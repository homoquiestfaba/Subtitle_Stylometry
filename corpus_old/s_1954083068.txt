This time, not a car, but ... -Lock the car?

Yes! I brought flowers.

I got flowers. -Do you have a plastic flowers.

Frankly, customers hate it. I hate it.

That you are honest, you would say that you hate them.

Å½vakaÃ¦a! Perfect.

Disgusting!

Hi! Did you decided to order?

Maybe it's in the bag. -Smart. Yes.

No, I missed it. Is that a horse?

Elephant. Surla me a little harder to go ...

What will you order a? -Food, yes!

Would you still consider? -Can. Thank you, Molly.

I still can not wait Jerry. Drinking coffee has already fourth in Addie Mae'su.

Coffee is good. Mark your to come back.

Yes, I am. -Call for you.

I heard a ringing cell phone, but I did not get back to you.

Interferometric gravity.

I Tuesday. Breakfast with Jerry at the new location. Smiling strangers. </ I>

Well, I hear it. Bye.

Here you go. Thank you.

Actually, this is for you. Thank you.

Did everything go okay? -Good.

Good.

Tulips. Flowers called tulips.

All right. Bye.

Bye.

Good morning, Ardis. -G. Gus, just thinking will you finally ...

Late? -But never late.

I was behind, he wants to talk to you. -I like your haircut.

Thanks Gus, but I'm going to cut until the afternoon.

I meant to tell you is so great, so that do not change too much.

Hey, Sam. Are you okay?

No, I do miss kamenÃ¨iÃ¦. Blue diamond. Have you seen him?

I think you've polished it some day.

Gus, you had it last.

Never mind, we'll find him. Mrs. Bing wants her brooch as soon as possible.

Can you handle it? -Mrs. Bing?

A lady who used too much perfume.

I do not know. Do not worry, you will know when namiriÅ¡eÅ¡.

Important - fix brooch Mrs. Bing.

I would not worry about GDI Bing, but a diamond. I need it.

I need you.

Search, blue diamond.

The end of the month. War of the loan, rent, tuition

stupid car blocked ...

If we at least one thing went right.

All right. How? -Jolene, I can not borrow from you again!

Let me at least help restore the car back.

How much?

Old sentence, new sentence, remove the padlock with rubber ...

Around $ 175. Nearly 200!

Here you go. -I'll come back.

I know.

How's it going with that legacy?

Impossible mission. I wonder if all that lost the case.

I live in a different way.

Starting from today! I'll take care of you financial situation,

interrupted with Roger! You were right! Who left the girl on her birthday?

That's it!

For a change, the next time Find NEKON decent and precious.

He's out there somewhere. -Jolene, nobody knows

you're a good person. Because we are roommates.

Because you are totally mistaken.

Hey, Gus!

Bye. I'm Bernadette, this is Max.

We live upstairs. Nice to meet you.

Already us know. -Good.

Let Gus alone.

Can we bring back those $ 5 you owe me?

You do not owe him anything! How many times do you have to say?

Stop talking to Gus owes you money! I He does not remember </ i>

I see anything from the previous day </ i>

Bernadette and Max!

Great! Thank you! -Until next time, Molly.

My dear, where are you?

Venus.

If you do not use social networks, why not use it?

Where are your sites, blogs? Do you know how to present

Twitter, Yelp, conduct a Google? The possibilities are endless

and the point is that if you do not know today how to keep your small business

then do not open.

I want to make a plan. It is your task to Monday.

Tell me your plan. You understand?

If you want an example, you can download it from the website.

I now look at some fresh flowers. It smells good. </ I>

I wonder what kind </ i>

I note that you are definitely back in Addie Mae's. </ i>

Hey, you do not know me and believe me, I'd never do anything like that. </ i>

I just wanted to thank you for noticing the flowers. </ i>

I Ä–inis a nice guy ... </ i>

I hope you will be Mars appear tonight. Or Venus </ i>

I wish you a nice day, a nice life. My name is Molly. </ I>

I with Jerry talks focused on Molly </ i>

I do not want to discourage. CvjeÃ¦arnica is a good idea

vision but are not well targeted. Think about the competition in the city.

I do not want to throw in something from just anything you will not be able to get away.

What do you know about your intention? Why cvjeÃ¦arnica?

Sometimes children make a wish staring at the stars.

I do it trgajuÃ¦i petals.

Arranging bouquets someone can brighten your day.

I know that it is not ambitious.

But you is ambitious. Therefore honor it and organize it.

Hi! Good morning!

Glad to see you!

You're late minute!

Are you okay? Wanna talk about it?

I know, I'm calling you every morning </ i>

You want me to come to you? I do not. There's no need. </ I>

Lucy, this is why I moved from California to New Orleans?

Yes, in order to be in a familiar environment. And that I can be with you

whenever you need me. And Jerry.

Thank you for helping me to handle this all in. ..

Helping me. I-What are sisters for? </ i>

Or I Venus </ i>

I wish you a nice day, a nice life. My name is Molly. </ I>

Remember Suzy Watkins from the 5th Grades? She gave you a gift for Valentine's Day.

What does that have to do with .. Or Lily Gazinski, 8th Grades?

She invited you to a little graduation. I had the chance!

Until you have moved to California. 12 years I've watched

how these women fall into your lap. And I? I've always watched TV with popcorn

and my sister. And then I even had a flat stomach.

Even you and Brenda liked more than me.

Who is Molly? Yes, Molly.

I'd say that's a good girl, probably not very much.

Sensitive, generous, with a strange sense of curiosity.

What luÃ°akinja leaves messages to strangers? How do you it seems?

I love it. Just you.

Waiting for my clients and the case that I get.

Come on now! Go! Okay, I'm going.

Yes, go now.

Sorry! -Oh my God!

Sorry, I did not mean to scare you.

Hi, I did not know that you're doing here.

I am. Do you remember me?

You Gus, do not you? I've been waiting for you.

Sorry if I scared the other day. It was one of those days.

In fact, today I was such a day. I sold it.

Pretty expensive. I got it as a gift.

I'm broke so I will accept half of its value.

I'm sorry, but today I can not help it. Then tomorrow? You tell.

No, not really.

Why? Because it is false.

Impossible! -Come, I'll show you.

Let's see. Yes, right there.

Original. Yours.

First, you can feel by touch.

Then you can feel the difference in weight.

And last, the original label that unfortunately out of your way.

Of course! -I'm sorry. Are you okay?

Junk lying fool!

What was it? I'm sorry, I did not ...

I Forever, Roger. </ i> It's okay.

I'm so sorry. I Forever </ i> is not really that long.

Thank you looked at him. You've got a nice ring with rubies.

This? -Yes. can you see it?

Half kamenÃ¨iÃ¦a missing. -Yes.

Nevertheless it is very nice. And there are many kamenÃ¨iÃ¦a in it.

It belonged to my aunt.

She has good taste.

Definitely.

It is a Victorian ring, rarely can find them.

$ 50.

I can not pay that much. Value-at least 50

I think ... I need money.

Here you go.

$ 200? I told 50 -Worth more than 50

No way you can pay less.

I've lived here three years already. I changed two cars,

four apartments, three boy and met countless strangers

and this is one of the most beautiful things that someone did for me.

Come on ... Thank you.

Sorry, what's your name? -Molly. My name is Molly.

Thank you again. -Yes. Molly, I wish you a nice day.

I SaÃ¨uvaj for Molly </ i>

What possesses? The jewelry?

I do not ... I do not know. He's nice. Just like you said.

Drag and bastard and, agreeable and dangerous ... How are you dear?

I think I have a good assessment.

Molly! What? I'm just nice to kind boyfriend.

What's wrong with that? -Take the floral pattern.

In it, you look desperately.

Hi, Sam.

I was looking for, but I think I've never seen a blue diamond.

Gus, we need to find him.

This just came. Someone pushed under the door.

I Dear Gus, thank you for noticing the flowers. You've made my day. Molly. </ I>

I sent you a wilted flower? I think that Molly calls out.

Literally and stalking. Send her a message or a call.

Neither is know her.

She left a message on that your recorder,

send a postcard, you would still need to know?

What else do I need to know?

You had an aneurysm, lost pamÃ¦enje, you have suffered a lot.

Be thankful you're still alive.

And to remember the important things before the nervous breakdown. Like me.

Gus, you're not living. We are all experienced trauma.

I am a divorced woman with whom I thought I spend my life.

I know it's not the same, but the call went out. What bad could happen?

Wait ... You and Brenda're divorced?

Yes! Will you go over? You're ruining my lunch.

Hi Molly, Gus here.

I Hi, you've Jolene. And Molly. SaÃ¨ekajte signal. </ I>

Who is Jolene? Hey.

Hi, few Bueno. I'm sorry. </ i>

Here Gus Gillenwater. The one I sent a message to Molly. </ i>

I've seen </ i> that I'm free on Friday. </ i>

Perhaps the Cafe Amelie.

They have delicious food.

I If it fits in 19:30 </ i> Meet me there.

To reiterate, here Gus Gillenwater.

Okay, bye.

I Make Payment salaries. And at 19:30 you have a date with Molly Cafe Amelie. </ I>

I Gus? Gus </ i> Hi, stay there.

Hello? -Gus?

Is that you? Bernadette.

My son Max and I live upstairs.

Thank God! That's better.

Sorry, I have problems with memory.

If you again, I asked for the name ... Good going, Gus.

Do you need something?

No, I think not. -Good. Good night.

Good night. -Max? Hi, what are you doing?

Molly?

Where's Molly? -In the back.

Molly!

Molly! Yeah? What are you doing?

I finished. Check the schedule. I work until 19:00. I have a meeting.

Oh, I'm sorry. Compound?

Hard to believe, but yes. -Is it a good boy?

I think so. You're a pretty girl, Molly.

And dear. Irresponsible, but nice.

're Worth. Someday ...

Blurs my mirror. -You look good.

Thank you.

I Hi, Jerry. </ i> Is' ugly?

Do not hang up, just say yes or no.

I Gus, where are you? </ i>

I at home. </ i> Is you serious?

I knew it! I Why are you home? </ i> That's why I live here.

Do not you know what tonight? Nothing special?

Are you dressed? I want you dressed for the compound when I come. I'm coming.

More bread? I do not need.

Thank you.

Did you intentionally blew? Say you are not. Jerry, I did not know!

It is no longer an excuse! It's not an excuse, but a fact.

This is unacceptable, why bother at all?

Because you're my best friend since I was six.

That's it. I'm glad you do not have to write every morning.

Do not call me anymore! Do not send me messages, e-mails or any signals!

I do not want to talk with a man who will only disappoint me!

Goodbye!

What if I'm better off?

Maybe my brain is just protecting. Or maybe you're just a coward.

Come in, look for it, eat something, listen to it ...

Maybe the kiss. Jerry!

If something goes wrong, you will not be anyway to remember in the morning.

A well told.

Flowers? Yes! What do you have?

Yes, $ 10. Thank you.

That's it? -Address the envelope.

Are you sure about this? -You look as if you regret,

Say you're sorry, give her a rose and begged for a second chance.

The fourth floor, apartment 417

Why do you care about this? -Let at least one of us has a love life.

What happened to Brenda? -Get out!

I open it </ i>

You have forgotten your keys?

I just got back. How was it ...

Hi!

This is for you! Sorry!

Probably they need water. I'll put them in water.

Here's the link. I'll ask and receive. </ i>

Otherwise, I'm more organized. I'm really sorry.

I feel terrible, Molly. Okay, what is this?

What? -This. Flowers. I'm Molly.

I know! I know.

I know. Just practicing.

For what? -For Molly.

I'm here.

This is for you! Roses, sunflowers not.

Although they are beautiful.

I did not ... You probably think ...

I do not really know what you mean, just ...

I want to accept these flowers as a sign of sincere repentance.

Or, as a sign of gratitude.

I'm really sorry, Molly, especially because I think you're so ...

Brilliant.

Wow! He just needs to keep.

Molly ...

Molly, do not you dare!

Try it now.

How'd you do that?

I'm good at mechanical things.

It would really be good.

I wanted to thank you for making me stop.

For a long time I did not even skim out.

With my job and everything else ...

Of course, I'm busy.

Trade you doing well? -Shop?

Your jewelry store where doing.

Where are we ... -No.

I mean, I work there, but not my jewelery.

The owner was a neighbor of my parents, before they died.

I've known them since childhood.

You want to go somewhere else? Sure.

Yes, I am studying at the same time, the waiter, can not wait something better.

I moved here three years ago from the northeast.

Thank you. -These are very tasty. Is not it?

Why did you move here?

To go fascinated. To be what I want.

And what would you be? Really?

I imagine a girl who is constantly worried that I would turn on her car,

which does not have hardly make ends meet,

which does not have to live in an apartment tuÃ°em, which can achieve something.

I want to be.

Is jewelry what you really want to know?

In fact, cosmology. -Hair?

No, although it's close.

Stars. Universe. I Cosmos </ i> - cosmology.

Actually, come with me.

A little to the left.

See how the harmonized? You mean like a horoscope?

Wrenched open a little. Sometimes squint you can see the stars ...

Do you see now? That's right there. See?

It is ... Teapot!

No, it's shopping carts. I can see, there are wheels

and that part there, it's pram! Am I right?

No, but nice try. Expertly run, it's Orion.

Right ascension to 5 pm, the deviation at 5 degrees ...

It's very scientific.

Where did you get that idea?

Or may be pram! Looks just like them!

And not just ... Making that up.

If you're curious about the universe, how is it that you do in a jewelry store?

Good question!

I worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California.

Before that, the OUR, I graduated at Caltech.

So why do not you do it?

I ...

Science is all around us, right?

For example, diamonds. When you look at them,

seems to have its own galaxy.

The way the light penetrates from them and reflects the ...

It can be wonderful. Sounds that stupid? I have such a feeling.

Not when you're talking about.

Look! See?

A shooting star! Yes! Right.

Technically, it was a meteor. But yes, it was a shooting star. Unbelievable.

How a bunch of stardust looks so

beautifully while burning the Earth's atmosphere.

Yes.

I gotta get back. Tomorrow I have a lot of obligations.

I. ..

On Sunday early raise.

Yes, I'm free on Sunday afternoon.

Will you give me a call on a date or not?

You mean the real date? -Yes. You show up on time,

do something normal, eating, talking ...

Can.

Then invite me on a date?

Sunday.

And this time I can remember, Molly. I promise.

All right.

Molly Brandford.

Tonight you have a date with Molly Brandford.

It was great.

Try to find a way to keep it.

I Molly Brandford. </ i>

Tonight I've had a date with Molly Brandford. </ i>

I was great. Try to find a way to keep it. </ I>

Do I pay you to write? The break-I.

I CvjeÃ¦arnica Molly petals </ i>

It's my job at the university.

My plan. I Molly's lovely petals. </ i>

Good. One day I'll work for you, but right now you're doing for me.

Break's over. Serve customers to third in the table.

I Do, I study at the same time and wait tables, </ i>

I can not wait a better opportunity. I moved before ... </ i> Who is it?

Girl.

A friend ...

With that tomorrow I have a date because we obviously went on a date last night

and it was very nice.

I. ..

I can not explain it, but I think I really like it.

Dressed because we have scheduled an appointment with a doctor.

You understand that your aneurysm destroyed hippocampus?

Yes. My old memories before aneurysms are normal.

Sorry, you probably already ask for the hundredth time,

but what about my new memories?

Otherwise healthy brain using sleep assimilate short-term memory.

When you around. Sleep you lose short-term memory.

With so complicated neurons, it is difficult to say

where information is stored.

Headaches?

I noted two. Lucy we developed a good system.

Excellent. I'm glad you that the system works.

To negotiate a new term? I can not live like this.

I want my brain back. I need it.

It is our goal and Gus. We are testing a promising treatment

and perhaps for a year ... I do not have a year!

Lucy has created this brilliant system and I am very grateful for that.

All of these procedures, which helped me to make my life work, but ...

I have no brief pamÃ¦enja not advance, and how could I?

Every time I try to do something new,

can not be given to it. I need this, I need new stuff.

I need to bring me closer to people

and not to forget them every damn day!

Please ...

If using my brain again to work.

Gus, he can not.

Yet. We will not give up.

Everything is possible.

Healed me!

Please!

Soon I will see you again. Are you sure you're okay?

Why would not I be? -Gus?

As for the new girls, if you're serious about it,

you have to tell her the truth. Otherwise it's not fair.

I love you. -Good.

You're gonna tell her? I hardly know her! As the name anyway? Molly?

Lucy is right. I decided.

To tell her that she can not remember the name of the day?

It's true, is not it?

And when her plan to admit? We put a little bit?

I'm gonna puke!

If you plan to tell her and hold her,

First is you have to win. Take the slip.

Skating?

Yes, skating. I took one girl and she was thrilled.

You cheated Brenda?

Brenda has another guy. We're separated!

More than a year ago. More accurately, 14 months and 22 days, but who's counting?

I'm tired of the constant repetition.

But Brenda was great! I know!

Signing the papers for the divorce was my biggest mistake in my life!

Why do you think treime? Give me that your recorder.

I know the perfect place where you'll take her.

The rink I Moonlight Dome </ i> How did you think of this?

A friend had recommended it.

I'm not dressed appropriately, and I really can not ... Watch out!

He was amused. And we can so.

All right. Come on!

Maybe we should try something else.

No, you're doing great. -Through!

Maybe we could get a bite.

It may, of course.

Ladies and gentlemen, the last of the evening is only for couples.

Thus, only couples. Get away from the rink!

OK, a bit of nostalgia for you golupÃ¨iÃ¦e. Enjoy!

What do you think?

Yes, you're doing good. -Approx.

Forget it, I'm just bad at this.

Molly, nobody cares. Look around you.

This is buffoonery.

Come closer. I promise you that I will not bite. Now the left.

Right, left, right. That's it.

Look, you catch the rhythm.

The upcoming turn. -I got you.

How long kliÅ¾eÅ¡?

I do not know. I always have.

I always? -Wait, painting.

See this turn! You did not turn around.

It was not bad!

Come on!

Excellent're doing. I'm fine.

Today was beautiful.

What would you do if you could choose?

I opened cvjeÃ¦arnicu.

You should not be.

Why would I laugh? -People are sometimes not that.

I suppose that sounds ridiculous. Irrelevant.

I do not sounds. Why is not already opened?

I'm waiting on some money.

My Aunt Ruth had no grandchildren

so the property has left me and my daughter.

They should divide the money but my cousin is stalling. -Awful.

Waiting to solve it,

I odugovlaÃ¨ila is a new beginning in my life.

I'm stuck, and I'm tired of waiting for something to happen.

I do not want to be afraid. Do you understand me?

Yes.

What is it? I tell Molly ... </ i>

Nothing. Nonsense.

But this is what I have done for you in the diner.

The rear part I'm not the best made, but ... Elephant!

It's very nice, thank you. I've seen it izraÃ°ujeÅ¡.

Another hidden talent. What I do not know about you?

I live here.

What is your apartment? Balcony with a telescope.

Terror. I've never looked through a telescope.

It should.

I mean, one should try.

Yes.

I have to go, but I'll see it. -Good.

Wanna talk about it? No!

I want to. You were right.

I'm furious at myself. Oh impossible.

You really like it? Very.

I literally threw herself at him. And what he did?

Maybe she married.

Do not do that tonight. I can not stand your cynicism.

Perhaps it is better to avoid, let the other pulls him.

42 years and no objection. Have you ever complained? I did not!

I, viÃ¨eÅ¡! We need to do this.

Blue diamonds do not just disappear!

No, Addie Mae's, when they ...

Great! Thank you, bye.

Hey, is everything okay?

Rehn insurance companies have is here, remember?

Glad to see you again, Gus. -Hi. What is going on?

Mr. Zed has a few questions about the blue diamond.

Where the blue diamond?

IznenaÃ°ujeÃ¦e is.

I was not sure he ... I do not know how I should feel.

It's not just one mountain, the mountain already.

I do not understand. What is there to understand?

A man sends you flowers because you want to know that he likes you.

I hope you like tulips. Gus </ i>

This is it? Molly?

It's very beautiful.

Is it serious? I do not know.

That's why I called you to come. Listen to this.

I ... can not wait to start my life. </ i>

I'm stuck, and I do not want to wait for something to happen. </ i>

I do not want to be afraid of. </ i>

I hate that I have to record our conversations but

it will be to remember what we have done and talked,

and I want to remember it. You guys should be to remember such things.

Her favorite flowers, dresses on the first date, ordinary things.

But it's not fair to go out with her.

It is fair to decide if alone. Did you tell her?

I wanted to. I intend to.

I think she really likes you.

What if I tell her and she did not mind at all?

Or if you tell her, and it's all over? -Here's your chance to find out.

That's it, is not it? Molly?

No, no! I'm not on the schedule. -Now it is.

I'm not on the schedule! -Good luck!

I'm not in the notes! What should I do?

Oh, God!

Hi! Hi!

I'm coming! I'm coming!

Just that little poÃ¨istim.

Molly, just a moment. -Gus?

Here I am.

Almost.

Bye. -Hi. Sorry, I should have called ahead.

No, I've arrived at the right time. Really? You did not?

Flowers is wonderful, I just wanted to thank you.

Also I have to ask you something. Sure, Come.

Would you like something to drink, a snack?

Or both? Oh whatever. Water?

Yes, the water arrives.

It's very scientific.

Yeah, you know already ... Milk or sugar?

What do you what do I need to bring? -Water.

Exactly!

No way! No way?

No chance of that?

Yeah, no chance. It is Ur.

My sister bought them because I loved Star Wars.

I still love them. You carry in your purse Chewbacca?

Scary! -The grapes are my best for you?

From orange. Excellent-have.

So ...

Your water! Thank you.

I like your apartment. Thank you, nice and mine.

You told me you've got to ask you something? -Yes, I ...

I wanted to ask you a couple of things ...

What is it?

This is the last important project on which I worked.

Remember the robot to explore Mars?

Spirit and Opportunity? -They run autiÃ¦i the remote?

They're made? Come on.

You created this new they were sent?

I'll get the coffee.

It says so much. I wish I could read it all.

Take it with you. I've already read many times.

Currently working on this? -For what?

Forbidden lines. New evidence on quintessencelike, Gustaf Gillenwater.

Gustaf? It sounds fancy, it's you? -I was once upon a time.

I was looking to throw something.

For thus?

Some trace. It soon as.

You've done all these amazing things and obviously you liked it.

how could you leave it all and move to New Orleans?

People change, Molly.

Sometimes these things just happen in life that affect your ...

I Visible comets, 19:30 </ i>

Come to show you something! Where are we going?

Watch your head.

All right, look over there. What do you see?

Is it a meteor? No, it's ... see here.

This is a comet.

Frozen gas, ice and dust, which extends the gravity of the Sun.

However, it is interesting to ...

What? -Talking about it as if you had it in you.

You had it in you. Actually, they all have.

It all starts.

All the elements in the universe come from stars.

Since it is made of. The calcium in our bones, the iron in the blood ...

It all kicked off with the explosion.

No star would not see anything, either me or you ...

So, we are stardust.

Yes. We are.

About 93%.

You know, sometimes it looks as if the comet lost.

And then return to orbit.

And when it counted, scientists realize that it is not at all lost.

Were found.

Stop for a moment.

I wish I could freeze this moment

how he would never forget.

Me too.

Molly, I have something ... No!

What does not? -My lecture!

I'm late! I'm done! My plan! Sorry, I'm stupid!

I have an important presentation tonight! I gotta go!

Call me!

I'll call you! I will not forget!

Hi! -I will not forget.

Call Molly. Do not forget! Do not forget!

Do not forget Molly Branford! Arrangements compound to tell her everything!

At all costs!

You think it's a good idea to tell her now? -We will find out.

Not every woman ... Wait a minute. What do you think?

I wrote all about Molly in the folder I Read it to me every morning </ i>

so that I can remember. I want it! -Some things take time.

You can not just tell someone something so important.

They can, if she is the right girl for me. -You say you love her?

I say ... I've recorded,

And after each day spent with her, just as I feel.

So maybe ... Yes, I love it.

Do you ispovraÃ¦aju triplets,

drunk girl fell while he goes to the bathroom ...

That's what I call entertainment.

Maybe this job is not for me ... SaÃ¨ekaj little.

I'll call you later.

Hello? Hey Molly, Gus.

Before you say anything, I'll explain

why I was acting so weird.

And that? It's hard to say over the phone.

I thought I'd take her somewhere special.

Not Molly, Jolene said. Roommate of Molly.

We met when you have me confused with Molly.

How many women hustling?

Call again and leave a message. I do not feel like it bother this.

I Hi, this is Jolene and Molly. SaÃ¨ekajte signal. </ I>

Molly, Gus. I need to talk to you,

explain some things. Meet me at sundown

zoo Otoban.

I got it? I'm waiting for you there. </ I>

I deleted message. </ i>

Sorry, we close early. Expected storm.

Yes, I do ...

I was waiting for someone.

Maybe she forgot.

I wanted to show her elephants. ELEPHANTS and will be here tomorrow.

You're lying, are not you? Tell me you're imagining!

I know I should not, but it was for your own good.

I will not let you destroy some clown life.

This Read it and tell me whether it's a clown.

Good. I do not know what his problem is.

Maybe you've got a problem. What?

The way you behave ... Would you prefer that I alone

and unhappy than to try to find a good one.

We both know that you bring a bad decision. I was protecting you.

This guy is different. He's nice and polite ...

And spontaneous. If you really think it's not good for me,

Why did you then say the message? You could pretend it was not there.

Because I've never seen something so desire.

Accident.

Cooperate with me, old tank.

Thank you!

You're mad, do not blame you. I'm not angry.

She would go there, not my fault. Roommate wiped message.

Then my car would not start, then rain ... I'm so sorry.

It's okay. Can I get a towel?

Thank you.

This is so sweet. You got our picture in the mirror.

I My girlfriend Molly. </ i>

Really it feel? -Yes.

Molly, I have a confession to make.

You're married. What? -Jolene was right.

Do you have a girlfriend? Tell me the truth.

Please come here.

I do not have a girlfriend. I have no wife. I'm not married.

But I have a problem ...

With memory.

I can not ...

That's your problem? That's your only problem?

Yes, but ... Oh please!

How am only things I forgot!

Sit down.

Bye. -Hi.

Something happened to me ... And me.

No, I mean before ...

Before you, before us.

Gus, I do not care what happened before we met.

Incredibly beautiful.

I do not want to lose. I want to keep it, you want to keep.

I want to keep your eyes your lips, your scent.

You smell the tulips.

What is it? Nothing. I'll let the music.

Are you filming us?

Just tonight or ...

Each of our meeting? I can not explain.

What are you going to do with it? Published on the internet?

No, why would I do that? I do not know. You're the one who takes us.

Do you have any cameras? I can not believe I did not anticipate.

You misunderstood. I'm sorry, I have to go.

I wanted to tell you, but you did not listen. Stop it!

My mind is not right. Every morning, I forget everything.

Stop it! I should listen to Jolene! How stupid of me!

You did not! Molly, you're stupid!

Oh, my God!

Molly, stop!

There is little uncertainty in your life. A little?

Much uncertainty. Everyone has questions.

Believe me, we all struggle with it. -I do not know where I am when I wake up!

I do not know what to do that day, in which city I live in, what we do.

I need a script that I knew what I was doing yesterday, whom I saw.

What people know whom should I believe?

And it will never change.

What should I do about it?

Try to go slowly.

With what you need to know to spend the day.

Is it possible to fall in love with someone every day?

No, Gustaf. Would not we all like that?

It's over, is not it?

Good morning. -Good morning.

I'm early.

I did not sleep well last night. -Today, no flowers?

Returning to the artificial, Baptiste. You win.

Something wrong? What is it?

You're not as usual.

You're scaring me! What is going on? -Did you hear about the execution?

You mean as a decoration?

As a student loan, like when you take part of government wages,

before you get.

I'm sorry, Molly.

This is ... I can not live without a salary!

I have to work I would go to college.

What should I do?

Here you go. I do not ...

I can not take it. Too.

Thank you, Baptiste!

It's all right, Molly. It's okay.

I do not understand. I scheduled.

The insurance company. Wolves do not want to admit the shelf.

Because of me? I can not work without insurance

and they will not renew my insurance if you keep.

Sam, firing me?

Listen, friends of your parents have a place in a chemical cleaner's.

Can you call them ... Sam, Sam ...

It's okay. See you.

I do not want a trainee, I want a real lawyer

which will deal with my case.

I'm tired of wrangling, it's been for two years.

I'm dying here.

Have him call me.

I Hi, this is Jolene and Molly. SaÃ¨ekajte signal. </ I>

I'm sorry, who are you? Lucy, Gus's sister.

I came here just to put something back.

I wanted to tell him that I'm leaving, I'm moving out.

Can you tell him goodbye for me ...

Actually, do not. He's in the hospital.

Observation. He'll be fine.

Would you like to sit?

I think I was trying to say.

Every day he had to re-learn who I am?

It happened on the 9th March

His brain has suffered prsnuÃ¦e anterior communicating artery in the hippocampus.

In other words, his brain is overheated.

He lost everything, right?

News Week, The New York Times, London Times,

The Washington Post, World Conference of scientists ...

He worked on quintessencelike.

Still works. He was supposed to be the next Einstein.

I wish you knew him then.

When did this happen? In March 2009th year?

This is the last thing that remembers?

Old memories of him remain forever losing sleep but new memories.

At first he tried to stay awake.

So when he wakes up ...

It must again learn about everything new in your life. Like you.

I found this morning in the trash.

We're out of fine desserts, but I have found you some pudding.

Thank you.

This is for you.

Thank you.

I press play </ i>

I I've had. But it's over. </ I>

I think you know better now and I hope we can </ i>

I start again because I fell in love with you. </ i>

I think that you and you feel the same. </ i>

That's me on the recorder.

Hi, Molly recorder.

Please, sit down.

I'm sorry, I do not remember you.

In fact, somehow and remember.

I made it about you? -Yes.

To be able to keep things

although it had every day poÃ¨injati again

anyway we can develop our story in. .. -To build something.

Yes.

I spent a long time waiting for something to happen.

I may have even blamed some people for their problems,

forgetting that I was alone responsible for their decisions.

But it ended.

I'm ready to take control of your life in. ..

I hope I will do that for you.

ShvaÃ¦aÅ¡ to ...

All you'll ever have a day

and many old juÃ¨eraÅ¡njih days.

No, you got me.

Can you ...

You can get a little closer? Why? I wrote good?

How could I forget?

Hi, Molly.

Bye.

As I said, it is a special occasion.

Yes, you started talking. What's going on?

I discovered an exciting opportunity.

And that is?

There is a new laser surgery.

Let me show you.

This is a photo of the brain, much like what is yours.

This is a photo of the same brain, but patient.

They have not perfected the process, but are close.

Anticipate great success.

Gus, this might help.

I do not know ... Are you sure? You're the perfect candidate.

Young, healthy, we just need to fill out paperwork.

I can not pay. -No.

I want nothing more than that, but I can not let you pay.

Before odluÃ¨iÅ¡, I'd take you to a place.

Where? -Sunday.

I want to take you somewhere where we can talk some more about it.

We'll just leave. Just the two of us.

Gus, remember Sunday.

Okay? -I remember.

Remember to ask for the surgery and remember to ask ...

Molly? Hi, stranÃ¨e.

Yes, Molly.

So, where are you taking me?

Sorry, I'm taking you somewhere?

Here you go.

Airline tickets to Los Angeles.

I want to see where you come from. I want to know what proportion taken remember.

So that's it? Here you doing?

Yes, in that big, with the biggest telescopes.

I think you can not go in there. I thought I might be able to, but I can not.

Why?

Please.

I can not. I'm so sorry. Can we get back to the hotel?

I thought you'd want to see this place again.

You do not have to watch it.

I see it every morning when wake-up call, every night before bedtime.

I can not stop watching.

It represents everything I ever wanted, all whereof I had to give up,

all I have taken and now I'm alone!

You are no longer alone.

I was there when it happened.

That's the last thing I remember, and whereof I always to remember.

Gus, I'm sorry. I did not know.

But I should know. If we try together,

I must be the person to whom you'll be able to tell you.

Please, just a little show.

Do not ask me, please.

Then I see myself.

This is incredible!

This is your office.

That was my life.

Everything I learned about the universe through the big glass.

Through you watched?

Who's there? We're all here.

Bilmos, Lukrey ...

Welcome back, Dr. Gillenwater. -Welcome home, Gus.

We're pretty busy lately.

Ruth was worried whether I want to go back home at all.

Still not over and there are still a lot of work,

but I think it will be interesting to you. Krida, show the chart.

Here it comes. -Prepare.

What are you doing? -Wait ...

Is this verified? For now.

If it still continues, will definitely change things.

Gus, this is your report.

Fast facts?

Quintessence? Molly gave them to us.

When she called to make an appointment.

I sent your note, I thought you were finished, how do I know.

Putting it mildly.

If these data are correct, we have just found

way for the monitoring of dark energy in the universe.

And if we can ... Then we will know the fate of the universe.

We call I Gillenwaterov effect. </ I> We hope you do not mind.

So will the whole world be called. This can not be forgotten.

Thank you, guys. Thank you all.

Honey, thank you.

It used were not so long ago, giants like Hubble, even Einstein

stood exactly there where you're standing.

I have used this same telescope to

changed our view of the universe forever.

Shivering! Are you cold? It's not from the cold.

Oh, yeah. -Maybe a little cold.

Here you go.

Thank you. In what I see now?

United light of millions of stars.

I could watch it forever.

Actually, could it because the universe is not only expanding but also accelerating.

There is simply no end. We know that now.

Forever. Comforting, is not it? -Gillenwaterov effect.

I Do not forget to ask. </ i> What? -Gus!

Thank God you're still here.

I wanted to sell a few more questions before you go.

Will take only a few minutes.

Go ahead, I'll wait in the car. -Good.

We worked together and we were engaged.

I assumed that someone had, but I did not know.

What happened?

We were in love, then an aneurysm in. ..

For months I tried.

His sister had decided to take, and I wanted to go but ...

In the end I could not.

You left him. But not for him.

I wanted to have children. We could have just ...

them he would not be remembered. -Yes.

Do not tell him to meet you. Better that way.

We're sorry. Molly, I'm glad that I met you.

Me too.

Are you okay? What is it? I'm fine.

Do you wake up every morning expecting that you'll

be here to work with your friends?

Every morning I wake up I'm not sure of anything.

Molly, I want to try with that operation. Really?

Gus, it's ... -Molly!

If the operation fails, I want to tell me something obeÃ¦aÅ¡.

I want you to obeÃ¦aÅ¡ you'd forget me

and delete it from my life. What? I will not!

Listen to me!

When I'm with you all seems fine.

I wish I would have been enough.

Never and I'm not going to remember in the morning.

Because it's possible that will never recover.
