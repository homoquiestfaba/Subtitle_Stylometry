Just what I need. An alarm pig.

Hungry? Want to eat this?

Shit!

Hi, Max.

We can forget about
the Kolchek account.

Why?

I'd consider it moot since
Mr. Kolchek was found

with a screwdriver embedded in
his skull at 10:30 last night.

Apparently Mrs. Kolchek decided

to conduct her
own investigation.

You're kidding.

Apparently her
suspicions were correct.

I knew she was trouble as
soon as she walked in here.

Both eyes moved in
different directions.

Still, a screwdriver?

I mean, who doesn't cheat
on their wife these days?

I hope you don't, Max.
I really do.

If I did, at least I'd know
how to get away with it.

Yeah, well, so did Mr. Kolchek.

May I help you?

Isn't it against the law to
smoke in an office building?

You must be Mrs. Farrow-Smith?

Hey, Mr. Farrow-Smith. You said
you'd let me take her out one day.

Only if I can drive yours.

What do you want to drive
my old beater for?

For the experience, Geri.
For the experience.

Do you mind?

Be my guest.

If you want to die.

Well, that's just a matter
of timing, isn't it?

Okay. You said on the phone

that you had some concerns
about your husband?

That's one way of putting it.

I am a woman who likes to
know where she stands.

Have you seen any changes
in his behavior?

You mean like losing
weight, exercising,

cutting his hair,
and buying a new car?

No, Mr. Isaac, there
haven't been any signs.

I would be disappointed
if there were.

My husband is never
obvious or predictable.

Let's just say that we've reached
the point in our marriage

where it would be
in my best interest

to know what he's like
when I'm not around.

Well, Mrs. Farrow-Smith, that is
a service that we do provide.

Good. Draw up whatever paperwork
you think is necessary.

Oh, one more thing, I would
like a woman working the case.

A woman? Uh...

I would have to see.

I'd be much more
comfortable with a woman.

I saw one earlier in the hall.

That would be Derian McCall.

Oh.

Fine, whoever.

She's a good investigator.

Good.

As far as the matter
of a retainer...

Oh. Just bill me whatever
you think is fair.

<i>Keeping something out or in?</i>

My eyes are very
sensitive to light.

Don't they have a vitamin
for that or something?

Why do you want your husband
investigated, Mrs. Farrow-Smith?

I want to know if he's
fucking someone else.

You have any reason
to believe that he is?

Only a too-keen memory.

Memory?

I remember what he was like when
it was still new between us.

My husband requires a certain
freshness to the feel of things.

The need for a conquest?

We're attracted to men
of power and vitality.

And those are
the very qualities

that make them
impossible to hold on to.

"We," Mrs. Farrow-Smith?

You married?

No, I most certainly am not.

But you are.
Tell me about your husband.

Do you have anything tangible?

Any strange hours,
phone calls at night?

He's too smart.

Have you come out
and asked him?

I'm too smart.

I quit.

You know, some women just
choose to look the other way.

Are you trying to deter me?

Are you sure you can handle
what it is I find out?

Do I look like the type
who would fold on you?

I really can't say.

What I do require is
absolute confidentiality.

Being a fool is one thing. A
public fool is quite another.

I understand.

Whatever records
you keep, no copies.

Everything's for my eyes only.

Did Max explain the charges?

Whatever it is, I'm sure it'll
be worth my peace of mind.

If that's what you're buying.

How do you always know where to find
me when I don't want to be found?

I think it's a detective
kind of thing.

Mmm.

Thanks for coming.

Is the term "happy hour"
in your vocabulary?

It depends what
you mean by "happy."

Can you spell double
Scotch on the rocks?

Let's get a move on.

<i>I have to get rid of the scum.</i>

<i>They clutter up this city,</i>

<i>ruining every day for me.</i>

<i>I hate them all.</i>

<i>I pass by them on the street.</i>

<i>I made a commitment to myself</i>
<i>to kill everybody.</i>

<i>I have a couple of days</i>

<i>to clear the streets</i>

<i>for nice people.</i>

We're talking clear from A
Street to the river, yeah?

We got that franchise?

Your people won't even get
so much as a parking ticket.

It's comforting to know the
tradition of cops having a price

is alive and well in this city.

Oh, yeah.

Just one more thing.

What's that?

Take off your shirt.

What are you talking about?

Maybe I got
a thing for nipples.

That's bullshit, man!

Sit down. Get off!

Shut up and show me
you're not wired.

Carl, you don't
have to do this.

I told you I know his people.

Come on, let's see
you're not broadcasting.

Did your gun jam?

Carl! Put the gun down.

You kill a cop,
you're looking at

a real fucking
reduction in lifestyle.

I don't believe you.

Put the gun down, Carl.

You got the best lawyer in town.
You can skip on this.

Don't throw your life away. Put the gun down!
Do you hear me?

Carl, put it down.

Put that gun down, Carl.

Fuck!

Jesus, Ray, it looked like she
might have been defusing it.

"Might have."
Couldn't take that chance.

Besides, he was lined up
real nice in the crosshairs.

Good shot. Let's go.

<i>Â¶ Falling in so far</i>

<i>Â¶ Looking up because</i>
<i>we're headed away</i>

<i>Â¶ We are</i>

<i>Â¶ Before I'm the one I will
be reaching out for you</i>

<i>Â¶ And holding on too much.</i>

What can I get you?

<i>Â¶ I can remember how we were</i>

<i>Â¶ Then</i>

<i>Â¶ You know that everything</i>
<i>will be all right.</i>

She's got quite the voice, huh?

Yeah.

What do you think
it is that separates

the ones that make it
from the ones that don't?

Timing.

That's it.

I mean, just think of all
those pompous assholes

who take everything from
life as if they've earned it

when all that's really happened

is they weren't
where the bullets hit.

What do you do for a living?

Medical electronics. Sales rep.

That's interesting.

Have you noticed that's all
anybody talks about these days?

Violence, guns, death.

Just making conversation.

But you just met me, and already
you're talking about bullets.

Whatever happened to rides in the
country, picnics, cotton candy?

You want to go get
some cotton candy?

No. Not with you.

<i>Â¶ I realize</i>

<i>Â¶ We may only last a while</i>

<i>Â¶ But it's worth</i>
<i>everything I have</i>

<i>Â¶ To see you smile Â¶</i>

Hello?

<i>Hi. It's Derian McCall.</i>

Ah.

So, it all looks really
like business to me,

and now he's in
his office alone.

Yes. Well, no one ever accused
Michael of not being a workaholic.

Yeah. Well, in this case,
that might be a good thing.

So...

What do you think
of my husband so far?

What do you mean?

Michael's the kind of man
who leaves an impression.

I'm hired to make observations,
Mrs. Farrow-Smith,

not give reviews.

The observer and the observed.

Perhaps his charm works
better at closer distances.

I wouldn't know.

<i>You don't even know yet</i>
<i>why I married him, do you?</i>

Actually, what I can't figure
out is why he married you.

My gut tells me this is
all I'm going to find.

The only woman that came
within any proximity

of your husband was this one.

But they were then
joined by this man.

That would be
Susan and Bill Novick.

My husband's been courting their
money for the past six months.

You sound disappointed.

Did you ever wake up in
the middle of the night

and think you hear rats?

But you still can't
get back to sleep.

I wouldn't have thought you would
have much experience with rats.

I may surprise you yet.

I'd like to keep you
on retainer.

Listen, honestly, I can
spend a lot of your money

following your husband around.

I don't want you to follow him.

What do you want?

I'll never really be certain

until I see how he reacts
to the right temptation.

This was it from the
beginning, wasn't it?

I just spent a week
spinning my wheels.

You're the only one
who can do it.

I'm sorry, but I think you
might be in the market

for a different type
of professional service.

I'm just talking about a
little harmless flirtation.

It's a test.

It's the only way that
I'll ever know for sure

that I can trust him,
that's all.

It's not really part
of my job description.

I'll double your salary.

Help me.

I need you.

Legally this would be considered entrapment.
You know that.

It's got nothing
to do with the law.

All right.

As far as anyone knows,
this is a straight

watch and follow,
Mrs. Farrow-Smith.

I think, Derian, that when
one woman asks another woman

to try to seduce her husband,

first names are in order.

Set?

I'll whack you.

That was a good one.

Wednesday?

Talk to me after my bypass.

You got time for a drink?

I think I'm going to
hit the weight room.

Lift a couple for me.

You got it.

I'll talk to you tomorrow.

All right. Take care. Okay.

Great game.

Oh!

I'm sorry. It's my fault.
Are you all right?

I'm going to kill someone if I don't
start watching where I'm going.

You didn't happen to see a
dark-haired girl, short, curly hair?

No. You lost your partner?

Today's Tuesday, right?

All day.

Oh. I bet she said
Thursday. Shoot!

Good luck.

Thanks. Yeah.

Hey! It would be a shame
to waste a reserved court.

I'm not that good anyway.

That's all right.

I am.

<i>Â¶ Never</i>

<i>Â¶ Never</i>

<i>Â¶ Never gonna fall</i>

<i>Â¶ Never gonna fall</i>

<i>Â¶ Never gonna</i>
<i>fall in love again</i>

<i>Â¶ Never gonna</i>
<i>fall in love again</i>

<i>Â¶ Never</i>

<i>Â¶ Now you want me Â¶</i>

Are you okay?

Fine. Looks like
our hour is up anyway.

Yeah. Here.

Thanks.

It was fun playing
above my level.

It's the only way to learn.

Drink? Loser buys?

No, I've got
a rush hour to beat.

But next time you lose your
partner, please look me up.

I'd like to play. I enjoyed it.

Great. Thanks.

Thanks. Bye.

I don't think he's interested.

<i>Maybe you need to try harder.</i>

Michael's very perceptive. If
anything is off, he'll notice.

Even the slightest thing.

<i>You have to be flawless.</i>

Maybe I'm not his type.

<i>Yes, you are.</i>

<i>Believe me, I know my husband.
You're his type.</i>

I don't know how comfortable
I am with this.

With Michael, it gets easier.

<i>What if after all</i>
<i>this there is nothing?</i>

<i>Are you going to be</i>
<i>happy with that?</i>

Do you think it's
possible for any of us

to resist the right temptation?

I really can't say.

You don't know how much
I need you to find out.

Shots twenty.

Okay, guys, party's over.

All right. See you later.

I'm serious. Get the
fuck out of here.

I just have to go do something.

Yeah? Yeah. I'll
just be right back.

Derian McCall
for Mr. Farrow-Smith.

She says she has
something for him.

He left it at
the racquetball court.

It'll be one moment.

Hi.

Hi.

It must've popped out of
your bag when I tripped.

By the time I saw it,
you were gone.

My God, I've been looking
for this for two days.

You have keen eyes.
I'm glad you found it.

Thank you.

Nice view.

It's something, isn't it?

I put myself through
college driving a taxicab.

I spent my life down there in the
filth and the heat and the traffic.

I promised myself
if I ever made it,

I'd get as far away
from that as possible.

When I got up here,

everything just
started to make sense.

From here, you can view
the world at a distance.

I don't need much else,

not even a watch.

You should take better care
of your valuable things.

I have been told that before.
Please, come sit down.

Looks old.

My father gave it to me after
I graduated high school.

It's supposed to be lucky.

It seems to have worked.
You got your view.

I don't remember
giving you my last name.

How did you find me?

I recognized your face.

I've seen you on the financial
page a couple of times.

That's funny. You don't strike
me as a financial page type.

It's just something
to read when I'm stuck

down there in the traffic
and the filth.

Well, it's not very often

that someone goes to so much
trouble for a perfect stranger.

It wasn't that much trouble.

Nonetheless, I feel like

I want to give you some
kind of a reward, but...

Something tells you
I wouldn't take it?

Well, would you?

No.

Well, I better be going.

Um...

Well, maybe at least
I could buy you a drink.

We're back to talking "reward"?

No.

I would just simply
like to buy you a drink.

I'll meet you back here at 8:00.
How's that?

Bye. Bye.

Let's see now, I forget.
Who owes who?

Don't give me shit, Falco.

Did you make the call?

Yeah, Mr. Wall Street, right?

Did you find anything?

Let's see. Here we go.

Well, like we knew,
he's dick-deep

in other people's money,
that's for sure.

He buys, sells,
and takes his cut.

High stakes shit. But as far
as anyone downtown knows,

he's done nothing that'll pop
a woody on Mike Wallace.

Why are you interested?

I'm doing a marital on the guy.

Well, I've got a call
to Maryanne with the Feds.

She'll let me know
if he doesn't squeak.

Thanks, Falco.
I really appreciate it.

Hey, you were
a good cop, you know?

What the hell are you doing
following cheating husbands around?

It pays the light bill.
What can I tell you?

You're doing all right, huh?

I'm doing okay, yeah.

Derian, I was always
on your side.

You just walked away too soon.
You could have made it.

Made what?

I wouldn't have thought this
would be your kind of place.

Well, I stopped having my
shirts stuffed a few years ago.

That's not what I meant.

Of course it is.

I started coming here
when I was going to college.

Business school?

Medicine.

Really?

No shit.

What happened?

Everybody seemed to be
into it for the money.

And all they ever talked
about was stock options.

So I decided to
cut out the middleman.

And you?

I...

I was a cop.

You're kidding.

On the job four years
and two months.

You're serious.

I just wasn't very good at it.

Bullshit.

So what did you work?

Vice.

Undercover.

Why did you quit?

I don't know you
well enough to say.

Fair enough.

So what do you do now?

Insurance claims.

It's not that different
from police work, really.

A little legwork,
a lot of paperwork.

I'm married.

I just wanted to let you know.

I didn't want to give you
the wrong impression.

Well, I'm single,

for what it's worth.

It's not that I have
a perfect marriage.

Far from it.

But I don't cheat.

And I didn't
want you to think...

Would you excuse me
for a moment?

<i>I would just simply</i>
<i>like to buy you a drink.</i>

<i>I'm single,</i>
<i>for what it's worth.</i>

<i>I don't believe you.</i>

I've just have to
go do something.

Damn, she pulled the wire.

Not again.

The signal's dead.

I'm addicted to
everything about you.

<i>You can't let it get to you.</i>

Are you okay?

Sure.

You haven't said much
since we left.

I guess I'm just tired.

Come on!

What the hell?

What are you doing?

Hold him! Hold him down!

Light him up, man.

Spark him up.

I'll be right back.

Get the fuck out of here!

Why don't you mind
your own business, asshole?

Let him go.

You want to fuck with me? Huh?

Get the fuck out!

You all right?

Hey! Hey!

I just want to help.
I just want to help!

What the fuck is
wrong with people?

It was a gang initiation.

Gang initiation?

They got to kill
somebody to get in.

Let's get out of here. Come on.

Poor guy.

Are you all right?

It scared the shit out of me.

You didn't look scared.

No?

It didn't seem to stop you.

Yeah, well, it helps not having enough
time to consider one's options.

I think that's what
defines us as people.

How you react when there's
no time to think, you know?

A couple seconds either way, everything
would be different for all of us.

Jesus Christ!

It was so stupid
getting out of the car.

I'm sorry.

Goddamn it.

You saved that guy's life.

I'll walk you in.

It's like 10 feet away.

Please.

Thanks for the drink.

I really think it was
brave, what you did.

Well, it certainly was
an exciting night.

About what I said at the bar...

No, you don't have to.

Please, I would like to.

A lot of times, I wish
things were different.

But they're not.

So...

Yeah.

You better watch out. They tow
here in two seconds flat.

Right. Thanks for the tip.

I had a great time.

Me, too.

Bye.

You've been cooped up all day.
You want to go out, don't you?

Come on.

Here we go.

Just what I wanted to do.

Okay.

Don't you eat?

You get skinnier
every time I see you.

I eat, Max.

Mr. Farrow-Smith getting any?

The Farrow-Smith case?
What's the status?

Oh, there's...

There's nothing there.

You found the only faithful
husband in America.

I'll alert the media.

I'm closing it out today. Good.

I got a missing kid on
hold, probably a runaway,

but his parents
work for the UN.

Are you hearing this?

Yeah. Yeah.

Good. Close out
Farrow-Smith and you're up.

Michael didn't
come home last night.

I know.

Did you...

You got what you wanted.

Did you get what you wanted?

Don't play that with me.

This was your manipulation.

As I recall, the idea was
to tempt him, not fuck him.

Was it?

You have to tell me everything.
What was he like?

Tell you everything?

Yes. Don't you see?

Now I know what
he's capable of.

This is how you get
your kicks, isn't it?

You were hired to do a job.

Unless it's become personal.

Oh, well, I think
there's some things

you need to know
about my husband.

He's not what he seems.

I'm through with both of
you and your game playing.

What about his games?

You think you're going
to be able to leave him

now that you've let him in?

Just watch me.

Derian! Wait! Wait!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I lied, all right?

I did want you to follow him,

but I wasn't manipulating you.

What do you think? You think I
want you to sleep with my husband?

The truth is, I thought
that in following him

you'd uncover
his business deals

and the people
that he's involved with.

What are you talking about?

He's gotten involved in some
high-risk transactions.

And I'm scared of the people
that he's dealing with.

Oh, shit!

Everything is
spinning out of control

and he's become violent,
and he hit me.

Michael doesn't seem like the
kind of guy to hit a woman.

Excuse me. Could I have
a little seniority here?

I think I know my husband
better than you do.

I'm afraid that both Michael and
I are going to end up dead.

And I need you. I need you
to stay close to him.

I need you to find out
what's going on

so that I can get us out of it.

Does Michael know
you put me on to him?

No. Are you... No!

And I'm sorry I lied,
I really am. I just...

I didn't know what to do.

I'm scared.

Jake Halstead.
Real estate maven.

Disappeared about
three years ago.

We figure he's
playing goldfish tag

right about now
with Jimmy Hoffa.

He was in bed with
your boy for a while.

They were connected through a
series of holding companies.

Nominally legal, of course.

And then when
Halstead disappeared,

he also disappeared
with a shit load of money

formerly in the possession of

some seniors in
the Boca Raton area.

And of course
they wound up with

a nice piece of
alligator hunting ground.

Halstead disappears
and Farrow-Smith prospers.

The guy lands
on his feet every time.

Right now his company is under
investigation by Justice.

For what?

Well, ostensibly, he's still
involved in real estate.

I mean, he buys down
and sells up.

But he's been involved with
some guys in organized crime,

and we really think that he's
using the realty company

as a front for
a money laundering operation.

Do you have any evidence?

Do I have any evidence? Yeah.

A little inference

and a lot of gut feeling.

Which is why
I want to talk to you.

I mean, you're already
on the inside.

You could be a big help to us.

Inside?

I'm not asking you
to wear a wire.

I just want you to
keep your eyes open.

Falco will be our contact.

Come on, what do you say?

I'm sorry.

But I can only work
for one client at a time.

Okay.

I'm sorry, Falco.

It's not your fault.

Tell me something, are you involved
with this Farrow-Smith guy?

Excuse me?

Just asking.

Three more seconds.

That's all I needed,
was three more seconds.

You can't let it get to you.

He was dropping his gun.

Why didn't they wait?
I was talking him down.

We weren't willing
to take that risk.

It doesn't take
three seconds to know

you'd trade dead
criminals for dead cops.

And these were our people. You hesitated.
You could be dead.

I didn't hesitate.
I didn't shoot him.

Why did you shoot him?

Sometimes you just have
to expedite the scene.

Aren't we supposed
to be the good guys?

Listen, the report is going to read
that when Joey's gun jammed...

...that's when we made
the call to drop him.

You with me on this?

Negative on blood on the floor.

Well, I stabbed him pretty good
with this, in the shoulder.

Anybody turns up in the ER with a
chunk of wood in his shoulder,

we'll turn him on a spit.

You're telling me
everything, right?

Of course I am.

I mean, you know,
'cause I'm thinking

some guy you've gotten
the skinny on,

somebody with a lot to lose,

wants to take a look
at your records.

They're kept at the office.
Anybody would know that.

I don't know. Maybe somebody
just wants to make sure

you're not holding on to
something for future reference.

It would take me a week to even

figure out what was
missing from this.

We'll take this to the lab,
check it for blood residue.

Looks like this tip
has been broken clean off.

I'm still checking for prints.

Check out the pig. Hey, piggy.

You okay, Derian?

Yeah, I'm just
pretty shaken up.

Hey.

Someone broke into my apartment
last night while I was there.

Are you all right?
Did you get hurt?

I'm okay.

The police came. It's over.

Did they catch him?

No.

Derian, come here.

I'm sorry.

I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

All I want to do is
be able to take care of you.

Protect you.

Somewhere there waits a wife.

Somewhere, but not waiting.

All I can think about is how much
I want to be with you right now.

Yeah?

I can hear all the
years just rushing by

like some kind of
runaway train.

All I have to show for it is
a house with no furniture,

and an empty marriage.

Michael...

Why don't you level with me?

Why the sudden interest?

Do you prefer
to keep it casual?

There is nothing

casual about us.

You're everything that I want.

That's a dangerous statement.

You're like an addiction.

Yeah.

And you're a married man.

Yes, I am.

I don't have to be.

You know, I often think about how
pleasant life would be without Anthea.

Is that an idle thought?

Well, she could take
a tumble down the stairs.

Excuse me?

Jesus Christ, Derian,
I was joking.

Besides, I think
she's seeing someone.

She's been acting
very strange lately.

Meetings she has that
she won't talk about.

Places that she
has to go by herself.

Just the other day,

I found this in her car.

It's a man's ring.
She knows I found it.

But of course, she can't
talk to me about it.

I even thought of
hiring someone.

Hiring someone?

Yes.

A detective.

Do you want the job?

What do you mean?

It's not exactly insurance
investigation, but...

Derian, what's the matter?

Nothing. I just...

You just what?

Oh.

I guess you're throwing
a lot of information at me.

You're right. I'm sorry.

Anthea is my problem.

Do you love her?

We've just been going through the
motions for a very long time now.

But you care if she's
seeing someone else,

even though you're
right here with me.

No. I just want
to know where I stand.

I thought it was
the husband we were on.

Change of plan.

Buzzer doesn't work.

I noticed.

I'll have to come down.

A women with her kind of money

hanging out with
a loser like him.

That doesn't make sense.

Travis, your powers
of perception are uncanny.

Uncanny.

What? What did I say?

Finally.

Do you meet many of
your clients here?

Yeah. I wind up in a lot
of fun places with my job.

Are those bullet holes?

Yeah, .45s.

Two guys got shot.

Don't touch them.

Then the car was stripped,

the dead bodies
are still inside.

God, that's horrible.

I'm just doing the insurance
write-up for the car.

We document the damage
for the underwriter.

What will they do with the car?

Why? Are you interested
in buying it?

After it's out of impound,
they'll fix it up,

and sell it to somebody
who will think

they got a deal on
an almost-new BMW.

I just hope karma
doesn't cover cars.

Bye, Joe.

Okay, Derian.

You said you had
something to show me.

A little extra service bonus?

Knowing what's going on
keeps me alive.

Who is this guy?

None of your business.

I didn't ask you to follow me.

No. You just gave me
four different stories

of why I should
follow your husband.

You're worried he's cheating,

you're worried he's violent,

you want me to sleep with him,

you're scared of
his business partners.

And just as one story
turns out to be bullshit,

a sliver of it twists and
spins into the next story

blurring the lines of what's
really true and what isn't.

What are you hiding, Anthea?

Hmm?

Who is this guy?

How do you know he's not my
down-on-his-luck brother?

Well, for one thing,
you're an only child.

It's so nice to know
I hired a pro.

You know what I think? I think
you wanted out of your marriage,

but on your terms,
with leverage.

I was the lever.

I'm officially
off the job, Anthea.

Goodbye.

It wasn't too hard for you
to blur that line, was it?

Did watching him for me make it

that much more
interesting for you?

I don't know.

You put me undercover as bait,

hoping Carl would bite hook
and I'd get him that way.

Then you didn't let me
do my fucking job!

Your fucking job is to walk
out of a situation alive.

You did. That's right, I did.

And you had somebody killed
that you didn't have to.

The call was made.
We stand by it.

That's great.
'Cause you know what?

I'm done.

It'll be here
when you come back.

<i>- Mr. Farrow-Smith?</i>
Yes, Janice.

<i>Line 2, Derian McCall.</i>

Can you have her hold, please?
I'll be right on.

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

Thank you.

Derian.

<i>Hi, Michael.</i>

I was just thinking about you.

I'm standing at
my office window,

imagining you
down there somewhere.

Michael, it has to end.

<i>What's the matter?</i>

Everything.

Derian,

we have done nothing wrong.

All you have done is
forced me to face the fact

that my marriage has been
over for a very long time.

Michael, please, it has to end.

<i>Christ, Derian,</i>
<i>you can't do this.</i>

Not like this.
Not on the phone.

That's the only way
I can do it.

<i>I'm sorry. You know,</i>

it really is something up here.

All this randomness

somehow has some
kind of special order,

if you just see it
from the right distance.

<i>Derian, that's what</i>
<i>you have to do.</i>

<i>You have to see this</i>
<i>from the right distance.</i>

I just need some time. Then you
and I, we can be together.

Michael...

I have to hang up now.

Okay, Derian.

You do what you have
to do, and so will I.

Hello?

<i>Derian, it's Travis.</i>
<i>Can you get over here?</i>

What is it?

There's something I want
you to take a look at.

It's our boy from
the low-rent district.

I'm off that job, Travis.

<i>Yeah. But I think you're
going to want to see this.</i>

Why?

Would you just get over here?

Okay.

<i>All right.</i>

<i>I'm going to run out. If you get here
first, you know where the keys are.</i>

Don't go drinking
my last beer, all right?

Travis!

Travis, I was...

<i>Derian, you have to help me.</i>

Who is this? <i> It's Anthea.</i>

<i>Michael's going to kill me.</i>

What are you talking about?

<i>I called him on everything.</i>

<i>The people he's been doing business
with, fucking with my trust fund,</i>

<i>you, everything.</i>

<i>He hit me, Derian. He
pushed me down the stairs.</i>

What?

<i>He just kept hitting me.</i>

<i>I'm bleeding. I'm so scared.</i>

Where is he now?

<i>He's upstairs, I think.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>God, he's out of his mind.</i>
<i>It's totally dark here.</i>

<i>He pulled the circuit</i>
<i>breakers, I think.</i>

Do you hear me? When I hang up here,
I want you to call the police.

<i>Oh, God, help me.</i>

I'm coming over.

Call the police, Anthea. Okay?

<i>Okay, okay.</i>

Anthea?

Anthea?

Anthea?

He went crazy.

Did you shoot him?

It went off.
It hit the ceiling.

All right. Give me the gun.

Give me the gun.

Where is he?

I don't know.
I think he's upstairs.

Did you call the police?

I want you to go outside, okay?

Go outside and wait
for the police to get here.

Will you be okay? Yeah.

I'm going to see
if he's still here.

Michael?

Michael?

Move, move!

Yes, sir.

If anybody is in the house,

I want you to identify
yourself now.

Anybody in the house,
come out with your hands up.

Let me see your hands! Put
the gun down, nice and slow.

Put your hands in the air.
Turn around!

Put your hands on your head.

Do you have any weapons on you?

Waistband.

Okay, check it out.

Come on, Ms. McCall.

Derian, it doesn't look good.

They have an eyewitness
in Mrs. Farrow-Smith,

a small mountain
of circumstantial evidence.

Your fingerprints are all
over the murder weapon.

It looks like you were involved
with a romantic triangle,

and Michael Farrow-Smith
was killed over it.

That may be our best tact.

Heat of passion, lean
toward temporary insanity.

It's workable
if we get the right jury.

Only it never
happened that way.

She set me up
so she could kill him.

That's what happened.

For the almost-nothing-it's-worth,
I believe you.

But you've been seen stalking
this guy for some time.

It was my job to follow him.

She hired me to follow him.

Let me play D.A. here.

I'm thinking that maybe you got
caught up with your target.

Got involved with him,
obsessed on him.

It happens.

A picture.

Travis...

Travis wanted me
to see that picture.

Why did he want me...
Ask Travis.

Travis? Travis Monroe?

Yeah. He had a picture.

Jesus, Derian,
I thought you knew.

Knew what?

Travis was killed
the other night.

What? Yeah.

Looks like some
random nut thing.

We found his body stuffed in a
dumpster behind his building.

Jeff,

I want you to go
to my apartment.

On the table, when you
first walk in the door,

there's a picture.

I want you to bring it to me.

I want you to go to my office,

get every single thing in the
Farrow-Smith file. All right?

Bring me everything
that's in it.

That was not a random thing.

That was not a random thing.

He's not dead, Falco.

Who's not dead?

Michael Farrow-Smith.

They were both setting me
up from the beginning.

They're in this together.

Hey, wait a minute. You're
going to have to start

a little slower, okay?

Listen to me.

Michael's about to go down hard
on money laundering, right?

The Feds are this close to getting him.
If they don't, the mob will.

He needs the ultimate out.

So you're telling me
he faked his own death?

Doesn't it solve
a lot of his problems?

He's got a tailor-made
suspect. He's got me.

Okay, so what about the stiff?

You know, the one with the Michael
Farrow-Smith toe tag on it.

I think it's this guy.

We trailed Anthea to his place.

Look at his shoulder.

Unless I'm wrong, this is the same
guy that broke into my place.

He was trying to make
sure that I didn't have

any evidence that
would unravel their plan.

So who is he?

I don't know.

Some guy they hired to do
whatever they needed done

until they didn't
need him anymore.

So they blew off his face
to make him pass for Michael?

I think it's possible.

It was not Michael's watch
on the body I saw.

Did you run prints on the body?

His hands were blown off,
defensive gesture.

Falco, I know I stuck that guy

who broke into my place
with that Indonesian statue.

If this is the same guy,

he would have a puncture
wound in his left shoulder.

Would you look?
Would you check to see?

There might still be mahogany
traces in the shoulder.

Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll take this picture.

I'll run a forensic comparison

on this guy and the guy
in the morgue. Okay?

I'll even comb through the evidence room.
I'll do what I can.

Guard!

Well, Derian, I guess
this is your lucky day.

Okay, there you go.

Thank you. Thank you.

Hi. Do you have your ticket?

It's electronic. Alice Jones.

Okay, I'll just need
to see an ID.

Thanks.

Police business. Out of the way, please.
Step aside, please.

Mrs. Anthea Farrow-Smith?

Metropolitan Police, ma'am.
Can you step this way, please?

What's this about?

Material witness to a homicide.

Did this man book a flight?

No, sir, I'm sorry.

But there is a Herbert Jones
pre-checked with Mrs. Jones.

<i>He should be</i>
<i>on the plane already.</i>

Where's the guy
in the seat next to you?

I don't know.
No one else has boarded.

Damn.

Derian.

You look down,

see how you can use life
to your advantage.

I know you have no
reason to believe me,

but everything that
happened between us,

that was real.

It was so real you wind up
here, making your escape,

and I wind up with a murder
rap, looking at life in prison.

Once everything
was set in motion,

Jesus Christ,
I couldn't get out.

And I believed
everything you told me.

Derian, you were part of our plan
at the beginning, that's true.

But it was a simple plan.

It was never supposed to
go on this long.

Nobody was
supposed to get hurt.

What about that guy on the bed?

He was dead.

And what about Travis?

That was not my idea.

Just wound up that way?

Anthea hated watching me
fall in love with you.

But she wanted it
at the same time.

She knew the only way she could
have you was through me.

We let it go on too long.

The people we owed money to,

they started to figure out
what was going on.

Anthea got desperate.
She panicked.

But you didn't panic,
did you, Michael?

The cops picked up
Anthea at the airport.

How come you weren't with her?

I told you.

I wanted out of my marriage.

I want to be with you.

I don't believe
you were part of this.

I have $20,000
in this envelope,

and a numbered bank
account with $37 million.

We could be anyone we want.

We could start
a new life tomorrow.

If you mean that, then
turn yourself in, Michael.

Don't threaten me,
Derian. Don't.

If you don't, Michael,

I will.

I'm not going to jail.

I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life

in some fucking black hole.

Well, Derian,

it's like I said.

You have to do
what you have to do.

And so do I.

What are you going to do,
Derian, shoot me?

Come on, Derian.
Shoot me in the back.

Don't do this, Michael.

Come on. Shoot me in the back.

Come on, Derian.

Come on!

Come on!

God, Michael.
