All right, kitty cats.

You ready to carve
the pumpkins or what?

Hey, I was watching that.
Sorry.

He wasn't watching that.
You weren't watching that.

Yes, I was.

All right then,
what was it?

TIMMY: A monster movie.

Fine, I'll put it back on.

Hey, Miss Witch,
why don't you give
those fingers a rest

and go wash your face.

I will.
What time are my parents
coming home?

SARAH: Uh, I don't know.
1:00? Hopefully sooner.

I get to stay up
till one?

No, bedtime's at 11.

Stop eating all that candy.
You're gonna be up
until tomorrow morning.

SARAH: Very cute.

Your parents
owe me for this one.

You could slap him
if you want.
I won't tell.

Oh, really?
I'll keep that in mind.

What time is it?
Oh, it's 10:50.

All right, seriously,
pumpkin carving
in 10 minutes.

I wanna get this over with.

Yeah, come on, Timmy.
Get the hell up.

I'm not done
counting my candy, loser.

Can we just bury him
in the backyard

and tell my parents
we lost him trick-or-treating?

Hey, look what I got.

What is that?

It's a videotape.

Where did
you get that?

Fell out
of my bag.

Let me see it.

Who gave this to you?
I don't know.

You don't remember
who put it in your bag?

No.

It doesn't say anything.

Let's watch it.
Oh, absolutely not.

Why?

Why? Because God knows
what's on this, that's why.

Only one way
to find out.

Timmy, you're
not watching it.
Yes I am.

Timmy, stop being
such an asshole.

Hey! I said no.

It's my tape, I can do
what I want with it.

Yeah, well, I'm in charge
of you and you have
to listen to me.

Let your parents watch it.
If they say it's okay,
you can watch it tomorrow.

No. I wanna
watch it now.

No, you're
not watching it.

Fine.
Let's put it
to a vote.

I vote
we watch it
right now.

SARAH: Put it to a vote?

What is this?
The town hall?

Little traitor,
now you're on his side?

What? I just wanna see
what's on the tape.

Two against one.
We win, put it on.

Do you understand
this is creepy?

Some pervert
could have put it
in your bag.

Who knows what's on this?

It's probably
just a scary movie.

If it's that bad,
you can turn it off.
We won't tell our parents.

It can't be worse
than the stuff we see
on the Internet every day.

what do you watch
on the Internet?

You know what?
I don't wanna know.

Please.

We won't make you
carve the pumpkin.

Fine, but you have to go
in the other room.
Yes!

I need to see
what's on it first.
TIMMY: Yes!

Ugh, this is retarded.

TIMMY: Well, what is it?
Well, give me a second!

Anything?

I don't see anything.

Looks like you
got hosed, Timmy.

Oh, wait a minute.

What is it?

Uh, I don't know.

(METAL CLANKING)

(CLANKING CONTINUES)

This is stupid.
Come on.

Um, excuse me.
Who said the two of you
can come back in here?

(WOMAN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)


See? It's just
a scary movie.

Let's watch it.

<i>Wait for the gate agent</i>
<i>to give your</i>
<i>boarding announcement.</i>

<i>Check your monitors.</i>
<i>Thank you kindly.</i>

Fine, but if it
gets out of control,
I'm turning it off.

Yeah, yeah.

(WOMAN MAKING
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA)

(GIRL LAUGHING)

Oh, my God, that's great.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Um, girl...

Do you know what time
the train comes?

Uh, it should be about
10 minutes or so.

Uh, do you have
a cigarette?

No, sorry.

Yeah, thanks.

Well, happy Halloween.

I need a fucking cigarette.

Come on.


<i>Please stand by</i>
<i>for further information.</i>



Please stop.


What are you doing?

Let me go. Help!

Help!


(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Help! Help!

(BREATH SLOWING)

(PANICKED BREATHING)

(TRAIN APPROACHING)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Help! Somebody
help me, please!

Somebody answer me!

Please! (CRIES)

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Who's there?

Where am I?

What's happening?

Would someone
talk to me?

Please stop screaming.

What's happening to us?
This is where he keeps us.

There were three of us.
There was another girl.

What happened to her?

She was dragged down
into that tunnel.

They're pulling us down
by our chains one at a time.

Why are you two
just sitting there?

Why aren't you
trying to escape?

We've tried everything,
there's no way out.




Why is he keeping us here?

Why doesn't he just
kill us already?

Why are you
doing this?

Let us go! Please!

(WOMAN MAKING
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA)

Don't cry.

We're gonna die
down here.

Don't say that.

We're gonna get
out of here.

I don't wanna die.

Shut up! Just shut up!
SARA: Kristen!

I can't take it anymore.
I can't keep listening
to this.

She's just scared. Okay?

I'm sorry.
SARA: We all are.

I'm sorry.

We can't fall apart
on each other now.

We're all we've got.

What's your name?

Casey.

I'm Sara.

That's Kristen.

There has to be
a way out of here.

I told you,
there isn't.

Then we have to go
down into that tunnel.

What?
We can't just stay here.

Going into that
tunnel is suicide.

Oh, and staying
here isn't?

What do you know?
You didn't see what
happened to that girl.

We did. We watched her
getting dragged down
into that tunnel

and she was screaming
for her life,

and we were trying
to hold on to her

but he just... He pulled her
right out of her hands.

We're not strong enough.

There's three of us now.

If we go together,
we might have a chance.

We don't even know
how many of them
are down there.

What do you suppose we do?

The only thing
we can do is
just wait here

and hope that
somebody finds us.

She's right, Kristen.

There's no other way.

No, Sara. Please.

You know I'm right.

Don't listen to her.
She's dead already.

Don't go!

I'm sorry.

There's no other choice.

Don't leave me here alone!

He's gonna kill you.

Kristen, we have to,
we can't just wait here
to see who's gonna be...

(ALL SCREAMING)



Oh, my God.
It's got her.

Oh, my God.

Listen to me, Kristen,
we have to go now.

You hear me?
We have to go down there.

I can't,
I'm too scared.

I know you are
and so am I,

but right now
I'm thinking
about my family.

I'm gonna get out of here
and I'm gonna see them again

and everything's gonna be
like it was before.

I know you feel the same,

but we're never gonna see
them again if we don't try
to get out of here.

I can't stay here
anymore, Kristen.

I can't wait
here to die.

I just can't.

We're gonna make it.
Do you understand me?

We're gonna
be all right.

Just stay close
and be quiet.

(CHAINS CLANKING)

This is where it ends.
Right, stay here.


Oh, God, look, look, look!
Use it on the chains.

I think it's big enough.

(CHAIN CLANKING)

I think it's working.







Oh, God!





Help me,
help me please.

There's something down there.
We have to get out of here.

Come on!


(CASEY SCREAMING)


(LIQUID BUBBLING)


No!

WOMAN: Please.

Please.

Please stop.

Please stop.

Don't hurt my baby.





(CASEY CRYING)



That was sick!

Okay, that is enough
for tonight.

TIMMY: Hey,
what're you doing?

SARAH: I'm turning it off.

It's too violent
for the two of you.

TIMMY: No, it's not.
We've seen way worse.

You're too young
to be watching a baby cut
out of someone's stomach.

SARAH: Come on, let's go.
It's bedtime.
Bedtime?

Yes, bedtime.
Tia, go wash your face.

I want the both of you
to brush your teeth.

Man, it was
just getting good.
Aw.

I know.
I liked the clown.

Yeah, he was great.
I liked when he honked
his horn at the lady.


Yeah, that was hysterical.

I'm gonna be up
to check on you guys
in 10 minutes.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

What is that
supposed to mean?

It's already been
quite an eventful evening.

<i>Why, what happened?</i>

Some creep slipped
a videotape into
Timmy's candy bag

<i>A videotape?</i>

Yeah, like a 1982 VHS.

<i>That's very twiste.</i>

<i>Oh, God. What did you</i>
<i>subject those kids to?</i>

I don't know,
it's this...

Fucked up short film
with a clown

and the devil
raping this woman.

<i>Sounds like my kinda mov.</i>

No, seriously, what
kind of sick bastard

puts that in
a kid's candy bag?

<i>Probably some loser</i>
<i>who still lives in</i>
<i>his parents' garag.</i>

Yeah, that's what
Timmy and Tia said.

(WATER RUNNING)
Move away.

I have to spit.

I was here first.
Get out!


No!

That's it.
Don't say
I didn't warn you.

Timmy, don't even!

Okay. (SPITS)

Timmy!

Hold on a minute, Dee.

What's going on up there?

TIA: Sarah,
Timmy spit in my hair!

TIMMY: It was an accident!

I'm reconsidering
having children
at this point.

<i>How did Barbara ever</i>
<i>talk you into this?</i>

What was I supposed
to say? No?

<i>You're a good friend.</i>

Yes, I am.

Speaking...

Speaking of good friends,

do you wanna meet me
for a drink after this?

<i>Yeah, I can totally do tha.</i>

All right, perfect.
I need one.

I'll text you
when I'm leaving.

<i>Cool.</i>
<i>Oh, and Sarah...</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

<i>Don't get killed.</i>

Funny.

<i>Bye.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>



(KIDS GIGGLING)

Little shit!

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(VEHICLE PASSING)

(METAL CLANKING)

All right, let's go.

Is my tape in there?

No.
Where is it?

Can I have it, please?


I don't know why you're
making such a big deal
out of this.

My parents are just
gonna give it to me
in the morning.

All right, then.
The faster you get
your little butt to bed

the faster you'll
get your tape.

You suck, Sarah.

Goodnight.

(DOOR CLOSES)

(HINGES CREAKING)

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

Lights out, kiddo.

All right.

Are you gonna tell
my parents that
Timmy spit in my hair?

Well, it depends.
Is he gonna
get in trouble?

Yeah.

Then absolutely.


Did you have
a good Halloween?
Yeah.

Did you get
enough candy?

I guess so.

You guess so?

Look at that bag, it looks
like you were trying to find
the golden ticket.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Do you think
that clown was real?

See? Ugh, I knew
this was gonna come
back to bite me.

No, it's just
make-believe.

Demons, witches,
monsters, that...
That doesn't exist.

But he wasn't
really a monster,
if you think about it,

like a vampire
or a werewolf.

He was just a man
in a costume.

Someone like that
could really exist,
right?

Like a serial killer,
I mean.

What do you know
about serial killers?

See, you watch so much
stuff on that computer.

It's gonna
rot your brain.

I sound like
my grandmother.

Listen to me,
the clown's only on
the video, right?

So if you don't watch it,
he can't hurt you.

And even if he could,
I wouldn't let him.

You swear?
I cross my heart.

Okay.

Time to go to bed.

Wait, Sarah.

Do you want me
to leave it on?

All right, sweetie.

If you need me,
I'll be downstairs.

Okay.
Okay. Sweet dreams.

Goodnight.
Goodnight, sweetie.

Sleep tight.

(DOOR CREAKS)

Timmy?

What do you want?

Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

Are you serious?
Why?

The clown scared you,
didn't he?

I thought he was so funny.

Fine.

Don't hog all
the blankets,
all right?

It's my bed,
I'll hog them
if I want.

<i>First eyewitness accounts</i>
<i>of this grizzly development</i>

<i>understandably frightene,</i>

<i>almost incoherent.</i>

<i>Officials and newsman</i>

You know what we
saw on our property
this afternoon?

MARY:  <i>What?</i>

A deer.
<i>Get out of here!</i>

I'm not kidding.
It was only ten feet away

<i>Oh, that's so cute!</i>

I know, isn't it?

<i>That is a sign.</i>
<i>Deer symbolize peace</i>

<i>I think things are</i>
<i>really gonna work out</i>
<i>great for you guys.</i>

God, I hope so.

You know, the hardest part
is just gonna be adjusting
to this new lifestyle.

not hearing an ambulance
or a bus every two minutes.

I'm standing by my window,
you know what I hear

outside right now?
Listen...

You hear that?
<i>No, what is it?</i>

It's nothing.
It's absolutely nothing.

You could hear a pin drop,
that's how quiet
it is here.

You know what 8:00
in the city sounds like?

<i>Like stress?</i>

Exactly.

And at least here
I can just clear my head

and John can focus
on his work.

<i>How is John,</i>
<i>by the way?</i>

He has his first
exhibition coming up
in a couple of weeks,

<i>I'm gonna have to</i>
<i>get my hands on</i>
<i>one of his paintings</i>

Ugh, I wish you'd buy
his latest painting

so I can get it
the hell out of this house.

Thing gives me the creeps.

<i>What is it?</i>

It's a face.

Just a horrible face.

Honestly, I just...

I can't even be
in the same room
as this thing.

<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>John painted</i>
<i>things like that.</i>

He doesn't.

According to him,
he doesn't even
remember painting it.

<i>He doesn't</i>
<i>remember painting it?</i>

No, he swears he was
in some sort of trance
or something.

And all he remembers
is waking up from this
terrible nightmare

with this image
in his head.

And the next morning,
there's this painting
in the living room.

<i>That's really strange.</i>

Yeah, well, you know
how artists are.

and I still can't figure out
how his mind works.

The owner of the gallery
thinks that it's gonna be
one of his best sellers.

<i>Well, I hope everything</i>
<i>works out for you guys.</i>

<i>I'm really looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing the house.</i>

maybe you and Bob
could come up
for a weekend.

<i>Bye.</i>
<i>All right, bye.</i>

Tia, Timmy,
I told the both of you
to go to bed.

Don't pretend
like you're sleeping.

I told you
to go to bed.

We are in bed.

So it must have been someone
else's little mischievous feet
running up the stairs.

What are you
doing in here?

She had a nightmare.

I didn't have a nightmare.
I heard a noise.

You heard a noise?

What kind of noise?

I don't know.

You can't describe
the noise?

Well, where did it come from?

TIA: My closet.

Your closet?

Yes, she does.
This happens all the time.

Shut up, Timmy.
It was real.

There was
someone in there.

Maybe it's the clown.

Timmy, stop it.

Shh, listen.
I think I just
heard his horn.

Stop it.

He's gonna drug you
and take you to the witches.

Timmy, knock it off.

Tia, listen to me,
we talked about this before.

There's nothing
in your closet,
not a clown, not anyone.

I want the both of you
to go to bed.

Maybe we could if you'd
stop checking in on us
every five minutes.

What are you

Just go to bed.
