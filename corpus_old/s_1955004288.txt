With Brudy and now with you.

This is the administrator hut
for a larger property.

Have you heard of the pine Hills?
Fir Hills.

Yes, the name sounds familiar.

Evan Tannehill is
been a long time senator.

Yes exactly. Of course.

And that was his refuge.

But now it's the
Hut of the administrator.

Correct.

The property is a
half a mile from here.

Which means you are ...
I am the administrator of your evening.

Let's call it re-orientation.

Ah, fits to what

With Claire I was almost engaged.

And to drag here

opposite me and Mom.

This is the small family-multiplication tables.

And even someone who is so selfish

This is a tradition in the pine Hills.

Being in politics is also a
Tannehill tradition. Is it true, Ben?

Ben has told you about his plans,
to be the next Tannehill Governor?

Not if Jared is faster.

Why is that funny?

Well, you're a stockbroker.

And?

Because stockbrokers are not politicians.

Should they perhaps.

To follow his heart,
is the most important.

What are you doing there?

I'm sorry. It lay there ...

Because you thought you read the times?

That's really good.
But that's private.

You like it?
I've read a few lines, but

you notice immediately that it is good.

Ben, you're talented genuine.

Thank you.

Yes, that is expected of me.

But you do not want.

The fir Hills are

The judges are or senators or ...
Stockbrokers?

Jared may be a stockbroker. Not me.

The burden of the firstborn.

Sound ridiculous to you.

Not really ridiculous.
Rather overwhelming.

Is still your life, Ben.

Not your father. If you are a
Want to be a writer,

then you should be a writer.
Easy to say,

Jared has probably at my
Gingerbread house offered something too much.

Oh really?

How was the storytelling?

Ben makes it wonderful.

Ben is a born storyteller.
Yes, I remember.

Are you writing still
these little short stories?

Short stories?

Yes, as Ben and I were together,

because it has pretty small
Stories written.

And then he said that he
times would be a writer.

Really?
Claire.

Sorry. I'll get it shortly.

Hey!
Did the stain out anything?

The patch is out!

Thank-you! Again one less worry.

No!

No no no! We

Normally it is not spontaneous,
but because Jared and Claire ...

The charade has to stop.

Oh no. No no no.

Also remember Maggie. They
is quite fond of you.

Really?

Yeah, me too of her.

You know, all are much nicer,
as I've imagined.

You said you know nothing about

That's right. Yes, just as it was.

Something you conceal me.

The same could I

What do you mean?
The letters.

But I thought it would be more appropriate
only the managers to stay.

Evan was like a brother.

They tell nothing about it.

Never.

Tell Ben and me
Chance to solve this problem alone.

We will make it.
Fast!

Quick.
All right.

All I want, Miss
Kanenablesteinsky is that ...

Keep in mind the consequences,

on feelings show consideration.

Good.

Hey.
Hey.

I'm sorry about earlier. I
wanted because of your writing

no problems between
your mom and you produce.

Did not you.
Good.

Really, that's the
last thing I want.

Ben, you have a moment?

Yes.

I do not know how that happened.

He's like a mixture of
Butler Carson and Obi Wan Kenobi.

He questioned me and
I confessed everything.

As in the finale of a
Law-and-order sequence or so.

You told him everything?
Yes.

Then I have to talk about it with my mom.
Oh no. Do not you have to.

Peters has promised that
He will not tell her anything.

How did you attempt it?

I have my methods.

But now everything's cool and apologize,
that I can squeeze myself.

Is okay.

When Jared and I had earlier dispute,

Mom Peters has commissioned,
find out the real reason.

Not your dad?

No. He was always at work.

Did he ever your
Read short stories?

No.

I've never shown it.

Are you sure?
Not at all.

Do not stop you.

Are you enjoying your undercover life
among the rich and famous?

They're not the way I thought
hab. Of course, they are rich,

but they are also nice.

I beg your pardon?

Wait a minute short.

Okay, continue.

Did you just using the word "nice" the
Characterizes object of your investigation?

Yes I have.

And I feel now
even guilty. And nasty.

Do I need a SWAT team
Send to ensure that you get out there?

I am serious. American
Adel, but I find the all super.

So, no wild orgies?

No. Pastries and Football.

And not because of PR,
but for the most deprived.

That we can participate in our
Not use newspaper.

You're right. That's just sweet.

Because somewhere a hook must be.

Usually already.

We listen to.

Hey!
Hey!

Your car is now
fully fueled and repaired.

Ah, you're great. Thank you.

Or should I prefer you not
Give getaway car while you are reading?

What?

No.

I just want to know whether the two
come together after all these years.

Is this...

too cheesy?

Ben, that's really good.

One does not expect a guy like you
good love stories are written, but ...

Ben, you're really talented.

And it would be a shame,
if you throw away the,

just about any
To meet expectations.
Had I the
Christmas Ball mentioned?

Christmas ... No, you did not.

There is a Christmas ball.

When?
Today.

What?
It's really not a big deal.

It's Moms Charity Ball.

I think that's a mega big deal!

Yes, you are right.

But I did nothing to put on.

Precisely.

This is perhaps
somewhat presumptuous, but ...

when I was just now in the city, have
I a little bit shopped for you.

Nothing special. Only a few clothes.

Available in various sizes.

And shoes.

Also available in different sizes.

Ben.

What you do not like, can
you bring back, that's okay.

That's the least I can do,
after what you've done for me.

You are the one that is here great, Greta.

Thank you.

You look gorgeous!

Thank you.

Ben, we go!

Sorry. Ll be right there.

You look amazing.

You too.

May I?

Thank-you.

Let's drink something.

I'll be right back.

Her dress is really stunning.

But you must also
not just hide. - Thank you.

Here's someone breathtaking.

Why do not you ask them?

No no no.
Do you think she does not want to dance?

I can not...
With her friend from his youth?

Well, when you put it like this, then ...

no longer it sounds
so terrifying.

Is my tie?

Nothing to complain about.

They have a Christmas school?

Yes indeed. Between
Roxburgh and Wooden Elms.

Wooden Elms. Really interesting.

I have to go.

You!
Yes I!

Stalkst you about me?

No, I Stalke my story.

Which story? No one is engaged.

Jared Tannehill drags his ex
Brother as his new girlfriend to?

Come on. That's a story.
Yes, an old.

Inform you, Wes.

This is not your color.

Everything okay with you?

But already! I believe,
I've lost something.

But how do you do that?
Very good. Thanks for asking.

Nice. Who is the man with
the lady has spoken degrees?

Oh, the little man with the
Mustache? A reporter.

I think he is
Reporter. From "Gossip Pulse".

He sneaks around here and asking questions.

Thank you.

Hey! Greta.

Who is the man with whom you grade yourself
hast entertained? Apparently, you know each other.

A guy who after
Men's room has been looking for.

You may think, just because you Ben
did you ever sit in the front row.

But that's just your
temporary space.

You have to know.

Excuse me.

Now just relax some games.

Yes.
Very loose. I do not bite already.

Now already say what you
ask me wanted.

What exactly do you know about Greta
Kanee as always, also called.

What makes you think that?

Only from curiosity.

That does not concern you, Claire.

I do think that
what that concerns me.

Your family is important to me, Ben.

I've missed you.

And I did not know how much,
until I had seen you again.

Sorry.

Can I borrow my girlfriend?

Sure, of course.

Maestro!

Claire.

You're the most amazing woman,
I've ever met.

You're beautiful, and you're smart.

You're the woman all night
a gingerbread house for children bakes.

And I know that maybe for
some may come somewhat surprising.

But not for me.

Claire Palmer Sinclaire.

Would you honor me the
prove to be my wife?

Yes.

Everything okay?

Dance with me.

It still hurts, right?

Not really.

Why did you separate then?

After we had come together, stand
my name suddenly in the tabloids

like never before.

Also no more after separation.

Then my father died and ...

the paparazzi rushed as the
Geier published on us and

every private detail.

I knew it.

She just used me.

She has used the family,
order to celebrate as a celebrity.

Bad if you do not
know who you can trust.

Crazy, I trust you.

Ben ... - I know, I know
you do not ...

But why should I not be trusted,

so if you do something crazy,
to help someone else.

What?

You said it yourself.

At Christmas we land
eventually under the mistletoe.

Ben!

I'm sorry...

Greta!

Hey.

Hello There.

Can I?
Sure, sit down.

Is it warm enough?
Yes, I think so.

Did you enjoy the evening?
Yes very. And them?

On the whole, so, yes.

It was nice to finally
to laugh and dance.

It's Ben particularly important
that you can enjoy Christmas.

You is very much about him, yes?

He is a wonderful person.

He is not so,
as I've expected.

Why expect?

Well, when I met him.

I mean, now I expect
Of course just wonderful.

And that Claire is here?
Come cope with it?

Would I have to say,
but it is unusual.

This is still expressed softly.

Both sons are the same
Been wife.

And one engaged for today.

This is again a feast for the press.

Perhaps will not be as bad.

Not in this day and age with the
Kardashians and the rest of them.

But in contrast to those want
we no publicity.

This makes us all the more to the target.

It can be.

But maybe you're right.

Probably what you need yet
Deftigeres to attract attention.

Like the fact that Claire earlier
has times angebaggert my husband.

What? Not seriously!

Oh but.

Well, that was years before
she and Ben were a pair.

How did you find out?

I've seen them.

And saw how Evan
dismissed and brought to the door.

Goodbye forever
I've thought back then.

Well, that's ...
Is hearty.

Yes.

God, how can you just stand,
under the same roof with her ...

Especially when...

I think that things
always develop as they should.

Okay, go!
You have something?

I sent it Charlie.
My friend at Warner Books.

Without a word to Ben?

I've used a different name.
I just want some feedback from the expert.

I thought that if Charlie
Ben says that it is good,

then motivates him that perhaps that
Writing to pursue serious.

You lose when all your cheating
someday the overview.

Do a Flowchart.
Is really bad, right?

Not in our industry.

That makes it somehow worse.

Wait a moment.

This is Doria.

I should at least one
Create half-truth from the world.

Good luck, Boss. Let me know,
if I have to call the ambulance.

Doria!

Is a football game.

Minnesota to Oklahoma.

We can switch if you ...
Oh no. I love football.

Mag bacon and loves football.

Who are you?

How did you sleep?

Quite well.

And you?
Quite well.

Have your snoring missing.

Did yours also missing.

I do not snore yet!
Yes, you do.

No, I do not. You're snoring!

Did you like this about not been said?
As a truck driver.

Hi.

Hi.

You are so Beautiful.

I have to say what, Ben you.

It's really important.

Now you cut me, you two.

I'll quite red.

I know, otherwise there's other
Knabberkram for Football, but ...

That cost me a lot of money.
This has probably.

And there is something to eat,
no work of art, so ...

Here.
Thank-you.

Maybe it's art.

That was a piece of my Veneer.

I think that was two
Months in the shop window.

Oh, you eat the house already?
No!

Is my Veneer okay?

How should I know that?
Watch for times.

Show me.

I guess so.

Ho, the game!

OK honey. I do not know,
What did you put there,

but it tastes like ne beltway.

Please listen to me.

There is important news,
I have to tell you.

It gives me no joy,
To be the bearer of such messages.

But you were all lied to.

That woman is a spy.

You mean, she works for the CIA?

No, not like ne
real spy-spy.

She's a reporter.

For "Gossip Pulse".

She's with us
crept to spy on us

and to write a Tannehill story.

That is quite a charge.
She has

on the children's festival and on the
Ball entertain with the same man.

I discovered,
that the man was a reporter

and myself have done a little research.

And I found out,
that Greta Kane ...

in truth is a gossip reporter.

Yes, but she is the girlfriend of Ben.

Ben, please. I can...
No. She's not my girlfriend.

Please, I just wanted to ...

This was all just a lie.

Our first encounter,
your stay here,

everything played.

All because you my ex-girlfriend
anschleppst here without warning.

I tried to call.

Your car and all that ...

The Snow Bride on the run,
that was all just made up?

The car has really pinned.

I thought you help me
because you're a good person.

You wanted you only gain access.

Easy...

What Claire says is true.

I am a reporter.

And I should write a story.

Because there was a tip that one of the
Brothers bought an engagement ring.

Now that is also
a story about me.

How could you hurt me so?

I should be all
find out what I could.

And what did you find out?

That you are a family.
A wonderful family.

And I hired conjectures
have, just because of prejudice.

I was wrong.

I am so sorry. It
I'm so terribly sorry.

But I make sure that no
Story will be released upon you.

Not from me.

You've got your car keys.

You can go now.

Excuse me.

Sorry.

Greta!

Just a sec.

You'd almost forgotten.

Thank you.

Drive carefully, okay?

This is Kevin's family
not further notice.

It has no sleeves!
But the stain is out.

Do you hate me?

Honestly?

I think it looks great!

Who wants to have puffed sleeves?
Good.

But what is more important:

this dress, this love tradition,
brought you to your dream man.

Oh, the thinks I had lied to him
and will never speak to me again.

At least you're not a drama out of it.

Say honestly, how do you feel?

Guilt, shame, inconsolable ...

But maybe that means ...
Depressed, terribly angry ...

I understand that totally.
Lonely,

sad, frustrated ...

Wistful, nervous public.

Now repeat do not permanently.

Have you tried calling him?
No.

Or tried to reach him otherwise?

What do I mean?
Even more humiliating?

Maybe he missed you
exactly as you miss him.

His phone works.
And he did not call me.

Does not sound like
he'd miss me.

Do not be mad at me, Ben.

I had the truth
find out about Greta,

because I still
Have feelings for you.

I have done everything for love.

I love you, Ben.

Love?

Yes love.

Are we completely interchangeable for you?

You're engaged to my brother.

Yes, but that was, that was a mistake.
I should never have to say "Yes".

I was in a panic.

Ben, you're there. You
are there always has been.

Just because my father
did not want to play.

And to be clear, Claire,

I also do not play with.

Please go. Immediately.

For I am Jared now
Tell the truth. The whole truth.

And when I did that,

then is your last chance,
to be a Tannehill past.

Forever.

Seriously?

You can not
simply run away from me.

We have been through so much together.

And I have yet so much done for you!

But that's the problem.

I hate you!

You said degree, you love me.

And you're my brother
engaged. So what now?

That's a good question.

Oh, shut up!

You are together with me,
to obliterate him one.

I would never a
Stockbroker married.

I'll call a cab.

I would sooner what to say.

No, how did you should know

I fall in love with your ex
and then as a show depart.

It is not your fault.

We never find in life.

Keep looking.

Do you remember when we were little,
We were looking for reindeer tracks.

Yes. And when we had found that,

... That was real Christmas magic.

Could we use now.

In any case.

You are welcome.

What are you doing there?

Diamonds in the snow looking.

That's romantic.

This just came for you.

Sender: "Doria Dress."

Say that again.

I provide no
Information about the fir Hills.

That's why you went there since.
I know.

You shoot your
Transport in the wind,

because you do not have some spoiled,
rich celebrity politicians want to report?

So they are not, Lou.
They are really quite nice.

I do not know.

And you wanted something
earlier also do not know.

But now.

Listen.

I know Maggie Tannehill
for over 40 years.

If I say, the family is
Fair game, then it's fair game.

Come on, Lou, why
is that so important to you?

Jared Tannehill wants
married, who cares?

That's really not a good story.

Is it when the same woman
the brother and the father together.

She had nothing to do with the father.

A detail.
But an important one!

Now he can not
fight more against it, right?

And this story is an instant
bombastic online Start grant.

That's a lie and
violates the privacy.

If you pull through this, I quit.

And if you do not
by draw, then I fire you.

It's your decision.

Do you already know what you want to do?

No Idea.

But from the
Tabloids I've enough.

Wherever you land, you must
then please bring me to you.

For the duplicate content.

If you are already a celebrity
verfällst, then that was the right one.

Yes. But the thinking now, I'm the
Source and will hate me even more.

But who is the source?

The Lord, you can tell everything.
I am anxious to hear your stories.

Of course.
What do you want to do now?

The only thing I can.

What do you want here?

Please give me five minutes.
I gave you enough.

It is because of Claire.

I do not know one hundred percent,
what they are writing,

But Senator Tannehill is
not good to get away under warranty.

You have no evidence.
You do not need.

Well, let's threaten halt
by legal means.

That would come too late.

Lou Blanco?

I connect with Maggie Tannehill.

Hey, Lou!

Yes, it's insanely long ago.

Of course I remember.
I remember everything!

Listen, Lou, I
got great news.

It's been a few days,

because I have my lawyers
commissioned purchasing

of "Pulse Gossip"
to lead in the way.

And our common
Girlfriend Greta Kane

raves in the highest
Tones of you and your team.

I beg your pardon?

She no longer works for Pulse?

We need to retrieve quickly.

I have quite a few ideas on how we
can put it in the company.

Oh, because I still think of one thing.

If my information is correct,

is you a story right to the
Claire Sinclaire has contributed something?

This is not yet in
both our interests.

Do not you think so? Good.

I'll see you soon, Lou.

Peters had a bit of
I researched about you,

After they arrived here.

So you have ...
Just know who you are.

Quasi from the outset.

Why did not you tell?

We were curious, while the
everything would develop, right?

Very curious.

I've decided,
To take precautions

so no gossip story
published about us.

So you buy really
a tabloid?

Yes, obviously.

Although a small change of direction
is planned to seriöserem journalism.

You have me consciously
tells what Claire has done.

If you had tried to
For releasing information

I had known that we
You can not be trusted.

If not, does that mean
we can trust you.

You said you believe the things
develop as they should.

I do.

But if necessary, get things
by me a little push.

Greta, you want to
with us for dinner?

Thanks, but I prefer to go.

I hope you do not hate me for it.

Greta has my novel
sent to a publisher.

Under an assumed name.

Does he like them?
You've written a novel?

You want me on
talk a contract.

Congratulations!

That means now so that you
will not go into politics?

It is, in any case, that
I have to think about a lot.

Such as the name.

Tannehill would be very good
make on a book cover.

You know what I mean.

This is your dream, right?
To be a writer?

Yes, it is.

Then follow him!

For sure?
I've never been so sure.

And never so proud.

So, another issue: What is
now with you and Greta?

Oh, Mom. She's ne gossip reporter.

I was just their story.

If you're just their story,
would have published them.

But if she has not.

Hi.

Hi.

How come you're here?

Very strange ...

A few days ago came the invitation.

With a map of "Doria Dress".

She did not.
Yes, she has.

One has to say: Looks much
better than last time.

Full of dirt and snow.

And then your ridiculous
Bride-to-the-flight history.

Almost Bride.

I was on the hunt for a story.

And, Miss Kane,
They apparently found.

What is missing is the end.

It strikes me as a thing.

Oh yes?

Oh yeah.
