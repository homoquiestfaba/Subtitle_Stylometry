They cut out my tongue.

[suspenseful music]

No I don't wanna do this

[screaming indistinct]

please don't do this to me...

How are you adjusting?

I don't know no one will
tell me what's going on.

We're fucking lab rats
that's what's going on.

Lab rats for what?

It's some kind of a program.

We have to find a way out.

There's no way out.

You understand the people right
in this place are twisted,

you have no idea what they're
capable of.

I can't just sit here and do
nothing

my family doesn't even know
where I am.

Look the only way to
get by this facility

is to lay low and learn
to live with the routine

we'll be out of here in three
months tops.

How do that?

Hellenbach told me.

And you believe him?


What did they do to him?

You don't wanna know.

[suspenseful music]

What did they do to you?

They ball me


Stand back please.

What is that?

Healing serum.

Healing serum?

He shouldn't be back to
his regular selfie on time.

Why do they do this to him?

He did this to himself.

I don't know what the fuck
is going on in this place,

but we have to find a way out.

I told you there is no way
out.

I'm looking for an exit are
you coming with me or not?

Look don't make any waves okay

if you just submit your
treatments

and just make your.

I'm not submitting to any
treatments,

[door shut]

[clock ticking]


What are you doing?

I.

I told you not Sharyn didn't I
Sharyn?

Follow me

please Sharyn seat

[suspenseful music]

Where did she get these
pictures?

What can you tell me about
this man?

If I tell you about
him can I call my family?

His name was Nico.

He was a piano tuner

we lived together for a few
months,

but we were bad for each other.

How did this relationship end?

He decided not to stick
around.

He committed suicide?

I don't know why he did it.

I was told later by police
that he had 10 pounds of heroin

in his piano.

And you were unaware
that he was trafficking?

Yes.

And that's all you
can tell me about him.

Yes.

That's all.

That's all.

The phone now

we had a deal.

You're not in any position
to be bargain Sharyn.

Why are you doing this?

I'm trying to help you.

Oh you're trying to help me.

It's very clear that you're
not ready.

Ready for what?

Please Sharyn it's best
you head back to your room.

[breathing heavily]


â™ª Believer â™ª

â™ª Lucky you â™ª

[upbeat music]

[door shut]

[door shut]

[door shut]

[foot step]

[breathing heavily]

Where you going?

I was just looking for my
room.

Please.

I promise I will stay in my room
please


let go back to my room.


How does that feel Sharyn?

Twinkle your toes please

my my very good.

How is even that even
possible?

The serum behind you,

we call it B M S

I don't know why you
would cut off my leg

just to heal me.

All that's how things work
here Sharyn,

How you work here?

You guys are just statistic
fucks.

I'm not sadistic

I help people with Sharyn I ease
suffering

unlike you it's people
like you who cause it.

People like me?

I told you not to roam didn't
I?

Your leg should be fine in no
time.


Are you Sharyn Berkley?

Yes.

I am detective Costa Aetos,

I'd like to ask you a few
questions if you don't mind.

Sure.

You try to escape.

Yeah it's weird I can
already feel my toes.

How did you get here?

I mean to the facility?

From another hospital
like everybody else,

I think they're harvesting test
subjects.

Who is they?

The military if they this in
the field,

they're gonna have an
army of immortal soldiers.

I see.

Oh.

Careful.

Where are you going?

I thought we were gonna you know
talk.

Maybe later.

I told you escape was a bad
idea

those people are monsters.

I just saw my ex-boyfriend

he's been dead for 10 years.

10 years.

He's been dead for 10 years.

You're 100% sure you saw the
body.

Yeah he hung himself.

At a funeral like when they
took him from the hospital

or the morgue or whatever.

Oh.

At the funeral you saw his
dead body.

It was a closed casket.

[suspenseful music]

Three months you told me three
months.

I told you I would review
your case in three months,

the final determined.

Don't give me that shit
I know there are people

that have been here for 10
years.

Please calm down or
you show me whatever,

I do have nothing to worry
about.

I deserve to know when I'm
going home.

That's not my decision.

Who is it?

I wanna talk to management.

That's not gonna happen.

I want to talk to
management right the fuck now.

Please Everett you must.

Now.

All right,

come with me,

please.

Look I'm sorry about
getting upset before

I just think I deserve to
know about my release date.

Of course this of course
I've I completely understand.

Told me how in the
street and that'll be that

you'll never hear from me again

I'm an expert at keeping my
mouth shut.

Of course you are.

Especially when it
comes to illegal stuff.

Wait Hellenbach no please
Hellenbach no I take it all back

I didn't mean any of that
Hellenbach...



What do about his piano tuning
business?

Nothing really.

We found 10 pounds of heroin

inside the piano next to his
body

do where the piano came from?

No I don't.

Do who delivered the piano?

No.

Do you know who the piano was
meant for?

Do where the piano was supposed
to go?

No I don't know anything
about the stupid piano

I don't know who it was for

I don't know where it was going

and I didn't know there were
drugs inside.

[suspenseful music]

[playing piano]


[suspenseful music]



[breathing out heavily]

Just relax Sharyn breath

Oh my God.

I told you not to roam

what happened?

So What frightened Sharyn?

There was a piano and

And?

You saw a piano and?

Are you elucidating Sharyn?

I see what's going on here.

I think it's time we analyze

what's going on inside your
head.

There's nothing to analyze.

Miss. Berkley.

Nice place you got here.

Thank you I grew up
here it was my mom's.

As the investigation closed.

We found no evidence of foul
play in determined his death

to be a suicide.

I know what it's like to
lose someone it's not easy.

You lost someone you were
close with

My little brother he
also took his own life.

I took him to a shooting
range for his birthday

he went to learn how to shoot

or at least that's what he told
me.

It was fine for a while,

but then it started getting
cold.

He asked me to go grab
his jacket from the car,

and by the time I went
back he shot himself.

That's terrible.

How do you deal with something
like that?

I started going to church I
go every time I think of him,

I just sit there with myself

it does it take long
for me to feel better?

It sounds nice.

Maybe you should try.

[knocking door]

May I?

How long have you been here?

I don't know nobody knows.

No clocks no windows so
it's always nighttime.

So how they get in your head?

I never stop.

Can they make you see things

and feel things that aren't
there?

Yeah absolutely they're very
good.

You said they burned you
alive?

Yeah three times they put in
oven

first My skin blisters,

when my blisters start to burst

then my eyes start boiling,

I can't see,

but I can still feel and smell

you know the stench of
your own flesh cooking

is something you never forget.

Do you ever think about
escaping?

Are you fucking kidding me?

I have some ideas I think
we can get out of here,

Sharyn why don't I help
you back to your room

Indexing is about to begin.

Let me give an hand.

Guess that leg isn't a hundred
percent.

Give it time Sharyn.

Dr. Hellenbach the patient

roam it's not good for you.

[door knocking]

[keys jingles]

Hellenbach keys.

Come on.

There's No phone there's no
computer,

how did they get anything
done in this place?

Well they keep all these
papers on file

It makes things easier to burn.

If this thing get out of
the opening which it works,

the government can't
just shove it on the rug.

There's nothing here there's
nothing.

Hey do you happen to know
Latin?

Wait,

What is this?

delivery guy.

The exit.

Don't worry about it Doc.

We need one DMS bank for the
patient in the room at eight.

[hymn music]

How does being here help you?

It makes me feel closer to my
brother.

How do you mean?

Just a feeling,

I feel him next to me.

Do you think he's out there
somewhere?

I think he is

he asked me

Do you think he would
want you to blame yourself?

I'm not blaming myself.

You're seeking forgiveness.

The only person who can
forgive you it'd you.


Thank you

Don't sweet it.

What are you doing?

Looking for you.

Why?

You wanna get out of here
right?

Yeah.

That makes two of us.

[alarm ringing]

[keys jingle]


[foot step]

Fugitive escaping North side.

[breath heavily]

Triple nine where are you?

Triple nine do you copy triple
nine.


bitch you know that?

so what does that say about you?


because I married a goddamn
bitch.


now I am leaving I'm tired
of this conversations.

even to see you again...

again...

Help I need some help hello.

Hello.

Is anybody home?

Hello.

[breathing heavily]

No please don't.


something amazing

about this trust, it fulfills
its own expectations

let's talk more about your past.

Why do you keep healing me?

I don't you just kill me?

people here.

So let's talk about the worst

that you think you've ever
done in your life Sharyn.

I was a drug addict.

all about that what else?

There's nothing else.

It's always good to tell the
truth,

unless of course you weren't
exceptionally good liar,

which you are not.

But what were you going to
school for?

I was majoring in English.

English what do you want
to be an English teacher?

No I wanna work in
publishing I'm a journalist.

You could give me the
scoop on some good stories.

Trust me you don't wanna
write about the story

that I deal with unless you
like living without sleep.

It's that bad then why do you
do it?

It's not bad it's just that

there's more to life than work,

I wonder what's everyone else
does.

Family, kids, all that.

Not everybody wants that.

How did you wind up here?

Car accident?

Was it serious?

It was pretty bad.

Broken ribs had neck injuries

and then I wound up here.

Did you ever do anything
that was really awful.

Why do you ask?

Because 10 years ago I did
something that was terrible

and I don't wanna talk about
it or tell you what it was,

but it was really bad

and it's drowning me,

and I think that's why I'm here.

What about you?

I'm not really sure I follow,

but I haven't done anything
to warrant this kind of abuse.

Really?

Absolutely not.

You know Everett we're in the
same boat

and I'm trying to steer us to
shore,

but you got to pick up the
slack.

[soft music]

You're not drinking what's
going on?

I'm pregnant.

You're pregnant.

Well that's great isn't it?

Before we go any further I
have to tell you something.

I thought you were dead.

They wanna keep burning me
alive,

the sad part is I deserve it.

Nobody deserves that.

A few weeks ago I
broke into a Mink farm,

there were 650 Minks

waiting to be slaughtered for
their fur,

and I couldn't let that happen

I needed to get them out,

but I couldn't just leave at
that

you know I need you to stop
the whole thing from happening,

so I burned it,

I burned the whole farm to the
ground,

the farmers were still
sleeping in the house

husband and wife

and they didn't make it out.

The thing is I knew they
were in there I knew it,

and I thought that they deserved
it

for killing all those beautiful
animals,

but then I realized it's me,

I'm the one that deserves it,

I just wish they would let me
die,

you only way out of here is
death.

Cassandra we're already dead.

What?

Before you got here you ate
poisonous mushrooms right?

And before I got here I
had emergency surgery,

before Everett got here he
was in a fatal car accident,

don't you see you, me, him

we're all dead

and I think this place is hell.

What did you do why are you
here?

10 years ago I killed my
ex-boyfriend,

we got high on some shit
he bought in Mexico,

and we got in a fight.



[soft music]

But you didn't mean to kill
him

it was an accident wasn't it?

That part was an accident

but what happened wasn't.

[suspenseful music]

why did you do that?

'Cause I panic I
couldn't think straight.

[soft music]

I want you to forget all
this I beg you forget it.

[suspenseful music]

I see you like to do some
light reading.

You've read Dante's Inferno.

Yes when I was in college,

ordered me to death,

but I do remember some things

like when Dante travels through
hell

how the centers are tortured

and then healed only to be
tortured again

sound familiar.

Very good most people
never figure it out.

Who are you?

Are you Satan?

There is no Satan.

I'm a patient to just like you.

What?

Everybody down here is Sharyn

I was a doctor not there

I enjoyed my power a little
too much off my patients,

I prescribed medicine opiates
primarily

myself when your boyfriend
actually have a lot in common,

except that my drug dealings
were legal.

I had a lot of books with
the pharmaceutical companies,

I was way ahead of the
curve in that regard,

it was a nice life,

but people's guide overdoses and

it doesn't really matter
because I had no remorse at all,

actually I didn't realize

what kind of suffering
I did until I got here,

they punished me overdose after
overdose

they don't overdose me with
narcotics,

they overdose me with bile.


So doctors torture other
doctors?

That's the way the system
works

whoever comes down here is
evaluated

then after three months,

they're enrolled in the program
to begin to torture others.

But what if you don't want to
torture?

Well then you are
punished for it you see

hell is a self-perpetuating
system of cruelty.

How long have you been here?

Since 1969.

So you're some sort of
know it all kind of guy.

I guess you could say that.

Can a person die here?

Like a final absolute death.

Absolute death is absolution.

Hell is not about absolution.


No you don't have to do this.

What makes you think I don't
want to?

[breathing heavily]

Nico.


You love me once remember?

I loved you too.

Nobody loved you like I did

nobody

I'm the only one who puts
candles on your grave,

and I'm sorry I killed you

and I can't change it,

but I can pay for it

so hang me please

but don't let me down lock
the door and walk away

and let me rot.

It doesn't work that way.

Come on.

Where do you think you're
going?

This is a private matter.

When you come, come and get
me you know that.

This is none of your business.

Well actually it is my
business in all these years

I have never failed in
delivering a patient

and I will not start today.

am the reason she's here

I decide what happens to her.

Oh in that case maybe I
should talk to the people

that decide what happens to you

they will mow you down Nico,

they go they will peel off your
skin,

they will drink your blood

because I know how things
work done here Nico

so do you really want me to
complicate things for you?

You're full of shit Doc.


[hymn music]

[bell ringing]

[lighting and thunder]

Go.

It was nice seeing you.


[beep sounds]






[suspenseful music]



[bell ringing]

Go.

[suspenseful music]


[soft music]

How are we feeling?

Where am I?

Holy cross hospital
you been out for awhile.

Out?

We ran into some complications

we had to put you into
a medically induced coma

in order to clean out your
abdomen,

there was an infection
inside your heart stopped

we thought we lost.

I Died?

Clinically speaking yes you
were dead for about 15 seconds

It felt like a lot
longer than 15 seconds.

I wouldn't do that
just give it a few days

and you'll be back home,

you take care Sharyn.

Mom.

Hey we can't disturb mommy
she's been through a lot.

I love it.

I'm glad to have you back,

I'm glad to be back.

You look pretty damn good
for someone who is dead,

It's the miracle of modern
medicine.
