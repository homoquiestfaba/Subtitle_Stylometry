It really is, and this issue you have

is bringing attention.

I don't like attention.

We both know this shit

Listen, I didn't start this shit.

This shit fell in my lap.

I don't want these problems

no more than you want the problems.

What I gotta do, I have to finish this.

[speaking foreign language]

And this is one of the reasons why

we're having this conversation
instead of a different one.

What would be the different one?

Recent bullshit aside,

you have potential and
the boss wanna see you.

The boss?

All this time, you had me
thinking you was the boss.

Sha, everyone answers to somebody.

I agree.

Now come on, let's go.

Yo, my nigga.

Oh shit, what's up, my nigga?

Yo my nigga, I've been in the shop, man,

times looking for you.

Son, you know, let me tell you something

That shit is hot as a motherfucker.

Yo, listen, my nigga.

Like yo, man, I'm at the
crib counting the bag.

I look up at the fucking camera, my nigga.

Yo, these bitches is in my crib,

Slams the door, my nigga.

Yo, that shit's crazy, son.

Throw that shit on the floor.

Grab the fucking chopper, my nigga.

Yo, boy, my crib turned
into fucking Iraq, my nigga.

Yo, it's funny you should say that

about these bitches, son.

You know, a couple of months ago, man,

in the barbershop here, I'm cutting hair,

this chick roll up on me asking me

something about the gambling spot.

You know what we do in the back.

Yo son, let me tell you,

that night, I'm back
there rolling dice, man.

Lose all my money, go to
the back and said fuck it.

It is what it is.

All of a sudden, I'm hearing
gunshots in the back.

In the shop?

In the shop, son.
Wow.

So I cracked the hammer.

You know I keep that thing on me, right?

All right, all right.

I see some bitches running out.

I caught that last bitch.

You know, I laid her ass out.

As you should, my nigga.

You steamed the shit out that ho.

Now listen, I'ma tell you what it is, man.

Some bitch named Keisha

and she rolling with a
fucking bunch of dyke bitches.

Like, this is what them
bitches do, my nigga.

But it's kinda my fault.

I created this monster,
you know what I mean?

But yo son, I'm here if you need me.

Yo, keep your head to
the ground, my nigga.

All right?

Stay up. That's what's up.

[woman sighs]

they want any and all

information on those girls
linked to these homicides.

Mainly, they're interested
in a robbery that took place

in the full day

and an undetermined amount of cash

taken from that jewelry store.

They wanna see you in an hour.

Damn, so it's an
undetermined amount of cash.

From a jewelry store?

No tape, no jewelry taken?

They didn't take nothing.

Yeah, that's the feds.

I knew that was them.

Man, you already know.

Anderson!

Pleasure to meet you, Howard.

I've heard nothing but
good things about you.

Same to you, sir.

All right, all right.

Enough introductions.

Look, I need you guys to go out there,

get these bad guys, or rather girls.

Look, be safe.

I'll see you guys later.


I'm looking for Agent Smith.

How's it going?

I'm Agent Smith.

How you doing?

I'm Detective Howard.

This is my partner, Detective Anderson.

Boss man gave us orders to come down here

and help you with whatever you need.

All right, nice to have you aboard.

This is my squad over here.

How you doing?

Agent Lewis.

Turner.

Agent Cruise.

KB.

Yeah, so I mean, hopefully
this a two way street

and we'll get to put an end to all this.

What we got so far.

Our prime suspect is CoCo.

Hm? Nah, uh-uh.

Angel of Death.

Everywhere she go, death follows.

Really? Interesting.

What about the rest of them?

You guys know any of them?

I mean, I might have seen them,

but Keisha right here,

she attached to at least three
homicides I'm investigating.


Of course. Listen.

I'm in a meeting right now.

Let me get back to you.

Yeah, I got you.

All right, listen.

I'ma send you the address.

Yeah, I'ma cook us something
special tonight, all right?

I'll see you later.

Well our primary suspect is CoCo,

and we're certain that she
is the leader of the pack.

I saw all four of those girls together

while I was undercover at a pool party,

but I don't have any
names for the other girls.

So you guys been onto the group?

Not the group, just the individual.

So our plan is to be part of your team,

infiltrate the whole organization

and find out exactly who they work for.

Who they work for?

Yeah, from all the intel
that we've been getting,

we're finding out that this girl, Coco,

had to have somebody much
bigger in the picture.

Couldn't have done it by herself.

Any leads to her whereabouts?

KB has the leads.

It ain't much longer before he find out

everything we need to know.

We're gonna help you any way we can

and we expect the same in return.

That's what I like to hear.

So I suggest we go ahead

and pick up the homicide suspect

and start putting the
squeeze game in play.

That's what we do.

Put a little fear factor on these dudes,

you'll start getting all
the information you want.

All right.

Sounds like a plan.

All right, bet, let's get these bitches.

Let's get it.
All right.

Stop.

[machine whirring]

[geese honking]

[indistinct conversation]


So where we going?

You're not even talking?

I don't know where I'm going?

I guess I'm just rolling the dice, huh?

Either gonna be a head cracker or an ace.

Let's roll, baby.

[plane whirring]

[eerie music plays]

â™ª It is what it is by now â™ª

â™ª Ten toes down â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

â™ª It's cheaper to keep her â™ª

â™ª Why would I leave her â™ª

â™ª This ain't no rap shit â™ª

â™ª This is the diva â™ª

â™ª Thinking I'd keep her â™ª

â™ª We gotta speed up â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck with no snitch â™ª

â™ª I keep my distance â™ª

â™ª Flexing them bitches â™ª

â™ª You don't wanna hit this â™ª

â™ª We don't pretend â™ª

â™ª Catching a Tim â™ª

â™ª Money is spent â™ª

â™ª I got a gift â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

â™ª Don't fuck up the rear â™ª

He's with me.



Hold up, hold up, hold up.

[indistinct conversation]

Yo Po, you know this guy?


[rap song resumes]

What's up, mami?

What's up?

Sha, this Po.

What's up, my nigga?

What's going on with you, man?

How you doing?

Welcome to Miami, man. You good?

Yeah, I'm great.

That's what's up. This is my city, man.

Those Haitians, you know what I'm saying?

Everything good with you?

Everything great.

That's what's up, man.

You know, my girl Carmen, man,

she been sending me a lot of
great things about you, man.

That was a good job, Carmen.

It's kind of funny because this

is the first I've ever heard of you.

Yeah, well you know
what time it is though,

you know what I'm saying?

A nigga like me, man,

you gotta keep a low pro,

you know what I'm saying?

Like super low profile,

you know what I'm saying?

But yo, it's all good bro.

You're here now.

You're here with me, so I'm
gonna make it happen, man.

It was hard getting here.

I got searched about five times.

Thought I was coming to see the Pope.

Yo, like I said, man,

low profile is the key, brother.

You know what I'm saying?

Yeah.

Yeah, so, I'm sure she
filled you in already,

so let's get to the business.

This is how I'm gonna do this.

You buy 10 pieces, I send you 30.

I buy 10, you send me 30?

[Po] Yeah.
What's the catch?


Consistent.

What you think about that?

At the number I'm getting,

30 pieces every two weeks.


I mean, that's a little challenging,

that's hard.

I mean, I'm sure it's
not the 30 pieces, my dude.

That shit sells itself.

Is it the price?

At the end of the day, I think
you're a pretty smart dude.

[Sha speaks indistinctly]

[Po sighs]

You ain't talk to him?


Aight, man. I think it's the price.

This is what I'm about to do.

I'll take $5,000 off these bird.

What you think about that now?

If you can take five
grand off each bird.

Each bird.
We're in business.

That's what's up, brother.

Only problem now,

you have some problems
I've been hearing about.

I mean, it ain't nothing
for me and my niggas

to take care of, you know what I'm saying?

I got that taken care of.

You supply the food. I got that.

I like that.

I like that.

So we waiting on you then, man.

Sha, my man.

Let's go. Can I go now?

I mean, you could go now.

Okay.

[dramatic music begins]

Benny, I'm leaving.

All right, well, have a good night.

Who do you know?


Who do you know?

I'm going to start
doing whatever I want.

When I am satisfied, I'm
going to ask a question.

If I get the remote inclination
you are lying to me,

I'm going to make what I was doing before

look like fucking hand holding.

So, she talk?


[Vika laughs]

Vika!

[speaking Russian]

Don't kill her yet.

[Vika speaking Russian]

Go get my chair.

Okay, easy.

All I want to know is who did
you tell about duffel bag?

I don't know.

Okay, enough.

Enough of this.

If I have to get up from my chair,

I am going to cut your
fingers off one at a time.

Just tell me what I need to know.

I don't know.

[cashier grunts]

Just tell me what I need to know

and you can go home.

Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

It's Talib.

You see?

See how easy that was?

Now, I want you to tell me everything

that I need to know about this Talib.

Okay.

Very good, my dear.

You see?

I didn't want to cut
your fingers off anyway.

No, please!

Use the hammer.

[cashier sobbing]


[cashier screaming]

Yes, it's me. Look him up.

So some little monkey Talib

hired some little monkey whores to the-

yes, to the bus.

Yes, I know, but look. Listen.

It took me less than 24 hours

to figure all this out

without the help of your little bitch.

You need to let me stay for good.

So I will find this Talib

and I will find these whores

and I'll be back before Sunday.

Fine. Fine.

Yes.

Yo, snap out of it.

grimy ass cousin, Muffy.

She one of the few grimy ass
bitches in the land between.

They lined some getting
money niggas for us

a few times, but there's
something about this bitch

I just can't put my finger on.

No, you don't understand.

I'ma keep it 100 with you.

What the fuck was you expecting?

The picket fence?

The motherfucking house on the prairie?

This life you living wasn't given to you.

Your mom's a G, your daddy
ain't never coming home.

You're bugging.

Like what the fuck was you expecting?

You don't understand,
this man showing me

a whole different lifestyle.

Something I never seen before,

like I ain't ever have to
resort back to the streets

ever again due to this man.

Yo, shit happens for a reason,

and in every worse situation,

you gotta take the best elements out of it

and concentrate on that.

What the fuck are you saying?

Fuck it.

Let me speak in your language, all right?

Speak English.

You gotta take the good
with the bad, Keisha.

You know that.

At this point right now,

I'm going through a lot.

I got niggas after me, bitches after me.

I don't even know which
way to go at this point.

And this is exactly
why your ass need to be

not daydreaming about fucking Jack,

staying focused, and don't
be out here slipping.

Matter of fact, did you
find out who shot your man?

Let me tell you, I had
this nigga the other night.

This bitch Kayla aunt is on my body.

I can't get away from this bitch.

Wait, Kayla's aunt?

Listen, that's the bitch
that wind up killing Jack,

trying to get at me.

She think I got something to do

with Kayla getting killed.

Like this bitch is on me!

Wait, wait, what?

Let me tell you about this.

[slow motion, indistinct conversation]

[gunshot fires]


Hold up, hold up, hold up.

Let me see if I understand.

Tyler kills Kayla but the aunt blames you?

Yeah, and now everywhere I go,

this bitch just been popping up.

I can't shake her.

Popping up, like on some straight

following you shit?

Yo, you need to take care of that.

You need me to stay up here longer?

Because a bitch will cancel her shit.

I'll stay.

Nah, I got this.

I promise you, I'ma take care of this.

Let me get rid of these little
headaches I gotta handle

and I'm coming to see you

because I gotta get the fuck out of here.

Keish, look.

but you know my home is your home.

Yo, I gotta go.

I gotta catch this flight.

Fuck it, we outta here.

Coco's really my day one,

I'm thinking about it.

Ain't nothing wrong with that.

I just had to know,
but what that nigga do?

I don't know, he just be telling me

and shit like that.

How you don't know?

Here you go, acting like Keisha with it,

with this falling in love shit.

Like, do you even know his name?

I do know his name, and his name's KB.

Hm, okay.

But I'm thinking about asking him

to put us onto this investments
that he so called do,

because I'm trying to make
this money work for us.

Look, I'm all for that shit.

I ain't trying to look back.

Word, but I'm going.

[laughs]
All right.

Sha right hand man.

He basically handles all the dirty work.

That's about it though.

The trip was all right.
Everything else was bad.

Just left them people.

They talking about cutting us off,

Cutting us apart from every G.

Cutting us off?

My nigga, our money's
always right in the zap.

My nigga, we always on
time with everything.

Yeah, you're right with that,

but it's not about the money.

It's about all these shootings.

I mean, about the shit with
Bug and Syme and all them.

Nigga said, "Yo, it's bad for business."

I mean, this is basically,

I didn't even think I was gonna make it

out of that motherfucker alive, yo.

Nigga was so pissed off.

The nigga even offered
the motherfucking help

to get rid of these niggas.

Why not though?

Why?

Why I wanna get deep with these people?

I mean, once the motherfuckers

You know Dez?

Your Honor.

Your Honor, it appears
that my witnesses are dead.

We believe Mr. Coleman
arranged all of this.

Objection, Your Honor.

Mr. Coleman has been locked
up for the last two weeks.

What is he, a magician?

Your Honor, Mr. Coleman is the head

of a murderous drug gang.

Your Honor, even if all of that is true,

I think that the prosecutor should have

arrested him on all that.

Need I remind the
prosecutor that we're here

for a grand jury proceeding,

not an arraignment.

Listen, he's right.

We're not here for
hearsay about Mr. Coleman.

We're here to see if the prosecution

can show forth evidence

why Mr. Coleman should be indicted.

But Your Honor-
But Your Honor,

we do have evidence to show.


Miss Robison, if you have
no one to come forward,

I'm bound by law to dismiss this case

because of lack of evidence.

time to find more witnesses.

Your Honor, as pertaining to Clyde

versus the State of New York,

subtitle B, paragraph 34.

You have to dismiss this case.

we do have evidence

that has shown everything in our favor.

In addition, our witnesses
just magically disappeared

without actual evidence.

[overlapping chatter]

I have no further choice in this matter.

request a non-release waiver.

I suggest if you have
so much information

about the defendant, you make
your next case a stronger one.

Case dismissed.
