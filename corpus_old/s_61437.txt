First there was darkness.

Then came the strangers.

They were a race as old
as time itself.

They had mastered
the ultimate technology--

the ability to alter
physical reality

by will alone.

They called this ability
''tuning.''

But they were dying.

Their civilization
was in decline,

and so they abandoned
their world

seeking a cure
for their own mortality.

Their endless journey brought
them to a small blue world

in the farthest corner
of the galaxy...

our world.

Here they thought
they had finally found

what they had been
searching for.

My name is
Dr Daniel Poe Schreber.

l am just a man.

l help the strangers
conduct their experiments.

l have betrayed my own kind.

You are confused,
aren't you? Frightened.

That's all right.
l can help you.

Who is this?

l am a doctor.
You must listen to me.

You have lost your memory.
There was an experiment.

Something went wrong.
Your memory was erased.

Do you understand me?

No, l don't. What the hell
is going on here?

There are people coming
for you even as we speak.

You must not
let them find you.

You must leave now.

Hello? Are you there?

Hey, Mr Murdoch.
The automat called.

Said you left your wallet there.

l suggest you retrieve it
since you only paid for 3 weeks,

and they was up

l've been here 3 weeks?

lt's right there in
black and white, Mr Murdoch.

Day and date.

We make our books like our beds,
all neat and tidy.

l'll take care of it
when l get back.

See that you do. Only thing
that makes you a guest

in this joint, pal,
is cash on the barrelhead.

House rules.

Mr Murdoch, yes, where is he?

He just left not 5 minutes ago.

Sleep now.

When the rumba rhythms
start to play

Dance with me

Make me sway

Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore

Hold me close

Sway me more

Like a flower
bending in the breeze

Bend with me

Sway with ease

When we dance,
you have a way with me

Stay with me

Sway with me

Hey, sweetie!

He said he was your
husband's doctor.

He wanted to speak with you.

Excuse me.

Dr...

Schreber.
Please, won't you come in?

You must be Emma Murdoch.

Thank you for coming to see me
on such short notice.

What is this?

A rather crude experiment

designed to further my studies.

l don't understand.

You say you're
my husband's doctor,

but he never
mentioned you to me.

The truth is, Mrs Murdoch,

John has been coming to
see me for quite some time.

He had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal

stemming from your
marital difficulties.

John told you what happened?

Yes.

When was the last time
that you saw him?

3 weeks ago.

He packed a suitcase.
He was very angry at me.

l understand how difficult
this must be for you.

But for John's sake,
l would like you

to think of me
as your friend, Emma.

lt appears John has suffered
a psychotic break.

Complete memory loss.

You can't be serious.

Oh, but l am.
He may be delusional.

Even violent.

lf he were to contact you,
you must call me immediately.

Wherever your husband is,
he is searching...

for himself.

Good evening, Mr Murdoch.

lt is Mr Murdoch, isn't it?

Mr--was it
''J''-something--Murdoch?

J. Murdoch.

What's your name? Justin? Jerry?

No.

My name's Jason Murdoch.
John Murdoch.

Jake Murdoch. How's it going?

Hi. Jack Murdoch.

Hi.

Gotta get a grip on myself.

l told the guy
cash on the barrelhead.

l said, ''Listen,

Upstairs, sir, room 614.

Another call girl.

''J. Murdoch.''

Evening, Husselbeck.

lnspector Bumstead.

Your lace is untied.

Sir.

Am l glad you're here, sir.

They say Detective Walenski's
got the heebie-jeebies.

Just take what they
give me, Husselbeck.

Come on. l ain't got
any ltalian sausages.

l'm running out of plates.

Thanks a lot.

Excuse me.

Hello.

Oh, it's you.

You left your wallet here,
buddy.

Oh, when did l do that?

When you was last here.

When was that?

When you left your wallet.

You expect me to remember?

Hello.

Excuse me.

No, no, seriously.

Alleged?

Where you headed, chief?
Home.

And where's home?

Haven't you mugs got
anything better to do?

Well, l'm just trying
to do my job, May.

There's a killer out there,
in case you hadn't noticed.

Maybe you should be
out looking for him

instead of cooling
your heels, huh?

Aw, go on, get out of here.

Come on.

What's that make so far,
Husselbeck?

6 hookers in all?

l believe so, sir.

Give the man an ''A'' for effort.

So, Husselbeck,

what kind of killer
do you think stops

to save a dying fish?

You've got me, sir.

Bumstead, what took you?

This killer's been
running circles around us,

thanks to Walenski.

With all due respect,
Chief lnspector,

l've known Eddie a long time.

He's a good cop.

Whatever kind of cop
Walenski once was,

he let drift a long time ago.

Let me talk to Bumstead!

Come on, hold it!

Frank, Frank!

Whoa!

Get his arm!

On your feet.

There's no way out!

God, can you see?!

Let me go, let me go!

l'm not gonna hurt you.

What was that?

Walenski.

l'm being punished
for my sins, right?

What did l ever do
to inherit this?

Where do you begin?

Everything Detective Walenski

committed to paper
should be here.

The only thing that should
be committed is Walenski.

Nothing like a little
healthy paranoia.

lnspector Bumstead.

l came here to file
a missing persons report

for my husband.

Take it to the front desk.

They told me to come see you.

His name's John Murdoch.

Do these names
mean anything to you?

No. Who are these women?

Why are you looking
for my husband?

Are you going to accuse him
of something?

Maybe murder.

Whose murder?

Which one?

All of them.

Mrs Murdoch,

l'm sorry. l didn't
mean to alarm you.

l'm sorry that l came.

Just both made a mistake.

Please, if you'll just
give me half a second.

Have we met before?

lf we did,

l hope you're still breathing.

What's your name, honey?

John.

Well,
that's an appropriate name.

Yeah.

l was just thinking.

What you do...

seems kind of dangerous...

right now.

How do you know
l'm not the killer?

You don't seem like
the killer type. Why?

You feeling any urges
l should know about?

Aw, shoot.

So it seems you've discovered
your unpleasant nature.

Who are you?

We might ask
the same question, yes?

Sleep now.

Aah!

He can tune.

What is to be done?

This man is dangerous.

lt is said he is able to tune.

lmpossible.

We have seen it
with our own eyes.

On occasion, the imprinting
does not take.

They behave erratically
when they awaken.

We find them wandering
like lost children.

But this one was different, yes?

What has the doctor
to say about this?

He has failed to report in.

And Mr Quick?

No more Mr Quick.

Mr Quick, dead, yes.

Poor, poor Mr Quick.

Mr Book-- does he know?

Should we not know, Mr Hand?

We had hoped to learn more

before sharing with you.

We can know nothing
until we possess him.

We must have this man.

My brand, l hope.

John.

l've been so worried about you.

Are you punishing me?

You know, if disappearing
is your way of punishing me,

l don't appreciate it.

l don't know what
you're talking about.

l found these keys in my pocket,

so l assume l live here.

You supposed to be my wife?

Supposed to be?

John.

You really...

don't know who l am, do you?

Your doctor called me.

He was worried
this might happen.

My doctor?

Yeah. He, uh...

he gave me his card.

He's desperate to find you.

Schreber.

l feel like l'm living out
someone else's nightmare.

What happened to me?

Why was l seeing a doctor?

l had an affair.

You were angry at me.

Closing time.

The pool is now closed.

Dr Schreber.

How most unfortunate it is

that we were forced
to seek you out here.

You know how uncomfortable
we find all this moisture.

l'm sorry. l--

Failed to report in, yes?

l was frightened.

l have a weak heart, you know.

Your weakness is not, we think,
an affair of the heart.

We found this in his hotel room.

Must we reproduce
Mr Murdoch's memories again?

l tried to imprint him,
but he woke up.

He knocked the syringe
right out of my hand.

l tried to stop him.

He has no memories, then?

Only fragments.

The procedure,
it was interrupted.

l guess it's only a matter
of rounding him up.

You have had strays before,
right?

This is no stray, Doctor.

This one can tune.

But that's impossible.

l thought only you
had that ability.

You will process
another template

of the subject's
memories, yes?

Of course.
l'll imprint him again.

No. We require them
for a quite different purpose.

lt's almost midnight,
Dr Schreber.

We'll talk again
after tonight's tuning,

but no more delays, yes?

No more inconsistencies
in your behaviour.

The police are looking for you.

l know. l saw the papers.

''Killer Stalks
City's Streetwalkers.''

l was with one of those women

before l came here tonight.

l don't understand.

l met her outside an automat.

l guess l wanted to test myself.

l wanted to know
if l had it in me

to do those things.

Maybe l have lost my mind,

but whoever l am, l'm still me,

and l'm not a killer.

l believe you.

You do?

The car outside,

the one you arrived in.

lt's a cop.
He dropped me off here.

l didn't know he was still here.

John.

Hold it right there, mister!

Wait. You have the wrong man.

Stand aside, will you, please?

l didn't kill anyone.

Right now all you are
is a suspect.

Turn yourself in.

l'll listen to whatever
you have to say.

You're not gonna believe
what l have to say.

Try me.

There's someone after me.

There's this group of men.

They want me dead.

And l don't even know--

They're not even--

Yeah, who's gonna
listen to a madman?

Stand aside, Mrs Murdoch.

Run!

No one ever listens to me.

Murdoch, stop!

Murdoch!

How much further?

We're almost there, buddy.

Hey, you happen to know
the way to Shell Beach?

You're kidding.

Me and the missus spent
our honeymoon there.

All you gotta do is take
Main Street West to...

Or is it the cross...

You know, that's funny.
l can't seem to remember

if it's Main Street West
or the cross-town.

l'm sorry, lnspector,

l cannot be
of more assistance,

but l am running late
for an appointment.

Well, l appreciate
your taking the time.

There's just one thing
that puzzles me.

l've met quite a few murderers

in the course of my work.

Murdoch doesn't
strike me as one.

Perhaps you are not accustomed

to digging deep enough.

l do know when someone
is lying to me, Doctor.

lnspector, judging personalities

happens to be my business.

Well, maybe you could
give me a few pointers.

Certainly.

Let's take you, for instance.

You are a fastidious man,
driven. Consumed by details.

l would say your life

is rather lonely.

Good evening, lnspector.

l really must be going.

Come in.
Kate.

How is he?

The same.

Walenski.

lt's me, Frank.

Come in, Frank.

Close the door.

l've been looking through
some of your old reports.

lt's an interesting case.

The kind that can make
a man's career...

or break it.

Yeah, l was on that case.

And then what?

What happened then, Eddie?

Nothing happened, Frank.

l've just been spending time
on the subway,

riding in circles.

Thinking in circles.

There's no way out.

l've been over every
inch of this city.

You're scaring your wife
to death, Eddie.

She's not my wife.

l don't know who she is.

l don't know who any of us are.

What makes you say that?

Do you think about
the past much, Frank?

As much as the next guy.

See, l've been trying
to remember things--

clearly remember things
from my past.

But the more
l try to think back,

the more it all
starts to unravel.

None of it seems real.

lt's like l've just been
dreaming this life,

and when l finally wake up,

l'll be somebody else.

Somebody totally different.

You saw something,
didn't you, Eddie?

Something to do with the case.

There is no case.

There never was!

lt's all just a big joke!

lt's a joke!

Tonight's requirements

are 12 family photo albums,

9 personal diaries,

17 love letters,

assorted childhood photographs,

26 wallets,

lDs, and social
security cards.

These do bring back memories.

This one is still warm.

What is it?

The recollections
of a great lover?

A catalogue of conquests?

We will soon find out.

You wouldn't appreciate that,
would you,

Mr Whatever your name is?

Not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand.

Let's see.

A touch of unhappy childhood.

Ahh.

A dash of teenage rebellion.

And last, but not least,

a tragic death in the family.

Doctor.

Mr Book.

Aah!

Why does Murdoch not sleep

during the tuning
as the others do?

l don't know.

Maybe he's a step up
the evolutionary ladder.

A freak of nature.
He's adapting to survive.

What do you expect?
Weren't you looking

for the human soul?

That's the purpose

of your little zoo, isn't it?

That's why you keep
changing people

and things around every night.

Maybe you have finally found

what you are looking for,

and it's going
to bite you on your--

lt requires several
of your lifetimes

to master our gifts.

The idea that a simple man

could develop
the ability to tune--

ls absurd, l know,

but what other
explanation is there?

lt is time.

Shut it down.

Frederickson says he'll take me

off the damn night shift soon.

Well, it's about time, dear.

Hello?

Hello?!

Wake up.

Hey!

Wake up!

Wake up!

Wake up!

Hello?!

Can anybody hear me?!

Let the tuning commence.

The Goodwins. Jeremy, Sylvia,

Jane and little Matthew.

Jane and little Matthew.

The rich get richer.

Probably have maid's quarters

before the night is through.

Dr Schreber, l presume.

lt's you.

Hey, come on.

That's no way to greet
a patient, Doctor.

lf that's what you are,
huh, Doctor?

Mr Murdoch, please--

What is happening here?
Why is everyone asleep?

Shh. Please keep
your voice down.

Why can't l remember anything?

What have you done to me?

Nothing, nothing.

Please, l want to help you.

We can't talk here.

lt is not safe.
lf they see us together--

l don't care.
l want some answers.

l want some answers now!

Who are they?

Why are they trying to kill me?

Answer me!

My God.

You really can do it.

l did that?

Listen to me, John.
You have their power.

You can make things happen
by will alone.

They call it tuning.

That is how they make
the buildings change.

Just now you acted out of
self-defence. A reflex.

But l can teach you to control
your power consciously.

Let me help you, John.

Together we can stop them.

We can take the city back.

My glasses.

My glasses, please.

He made a terrible
impression for the firm,

lollygagging around as he did.

So l simply told Frederickson

l was going to have
to let him go.

And well you should have,
darling.

He attacked me.

l don't know where he has gone.

Come, Dr Schreber.

We have much to do.

Yes?

Yes.

They say that you're
a run-around lover

Though you say

lt isn't so

But if you put me down
for another

l'll know

Believe me, l'll know

Tonight's experiment
shall be conducted

in the following locations.

The first subject
shall be imprinted here

on Avenue M.

Mr Book, there is a problem.

There is no Avenue M.

We were unable to complete it.

During the last tuning, we
detected a lack of control.

An opposing influence
on the machines?

Then this man Murdoch

is more powerful
than we thought.

He's becoming like us.

So we must become like him.

The good doctor
has done as we asked.

The Life and Times
of John Murdoch,

Volume 2.

We must not do this.

Murdoch does not possess
these memories, yes?

How will his imprint
allow us to find him?

Everywhere he goes,

everyone he seeks out
will be known to us.

And as he follows the clues,

so shall we follow the memories.

But to imprint one of us.

Failure has always resulted.

What Mr Hand proposes
is our only option.

lmprint.

This may sting a bit.

ls it done?

Oh, yes, Mr Book.

l have John Murdoch...in mind.

''Johnny...

''l found this postcard
among your mother's things.

''Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

''Stop by sometime.

''We'll see if we
can't hook ourselves

''another mermaid.

Love to Emma. Karl.''

Karl.

Karl Harris.

Harris.

Harris.

''Harris Karl.''

Excuse me. Can you tell
me the way to Avenue C?

Try the subway.

You got a problem, pal?

You, uh, been working here long?

25 years,

no days off for good behaviour.

We're looking for John Murdoch.

Shhhh.

She knows nothing, Mr Hand.

A dead end, yes, Mr Wall.

We thought his imprint would
allow us to track him, yes,

but instead we have
been brought here.

This is irrational.

lnstincts are irrational,
Mr Wall,

and we must follow
where they lead, yes.

Mr Sleep suggests he
may go to places familiar,

his job.

He does not care about our job.

lndulge us, Mr Hand.

lf you were Murdoch--

Yes...

if...

l were Murdoch...

l would remember

how my wife had hurt me

by sleeping with another man.

And then...

l would look for a way
to hurt her in return.

Leave me alone with her.

There's work to be done.

All change, platform 3.

Platform 3, all change.

All change? Excuse me.

How do l get
to the end of the line?

You want the express.

No trains leave on platform 7.

You want platform 2.

Hey!

How come that train didn't stop?

That's the express.

There's no way out, you know?

You can't get out of the city.

Believe me, l've tried.

You're Murdoch, aren't you?

The one they've been
looking for.

You're not a killer.
They set you up

with a fake identity,

like everyone else
in this place.

Who are you?

Used to be a cop.

At least, in this life, l was.

They steal people's
memories, you know?

Then they swap them around
between us.

l've seen them do it.

Back and forth,
back and forth,

till no one knows
who they are anymore.

How do you know all this?

Once in a while,
one of us wakes up

while they're changing things.

lt's not supposed to happen,
but it does.

lt happened to me.

They'll come looking
for you, Murdoch.

Just like they'll
come looking for me.

But that's OK.

l figured a way out.

They were here.

Last night.

This was to be his home.

Ah.

That was when we loved her.

This is all well and good,
Mr Hand,

but we require
a more practical link

to his present whereabouts.

Yes.

And l know where to find her.

We're very lucky,
when you think about it.

l'm sorry?

To be able to revisit
those places

which have meant
so very much to us.

l thought it was more
that we were haunted by them.

Perhaps.

There used to be a ferry
when l was a boy,

biggest thing you ever saw.

Lit up like a floating
birthday cake.

That's just what my husband
once said to me

on this very spot.

Where is
your husband now?

l wish l knew.

What brings you here?

l met my wife at this place.

lt's where
l first met my husband.

Small world.

Hello?

Hello?

Aah!

What are you doing here?

l've been following you.

Hold it right there!

Johnny?

Johnny?

lt's been so damn long,

l thought you'd forgotten

your uncle Karl.

You son of a gun!
Ha ha ha ha!

Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

Uncle Karl?

Wait.

ls that me?

Yeah.

Shell Beach is where l grew up?

That's what l said.

Shell Beach, your hometown.

l need to get there, Karl.
How do l get there?

l don't know.

l haven't been there in years.

Come on. You must remember.

You gotta have some idea.

Come on!

Uh, sorry, Johnny.

The old cracker barrel
ain't what it used to be.

So bright there.

Brighter times, l guess.

You were always scribbling
in that damn book.

That's me and your pa. Ha!

What a couple of handsome fools.

What happened to my parents?

Where are they now?

They're dead, Johnny.

They died

when their house burned down.

l looked after you.

You don't remember that, really?

What's that?

Huh?

What is that?

What's the scar?

You burnt your arm
pretty bad in the fire.

What does it mean, Johnny?

lt means these are all lies!

My husband told me
he'd been here.

He told me he wanted
to test himself,

see if he was...

capable of...

l wanted to talk to her.

l thought maybe she
could help me find him.

Stay here. l'm gonna
call the station.

Stay back, miss.

lt's beautiful.

lt was a gift from my mother.

She died recently.

l keep it with me
to remind me of her.

l'm sorry.

lt's a funny thing, though.

l can't remember
when she gave it to me.

How do you think l could
forget a thing like that?

What's happening,
lnspector?

l'm not sure l know anymore.

l left your old room
like it was.

You can sleep here tonight, huh?

Glad to have you back, Johnny,

even if it is for just a night.

Karl.

Huh?

ls that the right time?

Why, sure. That clock's
kept perfect time

since l bought it.

A.m. or p.m.?

What do you think, Johnny?

l don't understand.
How can it be night already?

What happened to the day?
How'd l miss it?

You're tired.
Anything's possible.

Look, uh...

get some sleep. We'll...

straighten all this out
tomorrow.

''Guide to Shell Beach
by Johnny Murdoch.''

Oh, come on.

Hello?

Emma, he's here.

He's acting mighty peculiar.

l know. He's not himself.

Keep him there,
and l'll be right over.

l'll try.

Thanks, Karl. Bye.

Johnny...

l can't promise
anything, Mrs Murdoch.

We just have to
play it as it comes.

Johnny, we...

we just wanted to help. Ha.

Karl.

Uncle Karl.

Johnny, if you're
in some kind of trouble,

well, maybe we
could do something.

Haven't seen you in so long.

Yes.

Mr Murdoch...

you've been the cause
of much distress.

Start talking.

There's no need for this.

There's no escape.

The city's ours. We made it.

What are you talking about?

We fashioned this city
on stolen memories,

different eras, different pasts,

all rolled into one.

Each night, we revise it,
refine it

in order to learn.

Learn what?

About you, Mr Murdoch,

you and your fellow inhabitants,

what makes you human.

Why?!

We need to be like you.

l understand you now,
Mr Murdoch.

l remember that
which you do not,

what you've been missing.

The ocean, yes...

Running along the waves
as a child,

meeting Emma at the river,

that first kiss that followed.

What are you?

You've seen what we are.

We use your dead as vessels.

Aah!

Get in!

What about her?
Ring any bells?

She was alive when l left her.

What about this?

This is nothing. l...

lt must mean something,
all those pictures.

What pictures?

l don't understand this.

Stop playing games
with me, Murdoch!

Stop telling me lies!

l am not telling you lies!

Help me out here.

Make me understand.

l have this jigsaw puzzle

in front of my face,

and every time l try

to rearrange the pieces,

it still doesn't make any sense.

You think it makes sense to me?

l'm as much in the dark
here as you are.

You let me ask you a question?

You heard of a place
called Shell Beach?

Sure.

Know how to get there?

Yeah.

Can you tell me?

Right. You just, uh...

You go to the...

Where? Where do you go?

Just give me a second, will ya?

You can't remember, can you?

You think that's kind of odd?

Hmm?

Wait.

l got a better one for you.

When was the last time

you remember doing
something during the day?

What do you mean?

l just mean... during the day.

Ha. Daylight.

When was the last time
you remember seeing it?

And l'm not talking
about some distant,

half-forgotten
childhood memory.

l mean like yesterday?
Last week? When?

Can you come up
with a single memory?

You can't, can you?

You know something?
l don't think the sun even...

exists...

in this place.

'Cause l've been up for
hours and hours and hours,

and the night
never ends here.

That is crazy.

You're damn right this is crazy.

Listen to me, Bumstead.
lt's not just me.

lt's all of us.

They're doing something
to all of us.

Shut up. l've heard enough.

Please listen.

Shut up! Shut up!

There has to be an explanation

for this somewhere.

Explain this.

John, l'm so sorry.

l never meant to hurt you, John,

and l did it, and l
don't know why l did it.

l wish l could take it all back.

No. Emma...

you didn't do it.

This...affair of yours,
whatever it is,

the thing you're
supposed to have done,

you didn't do it. l don't
believe it ever happened.

What do you mean?

l know this is
gonna sound crazy,

but what if we never
knew each other before now?

What if the first time
we ever met

was last night

in your-- in our apartment,

and everything you remember...

and everything that
l'm supposed to remember

never really happened?

Someone just wants us
to think it did.

But how can that be true?

l so vividly
remember meeting you.

l remember falling
in love with you.

l remember losing you.

No, wait, wait.

Please, just...

just one more minute.

l love you, John.

You can't fake
something like that.

No, you can't.

lnspector? Sir?

Detective Walenski
killed himself last night.

l, um...

kind of thought you should know.

Oh, and...

the chief wanted to see you.

Sir...

l knew you'd track
the killer down, sir.

Um...

sir...

Shoelace.

How can we help you, sir?

You can sleep.

Gentlemen--

Sleep. Sleep.

Evening, sir.

Bumstead.

l want to be the first
to congratulate you

about the case.

Take us...

to Murdoch.

Sleep.

Dr Schreber.

l knew you'd
come eventually.

Don't you think it's about time

you started giving
me some answers?

Yes. Yes, of course.

Won't you please sit down?

l--l come here quite often.

lt's one of the few places

l'm allowed a moment's peace.

You--you see,
they have an aversion

to--to water.

One could almost
call it a phobia.

Who are they?

What do they want from me?

Right.

Well, for now, let's just say...

that you were the subject
of their experiment.

W-we all are.

l'm sorry about this.
l truly am.

But we do not have much time,

and l cannot afford the luxury

of doing this the right way.

Everything you need to know,

all the answers,

are in this syringe.

l need you to inject yourself.

lt's the only way to
make you understand.

You're kidding me, right?

We're running out of time, John.

You have to do this now.

Give me the gun, Doctor.

lnspector, he is more
disturbed than we thought.

l may not be the judge
of personality

that you are, Doctor,

but you're the one
who looks disturbed to me.

You do not know
what you are doing.

What, exactly,

is in this... Doctor?

All the answers you've
been looking for, John,

l swear to you.

Uh-huh.

Guess l'll just have to...

hold on to it for...

safekeeping,

if you don't mind.

Let's go, Doctor.

Go? Where are we going?

Shell Beach.

That's where you
want to go, isn't it?

The ocean.

You won't find anything there,

l promise you!
l've been there, and--

lf you've been there,

you can show us the way,
then, can't you?

l won't. l refuse.

You can't make me go there!

Don't you understand?

They'll be waiting for us.

l don't understand.

Used to be a bridge here.

Try that again, your friends
are gonna be fishing you

out of the canal.

Just don't hurt me.
l'll tell you everything.

lt doesn't matter
anymore anyway.

What?

Who are you people?

We must go to the end
of the canal.

We will give you

some more pretty things
soon...Anna.

l'm not Anna.

You will be soon, yes.

l have another use
for her first.

l call them... the strangers.

They abducted us
and brought us here.

The city, everyone in it...

is their experiment.

They mix and match our memories

as they see fit,

trying to divine
what makes us unique.

One day, a man
might be an inspector.

The next, someone
entirely different.

When they want
to study a murder,

for instance,

they simply imprint
one of their citizens

with a new personality,

arrange a family for him,

friends, an entire history,

even a lost wallet.

Then they observe the results.

Will a man, given
the history of a killer,

continue in that vein,

or are we, in fact,

more than the mere sum
of our memories?

This business of you
being a killer

was an unhappy coincidence.

You have had dozens
of lives before now.

You just happened to wake up

while l was imprinting you

with this one.

Why are they doing all of this?

lt is our capacity
for individuality,

our souls that makes
us different from them.

They think they
can find the human soul

if they understand
how our memories work.

All they have
are collective memories.

They share one group mind.

They're dying, you see?

Their entire race is on
the brink of extinction.

They think we can save them.

Where do l fit in?

You are different, John.

You resisted my attempt
to imprint you.

Somehow you have developed
their ability to tune.

That is how they change things.

That is how they
built this city.

They have machines very deep
beneath the surface

that allow them

to focus their
telepathic energies.

They control everything here,

even the sun.

That's why it's always dark.

They can't stand the light.

So why do they need you?

When they first brought us here,

they extracted what was in us.

So they could store
the information,

remix it like so much paint,

and give us back new memories

of their choosing.

But they still needed an artist

to help them.

l understood the intricacies

of the human mind

better than they ever could,

so they allowed me

to keep my skills
as a scientist,

because they needed them.

But they made me
delete everything else.

Can you imagine what
it is like being forced

to erase your own past?

What about my past?

What about my childhood?

Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

What about this?

This was blank
when l found it!

You still don't
understand, John.

You were never a boy,

not in this place.

Your entire history
is an illusion,

a fabrication,

as it is with all of us.

You made those drawings happen

with your gift.

You say they brought us here.

From where?

l'm sorry.

l don't remember.

None of us remember that,

what we once were,

what we might have been...

somewhere else.

l've taken you this far.

You don't need me anymore.

Let's go.

John.

There is no ocean, John.

There is nothing
beyond the city.

The only place home exists...

is in your head.

No! No!

John, stop!

Stop!

Please! No!

And now you know the truth.

No!

You'll allow yourself
to surrender, Mr Murdoch,

or it will result in
this one's death, yes?

What do l care?
She's not my real wife!

She's nothing to me!

But you do still care,
don't you, Mr Murdoch?

You see, l have
become the monster

you were intended to be.

Unh!

Shall l end her life now
as you would have?

Don't hurt her, please!

Then surrender,
Mr Murdoch.

Sleep.

Now.

John?

Sleep.

Kill him.

Kill him!
Kill him!

He is powerful, yes.

Dangerous. But he can also
lead us to what we seek.

What the doctor calls the soul.

lt is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase.

We no longer need
the other subjects.

The time for study is over.

lt is time to be one
with John Murdoch.

lt is time, Doctor.

lmprint.

Shut it down!

Shut it down forever!

What are you doing?

They want to imprint you

with their own
collective memories.

They want to make you
one of them

so they can share your soul.

But l've got other plans.

lmprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.

l'm sorry, John.

The pain will
only last a moment.

No!

Remember...

John.

You'll rise to greater
heights than that, my boy.

One day when you're older,
you'll understand.

Remember.

That's it, John.
Practice makes perfect.

Remember what l told you.
Never talk to strangers.

John, remember.

You're wondering why l keep
appearing in your memories.

lt is because l have
inserted myself in them.

Only, these memories
have been fabricated

to teach you
about the strangers.

Give you a lifetime of
knowledge in a single syringe.

You will survive, John.

You will find strength
within yourself,

and you will prevail.

Remember.

Hi, Uncle Karl.
Johnny!

You're getting
the hang of it, John.

Maybe one day
l'll be working for you.

This is the machine
the strangers use

to amplify their thoughts.

The machine
that changes their world.

You must take control of it.

You must make the machine yours.

l know
you can beat them, John.

But you must concentrate.

Something's wrong.

There is no time
for romance, John.

The world can be
what you make it.

What have you done?

You have the power
to make anything happen,

but you must act now!

l knew you
could do it, John.

You have their power now.

You control their machines.

Where's Emma?

She is not Emma anymore, John.

She has been reimprinted.

So give her back her memories.

l can't. The facility
where the strangers

stored the memories
has been destroyed.

l'm sorry.

What are you going
to do now, John?

l'm gonna fix things.

You told me l had
the power, didn't you?

l can make these machines
do anything l want.

Make this world anything
l want it to be.

Just so long as l
concentrate hard enough.

Where are you going?

Shell Beach.

What's the fare?
Quarter.

Oh, please.

Oh, no.

Thank you.

John...

Been waiting for you, yes?

What are you doing?

l'm just making a few little
changes around here is all.

Are we sure that's what we want?

l'm prepared to take my chances.

l'm dying, John.

Your imprint is not
agreeable with my kind.

But l wanted to know
what it was like...

how you feel.

You know how l was
supposed to feel.

That person isn't me.
Never was.

You wanted to know what it was
about us that made us human.

Well, you're not going
to find it...in here.

You went looking
in the wrong place.

lt's so beautiful here.

So bright.

Do you know if Shell Beach
is around here?

l think that's it
just over there.

l'm headed that way myself.

Would you like to join me?

Sure.

l'm Anna, by the way.

What's your name?

John.

John Murdoch.

When the rumba rhythms
start to play

Dance with me

Make me sway

Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore

Hold me close

Sway me more

Like a flower
bending in the breeze

Bend with me

Sway with ease

When we dance,
you have a way with me

Stay with me

Sway with me

All the dancers
with me on the floor

But my eyes
will see only you

Only you have
that magic technique

Where we sway,
l grow weak

l can hear
the sound of violins

Long before

lt begins

Make me thrill
as only you know how

Sway me smooth

Sway me now

You gotta sway me now

Come on, babe

Come on, babe

Sway, sway

Take me

Sway me
