[horns honking]

[tires screech]

[grunting and panting]

[cell phone dialing rapidly]

[cell phone ringing]

Danny.

Aaron...Did you
get the package?

What package?

<i>[Danny grunting]</i>

Danny, you all right?

<i>Messengered it
to your office.</i>

Do you have it?

<i>No, I've--I've been away.</i>

I'm heading back there now.

What is it?

<i>I need you
to finish it, Aaron.</i>

<i>It'll be dangerous.</i>

You can't do it
on your own.

415-555-0112.

No cops.

<i>Danny.</i>

<i>Danny, what the hell
is going on?</i>

Danny!

<i>Danny!</i>

[beep, dial tone]

[rapid busy signal]

[floor creaks]

<i>(man)
Aaron Cooper?</i>

Who the hell are you?

My name's
Christopher Chance.

You called me on your cell phone
about three hours ago.

I called a number.
It rang.

I didn't leave a message.

I'm a good friend
of your brother Danny's.

Both your parents,
they died in a car accident

when you were 12--
Danny raised you.

You're both crazy
about deep-dish pizza.

Whoa, whoa!

<i>You both like the girl
in the jumpsuit on Buck Rogers.</i>


Danny's dead.

I'm sorry.

He was a good man.

That number he gave you
is sort of a...

friends-and-family thing.

You call the number, and...

I know that
your life is in danger.

Whoever tossed this place
is gonna be back soon.

So grab whatever
you think is important.

Let's get out of here.

I've got no idea
what any of this is about.

<i>I mean, I'm a journalist,
but I do the local beat.</i>

This stuff is way
out of my league.

Do you know what your brother
did for a living?

He was a nonprofit lawyer
for the Grovener Foundation.

Danny wasn't a lawyer.

He was a counterintelligence
operative

<i>with the foreign service.</i>

Danny wasn't a spy.

No, he wasn't a spy.

He was a spy hunter.

<i>He was one of the best.</i>

So you worked with him?

No.

Well, not exactly.

Let me see that file.

Do you know how he died?

Um, cops said there was
no sign of trauma,

but heavy internal bleeding,

Like some acute
allergic reaction.

Nosebleed?

How did you know that?

Custom poison
fits the profile.

It looks like your brother
was following a Russian agent.

This russian agent
got to him first.

How is this possible?

Just 'cause
the cold war ended

Doesn't mean
all the spies went home.

<i>Look, Aaron, I know
this might be a lot</i>

<i>for you to take in
right now,</i>

but I think your brother
brought us together

so we could finish
what he couldn't.

Spies.

Custom poison.

I-I want justice
for my brother,

but I'm just a reporter.

I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

Right here.

The Russian embassy?

<i>(Chance)
So Danny knew the target</i>

<i>was going to a function
at the embassy today.</i>

All I got to do
is just go in

like Danny was planning to
and catch him.

Yeah, but you're leaving out
a couple of important details.

For one, Danny knew
who the hell he was looking for.

And two,
he had time to plan.

<i>You, on the other hand,
are looking for a ghost</i>

with only a couple of hours.

True, but I have Danny's notes,
and one advantage--

the spy thinks that the only guy
who could catch him is dead.

He won't be expecting me.

All we gotta do
is get in there,

identify the threat,
eliminate it

without causing
an international incident.

It wouldn't be the first time
we caused one.

Hey, dude.

Who are you?

I count
at least 50 soldiers

and security goons
on the embassy grounds alone.

<i>Breaking in's
not an option,</i>

not even for me.

Yeah, but even if you could,

I'm not sure these notes
are gonna be a huge help

in finding Danny's killer.

No, they're all
in some kind of code.

Code?

Cool.

This guy, Alexei Volkov--

He shows up
all over Danny's notes.

It's as good a place
as any to start.

Yeah, um, listen,

Do you mind excusing us
for a moment?

Listen, don't tell me
to take a breath

or tell me how hard
this is gonna be.

I know he was a friend.

No, I told you stories
of what happened in Kosovo.

Danny was the only guy
that would come back

And get me and pristina
during the shelling.

The idea
that he died alone?

His killer's
still out there.

I can't live with that.

Look, we're talking
about invading

Sovereign Russian soil
on a high-security day.

Now, look, we can do it.

I'm just saying,
let's be smart about it.

Take our time, plan it out.

Danny's killer's gonna be
inside that embassy today.

I don't care
what their security looks like.

I'm gonna go in
and get him.

[indistinct chatter]

Winston, I'm on my way in.

<i>(Winston)
Now tell me again how you're
getting past security.</i>

Same way Danny was going in--
right through the front door.

<i>"C.C. Baxter."</i>

Never heard of him.

That's 'cause he doesn't exist.
It was one of Danny's covers.

How do you know that?
Helped him build it.

Name, please.

Oh. C.C. Baxter.

Yes, Mr. Baxter.
Welcome.

Identification?

Uh, no, thanks.

Your photo I.D., sir.

Oh, yeah.

Of course, um...

Have you ever
changed what you're wearing

Just before you leave

and realize you left your I.D.
in your other...

Pants?

Wait here.

Mr. Baxter?

I'm Peter Blanchard,

State Department liaison
for today's event.

This is Alexei Volkov,
chief of embassy security.

<i>(Winston)
So Volkov is chief
of security over there?</i>

That's kind of a high-profile
job for a secret agent,

don't you think?


Uh, what seems
to be the problem?

Well, apparently you need
an I.D. to get into this thing.

Yeah.

The department of defense
put me on the list.

Maybe they can help.

I'll try the D.O.D.
social office for you.

Do you know who put you
on the list there?

Uh, Fred Galvis.

The Secretary of Defense?

Yeah, he asked me to make
the rounds for him here tonight.

<i>(Winston)
All right, listen.</i>

<i>I put a call
into Galvis' office</i>

<i>to give him a heads-up.</i>

<i>But I ended up
having to leave word.</i>

Hopefully, he's not still
holding a grudge

after what you did
to his boat...

<i>and his house.</i>

<i>Oh, God,
and that poor horse.</i>

Well, maybe the horse
wasn't really your fault.

<i>Ah, yes.</i>

Peter Blanchard from state
calling for the secretary.

<i>It's about a guest
at today's event</i>

<i>At the Russian embassy,</i>

A Mr. Baxter.

C.C.

C.C. Baxter.

<i>I'm sure he's quite busy,</i>

<i>but if you could just...</i>

<i>Oh.
Yeah, I'll hold.</i>

Mr. Secretary.

Uh, of course.

<i>I-I'll do
what I can. I...</i>

He wants to talk to you.

Yes, sir.

<i> (Galvis)
Mr. Chance,</i>

<i>I don't know what it is
you're up to,</i>

<i>and I'm not sure
I want to know.</i>

<i>but you said that you'd
ask for a favor,</i>

<i>and I honor my commitments.</i>

Thank you, sir.

He wants to speak
with you.

Mr. Secretary?

How exactly do you guys know
the Secretary of Defense?

He wasn't always
the Secretary of Defense, and...

You're not
our first client.

Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

Please enjoy yourself.

Thanks.

Excuse me, Mr. Baxter.

I thought you'd like to know
your guest has already arrived.

Guest?

Great.

<i>(Winston)
Wait a minute.
What guest?</i>

Well, whoever it is,
they're gonna be

looking for Danny's face,
not mine.

Fine, stick with Volkov.

<i>I'm not exactly sure
if he's our spy our not,</i>

<i>but like you said,
he's all over Danny's notes.</i>

So...

Just see
where he leads you.

What about you?

You having any luck
breaking Danny's code?

It's a simple
beaufort null cipher, dude.

Piece of cake.

What, weren't you
ever a boy scout?

No. Were you?

Order of the arrow,
troop 337.

Do a good turn daily.

Hey, 121467.
What--what's that mean?

Don't know.
Still working on it.

I thought you said
it was simple.

It's not a code, all right?

It's something else--
a password or something.

Well, obviously
it's important.

Look, it's on the line
three times.

What about all these words
surrounding them?

Maybe that'll give it
some context.

Respect
personal space, dude.

"insulin, charcoal...

Atropine, pRussian blue."

Wait a minute,
aren't these all--

Treatments for poison?
Yeah.

Didn't help Danny, did it?

Sorry.

Looks like the guy was trying
to piece things together.

He was closing in
on this guy named Raven.

That's probably
the code name to our spy.

Mm-hmm, and Danny
also thought

he may have had
the antidote with him.

Look.

It's common practice.

Look, if you were handling
a substance like that,

Wouldn't you maybe want to have
the antidote close by,

just in case
you got any on you?

Dude.

Chance...

<i>Chance,
we have a problem.</i>

I think whoever poisoned Danny
also got to Aaron.

You sure?

Chance, this is Guerrero.
I'm sure.

Listen, Guerrero,

<i>Do me a favor.</i>

<i>Retrace Aaron's steps.</i>

See if you can find out
where it happened,

Maybe identify the poison.

Oh, he's way
ahead of you, apparently.

Anything in Danny's notes
about an antidote?

Only somebody named Raven
may actually have the antidote.

<i>Raven may be
the code name for our spy.</i>

Well, right now
we have only one suspect.

I think it's time Volkov and I
had a little chat.

Hurry.

[light classical music]

â™ª â™ª

Looks like most of the exits
have a key-card access.

I'm gonna have
to liberate one of those.

Just give me a minute,
will you?

I need to create
a little distraction.

C.C. Baxter?

You're late.

And not at all
what I expected.

<i>(Winston)
Man, I hope you're not
waiting on my help on this.</i>

Thanks.
Um, I'm sorry.

Are you sure you have
the right guy?

Security said you'd arrived,
pointed you right out.

And you are...?

Carrie Jacobs...

Your guest.

Carrie, of course.

<i>(Winston)
Oh, man, I don't like
this at all.</i>

<i>Why in the hell would Danny
have invited a guest?</i>

There's not much
happening here.

Why don't we take
a quick walk outside,

Get to know each
other better?


Excuse me
just a minute.

Mm-hmm.

She's a hooker.

I beg your pardon?

<i>Danny must have hired her.</i>

Why would Danny
have hired her?

'cause he's a degenerate,

Partly because
arm candy is good cover.

Showing up alone
attracts attention.

Is everything all right?

Yeah. L-listen, I...

I'm not gonna be
needing a date...

tonight, but, um...

thanks for coming.

Uh...

I'm sorry, you...

You think
I'm a prostitute?

A $40 prostitute?

Well, I--

Oh!

Got him.

<i>(Winston)
Great, see where he leads you.</i>

<i>I'll check on Guerrero</i>

<i>and see if he's gotten
into Aaron's apartment yet.</i>

[electronic bleep]

[electronic bleep]

[elevator bell dings]

Hi.

Feedin' the cat.

Ah.

[lock rattling]

Closing in.
Stand by.

[Volkov speaking Russian]

Who's he talking to?

Spetsnas.

<i>Special forces
to guard a cocktail party?</i>

That's overkill,
even for these guys.

They know something's
going down today.

Uh-huh.


[continues speaking Russian]

[speaking Russian]

That was a close one.

Volkov's got the heavy hitters
together for something.

He was talking
about trying to apprehend

an unknown subject.

You know what I'm thinking?

<i>That they're looking
for the same spy we are.</i>

They're looking
for the same spy we are.

<i>Looks like a guard roster.</i>

They're not kidding around.

Whoever Danny's target is,
the Russians want him bad.

<i>Winston...
[cell phone ringing]</i>

Hang on a second.

What do you got?

<i>I just left
Aaron's apartment.</i>

The poison's here, dude.
It's airborne, and it's lethal.

<i>(Winston)
But Chance was in there too.</i>

Winston, we have a problem.

<i>(Winston)
You got in there not long
after Aaron did,</i>

<i>so I don't know how much time
that gives you</i>

<i>in terms of symptoms.</i>

<i>(Chance)
Which are?</i>

Uh...

Swings in body temperature,

Um, dizziness.

<i>Degraded dexterity
and motor skills.</i>

Chance?

<i>Chance, are you
still reading?</i>

Still here,
just not listening.

<i>Hey, ignoring this is not
gonna make it go away.</i>

<i>Now, we may need
to change the plan</i>

<i>and get you out of there.</i>

There's only one way
out of here.

I find the threat
before the Russians do,

or Aaron and I
run out of time.

There are two things
I know to be true.

If I were a prostitute,

I'd be a damn
expensive one.

And you are not
C.C. Baxter.

Did the hooker just punch you
in the face?

I don't think
she's a prostitute.


Okay, let's--

Last night
Danny turns up dead,

And then you turn up
using his cover.

Doesn't take a genius
to figure out

You're the spy
we've been hunting.

We?

Now you're gonna
come with me,

and we're gonna
exit the embassy,

And you're gonna answer
my questions.

No, I'm not.

One, I'm not a spy.
I'm a friend of Danny's.

Two, the femoral artery bleeds
just as fast as the jugular.

And three, I've been poisoned by
the spy that you're looking for.

I don't find him, I die.

So I think maybe we're looking
for the same guy.

Now, don't take this
the wrong way,

But I'm having a little bit
of a hard time breathing,

So can you just
get off of me, please?

I suppose you're one
of those scumbag mercenaries

that Danny always
talked about.

<i>(Chance)
Yeah, Danny and I had
some pretty good times.</i>

That's not
exactly what I meant.

You seem a little sheltered
for C.I.A.

Plus, you don't really
fight dirty enough.

So I'm guessing...
F.B.I.?

Emma Barnes.

I was Danny's liaison
with the bureau.

We were working together
to track down

a freelance spy,
codename Raven.

<i>He's been
a major security breach</i>

<i>for us for years--</i>

Stealing intel,
selling to anyone who'll pay,

and leaving a trail
of bodies in his wake.

Well, apparently,
he wasn't just a problem for us.

Volkov had a small army
on the lookout for him.

If the Russians
get a hold of him,

he'll give them
everything--

Classified information,
state secrets.

We'll never be able to stop
the bleeding.

Not sure how much I care
about that.

But if we're gonna
help each other,

I need to know
what was gonna happen today.

Raven stole the plans for
some kind of weapons prototype,

something the U.S. Government
would very much prefer

not to fall
into the wrong hands.

He's gonna sell those plans
here today at the embassy,

use this event as a cover.

If we don't catch him
making the sale,

which my intel
has going down at 5:00,

<i>he cashes out
and vanishes.</i>

And I lose my shot
at the antidote.

Let's get moving.

You first.

I don't ever turn my back

on someone
who does this for money.

<i>(Wilton)
Well, I don't think
I like her very much.</i>

Neither do I.

I didn't get your name.

Sure didn't.

Well, it took you
long enough.

Feel free to bring it up
at my next performance review.

Hey, dude.

Is that a defibrillator?

Nah.

Yeah, sorry.
Didn't want to alarm you.

Maybe we should revisit
that idea of getting a doctor.

I've already reached out
to the guys I can trust locally.

One of them's dead,
the other's in prison.

Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

You're sure you know
what you're doing?

You could say I got some
experience in this area.

[alarm blaring]

<i>(Winston)
All right, Guerrero's here</i>

<i>working on deciphering
Danny's notes.</i>

<i>We'll see if there's any
information about the drop.</i>

<i>(Chance)
You're cutting it pretty close.
It's almost 5:00.</i>

Where do you think
security went?

Probably fanned out
across the complex,

looking for the drop.

Okay, if Raven goes
through the trouble

to set up a meeting
inside the Russian embassy,

Wouldn't he want to have it
in a place you'd least suspect?

It's gonna happen right here.

You still there?

I'm here. I'm here.
Go ahead.

<i>You're in a crowded room.
You want to have an exchange.</i>

You don't want anybody
to know about it. How?

<i>Well, for sure
you want to avoid</i>

passing anything
hand to hand.

Something hard to monitor.

<i>Uh, wireless,</i>

<i>Bluetooth.</i>

Hey, yeah.

<i>You know, that's it.</i>

That's it--
the exchange is gonna happen

<i>via bluetooth device.</i>

I got a pairing number
right here.

Give me that.

<i>Here it is.</i>

Try this--121...

<i>467.</i>

You got it?
121467.

<i>(Chance)
I'll give it a shot.</i>

Who are you talking to?

I like to talk to myself.

Do you have a cell phone
I can borrow?

Bluetooth connections
are harder to hack into

than phone signals.

Unless we have
a pairing code.

Phones are linked.
We're in business.

Raven's downloading proof
that he has the plans.

This isn't a drop.
This is an auction.

<i>Why sell to one buyer
when you can get a rom</i>

full of the richest men
in the world

<i>to bid against each other?</i>

<i>It's perfect--
when it's over,</i>

everybody just walks away
scot-free.

Bid's already
over $20 million.

<i>Bidders
are dropping off fast.</i>

If he makes this sale,
we lose him.

Bluetooth range
is only a few dozen meters.

He's gotta be
in these rooms.

Which one?

Let's find out.

Type in, "this transaction
has been halted

by the U.S. Government."

What if this doesn't work?

Well, you get to haul my corpse
to a federal prison.

Hey, there, pal.

"Victor Shukoff."

He was a big-time
oil magnate.

He must have been
the buyer.

Raven made sure we never
got to question him.

Don't move.



You're not
what I thought you were...

not a neanderthal.

The thing that you pulled
with the bluetooth back there...

very impressive.

I'm so happy
you're impressed.

And just so you know,
when this is all over

<i>and I get out of here,</i>

I am gonna make sure
that you are recognized

for everything
that you did here today.

<i>When you get out of here?</i>

The bureau will figure out
some sort of bargain

for my release, eventually.

And what about me?

Well...

The poison will kill me

before we can figure out
a way out of here.

But listen, if you need me
to do anything for you...

You know, after the fact...

Just let me know.

Hey!

[speaking Russian]

[Russian accent]
what am I to do, hmm?

When a prominent
Russian oilman

Is found murdered

in my courtyard
of my embassy,

stolen Russian property

found in his possession,

and two americans found
standing over the body

with the murder weapon...

I am forced to ask myself
this question...

which one of you is Raven?

[garbled feedback]

Hey! Hey!

Aaron. Aaron.

Hey, get in here!

Aaron! Aaron!

I'm pretty sure
he can't hear you.

His heart stopped.
I know.

We're gonna start it again.

The instructions?

You were reading
the instructions?

They put these things
on school buses now.

We're not children here.
We can figure this thing out.

You said you were experienced
at this kind of thing!

I got experience putting people
in this situation,

not getting them out of it.

[electronic whirring]

See?
Get on with it,
would you?

Sure.

All right.

nothing.

[grunts in frustration]

Come on, Aaron, come on.


Thank God.
We've got a pulse.

Uhh.

Let's not throw
a party yet, dude.

<i>The poison's
shutting down his system.</i>

We bought him
a little time, but...

If we don't get
the antidote soon...

<i>neither one of us will talk
under these circumstances.</i>

We're being held
unlawfully.

You think we murdered Shukoff,
but if you checked our hands,

You wouldn't find
any gun residue.

<i>Proves nothing.
Maybe.</i>

But somebody in this complex
has proof on their hands

that they
fired a gun recently.

Now, if you puthe word out
that you're taking samples,

I guarantee you
Raven would make a run for it.

You're the head cop.

Think like a cop.

This is exactly
what Raven wants--

Danny's poison
to look like a Russian hit.

They frame us
for Shukoff's murder.

We're going back and forth
with each other

while he gets away.

You have every reason to lie.

Why should I believe you?

[speaking Russian]

[speaking Russian]

Listen...

I'm a friend
of Raven's last victim.

Thing is,
I've been poisoned too.

And I've got...

30 minutes
or less to live.

Now, everything's out.
We're all telling the truth.

And we all want
the same thing.

[door opens]

[approaching footsteps]

The state department liaison

is demanding access
to see you.

Watch them.

Are you out of your mind?

You just compromised my cover
on my entire project.

And for what?
To save your own butt.

Well, I'm kind of
attached to it.

But that's not what
I'm thinking about right now.

No? What's that?

How does he know we're here?


[door opens]

The two of you all right?

So far.

I want you to know
I'm going to formally protest

<i>the treatment
you've received here.</i>

This is outrageous!

Mr. Blanchard,

I agreed to allow you access
to see these two,

<i>to show that they have
not been mistreated.</i>

If we can agree
this is the case,

then I will
ask you to leave.

I can't agree to that.

You've caught
two american spies here.

How can I be sure if I leave,
they'll be treated fairly?

We're not spies.

Of course you are--

A spy known as Raven,

<i>Caught in the act,</i>

and who, when captured,

managed to kill
three soldiers

and the chief of security.

Where's the antidote, Raven?



What are you doing?

Looking for keys.

Can't we just pick it?

Right. Next idea.

Did you get all that?

I didn't get much,
but I heard gunfire.

You all right?

<i>For the most part.</i>

Blanchard's got a key on him.

Potomac Motor Inn,
room 12.

<i>It's right down the road.</i>

Maybe he's got the antidote
stashed in there.

<i>All right, room 12.
We're on our way now.</i>

We'll pick you up
at the embassy, west gate.

What are you doing?

This doesn't look good
for either one of us.

There's evidence on this thing
of what just went down.

I can make my case,
clear my name.

Excuse me.

What are you doing?

Oh, what's the matter
with you?

The video of this entire thing
was stored in there.

I know. It's got my face
on there too.

We can't have that
floating around.

It's bad for business.

Sorry.
Sorry?

Sorry?
You're sorry?

How am I gonna prove
any of this?

That sounds like
a tomorrow problem.

Let's get out of here.

There's another exit.

Service entrance
by the east gate.

Damn it! They must
have found the bodies.

That doesn't look
promising.


Shouldn't I drive?

He's got to keep it cold.

Dude, I got the antidote.
I'm heading to you now.

[crowd gasping]

[tires squeal]


[tires squeal]

Now what?

[tires squeal]

Don't even think about it.

You got a better idea?

[tires squeal,
glass breaks]


All right,
we're going up and over.

[bangs door]

Come on.
A little help here.

[man shouting in Russian]


[bullets ricocheting]

[bullets ricocheting]

Come on, on your feet.

I need to get you
to the hospital.

I don't think I can get up.

No, you--you can't die.

You're my only witness
to this whole mess.

Witness?
I lost Raven.

I was involved
in an international incident

on Russian soil, and...

if I lose you,
then who'gonna back me up?

And besides that--

[tires squeal]

This is gonna hurt, dude.

Who the hell are you?
Ohh.

No one special.
Nice dress.

Let me see that.

That did hurt.

Come on, let's go.

Let's go!

Wait a minute.
Hold on.
Sorry, lady.

How--how am I gonna
get in touch with you?

No, no, you can't
just disappear.

I'm--I'm gonna have
to owe you one.

See ya.

[tires squeal]


Russians are claiming
that Chechen terrorists

<i>tried to seize
their embassy.</i>

"an investigation continues

"as to whether the FBI
had an undercover agent

within the compound
at the time of the attack."

I'm gonna prove
what happened.

Ah, yes.

Your phantom witness, right?

Not a phantom,
a person...

with fingerprints...

[electronic bleeping]

That the lab
just pulled off of this.

All right, mystery man,

<i>Who are you?</i>

[footsteps approaching]

<i>Hey.</i>

Yeah?

You got a visitor.

Hi.

How you feeling?

Better.

Come on in.


I read your article.

Danny would've been proud.

Thank you.

And thank you...

For everything.

But I actually had
one more question.

Sure.

What?

I need to know--

Who was my brother, really?

He was a lot
of different people.

He was whoever he had to be
to get the job done at the time.

That's what made him so good.

No one could ever quite
pin him down.

It's kind of
the nature of the job.

Sounds lonely.

See, when you're
a guy like Danny,

You can't have
any attachments.

It distracts focus,

Puts people you care about
in danger.

I'm guessing that's why
he never told you.


Thank you.

Couple of things.

One, if anybody asks,
we never met.

And if I call,
pick up the phone.

It might be important.

You got it.

Take care.

What's up with you?

I got an alert somebody
just ran your prints

at the F.B.I.

Oh, yeah.

It must have been climbing
over the wall.

I think I got my prints
on her side of the handcuffs.

You left your prints?

Why the hell would you leave
your prints?

I didn't do it on purpose.

You didn't forget
to wipe 'em

So she'd have a way
to find you eventually?

I saw the two of you
before we picked you up.

You think I'd risk everything
for a woman?

What am I, 14?

So it was a mistake?

Yes.

You're sure?

Yes.

Winston, if I never
see that woman again,

it'll be too soon.

Uh-huh.
