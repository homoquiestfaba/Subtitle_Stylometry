They are all drunk as Africans.

It is how do Africans.

African ...

Africans do so, get drunk,

bottles break after each other in the head.

And then they slap. You do the same thing.

You will end up as the Africans who drink.

Last winter, my daughter Carmelina,

He had hurt his hand on the door and took her to the hospital.

It was December or January and saw an African shirtless.

It was almost naked, and very cold.

He was naked and you could punch the wall.

He could punch in the door.

It was all broken out, face, arms,

It was full of blood. I was scared.

He gave punch at all. - And the police were there.

I had police there. - They beat him with ...

The officers were dismayed with the baton.

You know what happened once? I saw one while making purchase.

And he told me: "Come here." I said, "What do you want?"

And I said, "How ugly is ugly African, go away."

He said, "No, come here."

He took my hand and said, "Wow, what a great hand."

And I said, "Your ugly black, go away I'm afraid."

He scared me.

I did not understand what he said.

He said that when drunk trying to steal his animals.

When I drank.

No one could fool the dad.

Do not smoke much, Pio. - Leave me alone.

Pio, you turned off the power? - No.

How not?

You can not go on like this. How will we pay the light?

Who will give us money? - How do I know?

Did not know? - How do I know?

Instead of walking behind his brother,

do what I say.

Understood? Go, get moving. - Go connect the wires.

Mother. Mother!

At where? - Out there.

Good evening. - Good evening.

A word.

Where are you going? - Let me go.

You can not come with me. - Do not fill my bag!

Go back inside. You can not come with me.

Will soon! - Will you stop it?

Close the door!

That's good? - Go to sleep and do not fill the bag.

And do not cry.

Gosh, I do not know what to do.

He did not listen to me.

It's driving me crazy.

I do not know what to do, can not stand it.

How often should I say not to steal in Gioia Tauro?

No one took nothing there.

Only we took cars in Reggio Calabria.

They do not know the black Fiat Punto?

No, no.

But if he were here, I think would not you?

Only if you talked about it all day. - he's gone a Fiat Punto black.

I also theft, but did not get that car.

And you do not know anything? - Anything. I'll get them in Reggio.

All right, beauty. - I'll pretend that nothing happened.

Let's let it go, it's just a car.

But we have work to do. We will go to a house in Tonnara.

When? - Today they will go to a wedding.

You can go? - I go. I am free.

But we are respected by all.

Up by the Italians.

In the prison of Palmi,

I had a guy who had been arrested in Brazil.

In his cell, they pissed and cagavam on the floor,

Stop getting involved with these Africans!

Why call it African?

We need to think of ourselves

and you care about the African?

No other way, so do not!

Which way? Tell me that way.

Or they'll kick you out, you can not go back to Ciambra.

You need to call him and keep him here.

Let's do it and everything is solved.

I will not do enough!

Do not be a child, Pio.

The guy who comes with the truck is my friend.

Let's carry and he pays on time.

I brought my brother he never had sex. Never.

Who agrees to do the job? - I did.

I do not because I know him.

So I do. - You? Are you sure?

Absolute. - I can call him?

You can. - Beauty.

Go! You see if you are real man.

Come in, boy.

What did you do here? - I fell.

Does it hurt? - A little.

But you're well? Are you sure?

You run a lot.

You should not run, but it hurts.

Pio! Come here!

Go Pius.

Come here, Pius!

Come on!
