Do me a favor and just, um,

Can we just talk

Okay.



[EERIE MUSIC PLAYING]

WOMAN: So, why are you
here, Hayden?

Why now after all this time?

Sometimes I find myself
doing things

that I don't want to do.

<i>I have these thoughts,
these desires.</i>

I try to quiet them,
I try and suppress them,

but I can't.

What kind of thoughts exactly?

Horrible ones.

So, what do you think
caused the change in you?

So many things.

<i>One night I saw
this documentary</i>

<i>on Satanic cults,
and I was captivated.</i>

<i>I don't know why,</i>

<i>but from that moment on,</i>

<i>I researched everything that
I could about the religion.</i>

<i>I read every night.</i>

<i>I learned all that I could.
I became obsessed.</i>

<i>I couldn't stop
even if I wanted to.</i>

<i>And then one day,
all my anger unleashed.</i>

<i>All my hate, all my fury.</i>

[WOMAN GASPING]

[WOMAN GRUNTING]

HAYDEN: <i>In that moment,
the feeling was exhilarating.</i>

<i>The need was fed.</i>

<i>That feeling soon passed,
the need vanished.</i>

<i>And all that was left inside
me was fear and resentment.</i>

<i>But what I didn't know
is that the need would leave</i>

<i>the door to my soul open.</i>

[CAR DOOR OPENS]

<i>For years, I've watched dark
thoughts play at my mind's doorsteps.</i>

<i>And as the darkness walked
inside of an open door,</i>

<i>an evil so pure came out.</i>




<i>I never did find her.</i>

<i>A few weeks later,
I got a gig as a video assistant</i>

<i>to help record a seance.</i>

<i>But everything went haywire.</i>

[LINE DIALING]

[LINE RINGING]

[PHONE RINGING]

Hello.
Mrs. Watkins,

I've assembled my team and I'm
on my way to you right now.

No, no, please don't.

Things have been fine
for the last few days.

My husband doesn't want
anyone coming over here.

He made that perfectly clear.

Mrs. Watkins.
Your daughter is in serious danger.

I found evidence that
the land your house is on

used to be used
in Satanic ceremonies.

Ever been to one of these?

Yes.

Is this shit for real?

Yes.
I have my doubts.

How did you get this gig?

I work in video production
at the school. Why?

It's gonna take more than
a video production class

to handle what
you're about to see.

You need to tell your husband,
and we need to do this tonight

<i>Otherwise,</i>

<i>I fear that the demon is gonna
make an attempt on your daughter.</i>

<i>Please, just trust me,
Mrs. Watkins.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

Okay.

I'll be right there.


Evil's very powerful.

It'll play tricks on you.

Whatever you see,
whatever you think you see,

don't let go
of each other's hands.

What if we do?

You lose your soul
to the other side.

And?
And you'll bring darkness upon this realm.

So, we do as I say,

or put everybody
else at risk.

Yes.
You understand?

Yeah.

Yes.
Of course.

Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee tonight,

confess to all my sins because I dread
the loss of Heaven and the pains of hell.

But most of all because I
have offended Thee, my Lord,

who is all good and
deserving of all my love,

I firmly resolve with
the help of Thy grace,

to confess my sins,
to do penance and to amend my life. Amen.

Lord, may the living water

of your heart purify us.

May you surround us and guide
us with your loving light.

In the name of Christ,
I command you to come forward.

It's here.

I sense it.

In the name of Jesus,
I command all authority

and I bind all the powers...

Hello.

Hi, Daddy.

Hi, honey, what's wrong?

I didn't want to tell you because
I know you're going to lecture me.

Okay, well, I'll try
not to lecture you then.

<i>Tell me, what happened?</i>

I don't know.
It's been a really weird day.

Why? What happened?

Earlier this morning
I was getting coffee,

<i>and I'm at this rest stop</i>

<i>and this weirdo spills his
coffee all over the ground.</i>

<i>At first I thought, you know,
he just burnt his tongue or something.</i>

<i>And then he turns
to me and says,</i>

Don't drink that.
<i>"Don't drink that. It's full of maggots."</i>

Were there maggots?

No, he was crazy.

<i>And then, just now,
this car pulls up behind me</i>

<i>with its high beams on.</i>

<i>Literally forces me
out of its way,</i>

<i>and it had a whole other
lane to go around me.</i>

<i>So, I moved a little
to the lane,</i>

<i>and then it just
started messing with me</i>

<i>and staying side
by side with me.</i>

<i>And I literally had to
slam on my brakes</i>

<i>for it to get going.</i>
[ACCELERATING]

Did you see who it was?

No, they had black tints.

You see, this is exactly
why I didn't want you

to take this trip alone.

Come on, Daddy.

I'm really freaked out
about the whole thing

and you're not helping.

Do you mind just
staying on the phone

with me for
a little while?

Yes, of course.

And don't tell Mom.

Last thing I need
is for her to worry.

I won't.

I felt awful
leaving today.

Come on. We both know
what kind of opportunity

that this is for you.

She wouldn't have it
any other way.

I know.

Oh, my God.

[INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING]

Um...

I'm on Route 10.

I'm about ten miles away
from Lake City.

You made it
that far already.

Didn't I ask you
to stay the speed limit?

Daddy.

Daddy, there's

Can you see who it is?

No, I can't see,

Good, 'cause I'm not.

You're learning the secrets

It's just a book I found.

So, what happened?

Girl, you'll never

and it's just my luck.


Last night, I was
at Lou's Bar

and I ran into
one of my old clients.

Alone, Celine?

Yes, I know,
but I knew him from way back then,

and I thought it was set.
There's a fucking psycho out here.

[CELINE SIGHS]

So, what happened?

So we're in the room,
and everything is cool

until he pulls out
this razor.

And I'm like,
"What the fuck is that for?"

And this psycho told me

he wanted me to initial
his name on his penis.

I can't do
this shit anymore.

I can't, I can't [LOUDLY]
do this shit anymore.

Every time one of them
walks in the door,

we gotta wonder
if it's just another John

trying to get off,

or some fucking psycho,
sadistic asshole

who wants to
live out his fantasy.

And every time I see another
one of those girls on the news,

it's like I'm living
vicariously through her

and then Ala's face
pops in my head.

And I play out
this whole scenario

where the cops have to
come to my house,

tell my little girl that
her mommy's not coming back.

[VOICE BREAKING] And I see her
face, Celine.

She's devastated.

That little girl
loves me so much.

You know,
she's the only reason

I was able to
overcome my past,

and I'm gonna make
damn sure that I'm there

to provide for her.
