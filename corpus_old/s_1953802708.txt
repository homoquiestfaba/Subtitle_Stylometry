Santosh, see if they want to...

...go to Kathmandu.

Kathmandu?

Kavita?

I am coming.

Iéˆ¥æª“ on the way.

I am coming.

Hello?

Hey

Howéˆ¥æªš it going?

I left my unit and crossed the border.

I am now in nepal.

Madam is here.

Madam my husband has arrived in Nepal.

Is he at home?

No, he is on the way.

Prepare tea for us.

Ok Madam.

Ok,ok

Where?

Ask around.

Do as they say, please.

Thatéˆ¥æªš what I came here to do.

I will.

Donéˆ¥æª› worry.

Ramhari Daju?

Yes, it is me.

I want medicine.

What medicine does a man...

...based in Darjeeling need?

We have not had kids.

You married?

For 4 years.

Who would expect a childéˆ¥

...without getting married?

Where does your wife live?

She is in Kathmandu.

You are in Darjeelingéˆ¥ï¸¹â‚¬

...and your wife in Kathmandu?

And you dream to have baby? Huh?

Itéˆ¥æªš not like that.

I visit her on my vacations.

Like right now I am going to Kathmandu.

We are really having a problem conceiving.

Weéˆ¥æªe consulted many doctors.

My wife had heard of you.

Many people recommended you.

Okay, Lieutenant

Drink this up.

I need to drink it here?

Yes, right now.

You must reach home within 36 hourséˆ¥

...and be in bed with your wife.

Sure, sure, sure

How many passengers are there today?

Santosh, get them in.

Iéˆ¥æª’l be there tomorrow morning.

Be ready.

The medicine only lasts another 33 hours.

Nothing will stop me. Iéˆ¥æª’l be there.

What is this!

Santosh?

Go out and see what this bandh is about.

What is this!

Are you going?

Such a long line man.

Whatéˆ¥æªš this bandh about?

How long is the bandh supposed to last?

We donéˆ¥æª› even know who called the bandh!

Doesnéˆ¥æª› look like the bandh will end soon?

No,I donéˆ¥æª› think so.

Where are you people heading to?

Kathmandu?

Letéˆ¥æªš tie this here.

Hold this end.

Hey - letéˆ¥æªš just tie this.

Please! Letéˆ¥æªš just tie it!

Pooja?

Yes, my parents told me youéˆ¥æª™e here.

What about your American girl friend?

How does she pronounce your name again?

éˆ¥æ·Žvireléˆ¥

I know. Did I get that right?

Who is that Pooja?

Who was that?

A friend from Katmandu.

When will you get back?

Iéˆ¥æª’l call and let you know.

For you.

Teddy?

He looks like you.

Arenéˆ¥æª› you going to introduce me...

...to my future motheréˆ¥æƒn-law?

Donéˆ¥æª› shout!

My mother might be home.

I have booked a ticket for day after tomorrow.

Mama!

Oh, Pooja has also arrived.

Why donéˆ¥æª› you tell her yourself?

Dad?

What? Whatéˆ¥æªš the rush?

Do Aviraléˆ¥æªš parents know about this decision?

What would you like?

This one?

Anything else?

Where are you?

I am leaving this evening.

Do you want a gift from here?

You donéˆ¥æª› need  anything!

Not even the money that I borrowed from you!

Donéˆ¥æª› flirt.

Ok, I have your money.

That will make you happy, yes?

Call me as soon as you get here.

Ok

Did you eat?

How is she?

Her fever is worse!

What did she eat?

Not much.

Iéˆ¥æª’l put a cold cloth on your forehead.

You should eat something and then sleep.

What do you want to eat?

Should I make you some rice?

Do you think they will call it off tomorrow?

You canéˆ¥æª› say .

No one know how long...

...this will continue.

Last time this happened...

...it went on for 45 days.

You never know when bandhs will start...

...or how many days they will last for.

It must be tough for you...

...but since the end of the war...

...weéˆ¥æªe come to expect this.

Driver

Please shut that door.

Why?

Shut it first.

I have learned that wedding vehicles...

...are allowed to pass during bandhs.

So, I suggest...

...that we make this into a wedding bus.

Weéˆ¥æª‡ need banners and lots of other  things.

We can manage all that.

If we can just get through this weéˆ¥æª’l be free.

In this kind of indefinite bandh...

...is there any guarantee theyéˆ¥æª’l let us through?

No. They stop hearses sometimes...

...but they never stop marriage vehicles.

Well, if thatéˆ¥æªš true it would be great.

We have a musical band with us right?

Yes.

We have the entire set right?

Dress as well?

Weéˆ¥æª‡ need a bride and a groom.

There are plenty of young kids here.

Do you want to be the groom?

Wait a minute...

Iéˆ¥æ¦™ like you to be the bride...

...and you to be the groom...

Wait - what are you saying?

You are getting engaged tomorrow...

...you must have clothes right?

Is this theater for children?

If it solves our problem, why not?

This wonéˆ¥æª› solve our problem!

Do you want to get through or not?

Of course.

We all need to get through.

Do you just want to sit here and wait?

We all need to get through.

Why donéˆ¥æª› you just play the groom?

Why donéˆ¥æª› you?

How can he?

He is old enough to be your father.

Iéˆ¥æª‡ like to know whose bus youéˆ¥æª™e planning to drive.

You need to help us out.

What are you talking about?

They will smash and burn my bus.

We have to take some risks if we want to get out.

Iéˆ¥æª“ happy to talk to you, mother.

But you know father doesnéˆ¥æª› accept who I am.

Is he still angry with me?

I donéˆ¥æª› have a bad spirit mother...

You donéˆ¥æª› understand me either!

I donéˆ¥æª› have a bad spirit, mother...

...how I am is how I will always be.

Are you in love?

You have been sitting in front...

...of that mirror for two hours.

Old lady.

What?

Old lady?

I look like an old lady?

Arenéˆ¥æª› I beautiful?

Yes. A beautiful old lady.

You are the one who is getting old...

...sitting in front of that computer all day.

Who are you chatting with?

New boyfriend.

Letéˆ¥æªš go out.

Not now.

I told you I donéˆ¥æª› want to go.

Iéˆ¥æ¦¤ talking to Pratiek.

We are here in the Eastern part of Nepal...

...in the middle of a tea garden in illam.

We have here a local tea farmer with us.

Hello? Vishal.

You were not online last night.

Are you okay?

Whatéˆ¥æªš wrong?

The hat.

Look what I have brought.

Keep the noise down...

...people are already doubting us.

Will it stay?

Happy wedding!

Everyone in line!

Itéˆ¥æªš a wedding! Itéˆ¥æªš a wedding!

Itéˆ¥æªš a wedding!

Pull the driver out!

How could this wedding bus suddenly appear?

If youéˆ¥æª™e lying we will smash you and your bus!

Why would I lie?

Pull the driver out!

Okay, okay it seems real.

Okay, let it through!

It better be real.

Itéˆ¥æªš a wedding bus.

Hello bhai!

We just got through the bandh.

We had to stage such a drama to get through.

Anyway, we will be there by tonight.

If my husband get there before me...

Iéˆ¥æª“ taking this stuff off, too.

Take him home. I will come home.

Your coat.

Whose hat is this?

Give it to me.

Madam my husband has arrived.

Is he at home?

He is on the way to Kathmandu.

Radhika?

Yes, madam?

You can go home now.

I will just do a little more.

Itéˆ¥æªš late.

You can do it tomorrow.

Iéˆ¥æª’l just finish and go.

Donéˆ¥æª› worry about it.

You can do it tomorrow.

Should I drop her off?

Ok.

Ok.

Donéˆ¥æª› push me away.

I have a problem, Neeraj.

What problems do you have?

I am here for you.

Whatéˆ¥æªš wrong?

I am pregnant.

Wow, with my child!

How can you be so happy?

Why shouldnéˆ¥æª› I be?

I am going to be a father.

You know that my husband is coming.

Who cares? Let him come!

I donéˆ¥æª› give a damn.

I will kill him!

I will kill anyone...

...who comes between us.

We staged a huge drama...

I will tell you when I get there...

...and you will have a good laugh.

Of course Pooja is here.

We are moving now and should be there soon.

Is Aviral going to pick us up?

Were you serious then?

Your little drama really helped us.

At least we will reach Kathmandu on time.

Donéˆ¥æª› be so fussy...

...it has benefited you the most..

Sorry, the number you dialed...

...cannot be reached at the moment.

Sorry, the number you dialed...

...cannot be reached at the moment.

Show me sarees for a bride.

I wanted to have a big wedding for you...

...but everything has become so expensive...

We should do what we can afford.

Its not that simple.

Stop using that damn phone!

The engagement is the day after tomorrow...

...but you still havenéˆ¥æª› arrived.

Where is Pooja?

Ok, sure auntie.

Whatéˆ¥æªš this bad connection?

Whose wedding are they talking about?

What happened?

People are coming, letéˆ¥æªš go now!

People, we have demanded the creation...

...of a Limbuwan state east of the Arun.

Weéˆ¥æª™e fighting nonstop for that.

We hope you will continue supporting us.

It looks like another bandh.

Were is our bride?

Get the band out.

We demand a Limbuwan state.

Itéˆ¥æªš a wending bus, please let us through.

Let the marriage bus through.

Sit down quickly.

I hope after this there is no problem.

Why donéˆ¥æª› you want to keep this baby?

Is it your first child?

Yes.

How many years have you been married?

Many.

Does your husband agree?

Yes, he agreed as well.

Do you know risks of abortion?

Thereéˆ¥æªš always a chance...

...you wonéˆ¥æª› be able to have another baby.

You had Neeraj take her home last night?

Radhika?

Please come here.

The officer wants to talk to you about Neeraj.

You know him, right?

Yes

Did he take you home yesterday?

My diamond ring was stolen yesterday.

How was it stolen?

Please tell him what you know.

You should know if Neeraj has...

...stolen anything from here, right?

Did he say anything?

He didnéˆ¥æª› say anything.

You didnéˆ¥æª› talk on the way home? Donéˆ¥æª› lie.

Please help.

He stole money from the office, too

Sit on the step below.

Hey - did you take your daughter to the doctor?

I havenéˆ¥æª›.

Why not? You might lose...

...the thing you care most...

Donéˆ¥æª› be careless.

You better go soon.

Why did you take the thermometer out?

Can I go to play sometime?

No.

No, I have stopped going with customers.

If my boyfriend the driver found out...

...he would be very upset.

He is mad in love with me.

That is not it.

I donéˆ¥æª› feel comfortable doing that anymore.

Are you in love?

You have been sitting in front...

...of the mirror for two hours.

Old lady!

What? old lady?

I look like an old lady?

Arenéˆ¥æª› beautiful?

We want to get off!

How can you leave us!

Get your stuff together.

Wait! Sit down! Sit down!

Do we all want them to come with us....

...to Kathmandu?

Yes! Yes!

We canéˆ¥æª› go with you.

We need to report back to the company for work.

We can pay you whatever would earn.

How can you leave us now?

Itéˆ¥æªš not that simple.

We came all this way together!

It feels like a real marriage now.

Weéˆ¥æª’l have a real party in Kathmandu.

Itéˆ¥æªš not that easy...

...we need money to get back.

Come on, come on, letéˆ¥æªš  go!

So are we all going?

Weéˆ¥æª’l give you whatever you want.

Santosh, get in.

So, what do you do?

Iéˆ¥æª“ studying medicine.

What year?

First year.

Were you forced?

Forced? No, of course not.

The person you are trying to reach...

...is not available...

...please leave a massage after the tone.

Hello, Pratiek?

The man who hurt Deena is a policeman.

I am outside of his police station right now.

We are ruined.

It had to breakdown in the middle of nowhere.

Weéˆ¥æª’l have to wait until morning.

Arenéˆ¥æª› you sleeping?

Can I have some?

Look at me.

Hey éˆ¥

Want some liquor?

No, thanks?

Are you sure?

Thanks, anyway.

Okay, lets drink.

Does your mother know you smoke?

No. let me know if sheéˆ¥æªš coming.

Is there a boyfriend?

How many times do I need...

...to call you to get my money?

I donéˆ¥æª› even know what to say.

Have I ever, bothered you...

...about money before?

If I was not desperate for my daughter...

...I wouldnéˆ¥æª› be begging like this.

And itéˆ¥æªš my own money!

Iéˆ¥æ¦²e had enough!

You just keep that money for yourself!

You can keep it the rest of your life...

...but donéˆ¥æª› show your face to me ever again!

Go!

Just go, you fucker.

Havenéˆ¥æª› you seen a girl before?

Pull slowly.

Why did you take so long?

Why are you here?

Iéˆ¥æª“ hungry.

Why didnéˆ¥æª› you just call?

Start packing.

Neeraj.

Give me one night.

Ok, you know where to come.

Hotel Dreamland

Sundhara

Room number 307

You better come.

Go now.

Please.

It's Radhika.

Madam, I know where he is.

Neeraj.

He is in a hotel in Sundhara.

Hey, Bikash.

Do you know if something is wrong...

...with my wifeéˆ¥æªš phone?

I have been calling her since yesterday...

...but havenéˆ¥æª› gotten through.

Network problems shouldnéˆ¥æª› be this continuous.

Go and make sure everythingéˆ¥æªš okay.

We should at least have seen if sheéˆ¥æªš okay.

Youéˆ¥æªe been in the States too long...

...you donéˆ¥æª› know what itéˆ¥æªš like here..

We just hit a woman!

If weéˆ¥æª‡ stayed there...

...people would have burned the car!

We should have gotten out.

Someone will take her to the hospital.

We shouldnéˆ¥æª› have just run away...

You are getting married in two days.

If we had stayed...

...we would have gotten into trouble..

What is wrong?

Nothing, he is just worried..

What happened, Aviral?

Your marriage is soon.

What will people say if they find out?

Where are you going?

Dad éˆ¥

...what must have happened to that lady.

Being scared wonéˆ¥æª› solve anything.

People must have taken to her to the hospital.

Think about yourself.

Excuse me.

We need more medicine.

Where have you been?

Hello?

Yes?

Yes it is my wifeéˆ¥æªš number.

Accident?

Accident?

Whose accident?

Which hospital?

Who is this?

Yes sergeant.

Whose accident?

Is it your wife?

Yes.

I got stuck in two bandhs.

I donéˆ¥æª› know.

I hope Iéˆ¥æª’l be back to see you again soon.

Wow!

I see a lot of buses lined up ahead.

Hello? Canéˆ¥æª› you see?

Driver! Hello? Pull over now!

Bring stones, guys.

His daughter has been killed in an accident!

Nobody gets through until we get this settled!

Let us through, his wife has also had an accident.

Hey boys, bring me stones!

Iéˆ¥æª“ going to sit in the back of the bus.

Driver?

Have you seen my daughter Pooja?

No, I havenéˆ¥æª›.

I canéˆ¥æª› find her.

Did you stop while I was asleep?

We stopped once.

Canéˆ¥æª› you find Pooja?

No, I canéˆ¥æª› find her anywhere.

I have to go..

Wasnéˆ¥æª› she sitting with you?

She was, but I fell asleep.

When did you realize?

I just found out.

Iéˆ¥æ¦¤ sorry, I have to go.

You should stay - Pooja is missing.

I have a feeling sheéˆ¥æª’l be fine.

The boy at the door...

...must have seen something.

Where do I look for her now?

Shit!

I have to watch the road...

...you should watch after your own daughter.

Driver!

My bag is still inside!

Stop the bus!

She is better now.

Who are you?

Her husband.

Is she better now?

She is recovering quite quickly.

But unfortunately, we couldnéˆ¥æª› save your baby.

Itéˆ¥æªš ok.

Did you say a baby?

We couldnéˆ¥æª› save the baby...
