Ayiva Seihon.

Where to?

Burkina Faso.

ZabrÃ©.

2,000.

Take this for now.
It should help.

Try to spend it slowly.

Hopefully things will get better
the further along we get.

Yes, I know.

It's so you can manage, for now.

Right now, it's tough,
but it'll get better.

Do you understand?

Yes, everything is fine.

Yes.

We are here.

Abas?

He's here.


He wants to get with
those European girls.

You know what I'm saying.


Look what Mades
put on Facebook.

Hold on.

He's big now.

Look at this.

<i>[people speaking French]</i>

<i>[Women laughing,

[in French] As my colleague
told you, I can find you work.

So you can gather money
and pay for your trip.

[in French] Okay.
We will think about it.

Ayiva.

Come here.

Here's your money.

Don't count it in front of me.

We don't count money here.

[indistinct chatter]

[indistinct chatter]

[in French] Hey, man.

[in French] Can we have
a word with you?

No, I have things to do.

We have contacts in Tripoli.

[indistinct chatter]

We can't stay here and work.

It will take us
at least two months

to save enough money.

Our brothers in Tripoli
won't wait for us.

We will lose our places
on the boat.

And we cannot take that risk.

Listen.

If you can help us get to Libya,

I promise to get you
a place on the boat.

You know very well
I can get you there.

But if I get you to Tripoli,

I want two places.

I got this!

Starting now,

we're out of here!

Really? We're out?

I got this!

[in English] Oh,
are you not sleeping?

Why are you disturbing?

Don't you know people
are sleeping?

Look at the idea of the time.

[in English] We stop.
We stop. We promise.

[in French]
Are you stupid or what?

Go to bed before
I will sleep, please.

[in English] Okay, okay.

<i>[boisterous techno music

Move along, quickly.

This is Mano.

He's your guide.

[wind whooshing]

You pick a point.

Aim for it.

And once you get there,

you pick another one

further away

and you head for that one.

That's how he does it.

No.

Uncle Ousman,

I want to talk to you
about something.

Yes, sir.

When we arrived in Sabha,

He'll send it.

[people chattering indistinctly]

[in French] Listen up!

This boat doesn't

I need a driver,

He's joking, right?

[people speaking in French]

[in French] Why can't we go?

[in French]
You have to take us, sir.

We paid you.

[in English]
Hey, motherfucker!

I'll do it!

Oh, I'll do it.

If none of these motherfucker
want to do it,

I'll do it.

I'll drive the boat!

[in French] If you're driving
the boat, I'm not going.

What he said?

[in English] He said
you can't drive the boat.

Oh, fuck you.

If you're a man,
stand up and drive the boat.

[in French] You'll never
take that boat anywhere.

So sit down.

She's not supposed
to drive it; You are!

We paid you!

[all clamoring]

Calm down.

I can do it.

I believe I can drive the boat.

Where are you from?

Burkina.

There's no sea there.

How are you going to drive us?

You don't know how to drive.

I'm not going if he drives.

Me neither.

Do you want a beer?

No. Mm.

How was the journey?

It was okay.

Did you find papers?

They gave us three months.

You'll need to find
a job with a contract

to get real papers.

Three months isn't enough.

How are things back home?

Same as before.
Mm.

Except they built solar panels

for the school in the village.

Mm-hmm.
Boukare did all of it.

Ah, mm-hmm.
He built it all.

He did great work.
Mm.

He built the school
and sent the solar panels.

Mm.

It's normal. He has to.

He came here a long time ago.

And he has the money.

It's for our children.

By the way,

have you heard from your sister?

Mm.

Not yet.

Why not?

Because we couldn't
call anyone.

You had no way of calling her?

Call her right now.

Take the phone!

I'll do it later.
Call your sister now!

She's taking care
of your daughter,

and you can't even call her?

Is this normal?

Listen to me.

It's more dangerous
than you think.

I'm telling you,
you can't do it.

I'm telling you,
it's too dangerous.

[in Italian] Quiet!

People live here,
for fuck's sake!

[in English] Sorry.

[in French] I'm sorry I yelled,
but you don't know what I saw.

It's too dangerous

I just got here.

As soon as I make some money,

I will send it to you...

Right now, there is less.

But I'll try to figure
something out. For you.

Go inside and get it!

Is everything all right?
Yeah, and you?

Yeah, me too.

You need anything else?

Why don't you buy
this motorino?

Bye.

Eat.
Bon appÃ©tit.

You want to work, right?

I've always worked.

Then tomorrow,
you'll go back to work.

The same way?
For the same money?

[in French] Same thing.
Yes, you will do that.

Don't play professional.

You think you're
too good for this?

"Me, I don't work here..."
And how will you eat and sleep?

Anyway, Momo is an asshole.

I'm done working for that guy.

Why?

[in Italian] Hello.
Attention, please.

First, we want
to thank Mama Africa

for allowing us
to have this meeting.

Thank you.


Thank you.

I'm happy to be here
with all of you

and to hear you call me Mama.

And because you left
your mothers at home,

I'm happy to welcome you.
Okay?

Everything's fine.

Oh. You found some other work?

Yes, for this guy, Rocco.
Who?

He has a beard.

He's kinda tall.

Ah, Rocco, yes.

I don't know him,
but people speak about him.

This man can get you
a work contract, everything.

You get your pay slips,
all that.

And then, it's possible
to have your papers.

[in French] You're not eating?

You must eat.

So you were able
to find some work?

[in French] Yeah.

I sent some money to Aseta.

Oh, that's a good thing.

She asked me...

if they could come here.

Come here for what?

There's nothing
for women to do here.

You know how it is.

There's no work for women here.

You think you'll make
a home for them here'?

You know you'll go back.

They want to come here.
And it's their choice.

I can't do anything.

I'm the one who
brought you here.

You're here.

You know you're with family.

I talk...

but you don't listen.

I'm trying to manage
this on my own.

[silverware clangs]

Okay, do what you want.

About that.

I went by the school

and spoke to the girl
that works there.

You want to get with
every girl you see, don't you?

Even the teachers.

Hey, hey, that's not it.

I didn't talk about that.

I asked her about
bringing Aseta over.

She said that
with a residence permit

and a work contract, you can
do a family reunification

and you can bring her easily.

It's not that easy.

I don't care.

I'm not gonna end up with
some ugly village woman.

Okay?
I'm too handsome for that.

Hmm?

You're crazy.
Look at her.

She's pretty, no?

You like it?
You like it?

Marta, ask him if he likes it.

He understands

Okay.

They understand.
When they want, they understand.

But how do they live?

Let's stop talking
about problems.

Tonight, in my house,

we're gonna talk about
positive things, okay?

Come on, gimme five!


Please, let's not talk

No, no, no.

Mama, be quiet or else...

Okay, let's pretend
it's nothing.

I can get you another job

at Marta's birthday party.

Can I ask you something?

Go ahead, Ayiva.

Can you help me
get a work contract

so that I can get
a residence permit?

I understand you, Ayiva.

When my grandfather
went to America,

he was in New York City.

He worked hard, really hard.

But he earned almost nothing.

He and his family had
to take care of each other-

with his sisters,
with his brothers,

with his cousins.

That's how people should do it:

Help one another.
