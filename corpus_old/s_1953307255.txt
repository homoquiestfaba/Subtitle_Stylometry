HE SAID HE WAS
IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE.

HA HA!

OH, HERE IT IS.

FUCK YOUR PERSONALITY.

WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

YOU LIKE A GIRL
FOR HER PERSONALITY?

HELL, YEAH.

NO, YOU DON'T.

IF SHE LAUGHS
AT MY JOKES.

THE GUY ENDS UP
CHOOSING THE GIRL

WITH THE TITS.
THAT'S IT.

OH, COME ON.

IF SHE'S GOT
NICE TITS,

SHE'S GOT
A NICE PERSONALITY.

I KNOW YOU DON'T
MEAN THAT.

I DO MEAN IT.
I'M 100% ON IT.

IF SHE'S GOT A NICE ASS,

SHE'S GOT
A NICE PERSONALITY.

IF SHE'S GOT NICE TITS,

SHE'S GOT
A NICE PERSONALITY.

IF SHE'S GOT
NICE LEGS,

SHE'S GOT
A NICE PERSONALITY, END OF STORY.

SAME ASSHOLE, HUH?

ONE OF MY KIDS SAW HIM.

THE GUY'S GOT
A CROSSBOW.

THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

HEY, HEY, HEY.
WANT TO PRESS CHARGES?

NO, BUT I WISH
Y'ALL WOULD JUST GO OVER THERE

AND TALK TO HIM.

LISTEN, FRIEND.

IT SURE WOULD BE
A HELL OF A LOT BETTER FOR YOU

IF WE WENT
OVER THERE AND TOOK THE MOTHERFUCKER IN.

NO. NO, IT WOULDN'T.

COULD I JUST GET
YOU GUYS TO GO OVER THERE

AND TALK TO HIM, PLEASE?
WOULD YOU JUST, PLEASE?

OH, YEAH, YEAH.
WE'LL GO OVER THERE AND TALK TO HIM.

GREAT.

THANK YOU.

FRANCIS.

THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU CAN READ.

MATHER.
NAME'S MATHER?

YOU COMING ABOUT HER?
HER STUFF'S GONE.

WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR ARM?

LIKE I SAID,
IF YOU'RE COMING ABOUT HER STUFF,

IT'S GONE.

I REMOVED ALL OF IT.

Morning: IS THAT RIGHT?

WHAT DID SHE LEAVE
ON YOUR ARM?

I HAD HER GODDAMN NAME
EMBLAZONED BELOW THE CORPS,

BUT SHE TURNED OUT TO BE
A FUCKING CUNT,

SO I HAD HER TAKEN OFF,
IF IT'S ANY OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS.

FINE. NOW, DID YOU--

DID YOU
SHOOT ARROWS

IN THAT MAN'S HOUSE
OVER THERE?

ARE YOU NAMED
AFTER THE SAINT-- SAINT FRANCIS?

ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER
THE QUESTION?

AM I CHARGED
WITH SOMETHING?

THAT CAN BE
ARRANGED.

Francis: IS THAT
A CROSSBOW BACK THERE?

YOU MEAN, IS THAT
THE CROSSBOW I USED TO SHOOT ARROWS

OVER IN THAT SACK
OF SHIT'S HOUSE? WELL, THE ANSWER'S NO.

THEN HOW HE FUCK
DO YOU FIGURE THEY GOT OVER THERE?

WELL, HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA STAND THERE

AND FUCKING PUMP ME

WHAT POSITION?

QUARTERBACK.

I GUESS THAT'S
THE ONLY THING

I LIKED
ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL.

GOD, I LOVED PLAYING
ON THAT TEAM.

THOSE FRIDAY NIGHT
UNDER THE LIGHT,

BLUE AND WHITE
UNIFORMS.

IT WAS LIKE
THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD STOP US.

[WHISTLE BLOWS]

I WAS BACKUP,
THOUGH.

ALWAYS
PISSED ME OFF.

I REMEMBER
THE COACH SAYING,

I DON'T KNOW,
I HAD A PROBLEM

LISTENING
TO WHAT HE SAID

OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

I REALLY JUST HAD
A PROBLEM AGREEING WITH HIM.

THEN I SLUGGED HIM.
HE KICKED ME OFF THE TEAM.

HA HA!

[ENGINE STARTS]

OH. LOOK AT THIS.

HEY, LADIES,

IF I HAVE TO PUT
THIS CHALUPA DOWN TO CHASE YOU,

I WILL WRITE YOU UP,

AND, CREW CUT,
YOU WANT TO PICK UP THAT SODA CAN?

WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
UNTIL THE TRUCK STOPS, GENIUS,

BEFORE YOU GET
OUT OF IT?

THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO!

NOW, GO GET
YOUR 5 CENTS ON IT.

PULL AWAY SLOWLY.

THERE YOU GO.

YOU BOYS KNOW THEM?

YEAH. THEY'RE
SKIPPING PRACTICE.

IS THAT RIGHT?

WHO YOU GUYS
PLAYING NEXT?

SAINT ANTHONY.

SAINT ANTHONY'S
NOTHING WITHOUT THEIR FULLBACK.

THAT'S RIGHT.
HE BLEW HIS KNEE OUT

IN THE THIRD QUARTER
AGAINST JEFFERSON LAST FRIDAY.

OH, YEAH!

THAT COACH THOMPSON
OVER THERE?

WE GOT WORK TO DO.
LET'S GO.

I WANT YOU BACK
OUT THERE ON THAT FIELD.

LET'S GO!

HI. IS THERE A PROBLEM?

OFFICER?

HEY, COACH.
NO. NO PROBLEM.

JUST, UH, JUST TALKING
TO SOME OF YOUR BOYS HERE.

SEEMS THAT A COUPLE
OF THEM SKIPPED OUT ON PRACTICE.

YEAH, I KNOW.
THEY'RE JUST CHEATING THEMSELVES

AND THE REST OF THESE
YOUNG MEN BACK HERE.

YEAH. WE PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE PULLED THEM OVER

IF THEY HAD MANAGED
THAT U-TURN.

WE CAN STILL GO GET THEM
IF YOU WANT US TO.

DON'T BOTHER.
I GOT SOMETHING FOR THEM

WHEN THEY GET BACK.

YEAH, I BET.

WELL, WE BETTER GET GOING,

SO, UM, GOOD LUCK

OK. STAY HERE.

HEY. COULD YOU GET

ABOUT THE 1/24,
THE LITTLE ONES?

PLASTIC BOTTOM,

[DOOR OPENS]

I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

ABOUT WHAT?

YOU'RE HERE
ABOUT DAVID, RIGHT?

WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING,

AND I DON'T WANT

WELL, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS?

YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE HIM?

I MEAN, I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED ME

TO TESTIFY
OR SOMETHING.

NO. HE HAS
HIS HEARING TODAY.

WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO LOCATE HIM.

MA'AM, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

HE'S WATCHING ME
ALL THE TIME.

I MEAN, COULD

THAT WOULD BE
A WORSE IDEA.

GOING INSIDE

WELL, CAN YOU
JUST GO, THEN?

Woman: LISA?
SHUT UP, MOM!

NO, NO. LISTEN.

SPIT IT UP!
SPIT IT UP!

ALL THE PRESSURE.

ALL I HAVE

HE SAYS IT'S GUM.

SHUT UP!

â™ª BUT I NEED TO FAKE
THE WILL TO GET ALONG â™ª

WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU LAUGHING AT? HEY.

COME ON, MORNING.

THIRD DATE, SHE GOES
TO SHAKE MY HAND.

I MEAN, KISSING
THIS GIRL'S CHEEK

IS LIKE GETTING

I SAYS, "LOOK.
I'M GOOD AT TWO THINGS.

"THE SECOND THING
IS ARRESTING PEOPLE,

"SO IF YOU WANT
SOME OF THAT, BRING IT ON,

"BUT IF YOU WANT ME
TO DUMP MY EMOTIONS OUT ON A SILVER PLATTER,

YOU TOOK THE WRONG
GODDAMN EXIT."

HELL, MORNING.
SHE ACTUALLY GOT OFFENDED BY THAT?

[SIREN BLARING]

FAT COP.

MAN, THAT PROBABLY
WASN'T EVEN WHAT SHE WAS ASKING FOR.

NO. LOOK.
IT'S MY EXPERIENCE

THAT WOMEN WANT
SOMETHING DANGEROUS FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

BUT JUST A LITTLE WHILE,
AND THAT'S OK BY ME,

BUT--WELL, LET ME ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

SO YOUR EX-WIFE,
SHE JUST STOPPED TALKING, AM I RIGHT?

NO. IT'S A LITTLE
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

YEAH. SEE?
COMPLICATED.

THAT'S--THAT'S WHY
ALL MY RELATIONSHIPS ARE STRICTLY OCCASIONAL.

I MEAN, I STILL--
LOOK. I STILL--I HAD

SOME GREAT TIMES
IN MY MARRIAGE.

YEAH.

I DID. I DON'T
REGRET MUCH OF IT AT ALL.

WAS IT WORTH GETTING
HOSED IN A DIVORCE?

THAT'S NOT MY POINT,
THOUGH, MORNING.

Dispatcher:
41-20 AND 41-50.

I GOT A SECOND CALL
AT THAT LOCATION.

THIS ONE CAME AS A 10--

I'M GONNA PUT MINE AWAY,

BACK IN MY HOLSTER,
ALL RIGHT?

YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS, BELIEVE ME.

ALL RIGHT?

ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,

BUT DON'T DO
SOMETHING DUMB. [CLICK]

Officer: THIS IS 184.
ALL CLEAR IN BUILDING 3.

Dispatcher: 10-4, 184.
126, WHAT'S YOUR 20?

FUCK!

Dispatcher:
126, DO YOU READ?

Dispatcher: 733,
I'M CONFIRMING THAT 10-71 AT VINE AND BARGAS,

POSSIBLE HIT-AND-RUN.
NO OTHER DETAILS.

OFFICERS ON THE SCENE?

Dispatcher: NEGATIVE.

CAN WE JUST HOLD OFF?

WHAT?

LET'S JUST WAIT
FOR ANOTHER UNIT, OK?

WE'RE RIGHT THERE.

Dispatcher: 733,
WE'VE GOT E.M.S. EN ROUTE.

YOU COMING?

YEAH, IN A MINUTE.

HUH?

IT'S A GODDAMN
FENDER BENDER.

DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE.

Officer on radio:
THIS IS 133. WE'RE GOING 10-21.

Dispatcher: 10-4, 133.
MAKE IT A QUICK ONE.

[PERSON COUGHING]

HUH?

SO WHERE WERE YOU HIT?

JESUS. WHAT PART--
WHAT PART OF YOUR TRUCK WAS HIT?

OH, UH, MY SIDE.
THE DRIVER'S SIDE.

LISTEN, DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU COULD START IT FOR ME

SO I CAN TAKE IT
TO THE STOP 'N WASH?

CAROL, I CAN TAKE
A LOOK, BUT WE'RE THE POLICE, OK?

WE'RE NOT TRIPLE-A.
I'LL TRY TO HELP OUT, BUT--

I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO STOP BEING A COP FOR, LIKE, TWO MINUTES

AND HELP ME OUT.

IS THAT SUCH
A BIG DEAL?

MISTER?

CAROL?

CAROL?

MORNING.

JESUS, MAN,
YOU GOT TO SEE THIS.

MORNING, YOU SEE
THAT WOMAN?

WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

CAROL? MORNING!

Morning: DON'T MOVE HER!

CAROL. CAROL.

Morning: THE AMBULANCE
IS COMING.

CAROL, LOOK AT ME.

Morning: I SAID
DON'T MOVE HER!

Francis: MORNING,
SHE'S DYING!

HEY. LOOK AT ME.

THERE'S PEOPLE COMING.
THERE'S PEOPLE COMING.

I WANT YOU TO
PULL IT TOGETHER,

ALL RIGHT?

ALL RIGHT?
GO FOR A WALK.

TAKE A LOOK
AT THE TRUCK.

Francis, voice over:
I'M--I'M-- I'M FUCKING UP.

I'M FUCKING
EVERYTHING UP.

NO, NO. LOOK,
YOU'RE JUST IN A SLUMP.

YOU'LL SNAP OUT OF IT.

I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S NOT A SLUMP.

I'M GONNA QUIT.
YOU KNOW WHY?

BECAUSE I'M A SHITTY
FUCKING COP.

I'M A SHITTY COP.

AND I'M--
I'M GONNA QUIT.

YOU'RE NOT A SHITTY COP,
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA QUIT.

HUH.

YOU'RE A GOOD COP.

OK, TELL ME,
WHY AM I--

HERE YOU GO.

THANK YOU.
WHY AM I A GOOD COP?

HUH? NO, NO,
SERIOUSLY. LOOK.

JUST SINCE I'VE
KNOWN YOU,

I'VE BEEN BEAT UP,

I'VE BEEN SHOT AT
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURE,

AND THEN I GET
MY GUN STOLEN,

AND THEN
THIS WOMAN DIES RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME

BECAUSE I'M NOT
PAYING HER ANY GODDAMN ATTENTION.

SHE WOULD HAVE
DIED ANYWAY.

YEAH, MAYBE,
BUT I DON'T SMOKE,

AND I'M DIVORCED,
AND I'M GETTING PISS-DRUNK

IN A TWO-BIT JOINT.

HEY, FIRST OF ALL,
THIS IS NOT A TWO-BIT JOINT.

THIS IS A RESPECTABLE
ESTABLISHMENT.

"B"...WELL,
I DON'T HAVE A "B,"

BUT "C,"
YOU ARE A GOOD COP.

WHY? WHY AM I
A GOOD COP?

YOU'RE GOOD
WITH PEOPLE.

SO WHAT? I'M GOOD
WITH PEOPLE.

WELL, I'M SHITTY
WITH PEOPLE.

THE PROBLEM
WITH PEOPLE IS,

YOU SAY SOMETHING,
THEY SAY SOMETHING BACK.

THAT JUST
PISSES ME OFF.

BUT YOU, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE PATIENT.

YOU TREAT THEM WELL.
YOU TALK TO THEM.

YOU SEEM TO RESPECT THEM.

I CAN'T GET THROUGH
TO ANYBODY.

I CAN'T GET THROUGH
TO THIS KID. I--

YOU'RE A GOOD COP.

DON'T EVER DOUBT THAT.

AND, UH, IF YOU QUIT,

IT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE
TO THE DEPARTMENT.

YOU OK WITH THAT?

I GUESS.

COULD YOU BRING HIM
HIS BEER, ROSE?

COULD YOU PUT
A NIPPLE ON IT FOR HIM?

IS IT ROSE
OR ROSEANNE?

ROSALINDA.

ROSALINDA.

WELL, ROSALINDA,

HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT A LITTLE TABLE DANCE?

[ROSALINDA CHUCKLES]

I'M JUST FUCKING
WITH YOU.

Dispatcher: RESPOND

AT THE FOOD MART
ON SOUTH FLORES AND PYRON STREET.

Morning:
I'LL GO AROUND THE BACK.

[MUSIC PLAYING IN STORE]

JESSICA, WHAT HAPPENED?

JESSICA. JESSICA.

WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

HE--HE, UM...

HE WOULDN'T OPEN
THE DOOR OF THE FRIDGE FOR THE--

THIS MAN RAMMED
HIS HEAD THROUGH IT.

IS HE STILL HERE?

JESSICA, LOOK AT ME.

LOOK AT ME!

AAH!

Man: THERE YOU GO.
BEER ON A SUNDAY.

SO WHERE'S
THE BUSCH BEER, HUH?

AAH! AAH!

MORNING, HE'S COMING
OUT BACK.

SHOTS FIRED

ON SOUTH PYRON
AND FLORES.

JESSICA,
DON'T MOVE, OK?

Dispatcher: RESPOND
TO A 10-50, SHOTS FIRED

AT THE FOOT MART

THAT'S SOUTH FLORES.

WE'VE GOT ONE MAN DOWN.

I WANT
A FULL REPORT IN THE MORNING.

YUP.

GO HOME.

OK. THANKS, SARGE.

WANT SOMEONE
TO LOOK AT THAT?

UH-UH. I--
I BIT MY TONGUE

WHEN HE SCARED ME.

YEAH.

Man: WATCH YOUR BACK.

YOU ALL RIGHT?

MM-HMM.

THANKS.

Officer on radio:
THIS IS 257.

E.M.S. IS JUST
LOADING UP NOW.

I'M ROB,
BY THE WAY.

I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER.

I KNOW.

JUST LIKE MAMA
USED TO MAKE.

COME ON NOW.
COME ON NOW.

Morning: YOU'RE MISSING
THE PARTY.

OH, LOOK AT
THE MESS I MADE.

LOOK AT THE MESS I MADE.

YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
HAVE TO COME OUT HERE AND CLEAN THAT UP.

WHO THE FUCK IS THAT?

Morning: JUST WANT
SOME GODDAMN HOSPITALITY.

COME ON.

I CAN HEAR YOU IN THERE.

Toby: OH, NO!

Morning: I CAN HEAR
YOU ASSHOLES IN THERE.

IT'S THAT FUCKING COP!

Morning: COME ON.
GET OUT HERE.

CALM DOWN, MAN.
IF THEY HAD A WARRANT, THEY'D BE IN HERE ALREADY.

Morning: YOU GUYS
WANT TO PLAY?

I'LL PLAY.

YOU DON'T KNOW, MAN.
HE'S NUTS.

THE GUY'S FUCKING CRAZY.
LOOK AT THIS SHIT!

Morning: GET OUT HERE.

Ronald: RELAX, MAN.
CHILL OUT.

Morning: I JUST WANT
SOME GODDAMN HOSPITALITY!

[BANGING ON DOOR]

Victor: I KNOW WHAT
YOU DUDES ARE ABOUT. YOU'RE A GODDAMN COP.

Francis: VICTOR,
SHUT IT. SHUT IT.

Morning: GODDAMN IT!
COME ON OUT.

COME ON OUT.
COME ON OUT!

COME ON OUT!
COME ON OUT!

COME ON OUT!

FUCK! HE'S GONNA
FUCKING KILL ME, MAN!

MORNING.

Morning: COME ON OUT!
COME ON OUT, MOTHERFUCKER!

COME ON OUT HERE,
GODDAMN IT! COME ON OUT HERE!

TED. COME ON, MAN.
GIVE IT A REST.

TED.

Morning: TOBY?

Toby: FUCK! FUCK!

IS THAT YOU?

FUCK!

Morning: TOBY,
COME ON OUT!

COME ON OUT HERE,
TOBY.

Morning: COME ON OUT
AND TALK TO ME.


HEY, TOBY.

Francis, voice-over:
I CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED THAT DAY.

I CAN IMAGINE MORNING,
SO GLAD HE FOUND TOBY

BUT NEVER SEEING
WHAT HE HAD BECOME OR UNDERSTANDING WHY.

AND I CAN IMAGINE TOBY
STANDING IN THAT DOORWAY,

THE ANGER FINALLY
DRAINED OUT OF HIM...

MAYBE FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HIS LIFE

FEELING SOMETHING
CLOSE TO AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

I CAN IMAGINE
ALL THAT HAPPENED...

BEFORE THOSE 6 BLUE-TIPPED
SLUGS SHOT THROUGH HIM.

I KNOW THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD HAVE SAID OR DONE

TO CHANGE WHO MORNING WAS.

BUT I CAN IMAGINE
A LOT OF WAYS TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY.

STILL, EVERY TIME
THAT DOOR SWINGS OPEN,

TOBY'S STANDING THERE.

Man: â™ª YOU DON'T CARE â™ª

â™ª AT ALL â™ª

â™ª FLOWER OF DARKNESS â™ª

â™ª BLOSSOMS BY MY WINDOW â™ª

â™ª AND THE MOON SEES â™ª

â™ª WITH A BALEFUL EYE â™ª

â™ª WHEN YOU'RE DANCING â™ª

â™ª YOU GIVE YOUR LOVE
TO STRANGERS â™ª

â™ª YOU JUST LAUGH IN MY FACE... â™ª

Francis, voice-over:
MOST PEOPLE HATE COPS.

IT'S A FACT,
BUT IT'S NOT TRUE.

WHEN THINGS GO BAD,
WE'RE THE ONES YOU CALL.

WE SHOW UP
AND WE ARREST PEOPLE

BECAUSE, AS A FRIEND ONCE SAID,
"WE'RE COPS. THAT'S WHAT WE DO."

BUT IT'S ALSO OUR JOB
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER,

TO CHASE AWAY THE SHADOWS.

I GUESS SOMETIMES THE SHADOWS
WE CHASE ARE OUR OWN.

Victor: I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING,

WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON HERE,
WHAT SHE'S BEEN DOING IN MY HOUSE.

HEY, VICTOR.

Victor: HEY.

WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO?

THIS WOMAN OVER HERE
SAYS HE'S BEEN BEATING ON HER FOR YEARS.

CAN I TALK TO YOU,
MAN?

CAN I JUST
HAVE A SECOND?

MAYBE YOU CAN
MAKE SOME SENSE OUT OF THIS, BECAUSE--

HEY, VICTOR, VICTOR?
SHUT UP.

RANDY, THAT'S CARLA.
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS,

I WANT YOU TO
WALK OVER THERE,

HANDCUFF HER,
BRING HER TO THE BACK SEAT.

Victor: WHAT?

WHAT ABOUT HIM?

HE'LL JUST HAVE TO DO
WITHOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND TONIGHT.

Victor: NO, NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
MAN?

HEY, THAT
AIN'T RIGHT, BROTHER.

Officer: SHUT UP.

â™ª BUT YOU DON'T CARE
AT ALL â™ª

â™ª NO â™ª

â™ª YOU DON'T CARE AT ALL â™ª

[COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING]

HERE YOU GO.

[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO]

â™ª SOUNDS SO WRONG, BUT I NEED
