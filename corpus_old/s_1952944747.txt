Hi.

Hi.

Have we met
somewhere before?

Mm-hm, I don't
think so.

Mm.

Ah.

Late.

Very late, Anna. You put
the alarm back again.

<i>Stautenmeyer is calling
into the office this morning.</i>

<i>We're gonna talk to them
about making me partner.</i>

Wow. That's amazing.

Yeah, you're gonna have to work
on being a little more corporate.

Yeah, work on this.

Jesus!
Not funny.

Ha ha.

In other news, the serial killer
now known as Tearjerk Jack...

<i>continues to spread terror
across the East Side.</i>

<i>Police have verified the
discovery of a fifth victim...</i>

<i>in the early hours
this morning.</i>

We will continue to follow
the story for you as develop...

Shouldn't you be handing out gold stars
instead of earning yellow ribbons on FarmVille?

I was just checking
pre-delays in the subway.

What do you think?

I like it a little
rough, but I guess...

Mr. Stautenmeyer
likes his men a little different.

No, he does
like it smooth.

<i>Next stop.</i>

<i>"A chance encounter
with a mysterious stranger...</i>

<i>could be a bridge to new
exciting opportunities."</i>

<i>Wow, that looks
like modern art.</i>

It's a little Picasso
we've got going over here.

<i>Whoa.</i>

Oh, no. It's so
not a big deal.

Why don't we get a sponge from
over there and clean it up, okay?

All right.

Okay, got it.

Woo! Woo!

I got you.

Oh, no, you got me.
Oh, no, you got me.

Hello. I am here
to pick up...

Robert. He's
in the sandpit.

Oh, you're good. I don't
know how you tell them apart.

Hello!

<i>Hi, Supernanny. Any hunklicio us divorcee to report...</i>

<i>or are you too busy
potty-training their offspring?</i>

You're so bad. I'm still
on the clock, you know.

So, are you
coming today?

<i>Yeah, it's Tuesday, right?
You bet your ass I am.</i>

<i>No, I'd rather
drink the calories.</i>

Mm, six-and-a-half.

Not too bad.
I would say seven.

Look left
to the bar. Quick.

<i>Ten out of ten. Not too shabby.
Not too shabby at all.</i>

I wouldn't kick him out
of bed for eating crackers.

<i>Or anything else.</i>

Does that matter?

Okay. So, I wanna know how was
Justin Timberlake last week?

Hm. Had a few drinks.
Went back to his...

Need I elaborate?

I had more fun
with a broken vibrator.

Does it ever get tiring, being a slut?

<i>I'll tell you one thing
you never get tired of.</i>

That moment when you wake
up and for a second...

you have no idea where you are or
who the hell the guy is next to you.

<i>I live
for that stuff</i>

I guess it complicates things
a little bit less, right?

Yeah.

I mean, sometimes with Bryce...

No, enough with Bryce.

If you're done with
him, just hand him over.

<i>Come on, girls.
Big smiles.</i>

Just think
in three months...

we will be sipping those dirty
martinis on Laguna Beach.

Hey, guys, I was... I wanted to tell you, but, um...

I don't think I'm gonna be
able to make it this year.

<i>What?</i>

It's sacred.

It's a ritual.

I know. It's just Bryce
wants to take us to Vegas...

to celebrate our
first year and stuff.

Classy.

He's so gonna
pop the question.

Okay, listen, we just
moved in together.

And what are you waiting for? Get
dumped for some skanky-ass cheerleader?

If he pulls out a ring,
you should snatch it, girl.

Thank you.

You know, once you've squeezed
out a couple of rug-rats...

<i>you'll fix up some money pit and
slide contentedly into senility.</i>

<i>Francine, for
a second there...</i>

I forgot why
you're still single.

Oh, my God, you guys.

Mister "Ten-Out-of-Ten" over
there is totally checking me out.

<i>Oh, well, no sense in
letting him go to waste.</i>

Another drink.

Yeah, I know, it's cool.
I mean, he's not hot at all.

I mean, he's certainly
not my type.

<i>Excuse me, between
my nose and my rack...</i>

which do you think
I should get done first?

Major alcoholic. She's
got problems. Come on.

I'm sorry.
Wilcox and Third, please.

Get in.
I'll drive you home.

It's okay. Unlike some
people I know, I can walk.

<i>Are you getting in or what?</i>

<i>Hey, ma'am, lookout!</i>

Hey, check it out.

No!

<i>Anna? Anna!</i>

Will she be okay?

Somebody tell me. They ran
all the tests again this morning.

<i>Look, she's waking up.</i>

Anna?

Anna, can you hear me?

<i>- Hey, chica, we're here.
Are you okay?</i>

Who are you?

Anna, it's me.
It's Bryce.

Oh, my head.

You're fine.

My head hurts.

Nothing is broken. You are
a blue-eyed miracle, kid.

Don't. Don't touch me.

Who are you?

<i>It's us, chica.</i>

<i>Hey, don't you
recognize us?</i>

<i>Anna? You've been
unconscious for over a week.</i>

Doctor.
He's not Bryce.

It's okay, Anna.
Calm down.

<i>i's not him. it's
not Bryce. I know Bryce.</i>

Anna, you just need to
relax. You need some rest.

<i>You got a nasty
bump on your head.</i>

It's all right, Anna.

Please, l-l
don't need that.

Anna!

Don't touch me.

Don't touch me!

Anna! Anna, wait.

She's confused.

Do you think she's okay?

It's okay.

<i>Anna, sweetheart.</i>

<i>Open the door.</i>

<i>Anna, it's me.</i>

Okay. Okay.

Sh, sh.

Take a close look
at this, please.

<i>And this one?</i>

Is that the same
face you see?

No.

<i>Both photos are
of the same man.</i>

<i>What you are experiencing
are symptoms of prosopagnosia.</i>

Sorry, proso-what?

<i>Prosopagnosia
or face blindness.</i>

<i>It-it's an impairment
in face perception...</i>

<i>caused by a lesion
on the temporal lobe.</i>

It's this part of the brain
that allows us in a nanosecond...

to compare someone's face with all
of the faces stored in our memory.

You wanna dumb it down
a little bit, Doc?

<i>Every time you look
at someone's face...</i>

it's as if you've never seen them
before. Even someone close to you.

Even your
own reflection.

However, confirmed cases of
prosopagnosia are extremely rare.

Anna is probably suffering
a slight cerebral shock.

If the symptoms persist, you'll
need to see another specialist...

for a second opinion.

Twenty-dollar
words for stuff...

they know nothing about.
Psychiatrists for ya.

I had the place cleaned
for when you came back.

Thank you.

You know, I really thought
I was gonna lose you there.

Come here.

So, are you getting
used to my new looks?

Are they an
improvement at least?

Yeah, I mean...no.

Y-you look great.

You see?
It's not all bad.

It'll pass.

And everything will go
back to the way that it was.

Hey, at least some
things never change.

Oh, that'll be
your dad.

He's been calling non-stop on
some crackly line from Argentina.

<i>Hello.
Uh, no.</i>

I just brought her home.

No, I understand but...

If you want.

Okay, I'll bring her in.

All right.

<i>Hey.</i>

Hey.

Everything okay?

Yeah.

Who was that?

It was just the police. Some
detective. He keeps calling.

He wants to take
your statement. Now.

Guess you put a
pretty good fight, huh?

How do you know that?

I called your cell.

On the bridge, remember?
I heard things.

I'm the one who
called the police.

<i>Any more internal
memos end up in the Tribune...</i>

<i>I'll personally tear the
son of a bitch a new ass hole.</i>

Miss Marchant, correct?
How's the head?

You're the boyfriend?

Yeah. Bryce.

I'm Kerrest.
This way.

Watch your step.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, don't go in. Just sign
this before you do anything.

Oh, you're wearing
that pretty blue tie.

Thank you.

Would you change this
goddamn cell phone ring?

Why don't you just figure it out
yourself, you freaking loser.

A pasta bracelet. It's all
we found on the bridge.

No bag, no phone. Are you
sure they didn't fall with you?

I'm gonna ask you not to
cancel your cell phone contract.

The asshole's probably not stupid
enough to use it, but you never know.

So you really think
that it's him?

He killed, raped, and wept over the
corpse. You must know how he works.

He's been front page
news for six months now.

They even have
a snappy name for him.

Tearjerk Jack.

So, are you
gonna protect her?

This, my friend...

is what we have to wade through
just to request police protection.

<i>Twenty of these get dumped on
the Chief's desk every morning.</i>

Cops parked outside your
house 24/7 scarfing doughnuts.

Strictly 911 territory.

He's got my papers.
He's got my address.

<i>And he's not stupid enough to go after
the one person who can recognize him, right?</i>

Look...

I'm sorry you had to
meet this year's whackjob.

You wanna feel safe?

Help me catch
the son of a bitch.

What do you got
for me here?

Thirty-five, forty,
tall, dark?

I'm not letting you out of here
until you give me more than this.

Did you or did you
not see his face?

Did you or did you
not see his face?

Yes, I did.

Good. We're
getting somewhere.

Here. Look these
over carefully.

<i>Take your time.</i>

<i>This is bullshit! Miss Marchant, you
haven't even looked at half of these.</i>

I can't remember his face,
okay? Since the accident...

Anna, just... sh.

She just got out of the
hospital. She needs rest.

Rest? You go tell that to the six women
whose throat he cut from ear to ear!

I apologize if I'm
rattling your cage...

but I'd rather the next time we
meet you weren't lying on a slab.

I can't recognize faces
anymore. Do you understand?

Since the accident I...

That-that man could be right in
front of me and I wouldn't know it.

Please, don't waste your
time trying to scare me...

because I am.
I already am.

Call the hospital.
They'll explain.

<i>Hey, Nicky.</i>

Lanyon, I've been trying to
reach you for the last two hours.

Man, it's Wednesday.
Nicholas. No cell.

Guess who just woke
up and walked in?

Anna Marchant.

Dammit, not a
diet Pepsi.

So, what's the story?
You got any leads?

Can we talk?

So, this
face blindness...

is it temporary
or permanent?

They have no
freaking idea.

You think
it's funny?

Well, she's the only one who's seen
him, and she can't recognize anybody?

You gotta admit
it's pretty far out.

How's the kid doing?

<i>He still hasn't
uttered a word.</i>

We have no lead, no ID.
Jorgensen in forensics...

even pushed a trace
on the tear sample...

<i>through the Feds'
DNA database. Nada.</i>

The guy is
a freaking ghost.

You're the mind reader
with the fancy diploma.

You know what I think?

The guy has to kill women to be
able to touch them. Well, that's sad.

The melancholy
killer theory?

I mean, come on. You gotta
give me more than that.

He weeps because his sexual
compulsions disgust him. He...

he only kills so they won't
see him as he truly is.

Anna Marchant
saw him.

Yeah, and she-she survived. I think
he's gonna be really interested in her.

Let me head down the Mission. Have another
crack at that hobo who fished her out.

Good luck. We got nothing
out of him but sea shanties.

Hey, there.

Have we met
somewhere before?

Hey.

I'm sorry.

It was just
a bad dream.

Hey, it's okay.

Look, they need me at the
office this morning but...

Now, if you
want, I can...

No, it's okay. I'm...

I'm fine.

Are you sure?

Hey.

Hey.

You gave me quite
a ride, old boy.

Why weren't you down
at the Mission?

It's dirty there.

Might not be the Savoy
but at least it's safe.

Anything could happen
to you down here.

And what
do you care, huh?

I got some questions and this
time I really need the answers.

<i>The soonest I can get out
is on Tuesday's red eye from Buenos Aires.</i>

<i>Look, I'll take you to
dinner. I'll spoil you rotten.</i>

Well, that sounds great. You know what?

Why don't you come meet me at
school? I start back on Wednesday.

<i>Okay, any delays
I'll call you.</i>

Can you call me on Bryce's
Blackberry? Do you have that number?

<i>I have it, I have it. Now listen...</i>

<i>I wish I could've
been there for you.</i>

It's okay, Dad. I love you, okay?
I'll see you then.

<i>I love you, too, Snowflake. Bye.</i>

Bye.

Hello.

<i>It's us, chica.
Open up!</i>

Hi, Sleeping Beauty.

Know who we
are this time?

Oh, yeah.
I mean, absolutely.

<i>I was just really
zoned out last time.</i>

I mean, I'm...

really fine.

Well, look. You made
the front page.

<i>You're famous, bebe.</i>

God, I got away.

Oh, my God.

In heaven there's no beer.
Let's drink it all right here.

In heaven there's no beer.
Let's drink it all right here!

Look who's back.
Hello, handsome.

You feel
like remembering?

There's a two-six
in it for ya. Right?

Oh. I'll call you.

Or I'll text you.

Martinis at 11 a.m.

It's almost midnight
in Shanghai.

Just drink up.

Nina, you did
not just post that pic.

I look squinty.
No, no, delete

I don't think so!

<i>Por favor.</i>

I'll be right back.

<i>Okay, chica.</i>

Hello.

Hey.

What do you want now?

Do you see anything?

No.

<i>Just reminds me of Europe
After the Rain by Max Ernst.</i>

I'm sorry?

So, what was I supposed
to see exactly?

Well, l-l-l guess if I
really have, uh, proso...

Prosopagnosia.

Yes.

Well, you tell me.

Can you or can you not
see people's faces?

Well, of course I can
see people's faces.

It's just that they keep
changing all the time.

So, you have the answer
to your question.

Cinnamon candy?

But there must be some sort
of treatment. Medication or...

Face blindness isn't something
you just catch, Miss Marchant.

It's something
you lose.

What are you
telling me?

That I'm gonna be
stuck like this forever?

You're gonna have to get used
to people's faces changing...

<i>as soon as you lose
sight of them.</i>

<i>Out of a thousand faces...</i>

one might
miraculously linger.

Thank you so much.

Doctor.

Faces are the bar code
of the human race.

Ever since mankind
went tribal...

we're constantly looking
at each other's faces...

trying to decide whether
they're friends, foes or lovers.

Don't underestimate the seriousness
of your condition, Miss Marchant.

I don't wanna
be late for school.

<i>Okay, everybody. Urn, can
I-can I get some quiet, please?</i>

Great.

Urn...

so today, uh, we are going
to play a new type of game.

<i>Okay?</i>

<i>And we get
to wear stickers!</i>

<i>And it's gonna
be superfun.</i>

Fun, fun, fun.

So when
I call your name...

I want you to come up
to my desk one by one...

<i>starting with
Caroline Beasley.</i>

Now, for this
game to work...

I need you to wear
the sticker all day long...

and don't take it off.
Do you understand?

Yes, Miss Marchant.

Does everybody understand? Please,
keep your stickers on all day.

Charlotte Canton.

Stop. You guys,
settle down. Please.

Caroline.

I didn't do anything!

I need you to turn around I
need to see your stickers.

Hi. I'm here
for my daughter.

Your daughter. Uh...

Sandra.

Sandra. Sandra.
Uh, Sandra.

<i>Uh-</i>

<i>Miss, Miss. Miss,
I need to go pee.</i>

Okay, sweetie,
go pee.

I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of
a rush. Where's my daughter?

Sorry. Uh, Sandra.
Sandra?

<i>Miss, Sandra left
with her daddy.</i>

Left with her dad.

You let her go with my
ex-husband? Are you insane?

I told you not to let her
go with my ex-husband!

I have full custody!
What time did they go?

Was he with somebody? I need
to know if he was with somebody.

<i>That is really,
really important.</i>

Shut up!

I have trouble concentrating
on names, that's all.

But it will pass.
I mean, it will pass.

In the meantime...

how are you gonna watch
the children in the yard?

Or during swimming
classes? With your stickers?

Anna, you're
my best teacher.

But I'm gonna have to
suspend you. I'm sorry.

<i>If you're better by
September, I'll see what I can do.</i>

<i>"Be wary
of appearances...</i>

<i>and an unexpected
invitation to dinner."</i>

Carotid artery and the larynx are
severed, just like the others.

<i>Looks like a match.</i>

Missed him by minutes.

Kerrest.

He's here. He's here
with me right now.

<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. What's going on?</i>

<i>I'm on the subway.
And the bag I lost...</i>

he put it right on the
seat in front of me.

Hold on.
You saw him?

<i>No, but there-there was somebody
watching me outside the school.</i>

Maybe he followed me
into the train.

<i>The bag, you
sure it's yours?</i>

Of course I'm sure.

I might not know people's faces,
but I know my own damn handbag.

All right. So, the guy you
saw, what's he look like?

How the hell
should I know?

It could be any
goddamn one of them.

<i>You gotta help me
out here, all right?</i>

I can't shut down a whole
subway just for a handbag.

Urn, okay.

He was wearing an orange
shirt, a bright orange shirt.

Orange shirt. Thank you.
Where are you exactly?

Line four, going
to Harlin Street.

You need to listen to me. Whatever
you do, you stay on that train.

Make sure that people are
around you. I'm gonna...

Hello?

Hello?

Damn.

<i>Those connecting
to fine two, this is your exit.</i>

Make sure
where you go.

No!

You stay away
from me. Stay away!

<i>What's going on?</i>

Don't move, buddy.
Stay where you are.

What the hell
is going on here?

<i>Anna, you told me
to meet you after work.</i>

I see you running down into the
subway. What the hell is going on here?

<i>Just stand still, sir.</i>

For God's sake, Snowflake.
Why are you so scared of me?

Daddy?

Let go.

Oh, Daddy.

I'm so sorry.

Oh, Daddy.

Sweetie, it's all right.

It's all right.
I'm okay.

<i>Hey, it's Anna and Bryce. We're
not home. Please leave a message. Bye.</i>

<i>Hi, Snowflake. Look,
I'm back at the airport.</i>

<i>Listen to me.</i>

<i>You have to tell Bryce
about your condition.</i>

<i>You can't
just ignore it.</i>

Hi.

Miss Marchant! Hello!

I just wanted to
tell you. Oh, God.

Everything you said...

you were right.

When I was 16...

I had two
passions in life.

Horse-back riding
and opera.

I dreamt of being
the next Callas.

Until the horse threw me
head-first into a brick wall.

The accident
left me deaf...

and I had to rule out
an operatic career.

You're deaf?

Oh, yes, as a post. I have to read
your lips to know what you're saying.

But I can still
hear Wagner.

I just have to close
my eyes and listen.

And you too are going
to have to learn...

to find your
inner music.

Everyone always goes on
about sight, hearing, smell.

But there's
another sense.

A hidden one.

The Japanese
call it "muga."

It's the sense that
allows you to walk...

without having to think about putting
one foot in front of the other.

You lose this sense...

and you will become like
some of my other patients.

Socially paralyzed...

withdrawing from the world
into the safety of isolation.

That's a tempting option.

<i>No, I don't
want that. I wanna live normally.</i>

<i>Every day people
are going to resent you...</i>

for not recognizing
who they are.

They'll call you rude,
forgetful, stupid, liar.

<i>Now, are you willing
to fight back...</i>

with all your might?

Yeah.

To try and try again without losing
heart, without giving an inch?

Yes.

Good.

Then let's get to work.

Allow me
to introduce you...

to Mike...

and Maggie.

Hard to tell apart at
first sight, aren't they?

Take a closer look.

Maggie is a little
paler, don't you think?

Oh, and look.
She had this scar...

on her forehead.

<i>You see?</i>

It gets more complicated when you have
to pick Mike and Maggie out at a party...

<i>among all
the other guests.</i>

Yeah.

You're going to learn to focus
on distinctive markers in people.

A mole, a tattoo,
their gait.

Anything that stands out that makes
it easier to identify that person.

Right.

What's the first thing you look
at in a man, after his face?

My friends and I
look at his butt.

Well, what else
is there to look at?

Right.

<i>Paler in complexion,
small scar on the forehead.</i>

That's Maggie.

<i>Congratulations.</i>

Hi!

Hi.

So, what's this earth-shattering
thing you have to tell us?

The reservation's for seven. Do
you want me to come pick you up?

No, I think
I'll meet you there.

Okay.

I'll see you
later then.

Bye.

Hey.

Hey.

Wait. You...

You recognized me! Holy crap, can
we call off the straightjacket now?

Oh, thank God.

I couldn't take another wacko freak-out
every time I tried to kiss you.

So, this... this doesn't
change anymore, right?

You can-you can
really recognize me?

Yes, I do.

What are you
talking about?

You don't
recognize me?

I'm your best friend.

I do. With your
unique hair cut...

and the red skirt you always wear
when you're trying to get some.

It's fine. But,
oh, God, I just...

When-when-when people are wearing the
same clothes or uniforms, forget it.

They all have
the same face to me.

What about Bryce?
How is he taking this?

Oh, God.

He thinks that
I'm adjusting.

I told him that
I recognized him.

<i>Please, promise me
you won't tell him.</i>

You're lying to him?

I cannot lose him.
Do you understand?

<i>He's the only thing I have left.</i>

<i>Hold it right there.</i>

You mean you get to bang
a new guy every night...

without ever cheating
on your boyfriend?

That's like a
dream come true.

Another drink.

<i>Take one step.
Immerse yourself...</i>

in people's gestures,
their mannerisms.

<i>Watch them until their
bodies become a melody.</i>

<i>Hum it, hum it, until you can
sing it at the top of your voice.</i>

<i>Use all your
resilience, Anna...</i>

<i>but whatever happens,
don't let the music stop.</i>

<i>Hiya.</i>

Oh. Hey.
How's it going?

Good.

Didn't expect
to see you here.

Well...it's nice
to see you.

I'm sorry, I don't
remember your name.

Hm.

That's odd.

I, uh...

usually leave a strong
impression on women.

Okay. Well, see you later.

Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

What's the rush, huh?

Things are just
getting interesting.

<i>Hello. Can I
help you with anything?</i>

Come on,
make an effort.

You know who I am.

Officer. Officer,
that man over there.

He's standing right
next to the newsstand.

What are you saying?

That man over...

Never mind.

<i>I am not letting...</i>

Excuse me.
Detective Kerrest, please.

Hold on.

I'm gonna check
if he's here.

Hey.

Seen any more killers
on public transport?

Just don't move.

What are you doing?

I need to check something.
Can you stay there? Please.

I won't move.

Oh, my God!

I recognize your face. I recognize
your face. It's still your face.

Me? You recognize me?

Yes.

It's the first face I
recognize since the incident.

Do you think
that means something?

I don't know.

I don't know.

Hey. Any word
from the DA?

Oh. Am I interrupting
something?

No.

Are you okay?

Miss Marchant, allow me to introduce
Eric Lanyon, our star pitcher...

ace profiler and
all-round swell guy.

They say it takes a warped mind
to get into a psychopath's head...

but I'm okay.
Really.

Nicky had
another nosebleed.

It's nice
to meet you.

<i>You, too. What
brings you here?</i>

I saw the papers.

I wanna know everything there
is to know about this man.

You're talking to the right guy.
Lanyon knows everything...

about our friendly
neighborhood whackjob.

I betcha can't pinch
a pen from Lydia's desk.

I don't know if he
really tried to kill you.

He has an odd way for asking
about dinner and a movie.

What he's saying is that maybe
he reacted out of self-defense.

Forgive me,
Miss Marchant.

If he really wanted to kill
you once you left hospital...

we wouldn't be standing
here talking about it.

I wanna help
catch this guy.

No. I'm not gonna...

I'm not gonna recognize his face
like that. I need to see them.

In front of me.

I guess it's
worth a shot.

I'd have to run to catch
the D.A. right now.

Very nice
to meet you.

So, what's your
colleague's theory?

He thinks you made quite
an impression on the freak.

Watched him do his
thing and walked away.

What do you think?

About a year ago when Homicide
turned up the first victim...

Lanyon insisted he had the
hallmark of a sociopath.

We didn't agree. We thought it
was a one off, a crime of passion.

Six months later, another
dead woman showed up.

She had an 8-year-old
son who...

found her on the bedroom
floor with her throat cut.

Now he sees the kid
every chance he gets.

I've learned to keep my mouth
shut and trust what Lanyon says.

Sh.

<i>Come on, you can
drop the freaking Snow White act.</i>

You've all been
here before.

Got a light?

There's no smoking here.
Come on, get in.

<i>All right, stand in line
and look straight ahead.</i>

Step it up.

They're all known offenders
that match your statement.

We're waiting on papers
to run DNA checks on 'em.

They're all yours.

<i>How are we
doing in here?</i>

Fine.

Do you think they
could move around a little bit?

All right, we've seen enough of your
ugly mugs. I want you to walk around.

<i>Anybody who slacks up
gets a night in a cell.</i>

I just need to see their gestures,
their-their-their movements.

I know it sounds
crazy but...

If you want to host a dance
class, it's fine with me.

<i>I said move your asses. Now, get to it.</i>

It's not any of them.

Are you sure?

Yeah.

At least we tried.

I'm really sorry.

I-I wanted to help.

Anna.

Good luck with
the investigation.

<i>Sam! Bad news.</i>

Mulgrew won't go for the witness
protection you requested for Anna Marchant.

After the subway blowout
and the line-up on top...

they don't think
she's 100% compos mentis.

It's absolute bullshit. She's the
only witness we've got, for God's sake.

We need to up
our game here.

Organize another
line-up, manana.

Come on. We can't bring in
every perp in the city...

hoping she'll recognize the
inside leg of his trousers!

I guess that'll give you a
good excuse to see her again.

What did you say?

Come on, buddy.
You know what I mean.

One, she has a boyfriend. Two,
there's nothing between us.

Three, even if there was, I swear, if you
mention this to anybody, I will kick your ass.

It's highly unethical and possibly
illegal for a police officer...

to fraternize
with a key witness.

Whoa. It's that bad?

Screw it.

I mean, seriously, can you
picture the two of us together...

arm in arm
at the police ball?

Why not?

I always thought you looked
rather fetching in uniform.

<i>Happy birthday, chica.</i>

Thank you.

Quick, quick.
Look, look.

A twelve out of ten.
Twelve out of ten.

He"s totally checking me out!

So that's what you do
on your girls' nights out?

<i>Well, no, not me.
No, just... just, um...</i>

<i>Everybody's
dancing tonight.</i>

Even you, Bryce.

I'm gonna go
get us a drink.

Okay.

Did you see that?
Totally on me.

Where is he?

Okay, okay, back up.

Give her a chance.

Okay, what do I do?

Just act natural, okay?

Natural?

Okay?
Go, go, go.

Okay.

Okay, okay.

<i>Hey, there you are.</i>

What took you so long?

Which one is mine?

Oh, God. You know I
don't like champagne.

Oh, yeah.

What did they put
in your drink?

Bryce!

No, no, no, no.
Please, please.

Let me see your
notebook. Let me see it.

God, Bryce,
it's just so...

<i>I'm-I'm so sorry.</i>

You lied to me.

I'm just as much a
stranger as everyone else.

Was it me you were
seeing when we had sex?

Answer me. Was it
me you were seeing?

I'm so, so sorry.

Look, this
face blind shit.

I can't deal
with it anymore.

Find yourself another
jerk to wear a tie.

Bryce.

Hello.

<i>Happy birthday, Anna.</i>

Who is this?

<i>Didn't my
number show up?</i>

<i>You really look drop
dread gorgeous tonight, Anna.</i>

I know your face.
I've seen you before.

<i>You don't know my face.
You don't know anyone's face.</i>

<i>If I changed my shirt, you couldn't
tell me from your own father.</i>

<i>You're the only one
I don't need to hide from, Anna.</i>

<i>No, no, that wasn't me. But maybe I'm
that guy there, to your right. To your right.</i>

<i>No, to your right, Anna!
Listen to what I'm saying!</i>

Please don't do this.

<i>You saw me
doing those things.</i>

<i>No one has ever
seen me before.</i>

<i>You're the only one that can
stop me, Anna, so make it happen!</i>

<i>Or I'll have
to make you smile.</i>

<i>Smile from ear to ear.</i>

Please, don't do this!

<i>Such a pretty smile...</i>

<i>it will make me cry.</i>

I'm calling the police.

<i>Go ahead. I have to go anyway.
Your friend's growing impatient.</i>

Francine?

<i>Nina?</i>

<i>Francine?</i>

<i>Nina?</i>

Francine!

<i>Francine. Francine!</i>

What the hell?

<i>Nina. Nina!</i>

Anna? What's happening?

Anna, Anna,
what's happening?

He's here. He just called me
from my phone. Where's Francine?

She was dancing with Mr.
"12-Out-of-10" just a moment ago.

We have to find her.
We have to find her. He's here.

All right, I'll call the police.

Francine!

Oh, my God. Nina.

<i>Anna.</i>

<i>Anna!</i>

Set up a perimeter
and comb the area.

I'll deal with
the paperwork.

Okay. You got me.
I confess.

<i>Come on, you're one scratch
away from a perfect DNA match.</i>

<i>Sam.</i>

What is violet, striped, bloody
and floating in the crapper?

She wanted to get
married to anyone.

Why didn't
he pick me?

The man she was dancing
with, did you...

see his face?

No. Only from behind.

Can you
describe him to me?

No.

I'll get somebody
to take you home.

Oh, Nina.
We'll meet tomorrow.

<i>Here. You take care
of yourself, chica.</i>

<i>Your boyfriend is
not answering his phone.</i>

We're still trying
to get a hold of him.

You said you argued.
What was that about?

He found out
that, uh...

I was faking him.

<i>Bryce?</i>

You're standing
on Bryce's jacket.

Sorry.

It's my phone.

He called me on that
phone before Francine...

Is that the jacket Bryce
was wearing this evening?

Yes, but...

No, it's not Bryce.

I know him.

Besides, he called me that
night I was on the bridge.

That's a little trick we're
gonna have to ask him about.

Lanyon. Kerrest.

No. He's gone, but guess
what we just looked in.

So, let me get
this straight.

He strings us for a
year, and bingo...

we get all this juicy
evidence in one night?

I'll chew on that once we get
a DNA sample on this Bryce guy.

I just put out a
warrant for his arrest.

Until then...

I'm not letting her
out of my sight, okay?

I want her
totally insulated.

I'll talk to the
D.A. about the tie.

I won't get anything before
Monday. You know the drill.

I'll have her back
Monday morning.

Do you trust me?

<i>Let's pack your things.
We're heading out of town.</i>

Rosemary. How are you?

Everyone knows you?

Everyone knows everyone
on Koel Island. Hey.

Good morning.

Just one doctor, one ATM, one mail
box. It really is another world.

Where are the
other children?

That's the whole school.

<i>Mrs. Hayworth. She teaches
all the grades together.</i>

She must be
103 by now.

You went there?

Mm-hm.

Didn't turn out
too bad...

till you had
to play football.

They've arrested Bryce.
He denies everything.

He says someone must have slipped
the phone into his pocket.

We'll know soon enough. They're testing
his DNA against the tear sample.

Here.

Thank you.

How are you
holding up?

I don't know.

It's not just that
people's faces have changed.

It's like...

I had to wait...

until I didn't recognize
myself to know who I really am.

Close your eyes.

That's how you looked when I
first saw you at the hospital.

Please, don't
open them just yet.

I got a call when
they brought you in.

You were out cold. I looked down at you
like I look down at Jane Does every day.

I don't know.

It's like
I knew you.

Even though I'd
never seen your face.

I know it sounds
kinda wacko.

As wacko as not recognizing
your own father.

I can do wacko.

Anna.

Anna.

Calm down, Anna,
it's okay. It's me.

<i>Anna, it's me, Kerrest.</i>

Don't you
recognize me anymore?

You've shaved?

<i>Yes.</i>

Anything that makes the face stand
out, makes it easier to identify.

Oh, God, I was
such a fool.

Don't.

Don't you get it?

It's not you.

It's just a trick of
my screwed up brain!

You're nothing special.

You're just
another face.

No.

It's you.

It's still you.

It's still you.

Hey, Lanyon.

<i>And they're
absolutely sure?</i>

I'll talk
to you later.

<i>The DNA is negative.</i>

Bryce is not
the killer.

Next time you have
a bad dream, I'll...

<i>I'll just
leave you to it.</i>

My dreams.

I can recognize
faces in my dreams.

<i>Hypnotism
is like a carnival mirror.</i>

It distorts the truth
as much as reveals it.

<i>Or it could have devastating
consequences on your psyche.</i>

That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

On the count
of three...

I want you
to close your eyes...

and travel back
in your memories.

You can rewind...

pause, fast forward
as you wish.

I'm counting
to three now.

One

two

three.

Anna, I want
you to go back...

to the moment
before your fall.

<i>Is there anybody
there with you?</i>

<i>His face is...</i>

<i>It's hazy.</i>

I can't make out
his features.

<i>Her impairment
is causing a block.</i>

I can't get
through it.

Not even
with hypnosis.

She knows.

She knows
who he is.

<i>Anna? I want you to
fuse the hazy impression...</i>

<i>with your attacker's face.</i>

<i>Can you tell me if
you've seen him before?</i>

<i>On the street.</i>

<i>Near your home.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

Hiya.

<i>Ask her if she saw him
the night he killed Francine.</i>

Slow the hell down.
I can't read your lips.

The evening
of her birthday.

<i>Anna, was he there
at your birthday?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Anna, did you see him through
the two-way mirror in the line-up?</i>

<i>Yes. He's behind
the mirror.</i>

<i>Who? Who, Anna?
Who's behind the mirror?</i>

But...

<i>Anna, who is it?</i>

I don't know.

<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

I don't know.

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>Anna, what is it?</i>

He kissed me.

Oh, God.

Oh, God,
he kissed me.

Anna, are you
all right?

It's okay.

<i>Lydia, I need warrants on all
six perps from the fast fine-up.</i>

<i>I want 'em now.</i>

Make yourself at home. No one knows
you're here. I'll call you when we get 'em.

Be careful.

Once all this is over...

I'm gonna take you
back to Koel Island.

You promise?

I promise.

<i>What about the DNA?</i>

The tests came back negative.
Four out of six.

None of them is our guy, Sam.
We're just jerking off here.

Fine, go ahead. Flush
your career if you want.

You know what I think? I think you and
Tearjerk Jack have something in common.

You're both in love with her, and
that's the only reason she's still alive.

You coming or not?
I'm gonna check on something.

<i>"The lovers.
It's too late to turn back.</i>

<i>It's time to make
the right choice."</i>

Hey, it's Anna.
Bryce called

and he wants
to meet up and...

and I guess I just owe
him that. So, anyway.

The address of where I'll be...

Hello, Anna.

It's me.

I know.

Only a one-armed man could
tie a knot worse than you.

I caught a cold when I was in the
detention cell, believe it or not.

Hey, I'm taking
this scumbag with me.

Come on.

Watch your head.

Look, I...

I've acted like
a total asshole.

And-and not just
the other evening.

For a long
time now.

And I'm sorry.

Excuse me.

<i>Here's your drinks.</i>

Bryce, you know
I don't like champagne.

I thought
it felt right.

Tickets to Vegas.

And after I squeeze out
a couple rug-rats...

we'll buy some
old money pit and...

slide contentedly
off into senility.

Oh, God. Bryce,
l-l tried.

I really did.

Every time your face kept
changing, I tried so hard.

And you know
what I found out?

That the way you look or don't look each
morning, it really wouldn't matter...

if I truly loved you.

Uh, I...

I really didn't
expect this...

after getting
your text message.

I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.

Hey, has anybody
seen my cell phone?

Bryce!

We have to get out of here.
We've been set up.

I think he's here.

Yo, Columbo.
You got a light?

<i>Five new messages.</i>

<i>Hey, it's Anna. Bryce
called and he wants to meet up.</i>

<i>And I guess I just owe him that.
Anyway, the address where I'll be...</i>

Shit, shit,
shit, shit!

<i>It's Kerrest.
Leave a message.</i>

<i>Hi, it's Anna.
I can't get...</i>

Thanks for letting
me smoke, man.

Relaxed. Not like that pig who
took my smoke at the line-up.

<i>You should've
smacked that prick.</i>

No smoking.

<i>He's behind the mirror.</i>

<i>Come on, you're one scratch
away from a perfect DNA match.</i>

<i>I learned to keep my mouth
shut and trust what Lanyon says.</i>

<i>Whatever happens, Anna...</i>

<i>don't let
the music stop.</i>

Bryce.

Kiss me.

Think, Lydia. Lanyon was at the line-up.
He had access to all the evidence.

The kid was the perfect
smokescreen. It all fits.

No, screw the backup.
We don't have...

Anna! Anna, wait!

Dammit.

Hey, man, where
are you going?

Grey shirt.
Black jacket.

Look out!

<i>Anna! Anna!</i>

<i>Anna!</i>

Lanyon, drop it.

<i>Drop the gun, shithead. It's me.
Don't listen to him. He's Lanyon.</i>

<i>I'm Kerrest.</i>

Anna, run!

<i>Stay right there.
Drop the gun.</i>

<i>You drop it.</i>

Lanyon.

Anna.

Where are you?

Anna, it's me.

Anna! Make sure
you stay hidden.

Backup's gonna be here.

First, there's
a bloody kid...

<i>who sees me off his mother.
You think he'll tell someone?</i>

<i>No. Not a single
peep in a year.</i>

<i>The traumatized
little fucker.</i>

<i>And then there's
you, Anna.</i>

You saw me crying
when that's...

<i>That's not a Howe d.</i>

<i>It wa-it was
a miracle.</i>

<i>You lost all the other
faces because of it.</i>

<i>Oh, no, no, no, you're not
doing your little diving act again.</i>

<i>Goddammit, Anna.</i>

The safety catch.

This, Anna, is why
I like blades so much.

<i>Anna!</i>

Anna.

Don't move!
I mean it.

It's me, Anna.

If we stay here, we'll
make one hell of a target.

Now, give me
back my gun.

Stay where you are.
I mean it.

Anna, on-on
Koel Island...

there's a school with
half a dozen pupils.

<i>You recognize me now?</i>

What did you promise me before
you left? What did you say?

Very good. I could have told
Lanyon about the weekend...

but that's something
only I can know, right?

Anna.

<i>Look out!</i>

I knew...

you were the one...

<i>who'd end
this shit.</i>

Give me the gun.

Here.

<i>I guess...</i>

you will
never take her...

to the police ball.

Oh, no.

Oh, God.

Oh, God,
no, no.

No, no.

Please, don't-don't move.

Don't move, please.

I'm fine.
Seriously, I'm fine.

Don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me.

You can't leave me.

Oh, God.

Sh, don't move.

You'll find
someone else.

You'll see.

You'll find
someone else.

You don't have
the right to leave me.

I love you.

I know you don't.

I'm just another
face in the crowd.

Don't leave.

Stay with me.

No.

Don't leave me!

Don't go!

Oh, no, no, no.
Please, don't go.

<i>I live here now.</i>

<i>The school board accepted
my transfer request.</i>

<i>I can identify each
of my pupils perfectly.</i>

<i>As well as the handful of people
who live here in the off season.</i>

<i>Nina comes to see me
from time to time.</i>

<i>She's still single.</i>

<i>I'm just taking it
one step at a time.</i>

<i>Sometimes I see a face...</i>

<i>and for a second it's
like I see him again.</i>

<i>It's the only way I can
keep his face in my memory.</i>

<i>Mommy!</i>

<i>But when I look
into her face...</i>

<i>whatever it was that let
him get through to me...</i>

<i>he passed it
on to her.</i>

<i>And just when I thought
I'd lost everything...</i>

<i>I found a face.</i>

<i>One face...</i>

<i>in which I can
always read...</i>

<i>love.</i>
