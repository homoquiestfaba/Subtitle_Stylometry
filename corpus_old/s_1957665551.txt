[slow-tempo piano playing]

[children laughing,
chattering]

[music over dialogue]

Hey, Jimmy.
Hey, Lisa.

Is Maggie up next?
Yeah.

Are you nervous?
What are you, kidding?

She takes it on
for both of us.

She's probably in the back
right now throwing up.

Do you want a drink?

No, I'm okay.
Okay.

* And the love is

* Fading

* What I give to you


And our next contestant,
Maggie Shire.


* Come to me softly

* When you say goodbye

* Please...

[instrumental soundtrack 
 over vocals]

* Just come to me

* Softly

* When you say goodbye *

[cheers and applause]


Why do blondes have one 
 more brain cell than horses?

I give up.
So they don't shit
 during the parade.

[laughing]
I just heard that!

Where did you hear that?
I just heard it.

A friend of mine told me.

Oh, that's funny.
That is funny.

Hey, Maggie!

Hey, Mag.
Hi.

Dad.
So where you coming from
 all decked out?

Well, I'll tell you,
a singing contest.

A singing contest?
Did you win?

Hey, mind your manners.
Winning is not everything.

Yeah, but it's everything
when you win.

Get out of town!
She's right. She's right.

All right!
I told you she won.

You won! Damn.
How the hell did
you know she won?

It's written all over
her face. That's how I know.

Congratulations, Maggie.
Maggie, rub my arm.

Come on, rub some of that
winning potion on me.

Come on, I'm losing
my shirt here.

What about my arm
for God's sake?

You're gonna rub his arm.

Don't start that!

Scared you, didn't I?
I'll scare you.

Too late, she touched me.

Good for you.

Yeah, wish you could
have been there.

I saved a seat for you,
but apparently you had
other plans.

Well, the game.

Yeah.

It's okay.

Okay, king's bet.
All right, all right.

Come on, put your money up.

Lay it up here.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, grandma!

When you were winning,
you weren't in such a rush.

Yeah, well, you know?
Today, will you?

I like it.
I like it. It's funny.

Bye, Dad.
I'm going over to Jimmy's.
I'll see you in the morning.

Bye, guys.
Take care, Maggie.

Touch me, Maggie,
before you go.
Just touch the fingers.

You be careful.

I've been doing a lot
of thinking lately.

It's like for the first
time in my life,

I feel like I'm in control,
that I know what I want.

It's always been
so confusing before.

But now I know that

I want you.
I want you in my life.

What are you saying?

I think what I'm saying
is that

I want us to discuss,
you know, our future.

Well, that's good, Jimmy,
because I've been thinking
about the future, too.

Yeah?
Yeah, I think it's time
 we move out of this town.

What do you mean move out?
To where?

New York City.
What are you, nuts?

I know it sounds crazy,
but if I wanna make it
as a singer,

I really don't have a choice.
Wait, wait, wait. Make it?

Since when did this happen?
Since recently.

You're right when you said
it's time. It is time.

It's time for me to be happy.

What the hell
does that mean, Maggie,

"time for you to be happy?"
What does that mean?

It means going after
my dream.

Your dream.
So you win one contest?

Give us some time, Maggie.
We don't need time.

Yeah, we do need time.

We need time for this
stupid idea of yours
to disappear.

You're more terrified
than you can possibly imagine.

But you gotta understand
that I've gotta do this.

Don't you think you're
being a little selfish?

What?

I'm talking to you
about spending the rest
of our lives together here

in this town,
about raising kids,

here in this town.

And you're going off
about some bullshit idea.

Why don't you just give
this a serious thought?

I thought about it, okay?

New York City would
eat you alive.

And you ain't got
what it takes to make it.

Yeah, I'm real sorry, okay?

But somebody had to tell
you the truth. It's for
your own good, Maggie.

To hell with you.

Just trying to spare
you some grief, Maggie.

Daddy.

I'd like
to talk to you.

What's on your mind?

I wanna borrow some money.

Daddy, you listening?

Money for what?

I'm moving to New York City.

Sure you are. [laughs]

No, I'm serious.
I'm ready to move.

You wanna move out?

Well, yeah, I have to.

I have to be where
the industry is.

What industry?

Music.

I don't expect you
to understand any of this.

Just trust me that
this is something
that I need to do.

This is all complete nonsense,
and you know it.

Why is it nonsense?
Because it's something I want?

If it's something I want,
you'll be sure to
take it from me.

That's enough.
You know what? Never mind.

I don't need your help.
I don't need anybody
else's help.

I'll save my own money.

So that's it.
That's what I had to tell you.

I'll be on my way soon.

On your way to where?

Somewhere, anywhere.

I don't care as long as
it's somewhere other than here.

And you're certain
you're ready for this, huh?

Yeah, I'm looking
for an apartment today.

Today?

You think you're just gonna
traipse in there, sign
on the dotted line,

they're gonna hand
you a set of keys?
It doesn't work that way.

You're also gonna need
down payments of some kind,
security deposits,

things like that.

You're not prepared
for something like this.

Well, why do you think
I'm asking you for the money?

But, please, forget it.

I'll figure it out
on my own.

Hey, the anniversary
of mom's death is coming up,

and I'll bet you that's
what this is all about.

No, that's not it.

I just think that it'll
be best for both of us

if I leave.

Well, this should do it.

Thanks.

So guess I'm ready.

That you are.

So I'll try to get
back to visit soon.

Good.

Okay.

 Dear Mom, I started 
 out this afternoon

saying goodbye 
 to dad and heading 
 off to New York City.

But something stopped me. 
 I couldn't do it.

So I just drove and drove,

literally going to 
 where the road led me.

I ended up in Brownsville.

I figure I'll settle here 
 for a few months until 
 I get my footing.

This apartment building,
Mr. Nutso, does not
allow animals.

So if I find out that
that cat belongs to you,

so help me, I'm gonna throw
you both out on the street,

'cause I don't want
any part of it.

Animals cause fleas,
and fleas cause irritation.

Excuse me.
Sure.

And I wanna tell you,
if I see that cat,

I'm gonna twist its
annoying, agitating
head right off myself.

I assume I'm making
myself perfectly clear.

You are an inferior person

to judge a cat.

Me inferior? Ha!

Be gone.

Oh, good afternoon, ma'am.

Good afternoon.

[cat meows]
Come here, cutie.
 Come here, cutie.

Come here. Come here.

Aww, it's not safe for you 
to wander around the halls.

No, it's not, huh?

You wanna go home
to your daddy, huh?

Yeah, hey, I got
a little secret for you.

If you see a bad man
and he's yelling at you,

you run your little
ass off, okay?

Come here. Come on.

We'll go to daddy.

Oh, yeah.

Okay. [taps door]

Now what do you-- oh!
No, it's okay.

Why, hello, pretty.
 Come here, honey.
I'm sorry.

I'm Maggie.
I called you about
the room for rent.

Oh, yes, yes, yes.

Well, please come in
and join me for a snack.

Cookies.
I'm not hungry.

Oh. All right, then.

Peanut butter?

It's my favorite.

Actually, I make these
much better than
the sugar ones.



You rang on the right day.
That's for sure.

Yeah.
Come on in.

or low-fat?

Regular.
Okay.

Come on in.
Come on in. Sit down.

The name's Rachel.

Hi, I'm Maggie.
Maggie. Pleasure.

Here. Sit down.

Oh, Maggie.

Listen, do you like that

kind of soft cheese

that's in a can?
No.

Me neither.

Why do you ask?

It was on sale
and I bought some.

Then when I prepared
the menu for tonight,

I remembered I can't stand
that damn orange goo.

I'll just do away with it,

and I'll have plain
butter noodles instead.

There. That's for you.

Yeah. [laughs]


Mmm! This is good.

They are quite good,
aren't they?

So...

can we talk
about the room for rent?

Oh, yes, yes, of course.

So I do have a job.

Oh, that's nice.

So how much is it?

How much would you
like it to be?

How much would I like it
to be?

$300.

How about $500?

$500.
All right, $300.

Really? That's great.

Can I see it?

Now? We're snacking.

We're snacking?

Yeah.

Okay, well,
how about you snack

and I'll look?

Where is it?

It's just the other side
of that area rug there.

The door's straight ahead.
Okay.

Whoa.

You can't be serious.
What?

After I tidy it up,
it'll be quite comfortable.

I don't know.
$250.

Half off the original
asking price.

Okay. $250.
$250 it is.

But I stand firm!

Sounds perfect.

Mm-hmm.

I'll be right back.

No, I think we can
salvage this one.
Let me see it.

[cork pops]
[man] Ah!

See? No problem.

Sir, that's okay.
I can get you another bottle.

No, I wouldn't dream
of putting you through
that again.

Sir, if you'd like,
I'll have another waiter
open the bottle for you.

I apologize.
That's not what I meant.

This bottle will
be just fine.

Okay, well,

are you ready to order
or can I give you a few minutes?

Have you been
working here long?

How about I give you
a few minutes?

I'm Tom.

I'm Maggie.

Hello, Maggie.

You're very charming.

Charming.

* It's your day today

* It's your day today

* It's your day today,
child *

* It's her day today

* It's your day

* Dear Rachel!

* It's your day today! *



[laughs]
[knock on door]

Oh! You've arrived!

Good. Come on in.
Come on in.

Good, good, good, good.

You're just in time
for the party.

Hey, how's it look, huh?

Here's your hat.

It's cake time!
It's cake time!
It's cake time!

Come on! Come on!

So what kind is it?

Strawberry shortcake
was chosen for this occasion.

It's my favorite.
Oh, good! Good.

Care for the vanilla
or strawberry ice cream?

Vanilla.
Oh, vanilla?

As you wish.
As you wish.

There we go.

Here we go.

Get rid of these.
There.

So how old are you?

I'm 109 years old.

Wow. You look
great for 109.

You don't look so bad
for 47.

Thanks.

So do you have any children?

Yes, Miss Nosy Pants,
I do.

I have a daughter.
Much older than you.

Does she live around here?

Haven't any idea.

Will you be having
much company?

I mean, since we'll
be cohabitating,

it's legitimate
for me to ask.

No, you don't need
to worry about that.

I don't know anybody
around here.

I want to give
you my schedule

so as not to create
any confusion, all right?

Now between the hours
of 4:00 and 5:00

is my hour of dance.

Between the hours
of 5:00 and 6:00
is my hour of activities.

Now so you know,
I dance alone,

and I wish not
to be disturbed.

However, you may join me
in activities

if under the rare occasion
you should beat me
at one of my games,

you will have the option
the following day of
joining me at dance.


Thank you so much
for the cake.

I think I'm gonna
start unpacking now.

Hey, Bill,
mind your manners there.

Bill's a great name
for a cat.

No, I disagree.

Bill is not a great name
for a cat.

Bill is a great name
for a man.

However,
if I must be misnamed,

then by golly I'd feel
a bit better misnaming
something else in return.

Only difference is that cat
don't give a damn what
his name is.

So nobody gets hurt,
and now I feel better.

I'm sorry.
Are you misnamed?

I don't think you've told me
your first name.

My name is Rachel.

Folks don't know me well
call me Mr. Rachel.

But I am Rachel.

Well, happy birthday, Rachel.
Well, thank you

and welcome
to your new home, Maggie.

Whoa.

[TV playing]
Gee, isn't that funny.

Hey, no, no, no,
 don't strain yourself.
Oh!

Maggie, Maggie.

Look at that hat
she's got on her head.

Look at the grapes
on her...

And he's eating one of them.

Dear Mom,

I moved in 
 with my new roommate.

He's a crazy 
 old man named Rachel.

I feel so alone tonight 
 that I miss you more than ever.

[all laughing]

I love you.

Margaret.

So is that a good place?

You're talking about clubs,
so it depends what you're into.

Gimme a minute.

Hi.
Hi.

You're here alone.

No.

Where's your friend?

He's right there.

Hey, you, get lost!


Ted, your mother's calling.
 Come on!
No.

I'm really getting tired
Leave her alone.

of you.
Go away, scat. Scat.

All right.

What was that all about?

Got crabs
from him last week.

He ain't worth it.
Trust me.

Crabs?

I'm Julia.
I'm Maggie.

It's nice to meet you,
Maggie. Haven't seen
you around before.

I just moved here
from Portage.

Well, we have got ourselves
one small town girl.

You better be more careful.

Hey, can I buy you a drink?

Bobby, this doll's
buying me a drink.

Two Buds.
[Julia growls]


Yeah, a Bud and--
He knows.

Make it a double.

Who's that?
You don't wanna know.

Yes, I do.

Well, I guess you gotta
learn for yourself.

His name is Nick.
Nick.

Yeah, listen,
Nick may take some time,

and Ted, he's too sleazy.

Let's see who else
we got here.

Oh, here we go.
My associate.

No, you don't have to do this.
I don't care to meet anybody.

I want you to meet Maggie.

Hi, Maggie.
Hi.

His name's Cory.

I gotta make a call.

You wanna play a game?
Sure.

So how do you know Julia?

I don't. We just met.

Are you two friends?
No, we work together.

You should come by sometime.

So what are we playing?

Nine ball.
Oh, okay.

You break.
Okay.

Whoo-hoo!

Whoo! Oh, I wish you'd
accept my challenge.

Maybe. I'm just observing
your technique for right now.

Technique?
[blows raspberries]

Talent! Talent.

Number two ball
off right bumper

into number two pocket.

Whoa-ho-ho!

Okay, one hop in the cage.


Perfect! I win.

Maggie, I'll let you in
on a little secret of mine.

Discipline is the key
to my success.

Every day one must work
at it.

Every day.

Here we go.
Here we go.

Whoa. Yay!

Whoa!

I'm gonna play.

Glad to hear it.

Don't be nervous.

Okay.

Good.

Ooh!
[Rachel laughs]

I wanted to ask you
about those statues.

Maggie.

Those are my guardian angels.

Your guardian angels?

You poor thing.
What?

Activities are over.

We need to talk.

What?

Don't you know
where yours is?

No, I don't know
where it is.

I don't even know
what it is.

What? Tell me.
The suspense is killing me.

Maggie, dear,
this is very serious.

I am pained to see

that you are not
in communication
with your angel.

An angel watches over you.

An angel would help mend
that broken heart of yours.

Why would you say that
I have a broken heart?

Maggie. Maggie.
Maggie. Maggie.

How do you know you're okay?

How do you know, by golly,

it's okay to cross the street,
to fall in love

if you don't have
somebody right there?

Right there.

I don't know.
I guess I don't.

I'm gonna tell you a story.

I married my Helen
because of him.

And what would I have
done without her?

Tuesday,

December 1, 1946

I was led to the most
beautiful woman in the world.

Yeah, I was delivering
parcels

for a very large company,
with many, many workers,

but it was I who was
given her package.

Yeah, she lived
on the seventh floor

of a really
quite charming building.
There was no elevator.

I had to run up
seven flights,

and by the time I reached
the landing,

I had to stop
to catch my breath.

I was gasping and gasping.

When she opened the door,

I laid my eyes on her.

Pow!

My breath was taken away.

I was hit by his arrow.

A pinch of pain

I felt in my heart was him.

I couldn't move.

Yet, I never felt so alive
in my life.

If he hadn't been there,
it would never have happened.

It would never
have happened.

How could you deprive yourself
of such wonderfulness?

I don't know.

We must see

that you are protected

and watched over.

You deserve it.

Hmm.

All right,
speak your minds now.

Which one of you wants

to take on the challenge
of this virgin of life?

Hmm?

A match

made in heaven.

Maggie May!
Hey, how you doing?

Ever been called
 "Maggie May" before?
No, never.

You're the first.
* Maggie!

I know. I know.
I know it inside and out.

I'm gonna make
you my special.

Oh! What is this place?

You gotta check it out.

Here you go.
Thanks.

Mmm.
[laughs]

Enjoy the buzz.
[both laugh]

Hey. Hey.

How you doing?
Hey.

How are you?
Exceptionally well,
 thank you.

What are you listening to?

It's my daily dose
of Oscar Brown Jr.

Ooh, look at all
these albums.

Wow.
Yeah.

We got albums there that'll
never be remastered.

I mean, you can listen
to Jimmy Drew
or Floyd Council

or Wink Martindale,
if you're in the mood

for a little bullshit
religious entertainment.

We got records here
that you'll never
find anywhere.

Where'd they get them?
I've been collecting them
 my whole life.

I own the place.
You do?

Yeah, people come in,
they drink coffee

and they listen
to some music.

What a great idea.
Yeah.

A lot of the classics
have been remastered,

but we got pretty much
a lot of everything.

So what do you like?

I don't know if I'd
know most of these,
I'm embarrassed to admit.

Yeah, so, what?
You're not really
a music lover?

I am. I am.
Music is my life.

I love to sing.
I'm inspired by
Aretha Franklin,

but I don't have much
knowledge of anyone
besides her.

Are you serious
about your singing?

Yes, I am.

So how about Thelma Jones,

Barbara McNair,

Big Mama Thornton?

Buffy Sainte-Marie,
Dinah Washington?

Do you know any of these?
No.

God. Wow!

You are about

to receive a slice
of heaven.

Just you sit
right down there.

And enjoy the ride.
Here you go.

Okay.

My God!
What?

It's invisible.
What?

It's invisible.
The damn thing is invisible.

That's just its symbol.

You don't carry the symbol
around with you.

I thought that was
obvious. Jeez.

So what's wrong with Cory?

Nothing. He's a nice guy.

That's it, isn't it?
He's too nice.

What's that supposed
to mean?

That's why you don't like him.
He's a nice guy.
I know your type.

You are making all this up.
You realize that?

So are you gonna explain
the clothes and the get-up?

'Cause you look nice.
That's the idea.
 I got a date.

All right, the plan is
I look absolutely smashing.

I get him all excited,

treat him like shit
the entire night.

Whoo! Healthy relationship.
Good for you.

I gotta go.
I don't wanna keep
him waiting.

Oh, heaven forbid. Bye.
Bye.

* He's so crazy

* Yeah, he's crazy

* About our love...

Hey.
Hey.

Dinah Washington.

For the home,
Dinah Washington,
for the car.

Dinah Washington
for your soul.

Awww. I can't thank you
enough for this, Cory.

No problem. That's fine.

Listen, I'm about to close up.
You wanna play a game of pool?

No, actually,
I'm kind of tired.

I think I'm just gonna
go home and get some sleep,

but I'll take a rain check.

Okay,
I'll hold you to it.

Okay, thanks.
Yeah.

See you later.

[telephone ringing]

Now how does this thing work?

Hello.

Hello. Is Maggie there?

No, she's not. 
 Who is this?

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I know who this is.

Trickery will get you nowhere,
my pasta eating friend.

What?  
Whether I have a cat,
 whether I have a roommate,

or whether I dance
in the nude till dawn,

it's of no business of yours.

Who is this?

Oh, well,
I beg your pardon.

You are speaking to the man
of the house,

as if you didn't know.

What man? I thought she lived
with a Rachel.

I am Rachel and she does--

or perhaps does not
live with me.

Now you own up
to your identity.

This is her father.

Oh, can I take a message,
please?

No message.

Oh.

* Somebody's in trouble *

Hello, Maggie.
Hi, Tom.

Thank you.

That's a beautiful outfit.

Thanks.

So it took you a while
to call, but I'm awfully
glad you did.

Are you hungry?
Actually, I am.

Thank you.

[waiter] Enjoy your meal.
[Tom] Thank you.

Just a minute.

Beautiful.

What's this for?

It had you written all
over it. You like it?

I love it.

Truth is I had
a dream about you

and you were wearing
a hat just like that one.

I had to see you
with it on.

Are you disappointed?

Not at all.

Would you like to hear
about my dream?

Not particularly.

I would like to take you
somewhere tomorrow afternoon.

Are you available?

I suppose.

Good.

Where are we going?

It's a surprise.

Mr. Roscoe.
Hello, Douglas.

Douglas, I'd like you
 to meet Maggie.
How do you do?

Maggie, this is
 my friend Douglas.
How do you do?

They've only been going
about 15 minutes.

How's Albert?
Good.
 Yeah, he's doing great.

Thanks for asking,
Douglas,

and thanks for this.

Anytime, Mr. Roscoe.

I'm gonna be home the night
of the performance

so the best
I could do is rehearsal.

It's beautiful.


God bless you.
That's all right.

I'm only allergic
to a few things.

What are you allergic to?

Milk and perfume.
You must be wearing some.

I am. I'll try
to remember that.

I'd appreciate that.

So who's Albert?
My son.

How long have you
 been divorced?
Three years.

Oh, my, you look nice.

Thank you.
So do you, by the way.

Thank you.

Oh!

Rent.

You know, whenever a woman
tried to give me money,

I'd always say,
"Put your money away,"

or "I could never
take your money."

But I always did.

What a surprise.

Okay, come on, get up.

I'm gonna take you
on a picnic.

On a what?
A picnic.

A picnic, come on.
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

It's good.
Come on, come on.

Come on! Picnic, picnic.

All right, come on. [grunts]
Whoopee! Whoopee!

* We're going on a picnic,
we're going... *

* One bright day 
* In the middle of the night

* In the middle of the night 
* Two dead boys--

Two dead boys? That doesn't
sound like much fun.

Come on!
Come on, what?

It's a song.
Go on.

* One was blind
and the other couldn't see *

No, no, that's
not happy enough.
Go back to the girl.

* So they got a dummy
for a referee... *

Oh, God!

You forgot the butter.

No, no, no,
it's still quite delicious.

Hey, where's the credit
for even bringing food, huh?

Where are your parents?

That's a question out
of nowhere.

Just on my mind.

Well, my mother's dead,
and my father's in Portage.

Why?

Do you keep in touch
with your father?

Not since I moved in.

Why's that?

My father and I never
got along too well,

and, yes, I have tried
to work it out,

but nothing ever changed
so it's part of the past now.

And I'm over it.

Uh-huh.

Well...

I'm gonna have
a little talk with him.

You know?

Find out what's going on.

Hey, you're still there.
It's hotter than
 the devil today.

Fan's not helping?

Hell, no.
Just throws hot air at you.

Feels like a hair dryer.


Hi.

This is my roommate
Rachel-- Mr. Rachel. Sorry.

This is my friend
Julia and Cory.

How do you do?

Hi. Nice to meet you.

Wow.

a regular arcade. Awesome.

You two play
with these things?

Not in this heat we don't.

Damn hot, isn't it?

I'll tell you,
all you want to do
is sleep during the day.

But when you lay down,
you can't fall asleep
'cause it's too damn hot.

You're damn right
it's too damn hot.

I know.
I agree it's miserable.

It's absolutely miserable.

You know, they do have
these new things now.
These new inventions.

Maybe you heard of them.
They're air conditioners.

Boo.

They make too much racket.

See, smart-ass,
too much racket.

Agreed again.

Okay, well, let's go.

Let's go. Come on.

Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

[Rachel] Pleasure is all mine.
Yeah. Good night.


See you later.


Yeah, that's right.

Leave me alone in this...

in this heat.


Let's party.
Where's she going?

God only knows.
I'll make something to drink.
What do you want?

Club soda.
Yeah.

[rock music playing]

All right.
How do you like the band?

I don't.
Yeah, you do.

Yeah.
Come on.

No way. Look at Lisa.

[music continuing]

Hello.
All right, listen up.

We have with us
a special guest.

She's only in town
for one night.

She's only got time
for one song

'cause she's gotta catch
a plane to go to London.

You've heard about her
for years, so come on, man,

put it together
for Rod Stewart's "Maggie May!"

[heart beating]


[sound effects over dialogue]

[heart beating]


[no audio]

Maggie!
Get away from me!

Calm down.
Calm down? How could
 you do that to me?

What are you getting off
about, man? I did you a favor.

You call that a favor?

Yeah, you're a singer.

So what's the big deal
about singing a song?

I give you an opportunity
thinking you can make
a gig out of it.

So yeah,
I think that's a favor.

Yeah, but I wasn't prepared.
The band wasn't prepared.

You can't just throw me up
on stage like that.

It was the wrong crowd.
I was terrified.

I guess I'm just an idiot
for thinking a singer sings.

I guess it takes more
than the right mood.

You know what?
You're probably right, Maggie,

'cause every time
I try to help out,
I screw it up.

I wouldn't expect someone
like you with your little
perfect life to understand.

Man, you have not
even lived through half

of what I have lived through.

I would have killed
to have somebody go out
of their way for me.

You know what?
You probably just expect it.

Yeah, all right,
I'm the asshole.

I'm always the asshole.


Sweetheart.

Mom.


It's okay.

Everything's gonna be okay.

Is it?

Mom?

[music over dialogue]

[music over dialogue]

You know, I think some
of what Julia said is true.

I should wanna sing
no matter what,

and I shouldn't care
what anybody thinks
about me.

You shouldn't be
able to shut me up

and the thought
of what people think
just paralyzes me.

I'm so embarrassed
that you had

to see me walk off stage
like a scared little jackass.

Don't--
Don't even think about that.

Look, you have chosen
a difficult path,

where extremely high hills

and very deep valleys
just come with the territory.

What happened last night
was part of the ride.

True story.

'81. Rolling Stones
are at the L.A. Coliseum.

80,000 in attendance.
Prince opens for them.

The crowd hates him.

And not only is he
mercilessly booed,

but they threw anything
and everything at him.

I mean, 80,000 people
simultaneously wanted
that man off the stage.

So what did he do?
He got the hell
 off the stage.

Interestingly enough,
a reviewer wrote that
if he was capable

of upsetting that many
people, he must have
been onto something.

So now you didn't even
open your mouth

and you got that kind
of reaction.

So just think what's
in store for you.

Something like this
wouldn't bring you
down, would it?

I mean, I don't know.

You know what I
really wanna find out--
I mean--

look, I keep my life
as simple as possible.

Owning a store is as much
responsibility as I care for.

I think about getting rid
of it all the time.

Give me
a Terry Southern novel

and a Charles Brown LP
and I'm happy, you know?

Life is too short
to do anything
but enjoy yourself.

God, I wish I had your
peace and simplicity.

You don't, but that's not
necessarily your choice.

Yeah, well, it doesn't feel
like I have a choice.

Right.

Yeah, but if I
was more like Julia,

it'd be so much easier.
She doesn't care what
people think about her.

If somebody booed her,
she'd just flip 'em off
and keep doing her thing.

So you have a few fears.

So what? They're gonna
work themselves out.

What matters,
what really matters

is that you have it
in your heart.

And no amount of money
can buy that.

Look, and you gotta remember,
you could have run

when they announced you,
but you didn't.

You walked up out
onto that stage.

And a lot of people,
believe me,

a lot of people

would never have even
gotten that far.

You're the only one
I'd talk to about this.

You're a good friend, Cory.

My wish is...

to live in the city

because it's so different

from what I grew up in.

There's so many people there.
It's a place--

I don't know.

I'd have a freedom
that I've never known.

Like I could take chances
with my life

and it would be okay
to fail

because there's so
many people there that,

no one would care
or notice.

No one but me.

So why don't you go there?


One, money issues.

And second...

There's so many people,

I'm afraid I'd just disappear

and no one would care
or notice.

Well, why don't we see
what we can do

to get you there
and protect you

so you don't disappear?

Tom hasn't called?
Unh-unh.

Are you sure?
Uh-huh.

You didn't maybe forget
or something, did you?

Unh-unh.

Phone never rang?
Unh-unh.



God, it's a good thing
I brought my cap along.

The sun's right
on top of us.

I know.
It's beautiful out.

Nothing makes me happier
than a perfect summer's day.

Striving to be that word
you just used is gonna
kill you.

You be careful.
What do you mean?

Oh, there's no use trying
to explain, my precious.

You'll find out.

Well, what if I don't?
Tell me.

Well, let me ask you.
What is happy?

Happy is when you
have a warm feeling
in your stomach,

when it isn't tied
in knots.

Happy's when you can get out
of bed in the morning.

I see.
And you strive for that?

Sure.
How?

I don't know.
I guess I try
to change my life.

I see. And in doing so,
do you accomplish happy?

Not necessarily,
but at least I'm
doing something.

Doing something
 as in change?
Yeah.

Let me ask you
another question.

Why are you courted by men,
but not in a relationship?

Why is that?
[laughs]

That's a loaded question
I don't care to answer.

I see.
You see what?

Do you not question
why you cherish such
unavailable men?

Who's unavailable?

Perhaps you should
tell me, hmm?

I don't follow you.

Let me ask you another
question on a completely
different subject.

Do you like the Beatles?

Yeah, I guess.

Now what do you mean
by "I guess"?

Why wouldn't I?
Precisely.

What would happen
if you said,

"I didn't like the Beatles,
never have and never will."
What would happen?

I don't know.
I guess I wouldn't say that.

But what if you genuinely
didn't like the Beatles?

All right then, I'd say it.

You would?
Yeah.

But you'd feel a bit
apprehensive in saying so

because you're supposed
to feel differently,
isn't that right?

You could say that.
Yes, well,
 I hate the Beatles!

I always have
and I always will!

And I'll be damned if I won't
let the whole world know it.

If one of their songs
comes on the radio,
I switch it off.

And I'd do it in front
of a million people
if the opportunity arose.

Try this one on for size.
I don't like Shakespeare.

I hate Shakespeare!

Shakespeare is
profoundly dull!

What do you think?

Wow.

It's all very simple.

Inner rebellion
followed by self triumph

is a gift man was given.

If he doesn't use that gift,
he becomes,

as one may say, depressed.

And I am correct
in saying this.

A depressed man is
an utmost boring man.

You're right about that.
But what do Shakespeare
and the Beatles have to do

with happy
and my bad choice of men?

Relationships are
a reflection of who you are.

You, my dear,
are holding in a fight.

Find out what you are
rebelling against
and express it.

Scream it out loud
if you like. It's okay.

Fight. Fight.
Happy has nothing
to do with change.

Fight, fight,
fight, fight.

Or that thing that won't
let you get out of bed

in the morning
is gonna follow you.

Time you found out who
or what is following you.

Tom.

Hello, I'm Mrs. Roscoe.

[alarm ringing]

[turns off alarm]

Fireflies. Whoo!

I wanna talk about my obvious
bad choice of men.

I'm sorry.
What did you say?

That day in the park
you said some things to
me that I wanna talk about.

You said something about
my choice of men being related

to my happiness
or my unhappiness.

Yes, that. May I have
a cup of tea first?

No, damn it,
explain yourself.

All right!
All right.

What is the question?

All right, I admit
I've crashed again.

Tom's married.

I figured as much.

Why didn't you say something?

Oh, now, Maggie, really?

You would never
have believed me.

Besides, it was
only a hunch.

Tell me why you would
have a hunch.

Tell me why you say
that I choose bad men.

I believe I said
unavailable men, not bad.

I also asked you a question
in that park that day.
Do you remember?

No. What?
Think.

I don't know. What?
I asked you what

or who you were
running away from,

which of course inevitably
came along with you

when you were trying
to change your life.

I don't know. Nothing.

Oh. Nothing.

All right. All right.
Nothing.

Fine. You know what?
I don't need you.
I don't need anybody!

You just hold it there,
 young lady.
What?

You're wrong,
and it's about time
you realized it.

Okay, you have five seconds
to explain yourself or
I am gonna lose it.

You do need people.
I do not.

You do too.
You even need your father.

Oh, my father.
My father doesn't even love me.
How can I possibly need the man?

You've done a fine job
of convincing yourself
of that, haven't you?

But you better convince
yourself otherwise and soon.

Every moment you shut yourself
off from people because you
think you don't need them,

you're denying yourself life.

How could you
say that to me?

How could you of all people
say that to me, Rachel?

You are the definition
of loner.

How many people do you need?
Hmm?


None.

Because there's no one left.

I made your mistake.

Yeah, but you made it
for a reason.

So what was it?

We all have secrets.

It's only now that I can see

that I repelled
so many relationships

in my life that I should
have cherished.

Yeah, well,

I'm not rejecting any
relationships worth having.

So I guess I'm doing okay.
Maybe not.

But you are involving
yourself with people
who are incapable

of fulfilling your needs.

Your father loves you!

It's humanly impossible
that he doesn't.

If you deny yourself
that relationship,

you deny all relationships.
Can't you see that?

So you're saying
that my father

is the one
that's following me.

Make peace.

Make peace now

before another Tom.

Hey, Maggie.

Well, why didn't
you just come in?

I didn't wanna get shot at.

Get in here.

Hey, I haven't seen
a Pirates hat

since I was in high school.
Where'd you come across one?

Yeah, well, you know,

Willie's kid's
on a baseball team,

and I was just on my way
to a game tonight,

as a matter of fact.

Really?

But I mean,
I'll cancel, though.

I mean,
I've got company, right?

No, there's no need
to do that.

I'll go with you,
if you don't mind.

Really? I think
you'll like it.

The kid's pretty good,
and the team if they
win tonight,

they're gonna be
in the playoffs.

First time
in the school's history.

Sounds like a lot of fun.

So how's everything going?

Oh, you know, fine.

Nothing special.

How are you doing?

Fine.

Good.

You couldn't have come
at a more perfect time.

The game starts in less
than an hour and I think
you're gonna enjoy this.

Are you comfortable
 with what you're wearing?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Okay, well, I'm gonna
grab a jacket, okay?

So you never came
to any of my things.

You know, I always meant to, but
it seems like something always--

Always came up.

Like what?

Oh, well...

I can't remember.

Well, I'm asking you
to remember.

What came up?

I don't know.

Okay, I'm ready.

You know, Maggie,
I don't know what to say.

All I can tell you
is I haven't

and I can't be
who you want me to be.

I wanna go home now.

Why don't you stay
 a little longer?
Why?

Well, it hasn't been
much of a visit so far,

so we should at least try
and reach adequate, huh?

You hungry?

Yeah, I could eat.
Well, come on.

So what are you eating
these days?

Is that an indication?
You're gonna die
 of malnutrition.

Well, it's a good thing
I stopped growing, huh?

Have you?
Well, not that way.
 [laughs]

Ah! Spaghetti.
Yeah.

So what are the odds
of finding a jar of sauce?

Ta-da!
What do you know?

Yeah.

So...

I saw mom.

Yeah, she was only there
for a moment.

I want to talk
to her so badly.

There's so much to say.

But she didn't hang
around long enough.

It was good to
see her, though.

I could even smell her.

Tell me, how's this roommate
of yours, huh?

Do you ever talk to her?

I don't wanna
talk about her.

Why not?

I don't wanna talk
about it.

Really, well, what do
you want to talk about?

Well, how's your
singing going?

My singing?
Yeah.

You don't care!
You remember that?

God, you never
talk about her.

It's like you want
to pretend she didn't exist.

You know, that she's some secret
that you're ashamed of.

She was my mother,
for God's sake.

How dare you say
that I was ashamed of her.

She wasn't only your mother.
She was also my wife,

the woman I loved
for 15 years,

the woman I thanked God
every day for having
in my life.

And I don't talk about her
because it makes me sick
to my goddamn stomach

just to think of how
she was taken from me.

Not you, me!

There are other memories.

Oh, are there?

God, I hope so.

You wanna reminisce?
Okay, fine.

Come on, tell me a story.
Let's talk about Mommy
and the memories.

Come on.
You're so angry.

Come on, you wanna talk.
What do you remember?

 Do you remember 
 holding her in your arms,

helpless not being 
 able to wake her?

How about watching
the stillness on her face
as she stopped breathing?

You said you 
 remember her scent. Tell me...

Did you smell her blood, 
 the dirt on the ground 
 she died on?

Stop it!
Isn't this what you want
 to talk about,

or do you want to talk
about what caused her death?
That sounds like fun!

Let's talk about a certain
selfish little girl who
just had to have her way.

How can you say this?

She had to see that pony,
that miserable brown pony.

Damn you!

Oh, my God.

You were saying it to me.

I told you not
to go back there.

You didn't listen to me.

Why did you disobey me?
That was very bad of you.

When daddy says no,
he means no!


Why did you wander off?

Why didn't you listen to me?

Oh, God, please forgive me.

Hey, it wasn't your fault.

It wasn't your fault.

I'm the one to blame.
I should have been there.

It was me that wandered off.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Maggie.

I'm sorry.


Lovely as ever.

Best seat in the house.

This one's for you.

[big band music playing]

Remember it?

I respected your opinion then
and I still do.

You always said more charm
can come out of a man's feet

than out of his mouth.

I appreciate your thoughts,
however implausible,

they occasionally agree.

Here it comes.

[shouts]
[music continuing]

Baby, take it in.

Take it all in!

I am not to be disturbed
during dance hour!

[knock on door]

Go away!

* Lucky hooligan *

[man vocalizes]  
[audience laughs]

[song ends]  
[cheers and applause]

What took you so long?

What's wrong?

I don't feel so hot.

Okay, well,
I'll go call somebody.

No, no!

No, I don't wanna die
with strangers.

Please.
What are you talking about?

Okay.

[wheezes]
Were you dancing?


Yeah.

I was dancing.
Yeah.

You mended your heart.

That took a lot
of courage

to do that.

Come here. Come on.

It's okay. It's okay.

I owe it all to you.

You mean the world to me.

Thank you for your
loving friendship.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Don't worry.
Don't worry about me.

The angels will
take care of things.

If ever you need me...

I'll be right there.

Right there.


Rachel.

Here.

Rachel. Rachel.

Rachel. Rachel.

Dear Mom,

Rachel passed away.

We laid him 
 to rest next to you.

That crazy old man 
 changed my life forever.

Hi.
Hi.

Peace.

Hi.
Hi.

So I brought you back
your hat I tried

to return
to you once before,

and I wasn't successful
so...

All right.
[laughs]

So thanks for coming.

Yeah, this has been a rough
week for you. You okay?
How are you doing?

I'm okay.

I'm--

I'm heading out of town.

I'm moving to the city.

It's a big deal for me.

Wow. That's great.
You're gonna make a shot
at this. That's good.

Yeah, it's time.

We just made up.

So when are you going?

Today.

I'm gonna miss you both
so much.

Yeah, well...

Cram it.
You know what? 
 Can I have some "cram it"?

Waitress.

Dear Mom, 
 I'm on my way.

This will be the last letter 
 I ever write to you.

And what I wanna say 
 above all

is that if it's 
 you or Rachel

or simply fate taking me down 
 this new road,

thank you.

PS-- there's one more thing.

[rock music playing]
