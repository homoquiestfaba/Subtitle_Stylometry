OOh OOh Yeah

have you ever loved somebody that has been knocked down

and then nobody lend a hand to pick you up off the ground

you got to look inside yourself baby,you got to believe

yeah,I'm travellin' at light speed
Yeah

See,I'm running on a laserbeam
Yeah

Come and take me away

and I do a buck fifty on the one way

till tomorrrow I get there someday

see me ride with my back to the past

and my face to the flash

takin' pics on the run way

I'm a model this

Can't throttle this

give us free

ya know how I pull the throttle back

Give us speed(let's go)

I'm focused like a laserbeam(let's go)

scattered brains don't make the team (let's go)

everything that I am

everything that I'm not

put it all on the line

'cause I'm real with it

I don't care from where you're from

I don't care what you got

You can still get it
(yeah I'm)

yeah I'm travellin at light speed
Yeah

up up in the way

See,I'm running on a laserbeam
Yeah

come and take me away

ohh ohh yeah

See I'm runnin' on a laser beam
Yeah

come and take me away

Yeah I'm travellin' at light speed
Yeah

up up and away

See I'm runnin' on a laser beam
Yeah
