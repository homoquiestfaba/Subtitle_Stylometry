<i>they're everywhere.</i>





[birds chirping]



<i>Another kind of worm.</i>

[leaves rustling]
[footsteps approaching]


[breathing shakily]


<i>But someone is dragging me.</i>

<i>Is that you, David?</i>


<i>You have to understand what's important.</i>

[Amanda gasps]

<i>What is important, David?</i>

<i>Why are we seeing all of this?</i>


<i>we all see.</i>

[birds whistling]

to the garden, Amanda.</i>

[water burbles gently]
[birds chirping]


<i>Amanda.</i>

<i>Am I in the garden?</i>


<i>But Carola, your mother, is.</i>

<i>I met her a few days ago,
when Nina and I arrived at the house.</i>

<i>We'd just come back from the river.</i>



<i>and leaves the glass in the grass,
next to the lounger.</i>

<i>She gets up and walks away.</i>

<i>She forgets her sandals, which are
only a few feet away on the pool steps.</i>

<i>But I don't say anything.</i>


what she does.</i>


over her shoulder</i>

<i>and, in her gold bikini,
she walks to the car.</i>

<i>She walks around the car,
running her hand along it.</i>

<i>She doesn't look at me,</i>

<i>but she gets me to stand up
and walk over to her.</i>


<i>Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

who's still asleep on the porch.</i>


<i>We have to start over.</i>

<i>Your first day in town.</i>



<i>Yes. You are.</i>

[singing along to
"Ain't Got No-I Got Life" on the radio]

<i>â™ª Then what have I got? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Why am I alive anyway? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, hell
What have I got? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Nobody can take away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I got my hair, got my head â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Got my brains, got my ears â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Got my eyes, got my nose â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Got my mouth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I got my smile... â™ªÂ </i>[laughs]


<i>â™ª I got my tongue, got my chin â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Got my neck, got my boobies â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Got my heart, got my soul... â™ª</i>

[dogs barking]

[pulls handbrake]


[Amanda] Hello. You must be Geser.
That's right. Nice to meet you.


I didn't want to arrive
at the house on my own.

Of course.
[Nina screams]

[dog barking angrily]

Stop, Bronco. Calm down.
[barking, growling]

and go with you.

[Amanda] Yeah.
[Bronco barking]



<i>I need to understand which things
are important and which aren't.</i>


[Geser] Quiet down.
<i>- </i>[David] W <i>e need to see the details.</i>



It's a 20-minute walk.

And the young lady
can ride her bicycle up there. [chuckles]

This is a nice car.
[chuckles]

It was my father's.

Your father was from Argentina.

[insects chirping]

[birds whistling]


<i>My hands are shaking.</i>

and they're not shaking.</i>



You're gonna love it. It has
a really nice swimming pool. [chuckles]

You hear that? [chuckles]

[laughs softly]

[pulls handbrake]

[dog barking]
[car door closes]

[Nina humming]



<i>She puts the buckets down
to open the gate,</i>

<i>and then puts them down again to close it.</i>

<i>I liked her right away.</i>

Good morning.
Good morning.

Sorry to just show up,
but I brought you water.

Sometimes you can't drink the tap water,

and since you're new here,
I've brought you some.

Thanks.

Carola. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Amanda.

That's Nina, my daughter.


Would you like some?

Oh yeah, that'd be great. It's so hot.


Are you here by yourself?

We came early. My husband is on the way.


They've been preparing
the house for a few days. It looks good.

We don't always get nice neighbors.

Will you be staying for a while?
No, just for the summer.

I wanted to make sure I broughtÂ Nina here.

Mm.

[glass clinking gently]

You're not from here either?

she wasn't from around here?</i>

[Carola chuckles] What a compliment...


...but I am.

she moved her hand in the car.</i>

<i>Her arms, the sound of her bracelets.</i>

[indie music playing on radio]

when she moved in the seat.</i>

Let's go back to the garden.</i>

go back to the garden?</i>

told you about me for the first time.</i>

<i>That is where it starts.</i>

[insects buzzing]

You're not gonna wanna see me anymore.


If I tell you,
you won't let him play with Nina.

Who?

David?

You won't want to, Amanda.

He's your son. He belongs to you.

He used to, but...

now he doesn't belong to me.




A child is yours forever.



[searches inside purse]

mutual fascination between us.</i>

<i>And at times, brief periods of repulsion.</i>

When David was born,Â he was an angel.

Of course he was.

In the hospital, when they put him
in my arms forÂ the first time

I lost my mind a little because...

I was convinced he was missing a finger.

The nurse said
that happens sometimes with anesthesia.

It can make you a little paranoid.

But until I counted
his ten fingers twice, I didn't...

I wasn't convinced
that he wasn't deformed.

[baby David cooing]

for him to be only missing a finger.</i>

What's wrong with David?

He was an angel. When he laughed...

Where's the ashtray in this car?
[Amanda] Here.


That was about seven years ago or so.

I had started to work
for my husband.Â [chuckles]

It was the first time in my life
I worked for a living. Can you imagine?

[Amanda laughs]

but bookkeeping had nothing to do with it.

<i>I'd run errands
around town in a nice dress.</i>

<i>It's different for you.
You're from somewhere else.</i>

<i>Here you need an excuse to be glamorous,</i>

<i>and I had the perfect one.</i>

What did your husband do, then?


Yeah, if you can believe it.

Omar was different.

When I met him,
he still smiled all the time.


Back then, we had two spectacular mares.

Sad Cat and Fine Suede.
They were beautiful.


But the secret isn't in the mares.

The real secret is having a good stallion,

and that costs a fortune.


And I'm not waiting until you sell it.
You pay me everything up front.

Half up front,
the rest when the foal is born.

I'm telling you, I can get
at least two hundred thousand.

Nobody is going to find out.



Prince of princes.

You aim high, Omar.

I've had my eye on that one
since he was born.

But if anything happens to him,
they'll hang us both.

Mm? Three days.
And if the boss comes home earlier,

I want him back in half an hour.

[horse trailer door closes]

Can that kid be trusted?

Yeah.

[horse neighs]

[chuckles] Which color do you like?
[David laughs]

When I strike it rich,
I'll even carpet the kitchen for you.

[David laughing]
[chuckles, smooches]

Eye, eye, boop.

[David laughing]
[smooching]

[David] It's magic...
[Carola] It's magic...

[horse trotting]


Look at her.

Pretty, isn't she?


Look at her.


her tail for him.

She wants him to like her.

Then she'll have a little baby.

[hooves clopping]
[breathing deeply]

Oh.
[horses neighing]

[gasps softly]


[horse neighs]

[horse neighs]

[horse neighing]

[Omar exhales]

[dog barks]

[horse growling, breathing heavily]
[dog barking]

[unzips pants]


You are jealous.

And you're freezing cold.

[both breathing heavily]


[horse neighs]


[door closes]


Hi.

[footsteps approaching]

I'm going out for little a bit.

Keep an eye on him.

You don't care
about anything but that horse.

I'll be back around five, I promise.

I'm sure he'll mount the other one today.

[David] One horse.
[Carola] This one.

[David] Yeah, she's the mommy.
She's the mommy. And this one?

[David] Her son.
Her son.

And what are you? What are you?
Your son.

<i>â™ª Run, my little pony â™ª</i>


<i>- â™ª From the meadow to the what? â™ª</i>
[David] <i>â™ª The meadow to the sea â™ª</i>

I love you.

[David laughing]
[Carola smooching]

[Carola vocalizes]

<i>â™ª Run, my little pony...Â â™ª </i>[vocalizes]

[horse neighs]

[horse neighs]

[breathes heavily]

[tense music playing]

Where are your boots?
Don't know.

Your boots, where are they?
They're lost.


[David] Mommy?
[panting]


Mommy.

Come on, catch up.


[horse exhales sharply]

[shushing softly]

[horse nickers]


Look at what I'm doing, Mommy.
[horse nickering]

Mommy, look.

[horse snorts]
[David] I'm going to drop it.

What are you doing? Get out of there.

[David vocalizing]
[horse snorts]

Are you crazy?

If I lost you, I'd lose my house, okay?
[horse snorts]

Come on.
[David] Pretty water.


Stop it. Stop it. David.
[horse snorts]

[Carola sighs] Come here right now.

[horse neighs]
[David laughing]

I thought losing my house
would be a disaster.

Turns out, there are worse things.

I'd give up my home, my life,

to go back and let go
of the reins on that damn horse.

I never told Omar.

Why should I?

I thought my mistake
was over and done with.

But that night I couldn't sleep,

and the next day I understood...

And it was the worst day of my life.

What do you mean he's no there?
That's impossible.

He's not there. He's not there!

[horse neighing]

[horse neighing]
[Omar] Where are you? Where did you go?

[mysterious music playing]

[horse neighs, exhales]



[squealing continues]

[groans]
I found him.

[horse groans]






Are you crazy? [exhales]

[Carola] Should I call the vet?
[horse nickers]

He won't come at this hour.
[horse groans]


I'll go get him. Stay with the horse.

[horse snorts]

[horse groans]

[breathing loudly]

[Carola breathing intensely]

[somber music playing]

[David breathing loudly]
[Carola whispers] David.

Wake up, David.

David.

[David breathing loudly]
[nervously] David.


[sad music playing]
[panting]


[David coughing]

[David breathing loudly]

[David winces]

[David coughing]


And so I went to the green house.

What green house?

Sometimes the people
who live here go there.

Couldn't you have taken him to the ER
if he was breathing so bad?

No, Amanda.
[puts out cigarette]

I've seen too many
tragic things in this town.

I had to do something quickly.

I wasn't gonna wait
two hours for a country doctor

who wasn't gonna arrive
in time to save him.

There was something in the water
and it poisoned that horse.

And whatever it was,
it poisoned David too.

Sometimes your eyes aren't enough.

I don't know how I didn't see it.

Why was I taking care of that
goddamn horse, instead of my own son?

[exhales, cries]


what I would have done in Carola's place.</i>

<i>Right now I'm calculating</i>

<i>how long it would take
for me to jump from the car</i>

<i>and reach Nina,
if she suddenly fell in the pool.</i>

<i>I call it the "rescue distance."</i>

<i>The thread that ties me to my daughter.</i>

<i>I spend half of my time
calculating that distance,</i>

<i>but I always take
more risks than I should.</i>

[suspenseful music playing]

<i>The invisible thread gets tighter.</i>

[wind rustling]

The woman
from the green house isn't psychic.

She always makes that clear.

She says that everything is energy
and that she can manipulate it.

My grandmother said that too.

about five kilometers by boat.

You go upriver.

David was burning up.

When we arrived,
she was already waiting for us.


<i>What happened next?</i>

[birds whistling]

[Carola breathing heavily]


We're almost there.

David. David. [cries, pants]

Sit down there.

My son...

[David winces]
[woman] Calm down. Sit down, please.

Here, drink this.

Give some to the boy.
[David wincing]

[Carola crying]

The horse is dead already.


It was poisoned.

The boy has a few hours left,

perhaps a day.

But soon, to survive,

he'll need assisted ventilation.

[Carola crying] MyÂ David.

His body is too small and weak to fight

against such a powerful poison.

It will attack his heart.



No, please, you have to help me.

You have to save him.


My David.




If you want, we can try a migration.

There isn't much time,

but we could try to save him.

A migration? What's a migration?

If we can move
David's spirit into a healthy body,

then part of the poison
would also go into that body.

Split into two bodies, he could survive.


but sometimes it works.

Now, drink this tea.

It will help you make your decision.

Drink it.

Drink slowly.

[Carola crying softly]

[David breathing loudly, coughing]

This is the time to do it. Bring him now.

No, wait a minute.

Where does his soul go?
[David breathing loudly]

The other half of my little boy?

[breathing loudly]


...but we have to wash these little hands

very thoroughly.

That half leaves.

We have to let it go.

He won't be the same anymore, Carola.

That's why I'm asking you

if you're willing to accept his new form.

The migration brings an unfamiliar spirit

into the sick body.

But you have to understand
that even without all of David,

you will still be
fully responsible for that body.

No matter what happens.

Wait there.

[thunder rumbling]

Is that water?
[woman] Don't worry.

[David breathing loudly]



[scoffs, exhales]

[exhales forcefully]

You have to stay still, Carola.

If you walk around too much,
you might move things.

Move things?

Without meaning to.

It's a migration.

Only the things that are prepared to leave

should be in motion right now.

[thunder rumbles]

Sit down here.



this is all insane.</i>

And David?

Did you hear anything?

It was almost four hours, I'm not sure.

It was an eternity.
I don't know how long it was.

But do you believe in all that, Carola?

I don't understand.

You understand perfectly, Amanda.

during that whole time?

Nothing.

[thunder rumbling]

[door unlocking]

[door creaking]
[Carola breathing heavily]

[floor creaking]

[insects chirping]

[floor creaking]

[insects chirping loudly]

[birds whistling loudly]

but we have to make sure

that the spirit has left.

The migration has taken
most of the poison away.

It's now split between two bodies.

It will lose the battle.

You didn't touch him?

You didn't hug him?

That wasn't my David. It...


Another boy.

A monster.


<i>I'm a normal boy.</i>


<i>None of this is normal.</i>

Don't be angry, Carola,
but I have to check on Nina.




<i>You're a voice in my head.</i>

<i>I don't even know
if this is really happening.</i>



<i>Will that happen, David?</i>



<i>If this is really happening,</i>

<i>where is my daughter?</i>


<i>You have to see the details.</i>

onto the chair and slides the lock.</i>

Is she gonna take it?

[shushes gently]



<i>What else?</i>

<i>What else is happening
at that exact moment?</i>

of my body from one leg to the other.</i>

<i>Lately, even staying
on my feet takes a lot of effort.</i>

<i>When I told my husband,
he said I might be depressed.</i>

[Nina singing] <i>â™ª Here's where I found it â™ª</i>

[both singing] <i>â™ª Here's where I lost it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Here's where I found it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Here's where I lost it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Find the ring, find the ring â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Tell me where it is â™ª</i>

[Amanda chuckles, laughs]
[laughs]

It's bed time for you.

Come on.

I wanna sing another song.

I...
I...

I...
I...

I...
I...

I...
[sleepily] I...

I... I...



[insects chirping]

did I, David?</i>

<i>I didn't want to believe
a story like that.</i>

<i>Why did I let something like this happen?</i>

<i>Is this where it began?</i>

<i>Is this the exact moment?</i>


if I don't know what I'm looking for.</i>


<i>It's imperceptible.
That's why you have to pay attention.</i>

the details are important.</i>


<i>What do you feel now?</i>



<i>Is it because
the nurses injected me with something?</i>


<i>The discomfort comes and goes.</i>

<i>We don't have much time.</i>

<i>Let's go back to the day
you met my mother.</i>

<i>Don't forget the details.</i>

There's a lovely little dock.

Do you drive?


[Carola] That's great.
[chuckles]

May I?

I love the feel of carpets.

If I had the money,
I'd have them everywhere.

It's okay?


they had to sell everything, right, David?</i>

[Carola breathing heavily]

they had to sell everything.</i>

David?

David?

[grass rustling]

What are you doing?


<i>Did you kill them, David?</i>


<i>I found them floating in the river.</i>


And changing cities
every so often is part of the routine.

Marco's work has always been like that.

With Nina,
it's getting a little harder but...

I've been to places
I'd never have gone to otherwise.

Living in different houses...

I'd love that.

Do you remember all of your addresses?


And where do you work?

I do a bit of everything.

I even clean houses.

But I finish early. By noon, I'm free.

Can you get this?

[chuckles softly]

[Carola chuckles softly]

Come down, David!

David, come down from there!

He loves it.


Making me nervous.

[water burbling]


always told me about this place.

He used to come here
to fish when I was little.

I always wanted to come but...

I never had the chance.

My mother wouldn't let me.

Sending me alone
from Spain was impossible.

Then my father died when I was 13,
so I never had the opportunity.

[twigs breaking]

Until now.

[twigs breaking]

[grass rustling]

San Lucas is the name of the lake.


[Amanda] Do you know it?
[Carola] Yes.

for him to get here and go together.

Yes, perfect. It was a smooth trip.

[man speaking indistinctly on phone]


So when <i>are</i> you coming?

[man speaking indistinctly on phone]

[Amanda exhales]

Yes, Marco.

But you never see her.

She asks about you all the time.

[Marco speaking indistinctly]

We promised we'd spend
more time as a family.

[Marco speaking indistinctly]


Hmm.

[Marco speaking indistinctly]

Okay, do what you want.

We've got all the time in the world.

[sighs]
[tense music playing]

[gate creaking]

the worst possible scenario.</i>

<i>Measuring danger...</i>

<i>the rescue distance.</i>


[scraping in the distance]
[dog barking]

[scraping getting louder]

[dog whimpers, barks]

David?

What are you doing out so late?

Your mother know you're here?
[panting]

David!
[panting]


<i>We don't have time for this.</i>

<i>We are looking for worms.</i>

<i>Something like worms.</i>

<i>The exact moment
they touch your body for the first time.</i>

[Amanda chuckles]
[Nina laughs]

[Nina laughs]
[laughs]

[high-pitched shooting]
[Nina screams]

[Nina screams]
[Amanda gasps]

[breathes intensely]

Sweetheart.

Look...

It's just to scare away the birds.

[car horn honking]

[dog barking]

[indistinct chattering]
[child laughing]

[dog barking]
[sniffs]

[child babbling]

Nina?

[child vocalizing and babbling]
[toy squeaking]

[child babbling]


Abigail? Listen to me Abigail.
[Abigail laughs, shouts]

[laughs]
Not around customers.

[Abigail babbles]
Sorry about that.



Hello.
[Abigail shouts]


[woman] Anything else?
[Amanda] I'll take the shark, please.

[toy squeaks]
[Amanda] <i>Do you know this girl, David?</i>

[toy squeaking]


<i>Where is your other half?</i>

just the stories my mother tells.</i>

David.

Hop in the car. We'll give you a ride.

It's too hot to skateboard home.

Do you remember my name?

Amanda.

[birds chirping]
[breathing intensely]

[screams playfully, panting]

[Nina laughing]

What's this?

[David ticking spoon on jar]
It's an experiment.


Do you go to school?


I miss school.

I didn't know I would.

Do you ever get out of here?

Out of this town?

Never.

[Amanda exhales]

You're invited to come
and play whenever you want.


[owl hooting]


Omar, answer the door.

[exhales]
[high heels clip-clopping]

Amanda. Everything okay?


but the other day I noticed that
David's skateboard needed new wheels,

so I got these.

They're phosphorescent, see?

They glow in the dark. [chuckles]

Thank you.

Hold on. I'll get my smokes.

[Amanda] Okay.
Wait here.

Don't wait for Marco.

You should go to the lake.

Why?

Because this is<i> your</i> trip.
You should do it for yourself.

Then you should learn how to drive a car.

Okay.


You nervous?

You should be.

[puffing]
[chuckles]

[laughing continues in the distance]




Do you think we need to make more?

us together was stretched again.</i>

<i>To give each of us more independence.</i>

["Mujer Noche" by Mar de Copas
playing in Spanish on radio]


Now, get it up to speed.

Super. Really good.

Wow, I'm doing it.
Really good!

[Carola laughs] I'm driving.


[both laughing] Oh!

["Mujer Noche" continues]

[both whooping and laughing]

Watch out! Brake! Brake!

[tires screech]

[Amanda grunting] Ah.

I'm sorry.
[Amanda] Ow. [inhales]

You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. [breathes intensely]

I'm okay.
[Carola] Let me see.

[breathes intensely]

Looks like you hit your head.
Yeah.

You hit your head.



Well, that wasn't
a very elegant finish, was it?

[both laugh]

It was fine.

[laughs]
[seat belt unbuckles]

[car door opens]

[exhales, chuckles]
[car door closes]

[car door opens]


If only you'd come into my life sooner.

If I'd known how to drive,
maybe my life could've been different.

[birds chirping]

[insects chirping]


Nice.



<i>am I going to die?</i>



<i>Were you there?</i>


What a beautiful little lion she is.

I'd steal this little lion for myself.

Those little ears...

These little dimples...

I'll eat them with a teaspoon.

I'll take you while you're asleep.

I'll take you away with me.


I wish I had a Nina for myself.


[suspenseful music playing]


<i>Where is my daughter?</i>


<i>I need you to concentrate.</i>

<i>I don't want to start again
from the beginning.</i>

<i>Amanda.</i>

<i>Amanda.</i>

[insects chirping]


[grunts lightly]

[leaves rustling]



[David and Amanda grunt]

[Amanda grunting]

[grunts, breathes heavily]

[footsteps approaching]
[Amanda grunting]

[Amanda grunt, breathes heavily]

[birds twittering]

[morose music playing]

[water burbling]


Is she gonna take it?

[shushes gently]

[Amanda] <i>I...</i>
[Nina] <i>I...</i>

I...
I...

I...
[sleepily] I...

Nina?

Nina?

Marco, what are you doing here?

Where's Nina?

She's here.


I thought you weren't
going to be here until next weekend.

Nina has something to tell you.

Nina... Come on. Go ahead and tell her.

It's an experiment, Amanda.

Where did this can come from, Nina?

I'm not Nina. I'm David.


Stop it, Nina!


Stop it!





[breathing heavily]

Where is my daughter?</i>

[David] <i>That's not important.</i>
[Amanda] <i>It's the only important thing.</i>

[David] <i>It's not important.</i>
[Amanda] <i>David.</i>


[soft music playing]
[bird squawks]

[water burbling]

[horse neighs]
[gasps]

[horse neighs]

for Marco and went to the lake alone.</i>



<i>it was a journey
I needed to take for myself.</i>

[water swishing gently]


[engine starts]

[brake pedal creeks]

He's in your house!

What happened?
[Carola] David is in your house.

What do you mean?

I stepped out to water the flowers,
and when I came back,Â the door was locked.

[Amanda] Nina!
[Carola] Do you have the key?

He locked both doors.
Nina! Nina, open the door!

We have to get in there.
[Amanda] I left everything open.

He's gonna do something bad.

Nina! Just shut up for one minute!
You're driving me crazy!

[Elvira] My God!
[Amanda] Nina! [bangs on door]

[Carola] He's gonna do something!
Don't say that. He's just a child!

[Elvira] Oh my God!
[cries]


[somber music playing]


Nina!

[Carola] David!
Check the bathrooms.

[Carola] David!
[Amanda gasps]

We were hiding, Mommy!
[Amanda sighs] Are you all right?

[sighs]
[Carola] You found her.


[Amanda sighs in relief]

Nina, what happened?

what happened? I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry. Is everything all right?

Let me take her.
[Amanda] Yes, please.


What happened? What's wrong?
[Amanda sighs]

[Carola sighs] Thank God nothing happened.

This is so crazy.
Are you completely insane?


You have to be careful with David.
No!

<i>You're</i> the one I need to be careful with!
David didn't do anything!

You're the one saying David, David,Â David!

You don't trust him,
and he's your own goddamn son!

[Amanda breathing heavily]

Let's go, David.

[Amanda cries]

[humming a lullaby]

[insects chirping]

[bed creaking]

[David whispers] Amanda.

You invited me.

[Amanda screams]


What are you doing?

[somber music playing]

Go away!


Go away!



[glass shatters]
[Amanda screams]



[breathing heavily]

Marco.

Marco, it's me! Pick up!

Pick up!

Nina. Nina.

Hey, you need to wake up.
Come on, sweetheart.

[owl hooting]
[dog barking]

[introspective music playing]


<i>About you.</i>

<i>And I wonder if I'm part of this madness.</i>

about talking to her.</i>

to be so afraid of you.</i>

<i>I need to apologize
for yelling at her yesterday.</i>

[introspective music intensifies]



<i>Talking to Carola is a mistake.</i>



<i>Don't forget the details.</i>

[workers speaking indistinctly]


I'm looking forÂ Carola. Is she here?
[woman] Okay, let me call her.

Carola?

There's a woman here looking for you.

No. No, I don't know.

Okay, I'll tell her. [hangs up phone]

She's on her way.
But it'll take her a while to get here.

No problem. We can wait outside.

Come on, Nina.

[birds chirping]



<i>Amanda, there's more.</i>

[workers speaking indistinctly]


<i>But there's more.</i>

Mommy, I got wet.

It's just dew, sweetheart.[clicks tongue]

Who's here for me?

Hey!

in her uniform.</i>





We have to leave,
because of my husband's job.

Where are you going?

We're going back.

Right now?


It was nothing.

But wait.

What happened?


It's because of David.

I knew that if I told you,
you'd never want to see me again.


<i>Weren't you going toÂ leave, Amanda?</i>


<i>Nina is going to run now.</i>

<i>She's going to turn round and shout,</i>

<i>"Look, Mommy. The plane."</i>

[Nina shouts] Mommy, look. The plane!

[plane whirring]
[Amanda] <i>We're going to walk.</i>

<i>And I'm going to ask myself
if I'm doing the right thing by leaving.</i>


There are just some days
where things hurt too much.

I haven't thought about
what I want in a long time.

I only think about what I would've wanted.

That's something you wouldn't understand.

Why wouldn't I?

I don't fantasize about leaving?

About starting another life?

About finding someone
who will let me take care of them?


You won't come back, Amanda.

You'll leave, and every year
you'll pick a different place...

farther and farther away.

And I'm tied to this fucking town.

I can't escape
from the things that scare me.

I made my own decisions.

I don't regret anything.

You only see yourself, Carola.

And you?

You never look at yourself.

[Amanda exhales]

[breathing heavily]

You look pale. Are you okay?

[Amanda breathing heavily]

[Amanda] <i>Where's Nina?</i>

What's wrong with me?

Are you going to pass out, Amanda?

Mommy, I'm thirsty.


[Amanda, weakly] It's okay, sweetheart.

I want to have you close."</i>

Daddy?

[Amanda breathing heavily]



Take her home so she can rest.

She'll be fine.

and her fingers are cold.</i>

<i>But it feels nice.</i>


<i>Where does my mother take you?</i>

If I'd known you were coming,
I would've tidied up a bit more.

[breathing heavily]

You can rest here for a while.

[footsteps receding]


[footsteps approaching]


[Carola shushes]

All the lights are on.


[Carola sighs] Go to sleep.
[Omar] He isn't in his room.

[somber music playing]
[Carola] Didn't you lock his door?

and he was asleep. That's what I did.

Great. You can relax, then.

[Amanda breathing heavily]

[Nina] Mommy!


Yes. Yes.

I'll put her on. She just woke up.

It's your husband.

Talk to him.

[weakly] Marco.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

[cries]
[EKG beeping]

Marco, there's something wrong.


<i>It's all right. How's Nina?</i>

Nina?

I don't know where Nina is.

Hurry. Please, you have to come right now.

Do you know where she is?
Who's taking care of her?

[tense music playing]
[Amanda] No.

No. [crying, grunting]
[nurse] Calm down, calm down.

Hello, yes.
<i>- My daughter. Where is she?</i>

The doctor is coming.Â It'll take a while.

Yes, I know.

[EKG beeping]

[grunting weakly]


Nina is sick too.

She's too little.

She can't hold out.

And the doctor won't get here in time.

Do you understand what I'm saying?

I told you I have no regrets.

You think I'd rather
my David were dead, but no.

I'm glad he's alive, I swear.

I have to take her.
I have to take Nina to the green house.

[grunts weakly]

Tell me you would do the same.
I need your consent as her mother.

[morose music playing]

[Carola sniffs]

She'll save her.

Everything will be all right.

<i>She's asking me to forgive her.</i>



[Nina laughing]
[Carola] Whoop.


<i>She wants her for herself.
We have to go to the green house.</i>


<i>Hold on.</i>


<i>Is it happening now?</i>

<i>I can't let them touch her, David.</i>

You still can't see it.</i>

<i>There's more to see.</i>

<i>- Just look around you.</i>
[Amanda grunting]

<i>Look.</i>


but you still don't understand.</i>

<i>Do you feel it?</i>

Mommy, I got wet.

It's just dew, sweetheart.

there's a woman here looking for you.

This is the exact moment.


<i>It's everywhere.</i>

[David whispers]Â <i>Amanda.</i>


[Amanda] <i>Take me.</i>
[Amanda] Take me to the green house.

[Amanda grunting]

[Amanda] <i>Am I screaming?</i>
[water burbling]


<i>You're screaming Nina's name.</i>

[Amanda] <i>What's going to happen to Nina?</i>
[panting]


[grunting]
[Amanda]<i> Can't you do something?</i>

<i>Can you bring her close?</i>




[melancholic music playing]

[David] Amanda.
[grunting, shivering]


The thread.

It... it's getting tighter.

[Amanda shivering]

It's Nina.


[breathing heavily]

She's pulling the thread to find me.

[breathing heavily]


It feels like
the thread is tied around my waist.


Splitting me

in half.


Is it because I didn't see the danger?

The rescue distance.


Is... is this what you wanted me to see?

What do you see, Amanda?


The thread.

[David crying]




<i>Amanda, I know you can hear me.</i>

<i>I'm going to keep going.</i>

[water burbling]


<i>We have a few seconds.</i>

<i>Pay attention.</i>

<i>There's one more thing to understand.</i>

Hello?

[dog barking in the distance]

[door closes]

[footsteps approaching]


Thank you.

I'm Marco Casali.

May I have a word?

Amanda was my wife.


But I think your wife knew her.

My wife left.

What do you want?

Nina isn't well.

It's been over a year.

She's recovering
despite all that happened, but...

There's something else,

and I don't know what's wrong with her.

Do you know what happened?

What happened to Nina?
[door opens]

[footsteps approaching]


I don't.



Somebody has to know.


[door closes]

As you can see,

I'd like for someone
to answer my questions too.

I don't know what you're looking for,
but you won't find it here.

You need to leave.
