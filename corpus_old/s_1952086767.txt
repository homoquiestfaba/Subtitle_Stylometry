and if you go to sleep with her?

What do you mean?

I would talk to her.

This remains between you and me.

Hello?

Who's there?

What?

Is everything okay?

Do you have problems ...

Having problems with your car?

I'm just a little tired.

Did a long ride back.

You should be more cautious.

Are you sure?

Take care.

Okay?

I will.

Thank you.

I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

My car has just gone.

I need a ride.

My car has just gone.

I need a ride.

I saw you just not a lot back?

And you stopped for me?

I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

Oh, damn.

You drove 120 where 80 was.

I did not.
Driver's license and registration papers.

It is late.
The only thing I want is go home.

Is this your current address?

Yes, sir.

And you said you went home?

If so,
would you not be that way?

Please exit and your hands
keep up.

Sir, this is really not necessary.

Legs apart and hands on
the roof of the car.

Excuse me.

What is this about?

Someone had already asked you.

He said, that you behaved strangely.

I have done nothing.

So it makes you nothing,
if I check your car?

Do you have something to hide?
No. I ...

Why should you check my car?

Can you please the trunk
open for me?

Please, sir?
Can you open the trunk?

Is there a problem?

No. I just want ...

Understood. - Ben on the way.

You are so beautiful.

Another pair.

Very nice.

Okay everyone, we are ready.

Thank you.

Yumi, it's fun for your cooperation.

Hopefully I see you again soon.

I knew together we could find.

You need to have good intuition.

And an eye for talent.

I have an eye for beauty.

I know.

This is a special place ...

for us.

Come on, Yumi, take the phone.

Hello. This is Yumi.

Thank you.

Yumi, it's Greg.

Call me back when you receive.
We need to talk.

You love me, right?

You never loved me, do you?

Yumi, you know I love you.

Prove me.

I wait for you.

You may never leave me.

I love you always in mind.

Well. Come on.

No, come on, Amanda!

Come on.
Here we go.

All right, another one.
No.

One more.
I know. I know.

Look at the camera.

And again, we are not a happy couple.

We were always a happy couple.

Amanda, you know that they
nothing for me to do it.

Let's not ruin our day.

You know that I only have eye for you.

Let us but to keep right.

I will always remain with you.

I hope you know.

You'll never leave me.

Forever lasted not very long, or sometimes?

What happens?

What was that?

Why did not you lift me?

Do you need help?

Keep your calm.
Okay.

Excuse me.

Maybe you better off with ...

my clothes.

What you want.

What?

I thought that I heard something.

Greg, are you home?
Speed. Come on.

We gotta go.
Come on quickly.

I call you, okay.

Promise me that?
Sure.

Go.

Who said what?

With anyone.

And? How was it today?

Yumi. Hello?

Can you hear me?

Excuse me.

I was not home on time ...

I would like to see again.

I miss you.

Play a game with me?

If so then ...

Where are you?

You saw what happened.

What? Greg?

I can not hear you.

Hello.

I know.

I saw what you did with her.

Damn.

"Black Lake: 72 miles"

Great then.

Damn.

I bring you back to the lake, Amanda.

I am the happiest girl
of the whole world.

I know.

I was just a joke.

You know I do not
could do without you.

That you also never forget.

I do not.

I gotta leave this body in the woods.

Young whore!

Damn. Come on.

Come on.

Damn!

Are you crazy?

I'm out of fuel.

Did you see the gas station a
piece back is not it?

It's your lucky day.

I have some extra gasoline from
the generator, and am in a generous mood.

Open the tank.

Oh, damn.

Open the fuel tank.

Thank you.

I did not know how long I have
would wander around.

Do not worry about.

Thank you.

This should be enough gasoline to give you
back to the gas station.

Ok!

How much do you love me?

My God.

With such a beautiful woman
what are you doing so late?

This is for you, and your effort.

There is something out of your trunk.

It is very dangerous when
a trunk is not closed.

It may at any time open fold.

Open the trunk.
I get it for you.

No, I do it myself.
Okay then.

Ok.
What you want.

What?

I make sure that you
heelhuids outta here.

You're out of fuel.

There is something out of your trunk.

Whether you are careless,

or you have just a bad day.

Anyway, I will ensure
that you are outta here.

I feel good, really.

It will give me a better feeling.

Well.

Pleasant night.

And go home to your wife.

It will be very worried.

I will. Thank you.

'Sheriff'

Did you not that you going home?

Now I remember.

You told me you went home.

You look so good.

Where do you really go?

Back to Black Lake.

And why you go to?

It is not such a difficult question, actually.

I've just killed my wife,

and was planning to dump her
in Black Lake!

You do not tell me
if you do not want.

Be careful.

That is funny!

Since I now always on,
to my wife in the lake to dump.

This was a very bad night.

You take her to the lake?

I saw what you did with her.

We should go.

It is almost morning.

You love me, right?

Leave me alone!

This is not real!

You are a manifestation of my imagination!

You never love me,
or sometimes?

Go away!

Stop the car!

So, you dump her ...

in the lake.

They will find out.

Nobody knows.
But ...

I know.

Go me murder?

Shut up!

Welcome to: Black Lake
"Black Lake".

Hold on to me to look ...

Hello?

We need to talk.

Where do you want to talk about?

Can I come?

I'll explain everything when I see you.

You know too much!

Sorry it this way
