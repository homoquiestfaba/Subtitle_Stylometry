[PHONE RINGING]


[PHONE RINGING]

MAN: <i>Hello.</i>
Good morning.

My name is Martha Plant,
and I'm calling to see

if you're interested in staying
extra cool this summer.

[CALL DISCONNECTS]

[SNARE DRUM MARCH PLAYING]

[BUCKLES CLICK]

[BICYCLE WHEELS WHIRRING]

MARTHA: <i>If it were
the apocalypse</i>

<i>and I could only save
one thing,</i>

<i>I'd save my shovel.</i>

<i>I could fend off unwanted
visitors and still keep</i>

<i>my planting business.</i>


<i>Not my favorite president,</i>

<i>but I'll take it.</i>

<i>What the hell?</i>

It's been a little complicated,

you know, since I left.

Oh, Carl thought
I was going to hell.

Carl is a virgin.

I've been having
sexual intercourse

since I was 12-years-old.

He decided,
probably my soul wasn't safe,

called off the wedding.

So, I'm just here...

Just...

trying to make right
with Jesus, you know?

I'm not really into that
kinda stuff.

I used to make Carl peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches.

I'd put them in paper bags
and drop them by his work.

He was the assistant pastor's
assistant in our church.

Are those your grandparents?

They're my parents.

You have your mom's cheeks.

I'm adopted.

Oh.
I was left in a trash can.

Maybe God brought you
to the people

you were supposed to be with.

[SERENE INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING]

MARTHA: <i>Mom and dad, in honor of
your one year death anniversary,</i>

<i>I had my first lunch guest.</i>

<i>It was different
than with the three of us.</i>

<i>She's very weird.</i>

[SWITCH CLICKS]

[PHONE RINGING]

OPERATOR: <i>Bridges Hospital
Mental health center,</i>

<i>how may I direct your call?</i>

Hi, I'm calling
about one of your patients,

Sadie Mayflower.

She's sleeping on the street
with a helmet locked to her head.

OPERATOR: <i>Oh, yeah, we've been
releasing our patients.</i>

Why?

OPERATOR: <i>We're closing
our doors due to bankruptcy,</i>

<i>and five counts
of embezzlement.</i>

Okay.

So, they're just out there,

running free?

OPERATOR:
<i>All the non-violent ones.</i>

[MUSIC PLAYING]

JESUS: You know... I know we haven't
known each other for much time

and I'm just a caretaker,

but I like our talks.

SADIE: Me too.

Oh, hi, Martha.

This is my friend Jesus.

I know who he is.

Hi, Martha.

It's been a while.

Let's go, Sadie.

Well, where are we going?

You can stay with me.

Oh, you need a place
to stay, Sadie?

You can stay here at the church.

No, I think you'd
be more comfortable with me,

We have a couple of rooms
in the back.

Nice blow-up beds.

I can blow up a bed for you.

Okay.

Well, if it doesn't work out,

you're always welcome
in God's house.

Do you have any family
or friends in law enforcement?

No.

Any friends
you confide regularly in?

No.

Okay.
[SNARE DRUM MARCH PLAYING]

Whatever happens out here,

is between you and me.

No one else can know.

And nobody can know who I am.

I've been running this
business anonymously

and without any problems
since I was 11,

and I want to keep it that way.

Got it?

Good.

Depending on how this goes,

I may be open
to discussing profit splits.

[ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING]

MARTHA: <i>I have always believed
I'd find the perfect assistant.</i>

<i>Someone who would really
understand what I do.</i>

<i>I bury treasure
for the lucky person</i>

<i>who gets to it first.</i>

<i>Every time, without a doubt,</i>

<i>they compensate me in cash.</i>

<i>We never meet,</i>

<i>but we both win.</i>

<i>It's the highlight of my day.</i>

[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING]

God, thank you for today.

Thank you, for Martha Plant.

For her generosity,

for our new friendship,

in your name, Amen.

Your water pressure
is very powerful.

I think you get cleaner
that way.

My mother
made me take a lot of showers.

We used to be just cold.

That's why
she had me take so many.

Did someone teach you
how to plant?

No.

I like it.

Makes you feel like your worries

kinda roll off.

Because you remember
how little you are.

And how easy
it would be to just

pass away.

I have another job.

I work from home.

So, if you want to be in the
house while I'm doing that,

it needs to be like
you have a speech disorder,

where you're unable to speak.

Okay.

What's the job?

I sell air-conditioning units.

That sounds like fun.

It's not.

Oh.

Good night.
Good night, Martha.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[PHONE RINGING]
MAN: <i>Hello.</i>

Good morning,
my name is Martha Plant.

I'm calling to see if you're interested...
[CALL DISCONNECTS]

WOMAN: ...a <i>nd my brother</i>
<i>just died,</i>

<i>my husband has cancer,
my son can't stop pissing the bed...</i>

Does this mean you don't want
to buy an air-conditioning unit?

[CALL DISCONNECTS]

MAN 2: <i>Can you
do me a favor, Martha?</i>

Yeah?

MAN 2: <i>Throw yourself off a cliff!</i>
[CALL DISCONNECTS]

[PHONE RINGING]

[PHONE CONTINUES RINGING]

Hello?
DONALD: [CLEARS THROAT] <i>Martha. Donald.</i>

Hi.
DONALD: <i>Oh.</i>

<i>How I miss that
pleasant voice of yours.</i>

<i>Do you have an inkling of
why I'm calling?</i>

You need me to do better.

[DONALD LAUGHS]

DONALD: <i>Gonna need you
to do more than that.</i>

Okay. [SIGHS]

DONALD: <i>It's not okay.
You're just so bad.</i>

<i>I know, I promised your parents
I'd keep you on the roster</i>

<i>when I bought the company
from them,</i>

<i>but I can't do charity
work anymore.</i>

<i>Now, I had you on salary
for two years.</i>

<i>Now, do you know how many
units you've sold in that time?</i>

Five.
DONALD: <i>Four.</i>

<i>You sold four units.</i>

What do you want, Donald?

DONALD: <i>If you don't sell 30 air-conditioning
units in the next two weeks,</i>

<i>you're fired.</i>

What?

MARTHA: <i>Mom, I know you
wanted me to have this job,</i>

<i>but I told you, I'm not good
at this kinda stuff.</i>

<i>Crap.</i>

<i>What a tool.</i>

<i>Trying to fire me...</i>

<i>in front of my assistant.</i>

<i>How embarrassing.</i>

<i>Eureka.</i>

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>
Good evening.

My name is Martha Plant.
[CALL DISCONNECTS]

I was calling to see
if you were interested

in staying extra cool
this summer.

WOMAN 1: [CHUCKLES] <i>No.</i>
[CALL DISCONNECTS]

Good evening.

My name is Martha Plant.

WOMAN 2: <i>Wait, who is this?</i>

Martha Plant.

I'm calling to see
if you were interested

in staying extra cool
this summer.

WOMAN 2: <i>Oh,
is this a sales call?</i>

Yes.

My mother's father's sister,

Thelma, died of heat exhaustion.

The heat is real.

WOMAN 2: [SIGHS]
<i>I'm so sorry to hear that.</i>

Thank you. That means so much.

So...

I make these calls because

I want to make my imprint,
you know,

however small,

if I could prevent
a single premature death,

I'll die happier knowing I did.

You know,
I didn't catch your name.

What can I call you?

<i>I'm Judy.</i>

<i>Judy Fine.</i>

Hi, Judy.
JUDY: <i>Hi.</i>

Why, I'm so happy
to meet you.

Do you know anyone
who's dies from the heat?

JUDY: <i>My neighbor died
of heat stroke.</i>

Like I said,

the heat is real.

You'd think our bodies could
withhold a lot more but...

We're so fragile and sacred.

JUDY: <i>Ain't that the truth.</i>

Judy, do you have
an air-conditioner?

Your parents
were really, really old

when they adopted you.

Yeah.

They're dead now.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Everybody's dead.

My grandfather was shot

in the head before I was born.

Oh.

That's so horrible.

Who killed him?

I don't want to talk about it.

Okay.

JESUS CHRIST: You can't really
get to know a girl, speed dating.

MAN 1: Oh.
You need at least an hour,

face to face, to find out who she really is.
MAN 1: Whoa.

You see?
MAN 1: I see.

And today, you and her...
Jesus...

[SADIE GASPS]

[LOCK CLICKS]
[CHAIN RATTLES]

Why do you keep
locking this to your head?

[IN CHILD-LIKE VOICE]
Ask Angie.

Who's Angie?
My friend.

Is everything all right, Sadie?

Who's Sadie?

What?
Who's Sadie?

You're Sadie.

I'm Emma.

Who's Emma?
I'm Emma.

Where's Sadie?
Who's Sadie?

You're Sadie.
I'm Emma.

Who are you?

[THUMPING]
[PHONE RINGING]

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>

Good morning,
my name is Martha Plant.

How...
Oh, what kind of plant are you?

MAN: <i>Excuse me?</i>
I apologize.

What?

You have to stop talking.

Why?

Because I'm working.

But you're on the phone.

Exactly.

MAN: <i>Uh, ma'am?</i>

I'm selling
air-conditioning units

for a company
called Clear Breeze.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[DRUM ROLL]

MARTHA: <i>Hospital and Mental
Health Center, my ass.</i>

<i>Discharging a nut like her.</i>

<i>If I had friends,</i>

<i>I don't even know how I
would describe her to them.</i>

<i>And they wouldn't understand.</i>

<i>Five, ten, 11, 12, 13...</i>

<i>Good thing she's with me.</i>

<i>I've always wanted a little sister.</i>
[WHOOPING AS EMMA]

[TYPEWRITER KEYS CLANKING]


[TOY WHEELS RATTLING]


Emma, is there something
you wanna tell me?

No.

Emma?

Did you go to the bathroom
in your dress?

No.

Yes. Yes, you did.

You pooped your pants.

Well, mommy says I'm not
allowed to eat peanut butter.

Then why did you eat
the sandwich?


[WATER SPLASHING]

SADIE: [AS EMMA]
Who's your best friend?

I don't have a best friend.

Why?

I don't really relate.

Why?

I don't know.

Mm. My best friend
is really old.

Who's your best friend?
You.

I'm not that old.

How old are you? Like, two?

Four.

Are you a boy? Or a girl?

I'm a girl.

Oh.


Is something wrong
with the soup?

It's green.

Were you trying
to kill yourself today?

No.

Do you want to die?
No.

Well, you almost did.

You have to look both ways.

I'm not going to do that
again, Martha.

Good.

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I have to tell you something

about what happened yesterday.

I'd appreciate that.

I looked in one of your tins.

Okay?

I saw Jesus in your tin.

What do you remember
about yesterday?

You boss told you you're pretty
much gonna lose your job.

Something wrong?

[PHONE RINGING]

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>

Good morning, my name is Martha...
[CALL DISCONNECTS]

I'm calling to see if you're interested in...
[CALL DISCONNECTS]

Good morning,
my name is Martha Plant

and I'm calling to see
if you're interested

in staying extra cool
this summer.

WOMAN: <i>Wait, what is this?</i>

I'm selling
air-conditioning units.

WOMAN: <i>Yeah. Don't call here again!</i>
[CALL DISCONNECTS]

[DIAL TONE]

Elephants are apparently
the most amazing mothers.

Carrying their babies for 20
months inside their bellies.

And they stay together
for 16 years.

Just like humans.

I can't wait to have children.

WOMAN: <i>Well, sweetheart,
it's exhausting</i>

<i>but it's worth it.</i>

Oh, I bet.

WOMAN: <i>My eldest...
Been a challenge, all right.</i>

<i>The only thing
he wants to date,</i>

<i>is an accident.</i>


[PHONE RINGING]

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>

Hi.

I'm Martha Plant.


How are you?

MAN: <i>I'm okay.</i>

<i>How are you?</i>

I'm fine.

I'm calling to see
if you're interested

in staying extra cool
this summer.

MAN: <i>What does that mean?</i>

We have a once in a lifetime
special going on here

at Clear Breeze
air-conditioning.

One unit now, for $199.
[MOUTHING ALONG]

MAN: <i>What does it usually cost?</i>

About the same.

MAN: <i>Ah, okay.
Okay, tell me about it.</i>

Its...

It will cool the air.

MAN: <i>Well, what else?</i>

It's just
an air-conditioning unit.

MAN: <i>I don't... I don't know.</i>

<i>I mean, do you have,
like a catalogue,</i>

<i>you could send me or something?</i>

I like Pina coladas.

MAN: <i>Okay.</i>

I do.

Do you?

MAN: <i>I mean,
it's been a while.</i>

Yeah.

MAN: <i>Oh, okay.</i>

Okay, what?

MAN: <i>I'll take it.</i>

You'll take what?

MAN: <i>The air-conditioner.</i>

Really?

[TENSE MUSIC SOARS]

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

<i>â™ª Why won't you have fun â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª When it's easy</i>

<i>â™ª To give up on my love</i>

<i>â™ª When you tease me</i>

<i>â™ª Can you run
Little wave â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Would you need me</i>

<i>â™ª I can't help but fall</i>

<i>â™ª Destiny is calling â™ª</i>


Martha?

Yeah?

I saw something.

Um, in a tin.

It wasn't Jesus.

That's good.

It was Moses.

He parted the sea
and I was running through it.

I was running
as fast as I could.

But I couldn't keep up
with the Israelites...

Sadie?
Yeah?

Did you talk to doctors
at Bridges about this?

I wasn't seeing anything then.

I think you need to see someone.

I think
I'm receiving information.

I think you're hallucinating.

Something in your head
is making this stuff up.

I want to go
see someone about this.

Who?
Jesus.

Jesus is not a doctor.

He's not a good person
to talk to.

Well then,
I'll just go talk to God.

[PHONE RINGING]

RICHARD: <i>Hello?</i>

Hello, Mr. Cox, this is Martha...
RICHARD: <i>Martha.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>

I was calling to thank you

for your purchase of our

Clear Breeze
air-conditioning system.

It is shipped
and should be arriving.

RICHARD: <i>Does it get old?</i>

What?
RICHARD: <i>You know, your spew.</i>

I don't say that line that much.

RICHARD: <i>Why not?</i>

I haven't sold a unit in months.

[RICHARD CHUCKLES]

<i>You... you're funny.</i>

Thanks.

JESUS: When you say
you saw Jesus,

in the tin,

you mean
you just felt him, right?

No.

I could've touched him.

And at first,
I was so scared but...

Now I feel like I'm supposed
to be watching.

Like, he's showing
himself to me,

the way he shows himself to you.

It's not so visible, Sadie.

I don't actually see Jesus

or any of his word.

I just feel him.

RICHARD: <i>I don't know
what kind of person you are</i>

<i>but I was walking
down the aisle today.</i>

<i>I was in this supermarket
and I stopped</i>

<i>and I... I didn't know</i>

<i>what the heck
I was doing there.</i>

<i>Not in the crazy sense, but...</i>

<i>Sometimes I wonder,</i>

<i>what I'm doing.</i>

<i>Like, really doing.</i>

MARTHA: <i>Are you kidding me?</i>

<i>What an insult.</i>

<i>Like I'm gonna
use a dirty toothpick.</i>

[SOFT INSTRUMENTAL
MUSIC PLAYING]


What are you doing?

This is my favorite room.

What are you doing here?

What?

In this house?

I grew up here.

Oh.

So this was...

I get it.

It's cute.

I didn't know you drink.

Did you want some?

So are we gonna
get in the wagon?

Not today.

You should speak louder.

What?

How dare you.

I don't know what you're...
I can't hear you.

I'm talking...
Speak louder.

I don't want to.
Do it.


Who are you?

I'm Angie.

Where's Sadie?

Sadie leaves
when she's feeling bad.

MARTHA: <i>I'm Martha Plant.</i>

And I'm gonna admit it.

The heat is real.

Is it hot where you are?
The weather?

MAN: <i>Yeah,
it's pretty horrible.</i>

MARTHA: <i>You're in
the desert, too.</i>

MAN: <i>I am.</i>

MARTHA: <i>It's so hard
talking to strangers, man.</i>

I sell these
air-conditioning units

so just thanks for listening.

How about you?
What's your name?

<i>Ma'am, for the third time,
my name is Eric.</i>

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

What happened to you guys?

We're from
the rainbowfish family.

Rainbowfish.

It's a sex cult.

We escaped.

You're tough.

Yeah. A lot tougher than Sadie.

Too bad she gets
all the screen time.

Aren't I more equipped
for the real world?

The real world sucks.

Yeah. She gets better,
what happens to me?

So when people
ask what you do...

Do you say you're a telemarketer or
do you tell them you're like a...

I'm a planter.

Right.
Yeah.

Yeah. It's, like, totally odd.

I mean, people actually
pick your stuff up.

It's insane.

I mean, you should be proud.

You're doing something
really asinine and it's working.

I think I wanna throw up.



[PHONE RINGING]

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>
Good morning.

My name is Martha Plant.
MAN: <i>Yes.</i>

"Yes" what?

MAN: <i>I will take it.
Whatever you're selling.</i>

It's an air-conditioning unit.

MAN: <i>Yes.</i>

For $199.

MAN: <i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

Why?
MAN: <i>I'm working on saying "yes" more in my life.</i>

<i>This guy on the radio said
the most successful people...</i>

You have different people

living inside of you?

I know.

Really?

Yeah.

People at Bridges
told me about them.

Oh.

Is there a way
to get rid of them?

They were trying
to get us all to meet.

If Jesus wants us to, we will.

I had a pet possum, too.

WOMAN 1: <i>Really?</i>

He died at four.


You know you're choosing cool
when you choose Clear Breeze.

WOMAN 2: <i>Can't wait.</i>

Waffles during the summer can only
be enjoyed during the cool weather.

MAN: <i>You make a good point.</i>


[LINE RINGING]

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>

Hi.
MAN: <i>Hi, Martha.</i>

Uh, how are you?

MAN: <i>Apparently, you know?</i>

<i>Here and there. How about you?</i>

It's been weird.

Martha Poop.

That's what they
called me in school.

MAN: <i>Stinky cocks in your socks.
That was mine. But pardon me.</i>

It's okay.

MAN: <i>Well...</i>

<i>probably made
you stronger, huh?</i>

Probably.

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

<i>â™ª I can see straight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I wanted to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's a sad day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When I'm without you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My... â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Nothing I can do â™ª</i>

It's like, I'm seeing
God's word.

Where I am with God.

God sent that rainbow
as a promise, but...

my presence broke it.

I think
it's interesting, Sadie.

What are these
tins for?

Home, where there's a planter.

A what?

I can't, I'm...

I'm not sure...
I just...

I want to help you.

I just need
to understand more.

<i>What's the purpose
of it?</i>

I mean, she makes
a little money.

I see.

But, but it's more
than that, it's...

it's a really beautiful
process and...

It comforts her.

Right.

What?

I believe...

I believe you're
seeing something.

Oh.

Good.

But it's not him.

What do you mean?

Works of darkness,
Sadie.

I don't understand.

I wouldn't open
those tins no more.

I don't think Martha has
a good spirit around her.


That's not gonna
work for me.

I'm broke down.

I'm hungry, I...

I'm in the middle
of nowhere, man.

Well, what am I going to do
for four days?

Suck my thumb?

Richard?

Martha?

<i>â™ª When it's you and me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Together â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's fine â™ª</i>

It just looked like
a brown paper bag

just laying
in the road and, uh,

I look in rearview
and I realize

the brown paper bag
is this big,

fat squirrel.

And I got so lost

looking at this
poor guy,

I just drove right off
the road and smack,

right into
a street light.

I didn't get
your name.

Uh, this is Sadie.

Hi.
Hi.

Are you friends?

We're best friends.

Are you together?

We've been together
for about a week or so.

I didn't know you
were in a relationship.

We're not.

Oh.

But you know
this primordial

towing company can't get a truck
out here for a couple of days.

If it's okay,

I'll just need a ride
to the closest motel.

Okay.

What about you?

What do you do?

Now, I have
something new going.

But it's just the
beginning, you know.

We make acupuncture
needles for animals.

I love needles.

Yeah.

It makes me happy.


My mother...

She died
three days ago.

[CONTINUES CRYING]

necrotizing fasciitis.

A flesh eating bacteria.

I didn't know
you were so...

I didn't know you
were so young, Martha.

Well, you should
stay here, you know.

Until that truck can get
your car back to San Diego.

We'd love
your company.

Mm.

Martha, what gave
you the idea

to put peanut butter
on both sides of bread

with a layer of jelly
in between?

It was an accident.

Moment of spontaneity
are so magical.


Oh, I'm really glad
we're all here.

He put us together
for a reason.

Who?

Jesus.

Thanks for letting
me crash, Martha.

Yeah.

I don't know when this towing
company is going to get it together.

But I can leave
at any time.

It's fine.

I mean... no one else
is using the couch.

Right.

Well...

Thank you.

I'm sorry, Richard.

Goodnight.

Goodnight, Martha.

MARTHA: <i>I gave them a
perfectly good screwdriver</i>

<i>and all they gave
me back was nothing.</i>

<i>Great.</i>

<i>Unfortunately, Richard won't be
able to fully grasp my process.</i>


I hear electric wheelchairs
are all the rave right now.

WOMAN: <i>Really?</i>

The water pressure's
very powerful,

don't you think?

You know, you get
cleaner that way.

Well, I used to like
being naked...

[GULPS]
...when I was sad.

I dig when I'm sad.

I... I've never stolen
anything in my life.

[MELANCHOLY
MUSIC PLAYING]

<i>â™ª If you are â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Shining like a star â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Dancing your way

Hey.

Emma.

Come here.

The homeless man
won't wake up.

Come here.

I think he's dead.

Come here. Now.

No!

[BOTH SCREAMING]

What are you doing,
Sadie?

Who are you?

Who am I?

Is your butt
dirty too?

No.

Is the homeless man's
butt dirty?

No.

Did you clean it?

He cleaned
his own butt.

Oh.

You like his butt?

Yeah.

He has a nice butt.

Martha.

Martha?

MARTHA: <i>What?</i>

<i>It's just bad luck.</i>

<i>It won't happen again.</i>

<i>Put my flier up,
he'll take it.</i>

<i>He'll read it clearly.</i>

<i>He'll dig it up.</i>

<i>Be happy
with the product.</i>

<i>And give me cash.</i>

<i>Cash.</i>

<i>Everything
will be fine.</i>

Does she know she becomes
someone else?

Yeah.

But it's not
in her control.

My Ma crapped
in her pants, too.

I mean, at the end.

Uh, just...

Just... punch me
in the face.

I should have spent
more time with her.

What would that do?

What?

If I punched you
in the face.

My parents were decapitated
in a car accident a year ago.

I thought they were
going to die in their sleep

like normal people.

I'm... I'm sorry, Martha.

I knew they'd
be dead soon,

but I still locked
myself in my room

when they asked me
to go to bingo.

I kind of
hate myself now.

I hate myself, too.

[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]

Hey.

Morning.

I'm sorry.

It's fine.

I had a dream I was
on a ferry selling lemonade.

And it was going well.

I was selling a lot.

Then I saw Carl.

What did you like about him?

I liked his hair.

What do you
like about him?

Who?

Richard.

He' weird.

MAN 1: <i>I'll take it.</i>

WOMAN: <i>Oh, I can't wait to wear
my birthday suit all day.</i>

MAN 2: <i>Pay me the...</i>

[DRAMATIC
MUSIC PLAYING]

MARTHA: <i>Who the hell
is doing this to me?</i>

<i>This is sabotage.</i>

<i>This guy is sick!</i>

<i>What kind of fre steals
from a business like mine?</i>

<i>I bet he's ugly</i>

<i>and eats cheesy puffs
for breakfast.</i>

Or maybe, they don't
have much to give.

Or maybe, they're new
to the process.

I doubt it.

Maybe they're confused.
I know I am.

Confused about what?

It's just a couple
of dollars.

It's not about the money.
[GASPS]

Maybe they're from
out of town.

Who cares.

Maybe it's a joke.

It's not funny.

Well, maybe they're...

Fucked up!

Richard, this is Angie.

Hi.


How many are there?

Three.

Enjoying your vacation?

Uh-huh, yeah.
Yeah.

You really like Martha,
don't you?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Feels good, huh?

Yeah.

What are you
like, 70, 75?

What?

I mean, can you
still get it up?


My mother's dead.

We know.

I mean...

We're sorry.

I'm just waiting
for the tow truck company.

I think you're here
for other reasons.

Where you the one

locking the helmet
on Emma's head?

What helmet?

Why did you
do that?

Oh, it's like...

It's like...

Protection.

If you had to be stuck
in the closet with someone

for the rest
of your life,

who would it be?

Does it have
to be a person?

No.

Then, my dead dog,
Taco.

Of all things
you planted,

what was
your favorite?

A taxidermy raccoon.


Have you ever been
in love, Martha?

No.

Why are you
still alone?

I don't know.

I'm just...

I'm never real
comfortable, you know.

And, uh...

You kinda
have to be.

To be with someone.

I got to tell you
something, Martha.

I like being on this side of
things, I do.

But it is a little tough
listening to you,

rather air
conditioning calls.

I mean...

I get heavy
in my heart.

I can't get it out
of my head,

that maybe,

maybe you talk
to other people

the way you
talk to me.

That I'm not
that special.

Can I confirm the spelling
of your last name?

WOMAN: <i>Oh, sure.</i>

You look splendid, Richard.

Thank you, Sadie.
Your eyes are shining.

You must be feeling better.

I am.

[INDISTINCT]
WOMAN: <i>That's correct.</i>

Thank you.

And you know
you're choosing cool

and you choose Clear Breeze

Can you please pass the chalk?

BOTH: Sorry.

[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING]


[SCREAMING CONTINUES]

Hm. This should pass.

Where were you before Martha?

I was in love.

That's nice.

Yeah. I think
you would've liked Carl.

[MARTHA SCREAMING]

You think she'll ever
get over it?

What?

The tin stuff.

I hope not.
Why?

Because if she
never sees anything,

then I really am crazy.

"At the last trumpet,

"and the dead

"and we shall be changed."

What did you see?

I saw the Rapture.

I was left behind...

and so were you.

Sadie...

I... I have to go.

WOMAN: <i>It's been
one of those days.</i>

<i>Everything that could go wrong
has gone wrong.</i>

<i>Do you think...</i>

MARTHA: Uh,
It very well could be.

WOMAN: That's great. You call my husband that
name and I'm gonna have you a boyfriend tonight.

MARTHA: <i>I swear.</i>

<i>This guy is dead!</i>

<i>He's dead to me!
Watch me find him!</i>

<i>Dead. Dead.</i>

<i>Dead! Dead!</i>


Why would someone
want to sabotage my business?

I have no idea.

I mean, it's one of the most
successful enterprises in the area.

Oh, I know.
What?

Someone would really do this
out of jealousy?

This is a real sicko!

Martha.
This is why I can't do people.

Martha.
What?

It just slipped.
What?

But today, I saw him
with a yellow screwdriver.

What?
I'm so sorry, Martha.

Please forgive me.
What are you talking about?

I told Jesus
about your planting!

What?

I told Jesus
that you're the planter.

Who's Jesus?

Jesus!

Martha!

"Beware of false prophets

"which come to you
in sheep's clothing."

Why're you stealing
my plants, Jesus?

Stay back, Sadie.

The wolf plays ignorance.

Hey. Put the bottle down, man.

Stay away from my tins, Jesus.

Everything in those tins
is the work of the devil.

Work of the devil?

I knew you were a murderer.

I didn't know you were a liar!

Murderer?
He robbed an old man

of his life, when all he wanted
was a strawberry milkshake.

But he never got that milkshake

and I never
got my grandfather.

Because you killed him!

You killed her grandfather?

I just shot the gun
and it hit him.

Why?

No one was supposed to get hurt.

I'd never held a gun before.

I've thought about that moment

every day since I was 19.

I don't know
where you come from,

but I came from a trashcan.

And I've made something
of myself.

I'm the planter and you're not
gonna take that away from me.

Now I know why you're doing
what you're doing.

You're making Sadie think
I was talking to her.

But don't make her
pay for my sins.

That's why you've been stealing
my plants?

You think
I'm putting Jesus in my tins?

Well Jesus hasn't actually been
in all the tins.

I have no idea what's going on.

I haven't stolen
anything, Martha.

I've done enough sin
in this life.

[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING]

RICHARD: Martha?

Everything okay?

We'll find out
who it is, Martha!

[MUSIC STOPS]

7:30 a.m. breakfast.
8:00 a.m. departure.

We're gonna get this guy.

SADIE: Richard.

Your lip is twitching.
Really?

Yeah.
Oh.

I'm nervous too.

I'm not nervous.

We need to be prepared
for anything.

There are real freaks out there.

Yeah.

It's a good thing you have me.

Yeah.

I mean, have you ever thought
of what could happen out there?

A little.

We need weapons.

Okay.

Well, we have a shovel.

RICHARD: A shovel won't stop
someone with a gun.

Oh, you're right.

What should we do?
We'll bring these.

Now, a knife...

For obvious reasons.

Put a fork in the eye.
That'll blind them.

Now I don't like blood either,

especially if it's coming
from the face.

[AS EMMA]
Well I don't wanna use a fork.

Mommy always taught me
to use my hands.

Okay.

Use your hands.

[SNARE DRUM MARCH PLAYING]

You look good.

What if we miss them?

What do you mean?

What if they come at night?

They gotta do it at night.

I mean, it would be too easy
during the day.

Too... too easy to get caught.

It'd be hard to find
the coordinates at night.

Not if they had a flashlight.

Oh. Mommy says
I'm not supposed to put

things in my mouth, Richard.

You're right, sweetie.
It's a bad habit.

What?

What?

You put the toothpick in my tin.

What toothpick?

You've been taking my plants.

Oh.

Martha.

It was you.

You've got it all wrong.

You're way off track here.

I'm off track?

Yeah, yeah, you are.

Oh my God.
Martha!

A couple of days
after I started talking to you,

I got my first empty tin.
What're you talking about?

How would I even know
about your planting business?

Everybody knows.

My flyers have been coveted
for years.

You're not making any sense.

So you hit a squirrel
and ran into a lamp post.

Come on!

That fat rodent
destroyed my car!

I can't believe I let you
stay with us!

Is your mother even dead?

I have to tell you
something, Martha Plant!

Oh, it's this day
you're gonna tell me the truth?

Yeah. Yeah, I am.

Then say it!
Here I go!

Go for it!
I love you, Martha Plant!

MARTHA: What is she doing?

What're you doing?

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
How does it feel, Martha?

Hm?

How does it feel to know
that the thief

has been shitting in your toilet
all along?

I mean, you picked
some pretty weird places

to plant shit and it's not easy

getting there
in the middle of the night...

when you're drunk.

But I did it.

And I thought you should know.

[SCREAMS]
[GRUNTS]

I took care of you.

Martha, it's just
not working out.

Look at you. You're choking me.

Why? Why did you do it?

I like
to keep things interesting.

No! Tell my why!

Self-preservation!

You're sick.
You're sick.

It's just a tin with junk in it.


If you kill me,
you kill Sadie too.


If you care at all about Sadie,

you'll tell her to forever stay
the hell away from me.

[INHALES SHARPLY]

[BREATHING HEAVILY]


[PHONE RINGING]

MAN: <i>Hello?</i>
I'm Martha Plant

and I'm calling
because the heat is real.

<i>When it gets too hot outside,</i>

<i>those beautiful flowers,
they die.</i>

That's kind of what happens to
your insides when you overheat.

Do you know the one thing...

The one thing in this Earth
that won't let you down?

Our Clear Breeze
air conditioning system.

<i>Because if you let yourself be
susceptible to all the freaks out there,</i>

<i>you don't know where you'll be.</i>

Alone? Maybe. Is it
that bad though? Being alone?

You hear that?
That's a drumroll.

That's giving you ten seconds
to make your decision

on whether you're gonna buy

a Clear Breeze
air conditioning system.

I'm waiting. The drums
are playing for you.

This is the time to be cool.

Because Clear Breeze is offering
you a once in a lifetime special...

I'm here to help you.

It's up to you.

Help you, help me help you.

Melt in the heat if you'd like.
Become a puddle of sweaty...

<i>I'm gonna be honest here.</i>

More honest than I've ever been
with anyone before.

I'm about to lose my job.

Don't hang up that phone.
Do not hang up that phone.

We only have a limited time
on this planet.

Why waste it in pain and misery?

Are you sitting by
your purse right now?

How hot is your hand?

Sweaty? Disgusting?

'Cause all you
have to do is... Zip!

...open up your purse
and tell me, "Martha,

"I want to buy
an air conditioning unit!"

[PHONE RINGING]

Hello?

<i>Martha. Donald.</i>

Hi.
<i>I don't know</i>

<i>exactly what you did,
but it worked!</i>

<i>You've sold
all 30 air conditioners.</i>

Yup.
<i>It was a shock to me</i>

<i>and I am sure it was
a shock to Enoch...</i>

<i>So it looks like we'll be
flying you down to headquarters</i>

<i>first class, Martha!</i>

<i>You can teach everyone here
the mysterious ways</i>

<i>of Ms. Martha Plant!</i>

<i>Pack your bags. It's showtime!</i>

<i>West Texas
is a really lovely place</i>

<i>and I'm sure people
will love to meet</i>

<i>the notorious and famous,
most excellent Martha Plant!</i>

Thank you

for your help.

I sold
all the air conditioning units.

Oh! That's great.

They wanna fly me down
to headquarters.

Wow. That's a real big deal.

I've never been
on an airplane before.

Me either.

I hear they give free snacks.

I thought you never wanted
to see me again.

How did you know that?

Angie.

We made a deal.

I told her she could stay as long
as she stops stealing your plants.

I guess she was donating
them all to the church.


I'm glad you met.

Yeah.

She's not a very nice person.

MARTHA: <i>If it were
the apocalypse,</i>

<i>and I could only
save one thing,</i>

<i>I'd save my assistant.</i>

DISCIPLE 1: Man, are you scared?

JESUS CHRIST: Yeah.
It's not easy being a savior.

DISCIPLE 2: I'm scared for you.

JESUS CHRIST:
It's gonna be fine.

I'll finally be
completely off the grid.

Off the grid? Radical, man.

I'm gonna let the fuzz
take me in.

Beat me up and nail me
to the tree.

What about the Roman guards?

The Roman guards
are gonna hide me in a tomb.

[ALL LAUGH]
And then,

I'm gonna come back
from the dead.
