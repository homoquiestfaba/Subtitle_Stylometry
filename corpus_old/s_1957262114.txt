<i>Nor for the pestilence

<i>Nor for the destruction
that wasteth at noonday.</i>

<i>Be with me Lord,
in my hour of need.</i>

<i>Because thou hast made the
Lord, which is my refuge,</i>

in my hour of need.

no evil befall thee,

neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.

in my hour of need.

his angels charge over thee,

to keep thee in all thy ways.

in my hour of need.

Let's take a little break,
shall we?

Hon, are you feeling
all right?

Yeah, I'm fine.


I just can't remember
one quite like this.

He should try and get
some sleep.

Yeah. Here you go.

Oh, I'll take him, Mr. Glatzel.
Huh?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Thank you, Arne.
No problem. Come on, buddy.

He can't take much more
of this.

He won't have to.

Things will move quickly now that
the exorcism's been approved.

Father Gordon's already
on his way.

You're one brave kid,
you know?

I was a little runt growing up,

so I know what it's like
to be picked on.

But...

But that was nothing compared
to what you're going through.

I don't feel very brave.

Being brave doesn't mean
you're not scared.

It means you are scared
but you hang in there.

It's gonna be all right.

I won't let anything
happen to you.

I promise.

Arne. When are you gonna
ask my sister to marry you?


I don't know what
you're talking about.

Come on.
No, I don't, I...

[knock on door]
[gasps]

[loud banging on door]

[loud bang]
[door knob rattling]

[rattling stops]

[rustling softly]

[knife unsheathes]

[breath trembling]

[tap knobs squeaking]

No! Help me!

No, no, no! No, no, no!


David!
[Judy] David! Where is he?

[glass breaking]

David!

[David screaming]

[breathing heavily]

Are you okay?

David, what's going on?

David?




Father, we need to do this,
right now!

Okay, let's get him down to the car
and we'll drive him to the church.

No, Father. Right now.

[David screaming]



Grab his arms, don't let go.


Save your servant
who trusts in you, my God.

Let him find in you, Lord,

a fortified tower in the face
of the enemy.

Put on the full armor of God,

that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.

Against the powers
of the darkness of this world.

Against wickedness.

[groans]
Lorraine, what's wrong?

I'm fine.

Lorraine.

Lord! Send him aid
from your Holy place

and watch over him from Sion.

[sizzling]
[screaming]

Lord, heed my prayer.

Lord!

[distorted scream]

[screaming stops]


[distorted laughter]

No. Father!

[Debbie shrieks]


Where's your first aid kit?
It's in the kitchen!

I'm on it!

Ed, hurry up!

Hurry, Ed!

Ed. Ed, Hurry!

[reciting in Latin]

[distorted laughter]

It's not working!

[continues reciting in Latin]

[bones cracking]

What? David, wait!

Stop it! What? What?

[yells]
[screaming]

David! David! Help me, please!

What are you doing? David!

Help him, please!

David, stop it! David! David!


Leave him alone!
Arne, don't talk to it.

I said, leave him alone.
He's just a little boy, you coward!

No, Arne, don't talk to it!

[Debbie screams]

your heart, old man.


Ed!


Hey!

Listen to me. Look at me.


Look at me. I know
you're still in there, David.

Just leave him alone, okay?

Leave him alone and take me.

Take me.

[gasping]
Hey, take me. Take me!

David!

Leave him alone and take me!

[breathing heavily]


No.

No, no.

David. David, David!

David, are you okay? Hey, hey.

David, go with Mom.

Oh, oh!

Yes, David.


Ed? Ed! Hon!

What?


Somebody call 911!
Okay.

Mrs. Warren.

He's stabilized.

We're gonna transfer him
to the coronary unit.

So, it was a heart attack?
Yes.

And not a minor one,
I'm afraid.

Can we see him now?
Not yet.

We're gonna to put a stent
into his artery,

try to get blood flowing
back to his heart.


So, is he gonna be all right?

We're gonna need to run a few more tests
before I'm comfortable answering that.

I'm sorry.

[Arne] <i>Leave him alone!</i>
[Ed] <i>Arne, don't talk to it.</i>

<i>Leave him alone and take me.</i>

<i>Leave him alone!</i>

[David screaming]

[machine whirring]

[whirring stops]

Hey, the mummy lives.

Hey, why did you let me
sleep so late?

I didn't let you,
I couldn't wake you.

You couldn't wake me?
No, I couldn't.

Oh, that's strange.

You mustn't have been
trying very hard.


[dogs barking]

[man] Buddy! Easy, easy, easy!
Okay, Bruno is right outside.

Oh, come on. Bruno's a worldly
man, he doesn't care.


No, no, wait. Actually,
I do want to ask you something.

Okay. What do you want
to ask me?

Um...

It's no big deal.
Mmm-hmm.

I've... I've been thinking...
Mmm-hmm.

And now David's
out of the woods,

maybe we should
put all this behind us

and get out of this place.

You know?
You mean, leave Brookfield?

Sure, why not? We've got nothing
keeping us here now. Do we?

Oh, yeah.
Nothing but my family

and all the money
we don't have. Arne...

Okay, well,
money's no big deal, right?

We're both working,

and this place doesn't
cost us anything.

Arne, I just started this job.
I can't just up and walk out now.

[Bruno] Jesus Christ!
And besides,

Bruno doesn't know the first thing
about taking care of these dogs.

Hey...

Let me think about it. Okay?

You'll think about it?
Yeah, I'll think about it.

Okay. There we go.

Okay, get dressed.

I love you.

[rock music playing]
I think David will love that.

Did you call my mom?
[Arne] Yeah, I did.

I told her we were going to be very late.
Okay, thank you.

No, Arne. Please stop eating,
please stop.

Mrs. Haskett, so good to see
you, thanks for coming by.

Hey, we're headed out now.
Bye, Pookie.

I wrote down a list of stuff
for you to do while we're gone.

Oh, keeping track of this stuff is
what I'm supposed to be paying you for.

Not on weekends, you're not.

I'm letting you live here
rent free.

That should buy me the weekends
maybe the holidays, too.

Okay, Andy gets one cup,
everyone else gets two.

Magic and Sparky are getting picked up,
so you don't need to worry about them.

But, you'll have to take everyone else
outside at some point this afternoon.

Oh, Ruby's allergic to bees, if she gets
stung you've got to call the emergency vet.

I wrote the number down
and stuck it on the fridge.

[song faltering]

Yo, Arne, you wanna make
a quick five bucks, man?

My stereo's busted.

Yeah, sure. I'll take a look at it later.
But, make it 15.

Ten.

...what happened this morning.
I know.

Ma, okay.
Please don't say anything.

I won't say anything,
I promise.

Okay, just...

He asked if we could
leave Brookfield.

[gasps] You know what that means, don't you?
No.

Actually, you mean he proposed?
Not exactly.

Did you say, yes?
Not exactly.

Arne! Can you bring out
the tray with the meat on it?

Oh, yes. I'm starving!
Are you starving, bud?

Yeah.

Okay, I'll go get the meat.

Ow!
[chuckles]







[woman on PA]
<i>Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.</i>

<i>Doctor Merrick, to OR-6.</i>

[knocks on wood]

It was nice seeing Judy again.

Will she be staying long?

I don't know, um,
it depends if...

The nurse says that you have
been sleeping in that chair.

Ed would understand if you went
home for a little while.

Did I ever tell you the story
of how we met?

No, I don't think so.

Just that you were young.
In high school, wasn't it?

Yeah. We were 17.

<i>I went out with
my girlfriends and...</i>

<i>And he was an usher at the
movie theater that we went to.</i>

Afterwards...

<i>we went out for ice cream.</i>

<i>He took me out to the park,
but then it started to rain.</i>

<i>And we stood under the gazebo
until it stopped.</i>

That was 30 years ago.

I could go back
to the house, Father,

but my home is here
with him.

[indistinct chatter]



Jesus Christ, Arne!
What the hell?

[breathing heavily]

Can we please do something
about this racket?

These dogs are driving
me crazy!

smell a rabbit or something.

How come you're not at work?
I wasn't feeling so hot.

Perfect timing, man.

[dogs barking]

Hey, why don't you come inside
with me, have a beer.

If we get that stereo fixed we
can put up a sign, close up shop.

You know what, I don't think so, Bruno.
Come on.

Why, you quit drinking?
No, I just don't...

Tell you what, we can
both quit next Saturday.

How about that? [laughs]


Lorraine.
Daddy!

Oh, Ed, thank God.

Lorraine.

You have to call the Glatzels.
She just called, you're fine...

We have to warn them,
it's got the kid.

No, it's fine, it's over.

David is safe,
the demon is gone.

Arne. It's got Arne!

[rock music playing]

It's beautiful, man.
Nicely done!

Come on, man,
don't make me drink alone.

Your girl's gonna think
I'm a drunk.

Do you know...

that I saw these guys
play in Sydney?

They nearly blew the roof off
Her Majesty's Theater!

Bruno! Can you turn that down?

I'm testing out his work!

[volume increases]

[phone ringing]

[muffled music playing]

[breathing unsteadily]

Hey.

What's the matter?
Are you okay? Bruno...

Let's dance, brother!
Bruno! No, stop!

Bruno. Bruno! Oh, my Lord...

Okay. Bruno, go night-night.

No! Not until we dance.
Yes! No, we're not dancing.

One dance! One dance!
I don't want to dance! Bruno!

Okay, one dance.


[phone ringing]

This is Officer Thomas.
<i>My name is Lorraine Warren.</i>

I know how this is
going to sound,

but there's going to be a tragedy
at the Brookfield Boarding Kennels.

[Debbie screaming]

Debbie!


Arne...
Bruno?

No, stop.

Arne!

Bruno, stop!

Arne, help me.

[roars]
[screaming]

Arne, whoa. What is going on?

What are you doing?
[Arne yelling]

Arne, please stop it!

[dogs barking]

Baby?

[music continues playing]
What the hell?

[music stops]



[Arne grunting]


[sirens wails]

[indistinct radio chatter]

Hey.

You okay there?

Hey.

You okay?

Now, you just stay right there, okay?
Don't move.

I think I hurt someone.

<i>This is Sergeant Thomas.</i>

<i>I have one victim down,
multiple stab wounds.</i>

were shocked this afternoon</i>

<i>by the broad daylight murder
of Bruno Sauls.</i>

<i>Sauls, the manager
of a local dog kennel,</i>

<i>was stabbed 22 times.</i>

<i>This is the first murder in
that town's 193-year history.</i>

into the hill of the Lord?</i>

Or who shall stand
in his holy place?

He that hath clean hands,
and a pure heart,

who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity,

nor sworn deceitfully.

He shall receive the blessing
from the Lord,

and righteousness from the God
of his salvation.


Thank you.

Well?

These religious objects
would've been enough

to provoke an inhuman spirit,

if there was one present.

Does that mean
he's not possessed?

The fact that he can read
from the Bible just seals it.

So, what does this mean,
then...

I'm just crazy?

Well... you're not possessed.

But that doesn't mean
that you weren't.

I... invited this
thing into me,

and that's the reason
that he's dead.

So, you know,
whatever happens to me,

I've got it coming.

No, you don't.

Look...

I was there.

Whatever is going on...

whatever happened that day...

that was not Arne.

We're going to help you
in every way that we can.

If the demon's gone,
what can you do now?

Who's your lawyer?

He was found covered
in the victim's blood.

The murder weapon belongs to him and
it's got his fingerprints all over it.

Nobody's disputing any of that.
Arne knows that he's going to prison.

All we're saying is that there
were mitigating circumstances.

Mitigating circumstances?

Look, I don't think he should
get the death sentence, either.

But I am not going
before a grand jury

and saying he was possessed
by demons.

It's never been done.

Yes it has! It's been done
twice in England.

The Michael Taylor case
was just a few years ago.

Let me rephrase that.
It's never been done successfully.

Then let us help you.

Ed and I have proven the existence
of the demonic hundreds of times.

You've proven it to the church.
This is a court of law.

The standards of evidence
are completely different.

The courts accepts
the existence of God

every time a witness swears
to tell the truth.

I think it's about time they
accept the existence of the devil.

How are you going
to convince a jury

if you can't even convince me?

I'll tell you what.
You come over to our house for dinner.

We'll show you the evidence
we've collected over the years.

Introduce you to Annabelle.

If you're not convinced,
we'll butt out.

Deal?

All right.
Show me what you got.

[gavel banging]

Mr. Johnson, to count one of
indictment number S-A-J-1-2-1-6,

which charges you with
first-degree murder,

a class-A felony,

how do you plead?

Your Honor,
my client pleads not guilty

by reason of
demonic possession.

[bell tolling]

This is ridiculous.
I can walk down a flight of stairs.

Oh, hush. You shouldn't
even be out of bed.

Lorraine.

I just talked to a friend of
mine in the prosecutor's office.

He's gonna go for
the death penalty.

I'll build the case,
but that kid is gonna either live or die

depending on what you two find.

Well, we won't let him down.


Keep me posted.

So, what now?

We've never had to prove
a possession after the fact.

Demons don't just
disappear like this.

There's something else
going on here,

something that we missed
the first time.

Where do we start?

At the beginning.

[Ed on tape]
<i>It's July 18th, 1981.</i>

<i>This is Ed Warren,
here with Lorraine...</i>

<i>and Judy Glatzel,
Deborah Glatzel,</i>

<i>David Glatzel
and Arne Johnson.</i>

<i>All right, let's get started.</i>

<i>Who was there when David first
started exhibiting this behavior?</i>

It was the day we moved in.</i>

There you go.
Go have fun with them.

Wanna order some pizza?
[Debbie] Yeah sure, I'll do that right now.

Hey.
[Arne] Put that box down a second.

[Debbie] Why?
I just...

What are you doing?

Have a look...
What is... Arne!

You know you're supposed to
do this when you get married?

Okay, so maybe
we'll do that too.


[Debbie shrieks]

[hinges creaking]


No!

Mom!

[breath trembling]

what happened.</i>

<i>It was like a dream.</i>

<i>And nobody believed me
when I told them.</i>

<i>But that was the first time
I saw it.</i>

I don't get it.

How could he have invited a demon?
He was only in here for a few minutes.

There wasn't even anything
in here.

Where was the water bed?

Where that rug is.

The wood got damaged
when the mattress ruptured.

Mind if I have a look?
Please.

[gasps softly]

That's not water damage.

Hon, will you let me
handle this?

You're going to ruin your dress
if you go in there.

So, um, the guest room's about
15 feet in and to the right.

Okay.

Just be careful.
Just hold my purse.


[rat screeches]
[screams]

Lorraine! Are you all right?

Yeah, I'm fine, Ed.
It's just a rat.


[rats squeaking]

[praying in Latin]

It's a witch's totem,

used by Satanists
in their rituals.

Remember how I told you that an
inhuman spirit needs to be invited?

And you couldn't imagine
how David could do that?

Well, you were right,
he didn't.

We think David was cursed.

And on the night
of the exorcism,

the curse was passed
from David into Arne.

Cursed?

Are you saying someone
did this to us... on purpose?

We've heard of
satanic rituals like this.

The demon is summoned,

the possessed individual takes
a life and the demon departs.

Which is why Arne was able to
read from the Bible afterwards.

Yeah. We think whoever cursed
David, used this to draw the demon.

And we'd like you to start
mailing these out

to every police department
you can find.

Start locally.

And, just find out if they've
ever seen anything like this.

There might be someone else
we can ask about this.

Do you remember the priest

who helped expose the
Disciples of the Ram cult?

It would've been about
10 or 12 years ago...

Father Kastner?
Yeah, you're right.

Only it isn't "Father" anymore,
he's been retired for a while.

He tried to help those people.

He tried to understand
why they did what they did.

If anyone is going to be able to
tell us what this is, it's him.


I didn't hear the car drive in.

Would either of you care
for an omelet?

We had breakfast before
we left home.

I'm Ed Warren,
this is my wife Lorraine.

I have chicken shit
on my hands.

[both chuckle]


Forget you ever saw this.

You've seen it before?

No. But I've seen ones like it.

This is sophisticated.
It's a very nasty piece of work.

What I don't understand is...
is why?

David, the little boy who was
possessed, he didn't do anything wrong.

Why would someone
target this family?

Why?

The "why" is irrelevant.

The "why" is counter to everything
that the Satanist stands for.

His sole aim is chaos.

His nectar is despair.

But someone had to
put it under their house.

So, what does this tell you
about the person who made it?

Come with me.

[keys jangling]

I don't want to go down there.

[door opens]

What is this?

It's the reason you're here.

[door creaks]

I collected these while I was
studying the Disciples of the Ram.

You should burn all this.
I've thought of it.

But I felt it was safer
to keep them locked.

I like taking guns
off the streets.

I don't suppose you have
all these books organized

using the Dewey Decimal System,
do you?

No. No. No, I do not.

The clues you seek could
be anywhere. Or, they...

Or, they may not be here
at all.

Ed, don't.

these people for nine years.

They worshipped Satan and his
demons with blood sacrifice.

They defiled holy land
with their obscene rituals,

and they committed acts of blasphemy...
which I shall never speak of.

But... these acts gave
them power.

The trial of the Disciples,

the lead prosecutor,
his wife was pregnant.

A few days after the Disciples
were all found guilty,

his baby was born
six weeks early,

with its heart
outside of its body.

Three months later,
his wife committed suicide

by laying her neck
on a railroad track.

A master Satanist is not an
adversary to be taken lightly.

We know the dangers,
better than you might think.

This boy, who's headed
to the death chamber...

is saving him worth
everything you have?

Because that's what it may
very well cost.

[water dripping]


[mic feedback]

So, you gonna clean it up,
or what?

I'm sorry.

[loud thud]


What?

<i>â™ª Color me
your color, darling â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know who you are â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Come up off
your color chart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know where
you're coming from â™ª</i>

[chuckles softly]

<i>â™ª I know who you are â™ª</i>


[indistinct shouting]

It was here!
I swear to God, it was here!

[footsteps approaching]

Look what the Perron family
sent.

Oh, that was sweet of them.

[phone ringing]

I got it.
Ed, let me.

It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

Hello?
[Drew] <i>Ed?</i>

We've got a bite.

I just got off the phone with a
homicide detective in Danvers,

he wants to talk to you guys.
He says he says he's seen it.

[door closes]

Katie Lincoln and Jessica Strong
went missing about four months ago.

They were best friends
in high school.

Katie's body was found
near here, stabbed 22 times.

We still haven't found Jessica.

But when we searched her home
back in May...

we found this.

So, you're the experts.

What can you tell me
about this?

Well, to be honest, not much.

Only that if this totem works the
same way as the one in Brookfield,

it's possible that your
missing girl was possessed.

Look, I've read all about what you
two think happened in Brookfield.

But I'm only interested in leads
that are grounded in reality.

Good. So are we.

We were actually hoping there might
be something in this case file

that might help prove
Arne's story.

No, no, no.
I brought you here to help me,

not the other way around.

Now, we've been looking
for a link to some sort of

satanic cult ever since
we found that thing.

And these devil-worshippers,
they're just people.

Crazy, evil people,
but, people.

Maybe we can help each other.

We need to see your casefile...

and you need to find
the missing girl.

So, give us a chance.

To do what exactly?
To find Jessica.

We've been combing through these forests
for over three months now, Mrs. Warren.

I can see things that
your people can't.


One of these is the knife used
on Katie Lincoln.

The others I just pulled
from the evidence locker.

And what? You want her to pick
out the murder weapon?

Mmm-hmm.

I'll take you out there,
but first I want to see what she can do.

Absolutely not! My wife's gift
is not a sideshow attraction.

If she is what you say she is,
then this shouldn't be a problem,

Mr. Warren. Right?

No way! Forget it. We...
It's this one.

["Suspicious Minds" playing]

<i>â™ª We're caught in a trap â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't walk out... â™ª</i>

It was a one-in-three chance.

[chuckles softly]

This song's appropriate.

<i>â™ª Because I love you
too much, baby â™ª</i>

You know, I actually met
Elvis once.

Oh, yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

Was that before or after he died?
Before...

and after.

<i>â™ª When you don't believe
a word I say? â™ª</i>

You missed a turn.

The spot where you found Katie's
body, it was back that way.

<i>â™ª And we can't build
our dreams â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On suspicious minds â™ª</i>

right now.</i>

<i>If they can find some way to</i>

connect what happened there to
what happened to you, then...

You know, it's...
It's a pattern.

They might even find out
who did this.

Okay. Well, that sounds great,
right?

It's great.
Baby...

What's going on?

Nothing.

I'm fine,
I'm tired, you know...

Come on.

You're keeping something
from me.

Don't you think
I can tell that?

Look, I'm fine. Totally fine.

It's cold in here.

Yeah, right?

It's like, they're trying to freeze us
out, or something.

I remember what it felt like.

You're always cold,
and you're never alone.

David, what are you
talking about?

That's why you can't sleep.
Because it's never quiet in your head.

Sometimes you think something,

then you're not sure
if it was really you.

But now you're seeing it.

It's here with you.
And it's telling you to do things.

Arne, what is it telling
you to do?

You sure you should be tromping
through the woods like this?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Then what are
you worried about?

Afraid she won't be
able to do it?


I'm afraid that she will.

Ed, something terrible
happened here.

[branches creaking]

[rustling]
[gasps]

[wood scraping]

[both laughing]


Hey.

I got you something.

They were selling them
at the May Festival this year.

Your parents still dragging you
up there for that?

Every year, since I was six.

[both chuckle]

It's dumb, but,
I thought this was cool.

It reminded me of the ones
we made in high school.

Will you help me put it on?

Sure.




All right, that's enough.

Hon, that's enough.
That's enough! Come on!

[breathing heavily]

Katie? Katie? Oh, my God.
What did I do?

Hon, no!

Lorraine!




Lorraine.

Ed.


No!


[both sigh]

It's okay. I got you.
I got you.

[Lorraine panting]

She's down there.
Ed, she's down there.

[siren wailing]

a little high.</i>

I'm gonna give you
a vasodilator.

It's a pill, you're gonna
put it under your tongue.

It'll open up
your blood vessels.

Yeah, I have those.

I left them at home.

I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you.

Mind giving us a minute?

Recovery team found a body.

Is it...
We're not sure.

Look, I know what
it looks like.

But, I don't want any of this getting
out until we have a positive ID

from the coroner.

You know, we dragged
this basin. Twice.

Had to pull teeth to get
it done a third time.

We never would've done it
if it weren't for you.

I'm just glad we could help.

Let me know where
you're staying.

And I'll get that casefile
to you in the morning.

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Oh, my God, I've been leaving
messages all day.

What's wrong?
<i>It's Arne. It followed him!</i>

You said this was over,

but now he's trapped in there with
this thing and it's telling him

<i>to kill himself!</i>
Debbie.

Just calm down and listen to me. I need
you to call the prison chaplain, um...

Father Newman.
Father Newman. Tell him that

<i>Arne needs to be put on a 24-hour
suicide watch! He's got...</i>

[static screech]

What? Hello?

What is this thing?


[thunder rumbling]

[keys jangling]

[lock clicking]


God gives everyone the right
to defend themselves.

[lock clicks]


it's not here of its own
free will. It was summoned.

That doesn't make me feel
any better.

That means, we know that this
is a curse,

and curses can be broken.

All right.
Then, how do we do that?

Back at the Glatzel house,

I touched David's hand
and I saw something.

I didn't know what it was then.

But I think that I was connected to
the person who is responsible for this.

Ed, that body they found...

if it's Jessica,
if it's really her,

then that connection
could still be open.

There's gotta be another way.


Okay... okay.

Okay.

<i>The Lord is my shepherd,</i>

there is nothing I shall want.

He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures...

[knock on door]


There's nobody there.

We'll leave a note.

[door creaking]

[door closes]

[switch ticking]

Oh, boy.

Please be careful.



Do you see anything?

No. There's nothing.

There's nothing here.

I'm not sensing it.

Lorraine, what is it?
The connection.

It's here.

[train horn blowing]

[train engine chugging]


Yes.

Yes, there are... some stairs.

I heard a train.

<i>But now...</i>

there's an altar.

All those black candles.

<i>There's 12 of them.
In a circle.</i>

Oh, Ed.

Okay, that's enough,
come back.

I can't.

Lorraine.

[switch ticking]

It's a woman.



Can you tell where she is?

I don't know. I...


<i>She's doing it again.</i>

<i>She's reaching out to Arne.</i>

<i>She's trying to complete
the curse.</i>


<i>Oh, she has him.
She has Arne.</i>

<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

No, no. Oh, God.

End this black sabbath.

By the blood of Calvary
I command it!

I got a cutter! C-19!

Come on, kid.

[wind blowing]

How are you doing this?

God has shown you to me.

Then your God has damned you.

Ed. The connection
works both ways.

[ticking stops]

[switch ticking]

Lorraine.

You need to come back.

Lorr...
[bones cracking]

Lorraine?

You need to break
the connection.

Drop her hand.

Lorraine, let go of her hand.



[Lorraine gasps]

[both breathing heavily]

Ed...

She knows who we are.

[thunder rumbling]

[sighs in relief]



Oh, we're so sorry.

How's Arne?

He'll be all right.
They got him sedated.

We got the casefile.

There's got to be something here that
connects these girls back to him.

That's great.

I got something
to show you, too.

I found it in the Stregheria.
It's early Renaissance.

The Church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft.

Now...

my Latin is rusty, but...
I think this...

is talking about
a human sacrifice.

One by murder
and the other by suicide.

Does it say how to stop it?

Yeah, it looks like...

you can break the curse by destroying
the altar it was cast from.

But...

this part looks like Aramaic.

This next part,
I can't read it.

But you stopped her.
Maybe she'll give up now.

She can't.

Once started, the curse
must be completed.

Her soul depends on it.

We'll find another way.

Was there anything
in your vision

that might help us
find her altar?

It was cold.

There was water dripping
from the ceiling.

I think I heard a train.

But it sounded strange somehow.
Like, um...

I don't know, muffled?

Well, maybe it was underground.

Could be. I don't know where.

This woman targeted
David and Jessica.

Maybe there's
a connection there.

Let me take a look at the...

<i>Take a look at the...</i>

<i>file.</i>

[thunder rumbling]

[groans softy]

Lorraine?

[leaves rustling]

Lorraine?

Lorraine!

[breathing heavily]

[indistinct clatter]

[breathing heavily]

Where is she?

You know, the two of you have
gathered quite the collection.

If you hurt her...

Oh, don't worry, Mr. Warren.

You're so close.

I'd hate for you
to give up now.

[loud thud]


[door creaking]


[roars]
He who calls forth the water of the sea!

The Lord of Hosts is His name!

Deliver Thy servant

from all the workings
of unclean spirits!

Fear and flee, unclean spirit!

Ed!
[breathing heavily]

Ed.

I'm sorry.

Ed, it was her!

It was her.

[Drew] Ed, what the hell is going on?
Help me find it!

Find what?



Ed!

She was here!
She was in our house!

When did these get here?

They just arrived yesterday

while you guys
were driving home.

They were fresh
when they got here.



to find this woman.

We've identified the curse

and now we have
Jessica's casefile.

There has to be
something in here.

Okay, I'm gonna take the book
to be translated.

There has to be a clue about
where we can find the altar.


You should go be with Arne.

He's gonna need you tonight
more than ever.

Ask Father Newman for help.

Drew, you and me are gonna
tear into those files.

We've got to find a link
between these cases.

And a Satanist's power
is strongest at night. So...

Let's hope she doesn't
try anything before then.

They've stopped his sedation.

He'll be coming around soon.

in these interviews.

Her friends barely saw her
after she got back from college.

Didn't that
seem strange to you?

I mean, we're here,

the Glatzels live here,
just 15 minutes away.

But Jessica lived
180 miles from here.

Why is this one so far away?

Hey, where did Jessica
find her totem?

I just saw something
about that.

It was in an interview
with her parents.

It was in a box.

"She brought it back home
in a box from college."

Where'd she go to college?

Fairfield.

This woman lives in the area.

Still a lot of ground to cover.

Yeah, but not
a lot of train tracks.

Remember Lorraine's vision?
She said she heard a train.

What time was it?

Maybe we can start
eliminating some of these.

close to midnight.

either of these two.

The commuter lines
don't run that late.

That just leaves
this freight line

that crosses the river here.

The river.

Oh, dear God.

Mrs. Warren.

I'm sorry, Father,
we tried calling,

but we couldn't reach you.

We were hoping you'd help us
translate a passage from this book.

Of course. Come in.

Thank you.

Give me your keys.
You stay here, call the police.

to tell them?

Anything,
just get 'em out there!

[door shuts]


It says, the curse needs three
victims to be complete.

It refers to them as...

"The child, the lover
and the man of God."

The embodiment of God's work.

Purity, love, faith.

Has there been another?

It's Ed. It's my husband.

Last night we found a totem
in his office.

That is unfortunate.

Here, come with me.

There's something
I need to show you.

[floorboard creaking]

Father?

I've been here many years...

starting when I was a priest.

The church
used this mill for storage.

It's where they put the things
that they were afraid of.

Things they didn't understand.

You had a child?

Her mother died in childbirth.

The Church couldn't know.

So I raised her here,
in secret.

It was just the two of us.

Our happiness
filled this house.

I continued my studies
into the occult.

I wanted to protect her
from all this.

Instead I created
a fascination.

We must be careful

how our obsessions are passed
to our children.

"He who dwells in the shelter
of the most high

will rest in the shadow
of the Almighty.

I will say of the Lord,

'He is my refuge
and my fortress,

my God, in whom I trust.'"

It's just the wiring.

You know, state building.


Arne.

What is it?

She's... she's close.

You knew?

We came to you for help
and you knew this whole time?

She's my daughter.

I couldn't...

I didn't want to see.

After all these years,

I thought she'd come back
to me again.

And now I know
the real reason she's here.

There are tunnels
under this land.

She would explore them
as a child.

Her altar must be down there.

It's the only thing
that can break her curse.

We need to destroy it.

[door creaking]

She's here.


I failed as a priest.

And I failed as a father.

Please, God,
don't let me fail...

[breathing heavily]


[breathing heavily]

[footsteps approaching]


Lorraine!

[Lorraine in the distance] Ed!

Lorraine!

Lorraine!

Ed?

Ed!

Lorraine!






[breathing heavily]


[Lorraine shrieks]



Look at me.

Open your eyes.

[shushing softly]

Look at me.


Look at me.

Open your eyes and look at me.

Open up.

[Lorraine screams]
[grunts]

Lorraine!

Lorraine!

Lorraine!

Lorraine?

Ed!



Ed?

Ed?

[Ed grunting]
[crashing]


[Arne screaming]

It's happening.
Now?

Now.

[praying in Latin]


[Ed grunts]
Ed, stop!

Ed, I'm begging you!

[Ed grunts]

Ed! Stop!

[screams]
[glass shattering]

[siren wailing]

[Arne screaming]

[bones cracking]

Arne!

Arne, please. It's okay.

Our Father who art in heaven

hallowed be thy name...
No, Arne. It's okay! Please!

...thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

on earth as it is in heaven.
Arne, it's okay!

Ed, I'm begging you!

I'm begging you, remember me!

[breathing heavily] Stop!



Ed, stop! [screams]

[Lorraine whispers] <i>Ed, please.</i>

<i>Remember me.</i>

Oh, my God! Guards!

...and lead us not
into temptation

but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom...
Arne, it's okay.

...the power and the glory...
[roars inhumanly]

...now and forever, amen!

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name,

thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

on earth as it is in heaven.
No, Arne!

Arne? Arne, what are you doing?

[Father Newman
continues praying]

What are you doing? Stop it!

What are you doing?
Father Newman, help him!

Please... Guards!

Please! Stop it!

Please help him!

You're not gonna do this!

This is wrong and you know it!


Father Newman... No, no.

What's happening?

Please, Father, make it stop!


Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

thy kingdom come...

No, no, no! Arne, no!

Arne, stop, please! Stop it!

Don't do this, Arne,
I love you!

No...

And lead us
not into temptation,

but deliver us from evil!

[Lorraine panting]

[grunts]
[screams]


Ed... Remember me.

<i>She tried to
turn you against me.</i>

<i>Because, she thinks our love
is our weakness.</i>

<i>But it's not.</i>

<i>It's not.</i>

<i>It's our strength.</i>

<i>Now, open your eyes.</i>

Arne? Arne, are you okay?

Oh, my God! [cries]

Oh, my God.

[Ed grunts, pants]

Your curse is broken.

[bones cracking]


You promised a demon a soul.

[grunts]
[bones cracking]

And it can't go back to hell
without one.

Oh, my God.

It's okay. It's over.

Please say it's over...

[Ed grunting]

Hon... I...

I forgot my pills.

[breathing heavily]

[siren wailing]
