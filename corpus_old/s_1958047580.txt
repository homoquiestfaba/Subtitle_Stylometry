The forests of Pandora...

hold many dangers.

But the most dangerous thing...

about Pandora...

is that you may grow
to love her too much.

We sing the songcords to remember.

Each bead...

a story in our life.

A bead for the
birth of our son.

Neteyam!

Neteyam!

A bead...

when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.

Born of Grace's avatar.

A daughter whose
conception was a total mystery.

A bead...

for the first
communion with Eywa.

The People say...

we live in Eywa...

and Eywa lives in us.

The Great Mother...

holds all her children...

in her heart.

Happiness is simple.

But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code?

When I first met your father...

...I was trying to kill him.

It was love at first sight.

Before I knew it, we had four.

When we sent the Sky
People back to Earth...

a few of 'em stayed.

Science guys,
loyal to the Na'vi.

And then there was Spider.

He was just stuck here.

Too young for a cryo-capsule.

You little wild man.

See you, Norm!

Orphaned by the war...

he was raised by the lab guys.

Spider, take your spare!

I'm just going to the village!

He wasn't part of our family.

He was like a stray cat.

Just always around.

Inseparable from our kids.

To Neytiri...

he would always be alien.

One of them.

He belongs with his own kind.

It's mine!

I had it first.

Why should I let you have it?

Took a few years to get the
language through my thick skull.

But now when I hear it...

it might as well be English.

I hate you!

Well, I hate you
times infinity, Lo'ak!

Penis face!

Hey! Hey!
That's enough.

Don't make me
come over there.

He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

There he is.

There you go.
Go get it!

Yeah!

Hey, Neteyam,
the mighty fisherman.

There you go. Good boy.

Wow, that's a big one.

By the rocks.

Right where you said.

How tall is he?

-He's... that tall.
-He's tall!

Goes by too fast.

Like a dream.

-Kiri.
-Bro, come on.

Come on.

Smile, skxawng.

Happiness is simple.

Like date night.

Time away from the kids.

But the thing
about happiness...

it can vanish
in a heartbeat.

A new star in the night.

It could only mean one thing.

Ships. Decelerating.

And Sky People returning.

ONE YEAR LATER

Pulse 168.

Yeah, here it comes.

You're just fine.

Just lie still.

Stay calm.

Yep. Pupillary
reflex is good.

Get that out of his face.

Colonel...

can you hear me?

Colonel?

You need to lie
back down, sir.

Sedate him!
Sedate him!

Get outta here.

Go, go, go!

Get security!

-Grab him!
-Grab him!

Hold him!

Calm down!

Colonel, stand down!

Colonel...

it's me!

Corporal Wainfleet!

Lyle?

That you?

Yes, sir.
And Z Dog.

And Fike.

I'm all right.
Let me go.

I'm all right.

Well...

ain't this a bitch.

Stand by. Two minutes to
Pandora insertion. Secure for Delta V.

All right. Umbilical's clear.

Pulse ox 89.

In case you haven't figured it
out yet, you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.

Only younger,
taller, bluer...

and not nearly
as good-lookin'.

In two hours,
I fly a mission...

against the
Na'vi's stronghold.

The powers that be thought it prudent
that I do this backup just in case.

And if you are
watchin' it, well...

it means that I did
get my ticket punched.

Hey, Parker...

just what the hell am I
supposed to say now?

Just remind him
how this works.

Here.

So see this? This is all your
memories and your personality.

We're gonna send
this back to Earth...

where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.

We're gonna imprint
you with it, and then...

Hey, hey, hey.

Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?

Hurry it up.
Hurry it up.

Anyway,
the idea...

is to get the minds of the
saltiest on-world operators.

Yeah, like Corporal
Wainfleet over there...

and your humble
narrator into...

recombinant bodies.

You're a
recom now, Colonel...

loaded with my
memories and my charm.

What you won't
remember is my death...

because it
hasn't happened yet...

and it ain't gonna.

-Damn right.
-Hell yeah.

Well, whatever happened...

if you're any clone of mine, you'll
be lookin' for some payback.

And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.

Remember, kid...

a Marine
can't be defeated.

Oh, you can kill us...

but we'll just
regroup in hell.

Semper fi.

Ground team, go!

Take this! Go!

Let's go. Two
minutes, people. Let's go.

Bro, we have got
to get down there.

No way!
Dad will skin us!

Come on.
Don't be a wuss.

Lo'ak!

Get back
here, you...

Taking the
whole case!

We're taking mags,
the RPGs, the stingers.

Bro, let's go. Come on!

Okay, let's go!

Move! Take that!

Take these weapons.

Here, boy. Go!

You don't even
know how to use it.

Dad taught me.

Gunship's
inbound!

Bro, come on!

Lo'ak, where are you?

Neteyam!

Easy, easy, you okay?

-Yeah.
-Where's your brother?

-That way.
-Where is he? Where?

Get outta here!

Go on!

Neteyam!

Oh, no.

Oh, no, no, no.

Oh, God.

Dad?

What are you doin' here, boy?
What the hell were you thinkin'?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, sir.

We are not in Kansas anymore.

We are going to Pandora.

Now...

I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

Why so blue?

For our sins
in our past life...

we have been
brought back...

in the form
of our enemy.

That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.

And with
our training...

that's a pretty
potent mix.

Do we have a
mission yet?

Indeed
we do.

Our mission is to
hunt down and kill...

the leader of the
Na'vi insurgency.

The one they call
Toruk Makto.

Jake Sully.

Yeah!

Attack, attack!

Got ya!

Tuk!

Come on!

I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

Skxawng.

No, seriously.

And the animals
respect me more.

They don't think
of me as human.

Wait.
You're human?

They're
coming!

HIGH CAMP, OMATIKAYA STRONGHOLD

They're coming!

Kiri, Spider!

The war party's coming back!

Come on, come on.

Let's go, come on.

-Mom!
-Tuk...

-Mom.
-Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

Fall in.

You're supposed to be spotters.

You spot bogeys, and you call 'em in.

From a distance!

Does any of this sound familiar?
Get here!

Jesus. I let you two
geniuses fly a mission...

and you disobey direct orders.

Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded? Please?

My brother is wounded.

It's fine.

-Tuk, go with her. Go.
-Dad.

Sir. I take full responsibility.

Yeah, you do.

That's right.

'Cause you're the older
brother. You gotta act like it.

MaJake.

Your son is actually bleeding.

Mother, it's fine. I...

Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

Yes, sir.

You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

Now, see to the ikran.
All of 'em.

Yes, sir.

And get that crap off your face.

Aw, want a kiss on the boo-boo?

-Give him this.
-Okay.

I would use yalna bark.

Here, drink.

Oh, you would?

And who is Tsahik?

You are, Grand... Move!

You are, Grandmother.
But yalna bark is better.

It stings less.

Mighty Warrior.

What?

Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

It is very hard on them.

I know.

You are very hard on them.

I'm their father.
It's my job.

This is not a squad.

It is a family.

I thought we'd lost them.

Hey, man.
How's it going?

Hey, Spider.

Your ass is mine.

I'm right here.

Avatars only...

go around!

Sorry.

Yeah. Those blue stripes
don't make you any bigger, bro.

Yeah, well, I can still kick your ass.

Hell of a day.

Long run.

Real hysterical, guys.

You know what really sucks though?

Is you can breathe Earth air for hours...

and I can only breathe
your air for, like, 10 seconds.

Yeah, Monkey Boy,
that really sucks.

For you.

-Hi, Max.
-Hey, kids.

Hey. What's up, Max?

What's up, Norm?

Hi, Ma.

Maybe I'm just losing it out here...

but I'm seeing real evidence...

of a systemic response on a global level.

I can't...

I won't use the term "intelligence." It's...

maybe "awareness" is a better word.

It's like the entire biosphere of Pandora...

is aware...

and capable of this cognitive response.

Oh, crap,
I can't say that.

They'll crucify me.

I mean, I need to say...

So who do you think
knocked her up?

Pretty sure it was Norm.

Totally.

You do not deserve to live.

No, no, no.
Think about it, right?

I mean, he's the teacher's pet.

He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

I would kill myself.

I would drink acid.

Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

Hey.

See, I'm thinkin'...

their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

Gross!

Guys.

I mean, sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

Whatever.

Don't even remember him.

No, Spider.

-Dude.
-Spider...

You are not him.

BRIDGEHEAD CITY

Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.

Do not stop.

Masks off.

Sir...

this is the General.

General Ardmore.

Good to meet you, Colonel.

I've heard good things...

but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

Walk with me.

The new ops
center is over here.

That just came online.

These Swarm Assemblers,
they can put up a building in six days.

We have done more here in a year
than in the previous 30 years.

We're not here to run a mine, Colonel.

As On-World Commander...

I have been charged
with a greater mission.

Earth is dying.

Our task here is to tame this frontier.

Nothing less than to make Pandora...

the new home for humanity.

But before we can do that...

we need to pacify the hostiles.

Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

His strikes are well-planned.

He's got tight coordination
between his ground and air assets.

His forces are hitting our
outlying sites. The mines, pipelines...

cutting off our supply chain.

And they hit a maglev two days ago.

Any intel on Sully's...

base of operations?

Yeah.
Give me the mountains.

It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

We only get 10 minutes
in enemy airspace...

they are all over us.

Colonel...

we believe your Blue Team will
be perceived as indigenous...

and will not trigger...

the immune response.

And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

The hard way.

Outstanding.

We're entering hostile airspace.

Copy that.

-Bro!
-Go, Monkey Boy!

Guys, wait up!

Tuk!
Keep up!

Okay, okay.

Bro, why'd you bring her anyway?

She's such a cry baby.

She's all, "I'm telling."

"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield."

"I'll tell Mom if you
don't let me come."

Don't pick on her.

Come on.

Oh, sick!

Are there any
dead bodies up there?

Bro, check it out.
Come on.

No shit.

Kiri.

Kiri.

Kiri...

Kiri, hey.

Hey.

Are you okay?

I was doing that
thing again, wasn't I?

Yeah, you were.

Kiri!

-Kiri!
-Kiri, we have to get back.

All right, come on.

What is it?

We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

It's way too big for a human.

-Avatars?
-Maybe...

but they're for sure not ours.

What are you doing?

I'm tracking.

Watch your six.

Clear.

Perimeter up.

Damn.

We are never supposed to come here.

Dad is going to ground you.

Can you stop?

For life.

Bro, we have got to
check this out.

Let's go.

Bro...

that's where your dad and my dad...

fought.

That's your dad's actual suit.

Holy shit.

Lyle, see if you can...

pull some data
off that dash cam.

That thing's deader
than shit, Colonel.

So were we.

All right.

I gotta call this in.

No, bro, we're gonna
get in trouble.

Let's go.

Devil Dog, Devil Dog,
this is Eagle Eye, over.

Eagle Eye.
Send your traffic.

I got eyes on some guys.

They look like avatars...

but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.

There's six of them.
Over.

What's your pos?
Over.

We're at the old shack.

Who's "we"?

Me, Spider, Kiri...

and Tuk.

Son, you listen to
me very carefully.

You pull back right now.

Do not make a sound.

You get the hell out of there.

Move! You copy?

Yes, sir, moving out.

See, I told you!

Go, go.

Dad...

I know a quick way!

You're going to be
in so much trouble.

Kiri, stop.

Guys, come on.

It's almost eclipse, come on.

Put it down!
Down!

Put it down or
I'll shoot you!

With me.

Drop it!

Right now!

Do not move!
Put your hands up!

Put it down. Put it down.

Spider.

Get 'em!
Get 'em!

Get over here! Come on!

Get down!

Stop fighting.

Don't move!

Check 'em for weapons!

Kiri!

Be calm...

Shut up.

Don't move.

What have we here?

Hey, Colonel...

check it out.

Four fingers.

We got a half-breed.

Shit...

Show me
your fingers.

You're his,
aren't you?

You're his,
all right.

Where is he?

Sorry, I don't speak your language...

...to buttholes.

Where is your father?

No!

Really?

You wanna play
it this way?

Shut up!

Kiri!

No!
Stop!

Hey! Hey, don't touch her!

Hey!

Don't hurt her, please.

Don't move.

What's your name, kid?

Spider...

Socorro.

Miles?

Nobody calls me that.

Well,
I'll be damned...

Well, I figured they
sent you back to Earth.

They can't put
babies in cryo, dipshit.

What are we doin', boss?

Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

Blue One, Iron Sky,
send your traffic.

We are standing by
for extract, over.

Take us in.

Dragonfly comin' left...

we are go for extract.

Be advised...

we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

Let us go!

Shut up.

Sit tight, Blue One...

we're inbound to your pos.

That's bingo in ten.

We're on the clock.

-Sit!
-Come on, in the dirt!

-Feet up!
-Get down on the ground!

Lyle...

get me some audio on this.

Shut your mouth.

Don't look up!

That's Sully's woman.

She's an animal.

Give it up, Quaritch.

Sully.

-It's all over.
-Son of a bitch.

Nothin's over
while I'm breathin'.

I kinda hoped you'd say that.

No, no, you stay
with the ikran.

But, Dad...

I'm a warrior like you.

I'm supposed to fight.

Neteyam.

I'm not gonna say it again.

Yes, sir.

Yeah, there's nothin' after that.

You want us to recover these remains?

Blue One, stand by ready.

We are three minutes out.

Heads up, three minutes.

Watch our six.

Shut up!

Shut up!

Contact rear!

Contact rear!

Lo'ak!

Shit.

You little shit.

Lo'ak!

-Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
-Get back here!

Run!

Grab 'em!

Come on!

Cover!

Come on!

That you,
Mrs. Sully?

I recognize your calling card.

Why don't you come
on out, Mrs. Sully?

You and I,
we got some...

unfinished business.

Demon!

I will kill you as many
times as I have to!

I guess you and the Corporal
have been pretty...

busy, haven't you?

Dropped yourself a whole litter of...

half-breeds.

Na'vi!

Go, go, go!

You okay?
You okay, boy?

Yeah.

Okay. With me.
Ready? Ready?

Yes, sir!

Move!

Come on!

Go, go, go!

Flank out. Get after 'em!

Spider?

Spider!

Kiri!

Spider.

Come! Come on.

Spider. He's down there.

No.

Ma'am,
we're at bingo.

Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

Blue One...

fall back.

Fall back!

Fall back, fall back!

Move out! Move!

Move, move, move!

-Kiri!
-Spider!

Come, come.

No.

Come!

Go, go, go.
Come on. Let's go.

Hey. Hey, it's
okay. You hurt?

-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm okay.

-Tuk, you hurt?
-Daddy!

Okay, we're clear.

We're clear.
Everyone okay?

-Mom!
-Tuk.

It's okay.
It's okay. We're okay.

Oh, thank you, Great
Mother. Thank you.

Thank you.

Where's Spider?

They took him.

They took him.

Okay. It's all
right, baby girl.

All right? He's
a tough kid.

All right.

He's gonna be okay.

We're all gonna be okay.

Goddamn!

Come on!

Let me out
of here!

He's completely feral.

Thinks he's
one of them.

This thing.
This Quaritch.

Whatever
he is...

-What's going on?
-He can walk right in here.

He can walk right
under Eywa's nose.

-This is our family. This is our home.
-This is about our family.

This is about
our little ones.

I cannot. You cannot ask this.

I cannot leave
my People.

I will not.

He's hunting us.

He's targeting
our family.

You cannot
ask this!

The children. Everything they've
ever known. The forest.

This is
our home!

He had
our children.

He had 'em
under his knife!

My father gave me...

this bow
as he lay dying.

And he said
protect the People.

You're
Toruk Makto!

This will protect the People!

Quaritch
has Spider.

And that kid
knows everything.

He knows our
whole operation...

and he can lead
them right in here.

If the People harbor
us, they will die.

Do you
understand?

Look, I
got nothing.

I got
no plan...

But I can protect this family.

That I can do.

I know
one thing.

Wherever we go...

this family is our fortress.

Where is Jake Sully?

I don't know!

We know that
you know.

I don't know!

Just form a picture...

in your mind.

Is it one of the
floating mountains?

Let me out of here!

He's fighting us.
Give us a minute.

I don't know!

Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

I don't know!

Look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

Which clans would be harboring him?

I don't know!

You're gonna
have to kill me!

Watch this.

You're peaking all
over the prefrontal.

It's not gonna stop...

until you give
us something.

Where is he?

I don't know,
you buttholes! Okay?

I don't know!

General, let me try
the personal angle.

He's not your son.

Easy, tiger.

Easy.

We good?

Kid, you
got heart.

Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.

But you gave
them nothin'.

I respect that.

I thought you
might want this.

That's Colonel
Miles Quaritch.

Deceased.

Killed
in action.

I'm not
that man.

But I do have
his memories...

enough to
know that...

well, he wasn't
always the best father.

But that's
not an apology.

I'm not your father.
Technically...

you and I, we're
nothin' to each other.

But...

I can
help you.

I can get you
outta here.

I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

I know you'd never
do that. You're loyal...

and I
admire loyalty.

Just ride along.

Otherwise, I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

This is like stones
in my heart.

Tarsem is wise
for his years.

He will be
a strong Olo'eyktan.

The leader must die.

So the leader
can be born.

Toruk Makto
will disappear.

The People
will be safe.

A father protects.

It's what gives
him meaning.

One life ends.

Another begins.

Tuk.

The sea clans are a
world unto themselves.

Thousands of islands.

An unknown territory into which
we could just vanish without a trace.

Are we there yet?

AWA'ATLU, A METKAYINA VILLAGE

Hey...

leave it.

On me.

Tuk.

Be nice.

Be nice.

Hey.

Easy.
Just be cool.

Look.
What is that?

Is that supposed
to be a tail?

It's too small.

How are they
supposed to swim?

Do not.
Rotxo, Aonung.

Hey.

Tonowari was the chief
of the Metkayina...

the Reef People.

I See you,
Tonowari.

Jakesully.

I knew him as
a tough leader.

But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.

I See you, Ronal.

Tsahik of
the Metkayina.

I See you,
Ronal.

Why do you come
to us, Jakesully?

We seek uturu.

Yes, sanctuary
for my family.

We are
Reef People.

You are
Forest People.

Your skills will
mean nothing here.

Well, we will learn
your ways. Am I right?

Yes.

Their arms
are thin.

Mom.

Their tails...

are weak.

You will be
slow in the water.

These children...

-are not even true Na'vi.
-Dad.

Yes, we are!

They have
demon blood!

Look. Look.

Look, I was born of the Sky
People, and now I am Na'vi.

All right?
You can adapt.

We will adapt.

Okay?

My husband
was Toruk Makto.

He led the clans to...

victory against the Sky People.

This you
call victory?

Hiding among
strangers?

It seems Eywa has
turned her back on you...

Chosen One.

I apologize for
my mate. She's...

Do not
apologize for me.

...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

Jake.

Toruk Makto is a
great war leader.

All Na'vi people know his story.

But we Metkayina...

-Dad.
-...are not at war.

We cannot let you
bring your war here.

I'm done
with war.

Okay?

I just want to keep
my family safe.

Uturu has
been asked.

Do we have to go?

We'll be okay.

Toruk Makto and his
family will stay with us.

Treat them as our
brothers and sisters.

Now, they do not
know the sea.

So they will be
like babies...

taking their...

first breath.

Teach them our ways, so they
do not suffer the shame of being...

useless.

Okay, what
do we say?

Thank you.

Thank you.

My son, Aonung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

-Father, why do...
-It is decided.

Come. I will show
you our village.

This way.

Tuk, let's go.

Just up here.

This is for you.

Your new home.

Yeah, this will work.

This is great.

It's nice, right?

Okay, Sullys, fall in.

Remember?

Family
meeting.

Come on. Take
a knee. Let's go.

Kiri.

What?

Okay.

I need
you kids

on your best
behavior.

I mean it.

Learn fast.
Pull your weight.

Don't cause trouble.
You got it?

Yes, sir.

I want to
go home.

Oh, Tuk.

Tuk, this is
our home now.

Now we're gonna
get through this.

We're gonna
get through this

if we have each
other's backs. All right?

What does your
father always say?

Sullys stick
together.

That's right.
Sullys stick together.

Now this time
with some feeling.

Yeah.

Sullys stick
together.

Sullys stick
together.

Come on.

Swim together with us.

What's wrong with them?

Those guys are bad divers.

Stop.

They're learning.

Are you all right?

You're too fast!

Wait for us.

Just breathe.

Breathe.

You are not
good divers.

Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

Come on, bro.

We don't speak this
finger talk, guys.

We don't know
what you're saying.

I will teach you.

-Where is Kiri?
-Kiri?

-Who?
-Kiri.

Where is Kiri?

Did you see her?

Get on the ship...

find a seat, and
keep out of the way.

Let's go!

Chop-chop.

Sweet.

Whoa, hold on
there, hotshot!

You listen up.

There's a tracker
built in that mask.

We hit the ground,
and you take off...

I'll have you back
in two minutes...

and I will give you a
old-school ass-whippin'.

Understood?

Understood?

Yes, sir.

We up?

Team's up.

All right, listen up.

Jake Sully's gone to ground.

Don't matter.

Wherever he is,
we'll find him...

and his batshit crazy wife, too.

To do so...

we go Na'vi.

Full tilt, all the way.

That means we...

eat Na'vi.
We ride Na'vi.

Think Na'vi.

And that starts with
speaking the language.

You call that speaking the language?

You sound like a three year old!

All right, smart guy.

You just went from bein'
our monkey mascot...

to official interpreter.

These are ilu.

If you want to live here...

you have to ride.

Make the bond gently.

Feel his breath.

Feel his strength.

Hold here.

Hold on.

You all right...

Forest Boy?

This is a warrior's mount.

Not easy to master.

Perhaps you should...

start with an ilu.

Nah.
This one.

Now remember...

when you dive back
in, good position.

Very important.

I got this.

That's it, okay.

Steady.

Ah, shit.

I love her already.

Breathe in.

And breathe out.

Imagine flickering a flame.

You must slow down
your heartbeat.

Breathe in.

Breathe from down here.

Breathe out slowly.

Lo'ak, your heartbeat is fast.

-Sorry.
-Try to focus.

-Okay.
-Breathe in.

And breathe out.

Let your mind go clear.

You are learning to breathe.

Come on!
Keep up, losers!

I got this.

What?

Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

Jake Sully did it the hard way?

What do you think?

What are we doin', Colonel?

This is gonna be good.

All right, move up.

It's you and me, cupcake.

Did I mention you're
supposed to tie the mouth shut first?

Thanks a lot, kid!

Move up,
move up!

You see 'em?

All right, let's go.
We're Oscar Mike.

Come on.

Let's go.
We're outta here.

Yeah!

That's right!

Yeah, Colonel!
Get some!

Yeah, Colonel!

Who's up next?

The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

The sea is around you...

and in you.

The sea is your home...

before your birth...

and after your death.

Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.

Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.

The sea gives...

and the sea takes.

Water connects all things.

Life to death.

Darkness...

to light.

I got it!

You did it!

It gives breath under water.

What is she doing?

I don't know.

She's just looking at the sand.

What'd you say?

Are you some kind of... freak?

He asked if you are a freak.

No.

Are you sure?

I mean, you're
not even real Na'vi.

Look at these hands.

I mean, look at them...

Hey!

Back off, fishlips!

Oh, another
four-fingered freak.

Look at his little baby tail!

Don't touch me!

Baby tail!

Leave us alone!

He's not normal.

Look at his tail.

Aw, baby tail!

It is so cute!

You heard
what she said.

Leave them alone.

Ah, big brother come...

Back off.

Now.

Smart choice.

And from now on...

I need you to
respect my sister.

Let's go.

Buh-bye!

Look at them.

They're all freaks.

The whole family.

Lo'ak.

I got this, bro.

I know this hand is funny.

Look, I'm a freak.
An alien.

But it can do
something really cool.

Watch.

First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

Okay? Then...

It's called a
punch, bitch!

Don't ever touch my sister again.

Yeah! Aonung!
Show him!

Come here!

Hey!
Hey!

Stop this!

Stop it!

So stupid!

Ow, my tail!

My ear!
Let go!

He's got my ear!

What was the
one thing I asked?

The one thing!

-Stay out of trouble.
-Stay out of trouble.

-Right.
-It was my fault.

I don't think so.

You gotta stop takin' the
heat for this knucklehead.

Look, Dad. Aonung
was picking on Kiri.

He called her a freak.

Go apologize to Aonung.

What?

He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?

I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.

Just go.

Hey.

So what'd the
other guys look like?

Worse.

That's good.

A lot worse.

Get outta here.

What is wrong?

Nothing. I'm fine.

Why should I not be fine?

Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

Oh, Kiri.

Ah, what's tree
boy doing here?

I'm sorry
I hit you.

So many times.

We should
be friends.

Come hunting with us.

Outside
the reef.

It's where
the men hunt.

No way.
I'm not allowed.

I must be asking
the wrong brother.

Let's do it.

Come on! Come on!

Yeah!

Keep up, Forest Boy!

Yeah!

THREE BROTHERS ROCKS

Hey, you lived!

That was
insane, cuz!

This way.

I know a
good spot.

Call the fish.

What a moron!

Hey, guys!

Hey!

Aonung!

Come on, this isn't funny!

Hey,
Aonung!

Holy shit.

You're a tulkun.

You saved my life.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

They hurt you, didn't they?

I'll try to
pull it out.

Just trust me, okay?

Friends?

That's right, we're
friends. Friends.

Bro!

I'm sorry.

So, what is it,
baby girl?

You missin'
Spider?

-Yeah.
-Yeah?

But that's
not it.

Okay...

So what is it?

I feel her, Dad.

You feel who?

Eywa.

I hear her breathing.

I hear her heartbeat.

She's so close.

She's just there...

like a word about
to be spoken.

I know you think I'm crazy.

You're not crazy,
baby girl.

So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

Mighty.

Tell him what
you told me!

You like lookin' at the stars?

You know, my dad
came from a star.

That one.

Right there.

Lo'ak!

Oh, man. I'm in trouble.

Go.

I will see you again.

-The boy has returned!
-It is the Sully boy.

-They found the boy.
-They found him.

Hey, hey.

Let's have a look at you. Okay.

He's fine.
He's fine...

yeah.

Just a few scratches.

I pray for the strength that I will not...

pluck the eyeballs out of my youngest son!

No.

My son knows better
than to take him outside the reef.

The blame is his.

Okay, let's go.

No.

This is not Aonung's fault.

This was my idea.

Aonung tried to talk me out of it.

Really.

Come on.

I'm sorry.

Come on.

I got this.

Is this true?

Aonung. What were you thinking?

Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

-That's all I was trying to...
-I don't want to hear it.

Dad...

You brought shame to this family.

Can I go now?

Any more trouble,
I jerk a knot in your tail.

You read me?

Yes, sir.
Lima Charlie.

Where were you?

Yeah.

What happened to "keep
an eye on your brother"?

Sorry, sir.

Why did you speak for me?

Because I know what it's like...

to be one big disappointment.

I wish I'd been there.

The ocean blessed
you with a gift, brother.

The tulkun have not returned yet.

And anyway, no tulkun is ever alone.

Well, this one was.

He had a missing fin.

Like a stump.

On the left side.

Poor tulkun.

Payakan.

Who's Payakan?

A young bull who went rogue.

He's outcast.
Alone.

And he has a missing fin.

They say he is a killer.

-No, no.
-He killed Na'vi...

and other tulkun.

Not here...

but far to the south.

No, he's no killer.

You are lucky to be alive.

I'm telling you guys.

He saved my life.

He's my friend.

My baby bro!

The Mighty Warrior...

who faced the killer tulkun...

and lived to tell about it, huh?

You guys aren't listening.

-Lo'ak, I'm listening.
-Lo'ak, come back.

You skxawngs.

Payakan!

Payakan!

Payakan!

It's good to see you.

Why are you outcast?

What happened?

It's too painful.

I trust you.

You can trust me.

Bro, that's disgusting!

Go faster!

We are here.

This is the Cove of the Ancestors.

Our most sacred place.

Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.

This is it.

This is the Spirit Tree.

My beautiful daughter.

Hi, Ma.

I'm so happy to see you.

But you look troubled.

My sweet girl.

It will be okay.

What is it, baby?

Why am I different?

What does the Great
Mother want from me?

Who was my father?

Oh, my darling.

No!

Come on.

What is wrong?
What is it?

It was a seizure.

Is she breathing?

Is she breathing?

Get her to the village!

Hurry!

Let's go!
Let's move!

Tuk, come.

-Hi!
-It's good to see you.

Let's get the gear.
Neteyam!

Neteyam, keep
them back!

How is she?

She's still unconscious.

There's no bleed.

There's no fracture.

No effects of hypoxia.

The brain looks good.

But we still have this interictal
activity right here in the prefrontal.

-Okay.
-She's definitely had a seizure.

-I think we can rule out toxins.
-So what is it?

I see that I am
not needed here.

You are Tsahik!

Remove
these things.

Out!

You have
done nothing!

Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

Tuktirey.

She said that she can feel Eywa.
She can hear her heartbeat.

-That's it.
-What?

That is classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

-Epilepsy?
-Yep.

You see visions.
You get...

states of religious ecstasy
like the kind she's describing.

Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

You definitely can't let
her do that anymore.

What? Ever?

Jake.

If she seizes
underwater again...

it could kill her.

You're awake!

Kiri, my sweet child.

Oh, my sweet little girl.

Okay, this one.

"I See you."

That's what I
just said, isn't it?

Not "Naati. Ngaati."

All right. Like comin'
out your nose or something.

Boss...

long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

A rogue gunship.

Where?

Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.

Hang on.

The signal was intermittent,
and they lost it over open water but...

if you project the track...

it hits this island group.

That's hundreds
of islands.

That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

This is our guy.

You give me ships and aircraft,
I'll bring you back his scalp.

Bogies inbound.

Skipper.

-All stop.
-All stop.

All stop. Aye.

Hey.

You Scoresby?

Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

That would
be me.

The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

Never been up there.

You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

Metkayina, mostly. Some
Ta'unui. Maybe fifty villages.

And you
are who?

I'm Ian Garvin.

Marine biologist.

Fifty villages.

A hundred villages.
I don't care. We'll search 'em all.

I hunt tulkun.

That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

I've got quotas to meet.

I'll be nice once.

Then I won't.

Well, if you can't
get out of it...

get into it!

-All crews to stations!
-Hey, don't touch.

Helm, bring her up.

Flight speed.

Flight speed, aye.

What was that?

What's going on?

The tulkun have returned!

Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

In their endless cycle of migration...

the tulkun had come home.

Kiri, come on. Come on!

Tuk, leave me alone.

-Come on!
-What?

What do you want?

Look.

Come on.

Let's go meet them.

Look...

it's my Spirit Sister.

Sister, I See you.

I See you, Sister. I am happy.

Your son is beautiful.

Thank you. How is your baby?

My baby is strong.

I met a boy.

It was a time for stories.

Of their season apart.

Of deaths...

and births.

Of old friends...

and new loves.

TA'UNUI VILLAGE

Children.

Be calm...

my people.

We're looking for weapons...

comms. Any kind of tech.

Get down.

You too.

You see this?

Stay down and shut up!

This man...

We know he is in these islands.

Here? This village?

We are a totally separate clan...

...this man in the reflection...

...is from the forest.

Now what's he saying?

They never saw him.

These are Sea People.

Forest People don't come here.

I ain't buyin' that.

He needs to leave here...

and go to the forest to find this man.

They don't know anything.

Shoot that animal.

What the hell are you doing?

Be calm.

Your ears workin' now?

Be calm!

You see what these can do, huh?

Jake Sully.

Toruk Makto!

He told you he doesn't know!

Put her down!

Get down!

Get down!

Stop!

You make it real clear to him.

He doesn't give up Sully...

we kill the Tsahik.

No, I'm not doin' that.

Is that right?

I'm not gonna be a part of this!

Get down!

These people don't know anything!

They don't know anything!

Don't move!

We really gonna waste her?

Please.

Please don't do this.

This is wrong.

What you're doing here is wrong.

Please.

Burn the hooches.

Hey, light 'em up.

Light 'em up. All of 'em!

Flamethrowers up!

I'm sorry!

I didn't know!

Stop this madness!

I'm sorry.

We're outta here.

Don't touch me!

I'm sorry.

Let's go.

Saddle up.

All right. Let's go.

What's wrong?

Sky People.

They're looking for you, Jakesully.

South.

They have a human...

boy who speaks Na'vi.

Did they kill anybody?

Not yet.

They threaten.

But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

By my order.

We must hunt this demon.

Trap him.

Kill him.

We've gotta be smart.

We gotta be smart.

If we hit Quaritch...

they're gonna
know where we are...

and they're gonna come
here with everything they've got.

Then what is our plan?

That's Toruk Makto!

Head down.

Has he been here?

This shit ain't workin'.

Nah, they're stonewallin' us.

If we turn up the heat...

he's just gonna keep runnin'.

We gotta draw him out.

I'm over it.

I've got quotas to meet.

You wanna hunt?

Let's hunt.

Here? Not here.

There's too many villages.

No.
No, no, no.

Respectfully, sir...

you do not understand...

the kinship bonds...

between the tulkun
and the ocean Na'vi.

It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

If we start hunting here...

the hostiles will come after us.

Exactly.

One hostile...

in particular.

I know how you feel.

I feel all alone too.

Tell me.

Why are you outcast?

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay.

It's okay.

You allowed this.

You allowed him to
bond with the outcast!

Tsireya.

You disappoint me, daughter.

And you...

son of a great warrior...

who has been taught better.

Payakan saved my life, sir.

You don't know him.

No, Lo'ak.

Sit.

Sit.

Sit down!

Hear my words, boy.

In the days of the First Songs...

tulkun fought amongst themselves...

for territory...

and for revenge.

But they came to believe...

that killing,
no matter how justified...

only brings more killing.

So all killing was forbidden.

This is the Tulkun Way.

Payakan...

is a killer, so...

he is outcast.

I'm sorry, sir.

But you're wrong.

Lo'ak.

You speak to Olo'eyktan!

I know what I...

That's enough!

I know what I know.

That's enough.

I'll deal with this one.

This storm will pass.

Lo'ak, I saw something today.

I saw a Forest Boy...

chosen by tulkun.

I am very proud of you.

Payakan didn't kill those boys.

I saw it all.

The demon ship killed his
mother right in front of him.

He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

to attack the ship.

And they were all killed...

but by the Sky People.
Not by him.

-He's not a killer.
-No, Lo'ak.

By the Tulkun Way, he is.

He bears those deaths.

Does he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

He knows what he did was wrong.
He would never do it again.

We must tell my father...

No. No.

I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

Your father will understand this.

No, he won't.

He doesn't understand anything.

The whole clan hates me.

Demon blood.

Alien. That's all they see.

I See you.

You are Brother of Tulkun.

You are one of us now.

You got my mother?

Mother and calf.
Strong signal. Range 4,000.

Bring it down...

on the hull.

Comin' down, aye.

Foils deployed.

Sub teams...

two minutes!

Let's get in there!

Hatches closed!

Come on, hustle!

Hustle!

Crews to their boats.
Two minutes.

Let's make some bank.

Boat crews!

Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

All boats in! Boats in!

Let's go, baby!

We're rollin'!

Stand by depth charges...

and fire, fire, fire!

What's that?

What are they doin'?

Those are echolocation sensors.

How they navigate.

They have to hold...

them out of the water...

or they'll go deaf.

Picadors!

Get in there!

Go on.

Get in there.
Get up in there!

They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod...

using the sound cannon.

They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly...

and she won't leave the calf.

Do they ever fight back?

Nah, never seen 'em lift a fin.

Tough bastards to kill though.

Sub teams, go!

And release.

Release, release.

There's our gal.

Target in sight.

3-6 is in hot with harpoons.

Here we go, baby.

See, we go in from below...

where there's gaps in the armor.

All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

I'm goin' in.

Get me in close.

Hold her steady.

In range. Arm one.

Arming, target lock.

And one away.

Two's in hot.

-Arm one.
-Arming.

Fire.

Good strike.
Arm two.

Arming.

Two away.

Booyah!

Nice.

3-6, you owe us a beer.

You see, the bags
slow her down...

and keep her up at the surface.

Yeah.

Get on her!

Get me in there.

Straight up on her.

30 meters.

Explosive-tipped harpoon.

Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

Now steady, steady.

Stay with her.

Hold. Hold.

Line's runnin'!

Hold on to your ponytail, Colonel!

Hold back full!

Back full, aye.

Hold her.

She takes an explosive
harpoon to the chest...

and she's still runnin'.

Beautiful.

The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

We drill up through
the hard palate...

into the brain. And...

These are highly intelligent beings.

Probably smarter than us.

Not smarter than me.

That is setting the bar very low.

Hey, I'm the one with the harpoon.

Yep.

How do you know?

That they're smarter than us?

More neurons, more pathways.

Not only are they smarter, they're...

deeply emotional.

More spiritual.

See, this region here corresponds
with our emotional centers...

but proportionally it's much larger.

They have music...

philosophy...

mathematics...

complex language.

Okay.

Here we go.

Show me the money.

So that's what this is all about?

That's it.

Amrita.

Bad luck for the big guys.

This stuff just happens to
stop human aging. Like...

stops it.

Ounce for ounce the
single most valuable...

substance known to man.

This little vial here is worth like...

80 million.

Think fast!

Please don't.

It's never funny.

Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

It's why I drink.

That's all you take?

I mean, you just waste the rest?

Drop the bags.

Let's sink her!

No. Leave the bags.

I want 'em to know it was us.

I charge extra for bein' used as bait.

Her name is Ro'a.

She was my Spirit Sister.

She was a composer of songs.

Much revered.

We would sing together.

She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

The clan were so happy for her.

What is this, Tonowari?

What is this?

My Spirit Sister and her baby...

have been murdered by the Sky People!

This war has come to us.

We knew about this hunting...

of our tulkun people.

But it was over the horizon...

far away.

Now it is here!

No, you don't...

You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.

They don't care about the Great Balance.

We don't answer to Sky People!

Listen. Listen to him.

The Sky People are not gonna stop.

This is only the beginning.

You gotta tell your tulkun to leave.

You gotta tell them to go far away!

Leave?

You live among us...

and you learn nothing!

We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

No, no, no.

If you attack...

if you fight...

then they will destroy you!

They will destroy...

everything that you love.

No!

You hear my words!

Hear my words!

Stay calm.

Stay calm!

Listen to my father.

Damn it!

He speaks the truth.

You tell the tulkun...

that if they're hit
by one of these...

they're marked for death.

And call for me...

I'll silence it.

Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

Right?

Saving your family.

Tell the tulkun.

Go.

Go!

We must fight.

MaJake.

I will not stand and do nothing!

It's a trap.
They want us to hit back.

They're not hunting tulkun.

They're hunting us.

No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

I have to warn Payakan about the pingers.

No.

You've gotta keep
your skxawng ass here.

He's outcast.

There's nobody to warn him but me.

Bro...

why do you always have
to make things so hard?

No.

You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

The perfect little soldier.

Well, I'm not you!

Okay?

I'm not you.

He's my brother.

I'm going.

He's your brother?

No, I'm your brother.

Lo'ak!

Get off me.

Lo'ak!

Come back!

Come on.

He's going to Payakan.

Come back!

There's Lo'ak!
Lo'ak.

Lo'ak!

Lo'ak's going to find Payakan!

Wait up!

Hold on!

-All crews to stations.
-Sound general call.

All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

Brother!

Lo'ak!

Lo'ak!

Wait!

What is it?
What's wrong?

Shit!

Stay calm.
Stay calm.

I got this.

Shit!

Bro, come on!
Help me out!

Hurry, the ship's coming!

They're over there!

Bro, come on!

Bro.

Come on, bro.

Hurry!

Call it in!

Call Dad!

Call Dad!
Just go! Do it!

Just do it.

Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

Did you see where they went?

It's Eagle Eye, do you copy?

-They went outside the reef.
-Yeah, Lo'ak.

Dad!

We're with a tulkun
that's under attack.

Killer ship's inbound.

It's about two klicks out.

Who's with you?

It's all of us.

Aonung and Tsireya too.

We're at Three Brothers Rocks.

You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

All right? You hear me?

Do not engage.
We're comin'.

Yes, sir.

It's getting closer!

-Three, two, pull!
-Pull!

Kids are under attack!

The kids are under attack.
They were defending a tulkun.

It's your kids too.

The demon ship?

Yes!

We gotta go!

Weapons.
Sound the alarm!

You should stay back.

I ride!

Come!

Sub teams, hatches close.

Two-minute warning.

Aonung!

Hurry up! Come on!

Bro, hurry up!

Go, go, go!

Pull! Now!

-Everybody! Together!
-Pull!

I'll be damned.

Sully's kids.

Let's roll.
Not you.

Saddle up.

Range is 700 meters.

Pinger signal is good.

Pull, harder!

Pull!

Pull, harder!

Go!

It's out!
Kiri, it's out!

Go.
Tuk, go.

Come on. Get out of here!

Go that way!

I'll draw
them off.

-Okay.
-Lo'ak, come.

Go, go, dive!

Now, dive!

Grab on.

Range 300.

Ready depth charges...

and fire, fire, fire.

No depth charges.

Scoresby,

Let's get this guy.

It's what we came here for.

Stay with him.

Heads on a swivel, guys.

Where are they?

The middle deck.

Where they launch the subs.

There's, like, a pool in the center.

They're at the forward railing.

No, no.
Stay here.

Talk to me, Corporal.

This ship's going down...

and your girls with it.

Your boy didn't have to die.

You brought that on yourself.

You thought you could keep
your family safe, but you can't.

Only one way to keep them safe.

So let's get this over with before

Not a step.

Cuffs on. Now.

You son of a bitch.

Please, don't hurt her.

Release.

Or I cut.

What, you think I

He's not mine.

We're not even the same species.

Just please don't...

Just please let her go.

-Don't.
-Please!

Don't kill him.

Listen to me!

In the ship.

Grab on.

Bro, I'm good. Go!

Okay.

Jake!

Dad.

Fuck!

Come on, you son of a bitch!

Dad, just breathe.

Neteyam?

No, Dad.
It's Lo'ak.

Oh, Lo'ak.

I'm sorry, sir.

I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

Just focus.

Focus on now.

We're losing the air pocket.

Come on.
We've gotta move.

Come on, Dad.

You know your way out?

I think so. But, Dad,
it's gonna be a long breath-hold.

I can't make it.

You can. You can.

No.

So you gotta go right now.

I can't lose you too, Dad.

Please.

Mama, I'm scared.

It is all right.

Stay close to me.

Stay close to Mama.

It's okay.

You just have to
slow your heart down.

Be real calm.

Breathe from here.

Hey, breathe from here.

The way of water has no...

beginning and no end.

The sea is around
you and in you.

The sea is your home...

before your birth
and after your death.

The sea gives
and the sea takes.

Water connects all things.

Life to death.

Darkness to light.

-Hi.
-Kiri!

Kiri.

Everything's going to
be all right, little sister.

Mom...

I'm gonna give this to you.

It'll help you.

Dad, you can do this.

Trust me.

Calm your heart.

Big breaths.

Last breath.

Follow me.

Hold on.

Just breathe.

Just breathe.

Thank you.

I See you...

son.

MaJake!

-Dad!
-Mom!

Dad. Dad.

Come on.

Here.

Brother.

Sullys stick together.

It was our greatest weakness...

and our great strength.

Thank you, Great Mother.

Thank you.

Let's move out.

Son.

Come with me.

Spider!

Monkey Boy!

Spider.

-You all right?
-Yeah.

Come here.

A son for a son.

Every songcord must have a last bead.

A father protects.

It's what gives him meaning.

The People say that
all energy is only borrowed.

And one day you
have to give it back.

Eywa holds...

all her children in her heart.

Nothing is ever lost.

Neteyam!

Neteyam!

My family and I...

we'll move on tomorrow.

Far away from here.

Your son lies with our ancestors.

You are Metkayina now.

And there it was.

We are Sea People now.

This is our home.

Dad!

Look what I caught!

Wow.

Oh, that's a big one.

He was in that pool.

By the rocks.

Right where you said.

What is it, Dad?

Why are you crying?

I'm just happy to see you, boy.

I'm happy to see you, too.

Here.

You try.

Okay.

Leave any for me?

Maybe.

Yeah! Check that out. See?

I see now.

I can't save my family by running.

This is our home.

This is our fortress.

This is where we make our stand.
