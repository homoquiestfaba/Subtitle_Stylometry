Hi, l'm yours, only yours
and only and only yours.

Vivan Shah.

And welcome to my show 'Dr. Love'.

Today, l'm going
to tell you a story.

This story is about,
Shanaya, Pooja and me.

This is a love triangle.

This love story also
tells you about my confusion.

The confusion will
only end with the story.

We're near the hospital.
A few more minutes.

Listen. Listen..

'lt was 2.14 in the afternoon# 

'Binaka Geetmala' had already wasted
14 seconds of the afternoon news# 

'Brothers and sisters,
the number one song.# 

'..on the music chart which
the entire nation is singing# 

''l'm not love.''

Have patience. We're almost there.

Two minutes.

''l'm not love.''

l'm stopping right here.

Please.

Wait, let me do something.

Don't worry. Wait.

l'm doing something.

Wait.

'This is All India Radio.

'News from Shikha Sarasvat# 

'Legendary hockey player Dhyanchand
just passed away in New Delhi# 

'He was 74 years old# 

Wait a moment.

Wait.

'Ms. Indira Gandhi
decided to contest from.# 

'..two constituencies
in the forthcoming..

'lt was me who born on that day# 

Thirty years ago.

ln the backseat of
a white Ambassador.

Model 1979.

'Today, l drive an
expensive car. Latest model# 

'l live in a plush mansion# 

'My voice has made me
popular if not my face# 

'Vivan, l come from a small town.# 

'..and l can't
adjust in the big city# 

'l iust feel like going back home# 

Pal, don't even think about it.

l also come from a small town.

All are your friends in
this big city.

You just need to
change your point of view.

You'll emerge as the
winner for sure.

'Hi, Vivan. My parents
are very interfering# 

'They question me about everything# 

'They don't understand me at all# 

'l hate my parents, pal# 

l can tell you a thing or
two about parents' love.

l lost my parents when l was 14.

Hey, Vivan, what's the
meaning of true love, man?

True love is all about
carrying it till the end.

Believe in love.

You must be thinking
that l'm so lucky.

But l'm not that lucky
because l'm getting divorced today.

The first chapter of my
complicated life had already begun.

The clock at the court struck 12.

My face was already looking gloomy.

l had lost my
confidence long before that..

..and it was clear
from my body language.

Pooja Talwar, have you got
anything to say about this divorce?

Your Honour, he is not so bad.

ln fact, he's a good friend,
but something is..

Our ego clashes are
getting worse and worse.

We start fighting over petty things.

l.. l think we're
better off as friends.

We can't think on the same level.

You? What about you?

To be frank, Your Honour.

lt's Pooja who wants divorce,
not me.

Divorce granted.

''Radio of the mind.''

''Let the radio play.''

The judge didn't bang his gavel
on the table, but on my heart.

And suddenly my mind
turned into a blaring radio..

..whose frequencies had
gone haywire.

l'd tune into a
station playing love songs..

..but all l could hear
was songs full of hatred.

After the songs,
jingles of negativity..

..and frustration would take over.

Ego hassles. Compatibility.

This relationship
terminology was too much to take..

..for my middle class upbringing.

Gradually, l forgot
how to spell confidence..

..and soon it became confusion.

''Radio.''

''Radio.''

Your spare keys.

This is my Lord Ganesha.

Let Him live in an AC
car worth Rs.2.5 million.

My Lord Ganesha doesn't
need your AC.

Anyway, no one's going to be with..

With me? What are you talking about?

Whatever. l don't want to
fight with you on this great day.

So, bye.

''Son-in-law.''

''Son-in-law has come to my place.''

''He's looking at
everything curiously.''

''Everyone loves son-in-law.''

''Son-in-law has come to my place.''

Divorce and
son-in-law are as different..

..as bitter-gourd and sugarcane.

Even the world's craziest
person would think twice..

..before becoming
someone's son-in-law..

..after getting divorced.

Because it doesn't take much
time for marriage to turn bitter.

But some people never even
gave me freedom to think about it.

My story is a bit weird.

As weird as this family
who is hell-bent..

..on making me their son-in-law.

Her mother is Parsi.

On a scale of ten for insanity,
l'll give her seven.

Her father is Punjabi.
l'll give him Nine.

And she is their
genetic cocktail. Shanaya.

lf l have my way, l'll
give her 100 out of 10.

And believe me, this
won't be enough for her.

lt's a long story which begins on
the night when Pooja divorced me.

And l was already two pegs down.

l met this crazy girl
when l reached my house.

I I
''Have hap.. happy
marriage anniversary.

''May good luck galore.''

''Chime down on your door.''

''Have hap.. happy anniversary.''

Do you know Pooia Talwar?

She has sent this.

Happy anniversary.

I I
''Have hap.. happy
marriage anniversary.

''May good luck galore.''

''Radio of the mind.''

''Let the radio play.''

''Forget the sadness, live
the life to the fullest.''

What insolence is this, baby?

lt is 12 in the night.

Who's being insolent? You or me?

You're sending me flowers and cards
for happy marriage anniversary..

..on the day we got divorced.

Give this to me.

Look here.
This has your name, right?

Give it to me.

Ouch.
Oh, l'm sorry.

Pricked by the thorn?

Wait, l'll go get band-aid.

l don't want your band-aid.
l don't want your flowers.

l don't want anything from you.

''Radio.''

Don't give yourself
too much importance.

l haven't sent these
flowers for you.

l have sent it for the Bhatnagars
who live on a floor below us.

And you.

Can't you guys deliver the
flowers at the right address?

l'm really sorry, ma'am. l had
reached the right address, but..

Right address? What's
written here? What is it?

6th floor. But where
did you go? 7th floor.

''Radio.''
l..

So, these flowers weren't for me?

No. These weren't for you.

Yes. l had sent a thorn though.

''Radio of the mind.''

Maybe you got that. Goodnight.

Listen, please don't cry. It's okay.

l don't want to keep anything
with me that belongs to her.

These tears. They belong to her.

Let them flow.

And you! You also get
the hell out of here.

'We had already finished
our share of arguments#

And, it's time now for
our next caller. Yes.

Hi Vivan, l'm really upset.

My boyfriend, you know..
l caught him red-handed.

He was checking out adult sites.

lt was better to relieve
myself of your sorrows.

But, l've changed my mind
about setting myself free.

So, Rahul would like
to say something to us.

Go ahead, Rahul.

My girlfriend is very suspicious.

She doesn't give me any space.

l was chatting with
a girl on Facebook.

She made such a big issue out of it.

So, Rahul why don't you
tell your girlfriend, that..

..she should start
chatting with a boy on Facebook.

This way, you'll get your space..

..and, she'll find a new friend.

What is Facebook?

'Shanaya was cool# 

'She would give me my space#

With him?
Sherif-Down.BlogSpot.CoM

What did you see in him?

l know he's so different.

But.. well, he's so simple,
you know.

Basic, and there's
this vulnerability.

There's something about him.

And, there's this strong chemistry.

And, l just.. l don't know,
l just can't control it.

lt iust happened. It happened.

You know, it happens when..

Why are you always on the Facebook?

Because, l'm cool and l'm hip.

Hey, shall l open
an account for you? - No.

You'll find girls
there to flirt around with.

l don't want it.

l'm very happy being single,
and l'm very serious.

Does he know that you love him?
He does know.

Every guy can sense it.

But, he's too scared
because of his past experiences.

l mean, he's just so
scared of relationships.

You're iust so scared.

Scared of relationships.
Yes, l am.

He will never accept..

..that he can fall in
Iove with anyone else again.

But, one day he will say.

Seem lost, seem found.
Seem defeated.

Seem distressed. Seem happy.
l feel forlorn.

l can't forsake you?

But, l can't live without you.

l can't forget you ever.

'l must say, l was
settling down in life again# 

'Thanks to my friend, Shanaya# 

'Every radio show has
its highs and lows# 

'When, my rating of my
show started falling..

..she encouraged me# 

'She said, on the show
l sound like someone..

..who doesn't have
anymore romance in his life# 

'And, when l decided..

..that, l will introduce a
fake love story on my show#

Sweet and salty. 50-50, you know.

Slowly, our ratings increased.

Just like our friendship.

Bye.
Bye.

You're lying.

You are Shanaya's boyfriend.

Why would l lie to

Because you're scared of me.

Then, you can think

l want to hear you say it.

But, l'm not your
daughter's boyfriend.

Shanaya.

Fine. If you aren't
Shanaya's boyfriend, then..

..it shouldn't make a
difference to you, because..

..starting from tomorrow
Shanaya is under house-arrest.

You're a fool, Vivan.

They are not getting
you married to her.

Say that you're her boyfriend.

Look, there's no clause about
doing social-service in my contract.

This isn't my problem.

Hey, shut up. You, shut up.

l'll call you back, Pooia.

No, no don't fool
around with me, man.

Do you know, this show is
worth 80 million a week?

That's 320 million a month.

l'm doomed, man.

And, if l am.. you all are.

Should l toss a coin?

No, l mean if you're confused..

..then, lets toss a coin and decide.

Decisions of love are not
made by tossing coins, sir.

l mean.. Daddy.

Wow.

What a dialogue, my man.

Radio people earn by
speaking such dialogues.

At least now l know, my daughter..

..won't starve with you.

You've made me so happy.

Do you have a backache?

No, l mean if it isn't too much
of a trouble in bending down..

..you can take daddy's blessings.

That's the best way to
win over Shanaya's mummy.

You've made me so happy.

You've made me so happy.

'And, this way to save
80 million of my channel..

..l became this
family's official son-in-law# 

Son-in-law has arrived home.

Son-in-law is dear to all.

At times l think..

The first week.

Who's this mystery girl?

The second week.

We run a campaign all over the city.

And the fourth week..

Shanaya becomes a celebrity.

What if Shanaya's identity
is revealed? What will she do?

What? Shanaya will be a celebrity.

She's as popular as you.

We are playing a charade.

But who'll believe
that it's just a charade?

Who'll marry her?
Oh, come on.

Which era is he talking about?

Vivan, do you have any idea?

These days, men queue up
to marry a celebrity girl.

We we will get her married.

Have you rehearsed all the lines?
Yes.

Okay, l got have to go.
But just take care of these..

Hi.
Thank you.

Hi. - l've heard you've
become a big star?

Are you happy, or..

Shanaya, you aren't my competition.
Please.

Can you hear me? Okay. Done.

Do you see, at the back there?

They are wolves.

They iust worship one thing. Money.

They'll make you dance
to their tunes.

Anywhere they want to.

You'll feel as if
you've conquered the world.

Then they'll abandon you.

You won't have any
inkling what has hit you.

May l straighten your collar?
We aren't on TV, okay?

Do you understand what l am saying?

What? - l made no mistake
understanding you.

Okay, everybody. The
countdown begins now.

This is 98.3FM Radio Mirchi.
It's hot.

And l'm yours and only
yours Vivan. Vivan Shah.

And l'm Shanaya Dhingra.

'Gradually, our stupid
fake show had become a craze# 

Romance, chemistry, compatibility.

l'm better off being single.

'Mumbai, Delhi, Baengaluru# 

'As if the entire country was
party to our fake love story# 

Vivan, what's your
relationship status?

lt's complicated.

'And not only has this show
broken the radio records.# 

'..but it's on the verge
of making a new record.# 

'..which nobody had
even thought about# 

'A radio show would be telecasted.# 

'..live on the
television for the first time.

'Yes, for the very first time# 

'There was nothing
great about the show# 

'But still, people
were lovingloved it# 

'The radio show.# 

Finally, finally,
something's happening.

Way to go.
Yes.

Shanaya says, ''Thank God.''

''lf l hadn't called
you up on the show..''

''..we would never have met.''

You know..
This is more..

And Vivan says..
How's it going, guys?

All set?
All set. Perfect. Great.

And Vivan says..

''My life would have been
incomplete if we hadn't met.''

''l love you, Shanaya.''

That would be an
acceptance of my love towards her.

Bingo! You got it, my boy!

We get paid 80
million precisely for that.

l want no such lines.
l don't love her.

l won't say any such
thing on the television.

Vivan, listen. Come back.
Listen to me!

Vivan!

Vivan, who's the mystery girl?

Will there be a 'Swayamvar'
(groom choosing ceremony) today?

l hope she isn't your
ex-wife wearing the mask, Vivan.

Do you love her, Vivan?

Everyone says it's a staged show.

What do you say, Vivan?

''l felt really happy meeting you.'''

'lt's a pleasure knowing you# 

Pooia, what's wrong?

Hey, what happened?

Come on, Pooja.
You're a strong girl.

better than Vivan one day.

l don't want someone
better than Vivan.

l want Vivan.

Priya, l ruined everything.

l really messed it up.

No, dear.

Why isn't he speaking?

Should l prompt him?
No. He'll do it.

Okay.

Vivan, l know you can hear me.

Speak your lines, Vivan.

Say your lines.

'Can you hear me, Vivan?'

'l'll say the lines if

'You can follow me, okay?'

'Do you hear me?'

Yes!

Uncle, Aunt, come quickly!

What happened? Why are you shouting?

What happened? Why are you shouting?
Look. - What's this..

Why is she crying?

Can't even identify
tears of happiness, can you?

'Vivan, please. Come on# 

'This show will be a flop# 

Please, please. Speak up!

l can't say these lines, Shanaya.

l've lost the one l loved.

Now, l feel nothing for anyone.

l can't recite these
lines even for the show.

l'm sorry for putting you in a soup.

Shanaya, darling.
Recite the lines, baby.

Come on. Say that you love him.

'Say you love him# 

Say it. Come on. Come on,

She's a star. She's a star.

What's happening? Tell us.

Please, tell us something.

Answer our questions, sir.

'The 80 million game was over# 

'But the mirror this
game showed us was opaque# 

'The next day, Shanaya
invited Pooja and me.# 

'..to a restaurant to
celebrate the success of the show# 

'Pooia didn't want to go# 

'But Shanaya was adamant# 

Which other shows do you like?

All those that are aired on

Keep listening to the show. - Yes.

Yes, stay tuned.

Vivan, come sit here.
Why?

Stupid, your clothes

match with that woman's.

Should l go sit there?
No. Here.

Okay, okay.
Just come here.

Okay. Yes. Fine.

Shall we order
if you both are done..

..with this radio show of yours?

Okay. So, tell me Pooia.

What do you miss the most..

..that you had with Vivan
earlier and it's lacking now?

The tiffs.
What? Really?

What are you doing to my purse?

Tiffs? How about one now?

What are you getting me into?

She's a very dangerous girl.

How about a good
sumptuous tiff, Pooja?

l want to see it. Come on.

lt'll prove costly.
Doesn't matter.

Hey..

'Like always, Pooja displayed
her unpredictable behaviour# 

What are you doing?

l would break the crockery
when we would fightfought.

This way!
Pooja..

'But what surprised me was that.# 

'..Shanaya me and l
Shanaya were absolutely..

..out of character that night# 

That's what l am
asking her?. What's wrong?

'We were behaving like kids# 

Bring some more. l'll pay.

lt's fun to break plates.

Eat some, break some.

Yes! - It goes for you all too.
Come on!

Break as many plates as you wish.

l'll foot the damages.

But sir.. - 'l'd heard in my
childhood that breakingage of..

..a glass brings good luck# 

Keep breaking them.

''Lovely! Just do it.''
What are you doing?

Keep at it. Break them.

lt's fun to break plates.

Keep at it.
Don't break the plates.

Very good. Keep at it. Break
some more. Break some more.

Life is beautiful.

Oh, wow. Hang on. Hang on.

l've to make a good happy
announcement to you all.

Friends, the first
song of Shanaya and your..

..album is about to be recorded.

''Whenever you smiled..

..l felt..

''..that there's a purpose to life.''

''Yes, there's a purpose to life.''

''Why does the heart
harbour sadness?''

''lt loves unconditionally,
but suffers each moment.''

''Yes, the wretched one
thing doesn't accept..''

Sleeping?
It's 3am, Pooja.

Oops. l completely forgot that.

You dream about good things at 3am.

Who are you dreaming about?

Are you drunk?
No. l'm not drunk. l'm not drunk.

l'm not drunk.

You know, Vivan, l went to a party.

Everyone was talking about you.

About how successful your show is.

About how good the chemistry
between Shanaya and you is.

Everybody was saying you
guys are good together.

Like a couple. Nice couple.

Pooja, we will talk tomorrow morning.
Tell me one thing.

You say that you are like friends.

Are you like 'just buddies' or
'''physically intimate buddies?'''

Hi!
Vivan.

l'm really sorry.

Whatever happened last night..

lt's ok, Pooia.

l.. l.. l don't know
what l was saying..

lt's.. l..

l didn't mean it that way.

You have said sorry.
It's okay with me.

But yes, don't talk about
all this in front of Shanaya.

The situation will
become very awkward.

l was drunk last night, Vivan.

l promise it'll never happen again.
Cool.

Brother-in-law, it's gone.

ls it coming?

Oh! It's gone again.

Brother-in-law, it's gone again.

Son-in-law. - Is it coming?
Is it coming, papa?

lt comes, it goes.. Can't you see?

Will you say it from
here or will you go there..

..and ask him to turn it a bit?

ls it coming? - Brother-in-law,
it's better. Turn it a bit more.

Papa.
Now? - Now? Papa.

Papa. Papa. You are
giving me a headache.

We are getting Pakistani channels,
but not ours.

What a transistor!
Papa, it's not my job.

This is not my iob. l am an RJ.

l'm not a dish antenna mechanic.

l am trying.
Leave the plate..

..hold the spoon. Hold the spoon.

Explain it to him.
That tall stand, brother-in-law.

That one.
What tall stand!

Forget it!

Yes, brother-in-law. One
more try. Please one more try.

Brother-in-law, for me.
One last try. Please.

Papa, give me one.

You gave me just one.
If you eat all the peas..

..what will we make curry with?

Here. It's done?

What done! We need to peel them all.

When we cook them they
will become this small..

Have meals with us.
She cooks very well.

And for you l won't
even use chilies today.

Yes. -Vivan has a
meeting in a music company.

People say.. Your
daughter has become a star.

And l reply.. Not iust my daughter..

..but our would-be
son-in-law is a superstar.

Why are annoying him, father?

Look, the women of this
house have got one big problem.

They won't let others talk.

You don't worry, papa.
You are a policeman.

We will get even with
the women of this house.

We will definitely..

What happened?
Tell me what happened.

Dad, a caterpillar.

Finally someone's able to scare you.

Papa, was there a lion in the pea?

'So that was this Parsi-Punjabi
family's matinee show# 

'Night show won't be so much fun.# 

'..as DCP sir would be on duty# 

'lt's not as much fun if even
one crazy member's missing# 

l shouldn't be telling
you my family secrets.

What if my father
had got a heart attack!

And where did this
meeting crop up from?

Vivan, we shall stop this game now.

Why? l am enioying it.

But it's your life.

lf we play more the
hurt will be more, right?

On 24th the video will be shot.

Shall we make Pooia choreograph it?

Yes, she's very good.

Ok, shall we go to dinner
tomorrow night, the three of us?

There we will discuss
how to shoot this song.

Ok, done.

She's a strange girl.

l don't care if she doesn't come.

Pooja, let's order. l'm very hungry.
Excuse me! - Yes, sir.

Please send someone.
Sure, sir.

She's not coming.
Why?

Don't know.

Maybe she told her family about it.
What?

That all this between her and me..
That all this was a game.

Excuse me, ma'am! May l help you?

What would you have?
Anything.

One.. - 'l was very upset.
But my defense mechanism.# 

'..was making me do the opposite
of what l was supposed to do# 

'l was upset, but yet l was
yet trying to crack a joke# 

Anything else?
Just get that.

Ok, ma'am.
Thanks. - You are welcome.

So? - l can't believe you
just said that. - l say.

Vivan, l miss your sense of humor.

'ln spite of being together
for six years we weren't close# 

'Today we are not together,
but we are sitting close here# 

''l want someone..''

''l want someone..''

'' as my companion for life.''

''l want someone..''

''l have been alone for too long.''

''l am stopped with tiredness.''

''My loneliness is saying..
l want someone.''

'A lot happened
during this video shoot# 

'Shanaya found some new excuses.# 

'..for not taking me to her home# 

'Pooia and l became friends again# 

'And Shayana made
Pooja's home her new address# 

O God! It's so hot.
'She tried everything possible.# 

'..to come close to Pooia# 

Wow!

Such a nice house.

Yes, there are some
benefits of divorce.

Or else this house
wouldn't have been so clean.

l'm gonna tell Vivan.

Ok, where is the mirror?
There. Inside.

lnside?
Left. - Wow! l love your house.

l like this, but isn't it
one size too big? - l told you.

l don't know. l like the
color though. - Hey, coffee.?

Yes, please. Shall l make it?
Ok, make it.

Nice.

Thank you.

Coffee.

''lt was better if l had
got rid of your pain.''

''But l didn't change
only the views changed.''

Vivan has changed so much.

Negative? Positive?
Oh definitely positive. Positive.

Earlier when he used to talk it
was as if he was spitting venom.

Then marryiage him again.

lt will be great fun.

Go and make coffee. Go. Go.

''Can't twist and turn.''

''l can't forget you.''

What happened?

Peps, l was thinking..
What were you thinking?

That why don't you
ever behave like a man?

Why? What's wrong with me?

Have l ever asked you
to behave like a girl?

Vivan.

This is the 12th round that we
can hear from this building.

And in reply the
policemen have also fired.

Let me tell you one more
time that you are watching..

..the exclusive pictures of
a live shootout only on TV81 .

Up or down?.. Tell Palekar..
Right now we don't know..

..if they are normal ordinary
gangsters or dangerous terrorists.

But whoever they are they
have got lots of explosives..

Firing's going on from both sides.

Close the door.

We shall go a bit closer
and see what's going on.

See her. See her.
Sir, this TV girl will die today.

Patil. Patil. Stop her.

lf she gets so close she
will get a bullet. Stop her.

And as you can see..
Hey! Come back.

Come back. Do Yyou
want to die? Come back.

All of them want breaking news.

They will get breaking news once
they break their necks breaks.

So.. Have we made some mistake?

Have we made some mistake?
No.

ls the food bad at our home?
No.

What?
l mean it's good.

We have been barred
from going inside.

Our exclusive coverage..
So our superstar son-in-law..

..has become so busy
that he doesn't come..

..even when we call him.
..you mustn't have seen..

..a police encounter from so close.

He's gone. Patil. Patil. Patil.

Didn't Shanaya didn't tell
you anything? - Patil, come in.

Patil, come in. Come in, Patil.

Pa..

Oh! It's been two hours.

They have just gone overboard.
Come on.

Sir, who are they?
Move aside.

Sir,
Move. - Sir. Please, sir. Sir.

PCP..
Shanaya.

She is in the show, Vivan.
Hi, Peps.

Please get me to talk to Shanaya.

Play any song.
Cross-firing is going on.

lt's my life and death.
Song break is five minutes away.

But buddy, you sound like
you are in love with her.

See this. One more gangster is shot.

Love? No. - Accept it if you
want to or else don't accept it.

You are my shrink.
You know everything.

Will you let me talk to her now or..
Ok, fine. Relax.

l'll put your call through.

But don't tell your name.
l'll lose my job.

Firing has resumed begun again..
Hello, you have reached 98.3 FM.

l am Shanaya. What shall l call you?

You can call me anything.
l have a problem.

Look, l know a girl
and her family thinks..

..l am their would-be son-in-law.

But the truth is that
there is nothing of that sort..

..between that girl and me.

Hello! Hello!

Yes. Yes. - So that girl said
that she will talk to her family.

But she didn't. Why must
would she have done such a thing?

May be that girl got a bit scared.
Got scared?

But l want to tell her not
to get scared. l am with her.

Thank you.

l mean thank you on
that girl's behalf.

And today l am going to her house.

Why should that girl alone be
stuck in this problem alone?

You shouldn't go there.
l will go there.

You are making a very big mistake.

That's wrong pronunciation.
And l am not making a mistake.

l will go there. Thanks
for talking to me. Bye.

Hello! Hello!
Take him away.

We are preparing 'Kadi'
(a curry) at home today.

Will you come?
Take him inside. Take him inside.

He ruined my shirt.

Take him along. He is.. - l will
definitely come. - Pick him up.

And tell mummy that she
can use as many as chilies..

..as she wishes to.

l am not scared of chilies.

Come on,
brother-in-law. You can do it.

Come on, boy.

Come on.
Finish it, son. - Come on, buddy.

Where are you going, Soni?

lf your Vivan cries,
will we wipe his tears?

Water?
Great, you transistor.

Take.
No water. Take it away.

'l took a firm decision, but
still l couldn't gather courage.# 

'..to tell Shanaya's
family about it# 

Shanaya, with your family l feel
like l got a family, you know..

What is a family? l never knew that.

Listen..

Whomever you will marry, tell
them that he will get only you.

Your family is already booked.

Pooia, do you like this?

Nice, but l think it will
merge with other colors.

Try this one.

This looks nice.

Shanaya, let's make
a deal. Your family..

Pooja, isn't this a bit tight here?
Just give it a try.

No, l want to go
find something else.

Let's go find something please.
Ok, then.

Ok..
l got it.

A great idea for the
Iast song of the new album.

A family which warmth, love..

A family that l never had.
How is it?

Rotten.

Why? - We are targeting youth,
not the old.

But..
No. - Just one song..

No. No. No.

You know what, actually..

Enough. l am tired. l
don't want to do another album.

After this one, no more please.

You will get another
back-up vocalist.

Shanaya.

You're the one who said
life is beautiful. And now..

Yes.

Of course, life is beautiful. Sure.

And you know what, l am very hungry.

l am hungry.

l'm hungry.

Superstar? Superstar, Vivan?
Give me.

This guy washes the
dishes very well.

Not very well, but nicely.

This guy washes the dishes nicely.

Should we hire him
to wash the dishes?

l had one for five years.
Today's day.

Do you still remember it?
Of course.

Mumbai was flooding.

Shanaya, do you know..
Pooja and l had reached..

..and the clerk of
the court was missing.

Do you remember, the judge
himself typed the papers?

There were so many
spelling mistakes.

Yes, man. Shanaya,
can you believe it..

The judge missed out ARR
from the word 'Marriage# 

He made Mirage out of word Marriage.

No.. don't do that. No!
Don't do that!

Naughty.

Marriage has really become mirage.

l lost it and couldn't find it.

Today is your
marriage anniversary, right?

lt is a good omen.
Yeah.

Break one more.
Hey, you guys.. enough. What?

Jhandulal Tyagi.

Hello? - Yes, madam.
Is this airplane booking?

Yes.
Tell me one thing.

There's a place named
Kasauli beyond Delhi. - Yes.

Where do you stay?
l? Mumbai.

Mumbai is a very big city. Isn't it?
Yes.

lt is a very big city.
Yes, it is.

Does the whole area lie
in your district? - What?

Since how many years
do you stay here?

l was born here.
Why?

Sorry? - l mean there must
be some hill stations around?

Panchagani is a hill station.

l am asking you about Kasauli and
you're talking about Panchagani.

Sir, but you asked me
whether there were some..

Yes, so how much money does
one need to go to Kasauli?

Sir, no flight goes to Kasauli.

Okay, how much money does
one need to return from there?

Sir, when the flight doesn't
go there, how would it return?

l am asking you the same question.

lt is your job to book a ticket.
It is not my job.

Sir, one minute. l'll
check and let you know.

How can l give you
cheque from the phone now?

No.. l'll find it out for you, sir.
Fine? Why fine me?

What wrong have l done, madam?

Sir, l'll search for you
and tell you. - Search.

ls it a ladies scientist?
What? Idiot.

Jhandulal Tyagi.

There's lot of confusion.

So friends, that was Jhandulal
Tyagi for all of you and now..

..let's move on to the contest.

The question of today's contest is..

Why can't we deal with
our personal life and..

..professional life differently?

'The show timings for
Shanaya and me are different..

..but we always try to
have lunch together# 

'Today, l couldn't find her# 

'When l asked the office guys,
they told me that..

..Shanaya was on the terrace# 

'When l reached there,
l saw Shanaya crying# 

'She saw me and was
about to leave from there# 

'When l asked the reason of her
crying to the marketing guys..

..they said Shanaya
was a 'Selfish woman# 

'And that was it. l lost my cool# 

Can't forget it. l can't stay
with you. l can't forget you.

Sometimes close and sometimes apart.

l am like a loser.

Sometimes cheerful
and sometimes sad.

l am iust roaming about.

Beloved, you mean the world to me.

Shanaya wants to quit the show.

But she is a star RJ now.
How can we just let her go?

'Negotiation, bribe, ,punishment,
spying.

You know what l mean? She cannot go.

And those guys. They were
just doing their job, Vivan.

You misunderstood them.

Shanaya wasn't crying
because somebody said..

..something to her, but
because she used to think..

..we were one big family. We
are a family and Shanaya..

..was leaving us.

Do you understand? Don't worry,
Vivan. We'll not let her go.

Whether she leaves or not..
l don't care about it.

You love her, man.

Whether you care for her
or not. You love her, Vivan.

To hell with you.
Hey, come on, Vivan!

Hi, l am yours and
only yours.. Vivan Shah!

What's love? Love is..
What happened to me.

But whatever is in my heart,
l can't say it. Why?

Because my past experience
doesn't go out of my mind.

So.. this is my denial mode.

Vivan Shah's denial mode.

Beloved. Beloved.

Beloved. Beloved.

l am surviving by your name.

l request you to keep loving me.

Beloved. Beloved.

Beloved. Beloved.

l am surviving by your name.

Those flowers.. l want
some more here. Okay? - Okay.

You go and check those costumes.
Yeah? - Yeah.

What about this bench? -We'll
have to move that from here.

Where's Shanaya?
She left.

'Shanaya was behaving
like a complete stranger# 

'Deliberately she
was fighting with me# 

'She was provoking me# 

'She was provoking me by
fighting with me unnecessarily# 

'l didn't understand
this at that time# 

'Shanaya said that when the
game of rupees 800 million.# 

'..then the game of being
his fake boyfriend should end# 

l started this game. l
have the guts to end it too.

l'll tell you when to do that.

No matter how much l
Iove you it feels less.

That's the reason it
grows more every moment.

l believe in life because of you.

l request you not to break my trust.

Beloved. Beloved.

Beloved. Beloved.

Beloved. Beloved.

Vivan, l was wrong.

You sing very well.

Beloved. Beloved.

Hi, this is 98.3 FM radio..

'Shanaya refused to
do any show with me# 

'Her own show slowly
became very popular# 

'One day, she stopped
doing her show# 

Vivan, mama is coming
home in the evening.

Okay, l'll be there.
Tell her everything today. - Sure.

Thanks for everything.
Ok.

No, l can't do anything. Please.

Till when? This is unprofessional.

l will not agree to this thing.

This is not my job, and..
Ma'am..

Have a look at this, ma'am.

Don't talk to me about
this again and again.

Yes, show this to me.
Okay, ma'am.

Just understand.

Look, l don't want to interfere
in somebody's personal life.

lt is not in my hands. Do whatever
you feel like.. or fire me.

Show that to me.

Madam, we call this as
'Karva Chauth' light.

lf the moon doesn't appear,
you can see this and..

l'll take this.
Madam, this is a very cheap light.

l can show a nice light to
you according to your standard.

'This light was not
worth for Pooja# 

'But Pooja was changing# 
l want this.

Look, will you call me
hundred times! Are you nuts?

l don't have any
answer for your questions.

Now, come on.. you all
have taken me for granted.

l can't do anything. That's it! l'll
not answer your calls now. Okay?

Whose call was it?
Actually.. Shanaya's matter..

The people from the radio
station called me because..

..of this problem..
they are pressurizing me.

Because Shanaya is
going to sign off today.

She doesn't want to do her show.

What can l do?

What happened?

Shanaya wants me to tell
the truth to her parents.

What's the truth? - The drama
that l did with her family members..

..by involving Shanaya in the show.

You like her family?
Yes. They are nice people.

And Shanaya? - Poor girl,
unnecessarily l pushed her into this.

Okay fine. We'll have
a cup coffee and leave.

..a girl's family very well.

l have to go with you, okay?

Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

Sometimes it makes you
happy and sometimes sad.

lt makes you sentimental
sometimes and sometimes mad.

Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

Vivan! Cockroach!
Hey, throw it!

Vivan, l'll kill you! You've
many cockroaches in your car.

Hello, you've reached
98.3 FM and l am Shanaya.

We have our next caller.
Yes, please.

Hi.
Hi.

Shanaya, l am Harsh. l am
going through some serious..

..emotional problem.

Okay. If these are the symptoms,
what are you suffering from?

l am confused. Am l in love?

Either you fall in love or
you don't. Why get confused?

We are close to God.
We are innocent.

Then what is the problem?

Rakesh, what's love? - To tell you
the truth.. l myself don't know.

Should we fall in love or not?
Please, go ahead.

lf the other person
doesn't love you, then?

Then love your neighbor.

lf not the neighbor, love
the one who's behind you.

There must be someone for sure.

ls it so simple to
forget your first love?

lf it is not easy,
then make it easy.

lf you want to cry, hide your tears.

Smile.. because the one you love..
think about him too.

Even he would be in
Iove with someone else.

lf you don't move away
from his eyes..

..it means that your
Iove is not true.

lf it doesn't work this way..
eat Kurkure (snacks)

Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

l want to go.
What?

l want to go. l want to eat Kurkure.
What?

Kurkure?
Yes. Because if l don't move..

..you wont be able to see.

Think love as a battlefield.
It is a game of wrestling.

This is wrestling of the heart.

The heart which loses
wins this. This is love.

This love is fun.

When l took Him from here,
wherever l kept it..

..it didn't look good.

Everyone has their own choice.

His place is here. Your
place is somewhere else.

Pooia, don't talk in riddles?

Those puzzles which you
don't want to solve at all.

Because you're an
idiot and l haven't come..

..across an idiot like
you in my whole life.

Okay.. will you answer
one simple question?

Do you love me? Now?

Life is like a radio. It makes
you listen to different tunes.

Hit this ball if you can.
Here, l hit it.

This is a broken ball.
You talk rubbish.

Your ball is not good.
l want to do bat ting now.

Let's play again.
No, not out. - Out! Out!

No.. l don't think l am out.
l am falling.

Play with me.
l fell because of you.

Come on, there..
That side.

Enough. l'll do the batting now.

lt looks good.

lt's come.
It's come!

Enough! Enough!
Its come!

Enough! Enough!

Enough! Enough! Same! Same!

Hey, are you out of your mind!
Do it again! - Do it again!

Start it again!

Yes! It went off again!
It went off again!

Go and tell him to do it properly!

Brother-in-law! - Bloody,
what's this? (Saale, ye kya hai?

Has it come?
No, brother-in-law.

Do it properly.
Vivan, didn't you tell them?

No. Has it come?
No, brother-in-law.

Please, Vivan. You're
not trying to understand.

They've called the priest. Please!

Stop this game now.

Has it come?
No, brother-in-law.

Priest? Evening? The priest
had come, and he left. - What?

lt will be on the second.
After three months.

l told them,
l can't wait so muchlong.

l've been shouting
forom souch a long time.

Son-in-law, you're too much.
You spoke like a transistor.

You showed me all the
channels of the world, except India.

Papa, l am trying to. l am
not a dish antenna mechanic.

l am an RJ. - RJ or DJ,
you couldn't repair my TV.

Vivan please. Stop all this now.

Enough is enough.

You don't know what
and when to speak.

'My confusion was over# 

'The damage that was caused by
judge's hammer had resolved# 

'l was standing on father-in-law's
slippery ladder steps# 

'Shanaya was standing
in front of me# 

'l had a song on my lips# 

''l fell in love with
you at the first sight.''

''Shanaya, l was lost in myself.''

''lt was love, but wasn't love.
l was in my denial mode.''

''l was angry with life.
It was since years.''

''l was in love,
but didn't reveal it.''

''l was happy, but l made you cry.''

''So, l tell you.. my beloved.
Yes, l love you.''

''l shiver from only one problem.''

''Change this dish
antenna of your father's.''

What happened?
Why are you crying now?

They are tears of happiness.

You didn't propose to me till now.

l did iust now, on the ladder.

l want you to say it
properly say, l love you.

l love you.
Thank you.

You told said it very soon.
Not very soon.

Can l ask you a serious question?
Yes.

Why did you take so much time?

How could l hav've said that?
l wanted to come to you..

..without any baggage.

Shanaya, there are some
relationships, which don't..

..end even after they are broken.

A relationship needs
closure even after it has ended.

When Pooia divorced me..

our relationship
didn't finish completely.

There was something left,
which has ended completely today.

When Pooja asked me, 'Do
you love me?' and then..

..she asked me, now.. l
didn't have any answer.

lt is true that when Pooja
divorced me and then came into..

..my life again, then our
relationship became more complicated.

l was confused, very confused.

l knew that l was in love with you,
but was scared to tell you.

l didn't have the guts
to get wounded hurt again.

Now do you have the guts?
l love you.

Never leave me.
Never. Never.

Hello?
Vivan..

Jhandu, l am in a meeting now.

You upload your photo
on the facebook.

ln status you write..
in a relationship.

Jhandu, it is me, pal.

When will you go on a honeymoon?
Jhandu!

When will you be back
from honeymoon? - Jhandu!

Who will cook the food?
Jhandu!

Who will wash the clothes?
Jhandu!

Who'll sweep the floor?
Jhandu!

Who'll give birth to children?
l hope it not on air?

Who'll drop them to the school?

There's a lot of confusion.
Too much.
