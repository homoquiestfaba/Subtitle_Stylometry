#NOWHERE TO HIDE#

EMT security. We are reading
a security breach in the

southeast corner of your building.
Please evacuate immediately.

Kimmy. - Possible intruder alert.
The police are on their way.

Mom… - We have to get out.
What's going on? - Now.

Let's go.

Sarah! Kimmy!

You're calling dad?

That was weird.

Sarah! Kimmy!

Sarah!

Eddie? - Mrs. Crane, EMT security.
Unfortunately,it was a false alarm.

The police have been called off and...
What?

We offer our sincerest
apologies and we'll do our best

to make sure it never happens again. - You
have any idea what we just went through?

I understand and I can credit
your account for one free month.

Well, gee, that would be great, thanks.

Dad's new super duper
security system's tons of fun.

Can we do this again tomorrow night?

Hey, you there?

Hey!

Yeah, hon, Can you call
me when you get this?

Kimmy and I just had a fun little
drama. And when you coming home?

We've been getting a
little worried about you.

All right, love you.

So, where's dad? - You know how
he gets when he's working a case.

He should be back soon.

Who's “Studboy 69”?

Mom.
Sounds like a classy guy.

He's just a friend.

Yeah, that's how they get you.
Oh, is that how dad got you?

Yeah. He was a little more
romantic. Not much but a little.

Do you ever take that thing off?

If it's too loud, you're too old.

All right, no more
I.M.ing tonight, okay?

Gotcha. No more randomly
storming out of the house, okay?

Gotcha. Oh, and this?

Doesn't keep out as much
light as you think it does.

Hey, it took you four hours
to catch me, detective.

Ooh, and you're not as
clever as you think you are.

Cops retire. Moms don't. Love you.

You better.

No more texting.

Okay, we'll do this your
way, But if you hurt them...

It will be because
you chose to hurt them.

What the hell are you up to, Ed?

All right, take him to the warehouse. Wh...
where'd they go? Go out and find them.

Shoot them if you must. Keep going, Keep
going. Throw it over the roof. There you go!

Somebody got a bazooka!

What did you do with them, you
son of a bitch? Where are they?

Who?
Somebody just busted down the door

across the street. The guy's got a gun.
What's the address, sir?

It's 3411 Marine
drive. You better hurry.

Where are they? - I don't know. -
Tell me where they are! - I don't know!

Drop the gun, Eddie! - I can't.
Drop it! - You don't understand.

I don't care! Drop the gun!
You don't understand.

This guy's got my family. He
said he's gonna kill my family

with a push of his finger. - Family?
I've never seen you Before in my life.

Hey don’t touch that! Where are they?
Hey, hey, Eddie! Eddie, it's me, Jack.

Okay, just calm down. If
this guy is who you think

he is we'll bring him in
together, all right? - No.

Okay, look. Does he look like he's
in any position to hurt anyone?

Okay.

Team leader, we got 'em.
You want us to take 'em out

No!

Hello.
Hello? Eddie?

No. Sarah?

Who is this?
Sarah, it's Jack.

Mom!

Mom!

Mom?

How you holding up, hon?
I'm okay.

Look, I know no matter what I
say, it isn't gonna be enough,

but you gotta know that I'm always
gonna be here for you and Kimmy.

Okay? Now, look, if
there's anything I can do,

Anything, you've gotta promise
me that you'll call me, all right?

Anything and anytime.
At home or the precinct.

Come here. Come here, you.

Hello, Sarah.
What are you doing here?

I... I usually don't deliver
these things personally,

But I wanted to bring them myself.

Two months I've been asking for
my husband's things. Two months.

And then they send you to bring them?
I volunteered.

They don't release these things
until after the investigation.

It's protocol. You remember.

Protocol? So you're here
to tell me about protocol.

There was something happening with him,

And I.A. may want to put this
whole thing to rest, but I can’t.

Eddie wasn't a bad cop.
You of all people know that.

I know what kind of man Ed was,
Sarah, But you should've seen the

look in his eye that night. There
was something going on with him.

I hope that that brings
some kind of closure.

Jack this isn't a gift from
you. This is my property.

And right now, honestly, in
this moment, there is nothing

that you can say that will
make any of this any better.

Hey, who was at the door?
No one.

What's that?

Okay, fine.

Let's start over, sweetheart.

How are you doing?

I'm okay, But what about you? You
gonna leave the house at all today?

You gonna tomorrow? Maybe the next day?

Maybe you should get out. I don't know.

You can't stay in the house forever.
You're becoming kind of a shut in.

No, I've just been...

Been under self imposed house
arrest for the past two months?

Seriously,people go nuts staying
cooped up inside too long.

And you were never really that
together in the first place.

Just promise me you won't get a million
cats and become the town cat lady.

Okay. I promise.

Maybe you could go to the store.
We sure could use some groceries.

Yeah.

Sunlight's not gonna
turn you to dust, Sarah.

Mom. I'm your mom.

#U THERE?
ANY BETTER TODAY?#

#STARTING TO FEEL INVISIBLE HERE.
COME MEET ME. I'LL CHEER U UP#

Roadlink. I see you're
having some car troubles.

Yeah, it just sort of...
Stopped?

Yeah, you guys are good. - Plus your entire
car is on our grid. Looking at my screen here,

I'm seeing that there's some
trouble with the engine itself.

Looks like it's maybe the
fuel injector valve cover.

It could've just popped off. If you
wanna take a look under the hood,

it's just this little seal that you can
screw back on with a twist of your fingers.

How far away's that gas station?
Around two miles.

Here,I'll pop the hood for you.

How'd that go?
We'll see.

You're amazing.

Come back for the 9.30 show. Is there
anything I can do for you, Ms. Crane?

Mrs.
Oh, all apologies.

Is there anything else I
can do for you, Mrs.Crane?

Can you carry groceries? - Have a
good day, Mrs. Crane. - Thank you.

Hello? Kimmy?

A little help here.

Got more groceries In the car.

Kimmy?

All right, If you see her, Just
have her call home, okay? Thanks.

Voicemail. Figure it out, genius.

If you didn't get my 20 other messages...
Message box is full. Please try again later.

Roadlink, How may I help you?
Oh, I'm sorry.

I must've hit the button by mistake.
No worries, Ms. Crane.

I see you've recently
filled up and added oil.

You won't need me if you keep doing that...
Mrs. Crane.

And I'm sorry I hit the button by mistake.
I don't need any help but thank you.

That's okay because you don't
really need to hit the button.

We can hear you at all
times. The button's just sort

of for client piece of mind.
It's something they don't tell you

in the brochure. - How do
I turn it off? - You don't.

Can I speak to your supervisor?
I am the supervisor.

Look...
No. This isn't a looking game.

This is a listening game. You understand?
What?

You are a good mom. You were
a good cop at one point, too.

Who is this? - Let's explore who you are,
Sarah Crane. Formerly Sarah Erickson,

Graduated top of her academy
class, Three years service,

Then mysteriously, you
drop off the map. Why?

Left to start a family was
the story everyone heard.

Who the hell are you?
I'm the guy who has your daughter,

and I'm the guy who's gonnakill your
daughter, if, and this is a big if,

you don't do exactly what I say.

Hey! Hey, let me out of here!

Somebody help me!

What the hell have you
done with my daughter?

What am I about to do, you mean?

Don't you touch her. - That's wholly
up to you, Ms. Crane. - If you hurt her…

...it will be because
you chose to hurt her.

Now are you ready to listen?
Take your time. Take your time.

I want you to think about this.
How do I know you even have her?

Let me out! Somebody please let me out!

Sarah, pull us back on the road.

Please!

Somebody, let me out!

Sarah, it's completely natural for
you to want to protect your daughter.

Any parent who wouldn't shouldn't
be a parent in the first place,

but sometimes protecting them...
Means doing what you're told. Sarah?

Sarah? Are you there?

911 what's your
emergency? - Hello? Listen.

There's a man who has
kidnapped my daughter.

He's using Roadlink to talk to me.
I'm gonna leave the phone on so maybe

you can track the call or...

You can whisper all you want,Sarah.
It's not bringing your daughter home.

Oh, Sarah, if we're gonna
work together, we're gonna need

to learn how to trust each other...
because when you think about it,

in life, that's really all
we have it's what separates...

Thought I lost you. Now where were we?

Look, I know a little bit
about these situations.

I need to know that you have
her and that she is all right.

Oh, come on. Sarah, do
you honestly think...

Hey!

Stop! stop!

Stop!

Are you there? Hello?

Hello, are you there? I was in a tunnel.
Aren't we all?

I must admit, Sarah, It was very
frustrating watching everyone

turn their backs on you like that.
They immediately assumed the worst

about you. God, I hate this city.

Turn right up here on Buena Vista.

No bridges, No problems. We're not
going to be going through that again.

Sarah, I’ve been patient with you so far,
but if you try another stunt like that again,

you'll be shopping for a dress to
bury your daughter in, understood?

Yes. Just tell me what you want.

Of course. You are to find
and deliver to me a man

named Paulo Farina. He's not someone
I've been able to find in the online

white pages, if you understand what
I mean. He's slipped off the grid,

Which is why I need mommy
detective to give me access

to something I don't have access
to. - You seem pretty resourceful.

What don't you have access to?
It's funny but the police are

very secretive about
protecting their information.

You have the skills and connections
to get me what I want. 14 years ago,

you could find people
that no one else could.

So it's time to go back to work. Time to
get back piece of yourself that you gave up.

That will feel pretty good, I'll bet.

Why do I get the feeling
you've done this before?

You know, your husband
wouldn'tlisten either, and,

look where it got him.

What do you know about my husband?
As it turns out, a great deal.

He didn't have what it takes, And
Sarah, all it takes is listening.

Remember? Either you love
your daughter, Or you don't.

You answer that question by
giving me what I want, Understood?

Don't threaten my daughter.
I am a cop. With cop friends.

There is no way...
No. No. You're a housewife

with a dead husband and
possibly a dead daughter.

I can find people all right, Do you
understand me? And I can find you.

Do you think you have friends?
Do you think you have friends?

A quick experiment.

Dispatch.
Hi, this is Roadlink.

I have a client who's reporting
she needs some roadside assistance.

She sounds pretty desperate.
Location and license plate?

She's in the 1400 block Of
Maple. 144.2 Degrees longitude,

97 Degrees latitude.
We have an officer in the area.

California license plate PCI 140.
An officer has been dispatched.

Great, thanks so much.
What are you doing?

What did they teach you in the
academy, Sarah? I over E, right?

Intellect over emotion? The
cop over the mother? Come on,

you know how kidnappings turn
out, Sarah. Use your I over your E.

Go to hell!
Emotions.

Your "E" motions would tell
you, "have the authorities trace

the whack job's computer and they
arrest him," But your intellect...

your intellect says, "if I do that,
my daughter will suffer horribly,

and I’ll never see her again."

Oh, you might want to pull over.

So really, it's what Part of the
equation do you lean toward, Sarah?

I over E or E over I?

You might want to check that message.

E says tell the cop. I says don't.

Both of them are screaming
at you that your daughter's

probably gonna die
anyway, but... maybe not.

And Sarah, I think this goes without
saying, if you say anything to cop,

or set one foot outside the car,
I'm afraid I'll have to kill her.

Afternoon, ma'am. We
got a roadlink report

about you being in a little bit of
trouble, Need some police assistance?

No, that was a mistake.
There's no emergency anymore.

Anymore? So there was an emergency?

No, not exactly.

You all right, ma'am?

Yeah. There was this black
Cadillac, And it was tailgating me.

Well, I thought it was following me.
It seemed like it was following me.

I guess I just got a little nervous. - I'm gonna
have to ask you to step out of the car, ma'am.

For what?
Standard procedure.

Oh, I know procedure. - I asked you
to step out of the car. - Please.

You been drinking, ma'am?
No.

Step out of the car.

I'm a cop. I was. Precinct 13.

My husband is, was Edward Crane.

I guess I was just overreacting when I called
it in. It's been a bit of a readjustment.

I heard about what
happened to your husband.

Some of the guys in my unit,
they used to work with him.

Said he was a good man.
The best.

You're sure there's nothing wrong?
I'm sorry for the confusion.

I guess I'm just a little
bit on edge, you know?

All right, well, if
there's anything else...

you're in good hands.

Thanks. - Have a good
afternoon, Ms. Crane.

Well done, Ms. Crane.

Say, Sarah. Why did you
Roll your window down?

You really wanna see
what I can do, don't you?

Sarah, quick question. Do you know how
many millions of cars have Roadlink in them?

I don't know. How many?

Really, it only takes one.

#MAN ON ROADLINK KIDNAPPED
MY DAUGHTER#

Sarah. You have work to do.

I can't leave the scene of an accident.
I think you have more pressing obligations.

Don't you?

Sarah,
What are you doing?

I am getting help for that
officer. I will be back in seconds.

Don't touch my daughter.
No, no, Sarah, Sarah. Sarah!

You okay? It's gonna be okay.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

It's gonna be okay.
Dispatch, Officer down, copy?

Roger that. What's your 20?
I 394 westbound

near the Clearwater Bridge.
Request immediate assistance, copy?

Emergency service has beendispatched.
Ma'am, what's your name?

Ma'am? - Help me. - Are
you in any danger, ma'am?

I'm sorry. - Ma'am, do you need any
help? Ma'am, are you there?

Oh, are you okay?

Ms. Crane, you have now seen what
I can do when I'm not even there.

Need I remind you your daughter
is in the very next room.

Put your car in D and
pull back onto the road.

Sarah, don't feel bad about
that cop back there. Technically,

technically, that wasn't your fault.

So this guy Farina, What, did he
steal Dungeons and Dragons cards?

Questions make you feel
In control, don't they?

I've had a question I've been meaning
to ask you. When you found out that

daughter was missing, did it
bring up any of those bad memories?

I don't know what you're
talking about. - Come on, Sarah.

Your last case, remember?

That greasy perv who nabbed
that kid from the playground.

You must've really been in over
your head for him just to...

kill her right in front of you. Just
like that. - What do you want?

Forgive me. I have one more question,
And tell me if I'm be too personal.

Did you think that having a
kid of your own would make up

for the one that you lost? Because I
don't think the karma works that way.

So this guy Farina.
What have you got on him?

Yes.

Paulo Farina Is in police
protection before he testifies as to

the nature of our crime.
Secret witnesses in

secret locations, and
files on internal police

networks mean that I
don't have access to him.

You have access to
those files. Get them.

Can you zoom in a bit more?

Zoom in on her hand.

Little more. Right there.
What is she passing him?

So who's Detective Irons?
I don't know. So where am I going?

You don't know your husband's ex
partner? The man who shot and killed

him and then showed up on
your doorstep this morning.

Tell me, did you wanna hurt him? I
think even I would've to hurt him.

So what are you gonna do with
Farina when I bring him to you?

I'm going to give you
your daughter back.

Traffic seems ligh en route to your
destination. You have 19 minutes

to get me what I want, and get back in the
car. You're on the clock now. My clock.

Let's begin.

Dispatch.
This is Detective Irons.

Could you put me through to the
Roadlink corporate Office, please?

Sarah, what are you doing
here? - I really need your help.

What's wrong, hon? - It's
Kimmy. She's missing.

She wentout to meet some guy on
the internet, And I can't find her.

So do you know who the creep is?
Yeah. Well, maybe.

See, that's why I'm here. I just need
to dig on the department database.

Just to make sure.
Yeah, well, you give me his stats.

Believe me, I'll find
that cretin's records.

Priscilla. It would be better
if you didn't get too involved.

What's going on?

Sar?

I just need to look the database
alone. I don't have much time.

Until what?

Priscilla, you know
me better than anyone.

And I wouldn't ask you if
I didn't really need it.

So I'm gonna step away for a minute.

So if you wanna wait here,
I'll be back in a few minutes.

Come on, come on.
Oh, officer, there's a lady...

#WITNESS FARINA PAULO
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY - CLASS B#

What?

Hey. Hey! Where are you?

Open it! - Okay, "A" I'm the only
one with the keys to that door,

and "B"... I guess you
don't really need to know "B"

if you already know "A" right?
Open it! Where are the keys?

Okay, Kimmy, Yes, you have the
gun. The thing about guns is,

no matter what side you're
on, it's always the wrong one.

Open the door!
Kimmy!

Mom? What are you doing, you freak?

We're both here, Ms. Crane.
Farina is at the Aldergrove Motel.

Now, take that info and
give me back my daughter.

Open the door! - Kimmy, if evolution's
right, man will lose all of his limbs

except for the push button finger.

I'm gonna have to require that
you put the gun down now, Kimmy.

Don't. Kimmy, shoot him.
Kimmy, just shoot him!

She's not like you, Sarah.
Takes a lot to pull a trigger.

You have to shoot him!

So you were like your mother, after all.

That's good to know.

Okay, now I’m gonna have to ask
that you put down the glass, Kimmy.

You do
not want to see what this button does.

I don't care!
I don't care?

The three most dangerous
words in the world.

What are you doing?
Turn it back on!

Go, go, go, Sarah? Cars
are made to go, not to stop.

Stop it! - Come on, Kimmy.
Turn your mommy's brakes back on.

Run, Kimmy! Get out of there!

Fine, fine, okay.
No! no!

Put this on.

Start the car.
That is wholly up to you.

Done!
Okay, now your wrists.

I can't tighten these.
Use your teeth.

Start the car!
Okay.

We're all doing fine
here, Ms. Crane, just fine.

Aldergrove motel. 16 miles
away. You have 37 minutes

to get Farina back
into your custody. Go.

Is it a crime that my best
friend came to visit me?

She's in trouble, Priscilla. Help me
help her. Just tell what she wanted.

What's she gotten into?

I don't know, but she's acting a
hell of a lot like Ed did that night.

You have to promise
that you'll protect her.

I can't promis a thing. If she'dirty,
we both know what has to be done.

Right there, right there.

Wait a second. Farina?!

Yes? - Yeah, officer, Looks like somebody
smashed out your car window.

You must have the wrong room.
Oh, okay. I didn't know

if you had anything important in
there that could've gotten stolen.

I'm sorry. You got the wrong room.

Okay. Just didn't want
you to get in trouble.

Sorry, newbie, I don't have time.

Farina! Open the door!

I've been sent to deliver you
and whoever it is wants you bad.

He'll kill me. - Who's he?
You don't know Wilkes?

Not yet.
Where is he?

He's not here.
He's everywhere!

He's not stop, and I am notgonna
let a bathroom door stop me either.

Step aside.

Okay, okay. He'll kill me.

He'll kill my daughter.

Look, what do you wanna
know? I'll tell you anything.

We all worked together on some
stuff. - But? - But I got to know

a little too much about him. He
doesn't like that. And now I'm...

Evidence. He's erasing
all of his evidence.

Priscilla, I need one more favor.

Let's go. Now!

Get in.

This is Irons. I have an
officer down. I need assistance.

How are you, Paulo? Cat got your tongue?

Say something.

I'm sorry. You know, about all this.

You're a tough man to find when
you quit accessing your bank

and credit cards, Paulo. And Sarah,
you've created quite a stir already.

Word on the police band is you've gotten a
gun from one of our city's finest. That's good.

That'll come in handy.
So where do I bring him, Wilkes?

I see you're still
quite the talker, Paulo.

Sarah, there is a junkyard on
Portland street on the East end.

There's a surveillance camera.
You're to bring Paulo there.

Bring the gun.

Kim will be there?
Trade for trade.

Please. I got kids.
So do I.

Hello? Can anyone hear me?

Hello? Help!

You handing me over is
just like you killing me.

You might as well pull
that trigger right now.

Sarah. Why don't we work
this out? I can get you money.

Would you take money for your kid?

Sarah, What the hell
happened? Where's Farina?

Farina!
Sarah!

Farina!

Farina!

Toley's. - Hello, this is Officer Colin
Bailey with the LAPD.

Well, how can I help you? - Sir, we have
an APB out on an escaped female prisoner.

She may be making her way towards you.

She may be trying to use
your phone or steal a car.

Well, is she dangerous?
Well, I would lock my doors if I were you.

She shot two officers already
and she has nothing to lose.

Farina!

Farina!

Farina!

Come on, Farina. I'm
not gonna turn you in.

I'm just playing along until I can
figure out a way to find this guy.

Come on. I know you're here.

Come on, Farina.

Relax, I'm not...

Don't move.
I'm a cop.

Yeah, sure you are. Back up, cop killer.

Let me explain.
Back up and turn around.

I got the call. The run is over.

What call? - I ain't letting no cop
killing escaped convict handle no gun so...

so I'll take it. It's mine anyway.

I was transporting
her And she jumped me.

He's lying.
You're a cop?

Transport officer.
Listen to me. He's lying. He's the felon.

Hey!

He's not taking my gun.

No!

Farina, don’t do this.
I ain't going!

You just killed my daughter.

Sarah? Sarah?

Sarah? Sarah!

All units, We have a report of
gunfire off Robertson Canyon.

Sarah?
Pris? It's me.

What the heck is going
on with you? Are you okay?

Things aren't so good. I
don't have a whole lot of time.

Sarah, you gotta watch your
back. There's a lot of people

coming down on you right now.
All right, did you find anything out?

Well, it's bizarre.
Well, talk quick.

Raymond Wilkes' newborn
son and wife Disappear off

The face of the earth In the mid 70's. - Well,
then, that's not the Wilkes I'm looking for.

Then one day a six year old kid is
found wandering the neighborhood.

He tells a neighbor he's been
trying to wake up his mom,

but she started to smell funny
So he went to get help for her.

So the cops go back to Wilkes' house
to find the mom deader than dead

and the father hanging
by a rope in the garage.

Now, fantastic guy that he was, he
had built a little prison inbasement.

Kept them both down there right
after the little guy was born.

Then little Sheldon Wilkes
became the property of the state,

And moved from home to home, never
adjusted to being around people.

Poor kid. - Yeah, I wouldn't feel too
sorry for him. What else?

Well, and then all records just
stop when the kid's 18 like he was...

Christ!
Where are you? Sarah?

Sarah? Sarah? Sarah?

Sarah? Sarah? Sarah!

Don't do this!

Wilkes, I'm here. - What the hell happened?
Where's Farina? I heard gunshots.

He's in the backseat. Calm down.

No, he's not. The pressure
sensor Says it's empty.

He's on the floor.
Don't lie to me!

Mr. Hart.

Mr. Hart?

It's not a good time right now.

Could you open the door, please?

Not one word, Sarah. Understood?

Get out of the car, Sarah. Get out now!

Hands where I can see them! Now!

Mr. Hart! We've had complaints about
a leak coming from your bathroom.

I'm looking at it right
now, and it seems fine.

Well, I need to check it myself.

I don't have time.
I am trying to help you.

That's not the way he wants it.
That's not how who wants it?

Sarah, I read the note.
What the hell is going on with Roadlink?

Someone has my daughter
and he is going to kill her.

Someone has Kimmy? - Hart, if you
don't open the door, I'm coming in.

It'll be just a minute.

You're Hart? I know you like
these left outside your door.

You know, these window coverings,
they could be a fire hazard.

I have to get back in that car or
Wilkes is gonna kill my daughter.

Listen. Listen to me.
Look, just let me help you.

We both know how these things
end, Sarah, he will kill her.

No, he won't.

Did you do this?

You got a key to this?

What the hell is going on?

Kimmy? Kimmy?

Kimmy!

Don't look at me.
Are you there?

Kimmy, Get out of there
Any way! Can you hear me?

Kimmy!

I'm gonna need you to
put the keys on the table

and get back into the bathroom now.

Close the door, please.

Ms. Crane.
What just happened?

I want you to know you both
brought this upon yourselves.

With no Farina, there's no deal.
Wait! No, no, no!

Goodbye, Ms. Crane.
Wait!

Wilkes? Wilkes? Farina's here.

He's seen better days but he's here.

Pull out on the road
and go straight ahead.

How was the run, Paulo?

What? what? What was that? What?

It's your friend talking with
a mouthful of broken teeth.

How far away from you am I?

10 minutes. North.

All right, So I'm gonna see my
daughter alive in 10 minutes, right?

No, one stop first.

What are we doing here?

In my brief time with your husband,
I learned that your verbose guest in

the backseat shared with him some
personal information about me.

Now, Roadlink tells me that Eddie
Spaghetti visited this facility

on his last night, Yet there's
no locker in his name, Sarah.

Could be nothing. Could beeverything.
I'm leaning towards the latter.

If you're so sure that Ed had records
on you, why didn't you just come out

and get them yourself?
What?

Must've been so frightening,

being used to that dark cell.

And then all of a sudden, all
of those people around you,

getting moved around from
one foster family to the next.

It'd make me want to keep
my distance from people too.

I know what you're trying to do, and...

It must've been so frightening,
And you must've felt so helpless.

You want your daughter alive?
Come on, Wilkes.

We both know that you need me
'cause you can't leave your house.

Just quit your pathetic attempt
at psychoanalyzing me, and just…

Just do your job, Ms. Crane.

You have 10 minutes.
Not one second more.

So...I've been pulling babysitting
duty on this guy Paulo Farina

And he tells me some interesting
things about Sheldon Wilkes,

who he's gonna testify
against if we can find Wilkes.

The thing with Wilkes is he's a ghost.

They don't know anything about
him. So I got out and see if I can,

you know, dig something up on him.
You know, help the suits. You know,

maybe I can bust something open,
Maybe I can finally make detective.

So I started looking for Wilkes,
And well, today he found me instead.

He says he's hurt you and Kimmy,
Sarah, if I don't bring him Farina.

Whatever happens, I did this
to protect you too, okay?

I guess if you're seeing this, I'm gone.

I'll keep you and Kimmy safe.

Give all this Information
to Irons. He's a good guy.

He'll know how to find Wilkes.

Eddie thought he'd found Wilkes
when he busted in that door.

The bastard set him up
and I knocked him down.

We gotta go.

Did you get what we need? - Yes. - If
I find there was anything left behind...

There's nothing missing. It's
a good thing, too, Wilkes.

There's a lot of
information on you in here.

There's even a house address.Dunsmore
Street. That sound like home?

Yeah, Eddie thought he found
me, too. You both get a zero.

It's... It's 3400 Marine drive, number
24. Farina and your backpack

equals one daughter, Alive and well.

All units, officers need backup,
3400 Marine drive. Apartment 24.

Kimmy?

Kimmy?

Where is she? Kimmy!

Kimmy.

She's not here. We gotta go. Sarah,
she's not here. Come on, we gotta go.

We gotta go, Sarah. We gotta go.

No.

Sarah!

No!

Wilkes!

Wilkes?
She's gone. You killed her.

No, she's alive. You're too
smart to toss in your chips now.

You give me Kimmy, And you can still
slip off the grid and never lookback.

No Farina, no deal.

You're forgetting what I have
in my backpack. Information.

Information All about
you. I over E, remember?

Use your I over E.

You had a good plan. It's gonna
work, Wilkes, and you know it,

But before this goes any further,
I need to know Kimmy is still alive.

Wilkes?

Speak.
Mom, it's okay. I'm okay.

Your house 15 minutes, time Go.

Okay, if there is anything
wrong with her, no deal.

You don't make the deals! - I am t
he deal. 15 minutes, my house, timed.

Hey.

Hey.

Wilkes.
Wilkes!

Welcome home, Sarah.

Close the door behind you.

Everything okay, Wilkes?
You don't sound so good.

Close the door.

Where are you?
I'm everywhere.

I don't think that's true anymore,
Wilkes. You know when they re-release

animals into the wild, most times,
they run right back to their cages.

Where did you run to, Wilkes?

You didn't come this far
to kill your daughter.

I wanna know that she's okay.

She's fine. - I wanna
see her. - She sees you.

You're lying.
I haven't lied to you once, Sarah.

Where is she?

She's in a good place.
So, all of this,

You killing Farina, Irons, my husband,

all so you can remain anonymous?
You that afraid of the world, Wilkes?

So now what? Where you gonna go?
Where are you gonna go now, Wilkes?

I wanna talk to my daughter.

Now take your husband's files
and put them on the floor.

Put gun there too.

Light them on fire.

I'll burn half now. You give me my
daughter, Then I'll burn the rest.

You burn half of the evidence,
I'll give you half your daughter.

Put that videotape in too.
No.

What? - No, I'm not gonna do it. This is the
only thing keeping my daughter alive.

Sarah. Put the videotape in the fire.

No, Wilkes. You're gonna have to
come out here and do it yourself,

'cause I wanna see my daughter. I'm
keeping this,until you bring me my

daughter, unharmed, here, now.

Put the tape in the fire!

You're gonna have to crawl out
of your cave and face me, Wilkes.

I know you're close. You're not
gonna be free until you get this,

and you're not getting this
until I get my daughter.

Hey... Help!

What are you gonna do?
You don't even have a home.

That's gotta suck? -Shut up.

Mrs. Crane? This is Roadlink.
I see there's been an accident.

I'm sending emergency
personnel right away.

Look at me, Wilkes.

Ms. Crane.

Mom!

My baby!

Are you okay?
Yeah.

We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

Sarah, Kimmy, I know I
probably didn't say it enough.

This kind of thing
wasn't my strong suit.

That's why I was gonna give
you this on our anniversary.

#LIFE IS NOT MEASURED HOW MANY BREATHS YOU TAKE,
BUT BY HOW OFTEN YOUR BREATH IS TAKEN AWAY#

You two, took my breath away every day.

I love you, and I know that
you love me. - You better.

Wanna go for a walk?

If I can play you this
new tune I found. - Okay.

It's kinda loud but I
think you can handle it.
