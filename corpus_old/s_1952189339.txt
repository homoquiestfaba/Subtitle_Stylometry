since they went out together. 

58 
And then she just 
went to drink. 

59 
Have you tried to 
to talk to her? 

60 
Maybe, I do not know. If I did it

61 
and she became very defensive. 

62 
Is this not beautiful? 

63 
Let me see. 

64 
No.

Give me a moment. 

186

201 
How would you find

202 
somewhere with more privacy? 

203 
I believe that we have away. 

204 
Already? 
I only had a few drinks. 

205 
We know that. 

206 
Come on, it is useless to 
any fun at all to the first night. 

207 
Sorry dibs. 
This dance is about. 

208 
Who says that?

209 
I think I 
should leave now.

211 
She goes next 
week married, motherfucker. 

212 
I'm getting laid tonight, 
So fuck you, bitch. 

213 
Damn. 

214 
That was cool. 
That was not fun. 

215 
I should have had done. 
That was hilarious. 

216 
Every time we go out, 
is one of us into trouble. 

217 
And do you know anyone in 
his balls. 

218 
It's fun. 
It's like a tradition. 

219 
I wish we 
one could go out once 

220 
and just a nice, quiet 
night could have. 

221 
Because that would be only one 
bachelor party are real cool. 

222 
Well, we now 
Just go home, please? 

223 
Give me a dick to 
to pierce that wall down. 

224 
Hello. 

225 
Finally. 
Took them this time? 

226 
Sorry, Beth. 
it goes well with me. 

227 
Do you thank her for 
the spoiling of my week? 

228 
She sounds very angry. 

229 
She has a hangover. Create 
you worry about. 

230 
See you there in 15 minutes. 

231 
We are not in the house. 
We have guides who met 

232 
there at the beach and we 
go look around a bit. 

233 
Okay, I see you there. 

234 
Beth, you let me have 
in the lurch? Let's go. 

235 
Sorry. We can 
not wait. 

236 
You know how it is. 

237 
But we see you at the cottage 
for dinner. 

238 
Promise. Have fun. And 
Take care. 

239 
That we do. 
Bye. 

240 
Thank you. 

241 
What is going on? 

242 
My friends, we dumped 
before noon. 

243 
Would you like to have a 
eat? 

244 
A morning quickie first. 

245 
Fast enough for you? 

246 
Maybe a little 
too fast. 

247 
I now take a shower. 

248 
Great. I 
There also one can use. 

249 
Hair of the dog? 

250 
No. 

251 
That is why you should never 
drinking on an empty stomach. 

252 
This tour is 
a little boring. 

253 
I do not believe this 
the tour is. 

254 
I think this is just one 
wretched-looking country. 

255 
Can you not simply return to us 
bringing the beach or something? 

256 
Are there no nice 
landscapes or something? 

257 
Yes, yes. 

258 
We will take you to 
bring a nice place ... 

259 
... very nice ... 
just like you, right? 

260 
I think he'll like it. 

261 
Fuck you. 
Fuck yourself. 

262 
Fuck yourself. 
Fuck yourself. 

263 
What is your problem? 

264 
I have no problem. 
You're such a bitch. 

265 
Let's do it now, man. 

266 
I would not get too close. 

267 
You think we're far enough? 

268 
It is good. Let 
do it now. 

269 
Thanks for the tacos. That 
was a great restaurant. 

270 
I only wished 
you'd let me pay. 

271 
Why? 

272 
Is this not technically 
our first date? 

273 
I would say that 
Bar was our first date. 

274 
Yesterday was our second 
be. 

275 
That makes this ... 
Our third. 

276 
You know what 
that means. 

277 
Your home, or 
mine? 

278 
Mine is closer. 

279 
So I walk inside 

280 
and the guy is 
Kathleen her bed 

281 
and he is naked 
and tied. 

282 
And the best part is ... 
he cries, 

283 
blubbering like a baby. 

284 
He said I 
to mean. 

285 
So there you have it 
just left? 

286 
That you never told me. 

287 
That is so funny. 

288 
Why are we stopping? 

289 
Since this is your stop, whore. 
Get out of the van. 

290 
Get out! 

291 
Kathleen! 

292 
No. Let me go. 

293 
Take it! 
Take it! 

294 
Hi, Beth. 
Sophia, they have shot Kat! 

295 
I do not know where they are! | 

296 
What? 
Where are you? 

297 
He drove laps with us. 
There is a palm tree and ... 

298 
My heavens, 
He is coming. 

299 
Beth? 

300 
Throw that damn phone down! 

301 
Oh, shit. 

302 
My girlfriend called me. 
It sounds like they are in trouble Sat 

303 
I think something has happened. 
Are they missing? 

304 
Yes, they are missing. 
And said that a friend was shot. 

305 
Señorita, you should calm down a bit. 

306 
I can not help you if you do not get quiet. 

307 
Ok, 
Sorry. 

308 
Well, how long are your friends already missing? 

309 
They were four hours ago 
avoided, I think. 

310 
They have only four hours away? 

311 
Is this a joke? 

312 
No no, she said 
they saw a building 

313 
and palm trees 
and a bell or something. 

314 
He hung up. 
What? 

315 
Police 
Just hung up. 

316 
Damn Mexico. 
All I want is a little help .. 

317 
Where is the U.S. embassy? 
They will do something. 

318 
There is no embassy here. 

319 
You must 
Mexico City call themselves. 

320 
But I think 
that not much will help. 

321 
It was only a few hours. 

322 
Maybe they 
have a joke with you. 

323 
A joke? 
Why would they do that? 

324 
Maybe your back 
address because you went out with me. 

325 
You said Kathleen 
very angry. 

326 
Kathleen would never ... 
Okay, maybe that would do Kathleen, 

327 
but Beth would never go. 

328 
Let's ask around. 

329 
Maybe someone saw 
they do at the beach. 

330 
Ok. 

331 
Yes, I could take a few pictures to show. 

332 
How is your Spanish? 

333 
They will not fight. 

334 
Cord her mouth. 

335 
Who did you call hell, 
little girl? 

336 
Does not stand, do you? 

337 
Give me your money and jewelry. 

338 
Give me your money and jewelry. 

339 
Phones too. 

340 
I have mine with me. 

341 
Check it. 

342 
No, no, please. 

343 
You're lucky you're so thin, 

344 
not worth further 
are for rape. 

345 
Your ring. Give me your purse. 

346 
He wants you ring. 

347 
Just give it to him. 

348 
But it is my 
engagement ring. 

349 
Grab it! 

350 
No, please do not. 

351 
Bye, bitches. 

352 
Watch out 
for coyotes, huh? 

353 
Wait. 

354 
Wait. 

355 
Stop the car! 
You can not simply just leave us here! 

356 
What do we do now? 

357 
Come here and help me. 

358 
Keep the pressure on it, 
okay? 

359 
My ring. 

360 
Priorities ... 

361

362 
Those damn bastards ... 

363 
When I see them again, 
I'll kill them. 

364 
Is it bad? 

365 
She was shot. 
That is not good. 

366 
Am I dead? 

367 
No, you will not die. 

368 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 

369 
I make a bottleneck link. 
We must stop the bleeding. 

370 
Ok. 
It is good. 

371 
Til. 

372 
I'm dying or not then? 
I'm dying. 

373 
Shut up. I told you, 
You will not die. 

374 
Yell at me. 

375 
Do we know what road to the town? 

376 
I do not know. 
I'm really confused. 

377 
Sophia will call for help. 
And we wait then? 

378 
How should they know where we are? 

379 
There ... 
I see a reflection 

380 
No, it is not. 

381 
What do you what it is? 

382 
I do not know the 
looks like a building. 

383 
Perhaps there is someone who can help. 

384 
-Can you stand? 
No. 

385 
I'll help you. 
I'll help you. 

386 
I told Sophia about. 
I told her that I've seen. 

387 
Quiet. You can. 

388 
Damn, man. 
You know damn what time it is? 

389 
It is 6:30 P.M., Jeremy. 

390 
What? 
Really? 

391 
Sorry. 

392 
Are you still drunk? 

393 
A small cat that's all. 

394 
I mean, I was a little 
went crazy when you say, ... 

395 
Sophia. 

396 
Hi. Ok. 

397 
Hi again. 

398 
How's Beth? 

399 
We hope in us 
can help with something. 

400 
Listen, I do not cross swords with you. 

401 
So if we make it up ... 
You speak Spanish, right? 

402 
We need you to take the 
city people talking ... City folk ... 

403 
because we think that her friends 
abducts his 

404 
and we can not talk to him. 

405 
Good night. 
No, please. 

406 
What is this place? 

407 
Perhaps a kind of army camp? 

408 
Who cares? 
Let's go fuck in this heat. 

409 
We will see if anyone is home. 

410 
We can a little from the sun 

411 
and we at Kat's leg elevation. 

412 
Hello? 

413 
It looks abandoned. 

414 
I do not like what this place looks like. 

415 
Where should we go? 

416 
Let Kat to bring inside. 

417 
Here, here. 
Put her down here. 

418 
Damn. 

419 
Keep your leg to high. 

420 
It appears to heal, 
which is good. 

421 
Try not to move otherwise 
the wound is open again, okay? 

422 
Try to be strong. 
Can you do that? 

423 
Well. 

424 
Why does this happen to me? 

425 
What kind of church is this? 

426 
Weird. 

427 
It seems as if they hurt each other. 

428 
I just do not understand 

429 
Why anyone would want to live here 

430 
in limbo. 

431 
I've found some candles 
and lanterns or something. 

432 
We can use them 
to walk back to town. 

433 
We must stay here tonight. 

434 
What? 
Why? 

435 
When the sun sets, we 
can see the lights of the city, right? 

436 
We do not know where the city is. 

437 
Did not look out there? 

438 
We are in the medium 
of nowhere. 

439 
Let us try. 
I do not like. 

440 
All I want is to 
place with a good bed 

441 
I feel safe. 

442 
Safe? This is the safest 
place we could find. 

443 
We can not in the dark cat to wear. 
That is too dangerous. 

444 
And I do not even agree what 
direction I should go. 

445 
We do not further 
what has come in the night ... 

446 
coyotes, snakes, 
I do not know. 

447 
But I would not take that risk. You? 

448 
And what now? 

449 
Hold your leg up. 

450 
So what we look for stocks. 

451 
You do not leave me alone, do you? 

452 
I love your company. 

453 
Well. Beth and I will look 
what we can find ... 

454 
Hopefully some 
water, and blankets, 

455 
Stuff to camp here tonight. 

456 
Promise me only that you return. 

457 
Trust me. 
We come back. 

458 
Come on. 

459 
These girls ... 
Have you seen them? 

460 
Sorry, I have not seen them. 

461 
Okay, he has not seen them. 

462 
Can we get a drink? 

463 
Let it rest. 
I am well with you. 

464 
Ask him if he knows something about 
the building in the desert 

465 
with the palm trees. 

466 
Do you know of a place in the 
desert 

467 
with palm trees and 
a bell tower 

468 
No, I do not know. 

469 
Thank you, sir. 

470 
Dick. 

471 
That is strange. 
Why did he so weird? 

472 
Everyone here is strange. 

473 
That is what "Mexico" means 
in the Mexican ... "weird." 

474 
Can we get a drink? 

475 
Well. 
Let the questions continue. 

476 
I said that somewhere in 
the beach to the drinking, 

477 
that's what 
we should be. 

478 
Thank God. 

479 
Cunt. 

480 
No. 
No. 

481 
No. 

482 
No phone, no water. 

483 
We have found no food, 
just empty rooms. 

484 
We should never stop. 

485 
What would we have done ... 

486 
Kathleen drag 
bleeding from the desert 

487 
until they fall away? 
And what then? Sitting in the dark 

488 
while death and wait 
the coyotes would come? 

489 
Would you have preferred, 

490 
you aching, stiff 
little bitch?! 

491 
Sorry. 

492 
I murder you! 

493 
Jess, what are you doing? 

494 
Sorry. 

495 
We are all stressed. 
That is the ... I am ... 

496 
Return to Kathleen 
and Amber. 

497 
Should not we be together? 

498 
I can take care of myself, but I know 
not certain of Kathleen and Amber. 

499 
You should go back to a 
eye to keep. 

500 
What are you doing? 

501 
There must be something here ... 

502 
water, first aid ... 
whatever. 

503 
And tomorrow we can try 
follow the sun 

504 
and to the west trying 
to go to the coast to find. 

505 
But we have to find material 

506 
because we will not sustain 
without equipment. 

507 
Be careful. 

508 
Not a very homey place, right? 

509 
Can it be 
We clean it up. 

510 
I think candles are fun. 

511 
I saw this past sandstone Mon 

512 
The previous owner loved it ... 
and I mean loved candlelight. 

513 
He had this individual candlesticks 

514 
in the hall and on the stairs. 
It was really fun. 

515 
The people I sold it to 
thought it was to die. 

516 
This place ... 
I just do not understand 

517 
something which so far 
can build 

518 
and then decorate 
with such artifacts. 

519 
It just has no sense. 

520 
I mean, where they used 
this place? 

521 
What think you, Kat? 

522 
Kathleen, is everything okay? 

523 
It would be much better to me, 
if you still would be. 

524 
You know, I talk when I'm nervous. 

525 
The pond outside is fun, 
although, 

526 
lined with trees. 

527 
There is at least one landscape. 

528 
Who first used this place 

529 
was certainly not a good decorator. 

530 
I can not imagine 
that many people here have been ... 

531 
Jesus Christ. 
No wonder Ryan deceived you, 

532 
you stupid girl. 

533 
What do you mean it? 

534 
I mean that men 
not like 

535 
as their friend 
but constantly talking 

536 
about nothing. 

537 
The only thing they want 
is a beautiful sight, 

538 
a nice ass and a place 
their dick to keep warm. 

539 
And the way you look, 

540 
that a man can not help it. 

541 
Why do you say this? 

542 
The guide did not even rape you. 

543 
Your boobs have shrunk to nothing. 

544 
Selfish cunt. 

545 
Think you can sit there but 
and evaluate me 

546 
and treat everyone like shit? 

547 
I do not know why Sophia 
always come to you. 

548 
I am not more 
baby-sit your ass. 

549 
You can just sit here 
and I bleed to death for something to give. 

550 
Where you going? 

551 
You can not leave me here. 

552 
I would say, "Eat me," 

553 
but I know you do not, 
'because you eat anything! 

554 
Fuck you. 

555 
Great bachelor party, 
by the way. 

556 
You're a great friend. 

557 
I can not believe that 
nobody has seen him. 

558 
I can not believe that 
nobody has seen them. 

559 
I have 20 drinks of your credit. 
Can you give me more money? 

560 
I can use it for good ... 
a whore, maybe. 

561 
Why are they so afraid when we 
the bell to ask? 

562 
I do not know, but we 
keep doing this? 

563 
Prefer to go inside 
to party? 

564 
It is her. 

565 
Where you going? 

566 
You. 

567 
Darkness is now very strong 
inside you. 

568 
What did she say? 

569 
I do not know. 
Something about a shadow, I think. 

570 
Ask her what she said last night. 

571 
What have you told her last night? 

572 
I saw it in her hand. 

573 
There is a very bad place in 
waiting for her and her friends 

574 
and, if they continue, 
death will come. 

575 
What is it? 
What did she say? 

576 
Something about you and your friends 

577 
die in a bad spot. 

578 
What? Which place? 
The spot with the bell? 

579 
Which place? 

580 
The spot with the bell? 

581 
With the palm trees? 

582 
Yes, yes. South of the border, 
at the old resort. 

583 
An old resort 
south of the city. 

584 
Resort? 

585 
What kind of resort? 

586 
Why does she think it scary? 

587 
Why is it ... why is it evil? 

588 
It was long ago, 
but bad things happen here, 

589 
and what comes in, 
will never get out. 

590 
Where are you? 

591 
Beth. 

592 
Amber. 

593 
Where are you? 
I need you. 

594 
Jessica. 

595 
Rot Mexico. 

596 
We had to go to Vegas. 

597 
Stupid bitching. 

598 
Great. 

599 
This is my party. 

600 
It is mine. 

601 
Hello. 

602 
Are you there? 

603 
God, what happens to me? 

604 
"This community is formed 

605 
hoping to find a new world 

606 
with no rules, 
no boundaries, 

607 
no social ... 

608 
and escape for those 

609 
their deepest desires 
wanted to explore 

610 
a life that our 
will allow all 

611 
to live a life without fear ... 

612 
opinion and fear of ridicule. 

613 
They came here to be the person 
she always dreamed to be. 

614 
Expenses have gone in 
the wind. 

615 
They make their clothes ... 

616 
uncontrolled sexual urge, 

617 
take what you want when you want. 

618 
Groan, scream of ecstasy, 

619 
the delicious pain behind each door. 

620 
We devoured everything in sight ... 

621 
eat, drink, life itself 

622 
have irresistible forces. 

623 
It was inevitable ... 

624 
death followed us all here 

625 
with the wind. 

626 
And we can not be 
might escape. " 

627 
"I can no longer control. 

628 
Passions are strong. 

629 
My need for power 
about life itself 

630 
is just too strong. 

631 
It whispers to me. 

632 
They are those out there 

633 
paradise that we will not understand. 

634 
They will never understand 

635 
the soul that is innovative 

636 
and those damned 
to hell. " 

637 
"It will never stop. 

638 
I will never stop. " 

639 
Oh, God. 

640 
Are you there? 

641 
Jess. 

642 
Amber. 

643 
You're it. 

644 
Where the hell have you been? 

645 
It's just a story. 

646 
It's just a story. 

647 
You do not really believe in 
those things, well then? 

648 
They seem to believe it. 

649 
That old bag is really 
angered. 

650 
Go get some shots for us. 

651 
And what nacho `s. 

652 
Good. 
I'm with you. 

653 
What do you need? 

654 
Two ... three tequila `s. .. 

655 
nacho and what `s. 

656 
Have you seen these girls? 

657 
No. 

658 
Excuse me, ma'am. 

659 
Everything good? 

660 
Yes, go Jeremy 
bring his drink. 

661 
Is that your friend? 

662 
Sorry. I do not speak Spanish. 
Let me ... 

663 
No, no, no. 
I speak English. 

664 
I thought you might ... 

665 
I've often. 

666 
What did you show the bartender? 

667 
My friends ... 

668 
they are gone. 

669 
I wonder if somebody can 
tell where they are 

670 
or who they are gone. 

671 
No, I have not seen them. 

672 
Have you seen these women? 
No. 

673 
Sorry. 

674 
Thanks. 

675 
You know someone might take me to 
south of the city can bring? 

676 
South of the city? 
Where? 

677 
I heard that this 
resort. 

678 
I think she can be. 

679 
You have problems finding people 

680 
that can bring you there. 

681 
I know. 
I've heard. 

682 
I think we maybe 
can bring ... 

683 
for a small fee, 
of course. 

684 
Wait, you know where it is? 
You know how to get there? 

685 
Everyone here knows where it is. 

686 
They will just not go. 

687 
So you going tonight? 
Not the evening. 

688 
Nobody goes there the evening before. 

689 
That place has a bad reputation, chica. 

690 
We wait for the sunrise. 

691 
No, but I can pay you. What does it cost 
tonight to go there? 

692 
Dangerous objects come here `s night. 

693 
Go home, take a 
shower and relax. 

694 
See you here tomorrow morning. 
Then we go, okay? 

695 
Ok. 

696 
What did she say? 

697 
She thinks her friend at 
The hotel is old. 

698 
How do they know? 
She said no. 

699 
But I bet that bitch 
has called her 

700 
and said she was. 

701 
Do you think they suspect us? 

702 
Why does that matter? 

703 
I care for them tomorrow. 

704 
Cheers. 

705 
We know these guys do not. 
How can we trust them? 

706 
I have no choice. 
How much money do they want? 

707 
It is a scammer. 

708 
You do not have to come 
if you do not want. 

709 
These are my friends. 
This is my problem. 

710 
No, no, of course, we go. 

711 
We show you not just go. 

712 
Okay? 

713 
Why should I go? 

714 
Okay? 

715 
You ok there? 

716 
Fuck you. 

717 
When was the last time 
your friends that you saw? 

718 
Two nights ago. I did yesterday morning 
talked to them, 

719 
but I have since not 
seen. 

720 
That is not good. 

721 
Has anyone else seen them? 

722 
One American tourist 
they like each other. 

723 
We have called the police. 

724 
She would not be bothered. 

725 
What she said about the police? 

726 
Do not worry, they help her 
with the search. 

727 
They do not find them, even though 
they knew it. 

728 
You know where you're going, right? 

729 
Goddamn. 

730 
Oh, God. 
Oh, God. 

731 
Oh my God. 

732 
Shit. 

733 
You should call a doctor. 
Keep quiet. 

734 
We have nothing to do. 
You turned the gun on us, remember? 

735 
We must leave here. 

736 
What should we do? 

737 
Oh, God, 
what have we done? 

738 
They have put them away ... 
Beth and everyone ... 

739 
and they have over them. 

740 
You killed us, just like you to 
our friends did, right? 

741 
We have never seen your friends. 

742 
Stop it. Stop it. 
Let me think. 

743 
Ok, 
we tie him up 

744 
and we take him to the resort. 

745 
No, let me not go. 

746 
Beautiful thieves with shot wounds 

747 
impose no requirements. 

748 
Cunt. 

749 
What have you done to him? 
No, no, no, nothing. 

750 
We took their money and everything, 

751 
but we left him lying on the side. 
We did not kill him. 

752 
Beth said you Cat lap. 

753 
I did not. 
She wanted to run away. 

754 
What have you done with them? 

755 
No doctor for you until 
We have found them. 

756 
Take us to the resort. 

757 
You go there not 
inside, well then? 

758 
Shut up. 
You can not enter. 

759 
That place lets you do things. 
Look, 

760 
I'm not leaving without 
my friends. 

761 
Take him away. 

762 
What? No, no, 
I brought you here, 

763 
but I'm not going inside. 

764 
Come on. I need a doctor, man. 

765 
There is no doctor to 
we have our friends. 

766 
I do not go inside. 

767 
Well. If you are not inside 
to go 

768 
You can stay here. 

769 
Let me not alone. 

770 
Please, leave me alone. 

771 
Leave me alone. 

772 
Hello. 

773 
After you. 

774 
What is that? 

775 
Is there anyone? 

776 
Has anyone a buggy? 

777 
What if they are not here? 

778 
What if they roam out there? 

779 
How do we find them? 

780 
Just try not to think. 

781 
They are here somewhere. 
You must. 

782 
Beth. 

783 
Amber. 

784 
Jessica. 

785 
Kathleen. 

786 
No need to shout. 

787 
I'm here. 

788 
Cat. 
Cat. 

789 
Luckily everything is well with you. 
Beth said you're fired. 

790 
Shot? 
I'm not fired. 

791 
I've never felt so good. 

792 
Where are the others? 

793 
They are here somewhere. 

794 
We have a bus. 
Let us get back and go to town. 

795 
Would you all away so quickly? 

796 
You should now see the stars the evening. 

797 
It is so peaceful. 

798 
What, Cat? 

799 
Why are you so strange? 

800 
I do not know what you mean. 

801 
Want to look the other girls. 

802 
Ok. 

803 
Follow me. 

804 
Kat, what happens? 
Then Beth said she called for help ... 

805 
Is not this place beautiful? 

806 
Of course. 
How did you find? 

807 
We looked for help. 

808 
And we found it. 

809 
Onze Vader Die in de Hemelen zijt, 

810 
Hallowed be thy name. 

811 
Your kingdom come, 

812 
Your name will be done, 
In Heaven as on Earth. 

813 
Give us this day our daily bread ... 

814 
And it does us all 
much help. 

815 
What are you talking about? 

816 
Find out. 

817 
You lead. 

818 
If you insist. 

819 
Untranslated -- 

820 
It can help you all. 

821 
What happens there? 

822 
Untranslated -- 

823 
Sophie. 

824 
Jeremy? 

825 
We are here to bring you home. 

826 
I want to go home. 

827 
We must get the other and 
you get here. 

828 
The other? 

829 
Amber and Jessica ... 
where are they? 

830 
I do not know. 

831 
What is going on here? 

832 
It is strange, 
Sophie ... I ... 

833 
What? 

834 
I will not tell you. 

835 
Do not be afraid. 
Tell me. 

836 
Where's your other friend go? 

837 
What? Jesus. 
Cat! 

838 
Come on, we gotta go. 
I 'm not going anywhere. 

839 
We have to. 
It is not safe. 

840 
I'm not! 

841 
Sophie, I do not know what 
happen to me. 

842 
Leave me alone. 

843 
You know what? 
You find the other. 

844 
I'll stay here with her. 

845 
Take care. 

846 
We do. And let her 
clothes to keep, okay? 

847 
We are back soon. 

848 
It is good. 

849 
Please, I need a doctor. 

850 
Listen 

851 
I'm ready. 

852 
Are you that? 

853 
Amber. 
Jessica. 

854 
Kathleen. 

855 
No! 
Jesus Christ. 

856 
Eat! 

857 
Amber, what are you doing? 
What have you done? 

858 
What the hell is this? 

859 
No, that's my girlfriend. 
Amber, I am ... Sophia. 

860 
Listen to me. 
Stop it. 

861 
I do not think they can hear you. 
Stop it! 

862 
Stop it! 

863 
Pick the furniture. 

864 
She has lost her mind. 

865 
They let it go. 

866 
We all. 
We are all relieved. 

867 
Jess, you do not. 

868 
We are in trouble. 
We should not trust. 

869 
But I've made. 
I took care of that bastard. 

870 
I can not do much without it. 

871 
Can you hear them ... 

872 
the voices in the wind? 

873 
They call you. 

874 
I hear nothing. 

875 
Want to know why you are afraid ... 

876 
afraid to be free? 

877 
Go here, damn. 

878 
Just in the bus. 
And do not stop. 

879 
Get away from me. 
Just go now. Do not stop. 

880 
Beth! 
Jeremy! 

881 
Beth. 
Jeremy. 

882 
What have you done? 

883 
Why? 

884 
Why not? 

885 
You're not Beth. 
Where is she? 

886 
Of course I am. 
Sophie, I am. 

887 
You're not yourself. 
I know. 

888 
But everyone can change. 

889 
Let me hurt you. 

890 
Why would you do? 
We are friends, but ... 

891 
best friends? 

892 
Remember what you said to me 

893 
You and Sarah were the seventh grade 

894 
after you had helped me 
with a small problem? 

895 
You said you felt you free. 

896 
Go away from me. 

897 
Now I know what really means Fri. 

898 
Now I know what I missed. 

899 
Get the fuck away from me! 

900 
Please try again. 

901 
Can you hear? 

902 
It is so loud. 

903 
Can not you hear? 

904 
You try not to 
the bus to go, right? 

905 
You should know that it does not work. 

906 
There is only one thing 
what you can do. 

907 
Sophie. 

908 
Where were you? 
Why you left us? 

909 
Leave me if not. 

910 
Sophie. 

911 
I am so sorry. 

912 
Oh, God, no. 

913 
Want to save yourself? 

914 
What you are. 

915 
All your friends are dead 

916 
second. 

917 
You can not make me 
her murder. 

918 
Really, darling, stop running. 

919 
There is only one thing 
what you can do. 

920 
No. 

921 
No, no! 

922 
Can you hear it? 

923 
I can hear. 

924 
Stay there. 
Stop there. 

925 
I can not stop. 
No one can. 

926 
Jessica, I am. 
Do you remember me? 

927 
Why are you doing this? 

928 
Because you are free. 
That is the point. 

929 
That is nonsense. 

930 
I am free to do 
what I want! 

931 
You will never hurt me. 

932 
It wants me. 
I thought you could hear. 

933 
Stop, please. 

934 
I want to do this. 
Let me do this. 

935 
You will, if you would just listen. 

936 
Listen. 
Listen! 

937 
Jess. 
Oh, God, Jess. 

938 
Sophie? 

939 
Sophia. 

940 
Oh, God. 
What is going on? 

941 
What happens to me? 

942 
It is good. 
You're okay. 

943 
You're alive. 
That is all that counts. 

944 
Okay, okay. 

945 
Kathleen ... 

946 
where is she? 

947 
She is okay. 

948 
Everyone is okay. 

949 
I do not want anymore. 

950 
I want to go home. 

951 
I want to go home. 

952 
I will take care of you, okay? 

953 
Okay? 
Everything is good. 

954 
Yes. 

955 
Sophia. 

956 
Wait.
Wait, what are you ...?
