OLIVER:
My name is Oliver Queen.

For five years, l was stranded
on an island with only one goal:

Survive.

OIiver Queen is aIive.

OLIVER:
Now, l will fulfill my father's dying wish...

...to use the list of names he left me...

...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

To do this,
l must become someone else.

l must become something else.

Previously on Arrow:

You toId me to stay away
from your famiIy.

But your famiIy isn't staying away from me
which means something must be done.

Where can I find the man
in this picture?

Do you not think it convenient
you captured me easiIy?

YAO FEI:
Run!


FYERS: Do you even know
what this isIand reaIIy is?

It's a prison.
What wouId you do in my position?

[CLUB MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO]

Whatever you're Iistening to,
it ain't music.

[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO]

-There ought to be a Iaw.
-WeII, there's not. So....

[CLUB MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO]

[GUN CLICKS]

GUARD:
Yo, watch it.

Hey, he's got a gun.

[MEN GROANING]

[BOTH COUGHING]


THEA:
Tahitian Green or Midnight BIack?

-What do you think?
-You've been dropping hints aII week.

Mom stiII isn't buying you a car.

-I couId not have said it better myseIf.
-OIiver got a car when he turned 18 .

Yeah, but I couId back it out
of the driveway without hitting a tree.

I do remember you taking the paint off
your dad's Maserati.

-Hmm.
MOIRA: Thea, the party pIanner's waiting.

Sorry to run off Iike this.

But we have a convertibIe to go buy.

OLIVER: Good Iuck.
MOIRA: Yes.

-How's she hoIding up?
-Oh, she's okay.

Thea thinks she's actuaIIy
a IittIe bit too okay.

-What do you mean?
-Just...

...behaving erraticaIIy. Shut-in one minute,
run the company the next.

Her husband is missing
and presumed who-knows-what.

If anyone had an excuse to be erratic,
it's your mom.

That's what I toId Thea.

Department's got the same comment about
this heist as the other two. No comment.

S.C.P.D. may not be willing
to go on record...

...but traffic cameras got the entire heist
in this exclusive.

MAN: Shortly after 1 a.m.,
three masked robbers...

...approached the armored vehicle
after launching what appears....

TOMMY: That's why you keep
aII your money offshore.

MAN [ON TV]: One guard was
pronounced dead on the scene.

The other died en route
to Starling General.

Their identities have not yet
been released.

DIGGLE: With aII the guys up top,
you might want a side entrance...

-...for your, uh, Arrowcave.
OLIVER: Unh!

Just put one in. South aIIeyway.
Ah. There's something I wanna show you.

You're into onIine dating
and you need heIp with your profiIe.

Not exactIy.
But there's somebody I'd Iike to meet.

Yeah, I read about this.
Third truck to get hit this month.

I saw it on the news this morning.

CouIdn't figure out
why it seemed so famiIiar.

Then I remembered this. Kandahar, '09.

The Marines took out
a TaIiban transport vehicIe.

DIGGLE:
Yeah. WeII, there's a reason...

...why that Iooks simiIar. These guys run
the same technique. Where'd you find this?

Researching someone.
Bodyguard who works for a security firm.

BIackhawk Squad Protection Group.
His name is Ted Gaynor.

OIiver, Ted Gaynor was my commanding
officer in my first tour in Afghanistan.

Dig, I'm sorry...

...but Gaynor's on the Iist.

Gaynor's a few
hundred thousand doIIars short.

I never said it was just
1 percenters, did I?

This guy saved my Iife.
Received a commendation for it.

Don't care what your book says,
he's not a stick-up man.

-You haven't known him a Iong time.
-We both kept in contact...

...since we got stateside.

Six months ago,
he even offered me ajob at BIackhawk.

Trust me, you don't know this man
Iike I do.

I know in Afghanistan his training speciaIty
was M32 muItipIe grenade Iaunchers.

The exact same weapon used
in these heists.

Not exactIy something you find
at your IocaI sporting goods store.

Two months ago we found out
this wasn't even your father's book.

Written by whoever hired the other archer.
Doesn't that beg the question...

-...what eIse you couId be wrong about?
-I can be wrong. The Iist isn't.

Now, I'm gonna have a pointed
conversation with Mr. Gaynor tonight.

We'II see what he has to say.

I understand
if you wanna take the week off.

Yeah, weII, thank you.

Sir.

OLIVER:
WeII, hey, hey, hey.

I'm supposed to be transporting

-Hey, Tommy.

-Dad, I am reaIIy busy.
-Tommy, l know things have been...

...weII, strained between us since--

Since you cut me off

I was just trying
to joIt you into aduIthood.

And look at you now.
You've got your first job, heh.

My tough Iove worked.

What do you want, Dad?

Nothing more than to share a meaI
with my son.

Dinner, tomorrow night?

-LaureI and I have pIans.
MALCOLM: Bring her along.

I think it's time I got to know her
a IittIe better. Tommy...

...I've said some pretty hurtfuI things
and I regret them.

But you're stiII my son...

...and l still want
what l've always wanted.

For us to be cIose.

Let me check with LaureI
and I'II get back to you.

[DART GUN FIRING]


Ted, we're gonna have a conversation.

You make a move, go for a gun,
anything and things wiII end badIy for you.

[GUN COCKS]

Put the bow down.



It's aII cIear. You okay?

Uh, yeah.

WeII, I gotta taIk to my boss
but after what I just saw...

...I'd say you're as good as hired.

HeII of ajob interview, Ted.

UsuaIIy the vigiIante
onIy goes after rich schmucks.

Any reason why he wouId change
his MO for you?


You've known me a Iong time, John.
What do you think?


I think he made a mistake.

Got the wrong guy.

OLIVER:
I couId've shot you, kiIIed you.

-What the heII?
-Not gonna Iet you WiIIiam TeII...

-...an innocent man.
-Gaynor isn't innocent.

You seem to think that
because of your book...

-...which you trust more than you trust me.
-I trust my father.

And he expIained to me that every name
on that Iist has a reason to be there.

You took that book off your father's
dead body. How couId he be so chatty?

A few years ago, I found a message
he Ieft me expIaining the Iist.

How was that possibIe?
You were on a deserted isIand.

I didn't say that I found it on the isIand.

DiggIe, for the past four months,
I've Iied to...

...hurt and hid things
from aII the peopIe that I care about.

Do you reaIIy think that I wouId do aII this
if I wasn't sure?

OIiver, Iisten,
Gaynor got me into BIackhawk.

And I'm gonna prove he's innocent.

And if he's isn't?

[GUN COCKS]

You owe me that.

You owe me at Ieast that.

-Were you stationed by the perimeter?
OLIVER: Yes.

-And your report?
OLIVER: Everything's good, sir. No troubIe.

-How Iong have you been stationed here?
OLIVER: Uh, just arrived, sir.

Yes, you do seem rather green.

I don't recaII the submarine bringing
in a phaIanx of new troops IateIy.

OLIVER:
Submarine?

I thought everybody came in
to the isIand on the pIane.

Indeed they do.

I think you've tried on
every dress in the city.

Heh. TotaIIy worth it.


My friends are gonna freak.

Yes, weII, if your father were stiII aIive,
he'd freak too.

Though in an entireIy different way.

Heh, Iike when he saw what I was
wearing to my first boy-girI dance?

That poor boy you went with.
Oh, Robert scared him to death.

You know, Dad used to say his saddest
day wouId be when I turned 18 .

Now he's gone
and I'm the one that's sad.

[PHONE RINGS]

Ah, sorry.

I need to take this.

HeIIo?

Yes, I understand
but I'm with my daughter.

AII right. I'II be there.


We were gonna
spend the whoIe day together.

I know, but, uh...

...compIiance needs to fiIe
the 8K connected...

...to my assuming WaIter's position
at the company and they can't wait.

I'm sorry.

-Is everything okay? You Iook worried.
-Not worried. Just....

My father caIIed.

Oh.

-And how did that go?
-He invited us to dinner.

For tonight.

Oh.

Yeah. ApparentIy,
he wants to mend some fences.

But thanks to him, I can't afford a fence.

I assume he's got some other agenda.

WeII, there's onIy one way to find out.

And maybe he reaIIy is trying to extend
an oIive branch.

You reaIIy do Iook for the best in peopIe,
don't you?

Lucky for you.


I'm sorry to have to puII you away
from your famiIy.

What do you want, MaIcoIm?

We have a probIem with your friend,
CarI BaIIard.

He's trying to gentrify the GIades.

CarI knows that's not part of the pIan.

Which is why you're gonna shut him down.
You're his friend. He'II Iisten to you.

You want me to heIp you with CarI,
I want something in return.

Proof WaIter's stiII aIive.

My word isn't enough?

[MOIRA SCOFFS]

What's that saying? ''Trust, but verify''?

Words to Iive by.

GAYNOR: Two days Iater,
I'm stiII digging regurgitated tacos...

...out of the car vents and he asks me
why I won't turn on the AC?


AII right, you win.
Bodyguarding Queen was never that bad.

Six years serving, the onIy thing I'm
quaIified for is babysitting spoiIed brats.

Ted, they're not aII Iike that.

I haven't met one yet
that wouId survive a singIe day in-country.

Hmm.

Makes me wonder
what I was doing over there.

CARLY:
SpeciaIty of the house.

-Thank you, CarIy.
-Uh-uh, where is my cake?

Tired of Iistening to you compIain
about the cIeaners shrinking your suits.

-Oh, yeah.
-Heh.


-She Iikes you.
-She's my sister-in-Iaw, Ted.

Not anymore. Your brother's gone, John.

But you are here.

Car's waiting outside.

We got a cIient to drop off
at the art gaIIery opening.

GAYNOR:
You remember PauI Knox?

He was a coupIe of ranks under us
back in the 'Stan.

Good to be working with you.

I'II be outside.

Didn't know Knox
worked at BIackhawk.

They recruited him
when his tour ended Iast month.

Mm-hm.

PeopIe change, John.

And everyone deserves
a chance to prove it.

[TYPING ON KEYBOARD]

[COMPUTER BEEPS]

[DOOR OPENING]

OLIVER: Knocking is not just a suggestion.
-I need to taIk to you.

Thea, I'm not teIIing you
if Mom's getting you a car.

Heh, it's not about that.

Remember Iast week when I asked you
if you thought Mom was acting weird?

-Yep.
-WeII, I found out why.

She's hooking up with Tommy's dad.


-That's insane.
-I just saw them together.

-It's happening aII over again.
-What are you taIking about?

Um....

A coupIe months
before you and Dad Ieft on the Gambit...

-...Mom and Dad were arguing a Iot.
-About what?

I don't know. But she was having a Iot
of these Iunch meetings with Mr. MerIyn.

And now WaIter's gone too...

...and Mom and Mr. MerIyn
are back at it. It's gross.

Mom never wouId've cheated on Dad.
She's not cheating on WaIter.


You don't wanna beIieve because you have
this perfect image of Mom in your head.

That's not who she is, OIIie.
She's a Iiar and a cheater.

And you reaIIy don't know her at aII.

MaIcoIm and I, having an affair?

That it started when Dad was stiII aIive.

-Why wouId she think that?
-She says you and Dad were fighting.

-Oh, dear God.
-Mom?

-It's not your concern, sweetheart.
-Thea made it my concern.

What was going on?

Robert was unfaithfuI to me.
RepeatedIy.

It made our marriage difficuIt,
to say the Ieast.

I'm sorry. But your father wasn't aIways
the man you thought he was.


I know you thought he waIked on water.

But you see, that's how I wanted you
to remember him...

...as a good man who Ioved you.

That's how I want Thea to remember him.
So promise me you'II keep it a secret.

Of course.

-Mom?
-Yes?

Why wouId Thea think you and Mr. MeryIn
are stiII sneaking around?

WeII, I can't imagine.

Have you seen him IateIy?

OIiver.


He's been the CEO
of MerIyn GIobaI Group for years.

I've been running
Queen ConsoIidated mere weeks.

Yes, I occasionaIIy go

Is my interrogation over?

FYERS:
See, this is where we, uh...

...detain prisoners prone to running off
before I've finished with them.

[OLIVER GRUNTS]


[OLIVER COUGHS]


Prisoners Iike you, Mr. Queen.

At Christmas one year,
Tommy wanted a puppy.

He wanted to name it Arthur,
as in King Arthur...

...because he's a MerIyn.

Heh. WeII, you used to be
so incredibIy adorabIe.

-I stiII am.
-Heh.

My wife wouId've Iiked you, LaureI.

LAUREL:
I wish I wouId've known her.

She passed away
before Tommy and I became friends.

She was kiIIed.
There's no need to be poIite about it.

You are just a ray of sunshine today.

PIease forgive me.
TaIking about my wife has a tendency...

...to make me a IittIe bit maudIin.

And here I was beginning
to think my days of being...

...OIiver's geek were coming to an end.

-Is that your way of saying you missed me?
-No, but if that works for you, go with it.

Heh. A friend is running
a scavenger hunt...

...and there's a case
of Lafite RothschiId 1982...

-...waiting at the end.
-Oh, I Iove red wine.

But in order to find it,
I first need to get through this.

Hmm.

Security fob.

[DEVICE BEEPS]

[TYPING ON KEYBOARD]

It's PIN protected.

Response goes back to a company caIIed
BIackhawk Squad Protection Group.

My friend had his bodyguard
set it up for him.

PersonaIIy, I think it's cheating,
but whatever.

This is a miIitary-grade cryptographic
security protocoI.

-Your friend reaIIy went to aII this troubIe?
-The idIe rich are hard to entertain.

Listen, you get through it
and one of those bottIes of wine is yours.

This has been IoveIy, Mr. MerIyn.
Thank you.

Thank you forjoining me.

It's been wonderfuI
getting to know you better.

If Tommy doesn't mind me
mixing business with pIeasure...

...I couId use your signature on these.

You wanna shut down
Mom's free cIinic?

-It's not hers anymore, Tommy.
-That cIinic meant everything to Mom.

You were 8. I don't think you were in
a position to know what was important.

-I just need your signature--
TOMMY: Stop.

This dinner was never about
getting to know LaureI...

...it was about this.

You haven't changed
and you never wiII.

It's about time that I Iearn that
and stop Ietting you disappoint me.

We're Ieaving.

-This cIinic was his mother's.
MALCOLM: Yes.

And his mother taught him a Iesson...

...that the worId is a harsh
and unforgiving pIace.

When did she teach him that?

When she was Iying dead in the street
with a buIIet in her head.

Good night.

GAYNOR: Management keeps things
running smooth, which is nice.

Better than going to war
with the army you got, right?

Heh. Indeed. Indeed.

So, Ted, are you the reason
Knox is working for BIackhawk?

Look, I know you don't Iike the guy.

I wasn't his biggest fan either.

But jobs are hard to come by
for everybody these days.

And guys Iike us?

When aII anyone thinks you're quaIified for
is shooting at peopIe?

If I hadn't gotten Knox this job...

...chances are he'd be out knocking over
Iiquor stores or robbing banks.

[PHONE RINGING]

-What'd you get?
FELICITY: Your friend's bodyguard...

-...gave him the wrong fob.
-Why?

WeII, once I got past BIackhawk's
authentication system...

...there wasn't anything
about a scavenger hunt.

Just a directory and....

WeII, I think you've stumbIed onto
or gotten me to stumbIe onto...

-...something pretty iIIegaI.
-Define iIIegaI.

Oh, you know, robbing an armored car
with grenade Iaunchers and tear gas.

-What?
-Someone at BIackhawk...

...was using their system
to store scheduIes...

...for the city's
seven major armored car carriers.

IncIuding the three that have been hit. We
shouId provide this information to poIice.

They shouId be abIe
to predict the next heist.

HoId on, FeIicity.

I don't wanna get you in troubIe.
Do me a favor.

Forward that directory on to me

Looks Iike you were right.

If someone at BIackhawk is invoIved,
I'd put my money on Knox.

He started right before the heists began.
He has training.

Okay, I injured one of them.

He was bIeeding badIy

If any of Knox's bIood is in one

That's the way I was born, man.

-Happy birthday.

Now it's your turn to do as I asked.

MOIRA: I'II take care of it.
-Thank you, Moira.

-At my party. Right here in front of me?
-No, Thea, you don't understand.

WaIter hasn't been gone two months

-Just Iike you cheated on Dad--
-No, I never cheated--

-You wanna teII me how you did it?
-Not reaIIy sure.

-He didn't think you'd be very cooperative.
-Who?

Hey, John.

-Ted, you're part of this?
GAYNOR: No, not part of.

My men. My mission.

Mission?

-This isn't Afghanistan.
-Oh, don't I know that.

Over there, we were trusted with miIIions
of doIIars in weapons and personneI.

We were conquerors.

And now? We're nannies with Tasers.


So that gives you the right to steaI?

-To kiII innocent civiIians?
-I'm not gonna convince you I'm right.

-I am gonna convince you to join the team.

Yeah, he is reaIIy good

You never taIk about your mother.

I was onIy 8. I don't remember much

But after?

My father compIeteIy shut me out.

And then he went away.

He was gone for a year, maybe two.

l was 8 and he left me.
That is who my father is.

He only cares about himself.

-Cops give you a hard time?

I screwed up, OIiver.

ObviousIy Gaynor wasn't

I was wrong.

Yeah, but you were right too.

DiggIe, the truth is,
after what happened to me on the isIand...

...it's difficuIt for me to trust anything.

But you do.

And that reminded me

OFFICER: Thea Queen, you are under arrest

Do you know why my men

Because it masks everything

Whoever you fear...

...fear me more.

Okay, okay!

They caII him The Count.
That's aII I know.

I swear to God!

Hey! You get me down from here!

DIGGLE: Find what you're Iooking for?
-Took down three Vertigo pushers.

The Iast one finaIIy knew a name.
The Count.

The Count?
That's worse than The Hood.

-You're not going back out there?
-I'm not done for the night.

This Count has a Iot of bIood
on his hands.

-It is Iong past time he started paying.
-SIow down.

-I think you're missing the point here.
-What?

-Thea.
-Her hearing's in a few hours.

You think she cares more
about some drug Iord...

...or you being by her side
when she needs you the most?

-Hey, we shouId get going.
-Heh.

Judges don't appreciate the vaIue
of being fashionabIy Iate.


-Got any other tips?
-Ahh, Iet the Iawyer do aII the taIking.

They give you a pad and paper,
but do not pIay tic-tac-toe.


Judges don't appreciate that either.


Come on, Speedy.

I know. I know.

I keep on trying to get up and go...

...but, heh, I just don't.

I wish Dad were here.


I'm here.

We shouId Ieave now, Thea.

MAN 1
Miss Queen. Thea, over here.

Can we get a comment?
Just one comment.

Thea, are you going into rehab?

MAN 2:
Are you being expeIIed from BaIIioI Prep?

Are you worried about the outcome?

''Docket ending 1-10 -5-6,
People v. Thea Dearden Queen.

Possession of a controIIed substance.
Driving under the infIuence.''

CounseIors, I understand
you've reached a pIea agreement?

We have.
Given that my cIient is ajuveniIe...

...the peopIe have agreed
to probation.

AjuveniIe?

Says right here she's 18 .

LAWYER:
She is 18 now, but at her arrest...

...she was stiII two days shy
of her 18th birthday.

-Miss Queen has no priors.
JUDGE: Just because Miss Queen's famiIy...

...sweeps her priors under the rug,
doesn't mean they don't exist.

You get your cIient off.

You heIp your boss
avoid deaIing with a drug...

...that's sweeping across our city
Iike a pIague.

Everyone wins, except us...

-...peopIe of StarIing City.
LAWYER: With aII due respect--

Miss Queen...

...Iike it or not, you are now
the poster chiId for this menace.

Maybe if peopIe see
that the Queen famiIy...

...can't get away with using Vertigo...

...they'II think twice
before using it themseIves.

The pIea arrangement is denied.

This case wiII proceed to triaI.

[SPECTATORS MURMURING]

[CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING]

MOIRA:
They can't do this.

That man cannot send my daughter
to prison.

What are our options?

An interIocutory appeaI.

The triaI judges have discretion
to reject pIea agreements.

You might prepare
for the possibiIity...

...that this isn't gonna go our way.

I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.
I'II get to work on the appeaI.

[MOIRA SIGHS]

WeII, so much for the best
criminaI defense attorney in the city.

Thea, we wiII handIe this. I promise.

Like you promised WaIter
you'd aIways stay faithfuI to him?

-I feeI better aIready.
-That's enough.

Don't worry. Sounds Iike you won't have
to be putting up with me much Ionger.

What, does she not reaIize
how serious this is? She took drugs.

She drove.
She couId have kiIIed someone.

-Or herseIf.
-I know.

AII that judge is Iooking for
is someone to make an exampIe of.

Why does it have to be her?

Maybe it doesn't.

Listen, I have to go do something.

Are you gonna be okay?

I'm not the one facing prison.

Working for them now?

Why are you doing this to me?

I thought we were friends...

...or something.

Why'd you bother keeping me safe if
you were gonna hand me over to them?

Just get me out of here, okay?

I can't.

Hey. Don't Ieave me here.

I came back for you.

Now you hear me.

I came back for you!

Looking for a Detective HaII.
I was toId he works in Vice.

OIiver?

McKenna HaII.

Hi, heh.

Here I was, expecting a middIe-aged guy
in a bad suit.

And I got McKenna HaII.

-I Iive to surprise.
-Oh.

-I remember.
-Heh.

What was that cIub you got us
kicked out of? The CIub DeViIIe?

In my defense there was no sign that
said you had to keep your cIothes on.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

So a cop. I guess you're not hitting
the party circuit anymore.

I stiII go to raves.
I just go undercover now.

And I have to dress
sIightIy more appropriateIy...

-...to hide my badge and gun.
-Right.

So, what do you need with a vice cop?


-Vertigo.
-Right. I saw your sister on TV.

-I'm sorry.
-The judge is making an exampIe of her.

So if you couId find the person seIIing
drugs, it might take some heat off Thea.

Easier said than done.

Did some digging
and came up with a name.

Um, The Count?

We've known about The Count
for months.

Oh.

I wish this was thicker,
but we reaIIy don't have much on him.

Love to say we're gonna catch him
before your sister's triaI but it's unIikeIy.

Oh, I'm Iate for my shift.

WeII, if you hear of anything
about this guy, just Iet me know?

AIways Ioved how much you
cared about your sister...

...but Ieave the poIicing to the poIice.

Okay.

What did Queen want?

He's an oId friend.
His sister's jammed up.

-Anything eIse, sergeant?
-No.


[DOOR OPENS]


-You need a taiIor.
-You know about the Hood.

He just cornered me, man.

The Hood guy?

I didn't say anything.

Oh, I know.

You can't divuIge secrets
you don't know.


But exampIes must be made.


Vertigo...

...in its purest form.

When injected into the bIoodstream...

...affects the thaIamus region
of your brain...

...which is where aII of the information
from your pain receptors is coIIected.

No doubt you're in excruciating pain...

...but actuaIIy you're not.

You just think you are.

I've seen it Iast for days...

...untiI finaIIy the heart gives out.


One buIIet Ieft.


Now, you can use that buIIet to shoot me
and take your revenge...

...or you couId shoot yourseIf.


It's your choice.


[MAN SCREAMS]


The Hood...

...coming for me.

Interesting.

I'm Iearning
you're not a morning snuggIer.

I'm Iearning you don't Iike to wake up
at any hour that ends in a.m.

That's true. Yeah.

So if you're busy being a Iawyer aII day
and I'm managing a nightcIub aII night...

...when exactIy do we get
to see each other?

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

Hmm, I got it. Stay.

-Hey.
-Hey.

Hey, how is Thea hoIding up?

She's doing okay. Thank you.

Um....

ActuaIIy, uh, I came to taIk to LaureI.

Yeah.

-Hi.
-Hi.

Thank you for coming to court
yesterday.

Of course. But I don't think the judge
is wiIIing to move off his position.

Taking a hard Iine against criminaIs
is a pIatform for his reeIection.

I need you to taIk to your father.

He's inside the system...

...and maybe he cashes in a chip
with Judge Brackett...

-...gets him off throwing book at Thea.
-OIiver, I don't--

LaureI, I am working on something
on my end...

...but if it doesn't work out,
this is my best chance to heIp my sister.

PIease.

I'II see what I can do.

-But no promises.
-Thank you.

Yep.


LANCE: AbsoIuteIy not.
-Dad, I know how you feeI about OIiver.

Then why wouId you even ask me?

Because Thea,
she's onIy 18 years oId.

Which makes her an aduIt.
She can take medicine.

It's about time somebody
in the Queen famiIy did.

What about the Lance famiIy?

A young girI acting out,
engaging in reckIess behavior.

Does that sound famiIiar?

LaureI, don't go there.

Thea, she's just Iike I remember Sara.

That is not how I remember
your sister.

Because you remember her
the way you wish she had been...

...not the way that she actuaIIy was.

She's not the saint
you make her out to be.

I know she was arrested for shopIifting
and I know you made it go away.

WeII, maybe if I'd Iet her go to jaiI...

...Queen wouIdn't have had her
on that boat.

Dad, you make it sound
Iike he kidnapped her.

For so Iong, you and I have bIamed
OIiver for Sara's death.

But Sara's to bIame too.

When I Iook at Thea,
I see Sara's potentiaI in her.

And her fIaws too.

Yes, Thea made a mistake...

...but she's been through a Iot.

She Iost a father and a brother.

She doesn't need prison.

She needs heIp.

So pIease....

I'II make some caIIs.

[DOOR OPENS]

Seen a fair amount of CyriIIic
back in Afghanistan Ieft over by Soviets.

Is this Russian-owned?

It's the not-so-hidden headquarters
of StarIing City chapter of the Bratva.

DiggIe.

Whatever I say.

Whatever goes down.

Just go with it.

[IN RUSSIAN]

Good to see you too.

Long time.

ParticuIarIy for Bratva captain.

I was trying to figure out
where to put my interests.

I decided on pharmaceuticaIs.

I don't mean aspirin.

A wise choice.

Mephedrone wouId be
good investment for you.

It's the newest thing.

I was thinking Vertigo.

Newer thing.

Tough market, Vertigo.

-OnIy one seIIer.
OLIVER: I know.

Hoping you couId do me a favor,
arrange a meeting.

He is difficuIt man...

...and he does not Iike new friends.

This is everything the poIice
have on him.

TeII him it's a gift.


I wiII see what I can do...

...provided you do favor for me.

[IN RUSSIAN]

It is unusuaI for an American
to hoId such a position...

...of esteem in our organization,
Mr. Queen.

AnatoIi Knyazev...

-...he speaks very highIy of you.
OLIVER: He shouId.

I saved his Iife.

[MAN GROANING]

-What did he do?
-Something I toId him not to.

Now, the favor.

KiII this man for me...

...and I wiII beIieve your interest
in our organization is genuine.

And then I wiII arrange
a meeting with The Count.

DIGGLE: OIiver....
OLIVER: Hey, shut up.


Spasiba.

What are friends for?

I'm out of the gate now.
What's going on?

Are we getting out of here?

Where are you taking me?

[BOTH GRUNTING AND GROANING]

[CROWD CHEERING]

WeII, I admit that bout
was particuIarIy one-sided.

WouId anybody eIse Iike
to give it a try?

The point of these IittIe
gIadiatoriaI distractions...

...is to strengthen unit cohesion.

To that end,
I think our newest recruit...

...ought to be afforded
the opportunity to try his hand.

MAN 1 Come on.
MAN 2: Hurry up.

MAN 3: Get it on.
MAN 4: Get it over with.

I can't beIieve you just kiIIed that guy.

You reaIIy have a Iow opinion of me.

[TRUNK BEEPS]


Whoa, that's a neat trick.
You going to teach me that one day?


-No.
-What are you doing?

You need to arrange a new identity
for this guy. Get him out of the city.

So your Russki paI draws out The Count,
the vigiIante takes him down.

No, then the Bratva wouId know I used
them. That reIationship is too vaIuabIe.

I do the meet with The Count
as myseIf...

...Iet him Ieave,
then we foIIow him to his hideout.

-Just that easy, huh?
-I wiII stiII need my trusty bodyguard.

Fantastic. Looking forward to my new
and exciting career as a drug deaIer.

He is a captain.

And he has money.

-Are you interested?
-Hmm.

Let's say, yes.

My father was abIe to get Brackett
to back off his hard Iine stance.

Your father hates me.

-No.
-No.

My father hates him.

-Nobody asked you to get invoIved.
-I did.

LAUREL:
The judge has agreed to a sentence...

...of 500 hours of community service...

...and two years of probation.

ProvisionaI on the appointment
of someone to act in Ioco parentis.

In Ioco what?

It means the court
wiII appoint an individuaI...

...to assume responsibiIity for you.

Me.

I say thanks, but no thanks.

Thea,
you don't actuaIIy have a choice.

Oh, actuaIIy, I do.

See, I'm 18 now
and I can make my own decisions.

So I decide not to be
your ex-girIfriend's office monkey.

WeII, if you change your mind, then.

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

Thea.

You're in reaI troubIe. And rightIy so.

Doing drugs and driving,
it is beyond stupid.

That is a good deaI that LaureI got you.
Why aren't you jumping at it?

-I aIready have a mother.
-So....

You're gonna go to jaiI,
and it wiII ruin the rest of your Iife.

No, heh, I want to ruin Mom's Iife.

She's a Iiar and a cheat.
I mean, deaI with it, OIIie.

You can pretend aII you want to
that she's a saint, but I hate her.

-And she betrayed Dad.
-So you're gonna go to jaiI to spite her?


Thea...

...Mom didn't cheat on Dad.

He cheated on her.

Is that the best you can come up with?

Dad wasn't the man he said he was.

On the Queen's Gambit
right before he died...

...he admitted to me that he faiIed us.

You, me and Mom.

That he wasn't the man
he said he was...

...and that he just wished....


He wished he had more time
to right his wrongs.

-I don't beIieve you.
-Yes, you do.

-Speedy--
-Leave me aIone.

How dare you.

She was oId enough
to know the truth.

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

OIiver, the Russians caIIed.

The meet is set. It's tonight.

ALEXI:
You know why they caII him The Count?

When he was deveIoping this drug,
he experimented on the homeIess.

Prostitutes, runaways.

The poIice wouId find their bodies,
puncture marks on their neck...

...Iike a vampire.

You shouId not be in such a hurry
to meet this man.

Thank you for this.

But I'm not overIy concerned
about the S.C.P.D.

Now, I understand you gentIemen wish
to participate in the feeI-good business.

-Yes.
-And why is that?

I'm opening a nightcIub.
I'd Iike my customers to have a IittIe...


...something extra.

WeII, as it happens,
I'm Iooking to expand my brand.

A good wine's vaIue is measured
by its vintage.

The number of years
it took to ferment.

Vertigo is measured in Iives.

Fifty-six peopIe died
to perfect this high.

BeIieve me when I say
that they did not die for nothing.

[POLICE SIREN WAILING]

MAN 1 Let's get out of here.
Come on, come on, Iet's go.

-S.C.P.D. Put your weapons down!
MAN 2: Move, move.

OFFICER:
S.C.P.D. Freeze.

Get down!

OIiver!



No witnesses.

Get out of the car.


DIGGLE: You okay?
OLIVER: Keep it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got it, got it. Go. Steps, Iet's go.


[DIGGLE PANTING]


OIiver.

Drink.



[CROWD CHEERING]

[BOTH GRUNTING AND GROANING]

MAN 1 You're quick.
MAN 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

MAN 3: AII right.
MAN 4: Come on.



Morning.

How you feeIing?

I feeI Iike I'm getting over
the worst hangover of my Iife. Argh.

That coming from a guy who spent
most of his 20s in a hangover.

Think you can uncuff me?

I'm not gonna kiII you.

Promise.

Ah.

-Oh.
-You're standing. That's pretty impressive.


Count got you with haIf a dose but you
sweated out a smaII pooI coming down.

Ah, The Count.

Any chance our friends
in S.C.P.D. took him down?

None at aII.
But we did manage to get this.

I think we shouId anaIyze it.


Listen, maybe you need to give it
a few hours.

A near drug overdose isn't something
you just waIk away from.

Neither is Thea.

What's wrong?
Is everything okay with Thea?

This isn't about your sister,
this is about you.

Last night, we got a caII from a CI.

Busted up a drug saIe between
a bigtime deaIer and Russian mob.

''We''? I thought you worked Vice.

Joint task force.

-Vertigo's got everyone hoIding hands.
LANCE: Like I said...

...Iast night, drug deaI gone south.

An eyewitness puts you at the scene.

Whoever he is, he's mistaken.

-Yeah?
-I saw you, OIiver.

Is this true?

I was checking into The Count.

He's the guy who soId drugs to Thea.

Figured I couId find out what he Iooked
Iike, give your sketch artist something.

I paid a IowIife with a Russian accent an
obscene amount to arrange a meeting.

And did you get eyes on him?

No.

AII right. Are you pressing charges
against my son?


Get invoIved again,
you'II see the inside of a ceII.

UnIike Iast time, you
wiII not see the way out.

-Detective.
McKENNA: Thank you very much.

Thank you for what you did for Thea.

My daughter asked me for a favor
and I did it.

And that's the end of it.

-Hope you don't think I soId you out.
-No.

Just doing yourjob.

-What were you thinking?
-I was trying to heIp.

By running around with the Russian mob
and a murderous drug deaIer?

-Are you out of your mind?
-Heh, Mom, Iook...

...the reaI reason that you're upset is
because I toId Thea the truth about Dad.

-She never needed to know that.
THEA: Yes, I did.

I'm oId enough to know the truth,
Mom.

Mom....

It wasn't about your age.

It was about preserving your memory
of your father.

He Ioved you.

No matter his fauIts, he Ioved you.

I said that I wished...

...you had died instead of him,
but you stiII didn't say anything.

Why?

One day...

...I hope you're Iucky enough
to have a daughter...

...and you'II know why.

I'm so sorry for what I said.

I know, I know.

[BOTH SOBBING]

-Now what?
-Like you said, we anaIyze the Vertigo.

It's Iiquid form, it contains water.

So maybe we can trace back
to where in the city The Count is...

...cooking up this garbage.



DIGGLE:
OIiver? OIiver.


[IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

[ELEVATOR DINGS]

-Hey, we need to get you to a hospitaI.
-No.

OIiver, God knows what's in that drug.
It couId be causing permanent damage.

Ahem, FeIicity.
Hey, they said you'd be up here.

You Iook Iike something
the cat dragged in.

Not that there are cats
in this buiIding.

WeII, once a cat did get in,
but a guard Tased it.

It smeIIed Iike fur and static in here
for, Iike, a week.

Ahem, you mind stepping away
from the window?

I have a IittIe bit of a hangover.

Sounds Iike you need a BIoody Mary
and a pretzeI...

...not the IT Department.

ActuaIIy, my buddy Kevin
is starting an energy drink company.

He says it's fantastic
for curing hangovers...

...but I am very particuIar
about what it is I put in my body.

I've noticed.

I said, ''not noticed,'' right?


Trying to find a secret recipe.

CouId you do a spectro-anaIysis
of the sampIe...

...and find out exactIy
where in the city it's made?

If it's an energy drink,
why is it in a syringe?

I ran out of sports bottIes.

[ELEVATOR DINGS]

[ELEVATOR OPENS]

Your BS stories are getting worse.

WeII aware.

DIGGLE:
Looks Iike FeIicity came through.

The soIvent used in the Vertigo sampIe
was runoff water...

...originated within a 10 -bIock radius
of where East GIades meets the bay.

Nothing there except an oId detention
center abandoned about three years ago.

Cutbacks.

You can't go out there, OIiver.
StiII suffering the aftereffects of Vertigo.

Did you hear The Count?
He's taking this drug citywide.

We don't stop him,
this becomes an epidemic.

I can stop you from Ieaving.

Try.

DIGGLE:
OIiver, hit this and you can Ieave.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

I'm gIad you came to your senses.

You shouId remember one thing, Dig.

-What's that?
-I don't need the bow.

-My CI swears this is the pIace.
-Bring your men up on the fIank.

-Okay, this way.

Put down the needIe

-Put down the syringe.
OLIVER: He deserves this.

Not according to the Iaw.
PeopIe think you're a hero...

...peopIe Iike my daughter

You're no hero.

You're what I aIways said you were.

A kiIIer.

Get him.

Get me an ambuIance. Now.

Heh, since you Iost your Iicense,
I'II pick you up at 5.

Six.
We have a Iot of work for her to do.

WeII, then, Iet's say 7, just to be safe.

Is it too Iate to choose jaiI?

OLIVER & LAUREL:
Yes, ha-ha-ha.

I need you to go through these fiIes,
and puII out the documents...

...dated March 2007.

Do you think you couId do that?

I think I can, heh.

Look, I know I messed up.

I reaIIy appreciate this, LaureI.

We're gonna make an upstanding citizen
out of you yet, Speedy.


Thank you. This wiII be good for her
having a roIe modeI...

-...somebody better than me.
-Oh, you're not so bad.

And besides, it wiII be nice
to have her around.

[PHONE RINGING]

I gotta take this. Excuse me.

-HeIIo.
McKENNA [OVER PHONE]: l got the Count.

Bust up his Iab, got him on everything
from drug trafficking to homicide.

-He'll be gone for a long while.
-That's great. Thanks.

It was great seeing you, OIiver, heh.

You too.

[OVER PHONE]
See you.

-Argh.
-He's stiII criticaI.

I've never seen anyone OD
on this much Vertigo and Iive.

There's just no way of knowing
what damage has been done...

...to his brain and nervous system,
or if it's irreparabIe.

-Hi.
-Hi.

Thanks for meeting me.
I was nervous to come to your house, heh.

Okay, heh.

The thing is, I've been debating whether
or not to share this with you for weeks.

Can I trust you?

I'm not an idiot. You've dropped
some fairIy ridicuIous Iies on me...

...and yet I stiII feeI
Iike I can trust you, heh.


Why is that?

I have one of those faces.

[OLIVER CHUCKLES]

Sorry.

Yes.

You can trust me.

Then I have something to show you.

Have you ever seen this before?

No.

Where'd you get it?

From your stepfather.

It's from WaIter.

Uh....

Where did he get it?

He said he found it in your house...

...that it beIongs to your mother.

WaIter thought
she was hiding something.

Something more...

...and he wanted me to Iook into it,
but then he vanished.

I think this Iist
might have cost WaIter his Iife.

-Surprised to see me?

I imagine you wouId be,

There were contingencies

Yes, Vivian toId me. The head

[VANCH CLEARS THROAT]

I hope George has been
food shopping.

I'm famished.

So this book contains a Iist of the names
of the guys you've been hunting.

And this book, your mother's,
has the same Iist of names.

It's identicaI.

So where'd your mother get her copy,
OIiver?

For that matter, who gave it to you?

FeIicity Smoak. She said
that WaIter found it in their bedroom.

And now he's missing.

She's my mother. She's not
the kind of person who wouId--

Have her husband disappeared?

Because that's reaIIy the question.

I understand why you wouId beIieve
your mother over your stepfather...

...but I beIieve the innocent party
is whoever's missing...

...and presumed dead.

Twitch and I wiII open your throat.

-How many more are with you?
-What?

You have 10 seconds
to teII me something I beIieve...

...before I cut out your voice box.

Wait, wait, wait.
Yao Fei sent me here...

...and I'm pretty sure
it wasn't so you couId kiII me.

What?

Yao Fei.
He gave me directions to your...

...pIane.

Frank, you gotta be kidding me. You
can't throw me another assignment now.

It's ''Iieutenant,''
and that's what gives me the authority.

I'm drawing in on the Hood investigation.
I am gonna get this bastard.

Have you considered the possibiIity
no one wants you to?

-What?
-He saved the Christmas hostages...

...he took down an arsonist
and armored car thieves.

And busted the Vertigo drug ring
when we couIdn't.

What was urban Iegend
is becoming heroic.

If this man's a hero, I don't know
what my Iife in this city as a cop means.

Find meaning in foIIowing orders.

Frank, Iisten to me. I'm cIose.

If my Iead comes to something more--

Come to me with something reaI,
Quentin, and we'II taIk.

In the meantime,
I'm assigning you another case.

OLIVER:
Hey.

-Heading out?
-Mm, yes.

A meeting with the financiaI pIanners.

Are you aII right?

There was something that
I wanted to taIk to you about.

I wanna taIk to you about WaIter.

Right around Christmas,
when he disappeared...

...he gave me this.

This is your father's notebook.

He kept a Iist of aII the peopIe
in StarIing City who owed him favors.

I had no idea
there were so many of them.

I've been researching
some of those names onIine...

...and they're not good peopIe.

OIiver, I have no idea what your father
was invoIved in or with whom.

And you and your sister both now know
that he wasn't exactIy honest with me.

-Then we need to find out--
-No.

If what you say is true
and this Iist is fiIIed with bad peopIe...

...and WaIter was Iooking into it
and now he....

The onIy way to keep this famiIy safe...

...is for everyone in it
to stop asking questions.

IncIuding you, OIiver. Promise me.

THEA:
So this is reaIIy happening.

Four hundred and ninety-eight hours
of community service to go.

Four hundred and ninety-nine.
Orientation doesn't count.

TeII me how this is not crueI
and unusuaI punishment.

Anastasia, I'd Iike you to meet
our new intern, Thea Queen.

Interns get schooI credit.
I'm more Iike a court-ordered sIave.

I can reIate.

Anastasia is on a one-year
pro bono sabbaticaI from her Iaw firm.

And apparentIy
from my six-figure saIary.

The experience of heIping others
is its own reward.

I have yet to see evidence of that.
Speaking of Iack of evidence...

...Cyrus Vanch was reIeased
from Iron Heights.

We represent a victims' advocacy group
trying to keep Vanch Iocked up.

-I'm caIIing Kate Spencer.
ANASTASIA: I did.

She said there's nothing the DA's Office
can do without further evidence.

Then I'm going to her.

She aIso said
not to show up at her office.

Vanch is connected
to human trafficking, drug running...

...racketeering
and at Ieast 52 different homicides.

Okay. So, what's the pIay?

UnIess you have access
to some private poIice force...

...Vanch wiII stay free
to roam the streets.

[PHONE RINGING]

I have to get this.

-HeIIo?
-How does a night with me...

...and a dozen famous chefs sound?

Like an episode of The Bachelor.

I'm auditioning potentiaI chefs
for the cIub tomorrow night.

I've arranged a tasting and I couId use
an extra set of taste buds.

I'm trying to figure out how to get
a vicious criminaI back in jaiI. I can't.

-Perfect, it sounds Iike hungry work.
-Tomorrow night?

[OVER PHONE]
Maybe we could do it early?

Look, I gotta go.

-There's someone I have to caII.
-I'II see you Iater. Bye.

You don't find that convenient,
her happening to burn the book?

-She did it out of concern for my safety.
-Or her own.

You said it yourseIf.
Whoever compiIed that Iist...

...is invoIved in something dangerous,
and if your mother is Iying to you--

She didn't know any of the names.

She said she didn't.
You don't have to take her word for it.

If this were anybody eIse, you'd be on
your way to an arrow-side chat with them.

This isn't anybody eIse.
This is my mother. And I know her.

[PHONE BUZZING]

DIGGLE:
What's that?

That is the phone I gave to Lance
so he couId contact the Hood.

Is he asking you to turn yourseIf in?

He gave it to LaureI.

-HeIIo?
-I need your heIp.

ARROW:
That's why you have the phone.

Cyrus Vanch was reIeased from prison
on a technicaIity...

[OVER PHONE]
...living large in his lawyer's house.

There's no evidence of foul play...

...but I know he's Vanch's first victim
and he won't be his Iast.

-What about the poIice?
-They can't move on him...

...without evidence
of new criminaI activity.

OLIVER:
LaureI, obtaining evidence isn't what I do.

Vanch is dangerous.

HoId onto the phone. I'II caII.

LaureI needs my heIp.

OIiver, are you running to heIp her...

...or away from the truth
about your mother?

I have work to do.

KELTON: Hey, detective?
-I'm busy, KeIton.

-I'm sure you're gonna wanna hear this.
-Yup?

The bug I put in that phone
from the vigiIante just Iit up.

Your daughter's pIaying Maid Marian
to Robin Hood again.

-Where you going?
-Lieutenant Pike's office.

If she's meeting with the Hood...

...there's gonna be a task force there
when she does.

See, we gotta Iook at aII this
as an opportunity.

The Triad and the BertineIIi organization
are IeaderIess.

The giant sucking sound
you're hearing...

...is the current power vacuum
in StarIing City.

One that I pIan on fiIIing.

How are you going to convince
the Triad and BertineIIi's crew...

...that they shouId sign up with you?

WeII...

...that's an exceIIent question.

I need to do something.

[ON RECORDING] Something spectacular
to get their attention and earn their respect.

You know what I Iearned in prison?

If you want to be respected...

...you find the biggest guy
and put him down permanent.

I think I just found the biggest guy.

[POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]


This is gonna be fun.
I even wore my fat pants.

-I don't wanna know what those are, do I?
-Nope.

[PHONE BUZZING]


-This is work. It'II just be a second.
-Okay.

-HeIIo?
-It's me. I have something.

Can you meet?

Uh, yeah. Where?

Rooftop, Winick BuiIding, 30 minutes.

Good work, KeIton.

Okay, everybody.

Rubber buIIets. This is my daughter.
She cannot come to any harm.

But outside of that,
you do whatever needs doing...

...to bring that archer down.

MAN:
You got it, sir.

You sure about this?

I'd do anything to catch this bastard
and this is the onIy option I've got.

Look, I wanna get this guy
just as badIy as you do.

I just don't wanna see anything
come between you two.

I warned her. I said stay away
from this Iunatic, she didn't.

You don't think
that turns a knife in my back?

I hope she sees it that way.

Mm, put those puppy-dog eyes away.

-Something's come up at work.
-That can't wait untiI tomorrow?

It'II onIy be an hour.
I can meet you at the cIub.

One hour.

-An hour and a haIf, tops.
-Mm.

Ricky has been driving me
for six years now...

...and I can't remember the Iast time
he missed a day.

Thank you for offering to fiII in,
Mr. DiggIe.

It's my pIeasure, Mrs. Queen.
BeIieve me.

Are you sure my son won't miss you?

Said he was staying in for the evening.

And you beIieved him?

It's been my experience
when your son wants some aIone time...

...there's not much
I can do to stop him.

Much to my chagrin.

You can stop just up ahead.

No need to escort me inside.
I'm fine on my own, Mr. DiggIe.

Of course, Mrs. Queen.

MOIRA:
Were you surprised? You were? Ha, ha.

WOMAN:
Look who just came in.

MOIRA:
Mr. DiggIe.

Mrs. Queen,
I was just, uh, Iooking for the restroom.

Excuse me, Iadies. Happy birthday.

ARROW:
HeIIo, LaureI.

-Thank you for heIping.
-I couIdn't do much.

Vanch's position is too heaviIy fortified.
But I did get this.

Evidence he's trying
to take over the positions...

...vacated by Frank BertineIIi and--

[DOOR OPENS]

And the Triad.

What's wrong?

-We're not aIone.
-What?

S.C.P.D. Get down!

-Hands where we can see them!
-Dad.

Do it now!

You Ieave a bruise on her
and I wiII drag you down to heII myseIf.

LaureI, I'm sorry.

Quentin, don't!

[BOTH GRUNT]

LAUREL:
I don't know what's worse.

The fact that you Iied to me
or nearIy got me kiIIed.

You were compIeteIy safe.

I was on a rooftop with an army of men
pointing their guns in my face.

-You shouIdn't have been on that roof--
-No.

You wanted me on that roof.

Wasn't that the whoIe point
of your trap?

-I'm trying to catch a kiIIer.
-You manipuIated me.

ManipuIated?
You practicaIIy ran to this guy.

I toId you. I said stay away--

-Before you gave me the phone.
-What?

That's before you reaIized
you couId use me as bait.

-Your own daughter.
-But you wouIdn't Iisten to me.

You are so bIinded by hate
that you don't reaIize...

...the damage that it's doing
in your own Iife, to your famiIy.

So, what happens when you catch him?
What happens then, Dad?

You're gonna find another criminaI?

Somebody eIse to bIame
for Mom Ieaving?

For Sara dying? For your drinking?

-That's enough, LaureI.
-Yeah, you're damn right, it is.

LaureI.

The phone.

Give me the phone.

-LaureI couId've been hurt or worse.
-And I suppose that was Lance's fauIt.

What's your point, Dig?

Just that you don't see straight
when it comes to LaureI or your mother.

This is not the time
to bring this up again.

Okay.

Okay. But there's something I shouId
teII you and it's better now than Iater.

I'II be driving your mother around.

-You're spying on her?
-Just doing my due diIigence.

See if she meets with anyone
we might be interested in.

She's not a suspect. She's my mother.

Which is exactIy why someone needs
to take a cIose, objective Iook at her.

OIiver, something's going on in this city,
you know it.

That doesn't mean she's invoIved.

Then there's no harm in me driving her
around for a few days, is there?

I stiII can't beIieve it. He used me as bait.

-Who?
-My father.

He was trying to catch the vigiIante.

He eavesdropped on my phone
conversation and then Iied in wait.

-This was tonight?
-Yes.

WhiIe you were working?

This was work.

So you met up with the Hood guy?
KnowingIy?

He's contacted me before.

He heIped me with the DecIan case
and Joanna's arson investigation.

-The DecIan case was months ago.
-I know.

-Tommy, I've been wanting to teII you.
-LaureI, he's a murderer.

-You sound Iike my father.
-I hate to break it to you but he's right.

Are you seriousIy taking his side?

He's been Iying to me for weeks.

Yeah, it feeIs Iike crap, doesn't it?

Tommy.

MAN [ON TV]: A sting operation to catch
the notorious Starling City Vigilante...

...wreaked havoc last night...

...despite the police's failed attempt
to apprehend the vigilante.

Police have continued to insist
that their warnings remain.

This archer is to be considered
armed and dangerous.

Should you find yourself in harm's way,
as always, call 911 .

Interesting.

Using deception and intimidation
to make a name for himseIf.

Ha, ha. This guy stoIe my move.

I have news...

...from my friend
in the poIice department.

I think I've figured out a way
to get the Hood out and into the open.

Huh.

Astonish me.

Remember that attorney, LaureI Lance?

Hey, what's wrong with this picture?
You Iook Iike you're working.

Heh. I'm going over résumés
for the chef's position at the nightcIub.

This guy Iooks good.
He won Top Chef season six.

At this point, it is basicaIIy a cuIinary
prerequisite to be on that show.

Oh.

Can I taIk to you about something?

Tommy, every time you wanna taIk about
something and that something is LaureI...

...you Iook Iike you're about to teII me
you have a terminaI disease.

-She's been working with the Hood guy.
-What?

You're Ietting her work
with that person?

-She couId get hurt, Tommy.
-I'm not Ietting her do anything.

I onIy just found out about it...

...because she accidentaIIy sIipped up
on one of her many Iies.

Wait, she's Iying to you?
That doesn't sound Iike LaureI.

Lying, keeping secrets
about who she's with.

Does that remind you
of anybody we know?

Me, in every reIationship
that I've been in.

Me too. Except this one.

There's some sort of infatuation thing
going on here.

We both know that she has
a pretty strong track record...

...of being attracted to guys
who are dangerous, who break the ruIes.

Show me a more dangerous ruIe breaker
than the Hood.

You need to have
an honest chat with her.

Find out the reaI reason
she's keeping secrets.

I can't beIieve that LaureI,
of aII peopIe, wouId Iie to my face.

I guess that's the way that it is
with the peopIe that you're cIosest to.

I know.

But taIk to her anyway and fix this...

...before it becomes something
that's unfixabIe.

[SPEAKS CHINESE]

-It's Chinese. It means--
-''Survive.''

What do you think he meant,
besides not getting kiIIed?

There's an airfieId 10 cIicks from here.

It's key off this isIand.

Yao Fei and I had been observing it
for months...

...famiIiarizing ourseIves
with their operations.

We were supposed
to get off this isIand together.

But then Yao Fei was compromised,
and we were separated.

What's this for?

I think Yao Fei sent you here because he
knows I cannot take the airstrip aIone.

Sounds Iike Yao Fei.

He is a softerjudge of character
than I am.

If you're going to have my back...

...I need to know you can cover it.

What are you doing? Fight back.


Keep your bIade up.
AIways stay behind your sword.

You have no skiII, no strength,
no training.

To say you fight Iike a girI
wouId be a compIiment.

I toId you, I'm not a soIdier.
I was shipwrecked here.

I kiIIed the guy that was wearing
this uniform by accident.

Where was Yao Fei?

He toId me to run...

...and I did.

TOMMY [ON RECORDING]:
Hey, it's Tommy. Hit me on the beep.

Hey, it's me again.

PIease caII me back.

I think we shouId taIk.

[DOORBELL BUZZES]

I was just Ieaving you a message.

[LAUREL GASPS]

[ALL GRUNTING]

I Iove a girI
who can take care of herseIf.

[LAUREL GASPS THEN TASER BUZZES]

But can't bIock a Taser.

No need to get out of the car,
Mr. DiggIe.

It's just my accountant.
The onIy threat is boredom.

It's no probIem at aII, Mrs. Queen.
It's my job.

Yes. WeII, then, take the night off.
I'm quite aII right.

MOIRA:
What do you want?

[MOIRA CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]

MOIRA:
lt's taken care of. l've taken care of it.

CarI BaIIard
wiII not be a probIem anymore.

Given your propensity
for squeamishness...

...I'm assuming that
Mr. BaIIard remains in good heaIth.

I made it cIear to him, persuasiveIy,
that his pIans endanger the undertaking.

-I didn't have to make the usuaI threats.
-ExceIIent.

Now, one more matter to attend to.

I need you to have
the contents of this address...

...removed and disposed off
thoroughIy.

The warehouse where you're storing
the remains of the Queen's Gambit.

I aIready toId you,
I knew Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

And I don't think it serves for anyone
to find evidence of that.

[DOOR OPENS]

MAN:
What the heII are you doing?

Nothing. Just hanging.

I work for Mrs. Queen.

And I work security
for the man she's meeting with.

-Guess we're on the same team.
-I don't think so.

And I'm gonna need to see
what you put in your pocket.

-What are you, man, the poIice?
-Show it to me.

Do it now.

Right.

Just thought I couId come in here
and ruin my Iungs a IittIe bit.

I know it's a fiIthy habit.

LaureI, it's me. Can we taIk?

LaureI?

LaureI?


VANCH [ON RECORDING]: Make sure
this message finds its way to the vigilante.

Do it fast, because at sunrise
l'm gonna leave pieces of this girl...

...all over Starling City
unless he pays me a little visit.

You know, give us a chance
to get to know each other better.

What do we do? Can your CSIs...?

I don't know. Can they track this
or trace it or something?

-How did he know about LaureI?
-What?

How does this guy know
LaureI is connected to the Hood?

No idea.

I onIy found out about it myseIf
Iast night.

-She said you knew.
-WeII, just me and....

Mr. Lance, that maniac has got LaureI.

You've gotta caII in posse
or something.

-I don't know, SWAT teams.
-I can't.

Detective Lance.

I gotta go make a caII.

Thanks for coming. It didn't seem
Iike a good idea to taIk at your house.

WouId've been awkward
for you to expIain to my mother...

-...that you're spying on her.
-No, man.

-The awkward part's coming up.
-You bugged my mother?

Just Iisten.

MOIRA [ON RECORDING]:
lt's taken care of. l've taken care of it.

Carl Ballard
will not be a problem anymore.

MALCOLM:
Given your propensity for squeamishness...

...l'm assuming that Mr. Ballard remains
in good health.

MOIRA:
l made it clear to him, persuasively...

...that his plans endanger the undertaking.

l didn't have to make the usual threats.

MALCOLM:
Excellent.

Now, one more matter to attend to.

l need you to have the contents
of this address...

...removed and disposed off
thoroughly.

The warehouse where you're storing
the remains of the Queen's Gambit.

MOIRA:
l already told you...

...l knew Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

-I'm sorry, man.
-The yacht was sabotaged?

-Somebody tried to kiII my father.
-Your mother was invoIved somehow.

You do not know
that she was invoIved, DiggIe.

What I do know, OIiver,
and so do you...

...is that she kept this a secret.

Why wouId she do that
if she didn't have something to hide?

[PHONE BUZZING]

-Isn't that--?
-Yeah.

You have three seconds before I have
this Iine permanentIy disconnected.

It's LaureI. She's been kidnapped.

Listen, whoever this is,
he's gonna kiII my daughter.

PIease beIieve me.

Sorry.

It's nothing personaI.

The airstrip is
a very heaviIy fortified position.

I've been there.

-And I cannot take it on my own.
-So what?

Huh? You're just gonna kiII me?

-Ah.
-Like I said, it's nothing personaI.

If you're aIive, they wiII find you.
If they find you, they wiII torture you...

...untiI you give up my Iocation,
and I cannot aIIow for that to happen.

Hey, no, wait.
No, pIease don't do this.

I'm not gonna say anything to them.

Don't make it more difficuIt
upon yourseIf.

I can do this in a way
that you wiII not feeI it at aII.

[OLIVER GRUNTING]


[OLIVER SCREAMS]

[SLADE LAUGHING]

-SIade WiIson.
-OIiver Queen.

WeII, OIiver Queen...

...there might be a fighter
inside of you after aII.

Detective, if this is another trick,
you wiII not Iike the consequences.

I'm not particuIarIy happy right now.

I hate you.
I hate everything you stand for.

But this Iunatic has my IittIe girI.

He Ieft this behind
as some kind of ransom note.

His name is Cyrus Vanch.

Jeez.

-He'II kiII her if he doesn't get you.
-He'II kiII her anyway...

...so why come to me?

It's a pretty tight circIe that knows about
you and my daughter working together.

If Vanch knows it's because
someone at the precinct taIked.

-There isn't anybody eIse I can trust.
-Vanch is hoIed up in a mansion.

It's a heaviIy fortified position.
I was there. I can't take it by myseIf.

I need your heIp.

Then I need yours.

Time's running out
and stiII no visit from your friend.

I might have overestimated
his fondness for you.


AssauIt with intent and kidnapping.

You're gonna rot in prison
for Iife this time.


That's assuming
your hooded BFF saves you.

And his chances of survivaI
are not so great.

He's going up against trained men
with their fingers on the trigger...

...of guns that fire
up to 600 rounds per minute.

Now, I'm no Einstein,
but that is a Iot of buIIets.


[MAN YELLS]

And even if he were to take them out...

...I have two sharpshooters
on the roof.

And even if he were to get by them...

...what's he gonna do against the army of
sons of bitches I've got waiting for him?

Now, as I said, I'm no Einstein,
but I can count to 24.

In case you're wondering, I was,
so I studied up on my news footage...

...24 is the exact number of arrows
he carries in his quiver...

...and fIéchettes around his forearm.

[GUN COCKS]

[VANCH CHUCKLES]

Lose the bow, Merida.

VentiIate him.

My daughter. My IittIe girI!

ARROW:
I'm the vigiIante, you're the cop.

Doesn't mean I have to read
the bastard his rights, though.

LaureI, are you okay?

Yeah. Yeah.

I'm okay.

AII right, you're good to go.
I'II take you home now.

I can take a cab.

LaureI, you had a trauma.
I'II drive you home.

-No.
-What?

I'm gonna need you
to keep your distance for a whiIe.

-LaureI.
-Dad, I Iove you.

I'II aIways Iove you.

But what I can't do right now
is trust you.

I was doing my job.
I thought you'd understand at Ieast that.

That part I do understand.

But Iying to me, using me?

It's gonna take Ionger.

Are you aII right?

What wouId you think
if I said I didn't know?

That you were being honest.

My father has the phone now.

I don't think
he'II be giving it back soon.

Maybe that's good.

I didn't see
how it wouId put you in danger.

I'm a big girI.

-I knew the risks.
-Now I know them.

And I'm not wiIIing
to take them with you.

-What does that mean?
-It means goodbye.

TOMMY:
LaureI?

LaureI.

Oh, my God, LaureI.

-LaureI, teII me you are okay, pIease.
-No, no, I'm fine.

I'm so sorry.

No, no, it doesn't matter,
just as Iong as you're okay.

You know, this does not change
anything between you and I.

It takes two men to take the airfieId.

And if you compromise
my getting off this isIand, I wiII kiII you.

You've had your second chance.

You need me
just as much as I need you.


So, what's our next step?

Turning you into something
that won't get us both kiIIed.

Choose a weapon.

We're starting now?

That's mine.

You're the Iunatic who tortured me.

-No, that was another guy.
-BuII.

This mask, it's my operationaI
equivaIent to a baIacIava.

My partner and I wore them...

...to keep our identities cIassified
during our missions.

You're Iying.

Fyers toId me that this nutcase
is a prisoner on the isIand.

And Fyers is such
a trustworthy individuaI?

He Iied to you.

My partner and I came here to free
Yao Fei and get him off this isIand.

We're ASIS.

AustraIian InteIIigence.

Now, you're going to find
your siIver weapon.

Have you considered a sword?
I Iike swords.

MOIRA [ON RECORDING]:
l made it clear to him, persuasively...

...that his plans endanger the undertaking.

l didn't have to make the usual threats.

I've Iistened to this 15 times.

It's definiteIy her voice, DiggIe.
I just....

I can't beIieve it's her.

We aII have bIind spots
when it comes to famiIy.

Yeah. LaureI's aImost got her kiIIed.
Vanch never wouId've known...

...about her connection to me
if Lance hadn't Iied to her.

Guess the Iesson here
is bIind trust can be dangerous.

MOIRA:
l made it clear to him, persuasively...

...that his plans endanger the undertaking.

-l didn't have to make the usual threats.
MALCOLM: Excellent.

-What's the undertaking?
-I don't know.

But with aII this taIk about threats,
it can't be good.

You warned me that if she was Iying...

...it wouId be to cover up her
invoIvement in something dangerous.

I need to know
what the undertaking is.

What are you gonna do?

I need to have another chat
with my mom.

I'II need the Unidac merger finaIized
by the end of the week.

We're on something of a cIock here.

[MOIRA SCREAMS]

Moira Queen, you have faiIed this city.

[EngIish - US - SDH]

OLIVER:
My name is Oliver Queen.

For five years,
l was stranded on an island...

...with only one goal:

Survive.

Oliver Queen is alive.

OLIVER:
Now l will fulfill my father's dying wish:

To use the list of names he left me...

...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

To do this,
l must become someone else.

l must become something else.

NARRATOR:
Previously on Arrow:

SIade WiIson.
There's an airfieId 10 cIicks from here.

It's key off this isIand.
I think Yao Fei sent you...

...because he knows
I cannot take the airstrip aIone.

-You bugged my mother?
-Just Iisten.

MOIRA [ON RECORDING]:
l made it clear to him persuasively...

...that his plans
endangered the Undertaking.

-What are you gonna do?
-I need another chat with my mom.

MOIRA: I'II need the Unidac merger
finaIized by the end of the week.

We're on something of a cIock here.


[MOIRA GASPS]

Moira Queen, you have faiIed this city.

[MOIRA GASPS]

Stand stiII.

PIease don't kiII me.

Do you know anything
about your husband's disappearance?

-What?
-Is WaIter SteeIe stiII aIive?

I don't know where my husband is.
I swear.

Do you know anything about the Undertaking?

I said don't move!

I-- I'm a mother.

I have a son, OIiver. A daughter.
Her name is Thea.

She's just a teenager.
PIease don't take me from my chiIdren.

They've Iost their father.

They can't Iose me too.

PIease, whoever you are, pIease.

Okay.

I'm not gonna hurt you.


[CELL PHONE DIALING]

This is Moira Queen.
I'm on the 39th fIoor. I need heIp.

There's an intruder.

PIease.

[CAR ALARM CHIMES]

[ENGINE STARTS]

[GREEN ARROW GRUNTS
THEN FELICITY GASPS]

GREEN ARROW:
I'm not gonna hurt you, FeIicity.

How do you know my name?

Because you know my name.

Mr.--

OIiver. Oh. Wow.

Everything about you
just became so unbeIievabIy cIear.

-You're bIeeding.
-I don't need to be toId that.

-You need a hospitaI.
-My--

My father's oId factory in the GIades.

No, you need a doctor,
not a steeI worker.

FeIicity, you have to promise me
that you are gonna take me...

...to my father's factory
and nowhere eIse.

Yeah, promise.

Something teIIs me bIoodstains
are not covered under my Iease.

MAN [ON TV]: So far,
the police are unwilling to comment...

...but unsubstantiated
eyewitness reports claim...

...the Starling City vigilante
attacked Mrs. Queen...

...in her office earlier tonight.
She was unharmed in the assault.

FELICITY:
Excuse me.

Can you heIp me? He's reaIIy heavy.

Oh, damn it. He just missed a carotid.

It's a zone two wound. Press there.

-I shouId've taken him to a hospitaI.
DIGGLE: No.

That's why he asked you
to bring him here.

He knew the poIice wouId wanna know
how and why he got that wound.

I'm guessing ''how'' and ''why''
are OIiver Queen's Ieast favorite questions.

Yeah, weII, there's aIso ''when'' and ''where,''
he's not too fond of.

-If we can't bring him to the hospitaI--
-We are bringing the hospitaI to him.

-Is that--?
DIGGLE: Yeah.

His bIood. He stored it for a rainy day.
And I say right now, it's pouring.

FELICITY: Mm.
DIGGLE: I got it. Over there.

Do you know what you're doing?

Yeah, I had some medicaI training
in the Army.

I just hope it's enough.

Remember pIaying Operation
when you were a kid?

Yes. Heh.

-It never made me want to throw up.
-Hey, FeIicity, Iisten. Trust me.

He'II be fine.
He's been through a Iot worse than this.


SLADE:
Dead.


How did you survive here
for six months?

I know GirI Scouts
who have more fight in them.

Fighting GirI Scouts now, SIade, huh?

Aah!

-What the heII?
-Listen, kid.

We have 10 days
untiI the suppIy pIane Iands.

Ten days to turn you
into at Ieast haIf a soIdier.

So start taking it seriousIy.


Aah! What is the point of this?

These soIdiers don't carry bamboo!
They have guns!

So, what am I supposed to do
if one of them jams a gun in my face, huh?

Threaten them with my stick?

Jam this in my face.

Do it.


I give up. I give up.

There is no giving up to these guys!

No crying or buying your way
out of it!

You have two choices.

Escape or die.

So choose.

Escape.

Then Iet me show you how not to die.

[OLIVER GRUNTS]

Lian Yu.

It's the name of the isIand, I know.

It's Mandarin for ''purgatory.''

It is? WonderfuI.

Is that the airstrip?

ASIS took sateIIite images
of the whoIe isIand.

This is Fyers' main camp,
where I was heId for aImost a year.

Do you think that's where Yao Fei is now?

We can get a message to him.

-TeII him we found a way off the isIand.
-Forget about him.

This is the airstrip.

And these infrared images show...

...there are at Ieast 10 soIdiers
guarding the perimeter.

-Too many of them for you?
-No.

My probIem is the guy here
in the tower.

It's a PATC.
A portabIe air traffic controI tower.

The U.S. government set up these
for disaster zones...

...Iike ThaiIand after the tsunami.

So, what's the probIem?

The gIass is buIIetproof.

I can't take out the tower guard
with my sniper rifIe.

And if he suspects anything's wrong,
he'II radio Fyers and we're canceIIed.

It'II be up to you to take him out.

Up cIose and personaI.

Are you ready for that?

Do you think I'm ready?

What I think is there is onIy one
suppIy pIane every three months.

We Ieave tomorrow,
or we die soon afterwards.

I pick Ieaving.

So get some sIeep.

We Ieave at 0600.

Don't worry. You'II be back
with your girIfriend soon enough.

Morning.

PIease don't hate me.

Why wouId I hate you?

For cheating on you with Sara.

Did it hurt, OIIie?

-Did what hurt?
-When they kiIIed you.


SLADE:
Rise and shine.

Come on.

We're moving out.

AII cIear.

Hey, can we, uh...?

Can we rest for a second?

You can rest on the pIane.

Yeah, weII, reaIIy Iooking forward
to that in-fIight movie.


-Oh, God.
-Don't move.

Is it a mine?

-Yeah.
-The soIdiers mined the isIand?

No. It's probabIy Japanese.
Left over from WorId War II.

StiII active. Impressive.

Can you disarm it?

Without disarming you?

[MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

SoIdiers.

OLIVER:
They're gonna see us.

They're going to see you.

Wait. Stop.

SOLDIER:
What are you doing so far from camp?

OLIVER:
I got separated from my unit.

SOLDIER:
Come with us.

OLIVER:
I can't.

I'm kind of having a bad day,
you know?

[SLADE YELLING]


Be stiII.

Thanks.


Yao Fei. Come in. Sit.

Now, the first time I saw you
with this contraption...

...I thought you Iooked
utterIy ridicuIous.

That is, untiI you took out
three of my best men with it.

Twenty-five compound bows...

...wiII be arriving
on tomorrow's suppIy pIane.

I'd Iike you to train a few of my men
on how to use them.

Archery can take years to master.

I trust you wiII be
a proficient instructor.

That wiII be aII.

I hope you are steadfast in your
commitment to our cause, Yao Fei.

For her sake.

I am.

-ObviousIy you were never a Boy Scout.
-Yeah? What tipped you off?

We better hurry.

The woIves come out at night.

There are woIves here?

Right. Of course there are.

Because what wouId the worst pIace
on Earth be without woIves?

WeII, the onIy thing
that wiII keep them out is fire.

WeII, you know,
you're weIcome to heIp.

SeriousIy?

I've been working on this
for two hours.

I know, I was watching.

Thank you for the entertainment.

You're gonna wear that thing out
just by Iooking at it.

Don't worry.

She'II be waiting for fIowers
when you get back.

I doubt it.

Remember how I toId you
I was shipwrecked here?

Her sister was with me
when the boat went down.

That's funny.
I never took you as being the bad boy.

You seem to Iack the spine.

That's why I've gotta get home.

To make this right.

Do you think you can sIeep
with your girIfriend's sister...

...and stiII make it right?
You're dumber than I thought.

And beIieve me when I teII you,
that is saying something.

Yeah, weII, you don't reaIIy strike me as
the type of guy who accepts apoIogies, so....

Everybody is in this Iife
for themseIves.

Learn that at AustraIian spy schooI?

No.

I Iearned that here.

Do you remember I toId you
that I had a partner?

Yeah.

You remember the guy
who tortured you?


That--? That freak show
was your partner?

-His name's BiIIy Wintergreen.
-Oh, okay.

Our mission was to exfiItrate Yao Fei...

...find out why Fyers and his men
were interested in him.

Our bird got shot out of the sky
before we even saw the airstrip.

That's where I found you.

When Fyers took us prisoner,
he asked if we wouId join him and his men.

BiIIy accepted Fyers' invitation...

...and I decIined.

He was the godfather to my son, Joe...

...and yet he turned his back on me
without even thinking twice about it.

Everybody is in this Iife
for themseIves.

If you Iet him radio camp, we're done.

-What about the others?
-You worry about your one.

I'II worry about my 10 .

[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]


FELICITY:
Good job.

I think.

His heart rate's eIevated,
but at Ieast the bIeeding's stopped.

Thanks for your heIp.

You kept your head on.

WeII, I aIways wondered
how I'd react...

...if I found my boss shot and bIeeding
inside my car.

Not that I heIped
because he's my boss.

I'd heIp anyone who was shot
and bIeeding in my car.

I was thinking aII of this
wouId be more of a shock.

-You saying you caIIed this aII aIong?
-I'm not saying anything.

Except OIiver brought me a Iaptop
with buIIet hoIes...

...had me trace a bIack arrow...

...and research a company
invoIved in armored car heists.

I may be bIond, but I'm not that bIond.

Yeah, OIiver's not too great
with cover stories.

FELICITY:
Neither are you.

The two of you with that whoIe
energy drink hangover cure?

PIease.

What was reaIIy in that viaI anyway?

Vertigo.

I knew it.
I didn't know it was Vertigo for sure...

...but I knew it wasn't something
that can cure a hangover.

Yeah, we needed it anaIyzed
so we couId take down the Count.

-That was you and OIiver?
-And you, FeIicity.

Without you, we never wouId've found him.

But why come to me?

Hard as it probabIy is for him to admit,
even OIiver needs heIp sometimes.



[GUN CLICKS]

Damn.

[OLIVER GRUNTING]


-What's happening?
-There's a syringe IabeIed Ativan.

It shouId stop the seizure. Go.

[EKG FLATLINING]

His heart stopped.

FELICITY:
I'm caIIing 911 .

No. Wait, you can't.

-You know how to use one of those?
-We are about to find out.

[DEFIBRILLATOR BEEPS]

You didn't say cIear.

[DEFIBRILLATOR WHINES]

I heard the charge. That's good news.

-How's that?
-Might not be the machine.

It couId be the wiring.

Come on, come on, come on.

FELICITY:
Try again.

DIGGLE:
CIear.


[DIGGLE SIGHS]

What the heII did you do?

I've been buiIding computers
since I was 7.

Wires are wires.

What do we do now?

Pray we don't have a heart attack
ourseIves.

[GUARD GRUNTING]

One job to do
and you manage to screw up even that.

I'm gonna make sure
everything is cIear.

Stay here. Keep the door Iocked.
Do not Iet anybody in except for me.

-You got that?
-Yeah.

SLADE:
Here. Keep this.

And try not to shoot yourseIf
by mistake.

[LINE CRACKLES THEN DIAL TONE]


[LINE RINGING]

LAUREL [OVER PHONE]:
Hello?

HeIIo?

ls anybody there?

Have you Iost your mind?
They might be monitoring the caIIs.

MAN [OVER RADIO]:
lsland Tower.

This is Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

We are 700 kilometers
southeast of your position.

ETA, three hours, 22 minutes, over.

IsIand Tower, Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot,
acknowIedged.

Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot, acknowIedged.

MAN: Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the Earth....

OLIVER: What is that?
SLADE: It's a chaIIenge code.

They're trying to verify our identity.

Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot, pIease repeat.

MAN: Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the Earth....

-Wait.
SLADE: What?

Wait, I know this.

I know this.

They picked the one book
that I read in coIIege.

-What the heII are you taIking about?
-It's a quote from The Odyssey.

Uh....

Of aII creatures that breathe
and move upon the Earth, nothing--

Nothing is born
that is weaker than man.

Are you sure about this?

If you're wrong,
this pIane wiII turn around.

OLIVER:
Yes. I'm positive.

Nothing is born
that is weaker than man.

Say it.

Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
It's-- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Bred.

Not born. Bred.

Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

That's it.

Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

MAN:
Roger that. See you in a few hours. Out.

-The Odyssey?
-Yeah. It's a--

WeII, it's a story about a guy
who's trying to get home, so....

WeII, after a few days
at LandstuhI Air Base...

...you'II be on your way home.

You sound Iike
you're not coming with me.

I'II be coming with you.

After I radio in an air strike
on this Iocation.

I'm going to send Fyers and aII his men
straight back to heII.

Wait.

You can't bIow up the isIand.

Yao Fei is stiII out there.

-He is not my concern.
OLIVER: ReaIIy?

He's the onIy reason you came here.
Rescuing him was your mission.

The mission has changed.

Edward Fyers is a mercenary
and he is not on this isIand by mistake.

He has pIans for Lian Yu
that invoIve Yao Fei.

And whatever they are,
they must end.

Yao Fei saved my Iife.

That is your debt to repay, not mine.

Where are you going?

AII my Iife...

...aII that I've ever thought about
is myseIf.

I took my famiIy for granted.

I betrayed peopIe that I Ioved.

And I'm not gonna be that person
anymore.

I can't Ieave Yao Fei here to die.

I won't.

The pIane Ieaves in three hours.

If you and your friend are not on it,
I am going to Ieave without you.

If I don't make it back in time...

...and you get out of here...

...I want you to caII my famiIy.

CaII my famiIy.

Sure, kid.

[EKG FLATLINING]

-He's going into cardiac arrest again.
-No.

Ah, the Ieads just came Ioose.

[EKG STOPS]

DIGGLE:
Aah!

It's Iess stressfuI
when he's jumping off rooftops.

Yeah.

This bow has put arrows
in quite a few peopIe.

Yeah, bad peopIe.

That doesn't bother you?

Because--

And I mean this in a good way.

--you seem Iike the kind of guy
it wouId bother.

When I was in Afghanistan,
my unit was tasked...

...with protecting this IocaI warIord.

GhoIem Qadir.

Qadir was Iess than human.
He soId opium.

SoId chiIdren.

One day, we were accompanying him
to MosuI...

...when my convoy was ambushed
by insurgents.

We had them outgunned.
Firefight didn't Iast more than a minute.

When the smoke cIeared...

...I moved in on their position.

They were aII dead.
I knew which one I had kiIIed.

When I puIIed off his keffiyeh, I couId
see it was just a kid, no more than 18 .

Shot him in the throat.

I kiIIed this kid
to protect this human piece of garbage...

...and I thought, ''Am I stiII good?

Am I stiII a good man?''

Doing this with OIiver...

...doing what we do, I feeI good again
for the first time in a Iong time.

And that's worth
aII the coIIateraI damage?

Haven't kiIIed anyone,
if that's what you're asking.

But he has.

UnfortunateIy,
there are aIways casuaIties...

...when you're fighting a war.

-How did you--?
-Let's go. I'II expIain on the way.

-Stupid. You shouId not have come back.
-I found SIade WiIson.

And he has a way off the isIand.

-But we have to go right now.
-No.

-No.
-What? What do you mean, no?

This is our chance. What reason couId you
possibIy have for staying here?

Not what.

Who.

Now, Mr. Queen, I think it's past time
you Ieft this isIand.

PermanentIy.

MAN [OVER RADIO]:
lsland Tower, this is Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

We are 5000 feet and holding. Over.

Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot,
this is IsIand Tower.

You are cIear to Iand.

MAN:
Roger that.

SimpIy to satisfy my own curiosity,
why aren't you aIready dead?

-I saw Yao Fei choke you to death.
-I guess he's not as strong as he Iooks.

[SOLDIERS LAUGHING]

StiII, you returned for him.

So you're either a fooI...

...or is it possibIe
you now think yourseIf a hero?

-I'm not a hero.
FYERS: No, of course not.

It's not possibIe to be a hero
when there's nobody worthy of saving.

Is this what you want?

-You want me to fight him again?
FYERS: Oh, no, Mr. Queen.

I'm sorry, you're mistaken.

This is not a match.

It's an execution.

YAO FEI:
I'm sorry.

It's Wintergreen, right?

BiII Wintergreen?

I know aII about you.

I know you worked
for the AustraIian government...

...and that you used to fight
for your country.

You used to stand for something.

Whatever he's paying you, I'II tripIe it.

-How many of them are there?
SOLDIER: Go, go, go!

[SOLDIERS YELLING]

DEATHSTROKE:
SIade. Come back to die?


Was it so easy to betray me, BiIIy?

WeII, BiIIy...

...you aIways had a good kick.

[KNIFE SQUELCHES]


[GUNSHOT THEN SLADE GRUNTS]

-Come on, come on, come on.
-Aah!

[SOLDIER GRUNTS]

[AIRPLANE MOTOR HUMMING]

SLADE:
There goes our ride.


I'm impressed.

-You didn't puke.
-I swaIIowed it.

You can untie me now.

Why did you want me to tie you up
in the first pIace?

A man in pain is unreIiabIe.

I was afraid I might kiII you.

Thanks.


What?

I'm trapped on an isIand...

...and my onIy friend is named WiIson, so....

What now?

We hope my fireworks show
set Fyers back...

...maybe enough for those
who hired him to caII things off.

Hired him?

WeII, Fyers is a merc.
He foIIows the money.

So he's on this isIand
under someone's empIoy.

And what do we do?

We have to make sure that neither
of us dies on this godforsaken isIand.

I thought you said
if we didn't get on the pIane...

...we weren't gonna make it.

WeII, that dumb kid that I trained...

...he wouId never have made it.

You?

You might just have a chance.

Yup, it's Fyers.

MAN [OVER PHONE]: Satellites show multiple
heat blooms on the island. What's happening?

There was a compIication.

MAN: Slade Wilson?
-I'm handIing it.

MAN: Handle it better.
l've worked too hard and planned for too long...

...to have complications
close to the end.

I assure you, it won't happen again.

MAN: What of Yao Fei?
-I've ensured his cooperation.

MAN:
Good.

l've paid you a lot of money, Fyers.
l expect a return on my investment.

You sent for me?

I'm a man of my word.

You made the right caII,
turning in your young castaway.

And for that,
I'II grant you five minutes.

Shado?

Shado? Shado?

SHADO [IN MANDARIN]:

YAO FEI [IN MANDARIN]:

Shh, shh, shh.

I guess I didn't die.

Again.

CooI.

It's not bad.

So how am I gonna expIain this one?

Hickey gone wrong?

The poIice coIIected a sampIe
of your bIood at Queen ConsoIidated.

I just hacked the crime Iab
and ordered the sampIe destroyed.

Oops. Heh.

I hope it's aII right.
Your system Iooked Iike it was from the '80s...

...and not the good part of the '80s,
Iike Madonna and, weII, Iegwarmers.

It's a Iot of work.

Does that mean you're in?

You mean ''in''
as in I'm going to join your crusade?

You're practicaIIy an honorary member
of the team aIready.

Hm, so Mr. DiggIe said.

-No.
-Then why'd you upgrade my system?

First, because seeing a network
that poorIy set up hurts me in my souI.

DIGGLE: Ahem.
-And second...

...I want to find WaIter.

My stepfather.

He was nice to me.

And Mr. DiggIe toId me
the notebook you use...

...to fight crime is the same notebook
that got WaIter abducted.

I'II heIp you rescue him, but that's it.

Then I want to go back
to my boring Iife of being an IT girI.

That's my offer.

Okay.

So I've been meaning to ask...

...is there a bathroom?
Because I've had to pee since I got here.

-It's upstairs to the Ieft.
FELICITY: Great.

FeIicity.

Thank you.

Yeah.

OIiver,
I know you don't wanna hurt this girI...

...and you didn't have any choice
in teIIing her who you were...

...but we're asking her to get invoIved
in dangerous stuff.

-We can protect her.
-How?

Your motherjust shot you, OIiver.
You can't even keep yourseIf safe.

She was scared.
She was defending herseIf.

Or she was hiding something.

Like maybe her invoIvement
in WaIter's disappearance or worse.

DiggIe, we don't aIways know
why peopIe do what they do.

But what I do know
is when I was standing in her office...

...with an arrow aimed at her heart...

...she begged me to spare her,
aII on behaIf of me and Thea.

Now, I've taken down a Iot
of bad peopIe.

-None of them brought up their kids.
-She had the Iist.

Now, she may not be in charge
of whatever it is...

-...but she's definiteIy invoIved.
-InvoIved in what?

We don't even know what it is.

And untiI we do, she is off Iimits.

Am I cIear?

DIGGLE: But, OIiver, are you saying this
because you truIy beIieve she's innocent...

...or because you don't wanna face the fact
that your mother might be guiIty?

MOIRA:
Six-one and a deep voice. I--

Hey. What's going on?

Where have you been?
I've been caIIing aII night.

At the cIub.
I get zero reception in there.

-It's time you invest in a IandIine.
-Thea.

Your mother was attacked Iast night.

-By the vigiIante.
-What?

He came after me at the office.

-Did he hurt you? Are you okay?
-She hurt him.

She shot him point-bIank
with a gun hidden in her office.

That shouId heIp with your investigation.
You get any evidence? A bIood sampIe...?

There was a screw-up at the Iab.

That's too bad.

Mm.

We'II be in touch.

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

-Oh, sweetheart. I was so scared.
OLIVER: I'm just gIad you're okay.

I thought he was gonna kiII me.

I promise you...

...he's never gonna bother you again.

[EngIish - US - SDH]

OLIVER:
My name is Oliver Queen.

For five years, l was stranded on an island
with only one goal:

Survive.

Oliver Queen is alive.

OLIVER:
Now l will fulfill my father's dying wish...

...to use the list of names he left me...

...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

To do this, l must become someone else.

l must become something else.

NARRATOR:
Previously on Arrow:

Looking for Detective HaII.
I was toId he works in Vice.

-OIiver?
-McKenna HaII.

I Iive to surprise.

-I want to find WaIter.
-My stepfather.

I'II heIp you rescue him, but that's it.

That's my offer.

Okay.

Jerry.

Jerry, you okay?

-You Iook a IittIe piqued, man.
-I'm fine, it's, uh....

Ms. HiII wants us to move the Sherwood
into the vauIt.

Now? It's midday.

I know. She says it's a security threat.

It's aII the robberies IateIy. Heh.

[ALARM BLARING]

That way.

[GUARDS CHATTERING]

Take this thing off me, aII right?
I got it Iike you asked. Here.

Take it off me.

Were you--? Were you bIuffing?
WouId that thing have detonated?

VioIentIy. Don't worry, though.

You did exactIy as I asked,
so it's just unconsciousness for you.

Unconscious?

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES
& JERRY GROANS]

Might wanna take it easy if you pIan
on taking someone off that Iist.

This is me taking it easy.

So who's the unIucky guy tonight?

OLIVER:
Ken WiIIiams.

His pyramid scheme stoIe miIIions.

PeopIe didn't just Iose their homes,
their Iives were ruined.

Why don't you caII it in earIy?
I'm not expecting much troubIe.

FeIicity. Did you just--?

Computer-override your Iock?
Maybe a IittIe.

-What are you doing?
-I puIIed up information on Mr. WiIIiams.

Did you know he's a widowed father
of a 10 -year-oId boy?

I toId you, I'm onIy in this to heIp WaIter,
not to be an accessory to orphaning IittIe kids.

I'm giving him a warning.

Has it occurred to you
you couId do some good in the city?

Beyond recovering peopIe's
stock portfoIios and saving accounts.

You're not the onIy one who knows
how to reboot my system.

I made a mistake.

-Getting in my way? I don't disagree.
FELICITY: No.

Signing on with you. Even provisionaIIy.

[SLADE GASPING]

Hey. Hey. Drink.

Tastes Iike dirt.

You gotta stay hydrated, okay?

Hydration is not my probIem.

My probIem is getting a buIIet
dug out of my arm with a duII bIade.

Let me take a Iook.

-Oh. Ugh.
-Is it infected?

Go figure.

Yeah. Uh....

I gotta stop that before it spreads.

SLADE: When you swing past the drugstore
for those antibiotics...

...you wanna get me a copy of Maxim
or maybe a Sports lllustrated?

Yao Fei had these super herbs back
in the cave that wouId heaI anything.

AII right?

I'm gonna go get them.

You're not gonna Iast an hour out there.

WeII, I guess you better hope
I get back in 45 minutes, then.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

MOIRA:
Oh. Thank you for coming.

It is so good to see you, Frank. Mm.

-It's been far too Iong.
-Yes.

My interests in China
have kept me away more than I'd Iike.

But with the Undertaking approaching,
I feIt a return to StarIing City was in order.

ActuaIIy, Frank, it's the Undertaking
that I wanted to taIk to you about.

I wanna get out.

Is this because of
what happened to WaIter?

With WaIter. With Robert.

Last week, the vigiIante
nearIy made my chiIdren orphans.

I've reached my Iimit, Frank.

FRANK:
That's, uh...

...a Iot to confide in me, Moira.

Robert did.

I know he reached out to you,
whether I was supposed to know it or not.

He had misgivings.

He sought you out
because he knew you did too.

But then he was murdered.

And that shouId be a cautionary taIe
for both of us.

Yes, I know. And I've gone aIong with this
for as Iong as I can stomach it.

We started this to fix the GIades, Frank.

To cure the city, not Iay it to waste.

You got into this because of
what happened to your daughter.

Frank...

...what wouId Amanda want you to do?

WeII, maybe we shouId come back Iater.

No, maybe we shouId wait.
This is reaIIy serious.

What if her next attack of conscience
Ieads her to the poIice?

No, she won't say anything.

I had to make the same caIcuIation
when you found out about me.

Mm-hm. What wouId you have done
if you were wrong...

...and I decided to make a caII
to Detective Lance?

I wouId've put an arrow in you.

[DIGGLE CHUCKLES]

ReaIIy? You reaIIy wouId have done that?
ReaIIy?

Hmm. I had a bet going with myseIf
on how quickIy you wouId visit...

...teII me not to reveaI your secret.
Looks Iike I won.

ActuaIIy, I was hoping that
I couId get you to change your mind.

[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV]

I was worked up on adrenaIine Iast night,
and I didn't exactIy put my best foot forward.

I was hoping you'd give me the opportunity
to do that now.

How about you start with Ken WiIIiams?

Did he aIso enjoy your adrenaIine
Iast night?

No. He returned the money he stoIe
in time to put his son to bed.

Like I said, FeIicity, just a warning.

McKENNA [ON TV]: We'd like to remind the
public we are coordinating efforts with lnterpol...

...as the Dodger operates
primarily in Europe.

They have advised us to warn the public
he is considered armed and extremely--

I heard about this guy.
They caII him the Dodger...

...because he avoids getting his hands dirty.
He uses hostages to do his steaIing for him.

-How?
-Puts a bomb coIIar around their necks.

Last year, a guy in Madrid didn't steaI what
the Dodger toId him to. It took his head off.

-LiteraIIy.
FELICITY: Now this psycho's in StarIing City?

Too bad his name's
not in your notebook.

Not aII peopIe that I target are on the Iist.
Every once in a whiIe, I make an exception.

Hostage-taking jeweI thief, for exampIe.

So why don't you heIp us take him down?

He's Iate.

Never.

I maintain a Swiss account
for financiaI transactions.

Here's the number.

Thanks.

I'II wire you the money.

Assuming I don't mispIace the numbers.

My bookkeeping method is a IittIe sIoppy.

ReaIIy? Heh.

CIearIy, you're under the impression that
you can have the Sherwood ruby for a steaI.

WeII, you're new here in town.

We're not as refined in StarIing City.

I am getting that impression.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

[DODGER CLEARS THROAT]

DODGER:
Don't worry...

...your men are mereIy unconscious.

In about 17 minutes, they'II wake up with the
abiIity to teII every other fence in this town...

...that I am not to be trifIed with.


What about me?

Uh....


What about you, indeed.

So to catch this guy we need to either figure
out where he is or where he's gonna be.

This reaIIy how you guys figure out how to
get your target? Over burgers and shakes?

Sorry it took me so Iong. I'm waiting on
a bunch of particuIarIy rowdy customers.

[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]

You need me to handIe that?

I appreciate it, but I'm a pro by now.

I'II be here if you need me.

GirIfriend?

No, no, that's my sister-in-Iaw.

-Sort of.
-CarIy was married to Dig's brother.

And he passed away.

-WeII, Iooks Iike she's hot for you.
-Ah. Can we get back to crime-fighting?

ActuaIIy, I was thinking
you probabIy shouId ask her out.

-ReaIIy?
OLIVER: Mm-hm.

I'II do that five minutes
after you ask out McKenna.

Ooh, the detective on the Dodger case.
You have a thing for her?

-Uh--
DIGGLE: Yes.

[OVER SPEAKERS]
This is way too hard

I don't see you asking CarIy out.

FeIicity, this guy,
he's targeting a very specific type ofjeweI.

We figure out why...

...and that'II give us the how to catch him.

-I have an idea.
OLIVER: Mm-hm.

Your crush object with a badge said
they were working with InterpoI.

-Yeah.
FELICITY: Why don't I work up a IittIe tech...

...you distract her with a IittIe fIirty-fIirt,
sIip said tech onto her phone...

...it'II turn it into a microtransmitter and,
boom, we'II Iearn everything she knows.

Hmm.

-It's not how I typicaIIy get my information.
-How do you typicaIIy do it?

I find the person and then I put
the fear of God into them untiI they taIk.

But we can try your way.

You know, CarIy, I don't want this to, um....

You know, to come off weird or anything,
it's just....

l never wanted to stop
Because l don't wanna start all over

WouId you Iike to have dinner?

How about tonight?

-Tonight?
CARLY: What...

...we haven't waited Iong enough?

All that l want
All that l want

Mm. Who knew street meat
couId taste so good?

I had a feeIing you needed a break
from the office.

Hank was my first cIient.

I kept his son from being sent away
for a mugging that he didn't commit.

Then how did that not score you
free hot dogs for Iife?

CNRI gives Iow-income peopIe
access to the IegaI system.

Without them,
his son couId have gone to prison forever.

I couId've gone to prison too.

He couIdn't afford a dream team
of super-Iawyers.

So I'm supposed to feeI guiIty because
I'm Iucky enough to have a rich famiIy?

No.

You are Iucky.

And hopefuIIy, CNRI wiII show you that.

Hey!

[HORN HONKS]

Give us the purse
and we won't press any charges.

Yeah, you're right.

I reaIIy do feeI Iucky.

LAUREL:
This got snagged as he vauIted over the fence.

Looks Iike a chain from his waIIet.

-I thought you gave up crime-fighting.
-What?

WeII, the business with your sister.
I figured...

-Oh.
-...you'd stay out of poIice precincts.


Yeah, I-- I saw you on the news
and reaIized that I never thanked you...

...for everything that you did, so....

Thank you.

So you got promoted.

-Major Crimes.
OLIVER: Wow.

And they assigned me to the Dodger case.

He extorts peopIe into steaIing for him.

-How's that going?
-SIow.

It was nice seeing you
the Iast time that I saw you.

Yeah. It was good seeing you too.

It was Iike oId times.

Except the PG version.

-How do you mean?
McKENNA: Ha, ha.

WeII, you and I aIways knew
how to have a fun time.

Something that's been
missing from my Iife.

So how about a drink?

Not now.

WouId you maybe--? I'II take you for a--

WouId you Iike to have dinner with me,
McKenna?

McKENNA: Ha, ha.
-I was on a deserted isIand for five years...

...and I am totaIIy out of practice
with this whoIe--

Mm. WeII, dinner wouId be nice.

In fact, I can make myseIf free tonight.

-Yeah.
-Great.

So I'II grab you at 8?

That's perfect.

-Okay.
McKENNA: Okay.

-I'm Iingering. I'm gonna go.
-Ha, ha. Okay.

[MAN COUGHS]

Who's there?

HeIp me.

[PHONE DIALING ON RECORDING]

[LINE RINGING ON RECORDING]

LANCE [ON RECORDING]: Lance.
McKENNA [ON RECORDING]: lt's Detective Hall.

l have an update on the Dodger case.

A body was found at an art gallery
shot point-blank.

There were three other men,
all rendered unconscious...

...by a highly focused electric current.

LANCE:
Same MO as that guard at the museum.

You got an lD on the vic?

McKENNA:
His name is Cass Derenick.

Pause.

Who's Cass Derenick?

FELICITY:
Arrest, possession of stoIen goods.

Arrest, conspiracy.

Conviction, attempted saIe of stoIen goods.

This guy's a fence. The Dodger's Iooking
to unIoad the Sherwood ruby.

Which means he'II be in the market
for a new fence.

One he hasn't, you know, kiIIed.

So we find the fence
and we find the Dodger.

Anyway, I saw onIine
that you seII a chain waIIet...

...with an eight baII on the chain.

I was wondering if you couId give me
a name of one of your customers...

...if I gave you a description.

Yeah, sure, you can caII me back.

You and every other used-cIothing
and Ieather-goods store I've caIIed today.

What was that about?

-What's up with the fancy-fancy?
-What--? Oh, um.... Heh.

I have a date. Contrary to popuIar opinion,
I do have a Iife.

Then why do you seem so nervous?

Is it obvious?

Just be your charming and brooding seIf.

I mean, girIs seem to dig that.

This girI's different.

She knew me before the isIand,
before I was--

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

It's CNRI. I've gotta take this. I'm working
on a very important purse-snatching case.

Yeah.

HeIIo?

Yeah, he might have been wearing
a red hoodie.

Kind of Abercrombie-Iooking.

His face, not the hoodie.

ReaIIy?
You wouIdn't happen to have his name?

[ON STEREO]
You had to sell your gold

Thank you so much.

[LINE RINGS]

Hey, LaureI.
Does your dad stiII, Iike, arrest peopIe?

I found the dirtbag.

His name is Roy Harper.

CARLY:
I can't remember the Iast time I was here.

It's so beautifuI.

Yeah, this was the pIace
to take a girI in high schooI.

Hmm, I was never Iucky enough
to experience that.

I had braces and terribIe bangs back then.


I'm sure you Iooked amazing.

I'm gIad we finaIIy got around to doing this.

Me too.

You know, Andy set a pretty high bar
when it came to first dates.

Hmm.

He faced down armed gunmen for a Iiving...

...but I've never seen him as scared
as he was before that first date with you.


CarIy, I'm sorry,
that wasn't good first-date etiquette, was it?

To bring up Andy
when we are having a romantic night?

-ProbabIy not.
-CarIy, this is difficuIt and compIicated.

It's not Iike there's a manuaI, you know?

You know, for a moment...

...I feIt Iike a girI who Iikes a boy
and nothing eIse mattered.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

If this is too hard for you
or too compIicated...

...then pIease, you know, just get out now
because I've aIready been hurt too much.

-I'm sorry--
-Can you just pIease take me home?

[OVER SPEAKERS]
ln these little moments

Get your cards out

l am waiting

Mm. No, no, no, it is not possibIe
for something to be this good.

-Right?
McKENNA: Oh.

-You must have missed souffIés.
-What do you mean?

Five years on an isIand
away from civiIization.

What did you do? What did you eat?

-Where'd you sIeep? How did you make it?
-McKenna.

Sorry.

-Didn't mean to driII you.
-It's okay.

I haven't had a conversation
with a guy in a whiIe...

...without it resuIting in
me reading him his rights.

Heh. So....

Yeah, but those years,
they must have changed you.

[ARROW PIERCES FLESH

From the guy I used to party with
to who you are now.

Yeah.

I had to make some tough choices.

HeIp me.

You're right.

It changed me.

l am waiting

-What kind of tough choices?
-I don't wanna taIk about those experiences.

ln these little moments

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

Saved by the ceII.

HaII. Ahem.

Okay, put what the CI toId you
in the warrant appIication. I'II be right there.

It's work. I gotta go.

Okay.

FeIicity, Iisten. I need you to activate
the bug in McKenna's phone.

I think the poIice just
got a Iead on the Dodger.

Okay.

Who are you?

My name's AIan Durand.
I'm an exchange student.

I was on a fishing excursion with my cIass.

We got Iost and our boat caught fire.

It was some mechanic maIfunction.
We had to jump ship.

-When?
-Two days ago.

It was awfuI. I thought I was gonna die.


Where are the other students?
Where's the boat's crew? Huh?

I think I'm the onIy one who made it.

I managed to get to shore.
I thought I was Iucky.

What? Somebody found you?
SoIdiers or--

Yes!

Yes. They had these masks on.

They attacked me and beat me!
They Ieft me here!

Who are they?

You can untie me at any point, by the way.

DODGER: Nice pIace you have here.
ABBOTT: Thank you.

TeII me, does every fence
in this town hire muscIe?

Heh. I did as soon as I heard
about what you did to Cass Derenick.

Ah, yes, Cass. God rest his souI.

He wasn't a very nice man.

-He tried to steaI from me.
-Oh.

I've heard that you have
a better sense ofjudgment.

And that you'd have no troubIe
in moving this.

WeII, it's onIy a recession
for some peopIe.

I take a 15 percent commission
off the top.

Let's caII it 12 , shaII we?

I don't have to remind you
what happened to the Iast person...

...who tried to screw me over.

S.C.P.D. Grab the fIoor!



[ABBOTT GRUNTS]

-Come quietIy.
-I'm afraid I'II have to decIine.

Then I'm afraid
you won't be going to jaiI.

[COLLAR BEEPING]

I heard on the news the Dodger got away.

HopefuIIy the night
wasn't a compIete waste.

Your dates. How'd they go?

-Great.
-Awesome.

You two suck at Iying.

The poIice and I busted it up
before the Dodger couId get himseIf paid.

-Don't change the subject.
-Is your hacker chip stiII working?

You two are no fun.

Yeah. StiII getting a strong signaI.

OLIVER:
You shouId puII up the poIice records.

-Everything the Dodger's stoIen so far.
-What're you thinking?

We know the Dodger has a taste
for a very specific type of antiquity.

Yeah. These aII Iook Iike
they're from the ominous decade.

The Iast ten years
of King Ferdinand's reign.

-And she says we have no Iives.
OLIVER: Are there any other pIaces...

...that seII or dispIay items
from the ominous thing?

Decade. Not reaIIy.

PeopIe in StarIing City

OLIVER:
StarIing City Cancer Society.

It says they're hoIding
a fundraising auction tomorrow.

-We couId Iure him out into the open.
-With what, a fake?

No. The Dodger has a trained eye
for this sort of thing.

He's not gonna faII for anything
Iess than the genuine articIe.

Where are we gonna get
a rare Spanish antiquity?

You reaIIy have no idea
how rich his famiIy is, do you?

-Norris Cemetery.

-Sorry to hear that.
-You and an army of bookies.

-[OVER SPEAKER] Can l go?
LANCE: No.

You've been lD'd as a suspect

Quite a résumé you've compiIed here.

Petty theft, B and E, robbery, petty theft.

StoIen car. It's nice to change things up
once in a whiIe.

And petty theft.
You got something against banks?

WeII, it is hard to run
with one under your arm.

WeII, maybe you'II Iearn
a few new skiIIs in prison.

Look, I don't wanna steaI, okay?
I don't have any other choice.

My mother, she has a probIem.

Yeah, her son's a moron.

No.

Vertigo.

She got hooked on Vertigo last year.

She kicked it,
but I guess she'd done enough that...

...it messed her up.

Hmm.

She hasn't been the same.

And her medicaI biIIs-- Look, I'm just trying
to heIp her get out from under.

Look, we're not priviIeged enough
to have as much as other peopIe, okay?

Fine.

Let him go. It's just a damn purse, right?

They'II meet with you.
It has been arranged.

Thank you for this. There's one more thing
I need you to do for me.

MaIcoIm's the onIy one who knows
where WaIter's being kept.

I just need a cIue.

Some Iead to foIIow.

If our pIan works,

Your bait's attracted them, at Ieast.

That's not exactIy who I'm Iooking to catch.

So I'm getting a good signaI
from the GPS I put in your famiIy's brooch.

I can track it on my phone.

Speaking of, have you given any thought
to what might happen if this doesn't work...

...and the Dodger absconds
with your famiIy jeweIs?

I'm sorry, that came out very wrong.

Let's just keep our eyes open, FeIicity.

DIGGLE:
Hey, isn't that...?

Mm-hm.

I wouId rather take my chances
with a deadIy jeweI thief.

DIGGLE:
Right.

Hey, that brooch was donated
by the Queen famiIy.

If you want it,
you're gonna have to bid.

ActuaIIy, Iove, I thought I'd just take it.

I shouId see if
the security guard's having probIems.

Good idea.
I'm gonna go check on the bait.

I think I have a probIem.

Get away from me.
If this thing bIows--

That's not gonna happen.

The Dodger said if I caIIed the poIice, he'd--
I'm gonna get decapitated, aren't I?

AII right, tracker's on the move.
If I find him, I can get him to disarm it.

-TaIk me in. Stay caIm.
-Too Iate.

You can go. Just go, go, go.

...the GIades in the middIe of the night.

You must not know
the vaIue of a vintage purse.


Don't worry, it's aII there, except for these.

-That's a reaIIy fiIthy habit you got there.
-Yeah. TeII me about it.

Hey, can I give you some advice?

First, stay out of the GIades.

And second?

Don't faII for every sob story
a guy Iike me teIIs the poIice.

You have a great evening, now.

Do you ever take time off?

I do.

In fact, Iast night, I went on a date.

The guy was kind of ajerk.

ReaIIy?

He might've had a reason.

McKenna, I didn't just Iose
five years on the isIand.

I Iost the part of me
that enjoyed being aIive.

Listening to music and, uh...

...eating a souffIé with a beautifuI girI.

It's the easy things.

But when you asked me about the isIand,
it reminded me of aII the hard things.

And the hard choices that I had to make
that stiII stay with me.

Made me question how I can trust...

...and even if I'm worthy of being
with anyone.

You are.

[BOTH CHUCKLE]

Can I take you to a dinner
that I promise not to cut short?

Um....

-Throw in a souffIé and you're on.
LANCE: McKenna.

I'm gIad you're stiII here. Queen.

-Mr. Lance.
McKENNA: I was just Ieaving.

Is everything okay, sir?

Yeah. I'd Iike you to work with me
on the vigiIante investigation.

Yes, sir. WeII, don't worry.
We'II bring him in--

Oh, yeah.

[McKENNA CHUCKLES]

-Uh, ready to go?
-Yep.

McKENNA:
Okay.

Tastes Iike an ashtray,
but does the job.

I owe you one.

You didn't get into any troubIe
out there, did you?

Hmm?

No. Not a bit.

Frank Chen recommended you.

He said you couId heIp us
with our probIem.

He appreciates you agreeing
to meet with me.

Anything for a friend.

So how can we be of assistance?

MaIcoIm MerIyn.

I want you to kiII him for me.

[EngIish - US - SDH]


OLIVER: So, Maureen,
how are the dance Iessons coming?

Not bad. It's aIways so kind of you
to remember, Mr. Queen.

Oh, that is compIeteIy seIfish of me.

I'm aIways Iooking for somebody
to tango with.

MAUREEN: WeII, here you go.
Just caII when you're done.

WiII do.

So aII this is your cash?

In this bank.

-What am I supposed to do with this?
-FiII it.

Okay.
