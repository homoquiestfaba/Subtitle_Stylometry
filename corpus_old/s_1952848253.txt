(A sort of Australian chanting or hymns)

Josh ?

Wow!, your old man let you come up for air?
Ohh, You're kidding, right?

Ohh, you're gonna be in a shit!.

Ahh, Fuck it! I wanted to be here.

So your geek, she is?!
Yeah,  reinforcements

Hey babe,  come meet Josh.
Frank McGuire's boy.

Josh McGuire?!.
Heard all about you

So cool, your dad brings you on these expeditions.

Yeah... yeah, I am just stucked.

How are Things at forward base?

They still haven't found a way through.
Everyone is tired, getting pissed off for Dad .

Just the usual , really...

As soon as I leave, the whole thing turns into
a Mongolian clusterfuck. ( gone to hell)


So, Carl says you're a climber.
I've done a little ...

Yes, she's strong like bull
and smart like tractor.

No!, original ...

Hey ,Eddie, I'll take lightly.
Josh, jump upfront.

Oh, sweet!

(A sort of Australian chanting or Hymns)

The last prime Eden of wilderness

We go down out here,
Even god won't know where we are

Some mud man
will be using our skulls for a soup bowl

That wasn't in the brochure, honey.
Yeah, well ... they live at large now baby.


I have control.

Ahhhh, Why do we cave, Josh?

Well,  I do not...... momentarily.

No, wrong answer.

Why do you cave, Carl?

Because ...

Let me show you.

(A sort of Australian chanting or Hymns)

Espiritu Esa-ala.
The mother of all caves .

My god,  Carl .... that It's ...
Yeah,  It's

Focus on the cave!
Focus on the cave!

Height  taken...

kill you in flush.....

XXX you gotta expend your might ... XXX

Low oxygen.

Oh, bloody Josh

let me help you in the boil, George!

Hey Judes , I want this free dive check, please?!
Now


All good, Frank?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Hey J.D. you changed your bathroom, come over
here and give Judes a hand with the gear, will you?.

Yah ...

George, did we hear from Josh yet?

-lu(Luko ), base form me.
-Nah, no, Not yet.

Check it out!.

Where's Liz?
She Still decompressing.

Coms(communication lines) up yet ?
Coms are good

How was the dive, J.D. ?

Good visibility.
Yeah?

Yeah? it's a bit cold.

Hang out, can you give a hand with the
rebreather, my legs are stuffed...

(George turns on music)

You are getting old!
Huh

(song is playing in the background)

Off you go Virgil.

(indistinguishable chatter between Judes and J.D)

Lean forward for me a bit.
That's it.

That's the third time
you check that gauge.

George ... I'm fine.

Been a while
since you saw daylight ?!

17 days.

Anyone can call the dive
at any time for any reason, yab?!!!

You all set?

Sure ...

So what else new, Luko ...?!!!

Carl! You're back!

(Speaking native)

(are you smoking?!!!)
(you may kill us all..)(kaboom)

Why is that gear coming up?

Well, there a big storm building
right of the coast

Frank said to pull out
whatever gear we are not using

Ohhh, he did!!
did he ?!

Hey Jim, this cave
not gonna beat me

(Workers singing)

You're in the dog ass, kid

Yeah, whatever ...
It's probably, dad didn't even noticed I was gone.

When He and Judes had to
climb to Camp 3 for those bail out tanks

You were suppose to bring down ...
He noticed

Oh, Shit!
Yab. suck to be you.

Bail out?
Ah.... Emergency tanks.

See the divers' rebreathers

But if something goes wrong,
we need backup.

What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?

-Look at her, she is tizzy.
No, She goes.

Here. I can feel it.

No. Virgil scanned that whole section
There's bughole

Machine can not feel the cave, George.

Well ... Obi Wan
Taken you find a way through

You best do it fast.

Two days, three at most,
This whole place will be flooded like a blood tunnel.

I hope this will give us plenty warning

You guys from the National Geographic, right?
Yeah, ... good to see you.

Victoria, are you gonna meet this guy?!.

Hey Dex, I hope you're awake bro,
you've got a visitor.

Hey man!

Josh, man, you are in the shit.
Yeah. Thanks ...

Ah this is Victoria, she is new
so give her the grand tour.

Hey...!
ahhh...!

For you, only one dollar.

Esa-ala Cave .

The largest unexplored cave system in the world.

A million years of Rainwater dissolving
it's way down  through the rock

Trying to find its way to the sea

Which is of course  why we're here.

For no other reason than to explore
and find that hidden pathway

Wow ... That's incredible.
How far in they got?

Oh ..... A tour for the lady is it ...

of hand carried and elite ton of equipment,

Almost two vertical kilometers into the earth crust
Over a period of  five weeks.

Wow... Now I know what Carl
has been spending his cash on.

Yab, kicks of billionaires.

That's so cool!

It's pretty..... basic, I... I haven't finished yet,
But you get the general idea.

But Dex, you've been working on this for five years.

Four years yeah, four ...
I mean the 3Ds is a bit of problem that all of it.

Well it, obviously it hasn't rendered properly yet,
and the connection speed up here is just a fractious ...

Ala That's not a wizard.

And finally, here we are,
Forward base.

And somewhere under there,
She goes...

You need to talk to Judes.
perhaps, her on the dive !.

You kidding me, Now?
I'll just telling you what I see. she's tired.

rain?
No ..no , we're good a few days yet.

Let Frank on.
yab, I'll just get him.

Carl !.

Ah...We're saved! Thank God!

Frank, how are you doing, buddy?

Nice of you to drop by, Carl.

(Hah ha).....You know some little bird told me
You are shutting up "Shop".

It would be nice of you
to ask the boss.

You must have found a way through, Huh?!!!

Wait, and You can ask me
after the dive!.

Yeah.... don't pull that soft to shit on me, Frank
We are running out of time here

Exactly, and  Some of us have been holding
equipment down here for weeks

While you pace out to back to America
to bring up your girlfriend.

You know, that's pullshit on so many levels
I not even gonna address

I've given you every piece of equipment
you asked for

Spared no expense.

I guess the cave doesn't understand that , Carl.

Frank!

You know what? check this out ...

Perfidio ...

And I am gonna hold this sucker down
2000 vertical meters, just to give you a shot,

Cause your ass is so tight, when you fart....

Only dogs can hear it.

(giggles and guffaws )
Yeah!   - Yeah!

(a cheesy  grin )

All right ... Can you put Josh on?

Josh, you're up buddy.

Nice work ...
biting the hand that feeds us.

If that Softcock wants its name on this cave

He should be down here, getting his hands dirty

What?

You're on my shit list.
We needed those Bail out tanks down here, Josh .

All right, We rely on you to do your job.

No, a job is something you choose to do
Something you get paid for.

Stop treating me like
I'm five years old!

Then stop acting like you are
five years old!

Do you think this some Downhill Ride,
that you can just party.......


Frank ... he was due for a break.

Everybody is due for a break.

I Don't give him a special treatment

You need to easy on him.
That's exactly what I do not need to do.

This Cave can kill you in a heartbeat.

He's a good kid Frank.
Cut him some slack.

Aye, listen ...

I want to stay here
I'll do this push on my own.

No. No one dives alone.
Let's go, J.D. !

Judes, I'm serious.

Frank, I did not came all this way
to sit her on the sidelines and watch.

No! Come on ..

Come on, Are We gonna do this
or We just gonna talk about it?

(winch noise)

I can't even see the bottom.
Ahh, trust me, you gonna love this.

What next?

Would you just Relax!
I'm signing for you right now

Oye.. ,Carl, Are we doing this thing or what?

I'm gonna get in five minutes.
just two seconds! Thanks.

I swear it's still new to find him on a moon.

(Speaking over the cell)

Ah, Look deal with them, will you?!
Tell them I am off for a bit till further notice

So long............ !
( throwing the cell on the cave )

( giggles and guffaws )

Dealt with!.

Now Josh, promise me
you won't let me fall.

I promise, just (ah),just figure through the rock
slow and steady like I showed you, okay?

OK,ok.... Sure.

(Aohh) Here we go ...
 Here we go ...

I met her on my
Everest expedition.

Great, She is even crazier than you are.

Yeah. I'm gonna marry her one day.

Life is not a dress rehearsal Josh.
You gotta to seize the day.

50 $ as I'll reach the bottom before you.

Oh.... You are so about to get spanked.



(wooooooooooooh!!)

Unbelievable!
Yes, it's pretty cool, huh?

Yeah! Amazing

Carl! Rowlingson again.

Tell him he can kiss my ass!

Oh my god ...

Son of a bitch ...

(a sort of Australian chanting or Hymns)

Carl likes to play
by his own rules.

you're okay?
Yab, all good.

Ok.

Push it.

Good to go?
Yeah, let's do it.

See you later ...

( Frank reciting from a Poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge )
(lines 1-5)

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

A stately pleasure-dome decree :

Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

Through caverns measureless to man

Down to a sunless sea
(End of reciting)

(George reciting limerick)
There once was a man from Nantucket

<u>who is headless to shake bucket
(End of George's limerick)</u>

(Judes laughing)
How are you travelling George, you with us?

Roger that.
I'm all over you, Judes.

Yeah, you wish! ...

Just keep the coms clear

(George laughing )

Yeah, well let's keep the poetry to minimum, Frank.

Are you good, Liz?
How long to decompress?

All good.
About 10 minutes.

I'll see you in a couple of hours.

Age and treachery will always
overcome youth and skill

I think that's $ 50 you owe me, buddy.


settle up.
-okay dokey.

Let's do it.

Are you with me Judes?

I'm on your sex
through a dolphin dive.

I do not see anything.

Do not worry about it.
We are about 5 meters from the bottom.

Follow Josh's light.

You're quite a ripple rat
(You got the booster)

Yeah, dad gets me every summer for a month

Lucky you.

I've been dragged in all his stupid expeditions,
all my life

See, it Never occurred to him
to ask if I actually like caving.

Yab, Josh is his own man  ...
Doesn't take  after his dad much ...

Oh, what?! You mean I'm not
XXX the * actually shutdown Nazi asshole?! XXX

True, But he is also the most
Determined cave diver in the world

Do you like caving?

My Old man is obsessed with torture, Right?!.

All cavers are
It's like ah.... That's thing.

Check out what he got me... for my birthday.

It's from a wild boar that is killed by hand
in Ipon's expedition in Borneo.

and then it turned into the torch.

Oh, Wow , that's so Cool ! ...

It's not cool ...

They are like: "wow .. I could  be the first person
to check out some awesome bit of rock......

... Which just like the last
10 miles of plentiness rock.

It's so (huh) Lame.
Ah josh....

You just do not get it, do you?

Your Old man he is.... he is the most respected explorer
of our time.

He's like ... Columbus
or Neil Armstrong.

And these rocks, these caves  ...

Ah man, this is it.

There is nowhere else left
on the planet to explore

I mean, what else you can shine a light
where no humans have been before, Huh?

You want to shine a light where
no humans have been before ?!

Here you go?


Hone on this for a while.

Finally, some excitement.

He's going in without bail out.
His Cain (Australian for pain or loss)

Jesus, Frank, just leave it.

That hole is narrower than a nun's nasty(pussy)

Are you sure you're up for this, Frank?

You don't have to come, Judes.
Yeah , Right ...

plan to dive and dive to plan, Judes ...

Go fuck yourself, George.


That hole looks pretty tight hole, Judes.
I hope your diet, is working for you.

I'm going in after them.

Jesus, Frank ...

(ah .... ah...)

I guess this is starting to gets boring
Ohh, my shit ...

My valve is stuck.

My hand just caught.

I'm wedged.

Beaver smile Judes.
Panic is vulture sits on your shoulders.

Look. It's like a cathedral.

Saint Judes cathedra . ...

Stay calm.

No...He killed her!

That's pullshit.

She is dead because of him!

Listen to me!... Listen to me!...Listen to me!
Oh,..Fuck off!   - Listen to me!...

Body breathing with a full face mask

Is the most radical thing
you can possibly do under water.

He was insane to even try it.

It's the most heroic god dam thing
I have ever seen.

No, that's pullshit!

Listen to me!
-Pullshit!

It wasn't the case of him or her josh ,

This was a bout dipping
one body down there or two.

Once the Judes lost it, it was ...
She was gone.

She wasn't coming alive

Frank had no right taking her
through there without the bailout tanks.

Clearly, that was her choice.

it's full bullshit!
Every fiber of Judes pain was driven to explore

Frank didn't force her to do anything.

No ... No ...

He always pushes too hard.

Josh, no ...

He made this happen ...

Is it somebody want to give me a hand here?

Get her Wrapped up and neg. whole out of here.

Forward base ... Forward base, do you copy?

If I hear, the storm is right on the top of us.

Now it's live striking from the coast!

Damn, Frank! pickup!

Frank, can you hear me?

XXX we hear any word from Jim on a surface, yet? XXX

The ...the Coms are down.

I fortified the connector to Camp 3.

This is camp 4 to surface base, come in

What would you do? On the mountain.

(Radio static)

Camp 4 to surface base, come in.
Jim, do you read me.

There is nothing can be done
for the dead on altitude.

If I were on the mountain
I'd keep going.

Ahh....Damn it!

Judes Knew the risks
better than anyone.

You drag every one along on your big dream.

And they listen to you, and they believe you,
and they wind up down here fucken dead.

God, this thing is a rock dad, nobody cares.

People care.
Oh they don't!

Judes cared.

Nobody out there, in the real world,
give two shits about this.... this fucken cave.

Those bail out empty
you would supposed to bring down

Judes and I,
had to climb back on and get them.

XXX Judes snapped to dive the heavily beneath with couple of hours sleep * XXX

XXX * didn't make any difference XXX

Maybe it did.

Wanna think about that?

All right the Coms. are down.

J.D., Liz, I want you to head back up.
let everyone know, we are coming out.

We gonna need all hands down here

You will never make it!

Frank!

Carl ...

Josh! Get him out of there!

Josh! let it go!

Leave him!

You did everything you could, all right?

Shit the exit!, Shit!

(power went off)

We are heading back down to forward base.

You'll find another way out ...

... through the restriction

Grab anything you see that it's useful.

I said "useful."
Robes, batteries, rebreathers ...

We have a few hours before
this place is under water.

Frank, what if the air bell through the restriction is flooded?

Maybe you should send the ROV through
to check it out.

I won't be flooded.

Jesus George, what if he's wrong?

Then we sure start growing gills, Mate.

This is not my mask.
Where's my mask?

God damn it!

George, give me a hand!

What the fuck are you doing?

Without a suit, you'll go hypothermic.
This is the only one that will fit you.

Huh...Fuck that!
Can't even dive

I cannot do this.
Any of this ......

You can this,
because you have to do this, all right?

You can swim, Can't you?!

You can breathe,
then you can dive.

George will be with you all the way.

You'll be all right.

I thought George couldn't dive anymore.

We're taking him out of retirement.

XXX OK, well ... My oar are tides, Frank. XXX
There is no time to take her of her suit.

Not to .. show me how to use the rebreather.

Listen to me!
No, you listen to me Frank!

I'd rather be cold and alive than Warm and dead.

So, show me what to do!

You'll need it.
So I'm fine in this, Frank.

Show me what to do, because
I do not wearing a wet suit of a dead person.

Get her a mask.

The first rule of diving.
Never hold your breath.

You've been Bent Before bathing in Mexico, right?

Mexico? Fucken Malaysia.
Mexico is where I got the Chlam.

Dad!

Bring your medical kit.
It's Luko.

I'll get it Frank. You go.

He Is still alive.

George, we have morphine?

No. nothing?

How bad is it?!

George, take Josh a way.

What you gonna do?
There is nothing we can do.

What do you mean? You have to do something.

Josh, he's broken every bone in his body.

All right, He cannot Hold the rig in his mouth.

You can't just leave him here to die.
I can't and can't he too.

No, No ...... no ...

You have no..... , You have no right to do This.

You people have no idea, Do you?

You have no idea!

You spend your lives wrapped in comfort,
you want to play of being adventurous.

Well this is it.

Ok, Come on Vic.
Come on.

George ...

Come on mate, it's all right.

It's all right, my friend.

(Speaking native)

How does it look down there?

A walk in the park.

Closing the valve down, All right.

When you take it off, it stays closed, Yes?!

Come here you.

You stay on the guide line, all right.
Do not let go of it.

Remember how clear your mask?

Yeah,
Yeah, Carl instruct me through this whole again.

Good. Now you get to hear it twice.

Keep the mouthpiece no close to valve.

If you flood the breathing loop, it's all over.

We'll have over an hour of decompressing stops
before we can surface

Remember what you told Frank about
decompression sickness? The Bends, Right?!

If you get Bent down there
it's going to ruin your whole day, believe me.

Green light is good,
Red light is bad.

I'll monitor your BP R% too.
Dad, I get. OK?!

All right.

Stay at the same depth as me

Or your blood is gonna fizz up like
a dropped can of bier.

Nice ...

All right, listen up!

Visibility is gonna be stern to shit.
N-a big deal to have visibility.

So stay on the guide line at all times.

I'll bring up the rear.

Victoria is the last one through that restriction.

What?

If you panic in that squeeze,
anyone behind you is dead.

You'll be fine.
Oye, See you on the other side.

He could've picked better choice of words.

(hissing of rebreathers)

YOU CAN do it.

Fuck?!

Where's Carl?

Where's Carl?

We gonna raise your body temperature.
She is hypothermic.

Josh, Get this face blanket.

Yeah

Cross your arms, cross your arms!

Carl! Get here and get your kit off,
you gonna be under here with her.

Come on, get a move man!


George, Get on oxygen.
-No, I'm fine.

Get on oxygen!

It's okay, babe. I'm coming.
Josh, where is that blanket?

Good, here you go!

I got you, I got you.

Her you go, Ohhh baby ...

You gonna be ok.

If you get it hit, baby.

Come here you.

You are no use to me
If you fizz up again.

All right, If we run out of light,
we run out of time.

Conserve your batteries, get some rest.

I still can't feel my feet.

I told I'll take care of you, babe?
hum, Yeah fun times.

Dad!

I should've worn her suit.
Hey, you did great.

You're alive.

You understand no matter what happens,
you never ever give up.

Hey Frank, we should explore
this section while we're waiting.

it might be a way out.

Waiting for what?
Waiting for rescue party.

There is no rescues down here
only body recoveries.

Everyone out there already thinks we are dead.

Don't worry about it.

(Coughing badly)

You all right?

I'm right.
Yeah?

Just taking a leak.

And her she goes .

Now I'm right.

I still think we should sit and wait.

Yeah, we could've enough food
for next Couple of days.

Couple of days,
This cave gonna be underwater.

Understand?

We follow the river and get to the ocean.

OK, this way!

Are you sure?
No.

Come on!

George, you all right?

(Coughing strongly)

I'm fine!

You go on up ahead!

(Breathing hard)

George!

Are you alright?

Aye!.

Did I ever told you about the time
your dad really fucked up ?!

No.

We were Checking out these caves on Malabo we found.

And There was nothing out there,
as far as the eye can see,

is this bloody great big hole,
in the out of nowhere.

So, Frank parks the truck up to the edge of it.
so we can tie off the guide line.

-Right!
-Right.

We did the dive, we swimming back out ...

... and suddenly
there is a vehicle blocking the entrance.

60 feet under water!

I'm thinking: "Shit!
that license plate looks familiar. "

Gone and left the hand break off.
Dam son of bitch

The bull(truck) is dragged back into the cave with us.

We had to smash open the back window
just so we can swim out

Huh...!

Then, the boor bastard had
to walk 30 mile a head...

... 20 mile just to go get some help.

(Coughing  continuously)

humf..! .He's a hell of a fellow
your old man, once you get to know him.

Hold thing for me a little while.

I just need to catch my breath.

Go on ...

Go.

(Coughing up foamy blood)

Fuck!
yab yab.

How are you holding up?

Hot bath and a brandy
and I'll be fine.

Carl! We'll take a break once we hit the top, all right?
Sounds good!

Where's George?

He's aah. .. he's back there somewhere taking
a break. He said he'd catch up with us.

George!

George!

George!(angrily)

Dad, what is going on?
Where did you see him last?

wa, I do not know ...
Where?

he's got The Bends. he doesn't want to
slow us down slow us down.

Dad, his rig is right up!...

George, I know what are you doing!
George, where are you?

George!

Oh Jesus!

Dad!

Oh God!

<i>GEORGE WAS HERE</i>

George, where are you?
Damn it!

George! You don't have to do this!

George!

George, where are you?

Turn that light off .

Come on, Josh. We will make the cover
of National Geographic, yeah!

Hey, .... hey....
What the fuck are you doing?

Dad

When they pull our bodies out of this place,
There is not gonna be any tourist shot.

Not of me and not of my boy!

Understood?

Get off, Frank!

God.., oah!

You okay, baby?
Jesus Christ!

You're actually enjoying this, aren't you Frank?
Hmmmmf?!

Making life or death decisions,
playing the God ...

There is no God down here.

This place does not give a rat's ass about
you or me.

Or any of us.

We are a bits of dust
passing through ...

Carl ...

George has gone.
Oh, what do you mean gone?

He fizzed up.
Decompression sickness.

He's gone ...

Oh, Jesus .
I'm sorry, Frank.

I'm sorry. oh Shit!

Come on, keep up! Josh, Victoria!

(Running water and splashes sounds)

That's a meat grinder down there.
Shit!

Maybe we missed something.
One of those tunnels back there...

No. we follow the river, all the way to the ocean.

Maybe we should head back,
wait for the water to subside water

So we can find another way out.

Carl, you can do whatever you like.
Josh and I going down here .

Can't we least take a vote on it?

All right, let's vote on it.
two against two. now What do we do?

Come on, enough of this pull shit!

Let's go back,
check on those tunnels.

No! Wait!

It's best to stick together.
Okay.

You better be right, Frank.

there's a niche below us, if I can get a cam in there.

I am gonna need an anchor,
So I could reverse around the other side.

Frank, I can hardly feel my fingers.

Dad, it looks pretty tricky,
you should let me do it.

No. Absolutely not.

Let him do it, Frank.

Your son is the best climber we have.

Aye.

you be careful. Please.

I have control.

Have you clipped it ?
Roger that!

All right, give me some slack.

I'm gonna have to improvise this last phase.

Yes!

Are you good?

I'm good!
Good. good boy!

Are you okay?

get that light off her!

Jesus Christ!

Hang on, honey!

Victoria! Try not to move!
What going on?

Her hair caught in a rack!

Jesus Christ!

Hang on there, honey!

Hang on!

Joshua, go back!
Get off that line!

It won't back your weight!

Help me!

Hang on there Vic! We're coming!
Victoria, listen to me!

I'm gonna transfer your weight.
try to get a foot hold.

I can't get a hold!

Oh Christ!
You have to do something!

all right, I'm Coming up!
You're not!

You're Staying here
until we work out a plan.

Victoria, Do not panic!

Hang on, Victoria!

Victoria, Listen to me!
I know you in a lot of pain!

But you have to stay there!
Help me!

Do nothing until we can get
around after you, You understand?

I'm gonna cut my hair free!

No! Do not use a knife!

Put the knife away?

Take that knife away from the rope!

I can get up to her!

Christ!

Put your knife away, Victoria!
I can climb up there and I can get her!

You understand me!

I can get up to her!

Victoria!

Christ!
Jesus Christ!

Nahhhhhhhhh!

We should keep going.

Josh ...

Victoria made her own choices.

All right!, she chose to come down here
Without experience,

Chose to dive without a wet suit

She chose to use her knife.

That's three big mistakes.

In a place alike ,you're lucky
get away with one.

Now we've only got one rebreather left.

You heartless bastard.

Have you no decency?

Who the hell do you think you are?

We can mourn her in the daylight.

We gotta get on.

Since when did you become like this?
Look ...

Josh ...

I know I have not been any thing
of a father to you. All right....

I'm not up there for a stop mate.
that is the fact.

CDs, cars, and mortgages ...

I could never be
what your mother needed  ...

... or probably what you needed.

Why ...?!!!

...  Why caves?

Down here, I can make sense of this.

XXX  Can you * mean *...XXX

It's like my church.

I can hold a mirror up
and say :"This is who I am".

I do not want to die, Dad.

I do not want to die down here.

It's alright ...

It's alright, mate!

You're not gonna die.

I'm sorry.

I'm gonna get you out of here, all right?
Yab.

Good.

Let's keep moving.

Jesus Christ! Not that again.

All right, We rest up here for awhile.

Then I'll take the last rebreather
run through, see if she goes.

Then I'll come back to get you, Josh.

And later you, Carl, yab?
Sure, Frank. Whatever what say.

Dad! Carl is taking the rebreather !

What is he doing?

He's not gonna come back.

You son of a bitch!

Fuck!

Come on!

Dad!

Is it dead?
Yab.

Well The tunnel could choke
Then he'd have to come back.

If the tunnel chokes,
we're dead anyway.

So what do we do now?

I do not know ...

I'm tired. I need to rest.

What are you talking about? We have to go back.
You'll find another way out.


What's wrong with you?

You remind me of me.

Shit!


Bat Shit!

You think there's a way out?

I'm guessing the bats didn't swim down here.

"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan"
"A stately pleasure-dome decree  "

What's that?

Coleridge(Samuel Taylor Coleridge).

XXX Very bisskipy. XXX

Well He was on drugs when he write it.

I did not you're into poetry.

I'm not .

Your mother was.

Teach it for me.

Bravo!

Oh. I have turned off the light.

Christ! ...

Ah Shit! Okay...

(watch beep)

You should rest up.

(watch beep)

Dad, I can see you .

(bat screeching)

Well, we're not climbing out of here.

Well, that's something you don't see every day.
A tank?

A bloody tank?!

Japanese. They were all over this place during the war.

Amphibious.

We must be pretty near the coast.

The cave must have collapsed underneath them.

You think anyone survived?
Doesn't look like it.

Well there you go.

I told you!

We could stay here, you know.
hope that someone finds us.

Assuming they are looking for us.

Assumptions is the mother of all fuckups.

That's sounds familiar.

Man we are so close  ...
Now she is teasing us.

Oh, don't take it personally.
We are here now and that the main thing.

So What would we do? do we Stay here
or do we push on?

You decide.

<i>FRANK AND JOSH WERE HERE.
SEE Ya!</i>

Hey Dad, I found the river!

Lost my grip.

Well, You should be more careful.


Carl ...

Nah.......... empty.

Dead.

The river has flushed
everything here like a sewer.

Yeah ... it stinks in here.

Josh? Frank? is that you guys?

Oh, oh Thank God!

Carl ...

What the fuck?

Where the hell were you thinking?

Well, I was gonna come back for you guys.
I would have come back.

I would've, you know!
I just ran out of air.

Please! Do you got any food?
Yeah, of course.

Oh.. Thank you!
Thank you!

Frank! Please do not go over there, Frank!.

Frank! Please, don't!

The river dumped her here, Josh.

Like a piece of garbage.

Oh, Josh I'm sorry, buddy!
I missed up, you know!

I admit it, I missed up, okay!

I panicked.
It was a moment of madness.

I do not know what to do.

I'm sorry!

Good got a Chances ...

Josh, let's go.

Wait! What?

Josh?

Josh?

No! No! No! you're not gonna leave me here!
No Wait!

You can do whatever you like.

Frank!

Well fuck you, Frank!

She goes.

There is a tight squeeze...
yahh ...

But once you get through it, it's crystal clear.

Well we'll body breathe through the sub.

One breath each, not shallow breath.
What about Carl?

I'll go get him.

I can't breathe ...

It's...It's my back ...

Put me down, Josh.

Josh, you.... you Trust the cave, all right?
Trust the cave!

Follow the river. I'll lead you out.

What?! no no?!
No. We can still make it.

And we can body breathe, like you said.
It'll be fine.

He killed Victoria, Josh!

Luko ... he'll kill all of us!

you take one step closer, and I'll fucken kill you!

The only reason we're still breathing is because of him.

Josh, could you.....
could you get me into the water?

Could you help me into the water?

Oh Good , Oh good ...

You've got better instincts
than me.

So Listen to them, all right ?

You keep going.

Do not you give up, or you will be back
on my shit list.

No. Dad, I'm not leaving you here.

Can you....Can you help me?

Help me.
I don't want this to take too long.

No!No!No!
No!

That's all right ...

I'll stay .... I'll stay with you ...
I will stay......

You'll be fine.

No.

Just help me.

I'm so proud of you, Josh.

Please help me.

Joshua ...

Josh!

It's time to go.

Are we home yet?

Nearly.

George was right.

I never knew my father,
but I've found him in that cave.

He was a hell of a fellow,
once you get to know him .
