Tea for Two

Picture me upon your knee

Just tea for two
and two for tea

Just me for you
and you for me alone

Nobody near us
to see us or hear us

No friends or relations
on weekend vacations

We won't ever known, dear

That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and I'll awake

And start to bake that
sugar cake

For you to take for
all the boys to see

We will raise a family

A boy for you, a girl for me

Oh, can't you see how happy

Oh, can't you see how happy

Oh, can't you see how happy
we would be?

Thank you

On January 161938 Carnegie
Hall was the home of one

of the famous jazz
concerts ever

Outside it was a cold night,
but inside

Well, that was another story

The music was blazing hot

Thanks to Benny Goodman's band
and his famous quartet

Who were joined on stage
for ajam session by Count Basie

And sidemen from Basie's
and Duke Ellington's Orchestras.

Ever since then almost every
important jazz musician

has graced
the stage of Carnegie

In no small measure that was
due to the fact that

the Carnegie Hall was
the New York home for

Norman Granz's Jazz
at the Philharmonic

Those landmark shows, which began
in Los Angles fifty years ago

Were the foundation of
Verve Records

In fact J. J. Johnson who played
trombone in our opening number s

was at the very first concert

Actually the lineups for
those Jazz at the Phil shows

Were virtual who's
who ofjazz history

So tonight we salute those
composers and players

Legendary masters who've made jazz
an uniquely American art form

You know way back in the 1950's
when I was a kid in school

studying classical music

There was one jazz artist
who showed me that to play jazz

You didn't have to abandon
your formal training

One player who whether he was
performing jazz or classical

could still blow everybody
outta the water

Of course,
I'm talking about Art Tatum

Very simply, Art Tatum
was one of the most incredible

instrumentalist
jazz has ever known

His technique was awesome

And his genius has intimidated
virtually every other jazz pianist

Including me

As Fats Waller once said
when he saw Art walk in to a club:

"God is in the house"

To play "Willow Weep for Me"
in tribute to Art Tatum

Here is one the most versatile
and accomplished players

in modern jazz history

Ajazz master
in his own right

This smooth and gifted musician
has been an important part

of the jazz scene
for five decades

Please welcome Hank Jones

Willow Weep for Me

You know I was just backstage
thinking what it means to me

to be here tonight

Singing with these great
musicians on stage at Carnegie Hall

My parents were both music
teachers are so proud

And Mr. Morosco
my high school orchestra leader

Well, if he could see me now

I sang "Tea for Two" with
high school orchestra and also

with a small swing
band back then

And one of my dreams is that
someday be in front of a big band

like the Count Basie Orchestra

Count Basie was born in New Jersey
and studied with Fats Waller

But it's sound springs
from the Kansas City blues

Basie's spare and precise
playing contrasted to

his band's locomotive power

And defined one of the most
distinctive and popular styles

in jazz history

After World War II when the
decline of the big bands began

Basie survived
by scaling down to an octet

But thanks to Norman Granz who
signed an account to Verve Records

Basie was be able to reform
his big orchestra

Some of his best later-day
moments came in collaboration

with singers like Frank Sinatra
and Ella Fitzgerald

Frank Foster's "Shiny Stockings"
was a hit in 1955

In '63, Quincy Jones
rearranged it for the now classic

"Ella & Basie" album with the
lyrics by all people Ella herself

Here with the J. J. Johnson
and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band

Is a versatile performer
who started singing jazz with

the Thad Jones & Mel
Lewis Big Band

And has even earned
a Tony Award for her role

on the Broadway musical
The Wiz

with "Shiny Stockings" please
welcome Miss Dee Dee Bridgewater

Shiny Stockings

Those silk shiny stockings
that I wear when I'm with you

I wear cause you told me
that you dig that crazy hue

When we go to a dance

Do you think of romance?

Oh no, you take a glance
at those shiny stockings

Then came along some chick
with great big stockings, too

Then you change
your mind about me

Why I never knew

I guess I'll have to find

A new some other kind

The guy who digs my shiny
stockings, too

Shiny stockings

Shiny stockings

Then came along some chick
with great big stockings, too

And then you changed
your mind about me

Why I never knew

I guess I'll have to find

A new some other kind

A guy who digs
my shiny stockings now

He'll dig my shiny stockings
whoa and how

J. J. Johnson, Kenny Burrell

Thank you

Well as you just heard

To put the music across
ajazz singer needs a terrific song

Sometime even more importantly
she needs a wonderful arrangement

That's something that Ella
always had when she did

an incredible songbook series

Many of those records
feature brilliant arrangements

by the great Nelson Riddle

So I'm very happy to say
that this next song

Cole Porter's
"Just One of Those Things"

Just One of Those Things

As Dorothy Parker once said
to her boyfriend, "fare thee well"

As Columbus announced

When he knew he was bounced

"It was swell, Isabel, swell"

As Abelard said to Eloise

"Don't forget to drop
a line to me, please"

As Juliet cried
in her Romeo's ear

"Romeo, why can't you face
the fact, my dear"

It was just
one of those things

Just one of those
crazy flings

One of those bells
that now and then rings

Just one of those things

It was just one of
those nights

Just one of those
fabulous flights

A trip to the moon
on gossamer wings

Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit,
of the end of it

When we started
painting the town

We'd have been aware
that our love affair

Was too hot, not to cool down

Well good-bye, dear, and amen

Here's hoping
we meet now and then

It was great fun

But it was just
one of those things

Just one of those things

Just one of those crazy things

A trip to the moon
on gossamer wings

Just one of those things

Just one of those nights

Just one of those
fabulous flights

A trip to the moon
on gossamer wings

Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit,
of the end of it

When we started
painting the town

We'd have been aware
that our love affair

Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen

Here's hoping we meet
now and then

It was great fun

But it was just one of
those things

Thank you, thank you

In his early days

Bud Powell quickly earned
a reputation for his phenomenal technique

And he was often
compared to Art Tatum

One night Tatum went
to check out the competition

Before seeing Powell play

Tatum was heard to say:

"He is all right hand"

But Powell overheard that
remark and when he came out

He played the entire set with
his right hand behind his back

One of the great innovators
in the history ofjazz

Bud Powell was to the piano
what Charlie Parker was to the alto sax

A leader
who set the style for his generation

and many generations
of players

Powell was purist in the fast tempos
but no matter what the pace

Powell played with an
emotional fury and fire

He was the quintessential
bebop pianist

Here to pay tribute to
Bud Powell

Please welcome Japan's premier
jazz pianist Yosuke Yamashita

Parisian Thoroughfare

Almost fifty years ago Dizzy
Gillespie and Charlie Parker

led their pioneering bop quintet
at 52nd St's Downbeat Club

Just around the corner from
here where we are tonight

They tell the story of day
when a young Miles Davis said:

"Hey Dizzy, I can do everything
you can do on the trumpet"

And Dizzy replied:
"Yah, but an octave lower"

Dizzy Gillespie is one of
the real giants ofjazz

A founding father of bebop

His speed, high notes
harmonic sophistication

and technical brilliants

Even the shape of his horn
made him a one of a kind player

In the mid 40's

Dizzy and friends made history
as part of the legendary bop band

Formed by the great vocalist
Billy Eckstine

One of Dizzy's busiest
contributions was that he brought

the Afro-Cuban rhythms
of the Caribbean into jazz

His 1947 collaboration
with Chano Pozzo

a legendary Cuban Conga player

Is an exciting mix
of rhythm and horn cadenzas

Here are trumpet soloist Roy
Hargrove percussionist Don Alias

Steve Turre on shells and
the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band

In a salute to Dizzy's many
recordings of "Manteca"

Manteca

In the late 1950's

Bill Evans joined
the Miles Davis Quintet

Bringing with him an entirely new
harmonic approach to jazz piano

According to legend

On Bill's first night with
the band when Miles wasn't playing

He stood directly over the piano
studying what Bill Evans was doing

Now having come to jazz
through Bill Evans

I know why Miles was paying
such close attention

As did his idol Bud Powell

Bill Evans brought the harmonies
of the classical composers to jazz

Evans showed that
impressionism could swing

That cool could embrace
the warmth of romanticism

Right now, I'd like to pay
tribute to one of my idols

By performing his classic
"Turn Out the Stars"

To do that, I've asked an
old friend of mine to join me

He is John McLaughlin

Turn Out the Stars

In the 1960's the American public
seemed to turn away from jazz

But there were a few artists
who managed to break through

And one of the most successful
was the instantly recognizable

Signature guitar sound of
Wes Montgomery

He began by emulating his idol
Charlie Christian

But as the story goes
his original style wasn't really

influenced by anybody

Montgomery played with his
thumb instead of a pick

Because he didn't want to
disturb his neighbors

Or wake his sleeping children

Right now we are fortunate enough
to have one of the legendary

musicians from that period
with us tonight

With "Walk on the Wildside"
his biggest hit from the 60's

Here is a man who was a frequent
collaborator with Wes Montgomery

And a great innovator
in his own right

Please welcome the world's
greatest jazz organist, Jimmy Smith

Walk on the Wildside

Thank you very much
thank you, thank you

Long time ago

Wes Montgomery and I did a thing called
"Down by the Riverside"

And God bless his soul

We're gonna try to do it tonight
I have another friend of mine

Mr. Kenny Burrell, a great guitarist

And we are gonna do it for you
thank you

Down by the Riverside

Yellowstone

Here are
Herbie Hancock and John McLaughlin

with their homage to Miles Davis

It's About That Time
