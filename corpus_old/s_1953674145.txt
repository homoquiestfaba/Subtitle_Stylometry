Wow! Hey guys!
Hi!

Welcome to Stage 28.

This is where we did
season one, two, and three.

And now we're back, last day...
Yeah

of season five.

Camera's up and rolling.

How tired are you guys?

Marker.


Today we're filming some of the
last scenes for the final episode.


It's so strange, like, it's over.

I gotta go.

(Passion Pit's "Carried Away" playing)

Oh, my God! The last day!
This is it!

It's crazy. It's chaos.
It's the end of the show.

â™ª

It's a wrap!

When did we get so old?
(Scoffs) Oh, please.

We're still young, we're still hot,

and we're gonna wreck this party.
(Laughs)

â™ª Since my heart is golden,
I've got sense to hold in â™ª

(Jessica Lowndes) It's crazy.

It's the last day that
I'm playing Adrianna,

and it's been a character

that's been a part of
my life for five years.

Come on. It's the last chance
for all of us to party together.

The things that we've gotten to do

and some of the places we've gone,

I never thought I'd get to see.

â™ª I'm your friend, don't quote me â™ª

I learned high school on
TV. And then it was the prom.

Most of us graduated for the first time...
(Laughs)


â™ª Who says we have cold hearts? â™ª

The fans love this guy.

(Girls scream)

I don't get it.
(Laughs) What?

â™ª Wake up in the morning â™ª

I think the best moments is
stuff we did in between takes.

The work days, the hours,

the stupid conversations
that make sense to us...

(Jessica Stroup laughs)
after 13 hours of being on set together.

It was the camaraderie.

It kind of forged us as a family.

â™ª I get carried away â™ª

â™ª carried away from... â™ª

I just learned so much and grown so much

over the last five years on the show.

â™ª Sorry, sorry 'bout that â™ª

â™ª Sorry 'bout things that... â™ª

It was so cool.

It's like the coolest television family.


I just hope that people have
been entertained for five years.

("Beverly Hills, 90210" theme song playing)

<i>Yeah, everyone and their mother, literally,</i>

uh, was used to the original show.
Yeah.

â™ª

I think there was a little pressure,

'cause I think people had expectations.
Yeah.

and attention and the hype

that was being thrown
at us was so shocking.

It wasn't like any other show.

I can't say that enough.

It wasn't like getting
cast on any other show.

They were trying to do the similarities.

"Annie's gonna be the Brenda" you know.

many interviews in the beginning

people were, "oh, so you're the Dylan?

"You're... you're Dylan. You're Dylan."
(Jessica stroup) Yeah.

And I'm like, "well,
I mean, yeah, I guess."

And I think people were...
were definitely expecting

a lot more of what the
show was, you know, before.

We were our own show

with our own characters, new storylines.

You sound like a spoiled brat.

Well, you sound like a little bitch.

Navid! My water just broke.

You used me.
It's not like you didn't have fun, right?

Screw you, Naomi!

<i>Screw all of you!</i>

Oh, God. What is happening?

Is it like this every week?
Pretty much.

Everyone wanted to compare us
initially in that first year.

But by the second season,
no one seemed to be caring

that we were technically
a spin-off show anymore.

Yeah.

â™ª



Whoo!

interests was capturing L.A.

or... or showcasing L.A. I
wanted to shoot at the beach.

You know, I think I had a wish list, maybe,

of, like, the Hollywood
sign, Musso and Frank's,

Griffith Park Observatory.

I felt like this is a California show.

This is a young show.

So to being teenagers.

To being teenagers.
Whoo!

Even from where I'm from...
I'm from South Carolina...

there's... I got friends down
there that watch the show.

And it's exciting. You
wanna see this world.

You wanna see California.
Mm-hmm.

That's the whole point of it.
It's, uh, its own character.

â™ª I've got you in a
spell, you're hypnotized â™ª

<i>Shooting at the Hollywood Bowl
was the biggest highlight ever,</i>

and getting to meet Ne-Yo,

who is one of the best dancers
on the planet, in my opinion.

He's so talented.

â™ª Let me love you â™ª

â™ª let me love you â™ª

â™ª oh, oh â™ª

â™ª

She shot at the Hollywood sign.

What are you doing up there?

You don't love me anymore!

Jasper, no!

We faked it, though. It was like...

What?!
Yeah.

I didn't even know that! (Laughs)

(Woman, amplified voice) What's up?!

Welcome Taio Cruz here
at the Playboy Mansion!

The 100th episode, we shot
at the Playboy Mansion.

I had to go scout that
location. That was interesting.

(Both laugh)

What are you doing here?

We're the entertainment for tonight.
(Whispers) What?

We had a lot of guest stars, musical stars.

You're Adrianna Tate-Duncan, right?

And you're Carly Rae Jepsen.


Iconic L.A. people.

Oh, and one more thing, Kim,

whenever you're on "Who wore it best""

I vote for the other girl.


You know who was cool? Denise Richards.

Denise Richards was awesome!
Denise Richards was awesome.

Oh, my God. I don't know what to say.

Well, don't cry. Your mascara will run.

I guess the guest star that
sticks out is Snoop Dogg.

(Deep voice) Snoop Dogg!

(Normal voice) Snoop Dogg.

I...  know you probably
hear this all the time.

I'm a big fan.

Kind of obsessed even, but
in a... in a healthy way.

Yeah. I can dig it.

We had Perez Hilton on in season four.

Hi. Are you Annie?

That was exciting for the cast. (Laughs)

Patrick said you were writing a paper

about celebrity bloggers,
and he thought I could help.

I am.

<i>I mean, there's been (Bleep)
that's been written about us,</i>

but we're like, "don't
believe what you read."

I think once he was doing the show,

it was all good.
(Chuckles) Right, yeah.

The, um, actors...
Mended some fences.

Yeah. Exactly.


(Cheers and applause)



Oh, my God.

In the episode before this
one that's going to air,

I was performing on a stage,

and the stage collapsed on top of me.

And we're, like, a complete
mess. I need a shower.

He looks like this every
day before hair and makeup.

It's like some "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" action.
(Laughs) Right?

That made no sense.
(Laughs)

'Cause we've been under rubble all day.

Rubble, smoke machines.
(Chuckles) Yes.

It's all going to our heads. (Laughs)

What would you say is
your biggest weakness?

Um...

(Brakes screech, thud) (Grunts)

Last year, I was involved in a hit-and-run.

I accidentally killed a man.

<i>Well, there is a weakness. (Sighs)</i>

â™ª

My character started
as a fish out of water,

obviously...

Hey, look. There she is.

What's up, farm girl? How you doin'?


Then soon became a hooker.


<i>Oh, my God.</i>

They... they paid us to hang out with them?

Bree, we are like prostitutes.

No, we're not prostitutes. We're escorts.

And then it turned into
her writing a... a blog

that was sort of a sexy
"Fifty Shades of Grey" blog,

and then publishing it as a book.

Did you actually write a dirty tell-all book

<i>about being a hooker?</i>

I mean... congratulations.

But... seriously?

Annie is also the conscience of the show.

<i>(Annie's voice) "And I
knew love had a price."</i>

stuff she was going through,

she was always the grounded center.

Despite my, uh,

roguish good looks and easy charm,

I'm still pretty...

insecure.
(Laughs)

Dixon was kind of always
getting himself into trouble.

right to remain silent.


He had a gambling addiction,

addiction to...

(Lara) A.D.H.D. Meds.
Yeah.

Dixon, I'm not leaving until we
talk about your drug addiction.

What is this, an afterschool special?

Tristan, who plays Dixon, is
really passionate about music,

and Tristan helped us sort
of discover that in Dixon,

and that eventually became a
big part of Dixon's character.

<i>*</i>

Annie always made sure to look
out for her younger brother.

$40,000? Annie, we can't afford that.

You just concentrate
on getting better, okay?

I will take care of the money.

The final moment between Annie and Dixon

is Dixon telling Annie, "I'm
gonna look out for you, too."

For me, uh, playing Silver,

I've loved her. I've respected her.

Um, she's been difficult.

It's like chemistry.

Like... baking soda and vinegar.

You can put vinegar with
something other than baking soda

and it won't react the same way.

S... so my movie in this
example is the vinegar.

That was something that I
was really passionate about,

was having a bipolar character.

And philosophically, it was important to me

to say that having a
mental health condition

wasn't defining as a person.


But it did! It did make sense!

Playing those episodes where
she is in a manic episode,

and saying lines so fast

and trying to put everything in order,

is some of the most difficult work

that I've ever gotten to do.

And, uh, I'm grateful for that.

<i>Hi, Erin. This is Dr. Harper
from the genetic screening.</i>

<i>We've received your results.</i>

<i>Please call us back to schedule
a review as on as possible.</i>

In season four, she began a storyline

involving her own genetic
link to breast cancer,

and that became kind of a
big part of... of her life

in the next two seasons.
Right.

Look, Navid, this is something
that I need to go through alone.

<i>But those test results
don't just affect you!</i>

How could you be so selfish?

Navid started as a good guy.

Navid is a good guy.
Navid is just a good guy.

You're here.


Navid is the nice guy...

You're the best boyfriend.

And there's just something
very genuine about him.

I'm done being the nice
guy that finishes last.

For such a nice guy, he gets punched in the face a lot.
Yes.



Yes! (Jessica Lowndes laughs)

We finished season 5 of "90210""

the entire series full-on complete.

We nailed it. I'm going home right now.

I'm gonna take off these dirty clothes

because I've been under
rubble for an entire day.

But now I gotta go shower.

<i>When Matt came on the
show, he was so quiet.</i>

For five years, I ragged on
him and jumped on him and...

I don't think I was shy. I
think was just doing my thing.

Oh, and he was brooding.
He was, like, super sexy.

You know?

No, I remember being there... (Laughing)

but I don't remember
being brooding and sexy.

â™ª

I love Liam 'cause he's
always got a good heart.

Liam was originally created

sort of as this bad boy, artistic kid.

Tick... tock. Tick... tock.

What is that supposed to mean?

Nothing. Just wondering
how long it's gonna take

for you to drop the nice girl act.

We had a lot of Liam as
things... things happening to him.


$25,000.

Oh, you Beverly Hills
kids with your allowance...




He was discovered as a model,

then he became a movie
star sort of accidentally.

Oh, you saved the universe.

(Strained voice) You can tell my boss

that I'm putting in for overtime.

<i>(Music swells) (Man) Cut!</i>

The guy, let's be honest is not the sharpest tool in the shed.
(Laughs)

You know, some of this method
stuff actually makes sense.

Like... when I got impaled by the alien,

I could've been thinking

about getting into a motorcycle accident...

with an alien.


being taken advantage
of one girl to the next

to the next to the next.

Okay... shoot! There goes all his money.

And then he's literally
getting shipped off in a crate.

Uhh!

You gonna put me in a box?

By the end of the finale,
he is finally able to say,

"this is what I want. This is who I am."

Adrianna's really into Adrianna,

which is always funny to me. (Laughs)

You know, I am...

a teenage recovering drug addict

on the cover of every tabloid magazine.

I can't be a mother...

be a reality star! (Giggles)

She did some pretty unethical
things... stealing music...

Hey, another amazing performance tonight.

You know, pretending you wrote a song

you actually stole from a dead man.

Swapping out Silver's bipolar meds.
Yeah.


(Pills rattle)

Yeah, pretty bad.
That blew up my Twitter feed.

There was no trace of
medication in your system.

What does that mean? The
medicadion stopped working?

No, it means you haven't been taking it.

Why do you have Silver's pills?



You switched out my pills.
You're a pathological liar.

No, guys. I'm not... no, I'm not lying.

Adrianna, you need to go.

Kind of her whole focus

in season four was just
kind of winning back

everybody's trust and forgiveness.

(Voice breaks) I'm gonna
try and be a better person.

I'm not gonna give up.

â™ª

Naomi started off as evil queen bitch

of Beverly Hills... West Bev 90210.

Good morning, skank.
Get a life, Naomi.

And then you see towards
the end where she...

I mean, well, in the very end,

she's as narcissistic as she's ever been.
Yeah.

But there were moments
in there when she had

some genuine concern for
people's well-being. (Laughs)

(Audience gasps)

(Amplified voice) So here
I stand, a former bitch,

asking for you forgiveness.

Please don't let the message get lost

just because I'm physically perfect.

Naomi always has been a mix

of likable and unlikable qualities.

And the sort of buoyancy and energy

that Annalynne brings.

(Amplified voice) It seems...
that the winner is a write-in.



Annalynne just cracks me up.

I mean, she just... she
just... slaughters me.

I mean, she's just hilarious.

I remember season two when
the new showrunner came in.

She's like, "you're funny.
We're gonna write you funny",

and I'm like...

(Dramatic voice) "I am not
funny. I am very serious".

no. You're hilarious."

You all are beautiful women.

of me in each of you,

and I love that part of me.

The only person that gets laughs
in the read-through is this one.

else is like, "wah-wah-wah."

And then Annalynne says two words,

and everyone's like, "blah! Ha ha ha!"

It's awesome.

Namaste, bitches.

I can't shop. I can't spa.

I... I might as well eat
fast food out of a trash can.

If I have to endure this
game for one more minute,

I swear to God,

I will bake a cake six stories
high and jump off the top of it.

This is the most pathetic pity party ever.

Seriously, somebody cue the sad music,

break out the Chardonnay,

and can we all just turn 30, why don't we?

(Girls screaming)

Aah!

<i>My God!</i>

Really?! (Scoffs)

Now, like, we've been together for so long,

we're... when one actor is not there,

we just suddenly start
pretending to be them.

It was like, "oh, I'm... I'm
Liam. I'm brooding and angry."

It's like... (Laughs) and then there's...

Lowndes is just like...

â™ª La la la (Laughs)

And now, the CW's "Whose
Line Is It Anyway?"

takes a look back at 90210.

Hi, I'm Aisha Tyler, host of the
improv show "Whose Line is it Anyway?"

which premieres this summer on the CW.

We're gonna play a game right
now, called "Greatest Hits"

with Ryan Stiles, Colin
Mochrie and Wayne Brady

with music from Laura
Hall, and Linda Taylor.

Ryan and Colin are two
TV voice-over artists

talking about the latest compilation album

and Wayne's gonna improvize
snippets of the song,

and the title of your album gentlemen is...

"Songs of 90210".

Oh.
Check it away.

Good morning America.

What a CD set we have for you today.

We're celebrating 90210,

the greatest zip code since 4...

Is it a zip code?

I never realized it was a zip code!

Oh, now the show makes sense.

You know Colin, I love my r'n'b,

but I love my upbeat r'n'b,

my sexy r'n'b...

I'm not even sure what it
stands for, but I love it!

And you know, when I think sexy upbeat

r'n'b songs, and I think 90210.

I think of that one that was on the top
of the charts for over 3 weeks straight.

"Nobody's Ugly".

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª 90210... damn â™ª

â™ª if it's something that you ever see â™ª

â™ª you've never seen somebody ugly â™ª

â™ª in this class â™ª

â™ª there's no one's face
that looks like ass â™ª

â™ª from the teacher down the hall â™ª

â™ª to the janitor playing basketball â™ª

â™ª they're pretty â™ª

â™ª in Beverly Hills, this city â™ª

â™ª 'cause ain't nobody ugly â™ª

â™ª ain't nobody ugly â™ª

â™ª even the ugliest person is
better than the prettiest person â™ª

â™ª that you know  â™ª


â™ª on the show â™ª

â™ª ain't nobody ugly â™ª

â™ª everybody on the street   â™ª

â™ª is someone that you would want to hug â™ª

â™ª and make love to
because ain't nobody ugly â™ª

â™ª nobody looks like [â™ª]

â™ª no no no â™ª

â™ª the features are chiselled â™ª

â™ª and the bodies are tight â™ª

â™ª they only look like
models that you wanna pop â™ª

â™ª bottles within the night â™ª

â™ª ain't nobody got big ears, long nose â™ª

â™ª sorry Ryan, I know you're trying â™ª

â™ª Ohh â™ª

â™ª No-no-nobody â™ª

â™ª ain't nobody ugly â™ª

â™ª in 90210-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0 â™ª

â™ª No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... â™ª

â™ª no-no-no-no... â™ª

â™ª not one person... â™ª

[*]

What a lovely song.

What a lovely song.

But you've said that three times already.
What a

lovely, lovely song.
Four.

You know what, when I think Beverly Hills

and I think that's a zip code,

I think Japanese pop.

Oh.
And you know,

what are the greatest Japanese pop songs

concerning 91020... 90...

You know,

it's actually the only Japanese pop

concerning 90210.
Oh.

It's that Japanese
pop-hit, "We'll be back"...

â™ª [Miming Japanese] â™ª

â™ª [Miming Japanese] your reboot â™ª

â™ª [Miming Japanese] of franchise! â™ª

â™ª [Miming Japanese] â™ª

â™ª [Miming Japanese] only one black guy â™ª

â™ª We'll be back â™ª
â™ª We'll be back â™ª

â™ª 90210 â™ª

â™ª 90210 â™ª

â™ª [Miming Japanese] screw it! â™ª

â™ª [Miming Japanese] â™ª
â™ª We'll be back â™ª

â™ª [Miming Japanese] â™ª

â™ª Number one superstar on Beverly Hills â™ª

â™ª Yeah! â™ª

â™ª We'll be back â™ª

We love you 90210!

Thanks for a great time!

"Whose Line Is It Anyway?"

summer premiere, Tuesday,
July 16 on the CW.

Baby, I love you.

I feel good. I feel good today. (Laughs)

Yesterday, I was like, heart broken.

Today, it feels... it's
okay. We had a minute.

Yeah. We actually had a
nice little heart-to-heart.

(Imitates sobbing) I love you!

I think you're amazing!

Mmm! (Laughs)

First one to 10 wins.

Fight! (Bell dings)

Uhh! (Crowd) Ooh!

Well, I always enjoy watching you get...
(Laughs)

slimed or some sort of...

â™ª

(Girls scream, crowd cheering)

Aah! What are you doing?!

The best thing ever. It was one take.

"I'm not doing it again,

so ya better get it on all your cameras".

This is what she does...


I literally face-plant in the mud.

Oh, my God! That is it!

You've probably seen the episode
where she was directing a video

that Liam was in.
And... action.


the beer is cold.

That was one of the best, I think, for us.

I have never laughed so hard in my life.
(Laughs) It's so stupid.

I had to pour a beer on myself...
Oh!

And Millicent, the director,
she's like, "do it sexier""

<i>and I'm like, "what does that mean?"</i>

(jessica stroup) And there's
a fan on him. (Matt laughs)

I mean, there's napkins flying. Ridiculous.

And... that's a wrap.

There was one scene in
particular that I remember.

I was kind of doing a dream sequence.


feeding each other chocolate mousse.


Then all of a sudden, Teddy
appears with his, like...

(Michael) Oh, yeah.
Shirt open, and his, like, stomach's rippling.

And we cracked up every time, like,

Trevor had to open his shirt. (Laughs)

It was comedy.

â™ª

Do you, Madison,

take Max to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

I do.
Stop! You can't marry her.

She's not the love of your life, Max.

<i>I am.</i>

Any time we came up with a storyline

where... when you told someone

the idea, they gasped...

that was something that
was exciting and fun.

Will you have a baby with me, Teddy?

Wow.

The actors... you would tell them

and they would get kind of excited about,

"I can't believe that's gonna happen".

Vanessa, we are not engaged.

Let me go!
No! Aah!

(Truck horn blaring)

(Loud crash)

I did like the storyline where
Liam gets in an accident...

(Tires screech)

and a woman came and helped him...

There's been an accident.
It was a hit-and-run.

And then ended up conning him.

Honey, you ain't seen nothing yet.

â™ª

(Mr. Cannon) I'm kicking
you off "The Blaze."

No! What do you want? Just
name it. I'll do anything.

Please, please, please! I'll do anything.

For a very materialistic show,

we've touched on some really,
really important social issues.

Are you offering to sleep with me?

What?

In terms of the rape storyline,

obviously that was a really serious one...

Mr. Cannon sexually harassed me.

And one that was risky,
I guess, just in terms of,

could we as a show handle it?

I went to Mr. Cannon's classroom,

and I was alone with him.

And...

nothing happened.


<i>(Rebecca) And then something does happen.</i>

or I will tell! Stop!

Who you gonna tell? Who you gonna tell?

Who's gonna believe you?

You're the girl who cried wolf.

I've had fans reach out to me on Twitter

who have, you know, felt a connection to me

in regards to what happened to Naomi

because of the TV show that, you know,

was totally for high schoolers.

(Jessica stroup) My boyfriend on the show

Teddy... who was played
by, uh, Trevor Donovan...

uh, turns out to be gay.

You don't have to worry, okay?

I'm not gonna tell
anybody that we hooked up.


which is something that happens in TV,

is you create a character one way,

and then you watch the character evolve

in ways that you hadn't anticipated.

But it had occurred to me in season two

that there was more to
that character than we knew.

What, uh, what were you guys talking about?

Why does this guy keep
talking about being a player?

I mean, every episode he was going like,

"I'm a player. I'm a player.

Watch out, Silver. I'm a player."

It's like, he protests too much, I think.

Teddy, uh, just try to
stick with the counts.

Mm. Okay, watch Navid.

Yeah! Watch the master.

I... I'm proud of that
story for two reasons.

One, because I feel like
people really did respond

and it was meaningful and had some effect.

And also because I feel like we were able

to tell it in a way that
took every sort of zig and zag

as he came out.

What... what is wrong with you?

Look, sorry if I can't dance,

but I'm not a frickin' faggot like you.

That experience of what that kind of fear

and... and how palpable
that is in high school.

Look, Ian, I get that you
came out in the ninth grade,

but I'm just not there yet.

I know I'm gay.

I... I just need some time to process that.

And just how it just seems
like the end of the world

to be who you are.

How am I supposed to ask someone

to be okay with who I am when...

I'm not?

Your friends... we love you.

And I love you even more now
that I know who you really are.

It impacted some kids out there,
and they let me know, and it's...

that's when it starts to
get, like, touching, you know.

Like you're doing it for a purpose.

It's my last shot of "90210" for good.

Um...

It's been a... a fun, special run.

You know, we've all
had such an amazing time

over the last five years.

So it's a... it's a
weird feeling to be done.

I think it's like the last day of school.

It's gonna sink in later, you know.

See you later, guys!


All right!
(Applause)

Romances are very divided.

You know, a lot of people... why?

A lot of people love, uh...

No. Who do they love?

Like, Liam and Naomi.

Oh, really?

And then a lot of people
like Liam and Annie.

Oh. No, I don't think so.


(Tegan and Sara) * all I wanna get is *

â™ª a little bit closer â™ª

â™ª all I wanna know â™ª

Mmm. No. No.

Friends don't date friends' ex-boyfriends.

You know, honestly, my favorite parts

are just the... playing the relationships

between the... the regulars.

We've kind of all taken
turns dating one another.

And then it was just sex, sex, sex.

Sex everywhere. Sex all the time.

Uh, yeah. I've had every guy.

So...
Yeah, you have.

â™ª It's not just all physical â™ª

â™ª I'm the type who won't
get oh, so critical â™ª

â™ª So let's make things physical â™ª

â™ª I won't treat you like
you're oh, so typical â™ª

You and me in the storage room right now.

The... the relationship that
Dixon and Silver had, um,

that first season,

it was the epitome of what teen love is.

I wanted to get something
permanent to symbolize our love.

Like, it literally was...

Sex tapes in the closet.

You filmed us having sex?
What's wrong with you?

It's that first love that... that you feel.

You know, it's that desperation.

It's that, like, raw teen love.

It's okay. I'm here, and
I'm gonna help you get help.

â™ª It's not just all physical â™ª

When I think about the show,

I always think of Navid and Adrianna

'cause we were together

for, like, three out of the five seasons.

<i>Okay, I... I know I am a lot of drama</i>

<i>and I... I just didn't think... (Sighs)</i>

that you liked me.

<i>Well, I do.</i>

No one can compete with you.


â™ª I want you close, I want you â™ª

â™ª I won't treat you like you're typical â™ª


And fans get really attached,
which is cool, you know?

Yeah. But at the same time,

they get very upset when you break up.
(Laughs) (Laughs)

The fans seem to love Liam and Annie.

When I heard that you were in the hospital,

I just... I felt like my
heart stopped or something.

If you weren't okay, then...

I wouldn't be okay.

I've loved you...

for a long time.

â™ª All I wanna know is â™ª

â™ª can you come a little closer? â™ª

I think it was fun

whenever we would put
two characters together

who hadn't been together to
sort of see what would happen.

Like, I don't think anybody
expected Dixon and Adrianna

to get together.

Are we a couple?

Or... or did you just
have sex with me in Vegas

just to keep me away from drugs?

And I think we really enjoyed
and all the writers enjoyed

Silver and Liam.

Silver, wait. We need to talk.

I think we could be great together.

Liam...
No, no, let me finish.

I let you walk away

because I thought I needed
to be everything for you.

And the truth is, I don't
want a baby right now.

<i>But I do want you.</i>

I think the fans of... of Annie and Liam

didn't enjoy it as much.

Look, Liam...

I just wanna jump his
bones every time I see him.


We have this connection.

I... I'm sorry. Is this
weird to talk to you about?

Yeah.

Always wanted to put Navid with Naomi.

a couple more episodes,

and we could have made that happen.

Although it does seem
like everybody might...

sleep with everybody,

or, you know, someone is
punching someone in the face...

(Both grunt) (Camera shutter clicks)

You know, but that's what friends do.

We're a very resilient
group of kids. (Laughs)

Like, we forgive each other really easily.

Man, I swear, I will never let a girl

come between me and a friend again.

Bro code.

I feel like they showed, like,
a really real kind of side

to friendships and relationships,

and it has its ups and downs,

but at the end of the day...
Mm-hmm.

We're all friends, and we're still friends.

Mm-hmm.
And we got through everything together.

This is just the greatest...

as a group of actors.

They're great to work with.
They're great to work with.

And it is, like, a little group of friends

and cool people that
you wanna hang out with.

I was always inspired by
how they were off camera

and wanted to sort of capture some of that

natural effervescence.

This is a serious amount of time that...

that I've spent with these people

in the last five years.

And... and I haven't spent this much time

with anybody else that's in my, you know,

close life right now because
I live at "90210" I know.

of the stuff that we had to do...

the photo shoots, the flying everywhere...

it was like a fraternity or a sorority.

It kind of forged us as a family.

Like so much so, that
whenever there was anybody new,

like... and I'm sorry, Matt,

and, Lowndes, when you see this, I'm sorry,

but, you know, you guys
were outcasts at first.

Like, we really... we really had to,

like, make sure that you
were okay to be a part

of the family kind of thing.



It took years to really figure out

where we all fit into each other's lives.

We've had our ups and our downs,

but we are the only ones
who have ever experienced

what we experienced,

and, like, for that, it's
our story. It's our family.

We've all come to a place
where we know exactly where

each of us fit into that family,

and it is... I always say it's like

a dysfunctional functioning family.

Yeah. (Laughs) (Laughs)

We put the "fun" in dysfunction.
Yeah.


Steger is... (Speaks indistinctly)

Is the goofball of the group. He...

I call him a puppy dog.

This is sweet Steger.
He's all cute and cuddly.

No, no, no. There's a sexy Steger

that came out one day...
Yeah, I don't know what she's talking about.

(Speaks indistinctly)

(Speaks indistinctly)
What are you talking about?

I'm so uncomfortable. Right?

I feel totally uncomfortable.
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

And now, the CW's "Whose
Line Is It Anyway?"

takes a look back at 90210.

Hi, I'm Aisha Tyler, host of the
new "Whose Line is it Anyway?"

premiering this summer on the CW.

And this is a very special 90210 addition

of your game Scenes From a Hat.

So, over to Ryan Styles,

Colin Mochrie, Wayne Brady and
special guest Jonathan Mangum,

to give us some deleted scenes

from 90210. Take it away.

Just gotta study.



Son, I'm so disappointed in you

I can't show it because my botox
has just rendered me completely...


Ok, then, it's decided. For the next
year, we're all gonna be celibate!


Oh my God...

I'm in 90211!


Hi guys.

I'm a mature student.


Hey, I'm the other black guy.


You took mine.

Heyyy! I'm the 9021-"ho".


"Whose Line Is It Anyway?"

summer premiere Tuesday, July 16 on the CW.

You know what's funny?

I was actually talking to, uh,
one of the producers last night.

She was, like, you guys have no idea.

Shows aren't like this.

People don't get along this
well and care this much.

So, uh, so I know we were really lucky.

â™ª

(Amplified voice) Please
welcome back to the stage...

the one, the only Adrianna Tate-Duncan.

â™ª The last time, the last time â™ª

â™ª of something new â™ª

Today we're finishing the final scene

for, um, series finale.

â™ª Guess I never got over you â™ª

(song ends, audience cheering)

(Clank, electricity crackles)

Adriana has just had a
stage collapse on her,

so we're underneath some rubble.


Don't give it all away! (Laughs)

God, you just ruined the whole series.
(Slaps papers)

â™ª

news that the show was ending,

I went on Twitter and I
was letting everyone know,

and one of my fans said, "it's
really cool how Aannalynne

is talking to us like
we've been her friends

for the last five years".

And I thought that that
was really, really cool,

because I do want our fans to feel like

they've been Naomi Clark and Annie Wilson's friends.
Yeah.

Like, they've been with us on this journey,

and... and I want them to
feel that personal connection.

I hope people who watched, um,

are left with, you know, good memories,

that it was a cool piece of history,

a cool piece of our times.

<i>This place definitely doesn't suck.</i>

I hope that kids kind of feel that.

Yeah. I mean, you know,

if they cry a little, I won't be upset.

(Both laugh)

We made it through, didn't we?


When we wrapped our first
actor a few days ago,

which was, like, no, this can't be.

This can't be over. This
is actually happening.

Getting to work on "90210"
was about getting to work

with all these people
who were all contributing

to this crazy, crazy world.

It's something that
I'm really grateful for.

We have all had some
really great times together.

I want people to, you know, feel like

they grew up with us, too, you know? And...
Yeah.

And have fond memories and stuff like that,

that mark a generation.

I think it's great that,

you know, fans have been able
to have "90210" for 5 years,

and some, you know, probably
started high school with us

and graduated high school with us.

Look at as... the beginning
of the rest of our lives.


To the fans that have been
there for all five seasons,

uh, I love you, and I appreciate you,

and I'm so happy that
you were a part of it,

and I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.

(Tamar Kaprelian) *
there's something pure *

â™ª about this feeling â™ª

None of this would have been possible

without your loyalty and
without you guys tuning in.

I'm so glad that, um, we got to share

five seasons with you.

â™ª So I think that you
should move to California â™ª

It's all because of you,
and thank you so much.

â™ª Where the streets are
lit, the sky is, too â™ª

Adrianna will always be a part of me,

and I hope she will always
be a part of you as well.

That's the main thing that
I want everybody to take away

from this show, is that
you guys are family.

It's an amazing feeling to
know that there are people

who are... who are loyal
to the work that you do.

You know, we wouldn't
be here without the fans,

so I hope each and every one of you knows

that... that we care about you

and that you're very special to us.

â™ª So I think that you
should move to California â™ª

â™ª Where the streets are
lit, the sky is, too â™ª

â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh, 'cause where you are â™ª

I would like to say to everybody

just thank you so much
for your endless support,

so thank you, guys, for always being there.

* In California, skies are always blue *
(Laughs)

How you doing?
We did it.

Love you, bro.
Love you, too, man.
