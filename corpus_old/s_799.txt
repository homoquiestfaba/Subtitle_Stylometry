Idiots.

Take the captain beyond the reef till
we get permission to bring him ashore.

For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face
of stupid, suicidal danger.

If we don't get him to a doctor,
he will die.

Do you understand?
Of course I understand.

Just don't expect me to do this sober.
Right.

English dragoons.

Hello!

Dantes, don't.

A little careless, don't you think?
We have to talk to someone.

Well, I know, but...

We're French sailors!

We seek medical attention!
Come on. Come on.

We come in peace.
Edmond, come on!

We mean no harm!
Edmond!

Come on! Climb!

Look out!

Fernand!

Lieutenant Graypool.

If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools...

then by all means shoot them.

But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

Sir, I am Edmond Dantes...

second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego...

son of the Count Mondego.

Our captain has contracted brain fever,
so we put in here for help.

If his coma is genuine,
he won't feel my knife point, will he?

Only a scratch.

Edmond!

Lieutenant Graypool!
We came to you in good faith!

That's for my wounded men.
And wounded pride, no doubt.

It has been an eventful evening.

If I hadn't have shot those dragoons,
you might by lying in pieces
on the beach right now.

I almost got us killed.
Yes, you did.

Yet, we survive.

King's to you, Mondego.

Being your friend
is always an adventure.

Yes, it is, isn't it?

It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

What?

Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

What are you talking about?
Nothing. Drink up.

We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes...

I wonder if I might have
a word with you.

Oh, it's just something
we've done since childhood.

Um, whenever one of us has had
a victory, king of the moment.

King of the moment?
Yes.

In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

He is my captain
and my friend, Your Majesty.

Loyal friends are rare indeed.

In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

I have written a rather
sentimental letter
to an old comrade in Marseilles.

It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

And since they have a habit
of opening my mail...

I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

Oh, I-I don't...

It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

But more important, it is the price
I demand for the use of my physician.

Then I agree.
Good.

You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

Can you remember that name?
Monsieur Clarion.

Now, I do not wish this letter's
existence to be known to anyone else.

Not even your boon companion
back there. Do you understand?

I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

What did he want?

Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

Time you were on your way. Your
captain has been dead for half an hour.

Are you sure?

you can feel death.

Kings and pawns, Marchand.

Emperors and fools.

Come about! Come about!

Drive faster.

Danglars, what's happened?

Captain Reynaud is dead, sir...

and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

Will you be needing me,
Monsieur Morell?

Go.

Mercedes.

Where is he? Where is Edmond?
How lovely to see you too.

You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

Is this true?

I accept all responsibility.

As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

It should have
been your idea.

Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

I was protectin' the merchandise.
You were protecting yourself...

by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

You presume to demote me?

There is no demotion.

Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

who will want
to hear this news.

Thank you.

Monsieur Morell?

I understand you had a ship just
returned from Elba, monsieur.

Yes.
Did anyone aboard...

get ashore there by any chance?

They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

Thank you, monsieur.

May I say who has called upon them?
Clarion.

The name is Clarion.

Make love to me.
Will you ever give up?

He doesn't have to know.
I'd know.

So would I.

It'd be our little secret.
I don't believe in secrets.

You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

I know what you want, Fernand.
You do?

Remember when we were little kids
and Edmond got that whistle for his
birthday, and you got a pony?

Well, you were so mad that Edmond
was happier with his whistle
than you were with your pony.

And I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

How long do you think it's gonna be
before he can afford a wife?

Two years.
Two years. That's all.

Then he gets his captain's papers,
and we can marry.

Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything...

particularly a bride like you.

Hey!

There he is.
Hey!

Whoo!
Mercedes!

I missed you so.

The missing is over now.

Are you in trouble?
No. I'm captain. Come on.

Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

Edmond!

King's to me.

Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

Come on.

You're still the best man.
I know.

Come on!

Stop that.
You'll go bald.

Do you keep secrets from me?
Secrets? No.

Why?

Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

We don't have to wait
two years any more.

As soon as I can afford
the ring, we'll wed...
I don't need a ring. I don't.

This will be my ring.
And no matter what happens...

Ever.

Care to join me?

So tell me, Mondego...

how did you ever
become friends...

with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

He claims to be my friend...

yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

What secrets?

To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

All I am I owe to you, Father.

May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
I am.

Edmond Dantes, you are under arrest by
order of the magistrate of Marseilles.

Arrest?
On what charges?

That information is privileged.
Take him.

I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

Traitor?

Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

Did you have any personal contact
with Napoleon when you were on Elba?

Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

I was with the Count Mondego's son,
Fernand, almost the entire time.

Do you know Fernand?
He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

Oh, there you are.
H-He'll vouch for me.

No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

Except for when Napoleon...

asked me to deliver a personal letter
to a friend in Marseilles.

Well, Dantes, it is for accepting
that treasonous correspondence...

What?
Now, did you deliver the letter?

It's... It's still in my jacket. Here.

Have you read this?
No, sir, I-I can't read.

Well, Dantes, this is a letter
to one of Napoleon's agents.

It gives the times and the locations
of the British beach patrols on Elba.

Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

He swore its contents
were innocent.

No.

It's you that's innocent.

Foolish and innocent.

I believe these are the worst charges
that could be levelled against you.

Fortunately, as I've intercepted this
document, there's no harm done.

God knows how you're going to survive
in this world, Edmond Dantes.

But you are no traitor.

You may go.

Thank you, sir.

Wait, uh, did Napoleon tell you
who's supposed to pick up the letter?

Monsieur Clarion.

What... What name
did you say?

Monsieur Clarion.

Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

Monsieur Mondego or anyone?

No, sir. In fact, Monsieur Mondego
knows nothing of this letter.

This is very dangerous
information.

One can never be too careful
in times like this.

Don't you think?
Yes, sir.

Mm-hmm.

I've given you rather
a stressful time.

I wonder if, by way of an apology,
I could offer you my carriage home.

It's just through here.

Thank you.

Monsieur Villefort?
Monsieur Villefort?

Monsieur Villefort!

Whoa. Whoa!

Where are you taking me?

This is a mistake.

I'm allowed to go home.

From now on, your home is
the prison Chateau d'If.

No! No!

Hey!

Shoot him now!

Mount up!
Get after him!

Fernand!

Fernand!
Monsieur?

It's all right. He's right here.
Fernand!

I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

It was to one of his agents.

Uh, somehow the authorities found out.
I don't... I don't know what to do.

There's gendarmes on horseback
right behind me.

All right. We just have to think.
I hope I haven't compromised you.

I was hoping
your father could help me.
He's in Paris. He's very ill.

How far back are the gendarmes?
Minutes.

Do you need money?
Yes, thank you.

Do you have a pistol?
Of course not.
Good.

Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

It was you?
Well, it wasn't just me.

Well, why did you keep it
a secret from me?

I thought you were my friend.
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.

He lied to me!

I know, Edmond.
I read the letter.

You... You read...

Why are you doing this?

Oh, it's complicated.

Complicated.

Don't be ridiculous.

Get out of my way.
I can't let you go, Edmond.

Get away from the window.

Don't make me
take off your hand!

Why? In God's name, why?

Because you're the son of a clerk!

And I'm not supposed
to want to be you.

In here!
In here!

Get!
Wait.

Hold it. Hold it.

To remember better days.

Come on!

I told you it wasn't always
gonna be this way, Edmond.

Father!

Where is he?
The study.

Wh-What's he done now?
Now, you listen to me, Father.

And I cannot afford to have my own
father mixed up in treasonous affairs!

You know...

in the end,
treason is a matter of dates.

And I shall be the patriot...

and you the traitor,
when the emperor returns.

Stop it. Stop it, you old ruin.
Those days are over.

Napoleon Bonaparte is no longer
the emperor of anything.

And if you continue to dabble
in this lunacy...

you run an excellent chance
of being arrested
and ruining our entire family...

All because of your idiotic sympathies.
At least I have sympathies.

For God's sake, Father,
all Valentina is saying...

is that as a family,
our fates are intertwined.

Surely you can see that.
See? Ah!

I'm an old ruin.

I don't see as well as I did.
You will excuse me.

Move it.

Move.

Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'If.

Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal...

but I assure you I am innocent.

Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

Innocent.
Yes.

I know. I really do know.

You mock me?
No, my dear Dantes.

I know perfectly well
that you are innocent.

Why else would you be here?

If you were truly guilty...

there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away...

but Chateau d'If is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

"God will give me justice."

People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

Or they keep calendars,
but soon they lose interest or they die.

There's a window.

And all I'm left with is a rather
unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment...

we hurt them.

Usually just
a simple beating, really.

I like to do
something rather special.

And if you're thinking just now,
"Why me, O God? "

The answer is...
All right?

God has nothing to do with it.

In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

All right.

Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
What?

Landed 100 miles from here.
He marches on Paris!

We are here to plead the case...

Of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.
Not now! Dantes?

We have not met, monsieur.

I am Fernand Mondego,
the son of Count Mondego.

And I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

Yet you stand by him?
Of course I do.

What if I was to tell you that Dantes
is also charged with murder?

Murder?
Edmond would never do such a thing.

Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents...

and when we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

No, if you knew him, monsieur,
you would know that was not possible.

Have mercy, please.
You have proof of this treason?

Well, that is government business.
Please.

Please, just tell us where he is.

I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

But my advice to all of you would be
to forget Edmond Dantes...

particularly you,
mademoiselle.

Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

and perhaps some good may yet
come of this unhappy affair.

Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

My son is no traitor!
I will try to reason with him further.

Safely leave this to Fernand.
Never. It's impossible.

He can plead the case.
Never.

I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

I will never
forget your kindness.

And I shall never
cease to give it.

Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes...

but still, murder?

It's quite simple really.

When you reported Dantes'
receiving the letter to me...

I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him.

What prompts you to be
so accommodating?

Sit down, Mondego.

No!

Come back!

Come back!

What's my crime?
What's my crime?

I'm innocent!

Happy anniversary, Dantes.

Until next year.

Has it really been
four years, Delius?

Or Danton?
What is his name again?

Forgive my intrusion.

But I was under
the impression that I...

I was digging
toward the outer wall.

I am Abbe Faria.

I have been a prisoner
in Chateau d'If for 11 years.

Five which have been spent...

digging this tunnel.

There are 72,519 stones
in my walls.

I've counted them many times.

But have you
named them yet?

Once I was as you are now.

But I promise, it will pass.

I promise, I promise. Now...

may I stand
on your shoulders?

Take me down.

Please, take me down now.
Take me down.

I have not seen the sky
these 11 years. Thank you.

Thank you, God.

There is no talk of God
in here, Priest.

What about the inscription?

It's faded, just as God
has faded from my heart.

And what has replaced it?
Revenge.

Hold these.

Follow me.

Perhaps your thoughts
of revenge...

are serving God's purpose of
keeping you alive these seven years.

To what end?
Escape.

There we go.

You spoke of escape.

Yeah.

There are only two possibilities
of reaching the outer wall...

I simply...
I simply chose the wrong one.

Now, of course, with two of us,
we could dig in the opposite direction.

And with both of us together,
then, of course, we could
possibly do it in, um...

oh, eight years.

Oh, does something else
demand your time?

Some pressing appointment,
perhaps?

In return for your help,
I offer something priceless.

My freedom?

No, freedom can be taken away,
as you well know.

I offer knowledge,
everything I have learned.

I will teach you, oh,
economics, mathematics...

Philosophy, science.
To read and write?

Of course.

When do we start?

I got it. I got it.

Lights out. Lights.

Let's have 'em. Come on.
The slot opens twice a day.

Once for your toilet bucket,
which is where we hide the dirt.

Come on.

And once in the evening
for your plate.

Lights out. Out.

Come on, Priest.

Thank you.

Between those times we can work all day
without fear of discovery.

"So neglect becomes...

our ally."

Excellent.

So you were in
Napoleon's army.

We had such dreams then.

However, one night...

my regiment ran down...

a band of guerrillas...

who ran into a church
for sanctuary.

I was ordered
to burn down the church...

with them inside it.

Did you?

To my everlasting shame, I did.

I did.

How did you come to be here?

The following day
I deserted...

to devote my life to repentance
and to God.

I worked as
private secretary to...

the enormously wealthy
Count Enrique Spada.

Spada was a righteous man.

Sadly, a couple
of years later, he died...

amidst rumours that he had
hidden his limitless fortune.

Two weeks later, I was arrested.
Why?

Napoleon wanted
Spada's treasure.

He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

And so here I've remained...

with only God for company...

until he sent me you.

God is no more real
than your treasure, Priest.

Perhaps.

Hurry. Get it.

Compute this.

2,500 cubic centimetres
of rock and dust a day...

for 365 days.

Equals three-and-a-half
metres a year...

twelve feet, a foot a month.

Three inches a week.

In Italian.

Do not waste the light.

You were a soldier, Priest.

So you know weaponry.

Teach me.

Or dig alone.

This is ridiculous.

The stronger swordsman
does not necessarily win.

It is speed!

Speed of hand.

Speed of mind.

Now, sweep your hand
through the drops...

without getting wet.

Like this.

How long must I keep this up?

I am going down the tunnel.

Parry.

Up. Like that.

Economics is the science
that deals with the production...

distribution and
consumption of commodities.

Translation.

Thank you.
Happy Christmas, Edmond.

Give or take a month or so.

Danglars? Mondego?
Who do you think?

Good! Too good.

We have Newton's third law.

There is a reaction
to every action...

in physics and in man.

Thus my quest for vengeance
is a reaction to the actions
of Danglars and Mondego.

Up, up.
I want that seat.

You once told me that Villefort
had you rearrested just after...

he had cleared you
of all the charges.

You may go.

Yes, that's true.

Then why would he go
through that charade...

unless he had reason to change his mind
about letting you go?

Think, Edmond.
I'm trying.

What happened?
He asked me...

Did Napoleon tell you who was
supposed to pick up this letter?

I told him...
A Monsieur Clarion.

And nothing more?
Nothing. He burnt the letter
and said I could go.

Ah.

He burned the letter.

Yes.
Strange that a chief magistrate...

would burn evidence
of a treasonous conspiracy...

and then
imprison the only man...

who was aware of
Monsieur Clarion's connection...

to that conspiracy.

He was protecting someone.
Ah.

A dear friend perhaps?
No. No.

A politician like Villefort would have
rid himself of such friends.

Clarion could be a relative.

A close relative, possibly...

No!

Villefort's father was
a colonel in Napoleon's army.

Villefort wasn't protecting Clarion.

He was protecting himself.

Danglars, who falsely said he saw
Napoleon give me that letter.

Mondego,
who told Villefort I had it.

And Villefort himself,
who sent me here.

Bravo, Edmond, bravo.

Oh, my God. Oh, oh.

Oh.

Edmond, light. Light.
Quick. Light.

Oh, please, God.
What is that? Look.

Look. Look!
Roots. Plant roots.

If these are plant roots,
then we are only months away.

Yes. Well done, Priest.
I'll get my chisel.

Good. Good.

Priest!

In God's name, go on.

Go on. Go on!

Lungs are punctured.

Don't talk.
Listen.
Don't talk.

There's not much time.

Under th-those books,
there's loose rocks.

Quickly, quickly.

Open it.
When I told them I did not know...

where the treasure of Spada was,
I lied.

You lied?

I'm a priest, not a saint.

There, on that island
off the Italian coast.

Monte Cristo?
Yes, yes.

Use... Use your head.

Follow the clues.
The tunnel's blocked.

I can't escape.
Keep digging.

When you escape,
use it for good, only for good.

No, I will surely
use it for my revenge.

Do not commit...

Oh. Do not commit the crime...

for which you now
serve the sentence.

God said, "Vengeance is mine."
I don't believe in God.

That doesn't matter.

He believes in you.

Priest?

Plates out.

Let's have it.

Oh.

Oh, God.

He's always awake.

First time in 12 years
he hasn't said "Thank you."

Dead.
How?

Fell off his bed, didn't he?

He's a bit dirty, isn't he?
They all are.

Well, let's sew him up...

and then see Dorleac.

One, two, three.

Right, let's get Dorleac.

Why'd you lock it?
He's not going anywhere.

I don't know.
Habit, I suppose.

Goodbye, Priest.

You're free now...

as I will never be.

Well, bring him along.

Let's bury him, then.
You ready?

Yeah.
One. That's it.

Keep going.
Come on, come on.
I haven't got all day.

Actually, I do.

I've got... I've got...

all the time in the world!

Come on.

Come on.

Monsieur Dorleac!

Heavenly Father,
we bequeath to you...

these remains of your humble servant.

Whatever his name was.
God, I'm so bored.

Monsieur Dorleac!

Did he, in fact, have a map?

No, gov.
Where's the, uh...

Stop!

Monsieur Dorleac!

What do you mean, after three?
We throw him at three or before three?

After three.
One, two...

Monsieur Dorleac!
And th...

Don't, Monsieur Dorleac!
One...

Two...
Don't throw the body over the cliff!

three!

We could have handled that
a bit better.

Thank you, Priest.

Thank you.

So, mi amice, I would ask who you are,
but in view of your shredded clothes...

and the fact that the Chateau d'If
is two miles away...

what's the point?

As for me, I am Luigi Vampa...

a smuggler and a thief.

My men and I have come to this island
to bury alive one of our number...

who attempted to keep
some stolen gold for himself...

instead of, uh,
sharing it with his comrades.

Interestingly enough, there are
some of his more loyal friends...

who are insisting
that I grant him mercy...

which, of course, I cannot do,
for I would quickly lose control...

of the whole crew.

You provide me with a way
to show a little mercy to Jacopo...

that maggot you see
tied up over there...

while, at the same time,
not appearing weak.

And as a special treat, the lads
will get to see a little sport as well.

How do I accomplish all this?

If Jacopo wins,
we welcome him back to the crew.

If you win, I have given Jacopo
the chance to live...

even if he did not
take advantage of it...

and you can take his place
on the boat.

What if I win,
and I don't want to be a smuggler?

Then we slit your throat,
and we're a bit shorthanded.

to kill your friend, the maggot.

Perhaps you should get out more.

Release Jacopo
and give him back his knife.

Then we let the games begin.

Get up, maggot.

Come on, come on!

As you hope to live,
do not move an eyelash.

Senor Vampa, allow Jacopo to live.

He's already suffered enough with
the prospect of being buried alive.

The men that wanted
to see some sport have seen it.

Those who wanted mercy for Jacopo
will get it.

And by keeping me and Jacopo...

It's a deal.
What is his name?

You've got the devil, Jacopo!
His name?

We shall call him Zatarra.

Sounds fearsome.

It means "driftwood."

I swear on my dead relatives,
even on the ones...

that are not feeling too good...

I am your man forever.

I know.

Eyes in the back of your head.

Have you never seen
Marseilles before?

It was my home.

But you do not join the others ashore.
Over here!

Yeah, that's right, over here!

Listen to me, Zatarra.
Whatever happened to you...

you cannot make it right
by staying here on this boat.

Go. It's up to you.

"We are kings or pawns,"
a man once said.

Si. Who told you this?

Napoleon Bonaparte.

Bonaparte?

Oh, Zatarra, the stories you tell.

A man is always in need
of a good friend.

Truly.

Danglars, what's happened?

Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,
and Edmond Dantes disobeyed my orders.

Zatarra, are you all right?

Everything's changed.

I want you to buy a boat,
just something the two of us can handle.

Wait for me to return.
I make my next visit alone.

Is... Is this the home
of Monsieur Morell?

My grandfather isn't well, monsieur.

Even if he were, he would not receive
visitors at 11:00 in the evening.

Perhaps he might make an exception for
a man who is seeking E-Edmond Dantes.

I apologize for the hour.

Old people never sleep. Sit down,
sit down. Julianne, some sherry.

So, Monsieur Zatarra...

you were a friend of Edmond?

Monsieur Morell?
Yes?

You knew Edmond also?

Like a son.

Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

after learning of Edmond's treason.

I see.

I see. And...

this treason you speak of...

Who accused him?
Who knows?

Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested...

left for Paris soon after to take up
the post of chief prosecutor.

Of course, the shock of
his father's violent murder...

may also have spurred his departure.

They were strange times.

After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

One of my captains.

And then one day,
Danglars forced me out.

My-My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

Perhaps your luck is about to change.

You mean the Countess Mondego?

Countess?
Yes.

A month after
poor Edmond was arrested...

Mercedes wed his best friend.

Fernand.
Yes, that's right.

And with the death of
his father and brother in the war...

Fernand became Count Mondego.

They live in Paris now.

Count and Countess Mondego.

Are you all right?

Yes. I must go.

I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
Oh, no.

You told me what I needed to know.

Edmond Dantes is dead.

Zatarra. Zatarra,
you will be so proud of me.

I found a nice little skiff.
We couldn't afford a sloop.

Got a really good deal.
Za-Zatarra? Zatarra.
