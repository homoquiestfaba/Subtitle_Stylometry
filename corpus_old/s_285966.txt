I looked up all the documents from
before you were adopted.

Before you were adopted,

you were reported as an orphan.

I went to the neighborhood and asked around.

Luckily, there was a woman who remembered you.

Thank you very much.
I'll never forget your help.

Hey, you bitch!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

Pay up...
Let go, you bitch!

Why you, bitch!
You're stealing a zipper that's only a dollar?

Is this the way you sew on a zipper?

Of course, this is the way!
How else, bitch?

She's the one I told you about!

Ugh...dumb, fat bitch...huh.

Scratching a person's face like this.

Hello.

This is the man I told you about.

Then...this is...Jin-woo?
Yes.

I wanted to see you because

there's something you should know.

Sit, sit here.

I was hoping to have this time with you some day.

It's a long story...

Today, commentator Bang speaks
about the Kwangjoo incident.

Hello. This is Young-jin Bang

Today, I'd like to talk about

the military that has entered Kwangjoo.

The difficulties the military had

in stabilizing the crisis is well known.

The military under martial law worked hard

to bring it under control.

It is well understood that it was

hard for the military to protect

the innocent majority of Kwangjoo
who are citizens of this country.

Thus the army acted cautiously.

We will not forget their endeavors.

The Martial Law headquarters released

its report on the Kwangjoo riot today.

According to the report,

there were 33 main instigators,

30 who attacked the prisons,
33 looters who also set fires,

174 who left the main party,
10 who spread rumors,

and 74 who participated in demonstrations or riot

"The river is flowing...Underneath
the Third Han Bridge..."

Hey

Did you see the guy who moved
into the second floor?

He looks real elegant

His fingers are white and really long

What good are pretty hands, you fool

Look at Kyung-chul. He easily makes
10 bucks a day.

Ugh...whatever. Who cares if he's a good worker

You crazy bitch!
Then what's great about pretty hands?

What's he gonna use them for

You haven't got a clue...A fool,
that's what you are.

Ki-ok, all you do is curse

Stop it.

It's irritating.

Huh! Am I wrong?

It's not like his thing is pretty.

Who cares about his hands, right?

Ki-ok! You do know something, don't you?

You go, girl!

Ugh...I'm sick of this neighborhood

I've gotta get out of here.

So let's get out together, okay?

They say the discomfort index is high today.

But I can't tell.

Just like I don't know about pleasure,

I don't know about discomfort either.

I'm just used to this space.

I couldn't take such humid weather before.

But once you get used to it,
it feels comfortable.

That's life for me.

The fact that there's nothing for me
to do is also comfortable.

I just have to live.

It's okay to just feel alive every now and then

So many fucking bills.
And no one who cares. Damnit...

You should've told me before if it fell out

You gotta take care of these things right away

I fixed it good now.

When are you going to paint this?
Soon.

Damnit! Get over here!
Oh...at it again, those crazyfools.

Hurry, it's your move

Why are you so slow

What kind of move is that

Who says you're a great player,huh?
Move your 'cha, cha,'...

What do you mean 'cha?' I win if I do this

Give it, give it

The girls at the teahouse in front

they smoke really cool.

How

Look at you..

But where do you hide your ciggies?
My cigarettes?

Wo

Plan on working at a match factory

Let me see.
What the hell...

Damnit! I stepped on shit! Fuck

What's the ring for

You know. It's Detective Im's son's first birthday

He has all the luck

Gets promoted..

You know what

I think I'm gonna get my job back soon

They know I took the fall for them

that I didn't do it.

Just wait a little.
They said they'd call me back

Our troubles are over

We'll live like we used to

I'm confident

Just be patient

We'll get out of this shitty neighborhood...

"Who said love was beautiful..."

"Rather, rather...Put me to sleep with
your empty hands."

I went to a friend's house yesterday

His sister was sleeping

I put my hands under her skirt

Crazy bastard

Who the hell

I'll kill you

You! It was you, right? Stupid bastard

Look! Look! Crazy bastard...Damnit..

Shit

Who put this..

Wait till I get my hands on you..

Fresh cabbages

Fresh cabbages from Kangwon

If I catch the bastard,
I'll stick his head in the can.

What kind of sick pig peeks at that?
Exactly.

Hey, are you talking to us

Mr. Park, I beg you,
change the bathroom door.

Why me

Plus, today's a holiday.
Why'd you come here?

Why don't you go use your own bathroom...

I won't mention names but there's a pric

who's ruining the neighborhood

You can't even take a dump
in our own neighborhood.

When I catch him, I'll fuck his life up good

What? Fuck his life up?
Don't talk like that, Ki-ok

Fuck up his life cause he saw her take a dump

Is that a thing to say

I'm not being mean.
That's how the world is today.

Say the wrong thing and they'll tear you apart

Peeking into the bathroom,
that's a crime! A big one!

I'm...I'm... Young-mi

What was that in the papers a few days back

Immoral behavior?

The thing that they're trying to set an example with?

That's it! Immoral behavior!
Set an example.

What? What? What'd you say

Well, you know...l don't wanna be

to mean living in the same neighborhood.

But there's a bastard who doesn't seem to get it

And if that's the case,
you're part of the problem, too.

Boy, you're so smart, aren't you

I don't get a word you said.

What? Set what

Set an example!
You don't need to get it all.

If you don't want to be dragged of

and tortured then watch out.

It's a scary world right now

Let's go. Peeking into the bathroom...

What? What? Torture?
Man...She's so full of herself...

These mosquitoes are driving me crazy

Why aren't you sleeping? Come here

I'm gonna steam some yams

Don't pee there. Go overthere

"My love who has left me"

"if I could only meet him today..."

"With my tired lips, I can tell you all about it."

Where is everybody

"...I've lived, unaware of the world."

How far are you going to follow me

Wanna go see the circus?
I happen to have two tickets.

No thanks

Can I see your place?
No!

Oh...how about tomorrow night at 8

Okay

"The river is flowing..."

Cut it out

"I'm so...fucking embarrassed."

Hey! What is that

Do we always gotta listen to country

Let's get some culture.

Crazy bastard. Do you even know the title

You making fun of me

It was as popular as Paul Anka, Diana

Do you even know that

"I'm so...fucking embarrassed."

Sure, no matter what you spit out

no bitch here can understand you.

We have nothing to do with English
except for 'thank you.'

What

What

I'm telling you it's something like Diana

Are you crazy? Hey

Polka Inca, Diamond, whatever

what the hell are you throwing at me

Damnit... Hey! Pick that up! Pick it up

Well...you were laughing at me...That's why..

I'm out of here

Hey! Where are you going

What are the torture camps doing?
Not taking that one...

What did you say? Bitch...

You brat, you out of your mind

We've a big load to send out in two days

Did you even do your job

Kyung-chul.
Yes.

Is this a dance hall

What are you doing

Stop being full of yourself and

undo these stitches, will ya?

I'm sorry. It's just that..

...you're so beautiful.

It was you the last time too, wasn't it?

You always look so lonely

Why doesn't your husband look at you

How do you know that

Overthere

I'm sorry I couldn't make it last time

I had to work overtime.

Do you work in the factory out front

I'm just a low-level worker right now

but one day, I'll have my own store

I have a savings account, too. In a few years,
I'll have enough.

I'm different from the people around here

Some thread here...
What are you doing?

It must've gotten there at work. I had to do a lot today

Do I have any on my back

Yes...
Could you take them off?.

Sure
