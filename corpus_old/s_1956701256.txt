I said, drop your gun!

All right.

Take it easy.

What do you want?

Helicopter. Now!

ALPHA ONE [OVER RADIO]:

That's what we fight for, guys.

Oh, man, I need to get home.

No mission too difficult,

ALL MARINES:
Duty first!

MARINE:
That's it! To the hangar.

[MARINE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]

Boss, I'll take that for you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[SEABIRDS CAWING]

You think someday...

just once, you could come back
in the same shape you left?

You don't like my scars?

I don't mind the scars.

I just don't like
the stories they tell.


You know the funny thing
about the stories they tell?

Is they all end the same.

I always come home.

Just saying,

at some point,

your body can't do this forever.

Are you questioning
what my body can and can't do?


Well, maybe I just need
a little reeducation.

[VOLUME DECREASES]

Never gets old.

Who are you?
Who am I?

I'm the bloke
that ruined your vacation.

Name's Martin Axe.

So that's one for you.
Now one for me.

Who tipped you off
about the hostages in Mombasa?

[ROPES CREAK]

Right, yeah.

I thought you might clam up.

That's why I brought
a little extra motivation.



Look who it is.

[AXE CHUCKLES]

[GINA WHIMPERS]

AXE: Who's that?
[WHISPERS] Gina.

AXE:
Hey.

She has nothing to do with this.

[GINA WHIMPERING]

AXE:
Once again, then.

Who tipped you off?

I don't know, man.

That's not my job.
I go where they point me.

[GINA GASPS]

Can she handle all six inches?

Why am I asking you, eh?


Hey, look at me.

Look at me!

I don't... I can't answer
because I don't know.

If I knew, I would tell you!

I don't know!

You could ask me anything,
anything else,

but this I can't tell you
because I don't know.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Yeah, I believe you.

Ray. Ray. Ray.

[GINA CRYING]

Ray.
It's gonna be okay.

[INHALES DEEPLY]

Bad news, baby.

It's not gonna be okay.

No! No!
No, no, no.

[BOLT GUN CLATTERS]

["PSYCHO KILLER"

Oh, you're nothing.

You don't even exist anymore.

I swear, I will find you
and end you!

You should kill me now

because you won't have
a second chance.

I promise you.

[KNOB CLICKS]
[MUSIC SHUTS OFF]

Thanks for the advice.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[HEART MONITOR FLATLINING]

HARTING:
<i>Commence bioelectrical charge.</i>

[MACHINERY CLANKING]

<i>Seventy-five percent.</i>

<i>Full cycle.</i>

[HEART MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY]

<i>Project Bloodshot

<i>transfusion complete.</i>

KT:
Subject awake and is stable.

Hey. Hey, look at me.

Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You're okay.

It's gonna be fine. It's okay.

[MECHANICAL WHIRRING]

Where am I?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[MONITOR BEEPING QUIETLY]

Awake and cognitive.

This is... This is phenomenal.

RAY:
Do I know you guys?

I don't think so.
Welcome to RST,

Rising Spirit Technologies.
I'm Dr. Emil Harting.

This is my facility
and my colleague, KT.

Katie.
Initials, KT.

Will you look at me, please?

Dilation looks good. No sign
of sub-macular hemorrhaging.

There's no redness. Very clear.

All right, what happened to me?
What am I doing here?

Tell me,
do you remember anything?

Anything's kind of broad,
don't you think?

Of course. Let's keep it simple.

What about your name,
rank, serial number?

RAY:
Of course.

My name is...

Rank, serial number?

Yes, your body was donated
by the U.S. military.

My body?

It was either us
or Arlington, I'm afraid.


Arlington, doc?

I got some scars, but I'm not
ready for the cemetery.

I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

but you got yourself killed.

Okay.

I'll play along.

But if I died...

somebody's waiting
for me to call them.

Somebody must be waiting
for me to come home.

Uh...

It's difficult for me
to tell you this. Um...

More difficult than
telling someone they died?

Um...
Well, the military

only anonymously donates
remains of soldiers

who weren't claimed by family.

Sorry. Sometimes you just
gotta rip off the Band-Aid.

Helps to get through the pain
a bit quicker.

But you don't need a history
to have a future.

Listen to me. You're the first

we've successfully managed
to bring back.

And it has worked beautifully.

You have been given something
that nobody else has.

A second chance.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

A second chance.

RAY:
Whoa. Heh.

Ain't what I was expecting.

What are we doing
all the way out here, doc?

[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

RST focuses on rebuilding

the most important asset
in the U.S. military,

soldiers just like yourself.

We are explorers
on a new frontier.

We develop everything
from exoskeletal reconstruction,

which makes soldiers
faster and stronger,

to neural prosthetics, which
enhance the way they react.

But you, my friend,

you are the proof
that we are leading the way

in the greatest human
advancement of all time.

Come, I'll show you.

May I?
Yeah, sure.


The hell, doc?

[ELECTRICAL TRILLING]

RAY:
Holy shit.

HARTING:
Let me explain.

[DEVICE BEEPS]

If you would
place your hand here, please.

Now, look at this.

Now, what the hell
are those things?

Biomechanical constructs.

<i>We call them "nanites."</i>

[NANITES TRILLING]

<i>They intuitively enhance
your biology.</i>

<i>Most notably,
they react very quickly</i>

<i>to catastrophic injury,</i>

<i>rebuilding damaged tissue.</i>

So those are in my blood?
They are your blood.

We had some success applying
them to single organ systems.

We thought it was time to try

a full-body transfusion.
Of course you did.

Just like our own bodies
need calories,

the nanites need
their own energy.

And this lab supplies that.

The more effort they make,

the more energy they consume.

What's that glow?
That's heat being generated

by the nanites
battling malignant cancer,

trying to save that mouse.

The mouse that just died?

Admittedly, some of the early
results were suboptimal.

Maybe we should fast-forward
to the optimal part.

That's you.
You're the optimal part.

Because now we have
the ability to recharge

when they're running low.

Why can't I remember
anything about me?

Because of who you were
and what you did.

Sadly, everything about you
is classified.

And that was all in your past.
This is your future.

Listen, when I was a boy,
I was a tennis champion.

And then when I was 15,
I got cancer.

They took my arm
within six months.

Instead of dwelling
on what I'd lost,

I chose to focus
on who I could become.

[MECHANICAL WHIRRING]

And so now, when a soldier
loses his arm,

he gets a better one.

This is our rehab facility,

where patients come to test the
limits of their augmentations.

You've already met KT,
ex-Navy swimmer.

She was part of
a rescue deployment in Syria

during a chemical attack.

One laryngeal tracheal
reconstruction later

and she now breathes through
a clavicle-mounted respirator.

Makes her totally immune
to inhalants.

Tibbs here graduated

from Fort Benning,
top of his class.

He became one of the Army's
most successful marksmen

until an Iraqi mortar
took his sight.

We've since remedied that
with ocular prosthetics.

Gear-mounted camera arrays feed
directly into his optic nerves.

Which means now he sees...
Everything.

[EYE SCANNER CHIMES]

Welcome to the circus.

And finally, Jimmy Dalton,
ex-Navy SEAL.

Jimmy lost both his feet
to an Afghan IED,

so we engineered him a new set.

Part of Team Six.
Took out bin Laden.

You and every other Navy SEAL.

So we're wounded warriors.

Not wounded.

Improved. Enhanced.

Sounds cool.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Where you going?
Oh, I'm gonna go back to sleep.

Or maybe I'm just gonna wake up.

So, what are
we supposed to do now?

I think we just let him recover.

Jimmy, will you walk him
to his room, please?

Wow, they spared every expense.
When you're done with your nap,

we'll be downstairs
doing our jobs.

Yeah, I don't even know
what my job is.

You'll find out.
When you're ready,

I'll tell you everything.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

RAY:
<i>No!</i>


[EXHALING RHYTHMICALLY]

[NANITES CRACKLING]


[PILLAR CRACKLING]

[NANITES TRILLING]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[MECHANICAL WHIRRING]


You're up late.

Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

You know,
if I was dead yesterday,

I wouldn't be able
to sleep either.

Nah, I had a nightmare.
Which doesn't make any sense.

How can you have a nightmare
if you have no memories?

Trust me.

Soon, you'll remember enough to
wish you could forget it again.

[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

That was pretty amazing
in there.

A kata underwater.

You know...

we're all damaged goods here.

But this is who I am now.

I've embraced it.

Hey, there's something
I want you to have.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I carry it with me all the time.

First time I served
on that ship,

I was the only woman there.

Master chief knew
that I had nobody...

so he wanted to make a point
that I belong.

I'm sure
there's someone out there

who cares about you
a great deal.

You just don't know it yet.

I hope so.

You look like
you could use a drink.

I already know what I like,
so I guess it's time for you

to find out what you like.

Okay, go easy on me.

To new beginnings.

[TALKING HEADS' "PSYCHO KILLER"
PLAYS OVER SPEAKER]

I feel like I've been...
GINA: <i>Ray.</i>

Ray. Ray. Ray.

KT: Are you okay?
<i>Ray.</i>

<i>[GINA LAUGHS]</i>

Hey.

Gina.

Name's Martin Axe.

She has nothing to do with this.
Who?

RAY:
If I knew, I would tell you!

Look at me.

<i>â™ª Psycho killer
Qu'est-ce que c'est? â™ª</i>


I will find you!

I need medical in here now!
Listen to me.

RAY:
<i>Kill me now!</i>

Kill me! Because you won't get
a second chance!

[MUSIC SHUTS OFF]

AXE:
<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

Hey. It's okay.

I'm sorry.
Listen.

Whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

You don't understand, KT.

<i>â™ª Run, run, run away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, oh... â™ª</i>

I know why I'm alone.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[TIRES SCREECHING]

HARTING:
Where are you going?

Where are you go...?
Can he hear me?

Is the channel open?

Eric, open a channel.

ERIC:
And we're live.

HARTING:
<i>Where are you going?</i>

Doc, how are you talking to me?

You have a billion wireless
microprocessors in your brain.

I need you
to come back here right now.

I've got unfinished business.

What are you waiting for?
Go and get him.

We're your only business.
We are the only people you know.

RAY: <i>That's what you told me.
But I had a wife.</i>

And he took her from me.

[TIRES SQUEAL]
[ENGINE REVS]

What are you talking about?
Who did?

Martin Axe.

[ELECTRICAL TRILLING]

[HUMMING, BEEPING]

HARTING:
Eric, get me a terminal window.

[MONITOR CHIMES]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ERIC: His nanites are scanning
the global search platforms.

Wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

You used my tech and scraped
a criminal database.

That is beyond illegal.
I need you to come back now.

<i>This isn't about what you need.</i>

I'm sending Tibbs and Dalton
after you.

They won't stop me.

HARTING:
<i>This is not a-a-a hit job.</i>

<i>It's...
It's a salvage operation,</i>

and you are
a multibillion-dollar prototype.

You're my
multibillion-dollar prototype.

I can't just have you...
<i>Doc! I'm not yours.</i>

<i>Besides, I always come home.</i>

HARTING:
<i>You always come home? What?</i>

Look, we don't know
what you're capable of.

We don't even know
what you can take yet.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Time for a live-fire test.

Hold on. Hold on.
Let's just take a minute.

Think about this.
You don't have money.

You don't have a passport.
Flying private.

ERIC:
One second. He's...

I got him at the hangar.
The Gulfstream?

No, no, no. I mean,
do you even know how to fly?

RAY:
I'll find a way.

HARTING: You'll find a way?
What does that...?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

MERC [OVER RADIO]:
<i>All clear. Time to move.</i>

MERC LEADER:
<i>All right. Radio it in.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>

<i>ETA 20 minutes.</i>

[TIRES SCREECHING]

HARTING:
So how is he tracking him?

Well, it appears
he cross-referenced

every available
auto manufacturing database

with live GPS data to identify
all the cars in the area.

And then he pinged them
one at a time, all 9000 of them.

Why?

To find the five moving
in a convoy.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What the hell's going on?
Team One, check ahead.

[TIRES SCREECH]

[TIRES SQUEALING]

[TIRES SCREECHING]

[METAL CREAKING]

Was that on purpose?

DRIVER: It's blocked.
Really?

AXE:
Guys, was that on purpose?

Team Two, take a look.
See if we can push through.

MERC:
Flour.

Team One's down.

What about the truck driver?

Driver is...

He's gone.
Dead?

No, gone. He's not here.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh, that's not good.

[IGNITION SPUTTERS]

MERC:
He's down, boss.

Thermite. Engine's gone.
AXE: This is not good.

All teams, full sweep.
Eyes on everything.

See if there are more out there.
AXE: We gotta get out of here.

Sit down. My men will handle it.

[RIFLES RACKING]

AXE: No, no, no, guys.
You're not listening!

I need to get
out of this car now!

First, we sweep,
then we switch cars!

Let's take their car.

Oh, man.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[SCREAMING]
[BONES SNAPPING]

Oh!


[MAN YELLS]

Wait, what's that?

[NANITES TRILLING]

Oh, man, it is him.

Shit. Come on, come on, come on.

<i>What?</i>
He's here!

They finished it,
and he's right bloody here!

<i>We all knew he wasn't
gonna let us walk away.</i>

<i>Just let the professionals
we hired handle it.</i>

Oh, sure. Small problem there.
Your guys suck!

<i>Check on Wigans. See
where he is with that thing.</i>

<i>Find out how much longer.</i>

No, no, no.
Don't hang up. Don't...

Oh, I'm screwed!

MERC 1: You see him?
MERC 2: He's in the trailer.

Fire!

Cease fire!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



Bugger me.

Shh, shh. Listen.

He can't get in, can he?
MERC LEADER: Not a chance.

[GLASS SQUEAKS]

[LOCKS CLICK]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Shit.

[NANITES TRILLING]

AXE [DISTORTED]:
Don't, please.

Whatever Harting told you,
it's not true.

No, wait. Don't.
You don't understand.

He's lying to you.
I can help you.

You're making a mistake.

Thanks for the advice.
No!


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

TIBBS:
It's about time.

[BRAKES SQUEAL]

Jesus.

Look what they did to him.

DALTON: Gotta hand it to him.
The guy does damage.

Are you okay?
How you feeling?

I just saw the man
who murdered my wife.

Looked him dead in the eyes

and killed him.

It won't change a thing
because, no matter what,

my wife isn't coming back.

Makes you wonder
if it's all worth it.

Yeah, well, I'm done.

Yeah, I'm done too.

[CLEARS THROAT]

What does that mean?
She means we're all tired, bub.

Gotta get you back to RST,
get you plugged in.

Let's go.

RAY: No one needed
to come collect me.

I told Harting I'd come back.

He sent us to make sure
you get back in one piece.

Looks like we were almost late.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[DOOR WHOOSHES]

What are you doing here, Dal...?

[MACHINE BUZZES, WHIRS]

That's right.

You can't talk.

Truth is...

you aren't at the wheel
of your own body.

We just shoved you aside
to watch

as we shut down
your motor functions.

Look at you.

So angry.

So driven.

[DALTON CHUCKLES]

You think you're the good guy?

That's a goddamn joke.

You're an exhausting shit bird

with a revenge button
we keep pushing.

Much as I hate babysitting you,

cleaning up after you,

this little moment...

this small part right here,
makes it all worthwhile.

Gina.

Sweet Gina.

You really believe she's dead.

Every goddamn time.

There it is.

That look.

The dumbass catches on too late.

Well, I may be an asshole,
but you're the toy soldier.

We wind you up,
point you at the next victim,

put you back in here
and then push this button.

Ready to forget?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[TABLET CHIMES]

Told you
I'd tell you everything.

LIEUTENANT [OVER MONITOR]:
<i>Delta Two. Sitrep.</i>

<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

MARINE [DISTORTED]: <i>Ain't looking good, LT.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

LIEUTENANT: <i>Go for comms, Delta Two.
Sitrep.</i>

DELTA TWO:
<i>Four hostages down.</i>

RAY: <i>Contact, building

"I'm done too"? I'm not sure

what you're trying
to accomplish.

Why does it matter if you're
gonna wipe his memory again?

HARTING: It's not him I'm worried about.
It's you.

Everything we do here
specifically serves a purpose.

The training, the alcohol,
the nightmare.

I know the script.
Well, would you stick to it?

You know that we're compromised.

It doesn't work
if we don't check every box.

What you're doing to him
is not fair and you know it.

If you don't like it,
you're welcome to leave.

Bullshit.
Just like your partners

when they had a problem with it?
Like Baris?

You know the moment
I walk out that door...

I can't breathe.
That's the deal you agreed to.

That's the choice that you made.
Well, he deserves to make his.

is a military funeral.

I'm sure
that's what he's gonna get.

Jesus. You're just gonna
get rid of him?

He's a soldier.
You can't do that.

He's a dead soldier.

He's a dead soldier.

America makes new ones
every day.

Listen, I will let you in
on a little secret.

This is our last one, okay?

And then we go to market

with a technology
that will redefine warfare

for the highest bidder
and then we're done.

You're still gonna kill
innocent people.


The only thing more important

than the weapon
that I have created

is being the only one
who knows how.

Do you understand?

Now, this is the point
in the script

where you reset
his bunk room, please.


Can you bring that up?

Thanks for the advice.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

<i>Thanks for the advice.</i>

HARTING:
Goodbye, old friend.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I love this part.

Look at him.

[DALTON CHUCKLING]

Enjoy it while it lasts.

He's almost done. KT's up next.

How'd you find Baris?

Oh, Axe called his cell
while the big guy was...

doing what he does.
Really?

HARTING:
What story should I try next?

Should I stick
with tennis or...?

Or cricket, maybe.

I'm from Jersey, but if you're
asking, I got script ideas.

I'll pass.
Seriously?

You've already ripped off
every movie clichÃ©.

I think "Psycho Killer"
and a dancing lunatic

in a slaughterhouse is plenty.

No more ideas from you.

Remember what we talked about.

Hey, KT.

What'd you guys talk about?

It's none
of your business, Eric.

Everybody knows.
Know what else everyone knows?

Six inches is not a lot.

Wait, it... That's not...?
That's not...? That's not a lot?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

HARTING:
We call them nanites.

RAY: Those are in my blood?
No. They are your blood.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

Hey, uh, so...

do you think I could get

some kind of RST tech
installed on my body?

Why? Is there a particular part
that needs augmentation?

Hey, Eric.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

No, never mind.

Okay.

Let's go.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

[TIRES SCREECHING]

[HARTING SIGHS]

Ready?

WOMAN: Ops ready.
MAN: Comms ready.

WOMAN 2:
Nanite systems ready.

Where are you going?

Doc, how are you talking to me?

Oh, my God, this guy.

You have millions of wireless
microprocessors in your brain.

We need you to come back now.
<i>I've got unfinished business.</i>

Such a relentless dick.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

It's because he's relentless,
he would literally die for her.

I don't imagine you've ever
cared for anybody that much.


ERIC:
Burn.

Would you please...?
Don't you have somewhere to be?

We are your only business.

We're the only people you know.
<i>That's what you told me.</i>

<i>But I had a wife.
And he took her from me.</i>

What are you talking about?
Who did?

<i>Nick Baris.</i>

Okay. I can see him.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey, boss. Check this out.

We traced the call
to Baris here two days ago.

He hasn't moved since.

And security?

I hacked their camera feeds.

The place is a fortress.
But if he finds a way in,

the 18 men they have
ain't gonna stop him.

Well, he wanted the tech
all to himself.

Now it's coming right for him.

And what's our man found?
Exactly what we want him to.

Let me know when he's on
final approach, okay?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

MAN:
<i>Pulling up satellite feed.</i>

WOMAN:
Acquiring surveillance target.

WOMAN: He's approaching
Baris' compound.

MAN:
See if you can clear that up.

He's at the gate now.

BARIS: American?
Yeah.

Are you sure it's him?

Well, yeah, he...
Never mind. Get Wigans.

Tell him to bring it.
Got it.

MERC [OVER MONITOR]:
<i>Private property.</i>

RAY:
<i>I'm here to see Nick Baris.</i>

MERC 1:
<i>Nature of your business?</i>

RAY:
<i>Oh, I'm here to kill him.</i>

MERC 1: <i>Oh, shit!</i>
MERC 2: <i>What the...?</i>

[GUNFIRE OVER MONITOR]

Whoa!

MAN:
Multiple ballistic impacts.

WOMAN: Abdominal
nanite clusters active.

ERIC: Uh, why is he down?
He only took, like, four rounds.

Look.

Hm. He's Trojan-horsing it.

Pretty clever, actually.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

WIGANS: Why is it always
right when the food arrives?

Baris' office. Now.

Bring the case.

Don't look at my ass.

Don't.

ERIC:
Time for a better view.


MAN:
Energy level's stable, and...

Okay, there's Baris.
Yep.

ERIC: Whoa,
someone's been stress-eating.

We've got him
in the cellar, boss.

What took you so long?

Just chatting about life.

Oh, shit.

What? Who is that, Eric?
He's a techie, just like me.

Here she is.

Okay, it's time.

So he's an IT guy.

We're not IT guys, man.

He's the real deal.
He's a legend.

Yeah.
He's the first guy to figure out

a stable bidirectional
neural interface.

He's so good, I used some
of his open-source code

in this program.
Wait, you used open-source code

in my billion-dollar prototype?

Jesus, Eric.
He's really smart.

If he's so smart,
what's he doing with Baris?

And why didn't we hire him?

[HARTING SIGHS]

ERIC:
We tried.

You're absolutely sure
that's him, yeah?

Because this little beauty
only works once,

and I don't want it...
Uh-oh.

WIGANS:
Oh, shit!

He just put a hole in his chest
with his hand. That is...

Why didn't you leave him
at the gate?

BARIS:
Wigans.

It's him. Do it now.

Now? You want me to do it now?
You should've told me that

five minutes ago.
Yes, now.

MAN:
I'm seeing CNS trauma.

WOMAN 1:
Left lung is collapsing.

WOMAN 2:
Heart rate's at 143.

[MONITOR BEEPING]

[GUNFIRE OVER MONITOR]

Look, mate,
there's a laundry list

of things I have to get done.

What is that thing?
I don't know.

HARTING:
Can you find out, please?

I have to charge it, and...
So charge it.

WOMAN:
Rerouting nanite power.

[GUNSHOT OVER MONITOR]

Look how much this means to him.

It's remarkable, isn't it?
His...

His need to get even,
to get revenge.

[CLATTERING IN DISTANCE]

Do it. Make it work.

Do it now. Do it!
Okay. Okay, okay.

KT: What is that, Eric?
Just give me one second.

That. Put that on my screen.

When it reaches 100 percent...


Oh, that's not good.

That button right there.
Which one? This one?

Not that one. That one.

Get out!
It's one of the two.

Take him away!

Get out!
Put him back in his box.

Bye.

Close the door
and stand outside!

Um, guys?

That thing might be an EMP.
What?

An EMP, an electromagnetic
pulse. It'll...

I know what an EMP is. What
the hell is it doing there?

[GUNFIRE OVER MONITOR]

Shit. He planned this.
Switch me on.

I need you to get out of there.

All right, hurry up.

Come on, come on, come on.

I need you to get out of...

We have a prob... Can he hear me?

He's muting you.
How is he muting me?

Come on, come on.
Wigans, you piece of shit!


HARTING:
If that goes off,

we're screwed.
Eric, fix this, please.

I don't know
how he's doing this.

Something's intercepting
our signal.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


You murdered my wife.


Your wife?
What are you even talking about?

They're lying to you.
You understand?

[GUN COCKS]

I told you I'd find you.

HARTING:
Okay, that solves that.

[GUN CLATTERS ON FLOOR]


Shit. Okay, we've lost picture.
Who the hell pushed that button?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Now we've lost his signal.
ERIC: Come on.

HARTING: Where's the signal?
ERIC: One sec.

Switching to satellite.
Uh, what?

Can you get something
on the screen, please?

I've got nothing
on the screen, Eric.

There's no signal.

ERIC: Not a light on for miles.
Eric,

I have nothing!

GINA:
<i>Husband.</i>

Ray.
WIGANS: <i>Hello?</i>

Hello? You still with me?
Wake up.

[WIGANS LAUGHS]

Ray. No!

Okay, perhaps
a bit more voltage, then.

[MACHINE WHIRRING]

Now, believe me,
this is going to hurt you

a lot more than it's gonna...
Ah, whatever.

No, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm a friendly.

I'm on your side. Yeah.

Yeah. Look.

Look at me letting you go.

Look at that. Freedom.

[WIGANS PANTING]

[BATTERY BUZZES]
[SWITCHES CLICKING]

And Wigans said,
"Let there be light,"

and there was light.
Look at that.

Whoo! Still warm.

Who the hell are you?

Mm! Goodness gracious,
how rude of me.

The name's Wilfred Wigans.

I know.
Bit of a superhero-type name.

Heh, heh. And I suppose
my superpower could be...

[IMITATES TYPING]

...coding.

You work for Baris?

Oh, yeah, no.

Listen, define "work for."

It's more like
indentured servitude, heh.

I've been looking
for a way out of here.

I really have.
And I tried up there.

There's a guy
with a gun up there.

I'm sure you killed him,
right?

You're like a knight
in shining armor. Yeah.

Except for you don't really wear
any armor, now, do you?

You sort of, like, let yourself
get shot, like, a lot.

Because that's tough to watch,
actually. It's rough stuff.

Particularly the part
where they walked up to you

and, boom, clipped you
right in your head,

and then your brains
just, pfft...

all over the floor.
Wicked, man. Wicked.

I feel like I died.

My apologies.
I am terribly sorry about that.

You know, Baris wanted me
to take you out,

but I had plans of my own.

I waited until you did your...

business, which you
most certainly did.

Now I'm done
with that bloody piece of shit

telling me what to do
and how to do it.

WIGANS:
<i>You all right?</i>

Thanks for the advice.

Are you all right?

I saw my wife in a dream.

Well, good.

I saw her murdered
right in front of me.

Each time, the murderer was...

a different person.

Holy shit.

So that's how they did it.

Did what?

Okay, okay, um...

I heard them talking.

There have been these rumors
of a hired killer wiping out

every defector of RST.

Baris worked for RST?

Well, they all did.

And no one could figure out why
each kill was like a vendetta.

You know, like it was
really, really personal.

They filled my head
with nightmares

and sent me
on a suicide mission.

Yeah, it certainly seems
that way.

I mean, they've been
clearly manipulating you.

It's likely
that what you think is real...

sometimes ain't.

Harting just used me.

Just lied to my face
over and over again.

Yeah. He seems to be
remarkably convincing.

Told me my wife...

Gina.

I never even looked for her.

But what if...?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look,

they're not gonna
just let you walk away.

They'll come for you.
They'll come for me too.

I'm looking forward to it.
I'm not.

Why do you think I went
biblical and brought you back?

Think I'm running around,

resurrecting people
from the dead?

If they plug you back in,

it's going to be me in your head

killing that lovely wife
of yours.

And I've seen what you've done
to those people.

Just gonna walk away
from me, innit?

My God, what are you...?
What are you doing?

[NANITES TRILLING]

You could figure out
how these work.

So just reverse engineer

the work
of dozens of scientists,

billions of dollars
and a decade of genetic coding?

Well, that's your superpower.

I mean, yeah,
I'll be done by dinner,

so it's not a big deal.

That is absolutely amazing.

You know,
I've heard the stories,

but your entire system
is completely programmable.

A program
they no longer control.

It's my army now.

And your job
to keep it that way.

Okay. I believe the words
you were searching for were:

[IMITATING RAY]
"Thank you, Wigans.

Thank you for resurrecting me
from the dead."

[NORMAL VOICE] Wait.
I've got something for you.

It should be right here
in my trusty lead-lined fridge.

Oh, I am so clever.
I don't want that.

Right. Oh, here it is. Bingo.

No! No! Not that one.
That won't work.

Trust me. Here, follow me.
And take this.

I don't need it. The nanites
will connect me to the Web.

No, the nanites will connect you
to an RST server.

They can track you that way,
fill your head with bullshit.

You don't want that.
Here, take it.

It'll connect you
directly to a satellite.

Vintage. No electronic parts.

Thank you, Wigans.

What is this place?

This is a neural space,

Let me make this easier.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This is all for you.

You used me.

You made me kill.

I didn't make you kill, Ray.

You've always done that.

I just cleared the path.
I freed you to be your best.

My best?!
Yes.

By making me watch them
kill my wife

over and over and over again?

Revenge is what makes
a man like you exceptional, Ray.

You know nothing
about men like me!

You sure about that?

You chose war because
you love it. That's who you are.

You don't know what I love.

Or why I did what I did.

People like you break people
like me into pieces.

And you put us
into these little boxes

so you can understand us
and you can control us.

But you can't control us.

People like boxes, Ray.

They need structure.
They need guidance.

That's just a reality.

Says the man who puts
the shadows on the wall.

There's nothing left
for you out there.

Nothing. In here, you get to be
the best version of yourself.

You rescue the hostage.

You get to spend the night
with a woman who loves you.

And you wake up in the morning

with a new body
and a defined purpose.

What more could you ask for?

Your best version of me!

Not mine!

Don't you get it?

Life is about
not knowing what's coming.

What, like when
it's taken away from you?

Not knowing when it's gonna be
taken away from you,

is that what you mean, Ray?

You did this to me.

You made me.

But you can't
control me forever.

I will find you,
and I will end...

No, you won't.

some adjustments

to increase your stamina.

You know, your stamina?
