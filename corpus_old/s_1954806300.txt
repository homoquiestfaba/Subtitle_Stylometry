<i>Â¶ that blue dress on Â¶</i>

Radio announcer: <i>Good morning. It's
time for the peninsula report.</i>

<i>After three weeks, the murder</i>
<i>of a local burlingame girl</i>

<i>remains unsolved,</i>
<i>and police have no leads</i>

<i>in the killing</i>
<i>of Kathleen donlevy,</i>

<i>the eighth grader</i>
<i>last seen alive</i>

<i>at a parking lot carnival.</i>

<i>Coroners say the victim</i>
<i>was tortured...</i>

Forced to drink bleach,
window cleaner.

<i>The investigation</i>
<i>at a standstill...</i>

woman:<i> Mary!</i>

<i>Mary, breakfast is ready!</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

Mary, can you see my butt?

I can smell it.
Shut up.

Can I speak with you?

Boy:<i> Busted.</i>

What are these?
I don't know.

Don't tell me you don't know.

You know what these are.

What are they doing
in this house?

I don't know.
Where'd you find them?

It doesn't matter
where I found them,

<i>does it? The point</i>
<i>is I found them.</i>

<i>Are they yours?</i>

They're not...
Tell me. Are they yours?

No, they're not mine.
Mom, mom, mom.

They're mine. I mean...
I mean, they're Liz's.

I was holding them so she
wouldn't get in trouble.

It's okay.

We are gonna talk
about this later...

shut up, little miss perfect.

Girl: <i>What's up?</i>

The question is why?
Why did he kill her?

Didn't you hear me honking
for you last night?

I met some guys at the park.

You know, maybe she represented

some kind of threatening female
figure, you know, like mom...

one of them asked me to the
exchange dance next Friday.

I bet it was one of those sick guys who
totally got molested by his father.

Mary.
It's so classic.

It always happens.
Would you shut up?

Stop talking about Kathleen

like she's some kind
of statistic.

I wasn't.
<i> Yes, you were.</i>

<i>This isn't in a magazine.</i>

It's real.
Margie's little sister is dead.

The guy could still be around.
It's creepy.

Let me set you up
next Friday for the dance.

Do you think I'm,
like, the butt-ugliest?

No, of course not.

Then why have I
never had a date?

Because every time
you meet a guy,

you start talking about the five
different kinds of head wounds.

The virgin Mary

is not only pure,
but immaculate.

<i>Not only virtuous,</i>

but innocence itself.

<i>She is sacred,</i>

<i>completely untainted by sin.</i>

Mary giordano.

Yes, sister?

Please recite
the hierarchy of values.

Um...

It's so nice
to have you back, Margie.

Your sister has been
in our prayers.

Thank you.

We were about to hear
the hierarchy of values.

Supernatural, spiritual,
intellectual, material.

Tell us in your own words

the hierarchy's significance.

Well, it's kind of
like a structure,

<i>a way of looking at things.</i>

It's kind of like God
gave us this plan,

and if we have faith in it

and follow its rules,
he'll protect us.

<i>In God's world,</i>

there's a reason
for everything.

Nun: <i>Yes, Margie?</i>

<i>Margie?</i>

Hey.

Hey, new cadets?
Well, I hope so.

We're about to give them guns.

You want one?

Nah. I got to get
in shape for my exam.

Ah.
Is g-man here?

Yeah, he's in his cell.
Great.

But, Mary, I wouldn't go back
there if I were you! Mary!

Man:<i> Yeah?</i>

Shit.

Don't you have piano lessons
or something?

Tell me what you have
on the donlevy case.

Didn't I help you write the
paper on Jeffrey dahmer?

Yeah.
Didn't I help you

build a model of San Quentin

for your California
history class?

Yeah.

Then get the hell out.

Dad would have
wanted you to help me.

Your dad was killed
in the line of duty.

He'd want you to have
a nice, safe desk job.

You know I'd be a good cop.

You want to know
what police work is?

Most of the time you sit on
your ass writing reports.

The rest of the time, you spend
with the scum of the earth.

People are basically good.
They just...

they're good and bad.

You better keep your eyes open,

or you're going
to get in trouble.

Believe me. I know my business.

Really?

Is that why Kathleen's
killer is behind bars?

Now you listen to me,
you little shit.

This freak
made her drink bleach,

window cleaner, and chopped her up.
He's still out there.

So the last thing I need is for
some snot-nosed junior miss

coming in here
giving me advice!

But didn't you say
that a detective's job

is to step into the victim's
shoes and walk backwards?

That's right.

So unless you've stepped in miss
donlevy's shoes yourself...

So I'm like, "how do you know?"

Go! Go!

<i>Are you serious?</i>

He took off my top,
then my underwear.

<i>No way.</i>

Then he took off his pants.

<i>What did you do?</i>

Woman:<i> 13 more.</i>

So who's your boyfriends?

Don't you guys have boyfriends?

<i>She sort of does.</i>

You have a boyfriend?

Yeah.
A little young.

Girl: <i>That's what I told her.</i>

Man:<i> You girls really
shouldn't talk to strangers.</i>

He's so cute.

Do you know that guy?

Sure. He's been hanging
around here a lot.

Child:<i> Hey!</i>

Barker:
<i>50 cents to crack the whip!</i>

<i>Only three balls, a chance</i>
<i>to win the big prize.</i>

<i>Have a nice weekend.</i>

<i>Remember, graduation rehearsal</i>

<i>will be at 2:00 P.M.</i>
<i>next Friday.</i>

God, what is wrong with you?

Radio host:
<i>Let me ask you this, Jay.</i>

<i>Do you ever feel</i>
<i>any remorse after you kill?</i>

Jay:<i> Remorse?</i>
<i>Why should I feel remorse?</i>

<i>Okay. Why don't</i>
<i>we go to the phones?</i>

<i>Line three, you're on the air.</i>

I need you to go
to the mini mart for me.

Well, can't John go?

He's at Jason's,
and Vicky's at the mall.

I just need a few things.

It will only take you a minute.

Mary: Damn it.

Man: <i>Sir, I'm sorry. We are out.</i>

Sorry.
Excuse me.

Oh, my eyes!

Man: <i>What the hell is
going on out here?</i>

I can't see!

How was I supposed
to know he was a cop?

Tony Campbell, a new cadet.

Highest test scores
in his class.

I'm blind.

Why were you following me?

I saw you here at the station.

I thought you were one of
donlevy's girlfriends.

<i>I thought you might</i>
<i>lead me to something.</i>

I ought to kick
both of you in the ass.

You know it's against
regulations for a cadet

<i>to be investigating anything.</i>

That's why you
don't have access

to files or any kind
of information.

And, you, I'm citing you

for using unregistered mace.

And the next time that you want

to dream up some espionage,

I'm calling your mother.

You messed him up,
you take him home.

What do you care
about Kathleen, anyway?

No way I'm waiting 10
years to make detective.

You know, this case
is very similar

to one that happened
two years ago in...

Utah? I know.

Tammy ryder.

Teenage girl disappears
into thin air,

body parts scattered
all over the place.

Police found nothing.

Searched the car,
clothes, house.

Not even a flake of skin

to track the guy through DNA.

How do you know all that?

Are you really trying
to find Kathleen's killer?

<i>I mean, 'cause if you are,</i>

<i>as a cadet, you do have access</i>

to all the computers.

I mean, we could track down

any suspect we got
through Washington.

With more than one person,

we could cover
twice as much ground,

interview twice...
<i> Whoa, whoa.</i>

Wait a minute.

Why are you after this guy?

She could have been me.

I'm not into babysitting.

No! No, that's a foul!

That is a stupid foul!
You idiot!

You are so stupid!

Is guinn in?

They tell me to bet
against the clippers

'cause they can't win a game,

and now I've lost
50 bucks. Gosh.

Is guinn in?

You know it's his day off.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's great.

But I left something in
his office the other day,

and I want to go get it.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

<i>Come on!</i>

Kathleen.

<i>...0800, please report</i>

<i>to the kit room</i>
<i>at the end of the shift.</i>

<i> Repeat, three...</i>
Officer:<i> He said that?</i>

No way.

<i> Amazing.</i>
<i> Yeah, I know.</i>

Hey, Sherlock.

<i>Come on, man. Hey, Tony.</i>

<i>Hurry up!</i>

Okay, I'm sorry about
the babysitting comment.

If it's good enough,
we could work together.

Please?

Come on.

Looks like an employee list

of the carnival. Big deal.

She was seen somewhere later.

What?

At the mini mart.

Let me handle this.
Why?

Because you got to break
into the records room.

Now it's my turn.

We're with
the police department.

Like to ask you
a few questions.

I already told
you guys everything.

Well, we'd like
to hear it again.

Were you working the night
the donlevy girl came in?

Yeah.
Can you describe the events of that night

and your contact
with miss donlevy?

You guys ain't cops.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Ow! Shit! Okay!

<i>She came in about 12:30</i>

<i>and picked up some</i>
<i>cleanser or something.</i>

She stood around
like she expected me

to say something,
and then she left.

Was anyone with her?

Clerk:<i> No!</i>

Ow!

<i>Ow! Ow. Don't...</i>

wait. There was a blue car
in the parking lot.

<i>I looked up later,</i>
<i>and it was gone.</i>

Thanks for your cooperation.

I can't believe
you just did that.

He wasn't going
to tell us anything.

You didn't have to hurt him.

It jogged his memory,
didn't it?

It was illegal.

Hey, what do you think
being a cop is, Mary?

You walk in, offer you a
donut, and spill their guts?

This is the real world.
People get hurt,

bleed, die.

He could go to the police.

He won't. He's got four b&es

and a fear of going
back to county.

Look, if we're going to work
together, you got to trust me.

Why should I?

Because you lived your whole
life in a suburban bubble.

I've seen the world for the
shithole it really is.

You think I'm naive.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to scare you.

You really think
the world's that bad?

My dad gave me a bad attitude.

When I was growing up,
he wanted me to be a diver.

Only one thing he never
took into consideration,

I'm afraid of heights.

I remember one time

they made me
go off the high dive.

Everyone was screaming
for me to go,

and I just
stood there petrified.

Tough cop, huh?

I got to go. I got to study.

Radio: <i>Only two short
blocks from central Avenue.</i>

<i>This fun-filled extravaganza</i>

<i>of rides and games</i>
<i>will send you</i>

<i>and your family into a spin.</i>

<i>Carnival magic</i>
<i>is in your neighborhood.</i>

<i>It's the final week</i>
<i>of a month of fun,</i>

<i>so be sure</i>
<i>and catch carnival magic.</i>

<i>It's brought thrills</i>
<i>to boys and girls</i>

<i>up and down the west coast.</i>

"Up and down the west coast."

Hmm.

Man:<i> Hey, you want the
tilt-a wheel tonight?</i>

Hi.
Man:<i> On it!</i>

Do you know where
the main office is?

<i>Right over there.</i>

Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

Hi.

I'm writing an article
for my high school paper

on modern-day
traveling carnivals,

and I was wondering...

Could you tell me what cities
you've been to in the past year?

Yes.

John:<i> No.</i>

I'll do your dishes
for a month.

Yeah, last time, I think I got

about 50 hours
community service.

Uh-uh.

John!

All right. 100 bucks.

I can't get 100 bucks.

It's easy. You just take
it from mom's stash,

replace it with money
from your savings.

I'm not going
to steal from mom.

Okay.

Yeah?

Okay.

You know, if mom snakes you
doing this, you're dead meat.

Yeah, yeah, I know. Go. Do it.

These carnival employees,

I need to know what kinds
of cars they drive.

No blue cars.

Cars seen near
unsolved murder sites.

Okay.

<i>Colt, tercel,</i>

<i>corolla, Malibu, karman ghia.</i>

No. No. No.

No. No.

Colt. Corolla.

<i>Tercel. Karmann ghia.</i>

<i>My God.</i>

Earl parkins.

Hello.

We have a suspect.

Hi. I'm almost ready.

Come on in.

That's okay.
I'll just wait out here.

Whatever.

Man: <i>The ring toss.</i>

<i>Come win,</i>
<i>and play the ring toss.</i>

Let's go, dad.
<i> Yeah.</i>

Jesus. His hand is messed up.

Mary: <i>Looks like it's deformed.</i>

The only wild card
is that blue Malibu

suspected in Washington.
Tony:<i> Hmm.</i>

<i> Wonder why the cops didn't catch the pattern?</i>
<i> They weren't looking for it.</i>

As far as they're concerned,
these are separate murders.

The m.O.S are different.

<i>They happened</i>
<i>in different cities.</i>

Barker: <i>We've got a winner</i>

<i>on horse number three.</i>
<i>Horse number three.</i>

What about the carnival, though?
It's an obvious link.

Maybe not all the victims
went to the carnival.

I mean, why would
the cops know about it

if there was nothing
to lead them there?

<i>The only reason I thought of it</i>

<i>was 'cause I heard</i>
<i>the radio commercial</i>

and remembered some
of the west coast murders

in "true crimes'"
unsolved file.

The victims were
all teenage girls.

If he did it, I wonder why.

Maybe 'cause he's
a freaking maniac.

Murder is
a desperate cry for help,

someone reaching out.

If you can figure out why
someone does something,

you can help them.

Really?
Yeah.

Bang.

A woman's walking
down a street.

A bullet hits her head.

Bang. A plane crashes
into a Mountain,

300 people dead.

Bang. Baby gets leukemia,

<i>dies at age three.</i>

What's your point?

The world is chaotic.

Sometimes there are no reasons.

You're wrong.

You seriously think
he wants to get caught?

Come on.

Tony: <i>No way am I going
up on that thing.</i>

<i>Oh, yeah. Afraid of heights.</i>

Well, keep an eye on me.

I got to check
something out, okay?

Hey. Hey.

Mary.

Going solo, huh?

Have a nice ride.

Mary: <i>Where's he going?</i>

Only one way to find out.

Oh, my God.
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

Mary: <i>He's going to kill her.</i>

Tony: <i>If anything
happens, I'll break in.</i>

Woman: Wait a second.
Tell you what.

<i> Tell you what...</i>
<i> What?</i>

I don't feel like anything.

Mary: <i>Follow him. Follow him.</i>

Get her plate number first.

Two...

You have fun today, Roxanne?

I did.

Mary: Maybe he's
playing some kind

of waiting game, you know?

Piece of crap.

What's your poison?
Huh?

Drink. I'm having a beer.

You want a beer?
Yeah, sure.

Make yourself comfortable.

Have a seat.

Thanks.

Cheers.

Cheers.

Big drinker, huh?

Blue Malibu.

The blue Malibu.

Where the hell
is the blue Malibu?

Well, let's take
into consideration

the kid at the mini mart
could be full of shit.

True.

All right, so here's
the plan for tomorrow.

After class,
I'll keep an eye on Earl.

You track down that girl.

Okay.

What's that?

Um...

They're just family photos.

Family photos?
Yeah.

I've never seen
anyone so nervous

<i> about family photos.</i>
They're just...

Just what?

Oh...

when'd you take these?

When I followed you.

Come here.

There's fingerprints on 'em.

Did you look at them?

We can't do this.
We can't do this.

Mary.

Mary!

You're just a kid.

I know I'm not pretty.

You're beautiful.

You're beautiful.

I don't want to scare you.

I'm not afraid.

Mrs. Giordano: <i>She was
out till 3:00 A.M.,</i>

<i>wouldn't tell me anything.</i>

Guinn: <i>I'll take care of it.</i>

Where the hell
were you last night?

What?

Get your damn clothes on.

Man: <i>Yeah, go ahead
and send him in.</i>

Settle that stuff
when we have...

you want to see what
happens to little girls

when they stay out all night?

Ow.

Officer: <i>Get a shot of the body.</i>

<i>Hands are cut off.</i>

This guy is not gonna stop.

<i>Do you understand?</i>

What are you doing?

I've never seen mom
so upset before.

Mrs. Giordano: <i>Vicky!
Vicky, are you dressed?</i>

Vicky:<i> Mary.</i>

<i>Sherry tarnley.</i>

Sherry: <i>No, just listen to me.</i>

<i> I didn't lie. I...</i>
<i> You're lying.</i>

You're lying to me.

No, I...

you're just like every damn
one of them, aren't you?

Aren't you?

Ahh.

Unh!

All right,
you take care of the...

Officer: <i>Get down, Moore.</i>

<i>Moore, get the hell down.</i>

Just settle down, buddy.
Settle down.

What's going on?

You know the girl
they found this morning?

Turns out she's been dead
for at least a month.

She was covered in the same
kind of trace dirt

that they found
on the donlevy body.

So the neighbors,
they I.D. This guy

they see hanging around...
Melvin Moore.

Turns out he's got six prior
sex offenses with minors,

was at the carnival,

and had in his possession
a bloody hunting knife

that appears to have
cut through flesh.

It's all over.

<i>That's all, Kathleen.</i>

<i>You can do it.</i>

<i> You got it. Come on.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

<i>Whoo!</i>

<i>You did it. Hooray!</i>

<i>Good girl.</i>

Margie: <i>It's weird.</i>

Sometimes when
I come in here...

I think she's still alive.

Mrs. Donlevy: <i>Margie!</i>

My mom's not doing too well.

I'll be right back.

Earl.

What night of the week
did Kathleen disappear?

A Friday.

Why?

March 25th. Friday.

April 29th, it's a Friday.

They're all Fridays.

They're all last Fridays
of the month.

Oh, my God.

One day away.

Paper.

Paper. Paper.

I tried to call, but...

Jesus Christ. You scared
the shit out of me.

<i> How'd you get in?</i>
I picked the lock.

You picked the lock?

Um...

Guinn has a suspect.

<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

Turns out the guy was locked up

for three months around the
time the girl was killed.

<i>They released him an hour ago.</i>

What about the knife?

Animal blood.

But while everyone was going
ape-shit over this guy,

I logged into n.C.I.C.
Guess what.

Our friend Earl parkins
is a felon,

did hard time at the point
of the Mountain.

What's wrong?

Nothing. I'm just tired.

Hey, you okay about last night?

Yeah. I got to go home.

I'm grounded.

Glass cleaner.
Everybody has bleach.

It's no big deal.

Mary: <i>And then I found the car.</i>

I can't believe
you've been doing

exactly what I
told you not to do.

All right.

I'll check the plates
of the Malibu

to see if they're
registered to Campbell.

But I want you to stop

this Nancy drew bullshit
right now!

You think I'm imagining
all this, don't you?

A cop has to be able
to distinguish

between fact and fantasy.

What if I eliminate
my other suspect

and prove my instincts
are right?

I want you home. Now.

Radio:
<i>And Jesus said unto them,</i>

<i>"suffer the little children</i>
<i>up to me."</i>

Excuse me. Is Sherry home?
She's at work.

<i>Put your hands on the radio,</i>
<i>and feel the power of...</i>

have you traveled with
him at all this year?

<i>Driver number 17,</i>

<i>report to loading</i>
<i>dock 12 for pickup.</i>

<i>Driver 17, report to 12.</i>

Earl loves me.

If you remember anything
about those Friday nights,

will you please call me?

Roxanne: <i>Go away.</i>

It's Mary giordano.
I need to talk to you.

<i>Is he screwing you too?</i>

He's a suspect
in a murder case.

I'm trying to establish
his whereabouts.

You know the problem
with little rich girls?

They stick
their lily-white noses in

where they don't belong.

Look, in order to clear him,

I need an eyewitness alibi

for at least one of the
Friday nights I gave you.

<i>You want to tell me</i>
<i>where he was, great.</i>

If you don't, I'm going to get

the cops down here
now and ask you

where you were
the night of the murder.

Get out.

Please.

He's in trouble.

I'm trying to help him.

He has Friday nights off.

He went out of town
the last Friday in march.

Where did he go?

His mother tried
to kill herself

in some kind of
institution in Phoenix.

<i>Earl went down there</i>
<i>to see her.</i>

Do you know the name
of the place?

Sunnybrook.

Like the farm.

Woman:<i>Good evening. Sunnybrook.</i>

Hi. I'm the daughter of a
patient there, a Mrs. Parkins.

My brother's missing,
and I'm trying to locate him.

Can you tell me whether he
visited her on march 29th?

<i>I'm sorry. We do not</i>
<i>keep detailed records.</i>

<i>All I can tell you is whether or
not she had any visitors that day.</i>

Well, could you please do that?

<i>Let's see.</i>

<i>Mrs. May parkins.</i>

<i>All right, had one male
visitor on the 29th.</i>

<i>He arrived at 7:00 P.M.</i>
<i>and left at 9:00.</i>

<i>He came back</i>
<i>the next day at noon.</i>

Are you sure?

<i>Absolutely.</i>
<i>I recorded it myself.</i>

Vicky: <i>What are you doing?</i>

Baiting a trap.

Recording:
<i>Hi there. This is Tony.</i>

<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

<i>Leave a message at the beep,</i>

<i>and I'll call you back.</i>

Mary: <i>Hi. It's me.</i>

<i>Meet me at</i>
<i>the mini mart at 9:00.</i>

<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

Hi.

Look, we got to make this fast.

I got to get back
to Earl the pearl.

Earl didn't do it.

What do you mean?

I thought you said
you didn't have a car.

I don't.

Then why is there a blue
Malibu parked in your garage?

What?

There's a blue Malibu
parked in your garage.

It must be my landlord's.

Does that have anything
to do with the bleach...

you killed her.

Shit. For a second,
I thought...

Excuse me.

I have to go murder someone.

Tony:<i> Mary.</i>

Unh!

<i>Mary, Mary.</i>

<i>Row number three...</i>

Mary, you okay?
<i> Will stand up.</i>

It's just a dream.

Just breathe slow.

Teacher: Are you all right?

Take her out of the sun.
Get her some water.

What the hell is going on?

You don't return my calls.

Please stay with me tonight.

It's the exchange dance.

Please.

Come with me.

That info on the
Malibu plates came in.

Is there a girl with...

Blonde hair that lives here?

She's not here right now.

I need to talk to her.

Um...

Something's happening, and I...

I want you
to watch your sister.

What's going on?

I don't know.
I mean, some weird girl

stops by the house
today, right,

totally freaks out my mom.

Liz: <i>Who was it?</i>

She had, like, this gigantic
bruise over her arm.

It looked like somebody
kicked the shit out of her.

What?

Some weird girl
stopped by the house today.

It looked like she was
on something, you know?

What did she say?

Nothing. She just said

she wanted to talk to you.

I'll be right back.
I got to go see her.

You see?

She's acting
like a total psycho.

Why didn't you
answer your phone?

Mary:<i> Damn it.</i>

Tony: <i>No way am I going
up on that thing.</i>

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

No!

<i>No!</i>

Stop it!

Are you okay?

Mary.

I'm sorry I hit you.

I thought you were going
to take us both down.

I'm not going
to hurt you, Mary.

<i>I was scared to death up there.</i>

Why was today circled
on your calendar?

I had my final exams
this morning.

I passed. I'm a cop.

<i>Overheard Earl</i>
<i>and that woman Roxanne</i>

<i>talking about you.</i>

I got worried.

I borrowed my landlord's car

to make sure you were okay.

Here.

You dropped these.

Come with me.

I don't want to leave you here.

Where are you going?

Sherry tarnley's
been reported missing.

Hey, hey, what's going on?

We found the decomposed
girl's jacket.

Forensics looked at a print
off one of the buttons,

and they matched to a guy
who works at the carnival.

Who?

An ex-con named Earl parkins.

<i>Sherry.</i>

Oh, my God.

Shh, shh, shh.

Quiet. Quiet.

Officer: <i>Hey, want
me to bag the noose?</i>

<i>Nah. It's a slam-dunk suicide.</i>

It's all my fault.

Why didn't you tell me
about parkins?

Officer: <i>Keep the tape up.</i>

<i>Get the lab here.</i>

I want you in my office

at 8:00 A.M.

Yes, sir.

Looks like the guy
left us a note.

Officer: <i>We got to run
this stuff back down.</i>

Woman: <i>These young women</i>

<i>will now step into the world...</i>

And take with them an education

that will serve them well.

Girls, you've only
just begun your journey.

May your lives
be filled with love,

<i>charity, hope, and happiness.</i>

Mother: We're so proud of you.

Woman: <i>Well, we wouldn't
miss this for the world.</i>

Man: <i>Not for the world.</i>

Excuse me.

Girls: <i>Party! Party!</i>

<i>Party! Party! Party!</i>

Hi.

Hi.

Congratulations.

Sherry came to me.

<i>Chevy Malibu registered</i>
<i>to Daniel Henry moffat.</i>

Sir, we're going to order
out for some Chinese.

Do you want some?

<i>Jesus.</i>

<i>How many people did you</i>
<i>interrogate today?</i>

Parkins was in the joint
for forgery.

He never hurt a flea.

Now all of a sudden, he
confesses to six murders?

Yeah, well,
the note contains details

only the killer could know.

The guy wasn't a whacko.

All his jail
psych tests were normal.

He's a guy with
no reason to kill.

Get this dusted for me.

<i>I'm sorry to bother you,</i>
<i>Mr. Tarnley,</i>

but I need to ask you
one more question.

To your knowledge, did parkins
have any female friends

<i>other than your daughter?</i>

Did Sherry ever mention anyone?

She mentioned an ex-wife
a couple of times,

said she was real jealous.
"Jealous," I said.

"Now, that's what you get for
fornicating against the lord."

<i> You throw down his commandment...</i>
Please.

This ex-wife, do you remember
the woman's name?

Roxanne.

Roxanne something.

This is one-Stanley-seven.

I need to get an a.P.B.
On the teletype right away.

Roxanne dicarlo...

Caucasian, 35,

may be dangerous.

Earl: <i>Have a nice ride.</i>

Sherry: <i>Earl loves me.</i>

Officer: <i>Looks like the
guy left us a note.</i>

<i>Suicide.</i>

The noose.

There's no way
he could do this with one hand.

Tony: <i>You like my photos?</i>

Hmm?

I was working that night.

A person can get upset.

Hey, we got that print info
back on the styrofoam cup.

What is it?

Jesus Christ.

Aren't you going
to ask any questions?

Cops are supposed
to ask questions.

Earl and I go way back.

I did him a favor once.

When he got out,
he let me borrow his cars.

Nice guy.

Till he fell in love
with Sherry.

Then he got the idea

the world was
a beautiful place.

I had to teach him a lesson.

It was so easy
to set it all up.

You know,
I followed you that day,

from the station to the pool,

don't you, Mary?

I watched you at night,

looked through your window,

saw you touching my picture.

The moment I saw you,

marching around
in that little uniform...

So sure of the world...

just knew I had to be
your teacher too.

You planted the rabbit's
foot at Kathleen's...

The prints that
implicated parkins...

The suicide note.

It's time to open
your graduation present.

Did she say
where she was going?

Vicky: No.
Did she say anything?

After the graduation,

she kept asking me
why this girl Sherry

would go to a recycling
place alone

with someone who
she knew was dangerous.

Kathleen?

<i>She was the easiest one of all.</i>

Hi.

<i>I told her I was</i>
<i>a police officer.</i>

<i>I needed her to check out</i>

<i>some illegal activity</i>
<i>over at the mini mart.</i>

Good. It's a good job,
very serious job.

<i>Apparently the clerk there</i>

<i>had been selling drugs</i>
<i>to junior high school kids</i>

<i>who brought cleaning
supplies to the counter.</i>

<i>Could she go in, purchase some,</i>

<i>see if he approached her?</i>

<i>She was such</i>
<i>a good little citizen.</i>

No. He didn't try
to sell me anything.

Don't get up.

You don't want to get up.

Bang.

Guinn: <i>Hold it right
there, Campbell.</i>

Put your hands up slowly.

Well, if isn't papa cop...

Come to save little baby cop.

Guinn: <i>Shut up.</i>

You know, after we had
our little talk,

I got to wondering
who the hell you were,

so I lifted your prints

off the coffee cup
you left in my office.

Then I got a match
from the f.B.I.

Daniel Henry moffat.

Roomed with Earl parkins

in the Utah state penitentiary.

<i>Whose prints did you use</i>

<i>for your cadet exam, moffat?</i>

The girl we found
up on skyline?

<i>Get on the floor.</i>

<i>Get on the floor!</i>

Put your hands
behind your back.

Ohh!

No!

Guinn:<i> Ohh!</i>

Ohh!

Aah! Aah!

Why?

Why?

Why?

No reason, Mary.

That's the real world.

Ohh!

Oh, my God.

Mary.

<i>Mary.</i>

<i>Can you reach?</i>

No.

<i>No.</i>
