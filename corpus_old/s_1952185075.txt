Ah, the last day of the school year

Today is the day we seniors celebrate
graduation and move on with our lives

It's also the day the entire campus takes part
in the annual 24 hour party starting at 6 AM

I love it here at college

That's me and my twin brother Evan

Evan and I are part of a fraternity and
not just any fraternity - Iota Gamma Chi

By far the wildest fraternity on campus

We're celebrating the last day
in true academic form

Starting off with a traditional
6 AM pajama party

Then a pig roast in the afternoon

If we aren't passed out yet
we'll go take a couple final exams

Tonight we'll activate the pledges
and throw one last kick ass party

Sounds great huh

My brother and I
are so fucking depressed

We've been dreading this day for 4 years

We don't want to graduate

This is officially the worst day
of our entire lives

Where the fuck is Jake and Evan

I think they're sleeping

Sleeping? It's 6 AM, time to party

Yeah! Let's go get 'em

Wake up bitches

Get drunk, let's get drunk

Wake up bitches

Whoo, yeah, party

Hey, you guys this is the
final day of the college year

Also known as the
last day of college partying

Make the most of it; honestly this time next year
you're going to wish you were back in college

Party, yeah
The girls are here

No kidding, where the hell have you been

I just woke up

Scooter, you might
make it to first base today

That's very funny Keggar, you know,
just kick me while I'm down.

Today is your day Scooter

I need to get laid;
I have never gotten laid

I know

Come get some; let's get drunk

Hey honestly, this is your last day of
college partying for the rest of your lives.

Make the most of it

Hello, hey dad.

What

No, some of the guys downstairs
are just playing some music

Drinking

No, it's only 6 AM dad

Yeah, you know I just don't know if Evan
and I want to go into the banking business

Yes Sir

No, sir

O.K., we'll see you and
Mom early tomorrow then

Alright, sir

Jake, Evan, want some beerios

I'll take some beerios
Alright

No, no, no beerios; come dance with us

Hey Brandon, you
got some beers for us man

Nope, but I got some
shots for ya' you fucking pussies

Yeah, O.K., they're coming
to dance with us anyway

I'm not dancing

No, no we don't wanna dance

No dancing

Hey girls, you want to

Oh my God, O.K., O.K., O.K.

Ready, 1, 2, 3

Maybe we could dance a little bit

Dancing is my favorite pastime

I love dancing

Hey, this is awkward,
but I'm just going to say it

My friend told me that you think I'm cute and
I think you are, like, the hottest guy on campus

I've had a crush on you, like, all year

Really, Oh my God, I, I've been trying to ask
you out all year, but I couldn't figure out how

You're really hot

Um, I'm not talking to you;
I'm on the phone

Oh my God, this really
creepy guy just tried...

Man, this is bull

This is bullshit, 6 freaking AM and I'm
running around like a jerk serving drinks

You know what, I'm out of here

Hold on, hold on, this is the last day

You're not quitting now

Alright man, Alright

I don't know why I'm doing this though
I mean do you

I don't know Respect, Brotherhood

My dad was a Gamma Chi, so if Iwant him to
pay for my schooling I have to become one

You really believe all that shit

You really believe all that shit John

About brotherhood and all that

Yes I do

These guys are great guys

We just need to get
through pledging, you'll see

That's not why I'm here

So why the hell are you here

What, are you serious

Pussy man, pussy

Shoot, this frat gets laid
more than any other frat on campus

And you know what I'm talking about

Yeah that's right

Hey, Hey, check out
my boy Adam over there

And you know what I'm talking about

Ah, here you go Jeff

Thank you sir

Yeah
You good

Do you want to go up to my room

I don't know, what for

So I can show you my baseball bat

Ah, is it a Louisville Slugger

Nope, it's a Hong Kong Slugger

It's a much bigger city

Well, do you have any condoms

Oh yeah

Alright, let's go

Um, hi

I live here

So,

Ah, you want to see my room

What for

Well, I, I, I, want
to show you my bowling ball

Oh, how many balls do you have

Just the one

What's up Stephanie

Oh, just talking to the Uni-baller here

Let's go
Anytime you're ready old man

Keggar my friend

You do not deserve to be called Keggar

Compared to me you're just little old Jason
who can't drink with the big boys

This isn't 1999 anymore

I'm the fastest in the frat now

Fossil, I need your help

Ah, I'm a little busy right now
When then

Ah, O.K., real quick
what can I help you with

Can we please do this

Pa Pa Patience boy

Continue
I don't want to say

Well then you don't get any help

Today

Look, I can't get laid

Just forget it

No, no, you know who has
2 thumbs that can help you get laid

This guy

So, hey, swing by my room a
little bit later and I'll help you out

Alright when

Whenever, later

Sure, ah I'm picking up
a 90 pound pig at 10:00

Why don't you come by at 11?

11, alright thanks

No problem

Can we please do this old dude

Son, I'm going to teach you a
lesson in respecting your elders

Elders, more like
social security recipient

Now if you don't mind my
lady, you can count us down

Ready, set, drink

Go, Go, Go

Done

No, we can't your roommate will hear

So what, I'm going to tell him anyway

It wasn't enough time

What

4 years

4 years of college
and that's all you get

You think it's going to
last forever, but it's not

Between today and the day we die
we never get to go to college again

I walked around campus all last night

Yeah

Everything seemed different

I know

The building the quad,
none if it seemed right

It's like they tell you, you know,
find a major that interests you for a career

Nothing interests me,
I don't want a fucking career

You know what I want my career to be

Playing soccer for the school team

Making out with chicks

You know, drinking beer

Walking around with my
shirt off all day like an idiot

That's what I want my career to be

You know what it is

Suddenly we don't belong here anymore

For 4 years they tell us
this is your home

And then one day you wake up
and you don't belong here anymore

You know what I feel like

Yeah

I feel like Lucifer

I feel like Michael is
chucking me out of paradise

This is the worst day of my life

That was dad on the phone

They're letting us stay at home for the summer
while we learn the banking business

Oh yeah, that sounds horrible

Their picking us up at 6 A.M.

6 A.M.

You know dad, he likes to
get an early start

I can't do it bro'

I can't and I won't

I'm not leaving

What are you talking about

I'm not leaving and neither are you

Dad ain't paying for
another year of college

You got 20 grand because I don't

The school charges rent, you know

I'm not getting a job Evan

We won't get real jobs

We'll coach soccer at the
local soccer camp this summer

Evan, you're my brother and I love you

I'm not leaving you behind

You're really staying

I'm not going anywhere

This is my home

How are we going to pull it off

I have no idea, but I know
I can't do it without you bro'

We in this together, 50-50

O.K. man, I mean, I'm
with you one hundred percent

I don't know how we're
staying, but we're staying

Maybe we'll leave
college one day, but not today

Not today

Evan and I had less than 24 hours
to secure ourselves a 5th year

We knew we needed some help

And if there was one guy in
our fraternity that could help us

It was Greg Karanoski

The guy had been in
college for close to a decade

He was a legend

We called him Fossil

So, we figured if anyone
could help us it would be you

You figured right fellas

I'm an 8 year senior

Triple major, quadruple minor

Currently majoring in the
breeding habits of advanced primates

Basically, I have a quarter million dollars
of education crammed into this skull

Alright Fossil, we don't need
your credentials

Just tell us how we do it,
how do we stay

How to stay

Gentleman, the following
are sacred rules

Fossil's commandments if you will

Rule number 1;
No summer classes ever

The campus is dead and nobody is around

And you're even
getting closer to graduation

Stupid

Secondly, I want the two
of you to enroll in Trigonometry

Trig is arguably the hardest
course that this college has to offer

Wait, wait, wait why do we
want to sign up for a hard class

Because, even your parents are
scared to death of Trigonometry

Therefore, they will be supportive
and understanding when you fail

Obviously, rule number 2

Take Trigonometry
as many times as possible

I have personally failed Trigonometry 5 times

Now that's 15 credit hours

I personally owe an entire
extra semester to Trigonometry

Wow

Rule number 3

Beer is your friend

The more you drink the more
you'll get out of the college experience

However, somewhere around
your 3rd senior year

You should check yourself
into rehab for alcoholism

But don't worry
Your parents won't be angry

I mean you're just a poor, young,
impressionable soul with a problem

They'll actually think you're growing up
because you're seeking help

Besides, at rehab the food is phenomenal

And the babes, they're fucking sluts

Tell Pam I said hi

Alright dude, this is all great stuff

But we don't have any time

We're being picked up
in 20, 19 hours

Do you have any tests left

Yeah, we have our
history 404 final at noon

Fail it

What

Fossil rule number 4

Fail your last test

Your parents have already paid
for 99% of your college education

Do you really think they are going to call it
quits because you've come 3 credits shy

Fuck no

Fail your last test and you'll be right back here
next year taking that same class again in the fall

Dude that might work

Of course it will work

Ah dude thanks Fossil

Fossil you're awesome

Hey, no problem

Now, are we alright here guys

Absolutely, thanks dude

Alright, I don't want to be rude but
I'm going to ask you guys to run along

Scooter's got an 11 o'clock booked

Ah, Scooter you out there

Get back here you pussies, get

Can't leave until the keg is finished

Get back here

You, pledge

Why don't you drink
you skirt wearing pussy

Shove it up your ass bitch

Give me those chips

Give me those chips

Ah, Fuck

I'll shove 'em down your throat

Fuck, Fuck

Give me those chips

Hey, Kegger is getting laid

Yeah, give it to her Kegger

Whoa, is that chick French

Holy shit

They're fags

We're spinning our wheels here Scooter

It's either you're going to
take my advice or you're not

I can't help you if you're too scared

I can't

Sure you can you just
have to be smooth on the phone

I can't

Women can smell fear

That's why it's important
that you act like you don't care

if she's fucking the entire football team

Because you my friend are
having sex with the cheerleading squad

The pom squad, their younger sisters,
their grandmas at home

Everyone in the entire arena
for you fuck her, fuck her

I can't do it Fossil

Scooter, of course you can

I'm going to show you this once,
but only this one time, O.K.

Yeah

Now, I'm going to show you,
but you have to pay attention

Now, what's this girl's name

Kerry

And what's her number

616-555-3836

Wait, you're not
going to call her are you

You want to get laid don't you

No, I mean yeah, I, I, I mean

Alright, now you want to
go out on a date with this girl

Let me set it up

It's ringing

Answering machine

No, hang up hang up

No, no, no, I got this

Hey Kerry, this is Greg
over at the Gamma Chi house

Um, I'm just hanging
out with my buddy Scooter

And he was just telling me what
a beautiful smile he thinks you have

And on top of that he went down to
the gallery and saw some of your work

Now he can't stop talking
about how talented he thinks you are

Well, anyway we are over here just watching
my younger brother and his puppy

Well, anyway if you're interested in
swinging by with some of your friends

Why don't you give me a call

555-9452, talk to you then bye

You're going to get laid tonight
Scooter, panties are going to drop, drop

Dude, we don't have a puppy

Who cares, women being lied to

Hey, as long as I get laid

Laid, oh you will get laid

I think I know this chick

She's put on the old freshmen
15 but let me tell ya

Total freak

O.K. time is up

Put your pencils down and past
your test to the left and forward

Results of the test will
be posted outside my office

I'm going to go to lunch now

When I get back I'm going to
put all these through the scantron

So, the results should be
up in about 2 hours

For all you juniors out there
have a great summer

Seniors, finally your wait is over
and you can join the workforce

Good luck to you all

How did you do on the test

I think I might have got a D minus

Ah, I wouldn't worry about it

You probably came through
with a well deserved F

Yeah, you're right I failed

That's what I'm talking about

Coming back next year bro'

5th year, baby

5th year

Let's go get some fucking chicks

Hey, was that you mud wrestling

Yeah

I saw that shit it was bad ass

Hey, what did you get on the test

Winston

What's up fellas

What's up

I'm pretty sure I aced the test and because
my good old boy Brandon copied off of mine

I'm pretty sure he aced it to

You aced the test, yeah right

Bro, just because I can
drink twice as much beer as you

And bang twice as many chicks as you

Does not mean that
I'm not a 4.0 History major

Hey, my man Winston here
could ace that test in his sleep

I think I did

What's that

Ah, Um, Look you guys want to know
what the correct answers were on the test

Yeah, tell me what was
the answer to number 7

Um, 7 is uh Costa Rica

I got Costa Rica

Me too

Hey, what did you get for
the last one, 1847

Yup, Yup

What about the first one, what
was your answer on the first one.

First one, the, uh, Belize 1472

Oh shit

Look who cares about the test boys

C'mon let's party

Here's the thing, we
tried to throw the test

But the answers we thought
were wrong were right

We should have studied more

Wait, why would we study
for a test we were trying to fail

Because you have to know what the right
answers are in order to pick the wrong ones

Why did you 2 numbnuts even
show up for the exam anyway

Well, so what do we do now Fossil

Fossil rule number 5

Cheat, when all else fails just cheat

Dude it's too late to cheat

And when even cheating fails to work

Rule number 6

Steal the test

Now, logically you would
want to do this before the test

But somehow the two of
you have been defying logic

What I need you to do is
break into your professor's office

Steal the test and change all of
your right answer to the wrong ones

What if we get caught

What if you get caught,
who the fuck cares

What's the worst that can happen to you

They kick you out of school
They're kicking you out tomorrow anyway

Um, what the fuck
you guys looking at me for

I don't have the test

Get out of here you are
interrupting my espresso time

Pick the lock
What?

Pick the lock

What the hell do I know
about picking locks

I thought you knew karate

I got a yellow belt at
the YMCA like 12 years ago

And I don't know what
that has to do with anything

Use your keys then

Use my keys to do what

To pick the lock

I'm pretty sure I don't
have the key to his office

And I don't think the
wrong key is going to work

That's the entire idea behind keys

Use your credit card

Dad cut up our credit cards

Friday 11:22 a.m.

Hey Kerry this is Greg
over at the Gamma Chi house

Um, I'm just hanging out
with my buddy Scooter

And he was just telling me what
a beautiful smile he thinks you have

And on top of that he went down to
the gallery and saw some of your work

Now he can't stop talking about
how talented he thinks you are

Well, anyway we are over here just watching
my younger brother and his puppy

Well, anyway if you're interested in
swinging by with some of your friends

Why don't you give me a call

555-9452, talk to you then bye

You're going to get laid tonight
Scooter, panties are going to drop, drop

Dude, we don't have a puppy

Who cares, women love being lied to

Hey, as long as I get laid

Laid, oh you will get laid

I think I know this chick

She's put on the old freshmen
15 but let me tell ya

Total freak

Scooter

Hey Kerry, hey did you get my message

Yeah you know I sure did

I'm really glad you could make it
We have some beer over here

Goal

Adam, those are holier than thous

Dude, some of them are hot

Um, is that alcohol
that everyone is drinking

Yeah, do you want one or not

I thought you said this was a barbeque

It is a barbeque, do you want one

We don't drink

Why not

We're Christians

Unpucker your assholes

Uh, why that is the rudest

You know Jesus turned
water into wine not mango juice

I'll have a beer

Jane
What, he's right

You know, Christian girls
are best on their knees

You know we should
get that put on a T-shirt

Shut up Jane

I'm thinking about
going to the new gym in town

They have a lot more free weights there

They would let me in for free also

It's good for them to have
a big guy like me there

I'm putting up like 310, 325

Ah, I need another beer
It was nice talking to you though

Wait a minute, hold on

Pledges

Can't you see this women needs a beer

I'm fine really

Get her a beer now

You two give me 20 push ups

Why

Because I said so that's why

Make it 50

Jerk

Great, make it 100

Just go until I say stop

I'm not getting laid now because of
you two little cock blocks

Wait until you meet The General

The General is coming tonight

You, poor that beer down your dress

Kerry was just over at the barbeque

She came right up to me
and kicked me in the balls

Your plan sucked

Dude, calm down

This is great news

How is that possibly great news

Scooter, it is the primal instinct for the
female to kick the male in the genitalia

When ready to mate

This is basically a sign that the female
has chosen her male to reproduce with

Fossil that is the biggest load
of shit I have ever heard

Remember I am an A student in my major

Breeding habits of advanced primates

I'm like the Dahli fucking Lama of this shit

You're an A student

Well, I'm a student

Yeah, right let's move on

Look, you screwed things up

It's all right
I screwed up

What did I do,
I did what you told me to do

Scooter, have you ever seen
a women naked

Yeah, yeah of course I have

Who, when, where

You know, on the uh

T.V., magazines, the internet

You know, lots of times dude

Oh boy, looks like you're going to
need a little more help than I thought

I'm going to have to really reach
into the bag of tricks for this one

Do you have anyone else in mind

I don't know

I want to get laid

But I really like Kerry

You've already screwed
things up with Kerry

Do you have anything else in mind

Well I don't know if I want anyone else
Fossil

I mean I really like her

Oh, that's cute

Now, man up, grab your sack

And let's figure out how to
get your dipstick into some oil

Alright, we'll need some tight shirts

Expensive shoes, tight pair of jeans

Maybe a little man perfume

Huh, What am I going to
need that stuff for

Because you're going to pretend to be gay

What, no Fossil
Fuck no

Scooter, I pretended to be
gay my entire 3rd senior year

I got laid more than carpet

You meet a girl, become best friends

Go shopping, maybe get a facial

And then you give them the line

I could never imagine myself with a woman

Next thing you know
they're on top of you

Congratulations bro,
for the second time

Who would of thought failing
a test would be so much work

Hey Jeff, Jeff

What happened to your skirt man

Sir, Pledge Master Kegger instructed
me to pour beer down my pants, sir

Alright, that's enough with the sir business

You can just call me Jake
Alright

Man, that Kegger guy
is a complete asshole

Yeah, he can be

But you didn't hear that from us

Jeff go up into my room and
grab yourself a clean pair of pants

Thanks you, sir

Uh, Jake, thanks

Are we going to have to
really drown a kitten tonight

Come here

Do you really think that my brother
and I would be in this frat if we did

Look, it's going to be tough tonight

But you're going to get through it

And it's going to be totally worth it

Thanks a lot guys

Can I get you guys a beer

Yeah sure I'll take another brew

Yeah, me too
Take your time

Thanks guys

Hey babe I'm Freddie

I like your style sexy

Um, look it's not what it looks like alright

It's alright honey

I had trouble coming
out of the closet for years

I'm not in the closet

I don't even own a closet

You know I have one of those poles
on my wall to hang my clothes on

Look this is just a plan O.K.

I'm not gay I'm trying to get laid

Will you please just let me go

Hey, take it easy

We just met

Let's take things a little slower

And there will be plenty of time for lovin

Oh yeah

Hey guys do you want one

One what exactly

Hey common let's go
and make sure we failed

Are the hot dogs done yet

No baby and neither are you

Alright people excuse me pardon me

Hey what the fuck

Frat boys, what are you doing

Hey my name is on that

My grade's on there

We need to see our grade

You said Winston was a History major

He is a History major

Hey, then why didn't he know
any of the right answers to the test

You're a History major why
didn't you know any of the wrong ones

Ah shut up Evan

Dude you wanted to take History
in the first place

Yeah, to take it not to pass it

Fuck you know we had all
the answers wrong and we failed

But we had to go back and
change all the answers because of you

You wanted to change them to Jake

Yeah, but I wouldn't have wanted to if you
hadn't have talked to Winston in the first place

Dude we both talked to Winston

Winston came up to both of us and said hi

No, you went up to Winston and
said hey what did you get on the test

Yeah

Fuck
Sorry

You know were like 13, 14 hours away
from becoming financial bankers

Let's go see Fossil

So let me see if I'm getting this here

You originally had all the answers wrong

But for some reason
thought you had all the answers right

So you broke into your professor's office
Stole the test

Changed all your answers to
what you thought were the wrong answers

But actually changed them to the
right answers and then passed the test

Am I getting this

Yeah that about covers it

How in the fuck is that possible

I have no idea

What did you get

A-

Straight A

So what do we do now

Alright, I didn't want to
have to go in this direction

But you guys have to get some
scholarships

Dude I barely pulled a C average

I got a 2.3 and for the last 4 years
have done absolutely no community service

I've never helped out in any group
or organization in any fucking way

Do I look like an A student to you

I don't even know where the fuck
I slept last night

But I do know I have tons of scholarships
rolling in each and every semester

How's that

Rule number 7

Hit on high school chicks

Get one to ask you to prom

Dude were 22 years old

We're not going to prom

Ever heard the expression off
like a prom dress

I believe it speaks for itself

Well, anyway if you go to prom
in a tuxedo

And your date wears a dress
made of duct tape

You can basically win up to $2,500
in scholarship money for college

I'm the 3 year reigning scholarship winner

I don't believe this guy

No way

This is a load of crap

No seriously it's a real scholarship

Now I've already been invited
to prom this year

But just so you guys know I did invite
a couple of high school chicks today

Actually even a few hot ones at
the barbeque right now

No shit

No shit I'm the shit

Rule number 8

You don't have to be sober to cook

I am an excellent cook

You can't cook

Ever heard of Fossil's famous cherry pie

No, he does make a mean cherry pie
I'll give him that

The guy makes a hell of a cherry pie

You're damn right I do

You're looking at the 2005 2006
Mr. Cherry Pie Scholarship Award Winner

That's a cool grand each year for college

You can't cook

That's not even a real scholarship

You bet your ass it is

Basically I just bake a little weed
into the pie

Judges will vote for anything if their high

Fossil rule number 9

It's not a lie if you believe it

Basically just tell a lie so many times
that even you forget if it's the truth or not

For example I'm getting scholarships
for Cancer, Leukemia, Tuberculosis

I think I'm getting one for
being a single parent

But it's up to you guys to figure out
what your story is going to be

What the lie is going to be

So, if you guys don't mind

Go get some scholarships

It's time for me to take my meds

Did I mention I have glaucoma

So, what high school do you go to

Oh, I go to East and my
best friend Joy she goes to East

But now she goes to CC

And she promised to be
best friends forever

But I'm not sure anymore

Because she's friends
with this girl named Paula

And Paula's a total bitch

And I really wanted to go to the
mall one day and she wouldn't let me go

So, so your high school

Does it have a prom
Oh yeah

Wait, whoa

Are you asking me to go to prom

Yeah

Oh my God, Oh my God

Joyce is going to be so jealous
I'm going to prom with a college guy

I have to tell her right now

Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God

So, I was thinking
about what we could wear

There's this scholarship
Yeah, I got this pink dress with a white trim on it

And it's going to cost
about $300 of your money

Because it's from a really
expensive store I really like

But I haven't even been there in years
And I really want to go there

Actually I was thinking
we could both go in duct tape

But duct tape doesn't come in pink

Besides I have this black
tux for you with a pink cumber bun

And we're going to totally match

And your twin should
really go with my best friend

So we can go to this
really expensive restaurant

Because I totally don't want
to eat and not look fat in my dress

And I want to get their late so I
look like the shit when I get to the ball

Do you have any idea
what just happened to me

Did you get laid

No, my God no I didn't get laid

Did you at least get close

Yeah we got to first base

Rounded 2nd and thank God
we didn't get to 3rd

Just calling to invite you to our pursuit of worldly
knowledge with handcuffs party tonight

Anyway, I don't blame you for

Forget about that looser

Come over tonight

Handcuff yourself to me and

Dear Ushmad and Ashot

Fuck

Their grandma died
So?

So, they have to go home for a year

We can't use them to go to college

Why did she have to die

No, no

Every single rule Fossil had entrusted in us

Turned out to be a complete
God damn disaster

Somehow we always ended up
worse than when we started

It's all over

It's 5 o'clock and our parents
are coming in 13 hours

And we have absolutely no options left

Today was really going to be
our last day of college

Well, might as well smoke a bowl
and get laid

So Kegger, Brandon told me that
you fucked a pledge today dude

No, you fucked the pledge

Oh yeah me, no

He had his legs all straddled up
around you

Don't listen to this shit
Don't listen to that shit

C'mon little bro'

Ah yeah pass it to the left

Yeah let's go pass it to the left

No to the right

You know what you're like
a 400 pound light weight

So, I'll see you your fucking socks
And I'll raise you my boxers for your panties

Panties, let's see some panties

Girls what are we going to do now

You're the only one not naked

C'mon lets go
Ah yeah

Mom, Dad

You look messy

How are my soon to be graduate boys

Well mom

Great to see you son

Great to see you sir

Son, are you O.K.

Ah, he's fine sir

Mom, how are you

Good Jake

It's so good to see you

Let's go inside so I can start
packing your clothes

Well, I thought that you
and Dad would be here at 6 A.M.

Like we talked about
on the phone Right Dad

I thought I'd allow your mother a head start on
packing your clothes, moving stuff out of the room

Wow, what a great surprise

We can't

Well why not

Because

Because we have a meeting
across campus in 20 minutes

With a History Professor

Really, which professor

Ah, History Professor Hughes

Professor Hughes

H-U-G-H-E-S

Yeah, that's right
Do you know him

Sounds familiar

But I've never met a
History Professor Hughes before

You weren't going to see the
professor looking like that were you

No, no I thought we had left our
nice clothes out here on the porch

Well, looks like we didn't

We're just going to go inside
and throw something on

I got a great idea

Why don't you and Mom come over
the History House in 20 minutes

You can sit in on the meeting with us

Dude, we don't have no meeting

Ah, ouch, stop

We're just going to throw on some clothes

We'll be back in 20 minutes sir

Son, we'll just come inside
with you and wait until you change

And then all of us will
go over there together

Well, Dad I thought that Mom
might want to see the Flower Grove

They are in full blossom this time of year

They are absolutely beautiful

Our college ranked number 1 best
flowers in the country

It's going to be dark in 20 minutes

Wouldn't you like to see them Mom

Ah Jake

It's so nice of you to think of me

C'mon, let's go

Alright then we'll see in the front entrance
of the History House in 20 minutes. Sharp

Yes sir

Fossil, I'm in way too deep

I told my parents that we have a meeting with
Professor Hughes over at the History Office

It's all a lie
How could they have showed up early

Life as a college student
is finished, done, over

Is Evan stoned

You know I always knew I'd
have to deal with this moment

But I feel like I'm at a funeral
only it's my funeral

It's O.K. Jake
It's alright

What are you consoling me
for your life is over to you moron

Ah, it seems that your parents have
shown up a little earlier than expected

What, my parents are here

Yeah, snap out of it

I had to cover for you because Mom
and Dad wanted to come into the house

It smells like a God damn reggae party

You screwed up dude

I screwed up
What did you do?
What did I do?

The only thing I did is save your ass

Save my ass

Yeah, save your ass

No man, sounds like you
made things unnecessarily worse

You know what, you don't even know
what lie I even told Mom and Dad

And you were standing right there
you fucking moron - Enough!

The two of you are going home from
college and never coming back again ever

Now Jake, what did you tell your parents

I told them we had a meeting with
Professor Hughes at the History Office

Did you tell your parents what the
meeting was about. - No

Alright, what were your plans
once you got to the History House

I don't have any plans

I figured I'd just go over there and tell them
that the meeting got cancelled or something

Alright, well do either of your
parents know Professor Hughes

Or know what he looks like

No, there is no Professor Hughes
I made the name up

Put the God damn fish bowl down

And are there any pictures of Professor Humes
anywhere on the first floor of the History House

No, are you listening
There is no Professor Hughes

There is now

Rule number 10

When all else fails impersonate a professor

Forcibly if needed

Gentlemen, I am Professor Humes

No, it's Hughes H-U Hughes

Yeah, yeah, yeah whatever

Alright Jake, Evan, I need you two
to head over to the History Office

Hold them off for just a little bit

I'm going to throw on a suit

I'll get over there as quick as I can

I'm going to help you out of this

Get the fuck off me

Get the fuck off me
Let's go

Gotcha
What?

Kerry what are you doing

You're getting what you asked for

You wanted to hang out with me tonight

And now you got me

Yeah tonight, later, um

Can you please unlock me

I don't have the key

It's in my dorm room

Where we should end up tonight

Ah, fuck, alright

Just, just come with me

Where are we going

You must be Mr. Tanner

It's a pleasure to meet you sir
Hi

I am obviously Professor Hughes

What the hell is going on here
Oh, how rude of me

Mr. and Mrs. Tanner this is Kerry

Kerry, this is Mr. and Mrs. Tanner

Nice to meet you dear

I love the shirt

You're probably wondering why
Kerry and I are handcuffed together

Well, um, we are handcuffed this

This is for charity

Charity

He's lying
I'm a whore

Um, theatre students

Great imagination

Well, what Kerry is trying to get at is

The school has decided to handcuff a professor
with a student to raise money for cancer

That's nice

Who in the world thought of the idea to
handcuff a female student with a male teacher

Well, we believe in outside the box
thinking here

Well as you both already know

Both Jake and Evan are special students

They're actually 2 of
the tops in my class

Must be a pathetic class

Pathetically challenging historical wise

Well, today I would like to offer both Jake and
Evan my coveted teaching assistant positions

Absolutely

Yeah, absolutely, yeah

Don't worry about it guys you earned it

I'm actually pretty excited that
you decided to accept the postions

Does anybody else need a drink

Now is not the time to drink

Just take a drink Greg

I don't want a drink

If you don't take a drink
I'll scream and scream and scream

Fine, I will take a drink

Here

I don't want any

I'm not so sure that this is
the best thing for Jake and Evan to do

They were planning at working at a bank

Trust me Mom, Dad

There is nothing more Jake and I
want more than to be here next year

Well, I suppose

As long as it's what you want to do

I guess it sounds like a good opportunity

What are you going to do for money

Where are you going to stay

When do you start

Mr. Tanner, your sons will be begin preparing
my next year's curriculum as soon as this Monday

They'll be here all summer

All through next year

And as far as some of your other concerns

They

As far as some of your other concerns
they can live on campus housing for free

Otherwise they can, Huh

They, there is going to be a
small fee of $1,500 per student

Just basically to lock in
the positions for next year

That will need to be taken care of today

Alright then

Who do I make the check out to

That's Greg Karanowski

K-A-R-A-N

I thought your last name was Hughes

Hughes is just a nickname

Ah, I'm so proud of you boys

Thank you Mom
Thanks a lot sir

Well, looks like you both
have busy schedules ahead of you

I guess Mom and I will head back
to the hotel and head back tomorrow

Thanks a lot Professor Hughes

And if you don't mind

Actually Kerry and I also need to leave

We're going to have sex

Oh, but it's for charity

I'll tell you

These professors could
never survive in the real world

Yes dude I can't believe that shit worked

Fossil you did it man

No problem boys

Do you guys mind

Oh, yeah, yeah we're leaving

Hey can we just grab that $3000 first

I'm sorry, what

That $3,000 that you got from our Dad
to pay for our room and board next year

For you

That's my 3 G's boys

Cha Ching
I'm coming back for year 9 bitches

Wait a second

You're stealing money from our Dad

You know now is really not a good time
to talk about this

You know I'm about ready to bring out the
ole Fossil bone if ya know what I'm saying

I know what you're saying

Take another drink first

Don't let the door hit
your ass on the way out boys

It's 10 P.M.

Time for hell night

Tonight we welcome back
all of our past pledge masters

They'll help us activate our pledges

And bring them into the
brotherhood of Iota Gamma Chi

I think the old farts really
enjoy taking a break from their lives

To spend one more weekend in the
fraternity

I, I, I, Iota Gamma Chi

You want to dance

I want to get in your pants

Oh, yeah, O.K.

I love this boys

We're in this really deep bro'

I know

Do you miss this much

What's that

This place, college, the fraternity

No, I mean don't get me wrong
I had a great time when I was here

But, I'm pretty happy with my life

What about the girls

Ah yeah sure, I mean, sleeping
with a different co-ed every weekend

It has got its appeal

But I have a beautiful wife

Couple of great kids

So, overall, no I don't miss it

You guys are graduating tomorrow right

Yeah, well, no

I mean we were supposed but

I think we figured out a way to stay

Stay and do what

Stay, live in the frat and party

I'm putting you into retirement grandpa

If you want to quit just ask for mercy

Oh, no c'mon Greg you can do it, drink

You know Greg, Fossil,
or whatever you call him

You think he's the king of campus

I bet if you'd ask most of the students
here they would think that he is a joke

He's a joke to the alumni

You know I pledged with him

He's cool to your face

But you turnaround and
he'll stab you in the back

Your right

He screwed over Scooter today

He took $3,000 from our Dad

I really feel sorry for the guy

He's stuck

He has no idea which direction
to take his life

And every year that goes by he
just becomes more and more pathetic

And he knows it

Oh my God

Wait Kegger, you were
just drinking water like me right

No, hundred proof vodka all night

I had to beat him fair and square

You guys want to know
what the secret to life is

What's that

Make a career out of something you love

Something you have passion for man

So what do you do

Me, I love sports

I majored in sports
management when I was here

And then it was off to major league soccer

6 months ago I bought an interest
in the Chicago Fire soccer team

You serious
The Fire's our favorite team

Evan and I play soccer

We've been team captains for
the past 3 years, all conference

I'll tell you what

If you guys are interested

Why don't you guys come by the stadium

Work out with the team

Give me a call tomorrow and
I'll put you in touch with some coaches

Dude, we'll definitely call you

Hey man, I'm still a Gamma

And I'll do anything to help out a brother

Well I got to get back to the wife

You guys take it easy

Thanks for letting me stop by

Anytime

Oh God

Here, I got the key

You all right
Thank you

We did it

Let's get out of here

Here's your hot dog eating contest bitch

Ladies, you want to get us some beers

Yeah buddy, those chicks are hot

What's up Winston, Brandon

What's up brothers
How are you doing

Hey dude it turns out that
you're not that smart at history

Actually man I'm plenty smart

I failed that test on
purpose and so did Brandon here man

What the hell are you talking about

We don't want to graduate

Everyone knows that if
you fail your last final

That your parents will pay to
send you back for another semester

Bro' my parents paid for 4 full years of tuition

Do you really think that
they are going to let me come

3 credits shy of graduation and call it quits

Not a chance man

Dude I can't believe these
2 fuckers didn't know that

Bro' we're coming back for another year

5th year baby

5th year

See you boys later

Shmucks

Ah, he shit himself

What a loser

Hello, who the hell is this
in the middle of the black night

Yes sir it's me, and Evan's here to

Harold, Harold who is it

Nobody, go back to sleep

Jake, I've been thinking

I'm going to look into that crackpot professor's
credentials first thing in the morning

Actually Dad, don't even worry about it

Evan and I don't want to
become teacher's assistants anyway

Good, now let me get off the damn
telephone and let me go back to bed

Harold, language

Sir, we have a tryout with a
major league soccer team next week

Soccer

Now listen that's enough games
at 3:00 in the morning

I'm picking you and your
idiot brother up at 6 A.M.

And that's the end of it

No sir, we're going our
own way and that's the end of it

So make sure that you cancel that check

You're going your own way

Yes sir

You know this is the
first time you ever stood up to me

Finally grew up a little bit huh

Well I guess the banking
business isn't going anywhere

You give your mother a call
tomorrow afternoon

We will

And Jake

Sir

You give me a call after
those soccer tryouts

If you put your mind to it you can do it

You and Evan both

He actually took it alright

Hey what time is it

It's about 3 A.M.

You think there's any chicks downstairs

A couple drunk ones

Works for me

Me too

Idiot kids

You can have me if you want me

I'm a little nervous

It will come naturally

I'm a man

Subtitles: Arigon

Hey

Evan, what's up man

I was thinking man

We should have one more
game while we're still in college

Alright

Let's go

So that's it

That's our story

I'd like to tell you that we went on

Played major league soccer in Chicago

Maybe we'll make the team

Maybe we won't

I don't know what's going to happen next

But I'll tell you this much

Whatever happens

We'll never end up like Fossil

With a dick in our mouths

Hey, good luck with those soccer tryouts

I know you'll do a good job

I hope so, I'm really excited

Ah, good God

Hey, by the way

Your grandma's dead

No
