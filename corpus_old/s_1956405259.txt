<i>â™ª There's a child
For every doll â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And a doll for every child â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They somehow
Find each other â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When destiny has smiled â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who knows just how
They're chosen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The stories seldom say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It could happen any moment</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª And today could be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The day</i> â™ª

Yo, wake up, Moxy.

I've been up for hours.

Today could be the day!

<i>â™ª Hello, gorgeous Let's check

<i>â™ª You're pinkish red
Got this thing on your head â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And, whoa â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Girl, you couldn't
Look better â™ª</i>

Hey!
Hey, Moxy. You're in a good mood.

That's because today
I'm going to...

Get chosen and go to the Big
World and be with your child.

You say that every day.

I know. But today
I might be right.

<i>â™ª Shake the sleep off And

<i>â™ª Life just couldn't
Be better than this â™ª</i>

[announcer] Ice Bat wins!
[crowd cheers]

Ice cream on me!


Here you go, Mayor Ox.
Hot off the press.

Thanks, Moxy.
Today's the day.

You really think so?

When someone gets chosen,
do they get picked up

by a long stretch dune buggy
or something fancy?

I'm talking about
the tree planting ceremony.

Oh...
Mr. Tree, if you would.

Now, I've told you before:
All this business

about the so-called
Big World and children,

those are just stories!

Everyone says that,
but what's the harm in believing?

<i>â™ª Never mind that â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'll tell you
What the day will bring â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª First a shindig, then a bash
Then more partying â™ª</i>

But, Ox...
[crowd] Go! Go! Go!

<i>â™ª Top it all with a rave
Then a ball â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoa â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Right, you know
It couldn't be better â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Mornin', Moxy Got something
new You'll wanna try â™ª</i>

Hi, Wage!
â™ª <i>It's a brownie-cupcake Fudge-berry ice-cream pie â™ª</i>

[Moxy] Yum!
<i>â™ª Just one bite â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Who needs kids, am I right â™ª</i>

Babo!

Couldn't taste better â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And soon
You-know-what is comin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But until it arrives Might as
well Keep the party hummin' â™ª</i>

Yeehaw!

<i>â™ª Yes, it's a square-peg life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In a round-hole town â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But the folks
Couldn't be any sweeter â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It may be upside-backwards
And wrong-side down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But it just couldn't feel
More completer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And there's so much to do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it's all such bliss â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's no reason to fret What
could ever Be better than this? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No, it couldn't
Get better than... â™ª</i>

[announcer over PA]
<i>Incoming! Incoming!</i>

It's going down!

[announcer over PA] <i>Incoming! Incoming!</i>
[crowd clamoring]

New UglyDoll comin' in hot!
Willard, shake a leg!

You heard the mayor, Willard.
Get moving.

In three.
[Peggy] You got this, Willard.

[all] Two.
[Wage] Does he, though?



Whoa! Aah!



We're gonna need
a bigger Willard.

Or maybe not a tortoise.

Is this where I get chosen

to go to the Big World?
[gasps]

What's your name?

[Peggy] Flattop! Crew Cut!
[female Ugly] Smushhead!

Wedgehead?
Great! I love literal naming!

Isn't that right,
Gibberish Cat?


Everyone, let's give
our new neighbor a tour.

I'll show her around.

<i>â™ª Story of the day
The month, the year â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Here's a scoop
On the way down-low â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Check out the flow â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Cats are rappin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lobsters snappin' â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Only the dog â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Makes the party happen â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Put it in your paper â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sealed with a kiss â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Couldn't be better Than this â™ª</i>

[all singing]
<i>â™ª Another madhouse night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª In a crazy-quilt world â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And our hearts couldn't soar
Any higher â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We got our freak flags
Flying completely unfurled â™ª</i>

[laughing]
<i>â™ª And we just couldn't be More on fire â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And life's a nonstop blast â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's utter awesomeness â™ª</i>
[laughs]

<i>â™ª Yeah, it's crazy, you bet But
it couldn't get Better than this â™ª</i>

Food fight!
[laughing, clamoring]

<i>â™ª What could ever be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What could ever be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Better â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Than this â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Couldn't be
Better than this â™ª</i>

Except maybe
for the Big World.

[clears throat]
I heard that.

Now, Moxy, I've lived here
longer than anyone,

and it really does not get
any better than this.

Look, you know I love it here.

It's not about that.

It's just...
haven't you ever felt like,

even if you're happy,
which I definitely am...

<i>I mean, I just spent an
entire day singing about it...</i>

<i>there's still
something else,</i>

there's something more
you're supposed to be doing?


Good night, Ox. [kisses]

Lucky Bat, see you tomorrow.

Maybe it'll be the day.

I just don't want to see
her heart get broken

when this impossible dream
of hers doesn't come true.

Maybe I could talk to her.

Oh, please,
Lucky, give it a try.

We've run out of options here.
She doesn't listen to me.

I've done everything I can do.

I'll give it a try.
For you... and Moxy.

<i>â™ª Guess another sun has set â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And another moon Has smiled â™ª</i>
[fireworks bursting]

<i>â™ª I'm still just
One more doll â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Still waiting
For her child â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm sure it's gonna happen â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just like the stories say â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's a new day
'Round the corner â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it just might be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The day â™ª</i>

[Lucky Bat] Moxy! Thanks for accepting
my random yet urgent invitation.

How are things?
[Moxy] Well...

Every day I think:
"Today's the day."

And then it isn't.

And that's fine, it is, but...

Look, I've always believed
the Big World is real.

I know I'll find
the perfect kid for me.

But lately
I'm starting to wonder

with no evidence, no proof,

what if it's not true?

Hmm.

[fortune cookie snaps]

"Find your own truth...

6, 9, 25,

18, 36, 41."

Whoa. [mimics explosion]

This is why you're
the wisest doll in town.

You're so right.
I have to believe in myself.

Uh... sure.

So how do I do that?
Specifically?

Uh, well,
a wiser doll than me would say

you should stop listening
to what others tell you.

But all I have
to offer you now is some...

Satisfaction Guaran-tea.

Oh! You want to read
my tea leaves! Of course!

Um, you know,
reading tea leaves is not...

it's not really my thing.

But I can tell you that your
forehead looks nice and bright.

And that's good luck.

So take that good luck
and believe in yourself

from the comfort
of your own home.

What do you see?

Uh...

You...
"You"?

Oh! You mean me.

It's not what you see,
but what I see.

Hmm...

I see leaves.

Leaves! I need to leave!

All this time I've been
waiting for my kid to find me,

but I should find my kid!

Wait, what? That's not
what I was saying at all!

Thank you so much, Lucky!
You're so wise. So wise!

Well, I'm just lucky...
Come on!

Moxy, I think you may have misinterpreted
the spirit of what I was trying to...

[Moxy] Ugly Dog, let's go.
Yeah! I know that look. Wait up!

[Lucky Bat]
Yes, let's wait up!

Babo! Lucky Bat
has a great new idea.

No, no...
We're gonna make our dreams come true!

I'm always geared up
for dreams.

[Lucky Bat] Or nightmares!
[Moxy] Wage! Today's the day!

But, Moxy!

Come on!
[sighs] Here we go again.

[Lucky Bat] Can't we just
hit pause real quick?


Oh! Hello, Moxy.

Looks like you're all
having a good time.

Oh, loads of fun. Lucky Bat
made everything crystal clear.

Hey, Lucky! Attabat!
[Lucky Bat squeals]

our dreams come true!

Everything that comes
to Uglyville arrives here.

So if we're going to find
the Big World,

it's only logical
we start here.

Okay, the Big World
and children do not exist.

I just wanna have a look inside
that flower. Who's with me?


I'm in!
Me, too!

[Wage] Traitors.
Eh?

Come on. Come on over here.

Hit me.

Just a quick look.
And then we'll turn back.

Yes! You guys are the ugliest.

Now the only question is:
how do we get up there?

[Babo laughs]
[Wage, Lucky Bat yelp]

Hey!

Whoa!

Eh, I got nothing.

Hmm. We need something

that could grip onto the edge
nice and tight.

Even then, it would still need
to hold all our weight.

Huh?

No, no. No.

No!


Anytime now, guys. Let's go.



Oh, good. A terrifying void.

That's always a good sign.

[Ugly Dog]
This is what the inside

of a flower looks like?

Yeah, dark and creepy.

All right, that's it.
Let's go.

to UglyDolls On Ice tonight?


this week's episode of
<i>Uglyville's Got No Talent.</i>

Moxy?

Let's just call it a day, huh?

You guys,
this pipe goes somewhere.

Say something to her.

Um... [clears throat]

Sometimes, the insides
of our dreams are hollow.

Like this pipe, for example.
[scoffs]

Hollow, huh?

I guess a girl can dream.

We'll just go on back
like a bunch of go-on-backers.

I just gotta see
what it's like!

I think we probably should
have expected her to do that.

Here we go.
[Wage] Moxy. Moxy!

Slow down. You're gonna slip.

It's dangerous!
[panting]


[continues panting]

Come on, guys! Come on!

Um...

I guess not.

Guys. What if this is the way
to the Big World?

But Ox says there is
no Big World and he...

He didn't know there was something
else out there. But we do.

This pipe? It's real,
and it has to lead somewhere.

Maybe it's the Big World.

If anyone can figure it out,
it's us.

Lucky, what could make you wiser than
solving the ultimate unsolved mystery?

Hello! Mystery ahead!

And, Ugly Dog,
you're my best friend.

Well, that's just hurtful.

Are you really going
to let me go in alone?

You ain't goin' alone.


And when someone needs help,

who y'all gonna call?

Babo, that's who!

I gotta say, she gets me.

Hmm. I suppose a little
journey could be enlightening.

This is ridiculous!

Going into a creepy pipe

that spells certain doom?

No. No, thank you!

Wage.

Go ahead.
Give me your big sell, Moxy.

Tell me that I have to go.

It's my duty as a doll
to be a friend.

Tell me that deep down I want
to know what's over there, too.

Come on. Give me the pitch!

If you don't come,

you're going to have
to climb down that cliff

all by yourself.

Good pitch.

Let's just let the record show
that I am against this.

[all cheer]
Now, that's what I'm talking about, Wage.

[Babo straining]
[Wage] Slow down, Blobby.

[Babo] It's Babo.
[Wage] I know your name.

There are so many tunnels.

[Ugly Dog] What
we really need is a light.


we been walking in the dark

for the last hour, then?

I'm conserving the batteries

until we really need it.

know when you come upon a time

when you really need it.


[sniffing]
You smell anything?

It's hard to say.

It'd be easier
if I had a nose.

[all scream]


Whoa! Creepy falling babies!

Oh, no! Oh, no.

Huh? [gasp]

[Moxy laughs]

[laughing, cheering]
Whoo! Yes!

Hey, look at me go!


I'm freakin' out.

Breathe in deep.

[inhales]
Very calmly!


And exhale.

Blehh! Blehh!

Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

Let's do it again! [laughs]

[chuckles]
Another swing, another miss.

These skirts
look so pretty on us.

But are they absorbent?



Just imagine, Uglies.

All our dreams are waiting
for us right through there.

Nothing, and I mean nothing,

Ew! What are those?

Is that supposed to be
some kind of dog?

Lou is so not

"I do not like this.

Real bad.

<i>â™ª Imagine how you'd traumatize
Some unsuspecting youth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ugly â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And that's the ugly truth â™ª</i>

Whoo!

<i>â™ª That's just the ugly truth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, you're U-G-L-Y â™ª</i>

I really do feel bad for you,
but kids just don't want ugly.

So I'm not sure where you
belong, but it's not here.

<i>â™ª And that's the ugly â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Truth â™ª</i>

[male doll] That man can entertain and
emotionally devastate like no one else.

Whoo-hoo!

Come on, Moxy. Let's go home.

to carry you home, too?

Okay, just let me know.

little hearts. Such a shame.

It is kinda sad, though.

Of course, "sad" in, like,
a totally, totally shameful way.

Obviously.

Moxy.

You know what?
We're not going anywhere.

[all gasp]
What are you doing?

Have you lost your mind?

We don't belong here.

We've come this far.

Um... come again?

We're gonna train
and go to the Big World.

We're just as lovable
as any of you.

And we're gonna
prove you wrong.

Before we decide to do this,
shouldn't we tell Ox?

Ox? Who is Ox?

Well, he's the founder and mayor
of our town, where we live.

So there's
a whole town of Uglies?

It's called Uglyville.

I guess they're
into literal naming.

None of this matters. Okay?

Only Pretty Dolls can run
the Gauntlet. Rules are rules.

What rules?

Uh...
[robot] Did someone say "rules"?

It says right here in section 43...
Oh! You know what? Stay here.

Seriously?
[Lou] Yes.

What kind of amazingly
benevolent leader would I be

if I denied fellow dolls a
chance to fulfill their dreams?

Mandy, show our special guests
their quarters.

May I suggest
the Supply Suite.

Sweet!

I have a reputation to maintain,
so I let you skate by this time.

Enjoy this moment.

Because it doesn't
get better than this.

That's the name of our song.

Find out everything you can
about their town

and report back to me
tomorrow night.

Night? Like a date?
No.

But there is one more thing
I need you to do.

UglyDolls.

<i>â™ª I'll crush them all â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Destroy their dream â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To save my perfect empire
Nothing's too extreme â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I know how to do it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Without looking
Too uncouth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A plan that's
So foul, gross â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hideous, nasty â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They'll never see the ugly â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Truth â™ª</i>

"Doll Type 12."

Everything is so different here.
[Wage] I'd say.

actually live in these boxes?

Not that they're bad boxes.

They're all neat and organized
and straight...

and symmetrical
and clean and...

Whew.

I'm okay.


Silly tree. Oh, my goodness.

Okay. This way, please.


That would be the supply she...

I mean suite.
Your home away from home.

We are staying there?


[Ugly Dog] Am I the only one seeing this?
It's so industrial chic.

"Industrial chic"? It's a shed.
I mean, there's boxes and a mop.

Dibs on the mop
and the bucket of dirty water.

Check out my spare tire.
It matches my other tire.

This place is perfect for us.
Hey, hey, guys.

I'm really glad
you like it and all.

But I didn't get your names.

Sorry. I'm Moxy.
Babo.

Lucky Bat.
Wage.

Folks call me Ugly Dog.
Because that's his name.

But those close to me call me Slick Dog.
Which is not his name.

Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.


So are you really here just
to train for the Big World?

Yup.
You bet!

And we're all gonna end up with
our own special kid to love.

You do know that Lou is gonna
make it super hard, right?

Well, I say bring it on,
Louis.

He means well, of course.

Though he can be a bit judgmental.
Ya think?

Still, without
his constructive criticism,

none of us
would ever get anywhere.

So just stay on his good side.


Cool glasses.
I always wanted some specs.

Ooh, yeah! I feel smarter already!
[Mandy] Excuse me!

No!
Do I look wiser?

Oh, yeah!
No! Please, just... Please!


We're sorry.

Please don't say anything,
guys.

Especially not to Lou.

Lots of dolls
wear glasses in Uglyville.

Even Five-Eyed Steve.

This is
the Institute of Perfection,

and Perfect Dolls
have perfect eyesight.

[grunt]
[UglyDolls] Oh!

Man, and I thought
I had issues.

Do you feel
that electricity between us?

Watch this.
She's gonna turn around.

She's gonna turn around.

She's doing the old
"don't turn around" move.

Well, she didn't need glasses
to see through you.

Whoa!

Hey, Mandy!
[screams]

Sorry.

I think your glasses
look special.

They make you who you are.

Yeah, but...

No butts about it!

[both giggle]


Are you kidding me?

First that dark, greasy pipe,

and now we have
to go down there?

Yeah, maybe someone
down there

can tell us where Uglyville is.
[scoffs]

Lowering, lowering, lowering.

Creeping, creeping, creeping.

Sneaking, sneaking...

if you say it.

Huh?

Huh?

Huh?


Evenin'. Lookin' ugly.

Check me. Am I ugly?
Come on.

rolling, rolling, rolling.


[faint cheering]

Go, go, go! Come on, Willard.
I got a lot of buttons riding on you.

Come on!
Do it for Five-Eyed Steve!

This place is definitely ugly,
that's for sure.

Hey, Tuesday, jot that down.

Yas! Lou's gonna be like,

"You guys are
the awesome-est spies ever."

And then he'll love me.

And the winner is Wedgehead,
by a wedge.

Thanks, Mayor Ox!

Is that a bunny or something?

Oh, I love bunnies.


And there he goes. Let's move!

Get him into the bag, up the pipe,
and we're on our way back to Lou.

Easy-peasy. Any questions?
Yes! As a matter of fact.

Are those my earrings?
Yes. Any more questions?

How could you take them
without asking me?

It was super easy.

Oh, no, no. Don't cry, Lydia.
It'll give you frown lines.

Attagirl.
It's no big deal, right?

I mean, it's not like
I borrowed your lip gloss.

Wait, is that my lip gloss?

Whoa, is that the time? Getting late.
Let's do this. Synchronize!

That's my watch!
It is, but it looks better on me.

Come on.

[sighs] It does look good on her.
I know, right?


Hmm...

[yelps, grunts]

Whoa! [grunts]

Whoo!
Got the Ugly rabbit thing.

Ow!

in the sack, huh?


I'm a natural ear runner.
You'll never catch me...


[grunts]
[Lydia] Good thing for that random rake.

Just like we planned it.

Now tell us
where Uglyville is!

Today you begin your training.

And I know
that seems stressful,

maybe a little scary.

But remember: This is
your purpose as a doll.

And I would never
let you fail.

I've dedicated my entire life to
making sure you go to the Big World.

That's right.
I'm doing this for you.

And you. And you.

Me?
Yes, you!

Wait, so that whole "You're
ugly, you're trash" song,

that was because you loved me?

Of course I love you.
I love all of you.

And I will take you there!


I wanna hate him.
I mean, I really wanna dislike this guy.

But I gotta respect
the man's fireworks budget.

I'm so awesome.

But I'm here
to get you pretty.

Because pretty makes perfect.

And I don't know about you,

but that sounds
pretty great to me!

<i>â™ª So let's get started â™ª</i>

Do you want your clothes ruined
by a tea party gone awry?

Do you want to find yourself on the
business end of a permanent marker?

No!
And you!

Huh?
Your kid spent an hour styling your hair.

But then, disaster strikes.

Who's gonna get the gum out?
Who?

I don't know!

Today you're going to
practice how to avoid stains,

smudges, and spills.

Or as I like to call them:
"The S's of Messes."

[polite laughter]
Thank you.

I actually came up
with that one myself...

[raucous laughter]

Sorry. Don't kids have fun
getting messy?

Wait.
Was this part of the test?

Yes, it was.

And you passed!


Enjoy the Big World!

Thank you so much!

[Wage] I didn't think we'd ever make it.
[Lucky Bat] I am wise.

Are you guys ready? What?

This, students,
is what happens to dolls who get messy.


They get put through the wash!
[crowd gasps]

Every time you go through the washer,
you come out a little less perfect.

And if you keep getting
less and less perfect,

one day even the washer
won't save you

and your child's parents
will throw you away.

[buzzer]
[UglyDolls grunt]

I just don't want to see
any of you get rejected.

So if you want to pass
these tests, avoid mess.

Stay out of the wash.

You guys, he's right.
We've got to focus.

From this point forward,
we do it Lou's way.

<i>â™ª What I want, you've got â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And it might be hard
To handle â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But like the flame
That burns a candle â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The candle Feeds the flame â™ª</i>
[horn blares]

[gasps]
<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª What I got's full stock â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Of thoughts and dreams
That scatter â™ª</i>

[horn blares]
Whoa! Whoa!

<i>â™ª You can pull them
All together â™ª</i>

[all sighing, groaning]

<i>â™ª And how, I can't explain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, yeah, well, well, you â™ª</i>

[screams]
[sighs]

<i>â™ª Uh-huh
You make my dreams come true â™ª</i>

[grunting]
<i>â™ª Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Well, well, well, you â™ª</i>

[panting, grunting]
[horn blaring]

<i>â™ª You make my dreams
Come true â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Oh-oh-oh, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Baby â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoo-hoo â™ª</i>
[horn blares]

<i>â™ª I'm down on my daydream â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, that sleepwalk
Should be over by now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know â™ª</i>
[backup singers vocalizing]

<i>â™ª Oh, you â™ª</i>

Hyah! Hah!
<i>â™ª Yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You make my dreams
Come true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, I been waitin' for â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Waitin' for you, girl â™ª</i>
Oh!

<i>â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You make my dreams
Come true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh-oh-ohh, whoo â™ª</i>

[panting, gasping]

[Lou] My, my. I'm impressed.
[Moxy] Thanks.

And yet...

Never mind.

What?

Far be it from me
to discourage you.

Yeah, no.
That's really hard to do.

Of course it is.

But just between us,

no matter how agile
or unshakable you may be,

when you look up there
at that perfectly pretty doll

and all the joy
she comes with,

do you honestly think

your little band of sock
puppets stands a chance here?

[Babo wheezes]

Okay. [chuckles]

Carry on tryin',
but like I always say...

pretty makes perfect.

Good luck
at the Gauntlet tomorrow.


If pretty is what he wants,
we can do pretty.

Moxy,
what are you talking about?

Kidnapping should be a crime.

I'm pretty sure it is a crime.

Good points on both sides.

Maybe we should stop the
kidnapping until we settle this.

No way. He's expecting us.

And I want him to see my
bangs. They're side-swept now.

about your bangs!

are being haters lately.

[Ox grunts]


Where am I?
Who's in charge here?

Huh?

Hello, old friend.

L-Lou?

They know each other?

He just said, "L-Lou?"
Keep up.

Lou,
have you seen my bangs?

I think it's an improvement.

[nervous laughter]

Hi! Ready for tomorrow?


We... We thought
we'd give pretty a try.

If I'm being honest,

I think you all
kinda look great

just the way you are.

Well, before all of this.

Look,
if you're gonna do this,

can I do it for you
at least?

<i>â™ª First
We'll pluck a little here â™ª</i>

Ow!

<i>â™ª Then we'll tuck
A little there â™ª</i>

Hey!
[laughs]

<i>â™ª Then we'll cut
A little loose â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And apply a little mousse â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To what seems
To be your hair â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then we'll do A little tweeze â™ª</i>
Ow!

<i>â™ª Then we'll do A little more â™ª</i>
Oh.

<i>â™ª Then we'll wax
And then we'll bleach â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Till you're smoother
Than a peach â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Or at least
A little smoother â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Than you were before â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To me, you look okay â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª But if you truly
Want me to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll sculpt and mold â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And change
And fix you anyway â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey
We're gettin' all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Going with the flow
And looking so appealing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey, 'cause when
You're all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No one has to know Just
how flawed You're feelin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And if you can hide
What's shining through â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They'll see
A whole new you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So we'll try a little mask â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It'll open up your pores â™ª</i>
What's a pore?

<i>â™ª Then we'll rub
Some lotion in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And we'll soften up
Your skin â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So it doesn't look
Like yours â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then we'll moisten up
Your lips â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Buff your toenails to a T â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And we'll powder up
Your nose â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Or in your case, I suppose â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We'll just put
A little powder â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Where your nose should be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey
We're getting all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Blendin' with the crowd
Like we know we've got to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey, 'cause when
You're all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's when you're allowed
To pretend you're not you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And once you conceal
What's real and true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You'll see a whole new you â™ª</i>

Everyone, choose your weapons!

<i>â™ª Step one, find
The trendiest of outfits â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Step two, pick
The one that just about fits â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Step three
This is absolutely key â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Choose it not for you
But for who you wanna be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And then once you know
Which look you're into â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Say when and I guess
We can begin to squeeze â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And stretch â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And stuff and squish â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Until we nail
The whole display â™ª</i>

[song pauses]

[crickets chirping]

[song resumes]

Hey!
<i>â™ª Hey â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We're getting all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Feelin' fresh and free â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And lookin' oh-so-juicy â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey, 'cause when
You're all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª People only see
What you want them to see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And once who you are
Is hidden from view â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You'll be a whole new you â™ª</i>

Check us out!

<i>â™ª You'll be a whole new you â™ª</i>

We are ugly-licious!

<i>â™ª You'll be a whole new you â™ª</i>

Wow. Thank you, Mandy.

[Ugly Dog] Come on, dolly!
[Lucky] We're gonna beat that Gauntlet!

but I like it!


<i>â™ª Yeah
We're getting all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gosh, though, how I wish
That I didn't need to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sure
Look at me all dolled up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Stuck playing a part
Someone else agreed to â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ooh, if I could choose
Who I could be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd choose a whole new me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd choose a whole new me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'd choose a whole new â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Me â™ª</i>

Ugh!
What?

Whoa!

[disapproving chatter]

[gasps]
[sighs]

Ugh!
Ooh!

What is it?

O...
M...

Gosh.

No way!

[nervous laughter]

What is this?

Look at my bangs.

[gasps]
Face it, doll.

They look better on him.

We're Pretty Dolls now.

Well, you certainly are.

So you're happy for us?
So happy.

Why does he always
have to say it in that tone?

And yet so sad.
There he goes again.

You see, I'm afraid all your
hard work has been for nothing.

What do you mean?

No amount of makeup

or fancy new clothes
or dollscaping...

Excuse you?

...can take away the fact
that deep down,

you are UglyDolls.

There's no changing that.

UglyDolls can never
pass the Gauntlet.

We don't believe you.

You don't believe me?

I suspected as much.

But maybe you'll believe him.

[UglyDolls gasp]
[Tuesday gasps]

Hello? We kidnapped him.

Oh, yeah.

Ox? I... I don't understand.

Moxy.
Ox. Wait.

You won't believe this.
The Big World is real!

I know.

What?

Come on, Ox. Relieve the poor
creatures of their confusion.

Why don't you start
at the beginning.

What's he talking about?

Moxy, all I wanted to do was
protect you. But Lou's right.

You're never gonna get
to the Big World.

<i>Let me try to explain.</i>

<i>It all began
in the Doll Factory.</i>

<i>I don't know how,
but I ended up here at the Institute.</i>

<i>Lou welcomed me
and we became close friends.</i>

<i>And after I begged and begged,
he even let me train.</i>

<i>I even felt like I might
have a shot at the Big World.</i>

<i>I was messing it up for the others,
and they started to turn on me.</i>

<i>I was scared.</i>

<i>It was only Lou who saved me
by showing me a way out.</i>

<i>I wandered into the dark,</i>

<i>and that's when I discovered</i>

<i>the ugly truth
about who we are</i>

<i>and where we came from.</i>

<i>We UglyDolls
are nothing but rubbish.</i>

<i>The humans found us unlovable
and threw us away.</i>

<i>I blocked the way
to Recycling</i>

<i>so that outcast dolls
would be diverted to our cove.</i>

We are rejects.

[UglyDolls gasp]
No!


where reject dolls
can live safe

and free
of anyone else's judgment.


Oh, Moxy, look at you.

This is what I've been trying
to protect you from.

But I realized you'd need to
hear it from your oldest friend.

You don't belong
in the Big World.

You don't belong anywhere.

You shouldn't even exist.

Moxy,
I'm so sorry I lied.

So there's
no Big World for us?

No kid waiting?

I'm so sorry, everyone.

This is all my fault.
I should never...


Moxy, wait! Wait!

Now, Ox, I'm an amazingly magnanimous
guy, so I'll tell you what:

Go back to Uglyville.

Live your little ugly lives.
Never come back here.

And if you do,
it's Recycling for everyone.

I bet they'll be back.
That little pink one never gives up.

Yes, well, neither do I.

Extra! Extra! People of
Uglyville are revealed to be...

"Rejects"?

Who'd have thunk?

We heard it straight
from Ox's mouth.

Yep, it's time to wake up
and smell the ugly.

Just the bag, please.


Whee!

I've arrived!
I can't wait to learn

about this magical place
and all my...

Oh. [whimpers]

[Ugly Dog] I wish I could say
it wasn't so.

Things will never be
the same around here.

Brother,
can you spare a button?

[button clinking]
Hard times.

Hard, hard times.






Ugh!


Hey, yo. Wake up.

Or don't. It doesn't matter.

I wish I was sleeping. I don't know
why I'm up all early in the morning.

I can't do this anymore.

Did that make you feel better?

Mandy?
What are you doing here?

Moxy, you have to go back
and complete the Gauntlet.

[sighs] There's no point.
That's where you're wrong.

All your life you knew the truth
and you never stopped believing.

And you were right!

I never would have had
the courage to come here

if it weren't for you.


If you give up now
because you're not perfect,

what hope
do the rest of us have?

With five eyes or wedged heads
or glasses?

You need to fight, Moxy.

Show them it's our differences
that make us shine.

[pop music playing]

<i>â™ª There's always Gonna be

Great song, guys!
[Moxy gasps]

Oh, hello, Mandy.
Lou's gonna love this.

[Moxy] Whoa!
[Mandy] Hey!

We are getting so good
at kidnapping, right?

you beautiful monsters!

[gasps]
[Moxy] Whoa!

Lou? What you doing here?

You didn't think I was gonna
miss all the fun, did you?

You did miss the whole climbing
down, kidnapping, dragging,

climbing back up,
being tired part.

I see you brought Mandy, too.
How delightful.

But you told us to bring Moxy
back to you and...

I came up
with a far better plan.

What are you doing? You've
already crushed their spirits.

Sure,
Uglyville may be crushed,

but we both know
Moxy will never give up.

Without you around,
the rest of them will stay away forever.

The only reason I let you
stay in Perfection

was to keep up appearances.

Everybody says, "Oh, Lou,

you're so nice!
You're the best!"

Do you know how long I've
worked for that adulation?

Those Pretty Dolls,
they're mine.

They hang on my every word.

And if you think
I'm gonna let you

take that away from me,

you're as empty-headed
as the rest of them.

[gasps]
You're both ugly.

And ugly things
belong in Recycling.

No!
You can't do this!

system, but I'll fix it.

We'll see each other again soon.
You'll be brand-new.

[grunts]
[Mandy yells]

You'll be perfect!


[British accent] Please, sir.
Can I have some more?

Um... a little bit more.
Ugh.

Bless you, sir.
Perhaps even a little...

Get lost, Oliver.
It's tough times all over.

Where's Moxy?

Wouldn't you hide too

if you were responsible
for all of this?

Whoa!
It's not all her fault.

I mean, I just went along with
it without so much as a bark.

All I wanted to do was help her get
a look inside that magic flower.

It all started
with the tea leaves.

My tea leaves.

Oh, yeah. I never tried
to talk to her out of it.

I thought it was
a great idea all along.

into your little pity party.

Hmph!
[sighs]

It's all my fault! I've always
wished I could be as brave as Moxy.

But I've always been afraid
of my own shadow,

and I saw this as an opportunity
to step outside of my comfort zone.


It's got to get
better than this, right?

Oh, look at us.
We're falling to pieces.

and we're gonna make things right.

stronger than this soup.


Hello?


[clattering]
What?


Did you see anything?
[mechanical clanking, clicking]


Huh?

What? Oh, no.


Moxy, just give it up.
We've already tried.

[grunts, sighs]

[alarm buzzes, blaring]

Huh?

Uh...

[panting, grunting]

No. No! Oh, no! No!

Aah!

Moxy!
Ox!

[Wage] Let's go!
[Ugly Dog] We got you.

Ready, Wage? Now!

We can't hold this forever!

[all grunting, straining]

[Mandy] Hold on!
[Babo] Hold on tight!

Whoo!
[gasps]

Whoa!

[all grunting, straining]

No!

Babo!


Oh, no!

[Wage] Come on, Babo!
[Moxy] Stretch, Babo, stretch!


I'm not gonna make it!

Yeah!
Yes!

Okay, pull!
Pull!

Pull!
Pull!

Hyah, Willard!
Whoo-hoo!

Yes!


[machine powers down]

[Ox exhales]
[Ugly Dog] Whew.

I'm lucky you got that thing on your
head, whatever it is.


No, Gibberish Cat,
we're not just going home.

If Lou tried to recycle us,
then no one is safe.

Moxy's right. I lived my whole
life being afraid, but never again.

We need to take a stand.
All of us!

But how? We're rejects!
I read it in the paper.

We are not rejects.
Our flaws make us who we are.

You know what? We have enough flaws for
every doll in Perfection and then some.

I have three brains!

And me,
I'm shaped like a spork!

See this head? It's a wedge!

And I'm greedy with the soup!

Those are all
worth fighting for!

Well, maybe not being greedy
with the soup, but the others!

Now let our freak flags fly!


[female announcer]
<i>Attention, please.</i>

<i>All Gauntlet runners
must immediately report</i>

<i>to the starting area.</i>


Ahh!

Are you ready
for the Gauntlet?

[male doll] I'm ready!

<i>â™ª I said, "Are you ready?" â™ª</i>

Yes! Excuse me.
Sorry. Coming through.

Mandy. How unexpected.


[male UglyDoll]
Step aside, model/engineer.

Watch out.
Hey, watch the plush!

Coming through,
coming through.

Pegacorn coming through.

Hello, old friend.

Oh, this is rich.
This is really rich.

You can't possibly think
you'll pass.

Maybe we will. Maybe we won't.

But every doll in this stadium
is gonna see us try.

You know what, Lou?

When I first got here,

I thought you were perfect.

I couldn't find a single thing
wrong with you.

But I can see
a lot better now.

What!

Yes. Yes,
you'll run the Gauntlet.

And I'm gonna run it with you.
[crowd cheers]

[female doll] I wanna run
your Gauntlet, Lou!

Yeah! Activate the core.

Intimidating warm-up grunts.

You? Run the Gauntlet?

I don't even have to win.

I just need to make sure
you lose.

And when I'm done,
I'll have my loyal subjects

escort each and every
last UglyDoll to Recycling...

where you belonged
in the first place.


Now, as you all know,

the Gauntlet
is designed to simulate

real-world obstacles.

The participants must make it
through the doggy door

and cross the finish line
to win.

[male UglyDoll] Go, Moxy!


Yes!
[UglyDolls whoop, cheer]

[Ox] Yeehaw!
Tallyho, Moxy!


[Nolan grunts] Help me!

Whoa!
Whoa!

Lou, we have to save him!

Leave him! He's a lost cause.
He's gone forever.

I'm over here!

You could grab my hand!

There's nothing
we could've done.

Good doggy.

You call that a dog?


It's all right, guys.

Slick Dog's got this.

[upbeat music plays]

What are you doing?

Havin' fun, gettin' crazy,

gettin' loose!

Go! I'll stall him.
Go, go, go!

[whooping, cheering]


Huh? Go, team!
[Tuesday] Hey!

Lou! I totally don't
deserve this!

[muffled screaming]
Uh-oh.

I'm starting to think
Lou's just not that into me.


Time to clean up this mess.

Forever.
[Mandy gasps] Moxy!

[Lou laughs]

Go, Moxy! Keep going!
Come on!


[gasps]
[yelling]

Yeah!


Yeah!
Yay!

Let's go!

Yes!

[Lucky Bat]
Stairs. Stairs. Stairs!


[all yell]
[Baby gurgles]

do this, Baby. No!

[Baby babbles, gurgles]

Ox! Are you okay?

My head feel not good.

Oh!
[Lou] Whoa!


[Ugly Dog] Hey!

Is it okay for a pet

to have their own pet?

Yes!

Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

Unhand me, you annoying little hazard.
Let go now!

[crying]
[crowd gasps]

Did you see that?
Who kicks a baby?

Boo, Lou!

[blows raspberry]

[Baby whimpering]


[Lou yells, grunts]

[crowd cheers]

Moxy!
Come on, Moxy!




[whimpering continues]


[crying continues]

It's okay. Don't cry.

You'll be okay.



No.


Sorry we didn't pass.

[audience cheering]


You did it, Moxy.

Gauntlet bypassed!

Love and compassion
are the doll's true purpose.

Run celebration protocol.
Time to party!

For an Exposition Robot,
that guy is pretty cool.

[all cheering, whooping]
[audience cheering]



Well, I guess
the cat's out of the bag.

You failed?

How could you fail?

You still don't get it.

Of course I failed.
I'll always fail!

I'm a prototype!
What?

"Prototype" is, like,
a good thing, right?

No!
He ain't a real doll, girl.

You thought that
I stuck around this place

because I cared so much
about you mindless sycophants?

[gasps]
"Sycophants" is, like, a good thing, right?

Ugh! No, you imbecile!

Is "imbecile" a good thing?
My gut says, "Yeah."

I'm the model!
The mold!

Sent by the factory
to help guide you through.

Sounds amazing, right?

Uh...
Wrong!

Prototypes are not meant
for public consumption.

I was never allowed to go to
the Big World, but you could!

How could someone as ugly
as you be accepted and loved

while someone as perfect as I
never could and never will?

Let's see how you feel when you're trapped
in this place forever, just like me.

[gasps]
[grunts]

[yelling, groaning]

[Lou laughs]

Come on!


Dolls don't need you
or your training.

You did it all
just to feel powerful?

What happened to you?
We were like brothers.

You, a reject, were gonna leave
me, just like the others.

Ever wonder why the
Pretties turned on you?

It was you!
You tried to have me recycled!

You wanted to leave so bad,

I sent you right
where you belong.



The only thing I did wrong

was I should have waited

to make sure
you were recycled.

Whoa! [grunting]

I need a boost!

I got nothing.

[Lou laughs]

Lou, no! Don't do this!

Ready!
Fire!

Destiny time!

[grunts]
Huh?

[groaning, yelling]

[Lou yelling]
[crowd cheering]

No! No! No!

[UglyDolls laugh]

Good dog.
Girls! Girls!

Are you gonna let them
take over?

After everything
I've done for you?

So where do you want him,
boss?

Hmm. I haven't decided.
Any suggestions?

[doll 1]
Tear the stuffing out of him!

[doll 2] Shred that liar, honey!
[doll 3] Let the dog have him!

[doll 4] Give him back to the baby!
No, please!

I know I'm not perfect,
but I deserve a second chance.

Look into your heart.
Look into your heart!

Um, I have an idea.

[crowd cheering]
[Lou] No!

Do you know how expensive
this suit is? Dry-clean only!

Hey, guys? Something's
not right with the portal.


<i>â™ª There's a child
For every doll â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I guess
That's not quite true â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There won't be one
For me now â™ª</i>

Or for you.

Or you.

Or you.

<i>â™ª I can't believe it's over â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And Lou will get his way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Even dreamers
Have to wake up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Guess today will be the â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Show 'em who you are â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Show 'em
That you're strong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Show 'em that you know
Where you belong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Open every door â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Own your destiny â™ª</i>

Deep in your heart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And believe in the you
That you see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Then become what you are â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And you'll set yourself â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Free â™ª</i>

So, what happened next?

Well, you're not
gonna believe it.

Or maybe you will.
I don't even know you!

As your mayor,
I'm proud to announce

the permanent merger
of Uglyville and Perfection.

<i>â™ª So amazing, and yet
It gets even much better â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's one thing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª There's one thing
That's better â™ª</i>

Well, Moxy, you did it.
Today's the day.

Not for one minute.

Well, okay, maybe one minute.
Or, like, I don't know, five to ten.

The time here is so funky.
I mean, how long did this take us?

What is this, a day? A month?
What, 83 minutes?

It's all very confusing.

But look, Moxy,

you better come back
to visit, you hear me?

Of course I'm coming back.

You know Uglyville
will always be my home.

You were right the whole time,
Lucky Bat.


We found our own truth.

[man] Shh! Don't wake her up.
[woman] She's gonna be so excited.
