[tense music]
[fire crackling]

[sirens ringing]

[vehicle roaring]

[Police Officer]
Copy, we have a visual.

This guy is flying, the
MW Unit Six in sight.

[Police Officer]
Where's my roadblock?

[door slamming]

[vehicle roaring]

[Police Officer] He's
not fucking stopping.

[Police Officer] If you
have to apprehend suspect.

[brakes skidding]

[upbeat music]

[Police Officer] Driver, take
the keys out of the ignition

and put both of your hands
out the driver's side window.

Slowly exit the vehicle.

[door rattling]

Drop the weapon!
Okay, I'm putting it down,

don't shoot me.
[gun thumping]

[Police Officer] Clear,
clear, anyone else in the car?

Just me.

[Officer Schiano]
What's in your trunk?

Don't let it out!
Don't fucking move.

Oh shit, there's
someone back there.

know what you've done.

[Police Officer] Shut up.

Did you hear that?
[Officer Pope] Hear what?

She said something.

[Officer Pope] I've been
standing here the whole time,

I haven't heard anything.
Get her away from me.

[Officer Pope] Hey man,
take it easy, what's wrong?

[Detective Schiano]
Please God, no!

[Officer Pope screaming]

[gun shooting]
[police officers]

[eerie music]

[gun shooting]
[Officer Schiano thumping]

[siren ringing]
[suspenseful music]

[door slamming]

[woman singing]

[doors slamming]

Ambulance Six.

I'm here at the scene, all
these people were left behind.

[Police Officer] 10
four, help is on the way.

[door rattling]
[tense music]

Why in God's name did you
kill those four officers?

I already told
you it wasn't me.

The only thing
I can't figure out

is how you managed
to pull it off.

Your vehicles have cameras,
take a look at the footage.

Your officer did it.

Why would he do that?

It's the woman, she's
not what you think.

You mean the one you
locked in the trunk?

[tense music]

What were you gonna do to her?

[phone clicking]
[message whooping]

[feet thumping]

[bag thumping]

So, what's in the bag?

The beginning of the end.

[bag rustling]
[zip zipping]

[flash drives thumping]

That's it?

What are these for?
You'd never believe me.

I wouldn't have.

Try me.
I've said enough.

[suspenseful music]

[door rattling]

I want everything you can
find out that guy, ASAP.

I'm on it.
[feet thumping]

Die Apokalypse naht.

[door rattling]

Do you wanna say anything
else before we proceed?

Rette uns alle.

Have it your way.

[keyboard clicking]

[birds chirping]

story with this place?

Built in the late 1800s,
sits on 360 acres of land.

There's over 100 buildings
on this property.

It was designed to be
a self-contained town.

That's pretty cool.

It was a state run
psychiatric hospital.

They closed the doors
nearly 30 years ago.

Like asylums all
around the country,

invasive techniques like
prefrontal lobotomies

and electric shock therapy,

they performed it here.

People were
abused on this land.

Then why do you wanna shoot
at this location then?

I've shot here
many times before.

It always makes for a
very interesting backdrop.

I agree.

Anything to worry about?
Besides the caving ceilings

and probably peeling lead paint,

I don't see how it
could really hurt us.

Are you sure that
it's a good idea then?

Billy, I think we're gonna get

some really great stuff here.

As long as we would
watch our step inside,

there should be no problems.

My friend told me that
this place is haunted.

Supposedly some urban
explorers reported activity

of some devil worshipers.

But what abandoned place hasn't?

And like I said on the phone,

I'm paying double
my normal rate.

My agent says I need more
location shots in my portfolio.

And plus, I've been fascinated
by places like this.

Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

Cool, listen, bats, rats,
and all sorts of insects

probably call this place home,

but none of them are
gonna pose a threat to us.

And the area that we're
going to is so remote

that no one's gonna bother us.

Hey, how are we
going to be here?

A couple of hours.

It wouldn't be a good idea
to be here after dark.

Oh, why not?

There's no light.

And it would be very
dangerous getting around

when the sun goes down.

[tense music]
[grass rustling]

Is everything okay?

Yeah, I think so.

[flies buzzing]
[feet thumping]

Hey, hold on.

Mask, flashlight, come on.

[feet thumping]

[dramatic music]

[tense music]

[feet thumping]

Watch your head.
[eerie music]

You don't need your
mask yet, come on.

[floor boards rattling]

[Steve coughing]

[stone thumping]
[Billy screaming]

I guess we're not the
only ones here today.

Does that concern you?

No, this place gets
all sorts of visitors.

Let's go.

[feet thumping]

Well, let's shoot in
here, I love to light.

Okay, so where would
you want me to be?

[plastic rustling]
First, take that.

Put your stuff down on
it and go over there,

let's shoot over there.
Of course.

All right.

Are you excited?
Oh, yeah [laughs].

[bag thumping]
Good, yeah,

it's gonna be awesome.

[upbeat music]
[plastic rustling]

[zip zipping]

[camera snapping]

Let's switch rooms.

How about a different outfit?

Okay, I have a
pretty white dress.

It's right behind
you, please bring it.

[feet thumping]
[phone beeping]

[message whooshing]
[dress rustling]

[feet thumping]

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Please help me out
of this, the bottom.

[zip zipping]

Thank you.
Good, okay.

[dress rustling]

[tense music]
[phone clicking]

[message whooshing]

Steve, turn around.
What's wrong?

I just saw someone.
Who?

I don't know, someone
dressed in dark clothes.

[feet thumping]

I don't see anybody.

around that corner.

[feet thumping]
Steve, be careful.


[eerie music]

Steve?

[feet thumping]

Are you okay?

Steve?
[feet thumping]

[Steve grunting]
Oh my God.

Get out of here,
run, run [gurgles]!

[pepper spray spritzing]
[devil worshiper screaming]

[Billy screaming]

[Devil Worshiper]
Get off me [grunts].

[Billy sobbing]

[man screaming]

[feet thumping]

[eerie music]
[fire crackling]

[devil worshiper speaks
in foreign language]

[devil worshiper laughing]

[suspenseful music]

what's your emergency?

My name is Billy, Billie
Winters, we need help.

We are at the old psychiatric
hospital off North Zero.


There are people here
who killed my friend.

And they're now
trying to attack me.

[twigs snapping]
[Operator] I need you

to please remain calm.
[tense music]

Can you please tell me
what building you're in?

[suspenseful music]
Hello?

Are you still there, Ma'am?

Ma'am, hello?

Okay, we're dispatching
officers to the scene.

Please, try and find
a safe place to hide.

no, get away [screams].

[tense music]
[laptop beeping]

That was quite a show.

I'm a little
disappointed though.

I was expecting more than
just a pirated B-movie.

It's real.
[hand thumping]

It looks like it's
gonna be a long night.

[sirens ringing]

[engine stuttering]

What's wrong?
The engine just died.

We've gotta get this
woman to the hospital.

Now the radio's not working.

How far are we from
any kind of help?

Probably a good 10 miles.
We can't just sit here

and let her die, I'm
calling for help.

[door rattling]

You feel it, don't you?

Yeah, you're
giving me a headache.

Trust me, you don't
wanna watch those.

Give me a break.
[tense music]

[keyboard rattling]

By "The Seraphinian
Necronomicon",

I say these words so
that you will rise again.

I say these words so that,
Satan, you will live through me.

[Mike And Gerry] Don't
say these words, Ritchie!

[eerie music]

[Gerry] What the fuck?
[grunts] Say you love Satan.

[upbeat music]

officials point to new evidence

of the drug related
murder of a teenage boy

who allegedly was a
member of a satanic cult.

His eyes were removed
in what police described

as a ritualistic killing.

Hello again, this
is Mike Campbell

with the Nightmares
and Dreams Video Blog,

the blog dedicated to
the search for truth

within the realms of the
paranormal, supernatural

and the unexplained phenomenon.

[eerie music]

Today, I will tell you
about the true story

I actually forgot even happened.

It's been the cause of my
nightmares for the past 30 years.

It's laid buried deep
within my psyche.

But I have an obligation to
tell the world the truth,

because it came back.

I found the book, the book
I thought we destroyed,

the book that summonses
the Devil himself.

[feet thumping]
[hoover droning]

Mom, what are you doing?

I'm filming my blog here!

I'm vacuuming, I'm
vacuuming, I'm sorry.

[monitor clicking]

I'm totally serious
folks, I really found it,

"The Book of the Dead", "The
Seraphinian Necronomicon".

Never utter these words lest
ye summon the Devil himself.

I have all the footage,
everything, I'm gonna play it now.

If you're faint of heart,
please turn this off.

The police don't even
have this footage.

And this is what really happened
in the woods back in 1984.

And that camera was
never found until now.

To tell you the truth, I
don't even know how I have it.

I just woke up and right
next to my bed was this book.

And then, all the memories
came flooding back to me.

It was, I had somehow
forgotten them,

but now I know why I am who I
am, why I studied the occult,

why I have these dreams,

why I can't sleep for more
than three hours a night,

and why I feel like I'm being
pulled into another dimension.

He's been trying to come back.

Satan's been whispering in
my ear for the past 30 years.

if you dare watch the story,

the murders in Aztakea woods

in Northport, 1984, Long Island.

This is completely unedited.

I don't know why I'm
fucking showing this.

[feet thumping]
[birds chirping]


Going into the woods but, and.

know where it was.

no idea where it is.


[feet thumping]

All right, this is real good.

Of course she is, you
have to go and stop it.

It's gonna be awful.
You better come with me.

wanna be in my movie?

Ew.
Ew, no.

[Mrs. Rose] Michael Campbell,
please do not film people

without their permission!

Mike, where the fuck
did you get that camera?

Rose's art project.

It's supposed to be room loops

or just like video of your room.

But my mom won't let
me shoot our house.

Why not?

something about the bunch

of recent robbery,
she's totally paranoid.

[Ritchie singing]
Right, this fucking kid,

please don't mention anything
else about Black Sabbath.

Come on, man,
you know Sabbath.

Please try for
the rest of the day,

just try not to
mention one thing...

Sabbath rules, man,
you know no guitars

is heavier than Tony Iommi.
[Mike] Except Buck Dharma.

And don't forget
Eddie van Halen.

[boys singing]

what's this like fucking

like tree house like fucking
birdhouse doing in the woods?


Ritch, it's about the size

of your girlfriend's cunt.

'cause my cock is so huge.

[Jimmy screaming]
[Mike] Shit, shit.

of fucking pussies.

Neat camera, where'd
you steal it from?

you better not fuck with it.

It's Mrs. Rose, so you better
not fuck with it [laughs].

Who give a f...

Actually, Mrs. Rose
is pretty cool.

So, what are you
guys, like a gang?

No, we're a cult, The
Knights of the Black Circle.


We're fucking Satanists, man.

And if you tell anyone,
we'll fucking kill you.

Don't tell anyone,

doesn't Einstein realize
we're filming this shit?

Hey, you guys
wanna see something?

You wanna see the
power of Satan?

see the power of Satan.

[tense music]
But first.

[lighter clicking]


You gonna share that?

[Gerry] Maybe.
Give me that shit, fuck it.

[Gerry] I guess we are.
You fucking idiot.

[Gerry] I'm sorry.
The fuck's wrong with you?

A lot of things, I guess.

Where did you get
that jacket, Dafans?

a jokester, huh?

The fuck you think's funny?

Dafans, the jacket.

nothing around, dude.

gonna inhale that weed

or are you just gonna waste it?

You guys think you guys
are real jokesters, huh?

You wanna see something funny?

Fucking follow me, this way.

[leaves rustling]

[tense music]

to close to that, man.

You can summon Satan
with that shit.

You think that's funny, queer?


You have to sacrifice...


guys doing with that cat?

better not hurt it.

Whoa, whoa, all
right, relax, okay?

It's my sister's cat, I just
gotta watch it for the weekend.

if we tape everyone, do you?

Go right ahead,
what do I care?

We'll be on the other
side soon, anyways.

The fourth dimension, man.

this kid's been at it.

No, no, no, I heard
Aleister Crowley used to talk

about the fourth dimension,
Satan rules over it [laughs].

Mr. Crowley.
[Mike] Mr. Crowley!

You've been reading too many...
No, no, no, no.

Your friend here
nailed it, okay?

[eerie music]
The Thelmians knew about it.

That's the religion
Crowley started,

but it goes back
farther, though,

to like the ancient
Egyptians and shit.

Then Anton LaVey came
along, he knew about majik.

That's M-A-J-I-K,
it's conjuring.

You can talk to Satan,
and he's alive and well.

It's in the fucking
Bible, all right?

He's supposed to be
free after 1,000 years.

how do you summon Satan?

feel so good, tell him.

Well, I've been researching,

and there's all kinds of
rituals you have to follow,

but until I find a book
with a certain chant,

I can't do it, and I've tried
a million different ways.

Wait, what book?

'Cause my uncle owns a
bookstore up in Main.

He specializes in those weird
like hard to find books.

He could get any book on loan.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, his
books are always mint, man.

Needless Things, right?

Uh.

The book's been translated
into different languages.

But the text, now the
text is in a language

that no one can decipher.

So, most experts
think it's bullshit.

It has some kickass
drawings in it, though.

I've seen pictures in
another book about it.

People mangled with machinery,

animals with wheels implanted
into 'em, and crazy shit.

Supposedly, the guy who
wrote it was in a trance.

And he entered Satan's kingdom
in the fourth dimension

and he came back with the words,

with the words the allow
the Devil to come back here.

The book is called...
[Girl] Hits, hits!

Oh, shit, cops, go, go, go.

[Police Officer]
God damned kids!

[feet thumping]
[leaves rustling]

[Mike vomiting]

Mike, can we see any part
of your video project yet?

it right now.

[birds chirping]

What's up with you two,
you look fucked up?

We're on acid, Ritchie
got it from Jimmy.

[Mike] I'm so sure.
No, really [laughs].

We're tripping our faces
off, dude [laughs].

You look like a fucking
replica from "Blade Runner".

No, no, he looks
more like a scanner.

Run, his head's gonna
explode [laughs]!

Wait, I have a joke.

You are a joke, man.

Wait, no, no, listen, listen.

All right, so this guy
joins the Army, right?

And after the first week, he
realizes he's in this big...

What the fuck do you call 'em?

Barracks, all right,
he's in this big,

he's in this big barracks,

sharing a room with
like 100 other guys.

And he's really horny,

but he can't whack
off because, you know,

all the other guys are
around and stuff, you know?

So, he goes to the sergeant,

and he's like, "Sarge,
I got a problem.

"I'm really horny, but I got
nowhere to take care of it,

"if you know what I mean."

And the sergeant's like, "Yeah,
yeah, I know what you mean.

"I know exactly what
you're talking about.

"We got just the
thing for that."

So, he brings him around
the corner of the tent

to this big barrel with the
little hole in the side.

And he's like, "Go ahead,
stick your pecker in there."


Yeah, in the barrel.

So he puts his thing inside
the barrel and he's just like,

"Oh, God," [laughs]
he's like, "Holy shit.

"Oh my God, this is
fucking awesome."

And he's like, "Sarge,"
he says to him,

"you can use it
anytime you want.

"Except on Tuesdays."

So the guy's like, "Why,
what happens on Tuesdays?"

And so, the Sarge goes, "That's
your day inside the barrel."

[boys laughing]
You get it?

I didn't think so.

[aircraft droning]

That's good, that's
one of my better jokes.

Gerry told me he's gay.

What?

He tried touching me
right before you walked in.

No, I didn't.

Then, then why is your
penis so hard [laughs]?

You mother fucker!

[Ritchie and Gerry grunting]

you two, you're gonna kill him!

fucking kill you!

having a bad trip!

Get the fuck off of me,

fucking asshole.
Fucking pussy.

Get the fuck outta here.

Fucking piece of shit.

Eddie Van Halen is still
better than Tony Iommi.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment has arrived.

We will now be full members

of the Knights of
the Black Circle.

Fuck the Knights, what
do we need them for?

forgot my BOC tape.

You guys gotta hear this
song, "Take Me Away".

It's fucking heavy, it's about
aliens abducting this dude

that wants to be taken
away from his shit home.

Mike, could you
please shut the fuck up

so I could get this
damned thing open?

[Mike] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Gerry] I'm having

a hard time here.
Come on, come on.

[plastic rustling]

There we go.
[Ritchie] Pfft,

what the fuck is that?

Wait, there's more.
[plastic rustling]

Yes, oh, I want more
bubble wrap, me too.

Oh, I forgot to
tell you guys this.

This weed was dusted.
[Mike] What's dusted?

[eerie music]

[Ritchie laughing]
This book is fucking creepy.

so I can film it better.

[girl singing]
Holy shit, man.

What the fuck was that?
[Ritchie] I don't know.


Let's see if you
could do any better.

You suck, watch.
[Ritchie] Yeah, I have one.

[belches] Fuck.
[Ritchie] [laughs]

You suck worse than me.

Shut the fuck up.
[Mike] Yeah, we all suck

at burping, you
guys, let's see that.

Necronomicon".

[tense music]
[Ritchie laughing]

[Gerry choking]
[Ritchie] You okay, Ger?

Geez man, what the hell?

[Gerry vomiting]
Fuck, dude.

Did he eat something?

don't know what to do.

[Gerry spitting]

Gerry, say something,

man, are you all right?
[Gerry gasping]



[upbeat music]

Buck Dharma totally
smells Eddie Van Halen.

[Mike's Mother knocking]
[Mike's Mother] Sweetheart,

you're gonna be late for school.

Just a second!

All right, Mike, this
is Wendy and Susan.

[birds chirping]
They're sisters.


Ah, warm PBRs are
better than no PBRs.

Mike, take it slow.

You don't wanna P-U-K-E.
You're not like six.

We can spell you, you idiot.
[Susan laughing]

[Wendy spitting]
[Ritchie laughing]

[Ritchie and Susan kissing]

[Ritchie laughing]
What's with the camera?

Mrs. Rose class.

I'm doing it as a video project.

Can we be in it,
please, please, please?

[Wendy And Susan]
Please, please, please,

please, please, please,
please, please, please, please?

[Susan and Wendy giggling]

Okay, you can be in, I
think you got the part.

Hey, so I read three
lines from that book.


Yesterday, the picture
had a girl giving herself

to a guy, or maybe it was
a werewolf, I don't know.

Anyways, I read the chant,
and next thing you know,

I'm at the gazebo
with the two sisters,

and the rest is history.

chicks are freaky.

Did you see them totally
making out, that shit was hot?

Yeah, it's a Satanic miracle.

The guy who can't
even score one girl

gets not one but
two lovely ladies

and manages to bring
them out to the woods?

[tense music]

There's nothing holy about it.

[Ritchie and Mike laughing]

Yeah, I'm sure
it was a werewolf.

You guys are fucking dicks.
[leaves rustling]

the fuck is Ritchie?

I don't know, I haven't
seen him in so long.

I think he got
kicked outta school.

He cut out so many
frigging times.

And then he showed
up to Nadler's class,

tripping his fucking face off.

[birds chirping]

No wonder he got kicked out.
Yeah.


but his mom said he
wasn't available.

What does, "Wasn't
available," mean anyway?

I have no idea.

Look, he probably...


Spit it out, Gilligan.

I don't know, remember it
was his turn with the book?


Well, he said that he
figured out the text.

He said he could
actually understand all

that fucking gibberish,
said an angel came

to him in a dream
and touched him.

it was that angel

from that CZ Top video,
I wish she'd touch me.

No, it was a black angel, he
said, from Satan's universe,

or hell, or whatever
the fuck he read.

I have no clue, but
she had black wings,

and she was touching
his forehead and shit.

I don't know.

Okay, how about this?

He wakes up in the morning

and the book is on
his fucking chest.

Meanwhile, the night before
he, hides it in his closet

so his old man wouldn't find it.

How does a book that he hid
in his closet the night before

end up on his chest
the next morning?

I mean, tell me that
is not unbelievable.

believe that shit?

Ritch has been doing like a hit

of acid every day for a month.

He's nuts, that's all.

I don't know.

The last time that I spoke
to him, he sounded weird.

And it wasn't drugs.

Like, he just sounded weird.

Like I think he's obsessed.
[Ritchie screaming]

[Ritchie laughing]

Oh my God, Ritchie.
How's school, losers?

the fuck you been?

You look like shit,
did you lose 10 pounds?

Yeah, and where's my book?

Your book, your book?

Yeah, my book.
[Ritchie] It's all

of mankind's book, man, and
it's opening up a portal

to the fourth dimension.
[Mike] Yup, he's lost it.

Exactly.
I'm not joking, man.

This shit, it works.

Every time I do an incantation,
I feel this powers.

It's better than any drug
I've ever done before.

And I can hear him.
[Gerry] Oh my God.

I hear the whispers.

drugs have you done?

losing it, are you okay?

I'm fine, man.
[Mike] Hey, fuck off me.

Are you nuts?
Hey, I'll show you.

[leaves rustling]

I'm right here.

fuck down from there.

the fuck you doing?

Get down, you're gonna fall.


[Gerry] What the fuck?
[Mike] What the fuck did?

the fuck did, okay,

where the fuck did he go?

[Mike yelling]


fucking impossible.


So, I've been
studying the book,

and there were all these
different incantations.

So, like warmups for the
final materialization.

And once the door is
breached, he enters,

and it's only happened like
12 other times in history

when he's come over.

But he could never
hold on to his power

and he had to go back.

He was thinking too
big and too broadly,

getting into politics
and world affairs.

But now he knows
he's gotta sneak in

by tearing a small
rip in the curtain,

building an army of darkness.

why we haven't seen you

in over a month?

No, I got an Atari,
"Space Invaders".

It's unbelievable, man.


Well, in order
to get some power,

you have to sacrifice something.

That little trick I did
earlier used everything up,

but I just had to show you guys.

Look over there.

What the fuck is that?

Holy shit, it's Jimmy's
sister's fucking cat.

still bloody, oh God.

the fucking head?


So, I wanna warn the
faithful followers

of the Nightmares
and Dreams Video Blog

that what you're about to
see is the unedited truth.

It's not for the faint
of heart or from minors.

Hopefully you didn't hack
into your daddy's PC.

[eerie music]

You may not believe your eyes

of what you're about to witness.

It's none other than Satan
himself being summoned.

[eerie music]

I made you chocolate chip
cookies, your favorite.

[cookie thumping]
[monitor clicking]

Mike, why did you bring
me out here in the woods?

And what are you always
filming everything for?

for Mrs. Rose's art class.

It's supposed to be room
loops, not woods loops.

Whatever, that's like the
stupidest thing I've ever heard.

Just hold this while
I read this chant.

[speaks in foreign language]
[eerie music]

[Susan screaming]
[flesh tearing]

Fuck, Susan, where did you go?

Susan, Susan, Susan,
where are you, Susan?

[liquid trickling]
[rain splattering]

What the fuck?

What the fuck, where
the fuck did she go?

She's fucking gone,
she's fucking dead.

Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit, Susan!

[eerie music]

What the fuck, holy shit, Susan!

What the fuck, it it
wasn't raining a second ago.

guys gotta see the footage,

she's fucking dead!

Why the fuck you
still filming then?

We have to destroy it.

didn't do anything.

You guys, I think this
fucking hole ate her.

Yo, fuck you, I'm with Mike,
we film everything from now on.

We have to have proof that
this shit fucking happened.

What, like the fucking
Devil is just gonna step out

for an interview if we say
another spell from the book?

Let me see that you [speaks
in foreign language].

[blood splattering]
What the fuck?

[Gerry] Holy shit.
What the fuck just happened?

[Ritchie and Gerry grunting]
[Mike] Doolb, doolb, Natas,

it's Satan, don't you guys
see, it's blood, it's backward?

They're just words, but
everything is backwards.

Doolb is blood, Natas is Satan.

You just asked Satan to bathe
you in doolb, I mean, blood.

[wings fluttering]
What, that fucking thing

just almost hit me in the head.

Fuck, let's go.

Go, go, go!

the fuck out of here!

[feet thumping]

What the fuck?

You realize we should have run

into Church Street
by now, right?

No, we should have run
into the harbor by now.

Where the fuck are we?

The fucking hole, how
the did we get back here?

page the book is open to!

Fuck no, why doesn't
Satan's lover over here do it?

Don't call me that?
Shut the fuck up, Ritchie!

You're the one who got us
into all this crazy shit.

What the fuck has it shown?


[eerie music]

It says, "Final incantation

"for materialization
of the Dark Lord.

"Ye who read these words now sit

"at the side of the Desolate One

"who shall reclaim
dominion over this world

"and all other
dimensions within."

Holy shit, the hole's bleeding.

move, I wanna read this.

Don't say these words.

Oh, Ritchie, don't say
these words, Ritchie!

Ritchie, don't say these
words, come on, Ritchie!

Don't say these word.
Hey, honey!

Don't say these words,
don't say these words!

Say you love Satan!
[Ritchie grunting]

[blood splattering]
[Mike's Mother laughing]

Hey, what's up, eh?

You doing all right?
Yeah, I am.

this, I am innocent,

and I have to tell you and
you, I did not do this.

I don't know why
nobody will believe me,

but I am so outta here.
[Police Officer] Hey, hey!

What the hell is up with this?

[Police Officer] Where
you going, come on,

what are you doing?

Let's go.
I'm trying to tell you.

No one will believe em.
How did she get in here,

anyway, in the first place?
[Woman] What, isn't that

that rock star?
Hey, you need to shut up

and come with me,
move it, let's go.

What was that?

That show was some crazy shit.

Yeah, what do you think?

Maybe those kids at Long
Island that disappeared?

Christ, do you think
there's a connection?

That's all we need.

Yeah, I hate the weird ones.

Speaking of which, I
wanna show you something.

[envelope rustling]
[eerie music]

What the hell is this?

It's totally unrelatable,
but this whole thing

with Schneider has
got me thinking,

this happened when I was
in L.A. about 10 years ago.

A cable repair guy murdered
three residential customers

before being gunned down.

It's horrible.

A cable repair guy?
Yeah.

He claimed the Devil live
inside his cable box.

Wonderful, now I've
officially heard everything.


We've gotta her
her temperature down.

[blanket rustling]

Dr. Goode.
[eerie music]

[Dr. Goode grunting]

[Detective Semler coughing]

I'll be back.
[eerie music]

You've been infected.

allergies, all right?

It's a real bitch.

What about your partner?
You know what?

Maybe you ought to worry
about yourself for now.

There's not a blemish
on this guy's record.

I mean, he's never even
had a speeding ticket.

Well, maybe he snapped, I
mean, we've seen that before.

He's supposed to be some kind
of hot shot computer expert.

His specialty's creating
antivirus software.

The guy's loaded.

Just last week, some
European company transferred

a couple of mill to
his bank account.

Any word on the
woman in the trunk?

Nothing so far.

Get on that, all right?

I also need you to look
at the dashboard footage

from both squad cars.

Okay.

[feet thumping]

[eerie music]

Just what are we
gonna find on this one?

[laptop beeping]
[keyboard rattling]

[placid music]

This lovely looking
thing femme fatale

is Magdalena Forte,
my soon to be ex-wife.

Don't let the glamor fool
you, she's a bit of a jerk.

You see, that's not me.

That's Eric Valentine, my
supposedly filmmaking partner.

He and I co-directed, I shot it,

and my celebrity wife
was the producer.

The lady in blue is his
latest person of interest.

And the lady in red, that his
wife's twin sister, Marlene.

She'll do whatever it takes
for a part in his next project.

So, where's his wife, Lilliana?

Apparently they could
only muster up two invites

for the screening, I'm
just the cinematographer,

and Lilliana's just
a supporting actress.

So, no red carpets for us.

That dude there, looking
back to the trailer monitor

is Henry Greenberg,
Eric's managing.

He's making sure Eric
doesn't get totally wasted

before his Q and A
after the screening.

He's also making
sure Eric and my wife

don't have a lover's quarrel

when they're supposed
to promote the film.

Meanwhile, back in Eric's
production high out,

I'm setting up cameras for
a live show that will air

in the very monitoring they're
using to show the trailer.

And Eric's wife, Lilliana?

Well, she's the fucking star.

[blade grinding]
Nice.

Gotta give it to you, Eric,

you own some pretty
bad ass gear.

I sold those receipts
for the Alexa bodies,

but the ship date's
for next month.

[feet thumping]

So, I would have
thought you would have

at least taken the Epic
with you to Khan's.

But like you told
your line producer,

why transfer it overseas what
you can rent for cheaper?

So awesome, love
these RED Pro Primes.

So underrated for the price.

Complained about this?

Oh, you're just a snob, right?

You left the GoPros behind too.

So, I'm guessing
you finally bought

those Blackmagic cameras
you've been ranting about.

These microphones
are pretty good too.

Aren't GoPros awesome?

You can put 'em anywhere.

I'm sure your red carpet sendoff

is gonna be a great
warmup for France,

but I'm having
quite a bit of fun

with a small but interesting
crew, including Henry,

the bouncer that punched
you out last summer.

He's our boom operator.

And Paco, your
favorite custodian,

who you hated because you swear

you caught both our
wives checking him out.

Well now, when I
hustled up the crew

and broke into your apartment,

he's the first guy I thought of.

[upbeat music]

[blade grinding]
Tada, this is the money shot,

but don't get me wrong.

These other angles would
be pretty good too.

You know, I always
deliver you your coverage.

[placid music]
We've never had to go back

to a location because we
didn't get enough coverage.

[machine rattling]

Our movie star's here.
[feet thumping]

[door rattling]

Wow, Manny, what
a setup [laughs].

Whoa, your wife is looking
especially hot today, Eric.

I'm gonna love this.
Manny, why so many cameras?

you're a star, Lilliana,

you're a fucking star.
Well, I brought

four different outfits,
I hope you like them.

I'm gonna like them.

But I have a feeling you're
probably just gonna need one.

Which one do you want
me to try on first?

Surprise me, Lilliana.

Go in the bathroom and put
on whichever one you want.

No matter what you wear,

the audience is just gonna
want you to take it off.


What about makeup?

Don't you dare hid
that beautiful face

behind a single ounce of makeup.

I'm gonna finish setting up.

All right, I'm gonna
change while you set up.

Don't change too much.

Remember, make me look good.

Looking good is
your department.

I'm just here to
make you a star.

This is the camera
you'll be favoring

as you get choked out
into its fixation,

while you will climax
during intercourse.

I know, crazy, right?

That's how Kung Fu died, right?

Hanging from a noose with
his pecker in his hand?

That's what Eric here told
me at the Christmas party.

Anywho, Paco, our
male feature actor

will be lying right
here on your pillow

as your wife crawls up
into our A camera angle

for the big finish,
and guess what?

I'm gonna recruit
just like you like it.

Most cameras remain static,
yet strategically placed,

and check this out.

We'll save even more
money on this freebie

by using your neighborhood
free labor crew.

How's that for cutting corners?

Hey, I didn't even bother with
casting notices on agencies.

Who needs agency when
assholes like you brag

to the fellows that their
wife loves getting choked out

and that she fucks
like a woman possessed?

Really man, guys like you
who share the sexual exploits

with other guys are
just asking for this.

Well now, old husband of mine,

I'm finally number
one on the call sheet.

Hopefully I won't ruin this.

But hey, what
do you always say?

Save money, gold and tits
trump talent any day.

We get it now, Eric, we're
gonna try it your way.

No deal memo and no permits.

That's why we're
here in your office.

No permits necessary.

I can't just set
four static cameras

and hope we get lucky.

[feet thumping]

Well, I'm kinda nervous,
that rarely happens.

I guess this is
gonna be special.

I know, Eric, a little cheesy,
but fitting, don't you think?

Manny, I'm ready.

Paco, clap three times.

[Paco clapping]
[sensual music]

â™ª Don't fall, falling
for your lies, girl â™ª

â™ª Babe will get to you â™ª

â™ª And it drives me gone and
baby, shining to the sun â™ª

â™ª I know the look now,
you're heading for lies â™ª

â™ª Don't fall for the
smile of your eyes â™ª

â™ª You're bound to get me â™ª

â™ª To need you be there
just for mine, yeah â™ª

â™ª You think you're better for
you, fallen angel's eyes â™ª

â™ª And the song of your heart â™ª

â™ª The song you love,
yeah [mumbles] â™ª

â™ª See that lie â™ª

â™ª If you see that lie â™ª

â™ª Set her own pace â™ª

â™ª She'll never tell you â™ª

â™ª Down, down, down
to fallen angel â™ª

â™ª Angel eyes â™ª

â™ª Angel eyes â™ª

and me for so long, Eric.

But with Manny's wife,
you got yourself a ticket

to ride, didn't you?

Hollywood is just
way too far away

without a shortcut, huh?

So sad when ambition makes
a fool of us all, Eric.

But damn, why would you share

how we make love
with your friends?

Didn't you love me?

Didn't I belong to only you?

Just you and me for so long.

wait, think about it.

They're there right
now at the festival.

Your husband and my wife.

You got this.

[sensual music]

[eerie music]

[Paco grunting]

[beads rattling]

[wind howling]

[Paco thumping]

[Manny grunting]

[door rattling]

[camera assistant thumping]

[tense music]

[Lilliana growling]

Boy, there's some pretty
sick people out there.

I suppose you're gonna
tell me that was real.

Maybe you should
check out Mount Olive.

What's that?
A church.

And what do you
think I'm gonna find?

Perhaps an answer
to your question.

[upbeat music]
[women laughing]

How could four gorgeous women
like us be going home alone?

It's tragic, but at least
we have each other [laughs].

I wouldn't call it a loss.

There was one guy at that
party worth pursuing.

[Minka laughing]

What the hell?

Hey, it's not to late
to help me stop this.

[chair grinding]

[door slamming]
[placid music]

Detective Semler's
in critical condition.

He's coughing up blood
from internal bleeding.

They don't know if
they can stop it.

Jesus.
Are you okay?

I must be coming
down at something.

Schneider didn't
kill the officers.

It was Officer Schiano.
What?

He shot his partner first,

and then the two others before
turning the gun on himself.

There's no way it
happened that way.

Yeah.

What about the woman,
what'd you find on the woman?

Her name's Vala Schneider,
she's Ansel's wife.

[eerie music]
Where is she now?

I called the Mercy, but the
ambulance hasn't arrived yet.

We'll get an APB out now.
Yeah.

[crickets chirping]
[heels clicking]

no, no, no, no, no!


[eerie music]

Oh my God, oh my God!
[women screaming]

I don't know where we are,

but there's an ambulance

and there's blood
fucking everywhere!

in Orange Grove Drive.

Orange Grove Drive,
Orange Grove Drive,

but there's blood everywhere!

[women screaming]
Oh my God!

[tense music]

Why didn't you tell
me she was your wife?

It's more
complicated than that.

Well, maybe this will
give us some answers.

what you're doing, Detective.

[keyboard rattling]

[birds chirping]
[bell ringing]

[gravel crunching]

[dog barking]

Well, hello everyone,
Faith Daniels here.

Well, as you can see,
today's a beautiful day

to mark a new beginning
for our congregation.

It is our final fundraiser.

And if all goes
according to plan,

we'll have nearly
reached our goals

And well, we've been
through so, so much, and.

Keep going, Faith,

you're doing fine.
Okay, thank you, Louis.

Follow me.
[tense music]

So, as I was saying,
we've been through so much

in our congregation,
and it warms my heart

to see everyone pull together

and helped save this beloved
little chapel of ours.

This place has a lot of history,

and I'm really glad that
that we're able not only

to preserve it, but also
make it, make it stronger.

have done it without you.

Yeah, totally, we
wouldn't be here right now

if it wasn't for you, my turn.

And let's not
forget, we also have

the hottest God fearing babe.

[Faith laughing]
Now then, Devin.

Sorry, Faith, keep going.

It's okay, Louis,
why don't we check

in with Minister Malcom?

No, that sounds really great.

Yeah, uh-huh, well,
well, thanks so much.

Okay then, real good.

Listen, thanks so much
for all your support.

No, really, it's a
real pleasant surprise.

It's really gonna put Sunnyside
on much firmer ground.

Uh-huh, yup, okay,

All right, all right,
all right, yeah, sure.

Thanks, thanks again,
okay, okay, bye.

[phone beeping]

the pleasant surprise?

ready for more good news?


No, no, no, seriously,
like, are you ready?

'Cause like really,
really, really ready?

[Faith] Yeah, I'm ready.
Well I need you to be ready.

[Louis] We're ready.
We're ready.

Okay, that was
an anonymous donor

I just got off the phone
with, a really generous one.

And they read about the
terrible blasphemous vandalism

that nearly destroyed us,

and they read about the fundraiser
efforts that you, Faith,

started to help keep us alive.

They wanna help.

that's incredible.

We almost reached our goals,
so really every bit counts.

Yeah, yeah.
[Faith] That's great.

They wanna match our total.

[Malcom laughing]

Oh my God, Malcom,
that's incredible!

Yeah [laughs].
[Faith] That's wonderful.

What's going on?
[Louis] An anonymous donor

came through, we're going to
exceed our fundraising goal.

No way, fucking sweet!
Ugh, it's sweet indeed,

Devin, come here, son.

All right, listen, I want
you to watch your language

in our house of worship, okay?

Oh, and be nice Ms. Daniels.

You know how much
she means to me.

Sorry, Faith.

[feet thumping]

So, Minister Malcom,

care to recap today's
amazing events?

Yes, yes, yes, definitely.

Well, to put it bluntly,
we really did bring it,

as the kids said, we
raised enough funds

to finish our repairs and to
add extra security cameras.

We're going to continue to
protect the congregation

and ensure that this
never happens again.

Now, thanks in large part
to the amazing work done

by Faith Daniels, who helped
mobilize a ground swell

of support and awareness,
[dog barking]

we continue to receive
love from our Lord.

Just when we thought things
couldn't get any better,

we received an
anonymous call, who now,

stay with me on this,

he promised that he's
going to match every dollar

that we've raised already.
[man clapping]

We are truly, truly blessed.


Now, Malcom, if you could
please let the folks

who couldn't be
here with us today,

know what this match actually
entails, that would be great.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely,
this is the best part now.

Now to receive our donation,

our donor has asked
us to participate

in a geo stash game.

Now, all right, all right,

I know we're not the
most tech savvy bunch,

but I think this looks
like a lot of fun.

Now, basically this is a...

All right, Faith, help
me out here, what is it?


A scavenger
hunt, right, right.

But it's done with this little
app that it gives us clues

and it helps guide
us to our location.

Now, Faith here has decided
to be our geo stasher.

[Faith] Mm-hmm.
She has to find five items

that are stashed nearby and
in fairly close locations.

Are you ready, Faith?
[Faith] I'm ready.

Great, let's have a
little prayer, shall we?


[camera rattling]
[woman coughing]

Conqueror of the
assailant of knowledge,

You've changed the
universe forever.

And Your foot rests on his
back in endless victory.

Applause echoes
throughout the cosmos

in eternal celebration.

On the highest mountain top,

You reveal Your glory
to those who choose.

Amen.
Amen.

[vehicle droning]
[birds chirping]

Lord be with you.

Thank you, Louis, may
the Lord be with you too.

good luck, see you soon.

Bye everybody, see you soon.

[birds chirping]
[placid music]

[keys rattling]
[cicadas chirping]

[phone beeping]

And we're off.

[bag rattling]
[upbeat music]

[door rattling]
[feet thumping]

[door slamming]

[camera whirring]
[feet thumping]

[phone beeping]

[eerie music]
[feet thumping]

Stairway to heaven,
mm, where are you?

[leaves rustling]

Oh, what, where?
[phone beeping]

I don't get it.

What, oh my God, really?

[eerie music]

All right, here we go.

[ladder rattling]
Oh God, I don't like heights.

Oh, there we go.
[crow cawing]

Come with me.
[ladder rattling]

I can't believe I'm doing this.

And we're off.

[leaves rustling]
Okay.

Oh, all right.

Let's see what we got here.

Oh, okay, that's
interesting, what is this?

One stash, four to go.

[leaves crunching]
[placid music]

Oh, hold on, okay,
all right, here we go.

[phone beeping]

stumped them all.

[leaves rustling]

[crickets chirping]


[leaves rustling]

What was that?

[wind howling]
Okay [pants] okay.

This is starting to not be
fun anymore, here we go, okay.

What, but what the heck is this?

[toads creaking]

Let's just go.

[monkey howling]

Oh, oh, isn't this nice?
[eerie music]

[baby laughing]

Oh my God, that was
so creepy, okay.

Geez, what happened here?

Kids, I guess, I don't know.

Okay, relax.
[phone buzzing]

[phone beeping]

Hey, where have you been?

I tried calling and texting you.

I'm walking around these woods.


I didn't see your
texts coming until now.

So, where are you?
[eerie music]

I have no idea where I am,

and I think I'm about
to find a third stash,

but I gotta tell you, this is
officially not fun anymore.

you're on the third stash?

She found the third
stash, everyone.

What is it?

Oh, I'm not sure,
hold on a sec.

[paper rustling]

Oh, this is classy.

Score Magazine, number
one in big boobs.

Okay, let me see,
oh, I don't know,

it looks like a
bowl of some sort.

[Malcom] Perfect.
Perfect?

I'm sorry, Malcom, I think
our friendly little benefactor

might be just playing
a cool trick on us.

[Malcom] Geez, you think?
Yeah, I'm also cold

and kinda creeped out right now.

Can you just come
and pick me up?

This is over, this is
not going anywhere.

[Malcom] Geez, you think?
I'm sure our little friend

won't mind.
[leaves rustling]

[demon mumbling]
Hello, hello?

[eerie music]
[phone beeping]

Are you there?

[owl hooting]
[leaves rustling]

[wind howling]
[crickets chirping]

Next clue, to rid
the world of evil,

you must get to
its root [pants].

[eerie music]

Wait a second, okay, okay,
okay, oh God, all right, relax.

Okay, it's nothing, oh.

Okay, oh, come on,
come on, come on.

There it is.
[leaves rustling]

Oh, I found it.

[feet thumping]

[camera rattling]
[terrifying music]

Sweet Jesus, what was that?
[eerie music]

Oh, Lord, oh.

[leaves rustling]

What was I thinking in
agreeing to do this?

Oh, damn.
[twigs snapping]

Oh, my God [pants]
I'm outta here.

[crickets chirping]
[eerie music]

Whoa, hey there.

You should watch where
you're walking, Mister.

Ugh, what is that?

Ugh, oh, ew.

It's just a stupid scarecrow.

Oh, what?
[baby crying]

I don't know what that is,
but I'm sick of it, okay.

[leaves crunching]

[stroller rattling]
[baby googling]

Nice night for a walk, isn't it?

Nice, yeah, very nice.

Probably the best
day of my life.

All right.

[eerie music]
[birds chirping]

[pages rustling]
[phone buzzing]

Finally, you better
be close, Mister.

I think only 15 minutes

if the navigation is right.

Sorry, we got cut off before.

I've got some nice
hot chocolate,

a few other treats left
over from the bake sale

for my brave little
scavenger hunter.

Oh, that's very sweet,

but won't be enough
to make me forget

about this freaky night.
[upbeat music]

None of these clues
make any sense, Malcom.

more geo stashing in the dark.

How many did you find?

Four.


you really did give
it your best shot.

You were such a great sport.

What do you mean,
this isn't a prank?

We're not getting the donation?

all the stashes, I'm afraid.

But like I said, A
for effort, my dear.

Yeah, how about L for loser?

God, Malcom, this was
such a waste of time.

I don't wanna let
everybody down.

Sunnyside really needs
that extra money,

and you know it.
[leaves rustling]

Daniels, you did great.

We'll always be proud of you
for the sacrifice you made.

Well, I guess, whatever.

shakes of a lamb's tail.

Bye [sighs].
[phone beeping]

Let's do this.

[camera rattling]
[leaves rustling]

Find hope between a
rock and a hard place.

I need some hope.
[eerie music]

There you are.

Got this.

[leaves rustling]

If you dig one ditch,
then better dig two,

'cause the trap you set
just might be for you.

Okay, let's see.

[lid exploding]
[Faith coughing]

What?

What, who are you?

Go, stay away from
me, [coughs] go, what?

Go away [coughs] stay
away from me, no.

What do you want?

No [coughs] no, no, get away.

[placid music]
[wheelchair rattling]

[TV monitor buzzing]

[eerie music]
[devil worshipers chanting]

Welcome to the party, Faith,
so glad you could join us.

what is this, what?

Shh, shh, shh.

What are you doing?

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

what are you doing [pants]?

Thank you for the
offerings, Faith.

You did well, I'm sure
he will be most pleased.

Louis, Malcom, is this a joke?

Oh, Faith, shh.
I'm not comfortable.

My dear, sweet
Faith, this is no joke.

You are the sixth stash.

[eerie music]
[Faith panting]

Hail, Satan.

[Devil Worshipers]
Hail, Lucifer.

What, what, what are
you doing, let me go?

[Faith gasping]

[Faith screaming]

[hammer thumping]
[placid music]


[hammer thumping]
Stop, stop, please, stop.

[Faith crying]

[hammer thumping]

Why?

All offerings accounted for,
let the ceremony continue.

[Faith gasping]
[Faith crying]

[fire crackling]

[feet thumping]

No [cries] [coughs].

you, Mia, my dear.

Anything for you,
Minister Malcom.

[Malcolm and Mia kissing]

[feet thumping]

What are you doing?

No [screams] [cries]!
[flesh tearing]

[Malcom sipping]

Do I have to?

[Devin coughing]

He also would drink of the
wine of the wrath of God,

which is mixed in full strength
in the cup of his anger.

[Faith gasping]

[Malcom and Devin speaks
in foreign language]

[Faith crying]

That's my boy.

Conqueror of the
assailant of knowledge,

you've changed the
universe forever,

and your foot rests
on Jehovah's back

[placid music]
in endless victory.

Applause echoes
throughout the cosmos,

in eternal celebration on
the highest mountain top,

you reveal your glory
to those who choose.

[eerie music]
[Faith] What's that?

[Satan growling]

My Lord, is that you?

Have you come for us, my Lord?

What's this, what's this
horrible smell [gasps]?

Malcom, don't do
that, don't do that.

Don't do that, Malcom.
[Satan growling]

[Malcom screaming]
[blood splattering]

[Faith gasping]
[arm thumping]

my God, oh, oh [screams]!

[Devin thumping]

[Satan growling]

[devil worshipers screaming]

[hooves thumping]
[Faith screaming]

[door rattling]

Mount Olive, Mount Olive?

Yeah, Dale, listen, it's Frank.

I just watched a
video I think was shot

in your neck of the woods.

It's a church right
outside Mount Olive.

Do you know the one
I'm talking about?

Right, just off the interstate.

Your guys were just there?

I'll be damned, when
did that happen?

Well, the video shows
Satanists sacrificing a woman,

for Christ's sake.

You're telling me that
actually happened?

Jesus, that's unbelievable.

Yeah, we'll get a copy of
the video right out to you.

Yeah, no shit, Dale, that's
one for the books, thanks.

[eerie music]
[door rattling]

There's a whole lot going
on out at Mount Olive.

What else do you know
about that church?

A lot more than
what's on that video.

to the ground last night.

[door rattling]

[Detective Hannigan]
Dispatch received a call

from a woman saying
she found the ambulance

out on Orange Brook Drive.

Is everything okay?

gotta be the drives.

It's gotta be the drive.

I don't know how,

but somehow Schneider
put something in them.

Damned, busting me for
smiling on a cloudy day.

Am I under arrest here or what?

[Police Officer]
Hey, you have a seat.

Yeah, you haven't even
read me my fucking rights.

[Police Officer]
Go take a seat.

Hi.
Oh, hi.

[Police Officer] Did you
hear me, go take a seat?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

That's some nice
stuff you've got.

I'd love to try it on.

Please, you wanna
cuff me, officer?

Yes, you'd probably
enjoy it too much.

Would you take a seat, please?

Seriously dude, time is
money and the rent is due.

And I'll tell you
when you can leave.

[phone ringing]

What's the story
with these guys?

We found them standing in
the middle of the street,

right outside the precinct.

Yeah, one of 'em
had ID, so we ran it.

It turns out these three
went missing three hours away

in Jersey last week.

What are they doing here?

Hey, your guess
is as good as ours.

It killed my dad.

What's he saying?


It's in the church.

Look Sarge, there's
been some crazy shit

going on out there.

You have someone
coming down from Jersey

to pick these guys up.

[Police Officer] That's the
best news I heard all night.

You need to send
someone to the church.

[Police Officer]
We're working on it.

Sergeant Biehn, do me a favor

and give these guys
a seat, all right?

Over to your
left, to your left.

Is everything okay?

I need to see Ansel Schneider.

[Police Officer] He's
not here right now.

It's important.
[eerie music]

There's nothing I
can do about that.

Come on, I can help you out.

[keyboard rattling]

Garcia, get the generators on.

Yes, sir.

[police officer gurgling]
Oh my God [screams].


Do I need a bust out
of the station now?

What the hell,
what's going here?

He said something on the
flash drives caused this.

What?
I don't know.

[gun shooting]

Where's that coming from?

[Sergeant Biehn] Sounds
like the front desk.

[Detective Hannigan]
Who's down there?

[Sergeant Biehn] I
don't know, Howard?

Get Armitage to the ambulance.

[woman screaming]


We have to help him.
[Frank grunting]

I'll handle the suspect.

[door slamming]

[woman screaming]
[Police Officer] Freeze!

[gun shooting]
[Captain Friedkin knocking]

Stop!

[Captain Friedkin] The
whole precinct's under attack!

Whatever you do,
don't go near it!

[Captain Friedkin gurgling]
[blood splattering]

Shit.

[feet stomping]
[gun shooting]

Vala, stop!

You used me, but
this has to end.

[flash drives rattling]

It's already spreading.

The audience was the
target all along.

And you lead them to me.

This isn't a fucking movie.
[flashes rattling]

You don't have to
believe, see for yourself.

They're watching
this now [laughs].
