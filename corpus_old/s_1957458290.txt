HERALD: Hear ye,
hear ye, hear ye!

Lords! Knights! Squires!

And all other
manner of people.

That by the command of Our
Lord, the king of France,

it is strictly prohibited,

on pain of death
and the loss of property,

for anyone here
to be armed,

or to carry
a sword or dagger

unless he be one who has
the express permission

of Our Lord, the king.

Each man is to fight

on horseback and on foot,

armed in the manner
that pleases him,

with any weapon or device
of attack or defense.

Except for weapons or
devices of equal design

or made with
charms or spells

or any other thing that is
forbidden by God and holy church

to all good Christians.

If either combatant should
carry onto the field of battle

any arms that have been
forged with spells,

charms, enchantments,
or any other evil arts,

then so shall the malefactor
be punished as an enemy of God

or as a traitor

or as a murderer.

JACQUES: Tighter. Tighter.

Le Gris.

JACQUES: It's good to see
you, my friend.

Though I do not come
only as a friend.

I'm afraid there's more to
my visit than I have let on.

Speak.

Pierre has charged me with
the collection of debts.

I see.

I have already visited all the
other tenants in his domain.

And now...

You have come
to see me.

I have come
to see you.

These levies are
for military defense.

And you know as well as
anyone our enemy's present.

And we need to be ready.

When have I not been ready to
stand and fight for my king?

JACQUES: You have.

More than any other.

But that's not all
this Pierre wants.

No, what Pierre wants...

Pierre wants the money
that he's rightfully owed.

I don't have it.

This plague has carried
off half my workforce.

My rent collection
is down.

My fields yield half
what they used to.

And the cost of labor
has now risen.

Yes.

How is it the other
vassals paid?

They paid because
I had to insist.

I see.

And now,
you insist upon me?

Let me talk to Pierre.

He's not without reason.

I will explain
your situation.

You are a true friend.

But I cannot return
empty-handed.

Of course not.

Thank you.

Let me see
what I have at hand.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

JACQUES: Think about this.
I have.

You have not.

I will be fighting
under Admiral de Vienne.

The English are looting the
Cotentin Peninsula as we speak.

This plague has taken
your wife and son.

JEAN: I will not stand by
whilst Lower Normandy falls.

Do not let
this obduracy take you.

You have no heir.

If you die, all you have
will revert to Count Pierre.

A fact not lost on
Pierre, I'm certain.

He does not favor me
as he does you.

JACQUES: No,
you have much to live for.

What do I have to live for, here?
What?

A name.

It's too great and storied a name
for you to treat it so recklessly.

Your father has
the captaincy of Belleme.

When he dies,
you will inherit that garrison

and everything that
comes with it.

And I am your friend.

And there are many others like me
who would prefer you not perish.

I don't embark on this
campaign recklessly.

I don't embark on it
just to fight.

Then why?


I am

broke.

I need money.

Yes. Her name is

She's his only daughter.

There's a dowry

Of course, a man would
have to bear the mark

of her father's

I don't imagine one
would suffer too greatly

at the task of
producing an heir.

Gentlemen, welcome.

You fought bravely.

Thank you for hosting us.

I would like to introduce...
Jean de Carrouges.

Your reputation

(GOATS BLEATING)

Property starts

JEAN: So, this is
Aunou-le-Faucon.

This was meant to be
part of Marguerite's dowry.

She loved it here.

And Pierre simply
gave it to you.

In appreciation
of my service.

His accounts were
in complete chaos.

Once I was able to reorder
them and collect the rents due,

everything started functioning
properly, and his fortunes turned.

Gave me this as a
sign of his gratitude.

It's not my doing.

The count is generous
and impetuous.

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

Let us eat.

MARGUERITE: I wish you'd seen
the gardens at Aunou-le-Faucon.

We had roses and lavender.

Then, we shall
have those here.

I remember my father built a swing
on the largest tree in the estate.

I will find the largest
tree and do the same.

I have such wonderful
memories of my summers there.

(TENDER MUSIC PLAYING)

JEAN: (SIGHS) It's a pity Pierre
took that estate from your father.

I know you miss it.

It's the only way he
could pay what he owed.

Pierre then just gave it
to Jacques Le Gris as a gift.

Do all squires enjoy
such lavish gifts?

Le Gris more
than most.

He has become
Pierre's most trusted.

Perhaps Aunou-le-Faucon
is not gone for good.

Perhaps I shall not
let that rest.

Jean.

My love, I have
bled for this king.

He knows of me.

I may have more power
than you think.

I know how powerful
you are.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

I was in Paris
when the news came.

Your father died quietly.

In his sleep.

I am lost.

They tell me I'm to leave
here within a month.

You will do
no such thing.

I will assume
the captaincy.

You will keep your
quarters, your servants.

Everything will be
the way it was...

Jean, have you
not heard?

You're not going to follow
in your father's footsteps

as captain here
at Belleme.

What do you mean?

Why did you have to sue the
count for a piece of land?

Just to impress
your bride.

That land was promised to me.
It was an appeal.

And now, you've made an
enemy of Count Pierre.

It was right.

There's no right.

There is only
the power of men.

You sued him,
and you've made a powerful enemy.

Your father was
a hard man

but there was much about this
world that he understood.

Who then will assume
my father's captaincy?

(SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

PIERRE: Good day!

Join us, my squire.

This is a day
for celebration.

I will not be
staying, milord.

I do not wish to interrupt
such an occasion,

but my honor
compels me to speak.

I was angered,
but I spoke well.

I said to Pierre,

"Can you stand there,
as a man of honor, as my liege lord,

"and say that I am not man enough
to assume my rightful captaincy

"that my grandfather and my father
held for the last 20 years of his life

"and take command
of that garrison

"and hold the fort of
Belleme for my king?"

And what said Pierre?

And there was Le Gris,

whose life I saved,
sitting by his side

with his captaincy,
not even man enough to look at me.

He poisons milord
with evil advice.

Whispered in his ear,
blackening my name.

(CHUCKLES DRYLY)

Surely, you did not
say this.

You did.

We are no longer welcome
at court.

It's a boy.

Oh, wonderful news.

It's been a year
since Belleme.

Perhaps we may
show our faces

so they know we carry on
in spite of this injustice.

A healthy child
in these times

is cause for

He believed he would succeed.
His intentions were good.

He's no fucking fun.

how does a man of war

No, no.

Does that knowledge

Of course.

My accounts are in disarray.

Would you mind bringing your
expertise to bear on my finances?

How can this be?

Rents are late to come in.
The accountants are careless.

Milord, these nobles are holding the money
that they are meant to yield up to you.

The plague has carried off
half our workforce.

Crop yields are down.
Labor costs are up.

I understand the numbers,

and absolutely none of
this is your concern.

There is, of course,
my property here at Bourg.

My good man, no.

What's this here?

ROBERT: Aunou-le-Faucon.

No.

It's one of my most
valuable estates.

It is to be part of
my daughter's dowry.

I cannot just
give it to him.

My friend, Pierre's not asking you
to give him your finest estate.

But Aunou-le-Faucon
is worth twice what I owe.

Well, think of how good it will
feel to be completely without debt.

Reports from the north.

They say there's a father
so desperate,

he'll marry his own daughter
to Jean de Carrouges.

Indeed?

Yes, Robert de Thibouville,
the traitor.

Carrouges needs an heir.

noblewoman in Normandy?

JACQUES:
He needs money as well.

There's much
to recommend her.

She's rich, young.
They say she's beautiful.

Yes, and her father
betrayed the Crown.

I make no apologies
for Robert de Thibouville.

Yeah. Only a shame he wasn't
beheaded for his treason.

He would have been spared
the sight of this humiliation.

Gently.
(STAG GROANS)

Well done, Etienne!
Uh, Charles.

What?

(WOMAN GIGGLES)

JACQUES:
He's suing me.

Oh. Come in.
Take your pants off.

He's suing me!

Who?
Me!

For land that is
rightfully mine.

Jean de Carrouges has filed a
lawsuit for a piece of property.

Why would he sue you
for a piece of property?

Because you gave it
to me.

He's suing you, too.
He's suing us both.


I fail to see the amusement
here, milord.

How do you sue for that
which was never yours?

(WOMEN MOANING)
PIERRE: My squire.

Will you finally submit that I
was right about Jean de Carrouges?

He's saying he will take
the matter to the king.

He has bled
for this king.

My cousin, the king.

WOMAN: Pierre.

So have I bled.
So have you.

My friend,
this matter is settled.

I'd hoped to
surprise you at court.

Now, you have barged in and cast a
pall over a rather promising evening.

So, I will tell you now.

Jean de Carrouges will not be
the new captain at Belleme.

You will be the new
captain at Belleme.

As if by magic.


Carrouges will
be furious.

Too true.
Now take your fucking pants off.

(WOMEN MOANING)
Minor delay.

(WOMEN LAUGHING)

Who wants to help me
restore my previous state?

Come here. (GRUNTS)
(WOMEN GIGGLING)

Come down, my boy!
Le Gris!

I will protect this
fortress of Belleme

as captain

to the best of my ability

against any and all

This is a day

I will not be

Good God, man, tell me you're
not here to sue me again.

(MEN LAUGHING)

Mock me, if you may,

but you cannot change right
from wrong nor wrong from right.

Enlighten me, my squire,
as to what is right.

For as I see it, last time you
emerged was to file suit against me

for land I lawfully owned

and gifted to my most
faithful of squires

for services rendered
by him unto me.

What claim could you possibly
have had to this land?

You have owned it never.

I know all
about your squire.

The squire you
gifted the land to.

The one who holds a captaincy
now that is rightfully mine.

My friend, please.

Come, let us talk in private.
No! No! No!

I shall be heard!

I do not accept this!

My father, for 20 years,
my father...

I've waited for 20 years!

There's not a nobleman in this hall
who would speak ill of your father.

You ask for my rents,
I yield them up.

Here, as a man of honor,

you say I am not the captain?

You say to me
I am not the captain here?

I say to you
whatever I like.

I decide who is the captain
at Belleme.

That is what you prize.

That. That sycophant.

Sycophants all!

I will sue!
I will sue you for this!

In just three years,

you've managed to marry
a traitor's daughter,

sue me for land that never
belonged to you

and to stand before me for the
second time in as many years,

threatening
once again to sue,

all while speaking
of duty and honor.

This is how you serve me?

I serve the king.

Hello.

Thought you were

Aye, great,

good friend.
No, almost,

but I spied candlelight,
and I knew it must be you.

I work better alone.

You make it hard for a man
to get his work done.

I came here to tell you
I will not be joining you

for Crespin's celebration.

Milord?

Too far a ride,
too cold.

We'll stay here and
fuck women of our own.

No.
No.

No, I'm told Jean de
Carrouges will be there.

It's time to
heal this wound.

He will never change.
Why even try?

Because a feud between
your lordship's vassals

brings naught but trouble
and distraction.

PIERRE: Oh, good God.

And because I once stood
godfather to his late son!

I once held a place
in his heart.

Do as you must.

You will get to see
the mysterious wife.

Apparently, he's letting her out
of the dungeon for one time only.

One can only hope he hasn't
taken away her books.

Carrouges' wife reads?

In as many languages
as you do, I'm told.

Strange match.

It is. Will wonders never cease?

Come to the celebration, milord!
PIERRE: No.

Come!
No.

(SPEAKING LATIN)

We will ride from the valley

We could, uh, dine there.

There you go.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

It's a shame we had
not met until tonight.

Is it?

I had no idea what a
lucky man Carrouges was

for having such
a beautiful wife.

From what I have heard,

you have no trouble
acquiring beautiful women.


And from
what I have heard,

we may have a great
deal in common.

What could we possibly
have in common?

Appreciation of one another's
extraordinary good looks.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

You are quite talented
when it comes to flattery.

I only
speak the truth.

And what else?

You are a reader?

Like myself.

I thought it rather dull.

It's a much more challenging

We found ourselves unwelcome
by our Scottish allies.

We laid siege at Wark.

they cannot hear you in the back.

(MEN LAUGHING)

We laid siege at Wark.

Mm.

Milord, I return

with neither plunder

And without five of the nine

Indeed,
I return a knight.

One who curses Scotland and
the hour I set foot there.

PIERRE: Yes.

Word had arrived
ahead of you

of your
calamitous campaign.

A tragic result, Jean,

though, I dare say,
no fault of your command.

Where are you off to now, Jean?

I'm bound for Paris.

I have business with the

That is the second time
you do not call me "sir."

There will not be a third.

(SCATTERED LAUGHS)

No offense intended,

I will not be patronized

by this squire

who lies about court,

and risks nothing!

Nothing.

He may acquire more

find more favor...

...eat more, drink more,

and otherwise,
call himself a man of arms.

But in this hall

and any other,

would I speak to you?

Milady, you must know
it cannot be helped.

My love for you

Do not speak!
You must leave now. Please.

We could not

Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

Speak, my son.

(BELL TOLLING)

I carry a sin that weighs
heavy upon my heart.

What is it, my son?

I have committed
the sin of adultery

against a man I once
considered a friend.

You know
your commandments?

Yes, Father.

I ask forgiveness.

My son,
Matthew tells us,

everyone who looks
at a woman with lust

has already committed adultery
with her in his heart.

But is love a sin, Father?

How can I seek absolution
for love?

This is the work
of the Devil.

This temptress
leads you astray.

Just as Eve lured Adam
from the divine path.

That is not love.

Then why?

God is faithful.

He will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear.

This is a test.

PIERRE: My friend.
Milord.

(CLEARS THROAT) Sit.

(DOOR CLOSES)

You will need to sit.

Drink this.

You should drink
all of it.

There is no other way
to say this

than to speak plainly.
(CLEARS THROAT)

A most unspeakable charge
has been brought against you.

Jean de Carrouges
evidently,

among others,

has been telling any
and all who will listen

that you...

took his wife
against her will.

I know not what to say.

Why would she say that?

Jacques, it is
you and I here.

I must know.
This is a serious matter.

The accusation is false.

Of course, she made the customary
protest, but she is a lady.

It was not
against her will.

Why would I ever
need to do that?

Have you ever known me to
lack the company of women?

No.

But you have not
been yourself of late.

It is true, I confess,
it is a feeling I've never had before.

A love...

that I've never known.
It...

It's taken all my strength
not to return to her.

We knew it was wrong,

I confessed my adultery,
and performed my penance.

But I swear to you,
this charge of rape is false.

Of course it's absurd.
It's as I suspected.

But I must
defend my name.

do no such thing.

On my honor, I will, milord.
I must.

I know you yearn to defend
your name and your honor,

but the common mind has no
capacity for this sort of nuance.

They simply don't understand
the world as we do.

They see villains and
heroes, that is all.

Milord...

Deny, deny, deny.

Everywhere, always,
at all times, and to all men.

You did not
commit adultery.

It never happened.

There is no proof.

It will always be your word
against that of Jean de Carrouges.

Yes, milord.

Of course we will have
to endure a public trial,

charges of rape will
be brought against you

and a verdict will be
rendered by your overlord

adjudicating this
matter who,

as the fates
would have it,

happens to be me.

(CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHS)

I hereby find said Jacques Le
Gris to be completely innocent

and wholly without guilt.

I order the criminal
complaint annulled

and stricken
from the record.

Let there be no further
questions about it.

Let there be
no more gossip,

the penalty a
punishment by my hand.

Is that understood?

As to the sworn testimony
of Lady Marguerite,

one can only come to the
conclusion she must have dreamt it.

Now, have these findings
sent immediately to Paris

before this insouciant knight troubles
our king any further with this nonsense.

Yes, speak.

Milord, I have
been informed

that Jean de Carrouges has
already travelled to Paris.

He is filing an appeal to His
Majesty at this very moment.

Cunt.

LE COQ: The benefit of clergy.

There really is
no decision to make.

You're a cleric
in minor orders.

So, you can escape the
jurisdiction of the secular courts

and be tried
by the Church

where conditions are
more favorable.

Men holding church office

number disproportionately
among those accused of rape.

They escape serious punishment by
claiming benefit of clergy, so...

we'll have the church try your
case and be done with the matter.

But what of my name?


Was there

an affair?

Absolutely not.

It's strange she would claim
rape and risk her life.

Why would she do this?

All of France is talking about
this, and I'm innocent.

I've said publicly
that this never happened!

And yet,
under extraordinary pressure

and at great risk
to her name and reputation,

Lady Marguerite has
said that it did.

Formally, this is
not about her.

Rape is not a crime
against a woman.

It is a property crime
against her male guardian.

In this case,
Jean de Carrouges.

This is not a matter over which a
duel should be fought to the death.

It should be
settled quietly.

Take the benefit of clergy.

I'm not a coward.

Most excellent and powerful
king and our sovereign lord,

I present myself,

Jacques Le Gris,

squire and defendant,

and I do hereby deny

all the aforesaid charges,

especially

of Jean de Carrouges,

that I did unlawfully...

and carnally

know his wife,

the Lady Marguerite de
Carrouges,

in the third week
of January last,

or at any other time.

And I further maintain,
saving the honor of Your Majesty,

that the said knight

has falsely

and wickedly lied!

And that he is false

and wicked
to say this thing.

And I further maintain...

and with the aid of God,

and with Our Lady,

I pledge to do whatever is
necessary to prove my innocence.

The knight and the squire
have spoken well.

It is ordered now that the
parties present the affidavits

which, the court
having received,

will render a verdict
upon in a fortnight.

If either man

attempts to flee Paris,

it will be taken as
a sign of his guilt.

Orders will be issued
for his summary arrest

and he will be hanged.

(PEOPLE GASP)

The king will decide if a duel
should indeed be fought.

What now?

DOWRY LAWYER: You will
have 330 livres in coin,

furnishings, cloth, and jewels

in addition to the estate
at Mont a Gudot as well as...

And what of
Aunou-le-Faucon?

Uh, I was forced to sell that
property to Count Pierre.

JEAN: You and I agreed
this land should be assumed

by whomever marries
your daughter.


(LOW MURMURING)

Is this not part
of the dowry?

ROBERT: I was unable
to pay my rents.

JEAN: You promised me.

We discussed this.

ROBERT: My daughter comes with the
money and the land that I've offered.

That is all that I own.

And what
of the bride price?

I offer you
a name of value.

I should expect she's capable
of performing her wifely duties?

Bearing an heir.

ROBERT: My daughter
is strong and healthy

and ready to honor
the marriage.

The conception of an heir and
children to follow shall be swift.

And prolific.

be arranged regardless.

How can you speak like this?

I should not be seen

But you would die happy.

He's handsome.

but my husband

go much further than a threat.

Even if you don't mean it.

JEAN: While I'm gone,

besides a bountiful harvest,

our fortunes will turn most on
the breeding of these horses.

And the collection

Yes, of course.

Of course.

So why is she penned up?

Before my master left,
he had told me to do so.

My husband knows much

It would be better

to be roaming free.

Then she shall roam free.

Thank you, milady.

It's been hard

If we are to sow the oats

then we must be

I should like to
use the horses.

Yes, but we never use the
horses for that purpose.

My master feels
they are too valuable.

They will be of no value if they
starve to death this winter.

See that it's done.

Right away.

I see you have some sun

You look well.

(CLEARS THROAT)

Things seem to be
running quite well.

I enjoy doing
these tasks.

It's my pleasure.

Until he returns
from Scotland,

of course.

It is unfortunate,
however,

that you've not
been capable

of steering your husband away
from conflict with others.

Jean does what he feels
is necessary.

May I ask what you're making?
It looks lovely.

(SMACKS LIPS)
I say with sorrow,

something

apparently fruitless.

You are very cruel.

I am a good wife.

As long as you are fulfilling
your wifely duties.

Or perhaps you cannot
be pleased.

DOCTOR: How is your sleep?

MARGUERITE: Often interrupted.

DOCTOR: Flaccid joints.

Bitter taste in the mouth?

I don't know.

My lady, it appears you are suffering
from an imbalance of the four humors,

primarily black bile.

You are severely
melancholic,

your body is
cold and dry.

Perhaps this,

combined with various
other factors,

including God's will,

could be
preventing conception.


It is imperative that you
have a pleasurable conclusion

similar to your husband's,
in order to conceive a child.

You achieve this?

Yes.

You find intercourse with
your husband pleasurable?

Yes, of course, Doctor.

Although I am not certain
I am experiencing

"the little death,"
as they say.

But if you find it
pleasurable, then you are.


When Jean returns,
he shall be grateful

as I have put the books in order,
as well as everything else.

Perhaps he won't mind
the expense.

Let us both get dresses.

Surprise your new husband.

MARIE:
He would not approve.

He would say I have
enough dresses.

I've only been married
a short time,

yet I now understand the
burden of this arrangement.

You are a newlywed.

Surely you do not
feel burdened.

Bernard is a frugal man

and he does not like
to kiss me.

I once thought his appearance
would become more pleasing,

but, instead,
it's become more repulsive.

So I suppose I am relieved

about the kissing.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

He is not like Jean,
handsome and generous.

My marriage is not
without its problems.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(SOFT FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING)

TAILOR: I shall be right with
you, ladies.

Thank you.

(COMMOTION OUTSIDE)
(HORSE WHINNIES)

Despite Le Gris'
many deplorable qualities,

one cannot be blind
to his appearance.

Crude as he is.

Offensive as well.

They're all such fools.
Hmm.

Agreed.

(BELL CLANGS)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(TRUMPET BLOWING FANFARE)

Welcome back, sire.

(SIGHS HAPPILY)

Welcome home, my love.


I am so happy
to see you.

JEAN:
My God, Marguerite,

have you lost your dignity?

Go upstairs before the
others think you a harlot.

I am your wife.

Welcome home,
my courageous son.

Thank you.

NICOLE: Had I seen the gown
or known it was being made,

I would've stopped it.

And how would you have
done that in my household?

I wonder.

Are you gonna let your wife
speak to me in a tone like this?

Marguerite is a grown
woman, Mother.

The decisions she makes
are her own.

As well as
the lessons learned.

Tomorrow I must go to Paris.

I'll be away one week.

But you are ill.
You must stay here, indoors.

Yes, please stay.

JEAN: I'm owed money.

I intend to collect it.
MARGUERITE: Of course.

Perhaps you may
visit some old friends.

Le Gris is in Argentan.

Why Le Gris?

Please ensure Alice is
with her while I'm away.

I forbid you from
leaving the grounds.

It's not safe.

I... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

I should like to
see my friends.

We're so isolated.

Precisely.

Mm.

(SCOFFS QUIETLY)

(SOFT CHORAL MUSIC PLAYING)

DRIVER: Whoa!

Are you leaving?
NICOLE: Yes.

Well, when will
you return?

When my tasks
are completed.

Before nightfall.

Jean insisted I not be left alone.
You heard him.

Antoine!
ANTOINE: Hyah!

Sow! (SCOFFS)

ten, eleven, twelve...

(BANGING ON DOOR)


(DOG GROWLS)

Stay.

(DOOR BANGING CONTINUES)

Who is there?

LOUVEL: It is I.

Adam Louvel, milady.

Uh... (CHUCKLES)

Adam Louvel?

Hello.
LOUVEL: I, uh...

I have a great favor
to ask.

My horse has thrown a shoe.
Uh...

Nobody is here. I am not
permitted to open the door.

LOUVEL: Of course.
I understand.

If I could...

Could I wait inside
while he's reshod?

Just to warm myself
for a moment.

I...
Will not be long at all.

Uh, it's just
an inconvenience.

I'm so sorry to have to ask.
Please.

Oh, I'm not alone.

Milady, forgive me
for intruding.


I love you.

More than any other.

And I would do
anything for you.

Everything I have
is yours.


How can you
speak to me this way?

Marguerite, what way then
would I speak to you?

Milady must know
it cannot be helped.

My love for you
has consumed me.

How dare you?

Milady, when milord sets
his course for love...

You must leave now. Please.

You heard the lady!
Leave us.

LOUVEL: Milord.

(LOCKS DOOR)

I am married.
Yes.

And you are saddled
with a terrible burden.


A cold, callous man who
does not love you as I do.

Who cannot appreciate you
for the marvel that you are.

Oh, please,
do not speak of my husband.

I want only
for your happiness.

I cannot bear to see
you in such hardship.

I know your house's
finances are fragile.

My lord provides for me.

Yes.

(SOFT OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

But does he know you
to be the most exquisite,

fascinating woman?

A woman I would devote
my whole life to.

Ah, hear me say
I'm in love with you.

And I know

you love me too.
You must.

You must leave.
Please.

(BREATHING SHAKILY)


Marguerite,
do not fight this.

(CONTINUES GASPING)





Jeanette!


If you run,
I will only chase you.

(BREATHING SHAKILY)




No! No! (CRYING)

(CONTINUES CRYING)
Come here.

(JACQUES SHUSHING)

No.


(SHUSHING)
(WHIMPERING)

(JACQUES GRUNTS, PANTS)

(INHALES DEEPLY, CRIES)


JACQUES: Oh,
you feel yourself guilty.

Oh, but, my love,
I beseech you, tell no one.

For your own safety.

If your husband hears of this,
he may kill you.

Say nothing.

(CRYING SOFTLY)


Do not feel badly,
my love.

We could not
help ourselves.

ALICE:
Milady, we've returned.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

She was trying a new cook,
and the dish was quite tasty,

save for the cheese.

I've never enjoyed this particular
cheese, but sadly, it's everywhere.

Thank you.

There is one example,

and I've forgotten
the name of it, um...

it has various colors laced through it.
Oh, uh...

Do you know
the name of this cheese?

I think that
it is Roquefort.

No. No, no, not Roquefort.
It's not as strong as Roquefort.

(VOICE FADING)
But it has a certain texture

that is very good in cookery.


You haven't been eating.

Are you ill?


Lady Carrouges has enquired
about your state of mind.

Uh, my state of mind is fine.
Thank you, Alice.

(BANGING ON DOOR)

Do not open the door.

It's Marie. I'm here to see Marguerite.
Is she in?


Fine.

It's me.

ALICE: Come on in.
Good day.

Marguerite! (SQUEALS)

I've never felt such joy.
I'm pregnant.

I'm pregnant.

Are you...
Are you all right?

You don't seem yourself.

Are you not happy for me?

I'm so very pleased for you.
(CHUCKLES)

(HORSE WHINNIES)

(DOG BARKS)

MAN: Sire.

(DOOR OPENS)

I have missed you.

Did you not miss me?

Oh, I missed you
more than you know.

Then let us go to bed.
Jean...

Marguerite, I've been away for many days.
I cannot.

What do you mean,
you cannot?

Well, um,
I need to tell you something.

What?


What?
(SETS CUP DOWN)

While you were gone, there was a
day when your mother had business

in Saint Pierre.

Yes.

And shortly after,
a man came, unannounced.

I knew the man,
so I let him in.

But he was not alone.

Jacques Le Gris entered our home
without my permission and...

What about Le Gris?
He forced me to this room.

To this bed.

He raped me.

Are you telling me
the truth?

Please.

telling me the truth?

Jean, please! I am telling you the truth.
You must believe me.

I screamed.

I screamed until
I lost my voice.

He forced you?

He raped me.

You did not provoke this?
No, Jean.

Could you not run?

I was pinned down,
I could not breathe.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(GRUNTS, GASPS)

(CONTINUES SHOUTING) Can this
man do nothing but evil to me?

Jean, I intend
to speak the truth.

I will not be silent.

I have no legal standing
without your support.

Then you shall
have it.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

Come.

I will not allow him to be the
last man to have known you.

Jean...
Come.

(SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES)


PRIEST: Milady,

do you swear upon your life

that what you say is true?

I swear it.

Will you swear it
before God?

And all of France?

I will.

Then we fight.

Marguerite is my wife

and we have been wronged.

I will not allow it
to go unpunished.

Your only avenue
is through Pierre.

Though I doubt he will
give you a hearing.

Tell the story
you heard today.

Tell it anywhere you can
and to all who will listen.

We will be the subject
of gossip.

If the story is known
across Normandy,

Pierre will have to
grant us a hearing.

We have a plan.

Marie?

Stay a while.

Why can't you look at me?

I cannot.

Marie?

Do you not recall?

You said, on one or more occasions,
that you found Le Gris handsome.


So did you.

But I do not
complain of rape.

BERNARD: Marie!


You do not believe me.

I have to go.

No, Jean, no!
This is not what I want!

Not what you want?

Can he not simply be tried for
his crime in the courts?

Pierre is the courts!

If you appeal to the king,
he will only side with Pierre

as he has in the past.


I will not appeal
to the king.

I will appeal to God.

(ROOSTER CROWS IN DISTANCE)

Marguerite,
why have you done this?

Because what happened
to me is wrong.

Men like Le Gris take
women when they want

and how often they want.

Who do you think you are?

My son may die.

That is his choice.
Not mine.

You are no different from the peasants
our soldiers have their way with

when they are at war.

Do they complain?

I cannot be silent.
I must speak.

Marguerite!

All you have done is
bring shame to our family.

I am telling the truth.

The truth
does not matter.


You look at me as if
I were never young.

I was raped.

And despite my protestations
and my revulsion,

did I go crying to my lord

who had better things
to worry about?

No, I stood up,

got on with my life.

But at what cost?

At what cost?

I'm alive.

Well, you have paid a dear
price for that privilege.

LE COQ: I have heard from several
sources that you told others

you found
<i>Monsieur</i> Le Gris handsome.

Perhaps you dreamt
this event,

wishing it to be true.

Yes, a long time ago,
some friends and I agreed

that he was handsome, but I told them
that I knew him to be untrustworthy.

Noticing a man is attractive
reveals nothing but that.

(LOW MURMURING)

LE COQ: And if one of these
women is your dearest friend,

why would she bring this
information to the court?

I do not know.

LE COQ: You've been with Jean
de Carrouges for how many years?

Five.

LE COQ: In that time,

you've not carried a child,

an heir to the family name.

No, <i>monsieur.</i> No.

And yet,
here you are,

six months from the incident
you claim is true,

and you are
six months pregnant.

Perhaps you have
another lover

and accuse Le Gris
to hide this.

I am loyal to my husband.

Do you enjoy having
intercourse with your husband?

(LOW WHISPERING)

Yes, of course.

CLERGY: It is not
a matter of course.

You are fully aware that
you cannot conceive a child

unless you
experience pleasure

at the end.
Yes.

Yes.

And do you experience
pleasure at the end?

Yes. I do.

A rape cannot
cause a pregnancy.

This is just science.

LE COQ: It permits
the court to wonder

if after five years
of marital relations,

your pregnancy is

a coincidence.

Let us say we believe
you are telling the truth

and such an act did,
in fact, take place,

perhaps you enjoyed it

more than you're
willing to admit.

Please, explain to me
how one is to enjoy rape.

Did you
experience pleasure?

LE COQ: Simply answer
the question.

I experienced no pleasure!

(LOW MURMURING)

Are there
any more questions?

If your husband were to lose the duel,
it would demonstrate God's judgment

and reveal you for having
borne false witness.

I understand.

LE COQ: I'm certain
your husband told you,

the penalty for bearing false
witness against a man by a woman,

in the case of rape,

is that you are to be
stripped and shorn,

fitted by the neck
with an iron collar,

lashed to a wooden post,

and summarily burned alive.

Lady Marguerite...

it is quite common

for the accused to burn
for 20 to 30 minutes

before they are dead.

I am telling the truth.

We will proceed
with the duel.

(AUDIENCE GASPS)

(AUDIENCE WHISPERING)

(MARGUERITE SIGHS)


You think Le Gris handsome,
do you?

You have disgraced me

before my king
and all of France.

You knew what would happen to
me should you lose this duel.

You knew and
you didn't tell me.

God will not punish
those who tell the truth.

My fate and our child's fate
will be written,

not by God's will,

but by which old man
will tire first.

How dare you
speak to me this way.

What have I to lose?

I begged you to find another way,
and now I may be burned alive.

I am risking my life for you.
Hmm.

You are risking my life

so you can fight your enemy
and save your pride.

And that could render
our child an orphan.

Or did you not
think of that?

You are a hypocrite.

You are blinded
by your vanity.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)


(BABY COOING)

JEAN: All the preparations
are made.

I'm ready.

I should like to stay
a while longer.

(BABY GURGLES)
(SHUSHING SOFTLY)

Faith, Marguerite.

I finally gave birth to a son who I love
more than I could have ever imagined...

and I may not live
to see him grow.

This was my life.

Had I had known the truth
would deprive me of this love,

I believe I would have done what
many women before me had done.

Nothing.

What you did was right.
Mm.

Not if I die.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

I am not like you, Jean.

A child needs his mother

more than a mother
needs to be right.

Lady,

I hazard my life in combat

You know my cause
is just and true.

MARGUERITE:
I say before all of you,

I spoke the truth.

Let it be
in God's hands.

There'll be rough justice
this day by the grace of God.

Let us pray this ends
like the duel at Flanders.
