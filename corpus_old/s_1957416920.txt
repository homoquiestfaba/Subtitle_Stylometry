I think every
member of congress

should start the day
with a ballet class.

Oh, mother.

There she is,
belle of the ballet.

Hello, dear.

Let me take that
for you. Howâ€™d it go?

Ah, kicked up
a storm.

Hey, come on, you two.
Iâ€™m going to be late
for my breakfast.

Come here.
Phoebe, let him go.

Nell, if we want
this reforestation bill to fly,

we need a right arm
in the senate.

So if you get senator Dietz
to show up at the benefit...

Oh, heâ€™ll be there.
I talked to his wife

at that ridiculous
luncheon for Washington spouses.

Your father adored it.

Dietzâ€™ office
still hasnâ€™t confirmed.

Iâ€™ll pin him down
at the breakfast this
morning. What else?

We need to be back
at the office by 10:00.

Iâ€™ve set up
a conference call

with representatives
Deming and Schofield

on that education
initiative.

Forget the call.
Iâ€™ve already
talked to pat.

Just send Joel over
with the proposal.

Proposal to Schofield
yesterday.

Charlie,
I hate that thing.

Good. Iâ€™ll get you one.

You all right, sweetie?
Hmm? All right.

O.K. Bye.
Sweetie, you drive carefully.

All right?
Talk to you later. O.K.? Bye.

Charlie, come on!

See ya later.
Iâ€™ll call ya.

Here we are.
Senators!

Hi.
Hi. Yes.

Good to see you.

Kelly Ryan.
How are you?

Hello.
You know Mrs. Harrington.

We should go on in.
Good to see you.

Iâ€™m glad
we caught up with you.

Good morning, everybody.

Hey, good morning.
Howâ€™d the breakfast go?

I think we got
senator Dietz
in our pocket.

She nailed it.
All right.

Anything drastic
this morning?

A fund request,
ozone layer statistics,

Doreen is typing
your speech
for tomorrow.

Great. I canâ€™t wait
to read it.

Asap.
No. As soon as possible.

Hey, Charlie,
environmental protection
fund sent me the press kit

for the global warming
benefit.

Nice profile on Nell.
Featured speaker.

This is great.
Sarah, call Leanne at EPF.

Tell her Dietz
is a yes.

Leanneâ€™s getting me
a list of photo ops.

Looks like theyâ€™ve lined up
some really heavy hitters.

Tell them to
go full court press.

Joel, run this over to
Pat Schofieldâ€™s office.

Got it.

What is this
on the fax machine?

Junk mail.
A Chinese menu.

Listen, donâ€™t anybody
order from panda Jade
garden, right?

Your 10:00 is early.
Jerry...

Barbetto, right.

I gave him a decaf
and sent him inside.

Nell, when you
get a minute,
itâ€™s from EPF.

Good.
Oh, we got this.


They ready to vote?
What bill?

Medicare.
Itâ€™s about time.

Nell, your call
to representative Deming?

Just table it.

Mr. Barbetto,
I am so sorry.

Good morning.
Good morning.

Iâ€™ve just been called
over to the chambers.

You wanna walk over with me?

After you.
Good.

All right, yâ€™all.
See you later.

Bye.
Iâ€™ll make the call.

Whereas the disadvantaged kids

in our healthy start programs

test better emotionally,

educationally,
and nutritionally.

We have a study
from Miami medical...

Rock solid statistics.

The only thing we donâ€™t
have is adequate funding.

Yeah. Isnâ€™t that
always the way?

Listen, why donâ€™t you
send me that Miami study

and anything else youâ€™ve got?
All right?

This slots right into that
legislation Iâ€™m working on.

Itâ€™s a pleasure to meet you.

Well, letâ€™s see if
we can do some good.

Good-bye. Hi.

Now, active
labor contraction. And, go.

[Short breaths]

Perfect. Youâ€™ve got that down.

All right,
letâ€™s try the next.

Yes, Iâ€™m very proud
of us, o.K.?

Now youâ€™re
dilating more.

Weâ€™re going
to switch over

to pattern pace
breathing.

All right? O.K.

[Quick breaths]

I hope youâ€™re this calm
when the baby comes.

I canâ€™t wait.
Just watch my fingers.

You canâ€™t count, Charlie!

Would you stop it?
Just breathe, o.K.?

Iâ€™m getting
the urge to push.

Well, blow. Blow.

Hello. I hope
youâ€™re getting
all of this.

No, the baby seems
to be napping...For once.

I love this.

I love you.

What?

-Nothing.
Iâ€™ll be right back.

What, do you have to?

Iâ€™m not pregnant.

I know.

Youâ€™re the best.

Youâ€™re blocking the view.

Something over
in this corner
over here?

O.K., hit me
with the spot.

Now, she obviously isnâ€™t
as tall as you are, right?

Obviously.

So weâ€™re going to
have to raise the light
up a little bit

so thereâ€™s
no Mike shadow on her.

Or we could just move
the light to the other side,

and then we wouldnâ€™t
have to worry about
that Mike shadow at all.

Iâ€™ll wait outside.

Testing. Howâ€™s this
for volume?

Where the hellâ€™s
that music guy?

Hey, Phoebe.

What are you doing here?

How about a hello?

I heard Nell
was the main event,

but I didnâ€™t expect
to see you.

Does this mean
youâ€™re back in her club?

A lot of changes, frank.

So I see.

Whenâ€™s the baby due?

Uh...six weeks,
five days.

Hey, you look good.

I feel good.

Where you singing
these days?

Iâ€™m not.
Oh, come on.

Something about
doing torch songs

in a slinky, black
maternity dress.

Sounds very nineties.

I quit, frank.
My life was a mess.

Iâ€™m much happier now.
I donâ€™t miss it.

Did I say you did?

Then stop smiling.

Iâ€™m happy to see you.

Long time.

Eh, not so terribly long.

Oh, there you are.

If you could just
sit at the piano
for a minute,

we need
to set levels.

Frank, Charlie Ryan.
We talked on the phone.

I really liked
your demo tape.

Thanks.

This is my wife,
Phoebe.

Yes. Weâ€™ve met.

Why donâ€™t we get started
on this, all right?

Sure.

Come on.
Look at that.

Whatâ€™s that?
Come on.

Come on.

Yes. Beautiful. Perfect.

Simon, weâ€™re going
to be late.

Would you hurry?

Yes, Iâ€™m coming.
All right.

Come on.

Morgana, my darling,
weâ€™re wanted in court.

Simon!

You have to admit
that it would make
quite an entrance.

The animal rights people
would have my hide.

Better your hide
than a minkâ€™s, dear.

Those, I think.

In medieval times,
a falconer Manning
a new bird

would carry it with him
wherever he went,
even to church.

Weâ€™re not going
to church.

There are rumors
of falconers

bringing new birds
to the bedchamber...

Hooded, of course.

Youâ€™re not going to leave
this bird in here.

I just had
the rug cleaned.

No, not tonight,
darling.

Iâ€™ll bring her
back to the mews

on my way
to the car.

Would you please go
and get your tie fixed?

Weâ€™re going to be late
for my speech.

Oh, yes. The speech.

Yes.
How did you like it?

Oh, itâ€™s a corker.

Inspiring, really.
It made me want to go
out and save the planet.

How do you expect
to do that?

You canâ€™t even
tie your tie.

Plant a tree or two,
I suppose.

Well, Iâ€™m glad
you liked it

because if it
goes well,

itâ€™ll be
the springboard

for my senatorial
declaration.

Oh, youâ€™ve decided then.

I think
itâ€™s now or never.

I still remember the day
you came into my classroom,

and I said,
"itâ€™s Joan of arc."

Why, did you think
I heard voices?

No. I thought
youâ€™d lead men into battle.

And so you will.

Thank you.

Oh, youâ€™re
carrying high.

Itâ€™s a boy,
of course. Did you
do ultrasound?

No, we decided to wait
to find out.

Good for you!

Back in my day,
we just took
our chances,

and I got what
I wanted every time.

"She was a Gordian shape
of dazzling hue,

vermilion-spotted, golden,
green, and blue."

Oh, thanks, dad.

Hi, Lorna. I see
youâ€™ve met my daughter.

Yes. Sheâ€™s
a treasure,

and I guarantee you
thatâ€™s a boy.

How lovely.
You look beautiful.

I feel like
a houseboat.

Nonsense. You look
just as you should.

Good evening. Simon.
Ah, Charles.

Charlie, guests...
Whoâ€™ve we got?

So far, guest of honor,

we have got 17
from the house,

we got 4 senators
and a couple of movie stars,

and thereâ€™s
a news crew from CBS.

So Iâ€™d say
weâ€™re batting .600
before the first speech.

Let me take you around,
all right?

Excuse me.

Will you
look at her go?

Like a salmon
up a waterfall.

Charlieâ€™s in heaven.
He lives for this.

So does your mother.

Guess you and I
are here for the ride.

I like to think of
myself as the power
behind the throne.

Personally,
I had more than my fill
of cutthroat politics

chairing the medieval studies
department.

You miss teaching, dad?

Well,
I miss my students,

but Iâ€™m plowing great swaths
through my new book.

I certainly donâ€™t miss
the faculty meetings.

May I get
you ladies a drink?

Oh, yes.
A Martini, please.

Phoebe, Shirley temple
for old timeâ€™s sake?

Nothing.
No? Be right back.

Weâ€™ve heard
too much about the threat
of global warming.

We canâ€™t afford
to distance ourselves

with the language like "threat."

Something that may or
may not come to pass.

Global warming is not a threat
but a crisis in progress.

The Chinese word for crisis

has two different
meanings in English.

Danger and opportunity.

Our earth is already in danger,

so we must seize
this opportunity

to change the behaviors that
cause and continue to cause

an environmental catastrophe
of global proportions.

The most urgent problem
facing us today

is convincing the public
that there is a problem.

But to those
who would say,

"we donâ€™t have
all the facts yet,"

I answer that
when you are hurtling

headlong
towards disaster,

you donâ€™t take a poll,
you take action.

Weâ€™re condemning
this earth to the gallows,

and we must
mend our ways now

if we plan to get out
of this one alive.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

â™ª Tonight
must be the night â™ª

â™ª the one
we wonâ€™t forget â™ª

â™ª weâ€™ll make
good love together â™ª

â™ª make it last forever â™ª

â™ª showtime
is a quarter... â™ªâ™ª

Thatâ€™s beautiful.

You should go up there
and sing.

Charlie, Iâ€™m all mingled out.
Can we go home?

No, Iâ€™m serious. Why donâ€™t
you go take a few numbers?

Itâ€™ll be perfect.

Nobody wants to hear
somebodyâ€™s kid sing.

I hate it
when you say that.

Youâ€™re not someoneâ€™s kid.
Youâ€™re a wonderful singer.

Iâ€™m not going to
sing here.

Come on. Itâ€™s brilliant.

This is Nellâ€™s night,
youâ€™re her daughter...

Sheâ€™d hate it.

Youâ€™re out of your mind.
Sheâ€™d be crazy about it.
Iâ€™ll tell that pianist...

No! I said...
Whatâ€™s the matter?

Will you stop?

You donâ€™t know
how to stop!

Iâ€™m sorry. Excuse me.

Phoebe?

Phoebe?

Yes, mom.

Honey, are you all right?
Are you sick?

Should I call someone?

Iâ€™m fine.

You donâ€™t sound
fine to me.

Iâ€™m tired.

Iâ€™ve been here
for hours,

and if
one more woman
touches my belly,

Iâ€™m going to deck her.

Honey, youâ€™ve been
feeling tired
quite a bit lately.

Thatâ€™s not right.
Maybe you should go
to the doctor again.

Iâ€™ve been on my feet
for hours.

Iâ€™m seven months pregnant.

I guess I was just lucky
to feel terrific
right to the end.

The day before
you were born,

I argued a case before...

The supreme court.
The supreme court.

I won it, too,
and I was back
on the job...

Six days later. Right.
Six days later. Yes, I know.

Hi, Charlie.
Hey.

Are you all right?

Nobody else
seems to thinks so.

Oh, honey...
I think so.

I think you are
stupendous.

Call me a cab.

Sweetie...
Mother, Iâ€™m fine.

Iâ€™m fine. Good night.

I love you.
I love you, too.

Sheâ€™s going to be fine.
Iâ€™ll take her home.

Enjoy yourself.
O.K. You were great.

No, you were great.
You were a hit.

Good-bye. Iâ€™ll talk
to you tomorrow.

Bye-bye.

Ohh...hi, Terry.
Good to see you.

Here. Donâ€™t want you
to catch cold.

You know, Charlie,
you really donâ€™t
have to leave yet.

I can take a cab.

No way. Iâ€™m staying
with you.

Iâ€™m really all right.

I believe you, but
Iâ€™m wrapped here.

Thereâ€™s nothing left
but the mop-up.

I got to get home anyway.
Iâ€™ve got work to do.

Tonight?
Yeah. Why not?

Tonight went
like clockwork.

I feel like
a million bucks.

[Tires screech]

Who taught this
moron to drive?

Save the stunts
for the speedway, all right?

Thank you.

A triumph, Iâ€™d call it...

Your speech in particular.

I was preaching
to the converted.

No, no no, Charlie told me
it raised a great deal of money.

Wiped up, I believe
was his phrase.

Did you talk to Phoebe
this evening?

Yes. I had a perfectly
lovely chat with her
about my new book.

How did she
seem to you?

She seemed fine.

Well, sheâ€™s never
been particularly fond
of these galas.

Theyâ€™re more Charlieâ€™s
meat, but...

You were right
about the earrings.

I got several
compliments.

Iâ€™m usually right.
You used to say always.

Iâ€™m older and wiser now.

Iâ€™m hedging my bets.

[Laughs]

Ahh.


You know what
struck me tonight

as I looked at Phoebe?

It was the flush
of dynastic pride.

My daughter
about to give birth
to my grandchild.

Oh, thereâ€™s no other
way to describe it.

It felt miraculous.

Youâ€™ll be a spectacular
grandfather, daddy.

[Telephone rings]

Oh...sake.
Itâ€™s 1:00 in the morning.

Hello?

What?

Where?

Maâ€™am, you can see
I have my hands full here.

Tell me something.

My son-in-law
and my daughter...

Iâ€™ll be with you
as soon as I can.

Just tell me
theyâ€™re still alive!

Yes, Nell,
they are. They are.

How did you get here?

Iâ€™ve got a friend
who works in the E.R.

He called me.
I got here as soon
as I could.

What happened?
Their car hit a wall.

Phoebeâ€™s not
badly hurt.

Sheâ€™s got
whiplash and
a few bruises,

but theyâ€™re afraid
she might miscarry.

Theyâ€™ve hooked her up
to a fetal monitor.

Representative
Harrington?

Just a minute.
What happened to Charlie?

They donâ€™t know
the extent of the injuries.

Somebody must know
something!

Excuse me, maâ€™am.
Lieutenant Grody,
metropolitan police.

Iâ€™m investigating
your son-in-lawâ€™s
accident.

How badly hurt is he,
lieutenant?

Apparently, he
went right through
the windshield.

The ambulance squad said he
never regained consciousness.

They took him
right into surgery.

But what happened?

Itâ€™s my press secretary.
Just tell me, please.

He took a skid
down an off-ramp

and ran head-on into
a retaining wall.

The road was slick.
There was a chance
he was speeding.

Iâ€™m sorry to tell
you this, maâ€™am,

but my unit checked
out the scene,

and we found
some narcotics.

You mean they were hit
by some crazy, drugged-out...

No, maâ€™am. There were
no other vehicles.

The narcotics were
found in his pocket.

What?
Whose pocket?

Mr. Ryanâ€™s.

Thatâ€™s not possible.

Iâ€™m sorry.
We sent the evidence

down to the lab
for analysis,

but it looks like
weâ€™re talking a couple
grams of cocaine.

No. There must be
some kind of mistake.

No mistake, maâ€™am.
I found it myself.

Weâ€™re still checking,
but heâ€™s probably
facing charges

of illegal possession,
DUI, and reckless
endangerment.

I donâ€™t believe this.

Letâ€™s wait until
we get the blood tests.

Iâ€™ll keep you informed.

Good lord.

I donâ€™t believe it.

Look, Nell, weâ€™re
going to have to keep
this out of the press.

You going
to be all right?

Nell, you all right?

No, Iâ€™m fine.
Iâ€™m fine. Iâ€™m fine.

O.K.

Itâ€™s been two hours.

I havenâ€™t wanted
a cigarette in 15 years.

Sit down for a minute.
Youâ€™ll wear yourself out.

How could Charlie
do something so stupid?

I could just throttle him.

The press is gonna love this.

So much for running
for the senate.

We better see Phoebe.

How can he do that
to her and to the baby?

Nell, stop it.

I just hate being helpless.

I just hate it!
Come on. Sit down. Please.

Oh, Simon. I hope
theyâ€™re all right.

Come on.

I was so happy when
they first started dating.

The two of them getting
together, you know?

Mr. and Mrs. Harrington?

Yes?

You can see your daughter now.

Phoebe, your parents
are here.

Please try not
to get her excited.

Hi, darling.

Charlie...have you seen him?

No oneâ€™s
telling me anything.

Heâ€™s still in surgery.
We donâ€™t know anything.

Theyâ€™re lying.
They have to know
something.

Donâ€™t get worked up now.
Itâ€™s bad for the baby.

They have to know something.

Iâ€™ll go and find out.
Iâ€™ll come right back.

I promise, o.K.?
Just relax.

Darling, theyâ€™re doing
the best they can, Iâ€™m sure.

Charlieâ€™s in good hands.

Everythingâ€™s going to
be all right.

We have been here
for hours,

and no one has
given us one piece of
straight information.

Maâ€™am, Iâ€™m sorry.

Nell.

Howâ€™s Charlie?

It appears to be
a state secret.

Look,
we need to talk.

Over here.

What?

Just sit.

Itâ€™s not good.

The media
picked up the story.

Has anybody been in
here to talk to you?

Reporters? No.

Good. Letâ€™s keep it
that way.

If Charlie is really
involved in drugs,

Iâ€™m not going to
whitewash it for him.

Nobody is talking
about a whitewash,

but heâ€™s the head
of your staff and
your son-in-law.

Weâ€™ll take it head-on.

Iâ€™ll call a press conference,

and then weâ€™ll just come
forward with it ourselves.

Maybe somebody will
respect our honesty.

God knows Iâ€™m going to
need as much help...

Why donâ€™t we
just sit tight

until weâ€™ve got
all the facts?

Mrs. Harrington?

Iâ€™m Dr. Strathwood.

I operated on
your son-in-law.

Oh, no.

Iâ€™m sorry.

No. Charlie.

Oh, Charlie.

Nell, can I, uh...

Damn you, Charlie!

What a waste!

I canâ€™t stand this.

Where is she?

Simon!

Iâ€™m right here, my love.
Heâ€™s gone! Heâ€™s gone.

Charlieâ€™s gone.
I know.

I loved him so much.
I know it.

What were the results
of the drug tests?

Iâ€™m afraid
they were positive.

Well...

There it is.

How are we going
to tell Phoebe?

Letâ€™s tell her that he...

Just got out of surgery.

Maybe by tomorrow...

Heâ€™s not...

Get away from me.

No, itâ€™s not true.

No, is it?

Heâ€™s not dead.
He canâ€™t be.

No! My god, no!

Charlie, please!

Let me get
to my husband, please!

Charlie, please!

God, no!

Oh, no, daddy, no!

Charlie Ryan worked
on my staff for nine years.

Heâ€™s been my administrative
assistant for four years.

Last year, he married
my daughter.

Iâ€™d hoped to be able
to stand here today

and deny allegations,

but I will not lie
to the public.

Hospital blood tests confirmed
that Charlie, my...

My beloved son-in-law Charlie,

was, in fact, using cocaine

at the time of the accident.

I know now what every parent
must feel

in this circumstance.

"How could this happen?"

"How could I be unaware
this was happening?"

[Cameras whir]

I will never accept
Charlieâ€™s death,

and I will never
stop missing him,

and I will never assume,
as I did...

That drug abuse is a problem

that happens to somebody else.

Nobody is safe.

Nobody...

I...

How will this impact your work
in the area of drug abuse?

Perhaps you shouldnâ€™t
proceed if...

I will continue to fight
for anti-drug legislation

and particularly
for drug education.

What is your daughterâ€™s
condition?

Mrs. Ryanâ€™s condition
at this point is stable,

as is the fetusâ€™.

We donâ€™t expect complications.

Representative Harrington,
youâ€™ve had a terrible shock,

and you have my condolences.

In your statement, you claimed
that you had no awareness at all

that your top aide,
a man you saw daily

and under high pressure
for nine years,

might be using cocaine
on the job.

That is correct.

Might it not be possible
that you would also be unaware

of cocaine usage by his wife?

My daughter
is 7 months pregnant.

Isnâ€™t it possible that she
might also be using cocaine?

Absolutely not!

Mrs. Ryanâ€™s blood and urine
were tested for drugs

as a matter of hospital policy.

Both tests came back negative.

Thereâ€™s no story there.

Look, Iâ€™m not gonna be able
to make it till 5:00.

Representative Harringtonâ€™s
office.

No. Iâ€™m sorry. Sheâ€™s not
in the office at this time.

Nell, what are you
doing here?

We didnâ€™t expect
you in so soon.

Life has to
go on somehow,
doesnâ€™t it?

Full-court press
on the educa...

He should be here.

This isnâ€™t right.

No, itâ€™s not right.

Nothing about this
is right.

Whatâ€™s
the response been?

Mixed.

Not what
we hoped for.

So far, only about
40% of the calls
have been positive.

So much for
respecting honesty.

Listen...

You all worked
with Charlie.

Who knew he was on drugs?

You know each other.

You go out together.

Where was he getting cocaine?

How much was he using?

Why didnâ€™t somebody tell me?

I didnâ€™t know.

If I ever find out
that one of you did know

and you didnâ€™t have
the courage to face me,

Iâ€™ll not only fire you,
Iâ€™ll make sure you never
work on the hill again!

I donâ€™t want any more secrets.
Iâ€™ll be at the hospital.

Dr. Adams, Dr. Adams,

please contact Dr. Margolis.

Mom.

Mom.

What? Hmm?

How long have you
been there?

Oh, a couple
of hours.

Did you get
some sleep?

Yecch...

I had horrible dreams.

So did I.

I just want to wake up
and have this all be over.

Did you know that...

Charlie was
using cocaine?

Did you?

What?

Charlie was
using cocaine

when the accident
happened.

I canâ€™t believe
you would think that.

Thereâ€™s got to be a mistake.

He had drugs
in his bloodstream.

Sweetie, what have
I told you ever since
you were a little girl?

You can tell me anything
as long as...

Itâ€™s true.
Itâ€™s true.

Why in the hell
didnâ€™t you tell me

while we could still
do something?

Youâ€™re not using
anything, are you?

No, Iâ€™m not on drugs,
mother.

I havenâ€™t had so much
as a glass of wine

since the day I found out
I was pregnant.

You know that.

I donâ€™t know
anything anymore.

Who would have
thought Charlie

would do something
so stupid?

You donâ€™t know
youâ€™re right about that one.

I do know
you tried pot

when you were
a teenager.

Mom...i was born
in the sixties.

Everybody my age
has tried something,

unless they grew up
in a convent.

No they havenâ€™t.

Itâ€™s like asking someone
from your generation

if theyâ€™ve ever
had a cocktail.

No, itâ€™s not,
and you know it!

Donâ€™t try to pretend
this is normal.

Your husband
is dead,

and I want to know
why it happened.

I want to know
why it happened.

I tried to get him to stop.

At first it was just
something to do for fun,

something to do at a party,
like having a beer,

and then it just
got out of hand.

Heâ€™d promise heâ€™d cut back,

and then heâ€™d sneak out
and buy something.

I...i was worried about him...

But what could I do? I...

I tried everything,
but what could I do?

Oh, god.

Oh, mom!

Shh.

Oh, god! Oh, mom...

Oh, sweetie...

Oh, god!

I miss him so much,
I donâ€™t think
I can stand this.

Oh, god.

But you did speak
to the doctor?

Yes. He said
everything is still
fine with the baby.

Maybe Phoebe could
come home tomorrow.

Oh, but she canâ€™t
go back to their place.

Letâ€™s bring her here.

I think it would
do us all good to get
out of Washington.

Maybe when we get
through with the...

Funeral service...

I could take
some time off.

Letâ€™s just take Phoebe
up to the lake

and stay a while.

What about your plans
to announce for the senate?

Guess thatâ€™ll have
to wait for a while.


Ohh! Ooh!


Oh, theyâ€™re beautiful.
Isnâ€™t she something?

Sheâ€™s great, dad.

[Vehicle approaching]

We picked up some sweet
Cologne at Fescoâ€™s stand.

Do you know they
still have a shoebox for cash

and a sign that says "out
fishing. Take your own change"?

Try that in Washington.

Right. Hi, dear.
Did you have fun?

Yeah, it was fun.

Was she like that
the whole time?

Well, at least she
came out of her room.

Morgana, come on, my lady.

Would you talk to me instead
of the bird for a change?

Oh, Nell, for heavenâ€™s sake.

Well, she wonâ€™t eat,
she wonâ€™t speak,

and the baby is due in a month.

I donâ€™t know how sheâ€™s
going to take care of it.

I donâ€™t know what to do.

And what wound did ever
heal but by degrees?

Oh, stop.

Has he caught any fish?

Not for 10 years.

[Laughing]
Well...

We wonâ€™t starve.

Butter and sugar
from Fescoâ€™s...

A national treasure,
or it should be, anyway.

If I had a nickel
for every ear of corn

I have shucked
on this dock...

Youâ€™d buy me
the moon.

Is that what
I used to say?

All the time.

Well, that was
fairly pretentious
of me, wasnâ€™t it?

Oh, honey...

What can I do
to help you?

Nothing.

I open my eyes
in the morning,

and thereâ€™s
nobody there.

I know it seems
like that now,

but when
the baby comes...

Oh, mother, please donâ€™t
tell me how lucky I am
to have this baby.

I want my husband.
I know you do.

He was the one who
wanted this baby.

I did this for him.
Iâ€™m not ready for this.

I donâ€™t want to
do this alone.

Youâ€™re not going to
be alone.

Yes, I will.

I loved him more
than I loved myself.

Honey...

Mother, please
donâ€™t tell me you
know how I feel,

because you donâ€™t.

Phoebe, I may not know
the right thing to say,

but I am trying.

I know.

I know.

Nothing helps.

[Clock chiming]

Simon, why donâ€™t
you just hand me
that plate?

Iâ€™ll wrap it up.

Maybe sheâ€™ll have it for
a midnight snack or something.

There you go.
Thank you.

Mom?

Hmm? What?

Uhh...

Oh, my god. Whatâ€™s the matter?
What happened? Oh, honey.

Oh...oh...

Weâ€™ve got to get her
to the hospital.
Can you get her?

Here you go. Yeah.
Here we go. Come on.

Iâ€™ll go get a robe
and some towels.

Get her out there
as quickly as possible.

Uhh!

Ok, thereâ€™s the head.

I canâ€™t.
Heart rateâ€™s dropped to 94.

Push!
You can do it, baby! Push!


Youâ€™ve got to help us out now!

Ok. Iâ€™m trying.

We just need you to focus,
once more, o.K.?

Really push his head, o.K.?

O.K. Here it comes.

And push!

Good girl.

Almost.

Yes! There it is!

Hold it! Hold it.
Hold it....

O.K., one more time...
And push!

Push! Push!

Aah!

We got it. We got it.

All right...
Suction her out.
Letâ€™s bag her.

What?

Iâ€™m going to just
give her some oxygen.

Extremities
are still blue.
Heart rateâ€™s 90.

Got it.
What are you doing?

No need to panic.

Sheâ€™s getting pink.
Heart rateâ€™s up.

Whatâ€™s going on?

Itâ€™s o.K. Sheâ€™s
starting to respond.

Showing signs
of reflex.

Good. I.D. Her
and get her to ICN.

Itâ€™s a girl.

She looks so...

Unfinished.

Why, she...Sheâ€™s
trying to cry.

Oh, I wish they
could take those
tubes out of her.

She just
looks so tiny.

Well, she...She
is a month early.

Even so.

Iâ€™m going to go and
find phoebeâ€™s doctor.

Nell?

Dr. Charbonneau?
Excuse me.

Oh. Hi,
Mrs. Harrington.

Have you seen your
granddaughter yet?

Yes, I did.
Could I ask you a few
questions, please?

Iâ€™m in the middle
of rounds...

Could you just tell me,
why was she born premature?

Well, it could
be nutrition,

hormonal imbalances,
overexertion.

In phoebeâ€™s case,
stress is a likely factor.

What about drugs?

If the mother
were using narcotics,

then yes, absolutely,

drugs would
be a factor.

Does Phoebe use drugs?

I donâ€™t know.

Then you better
ask her.

Her husband was killed
in a car crash.

He was using cocaine,

but phoebeâ€™s blood test
came back negative.

Cocaine can be out
of the bloodstream
in 48 hours.

All that would prove
is she hadnâ€™t been
high for two days

when
they tested her.

Arenâ€™t there some tests
you can do on the baby

and on Phoebe
that would...

Yes. Yes, there are.

If we administer them

and either
tests positive,

the mother could
lose the baby
to foster care.

She could also
be prosecuted

for carrying
drugs to a minor
or child abuse.

Are you saying
I shouldnâ€™t pursue this?

Iâ€™m telling
you things that can happen.

Oh...

I read the papers.
I know what youâ€™ve
been going through.

I appreciate that.

I voted for you.

I like your positions
on health care.

Now if youâ€™ll
excuse me,

I have to deliver
some twins.

Dr. Charbonneau,
youâ€™ve seen that baby.

Do you think itâ€™s possible
she was drug-affected?

Yes. It is possible.

Oh...

Hey.

Well, Iâ€™m glad
to see you up and around.

Just went
down the hall.

To get a soda?

I was thirsty.

I see.

Have you seen
the baby yet?

Mom...

Have you?

Itâ€™s the first time
Iâ€™ve been on my feet.

And you went
for a soda?

I donâ€™t want to see it,
all right?

Why, because youâ€™re
afraid to see the
cocaine you took?

Who said I took cocaine?

Donâ€™t lie to me, Phoebe.
I know what you did.

Mother, please.

Do you know sheâ€™s
in critical condition
because of you!

Just listen to what I...

How could you do that
to your baby? How could you?

I hurt, mom.
My husbandâ€™s dead.

I had to do something
to make the pain stop.

You think youâ€™re
the only person in pain
because of Charlie?

I loved him like a son!

Tell me about it.

You two were so tight,
I felt like the in-law.

That is no excuse
for what you did.

You did not have
to take drugs!

Well, I did.
Why?

Because itâ€™s what I know.

Did you
get him started?

I knew it.

I knew youâ€™d blame me
for Charlie.

Answer my question!
Did you or didnâ€™t you?

No, I didnâ€™t!
Charlie got me high...

Our first date together.

Iâ€™d been straight
for three years.

I tried, mom.

I tried to stay clean.

You donâ€™t know
how hard I tried.

Three years?
Exactly.

You mean all
this time sheâ€™s...

And I thought
this was all over

with that business
in high school.

So did I.

Sheâ€™s certainly not going
to tell us the truth,

thatâ€™s for sure.

If we hadnâ€™t sent her to
that boarding school...

Oh! Well, hindsight
is brilliant.

We thought it would help.

No, no. You thought
it would help.

We both did! You agreed.
I knuckled under.

You said, and I quote,

"maybe sheâ€™ll actually
learn something in a more
structured environment."

Ha ha!

Well, obviously she did.

She learned how
to lie better.

How did we miss it?

Well, maybe we...

We were both too busy.

I spent every
spare minute with her.

You were off
on a sabbatical

and I was down
in Washington...

Exactly. We werenâ€™t there.
Now, wait a minute.

Iâ€™m not going to be
made to feel guilty
because I loved my work.

That didnâ€™t mean
I loved Phoebe any less.

Iâ€™m not saying you
loved her less, but...

Maybe we shouldnâ€™t
have had a child.

Well, we did...

And so did Phoebe.

Oh, Iâ€™m sorry.

I thought this was
my daughterâ€™s room.

Thatâ€™s all right.

Oh, it is her room.

Phoebe?

Phoebe?

Mrs. Harrington?
I called you at home.

Your husband said
you were already
on your way.

Well, whereâ€™s Phoebe?
She left.

What?

Apparently,
she just walked out
of the hospital.

Nobody saw her leave.

Oh, now, wait.
Wait a minute.

You mean Phoebe walked
out of the hospital
with the baby?

The baby is still
in intensive care.

Oh, no.

Oh...

I have to ask you
an important question.

If you canâ€™t
locate Phoebe

or if sheâ€™s
in no fit condition,

are you prepared
to take custody of
your granddaughter?

Well...yes, of course.

You might want some time
to consider.

Well...yes. The answer is yes.

Sheâ€™s not critical anymore.

She is starting
to breathe better.

Probably sheâ€™ll be off
the oxygen in a day or so.

How long will she have
to stay in the hospital?

A week, maybe two.

Is that all?

Depends on how well
she takes to the bottle.

Sheâ€™s only a month premature.

Thatâ€™s a big girl for this ward.

If we get her eating,
sheâ€™s ready to roll.

Do you want to hold her?

Well...what about
all the tubes and things?

Itâ€™s all right. We handle
them all the time.

Hello there, darlinâ€™.

[Baby fussing]

Good girl.

[Baby crying]

Ohh. Ohh. Hey.

Itâ€™s o.K.

So...ohh, ohh.

Ohh. Itâ€™s all right.

Itâ€™s all right.
Itâ€™s all right.

Simon, youâ€™re nervous.

Well, sure.
Of course I am.

I havenâ€™t seen her
since the day she was born.

Iâ€™m nervous, too.

Mrs. Harrington.

Itâ€™s good to
see you again.

Oh, hi.

Mr. Harrington?
Margo charbonneau.

Oh, how do you do?

Hi. So, todayâ€™s
the big day.

You all ready?

Not really, but...

Here she is.

Ohh.

Hello, sweetie.

Hello, sweetie. Hello.

Oh, oh,
goodness, yes.

Do you want to go
and see grandpa?

Here you go.

[Baby cries]

Ohh.

Oh, sheâ€™ll get
used to you, Simon.

Yes, she did that to me
at first, too.

Sheâ€™s starting
to recognize you
from the feedings.

Yeah. Did you have
your bottle without
grandma this morning?

No coughing,
no spit-up. A-plus.

Are you going to help
with the feedings?

Oh! Well...

Yes, probably.

Be patient. Itâ€™s harder
with babies whoâ€™ve been
on a feeding tube.

They tend to resist
the nipple.

Are there likely to
be other problems?

Itâ€™s hard to predict,

especially without being
able to ask her mother

exactly what she was
exposed to in utero.

What if it was cocaine?

Thereâ€™s no safe amount
you can take when
youâ€™re pregnant.

The damage depends
on how much, how often,

how far along
was the fetus,

and if Phoebe
was combining it
with other drugs...

Especially alcohol.

Her baby could face
some serious problems.

What can we do
about it?

Be good parents.

Environment will make
all the difference.

I still donâ€™t feel
right about closing the house.

Aw, honey, sheâ€™s not here.

If she were, we wouldâ€™ve
found her a week ago.

But what if she comes back?

Sheâ€™s in Washington.

Thatâ€™s where weâ€™ll find her
and thatâ€™s where we have to go.

Step.

What are we gonna name her?

Her mother will name her.

Ah. There you go.

[Sighs]

Yeah.

Iâ€™m sure you appreciate
the need for discretion

as far as the press
is concerned.

Yeah. Thanks.

Iâ€™m heading for home,
Mrs. Harrington.

Remember,
Iâ€™ll be late tomorrow.

All right, Margaret.
Just as soon as
you can, all right?

Thank you. Good night.
Good night.

If Phoebe does contact you,
just call us collect.

Thanks.

Do you know
last night I dreamed
she drowned in the lake?

Just like Ophelia...

All covered
with flowers.

Theyâ€™re going
to find her.

We called all her friends,
all of Charlieâ€™s.

Itâ€™s really good of
you to give up your
weekend like this.

I appreciate it.
Itâ€™s nothing.

Did you get a chance to go
through all these resumes?

Weâ€™ve got
staff interviews set up
first thing on Monday.

Iâ€™m trying. I trying.

[Baby cries]

Oh, no.

Oh!

Wouldnâ€™t you know?

The minute the sitter leaves.
Yeah.

"I have no name..."

[Babyâ€™s cries drown
out speaking]

"I happy am.

"Joy is my name.

Sweet joy."

Simon,
what are you doing?

Is she wet?

She certainly doesnâ€™t
appreciate Blake.

Give her to me.

I thought
you were working.

I canâ€™t work while
sheâ€™s making all this noise.

Honey, why donâ€™t you
go on to sleep?

Youâ€™ve been up
half the night.

Was Phoebe like this?

Not so piercing.
Certainly not all the time.

I might have been
up for this once
in my salad days.

Good night.
Good night.

Good night.

Ooh, sweetheart.

Shush. Shush.

Granny loves you. Yes.

Youâ€™re all right.

Yes. All right.

All right.

â™ª Mr. Froggy went
a-courtinâ€™ â™ª

â™ª he did ride â™ª

â™ª did ride â™ª

â™ª Mr. Froggy went
a-courtinâ€™ â™ª

â™ª he did ride â™ª

â™ª did ride â™ª

â™ª Mr. Froggy went
a-courtinâ€™ did ride â™ª

â™ª a sword and pistol
by his side â™ª

â™ª mm-hmm â™ª

â™ª mm-hmm â™ª

â™ª mm-hmm â™ªâ™ª

Youâ€™re just like your mama.

She always
loved singing, too.

[Baby cries]
All right.

â™ª Miss Mousie
wonâ€™t you marry me? â™ª

â™ª Mm-hmm â™ªâ™ª

[Doorbell rings]

For heavenâ€™s sakes.

Joel, what is it?

Iâ€™m sorry to come
here so late.

Is that phoebeâ€™s?

Yes. Whatâ€™s the matter?

I have to, uh...

I knew about Charlie.

I figured
Iâ€™d better, uh...

I made
a few phone calls.

I think I know
how to find Phoebe.

Sorry, weâ€™re closed.
Can I help you?

Iâ€™m looking for someone.

All right.

Iâ€™ll see you inside.

Phoebe.

What are you doing here?

I might ask you
the same thing.

Go get your things.
Weâ€™re leaving.

Iâ€™m not going anywhere.

You donâ€™t have a choice.
You have a baby to think about.

Well, itâ€™s my life.

And youâ€™re
my daughter.

And donâ€™t I know it!

What seems to be
the problem, ladies?

It doesnâ€™t
concern you.

Is that where
youâ€™ve been staying?

Itâ€™s none
of your business.

I gave an old friend
a safe place to stay.

Iâ€™m talking
to my daughter!

Stay out of it, frank!

-Youâ€™re sure youâ€™re...
Shut up!

I am not here to argue!
Get out of here!

Mother, will you
leave me alone?

No, I will not
leave you alone!

How dare you?

How dare you walk out
and leave me to pick up
the pieces?

I have been up every
night with that baby,

and I was worried
half out of my mind because
I thought you were dead!

Now, youâ€™re going to start
acting like an adult!

Youâ€™re going to come home
and take care of your baby,

and you are going to
stop taking drugs!

I canâ€™t.
Yes, you can!

You donâ€™t understand.
I canâ€™t.

Yes, I understand,
and you can!

I smoked two packs
of cigarettes every day
for 26 years,

and the day that
I decided to quit, I quit.

And the first time
I ran for congress...

Here we go. Back on
the job six days later.

Why is it every time
I canâ€™t do something

you rub my nose in it
by saying you can?

Why is that, mom?

I am not the issue here!

I may not have been
the easiest mother, but
I did the best I could,

and now itâ€™s your turn.

I canâ€™t do it!

You owe it to Charlie.

How can you say that?

Charlie wanted a child
more than anything...

Stop it!

No! I will not stop
until you promise to come
home and see your baby!

Iâ€™ve seen her.

You told me you didnâ€™t.

She was hooked up
to all these machines.

I looked at her.
She had a convulsion.

I had to get out of there.
I couldnâ€™t stand it.

Phoebe.

Iâ€™m going to
get you out of here
if I have to drag you.

Iâ€™m not going to
stand by and watch you
wreck your life.

I lost Charlie.

Iâ€™m not going to
lose you, too.

Now, you go get
your things.

Go on.

[Baby crying]

[Crying continues]

Nell, you...

Oh, Phoebe.

Thank god.

[Baby crying]

Go ahead.

There, there.

Hello, Olivia.

Oh, hush.

[Baby stops crying]

Oh, damn it. God.

Phoebe, are you all right?

Iâ€™m fine.

Here. Are you sick?

No.

Youâ€™re white as a sheet.
Here, let me have the baby.

Iâ€™ve got her!

Just...

No, she absolutely will
not enter the program
without her baby!

Well, who is equipped...

Sheâ€™s 2 1/2 weeks old.
She was 4 weeks premature.

No. Those private
clinics will not accept
women with babies.

Canâ€™t you just sug...

All right. Thank you.

Weâ€™ll have to discuss it,
but thanks. Thanks very much.

There are hundreds
of thousands

of mothers
with drug problems.

Where do these women go?

Nell, tell me something.

Is this something she wants,
or is this what you want?

This is what
Phoebe needs.

No. Thatâ€™s not
what Iâ€™m asking.

Do you have
another solution?

We have to do something.

Well, I found one.
What?

Itâ€™s a residential recovery
program called family house.

They take pregnant women,
mothers with children.

They have only 14 beds,

and thereâ€™s a waiting list
up to six months.

Well...here.

Yes, this is representative
Nell Harrington.

Well, this looks like
a pretty old house.

What difference
does that make?

Youâ€™re going to be here
for six or eight months...

I said Iâ€™d talk to them.
Thatâ€™s all I said.

Hello. Hi.
Iâ€™m Nell Harrington.

My daughter, Phoebe Ryan.

Hi. Holly Ellis.
Iâ€™m the administrative
director here,

and this is my assistant,
Lucinda.

She does my job
and everybody elseâ€™s
around here.

Hi. Lucinda bernardi,
head of clinical staff.

Hi, Phoebe. Can I get
you a cup of coffee
or something?

Not for me. Darling?

Letâ€™s go up
to my office.

Poor baby.

What we can do is set up
an appointment with a doctor.

She started using cocaine

when Charlie, her husband,
was killed.

How long
had you been taking drugs
before you got pregnant?

Since high school.

Periodically.
Most of the time.

Donâ€™t exaggerate.
Fine.

Look,
thereâ€™s no judgment here.

There isnâ€™t
a right or wrong answer.

Is this your
first pregnancy?

Yes.

Why donâ€™t we let
Phoebe answer, all right?

Phoebe?

She already
told you.

Excuse me.

Lucinda,
would you come up to
my office, please?

Thank you.

Would you leave us
alone for a while?

But I thought...

Iâ€™d like to talk to you
one at a time.

Lucinda will give you
the not-so-grand tour,

and weâ€™ll
ask you to fill out
a family questionnaire.

Just some background,
all right?

Certainly. Be glad to.

[Knock on door]

Yes?

Lucinda, would you
give Mrs. Harrington
the tour, please?

Sure.

Uh, thank you.

Phoebe, what are
you doing here?

What?
Why did you come here?

I already told you.

No, your mother did.
Iâ€™d like to hear it
from you.

I want to take care
of my baby.

But what about you?

Phoebe, youâ€™re not
going to make it here

if you come here
for your baby
or for your mother.

Theyâ€™re not on drugs.
You are.

But you have got
to want to get off.

Tell me, do you want
to get straight?

Yes.

[Telephone ringing]

Phone call.

I donâ€™t know.

All right, then.

Now weâ€™re
getting somewhere.

Hi, Judy.
Hi.

Hi, Jordan.
Come on, honey.

Hello.

We always put
the new residents

in with someone we like
to call a mother peer.

Someone whoâ€™s been on the
program for several months.

And if the mother
already has a child,

theyâ€™re able to be
in here with them.

Phoebe, whatever you did
that you think was so awful

that you canâ€™t
forgive yourself for,

youâ€™re going to hear
the same story from
everyone here.

Itâ€™s like living
with mirrors.

And the residents provide
a lot of the emotional
support system.

They all talk.

They learn a lot
from each other.

[Sighs]

Are you all right?

Yeah. Yeah.

I think Iâ€™m going to
go back downstairs now.

I donâ€™t see what good it does
going over all this.

Because you have to look
at what really happened

without judging
everything you did.

Look, itâ€™s not my fault
if you donâ€™t believe me.

I mean, what do you
want me to do?

Drop your guilt.
I already told you...

What you think
I wanted to hear.

Look, I am not here
to beat you up,

judge you,
or put you down.

You do that all
right by yourself.
Am I right?

Well, obviously.
I fed drugs to my baby.

Yeah.
Uh-huh. You did.

So?

I also took drugs
before Charlie died.

If Iâ€™d known heâ€™d had
some drugs left the night
of the accident,

I probably wouldâ€™ve
spent the whole night
trying to get it.

I was totally
straight for the first
four months, though.

Really.
I didnâ€™t use once.

I believe you.

Yeah, I didnâ€™t think
Iâ€™d get through that.

I had cravings so bad.

I was grinding my teeth...

And sweats and...

Stomach cramps,
nightmares.

Then I ran into
a friend and...And...

He had some pot,
and I smoked it...

And I got started,
and I couldnâ€™t stop.

I lied to Charlie.

I...i...i...

I lied to everyone.

I ran away from my baby.

So what does that
make you?

I wish I were dead.

Well, honey, youâ€™re not.

Youâ€™re a drug addict.

Now, that doesnâ€™t
mean that youâ€™re
a bad person.

That means that
youâ€™re a sick person.

You have an
addictive disease.

Now, what we do here

is show you the steps
towards recovery,

but no one can take
those steps for you.

Weâ€™re done.

Will you take her?

I think Phoebe
belongs in a setting
like this,

but I am in
an awkward position.

Two of our clients
graduate on Monday,

so I have
two beds free.

But I also have women
lined up on the street.

Now, how do I justify
putting your daughter
ahead of them?

Mrs. Ellis, if you
would take Phoebe,

I will pay
for both beds...

Plus the next woman down
on your waiting list.

Will you take her?

Well, you just may have
saved some lives.

Good.

Weâ€™ll put Phoebe straight
into hospital detox,

probably not more
than two or three days.

First we get her
off the drugs,

and then we deal
with the issues
behind the drugs.

Now, I should warn you...

You probably wonâ€™t have
any contact with her
for quite a while.

She wonâ€™t be allowed
to make any phone calls
for the first 14 days

or have any visits for 30.

You wonâ€™t need
those kind of rules
for our family.

Weâ€™re very supportive.

Iâ€™m sure.

But all families
have problems,

even supportive ones.

The babyâ€™s asleep.

Anything the matter?

Ohh...

Phoebeâ€™s out there
in some hospital

going through detox.

Isnâ€™t that
what you wanted?

You knocked yourself
out to get her into
that program.

Did you have
a better suggestion?

Arenâ€™t we just
shipping her off

to a different
boarding school,

paying some
stranger to solve
phoebeâ€™s problems?

Simon, somebody had to.

We just put her away
with a houseful
of drug addicts!

She is a drug addict.
Thatâ€™s what Phoebe is,

and she needs
this kind of help.

We are her parents!

We were her parents
when she got into this mess,

and a fat lot of good
it did us!

Letting her poison
her baby while you were out
flying that stupid bird!

Iâ€™ve had enough
of this, Nell.

I donâ€™t see that
you did much better.

Well, at least
I did something!

"Thinking the deed
and not the creed

would help us in
our utmost need."

Simon, would
you stop that?

Canâ€™t you ever say anything
in your own words?

I donâ€™t have the words
for this, Nell!

Maybe somebody else
would.

I am coping with this
the best way I know how!

Youâ€™re not
coping at all!

Iâ€™ve had to make
every single decision!

Thatâ€™s right, Nell!
Thatâ€™s right! You had to!

Well, as usual,
you dumped the whole
thing in my lap!

Because trying
to reason with you

is like standing
in front of a bulldozer!

No wonder our daughter
takes drugs!

Are you saying
thatâ€™s my fault?

Well, maybe it is.

Oh...no, I didnâ€™t
mean that.

You did mean that.
Nell, Iâ€™m sorry.

Iâ€™m sorry, too.

Nell,
where are you going?

Iâ€™m going to
sleep downstairs.

Nell, donâ€™t do that.
Donâ€™t be ridiculous.

Well, whatever
you all think,

Lucinda and I have
noticed a big lapse
in discipline lately,

so this is going to be
the policy from now on.

Yeah, right.

Ok, and on that note,

Ms. Donna...

You want to tell the house

why you were
two hours late on
your day pass yesterday?

I told you.
I missed my bus.

Next time,
you miss both buses.

What, are you
grounding me?

You got a discipline,
and if you keep
flapping your mouth,

youâ€™ll get two.

What do you think
this is...Boot camp?

This whole house has
an attitude this morning.

What is going on here?

All right. From the gut...
Show of hands.

How many people here
want to be here?

How many need to be here?

Phoebe?

How about you?

Good.

Well, letâ€™s get
this day started.

Womanâ€™s group.

Hey, Iâ€™m Ramona.

Iâ€™m your roommate.

Itâ€™s going to get easier.

Word.

I miss her.

I miss her, too.

I never thought
this would happen
to our family.

Oh, well.

Some things are
out of our hands.

Hmm.

At least weâ€™ll be able
to see her finally,

day after tomorrow.

That place,
with the...

Therapist hanging
on every word.

Does that mean youâ€™re
not going with me?

Should I come with you?

No, not if you
have to ask.

Iâ€™ll take care of it.

Fine.
You take care of it.

You go in and fix it.
You always do.

Do you like it?
Mm-hmm.

â€™cause I could
exchange it.

No, donâ€™t.
Itâ€™s great, really. Mm-hmm.

You look good.
You got some color back.

Are you talking about
anyone in particular?

Iâ€™m talking
about everyone
in particular,

but especially you.

Oh, hey! Youâ€™re phoebeâ€™s mom,
from the congress.

Yeah, we heard
all about you.

Ooh, that sweater
is too cool.

You bring this
for Olivia?

Mm-hmm.

Phoebe,
you got it made.

My mother?

I told her Iâ€™m
checking in here.

She punched my face.

How long have
you been here?

Too long.

Who left dirty
dishes all over
the counter?

Excuse me. We are talking.

Oh, hi. Iâ€™m Ramona.

Oh, you got to
be phoebeâ€™s mother.

You look
like each other.

No, we donâ€™t. Do we?

Yes. I think so.

How long have
you been here, Ramona?

Six months
and five days.

Is it working out?

I love it here.

You love it?

Itâ€™s better
than whatâ€™s on the street.

You got that right.

At least thereâ€™s nobody
trying to kill you,

just making you
follow these rules

day and night.

How did you
all get here?

Bus.


Move your big feet.

Hi. Iâ€™m Tory.
Oh, hi, Tory.

I got hooked on crack

trying to make it through
grad school and hold down
two day jobs.

Day before midterms, I woke
up in the emergency room.

My boyfriend beat me up

when he found out
I was pregnant,

and I just had my hands
like this, saying,

"please, god, if you
spare this baby,

I swear
Iâ€™ll get straight."

Iâ€™d been shunted
around for a year.

I knew I had to
stop drugging,

but I didnâ€™t
trust no one out on the street

to look after my kid.

Was that true
of all of you?

I had to go
to nine programs

before I found one that
would take me pregnant.

You donâ€™t know what
itâ€™s like out there.

You just donâ€™t know.

Senator Dietz
got us an endorsement
from his committee,

and weâ€™ve got
a clear majority on
the house subcommittee,

so all things considered,

weâ€™re on top
of our game with
the reforestation bill.

Great.
Oh, thatâ€™s great.

Charlie would
have been proud.

Yeah. Yeah,
he would have been.

Well, listen.

I have one more
order of business.

Iâ€™ve been doing
some research here

on drug treatment programs
for pregnant women

and women with babies.

You know, there ought to be
a place like family house

in every town
in the United States,

but of course
nobodyâ€™s got any funding.

So, whatâ€™s
your proposal?

I want to go public
with phoebeâ€™s recovery.

I want to call
a press conference,

do a TV segment,
and educate people.

With all due respect, Nell,
youâ€™re out of your mind.

Am I?

Look, you tell
the average voter

you want to spend
government money
on drug-addict mothers,

and heâ€™s gonna say,

"they should just
lock them up and take
their babies away."

And do what with them?

These average voters
want to adopt them?

Or they want their taxes
to pay for these babiesâ€™

foster care or their
special ed classes

or their jail sentences?

And what about
when these babies grow up,

and their babies
have drug problems?

Thatâ€™s the way you see it
because youâ€™re involved.

Oh, wait, wait.

Do you know
that in this country

1 out of 10 babies
is prenatally exposed

to illicit drugs?

What about Phoebe?
How does she feel?

Did you ask her?

No, but I will.
Yes, but, Nell...

If people donâ€™t
come forward and talk
about these problems,

the stigmaâ€™s
going to get worse,

and the battle is just
going to get harder.

Sheâ€™s already
written her speech.

Youâ€™re really
determined to do this
thing, arenâ€™t you?

Yes!

All right. Now, this
is going to help you

calm your baby down
when heâ€™s hysterical.

Youâ€™re going to cradle
his head in one hand

and his rear
in the other.

Ok, so his head is
higher up than his feet,

and you can make...

Eye contact.
Right.

And youâ€™re going to
rock him gently, up and down.

Not back and forth,
that will just wire him more,

up and down,
vertical rocking.

When your baby starts
to quiet down,

try adding some sound.

You can talk, sing,

just so long
as you take it

one step at a time.

Drug babies are what they
call hypersensitive.

Now, we all know
theyâ€™re hyper, right?

But donâ€™t forget sensitive.

These kids understand you
through your fingers,

and you want them to
understand that no matter
what comes down,

youâ€™ll always be there
for them.

[Knock on door]

Excuse me. Phoebe,
can I see you in
my office, please?

Your motherâ€™s here.

Aw, Phoebe, whatâ€™s she
bringing you this time?

Take her?

Thanks.

You want me to go on TV

and tell
5 million people

I gave cocaine
to my baby?

Youâ€™re taking this
the wrong way.

Iâ€™m telling you how I feel.
I donâ€™t believe this!

Look, Phoebe, nobodyâ€™s
going to do this TV piece
unless you approve it.

I donâ€™t!

Phoebe, how do you
think things get done?

People step forward.

Yeah, when they decide to,

not when their mothers decide
itâ€™s political football!

Would you please
just give this a chance?

I know itâ€™s not easy,
but if youâ€™ll just try,

youâ€™ll see
how good you feel

knowing your story
is going to help
somebody else.

I canâ€™t think about
anybody else right now.

Donâ€™t be so selfish!
Selfish?

Where do you think
I learned that from,

miss back-on-the-job
six-days-later?

Listen to
what sheâ€™s saying.

Every time you trot
out that old story,

do you know
what Iâ€™m thinking?

I had your attention
for less than a week!

I couldnâ€™t compete
with the supreme court!

You had my love and
attention every day
of your life!

Oh, if I did, then when
did I start taking drugs,

if you were paying
so much attention?

I donâ€™t want...
My 12th birthday!

What?

You remember
that student assistant
dad hired that fall?

I came home from
school early one day,
and he was making dinner.

He was smoking a joint.
I cut a deal with him.

I said, "I wonâ€™t
bust you to daddy
if you let me try it."

He kept me in pot
the whole time
he lived with us.

Why didnâ€™t you
tell us?

Oh, come on, mother!
Why do you think?

I was getting
away with it,

and besides,
you werenâ€™t there!

So itâ€™s my fault you
started taking drugs?

Oh, Iâ€™m so sorry, mother.
No, itâ€™s my fault.

Does that make you happy?

Is that what
you want to hear?

My whole life
is my fault!

I mean, Iâ€™ve never accomplished
anything, anyway,

so Iâ€™ll just go on TV,
and Iâ€™ll say,

"hi, Iâ€™m Nell Harringtonâ€™s
daughter, the drug addict!"

How can you
do this to me?

Iâ€™m not doing
something to you.

Iâ€™m trying to do
something for you!

Well, then stop
doing things for me!

You canâ€™t make decisions
for me anymore.

This is my recovery!
Itâ€™s mine!

You canâ€™t even
let me have this
without taking over!

Iâ€™m not trying to take...
Well, you are, mother.

What, you want to come in here
with your cameras?

You want to ruin
whatâ€™s left of my life?

You want to turn Olivia
into a poster child?

Fine! You go ahead.
Do what you want.

Mrs. Harrington?

I have to put
phoebeâ€™s needs first.

Alden,
get me some studies

on family incomes
and college loans.

You got it.

I donâ€™t know
how such a dunce

got to be a member of
an education committee.

Nell?
Simon?

Simon. Wait a minute, Alden.
Whatâ€™s the matter?

Whatâ€™s the matter?
They called me at home.

Phoebeâ€™s dropped
out of the program.

She has got to come
back here. Thatâ€™s
all there is to it.

I hope she does,
but the program
is voluntary.

Residents are responsible
for their own actions.

All the ladies
tried to talk her
out of this.

It hurts everyone
when somebody leaves.

Now, there is
a 24-hour grace period

before we have to
relinquish her spot
to a new client,

and Phoebe
is aware of this.

But if she doesnâ€™t
check in,

we are legally bound
to report Oliviaâ€™s
status to the dcys.

If it were any
of our other clients,

sheâ€™d probably
lose custody,

but we all know
that the child welfare

is not going to
go after somebody with
phoebeâ€™s background...

If she doesnâ€™t
endanger her baby.

Iâ€™ll get her back here.
I know how to find her.

Phoebe used
your intervention
as a reason to drop out.

If sheâ€™s looking
for a reason to stay out,

youâ€™d be feeding
right into it.

But...then
what can I do?

Let her make
her own mistakes,
if she has to.

You canâ€™t
do this for her.

I donâ€™t have a daughter.

I just donâ€™t have
a daughter now.

Yes, well...

We canâ€™t just
leave her out there.

You heard
what that woman said.

The best thing
for Phoebe is not
to pressure her.

I have to do something.

No, Nell, you donâ€™t.
You have to do nothing,

for once in your life.

Iâ€™m just trying
to solve this.

Who gave you
this power?

Itâ€™s not
on your shoulders
to solve everything.

You just keep at it.

And now look
whatâ€™s happened.

Look what youâ€™ve done.

Whatever Iâ€™ve done,

Iâ€™ve done because
I love Phoebe.

She is my child.

I canâ€™t bear the idea of her
not being in my life.

You bear not having
me in your life?

â€™cause thatâ€™s where
weâ€™re heading.

I donâ€™t know, Nell.

Iâ€™ve been thinking
I might want to go
up to Cambridge

and work on my book,

take a place up there.

Well, you do
what you have to do.

Iâ€™ll try, frank,
but I really think

youâ€™re going to
have to get somebody else.

No, no, Iâ€™m fine.
Itâ€™s just...
Iâ€™m all right.

She just...
She hasnâ€™t gotten
a lot of sleep.

[Baby crying]

All right, all right.
Iâ€™ll be there.

You win. Ok.

And...arms out.

Slowly up to fifth.

Very pretty.

And...breathe deeply.

2...3...4...5...
6...7...8.

Thanks, Mrs. Harrington,

for getting family house
into the proposal.

When the bill passes,

itâ€™s going to help
both our programs.

Well, you both deserve it.

I wish youâ€™d consider
taking a seat on our
board of directors.

Oh, thank you,
but I think

this had better
just be between us.

Down to the left...

2...3...4...5...
6...7...again.

And 1...2...

Oh, this is brand-new.

Yeah.

Holly, weâ€™re out
of clean diapers.

When was she born?

The day
after Phoebe left.

Adena Milagros.

Have you heard
from Phoebe?

No. Oh.

Good luck with her.

4...5...6...
7...8...

And...1.

Great.

Have fun today.

Bye.

[Knock on door]

Mm-hmm. Come.

Simon? Iâ€™m going out.

Uh-huh.

Iâ€™m going to see
Phoebe.

Oh...i see.

You still thinking about
going up to Cambridge

to finish your book?

Um...i was...

I was actually thinking

of going up
to the lake house to work.

Itâ€™s quieter up there.

Hmm...

Thatâ€™s good.

Iâ€™ll be up in that
neck of the woods

when I start
my senate campaign,

so I guess Iâ€™ll
see you up there.

But I thought that
you werenâ€™t running.

Hell, yes, Iâ€™m running.

Oh.

Well, Iâ€™ll vote for you.

Good.

[Chatter and piano playing]

â™ª Love used to be â™ª

â™ª better every year â™ª

â™ª what a good love we had â™ª

â™ª tell me â™ª

â™ª how somethinâ€™ so good â™ª

â™ª could go bad â™ª

â™ª thereâ€™s nothinâ€™
we can do now â™ª

â™ª to put it
back together â™ª

â™ª just sit and watch it
walk out the door â™ª

â™ª good things grow â™ª

â™ª and love ainâ€™t growinâ€™
no more â™ª

â™ª good things grow â™ª

â™ª and love ainâ€™t growinâ€™ â™ª

â™ª no more â™ªâ™ª


Thank you, thank you.

Mom.

Phoebe.

Hi.

I didnâ€™t want you
to know I was here.

Sorry. I just wanted
to come and see you

and make sure
you were all right.

Phoebe, the last thing
in the world

I wanted to do
was drive you away.

How did you think
I was going to react?

I thought it would
give you something.

No.

Iâ€™m sorry.

Me, too.

Guess I wonâ€™t do anything
like that again.

You probably will.

Iâ€™ll work on it.
I will try.

You look good.

Sound good, too.

Mom.
Hmm?

Follow me, hmm?

Thank you.

Youâ€™re welcome.

Oh, look at this.

Look at you.

Sheâ€™s beginning to look
just like you and Charlie.

I know.

Hi, sweetie. Hello.

Mom...

Mom, I need to
tell you something.

I broke down yesterday.
I had my first drink.

It was nothing much.

It was just...

A small glass
of wine, but...

It felt good.
I got buzzed.

All of a sudden,
I couldnâ€™t remember

why I was supposed
to be straight.

I even started
thinking Iâ€™ll just
do one line.

And the first oneâ€™s
so fantastic.

But you didnâ€™t.
No...

Not this time, no.

Next time,
I would have.

Iâ€™m going to
check myself back
into family house

as soon as they have
a bed open.

Good...good for you.

I want to try
and end this.

I want to end it.

Yeah.

[Baby fusses]

Oh, honey.

Oh...oh, yes.

Come here.

Here we go.

Shh, shh, shh.

Itâ€™s all right.

Whoâ€™s that?

Hi.

Whoâ€™s that?
Hey, you.

What you looking?

Youâ€™re a good lady.

And so are you.
Yeah, you are.

Bye, sweetheart.

Phoeb...

If you need
a babysitter...

I got your number.

Right.
