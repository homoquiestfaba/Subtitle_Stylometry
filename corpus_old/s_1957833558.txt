win

such a life-changing sum of
money?

Oh, well, I feel helluvalot
better

than yesterday. (laughs)

I understand that you had a
little help

picking the winner number.

I picked the same ones I
always do.

And that was your son's
birthday?

Yeah, James, my son James.

You wanna meet him?

[Newsman] Sure.
Okay, James!

And what do you plan to do

with 190,000 smackeroos?

God, I don't know, maybe buy a
house,

and buy something nice for my
boy.

Just have a better life!

[Woman] Hey, Lee, what about

[Manager] Leslie, I

(manager knocks)

(dog barks)

No one pays on time,
but Leslie's gotta go?

Leslie's gotta go.

Where am I gonna go?

Where am I gonna take all this
stuff?

No one pays on time!

Frank?

Hey, can you help me?

Frank, just for a month.

Just for a month, Frank.

Hey, Frank!

Zach, come here.

Zach! Come Zach, you
motherfucker!

Hey, one night, one night, just

I'm sorry I couldn't keep
helping you.

You're gonna put me on the
street?

You're gonna put me on the
fucking street?

Open the door, open the fucking
door!

Motherfucker!

Now, I'll be taking my things.

And saying, fuck you!

(loud music)

â™ª I'm going down â™ª

â™ª I'm going down, down, down,
down, down â™ª

â™ª Yes, I'm going down, yes â™ª

â™ª I'm going down, down, down,

â™ª And sleep on sister Irene's
floor â™ª

(thunder roaring)

(bus engine idling)

Mom.

(Leslie laughs)

Hey.
Hey, baby.

(car engine revving)

I get coffee there sometimes.

I did some painting for them.

They do a mean ribs.

You like living here?

Yeah, sure.

Big city, plenty of stuff going
on.

And where do you stay?

I thought we take the long
way.

Let you see where I'm living.

I'm right around the corner.

It's here.

(keys jingling)

Yo, yo, yo!

Oh hey, bud, how's it going?

[Will] Good, this your moms?
Alright.

Yeah, this is my mom, Leslie.

Mom, that's Will and
Chris, they're next door.

Pleased to know you.
Nice to meet you.

So this is it.

Um, you can sleep in my room.

That one's Darren's.

Oh God, no, I can sleep
on the couch just fine.

No, that's okay.

You wanna tell me what's going
on?

Oh, can't we...

Can I hear about you first

before we start going into my
shit?

Sure.

You wanna go somewhere or
something?

Wanna go out?

Um...

I'm kinda beat, I came
straight from work to get you.

Okay, well, maybe tomorrow we
can go.

Yeah, yeah, I'll call in sick.

No, you don't have to
do that for me. (laughs)

They won't mind.

Are you hungry?

You want some Chinese?

I could eat.

You still like wonton soup?

Mm-hmm.

Okay, I'll run to the corner.

You good?

Yeah, I'm fine, baby.

(keys jingle)
(door opens)

(door closes)

(Leslie groans)

(pop music)

I don't know, she hasn't
told me anything yet.

I can't smell it on her.

I won't lie, she doesn't look
good.

Yeah, I gotta go.

Grandma, she's not gonna hurt
me.

I gotta go, I love you too.

Okay, bye.

Did you find something you like?

Yeah, work is steady.

Pays decent enough most of the
time.

Darren's there too.

You like that kinda work?

Yeah, I like being outside.

I'm good at it.

It's funny,

I always thought you'd be a rock
star.

Since when?

Well, since I bought you that
guitar.

You still play it?

Not so much anymore.

How about these?

No, I'll get this, I'll get
this.

It's fine.

I don't need my son buying me
underwear.

God, it's always such a mess in
here!

God.

(soft music)

(cash register whirring)

Did you call your grandma?

Yeah.

I knew you would.

I told her we were having a
nice day, that you were good!

Did she tell you you're a
liar?

(James laughs)

So what's your plan?

I don't know, I'll
spend some time with you.

Why? You want me to get
out of here already?

What about going home?

To mom and dad? Are
you out of your mind?

No, home.

Oh, to Dutch and Nancy.

No, they're the reason I am the
way I am.

No.

Hey, you wanna go to the zoo?

The zoo? Those places are
terrible.

I used to take you all time.

Animals are meant to be in the
wild

and we put them in cages.

How'd you like it if people
stood around

watching you suffer?

They do.

Then don't go to zoos.

(James scoffs)
(Leslie grunting)

Mom! I'm so sorry.

Stop! (laughs)

What are you doing?

You on one of them dating
apps?

Picking out girls like
youse fishing with dynamite?

I don't have time for that.

[Leslie] Don't have time to
have fun?

I'm working, trying to put
back.

Ah, you're trying to
do what I didn't do.

Well, I'm glad I taught you
something.

Before I leave, I wanna
go over some ground rules.

Oh, okay.

You can stay here as long
as you need to make a plan.

Long as you need.

But you can't live here.

You need a plan.

Okay.

And no drinking.

Baby, I don't drink no more.

[James] We can smoke
pot, that's fine, but-

Baby, I don't drink like I
used to.

Okay, see you tomorrow?

Good night.

(birds chirping)

I'll be home around 6:00.

Just, we can take a walk or
something.

I'll be just fine.

Okay.

(door opens)
(door closes)

(Leslie gasps)

How's it going?

Hi! I'm Leslie, I'm James's
mama.

[Will] Oh, I remember.

Heading out for the day?

Well, yeah, he needs some
milk.

Oh, little Jimmy needs
milk for his cereal?

Well, have a good one!

(upbeat music)

Thank you, ma'am.

â™ª I've been down to Mississippi
â™ª

No, no, no, no!

Not in here, not in here!

Take that outside!

No, no, no, get out!

â™ª I played in California â™ª

â™ª There ain't too much I haven't
seen â™ª

â™ª No there ain't â™ª

â™ª Lord, I'm a ramblin' man â™ª

â™ª Don't fool around with a
ramblin' man. â™ª

Oh, thank you, honey.

Man, my mama whoop me good

if I passed her a joint.

(James and Leslie laugh)

Where's your mama, Darren?

She passed away.

[Leslie] I'm sorry.

Yeah, life sucks.

(James laughs)

Don't you laugh at him, he's
sad.

You like to be around James?

[Leslie] Oh, I love it.

When's the last time
you all saw each other?

It must been six years.

[Darren] Damn, six years? How
come?

Hey, will you mind
your own business? Jesus.

He's fine.

He don't need me riding him
the way my mama rode me.

That's James's grandma?

What's she like?

Baptist.

(laughs) She said, "Baptist."

(all laugh)

You two are funny.

I mean, what's wrong with
going to Dutch and Nancy's?

Those people are evil.

They're fine.

You don't know 'em like I do.

You don't know 'em like I do.

Are you good in here?

What?

I'm just stoned, is all.

Night night, sweetie.

Good night.

(Leslie groans)

(machine whirring)

(door opens)
(door closes)

Mom?

Motherfucker.

(door bangs)
(loud music)

(James knocks)

Hey, you seen my mom?

No, everything okay?

Chris? Nothing?

No.

Everything alright?

Just call me if you do.

(door closes)
(car horn honks)

(group cheering)

(man faintly speaking)

[Group] Yeah.

[Man] That's right, okay.

Now, (faintly speaking).

(footsteps pattering)

Where have you been?

(door shuts)

Well, you're home early!

I've been all over town
looking for you.

I was here, baby, watching TV.

Mom?!

I was here and I went for a
walk

'cause I've been cooped up in
here.

So I went looking for a job.

[James] A job?
Yeah.

Gonna get my plan - you
know, figure out my plan.

Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

Honey, are you okay?

What kind of job?

What kind?



Were you next door?

(Leslie scoffs)

Jesus fucking Christ!

Baby, baby, baby!

Baby? Oh!

(James knocks)

[James] Was she in here-

[Will] Hey, man, look-
When I was talking to you?

[Will] We was just having a
beer.

You were having a beer with my
mother?

[Will] I didn't know that was
a problem.

[James] No? Then why'd you lie
about it?

[Will] Because she
freaked when she heard you.

Okay, I don't know what's
going on between you two-

Don't talk to her again!
Don't talk to her again!

Dude, you need to calm down!

Oh, come on!
Come on, come on!




Baby? Baby, baby.

Baby, please, I went out.

I was just trying to have
some fun, 'cause it's-

You stole money from Darren.

What?

You stole money from Darren.

I didn't steal.

Did he tell you that?

Come on, lie to me
again. Lie to me again!

I'm your mother, I would
not steal money from you.

What are you doing?

Get off of me. (groans)

Un-fucking-believable!

You fucking chicken shit!

Hey! Baby?

Hey, hey.

What did I say?! No drinking!

(bottle clatters)

I'm your mother, you cannot
talk to me this way, James.

Mother? Mother?!

Yes, your momma

stop it.
You're a drunk!

I am sick.

I'm not gonna do this again,
I'm not.

You? What about me?

We were supposed to have a good
life.

I didn't want this for you.

I had a good life until you
showed up.

I'm not even 20.

I can't even drink yet,

and I have to take care of my
mother?

I have to take care of you?

I made one rule, no drinking,

and you couldn't last a fucking
day!

I'm sad.

I can't help it.

But I wanna be a good momma.

I wanna be a good momma again.

Baby, I wanna be a good momma, I
do.

I love you so much, baby.

Who are you calling?

Are you calling grandma?

You do not call my mother!

She is my mother!

You do not call my mother!

You leave her out of this!

(car engine revs)

What are you doing? Why are they
here?

Taking you to the bus station.

No baby.

I will not go out again, baby.

I called Dutch.

Dutch?

He's gonna pick you
up when you get to town.

Baby don't make me go back
there.

No, no.

You're just like your grandma!

Baby

I love you so much.

I love you so much.

Don't do this to me.

I hope that fills your cup.

(door opens)
(door shuts)

(soft music)

(birds chirping)

(soft music continues)

(bus engine revving)

(car horn honks)

Hi.

(car door shuts)

(car engine revving)

(birds chirping)

(car door shuts)

(footsteps pattering)

Yeah, it's just putting money
down on two different places

and never got that back.

My car got fucking stolen
and shit just piled up.

All that time, you weren't
working?

I was.

Well, how are you doing, Nance?

Alright.

James told us what happened.

Stop!

Go on, go ahead.

Go ahead.

Help yourself.

You always do.

The only reason we agreed
to put you up is that boy,

and what you did for us.

Don't you give her that!

Do you want to do this?

We put a helluva lot more to
this place

than what she gave us.

The only reason you're here

is James.

But there will be none of
that shit you pulled on him.

This is my house, you
will follow my rules.

Dutch, don't talk like that.

I ain't fucking around,
Lee, I'll put you on the curb!

Dutch, it's me.

What y'all doing tonight?

We're having a fire.

Would you do me favor

and you just don't tell anyone
I'm here?

Nance already did.

You're welcome to join, but
you will be painting tomorrow,

so you might wanna think
about getting some rest.

I'm painting?

Yeah, yeah, to start with.

This ain't a charity, Lee.

We ain't them derelicts you spit
on,

and we ain't partying no more.

We work, when we come
home, we work some more.

So don't expect a repeat.

Ain't no one taking your shit
a second time, you got it?

Is that you talking or
is that Nancy talking?

(laughs) You know where the
door is.

Are you fucking kidding me?

No.
Man, she was a fish.

(indistinct) Yeah.
You remember that?

Yeah.
She could drink

all of ya'll under the table.

(group laughs)

[Man] Hell yeah.

(Nancy laughs)

She just blew all that money?

Yeah.
Yeah. (laughs)

Yeah.

Where's she been?

Well, why don't we ask her?

Yeah.

[Group] Go.

Leslie?
No, don't (indistinct).

Pete, no, don't you call her
out!

(speakers faintly speaking)

Leslie?

Leslie?

Leslie

I know you're in there

That was breakfast.

(bushes rattling)
(chain jingling)

(can crackling)
(bushes rattling)

(car door shuts)
(car engine revving)

(crickets chirping)

(speakers faintly speaking)

Oh my God, lower your fucking
voice!

I don't care.

She fucking hears that.

I can give two fucking shits!

I hope she fucking does!

What do you want! You want
me to knock her around for you?

Pop her in the mouth?

No, I want her out of my
fucking house!

Who's fucking stopping you!

You're the one who let her in
here!

He called me crying, he
was begging on the phone.

What the fuck was I supposed to
do

I will not be played
for a fool, not again.

No, I will not! Don't you
walk away from me, Dutch!

Dutch, get back here you fucking
asshole.

(crickets chirping)

â™ª I don't need your rockin'
chair â™ª

â™ª Your Geritol or your Medicare
â™ª

â™ª Well, I still got Neon in my
veins â™ª

â™ª This grey hair don't mean a
thing â™ª

â™ª I do my rockin' on the stage â™ª

â™ª You can't put this possum in a
cage â™ª

â™ª My body's old but it ain't
impaired â™ª

You can set me up.

â™ª I don't need your rockin'
chair â™ª

â™ª I ain't ready for the junkyard
yet â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I still feel
like a new corvette â™ª

â™ª It might take a little
longer but I'll get there â™ª

Thank you.

â™ª Well, I don't need your
rockin' chair â™ª

â™ª I don't need your rockin'
chair â™ª

â™ª Your Geritol or your Medicare
â™ª

â™ª I still got Neon â™ª

â™ª Along the coach roads I did
ride â™ª

â™ª With sword and pistol by my
side â™ª

â™ª Many a young maid lost
her baubles to my trade â™ª

â™ª Many a soldier shed his
life blood on my blade â™ª

â™ª The bastards hung me
in the spring of '25 â™ª

â™ª But I am still alive â™ª

â™ª I was a sailor, I was
born upon the tide â™ª

â™ª And with the sea I did abide â™ª

â™ª I sailed a schooner
'round the horn to Mexico â™ª

â™ª I went aloft to furl
the mainsail in a blow â™ª

Howdy. Howdy!

Yeah.

â™ª And when the yards broke off,
â™ª

â™ª they said that I got killed â™ª

â™ª But I am living still â™ª

I think that one was mine.

(laughs) I think you might be
right.

â™ª Across the river deep and wide
â™ª

Gotcha.

Oh, you did.

Yeah.

So where are you boys from?

Are you cowboying for Samson?

We're in from Jacksonville.

Just passing through, that's
nice.

Just passing through.

Just passing through.

And what do you think of our
little piece of paradise here?

It's a fine town.

(chuckles) Well, I was born
here

and I can tell you it ain't
fine. (laughs)

Is that so?

Yeah, but I did win the
lottery here.

Yeah, right here in this bar.

Did you?

That's pretty lucky.

Yep, they used to have
my picture above the bar,

but I can't see it no more.

Mister? Hey, mister?

picture?

We don't serve pitchers,
just glass or bottle.

(laughs)

Where's my picture?

My face

I won the lottery.

I was the one who won the
lottery.

Obe used to have it up there.

Yeah, I don't know.

I bought it from Obe.

What? And you just took it
down?

I'm sure you have plenty
of photographs of that day.

Well, thank you, thank you.

(upbeat music)

Oh,

sweet Waylon.

Do you wanna dance with me?

Come on. Come on.

Come on, let's dance.

â™ª Lord, it's the same old tune â™ª

Come on, you wanna dance.

â™ª Fiddle and guitar â™ª

Oh, no.

Get up!
I insist.

Have I gotta drag you by the
hand...?

â™ª Rhinestone suits and new shiny
cars â™ª

Oh, yeah, whoa! Whoa!

â™ª The same way for years â™ª

â™ª We need a change â™ª

(Leslie laughs)

â™ª Somebody told me, when
I came to Nashville â™ª

â™ª Son, you finally got it made â™ª

You got some moves.

Yeah, I used to come here
every night.

Had all the boys lining up.

â™ª But I don't think
Hank done it this way â™ª

â™ª Take it home â™ª

(upbeat music)

Thanks for the dance, miss.

No, you can stay.

Come on, you can stay and buy me
a drink.

Have a good night and be well.

â™ª Speedin' my young life away â™ª

â™ª Tell me one more time
just so's I'll understand â™ª

â™ª Are you sure Hank done it this
way â™ª

â™ª Did old Hank really do it this
way â™ª

(upbeat music)

Hey.

â™ª Lord, I've seen the world,
with a five piece band â™ª

â™ª Looking at the back side of me
â™ª

â™ª Singing my songs and
one of his now and then â™ª

â™ª But I don't think
Hank done 'em this way â™ª

â™ª I don't think Hank done it
this way â™ª

What're you standing around
looking at?

â™ª Take it home â™ª

(upbeat music)

Boring.

Boring.

Wah! (laughs)

(upbeat music)

Hey, Nance, guess who I saw?

(crickets chirping)

(Leslie sneezes)

You motherfuckers!

(Leslie banging)

You fucking monsters!

(soft music)

(car engine revving)

Fuck you, Nancy!

(metal clinking)

Alright, come on!

I see you over there.

Rise and shine!

(metal clinking)

Let's go.

Get up and get off the property,
come on.

(metal clinking)

Let's go!

(metal clinking)

This ain't no place to sleep.

That's it.

(door opens)

Hey man, I found this.

Oh, yeah?

I don't know.

(door shuts)

What am I gonna do with that?

I don't know, go through
it and see what you find

and junk the rest, I guess.

Lost and found now? Okay.

Whoa!
Jesus, Royal.

(Royal laughs)

Come on, man.

I heard she was back.

Do I know her?

She came before you left --

I mean, she left for you came.

Real sad story, real sad.

(train chugging)

(Leslie cries)

(car engine revving)

Well heya, Lee.

Waiting for someone?

You looking for a drink?

(soft rock music)

Beer and burgers, I get,
but vodka and French fries?

Shit, how's that taste?

(Leslie murmurs)

Yeah, I remember when
I went tits up for you.

Everyone cozying up, all that
money.

But you ain't without fault.

I ain't saying nothing you don't
know.

I'm on disability now, that's
new.

You look fine to me.

I look fine?

I mean, not broken.

Mm-hmm

Hey, what are you doing, Pete?

What are you doing?

(Leslie groans)
Ow. Ow!


(Leslie grunts)

(door closes)

(crickets chirping)

(Leslie groans)

(car engine revving)

Oh, shit, man.

That lady's back looking for her
bag.

You bring it out there, she
gonna know you went through it.

Better let her be, man.

Just let her be.

Shit.

Hey, hey, lady.

What?

You're just not gonna quit,
are ya?

The reason I'm not returning
your calls is because-

What?

Shit.

I didn't steal nothing.

I know. I know.

I got your calls.

I didn't return them,

but the job is yours if
you want it, alright?

Pays 10 an hour.

You know what? Make it seven.

Seven an hour, room and board.

The job is yours if you want it,
okay?

It's easy work, $7 an hour.

All you got to do is
maintain the property,

run some errands, room and
board.

Did you wanna say something?

You're offering me a job?

Yeah, the one you've been
calling about.

I was calling?

I thought so.

Okay.

Okay. Shit.

Why do you keep cussing?

Just meet me over at
the office in an hour

and I'll get you set up.

Did you just offer her a job?

I don't know what's wrong with
me, man.

Look, you better go back
out there and tell her no.

[Sweeney] You go tell her!

Dammit, Sweeney!
Where's she gonna sleep?

[Sweeney] In my room.

Where are you gonna sleep?

[Sweeney] In your room?

And where am I fitting to
sleep?

Right in here.

Now, you got your basic cable.

You got Wi-Fi, most days you got
Wi-Fi.

I think this is yours.

Oh, I'm sorry, it is mine,
yeah.

Oh. (laughs).

So what have I got to do for all
this?

Oh, well, nothing! I mean-

I gotta work, don't I?

Oh, right, yeah.

Yeah, you gotta work.

Basically, you got to clean up
the rooms

after the guests leave and wash
the towels, wash the sheets,

maintain the property a little
bit

and help guests with their bags.

That it?

That is it, really,
pretty much it, right.

Okay.

[Sweeney] And nothing
tonight, we'll start tomorrow.

Okay! (laughs)

Okay.

Royal, the other one of us,

we're about to have supper,

if you wanna join us,
you're more than welcome.

Thank you.

I think I'm gonna settle in.

Right, of course, I'll leave
you to it.

Alright. Hey?

Yeah.
(Leslie clears throat)

When do I get paid?

(laughs) Right, of course,
that's pretty important.

End of the week.

But if you needed an
advance, I could probably...

It would help.

Right, okay.

Not a problem.

How's 50? Is that...

No, God.

Thank you!

Okay, alright. So, great.

Well, good night then.

Good night, I'll see you
tomorrow.

Yes, you will, you will.

Sleep well. Yeah, good night.

(door closes)

(Leslie sighs)

(Leslie snores)
(birds chirping)

Damn clock didn't go off.

Hey, look, it's okay.

You didn't know, I didn't tell
you,

but we start at 8:00 AM around
here.

Good to know.

Alright. You know what?

Let me get you a key so you
can get into the other rooms.

Oh, come on, come on.

Thank you.
Why don't you take that.

Thank you.

Hi, Royal! You remember me?

(sniffles)

I do.

How you doing?

Okay.

Well, I'll get to it.

Okay.
Bye.

If you need anything, let me
know.

Sure.

(Sweeney sighs)

Hey, Royal, you seen a
pink suitcase about so big?

(car engine revving)

(door closes)
Hey, she'll get

the hang of it, man.

Cleaning the room.

Real mountain to climb.

(car engine revs)

(soft music)
(washing machine whirring)

A good way is to use your
finger, okay?

And if there's guck on it,
then you need to do it again.

I mean, I don't wanna

be a hard-ass, Leslie-
No.

But clean is clean.

Yeah, yeah,

I guess I'm just getting used to

how things work around here.

Yeah, we do it right
the first time around.

Okay, yes, sir.

Okay, alright then.

Well, good night.

Hey, hey, hey, can I...

Could I have the other
half of that advance

that you gave me?

'Cause I spent the first
half on groceries, and I

was thinking it'd be so nice

to have some flowers for the
room.

Uh huh.

There you go.

(Leslie chuckles)

(engine revving)

[Leslie] Thank you.

Alright.

(crickets chirping)
(car engine revving)

(Nancy laughs)

Where's Dutch, Nance?

What, you got the balls to

throw me out you fucking house,

but you can't look at me?

Little girl, you need to look
around.

Little girl?

You fucking wish.

You don't gotta worry about me

because despite your best
effort, I ain't going nowhere.

I got me a job.

I got a place to stay,
so you better watch out.

Bang, bang.

Y'all remember, Leslie, don't
you?

Helen and Raymond's little girl?

That's right, our lucky lotto
winner!

You remember the Brickmans?

Mr. and Mrs. Brickman and Warren
Parnell.

He used to play Sunday Oregon.

I'm sure they'd love to hear
what's going on in your life.

Why don't you pull up a seat?

How are you?

You disappeared on us.

Me? I'm fine.

And your folks? I do miss
them.

Yeah, they're well.

They're down in Florida.

Next time you speak to 'em,
tell 'em I'm thinking of 'em.

Oh, I will.

You know, Leslie,

we still pray for you.

No matter what's been done,

the church is still here for
you.

I hope you know that.

Well, sorry for the
interruption.

And I hope you all have a
good night and God bless.

And ya know,

I'm just gonna be over
here enjoying myself,

if you get tired of ole saddle
bags here.

See you around, Lee.

Yeah, you will.

I apologize.

That's what my mama would call
rode hard and hung up wet.

â™ª I try to write some happy
songs â™ª

(car engine revving)

Morning. God, damn
alarm didn't go off again.

Royal, will you tell him
my alarm didn't go off?

I can't do nothing about that.

(car engine starting)

Some people can't see a good
thing

when it's dropped on their
plate. (laughs)

(train chugging)

(birds chirping)

(car engine revving)

(crickets chirping)

(car door closes)

Everything go okay?

I dare you to find dirt.

(car engine revving)

Alright, derelicts, chug
it or fuck it -- last call.

â™ª Look around you â™ª

â™ª Look down the bar from you â™ª

â™ª At the faces that you see â™ª

â™ª Are you sure that this
is where you want to be? â™ª

Is that a joke?

â™ª These are your friends â™ª

â™ª But are they real friends? â™ª

â™ª Do they love you as much as
me? â™ª

â™ª Are you sure that this
is where you want to be? â™ª

(Leslie laughs)

â™ª You seem in such a hurry â™ª

â™ª to lead this kind of life â™ª

â™ª And you've caused so
many pain and misery â™ª

â™ª But look around you, take a
good look â™ª

â™ª Just between you and me â™ª

â™ª Are you sure that this
is where you want to be? â™ª

â™ª Please don't let my tears
persuade you â™ª

â™ª I had hoped I wouldn't cry â™ª

â™ª But lately, teardrops
seem a part of me â™ª

â™ª But look around you, take a
good look â™ª

â™ª At all the local used-to-be's
â™ª

â™ª Are you sure that this
is where you want to be â™ª

(footsteps pattering)

(crunching gravel)
(crickets chirping)

(Leslie knocks)

(door opens)

Hey, buddy.

What are you doing up and out of
bed?

(both laugh)

I used to live here.

(kid laughs)

Yeah

(Leslie laughs)

Can I help you?

(Leslie laughs)

Do I need to walk you out?

No, no.

God, this was a good house.

I used to cook and clean.

I used to cook and clean

And Christmas, we used to have
a just wonderful Christmas.

We used to put the tree
there in that corner.

Is that where you put your tree?

Is there somebody that
you need me to call?

No.

Ma'am, is there somebody
that you need me to call?

(car engine revving)

(car door opens)

(car door closes)

(door opens)

(soft music)

(door closes)

(soft music continues)

(Leslie sighs)

(Leslie cries)

(keys jingling)

(door closes)

(Leslie sniffs)

(Leslie coughs)

(birds chirping)
(Sweeney knocks)

Hey, Leslie.

Listen, I'm sorry it didn't work
out.

(Sweeney knocks)

You can just take what I gave
you for the time you put in.

(Sweeney knocks)

Leslie?

I don't think she in there.

(Sweeney knocks)
(Sweeney sighs)

(door closes)

Hey, Leslie, I need to talk to
you.

Come on.

(Sweeney sighs)

I'm sorry.

I haven't been myself late-.

for a long time

And this is a good job, I
understand that.

And I messed up, I'm sorry.

If you got people,
I can take you to 'em.

If I had,

I'da called 'em last night.

I might look stupid to you
but-

You don't.

Yeah, well, I ain't one for
letting people get over on me.

You could've fooled me there.

Look, it might not be obvious to
you,

but I'm asking to stay.

When you finish that,
go check in with Royal.

There's some crap behind
16, he needs help sorting.

(cup clanks)
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

(door closes)

(vacuum cleaner whirring)
(door closes)

(Leslie vomits)
(Leslie coughs)

(water running)

(crickets chirping)

(Royal howls)
(Sweeney chuckles)

Royal. We like to keep him
around.

Something for the kids to
poke a stick at. (laughs)

How long you been drinking?

Okay, mind my business?

Sure thing.

Royal, that's not even the
weirdest thing he does.

You'll see in time.

You'll see for yourself.

He'll get butt-naked and run
that field

just screaming like a damn wild
man.


He'll just go, just running
naked, crazy!

You wait till you'll see it.

Oh, man, the cops don't even
bother with him anymore.

He does it so damn much.

Crazy son of a bitch.

You know...

quitting cold turkey, it's a
good way to shock your system.

Well, I don't got a choice.

Someone making you quit?

(Royal howls)

Alright, well, you don't
seem like you wanna talk

and that's okay,
(Royal howls)

but we're trying to eat dinner
here

and I don't wanna listen to
that.

So is there some music
you'd like me to put on?

You can pick.

Okay, why don't we just play

whatever Royal's got on there?

Just let ol'

D.J. Royal spin it

(soft music)

â™ª Hare Krshna, Hare Krshna â™ª

(both laugh)

What is that?

Oh, man, he's out of his mind.

â™ª Hare Rama, Hare Rama â™ª

It's not bad, though, it's not
bad.

â™ª Rama Rama, Hare Hare â™ª

â™ª Hare Krshna, Hare Krshna â™ª

â™ª Krshna Krshna, Hare Hare â™ª

(Sweeney laughs)

â™ª Hare Rama, Hare Rama â™ª

â™ª Rama Rama, Hare Hare â™ª

â™ª Hare Krshna, Hare Krshna â™ª

â™ª Krshna Krshna â™ª
(Leslie groans)

â™ª Hare Hare â™ª

â™ª Hare Rama, Hare Rama â™ª

â™ª Rama Rama, Hare Hare â™ª

â™ª Hare Krshna, Hare Krshna â™ª

â™ª Krshna Krshna Hare Hare â™ª

â™ª Hare Rama â™ª
Hey.

(door closes)
â™ª Hare Rama â™ª

Should I be doing something?

â™ª Rama Rama â™ª

[Leslie] You make sure I don't
leave!

â™ª Hare Krshna, Hare Krshna â™ª

(Leslie vomiting)

â™ª Krishna Krshna, Hare Hare â™ª

â™ª Hare Rama, Hare Rama â™ª

â™ª Rama Rama, Hare Hare â™ª

â™ª Hare Krshna, Hare Krshna â™ª

(Sweeney knocks)

[Sweeney] Hey, do you need
anything?

I can bring you something to
eat.

Something to throw up.

(Leslie groans)

I'll give you time,

but three and four need to be
turned

and the sheets need folding.

Can't you give me a fucking
break?

[Sweeney] Hey, don't be
yelling at me.

Three and four.

Three and four.

(Leslie sighs)

Oh, alright, alright, alright.

(door closes)

I folded all them sheets.

I'm a one man parade.

(laughs) What is that?

I got Salisbury steak
with mashed potatoes

and roast turkey breast and
stuffing.

What would you like to eat?

I'll have a Salisbury steak.

[Sweeney] Yes, ma'am. How
would you like that cooked?

How about just hot?

(oven beeps)

Thank you.
(oven whirring)

So did you want me to stay
here again?

Okay.

Did you eat something?

I did, thank you.

Ya know?

I think you'd better leave.

Oh, come on, I been
hearing you all week.

It's the other end.

Oh, geez, alright.

Well, if you need anything, let
me know.

Yeah.

Okay.

(door shuts)

(quiet movie playing)

(Sweeney knocks)

Go away or I'll call the
police.

How's your tummy?

You know, I don't really
wanna talk about that with you.

But thank you for the pills.

That was Royal's idea.

Well, I'll thank him tomorrow.

Couldn't sleep, huh?

Nope, and I wanted to tell you

that you're doing good work.

The place looks real clean
and the guests are real happy.

Thank the Lord, I did it. I'm
a maid.

(Sweeney laughs)

Yeah, so when Royal's daddy
died

and left him the place, I
was already staying here.

So he asked me if I would help
him run it.

Wait, this is Royal's motel?

It is.

Didn't you grow up together?

Damn, we ain't run in the same
circles.

Well, that's probably better
off,

'cause somehow he did so much
LSD

that it permanently rewired his
brain.

(Leslie laughs)
I'm serious.

I mean, he can function, but
man,

you ask him to remember to pay a
bill?

So, I get a room and a small
wage.

And what'd you do before this?

I never did much.

I worked the oil field and got
divorced.

So run a motel?

Sure, I'll do it.

And that picture you
keep, is that your ex-wife?

No, that is my daughter,
Bernice and her baby.

(Leslie chuckles)

Did you leave them?

No, I left my wife.

I see them as much as possible.

They live about an hour away
from here.

Just didn't work out, huh?

Well, she drank.

And she beat the drinking.

And the church that helped
her, I did not care for.

And she liked the church
and like the pastor more.

No (chuckles).
Yes (chuckles).

Preacher stole my wife.

That's a gold record right
there.

You think Willie would sing
it?

I think he sang about it.

(laughs) Yeah, I think he did.

And your girl?

A good kid.

Had troubles with men, like
y'all do,

but she turned out good, though.

Hey, I didn't mean nothing

by saying her drinking led to
our divorce.

It did, but she ain't you

and things don't go the
same way for any two people.

And I don't think any less of
you

for having the problems you do.

So, hey, I wanted to ask you

if you wanted to join
me and Royal at a dance.

Now you don't wanna ask me no
more?

No, I am, I'm asking
you, but it's a town thing.

It's-
A town thing?

Yeah, right.

Meaning, everyone will be there.

The whole town and...

Oh,

Yeah, no thank you.

I'm just saying that it's your
home too.

And if you're planning on doing
something

other than eating TV dinners
with me and the space cadet,

maybe you oughta venture out a
bit.

That's all I'm thinking.

(country music)

(people cheering)
(food sizzling)

(country music)

Paw-paw!

Oh, who's that yelling at me?

Hey, Betsey-girl, how you doing?

Mom said we can play games.

Oh, she did, did she?

(laughs) Hey, dad.

Hey, how you doing? Is your
mom coming?

No, it's Sunday.

Lord forbid she have some
fun with her granddaughter.

That's okay, more for me!

(laughs) I told Betsey
you'd play games with her.

Where are you going?

Nowhere.

Well, good.

Hey Bernice, this is Leslie.

Royal hired her on at the hotel,
to host.

Leslie, this is my daughter,
Bernice,

and this little dream
here, this is Betsey.

Hi.
Hi! (laughs)

Well, pleasure to know you both.

It's nice to meet you.

Wanna get cracking?

Yeah.
Alright, let's go.

(upbeat music)

Are you from around here?

Yep, born and raised. (laughs)

And what about you?

We're just outside of Abilene.

Ah, yeah, it's nice.

Not too bad.

Yeah, I'm winning.

I'm winning.

I'm winning.

Oh, no.

(upbeat music)

[Kid] Oh, yeah.

Man.

It's nice.
Your girls are great.

I did alright, huh?

Yes, you did.

(Leslie cheers)

You cheated.
Yeah, they are cheaters.

Hey, I didn't cheat.
Come on.

Come on.
Come on.

Let's go to the next game.

What is this?

Hey, Betsey, look what Leslie
got ya.

Can you catch?

Yeah.
Can you catch?

[Bernice And Leslie] Oh!

What was that?

Shit!
What was that?

(Leslie laughs)

Here you go.
Thanks there, Dutch.

Sweeney, how are ya?

Just hanging out with my
girls. And you?

Can't complain.

Lee.

Hey, Dutch.

(upbeat music)

â™ª I was drivin' through
Georgia in late July â™ª

â™ª On a day hot enough
to make the devil sigh â™ª

â™ª I saw a homemade sign writtin'
in red â™ª

â™ª Rhine County Watermelon
Festival ahead â™ª

(country music)

The shovels of shit
her mama made him eat

just to be there for his kid.

He deserves a medal, huh?

Men ain't what they was.

My daddy worked whole
life to give us a roof.

He had eight fingers.

(Leslie laughs)

Well, mine had 10, but he
worked.

Now everyone thinks
they should be living

some life out the movies.

Life is hard, stop acting like
it ain't.

Just do what you gotta
and don't hurt no one.

(upbeat music)

What do you think about the moon
landing?

What?

We only went there one time.

(laughs) Hey.

You wanna take a picture,
it'll lasts longer.

Is it true you won the
lottery?

Yes, I did.

What did you do with all the
money?

I bought a pettin' zoo.

I heard you put it up your
nose.

Is it true you won the
lottery?

Someone tell you to come say
that?

Get outta here.

Before I tell your mama what
you're doing.

Pete's girl.

Yeah?

Hey, you wanna dance?

I think I'm gonna go.

But thank you for a nice day.

Wait, we just got here.

Did something happen?

â™ª Saw your picture in the paper
â™ª
Pete's been teasing her

Hey, mind your business.

Come on, who cares.

Let's dance.

(scoffs) Well, I do like this
song.

That's it.

â™ª All the things I never could â™ª

I know what you think about
it.

â™ª But I know that he can't give
you â™ª

â™ª What you need most of all â™ª

â™ª So the door is always open â™ª

It's not so bad, right?

What? Dancing with you?

We ain't done it long enough
for me to form an opinion.

Whoa! (laughs)

Don't worry about me.

Alright.

I'm talking about being out.

Yeah, I suppose I'll survive.

(people laughing)

(people cheering)

I won ya'll!

(people cheering)

I just won.

I won!

(crowd cheering)

[Nancy] What you gonna
do with all that money?

I'ma drink my ass off with
half of it

and wipe my ass with the other!

(people laughing)

[Man] What about your kids?

[Pete] Kids? I got drinks to
drink!

Come on, I'll come
with you. (Pete cheers)

That's good, Pete.


This bitch is clapping!

Yeah, I don't know what
you're talking about, Les.

See, I just won the lottery.

Not everything's about you.

You did? What you
gonna do with the money?

I'll figure something, don't
you worry.

I just wanna make
sure you don't waste it

like you wasted your goddamn
life.

Oh, you got jokes, huh?

You blew 180,000, you dumb
bitch.

190, and it ain't that much.

And what about you, Pete?

When I first met you, you were
fucking 18.

You were ready to see the world.

Look at you now.

You could've did anything,
Pete, but you fucking did this.

So don't give me your shit.

Hey, hey, why don't we all
just go back

to having a good time?

Huh? Come on.

You know what she did,
Sweeney?

It's not my business,

it's not yours to be doing this
here.

I mean, have some sense,
alright?

I mean, we're having fun.

You oughta know if you're
gonna be laying down with her.

Where's Dutch?

Someone needs to take her home.

You know she left her kid?

He don't know anything.
Hey.

Hey, hey, hey, no, no,
don't get mad at Royal.

He's just trying to help you
out.

Did she tell you she
drank all that money away?

Had every chance, pissed
it down the gutter,

and her son-
Nancy.

Left him, no note, nothing.

That boy was 13.

Ain't have food, he's just
scared.

He's all alone without his mama.

Just so you could go out
drinking,
thinking you're hot shit.

That ain't fucking true.

Good Christian people raised
you right.

And you ruined that sweet boy's
life.

And what did you do to fucking
stop me?!

Fuck you.
Fuck you! Fuck you!

Get her outta here. Bitch.

Hey, hey, was all that true?

So what? You wanna fire me?

Leslie.

I don't blame you.

It's fine. You tried.

Just stop.
I don't blame anyone.

Just stop.
Why?

I was happy to have a break.

Okay, I partied and I
didn't mean to spend it all.

I lost everything and I
had to file for bankruptcy.

Okay.
Fucking everyone hated me.

I lost my place.

And so yeah, I left him.

[Sweeney] Okay.

I left him.

Okay, let me just say
bye and I'll drive you.


Hey, it's fine.

Just, I don't think you
should be alone, Leslie.

(country music)

(dial tone)

(phone beeping)

(car engine revving)

What's that?

Do you mind if I lift your
spirits?

Got a buddy who works down at
the station,

and he dug this up for me.

[Newsman] And it was
here at Obe's honky ton-

Look at you.

That a single mother
picked the winning numbers

which after taxes, will
be sending her home

with a life-changing sum of
money.

Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

Leslie, how does it feel?
(Sweeney laughs)

Well, I feel helluvalot
better than yesterday. (laughs)

I understand that you had a
little help

picking the winning numbers?

I picked the same ones I
always do.

[Newsman] And that
was your son's birthday?

Yeah, James, my son James.

You wanna meet him?

[Newsman] Sure.
Okay.

James! Come here.

This is my boy.

Yeah, he's twice as lucky, half
as cute.

[Newsman] And what do you plan
to do

with 190,000 smackeroos?

God, I don't know.

Maybe by a house, buy
something nice for my boy.

Just have a better life!

[Nancy] Hey, Lee, what about
us?

[Friends] What about us?

Drinks are on me!

(crowd cheers)

[Newsman] And you James,
is there something special

that momma owes you now?

What? Being born ain't enough?

A guitar, so I can be the next
Waylon.

[Friends] Oh, yeah.

(Leslie cheers)

And I want her to open a
diner.

She always wanted a diner.

Hey, well, would you call it
Leslie's?

(Leslie scoffs)

Well, I hope to be there on
opening day.

Well, we're looking
forward to ya. (cheers)

Alright, well, from all
of us at Channel 10 News;

here's to Leslie!

We wish you all the best.

(Leslie cheers)

Oh, I'm gonna watch that
again, you look so good!

No, no.

Just gonna rewind it.

I said I don't wanna
watch it again, goddammit.

I said no, if you just
listened the first time,

then you wouldn't get your
feelings hurt.

I just thought it'd be nice
to...

Get out.

Hey, come on, I just
thought it'd be nice

if we watch it together just to
remind you

that you're not the piece of
shit

that everybody says you are.

Right, what I saw was a
good mama loving on her boy,

but I guess I wasn't thinking.

No, you weren't thinking.

You're shoving your way into
my life and you know what?

It's my life.

Jesus Christ, this fucking week!

Well, I'm sorry I got
the fucking tape thing.

Don't you fucking swear at me!

He --

He ain't never gonna speak to me
again.

My folks don't wanna fucking
speak to me,

and everyone in town tries
to avoid me like the plague,

and my boy doesn't wanna see me.

And I'm fucking stuck
here with you and Royal,

pair of fucking hilljacks
like the shit icing

on my shit fucking life.

Ya know?

Me and Royal are the best
thing that happened to you.

So don't call us names.

And your family won't talk to
you

because they shouldn't after
what you did.

But you're living, right?

(Leslie laughs)

I'm sorry it ain't a fairy tale.

We all should have done
things differently.

But you're what's wrong with
your life, not anyone else.

Fuck you.

Okay

Alright, just sit down, Leslie.

Fuck you.

Come on, let's just talk about
it.

Where are you gonna go?
What are you gonna do?

I know where you're gonna go.

And everything you did to get
better

is just gonna be gone.

Well, it ain't you're concern.

'Cause I fucking quit!

(coin into slot)


(phone ringing)

[Operator] Hello, no one is
available

to take your call at this time.

Please leave a message after the
tone.

(phone beeps)

James, it's me.

I'm so sorry for what I did to
you.

I love you so much, and uh...

I love you sweetie.

(country music)

(latin music)

(rock music)

(country music)

How much?

[Bert] Seven, but for
you we'll say seven.

I think drinking alone's a
mortal sin.

We toasting to something?

Nothing good.


You are gorgeous.

I'll drink to that.

Go ahead.

(glasses clink)

Why did you come and talk to me?

What do you mean?

Did you see something in me
you like?

I do. Me, in about an hour.

Oh, that's good.

If you ain't interested,
you just say so, lady.

Come on, tell me.

Did you see something special in
me?

Or did you see a sure thing?

I think you're...

I think I'm waiting on someone
else.

Lots of fun until I got
something on my mind, huh?

I guess, I can talk to you if
you want.

Oh, I bet you can talk real
good.

I bet you can tell me how
beautiful I am.

If you want.

Tell me I'm good.

Tell me I ain't a piece of shit.

You ain't.

You're good.

You got a car, mister?

(car engine revving)

Well, where did she go?

How the hell I know, Sweeney?

Goddammit!

Sweeney, how are you?

Get out of my way.

If you're looking for
Lee, this is the place.

What is wrong with you, woman?

You ain't gonna change her.

Just get out of my way, Pete.

Why don't you get out of my
way?

Watch it, boy.

This boy'll whoop your ass.

(men grunting)

Hit him!
Goddammit!

Hit him, Pete. Hit him.

Damn it, get!

Shit! I'll kill him!

You ain't gonna do
shit, you little pissant.

Sit down and shut up.

Fuck you!

Fuck all y'all, I was
standing up for y'all

Guess what y'all? Next round's
on Pete!

(people cheering)

Yeah, drink your Coors
Light on me, assholes!

Hey Bert,

if she ain't coming back,

you mind if I give these
lovely children a home?


(soft music)

(fast breathing)

(car engine revving)

(car door shuts)

(Sweeney knocks)

(birds chirping)

(car horn honking)

Goddamn it, woman!

Have you been drinking?

No.

Well, I don't even know
what you think you're doing

because there's no conversation
between us

till you start apologizing.

I want the ice cream shop.

What? That?


I spent too much of my life

hiding with people I don't even
know.

And I'm done with hiding

and I'm sure as shit
done with being run off.

So you're gonna live in there?

I'm gonna make something out
of it and you're gonna help!

Why are you yelling at me?

Because I'm excited! Get me a
hammer!

Wait, you think you can
just tell me what to do

after you called me names-

Get me a hammer.

Okay.

(door opens)
(door closes)

(grunts) Watch out!

[Sweeney] Oh, watch out for
nails.

Alright, this is it.

[Sweeney] You need help?

No, I got it. (sighs)

You know this is Royal's
daddy's, right?

[Sweeney] Yeah.
He thought it'd

be a real hit with the
kids, but didn't work out.

Now it's just been sitting
here, like, 40 years

just waiting for someone to give
it shot.

Yeah, like a tetanus
shot or a hepatitis shot.

(both laugh)

Look, I saw that video and I
know you're excited about this,

but I mean, what do you know

about running a place like this?

Well, what'd you know
about running a motel?

No, I'm serious, alright?

I mean, unless you're hiding
some

other jackpot somewhere,

I mean, you gotta get a
fryer, you gotta get a grill.

That's expensive.

And then you gotta hire a
cook and you gotta make menus,

you gotta get a soda
machine, you gotta get-

Hey, that's very good,
do you wanna work here?

All right. I mean, I
understand that you're excited,

but honestly, how are you
planning on paying for this?

I mean, you can't ask us
for a raise 'cause we can't,

we don't have it.

What?

I'm gonna move in with you.

I can save.

I can work on weekends.

Hey, it might take 10
years, but let's do it.

Okay.

Yeah? (laughs)

Well, I mean, I gotta ask
Royal.

But you gonna ask him?

Yeah, yeah, I'll ask him.

Damn

Why are you so good to me?

Well

I think it's pretty obvious by
now.

(soft music)

Okay.
(Leslie chuckles)

So we got work to do?

Later.
Okay. (laughs)

(soft music continues)

(birds chirping)

(train chugging)

Alright, floors are lookin'
good.

I don't know, I think
we should mop em again.

Oh, you're stalling.

Royal, we're doing this!

I'm shakin' like a goddamn
leaf.

Still think we shoulda
called the place "Royal's."

Put on some costumes, do it up
big.

I ain't dressing up
like a goddamn princess.

I know, a couple of
knights and a bridge troll.

I like it.

People like themes.

I said no, okay? Shut up.

(Sweeney laughs)

(door unlocks)

(all cheering)

(claps) Here we go.

Order up!

Here we go.

(Royal laughs)

Well, it's pretty quiet.

We've been open a minute,

not even.

(crickets chirping)

Fuck 'em.

Well, I don't know why
I'm doing this, anyway.

Why it even matters.

They're just being mean.

They'll have to eat.

They'll come, they'll see.

(sighs) I need a cigarette.

(door opens)
(door closes)

(crickets chirping)

(taps flask)

(inhales deeply)


(door opens)
(door closes)

We're closing up!

What the...

(car engine revving)

Oh, here we go, it's about
time.

Royal, we got one.

[Leslie] Well, tell 'em we're
closed.

Lee, it's a customer.

No, they've had all day, I'm
going home.

Hey, Lee.
What?

Maybe you oughta slip out the
back.

I'll take care of it.

You go to the back.

No, I got it, it's fine.

Go on.
[Sweeney] No, I got it.

Go on.

Okay.

Take this.

Welcome to Lee's, how can I help
you?

(door closes)

Two please.

Just right here.

What's wrong with a table?

Well, that's reserved. For
members.

So will Dutch be joining you
tonight?

No.
Okay.

Well, I'll just get a menu for
you then

I'll just...

You're a little late,
so you wanna be quick

before we close the grill.

Lee, you wanna pull
it back just a little?

You did it, Nance.

No one came.

Congratulations, you
sure fucking showed me.

Little girl-

I mean, Jesus fucking Christ,

couldn't you done this like a
year ago?

You watched me do all this

knowing you're gonna take it
away from me.

We was family.

How fucking mean are you?

I'm sorry for what happened.

Do you hear me? I'm sorry.

And you were right, I
could have stopped you.

I saw what was happening,

I could have stopped it and I
didn't.

'Cause I was having fun.

But for all the nights you
made me hold that little boy,

all the times you made a liar
out of me

when I was the only one telling
him,

"Don't you listen to them
people.

I know your mama.

She loves you too much
to do you like this."

You shouldn't have left.

I don't care how bad you fucked
up, how stupid you looked,

that little boy loved you.

We all did.

I ain't never gonna forgive you
for that.

And I don't ask you to forgive
me,

but I think we've all
done enough suffering.

Thank you.

Yeah.

Now

wipe your face and

turn your head.

What?

Oh my God.

I'll take two of them specials
and

I'd appreciate it if
you didn't spit in 'em.

Two specials, hold the spit.

Are you okay?

Yeah.
Yeah?

(door opens)

(door closes)

Hi.
Hi.

I guess I'll sit here.

Sure, yeah.

(door swings opens)

Hey, how you doing?

Sweeney.

James, nice to meet you.

Yeah, nice to meet you.

So did you drive all the way
down here?

I did.

Okay.

Are you hungry?

I am.

Okay, alright.

Well, I'm just gonna fix this
fryer,

but maybe we can chat it up
later.

What do you think?

Yeah.
Alright.

Just made that pot of coffee.

Okay, thanks.

Well, would you like some
coffee?

Please.
Yeah, okay.

It's nice and hot.

Makes it good.

Sugar's here.

Alright, thanks.

Thank you.

(Leslie laughs)

(bell chimes)

Okay, two specials comin' in
hot.

Okay, pasta fazool.

You got any silverware?

Oh God, yes.

Got it.

I'll just leave you to it.

This is salt and pepper.

Yeah, thanks.

Mom.

Yeah?

It's great.

I missed you, baby...

I've got pasta on my shirt.

(both laugh)

Oh, God, I missed you.

(soft guitar music)

Yeah.

Oh, baby.

(soft guitar music continues)

Thank you for coming.
