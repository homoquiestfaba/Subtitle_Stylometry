president trumps former

campaign chairman Paul manafort
facing day two of his trial for

alleged financial fraud.

Prosecutors arguing that the
money went towards supporting

manaforts lavish lifestyle
including multiple homes,

expensive cars and watches and
even a $15,000 ostrich jacket.

Much has been made of the
fact that my client purchased a

$15,000 ostrich coat.

But I ask you, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury, does that

make him guilty?

<i>( Cheers and applause )
The defense rests.</i>

Its "the late show with
Stephen Colbert."

Tonight, the tweet goes on.

Plus, Stephen welcomes
Ewan McGregor

Adam pally
and economist Paul drugman on a

roller coaster.

Featuring Jon batiste and stay
human.

And now, live on tape from the
ed Sullivan theater in New York

city, its Stephen Colbert!

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Stephen: Hey!</i>

Stephen: Oh, please!

Have a seat, everybody!

Thank you so much.

What a lovely-- lovely night,
lovely audience.

Welcome to "the late show."

Im your host, Stephen Colbert.

Well, another day, another
presidential tweet-nado.

Get yourself down in the
basement, because the tweet-nado

is coming.

And brace yourself-- this one is
about the Russia investigation:

And brace yourself-- this one is
about the Russia investigation:

"Yes, we have found the smocking
gun.

It was not the Trump champagne
that was collaging with Russia.

Crock-ed Hillary is the one that
is guilty of that contusion.

Switch punt!"<i>
(</i>

<i>laughter )</i>

And this isnt even the worst of
trumps tweets today, this is:

Donald Trump is telling his
Attorney General to shut down

the investigation of Donald
Trump.

Rudy should tell him that just
because hes doing it in public,

doesnt mean its not
obstruction of justice.

Public urination is still
urination.

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Allegedly.</i>

Allegedly.

Whats his next tweet going
to be?

"Jeff sessions should shut it
down right now before Mueller

sees this tweet and uses it as
evidence against me.

I cant go to jail.

Im sweet meat.

Space force, take me away."

<i>( Laughter )
(</i>

<i>cheers and applause )</i>

Now-- slow that down a little.

Slow that down a little.

Trumps freaking out this time
because its day two of the

trial of former Trump campaign
manager and man undecided over

which ostrich to wear, Paul
manafort.

<i>( Laughter )
Now, its a tough time for</i>

manafort, but one person has
gone out of their way to be nice

to him: The courtroom sketch
artist.

ID say thats a very flattering
portrait.

But thats just what he looks
like on the outside.

Heres the sketch of his soul.

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Of course, this is-- again, we</i>

dont know.

Of course, this is just
manaforts first trial.

Hes actually got another one
coming up in D.C. that will

focus more on manaforts actual
work for Ukraine, rather than

his finances.

And the charges include
conspiracy to defraud the united

states.

Yes, theres just too much crime
to pack into one trial.

<i>( Laughter )
They had to split the crimes</i>

into two parts, like a Harry
Potter movie.

Its "Paul manafort and the
prisoner of lewisburg federal

penitentiary."

Things dont--<i> (</i>

<i>cheers and applause )</i>

Flip them on trumpem.

Things dont look good for
manafort.

As one former prosecutor said,
manafort basically only has two

real options at this point:
Prison or pardon.

And its time for trumps new
game show: "Prison or pardon!"

"Okay, okay, Paul manafort for
the pardon.

Are you nervous?

You should be.

Okay.

How much collusion was there?

None, some, or, collusion
is not a crime?

Would you like to phone a
friend?

Tough (bleep).

Theyre testifying against you.

<i>( Laughter )
But-- you can take these away</i>

now.

But it looks like manaforts not
getting his pardon, in part

because the trial isnt
televised, and according to

one reporter, "if youre playing
for anything with president

Trump, you almost have to appear
on television."

Yes, for Trump to care about
you, you have to appear on TV.

Which is why im pitching the
new CBS series "latino toddler,

private eye."

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.</i>

Jon: You produced it?

Stephen: Yeah, im
producing.

Im producing that.

But Trump does have sympathy for
manafort because he also

tweeted, "looking back on
history, who was treated worse,

Wow, wow.

Trump really knows how to make
you seem sympathetic: Compare

you to americas sweetheart,
al Capone-- who, I remind you,

died on an inescapable prison
island of syphilis.

<i>( Laughter )
"But theyre treating Paul way</i>

worse.

They wont even let him have
syphilis."

<i>( Laughter )
And why, why on earth is Trump</i>

calling Capone "alphonse?"
Does he think it makes him seem

classier?

"Ah, yes, the esteemed company
of alphonse Capone and his

fellows: Jefferson dahmer,
Theodore Bundy, and Charles

manson.

Enchante.

Right this way.

Table for four.

Table for four.

Jeffrey, well get you a bib."

Yesterday Trump headed down to
trampa-- tampa-- to hold a

rally.

And he played all the hits,
including his classic impression

of "a president."

Anybody can act presidential.

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Ladies and gentlemen of the</i>

<i>( cheers and applause )
Ladies and gentlemen of the</i>

state of Florida, thank you very
much for being here.

You are tremendous people.

And I will leave now, because I
am boring you to death.

Thank you.

<i>( Applause )
Stephen: After a year and</i>

half of Donald Trump, I would
gladly vote for that stiff guy.

<i>( Laughter )
"Trumps impression of a</i>

president 2020.

Make America bored again."

I dont want to be excited.

I dont want to be entertained.

That is, if I get to vote,
because Trump has an insane new

argument for voter I.D. Laws.

The time has come for voter
I.D. Like everything else.

Voter I.D.

You know, if you go out and you
want to buy groceries, you need

a picture on a card.

You need I.D.

Stephen: Oh, yeah, oh,
yeah.

Everybody knows that.

You know that, Jon, right?

You have to have an I.D. To buy
groceries.

You bring your I.D. To buy
groceries?

Jon: I never needed it.

Stephen: Thats why youre
so skinny.

You cant buy food.

Thats your problem.

Thats your problem, man.

Everybody knows you cant even
go into a grocery store without

an I.D.

I mean, who hasnt been pulled
over at the kroeger, pushing

your cart, when suddenly:
"Byuuu.

All right, pull it over.

License and registration."

"What seems to be the problem,
officer?"

"Do you know how fast these
potatoes were going?"

"You can be on your way."

Clearly, clearly--<i> (</i>
<i>applause )</i>

â™ª â™ª
clearly, Trump hasnt been

grocery shopping since 2000 and
never.

<i>( Laughter )
But I would love to see him try.</i>

"Okay, ive got two cans of diet
coke and this pink mud they turn

into burgers.

What do I do now?

Do I put the coins in your
mouth?

Do I leave the money on the
dresser?

You know what?

<i>( Laughter )
You know what, you know what?</i>

Ill tell you what, ill tell
what you-- im asking.

I dont know.

<i>( Applause )
I dont know.</i>

Im gonna leave.

My lawyer will be in touch.

This never happened."

Trump has been taking heat
because farmers have been hurt

by his tariffs, but he knows
these farmers are doing fine.

China had others-- remember
this-- have targeted our

farmers.

Not good, not nice.

And you know what our farmers
are saying?

"Its okay, we can take it."

These are incredible people.

"We can take it."

Stephen: Oh, yeah, yeah,
oh, yeah.

Farmers can take it.

In fact, they love these
tariffs.

I believe we have a statement
from the head of the American

farm bureau:
Thank you, sir.

May I have another?

<i>( Laughter )
(</i>

<i>applause ).</i>

Stephen: But-- im not sure
if that was it.

But the biggest story out of
last nights rally involved CNN

reporter and man mad at the
sunset for being beautiful, Jim

acosta.

Trump has been attacking acosta
and the rest of CNN, and his

supporters at the rally piled
on.

And, wolf, just to give you a
sense of whats happening right

now, you can hear there is a
chorus of boos and other chants

of this Trump crowd here in
tampa Florida, saying things

like "CNN sucks," "go home," and
"fake news."

Wolf, obviously, all those
things are false.

Were staying right here.

Well do our job and report on
this rally to all of our viewers

here tonight.

Stephen: "Yes, were going to
ignore these people shouting

hateful things, and get to the
news: The president of the

United States shouting hateful
things.

Acosta<i> (</i>
<i>applause )</i>

-- Yeah.

Jon: Same thing.

Stephen: Fans of shouting
here tonight.

Acosta even posted some footage
of the crowd attacking him

directly.

<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Its going to see</i>

roseanne keeping busy.

( Cheers and applause )
But-- she looks good.

She looks really good.

Jon: It look like her to
you?

Stephen: Rested.

She looks really rested.

But it turns out this vicious
mob may not truly despise

acosta, because another reporter
at the rally last night pointed

out that, "Trump supporters can
boo and say forever that they

hate CNN and @acosta, but after
the cameras are off, all I see

is them asking his opinion on
everything under the sun and if

they can take pictures with
him."

"Hey, acosta, you lying sack of
crap-- can I get an autograph?

Make it out and sign it,
Jim acosta, lying sack of

crap."
thanks so much.

Its for my grandmother."

So theyre kind of-- theyre
kind of play-acting-- it seems

like theyre play-acting their
anger for the cameras.

In fact, many journalists said
that the crowd booing at trumps

enemies was like a wrestling
bout.

So, Jim acosta, you should
just embrace your new role as a

wrestling villain like this:
"Listen up and listen good,

baby!

Its me, jimbo the accoster,
enemy of the people, comin to

you live from the Trump rally!

Wooo!

And im ready to take on the
golden goon himself with my two

biggest weapons: Facts!

And sources!

Can I get a "hell, yeah"?

<i>( Cheers and applause )
"So, look out, Donnie-boy,</i>

because im challenging you to a
press conference, no questions

barred!

The reporter versus the
distorter!

Im gonna spank you harder than
stormy Daniels with a rolled-up

Forbes, baby.
So get ready, trumpy, because

the pain train is coming, and
youre going down.

Wooo-wooo!

And this time, its gonna be on
the record."

Woooo!"
weve got a great show for you

tonight.

Ewan McGregor is here.

But when we return, today Paul
Ryan is a man.

Stick around.

<i>( Band playing )
(</i>

<i>cheers and applause )</i>

Stephen: Hey, everybody!

Jon batiste and stay human!

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Stephen: Well, folks,</i>

welcome back.

You know, there was some
surprising news recently for

speaker of the house and man
test-driving the concept of

smiling, Paul Ryan.

Ryan is going to appear on the
upcoming season of pbss

"finding your roots with Henry
Louis gates Jr.," a TV series in

which famous guests learn about
their ancestral histories.

I assumed the most shocking
thing theyd find was that

Ryans great-grandparents were
Eddie munster and grover.

<i>( Laughter )
But it turns out they found</i>

something way more unexpected.

Surprise!

Paul Ryans slightly Jewish!

Havent the Jewish people
suffered enough?

<i>( Laughter )
(</i>

<i>applause )</i>

I just--
the anti-defamation league has

already responded, saying,
"what?

Run the tests again!"<i>
(</i>

<i>laughter )</i>

This, naturally, leads to one
burning question: Paul Ryan, are

you even circumcised, bro?

<i>( Laughter )
Im guessing no, but, Paul,</i>

thats the price of admission.

Which is why were are excited
to offer you the chance of a

lifetime with "the late shows
live Paul Ryan brisstravaganza."

Come on my show and get a live
bris.

Mohels are standing by.

Think of it this way: The
foreskin is only %1 of the

penis.

And we know how much you love
cuts for the %1.

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Well be right back with Ewan</i>

McGregor.

Thank you!

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Stephen: Hey, everybody!</i>

Welcome back, everybody.

To our show<i> (</i>

<i>cheers and applause )</i>

Ladies and gentlemen, you know
my first guest tonight from

"trainspotting," the "star wars"
prequels, and tvs "Fargo."

He now stars in the new film,
"Christopher Robin."

Oh!

What to do.

What to do.

What to do.

What to do, indeed.

Pooh?

Christopher Robin.

No!

No, no, no, no, no!

You-- you cant be here.

Stephen: Please welcome, back
to "the late show," Ewan

McGregor.

<i>( Cheers and applause )
(</i>

<i>applause )</i>

Hello!

Very lively.

Stephen: Yeah, very lively.

What a lovely crowd.

Stephen: Yeah, theyre nice
people.

Theyre nice people.

Wooo!

Yeah!

Is that yours?

Stephen: No, no, no, thats
yours.

You dont have one.

Stephen: Mines over here.

Mine burns when you drink it.

Now welcome-- welcome back to
"the late show"."

Good to see you again.

Thank you.

Im glad to be here.

That clip was extraordinary.

It sounds like the real pooh.

It is.

Stephen: How did they get
him hes no longer with us.

Its the other guy.

Stephen: I hear hes good,
too.

Its the pooh im familiar
with.

Stephen: Its the perfect
pooh voice.

And youre pretty good, too.

It really sounds like Ewan
McGregor.

They have a guy that does me.

Stephen: Well, you are a
star.

Im sure they provideicatering
of all sorts.

All sorts, yes.

Stephen: Did you play the
grown-up Christopher Robin, what

was it like working across from
that bear?

Did you grow up with the books?

I did.

I I was read the books as a kid.

And read them to my kids, and
I I was familiar with them, and

the Disney cartoons for sure,
and the voices.

Then to be on set with him,
pooh-- it was amazing.

They had a little pooh, that I--<i>
(</i>

<i>laughter )</i>

-- That I got to play with on
set.

So we had a real-- we had a
little Teddy bear that looks

exactly like the pooh you see in
the film there.

But hes not a puppet.

He wasntab anamatronnic.

He was just to look at.

And his little face looked up at
me, and I got used to working

with this Teddy bear, and I
really liked working with him.

<i>( Laughter )
He was so easy to work with.</i>

Stephen: He didnt step on
your lines.

No!

He was very generous, and he was
always there on camera.

Stephen: Giving you 100%,
even though he wasnt on.

Lets see how familiar you are
with these books.

Okay.

Stephen: Im going to try
to stump you with a simple one.

What is the bears name.

Winnie ther pooh.

Stephen: Its winnie ther
pooh.

Stephen: Exactly.

Stephen: What is his
official name?

Christopher Robin calls him
winnie ther pooh.

Here comes I.

Edward.

So far im doing well.

Stephen: I understand you
took a break after-- what does

that mean "take a break?"
You took a break from acting.

I didnt work.

We finished winnie ther pooh, or
"Christopher Robin," and I

havent worked since then.

And ive never done that.

Ive taken, I dont know, a
six-month break in all the years

ive been working, but this time
I took a long chunk of time off.

Stephen: That sound lovely,
but is it actually lovely in

reality?

Yeah, it was.

I didnt know exactly how I
would deal with it, either.

Because I was never very, very
good at doing nothing or having

nothing to do.

I would take a break knowing I
had a film come coming up or a

play or something to do, and
this time I just had space.

But I really enjoyed it.

And I cant really tell what you
I did, because I dont-- doing

nothing, I was quite busy.

I was quite busy doing nothing.

That song.

â™ª Busy doing nothing
working the whole day through

â™ª trying to find lots of things
not to do

â™ª were busy doing nothing
â™ª isnt it just a crime?

â™ª Wed like to be unhappy but we
never do have the time â™ª

<i>( Applause )
I think its from-- I think its</i>

from "kiss me Kate."

Stephen: Okay.

Do you feel guilty take time--
not guilty-- guilty to your

younger self?

Because your younger self, im
sure-- speaking of myself as

someone who was a young actor--
there was never enough work

because you were always
scrambling, and now youre like,

"im not going to work for a
while."

If I did that, I would hear my
younger self say, "what are you

doing?

Youll never work again."

I got to the point where I
was working, working, working.

I have things I like to do.

I arev motorcycles and cars and
I like to see my children, walk

my dog.

And I was working and not
feeling that I had time for

those things.

And I was thinking what am I
working for?

And so I decided to stop.

And I did all those things, and
it was great.

And now im going back to work
in September.

Im doing a movie called
"Dr. Sleep" a Stephen King

novel.

That one person!

Stephen: Thats another--
so in "Christopher Robin" youre

playing a grown-up child.

Yeah.

Stephen: Youre playing
Christopher grown up, and now

youre playing Danny torrence
from "the shining."

Can you tell me-- I havent read
the book.

Its very faithful to the
book, the script.

If youve read the novel, thats
the story.

Stephen: Dont give
anything away but read the book.

You can read the book and
find out what happens.

Stephen: Does Danny still
have psychic power?

Yes.

Stephen: And thats all you
can tell me?

Yes.

I told you lots of other things
right now.

Stephen: Exactly.

Exactly.

You showed me some horrible
images.

Have you ever met Stephen King?

No, but im looking forward
to it.

I have not done so, but ID like
to.

Stephen: Very pleasant and
creepy at the same time.

Oh, yeah.

Stephen: I have a prized
picture of the two of us

together.

We had a lovely-- this is me, me
and Stephen ceng just hanging

out together.

Thats what hes like all the
time.

<i>( Laughter )
Did you--</i>

did you dress similarly on
purpose?

Oh, twins.

Stephen: Yes, we were
creepy twins together.

You have been an ambassador for
unicef.

Yes.

Stephen: For how long?

Since 2004.

My friend Charlie and I did a
motorcycle trip in 2004 from

London to New York, we went east
from London, and then --

Stephen: You drove across
Asia.

We rode across Europe and
Ukraine and Russia and

Kazakhstan and Mongolia and we
flew the bikes to Anchorage and

--
Stephen: You flew the bikes b

to Anchorage?

You didnt think of getting a
lot of speed up over the

peninsula and jump it.

Like a man would.

Or do it in winter when you can
go across the ice.

Stephen: Or skip across the
crab boats.

What is this?

Where are you here?

That look likes in Iraq, I
think.

Yeah, thats in Iraq, a year--
18 months ago I visited

different refugee camps in Iraq
with unicef, and that was

extraordinary.

I mean, its impossible to
imagine the scale of the problem

and how many people are
affected.

I was just in three different
camps in Iraq for people that

had fled from mosul, really, and
different parts of Iraq because

there are problems there.

You would stand and look out and
all-- im not joking-- all you

could see were temporary tents,
a-frame tents, frame tents, on

the horizon, just thousands and
thousands and thousands of them,

and you turned around and looked
behind you and all you could see

were graders making the earth
flat for thousands and thousands

more they were going to build
for everybody else being kicked

out of their homes.

It was very extraordinary.

I love unicef and have been so
honored to work with them since

then, since 2004.

I love the work they do on a
very simple way with children in

the field, like giving them
these play areas in refugee

camps-- or wherever it be--
where children can be children

again and just play.

And thats wonderful.

But they also deal with
governments at the governmental

level and everything in between.

And ive always been-- its been
a great honor for me to work

with them as best I can to do
what I can.

Stephen: Thank you so much.

Thank you.

Stephen: "Christopher Robin"
is in theaters this Friday.

Ewan McGregor, everybody!

Well be right back with
Adam pally.

<i>( Cheers and applause )
Stephen: Hey, everybody!</i>

Welcome back to "the late show."

Is
folks, my next guest is an actor

whos starred in "the mindy
project" and "happy endings."

His new film is "dog days."

Let them out!

Let them out!

I know you have someone in
there!

Let them out.

Take it easy.

Whatever you think is happening
is not really happy!

Help!

Help!

I cant breathe.

Im going to puke.

Help!

Somebody!

Its a dog!

Its a dog!

Its a dog!

Stephen: Please welcome, Adam
pally!

<i>( Cheers and applause )
â™ª Adam pally</i>

whoa Adam pally
â™ª

Stephen: Hello?

Hello.

Stephen: Thanks for being
on.

Thank you so much for having
me.

Its such a thrill to be here.

Stephen: I understand you
started off-- did you live in

New York when you started?

I did, I started off at the
upgrade brigade citizens in new

York city.

Stephen: Quality
enterprise.

Quality enterprise.

Stephen: Thats
improvisation which, of course,

is very useful for an actor.

But then you actually did-- you
did the actors studio.

I graduated from want new
school of the actors studio.

Stephen: Thats like Stan
slof ski?

I dont know.

Stephen: You dont know.

I was so checked out.

As soon as I got to the new
school I spent my nights at the

upright citizens brigade, and my
days sleeping through the new

school, so I dont really know
anything about acting.

<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Did you read "an</i>

actor prepares" by constan steen
Stan slof ski?

Yeah.

Stephen: Did you go to any
of those "inside the actor"

studios.

I went to half of one.

<i>( Laughter ).</i>

Stephen: Who was it?

Well-- so they make you go to
one to graduate.

And I, obviously, blew that off.

And then right before I
graduated, like, you have to go

to one.

But the only one left of the
season was Jennifer Lopez.

Which is, like, I dont-- I
guess people find it funny that

she had an "inside the actor"
studio.

Im a big Jennifer Lopez fan.

"Out of sight" is one of my
favorite movies.

And then shes made, like,
others.

<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Can we fact check</i>

that?

Am I right about that.

Stephen: Theyre telling me
she made other movies.

Look at that!

I was right!

So I had to go to that.

And it-- I love Jennifer loped,
like I said, but, you know,

there are so many answers of
questions about the movie "u.

Turn one person can take."

So when the mic got passed to me
to ask a question I kind of

blacked out or something and
decided to do a bit.

And I got up and I was like,
"j.Lo," and she went,

"Jennifer."

And right away I was like, "oh,
god.

This is bad.

This is bad."

But I powered through.

And she was like "Jennifer."

And I said, "I know that you
recently have gone through a

breakup with-- with Casey
affleck"-- dont know why I said

that.

<i>( Laughter )
To which she then quickly</i>

responded, "Ben."

And I was like, "sure, sure,
sure, sure, sure."

Even then people were
embarrassed to be confused to

have an allegiance with Casey
affleck.

Shots fired!

So then-- this is a terrible
long story.

<i>( Laughter )
So then I said, "so ive been</i>

through a breakup, too,
recently.

And I dont know.

Im just feeling like we have a
connection."

<i>( Laughter )
Meanwhile, im, like, 21, way</i>

high.

<i>( Laughter )
And all the real j. Lo fans are,</i>

like, not happy.

Stephen: Sure, and she is
not either.

And shes look at me.

Shes being so sweet, you know.

Shes looking at me like this is
obviously this kid kidding

around.

And then I went even further--
so dumb.

And I was like, "so if youd
like to maybe after your taping,

I represented the DVD of the
movie big fish," which is so

random.

I dont know why.

There was no Netflix and chill
at the time.

<i>( Laughter )
And I was like, "if you want to</i>

come watch it with me."

And she was very sweet and she
was like, "oh, now, thank you

very much."

And it didnt get a laugh,
obviously, and I was horribly

embarrassed.

So I sat back down thinking oh,
god that was very-- very-- very

dumb.

Stephen: But I get to
graduate.

But I get to graduate.

And within three seconds of
sitting down lipton had, like, a

brain aneurysm explosion and
said, "this is a serious class!"

And I was like, "oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

I forgot.

I forgot."

Stephen: You understand you
graduated and you got to

actually work with one of your
acting heroes.

You got to work with deniro.

Di.

Stephen: Who I met and its
a little imposing.

It is a little imposing.

We were shooting a movie called
"dirty grandpa."

And you could tell, he was not
going to be embarrassed about

this one.

<i>( Laughter )
Im never going to get a table</i>

at the Tribeca grille.

Like, that is out.

Can anyway, so I got to work
with deniro in the acclaimed

movie "dirty grandpa."

Oh, man, I dont know why im
publicizing that movie here.

No one saw that four years ago.

Anyway--<i> (</i>

<i>laughter )</i>

Stephen: Are they making a
"dirty grandpa 2?"

Oh, yeah.

I havent gotten the call yet.

<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: I thought they</i>

were.

But go ahead, go ahead.

I think they are.

"Dirty grandpa in Europe."

Super dirty.

Stephen: Do you want to
ever work again?

<i>( Laughter ).</i>

Honestly, im good.

<i>( Laughter )
And not-- not money-wise.</i>

I need the money.

Stephen: But youre good.

I think im good right here
where I am.

( Cheers and applause ).

Stephen: So, keep going.

Go on.

Go on.

So anyway --
Stephen: There is still a

chance.

There is still a chance I
might make it through the story.

Stephen: There is still a
chance this will make it to air.

No!

Stephen: Deniro.

Scorsese directed this one,
right?

No, hes directed "dirty
grandpa 2."

<i>( Laughter )
So im in a scene with deniro,</i>

and it was the first take, and I
was trying to liven it up.

So we did the first take and it
was a funeral scene, and he came

over to give me a hug and I
grabbed him and I tossled his

hair extra hard.

And they ideal cut.

And he was in my ear and-- I
dont do a great deniro.

But he was like, "very funny.

Dont do that again."

And I was like, you know,
"okay."

But, also, were shooting a
movie called "dirty grandpa."

Im gonna do that again.

<i>( Laughter )
Stephen: Damn it.</i>

It does feel like-- it does
feel like weve met before.

So then we did the next take.

And he came over to give me a
hug and hes all sad and I gave

him a hug, and I gave him a
little pat on the butt like

athletes do.

And after the take he came over
and said, "very funny.

Dont ever do that again."

Layoff laugh and I was like, "no
problem," of course.

Stephen: Sure.

And so then the third take he
came over to me, and I went up

to him and I went to give him a
big hug and he saw and he pushed

me.

And I, like, fell back into the
stall.

And they ideal "cut," and I went
over to him and I grabbed him,

and I was like, "very funny,
dont ever-- dont ever do that

again."

Stephen: "Dog days" is in</i>

theaters August 8.

Adam pally, everybody!

<i>( Band playing ) (</i>
<i>cheers and applause )</i>

â™ª Keep on dancing<i>
(</i>

<i>applause ).</i>

Stephen: Oh, my goodness.

Well, welcome back, everybody.

Its August which means theres
just a little time left for

summer fun.

Personally, I love a good roller
coaster.

Its the only socially
acceptable place to strap

yourself into a exphair scream
with a group of strangers.

When I do it at Starbucks, they
ask me to leave.

But just because schools out
doesnt mean you cant learn new

things.

In fact, a roller coaster is a
perfect clam.

Theyre so fast.

Theyre so exciting.

I think they keep you weak even
while learning something as dry

as macroeconomics.

To test that theory I invited
nobel comm Paul krugman to join

me on the nitro roller coaster
at six flags great adventure.

If that sounds like fun to you,
then youre not nobel

prize-winning economist, Paul
krugman.

Okay, Paul krugman, youre an
expert in global economic

theory.

Im an expert at shouting on
roller coasters.

All right.

Stephen: Are you ready to
explain economics to me in two

minutes and 4gs.

Well see how it works.

Stephen: All right, lets
hit it.

How long has it been sunshine
you won a nobel prize?

Seven years.

Stephen: So youre in a bit
of a dry spell.

Working on it.

Stephen: You might be a
flash in the pan.

Yeah, you never know.

Stephen: Why should you
help the economy in a time.

Growth.

Our economy right now, like this
roller coaster, is slowly going

up.

Theres no reason to believe it
will ever drop.

Funny about that.

Things do tend to go wrong now
and then --

Stephen: Have you ever been
on a roller coaster?

Actually, no.

Stephen: This is your first
time ever?

Yes.

Stephen: Okay, youre going
to love it.

Heres the big question for you:
Why do you think that in times

of recession the government
should favor stimulus oifer

austerity?

Whats happening in a
recession...

( Screaming )
Is that everybody is finding

spending...

Stephen: Yeah, but, if
youre a family and you spend

more money than you have, thats
bad.

How can a government spend more
money than it has?

Do I know more about economics
than Paul krugman?

Actually, youd be amazed.

When you actually think about
it, families, they borrow to buy

a house.

Stephen: Another were
almost over.

Just explain global
macro-economic theory?

Should I buy gold?

No.

Stephen: Is it money good
or money bad?

Money is good.

Print much more of it.

Stephen: Print more money.

That brings you to where
peoples wheel warles can buy

bread.

Actually, no, it just brings
prosperity.

Stephen: Okay.

So, bottom line, it seems like
the economy is like a roller

coaster.

In that it goes up, it goes
down, and occasionally makes

meantime to puke.

Yeah, actually, me at the
moment, kind of, yes.

Stephen: Do you think
inflation can ever be good?

Yeah, a little bit can be
helpful.

Stephen: So you think its
a good thing that it will cost

us $12 to buy a photo of us on
the ride?

No, I actually dont want a
photo of us on this ride.

<i>( Laughter ).</i>

Stephen: Well, Paul
krugman, thank you so much for

explaining global macro-economic
theory to me.

Now I never have to talk about
it again.

Well be right back.

Out, please!

<i>( Cheers and applause )</i>

Late show."

Tune in tomorrow when my guests
will be Chloe grace moretz and

bobcat goldthwait.

Now stick around for James
corden.

Good night!

Stephen: Is that what

ostriches sound like?

Yes.

Stephen: Wait a second!

Do we need-- do they make that
sound?

They make that sound.

Stephen: Okay, great.
