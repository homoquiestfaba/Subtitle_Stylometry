(Door opening)

Julia.

Sorry, I'm a bit
early. The train...

Are you kidding me?
Earlier the better.

Come in, please.

I'm ready for you, okay?

Can I take your coat?

So this is the pad.

It's what happens when your dad

Is the leading celebrity
sports surgeon.

("The Mountain" by Wooden Wand)

Is there anything I can get you?

Champagne?

Perfect.

Feel free to look
around, alright?

I'm sorry it took
me so long to call.

You know, after
ambulatory, I went straight

Into the OR for the
last couple months and,

Holy Christ.

I mean, talk about a nightmare.

I don't ever remember
being on my feet that long,

And the blood, I mean

That's somethin' I
could do without.

("The Mountain" by Wooden Wand)

How do you stand it?

What?

The blood.

How do you stand all that blood?

I mean, I think I
fainted every day

The entire first week.

Guess it doesn't
bother me that much.

At least I know
I'll never be my dad.

I'm sorry, I'm
bumblin' all over here.

It's just, you know, the
moment I saw you standing there

In your scrubs,
lookin' all sweet,

I couldn't stop
thinkin' about you.

So here's to the holy
grail of champagne.

Shipwrecked 1907 Heidseick,

And to you.

(Glass clinking)

("The Mountain" by Wooden Wand)

One more before we go?

(Door slamming)

[Blurred figure] Oh boy.

(Doors opening)

(Doors slamming)

(Gravel crunching)

Let's go.

Come on, let's get
the fuck outta here.

Alright, alright,
I got it, I got it.

Come on, the fuckin' tide
will take her, let's go.

(Julia gasps)

The fuckin' tide'll
take her, come on.

Let's go.

(Julia crying)

(Ominous music)

(Rock music)

A vodka.

A glass. Fill it.

[Female bartender] Haven't
seen you here before.

Are you new to the
area or you just...

Thank you.

(Keys clicking)

Julia?

Yes?

I suppose you enjoyed your
impromptu little week off.

Yes, thanks.

You don't think some sort
of explanation's in order?

There was a family
crisis, I couldn't...

Oh. Sorry, I didn't
know, I had no idea.

Is everything alright?

[Dr. Lin's assistant]
Excuse me, Dr. Lin?

Yael Frankel?

[Dr. Lin] Yes of
course, Yael, come in.

Please, have a seat.

So...

I wanna look like her.

[Dr. Lin] Well what's
wrong with the way you look?

If I have to wake up
one more day like this,

I'm going to kill myself.

(Rock music)

Like clockwork.

Lady Snowblood.

Oh you don't know who
Lady Snowblood is.

Born for revenge.

It's on the house.

(Door creaking)

(People talking)

("Two Wolves" by Lark)

I'm not kidding.

You're not kidding about what?

It's like she's on a
fuckin' miracle drug.

You'd think she
had grown a dick.

Whoa. Wait a second,
what does that even mean?

You gotta have a dick
in order to feel good?

All I'm saying is,

The way she's strutting around,

You'd think she strapped one on.

She's breakin' guy's
balls all over.

[Woman #2] Yeah, cause
only a big fuckin' dick

Can break a set of balls.

about big fuckin' dicks?

You gotta quit stuffin'
socks down your pants, bitch.

[Woman #2] No,
no, no, fuck that.

(Female bartender laughs)

Homegirl was raped,

And now she's pullin'
herself together

And you gotta associate
that with a fuckin' dick?

Fuck you.
So. She is taking something?

Or is this therapy
thing for real?

Load of ass, if
you ask wanna ask me.

Well from what I understand,

The therapy's quite unique.

Vastov? He only takes
the most extreme cases.

Sexual assault, rape,

And the therapy itself involves

Physically taking our power back

From the ones who stole it.

Seduction, blood, vengeance.

(Loud industrial music)


(People talking)

(Door creaking)

Oh, sorry.

Please. Treat yourself.


(Ominous music)

I, uh, couldn't help
overhearing you in the bar.

The therapy.

Is it real?

I was raped.

(Nadya laughs)

(Door creaking)

(Toilet flushing)

(Julia gasps)

(Ominous music)


You're looking for me.

Who are you?

I'm Sadie.

May I?

Yeah. He'll like you.

But tell me, did you
go to the police?

Did you report what
happened to you?

It's real.

He can help you.

(Sad music)

That's why I need
a dermatologist

To have them removed
from my back.

[Dr. Lin's assistant]
And where is it?

Right by my shoulder.

Sorry, my shoulder blade.

(Suspenseful music)

There were four of them.

The one, he,

Dr. Malone, Piers

Is on rotation in
plastic surgery.

He seemed so nice.

That's the first
time anyone's been

So nice to me.

(Loud rock music)

Look at her fuckin'
eyes, she's beautiful.

Hey, in case ya
hadn't figured it out,

Succinylcholine.

She can feel all of it,

But you can't move a muscle.

(Man laughing)

Let me see that.

No.

Adam.

(Loud rock music)

Adam!

Where'd you find her?

Where'd you find her?

What difference does it make?

She's a fuckin' nurse.
She's a goddamn whore!

Fuck this.

Fuck that tight
ass fuckin' bitch,

She ain't no fuckin' nurse,
she's a fuckin' whore.

She's a fuckin' whore.

(Loud rock music)

(Man grunting loudly)

Get in there.

Come on.

(Man moaning)

(Door opening)

[Dr. Sgundud] Julia.

(Ominous music)

I understand you never
went to the police.

And, did you
document any of this?

The marks.

Go to the hospital?

May I ask why?

(Clock ticking)

I want those men to suffer.

[Dr. Sgundud] If personal
revenge is what you're after,

I'm sorry, I can't help you.

Making it personal will
keep you in a victim mindset

And will prevent
you from healing.

Julia. Julia.

Please understand we will
still tackle the problem

In the physical world.

We will cut it at its root,

But in a manner that helps
you transcend the ego

And brings you true
and lasting freedom,

Where I can assure you,

No one will ever hold
power over you again.

There are, however,
some conditions

You should be aware of, in
case you choose to proceed.

You will need to give
yourself over, completely,

To my methods,

And should you, at
any time, take matters

Into your own hands,
you must realize

There will be
severe consequences.

Do you understand?

(Julia gasps)

training starts now.

Sit.

You wanna be a little
girl your whole life?

Sit down.

(Eyeglasses crunching)

You got contacts, I hope.

They weren't prescription.

Don't be mistaken.

You are perfect as you are.

We all are.

But to lure them, we play
society's little game.

Painted face,

Mask, complete denial

Of our creatureliness.

You're stunning.

You don't need me
to tell you that.

(Train tracks squealing)

(Ominous music)

(Heavy metal music)

We want the ones who think the
world revolves around them.

Their bank accounts,
their puny little dicks.

The pseudo-macho
corporate types who

Pop Viagra pills on the sly.

We want the ones with
their lady friends.

See, they'll follow
without letting on.

Now listen, no one can
see you make your move.

When you exit, you exit alone.

Observe.

(Exciting club music)

Wait for it.

Wait for it.

(People talking)

Now.

Usually, we make them
follow us outside,

But just for show.

(Loud club music)



(Sexy club music)

Shot of vodka.

I can get that for
ya. Make that two shots.

Hey so, what's your name?

Okay.

Look, you don't
wanna talk to him.

You don't want any
direct contact.

People see you together,
you become a liability.

And you don't walk
right up next to him.

(Upbeat club music)

(Ominous music)

Hey.

You little slut.

You wanna piece
of this guy, huh?

Sick bastard!

Fuck you, what the
fuck are you doing?

What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

I didn't do nothin', I swear.

I saw you!
It's nothin' baby, please.

(Somber music)

She would stand there watching

As the pig breathed down on me

And it was my fault.

He wanted me more than her.

His own wife?

My mother.

She's the one who told everyone.

Friends, school.

Julia is a whore.
Julia is a whore.

Julia is a whore.

[Dr. Sgundud] Was that the
first time you cut yourself?

You never thought to...
Kill myself?

But I didn't.

And it wasn't out of fear.

It was something else.

It's like I,

It's like I knew

I was meant for something,

Something

Majestic.

(Cars passing)

(Suspenseful music)

(People struggling)

(Female bartender crying)

(Glass breaking)

(Suspenseful music)

[Dr. Sgundud] The next
stage of your therapy

Will be recorded.

In part, so we don't lose
sight of the clinical nature

Of the proceedings,

But also for insurance purposes.

Some patients, they

Struggle with the ramifications.

You'll forgive me for not
going into more detail

At this time,

But don't worry.

Sadie will be
there to guide you.

Good.

There is one other thing.

[Dr. Sgundud] Yes?

I saw one of them.

Adam.

I think he was looking for me.

[Dr. Sgundud] What
do you think he wants?


[Dr. Sgundud] How
does that make you feel?

Julia? Fantasizing
about the past,

Blaming others for
what's happened to you,

Goes against what
we're doing here.

It is imperative that
you not make it personal.

I can only say that would
be a very dangerous path.

Are we clear on this?

What are you, like
Cinderella or something?

I want you inside me.

ahead and cut it out right now?

Sorry, I should have...
Yeah, nice of you

To join us, Julia.

Here just in time to
help remove a mole

From Mr. Gordon's back.

Julia.

Julia.

Scrub up.

(Water running)

She ain't no fuckin' nurse,

She's a fuckin' whore.

Okay.

Easy as pie.

Now Julia will see to it

That you're left without
so much as a scar.

(Sinister music)

(Door slams)

(Keys clicking)

(Ominous music)

(Sinister metal music)

Adam.

It's Julia.

Julia, are you there?


Fuck, I can't
believe it's you.


I really wanted
to talk to you.

I didn't mean to

Show up at your
office like that,

I just...

I wasn't sure if you'd see me.

Ever since that night,
I haven't stopped

Thinking about you.

Something, I don't know,

Something inside me changed.

Is there a chance we could meet

Just to talk?

Please?


Fuck.

Sorry.

(Door creaking)

What the fuck?

What?

What is this?

It's nothing.

What the fuck?

It's just a little blood.

So why is it all
over your fucking coat?

You can't go out on your own,

It doesn't work like that.

Didn't he tell you?

Julia, what did you?

I work in a plastic
surgeon's office.

People bleed.

So I missed a little, so what?


I need you to listen to me.

You're one of his children now.

He'll look after you,

But God forbid you
go against him.

You can't go against this man.

Look at you.

You don't understand.

I've seen it.

He takes everything.

(Sad music)

Shh.

When this is all over,

I want us to get away.

Just Julia and Sadie.

Far, far away.

(Distant sirens)

Sadie, what are you doing?

(Television chatter)

(Water running)

33 year-old man was found

Brutally murdered in the
early hours of the morning

Near Brooklyn Sunset
Park, Chinatown area.

Police report today that
the victim, Marcus Ryan,

A recent Harvard
Business School graduate,

Was found with over
90 knife wounds

To the head and torso,

And in a startling addendum
to the already vicious attack,

We have recently learned
that Ryan was also castrated.

Police are currently scouring
surveillance video footage

From the hours leading
up to the murder,

But as of yet, there are
no leads or witnesses.

Ryan was last seen
at the Balcony bar

In Brooklyn's hip
Williamsburg area,

When, at some point
in the evening,

He was said to have
simply disappeared.

(Sinister music)

(Glass bottles clinking)

(Sinister music)

Hey.

What am I gonna do with you?

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

Julia, what is
going on with you?

Ever since you were
gone for that week...

[Dr. Lin's assistant] Dr. Lin?

I want you to come see me
in my office before you go.

Okay?

Yeah, Valerie.

[Dr. Lin's assistant] Would
you mind taking a quick look

At this?
Sure, sure.

(Sinister music)

(Train tracks squealing)

(Sinister music)

you'd go to the cops.

I thought, any day now.

Then, when nothing happened

I had to find you.

I was weak.

I should have stopped them.

Even if it... sorry.

Funny thing is, in a way,

It's the best thing
that could have

Ever happened to me.

Up until then, I was

Hiding from the world.

Suddenly, I was forced
to look at myself.

Any notion that I had
of myself, as a woman,

A victim,

Soft, defenseless.

It vanished.

(Cars passing)

You are not like them.

I saw that.

I saw what they did to you.

Julia, I'll do
anything for you.

Whatever you say.

Actually there is something.

I think it would be good for me

To see the other two

From that night.

Well, not Piers.

I think I need
more time for him.

But the other two.

I think it would really help.

Help me heal.

(Cars passing)

(Mellow music)


[Dr. Sgundud] Love.

Weakness.

What did you think,
the two of you

Were going to run away together

And live happily ever after?

You will go to her apartment,

And see what you can
find on a certain

Adam.

(Door creaking)

Thank you, Sadie.

I need you to watch
this Piers Malone

Because something
is going to happen

With him and my patient.

(Suspenseful electronic music)

(Thumping electronic music)

Shotty, shotty, shot. Here.

This shot is for you.


(Frantic arguing)

(Intense electronic music)

Woo!

Yes, yes!

(Background laughter)

cheatin' faggot.

We're gonna have to
take care of this later.

I'll get these.

(Guys laughing)

(Alcohol pouring)

Hey Julia, you
gotta get over here,

I got something to
show ya real quick.

Save some, save some.

(Background laughter)

Oh my God.

Welcome to my special service.

Special service.

Cheers.

(Glasses clinking)

(Sinister music)

You with us kid?

Yo, make some for all of us.
Shut the fuck up.

Ever, ever again.

(Cheerful music)

(Guys screaming)


She cut out my fuckin' eyes!

(Adam crying)

My fuckin' eyes.

Who the fuck are you?

Where's Julia?
Bitch, fuck you!


Where's Julia?

Where is she?
(Adam crying)

Piers, Piers,
she went for Piers.

We sent a message to hang out.

I helped her!

God, please, help me.

My fucking eyes.

(Adam crying)

It was you.

In the cafe, with
Julia, that was you.

(Steady drum beat)

("The Mountain" by Wooden Wand)


(Echoing drum beat)

[Dr. Sgundud] Should
you, at any time,

Take matters into
your own hands,

There will be
severe consequences.

It is imperative that
you not make it personal.

(High-pitched tone)


(Metal table banging)


(High-pitched tone)

(Sexual grunting)


Get in there, get in there.

[Dr. Sgundud] It was
your little girlfriend,

Sold you down the river.

(Water running)

(Haunting music)

When I was young,
I liked to dress up

In my big sister's clothes,

Put on her makeup.

But my father, he
could never accept

That a child of his
was not perfect.

So he cut me.

My child, did I not warn you?

(Julia screams)

(Phone ringing)

She's downstairs.

[Dr. Sgundud] Tell her
we've been expecting her.

(Opera music)

We'll wait for her,

And then we will
continue this festival.

(Ominous music)

(Muffled scream)

(Ominous music)

(Muffled shouting)


Sadie.

Nadya!

Sadie?

(Loud opera music)

(Knife slashing fabric)

Did you think you
could fuck with me?

Fucking answer...
