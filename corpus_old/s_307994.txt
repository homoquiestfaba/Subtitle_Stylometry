Th is is what we cal I S.M.A. D.

Each letter stands

S for s ocial,

D for dependab le.

N ow I k now what

I am u n ique.

I do n't fal I u nder any

But we've tested it
and y ou do.

N ow, I wi I I beg i n.
I am an A.

A's are, of course,
amb itious, but,

we're als o very creative,
i ntel I igent, v is io naries...

usual ly CEO's, MVP's,
that type of th i ng.

Yes?

Yeah, u h, how d id an A I ike y ou

Yes.

These are the S's.

They I ike to talk

but they als o I ike to

Talkers.

They're not usual ly as
creative as the A's,

but if they happen to come up
with an i ntu itive idea,

they appreciate a rou nd of app lause
and a n ice pat o n the back.

Hey.

That's y ou.
That's y ou, Harry.

You're not an A y ou're an S.

Or actual ly y ou're an S with

But that's y ou.
N o, I am an A.

Harry, A's do n't

I do n't have to.

I thoug ht we j ust went o ver

S's are always

It is imposs ib le
for me to be an S.

I left my wife and ch i Id

An S wou Id never do that.

He'd j ust stand arou nd

That is such an S's comment.
I am not an S!

<i>Oh, what do y ou</i>
