[projector clicking, â™ª...]

[â™ª...]

Man: <i>Batterzog</i>...

<i>Zerylum </i>...

Two words that should convey

something but didn't.

The mystery, I guess,

of language.

Two words that might have

brought me closer to my brother

Clive, but did otherwise.

There was a time when we were

close, when it seemed anything

was possible.

That was before we were

celebrating Clive's genius,

watching him win math

competitions and before he

started speaking his language

that I didn't understand.

<i>Batterzog </i>...

<i>Zerylum </i>...

I was shut out.

[music fades]

[tv blares...]

[rock music plays in the tv
soundtrack, tires squeal...]

Woman: I thought they were
a lovely couple.

Man: Yes, they are.

[tv blares loudly from inside]

Woman: Don't tell me.

[tv blares...]

Man: How many goddamn times?

[man laughs diabolically on tv]

[front door unlocks and opens]

[remote control clicks]

Tv: ...The free swimming fish
are the monarchs of

the open waters.

Their success is due to their

mobility, their keen senses and

their relative intelligence.

What?

Mom: It's mind control.

It's nothing more

than mind control.

Son: Yeah, but...
Dad: Your mother's right.

It is, mind control.

It iS. - Mom: It is.

It's a vast wasteland.

[train whistle blows

in the distance]

[boys grunt]


[crickets chirp]

[fluorescent lights buzz...]

Man: 30 minutes to go,

gentlemen.

Keep your concentration.

[softly] Come on, honey.

[loud rock music plays...]

Dad: Well, where to

for the celebration, folks?

What if he didn't win?

What? They haven't

graded anything yet.

What if the sun didn't rise?

What if the Indians finished

above .500?

Mom: Well, where to,

my geniuses?

<i>Ne menj messze.</i>

Pardon, honey?

<i>Ne menj messze.</i>

[sighs exasperatedly]

Watch that language.

I know a diner that serves

great pancakes, Mrs. Messerman.

[general conversation]

Mom: So Sandra,

how've you been?

You were saying 12 coins,

three weighings

on a balance scale...

Right.

William, honey, are you going

to eat your pancakes?

Yeah, I am.

And you find the counterfeit,

but you don't know whether

it's heavier or lighter.

Well, right.

That's what makes it hard.

It'd be trivial if you knew

which one were heavier.

Or lighter, of course.

Of course.

William, honey, there are

people in this world who would

give their right arm

for those pancakes.

For these pancakes?

Mom: William.

All right, little brother?

Hey... get outta here... what...

no... Elliot!

And you figured this out

just now in the gym?

Clive: Right.

Well then, it oughta be

easy enough.

I've been fine, actually,

Mrs. Messerman.

Thank you for asking.

...Thank you for the ride home,

Mr. And Mrs. Messerman.

You're welcome, Sandra.

Dad: Anytime.

Clive, aren't you gonna walk

Sandra to the door?

Yeah.
No, that's O.K., I'm fine.

Thank you for the pancakes.

[shouting from inside her house]

Man inside: Shut up!
I'm not gonna pay!

That's all I'm paying, bitch!

Shut up!

You can go, she's fine.

Dad: O.K.

[â™ª...]

[lighter clicks]

[birds chirping,

children playing]

Man: So, Clive, I have

to ask, have you ever tried

transcendental meditation?

Dad: No...
Man: Well, it's fantastic...

Dad: Transcendental, that's

like, uh, that's like, uh...

Transmission [laughs].

No, no [laughs], truly...

Dad: Trans-axle meditation.

[guests laugh]

All right, first course!

Woman: Oh!

Mom: Vegetables!

Dad: Oh, look at this!

Such a feast!

Man: What food!

Wow, that's beautiful.

[laughs] Thank you.

Mom: OH. [chuckling]

Here's to having

seats together...

On r-r-rocket ship earth...


And incidentally, everyone,

here's to the new math champion

of William Howard taft
high school.

Whoo!
Yes! [whistling]

And here's to our neighbors,
the Cubanos.

Mrs. Cubano: Mmm!

[glasses clink]

And to our neighbors,
the Messermans.

Thank you for having us.

And to our next victory
in the city finals.

Mr. Cubano: You know,
the kids at school are all

pretty impressed with Clive.

I overheard some of the juniors

talking and well, [chuckling]

They think he's a genius.

Yeah, but those are

the vocational kids.

My two geniuses.

What did Einstein say?

"mathematics transforms

the fortuitous concourse

of atoms into the tracery

of the finger of...


[laughing] Wow!

Mr. Cubano: That's beautiful.

Herbert Turnbull Atchley,

not Einstein.

No, Einstein said don't worry

if you're not good at math,

because neither was he, and i,

for one, will drink to that.


What he said was, "do not

worry about your difficulties

in mathematics.

I can assure you that mine

are still greateR."

[chuckling]

Oh, oh, norm Byzantine...

<i>Lieutenant</i>Byzantian served <i>
with me.</i>

Right now, he's living,
poor fellow,

in the Napa valley...

Wow.

Here's what he has to say:

"a wistful elegy of a zinfandel,

a nearly human longing


In a grapE."

[Mrs. Cubano laughs louder

than anyone else]

No, um...

Clive?

To peace.

All: To peace.

[loud soul music plays]

Woman: â™ª Hey, it ain't easy
girls, it ain't easy â™ª

â™ª To get the man you love
satisfied â™ª


â™ª It ain't easy,
girls, it ain't easy â™ª

â™ª To keep the one you love
by your side... â™ª

[general conversation
at the table]

...That's your card.

O.K.


Clive, chanting: ...Grind,
grate, chop, purify, frappe...

[Clive's motor buzzes...]

Grind, grate, chop, liquefy,

purify, frappe, grind...

[footsteps cross the floor

upstairs]

[woman coughs]

[â™ª...]

Are you sure
you don't want any?

I can barely eat half.

Oh no, thank you,

Mrs. Messerman,

i-i'm too nervous to eat.

Please, call me Judy.

It's only Cleveland.

And he's got the counties.

It's really just the beginning,

then he's got regionals,

then the states...

It's really a long season.

And Sheshevyky'll be

at the states.

Who's Sheshevsky?

Ariel Sheshevsky.

His parents are

both physics professors.

They live in Columbus.

Now, <i>he</i>is a genius.

[sighs] Well, I guess

that makes two of them then.

Three of them,

actually, Sandra.

[scoffs] Of course,

Mrs. Messerman, three of them.

Call me Judy.

Well, I don't think we have much

to worry about.

Of course not.

Judy: Clive has

a rare strength in him.

William: So billy de Salz

and me are waiting

in the gym parking...

Billy de Salz and <i>i.</i>

[chuckling] Well, O.K.,

you weren't there,

but I see your point.

Billy de Salz and <i>I</i>are waiting

in the gym parking lot

during varsity basketball,

and this girl, jeannine Lyons,

who's a total fox but is seeing

joe Blair and everybody knows

it, is totally P.O.'d at Blair

for something and you know...

William, would you pass

the salad over this direction?

Sure.

So jeannine comes out

with billy and I while joe...

Judy: With billy and me.

All right, well, jeannine

and billy and I are hanging out

at billy's car.

Dad: What kind of car?

Judy: Wait, billy de Salz
is driving already?

Yes, his dad's continental.

So anyway, jeannine

comes out...

Carl de Salz
has a Lincoln continental?

Must this always be
about insurance?

Well, I should be handling

that account.

Well, anyway, it turns out
that jeannine's not really out

there to cry
on billy's shoulder.

As a matter of fact,

she's there to talk to me.

Clive: You sure about that?

Yes, as a matter of fact,
I am.

May I remind everybody here
that someone in the messerman

family still has to make
a living.

Was that a Mark III
or a Mark IV?

I think it was a Mark IV.

But anyway, so we're standing

out there, you know,

rapping and...

You're what?

Rapping, you know, talking.

Did it have those little oval

opera windows in the back?

Yeah, I think

that it did, dad.

But anyway,

the fact of the matter is that

jeannine plays the piano...

in fact, she's working on

the Chopin nocturne,

the same one that

I'm working on.

I'd say it's definitely

a mark iv.

Honey, your son is talking.

Anyway, needless to say,

jeannine is very impressed.

Chopin was different

than the other romantics.

He was a pole among Parisians.

But he stuck to his convictions.

You know what Schumann said when

he heard his first Chopin piece?

That's an 85... $8500 car.

You gonna eat all of those?

Hey! Hey!

He said, "hats off,

gentlemeN. A geniuS."

"beauty is another form

of genius...

Higher indeed than genius

as it needs no explanatioN."

Oscar Wilde?

[whispers] Oscar Wilde.

"it is of the great facts

in the world like sunlight

or springtime

or in the reflection

in dark water of that silver

shell we call the mooN."

And all the geniuses have

remained mysteriously silent

on the subject...

Of the anchovy.

It's a caesar.

Although anchovies,

if I recall correctly, are $1.60

a tin... thank you, Ohio mutual!

We could have done perfectly

well without the anchovies.

Clive: Right on.

Insurance is about protecting

the average person, it's about

the problems of the common man.

Why lie to your family?

[dad's knife and fork clatter

onto his plate]

Excuse me?

You know, dad, you're either

part of the problem or part

of the solution.

Or dissolved in a solution.

[chair scrapes the floor]

Yeah, the point is...

We didn't... The point is we did

not do without the anchovies.

The point is, Simon,

that your son has won the math

championship of the city

of Cleveland.

Oh Jesus, I forgot to ask

about that.

And there are people

in the world who would give

their right arm

for this anchovy.

[stifles a laugh]

Well, jeez,

that is wonderful, Clive.

Here's to the champion

of the great city of Cleveland.

[Simon chuckles]

[woman coughs]

[she coughs again]

[car passes outside]


Sandra: Damn cough.

Welcome to Cleveland.

Shhh, quiet.


What were you doing?

Nothing, I just didn't really

know what they were.

[chair thuds]

No...

I mean, what were you

doing over there?

Oh, it's my history project.

Your history project.

Yeah, it's the pieta,

Michelangelo.

It's Mary holding Jesus but he's

dead, but... It's no big deal.

Don't tell me you're really

a genius too.

Not really.

Um, were you watching me?

A little.

I didn't do anything weird,
did i?

[moving boxes, she grunts]

Nope.

Sometimes I do.

Here.


Come here, little brother.

I had to move here.

It was my only choice.

You sleep here?

Yeah.

I'll tell you another secret.

I like you, little brother.

You and me, we have

this connection, you know?

You know more

than everybody thinks.

I do?

Yeah.

I could bring you

food, Sandra!

That'd be cool, you know?

I wish Clive was as cool

as you sometimes.

I wish.

I'm really not that cool.

Yeah, you arE. [exhales]

Question.

Does Elliot ever bug you?

[chuckling] Oh, I dunno,

I mean... Not really, but...

Oh, sometimes, I guess.

Well, he bugs me.

Yeah?

Clive is so superior to him.

I mean, Clive really is a genius

and Elliot's the farthest

thing froM. [exhales]

Yeah, I hear you.

Did he ever tell you

about us?

Who?

Clive.

Did he ever tell you

about he and i?

No.

He didn't?

No.

[footsteps crossing

the floor upstairs...]

You're not gonna tell

your parents about me,

are you, William?

No... No way.

[door upstairs opens]

You're not gonna tell

anybody, not even Clive?

Clive doesn't know?

Of course, he knows, genius.

It's good practice,

keeping your mouth shut.


I get the feeling you could

use some.

All right, I'll tell ya.

I'm Clive's lover.

[she chuckles]

[water running...]

Oh... <i>Bonjour.</i>

Thank you.

Why, that's very kind of you.

Michelangelo, his pieta?

He's transformed the fortuitous

concourse of atoms

into the tracery

of the finger of god.

A pole among Parisians.


I have come to see you again.

[silverware rattles in the sink]

[silverware rattles

in the drawer]

Lover?

[classical music plays

on the radio...]

Judy: Whoa! Come on!

Simon: Get back there!
Judy: Oh!

[â™ª...]

[William laughs]

Judy: Get him! Get him!

William: Oh, he scores.

Judy: Good one, honey!

Simon: Yeah, the old man's
still got it.

[â™ª...]

[William chuckles]

What?

I dunno.

[slowly, clumsily playing Chopin

nocturne on the piano...]

First fingeR. - Right.

Thumb on the "a" so that

you can reach gently

into the octave.

This is romantic music.

[William plays wrong notes]

[she sighs]

[he stops playing]

[Judy plays the same piece

with style]

Chopin died at age 39.

This is the gift of his

suffering to the world.

So now I suffer?

The girls adored Chopin.

They did?

Mm-hmm.

Think of jeannie Lyons,

think of how this would move

her heart.

It's <i>jeannine</i>Lyons, mom.

Jeannine then.

Think of how this would

move her.

Let me ask you something.

[she stops playing]

Does your brother ever speak

that language of his at school?

Sometimes.

What do the other kids think

of it?

I don't think

they understand.

Is there some key to it,

some kind of dictionary?

Well, if there was,

he wouldn't tell me about it.

Can you multiply

275 by 5,386?

Can you do that in your head?

Can the other kids do that

in their heads?

Mom...

I made that stuff up

about jeannine Lyons.

I know that, sweetheart.

You know?

Honey, a mother knows her

children from the day

that they're born.

I know you won't understand that

for a while but I've known how

you were gonna turn out

since you were two years old.

Well?

A brilliant pianist.

And Clive?

Comedian.

No, really.

Do you know about Clive?

What about him?

I dunno, just... You know,

um, what's going on

with everything?

Is there something going on

with him?

Oh sweetheart, you're just

as extraordinary

as your brother.

Mom, please.

You don't have to be

the same, you're different.

He does things that you're not

going to do.

What kinds of things?

Just things that have to do

with who he is.

Your brother is gifted.

But with that gift comes

its own weight.

Do you understand that?

William, your brother will need

you for his whole life.

That's what it's like to be

a brother to a boy like that.

And for the rest of your lives,

you will have more in common

with each other than you have

with anyone else in this world.

Except that he happens

to be a genius.

[laughs ruefully] Maybe,

but you talk to the girls

in english.

Remember that.

[rock music plays...]

Hey...

What's happening?

You know, what gives?

Yeah, I hear you.

[music continues...]

[bubbling...]

Hold it in.

I hear you.

There are people in

the world who'd give

their right arm for that dope.

[inhaling]

So, you know this language

you guys talk?

Did you make it up or...

<i>Nem.</i>

What does that mean?

<i>Sheyteni.</i>

[â™ª...]

Do you have, like, a

dictionary or something for it?

<i>Hogyne.</i>

You know, if you ever want

someone to talk to, you know,

just get something off

your chest, you can talk to me.

You know, I know more than

everybody thinks, you know.

I'm your brother.

Good to meet you.

[â™ª...]

[tires screech,

vehicle approaches]

[door slams, indistinct voices]

William: You know I beat you

last time.

Simon: You make things up.

Service.

What is that?

What do you think

of Clive, dad?

What do you mean,

what do I think of Clive?

He's been acting a little

weird lately, don't you think?

Is that supposed to be

a newsflash?

Just thought I'd ask.

So now, what do you

think of Elliot?

Elliot is a fine kid, why?

Nothing, I'm just talking,

that's all.

What about Sandra?

What about her?

Well, what do you

think about her?

She's his belle, if that's

what you mean, but he will
get over her.

Come on.
I'm not sure he will.

I think she's actually kind

of pretty.

[scoffing] Pretty...

William...

Maybe she is, but it's

the cheap kind of pretty.

It's not the kind of pretty that

lasts... I guarantee it, sailor.

Now, service.

[calling out] Sorry!

Service.

What are you sorry about?

[ping pong ball bounces...]

[Sandra sighs]

[â™ª...]

This was the gift of

his suffering to the world.

...Hey, Sandra.

It's me, William.

Sandra?

Hey.

I was expecting you.

You brought me oranges.

Yeah, William of oranges.

Er, they're tangerines,

actually.

William of tangerines.

So, William of tangerines...

Look, I'm really sorry

about what my dad said.

I just thought it would

come out funny.

Well, it didn't.

Yeah.

That's O.K. 'cause Clive

and I have the kind of love that

your father will never

understand, that's all.

So tell me, William...

There's a whole bag of

tangerines upstairs.

I don't think anyone's

gonna miss 'em.

That's not what

I was thinking of.

Yeah, I didn't think so.

I know what you want

to tell me.

I'm just waiting for you.

I'm clairvoyant, you know.

Clive's gonna win

the counties.

No, not what I was

thinking of either.

What do you want me to say?

Is it true that you

think I'm beautiful?

[loud rock music plays...]

â™ª ...Come out, come out â™ª

â™ª Oh, you better believe me â™ª

â™ª Come out, come out... â™ª

Simon: What do you think

about this music, sailor?

It's all right.

Your brother's quite

enamored of it.

[music turns off]

Dad, my... My report

card came.

Yeah, I know.
I got a call from

Mr.. Farmer's office.

It was just
one bad semester...

Don't sweat it, sailor.

At ease.

All this business with Clive...

You know, just things he does...

the music and his language...

I want you to know that

he's just trying to understand

his life, that's all.

You understand what I'm saying?

Yeah.

I, I'm not saying what

he does is wrong and if you want

to try some of those things

some day... That's fine.

It is?

Yeah.

My generation has a lot

to learn from your generation.

Yup.

[hose turns off]

A grown man with

a purple tie.

Look at me...

Your father.

Look at me, dad, your son.

"what a noble creature

is maN."

Your old man sells insurance...

Will you ever forgive him?

Yeah, I forgive you, dad.

[sharp inhale]

[train horn honks faintly]

I just want you to know that

grades don't mean anything.

I want you to know that.

Why, I'm proud you don't

care about them.

You are?

Yeah, they're an external
symbol of approval for something

you ought to be doing for
its own sake, anyway.

Affirmative, sailor?

Affirmative, captain.

In 100 years, no one

will know about the puny trials

of our days.

"sweet mercy, how my very heart

has bled to see thee.

Poor old man...

With thy gray hairs

grow white in the snowy blastS."

It's not that bad, dad.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge,

William.

That's what important,

not your report card.

[â™ª...]

So, that's how

we'll settle it.

Chet will leave Clive alone

and won't come anywhere

near him at school.

Agreed?

Yeah.

Chet.

Yes, Mrs. Messerman.

And, Clive, you won't

do anything to provoke

Chet here, agreed?

Clive?


...What is it about this new

America that hates intelligence?

What is it about this country?

When I was a girl, we called

our teachers "professoR."

We revered them.

We all wanted to be like them.

I mean, there was no greater

achievement for us

than learning.

Now, in America,

we spit on that.

We attack it, the great

pillars of our culture:

Learning, art, beauty.

They... they might

as well be vices!

[dishes clattering]

You know what Mao

is doing in china?

Breaking up all the violins into

pieces, smashing them all up.

Maybe that's what's next here.

Maybe that's what

this is leading to.

[piano playing]

[faint chanting from outside]

[chanting continues...]

[shivering]: So...

What's happening?

We're buddhist monks.

It's Clive's idea.

Both: Ohm...

Judy: Clive,

William, dinner!

Just a minute!

Judy: Clive, William, dinner!

It's not polite to keep

our guests waiting!

[door slams]

The potatoes kind of

taste funny.

You know, what does it

mean exactly, Mrs. Messerman,

"twice baked"?

That's a good question.

Mom?

[laughs] Well, I spoon
the potato back into the skin

and bake it again.

What a great idea.

Seems awful cruel and unusual

for the potato, does it not?

[laughs] Thank you, Sandra.

And you're welcome to come by

anytime, by the way.

Thank you.

So lucky to have such

a good cook for a mother.

It's not that big a deal.

It's not?

W... No.

I mean, the potato's not

that big a deal.

You're a great mother.

It's really great having

a good cook as a mother.

Is your mother

a good cook, Sandra?

She doesn't do much cooking,

actually, Mr. Messerman.

Thanks.

Thanks for what?

Oh, thanks for asking, dad.

Oh.

You're welcome, I guess.

It's just not

really her thing.

Oh, I can understand it.

So can i.

I think we all can understand.

I think so too.

[dogs barking in the distance]

[playing Satie's "Gymnopedie
No.. 1" on the piano...]

The square root of 56,389.

[door opens and shuts]

Clive?

237 point... About four-six.

Oh, that truly

is extraordinary.

Where do you get that from?

From the back of

the sock drawer.

[chuckles] What about primes

between 900 and 950?

You know, Sheshevsky
is going to be at the states.

You think sheshevsky's
at home reading magazines?

Why do you
call him "Sheshevsky"?

You call me "messerman"?

He's just a guy.

His name is Ariel.

Simon: And the prime?

907, 911, 919, 929,

937, 941, 947.

Got it.

Look out, Sheshevsky.

[soul music plays, laughter...]

[indistinct party chatter...]

[â™ª...]

You think something
funny's going on?

Funny?

You <i>know</i>...

Oh...

That?

Dad'll never do anything.

William: He won't?

He's trapped in a cage.

Yeah, dad's in a cage.

That's right.

What kind of cage?

A cage of his own devising.


William: Cool.

[loudly strumming chords

on electric guitar...]

[guitar chords echoing

throughout the house...]



[guitar strumming continues]

I don't think that's loud

enough, Clive.

Do you think you can play

any louder, Clive?

[strumming continues]

[strumming stops]

I didn't know you understood

electronics to that degree.

I'm trying to do

some homework.

You know, some of us

have homework to do.

You know, study, books... See?

Hi, Sandra.

Hello, William.

Clive: <i>Gyanus.</i>

Elliot: <i>Hogyne.</i>

[guitar strums]

What does that mean?

[laughs]

I think it means

"once more, with feelinG."


[strumming continues...]

[footsteps climbing stairs...]

[reading gibberish...]

[stops playing guitar]

Where'd you find that?

Where'd you leave it?

Give it here.

What is it?

It's nothing!

Then why you
freaking out about it?

Fuck it!

William, give it here!

No, stop it.

Stop it, get off.

Hey, hey, hey,

quit being a brat.

All right!

All right.

Fuck you, William!

It's the dictionary.

What?

Good job, William.

We figured you'd be

looking for it.

I wasn't looking for it.

Yeah, right.
I wasn't looking for it.

It's not exactly
a dictionary.

It's more like a...

Rosetta stone.

I used to have one of those.

You did?

Look, how 'bout
giving it here.

No.
Let him keep it if he wants.

It won't do anybody any good.

Fine, I'll just keep it then.

What do you mean,

it won't do anybody any good?

He only found half of it.

He only found the words.

You didn't think that

we'd keep the meanings in

the same place...

Did you, little brother?

[indistinct chatter

and laughter...]

Judy: William!

Um, I'm coming!

I got one.

Oh, come on.

Yeah.

[indistinct chatter...]

Mrs. Cubano: ...So handsome.

Mr. Cubano: Everybody ready?

Here we go...

Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

Simon: Catch... This.

[rock song plays...]

Singer: â™ª Oh! â™ª

â™ª A-ha! â™ª

[â™ª...]

[music turns off]

Mrs. Cubano: Mmm... Wow!

Mr. Cubano: It's not bad.

Uh, it's, um... It's innovative.

It's really, um...

Sandra: [laughs] You crack
me up, Mr.. Cubano.

No, it's not bad at all.

It's, uh, it's not what
I call danceable but it

is original, right?

I'll give you that.

Oh, no, no.
No, no, no.

I could dance to this.
Play it again.

Mr. Cubano: I know

you can, honey.

Honey?

Come on.
Come on back, sweetheart.

Let Simon have the stage,
all right?

Play another one for us.

Play another one, all right?

You sit and you behave.

Simon: Yeah, O.K.

Mr. Cubano: Here we go.

Catch this.

[another rock song plays...]

â™ª Teachers, parents

and politicians,

they ridicule the wild... â™ª

[music turns off]

Well?

O.K., I like

the second one better.

I like that one.

Oh, no, no, no...

It was good... no, it was!

The first is sexy.

Sexy...

Mom, I mean, what do you

think about it?

I have values and taste.

<i>Ez nem tetseek.</i>

Pardon?

Honey, this stuff
is everywhere.

It's the future.

We may as well learn about it.

Simon, you can listen

to whatever you wish,
but there are certain things

I will never accept.

What would Chopin think?

What would Mendelssohn think?
Oh, come on.

We're not gonna talk
about Chopin.

The world's changing, honey.

We're all gonna have

to change with it.

And what did you say,
young man?

<i>Nem saameet.</i>

Judy: Pardon?

<i>Holvon o veytsey, kayrem.</i>

Clive, your mother
asked you a question.

Why don't you tell us
how you solved that problem,

the one with the, um, coins
and the scale, Clive?

I still don't understand it
at all.

He doesn't have to talk

if he doesn't want to, dear.

Yes, he does.

Clive...

Mrs. Cubano: Clive, please.

Answer Mrs. Cubano's
question.

[whispers]
Vee-sont-laa-taash-roh.

[groans] Man, I...

Now...

It's great what kids
do these days.

They reinvent <i>everything.</i>

Clive's invented a new language.

[â™ª...]

[dog barks in the distance...]

[lighter clicks]

Elliot: What a nice surprise.

DR. Livingston, I presume?

[chuckles]

I just came down here to bring

Sandra some food, you guys.

Feeding the monster?

Bite me.

Elliot: Where?

Sandra: My ass.

Elliot: You wish.

Thank you, William.

That was sweet.

William of grapefruits.

Elliot: So... Since when

has he known about this place?

Hey, don't worry, man.

I didn't tell anybody, O.K.?

Clive: Uh, who's worried?

Elliot: <i>Hazudozo.</i>

Clive: <i>Gyonyoru.</i>

Yeah, you know, um, dad says

that his generation's got

a lot to learn from ours.

I mean, he told me.

And, um, what else did

he tell you?

Well, he said that, you know,

you're just trying to understand

your life.

Clive: I hear ya.

Elliot: It's true, you know.

He's right.

We have to lead them

through this stuff.

Clive: No, we don't.

We don't have to lead

anybody anywhere.

[inhaling]: We have

to educate them.

Hold it in.

We don't have
to educate anybody.

Hold it in.

[William sputters]

Elliot: You been studying

the rosetta stone?

A little.

Elliot: <i>Hazudozo.</i>

Have you found
the meanings yet?

No, I haven't been looking.

Of course you have.

By the way, little brother,
you are dressed kind of nice.

You going somewhere?


[lighter clicks]

Judy: This is why I wanted

to bring a map.

I used to find our way in the

east china sea among Japanese

subs in mined archipelagos.

Yeah, with a map.

The test started

15 minutes ago.

Well, that leaves us

an hour and 45 minutes.

Ah-ha.

Look, he's welcome to do what

he can in the time that's left.

The others have been at it

for 45 minutes already.

That's just officious,
is what it is.

It's not fair to the others.

Look, it was my fault,

not my son's.

I forgot to bring a map.

Well, maybe next time,

you'll bring one then.

There won't be a next time

is what we're telling you.

Clive, what do you think?

Sounds fine.

O.K., quick.

Just let me get

a drink of water.

[metal clinks, water runs]

Good luck.

[door opens]

[Judy sighs]

[rock music plays...]

You guys, I can smell that

that all the way downstairs!

[Clive and Elliot laugh]

Hey, William.

I've been looking

at the rafters.

Have you ever noticed them?

They're made of all these...

Intricate pieces.

[Elliot and Clive snicker]

[William chuckles]

Clive and Elliot have...

Told me some of their words.

<i>Servoos.</i>

<i>Servoos.</i>

<i>Ablak</i>...

<i>Bayosh</i>...

<i>Birkahoosh</i>...

<i>Szer</i>...

<i>Szer</i>...Eto.

Did they tell you

what they mean?

No, not yet.

Little brother,

the old man here has just

tried his first doob.

Yeah, I don't know what

this marijuana's supposed

to do, William.

[snickers]

You tried it, dad?

Yeah, I did, sailor.

And watch out, Sheshevsky.

Here.

Take it.

[music continues...]

Dad?

[scoffs]

That's interesting.

Didn't anybody ever teach

you how to smoke a cigarette?

You didn't inhale.

Yes, I did.

He never has.

[laughs]

Do you know, your brother

won the cuyahoga county

finals this morning?

Dad, I was there, remember?

Oh...

Yeah.

Congratulations, Clive.

Thank you.

[makes kissing noise]

By the way... I dried
the lunch dishes for you.

Clive: [snickers]



Mrs. Cubano: Takes me days
to plan a meal.

William: It's really
great, mom.

Thank you.
Mr. Cubano: Now, I'm telling

you, he's a criminal.

He sent his henchmen into that

hotel and all those clowns in

his cabinet were complicit.

He's gonna be impeached,

you mark my word.

Thank you for this lovely

meal, Judy, it's so good.

[muffled]: William?

Hmm?

Can you open up that
window for me, please?

Uh, sure.

Simon, it's 40 degrees out.

[slurring] We could use some

cool air in here, could we not?

[glass breaks]


[neighborhood dog barks]

Very nice, Simon.

William, would you close

the window now, please?

Sure.

[Simon pours...]

[drunkenly] Now, let us try

the red wine.

"that is why I have come

to California, for soil

the color of a dark sea.

Too many years on ships and

you forget the taste of women...

And wine.

In the earth we shall find...

Mmm, a hidden sourcE."

[chuckles]

Here's to the champion

of cuyahoga county.

Here, here.

Mrs. Cubano: Here, here.
William: Cheers.

Simon: [clears throat]

And here's to the hidden sauce.

Source.

Yup.


My wife is... Right.

And I only have one son left.

What is that supposed

to mean, Simon?

Well, I don't know.

I'm surprised myself.

You're drunk.

Indeed I am.

But that's not alL. [laughs]

So, Clive...

Tell us what the math

finals were like.

Math is just concentration,

Mrs. Cubano.

Math is... Simple steps,

one after the next.

Each step is irrefutable...

Unassailable... Rising higher

and higher into the sky, each

stone no more than what it is.

But with such simple stones,

in time, you have built

a cathedral.

That is what math is.

It's a cathedral, and when you

have finished, you enter it in

awe and you sit beneath the arch

and you feel what human beings

have always longed to feel.

That was lovely, Clive.

["adagio in g minor" plays...]


It's me, captain.

Yeah, sailor.

[music continues...]

Is that Bach?

No, no, Mozart?
Or could it be... Haydn, is it?

It's Albinoni.

Dad, what would you say

if I had gotten myself

into some trouble?

What kind of trouble?

Serious trouble.

[music turns off]

You won't.

How do you know?

How do I know?

I just do.

Character is fate.

Heraclitus said that about

two thousand years ago.

[trash cans rattle on street,

dog barks]

What if I could change

my character?

[laughs] You won't.

That's my point.

You can't resist being

who you are.

No one can.

Expensive tastes, a raccoon

that likes anchovies.

Thank you, Ohio mutual.

[scoffs]


[Simon exhales]

Dad, what were you like

in high school?

What was I like?

Yeah, I mean,

did you get good grades?

Were you a good student?

Oh, we were

at war then, William.

Pass me my drink.

You know, in geometry, they

taught us bomb trajectories.

Uh, yes, I cared about my grades

and then I went to war.

Well, you know, grades

are just an external symbol

of something that you ought

to be doing for yourself

in the first place.

You're a quick study,
aren't you, William?

Well...

You should know
something then...

That what I said about

your grades was dead wrong.

Your grades are about as

important as anything gets.

Grades are all an employer

will have to judge you by.

You know that's right,

right, William?

I mean, you know,

don't you, that these...

These crazy times

are gonna pass.

[birds chirp]

...Why don't you two find

something to do for a while?

This could take some time.

Oh, there you are.

Math was never my subject.

Grades aren't important.

Cool.

They're just an external

symbol of something that

you ought to be doing for

yourself in the first place.

What do you think of that?

I think you're funny.

Think of Clive in there,
doing this stuff.

One of these equations
is wrong.

What?

It is, the calculations
are incorrect.

Come on.

They are.

Now, don't tell me

you understand this stuff too?

Well...

It's really not that difficult

if you understand the equations.

[chuckles] My two geniuses.

Liar.

[loud whisper] Genius.

[she crosses the floor]

William: Where'd you go?

Look, i... I mean,

I just found one small mistake

in the equation.

It's nothing.

It's probably just,
like, a typo.

Sandra: Try and find me.

Do you really think
I'm beautiful?

Yes.

How beautiful?

Very.

Your beauty is like sunlight or
springtime or... The reflection

in dark water of that silver
shell that we call the moon.

Wow.

Did you just make that up?

It's not a big deal.

But you can't even see me.

Yes, I can.

No, you can't.

It doesn't matter.

You didn't really

understand that math, William.

Yes, I did.

O.K., you're right, I didn't.

I pretended to.

I just don't really

like thinking about

that kind of stuff.

What stuff?

Equations, the kind of

stuff that Clive thinks about.

Did you lie about

anything else?

Oh, like that
I think you're pretty?

Yeah.

No.

I could never lie about that.

How am I doing?

You're getting warmer.

Nope... Colder, genius.

[â™ª...]

Good, warmer.

What do you like to think about?

I like thinking about you.

[â™ª...]

[same song plays on car radio]

â™ª Diamond girl â™ª

â™ª You sure do shine â™ª

â™ª Glad I found you â™ª

â™ª Glad you're mine â™ª

William: So how come

you're not worried about it?

Clive: How come you're not

worried about walking

to school in the morning?

Well, because I know

I can do it.

Exactly.

Put, put more arc into it...

Like that.

Math is just

different for me.

I know I can do anything

in math, that's all.

Well, that's amazing.

Do that again.

[rock clinks]

That's amazing to me.

Yeah, but there's,
like, five kids on the block

that can do that.

You know, what you do
is just so different.

But the thing is
is that it's not.

There's nothing
amazing about it.

It is just something
that I can do.

Like mom... you play an e flat

instead of an e and she can hear
that from across the street.

But is that amazing?

Is it amazing that a dog can

smell you in your footprints?

Oh, maybe not,

but every dog can do it.

Well, I guess you

got me there.

Sheshevsky doesn't worry you?

[birds chirping]

Easy, tiger.

How long have you been there?

Not long.

I was watching you.

Was I snoring?

You sleep like an angel.

William...

Have you told
your parents about me?

No way.

Are you sure?

Positive.

I told you I was clairvoyant.

About what?

About this.

I knew this would happen.

Did you ever find the rest

of their dictionary?

No.

I'm still looking, though.

I don't give up.

I've noticed.


Tell me that thing

you said again.

That thing?

That thing you said.

Oh, you mean, like, um...

That you're the reflection in

dark water of the silver shell

that we call the moon?

Huh.

Really...

That was sweet.

Oh... William, don't.

Don't ruin it now.

[â™ª...]

â™ª Hold on, freedom â™ª

â™ª Freedom's only thing

you have â™ª

â™ª Hold on, justice â™ª

â™ª Justice is your only land â™ª

â™ª I saw the meaning,

the meaning in the sun, sky â™ª

â™ª He said, "lay, lay,

you better just let it slide" â™ª

â™ª My life is for living

and living is for fun

so you better ch-change

your mind â™ª

â™ª Change your mind â™ª

â™ª Why, I've got one â™ª

â™ª Hold on, freedom â™ª

â™ª Freedom's only

thing you have â™ª

â™ª Hold on to justice â™ª

â™ª Justice is your biggest land â™ª

â™ª When they look for something,

and something looks for them â™ª

â™ª Just like a jungle,

a jungle where

you never been... â™ª

Here...

One for you, too.

â™ª And each new change means

a new day for me â™ª

â™ª So you better hold on â™ª

â™ª Hold on, you can see â™ª

â™ª Help me, now â™ª

â™ª Ooh... Yeah â™ª

[â™ª...]

Come on, little brother.

Clive: Elliot baked them.

William: Hey,
they were good, man.

Clive: <i>Kituno gomba.</i>

Elliot: <i>Sapien.</i>

Hey, I want to thank you

guys for inviting me.

Oh, no problem,

little brother.

<i>Servoos</i>!
<i>Servoos</i>!

[water lapping]

<i>Bayosh.</i>

You baked 'em too long.

[birds chirping]

[boys splashing in the lake]

[bell chiming single tone

softly...]

[crow caws...]

[tone continues, strengthens...]

<i>Servoos.</i>

<i>Servoos.</i>

How do you feel,
little brother?

[tone continues...]

I feel great.

[tone continues...]

Found out what
the words mean, didn't you?

I haven't been looking.

<i>- Vajon visszatersz, eh?</i>

[laughs, echoing weirdly]

[tone continues chiming...]

[chiming becomes harmonic...]

[harmonic chiming intensifies]

[water lapping]

I'm really hungry.

I waited for you.

Well, I guess you did.

Tell me something.

What are you gonna think of me

in 10 years?

What are you gonna think of me

when your family comes apart?

What?

Shh...

[â™ª...]

Singer: â™ª She is the day

that gives me time â™ª

â™ª To live and linger love,

my life â™ª

â™ª Till night comes on with

sundown in scythe

to end the puzzle pantomime â™ª

â™ª She's a day of lovE. â™ª

[muffled conversation, coughing]

Man: 10 minutes.

10 minutes to go,

ladies and gentlemen.

[Judy sighs]

[piano plays...]

Choir: â™ª Drifting with the

current down a moonlit stream â™ª

â™ª While above the heavens

â™ª O-hi-o... â™ª


Thank you.

As the superintendent of the

Cincinnati public schools, it is

my pleasure to award this year's

state medal in mathematics.

Hmm, this is remarkable.

I guess it's true what

they say about great minds.

Ladies and gentlemen,

it's my privilege to bestow this

year's championship medal on...

Ariel sh... Sheshevsky.


And... Clive messerman.

[applause continues...]

Boys, could you,

uh, please rise?

[shutter snaps]

It's just a math competition.

He didn't even win.

...Mom, Sandra lives

in the basement.

Boys will be boys.

She's been living

there all year.

She doesn't go home, mom.

Her mom doesn't know where

she is and she doesn't care.

She lives behind the furnace.

Poor girl.

She lives behind our furnace.

Sweetheart...

Do you think I don't know

about Sandra?

You know about her?

Of course.

I think it's kind of romantic.

Dad knows too?

No, he doesn't and I don't

think you should tell him.

Your father isn't always as...

Forward-thinking as he seems.

I want to ask you something.

She's his girlfriend, right?

You mean, are they exclusive

or something?

Yeah.

That's what I mean.

I don't exactly know.

Well, it's fine
if she lives in our basement.

[â™ª...]

[knocking, door opens]

Ping pong, captain?

Judy: Dinner's ready!

It's on the table!

Shh.

Oh...

Um...

It's you.

Serve.

[ball bounces away]

What?

[footsteps descending stairs]

Judy: Boys?

Dinner's ready.

[Elliot gasps]

[â™ª...]

<i>Batorsag.</i>

<i>Szerelem.</i>

Judy: [gasps]


Judy whispering:
Oh, my god, Simon.


Oh... [sobbing]

[stifles sob]

[â™ª...]

[grunts]

[â™ª...]

William, as adult:
Unless we speak, how can we let

someone know how we feel?

A gesture, a look,

perhaps, but are they enough?

I never spoke about that day.

I wanted to, but I never did.

That's why, I guess, nothing

changed, yet everything did.

I obsessed about it for years,

but never really had the guts

to do it... To atone.

And then, suddenly,

it was too late.


[waves crash, seagulls caw]

...Funny.

Man: <i>Servoos,</i>ladies.

<i>Servoos.</i>

Did he say <i>"servoos"</i>?

Excuse me, ladies?

Ladies.

Excuse me, ladies?

I'm sorry.
Uh, did, did you say <i>"servoos"</i>?

<i>Servoos.</i>

Uh... Where did you

learn <i>"servoos"</i>?

Where do I learn it?


Where do you learn it?

In kalocsa.

Are you Hungarian too, yes?

Hungarian?

No, I'm not Hungarian...

You were speaking Hungarian?

Woman 1: Yes, indeed.

[laughs]

<i>Servoos </i>is Hungarian.

Yes.

William, chuckling: Uh...

Can I speak with you
for just a minute?

Yes.
Is that O.K.?

Sure.
I'll be back, hon.

O.K.

Woman 1: How 'bout here?

He was very smart.

He didn't want anyone

to understand him.

It's, um...

It's difficult to explain.

I want to show you something.

This was their dictionary.

These were their words.

[reading Hungarian aloud...]

What?

This not a dictionary.

What is it?

Is a poem.

[reading Hungarian aloud...]

Can you, uh,

can you translate it?

Yes... "courage and love.

The quiet I keep on

the thin path to the meadow

is the hardest.

The sound of your talk below..."

William: "the quiet I keep

on the thin path to the meadow

is the hardest.

The sound of your talk below and

wind in the trees is an oracle,

our future now.

I'm caught beneath the tilt

of maples and cry of difference

between ten thousand things...

Leaf and stone, wind and grass,

me, you.

How could I live without you,

my love, even for an afternoon?

When the sun comes up, I open

ten thousand eyes to you.

When it sets,
I open ten thousand more.

I'm remembering and watching
you at the same time.

Do not miss me when I'm gone,
my true and only friend.

Do not even think of me.
I could not bear to know."
