Hey, Sheriff.

("Chair scraping on floor)

A Mercury is a real good car.

That was the car I was driving that day.

I have a lot of cars.

Yeah. Different kinds.

A lot of different kinds of cars.

She was standing, this girl,

on the side of the street
where there was this chicken stand.

It wasn't the Colonel,
but it was a chicken stand nevertheless.

And I pulled the Mercury right up alongside

and I rolled down the window,
see, by electric power.

And she had this leather skirt on.

And she had a lot of hair on her arms.

I like hair, I like hair a lot.
It means a big bush. I like a big bush.

So she says, "Are you dating?" You know?

I said, "Sure." So she gets in.

And we pull off
into this remote location, you know,

that was comfortable for both she and I.

And she says to me,
"How much do you wanna spend?"

And I said, "Whatever it takes to see that
bush of yours, 'cause I know it's a big one."

And she says to me, "25 dollars."

That's not chicken feed, you know...
to a working man.

So I produce the 25 dollars and she sticks
it down into her shoe and pulls up her skirt.

And there before me lay this thin,

crooked, uncircumcised penis.

You can imagine how bad
I wanted my 25 dollars back, huh?

("Girl) I don't know why you're
so weirded out. This is not San Quentin.

It's just a nut house. Most of these people
don't even know where they are.

They're not gonna hurt you.

In a few minutes, we're gonna be in a room
with a killer. That doesn't bother you?

Hey, you're the one
that wanted to major in journalism.

These are the people
from that newspaper deal.

Oh, yeah. From the college?
Yes, sir.

I'm Jerry Woolridge.
Nice to meet you.

I'm Marsha Dwiggins
and this is Theresa Evans.

She's here to take the pictures.

Y'all sit down.

Yeah, there was a young man
named John Legit Hunter

who was in the filling station business -
a good filling station business.

But he was one of these young men
we run across in life,

I'm sure you've run across 'em, who didn't
deserve what he had, you know?

And one of the things he had was this...

beautiful young bride,

Sarah.

She was a Georgia peach.

In fact, she was more like the picture I had
in my mind than any woman I'd ever seen.

So I took it upon myself
to take her away from John Legit Hunter,

who did not deserve her, you know?

Oh, I don't know if I told you,

but he was a Frenchman
who claimed to be an Englishman.

Yeah... Took a lot of strong nylon cord
to get her away from him,

'cause she was a fighter
as well as being a Georgia peach.

I think there must have been a little mix-up.

I talked to your sponsor or teacher,
or whoever he is,

and I told him that
there couldn't be any pictures.

It's supposed to be like an article or a
story, something like that, isn't that right?

Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper,
but it has pictures.

I mean, it's a regular paper, you know?

Karl's real sensitive
about having his picture made.

He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board
for the Easter collage.

Now...

a shovel just makes
too goddamn much racket.

All I can do is talk to him,
see what he says.

You gotta make something explode
to truly understand it.

I mean, you gotta examine all those little
tiny particles while they're still on fire.

("Guard) Karl, I've gotta take you
down to the old classroom.

Mr. Woolridge has some people
for you to see down there.

Come on, let's go.

You remember me telling you
about those people from that newspaper?

They wanna ask you some questions
about your release.

They think it'll make a good story.

Will you talk to 'em?
Get interviewed?

Now, they're women.
("Guard snorts.)

I think it'd be good for you, too.
You're gonna be seeing all kinds of people

when you get on the outside.

This'll help, I believe.

Now, here's the thing.
He'll only talk to you,

but he doesn't want
you to ask him anything.

And you really shouldn't stare at him.

How am I going to conduct an interview
if I can't ask him any questions?

It's the best it's gonna get. I'm sorry.

Can I ask you a question? If he's so
troubled, why are you letting him out?

What if he does it again?
It happens all the time.

He's free, his time's up.
That's the rules.

He's been treated and reevaluated
and doesn't show any signs anymore.

Signs?
Homicidal signs.

Oh, Miss. I'm sorry,
but you're gonna have to step outside.

Why?

Please?

I gotta change the light in here for Karl.

I hope you can still see to write.

I reckon what you is wanting to know
is what I'm a-doin' in here.

I reckon the reason I'm in here
is 'cause I've killed somebody. Mm-hm.

But I reckon what you is a-wantin' to know
is how come me to kill somebody,

so I reckon I'll start at the front and tell you.

I lived out the back of my mother
and father's place most of my life,

in a little old shed
that my daddy had built for me.

They didn't too much want me
up there in the house with the rest of 'em.

So mostly, I just sat around out there
in the shed, a-lookin' at the ground.

I didn't have no floor out there.

But I had me a hole dug out to lay down in.

A quilt or two to put down there. Mm-hm.

My father was a hardworking man
most of his life.

Not that I can say the same for myself.

I mostly just sat around
out there in the shed,

tinkered around with a lawn mower or two.

Went to school off and on
from time to time.

But the children out there,
they were very cruel to me.

Made quite a bit of sport of me.
Made fun of me quite a bit.

So mostly, I just sat around
out there in the shed.

My daddy worked down there
at the saw mill,

down at the planer mill
for an old man named Dixon.

Old man Dixon was a very cruel fella.

Didn't treat his employees very well.
Didn't pay 'em too much of a wage.

Didn't pay my daddy too much of a wage.

Just barely enough to get by on, I reckon.

But I reckon he got by all right.

They used to come out,
one or the other of 'em,

usually my mother,

feed me pretty regular.

Though I know he made enough
to where I could have

mustard and biscuits
three or four times a week.

But old man Dixon, he had a boy.

His name was Jesse Dixon.

Jesse was really more cruel
than his daddy was.

He used to make quite a bit of sport of me
when I was down there at the schoolhouse.

He used to take advantage of little girls
there in the neighborhood an' all.

He used to say that my mother
was a very pretty woman.

He said that quite a bit from time to time
when I'd be down there at the schoolhouse.

Well...

I reckon you want me to get on with it
and tell you what happened,

so I reckon I'll tell you.

I was sittin' out there in the shed one
evening, not doing too much of nothing,

just kinda staring at the wall,

waiting on my mother to come out
and give me my Bible lesson.

Well, I heard a commotion
up there in the house.

So I run up on the screened-in porch
to see what was a-goin' on.

I looked in the window there
and I seen my mother laying on the floor,

without any clothes on.

Mm-hm.

I seen Jesse Dixon a-layin' on top of her.

He was having his way with her.

Well, I just seen red.

I picked up a Kaiser blade
that was sitting there by the screen door.

Some folks call it a sling blade,
I call it a Kaiser blade.

It's got a long wood handle,
kind of like an axe handle.

With a long blade on it
shaped kind of like a banana. Mm-hm.

Sharp on one edge and dull on the other.

It's what the highway boys use
to cut down weeds and whatnot.

Well, I went in there in the house,

and I hit Jesse Dixon upside the head
with it, knocked him off my mother.

I reckon that didn't quite satisfy me.

So I hit him again with it in the neck
with the sharp edge

and just plumb near cut his head off,
killed him.

My mother, she jumped up from there
and started hollerin':

"What did you kill Jesse for?
What did you kill Jesse for?"

Well...

Come to find out I don't reckon my mother
minded what Jesse was a-doin' to her.

I reckon that made me madder
than what Jesse had made me.

So I taken the Kaiser blade,

some folks call it a sling blade,
I call it a Kaiser blade,

and I hit my mother
upside the head with it.

Killed her.

Some folks has asked me:

"If you had it to do over again,
would you do it the same way?"

Well, I reckon I would.

Anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here,
and here I've been for a great long while.

I've learned to read some.

Took me four years to read the Bible.

I reckon I understand a great deal of it.

Wasn't what I expected in some places.

I've slept in a good bed
for a great long while.

Now they've seen fit to put me out of here.

They say they're setting me free today.

Anyhow, I reckon
that's all you'd need to know.

If you wanna hear about more details,
I reckon I can tell 'em to you.

I don't know whether or not that's enough
for your newspaper or not. Mm-hm.

("Marsha.) Will you ever
kill anybody again, Karl?

I don't reckon
I've got no reason to kill nobody.

Where will he go?
Anywhere he wants to.

I think he's going back to Millsberg,
where he's from.

It's just about 20 miles from here.
Will he be supervised?

As much as anybody else is, I guess.

Y'all have a real nice rest of the day, now.

I'll get Melvin to walk y'all out.

Melvin, could you
walk these girls out, please?

Thank you.

Thank you.

I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
to looking at purdy people. Mm-hm.

I guess you will.

I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
to them looking at me, too.

Better go get your things.

I ain't got nothing but them books.

Better go get 'em.

All right, then.

All right, then.

Can I help you, sir?

Can I help you, sir?

I was kindly wanting
something or other to eat. Mm-hm.

Well, what would you like?

You got any biscuits for sale in there?

No, this here's a Frostee Cream.
We don't serve biscuits.

We got a lot of other stuff, though.
What you got in there that's good to eat?

Well, we got Big Chief burgers,
Bongo burgers, Footlongs, Corny Dogs,

Frostee Shakes, Creamy Bars.

Did you want me
to go through the whole list?

Reckon what do you like to eat in there?

Well...

The French fries are pretty good.

French-fried potatoes?
Yep, French fries.

How much you want for 'em?

Well, they're 60 for the medium
and 75 for the large.

I reckon I'll have me some of the big 'uns.

All right, then. One large French fries.

These darn things are heavy.
Hard to carry, too.

What you got in there, wash?
Yeah.

Ain't you got no mom and daddy
to tend to it?

I got a momma. She's at work
over at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

Daddy's dead.
He got hit by a train.

How far are you going
with them sacks full of wash?

Half a mile, I think it is.

I can help you tote it
if I don't give out first.

OK, but you don't have to.

All right, then.

My name's Frank Wheatley.
What's your name?

Karl's my name.

What's your last name?
Childers.

What are all them books?

All different ones.

One of 'em's the Bible,
one of 'em's a book on Christmas,

one of 'em's on how to be a carpenter.

Why do you carry them around with you?
I ain't got no place to set 'em down.

Don't you live somewhere?

Did live up there in the state hospital.

Why did you live there?
I killed some folks quite a while back.

They said I wasn't right in the head, so they
put me there in the nervous hospital

instead of putting me in jail.

They let you out?
Yeah.

How come?
They told me I was well.

Had to turn me loose.

Well, are you well?
I reckon I feel all right.

This here's my house.

You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.

We can just set these bags on the porch.

All right, then.

You like to play football?

I never was no account at it.
I never did get picked out for it.

Well, me and the Burnett twins
and some boys play

at the junior high school field all the time.

If you wanna play, you can come on over,
'cause we ain't no good either.

Well, I'll see you later.
All right, then.

Karl.

Hon, you can't just go in there.

Karl, what in the world are you doing here?

I wanna come back and stay in here.

You can't do that.
You're a free man.

They let you out
so you can do as you please.

I reckon I don't care nothing
about being a free man.

I don't know how to go about it. Mm-hm.

Well, you're gonna have to learn.
It'll take some time.

Don't you have anybody down there
to help you out?

No, sir.

Well, your daddy was living down there
the last time I heard.

I guess he wouldn't want
to help you out any, would he?

Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

Don't you have anybody?

No, sir.

Never did know too much
of nobody down there.

Not to be helping me out no way. Mm-hm.

Look, Karl, the truth is,
I don't know where they expect you to go,

and I don't know
what they expect you to do.

If it was up to me, you could
come back here and stay if you wanted to.

I'm just trying to do my job.

You follow me?

Listen, Karl. I know an old boy
who's got a fix-it shop deal in Millsberg.

He used to go to church with me.

You're good working
on small engines and things.

If I was to put my neck out for you with him,

do you think you could work it
if he'll hire you?

I'm pretty handy, I reckon,
on lawn mowers and whatnot. Mm-hm.

I know you are, I've seen it myself.

Could you give it a try?
I reckon.

Now, I...
I can't promise you that he'll hire you.

I'll have to tell him about your history.

I never was no good with history. Mm-hm.

No. I mean your past.

Why you were in here.

I'll take you down first thing in the morning.

You don't have anywhere
you could stay tonight at all?

No, sir.
Well, you can't stay here.

It's against the rules.
If something was to happen, I'd be liable.

I reckon I can just walk around
till morning time.

And sit and read a book somewheres.
Mm-hm.

Karl, would you like a muffin?

No, thank you.

I understand Jerry's gonna take you
someplace else tomorrow.

I don't reckon I know nobody named Jerry.

She's talking about me, Karl.
That's my first name.

He's carrying me to look for work down
in Millsberg, where I was born. Mm-hm.

Would you like some coffee?

Coffee makes me a mite nervous
when I drink it.

Daddy, can I be excused to go to bed?

Sure, honey.
You sleep with your momma tonight.

I'm gonna sleep with your brother,
so Karl can have your room.

Why?

'Cause he's company.

Well, Karl, looks like you got
plenty of blankets and things.

Bathroom's out there in the hall.

We'll leave at first light.

That's a... that's an old cowboy thing.

Jerry, why didn't you give him Bubba's
room? His sister's is a little girly, isn't it?

Yeah, I thought about that. I guess it
doesn't make any sense to move him now.

Daddy...

Don't you think one of us ought to stay up
all night and kind of guard or something?

Well, hell, no, son.
What's wrong with you?

He's a nut, ain't he?
"Isn't," Bubba. Don't say "ain't."

("Knocks at door)

Karl, are you up?
Yes, sir.

Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl?

You been sitting there like that all night?

Yes, sir.

Well, come on.
We'd better hit the road.

All right, then.

Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
Hey, Bill.

Good to see you, man.
It's been a long time.

It's good to see you, too.
How's everybody doing?

Oh, pretty good. Kids are driving me crazy,
Phyllis is gonna put me in the poorhouse,

but I can't complain other than that.
Wouldn't do any good if I did.

You know Scooter, Jerry?
I don't believe I do.

Good to meet you, Scooter.
How about you?

Well, this is him, the one
I was telling you about on the phone.

Like I said, if you get nervous about it,
I'll understand.

I'm not gonna lie to you. He did get
into that trouble, but then he was young.

I remember that real well. He cut those
folks to pieces, his momma was one of 'em.

Yeah, and that old Dixon boy.

Oh, hell, I always wanted to kill him myself.
Asshole's what he was.

I remember that old boy, too. Kind of
retarded or something back in school.

Well, seems like he's
pretty well-adjusted these days.

He... I don't think he'd ever hurt anybody.

He don't look much like he would.

You say he fixes small engines
like nobody's business?

He's a regular whiz.
It's all he's done since he was a kid.

Are you scared of him, Scooter?
No, I don't guess so.

Can he talk?
Oh, yeah.

Now, you say he can stay out the back?

Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'm
gonna take it out of your pocket anyway.

Oh, he won't steal. He's a pretty good
old boy, really. Keeps to himself.

Well, I got a roomful of work for him to do.
I can't get Scooter to do any of it.

Karl, come over here.
I want you to meet your new boss.

This is Bill Cox.

He runs the place. Says that you
can work here and stay out back.

It's good to know you, Karl.
Thank you.

Karl, it's minimum wage,
and there ain't nothing back there

but an old army cot and a toilet.

Yeah, that'll be fine. Karl, I'm gonna
go out to the car and get your books.

All right, then.

Karl, they say you're a whiz
on fixing lawn mowers and things.

I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Mm-hm.

We order up from the Frostee Cream
at lunch, usually.

We can buy you lunch
till you get on your feet a little.

I like them French-fried potatoes. Mm-hm.

Yeah? Me, too.

They make a good double meat burger.

All right, then.
I'll see y'all later.

Karl, you done a good day's work today.
They was right about you.

Scooter, he gonna knock you out of a job
if you're not careful.

All right, then, I'll see y'all tomorrow.
Wait up. I'll leave with you and lock up.

Karl, there's a blanket up in under that cot

and some soap in the bathroom
for cleaning up with.

Now, there's one more thing. The way we
lock these doors, you can't get out at night.

You didn't wanna go anywhere, did you?
I don't reckon.

If it works out, maybe we'll get you a key
so you can get out at night if you need to.

I'll see you later.
All right, then.

So then the old man says, "At my age,
I'd rather have the talking frog."

We'll see you, JW.

Scooter, did I tell you the one about
the two old boys pissing off the bridge?

I don't remember.
Well...

These two old boys hung their peckers
off the bridge to piss.

And one of the boys was from California
and one from Arkansas.

Old boy from California says,
"Boy, this water's cold."

Old boy from Arkansas said,
"Yeah, and it's deep, too."

Get it?

That's a good 'un.
That is a good one.

You know, I do believe
you've told me that one before.

I've heard that one a bunch.

A long time ago.
Yeah, that's a classic.

You know, Karl,
I got to thinking about it last night,

and it's just not Christian of me
not to let you have a key.

I mean, you've been in lockup so long,
you don't need me keeping you locked up.

You need to come and go as you please.

Here.

Take this key.
It'll get you in and out of here at night.

All right, then.

Them French fries good?
Yeah, they're good all right. Mm-hm.

You got any money?

Well, they give me some
when they turned me loose.

I spent up some of it a-ridin' on the bus
and eating French-fried potatoes. Mm-hm.

Well, I'm gonna pay you today
for this coming week

so you have some walking-around money.

When you get off this evening,
you need to go buy some toothpaste

and some cleaning up supplies
to have back there.

Get you some magazines
and some hard candy.

Something to keep you busy at night.

All right, then.

I'll let you off while it's still daylight.

Hey, there.
I thought I heard somebody on the porch.

Wasn't your name Karl?

Yes, sir, it is.
Your name's Frank.

Yeah. What are you doing by here?

You said for me to come by.

You wanna play ball with us?

I ain't no good at it.
I just come by to see you. Mm-hm.

Well, I was going to see my momma
over at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

She works two till eight.

All right, then.

You wanna go with me?
You can meet my momma.

I oughta not worry your momma
with company.

Aw, come on. You'll like her.
She's real nice.

And she'll give us anything we want her to.
Candy or something.

Well, I was kindly needing
to do some trading.

Reckon they sell toothpaste?

Yeah, they sell a little bit of everything.

I won't tell her about you
being in the state hospital for killing.

Come on, let's go.

You're just gonna have to learn to live
without all that grease.

Shoot, not here in the South.

I like grease on everything.
I like fried chicken, fried okra.

Biscuits and gravy.
It'll kill you.

Hey, Momma. Hey, Vaughan.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?

I bet I know. You want
a whole bunch of candy and a pop, right?

Yeah.

That stuffs gonna rot your teeth, don't you
know that? I got something even better.

I just put potted meat on special-four cans
for a dollar. They're not moving very well.

But I tell you what, I'll give
a couple of cans for free to the right kid.

I don't like potted meat.

Daddy used to say they was made
out of lips, peckers and intest...

Frank, don't talk that way.

Who's that strange-looking man
behind you? Did he follow you in here?

Can I help you, sir?
("Frank) Oh, that's Karl.

I met him at the Laundromat.

Karl, this is Momma and Vaughan.
Vaughan's the manager.

He lets Momma off any time
she feels like it, 'cause they're best friends.

Nice to meet you, Karl.

Pleased to meet you.

Frank, why don't you
come back here with me for a minute?

I don't think I've seen you here before.

No, sir, I don't reckon you have. I don't
believe I've ever been in here before.

I don't believe this store used to be here.

It's been here 17 years.
You live here before, or something?

I was born and raised here
up till I was 12 year old.

What brings you back?

What's that you say?

Why are you here now?

They turned me loose
from the state hospital. Mm-hm.

Is that right?

How long are you gonna be staying here?

Mr. Woolridge, he got me hired on
to work for Bill Cox's outfit. Mm-hm.

You have family here?
Not to speak of.

Hey, Karl. Guess what? Momma said you
can stay over with us out in the garage.

Our car won't fit in there anyway.
It's real neat.

Frank told me about your situation.
Frank loves company.

You know, especially after
his daddy passed an' all.

There ain't no sense in you staying
in that old greasy shop.

He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
He just got out of the state hospital.

I know.
Can we get some candy and pop?

Sure thing. Go ahead.
Come on.

You think it's safe
to let him around that guy?

Frank's just crazy about him.
He likes the way he talks.

He helped him carry home
the clean laundry.

He's been in the state hospital a long time.
There must be something wrong with him.

He's retarded's all.
You know he's always after a father figure.

Lord knows,
Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.

What about me?
I don't think he sees you as a "guy" guy.

Oh, Karl's a "guy" guy?

This is what I call my secret place,

'cause I come out here
when I feel like being by myself.

I used to come here with Karen Cross.
She's kind of like my girlfriend.

Or used to be.

We used to come out here
and hold hands and talk,

and read books to each other
with a flashlight.

She didn't want to have
nothing to do with me in front of people,

'cause I don't have any money.
Well, Momma and me, I mean.

See, her daddy's a dentist, so they're rich.

Was your folks well off?

No, we didn't have too much. Just barely
enough to scrape by on, I reckon.

They still around, your folks?

My mother's dead. My daddy,
he's supposed to be around still.

But he don't wanna have
nothing to do with me.

How do you know?

Well, he never did want to. I figure
he probably ain't changed his mind much.

How did your momma die?

You don't need to hear things like that.
You're just a boy.

You need to think about good thoughts
while you're still a boy.

There's plenty of time for all the other.
Mm-hm.

I've had a lot of bad thoughts
since Daddy died.

Sometimes I wish I was still real little
and he was still here.

Momma's real good,
but I wish I had both of 'em.

We went to Memphis in the car one time.

It was raining so hard,
we couldn't see the road.

But I wasn't scared,
'cause as long as Daddy was driving,

I thought nothing could happen to us.

That's the way I feel about Momma now.

Momma has a boyfriend now.
His name is Doyle Hargraves.

He works construction,
so he makes a pretty good living.

But he still don't help Momma out
with any money, though.

He ain't no good.
He's mean to her.

He don't like me at all.
Momma says it's 'cause he's jealous,

'cause I belong to my daddy instead of him.

He spends the night over at our house
sometimes, and he's got his own house.

Somebody told me
it's where he can have more girlfriends.

I like it on the nights he ain't at our house.

I ain't so nervous then.

How come her to still be girlfriend
an' all with him if he mean to her?

She says it's for the times
when he's good to her.

She's lonely since Daddy died.
Sometimes she says she don't know why.

He threatened to kill her
if she ever left him.

My daddy would kill him if he was still here
and somebody was mean to Momma.

Vaughan, he's real good to Momma.
Vaughan that you met.

But he's not able to do anything to Doyle.

He's funny, you know.
Not funny ha-ha, funny queer.

He likes to go with men instead of women.

That makes him
not be able to fight too good.

He sure is nice, though.

He's from St. Louis. People who are
queer get along better in a big town.

I wish he liked to go with women.

I'd rather him be Momma's boyfriend
than Doyle.

Karl, you know when I told you
Daddy got hit by a train?

Yes, I recollect that.

It ain't the truth. He shot himself
with a shotgun on purpose.

How come he would do that, reckon?

'Cause he didn't have enough money
to take care of us the way he wanted to.

That's what the letter said. He got laid off
at work and started working odd jobs.

I thought he took care of us just fine.

Karl, did you really kill somebody?

Yes, sir, I did.
Who did you kill?

Two people.
Were they bad people?

I thought they was.

Well, maybe they needed it.

Well, I growed up and learned
that you ain't supposed to kill nobody.

It's all right
if you're looking out for yourself.

If it's self-defense.
Was it self-defense?

My daddy was good.
I think too many good people die.

That's what I think.

Karl, are you sure you wanna
go stay with these folks?

You're welcome to keep on staying here.
It's working out real good.

That boy wants me to.

All right, then.
I'll see you bright and early.

How are you coming along
with that garden tiller?

I fixed it.
It's working pretty good now. Mm-hm.

You done fixed it? Well, I'll be damned.
Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed.

Of course, Scooter's about as shiftless
as one poor son of a bitch can be.

You done fixed it.
Well, I'll just be damned.

Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
All right, then.

I don't guess I give a shit, 'cause,
I mean, I ain't here that much anyway.

If you want a retard living out in the garage,
I guess that's your business.

Of course, I do got some tools out there
and a set of sockets

I'd rather not have stole.
I could take those home with me.

He's real honest.
He wouldn't steal nothing.

Now, Frankie,
I wasn't talking to you, was I?

Huh?
No, sir.

"No, sir" is right.
I was talking to your momma.

This is her decision, not yours. If I let it
go on, it's 'cause she asked me, not you.

Hey, is this the kind of retard that drools
and rubs shit in his hair and all that?

'Cause I'm gonna have a hard time
eating around that kind of thing, now.

Just like I am
about antique furniture and midgets.

You know that. I can't so much
as drink a damn glass of water

around a midget
or a piece of antique furniture.

Doyle, you're awful.
You shouldn't be that way.

I ain't saying it's right.
I'm just telling you it's the damn truth.

Now, he'll make me sick. I know it.

What was he in the nut house for?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.

Mm-mm. No, no. He had to go nuts
and did something, now.

Come on. There's a lot of retards running
around ain't locked up in the nut house.

Think about it, Linda.

You know what he done, Frank?
I ain't sure.

Yeah, well,
you might oughta want to find out.

He might have hacked his family to pieces
with a hatchet or something.

Yeah, that's right, Frank.
You better ask him.

I mean, don't hurt his feelings or anything,
but it'd be good to know.

I'm sure it's nothing.
He seems real sweet.

You're all hung up on people being sweet,
aren't you?

He's sweet, everybody's sweet.
Speaking of sweet, where's your girlfriend?

I thought you said
he's coming over here for something.

He'll be here in a little while.
He's taking me to get an ice cream.

Ain't that sweet.
What am I gonna do about supper,

while you're out running around
with that fag?

You're not crippled.
Get in there and make something.

Talking back and everything, aren't you?

That kind of makes me horny, Linda.

Frank, why don't you go off and play in
your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty?

I don't wanna go play in my room.
He don't wanna play in his room, baby.

Just let him sit here.
Let's all just be a family.

Till your mentally retarded friend
and your homosexual friend get here.

("Footsteps.)

("Vaughan.) Karl?

Yes, sir.

So you're really going to stay here?

That boy, he wants me to.

Have you knocked on the door yet?

No, sir, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?

Quite a spell, I reckon.

Listen, Karl.
Before you get very used to staying here,

I think you and I need to talk about
a few things. Can I take you to lunch?

I done ate just a little bit ago. Mm-hm.

No, I mean...
I mean tomorrow, or the next day.

I reckon I could use a little
something or other to eat at noon time.

Bill Cox, he generally gets me a box lunch.

But I reckon he can
lay off of doing it tomorrow. Mm-hm.

OK. Well, then, I'll come by Mr. Cox's
and pick you up around noon, all right?

All right, then.

There's your girlfriend.

Hey, y'all come on in.

Come on. Have a seat in here.

Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Oh, tolerable, I reckon.

Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.

Frank, why don't you and Karl go on
out in the garage and fix him up a place?

Play a game or something.
Vaughan, you ready to go?

Sure, I guess.
Hey, honey, don't rush everybody off yet.

Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?

Aw, I don't want to.
Me and Karl's got things we need to do.

Hey, Vaughan. You know what I heard?

I heard you been putting it on old Albert
Sellers, works over at the funeral home.

I know Albert. We're friends.
No, I heard you's more than friends.

Yeah, I heard Dick Rivers come in
and caught the two of you all bowed up

and going at it right in the same room
with poor old Miss Olgetree,

and her dead as a doornail,
laid out on a gurney.

That's ridiculous. That is just a total lie.
Let's go, Vaughan.

Frank, we'll be back in a little while.
I'll bring you back something.

And your food's in the oven, warming over.

See? You fixed him something, didn't you?

Hey, Vaughan.
I was just going on with you.

Just joking around, you know, buddy.
I know that. You're a real card, all right.

So, Karl, come over here and sit down.
Talk to me.

Come on, Karl, let's go to the garage.

Goddamnit, I wanna talk to him.

You sit down, Karl.

So what's in your bag?

Mm... This and that.

Toothpaste and whatnot. Mm-hm.

What's all them books?

Different ones.
One of 'em's the Bible. Mm-hm.

You believe in the Bible, do you, Karl?

Yes, sir, a good deal of it.

I can't understand all of it.

Yeah, well, I can't understand none of it.

This one begat that one, and that one
begat this one, and begat, and begat,

and lo and behold, someone says
some shit to someone or another.

Just how retarded are you?
Stop it, Doyle.

Frankie, you be quiet.
We're talking. The adults are talking.

So was you in lockup for cutting
someone up with a hatchet or something?

I ain't never used no hatchet
that I remember. Mm-hm.

So you're just crazy
in a retard kind of way, then, huh?

It wouldn't matter to me
if you did do violence on somebody.

I ain't scared of shit.

You think I'm scared for you to stay here?

You're just a humped-over retard,
it seems to me.

I'm just kidding you.
Welcome to our humble home, buddy.

See, Frank here needs
all the friends he can get.

Frank's a weak little kid.

His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.

Stop, Doyle.
Don't talk about my daddy.

("Mocking.) "Don't talk about my daddy."

Go on, get outta here.
Go on out to the garage, leave me be.

Go on.

Come on, Karl.

Frankie?

Don't say nothing about
our little spat to your momma, now.

I don't want her worrying about your ass.

I'd like to kill that son of a bitch.
I hate him.

You oughta not talk thataway.
You're just a boy.

Well, I hate him.

He oughta not talk thataway
to you neither.

He ain't no account,
if he's mean to you and your momma.

Your momma and that fella that's carrying
me to get something or other to eat

going to be back directly.

Will you be here with us for a long time?

I reckon, if you want me to.

I got some of that potted meat and
soda crackers left over, if you want some.

I don't see how you can eat all that stuff,
with them insides it's made out of.

Well, I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.

I like the way you talk.

Well, I like the way you talk.

You think it's really
got peckers in there, cut up?

Hey, you know better than that.
You oughta not say that word.

Well, it smells kinda funny.
It's a little loud.

Looky right there. I believe you're right.
I believe I see one right in there.

Mister, reckon you can hand me
some of that mustard over there?

Thank you.

OK, Karl, the reason
that I brought you here

is to talk to you
about something that's on my mind.

I'm just... I'm just gonna
put it right out on the table.

Where do I start? Um...

Linda and Frank
are very important to me.

They're like family.

My own family was never like a family.
They're horrible people.

As a matter of fact,

for years I prayed every night
that my father would die,

and finally I realized
through a lot of therapy

that I was wasting
my energy on hating him.

So...

now I just don't care.

But, you see, you and I are a lot alike,
as strange as that may seem.

I don't... I don't mean physically,
or even mentally, really,

but, well, emotionally.

Actually, the hand
that we've been dealt in life.

We're different.
People see us as being different, anyway.

You're... well, you've got
your affliction or whatever,

and I...

well, mine's not as easy to see.

I'm just going to say it.

I'm gay.

Does that surprise you?

That I'm gay?

You know what gay is, don't you?

I don't reckon.

Homosexual.

I like men.

Sexually.

Not funny ha-ha,
funny queer. Mm-hm.

Well, that's a very
offensive way to put it.

You shouldn't say that, Karl.
You were taught that, weren't you?

I've heard it said thataway, yes, sir.

Anyway, it's hard to live gay -
that's the right way to say it -

in a small town like this.

I've wanted to leave many times, but...

because I love Linda, Frank,
and a certain other person,

I...

They've kept me from leaving.
Look, anyway, I'm rambling. The...

If you're going to live
in the Wheatley garage,

you... you need to know
it's not going to be easy.

Doyle is a monster.

Not just a closed-minded redneck,
but a monster.

A dangerous person.

I've told Linda that one day that man
is going to hurt her and that boy.

Maybe even kill them.

I see it in his eyes.
I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic.

But Doyle is going to make your life hell.

There's... there's one more thing.

It's none of my business
why you were in the state hospital.

Everybody has something in their past.

Maybe...

you tried suicide,

maybe you did something... terrible.

But what I see before me

is a gentle, simple man.

All I want you to promise me...

is that you are capable of being
around Frank and Linda. You know.

You would never hurt either one of them
under any circumstances, would you?

I wouldn't never hurt them.

That's what I thought. OK. Look, I'm sorry
if... if I've offended you in any way.

You seem like a thinker, you know.

You seem to always
be deep in thought.

Tell me something.
What are you thinking right now?

I was thinking I might wanna take me
some of these potatoes home with me.

Oh. How about before that?

Let me think.

Before that I was thinking

I could use me another six or eight cans
of that potted meat, if you got any extra.

("Doyle.) Frankie, get some more salad.

Hold your plate up for me, Frankie.

I'm just gonna reach. So,
how come Karl won't eat here with us?

I don't know.
He said he'd eat out there.

I wouldn't let it get to you.
Put some of this dressing on it.

No, no.
Yes.

I just feel sorry for the poor thing.

Who the hell could eat with him making
all that goddamn racket in his throat?

It's raunchy.
He does make some funny noises.

Well, I like the way he talks.

It sounds like a racecar motor idling.
It makes me not be nervous.

Well, I'm glad of it, honey.

What have you got to be nervous about?
You're a damn kid.

You ain't got no bills to pay.

You got no business to run.
You don't even have to have a job.

You got no old lady
eating on your ass all the time.

Well, I don't know.
I just stay nervous.

Could I have some of that ham?
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

Thanks.

You know what, by God?

What?

I know what I'd do tonight.

Oh, please, Doyle, don't.
Mm-hm. Yeah.

I'm gonna call up Morris and have him
get the band together. We'll have a party.

Party our asses off.

I'd love to show them that damn Karl.
They'd get a kick out of him.

You know they would.
Please, now, not tonight.

I'm just not up for it. They always stay
till morning. I'm just give out, Doyle.

You don't gotta do nothing, Linda.
Just put some chips in a bowl

and run ice out to us
when we look low.

Last time you got mad and run Morris and
them off, told them to stay away from here.

That ain't none of your business, Frank.

Besides, that's the way
friends do one another.

Fuck it, I'm calling 'em up.

Linda, go out there in the garage
and get my guitar.

It's out there with that loony tune.
Now?

Yeah, now. I'm calling 'em up.

Hey, Morris.

What you doing, boy?

Where's Randy and them?

Yeah, now, please.
Frankie, go help your mom.

When are we gonna eat?
Hang on.

You eat when you come back.
Go get my guitar.

Come on, sugar.

No, I wanna get together.

Yeah.

Well, call him.

("Linda.) Knock, knock.

Karl, now, listen.

There's gonna be a party tonight
over here at the house.

Doyle's invited his music-playing buddies
over to get liquored up, pick fights

and make a bunch of racket
out on the patio.

It's on. We're gonna rock.

Hey, Linda, call up Vaughan
and get him over here.

I want him to be here.
I wanna show him a good time.

No, Doyle. Vaughan don't
wanna come to a party with you.

Too late, Linda. I already called him.
He's coming, or I'm gonna go get him.

Hey, Frankie.

Take that tub, and you and Karl come out
here and help me ice down some beer.

Karl, help him get that tub.
Come on, Frankie.

Come on, Frankie.

("Doyle.) Go ahead
and kick her off. Johnson!

Here we go. One, two,

one, two, three, four.

("Shambolic playing.)

You gotta play through it.

When we're on a gig,
you gotta play through it. You gotta...

No, you play through it on a gig.
Did you like that, Vaughan?

Sure. It sounds like
a number one hit tune, all right.

How about you, Karl?
Karl, did you like that?

I reckon.
("Man.) I wish you'd all lay off for tonight!

I can't hear myself think with that racket.
Hey!

("Man.) Well, it's nighttime. You let...
Hey!

("Man.) I'm calling the police!
I told you three times already.

The law's on my side.

I play cards with JD Shelnut,
chief of police,

so kiss my ass,
you old bastard!

Hey, Linda.

You and Frank clean this mess up for us,
and put the tarp over these instruments.

Me and the boys are gonna go down to the
county line. We're out of liquor and beer.

Hey, Karl, come along with us.
Vaughan, come on.

Oh, no, I don't think so.
It's late. I-I have to work tomorrow.

Don't be a pussy, Vaughan.
We all gotta work tomorrow.

Come on.
("Linda.) He don't want to, Doyle.

Don't go, Vaughan, if you don't want to.
You'll wreck, Doyle. You're drunk.

Uh-uh. I ain't gonna wreck, honey.
Come on. I'll be good, I promise.

I love you, sweetie.

Come on, Karl, go with us.

I'm just trying to make these two
feel like they're part of it, baby.

Come on, Vaughan. This'll be fun.

Hey, Karl, let's go. Come on.

You better lay off that tambourine.
Hey, man, I ain't doing nothing wrong.

Hey!

Ain't anybody gonna come and get me?

Not that you two afflicted son of a bitches
would know anything about this,

but you're sitting in
a crew-cab dually pickup.

In some circles, this is considered
a piece of automotive art.

Are you sure you can drive?
You've really had a lot of alcohol.

When you've been drinking as long as me,
Vaughan, you build up a tolerance.

Hide that between your legs
for me, will you?

Hey, Freddy. How about you?
How about you, Doyle?

How you doing, boy? Hey.

I saw your picture in the paper,
catching that big ass bass.

Yeah, she was a big 'un.

Boys.

Hello, Freddy.

Freddy.

You ain't drunk driving,
are you, Doyle?

Yeah, pretty much.
("Freddy.) I figured.

You be careful with that cripple in the back,
now. You're liable to throw him out.

Looks like you got a wagonful.
Uh-huh.

We ran out of something to drink. I'm
headed over to the county line to get some.

You wanna race?

You know better than that, Doyle.
We're on duty.

But I'll catch you
next week with that 327.

Yeah, you'll try.

What exactly are you talking about?
I don't understand.

("Man.) Exactly the point,
my young levelheaded friend.

I don't get it.
Well, I rest my case.

Morris is real smart
with philosophies and things.

That's why him and me
is the songwriting team of our group.

See, I come up with the good tunes,
or melodies as we call 'em,

and, um, Morris is the lyrics.

Not unlike Gary Brooker
of the Procol Harum.

We don't ever play any songs
that y'all wrote.

I ain't heard one of 'em.
Y'all just talk.

We don't even play any songs
with words at all that I remember.

We ain't got no fucking microphone.
We ain't got no speaker set up.

We wrote one last night
outside the minimart,

and, um, Morris called it
"Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."

And then, like in country songs,
you know, in parenthesis it says:

"There's usually
someone in the trunk."

And, um, I came up with a tune,
just a-hummin'.

See, you don't wanna
question a genius, Vaughan.

Morris here,
he's a modern-day poet,

kinda like in the olden times.

Yeah. I got a new tune.

This composition's entitled "The Thrill."
Goes something like this:

"I stand on the hill

"Not for a thrill

"But for a breath of a fresh kill

"Never mind the man who contemplates

"Doing away with license plates

"He stands alone anyhow

"Baking the cookies of discontent

"By the heat of the Laundromat vent

"Leaving his soul..."

Then, like in poetry, I go dot-dot-dot,
you know, kinda off-center,

then I drop down, and then I go:

"Leaving his soul parting the waters

"Of the medulla oblongata of..."

("silly noise.)

"...mankind"

A damn good song, weren't it, Doyle?
You like that song? All right.

I don't think that's right.

I believe the dot-dot-dot
come between "medulla" and "oblongata."

Well, it did.
The dots are where I say they are.

Melody and tune -
that's your trade, Terence.

You're a tunesmith.

I don't understand
the meaning of the words.

If y'all don't shut up,
I'm gonna go outta my mind.

Besides, Karl here's liable to bust a spring.
He's already off balance.

That wasn't the way you made it up before,
Morris. That's all I know.

We don't need no fancy words. I mean,
we need to practice. We need to rehearse.

I'll tell you what we need.
We need some paying gigs.

We don't need this messing around,
first on one patio and then another.

That's ridiculous.
Amen, Johnson.

We don't got no goddamn band!

We don't need
to fucking practice, Randy!

We don't need
a shit-ass manager neither.

You motherfuckers!
Y'all just a bunch of losers!

I'm the only sane son of a bitch here!
Just get the fuck outta my house now!

It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.

I'll whip the dog shit outta you, Vaughan.

I will fucking kill you
if you talk to me again.

Now, all of you, get the fuck out now,
before I get too mad to turn back.

What about our instruments?

Come here, you little prick.
Come here, you fucking prick!

Get out! All of y'all!

Now, get the fuck out!

Come on, you motherfuckers!

Get the fuck out!

Randy, you tooting son of a bitch!

Go fucking practice, Randy!

Come on, Morris, you fucking genius,
get the fuck up and get the fuck outta here,

goddamnit!

This ain't right, Doyle.
There is something wrong with you.

Get the fuck out!
Nobody wants to take this shit, man.

Dots look good on paper.

You don't sing 'em anyway. You're just
showing your true Aries color now.

Stay outta my goddamn face,
you fucking buzzard.

Hey!

I said, get outta my house!

That goes for cocksuckers and retards.
Now, get up off your asses and go.

Come on!
This is not your house, Doyle.

This is my house,
and I'll say who stays and who goes.

You got a house. Why don't you go get
one of your girlfriends and go home to it?

You know better than to talk to me
like that when I'm hurting, Linda.

Don't make me knock the piss outta you.
Don't you touch her.

That's funny, Vaughan.

Linda, go to bed,
and take little snot nose here with you.

You're not staying here tonight.

Go get sober before you come back.
I'm tired of my child seeing this.

Now, you get your ass straight,
or I'll lock your ass outta my life for good.

If you even think about leaving me,
Linda, I told you,

I'm gonna kill you deader than a doornail.
That might be better than this.

All right, I'm a witness.
I heard you threaten her.

Hey! You get the fuck out now!
Leave!

Don't tell me what to do, Linda.
Leave!

Don't tell me what to do, Linda.
Leave!

Don't tell me what to do.
Leave!

Don't you tell me what to do, Lin...

Don't do that, Linda.
I'm calling the police!

Goddamn you, you little prick!
("Shouts incoherently.)

Go home!

Jesus!

Hey! Goddamn you, Frankie.

Get away from us!
Goddamnit!

God!

Get away from us!

All right.

OK.

I'm gonna leave now. Fuck me!

Fuck me!

I'm gonna go home and sober up.

Go on, then.

Everything's bothering me.
I'm hurting, Linda.

I love you.
Well, I hate you!

I hate you, you little prick!

No, I don't. No, I don't.

I love your momma.

I just...

I can't explain what goes on.

You bunch of freaks,
I hope you have fun.

I'll call you tomorrow.

I'm sorry, honey.

I said I'm sorry, Linda.

OK.

All right, you can kiss my ass.

And if you ever hit me again,
you little bastard,

I swear to God I'll make you sorry
your daddy ever squirted your ass out.

You hear me?

You all right, Momma?
Yeah, I'm fine.

Let's just try and forget about tonight.

We don't need to think
about bad thoughts, do we, Momma?

No, honey, we don't.

I'll make some coffee,
start cleaning up this mess.

Karl, you want some coffee, hon?

Coffee kinda makes me nervous
when I drink it. Mm-hm.

What are you doing up again, Frank?
You need to get a little sleep.
