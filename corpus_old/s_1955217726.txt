What's the matter?

What's the matter?

Bulb must be out.

-Do you have me?
-Always.

-Can you see anything?
-Yes. Remember the stairs?

No. I don't remember
anything about this house,

except that I don't like it.

What are you talking about?
This is a great place.

No, it's cold,
and it's so dark.

You'll light it up, princess.

-Yeah, right, especially now.
-Don't say that.

Look, I'm bearing
the burden here.

All right?

This is all my fault.

Everything's my fault.

I just wanna disappear.

I can't leave
everything I've built.

We'll stay here.

We'll figure it out.

Come on.

Get ready for bed.

You'll feel better.

I doubt that.

Helen,
what you have is temporary.

-You keep saying that.
-Everything will pass.

The feelings will pass too.

I know they will.

You'll wake up day,

and the past will become
more distant until one day...

I'll never
forget what happened.

-You will.
-I won't.

Some day, you'll see.

You'll realize that
it wasn't your fault.

Take these.

Help you sleep.

<b>DEN OF DARKNESS</b>

<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

Princess...

I'm leaving.

-I have to go to work.
-Where are you going?

I won't be late.

No. No, I can't be alone.

You won't be alone.
Rosa will be here.

-No. Who?
-My old housekeeper.

I called her.

She'll stay with you,
take care of things.

No. I want you.
I want you.

-Don't go.
-Rosa will be here.

Anything you need.

Hey, stranger.

Morning, Leela.

-When did you get in?
-Last night.

Are you staying
or just checking the place?

Probably be here for a while.

Good.

Why don't you stop in later?

I gotta get to work.

'Kay.

Bye.

Buenos dias, señora.

-Have you seen my scarf?
-I'll find it, señora.

So, have you ever taken care
of anyone like me before?

I mean, this is temporary

but...

I take care of lots
of people, señora.

I clean.
I cook.

Great.

Señora, Mila, my cousin,
he got runned over by a tractor.

Both the legs
caught off, no good.

And I take care of him.

Wonderful.

He's good now, señora.

Mila, he find better work

with no legs
than when he was complete.

He find a job in computadoras

in big company.

No problem.

No problem, señora.

I get it.
It's okay.

It's okay.
Señora, it's okay.

I clean it.
I clean it, señora.

I clean it.
It's not broken.

It's no broken, señora.

Señora, it's okay.

It's okay, señora.

You'll be okay, señora.

It's okay, señora.

Breathe.

And again.

And one more time.

Her vitals are fine, Arthur.

Psychosomatic?

Well, the symptoms are real

but she is responding
to some stimulation,

which is a good sign.

She told me
she could see some shapes

on occasion, some light.

But nothing clear.
I'm sitting right here.

Of course, darling.

You're acting
like I'm not sitting here.

I'm just trying
to explain the situation.

Derrell was kind enough to come
over, given the circumstances.

But I can answer
my own questions.

Then please tell him.

Things are dark
and hazy and unfocused.

I don't know.
It fluctuates.

The prognosis isn't clear.

You may see again,
and you may not.

It's hard to say.

I can't see a goddamn thing.
All right?

Won't you just tell me
what this thing is, please?

Helen, you are...

Although clinically your vision
is considered low,

your exam results
are inconclusive.

Right now, with your vision
acuity as it is,

you're considered legally blind.

Now, I understand that
it's hard to live with,

but you just need to accept it
and move on.

It's not the end of the world.

There are some great programs
for the visually impaired.

-Rosa!
-Helen, calm down.

Do not... You told me
this thing was gonna pass,

and now you're saying
that it's gonna last forever?

-What happened?
-Princess, you...

Don't princess me.

Get me out of here, Rosa.

-Si, señora.
-I didn't mean to be harsh,

but right now you'll just
have to live

as though you'll never
see again.

Shut up, okay?

Do you hear me?

All of you doctors are the same.

You say you know everything.

But when it counts,
you know nothing.

There's a step
in front of you.

Good.
I'm sorry, Derrell.

Sometimes she just
acts like a child.

It's to be expected.

She's had a hard time of it.

We only do what we know.

Listen, call me
if you need anything, Arthur.

It's okay, señora.

It's okay.

You're gonna be okay, señora.

It's okay.

Come on! Come on!

Hold on.
I'm right there.

Okay.

No!

It's okay, señora.

Portfolio favor, señora.

Please don't move.
Don't move, señora, por favor.

-I'm blind! I'm fucking blind.
-It's okay, senora.

I help you.
No!

I help you, señora,
put some more.

I'm worthless.

I can't even do my makeup.

No. No, I call a doctor.
I call a doctor.

What can they do?
What... what can he do?

Señora.
It's okay.

It's okay.

I don't know what to do.

-I'm being punished.
-I messed up really bad.

I really was stupid.

I was.

Well, I wouldn't be
too worried about it.

I'll come back any minute.

So, look, if you'd
change for me, okay?

-All right.
-Thanks.

Yes?

All right.

No, it's okay.

I will be home
as soon as I can.

Okay. Let's see
what we have here.

There she is.

I'm blind, Arthur.
Is this some kind of joke?

Come on.

We'll have a nice dinner, relax.

Nothing's changed for me, Helen.

You're still
my beautiful wife, you know?

Can I tell you how you look?

You have gorgeous shoulders,

a long graceful neck

like a swan.

Will you put one in my hair?

You win.

I'll get ready.

Can't wait.

-Honey, did you see my scarf?
-No.

Last I saw it,
it was on the end

table.

Arthur?

Is that you?

Arthur?

Is that you?

Not quite ready!

I think
there's something up here!

Don't come down.

I'm almost finished.

Damn it, Arthur!
There's something up here!

One more minute.

What are you doing?

There's something in the
wall. I just heard something.

What are you talking about?

-I just heard something in...
-I didn't hear anything.

-I could've sworn I did.
-It's probably the wind.

Come on. I made us a feast.

You look wonderful.

-I did my best.
-You're perfect.

Come on.

It's your favorite.

Have as much
as you want, princess.

There's plenty.

You're just so beautiful, honey.

Here's something else,

something you want.

-What is this?
-A little something.

What is it?

It's an outfit for bed.

Is this for me or for you?

It's from
your favorite store.

What does it look like?

It's pink and...

-It's silky?
-It's very nice.

Try it on.

Okay.

Still too soon?

I just need a little bit
more time.

I know.

-I love you.
-Me too.

-Is Athur here?
-Un momento, por favor.

Señora, it's a señora here,

a visitor.

It's just me, my dear.

Well, I was not expecting
to see this.

-What?
-I came to see Arthur.

Who are you?

-Excuse me.
-I am Leela.

I live next door.

Didn't Arthur tell you about me?

No.

And apparently he didn't
tell you about me either.

Must have forgotten
we were married.

I'm Helen.

Well,
you know how men are.

They're all pigs when it comes
to thinks like that.

You know, that's why us women
have to stick together.

Sure.

You seem upset, darling.

How's your day going?

My day?

Well, besides being blind

and tripping
over everything, really good.

I don't know.

I just wanna know
if I'm ever gonna see again.

I don't know
how you feel about this.

I know we just met,

but I can read the cards.

-Cards?
-Yes.

What, do you mean
like tarot cards?

Okay.

I'll go get them.

Cut.

Interesting.

What?

According to the cards,
you will see again, my darling.

I will?
Well, when?

When does it say?
Look at me, Leela.

I can't keep living like this.

That I can't tell, because
the cards never tell time.

Well, this is a waste.

No, it's not.

Because here says that you need
to accept your moment,

learn your surroundings.

Well, no kidding.

-I gotta go.
-No. I'm sorry.

Please don't.
Please stay.

I'll make you a cup
of tea or something.

I'd love to, darling,

but the energy here's really
getting heavy.

It is bad, isn't it?

It's almost like...

I don't know.
It's a dark presence.

I know!

This place has been in
my husband's family for years,

but I had to go somewhere.

I had to get
away from everything.

It's not it.
I'm reading something else.

It's a spirit of a child.

Does that make any sense to you?

It was a little girl,
and she died.

And it was my fault.

Still not it.

This is a spirit
of an unborn child.

Did you have an abortion?

-I can't have kids.
-Sweetie.

It's gonna be okay.

You'll see better than before.

I know it.

Until then, you need to live
like if you won't.

Okay?

It will only benefit you.

You'll be fine.

-Good, señora.
-Si,.

Yes, yes.

That's what therapy
tells you to do:

mark the room.

Okay.
Walk.

One, two, three.

Abre. Open, open.

Open. Close it.

Close it.
There you go.

Okay. We're gonna do it again.

Turn around, turn around.

Good.
One.

Two, three, four, five.

Open.

Keep closed.

-New document.
-New document opened.

My name is Helen.

My name is Helen.

-Save document.
-Document saved.

-Close document.
-Document closed.

Four, five!

Touch.

One, two.

Step slowly.

Remember if they big.

Uno, dos,

tres, cuatro.

Feel the grass.
Feel the grass. Okay.

Now, they're complete.
That's it.

That's it. No more.
No, no, no.

Stand, stand, stand.
Go to the concrete.

Then down.
Then down.

Then down, then down.

Feel the water.

Feel the agua, the agua.

Stand.

Rosa, can you get that?

-Darling!
-Leela.

I was just listening to that CD
that you made for me.

Have you seen Lovey?

I can't find her anywhere.

She's such a bad dog!

I haven't seen Lovey.

But then again, I don't see
much of anything these days.

-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

It's a figure of speech.

But, I haven't heard
from her either.

She's the only thing
in my life I can count on.

You know, I mean,
I go on dates, believe me.

The latest, well,
what a piece of work.

Take you to Paris
on one weekend.

And on the other one,
he stands me up for dinner.

Really? Who am I
to take such behavior?

I think he's seeing
someone else too.

I mean, it's not
like I ask him to be exclusive.

It's just, he should be honest.

None of them are.

They all have their little
deep, dark secrets.

Is Arthur like that too?

I hope not.

Well, I carry on too much.

If you see Lovey,
please be a dear

and let me know.

Yeah, of course.

The little devil,
worrying me to pieces!

Don't worry.
She's gonna come back.

Are you okay, darling?

If you see Lovey, call me.

You remember,
just press the nine.

Okay, I gotta go.

Six twenty-three p.m.

Six twenty-four p.m.

The time is...

The time is 6:24p.m.

What's that?

It's a talking watch.

You program it
and it tells you the time.

It's kind of hard
to know what time it is

when it's always dark.

Can't be that dark
with your natural glow.

What is this?

It's a bear.

You got me a bear?

Yeah, it's supposed
to be a surprise.

Honey, that's really sweet.

That's me.

-Are you coming?
-Be there in a minute.

Lovey!
What?

Leela's dog!

-What are you talking about?
-Come on. Leela lost her dog.

I think I hear her.

Come on.
C'mon.

C'mon.

Lovey!

-What are you doing?
-Lovey!

I know you're in here, baby.

Come here!
Come here!

Come here!
Come here!

-Jesus...
-My gosh, what're you...

Told you I heard her.

I knew it.

Baby.

How'd you get in here?

How did you know?

I told you that
I heard something.

What is this?

It looks like a dog toy.

No. This is a doll.

Leela's a strange bird.

She came by the house again?

-You two buddies now?
-Yeah.

She seems to be
very fond of you.

She's just...

She's lived here a long time.

I've seen her around when I came
by to work on the place.

Here, we need to get you home.
Mommy's missing you.

Here.

Take that.

Don't forget the doll.

Come on.

I love the bear.

What have you and Leela
been talking about?

Just girl stuff.

Don't worry about it.

Yeah.

Don't let me go!

-No, no, no! No, no, no...
-What is it, honey?

It's okay.
It's okay.

It was just a bad dream.

How could I let that happen?

She shouldn't
have been wandering off.

-I have to get some water.
-I'll get it for you.

No, I have to do it myself.

-But you're upset.
-I'm okay.

Arthur, I told you
that I can do it myself.

Is anybody out here?

Arthur?

Easy.

What are you doing?

-I heard something.
-Again?

Come on. Let's go to bed.

No, I heard it.
It was right...

I heard...
Stop!

There is nothing out here.

I took the dog back.

You could've really
hurt yourself this time.

-Believe me, I did.
-Look, I just...

I think you're just making
too much out of nothing.

Okay? You have to let it go.

It was an accident.

I left you some extra money.

Go out. Get a massage,
or go on a picnic.

You need to relax.

I'll see you later.

This was Arthur's idea.

Si, señora.

You y el doctor
have a very nice property.

Well, as long as I'm out
here, will you tell me

what I'm missing?

The trees, the grass...

The usual things.

-Describe it.
-We have sun.

We have the flores.

Señora, all is good.

I bring you the food now.

Tell me about the birds.

No. No birds.

Donde, aquí.

Maybe one over there,

a black one.

Just one.

Ay, señora.
I'm tired.

I sit.

Rosa?

Hey.
Rosa.

How long have you
known Arthur?

I'll tell you if you tell me.

Que tal?

Deal.

I don't know.

Whenever he needs something,
he call me.

How often does he come here?

Your turn.

Well, my father was ill
for a couple of years.

And Arthur was his doctor,

and used to come
by the house once a week

to check on him.

-Sometimes...
-Sometimes what?

Sometimes he come,
sometimes he go.

Does he ever
bring anybody here?

Where's your father?

He died 2 years ago.

And then Arthur and I got
married right after that.

I don't know, Señora.

I never see anybody.

I just clean.

Rosa, do you ever hear
weird noises in this house?

Rosa?

-Sometimes...
-You do?

What kind of noises?

Sometimes I cannot
find things.

Do you think that maybe
this house could be haunted?

It's late, Señora.

Let's go inside.

I have to do the laundry.

Y el doctor likes
all of his shirts to be ironed.

He likes things
the way he likes them.

Si, vamono.

Up.

There's a pool in front.

Slowly.

Good.

-What is this?
-It's a doll.

This is Lovey's doll.
What's it doing here?

I don't know.

Maybe he drop it?

Nobody told me
he brought it back.

I don't know, señora.
Maybe he drop it.

Vamono.

Hi, honey.

Hey. You look good.

Did you get out
like I told you?

I did.

I found something.

You said that
you brought it back to Leela.

I don't know.
I guess I forgot.

I got a lot on my mind.

You know, patients,

you and what you're
going through...

-But I handed it to you.
-I don't know.

I guess I forgot.

Well, we need
to give it back to her.

The dog's going
to come back for it.

Okay.
I'll take it back later.

No.
You need to call her right now.

Okay. I'll call her.

Okay. Put it on speaker.

She's not home.

-Hi, there.
-Leela!

Yes, it's me,
but I'm not here.

So you know what to do.

Guess she's not home.

We'll try again later.

It's my doll.

Arthur, where are you?

-What happened?
-My god.

I saw a little girl. No.

-It was just a dream.
-No. No, she was here.

I was awake.
I was not in bed.

-You were sleepwalking.
-No. It was real. It was real.

Helen, you have got
to stop this.

-No. No, you...
-You're going insane...

-No...
-And you're driving me crazy.

-Why don't you believe me?
-You're upset.

-No, I'm not.
-You need to calm down.

No! I saw her!

-I'll get you something.
-No, I don't want anything!

It was real!
Please, no.

I don't want anything.

No, no, no, no.

Please.

-Sit...
-No, no...

-And wait for me here.
-It was the girl.

She was here.

She won't let me be free.

Put it in your mouth
and swallow.

-No, I don't...
-Do it, or I'll do it for you.

-It happened.
-I know.

That's a good girl.

-When's it going to stop?
-When you forgive yourself.

Now, lie down.

How can I forgive myself?

I was such an idiot.

Trying to take care
of a bunch of little girls

when I can't even be a real mom.

You were just
trying to give back.

I was playing with dolls.

Just get some sleep,
princess.

You'll feel better
in the morning.

Doll... The doll.
She took the doll.

No, no, no. Lie down.

-She did. She took it.
-Get some rest.

That's a good girl.

Good morning, señora.

You sleeping late today.

El doctor, he left.
Did he say anything?

He say he want
me to wash the patio.

-No, I mean about last night.
-No, señora.

Mira. These come for you today.

-Is there a card?
-Si, señora.

Tenga.

-Well, what does it say?
-No, señora.

No, no. My English
is no good for reading.

-No, no, no...
-Talking, yes,

pero reading, no.

-Please try.
-Okay. I try.

"For gift, you silly Helen.

I love you.

Arthur."

I take this.

I think this has all
been a lot for him too.

Don't you think?

I don't know, señora.

Mira.

My mother always say that
if you do something

to make your husband sad,
make him a nice dinner.

He forget about everything.

-Let's do it.
-Yes?

Vamono.

Hola, señora.

I'm setting the table.

-I think we need some wine.
-El doctor has wine.

-Where is it?
-In the basement.

He keeps wine
in the basement?

When the boxes come, I just
put 'em in the front door.

He likes to put
the wine there himself.

Good.

Will you take me down there
so I can see what we have?

Is this it?

-Si, señora.
-Well, open the door.

No, señora.

El doctor say to me
never to go in.

I don't want to do something
to make him upset with me.

Okay, fine.
I get it.

I'll be the bad girl.

Rosa?

-What happened, señora?
-Nothing. I just got scared.

Let's go, señora, before...

Let's go.
You know what?

You go.
You go.

Okay.

No! Call Arthur work.

Doctor Boto's office.

Hello?

Can I help you?

Hello?

This was really nice.

I'll get us some more wine.

-That's not necessary.
-It's not a problem.

I can just get more
in the basement. We have plenty.

-No, really. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

-Yeah. Yeah.
-I just thought...

That's fine.

Are you still in
love with me?

What kind
of silly question is that?

Do you sleep with me
at night?

What are you talking about?

Are you sleeping
in the basement?

What?

I found pillows
and blankets down there.

-This is absurd.
-Well, then what's going on?

What's that stuff
doing down there?

I don't know.
This place hasn't been lived in

for a long time.

Maybe someone came in,
a squatter.

But you've been down there.
You've put away wine.

How could you not notice that?

Maybe I stored some stuff
and forgot about it.

What's the difference?

I thought you were
moving on, Helen.

I thought that's
what this dinner was about.

It was.

Something's not right.

You're not right, Helen.

I've had enough.

And you sit there.

And maybe...

Good.

Now, wait.

Everyone's going
to get their turn.

The tea's almost ready.

Who's been good?

You're being very good,

sitting straight and quiet.

You can have your tea.

Careful, it might be hot.

Dolly, I have something
special for you.

It's a surprise.

Introducing Teddy the bear.

Doctor brought us a new friend.

He's so good when he tries.

Teddy, meet Dolly.

Well, how do you
do, Mr. Bear?

Very well, thank you.

Please, call me Teddy.

He's a pretty cool bear.

Right, Dolly?

Yes.

I love teddy bears.

I started to worry, though,

when you brought
that woman here, Agnes.

You don't need
to worry about that.

Doctor said
she means nothing to him.

Besides, she's blind, useless

and going cuckoo,

he said.

But what if she stays?

Then I'll take care of her.

Now, let's stop
this boring conversation.

Doctor said he's
going to bring us

something really special
for our tea parties.

What is it?
What is it?

It's a real bell
to call for tea.

Hooray!

Let's cheer for the doctor.

Hip hip hooray!

What's the matter?

-I'm just thirsty.
-Everything okay?

Yeah.

You don't look
so good, Helen.

We have to do something
about these nightmares,

put an end to them.

Yeah, they have to stop.

Let's get back to bed.

I think I'm going
to take a bath.

You really need...

Yeah. Yeah, I need to relax.

Whatever you need.

You okay in there?

I'm fine.

You need me
to turn on the water?

No, I got it.

Let me help you.

-I'm okay.
-You sure?

I'm just going
to be a while, okay?

Just get some rest.

The time is 11:31.

Rosa?

Rosa.

Call Rosa.

Rosa, where are you?

Why aren't you here?

He told you not to come?

No, no, no.
That's not true.

I need you here.
Can't you get a bus?

Or... Okay, forget it.

Come tomorrow, okay?

Call Leela.

Leela!

Something's going on.

No.
What's the matter?

What's wrong, sweetie?

I need to have you look
in the basement for me, okay?

Okay.

Why?

There's something strange.

Strange?

What do you see?

Wine.

-No. What else?
-Nothing.

What about blankets
and pillows and stuff like that?

What are you talking about?

This is a basement.

It's full of boxes.

But it was here.
I know it was.

-Are you sure?
-Yes. I'm sure.

Of course I'm sure.

So, you're saying
you think I imagined it?

I think the mind
is a funny thing, darling,

especially after trauma.

Believe me, I know.

My friend, Susie, she had
this brain thing going on.

She could swear
she was Diana Ross.

No, no, no.
I felt it.

I heard a little girl, okay?

She was talking
and she was playing.

It was so real.

I think
you should tell Arthur.

-No.
-He is a doctor.

No. He's just going
to try to put me

on some kind
of drug or something.

That's what he thinks,
is that drugs fix everything.

But they don't,
and they didn't fix my dad.

Honey, relax.

Arthur used to come
to my house every week

to check on my dad,
always saying that the drugs

he was giving him
were making him better.

And then, 2 years later,
my dad died.

I think you should
give him a chance.

It's also a stressful time
for him too.

Maybe.

Sweetie, I gotta go.

I have this big showing
this afternoon.

But I can come back later
if you need me.

Do not worry.

Relax.

Everything's going to be fine.

Helen?

Honey, I'm home.

What are you doing downstairs?

-What are you doing home?
-I came home early.

I wanted to spend
some time with you.

Well, I don't.

That was a joke.

Funny.

I'm going to change.

Did you fall?

-No, I just...
-What are you doing?

I just... What is this?

Nothing.

Come on.

We've had such a time.

I know it's been hard.
I want to make it up to you.

-No, I'm fine.
-I'm taking you out.

Get dressed.

I'm...

You know, I'd really
rather not, Arthur.

It'll be fun.

I'm going to take a shower.

You get yourself
all prettied up.

Aren't you getting ready?

Yeah. I'm almost ready.

You look amazing.

You would never keep anything
from me, would you?

Let's not get too deep.

Let's just go.

No, I don't really
want to go anywhere.

Can we just order something in?

It'll do you good.

You've been inside too much.

-Please?
-Okay.

You're just funny as all.

That's just a little bit more.

What a year.

This whole year.

Nothing...

-What was that?
-Just an animal outside.

No, something just
broke in the kitchen.

-Yeah, somethin' broke.
-No. Arthur, somebody's here.

It's nothing.

It's nothing.

Let's go upstairs.

Will you put that outfit
on for me?

Are you coming?

Come on, already.
I'm waiting.

Looking for the dog again?

No. I just fell.

Okay.

One last toast.

To a new start.

What's wrong?

I don't know.
I think I had too much already.

Well, one more.
It's good for you.

The wine's good, isn't it?

I have to call Rosa.

Now?

I have to make sure
that she comes tomorrow.

Why did you say
you dismissed her today?

Have you seen my phone?

We don't have to do this now.

We can call her tomorrow.

Wait. So why did you...

I think I need to lay down.

That's a good idea.

Lay down.

Have some more wine.

Get some rest.

No. I just want to rest.

Okay.

You get some rest.

I'll be back.

She stays, or I stay.

She stays.

I stay.

She stays.

I stay.

She stays.

I stay.

I will stay in this house.

You promised you'd get
rid of her soon.

She's done.

Trust me.

Drink some milk.

Stop it!

Drink some milk.

Now eat the cookie.
No.

Do you want
to go back to that place?

I got you out of there.

I can send you back
to that hell.

Is that what you want?

You will stop
making these noises.

You will stop
appearing in places

that you do not belong.

You will stay in the cellar
like a good little girl

until I have figured this out.

You love me
more than her, don't you?

Of course I do.

I love you the most.

You just have to listen
to what I say.

After tonight, it'll just
be you and me.

I'm tired of hiding.

I love you.

Promise me you'll do as I say.

Promise.

I love you too, princess.

We have to find her.

Helen, darling,
where are you?

You can't hide from me.

-Lila.
-Hello?

Hello? Hi, there.

-Hello?
-It's Helen. I...

-Helen?
-Helen?

Hello?

Doctor?

Is that you?
Doctor, she's here!

She's here!

Listen to me.
I'm not going to hurt you.

I'm not going to hurt you.
I have a secret to tell you.

I have a secret to tell you.

Quiet.
I swear.

The doctor's not good, okay?

-Shut up!
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Okay.
Okay.

So the bear,
the bear, the bear,

it was for you, wasn't it?

Wasn't it?
But he gave it to me.

You had to come get it,
didn't you?

What's your name?

Agnes.

Agnes, what the doctor's
doing to you...

He's sick, okay?
He's really sick.

He got close to me
when I lost my dad

and I needed someone.

Now, I'm no good
for him anymore.

He's just gonna do
the same thing to you.

-He loves me!
-No, stop it!

You have to believe me.

He's going to hurt you, okay?

You're right.

I'm prettier than you.

That's why he loves me more.

He says my kisses
are like strawberries.

He calls me his princess.

-Of course he does.
-We don't need you.

We'll get rid of you.

He can't be trusted, okay?

He lies.
You're the liar.

Did he tell you
that we're married?

No. He's married to me.

At your age, you should be
playing with other girls,

not thinking
about being married.

He saved me
from the foster home.

I don't want to go back there.
They're so mean to me.

I'm going
to help you find another place.

You can't even help yourself.

Agnes, you have
to trust me, okay?

We have to get out of here.

Helen?

Darling?

-Hey, handsome. Busy?
-Yes, very.

I came to see Helen.
Where is she?

-She's out.
-Out?

She just called me, sounded
like she needed some help.

What the hell
are you talking about?

Take a chill pill, mister.

She probably just
wanted some girl talk.

Sure.

I think she's taking a shower.

No problem.

I can wait.

Fix me a drink?

No.

Do you want to join me?

You know, Arthur, you should be
playing with girls your own age.

Doctor, I found her!

-Hey!
-She's in the bedroom.

I found her.
Not now!

That's a very
dangerous-looking knife.

I was just doing something
in the kitchen.

-Who's the girl?
-My niece, visiting.

Isn't she a little princess?

My name's Agnes.

And I'm not his niece.

I'm his wife.

Shut up, Agnes.

Go play.

She's funny.

What the hell's
going on here?

She's a spoiled brat.

She's not actually my niece,

just a girl
trying to help out.

She's from a broken home.

Helen, where are you?

Get out of my way, Arthur.

I told you she's busy!

Are you out of your mind?

Helen?

You know what?

I'm calling the police.

-You're not calling anyone.
-The hell I'm not!

Doctor!

Where did you say Helen was?

Forget about this bitch
and answer my question.

Get back here, you little slut.

Helen, I know you're in here.

Come out, my darling.

I won't hurt you.

The time is 11:31 p.m.

Time's a-ticking.

Time to face the music.

You have been running
from one thing

or another all your life, Helen.

Time to be free of all that.

There you are.

I've taken care
of you, haven't I?

You didn't have to do anything,
just sit there and be pretty.

Isn't that what you wanted,

a knight in shining armor

to take you away
and put you in a castle?

Doctor, Teddy
wants to say hi.

-Now, I got you both.
-Leave her alone, Arthur.

You did it to yourself, Helen!

You fucking did it to yourself!

Arthur, do whatever
you want to me.

But do not hurt her.

Hey. Don't do that.

Wait. Stop.
Don't go that close.

Hey. Don't do that. Stop.

When are they going to stop?

When you forgive yourself.

Helen!

Pull me up!

Helen!

-Don't let me fall!
-Don't let me fall!

-You looked pretty today.
-So do you.

I like that pink ribbon.

Got you!
