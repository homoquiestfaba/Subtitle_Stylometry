I'm six months
from retirement.

What've you fucked
up now, Combs?

We got a problem.

The man you're looking
for is not out there.

What are you saying?

Mohamed Fadawi.

We took him into
custody three weeks ago.

So my men have been risking their asses
running through them fuckin' mountains

for months
chasing a ghost.

It was top
secret, John.

Where is he?

What the fuck?


How does it feel?

Huh?

You know what
we're capable of?

I am the humble
servant of Allah.


You, fuck.

Give us the information.

How does it
fuckin' feel?

Hey, Slab.

Hey, Colin, what's up?

Goddamn engine.

Got it held together with
safety pins, toothpicks.

You heard
any noises?

Like what?

Like people screaming.

Have been hearing all kinds of
weird shit for a couple of days now,

but I keep my nose down
and mind my own business.

You killed hundreds of
innocent women and children.

You. You've killed hundreds
and thousands of my people.

You are terrorists.

Ah!

Abu Ghraib. That's a paradise
compared to this, asshole.

Hey, hey, hey.

Take your hand off me.
What's going on here?

<i>None of your business.</i>

Got to speak to your
officer in charge.

No can do, pal.
You get lost.

Hey, Colin.

<i>You ever wonder why
we're out here?</i>

<i>This is a fucking
museum ship.</i>

Have you been to
the exhibition room?

<i>This thing's gotta be
over 50 years old.</i>

She floats, right?

Those guns, they can't
protect us from deadly squad.

There's something
going on.

<i>[muffled metallic noise]</i>

What the hell
was that?

Collin, did you
hear that?

See, that's the shit I'm talking
about. That's what I'm talking about.

Relax. I'll
check it out.

You stay here.

<i>[alarm goes off]</i>


<i>[man shouting]</i>

<i>[shooting]</i>



About four hours ago, I got a
distress signal from the ship,

and we lost
all communication.

I need you to go out there
and see what the hell happened.

General, I did a boarding
party on this ship

back in 65.
Did you know that?

This piece of shit should
be razor blades by now.

<i>Actually, it was
a naval museum</i>

recently commissioned to the joint
project for the CIA and the ONI.

It's a floating
Abu Ghraib prison.

I need a plumber, John.

Why do I smell fish?

Your son's on
that ship.

Why would he be
on this ship?

<i>Probably applied
for the detail.</i>

He doesn't volunteer
for anything.

Why would he be
on this?

Maybe he wants to
impress his father.

I doubt it.

What's the mission?

<i>I need you to escort the spooks.
They'll be searching for intel.</i>

Evac Fadawi and I need
it done in eight hours.

Eight hours.

Move to the midship. Move out.

Guys, we got a lot of dead
bodies here. Some recent kills.

I've been waiting for
this moment my entire life.

<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

The scientific discovery
of the century.

Equipment check.

<i>Up and running.</i>

Jackson. Swanson.

Let's move out.

<i>[low beeping]</i>

<i>Whoa, whoa, hello? I'm
getting some hits here.</i>

<i>Stand back, Grubamn.
I'll clear the entrance.</i>

Clear.

God!

<i>Traci, what you got?</i>

Traci!

Ugh.

Nothing.

Nothing.

<i>[chain clanks]</i>

Captain Willets, no sign of
any survivors. Also no anchor.

<i>[radio interference]</i>

HQ, this is
Deadwater. Over.

<i>[radio interference]</i>

HQ, you're coming in
unreadable. Over.

<i>[radio interference]</i>

<i>Talk to me, Buford.</i>

Yeah. Looks like somebody twisted
and ripped this off at T3, T4.

No weapon.

What do you mean
no weapon?

I mean whoever
did this,

did it with
their bare hands.

Holly shit! How the hell did that
guy just get impaled like that?

How in the fuck am I supposed
to know that, Swanson?

We're drifting due north, and straight
into Iranian territorial waters.

How much time
have we got?

Two hours tops.

Is Fadawi the only
enemy, Captain?

There's no fuckin' way
one guy did all this shit.

Don't underestimate
this prick.

Our mission is to contact
the enemy, look for survivors,

and keep this ship from
falling into Iranian hands.

Swanson, get down
to that engine room.

See if you can
get it started.

Ricks and I will
look for survivors.

Roger that. I'll see if I
can get the satellite up.

What is this place?

<i>The infirmary?</i>

<i>Not even close.</i>

<i>Maybe back in World
War I I but not now.</i>

<i>Jesus. [inaudible]
Traci, what you got?</i>

Eight point nine
and climbing.

<i>Could it be all the
souls leaving the bodies?</i>

Turn that stupid thing
off. Have some respect.

I'm doing my job.

Hey. I said
turn it off.

It's a swastika.

Hey, back off!

Don't shoot. Don't
shoot. I'm the engineer.

I go by Slab.

What the hell
happened here, Slab?

<i>I...</i>

I-I don't
really know.

Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

We've got a
live one here.

He's breathing.

It's Colin Willets.

<i>[over radio]
Captain, Alberts here.</i>

Willets.

<i>Captain, good news for you,
Sir, about your son. He's alive.</i>

On my way.

Careful.

This guy's heavy.

Get the feet in first?

All right, put him.

Got it.

God job, boys.

Is he in one
piece, Ricks?

<i>Yeah, he's doing all
right. His vitals are good.</i>

He's got a serious bump on the back
of his head. Probably has a concussion.

Wake him up. Give him a shot of
adrenaline if you have to but wake him up.

Captain, are you sure?

He can take it.
You two, with me.

Get out
of the way.


It's okay, it's okay. You were
having a nightmare. It's okay.

I'm Traci Leonard. I'm with the
special ops team that found you.

<i>(Ricks) Everything
all right in here?</i>

Yeah.

This is Ricks.
He's our medic.

See our patient's up.

Why don't you lay
back down? C'mon.

We'll check you up.

What happened?

You got your ass
kicked pretty good.

Are there survivors?

<i>Just a few. Not many but a few.</i>

<i>(Willets)
Give us a minute here.</i>

Holy shit.

How you doing, Colin?

You look a little
worse for the wear.

<i>It's been a
million years.</i>

Listen, Colin, I'm all
dressed up and no one to kill.

<i>We boarded this thing
and haven't fired a shot.</i>

What happened?

<i>What did you see?
What's happened?</i>

Well, after
dinner, we, uh,

well, we heard screaming.

<i>These fucking animals
were torturing someone.</i>

Wait a second. They were
interrogating someone.

Fadawi's on this ship.
Ace of spades.

Then you know
more than I know.

<i>(over the radio)
Captain Willets.</i>

Willets.

<i>We found another survivor.
It's the cook.</i>

Go ahead. So, you
heard screaming?

What happened?

I went to investigate and the next
thing I know is hell breaks loose.

That's the last
thing I remember.

So you didn't
see Fadawi.

No.

Take it.

You're gonna
need this.

Colin.

To be content.

Yes, Sir.

It was nice seeing
you, too, Dad.

All right, listen up.
It's gonna be a long night.

<i>It's where heavy
sweat starts.</i>

Mohamed Fadawi is
unaccounted for.

<i>Maybe he abandoned
the ship.</i>

<i>No, there are no
lifeboats missing.</i>

If he took off, he drifted
into Iranian waters.

<i>They would torture his ass
a lot worse than we would.</i>

<i>Just how dangerous
is this guy?</i>

<i>Traci, I saw a
DVD once of him</i>

<i>cutting off an Iraqi ministry's
head with a pocket knife.</i>

Gimme a nail file and I'll
show him how it's really done.

It's not funny, dude.

<i>So, 'till we find him
dead or alive, wrap him up.</i>

He's a threat.

<i>All right.
Let's get to it.</i>

Hold on a second. Slab, you and
Swanson get that engine running.

Buford, Ricks, set up
a temporary morgue.

Grubman, run a short test. Any Seal that's
not on the hunt help with the morgue.

I'm gonna offer this country
a set of commandments.

Captain?

Colin, you and
Alberts team up.

<i>Chris McCloskey, Sir. I wanted to
thank everyone for saving my life.</i>

Thanks, guys. If it weren't
for you, we'd probably be dead.

I'm the ship's chef, so I was gonna make
something real special for you, guys.

I got steaks and other
goodies whenever you're ready.

<i>We chow out
at 2200 hours.</i>

<i>And remember, at dawn
first light we are leaving.</i>

Okay, let's move out!

Let's go.

Traci.

Hey.

How're you feeling?

Better, thanks.

What about you?

I'm okay.

Just wanted
to apologize.

It's all right.

So, what are
you guys doing?

I'm...

<i>Sorry, Colin,
it's classified.</i>

Sorry.

Why don't you
ask your daddy?

[door slams]

Colin.

Where're you going?

You have a lot
of cleaning up to do.

You know, Colin, I know that
you're the Captain's kid and all

but you're still shit
the rag man to me.

<i>(Swanson) This isn't looking good I</i>

It'll take a while
to get enough pressure

and the pumps to get this
thing up and running again.

How long?

<i>A couple of
hours at least.</i>

Then we gotta see if the
turbines can take the heat

when the cooling
system is dry.

What do you
think crooked it?

I don't know. That's
the fucking mystery.

I'll tell you
what, Jackson.

When I joined the Navy, I thought
I'd be taken off in aircraft carriers

doing barrel
roles in F-14.

One, two, three.

<i>We're stuck here piling up dead
comrades after a bloody massacre.</i>

How's your kid, Sir?

She's good.

She was just made captain
of her soccer team.

I miss watching
those games.

The Seals are pretty much
the only family I've ever had.

<i>[Colin retching]</i>

What's the matter, kid?

You never saw nobody wearing
their heart on their sleeve?

Hey, Buford, where
shall I leave these?

There's fine.

<i>So, welcome to the Great
Persian Gulf Massacre.</i>

What do you
make of all this?

Well, we have a wide
variety of methods.

From impalement,
disembowelment,

dismemberment,
decapitation, electrocution,

<i>suffocation, and over here the
ever popular blunt force trauma.</i>

And the implementation of an
interesting assortment of weapons,

but generally whatever
seems to be handy.

And then of course there's
that whole dark theme

but using whatever the victim
has in their hands at the time.

And with that in mind, if
I meet up with this guy,

I hope I'm carrying
a sofa cushion.

So you figure it's
one guy, a terrorist?

The evidence points to it
all being done by one man.

You're kidding, right?

I kid you not.

The thing is that
the force of the blows

and the nature
of the injuries,

it's almost
as if, uh,

No, it just
seems impossible.

Well, anyway, you might
wanna head out 'cause it, uh,

it gets a little
gruesome from here on.

[switches on saw]

<i>[metal screeching]</i>

Hello?

Is somebody there?

Oh, gee!
Gee.

Why are you so jumpy?

Are you fucking
with me?

Why would I be
fucking with you?

Where did you
come from?

Over there.

You weren't
down here?

No.

Well, there's
somebody down here.

<i>[metal clanks]</i>

What the fuck?

<i>[shooting]</i>

Slab, come here.

Captain Willets. Code green.
We got the son of a bitch.

Oh, hey, cool off. They'll
stand trial for what he's got.

This time we had him soaked
in my men's blood, Sir.

<i>We don't know that.
We don't know him.</i>

You should know better than
to mess with the US military.

Get up!

Hey, cool off!

[jumbled talking]

I'll rip your fucking
eyes out your skull!

Fadawi. You are wanted


for murder,
terrorism,

mass murder,
kidnapping.

You understand me?

And for waging war against
the Iraqi government

and the government of the
United States of America.

<i>[coughs]</i>

I think you
forget everything.

Oh, I forgot.

[screams in pain]

You and your band of fucking
delusional fucking people.

Went through the desert killing
men, women, and children.

That's what you do.
I didn't forget.

Your army
has claimed over

half a million innocent
lives of my people.

<i>[yells in pain]</i>

Frankly I don't
give a shit.

I don't give
a flying fuck!

You know what? What I
wanna know is what happened

on this ship.

And you're
gonna tell me.

<i>I killed 30 of your
men with my bare hands.</i>

They were weak.

They were all cowards.


Cowards?
My men cowards?


If you do not
let me go,

your men will suffer
the same thing.

What did my men do
to deserve that?

They tortured me.
They tortured me!

They refused.
Then I felt a great power.

It was like God
taking over my body,

and giving me the strength
to strike down the savages

like they were
blades of grass.

What did this
god look like?

I never saw the face
of God myself,

but I felt
his presence.

Then I received
his gift.

To destroy and
vanquish my enemies.

Praise to Allah.


I'm the only god
you'll ever know.

You're looking at him!


No, no, no!
I'm not Fadawi!

Who are you?

I'm Ali Khalil
Ali Khalil.

What happened
to Fadawi?

He's not here.
I don't know.

Give me a knife.

No. They said they'd kill my
family if I didn't cooperate.

They said they'd kill my
dad, my mom, everybody.

Okay. They sa...
They said I looked like Fadawi.

I'm a computer programmer.
I host websites.

You're a decoy.

You may not be guilty
of all this shit.

But you're still the enemy
as far as I'm concerned.

Hey, look here.
It's supper time.

<i>Why don't I go see if there's
a pork chop leftover for you?</i>

Yeah?

<i>[door closes]</i>

This is it.
It's now or never.

<i>[engine starts]</i>

<i>[laughs]
Habba-habba.</i>

<i>(Swanson) You got this engine purring
like a freaking Ferrari. No joke.</i>

Ferrari? Lieutenant,
that's Italian.

What you're hearing here
is a United States warship.

Nice.

Are you hungry?

Yeah, I'm
always hungry.

Let's go see what
McCloskey has got to cook.

Sounds good.

Watch this.

Now we got power.

You know your way home?

<i>Yes, Sir.</i>


Times like these

in the midst of
drama and tragedy,

the only thing that can remind
us of the preciousness of life

is a little comfort food.

Tiramisu.

Food

of the gods!

Hello?

It doesn't
make sense.

What?

He has to be
our guy.

Do you think
he's a terrorist?

No. I could see it
in his eyes.

General Combs, he bullshit
me right down the line.

This is not
a rescue mission.

Something else
is going on here.

Grubman.

Yeah, you're talking.

I don't trust that prick.
Keep an eye on them.

Okay.

Okay, okay.
You wanna play games?

<i>[pans clank]</i>

Come out

wherever you are.

Colin?

Colin, is that you?

Okay, just to let
you know I don't...

I don't like
tight spaces.

So if you don't mind giving
me a little fucking room here.

Where is McCloskey?
McCloskey!

McCloskey!

Get here!

[all shout]

McCloskey!

<i>(Colin)
Captain I</i>

Hang in here.

<i>[roar]</i>

<i>(Alberts) Okay.
Everybody just remain calm.</i>

<i>Captain Willets, it's
Swanson. The engine is down.</i>

C'mon.
Walk and talk.

C'mon, let's go.

I gotta get
back to the room.

Sit and relax.

Swanson. Swanson!

<i>[alarm goes off]</i>

Colin, let's go.

<i>[alarm sounding]</i>

What the fuck?
Somebody killed McCloskey.

<i>That's it. I'm
getting my equipment.</i>

Nobody moves 'till we find out
what happened in the engine room.

Shoot me in the back.

Come away.

Come back here.
That's an order.

Captain Willets.

Fuck.

Go after her.

Fuck off, Buford.

<i>(Ali) What's going on? I'm
scared. What's going on?</i>

<i>Don't leave me! No, no, no,
no, no. Wait, wait, don't go.</i>

It's safe here.

<i>(man)
Fadawi, he's still in this room.</i>

<i>[metal cracks]</i>

Cease fire.
Cease fire!

Lieutenant!
What the fuck are you shooting at?

Thought I saw
something.

Nobody unloads his weapon in my
engine room without just cause.

Focus!
Get this engine started.

Forget it, Captain.
We're done here.

<i>What he's talking about
is we're fucked.</i>

We got no tools,
no spare parts.

<i>Pull a rabbit
out of your ass.</i>

How, Captain?

By the ears
if you have to.

<i>Focus, unless you wanna eat
tabouli in Tehran tonight.</i>


Jesus.

It's okay.
It's okay.

It's not okay.
What are you doing?

My job.

What is that?

It's an EMF
detection meter.

I'm looking for
electromagnetic fluctuations

that might indicate the
presence of an ectoplasmic force.

A ghost?

Bravo!

That's a pretty good guess for
a guy who keeps getting demoted.

<i>[door opens]</i>

What the fuck's
going on?

You tell me.

No, you tell me!

What happened?

I just left Grubman
and Leonard on top deck.

Yeah. Well, they're
looking for ghosts.

What are you
talking about?

They came with you.
Now, what is going on?

Your guess is
as good as mine.

My guess?

Yeah.

Now, what is it?
Is it ghosts or is it terrorists?

I'll look into it.

<i>(Traci)
Grubman, can I ask you a question?</i>

You already know that
I'm straight and single.

You've been doing this
for what, 20 years?

Fifteen, please.

And in that time,
have you ever seen a ghost?

Well, yeah.

You were with me
on the Hathaway case.

It's not the same.

This phenomenon kills.

<i>Okay. Traci, you need
to focus, all right?</i>

<i>You need to look at
the scientific lane.</i>

It doesn't matter if it
smashed plates or dead bodies.

What matters is what
the data says.

That's why we
came prepared.

Ricks, come in.

Ricks.

Give it a try.

Ricks, Alberts here.
Do you copy? Over.

Do you copy?

<i>[hollow shout]</i>

Jackson, are
you down here?



What happened?

He fell on me.

Are you okay?

He's dead.

Come on. Let's
get you cleaned up.



Be careful.

Oh, man. I don't
believe this.

First McCloskey, and then Jackson.
And now Ricks?

<i>Is everybody losing their
fucking minds or what?</i>

You know, I don't know whether
there's a ghost or a spirit,

but no human that I know of
can do this kind of damage.

It's a fucking ghost.

<i>It's not a goddamn ghost.
That's impossible.</i>

It's a fucking ghost!
It's screwing with our minds.

You control
yourself, soldier.

Suck it up.
We're gonna sink this ship.

We need to call for
evac right now, Sir.

Not 'till we finish
our mission.

<i>What exactly is
our mission, Captain?</i>

To confront and
destroy the enemy.

<i>You got it?</i>

C4.

Got it.

Buford, finish
your process.

Get these bodies
into a lifeboat.

No man gets
left behind.

Copy that.

Okay. Hey.
Hey. Hey.

I need you.
Okay?

<i>Swanson, okay?</i>

<i>[crack]</i>

Oh!
Hey.

Look at that
lifeboat food. 1945.

Holy Christ.

It used to wash ashore.

Ships getting blown
up off the coast.

Shall we?

Oh.

[both cough]

Good.

War's been
pulling me apart.


Lost countless friends.

My wife.

My son.

Your mother had
raven black hair.

You weren't born
in a hospital.

You were born
at home.

Your first crib was
a dresser drawer.

Had you all wrapped up in an army
blanket. You looked like a peanut.

Holy shit.

Who is he?

Get Grubman.

Why are my men dying?
Because of your scientific shit.

Why?

Your men are dying
because of an accident

that happened 60
fucking years ago.


I'm good cop.
He's bad cop.

You see this?

Look at it!

I sailed on this ship.

Did a boarding party.

1965. Vietnam.
Look at it!

I survived because I
got knocked overboard.

But I remember
this face.

<i>Would you tell me
about that face?</i>

Come, damn it!

Breathe.
Breathe, breathe.


[groans and coughs]

Breathe.

Now we're talking.

Give!

March, 1945,
all right?

Navy surgeon
Richard Nolton

was given a top
secret mission.

<i>To sail this very ship to Chile
and pick up a Nazi SS officer.</i>

<i>His name was Gunther Neumann.
They brought him aboard.</i>

They sequestered him in a black-ops
chamber and they interrogated him.

<i>The US had to find out how far
advanced they were technologically.</i>

<i>They were making scary shit at the
time. They had V2s, the rocket missiles.</i>

We thought they were beating
us at the Manhattan Project.

And this SS officer, they
thought he had the secret weapon.

Gunther Neumann was
the secret weapon.

What the fuck are
you talking about?

He was the first
participant

in a secret
Nazi experiment.

Eugenic conduction.

<i>He was their attempt to
create the perfect soldier.</i>

Highly trained. Chemically
altered. Genetically mutated.

Brainwashed.
Perfection.

Ultimate killing machine
with no conscience.

<i>And for science
it was beautiful.</i>

<i>And Nolton, he wanted
to unravel that science.</i>

<i>He was on a cutting
edge of electroshock</i>

<i>and neurological procedures at that
time, and he knew the power of Neumann</i>

<i>was embedded in
his nervous system.</i>

<i>So, he did these
experiments as you might say.</i>

<i>Torture. He did tests on his brain
chemistry and his genetic makeup.</i>

<i>And this strange electromagnetic
fields on the cerebral cortex.</i>

Just mind blowing
shit, you know.

<i>And it was during one
of these sessions</i>

<i>that an unexpected
electrochemical reaction occurred.</i>

<i>No one knew exactly what
happened, but afterwards</i>

<i>everyone on board
had been slaughtered.</i>

<i>Internal reports said
Neumann had jumped the ship</i>

and drowned while
trying to flee.

Doctor Nolton, he didn't buy it.
He was too fucking smart for them.

<i>He knew, he new
that Neumann's being,</i>

his, uh... energy

fused with this ship.

<i>The son of a bitch
was right.</i>

He was right!

Jesus.

<i>Listen. My orders are
to capture the entity</i>

and that's it.

<i>They come from General Combs, okay?
That supersedes your authority.</i>

Fuck him.

I'm gonna send this
ship to the bottom.

D... do you
not understand?

If we were able to capture
this, the-this entity,

if we were able to tap into
Neumann's power, harness it,

we'd have the most powerful
weapon on the planet!

<i>It could permeate any defense
system, any security perimeter.</i>

I n American hands
that'd be devastating.

Wrong. With that kind
of power in our hands,

we could win the war on terror. And
any good soldier would know that.

Over my dead body.

<i>(Grubman)
Listen to me.</i>

<i>It's the only way that
you can stop Neumann I</i>

You had your shot.

No. No, no. Listen to me.
He's too powerful.

You go after him now, and it's
suicide. Utter suicide, all right?

Colin!

Colin! Colin, stop it
and listen to me!

Colin!

Fuck!

God!

Come to papa.

<i>[creaking]</i>

Oh, shit.

<i>[saw functioning]</i>

Let's say we're looking for a ghost.
How are we supposed to kill this thing?

A ghost is a
concentration of energy.

Usually an ectoplasmic entity
unified by an electromagnetic field.

So, if you want to destroy it, first
you have to penetrate the field.

<i>And then disintegrate
the scepter.</i>

<i>(Slab) Is that a way of saying
that bullets can't destroy it?</i>

Maybe.

But even ghosts can avoid the
laws of physics and nature.


<i>[beeping increases]</i>

God, you are real.

You gonna sink
my ship?

You got a better idea?
I'm all ears.

No. Shit!

Are you all right?

Nah.

What's up?

You really
wanna know?

Yeah.

Sure are shrinking, you prick.

Fuck you. You grew
up, little prick.


Captain!

Grubman.

Swanson.

Swanson.

Holy shit!

Let him go!
Let him go, Grubman.

Argh!


Oh, shit.

Captain!

Come on, someone!




I hate ya.

I hate you, too.

Come get me!

Come!

So, we went by
the stair again.

By the first exit.

Main deck, second deck,
first platform.

This doesn't
make sense.

What is it?

There's an empty space where
there's no exit, no entrance,

no staircase,
no doorway.

Beneath the
interrogation room.

I think we have
ground zero.

We need your help.

Help with what?

Wait, wait, wait.
Help with what?

Slab.


Get up.

How do you feel?

I never felt better.

Great.

Where's that bastard
ghost hunter?

Fuck!

I'll get you up.

<i>What is that?</i>

It's a reversal
electromagnetic field generator.

That shit's only supposed
to be theoretical.

It's Grubman's prototype.

What does it do?

<i>I've never used it,
but theoretically</i>

it's supposed to capture and
store the paranormal entity.

We wanna kill
this thing.

Yeah, I know.

<i>Here's what
I'm thinking.</i>

If we can harness
enough power

and focus it into one
intense EM pulse,

we might be able to disrupt
Neumann's electromagnetic field.

<i>(Slab) How do you
know all this shit?</i>

MIT grad computer science
and engineering.

Can you get the
engine room powered up?

Yeah.

<i>(Slab) Through the
transfer switches</i>

we can deliver 480
volts 3-phase AC.

<i>[chuckles]</i>

Fry the fucker's internal
mother board, huh?

Send him straight
back to hell.

Let's find out.

Make sure that doesn't pull on the
transformer otherwise we're fucked.

<i>(Ali)
I won't.</i>

Okay.

Are you ready?

Ready.

Okay.
Whatcha got?

<i>Nothing.</i>

<i>Fuck!
Ready?</i>

Come on.

Now.

We got power.

<i>Yeah I</i>

Slab?

<i>We got it.
Power's up.</i>

Let's find this
fucking ghost.

<i>[hinges squeak]</i>

Sh. Sh.

Slab.

<i>[German marches]</i>

<i>[Hitler speaking]</i>

<i>[German national anthem]</i>

At last.

I have been
expecting you, Colin.

<i>You have not come
to destroy me.</i>

You have come
to join me.

<i>(Colin) Somebody killed McCloskey.</i>

<i>(Slab) Shoot the fucker,
Colin. Shoot the fucker!</i>

<i>[groaning]</i>

My god, take
anyone's body.

[Ali shouting]
No, no, no, no.

Enough, enough,
enough. Enough.

Kid, get up.

<i>[mixed voices]</i>

Where did he go?

<i>[shouting]</i>

<i>(Neumann) I n order to
stop this cycle of violence,</i>

<i>everyone must die.</i>

<i>[shouting]</i>

<i>[shouts]</i>

Colin!

<i>The [inaudible] flag
will call victory.</i>

<i>Together we can
change that, Colin.</i>


Colin!

Why?

<i>You could've
resisted him.</i>

You can still
resist him.


I'm right here!


Colin.

<i>We can change
our destiny.</i>

<i>You are not one of
them. You never were.</i>

I had a gift, Colin.

It was a very
special gift

which could've been
used to better mankind.

<i>But that is not
what happened.</i>

<i>I have seen warriors
like you come and go.</i>

<i>I have seen the wars.
They come and go.</i>

<i>First, my own people
exploited it.</i>

<i>Then the Americans.</i>

<i>The took me.
They captured me.</i>

<i>And they tortured me.</i>

<i>It is always the same.</i>

<i>This evil that
infects this vessel</i>

<i>must be destroyed.</i>

<i>We both know the history
of warfare, Colin.</i>

<i>We both know what these
people are capable of.</i>

Colin. Listen.

<i>Kill her.
Kill her now and save yourself.</i>

You can still
resist him.

<i>(Millets)
Confront and destroy the enemy.</i>

Captain!

You will need this.
To be content.

No!

I understand you've been
through quite an ordeal.

I suppose this is the part where you tell
me I signed a confidentiality agreement

before taking
this mission.

You're also required to
participate in the debriefing

which could take
several days.

You knew about Gunther
Neumann, didn't you?

You knew men's lives
were at stake.

The savage
bloodthirsty terrorist

has caused a
major provocation.

That's not
good enough.

That's all we need to justify our
next incursion in the Mid East.
