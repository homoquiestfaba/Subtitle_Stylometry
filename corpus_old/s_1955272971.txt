Do I look gross?

No, I just don't need
to see you half-naked.

Mom, you need to get dressed.

I can't.

You can't what?

Go. I can't go.

This trip was your idea,
though.

I don't know what else to say.

I'm sorry, Clark. I'm sorry
I'm always failing you.

It's okay.

I... I'm sorry.

I don't know,
what are we gonna tell Dad?

Tell him to come upstairs?

Okay.

Clark.
Thank you for your sensitivity.

-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah.

-Mom needs you.
-What?

She doesn't wanna go.

Wait here.

You're not ready?

It's too much for me
right now.

Shit, May.

I'm sorry, Roger,
I can't do it.

-This weekend was your idea.
-No teaming up.

Look, he was looking forward
to this!

Well, then, you go together!

W-without you?
What, just the two of us?

Dad, can you take me
to Etta's?

Couldn't you see her
when we get back?

-Just leave Mom here?
-Shoot. Gosh.

I just realized we have dinner
with the Friedlanders tomorrow.

And Shira's gonna be there.

I knew we had something.
Yeah, I'm not going to that.

I'd rather not go either, May.
Come on, I'll take you.

Wait. Can I...

Can I drive Clark?

I really... I'd really like
to spend some time with you.

So... tell me, is Etta's family
anything like ours?

In what way?

You know, close, open,
full of love.

Well, her parents
are getting a divorce, so...

Well... I do think
you'll find it easier

to date someone
with a strong family foundation.

-We're just friends.
-I knew that. I just...

It was just a... an unrelated
thought that I was having.

But you should experiment.

I had a lot of boyfriends
before Dad.

Mom, keep your focus
on the road.

My planner's in my purse.

Okay, just focus on the road.

No, if you're not going
to the restaurant,

then I have to let them know.
Okay.

I just...

I just...

Can I have the planner, please?
I need the planner now.

-Yeah, yeah, sorry.
-Okay, where's my page?

Boy, I am just, you know,
I am busy.

Mom, you need to take a left
up here.

Busy, busy.

Where is it, dammit?

There it is.

Clark! Baby! Sweetie?

Are you okay?

Can you respond to me, Clark?
Please, can you say something?

Answer me, please! Are you okay?
Are you okay, Clark?

Are you okay, baby?

Clark!

Clarky, where are you going?

Come on back!

Clarky? Where are you going?

Please. Clark?
Who are you calling?!

No. No, no, no, please.

Please, Clark.

Let's just keep this
between you and me.

I'm just so tired.
I just need to go home and rest.

I'd like to report
a car accident, in the Presidio.

Please?
Please, please, please.

Please hang up.

<i>Still there?</i>

I'd like to report
an accident.

Please. Come on.
I'll be good.

Central and Washington.

I'll just lie down. Please.
Come on, please.

Clark? Clark?!

<b>QUITTERS
Subrip: Pix</b>

Hello, Mr. Rayman.

I have your paperwork.

If you could just initial here.

Here.

Here

and... here.

Roger,
benzodiazepine withdrawal

can feature
a range of symptoms.

Insomnia, irritability,

depersonalization,

derealization... psychosis.

I think you missed one.

In order to alleviate
the severity of those symptoms,

we need to perform
a gradual withdrawal

tailored to the individual
patient.

Chemically, this involves...

delivering a dose of diazepam

equivalent to the quantity

of benzodiazepines
May was taking,

and then reducing it by 10%
every two to three weeks.

What is derealization?

Feeling like the world
isn't real.

The acute withdrawal phase
generally lasts

about two months.

She needs to be here
for the entirety of that.

But... symptoms can persist
for a year or more

and we recommend
she make regular visits

during that period.

Our goal is not just to take May
off of her medication, but...

to find a more appropriate way
to treat the disorder

that made her seek help
in the first place.

Roger... it can very painful
for a parent to admit to herself

that being away
from her loved ones

is what's best for everyone.

But you can help with that,

by reminding her
how brave she is,

how proud of her you are.

And that during
this difficult time,

she can have absolute confidence
in you as a husband

and as a father.

Hey.

Look at this view.

Not bad.

Are you leaving?

They're gonna take really
good care of you, I promise.

So you're going home?

I got a hotel nearby,
in case you need anything.

-So Pinky's with Clark, okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

C'mere. Come on.
Is he okay?

Yes, yeah, he's fine.
Come on now. Come on now.

Hey.

Come on now. It's okay.

It's okay.

Okay?

Yeah. Alright.

I love you.
Me, too.

How did you know
when the revolution was over?

When they couldn't fire
on their own people.

That's amazing.

Is there a more traditional
name for this dish?

Pork adobo, with rice.

Okay, great. Guess
I can take it from here.

-I just make myself a bowl?
-No, no, no, I'll bring it up.

Okay.

Should I get the door?
No, I got it.

Hey. What's up?
Hey. Nothin'.

Okay, just come on in.
I'm finishing up in the kitchen.

-Alright.
-Have a seat here?

I never heard your house
so quiet.

-Yeah, it's kind of nice?
-Yeah. Are you doing alright?

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

I'm sorry to cancel on you
the other day.

Things in my world
got a bit hectic.

No, no, no, that's okay.

So how are things
at your house?

Well, my sister caught
my dad jerking off

last night.

With porn?

No, she said
he was just hunched over.

God, I wonder
what he was thinking about.

Hope at the age
I still have a good sex life.

Alright, I'm gonna run this up
to Pinky.

-Okay. Tell her I said hey?
-Yeah, yeah. And then wait.

Alright.

D'you mind keeping it down
on the TV?

<i>Yeah, hello?
Hey, bud.</i>

Just wanna let you know
everything's okay.

Okay, cool. Etta's here.

<i>I don't wanna keep you,
but if you could just...</i>

for now, you know,
if we could just,

respect Mom's
or our family's privacy.

<i>What you tell Etta,
Etta might tell her parents,</i>

and her parents might tell...
God knows who.

<i>Not because they're malicious,
but people get curious and...</i>

So if you could just say,
Mom's travelling for work.

-What would I say she does?
-Don't be... Let's just...

let's just get through this
quietly.

<i>Okay?
Okay.</i>

Okay. Knock 'em dead, bud.

Thanks.

Jesus, you're so tight.

That feels good.

It's nice to be finally settled.
Yeah.

How'd I do?

It's great.

So can you take me
through it play-by-play?

The divorce talk.

Well, my sister picked me up
from volleyball

and then we went home

and sat in the living room
with my parents.

That's where your dad's
been sleeping?

Yeah, and whacking off.

Right.

And then they said...

Take your time. It's fine.

They said...

"Guys... obviously things..."

Wait, your mom said this?

Yeah.
My dad couldn't really speak.

So your mom said,
"Obviously things..."

Yeah.

"Obviously things...
aren't really... working."

Nothing more
needed to be said.

I dunno, sounds like a lot
more needed to be said.

Do you have any idea
who's gonna come out on top?

No.

Do you have any alcohol?

Maybe we shouldn't
if you're upset.

No, it's... it's fine.
I'm fine.

Okay.

You wanna watch a movie
after dinner?

I'd love to, but I can't.

I've gotta go
to Liam's party later.

His parties
are always more fun drunk.

-You're going out?
-Yeah. Sorry.

Thanks.
Welcome.

-Clark.
-What?

We can't
just casually hook up.

I don't want it to be casual.

I know that and...

I'm not ready
for something more intense.

Well, I-I just think
we have to learn

how to embrace intensity now,

or we run the risk of ending up
just like your parents.

I'm sorry.
Clark!

I'll get you a Band-Aid.

Fuck.

You guys see Etta?

You seen Etta anywhere?

Chug, chug, chug, chug!

-Hey.
-Hey, dude.

-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

-What happened?
-Nothing.

You know, I... I...

I'd really like to try
and be there for one another.

You need to go away.

-Okay, can we just...
-Dude.

Alright, I'm gonna go get
a drink. Are you good?

-Great.
-You probably shouldn't.

Hey, hey, you and I play
volleyball together, right?

-Yeah.
-Cool, cool.

Is her depression
slowing her down?

You think she's depressed?

-Yeah, I do.
-She's always laughing.

That's true. But, you know,
like... bigger the smile,

the deeper the frown.

She told me to keep an eye
on her. It's like she's...

putting me
in an awkward position.

I think she's gonna be fine.

-Alright, I'm gonna go home.
-Did you take a cab?

No, I drove. Why?

Think you can give me
a ride home?

Left.!

-That party was pretty lame.
-I was having a good time.

I'm supposed to call
my boyfriend.

It's morning where he is.
Who, who's your boyfriend?

His name's LassÃ«.
He lives in Germany.

He lives in...
So he's German.

-Danish.
-What's he doing in Germany?

He's studying
to be an architect.

He should've stayed
in Denmark.

Did you meet him
on the Internet?

No, actually, at a lecture
my stepdad gave in Berlin.

So you just asked him
questions in the Q&A?

He made a comment.

Was he like, "This is actually
more of a comment?"

Yeah... just like that.

Yes, exactly like that.

-Thanks for the ride.
-No problem.

<i>"Dear Etta,</i>

<i>"I'm disappointed in myself
for falling for you.</i>

<i>"I'm disappointed in the part of
myself that is attracted to you.</i>

<i>"Most of all,
I'm disappointed in you.</i>

<i>"You have so much potential,
Etta,</i>

<i>"but you have a deep fear
of intimacy</i>

<i>"and an unwillingness</i>

<i>"to confront the emotional
complexities of your life.</i>

<i>"I can no longer be there
to shoulder the burden for you.</i>

<i>"I can no longer waste my time
trying to help someone</i>

<i>who refuses help."</i>

Hey. I'm gonna go drop Dad off
at his hotel. You should come.

I have to write an essay.

We should make it clear
that we're not taking sides.

I really have to work.

I think your teacher
will understand.

Etta, don't be a selfish bitch.

<i>"For that reason, I recommend
we put an end to our friendship.</i>

<i>Sincerely, Clark."</i>

As you filter out...

I'm gonna play a song
that always reminds me

of Raskolnikov
sitting in his cell.

Alright, please be sure
to grab your essays

on Benjamin's The Storyteller
on your way out.

-Mr. Becker?
-Yeah.

I'm really sorry, I didn't get
to finish my essay. I've got

some stuff going on at home.
No problem.

Have it in by Friday.

Okay, thanks.

Mr. Becker?

Mr. Becker?
Yeah.

You... you have a minute?

What's up?

I was just wondering,
out of curiosity,

what I could've done
differently to get an A.

I only gave two As. A minuses.

Okay, so you're not...
grading on a curve.

No.

Do you have a rubric?

C is satisfactory, B is good,
A is exceptional.

And a B+ is?

Better than good,
but not exceptional.

So what makes an essay
exceptional?

If it makes me
feel something.

And mine...
mine didn't do that.

Correct.

So I feel like, if you
explained your grading criteria

to the class, it, you know,
might help us improve.

You mean it might help
you get an A.

Obviously, that's the goal.

For some. You know,
for others, the goal is to have

an encounter
with a work of literature.

And those students who surrender
themselves to that experience

are the one who are awarded
the As.

You mean A minuses.

Right.

Tsk.

Here, Clark. Ahem.

Thank you.

So the place where Mom is
is full of addicts, right?

No, it's nothing like...
Your mother's not an addict.

Ahem. She has a dependency.

What's the difference?

Well, actually,
it's pretty interesting.

They explained to me that...

Mom was taking
what she was prescribed,

but Dr. Willner was
over-prescribing.

So...

if anyone's really to blame,
it's Dr. Willner.

Technically...

we could sue.

Maybe it'd be useful if...

to talk to somebody
about all this.

What, instead of us...
just talking now?

No. I don't want it
to sound like...

this conversation has to stop.

This... this should...
this should keep going.

But maybe somebody who's...

who's less involved,
who's more objective,

would be a good... outlet...

in addition.

I-I didn't mean to...
to end this conversation.

No, I know. It's just kind of
hard to watch you eat.

Mom's, withdrawal is...

gonna be bad, right?

I'm gonna go visit her
in a couple of weeks.

You know, when it gets...
it'll get really brutal.

That'll be nice.

-Nice job, Coach.
-Hey, thanks. He was great.

I'll see you at practice, Clark.

Can we stop at the grocery
store on the way home?

What for?

Groceries.
To give Pinky the night off.

Hello?

<i>Hi, Roger.
How's it going?</i>

Good. I'm at the market.
Going home to cook for Clark.

<i>I've been trying
to reach him.</i>

<i>How is he doing?</i>

Gonna try my hand at,
miso... halibut mushrooms.

<i>Sounds good.</i>

Yeah, I'm excited to see you.

<i>Well, I just think it might be
best if we...</i>

<i>if we just kept it really
quiet around here</i>

<i>for the moment.</i>

<i>If you hold off visiting.
Can you understand?</i>

What... I just... I mean,
I had some, meetings...

<i>-Okay.
-scheduled in the area.</i>

<i>-I'm sorry,
-No, no, no. I get it.</i>

Hey, Rog!

Shit. Bradley Friedlander
spotted me, so I gotta go. Bye.

How the hell are ya?

You know, we never got dinner
back on the books.

I know. I-I...
Hey, Shira.

It worked out. I mean, Shira's
been having some problems.

-What... what's going on?
-It'll be fine.

Well, it's these college
acceptance letters.

They keep coming in, and
these kids can be so cruel.

Just when Shira needs
her friends to help her

pick a school,
they get resentful. And why?

-Why?
-Why?

I...

Because, well,
she got accepted to all of them.

That sounds hard.

I'm just worried
about balancing

hard work and happiness.

Hey, hey, hey, I just got a
Chris-Craft. Old wooden thing.

-Gosh. What... what year?
-'74. New engine, old cut.

You know, my grandpa had a,
a '50-something.

It was... Wisconsin.
No shit.

Yeah, we'd get up early every
morning, before everybody else.

I was his favourite. And...
and we'd motor into town,

say hi to his old buddies,
Irv and Al...

Yeah, the lines on this thing
are just boom. I'm telling you,

mwah! I got it here
at Richardson Bay.

Gosh, man, I'd love
to get out on the water.

You know what water gives you,
right?

Perspective.

-Right.
-Yeah.

If your boat's got the pull,
I got the skis.

Why don't you talk to Clark,

then the four of us
can do a double date?

That sounds...
that sounds great.

I mean, I...
I'll run that by him.

He would just...
he would love that.

What can I get for you?

No, I'm... I...
I'm... I'm good.

Okay, well, it's...
Good luck with the...

The fish looked funky.
Let's get Mexican.

-Hey, what's Body Garden?
-What?

It says Body Garden. You were
there the day before yesterday?

-It's a spa.
-What do you go for?

I think I had a...
a manicure.

Mom wants you to call her.

No, from the car.

Yeah, hi.
Do you have manicures?

No. Okay. Just massages. I see.
How much are those?

Got it. Thank you.

What... what happened to
that masseuse you and Mom liked?

Dina talks too much.

So, what, you just wanna be
touched in silence?

She's overpriced.

You know, they... they said,...

a 30-minute costs $30.
Bradley's on his...

And an hour long costs $50.

And you paid 100.
Two hours.

Isn't it degrading?

-I feel better after.
-For the women, I mean.

Bradley and Shira are
on their way out.

Let's not do this here.

-You can go.
-What about dinner?

-Yeah, go ahead and eat.
-I... I cleared my night!

Hey... is there any chance
you guys would give me a ride

to Clement St.?

-Sure, Clark, yeah.
-Let me help you guys.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Thanks, Clark.

-Clark?
-Hey.

-What's... going on?
-Just browsing.

You ready, Nat?

Mom, this is Clark.
He's the boy

who drove me home
the other night.

Hello. Veronica.
Nice to meet you.

Likewise, yeah.
Are you guys cooking?

Do you wanna join us?

No, I didn't mean
to invite myself.

I just invited you.

Well, thanks. I just haven't
showered since cross-country.

We have running water, but,
of course, no pressure.

Was that a pun?

-Never mind. Sorry.
-It-it's okay.

So, I mean,
if it's not an imposition...

-I think he's saying yes.
-Yes. Yes, I'm saying yes.

-Here you go.
-Thanks.

Natalia's always singing
Mr. Becker's praises.

-Do you like him, Clark?
-He's clearly smart, but,

I don't know, he seems
to get off on feeling

like he's tricked us into
believing that he's brilliant,

even though
he actually might be.

I don't know if that makes
any sense.

I think he actually is.

At his age, I wanted people
to think I had talent.

Whether we had it or not
was a secondary concern.

-But you were talented, Todd.
-How did you two meet?

-He found me under a tank.
-What?

First, when we met,
it was 1986...

Come on.

She thought it prudent
to lay down in the middle

of a street right in front
of one of Marcos's tanks.

-I thought it would stop.
-Did it?

-No. God, no!
-So it just...

Rolling and rolling
and rolling.

-So what'd you do?
-I got up and ran.

-My God.
-Made for one hell

of a photograph. I was there
taking pictures for Time

and I tried to sell my editor
on putting this great photo

on the cover.

Young British girl
engaging in a failed act

of civil disobedience.

It's incredible.

Here it is. He says
his editor didn't go for it.

I couldn't tell if it was a...

good photo or
if I just loved the girl in it.

Well, we stayed in touch.

She met Patrick
and they had Natalia.

And later, after Patrick passed,

rest his soul...

you know, well, after
an appropriate interval...

it comes time
to take what's yours.

So... so you were both in the
Philippines for People Power.

Exactly.

A friend of mine, Pinky
Lapeira - she's a family friend,

friend of the family...
told me about it.

What happened...

No, please let me help you.

We got it.
You go and join Natty.

No, you go on.

Okay. Thanks for dinner,
you guys.

Hey.

What a dinner.

-You have fun?
-Yeah, I did.

-Here.
-Thank you.

-You alright there, champ?
-Yeah.

I was wondering
where your boyfriend is.

Another beautiful day
in Germany.

I should probably leave before
I build the courage to kiss you.

It's giving you a lot of
confidence, isn't it?

Sto...

<i>-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Hi.</i>

<i>-If a suite becomes available?
-We will let you know.</i>

<i>And, in the meantime,
if there's anything else...</i>

-Clark?!
-Yeah?!

-How was your night?
-Good, good.

I'm gonna visit Mom...

in a couple of weeks.
Nice!

It'd be easy to get...

get an adjoining room
if you wanna see her.

Sorry. I gotta go do homework.

-Can I help?
-No, no, no, I'm okay.

Get it, get it, get it!

-Hey.
-Good game.

Thanks. I'm, happy you're
seeing Natalia. She's awesome.

Thank you. Thanks.

Does that mean
we can be friends again?

-No, I don't think so.
-Why not?

can we just not talk
about this now?

-I miss you.
-Hey.

Hi! You killed it, girl.

Thanks. Am I interrupting
something or...?

No.

I told Todd and your mom
that we're gonna feed Gus

when they go out to dinner
with the Owens, so...

Okay.

Okay, have a good night, guys.

You, too.

-Hey, look who's here.
-Hey.

Look at you, girl.
You did so great.

Great game, Natty.

-I don't wanna finish.
-Why?

-I'm just nervous.
-You're doing great.

It's just, you know,
seeing Etta after your game,

I kinda got... hard.
Not in a good way, though.

Like... I was really
uncomfortable.

But... you know,

I really like you,
I just don't...

want you to finish something
she started.

Won't it hurt
if you don't come?

No, it'll be fine.

Looks sort of... puffy.

Yeah, yeah, I think
if we just stop looking at it,

it'll go away.

Were you and your dad close?

Yeah, but he didn't really
like to hug or touch.

Even with your mom?

He could be warm with her.

She and Todd seem
pretty affectionate.

I was actually surprised
they've only been together

for a few years.

She was seeing Todd
before that.

-When your dad was sick?
-Yeah.

Did your dad know?

I told him.

Did he have long enough
to fix things with your mom

or find somebody else?

He was pretty sick
at that point.

Guess it was the right thing
to do.

I think I told because...

I was mad at my mom,

'cause she wouldn't let me go
to Tahoe with my cousins

or something.
Did it work?

I went to Tahoe, but...

I probably should've been
hanging out with my dad

instead of getting drunk

and making out
with all my cousins' friends!

Kind of hard to imagine
you having a promiscuous phase.

I think that's giving
my 13-year-old self

a little too much credit.

Okay.

When do I get
to see your house?

-There's nothing there.
-What about your parents?

-They're not really around.
-Where are they?

My dad is visiting my mom
at rehab.

What's she there for?

You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

She just has, like, problems.

I'm sorry.

You got lucky with the way
things turned out here

at the Abernathy residence.
Williams.

I didn't take Todd's name.

When I get outta here,

I'll make it up to them
and I'm bringing my girls

on the most amazing trip
of a lifetime.

'Cause you don't get that
a whole lot with your girls.

Once they're grown up,
they're outta there.

It's, you know,
it's the way it goes.

-Hi.
-Roger.

Hi. Sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

No, no, no, no, it's...
it's fine.

Well... my God... Roger...

Wh-wh-why don't you guys
finish up here

and I'll wait for you in your
room? Okay? Go ahead.

Hi.
Hi, Roger. What's going on?

-I had a meeting nearby.
-So you just came to...?

-To see you.
-You can't just show up.

Well, you know,
I wanted to see what

we're spending our money on.

I... I...I thought we could
have a night together.

I booked a room
at a bed-and-breakfast.

R-R-Roger, I'm...

I'm in the middle of rehab.

You can take a night off.

Who's with Clark?

<i>-I could call Pinky.
-You could call Pinky?</i>

I could call Pinky.

You're not the only one
who needs a vacation.

This is not a vacation!

When I'm out of here,
you can do whatever you want,

but right now, I need you
to be a father to our son.

What the fuck do you think
I've been doing?

Roger...

Why can't we just have... fun
together?

'Cause it doesn't sound
like fun right now.

-Okay.
-I need more time here.

I'm getting better.
I-I'm feeling better.

But when you show up
out of the blue and...

and I see what kind of state
you're in

and how this is affecting you,

I feel terrible for leaving
Clark alone with you.

Okay. Okay.

I'd like to cancel the room
I booked for tonight.

<i>We do have a 24-hour
cancellation fee.</i>

<i>-Okay. How much?
-$462.</i>

What, to... to cancel?

<i>We'll have to charge you
for a night.</i>

<i>-Okay.
-We have a card on file.</i>

<i>-That's fine.
-I can go ahead and run that.</i>

<i>-It's a little steep, but...
-I'm sorry, sir.</i>

No, fine.

<i>We have a VISA that ends
in 8446.</i>

<i>I'll go ahead and charge $462...
Okay.</i>

<i>I'm gonna go ahead
and run that now.</i>

Okay, thanks.

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

-So you all set?
-Yeah, I'm good.

-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

Clark?

Clark?

Good morning, Mr. Rayman.

Hi, Pinky.

-Should I go wake Mr. Clark?
-He's not there.

He must've slept out.
They do grow up so fast.

My son is applying
to high school.

He's been asking
about Seneca.

Goddammit.

I understand Seneca
is sort of political.

It can be sometimes.

Despite his good grades
and strong sense of humor,

his application
might be ignored.

I think their admissions
process actually is

pretty thorough.

If you'd be willing to say
something to the administration,

it would go a very long way.

-Clark?
-Yeah?

Can you come in here, please?

-Can I make you breakfast?
-No, I'm okay.

Can you show Francis
around Seneca?

-Who?
-My son.

-Pinky's son.
-Yeah, sure.

She's afraid,
without a proper introduction,

his application might fall
through the cracks.

-Yeah, of course.
-Thank you.

Hey, c-can I make you
breakfast, Clark?

I wanna... I wanna tell you
about my visit with Mom.

She blames me
for you not having called her.

-What would I say?
-Tell her you miss her,

that you're excited for her
to come home,

that you can't wait
for us to be a family again.

That would be selfish.

-Why?
-If she's getting better there,

I don't know
why she'd come back here.

Well, she can't stay there
forever.

Yeah, but maybe she'd be
happier somewhere else.

We talked about buying
that loft by the ballpark.

No, no, I mean like a divorce.

What I'm trying to say, Clark,

is that I'm judged not only as
a husband, but also as a father,

and I can only be as good
of a father as you are a son.

Well, if I'm honest, I don't
think I can be a very good son

right now.

I never wanted to be the kind
of dad to make a lot of rules,

but when I see start
to lose your way,

I have a responsibility
to get you back on track.

What makes you think
I'm off-track?

Where were you last night?

At my girlfriend's.

What, they just let you
sleep over?

Yeah, when I told them
about you and Mom,

I think they kinda felt bad.

You're a mean-spirited
little shit, you know that?

I know you feel that way.

Yeah...

Think I found two people
who don't.

I got a feeling that
when they figure you out,

they're not gonna want you
around anymore.

Mr. Becker?

-Hi, Etta.
-Hi.

-Do you know why you're here?
-Not really.

The essay you handed in
you didn't write.

What do you mean?

You plagiarized it
from the Internet.

Did you think I didn't know
about the Internet?

I thought maybe
you just wouldn't care.

What does that mean?

Y... you know, you're...
like a cool young guy.

So I wouldn't care
if you cheated?

I thought that since the
whole theme of your class

is that nothing external
can inflict as much pain

on a person as a person
inflicts on themself,

it... it might be
enough that I feel bad.

If I don't report this,
I could lose my job.

My parents are getting
divorced.

So did mine.

And I took it as an opportunity
to get lost in literature.

-Where would you read?
-At the library.

Right, but by the time
volleyball's over,

the library's closed.
Then go to a cafe.

I don't know
of any good ones.

That's not my problem, Etta.

Look, I'm having
a really hard time.

Just... please give me
another chance.

You didn't hand this in.

Thank you.

Kelly's Cafe
in Selma is open 24 hours.

Okay.

So I'm there writing
most nights.

Alright, thank you.

try and finalize the deal.

We're having some people
over on the 4th,

so I hope you can make it.

Okay, love. Bye.

Here you go.

If I'm in your way,
let me know.

You're fine here for now.

So, guys, in order for me
to feel comfortable

with this arrangement,
I'm going to need you

to stay down here and you
to stay up there after, say,

10 p.m.
Totally understand. Yeah.

Natty?

Me, too.

Thanks, Veronica.

<i>At approximately 7:15 a.m.
on Tuesday, September 14, 1999,</i>

<i>Barnabas Q. entered Control Room
B of the Oceanside Waste Water</i>

<i>Treatment Plant and sat at his
desk and turned on his computer.</i>

<i>It was his three-thousandth day
at the job</i>

<i>and today was supposed to be
the day that he quit.</i>

<i>Nothing theatrical,
no fireworks.</i>

<i>He would spare his colleagues
his honest feelings</i>

<i>about the quality
of their work and character,</i>

<i>and so spare himself
their honest feelings</i>

<i>about the quality of his work
and his character.</i>

<i>"It is just time for me,
in my own life,</i>

he was going to say.</i>

<i>But by 7:24 a.m., Barnabas Q.
Had not only failed to quit,</i>

<i>he had accepted an assignment
his boss emailed,</i>

<i>which Q thought would only
take him the morning,</i>

<i>but ended up taking him
the rest of his life.</i>

Hi.

-Hey.
-Mind if I sit here?

how about one of these?

Okay.

-Thank you.
-No problem.

-She know you're living here?
-I don't know.

When did you talk to her last?

Not since she left.

Maybe you should take it?

<i>-Hello.
-Hey! How are you?</i>

-Natty?
-Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Bedtime.

<i>-Are you there?
-Yep.</i>

<i>-What's been going on?
-Nothing, just school.</i>

<i>How are things with Etta?</i>

Good. They're good.

Yeah?

So... lots of interesting people
here.

<i>I think that you would find
their stories fascinating.</i>

<i>Very different experiences,</i>

different from the people
that I find at home.

<i>Clark?
Yeah.</i>

Where are you?

I'm at home.

I miss you.

<i>So much.</i>

Okay, bye.

-Okay, I've got one.
-Yeah.

I'll take this.

-Do you want me to?
-No, no, I got it.

Come on, Gus. Come on, Gus.

Todd, would you
bring me a glass of water

on your way back up, please?
Yeah.

<i>scattered
quickly, each to his own house,</i>

<i>while the suitors strolled back
to King Odysseus' palace.</i>

<i>Telemachus, walking the beach
now, far from others,</i>

<i>washed his hands
in the foaming surf</i>

<i>"Dear god, hear me!"</i>

-Clark?
-Yeah.

-Do you know where Gus is?
-I have him.

You have to let somebody know
if you're going to take him.

I thought... I thought
he could use a walk.

I, also wanted to get
some stuff for the house.

When's your flight?
Midnight.

What's the book about?
If you don't mind me asking.

Malaysia, mostly.

Natalia told me that your last
book was about Burma.

Friday should be fun.
You know, the party?

Shit, I have to get wine.

No, no, I can... I can pick up
something for you

while you're away.
In what world, darling?

I'll just go now.
Can I come with you?

Natalia will be home
any second.

No, it's fine. I should
probably give her some space

after practice anyways.

Clark, honey?

Can I pitch in?

No, when somebody's paying
for something,

it's rude to stand so close.

Well, don't be ashamed.

I think it's nice that
you splurge on your guests.

-Have a good night.
-You, too.

Have you read this yet?

No, but your parents'
books are much better

than the ones Mr. Becker's
been assigning.

-Babe?
-Yeah?

Better get going if you're
gonna make your flight.

Okay.

Todd talked to your dad today.

Todd wouldn't have invited him
to the party, would he?

-I don't know.
-I really hope not.

That would be embarrassing
for him

in front of
your parents' friends.

Bye, guys. Be right back.

If the dancing girls come,

tell them I said go ahead
and start a bath.

-Hey, Todd?
-Yeah.

You wouldn't have happened
to invite my dad

to your cocktail party,
would you?

It didn't occur to me.

Okay, just checking.

I did tell him Natalia had
a tournament this weekend,

so he should be expecting you.
You didn't tell me that.

-Bye, Natty.
-Bye, Mom.

-I love you.
-Love you.

-Bye, Clark.
-Safe travels.

Come on. Okay, guys.
Let's go, let's go.

-Behave, you two.
-Be back in a few, guys!

So... I've been thinking more
about sex.

Would you mind if I stayed
here while you're away?

Could you ask your mom
if that's okay?

Maybe when she gets back.

It'll be hectic
with the party.

I could call her tomorrow,

but she doesn't usually
respond well to me being pushy.

so do you think
you're ready?

Yeah, I think so.

Are you?

Yeah. It'll feel good to be
that close to each other.

-Yeah.
-I will get a condom.

-Will that fit?
-Why wouldn't it?

-Clark?
-Yeah?

Were you planning
on coming back up?

I promised your mom
we weren't gonna share a bed.

Todd wouldn't say anything.

I'm just kind of towing
a very delicate line here.

I'm just trying
to understand...

Natalia, I love you, okay?

I just don't wanna fuck anything
up.

Hey, Todd?
I've been meaning to ask.

I'd love to buy
one of your prints.

-I'd be happy to give you one.
-Really? Thank you.

-Hey, did you call your dad?
-No.

Is it too late?

Yeah.

You know, I was thinking
on the ride home

it might be nice
to invite him to the party.

Or dinner?
Or to something?

Yeah, I was thinking
about the same thing,

but I sort of came
to the opposite conclusion.

You know, I don't have
all the facts, but,

from my conversation with him,
it seems like

he wants to be
a part of your life.

Yeah, but he's really never
found a healthy way

to be a part of anybody's life.

Alright, buddy.

I'm gonna enjoy
a little quiet time now.

Come on.

I can take
the next eight in line.

Next.

I'm... I'm actually
still waiting on my guest.

I can only give one ticket
to each person in line.

any chance
you'd be willing to part

with your ticket?

I've been looking forward
to this all year. Sorry.

It was worth a shot.

Thank you.

Thank you.

-Am I too late?
-It's sold out.

Sorry,
I got held up at the hotel.

My sister got rejected
from Sarah Lawrence

and is freaking out because
she thinks it's the only place

she can be comfortably lesbian.

So are we going to Kelly's?

I'm trying to get some
distance from the manuscript.

okay. Well, I think
I might just head there anyway.

Maybe you could give me a ride?

Are you a big fan of Eggers?

Yeah, he's not my favourite.

-Veronica.
-Thank you.

Veronica? Hon?

-Hey.
-Hey.

-You look nice.
-Thanks.

Gonna get outta your way
so you can go talk to your mom.

-Mom?
-Yeah.

How do you feel about Clark
staying the weekend?

-With you away?
-Yeah.

We've been very generous,
but I can't in good conscience

explain to Clark's father
that his son is staying with us

while you're out of town.

Do we actually owe his dad
an explanation?

As to the whereabouts of
his child? Yes, Natalia, we do.

Mo... Tell him he's happy
here.

-Is he?
-I think so.

Are you?

Yeah.

Perhaps you should think
on that before picking a fight

you may not want to win.
I'm not picking a fight.

It feels awfully soon

for you to be living
with your boyfriend.

How long after Dad died were
you and Todd living together?

-Excuse me?
-Five weeks?

It was not five weeks.

Eight? Twelve?

Within three months,
he was living here.

All I'm asking is for you
to be a decent host

to my boyfriend for two nights.

Russia has been around
for millennia.

We know who we are.

Middle East's
as old as it gets

and there's no more
unstable place in the world.

I'm gonna have to agree
with Todd on this one.

Age doesn't bring wisdom, just
stretch marks and cellulite.

How old are you, Daria?

Let me get you a drink, Daria.

What brings you
to the States?

I am visiting artist friend.

Cool. What medium
does he work in?

Flesh.

What?

She explores the stigma
surrounding plastic surgery

and prostheses.

My mom always wanted
a new nose.

Have you had any work done?

'Cause... 'cause you look...
really great.

Veronica, the boy wants
to know if my tits are fake.

He's a very verbal boy.
Come in for a drink.

<i>Hey, it's Clark.
Leave a message.</i>

-I hate that building.
-I knew it.

-Did you get enough to eat?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

and the whole building
will turn green.

I guess it'll look like shit
until then.

-Exactly.
-What are they talking about?

You wanna go upstairs?

It'd be kind of rude
to just sneak off.

I don't think
anyone really cares.

She's become
quite a pretentious snob.

Clark?

Clark.
Did you invite him?

-What are you doing here?
-It's time to come home.

You weren't even invited.

Yes, I was.

Yeah? By who?

Pack your stuff.

-I think you should go.
-Pack your shit, Clark.

-Please keep your voice down.
-I'll give you two minutes

to say your goodbyes

and let these people know
it's time to come home!

-Don't embarrass yourself.
-You're coming home.

Tomorrow I'm taking you
to visit your mother!

Don't you fucking shush me!

You're pathetic.
You look pathetic.

You're coming home
with your father

right this fucking minute!

That place is not my home
and you're not my father.

You don't even know
how to live.

You don't know shit
about shit!

And I hope to God
someday you are cursed

with a little
cunt son like yourself!

-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

-Clark...
-What?

I'm sorry.

No, don't be.
Really, it's cool.

-Sh-should we call your mom?
-About what?

I mean...

When does she come home?

I-I don't know. What sane
person would go home to that?

Well, where else could she go?

She'll find something.

Maybe you should just...

I'm not really looking
for advice, okay?

Only trying to help.

I... I know you are.
It's just, being here's enough.

What are you gonna do
about this weekend?

well, I thought
it was okay with your mom

if I stayed here.

That's what I'll do. I mean...

Nat?..Todd didn't invite
him, did he?

I think he did.

Why would he do that?

I don't think he or my mom
really want you here.

What can't he do to your mom
when I'm around?

I just think there's...

Like, I'm pretty
low-maintenance.

Maybe you shouldn't be here.

I'll sleep on the couch
tonight,

and we can talk
about this in the morning.

-I'm leaving in the morning.
-When you get back.

I don't... wanna come home
to you.

Why?

It just doesn't...
doesn't sound very nice and...

I don't think you're very nice.

-Hello?
-Hey.

<i>What's going on?</i>

I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

How are you?

<i>-I'm okay.
-Where are you?</i>

<i>At a cafe.</i>

Could I, come and see you?

I'm on my way out.

No, no, just let me come
and see you first.

<i>Actually, what's the address?
My phone's about to die.</i>

Kelly's Cafe.

<i>Between 6th and Brannan.
Okay, cool. Thanks.</i>

Hey!

-Declined.
-Just try again.

Hey, I'm so sorry. Can you spot
me 20 bucks for the taxi?

I think my card was cancelled.

Great. Can you look at my stuff?
Thanks.

Sorry.

Am I holding you up?
Sort of.

You have to be up early
tomorrow, right,

for your tournament?

I was crashing at Natalia's...

but it was... it was time.

Where're you headed?

Mr. Becker said
I could spend the night.

He lives nearby.

So why are you here?

'Cause I wasn't sure
if it was a good idea.

-But?
-But then I got pretty tired.

Wh-why don't you just go home?

My parents sold their house.

I've been sharing a hotel room
with my sister.

But she's pretty
much taken it over.

-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

Is there... is there
something you wanted

to talk to me about?
Just wanted to see you.

-Well?
-That's it.

Any chance I could come
with you?

That's a lot of books.

Yeah, it's,
it's for a story I'm writing.

What are you writing
about?

How... how would you
describe it?

It's a love story?

about late capitalism.

Don't you wish you had the
patience to read all of those?

Yeah, well, the stuff worth
reading is usually a slog.

Yeah, but what you assign
is pretty fun.

Those are the hits.

I figure if I can hook you guys
early

that maybe you'll dig
for the deep cuts later.

So just you here?

It's just me.

Did you decorate it yourself?

yeah.

It's good. You did a good job.
What do you think?

-Yeah, I like it.
-Reminds me of you.

It's... feels like,
you know, all your stuff.

Could I get you
a glass of water?

Sure, yeah.
Actually, you know...

I could do with a drink,
if that's okay with you.

-sure, yeah.
-Awesome.

Do you want any?
No. No, thank you.

-Etta?
-I'm okay.

So have you been here
for a while?

-A few years.
-Where's the bathroom, Jake?

It's just...
it's right around...

Okay.

Ahem-hem.

She needed a place to stay.

No, it's nice
that you offered.

If you're not careful
with this information,

I could be fired.

Yeah, no, of course.

I'm gonna...

Okay. I'm gonna get
some work done,

but you guys can hang out
in here. That's cool.

Okay.

Hey, Jake?

Can I crash on your couch?

I guess so.
Thank you.

And... and I guess
I'll sleep in your bed.

Yeah, okay.

You sure you don't want
a drink?

No, I don't wanna be tired
at my tournament tomorrow.

Right. Well, thanks for making
this happen, anyways.

-Good night, Clark.
-Good night.

I'm sorry...

<i>-Hello?
-Hi.</i>

<i>Clark!</i>

Are you okay?
Yeah.

I've been trying to reach you.
Where are you, sweetie?

I'm at Mr. Becker's apartment
with Etta.

<i>Mr. Becker, your teacher?
Tell me what's going on.</i>

I... I don't really know
what's going on.

they're in bed together,
so...

Should you call her parents?

Well, should you...
should you knock?

<i>-She likes it.
-Honey, no.</i>

You... you go there
and you knock

and you see if she's okay.

<i>Clark?</i>

Clark?

Yeah, no, I-I'm still here.

<i>I'm happy to be hearing
your voice.</i>

Does your dad know you're there?

Shit.

<i>Clark?</i>

-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

Okay.

She's sleeping.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

I think I'm gonna head out.
Do you wanna come?

No.

He's home.

So your call last night
scared me.

Yeah, sorry.

No, I-I'm glad you called.

But you scared me.

Yeah, you, kinda sounded
like you were out of breath,

like I just woke you up
from a bad dream.

Well...

it was a long night
for everybody.

Yeah. Where in the process
are you?

-Near the end.
-Yeah?

It's kind of scary to think
about coming home?

I'm...

I'm gonna wait in the car.

Well, it seems like you...
you like it here. It's helping.

I've missed you.

You want me to time you
around the block?

I'm okay.

Come on,
what was your best time?

A little over four minutes
when I was, like, 13.

Well, you think
you can beat that?

-I dunno. Probably.
-Give it a shot.

On your mark... get set... go!
