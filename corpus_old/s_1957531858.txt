(MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY)

Hey, Lexi.
It's me, Mikey.

Mikey.

No, no, no, no. Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

I got a big fucking
surprise for you.

WOMAN: Who is it?
I was cleaning...

Hey! Surprise!

Hey. Hey, Lil.

Oh, my shit.

you, too, uh...

How you been?
How you been?

Okay...

It's me, Mikey. Remember me?
I know.

I know.
What are you doing here for?

Well, I just
came to see Lexi,

and, well, I came
to see you of course.

Both of you guys.
But is Lexi here right now?

LIL: Lexi!

Thank you.
LEXI: What?

LIL: You won't believe
who's here.

Oh, my gosh.

Oh, my shit.

Surprise!

Oh, my God, what the...
What are you doing here?

Aw! It's good
to see you, too.

Why are you here?

Fuck. Oh, God damn it.
Where do I begin. Uh, look...

No, you're not coming
in this house.

All beat up.
That's right.

What... What the fuck?
All right...

All right, well,
I'll tell you what's...

Yeah,
why are you here?

LIL: Yeah.
MIKEY: Uh, well...

LIL: Why are you here?

Mom, Mom,
can you give me a minute?

Lil, I just wanted
to come in,

and hang
for a couple of days.

No, you're not
coming in here.

LIL: You're not coming
in my house.

Mom, can you
just go inside and...

The fuck, Mikey?
I... I know.

I know.
This is unexpected.

Oh, nothing with you
is unexpected.

You still got that sass!

(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

Look, I don't know
what you want,

but I can't help you.

So it doesn't matter how
or why you're here.

Go away.

MIKEY: Hey, Lil.
LEXI: Ma!

God damn it.
Look, I don't want

to be here, all right?
This is embarrassing.

LEXI: Well, I don't
want you here either.

You think I want to
show up like this?

I got my ass fuckin' kicked.
I just need a place to crash.

Why can't you be cool?
What does it look like?

A hotel?
Really? It's like that?

Can you get off
the property, please?

What, why... What are you
fucking going do? Really?

Well, you...
Oh, you want me to call the cops?

I'll call the cops.
Don't. Don't fucking...

No, I'm calling the cops.
Fuck!

Nine, eight...
God...

LEXI: Seven... Faster!

I'm technically
off the property,

so you can't
call the cops,

because I'm on public land
respecting your boundaries!

Can you keep it down?
Can you come over here

so I don't have to project my
voice, please?

Oh, fuck!

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Seriously, I just need a place
to crash for a couple of days.

What's the big deal?
Mikey, go fuck yourself.

Oh, you don't even know
what I've been through.

Oh, right.
Look at my fucking face!

I just was
on a bus for two days.

I had to walk here
from the bus station...

Why don't you stay
with your mama!

My mom's in a nursing home
in Le Marque.

A care home.
I can't sleep there.

Mikey,
what do you want?

My God, I just...
What do you want?

I just fucking told you.

I just need to crash
for a couple days.

What, you want money,
right? Here.

I don't want fucking money.
I got 22 fucking dollars.

Here, come get it.
I can't come on your property.

Come get your money.
You should've called!

If I would've called,
you would've said "no."

I'm still saying "no,"

so you fucked yourself
by coming.

Oh, please, come on.
You know me.

Damn straight, I do.

You know me
and you know

I wouldn't be
literally begging

if I had
somewhere to go.

And if you don't
let me in,

I'm going to sleep in
Tarpey fucking Park tonight,

is that what you want?

You said
you were never going

to step a foot
in Texas again.

And then the world fucked
me, what can I say.

Peek-a-boo!
Ma!

See, your mom's saying,
"Let him in.

"Let him in
and take a shower."

And the dog's like,

"Oh, he's a good man,
I can tell by his nice energy."

Please let me take
a fucking shower.

(SHOWER RUNNING)

(TAP RUNNING)

MIKEY: <i>The shit got
out of fucking control.</i>

<i>If I didn't see it
with my own eyes,</i>

<i>I wouldn't believe it.</i>

The place turned
into a fucking trap house

right under my nose.

Fucking Speigler sends me
some scraggly bitch from Ohio

that he promised
would be chill.

Her first night in the
house, she gets in a fight,

knocks this
fucking bitch out.

Crack. Right in front of me.
I was like, "Holy shit!"

So, anyway, she bounced.

Now, I got to fill the room
so I don't lose the month

and her friend comes
and stays there

and gets high
the whole fucking time.

Why didn't you just
kick the bitch out?

Well, I had seven hoes

and they're letting MS-13
deal drugs the whole time.

Lil, MS13 is a gang you
don't want to fuck with.

You're good? You're good?
Okay. You need any coffee?

All right. Sorry.
So, anyway.

Long story short.
I ended up hiding out in my room,

because these dudes were
straight fucking killers

and I didn't wanna
fucking get killed

so I played video games
the whole time.

Remember the house
in Chatsworth?

LEXI: Mm-hmm.
Well, this place was, like,

maybe five times bigger.
Beautiful house.

I had a two-year lease

with an option to buy it at
the end of the lease, right?

Well... (CHUCKLES) As usual,
shit got fucking crazy.

I snapped, I got up in
one of those cholos' faces

because I'm not
a little bitch.

I came this fucking close
to getting shot.

This fucking close.

So then I had to crash
with Kennedy.

You remember Kennedy?
Remember...

Do you remember Kennedy?

Anyway, I had to crash
at Kennedy's

for, like, three weeks
until he kicked my ass out

'cause someone left
his back door open

and his cute little cat
got out and got killed.

And it wasn't me,

it was some dumb cunt that
he fucked the night before.

I'm sorry,
I don't mean to swear.

But I don't do that,
everyone blames me, like,

"Oh, Mikey's the bad guy."

It's, like, whatever,
it's bullshit.

So, anyway,
I had to crash at his place.

He kicks me out,

for, like, three nights,
I slept on the fucking street,

I slept in a alleyway.

I used my shoes
as a goddamn pillow.

It's fucking bullshit,
my neck was so sore,

I got beat up,
that's how all this happened.

Two homeless fuckers
beat the shit out of me.

They took everything except
my phone and my wallet.

And the only reason
they didn't get that

is the cop showed up
and arrested my ass!

Why'd you get arrested?

I have a feelin' there's a
whole lot more to this story.

I'm sure there is.

MIKEY: It doesn't even matter.
Look, guys.

This could be fun,
this could be cool.

I got a plan.
While I was on the bus,

I thought about this,
I gave it some serious thought.

Lil, you know I'm not a
freeloader, right?

While I'm here...
How long?

MIKEY: "How long" what?

How long do you plan
on staying?

Well, I mean, that's up to
you, and Lexi of course,

but look, I saw some
hiring signs on the way in.

I'll go downtown tomorrow,

and I'll get a job
that pays cash.

I'll teach fucking karate
if I have to.

(LEXI MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY)
I just got my green belt.

I'll make cash and I'll
help out around here.

You need a man
around the house. Okay?

I already see
shit's falling apart,

I can help out
with all that shit, right?

I want at least $200 a week.

Thank you, Lil,
you're not going to regret this.

Seriously, thank you so much
for trusting me... I'll...

LEXI: Let's give it a couple
of days and see how it goes.

Yeah, whatever
you're comfortable with.

I don't want
to make you uncomfortable,

I'm here to help.
And look, before long,

it'll be
like we're still married.

We are still married.

Oh, my God,
the backyard's a mess.

See, you need a guy around...
Dude, there's a dragonfly.

WOMAN: (OVER TV) <i>...find
out, when she called you...</i>

<i>Now, you traveled?</i>

WOMAN 2: <i>Yeah.</i>
WOMAN 1: <i>How many days later?</i>

WOMAN 1: <i>Okay.</i>
(MIKEY GRUNTS)

WOMAN 2: <i>This was
about three days.</i>

WOMAN 1: <i>So,
she called you and said</i>

<i>they were
in a high speed chase...</i>

WOMAN 2: <i>She said
I was in a high speed chase,</i>

<i>with Dante...</i>
Mornin'.

Mornin'.
<i>She was chasing him.</i>

<i>He was in the car,
she pulled up,</i>

<i>somebody told her...</i>
I love this show.

I watch it everyday,
so get used to it.

(MIKEY GRUNTS)
<i>And from what I was told,</i>

<i>they were doing like 80.</i>

<i>Down a main street.</i>

<i>She's trying to catch him,
and he hit a pole.</i>

<i>A fence pole.</i>

WOMAN 1: <i>What do
you say happened?</i>

MAN 1: <i>I was coming back
from the airport,</i>

<i>driving her off as she stated.</i>

<i>And when I was
at the stop sign,</i>

<i>I had the right of way to...</i>
(GRUNTS) Excuse me.

<i>They ran the stop sign
and t-boned the car almost.</i>

WOMAN 1: <i>Was this your baby
mother in the other car?</i>

MAN 1: <i>No.</i>
WOMAN 1: <i>When she calls you</i>

<i>and she tells you,</i>

<i>'cause I believe
that conversation happened,</i>

<i>do you call him?</i>
WOMAN 2: <i>Yes.</i>

WOMAN 1: <i>And what does he say?</i>
WOMAN 2: <i>He like, "Man...</i>

<i>"You know that crazy broad.
It's not my fault.</i>

<i>"She crazy... I was tryna..."</i>

<i>He was in fear for his
safety is what he told me.</i>

WOMAN 1: <i>Is that
what you said?</i>

MAN 1: <i>No.</i>
WOMAN 1: <i>I don't believe you.</i>

<i>Sir, you have a $500
counterclaim</i>

<i>for emotional distress.</i>

<i>I cannot wait to hear this.</i>

Hey, Lil,
I'm going to borrow

some of your ground beef,
okay?

Okay.

(PEOPLE ARGUING INDISTINCTLY
OVER TV)

Hey, Lexi?

Hello?

LEXI: Yeah?
Hey.

Uh, I'm not looking
too presentable,

so I'm going to let this
thing go down

before I go
on these interviews.

So, few more days, okay?

All right?

LEXI: Sure.
Thank you.

MAN 1: (OVER TV)
<i>It was, before she started</i>

<i>getting into my business.</i>
WOMAN 1: <i>Really?</i>

<i>So, that's what your
counter claim is about?</i>

<i>She has caused
you emotional distress.</i>

MAN 1: <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
WOMAN 1: <i>Not baby mom...</i>

Put some clothes on
for Christ's sake.

MAN 1: <i>All of them do.</i>
WOMAN 1: <i>Okay.</i>

MAN 1: <i>They all run together.</i>

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

WOMAN 1: <i>Your counterclaim
is dismissed, sir.</i>

<i>Judgment in this case

LEXI: Beggars can't be
choosers, Mikey.

(PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
OVER TV)

Your last job listed

is over 17 years ago.

That's quite a gap
in employment.

MIKEY: Well, you know,
I've worked almost everyday

for the last 17 years.

It's just I've been
self-employed.

What line of work?
Oh, mostly entertainment.

I've been living
in Los Angeles,

that's why I have the 323
area code right there,

in case you were wondering.
But, yeah.

Film, television,
music, entrepreneurship.

Okay, so why are you
interested in working here?

Well, I'm living here now.
Okay.

We were estranged for a
while, I'll be honest.

But, you know,
we're both from here.

And, you know, now that
we're back living here,

we decided
to make a run of it.

Well, we do require
some experience

or some previous training
in the service industry.

MIKEY: Mm.
And at least one reference.

Uh, yeah.
That's going to be tricky.

MIKEY: But I did work for
CiCi's Pizza from '99 and 2000.

I think that branch
that I worked for closed.

I put it on there.

But, yeah, you could contact
corporate if you like.

Look, if you were
incarcerated, that's okay.

I just need something

from your parole officer.
(LAUGHS)

<i>All right, look,</i>

I'm going to be straight
with you, all right?

All right. Tell me.
I need that.

Okay. All right, look,
I'll just be honest with you, man.

You don't recognize me,
do you?

I'm an adult film actor.

Excuse me?

A porn star.
I'm a porn star.

I know, I've been working

in the adult entertainment
industry

since 2001 and, you know,
even though...

Did you say porn?

Hey, you know,
it was fun, I think.

I'm sure it was. (LAUGHS)
Yeah, all the ladies...

Why don't you
just google me?

Look up "Mikey Saber."

Mikey...
Saber.

S-A-B-E-R XXX. Go ahead.
Search it.

This is unbelievable.

MIKEY: Yeah,
that's what they say.

Yeah,
just pull down... Yep.

That's me right there,
younger me, but...

Oh, that certainly is you.
Mm. Yeah.

2,000 movies, six awards,

13 nominations
and Hall of Fame, did that.

I want to, you know,
start fresh,

and really start
a new chapter, a new life

with you,
and your company, ma'am.

I'd really
like to help you,

but, um, my management,
they would not permit this.

I'm sorry,
but you're just simply

overqualified for this job.

I'm just not sure
our customers

would be comfortable
with you waiting on them.

They may have seen
one of your movies.

Later on,
when you get home,

google "Mikey Saber XXX"

and you'll see
what I'm talking about.

It's some good shit.
MAN: Okay.

Yeah, yeah I'll do that.
Thanks, man.

Thanks, man. Take care now.
Okay.

MIKEY: <i>Stripes, Food King,

<i>I even went
to fucking Luby's...</i>

Nobody's hiring.

(TV PLAYING)

At least get your
assistance check.

MIKEY: <i>Well, I may be able
to get you pay stubs</i>

<i>from Brazzers

<i>It's a long story.</i>

WOMAN: <i>Okay,
but you need to be</i>

<i>a Texas resident

Oh, no,
I'm residing here.

I moved back in
with my wife last week.

WOMAN: In order
to be a resident,

you need to reside here
for at least 180 days.

So, why don't you
come back

when you can provide me
with a Texas State ID,

and a copy of your
marriage license, okay?

Yes, ma'am.

Also,
I'm a little confused,

is your last name
Davies or Saber?

It's so good to see you

Hey, I'm Mikey.
My daughter, June.

Uh...

Oh, shit, June.

I haven't seen you since...

Last time I saw you,
you were up to my knee.

You've grown up.

Big girl now.

So, why you back,
Mr. Hollywood?

MIKEY: Oh, uh...

Well, me and the ol' lady
trying to give it another go.

Oh, really?

So you're telling me Lil
is letting you stay there?

Well, yeah, yeah.
I mean, you know, I'm helping out,

and chipping in

Which is why I'm here.

if maybe I could move
some bud for you?

Speaking of
back in the day,

Oh, the accent?

Yeah, I had to lose it

But y'all know I'm still

Mm-hmm.
You helpin' Lil with the rent?

MIKEY: Of course!

But, uh...

I'm kinda cash poor
at the moment,

do you think you could
put me on Front Street?

Let's start
with an ounce.

MIKEY: Yeah, that'd be great.

Thank you.

Zena. Zena Valentine.

Zena. Melissa. Yeah.

Yeah, man, you were
in a bunch of her scenes.

Uh, she was in a bunch
of my scenes, technically.

But yeah,
that was my girl after Lexi.

Bitch goes and marries

some rich software dork
she met in Vegas.

I think they have a kid,

they live in Salt Lake
or something.

Boring fucking life.

LONNIE: Wow, man...
Yeah.

Who do you think
discovered her?

I got her signed
to Renegade,

I taught her the pole.

I dealt with her crazy

drugged-out ass
for a year, man.

As soon as the bitch's head
gets big, they betray you.

That's what happened
with Lexi, you know?

Really? Lexi?
Yep.

Jules Jordan bought her out
from under me for 10 grand

the first chance he got,
that fucker.

Wait, he bought her?

Yeah, he paid her
10 grand to betray me,

but the joke's
on Jules, though.

She went from doing roxies
to smokin' tar

the minute I wasn't there
to straighten her ass out.

We were together
for five years.

Five fuckin' years.

She won two AVNs
under my watch.

She leaves me,
bitch gets shot out in nine months,

couldn't book shit.

And then she goes,
and moves in with mommy

exactly one year after
she left me high and dry.

Shit.
Yeah, shit is right.

Hey, is Whispers
in Galveston still open?

(GLASS THUDS)

You're not leaving that
dirty glass in the sink.

No, sir.
Okay.

Clean it up.

Okay.

That's right,
we all do our share.

Mm-hmm. Okay.

Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

What about the others?

Those are yours, too.
Lil, look. All right.

The last three houses
I lived in had dishwashers,

I'm not doing the dishes.

I don't do that shit, right?
You do not live here.

This is my kitchen.

If you can't follow
the rules...

Out! Out! Out!
Why are you talking to me

like a little kid.
Hey, Lexi!

Don't you disrespect
your mother-in-law!

Your mom's starting shit
with me.

Can you please inform her
I'm not a dick?

Why would I lie
to my mother?

Oh, you, too, huh?
Really?

You're just gonna turn on me like
that, after...

I've been mowing
the fucking lawn.

Oh, my God.
What?

You've been
mowing the lawn.

What? Yeah, I've been
mowing the lawn.

Jesus Christ, Mikey.
LIL: You've been leaving

You haven't given me
a dime.

I know, but I'm going

I'm providing protection.
She's an outside dog!

She doesn't need walkin',
Mikey!

I'm providing security.
I've been helpin' out.

We don't need security.
Do we need a security guard, Mom?

Oh, come on.
I didn't know that we hired

a security guard.

Yeah, you...
You're safe now because I'm here.

LIL: You're always
on my couch.

You've been drinking
all my Ensures.

MICKEY: Listen, I'm trying
to get a job.

You've been here
for three weeks now!

I've been looking
for a job the whole time.

I want you out of here now.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Wait, wait.
Listen, listen.

I know I said I'd help out
with the rent.

LEXI: You did. You did.
No, wait a minute.

Let me finish.

I know I said
I'd help out with the rent.

Yeah.
So...

I'm not gonna
help out with the rent.

Well, get
the fuck out, then!

I'm gonna pay
the whole goddamn thing!

Now you're talkin'.
Uh-huh.

August is on Mikey,

MIKEY: Yes, the whole month.
Okay.

Um, I wanna have...
She wants a pink.

I want a pink...
Yeah, pink sparkle, please.

MIKEY: Give her the pink sparkles.
Whatever she wants.

LEXI: And then I can get...

Ooh, can I get a chocolate, too?
Can I get a chocolate?

Thank you.
Whatever they want. Okay?

LIL: Donut holes, please.

MIKEY: Yeah,

Yeah, this is the day

LIL: This is the day

Mr. Moneybags here.
Thank you.

(CHUCKLES) Okay.
LIL: All right.

MIKEY: Look at that, huh?
We got the holes, you're good.

Is that enough

You should get it while
we're here 'cause this is it.

All right. There you go.
That's...

Is that one yours?
Is that the cappuccino?

Okay, that's the cappuccino.
This one's...

That's the biggest one

I don't know what more you want me to do.
All right.

LEXI: Thank you.
Thank you so much.

You guys go ahead

I'll grab this.
How much is that?

This one, I don't know
what to do with.

I don't know what to do
with that one.

I don't know what to do
with that, Ma. Look.

All right, I'll have one.
Don't you feel like it? Okay.

Just tear me half.
Eat the part that doesn't

have the sprinkle on it.
I don't want the colored one,

just give me half of
one of the donut balls.

Half of a donut ball?
Why do they call it a hole?

I don't understand why
it's a hole if it's the...

The hole is in the middle.

That's where
it came out of.

Right. Okay,
that makes sense.

LEXI: This one doesn't have
enough sprinkles on it.

See that?
(LIL LAUGHS)

What do you guys, uh...

Can you guys wrap this up?
We got to get out of here.

LIL: Okay.
Excuse me...

What... No, Mom.
I am eating.

I am going to savor every
goddamn sparkle on this donut.

MIKEY: Keep it down.
LEXI: What? She don't care.

MIKEY: I know but it's rude,
we just came in...

I don't know
why he's walkin' so fast.

Just hurry up.
Must be a fire somewhere.

Come on,

Okay, come on.

Stop act...
You get so dramatic.

I'm not acting.

Fire? What do you mean?
We're going home.

They glazed

But you know what?

I don't say shit,
it's all good.

I'm a team player.

Almost every single girl
I did a scene with

started fucking me
off-camera, right?

But the agents hate that shit.

But what do they expect?
You know?

It's like, girl comes by
my model house,

they see my Hall of Fame
trophy on the mantelpiece.

They're like, "Oh, my God.
He's famous for fucking."

LONNIE: Wait,
you used to have your own model house?

I had three
model houses, bro.

And the last one...
Ooh, that was a savage-ass house.

Till I started letting agents
book bottom bitches in there.

Bottom bitches?

Yeah, bottom bitches

are technically
the best of the hookers,

but they're
still the hookers,

and that's what
they started sending me,

was the fucking hookers.

And that's when
everything went to shit.

'Cause see, once a porn chick
gets a hooker mentality,

they become
a fucking nightmare.

A real pain in my ass.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Dude, I forgot how hot
Gulf Coast bitches are.

I saw this girl over by the

She works there,
smokin' hot.

MIKEY: Uh, go left here. Go left.

(CLEARS THROAT)
We're getting close.

I really appreciate you
driving me home.

STRAWBERRY: Mm-hmm.

It's a nice area, huh?

STRAWBERRY:
Yeah, it's fancy.

I just wanted
to buy my mom

something nice
to retire in, you know?

STRAWBERRY:
That's real sweet of you.

Yeah.

All right.
Yeah, it's right up here.

Hey, we're getting... Yep.
Right up there. There it is.

Maybe we'll...
Can you turn it down?

'Cause we don't...
I don't want to wake up my mom.

Yeah. Whoa,
this is fancy.

Yeah, it's nice.

I'd invite you in,
but like I said,

you know,
my mom's feelin' sick

and she don't take
too kindly to strangers.

She's just not all there,
up there right now.

No. Yeah.

Probably not
a good idea, anyway.

Yeah.
So thanks for the ride.

Anytime.
I work on Wednesday.

Oh, well,
I'll see you Wednesday.

Okay.
Okay.

MIKEY: <i>Look, I'm just glad</i>

<i>weed is still illegal
in Texas.</i>

You guys have no idea
how hard it is

to move flower
in Cali right now.

I mean, yeah, you know,

selling it to the bitches
at my model house,

but besides that,
felons and illegals.

Hey, don't mess
with big oil.

TCPD kittens next
to those Valero guys.

That goes without saying,

but you know,
keeping it on the DL

has been the secret to my
success all these years.

How do you think
I stayed out of prison?

How do you think
I never got shot?

Mom,
where's the hot sauce?

Where the hell
it always been.

No hot sauce, Mom.
I don't see it.

LEONDRIA: Did you look
in your bedroom?

You were
eatin' pizza there...

Oh, my God, Mom.
...the other night.

I don't... I can't...
Where's the hot sauce?

Why would he take it
into his room?

LEONDRIA: You're laughin',
but you were eatin' pizza there.

Mom, I've checked everywhere
in the kitchen!

Where's the hot sauce?
Hey, man.

What are you lookin' at?
This ain't got nothin' to do

with you.
Fine.

The world would
collapse without me.

Did you check
under your bed?

Hey, yo. So, I heard
you do porn or something.

Five AVNs.

What? That's an STD?

It's the, uh...

It's the Adult Film Awards,

it's like the Academy Awards
for what I do.

Okay, man. That's what's up.
Yep.

Best Oral
three years in a row.

Best oral?
Yep!

Just one question.

Ain't that
about getting head?

Well, I mean...

Yeah, something like that.

So, then what they got
to do with you?

It's not like you're the one
doing any work or anything.

I'm not doing the work?
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

Sister,
let me tell you somethin'.

Hey, man,
don't call me sister.

Oh, my bad.
June, right, it's June?

All right, June, look,

if I won three years in a row,
with three different girls,

the chances of it being
the girl is pretty limited.

Think about it.

No, seriously, look.

I'm the one guiding
the girl in the scene.

Essentially
I'm face-fucking her.

Pardon my language.

So the female really has
nothing to do with it.

You know, I'm the one
that's holding her head

for like 15 or 20 minutes
while I'm force-fucking her,

so how is that about her,
exactly?

I got it, man.
No, seriously.

Look, it's about
the shit I say,

the way I hold her face
towards the camera

while she spits,
and drools all over herself,

and I pinch her nose
and make her gag.

It's all technique.
I said I got it.

(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

Thank you.
MAN: Thank you.

Thanks, D.

Man, this place
is off the chain.

Thank you so much
for hooking this up.

My pleasure.

So tell me more about LA.

Maybe you should find out
for yourself.

You think
I have the money to go?

(CHAIR SQUEAKS)

You got a truck,
you can go anytime you want.

That's my mama's truck.

She just let's me use it
'cause she works from home.

Well, when I left Texas City,
I didn't have a dime.

I just said to myself,

"Mikey, one day,
you're gonna own this town."

And I just went for it,
you know?

Mm.

What is he doing
behind the counter?

He's going to help me
with my SAT prep.

No free donuts.

Thank you.

So you were saying something
about just going for it.

Are you trying

I'm trying to get hired.

(EXHALES, CHUCKLES)

Yeah.

(DOORBELL DINGS)

Hiya! What can I

Hi, sweetie.
Can I get, uh, two...

Two chocolate covered
donuts and a medium coffee?

All right.

Good afternoon, sir.

You're crazy,

You could have just
waited until now, you know?

Where's the fun in that?

Hmm.

Come here.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

(MUFFLED TV CHATTER)

Yo, Lonnie!

Wait up!

What's up, man?

Man, some errands.
I got to go to the mall,

Mm.

Cool. Cool.
I'm rolling with you.

Uh, just warning you, man,

she lets me sell weed

to the hardhats at her work.

I mean, does it get
any better than this?

Uh... Oh, yeah.

Yeah, man, no, uh...
No problem.

Man, this place ain't changed
much in 15 years, Lonnie.

Yeah, I know,

Hey, um...

I think I'm going to be

Uh, that's the one I got

And, uh, that's for
my three tours in Iraq.

You're not even wearing

Well, yeah,
of course I am.

MAN: <i>What's
the Army Uniform Regulation?</i>

(MAN 2 LAUGHS)
The code.

Uh, to do my best,

to do my duty
and to serve my country.


MAN: You sure
it's not AR670-1?

LONNIE: Uh, well,
as you guys know,

there's a lot of different
codes in the military.

right here, folks.

This man is not a veteran.
He's a fake and a fraud.

LONNIE: Give me those back,
those are mine.

MAN 2: Take your jacket off.

Oh, you sure you didn't

Is he stalking you?

No. No, we hang and shit.

I've been trying

you're not going

Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro.
Hold on. Hold on.

You can't compete

Hey,

Who is this?

Come on.
I'm with him now.

Yeah, you heard it from her

Are you serious?

I never wanted

You're a little slut.

You're a fucking slut!

You know who Tori Black is?

Yeah, man, of course,
I know who Tori Black is.

All right. Well, uh,
she won Performer of the Year

two years, back to back, right?

I think that Strawberry's
got the potential.

I'm not exaggerating,

I really believe this.

I think... I think she could
win three years in a row.

I can never tell if you're

much attention we could get.

We weren't even naked,
we had,

propositioned us
to sell a nude pic.

And I did,
and he Venmo'd me 60 bucks.

Sixty bucks?
Mm-hmm.

You're a bad, bad girl.

But 60 bucks ain't shit.

You should get
at least double that.

So were you planning

I fell out of the tree,
remember?

I fell straight down on the

so I had a leg broken
and an arm broken.

And then Mom had to wheel me
around in the shoppin' cart

for, like, a month...

So good to see you again, Lele.

You, too, my baby.
Please come back.

I will. I will.
Don't be a stranger.

You take care of yourself,
baby girl.

You, too.
All right?

Be safe out there.

Mikey, I'm sure
I'll see you soon.

Yeah, you will.

LEXI: Thanks, Lele.
LEONDRIA: Good night.

LEXI: Good night.
LIL: God bless you.

(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)
MIKEY: Did it come through?

MAN: (ON PHONE):
<i>Yeah. Bullshit.</i>

You see her?
She's fuckin' smokin', right?

You're not gonna
believe this, dude.

Her name is Strawberry.
MAN: <i>What?</i>

Fucking Strawberry.

You can't make
this shit up, man.

<i>Strawberry?</i>
Yeah. No, I...

Has there even been
a Strawberry before?

in, man, I'm tellin' you.

This is like a Jenna Jameson,
Sasha Grey-level find here.

Aw, fuck, I'm blessed,
I'm so fucking blessed.

See, this is my talent,

I could be a badass scout.

I got my finger on the pulse
of the next generation, baby.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING
ON SPEAKER)

LONNIE: How do you know she's
gonna be down for this, man?

Oh, she's down,
trust me, she's down.

Plus, she sucks on my fingers
while I'm fucking her, bro.

Oh, yeah? That's cool.

Yeah, it's cool.
You know what that means?

She likes fingers?



Means she likes
having a dick in her mouth

while getting fucked.
It's a telltale sign, bro.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Any time a girl puts something
in her mouth while fucking,

either they're familiar
with that scenario

or they're intrigued
by that scenario.

Think about it, man,
it's just logic.

I never thought
about it that way.

Yeah, man,
no, that's what Lexi did.

You know,
when we first started dating,

Lexi would suck on my fingers
while I was fucking her.

That's what schooled me
to the knowledge

that she'd slept with

more than one dude
at a time before.

So when I proposed
a threesome, she was in.

She didn't fight it,
she fucking loved it.

Huh.
Yeah.

(MIKEY GRUNTING)

Well, what do you think

Lexi is gonna think
about all of this, though?

Dude, Lexi is the bane
of my fucking existence, man.

Everything that has gone wrong
in my life the last 15 years

pretty much
stems back to her.


I've forgiven her
over and over again.

I've overlooked so much shit
in the name of forgiveness,

but it doesn't matter,
she always fucks me...

Hey, how you doin', sir?

Go look up the Lexi Lane,
Ashley Blue gangbang.

At the end,
I'm fucking Ashley,

so I wasn't paying attention.

Lexi starts badmouthing me
to the male talent on camera.

Saying that I'm limp dick
and shit,

and that's
a total fucking lie.

Of course
I can get it up, right?

I didn't know this until
the fucking DVD came out.

I wanted to knock
that bitch out.

Anyway, don't say shit.
That stays between us.

I got you, brother.
You got the next set.


(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING
ON SPEAKER)

Appreciate you.
Thank you.

So... I joined
your Pornhub page.

You watching my scenes?

Checked out a few.

I watched the one
you won Best Oral for.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Not that it's not hot watchin'
you, but, like...

Yeah?

So the girl,
plus all the guys she's blowin'...

Hello, Mr. Mikey.

Hey, Ms. Phan.

Uh, I swept outside and
watered the plants for you.

Great.

So the girl, plus all the guys
she's blowin', win the award?

Right.

But we all share it,
the award.

Okay. But, like,

she's on her knees
blowing a line of guys,

it's like her scene.

Why are you winning
an award for it?

Okay, well,
that's up for discussion.

Anyway, you shouldn't
be watching that stuff.

You know,
just pretend it doesn't exist.

Don't watch that stuff,
it's not good.

I'm sorry.

Did I hurt your feelings?
No. It's okay.

Sorry, I should have asked

if it was okay
if I watched.

MIKEY: Hmm.
(DOOR OPENS)

MIKEY: Well,
if you do want to watch one,

check out <i>The Fast and
the Furious</i> parody I did.

STRAWBERRY: Are you serious?
MIKEY: Hell yeah.

<i>Fast and the Fury-ass.</i>

Yeah.
STRAWBERRY: I love it.

MIKEY: Clever, right?

I play Brian O'Conner,
that's Paul Walker's character.

Man, my acting was next level.
Seriously.

I mean, my scenes were miles
above the other scenes.

To this day, people
will tweet me and be like,

"Oh, you were
the perfect O'Conner."

I was actually even
nominated for that role.

Best Supporting Actor
in a Parody.

But I didn't win.
It was the big snub of the night.

There was boos and everything.
It was crazy.

And then Paul Walker goes
and gets himself killed,

which is such a bummer

because then I'm fucked
out of the sequels.

That sucks.
Yeah.

So...

You want to come over
this weekend?

Come over?
What, to your place?

Yeah. We can spend
Saturday night there.

Uh... Nah, nah,
I'm not into

the whole
meet-the-parents thing.

You think I'd introduce you
to my mom?

Are you fucking kidding me?
No. God, no! No.

She'll be out of town.
She got a new boyfriend,

and they're going to Houston
to fuck themselves silly.

So, we got the place
to our own,

to fuck ourselves
even sillier.

MIKEY: Ah!

(TV PLAYING)

Mikey?
Yeah?

You haven't even asked
about Eric once.

You got my Facebook
message when it happened.

We chatted.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)

My heart goes out to you.
It was a terrible thing.

So...

Any word on you getting
custody or whatever?

Yeah.

Well, I was thinking...

I have a meetin'
with CPS next week.

And I was thinking
you could come with me

and we could tell
the case worker...

Her name is Mary-Anne,

she's real nice and she's
trying to help me out.

And we can tell her about how
things are going well here

and, you know...

Like you and me,
and all...

(SPUTTERS, RUBS HANDS)

'Cause, I mean,

if things are going well
with you and me and all,

and I can get
a clean test...

And that's gonna happen?

No wonder they took him,

you're right back to where you
were in '08 all over again.


Where's his dad
in all this shit anyway?

Why doesn't he step
the fuck up? Seriously.

Or better yet,
why doesn't Leondria go with you,

being that she's so concerned
with our fucking business.

You know what,
fuck this place.

I'm going to go watch TV
with your mom.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

STRAWBERRY:
Don't judge, okay?

MIKEY: Why would I do that?

You're talking to a boy
who grew up in Texas City,

so I'm not going
to judge anything.

This is it?
STRAWBERRY: Yeah.

MIKEY: Oh. Uh, I take it back,
this place is a shithole.

Can you take me
home, please?

(STRAWBERRY LAUGHS)

All right, ta-da.

Wow. Luxurious.
Yeah.

Can't smoke in here,
by the way,

my mom's trying to quit.
That's okay.

Is this you?
Yeah.

That's the first selfie
I ever took.

Mm.
Vintage.

You want a Coke?
Yes.

And that's your mom?

Yep. And that's my
grandma, and that's me.

And that's me.
And that's me.

Cute.

What's back here?

Ah, that's my mom's room.
Oh.

I am right here.

Wow. Wow.

Pink.

Pink.

It's supposed to make you
happy or something.

Yeah.

Wow.


So, tell your mom
I'm moving in.

(STRAWBERRY LAUGHS)

(WAVES CRASHING)
(SEAGULLS CALLING)

You feel the sunshine?

MIKEY: By the way,
what sign are you?

STRAWBERRY: Why?

MIKEY: Uh... I mean,
I don't even believe in astrology,

but I'm just asking.

STRAWBERRY:
A bad sign.

(BOTH LAUGH)

I don't believe
in that shit, either.

MIKEY: Yeah.

You know, before this
place was about black gold,

it was about black ivory.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

I don't understand.

Slave trade, silly.
Oh.

Slaves were sold here.

Some, like, famous
French pirate ran the show.

A French pirate?
I bet he had really good style.

(LAUGHS)
I bet he dressed good.

When I was little,
my mama would take me out here

and we'd go hunting
for pirate booty.

Ooh.
(LAUGHING)

I love pirate booty.
STRAWBERRY: Ooh.

Tell me more.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)


I'm coming to get ya.
(GASPS)

(MOANING)
MIKEY: Fuck!

(FOOD SIZZLING)

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

This is prime Texas beef
right here.

This might be the one thing
this place has above LA.

Besides you, of course.
(GIGGLES)

You're like an
extraterrestrial around here.

When I look at you,
I don't think Gulf Coast,

you know...
Well, besides the sexy drawl.

You jerk.
It's not that bad.

It's pretty bad.
(CHUCKLES)

Stop makin' fun of me.

I'm not.
I had one, but I lost it,

after living in LA for a
while, you lose it.

I remember being at work
when I first got there,

these guys made fun of me
'cause I was like,

(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
"Hi, I'm Mikey."

And they all said,
"You sound like a dumb hick."

So, yeah, just lost it.

Well,

another year or so
and I'm out of here.

Why wait?
I told you. Moolah.

I didn't have any money
when I left.

I have no friends.
No connections.

I'll be your friend.
I'll be your connection.

Don't fuck with me.

I'm not.

(SOFT HIP-HOP MUSIC

Mm-hmm.

Hold up. (GRUNTS)
I got an idea.

Whoa,
what are you doing?

Let's shoot a scene, for us.
Just for us.

(STRAWBERRY SIGHS)

All right, but if we do that,
we're using my phone.

Why, you don't trust me?

Well, you could lose
your phone, motherfucker.

You could lose your phone,
motherfucker.

Well, then it would be on me.
Mm, true dat.

(LAUGHING)
Look at that, look at that.

You see that, you see
how good you look?

(STRAWBERRY MOANING)

You film here, take it.
Take it.

(CHUCKLES)
MIKEY: Mm-hmm.

(MOANS, CHUCKLES)
MIKEY: Yeah.

(STRAWBERRY MOANING
OVER PHONE SPEAKER)

That's so hot.
I know.

You're telling me.

Look at that,
look at that,

you know how to play to
the camera and everything.

You see how you make sure
your face is always seen

and you're aware
of the camera?

That's skill right there.
That's crazy.

If this doesn't show you
that you can be a star,

I don't know what will.

You really think so?
I know so.

STRAWBERRY: Hmm.

I'm not into that
swinger stuff though.

Swinger stuff?
Yeah.

I like fucking you,

and I don't want to fuck
anybody else.

And I don't want to think
about you fucking other girls.

(MIKEY CHUCKLES)

It'll be just us.

It's called
"couple scenes."

It'll be exclusive,
just me and you.

Getting paid to do
what we just did.

Shit, you would
have made $2,000

for that video right there.
Mm.

How many times did you come?
Three times.

You would have been paid two
grand to come three times.

I'm not
that good at math,

but that's
a really good deal.

I have to
sleep on it,

but it's not like I don't
already have the porn star name.

Right?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

You play?

No, I eat off of it.

You're such a smart-ass.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

Yeah, since I was six.

I was in this

Now, if you want me to keep
paying for rent and food,

shut the fuck up!

And I'm not cleaning
that shit up, either!

(DOOR OPENS)

She's in, man.
She's fuckin' in!

LONNIE: Yeah? She's in?
Yeah.

I'm still ironing out
the details, but guaranteed,

I'll have her shooting scenes
by September, baby!

That's pretty impressive
though, man.

Three weeks, you convinced
a girl to do porn?

Like, what the fuck. (LAUGHS)

I couldn't convince
my first girlfriend

to give me a blowjob
for three fucking years.

(LAUGHING)
Hey, man,

what can I say, baby,
I'm good at what I do. Ha-ha!

So that means
you're going to be leaving?

Yeah, I'm leaving.

Well, when are you leaving?

Basically,
I need enough to float us

until she starts shootin'.

I'm thinkin' I could have that
by the end of August, easy.

Dude, it's going to suck
for you to go.

I know, man,
it's going to suck

not hanging with you,
anymore, Lonnie.

You're my guy!
But, dude,

I'm on top of my game
right now,

on, like, every single
possible level.

Physical stamina,
my mind is sharp.

Now that I'm making money,

I'm taking 5-HTP
for serotonin in my brain.

with my skill and ability

and my eidetic memory shit,

there's no denying
what I could do.

The universe
is on my side, bro.

Yeah?

Strawberry!
Huh? You like that?

I do, yeah.

Just Strawberry.
No need for anything fancy,

all the biggest celebrities

Cher. Prince. Madonna.

Ooh, I'm getting a LLC
for Saber Entertainment.

Yeah?
I had a DBA for Mikey Saber,

but, uh, I didn't pay my annual
fees, so it expired,

and I had a falling out
with my old business partner.

But I do have
Mike Saber trademarked.

That's cool.
Yeah.

Oh, it's going to be a big

Yeah, dude.

your 18th birthday
in LA with me.

I want you to follow your
destiny, and I wanna be

right there next to you
to help you follow it.

So what do you say?

Let's start
a new life together

and get the fuck outta this
dead-end shit-hole town, okay?

Do you mean, like, now?

Well, we'll leave tomorrow

and we'll be in LA
by Monday, babe.

Oh, my God! Mikey!

I think I'm dreaming!
Me, too!

Ms. Phan,
I have to quit.

I love you guys,
but I'm going to LA with Mikey.

Thank you for all the free
donuts, Ms. Phan.

(DOOR OPENS)

You got a car?
Oh, I mean get a taxi.

I'm gonna have
a taxi pick us up

and take us
to the station,

and we're taking a bus
to Hollywood, baby.

Okay.
So just be packed

and ready to go at 10:00,
but just bring one bag,

'cause when we get to LA,

we're going to buy
all new shit.

Mikey?
Yeah?

You make me so happy.

(INDISTINCT TV CHATTER)

Hey.
Hey.

LEXI: Mm-hmm.

(TV CHATTER CONTINUES)

(LAUGHING)
(MIKEY CHUCKLES)

Is Lil here? She's...
She's sleeping.

(MIKEY CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

(CLEARS THROAT) Uh...

It's been
a crazy month, huh?


Poor Lonnie.

Oh, God, so sad.
So fucked up.

I hope he's all right.
Yeah, me, too.

(TV CHATTER CONTINUES)

(CLICKS TONGUE) Uh...

Yeah, it's just
been so wild,

we've been fighting
and all that stuff.

Yeah.

I'm not...
I'm not really in the mood.

Huh?

I'm not really in the mood
to mess around.

Oh.

Yeah.
Just saying.

Okay.
Okay.

Just been fighting a lot,

been a lot of drama
lately. And, uh...

(TUTS, INHALES DEEPLY)

We don't want to fight,

I know you don't want that.
I don't want that.

So...

Yeah.

Look, I'm...

I'm just gonna tell ya,

I'm going back to
California in the morning.

So...

You're going back

to California.
Yeah.

I got some work,

so that's good.
And...

Uh...
(CLEARS THROAT)

You know, this has not
been going good with us.

It's so much drama,
throwing coffee pots.

We don't need that,
you know. And...

But this has been fun.

You know, we had some good times.
I know...

Just feels like, uh...

Just feels like it's time to
go, you know?

I'm sure Lil's ready for me to go.
I... (SIGHS)

Yeah.

I don't want
to fight with you,

you know what I mean,

but we had good times,
as always.

And thank you
for the hospitality.

It's been great.
So...

You know, I wanted to
tell you and Lil together,

but I guess I could just
tell her in the morning,

before I go.
Or if I...

I don't see her,
I can...

I'll call her or something,
and thank her. But...

So I'm gonna go to bed.

(MIKEY INHALES SHARPLY)

Okay? We're good?

JUNE: Man, you ain't

ERNESTO: Shut up.

We need a meeting.

Now back to you.

Yeah, yeah,

Whatever you wanna call it.
It's over with.

That was between me and Lexi.
Seriously, what the fuck.

LEONDRIA:
At the end of the day,

it's about you getting up
out of Texas.

It's time for you
to bounce.

Yeah, I'm fixin' to,

but I was gonna leave
in the morning,

I need money
to do that.

Well, maybe you could go sell
one of your fuck trophies.

ERNESTO: Hey,
watch your mouth in front of Mom.

What's wrong with you?

LEONDRIA:
Did you give him his 200?

I was, but then his punk-ass
jumped out the window.

Two hundred, that's it?

That's enough
to get you a bus ticket

far beyond the state line.

After everything
I did for you.

Two hundred. Wow.

Be gone by midday.

LIL: Thank your mom for me.
I sure will.

Maybe you oughta come
by our house sometime.

Yeah, that would be nice.

Oh, that would be great.

LEXI: Yeah, you should.

Fuckin' bullshit.
LEXI: Like a hobo.

Threw my clothes in there

LIL: Really?

I'm sure he deserved it.
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

MIKEY: I'm gonna take my time.
