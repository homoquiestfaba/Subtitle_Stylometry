I COMPILED A DOSSIER

FOR LUNCH PERIOD.

WHAT'S UP, MAN?

WHAT'S GOING ON?

PRETTY SIMPLE DAY,
YOU KNOW?

OK, GIRLS IF

I'M CAPTAIN OF
THE CHEER SQUAD,

A GREAT DANCER, OH,
AND I LOOK SPECTACULAR

IN ALL
SPRING COLORS.

YOU HAVE IMPRESSIVE
QUALIFICATIONS, JULIE.

BUT I DO HAVE
ONE QUESTION FOR YOU.

SURE, ANYTHING!

WHAT IS THE NAME
OF GOTHAM MAN'S ARCH-ENEMY?

I'M SORRY?

<i>GOTHAM MAN?
PROTON COMICS?</i>

CREATED BY ARTIST STEWART BICKFORD IN 1947--

RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.

THE SUPERHERO.
BUT WHY ARE YOU--

LOOK. LOOK. LOOK.

DO YOU KNOW THE NAME
OF HIS ARCH-ENEMY OR NOT?

SURE! IT'S...
I THINK...

CHARLIE.

THANKS, JULIE.
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. NEXT!

WAIT! FRANK?

JIM? TIM? EUGENE?

CAN'T THIS BE MULTIPLE CHOICE OR SOMETHING?

OK, NEXT!

SUPPORT THE LOCAL
ANIMAL SHELTER.

THE SHELTER IS
IN DESPERATE NEED

OF RENOVATIONS
AND VOLUNTEERS.

PLEASE, TAKE A FLYER.

OH, EMILY!
SURE, I'LL TAKE ONE.

OK, LOOK.

FIGG, THIS IS
THE LIST OF COMICS

I NEED YOU
TO PICK UP FOR ME. OK?

OK.

THANKS LOADS, CALVIN.

OH, AND THAT'S
A TRICK QUESTION.

GOTHAM MAN'S ARCH-ENEMY
HAS NO NAME.

PLEASE SAVE
THE ANIMAL SHELTER!

HI, THERE.

I'M SORRY, EMILY.

YOU KNOW HOW SHORT
WE ARE IN FUNDING.

WE JUST DON'T
HAVE THE SPACE.

PLEASE, MR. DUDLEY,
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME!

I KNOW THAT I CAN
FIND TYCHO A HOME!

HI, THERE, BUDDY.
HEY, TYCHO.

TYCHO?
EMILY, WE TALKED ABOUT NAMING THE ANIMALS.

IT JUST
MAKES IT HARDER WHEN...

THINGS DON'T WORK OUT.

BUT I'VE BEEN
WORKING WITH HIM,

TRAINING HIM.

HE'S REALLY VERY SWEET.

AND... I TAUGHT HIM A TRICK.

HEY! HEY!

UM, NO, STOP IT.

UM, THAT WASN'T
THE TRICK.

EMILY, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

WE CAN'T SAVE 'EM ALL.

IT'S OK, TYCHO.

WE'LL FIND YOU A HOME.
I PROMISE.

YOU KNOW,
IT'S MY DREAM

<i>TO GET
GOTHAM MAN</i>

YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

<i>THE DARK DRAGON
CHRONICLES</i>

REPRESENTS THE PINNACLE
OF THE GOTHAM MAN LEGACY.

BUT I MEAN,
THE ORIGINAL GOTHAM MAN,

HE'S, LIKE--

HEY, CALVIN!
POP-A-WHEELER!

WE NEED
TO TALK, MAN.

HEY, MAMA.

HEY, SWEETIE.

DON'T MIND IF WE USE THIS SPACE A LITTLE BIT,
DO YOU?

NO, YOU GO AHEAD, BABY.

CALVIN, HAVE A SEAT.

OK. SEAT?
THAT AIN'T GONNA HURT.

LISTEN, MAN.

TONIGHT IS THE LAST

6 1/2 POINT FAVORITES.

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

WESTLAKE SOMEHOW GOT
A HOLD OF OUR PLAYBOOK,

AND THEY'RE GONNA KNOW ALL OF OUR SCHEMES.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

HEY, WHAT'S THAT
GONNA COST US?

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T JUST DO IT

IN THE NAME OF
GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP?

YOU KNOW, SCHOOL SPIRIT?

'CAUSE I KNOW YOU, CALVIN.

OK, GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

COME ON, FIGG.

HOOK ME UP, MAN.

WE WOULD
LIKE TO THANK

THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY
OF BEDFORD JUNIOR HIGH

WHO CAME OUT HERE
FOR THIS SEASON

TO SUPPORT US.

COME ON, Y'ALL.

BUT WE COULD NOT
HAVE DONE THIS

WITHOUT THE HELP
OF A VERY,

VERY SPECIAL FAN.

WE ARE DEDICATING
THIS ONE TO HIM.

THIS IS
SO EMBARRASSING.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

IT WAS NOTHING, REALLY.

IT WAS THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

CALVIN WHEELER!
GIVE IT UP, Y'ALL!

HEY, MOM. HI, DAD.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

DID SOMEBODY DIE?

MM-HMM.
MR. GRADE POINT AVERAGE.

MY GRADE
POINT AVERAGE? HMM?

NO WAY,
THAT CANNOT BE MINE.

I AM PASSING
EVERY CLASS.

NO, YOU ARE BARELY
PASSING EVERY CLASS.

YOU'RE DOING
JUST ENOUGH TO GET BY.

AND NOT JUST AT SCHOOL.

TAKE THE GARBAGE,
FOR EXAMPLE.

WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

DID LOU AND THRASH FORGET
THE LAWN TRIMMINGS?

YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOTTA TALK TO THEM.

YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT, CALVIN.

WE ASKED YOU
TO TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT.

ALL YOUR TEACHERS SAY
YOU'RE BRIGHT AND POPULAR,

BUT THAT IS
NOT ENOUGH, CALVIN!

LOOK, WE WANT YOU TO GO TO COLLEGE,
HAVE A REAL FUTURE,

BUT THAT'S
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

IF YOU KEEP TAKING
EVERY SHORTCUT YOU CAN.

ISSUE 1 TO GO.

THAT WAS
A GOOD ONE.

WHAT'S UP, FIGG?

FIGG? FIGG, YOU OK?

NONG'S COMICS. MAIN
STREET GO!

THAT...

THAT CAN'T BE
WHAT I THINK IT IS.

<i>1947.
GOTHAM MAN.</i>

<i>NUMERO UNO.</i>

EDITION ONE.

BUT...

THERE'S ONLY
8 KNOWN COPIES

IN EXISTENCE.

LOOK AT
THE PRICE, CALVIN.

$3,000?

THERE'S NO WAY.

YOUR CURRENT NET WORTH
IS $144.63.

SO, THAT MEANS
I'LL NEED TO RAISE...

LESS 3,000.

$2,855.37.

NOT INCLUDING TAX.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

IT'S WHAT?

WHAT DO WE SAY
ABOUT "THE IMPOSSIBLE?"

OK. OK.

EXPECT... THE IMPOSSIBLE!

FIGG! GET DOWN!

ALL RIGHT.

CAREFUL.

NOT THERE,
YOU DUFUS.

JACQUES AND I
NEED A FULL 100 FEET

FOR OUR TRAINING.

JACQUES!

AAH!

GET AWAY FROM JACQUES!

OH, JACQUES,
MY PRECIOUS.

DID THAT BAD,
BAD BOY HURT YOU?

ARE YOU CRAZY?

THAT LITTLE RAT
OF YOURS ATTACKED ME.

THIS... RAT...

HAPPENS TO BE JEAN JACQUES ST.
GERMAINE DE DUPREE.

HE'S AN AWARD-WINNING
PURE-BRED TERRIER.

WE'VE WON
ROYAL HOUND DOG FOOD'S

TOP DOG INVITATIONAL
2 YEARS IN A ROW.

CONGRATULATIONS.

IF I EVER DECIDE
TO GIVE A FLYING WHOOP,

I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

YEAH?
WELL, WHOOP ON THIS.

FIRST PRIZE IS $5,000.

COULD YOU REPEAT THAT?

$5,000.

WE DEFEND
OUR TITLE IN 2 WEEKS

AT THE BEDFORD
CIVIC CENTER.

ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL
HOUND TOP DOG RULE BOOK,

THEIR INVITATIONAL FINALS IS HELD ONCE A YEAR.

IN ORDER TO QUALIFY,

YOU HAVE TO
PLACE FIRST

IN AT LEAST
ONE REGULAR SEASON

TOP DOG EVENT.

WIN ONE EVENT TO QUALIFY?
NO PROBLEM.

SHH.

THAT GETS YOU AN
AUTOMATIC INVITATION

TO THE TOP
DOG FINALS.

IT'S A
FREESTYLE EVENT

JUDGED ON A SCALE
OF ONE TO 100.

THE OWNER OF
THE DOG MUST PERFORM

A 90-SECOND ROUTINE.

YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

TRICKS, ACROBATICS,

WHATEVER WILL
IMPRESS THE JUDGES.

SOUNDS LIKE EASY MONEY.
HA HA HA!

SHH!

YEAH, EXCEPT THE TOP DOG
SEASON IS ALMOST OVER,

AND WE HAPPEN
TO BE MISSING

SOMETHING
KIND OF IMPORTANT.

LIKE WHAT?

SHH!

A DOG.

THIS ONE'S 850.

850?

DOLLARS?!

CALVIN, THESE ARE
REAL, PURE-BRED DOGS.

THEY COST REAL MONEY.

YEAH, YEAH, WE NEED ONE
WE CAN GET REAL CHEAP.

WHAT'S THIS SAY?

CENTRAL CITY
ANIMAL SHELTER?

HELLO, THERE.

SUGAR WOOGAR.

HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

HELLO. HELLO,
LITTLE BUDDY.

CALVIN?

OH, HEY, EMILY.

SO, HOW DOES
THIS WORK?

HOW DOES
WHAT WORK, EXACTLY?

YOU KNOW!

ME, YOU KNOW,
GETTING A DOG.

YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
HOLD MY PUPPY

WHEN I BROUGHT HIM IN
FOR SHOW AND TELL

IN THE THIRD GRADE.

YOU REMEMBER THAT?

YOU SAID THAT
ANIMALS WERE DIRTY.

<i>YOU REMEMBER THAT?</i>

CALVIN, I HAVE
KNOWN YOU FOR YEARS!

YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING

UNLESS THERE'S
SOMETHING IN IT FOR YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

I THOUGHT MAYBE
ADOPTING A DOG

WOULD BE
GOOD FOR ME,

HELP ME TURN OVER
A NEW LEAF.

MAYBE I CAME TO
THE WRONG PLACE.

CALVIN, WAIT.

UM, THERE IS ONE DOG.

WHAT IS THAT THING?

I NAMED HIM TYCHO.

AW, HE LIKES YOU.

AW, GOOD BOY, TYCHO.

OK. LOOK. OK.

ARE YOU
ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY,

100 % SURE THIS IS
THE ONLY DOG AVAILABLE?

AAH!

TYCHO! NO!

GIVE ME THE SHIRT!
GIVE ME!

TYCHO, WILL YOU
LET GO OF HIS SHIRT?

PLEASE, TYCHO.

GIVE ME THE SHIRT.

OHH!

HE LOVES TO
PLAY TUG-OF-WAR.

TAKE HIM OR LEAVE HIM.

OH, AND DO ME A FAVOR.

DON'T BUY ANY ROYAL HOUND BRAND DOG FOOD

OR ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

THEY SPONSOR THESE
HORRIBLE DOG SHOWS

AND I CAN'T STAND SEEING
ANIMALS EXPLOITED.

OH, YEAH, TOTALLY. HEH.
ME, NEITHER.

OK, UM...

ALL YOU NEED IS A SIGNATURE
FROM A PARENT OR GUARDIAN.

THAT'S NOT GOING
TO BE A PROBLEM, IS IT?

NO, UH... OF COURSE NOT.

PROMISE YOU WILL
WORK HARDER NEXT SEMESTER?

I MEAN IT THIS TIME,
CALVIN. NO SHORTCUTS.

I'LL BRING UP MY MARKS,
I PROMISE, OK?

OK. NOW DON'T FORGET.
SIGN HERE...

AND RIGHT DOWN THERE.

HERE?

OK.

THANK YOU, MOM.

ECCH!

OK, OK.
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,
ABOUT GERMS?

NO, ACTUALLY HE SHOULD.

A DOG'S MOUTH IS CLEANER
THAN A HUMAN'S.

I FIND THAT VERY HARD
TO BELIEVE.

TYCHO!

COME HERE, BOY.

COME HERE. TCH TCH!

OK, NOW THIS IS MY
HOME NUMBER.

OK.

GIVE ME A CALL
IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

AND I'LL BE COMING BY
YOUR HOUSE IN ABOUT 10 DAYS.

REALLY?

YEAH. IT'S A STANDARD
POST-ADOPTION INTERVIEW.

JUST MAKE SURE THAT
YOU'RE FIT AS AN OWNER.

COOL.

COME ON, BUDDY.
COME ON.

CALVIN, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS DOG NOW.

YOU DO REALIZE THAT?

HEY, NO PROBLEM.

OOH!

OK, LET'S GO.

ALL RIGHT. GIDDY-UP!

NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

I'M NOT GONNA PULL YOU, OK?

<i>YOU ARE GONNA PULL ME, OK?</i>

OK. LET'S GO.

TYCHO! TYCHO!

TYCHO!

OH, TYCHO! AAH!

AAH! NO!

AAH!

OH, TYCHO!

COME ON, MAN.
IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

I DON'T KNOW, CALVIN.

LOOK, MAN, YOU WON'T
EVEN KNOW HE'S THERE.

WHY CAN'T HE JUST
STAY WITH YOU?

ARE YOU CRAZY?

MY PARENTS WON'T EVEN
LET ME HAVE A GOLDFISH.

<i>LOOK, MAN, THIS IS JUST LIKE
ISSUE 723 OF GOTHAM MAN,</i>

WHEN HE HAD TO TAME THOSE WILD
STAMPEDING BUFFALO MUTANTS?

YEAH, BUT GOTHAM MAN HAS,
LIKE, SUPER POWERS.

SO DO YOU.

YOU JUST DON'T
KNOW IT YET.

CALVIN. CALVIN,
YOU CAN'T BE SE--

HEY, MAN, YOU OK?

7 POUNDS.

THAT'S THE WEIGHT LIMIT
ALLOWED FOR PETS

AT MY APARTMENT COMPLEX.
7 POUNDS.

COME ON, FIGG, MAN,
I WAS COUNTING ON YOU.

<i>ISSUE 723 OF GOTHAM MAN.
REMEMBER?</i>

GOTHAM MAN'S LANDLORD NEVER
THREATENED TO EVICT HIM.

TYCHO'S, LIKE, 24 TIMES
OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT.

RIGHT. LET'S JUST
GET HIM IN HERE.

SHH! SHH! SHH!

GO! GO.

LATER, MAN.

LATER.

HEY!

HEY, HEY, HEY.

WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE, BUDDY?

YOU ARE A GUEST
IN MY HOME.

HEY, HEY, HEY.
SHH! SHH!

CONTROL YOURSELF.

OK, LOOK.
YOU SLEEP HERE. OK?

HEY! HEY.

YOU--OK, COME ON.

GET ON.

ALL RIGHT. SHH!

QUIET. OK?

THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

YOU JUST SLEEP--
YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU?

GO LIKE THIS.

GO JUST LIKE THIS.

SAY, YOU'RE SLICK.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

FINALLY!

OK? SEE? SLEEP TIME.

GOOD TIMES, GOOD TIMES.

OH! HEY. HEY, HEY.

HEY.

HEY, SWEETIE, ARE YOU OK?

HUH?

HEARD YOU SNORING
LAST NIGHT.

IT SOUNDED AWFUL.
ARE YOU GETTING A COLD?

UH... UH, YEAH.

I'M COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING.
'CHOO!

EXCUSE ME.

AND ONE MORE THING, CALVIN.

YOU'RE A GROWING BOY.
YOU REALLY NEED TO SHOWER EVERY DAY.

OK. THERE'S ONLY ONE
SANCTIONED EVENT LEFT

IN THE TOP DOG REGULAR
SEASON CIRCUIT.

IT'S OUR LAST CHANCE TO GET AN
INVITATION TO THE TOP DOG FINALS.

ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN IT.

"OWNERS MUST
LEAD THEIR DOGS

"THROUGH A SERIES

"OF RAMPS, TUNNELS,
AND WATER HAZARDS.

TIME PENALTIES WILL BE ASSESSED
FOR EACH MISSED OBSTACLE."

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

WELL, WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE
COMPETING IN THE DOG SHOW

WITH JEAN JACQUESQUISE,

ANCIENT DOO DOO,
I DECIDED TO PUT MY DOG IN THERE.

YOU MAY BE A BIG
DEAL AT SCHOOL,

BUT DOG SHOWS ARE
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

I WILL DESTROY YOU.

CHILL, PRESTON. LOOK, MAN,

I'M NOT TRYING TO STEP
ON ANYBODY'S TOES HERE.

OK?

YOU LISTEN TO ME
VERY CLOSELY.

WHATEVER SCHEME YOU'RE
PLANNING WITH THAT MANGY MUTT,

YOU BETTER JUST
DROP IT NOW. OK?

CONSIDER YOURSELF
WARNED.

HEY!

HEY, HEY, HEY.

OH--UNH!

NO, MAN!

I GOT HIM!

OHH...

UNH!

JACQUES!

TYCHO!

HELP ME, JACQUES,
PLEASE!

TYCHO!

OHH...

TYCHO! COME BACK HERE!

TYCHO!

OHH...

CHILLIN'.

CHILLIN' LIKE A VILLAIN,
MRS. WHEELER.

YEAH, CHILLIN'.

HEH. YEAH.

WHAT, MAN?
I HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

â™ª DID YOU EVER WONDER
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE â™ª

â™ª LOOKIN' UP FROM
THE KITCHEN FLOOR? â™ª

â™ª THEY PAT YOU ON THE HEAD
WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY â™ª

â™ª THAT'S THE WAY IT
FEELS WHEN YOU'RE A DOG â™ª

â™ª THEY KICK YOU OFF THE COUCH
AND TELL YOU TO STAY â™ª

â™ª AND PUT YOU OUT AND THEN
THEY LOCK THE DOOR â™ª

â™ª THEY NEVER UNDERSTAND
A WORD THAT YOU SAY â™ª

â™ª THAT'S THE WAY IT FEELS
WHEN YOU'RE A DOG â™ª

â™ª THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH
ABOUT THE WAY IT IS â™ª

â™ª WHEN YOU'RE A DOG â™ª

â™ª AND WHAT YOU REALLY WANNA DO
IS BE A BEST FRIEND â™ª

â™ª THAT'S THE WAY IT FEELS
WHEN YOU'RE A... â™ª

â™ª DOG â™ª

TYCHO?

TYCHO!

COME HERE, TYCHO.

SORRY MOTHER MOLASSES!

TY-TYCHO?

TYCHO?

TYCHO.

TY-TYCHO! DON'T YOU RUN.

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDIN' ME!

MAN, I GOTTA GET YOU
OUT OF SIGHT.

NO WAY.

OK.

COME ON. OK. OK.

COME ON. STAY. STAY.

JUST STAY, OK? STAY. STAY.

STAY. STAY.

CALVIN?

OH! HEY, GUYS!

I WAS JUST, UH, UM...

FIXING A SNACK.

WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED?

AND STOP FIDGETING.

I KNOW YOU'RE
UP TO SOMETHING.

ARE YOU OK, SON?

WAIT! WAIT!

THIS IS--
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

<i>WE CAN STAY HERE!</i>

<i>WE CAN STAY HERE.</i>

WE CAN STILL STAY HERE,
YEAH.

DAD, DAD, LOOK.

SEE, UM, I JUST--

JUST HAD A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OVER,
THAT'S ALL.

THAT'S ALL?!
CALVIN, LOOK AT THIS MESS.

IT LOOKS LIKE FOREIGN AGENTS
RANSACKED OUR KITCHEN

AND DIDN'T FIND WHAT
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.

THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK.

LOOK, LOOK.

LOOK, LOOK, UM--

LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN--

ALL RIGHT,
LET'S HEAR IT.

MM-HMM. OK.

THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
THIS IS ALL MY--

I'LL CLEAN IT UP--

HOLD ON, YOUNG MAN--

OK, DAD, I'LL DO IT,
I'LL CLEAN IT UP.

THINK ABOUT IT.

HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

HE DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE
ANY EXCUSES

AND HE DIDN'T
BLAME ANYBODY ELSE.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

I'VE EVER HEARD CALVIN
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR...

ANYTHING.

I'M SURPRISED HE EVEN KNOWS
WHERE WE KEEP THE MOP.

WE'LL LEAVE HIM.

OH--OH...

COME ON, TYCHO, COME ON.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

QUIET.

ALL RIGHT.

LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

TYCHO?

TY-TY-TYCHO?

TYCHO, MAN--

THESE ARE MY SNEAKERS!

NO. NO.

NO, NO, NO.

AND THIS IS MY GEOMETRY
HOMEWORK!

NOW, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

HOW LONG IT TOOK ME
TO DO THAT?

NOW, YOU TELL ME,
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY TEACHER--

MY DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK?

CALVIN! WHO ARE YOU
YELLING AT?

UH...

IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

YEAH, MOM!

I WAS JUST, UH...

DOING MY NIGHTLY
MEDITATIONS.

OHM... OHM...

OHM... OHM...

BREAKIN' THE HOUSE,
CHEWIN' UP MY SNEAKERS,

EATING MY HOMEWORK.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS DOG,

SO EVEN IF IT IS
ANOTHER WEEK...

WE ARE OVER.

YOU HEAR ME?

WE ARE OVER.

RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL

TYCHO IS GOING RIGHT BACK
TO THE POUND.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SHOW?

IT IS NOT WORTH IT.

CALVIN, HE'S YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY.

NOT ANYMORE.

HEY, CALVIN.

HOW YA DOIN', BUDDY?

WHAT'S UP, LEONARD?
WHAT'S UP, THRASH?

YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS GARBAGE DAY.

LOOK, THIS IS KIND OF
AWKWARD FOR US.

HOW DO I PUT THIS?

WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS--

WE GOTTA POUND ON YOU.

FIGG, MAN,
GET OUTTA HERE.

NO WAY!

IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL,
CALVIN.

YEAH, WE LIKE YA.
EVERYONE DOES.

BUT WE'RE GETTIN' PAID.

IT'S BUSINESS.

YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT.

I MEAN--CAN I
AT LEAST ASK WHY?

IT'S, UH,
PRESTON PRICE.

HE WANTS
YOU AND YOUR DOG

TO STAY AWAY
FROM THAT DOG SHOW.

AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO,
YOU KNOW,

ENCOURAGE YOU TO DROP OUT.

AND YOU KNOW HOW...

PERSUASIVE WE CAN BE.

LOOK, MAN,
NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY.

TELL PRESTON
I AM TAKING TYCHO

RIGHT BACK TO THE POUND
TODAY AFTER SCHOOL.

LOOK, WE STILL GOTTA POUND ON YOU.
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID.

YEAH. WE GOT ETHICS
AND STUFF.

SORRY, CALVIN.

THERE'S NO TALKING YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS ONE.

SO YOU WANT IT IN THE
FACE OR THE GUT OR WHAT?

SURPRISE ME.

WHAT IS THAT?!

OHH, NO!

AAH!

OH! MAN! ARE Y'ALL OK?

YOU STUPID DOG!

COME ON, BUDDY! COME ON!

HA HA HA!

HEEL!

OHH...

I'VE BEEN MEANING TO FIX THAT GATE FOR MONTHS.

SO LET'S RECAP.

OUR SON IS JUST
SPONTANEOUSLY

DOING WORK AROUND THE HOUSE

WITHOUT EVEN BEING TOLD?

I DON'T THINK
IT'S OUR SON.

HELLO?

YEAH, EMILY?

YEAH, IT'S CALVIN.

YEAH, UH,
SORRY TO CALL SO LATE,

IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

I COULD REALLY USE
SOME HELP WITH TYCHO.

WELL, NOTHING'S
REALLY WRONG.

IT'S JUST THAT...

HE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN I BARGAINED FOR.

OK, OK, SIT.

BAD DOG. BAD--

I SAID SIT!
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SIT MEANS?

YOU CAN'T JUST
YELL AT HIM!

HE'S DOIN' IT WRONG.

WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TEACHING HIM THE DIFFERENCE?

REWARD HIM WHEN
HE DOES SOMETHING RIGHT.

COME HERE.

COME HERE, TYCHO.
COME HERE.

OH, GOOD BOY!

YEAH, OK.

NOW SIT.

SIT.

YEAH! GOOD BOY!

THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

YEAH.

SO THAT'S IT?

JUST GIVE HIM FOOD?

A DOG NEEDS MORE
THAN JUST FOOD.

YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM
ENCOURAGEMENT,

PATIENCE, APPROVAL.

AND IF YOU REALLY WANT
A DOG TO RESPOND TO YOU,

YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM LOVE.

YEAH, WHO'S A GOOD BOY?!

â™ª COOLIN' DOWN MY WORLD â™ª

â™ª WITH THE BALL AND CHAIN
WITH YOU â™ª

â™ª CALLIN' DOWN THE CLOUDS â™ª

â™ª AS THEY TRY TO SPOIL
THE VIEW â™ª

â™ª AND THEN CAME YOU â™ª

â™ª THE SUN IS SHINING ON IT
ANYWHERE â™ª

â™ª THE LIGHT FIELDS FALL
IN SATURN'S RINGS â™ª

â™ª WHEN TOGETHER,
WE'RE AS LIGHT AS FEATHERS â™ª

â™ª ON A FALCON'S WING â™ª

â™ª EVERYBODY TELLIN' ME
THERE'S NOTHING NEW â™ª

â™ª OHH OHH â™ª

â™ª AND THEN CAME YOU â™ª

â™ª AND THEN CAME YOU â™ª

AND YOU HAVE TO
PUT ASIDE YOUR NEEDS

FOR WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE DOG.

RIGHT. RIGHT.

EMILY, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

FIRE AWAY.

HOW DID YOU KNOW GOTHAM
MAN'S ARCHENEMY WAS NAMELESS?

DUH. I READ THE COMICS.

<i>YOU READ THEM?</i>

OR DO YOU JUST SKIM
THROUGH THEM SOMETIMES MAYBE?

TEST ME.

OK, UH...

THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER
OF THE GOTHAM-MOBILE.

BEFORE OR AFTER IT GOT TOTALED IN ISSUE 533?

WHAT IS WITH
THE TRICK QUESTIONS?

HAVE YOU EVER JUST BEEN STRAIGHT
UP AND REAL WITH A PERSON?

NO.

NEVER.

PAR FOR THE COURSE.

FIGG, I AM TELLING YOU,

EMILY WAS JUST AMAZING
WITH TYCHO TODAY.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

I THINK WE HAVE
A GOOD CHANCE

OF WINNING THAT OBSTACLE
COURSE EVENT.

MOM'S HOME EARLY.

CALVIN, FIGG, STAY OUTSIDE!

THERE'S A BEAR
IN THE HOUSE.

IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'VE BARRICADED IT IN YOUR ROOM

AND I'M CALLING 911.

MOM, MOM, MOM,
CHILL, CHILL, CH--

SHH!

THAT'S NOT A BEAR.

THAT'S TYCHO.

MY DOG.

YOUR WHAT?

IT HAS TO GO BACK
TO THE POUND.

NOW, HOLD ON.

I HAD A DOG
WHEN I WAS A KID.

SKINNY LITTLE THING.
FOLLOWED ME HOME ONE DAY.

MY MOM AND DAD
LET ME KEEP IT.

WELL, HONEY,
IT'S VERY SWEET, BUT I JUST...

YOU KNOW... THE FUNNY THING
ABOUT HAVING A DOG--

THEY'RE A REAL PAIN.

DESTROY EVERYTHING IN SIGHT,

PEE ON THE RUG,
SLOBBER EVERYWHERE.

BUT YOU LOVE 'EM ANYWAY.

SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS
WOULD BE GOOD FOR CALVIN.

I'M SAYING THAT...

LOVE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SHORTCUTS.

OK...

TYCHO...

CAN STAY.

REALLY?

YAY! THANK YOU, MOM!
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, DAD.
THANK YOU.

NOT SO FAST.

THERE'S STILL
THE LITTLE MATTER OF YOU

TRICKING YOUR MOM INTO
SIGNING THE ADOPTION PAPERS.

OH, YEAH. HA HA!

GUESS I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
JUST SLIPPED MY MIND, YOU KNOW?

NO TV,

NO CELL PHONE.

FOR 2 MONTHS.

AND YOUR GRADES
BETTER START...

GETTING BETTER.

THEY WILL, DAD!
I PROMISE.

YOU CAN STAY.
YOU CAN STAY.

â™ª I'M â™ª

â™ª A DOG â™ª

â™ª I'M â™ª

â™ª A DOG â™ª

â™ª ONLY ONE CHANCE
TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME â™ª

â™ª YOU GET YOURS
WHEN I GET MINE â™ª

â™ª 'CAUSE I'M â™ª

â™ª I'M A DOG â™ª

â™ª CHASE â™ª

â™ª YOUR TAIL â™ª

â™ª CHASE â™ª

â™ª YOUR TAIL â™ª

â™ª RUNNIN' AROUND
IN THE STREETS ALL DAY â™ª

â™ª FIND THE ANSWER
OR I MIGHT JUST STAY â™ª

â™ª STAY A DOG â™ª

GOOD LUCK, LITTLE GUY.

IT'S OK, TYCHO.

IT'S JUST A BAD DREAM.

YOU'RE SAFE WITH ME.

TOP DOG STANDARDS.

CLEAN FUR, CLIPPED NAILS.

HE'S RIGHT.

YOU'LL NEED TO GET
A JUDGE TO SIGN OFF ON THIS

BEFORE YOU AND YOUR...

ANIMAL CAN COMPETE.

YOU HAVE STALL 14.

GOOD LUCK.
YOU'LL NEED IT.

OHH...

ALTERNATE DOG UNIVERSE,

CALVIN, THESE DOGS
HAVE ENTIRE TEAMS

OF PROFESSIONAL
GROOMERS.

SO? WHAT DO WE HAVE?

ONE COMB.

THE EVENT BEGINS
IN ONE HOUR.

WE'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE
TYCHO READY IN TIME.

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE
BEEN OVER THIS, FIGG?

MAN, YOU HAVE REALLY GOT TO
LEARN TO EXPECT THE IMPOSSIBLE.

RONDEL?

YEAH, WHAT'S UP, MAN?
IT'S CALVIN.

TOP DOG DEFENDING CHAMPIONS

PRESTON PRICE AND JACQUES.

YEAH!

LOOK AT THAT.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT,
HOLLY.

THIS IS CALVIN AND TYCHO'S
FIRST COMPETITION,

BUT CLEARLY THEY HAVE
UNLEASHED A TEAM OF STYLISTS

THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

BORDEN HAIR SALON.
FIFTH AND MAIN.

HONEY. HONEY?

YOU NEED TO COME SEE ME.
OK?

THIS IS
AN EVENT THAT FAVORS

SMALLER, MORE AGILE
ANIMALS, CHUCK.

UNLESS TYCHO IS A LOT MORE
FLEET OF FOOT THAN HE LOOKS,

THIS WON'T EVEN BE CLOSE.

JACQUES AND I ARE GONNA TEACH
YOU AND YOUR MUTT A LESSON.

WELL, UH...

I'LL JUST SEE YOU AT THE FINISH LINE, PRESTON.

DOGS READY.

HANDLERS READY.

TYCHO IS CRASHING
THROUGH THE OBSTACLES

LIKE THEY AREN'T EVEN THERE.

OK, THAT'S COOL.
WE CAN STILL DO IT.

OHH!

WE CAN DO IT.
COME ON.

GO, GO.
GO, GO, GO. OHH!

OHH!

OHH!

OHH!

THEY'RE TUNNELING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

THAT LITTLE DOG
IS STILL IN THE LEAD.

HE IS SO CUTE.

OHH! WHOA! OH!

AAH, AAH, AAH.
THAT'S MY SHOULDER!

SPLISH SPLASH,
HE'S TAKIN' A BATH.

THAT DOG
IS DOING SWIMMINGLY.

THINK THAT'S THE DOGGIE
PADDLE, CHUCK.

TYCHO! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

UNH! AAH!

TYCHO! NOOOO!

OHH!
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO SHAKE THAT ONE OFF.

JACQUES!

COME ON!

WHERE'S MY DOG?!

OH, JACQUES, ARE YOU OK, JACQUES?
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

TYCHO TAKES THE LEAD.

OH!

TYCHO, WAIT!
TYCHO, NO! NO!

JACQUES,

COME. HEY, JACQUES.

AN AWARD-WINNING DOG.

GET OFF OF MY DOG!

THEY'RE DIGGIN' UP
SOME TROUBLE NOW, CHUCK.

IT'S PAN-DOG-MONIUM.

THIS IS DOGGONE EXCITING.

A CANINE CATASTROPHE.

JUDGES, WE HAVE
A VIOLATION. CODE RED!

THERE'S A RACE GOIN' ON!

TYCHO, WAIT!

WAIT FOR ME, TYCHO!

JACQUES!
JACQUES, COME OUT OF THERE THIS INSTANT!

HEEL! HEEL!

HIS WAY TO THE FINISH LINE.

DRAGGIN' THAT THING
LIKE A DRAGON, ISN'T HE?

OHH!

OHH!

OHH!

OH HO HO!

THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

JUDGES,
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

JACQUES AND I ARE FILING
AN OFFICIAL PROTEST!

JACQUES!

HOLLY, IT LOOKS LIKE PRESTON PRICE
HAS LOST CONTROL OF HIS ANIMAL.

I'VE NEVER SEEN A CHAMPION
THIS FLUSTERED, CHUCK.

BAD DOG!

HE'S GOT TO GET
TO THE FINISH LINE.

HE'S ALMOST THERE!

OH, YEAH!

COME ON, TYCHO.
COME ON!

DON'T STOP MOVIN',
TYCHO, KEEP MOVIN'!

PLEASE MOVE. JUST PLEASE MOVE.
I'M TRYING TO WIN THE RACE.

PRESTON PRICE
HAS JUST BEEN HIT

WITH A PENALTY
FOR CARRYING HIS DOG.

OH, THAT IS
GOING TO COST THE CHAMP.

COME ON! COME ON!

WHOA!

WHOO-HOO!

â™ª VICTORY IS OURS,
VICTORY IS OURS â™ª

OK, CHUCK,
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE JUDGES SOME TIME

TO TALLY UP ALL THOSE
PENALTIES HERE.

LOOKS LIKE WE'RE FINALLY
GOING TO GET A RULING

FROM THE HEAD JUDGE.

THE DOG IN LANE 2,

TYCHO,

COMPLETED THE COURSE
IN ONE MINUTE, 37 SECONDS.

AFTER CALCULATING
THE TIME PENALTIES

ASSESSED FOR MISSING
EVERY SINGLE OBSTACLE,

THE FINAL TIME

IS 2 MINUTES AND 6 SECONDS.

UNBELIEVABLE!

CALVIN WHEELER
AND HIS DOG TYCHO

HAVE JUST SET
A NEW COURSE RECORD.

WITH SOME VERY UNORTHODOX STRATEGY,
I MIGHT ADD.

JUST LISTEN. THE CROWD
IS BEGGING FOR MORE.

IT'S NOT FAIR.
HE CHEATED.

HE CAN'T JUST SMASH THROUGH
OBSTACLES LIKE THAT. COME ON.

THE WINNER IS
CALVIN WHEELER AND TYCHO.

OHH! OHH!

YEAH! HA HA!

THAT FIRST-PLACE FINISH

IS GOING TO SECURE
THIS UNKNOWN DOG

AN INVITATION TO THE TOP
DOG FINALS NEXT WEEKEND.

CALVIN WHEELER
AND HIS DOG TYCHO

HAVE JUST SHOCKED
THE DOG SHOW WORLD.

I'M CHUCK.

AND I'M HOLLY.

BOW-WOW FOR NOW.

TELL US HOW YOU FEEL!

WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

OK, OK. PLEASE,
ONE AT A TIME.

YOU.

<i>CHARLES NETWORTH,
PERFECT POOCHIE MONTHLY.</i>

SOME MEMBERS OF THE CANINE
PRESS CORPS HAVE ALREADY

CALLED YOUR DOG
TYCHO THE TERRIBLE.

WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE NICKNAME?

WELL, UH--HA HA--
IF THE SHOE FITS...

GET IT, THE SHOE?

<i>MANDY CALL,
FANCY CANINE.</i>

CALVIN, YOU AND TYCHO
HAVE NOW QUALIFIED TO ENTER

THE TOP DOG FINALS.

TWO-TIME DEFENDING CHAMP
PRESTON PRICE SAYS THAT

HE WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT.

ANY RESPONSE?

UM...

EXPECT THE IMPOSSIBLE.

THAT'S GREAT.

HELP ME OUT, FIGG.

NO PROBLEM.

CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

OK.

WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU AND CALVIN?

I MEAN,
YOU FOLLOW HIM AROUND LIKE YOU'RE A SERVANT.

WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE,

KIDS MADE FUN OF ME, YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE I HAVE ASTHMA.

AND CALVIN DIDN'T?

NO, HE DID.

HE WAS THE WORST ACTUALLY.

BUT WHY--

DO YOU REMEMBER
IN SECOND GRADE,

WHEN I HAD THAT REALLY BAD
ASTHMA ATTACK DURING RECESS?

OH, YEAH!

THEY CALLED THE AMBULANCE
AND EVERYTHING.

YEAH. I FORGOT
MY INHALER THAT DAY.

I JUST COULDN'T BREATHE.

EVERYBODY WAS STANDING AROUND
STARING AT ME.

THE KIDS AND THE TEACHERS.

BUT NOT CALVIN.

HE REMEMBERED THAT MR.
AGATHAPALS, THE JANITOR, ALSO HAD ASTHMA.

CALVIN RAN INSIDE,
GOT HIS INHALER AND BROUGHT IT TO ME.

CAME AND SAW ME EVERY DAY
WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

READ ME COMIC BOOKS.

<i>LET ME GUESS.
GOTHAM MAN.</i>

<i>GOTHAM MAN.</i>

<i>DARK DRAGON CHRONICLES.</i>

SO THERE REALLY IS A HEART OF GOLD IN THERE.

YEAH. IT'S JUST DEEP.

DEEP DOWN SOMETIMES.

HEY! I'M HERE
FOR THE FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEW.

AHH. WE'VE BEEN
EXPECTING YOU.

PLEASE...

HAVE A SEAT.

WHERE'S TYCHO?

THIS IS ABOUT HIM,
REMEMBER?

GOOD JOB!

HERE WE ARE.

AHH. LUNCH IS SERVED.

THANK YOU, TYCHO.

THANK YOU, CALVIN.

YEAH,
THANK YOU, TYCHO.

I MEAN,
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

<i>YOU DON'T HONESTLY THINK
THAT AVENGING ANGIE</i>

<i>IS A BETTER COMIC
THAN GOTHAM MAN?</i>

COME ON. BETTER ARTWORK,
BETTER STORYLINES,

MORE COMPLEX CHARACTERS.

LISTEN, LADY, OK?

<i>GOTHAM MAN IS
AN ICON.</i>

YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
JUST LUCKY THAT I'M HERE

TO EVALUATE YOUR
QUALIFICATIONS AS A DOG OWNER

AND NOT YOUR TASTE IN COMICS.

OR YOUR VIDEOGAME SKILLS.

THAT WAS LUCK.

YOU KNOW IT.

SEE YOU LATER.

UM, EMILY, UM...

THE SPRING DANCE
IS NEXT WEEK.

I WAS JUST WONDERING

IF YOU WANTED TO GO.

I MEAN...

WITH ME.

YOU HAVE VERY IMPRESSIVE
QUALIFICATIONS, CALVIN.

I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU, HOWEVER.

OH, YEAH, SURE,
ANYTHING.

DO YOU LOOK SPECTACULAR
IN ALL SPRING COLORS?

THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION
AND, UH...

YOU KNOW I DO.

PICK ME UP AT 8:00 THEN.

BUT STILL, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A FANTASTIC WEEKEND.

THE TOP DOG FINAL,
PRESENTED BY ROYAL...

OH, WELL, YOU KNOW---

NO, NO, NO, NO.
STOP.

COMES UP TOMORROW AT 3 p.m.

TWO-TIME DEFENDING CHAMPION
PRESTON PRICE SAYS HIS DOG JACQUES...

OF COURSE IT WOULD
BE HIM.

WILL TAKE ON THE NEWCOMER
CALVIN WHEELER

AND HIS DOG TYCHO, OR AS
SOME ARE CALLING HIM...

I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

THANK YOU, JIM.
IN LOCAL NEWS...

EMILY.

EMILY, WAIT.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH TYCHO

<i>AFTER YOU WERE DONE
USING HIM TO MAKE YOUR MONEY?</i>

TAKE HIM BACK TO THE SHELTER?

LOOK, NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS JUST THE WAY IT STARTED.

OH, BUT WAIT.
YOU'VE CHANGED.

YES.

NOW YOU HAVE A HEART OF GOLD
AND YOU REALLY LOVE TYCHO.

THAT'S IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

THEN PROVE IT.

DON'T ENTER HIM
IN THAT SHOW.

DROP OUT NOW.

GOOD-BYE, CALVIN.

CALVIN!

HEY, EMILY.

WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

TYCHO HAS A HOME.

HE HAS A FAMILY
THAT MISSES HIM.

LOOK. THEY'RE EVEN OFFERING
A REWARD TO GET HIM BACK.

HOW MANY FLYERS
DID YOU SEE?

THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE TOWN.

TAKE THEM ALL DOWN.

WHAT?

I'M--I'M NOT
LOSING TYCHO.

NOT NOW.

CALVIN, THIS IS HIS HOME.

HIS REAL HOME
WHERE HE BELONGS.

SAYS WHO?

CALVIN, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

IF YOU LOST TYCHO,
YOU'D WANT HIM BACK, RIGHT?

JUST DO IT, FIGG!

NOW.

NO.

WHAT?

WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO ME?

"HE'S SELFISH.

HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF."

THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL
SAY ABOUT YOU, CALVIN.

BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT THEY WERE RIGHT.

TILL NOW.

I WANT TO KEEP TYCHO
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

I KNOW YOU'LL DO
THE RIGHT THING, SON.

UM... YEAH, I HAVE YOUR DOG.

GREAT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

LOOK, HONEY!
IT'S CHESTER!

CHESTER.

OH, LOOK.

CHESTER! COME HERE, HONEY.

COME GIVE MAMA A KISS.

HA HA HA HA.
HA HA.

GO ON, TYCHO.

I MEAN...

CHESTER.

THANK YOU.

FOR BRINGING HIM
HOME TO US.

BILLY, GO GET THE REWARD.

NO, NO, NO.

KEEP THE MONEY. I--

I DON'T WANT IT.

JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.

YEAH, SURE.
NO PROBLEM.

STAY.

YOU HEAR ME?

STAY.

HEY.

HEY, WHERE'S TYCHO?

UM...

I TOOK HIM HOME.

BUT THE TOP DOG FINALS
IS TODAY.

I KNOW.

EMILY!

HEY!

GET OUT OF HERE.

I WANT YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

CALVIN GAVE TYCHO BACK
TO HIS REAL FAMILY

AND DIDN'T ACCEPT A REWARD.

WAIT A MINUTE.

YEAH.
YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF BAD THINGS ABOUT CALVIN.

THEY'RE PROBABLY TRUE,

BUT YOU CAN'T SAY HE DOESN'T LOVE THAT DOG.

THIS PHOTO OF TYCHO,
I TOOK IT.

NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

THAT WAS TAKEN
BY HIS REAL FAMILY.

UNH-UNH. LOOK.

I TOOK THIS PHOTO WHEN THEY FIRST
BROUGHT TYCHO INTO THE SHELTER.

BUT--BUT THAT MEANS THAT

THIS FLYER COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN PUT UP BY TYCHO'S FAMILY.

SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

CALVIN!

WHAT'S UP, FIGG?

LOOK AT THIS.

IT WAS PRESTON!

YOU KNOW WHAT?

HE MADE UP THOSE FLYERS
AND POSTED THEM HIMSELF.

HE DID IT ALL.

HE KNEW HOW MUCH
I CARED ABOUT TYCHO,

HOW MUCH I WANTED TO DO
WHAT WAS BEST FOR HIM

AND GET HIM BACK
TO HIS REAL FAMILY.

EXCEPT THEY'RE NOT
HIS REAL FAMILY.

THEY'RE PHONIES!

SO WHO ARE THEY?

THEY HAD TO BE SOMEBODY
PRESTON COULD CONTROL.

NOT THERE,
YOU DUFUS.

I KNEW THAT GUY
LOOKED FAMILIAR!

SO WHAT NOW?

NOW WE GET HIM BACK!

THAT'S TYCHO.

OH, MY GOODNESS.

I DON'T CARE
WHAT WE'RE GETTIN' PAID!

I WANT THAT BEAST GONE
AND I MEAN NOW.

WE SHOULD GET HELP.

FINE!

DUDE, THERE'S
NO TIME FOR HELP.

OK, FIGG,

YOU GO KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

KEEP 'EM TALKING, OK?

WE'LL SNEAK IN
THROUGH THE BACK.

I'M GONNA
GO WITH HIM.

NO, CALVIN,
WAIT A SECOND.

I--I'M NOT YOU.
I MEAN...

YOU KNOW, I'M
NOT GOOD AT LYING.

FIGG, DON'T THINK OF IT
AS LYING, OK? REMEMBER--

SHH!

<i>OK. DO YOU REMEMBER ISSUE 426
OF THE DARK DRAGON CHRONICLES</i>

WHEN GOTHAM MAN HAD TO
PROVIDE A DISTRACTION?

OH, SO THE JUSTICE LEGION COULD
SNEAK THROUGH THE DARK...

DRAGON'S LAIR.

I GOT IT. GOT IT.

LET'S DO IT.
LET'S DO IT.

TAKE
THE DOG AND--SHH!

GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.

I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY

TO SUBSCRIBE

TO THESE--THESE
LEADING MAGAZINES

AT A GENEROUS
DISCOUNT.

WHAT IS GOIN' ON,
BILLY?

SELLIN' MAGAZINES.

KID, WE DON'T WANT
NO MAGAZINES.

WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, BOY?

ARE YOU OK, HON?

WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

UGH!

I THINK HE HAS THE ASTHMA,

YOU KNOW, LIKE MY COUSIN GAYLE?

IF HE DIES ON OUR PORCH,

HE CAN PROBABLY SUE US
OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

SHUT UP, BILLY!

YOU FEELING BETTER,
HON?

MUCH. THANK YOU.

OH, TYCHO!

AAH!

HEY, FIGG, WHEN DO
THE TOP DOG FINALS START?

HAVE A ROUTINE.

I THINK WE MIGHT.

WHAT ARE THOSE,
CHUCK?

FLYING DISKS, HOLLY.

FANTASTIC!

OOH LALA, JACQUES!

WOW!

A FLAWLESS ROUTINE

IN THERE, CHUCK.

NEXT UP IS CALVIN WHEELER
AND TYCHO.

DON'T HOLD YOUR
BREATH.

THIS IS THE FINAL CALL

FOR CALVIN WHEELER

GOING TO BE A DISQUALIFICATION.

LET'S GO, BABY! WOW!

DON'T ROLL OVER YET.
LOOK!

OHH!

THERE, BABY!

OH, COOL!

WHOA!

OHH!

SURPRISED?

YOU AND YOUR NO-GOOD MUTT

FULL SPEED, TYCHO.

FULL SPEED.

HAVE ONE MINUTE
AND 30 SECONDS TO IMPRESS

THE JUDGES IN THIS
FREESTYLE EXHIBITION.

OF OUR DOG QUIXOTE DISPLAY.

THE AUDIENCE IS JUST
LAPPING THIS UP!

HOLLY, THEY'RE RACING
RIGHT FOR THE ARFUL TOWER.

AND THEY'RE THROUGH!

BOTH CALVIN
AND TYCHO ARE HEADED FOR

THE ANCIENT DRUID RUINS
OF BONEHENGE!

OH, WOW! NOW THEY'RE ON THE WAY
TO MOUNT RUFFMORE'S HALF PIPE!

AND THEY ARE MOVING!

GO, CALVIN!

DID YOU SEE THAT?
CALVIN JUST SKATED RIGHT OVER

THE WATERS OF
THE SOUTH PAW-CIFIC!

NOW THEY'RE HEADED
FOR THE BRIDGE TOO FUR.

CALVIN AND TYCHO ARE
GOING TO HAVE TIME

FOR JUST ONE MORE TRICK,
HOLLY.

THAT'S RIGHT, CHUCK,
AND THEY ARE PICKING UP SOME SERIOUS SPEED.

OHH!

OHH!

OHH!

AAH!

AND CALVIN STICKS
THE LANDING!

WELL, HOW I'D DO?

IT'S OBVIOUS
PRESTON SABOTAGED THE EVENT.

HE'S DISQUALIFIED.

PRESTON PRICE CHEATED.

THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

LET'S WRAP IT UP.

WE AWARD THE ROUTINE...

A 99!

THAT'S IT! FAME!

CALVIN WHEELER AND HIS
DOG TYCHO THE TERRIBLE

HAVE JUST WON ROYAL HOUND'S TOP DOG FINAL!

ALL RIGHT, CALVIN!

GO, BABY!
HOLD IT THERE, CALVIN!

TYCHO, CALVIN, THIS WAY!

GUYS, GUYS, PLEASE!

HOW PREPARED WERE YOU?

YOU.

<i>EMILY WATSON,
BEDFORD ANIMAL SHELTER</i>

<i>MONTHLY NEWSLETTER.</i>

YES?

CALVIN, I WAS WONDERING,

DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
FOR THE PRIZE MONEY?

I SURE DO.

AND JUST WHO WAS
STEWART BICKFORD?

<i>THE CREATOR
OF GOTHAM MAN.</i>

THESE RENOVATIONS WERE ONLY MADE
POSSIBLE BY A GENEROUS DONATION

FROM CALVIN WHEELER
AND HIS DOG,

A FORMER RESIDENT
OF THIS SHELTER,

TYCHO THE TERRIBLE!

YOU DID IT, CALVIN.

CUTE.
YOU'RE A CHATTY DOG.

YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO CHATTY
FOR OUR HOUSE.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

IF WE'RE EVER GOING
TO GET RUFUS A HOME,

WE'VE GOT TO WORK
ON HIS SOCIAL SKILLS.

RUFUS?

YOU KNOW WHAT MR.
DUDLEY SAYS ABOUT NAMING THE ANIMALS.

WHAT CAN I SAY? HE LOOKS LIKE
A LITTLE RUFUS TO ME.

GUYS, HE'S JUST
SCARED, THAT'S ALL.

HEY, BUDDY.

HEY, LITTLE GUY.

HIYA.

WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT.

FIGG, HE ACTUALLY
LIKES YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

I'D SAY 5.2,
MAYBE 5.3 POUNDS.

DEFINITELY UNDER THE WEIGHT
LIMIT FOR MY APARTMENT COMPLEX.

LOOKS LIKE AND TYCHO HAVE
SOME STIFF COMPETITION

FOR NEXT YEAR'S
DOG SHOW.

HA! PLEASE.

AFTER THE PERFORMANCE
TYCHO AND I GAVE,

I DON'T THINK THERE IS
A DOG ON THIS EARTH...

COME ON, BUDDY.

OK, THAT CAN--

OH, YES.

YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOY.
YES, YOU ARE.

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDIN' ME.

YOU KNOW WHAT, FIGG?

FIGG, WAIT.

HOW ABOUT
WE TEAM UP?

YOU, ME, OUR DOGS,
YOU KNOW?

WE CAN DO THIS KIND OF TAG TEAM TANDEM THING.

YEAH. I MEAN,
WE CAN'T LOSE.

AT THE VERY LEAST,

YOU GONNA NEED
A MANAGER.

YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE TO HELP YOU COUNT THAT MONEY.

MM-HMM. HE'S GONNA
BE OUR LITTLE STAR.
