Man, I ain't got time--

The nigga started

Oh, okay.

I wanna tell you.

Story?
About what?

Kentucky.
Now lay down

Oh shit

Use protection
and don't tell nobody!

They raped Earl?
No, man, he doesn't rape him!

Not all convicts are gay

Really?
You see, Wilbert is

headed upstate for life and he wanted
to share some of his secrets

with someone who could
benefit by them.

You like plants

[mm

Well, shit, it depends
on what kind of plants

you talking about.
There's a hidden part

in a rural part
of the highway of Kentucky

where there's nothing
but acres-- I mean acres--

of pot farm

Now that's what I'm talking
about right there.

That's right up my lungs

I'm talking about
the best weed you ever seen

Well, it's for a very--

Well, right on, boy
All right.

All right, carry on

Sit back and roll one

We don't make

Okay, well, fuck it.
Let me get a cheeseburger

We don't make cheeseburgers

Let me get
two of those motherfuckers.

You're pushing it, boy

-"Boy"?
Mm-hmm

Maybe we oughta just get up

Man, fuck that shit

This ain't no goddamn J. Edgar Hoover
back-in-the-'60s shit.

Is there a monkey talking?

How you doing, Run DMC?
You're in trouble now, ain't you?

Half a Dollar.
I understand that your little

tour rap bus
broke down up yonder

Now I heard you say you want
some kind of burger.

There's a McDonald's about three,
four miles up the road there.

You can get all
the chicken nuggets you want

and fruit punch Kool-Aid

And I'd advise you

to get your black asses up

and head the hell
on outta this town

We moved here
to move away from ya

Everywhere we move,

moving in, sending
the property value down

I'm about to drop

Whatcha gonna do, son?

Hey, fellas, would y'all

We good, we good.

We good.
Don't touch 'em

You might catch it

Touching you on the hand,
I tell you, the next time you know

your fingers turn black

Hold up, hold up, hold up

Hey, fellas?
Yeah, what's that?

I want to thank y'all again
for showing me the nice hospitality

Y'all showed me so much love
and I'm trying to figure out

which one of you cracker's jaws
I'm gonna let suck my black dick!

Holy Rick Astley shit!
Get them mother-crickets!

What? They are so fucked
right now, nigga.

It is a done daughter.
Them rednecks must've caught 'em,

then sodomized them
and murderized them.

Oooh

Man, what is it
with you and sodomy?

I mean that's the way
all these stories end, man

They fuck you
and they kill you

Nigga, ain't you seen "Deliverance
II?

No, they don't get screwed or killed

They get away

Itch, though, right?
I don't think so, man

Use Blue Star ointment?

But that don't usually work
most of the time.

No shit?
Not really

Gotta shave all the hair
off my nuts, huh?

I had to shave my asshole
Oooh.

Howdy, cowboys!
Welcome to the Dixieland Hotel

So tell me, how many
"D"s are in Dixie.

One.
No, darling!

There are 35.
DD-DD-DD-D-D-D-D-D-D--

Okay, you boys look exhausted

Like you've been out
on the range all day.

I'm gonna tell you
what you need: a good meal,

a hot tub
and a nice warm bed

to put that little head on

That's what I'm talking about.
You gonna come put me in the bed?

Sounds good to you, doesn't it?
Mm-hmm.

What's it gonna be?

Two rooms?
Or maybe one?

One.
And is that gonna be

two beds or one?

Bitch, two! What the fuck?
Two!

Okay okay, I got to ask.
It doesn't happen very often,

but every now and then we get
some of those life "partner" types

You know what I mean.
No, there ain't nothing like this

We're definitely not life partners
Okay.

Now y'all want smoking
or non-smoking?

Smoking

Smoking that weed
Feeling fine

Got me a party
And a fat-ass dime

How about
a little weed for me?

You a Compton sister.
Just go on upstairs and have a ball

All right, baby.
She all right to me

Boy, those chili cheese fries
was off the chain, man.

Oooh, for real. I think
she cooked them mothers herself

Yeah, man.
Mara's kinda feisty

She probably was fine
as fuck back in the day

If it was the '60s, shit, I'd fuck

While you're bullshittin' it
I'm fucking that.

Man, hold up, man. You smoked
too much for real this time, man.

You blowing my high, man

Oh shit

Man, it's the Kush
Oh, that's my shit

I ain't never seen
this shit before.

Man, watch, check it out,
while we be tripping.

I heard about this shit.
Here, smoke. You need to smoke

while you look at that
Okay.

And US veteran Akura Kushimota,

publically known as Master Kush
is wanted for murder.

Leading the investigation
is Special Agent Rico--

Yo yo yo yo,
that's some mad lies

Leader Kush never killed no one

Hey, true dat.
Get out, Kush

Get down! Smoke him

Move in, move in

Pull back, he's got a gun

It's weapons of mass destruction

Watch out!
It's the kush goo!

HEB?

Oh no, no-ooo!

Will Master Kush be hunted down

and captured by the ICU?

Will ICU propaganda
successfully tarnish

the good name of Kush?
Will the ICU

use their evil influence and release

the dark energy into the world?

Will fear, mass paranoia
and government conspiracy

be the ultimate downfall of Master Kush?

All this and more

When Kush Comes to Shove

That hurt.
M-M-Master Kush

I'm having a meeting with the toilet

You gonna have to hurry up, man

What you doing?

Making a decision

You gotta
come back later, man

Smoking up all the fucking weed
I know what he doing.

Free up your mind and pull up
some fresh brew

Blowing out my mind
cloud nine

Where I stay,
so I blaze some weed

We've been riding forever, man

I'm tired of this shit.
What time we gonna get there?

Man, you know what?
What?

Before we get to where we're going, man,
I think we need to get some new gear.

Think there gonna be
some mothers out there?

No, nigga. I ain't-- I'm talking
about some clothes so we can fit in

So we won't stick out
as much, man.

Like what?
What type of gear?

Shit, I don't know.
What do country motherfuckers wear?

Cowboy shit?

Yeah, I guess

Man, when we get
up in here, man,

make sure you play it cool

Don't be doing shit that'll
bring attention to us, man

Come on, dawg

I 9011 you

All of you freaks

And all of you boozers

All of you cheats

Emil

Yeee--

--haw

Hey there,
Boom Boom Belinda

Let me get some of that--
both of them.

It's another lost weekend
stuck in this town...

He ain't gonna need this

Hey, where you going?
Where you going?

Where you going?
Where you going?

You can get that two in that
corner pocket if you just go at it.

Smile!

I like that.
Let me get it

Okay, babe

Give them a little "Whoa,

ho ho ho!"

Hey, come on, man
You're crazy.

Listen to me.
You're tripping

Can I get you guys something to drink?
Yeah.

Let me get a li'l sarsaparilla

Knock off that cowboy shit

This ain't the place

Oh. My bad

Now if you're looking for some reefer,

stick around till after we close

For sure
Whoo.

Uh, was that drunk bitch pregnant

or was that pregnant bitch drunk?

Is that what I think it is?
Oh, yeah yeah.

Bring it here.
Come here, come on, come on in

Now let me guess.
You guys are here

looking for crops
How you know?

The only black cowboys I know

play football in Dallas

mama

Yeah well, shit.
What's up with the trees then, man?

My man here said they got acres
of that shit growing out here.

That's an understatement
Fuck.

Kentucky yields
the most marijuana crops

in the nation

If you're driving through,
just roll down your windows

You could smell it in the air
No shit.

I thought I smelled it.
When I was on my way up there

I did smell it.
That's 'cause we was smoking on one

You ain't wrong when you're right

Let me guess:
you guys came up in here

in hopes of finding
one of those crops?

Snatching a couple of pounds

and going down to sell it in the hood

You're damn right, Iron Sheik

Oh, I get it

You're the funny one.
Well, we'll see how funny you are

when one of these hillbillies
has a cow prod up your ass,

forcing you to drink ice water
and chew on aluminum foil.

My booty hole just started burning
What type of gay shit?

All right, man,
for real, man.

Can you tell us
where the crops are?

Well, you gotta be a little
more specific than that.

You just don't walk into McDonald's
and say "I want a hamburger."

You got the Barack Obama?
What kind they got?

EL Presidential
It all depends

on how far are you
willing to go.

I mean you can hike
for about a day

and find a pretty decent
chronic crop.

But if you're willing to dodge
a couple of bullets

and booby traps
Mm-hmm.

You can find that sticky green,

crystallized,

extraterrestrial-type shit

that shit that tastes like candy
when you smoke it.

Oh shit, I'm up in that

Man, did you hear what
he said before that shit?

Man, I'm not fucking with no bullets
or no booby traps, man.

Can you tell us how to get
to one of the ones, like,

right off one
of these roads somewhere?

All right, all right,
but trust me.

You'll be back

Can I get some
of that now? Shit

Y'all done passed it back and forth
like y'all know each other.

So what the guys didn't know

was that I was waiting
for this opportunity for years

What opportunity?
My sweet little baby girl

my daughter Marie--
she was held captive

by sick, sadistic hillbillies

A group of them
Oh, I get it.

So he get him a piece of that
young hillbilly kinootchi

while he up there, fuck around

and leave a seed
in the background, huh?

Exactly.
Should've pulled out

I'd do it.
Called the rhythm method

or some shit like that

I tried several times to free her,

but it didn't work out

Damn, that's fucked up

Yeah, so I seen these guys
as the perfect opportunity

to set her free, but first I had
to bait the hook a little.

Man, where in the hell
this fool Sanchez send us, man?

I don't know. He said
look for the Highway 420 sign

There it is right there
That's it right there.

Let's do this shit

Come on, let's go

You hear this shit?
This is the forest, nigga.

Man, let's just be rappers.
Let's go back home, let's be rappers

Man, come on, man.
Bring your scary-ass on, man

Let's go, man
Eh, shit!

Fucking with you

Okay, according to Sanchez,
there should be somewhere

to camp right up in here somewhere
Camp?! Hold up, hold up.

The fuck you mean "camp"?
Black people don't camp.

We cook out. We picnic

We party, have a good time,
get on that cocaine and leave

You got me fucked up, nigga.
I'm gonna stay out of this motherfucker

I ain't gonna be
on nobody's news. Shit

Man, you trying to get
this weed or what, man?

Now if I can remember correctly,
this was your idea from the beginning

Not this part.
Shit, man, I don't know about you,

man, but I'm tired of this
nickel-and-dime shit we've been doing

I'm trying to get
this paper for real, man

This right here could be
our meal ticket outta the hood

So what you want to do?

You should be a actor, man

'Cause I felt that. I felt like
the movie-- on "Menace ll Society

when he said "You gonna let
that nigga kill your cousin?

Let that shit ride?
Fuck that!"

That's how I-- whoa, shit.
What the-- you hear that shit?

Man, whatever, man
Come on, man.

No, but I'm for real though
I feel what you're saying.

Real good talk.
Pfft, that's bullshit, man

Man, what if we do come up?

What you gonna do
with all the brick?

Shit, first thing I'm a do, man,

I'm a get me a motherfucking
'58 Chevy Impala, nigga.

Put some bang in that bitch
throw some "D"s on that ho

You know, get it ready for the summer
You know what I'm saying?

I feel you, nigga
Yeah yeah.

Shit, after that though
I'll have to get me a spot

You know,
somewhere outside of the hood

where I don't have to worry about
catching a stray bullet in my sleep

Nigga, I definitely feel you
on that shit, nigga.

Shit.
What about you, man?

What you gonna do?

I might take Shante
on a trip to Jamaica

Probably sit on the beach
or some shit, chill out.

With a fat blunt of course
Mm-hmm.

Me sittin' there smoking a good one
and have her run into the water,

with a nice pretty thong

where I don't see nothing
but her ass just jiggling.

And then, shit

I gotta buy something
for the kids,

so I'll probably take all them
motherfuckers out to the toy store

and just let them ball till they fall
you know what I'm saying?

But I'm definitely moving out

You know what I'm saying?

Yeah, I know

I wonder is there a spot

like rich broke niggas.
You know what I'm saying?

Niggas that made a little money
made their way up out the hood

You know, I don't know.
There's gotta be somewhere

Baa,

It's been a long day.

Holla at you

Now my daddy's the judge

so I suggest you
show me some respect!

Man, I ain't saying nothing
until I talk to my lawyer.

Damn!
I hate that

Now you lookie here, Earl

You're looking
at a whole mess of jail time

And let me tell you,
those big hairy redneck convicts

sure ain't gonna go light
on your little black butthole

Unless of course
they take a shine to you

and they tell you that
you have a purty mouth

We call it "Deliverance 2

The Dark Side
No no no.

So tell me who you're with

The Gatsfields or the McRoys?

WEE

Don't play dumb with me, stupid

I'm telling you,
we have been watching

the McCoys and Gatsfields
for more than two years now

Neither one of these clowns
would have anything to do with them

Well, then who the hell are they?

Don't know.
Mutt and Jeff

Frick and Frack,
Fucking Kid 'n Play

Who gives a shit?
Let 'em go.

Come on, Earl. Suck it up.
Tell me whose pot farm it is

Yeah yeah!

Hey hey hey,

Come on.
What what?

Let him go!
You got the wrong guy

No no no, but he just confessed

Yeah, you scared him
half to damn death, man

Hey, my man, get outta here. Go go!
Huh?

Stop slobbering
and get your ass up outta here

-Me?
-Bye-bye.

You sure?

I can go.
Okay, I can go

Pussy!
Hey!

What are you doing, man?
Let me tell you something:

you are wasting our time, all right?

And you're bringing
too much attention to this investigation

with your hillbilly style of cop work

Lemme-- lemme tell
you something, my man,

this is how this is
gonna go down, okay?

You gonna leave
the drug bust to us,

while you stick
to writing traffic tickets

and breaking up domestic
disputes, you understand?

That's a pretty good accent
Thank you.

Yam

Yes.
Good

Feds

Look at Tony!
There's Tony.

Hell no

Told y'all we was innocent!

Yeah, nigga.
God damn it

It's just like the white male
trying to keep a brother down

Oh yeah, and I forgot to tell y'all

Minister Farrakhan said what's up

Alaikum assalam

Sign there

Where my EBT card at?
Hey, wait a minute.

Where are my keys, man?
You mean these?

Damn, did I forget to tell you?
No, you ain't getting 'em back.

What the fuck you mean
you ain't give me my keys, man?

Apparently you got expired tags
so we had to impound it.

My car?!
That's my car

Oh.
Now you boys are resourceful

I'm sure you'll have a long refreshing
walk all the way back to Compton.

Unless of course you want to stay.
We're gonna do some shooting later

No, we're good, we're good
Let's go, let's go.

Just gonna shoot
some cans is all. Jamai-cans,

Mexi-cans, Puerto Ri-cans

Afri-cans.

Now what the hell we supposed to do?
Shit, I don't know, man.

Shit, who the fuck can we call?

Now with no car, no money
and no way to get home,

I had them just where
I wanted them.

It was time to put
my plan in motion

Shit, I don't know

Hold up!

Sanchez

Fellas, back so soon?

Yeah, man, we're in
a real fucking bind now, man

They done fuck around
and pop me for my shit

and they took his car.
We barely got any money left, man,

and no way home now.
Man, what the fuck we gonna do?

I've already made preparations
for you guys to crash at my crib

I knew you'd be back
Your crib?

We ain't about to stay in your crib!
You see how this shit look?

You got Christmas tree lights
around this bitch.

I know your house look even worse

Baum
motherfucker?

Sanchez,

you, my friend, is living
hillbilly fabulous around this bitch

Hell yeah. Why you didn't tell us
you had shit like this?

Oh, you thought when I said
I was stuck here, it was all bad

Hell no. Come on,
I want to show you something

Right over here

You living lovely, Sanchez.

Hey, why don't you
tell us what it is, shorty?

Yeah, put me on some of this thing
you got going on around here.

Yeah.
Fuck with me

I don't know about that,
but check this out.

Shat.
Oh my God

Oh shit

Hush, mamacita
Oh shit, oh shit.

Can-- can I go-- in?

Yeah, go right ahead
and grab a bud to smoke

Oh Lord Jesus

You see, this is what I do

What, smoke weed?

No, I cultivate it

I know what climate it likes

what's the best
source of nourishment?

I know how it grows
I know how it thinks.

I know how it feels.
I am one with the sativa plant

And most importantly I know
when it's time to harvest.

Right, well, I'm trying to
harvest this weed into a blunt

Or a zigzag or something

Right over there in the box

Appreciate it, folk

So that's what I do. I teach
these hillbillies how to grow weed

and they pay me well for it

Why don't you just start
your own crop?

Oh, no way

This mountain is
basically controlled by two families

Two families
of inbred, backwood

animalistic hillbillies

the Gatsfields...

and the McRoys

My crop came up
a few pounds short again!

I know your sons had
something to do with it!

I got my own crop!
I ain't had nothing to do with that

Shit.
These two families have been feuding

for years-- decades

First it was moonshine
and now it's chronic.

You got me fucked up. I ain't
going up there with them crackers

See, I told you from the get-go we
should have just started rapping, man

Man, what the fuck
you talking about, man?

It was your whole stupid-ass
idea in the first place, man.

Until I seen all that camping shit.
I knew this was some fucked shit then

It's too late now,
Captain Dipshit.

All right, come on, pendejos,
stop it, all right? Listen,

I got a foolproof plan
to pull it off.

That mean you gonna roll
with us then, right?

No, I can't
Why not?

I've been banished from up there

Why is that?

It's a long story,
but I tell you what

I'm gonna send you up there
to meet somebody that I know

Her name is Marie.
She's Jim Gatsfield's only daughter

She works at the only bar up there--

The Last Call

Oh yeah

Hey, what's happening?
How you doing?

I'm fine.
Yes, you are

I'm Little Earl.
This is my player partner

Ray Ray.
I'm Marie.

Can I get y'all
something to drink?

Yeah, can we get two cognacs
and a chaser on the side?

Hold the chaser.
Coming right up

She's fine.
What brings you around these parts?

Well, Sanchez sent us
up here, you know,

to holla at you
Sanchez?

What would he send you
up here for?

To get some of them trees.

The what?
The crops, lady, the crops

How about some drinks, sweetass?

The hell you boys doing in here?

You know you ain't welcome
in Gatsfield's bar.

Me and my brother was sitting up
on the hill drinking whiskey,

when we decided tonight was the night we
was gonna get a piece of that sweet ass.

The only thing y'all gonna get
is a hole in your head.

I get it.
You're only into dark meat

Oh, I got your stuffin', baby

What about you stuff
some Febreze in your mouth?

You talk pretty bold for a nigger

Did you just call me a nigger?
What the-- whoa, shit, he's strong

But not you

Punk, you hit me?
I'm not talking about mine, huh?

Ooooh.
Fuckboy!

You gonna get yours!
You just got yours, pussy!

FuckboY!

Y'all all right?

I want to thank y'all for saving me

Here you go

What the fuck
is going on in here?

Where'd y'all get
them guns from-- T.l.?

Are you motherfuckers

trying to put your
ginormous-sized penises

into our sweet Marie?

She's a virgin, you know
No, she ain't.

How do you know?

It was the crop
Just so sweet.

You fucking maggots were
trying to touch my sister

in places that family's
only supposed to?

What?
I say we take these two pieces of shit

outside right now!
Yeah, and then dump their sorry asses

down there by the river

Sounds like a plan.
No, y'all, they helped me

The McRoy boys was here.
That's why I flipped the alarm

And these two
ran 'em up on outta here

Are you shitting me?
These two?

Yeah.
I swung first

Beat the crap outta them,
had them running outta here

like a couple of sissies
"G" shit.

Well, dip my balls
in sweet cream and squat me

in a kitchen full of kittens
You're such a poet.

Anybody that fucks
with them McRoys

are friends of ours
Absolutely!

You boys come over for dinner tonight
Aw, but, Paw,

I wanted to kill them.
I never get to kill nobody

In time, son. In due time

This barbecue's banging, man

What kind of meat is this?
Raccoon.

Told ya

Told ya not to eat it.

Say, Earl, why don't you give us
a song from back home?

No, I couldn't play like that

Y'all ain't ready for me.
Hey! My old lady wants you

to sing a song, sing a song.
And it better not be Hank Williams

Some songs are
sacrimonius around here

Spell sacrimonius
N-l-G-G--

All right, all right, all right

All right

Yeah, pluck them
goddamn strings on that guitar

Let me show you how to get down

Oh, I got one right here
Turn me up.

I stay smoking kush,
she look like Reggie Bush

Y'all look
like some slackers

Oops, I meant some crackers--

Crackers?! You want some crackers,
go up in the house.

They're in the pantry.
Behind the moonshine

Shit, that ain't nothing.
I can do better than that

J.R., pluck them strings
you always pluck for me

June Bug, bust a beat

Yo, I chose this life,
this life chose me

I didn't choose this life,
this life chose me

I'm a hick from the sticks,
bitch, don't sneak

I puff a lot of pot,
I drink a lot of booze

Rhyme against me,
I guarantee you'll lose

Don't get me pissed,
tryin' to dis my folks

Next time you try and rap,
wrap you lips around this and choke

That's my son!
Came from my nut

I can tell

So what is it like growing up
here in these mountains?

Well

it's all right, I guess

I much rather would've grown up
somewhere like Atlanta.

Hmm, yeah
Yeah.

Tell me what it's like there

I always wanted to know what
it's like to grow up in the city.

I mean,
I grew up there all my life

It's cool I guess,
but it's funny though

When I came out here, I was
just dying to get away from the hood

From what?
The hood.

The city.
Oh, sorry

No, but like I was saying,
I was just dying to get away

But now that we're here,

I kinda miss it, you know what
I'm saying? Just the little things

The liquor stores, the people,

the food.
You didn't like raccoon?

No.
Huh-uh

So

what brought y'all
around these parts?

Sanchez sent us over here
to get some crops.

We gonna--
Oh, shh!

You trying to get yourself killed?

Say, Earl,
you want to smoke some?

Did LeBron mama get fucked?

Try that shit out

You ain't said nothing
but a word, man.

He's gonna fucking do it

The fuck you sniggling for?!

That's fucking
crystal meth, dude

You retard !

So y'all are here
to snatch some crop?

Yeah, Sanchez sent us
up here to holla at you about

snatching up some crops,
so we try and come up.

You know that'll get you
killed around these parts?

Pfft, killed?
Niggas face death every day

living in the hood

Well, you're a brave man

I'm just trying to make a credit

Make what?

Never mind.
So what's up with the crops?

Mmm, you sure that's all
you wanna talk about?

Business first, you know

Maybe a little pleasure later
Mmm.

Well, how about a little of both?

Mmm, well...
Marie!

Yeah?
Time to come in

Look, you want
to finish this later?

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Yeah, later.

Marie!

Here I come

I'll holla at you in a little bit

Where do I... sleep

Mann

Don't put that thumb in my ass

Where are they going?

Oh, they're all going on
to work on the crops.

Earl.
It's a curable disease

Oh, come on, Earl, get up.
It's a curable disease, baby

Get up!
They're going to get the crops

Who?
Let's go, man. Come on

Don't forget your lunch

Oh, you flirt.
You old flirt!

There you go

Scoot!
Don't look at my booty

How can I help it?

We got a big day ahead of us, bro
It's just weed, man.

Yeah

Yeah, let's go

Let's roll, buddy
You're strong.

Aw, no, shit.
What's up, baby? You good?

Everybody that voted
for Barack Obama?

Get outta my truck.
That means you two

We got work to do
I can't vote.

We don't mind working, though
We can work all day.

I like to earn my keep
Paw said you can't go

So I suggest you two get
the fuck outta this truck

before I skin one of you
city motherfuckers.

I do not need a haircut
All right, damn, man.

All right, all right

I know when we're not wanted

Let's roll.
Yeah, I can tell when we ain't wanted

It's a damn shame. Okay

Yeehaw

Fucking bite me!
Oh, Lord!

Why he do that?

His daddy must be
running up in here.

Man, this really sucks

We ain't got no weed,
we ain't got no money

And on top of that,
I had to see this white man's ass

that look like
an empty eye socket

I'm gone.
Man, I'm tired of this

Where-- where you going?
I gotta go boo-boo.

Now what the fuck are we gonna do?

Hey, come on

Game

The hell this fool go?

Hey! You left me

Yodelayheehoo-hoo.

Hi there, sexy

Tell me, what would you do

for some of this?

Hmm?
Unfortunately anything

Oh, that's kinda what I thought

Won't you follow Ma?
Come on now.

Don't be shy
Come on.

I wish I was shy
Whoo!

Oooh!

Hey, where are we going?
You'll see.

Mam

all timid and shy

You're just a little
cute little baby is what you are

Don't you want to smoke?
Yes, now. Can I do it right now?

Huh-uh-uh.
I need it right now

No no no.
No love, no bud

Can we get this over with?

That's just what Paw said
on our wedding night, you poet

Come on now.
Slip them panties off

I'm so stupid!

These are not panties neither

Oh really?
These are briefs!

Oh my goodness,
now you're all the man, aren't you?

Oh my! Look, I was right
You are packing.

I'm gonna have to take
my teeth out for this.

Teeth?

Ahh-- Oh

Oh-- oh my God

Oh-

This weed--

this weed right here
is the bomb, man.

Your pops grow this shit right here?
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, I got it out
of a secret stash.

Secret stash?
All the weed they growing up there,

why they don't just give you some?

Give"?

No, sugar.
They don't give me anything

Shit.
Thank you

The only time they
pay attention to me

is when the McRoy boys
are bothering me

or if they want me to sleep
in the bed with them

so they can grope
all over me and shit

Your father too?
My father, my mother, my brothers,

the uncles, cousins--
all of them, shit.

That's how family does
That's fucked up.

Pilot?
Yes.

All right, we want to make sure
we fly nice and low. Make sure we get

the faces of these bastards
Roger.

Looks pretty good

Think I'll leave it
out here another week or so

All right,
get ready, get ready

You see that sumbitch
taking pictures?

Who was it?

I don't know

So we gotta harvest this
sooner than I thought.

Now you know you was wrong
for having me in that boat today

Ah, you all right.
You know black folks

and water don't get along too good

What if I could've drown?

Oh, I guess I would have had
to give you mouth-to-mouth.

Oh shit,
you can do that anyway

Maybe we should hurry up and get back
before my dad and them get home.

Shit, let's do it
All right.

Oh yeah yeah
Mmm...

What? What's up, fellas?
Hey, what's happening?

You took a wrong fucking
turn somewhere, buddy.

Uh well, we just took
a cruise in a boat.

And we was headed
back up the hill

and we about

No, you ain't going nowhere
Hey look, y'all,

Man, okay, wait a minute, man
Damn, hold up, hold up.

girlfriend here watch

Yeah, I'll make you squeal like a pig!

Oh no, wait a minute, man
Hold up. One thing.

One thing before you do that, man,

Let me hit this one time

Fuck your face!
Fuck your face!

Fuck your face!
Fuck your mother's face!

Fuck your face,

Fuck your damn face. Fuck your
goatee and your big eyebrows

and fuck your little-ass neck!
Chill out, chill out.

Look here, you gotta pick
either me or her. Make a choice

Oh, Earl,

I just wanted to thank you

for all that plumbing work
you did for me

this morning.

You really cleaned out my pipes

I'll step in any booby trap
you want me to. Let's go.

Let's go.
I'm ready to die

Watch out

Who the fuck is this?
They only guard it like this

when it's a close call
Close call like what?

Pot snatchers or the police

So they gonna shoot it out
with the fucking police?

No, they got flamethrower things

at each corner of the crops

That's some smart-ass hillbillies
Mm-hmm.

Man, I'm glad you're
so impressed with their criminality

But now how the fuck
we supposed to get this weed?

I guess we're gonna have to
come up with another plan.

Oh shit, come on
Come on, nigga.

See, Ray and Earl
or even I didn't realize

we had picked
the worst possible time

to make a move

The DEA agents were hot
on the Gatsfield's tail

and preparing to make a bust

All right, ladies and gentlemen,

and Deputy Dick
Dan.

Whatever. We are gonna send
our ground troops

on the ground right here,
while simultaneously

choppers will be landing
here on the field.

Okay?
What day are we doing this?

Tomorrow

Now--
Tomorrow's bowling night

Can we do it Thursday?
Deputy Dan?

You're not stuck
on stupid, are you?

You're dangling on dummy
Shut the hell up.

Where the hell did you
find this guy?

Are we clear?
Any questions?

What's he mean by that?

All right, look, y'all

we gonna come out right here
Uh-huh.

Start here and we gonna come out
somewhere about right here.

And we gonna be off on the freeway
and then after that we home free.

Cool.
Okay?

Yeah yeah
Good.

That shit sound good,
but so did your other plan

that got fucked up.

Look,baby,
this here is foolproof

That's what your mouth say
I don't believe that shit.

Well, this is right
this time, I promise

I know it for a fact.
Hell, all your shit always-

Shut the hell up!

Get your girl, man. I ain't buying that
fucking shit. You know how I get.

Carry your ass
I slap bitches.

Get him.
Man, you better get your girl

before I Chris Brown her ass

Chill out, man.
Let's concentrate on the weed

Man, you concentrate on checking her,

She know what she doing.
Fuck you and motherfuck you!

You know what?
I thought about it, I'm a chill

That's cool
I'm a chill.

Cool. All right now

I take my fuck back from you,

When are we gonna do this?
Tomorrow morning.

I heard my daddy and them

We're outta here.

Shit, tomorrow morning

Yeah.
Uh-huh

Mm-hmm.

You a sucker-for-love nigga, man

What are you doing here, Marie?
It's the McRoy boys.

They got my daddy

Come on, y'all. We don't have
enough time. Come on, hurry up

What the hell are you doing?
Who's guarding the crops?

Marie's guarding the crops. She said
the McRoys are back at the house.

What?
Ain't no McRoys at the house

That little sweetass is lying
Let's get back up the hill!

Yeah, finally going
to get to kill somebody!

Center mass, Lil June,

In between the nipple
and the knee.

Hey, y'all come on

before they get back.
All right, just one more row

Ugh, God!

Oh, fuck you, Earl.

Fuck you, fuck him
Fuck her.

I couldn't leave here
without my baby.

Yes! Told y'all I could
get y'all a ride.

Come on, get in.
I'll tell you all about it

on the way out.
You're hiding a ton of things

Look here,
that's one hell of a story, man

Is it true?

100%.
Damn!

So I know they made it back
to the hood with all that sweet sativa

and flipped that shit,
now they sitting on fat

Hey, I know they got cheese, man

No, they flat broke, man
They spent it

on lowriders and hookers.
How much of this do you want?

Of this shit right here?

Man, I want all of this
motherfucking shit, nigga

Kick that in, right now

It's always a pleasure
doing business with you, baby

Shit, right on
There you go

D-E-V the D-U-D-E

Coffee for the E-X-E-C

Just as I am with dandy

Fifth Ward, Ailey Dance,
street club freaks, Spice Lane

To all the killers
who nose full of 'caine

To all the underclassmen
who rose from the fray

For those who never has-been
thinking they sired Cain

To all of those who wanna be,
really thinking they are

Even though they reach their
limit and took it too far

This for those who are
really thinking they focused

Never up the nose,
dipping cigarettes is bogus

All we need, we roll it
inhale and hold it

Exhale, 'cause hell,
all we need, we smoke it

All you need is weed
and nothing else

Sit back and roll one
and enjoy yourself

All them other narcotics
fuck up your health

Yeah yeah yeah

All you need is weed
and nothing else

Sit back and roll one
and enjoy yourself

All them other narcotics
fuck up your health

Yeah yeah yeah

I got an old school partner,
he smoke crack

He's fierce with the lyrics,
but he probably won't come back

To the studio, because he
might be out creepin'

In somebody's house, trying
to clean 'em out, thievin'

I know another nigga,
he smoke fry

He always cry,
but we don't know why

We tried to give him advice,
but he wouldn't take it

Saw him last Wednesday
walking down the street beggin

My homeboy used to holla,
but he's out there snorting powder

Hour after hour,
but he'd never take a shower

And I guess it's cool
if you can handle your thing

But it's kinda fucked up
if you dismantle your brain

Like my nigga poking his
veins with tracks in his arm

He ain't real cool,
but he's always calm

He disappear real quick
and shoot up one D

I tried to pass him the weed
the nigga asleep.

What you know about that hydro?

I'm riding to the chronic
smoking chronic

Blueberry balls

Man, it picks me up,

Please don't come around me
if you don't smoke weed

I'm smoking like a teapot

Are you scared of this shit
that we've got?

Push 'em good, nigga

No seeds

Droski

In addition I've gotta
track the police

And everybody within four feet

I'm looking like I got no sleep

But I'm cool like a bag
of ice with no cold feet

Two blunts I roll, home sweets

I see two hos, I get ball freeze

We hook up
then we smoke weed

We blow the blunts
then they blow me

Centerfold girl like
