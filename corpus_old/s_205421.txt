Cinderella flew through the air...

far from all things
ugly and ordinary..

When she landed at the ball,
she found herself...

most impertinently surrounded
by pirates.

There was AlfMason,
so ugly his mother sold him
for a bottle ofmuscat.

BillJukes,
every. inch ofhim tattooed.

And worst ofthem all,

Hook, with eyes bl ue
as forget-me-nots,

save when he clawed your belly
with the iron hook he has...

instead of a right hand,
at which time...

his eyes turn red.

"Girlie," said Hook,

"we have come
forye glass slippers."

Who beyou to order me about
and call me girlie?
Take that!

Take that! Take that!

Commoner!

The night on which
the extraordinary. adventures...

ofthese children
may be said to have begun...

was the night Nana
barked at the window.

But there was nothing there,
not a bird or a leaf.

So the children forgot
about it,

for what troubles a grown-up
will never trouble a child.

There never was
a happier, simpler family.

Mr. Darling was a banker
who knew the cost ofeverything,
even a hug.

Mrs. Darling was the loveliest
lady in Bloomsbury....

with a sweet, mocking mouth
that had one kiss on it...

that Wendy could never get.

Though there it was,

perfectly conspicuous
on the right-hand corner.

And sometimes there
was Aunt Millicent...

who felt a dog for a nurse

ofthe neighborhood.

are educated nowadays.

[ Chuckles ]
I'm afraid I am not
learned at all, Aunt.

But I do know a thing or two
about pirates.
Ooh.

My unfulfilled ambition is
to write a great novel in three
parts about my adventures.

What adventures?
I'veyet to have them,

but theywill be
perfectly thrilling.

But, child, novelists
are not highly thought of
in good society.

And there is nothing
so difficult to marry as a novelist.

Marry?

But, Aunt, Wendy is notyet 1 3.

Shh.

Mm, yes.

Oh, it's Quite as I expected.

Wendy possesses a woman's chin.

Haveyou not noticed?
Observe her mouth.

There, hidden
in the right-hand corner,

is that a kiss?

[Mrs. Darling Gasps ]

A kiss?
Like Mother's kiss.

[Millicent ]
A hidden kiss.
But what is it for?

It is for the greatest
adventure of all.

They that find it...

have slipped in and out ofheaven.

Find what?

The one the kiss belongs to.

Yes, Mother,
you don't have to go.

Please, Mother.

By himself?

Your father is a brave man.

But he's going to need
the special kiss to face
his colleagues tonight.

Father? Brave?

There are many
different kinds ofbravery.

There's the bravery ofthinking
of others before oneself.

Now, your father has never
brandished a sword nor fired
a pistol, thank heavens.

But he's made many sacrifices
for his family...

and put away many dreams.

Where did he put them?

He put them in a drawer.

And sometimes, late at night,
we take them out and admire them.

But it gets harderandharder
to close the drawer.

He does.

And that is why he is brave.

And remember, every cloud
