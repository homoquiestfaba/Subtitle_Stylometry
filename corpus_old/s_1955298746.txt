MAN:
E, E, E, E, E.

Then I would go to, like, a G.

And these are all
just power chords.

Hey, how you doin'?
You're tuned in

to Style Boyz Television.

I'm just sparking up.
Style Boyz Radio!

Sparking up this French fry.
Ah! Well, KFFFR.

I am French fry guy.

Hello.
No! French fry guy!

I am French fry guy.
Not again!

Yeah! About to be!
Style Boyz.

â™ª Me likey that â™ª
â™ª When a genie grants wishes â™ª

â™ª About girls blowing kisses
and your mama doin' dishes â™ª

â™ª Me likey that. â™ª

MAN:
Okay, where to start.

Ever since I was born,
I was dope.

WOMAN:
Honey!

Oh, my gosh, sweetie!

CONNER:
I loved music.

And as soon as I could,

I started a band
with my two best friends,

Owen and Lawrence.

The Style Boyz.

Right away, people noticed us

because our lyrics
were beautiful

and insightful, poetic even.

â™ª You're a motherfuckin',
titty-suckin', two-ball bitch â™ª

â™ª With a popcorn pussy
and a full-on dick â™ª

â™ª Style Boyz in the house
and we give a fuck â™ª

â™ª So whip out your nuts
and shut the fuck up! â™ª

QUESTLOVE:
The thing about the Style Boyz

is that their chemistry
and their friendship

was really authentic.

You know, you could tell

that they were really friends
with each other.

They were hot. (chuckles)

CONNER:
Before you knew it,

we signed with a major label

and put out our first single,

"Karate Guy."

â™ª One, two, three, four â™ª

â™ª I like to kick it â™ª

â™ª I'm a karate guy â™ª

â™ª Kia, kia â™ª

â™ª Kia... â™ª

"Karate Guy."

You kidding me, man?

That song changed my life.

â™ª Now I'm in a cowboy hat â™ª

â™ª Yeehaw, yeehaw â™ª

â™ª Now I'm in a cowboy hat â™ª

â™ª Yeehaw, yeehaw â™ª

â™ª Now I'm in
three cowboy hats â™ª

â™ª Yeehaw. â™ª

USHER: Kid Contact, he handled
the beats and the music.

Kid Brain, you know,
he did all the lyrics.

And then Conner,
he was the charismatic one,

the one who
brought it all together.

You-you tell me
you didn't see him and say,

"Yo, he's the star."

CONNER: Things definitely
started to get complicated.

I couldn't help it
if the world chose me.

MAN: Take one.
You want me to look here?

Pretty funny, right? (laughs)

Be original,

be fearless.

I love my White Butt Jeans.

As my star kept burning
brighter, some stood by me.

Others couldn't take the heat.

CONNER:
We broke up the next day.

I went solo,
and Owen became my DJ.

Lawrence quit
the music biz altogether.

And our DJ Francis moved
to Japan to hunt dolphins,

like a dickhead.

But it turned out all of that

was just a blessing
in disguise,

because it turned me
into Conner4Real.

I dropped my first album,
and what can I say?

It was a smash.

And I owed it all to my fans,

who I share everything with.

Yo, brushing my teeth.

Yo, I just ate a taco.

It's Conner's Confessions:
Hoverboard Edition.


(grunts, whimpers)
Dude.

Yo, just got my butt waxed.

That shit hurt!

He's painfully honest
with his fans,

probably too honest, really.

Like, but they love him for it.

Yo.

Just jacked it.

Um, feeling pretty mellow
right now.

Doinkdedoink.
Doinkdedoink!

Doinkdedoink!

Doinkdedoink!
Doinkdedoink!

I think he's incredible.

He really is the real deal.

CONNER:
My fans and me,

we're in love.

My songs are love letters.

And the arena is our bedroom.

The stage...

The stage is where we fuck.

(crowd cheering)
â™ª Yep-yep-yep-yep, work-work-work-work â™ª

â™ª Mm-mm-mm-mm,
oh-oh-oh-oh â™ª

â™ª Yep-yep-yep-yep,
work-work-work-work â™ª

â™ª Watch out, watch out â™ª

It's Conner!

â™ª Bar none, I am â™ª

â™ª The most humblest â™ª

â™ª Number one at the top
of the humble list â™ª

â™ª My apple crumble is by far
the most crumblest â™ª

â™ª But I act like it tastes bad
out of humbleness â™ª

â™ª The thing about me
that's so impressive â™ª

â™ª Is how infrequently I mention
all of my successes â™ª

â™ª I pooh-pooh it when girls say
that I should model â™ª

â™ª My belly's full from
all the pride I swallow â™ª

(engine revs)

â™ª I've got it all,
and I'm getting more â™ª

Adam Levine's hologram!
â™ª But I never fall â™ª

â™ª Beat 'em all â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you know
I'm so humble â™ª

So expensive!

â™ª I'm so humble â™ª
I'm so...

â™ª I'm so humble â™ª
I'm so humble.

â™ª I'm not
your normal definition â™ª

â™ª Of a rock star â™ª

â™ª I don't complain
when my private jet is subpar â™ª

â™ª Your mom's old, but I'll ask
if she's your sister â™ª

â™ª People say I'm charming â™ª

â™ª But-but I beg to differ â™ª

â™ª I feel more humble than
Dikembe Mutombo â™ª

â™ª After a stumble â™ª

â™ª Left him covered
in a big pot of gumbo â™ª

â™ª I guess, in a way,
being great â™ª

â™ª Just is my weakness â™ª

â™ª People say
I'm so unpretentious â™ª

â™ª For a genius â™ª

â™ª I've got it all,
and I'm getting more â™ª

â™ª But I never fall,
beat 'em all â™ª

â™ª 'Cause you know
I'm so humble â™ª

CONNER:
I say that with no ego!

â™ª I'm so humble... â™ª

â™ª I'm so humble â™ª

â™ª Yep-yep-yep-yep,
work-work-work-work â™ª

â™ª Mm-mm-mm-mm,
oh-oh-oh-oh â™ª

â™ª Yep-yep-yep-yep,
work-work-work-work â™ª

â™ª Watch out, watch out. â™ª

"I'm So Humble," I instantly
connected with that,

because I'm probably the most
humble person that I know.

MAN: Yeah, well, it's a pretty
exciting time right now.

Conner's second album, his
second solo album, CONNquest,

is dropping in two weeks.

And then we go
on the world tour.

Harry, get in here, man.
I've been Conner's manager

since back with
the Style Boyz.

It used to be the four of us
riding around in a van,

but, uh, with success,

our family had to get
a little bit bigger.

Sure, Conner surrounds himself
with people who are agreeable.

I wouldn't call them yes men.

Money!
(cheering)


Did it go in?
Swish!

Oh, it went in, it went in!

You a murderer, son!

Well, Conner currently
has 32 people

on his personal payroll.

He has a personal assistant,
a party coordinator,

an ab trainer,
basketball coach,

an eyebrow specialist,
sneaker jockey,

two umbrella wranglers,
a weed roller,

a weed holder,
(sirens wailing)

a turtle sitter for Maximus,
scarf caddy,

a guy who punches him in the nuts
(groans)

so that he remembers where he came from...
You're right.

...a perspective manipulator...

Oh, that's a guy who's, uh,
slightly shorter than Conner

who he pays
to stand near him at events

to make him look taller.

You know,
back in my high school days,

I was in a band.

You may heard of them...
called Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! TonEe?

We broke up
over creative differences.

Each Tony had an exclamation
point after their name,

and I thought my name
should have a question mark.

So it would be
Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! TonEe?

In hindsight,
it was not my best decision.

But that led me to Conner.

So who's laughing now?

CONNER:
There you go, buddy.

Ow, dude.

You bit me, Max.

This is my best friend Maximus.

My mom gave him to me
when I was nine years old.

Like, right after my dad died.

I feel like he's, like,
the closest thing

I've ever had to, like,
a little brother or something.

If I had, like, a mute brother
that was hella scaly.

As a hatchling,
the doctors said

that he had been diagnosed
with soggy bones syndrome,

and that he was not gonna
make it past, like, six months.

But that was 20 years ago.

You're my best friend.

Don't tell Owen.

Come on up here. This is
Owen's world right here.

This is where I keep
all my gear.

This is one of the earliest,
uh, synths I ever got.

It's a DX7. This is a classic.

Oh, in Conner's show? No, no.

In Conner's show,
I just use this.

Uh, it's a iPod.

60 gigs, so, you know,
I can fit the entire show,

and, uh, plus, like,
a bunch of dope audio books.

You know?

NARRATOR (over speakers):
It was year three at Hogwarts,

and Harry was worried
it would never get any easier.

Harry P.

You know, a lot of people
ask me that.

They say, like, "Is it weird

"for you to be playing
the background now?

'Cause, you know,
you used to be in Style Boyz."

And I always say,
"No, man, not at all, man,

'cause I-I could never do
what Conner does, you know?"

CONNER:
Look, I'm a perfectionist.

My first album sold
four million copies.

So this one has to sell more.

And that's why I take this
so seriously, you know?

And I-I live for this music.

And... (sighs)

It can't go away.

That's why I personally wrote
every song on this record,

and I used over 100 producers
for just 17 tracks

to guarantee
that they're all hits.

I made a lot of the beats
on the first record,

but on this one, Conner said
he really wanted to branch out.

It's good for him to grow,
you know?

And, also, I played him
a bunch of my beats,

and he was like, "No."

CONNER:
What's up, y'all?

Got a hot new single coming.

And it addresses
some social issues

that I think are being ignored.

So keep your eyes peeled
for that.

We're gonna be
surprise releasing it

next Thursday at noon.

Uh, and that's it.

â™ª â™ª

Discrimination.

It ain't right.

â™ª I'm not gay, but if I was â™ª

â™ª I would want equal rights â™ª

â™ª I'm not gay, but if I were â™ª

â™ª I would marry who I like â™ª

â™ª It's not fair, I'm not gay â™ª

â™ª That the government
has a say â™ª

â™ª In who can love who,
not gay â™ª

â™ª Or to which god you can pray,
I'm not gay â™ª

â™ª It gets me so angry â™ª

â™ª On behalf of them,
I feel passionate â™ª

â™ª Not gay, so I pray for them â™ª

â™ª And I say for them,
we need to make a change â™ª

â™ª Not gay,
I see it clear as day â™ª

â™ª This area is not gray,
titties â™ª

â™ª We need equality
and for all to see â™ª

â™ª That this is the new way,
not gay â™ª

â™ª Just seems, not gay,
wrong, not gay â™ª

â™ª That no one seems
to care, sports â™ª

â™ª We can't continue
to pretend â™ª

â™ª This, not gay, madness has to end, not gay â™ª
â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª I was born this way â™ª
â™ª Straight â™ª

â™ª You were born your way â™ª
â™ª Gay â™ª

â™ª Gay or straight,
straight or gay â™ª

â™ª It's all okay â™ª
â™ª Sure â™ª

â™ª It's time to make a change â™ª
â™ª Yes â™ª

â™ª Time to stop the hate â™ª
â™ª Uh â™ª

â™ª 'Cause who you are is beautiful â™ª
â™ª Not gay â™ª

â™ª Not gay, lyin' in bed â™ª

â™ª Next to ten beautiful girls,
all straight â™ª

â™ª And while I made love
to every one of them â™ª

â™ª I was thinking
about the world, hot wings â™ª

â™ª True love trumps all,
Predator â™ª

â™ª Flying kicks, not gay,
big watch, not gay â™ª

â™ª Missionary, "One Love,"
gym socks, nunchucking â™ª

â™ª Not gay, lighter fluid, HD,
ninja, world peace â™ª

â™ª Four-wheel drive,
gay marriage, love beav â™ª

â™ª Free love, golf club,
two guys, not gay â™ª

â™ª Rainbow, muff dive,
Harvey Milk, Sean Penn â™ª

â™ª Not gay, drum solo,
courtside seats, safe sex â™ª

â™ª One-arm pushups,
Lynyrd Skynyrd â™ª

â™ª I'm not gay, I'm not gay â™ª

â™ª I'm not, not, n-not,
n-not gay, I'm not gay â™ª

â™ª I was born this way â™ª
â™ª I'm straight â™ª

â™ª You were born your way â™ª
â™ª You're gay â™ª

â™ª Gay or straight,
straight or gay â™ª

â™ª It's all okay â™ª
â™ª And now it's time â™ª

â™ª For sexual freedom for all â™ª
â™ª It's time to make a change â™ª

â™ª Sexual freedom for all â™ª
â™ª Time to stop the hate â™ª

â™ª Sexual freedom for all... â™ª
â™ª 'Cause you are â™ª

â™ª Sexual freedom for all â™ª
â™ª Is beautiful â™ª

â™ª Not gay. â™ª

RINGO:
He's writing this song

for gay marriage.

You know,
like it's not allowed.

It's allowed now.

CONNER:
Usually, I don't like

to read reviews, but...

I'm just excited.

Like, I can't, I can't wait.

I want to know
how people feel about it,

and I want to know
how much they love it, so...

uh, here we go.


Um...

Well, it's Pitchfork, it's...

They gave it a negative review.

No, like, it's a negative four

out of ten...
positive ten, I assume.

Pitchfork can be kind of
pretentious though, so...

But ooh. What?

You ain't gonna knock
my hustle.

Let's look at another one.

Let's pull it up.
Rolling Stone.

Okay.

Um, out of four possible stars,

Rolling Stone has given it...

the shit emoji.

I can only assume it's a, um,
a mess-up, you know?

They must've had a-a problem
with their, um...

No, this seems like
the right score

for how they're saying this.

You know what,
let's just do a search.

(typing)
CONNquest review.

Oh, here we go.

Here we go.

"CONNquest: a triumph."

That's a good one.

Let me read this.

This is on...

The Onion.

So, you know, mixed.

Let's call it mixed reviews.

BIG BOY:
So first you're in a group.

You introduced us
to the Style Boyz.

And "Donkey Roll," of course,
we play the hell out of that.

That's a hit for us, man,

and then, Conner,
you get that breakout moment.

You get a phone call
from Claudia Cantrell.

The one and only.

And she asks you
for a verse, man,

on her song,
"Turn Up the Beef."

â™ª Turn up the beef â™ª

â™ª Throw your body
on the flame... â™ª

But you take that moment,
and instead of just, like,

kicking a regular verse...
you know what I'm saying...

you did something
a little different.

The "catchphrase verse,"
as it's now known.

Uh-oh, yeah, yeah. Hello.

Um, I had been working
on a catchphrase,

but what had happened was

I just thought
of so many dope ones

that I was like,
"What if I put them

all into the verse?"

â™ª Turn up the beef â™ª

â™ª It's Conner bitch, say word â™ª

â™ª D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dilbert â™ª

â™ª Doinkdedoink, sorry, Dad â™ª

â™ª Dinkynuts, squirrel jam,
hats... â™ª

Yeah, he said so many words
I didn't know.

That was
a game-changing moment.

50 CENT: There's usually, like,
one catchphrase in a hit.

He dropped, like, 30 on us
in one night. Shit was crazy.

â™ª D.J. Tanner, swanky pumps â™ª

â™ª M-M-Moped music, Costco
samples like a mothafucka â™ª

â™ª Uuuunngh, crank up the mids â™ª

â™ª Patrick Stewart money â™ª

â™ª You know who it is,
Conner4Real. â™ª

Immediately, I said,
man, this guy right here,

he's gonna make it big.

Because when you have
a catchphrase,

the world is catched
by your phrase.

BIG BOY: You fast-forward.
Things start to happen, man.

You get
the-the Pop Music Award.

And now, here comes those
offers of a solo contract.

CONNER:
Yeah.

How did the other Style Boyz
feel about that?

You know, they took it fine.
Mm-hmm.

Owen is my DJ
and my best friend.

That's good, man.
And Lawrence

lives on a farm now, so...
Hold on.

Lawrence Dunn is a farmer?

(bird squawking)

LAWRENCE:
My name is Lawrence Dunn.

I used to be in the Style Boyz.

Now I'm a farmer.

Being out here in nature,

away from all the people

and the trappings of
modern life, it's so peaceful.

There's nothing like it.
(groans in pain)

I've never been happier.
(bird screeches)

Uh, so yeah, this is, uh,

all my woodwork.

It's kind of my passion,
uh, my hobby.

This is a nice piece.

It's called
"Government in Crisis."

For obvious reasons.

This one's a mask.

Still me.

It's a hat.

You know,
we were going places as a band.

We had plans as a band.

Style Boyz, that's three guys,

not two...
it doesn't work with two.

You know?
It's like a tricycle.

You take away one of
the wheels, what do you got?

Nothin'. A bicycle.

Don't use that.

Look, we had a good run,
you know?

We had a few hits.

But it had run its course,
you know?

It was time for us

to all move on.

Get over it.

When the Style Boyz broke up...

Damn.

The only other time
I remember being that sad...

was when they killed
Josh Charles on The Good Wife.

â™ª I'm a Style Boy â™ª

â™ª For life... â™ª

(crowd cheering)

WOMAN:
Y'all ready for this?

Yeah.
Okay.

("I'm So Humble" playing)

Welcome to the future, bitches!

That's Conner's song.

Whoa.
(song stops)

(song resumes)

ALL:
Ah!

CONNER (recorded):
â™ª I'm not gay... â™ª

Oh!
Okay, both sides. Okay.

It's fun, right?!
Yeah!
(song resumes)

(whooping)
You know, this is my favorite.

I like the freezer one.

Listen to this, homies.

We can upload your entire album

to fridges, washer-dryers,

blenders and microwaves
across the country.

You could do that?

Yes, nerd.

It's just Wi-Fi jibber-jabber.

It's not a big deal.

Nobody doing appliance shit, my nigga.
No.

Is that right, my nigger?
No one is doing appliance shit.

Yeah.
HARRY: Okay. Went with the hard "R."

This is that
next, next, next, man.

I told y'all, Deborah's a genius!
Mm.

It's true. And it is
also pronounced De-bor-ah.

De-bor-ah.
Oh, that's very cool.

It's exotic.
What's the origin of that?

Uh, I believe "Deborah."

That was ridiculous!
Right?

Oh, my God, yes,
that was insane.

I mean, who would want
to listen to music that way?

(singsongy): Schwag!
I know it's kind of weird,

but Aquaspin's gonna help us
get the music out there, man.

I mean, so... you don't think
people are gonna have a problem

when music just appears
in their houses?

CONNER: Look, I know
it sounds lame, but...

there's no such thing
as selling out anymore, man.

This is how big business works.

I mean, nowadays
if you don't sell out,

people will wonder
if nobody asked you to.

Right.
But look, dude,

if you're not comfortable
with it,

we could rethink it.

No, man, that's cool,
that's cool.

All right, cool.

Let's get in the car.

This jacket's making me
sweat my ass off.

Yeah, it's fuckin' hot as shit
out here.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Welcome to the car, Conner.

CONNER: A.C.!
Did you say "Macy's"?

A.C.
Did you say "Macy's"?

Air condition.
Macy's? Macy's?

Sometimes Conner
just gets an idea

and he runs with it, you know?

And he's right,
like, 99.9% of the time, so...

you just got to trust
that he knows what he's doing.

So I understand why he,
you know,

did the whole Aquaspin thing.

Touring is expensive today.

Why you think I do
the a$ap Crunchables?

â™ª â™ª

This is Gary Sikes.
This is the label photographer.

Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
All right, there we go.

Yeah. All right.
Got the two of you. Great.

Okay, could I have
a little separation, please?

Oh, wait, hang on, Gary.
You're not trying to break up

the Dream Team, are you?
No, no, no, no.

Just trying to get the logo.
May I... may I touch you?

Yeah.
Just slide down just a little bit.

Scoot you down like that.
Little pressure. There we go.

I still see your shadow
a little bit on him.

If you don't mind,
could you just...

Still in it,
you're still in it.

Conner, nice.
Yeah, same thing.

GARY:
Nice! Yeah!

â™ª Roots and culture â™ª

(laughter)
â™ª Seeped from his bones... â™ª

Here you go, Paula.
Thank you.

Hey, how's the, uh,
Pop Music Award thing coming?

Good. I've called producers.
I'm waiting to hear back.

Please stay on them,
because you know

how important it is to him.

PAULA: I'd love
to get Conner to the point

where people forget
that he's a musician,

where he's just
kind of everywhere,

like oxygen or gravity
or clinical depression.

He's just... everywhere.

WOMAN: Conner! (laughs)
Hey.

Oh!

â™ª Extra. â™ª

Ashley Wednesday,
star of the blockbuster

Cube Theorem franchise,

was spotted with pop rapper
Conner4Real

leaving the exclusive
New York City nightclub [bleep]

last night.

Okay, let's go, kids.

Huh?
Time to go home in your fun car.

CONNER:
Ash and I have been

hanging out
for about six months now,

and I got to say,
she's the total package.

(Ashley laughs)

Well, when I was little,
I would spend hours

looking at famous couples
in magazines...

Us Weekly, People...
and everybody's speculating,

are they a real couple
or are they just for publicity?

And I knew that when I grew up,

I wanted to be
one of those couples.

ALL:
Five, four,

three, two, one!

("I'm So Humble" playing)
(crowd cheering)

(electricity hums, music stops)

(crowd groaning)

NEWSMAN: Last night,
pop star Conner4Real's

new album CONNquest
was released...

NEWSWOMAN:
...on all Aquaspin appliances.

NEWSMAN 2: Millions of
unsuspecting Americans

turned on their toasters...
You can't do that to people!

Yo, Conner4Real,
you suck, dude!


NEWSMAN: ...the president
calling the pop star

"a real dumb [bleep]."

YOUNG MAN: The only reason
he put it in appliances

is 'cause no one

was gonna buy his shit album.

ANNOUNCER:
Today on CMZ...

He released his record
with a dishwashing company?

They did this big launch,
and it was all wireless

or something, I don't know,

but it came out of
every appliance in my house,

and I was just like,
"I hate Conner4Real."

For real.


But seriously,
let's be nice to Conner4Real,

'cause he seems like
a good guy.

Uh, I don't think so.

(laughter)
Uh, I don't think so.

Uh, I don't think so.

(hysterical laughter)


(growling loudly)

(vibrating grunts)


Well, the overnight numbers

were not what
we were expecting.

They were pretty low.

But it's still early.

Yeah, some people were saying
that the Aquaspin thing

was an invasion of privacy,

so it's just a little bump
in the road.

Um... he's dealing with it.

Conner, you okay, buddy?

Maybe the numbers
were wrong, you know?

Like...

BonkoHub had a computer virus
or something.

You know, you could be right.

I'll have Jay look into it.

So what are we talking,
like, 150, 200 or...?

Mm... 65,000.

Well, that is not
where we wanted to be, but...

not bad for the day.

Actually, Conner,
that's for the week.

Estimated.

Sixty-five?

For the week?

Can you... can you...?

Hey, can you guys
give us a second here?

(bees buzzing)

(bees swarming)

(objects clattering)

(bees buzzing loudly)

(flame whooshing)

(loud, deep buzzing)

(deep roaring)

â™ª â™ª

It's the first day
of tour, baby!

(whooping)
MAN: Now, I know

Conner's bummin' right now,
but his concert is amazing.

When this thing goes off
and he's out there,

I mean, it's just a spectacle.
It's enormous.

Yeah, my name is, uh, Zippy.

I'm the guitar tech
on the tour.

Shit!

Shit.

I make sure all
the instruments are tip-top.

I love the road, you know.

This is kind of
a perfect job for me,

but my favorite free-time thing
is flatlining.

Heart rate dropping.
(monitor beeping)

ZIPPY:
Flatlining is when you, uh,

technically
lower your heart rate

until, um... well, you're dead.

MAN: He's still dropping.
Then you can catch a glimpse

of the afterlife.

Got the idea
from the film Flatliners.

Joel Schumacher film
shot by Jan de Bont.

You know, I try to fit in
a F-line sesh

at least once a week.

...two, one, hit him!
(monitor flatlining)

Clear!
(electrical thump)

Oh, wow.

Did I shit my pants?

Not this time.

To Conner!

ALL:
To Conner!

(cheering, whooping)

CONNER:
My mom means well.

She had her own dreams
of becoming a star

back in the day,

and she gave it up to have me,

so I really owe her for that.

And I'm lucky
to have her support.

I'll go first.
Okay, you go first.

(inhales sharply)
Kids first, and then moms.

Oh, my God, that is so fun!

MAN:
Hello.

My name is Tyrus Quash,
and I do

the food service
on Conner's tours.

So, these are carrots,
eight different ways.

You have your triangles,
shave, obelisks, natural,

julienne, as the French
like to call it.

Julienne.
I think that's how they say it.

Conner's very specific
when it comes to food,

and it brings me great joy

to see him love
the treats that I prepare.

(crowd cheering)
WOMAN: Yeah, Conner!

Yeah!
Let's go!
(whooping)

(crowd cheering)
(guitar playing gentle intro)

(pop beat begins)

â™ª Finest girl I ever met
in my whole life â™ª

â™ª Wanna take her home,
make her my wife â™ª

â™ª Knew she was a freak
when she started talkin' â™ª

â™ª She said, "Fuck me
like we fucked bin Laden" â™ª

â™ª Ooh, whoa,
that girl was a freak â™ª

â™ª She said she wanted me
to fuck her harder â™ª

â™ª Than the military
fucked bin Laden â™ª

â™ª Hey â™ª

â™ª Fucked bin Laden â™ª
â™ª Hey â™ª

â™ª Fucked bin Laden â™ª

â™ª She wanted to fuck me â™ª

â™ª Harder than
the U.S. Government â™ª

â™ª Fucked bin Laden â™ª

â™ª Uh, she was
a freaky kind of girl â™ª

â™ª Kept up on current events
from all around the world â™ª

â™ª More specifically,
one event â™ª

â™ª The time Osama bin Laden got
shot in the head, she said â™ª

â™ª "Do me like that," but
I couldn't track the metaphor â™ª

â™ª That said, I can see
you horny like a stegosaur â™ª

â™ª That said, again,
your request â™ª

â™ª Is so irregu-laur,
she put on a beard â™ª

â™ª I started looking
at the exit door â™ª

â™ª Then a turban,
then a tunic, she said â™ª

â™ª "Invade my cave with
your special unit," I said â™ª

â™ª "He wasn't in a cave,"
but there was no stoppin' â™ª

â™ª She demanded that I fuck her
like we â™ª

â™ª Fucked bin Laden â™ª

â™ª Hey â™ª
â™ª Fucked bin Laden â™ª

â™ª Hey â™ª

â™ª Fucked bin Laden â™ª
â™ª Hey â™ª

â™ª She wanted to fuck me â™ª

â™ª Harder than
the U.S. Government â™ª

â™ª Fucked bin Laden â™ª

â™ª This girl
requested intercourse â™ª

â™ª To bring her to climax â™ª

â™ª With the clinical
efficiency â™ª

â™ª Of the assassination
of bin Laden â™ª

â™ª You're harboring a fugitive...
that ass â™ª

â™ª And my justice
will be punitive â™ª

â™ª I'm-a smash â™ª
â™ª Night vision â™ª

â™ª They could see us
through my GoPro â™ª

â™ª She tried to negotiate,
I say that's a no-no â™ª

â™ª Now I'm creepin'
in her bedroom like go-go â™ª

â™ª She tells me to go low, then
looks down and says I gotta â™ª

â™ª Terrorize that pussy â™ª

â™ª Gotta terrorize that pussy â™ª

(over headphones):
â™ª So I did it â™ª

â™ª Improvised
some crazy shit... â™ª

â™ª SEAL Team 69... â™ª
It's fuckin' awful.

Conner's music may not be what
I listen to in my free time,

but it seems to make
so many people money.

â™ª Mona Lisa â™ª

â™ª You're an overrated
piece of shit â™ª

â™ª Can someone explain
why the whole wide world â™ª

â™ª Is obsessed with
a Garbage Pail Kid? â™ª

â™ª Looks like
a Garbage Pail Kid! â™ª

Y'all have been so amazing.

Thank you so much.
What a beautiful night.

Everybody in the front
make some noise!

(crowd cheering)

Now everybody on the sides
make some noise!

(crowd cheering)

Now everybody
way up in the upper deck

make some noise!

MAN:
Whoo!

Conner, I love you! I love you!

Whoo!

CONNER:
Harry! What the hell?!

First of all,
this is an 18,000-seat arena.

Nobody sells this out.

You sold 15,000 seats.
That's still really good.

No, it's not good.

Hammerleg sold this place out
last week!

Well, Aquaspin agrees with you.

They're concerned
about ticket sales.

What? But it's
an 18,000-seat place.

Nobody sells that out.

Hammerleg did. Last week.

Look, the low record sales
are making them nervous.

They want to bring on
an opening act.

What? We have an opening act.
Owen deejays.

Hey, I'm always saying
Style Boyz could be the opener.

No, man.
Will you stop with that?

Dude, people keep
blowing up my Twitter

about us doing "Donkey Roll."

Oh, they're blowing up your Twitter?
Yeah.

How many followers
do you have, Owen?

Like, 500,000.
Okay, well, I got 20 million,

and no one's asking me
to do that shit, so...

(laughter)
Hey-oh!

Some of those
are probably bots.

Okay, look, guys, regardless,

we still have to decide
on an opening act.

Man. (sighs)

All right, fine.

Does anybody have ideas?

One, but you are gonna like it.

Wait, did you say "are"
or "aren't"?

Are.

(dramatic hip-hop music
playing)

HUNTER:
Yeah! (chuckles)

You know the motherfucking
piece of shit.

Say, "Fuck you, Hunter!"

CROWD:
Fuck you, Hunter!

Say, "Fuck you, Hunter!"
Fuck you, Hunter!

Let's go!
â™ª Stomping through the forest â™ª

â™ª Like a retarded
tyrannosaurus â™ª

â™ª Hunter eatin' beefcakes â™ª

â™ª In the back of a Ford Taurus,
fuck a chorus â™ª

â™ª Fuck my moms, fuck your dad,
fuck this song... â™ª

Hunter the Hungry,
he's just one of those rappers

where he just doesn't
give a fuck.

RZA: People think
that he ain't crazy.

Nah, he crazy for real.
I seen him backstage.

He wasn't smoking a blunt,
he was just eating it.

QUESTLOVE:
I mean, Hunter is the youth.

You know,
he's-he's what's next.

â™ª Hey, hey,
I'm fucking hungry! â™ª

(song ends, crowd cheering)

Yo!

What up?
Conner4Real?

In the flesh? Hey, yo.

It's-it's a honor
to meet you, man.

Yo, CONNquest, Style Boyz.

I grew up off that shit, fam.

Thanks, man.
I want to be you, Conner.

But not white.
Like, black still.

'Cause it's strong...
it's a strong color.

For sure, yeah.
Like, you are that dude.

Like, have you met you?

Have you met you?

You! Have you met you?!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

This is crazy.
You be you.

Know I'm-a be all that,

'cause I'll tear some shit up.
You know how it is!

(laughter)
That is real.

(shouting, laughter)

Hell yeah!

We gonna turn up for sure.

Oh, don't hurt me!

(Hunter barking)
(laughter)

You know how it is!
Okay.

Seriously, man,
I'm-I'm real honored, dawg.

Um, I'm not gonna let you down.

You're my idol.

Right next to Jesus.
(scoffs)

And Morgan Freeman.

Uh-huh. Yeah.
I'll hit you up.

HUNTER (to crowd):
Yeah, bitch, what up!

I like him.

Where'd you get the cayenne?

Get off my basil!
Nah, dawg. That's my basil, too, B!

Get off my basil, dude!
That's my basil!

That's my basil, too!

Come on, dude.
And chives, son.

And chives.
Watch me kill this deer

real quick.
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

What? You can do that?
It's deer meat, son.

It's deer meat, bitch.
OWEN: Yo, dude.

What is this crazy shit?

Oh, dude, that's your new head!
(laughs)

What?

CONNER: I had it
specially made for you, man.

I took the measurements
while you were sleeping.

It's, like, on some futuristic
EDM shit.

We did the research,
and EDM is hot.

Robots on ecstasy and shit.

Daft Punk, deadmau5,

DJ Tommy Pizza, Oprah Spinfrey,
Vinyl Richie,

R2-LSD2,

Ecstasy-3PO, LSD-3PO,

Elton John.

All those dudes are crushing.

Look at all these functions.
Yeah.

It's like a Lite-Brite,
but it's moving.

Oh, and check this out.

OWEN:
Oh, wow.

It goes all the way up there.
All the way, man.

It's like a beacon to space.

(electronic bell chimes)

And, plus, it makes this sound.

(electronic tone blaring)

Wow!

Why would it make that sound?

I don't even know,
but it's nice to know

that it's there if you need it.

You know?
Yeah.

Yo, helmet's dope.

Looks like the tip
of Optimus Prime's dick.

CONNER:
See?

Don't you want to look
like Optimus Prime?

His dick?

Fuck yeah!
Fuck yeah!

Yeah, man. (chuckles)
I don't know.

Owen.

Please?

Please, please,
wear the helmet, Owen.

Come on, man.
The show really needs it.

Please, man?

I mean, if it'll help the tour.
Yes!

Yeah.
Dude, we're killing this!

(electronic tone blaring)

â™ª Well, howdy, ma'am â™ª

â™ª We the two banditos... â™ª

HARRY: Having Hunter aboard
has really energized the tour.

Tickets are selling.

(crowd cheering)
â™ª Gonna turn that frown... â™ª

CONNER:
Hunter is the shit.

Oh, I love you, too, man.

Oh, no, dude.

No, get off me, dude!

Get off me, dude!
Get off me!

â™ª Yeah, you know
we're two banditos â™ª

â™ª Yeah,
you know we're two banditos â™ª

â™ª Yeah, you know
we're two banditos â™ª

â™ª Do a little dance
and drink a little water... â™ª

Putting that helmet

on Owen's head...
that was a brilliant gimmick.

And I wish I'd done that
with Zayn.

We could've kept him
in One Direction for years.

Get pranked! Oh!

Pranks is where it's at.
You know what I'm saying?

Like, you got to have fun
on tour, yo.


CONNER:
Rise and shine, dude!

MAN:
You know, he's got

that sense of humor,
where it's like,

stop now, please stop.

Please stop.
Please stop doing this.

But he keeps on going.

Get your ass in!
Oh, shit!


â™ª We're two cute
little kittens, yeah â™ª

â™ª We're two
cute little kittens â™ª

â™ª Yeah, we're two cute
little kittens â™ª

â™ª Shut the fuck up! â™ª

Conner, did you take a shit
in the Anne Frank House?

Do not go in there!

(camera shutter clicking)
(whooping)


â™ª I fucked your first cousin
with a didgeridoo â™ª

â™ª And when she came,
you know it sounded like â™ª

â™ª Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! â™ª

(explosion, horn blowing)

CONNER:
This my new best friend

right here!

This my nigga!

Yeah, that's my friend!


All right,
listen up, everybody.

First of all,
I want to say congratulations

on a great show tonight!

Yeah, yeah!

HARRY:
And for the last eight shows,

we have been sold out!

(cheering)
Yeah!

It's like I was... I feel like
it's finally just clicking.

Yeah.
Hey!

We are on a roll, baby.
Yeah!

Yeah.
Is it helping album sales?

It's got to be, right?
You know how it is, you know.

Sometimes it takes a while for
the marketplace to catch up.

Don't worry.
Definitely helping Hunter.

This dude's album
just went gold.

Gold?

For real.
How is that even...

That's a mistake, right?

Our shit hasn't even gone gold.

Look, he's just having
a moment, that's all.

CONNER: Well, how come
I'm not having a moment?

You've had tons of moments.

Don't worry,
there's plenty to go around.

DJ:
Hey, yo!

Shout-out to T.I. in the house.

(cheering)
What's up, soulja?

What's up, kid? Okay!

Uh-oh, y'all.

My man Hunter the Hungry's
in the house!

Yo, make some noise!

(wild cheering)

Yeah!
What's up, kid? Hey, yo.

Y'all want to hear the hottest
song in the streets right now?

(crowd cheering)

(dramatic hip-hop music
playing)

It's on.
â™ª Stomping through the forest â™ª

â™ª Like a retarded
tyrannosaurus â™ª

â™ª Hunter eating beefcakes in
the back of a Ford Taurus... â™ª

RZA:
Hey, look, man,

Conner got all the way to the
top of this business, you know?

And the higher you get,
the harder you fall.

I mean, ask any coconut.
PHARRELL: Thing is is that

Conner's never been as good
as he was with the Style Boyz.

Whatever him and Lawrence
were beefing over,

they need to figure out
a way to squash it.

CONNER:
Ever since Style Boyz broke up,

Lawrence has been mad at me.

He claims he wrote
my famous catchphrase verse.

Translation:
He's a jealous-ass hater

who's mad that I blew up
and he's a farmer

out in bum-fuck nowhere.

But, you know,

we all have our take.

Uh, this one here,
this is my Poppy.

Uh, it's what I got

for writing Conner's famous
catchphrase verse.

If you look close, you'll
notice that it's not real,

because I didn't get a Poppy
or credit of any kind.

But there is one person that
I absolutely have to thank,

and that person is me!

Me, myself and I!

I did it all by myself!
(crowd cheering)

Nobody helped me!

So...

Yeah. (sniffs)

That's my Poppy.

CONNER:
If he's so great,

how come he's not
making anything, you know?

Nothing's stopping him
from going out

and writing a bunch of hits.

LAWRENCE: After the Style Boyz,
I tried some solo projects,

but none of them
really took off.

â™ª Old boots, paper towels â™ª

â™ª Shopgirl, a novella â™ª

â™ª Deodorant, house keys â™ª

â™ª Sweatshirt, an umbrella â™ª

â™ª A golf club, basketball â™ª

â™ª Bug spray, a laundry heap â™ª

â™ª A pocketknife, a battery â™ª

the things in my Jeep! â™ª

â™ª These are
the things in my Jeep... â™ª

NAS: I didn't really relate
to that song,

because, you know, I-I had
different things in my Jeep

than he had in his Jeep.

LAWRENCE: I don't think
Conner's living real life.

I think he's in a bubble
with people

telling him
what he wants to hear

and kissing his ass all day.

I heard he's getting
into stage gimmicks now.

He's got Owen in a helmet,
looking dumb.

And one where he sings
from a toilet.

Someone should've told him
that shit's wack,

but he's so afraid of failure,

man, he's just
getting desperate.

CONNER:
Let's try it again.

(ripping)
Oh! Oh, it snagged!

What's up, my confidants?

Be sure to come through

to my show tonight.

I'm trying
a brand-new magic trick.

You know, they said
it couldn't be done,

that the trick was designed
for a woman,

and my junk would get
all tangled.

But I figured out
how to solve it.

I think if I just
tuck it all back...

See ya tonight.

Let's go!

(crowd cheering, pop music playing)
Hey!

What is this, y'all?

I said upscale.
You took me to outer space.


What do you say
we take it back down to Earth?


What?

This almost looks like

something that a cowboy
might wear.

Are y'all looking at my chaps?

(crowd cheering)

But enough horsing around.
Let's take things uptown.

How about a good
old-fashioned tuxedo?

There is no substitute.

Top of the world!

(crowd groaning, murmuring)

Oh, shit.
GIRL: Where is it?

CONNER:
No, uh, no.

It's tucked. I...

I shaved for the trick!

Don't post those pics!
NARRATOR: As they approached

the edge of the Dark Forest...
It's an illusion.

It's tucked, I tuck it back.

OWEN:
Conner, just hold on.

CONNER: Don't post those.
It's a tuck-and-tape!

I don't know what to do
right now.

I want to show y'all my dick,
but I can't show you my dick!

It's a great conundrum.
It's a great conundrum!

Holy shit, dude, where the fuck
was your dick, dawg?

What happened out there?!
(Hunter laughs)

What happened to the trick?

Conner, don't worry.
Nobody saw anything.

I wish they had seen something!

Now there's 10,000 people
that think I got no dick!


Wait, you guys know
I have a dick, right?

Yeah. It's just...
You do. You-you do.

Yes.
I've always believed you had a dick.

R-Right, right, right,
but, like, where was it though?

Because that motherfucker
was gone.

We've gone over this. I...

You know I got to tuck
my shit back

so it doesn't get tangled up
in the garments.

Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
Of course.

Got to put it
in between the legs.

Conner, don't worry about it.

You were up there
for, like, ten seconds.

Ten seconds is
an eternity, Harry!

It's a third
of the way to Mars!

Conner, we've talked
about this.

30 Seconds to Mars
is the name of a band.

It's not a fact.

HUNTER:
Hey, look, thank you, dawg,

because this shit
was hilarious, fam!

Well, I'm so glad that I could
entertain you, Hunter.

You wouldn't happen to know
anything about this, would you?

Ah. (scoffs) I wish.

genius prank shit right here.

Next level.

You would have to be
the best prankster of all time

to think of something
like this.

And, well, shit, that's...
shit, that's me.

Maybe I did do it.

Nah, I didn't do it.

Or did I?

Nah, I didn't.

Or maybe I did.

Not. Do it.

Did you?!
(laughs) I didn't do it.

Or I did.

Who knows?! I don't! (laughs)

Conner, don't worry,
don't worry.

This is not news.

(over TV): Don't post those!
(laughter)

What the fuck?!

The timing of that was crazy!

ANNOUNCER: Conner dickless?
They should call him

NoDick4Real.



(hysterical laughter)


It was tucked, Linda.
It's part of the show.

No, no, don't print that!
CONNER: Everywhere I look.

This is insane.

Now it's on the front page
of USA Today,

the most respected newspaper
in the world?

Sweetie, relax.

All we need is
a different story

to wipe it out of the press cycle.
Mm-hmm.

Okay, so what? What do we do?

Anything.
Uh, release a new single.

Get a crazy haircut.

Or, uh, take an ugly teenager
to the prom.

All good ideas.

Let's keep thinking about it.

And I'm gonna go tweet
a picture of my dick.

Okay, don't really do that.

CONNER: Ah, man,
I just think it's gonna really

change people's perception
of me

in a good, positive way.

And also, I'm really glad
about the fact

that we'll get married, too,
'cause I like her so much.

ASHLEY:
Conner, what's going on?

CONNER: You'll see.
(gentle music playing)

ASHLEY:
Oh, my God, is that music?

CONNER:
Yeah.

Almost there. And...

Uh-huh?

You ready?
Mm-hmm.


ASHLEY:
Are those real wolves?

CONNER:
Yeah.

Conner!

My psychic told me

that in my previous life,
I was a wolf.

Which makes so much sense.

But I can't believe
that Conner remembered.

And you invited the press?

Yeah.

â™ª I landed in London â™ª

â™ª At a quarter to noon... â™ª

Oh, my God.
Is that, is that Seal?

CONNER: Yeah.
ASHLEY: What is this?

What's going on?

(wolf howling)

â™ª I know she's exquisite â™ª

â™ª So I had to visit â™ª
(wolves howling)

â™ª Push my back
to the front... â™ª

Ever since I met you,
I knew in my heart

that you were super bangin'.

(laughs)
(wolves snarling)

Hey, uh, dude,
you got to kill this music.

The wolves are going crazy.

(howling continues)

I can't stop Seal from singing.

â™ª With impeccable style... â™ª
(wolves snarling)

Sorry, could we get the wolves
to be more quiet?

No.

â™ª You're the only girl
that I want to think... â™ª

Ashley Wednesday...

will you marry me?

â™ª Please freaking
say yes, girl... â™ª

Yes! (laughs) Yes!

The wolves are loose!
(people screaming)

Shit!
Shit! Okay.

Oh, God!
Go, run, now!

(wolves snarling)

(screaming continues)
(gunfire)

Run!

HELICOPTER REPORTER:
Jesus Christ!

We got wild animals...
(gunshot)

(screaming continues)

Seal!

Seal, come on!

Hurry!
(sighs)

Are you okay?
I'm fine. For a second...

(snarling)
(screaming)

Seal!
Seal!

Shit! Oh!
(neck snaps)


Seal!
Oh, my God! You got him, dude!

Don't worry. I've been
in this situation before.

How do you think
I got these scars?

From wolves?
Fucking wolves.

(engine starts)
Now, let's get out of here...

(screaming)
(wolf snarling)

What the fuck?!

Go! Go!
Go!

(screaming)
We killed Seal!

He's dead! Seal is dead!
He's dead!

REPORTER: Conner4Real is being
sued by R&B singer Seal for...

Why would he do that to Seal?

I don't even know...
Conner4Real is such a joke.

He disappointed all of us.
I mean...

Did you see that proposal?
It was so fake.

Like, I don't even think
they like each other.

Why did they do that to Seal?

He doesn't even have a dick.

I used to like Conner4Real,
but now I wish

he would just go away.

(crowd cheering)
JIMMY FALLON: My first guest,

Conner4Real!

CONNER: I just want
to thank Seal again

and wish him a fast recovery.

He's gonna be fine.

That's great news.
(applause)

That's great news,
and congrats again

to you and Ashley.
Thank you, thank you.

And, you know, don't forget
CONNquest in stores now.

Cop that.
Yeah, absolutely.
(crowd cheering)

Absolutely.

Can I, can I just fanboy out
for a second?

Uh, because
my-my favorite thing of yours

from-from back in the day, the "Donkey Roll."
Oh.

You guys know...
(crowd cheering)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
For the kids out there,

The "Donkey Roll" is
from Conner's old group

the Style Boyz.

When I...
(crowd cheering)

Yeah.
You know what I'm saying? I don't want to brag,

but I used to do a mean
"Donkey Roll" back in college.

I'm just saying.
Oh, for real?

Some-some said I-I did it
better than yours.

Oh.
(crowd oohing)

Come on, now.
No...

Don't do that, Jimmy Fallon.
(laughter)

I think I saw
Kid Contact backstage.

Do you think that we could
get him out here and...?

(crowd cheering)

I doubt he'd be into it.

(wild cheering)

Y'all set me up?

Oh!

Okay, I'll be filling in
for Kid Brain!

Roots, "Donkey Roll" up!

â™ª Let me see that donkey roll â™ª

â™ª Donkey roll... â™ª

I loved the "Donkey Roll."

USHER: The "Donkey Roll"
was the shit.

That's the reason why I dance.

WIN BUTLER:
Every junior high dance

had to end with
the "Donkey Roll."

USHER: I dreamed of doing
the "Donkey Roll"

onstage with them.

â™ª Donkey roll. â™ª

(crowd cheering)
Yo, everybody!

OWEN: It's all right!
Thank you, buddy.

Yo, dude,
how fun was that shit?

Are you serious?
Yeah.

I wish Lawrence
could've been here.

Owen, that sucked.

I'm trying to sell a record,
not stroll down memory lane.

That shit made me look
like a has-been.


The crowd loved it.

Whatever, man.

(door opens)

All right.


HARRY: Well, look, you have
to understand something.

Conner's lived
a very blessed life.

He got very successful
very, very young.

MAN: No, no, no...
HARRY: And because of that,

he never really learned
to handle adversity

in an adult way.

How many people here

bought my new album,
CONNquest?

(crowd cheering)
All y'all liars!

I know you didn't buy it!

Do you guys even
like me anymore?

REPORTER:
Could've seen this coming.

Conner4Real dumped by
new fiancÃ©e Ashley Wednesday.

PAPARAZZI:
Hey, Conner!

Why did Ashley dump you, brah?

Get the fuck off my ass.
Yo, man!

CONNER: Son of a bitch!
Yo, I could really use you

out here, man.
Mm-hmm.

Yo, w-we're in Denver tomorrow.
(Conner yelling, glass breaks)

Come through.
I-I'll send a car for you.

He really wants to apologize?

Yes, dude.
(goat bleating)

Stop. Down.

This business
can be crazy, man.

That's why it's so important

to be around people
that you trust,

that you've grown up with.

(laughs) I mean...
What is that?

OWEN:
And plus, Lawrence was always

the one who could
cheer Conner up.

You know?


Mm-hmm.
Dude, please.

He really needs
his real friends right now.

He needs you.

(goat bleating)

Yo, what's that sound
in the background?

Oh, it's just, uh,

my girlfriend.

I'm having sex with her.

All right, man. Uh, maybe.

You know, maybe.
I'll think about it.

OWEN: So last night,
I caught a little bit

of this obscure old movie

called The Parent Trap,
right?

And in that movie, these two
little redheaded girls,

they get the idea to trick
their divorced parents

into falling back in love
with each other.

So I was like, yo,

if I just get
Lawrence and Conner

in the same room together,

boom, they're gonna realize
that they're friends,

and we all
can all be buddies again.

â™ª â™ª

TYRUS:
â™ª Mona Lisa â™ª

â™ª You're an overrated piece
of shit â™ª

â™ª What the fuck
is this garbage? â™ª

CONNER:
Tyrus! Shut up, man!

We're watching TV.
Quiet, dude!

Leave the singing to the
professionals, please. Yeah?

You're right. I-I'm sorry.

And cut softer, dawg.

â™ª Dedicated to the people
of Ethpania... â™ª

CONNER:
We were on the road in Spain,

and I noticed
that the people there

pronounce the letter "S"

with, like, a T-H,
"the," sound.

So instead of saying "Spain,"

they say "Thpain," you know?

And it's like the whole country
has a crazy speech impediment.

Um, so I wrote a "thong"
about that.

â™ª Now theeng!
In Ibithathathathathatha â™ª

â™ª Every day's
a fiethta-thta-thta â™ª

â™ª Speakers boom on the
dance floor, floor, floor... â™ª

Don't post those pics!
Don't post those pics!

â™ª Everyone is a thtar,
thtar, thtar, thtar â™ª

â™ª Our tummies are full
of pae-jhay-ah... â™ª

(whooping)
All right!

Ah, thanks, man.
Man, good shit!

You dropped it perfect
right on that one.

Oh, thanks, man.
Oh, thanks.

Oh, hey, um, I invited Lawrence

to come to
the after-party tonight.

So he might be here.
What? Lawrence is here?

Yeah, man.
Oh, you know, I told you

he lives right nearby here,
so I just thought

it'd be cool for him to come.

He actually, he wanted
to apologize to you...

Owen.

Are you trying
to Parent Trap us?

No.

CONNER:
God, he looks like a caveman.

Look at this fool.
He's about to murder somebody.

OWEN: I think it's just
the lighting in the limo.

What?!
No, seriously.

I think that...
that's just his resting face.

He's just relaxing.
So what, he just

apologizes to me, and I'm
supposed to forgive him,

and then we go back to being
a big, happy family?

Something like that.

Yeah.


OWEN:
Style Boyz.

In the house. Right?

Nah. Fuck this.
No.
No. No.

Fans got through the gate.

We got to lock up.
LAWRENCE: Let me out, man.

Yo, unlock the doors.

Yeah, you should go, man.
Bail... that's your move.

That's not my move.
That's your move. You bailed.

I didn't bail.
People like me best,

and you couldn't handle it,
so I did my own thing.

People like you best
'cause of the shit I wrote.

They don't like your shit,
they like my shit,

and they don't even know it.
Take a look around, Lawrence.

If you were so important
to my success,

how come my solo shit's
way bigger

than Style Boyz ever was?

You had Owen making
all your beats.

And now you ditched him,
and your shit's tanking.

Why can't you just give me
any credit, man?

Just admit that I'm talented.

Why can't you admit that
I wrote the catchphrase verse?

Oh, this shit again.
None of this garbage out here

is possible without me.
GIRL: Conner!

Admit that shit.
I love you!

Man, what the fuck
is going on out there?

WOMAN: Conner, sign my tits!
Oh, what, this?

This is just some
beautiful-ass titties, man.

My fans ask me to sign them
all the time,

because they love me,
and I love them, Lawrence.

And you know what?
You need to grow up, dude.

Because this right here,

this is what it's all about,
my friend.

Making art.

Connecting with people.

This is that rock star life,
my man,

and I'm slurping it down
like a big old

fat milkshake.
Hey, Conner?

Not now, Owen! I'm gonna sign these titties.
I'm just...

So sit back and watch
how it's done, my friend.

I'm gonna... Oh, shit!
Oh! It's a dick!

That's one of your fans, man.
Go for it.

Ooh!
Can you make it out to Jenna?

Oh, hello.
That's me.

It's nice to meet you.

That's my fiancÃ©'s penis.
Ah.

MAN: Big fan.
Thanks, man. So tight.

Okay, he's inside.

I'm just gonna...

(nervous chuckling)

...do the old John Hancock.

Are you guys getting
back together? Style Boyz?

No.
No. Right on.
We're thinking about it.

I'm gonna roll
the window up now, so just...

Thanks for coming by.

Great to meet you guys.
I rest my case, Lawrence.

You think you know what's up,
but in fact,

you, my friend,
have no idea what's going on.

Don't call me again.

Lawrence, dude.

Don't leave like that.

Shit.

We should probably hit
the car wash.

(thunder crashes)

(dramatic hip-hop music
playing)

â™ª All work and no play â™ª

â™ª Make Hunter go crazy â™ª

â™ª All play and no work â™ª

â™ª Make Hunter feel
just as depressed â™ª

â™ª I'm O.J., I'm Simpson â™ª

â™ª I'm Martha, I'm Plimpton... â™ª

Finally heard back
from the Poppies.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah. They-they love you.

Um, they just...

they just don't have
enough room for you this year.

What? For real?

Yeah, it's a bummer. I know.

I told them to keep us in mind
if anything changes.

It could come around.

HARRY:
This business is tough.

The highs are high,
and the lows are low.

You know? It's like a wave.

You just got to learn
how to ride the wave, you know?

It's up and down,
just like that.

Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! TonEe?

Bartending.

Style Boyz.

Conner4Real.


That means I might be
going down again soon.

â™ª Hey-ya, hey-ya, ho,
hey-ya, hey-ya, ho... â™ª

Harry, he's 30 minutes over.

I'm sure he'll be done soon.

I'm never gonna leave
this stage!

I'm gonna die up here!
(crowd cheering)

All right, that's it.

Owen, get your gear.

Got it.
Frank, cue it up.

Conner, what are you doing?

I'm going on, Harry!

You better get a bedpan!

I'm-a be here all night, bitch!

(cheering)
Who came here to see Hunter the Hungry, huh?

(electronic warbling)

CONNER:
And who came here to see

Conner4Real?

(crowd cheering)

CONNER:
What's up, y'all?


What'd you just say?
(hip-hop music playing)

Contact, skip the intro.

Go to "Humble."
â™ª Stompin' through the forest â™ª

â™ª Like a retarded
tyrannosaurus... â™ª

("I'm So Humble"
playing simultaneously)

â™ª Y'all know I be
the most humblest... â™ª

â™ª In the back of a Ford Taurus,
fuck a chorus... â™ª

â™ª On top of the humble list,
my... â™ª

(electronic tone blaring)

(crowd screaming)

All right, Harry, we got to talk.
I know.

That was a mess out there tonight.
Yeah.

We have to get rid of Hunter.

We can't fire Hunter, Conner.

I mean, he's one of the reasons
that the tour sold out.

I want him off the tour.

Well, look, he's number one
on BonkoHub right now.

Well, what number are we?

Numbers don't matter.
Come on, you know that.

God.
Hey, could we talk about this helmet?

It's crazy heavy, and it's really hurting my back.
Owen,

why are you talking right now?
Why are you in this meeting?

I'm in all of our meetings.

Dude, just leave, all right?

Go have a meeting
with Lawrence.

You know, it's not my fault

that the album's
not selling, okay?

Don't take it out on me.

Great.

Harry, we have to get rid
of Hunter, all right?

I'm not asking, I'm telling.

You represent me, not him.

Okay, look, well, actually...

technically...

Full disclosure:
I represent both of you.

What?

Yeah.

You signed him?

Conner, come on.

Are you kidding me, Harry?

It's just business.

It's not to me!

All right, look,
decide right now, him or me.

Come on, don't go there.

Look, I got a family to feed.

What? No, you don't!

I have a niece.
We all have a niece!

You know what?


Conner, you... you're just...

you're upset
and you're overreacting.

Okay, now I got
to collate that.

Great. Have fun collating.

There's no fun in collating!

CONNER:
What's up, my confidants?

Who can you really trust?

I thought
I could trust my manager,

but it turned out
he was stabbing me in the back

the whole time.

I thought I could trust Seal.

I thought I could trust
the Yelp reviews

of PartyWolves.com.

Really makes you think,
doesn't it?

Who's out there,
scheming behind my back,

trying to take what I built?

I need to find out
who I can really trust.

â™ª â™ª

(dog barking in distance)


(whistling a tune)

All right, y'all,
come and get 'em!

Conner's fancy flapjacks! Right here!
Whoa!

(laughs)
Wow!
Thanks, Conn.

Eat up, eat up, eat up, eat up.

(low grunting)

Mm!
Sponge,

you liking those pancakes?

They're so good. Yeah.
Yeah.

Eddie? Feeling these?


Okay.
Mm-hmm.


I can't.
Conn, these are terrible, man.

I'm really sorry.

Thank you, Owen.

Truly.

Okay.
And the rest of you liked them?

Yeah.

Yup. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Well... that's
very disappointing,

because they are not good.

I knew it.
And the reason they're not good

is because
I put dog shit in them.

What?!
Aw, dang, dude!

That's nasty!
Oh, that's... hilarious.
(coughing)

The reason that I did that

is to see
who would tell me the truth!

Oh... Conn, that's mad smart!

Yeah, he's always two steps ahead.
CONNER: No.

No, stop doing that, you guys.

This is what I'm talking about.
You can't just agree

with everything I say.
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.

It's not helpful.
Got to be honest.

No, you're doing it again,
all right? Just stop!

You fed us dog shit?

What is wrong with you?!
Owen, chill out, man.

You're the only one who
passed the test. You're good.

How the fuck can you think I
was one of your lackeys, dude?

I'm your oldest friend.

Hey, we're friends!
We're all friends.

I should've told you
to fuck off years ago,

but instead
I just let you become

a bigger and bigger dick.
Look, I'm sorry,

but I've kept you on the tour,
I keep you paid,

I put food on the table!

With dog shit in it!

It's the thought
that counts, man!

Oh, my God, that's it.
I quit.

You can't quit.

What do I even do anymore,
Conner?

I push play on an iPod
in a robot costume.

All right, fine, then.

Go.

Fine.

Fine.

Fine.

(birds chirping)

CONNER:
Maximus?

I'm home, buddy.

Sometimes he kicks it in here.

Max!

(chittering in distance)

You hear that?


Max?

What are you doing?

What's wrong with you?

Why are you all white?
(chittering)

Why is he making that sound?

(retching)
Oh! Oh, fuck!

There's something wrong
with Maximus!

His scales are all ashy.
Come on!

(tires screech)

(reporters clamoring)
No! Get out of the way!

Move! Come on!

Please, please move!
My turtle is sick!

I got to get him
to the hospital!

He's gonna die!
(chittering)

Maximus...!

(bagpipes playing
"Amazing Grace")

CONNER: As I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

I take a look at my life and
realize there's nothing left.

Maximus was my best friend,

who struggled daily
with soggy bone syndrome,

but never complained once.

MAN: ...Conner4Real
fighting with Martin Sheen

gets knocked the "F" out.
The guy from The West Wing?

Attica! Attica! Attica!
Things going from bad to worse

for Conner4Real,
seen unconscious

rolling around town
on a hoverboard.

CONNER:
Now go, and join your family

in turtle heaven.

(bagpipes continue playing
"Amazing Grace")

(crowd cheering)
Fuck yeah!

â™ª Flirty, sexy,
flirty, flirty â™ª

â™ª Flirty, sexy, flirty,
flirty â™ª

â™ª Flirty, sexy, flirty, flirty,
flirty, sexy... â™ª

(cheering and music
distorting, fading)

USHER:
It's time, man.

You got to know
when to go home.

Bro, you got to know
when to let go.

The key is don't play yourself.
That's it.

Very simple.

Don't play yourself.

Congratulations.
You played yourself.

You guys win.

I get the message.
I'll go away.

This is Conner4Real
signing off.

CONNER:
So, I am back in Sac,

house-sitting for my mom,

'cause she's on tour
Oh, shit.

with Fallout Boy.
You guys filming me?

It's been awesome, you know?
(groans): Oh.

Dude, which one of y'all
pissed on me?

Feels really good to reconnect with my hometown.
(sighs)

I've just been really living
a very simple life.

Kind of... back to basics.

I've been watching
a lot of dressage,

which is a very elevated,
uh, competitive form

of horse dancing.

I've been doing
a lot of painting

and a lot of sketching.

Um, I'm doing a series
on show ponies.

I actually have a lot
of trouble with the hooves.

It's hard to get, like,
a hoove texture.

This one is, like,
pretty accurate, actually.

I'll show you guys the horse
that I based it on. Anyway...

It's not my best one.

Um, like, in retrospect,
I probably wouldn't have used

that shade of green.
I've even been selling

some of them online,

which has been a cool,
new experience.

Ooh! Sold.

11.50.
You know, it's not

Conner4Real numbers, you know?

But in a way it means more.

That's pretty much it,
you know?

That's my life now.

(percussive music,
rhythmic grunting)

(tapping on door)

(door opens)

Hello.

Hey! What's up, dude?

You guys, Paula's here!

What's going on?

Just wanted to check up on you.

You want a drink?

Uh, no. It's 11:00.
It's 11:00 in the morning.

It's 11:30 somewhere.

KIDS (over TV):
Go! Touchdown...

(kids chanting)

CONNER:
Can we please turn this off?

Look at those little nerds!

We were very cool
for our school district.

My birthday is awesome.

CONNER:
Yeah, man, we used to have fun.

What the fuck happened?

TILLY (over TV):
Okay.

CONNER:
Oh, shit.

I think this is the day
that my mom gave me Maximus.

Oh.

This one is from...
Owen and Lawrence!

A turtle! A turtle!
(others gasping)

Oh, my goodness!
Look, Mom! They got me a turtle!

TILLY:
What do you say, sweetie?

YOUNG CONNER:
Thank you!

BOTH:
You're welcome.

TILLY: Honey,
what are you gonna name it?

I'm gonna name it Maximus.

PAULA:
Get up. We're going out.

What?
Oh, no, I'm not going out.

I cannot deal with the public
right now.

Conner, it's not a question.


(smacks lips)

All right, fine.

But if we're going out...

I got to put on my makeup.

Please don't put that on.

(hip-hop music playing)

This is cool.

Feels good to be out.

You were right. Yeah.
Good.

I'm glad I did this though.

You know, it makes me feel
more comfortable, more at ease.

I feel at ease.

Yeah, you look really comfortable.
Yeah.

You look like Matthew Modine
had a peanut allergy.

All right.

You look like Nazi propaganda.

Okay, that's foul.

(techno music playing)
(crowd cheering)

(mellow keyboard intro plays)
CONNER: Wait a minute.

(crowd cheering)


That piano part is incredible!

(off-key):
â™ª Earth, wind and birds â™ª

â™ª They sit around my park â™ª

â™ª Up with â™ª

â™ª Darkness so cold. â™ª

(techno beat playing)
(crowd cheering)

Was my last album bad?

I feel like I probably could've
handled myself a little better

over the past few months.

It feels so nice to be able
to say all this shit,

'cause the music is so loud
no one can hear me!

That equal rights song
was offensive!

I feel free!

(whoops)
(laughs)

Thanks for coming out, you guys.
(women laugh)

Means a lot.
Great show, Kid Contact!

Conner?

Aw, man!
How'd you recognize me?

What's up, man?
What are you doing here?

Had to put on the disguise,
right?

Yeah, no, I see that.

Come check out
my homie do his thing, man.

Great show!
(chuckles)

Thanks, man.
Yeah, yeah.

Oh. Paula brought you?

She did.

And I'm really glad she did.

It was such a great show.
You sounded incredible, dude.

Thanks, man.
Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, my singing's terrible,
but, you know.

What? No! No...!

But, I mean, all right, look,
may be time

for some vocal lessons,
you know? No shame in that.

Yeah, or you know
who would sound better on it.

(smacks lips) Clay Aiken.

No. You.

No. No, man. (chuckles)

This is your thing, and
I'm hella proud of you, man.

And...

fuck, man, I just...

I want to just say I'm sorry.
Conner, just, I...

like, I love that
you're doing this right now,

but it's really hard
to take you seriously,

because you just look like
Jason Segel right now.

Oh, Paula said that.
Well, we have great minds.

Yeah, that's funny.
Yeah, it must, like...

How is it, like...?
Oh, yeah, it's, like,

the spitting image of, like...
Is that good? Like...

Yeah, it looks identical
to that dude.

Sarah Marshall.

I need to forget about her.

Yeah, he needs to forget her.
Yeah. Yeah.

Love that movie.
Yeah.

Thanks, man.

It means a lot
that you came out.

I'm glad I came, too. For real.

That's good, man.

(birds chirping)

(exhales sharply)

Nice.

What the fuck?

One of you guys put this here?

(wind whistling softly)

Hey, Lawrence.

Conner.

Owen.

Lawrence.

Conner.

Just... (grunts)

That's for you, man.

To borrow, you know?

Figured...

you could take a bunch of pics
of you holding it and stuff,

you could post them
or whatever.

All right? So...

...now we're cool.


Lawrence!

What the fuck, man?

Now I got to go find that!

What do you want me to say?

That you helped
with the catchphrase verse?

Is that what this is
still about?

Fine. You helped with the
catchphrase verse. All right?

You happy?

All right,
and you wrote most of it.

But using my catchphrases.

That you also cowrote.

All right, wrote.

But we were both in the room,

and I dictated
all the best stuff.

All right,
none of the best stuff, dude,

but I had tons of great ideas

that I still don't even know
why you didn't use them.

Because they sucked!

Okay, fine. That's my bad.

But I was there
the whole time, man.

I was a little late.
I was a little late that day.

There was traffic,
and I was a little tardy

on that particular day.

There was no traffic.
I lied about that.

I lied about it because
I overslept on accident.

It was on purpose.
It was a power move.

I was trying to send a message,
and that was

a dick move on my part,
all right?

However, once I got there...
late...

I put in time, okay?

I left a little early,
I remember that.

I was never there.
Now I remember.

I remember now what happened!

I bailed, and you wrote
the whole verse.

You wrote it,
and I never gave you credit.

'Cause guess why.

No one cares who writes shit.

They just care who performs it.

In fact, I think the only
person in the whole universe

who cares about the credit
for who wrote it is you!


Fuck.

(clears throat)

I'm sorry.

Boom.

Parent Trap.


CONNER: What'd you say
you grew here again?

You'll see.

Oh, shit!

Lawrence,
how much weed do you have?

Hey, everyone, I'm gonna take
the rest of the day off

to hang out with my friends.

Keep up the good work, and...

let's have a great harvest.
MAN: Okay!

You guys still smoke?
BOTH: Yeah.

â™ª â™ª

Cheers, dude.
Cheers.

Witch's Titty, Aqua Butt,

Beethoven's Nightmare,
Postpartum Depression,

Frog Jizz, Purple Durban...

It's really up there, man.
Good shot there, Lawrence.

All right, one, two, three.
(grunting)

Oh.
Got it?
Get it.

Ah! Ha-ha!
Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah.

No way this works.

Get it.
No. No!

Yeah.
You smoked the Poppy, dude!


What was that beat
that we were messing with once

that was, like...

â™ª Bwah, bwah, bwah, bwah â™ª

(Lawrence joins in):
â™ª Bwah, bwah, bwah, bwah â™ª

â™ª Bwah, bwah. â™ª

Yeah!
What was that?

(high-pitched):
â™ª Bwah, bwah, bwah, bwah â™ª

â™ª Bwah, bwah, bwah, bwah,
bwah, bwah. â™ª

We should mess with that.

â™ª â™ª

ALL:
Oh!

That was it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How'd it go though?

What were the words though?
What were the words?

It was, uh...
â™ª Dah, dah, dah, buh, buh â™ª

â™ª You are
my number one pick... â™ª

That was it!
Yeah! Yeah!

â™ª But every time I call you â™ª

â™ª You say that you're sick... â™ª

She was always sick.
Lawrence hooked up with her!

Aw, come on.
That's right! You hooked up with her!

Don't do me like that.
(laughter)

Come on, yo.

â™ª Glenda, are you dying â™ª

â™ª Or just avoiding me? â™ª

CONNER:
That was it.

â™ª Either way's a bummer â™ª

â™ª But I hope you're dying... â™ª

That was messed up. He wrote that.
Yeah.

LAWRENCE:
Pretty fun in there, man.

I forgot how fun it is.

Kind of makes me think

that I fucking hate farming.

I look at Conner,
and I see that

seven-year-old scrub
that I grew up with, and...

it's like, how could you
be mad at a seven-year-old?

It's crazy I spent so much time
thinking about killing him.

(bird screeches)

You guys see that? (laughs)

You missed me!


Conner's full of surprises
these days, man.

I mean,
on our way from the airport,

I actually noticed
something crazy.

I looked down, and in his bag
he had this book

called
How to Be a Better Friend.

It was all dog-eared
and scribbled on.

It feels like
he's really trying.

And plus, it shows
he knows how to read,

which is really heartening.

(whoops)
I can't believe we remembered that, man.

Paula's calling you.

Yo, there was
a whole second verse

in that, too, remember that?
Yeah, what was it, dude?

I'm gonna grab it, I'm gonna grab it.
Okay.

You remember that?
Yeah.
(Conner sighs)

Yo.

PAULA:
Where the hell have you been?

Um, hanging with the guys.

It's actually been
super fun, man.

Conner, you just got offered
the Poppy Awards.

Wait, what?

The Poppy Awards!

Taylor Swift was arrested
for murder.

They want you
to close the show.

It is a huge spot.

Six minutes to do
whatever you want.

But they need an answer now.

Oh, shit. Um...

This is what we've been
waiting for, Conner!

â™ª She never wore socks... â™ª

But that was
the third verse though.

I'm talking about the second verse.
Okay.

Yeah. Yeah.
Like, what was the second verse?

â™ª Her daddy hates me â™ª

â™ª 'Cause my car â™ª

â™ª Is slick. â™ª
Yes!
Okay.

Yeah, yeah.
Let's record it.
Oh, hell yeah.

Let me get on the boards.
What did Paula want, man?

Oh, nothing. They wanted me
to do the Pop Awards,

but I passed on it.

Yo, what?
Dude, I don't want

to do that shit.
I'm hanging with you guys.

Who fucking cares, dude?
That's the Poppies.

All right, but I thought
this was, like,

the whole reason
you guys were mad at me,

for going and doing
all this solo shit.

Dude, you don't have to choose
between us and your solo shit.

It's like with Wu-Tang Clan.
It's like,

you're Method Man,
and he made a solo record,

but he's still
in the Wu-Tang Clan.

He never stopped
being in the Wu-Tang Clan.

Right.
Or, like, the GZA.

He was in the Wu-Tang Clan,
and then he made a solo record.

He never stopped being
in the Wu-Tang Clan.

OWEN:
Yeah. Or you're the RZA,

and you could do
your solo shit,

but you're still
in the Wu-Tang Clan.

So basically...

we're the Wu-Tang Clan.

Exactly. But better.

Yeah. Well...

As soon as I said it, I was
kind of like, uh, maybe not.

It's like
we're three Tom Pettys

and we're the Heartbreakers,
you know?

You're a Tom Petty,

you're Tom Petty,
and I'm Tom Petty,

but together...

We're Tom Petty.
...we're the Heartbreakers.

Oh, right, no.
We're the Heartbreakers.

Yeah, I lost it, too.
Yeah.

We know you got to fly.

You're like a beautiful bird...
you got to be

out there,
you got to see it all,

but we can be
right there with you,

as your little bird legs.

So you think I should...
do the Pop Awards?

Fuck yes!
Yeah.

All right, well,
I'm not going alone.

Who are you gonna do it with?

With you guys!
Oh.

Do you want to come with me?
Oh, shit.
Yeah, yeah.

That's tight.
I was wondering who you were gonna...

All right.
We're so high!
That's tight.

â™ª â™ª

ANNOUNCER:
And the stars are arriving

for this year's
Pop Music Awards, the Poppies.

â™ª â™ª

Good. Let's go.
You guys are all set.

They know you're doing
one Style Boyz song,

and then we're gonna go into
Conner's, uh, new single.

Great.

HUNTER:
Oh, shit!

Conner, what up though, dawg?

Oh. Yeah, what up, Hunter?
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

Say hey to my doc
real quick, baby.

Hi.
Yeah!

Hey, you got a doc,
I got a doc.

You know what I'm saying?
But now...

like, I'm rolling with all
these dudes and with Aquaspin.

Like, I kind of
Single White Female'd your ass.

Yeah, man, that's crazy.
Anyway, though, my man.

Good to see you, man.
You looking spiffy, you know?

Yo, yo, this Hunter, dawg.
I'm 'bout to get crazy

on this stage, baby.
WOMAN: Oh, no, sorry, not your camera.

Huh?
We're with Conner.

Oh, shit. My bad.
Yo, this Hunter

about to head into the Poppies,
you know what I'm saying?

MAN:
No, sorry. We're with Snoop.

Surprise, mothafucka!

You're watching
my brand-new show:

Surprise Mothafucka

with Snoop Dogg.

And, mothafucka,
you've been surprised.

(indistinct chatter)
Excuse me.

Excuse me, baby.
Hey, hey, okay, hey.

Can somebody move out the...

â™ª â™ª
(applause)

Hey, Mariah Carey. (sniffs)

Your hair smells
and looks great.

Did you know Aquaspin has
hair dryers and flatirons?

CAREY (chuckles):
No, I didn't.

Aquaspin appliances
are completely affordable

for college students.
(crowd booing)

CAREY: Honey, you're not
doing ads now.

Really? What?
Read the damn prompter.

Yo, you're messing
with my money right now.

What the [bleep] did you just say to me?
What?

HUNTER: Yo, [bleep] all y'all,
all right?

And [bleep] everybody else.
(booing continues)

And [bleep] Mariah Carey
for leaving me up here.

Yeah, I said her.
Okay, say it again.

No, oh, you still here?
I thought you had left.

Style Boyz?

It's time.

HUNTER: Yo, what the fuck
was that, Harry?

Why you got me up there
saying that bullshit, man?

HARRY: I told you not
to say it. You're the one

who wanted to cash the check.

Yo, you set me up, dude!

You ain't nothing but, like,
a fake, sellout, money-hungry

pop, bullshit-ass manager!

You ain't nothing but a Tony!
Toni! TonÃ©! reject, bitch!

What the fuck you say to me?!

Say that shit again,
young blood!

I will eat your head!

I will eat your fucking head!

You better learn some respect!

Yo, all right. Hey, man.

I'm sorry, yo. Chill.

Old-ass motherfucker.

Oh!
Shit.

Why you hit me like that, dawg?

Get yourself a new manager!

Yo, are you serious?

What the hell, man?

(whispers): Oh, my God.
(snickering)

That was great, Harry!

It was insane, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

I was like,
"Hey, get some respect."

You know.

Wow.

Hey, look, Harry,
I just want to say I'm sorry...

No, don't.
Don't worry about it.

Just... get out there
and have a good time.

Good luck, guys.

ALL:
Thanks, Harry.

Yeah. (chuckles)

MAN (over P.A.):
Hammerleg to stage left.

Hammerleg to stage left.
â™ª ...ghost last night... â™ª


You nervous?
For sure.

Little bit.

Don't be. We got this.

All right. See you out there.
See you out there.

MAN (over P.A.):
Conner4Real, 45 seconds.

Please take your seats.
WOMAN: Oh, God, Conner.

There you are. Look,
the show's going way over,

so you only have
three minutes now.

What?
Yeah, you can only do one song,

so I need to know,
are you gonna do Conner4Real

or Style Boyz?
Uh...

Yeah, no, I asked him.

He's just kind of, like,
looking off into space

and, like, really making a meal
out of this.

And now I'm just
standing here waiting.

He's looking off to,
like, contemplate

whether he should, I think,

pick the Style Boyz,
'cause he's, like,

looking in their direction.

So he might be leaning
toward that kind of choi...

No, he's looking back.

So I-I'm lost. I'm not sure
which one he's gonna go for.

All right.
I know what I'm gonna do.

Our final performer tonight
is a living legend

and still a superstar.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the one and only

Conner4Real!

(crowd cheering)

(a cappella): â™ª Finest girl
I ever met in my whole life â™ª

â™ª Wanna take her home,
make her my wife â™ª

â™ª Knew she was a freak
when she started talking â™ª

â™ª She said â™ª

â™ª I'm a Style Boy â™ª

â™ª For life... â™ª
(crowd cheering)

Should we tell 'em?
Yeah.
Tell 'em, man.

We made a new song at the farm.

Yeah, we found
Lawrence's journals,

and they were just amazing.

CONNER:
Amazing.

Just full of
incredible thoughts.

Just, like, ideas and poems
and stuff, nothing special.

Yo, and then Conner had
the idea to take a piano line

from my solo shit...
Conner put it all together.

And the Poppies paired us
with the craziest special guest

to perform with.

â™ª Incredible thoughts â™ª
(crowd cheering)

â™ª Incredible mind â™ª

â™ª I'm so overwhelmed â™ª

â™ª How did my brain
conceive them? â™ª

â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

â™ª A snow-white dove in the pitch-black night â™ª
â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª A raindrop falls from tremendous heights â™ª
â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª A wave crashes off of a cliff
in Scotland â™ª

â™ª A child bites an apple
but the core is rotten â™ª

â™ª TV is free,
but what is the cost? â™ª

â™ª We have GPS,
and yet we're still lost â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª
â™ª A carrot in the desert â™ª

â™ª A camel in the garden â™ª

â™ª A man with giant ears
begging your pardon â™ª

â™ª What if a garbageman
was actually smart? â™ª

â™ª A common misconception
that we're tearing apart â™ª

â™ª And to a dog,
dog food is just food â™ª

â™ª And to a sock,
a mansion's just a big shoe â™ª

sitting in the acid rain â™ª

â™ª A house cat
addicted to the cocaine â™ª

â™ª No teeth, unlimited floss â™ª

â™ª These are just a few of
our incredible thoughts â™ª

â™ª Incredible thoughts... â™ª
NAS: Oh, man, watching

the Style Boyz together
on stage again was like...

I lived to see that.

After that, you know,
take me away, I'm done.

A$AP ROCKY:
Kid Contact, Kid Brain

and Kid Conner
all back together...

the motherfucking Style Boyz.

This is just
some revolutionary shit, man.

My heart is pounding right now.

â™ª Oh, oh â™ª

â™ª A ballerina
waits for the bus â™ª

â™ª A "Number One Dad" trophy
covered in rust â™ª

â™ª A nun dunks a basketball,
living the impossible â™ª

â™ª A man breaks his leg
inside a hospital â™ª

â™ª We just thought of that,
and it could change the world â™ª

â™ª We're like a smart oyster
full of pearls â™ª

â™ª Such as an ultrasound
of a new baby â™ª

â™ª With a Santa hat
drawn on, yeah â™ª

â™ª That's my kind of
Christmas card â™ª

â™ª What if a butterfly
was made out of butter? â™ª

â™ª These small thoughts
could destroy Big Brother â™ª

â™ª The world's cutest kitten
just hugging a dog â™ª

â™ª Just one of many of
our incredible thoughts â™ª

â™ª What if one thought
could cure the people? â™ª

â™ª What if one song
could end all evil? â™ª

â™ª Imagine if a fish
could play guitar â™ª

â™ª And also sing â™ª

â™ª It would sound bizarre,
like â™ª

â™ª My name is Mr. Fish â™ª

â™ª Yeah! â™ª
â™ª These guys' thoughts â™ª

â™ª Have granted my wish,
oh, yeah... â™ª

All I want to know,
who was in that fish costume?

That was amazing.

The fish was me!

Tyrus!

â™ª Ooh... â™ª
Shh.

â™ª Ooh... â™ª

â™ª And that may have just â™ª

â™ª Changed the course of time â™ª
â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

â™ª I swear, my mind
blows my mind â™ª

â™ª Incredible â™ª
(air horn blows)

(crowd cheering)

â™ª Let me see that Donkey Roll â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Donkey Roll â™ª

â™ª Let me see that Donkey Roll â™ª

â™ª Incredible thoughts â™ª

â™ª Donkey Roll â™ª

â™ª Incredible thoughts â™ª

â™ª Let me see that â™ª

â™ª Donkey Roll! â™ª

â™ª Ah... â™ª

â™ª Incredible thoughts,
incredible mind â™ª

â™ª Too many great ideas inside â™ª
â™ª Ooh... â™ª

â™ª It's a miracle
my head can contain them â™ª

â™ª And my spectacular brain... â™ª

(saxophone playing off-key)
ALL: Harry!

â™ª How I think about
space and time â™ª

â™ª Now it's time to share them with the people â™ª
Oh!

â™ª My brain is a genius... â™ª

QUESTLOVE: When it was
happening, I was just like,

yo, I cannot believe

I'm here to witness this, man.

â™ª How did my brain
conceive them? â™ª

(song ends)
(crowd cheering)

Yes! Yes! Fuck!


Yes! (laughs)

I just performed

the "Donkey Roll"
with the Style Boyz.

I was a Style Boy.

(cheering continues)

HARRY:
When I walked out onstage,

all I could think of was,

I'm so happy.

And I really hope that
Tony! Toni! TonÃ©! is watching.

And that they feel like shit.

CONNER:
A wise man once said,

"Everyone's career
is on a wave.

"Sometimes you're up,
sometimes you're down.

"But the trick is not to
lose yourself along the way.

And when you're up,
don't be an asshole about it."

It's like my mom always says...

Yo, what the fuck?

That stage manager lady just
macked on Lawrence super hard.

Yo, do they even
know each other?

Oh, my God!

And why is De-bor-ah here?

Anyways, be cool
to your friends, right?

That's what I was saying?

Yo, they are gonna fuck!

Damn that is hilarious.

But the point is,
be a good person,

and the rest
will fall into place.

And that's Conner4Real.

Isn't that right, Maximus 2?

(laughs)
(chitters)

(high-pitched):
It sure is, Conner.

What? (laughs)

He wasn't really talking.
That was me doing the voice.


(wolf growls)
(yells)

â™ª â™ª

â™ª When the girls blow us kisses â™ª
â™ª Me likey that â™ª

â™ª And when your mama does our dishes â™ª
â™ª Me likey that â™ª

â™ª When a genie grants wishes â™ª
â™ª About girls blowing kisses â™ª

â™ª And your mama doing dishes â™ª
â™ª Me likey that â™ª

â™ª Well, we step up in the party,
no shoes or socks â™ª

â™ª No pants on the bottom â™ª
â™ª No shirts on the top â™ª

â™ª Nude â™ª
â™ª Butt naked at the buffet bar â™ª

â™ª Eatin' up

â™ª And the crude terre,

â™ª Yeah, yeah,

â™ª Why don't you grab Kid Brain

â™ª How's it goin', motherfuckers,

â™ª In his tummy-tum-tum â™ª
â™ª Me likey that. â™ª

â™ª â™ª

The Style Boyz are
getting back together again!

(laughter)
Yeah, they broke up,

then they buried the hatchet,
and now I guess

they're working together again.
(laughter)

They're, like, friends from childhood.
Yeah!
For life!

And they had,
like, tough times,

and now they feel good about
being back together.

Yeah.
We're gonna put aside our differences!


And actually do something.

Because sometimes
I think about doing that.

(laughs): Yeah.
I haven't talked to my mom

in three years.
(laughter stops)

I moved out here,
I thought I could get, like,

a commercial agent.

I just wanted to be
a longboard model.

I never graduated high school.

I never graduated
middle school.

(chuckles softly)
It'd be a lot of fun

if the four of us hung out
outside of the office.

Hey, guys, can I ask you
something really...

that I've never
really asked you before?

Yeah.
Do you guys have a photograph

of James Franco
leaving a Denny's?

Oh, yeah! Totally!
It's right here!

Let's see it!
Put it up!

(laughter)
Bring it up!
We got it!


â™ª â™ª

â™ª Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah â™ª

â™ª Words and truth â™ª

â™ª One fine evening
on the sandy coast â™ª

â™ª The feeling was irie
round the drum circle â™ª

â™ª When the wisest rasta
I ever saw â™ª

â™ª Gently joined us
and sang of Jah â™ª

â™ª Roots and culture
seeped from his bones â™ª

â™ª He took out a spliff
and said, "Pass dis around" â™ª

â™ª So I took a righteous drag â™ª

â™ª It was the best sensie
that I ever had â™ª

â™ª And then I felt the chills
run up my back â™ª

â™ª My good man,
tell me what was that? â™ª

â™ª He said, "My friend,
you just smoked crack" â™ª

â™ª Crack, crack â™ª

â™ª You just smoked crack,
crack â™ª

â™ª Oh, crack, crack â™ª

â™ª You just smoked â™ª

â™ª I just smoked crack â™ª

Oh, my God!

â™ª And it felt fucking great â™ª

This is amazing!

â™ª I thought it was marijuana â™ª

â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

â™ª But now it's too
fucking late â™ª

â™ª I can't go back â™ª

â™ª I love crack â™ª

Holy shit!

â™ª And now I am invincible â™ª

Fuck yeah!

â™ª If anyone tries
to take my crack â™ª

â™ª I'll kill them on principle â™ª

â™ª Some call crack bazooka â™ª

â™ª Others call it base â™ª
â™ª Base â™ª

â™ª But no matter
what name you call it â™ª

â™ª It's the best invention ever â™ª

â™ª By the human race â™ª
â™ª Race â™ª

â™ª The government spread lies
about it â™ª

â™ª They say that it is no fun â™ª

â™ª But on that glass dick
shall I sucky â™ª

â™ª Sucky, sucky, sucky
till the crack is gone â™ª

â™ª Now we should
legalize it â™ª

â™ª Legalize it â™ª

â™ª Set the people free â™ª

â™ª And legalize â™ª

â™ª We should legalize crack â™ª

smoke it all... â™ª
