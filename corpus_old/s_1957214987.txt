<i>NORAD, this is ISS.</i>

<i>We just had a close
encounter with a UAP.</i>

<i>Any information on this?</i>

of our satellites.</i>

<i>I'm forwarding
this inquiry to NASA.</i>

<i>This is
Dr. Linda Murphy of Langley.</i>

by a rogue satellite.</i>

<i>Do you guys have
anything in that sector?</i>

That's a negative, NORAD.

We have no authorized air
traffic in that quadrant.

You kids are always
monkeying around with something.

Are you calling
to reprimand me

for breaking some
Bunsen burners?

Or is there another reason that
Homeland Security is calling?

Oh. No.
What's your thought on this?

Hard to say.
It has no organic shape to it.

So it ain't a meteor?

Unlikely.

Possibly a satellite.

What's the rate of descent?

It's falling at
28,000 feet per second.

28,000?

ISS has visual contact.

on our starboard side.</i>

<i>Nearly took us out.</i>

<i>Detected possible
signs of life.</i>

<i>We managed to get
one picture of the object</i>

<i>before it escaped our range.</i>

<i>Transmitting to you now.</i>

15 seconds!

Stand by.


Pull it up.

Whoa.

Dr. Reynolds?

Gotta call you back!


[coyote howls]

[ape shouts, banging]

[banging continues]

[ape screeches]

A pleasure,
as always, Dr. Murphy.

But what may I ask
is so important

you called an emergency
meeting at this hour?

More unidentified
flying objects?

Not unidentified, sir.

It's the "Elbe".

You can't be serious.

It's the Elbe.

Dr. Murphy, this is classified.

It just crashed in South-
Central Chavez county,

New Mexico, sir.

It's not classified any longer.

Chavez County. That's somewhere
near Roswell, right?

What the hell
is the Elbe, Linda?

A secret joint U.S.-Soviet
deep space probe

launched June 17th, 1985.

Hold on. But we weren't
conducting any joint missions

with the Soviets
back in the '80s.

That's why it's secret.

April 25th, 1945, the day
Soviet and American troops

met at Elbe River, Germany,

an important step
toward ending the war.

I'm familiar with that little
bit of history there, kiddo.

Well, Bush Jr.
and Putin felt nostalgic.

Yeah. They determined a joint
mission into deep space.

If successful,
it would end the Cold War

and significantly boost
the economies of both countries.

And success meaning?

Contact with alien lifeforms.

So I'm gonna presume
that this mission failed.

Naturally. We lost contact with
the Elbe August 12th, 2007.

And contact with the ship
was never reestablished?

Not until today.

Get down there and
retrieve our property, Murphy.

There's not a moment to lose.

Co-property, sir.

Surely, the Russians will have
something to say about this.

Well, that's why time
is of the essence.

I want you to use whatever
force is necessary

and report immediately on
the state of the occupant, okay?

Occupant?

A chimpanzee,
certainly deceased,

although we should
proceed with caution.

Everything's a day late
and a dollar short.

â™ª

Damn! I love the
rumble of a Humvee!

Dr. Reynolds?

Approaching the crash site,
Linda. You ready?

Since when do you do field work?

It's a hell of a lot better

than being stuck behind
a desk in the office.

Listen, kiddo, we've
known each other a long time.

I remember when
your daddy first brought you

to the Kennedy Space Center.

You crawled over that console,
started pushing buttons

and damn near started
World War III.

I was... curious.

You were impulsive!

Now when we get there,

you let us secure that perimeter
before you go charging in.

You got me?
Yes, sir!

15 seconds!

Copy that.

Showtime.

Roll up!

You'll be able to see
everything on your laptop.

Just don't post it
on stinkin' YouTube.

Can I livestream?

Hell, no.
This ain't a how-to video.

Copy that.

Do we really need
this much firepower?

When Russia's involved,
better safe than sorry.

Move out!

I'll be on the radio.
Just keep your ears open.

You catching this, Linda?

I see it.

You thinking reentry damage?

Our data shows
both chutes deployed.

Landing on sand wouldn't have
caused that kind of damage.

Get me closer.

Let's get a little closer.
Let's get inside.

The ship wasn't banged in.
It was banged out.

Signs of a struggle.

Where's the pilot?

Don't touch it!

It could be toxic,
possibly contagious!

Dr. Reynolds, I suggest you pull
back until we can determine...

Hold on a second, Linda!


Did you hear that?

Reynolds, pull your
team back, now!

Copy that!

We'll hazmat up and come back.

Roger that.

Back to the Humvees!


[growling continues]

What the hell was that?

Sounded like a lion.

Cut the damn chatter!

I've lost visual.


Holy hell!

What the hell?

Open fire!
Open fire!

[screeching, gunfire]

<i>Retreat! Retreat!</i>

No!

[gunfire continues]

[animal screeches]


I'm on my way!

[gun clicks]

Long time, Murphy.

Eva?

Eva Kuleshov?

I was hoping you'd remember.

How could I forget?

Well, there was a lot
of vodka flowing at Oxford.

Let's tend to that head, huh?
Can I get first aid here?

I'm fine.

Where's Under Secretary
Reynolds?

Who?
Under Secretary Reynolds!

I thought he might still...
Linda!

I'm sorry.

Your comrades fought bravely.

How one fights
is just as important

as the result that it yields.

We're done. Thank you.

Still quoting Lenin?

"Star Trek".

I read you
became a paleontologist

working for the State?

And an astrophysicist
like yourself.

It's good to see you, Murphy,
even under the circumstances.

What attacked us?

It was something quite
extraordinary.

Think you might recognize it.

That's not Abraham.

The creature we saw out there

was 15 feet tall,
over five times...

Six times his original size.

But how?

If this was the Cold War,
I'd have to say, "I'm sorry.

That was hallucination brought
on by your head injury."

I know what I saw.

Luckily, our superiors
are eager to continue

our secret Russo-American union.

The capsule was covered in it.

It is definitely not
of terrestrial origin.

Fantastic!

And the fact that it seems
to have survived

not only exposure to space,
but the intense heat

of reentry makes it
quite the interesting

alien substance indeed.

Do you believe it has something
to do with Abraham's growth?

Inconclusive.

We need to conduct
further testing

in a proper laboratory setting.

Where? Moscow?

No. It appears
we'll be returning

to the scene of the crime.

We're taking Abraham
back to Langley.

[coyote howls]

[animal howling]

Black, as I recall?

Black.

Like the heart of
the space program.

<i>Spasiba.</i>

<i>Pozhaluysta.</i>

Surely, the exploration
of deep space

in order to make contact with
alien life form is a noble...

Noble?

Well-trained, aren't they?

We Russians know how
to control our emotions.

Like at Oxford?

<i>TouchÃ©.</i>

Is it my imagination or
is he already getting bigger?

Our latest readings indicate
he is 1.5 meters greater

in length then
when first captured.

It's terrible,
what he's been subjected to.

This never should have happened.

But at least he's home now.

I'm sure you'll take
good care of him.

I'll do my best.

[man] Doctor! Come quick!
[alarm blares]

He's broken the restraints!
[beeping]

What's happened?

He's broken loose!

Use the gas.
Do it now!

I can't!
He broke it!

Smart monkey.
Damn it, get out of here!

[speaking Russian]


Go, go, go!
Secure the area!

Doctor, we have orders
to shoot the beast

if he tries to exit the lab!

Wait! No!

That glass is transparent
armor three feet thick!

You can fire
a howitzer directly at it,

it wouldn't make a difference!

We have armor-piercing shells.

Prepare to fire!
No!

Take aim!
No, don't!

Please!
Get out of the way!

Linda!
Put in the code!

I got it!

I have a shot!

Wait! Hold your fire!

It's working!

The gas is working!
He is sedated!

It is under control!
This isn't necessary!

Eva, put your gun down!
Put your guns down!

Was she out of line? Yes.

But General, you have
to understand,

she grew up with that ape.

I don't care!
Besides, my troops were

held up at gun point
by that commie!

And Dr. Murphy was
on her side?

Dr. Murphy is on our side.

And Eva is a scientist,
not a soldier.

Those two seem unusually chummy.

They're old friends, General,

and they've been at
this since time began.

But can they be trusted?

After all, one is a bleeding
heart animal rights activist

and the other's
a coldblooded Russkie!

I trust Linda.

Let's just hope
she doesn't let her emotions

cloud her judgment.

[speaking Russian] These are most disturbing developments,
Comrade Kuleshov.

Yes, First Secretary.

And the alien substance?

I assume you have more data
on its connection

to the simian's continued growth?

More testing is needed, First Secretary.

Well, Comrade Kuleshov,
you are now in the land of the heathen.

Radicalism runs rampant.

Yes, First Secretary.

For your sake...

I strongly suggest that
you engage in some.

Immediately.

â™ª

<i>Vector seven bravo two.</i>

Vector seven bravo two.

<i>You ready to give us a report
there, McDaniels?</i>

Yeah, my bladder's full,
but it's calm.

<i>Oh, yeah? Sounds like you're
having a busy night there.</i>

Yeah, it's pretty chilly,
it's pretty nice.

All by myself and quiet.
I'm gonna check this thing out.

<i>You sure that's a good idea?</i>

How the hell did a monkey
survive in this?

<i>I don't know, McDaniels,
why don't you tell us?</i>

<i>Sounds like you're ready
to camp out in that capsule.</i>

I don't think there's enough
room for me to take a shit.

<i>Well, don't get
too comfortable.</i>

Man, this is crazy!



[animal roaring]

Oh, shit!

There's something...

There's something huge
outside the capsule.

[growls, roars]



<i>McDaniels,
you okay over there?</i>

<i>You sound like
you pissed yourself.</i>

Yeah, I'm fine.

<i>You sure about that?</i>

Yeah, I think so.



What was that, Eagle Eye?

Come again!

Crap.

What happened?

Eagle Eye reports something
strange from the crash site.

Then the line just went dead.

Try him again.

Surveillance cameras?

Of course.
Oh, yeah.

All right, look. It's been
this way the last few minutes.

We got the report just...
right before this came in.

Okay.

Play it back!

There!

They saw something
out to the west!

Yes!

Something that knocked out
the video feed.

But what?
EMP?

Right.
The live feed came back on!

I got five, four, three...

Stop! What is that?

Oh, shit.

Whoa.

Does that look
like a tail to you?

Possibly, or just a glitch
caused by interference.

No, no, no.

A glitch?
That's organic!

A tail?
Reptilian.

I don't know what kind of
reptiles you're playing with.

I've never seen a reptile
with a tail that size!

Get me a high-resolution copy,
stills and slo-mo.

All right.
I got you, boss.

Let's not jump to conclusions!

I'm not jumping.
I'm hypothesizing.

That there's another
mutation out there?

The MP radioed that there
was something giant.

How do we know that there
weren't traces of that substance

left on the desert floor?

It's possible.

We gotta make certain.

Something killed those men,

something with enough energy
to black out all communications

until it was well out of range.

I'm going out there.

Stop! I'll go.
It was my team.

It was my responsibility.
Stay.

My whole life has been
in pursuit of first contact.

I'd hoped it would
manifest otherwise.

But if it is in the form
of a virulent strain,

it must be fully contained.

What about Abraham?

If he tries another breakout?

Our latest measurements show
that his growth has slowed.

Plus, he's in a bunker
that can withstand

a direct hit from
a hydrogen bomb.

Still, we should
boost his sedation.

Agreed.

â™ª

The wind sweeps
this desert hourly.

I don't know
why we're bothering.

Keep on it.

I got a feeling.

You know, feelings
put people out of business.

That's how
I lost my ex.

Zip it and keep scanning.

At least I know how to
wear a harness, honey.

I like it this way.

Over here.

Oh, God!

This isn't from the crash.

Look at the bones.
They're shorn off.

Oh, God.

Something else
happened to this man.

<i>Murphy? Status update.</i>

Yes, sir.
We're on-site now.

<i>And?</i>

Small traces of substance
have been recovered.

Damn it!
I expected as much.

This is exactly why
I wanted you

to investigate alone
without them.

<i>They bungled it!</i>

Couldn't even properly
contain the most

significant find
of the 20th century.

By them, do you man
our Russian partners?

<i>Partners?
They were never partners,</i>

not even during World War II

when they were
supposedly allies.

They were never partners!

They took Berlin, sir.

<i>A publicity stunt!</i>

A billion killed,
they were allowed

to piss on Hitler's grave first.

But Patton had it right.
They were never to be trusted.

But this space program
was Bush and Putin's dream,

<i>making first contact together.</i>

Murphy, when is that innocent
bubble of yours gonna burst?

This program was
a disaster from the start

and it's only getting worse.

Sir?

We just had a report of
unidentified light patterns

moving really fast eastbound.

<i>Sir?</i>

I'm gonna send you
some coordinates.

<i>Can you pass by
as you head back to Langley?</i>

<i>Of course.</i>
Good deal.

Detour.

Great. Awesome.

What is it now,
Comrade Eisenstein?

Am I ever allowed to get
more than a moment of rest?

But it's dying, Comrade Doctor.

What is?
The alien matter.

You see?

Why?

It appears that any exposure
in our environment

eventually causes
irreversible cellular breakdown.

Every sample we've acquired is
diminishing along these lines.

What is the timeline?

I estimate total cellular
breakdown within three hours.

Is that a conservative estimate?

It is.

[speaks Russian]

And in Abraham?

What?

The substance is in
the simian's bloodstream, idiot!

Is he still active?

The last blood test taken

was just after
his attempted breakout.

We didn't dare pull
another sample

after Dr. Murphy
calmed him down.

But, fortunately,
he injured his hand

and left a nice sample
smeared on the chamber floor.

Result?

Diminishment, Comrade Doctor.
Reduced cellular activity.

Perhaps this accounts for
his lower rate of growth.

But no petrification?

No.

That means the alien substance

can still survive
within Abraham.

Perhaps an organic host
preserves substance

better than
any inorganic system.

But they're still dying.

Can they be replenished?

Comrade Doctor?

The simian's life was
over effectively the moment

he was entered in the program
thirty years ago.

His life is expendable.

Meanwhile, our first
contact with an alien life form

is being marginalized to
the point of annihilation.

We cannot allow this to happen.

The substance must be preserved.

Prepare to release
the gas in Bunker 6.

Do it quickly.

I want you to take every
viable sample

and load it into a syringe.

We're going to inject
the alien matter into Abraham.

But, Comrade Doctor,

we don't know how
it will affect the beast.

Are you prepared to allow
for the extermination

of an entire alien species
for the sake of one damned ape?

No, Comrade Doctor.

Well then, you have
your orders.

â™ª

How we doing?

We're two clicks away from
the coordinates he set.

What are we looking for?

That!

Holy shit!

The train...

It's heading straight
towards it!

This is a COMSEC priority!
Patch me into the DOT, ASAP!

This is nothing to do with us.

This is Dr. Linda Murphy

of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration!

You have a passenger train
heading straight towards...

Hello? Hello?

Something's interfering!

The radio's dead!
We gotta pull over!

Damn it!
Our nav's out too!

Is that engineer blind?

Brake, you son of a bitch!
Brake!


our only way forward.

We're gonna have
to proceed on foot.

You're joking, right?

I didn't prepare for hiking.

Where are you going?

You said we have
to take it on foot.

Let's go!

[speaking Russian]
Yes, First Secretary.

The alien life form is
secure inside its host.

I'll keep you informed.


Yes, Eisenstein?

Excuse me, Doctor.

<i>We've lost contact with
Dr. Murphy and her team.</i>

<i>A few miles before reaching the
target, their signal cut out.</i>

How long?

<i>We heard nothing
for a half hour.</i>

<i>What's the target, doctor?</i>

Unknown.

<i>Well, you'll be ready.</i>

<i>This baby's got
16 Hellfire missiles</i>

<i>with thermobaric warheads,
10 Hydra rockets,</i>

<i>and a 30mm chain gun
to bust the tables.</i>

Yes, but can it shoot?

<i>That's my bird you're piloting.
It'll get the job done.</i>

<i>Sensors got something.</i>

I see it.

<i>Turn .65 degrees.</i>

That's it.
We are totally lost.

Try the radio again.

And I told you, doctor.
It's fried.

Whatever energy that
creature was emitting

burned it along with every
communicator we have.

That's great.

You know, we're just
gonna die out here.

That's marvelous.

Well, that's the spirit, troop.

If at first you don't succeed,
forget about it!

Yeah, that's it.

We gotta keep moving.

Get to civilization and
let the authorities know

what they're dealing with.

Wait, wait, wait.

[helicopter rotors]

You were saying?

You hear that?

Baker to Able.
Do you copy?

<i>They're not responding.
Is it them?</i>

Well, I doubt that anyone would
be picnicking out here.

Baker to Able.
Do you copy?

Linda, it's Eva!

Ah, finally!

They're coming in.

See? We're good!
We're safe!

Eyes are peeled.

<i>For what? Ain't nothing out
here but lizards and beach.</i>

You know, maybe
you're right.

I'm thinking about
this all wrong.

It's my fault.

Power of psychological thinking.


Is that an earthquake?

No.

Run!
Linda! Linda!


How's that for a target?

<i>Jesus.</i>

Myers, get down!


I'm opening fire!

C'mere.

Who do you think's flying
that helicopter?

Someone with a lot of balls.

I'm coming around
for another pass!

It's time for the chain gun.


<i>That ain't doing squat!
That armor's too thick!</i>

Ah!

It's coming.

Time to show this lizard
you don't mess with a Russian.

I'm firing more rockets!


<i>That thing's too close,
you might hit the team!</i>

They're dead if I don't fire!
I'm firing now!

<i>Knock, knock.
The reptile's gone.</i>

He's underground.

Anyone home?

It's Eva.

A few minutes more
and I was gonna leave.

Was that you flying?

That was some
fancy flying back there.

We lost Myers.

I know. I saw.

That creature...

Gila Monster,
no doubt about it.

The image on the video was...

Its tail, yes,
I can see that now, but how?

The desert is its home.

Only an alien element could have
caused such a massive mutation.

We found remnants
of it at the site, clearly.

Right.

The creature made contact.
It's been growing ever since.

Right. You ready to go
back to work

or is that your
new lab down there?

[Abraham roaring]
[alarm blaring]

He's gotten loose!

Brace the door!

He's trying to get out!



Ah!

Close the door!
Close the door!

No!


I've already notified
Washington and the Kremlin.

This lizard won't
remain hidden for long.

But how to destroy it?

The strikes you made
only seemed to slow him.

Yes.

Obviously, much
higher concentration

of firepower will be necessary.

<i>This is Langley
for Dr. Murphy.</i>

It's the lab.

<i>Linda, he's got loose.
We couldn't stop him.</i>

Abraham's escaped.

Abraham's escaped!

What?

There's no way.

[speaks Russian]

I don't understand.

His growth rate had slowed.

How could he grow three times
his size so quickly?

I want to see
the surveillance video.

Freeze it.

What about the cameras in
the bunker before the breakout?

Maybe it has some clue.

Unfortunately, the simian
disabled the surveillance camera

shortly before we received
your distress call.

He's changed, but how?

What caused it?

Abraham's tracker!

Where is he heading now?

Moving fast. Looks like
he's heading north towards...

Seaford? I don't know.

Any reports
of further destruction?

in the Blue Ridge Mountains,

but it's a ideal hiding
place for an ape.

A creature that size
doesn't just disappear.

People will think that
it's your American Bigfoot.

It's just a matter of time.

There are rumors
he has destroyed

your new Extraterrestrial
Defense Initiative.

But nobody here will confirm it.

How do you know about EDI?
That's classified.

Your new Star Wars program?
Please.

Haven't you learned
this yet about us Russians?

We know things about
you people before you do.

[alarm ringing]

The signal's gone dead.

What was his last location?

I don't know,
looks like Beaverton.

Huh.

You know it?

Yeah, I know it.

Went fishing there
when I was growing up.

We need to get to Washington.

I think I should...

Yes, Jones?

Jones, get your coat.

Fine, fine.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

Coming!




We just got word!

Abraham was spotted three miles
east of Rollins Fork!

We know, but that
was two hours ago.

No eyes yet.

Abraham ripped out his GPS.

Smart monkey!

How can you lose giant ape?

He hasn't hit any
major population centers

and appears to be hiding.

Nonsense!
It's a monkey!

With the ability to comprehend
complex thoughts.

What about that lizard?

Underground. No chip.

You have big problem in America.

Lizards can swim,
First Secretary.

Russia can soon have
the same problem.

Abraham must be getting bigger.

How?

The man behind Project Elbe
is your father, right?

He has nothing to do with this.

Well, he may be able to give
us some answers we need.

Like what?

Like why Abraham is still
alive after all this time?

Why is he behaving
so strategically?

In case you don't
remember, he was dismissed

from the program
because of Elbe.

I suggest you look
at the present for answers,

not the past.

I believe your emotions
are, uh...

adversely coloring your
conclusions, Dr. Murphy.

There's nothing
personal here, sir.

I haven't spoken to my father
in over 10 years.

You reported some kind
of glow for this creature.

Is that correct, Dr. Murphy?

Yes.

But your super chimp...

Abraham.
Abraham, yeah.

He didn't show any glow.

No, sir, not since last contact.

Well, what do you think
accounts for this discrepancy?

We believe Abraham's
ingestion of the substance

was a gradual
microparticulate intake...

Uh-huh.
Much like a gas.

Okay.

It slowly penetrated the capsule

and mixed with the oxygen
Abraham was breathing.

Whereas the Gila
monster may have ingested

the substance directly.

This is all very
interesting, doctors.

I have only one question.

Where exactly are these
two freaks of nature now?

Let me introduce
General Delaney, doctors,

taking command for
the late General Reynolds.

Dr. Murphy, I understand you and
my predecessor were very close.

You have my sympathies,
but you must appreciate

that this is not a time
for emotional outcries.

I didn't believe
I was engaging in any.

The safety of this great nation

must take precedence
over any scientific debate.

Debate over what?

Both monsters must be
destroyed immediately.

Now wait a minute!
Abraham...

Abraham. You see?

You're talking like that ape
is your pet hamster!

Look, this is
all academic, girls.

Girls?

The orders have been given.
Shoot to kill.

Is this true, sir?

Abraham is part of
the space program!

For all intents and purposes,
he is a test pilot.

You don't have to kill him!

We can figure out what's wrong,
fix this disease.

General Delaney's right.

We can't afford
any more casualties.

And certainly not
a nationwide panic!

Your job now is
to track these beasts.

Locate them and
let the military do the rest!

Is that clear?

Clear, sir.

You were saying, General?

I was saying I have
six armored divisions

massing on the
West Virginia border.

As soon as that salamander
shows his skin, he's guacamole!

I was here, you know,
when I was a child.

I didn't.

I remember you
speaking of your father,

the great Noel Murphy.

Hah. Great.

He is, after all, the father
of modern astrophysics.

He should have been
father to his children.

Genius takes precedence.
at times, even over life.

Star Trek?

Lenin.

You clearly admired the man.

You keep his photograph.

You followed in his footsteps.

I wanted his approval,

but even then, I knew
his methods were unethical.

And that the ends
didn't justify the means.

And all the animals forced
into the space program.

Laika, Miss Baker

and all of the rabbits,
dogs, mice...

and chimps all forcibly
shot into space

for the benefit of mankind
were a terrible mistake

borne out of ambition

and ignorance... and that
it would never happen again.

My father lied to me,

the great man,

said that this time
it would be different.

That Abraham would be safe.

And how he would return a hero

and become
the most important ape...

important animal...
who ever lived.

But he has returned

and your father's prophecy
may very well come to pass.

Abraham was lost
in space for 30 years!

Can you imagine the toll
that has taken on his mind,

if he has any mind at all?

To speak nothing
of this mutation which,

in all probability,
will most likely kill him.

My father promised me...

no more animals would suffer

and I believed him!

So much so that I made Abraham
that very same promise!

It wasn't your fault, Milaya.

As children, we were taught

the individual is not important.

But what matters most
is service to the state.

So if one man matters not,
what chance had an animal?

I've learned a lot since then.

I'll be damned if all I do is
put a target on Abraham's back.

We must find him first and try
to arrest his growth.

Here.

We will, Milaya.

Okay.

I've enhanced
our Apache's thermal tracking

software with an algorithm
that can recognize

the alien cells that are active
within Abraham's biology.

But once located,
will he come quietly?

You're going to need
a bigger teddy bear.

I have the lab working up
a hyper tranquilizer.

The one we currently have
wouldn't put his leg to sleep.

I've got a plan
for a net

that can be jettisoned from
the belly of the Apache.

It requires explosives

and acts like an inverse reentry
parachute deployment system.

No rest for the weary, huh?
Just like Oxford.

I got a friend at JPL
working on the prototype.

But it's not gonna be
ready in over 24 hours.

What are you thinking, Milaya?

We're doing everything we can,
and on no sleep at that.

Are we?

We must be missing something.

What?

I don't know.

I mean, we've been so
focused on the creatures.

Maybe we should worry
about this green goo.

Let the military
worry about that.

[phone rings]

Hello?

When?

Check the news.

<i>All communications are down</i>

<i>for ten miles
surrounding Huntington</i>

<i>due to an unidentified
electrical disturbance.</i>

That's gotta be
that damn lizard.

Delaney will be diverting
all of his efforts

towards taking down
that Gila monster.

We might have a chance
to save Abraham.

Let's go.

I've got something...
faint, but it's there.

Bearing?

Eight-two-zero.

Copy.

There's no safe place
to pull over.

Find a clearing!
Anywhere!

Copy.

Up ahead, right over there.

He's up ahead, 50 meters.

Strange.

Blood.

No.

Unknown.

Hang on.

The cell count is diminishing.

It's the air, yes.

It kills the alien cells.

We made some
preliminary findings

while you were patrolling
the crash site.

Findings?

And then all hell broke loose.

What findings?

As I said, whatever
extraterrestrial component

is inherent in that material
is not viable in our atmosphere.

It needs a living host.

Living host?

What about the samples
back at the base?

They're all stable.

For a short time.

And then?

Total necrosis.

The blood's already
breaking down.

Abraham is going to die.

When were you going
to tell me this?

I wanted to, believe me.

But with the Gila surfacing
and racing to save you...

Oh, bullshit!

What else are you
not telling me?

Nothing.

That's not true.

Look me in the eye.

Ah...
No!

Look at me, Eva!

What the hell did you do?

Abraham.

You injected him, didn't you?

You injected him and then
erased the surveillance videos.

Abraham didn't destroy
the cameras back at the bunker.

You did! Why?

We were running out of time!

I did what was necessary
to keep the entity alive!

You sacrificed Abraham!

Sometimes sacrifices
are necessary, Milaya!

Lenin?

Me.

For all your education,
all your brilliance,

you haven't learned
anything at all.

Doctors, I'm Captain James Tsao,
Special Recon.

Is everything all right?

From Langley?

I remember you.

What are you doing here?

Same thing you are,
hunting that monkey.

We received a report
you'd set down.

We came to assist.

Thank you, but we don't
need your assistance.

As you can see,
what she means, Captain,

is that the area is clear.

This is a wild duck chase,
as you Americans say.

Goose, wild goose.

Sir?

Over here!

Looks like blood, sir.

I wouldn't.

There's a Gila monster
the size of a space shuttle

burrowing through West Virginia
because it touched that stuff.

Back off, Harker!

As you can see, Captain,
there's nothing here.

If he was here,
he's long gone now.

We appreciate your
medical advice, doctors.

But as for the target,
we'll see for ourselves.

If you'll excuse us.

Move out!

You're off my team.

It's here.
I can feel it.

How does an ape get to be
the size of a blimp, Cap?

That's not
your concern, soldier.

Yeah, you're right.

It doesn't matter how
as long as it burns.

Abraham?

Target located.

Sir?
What if it's the girls?

Collateral damage.

[grenade explodes]

Got him! Cover our flank!
Come on!

Let's get it together.
We got a date with...



Abraham!


<i>This is a critical situation.</i>

<i>Do you understand what will
happen if we don't stop this?</i>

And why didn't
you tranquilize him?

Dr. Kuleshov
had the tranquilizer,

as I already explained.

We split up.

I presume she broke away
to pursue the Gila monster.

But I haven't been
able to reach her.

This is why girls
should not be in combat!

Call me girl one more time!

People, this is the Pentagon!

If you want to fight,
go to Capitol Hill.

Now where is Dr. Kuleshov?

Like I said,
I lost contact with her.

After the Special Forces
team was routed.

You mean slaughtered!

Let's not lose
the thread here.

Kuleshov is officially missing

and our Apache helicopter's
not been found.

Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

No, sir.

Either she's... KIA...

Or she doesn't want
to be found.

<i>Dr. Kuleshov is not
important right now.</i>

<i>If she is dead,
then she died for the cause.</i>

<i>We should focus
on task at hand.</i>

<i>Where is this chimp?</i>

I conducted a thorough sweep
of the immediate area

after I was picked up.

No sign.

And the giant lizard?

Went underground after
it entered West Virginia.

Sure does seem like the lizard
is going after the ape.

Looking for a fight!

<i>Maybe that's for the best.</i>

<i>After all, they can do
what you could not:</i>

<i>kill each other.</i>

Maybe on your soil, Comrade.

Those two beasts
start going at it,

we're going to pay the price.

I don't believe they're being
led towards each other.

They're not natural enemies.

And you know this because
you've worked

with giant, unearthly
beasts before?

Marcos, assemble your team.

Let's try and box these
MFA fighters

into some remote area
in Shenandoah Park.

Minimize the damage that way.

Do what we must to neutralize
the Gila monster,

but prioritize
Abraham's capture.

Here we go.

It is his capture
that is essential...

or the horror we're facing now
will only just be the beginning.


My God.

Jones, get over here!

What do you want?

We've always known that
the Gila monster emits

an intense cosmic glow

stemming from its exposure
to the alien substance.

Not... Although naked
to the visible eye,

the same emittance is
detectable within Abraham,

albeit at much lower levels.

And that this emittance
is internal,

emerging from the bodies of the
animals in question, correct?

Correct.
Incorrect.

Check this.

Every occurrence from
the Gila monster's attack

on the train to my last
encounter with Abraham.

I don't understand.
What am I looking at?

I upgraded our
sky mapping system

based on the cellular pattern
of the alien substance.

That seems like an excessive
amount of work.

I suspected something.

Look, right here.

These are distinct beams
of extraterrestrial energy,

definitely incoming.

They were there all along.
We just couldn't see them.

Wait, but these are going
from New Mexico to Virginia.

Yeah, confirming our theory

that the quakes there
were Gila-monster-related.

So you're saying that the...

the glow contains
the same elemental properties

as the Gila monster...

...and the green substance.
And our readings off Abraham?

Yes.

But what are they?

I believe
it's a guidance system.

A what?

Abraham and the Gila monster

are being directed
via remote control.

You've lost your mind.
It's happened. It's official.

It's all right there.
I'm 100% certain.

Yeah, you've lost your mind.

Look!

The green substance is
in their blood stream.

And if the aliens can
control that,

they can control
their every move.

It's incredible.

Okay. Where and by what?

I ordered Hubble
to provide visuals

detailing point of origin.

We should get them shortly.

But the last beam originated
from this location.

The Andromeda Galaxy.

2.5 million light years away,

and the Milky Way's
closest neighbor.

[phone rings]

Hello?

Copy.

Thank you.

From Hubble.

Images coming in.

Put it up on the big screen.

Good God!

How do we defend against this?

EDI.

The Extraterrestrial
Defense Initiative

was created for just such
a purpose, First Secretary.

However, the EDI Operations
Center was destroyed

when Abraham escaped
from Langley.

My understanding
it was under repair.

Not until further
appropriations are approved.

Calm down, General.

More politics?
<i>This is unacceptable.</i>

<i>I need you to do something,
not just sit there.</i>

So we're looking at
two remote-controlled monsters

guided by an alien mothership
headed for earth?

No.

The Gila monster is
definitely being controlled,

but Abraham's signal is weak.

I think he's resisting control.

Irregardless,
this is war, gentlemen!

Intergalactic combat!

Careful, General.

I do believe you're drooling.

Dad?

What are you doing here?

As I said earlier, doctor,

reinforcements are needed,
particularly now.

Well, hello, my daughter.

Nothing to say?

I'm working on it.

Put aside your differences.
We need to get to work.

We need to know what
the next move is gonna be.

We can't afford
any more surprises.

Yes, sir.

Dr. Noah Murphy and I
will head back to Langley now.

I don't need your help.

Self-sufficiency.

I am so proud of you.

You don't have the right.

Indeed, I failed you,
Linda, and I am sorry.

And to add insult to injury,
Elbe was an embarrassment.

A mission to have first contact

that misses is like a boomerang
that just never comes back.

This one did.

Eh, a little too late.

The powers that be don't share
the patience of scientists.

Then you ran away
from everything.

Listen, Linda,
you and your mother

were much better off without me.

Now, from
an empirical perspective,

you have to agree with me.

I'm not sure I concur
with your findings, doctor.

Be that as it may,

what we have on our hands now

supersedes any
of our personal issues.

I'm here at the request
of the government

to do whatever I can to help.

Look, your work
on cellular tracking

is groundbreaking, Linda.

At least it gives us
a fighting chance.

The question is how do we use
this information against them?

I believe if they're
being controlled by a signal,

that that signal
can be interrupted.

Are you saying,
cut the transmission

and render them rudderless?

Of course!

That's to assume they have
no will of their own.

I believe Abraham does.

He's not acting with malice.

He only strikes when provoked.

Regardless, cutting
the cable is key.

I believe it's possible
to shoot a disruptive pulse

and cut right through
the alien beams.

A bio-electric counter-measure.

Just a question of time.

Time we don't have.

Where are
the targets currently headed?

They appear
to be converging, sir.

Where?

Come on, man, where?

I don't know!
Washington, D.C.

That certainly
doesn't help matters.

But why?

Up until this point, they've
been moving independently.

Possibly, but whomever
is controlling them,

the target makes
strategic sense.

With the Capitol in shambles,

the country tumbles
into chaos...

Possibly the world following.

I don't believe
Abraham is a drone.

You've always had a special
deep affection for that simian.

Yeah, maybe I should never
have brought you here.

If you hadn't, I would have
never became a scientist.

And for that,
I will always be grateful.

But Abraham, he is not
like that Gila monster.

He wasn't exposed to the alien
toxins in the same manner.

But those toxins
were also injected

directly into him
by your Russian partner.

She's not my partner!

Nevertheless, he now has
more toxins, as you say,

within his system,

toxins that my make him more
susceptible to alien command.

I believe that
his signal is weaker.

Abraham is resisting control.

You mean, you hope,

and hope, Linda,
is not a strategy.

Sometimes hope
is the only strategy.


Doctors?

I think we've got a problem.

ISS just sent us this video.

What were you saying
about hope?

<i>Did anyone else just see that?</i>

<i>My God, it's really happening!</i>

<i>Call the Pentagon, now!</i>

<i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>You must contain this.</i>

What's going on?

High alert.

Abraham?

We're dealing
with spaceships now.

Hovering over
the Pacific Islands.

They're heading towards D.C.

Abraham, the Gila monster,

the ship, all of them,

they're heading towards D.C.

And you know this because?

There's no question.

And the alien mothership
is right behind them.

Based on our calculations,

they'll all be upon
the city in six hours.

Attacking the Capitol!

No.

Disrupting the chain of command,

giving them an opportunity
to organize a strike force.

And demoralize the nation.

<i>I don't think propaganda is
part of alien agenda, General.</i>

We will unleash
the unholy hell

from the U.S. fighting force!

Your tank was wiped out
in one swift swoop, General.

Tanks are Tinker Toys!

Our new supersonic
cruise missiles

will punch enough holes
in those suckers,

they'll wish they never
came to this planet!

Gentlemen?

They're both from this planet!

The truth, sir, is we don't
know what Abraham will do.

He may not be under
total control of the aliens.

We have to assume the worst.

<i>What else can we do to
prevent destruction of city?</i>

We've worked up
a bio-electric formula

that could interrupt
the alien transmissions

that control the creatures.

I'm requesting permission
to install the transmitter

on top of
the Washington Monument.

That's great!
See to it.

There's no time to lose.

Let's do it.

It's the best chance
we've got.

Let's just hope it works.

He might be a genius.

the transmitter has been</i>

<i>attached to the monument.</i>

<i>The signal will begin
broadcasting shortly.</i>

[sirens blaring]

Sir, we have a visual
on the target!

Fire!

Give that monkey
all you got right now!

Over there!
Left quadrant!

Okay, thank you.

It's within the city limits.

How long before we transmit?

30 seconds.

You know, I used to dream
of living in a world

where you touch the stars and
hold hands with those beyond,

And I...

I dream of you,

not my adopted daughter,

my own flesh and blood
beside me.

You got part of it right, Dad,

maybe the most important part.

Dr. Murphy!

Yes?
Yes?

Status, status?

The transmitter
is up and running.

Eisenstein, how much longer

until they're free
from alien control?

I estimate the alien's beam
is at 11...

no, 10% strength
over Abraham.

He is almost free already.

Abraham's still
holding about 10%.

Excellent.

It's working, Dad.
You did it.

Well, we'll see, we'll see.

What's the timetable?

It's hard to say.

If Abraham is in more
possession of his faculties,

we might be able
to free him sooner.

Eisenstein says
we're at eight percent now.

Almost there...

What about the Gila monster?

He's resisting.

The transmitter must not be
able to reach him underground.

Eisenstein,
what's the percentage?

Alien control
of Gila monster

is holding at 90%.

90%? That much?

Damn it!

Patience, Linda, patience.
Give it time.

That's one luxury
we can't afford.

Eisenstein, please tell me
you know where this thing is.

Hard to say,
his signal is weak.

The Gila's signal has spiked!
It's about to emerge!

<i>Excuse me?
Did I hear that right?</i>

She said the Gila...
is about to emerge.

Where?


[Gila monster roaring]


Gentlemen...

We have a new target.

I don't see Abraham!

<i>Eisenstein,
what's Abraham's status?</i>

Abraham is completely
free from control!

But without alien signal,
his location is unclear.

Abraham is free!

But he must have run away.
We should do the same.

Linda, you don't
need to be here.

You're not a soldier.

Damn right. Come on!

No.

I'm a scientist,
just like my father.

Real cute, but now's
not the time. Come on.

Linda, let's get out of...

Wait a minute, do you hear that?

[Abraham growls]

[Abraham screeches]

There he is!
Hit that ape!

No! Don't shoot him!

Stop! Abraham is no longer
under alien control!

Hold your fire on the monument!

Abraham is not a threat!

I repeat, Abraham
is not a threat!

And we're making sure
of that, baby doll!


Asshole.

Fire!

Our countermeasure's
are over there.

That cowboy's liable
to bungle the whole show.

Come on!
Knock that bastard down!

Come on!
Blow him to smithereens, I say!

I'll be dipped in pig shit!

<i>I have bad news...</i>

<i>Alien beam has regained
control of Abraham.</i>

The longer the signal
is down,

the more mindless and
destructive he will become.

Without the signal, we lose
the only chance we still had.

Tell me there's
another transmitter,

prototype, anything!

A prototype, yes,

but it's incomplete and
on the other side of D.C.

It's too dangerous.

It looks like I failed
you again, daughter.

<i>Sir, we've lost
General Delaney.</i>

<i>And the transmitter is down.</i>

<i>What are your orders?</i>

<i>What else can do to prevent
destruction of city?</i>

We can't save the city.

Patch me through to Dr. Murphy.

<i>It's over. Get out of DC
while you still can.</i>

<i>We're gonna burn the whole
place to the ground.</i>

The hell with that!

Now's not the time to give up.

Grab your car.
Meet me out front.

What?

We're going after that device.

Have you lost your mind?

Do you not see what's
happening out there?

We're toast!
We're going after that device!

Now, Jones, go!

Dad?

The transmitter
is in a black box

in a white van
with a beacon

at the top of the City Center
parking structure.

You can find it!
It's there!

Okay.

Then we got a chance.

Yes.
Let's go.

Wait! What are you doing?

I'm getting you to safety.

I'm not leaving you up here.

Linda, look around.

Inside, outside,
the danger's everywhere.

I belong here.

This is the best vantage
point in the city.

I can give you live updates
on the location

of the Gila monster and Abraham.

Go. Get the job done.

I'll be with you the whole way.

Get in the car.

Hit it!

You got it, boss.

Whoa.

Easy there, Bullitt.

I've been dying to do this.

Do what?

Drive like a maniac
with complete and utter

disregard for all authority.

Don't get cocky.

The Gila monster still has the
authority until we cut his cord.

Good thing they've already
evacuated this place.


Isn't that
always how it goes?

Politicians go first
in their helicopters

while they leave
the rest of us here to fry.

She's doing what?
Get me Murphy!

<i>What are you doing to help
contain this monster?</i>

<i>You should be using
nuclear weapons.</i>

Speak of the devil.

Murphy, I understand you're on
some kind of suicide mission.

Explain.

Suicide is
not our intention, sir.

<i>A prototype of the device
my father created</i>

<i>to sever alien control
from the monsters</i>

is somewhere in a van.

Sounds pretty futile, Murphy.

Isn't there any other
course of action?

What's your father say?

<i>Dad, what's your take?</i>

cut the signal,</i>

<i>and the destruction stops.</i>

<i>It might stop
the alien ship, too.</i>

My father concurs.

<i>Murphy, you make a good point.</i>

[tires screeching]
The road!


He's right behind us.
Step on it!

Doing the best I can!

<i>Murphy!
Are you still there?</i>

For all intents and purposes.

<i>The device is
in an indestructible box.</i>

fitted with a tracking device.

It's our only hope
to gain the upper hand.

We have to find that device.

I like your spirit, Murphy.
Let's hope it's enough.

Do you need any support?

Troops or equipment?

Negative, sir.

I've got all the backup I need.

Get the job done,
and God be with you.

Now you sound
like my father, sir.

I'll take that as a compliment.

<i>Marcos out.</i>

Hang a right at the next light.

Right.
I said right!

Don't tell me where
to drive, by the way.

I know this town like
the back of my hand, okay?

All right, okay.

It's directly up ahead.

Park it... park it over there.

[Gila monster roaring]

Sure about that?

Nothing's sure
in science, Jones.

You know that...
until it's proven.

It's up there!
Probably near the roof!

Of course it is.
Great! Fantastic!

The Gila monster
is getting closer!

Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

There it is.

It's there!

How are we gonna get in?

Ah!

They make that look
so much easier in the movies.

Incomplete is right.

Where's the auxiliary
power source...

Damn it! Jones, see if the car
has a compression filter.

Wait a minute, got it!

<i>Hurry up, Murphy!
We don't have much time.</i>

Gunships are on standby.

Come on... come on!

Looks like it's still
functional.

Do you need that filter or not?

<i>Linda, you'll need to manually
bypass the motivator.</i>

<i>Only then will
the signal resume.</i>

<i>Is that the red
or the blue channel?</i>

This might take a minute.
I'll keep watch.

Did you know we have court side
seats to the end of the world?

[Sec.] <i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>Extraction point
is in opposite direction.</i>

<i>Where are you going?</i>

they can get in Washington.</i>

<i>Are you crazy?</i>

<i>This is not your fight, Eva.</i>


<i>is just as important
as the result it yields.</i>

<i>This is insubordination...</i>

I'm coming, Linda.
I'm coming.

Linda, you almost done?

Almost got it...

<i>We're running out of time.</i>

<i>I know you can do it, Linda.</i>

<i>I love you.</i>

All right.
Here goes nothing.

<i>The signal is on!</i>

<i>Abraham is regaining control!</i>

The Gila is holding.
And it's right on top of them.

[Gila shrieking]

Ah!

Son of a bitch.

[Abraham roaring]

Abraham!

Kick his ass!


No!

Linda!

It's Eva.

Please forgive me!

There's nothing to forgive.

I'm sorry, too.

You did what
you thought was right.

That's all I needed
to hear, Milaya.

[speaking Russian]
So long!

[speaking Russian]
Screw you, you son of a bitch!



[Gila suffering]

Damn it.

Tell the gunships they have
my permission to fire!

Linda, congratulations.

I understand you've
accomplished your mission.

No, wait,
I didn't do anything!

Abraham killed the Gila monster!

That's one down, one to go.

The gunships are en route
to take that monkey out.

So I suggest you get
your ass out of there.

No! You don't understand!

Abraham defeated the monster!

Wait! No!

Murphy.
Murphy, are you there?

Oh, God, no.

I'm sorry, Abraham.
I'm so sorry.

All air units.

This is National Security
Adviser Marcos, do not...

I repeat, do not fire
on the simian.

Copy sir, we're falling back.

Sir! ISS has just confirmed,

the alien spacecraft
has left our atmosphere.

Are you certain, doctor?

Well, according to our readings,

the alien spacecraft has left
the atmosphere

and is heading back
to whence it came.

With their tail between
their legs, no doubt.

General Delaney would
certainly be happy about that.

We will continue
tracking it, of course.

And the remote control
over the creatures?

The felled Gila monster is
creating no signs whatsoever.

Totally inactive.

Cool.
And the simian?

What's going on?
Where's Abraham?

Linda! Linda, easy, easy.
He's going to be okay.

He's going to be okay.

That's what you told me
when I was nine!

Now, now, now, now, look.

I learned my lesson.
No more lies, no more hiding.

Science smiles
only on the truth.

And truth is, you were right
about Abraham all along.

Multiple witnesses told me

that he took down that
Gila monster singlehandedly.

But... but why did you call off
the gunships

if you needed further
confirmation

of what I already told you?

Well, my dear,
I acted on something

I haven't considered
since I was a little boy.

And what's that?
Faith.

What about Abraham?

Where will he go now?

Doctor?

Well, we found a base
out near Santa Fe

we think would be the perfect
sanctuary for him...

For him to heal and for the two
of you to get reacquainted.

And, of course, it's the perfect
location for study.

Study?

What... What kind of study
and by whom?

By you alone.

You have total authority
on the matter if you want it.

And with a little assistance
from an old man,

if you'll have me.

Thanks, Dad.
I'd like that very much.


A hero's welcome.
