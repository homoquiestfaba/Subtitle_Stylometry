â™ª I'll see you in my dreams â™ª

How are you feeling now?

The same.

And the feelings of anxiety?

Dread?

The same.

All right. We'll give it a moment.

You said you could give me
something to help me relax.

I already have.

You have?

Sometimes the medication affects
the perception of time.

Things can become fluid.

I understand you lost your wife recently.

Vehicular misadventure.

Is that what triggered your attempt?

She was the pin holding
everything in place.

When she left, it all
just started to unravel.

How so?

It just revealed what was already there.

What had been there for a long time.

What had always been there.

It was too much. I had to get away.

From what?

I don't know.

A feeling.

A feeling of what?

I don't know. I don't remember.

Oh god.

You haven't been sleeping
since you came here.

I can't.

I'm afraid of where my
mind goes when I sleep.

A dream?

No.

It feels like a memory, but...

Where does it take you?

Where are we going?

There's a town.

A town?

Tell me.

No.

The medication will help.

Let it relax you.

Surrender to it.

No. I don't want to.

Yes...

Remembering will set you free.

No, I don't...

We'll go there together.

Follow the sound of my voice.

Follow the sound of my voice.

Do we have to leave now?

Follow the sound of my voice.

Now...

Tell me the dream.

Tell me the first thing you remember.

My father...

Waking me up.

It's time to go.

Where are we going?

We're going to the carnival.

It's so early.

Do we have to leave now?

Yes.

It's time.

Mother is still asleep.

She doesn't go with us.

And then we're on a train.

We're on a train for a long time.

Why is it so far?

The carnival is in another town.

We have to cross the border to get there.

What are we going to do at the carnival?

You'll see.

It's time...

Tell me about the town.

No. I don't want to go.

You're already on the train.

You have no choice.

Tell me about the town.

It's time.

Something about it feels familiar.

Like I've been here before.

Where's the carnival?

You'll see.

It revealed what was there...

What had always been there.

I see him everywhere.

It looks like there had
been some kind of carnival

or a street fair here at one time, but...

It's all falling apart...

and all the people are gone.

You'll see...

â™ª I'll see you in my dreams â™ª

There's a town...

Father's in a hurry for
us to get somewhere.

Where is he taking you?

There's a sideshow.

It's time...

Enjoy the show, kid.

â™ª I'll see you in my dreams â™ª

You're late.

The boy slowed me down. Always lingering.

That's to be expected. You
should have prepared better.

I'm sorry.

Well it doesn't really matter what I think.

They, on the other hand...

They were...

...grumbling.

So...

You ready?

What's going to happen to him?

It's a little late for that, isn't it?

What are you worried about? Look at him.

He's got the show.

The show will keep him occupied
for the rest of his life.

We better not keep them waiting any longer.

All right.

Dad!

Dad!

What happened next?

I don't remember.

How did you get back home?
I don't know.

And your father?

I never saw him again.

Your mother...

How did she react?

It was never spoken of.

And then...

There was a mental illness.

They took her to live at the hospital.

And it's this memory
that's been haunting you?

No.

Not the memory.

I've been seeing him.

Who have you been seeing?

The showman.

At first he was just a glimmer
in the corner of my eye.

But now...

Now he's right there.

Everywhere.

I see him everywhere.

Would you like another sedative?

No.

It won't matter.

He won't go away.

You can't numb him away.

I'll just wake up and
he'll still be there...

And one day...

He's going to turn around

and I'm going to see his face.

Mr. Hatcher-

You're all going to see his face.

You're all going to see everything.

Mr. Hatcher...
