My client is a very important businessman.

He knows what he wants.

Do you speak English?
Yes?

For I have said, young girls.

These are young girls.

The older they get...

The more they are used.

Maybe it's time that I'm doing things
elsewhere.

No.
It's okay.

We will soon have fresh young girls...

From the mainland.

Totally good, okay?

Do you want another one?
Another drink.

If you lie to me...

I'll kill you both.

So you want a little girl?

A virgin. 4000.

She's not back stitched right?

No, absolutely fresh and new.

Because I am a doctor and I can see it.

3000.
2000.

And I tell my friends that you like virgin girls
sells those that are not.

Take him outside.

Not you, cabbie.
Only the white man.

What do you want?
A tip right?

Fuck off.

For this month.

Stone.

Paper.

Scissors.

Rock, paper, scissors.

Isolated and difficult to reach without being noticed.

A perfect place for little girls to hide.

Here is the one that matters.

He calls himself the Duke. American clothing,
drives an American car.

This guy is fixated on Americans.

You wonder why it is so difficult to catch
.

Than  Captain Lee is the right person for this
right?

Stable? He is part
of anything we have done so far.

What we need is hard evidence
what a lawsuit by state.

I want these pedophiles condemned.

In the eight years that I'm here,
we have 100 girls rescued.

25 Perpetrators arrested and 20 convicted.

The problem is hardly diminished.

The supply of children is inexhaustible
because he always get away.

Angkor Wat Temple attracts tourists and
tourists bring money.

We need the power of their weapons behind it.

About this rig.
Are the ex military? Maybe police?

Duke has a network.
Ours must be larger.

Okay, that's it for today.
We go again tomorrow.

Do I look like an idiot you think?

Because if I say...

Young virgins, I mean that.

Two, to be exact.

For a month, real virgins.

From five or six years old and
assured of their virginity.

Then I accept that, but the seven-year-olds have
still prefer.

They monitor the trade in underage girls.

Is not that your specialty?

You ask me for dangerous things.

I'm asking you because you deliver.
Because you have supplied.

What you are asking is very expensive.

A real virgin once.
4000 U.S. dollars.

Two Virgins, a month?

Duke, you know I'm a man of my word
.

Yet?

And you know that I am willing
to do business, right?

The deal is for two.
Freshly picked...

Flowers. For a month.
So we do business?

Morning.

New feature but same old hours?

I know I promised earlier
home.

A new team.
We owe it to the setting.

I know.

I'm just happy to wake up next to you
.

It is much better than all those weeks apart
and no form of communication.

You know the army.

Hurray.

This is different, I promise.
We'll see.

I wanted to come along with the program in the village.

I thought you volunteer
was in the shelter and not in the village.

I am an invitation.

And how did you do that?

New country, new culture.

That is good.
Is that so?

We have four weeks even as
far unpacking boxes.

If you have not missed it then
did you not really necessary.

I believe so, yes.

You have not hung paintings.

Alex, every time I go to the
girls in the shelter, I see Abigail.

We never talk about her.

We even say her name
here.

I do not lose her. I miss her.
I forget her scent.

I remember the feel of her hands around my neck
.

I have no more time for her to cry
.

And that scares me.

Girls, Claire has brought some goodies.

Most of our girls come from villages.

Like these, very poor.

With this work, they learn how they positively
to their people to give back.

That's great.
This is the house of a widow.

A widow?

It's been a year with us.

I heard her say,
maybe writing?

The next step in her recovery process
is sharing her story.

Want to play?

I can not. I got to school today
of my mother.

I get it.
My mother is a teacher.

My mother is the best teacher.
Yeah, I know.

Eat your breakfast.

So you big and strong is
and grandpa can help in the shop right?

Got my red bird passing by?

Why do you have socks on your hands?
Work Here?

I first lived in America but
when mommy got sick...

We came here to be with Grandpa.
Have you seen my red bird or not?

I love red birds.
I.

What is your name?
What's wrong with you, man?

You know he's coming.
Go to the secret place.

Are you going home. Hurry up.
Make it your way.

Make it your way.

Morning.
I have an appointment with Captain Sin Lei.

He is transferred.

I'm Captain Pakkadey.
The new captain here.

There is nothing about us that transfer.
I'm Alex Becker.

Welcome, Alex Becker.
Thank you.

Apologies but my Cambodian is not so good.

If you forgive me my English.

Cute family.
Yes, a boy and a girl and a road.

You should be very happy that you
many children.

The karma of my family is very good.

I'm here to speak for
children who do not have a father.

Does Captain Sin Lei you informed
cooperation with our organization?

We are here at the invitation of your government.

We do work that no organization can do alone...

Because it requires some exchange of information.

Our goal is every brothel in the city to close
that small children for the sex trade.

Do you know this man?
I've seen him before.

We have investigated complaints about
its activities.

But we could find no evidence.

That you're probably getting.

All these men are known pedophiles
from other countries.

We send these photos to Interpol.

This is about the fear exchanges...

So that women and girls do not have to fear
to live.

Those who pimp
that should properly be afraid.

Supply and demand. We stop the delivery
and prosecute those questions.

I'm still your support and
of the police in this neighborhood?

There's something in your
Western thought which you do not understand.

I have many children rescued.
That itself back to the owners wanted.

In the Asian culture...

Is the duty of the child to
for parents to worry.

Usually these families so poor that they can not live
.

A child is sacrificed for the rest.

Poverty is no excuse for a child to prostitution
to surrender.

In any culture.

And you think that if you catch this criminal...

You can change that problem?

In Cambodia we have a saying.

The tiger is dependent on the forest...

Just like the forest depends on the tiger.

You Americans want a fight...

That can not be won.
And if this was your daughter?

The world takes on, Captain.

And will remember who helped and who is not.

Mr. Becker, you have our full cooperation.

I'm sorry for the challenge
but this is not easy.

The more you do the right thing all the
easier it goes.

Hello, Miss Claire.
Good morning, Nha.

I hoped that I could deliver my bike so
to the pedal can look...

It makes a clicking sound.

Good tours, beautiful ladies.
Very good and cheap.

I'm sorry but we are already at
Angkor Wat before. But thanks anyway.

A dollar please.
A dollar.

Now get out here please.
The lady has been there before.

Maybe a new bike?

I have very good quality bikes.
Specially made in Europe.

I'm afraid I do not know much
bicycle off...

Except what color I like.

Some want to sell you crap.

This is my granddaughter.

I found that red scarf that you wore yesterday
very nice.

Yes, I mean.

It's my mother.

So the rumors are true.

A new resident in your home.

Go back and stay there.

Were you working on something old man?

Nha Is everything okay?

Then I'll come back another time for
to repair or a new bike.

Grab your things again?
What do you want?

I'll collect your debt.

I have money for you.

Not enough to repay what you owe
.

With a girl like that...

'd Lost a lot of debt.

You owe me $ 3,000 owed.

Give me the girl and your fault
is waived.

Disappear.

It's a fair price.

There are no outstanding debts that are not collected.

The main part of this research
is this man...

He calls himself the Duke.

He has his work moved from Phnom Phen
to Siem Reap for tourists to use.

And like most pimps, he fills his
brothels with young Vietnamese girls.

The vulnerable.
In Cambodia without citizenship...

Without rights and poverty...

They are vulnerable targets for these traffickers.

I thought we were talking about girls from
Kahmai.

My people.
He understands that term.

I understand enough to know when
someone hears me, but not listening.

Do not be naive, every child is at risk.
Especially those by misunderstanding...

Think that having sex with a virgin cures you
of the disease AIDS.

What kind of tourists we looking for?

The average income in Cambodia is one U.S. dollar per day.

And those girls are sold into slavery
for 300 U.S. dollars.

And then there are the pimps.
They often earn U.S. $ 4,000.

So who do you think we look?
Foreigners.

Foreigners of all nationalities.
All shapes and sizes.

All backgrounds and economic living standards.

The best thing you can do is go where
trouble and keep your eyes open.

It is not long before trouble arises.

Everything you say is very good...

But you come to our country
without our people understand.

Our history and our ways.

If an accident occurs on the streets
stop the people, out of fear...

That they are to blame for the accident.

Wisdom says...

Dangkorboom We must grow in our garden.

Our work in Kmehr, for the same tree,
means silence.

To survive it is best to remain silent
.

Captain, these are pictures of
the Angkor Wat temple, right?

My wife and I have made
when we first visited your country.

I am proud.
I let them magnify to 8 x 10...

So that I could hang them in my office.

These temples are the pride of the people of Cambodia.

In fact earn your money with those photos, right?

What is the name of this tree again?

Dangkorboom.
Right, the Dangkorboom. Interesting.

Same tree as you would in your garden plants...

As a symbol of silence.

Do you find it not ironic that the roots of this tree
of silence...

Slow the Ankor Wat temples swallow?

Your eyes stay shut for
abuse of children for sex trade will...

Finally your culture and people swallow.

I believe that here very many good men...

Who no longer want to remain silent.

Do you agree with that Captain?

I stand for the group.
May I help you?

You must understand that the girls
do not want to hear, because you are here.

Most western people take pictures
and leave nothing behind.

I know you're not like those other
foreigners.

Although I come from the USA...

We all share a common grief.

A so deep that I almost forgot
how to cry.

When my husband in Afghanistan
stationed with our army...

My daughter and I were home alone
in America.

And we lived in a nice neighborhood...

The kids played in the park and
went by bike to school.

I knew all my neighbors and they knew me.

Life seemed very good and safe
to see.

Abigail was seven.

She loved puppies and...

Dressed like the pink.

And she drew
like princesses who walked hand in hand and...

Then she said, this is you mom.
And this is me.

On that morning I
her ready for school and...

I opened the front door to
her to school.

Okay, listen baby.

If you're at school and Rosie wants
some of your snacks...

Not give her the whole bag.

It's great that you want to share but
mom has made for you.

I'll tell you a secret.

Mama has an extra snack in
done for Rosie.

This is probably Aunt Sarah.
If you wait a minute?

And she was gone.

Like she was wiped from the earth.
She was...

And every time that I have tomorrow
repeated in my mind...

And wondered what could have
call so important that I had lost sight of.

We found her body.

In a pasture, a year later.

I love my little girl
more than I can ever say.

I make drawings.

Do you want to make a drawing?

That's all right.
He â€‹â€‹is my grandfather.

He's very nice.

Where did you meet this girl?

Outside the funny houses nearby.

You can play here but behave nicely.

See, I told you he was nice.

Hello, Sophea.
Hello Miss Claire.

I'm here for Alex.
Yes miss, he's in his office.

I know him.

I know him, I've just seen him.

That little girl is in danger.
We stop briefly.

Alex, I've seen that man today.
In the bike shop below our apartment.

The little girl who lives at risk
is not it?

This man does not know yet but we're getting close to
.

He has not escaped me.

Is that all?
Should we not now directly behind him?

We are doing.
It's just not that simple.

I came to ask if you wanted lunch.

If you encounter him somewhere
is it important to you to behave normally...

He's just a man.
Tell me where and when you've seen him.

But do not go looking for him.

Please, promise me.

Are you safe?
I train here all my life for.

80 U.S. dollars, for the small to eat.

120 U.S. dollars with the other
for boom-boom.

Nervous?

It is better for the business if you
the air here lets make.

Now you know why I put them in my hotel
delivered wants.

And I'll invite some friends.

These girls are a good start...

But we should have more.
Many more girls.

Yes, more girls.

You should here have sex with them.

Then I know you're not lying.

You know Duke, I can guarantee
I'm not a trafficker.

But my taxi driver, I am not sure.

Now very sweet little girl.

It's okay.
I will save you.

I know that taxi driver.

Can I talk to you?
Of course.

I was ten years old.
My little sister was five.

My mother died a few years earlier.

My father and brother worked all day in the fields.

Life was very hard.

We had little to eat.

One day, someone from our village
promise us he...

To a special trade would help.

Instead he sold us
to a sex trafficker.

Far away to the south.
And we never came back.

We were locked in a dark room.

We were told that we would not eat or drink
get...

Unless we learned how we could please men.

They allowed us to watch porn.

And we were forced to watch other children
...

Who have lived in this brothel than we were.

So we knew what we had to do and how.

My little sister did not survive...

But she suffers no more.

I sometimes have nightmares...

I'm scared, I wake up...

In my new house.
With my new family.

And then I know I'm safe.

If a bunch of flowers in a muddy riverbed...

Coming up to the surface
and be touched by sunlight.

White blossom,
we have lots of flowers.

And we have reached out to the sunlight.

Like my little sister.

Abigail is now in a safe place.

Anyone ever tell the story of
princess Veraly?

I love princess stories.

Princess Veraly reigned over the country of Cambodia.

She loved all Khmer people.
And they loved her.

And they lived in a large palace with towers
like this and...

Which extended far to the sky.

But one day the prince came from the east...

With his army across the ocean
to our country to conquer.

The people were very afraid.

But not the brave princess Veraly.

She stood on the highest part of her palace...

Grabbed her bow and arrow...

And with one shot...

Flew the arrow through the country
and the ship landed in front of the prince.

The prince was so impressed that he
to those brave person did search...

His mighty army had stopped.

Princess Veraly did the dance that the story
of its people portrayed.

The prince had never seen anyone so beautiful...

And he was immediately in love with her.

And when they married
fourth nationwide party.

And they lived happily ever after.

Thus ends every beautiful fairy tale princesses.

Wash your face.
I need to talk to you.

Whore.

I let you and your friends in the village continue...

Because you have proven your loyalty.

Now you will all live here
because you have deceived me.

Please, I must return to the village.

I will not cheat.

Your mother needs you sold me.

I'm your only family.

I'm more than a good friend.

Imagine my disappointment...

When I found out that you have something for me
hiding.

A little sister...

And not share.

While the whole family can thrive.

If your mother were alive, she would
your little sister to sell me.

If you do not tell me where she is
will suffer.

She can not hide forever
for me.

You do not hurt me.

What man wants a girl
beat up?

My dear  You Lie...

Watch the men actually do to you?

Bring them inside.

Tell me girls...

You Lie has a little sister
who lives in the village?

Lives a child with her?

She has a sister.
Shut up.

Her name is Tuyen.
Everybody in town knows it.

This is none of your business.

I also know that she's friends with
the granddaughter of the bike dealer.

She's lying.

You know it's true bitch.
You want us all suffer through your lies.

Let this be a lesson for your entire home.

If that little girl in your house
maybe go with me?

Hello darling, what a surprise.

No, that's my fault.
I have the whole schedule changed.

Things went wrong, I'm sorry.
I thought you were still in bed.

No, it is converted.
I have meetings all day.

Are you sure you have seen them?
Are you sure?

Alex, I was not thinking.
I wanted the same.

May Thank you
Two beers please.

Give the kids a hug.

I'm coming.
I have to go.

Okay, I love you too.

You are discovered.

I do not like a member of my team so
discovered.

I have family in Bakh Pei.
Do you think it vellig to go?

Do you think it is safe for a while
Bakh Pei to go?

May, look there.

If we do not know the number
get your drink from the band.

I passed him when he came in and heard
his accent, he is an American.

Are there any requests?

If you want a picture with my friend?

Our first  raised with...

A lovable little girl.

Sir, come hither.
This is very good.

Do you know where this comes from?
Do you?

These are copies of copies of copies.
This is stolen.

It is a major organized crime here.

Here they earn millions of dollars with
and several millions of human beings.

You stand at the bottom of the food chain
and you feed it and continue feeding.

Do you enjoy criminals support?
Those little girls forced into sex slavery?

'Cause you're doing.
You're part of it.

Well, fortunately we have good photos
of this man.

I send them to Interpol.

Yes, you need to gather your belongings and family and to
Bakh Pei go.

I'll call you on your mobile.

I appreciate your friendship.

We did well in the village.
And now here we are.

Where are you?

Military tourists always come back home.
After Abbey you never came back.

Are we therefore here?

We are here because someone has to do it.

The courses, skills.
I know.

But it is pretty good if you do not always know what to do...

If you do not always have all the answers.

Even if you prefer not to talk about.
It's okay, I'll wait.

I do not know what you think
to wait.

I wait until we are a family again.

I do not mean a child.

I already accepted.

I mean a family
all share together...

The pleasure and pain.

It is not yours to all my pain
and yours alone to bear.

I lost her.
What?

I lost her tonight.
I was not in the right place.

On the market.
I was not fast enough.

I had no accurate plan which worked.

I lost her.

Another little girl.

I'm so sorry.

Who is that?

They were my inspiration.

Amy Nha's granddaughter and the other girl lived near

What is going on?
I got to the office, I have a lot to do.

Why, what did I say?

I have messed up.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

I did not volunteer for that second tour
got it done...

And I was in the wrong place.

I was in the wrong place for the girl for you...

I was in the wrong place for Abbey.

Shantha, what is it?
What's wrong?

Kim-Ly, have you seen Kim-Ly?

Today in the shelter.
She's looking.

We go to the village work.
I'll go with you.

We are looking for a girl from our
shelter who helped with your roof.

Have you seen her?

She was here looking for her mother.

The blue house in the alley.

Good evening.
We are looking for our friend Kim-Ly.

Have you seen her here?

She cares for her family.

Is Kim-Ly returned to the brothels?

What is it? Did something happen to her?

If the range is small, they are worth that much.

But when supply increases
you they are still on the market.

As a mother being, would you be ashamed.

Ready to go.
Come on, guys. Please.

We focus today on the brothel Duke.

The identity of one of our men
yesterday may have been in danger...

Why we must now act immediately
us warrant.

Remember, these men will be armed.

As we speak is your captain
and a few of our men in one of the houses...

Likely for child prostitution
is used.

This is it.
Come on.

Go.

Withdrawal.

All clear.

You Sophea and stood at the front,
two agents at the rear.

We saw him go in,
but no one saw him leave.

No one on the street.

The journey there.

It is hollow.

There is good ice.
Then we go back to the hotel...

And then we're going to clean up
because you're a dirty girl.

You said you to all who have participated in successful missions
...

And you let go with Le
same taxi vest.

Is that your exit strategy
Booking and run away?

The agreement was to have him...
You're just went inside.

They had not challenged as
if two agents in that room.

What are you trying to prove?

I want those lines to be figured out...

And I want a team in those neighborhoods
where he picks up the children.

We've searched the streets
and nobody knows anything.

You do know that the time frame is very short...

Before he disappears with children
and we can not find him.

Maybe you should have asked sooner for help
.

I have a treaty with the Cambodian National Police.

This allows me to do what I do.

And your generals oversee
on those operations.

In your country cops fired
if they bribed for 5,000 real.

What do you buy for 5,000 real?

12 Eggs and some bananas?

Information about a police raid
is surely worth more? What is it worth?

Thanh Le was beaten.

He is in the hospital.

You coordinate it here.
Captain join. I have my mobile. Stay in touch.

What happened?

The criminals in the brothel.

My family.
No one knows who I am or where they are.

This message is a warning.

I have the police reports
read on your service.

I know about your successful raids
and then suddenly that series of failed raids.

I ask nothing you do not want to answer.

<i> You Americans fight in a war that
can not be won. </ I>

<i> this month. </ I>

<i> To survive, it is best
if you keep quiet. </ i>

<i> Whether you survive depends on me. </ i>

<i> Remember that, Captain. </ i>

<i> And you think, if you have one criminal
packed that you can change the problem? </ i>

<i> The karma of my family is very good. </ i>

Where you come from , you can not go here
get and child sexual abuse...

And get away with it.

Can  East meets West
and agree on that?

Duke, am I safe?

I arrived this morning at your premises
and swarming with police. Am I safe?

Quiet.
There is no problem, my friend.

I suggest my customers never disappoints.

It's good.

I had the girl or leave.

I liked her.

I liked her very much.
I'm not paying for it.

This is for my disappointment and frustration.

We will call her a free appetizer.

New agreement.

If two girls so hard,
I pay you for the right $ 30,000.

For one month.

From a sweet, sweet flower.

Delivered before midnight tonight at my hotel room.

They should be nice and young and they must be fresh.

Your fresh cut flower
ready to be delivered.

You will not stop until you get to the
meeting in Phnom Phen are.

Understood?

Thank you.

If you hear anything, let it be
the authorities know, please.

Wherever you are in the world,
you always meet the same people.

We have said nothing.

He is now very good.
Not as good as the Pucho would be.

How much you get for the repair?

You did so much for him.

You must let me pay.

Now I Pucho buy.
Look, Grandpa.

The Royal Palace of Princess Veraly.
Can we go there?

One day we can go.
Grandpa has much work to do.

I have an idea.
To show my appreciation to...

If you do not mind, can I take her
? I know it quite well there.

I'd like to take her.
Grandpa, can I join? Please?

We find a Vietnamese man who calls himself Duke.

Do you or your family members seen this man
in the last 24 hours?

A while ago...

20 minutes ago approximately,
I saw him and some of his men...

Girls from the neighborhood in a blue truck stop.

Have you heard where they were going?
Pnom Penh.

I have understood.
We are on his trail.

Truck to Pnom Penh rides.
Many girls back.

Then we meet in the slum neighborhood.

Calm down.
I'm coming.

Princess Veraly palace must be there somewhere.

I'm sure.
We find it.

That's it. Can we go there?
Is that it? Above?

Well we are going to go.
Listen, these are the rules.

Walk very slowly.
You shoot for me and I'm right behind you.

Slow.

Careful.

The shawl was very nice in my dream.

It's still beautiful.

It depends on how you look at it.

Do you think that there is a red bird lives?

I think many birds and other animals
here to nest.

See you there?
Why? What is it?

We have to be very quiet.
We do not chase the red bird.

Alex, please take on.

Do not hang up.
I stay on the line.

We went to the chapel.
In the chapel are you?

The one you see in photos.
You think he's alone?

Can you take a picture? Just one.
Thanks.

One more, please.

I do not want you at risk.

Is there any other way than the one
where he was?

No, we're trapped.

We will save you.
Is anyone hurt?

Is she badly hurt?

She's not breathing.

I know that you are here.

Come on, sweetheart.
We have hidden long enough.

I'm tired of your kind seen.
Stop.

Shoot me.
The noise will attract tourists.

Do it.
Shoot me.

Shoot me.

Chickens squawk.

I know how that screams at
must have love.

You let chickens stop that screaming...

By his head cut off.

Run.

Help.

I leave my phone turned
so you can hear my conversation.

I'm at the Angkor Wat temple.
Duke, Claire and a little girl.

He is armed. I can not wait.
I'm going inside. He Claire.

Do not do anything stupid.

You can safely escape if you do what I say.

You're not a doctor.

You know what I'm doing here.

Do not come any closer.
Otherwise I kill that woman and then you.

You want the girl anyway?

She is mine.

You know I can not let that happen.

You have no weapon.
You can not stop me.

That's right, I have no weapons.

But the men who work for me
now have their guns aimed at you.

I'll prove it to you.
Stan, are you there?

I'm ready to shoot.

Give the signal and they will shoot.

Let's see if you want to get out of here alive.
This is the plan.

Let them go and take me.
I am your hostage.

Let them go.

Take me.

Kneeling.

I look for weapons.
