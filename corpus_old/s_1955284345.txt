{\an5}Eh, my name is
Charlie McCarthy, what's yours?

<i>- Vicky.
Oh, it's cute.</i>

<i>- Charlie?
Oh, Vicky, Mr. Bergen. Bergen, Vicky.</i>

<i>- How do you do.
How do you do.</i>

You know ventriloquism's always
fascinated me.- It has? - Hm!

Well, I'll be glad to
explain it to you.

I'd love to know, but,
really I must run...

<i>Oh, please stay.
It'll just take a minute.</i>

<i>Here, all right.
Well, ventriloquism...</i>

<i>It starts here, goes up here.</i>

And it comes out here.
It comes out there.

Tell me how do you talk
without moving your lips?

Eh... it's... well...

May I have your hand?

<i>Now you can feel the
muscles contract</i>

<i>in my vocal chords.</i>

Vocal chords?
Yes... oh, yes.

Yes.
Like this.

You're lovely.
<i>Did that come out of me?</i>

<i>I'm a little confused...
you're talking.</i>

<i>Can you throw your voice
just anywhere?</i>

<i>Oh, certainly! Yes.</i>

<i>Won't you sit down?</i>

<i>â™ª You don't get those years back</i>

<i>â™ª Time you wasted sleeping late.</i>

<i>â™ª Was it wise to throw
out your direction?</i>

<i>â™ª Before you knew your way?</i>

<i>â™ª You don't get your seat back</i>

<i>â™ª You got up and lost your place</i>

<i>â™ª You should learn 'bout
leaving in the middle</i>

<i>â™ª Now you're lost in space.</i>

<i>â™ª La-la la, la-la la ...&c...</i>

Finally movin' out, huh?

I wish!

Shut up.

<i>â™ª You don't get your dreams back</i>

<i>â™ª Once you've let them get away.</i>

<i>â™ª Late-night plans are
always disappearing.</i>

<i>â™ª In the light of day.</i>

<i>â™ª You don't get those years back</i>

<i>â™ª You don't get those years back</i>

<i>â™ª You don't get those years back</i>

<i>â™ª You don't get those years.</i>

<i>â™ª You don't get those years.</i>

Hello.

C-can't you speak?

Should I put you back
in your case?

OK, I'm gonna put you
back in your box.- No!

So, you can speak.

Why aren't you speaking?

You're the worst vetriloquist
I've ever seen!

It's my first time
working with a dummy.

Who are you calling a dummy?

Oh, sorry.

Let me ask you something.

What?

Come here.

Come here.

Are you a retard?

No!

I mean... some people
might think that.

You can count me in.

That's not very nice.

Boo-hoo!

I made blintzes!

What is that?
Oh, very strange, Steven.

Do you want a cheese blintz?

No.

Ah... Lou,
come here look at this.

Mom!

Oh, great!

Just what we need,
another mouth to feed.

<i>Wha? What's happening?</i>
Can I...?

OK, Steven.

You're such a loser!

And in the book it says

we should get to know
each other, a bit.

I think we should have a very,

y'know, open relationship.

Shut up!
OK.

Steven, I'm making pancakes!

Not at the table, Lou!

Why not?

Morning!
I was hoping you were Steven.

How do you feel, honey?

I'm nauseated and
my neck is killing me.

You're probably just depressed, dear.

Mom, can I have the car today?
STEVEN!!

<i>You think we could not
yell today, please?</i>

I'm starting the S.S. Paulina.

The Krauts tried to sink'er 3 times.

Couldn't do it.
That's great, dad.

Mom please...
The pancakes are gonna be cold.

Those aren't even pancakes,
they're blintzes.

Well what do you think
pancakes are?

Your mother manages to make
everything look like a blintz.

Good morning!

Can I have the car today?
We'll see.

I'm quitting my job.

It's really important.
You know the Freed wedding.

OK honey, we'll see.
What do you mean â€œwe'll seeâ€œ?

Can I have the car or not?
Fern, it's a yes or no question, alright?

Thank you!
I'm quitting my job.

I have errands to run.

<i>Well, I only need it for
an hour and a half.</i>

Tell you what, I'll have
it back by 3 o'clock.

OK, dear.

Is that OK, yes I can have
the car or OK, no I can't?

Oh my God...

Your fiancÃ© spent
the night in jail.

What?

Right here, in the Police Report.

Drunk and disorderly,
that's my boy!

<i>Let's see that.</i>

Well, serves him right.
Hope you rot there. Fucking loser!

<i>Heidi!</i>

That loser was almost
your husband.

Why can't you get it into
your head he's a psycohpath?

I'm sure he is.

But he is also a very
successful accountant.

Have a good day at work, honey.

Come in.

Who's out there?

Hi, Mrs. Gurkel.
It's me, Steven.

Yeah, whadda-you want?

Fangora home?

Who?

Fanny.

<i>Where are you going?</i>

<i>- I'm going out!
You just went out!</i>

Mom, that's what people do.

They come home, they go out.
It's crazy, I know.

You gotta come back and get
my prescription. - Yeah, yeah.

You gotta get my prescription!
I'll get your prescription!

You are stupid!
You are so stupid!

Every time I leave the house!
This is bullshit!

Now do you see why
I'm so fucked up?

I can see it, sure.

OK, I got you something.

Oh no. You shouldn't have.

You can open it.

Open it!
All right.

D'you like it?
Oh!

Yeah, I love it.

Great, I lifted it from Borders.

You shouldn't have done that.

Steven, you're worth it.

OK, what are you doing on the 4th?

I dunno.

'Cause I just ordered some
kickass fireworks.

Like, even the Chinks
are scared of this shit!

You got balls, Steven.

Most people stay in their
nowhere jobs till they die,

but you; you fucking know what you
want and you're going after it.

That takes a big set
of iron balls.

We're gonna kick ass,
man, I can feel it,

Y'know, both of us.

You're gonna the
famous dummy guy

-I'm gonna kick ass with my band.
Ventriloquist.

Dude, this is gonna be our year,
I can feel it.

You can fuck me if I'm wrong.

Well, that's OK.

I'm glad things are going good
with the band, though. - Pfft!

The band sucks, man.

But we're gonna get a gig,
if I gotta kill someone.

I'm telling you, Steven,

both of us are finally
gonna kick some Goddamn ass!

Gurkel?
Yeah!

â™ª [PUNK ROCK]

â™ª <i>Slut!</i>

<i>â™ª Go through the door. Yo slut!</i>

<i>â™ª Don't be so bad, girl.</i>

<i>â™ª Yo Slut!</i>

â™ª <i>.. do what you can, girl!</i>

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Waaait!!

Dude, I dunno,

Can you do like...

like a wrreeww wrreeww!

You know, like in the chorus
"Yo, slut". Wrreeww!!

The way I like to work,
I do a lot of visualization.

So, I'd like to start off,

maybe, close your eyes.

Just relax.
Just breathe, in and out.

Now, I want you to imagine
the day of your wedding...

and there are all your
loved ones, there...

and your new husband's, there...

and you can hear the music...

Tell me what kinda music you hear?

It's that stuff they play
on "Fiddler on the Roof".

Klezmer music?
Yes! Yes, that's it. I love it.

OK, great, Klezmer music!

Wonderful. Wonderful.

An unusual choice,
but, yet a good one.

OK, let's keep going.

[â™ª KLEZMER ]

This guy went to Jerk school, I didn't
do nuttin' wrong it wasn't my fault!

I never called in, sick.

Forget about taking a vacation.

I worked overtime like crazy.
All I did was work, for this guy.

I was the hardest working guy there.
That's all I did!

And the name of
this last employer?

Big Al's Italian Beef.

The reason your job was terminated?

Oh, that would be for frottaging.

And your last place
of employment?

The Brickhouse Theatre.
A production of "Hedda Gabler."

It was brilliant.

That's when you rub up against

a stranger or a co-worker,
in a sexual way.

Was that this year or last year?

It was 1972.

I worked for
Donnelly Electronics.

Were you fired or laid off?

What's the difference?

Well, it has to do with

whether or not your former employer
can contest the claim,

a lay off just means
you were terminated

through no fault of your own.

If you were in my shoes,
wouldn't you fire yourself?

Well, I guess I was fired.
Technically, I was fired.

OK, and...

is electronics your field?

I don't think so.

I don't think...

Donnelly, really, has anything
to do with electronics.

I don't really know what they do.
I know they sell stuff, but...

OK, so...

you would describe yourself,
as in... sales?

OK.

And are you hoping to find work
in a similar field?

Ah, no.

OK.

Oh, um, do you have any
vocational training

that could assist our job search?

Ummm...

Any technical training?

Ummm...

What kind of work
are you looking for?

Um... ventriloquism.

Excuse me?

Ventriloquism.

V-E-N...
No, no...

It's OK, I know how to spell it.

Oh... right.

OK.

For now, just be sure
that you register

your unemployment
claim every 2 weeks

on your assigned day.

Meanwhile, I'm gonna put
your name on a list of

entertainers and maybe we
can help find you some work.

Do you have any questions?

OK.

Well, If you have any
questions,

you can just give me a call
at this number.

My name is Lorena.

U-huh!

You're all set.

What? Oh!

[ EROTIC SIGHS ]

Lou, you want a tuna sandwich?

Do I have a choice?

<i>Steven, you want a tunafish sandwich?</i>

Could you hold on
for one second, please?

I'm on the phone!

You hungry?

I'm on the phone.

Oh, OK, do you want a sandwich?

No.

Oh.

OK, fine.


Why are you paying attention to me,
right now?... Hm?

It's the movement of my head,
my eyes and my body.

Now, watch as I transit focus to Eugene.

As you can see, Alan is
now transiting focus,

by transfering the kinetic energy
of his eyes and his body, into me.

Isn't that correct, Alan?
That's right, Eugene.

And now, thanks to Eugene's
line of vision...

Can we try coming to class
on time, folks?

Yeah, the class starts at 8 o'clock.
Right.

Well, let's do a few minutes
of transiting focus, now.

[ â™ª ]

Steven.
Michael!

What are you doing?
I need to talk to you.

What is it?
It's about Heidi.

Well, maybe you should talk to her.

You know, she won't talk to me.

Is she seeing anyone?

OK, don't answer that. Wait.

Let me ask you this.

Does she, at all, talk about me?

No. I mean, yeah,
every once in a while.

Really?

Listen Steve,
I want you to know something.

I have changed, so much.

I mean, I'm, like, a different person.

My drinking is completely
under control.

I've been seeing a shrink
about my temper.

I mean, if she could
only see what I've become.

I'm also in a play.

Yeah, it's community theater, but...

it's a fantastic opportunity
for me to express myself.

Michael, I really have to go.

Oh no Steve, Steve, I need you.

You're the only one,
I feel like, I can trust.

Will you just tell her,
you ran into me.

A random encounter.
And that I look great.

Just tell her you saw me, and:

"Michael looks great. He seems happy.

"It's as if he's completely changed,

"just turned himself around."

Will you do that for me?

Please, you've no idea
how much this means to me.

I dunno.
Oh Steven...

I beg of you, I beseech you!

Please, just say that to her.

Just tell her you saw me,
a chance encounter

and that I'm doing great. Please!

OK, I'll talk to her
in the morning, all right?

You won't regret this.

OK, all right.
Good night.

Good night.
Oh, hey!

Here... this is a flyer
for the play.

I'll try to get you comps,
but I can't promise.

that belongs to me,</i>

<i>â™ª I'll have the man
that belongs to me,</i>

<i>â™ª to share the door and the floor,</i>

<i>â™ª and the bed and the chair,
and my own morning.</i>

Do you want French toast?
No. - You sure?

I'll have some.
Hello...

I don't wanna make it
if no one's gonna eat it.

I'll eat it.
You don't need it, Heidi.

What does that mean?
Nothing, nothing.

I just know what happens
when you're depressed.

Mother, I'm not depressed.
Are you telling me that I'm fat?

No, not at all!

I'm just trying to
keep you from getting fat.

I know, when I'm depressed,
I tend to put on a few pounds.

Mother, stop telling me
that I'm depressed!

Besides, I don't want
your French toast,

I don't need your French toast.

I've got a wedding to plan.

I sure wish this were your
wedding you were planning.

Do you know our high school
reunion's coming up?

Ten years.

Do you know how depressing that is?

Do you think I don't wanna,
fuckin', slash my...

wrists when I think about that?
Goddamit!

It's, like, you finish
high school, and then what?

I'm supposed to be
in New York City,

selling out CBGB's.

What the fuck are we
still doing here?

I just wanna make something
happen with my music, you know?

<i>You will.</i>

Oh, that's my employment
councillor. - Huh?

My employment councillor.
Who, her?

Please don't point.

I wouldn't point.
Hey!

You got the hots for her?

No! ... I dunno.

<i>Dude, she's got a kid!</i>

Maybe, she's baby-sitting.

Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

There's no smoking, here.

So, how did you lose your last job?

Oh, man, I haven't had a job
in, like, 15 years.

So, you've been unemployed
all this time?

Dude, that's exactly my point,
that's why I'm here!

OK. Um...

Miss Gurkel, to get...
Fangora.

Fangora.

To get unemployment...

you have to have had a job
in the last 18 months. - What?

Yeah. The benefits are for people who
have worked at least 6 months. So...

I'm afraid that
you're not eligible.

Wait a second.
I'm unemployed.

Oh yes. I know.

All right, let me get this straight:

to collect unemployment,
I gotta get a job,

I gotta work for 6 months,

then, I gotta get fired,
then, I can get my money?

Well, I guess, if you
put it that way, yes.

Man, that's bullshit!

Maybe I should just get married,

find a guy with a lotta money,
you know what I mean?

That's one option.
You know what I mean.

I mean, you're married, right?

Me? No, I'm not married.

You sure?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

'Cause you seem like
you might be married.

You know, you seem like the family type.
So, what, are you just engaged? - No.

Got a boyfriend?
<i>- No.</i>

Dating anyone,
or just sleeping around?

No.
Divorced?

No, I've never been married.


Excuse me?

She's a dyke.

I can't believe you went there.

Hey, I didn't just do it for you.

I wanted in on some of that
unemployment cash, you know?

I'm broke.

Yeah, but, you didn't
mention my name, did you?

Hell, no!

Look, don't worry, alright!
She didn't suspect anything.

And what about the little girl?

<i>Look... in the worst
case scenario,</i>

<i>it's her kid. At least
we know she puts out.</i>

<i>Listen you've gotta get
one of these!</i>

What is it?
I love these things! - What?

It's a fucking swing.

I grew up on one
of these things.

My mom used to leave me
sitting in here for days.

I don't need that, really.
Oh, shit!

<i>How do you like your new clothes?</i>

<i>I feel like an altar boy.</i>

Oh, I think you look really nice.

You know, we have
a lot of work to do.

You mean, you have
a lot of work to do.

Nuttin' wrong with me,
you're the one who sucks.

Well, maybe you can help me.

I'm not sure there is
any help for you.

Look, I wanted to be a
ventriloquist my whole life.

You're gonna help me
and not be so critical.

Is that a threat?

Who's the mothball?

Shh, it's my grandma.

Is, or was?

Grandma's my favorite person.

Yeah, that's 'cause she's the
sanest one in this funny farm.

I guess I didn't really have
that many friends in high school.

I didn't really have any.

What about Fangora?

Yeah, I guess we were friends.

You know, she didn't have
many friends, either.

Go figure!

We kinda stayed close,
even when I went off to college.

You went to college?

Yeah. Went to community college
for two years.

Ooh, what a regular Einstein!

Whatever. I stopped going
'cause I didn't really like it.

You failed out of community college?
You are a moron!

I didn't fail, I just...

needed to work at my own speed.

Oh, so you're slow.

No.

Look, the thing I don't
understand is...

You always knew you wanted
to be a ventriloquist,

why'd you wait so long to do it?

Well I think people need to
go at their own pace,

there were other things
that I had to do.

Well, I got news for you, buddy

you're almost 30 years old.

You quit your job to buy a doll.

You failed out of community college.

And you live at home with your parents.

You are a loser.

<i>â™ª Pam!</i>

<i>â™ª pada pada pumpum...</i>

Hey!

Hey!

You look like you need a ride.

Thanks.

How's it goin'?

Hey, I'm actually
going to your place!

Oh, great.

How's it goin'?

Great! I have a huge wedding,
coming up.

I thought you broke it off.

Not mine. I'm planning one,
for someone else.

Hm, that's nice of you.

It's not a charity,
it's a business.

So what about the singing, huh?

What are you doing
with your singing?

Yeah, what about it?

Well, I mean you got
a great voice.

Are you doing anything with it?

What am I supposed to do?

You can't spend your whole life singing,
you know. It's not very realistic.

Man, that's bullshit!
What do you think I'm doing?

You're just like Steven.

What's that supposed to mean?

Well, he's always
selling himself short too.

<i>What do you think I should call you?</i>

Listen, don't call me, I'll call you.

something, how about Bob?</i>

Bob? ... Bob.

So, like, what do you do?
I do everything.

I'm the wedding planner!
I plan things.

You know like I do all the hiring.

I hire the caterer,
the flowerist, the...

I hire the band.

The band? - Yeah.
What kinda band?

I'm trying to find a Klezmer band.

Ahem! <i>â™ª She'll be coming round
the mountain when she comes</i>

What are you saying,
you have a Klezmer band?

Oh, hell yeah! I mean,
we play other stuff too,

but we specialize in
the Klezmer shit.

You're kidding, that's amazing!

Wow, I didn't even know
you were Jewish!

You know, this could be very
beneficial to the both of us. - Why?

Because every Klezmer band
in town is booked,

and I desperately need a band.

But if I hire you,

you have to be willing to 'hora'?
Is that a problem?

Oh, man, at this point
I'd fuck anyone.

<i>â™ª She'll be coming round
the mountain</i>

<i>â™ª She'll be coming
round the mountain...</i>

<i>â™ª when she comes</i>

Yeah, yeah!

Try it again?

Steven.
Hi.

How's it goin'?

Um, I dunno, could be better.

I think I need to take
another class, or something.

I got the fireworks.

Listen, can you do me a favor?

My mom'll kill me
if she finds them.

They're really fuckin' dangerous.

Think I can keep them here?

Sure.

<i>Hey, Steven, telephone.</i>

<i>It's a girl.</i>

Hello?
<i>Hi, Steven?</i>

This is Lorena from the
unemployment office. Remember me?

Hello?

Ah... yeah...

Hey, how's your
ventriloquist act coming?

<i>Ah... good, good.</i>

Great. Listen, I'm just calling
to tell you

that we've got a response
from a theatrical agent

who's very interested in
meeting with you.

my fucking grandma.</i>

<i>But you know what?</i>

<i>That's actually an insult because
my grandma drives better than you do.</i>

<i>- Steven!
All right!</i>

All right, now you've gotta
ask her out.

No.

Steven, she's calling you at home.

She's my employment counselor.
I mean...

isn't that a conflict of interest?

Bullshit!

OK, you always do this,
you chicken out.

You know you got balls, Steven,
you gotta use'em!

And dude, get some new glasses!

I'm telling you something

you're gonna ask the bitch out.

I'll think of something.
Just trust me.

What, the fuck, is klezmer music?

[â™ª Le Cygne - Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns]


<i>No, I'm just not gonna
be home tonight.</i>

I'll get a sandwich.

I dunno what kind of sandwich.
Yeah, I'll eat it in the car.

I'll eat the goddamn sandwich

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>No, no.</i>

<i>Yeah, ma...</i>

<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

<i>Don't keep asking.</i>

I want you to behave
yourself, OK?

OK. What kinda agent?

He's a talent agent.

Oh!

What are you doing here?

He's funny.
I wasn't joking.

What's eating you, termites?

Hey, let's show'em
how smart you are, shall we?

Um... What shape are my cufflinks?

You idiot, you're supposed to say
"what shape is the world?"

Sorry.
You're ruining my act.

don't worry.</i>

Yeah, but...

Steven, listen to me.
No offense, but you

don't know shit about women.
Sorry, but you don't.

You wanna get this girl
you gotta trust me.

You don't get a girl by sitting
on your ass, you gotta take action.

Steven!...</i>

C'mon.

Ow!
Shut up!

Now, do exactly as I do.

Oh?

<i>What the fuck!
Ouch!</i>

Goddamit, Jesus, get up!
My glasses!

Can't I just leave the flowers?

C'mon, we're not doing this
half assed!

Yeah but, isn't it vandalism?
Bullshit!

It's water soluble, alright?
It washes right off!

Jesus Christ, man, just hurry!

Can I use the car today?

Heidi, I have electrolysis at 10:30.

Fern, where is my glue? Huh?

Can I drop you off
and then pick you up?

Where did you leave it, dear?

<i>That's what I'm asking you, dear!</i>
Well, I don't know, honey.

Damn! A brand new tube!

Steven?

Gross!...
You look like a child molester.

Steven?

Can I borrow your car?
Mummy's being a total bitch.

Sure.
Really?

Thanks!

"Glass Menagerie"
starring Michael Fulliker?

What is this? What is...?
Is this a joke?

Your stalker gave it to him.

Quit kidding around, Steven.
What is he talking about?

Yeah, I-I ran into Michael
the other night. Chance encounter.

I think he misses you. - Ahah!

Yeah, he misses your loving arms.

You shut up!
I'm talking to my brother!

Now, what happened?

He looked great.
What?!

Yeah he wants me to tell you
he looks great.

And that he's really
got his shit together.

Ahah, and what else?
<i>- Um, he's seeing a shrink.</i>

Michael is seeing a shrink?!

And doing community theatre.

I... you...

Well, where'd you see him?

In the driveway.

Here? H-he came here?

I guess.
I don't believe this!

So, what, he's stalking me, now?

<i>No, I don't think so.</i>
He's stalking me!

I should call the police.
That's what I should do.

No, I don't think it's...

You didn't tell him
anything about me, did you?

No, wait a minute, you should.

You should, you should tell him
that I'm seeing somebody.

<i>You should tell him
that I'm seeing somebody else.</i>

Ah... a lawyer.

Yeah, that's it, you tell him,

you tell him that I'm dating
an attorney.

Because that'll kill him,
because he's only an accountant.

You tell him...
you tell him how happy I am,

with my attorney.

Listen Steven, the police
are here to see you.

Steven?

Yeah?

<i>We got a complaint
from a Lorena Pancetti.</i>

Did you visit her house, last night
between the hours of 11:PM and 3:AM?

Yeah.

You wanna tell us
what you were doing there?

Why?

Listen pal, she did not appreciate
the romantic gestures.

Oh!

Go, go!

W-was she upset?
Upset?!

Upset enough to call the police!
What the hell did you do?

Oh, I knew it was a bad idea.

Y'know, I can call her
right now and apologise.

I wouldn't do that if I were you,
I'd have to arrest you.

What is this?

It's a temporary restraining order.

What?

Look Steve, you seem like a nice kid.

Now I'm sure you're not a psycho,
but evidently she thinks you are, so...

for your own sake,
just stay away from her, OK?

You sniffing my airplane glue, too?

she's some prissy little suburban bitch...</i>

I put my ass on the line

No, fuck you!

No, Fanny.

<i>Fangora really got me in a mess.</i>

Bullshit!

Who told you to listen to her?

Well, she can be very pushy,
you know?

Listen Steven, there's no one
to blame, but youself.

You're an idiot, I mean,
how stupid could you be?

Well, now I've blown it
with this girl.

Aw, boo-hoo!

You gonna let a little
restraining order stop you?

Well, what am I supposed to do?


<i>â™ª And you can't expect
me to stay here.</i>

<i>â™ª And I don't wanna

<i>â™ª And I don't believe it's right.</i>

<i>â™ª It's 2:AM I'm next to you...</i>

But y'know, my friend,

I do something more dramatic.

Hiya, toots.

Her name's Lorena.
Oh, Lorena.

What's your name?
I don't have one.

What? How can you not have a name?

'Cause this dummy forgot
to give one.

He did?
That's not true.

He just didn't like the ones

Woody! Woody!
He wanted to call me Woody.

Woody's what you call an er...

Stop that, OK? Be polite.

So, you always meet

Very funny! Very funny.

'Bonjour' welcome to 'le Bagel'
may I take your order?

Ahm... I'll have a cappuccino.

OK, and you?

I'll just have a cup of coffee.
I'll take an espresso.

No, you're too young for coffee.
Aw, c'mon! I wanna coffee.

Shh!
What, have you got a slow leak?


One
Two.


I'm sorry for...
reporting you to the police.

Oh, it's OK, I understand.

It's just that...

my last relationship
left me a bit shellshocked.

He turned out to be a creep
and a real stalker, so,

you can understand when I saw
your little thank you note

I got a little bit freaked out.

I'm sorry.

I mean, I should've
known better, but...

I don't know much
when it comes to girls...

He ain't lyin'.

I don't believe it, you seemed
so confident on the video.

That was all me, toots.

I think it's great that
you live with your folks.

You don't think it's suspicious?

What do you mean?

You know, a guy my age,
living at home?

No. People used to live at home
with their parents all the time.

Until they were married.

How come you're not married?

Oh... Is that a stupid question?

I was engaged...

and we were planning a wedding
when...

when I got pregnant.

And um...

y'know we were so young
we didn't know what to do.

W-we kinda took it as a sign and
decided to go to City Hall, that week.

It was a Friday.

And um...

we were standing outside
the judges' chambers

waiting to go in, when we realized
that we didn't have any rings.

So, he went across the street
to the drugstore to get

those little rings with
the candies on them

and...

a half hour had passed and...

so, I went down to see
what was keeping him and...

I saw the police cars

and the ambulance. I knew...

He had bought the rings and

he was coming back
across the street...

Oh, I'm sorry. Gosh!

No, it's OK, it's OK.

I-I always look both ways
when I cross the street.

Well...

I guess this is good night.

Would you like to come over to
my house for dinner on Friday?

Are you asking me out on a date?

Well, if dinner with
my parents is a date...!

You're not gonna wear that
cologne, are you?

Well, it's eau de toilette.

Smells like something in the toilet.

You really need to be
more supportive.

I'm very nervous tonight.
Watch my hair.

Steven, are you trying
to scare her away?

from the girl left at the altar.</i>

Hey! - Heidi!

at the altar. God, I can't stand this place!</i>


Yes, can I help you?

Hi, I'm Lorena. This is Bonnie.

I'm sorry, we're in the middle
of dinner.

And we're Jewish.

I-I'm Steven's friend.

Oh! Oh, I thought you were
Jehova's Witnesses.

Come in, come in, please!

Hi.
Hi.

Hey, you didn't tell me
it was a double date.

I hope you don't mind,

my baby-sitter cancelled on me,
at the last minute, so...

Oh no no, that's perfectly fine!

Here why don't you come and sit down.
Thank you.

I'll get another place setting.

You sit here, sweety.

That's a good girl.

Put your purse right here.
Thank you.

Steven, why don't you
introduce your friend?

Um... this is Lorena.

Hi.
This is Bonnie.

Hi Bonnie, Lorena...

I'm Steven's father, Lou.
How are you? - Hi.

I'm sure you remember me.
Yes, how can I forget?

Hi, I'm Heidi.
Pleased to meet you, hi.

I'm Lorena.


<i>but she knows.
She knows what's going on.</i>

Bon, say hello?
Hi.

Would you like</i>

a glass of wine, 'Lenora'?
'Lorena'. I'd love one.

How about you, Bonnie?
A nice glass of milk?

Ma!

You know you can't eat solids.

Besides, I have a delicious
glass of brisket for you.


Are you sure that stuff's
still good?

Why wouldn't it be?
It's been in the fridge.

That was from my
retirement dinner.

So?
It was a year ago.

<i>Wine keeps, dear.</i>

Here you go, 'Lena'.

I thought her name was 'Lenora'.
It's 'Lorena'.

It's OK, thanks.

Anyway...  Cheers.
[FERN] Oh, yeah!

Mm!

You see?...
It's good isn't it?

Mm!

So, Bonnie...

I'm glad to have
someone my size to talk to.

Your lips are moving.

So... why don't you tell
us how you two met?

Well, I-I work at the
unemployment office.

Oh, how ironic!

Maybe you can get him a job, eh?

And Bonnie is your little sister?

Uh no, Bonnie is my daughter.

Oh!

You're married?
No.

Uh... do you like brisket, Lorena?

Yes.

Steven, do you mind, that thing
is really giving me the creeps.

Steven.
What?

Maybe it's time to put
the dummy away, alright?

He can do what he wants,
he's a grown man.

He's a grown man?!
He's sitting there with a doll in his lap.

Lou, you play with toy ships.
They're not toys!

They're scale models of
famous battleships;

a hobby I picked up when I retired,
it's very interesting.

So you should be
more sympathetic!

So, 'Leah',
what are you, divorced?

OK, let's change the subject,
shall we?

No, I'm not.
Heidi was engaged.

Hmph! Mom!

Well sweetheart, you were.

They were going to do it,
this spring.

Oh, what happened?

Nothing, he just
turned out to be a lunatic.

So, Lorena...

are you Jewish?

<i>Mother!
Just a question.</i>

No, I'm not, I'm Italian.
Oh, well! Same thing.

So...

Bonnie is your daughter.

Yup.

What's your name?

You know, I've been asking
the same question.

I don't have one.

So what do they do?
They just call you dummy?

Please, please, that's derogatory!

We prefer to be called
"people of wood".

That's cute.
Isn't that cute, Heidi?

Yeah, and it's not at all scary.

Heidi has been a little
depressed, lately.

I'm not depressed, I'm fine!
Hey, c'mon, no yelling.

Well why are you always saying
that I'm depressed?

You know how infuriating that is?

Sorry, Lorena.
She hasn't been the same,

since she broke off
the engagement.

Why are you apologizing to her?

She's an unwed mother!

Well, better an unwed mother
than just plain, unwed.

Really nice meeting you.


Sorry about dinner.
That's OK.

Thanks for carrying her.
Is she heavy?

No.

Um... uhm...
What?

Do you have any plans for the 4th?
I was thinking...

maybe we could see
the fireworks. - OK!

I thought, I mean, you don't have
to, but, if it's not a big deal,

like, maybe it might be nice.
I said, OK.

I'd love to.

Oh really?

Wow, OK.

And you made me feel like a fool.

Honey, it's not my fault

I only wanted you to be

I'm four feet away from you, huh?

Now, I'm two away from you.

Three feet. One foot.

Back off, buddy.

You're lucky, I'm over you.

Heidi!
Ohh!

Last chance.

Michael.

The police are here.
They're right behind you.

Nice try, Steve.

I turn to look,
you lunge at me.

Very heroic!

Fortunately, I'm not gonna fall for it.
Nice try, though.

<i>Freeze! Police!</i>

<i>Drop your guns and
put your hands up!</i>

Don't shoot!

What the hell? Aahh!

Aah!
Aah!

<i>â™ª You don't get your seat back</i>

<i>â™ª You got up and lost your place</i>

<i>â™ª You should learn 'bout
leaving in the middle</i>

<i>â™ª So you're lost in space?</i>

<i>â™ª La-la la, la-la la ...&c...</i>

Not another step.
I mean it!

Ohh...

Blanks. Prop.

Oh, my god! Are you OK?

<i>You really hit'im!</i>

<i>- How did you do that?
I threw my voice.</i>

You protected me.

Yeah.
Thanks.

Heidi?

Thake a good look at this face.

'Cause you will never,
ever, see it again.

"I blew out your candle",
Heidi. Good bye.

<i>â™ª You don't get those years back</i>

Can I please get the gun back?

It belongs to the theater.

Just give it to him.

Thank you.

I broke off the engagement.</i>


But you reakky came
to my rescue, boy!

Hey, how's your hand?
Fine... Ouch...

I didn't think you could
punch someone, like that!

Me, neither.
It was amazing!

Well, there's something
I need to take care of.

Thanks, Steven.

That was pretty brave.

No.
Mm, yeah!

Really?
Yeah.

*** Yeah.

I'm sorry...
Lorena...

<i>You shoulda kissed her, idiot!</i>

Don't rub it in.

<i>â™ª I want a door
that belongs to me</i>

<i>â™ª I want a bed
that belongs to me</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna know when
I climb into bed</i>

<i>â™ª I'll wake up in my own morning</i>

"For, nowadays...

"the world is lit by lightning.

"Blow out your candles.

"And so...

"good bye."

<i>â™ª I want a chair
that belongs to me</i>

<i>â™ª I wanna know when I rock
in that chair</i>

<i>â™ª I'll look up at my own ceiling.</i>


It wasn't too over the top, was it?

Oh, man, it was fucking beautiful!
Really?

Oh, no shit, man!

Are-are you a fuckin'
actor or something?

Yeah, yeah... what's your name?

Fanny.
-<i>Fanny.</i>

<i>I'm Michael.
Michael!</i>

The only thing moving
was your lips.
