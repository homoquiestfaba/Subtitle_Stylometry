<i>[screaming]
ahhhhh!!!!!</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

â™ª

I am moments away

From beginning my road trip
to Anders university.

Established in 1932.

I never thought
I'd get this chance.

I'm equal parts proud
and genuinely terrified,

But, we do not let fear stop us.

â™ª <i>...And I don't know</i>
<i>what to do.</i> â™ª

<i>â™ª It seems to me that you
and I were meant to be â™ª</i>

See you when I see you.

â™ª <i>how could I deny</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>the way that you walk</i>
<i>right by every day</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>every day,</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>every every day,</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>it's the same old way</i> â™ª

â™ª

<i>â™ª I want to get you home, â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I want to get you baby â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I want to get
your love â™ª</i>

Well, that's the last time
I let my mother help me pack.

Riley!

I got somebody to open the door.

Oh, yay.

Okay, let me see.
Okay, but-

I'll grab these.

<i>â™ª</i> ...<i> And I don't know</i>
<i>what to do â™ª</i>

You have to-thanks.

You packed my whole bedspread?

I didn't need a private room,
you know.

Oh, college is hard enough

Without playing roommate
Russian roulette.

Besides, you know,
by next semester

You could be in a house.

Wow.

That was a record, you know?

Twenty minutes without
mentioning pi gamma beta.

Impressive.

Mmm.

What if I'm not
sorority material?

Right, yeah. I mean a legacy
with a full scholarship?

You're just a dime a dozen.

Come on, any house would be
lucky to have you, okay?

Okay.

So, I'm thinking that I'm going
to go check into the hotel,

And maybe we can have
dinner later?

If it's okay I'm just going
to finish unpacking.

But we can totally tour
the lineup tomorrow.

I know you wanted to do that.

I do, and I just, you know,
you don't,

You don't have to start flying
solo immediately.

You got that?

Yeah.

You all right?

Hey.

Mom, I will be okay without you.

I don't like hearing that.

I know.

But I love you so much.

I love you more.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Okay.

Have a good dinner.

<i>â™ª</i>

Okay, get a grip Oâ€™Connor.

Smell: Mom's perfume.

Color: Pink suitcase.

Feel: Skin.

Hey.

Is there a wizard holding
you hostage?

Um, well, you could have,

You could make it into
a metaphor like that.

I was on my way to get dinner
from the cafeteria

And I couldn't make it
out the door.

Hmm.

Cafeteria food is to be feared.

Not what I meant, but, you know.

I think I know what you meant.

Severe gad.

Generalized anxiety disorder.

In more like a storm

Between me and everything, so.

Would it help if we
walked together?

I don't think that's
gonna happen tonight.

But you can go, I'll,
I'll, I'll be fine.

I mean yeah, you will, but
you'll also be super hungry.

And so, organic chemistry,
rock climbing, softball.

So you're a nerd and an athlete?

Is that what you're telling me?

Yeah, well, still the least
impressive in my family.

My mom is a literal
brain surgeon.

Stop.

Mm-hmm.

My dad too, but he died
what I was like two.

In a car accident.

I am so sorry.

I don't really have
many memories of him,

But, you know, my mom and I
are close.

Relatively functional.

Yeah, my father's practically
disowned me for coming here.

Why? Cause you left home?

He thinks the amount of debt
I'll be racking up

For a journalism degree
is irresponsible.

Hmm.

I'm the first in my family
to go to college.

Wow. Now that is legendary.

Thank you.

Yeah, I think my dad feels like
I'm judging him,

Even though he's a self-made
business man

Whom I respect the hell out of.

It still implies
they're not enough.

Yeah.

My mom is the complete opposite.

She kept saying that she'd
be fine if I took a year off,

But the more she said it...

<i>The less you believe her.</i>

Yeah.

Family is a damn minefield.

yeah.

Silver lining though,

My dad keeps me hella motivated.

And I keep my head down
and be published

Before I've even graduated.

Hmm?

But you're gonna have a little
fun on the way, right?

Yeah.

I mean I'm gonna try and embrace
the university experience.

Why?

You got big plans?


<i>â™ª</i>

Oh, hello.

Were you reaching for this?

And my hand is underneath yours.

So? I had it first.

Do you need it for class?
'cause I need it for class.

Why I need it is irrelevant.

[throat clearing]

Your hand is still on my hand.

Is this your move?

My move?

No, but, lovely accidents
do happen.

Nate Simpson.

No name?

Cold. That's cold.

I'm accidentally playing
hard to get.

<i>Riley: Olivia! Hey!</i>

Olivia, it's beautiful.

Suits you perfect.

Olivia, this is my mom.
And this is...

Nate Simpson.

Hi.

Your friend here stole
my books, so,

Now I owe her some coffee.

That's my kind of logic.

Enjoy your day.

Olivia.

Excuse me, did you just meet
a man in a bookstore,

Okay, and I'm the nerd?

He was just being nice.

Anyway, it's nice to meet you
Dr. O'connor.

Come here and give me a hug.

Thank you so much for not
letting my daughter starve

On her first night.

Okay, drama.

Olivia, are you ready to embrace
the university experience?

Mm-hmm.

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can see it all
in your eyes â™ª</i>

â™ª

<i>â™ª I can see it all
in your eyes â™ª</i>

â™ª

Hi!
Hey!

Signature mocktail?

Thank you.

A sorority lineup.
Wow.

Well, Riley is in legacy.

I was pi gamma beta.

Does that mean
you're in automatically?

It helps for sure, but,
you know,

I still have to go
through recruitment.

So step one, you apply to all
the houses you're interested in.

Step two, you attend events,

You know, try and be as
impressive as you possibly can.

If they really like you,
you're invited to step three,

Which is the bid.
Stressful.

Okay, so, really, you could
be invited to six houses

Or none at all?

Yeah, basically I've tried to
prepare for every eventuality.

Oh, I just remembered,
Rosa denude is here

And I'm a big fan of
their philanthropy work.

So, I'm gonna go.

Okay.
Okay.

I'll be back though, promise.

Sorority sister to surgeon.

That is impressive,
Dr. O'connor.

Well, I'm not really an anomaly.

I mean, let's look
at Kamala Harris, right,

All the way to
the vice presidency.

TouchÃ©, touchÃ©.

Some of the houses
are about parties but,

Most of them are filled

With very smart and ambitious
young women.

You would actually probably
fit right in.

Thank you. It's lovely
of you to say.

[phone vibrating]

Sorry, I should...

Yeah, no, go.

I'll just be over here,
reliving my youth.

Got it. Yes!

Olivia Rivera!

We were so hoping
you would show up.

Good news?

Yeah.

Sorry, do I know you?

Not yet, Olivia.
But I know you.

100,000 followers on insta.

The published expose
on your city Counsellor.

Cheating bastard.

And your Anders entrance essay
was phenomenal.

You have such a strong voice.

How in the hell did you read
my entrance essay?

Jasmine Foyle.

Current head of recruitment
for pi gamma beta.

Do you have a minute?

-Wow
-oh my.

Katherine Oâ€™Connor?

Georgia.

Wow. I thought that you were
in new york, doing pr.

Can you believe?

I am the chapter advisor
here on campus.

It's like nothing's
ever changed.

This is Paige.

The pi gamma beta secretary.

Welcome.

Hi, this is my daughter-

Riley.

Daughter of famous Dr. O'connor
is not to be forgotten.

Katherine, how would
you like to bid

On some of our auction items?

We've got spa days, four courses
at my favorite restaurant,

All for charity.

Spa day for us?

Absolutely.

Yeah, I got this.
Thanks mom.

So Paige, how long have you
been a member of-

How crazy.

We have two legacies
and two science majors

In the same place.

Riley, you and Mya are basically
the same person.

Is that a good or a bad thing?

Well it depends.

Are you good at winning
competitions, or not?

Yeah.

I'll just sign in now.
Mmmhmm.

So, you want me to join?

I'm like the least likely
sorority girl ever.

Which makes you all
the more interesting.

Yeah, I feel like you're trying
to collect me.

We're very selective

About whom we invite into the pi
gamma beta family, Olivia.

We're known for our ambition.

We pick people who will
elevate the house.

Like you.

Yeah, I just came
with a friend, so.

Riley Oâ€™Connor.

Aw, I'm freaking you out.

Oh, first days on campus
can be overwhelming

And you didn't have anyone
to tell you

What to expect, did you?

No, how..

We'll let you get your feet
under you.

But please, consider it, Olivia.

We'd love to have someone of
your caliber in pi gamma beta.

<i>Olivia: She knew things
about me,</i>

Things I do not share
on social media.

And she kept saying my name
over and over and over.

There's a psychological trick.
It builds rapport.

It means she actually liked you.

From what I hear, this jasmine
has really brought like

Pi gamma beta back
to life again.

I mean, listen, check out
its alumnus.

Okay, so, two congress women.
Mmmhmm.

An editor of the new york times.

Woah, Woah, Woah, wait.
Jill Saunders?

The documentary filmmaker?

Yeah, we're friends.

Her first film made me want
to go into journalism.

Any chance you could make
an introduction?

Hmm.

Hell week is an opportunity.
Golden hour.

Let me dig in-

To what?

The row is locked down.

You won't get anything
but dating stats and gossip.

Hi, Jamie, I'm Olivia Rivera.
I've-

Got our coveted first year
assistant gig.

You don't start until next week.

I was wondering if I could run

Some potential story ideas
by you?

Assistants don't pitch or write.

Your job will be to proof
and fact check.

So I shouldn't pursue a possible
interview with Jill Saunders?

You set that up yourself?

Mm-hmm.

I like the initiative.

But if you'd done your homework,

You'd know we ran a story
with Jill last year.

<i>Jamie: We'll set you up with
access to our back issues,</i>

<i>Then we can talk more next week.</i>

<i>Cool?</i>

Yeah.

Hey, Olivia, hold on.

Are you gonna be a problem
for me, bookstore guy?

Are you going to be a problem
for you?

The Saunders interview
was on point.

You have great instincts.

Right. Were you in that room
just a moment ago?

Jamie will let you write if you
find something undeniable.

A story only you can write.

You want to write about
hell week.

There's some rumors I think
might be worth chasing.

What kind of rumors?

Two years ago, paramedics showed
up to a house on sorority row,

Along with campus security,
and the police.

Which house?

Pi gamma beta.

Right. Of course.

Your friend's a legacy, huh?

What is she getting
herself into?

Halloween night.

<i>Nate: The story going was
the girl was badly injured</i>

<i>In some sort of accident
in the woods.</i>

<i>Apparently, dozens
of people were there,</i>

<i>But when the dust settled,
no one will talk.</i>

<i>In the end, the university
tried to pass it off</i>

<i>As a jogger injured herself.</i>

<i>Neither changed their story.</i>

How many joggers
run at midnight?

Through the woods, on Halloween?

We are going to talk
about something

Other than work after this.

Like, your family
or your school,

Or even your favorite color.

Okay.

Mmmm.

So there have been other
weird incidents at pgb.

A friend of mine was coming
down from the city

And he said he heard screaming.

Like, bloody murder
level screaming,

Coming from the house.

Did he call security?
Mm-mm.

He went and checked
on them first.

The girl who answered
the door said

She's watching a horror movie.

Creepy, but not definitive.

Am I going to regret telling
you all this?

Yellow.

Yellow?

My favorite color.

And, I went to a small
public school

That always smelt like
floor wax and gym socks.

Floor wax and gym socks, huh?

Well thank you,
thank you for sharing

That very intimate detail
with me.

I'm honored.


Thanks so much for being
my wing woman.

Situations like this are not
the easiest for me.

Hey, I'm intrigued.

I want to know, are we stealing
the declaration of independence?

Sacrificing kittens?

Thank you all for coming.

And welcome to pi gamma beta's
annual capture the flag event.

Boundaries are from the house,

Through the woods
to the main park,

Obstacle course is fair game.

And thank you to Gabriel
and his tau alpha brothers

For helping us set up.

Anything for our sisters.

<i>Jasmine: I won't say that
the woman who wins</i>

<i>Will earn their membership...</i>

Thank you.

But it certainly won't
hurt your bid.


Red team.

<i>Paige: Mya.</i>

Blue team.

Let's see who winds up on top.

It's not too tight, is it?

Woah, hey, yo frat man.

Only got one red flag.

Excuse me.

Happy hunting.

Hey baby.

â™ª


Oh!

Better run!

<i>Olivia: It's just a game.</i>

A game we're gonna win!

Come on!

I need a diversion.

You know, even at that height,
if you slip-

I'm not gonna slip.

I just need to make sure

Those blue goons
are occupied, okay?

You go that way,
I'll go this way.

Okay.

I got it!

Woo!

They're a force to be
reckoned with.

Olivia certainly is.

It was Oâ€™Connor
who got the flag.

Only cause Rivera let her.

Quite right, Mya.

I wonder what Riley would
have done on her own though.

Mya, every year there are
spiders and there are flies.

Do you want to learn how
to be a spider?

Hell yeah.

Right answer.

Focus on what you sense
around you, okay?

Smell, see, hear...


[phone vibrates]

No.

I only have an invitation
from pgb.

That's your top choice, right?

Must have done something wrong.

You didn't do anything wrong.

They dig into your life,

Social media, school transcripts
and, and extracurriculars.

Hey, hey, hey.

What if I don't get into pi
gamma beta after round two?

You will.

You are 100 percent perfect
for pi gamma.

You're Oâ€™Connor tradition!

Which makes me worried
they're gonna chose me

Because of my mother and,
and not because of me.

What, what if they, what if
they all know about my anxiety?

You don't have to keep it
a secret,

It's, it's nothing to be
ashamed of.

You're not the one who has
to experience living with it.

You know, people say exactly
that all the time

And then they stop texting.

I didn't mean to make it
sound trivial.

But I know, with certainty,
that you are worthy of pgb.

With or without your mom.

Why are you so invested anyway?

I thought you were just
my wing woman?

I may have changed my mind.

Yes!


Oh, my goodness.

This is gonna be amazing!

Ooh, hot, ladies.

Come on, man.

Both: Shut up!

How jasmine can date him
is beyond me.

He's gross.

Mm-hmm.

Gabriel is kind of cute though.

Oooh!

Stop it.

[phone vibrates]

Oh.

<i>Katherine: Hey Ri.</i>

Hey, guess who's going to go
out for pgb with me?

Only took a little arm twisting.

And a look at the fancy house.

Well, that's wonderful.

[notification alert]

See ya around, Dr. O.
Call you later.

Okay, bye!

My board is clear tomorrow,

I was thinking that
I would drive up

And maybe we could go
and have lunch.

Are you free?

Definitely.

[phone vibrates]

Mom, I'm so sorry,
I have to run.

<i>But tomorrow's great, though.</i>

Okay, love you babe.

Okay, bye!

â™ª

Hey, babe!

Hey.

I appreciated the please
in my summoning text.

Oh, it wasn't meant to be
a command.

Sure it was.

A taste of what is to come,
right?

Any rituals I should know about?

Hazing, maybe?

Oh, pi gamma beta does not
practice or condone hazing.

Period.

Why am I here, exactly?

Officially, I can't promise
a bid,

But, we do reiterate
our interest in you, Olivia.

We're hesitating when it comes
to Riley Oâ€™Connor though.

We're not sure she wants it.

She seems guarded.

Are you asking me if she has
something to hide?

Frankly, yes.

Pi gamma beta doesn't need
more damage.

Riley is not damaged.

Not what I said.

It's my job to protect
the house.

Okay, Riley is concerned

That pi gamma beta will choose
her because of her mom.

That's why she seems hesitant.

That explains a lot.

Hm.

Quite noble.

Riley's great, you'd be lucky
to have her.

And you?

You've changed your mind,

Or you wouldn't have
come running.

Yeah.

Yeah, maybe 'cause it's new
and exciting.

Maybe it's because joining
a sorority

Will further piss off my dad.

We have something
in common then.

Being here drove a wedge
between me and my family.

My sister, we don't even
talk anymore.

Oh.

Ouch.

Pi gamma beta opened my eyes
to what I was allowed to want.

They are my family now.

And they could be yours too.

And Riley's?

Where she goes I go.

You have been chosen,
and now, you must choose.

Is this even going to be safe?

The world isn't safe,

Which is why we are more
important than ever.

Take off your shoes.

The three pillars of
pi gamma beta are

Commitment, perseverance
and most importantly, trust.

Trust yourself and trust
your sisters.

Nothing is compulsory.

Choose to take steps forward
despite fear of pain.

[glass shards clinking]

Okay.

Who will take the first step?

Sorry, I'm a dancer, I can't.

Commitment, perseverance, trust.

I'll do it.

What?

This isn't what it looks like.

All right ladies.

Put your blindfolds back on.

Tory, Paige.

Step forward, Olivia Rivera,

And let us welcome you
to our family.

<i>â™ª Now you see me
come your way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª can't you see
I'm wide awake? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª See how I come your way â™ª</i>

like we'd ever let you
walk on broken glass.

Go get Riley.

<i>â™ª I walk like a wolf really â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm present
while you hide away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª and fears that you
feel through me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª now feel them
all the way â™ª</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

Here's your bid card, Mya.

â™ª

You too.

Paige: Your bid card, Riley...
Olivia.

â™ª

Good job.


No, no bid card for you.

You can go home.

You said it wasn't compulsory.

There are still consequences
to your choices.

Jasmine, please, I'm a legacy.

<i>Paige: Yep, goodbye!</i>

â™ª

Buh bye. Thank you.

And now, ladies,

A specially catered gourmet
dinner awaits us.

[clapping and cheering]

Let's eat!

<i>Nate: I'm sorry, you did
what now?</i>

You joined pi gamma beta?

Ding, ding, ding!
Correct.

I just gotta make it through
hell week.

Write a story only you
can write, right?

Well, this is it.

Secrets of a sorority.

I thought you we're going
to write about the parties,

Not actually crawl
into the viper's pit.

The row has power, Liv.

If they find out you're writing
a story-

They won't. They won't.

Okay. Keep looking at me
like that

I'll start to think you care
about me.

Newsflash, Rivera, I care.

I like you, and yes, I mean,
like you, like you.

Now you just wanted to see what
the ladies' dorms look like.

You're not taking me seriously.

I like you too.

But, you have to admit,
this is a fantastic opportunity.

Okay, how do you plan on
plundering their secrets?

Find a sister
that likes to talk.

And be my charming self.

Oh yeah, they're in
real trouble now.

<i>Jasmine: Beyond thrilled
you're all here, ladies.</i>

Unfortunately I can't stay
to give you

The usual tour of the house,

But my fellow sisters are more
than happy to do the honors.

All right, everybody
follow Paige.

This way.

Tory, why don't you take Olivia
upstairs to see the bedrooms?

I think you'll be sold once
you see them.

You're gonna love it here.

We do not have locks on any
of the doors at pi gamma beta.

Eventually you and Riley
will get my old room.

Yeah, if we make it through
the hazings, right?

We do not haze at pi gamma beta.

There are merely tests.

Do you like being a pgb?

I mean it can't be
all champagne on ice.

I wanted, want, to be a lawyer.

But, I torched all of my
high school English courses

So when I came to Anders,

That dream looked dead
as a doornail.

Jasmine arranged
for a tutor for me,

Paid for by the house,

And now law school's
back on the table.

Well...

Hey, there's a year missing,

From the group photo from 2019.

Oh, it's probably just broken.

Yeah, but there isn't even
a space for it.

It's okay, I'll ask jasmine.

Oh!

Oh mighty, you're stubborn.

The photo was removed.

Tossed storage in the basement.

Basement, why?

Because she was in it.

We're not even supposed
to say dahlia's name.

Tory?

[glass shatters]

I'll get it.

Hey, hey, wait, wait.
I'll get a vacuum.

â™ª <i>it's good,</i>
<i>when you're here</i> â™ª

[whistle blows]

<i>â™ª just don't disappear â™ª</i>

<i>Paige: Let's go!</i>

<i>â™ª I'll try, so hard â™ª</i>

<i>Paige: Come on, ladies.</i>

<i>â™ª Dance floor, encore â™ª</i>

Run!

Run!

[whistle blows]

â™ª <i>we are one</i> â™ª

â™ª

<i>Paige: Great, keep going!</i>

<i>Hey, hey, are you ok?</i>

Urgh!

What is the point of this?

I don't know.


We need a chat.

You're not impressed by our team
building exercises.

Yeah, there's a fine line
between team building

And hazing.

You're in journalism, right?

You got that freshman position
at the review?

You know, you're the first woman
in seven years to get it?

No, seriously?

Mm-hmm.

That glass ceiling has to be
broken more than once.

We're making sure
you're prepared for life.

Do you know why we're so careful

About who gets to be one of us?

To make the house as impressive
as possible?

No.

It's because this house
has to be safe.

It has to be a place where
sisters can share their fears.

Their secrets.

For now and for life.

Secrets like, I'm afraid
of flying?

Like you're a mayor running
for re-election

And you get a cancer diagnosis.

Can't tell your husband,
or your daughter, yet.

So you call your
sorority sisters.

My mom.

Paige, I'm sorry.

It's why we test, and we push.

To make sure the women of
pi gamma beta are totally in.

Now.

What?

Yo, seriously?
I can have these?

That's so nice.

You're pi gamma beta

And we don't want our ladies
to feel, or look, cheap.

Thanks.

Hm-mmm.

Hello?

â™ª

[heart thumping]

Okay.

Fresh grass.

Wood floor.

Laughter.

We're not asking
you to do anything

We haven't done ourselves.

Our limits are often mental.

Our mind lies to us.

Tells us we can't do things
that are totally possible.

no, no, I can't!

I.. I... Can't..
Can't!

Yeah!


Yeah, it hurts like hell.

I mean, I hope it's not worse
than hiking

In the freezing rain.

It's okay. I got this.

Okay.

What the hell?

oh...

Hey, Riley, Riley.
If it's too much...

Support her!

She doesn't need coddling.

no, I can't!

I can't!

Are you a little competitive,
Mya?

Uh, uh, uh. You still haven't
beat my record.

Ten minutes, fifteen seconds,
Mya.

I can't do another 10 minutes.

You're crazy.

Oh, we don't call
our sisters crazy.

Even if they are.

Down, down, down.

[breathing shakily]

[breathing shakily]

All right, Paige.

I think your point has been
aptly made.

Don't touch me!

That was your fault, bitch!

Hey, Mya, thanks
for the stickers.

Don't know what you're
talking about.

Is there something that I need
to know about?

Is Mya getting to be too much
to handle?

No.

No. I'm, I'm fine.

Good.

Then time to get warm.

All right everybody,

Let's go meet up with the boys
on the porch.

<i>[dance music]
â™ª</i>

You look like you earned this.

Oh. Thank you.

â™ª

<i>Riley: What are you doing
down here?</i>

Hi.

I thought jasmine might stash
the good snacks down here.

You're lying.

Riley.

Riley! Hey!

<i>Tory: Come on, seriously.
Get off of me.</i>

Come on.

Stop it. No.
Get off of me.

<i>Tory: Stop it. Stop it.
Stop.</i>

No.

Hey, jackass!
She said stop!

Oh, we're just fooling around.

What the hell is happening
in here?

You know how she is.

I mean, she came onto me.

No, no, that is not
what happened.

Logan was hurting Tory.

Please, I was not.

Tory?

He had me against the pillar.

Look, you can't believe them.

Obviously I do,
without question.

Now get the hell
out of my house.

Sweetie.

I am so sorry we couldn't
protect you sooner.

<i>Riley: What were you really
doing there?</i>

I was looking for a photo,

The one missing
from the stairwell.

I think one of the girls in it
got hurt.

Badly.

How do you even know that?

Well, I heard rumors.

Rumors?

You're jeopardizing both
of our places in the house

Because you heard gossip?

From a reliable source.

Pi gamma beta covered up
an accident.

I thought it might make
a good story.

A good story.

What, so, so none of this
is real?

Becoming a sister,
being my friend?

I'm just an angle now.

Obviously I'm your friend.

I wanna be here now,

I never expected to like being
a part of the house.

No, Olivia!

We made a promise to protect
the privacy of our sisters.

What are you going to do,

Start writing about
what happened to Tory?

Or what happened to me?

No.

No, please, Riley,
you can't say anything.

Riley!

Olivia and I had a fight.

And she, she lied about
something important, so.

Okay, well, did you talk to her?

Why would that help?
She lied to me.

Riley, people make mistakes.

Okay, just let me be pissed off!

I am allowed to feel things,
you know,

I don't have to be numb
in order to survive.

I'm not fragile.

Hey.

Talking to your mom does not
make you fragile, okay?

I know. I just, I just mean
that you don't always

Have to try and fix things
all the time, okay?

That's all.

I do do that, don't I?

Yes, you do.

You didn't have to be so quick
to answer that.

Yeah, okay, right.

Listen, I'm sorry.
I, I don't know.

I just don't want to be shut
out of your life.

Mom.

I'm not shutting you out.

I promise.

[phone vibrates]

Oh.

It's pi gamma beta?

Yup.

They're calling me back
to the house for an event.

I'm sorry.

It's all right. I remember
what that was like.

Listen, um, should I come back
in a couple weeks?

Maybe we try out that
new brunch place?

Yes please.

I'm not smothering you?

No, you're not smothering me.

Oh good.

Can I get pancakes and waffles,
eggs and bacon?

Yes.

And whip cream.

Yes, you may.

Thank you.

As long as you're not a brat.

Ah! When am I ever?


All right. I love you.

I love you too.

Okay.

See you in a couple weeks.

See you, mom.
Bye.

If Riley tells them
what you're doing...

Hell hath no fury like
a sorority exposed.

I'm aware.

Yes, but not just pi gamma beta.

You have evidence
of hazing already.

That is a threat to the whole
row, Liv.

It's Riley I'm more
worried about.

There's a distinct possibility
she will never trust me again.

You look into this photo
of this dahlia chick?

Yeah, she's a ghost.

No social media presence,

No archived history on the feed.

Literally, if I didn't have
that photo

I'd say she didn't even exist.

She must be a stick of dynamite,
ready to blow.

She's who the ambulance was for.

I'll ask around.

You can't erase
people's memories.

No. I don't want you
getting involved.

I already put Riley
in an awful position.

Hey, hey, hey.

You don't have to ask
for anything.

Remember that time that we
established that I like you?

This is a move, huh?

You could just take me
out to dinner.

Dinner?

I could do dinner.

What about if I cook
in my place tonight?

You cook too?

Please, remove that look
of shock and awe on your face.

I am very much a modern dude,
you know.

Oh. Okay.

â™ª

<i>Paige: Time to shake what
your momma gave you, Mya.</i>

Arms up.

Decent, but...

Oh, let's add some arm days in,
shall we?

Next.

How about you, Tory?

You've put on a few
champagne pounds.

I'm not a new member.

Oh, everybody needs a little
re-motivation when they slip.

You're not actually going
to do this, are you?

Well, I don't have any issues
with my body, so yeah.

This isn't a team building
exercise, Riley.

Look at Tory.

O'connor?

Want to prove your mental metal?

You know, you don't have
to be here, Olivia.

I know you'd much rather
be writing.

I'm here for you, idiot.

Fine.

What are you doing?

There. You shake, I shake.

Go ahead Paige, circle my flaws.


Is something's funny?

Yeah, you are, you weirdo.


Stop it, you're gonna fall off.

I'm so excited for this.

Get in my belly.

Oh, my gosh.

Look, I'm, I'm really sorry
that I lost it, earlier.

It just felt really good to be
wild and unafraid, you know?

Yeah.

Yeah, and I never should have
kept what I was doing

A secret from you.

Poking around, I'm sorry.

And I understand why you did.

I mean, I can see the headline.

Under-covering what's rotten
in the state of pi gamma beta?

There is something rotten.

I mean, like, they wrap up
all these humiliations

Like they're self-improvement.

So, we say no, draw the line.

You're ready to lose your spot?

Maybe that's the better ending
to this story.

Or, we could change things
from the inside.

You know, if we get enough
people on board,

They can't kick out all of us.

Maybe.

But, Mya might be beyond
saving though.

Mm-mm. No, it's Paige.

Paige wants me to quit

And she's using Mya
to make me do it.

Why does she want you to quit?

I don't know, 'cause to them
I'm flawed and cracked.

Hey, don't say that.

And what confuses me is

Why I even made it through
recruitment in the first place.

It doesn't matter.

We're gonna do this,
shake up the system.

Yeah, you shake, I shake, right?

Logan is too useful to lose.

The game is chug,
care to play, Olivia?

I'm guessing that's
not straight cranberry.

Well there may be a dash
of vodka.

Nothing serious.

Whoever gets it down
fastest wins.

Nah.

I'll pass.

Ugh!

â™ª <i>la la la la la la</i>

things interesting?

Hey, hey Liv.

Ah, my shoes are gone.

Where am I?

What the hell did you do to her?

It wasn't me.

It was the vodka.

Her bottles may have had
a touch more than mine.

Riley, Riley.
Please don't leave me.

No, no, no. I am not going
to leave you, honey.

You're okay.

All right, let's get you back
to your room.

Okay. I'm right here,
right here.

Okay. I'm gonna be right back
but I have to go find Mya.

All right, just rest.

[notification alert]

Could you check on her.

Riley?


Riley.


Riley!


Riley!

â™ª

<i>Riley!</i>

Riley!!

â™ª

Okay. Where the hell
is my phone?

â™ª

Ah, bingo.

â™ª

Hey.

Have you seen Riley?

Nope.

I think they went out
for breakfast.

Okay.

[notification alert]

What?


What? What, what is it?

â™ª

â™ª

Riley, no!

<i>â™ª</i>

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª

Detective Singh.

Georgia, I am
the chapter advisor.

Hi.

These are the ladies.

Ladies I am terribly sorry
for your loss this morning.

Now this might be the last thing
you want to do right now,

But I need to get a better
picture of Riley Oâ€™Connor.

The county coroner will be
making an official ruling,

But it looks pretty conclusive.

Suicide?

What can you tell me about her?

She was smart, but worked hard.

University hadn't been easy.

<i>Paige: She really struggled
with anxiety.</i>

<i>She took medication for it.</i>

So you did know about that?

Riley opened up to us about it
not long ago.

<i>But we all saw the signs.</i>

You've been worried about her,

That's why you were so
protective, wasn't it?

What time did Riley go back
to her dorm last night?

I, I don't remember.

<i>9:00 pm.</i>

<i>It was a normal night.</i>

Yeah, normal except
for the party.

What party, Olivia?

There was a party,
Logan was here,

Paige and I chugged
cranberry and vodka.

Logan and I broke up, Olivia,
remember?

He hasn't been here since.

And we chugged
straight cranberry.

Zero sugar makes it so sour,
but it doesn't do any harm.

Hey, if you and Riley drank in
your dorms it's your business.

She won't get in trouble
for underaged drinking?

That's not what I'm after,
right now.

<i>Detective Singh:
Did Riley drink?</i>

No, no, no way.

She put me to bed and then,

Then she told me that she was
going to go find Mya.

That's not possible,

Mya went home yesterday morning
after the group event.

She wasn't even on campus
last night.

Sweetie, I think
you're confused.

I don't, I don't, I don't
remember, I'm sorry.

I can't, I can't do this.

I need a break.

â™ª

[Katherine sobbing]

It's me.

I'd just like to be alone,
please.

I can wait outside, if you want.

No, you can stay.

I'm used to being
on the other side,

You know, the person...

Giving good news, bad news.
Hold their hand.

Being on this side, just...

I feel lost.

When Riley's dad died...

I had to take care of her,
but now it's like I have...

Did she tell you she was
stopping her medication?

No.

Riley wouldn't do that without
talking to you or her doctors.

Well I found pills in
the bathroom on the floor

And the bottle was empty.

I don't.

I don't understand.

I guess mental health
is very complex.

Even for somebody like Riley.

No.

No what, Liv?

No.

No. She didn't,
Riley didn't jump.

I don't know what happened
but Riley did not jump.

<i>â™ª</i>

Katherine, Paige lied about
that night, about the party.

Something happened
during the time that I lost.

Riley did not take her own life.

The coroner was conclusive.

I just, I'm, I missed the signs.

I'm not talking
about missed signs,

I'm talking about a cover up.

Just stop.

Enough.

I get that you are grieving,

And if you need to blame
someone, I'm it.

No. Riley loved you.

And you know 100 percent
she'd be friggen furious

If she heard you saying that you
were to blame for her brain...

Stop!

And you know...

Just stop.

Please.

Look, someone knows
what happened.

Liv, pgb does not break rank.

No.

They keep their secrets close.

That's why I'm moving
into the house.

â™ª

Come on.

<i>Georgia: Katherine.</i>

I heard the service at
the funeral was beautiful.

Did you get my flowers?

Yes. Um,

I would like to question
pi gamma beta.

Question? About what?

The possibility of Riley
being hazed.

It is university policy
to shut down any house

That engages in hazing.

I don't ask this lightly.

It's a very significant
accusation.

It's a pretty significant issue,
Georgia.

Of course.

It's just... It wouldn't
happen in that house.

Not with jasmine at the head.

She was bullied in her
first year here.

So then she should understand
why I need to talk to them.

Okay, well if it's something
that you think will help you.

Yes.

Let's go talk to the girls.

Thank you.

<i>Georgia: I know that
you're all grieving,</i>

But Riley's mother has a very
serious question to ask you all.

And it is very important

That you answer as truthfully
as possible.

<i>Georgia: Was Riley Oâ€™Connor
being hazed?</i>

<i>Now, as you all are
no doubt aware,</i>

Hazing threatens the entire
Greek way of life,

And your futures.

None of you have to answer
right now,

Okay, we can speak
to you individually.

Oh, that won't be necessary.

I disagree.

I mean there's no way
to protect..

Everyone will speak the truth,
Mrs. O'connor.

Won't we, ladies?

So, were any of you ever hazed?

Forced to do anything that
you are uncomfortable with?

Tory?

No, ma'am.

Listen, I know that this
is uncomfortable,

Okay, and I sympathize with you,

Just remember, I'm one of you.

I... I loved this house too,

But my daughter is dead
and there are holes missing

In my understanding
of what happened.

She was sick, wasn't she?

Riley had a generalized
anxiety disorder

And in my opinion
was not unstable.

Well, maybe she stopped taking
her meds?

You wouldn't necessarily know
if she had, would you?

We're all upset,
Dr. O'connor,

But we weren't there
when Riley died

And there was no hazing.

<i>Jasmine: Surely you've
spoken with Olivia?</i>

<i>She and Riley were so close.</i>

<i>Miss Rivera?</i>

What do you have to say?

No. It's exactly like I told
you, Dr. O'connor.

There has been no hazing
in pi gamma beta.

<i>She asked us about hazing
in front of everyone.</i>

It was a friggen joke.

It's not just the house
than wants this buried,

It's Georgia, it's the whole
friggen system.

<i>Nate: Where are you?</i>

I'm in the bathroom.

I don't know when I'll be
allowed to leave this place.

[phone vibrates]

Holy crap. Someone
just dm'd me.

"I knew dahlia, pi gamma beta
not safe for you."

<i>Nate: Who is it from?</i>

It's a fake name.

Argonaut 777.

They want to meet me.

<i>Nate: Does that matter now?</i>

<i>With Riley...</i>

Finding out what happened to
dahlia might give me leverage.

If they went through all that
trouble to bury the story...

[muffled voice]

I'm gonna go for a run
and just think this through.

Paige!

Can I help you?

Just checking on you.

Glad you were a team
player today.

Do you know whether Dr. O'connor
is gonna keep causing problems?

She is just grieving.

Right.

Yeah, well her paranoia could
affect all our futures, so.

We've decided that no one
should speak to her anymore,

Including you.

Can you handle that?

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

Great.

I'm gonna be right back
but I have to go find Mya,

All right, just rest.

â™ª

â™ª

Mya.

Find Mya.

Who's Mya?

She's another new member,
she was Riley's rival, kinda.

Jasmine and Paige swear she
wasn't at the party but she was.

I know it.

Okay, listen to me,

Georgia said something
about jasmine being bullied

In her first year.

I'm starting to think that maybe
she's being manipulated,

And the girl, the girl who knows
Riley's medications.

Paige.

<i>Yes. Paige.</i>

Just stay away from her.

Okay?

Be really, really careful.

She thinks she's untouchable
and that's super dangerous.

<i>Katherine: Be careful,
Olivia, please.</i>

Katherine, I'm sorry,

You're gonna have to make an
appointment with my secretary.

Your questioning of the girls
was a joke.

Darling, they all agreed.

Olivia Rivera even said,
there was no hazing.

Clear as a bell.

Stop it. There is no anonymity.

All right, no protection.

You intimidated them the minute
that you walked in the door.

I was simply reminding them of
the stakes involved, Katherine.

What stakes?

And stakes for who, you?

I mean, my memory of our time
at pi gamma,

It must be faulty,
or at least narrow, right.

I mean, I was so busy
with my studies

That I didn't ask Jill why
she cried herself to sleep
every single night.

Or why your friend Stacey lost
20 lbs in the first semester.

Pi gamma beta was a
positive influence.

Stacey is a corporate
lawyer now.

You don't have to be a size
0 to be an attorney.

Katherine...

I'm starting to think that
you need to speak

To someone professional.

I do, I need to speak to Mya,

She was a new member
just like Riley.

I already set up a meet
with the girls.

I don't want to interrupt
their schedules anymore.

Okay. Mya wasn't there.

Conveniently.

And for some strange reason,

All of pi gamma beta's numbers
are deleted from Riley's phone.

It just sounds paranoid.

I am not paranoid.

I am a mother.

Well, you know that I can't give
sisters' contact information.

Riley's gone because
she killed herself.

Now, we intend to give a sizable
donation in Riley's name

For the study of
bipolar disorder.

<i>We do mourn her, Katherine.</i>

She was not bipolar!

She had an anxiety disorder

And if you cared at all
you would know that.

Bitch!

â™ª

â™ª

[panicked breathing]

Help! Help!


Help!

Come on! Go! Go!


Help!

Livy?

What's wrong, are you okay?

What's up with her?

Someone, two guys in hoodies,
they were following me.

Hey, assholes!

Scaring women isn't funny.

Next time hang around
and see what happens, yeah?

Idiots.

They probably just wanted
to rile you up

And then ask you out
or something.

I'll make you some tea, okay?

You need something
hot and sweet.

Okay?

You know you could have
called us.

Okay?

Remember.

Anyone who threatens pi gamma
beta gets dealt with.

Threaten our family and there
are consequences.

Always.

Come on.

â™ª

<i>Paige: I still don't trust her,
she's...</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

<i>Paige: I forgot my phone,
I'll be back.</i>

Hi Mya, I'm doctor Connor.

I know you.

Yeah, I was here earlier.
You were pretty groggy.

Um, do you want to tell me
what happened?

Um, I slipped, going down
the stairs at my parents place.

They were out of town.

I broke two fingers
and tore a tendon.

Yeah, that must be pretty scary.

No, being here,
stuck waiting is worse.

Doctor Connor, you're needed
outside, stat.

Doctor Oâ€™Connor,
not doctor Connor.

You know, Mya, the truth
doesn't stay buried for long.

You might want to consider that.

[breathing shakily]

Hey, sweetie.

She's lying about her injuries.

How do you know?

So the chart says that she had
a significant amount of alcohol

In her blood stream and the
doctors had to remove splinters

From her left shin.

She went up the wall too.

Yeah.

She came down alive.

What the hell did they do
to my daughter?

Riley used to climb
all the time.

There was no way that she
would climb without safety gear.

Mya didn't like her.

She saw her has a rival.

I'm gonna call detective Singh
and just tell her what we found.

Katherine, they didn't just go
out for a climb.

One of them, jasmine or Paige,

They were there and they put
them up to it.

They're not gonna
let anyone talk

And if no one talks
we have nothing.

No proof.

Well there's no way that Mya
is gonna keep my visit a secret.

Olivia, we gotta get you
out of the house, okay?

It's time.

[phone vibrates]

Woah.

Gabriel?

Olivia.

This is dahlia.

Dahlia Foyle.

Jasmine's sister?

You're Riley's mom.
Aren't you?

They watch you.

They meaning pi gamma?

Clearly you've been asking
the right questions.

Somehow that's not really
a comfort.

We shouldn't be doing this.

Gabe.

It is the right thing to do.

Gabriel heard this guy Nate
asking around about me.

Realized he was your boyfriend.

You're both with<i> the review?</i>

Why are you digging?

Is it just for a story?

Social media?

No. No, it started
as a story.

Now it's about the truth.

I don't think my friend, Riley,
took her own life.

I think pgb made it
look that way.

Olivia has this theory
about pi gamma and hazing

And you were a part of it.

You got hurt, didn't you?

And jasmine covered it up.

Neither of us knows what
happened to Riley, okay?

But we do know what happened
on Halloween 2019.

I was chapter president,

Jasmine and I were competitive,
so similar.

We had to distinguish ourselves.

So, I took advantage
during a hazing.

<i>Mystery sister: Uh, uh uh.</i>

<i>Remove that blinder
and it's all over, bitch.</i>

<i>Go ahead, we don't want
your brand anyway.</i>

<i>Quitter.</i>

ahhhh!!!!!

<i>Dahlia: She broke her leg.</i>

Dahlia called an ambulance

But jasmine lied about
how she did it.

I was ready to confess
everything.

So she buried her own hazing?

She said "I shouldn't make
the house pay for my mistake."

Always protect the family, but
she threw you under the bus.

She made it look like
it was just me.

That I bullied her
because she was my sister.

Pgb sent tau alpha
to intimidate you.

You were one of the dudes
in the hoodies?

I'm sorry.

Gabriel has a full ride
on a football scholarship.

No one is gonna know
that we spoke.

Olivia is very good at
protecting her sources.

And thank you, for doing right
by Riley and me.

Let's get you out of here, now.

Definitely.

I'll be two minutes.

Cool.

Hey!

<i>Logan: We got her.</i>

<i>Get rid of Nate!</i>

<i>Pull over!</i>

Come on! Come on!!
Hey!

What are you doing, man?

This isn't part of the plan.

You've been digging around
in pi gamma beta business

That isn't yours.

Ah!

Logan, I don't even need
to see you to know it's you.

You are such a lapdog.

<i>Logan: Shut up!</i>

I'm talking.

Tell slowly!

What, was I getting too close?

Maybe you're more involved
than I thought.

All we were supposed to do
is scare you.

I think you deserve
a little more.

Ahh!

Come on, come on!
Bitch!

Let's go.

Let's go.

Go, go, go.

Get in the van!

Have a nice walk!

Ahh!

<i>Come on.</i>

<i>Katherine: There she is.</i>

Help.

Olivia, oh my god.

Are you okay?

Is anything broken?

nothing's broken.

How'd you find me?

Gabriel texted.

He said that you'd been dumped
and abandoned out here.

Okay, this is, this is it.

We're handing it over
to the police.

No, no, no. No.

Olivia!

You're in real danger.

Actual bodily harm
got sustained.

They did everything
I needed them to.

Now I know pi gamma beta
is scared

And when you're scared,
you make mistakes.

They just made a big one.

We'll talk about this.

<i>Jasmine: Paige, you back?</i>

I think they're all out
at the movies.

Just me.

What are you doing, sitting
here in the dark like a freak?

I was taking a breather.

Recovering from that one time
when I was abducted.

Tossed out of a van.

Oh my god, Olivia,
what happened?

I know about dahlia.

She was your own sister
and you used her mistake,

A hazing gone wrong,
a broken leg,

To get her kicked out
of the house.

Dahlia was stupid.

She panicked.

Called an ambulance.

I saved the house
by covering up,

Which is what she should
have done.

And now you're
covering up again.

Riley did not go up
that wall by herself.

Honey, we will never know
exactly what happened.

Because, you'll never tell.

Except your boy Logan,
he's not as smart as you.

[clears throat]

<i>You've been digging around
in pi gamma beta business</i>

<i>That isn't yours.</i>

Aw.

And I also gave him a good
raking with my nails.

Police will have no trouble
identifying him.

Exactly what do you want,
Olivia?

The truth.

Or, I post all of that,
a 100,000 followers

Are gonna know that
your boyfriend is a psycho.

Okay.

Okay.

Riley came back from putting
you to bed

Then Mya and Riley played
some truth or dare game.

Mya messed with Riley's head

And got Riley to admit
to being mentally ill.

Liar.

Riley was fragile, Olivia.

She took her own life, okay,

Just because you
don't like that,

It doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

Mya had broken fingers,
torn tendons,

Injuries suffered by climbers
all the time.

She went up that wall too,
jasmine.

Oh god.

It was an accident.

An accident?

Paige egged them on.

And they were drunk and tired.

Mya made it up and down again.

Riley didn't.

So Paige made it look like
a suicide

And by the time I found out
about it, it was too late.

Olivia, I am so sorry.

Bitch.

You're not the only one who can
pit people against each other.

Paige, uh, how long have
you been there?

Long enough to hear
you stab me in the back.

If you won't tell the whole
truth, I will.

I put them up to it.

I challenged Mya to climb
all the way up.

I've climbed it before, I just,
I don't like heights.

You're scared.

Riley knows all about that.

Referring to my anxiety?

Calling it scared is inaccurate,
and frankly ignorant.

Careful, Riley, we might
start to think

That you have a back bone.

You have no rope,
and you've been drinking.

Do not get up that wall.

Please.

Don't you want to overcome
your fears?

There's a big difference
between overcoming her fears

And doing something
completely stupid and unsafe.

Mya? Mya.

You go up that wall or
you're out of the house.

You know what, Riley
can do it with you.

She clearly knows
what she's talking about.

Good idea.

No.

<i>Riley: Don't.</i>

<i>Paige: Aww. Whaa!</i>

Mya, stop!

Good girl!


There's one right there.

ah!!! Ah!!!

[jasmine & Paige laughing]

Come on, Mya!

Always forward, always up!

Look, you know what,
find your footing.

There's a hold right there.

I can't move.

I'm hurt, my wrist.

Oh, don't be a little bitch,
Mya.

You have to climb,
you're almost all the way up.

Shut up, okay!

She's frozen, she's done.

Look at her!

She's not going anywhere.

Yelling at her is not
going to help.

[jasmine & Paige laughing]

Oh god, I might throw up.

Deep breaths, all right?

in.

out.

Up the wall or out of the house,
Mya.

We need you to put
your left shoulder on
my right shoulder, okay?

And I'm gonna support you and
we're gonna do this together.

We're sisters, okay?

You got me?

Yeah, I got you.

Good.

Okay.

Good.

We're almost there.

Keep going.
Okay.

Keep going.

<i>Riley: Remember to breath.</i>

<i>You're almost there, Mya.</i>

<i>You can do it.</i>

When you get up there,

I really need you
to not panic, Mya.

<i>Find your footing, okay?</i>

Mya!

ahh!!!

Riley landed and I knew,
from the sound, from the...

I knew.

Did you try CPR?

Did you check for a pulse?

I thought if we touched her they
would know it wasn't a suicide.

<i>Paige: Well give her CPR,
she could be unconscious!</i>

Look, do something!

She's dead, Paige!

Look at her head!

Paige: Dead?

Jasmine: No, no,
no, no, no, no.

Just try!

If I try, I'll leave bruises.

And they'll know what you did.

What Mya did.

What are you even saying?

Up the wall or out of the house,
that's what you said, Paige.

And Mya... Mya kicked her.

They'll say you're
both culpable.

this can't be happening.

No.

It's not happening.

Listen to me, we were
never here.

<i>Katherine: If you'd just done
the right thing,</i>

If you'd just called
an ambulance.

My priority was the house.

I fought so hard to restore
its reputation.

If a stupid prank
torpedoed us...

A prank?

It wasn't a prank, jasmine.

You manipulated a drunk,

Vulnerable sister into climbing
a two-story wall.

Pgb is the only place I belong.

Please.

I protected my sisters.

Not all of them.

Then again, you never really saw
Riley as a sister.

She never would have made it.

You never deserved
to make that call.

<i>â™ª</i>

I can't believe she's been gone
a month.

You know, next year pi gamma
beta will be full again.

New faces.

Same friggen system.

â™ª <i>they're pretending</i>
<i>not to notice</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>and we're pretending</i>
<i>to be disciplined again</i> â™ª

Hey.
Hey.

They've taken down the pi gamma
beta signs and colors.

But they'll just replace it
with something new.

Yeah, as Georgia said,

Burn down all the crops
for one bad seed.

After all, young women's futures
are at stake.

What about Riley's future?

Dahlia's future.

My future.

You can't let this cloud
the rest of your life.

Do you think it's possible
to change a whole system?

I don't know.

Riley changed me.

She changed me too.

She stood up for me.

Both of you did.

And if we can change,
all of it can change.

I believe that.

Riley saved my life,
even though I,

I made her life miserable.

You did not make her
life miserable.

You tried, but you
didn't succeed.

She was happy.

Still a force.

Yeah, she was.

I don't really know
what to do now.

You forgive yourself.

And you live.

You all forgive yourselves.

If change is going to happen,
it's gonna start with you.

â™ª <i>what are we to do,</i> â™ª

â™ª <i>we're hungry</i>
