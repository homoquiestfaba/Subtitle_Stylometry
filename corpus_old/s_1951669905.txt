Do you have any idea
how many civil codes you just broke?

You know, you and l
are gonna have some problems

if you plan on loafing around again all summer
like you did last year.

You follow me?

You understand?

Yes, sir.

You know,
when I was your age,

I worked two jobs
in the summertime.

I cut grass, and I worked
in a movie theater at night.

What the hell is your problem?

I don't have a lawnmower.

Well, you know,
that's a good point.

But it doesn't give you
any excuse to break the law.

This is your last warning.

You understand?

Yes, sir.

All right.

Hey, how fast?

35.

Kevin, aren't you
forgetting something?

All right.

What's he doing back in here?

Listen, we've got
some very good news.

Sam's cousin in California
runs an orange grove,

and they're looking for some help.

That's perfect! Sam needs a job.

Little smart ass.

The job is not for him.

We've already
made arrangements.

Mom, I'm not spending my whole summer
picking oranges

while he sits around.

Sam's gonna move back in.

Thought it would
make things easier.

Easier if I wasn't here.

You call me when you get there?

Hey! Come on, come on.
End of the line, pal.

Come on.

Hey.

I'm Kevin.

I'm Kevin.

Kevin?

Got a lot of deliveries to make.

Let's go.

What is this place?

Make it quick.
We got four more stops.

Hey, hey, hey! Hurry up!

Hey! Got hot stuff coming through,

coming through, coming through,
coming through, coming through.

Hey, just put it in the corner, man.

Dude! Come on!

What?

Just give me another chance!

I gave you a chance.
You blew it.

I'll try harder.

Take your crap
and get down the road.

You are stupid. You are slow.

We spend half our time
waiting for you to do the work

and the other half
fixing your mistakes.

You want to dick around all day,
do it on your own time.

What are you looking at?

You gonna stand around all day?
Bring that crate inside.

What?

Punk.

Hold it.

What?

Stop the truck.
Yeah. Stop the truck.

You gotta take a leak?

No.

We don't have time for screwing around.
Get back in the truck.

Sorry, dude.

What am I gonna tell the boss?

Uh, tell him...

Tell him whatever you want.

Hey. Excuse me.

What?

That kid left this.

Yeah. Set it on the table.

Is there something else?

No.

Look, I was just wondering if--

Spit it out, junior.

In case you haven't noticed, we're busy.

I don't got all day.

I was just thinking
I could use a job,

and from the looks of it,
you're short-handed.

You want to wash the dishes?

Yeah.

I don't think so.

The last thing I need
is another punk kid

messing around
in my kitchen.

As you can see,
I got plenty of those.

I'm a hard worker.

Yeah? Weren't you stacking oranges
1 0 minutes ago?

Yeah.

You quit?

Yeah.

Just like that?

Yeah.

So let me get this straight.

You want me to hire you,

knowing that you just walked off
your last job with no notice,

you want to come here
and wash dishes,

and you've never
washed a dish before.

Yeah.

I don't think so.

I don't know what to tell you. Sorry.

Hey!

All right, but if you screw up,

you're out on your ass, you got it?

Wear these unless you
want to get blisters.

Come on, while there's still some daylight.

Let's hit it.

Dustpan behind you, man.

What's your name?

Kevin.

Kevin. Lock up when
you're finished, right?

Uh, sure.

Good. I'm J. D. This is Cooper.

Don't let the tattoos fool you.

He went to an all-Catholic boys' school.

This here is Martinez.

Don't bother talking to him.

He doesn't speak any English.

Waste of your time.

Get a bunk with us.
Cabin number 8.

We'd love to help you clean up,

but we've got a date
with the street course.

So what are the rules
about skating?

Only when your work
is finished.

By the looks of this, you'll be done sometime
around Christmas.

Oh, a couple of things. 1--

Tony gets pissed
when you don't finish your work.

'Cause Tony don't skate. 2--

Don't piss off Tony.

Uh, look, rumor has it
he has a bit of a short fuse.

He was a Hell's Angel.

Right.

He almost killed a guy.

Beat him to death
for 10 bucks.

He stabbed him...
12 times?

No, no, no. This is
what really happened.

He burnt the guy's house down
while he was still in it.

Then, when he went to prison,
Tony got stabbed 12 times.

Whoa! Well, maybe you're right.

I know.

So, hey, by the way,

what'd the last kid do to get fired?

Broke some dishes.

Oh! Ow! What time is it?

Almost 6.
You better hurry up.

Tony hates people being late almost as much
as he hates being called Tony.

Why didn't you wake me?

We wanted to,
but Martinez said to let you sleep.

Hit the showers.
They're across the way.

You'll be fine.
See you at the office.

Hey, he hates
being called Tony?

Yeah. That's another thing.

You should always
address him with respect.

What do I call him?

Chief Tony.
He's a quarter Cherokee.

Really?
Yeah.

Go! He'll get pissed. Go!

Hey, that's messed up.

What?
Nothing.

No. Nothing. Go.

Not funny.

Not funny!

Not funny at all!

You must be new here.
Welcome.

Thanks. I'm late.

All right. See you around.

Yeah.

You're unraveling.

Bye!

Can I have my clothes
back, please?

Seriously, this is so not cool.

Hey, you better hurry.

He'll be back here
any monute.

Check your forehead.

Huh?
Look.

Let's go!
I'm gonna need those dishes!

Hey, come on.
Breakfast rush starts in an hour.

You gonna wear a shirt today?

Uh, yes, sir, Chief Tony.

What'd you call me?

Yes, sir.

The name's Tony. Let's go!

That's not funny.

Nice save.

Thanks, man, thanks.

Can I get my clothes back?

Sure, but one thing. Here. Check this out.

I need you to taste this.

Too much roughage in that.

Can I have your attention, please?

Can I have your
attention, please?

Now, before I cut you loose today,

I'd like to address the problem

concerning the recent rash
of curfew violations.

All campers are to be in their bunks--
their own bunks--

by 1 0 p. m. No exceptions.

Wilson.

I'm looking at you.

Also, to the individual
or individuals

responsible for abducting
the ducks from the pond

and putting them in the girls' toilets,

you are to cease and desist immediately.

The last thing we need
is another animal rights violation.

And, for those of you
who don't know,

we recently lost a beloved member of our staff,

so if I could ask you
to observe a moment of silence

for Nurse Betty Kaplan.

About time.

Thank you.

And now, on a happier note,

I will introduce the newest
member of our staff,

Nurse Hatcher.

Okay.

Eyes front, gentlemen.

It's not polite to stare.

Any questions?

Is she single?

Finally, I would
like to announce

that our annual field trip this year

will be to Magic Mountain
on July 24th.

And remember, safety first.

Nurse Hatcher.

Hey, man, that's Brad Malone.

He's one of the best amateur skaters
in the whole country.

Yeah, but he's also a bitch.

You're just jealous.

Yeah. Whatever you say, man.

I'm telling you,
the dude's a punk.

Go ahead and
introduce yourself.

Maybe he'll let you
polish his helmet.

Oh, okay.

Whatever.

Hey, you're Brad Malone, right?

Yeah.

Hey, man, I saw you skate
at Burnside last year.

You want my autograph
or something?

No. I just came to meet you.

You're new here, right?

Yeah.

Couldn't pay me enough
to work in the kitchen.

It's not so bad.

Is it true what they say about Tony?
Was he a hitman for the FBl?

I don't know.

No, man. He didn't
work for the Feds.

He did time in a federal prison.

He used to work in the kitchen.

That's how he
learned how to cook.

I wish I could sit
around and chat all day,

but I got some other
kids waiting for me.

You mind taking that for me?

Come on, guys.

So, he's such
a cool guy, isn't he?

Oh, man!

You havin' fun?

God!

Hey, guys, enough
of the lip flap here.

Get that stuff in the kitchen and get it done.

You all right?

I think so.

Yeah? All right.

Let me see.
Can you stand up?

You need some elbow pads, too.

You're gonna
have one down there.

Let's go see the nurse,
get you fixed up.

That was a pretty sticky rail.

Now, what you gotta do
on something like that

is stay centered over the board,
keep your knees bent a little bit.

Next time, I'll bet you nail it.

Aren't you Tony from the kitchen?

Yep.

Aren't you
supposed to be mean?

I am.

Now, what seems
to be the problem?

Well, he's got a scrape.
Looks pretty bad.

I hope you got a sharp knife.

This thing may have
to come off at the knee.

Thank you, doctor.

Why don't you come with me?

You finished?

Almost.

Hey, where is everyone?

Probably getting a quick
session before dinner.

You coming?

Sure.

Let's get out of here.

Be there in a minute.

Hey, where the hell you going?

To get a quick session in.

I thought I made it clear:
no skating till the dishes are done.

My work is done.

Look, you got time to skate,
you got time to work.

It's not mine.

Hey, the car out back,
make it shine.

You want me to wash your car?

Yeah.

Sweet ride, man.

It's the boss'.

Ah, Fort Knox.
Is Tony around?

I don't know, man.
I guess he's around here somewhere.

Well, if you see him,
tell him Andy said hello.

Have a good one.

Fort Knox. Sweet car.

Hey, where you been?
You missed it.

Missed what?

Andy Mac killing the vert ramp.

You should have seen him, man.
He was sick.

Yeah, man, I would have been there, but, uh...

Don't worry about it.

What?

What's on your face, huh?

Where?

Under your nose.
What's on your face?

Where?

I don't know, man. That looks like a buttstache.

What do you think,
Martinez?

That look like
a buttstache to you?

What's a buttstache?

Oh! Dude!

Hey, man, my bad.

Hey, what the hell
are you doing, huh?

Ain't you got
some dishes to wash?

Man, I'm sorry. Dude, it was an accident.

What are you skating
here for, anyway?

Hey, he said he was sorry, man.

Why don't you let it go?

What are you gonna
do about it, punk?

Yeah. What are you gonna
do about it, punk?

How about I take your boyfriend's
skateboard here

and beat your ass with it?

You girls done?
You finished?

Yeah, we're done.

Let's go.

Come on.

Come on. Let's go.

Her name's Cassidy.

Yeah. We met. Sort of.

She's hot. You should go talk to her.

You don't think
she has a boyfriend?

She's been single for as long
as I've known her.

If I wasn't so faithful
to my girl in Texas

and another girl in Colorado, l'd--

Yeah, whatever.

Dude, if you don't, I will.

Yeah.

You think I should?

What have you got to lose?

Yeah.

There's your cue.

Help her!

Right. Right.

Hey, you think
we should tell him?

What for?

Oh, my God.

Need some help?

Yeah. Thanks.

I didn't recognize you
with clothes on.

Yeah, they got a rule
about nudity here.

Too bad. I miss the whole,
like, toilet paper look.

It was good.

It was good, but it's
kind of out of season.

You got a name?

Kevin.

Well, Kevin, I gotta take this up to the store.

Want to give me a hand?

Of course.

Okay. Close up the trunk.

Yeah.

Go in, Kevin!
You can do it!

We have faith in you!

Go!

Come on, man!

All right. Let's go.

All right.

Sweet ride.

Thanks.

I've got some real, like, bad-ass rims on her.

Yeah. Let's go
catch some air.

Ready?

Yeah.

Thanks for the help.

No problem.

I'm Cassidy, by the way.

I didn't tell you that before.

I knew that already.

You did? Okay.

So, uh, how do you like it here?

I'm getting used to it. Yeah.

Some of the counselors
are a little cold.

Yeah. Some of the counselors
are egomaniacs.

What about the dishdogz?

Interesting. Exhausting.

Yeah. They're definitely
a colorful group.

Yeah.

Yeah. Actually,
I've been so busy,

I haven't even really had a chance
to take a look at the place.

Really? Well, I'm gonna take you
to a cool little spot up here.

This is pretty cool.

I know. You can see
the whole camp.

Yeah. It's great.

You think it's true
what they say about Tony?

I don't know. I mean, which one?

The one that he was a former drug dealer
for the Grateful Dead,

or that he spent time
in prison for murder,

or--my favorite one--

that he wrestled bears in Alaska?

So, I don't know.

I haven't heard those.

Yeah. I have a feeling
he likes to hear those rumors grow.

Yeah. He's a hard guy
to get to know.

So what about you?

I'm from a small town
in New Mexico.

You probably never heard of it.

I don't know. You?

Up the road a ways in Los Angeles.

I'm going to school in the fall.

What about you?

Any plans after camp?

School?

No, not really. I mean, I just--

I'd stay here
as long as they'd let me.

I'd be a counselor. You know...

I don't know.

I used to want to be a pro skater.

Yeah.

But I don't know.
Something will come up sooner or later.

Yeah. It'll just find you.

Yeah.

C., did lover boy pop up yet?

No. I haven't seen him
since he took off with Cassidy.

I hope Tony doesn't
freak on him, man.

Okay. All right.

I must say it was a pleasure
doing your job for you, lady.

Well, thank you.

So... I'll see you around?

Absolutely.

All right.

Cassidy, what are you doing?

Are you following me?

Don't tell me you're hanging out with this guy.

Whoa. Is everything all right?

Mind your own business,
dish boy.

Hey, Malone, look.

Can you just leave?
Okay? What do you want?

I thought we had something.

We did have something,

until I found out you had something
with Julie Blackwell,

Liz Hanson, Cindy Markel--
you want me to go on?

I did that for us.

You told me I needed to be sure
you were the one.

I had to test the waters.

Nice try.

Just give me another chance.

No way. Stop.

Okay. If that's
the way you want it.

I'll see you around.

All right.

Whoa. That guy's got a problem.

Sorry.

Go to work.
I'll see you later.

Thanks.
Bye.

What's up?

How was your date?

That wasn't cool.

What's wrong? You didn't hook up with her?
What happened?

No. You guys set me up.

Would we do
a thing like that?

Yeah. You knew Cassidy and Malone
had a thing.

Listen. Screw that guy.

He's a dog in the bad sense of the word.

Yeah, but I'm not trying to start--

Don't worry about it.
You're a dishdog now.

Hey, hey. What are you guys doing
standing around?

Where's your apron?

Oh, you know what?
I forgot mine.

Kevin lent me his.

Uh-huh. What about the dishes? They done?

Floor mopped?
You could eat off of it.

All right. Let's go eat.

What's he saying?

We got your back. Let's go eat.

We're not home now,
so please leave us a message.

Hey, Mom, it's me.

I guess you're sleeping
or something.

Just wanted to let you know
that I got a new job.

I'm not working
at the orange grove anymore.

Everything's fine. I'm fine.

So...

So I guess I'll just
try you again later.

Hey, is that Ryan Sheckler?

No, no way that's--

What do you know?

Come on, that's Ryan Sheckler.

Listen, Sheckles and l
go way back. It's not him.

How could you go way back?
The kid's only 1 4.

Listen, he's much taller
in person. Watch.

He is in person, you idiot.

What's up, guys?

Hey!
What's up?

You guys know where
the skate park's at?

Down that way.

Awesome.

Hey, hold up. You're
Ryan Sheckler, right?

Yeah, man.

Yeah, dude.

What's you guys' names?

Kevin.

Cooper.

Martinez.
Hey. J. D. How's it going?

So, nice to meet you guys.

Awesome. I'll see
you guys around.

Yeah, definitely.
Cool.

All right. Later.

Okay, everyone. Your attention.

First off, to the
responsible parties

who have abducted my bunk
and placed it in a tree,

I would ask for its swift return,
no questions asked.

And as for those photographs that have been
circulating around camp,

I can assure you, they have been
doctored and are completely fake.

I have never owned a donkey,

nor would I condone
any such interspecies activity.

Now, with that out of the way,

Nurse Hatcher has been treating
a rash of sunburns lately.

Not that we are in
any way responsible.

Clearly an act of God.

Nonetheless, we would recommend
a liberal dose of sunscreen

applied to the face,
arms, and legs.

I will now turn the floor
over to Nurse Hatcher,

who will demonstrate.

Nurse Hatcher, please.

Move it or lose it!

As you guys can see...

application is extremely important.

Be sure and cover
all exposed areas.

Okay. I think we get the point, Nurse Hatcher.

Thank you.

Just a quick reminder
that our annual field trip is Saturday.

And we have a special surprise
for you after your meal.

Ryan Sheckler is with us today,

and he will be doing a demonstration
on the street course.

Nurse Hatcher.

Sometimes you gotta let 'em go.

Dude, what do you
know about girls?

Hey, I've been in love.

Girls in magazines don't count.
Oh.

Dude, you gotta get over her.

You're depressing me.

Check it out.
Let me tell you a joke.

Your jokes are lame.

Dude, I'm trying to cheer you up.

So this horse walks into a bar,

and the bartender says,
"Why the long face?" And the--

Briggs, seriously, that joke sucks.

I don't get it.

It's a horse. His face is long.

No, no, I get that part,

but what kind of bar
allows horses?

Dude, that was my food!

Oh, yeah!

Get him!

Food fight!

Hostile bogey. Do we have--

Do we have permission
to engage the enemy? Do we have--

We are taking fire.
Do we have permission to exchange fire?

Do we have permission
to engage the enemy?

Sir, are you listening?

We're going down!

This is disgusting.

Man, I hope I see Malone outside.

Looks to me like you guys
got some work to do.

What about the demo?
What about it?

You know the rules. Nobody goes anywhere
till this place is cleaned up.

That's bullshit.
We all know who did this.

Why don't we let them clean it up?

Hey, Kevin, you and Malone
got some little rivalry

going over your girlfriend,
that's your guys' problem.

He does not work for me.
You do. Grab a mop.

Martinez, venga aqui.

Oh, God, that was fun!

Boys, somebody want to
tell me what's so amusing?

Nothing. Just happy
to be here. That's all.

Oh. I just told them
a joke, that's all.

Well, let's hear it, Palmer.

Uh...uh...okay.

Well, let me see
if I can remember it.

Oh. So this horse
walks into a bar.

And then the bartender's like,

"Hey, dude, why are you so sad?"

And the horse is like,
"It's all good."

And the bartender's like,
"Hey, get out of my bar."

Guess you had to be there.

Have Nurse Hatcher check Palmer
for possible concussion.

All right, $2.00.

All right. There's $2.00.

Thank you.

I'm gonna be in town
for a few days,

and what do you say
we hang out?

How old are you?

I'm gonna be 18
in about four years,

but, you know,
we can still hang out.

Look, I'm really flattered,

but your mother is--

Definitely do not have to bring
the mother into this.

No. Honey, your mother
is calling you.

Oh.
Ryan, let's go.

They're waiting for you.
Thanks.

That was awesome. I can't
believe you did--How'd you--

So, who's first?

Me!

We're not home now,
so please leave us a message.

How long you been
standing there?

A little while.

You look busy. I didn't want to disturb you.

Well, you did, so...

I just wanted to tell you
that I organized the walk-in.

Okay.

Is there something else
I can do for you?

No.

You know, you're freaking me out a little bit.

Sorry. I'll leave you alone.

Uh, where do you live?

Nearby.

You married?

Yeah. I just was interested
in what you do when you're not here.

Is it just me, or are you extra curious today?

You're right.
It's none of my business.

Uh, where are you from
originally?

Vermont.

Hi.

I'm impressed.

You're not so bad yourself.

Yeah. I had my eyes closed.

And I was skating switch.

No, you weren't.

Shut up.

So, dishdogz
teaching you the ropes?

Yeah, pretty much.

What about Tony?

What about Malone?

Sorry. I just hope I'm not messing anything up
between you and him.

You're not. There's nothing
between me and him.

Are you sure?

Okay, okay. I just hate being the bad guy.

Well, you're not the bad guy.

And I hate to say it,
I have to go.

I have a lot of stuff
I have to take care of.

Yeah. I've got a lot of stuff
I gotta take care of, too.

No, you don't.

No, I don't.

Thanks.

What's that for?

Skating's always better
with somebody else.

Yeah, it is.

Mind if I join you?

You scared me
to death, man.

What are you doing out here?
You following me?

No. Hey, for someone who doesn't skate,
you do pretty well.

I have my moments.

Who's Freddy Knox?

I never heard of him.

Really?

That's what I said.

Look, you want to skate
or ask me a bunch of questions?

Try to keep up.

Dude, did you see that?

Yeah. Yeah. What should I do?
Alert the media?

Oh, come on.
That was, like, 6 feet!

You know what?
Some of the best skaters I know

couldn't land that trick
if their life depended on it.

But they could take something, you know,
as simple as a Smith grind

and make it look
like a thing of beauty.

Dude, you couldn't
even land that.

I'm telling you, it's never about the tricks.

It's about individual expression.

You know, how do you skate
when nobody's looking?

That defines your style,
and that is what makes a great skateboarder:

style, nothing else.

Style.

What is this, movie night?

Shut up. I'm trying to teach you
something here.

I mean, look at this.

See, these guys
are the real pioneers.

They started out on the water.

It's like a quarter pipe
in constant motion.

I mean, it's not real
flashy or anything.

Everybody's cool, but they've got
their own individual expression.

I mean, I'm not gonna do much surfing
out here in the desert.

No, but it's all--look, it's fluid, liquid.

Apply that same logic
to the wheels

and just let it roll.

Hey.

You look tired.

Yeah, I'm toast.

Where you been?
I haven't seen you for a while.

Been real busy.

We should hook up soon.

Okay.

I'm gonna watch a movie later.

Do you want to come?

Oh, actually, I'd love to,

but I gotta hit the sack
early tonight.

Okay.

Suit yourself.

Okay.

See you.

This reminds me of a night a long time ago,

me and my buddies busted
into the Del Mar Skate Ranch.

Couldn't even see
what we were skating.

Go for it. Just trust your instincts.

I could trust my instincts
better if I could see.

The bowl hasn't
changed any, all right?

Stop whining and jump in there.

Come on.

You're nuts.

I'm nuts?

You're the one that's
skating in the dark.

Well, it ain't much,
but I call it home.

You want a beer?

Yeah. I'll have a beer.

Yeah. Dream on.

What?

Nothing, man.
I just, uh...

I wanted to thank you, you know, for, like--

Oh!
skating with me.

Hey, man, listen,
no need to thank me.

I kind of forgot what it was like,
just skating with friends.

Friends, huh?

Friends like, uh,
Freddy Knox?

Freddy Knox.

You want to know
about Freddy Knox?

Yeah.

Not much to tell.

Just a simple kid
from the Midwest.

Paper route, the whole deal.

Kind of a loner.

The rest of the kids were learning
to play Little League, play piano.

I just skated day and night,
and it was great.

Out in California, skateboarding was exploding.

I mean, kids my age,
they were cashing in.

I just... I don't know.

What?

Figured I had my home town
conquered, you know.

I'd take off.

You want to be a farmer,
you go to lowa.

Me, I wanted to be
a skateboarder.

So I went to California
and never went home.

I took my chances.

I mean, you gotta remember,
skateboarding back then

was just a West Coast sport.

I didn't figure
I'd have much chance

against all the guys
I'd heard about.

Yeah, some of those first contests,
they were pretty rough.

Slowly, l, I don't know,

got a little more confidence,

got better,

and then something happened.

I just started winning.

People just started
throwing money at me.

I mean, I bought a house.
I bought that car.

Dude, I had my own line
of skateboards

before I was even
old enough to vote.

I thought it would never end.

Then the money
began to disappear.

I don't know.

I made some bad choices.

Did my time, though.

Figured I'd leave
Freddy Knox behind.

You know, change my name,
start a new life.

Dude, you were a legend.

I mean, it was guys like you

that made skateboarding
what it is today.

I perpetuated everything
that's wrong with this sport today.

I sacrificed the sport that I love

for a taste of money and fame.

I learned to cook.

No complaints.

So how does the story end?

Look.

If I could just get one kid to skate

because he loves it,
you know?

It's what's in his heart,
like me when I was a kid,

that's a legacy I could live with.

Here's to your legacy.

This is the spot.

I don't think we're
supposed to be here.

We could get arrested.

Shot, more likely.

Maybe we should go.

Maybe not. You know what? That's the
problem with your whole generation.

You guys got no sense
of adventure.

Come here. Look at this.

Well, what do you think?

Whoa!

Yeah? Well, one more step
and I'll blow your brains out.

Easy, kemosabe.
How you doing?

You guys are
running a little late.

Yeah. I always forget
where this place is at.

Who's the rookie?

It's Kevin.
Kevin, this is my old friend Tony Alva.

Well, you got
the power pool, man.

Skate at your own
risk, all right?

You heard the man.

You got it.

Hey, man, not bad for a rookie.

He's got a little something.

Yeah. I think you
need to hang out

with the old school crew, man,

because, you know,
style is everything.

What did I tell you?

Still got it. Look out.

Yo! Hey, where you been?

Ah! You really
want to know?

I've been skating in an abandoned pool with
Tony Alva.

That's funny.

Now get serious and tell us

where you been
hiding lately, man.

Cassidy's bunk, perhaps?

Good start. Now go on.

Man, you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

I knew it.
Dit-dit-dit-dit.

Okay, okay!

Okay, so we'll see you
in a few days.

Now, you have my cell number
and my pager number.

And, oh! My mother's phone number
is in my office,

just in case of emergencies.

Yeah.
We all set?

I got it.

Attention, staff and counselors.

The buses have
left the premises.

Please...

disregard all rules of conduct

and concern
for your own safety!

Have fun!

Beautiful day, huh, Palmer?

All right, boys. You'll know our prey
by this rare marking.

He's out there somewhere.

Let's go get him.

Sit down, sit down.

How are you doing?

Dude!
Hey!

What's up, dawg?
You gettin' a tan?

Yeah. Trying.

Yeah, man.

Where you been?

Oh, man, I've been busy.

In fact, what are you
doing tonight?

Something with you.

Shut up.

Well, well, well,
if it isn't the lovebirds.

Yes. If it isn't the lovebirds.

Lovebirds!

Okay.

Just came by
to wish you luck today.

You're gonna be
at the road burn, right?

Yeah.

I'll be looking for you.

Yeah. Don't forget your helmet.

Yeah. You want a bun
for your wiener?

Oh, man.

Jesus.

Hey, what's a road burn?

You'll see.

Hey, you have any thoughts?

Yeah: don't die.

Okay, guys, the rules are simple.

First one down wins.

That's it. Play fair,
and I'll see you at the bottom.

Hey, what's that
on your face?

What? What is it?

It looks like a buttstache.

3...
What's a buttstache?

2... 1!

Go!

Back! Get back.

Hey!

I broke that arm once...
three fingers,

front tooth, jaw,

and a dislocated shoulder...
twice.

Arm twice, right foot once,

jaw once, left foot twice,

collarbone once,
dislocated hip,

hyperextended knee...twice.

Whoa! You broke your penis?

What's the prognosis here?

Well, I wouldn't do any cartwheels
for a couple of weeks.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Good. Let's roll. Come on.

Thank you.

Whoa.

I, uh... hi. I'm--

Hi, Tony. I'm Tara.

It's nice to meet you.

Okay.

Yeah. Um...

Time to make the doughnuts.

Relax, man. He'll get
what's comin' to him.

Hey, where are you guys going?

Gonna go break
Malone's face.

No. You know what?
I don't think you want to be doing that.

You telling me I shouldn't
stand up for myself?

No. I'm telling you
that eventually Malone is gonna get his.

Just hang back.

I mean, how am l
supposed to work now?

I don't know.
What, we got two weeks of camp left?

We'll figure something out.

I can't skate.
What am I even doing here?

Kevin, you're better than Malone
is any day of the week.

You don't gotta
prove that to anybody.

So I should just
sit back and do nothing?

Take a swim.

Cool off, man,
come on. Come on.

Take a swim?

Welcome back!

Can't keep a good
dog down, huh?

That's right.

Good thing you're right-handed.

So give us the details.
Did you close the deal?

Close the deal?

Give the kid a break.
He doesn't kiss and tell.

Not to mention Cassidy
is a respectable girl...

with amazing breasts.

Oh, my gosh.
What?

I totally spaced on our date.

You forgot your date.

Dawg, you're screwed!

What do I do?

You're gonna have to
make it up to her.

Get down.

Make it up to her?

Kevin.

So cute!

Thank you.

You look amazing.

Thank you.

I'm impressed.

I have to warn you.

If I start nodding off,

it's not because of you.

It's because of the painkillers.
Okay.

Your waiter will be
right with you.

Thank you.

Heh!

Good evening.
Welcome to Chez Tony.

I am Tony.

I have prepared for you this evening my
specialty:

a pasta primavera
in a white wine sauce.

I'm sure you'll like it
very much.

Would you like a salad
or anything to start?

Sounds great. Thank you.

Madame.

Thanks.

Sir.

Enjoy.

Not to be outdone, I took the liberty

of providing for your listening pleasure
the house entertainment.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the Juan Martinez Experience.

Tonight was really special.

Thank you.

Yeah.

Believe it or not,
it was my first date.

I know.

No. It was mine, too.

Really?

Yeah.

That's cute!

Well, I guess
I will talk to you...

tomorrow.

Okay.

Bye. See you later.

Bye.

What is this?

"Dishdogz."

Keep what legacy alive?

Hey.

Hey, what's up?

Tough luck out there.

I guess you were just
out of your league.

I'll tell you what,
why don't we just bury the hatchet?

I could sign your cast. Maybe it'll be
worth something someday.

Settle down, people.
Please, can I have your attention?

Just a few announcements.

Well, it's been another great year
here at Point X.

No lawsuits, no deaths--

well, except for Nurse Kaplan,

which was through
no fault of her own.

And I hope to see all of you here again next
year.

Now, before I let you go out
and enjoy your final day with us,

I'd like to thank
the staff and counselors

for once again making this
the greatest camp in the world.

Also, I'd like to recognize a group of people

who do a very difficult job
and go largely unrecognized.

Tony, the kitchen crew,

come out here, you guys.

Guys, we had a pretty
good summer, you know?

I hope you guys liked the food.

So that's what they call it.

We enjoyed serving you.

Most of you, anyway.

Not you so much.
You think you're cool.

You think you know
a couple of hot tricks.

That makes you the world's
greatest skater, huh?

You got no style.

Dude, he's calling you out.

What do you know
about style, old man?

Hey, you better
show him some respect.

Or what?

To the bowl. To the bowl.

It sounds like you guys are going to the bowl.

Him? You want me
to go up against Kevin?

Well, that would be too easy.

Settle down, people.
We don't have liability for this kind of stuff.

No, no, no, Miles.

I think everybody would like to see this,
am I right?

Yeah!

To the bowl! To the bowl!

To the bowl! To the bowl!

Just tell me when.

How about now?

All right. Let's go.

To the bowl! To the bowl!

Hey, hey, what's going on?

I think Kevin and Malone are gonna
have a gunfight at the bowl or something.

What?

Man, I don't know.
I'm not so sure about this.

You're better than he is.

You'll kick his ass or I will.

And I'll jump in.

Kevin, you're gonna
shred his ass, okay?

Just don't show any fear, okay?

I've seen you skate, man,
and you're better than him.

Dude!
You speak English?

Yeah. When did that happen?

I was born in ldaho.

ldaho's not in Mexico.
What?

I was born--

But why?

Because you never asked me.

What?

Listen, dawg. Take in
the back door boys.

We gonna stand here all day,
or are we gonna skate?

Call it in the air.

Heads.

You first.

Get him.
Go, Kevin, go.

You the man!
Whoa!

Oh, no way!
Go!

Hey, Mom.

Yeah, I'm fine.

No. I just wanted to let you know
that I'm gonna be home soon.

Yeah. Yeah, it was good.

Okay. Well, I love you.

See you soon.

Bye.

Thanks.

I hate this part.

I do.

How about... I'll see you
in a couple weeks.

Okay.

Bye.

Hey.

So I didn't think we could do it,

but we beat him.

Ha! You beat him.

But don't let it go to your head,

or I'll come back and kick your butt
personally, you got it?

Yeah.

I do want you to remember
the things we talked about, though.

You know, about being
your own man,

having a little style.

I'm my own man.

Right.

All right, Tony. See ya.

Kevin.

Well, it's been good
having you here,

and I wanted to offer
you a position

as camp counselor next year.

That is, if you're interested.

Oh! Camp counselor.
I'm flattered.

I don't know what to tell you.

Well, I guess this is it.

See you next year?

I hope so.

Well, you better,
'cause we sure as hell

don't want to train
some other fool.

All right, we're even now.

You coming with us?

No, man. I'm cool.

All right. Well, you take care.

Let me get my keys.

Here.

See you next year.

Yeah. See you guys.

Why are they dressed
in paper diapers?

I don't want to know.

So what do you say?

You know what?

If I'm gonna come back,
and it's gonna be all the same,

I think I'd rather be a dishdog.

Okay. For what it's worth,

I'm glad you smoked
Malone's ass.

I never liked that little prick.

Oh, man.

I gotta get out of here.

You ready?

Yeah.
