{y:i}and a holy man...{y}

{y:i}searching for New Mecca.{y}

She's in the shower.

{y:i}I told one man...{y}

where I might go.

I showed trust to one man.

Did I make a mistake, Imam?

There is no simple answer.

Whatever was said
was meant to give us a chance...

a fighting chance.

Were it not for the threat of invasion,
I never would have betrayed you.

{y:i}I give you my word, Riddick.{y}
Riddick!

Riddick!

{y:i}[Riddick]{y}
{y:i}And a daughter...{y}

No!
Whose name would be...

If you have issue with me,
you let it be with me.

You need not know their names.
{y:i}[Girl]{y}
{y:i}Ziza.{y}

My name is Ziza.

Ziza.

Cute kid.
{y:i}- Did you really kill monsters?{y}

The ones that were gonna
hurt my father?

Such are our bedtime stories.

Go, Ziza. Go on!

So now who do I have to kill
to get this payday off my head?

{y:i}[People Chanting, Indistinct]{y}

{y:i}It is said the comet{y}
{y:i}always precedes them...{y}

these world-enders.

The Coalsack planets are gone.

{y:i}Eight million settlers missing.{y}

{y:i}The entire Aquilan System is gone too.{y}

Helion Prime shares its sunlight
with all worlds nearby.

If we fall, they fall.

And after that...

My God,
how do I save my family?

{y:i}Have you heard anything I've said?{y}

You said
it's all circling the drain...
the whole universe.

{y:i}Right?{y}
That's right.

Had to end sometime.



The one you want is now here.

And whose throat is this?

If you cut my throat, I'll not be able to
rescind the offer that brought you here.

Nor tell you why it's so vital
that you did come.

The blade comes off
when the bounty comes off.

This is Aereon,
an envoy from the Elemental race.

She means you no harm.

There are very few of us
who have met a Necromonger
and lived to speak of it.

{y:i}So when I choose to speak of it,{y}
{y:i}you should choose to listen.{y}

Necromonger.

It is the name that will convert
or kill every last human life...

{y:i}unless the universe{y}
{y:i}can rebalance itself.{y}

Maybe you should pretend like you're talkin'
to someone educated in the penal system.

{y:i}In fact, don't pretend.{y}

{y:i}Balance is everything{y}
{y:i}to elementals.{y}

Water to fire.
Earth to air.

{y:i}We have 33 different words for it.{y}

But now we have only time
to speak of the balance of opposites.

{y:i}There is a story, Riddick,{y}
{y:i}of young male Furyans...{y}

strangled at birth...

strangled with their own cords.

When Aereon told this story
to the Helion leaders,

I told her of you.

What do you know of your early years?
Do you remember your home world?

Where it was?
Have you met any others?

Others like yourself.

Sister, they don't know
what to do with just one of me.

She, uh...

She went looking for you.

She went to prison.

L... I don't remember where.

But it was a world so hot
you not su{y:i}rv{y}ive on the surface.

Crematoria.
Young Jack.

She thought of you
as her older brother.

She worshipped you.
You were supposed to watch her.

{y:i}She never forgave you...{y}

for leaving just when
she needed you most.

She needed to
stay away from me.
You all do.

Are you gonna stop

When it's over.


{y:i}I borrowed a ship.{y}

You can ride along,
if you don't mind riding with a convict.

I thank you, but I must get
my family across the river.

God willing, there is still
a shelter I can get them...

I'm sure God has his tricks,

{y:i}but getting out of places{y}
{y:i}no one else can,{y}

Let's go replenish the ranks.

Never fails to inspire, does it?

Each time a dynasty falls.

Remember your place,
Dame Vaako.

My place is at your side,
dear husband.

From here till UnderVerse come.

In this 'verse,

life is antagonistic
to the natural state.

{y:i}Here, humans in all{y}
{y:i}their various races...{y}

are a spontaneous outbreak...

an unguided mistake.

Our purpose...

is to correct that mistake.

Because there is another 'verse...

a 'verse where life
is welcomed and cherished.

{y:i}A ravishing, ever-new place{y}
{y:i}called UnderVerse.{y}

But the road to that 'verse...

crosses over the threshold.

Threshold!
Take us to the threshold!

What you call... death.

{y:i}[Muttering]{y}
{y:i}So it is this 'verse{y}
{y:i}that must be cleansed oflife,{y}

so that UnderVerse
can populate and prosper.

[People Clamoring]

{y:i}Look around you.{y}
{y:i}Every Necromonger in this hall,{y}

every one of the Legion Vast that just
swept aside your defenses in one night...

was once like you.

Fought as feebly as you.

Every Necromonger
that lives today...

is a convert.

There'll be no conversions!
We all began as something else!

It was hard for me to accept, too,
when I first heard these words.

But I changed.

I let them take away my pain.

You betrayed your faith!
Just as you will change...

{y:i}when you realize that the threshold{y}
{y:i}to the UnderVerse will be crossed...{y}

{y:i}only by those who have{y}
{y:i}embraced the Necromonger faith.{y}

For those of you
who will right now...

drop to your knees
and ask to be purified.

We will not renounce our faith!
No one here
will do what you ask.

It is unthinkable!

{y:i}This is a world of many peoples,{y}
{y:i}many religions.!{y}

And we simply cannot
and will not be converted!

Then I'll take your soul.

{y:i}- Join him...{y}
{y:i}- [Body Thuds]{y}

Or join me.

This is your one chance.

Take the Lord Marshal's offer
and bow.

I bow to no man.

He's not a man.

He's the holy Half-Dead
who has seen the UnderVerse.

Look, I'm not
with everyone here.

But I will take a piece of him.

A piece you will have.

[Growls]
{y:i}- [People Gasping]{y}

[People Gasping]

{y:i}Stop him.!{y}

Irgun. One of my best.

If you say so.

What do you think of this blade?

I think it's a half-gram heavy
on the back end.

In our faith,

you keep what you kill.


Are you familiar to me?

Have we met
on some distant field?

You'd think I'd remember.

You'd think I would too.

Take him before the Quasi-Deads.

Perhaps the breeder
would do it...

if somebody just asked him.

It is a rare offer.

A visit inside Necropolis.

It's been a long time
since I smelled beautiful.

Let me show you the way.

Beautiful eyes.

Come.

The last six Lord Marshals
have called this home.

Magnificent, isn't it?

I might have gone
a different way.
True of us all.

{y:i}Converts receiving the mark{y}
{y:i}of the Necromonger.{y}

They learn how one pain
can lessen another.

There now.

That is just... perfect.

The more you resist them,

the greater the damage will be.

That is what you had in mind,
right, Toombs?

Hey, how does he know
where we're goin', and we don't?
Dope it out.

I hate this run.
Just do it!

Don't know about this
new crew of yours.

They seem a bit skittish.

Probably shouldn't tell 'em
what happened to the last crew.

You know, you supposed
to be some slick-shit killer.

Now look at you...

all back-of-the-bus
and shit.

{y:i}I say we attack Helion Two next.{y}

Take it straight
into their teeth.

It'll cost you 20,000 heads,
five warrior ships.
Nothing more, I swear it.

While I do prize brute force,

this approach
is perhaps more artful.

Start at the end.

Go straight to Helion Five,

the last planet
in the system.

We approach from the night side.

{y:i}Remove these cannon first,{y}

then attack
the larger placements at speed.

{y:i}We'll catch them on their rear flank.{y}
{y:i}And in ten days'time,{y}

{y:i}the rest of those worlds{y}
{y:i}will tumble before us.{y}

You see, as with most,
their blind spot...

is right behind them.

I've located an ion trail
which leads off-world.

Then you should be
off-world, Vaako.

I've deployed a tracker team.
One of the best.

Wherever Riddick has gone,
you lens him out and cleanse him.

You.
You want me to take a frigate
for one breeder?

Don't question it, Vaako!

Take it on faith.

He's always been unsettled around you...

the Lord Marshal.

Unsteady.

Perhaps because he knows
he's half the warrior you are.

{y:i}Some say he's too artistic{y}
{y:i}for thejob.{y}

I wouldn't be surprised
if someone promoted him soon...

{y:i}to full dead.{y}

Take care what you say.

Should I say it softly?

So it sounds more
like conspiracy?

Oh, why is it that when anyone
breathes about the demise of him
on the throne...

everyone assumes
a conspiracy?

Why isn't that
just prudent planning?

When he is ready,
he will name a successor.

Who?

Toal? Scales? The Purifier?

None of them...

with the strength,
the dignity,

of Lord Vaako.

You can keep what you kill.

Stop.
That is the Necromonger way.

I said... stop.

His death will come in due time
and not a moment sooner.

Why?
Because I se{y:i}rv{y}e him. We all se{y:i}rv{y}e him.
It's called fidelity.

It's called stupidity.

{y:i}Why else would they{y}
{y:i}come and go like the wind?{y}

But where has he gone?
Where is the Furyan hiding now?

You be the good warrior.

Go after this Riddick.

I'll find out why the Lord Marshal
is so threatened by him.

{y:i}[Creaking]{y}

{y:i}[Panting]{y}
Do you know
you grind your teeth at night?

Sexy.


{y:i}[Female Computer Voice]{y}
{y:i}Destination reached.{y}

{y:i}Unlocking manual controls.{y}

All right. I make 700 degrees
on the day side,

300 below on the night side.

Let's not get caught in the sun.

If I owned this place and hell,

I'd rent this place out
and live in hell.

{y:i}- [Female Computer Voice]{y}
{y:i}Blue angle... good.{y}
Stand by.

{y:i}And...{y}

{y:i}[Female Computer Voice]{y}
{y:i}Plotted course good.{y}

Hit it!

{y:i}[Female Computer Voice]{y}
{y:i}Angle of approach, not good.{y}

[Laughing]
{y:i}- Look, Ma. No hands.!{y}

{y:i}[Shouting, Laughing]{y}

Party poppers!

I think I shit myself.

Skittish, Toombs. Very skittish.

Comry?

When the ride's over,

your goggles are mine.


Four-way split!

29.4 kilometers.

So, this is Riddick.

What in the bowels of Christ
are you talkin' about, 700K?

Don't take this one, boss.

See? Anatoli here
has a nose for trouble.

And this one, this Riddick guy...

Big, big trouble.

So, 700,000 is good money.

I'd take the money, Toombs.

{y:i}[Clanging]{y}
The guild pays us a caretaker's fee
for each prisoner each year.

We pay mercs 20% of that total fee
based on a certain life expectancy.

{y:i}How's about this?{y}

You open that safe you got hidden
behind the console there,

{y:i}show me the real books,{y}
{y:i}then we{y} f{y:i}igure out my cut.{y}

{y:i}Then I'll be on my way.{y}

{y:i}Open my books.{y}
{y:i}This is what you suggest?{y}

Wasn't a suggestion.

{y:i}[Clanging Continues]{y}

{y:i}[Clanging Continues]{y}

{y:i}These are dangerous days,{y}
{y:i}if you believe the talk.{y}

Talk?
About dead planets.

About some ghost army.

About them.

"Them"?

I'll run the numbers again.

It takes a couple of days,
probably,

so you can stay as my guest.

At least here, we are all safe.

Yes?
{y:i}[Man]{y}
Y{y:i}es, boss.{y}

I'll give it a day.

One.

{y:i}[Man]{y}
{y:i}There are inmates...{y}

{y:i}and there are convicts.{y}

A convict has a certain code.

And he knows to show
a certain respect.

{y:i}An inmate, on the other hand,{y}

pulls the pin on his fellow man.

{y:i}Does the guards'work for them.{y}

Brings shame...
[Shouts]

To the game.

So, which are you gonna be?

Me?

I'm just passin' through.

Welcome to Crematoria.

Should I go for the sweet spot?

Left of the spine, fourth lumbar down,
the abdominal aorta.

What a gusher.

How do I get eyes like that?

You gotta kill a few people.

Did that.

Did a lot of that.

And then you gotta get sent to a slam.
One where they tell you you'll
never see daylight again?

Only there wasn't any doctor here
who could shine my eyes,
not even for 20 menthol Kools.

Was there anything
you said that was true?

What are you gonna do, huh?
Go for the sweet spot?

Remember who
you're talkin' to, Jack.

Jack's dead.
She was weak.

She couldn't cut it.

The name's Kyra now.

And I'm a new animal.

They can be quite a test,
these deep runs...

tests of our inner selves.

Don't you find that true?

Some men do.

{y:i}Just being so far from the armada,{y}

the mind can start to fill
with strange thoughts, doubts.

Don't you ever have doubts, Vaako?

Doubts?
About the campaign.

About Lord Marshal.

First and always,
I am a Necromonger commander.

So if you're here to test my loyalty,
you succeed only in testing my patience.

Oh, no.
No, that's not why I'm here at all.

{y:i}[Dame Vaako]{y}
{y:i}I'm so glad I could{y}
{y:i}steal you away for a moment.{y}

Doesn't it strike you odd?

{y:i}Here we have{y}
{y:i}the current Lord Marshal...{y}

{y:i}destroying entire societies,{y}
{y:i}and yet he can't bring himself...{y}

to kill one
stranded Elemental.

Why is that?

You don't pray to our god.

You pray to no god, I hear.

Elementals... we calculate.

Don't we all.

But now let's have first things first.

What of Riddick?
In truth, I don't know
where he went.

In truth, I'm more interested
in where he came from.

Watch your step.

I've always wondered,

does an air Elemental fly?

{y:i}Now do me a favor.{y}

Calculate the odds of you
getting off this planet alive...

and now cut them in half.

No, we can't fly.

But we glide very well.

{y:i}Save your threats, Necromonger.{y}

I would have told you about Riddick
for the asking.

It concerns a foretelling,
a prediction now more than 30 years old.

{y:i}Ayoung warrior{y}
{y:i}once consulted a seer.{y}

{y:i}He was told a child would be born{y}
{y:i}on the planet Furya... a male child...{y}

{y:i}who would someday{y}
{y:i}cause the warrior's downfall.{y}

{y:i}[Female Voice]{y}
{y:i}Cause his untimed death.{y}

Furya? Furya's a ruined world.
No life to speak of.

For good reason.

This young warrior
mounted an attack on Furya,

killing all young males
he could find,

even strangling some
with their birth cords.

An artful stroke,
wouldn't you say?

So this warrior, the one
who tried to outwit the prediction,
would later become...

That's why he worries.

The Lord Marshal.

Which would make
the man-child...

He worries he missed
killing that child in its crib.

Riddick.

{y:i}[Baby Crying]{y}

{y:i}That's why it's so vital to him.{y}
Wait.

{y:i}- It's about a prophecy.{y}
Wait! Wait!

Are you there?

You do what your lord asks.

You cleanse Riddick for him,
and in doing so...

you prove your undying loyalty.

And perhaps then
he'll finally let down his guard.

{y:i}[Man]{y}
{y:i}Still here, I see?{y}

I've been here 18 years.
See this?

I remember how gorgeous she was.
Well, gorgeous in a certain light.

And now,
for the goddamn death of me,

I cannot remember her name.

Feeding time!

{y:i}[Loud Snarling]{y}

We're here for the rest
of our unnatural lives.

{y:i}[Snarling Continues]{y}

Here they come!

[Snarling Continues]

Whatever you do,
don't make eye contact.



[Men Shouting]

Aaah!

[Gasping]
[Growls]

{y:i}[Beasts Chomping]{y}



{y:i}[Alarm Buzzing]{y}

It's an animal thing.

{y:i}[Footsteps]{y}

{y:i}Check her for me.{y}
{y:i}She's always got a blade somewhere.{y}

Hyah!
[Groans]


[Grunting]
[Yells]



{y:i}I don't think{y}
{y:i}she likes being touched.{y}

I'd take my wounded and go
while you still can.


Is there a name for this
private little world of yours, huh?

What happens there
when we don't just run away?

Y{y:i}ou'll kill us... with a soup cup?{y}

Tea, actually.

What's that?

I'll kill you with my teacup.

You know the rule. They aren't dead
if they're still on the books.

Mmm.



Come on.

Death by teacup.

Damn. Why didn't I think of that?

{y:i}I didn't come to play{y}
{y:i}"Who's the Better Killer? '"{y}

But it's my favorite game.
Haven't you heard?

I heard you came lookin' for me.
{y:i}Is that all?{y}

Then you missed the good part.

Hooked up with some mercs
outta Lupus Five.

{y:i}Said they'd take me on,{y}
{y:i}teach me the trade, give me a good cut.{y}

They slaved me out, Riddick.

{y:i}Do you know what that could do to you{y}
{y:i}when you're that age?{y}

When you're 12 years old?
I told you to stay in New Mecca.

Did you not listen?

I had mercs on my neck.

I'll always have mercs on my neck.

I spent five years on a frozen heap
just to keep 'em away from you.

And you go and sign up
with the same fake badges...

that wanted to cut you up
and use you for bait.

What are you pitching, Riddick?
That you cuttin' out was a good thing?

That you had my ass covered
from halfway across the universe?

You signed with mercs.

There was nobody else around.

{y:i}[Door Slams]{y}

Let's pop the cork.
Get some fresh air.



So they do go topside...

to swap out air.

Interesting.

Who the hell are you?

When it happens, it'll happen fast.

{y:i}Stay on my leg when I cut fence{y}
{y:i}or stay here...{y}

for the rest of your natural life.

Nobody outs this place.
Nobody.

{y:i}[Kyra]{y}
{y:i}He ain't "nobody. '"{y}

{y:i}Good news first.{y}
{y:i}Talked things over with my amigos here.{y}

We'll cut you in for 775K.

Well, all right.

What's the bad news?
They close the local whorehouse?


{y:i}No. The bad news is worse than that.{y}
{y:i}Much worse.{y}

Our pilot, he saw this.
It crossed a shipping lane.

{y:i}Any idea what this might be?{y}

Never saw nothin' like it.

{y:i}This ship charts back{y}
{y:i}to Helion Prime.{y}

You know, Anatoli's
got a nose for trouble,

{y:i}and he thinks{y}
{y:i}trouble follows you here.{y}

{y:i}Look. We dusted our tracks{y}
{y:i}and got the hell outta there.{y}

There is no way
we didn't lose them.

"Them"?

This is my prisoner{y:i}. Mine.{y}

Nobody else's.

And I want my money now.

{y:i}So...{y}

you stole a prisoner...

from "them"?


{y:i}[Gunfire]{y}

{y:i}[Gunfire Continues]{y}

{y:i}[Gunfire Stops]{y}

No.

{y:i}Riddick. No.!{y}

Shoulda taken the money, Toombs.


[Electricity Crackling]

{y:i}- [Throws Switch]{y}
{y:i}- [Gate Buzzer Sounds]{y}


You gonna kill me?

[Raspy Breathing]


{y:i}[Man Groans]{y}
Mercs.

Some guards here,
but this can't be all of them.

{y:i}Check their slots in the back...{y}
{y:i}and be careful.{y}

{y:i}[Riddick]{y}
{y:i}Don't bother.{y}

Guards ain't there.

{y:i}They{y} f{y:i}igured out the Necros{y}
{y:i}are comin'for me.{y}

Plan was to clean the bank,
ghost the mercs,

break wide through the tunnel.

And then somebody got a lucky shot off
with this rocket launcher here...

and took out the sled.

Guards took off on foot
but rigged the door
so no one could follow.

{y:i}They'll take the one ship in the hangar{y}
{y:i}and leave everyone else here to die.{y}

How come you know all this shit?

You weren't even here.

'Cause it was my plan.

I shoulda taken the money.

We'll last five minutes.

Five minutes. We ain't gonna last
30 seconds out there.

It'll light you up like a match.

and 30 klicks to the hangar.

{y:i}[Murmuring]{y}

30 klicks over that terrain?

{y:i}[Murmuring Continues]{y}

We could make it.

Stay behind the night,

Riddick?

Go, go! Go on! Go! Climb here!

Climb! Go! Go, go, go!

Boss!

{y:i}Up there.{y}

Take a look.
Because Anatoli says so?

Because his nose says so.


There's nothin' up here.

Oh, shit.

Riddick.

{y:i}They're heading{y}
{y:i}right for the volcano fields.{y}
{y:i}They're going for our ship.!{y}

No chance do they
get to the hangar first.
No chance!

"One speed."

It's too late.
We're never gonna make it.

{y:i}[Woman's Voice, Distorted]{y}

I think you know
who tore Furya apart.

of an entire race.


But it's going to hurt.

{y:i}[Engines Thrumming]{y}

{y:i}[Alarm Siren]{y}


{y:i}[Soft Clatter]{y}

Kyra?

{y:i}I was supposed to{y}
{y:i}deliver a message to you...{y}

if Vaako failed to kill you.

A message from
the Lord Marshal himself.

He tells you to stay away from Helion,
stay away from him,

and in return,
you'll be hunted no more.

But Vaako will most likely
report you as dead.

So this is your chance.

Your chance to do
what no man has ever done.

The girl.

Where will they take her?


We all began... as something else.

I've done... unbelievable things...

in the name of a faith
that was never my own.

And he'll do to her
what he did to me.

The Necromonger in me
warns you not to go back.

But the Furyan in me...

hopes you won't listen.

God knows... I've dreamed of it.

{y:i}I have lost a Purifier...{y}

{y:i}but I have gained{y}
{y:i}a first among commanders.{y}

It is overdue, isn't it...

that we acknowledge
your many accomplishments,

{y:i}your steady faith,{y}

and above all,
your unflinching loyalty.

Obedience without question.
Loyalty till UnderVerse come.

Well done, Vaako.

This is a day of days.

Look more pleased, Vaako.

You have killed his enemy...

and his suspicions.

I should have brought back his head.
You saw him unbreathing.
You saw him dead on the ground.

Riddick was no common breeder.
In a heartbeat he dropped 20 of my men.

All mysteries are not miracles,
not even in this religion.

And if you say it is certain,
then it is certain,

and we've already said it,
haven't we?

We have.

{y:i}[Door Opens]{y}

{y:i}Now, tell me if it's true.{y}

Tell me the Furyan is gone,
and I can close this campaign
without hearing his bootsteps.

If he is dead,

I sense I'm not far
from the same fate,

being of no further use here.

Shouldn't I tell you
that Riddick is still alive?

Don't try me, Aereon.

I could plow you under
with the rest of Helion Prime.

No one really knows the future.

Then tell me the odds
that Vaako met with success,

that I will now be the one...

who can carry his people across
the threshold into UnderVerse,

where they shall begin true life.

Tell me what I want to hear, Aereon,

and maybe
I'll save your home world... for last.

The odds are good...
That?

That you will reach the UnderVerse...

{y:i}soon.{y}

Ascension protocol!

We still have numbers
out there, Lord Marshal...
sweep teams, recon ships.

They would be hard-pressed
to make it back...

Get my armada off the ground!

{y:i}[Engines Thrumming]{y}
{y:i}[Large Machinery Noises]{y}


[Heavy Slam]

[Chattering Continues]
[Heavy Slam]

You mean on Helion?
I mean here, on this very ship!

Could you be wrong?
Mind fabricates fear.

Could you be wrong?
Not so wrong as you
when you left him alive!

It's twice a mistake.

Not only your failure,
but now the report of success.

How do we salvage this? How? How?

Lord Marshal's got to be warned.

You will never see the UnderVerse!

He will kill us both
before our due time.

I say give Riddick his chance.

If he is half of what you think,

he can at least wound the Lord Marshal...

and that is when you must act.

Just to take his place?
Just to keep what I kill?

That is the Necromonger way.
It is not enough!

Then you do it for the faith!

If he has fear, he has weakness.

If he has weakness, Vaako...

He is unworthy of lordship.

We do it for all Necromongers.

Protect the faith.

This can still be a day of days,

but the timing...

must be flawless.

Final protocol.
Execute on my order.

{y:i}[Panicked Chattering]{y}

{y:i}[Engines Thrumming]{y}

Are they leaving now?

{y:i}We found this Lensor dead.{y}

He came for me.

{y:i}[Lord Marshal]{y}
{y:i}Consider this;{y}

{y:i}If you fall here now,{y}

you'll never rise.

{y:i}But if you choose another way...{y}

{y:i}the Necromonger way...{y}

{y:i}you'll die in due time...{y}

and rise again in the UnderVerse.

Go to him.

It hurts...

at first.

But after a while,
the pain goes away,
just as they promise.

Are you with me, Kyra?
There's a moment...

when you can almost
see the UnderVerse through his eyes.

It makes it sound perfect...

a place where anyone
can start over.

Are you with me, Kyra?

Convert now...

or fall forever.

You killed everything I know.

Vaako.


Not yet.

Been a long time
since I've seen my own blood.

These are his last moments.


Give me your soul.

Fuck you!
[Groans]







You're not the one to bring me down.




Now! Kill the beast
while he's wounded!

[Exhales Deeply]


Help me, Vaako. Kill him.

Vaako?

Forgive me.

Flawless.

No.

No-o-o!

Now what would be
the odds of that?

I thought you were dead.

Are you with me, Kyra?

I was always with you.

I was.

You keep what you kill.
