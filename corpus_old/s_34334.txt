Where should I wash them?

Use the bathroom.

What's the difference?

That's for food.

[Turns Off Water]

Leave it on.
Just leave it on! Okay?

I don't think
I can do this.

I don't think I can
do this anymore.

I am so sorry.

Can we talk about this
when I get back?

Yes, Jeffrey.

Jeff!.

You've been served.

Now, what this one is is
a temporary restraining order,

Right.
Now,

but the judge threw it out.

And you ought to know that.

That's right.

How does--
How does one go to jail?

Wh-What does my family do?

Go on welfare?

Put food on the table?
I mean, my children need me.

Dr. Wigand, listen.

As I understand from Dick,
you're our key witness,

And I think I know
how you're feeling.

In combat, events have
a duration of seconds.

Sometimes minutes.

Week in, week out.

Month after month
after month.

You're assaulted
psychologically.

You're assaulted
financially,

directed at your kids.

What school can you afford?

How will that
affect their lives?

You're asking yourself,

"Will that limit
what they may become?"

I do know how it is.

You attract a crowd.

Yeah.
Great.

I heard about
the Kentucky gag order.

I don't know what to do.

[ Crowd Chattering, Laughing ]

Hold on a second.

[Man On Police Radio.:
Indistinct]

I can't seem to find
the criteria to decide.

Maybe things have changed.

A lot's changed.

You mean since this morning?

No, I mean since whenever.

Fuck it.

Let's go to court.

[ Chattering Subsides ]

I want to start
as fast as possible.

Please stand.
Raise your right hand.

Jeffrey S. Wigand.
R-E-Y. W-l-G-A-N-D.

No, I don't have
a clue.

That is correct.
In other words, it acts as a drug,

Your objection's been recorded.

I am instructing you...

not to answer that question.

In accordance to the terms of
the contractual obligations...

under taken by you...

not to disclose
any information...

And in accordance
with the force and effect...

that has been
entered against you...

That means you don't talk.

Mr. Motley, we have rights here.

Oh, you've got rights.

And lefts.
Ups and downs and middles.

This is not North Carolina,
not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.

Wipe that smirk off your face!

Answer the question,
Doctor.

Um, nicotine
is associated with...

impact, satisfaction.


One of the reasons
I'm here is that I felt...

Then back on Jeff...

Hell of a show, Mike.
Explosive material.

of Kools to the world.

[ Laughing ]

I like that.
[Hewitt]
Corporate has some questions.

When's the air date?
Lowell, Sharon's online three.

Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
[Editor]Here we go.

Brown &Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

[ Wallace ] All of us did.
There was this whole line of people,

whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

We are in the nicotine
delivery business.

There is extensive use of this
technology, known as ammonia chemistry.

It allows for the nicotine tobe
more rapidly absorbed in the lung...

and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

[ Wallace ]

You're going to get your fix.


[Dog Barking]

Shall I send for coffee?

because there's
a legal concept...

Tortious interference.

Hence, tortious interference.

And after we corroborate it.

is exact and precise.

And I don't think it would hurt
to make sure you're right on this one.

Why? You think we have liability?

What's the CBS News position,
Eric?

But one we
have to check on, Mike.

I've retained outside counsel
to do exactly that...

What does that mean?
" Rife with--"

And I'm told there are questions
as to our star witness' veracity.

Our standards have to be
higher than anyone else's,

because we are the standard
for everybody else.

Well, with tortious interference,
I'm afraid...

the information he's disclosing.

The truer it is,

If he lied, he didn't
disclose their information,
and the damages are smaller.

Is this Alice in Wonderland?
You said "on this one."

What about this one?

But if it did
and we aired this segment,

and CBS was sued
by Brown &Williamson,

I think we could be
at grave risk.

because of your segment,

the Brown &Williamson
Tobacco Company...

could own CBS.

We're all CBS.
We'll find out soon.

Thank you, gentlemen.

"Tortious interference."

That sounds like a disease
caught by a radio.

-[Hewitt]Lunch?
Sure.

[Dialing Phone]

Debbie, it's me. I want
you to check some filings,

and give me John Wilson's number

No, I'm not.

Since when has the, uh,

It's an alternate version.

So what if we have
an alternate version?

Before you go,

I discovered this.

What?
Yeah, I heard rumors.

It's not a rumor. It's a sale.
If Tisch can unload CBS...

for $81 a share
to Westinghouse,

and then is
suddenly threatened...

with a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit from Brown &Williamson,

Uh, " More vested interests. Persons
who will profit from this merger.

" Mr. Eric Kluster,
president of CBS News,

1 .4 million."

You hear "reasonable"
and "tortious interference."

-[Hewitt] You're exaggerating.
I am?

I do. I deliver him.
He sits. He talks.

maybe the biggest,
most expensive...

Yes.
Is it newsworthy?

Yes.
Are we gonna air it?

Of course not. Why?

Because he's not
telling the truth? No.

And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

If we can't have a whole show, then
I want half a show rather than no show.

What are you? Are you a businessman
or are you a newsman?

Lowell--

What?

I'm with Don
on this.

[Door Opens, Closes]

What's wrong?

What?

I'm alone on this.

[Phone Ringing]

It's Jeffrey Wigand.

Jeffrey.
How are you?

Uh, Liane has filed for divorce.

And, so,
I've moved out.

I checked into room 930.

Odd choice, huh?

I don't know how
to say this,

What?
B&W may have threatened litigation.

CBS is on the block.

But you, I mean-- I know how you--
No.

No, what?

Jeff.

Mrs. Wigand?

All right.

Um, seven months
after we were married,

we found out that I had
multiple sclerosis.

And you had a daughter, Diane--

Quit in protest?

I'm not gonna do that.

You're not?
What are you doing?

You don't like it?
Hey, I tell you what?

Fire my ass.

I don't think so.
Take a look at this.

He wouldn't lie

You backed the wrong horse.

The version without the interview

What was that about?

Get me Wigand.
Sure.

What the fuck is this?
Fuck!

I was not on the team.
I sparred with the Olympic team.

You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
You ever look at another woman's tits?

You ever cheat a little
on your taxes?

with my testimony?

I told the truth!

Hello?

I told the truth.

I told the truth.

I am trying to protect you,

Hello?
It's Lowell.

You bet we are,
and I can't talk to you now.

Thank you.

I'm Sandra Sutherland.
How do you do?

Your Honor,
could I have a word with you?

You presided in a dispute
over support payments.

CBS is under criticism because
the CBS News program, 60 Minutes,

will not be presenting
an interview--

What the hell
are you doing?

What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm editing.

No!
I should have.

Okay? Take a vacation. Now!

[Phone Ringing]

Lowell? Look, I've decided
to preface Sunday's show.

I did three minutes on the
Evening News. You'll want to see it.

in lieu of being fired.

I took off on Tisch.
I took off on Corporate.

I don't know. How does that
get Wigand on the air?

Do me a favor,
will you? Spare me.

That decision
I've already made.

Is there information
that people should have...

Yes.

not to broadcast...

Where's the rest?

Where the hell's the rest?

You cut it!

You corporate lackey.

And in local news,

on former Brown & Williamson

from inside the tobacco industry...

have surfaced
over the past year.

Documents that
appear to confirm...

what a former
U.S. surgeon general...

and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us...

That insider was formerly...

But we cannot broadcast what critical
information about tobacco,

if we were to broadcast
an interview with him,

CBS could be faced with
a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.

The fact is, we are not allowed
even to mention his name...

And, of course, we cannot
show you his face.

Is still in force?
[ Voice Over] Yes, it is.

Get me the manager's office.

I'm concerned for a friend of mine
who's staying at your hotel right now.

Mr. Wigand?

Mr. Wigand?

Did he hear you?

What about now?

What?
Hello? Can you hear me now?


in these words:
Get on the fucking phone.

I-l can't say that.


You manipulated me into this.

That's all.
You're not a robot, Jeff.

Vital inside information
the American public need to know."

So, where you going?

You are... important...

You think about that.

You think about them.

Yeah, guys like you too.

Where are you, anyway?

I'm on a leave of absence.
Forced vacation.

Yeah, I will.

out of that sentence,
nobody returns your phone calls.

What am I hooked on?

The rush of 60 Minutes?

What the hell for?
"Infotainment"!

Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.

No, you do not.

From my perspective,

It's half-measures.
You're not listening.


[ Beeping Stops ]

I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone.

without Jeff ran,

Hello?
Yeah, I'm here.

Less than great.

I'm about out of moves,
Dick.

[ Doorbell Jangling ]

[Doorbell Jangling]

Hi.

Yeah?
Really?

How about you?

I work for CBS News.

Oh, yeah?

Lowell, do not...
screw this up.

So I'll hold it. And?

You got a deal.

I believe that nicotine

I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

because I watched those

There was this

Part of the reason I'm here
is that I felt...

that their representation--

Hello?
-Jim, it's Lowell.

You asked me if we were

You mean, 60 Minutes

decide what is
or is not news?

What's Wallace think
about this? Or Hewitt, or--

Oh, come on, Lowell. This is
The New York Times. I don't know.

They will not
air an interview.

Call me back in ten.

[Phone Ringing]

Hello?
Debbie, it's me.

Hi.
What time is it?

Oh, it's late.
That I know. When are you coming back?

What is it?

[Phone Ringing]

Hello?
It's Lowell.

Here's how it works. You ask me
questions. I tell you if you're wrong.

You ready?

Lowell?
Did I tell you you were wrong?

Are we talking, uh--

[ Wallace ]
Did I get you up?

sleepy look on my face.

That's right.

But in all that time,
Mike,

and find that a source
for a story changed his mind?

Lost his heart?
Walked out on us?

I'm gonna tell you why.

Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage...

Give me a break.
You give me a break.

I never left a source
hung out to dry ever.

Abandoned.
Not till right fucking now.

What the hell
did you expect?

You expect me to lie down?

Back off?
Or get over it?

Like what?
Corporate responsibility?

What, are we talking celebrity here?
I'm not--

I'm--
I'm talking about...

What future? No.

What you think is...

after I'm gone?"

I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building...

all that.

And should that be
fronting a segment...

Does it give someone...

at my time of life pause?

Yeah.

Mike,

You and I

of what went on
inside our shop.

And in the editorial,

if I can find him.

You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

There are times I feel com--
compelled to do it.

If you ask me...

Yeah, I think it's worth it.

You won.

Yeah.

What did I win?

CBS News has learned
that a remote home site...

outside of Lincoln, Montana...

has been under F.B.I.
surveillance for several weeks.

Great, Lowell.

Thanks for this.

You know, we beat everybody.

That Canada story...

Everything interests me.

Uh, I quit, Mike.

Bullshit.

Come on.

It all worked out.

I did?

What do I tell a source

No.

So, uh--
