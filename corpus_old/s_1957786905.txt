Soto Health, this is Cassy.
Hi, Claire.

Yeah, he's drinking
tons and tons of water.

I'm making sure of it.
No, yeah, don't worry about it.

Yeah, I'll totally...
I got it, I'll check on him.

Yeah. For sure. Okay, bye.

Hi, Dom. Happy holidays.
Cassy.

Hey, I know I'm 15 minutes
early, but it's kind of important,

so if he isn't doing anything, I'd
rather not wait and get straight to it.

Okay, let me check in with him.

Dom's here,
he says it's important.

If you're available now,
should I send him in?

Uh, just have him wait.
It's not quite time yet.

Yeah, thank you, Cassy.

Does he make you wear that hat?
Why?

'Cause I can't share the holiday
spirit of my own volition?

No, no. Just seemed like
one of those Jorge things.

Well, I'll have you know
it was a joint decision.

This year's theme is inclusion. We
wanna make sure no one's left out.

Chinese, Muslims, Jews,
Hindus, everyone's holiday

is as worthy of attention
as Christmas.

What about Kwanzaa?
Who?

Soto Health, this is...
Fuck off, Andrew!

I told you
not to call me at work.

My creeper ex.
I only went out with him

because he's like 12 feet tall, so
I figured he'd have a 12-inch dick,

but turns out proportions
don't work that way.

And he has a crazy Korean
fetish.

Memorized lyrics to all these
K-pop songs I don't even know,

watches all the dramas.

He even tried buying me
a Korean school girl outfit.

Can you imagine me
in a school girl uniform?

I can only imagine.
Anyway, I like it.

Keeps my head warm.

Besides, it adds
to the overall cheer.

Is he actually doing something
or is he just sitting in there?

You've known him
the longest, you tell me.

Soto Health, this is Cassy.

Hi, Ms. Rottenstein,
how can I help you?

Sure. Okay, Monday.

<i>Mayeda Realtors, this is Rita.</i>

Hey, it's me.
<i>- Dom, where the hell did you go?</i>

<i>I had Darius Ebner in here expecting
to be shown the Rowley house,</i>

<i>but surprise, you're not here.</i>

<i>- Also, isn't this the house that Jorge wants?</i>
Shit.

I'll call him later,
can you reschedule him?

<i>I already did to tomorrow, 'cause
you'll be here in the office tomorrow.</i>

<i>Why can't you leave a note?
Or use the spoken word?</i>

<i>"Hey, Rita, I'm leaving."
No, you can't.</i>

<i>- You have an appointment!</i>
Okay, I'm sorry.

Look, uh, I'll leave a note
next time.

Look, if Lisa calls looking
for me, can you tell her...

<i>Lisa's already called
looking for you.</i>

<i>I told her I don't know where you are
because I don't know where you are.</i>

Well, if she calls again, just
tell her I'm meeting a client.

<i>- Which client?</i>
Uh, a new one.

<i>Thank you for making my job
harder by not telling me anything</i>

<i>- and making me lie to your wife.</i>
Rita, please, can you...

I'm dealing with something
right now, okay? Thank you.

Trust me, proportions
don't work like that.

You remember how tall
Andrew was?

Well, "disappointed"
isn't even the right word.

Wait, let me put you on hold.

Yes? Will do.

Dom? Dom?

Dominic, the highlight
of my week.

You were just sitting there, weren't you?!
Oh, come on.

Jorge, I really need your advice

and you made me sit
outside for 15 minutes,

looking at a book
of nude women with scars!

Hey, what do you think of it?

I had to drive through
a mile of smoke to get here!

Okay, don't yell at me,
I didn't start the fire.

Would you sit down already?

Arguing is not good for your
mental and physical health.

What did I tell you about that?

Why do you have that anyway?

What?
The scars book.

Oh, that's... Claire's
getting lipo for her birthday,

so she thought it would help prepare
me, you know, in case of any scarring.

Isn't that dangerous? I thought
the mortality rate was absurdly high,

like one in 5,000 or something?
Oh, no, that was the '90s lipo.

Besides, I made sure she's going
to the best surgeons in the country.

You know, I could not live
without her.

Right, that's why you divorced her.
Hmm.

Symbolically. But we never
went through the paperwork.

But you know what? She's a totally different
person ever since we got back together.

I'm talking about going
from Roman Catholic, uptight,

and super jealous of any woman
near me

to doing witchcraft
and be so trusting.

She's the one who actually
introduced me with Cassy, you know?

Hey, by the way, when can
we tour that Rowley house?

Claire really wants the house,
you know?

Yeah, yeah. Listen, these pills you
gave me, they don't calm me down,

they just make me tired as shit.
Hey, don't take one, then.

Come on, here.

These are uppers, these will
cancel out the downer you just took.

Do you have any water?
No.

Um, just take it dry,
feels better.

Yeah. Oh, and these.

These, my friend,
are the new Prozac in town.

What are they?
Oh, they're called fen-phen.

They makes you alert,
gives you dopamine.

Are they safe to mix? What are the other ones?
Oh, come on, Dom.

I'm not gonna give you
anything I won't take myself.

Hmm? See?

Just take it. There you go.

Wow.

So what's new in real estate?

I've been having dreams.

What kind of dreams?
So I'm in the middle of the country somewhere,

I drive up
to an auto repair shop,

which is a combination
of Costco gas station lines

and driveways that lead
up to an auto garage,

and there was the worker, the guy
at that one Jiffy Lube that rips you off.

Yeah, all Jiffy Lubes rip you off.
I know, those fuckers.

Anyway, I left and went to
go to my car. It was gone.

I go to the manager's office
and my car had been towed.

There in the tow section,
I clicked my car remote

for my car to honk
so I could locate it

and I found it was crushed
between two other vehicles.

And how did that make you feel?
I was devastated.

I felt so helpless.

So then the guy from Pert London
shows up, somehow he works there too,

and then I beg him to release my car
because I have no money to pay for it,

and I'm in the middle
of nowhere.

But instead of empathizing
with me,

they start making fun of me for being Caribbean.
What do you mean?

Like, making racist
Jamaican jokes and stuff.

But you're not Jamaican.
I know, but in the dream I was,

and I was really offended
by their remarks.

Anyway, that part might not really be
relevant. I'm just telling you because...

The relevance of dreams
isn't so much in the details

as in the emotions
and reactions to them.

See, because
the subconscious emotions...

...can be the manifestations
of real life concerns

that you might be experiencing.
It's Rita, I'll just...

Hey, you know what to do,
put her on the speaker phone.

Seriously?
Yeah, no secrets here.

This space is only for truth.

Rita?
<i>- Lisa called again, I told her what you said to tell her</i>

<i>and she said to let you know
she's on her way</i>

<i>to Burbank Airport
and to call her back.</i>

O-kay.
<i>- Dom, what's going on?</i>

<i>- Why are you avoiding your wife?</i>
Thank you.

<i>Dom, you have...</i>

Dom, why are you not talking
to Lisa?

Let me tell you something, the road
to hell is paved with ignoring your wife.

I mean,
Claire always calls Cassy.

But if she called myself, I
would not dare not to pick it up.

Yeah, well, I'll get to that.

In my second dream, I'm
being chased through the city

by a Hispanic couple,
man and a woman.

Hispanic or Latino?

I don't know the difference.

Well, today, Hispanic
generally refers to anyone

of Spanish speaking origin,
including Spain.

But some people say
it doesn't include Brazil

since they speak Portuguese.

But they count as Latino, so.

This is... for some people, this is
a matter of preference, you know?

Me, can be Latino, Hispanic,
doesn't matter.

I don't think they were Brazilian.
Okay.

Anyway, in my dream I have
the power to warp through walls

by crashing into them and entering
a void space where they can't see me

but I can see through the walls
to them.

And I can also fly,
though very slowly.

I move a few feet with each flap of
my arms, and at the mercy of the wind.

I know the couple wanted me in connection to
something, but I don't remember what it is.

I know only the feeling
of narrowly escaping them,

floating just out their reach
from the window of a high rise,

watching them watching me
as I escape through the air,

over the wide ocean between us.

And then I wake up.

Okay, so how does this relate
to you not talking to Lisa?

You don't see it?
This is the Pert London deal.

My car represents the company
they're taking away from me.

And the whole laughing at me
for being Jamaican

is them laughing at a foreigner,
AKA the British laughing at me

because they know
I'm being played.

Ah.
The Hispanic woman is Lisa!

Trevor, one of the Pert
London partner, is Hispanic!

Come on.
I wasn't paying attention to the signs when I was awake,

but in here, subconsciously,
I'm picking it up.

Lisa being Hispanified means
she's leaving me for Trevor,

the Hispanic Pert London guy.

I can't go through
with this deal now!

Dom, that's not how dreams work.

What do you mean? You said it
yourself, they're the subconscious

manifestations of real-life
concerns.

Yeah, but emotions
of real-life concerns

doesn't mean they're evidence
of anything.

And I said, "Sometimes." Sometimes
doesn't mean anything at all.

So you think my brain's giving
me these scenarios at random?

The fact that Pert London
is in both of them is random?

The Hispanic guy chasing me
and Trevor from Pert London

just happening to be
Hispanic is meaningless too?

You think this is just coincidental bullshit?
I don't know, Dom!

I only took psychology
one semester in college.

I'm a goddamn accountant,
remember?

Look, you're welcome to come here
anytime you want and talk things through.

But if you're having some
serious doubts about your marriage,

then you need to go see
a professional.

Why don't you and Lisa go see
a marriage counselor, huh?

Someone specially trained
to help you through

whatever you are going through
in life.

It's too late.

She's about to be on a plane
to London.

Well, do it after that trip.
I don't think she's coming back.

Oh, keep ignoring her phone
calls and you might be right.

A month ago, we had a sit down
with Pert London.

<i>It was me, Lisa,
and their two partners,</i>

<i>including Trevor.</i>

<i>Lisa bought coffee
for everyone...</i>

<i>and when she gave Trevor his...</i>

<i>I saw a look between them.</i>

Oh, yeah? And did her eyes pop out
like Bugs Bunny and stretch to his penis?

Hey, I have a photographic
memory. I know what I saw, okay?

There's a difference between
looking and "looooking."

Yeah, okay, you said it
longer the second time.

Okay, so you have
photographic memory, right?

What's the prescription number
on this bottle?

77835196-B.

Correct. But you didn't notice
that it doesn't say my name.

It says Kate.

Who's that?
That's not the point.

The point is that
you might have perfect memory,

but you only seeing the details
that you wanna see.

See? And that's distorting
the bigger picture.

Let me ask you something,
has Lisa given you

any actual indications that she
was unhappy with her marriage?

Or this is just because of a look or
your silly dream about her being Hispanic?

Yes, Lisa's been distant lately.

I don't remember the last time
she said "I love you" on the phone.

Well, do you say that to her?

There's one more thing...

I get real-time alerts
on all our credit cards

for any charges over $50.

Look at the most recent one.

Seventy-seven dollars, Wendy's.

Fuck, for how many people?

No, no, no.
The one above it.

Oh, 366, KKO Airways.

That's a one-way ticket price.

Well, people buy one-way
tickets all the time, just to be safe.

Besides, don't you both
have family in London?

I mean, it makes sense, she wants
to set extra time to see them, right?

No, that might not be anything
out of the ordinary by itself,

but add on everything else
I just told you?

I need to talk to your friend before
I lose my company along with Lisa.

The divorce lawyer, Rodan or something?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

You are not divorcing your wife
over premonitions, dreams, or looks.

I don't care how stretched out
you say that word.

We're gonna set you up with
a marriage counselor right now

because you are not
thinking straight.

And when Lisa comes back
from London, which she will...

You're picking that up right now.
I can't.

No, wait!

You've reached Dominic Mayeda,
please leave a message.

<i>Dom, it's me.
I'm at the airport and I've just found</i>

<i>that my binder with all the
Pert London documents</i>

<i>is not in my suitcase.
Check my desk.</i>

<i>They don't take facsimile, so you'll
have to mail it to the PLP's office.</i>

<i>I'll be at my parents' tomorrow
and then with Pert the day after,</i>

<i>so it needs to be mailed Next Day
Air today to get there on time, okay?</i>

<i>Bye.</i>

What the hell is wrong with you?

I took it out of the suitcase.

What?
The binder with the document.

I took it out last night
while she was asleep.

Oh, my God.
I know what this is.

Jorge, if I'm right about this, then...
This is a mid-life crisis.

What? No, it's not.
Yes. Trust me, I've been through this too.

That's one of the reasons
I separated from Claire.

Love always changes over time.

It's either growing or dying,
there's no in between.

But you know what I learned
since I got back together with her?

You get a say in that!

Love isn't always about not
being able to live without someone.

Sometimes it's choosing not to live
without them, even when you can.

Huh, that almost sounds wise.

You like the second part? A Jehovah's
Witness said it to me over the weekend.

Same guy tried to get me to
invite him inside for three years.

<i>Este cabron</i> never gives up.

Damn.
All right, so now we gotta go.

All right, let's go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

What are you doing?
Up, up, up. Put your shoes on.

Shoes on. You gotta
go home, get the binder,

mail it before the post office
closes.

Jorge?
Yes.

Cassy, can you give Dom
a candy cane for the road?

I don't want a candy cane.
Okay, um, the fire's moved west,

so they just closed down the five in both
directions, so there's no way to get south.

So all your
appointments are canceled.

Hey, can you check if the
fire's near Rowley and Balboa?

There's a house there
that Claire and I were...

Oh, God. It's too late.
What have I done?

Excuse me.

Can I see a doctor, please?

I've been walking and I think
I breathed in smoke.

I can't stop coughing.

Oh, this is an accounting office,
ma'am, there's no doctor here.

I don't understand,
it says Health Clinic outside.

No, it says Accounting Clinic,
ma'am.

As in financial health
if you need a money doctor.

Otherwise,
you need a real doctor.

I got sick last year,
and now I got pneumonia,

and I've just got very...
Cassy.

It's over.

I can't return the binder now
even if I wanted to.

The deal's gonna fall through
after everything we worked for,

and now Lisa's
definitely gonna divorce me.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Listen to me, buddy.
It's not too late, okay?

Yes, it is. The highway's
closed. The post office will close.

You know I started this company
before we were married.

It was just me and a computer.
I know. I know.

I need to prepare
my divorce options, Jorge.

Let me at least keep my company.
Let me talk to Rudoy.

No, no, no...
Let me talk to her!

Ay!

<i>Puta madre!</i>

Okay, you know what?

Fine.

I'm gonna call her right now
and she's gonna calm you down.

Okay?
What the hell was that?

Did you see that?
Ah, it's just cramps.

It happens.

Here.

Take one, too, it's gonna calm
your nerves.

Anyways, she's seen it all.

She knows what a real
failed marriage looks like

and she's gonna tell you it's all
your nerves because this is what it is.

It's all nerves. I mean,
your company being bought.

You know, Lisa going away
on a trip, these goddamn fires.

Ashes everywhere. I mean,
how can you not be anxious?

<i>You have reached Melanie Rudoy.</i>

<i>Leave a message or I will
never, ever return your call.</i>

Hey, Mel, it's Jorge. Can you
call me back at the office please?

It's important, okay? Bye.

Jorge, are you sure those pills
are safe to mix?

Look at me, I'm sweating.
It's fine, it's just the stress.

Here.

I'm sweating too.

Hello?

<i>Jorge, hello. Hey, I got 15
minutes before my next meeting,</i>

<i>just so you know.</i>

Yeah, that's no problem,
uh, I'll be quick.

Listen, I got you
on the speaker phone

with my buddy, Dominic,
and he's a little worried,

you know, about his wife
and, you know, I mean

how she's going away
on a business trip without him.

<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
So it's all nerves, you know?

But I think that it will
make him feel better

if someone with your expertise
can give him some perspective

because you know
when there's real trouble.

<i>Of course, of course.
He's there right now?</i>

Yeah, he can hear you,
go ahead, Dom.

Hi, this is Dominic.
<i>- Hello, Dominic.</i>

<i>This is Melanie Rudoy.</i>

<i>You can call me Mel
or Rudoy, but not easy.</i>

<i>So you are worried
your wife is going</i>

<i>to cheat on you during this
business trip, is that correct?</i>

Well, the thing is I saw
a look between...

Forget the fucking look!

Look, long story short,
he and his wife are selling

their real estate company
to a bigger one in London,

so she's flying there to close
the deal,

but he thinks that she's gonna be
leaving him for a guy at the London office

because they don't say "I love
you" on the phone anymore.

And she hasn't bought
her return ticket yet.

Well, it's a little more...
<i>- You don't say "I love you" on the phone to each other?</i>

Not for a while now.

Because we work together

and when we started
getting more business...

<i>Well, you know, that happens
to couples sometimes.</i>

<i>You just get busy and you start
to overlook little things like that.</i>

<i>I don't think it means your
relationship is dead or anything.</i>

<i>You should just try saying it to
her next time you talk on the phone</i>

<i>and maybe she'll start
saying it again.</i>

That's exactly what I told him.
See, didn't I tell you that?

<i>Also, people buy one-way tickets
all the time for this type of things.</i>

<i>Let me ask you, though, why
aren't you going with your wife?</i>

<i>- What is her name?</i>
Lisa.

<i>Okay, Lisa. Why aren't you
going with Lisa to do this deal</i>

<i>if you don't like that
she's traveling by herself?</i>

I can't, I don't do well
on planes.

<i>- Why? You get sick or something?</i>
No, I just...

It's just a phobia, you know?

I mean, I know a guy
who's afraid of hot dogs

because they look very much
like penises to him.

<i>Oh, so like a homophobia, huh?</i>

No, I'm not homophobic.
It's just planes. Uh...

<i>I'm kidding.</i>

<i>So basically,
you don't trust Lisa?</i>

Well, it's not that I don't
trust her, it's just, I feel like a...

It's just,
this is what I'm telling him,

Mel, it's all feelings, nerves.

She hasn't actually done
anything to be suspicious,

it's all in his head.

<i>Look, it's not about
her doing something.</i>

<i>She's cheating or not cheating,
if he's not sure,</i>

<i>that's a problem that you
can't just think away.</i>

<i>He has to be sure.
Simple.</i>

<i>- So when is her trip?</i>
Oh, she's already at the airport.

<i>Okay.
And you dropped her off?</i>

I didn't.
<i>- Why not?</i>

Oh, I mean I offered,

but she just said
she would just take a cab.

<i>Well, that's suspicious.</i>

It is?
What do you mean?

What's suspicious about that,
Mel?

It's so he could be
at the office.

<i>Hey, look, you called me.</i>

<i>I drive my husband to the
airport and he drives me.</i>

<i>I would be suspicious
if he refused.</i>

<i>Sometimes people don't want
to be driven</i>

<i>because they don't want
their spouses to find out</i>

<i>they're meeting someone else
or going somewhere else</i>

<i>they don't say they're going.
Things like that.</i>

You think so?
Oh, hold on.

Let's not jump in
to any conclusions here.

<i>No, we don't jump to anything.</i>

<i>We just make sure, simple.</i>

<i>I have to go,
but I'll give you the number</i>

<i>of someone that can make sure
for you.</i>

<i>He's retired now, but he was
a great PI back in the day</i>

<i>when I worked with him.</i>

<i>Just tell him I sent you his way</i>

<i>and he will give you
a good rate, okay?</i>

<i>- You have a pen?</i>
Wait, you mean go to the airport?

Hold on, I don't know
if that's really necessary.

<i>I decide when it's time
for him to come in.</i>

<i>Look, Jorge, I'll text the
number to you, I have a client.</i>

Wait, wait, Mel...
<i>- Also, Dominic, don't use your cell phone to call him.</i>

<i>We don't want Lisa to see
the call on the phone bill, okay?</i>

<i>- Good luck.</i>
Okay.

Great, now we have
the phone number

of a guy we can send over
to spy Lisa at the airport.

Fucking unbelievable.

We have to do it.
Are you fucking kidding me, Dom?

I mean, hiring a guy to spy
on your wife

is something you do
if you find, like, love letters

or, uh, credit cards in a motel
you've never been to.

Not because fucking
silly dreams about flying

or being Jamaican or whatever.
It's not just the dreams.

It was a fucking look!
Okay, don't yell at me!

I'm trying to help you out.

You don't even know how much this guy costs.
I know.

Look, maybe I'm having
a mid-life crisis.

Maybe it's just stress
and it's all in my mind.

But Melanie's right,
it's not gonna go away

if I just stop thinking
about it.

The simplest thing
is to do is to find out.

If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.

Make sure you ask how
much he charges first, okay?

<i>Hey-lo!</i>

Hi, is this, uh...

I'm sorry, we didn't get
your name.

I'm Jorge and this is Dominic.
Um...

We're friends of Mel Rudoy.
She gave us your phone number.

<i>Aw, Mel? Definitely had some
exciting times working with her.</i>

<i>Well, you got the right number. I'm Charlie,
my friends call me Chuck, or Chucky,</i>

<i>or Chuck-a-latte.</i>

<i>Nah, I'm just joking.</i>

<i>So, uh, hey, how can I help
you gentlemen?</i>

Well, it's kind of
a time sensitive matter.

<i>- Hold on, how time sensitive?</i>
Uh...

Can you get to Burbank Airport
in like 30 minutes or so?

<i>Oh, extremely fucking time
sensitive. Okay, I'll tell you what.</i>

<i>I'm gonna grab some stuff,
get in the car,</i>

<i>I'm gonna call you back
as soon as I get on the road,</i>

<i>and you guys can shoot
all the details onto me.</i>

Okay, sure.
<i>- All right, Jorge, you said, right?</i>

And Dom. Dominic, Dom.

<i>All right, Dominic or Dom,
talk soon.</i>

Okay, we're doing it.

You didn't even ask
how much he charges.

It will be a good rate,
you heard Mel.

Fine. Fine. Fine. If that
makes you feel better, then hey.

You know what?
I do feel better.

I think maybe I just needed
to do something about it.

You know?
Hey, speaking of doing something,

you better call somebody
right now

and get the binder from your place.
Oh, shit.

Wait, shouldn't we wait
for Charlie?

I mean, I'm not saying he's
gonna find anything, but...

We'll wait actually for him
to mail it,

but at least have it ready.

Right. I think I know.

What are you doing?
You cannot use your phone.

Why not?
You heard Mel.

What about if Lisa asks you
if she sees the phone number

on the phone bill?
I'm calling my cousin.

What's it matter if she sees
that number?

I don't know, Dom.
What about if she ask about it?

You couldn't call her because
you were meeting a client,

but you calling your cousin
instead?

I don't know, Dom,
it's... it's up to you.

<i>Hello?</i>
Frances. Hey, it's Dom.

<i>Dom? Where are you
calling from?</i>

<i>- I don't have this number.</i>
It's an office line.

Hey, you're not busy, are you?
I need kind of a big favor.

<i>- Depends on what the favor is.</i>
Okay, so Lisa left a binder at home

that contains very important
documents

that I need you fetch
and possibly mail.

<i>- Right now?</i>
Yes, before the post office closes.

It needs to get to London
before a meeting.

<i>I can't, I'm going out tonight.</i>

<i>Your place is 40 minutes
from me.</i>

<i>W-Why can't you do it yourself?
Where... Where are you?</i>

It's not 40 to my place,
it's 15 max.

<i>Yeah, it is, with rush hour
and all the fires around town,</i>

<i>it's 40 minimum, mate.</i>

<i>What about Rita, who gets
paid to do work for ya?</i>

I can't. Look, you're the only
person I can trust with this right now.

Everyone else is gone
for the holidays.

<i>Exactly, Dom, it's the holidays.</i>

<i>Once a year, I get to go
to parties I actually enjoy.</i>

<i>You know I love ya, but I'm
not missing it for your wife.</i>

This isn't just Lisa...
<i>- I don't understand...</i>

It might be Charlie
on the other line.

<i>...she's actually getting paid
to do this kind of shit...</i>

Sorry, let me call you
right back.

Hello?
-<i>Claire says to make sure you're drinking water.</i>

<i>And are you expecting
a call from a Chuckzilla?</i>

Uh, yes and yes.
Put him through.

<i>Uh, yeah, Dom?</i>
Yes, and Jorge.

That was Jorge, this is Dom.
<i>- All right, Dom and Jorge.</i>

<i>Listen, I should be there in
less than 15. Lay it all over me.</i>

I need to find out
if my wife is... I don't...

If she's even there, I guess. I
didn't drive her to the airport.

<i>Wait, is she supposed
to be getting there</i>

<i>or is she already inside
the gate?</i>

Inside the gate. She likes to
be at the boarding door early.

<i>Okay, I'll have to buy a
ticket. Which flight is it?</i>

Uh, one second.

KKO, flight 226.

Stops over in San Francisco
before London.

You can return it, right?
<i>- I don't know, I'm just gonna get</i>

<i>the cheapest thing I can
get just to get in the gate.</i>

<i>Unless you want me to board the plane?</i>
No, no, no, no, no.

You don't need to board
the plane.

He doesn't need
to board that plane.

Yeah, you don't have to board.

Just find out
if she's actually there,

or with anyone,
or anything like that.

<i>Okay, send me a text
with her photo</i>

<i>and a description
of her clothing.</i>

<i>I'm gonna hang up
and buy a ticket right now</i>

<i>so I can beeline
through security.</i>

Give me his number.
What are you doing?

I'm sending him a picture
of Lisa.

What?
You cannot use your phone.

Well, I can't send a picture
through this fucking thing.

Yeah, well, you can email it,
right?

Do you have his email?
No.

Then give me his fucking
number! It's one text!

I'm not the one being
suspected of cheating here.

I'm just thinking ahead, okay?
Here.

You know, if Lisa isn't cheating,
then spying on her like this

is as bad as cheating yourself.

You know?
No, it isn't.

I'd be flattered if I found out
Lisa was stalking me,

or at least paying someone to.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But the problem with suspicion

is that the moment you act
on them,

doesn't matter
what the outcome is,

trust is already damaged,

the relationship is
just no longer the same.

Hey, your cousin.
Right.

<i>Dom, I told ya,
I'm sorry, but I just...</i>

Wait, let me claim this favor coupon.
<i>- A what coupon?</i>

The favor coupon you gave me
when I saw you in London

for one favor.
I have it right here.

<i>What the hell are you...?</i>

<i>Oh, my God, you mean
the "forgive me" coupon?</i>

Huh.
<i>- Bloody hell, I gave that to you when I was like six.</i>

<i>- Why do you still have it?</i>
I don't know, I get sentimental

about stuff I have
in my wallet for a long time.

Anyway, I'm cashing it in, so...
<i>- First off,</i>

<i>if I didn't emphasize it
enough the first time,</i>

<i>I gave that to you
when I was six.</i>

<i>Second, even if I chose
to honor that thing,</i>

<i>it's a "forgive me" coupon.</i>

<i>So I'll forgive you for
attempting something so stupid.</i>

Yeah, I'll give you one
in return.

You can use it for any favor
you want.

Frances, please,
I'm begging you!

Hello?
<i>- I want five favor coupons.</i>

Five?

<i>- Is that a yes or a no?</i>
All right, yes.

<i>Fuck's sake, fine, I'll give you
a call when I get to your place.</i>

Yes.

Thank you.

<i>You owe me so much after this.</i>

<i>I'm going to miss
a Christmas raffle</i>

<i>with actual good prizes
this year.</i>

Come on, you never win those.

At least I saved you
wasting your money on it.

<i>I've already bought
the bloody ticket!</i>

<i>You know what?
I want 10 favor coupons.</i>

Wait, we already agreed!
<i>- Ten!</i>

Oh, fuck.

God fucking damn it!

What the... fuck did you give me?!
Calm down!

Calm down! Hey!
Why do you have so many pills?!

Calm the hell down!
Calm... calm down!

Calm down!

What the fuck is wrong with you?

Jorge?

Jorge, what the fuck?!

Is that the drugs?
Is that gonna happen to me?

It's nothing, trust me,
it's just stress.

Hey, it's Mel.

<i>I just called your cell.
</i>- Call my office number, not my cell.

<i>Why not?
Is Claire going to be jealous?</i>

No, she trusts me completely,
okay?

Those calls goes through Cassy,
that's how we do things.

<i>Okay, okay, I'm just
clutching your balls.</i>

<i>Did you call Charlie?
Is Dom still there with you?</i>

Dom?

Hello?
<i>- Hello, Dom, did you call Charlie?</i>

Yeah, he's on his way
to the airport right now.

<i>Good.</i>

Hey, how much does
this guy charge anyway?

<i>Depends on the job, but he'll
give you a good rate, don't worry.</i>

What the hell is a good rate?

I mean, we didn't even sign
any forms before he took it on.

<i>- Jorge, it'll be fine.</i>
Okay, I'm just saying, I know he's your guy and all,

but we're not paying
if it's unreasonable.

<i>Eh, come on,
it'll be reasonable.</i>

<i>Just don't jilt him,
he's going to end up hiring me</i>

<i>to sue you both.</i>

<i>I'm kidding, I only do divorces.</i>

<i>- Let me know how it goes.</i>
Okay.

Are you sure
you don't want half of this?

Claire makes the best
corned beef sandwiches.

Hey, you trust her right?

Mel?

She knows what she's talking
about.

She's a character, though.

Hey, you'll never guess
how I met her.

Well, guess.
I don't fucking know. On a cruise?

At the BDSM club.

You mean like whips and people
having sex all tied up?

No, no, no, no, no.
They were not having sex.

It's just the theme of the club,
you know?

Like costumed dancing.

There were some people
having sex there too.

She's into that, huh?
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

What were you doing there?
Claire.

I told you, a completely different woman.
What happened?

I mean, you said she's
like a witch or something?

Well, I think deep down
inside there is magic in all of us.

You know, maybe we are like
witches to some extent.

But you know what I think?

I think that you and Lisa
just need something new

in your relationship.

You ever talk about having kids?

We've had the kids talk already.

Okay, well if you're not
having kids,

then you should spice
things up in the bedroom.

You know? Ah, here.

This is the place.

I promise you it's fucking
fantastic.

I don't know,
Lisa's not like that.

Like what? Into sex?

You're always telling me she's a smart one.
So?

So it's very well documented
that the more intelligent

the person is,
the more pervert they are.

Huh, yeah!

Bill Gates?

The biggest pervert.

I know it.
What?

I mean, just look at Japan.

One of the most advanced
nations in the world,

so far ahead of United States
in terms of technology

and societal efficiency.

Have you seen a Japanese porn?

I mean, I've...

It's crazy.

Things you'll never dream of.

Oh, my God, okay, they have one

where they have
this scientist there, right?

And he builds this device
to stop time

so he can use it
at a superhero yoga class.

So...

Are you kidding me?
Superhero yoga class?

Oh, my.

America have no imagination
in comparison.

For you guys, it's all like penis
and vagina, penis and vagina.

Oh, I mean, I can't even get
a hard-on

seeing a vagina anymore.

For me, it's just like, oh,
looking at someone's armpit.

Hello?
-<i>I have Chuck-E-Cheeses on the line.</i>

Ah?
<i>- That Kentucky guy that called earlier.</i>

Oh, is he really from Kentucky?

<i>- I don't know.</i>
Yes, put him through.

<i>Hey, Dom and Jorge.</i>
Charlie, did you find her?

<i>Based on the photos
you sent me, I'm 95% sure</i>

<i>that I'm eyeballing her
right now.</i>

Okay, so she definitely
wasn't lying about the flight.

<i>Yeah, she's sitting next
to a guy in a suit right now.</i>

Is he Hispanic?!
<i>- Not sure, could be Chicano, but I ain't racist,</i>

<i>so I can't really say.</i>

Send us a picture!

Soto Health, this is Ca...

I swear to God, Andrew,
it's over.

I hope this brush fire
moves in your direction

and burns down only your house
with you inside.

Afternoon, miss.

Are you here on a real
official police business

or is this just an excuse
to see me?

Real police business, but, um, when
are you gonna let me take you out?

How tall are you?

Hold on one second.
Hold on one second.

Are you sure this is him?

I don't care! Get on the
fucking plane, Charlie!

<i>Okay, listen...</i>

One sec. Yes?

Sorry to interrupt, the
police just came by to tell us

they're doing voluntary
evacuations in this area.

Nah, that's just for old people.

Tell us if it becomes mandatory.

Okay, will do.
Have you been drinking water?

All right, Charlie, so walk us
through what to expect here.

You said you had a plan
for this exact scenario?

<i>Yeah, listen, I don't have a lot of
time to get a ticket for this flight.</i>

<i>Call Melanie and tell her
we're doing Hoolagarification.</i>

What?
<i>- Hoolagarification on a plane. She'll explain everything.</i>

<i>Just sit tight
and if everything goes to plan,</i>

<i>this whole thing will be in the
bag once we land in San Francisc...</i>

What's Melanie's number?
Hoola-what?

Jorge, what's her number?
I'll dial it.

Calm down.

<i>You have reached Melanie Rudoy.</i>

<i>Leave a message or I will
never, ever return your call.</i>

It's Dom, from Jorge's office.

Hoola...
Hoolagalination.

On a plane.
On a plane.

God damn it!

Dom, as your only friend...

I trusted her!

She was the one pushing
for this deal, you know?

That's why I let her take
a lead in this whole affair,

and now she's having an affair!

Relax.

You heard Charlie.

He and Melanie
have a Hoolagalant plan

that's gonna make things right.

Just, you have to be patient.

Hey, here, here.
Have some of my sandwich.

It has Vicodin in it.
No, Jorge!

I'm tired of your unbridled,
optimistic,

"everything's gonna be okay"
bullshit!

Everything's not gonna be okay!
Well, keep yelling at me

because it's gonna solve
everything.

My God, look what she's doing
to me.

My heart's beating
outta my chest. It hurts.

I think I'm having
a heart attack.

That's just the uppers.

What?
You said it wasn't the pills!

It's not pills. I mean...

Look at all that smoke
in the distance.

We're probably breathing it
and we don't even know it.

Why isn't she calling back?

Hey, relax, it's been only
two minutes.

You act like we've been waiting
forever.

No, there's no such thing
as forever.

Wait, that window doesn't
open! No, no, no, no, no, no!

Get the fuck back!
I'll smash through it!

Don't do that.
You said it yourself, Jorge! I have a choice in all this.

And if I'm gonna lose
everything, it'll be on my terms!

But you have to live!
There's nothing to live for!

Yes, you have to live for a
chance to fight for what you love.

I mean, if you really love
Lisa, you're not gonna give up

on her no matter what.

Also, you promised me
you will get me a good deal

on the Rowley house
for a long time now.

Are you really gonna
jump out of that window

and break that promise after
everything I've done for you?

You know what?

Let me show you something.

I wasn't gonna tell anybody
about this,

but I think this is
the only thing

that's gonna de-stress you
right now.

Now I gotta tell you,
it might seem scary at first,

and I don't really know
how it works,

but this is some sort of like
hallucinogenic smoke or something.

But I've done it a bunch
of times with Claire

and it's completely safe,
so don't freak out.

Okay?

Don't worry.

It's... it's completely safe.

That's what he thinks.

Don't act like
you don't want it.

This little guy never lies.

What the fuck?

Oh, my God, what are you doing?

So you can just go right now.

Go, okay? I don't know.
Why are you even here?

I said I don't wanna talk
to you anymore!

Can you just go?
Yeah, go away.

Yeah, what are you saying?
Go away.

I just wanna talk.
No, Andrew leave before I call the cops.

I just wanna talk.
Hey, they asked you to leave, man.

Yeah, you gotta go.
You gotta go.

Why can't we just talk?
No.

You have to leave, right? Hey!

Hey!
Asshole!

You wanna get arrested?
Yeah, circus asshole.

Fine, I'm going.

Hey, what the...

Ew!

God!

You son of a bitch!

Hey, are you okay?
Yeah, thanks.

Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

So that was the ex-boyfriend?

Strong emphasis on the ex.

What happened to you?

Oh, I spilled some...

Jorge had this antique
whatever it was, it had some oil...

I have an extra shirt
if you want?

I was gonna spend the night
at my girlfriend's place tonight.

Oh, no, that's okay.
No, it's fine.

It's just a pajama shirt,
so it's oversized.

It should fit.

You can just give it back
whenever.

Thanks.

Jorge, I'm so sorry.

I never thought he'd show up
like that.

I swear, I'm gonna file
a restraining order on him.

Yeah, don't worry about it.

Okay? Hey, listen.

Orange chicken, and add
whatever you want there.

Hey, don't forget to lock
the front door

in case that comes back.

Got it.
Okay.

Any special requests?

For food?

Oh, not a picky eater.

Okay, cool.

By the way, I'm going out to
drinks with my friend tonight.

You two should meet.

I have a sixth sense
about that stuff.

I mean, it's not like
you can go home anyway,

the highway will probably still
be closed.

Well, you have a point there.

I guess I don't have a reason
not to.

Great, I'll see you later then.

You need to tell me what the fuck that
thing is and what just happened because...

I know, I know,
it's scary at first,

but trust me, it's the best
stress reliever.

How the fuck is that
a stress reliever?

Ah, you're telling me
it didn't get you off?

No, it didn't get me off,
you sick fuck.

Wow, I stopped you from
jumping out of that window.

Oh, I'm sorry you had a bad trip.
That wasn't a trip, Jorge.

That was some demonic shit!
Look at my goddamn neck!

Ha, those are tension marks.
I'm not tense, I was fucking choked.

Where'd you get that? Did
Claire give it to you? Did she?

So what?
So you said she does witchcraft,

that makes her a fucking witch.

Does she worship the devil too?

Oh, my God, am I possessed?
You know what?

I let you attack me because
you're under a lot of stress,

but I draw a line here
at insulting my wife.

If that's what you're gonna
be doing...

No, we gotta destroy this.
-Get off me, you fucking crazy bastard.

Get off! Get off!

Get off me!

Pick up the goddamn phone,
it might be Mel.

You pick it up, it's your phone.

You idiot, you're gonna
mess up the Hooligan plan.

Ow!

Shit, it's Frances. Hello?
Are you at my place?

Don't use your phone.
Fuck, let me call you right back.

<i>Why aren't you using your cell?</i>

It's... I'll tell you later.
But the house key...

<i>Yeah, I know, I'm already
inside. Some advice, though, yeah,</i>

<i>if you keep your spare key under a fake
stone, maybe put some real stones around it.</i>

Right, okay. Look, the documents
are in my laundry basket.

You'll see it, it's right by
the bed.

You meant on top
or in the basket?

Like in...

Underneath the clothes.
<i>- Oh, gross.</i>

<i>Should I even ask at this point?</i>

It's kind of complicated
right now.

Anyway, uh, the envelope's
in my desk. Um...

Address is on the header
of the document, Pert London.

<i>Right, okay.
I'll go and mail this now.</i>

<i>You want the fastest service
they have, right?</i>

Yeah, but here's the thing.
Uh...

I kind of need you to wait
for a bit until I call you to mail it

because I'm waiting on a call.

<i>- Well, how long is that?</i>
Like...

Maybe an hour?
<i>- An hour?</i>

Less than that.
Maybe 45 minutes.

<i>Ugh, you want me to sit here
on my arse</i>

<i>for 45 minutes waiting
for a phone call?</i>

<i>Are you taking the piss?</i>

I know, I know how it sounds.

But look, order some food,
order a movie,

do whatever you want there,
it's on me.

<i>Oh, yeah, whatever I want?
Well, I'll swipe someone on Tinder</i>

<i>and bugger a guy in your bed,
then, eh?</i>

I would rather you didn't,
but if that's what you want.

<i>Fucking hell, Dom, this
is mental, you know that?</i>

I know, but if there were
a time that I desperately needed

to use my family card, it's now.

So please do not mail it
until I call you to.

<i>All right, then, call me.</i>

Thank you.

Give me some of that.

I always wanted to ask,
why the hell do you call

your office Soto Health
Accounting Clinic?

Makes no sense.

For the search results
of course.

I am the number one Soto
business search result for this area.

And you know why?

Because "health clinic" is
such a popular search term,

so everybody's clicking
on my website.

What the fuck?
Dom?

Dom!
<i>- Dom, I got your message.</i>

<i>- What did Charlie tell you exactly?</i>
He didn't tell us anything.

What the hell
is a Hoolagalifinakis?

<i>Well, Hoolagarification
was a battle plan</i>

<i>Charlie and I used back in
the day to get the best deal</i>

<i>in a divorce by having Charlie
stake out on a trip</i>

<i>to record a cheating spouse
with their lover</i>

<i>and then serving the divorce
papers right on the trip</i>

<i>before they had any chance
to cover it up.</i>

<i>Like on a cruise, a plane,
or an airport, things like that.</i>

<i>Don't ask me about the name,
Charlie came up with it.</i>

Okay, so Charlie gets
all the evidence on the plane

and serves the papers
at the airport?

Then that gives me more say in
what happens with the company, right?

<i>Well, no, because this plan
doesn't work anymore.</i>

What do you mean it doesn't
work? You said you did it before.

<i>Yes, but that was
a long time ago.</i>

<i>I don't think Charlie realizes how
much laws have changed since he retired.</i>

<i>Now it's all no-fault divorce,
which means infidelity</i>

<i>really has no impact
in divorce proceedings</i>

<i>unless you specifically
signed a prenuptial agreement</i>

<i>with an infidelity clause.</i>

<i>Do you have a prenup?</i>

No, but...
Can't he sue them or something?

I mean, if one of their
partners is cheating with Lisa

and she's been pushing
to sell the company to them,

isn't that like illegal
conspiracy or something?

<i>More like just bad
fucking luck, unfortunately.</i>

<i>Look, if she hasn't closed
the deal yet</i>

<i>and you want to cancel,
then don't sign anything.</i>

<i>But bottom line is, Charlie
can come back with a sex tape</i>

<i>and she will still take
half of everything.</i>

Oh.
<i>- I know that might be difficult to hear, Dom.</i>

<i>But at least when Charlie lands,</i>

<i>you will know if Lisa's
cheating or not cheating on you.</i>

<i>Simple. Anyway, I have to
go, but best of luck to you</i>

<i>and let me know if you
end up filing for divorce.</i>

<i>I will give you good rate.</i>

<i>Jorge, I'll see you at the
club, huh? Maybe bring Dom.</i>

<i>I'm sure some Soft Corn will
help him forget about Lisa.</i>

And you are probably thinking
some bad thoughts right now.

But before you do anything,
just let me say

that we don't know
if she really is cheating

until the plane lands
and we hear from Charlie.

So right now, it's a kind
of a premature lamentation.

Okay, and you know what,
even if she's cheating,

which I still think she's not,

but if she is, there's plenty
fish in the water, right?

What about that girl
you met on the online game?

Cosmo, Cosmic?

And you know what,
also Cassy can help you out too.

Oh, she loves to set people up,

and she has a lot of very
young and beautiful friends.

Come on, Dom.

Hey, buddy, listen,
you cannot be hard on yourself.

I mean, at the end of the day, we're
all just animals trying to get our fix.

That's all love is, it's
chemicals swirling in our heads.

And who knows, maybe Lisa,
she has some chemical

imbalance right now,
and you cannot control that.

But you know what?

You know how we can
fight those bad chemicals

in your head right now?

Watch.

I have morphine pills.

Oh, this will cheer you
right up.

You don't need love.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

And these, oh, you know
what these are?

Oh, my God.

Hey, Dom,
you know what these are?

I got it from my nephew,

it's like some kind
of special Mexican LSD.

If you take this, you cannot be
sad. You maybe be a little scared,

if you're not in the right mindset,
but definitely not sad, okay?

Uh... You know what? You know what
these kids are calling it in the streets?

Oh, my God, they call it
<i>panocha de angel.</i>

Here, here, here, watch.
Oh.

Panocha de angel.
<i>Angel pussy.</i>

Jorge, thanks for everything.

You've been a good friend.
I'm going home.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You cannot go home.

The highway's still closed.
Still fire.

I'll go around it.
No, it's gonna take you forever.

Maybe hours.

Hey, why you don't stay
at my place?

I'm sure Claire
would love to have you over.

No, you've done enough already.

Okay, hey, listen,
it's not good to be alone

in this type of situation.

I'm not alone,
my cousin's at my house.

If you're worried about me
trying to off myself,

I'm pretty sure she'd try
to stop me.

Okay, okay, okay,
let's get your jacket.

You know how this fires make it
really windy outside.

I didn't bring a jacket.
See, that's why you cannot go home.

You cannot even remember what you
were wearing when you came in here.

You left it in the couch,
in my office.

Hey, I don't see a...
Swallow.

Swallow, Dominic.
I'm trying to save your life.

Swallow, the <i>panocha de angel.</i>
It's gonna help you out.

Listen to me, I'm doing this
to save your life.

Swa... Ow!

You're a fucking drug addict,
Jorge.

You know that?
You're a fucking drug addict.

I'm doing this to save you.
You...

are...

a... fucking... drug addict!

No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't break that!

Don't break that!
Fuck! <i>Puta madre</i>!

Claire is gonna kill me.

Poor baby.

Ah!

No, please don't eat my soul.

Don't worry,
I'm not that kind of a lover.

Please don't eat my brains.

That's a zombie, baby.

I don't do that either.

What... what are you?

I'm a succubus, honey.

We feast on the lust of a man.

Are you real
or am I hallucinating?

I don't know.

Does this feel like
a hallucination to you?

But I destroyed your box!

Demons don't possess objects,
baby.

They possess people.

But I saw you come out of it.

That's for show.

For Jorge.

To make him feel
more comfortable with me

and the deal I made
with his wife.

I keep him in check

and in return I get to snack.

Here and there.

How about you, Dom?

I can make you forget her.

Replace all those
hurtful memories...

with good ones.

You just have to say yes.

I can't. This is wrong.

It's not cheating

if Lisa's already doing it.

I don't even know
if she's really...

I need to hear from Charlie.

I won't know for sure
until the plane lands.

I need to wait for Charlie.

You're just putting off
the inevitable, Dom.

You already know the truth.

You saw it in the look.

No.
Remember?

No, I don't.
I don't know for sure.

Yes, you do.

Go ahead, call Frances.

Ask her the question
that's been burning

in the back of your mind.

The one you've been too afraid
to ask

the moment you thought of it.

<i>There you are.
Am I mailing this or what?</i>

Not yet, I'm still waiting
to hear back from someone.

<i>All right, whatever. I ended
up watching</i> Battlefield Earth

<i>and now I want to finish it.</i>

<i>Why do you have this on Blu-ray
anyway?</i>

Uh, it's Lisa's, not mine.

<i>Really?
She likes these kind of movies?</i>

Hey, can you check something
for me,

in the bathroom
next to my bedroom?

<i>All right, one sec.</i>

<i>- I'm here, what is it?</i>
Check in the cabinet behind the door,

there should be like a small
wicker basket thing there.

<i>Okay, there's pills in here.</i>

Are there any
birth control pills in there?

<i>Mmm, no, it's just Motrin IB
and some Advil.</i>

Okay. Thanks.

<i>Are you all right?</i>

Yeah.

I'm just tired.
You know, with everything.

<i>What is everything, Dom?</i>

<i>You know you can talk to me,
right?</i>

<i>Are you and Lisa okay?</i>

Okay, I'm just gonna
let you finish your movie.

Call you back in a few.

<i>Dom, wait.</i>

<i>Dom...</i>

She was supposed to go
off the pill this month...

after we sold the company.

We were gonna work less hours,
start a family.

Maybe she threw away the pills
since, you know, it was time.

Is that what you really believe?

Yes.

Yes, I wanna forget.

Lisa?

Lisa! Lisa!

Lisa. Lisa.

Lisa, Lisa.
Let her go.

I...

am... your...

Lisa now!

I can't, I don't wanna do this anymore.
Stop fighting me!

This is what you want.

No, I remember the coffee!

Even if I was at the end
of the room in a meeting

and we had the fight
the night before,

Lisa always gave me my coffee
first before anyone else.

And I've been treating her
like a coworker.

Lisa is cheating on you.

You saw the "looook"
she gave him.

No amount of coffee
is going to change that.

I don't care.

She still gave me my coffee
before him.

That means she still
chooses to put me first.

Jorge's, right, I have to
focus on the right details.

I have a choice.

I'm gonna start over and make
sure I'm going to put Lisa first,

no matter what.

Oh, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

How boring.

<i>Hey-lo, you know who this is!</i>

<i>Stay late...
Shit, I got it wrong.</i>

Charlie, it's Dom.

I change my mind. I don't want to
know anything you found out on the plane.

You hear me?
Don't call me back.

Just send my bill
to Jorge's office.

<i>You know what?</i>

<i>I'm ashamed to admit,
but I kind of like this movie.</i>

Hey, you can go ahead
and mail the papers now.

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Are you crying?</i>

No.

<i>You've reached Lisa,</i>

<i>leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

Hey, it's me.

I mailed the papers and, uh...

I just wanted to thank you
for doing this trip.

If it wasn't for the plane,
you know, I would.

I love you, Lisa.

I'm sorry I haven't
said this in a long time.

And I'm sorry I've been
taking you for granted.

But I want you to know
that I love you so much.

I wanna have a family
with you...

and let you tie me up
and do whatever you wanted

to do to me because I love you
so much.

And when you come back...

I'll make sure
you never forget it.

Well... well, that's all.

Bye.

Jorge! Jorge!
Hey, wake up!

Chinese food's here.

Call 911.

They're pretty sure he's just severely
dehydrated and just needs some fluids,

but they're gonna take him to
the emergency room just in case.

I called Claire and told her, she's
gonna head over to the hospital right now.

That's good.
Thanks for doing that.

Hey, if you can keep
all of this...

Don't even worry about it.

When that door closes...

Won't even ask how you got
those marks on your neck.

Jorge may have given me
some substances.

I know, that's why I don't ask.

Just make sure Jorge
takes it easy, okay?

I'm not planning on leaving
this office anytime soon.

Noted.

Let me run to the bathroom,
then I'll lock up?

<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

<i>Dom, I have some bad news.
The Rowley house burned down.</i>

<i>I'm headed out for the day,
just thought you should know.</i>

<i>- Bye.</i>
Aw, shit.

Hey, I think I'll have to skip out on
the drinks with your friend for tonight.

What? Don't say you have to go
home, the highways are still closed.

I checked.
No, I think I should go check on Jorge at the hospital.

He invited me to stay
over at his place tonight,

so this is the least I can do
as a friend.

Ugh, I guess that's
an acceptable excuse.

Well, let me give you my number.

Just in case.

Thanks.

Cheer up, Dom. There's
always a reason to smile.
