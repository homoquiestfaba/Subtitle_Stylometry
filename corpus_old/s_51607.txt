[Music playin]



Hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Aha.

Wowsers, it's quiet.

Too quiet.

And when it's this quiet...

you know what that means, Brain?


Evil's afoot.


We're on a stakeout,

Gadgetmobile!.

No, you're on a stakeout.
I'm on a sleep-in.

So keep it down, a'ight?

The least you could do
is stay alert.

Alert for what?
Face it. Inspector G...

since we locked up Claw,
all the bad guys have been...

too afraid to show
their faces in Riverton.

One thing I've learned
in all my years...

of crime fighting,
Gadgetmobile...

is that it's
always the most quiet...

right before
the criminals strike!.

And speaking of crime...



Potential law-breaker at 12:00!

Who, Grandma over there?

Go, go, Gadget radar gun.


No, no, no.

Go, go, Gadget radar gun.


Oops!
There go those glitches again.

No, radar gun! Radar gun!


The speed limit is clearly
posted at 25 miles per hour...

but she's going exactly
25.3 miles per hour.

Prepare for high-speed chase!


[Sirens wailing]


Hang onto your pockets,
'cause here come the rockets.



Stop in the name of the--

Law.

That went well.

Go, go, Gadget parachute!


GADGETMOBILE.. Whoa. Now.
how is that for disc brakes?

Go, go, Gadget parachute,
back in the thing.

Oh...

Ahem.

[Brakes squeak]

Ma'am, do you know
that drag racing...

on public roads is illegal?

But, officer, l--

GADGET: There are no buts
when it comes to the law.

I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license.

I'm sorry, officer.
I must've left it at home.

Yeah, a likely story.

Go, go, Gadget handcuffs.


Aah! You have the right
to remain...silent!

If you give up--
Coming through--

that right--Unh! [Boing]

My man really needs
to switch to decaf.

[Music playing]

[Gears whirring]






GADGETMOBILE..
OK. one sweet granny...

packaged
and ready for delivery.

GADGET.. Drag racing indeed.

I've seen your type before.

You've got a need for speed.

Yes--I know.

Hey, Uncle Gadget!
Hi, Brain.


I thought we agreed
you'd call me "lnspector"...

in front of
the hardened criminals.

She's a hardened criminal?

Don't be fooled
by appearances, Penny.

Look what I found in her purse.

Probably
from one of her victims.

And look at this.

Liquid evil.

But, officer--

Save it for the judge, perp.

Yeah, but, but, but.

Everybody's got a big but.

What are you doing here?
Isn't today a school day?

There aren't any good cases
to solve at school.

I want to solve
real cases with you.

Penny,
I told you before...

you're too young to be
chasing criminals.

You should be in school.

Uncle Gadget, if you'd
just give me a chance--

Look, I have to go.

I'm in the middle
of a big arrest.

Now you
get back to school...

and I'll see you tonight.

And you,
I hope you like prison food.

Mm, mm, mm.

BAXTER: Now. Iet's see
how your physiobiometric...

febble fitzer
is functioning.


Diagnostics check out fine.

What seems to be
the problem, Gadget?

Baxter. I'm still having
gadgets with my glitches.

I mean,

glitches with my gladgets.

I'm all messed up.

Sorry, Gadget, I don't
see what the problem is.

Watch.

Go, go, Gadget toothbrush.



GADGET: See? Bubble gum.

I see what the problem is.

Isn't there something
you can do for me, Baxter?

Well, you're the prototype
gadget, Gadget.

There's bound
to be a few glitches.

But you'll be happy to know
we've been working on it.

I'll let you in
on a little secret.

Soon, we'll be

unveiling something...

[Beeping, chatter]

soon--that'll solve all
these glitches for good--soon.

Wowsers. Thanks, Baxter.

Well, better go
check in with the chief.

I wouldn't bother
the chief right now.

I heard some idiot arrested
his mother this afternoon.

CHIEF: Where is he?!

Gadget!

BAXTER: Oh...

You put my mother in jail
for drag racing?

And driving without a license.

You've always said, Chief,
no one is above the law.

This is what you said last week
when you arrested...

that troop of Girl Rangers
for selling cookies!

[Flashbulbs popping]

Those cookies were three days
past expiration date!


CHIEF: What--Ugh.

You are this close to being
put on probation, Gadget.

Now, let's get my mother out.

Heaven knows
what's happening to her...

down there
with all those lowlifes.

When his guard is down,
his kidneys are exposed...

and that's when
the marathon of pain begins.

-Oh!
-Who's your grandma now?

Take some of this!
How'd you like this?

GADGET:
Wowsers, that's gotta hurt.


Unh!

Mom's tough love.

This is your last warning,
Gadget.

Stick to solving real crimes.

Chief, there are

no real criminals left.

They're all in Riverton Prison.


[Telephone rings]

[Ring ring]

Gadget here.

[lndistinct chatter]

What?

Uh-huh.

Wowsers!


You'll never guess
what happened.

Claw escaped!

Claw escaped?

Police have put out
an all-points bulletin...

and are setting up
a dragnet...

in hopes of finding
the fugitive.

Citizens are advised
that if they see...

an evil genius with a claw.
not to approach him.

Dial 91 1 immediately.

He's extremely dangerous
and really. really mean.

And I'm on the case.
Bye-bye, Penny!

PENNY: Wait, Uncle Gadget!

Let me come with you.
I can help look for clues--

I told you before, Penny,
you're too young.

How old do you have to be
to be a detective?

I don't know.

But older than you are now.

Look...

I've got work to do.
I'll see you tomorrow.

Don't forget
to brush your teeth.

[Kisses rapidly]

I could do so well...

if he would
just give me a chance.

[Whimpers, barks]

My finely honed instincts
are telling me...

that he probably escaped
through here.

Oh, really?

Gadget, take a look at this.

We found this in Claw's cell.

Wowsers. You don't think
he's still holding a grudge?

Gadget, listen.

The whole city
is counting on you.

Go out there and catch Claw.

Oh, I'll catch him.

Caught him before,
catch him again.

Don't you worry, Chief.

I'll have Claw back behind bars
before you can say--

CHIEF: Gadget--Ooh!

[Ominous music playing]

CLAW:
Brick. retrieve my darts!

Huh? Ooh!

McKible. serve my tea!


McKlBLE:
I don't see why we gotta...

retrieve your darts
and serve your tea.

Yeah!

We're vicious minions,

not valets.

Aah! Oh!

Heh heh heh.
One sugar or two?

Two.

Here, boss.

BRlCK: Dr. Claw,

this place is a dump.

What happened to
your multimillion-dollar...

high-rise evil headquarters?

What do you
think happened to it?

Aah!

CLAW:
When Gadget arrested me...

the police confiscated
all my assets.

But after we've pulled off
the crime of the century...

I'll be back on top again.

Great--another
crime of the century.

I'm still on parole
for the last one.

What's the plan this time?

Watch and see.

NEWS ANCHOR:
The Federal Reserve Bank...

with a deposit of over
five trillion dollars...

in pure gold.
was built two years ago...

after Riverton was
declared statistically...

the safest city in America.

Utilizing the latest
in security technology...

and a squadron
of armed guards...

the bank is considered
impregnable.

CLAW : Not for long.

BRlCK: We're gonna rob
the Federal Reserve!

CLAW:
Right before Riverton's eyes...

and there won't be a thing
Gadget can do about it.

How we gonna do that?
They said the bank was impen--


Really hard to get into.

Yeah, I don't see how.

That's why you're minions,
and I'm an evil genius.

-He's got a point.
-Yeah.

We are going to build
the ultimate super weapon.

But we haven't much time.

We need to be ready
in 10 days...

because next Thursday
at exactly 9: 23 A. M...

the X-Force One satellite
will be directly over Riverton.

And by then.
we need to steal...

ion fuel cells.
a protoid laser...

and a ruby...

plus a few miscellaneous
knickknacks.

BRlCK: Yum.
I love knickknacks.

[McKible groans]

[Reporters shouting questions]

Any news on Claw's escape?

The city's in a panic!

The people want to know.

What are you doing
to capture Claw?

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a momentous day.

[Glass breaks]

OFFlCER: Huh?

MAYOR: The Gadget pr.ogr.am
has helped make Riverton...

OFFlCER:
Thanks a lot. Hmph!

...the safest city in America!


Bob!

Thank you, Mayor.

We weren't going to unveil this
until next year...

but in light
of Claw's escape...

we decided to move up
our timetable.

[Dramatic music playing]

CHIEF: Baxter..

This is Gadget Model 2...

or "G2" for short.

The latest.
most newest gener.ation...

in the Gadget program.


[Crowd gasps]



[Techno music playing]

G2 reporting for duty.

Sir!


Wowsers.

BAXTER: She's similar
to the original Gadget...

but she's completely,
entirely all robot.

[Dreamlike music playing]

Not to worry, G2...

I've got everything
under control.

Oh, lnspector,
you're everything...

I ever wanted
in a crime-fighter.

[Prisoners groan]

Mmm.

[Romantic music playing]


CHlEF: Gadget. Gadget!

[Music stops]

Gadget, could you give me
a hand, please?

Certainly, Chief.

I want to give a little
demonstration of what G2 can do.

Pleasure to meet you,
Miss...2.

[Electricity crackles]

G2: Hmm.

Must be a loose wire
or something.

I'll speak to Baxter about that.

G2 will now show us how
she would apprehend the suspect.

Gadget, I want you
to take this stolen money...

and hide it on your person.

Stolen money!

Stop this felonious
and unlawful act...

or I shall have to use force.

Well, she has got
a very commanding voice.



COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert. suspect. suspect.

Very well. You were warned.



Whoa! OK! Whoa!

Oh!

Unh! Huh.

You have the right
to remain silent.

If you give up this right,
anything you say...

can and will be held
against you.

All right, G2,
I think we get the picture.

MAYOR: Bravo! Bravo!

Thank you.
Iadies and gentlemen--

GADGET: She is very good.

I noticed that she didn't
say "Go, go, Gadget."

That's one of the many
improvements I've made to G2.0.

Like it?

You might say that G2 is you
without the glitches.

I'm putting her
on the Claw case right away.

Fantastic.
I always wanted a partner.

And when we
interrogate criminals...

I'll play good Gadget,
and you can play bad Gadget.

I don't think so.

OK, then you play good Gadget,
and I'll be bad Gadget.

I appreciate the offer,
lnspector...

but I work alone.

But, Chief,

the Claw case is my case.

You can go back to cracking
speeders on the highway.

There's a new sheriff in town.

Hmm?

PENNY: Uncle Gadget?
Is this tr.ue?

PENNY: Uncle Gadget?
Is this tr.ue?

They're giving the Claw case
to this G2 character?

For the time being,
but don't worry, Penny...

I'm being reassigned to
another high-profile case.

What could be more
high-profile than Claw?

It's top secret, Penny.

So top secret that
they haven't even told me yet.

PENNY: Hmm.

So, what are you making?

I'm just making
your favorite dessert.

Apple crumb cake
with raisin cinnamon icing...

and coconut sprinkles?

OK, I'm making your
second favorite dessert...

Iemon pudding.

So, since

you're off the case...

you wouldn't want to see
this clue I found about Claw.

Clue claw?
I mean, a Claw clue?

Is it a clue about Claw?

Take a look
at today's classifieds.

"Wanted"...

"Apply 7 P ;M. tonight.

"Call 555-01 39
for appointment."

I've already got a job,
Penny, but thanks.

No, I checked the number...

and it's for a bar called
"The Blue Monkey."

You know what this means?

Hmm.

Uncle Gadget,
if you go to The Blue Monkey...

I bet it will
lead you right to Claw.

You can get back on the case
and get a jump on G2.

You know, Penny,
if I went to The Blue Monkey...

it might just lead me to Claw.

Then I could get back on
the case and get the jump on G2.

That's what I was just saying.

Did you? I guess
great minds think alike.

So, we'll leave

right after dinner?

No. Nope.
I'm sorry, Penny...

but this is official
police business only.

You gotta let me come with you.
I can help you.

Penny,
this is no place for a kid.

I'm not just a kid,
Uncle Gadget.

Of course not.
You're a very special kid.

But there's more to being
a detective than being smart.

It takes a sharp eye...

for every detail,
every little nuance.

A good detective never
lets anything get--

Uncle Gadget, the pudding!

Ooh! [Squirting]

Go. go. Gadget. stop beater.!

OK! Heh heh heh.

Everything's fine!

[Mixer stops]

[Gadget sighs]

Ugh.

It's a good thing
I wore an apron.

[Music playing]

GADGETMOBILE:
OK. her.e we ar.e.

GADGET: Wish me luck.
I'm going under.cover..

[People chattering]


Hi, there, fellas.

Unh.

PENNY: OK. Br.ain.
the coast is clear..

Come on,

let's check around back.

[Brain grumbles]



What do you want?

Well, I just got
out of the slammer...

and I'm looking
to wet my whistle.

What'll you have?

A nice tall glass of milk.

Milk?

I mean, chocolate milk.

Make it a double.

PENNY:
Hey. Br.ain. This way.

[Brain whimpers]

McKIBLE: OK. then.

Let's see what applicants
we have here.

Squint. Jungle Bob.

And you must be the one
they call "The Ninja. "

BRICK: "Ninja"?
Why do they call you that?

Hyah!

[Fly groans]

I think I see why now.

OK, then.

Judging by this, you guys
are prime minion material.


Hoo!

I have a history of
hair loss in my family.

Anything else I can get you?

Yes.

I'm looking for...

Sorry, we don't serve
lobster here.

What? No.

Dr. Claw.

Claw, huh?

If you want to find him...

you're gonna have
to grease a few palms...

if you get my drift.

Well, whatever you say.

Here you go--

top grade axle grease.


Why, you...

Go, go, Gadget duck.

Aah!

Whoa!


[Birds tweeting]


Check, please.

Just the check.


[Beep beep beep]

So...

When do we start working
for Dr. Claw?

McKIBLE: Immediately.

Did you hear that, Brain?

[Brain growls]


GADGET: Aah! Come on, guys,
let's talk about it.

Oh, man. Aah!

You're stretching my sweater.

Help, Gadgetmobile!

Help! Oof!


[Crashing inside]


The cops!
Come on, this way!

Let's get out of here quick!
Move it, move it!

[Men yelling]

BRICK:
We can hide at my mom's house.

PENNY: That was close.


GADGET:
Ooh, I can see you're upset.

BARTENDER: Hey, look,
I'm knocking his block off!

Mommy...

Coo-coo. Coo-coo.

Coo-coo.

Stop this felonious
and unlawful act...

or I shall have to use force.

Look, boys, Malibu Barbie
is gonna get rough with us.

[Men laughing]

G2: Very well.
You were warned.


Wowsers, she's good.




[Tap tap]

GADGETMOBlLE: Lucky for them
I wasn't in there.

I would have been on them
like ugly on a mini-van.

GADGET:
Thanks for the backup, G2...

although everything
was under control.

I had those toughs
right where I wanted them.

Inspector, what were you doing
in that bar dressed as...

What exactly are you dressed as?

I'm a hooligan. Huh?

I went undercover to follow up
on a valuable lead...

concerning Where's clawabouts--

I mean, Claw's whereabouts.

I'm in charge of the Claw
investigation, remember?

GADGET: Maybe we got off
on the wrong foot. Ooh!

Oh.

Perhaps we could have
dinner sometime--

just to discuss
crime-fighting strategies.

Imagine how great
we could be as a team.

We could call ourselves
"The G-Force"...

or "The G-Team" or "The 2 Gs".

-lnspector Gadget.
-What up, G?

Even though I'm not programmed
for such emotions...

I admit I find you
strangely...Iikable.

Hmm.

But as I already told you,
I work alone.

And so do l.

I'm just saying that maybe
we could work alone together.

PENNY:
You don't even know who I am.

Think about it.

No, really.
You can't arrest me.

I'm one of the good guys.
Really, I am.

Hold on. She's with me.

What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

Never mind that.
Look what I found about Claw.

McKlBLE: Dr. Claw's pulling
a little heist tomorrow night...

at the Concentrated
lndustries warehouse.

Wowsers!
We'll have to have a stakeout.

You mean,

I'll have to have a stakeout.

This is our case, lady.

Penny.

I know.
You told me to stay out of it...

but I did find you this clue.

Penny, I know you want
to be a detective.

But this following me
around all the time...

just isn't going to fly.

Oh!

Uh...

Gadgets!

Hi, Chief.

Gadget, what are you doing
in a barroom brawl?

Looking for Clue claws.

Claw clues--
clue about Claw.

And I was right.
We got a valuable lead.

Yeah, a very valuable lead.

We have evidence
of a possible heist...

at Concentrated lndustries
warehouse tomorrow night.

Great work, G2!

Stake it out
and catch him red-handed.

GADGET: Fantastic.
I'll bring the doughnuts.

I already told you.
You're off this case.

Both you and Nancy Drew here.

Hey! Pbbt!

And you're off the force,
too, if you get within...

as a hundred yards
of that stakeout.

Fine, but if Claw gets away
with his plan...

for world domination,

don't come crying to us.

Remember, Gadget--100 yards!

GADGET: 99, 100...

101 yards away.

I'm at the stakeout...

but I haven't violated
the chief's orders.

See? At the stakeout...

not at the stakeout.

Stakeout...
not at the stakeout.

I don't think the chief
will see it that way.

Go, go, Gadget binoculars.



She certainly is well-equipped,
isn't she?

GADGETMOBlLE:
Ooh, Gadget's got a girlfriend.

Don't be silly, Gadgetmobile.

Our relationship
is strictly professional.


Besides, she's state-of-the-art.

I'm last year's model.

A few extr.a miles
look good on a player....

and you are a player, G.

You're tricked out with
more extras than the Batmobile.

Just show her that
it's all good under the hood.

I have no idea
what you just said...

but I'm sure
that if I were a car...

it would have been very helpful.

All I'm saying is,
you got to show her...

you got what it takes, man.

You're right.
You're right!

Thanks, Gadgetmobile.

I'm just gonna go up
to the roof...

and scope out the situation.

GADGETMOBlLE: You go ahead
on with your bad self--Ha!

I don't know what that man
would do without me.

GUARD: Hold on, there.

What do you want?

We got a delivery.

This ain't no food warehouse.
I need some authorization.



Will that do?

[McKible and Brick laugh]

We're in, Your Clawfulness.

CLAW: Good. Now bring me
the ion fuel cells.

Yes, sir.

Halt!

SQUlNT: Oh!
It's the mechanical meter maid!

I'm real scared!

Ha ha ha! Good one, Squint.

Uh-oh. Looks like G2
could use some backup.

Stop this felonious
and unlawful act...

or I shall have to use force.

No problem, love. Catch!


Huh?


Ooh--Aah!

Ooh! She got the kung fu.

Aah!

Oh--Aah!

I'm gonna give them
a little bit of the what for!

Go, go,
Gadget helicopter hat.

[Bell ringing]

Stupid glitches!

JUNGLE BOB: Come on!
Come on, you! Rrr!


Whoa! Ohh.

Hyah!

Whoa!

Aah!

[Gong rings]

Wowsers, she sure is limber.

-Huh?
-Huh?

-What is that?
-I don't know.

Oh, I don't like this.


-Oh, no!

-Unh!

[Beep beep]

McKIBLE:
Hur.r.y it up. bonehead!

Go, go, Gadget something
to get me down there.


[Whoosh, flutter]

Wowsers. I never knew
I had one of these.

G2: Stop this felonious
and unlawful act...

or I shall have to use force.

Oh--Aah!

You imbecile!

COMPUTER VOICE:
Suspect. suspect.

G2: Very well.
You were warned.

Gadget to the rescue!

Ooh--Unh!

No! No!


What are you doing here?

Well, it looked like

you could use some help.

Quick, grab the fuel cells!

Let's get out of here!

G2: They're getting away.

Not to worry, G2.
I'll get us out of this.

Go, go, Gadget scissors.


CHIEF: Gadget!

I told you specifically
not to go to the stakeout.

I told you specifically
not to go to the stakeout.

That's not
entirely accurate, Chief.

You told me not to get within
100 yards of the stakeout...

and I posted myself
exactly 101 yards away.

Then how did you get tangled up
with me inside the warehouse?

You gave me backup at the bar..

I thought I'd give you
backup at the warehouse.

I never need backup.

Until we find out what Claw
needs the fuel cells for...

all of Riverton is at risk.

Chief, you have to put me
back on the case.

The department needs me!


That's right, Gadget.

The department does need you.

And I've got
just the assignment...

to take advantage of
your unique abilities.


Go, go, Gadget power brush.


[Brush stops]

[Brush starts and stops]

Come on, come on.

I'm stuck.

Go, go, Gadget turbo speed.

Aah!

Go, go, Gadget stop!

Stop!

Aah!


Ah--ah--oh--oh--oh--ow.

Be careful in there.

That toilet's got quite a flush.

[Claw laughing]

Looks like Gadget has finally
found his true calling--

Roto-rooter man. Ha ha ha!

Hey, Dr. Claw, check this out--

an unlimited supply
of bowling shirts.

And shoes!


[Minions scream]

CLAW: Silence!

Everyone, pay attention!

Who can tell me
what we need next...

to build my super weapon?

Uh...

CLAW: The laser.!

A new exper.imental
pr.otoid laser....

that's being unveiled at the
Riverton science convention.

But to take it,

we need a little diversion.


Hey, Uncle Gadget.

Penny,
shouldn't you be in school?

Uncle Gadget,
school was over an hour ago.

Oh. I'm sorry, Penny.

Oh. hey!

This came for you
in the mail today.

Looks kind of strange.

"lnspector Gadget..."

Wowsers! He must have
really bad handwriting...

to go to all that trouble.

Or maybe he doesn't want you
to identify his handwriting.

Look, it's signed
"Anonymous concerned citizen."

It's good to know we still have
a concerned citizen...

who's willing to get involved.

This smells like Claw.


No.
Why would Claw want me there?

I don't know.

Uncle Gadget,
this might be a trap.

Penny, I'm thinking
that this might be a trap.

That's what I just said.

You gotta let me
come with you this time.

Sorry, Penny. No can do.

This is work for a serious
law enforcement professional.

You mean like
a bathroom attendant?

Exactly.

Don't stay up for me, Penny.

I'm on the case.

[Tires screech]

I need you to keep
a sharp eye out, Gadgetmobile.

If you see anything suspicious,
you let me know.

GADGETMOBlLE: Like a Trekkie
with a girlfriend?

GADGET: Exactly.

CLAW: The goose has arrived--
ready to be cooked.



MAN: Ther.e we go.
How's that?

Yeah. now. I'll just...

Even at this level?
Wow!

[Machine whirring]

Round and round.

RADIO : In sports.
the National Hockey League...

GADGET: Hmm...

Keep your eyes peeled
for anything suspicious, Brain.

Come on.

BAXTER: Inspector. Gadget!

Hey, Baxter!
What are you doing here?

I'm showing off
my latest gizmo...

the bark translator.

It's going to give
a whole new meaning...

to the term "police dog."

Watch.

Speak, Pedro.


[Cow moos]

Very impressive.
Now Pedro can talk to cows.

No, no. It's supposed
to translate into English...

once I've got all the bugs out.

[Elephant trumpets,
sheep bleats]

[Rooster crows]

MAN: Attention. the unveiling
of the new pr.otoid laser....

is about to begin.

I'll see you around, Baxter.

Bye bye, Pedro. Good luck!

Pedro.

[Yodels, roars]

Better have myself
a little look around.

Go, go, Gadget binoculars.



Inspector Gadget!

Inspector Gadget!

Excuse me, lnspector.
I'm your biggest fan.

BRICK: I thought
I was his biggest fan.

No. I'm definitely
his biggest fan.

No. I'm his biggest fan.

Will you excuse me
for one minute?

[Screams gibberish]

Sorry.

Would you mind
if we took a picture?

Uh, no. I'm always happy
to oblige my fans.

Ready?

Say cheese.

-Cheese.
-Cheese.

Heh heh heh.
Thank you, lnspector.

You'll never know how much
that means to me.

Well, it's my pleasure.

And remember, crime doesn't pay.

CLAW: Wrong, Gadget.

Crime always pays.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

Thank you, thank you.

Distinguished guests...

and, of course,

members of the media...

it is my great pleasure
to welcome you...

to my--whoops--
our science convention.

The chip is in position,
Your Clawfulness.

Watch as
I play with my new toy...

the Gadget puppet.

Guess that letter
must've been a prank.

Everything seems OK.

Oh.

I've never had glitches
like that before.

MAYOR: And to introduce
you to the eminent...

Nobel-prize winning scientist,
Dr. Theodore von Sprokenwich.

Thank you ver.y much.

Thank you. thank you.

It's so nice to be her.e
in Riverton.

Ah--ah--ah.

...his new experimental
protoid laser.


Think positive, no-glitch...

thoughts.

All right, Gadget, let's party!

Ha ha.


Whoa--whoa--whoa.


I'm sorry! Should come out
with a little soda water.

Inspector Gadget,
what do you think you're doing?

Aah! I didn't say
"Go, go, Gadget" anything.

Huh--unh--oh.

Oh, no, Uncle Gadget, what now?

Oh--Whoa--Whoa!

What's wrong, lnspector?

I think
I'm having a glitch attack.

Ha ha ha!

Hyah!

Sor.r.y!

Unh! Hyah! Excuse me.

Whoa--Mickey.

Woof! Woof! "Woof"?

Let's go!

Gadgetmobile, help!


[Gadget yelling]

I was right!

Claw's men
are stealing the laser!

[Machine powers down]

Don't let them get away.
Hurry!



We got away with it.


BRICK: You know what.
this thing's heavy.


Hey! Aah!
These are my favorite shoes!

Get in the car!


[Gadget shouting]

Gadget, I said
stop it this instant!

I've got everything
under control.

Ooh!


Oh!

GADGET:
Relax. Mayor. Wilson!

It's only toothpaste.

Remember, kids,

brush twice a day.

Aah!

Aah--Aah!


-Aah!
-Aah!

Whoa!

Ooh.

Easy.

Ew.

Not to worry. I'm all right.

You!


Oof! He's got my shoe!

Bad doggy! Let's go.

[Tires screech]


First ion fuel cells
and now a protoid laser?

What is Claw up to?

GADGETMOBlLE: Huh?
What'd I miss this time?

PENNY:
Thanks for all your help.

GADGETMOBlLE:
I've been working nights, OK?

I need to recharge my battery.

[Brain barks]

Brain?
What you got there, boy?

From the bad guys?


Hey, now this might be
an important clue.



I hope Uncle Gadget's
not in too much trouble.

Fired? You can't fire me.

Fired? You can't fire me.

-I quit!
-Hmm.

Wait a second.
I don't want to quit.

Besides, Chief,

it's not my fault.

Look what Baxter
found on me--

a circuit override chip.

I don't care!
Claw stole the laser...

and you tarred and feathered
the mayor in toothpaste...

and caused
$100,000 in damages.

Turn in your badge, Gadget.

Oh, but, Chief...

all I ever wanted
to be my entire life...

was a crime fighter.

Your badge.

[Dramatic music playing]

That'll be all..;Mr. Gadget.


CLAW: Gadget's goose
is cooked--

mor.e like deep-fr.ied
and bur.nt to a cr.isp.

Ha ha ha!

Silence!

Now, with Gadget
out of the way...

it should be smooth
sailing from here on.

Ha ha ha!

GADGET: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Hmm.

[Machine grinding]

Uncle Gadget?

What are you
still doing in bed?

Why is your trench coat and hat
in the trash can?

I'm no longer a policeman,
Penny.


I'm a--Well...

There are a lot of things
that I could be.

Window washer, huh?

Dog catcher--
Ooh, parking valet.

Sky's the limit.

But, Uncle Gadget,
you can't give up now.

Look what we've got.

It's a bowling shoe.

One of Claw's men dropped it
at the science convention.

What were you doing at
the science convention?

Never mind that.
We can solve this together.

We can track down Claw
and get you your job back.

No. I'm through.

All right,
I'll track down Claw myself.

No. No, no, no...

no, no, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no.

You are to stay out
of this completely.

This is a grown-up problem.

Uncle Gadget,
just give me a chance.

One chance.

The fact is,

there's nothing...

that you or anyone else
can do for me.

I'll never be a crime fighter.

Never again.

PENNY:
You don't believe in me.



Go away, Brain.

Brain, go away.



OK, I get the message.

It's up to us now, Brain.

We have to help Uncle Gadget.


Come on, let's get to work.

[Music playing]




Go, go, Gadget hammer.



That's lunch, people.


[Scissors snipping,
hair dryer blowing]

[Saw cuts, blowtorch blasts]

All finished. Voila.

[Hair sizzling]

WOMAN: Aah!

What's this?

A patent number.

Aha.

CLAW:
Faster.. minions. faster..

Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!



G2, are you any closer
to capturing Claw?

Yes. I'm on the case.

Hmm.



Keep your. paws cr.ossed. Br.ain.

This might be exactly
what we're looking for.

[Bowling ball strikes pins]

Look. It's the same shoe.

The shoe was made
by the Bowl-Rite Company...

in the 1950s and 1960s.

I wonder. wher.e
their. factor.y was.

Let's see. 1 959. Bingo.

Ah, here it is.

The Bowl-Rite
Bowling Equipment Company...

down on Old Mill Road.

It must've gone
out of business...

because it's not in any of
the directories after 1960.

I wonder
what's there now, Brain.

CLAW: Now. the thir.d item
that I need--Huh?

"I'm so evil.
Blah blah blah"?

Argh!

[Man laughs]

As I was saying...

the third item to complete
my super weapon.


I know this one--the ruby.

Yes, but a big ruby--

say, about 50,000 karats.
Heh heh heh!

Your Clawsomeness...

where are we going to find
a rock that big?

The Riverton Museum.

The ruby's on loan
from the Raja of lndia...

and will be on display
Wednesday night...

at the mayor's fund-raiser.

We are going to stop by...

and do a little fund-raising
of our own.



GADGET: Good evening.
Iadies and gentlemen...

and welcome to Mayor. Wilson's
Fund-r.aiser.-o-r.ama.

MAYOR: Oh.

CHlEF: Ow! Ohh.

Gadget.

Don't worry, Chief.
No need to tip me.

We better be getting inside.

Yeah. It's nice in there.

MAYOR: I'm her.e.

Good evening.
Good evening. ever.yone.

Yes. it's me. Ha!

Br.eak out the camer.as.

[Sitar music playing]

Ooh, another photo-op.

[Quimby humming]

G2, notice anything suspicious
about those musicians?

Aside from the fact
the music doesn't match...

the instruments they're playing?

Come on, Brain.

Yep. This is definitely
the place.

At least
the building's still here.

[Wood clatters]

[Wind blowing]

[Brain whimpers]

I don't know, Brain.

This place is creepy.

[Brain whimpers]

Welcome, sir, welcome.

Lady Campbell,
how wonderful you could come.

Lovely to see you, sir.

Oh! Claw!

Aah!


CLAW: Gr.eetings. Mayor..

Hope you don't mind if we dr.op
in on your. Iittle party.

Everybody stop
right where you are.

The festivities
have just begun...

and I can promise
it's going to be a gas--

Laughing gas, that is.

Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Ho ho ho ho!

That's right.
Laugh it up, Riverton...

because I am having
the last laugh now.


Rah ha ha ha ha ha!

[People laughing]

Must be quite a party.

Do something to stop him,
Chief Quimby.

[Both laugh]

You'll never get away with this.

We'll see.

Ha ha ha ha! G2, see.

Very funny, Claw,
but you forget--

I am unaffected
by laughing gas.

Now stop this felonious
and unlawful act...

or I shall have to use force.

Ah, the lady Gadget.

I've so looked forward
to meeting you.

I hope you don't fall victim...

to my magnetic charm.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha!


Ha ha ha oh!

[Metal clanking]


Hee hee hee! Aah!

[Metal pinging]

Oh! Oh!

Mmm! Unh!




Now if you'll excuse me, G2...

I have some shoplifting to do.

Ha ha ha!

[Glass shatters]


It looks like
someone's been here--

and recently, too.

Aah!


Thanks, Brain.


Do you see that?

Brain, look.

It's a perfect match.

[Band laughing]

GADGET: Done so soon?

McKlBLE: Yeah. We were playing
the "Unfinished Symphony."

BRlCK: Yeah. And then
we took this giant ruby.

Yeah. That was the name
of our last song.

You know,

"We Took This Giant Ruby."

" We took this giant r.uby "

" Took this giant r.uby "

" Stole this giant r.uby "

" Stole this giant r.uby "

Just a minute, there.

Huh?


Let me get that for you.

CLAW: Thank you, lnspector.

GADGET:
That's it. Everybody in.

Thank you.

Nice to carpool, isn't it?

Yeah. There.

[Tires squeal]

No tip.
They stiffed me again.

I live on tips!

Brain, take a look at this.

"Fuel cells."

That's what Claw
stole from the warehouse.

"Laser." That's what Claw took
from the science convention.

"Ruby."


What would
Claw want with a ruby?

[Reads title aloud]

Claw's definitely
up to something big.

Wait a minute.
I know what Claw's up to.

He's going to build--

[Door opens]

Come on, Brain.

[Men laughing]

We're rich! Hey, hey!

How much do you think
this thing would fetch on Ebay?

About $1.98.

CLAW: No, nitwits.

Once we've robbed
the Federal Reserve...

we can buy hundr.eds
of these baubles.

With my secret weapon,
Riverton will be defenseless--

as will the rest of the world!

[All laughing]

I've got to tell Uncle Gadget.

Come on.

[Metal clanks, laughter stops]


[Balls clatter]

Well, if it isn't mini-Gadget.
Get her!

JUNGLE BOB:
Come on. Iet's go!

SQUINT: This way! Come on!

-Whoa!
-Ahh!

McKIBLE:
She's getting away!

I'll cut her off at the pass.

-Come here.
-Aah!

Gotcha!

Whoa! Ohh!

Uhh...

-Aah!
-Get back here.

Get her!

Aah! [Gasps]

[Men snicker]

Hey, isn't this the place
to get new bowling shoes?

MEN: No! Uh-uh.


I assure you, Ms. Mayor.

We'll do everything in our power
to apprehend Claw.

G2 will be--

G2 is finished...

along with
the whole Gadget program.

It's time we reinvested...

in some good old-fashioned
policemen and women...

not these mechanical clowns.

Ms. Mayor, if you just
give me another chance--

You had your chance.

It's bad enough
they stole the ruby...

but what's worse...

no one gave any money
to my campaign.


I should've learned
my lesson with Gadget.

This whole program
is a total waste of time.

Come on, G2.

We're taking you to the precinct
for immediate deactivation.

Deactivation?

That's right. Deactivation.

[Dramatic music playing]

Hmm.

GADGET: I'm sor.r.y. G2.


Thank you...

but there's nothing you can do.


Now, G2.

[Car engine starts]

Nothing I can do.

Hmm.


[Liquid bubbling]

OK.

Where's that light switch?

Aah!

Aah! Aah! Ow!

Ohh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!



Ahh.

[Dramatic music playing]

[Machinery whirring]



What happened?

I reactivated you.

Inspector Gadget,
why would you do that?

I hate to see a good detective
get recycled...

and I've always had
great admiration...

for your investigative abilities
and physical prowess...

your commanding voice.

Inspector,
are you saying you like me?

Well, I suppose.
In a manner of speaking.


Strictly professional.

Huh?

[Heartbeat stops]

Mm-mmm. Ha ha ha.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

[Brain barking]


Brain,

what are you doing here?

Where's Penny?


He's trying
to tell me something.

It's too bad I don't speak dog.

If only dogs
could talk like people.

That would be good--

Wait a second.
I have an idea.


All right, Brain. Now speak.

[Static, rooster crows]

[Dolphin chirps]

[Elephant trumpets]

[Tarzan yell]

[Frog croaks]

Heh heh.

[Man speaking French]

Bowwow.

Brain...
speak something else.

BRAlN: Check.
Testing 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

Penny has been kidnapped
by Claw.

Amazing, isn't it,
what modern technology can do.

Wowsers!
Penny's been kidnapped by Claw?

Yeah, and Claw's built

some sort of giant laser...

he's going to fire at Riverton
and rob the Federal Reserve.

He's holding Penny captive
at the old Bowl-Rite factory...

on the outskirts of town.

The bowling factory?

Of course.
The bowling shoe.

Penny was right.

I should've listened to her.

She tried to tell me,

and I didn't listen to her.

BRAlN:
Speaking of listening...

I'm getting a little tired
of liver-flavored kibble.

Would it kill you to shell out
for a pork roast or prime rib?

Look, G2,

my niece is in trouble.

I know that you don't ever
work with a partner...

but I really need your help.

Are you sure you want my help?

I can't think of a better person
to go after a supervillain with.

[Brain barks]

All right, let's do it!

Let's kick some Claw tail.

[Upbeat music playing]

[Upbeat music playing]


[Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh]


[Whirs, clicks]

[Bell rings]

-Ready?
-Ready.

Let's go.


McKIBLE:
We'r.e her.e. Your. Clawsomeness.

PENNY: Claw. you'll never.
get away with this.

My dear, prepare to witness
a great historical moment.

Your demise?

Ha ha ha!
I do enjoy your sense of humor.

Now. it's almost 9: 23.

McKible, activate the ray.

[Car alarm chirp]

Why can't evil geniuses
ever say "please"?

He's a very busy man.

I'm a busy man, too.

[Tone buzzes]

-Whoa.
-Behold!

The greatest super weapon
of the 21st Century.

A bowling pin?

CLAW:
No. you dim-witted pea-br.ain.

Watch and see.



Whoa.

Double whoa.

Meet the time displacement
laser--

my crowning achievement
in a lifetime of evil.

Riverton doesn't stand a chance.

Hurry, Gadgetmobile, before
they fire the giant laser.

Can't you make this jalopy
go any faster?

Jalopy? Oh, yeah?

Well, bring on the noise
and bring on the funk...

because I'm bringing out
what's in my trunk.


[Flesh flapping]

[Pops, whimpers]

And just wait until
I get into second gear.

CLAW: Time for. Riverton
to take a little snooze.

Ha ha!


Fir.e away!

Ah ha ha!




[Screaming stops]





REPORTER:
Over. her.e. Mayor. Wilson.

Whoo ooh!

It's gaining on us.

Faster, faster.

[Birds chirp]

GADGET:
Wowser.s! That was close.

Riverton is in a deep freeze,
Your Clawcity.

That means time has stopped.

That's what I said.

CLAW: Good. Now we won't have
any trouble with traffic.

Ha ha ha ha!

BRICK: I don't get it.

Uncle Gadget.

[Tires squeal]

Looks like it's stopped.
Think it's safe to go back?

There's no time to waste.

We got to stop Claw
and rescue Penny.

Then to the Federal Reserve--
and step on it.

It's time to kick
some bad guy booty.

[Tires squeal]

CLAW: We'r.e just her.e
to pick up...

a few hundred billion
in bullion.

Hope you don't mind.

I don't think
he minds...a bit.

[Brick laughs]


Time to show me the money.

[Both laugh]

[Motor whirs]

[Whirring stops]

[Dramatic music playing]

It'll take weeks
to crack this thing.

Not if you know
the right people.

Thank you. Mr.. Bank Dir.ector..

Your. services
ar.e no longer. r.equir.ed.



[All laughing]

McKIBLE: We'r.e r.ich! Rich!

CLA W: OK. under.Iings...

Iooks like the Feder.al Reserve
is having a 1 00% off sale!

Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

GADGETMOBILE:
Out of my way.

G Team coming thr.ough.

I'm going to need
a really big piggy bank.

McKlBLE: Come on, Brick.

Faster, faster.

CLAW: Now, let's see.

Tomorrow, we rob Fort Knox.

Then on Tuesday, the Louvre.

So much to steal,

so little time.

Wait. I've got
all the time in the world.

[Men laugh]

[Tires squeal]

GADGETMOBILE:
The cavalr.y has ar.r.ived.

Huh? Gadget again.

Uncle Gadget,
you're all right!

-Aah!
-Come here, you.

Oh!

GADGET: The jig is up. Claw.

You're under arrest
for kidnapping...

bank robbery,
breaking out of prison...

and general all-around evil.

The jig is
most certainly not up.

In fact,

the jig is just starting.

You want me to play dentist
with your niece?

PENNY: Uncle Gadget. help!

Brick! McKible!

PENNY: Help!

-Get in there, you.
-Aah!

-Dr. Claw, what about us?

-Yeah, man.

You're minions, aren't you?
Get the good guys!

PENNY: Uncle Gadget. help!

Help! Help me!

I'll take care of these clowns.

You go after Claw.

Good call, G2.

Go, go, Gadget helicopter hat.


Stupid glitches.

being last year's model.

Let me give you something
from this year's model.

Take one of my chips.

G2, but...then you might
get the glitches.

I'll manage.




OK. Better stand back.

Go, go, Gadget helicopter hat.


Whoa. It works.

It works! It works!

[Dramatic music playing]

GADGETMOBILE:
You go get 'em. G.

Whoa!

This shouldn't take long.

GADGETMOBILE: Time to
take out the tr.ash. G-gir.I...

and don't bother. to r.ecycle.

[Engine whirring]

[Tires squeal]

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!



Dr. Claw, it's Gadget.

CLAW: Uhh. Not again.

Oh, Uncle Gadget.

Don't worry.

Time for Gadget
to go out with a bang.

[Beep, click]

Help!



Sorry.

-Oh, no!

-Heh heh heh.

Ooh!

He's still after us.

CLAW: McKible. Iose him!

[Tires squeal]

Hyah!

Grr.


Go, go, Gadget boomerang gun.


Huh?

[Pop, clang]



Ouch. [Thud]

Oh, well.

I guess when you have lemons,
make lemonade.

CLAW:
Care for a smoke, Gadget?



Aah!

Ow--ow--ow--ow!

Aah!


Ow--ow--ow--Unh!

Puhh!

PENNY: Uncle Gadget! Help!

Go, go, Gadget scooter.


[Horn honks, bell rings]

[Minions yelling]

Go, go, Gadget net guns.


BOTH: Whoa!

Oh. Huh?

What is this? I can't move!

I guess glitches sometimes
do have their benefits.

-Let me out! Hey!
-Get me out of here!

Looks like this case
is about wrapped up.

Hey, I just made a joke.

[Scooter rewing]

Unh! Hey, hey, hey!

Huh! Huh! Huh!

Gangway!

Whoop--Look out!

Police emergency.
Coming through.

[lmitating police siren]

Go, go, turbo speed.


Whoop--Excuse me.

Gadgetmobile, we have
to find lnspector Gadget.

No problem.
Gadget homing device activated.


Coming to get you, Claw.

Go, go, Gadget eject.




Huh! He's on the roof!

The roof?

Uncle Gadget, help!

McKible, get him off!

Take some of that, Gadget!

Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa!


GADGET: Help!

Time to switch to Plan "B"!

Go, go, Gadget can opener.

Ha ha.

[Can opener whirring]

Claw, stop the truck and
come out with your claw up!

You know, Gadget,
there's one true detective...

in your family,
and it isn't you.

Too bad you didn't listen to her
when you had the chance.

Penny? Penny?

Now it's time to say good-bye
to me and to your partner!


[Claw laughing]

PENNY: Aah!

Aah! Aah!


Uncle Gadget, help!

She has 60 seconds!
Ha ha ha ha!


PENNY: Help me!

Don't worry, Penny!
I'm coming!



Uh...

Who put that there?

PENNY: Uncle Gadget. help!

Penny?

Aah!

Uncle Gadget!

Penny, are you OK?

Claw's getting away.

That's not important right now.

Penny, you are the only thing
that matters to me.

[Timer beeping]

Uncle Gadget, the bomb--

It's gonna explode! Hurry!

Go, go, Gadget bolt cutter.



Hurry!

[Beep beep]

Got it! Let's go!



Whoa!


Oh, no.

CLAW: Ha ha ha ha!

I always like my Gadget
well done.

I got here too late.

GADGETMOBILE:
They'r.e gone for.ever..

It's the closest I've ever come
to being a family car.

Why?

[Penny coughing]


Uncle Gadget?

Uncle Gadget?

[Whistle, thud]

Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.


Not to worry.
I only landed on my head.

-They're alive!
-They're alive!

They're alive!

-Uncle Gadget!
-Oh!

You saved my life.

I was so worried about you.

G2: Good wor.k. Penny.

Thanks, G2.

[Brain barks]

Brain!

Glad to see you still
fully functioning, Gadget.

Well, thank you, G2.

Oh.

No time to celebrate now.

We have to catch Claw.

Let's go.

Ooh. Ow.

I'll go this way.

GADGETMOBILE: Hang on.
I know a shortcut.

GADGETMOBILE: Hang on.
I know a shortcut.

[Tires squeal]

[Dramatic music playing]

[Tires squealing]

Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

What? Gadget again?

There's only one way
to deal with a pest.

McKible, run him over.

One order of road kill
coming right up.

[Engine rewing]

[Claw laughs]

Go, go, Gadget bubble gum.

Bubble gum?

-Bubble gum?
-Bubble gum?

[Clicks, whirs]

[Pow

CLAW:
Ha ha ha! Missed us!

Looks like Gadget
just blew his last bubble.

Ha ha ha!

[Ascending
steel guitar chord plays]

I can't look.

Hmm.


-Huh?
-Huh?

[Gum squeaks]

Here comes the good part.

ALL: Aah!

Ha ha ha ha!

[All yelling]

Uhh! Let's get out of here!



BOTH: Whoa!


Now, that's what I call

a sticky situation.

-What do we do now?
-What we always do.

BOTH: We surrender!

Claw, come out with your hand
and your claw up!

[Tone buzzes]

-Whoa.
-What is that?

McKlBLE: I never knew
we had one of those.

CLAW: You may have won
this round...

but I'll get you next time,
Gadget.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[Dramatic music playing]

[Claw laughing]

GADGET: Come on.
It's not responding.

PENNY: He must've put in
his own security code.

-Then we'll just destroy it.
-No!

Then everyone
will be frozen forever.

We just have to think
like Claw.

What kind of a code would
a supervillain put in?


And I just lost it.

Wait a minute. I know.

Let's try
"Crime always pays."


Not always, Claw.


Hmm.

BOY: Oh. yeah!



And for heroically foiling
Dr. Claw and saving Riverton...

I would like to award
lnspectors Gadget and G2...

these distinguished
conduct medals...

for their service
to this city.

Yay!

Congratulations, Gadget.

CHlEF: I'd like to announce
that we are going to double...

the Gadget Unit's budget
for next year...

so that if Claw ever shows
his face in Riverton again...

we'll be ready for him.

Excuse me, Chief.

If I could just possibly...

Even just for a second.

The real secret to our success
has always been teamwork...

but there's
one member of our team...

who hasn't
been acknowledged yet.

And so,

for providing key support...

to members
of the Gadget team...

I would like to award
this Junior lnspector medal...

to Penny for
her meritorious conduct.

[Applause,
dramatic music playing]

I couldn't have done it
without you, Penny.

You are one special kid...

and I'm proud
to have you as a partner.

Thanks, Uncle Gadget.


Yes, Brain.

You're special, too.


GADGETMOBILE: Hello?
Anybody r.emember....

the inter.nal combustion
member. of the team?

What am I. scr.ap metal?
I helped. too.

Wher.e's my citation?

What ar.e you doing. man?

Not that kind of citation.

Good night, Gadget.
See you Monday.

Good night, Baxter.

-Night, Baxter.
-Bye.

Come on, Brain.

Inspector.

I wanted to say I may have been
a bit premature...

in my early evaluation
of your abilities.

That's very big of you, G2.

I was wrong to think of you
as inept, clumsy, imbecilic...

Don't mention it.

Obsolete, simple-minded,
malfunctioning--

Yes, yes.
I get the picture.

Anyway, I look forward to
more teamwork in the future.

[Electricity crackles]



Oh.

[Dramatic music playing]




I just love happy endings.

It must be a loose wire
or something.

I'll speak to Baxter about that.

Don't bother.

[Whistling, popping]

[Chimes tinkle]

CHlEF: Huh? Oh.

[Both gasp]

-Oh.
-Oh.

[Squeak, bam]

[Both cough]

-Gadget!
-Gadget!
