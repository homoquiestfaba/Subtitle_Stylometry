the tale of Jimmy Stubbins</i>

<i>and the golden jingle bells.</i>

<i>It all began 100 years ago when
the small town of Pleasant Bay</i>

<i>fell on hard times.</i>

<i>A drought caused the
local river to run dry,</i>

<i>which shut down the lumber mill,</i>

<i>putting most of the
townsfolk out of work.</i>

<i>Spirits were down
that Christmas Eve.</i>

<i>Kids like Jimmy
Stubbins went to sleep</i>

<i>with little hope of
getting any presents.</i>

[thuds, bells chiming]


[footsteps continue]

<i>Through his sleepy eyes,</i>

<i>he saw something that
had dropped from the sky.</i>

[soft instrumental
music playing]

<i>Golden jingle bells
from Santa's sleigh.</i>

<i>As Jimmy took the bells in his
hands and felt their magic,</i>

<i>he wished with all his
heart for the mill to reopen</i>

<i>so the town could
get back on its feet.</i>

<i>When he awoke on
Christmas morning,</i>

<i>there he saw a present
under the tree.</i>

[bells chiming]

<i>And, to his delight,</i>

<i>the strip of jingle bells
still lay by his bedside.</i>

Mom, Dad, come quick.


Look. Merry Christmas.

[knock on door]

Are you awake?

appeared at their door...</i>

Have you heard?

and the mill was reopening.</i>

<i>The townsfolk were all
getting their jobs back.</i>

<i>Jimmy knew his wish
had been granted.</i>

These bells must be magical!

Wh... what are these bells?

I was sleeping, and then
I heard Santa on the roof,

and then his sleigh was flying
away, and then his reindeer...

jingle bells spread quickly.</i>

<i>The bells were put on
display at the lumber mill</i>

<i>and became the town's
good luck charm.</i>

<i>People started coming to
Pleasant Bay from miles around</i>

<i>to see the bells and deliver
their own Christmas wishes.</i>

<i>The bells became a symbol of hope
for all who came to see them.</i>

<i>They were soon given a
home in the town's museum,</i>

<i>and every year on Christmas Eve,</i>

<i>the town held a Ringing
of the Bells ceremony.</i>

Merry Christmas!

see the bells and make their wishes...</i>

<i>Pleasant Bay and its
people began to flourish.</i>

And since that Christmas,

Pleasant Bay has had 100
years of prosperity and peace.

Some people say it's
just coincidence,

but true believers know it's all
because of the golden jingle bells.


There's customers waiting
for you at the gift shop.

I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I... I just
love telling the story of the bells.

I can take it from here.

[exhales softly]

This year marks

the 100th anniversary of Jimmy
Stubbins finding the bells.

So, this should be the biggest
Ringing of the Bells ever!

That's why people
come to our town,

to see the bells and to
make their Christmas wish.

Okay, are there any questions?

Yes, Violet, what's
your question?

How can Santa's sleigh still
fly when he's missing the bells?

has plenty of other bells.

Does he know these
bells are here?

Yes, he does. And he's
very happy about it.

These bells have brought so much
good fortune to Pleasant Bay.

How can those be Santa's bells when
there's no such thing as Santa?

Reggie, of course
there's really a Santa.

Right, Mr. Martin?

Absolutely, young lady.

See?
Naughty list.

There will always
be non-believers.

But don't let them rob you
of your Christmas spirit.

Christmas is a time of
goodwill towards all men,

and women, people, in general.

Good tidings to all the people.

All right, kids, feel free to look
around the rest of the museum.

[girl] Let's go look at the old fire truck.
Let's go over there.

What do you think that was for?

Probably for reaching
into your butt.

Kenny.


Are you okay, Mr. Martin?

Uh... Yeah, uh, just seem to
have misplaced my glasses.

You put 'em in your coat pocket
when you were yelling at Fiona.

Yelling?

maybe, but not... No.

I never put my gla... Oh...

Hey...

Hey now. [chuckles]

Thank you, Violet.

are you kids doing?

Dad!
[chuckles] Hey, buddy.

Hi, Mr. Bottoms.
Hey, Violet. How are ya?

You guys enjoying your visit?

Listen, I was thinkin' since
you don't have school tomorrow,

why don't we make it
a boys' night tonight?

Oh! Can we make popcorn
and watch<i> The Batman?</i>

Uh, I was thinking of something
a little more Christmassy.

Uh... how about<i> Elf?</i>

I love it when he eats
his spaghetti with syrup.

It's so gross!
That is so funny. [laughs]

Hey, I was looking at that.

Hey!

it back. Come on.

it? Come, get it.

Hey, be... be careful.
[boy] Quit being a jerk.

[Glenn] Boys, stop that.
[suspenseful music playing]

[dramatic music playing]
[Reggie] Whoa...


[dramatic music intensifies]

[George grunts]

[lilting music playing]

[exhales heavily]

[Violet whispering] Oh,
my God, did you see that?

It almost fell on his head.


Everything's fine.
No one's hurt. Right?

Yes. Thank you.

Did, uh... did that happen
because I didn't believe in Santa?

Lucky for you, I
do. [clicks tongue]

Okay, 20 more minutes, kids,

then the bus will be
taking you back to school.

Thank God.

[bell ringing]
[upbeat song playing]

Pumpkin pie's for Thanksgiving.
Pecan pie is for Christmas.

Pumpkin pie is for both.

It doesn't make any sense. The same
pie shouldn't get two holidays.

Oh, wanna go
sledding over break?

Do you even have to ask?

My dad said that there's
snow up on Table Mountain.

Maybe he could take us one day.


Come on. Mom said I have
to walk you home today.


No, sorry. I'm going
to the station.

Hey, Harrison.

Uh, any plans for the break?

Not really.

Yeah, me neither.

Um, I'll probably just
be hanging out at home.

Okay, um, good... good talk.

Violet, come on, let's go.

See you later, skater.
Catch you soon, baboon.

You wanna hear about
our science project?

We're gonna get
up early tomorrow

and walk all over town
and look for leaves.

[upbeat song continues]

Why am I going to
the station today,

and what are you doing
that's so important?

It's none of your business.

[upbeat music playing
on car stereo]

You're going to Patty's house

to work on the Student
Council Santagram fundraiser.

What?

You have art supplies
sticking out of your backpack,

and you put on lip gloss in
case Patty's brother is there.


Why can't you just act
like a normal 11-year-old?

[Violet chuckling]
Have fun at Patty's!

Hi, Sam.

Hey, Violet.

Hey, Deputy Terry.

Deputy Violet in da house.

Ooh! Can I have one of these?
Yeah.

Uh-uh! Not before dinner.


office. How can I help you?


[exhales sharply]

Hey, you.

Hi, Dad.

Oh, what you got there?

Science project
for winter break.

We're learning all about
the flora in Pleasant Bay.

Hmm.

We gotta find as many
leaves as possible.

Well, that sounds intriguing.

Oh, hey. Guess what?
We had a 10-90 today.

A 10-90?

A bank alarm?
Mmm-hmm.

Someone robbed a
bank in Pleasant Bay?

No, no, no. It's
just a wiring glitch.

False alarm.

Oh, man. Nothing exciting
ever happens around here.

Hey, that's exactly the way we
like it. Isn't that right, Terry?

That's right, Sheriff.

[soft instrumental
music playing]

at ya fresh out the oven.


Go ahead and dig in.
I have to get to work.

Not at the table.

Aren't we waiting for Dad?

I'm starving. Can
we just start?

We can do both.

You should have seen
Dad at the museum today.

He was all, like, flying ninja.

He saved a boy's life today.

Even though it was Reggie,
who is kind of a jerk.

Oh, wow, I would
like to see that.

All in a day's work.

[Margaret chuckles]

tries to start last night.


I'm picking up some extra
shifts at the school over break

so I can use that money
to pay for the car.

Okay.

I gotta get going.

[clears throat] Well, we are
set because we are having...

[in sing-song
voice] boys night.

You wanna watch<i> Elf</i> with
us tonight, Harrison?

I'm going to Doug's
after dinner.

too cool for us.

Hey, did you know
they are doing some

basketball tournaments
at the school over break?

We should check out a game, huh?

We should?

You know, I was a basketball coach
here before I moved to Portland

and met your mom, and
fell madly in love.

Yeah, we know.

We do?

State champs one
year or something.

Well, regional
champs, but still...

it was a big deal back then.

That's cool.

Well, don't keep this one
up too late... [kisses]

I won't. [chuckles]
Regional champ.

Love you.
Love you, Mom.

[George] Salad?
Nope.

Someone's an angry elf.



[Kenny laughs]

[Christmas song playing]

<i>â™ª I'd like Just
one-fashioned Christmas â™ª</i>

[whistling tune]

<i>â™ª Just like my
daddy Treasured so â™ª</i>

[continues whistling]

<i>â™ª A tree with Old-fashioned
trimmings... â™ª</i>

[ominous music playing]


Where's Dad?

He got a call. He had to go in.

I made you some extra
eggs, if you want some.

[sighs sharply] I really need
to teach you how to make coffee.

You should always start your
day with a healthy breakfast.

And you should always start
your day leaving me alone.

[doorbell rings]

That's Kenny.

We have a science project to do.

On the first day of break?

Hey, you want some eggs?

Sure.

Oh!

Do we have this one yet?

Nope. That's an<i>
Acer macrophyllum.</i>

A what?
A Bigleaf Maple.

Good find.

You're a great partner.

We should ride our
bikes to Rec Park.

They planted Pacific
Dogwoods back in 19...

Why is my dad at the museum?

[suspenseful music playing]

[police radio chatter]

[camera shutter clicking]

of forced entry?


must've had a key.

What about the alarm
system and the cameras?

It's all wired to
the main circuit.

Somebody cut the power.

They must have known where
the circuit breaker was.

And where is that?

It's outside, in the
back, by the meter.

They would have to have
a key for that, too.

Hey, Sam, check the
circuit breaker.

See if it was forced
open, and dust for prints.

Roger that.

This way.

Sorry, kids, we're closed today.

Hey, you two
shouldn't be in here.

[door creaks]

Violet.

Dad, what's going on?

Somebody stole the bells.

[sighs wearily]

I thought you secured the door.

Sorry, boss.
Yeah, put some tape outside.

We don't need anybody
else wandering in here.

On it.

[Pierce sighs]

Dad, stop.

What in the world
happened here last night?

you can't walk around in here.

This is an active crime scene.

So it's true, the
bells are gone.

Uh, yeah. It would seem so.

The Ringing of the
Bells is in three days.

You can't have a Ringing
of the Bells with no bells.

It's right in the name.

We're gonna do everything we can to
find the bells as quickly as possible.

Yeah, and just before
the election. Great.

My last accomplishment in the office
will be losing the town's pride and joy.

No one's gonna blame you, Dad.

How could you let this happen?

Dad.
Guys,

we really need to get back
to work. So, Deputy Terry,

could you please help the Mayor
delicately out of our crime scene?

Yeah. Come on, Dad.

Yeah, maybe my last
accomplishment in office

should be appointing
a new sheriff.

Three days before Christmas.
I can't believe it.

sheriff, he's got it handled.

You two need to go.

But, Dad...
I can't give you guys special treatment.

Not with the Mayor
breathing down my neck.

Okay.

wasn't forced open.

They must have had
a key to that, too.

Who has a key besides you?

Just one other person.

Your next-door neighbor.

Hey, George.

Hey, Grant.

Terry, Sam.

George.

What's going on?

Look, you mind if we
ask you a few questions?

Yeah. Yeah, sure. No problem.

Come on in.

Hey, uh... do me a favor.

Check my security camera
footage from last night.

Might have caught something.


I think Mr. Bottoms
is in trouble.

So, what time did
you leave the museum?

Glenn and I both left
about 6:45 or so.

And where'd you go?

Here. Home.

Harrison and Kenny and I
had dinner. Boys night.

Oh. Not Margaret?

No. She had picked up a
swing shift at the diner.

She didn't get back
till after 2:00.

And did you stay here
all night after that?

Yeah, I did.

You have your
museum keys on you?

Yeah. Right there
on the counter.

What about the high school?

You still picking up
custodial shifts there?

Yeah. Mostly on the weekends.
[Terry] Sheriff.

I have something
you need to see.

This is the video feed from your
site security camera last night.

1:12 a.m.

You mind if the deputies
look around a little bit?

Um, no.

Is your garage locked?

Side door's open.

What are you looking for, Grant?

The bells, George.

Somebody stole 'em last night.

What?

And you think they're here?



I think they're in the garage.

Why are they in the garage?

There's nothing in there. It's
just my grandma's old stuff.


[soft suspenseful music plays]

This is 'cause of my
previous arrest, isn't it?

Well, it was for
theft, wasn't it?

I got in with the wrong
people. I made a mistake. Okay?

What's going on?

Nothin', Harrison. Just
go back to your room.

Dad, what did you do?

I didn't... I didn't
do anything. Okay?

Just, please go
back to your room.


Found this tucked between
a few boxes in the garage.

What... How did... I don't
know how that got here.

You gotta believe me, I have no
idea how that got in my garage.

Where are the bells, George?

I don't know! I told you.
Grant, come on, listen to me.

Why would I steal the bells?

You know me.

George Bottoms...

Wait a minute. Guys...
you're under arrest.

I swear.

Dad?

Hey, it's okay, buddy.

It's just a
misunderstanding, is all.

It's gonna be fine.

Kenny, no.
Let go of me!

Kenny, wait! No.

taking Dad away?

Because he hasn't
changed. Okay?

Let me know if
you find anything.

You got it.

We can't go in the house
while they search it.

I called Mom at the diner.

She's gonna come get us
to go to the station.

Why don't you just have
her meet you there?

I can drive you guys.

Okay. Thank you.

Yeah. Let me get my keys.


[keyboard clacking]

Here.

pretty hard evidence.

[footsteps approaching]
[Kenny] Dad.

Hey. Hey, buddy.
[groans softly]

Dad, no. Not Mr. Bottoms.

What are you guys doing here?

We gave Harrison
and Kenny a ride.

Oh.

Your father didn't do this.

How do you know that?

Hey.

I did not take those bells.

Someone sure is trying to
make it look like I did.

Harrison...

you gotta trust me.

Yeah, right.

Let him go.

I know this is hard on him.

This is hard on all of us.

Harrison.

I believe you, Dad.

[sighs in relief]


What's that?

It's not good for Mr. Bottoms.

Sorry, Kenny.

George.

Come on.

Listen to me.

It's gonna be okay.

I'm gonna figure out
a way outta this.

I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.

George. It's time.

Look, I'm sorry, George.

I have to follow the evidence.

Another Christmas
without my dad.

I know what it's like to have Christmas
without one of your parents. It sucks.

My dad didn't do this, Violet.

You are the smartest
person I know.

You have to help us.

'Night, guys.
All right, good night.

There we go. [sighs sharply]

Dad?
Yeah?

I have a Christmas wish.

Oh, yeah? What is it?

I want Mr. Bottoms to be home
with Kenny for Christmas morning.

Oh, Violet...

I don't think Santa
can help with this.

If the bells are really magical,

then it'll happen.

You know, I wish it
were that simple.

Sheriff Pierce signing off.

Deputy Violet signing off.

I love you.

Love you, too.

Dad?

Yeah?

Did you find the bells
at the Bottoms house?

No. No, we searched
everywhere and...

they weren't there.

Doesn't it seem weird that the
case would be at the Bottoms house,

but not the bells?

Yeah, but maybe he already
did something with them.

Then why would he keep evidence
that would make him look guilty?


I want to help.

With what? Mr. Bottoms' case?

I can do something.

I don't want to just sit around and
wait for someone to solve the problem.

Well, that someone would be
me because that is my job.

You think it was Mr. Bottoms,

but I don't believe
that he would do this.

I know that he's Kenny's dad,

but sometimes money makes
good people do bad things.

Those bells are valuable.

Just get some rest, okay?


[mysterious music playing]

[doorbell dings]

Got any eggs?

Get in here.

Motive. Opportunity.

And what is that?

This is what my
dad does at work.

He makes a board for a case and
then puts pictures on it and things.

It's how he decides
on possible suspects.

So, for your dad...

Means. He had keys.

Motive.

The bells are worth money.

Opportunity.

His only alibi is that he
was home sleeping last night.

He could have snuck out of the
house while you guys were asleep.

How do you know
how to do all this?

I've learned a lot sitting at the
police station doing my homework.


What can we do?

We have to find another person
who has all three of these things.

Then we'll have another suspect.

Well, who else
could be a suspect?

I have one idea.

Are we gonna need
detective stuff?

[upbeat music playing]

I think it's closed.

Mr. Martin's car is here.

[door creaking]

[suspenseful music playing]

Sure is quiet in here.

Let's check it out.


He's probably in his office.
Wait here. I'll be right back.

[suspenseful music playing]

Hmm.

Mr. Martin?

I'm sorry. We
were closed today.

I just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

[exhales sharply]

Okay.

I only have a moment.

Why do you think Mr. Bottoms
would have stolen the bells?

Oh, I'm still hoping
it wasn't him.

He has been a wonderful
addition to the staff this year.

But it would probably
be for the money, right?

It usually is. Yes.

What is the museum's
donation money used for?

Just, general upkeep
of the museum, mostly.

Old buildings like these,
they're full of surprises.

If Mr. Bottoms was stealing
the bells for money,

why wouldn't he take
the donation money, too?

[suspenseful music playing]

[cell phone ringing]

[clears throat]

Ah. I really have to take this,
and then I have to lock up.

So, bye, Violet. Sorry.

Hi.

Hold on just a...

Thank you for your
time, Mr. Martin.

Bye, bye now.

[Mr. Martin clears
throat] Hello?

Yes.

Hey.

I handled the shoplifting
call at the M and M market.

Where's Sam?

Oh, she's out looking into
who vandalized Carl's garage.

What do you think's
going on, Sheriff?

I've never seen so
much crime here before.

I know the town needs its
Christmas spirit back.

We need to find these bells.

What's the latest on the pawn
shops and the jewelry stores?

No hits yet.

All right, well, stay on it.

Go into overtime if you
have to. Sam as well.

Uh, my Dad...

Uh, Mayor Donovan wants to
hold a press conference today.

About the bells. At noon.

I can run point
for the department.

No, no, I have to be there.
This is too important

for your dad and the town.

Yes, sir. I understand.

Why don't you come, too?

[sighs wearily]


Who else has a key to the
museum? Mr. Martin, obviously.

And he was acting kind of funny.

What's the second "M" again?

Motive. Most likely money.

Sometimes money makes
good people do bad things.

Why does he need money?

That's what we need to find out.

[cell phone rings]

I counted the money.
It's a good haul.

Oh, you don't need to do that.

I can meet you
somewhere about halfway.

How about the pier?

I'm on my way, okay?

He's going to the pier.
We gotta beat him there.

How are we gonna do that?

He's got a dozen
stoplights to get through.

If we take the footbridge,
we can get there first.

[Kenny groans]

[Violet] Come on, Kenny!
[grunts]

[tense music playing]


Slow down!

This way, Kenny.


Not the stairs.


[tense music continues]

[Kenny grunting]

[tires screech]

There's his car.


[tense music continues]


Pedestrians ahead!

[grunts]
Whoops!

Hey! Watch out!

Sorry!

Merry Christmas!


[Mr. Martin] Barbara.

How are you?

That's not Mrs. Martin.

Well, guess what?
What?

We did really well this year.

Yeah, the donations
were through the roof.

[speaking imperceptibly]


museum's donation money.

Well, now we're never gonna
know where the money's gone.

We can use the police computers
to look up her license plate.

That doesn't sound legal.

That's why we're not
going to tell anybody.


[crowd clamoring]


Where is the bell?

-Guys, guys, guys, please. Please, I...
-[woman] Mayor!

There's never been this
many reporters before.

Mayor!
Hold on a second, please.

I can't hear the lady's
question. Yes, ma'am?

Are you going to cancel the
Ringing of the Bells celebration?

Absolutely not!

The great town of Pleasant Bay

represents the joy and
spirit of Christmas.

Not without the bells.


That's the whole
reason everyone comes.

Yes, I...
If no one's here on Christmas Eve,

my bakery's out a lot of money.

Yes, I understand.

I've had 15 cancellations at my
hotel in the last 24 hours, Mayor.

The bells are the
key to everything.


Yes, yes. Friends, friends.

Keep that Pleasant
Bay spirit up.

Stay hopeful,
because in this town

we believe in Christmas
spirit, don't we?

[scattered cheering]
And we believe... Yes!

And we believe in the bells.

This is great publicity
for the mayor.

publicity for the mayor.

But not if the bells are
found before Christmas Eve.

Then he would be a hero,
and get a lot of attention.

And with the
election coming up...

that's motive.

And we believe that
our fine police force

will find our bells
before Christmas Eve.

Wait, but what
about Mr. Martin?

We can't just focus
on one suspect, Kenny.

That's the mistake my dad
is making with your dad.

But what if you don't find
the bells before Christmas?

[others] Yeah!
Or ever?

We have Sheriff
Pierce on the case.

He has promised me

that he will return the bells
to their rightful place.

Am I right, Sheriff?


these are our suspects.


Violet...

you don't seriously think you
can solve this case, do you?

Why not?

I mean, for starters, you still
sleep with a stuffed animal.

I already have two new suspects.

She's trying to get my
dad home before Christmas.

And that's in two days, Maddie.

Kenny, I'm... I'm really
sorry about your dad.

I hope it's all just
a misunderstanding.

Can you drive me and Kenny
to the police station?

I just got home.

Kenny's mom is there
visiting his dad.

Kenny wants to go, too.

Uh, yeah.

Could you, please?

Fine.

I'll take you.

You don't... um...

you don't think your brother
would want to go, do you?

Um, I don't think so. He's
kinda mad about all of this.

He's been moping around
the house all day.

Of course. Um...

Okay, grab your stuff.

All right, here you go.



If you're going to check in on Harrison,
your lip gloss is in the glove box.

All the business owners
are calling my office

worried no one will
come to the celebration

if the bells aren't found
before Christmas Eve.

I know, Dad. I'm
sorry about that.

They'll be found.

Now, how can you be so
sure about that, Violet?

The bells mean everything
to Pleasant Bay.

No one is going to rest until the
bells are back where they belong.

this girl the new sheriff.

She's the only one with any
determination around here.

We're doing the best we can.

Yeah, well, if your best doesn't
include finding the bells,

it's not enough.


He's out right now.
I can take a message.

Your dad's out on
a call, Violet.

I just came with Kenny.

He wants to see his dad.

Is that okay?

Oh, yeah. Yeah, of
course. Come on, Kenny.

Your mom's already back there.

I'm just gonna wait
in my dad's office.

Okay.

[suspenseful music playing]

Business is down at the diner
since those bells were stolen.

People's moods are, too.


gotta keep up hope.

How are you holding up, son?

I'm okay, Dad.

Um, Violet's helping,
too. She's really smart.

[chuckles softly]

Well, thank you, Kenny.

And you make sure
you tell Violet

I really appreciate it.

And, uh...

tell Harrison I really miss him.

Password. Mom's birthday.

[stealthy instrumental
music playing]


Okay, tell me what happened.

Yes, as soon as he gets back.

Uh-huh. I'll let
the sheriff know.

[tense music playing]


Hey, what you doing?

I was just looking up
something for my project.

On the police database?
[sighs]

I just had an idea who
might have stolen the bells.


We're pretty sure we
know who stole the bells.

I just want to look up
a license plate number.

Does your dad know
you're doing this?

No.

I don't like the idea of you
keeping secrets from your dad.

I just don't want to worry him.

Well, little kids aren't
allowed on the police database.

But police officers are.

Are you a police officer?

No, but you are.


All right. You're gonna have to tell
me a lot more if you want my help.

Fine. I'll tell you everything. But
you have to promise you'll help me.

Hey.

Hey.

Do you maybe wanna
talk about anything?

You don't have to be
nice to me, you know.

I'm not just being nice.

I thought you might
need a friend.

[slow instrumental
music playing]

I guess that doesn't
sound so bad.

Do you really think that your
dad could have done this?

He's stolen before.
That's why he was in jail.

What did he steal?

Well, nothing, really.

He stole nothing
and went to jail?

He worked in a huge warehouse,
and someone recruited him

to make a delivery
for a few extra bucks.

The truck was full
of stolen goods.

Oh, no.

Yeah. He swears he
knew nothing about it.

You don't believe that?

All I know is, we spent eight months
without him while he was in jail,

and everyone at school looked at me
like I was the son of a criminal.

I'm sorry.
[softly] Yeah.

My dad grew up here,

so we moved here from Portland when
he got out, you know? Start fresh.

My grandma had
left us this place.

Yeah, I remember her.

I'm really sorry
about her passing,

but I'm also really glad that you
got a chance to have a fresh start.

Now I'm the son of
a criminal again.

I just can't get away from it.

Is that why you're
not on social media?

You tried to look me up?

[clicks tongue]

Maybe.

Can you at least
tell me her name?

No, Violet. I already looked up the
license plate number like you asked.

Now you have to do the
rest of this on my terms.

Fine.

Are these cupcakes?

They were cupcakes.

Sorry. Meant to
throw that away.

It's not usually
such a mess in here.

Is that a London plane leaf?

Can I have this?

The leaf?

Yeah. It's for a
science project.

Sure. You can have the leaf.

I don't currently
have any plans for it.


What, the tins?

Yeah, um, my mom, she used to
collect this kind of stuff.

This one is in pretty
good condition.

What happened to your mom?

Most people get kind of
uncomfortable talking about my mom.

I'd like to hear about her.

Well, um...

she was an amazing person.

She was so funny.

she would do these little voices

when she would tell
us bedtime stories.

And she actually made Violet
pee her pants one time.

Poor Violet.

Yeah, no, it wasn't Violet.

She made me pee my pants one time.
Yep.


The, um...

The cancer...

[melancholy music playing]

came on...

pretty quick.

And then one day...

she was just gone.

[breath trembling]

How did Violet take it?

She was so little.

I have no idea how
she processed it.

How did you process it?

haven't yet, either.

up and I walk into her kitchen

hoping she'll be there, so...

My dad chose not to
be in our kitchen.

I really wish you
didn't think like that.

How can you have a relationship with
him if you spend every day blaming him?

Take it from me.

One day, it'll be too late.

The Ashton Home?

That's what came up when I
searched the license plate.

Mr. Martin is stealing
money for a children's home?

Stealing? Uh...

Um, our newest deputy here

saw you giving some money to
a woman from the Ashton Home.

Barbara?

Yes, I did.

See? I told you. He lied to me.

That was our Christmas donation.

For presents, for the
children at the home.

Presents for children?
Not much of a crime.

But he...

You told me the donation
money was for museum upkeep.

It is.

Then why were you giving
it to the Ashton Home?

Oh. Those were our
December donations.

Everything from the first
three weeks in December

goes to the children's home.

But he said...

What about the bells?

The bells?
You have a key to the museum.

You could have taken the bells that
night as easily as Mr. Bottoms.

I...

I was at the Spirit
River Casino all night...

Did anyone see you there?

A lot of people saw
him there, Violet.

Cameras, too. We already
checked his alibi for that time.


I did that.

This is why 11-year-olds shouldn't
be running police investigations.

You called my dad?

It's for your own good, Violet.

You shouldn't be interfering
with this, Violet.

Dad, I...
You're just a kid.

I can still help.

But you're not helping.

You're taking me away from
the actual investigation.

Mom would have
thought I could help.

Violet...

She wouldn't just see
me as some dumb kid.



Dad?

We've had a rough day.

[knock on door]

You okay?

I'm fine.

I just wish I could have got
Mr. Bottoms home for Christmas.

Is this about something else?

[breath trembling]

I wish Mom was here.

She is.

She's in you.

She's in me.

She's part of
everything that we do.

Why didn't anyone save her?

Yeah.

Mom didn't die because
we didn't do enough.

Everyone did everything
that they could.

I wish I could have saved her.

Oh, Vi.

You couldn't have.

You know that getting
Mr. Bottoms home for Christmas...

it won't bring Mom
home for Christmas.

I had to at least try.

But you can't go around
accusing other people, Vi.

Not without real proof.

[Maddie sniffles]

You know, the best thing about
you, it isn't your big brain...

it's your big, giant heart.

I love you, Maddie.

I love you, too.

[whimsical music playing]

A little late, Terry.

I didn't get home till
after midnight last night.

Well, it's not letting up out
there. There is a list on your desk.

All right.

We're shorthanded right now.
We'll get somebody on it.

Deputy Violet.

In the house.

Hi, Terry. Maddie was
busy this morning.

She should be here any
minute to get me, though.

Always happy to have you here.

You still mad at me?

No.

I get why you called my dad.

It's fine. I'm done
investigating anyways.

Don't worry. We're
gonna solve this case.

I just wanna say
bye to Mr. Bottoms.

No problem.

Hey, Mr. Bottoms.

How are you doing?

Hey, Violet.

I'm okay. All
things considered.

Maggie brought me a change
of clothes, which was nice.

I hear you're on the case.

I was, but Deputy
Terry ratted me out.



How long have you known him?

I knew him from back in my
basketball coaching days.

His dad asked me to make
him an assistant coach.

Instill some discipline.

How'd that go?

Not good.

I had to fire him.

He wasn't too happy about
that. Neither was his dad.

You know, the mayor
is pretty hard on him.

But look at him now.
I guess it worked out.

Look at him now?

The mayor asked my dad to
give him this job, too.

That's the reason he works here.
[chuckles]

I guess it's all about
who you know, isn't it?

I guess.

Bye, Mr. Bottoms.

Bye, Violet.

[suspenseful music playing]

[music increases in tempo]

Mr. Bottoms, do you
own any white sneakers?

White sneakers? No.

Pretty much, these are my work
boots. It's all I ever wear. Why?

I think I might have
to reopen your case.

Okay.

[tense music playing]

Maddie, I think I
found some proof.

Violet Pierce, I thought
you were done with this.

I was wrong about Glenn Martin,
but this is the real thing.

Violet.

If there's anything we can
do to help Mr. Bottoms,

shouldn't we at least try?

Buckle your seat belt.

Do you think Harrison would
be willing to look at this?

What are we looking at?

This is our home security footage
my dad had on his computer.

It sees over the
fence, into your yard.

They think that's your
dad going into the garage.

That's why they searched there.

It could be.


You can't actually see him go in or
out of the house, from this angle.

but look at this.

What is that?

That looks like it could be
the logo from the museum.

It's on all of our dad's
work shirts and jackets.

But how many does he have?

Jackets?

I don't know. A couple.
He does keep one at work.

What about this?

Whoever took the bells also
took a jacket from the museum

so they would look
like your dad.

Then he could have put it
right back when he was done.

That's a stretch.

Violet, we can barely see
anything in this video.

It's too grainy and dark.

this. Look at his shoes.

White sneakers with two stripes.

people own white sneakers.

Yeah, but my dad doesn't.

He hates how white
shoes get dirty so fast.

But do you know who does own
white sneakers with two stripes,

just like those?

Deputy Terry.

You think Deputy
Terry stole the bells?

[dramatic music plays]

old grudge with Mr. Bottoms.</i>

I had to fire him.

He wasn't too happy about that.

He went out of his way to stop me
from looking into other suspects.

<i>Terry knows all the details of
the case and everyone involved.</i>

<i>He's been to my house,</i>

<i>he knows about the
security cameras.</i>

He could have been messing with
Dad's investigation this whole time.

But why would Terry steal
the bells? For money?

For attention. If Deputy Terry finds
the bells right before Christmas Eve,

he's going to be the town
hero. That's his motive.

She's good.

So do we tell your dad?

No.
No.

After what happened with
Mr. Martin at the museum,

we need actual proof.

Terry's sneakers
isn't enough evidence.

Although a really
weird coincidence.

Where can we get more evidence?

We have to find the bells.
That's the real proof.

What do you wanna do?

Break into Terry's house?
See if the bells are there?

No, we can't do that.

But he does leave a lot
of stuff in his car.

Hey, you're back.

Hi, Deputy Terry.

You forget something?

Uh, I was just wondering if
I could see my dad again.

Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Come on, follow me.

[cell phone ringing]

Hey, I'm pretty busy, Dad. No.

[suspenseful music playing]

She did it.

Let's go.

Oh, come on.

[suspenseful music continues]

a little bit more faith in me.

I don't know. Have you tried
unplugging it and restarting it?

[tense music continues]

Hey, Dad, I... I'm
pretty busy right now.

I gotta go.

Maddie.

Come on, let's go.


Violet.

You caught me.

Just take one. Okay?

Okay.

No, I'm not having
trouble with Violet, Dad.

Everything's fine.

Hey, Violet, um, we need to go.


I know. I'm sorry,
that's my fault.

Um, can you grab Kenny?

Sisters. Am I right?

Hmm.

Oh, there you are.

There were no bells in Terry's
car. Mostly just regular cop stuff.

Oh, man.

But I did find something that
was a little weird. A map.

"Department of Public Works?"

Hey, that's... that's
where Terry worked

before he started at
the sheriff's office.

Man, Terry's had a lot of jobs.

Is this a tunnel map?

similar in Portland.

They're called the
Shanghai tunnels.

They connect Downtown Portland
to the Willamette River.

They run all over the city.

All under the city.

All under the city, yeah.

But there's access
points all across town,

and just like these tunnels right
here in Pleasant Bay. And, look.

There happens to be one right
under the Pleasant Bay museum.

That's means.

You don't need a key to the front door
if you're coming through a tunnel.

We have motive and means
now. This is getting good.

We have to find

that tunnel entrance under the museum.
[Harrison] Yeah.


Hey!

What are you guys doin'?
Nothing.

We were, uh... we
were just leaving.

[engine starts]

[tense music playing]

It's definitely closed today.

Now what?

Well, that's why we
stopped at our house.

To grab my dad's
backup set of keys.

That's why they think he
did it, right? His keys.

Don't you also think he did it?

No. Not anymore.

And I wanna find out who did.

Wait! The alarm!

I know how we can deactivate it.

As long as one of those keys also
opens the circuit breaker box.

[suspenseful music playing]

If there's an access
tunnel in this building...

it's probably down there.

You should go and check.

We're all going down together.

[suspenseful music continues]

[Harrison] Got it?
[Maddie] Yeah.


[sighs in relief]

for a door or something.

Okay. Violet and I
will take this side.




Nothing.

Nothing on our side either.

Maybe there's another basement.

We have to check
under these boxes.

Okay, but how could someone
get out through the ground

and then also use the
boxes to cover the opening?

Deputy Terry was down
here the next morning

<i>while they were investigating.</i>

He could have put boxes over
the opening to cover his tracks.


lift with your legs.



[suspenseful music playing]

That sure looks like something.

Whoa!



Now what?

We have to find
out where it goes.

that's such a great idea.

Man up, Kenny.

That's sexist.

Give me a hand.

like power conduits.

Gas lines, water pipes maybe.

What's that?

Looks like an emergency
power shutoff.

That's how Terry could have
deactivated the security system.

He could have done
it from down here.

[loud clanking]


It's fine. It's just the pipes.

I got this. Stay behind me.

That's also sexist.

But I'm also gonna
stay behind you.

[suspenseful music continues]


see where it goes.

Maybe we'll find
clues along the way.


[clanking]
[Kenny gasps]

Pipes, Kenny.

[music continues]



This does not feel safe.

So, should we split up?

No!

Let me see the map.

What are you looking for?

I'm not sure yet.

Where would Deputy Terry
come into these tunnels?

There.

That's it.

The school? Why there?

It's surrounded by
London plane trees.

So?
I found a London plane tree leaf in Deputy Terry's car.

<i>He's been there recently.</i>

The school was closed
that day for winter break.

Wait.

But then how would Deputy Terry
get into the school that night?

They have a lock box

for police to use in
case of emergencies.

The school it is.

[suspenseful music playing]


Looks like some kind of storage.

There. That should
be the school.

There's a hatch.

Now we tell your dad?

No, not yet.

I'll go up first.

Breaking into school. Never
thought I'd be doing this.

Come on.

So, this is our school?

Yeah, we're in the boiler room.

Look.
Oh.

Our dad works here on the
weekends to make extra cash.

He also used to coach
basketball here, too.

That's right. A long
time ago, with Terry.

Deputy Terry?

Is that just a coincidence or...

No.

Terry plans to find
the bells here.

If Terry finds the bells here,

that's another thing
connected to your dad.

It'll make him look
even more guilty.

So, the bells could
actually be here right now?

No, but our dad already
searched the school,

and he said the
bells weren't here.

Maybe they were just focused on places
related to Mr. Bottoms' work as a janitor.

Your dad used to coach here.

Terry could have planted the
bells somewhere related to that.

You're right.

Come on, let's check it out.

[Kenny groans]

This is so weird.

Okay, there's the gym, there's the
locker room, there's Coach's office.

There's so many hiding spots.
The bells could be anywhere.

let's start looking.

Maddie and I will start
with the locker rooms.

Okay, I'll start with the bins.
I'll check the lockers.


I have an idea.

Great. What?

Do that thing where you think
about something for a moment

and then you have
a brilliant idea.

Kenny, be serious. The Ringing
of the Bells is tomorrow.

Come on, I'll help
you. [clears throat]

The bells.

The bells. The bells.

Kenny, stop. We have to
just look everywhere.

Fine.


Kenny, don't move.

What?
Let me see under your foot.

That's from the bell's
display case at the museum.

How do you know?

I found a piece just like
it when we were there.

It had a purple
tint just like it.

Yeah. Good one, Kenny.

If this is where Terry took the
bells out of a pocket or a bag,

some glass could
have fallen out.

That means he was about to
hide them somewhere close.

But where?


You heard that, too, right?


[mysterious music playing]

The trophy case.

Of course. Guys, come here!

What?


My dad's trophy.

Um... his keys.

One of them should
open the trophy case.

[keys jangling]

Got it!

Okay.

Oh, my gosh!

The bells! We did it!
You did it, Violet!

You found the bells!

Violet, you did it!
Great job, Violet.

Now do we call Dad?

Now we call Dad.

Okay.

But don't mention me using his computer.
Okay.

Or searching Terry's car.

[Maddie] Okay.
Or breaking into the museum.

This is going to be
a very short story.

[thumping]
[bells tinkling]

Someone's here.

[suspenseful music playing]

Maybe it was just the wind.


I found the bells
at the high school.

It's Deputy Terry.

He's here to grab the bells.

Let's get outta here.

No. Let's punch this guy in
the face. He framed our dad.

No. This is our chance
to get more proof.

guys the exclusive on this.

You're gonna wanna get a news
crew over here right away.

I have an idea.


[Sam on radio]<i> Yeah, go ahead.</i>

I found them. I
found the bells.

You remember how George used to
be a coach at the high school?

They're right here
in the trophy case.

We gotta get a forensic
kit over here right away.

[Sam on radio]
<i>That's great, Terry.</i>

<i>Sheriff Pierce isn't too far.</i>

<i>I'll radio for him
to head your way.</i>

Copy that.

No, no. No, no, no.

Something wrong?

Violet?

What are you doin' here?

I was just looking
for the bells.

What are you doing here?

Same thing.

I remembered that George, he...
he used to be a coach here.

Yeah.

He fired you, didn't he?

Yeah. It was a long time ago.

He didn't respect
my opinions. It...

it wasn't a good fit.

That must have been really
disappointing for your dad.

Losing a job like that.

Yeah.

Well, he's gonna see
how capable I am...

when I'm the one
who finds the bells.

Right. You'll be the
hero when you find them.

Your dad's finally going
to be proud of you.

He might even make
you the new sheriff.

Just doing my job.

Is it your job to
frame an innocent man?

George Bottoms isn't innocent.

He's an ex-con.

People don't change, Violet. Once
a criminal, always a criminal.

That's a funny thing
for a criminal to say.

Me?

I'm just investigating.

And your investigation somehow took you to
the exact hiding spot the bells were in?

You were so sure, you even told
Deputy Sam you already had them.

No, no, I didn't...

I... I told her that I thought
I was about to find them.

That's not what I heard.

Should I replay the video I have of
you going straight to the hiding spot?

<i>They're right here
in the trophy case.</i>

<i>We gotta get a forensic
kit over here right away.</i>

Let me have the phone, Violet.

I really shouldn't. I think this
video, the tunnel map in your car,

and the two-striped sneakers
on the security camera footage

are going to be all the proof my dad needs
to put you in jail instead of Mr. Bottoms.

[ominous music playing]

Give me the phone.

Okay.

That's enough.


[sighs wearily]

Don't worry.

I caught it.

[sighs wearily]

You're making a big mistake.

You're not acting like I am.

The phone.

Please.

I don't have it.

I'm done playing
games with you guys.


[dramatic music playing]


you dropped something.

[Harrison] Kenny, now!
[Kenny] Got it!

Let me out!

We heard Sheriff
Pierce is on his way.

We can let you out then.

I'm just gonna
destroy this phone.

And the video that's on it.
Go ahead.

We already have the video of you going
straight to the bells' hiding spot

on the phone my brother has.


Hey! Let me out!

[curious instrumental
music playing]

[reporter 1] Does this have anything
to do with the missing jingle bells?

[reporter 2] Deputy Donovan...

Come on, guys, back off.
-Deputy, do you have anything to say?

I'll have a statement
for you tomorrow.

[reporter 2] ...George Bottoms?

[reporter 1] Okay.

I thought I told
you to stand down.

I know, Dad, but he was messing
with your investigation,

and he was your deputy.

How could you have known?

I couldn't let him do that.

I'm not sure how
you guys did this.

I'm not sure you want to know.

I had a lot of help.

I stepped on the glass.

Is that right?

I broke into the museum.

I was the getaway driver.

Yeah.

Everyone pitched in, Dad.

I'd better take those. [sighs]

And we will talk about
this when we get home.

But...

you guys did good.

You, um...

I'm sorry, Dad.

No, no. I'm sorry, son, if I made you

I just want you

Oh, son.

You're gonna get

I'm here with you.

Okay.

Oh, boy.

Look at you.

It's one of Maddie's

Hmm. Well, that is...
that is lovely on you.

Maddie said I remind her of Mom.

Oh, yeah. Wow.

You sure do.

Uh, you are, um... [chuckles]

You are funny, and you
are kind, and so smart.

[chuckles] Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

You know who else
you remind me of?

Who?

Me.

You won't let anyone tell you
what to do or how to behave,

or when to take
"no" for an answer.

You got a little
