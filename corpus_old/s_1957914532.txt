We're on in 30.

Ready, graphics? Ready camera?

Graphics?

You know our next act as the
recent winner of Pop Star USA.

And, her new single, which
keeps climbing the charts...

"Baby, My Baby, Won't
You Be My Baby?"


That is a lot of baby's, right.


Please join me in
welcoming the lovely...

Jaylen Rodriguez!


Thank you so much for having me.

â™ª [Pop music] â™ª

â™ª I DON'T WANT TO SAY
THAT WE MISSED OUT. â™ª

â™ª THINK I WANT TO
LOSE CONTROL. â™ª

â™ª 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK BACK ONE DAY. â™ª

â™ª IF WE NEVER TRY,
WE'LL NEVER KNOW. â™ª

â™ª THERE'S ALWAYS A
RISK OF A LETDOWN. â™ª

â™ª TO FIND OUT WHERE
FOREVER GOES. â™ª

â™ª THINK THAT IF I FALL,
YOU'LL CATCH ME. â™ª

â™ª 'BOUT TO FIND OUT, BABY. â™ª

â™ª HERE WE GO. â™ª

â™ª I CAN'T SLEEP. â™ª

â™ª TOO BUSY THINKING 'BOUT â™ª

â™ª YOUR HANDS ON ME. â™ª

â™ª I WANT TO KNOW, DO I... â™ª

â™ª DO I COME ACROSS
YOUR MIND? â™ª

â™ª 'CAUSE BABY, BABY, YOU'RE
THE ONLY THING ON MINE. â™ª

â™ª OH, YEAH, YEAH. â™ª

â™ª BABY, BABY, YOU'RE THE ONLY
THING THAT'S ON MY MIND. â™ª

[Applauding]
And we're clear!


Oh! Did it play well?
Yes.

Ah! It's always so weird when

there's no one in the audience.

Trust me, you brought
down the house!

The internet is going crazy.

People who didn't even
know you on Pop Star USA

sure know who you are now.

Ah!
And, we're going on tour.

We're going on tour!
We're going on tour!

We're going on tour.
We're going on tour!

We're going on tour.

â™ª

I got an update.

I'm getting real-time data
from the record label,

and ticket sales are already up.

Oh, that's great to hear.

Imagine if we threw a
tour and nobody came?


You know, this whole
self-deprecating thing is

charming and all, but you
got to start acting like

the star that you are.

Hey, this is all new to me. I
will never be a diva, Benny.


Know how many clients I've
had who've told me that?

Of course, you're the first
one that I actually believe.

Hey, thanks again,
for putting your trip

back a few days to do this.
This is gonna pay off.

I hope so, because my family
was not thrilled about that.

Yeah, well, they're
gonna get over it.


don't know her family.

They get over nothing.
Ever since we were kids.

It's kind of their thing.
True.

You know, they know what's best,

and who am I to tell
them they're wrong?

Well, you could...

But you don't.
Okay, guys, time to go.

Oh.
Got it?

Time to go. Get your
stuff, get your stuff.

Alright.

I just got a text from the
President of Blue Six Records.

They are quite
pleased with you, Jay.

Oh, that's amazing!

But did they ever
listen to my songs?

Look, they invested
a lot in you.

That's why they rented
out studio in your town

for you to rehearse
over Christmas.

It's why they're
flying in Tyler Huston

to teach you choreography.

Well, that sounds great, but
I'm gonna take that as 'no'.

I'm just a commodity to them.

Well, a little
bit, welcome to LA.

No, Benny, listen...

In my culture, music
is not just music.

It is a soundtrack of our lives.

It's a part of every moment,

and I want to give
the fans the music

that has been a gift
to me, my whole life!

I could be a crossover
artist, both markets.

Sing songs in
English and Spanish.

Yes, you can, but,
right now, they have

fantastic writers working
on material just for you.

Like, the best of the best.

Songs with more
"baby" in the title!

[Benny groans]
Exactly!

It's like working
with my family.

Everyone else knows
what's best for me,

but no one cares
what I want or think.

Look, you are new on the scene,

and we have to go
with the momentum.

You have to prove
to the label that

you are a team player.
Remember the plan, okay.

We're gonna get to your songs.

You just gotta be patient.

Hey! I'm not gonna
let you down, Jay.

You're like the
daughter I never had.

You have two daughters, Benny.

Yeah, but they're five.

You're like the grown
up daughter I never had.

[Fans shouting outside]

Aye, Benny, Benny, Benny.

[Speaking Spanish]

You gotta teach me
some of that Spanish.


What she said was nice, right?

Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

Oh, my.
Oh!

[Cheering]
Hi, hi, hi!

Hello, whoa.
No, no, no.


Abuela's gonna see this.

We'll figure how to spin it,
it'll be fine, it'll be fine.

are you wearing?

Yeah, here we go.

[Angry fan] Get out of my way!

[Fans shouting & screaming]


â™ª

car, stop the car.

Hold on, hold on, hold on.
What's going on?

Why is the gate open?

We closed it before we left.

I always check.
She does.

I really did.
She does, Benny.

[Camera shutter clicking]

Hey, hey! Beat it, guy! Go!

Get the window up.
Up, window, up,

let's go, go, go,
go! Go, go, go!

Are you serious?

â™ª [Whimsical orchestral] â™ª



â™ª [Music slows] â™ª

[Car door opening]

[Car door closing]

Benny, how does he
know where I live?

This is a rental.

Paps are annoyingly resourceful.

Wow.

You think that guy...

put these here?

No, no, he knows to
stay on public property.

He just wants to get
a candid shot of you

shoving fruitcake in your mouth.

No, these, and that gate,

I think somebody was in here.

Like, inside?

In here.


Okay...

Thank you.
So, good news...

There's no signs of
forced entry inside.

Thank you so much.

You know...

I was in an a cappella
group in college,

called Tone Def.

D-E-F.

Oh.
[Chuckling]

BA-BA-BOM BOM-BOM-BOM-BOM

IT CAME UPON A
MIDNIGHT CLEAR...

That's beautiful,
that's... gorgeous.

Yeah. [Clearing throat]

I was talking to your
guys back there and

they're telling me that
there's gonna be nothing

on the security cams,
and the flowers,

the prints are
only gonna be ours,

is that right?

Might I suggest a Doberman?

Thank you so much
for rushing over!

You guys, you guys are great.


[Indistinct police radio]

I spoke to Barb, at the label.

About this?
Yes, I had to text her.

Somebody came onto the property.

What are the odds she
listened to some of

Jay's songs and wants
to add them to the tour?

Not so great.

They want to get security
and they got this company

they like to use.

So, okay, that's not all.
Ah, the security guy,

they want him to
be with you 24/7.

What does that mean?

That means that he goes
home with you to...

to, where is it
you're from again?

Squirrel Hollow.

That's made up, that's
gotta be made up.

Benny!

You don't know my family.

I can't bring some stranger
home with me for Christmas.

I can't be there to protect you.

I weigh 165 pounds soaking wet,

and if I miss another
holiday for work,

I'll be divorced by Friday.

We don't want that, but
I'm not asking for this.

Tell 'em my brother was
an all-star wrestler

in high school. That works.

Yes!
That'll work, that'll be fine.

This is non-negotiable.

They're gonna think the worst.

Abuelo and Abuela
are from Mexico.

A little bodyguard
means serious business.

It's in the contract. They
get to call the shots.

Are they overreacting?
Probably.

Do we want to rock the boat
this close to the tour?

We do not.

Fine. [Sighing].

But we will get them
to listen to my songs.

We will get there,
but right now,

we're gonna keep you safe.

Oh, hey, oh, ah!


What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

You're trespassing!

Okay, just a little
piece of advice,

next time you hear
a suspicious sound,

maybe stay inside
with your phone,

and then use it to
call the police.

Thanks for the tip.

Now, who are you,
huh? Paparazzi?

You're not allowed
on private property.

Matt Lowis.

I was sent by Blue Six
Records to protect you.

Right.

You put all your
bosses in a headlock,

or am I just special?

I'm sorry... Okay?

I was doing a sweep, looking for

vulnerabilities
on your property,

which are numerous, by the way.

Not the least of which,

the woman I'm supposed
to be protecting

making herself
completely vulnerable.

So, what'd you break?

I heard a crash.

I don't know, I think it was...

a gnome?

You killed Lenny?
It was a gnome.

[Exasperated sigh]

Do you have any coffee?
Yeah.

[Smoke detector beeping]

Oh! Look what you made me do!


Oh, this is not
starting off well.

Well, at least the
smoke detector works.

And all the deadbolts
work on the outside doors.



Yeah, we're gonna have
to call the landlord.

I could jimmy the
laundry room door open

with my bobby pin.

[Beeping stops]

You carry bobby pins with you?

Yeah, you never know
when you have to use 'em.


Maybe for hair emergencies.
You're very thorough.

Yeah, well, I'm
good at what I do.

Ah, clearly...

Cookie?

Oh, thanks.

I didn't realize gingerbread
men wore dresses.

They do at Christmas,
although...

these aren't looking
good, and these are burnt,

thanks to you, and...

I'll have to figure out
when to go to the panderia.

Listen, um...

My manager thinks the
label is overreacting.

Do you?

Well, it's not for me to say.
[Door beeping]

I'm just here 'til
they tell me I'm done.

[Margot] Hola!
Well, here and Squirrel Hollow.

We have a problem.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Whoa, whoa?
Who are you?

Who are you?

This is my best friend
and personal assistant.

You do not have to cuff her.

My new security.
Bodyguard.

Matt.
Margot.

Yeah, so, your cop friend
wants to be a hero.


We do not believe
the intruder at

Jaylen Rodriguez's home
last night is related...

No!

To the string of
robberies in the area.

No, no, no, no!
[Phone ringing]

And there it is.
Mm... mhm.

Oi! It's her, watch.


An intruder?!

No one was inside.
It was just a...

wrong delivery, wrong address.

But your home is Fort Knox.

Nobody could accidentally
get in there.


You can still go to LA
and record your records.

And then come back home.

Then, we can protect you.

That's not how it
works, Abuelita.

Cousin Jorge said not
moving to LA was the

best decision he ever made.

Si.

Well, Cousin Jorge
also didn't get into

any schools here.

I don't know how much more of
this Abuela's heart can take.

Think of what this
worry is doing to her!

Stop fussing about my health!

I'm perfecta, I'm perfecta!

I'm just so worried about her
living in that house all by-

[Arguing in Spanish continues]

Basta!

Everyone, we will talk when
Jaylen gets home tomorrow.

Thank you, Hector.

That sounds like a great idea.

Oh, we are going
to talk, Jay Jay.

This is no laughing matter.

Okay, I love you,
thank you, bye!

You're gonna love them.

Mhm.

â™ª [Orchestral holiday
music continues] â™ª

Oh, I'm so excited
to be home, Margot.

â™ª

Wow, you are booked literally
until the end of time.


â™ª [Orchestral holiday
music continues] â™ª

Safety first.
Of course.

Thank you.
You are gonna be busy.

And Tyler, the choreographer,
is flying in to

work with you on Saturday.

As long as I'm done
at a decent hour.

You know my family will have
wall-to-wall Christmas plans.

I do.

Have we vetted this Tyler guy?

It's Tyler Huston.

Hello!

The lead host and judge of
World's Greatest Dancer.

That means nothing to me.

worry, he's vetted.

Where are we going?

Well, you made me burn my
cookies and I can't show up

empty-handed, so I'm gonna
pick some up for my family.


Cookies are gonna be the
last thing on their minds

when they meet
soldier boy over here.

What are you planning to
tell your family about me?

I was hoping they'd be too
mesmerized by my cookies

to notice you.


[Hushed chatter continues]

[Jaylen squeals softly & sighs]

Hey, how's your Spanish?

You wanna be my
long, lost cousin,

visiting for the holidays?

Ha, no.

The label is validating
my family's concerns

for my safety.
It's really unfair.

Hey, every celebrity
has security.

They don't see me
as a celebrity.

They'll be calling me Jay
Jay, La Cobaya until I'm 60.

Cobaya?

It's 'guinea pig'.

You know them, Margot,
they won't understand.

Once they get their minds
stuck on something...

It's true, since we were kids.

But it's gonna be fine,
it's gonna be fine.


â™ª [Orchestral holiday
music continues] â™ª

Hey, the car's here,
let's go! Come, come on!

â™ª

Papi!
Mi amor.

Okay! Mami, que guapa!

Mwah!

Abuela...
Oh!

goodness! Felicidades!

And brother.
Jay-Jay La Cobaya is home.

Hector, you can't
call me that anymore.

I'm a grown woman.

Oh, so now that
you're a superstar,

you're too fancy
to be La Cobaya?

[Abuela speaking Spanish]

She has been traveling
the whole day.

Feliz Navidad, mijita.
Feliz Navidad, a todo.

You've grown.
[Laughing]

Have you grown?!

Papi, you just saw me in LA.

But I know who has grown, Faith.

You are glowing!

Oh, please, I'm a
house, nothing fits.

And if I walk up three
steps, I need a nap.


It'll all be worth it when
this precious arrives because

I am going to spoil
him, her, them.

No, I don't think
so, it's a her.

I can feel the vibe,
and I'm never wrong.


Nobody asked you, Abuela.


Come inside out of the cold.

Margot, thank you for getting
her home to us safely.

Absolutely.
Will you come inside?

I would really love to,

I just haven't seen
my family in so long.

But I promise I will
be back very soon.

Will you be here for
the nativity tomorrow?

Oh, wouldn't miss it.

And, who might you be?

Si, Mija, who is this
handsome young man?

Are you with Margot?

Oh, no. [Laughing]

Oh, that's a funny
story. [Laughing]

Papi, Mami, Abuela...

This is Matt, my bo-Boyfriend.

Your boyfriend?!
Boyfriend?

You haven't said anything
about date or anything, ah...

since you broke up with Eddie.

Yep, surprise! [Laughing]

Margot, I will handle this.
You enjoy the holiday.

Really? You sure?
Mhm!

Alright! See you soon.

-I am not- -Actually,
come on in!

And let's get you settled,
and then you can tell us

absolutely everything
about yourself.


Bye, bye.
Okay.

[Car starting]

What are you doing?
Um...

You and I are an item now.

Now, ah, that's
not gonna happen.

Ah, yes, it is.

You need to work with
me 'cause you don't know

what you're settling in for.

Your family sure takes
Christmas seriously.

Buddy, you got no idea.

â™ª [Orchestral holiday
music ends dramatically] â™ª

I'm sorry. I panicked.

do this, I won't lie.

Everything has to
be on the level.

Level?
Mija! [Laughing]

Come visit for a moment.
Okay.

And then, you can go unpack.

Okay, mhm.
Vamos.

Vamos, vamanos. Como estas?


[Indistinct
conversation & laughing]

[Conversation in Spanish]

This door doesn't have a lock.

Yes, it broke, and I never
got around to fixing it.

Actually, we don't
lock any of the doors.

There's no need.

That's a mistake.

â™ª [Pensive orchestral
music continues] â™ª

Matt, please take your coat off.

Come in and tell us
what it is you do.

He's a contractor.

Yeah, my boyfriend, he's
always looking at...

houses and structures and...

Doors.
[Laughing]

So, where are you from, Matt?

Ah, Cleveland!

You know what, it's
been a long day.

We should go unpack,
and we will have

plenty of time to
visit at dinner, right?

Get to know each other.

Yes, well, let's
get the room set up.

Okay.

Separate rooms.

Aye, amor, por favor.

Matt, let's get you
out of here, yeah.

â™ª

[Matt whispers] So nice.

get the room ready.

Cleveland, really?

Yeah, where are you from?

Simi Valley.

Yeah, I probably
should've asked.

Jaylen, I won't lie.

We're not really lying, we're...

Fabricating a backstory.

So, lying.
For less than a week!

We have a fun Christmas
with my family and then

we go our separate ways.

Not necessarily.

I leave when the label says.

You're a rule
follower, aren't you?

Yeah, that's what we do.

And what does that mean?

I was a Navy Seal.

You can never let
your guard down.

I mean, what happens if you do?

I don't know, it's
never happened.

Well, that sounds exhausting.

â™ª

So, where's my room?


Right this way, sir.

Thank you.
Mi casa, su casa.

â™ª [Whimsical orchestral
music continues] â™ª

So, why aren't you
a Navy Seal anymore?

I got injured during drills.

Honorable discharge.

And the next logical step for
you was babysitting pop stars?

Ha... you know,

a simple thank you for keeping
you safe would suffice.

Thank you, but I didn't
ask for any of this.

Oh, trust me, neither did I.

I, I hope this works for you.

If we'd known you were coming,

we'd have been more prepared.

Comfy cozy.

Give it a try.

Oh, no, it's fine.
I insist.

Okay.



Oh!
Ah...

You take my room,
I'll sleep here.

No, no, no. No,
this is... perfect.

We need your help tomorrow
with the Nacimiento.

You got here just in time.

Living nativity.

We do it in our front
yard, neighbors come out.

Oh, yeah? All the
neighbors are coming out?

Ah, no, just some.
No, got it.

So, how many
neighbors are there?

Do you, do you know them all?

Yes! It's such a
friendly community.

And we're going to
introduce you to

all of our traditions, Matt.

Yeah, and you can share all
your family traditions, too.

Listen, I'm just
here to make sure-

Enjoy Christmas!

And not have any stress
before the tour, yeah, me too.

You get settled, and we'll
see you downstairs for dinner.

Abuela made champorado
just for your return!

Oh, gracias, Abuela!

Que rico!

Champorado, it's Indigenous
Mexican hot chocolate.

I'm so sorry.

â™ª [Orchestral music
ends dramatically] â™ª

I'm not asking you
to do this for me.

Think of that sweet, old lady.

Do you want to be the one
to kill her with worry?

Because I don't.

You artistic types
definitely have a flair

for the dramatic, don't you?

That lady looks
healthier than any of us.

They didn't want me to go to
LA, or audition for the show.

I would think not, after what
happened to Cousin Jorge.

They told you about that?

I overheard the
phone conversation.

You don't miss a thing, do you?

I'm paid not to miss a thing.

Well, if my parents, my
family had it their way,

I would be off at
Hannigan's every Thursday

singing karaoke, like Lorelei.

Who is Lorelei?


An old friend.

She beat me out for every
role in the school play.

She was Belle, I was the fork.

She was-[Singing] Maria.

And I was the Von Trapp boy.

She was Annie,
and I was the dog.

We both worked at
the local newspaper,

and we saw that the
network put out an ad to

have auditions, so we
decided to go together.

I won, and Lorelei got
cut after round two.

[Sighing]
Where is she now?

Singing karaoke at
Hannigan's every Thursday!

I thought you could keep up.

[Scoffing]
Sorry.

â™ª [Somber music continues] â™ª

When she came back,
she told everyone that

LA was a crime
-ridden cesspool.

And it only added fuel
to my family's fire.



[Bed creaking]
[Sighing]

You're right, this is
ridiculous, I'll...

I'll get some blankets
for more cushion.

Or, I won't...

until you go along with this.

Look, I'm gonna do
this because I want to

keep the label happy.

But the moment it
becomes unsafe-

if it becomes unsafe-
we come clean, okay?

This is not a game, Jaylen.

I can see that.

Now get ready, it's Thursday
and the rest of the gang's

at Hannigan's and we're
gonna see them, come on!

It's gonna be fun,
karaoke, Christmas!

Woohoo!
[Sighing] Okay.

â™ª ["O Christmas
Tree" instrumental] â™ª

Oh, I'll get us a table.

Okay, thank you.


Hey, you made it!

Faith didn't want to come?

No, she said, "This baby
is kicking, go without me."

Well, more like she
yelled it at me.

well, hey, I know

it must be hard for her,
so thank you for coming.

Of course.

â™ª ["O Christmas Tree"
instrumental continues] â™ª

[Clearing throat]

What, what are you doing?

This is what couples do.

No, I am not crossing
any lines with you, okay.

It's unprofessional.

It's a hand, not a
marriage proposal.

Work with me here.

Thank you. Now come on, honey.

This way, guys.
Oh, cool.

Oh, yes, of course!
Here you go!

There you are. [Laughing]

I can't believe it,
the Jaylen Rodriguez,

here in Hannigan's?

It's like, "Ah!"
I know, right?

Oh, Char, I'm your old
friend, who fell off

the pyramid and broke your
collar bone at Cheer finals.

It's just, you're so famous.

I'm still me, Char, right?


Does she know yet?
Know what?

Yeah, I just found out
you have been chosen to

be the Grand
Marshall, this year,

at the Christmas
Eve tree lighting?

Me?
Mhm.

Oh, wow!

They're really particular
about who does that.

You're kind of a big deal.

Well, I'm barely getting
used to the fact that

people care I exist.

I mean, well, besides my family.


Tree lighting?
Oh, huge honor.

Everyone comes to the town
square for the lighting.

Are you sure it's a
good idea, you know,

to be so... exposed?

â™ª [Holiday music
continues in background] â™ª

I mean, to the cold, you know,

just before you go on tour.

We'll have hand warmers.

And hot water,
lemon, it'll be fine.

Everyone ready?
Yeah!

Got us a table.
Okay.

You will never guess
who I bumped into.

It's Lorelei! Tah-dah!

[Anxious laugh] Hey...

You alright?
Yeah.

[Indistinct chatter
in background]

[Inaudible conversation]

Hey!
Hey.

Hi.

It's great to see
you live in person.

It's a, it's usually on my TV.

Yeah, it's great to be
home. I've missed everyone.

And you, who might you be?

Oh, right. [Laughing]

This is my boyfriend,
Matt Lucas.


Lowis.


It's an inside joke.

Big Star Wars fan right here
so, that's what I call him.

Huge... huge.

You know, Jaylen, Eddie's
home for Christmas, too.

Eddie's Jaylen's ex.

They were supposed to
move to LA together,

but I guess they both moved on.

Yeah! It'll be good
to see him too.

To see everyone.

So, how did you and Jaylen meet?

Yes, tell us how an ordinary
Joe such as yourself

lands a superstar
like my baby sister.


Well, that's a funny
story actually.

You want to tell it, babe?

No.


You little prankster.

I introduced them.
That's not funny.

Oh, you have not heard
the whole story yet.


So, Matt-[Clearing throat]-

and I met on a dating app.

And, he was so not my
type, I was not feeling it.

Um, he, he...

hates the Cowboys.

And, does not recycle.

So, I said, "You should
meet my best friend 'cause

she would love you," and he did.

And she did, and...

they did, and...

Here we are!


Why don't you recycle?

Do you hate the earth?

You know what, how, how
come no one is singing?

You know, is it not
karaoke night anymore?

Jay, you and Lorelei
should do a sing-off,

just like old times.

Lorelei, that would
be fun, right?

No, I don't want to
do duets anymore.

Come on, Lorelila...

you and I used to
bring the house down.

So many great memories!
Okay...

Okay, okay!
[Cheering]

Sing off, sing off, sing off!


[Indistinct speaking]


[Cheering & applauding]


What do you say to
Christmas Medley #8?

You sure you're up for #8?

It's been a while.
I got the muscle memory.

I could do 8, 9,
10, you name it.

Okay, #8, it is.
Okay.

I'll take the first part,
you take the second?

Oh, God, I live for
the second part.

Hit it!

â™ª WHOA-OH-OH-AH! â™ª

[Cheering & applauding]

[Shattering glass]

Exit, back door, now!
What? Wait!

It's nothing!

â™ª [Orchestral] â™ª

What is he doing?

Stop! What is the
matter with you?

Look, I'm just here to keep
you safe from any threats.

That was a broken glass!

There are no threats!

I'm doing my job, alright,
which apparently entails

performing for your
family and your friends.

So, how about just
a little gratitude?

I appreciate you for
going along with this.

But my career is taking off
way more than I expected.

And I just want a normal
Christmas with my family,

which you are coming
dangerously close to ruining,

so why don't you try
to get into the spirit,

or I'll find someone
else who will.

Yeah, we'll call the
label in the morning,

and we'll get them
to send someone...

who likes...

ugly Christmas sweaters.

Who thinks eggnog
is a food group.

Or maybe someone who has
an improve background!

Good!
Great!

Hey...

Is... everything okay here?

â™ª

Heard you were here.

News travels at the speed
of light in this town.

Hey, I'm Eddie.

Matt.

I'm Jaylen's...

Boyfriend.

Jaylen doesn't have a boyfriend.

And how would you know that?

Well, you know, entertainment
news, social media.

Oh, yeah, are you
checking up on her?


Sounds like you figured
out the way to her heart.

Bringing someone home for a
Rodriguez family Christmas...

[Exhaling sharply]
Sounds pretty serious.

See you at Nacimiento.

â™ª [Gentle guitar
music continues] â™ª

Hey...

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine, I just
had enough of this

trip down memory
lane for the night.

[Clearing throat]

I want to go home.

Okay, good.

Finally something
we can agree on.

â™ª [Gentle orchestral music] â™ª

â™ª [Gentle piano
music continues] â™ª

Don't you want to know what
that was about, back there?

I don't like to get
emotionally involved

in my client's lives.

You don't like me
very much, do you?

It doesn't matter
what I think, alright.

It matters what I do.

However, you're not
my first pop star,

and you probably
won't be my last.

Well, I'm not who
you think I am.

That whole sweetheart
image on the show...

I don't think anything, alright,

and I don't judge,
and I don't assume.

I'm just here to protect you.

Any personal information
is just given on

a "need to know"
basis, you know.

Okay, so, what do
you need to know?

â™ª [Gentle orchestral
music continues] â™ª

Well, I need to know
where you're going and

what you're doing.
End of list.

Needed to know,

you're leaving after
tomorrow, remember?

Or maybe you're just
saying that 'cause...

you miss your family
this Christmas instead of

having to be forced
to be with mine.

No, that's, that's not it.

I, I don't have that...

what you have.

So, what would you be
doing if you weren't here?

I don't know, ah, watching...

watching a movie,
eating Chinese food.

Reading a book.
All by yourself?

Well, I can't have that.

No, not when there's
a perfectly perfect

Rodriguez family Christmas,
yours for the taking.

You can't replace me
and keep up your lie.

That's why you want me to
stay for your perfectly

perfect Rodriguez Christmas, hm?

Hm, nothing gets past you.

Not much.

No, really, we
have a great time.

And so would you if you would
stop being a stickler and

enjoyed yourself
for five minutes.

Alright. [Clearing throat]

I'll stay. But only
because I don't want the

record company to
think I can't hack it.

Not because, you
know, I want to...

sit by the fire and
sing "Jingle Bells".

Ha... Don't worry...

We don't do that anymore.

â™ª [Gentle piano
music continues] â™ª

Hey, can I just say,

thank you for going
along with this?

For going along with what, Mija?

Sleeping on the
sofa bed, Abuela.

Not ideal.

No, no, lo siento, Matt,
but if we had known

you were coming, we would
have been more prepared.

It's perfect, thank you.

Hasta luego.
[Laughing]

Buenas noches.
Buenas noches.

â™ª [Whimsical instrumental
music continues] â™ª

Oh, I like him.
Oh?

Oh! [Laughing]

Muy bien muchacho.

He's a good person.

I can feel it right in my heart.

And I'm never wrong.
Oh, no?

No, never.

â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music continues] â™ª


Oh, I hope I didn't wake you.

I was trying to be quiet, but...

I just couldn't skip a day.

It's a routine! [Panting]


Hey, you want to join me?

Maybe after I get some coffee.

Okay.
[Groaning]

Hill climb, Lance Armstrong!


[Conversation in Spanish]

Abuela!
Ah!

Hola.

I hope Joaquin didn't wake you.

His routine, he thinks
he's going to be Iron Man.

Oh, yeah...
[Laughing]

No, it's, it's fine.

So, what's going on here?

Oh, prep for the
living nativity.

I think this is
going to fit fine.

Ah, yes, we decided...

you're going to be a wise man.

Arm in.
A, a what?

Yeah, bring it in. Let's
see, here, arm here.

Let's not rip this fine
work Mommy has done.

And what do we think?
Oh, it's your color!

[Laughing & clapping]

Wow.
[Laughing]

Okay, this is...
It looks good.

Is this one of the
Christmas traditions

I'm supposed to be embracing?

It is. Por supuesto.

But don't worry, all you
have to do is hold some

frankincense and follow
along with the rest, right?

Exactamente. [Laughing]

Okay, and you are... Mary?

Great guess, but no,

this year I've been
replaced by Faith.

And that's what we
call typecasting.


Got it.
Show biz.

Ah, can I chat with
you for a second?

Yeah, sure.
Okay.


I have to walk down
to the town square.

And check out in
daylight exactly how much

you're gonna be
exposed on stage.

Exposed?
Yeah, so...

Just stay with your
family while I'm gone.

And, look at me-
don't leave the house.

I won't go anywhere.

I will be at the
house making sure that

your costume fits, okay?

How's that sound?
That's great news.

See you in a bit.
Okay.

Okay.

[Fans squealing &
shouting] Jaylen! Jaylen!

go get Jaylen?!

Hi! Can you get Jaylen?

Come back tonight
for Nacimiento.

She'll take a selfie
with you. Now go home!

Go, get out of here!

You too, man, get out of here!

â™ª [Suspenseful
orchestral music] â™ª

New Orleans, all sold out.

Stop it! Already?

It is all happening,
take this in.

This is your time.

You're right, and
I am, Benny, but-

I don't want to sound
ungrateful here,

but you know I want
to perform as me.

My songs, my voice.

English and Spanish, remember?

And you will, eventually,
but for right now,

I want you to enjoy Christmas,

and you let me take
care of the rest, okay?

Eyes on the prize.

We're going to
Miami! [Laughing]

Feliz Navidad, Benny.

Merry Christmas to you!


Matt?


Come on, Matt, it's time.

I can't wear this.

Come on, I'm not
gonna laugh at you.

I'm coming...

â™ª [Playful instrumental
music continues] â™ª

Okay, maybe I'm
gonna laugh a little,

but only 'cause
you look so good.

Alright, don't you patronize me.

I look ridiculous!
It's gonna be fine.

This is the weirdest
assignment I've ever had.

Now remind me again why
I agreed to do this?

'Cause you're
getting paid, ding!

Not nearly enough.

Well, then, I'll put in a good
word with the label, okay?

Now come on, Frankincense,
it's show time.

Hm...
[Laughing]

Hm, looking so good!
Okay...

Can you, ah, come help
me carry some groceries

from my truck?

Sure.



I got these.

â™ª [Whimsical instrumental
music continues] â™ª

â™ª [Sinister instrumental
music continues] â™ª

Another one.

â™ª [Sinister instrumental
music continues] â™ª

Same handwriting.

I found one of these notes
at the bar last night.

Also unsigned.

This one was on the porch today,

but I figured it was from
one of the lookie-loo's

camped out outside.

No, I don't think so.

You think it's something
to worry about?

No, no, I...

It's probably just
fan mail, you know.

That's the gig,
she's a big star now.


Not sure I'll ever
get used to that.

But I don't think we should
tell her about the notes.

I don't want to
worry her or Abuela.

No, this is just
between you and me.

Okay? I promise you, Hector,

nothing's gonna happen to her.

Not on my watch, okay?

Now that's the attitude
I was looking for.

Yeah?

And the wise men
came from the East,

followed by the star that
led them to Bethlehem.

To the manger.

[Speaking Spanish]

We are the three wise men.

And we come bearing
gifts for the baby Jesus.

â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music continues] â™ª

And we come bearing gifts...

Oh, oh, yeah. Got
something for ya.


Ah!

Faith, you can stop, the
baby Jesus was born already.


Is it happening again?
Is what happening?

Worse than before?

She was having contractions
the other night,

but they said they
were Braxton Hicks,

and sent us home.
Do we go back?

Do we wait? Do we stay?

Do we go?
Ah!

[Speaking Spanish]

[Crowd chatter]

Okay, you take her
to the hospital.

I don't think you want
to have a baby in a

cold manger, this day
and age, would you?

[Laughing]
No.

have let you play Mary,

after... all!

I'm sorry, folks,
the show is over.

Thankfully, the baby
Jesus has arrived,

so let us celebrate
this baby while we await

the arrival of our grand-baby!

Yeah!
Please, come join us.

I'll be in touch as soon
as we know what's going on.

We're praying, Mijo.

[Speaking Spanish]

I'm gonna be a tia!

Really nice wings you had there.


[Clearing throat] So
sorry to interrupt.

I just got a text. Tyler
Huston just arrived.

We're gonna start rehearsing
the opening number tomorrow.

Ah, that's the tamalada.

I can't miss that,
Abuela would kill me.

Ah, what is a tamalada?

And, where is this
rehearsal taking place?

I gotta, gotta check
out the space first.

not the president, Matt.

And I'm sure the
studio is clean.

And a tamalada is
a very important

Christmas tradition
in my culture.

You know what, we can
rehearse from 9 to 12.

Okay.
Oh...

And the label sent
over the new songs.

Uh-huh?
They're... good-ish.


So, I'm just a
manufactured pop star with

no discernible
personality, got it.

No, don't think
anyone believes that.

[Phone ringing]

Oh, sorry, I gotta take this.

Okay.


Hey, you have a minute?

I've been following
your career on social.

Nice mini mansion, by the way.

It sure beats Squirrel Hollow.

Hey, how do you know
she has a mini mansion?

Dude, can we have a minute?

Yeah, sure, go ahead.

Look, I've been
meaning to reach out,

but I didn't know
what to say, Jay.

I do know why you didn't
want me to come to LA though.

All I wanted was for you
to show up, and you didn't.

That wasn't gonna change

just because our address did.

I know.

Look, I wasn't very
good with the love,

and the flowers, and
the poetry thing,

but I'm trying to be better.

Be better how? By writing
notes or something?

Come on, man. Look,
I know I'm too late,

and I regret what
happened to us.

But you and I work
together, Jay.

I mean it.

[Music & chatter in background]

Tonight's about family, Eddie.

But, thank you.

Thank you for coming.

Alright, okay.

Have a good night.

â™ª [Guitar instrumental] â™ª

It's a girl!

Her name is Luisa, after Abuela!

Ah! [Laughing]

[Speaking Spanish]

Vamos al hospital!
Vamos!

I feel so honored!

[Laughing]
Felicidades!

[Speaking Spanish]

Another reason for
you to come home.

Yeah.
Your first niece.

Then, you can watch her grow up.

A family needs to
stick together.

Mhm, yeah.

I'm gonna be coming
back as much as I can.

It won't be enough.

I don't see why you
can't be here and there.

Because I'll be on tour.

I'll be multi-coastal.

So, it's important to enjoy
the here and now, Abuelita.

Of course, of course.

Well, buenas noches.


Good night... good night!

Feliz Navidad. [Laughing]

Feliz Navidad.


Vamos, be back.

[Speaking Spanish]

â™ª [Gentle piano] â™ª


Wow.
[Laughing]

I know this girl. [Laughing]

I really see, you love all this.

This is how we connect
with each other, you know?

Through music, and
cultural traditions, and...

Ah, we get to tell stories
and make memories that

we're gonna be
laughing at forever.

Come on, you have to
have enjoyed it a little.

Ah...

yeah, I, you know, I
prefer to be a spectator.

You were a phenomenal wise man.

Ah, okay, phenomenal
is a stretch.

Really, ah...

it was more exceptional.


Okay, so you're funny sometimes.

Sure, maybe.
[Laughing]

I know, my family's
not perfect and,

no one's is, and...

Ultimately, when you find the
people that let you be you...

So, why don't they let
you be you in your career?

Well, sometimes family and...

record label, and the
public, even, they...

they think they can
decide who you are.

And, you have to live up
to their expectations.

So, I do as I'm told.

Yeah.

Look, let me say this.

In the Navy, when
we wanted to...

accomplish a task...

we would...

plot, plan...

and execute.

I, personally, wouldn't
outsource something

important as, say,

trying to get an
executive at a label to

listen to my songs.

No.

No, you, you
wouldn't, you would...

plot, plan, and execute, right?

And, you're stuck with me and,

hey, you wouldn't want
me to tell the label that

you couldn't execute it.


Okay.


I'm here.

But...

you are not getting
me in another costume.

Come on, you're warming up!

[Groaning]
[Laughing]

â™ª [Energetic orchestral
music continues] â™ª

5, 6, 7, 8!

And here's the best
part, you're singing,

you're singing your heart out,

the fan's on warp speed,
the cape you're wearing is

blowing through the wind.

Your hair is whipping
around, "ch-ch".

And, ha! [Panting]

You're a goddess.

You're a Greek goddess.

Then the other dancers come
in, and here is the lift.

The goddess is lifted
up, up in the air,

her arms are open, taking
in all the adoration-

Yeah, that, that's great,
but it's not gonna work.

It needs to be me. You
know, I'm a Rodriguez.

I want to represent
for mi gente.

Your people.

Let, let me speak your language.

Okay.
Cumbias.

Cumbia, si.
Si, salsa.

Ah, da...

Eh, eh! Or some...

Yes, okay, oh, okay, okay, okay.

-Okay, let me find a song-
-You know, something just, ah!

And, let's see that.

Yes, yes!
Yes!

Ah! [Laughing]

Uh-huh. There we
go, there we go.

Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Oh, so you know some of this?


â™ª [Upbeat Latin
music continues] â™ª

Ah, yes! Yes!

Eh!
Yes!

Ha!
Yes, thank you!

Isn't that fun?
I love it.

It's great!

Big guy, why don't
you come over here?

What? What?

I want to see something,
help me out here, come on.


Stand right over here, okay.

Follow me.

Right hand up, your
left hand's gonna grab

onto her hand, there
we go. You're gonna-

Like, this?
Yeah, like that.

Oh... okay. Cool.

So, I'm gonna count
you guys down,

and you're gonna
move your body...

into his body, and
you're gonna pull her in.

Ready? 5, 6, 7, 8.

Oh, ah!

Don't worry, I gotcha.

I know.
[Laughing]

Woo!
Hey!


So, you do know some of this.

[Laughing]
Yes!

I think Christina Aguilera
did that act 20 years ago...

Not very modern.

But, in the vein of
plot, plan, and execute,

I've come up with an idea.

I don't need to wait on Benny.

I can email the
songs over, myself.

I like it.
Yeah?

Yeah.

You know, another thing I
learned in the military...

loudest voice usually wins.

Hm?

That guy.

â™ª [Somber instrumental
music continues] â™ª

What, you know him?

He showed up at my
house back in LA.

I can't believe he
followed me here.

He's relentless.

Yeah, paparazzi
always are, come on.

â™ª [Gentle instrumental] â™ª

For those of you who've
never done tamalada-

Matt-tamalada is a
Mexican holiday tradition,

and everyone has a role.

Matt and Jaylen, you are
the corn husk handlers.

You remove them from
the water and dry them.

Joaquin and Camila,

you spread the
masa on the husk...

evenly!

Mm, then hand them to me.

I put the filling,
fold and steam.

Is everyone clear on their role?

Si jefa.
[Laughing]

Perfecto. Now...

We have hundreds
to make. [Laughing]

Hundreds? Is she serious?


I do not joke when it
comes to tamaladas.

This is for the neighbors.

And this year is going
to be as good as ever.


[Speaking Spanish] [Laughing]

â™ª FELIZ NAVIDAD â™ª

â™ª [echoing] Feliz Navidad... â™ª

â™ª FELIZ NAVIDAD â™ª

â™ª [echoing] Feliz Navidad... â™ª

â™ª FELIZ NAVIDAD â™ª

â™ª PROSPERO ANO Y FELICIDAD. â™ª

â™ª [echoing] Y Felicidad â™ª

â™ª I WANNA WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS! â™ª

â™ª I WANNA WISH YOU A
MERRY CHRISTMAS... â™ª

â™ª I WANNA WISH YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS â™ª

â™ª FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY HEART! â™ª

Oh, wow!
[Laughing]

[Inaudible speaking]

[Music fades away]

You're a dad now, Hec.

I know, I can hardly believe it.

And she's perfect, Jay.
I can't wait to meet her.

Another day or so she'll
be out of the NICU and

can have visitors.

And then, maybe, you and
Faith can think about

getting your own place.

You think MamÃ¡ and Papi
and Abuela are gonna let us

move now that there's
a baby in the mix?

Okay, fair point. [Laughing]

Plus, you can't beat
built-in babysitting.

Also true.
[Laughing]

Are you happy?
Most of the time.

I'm happy right now.

See? Everything is better
when we're all together.

Or maybe, it's because of Matt.

I don't know...

Maybe...

know, you think so?


â™ª [Gentle guitar
music continues] â™ª

came down to sneak one in.

Don't, don't tell on me?


Welcome to the cone
of tamal silence.

Mhm.
[Laughing]

Alright, I have to get
back to the hospital.

Faith is expecting these
tamales to be there

when she wakes up.

Send her our love, and please...

Send besitos to baby Luisa.
Okay.

Buenas noches, brother.

Te llamo.
Te llamo.

See you.
See you, man.

So, what do you do, when
you plot, plan and execute,

and all you get from the
label is an auto-reply that

the label, "doesn't accept
unsolicited material"?

They didn't even know it was
from one of their artists.

Hm...

Well, I would say, in...

in combat, never give up.

This is hardly combat.

You know, in the Navy,
we have a saying.

Semper Fortis.

"Always courageous."

And that's the kind of person
that I want to be, Matt.

You know, someone who
isn't afraid to go

against the grain, but...

I feel like everyone is
trying to hold me back.

â™ª [Gentle piano
music continues] â™ª

You know, we...

shouldn't make ourselves small

so that people will
feel comfortable.

Just be bold.

Be brave, be courageous.

Semper Fortis, hm?

Why is it that...

I can stand up to you, but I...

everyone else, I just...

let them call the
shots, no arguments?

Well, because I'm on the job.

You know, my...

My role in your life
has an end date.

I don't think my family
would let that happen.

You're a Rodriguez now
whether you like it or not.

You know, I kind of
like the sound of that.

You seemed to have a
lot of fun last night.

Oh, I did.

I could bathe in
Abuela's tamales.


How did I not know that
this is a Christmas thing?

Oh, well, you've never dated
a Mexican-American girl.

Well, fake dated a
Mexican-American girl.

But you're definitely
getting a taste of

what it's like in our world.

You know, I know your family
makes you crazy, Jaylen,

but...

You're lucky.


â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music continues] â™ª

I must sound so ungrateful
to you, Matt, I'm so sorry.

No, no, no, no, it's okay.

I'm, I'm fine being on my own.

You know, we, we
do what we know.

â™ª

But I can also see that
box you've been put in.

And I don't think
that's fair to you.

Yet I do what's expected of me.

Yeah, but you didn't do
that at the audition.

And you won.

What was different then?

â™ª

I don't think any of us
thought I was gonna win.

Not that they didn't
believe in me, but...

The odds weren't in my favor.

The only person who
thought I had a shot was...

Lorelei.

It was how she convinced
me to go with her.

Wow, you went
because of Lorelei?

She gave me the
confidence to join her.

And my life hasn't
been the same since.

You can do it again.

With your family, with
the label, right now.

Plot, plan, execute.

No fear.
Semper Fortis.


Yes!
[Laughing]

That's my girl.
Thank you.

â™ª [Piano] â™ª

â™ª OH, HOLY NIGHT. â™ª

â™ª THE STARS ARE
BRIGHTLY SHINING. â™ª

â™ª NACIO JESUS, â™ª

â™ª NUESTO GRAN SALVADOR. â™ª


I miss singing with you, Mija.

Here at the piano.

In church.

I know, I do too.

You know...

When I was a girl...

I wanted to be a
singer, just like you.

Then, I met Abuelo.

Abuela, you would
have been amazing!

No, it was a very
short time in my life.

There weren't enough
opportunities for girls

like me, my age, in
Mexico, or anywhere else.

People will like to take
advantage of the young

and naive, who were
looking for a better life.

Abuela, I can't imagine
you ever being naive.

Ah, well, that is because my
papi told it to me straight.

And you, you taught me.

So, you don't have
to worry about me.

[Speaking Spanish]

My love of music comes from you.

But sometimes, we
have to leave home,

to find greatness.

Like you and Abuelo
did, you know?

But knowing you are
out there, all alone.

I am not all alone,
okay? I have-

Matt, I know, of course.

I'm happy you found him.

Yeah, I feel like...

Like Matt really sees me.

Mi papa, used to say...

"Find a man who will
jump in front of

a moving train to save you."

I found that in Abuelo.

You and Abuelo had
a love for the ages.

Ah, I'm not sure how
Matt feels about me.

It's very clear he will jump
in front of a train for you!

There's a reason
for that. [Laughing]

That's because my boyfriend
is totally a good guy.

But he...

He has some walls up.

Some hearts are harder
to reach than others.

But I believe his
already belongs to you.

â™ª [Gentle guitar

[Music ends]

â™ª [Somber instrumental
music continues] â™ª

Hey.
Hi.

I just came home to
get Faith's book,

and I found this.

Why is this person
going to so much trouble

to not sign these?

I don't know, Hector.

But this is her life now.

And I won't let anyone
get near her, okay.

Hm, I'm sad to miss
Luminarias tonight.

But, as long as Faith and
the baby are in the hospital,

I'll stay there with them.

Understood.

Hey, what is Luminarias, anyway?

You'll see.

That is this family's
answer to everything.

Yes, it is.

â™ª [Gentle guitar
music continues] â™ª

So, what do you think
of Squirrel Hollow?

I think this town and your
family are wonderful, but...

I think the sooner we get out
of here and go back to LA,

the better.

What happens when we get back?

I don't know, I guess
that's up to the label.

So, your assignment's done
and you never see me again,

is that what you're saying?

No, no, that's not what I said.

Do you want to keep seeing me?

Ah, do you?

Don't deflect, I
asked you first.

Listen, I'm not,
I'm not deflecting.

Just...

I don't think it'd
be professional

for me to answer that.

Oh, come on, this
hasn't been professional

since you put on a
wise man costume.

That was pretty
much forced on me.

You don't have to
pretend with me.

Jaylen, I'm not... [Laughing]

That's all I've been doing,
all day and all night,

is just pretending in
front of your family.

Then stop pretending, and
tell me what you're thinking.

â™ª [Gentle instrumental] â™ª

I'm thinking...

What? Say it.

Why aren't you saying anything?

â™ª

â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music swells] â™ª

Okay, I got that loud and clear.

Good. [Laughing]

Ah...

Let's go get some pies, huh?

Yeah, let's do that.


â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music continues] â™ª

We place luminarias
along the walkway,

as they were thought
to be a guide to help

Mary and Joseph
find their way home.

And then, we make a wish.

Abuelo believed
that as they burn,

they put our wishes out
into the sky, and then...

they come true.

One of my last luminarias
was right before I left

for the LA audition so,

you want to think
long and hard about

what you're putting out there.

I don't have to think about it.

I already have mine.

For Hector, and
Faith, and the baby.

It's up to the fates.

No, Papi.

It's up to us.

I know what to do.

I have a plot to
plan and execute.

It's gonna work just fine.

Vamos!

Whatever it is, count me in.

Yeah?
Yeah.


Thank you.

â™ª [Whimsical instrumental
music continues] â™ª

and gentlemen...

Ladies and gentlemen,

if I can have your attention.
We're ready to begin.

We're all set. Two
press outlets are here.

This is a great idea,
Jay. And it's gonna work.

Welcome to Squirrel Hollow's
tree lighting ceremony.

We are so happy to
have you here tonight.

And a special thank you to
Straight Talk wireless for

generously sponsoring
this event,

as well as Jaylen's
upcoming tour.

Now, I have some airtime
cards that I will be

passing out a little later,
also courtesy of Straight Talk.

And, it is my...

honor, on behalf of this town,

to welcome up our
Grand Marshall...

Jaylen Rodriguez, let's
light this tree, yeah!

[Cheering & applauding]

Thank you so much for
entrusting me with

this honor, and letting
me be a part of this,

in the place where...

I can always be me.

And I wouldn't be
where I am today

if it weren't for one person,

who needs to help me
light this Christmas tree.

Lorelei?

In life, you are lucky
if you have one friend

who believes in you.

And for me, that was Lorelei.

I never thanked you
for your encouragement.

For getting me on that bus.

And I should've.

Will you light
this tree with me?

Yeah.
Yeah?

Yes!
Let's do this!

Ready?
You.

Alright, okay.

[Cheering & applauding]

You have a song that
is- and I quote-

"The real Jaylen Rodriguez"?

Woo!
Ow!

Is that rumor true?
That's right!

We all have to be who we are,

and you all are going to get
a taste of the authentic me.

[Cheering & applauding]

â™ª [Piano] "We Wish You
A Merry Christmas" â™ª

â™ª WE WISH YOU A
MERRY CHRISTMAS. â™ª

â™ª WE WISH YOU... â™ª

Eh, mi gente!

â™ª BAILA CONMIGO! â™ª


[Cheering & applauding]

Jaylen!
[Cheering]

Jaylen!
Hey, what are you grabbing?

What were you reaching for, huh?

-What- -It was a poem!


Probably a bad one,

but she likes that sort
of thing, so I tried.

Look, sorry, sorry,
everyone, false alarm!

Continue on. Feliz Navidad!

Merry Christmas!

[Cheering & applauding]

So it was you?

Why didn't you sign it?

'Cause you were always there.

I didn't want you
coming after me.

She knows my handwriting.

Though, clearly, they
all got intercepted

'cause she never responded.

Sorry, man. Just...

Yeah.
Do you mind?

No.

Jaylen...

Great show.

Honestly.
Thank you, Eddie.

Bye.

[Crowd chatter in
the background]

â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music continues] â™ª

We did it.
That was really nice.


â™ª [Uplifting instrumental
music continues] â™ª

Excuse me, excuse me,
so sorry to interrupt.

Uh-huh?
It's Benny.

He sounds upset.

â™ª

Jay, what did you do?

I didn't want to
tell you because

I knew you would
talk me out of it.

Yeah, you know what, I would
have talked you out of it

because it was crazy. But
you know what, it worked.

What are you saying?

I am talking about, Barb
called me and asked me

why you're not singing songs
in English and Spanish.

They really didn't listen
to my music, did they?

have pushed harder.

I didn't do my job
right, and you did my job

better than I do my job.

And you know what, I
really don't like that,

but I'm very, very proud of you.

It's blowing up all
over the internet.

Yeah, Barb and her team
are gonna be listening

to your songs on Monday.

That's great news, Benny.

Well, you did this,
you made this happen!

I've been doing this job
for, what, for 20 years,

but I guess there's a
few things I still have

to learn how to do, you know.

[Children shouting]
Hey, Daddy's on the phone!

Stop screaming!

Why do people scream
in this house, Jay?

Merry Christmas, Benny.

Merry Christmas, Jay, I'll
see you when you get back.


â™ª [Uplifting instrumental
music continues] â™ª

The label loved it.

Ah!
We did it!

I knew it, I knew it.
Thank you!

I knew it.

What happened?
We did it, we did it!

[Screaming & laughing]

[Indistinct speaking]

So proud of you.
Thank you!

[Family chatter]

There's the superstar!

Hector! Sneaking around
like Santa Claus.

Presents for
everyone, from Luisa.

Aw!

Passed out on her
mama right now,

like a Christmas miracle.

Oh, I can't wait to
see what she got me.

I hope it's a blender,
a new blender.


What about chocolate caliente?

[Speaking Spanish]

Si, por favor!
I'm gonna get some of that.

Jay, Camila!

You missed all the excitement.

I know, I saw it,
yo, Jay was amazing.

Everybody's talking about it.

She went back to her roots.

I'm talking about what
happened off camera.

Another?

What does that make, like four?

It was Eddie.


At least we know she's
not in danger anymore.

Was I in danger?

â™ª [Somber instrumental] â™ª

I was getting notes and
you two didn't think

I should know about it?

Don't be mad at
him. It was my idea.

We, we didn't want to worry you.

Worry her about what?

Apparently, I was
receiving letters,

which was concerning to them.

Why wouldn't you say something?

We could have
called the Sheriff.

No, it was nothing
like that, MamÃ¡.

What? You didn't think
I could handle it?

You thought I wasn't
strong enough?

You thought I would crumble?

You're just like the
rest of them, Matt.

Zero faith in me, whatsoever.

Jaylen...
No, it's not true.

We have all the
faith in you, Mija.

We just worry.

We can love each other and
let go at the same time...

We have to give each
other the space to grow.

I was fine before
you came along.

And I didn't need you then
and I don't need you now.

That is not a good
way to talk to

your boyfriend, Jay.

He's not my boyfriend, Papi!

Matt and I aren't a couple.

He's a bodyguard, hired
by the record company.

And I didn't want to tell
you all anything because

I didn't want it to
be more than it was.

â™ª

So, Matt, nothing...?

None of this was true?

â™ª

Everything I told you was real.

â™ª

Why would you lie to us, Jay?

Because I'm doing what I love.

But all I hear is,

"Come home where we
can protect you."

But you need to trust that
I know what's best for me.

And that I need to live for me.

No, no...

Maybe we did go too
far with our worry.

But, what about,
what about the lying?

And the whole elaborate charade?

That is not who we are, Jaylen.

â™ª [Somber instrumental
music continues] â™ª

you really saw me.

I do.

No, you just fed into it,
like the rest of them.

So, maybe it's me that...

doesn't really know you.

I need to clear my
head, I'm gonna...

go on a walk, alone.

'Cause I'm gonna take care
of myself from now on.

â™ª JOY TO THE WORLD. â™ª

â™ª THE LORD IS COME. â™ª

â™ª LET EARTH... â™ª

â™ª RECEIVE... â™ª

her king.

[Knocking]
Jaylen...

I thought I'd find you here.


I need to thank
you, for tonight.

You don't have to thank me.

No, I do.

And, I need to apologize.

It's just, when I got
cut from Pop Star,

it was like a punch to the gut.

Just...

watching you
achieve it all is...

â™ª [Gentle piano
music continues] â™ª

I know that must have been hard.

But even worse than
that, I let my pride

get in the way of
our friendship.

But you know...

Pop Star USA isn't the only
way to a singing career.

It's one path out of a million.


Everything always
came so easily to me,

I just expected it to continue.

You know, small
fish, big pond...

drowns in ocean.

[Playing somber piano note]


Well, you do have a friend
in LA with some connections,

if you ever want to
swim there again.

You're so talented, Lorelei.

Do not give up on yourself.

If you're willing to
give it another go...


Feliz Navidad.

â™ª [Gentle instrumental music] â™ª

Hi, can I get a beer, please?

Thank you.

â™ª [Holiday music in
the background] â™ª


This drink is on me.

was all my fault.


Well, what can I say?

We Rodriguez's love hard.

Look, I'm not a Rodriguez.

I'm just the hired help.

And I know better not to
get emotionally involved.

Oh, wah-wah, poor you.

This family welcomed
you, with open arms,

and you became a Rodriguez
whether you liked it or not.

You know...

Just for a minute...

I got to feel what
it was like to be

a part of something that...

that wasn't temporary.

Yeah, I know this was a
job and you were putting on

a show, but I know a
thing or two about people.

And, you're not that
good of an actor.

Well, thanks for the compliment.

All of this was real for you.


Maybe.

But then, I underestimated her.

So, did I.

All her life, and
she still loves me.

Go to her!

It's not that simple.


â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music continues] â™ª

You know what?

I need your help with something.

You game?

[Glasses clinking]

Ah, what do we have here?

Baby Luisa.

Another for baby Luisa.

Otro mas para baby Luisa.

[Phone chiming]

Jaylen, para ti.

And, baby Luisa.

How much is this
gonna set me back?

Aye! It's our first
grandchild and I'm going to

spoil her rotten, and
you're going to accept that.

Understood.

Where is he going? It's
time to open presents.

Yeah, I have something
to say, and I'll,

I'll tell Hector
when he gets back in.

Before we go further, um...

I'm sorry.

I will never lie to you again.

But I need something
from all of you.

I am no longer
Jay-Jay, La Cobaya.

I am not a baby, and...

I don't need saving.

I want to be completely
honest with you, but I...

I need the space to
be able to do that.

â™ª


â™ª

I'm sorry.

I put my past experience on you.

My story is not your story.

It's not.

And if I stumble and fall,
I will pick myself up.

Mhm, and we will
be there for you.

Always.

Gracias.

There are still gifts to open.

This one is for Matt.

Oh, I haven't seen
him yet this morning.

Well, I'm sure you two will
find a way to work things out.

He cares very much
for you, you know.

That was clear to all of us.

I know... I know.

I always known, right here.


this wise man was alone...

without his trusting
companions...

he traveled far and wide,

searching high and low,

for the family he
only dreamed of.

And followed the star
that led him home.

Of course, this
star was a pop star.

And this wise man, well,
he spent his life...

being not so wise.

Until love changed him.

And now, he arrives...

bearing gifts.

Well, at least one gift.


No, no, I can't stand
the smell of that stuff.


Why don't we leave you
two to talk, alone?

I'm okay, I'll stay here.

Mama, vamanos.
Okay...

You stay there, you talk.

We will be inside
if you need us.

Just, just call.
Call me if you need.

â™ª

Open it.

â™ª [Gentle piano
music continues] â™ª

A place for your songs.

Now I, I know I
don't know how to be

a part of a family, but...

you all make it so effortless.

Are you sure you want
that? I know we're a lot.

I know, you're a lot.


But I'm sure.

â™ª [Gentle instrumental
music continues] â™ª

I'm sorry to make you
go along with the lie.

I was wrong to put
you in that position.

But no more.

We're all about the truth now.

Well, if I'm still welcome...

I'd like to be a part of it all.

Yeah?

Yeah.

â™ª

I'm gonna kiss you right now.

In front of this giant,
ridiculous manger.

And in front of the
entire Rodriguez family,

watching us from the
living room window.
