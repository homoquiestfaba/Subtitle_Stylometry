[high-pitched ringing]
[man breathing heavily]


[breathing heavily]

[exhales deeply]

[music playing faintly
on speakers]

[man] You want cheese?
Sure.

Lettuce, tomato?

Uh, let me get some
lettuce, tomato,

and let me get
some of those peppers.


Done.

Yo, are you high?

I said peppers,
not cucumbers.

Sorry, sir, my bad.

Mayo, mustard?

Uh, mayo, and, uh,

give me some of that
salt and pepper, buddy.

[phone line ringing]

Black Canopy Global Security.

Hi, Dorith.
This is Jackson Briggs.

I was just checking
on my status

for the Pakistan rotation.

Um, just trying
to sort my travel.

Mr. Briggs, you know the
agency can't send a soldier

with a history of brain
injuries to a war zone.

No, no, I just got you guys
a full, clean medical.

Yes, but we need

your commanding officer
to certify that.

Yeah, and I've told
the recruiter, like, 12 times.

You know these guys.

They're impossible
to reach on deployment.

But it's coming.
So let's just get

the on-boarding process going

and, I don't know,
get my travel sorted.

Mr. Briggs,
you know we can't do that.

Look, I got other agencies
beating down my door,

so, look...

So, look, I can't wait till
next year's rotation, okay?

And we can't staff you
without that recommendation.

Okay, uh, when do I need
to have it by?

The rotation closes
next Wednesday.

All right,
you'll hear from me.

[breathing heavily]

[ringtone playing]

[ringtone stops]

Hello.
Briggs, this is Jones.

Hey, Captain.

Are you in the middle
of something?

No, no, it's a good time.

Yeah, no, I was calling about

that diplomatic
security application

I was hoping you'd
help me with.

Look, I'm calling
about Rodriguez.

He passed away last night.

Stop me
if you already heard this.

No.

No, I didn't hear.

I'm sorry, Briggs.

We're all going
to Patton Barracks

to say goodbye to him.

When?
Tomorrow night.

All right.

Briggs?
Yeah, I'll be there.

[breathes shakily]

[somber music playing]

was a legend

who never quit.

He burned bright
and then he burned in.

Airborne Ranger in the sky.

in the sky.

You can tell an Airborne
Ranger by his boots!


â™ªâ™ª Glorious! Victorious! â™ª

â™ªâ™ª Ay! One keg of beer
For the four of us! â™ªâ™ª

[singing echoes
indistinctly]

[somber music continues]
Man.


Just need you to call
and just be like, "He's good."

No.
That's it.

I'm trying to get some money.
It's not happening.

I'm trying to get
some money, that's it.

Not happening.
[Briggs] 200K a year,

that's all I want.
[overlapping chatter]

Just, like,
make the call for me.

Yeah, I wish I had that power,

but your boy's
still an E-6, so...

[laughs]
...that's not happening.

I love him.
You shut your mouth.

You shut your mouth
when you talk about him.

[somber music playing]
[chatter continues]

Good luck, brother.


Get up, Kiernan. Come on.

Oh, no.
You're pissing me off.

Let's go.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

Up, up.
Hey, hey, figure it out.

Figure it out.

Okay, Briggs, get on with it.

What?
You know what.

Hey, you're the one who's

screening my calls
and ghosting my texts, sir.

Like, what's a girl
supposed to think?

He's supposed to get the hint.

"Hi, it's Captain Jones

calling on behalf
of Staff Sergeant Briggs.

He's a total badass,

he's squared away,
good to go."

You made that call
for 50 other soldiers.

Yeah, who haven't been flagged
for TBIs.

Take it up with the doctors,
not me.

Look, Bear's got half a hand.

You got a, like a chunk

of shrapnel stuck
in your tramp stamp.

Kiernan can barely remember
his name.

Shut your mouth.
There's a hundred concussions

walking around
this entire parking lot.

[Jones grunts]
And it's not stopping y'all.

In, in.


Maybe check your email.
I got a full, clean medical.

Yeah? How much
you pay for that?

That's not the point.

Sir, name it,
what do you want?

Tell me what you want.

get home safe.

get in... Okay.

You want me to get the...

All right, I'm getting
the knee pads.

[engine starting]

I'm getting the knee pads,
sir. Come on.

Are you really just gonna
pull out right now?

Might as well
just get the strap

out of the center console
and put me down

if I can't get back
in the game,

just go ahead
and end it for me.

Just put me out of my misery,
it's fine.

That's an order.

Sir, where are you goin'? Sir!

Sir!

[car door opens]

Airborne!


Staff Sergeant Briggs
is a total badass, huh?


Oh, hey, Captain.

Figured I'd find you
still here.

Get yourself together.

Come meet me
in Battalion in 30.

Does that mean
you're gonna make the call?

Hey, Captain, all the guys
talk shit about you,

but I always knew
you had a heart of gold,

and I was like,
"Not my captain.

No."

["Cut Em In"
playing on car stereo]

â™ªâ™ª Sometimes you need a foe â™ª

â™ªâ™ª One that keep your eyes open
Keep you on your toes â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª You know the ones That wanna
keep you Where you been before â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª But I can't go, No,
I can't go And woah â™ªâ™ª

What's up, man?
Howdy.

Thank you.

[music stops]
It's expired, sir.

Oh, come on, man.

You know how many times I've been
in and out of this gate with that?

Excuse me?

Okay, think about it.
What's the odds I'm ISIS?

Step out of the vehicle, sir.

You want me to step out
of the vehicle...

Hey.
...I'll happily...

He's with
the Ranger battalion.


You're required
to dispose of this.

What did you say?
I'm sorry, what?

Thank you for your service.

Energetically will I meet
the enemies of my country!

[soldiers repeating in unison]

I shall defeat them
on the field of battle!

[soldiers repeating]

For I am better trained.
[soldiers repeating]

And will fight
with all my might!

[soldiers repeating]

is not a Ranger word.

[soldiers repeating]

a fallen comrade...

What? Y'all gave away
my parking spot.

I had to walk all the way
from the DFAC.

Keep pushing.
Where are y'all headed?

We're wheels down in Syria
in 24 hours.

C-17 is loading up
as we speak.

I really appreciate this,

I ain't gonna let you down.

I've been working
the last three years

to get it straight
for this job.

That's what I like to hear.

Kennelo, what did I say about

using your mom's weights?
Like...

I'm trying to look good
for your mom.

Well, I'm just trying
to say, just...

I don't know, more quads.

Gonna give you a baby brother.

So what do you gotta do?
Interview me or something

to make sure I've got
a brain cell left, or...

Yeah, something like that.

"Jump," I say, "How high?"

Wait, isn't your office
this way?


Riley's stuff
just about ready, Kiernan?

Just about, sir.

You good, man?

It is what it is.


Riley was about as solid
as they come.

Tell that to the tree
he hit doin' 120.

let's go, come on.

happen to his dog?

Thought you'd never ask.

Family funeral's Sunday
outside of Nogales.

She's the guest of honor.

Oh, that's...
That's a genius idea.

I hope she doesn't
eat everybody first.

[chuckles softly] Well,
that part will be up to you.

Wait, wait, what?

[dogs barking]
[man shouting indistinctly]

off late last night.

And his mother called this morning.
She wants his hero dog at the funeral.

Sir, are you asking me to fly
a damn dog to Arizona?

No, I'm asking you
to drive a Ranger to Arizona.

She refuses to fly.

Why ain't she deploying
with you?

Won't work with anyone. One minute she's good, the
next minute, she's sending three guys to the ER.

Riley kept trying after you guys got
blown up, but she's gone all the way.

Maybe Riley should have thought of that before
he broke the speed of sound into a tree.

Yeah, well, Rangers find a way to die.
Hold on, let me get this straight,

so I agree to do this,
and you're gonna call Black Canopy

and get my packet pushed.
You do this, and then I make the call, no screw-ups,

nothing gets back to me. After the service,
you drop off on base down at White Sands,

they'll handle the rest.

White Sands? So they're just
gonna put her down anyway.

There's not a handler or a PD
crazy enough to adopt her up.

Doesn't make us feel warm and fuzzy inside.
Just is what it is.

How about I disappear her ass, you make the call,
and we both go on with our lives? How about that?

You stick your neck out for Battalion,
I'll stick mine out for you.

Take it or leave it.
Sir...

Ready to pick up
your furry flash-bang?

That's what I'm told, man.

Here's the deal, Briggs,

this isn't the same dog
you served with,

she's got every combat trigger
in the book.

So you keep her secured

and you don't take her out
in public.

We clear?

All right.

If anyone asks, say she's
on her way to rehabilitation.

Hey, do you want me
to leash her up for you?

No, let's just
get this over with.

All right.

What's up, dog?

You remember me?

[growls softly]

Your favorite chew toy
from 2015.

Huh?

Me and you are gonna go
on a little road trip.

[dog panting]


Just to act like your daddy's
looking down on us from above.

All right, I'm gonna
leash you up.

All right?

Be cool. Easy.

Easy.

You really did give up, huh?

What are y'all so scared of?
She's milding out big-time.

[groans]
[laughter]


Enough!

Hey, man, I forgot to tell you
not to touch her on the ears, man.

I left that part out.

[barking and whining]

her off the Prozac,

so she might get moody
from time to time.

Her muzzle can only stay on

for about two hours at a time
or she'll overheat.

Make sure you put water
in her food,

and as you know,
don't touch her ears.

Other than that,
here's your Bible.

Have a good trip.
See you, Trent.


Thank you, sir.

All the belongings in
Sergeant Rodriguez's backpack

go to his family.

They want his uniform
at the funeral.

The "I Love Me" book,
that stays with Lulu.

If you have any trouble,
all her info's in there.

I'm not gonna be out there
long enough.

Hey.
Rangers lead the way, sir.

All the way.
[Lulu barking]

[man 1] Good luck.
[Briggs] All right, boys.

[man 2] Looks like Briggs
finally got a girl.

["Run It" playing]

â™ªâ™ª Can't try much harder
To get back to water â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª Gonna get back hotter
Get back, get back to water â™ªâ™ª

[line ringing]
This is Dorith.

Hey, Dorith,
this is Jackson Briggs again.

I was just calling
to let you guys know

that I only fly business class

to countries with names
that end in "stan."

Sir, we're still missing
your recommendation.

Uh, look, it's actually
what I was callin' about.

[whining]
So, first thing

Monday morning, uh,

you'll be getting a call
from Captain Luke Jones

from Second Ranger Battalion.

If we hear from your captain
before Wednesday,

I'll let the RSO know

to expect you on rotation.
[whining and barking]

Yes, ma'am, I'm very, very
happy to be working with...

[continues barking]
Yes, sir, I can't hear you...

Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am,
thank you so much. I... Okay.

[Lulu barking]


What is your deal, man?

Come on.
[whines]

You're just slobbering
all over my seat.

[barking and whining]

Maybe just take
the crazy down.

Just like one notch.
[Lulu whining]

Just one notch, that's it,
and maybe we could get along.

[whines]
And if we get along,

maybe we could
even have some fun

and send Riley off right.

[whining]
Doesn't that sound nice, dog?

I'm all you got, I'm it.

It's just me.
[whining]

Believe it or not,
I don't wanna

keep you all muzzled up 24/7.

I really don't.

And to be honest,
I don't wanna drive

straight to some
dry-ass desert town

and just sit in a motel and stare at a
wall for five days waiting for his funeral.

[barks]
Do you?

Okay, okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

All right. So I gotta
take your muzzle off,

but if you bite me,

I'm gonna leave it on
all the way to Arizona.

[Lulu growling]
So be chill,

all right? That's great.
[growling stops]

[starts growling]
Just remember all those times

we had fun kicking in doors,
getting our murder on.

[growling]
Relax, I'm not the bad guy.

Easy. Do not bite me
in the face, all right?

I'm gonna reach up,

I'm not gonna touch your ears,
or near your ears.

[growling]
All right, I'm not touchin' that, I'm not touchin' that.

All right, all right. We're good, we're good.
Okay, look at that. We did it, we did it.

We did it.

All right.
[barking]

Hey, no, no, stop!

Stop it. Hey, hey, chill out.

Fine, fine.
Stay in there then.

Stay in there, have fun.

Bye, crazy town.



[high-pitched ringing]

[ringing continues]

[gunshot]
[ringing continues]





[indistinct chatter]
[Briggs humming]

Hey, you ready to go
to the shitters?

[Lulu growling]
Hey! No, no, no. No!

No!
[growling]

I'm gonna kill you. Oh, my...

No! [frustratedly]
Oh, my God!

You just stay right there!

You know, I was
gonna let you have

a little bit of fun
on this trip.

I was gonna let you
run and frolic,

you know, sniff some buttholes
and all that, but no,

turns out they are right,
you're just a demon.

You're just a demon!

[growling]
All right,

last chance to apologize.

No?

All right, fine.
Night-night, bitch.

Oh, what's happening?

You're gettin' a little sleepy
back there?

Someone gettin'
a little tired, tired?

Oh, allergy season
is brutal this year.

Man, you used to be a legend.
Not no more, huh?

You're just falling asleep
on me.

Wait, what'd you say?

Oh! Daddy should go out and get some
beers, you're right.

Let you get a little shut-eye.
Okay, I'll do that.

That's really nice of you.
You're right, too,

I haven't been laid
in a while.

Maybe not as long as you
but that's not the point.

Still sad,
and we'll keep that a secret.

All right, Portlandia,
let's turn it up.

â™ªâ™ª A-weema-weh, a-weema-weh
A-weema-weh, a-weema-weh â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª A-weema-weh, a-weema-weh

Hey, sorry, man.
No GMOs here,

only bio-dynamic microbrew.

Cool, I don't want that.
What's this?

What're you...
Ma'am, what're you having?

[woman] Maker's.
[Briggs] Maker's.

Can we get two more
of those, please?

You want me to tease it,
or add to it?

Please don't tease it,
just Maker's in a glass.

That'll be great.
Awesome.

Look, all I'm saying is
every single one of those kids

got out of the compound
all right.

We're not heroes.
We just do our jobs.

I mean, you don't have to
wait in this line, you know?

You just pop on that
VR headset, and boom,

you're at the illest bar
on Earth,

hanging with guys like me.

How do you get to
the actual beers, though?

Virtual beers, bro.
That's the beauty of it.

'Cause you must be, like,

just the biggest Billy Ray
Cyrus fan of all time.

Well, I am actually
a huge country fan.

It's just a little hard
for me to get behind the

toxic masculinity, you know.

Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying. Yeah.

So at what point
did you realize

that you were just a pawn
for big oil?

Just body bags

carrying out
ecological genocide

for the corporate elite.

All these big oil fat cats,

they think that
they own this place.

They think they own
Mother Earth,

but no one owns Mother Earth,

and I'm gonna fight
against them every day

for the rest of my life

because it's just not...
Wow!

...'cause I don't wanna see
those ducks in the goo.

Look, and if you invite 50

of your Instagram friends,
you get half off.

What does this get me?
Free drink.

On me.
Cool.

No, no, no, no version of you

ever paying my bill.
Please, no chance.

Would you like me
to come right back?

No, we're good, I promise.
[waitress] Okay.

Her money is no good here.

I got it.
Oh.

Tonight, I said to myself,
you're gonna love this,

I said, "You will meet
a construction worker

or a soldier."

That's interesting.
Or, I don't know,

any man without
a white savior complex.

Good luck.

Wait, what?

I hope that you get
the help that you need.

Thanks for the drink.
No, no. Look, look,

look, hey, I've been trapped
by the Taliban.

Hey.

We gotta get outta here

because you are about the only woman in this entire city
that I would actually like to have a conversation with.

[pouring liquid]
Here,

this is a peace offering.

Be chill, and I'll be chill
with you. Here.

Look, I didn't want
to drug you.

You didn't have to eat my
seats, that's all I'm saying.

We can be friends, but this is
gonna be an eye for an eye.

Are we gonna be cool?
[whining]

Or do we need to have
another meeting of the mind?


Fine, you don't wanna
trust me, fine.

I don't even care.

I definitely don't trust you,
so whatever.

Is that a Belgian Mal?

Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is.

She's beautiful.
Hi, sweet girl.

Are you a rescue?
[Briggs] Uh, sort of.

[woman 1] Does she like
other dogs?

[woman 2] Oh, yeah.
No, um, no, no.

Actually she's, um,
she's a little sad right now.

She's... She's, um, grieving.

She lost her best friend.

[woman 1] Oh, no, sweetheart.

I know. Who are...
Who are these little cuties?

Oh, this is Lucy.
This is Maggie.

Aw, they're so cute.

[woman 1] They're Shih Tzus.
They're great.

Oh, I love Shih Tzus.

Here you go.
Thank you.

Mmm-hmm. Cheers.

I was about to give up on
this city before I met y'all.

Well, Portland's not
for everybody.

I don't know,
it's growin' on me.

It's not every day you meet
two plant musician ladies.

[women chuckling]

We're actually
Tantrikas.Um...

Okay.
Yeah.

We DJ ecstatic dance circles
sometimes, though.

That's sick. Is that, like...
That's like yoga?

I've done yoga.
But I'm horrible at it.

We help heal people
by moving blocked energy

so they can experience

the full potential
of sexual pleasure.

Oh.

So you just move
the energy for...

Hell, yeah. I can...

I mean, I got... I got cash
in the truck, I think.


No, the attraction
is completely genuine.

Ah. I mean...

As long as
it's in the flow for you.

No, I'm good.

Kidding.
[women laughing]

I'm so in...
I'm so in the flow.


[panting and whining]

Great, I love some
chakrastuff.

Do we smoke that or...

No.
No?

This is... This is rad.
[shushing]

[Lulu barking in distance]

Does your baby wanna come in?

Nope, she's good,
she's just happy.

She's a happy...
That's a happy bark.

She's just letting me know.

How are our hearts
in this moment?

[whining and barking]

Mmm, my heart is, um...

just full and it's like...

I mean, I got a new job.

Yeah, uh, things are
really looking up.

I just feel solid.
I feel solid over here,

I'm ready to go.

Um, I'm not quite there yet.
Okay.

Hmm.
Okay.

But maybe yab-yum
would help move some prana.

This is what my heart needed.

Yeah, let's go.
Mmm.

So good, right?

[women sighing in unison]

All right.

May I have permission
to remove your shirt?

Hell, ye...
I'm gonna remove it for you.



Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

[barking]
Why are you so upset?

Oh, poor baby.
[whining and barking]

Oh, my Buddha.

Oh, no, no. That's, like,
some old army shit.

Don't worry about that.

You guys...
What's this from?

I don't know. That one is...

The big one's an AK round.

Your body is in so much pain.
I'm so sorry, we had no idea.

No, no, look, it's fine.

It's fine. Do I have permission
to remove your shirt?

'Cause I wanna take care
of your heart.

This is why we were
drawn together.

[Lulu growling]
What an asshole.

[Lulu barking]

What?

Place my hand...
Mmm-hmm.

...wherever your pain
guides it.

Yeah, I can do that.

I like this plan.
Why don't we start here?

Let's get you out of here.
[barking]

[woman 1] I'm sorry, um...

Okay, uh...
I'm sorry. I can't, uh,

I can't hold this pace.
I'll go check on her,

how about that?
I'll go check on her. Just...

You stay right there
and you just keep the energy.

[Lulu barking]
Hey!

Hey! What are you doing?

Freeing that abused animal.

You throw that rock and we're
about to see who's abused.

Of course you threaten
violence, you redneck!

the one with the rock, man.

Just put it down
and walk away.

I promise you...
Animals are people, too.

Okay...
Let her out now or I will.

You understand...
[woman 1] Are you okay?

What's going on?
Oh, no. It's no big deal.

He's just a nice man,
came over

to make sure the dog...
[glass shattering]

Dog, get back here!

[man screaming]
[Briggs] No!


[Lulu growling]

No!
Get it off.

Heel!
Release!

Come on. All right.
Come on. Let go!

Stop it.
[man] I'm callin' the cops.

What are you tryin' to do?
[Lulu whining]

You... Son of a...

All right, now,
you ruined an epic threesome.

No. Hey! Ah!

[women scream]
[Briggs] Bitch!

Where are you guys going?

[door slams]

What about...
What about my pain?

[Lulu panting]
God, just get in the car.

to you, dog, huh?

Remember when Maretti died?

Riley made us watch, like,
15 hours of Grey's Anatomy.

Everybody was sitting around
and then you just came around

with your fat head,
nuzzling everybody,

being all cute,
making everybody laugh.

Whatever happened
to that dog, huh?


The army has no place
for liabilities

and that's all you are now.

See, you know,
that's the difference

between you and I, though.

You know that?

Those brain doctors said
I'd be on disability

for the rest of my life.

Not your dad, though.

Your dad, they just sent back
with no questions asked.

They said I'd never
see straight,

I'd have headaches
and if I got stressed out,

that I'd have seizures and die
or some bullshit like that,

but you don't see some little
seizure stopping me, do you?


But you, on the other hand,
look, if you don't want it,

ain't no cure for that shit.

Nope.

People like me and you

are better off just being
all in or all out.

I just wouldn't want some
bullshit-ass injection,

like you're going to have. I mean, it's
not like you've got a choice in the matter,

but it's just not
a warrior's death.

[Lulu whining]

steal a prop plane

and fly that bitch
right into the sun

till the engines froze out.

And then I'd swan dive
right out of the cockpit

and laugh my ass
all the way to Valhalla.

[Lulu barking]

Hey, come on, man,
stop the whining.

You sound like
a whiney-ass chihuahua.

Oh, shit. Okay. Hey, hey, hey!

Hey! No, no, no!

[car honking]

[Lulu barking]

Hey! Hey!

No, no!

Hey! [grunts]

Hey, look. No, no, no, no.
Come here.

Hey, dog!

Dog, come here. No!


Come here! [grunting]

Hey, dog!

Dog!

[Lulu barking in distance]


Hey, dog!

Hey, come!

[door creaking]

Oh, shit.

No, no, no, no, no. Dog, we're
not supposed to be in here.

Let's go.

Hello?

[door creaks]


Come!

Dog?

Come on. [grunts]
[dart fires]


[door creaking]

Hey!

[high-pitched ringing]
[breathing heavily]

[pig grunting]

Oh, shit. You've gotta
be kidding me.

Dog!

[pig grunts]

[breathing heavily]

Hey, dog!
[pig grunting]


Hello!


Hey, what did you hit me with, man?
Horse tranq?

This is pretty good.

to start squealing.

Hey, have you seen a dog?

She's brown, she's, like,
running around,

I don't know,
with crazy eyes, huh?



who you think I am.

who the hell you are.

Think you're the first
commando they sent up here?

Take my strains?

Look, old man, unless
you're willing to walk this

till the end of the road,

I highly suggest
you cut me loose

and let me go find
my damn dog.

to clear your head,

or you can join her ass.

[grunts and groans]

[breathing heavily]


[groans and pants]

[zip tie snaps]
[grunts]

[pig grunting]


Hell, yeah.

[man speaking indistinctly]

Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

We'll see about that.

Bitch!

[operatic music playing softly
on speakers]

[man mumbling indistinctly]

Oh, that is...
That's bullshit.

[man speaking indistinctly]

come here.

[Lulu panting]
[whispers] Now! Come here!

Come here!


He's zip-tied in the barn.


What the hell
did you do to him?

I told him I killed his dog.

about interrogation?

You were
a conscientious objector.

damn appreciation?

those edibles so hard.

Cartel? You paranoid maniac.

Tell him you're...
[Gus] You're crazy, I'm not...

...a scared old fool
who needs heavy therapy.

Just tell him you're sorry.

with a tranquilizer.


[woman] Now you're making me upset this little nugget.
[panting]

This perfect noodle...

the hell out of here.

at your little, little paw.

You're so good.

So good.

So good.
[Lulu grunts softly]


[woman] Honey...
Look, Jesus, I...


Sit down.

Uh...

How'd you make her
eat out of your hand?

[Lulu whining]

I didn't make her
do anything.

I just talked to her.

By the way, you can do
anything you like

with my idiot husband.

Gus, apologize.

My bad, my bad.

[Lulu whining and panting]

she's just a noodle.

She just needs some good...

I'm just going to touch her
little, little paw.

Is she gonna be okay?

Well, I'm worried she may
have broken her foot,

but I'm gonna try my best.

You need to give, um...
What is her name?

Lulu.

Lulu and I some space.

So, um, here.

Come on.
Gus, make yourself useful

and get this man
some clean clothes

because he's really
smelling strongly

of Boris and his friends.

So here, take some
homemade edibles.

Go make friends, okay?

Guys, come on, stop it.
Get outside.


you did this
with a damn shoestring.

compromise the plastic.

That's it. [chuckles]

Listen, I'm a lot better
at permaculture

than I am tying dudes up.

I need to know, man,
how close was I to...

Dying?
Yeah.

Pretty... Pretty close, actually. I almost
put an axe in the back of your head.


Well done.

Yeah, right? Right?
Hmm.

I'm just glad
you love that dog so much.

I don't love that dog.
It's not even my dog.

Come on, get on your back.

Get on your back,
you can do it.

Come on.
[Gus] Whose damn dog

Is it?
[zip tie snaps]

[both cheering]


You see this?
[Gus] Yeah.

They can smell their clothes from, like, a mile off.

Is this two dead dudes?

[Briggs laughs]

Yeah. Those are...
That's two Taliban,

uh, dope farmers right there.

Oh, don't look
all shocked, man.

It's war.
It's not all unicorns

and rainbow vaginas
out there, right?

Yeah, I bet.

So why do they call it
I Love Me book?

I don't know.
Uh, but in the army,

they just,
they make us all keep one.

They make us put every single,
last stupid detail in.

So, Lulu's greatest hits.
This is like...

Like her music.
Like, music she...

No, no, no, no, no.
It's the other greatest hits,

you know.

it's her bodycam footage.

Oh, Jesus.
Yeah.

It's the...
[imitates gunshots] kinda...

Yeah, I'll pass.

So let me get this right, man.

So, like, the dog
did all this, man.

I mean, they're just
going to put her down?

Look, don't get all
misty-eyed on me, big man.

Like, it's...
It's not like that.

That dog did exactly
what she was born to do,

and that was to live
a legendary life.

And she did it.

What the hell is this here?

"Dear Lulu,

I can hardly imagine life
before I knew you.

Did you come into this world
a beast of fury,

or were you just..."
What was that? What was that?

He wrote... It's like written
up on top right there.

There's a couple of 'em,

like poems or love letters,
or something.

Rodriguez could barely spell.

I mean, he definitely
can't rhyme.

I know what this is.
This is...

So when you have
a brain injury,

you basically get sent
to these brain doctors.

And then they study you,
and they make you draw

and write and do
all this art therapy bullshit.

Nobody really
takes it serious.

Shit!
Oh!

[woman laughs]
Dog!

You're okay. Hey.
[Lulu barking]

Look at her.
She's running around.

Yeah. There was just
a little piece of barbed wire

just lodged way up in her paw.

I sterilized it
and stopped the bleeding.

Never seen a dog so strong.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

Also, she did offer me
a transmission.

If you feel called.
Transmission?

Yeah, she bats
about 350 on those.

I mean, but, you know,

if it was baseball,
it'd be hall of fame numbers.


You two are definitely
karmically connected.

She must have incarnated
to find you.

I'm seeing pyramids.

Ancient Egypt.

Now, a young girl,
she's playing.


Does Lulu work with kids?

Uh, wow.

Yeah. She loves kids.

She loves 'em.

Oh.
And licks their faces

right off.
[Gus] Unbelievable.

I think it might be

your daughter.

Does she have a boy's name?

A boy's name?
Uh, Sam.


Um, what about my daughter?

Well, Lulu, she's bringing her
into my awareness.

How old is she?

Uh, three.

Let's... Let's just keep it
about the dog.



[inhales deeply] Hard, yes.

She's yearning for soft.

Yes, a bed.

A luxury mattress. [chuckles]

She says she's never slept
in a nice bed before.

She asks if it's okay.

She's asking me that?
[woman] Mmm.

Okay, yeah, sure.

Now I'm getting hot...
Tongue... Taste.

Yes.

Indian food she wants?
[Gus] Oh!

Are you kidding me?

Gus.
Strike three.

Gus, why do you undermine me?

don't want Indian food.

And by the way, the next time

don't run away,
just let me know,

and we can go get it together.

â™ªâ™ª It's turtles all the way

What are you looking at?


What you whining for?

You're the whole reason
we're up here.

Get comfy.

That's where
you're sleeping tonight.


[music stops]

your cage?

Look. It's Alcatraz,
it's right there.

Just take a little tour.

You know,
possibly just leave you there.

You only got about
three more days left

on this green Earth,
so you better speak now

or forever hold your peace.

[whines]
Hey, look, ain't no shame

in wanting a big,
comfy mattress, okay?

Look, I get it. I get it.

I've had three
back operations, so I get it.

Comfort is king.
But the facts are this...

They ain't letting two
rock eaters like me and you

in some bougie-ass hotel.

And I ain't about
that Holiday Inn life.

But I got an idea.

If you want that bed,

we gotta go big,
or we gotta go home.

Are you with me?

Hey.

Are you in or are you out?
[whines]

I'm going to take that
as a yes.

Thank you.


Hi. Welcome to the
Grand Regal, sir.

Oh, hi, sorry.
Hi.

Are you checking in?

Yes, please. I was...

I was hoping, uh,
that you might have

a room for me
and my little girl here.

Oh, well,
let me check on that.

Oh, is that a purple heart?
Was she wounded?

Uh...
[whines]

Yes, she was.
Oh.

Thank you
for your service. Oh.

Right when we walked in,

I said that, "Never in history

has a blind veteran
and his hero dog

walked into a hotel
and not gotten a free room."

And why did I say that?

Why did I say that happens
every time?

[panting]
[gasps] Oh, you're right.

Freedom. That is why
that happens. [chuckles]

What... What's your...
What's your deal?

Why are you... Are you hot?

Do you want water?

Huh?

Let's get this vest off you.
Come on, get up, get up.

Up! Come on.


Oh, man, you stink.

Okay, dog, here.

Come on, let's get in.

The water's fine.

Come here. Come on. Let's go.

You good little nugget.

Such a good little nugget.

Come on, little nugget.

Come on,
now get in the nugget bath.

Good girl, come on.

Come on. You're okay.

I'll dip you like a nugget.

you know,
I'll take what I can get

at this point, I guess.

All right.

Last bit, all right?

There we go.

One second. One Minute.

Hold on, I'm coming.

Yes, one second.

Um, one second, yes.

Coming.

Here with the room service.

Good evening.
Oh, good evening.

May I come in, please?
Yes, please.

All right.
I can take the door.

Anything else?
No.

Everything looks shipshape.
All right.

Thank you very much.
Have a good evening.

Hey, dog, you should
see this guy's face.


Get off! Get off there!

Don't do it! Stop!

No! No! You...

Okay. You know what?
I didn't even care anyways.

That was your bed.
'Cause I'm going out.


[TV playing indistinctly]

Do I look like 200k a year
or what?

Look at you, sitting on
the couch, looking all cute.

Why didn't you tell me
all I had to do was just

turn on the TV and put your greatest hits on
of you mauling people, to get you to relax?


What happened, no go
on the Indian food?

I told you,
you can't trust psychics.

But don't you worry.

I got exactly what you want.

Dry-aged, marbled-on-the-bone
beautifulness. Ready?

Take it, savor it. Come on.

You don't have to be scared.
Just take it out of my hand.

Whatever.

Do not do anything stupid.

What?

[whining]
Hell, no.

Oh, you think you're
coming with me?

Do you think I forgot
about Portland?

No.

I'll never forget
about Portland.

Ever.

Yes, Mr. Briggs.

Of course, yeah.
Wait, I know that voice.

Wait. Who's that?
Oh, we met at the front desk.

[Briggs] Oh, the... Yes.
Callan.

the front desk angel.

I'm looking for a place
to eat tonight.

Oh, there are...
Any good recommendations?

a fantastic oyster bar

down at the Embarcadero.


They really, you know,
heighten the senses.

What time do you get off?
[Lulu growling softly]

Uh, I'm off at 7:00.

7:00? What time is it now?
[Lulu barking]

Oh, no, no. No, no, no! Dog!

I can see.

I can see. Guys, I can see!

Hey, hey! Hey!

impersonating a blind man

as part of a seeing eye
dog training exercise?

[Briggs] Yep, that's right.
Mmm-hmm.

When suddenly, uh,
unbeknownst to you,

um, your dog broke free
from your grasp,

sprinted the entire length
of the lobby

and muzzle struck the victim?
Correct.

seen this dog exhibit

any type of aggressive
behavior before this?

Never. Never. She usually...
She loves people.

It's out of her character.
I really don't understand it.

Man, honestly, I'm in shock.
[clicks tongue] Uh-huh.

Is there anything else
you want to add?

How is the guy?
Is he all right?

Yeah.
He seemed okay.

Well, we're gonna
be contacting

Dr. Al-Farid in the morning.

He wants to press charges.
We'll take it from there.

Until then,
you just sit tight.

Dog's okay?

have to check

with animal control
on that one.

So when do I get her back?

Do I have to post bail
or whatever?

Buddy, it is Friday night.

Judge is not back
until Monday A.M.

And I am required
to keep all suspects

in possible hate crimes
in my custody.

Hate crime?

Now, don't start with me.
Take it to City Hall.

Who said anything about a hate
crime? Wait, wait, wait.

Hold on a second. Okay.
All right. Let me... Let me...

Let me level with you, man.

Okay? I was an Army Ranger.

That dog's handler was
my buddy, and he passed.

I got to take her down to his
funeral in Arizona on Sunday.

I got a Gold Star family
that's just depending on me

to get her there.

All right?
Now I'll be back here

first thing Monday morning.
I promise.

I just... I got to...
I got to get her

and I got to go tonight.

You were an Army Ranger?

[Briggs] Yeah.
[chuckles]

Why the hell
didn't you say so?

I'm sorry.
Instead of puttin' me through

20 minutes of that Ray Charles
bullshit, huh?

I was in the 202nd.

Hey, buddy,
I gotta tell you something.

And I gotta level with you.

You going into that
hotel lobby, huh,

with that damn cane
and those glasses, man.

You Army Rangers,

you've got balls of steel.

No. It was stupid.
I'm a huge fan, seriously.

Hey, I gotta ask you something,
on the real, on the real.

You sent that little beast
for that raghead, didn't ya?

What?
Huh?

Get a little payback for what
they took from us, right?

Right?
No. I... No,

definitely, I didn't do that.
Come on. Don't worry, man.

My lips are sealed.
I'm not gonna say nothing.

And us 31 Alphas,
we keep it tight.

You know?
Alpha 31s?

Yeah, we looked out for you
badasses real good.

Out by the front gate, right?

Oh, you were an MP.

Damn right.
Right.

What are you implying?

Oh, no, no,
I'm not implying anything.

No, I mean, we...

You MPs, man,
you guys got a hard job.

I never slept better
knowing that you guys

were out there
at the guardhouse,

on the wall, watching over us.

Yeah, I appreciate
that, brother.

Yeah, I appreciate it too
that you're not like

all those other Army Rangers
that I've met.

You know, with the long beards

flowing in the wind,
like they were Moses?

The car going right by the
front gate, not showin' an ID,

flipping us off,
"Thank you for your service."

Yeah, you're not one
of those guys, are you?

No, I...
No, no, no.

No, I definitely...
You know what?

I buy that.
You know what else I buy?

White military guy sics
his dog on a Muslim doctor

in the heart of
woke-ing class America.


Don't do this. Just let me
get my dog and go.

Oh, now it's your dog!

Sleep tight, bitch.


[door closes]



Line-up time.

Step to the left.

Really? A line-up?
It's like...

It's me, right?

step to your right.

What are we doing?
Did you guys even have dogs?

He seems like a cat guy.

Quiet, number three.
[over speakers] We all know it was me, right?

Yes, it was him.

Face forward.

It's him.

I got it. Thank you, sir.

Can I... Can I just, like...
You know what?

I'm just gonna confess.
How about that?

Step back, number three.

No, I'm sorry. Can I confess?
Is that, like, a thing?

Man, I've got lunch.

It was my fault. I don't...

Look, my dog,

she was just doing
what she was trained to do.

And unfortunately,
she was trained

to attack guys that look
like Dr. Al-Farid.

All right, that's enough,
number three.

Wait, let him speak.

There. But I'm sorry,
that is the truth.

She served seven years,
eight deployments,

but she did save more people
than you can count.

I'm not some racist
piece of shit,

but I'll confess to whatever
it is that you want me to

or do whatever you want me to,

as long as someone promises me

that they will get her
to that funeral this Sunday.

Is that a deal
that I can make?


All right.
Take him out of here.

Really? Nothing.
[man] Next group in five.

That's it?


So you impersonated
a blind man

just to get a free hotel room?

Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.

Um, there was a psychic

and she said that
she wanted...

My dog wanted a mat...
Like, a comfy mattress.

And some... Never mind.

It's... It's insane.

It is insane.

And if you want my

non-clinical opinion,
so are you.

Yeah, that's... That's fair.

But the more I sit with it,
it's even more insane to

leave my practice
and fly back from Boston

just to prosecute a veteran

trying to get his dog
to a funeral.

Just promise,
when it's all done,

you'll seek professional help.

I, uh... Yes, sir.

Salaam.
Salaam.

Yeah, she runs... She runs

I'll make you a deal.

You don't do anything
all psychotic on this trip,

and we make good time,
we can go see him.

Maybe, okay? Is that a deal?

Shake? [laughing]

Shake. You got it.


Okay, deal.

Jesus Christ. All right.

â™ªâ™ª But in his final words I
found an ace That I could keep â™ªâ™ª


â™ªâ™ª You've got to know When to
hold 'em Know when to fold 'em â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª Know when to walk away
And know when to run â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª You never count your money When
you're sittin' At the table â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª There'll be time enough for
countin' When the dealin's done â™ªâ™ª

[music stops]

[indistinct chatter]

Okay, game time.

Look, if I'm spending
too long in there,

you have full permission
to go psychotic,

like usual, and I'll come out.

Jacket or no jacket? I feel like
the jacket's too much.

What am I doing,
talking to you?

[Lulu whines]

[car door shuts]


[Lulu barks]


Mommy, Curious George
turned off.


I'll be right there, okay?
Mmm-hmm.

Mommy, who's there?

one of Mommy's friends.

[chuckles]
[woman] Go to my room,

I'll bring your pasta
in a few minutes, okay?





[sighs deeply]


Well, you want it? You got it.

Okay, dog, I tried my family,
let's try yours.

[engine starting]

[barking]
What?

Look, if your brother
ain't here,

we are definitely not waiting.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no.

[Noah] Nuke!
[Briggs] Hey, Noah.

I'm sorry to barge in, man.

Lulu, is that you?

I'm one of Riley's
old teammates,

and I figured, you know,
I'd let her see her brother.

[Lulu barking]
Watch her...

I know, I know.

She's sensitive on the ears,
aren't you, girl?

[Lulu whining]
Good girl. Hey.

Oh, yeah.

You give hugs now, really?

Oh, yeah.
Lulu gives the best hugs.

You've never had a Lulu hug?

No, we don't... We don't...
We don't exactly hug.

You a medium or a large?

Are you bitching out on me?

No, I'm not bitching out on you. She's
been wanting to kill me for three days.

[barking]
Come on, let's go.

Give it to me,
come on, let's go.

You're having fun.

This is fun.
[barking]

Oh, having fun?
Just look at her.

She wants to murder me.


Relax.
[Briggs] Come on, come on.

Come on, we'll make it fun.
[Lulu barking]

It's fun. Take a little piece.

Take a little piece.
I know you like it.

I know you want it.
[panting]


Remind me again
why we want her to bite.

She doesn't know what war is.
For her, it's just work.

You've got to show her
that work can be fun again,

nothing bad
is going to happen, okay?

That's how you make a bond.

I don't need to make
a bond, okay?

I just... What, am I not
fun enough for you?

You're fun.
Come on.

Just hold your arm up
a bit higher.

It's up, man. Take it.

Come on, just get it.
[Nuke barks]

Good boy, Nuke. Good boy!
Good boy.

Let him know
this is love, your chew toy,

this is fun.

Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

telling me that Nuke

was just as messed up as Lulu.

I'd been working every day
for six months

before I convinced the army
to let me adopt him out.

Thought we'd never get there.

Now we trust Nuke to babysit.

Kids, burgers!

Shit.

Daddy, was this on the ground?

No.
You're lying. I saw it fall.

Baby, I dropped it
into my hand, okay?

It's fine. You're fine.
[grunts in frustration]


[music playing faintly]

Saturdays.

I can barely
take care of the dogs.

I don't know
how you're doing all this.

Yeah, I get it.

Nuke was about
all I could handle,

but when he stopped
struggling,

that's when I realized
maybe I could

stop struggling too, you know?

could've fixed Lulu?

in the fight, no.

You gotta know when to hang
'em up or check out, I guess.

Well, sometimes Rangers
just find a way to die, man.

Give Riley's mom a big hug.

They didn't talk much, I know,
but she meant a lot to him.

Yeah, I will, man.

Oh, come on. No! Shit!
You gotta be kidding me.

No, it's a real
nice neighborhood

you got here, man.

They got all my shit.
They got Riley's shit.

They got my meds.

Well, that's good.

At least I can give
his parents his dog tags.

[Lulu whining]
[Briggs] Oh, good.

They left your unicorn.

[Lulu barking]
Lulu, Lulu, here.

Seek.



[Noah] Good boy.
[Briggs] Lulu, seek.


What's in here?

There we go.

Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

Okay, okay. Come on, Nuke.

Come, Nuke. Nuke. Seek.

I guess we're going
in the right direction.

Seek, seek.

Seek, seek.


Put the water on,
I'm sure it's boiling.

Yes, pesto is fine.

We're... I'm just showing
my buddy the Boardwalk.

Sorry, Tiffany, I just
wanted to see the piers.

We'll be back soon, okay?


Nuke!
[woman] Oh, hey!


[Lulu barking]
Yeah, Lulu, go, go, seek.


Just don't let her go.
Seek, Nuke.

Seek.

Seek, Nuke.

Seek, seek, seek.

Find it, Nuke. Find it.

[indistinct chatter]

[man] Hey! Hey!
[Briggs] Seek.




Seek. Seek.

Seek.

[Lulu sniffing]

[Briggs] Seek.
[Lulu whines]

[barking]
[Briggs] Yeah, yeah,

she found it, she found it.



Yeah, yeah, it's my shit.
It's just everywhere.

This crackhead's
probably snorting

my migraine meds right now.

[dogs barking]

Yeah, most of
Riley's shit's here.

Her book's here.

Hey, what is this shit, man?
This is private property.

Oh, is it? That's yours?
Yeah.

All right, Jackson, let's go.
Your name's Rodriguez?

Man, I'm a United States
army veteran, man.

Yeah? Take it off right now.

I ain't taking off shit.
What battalion were you in?

That's classified.

[groaning and screaming]

Get it off!

[thief continues screaming]
Oh, goddamn, man.

Hey, I serve my country,

and this is the thanks I get?

I'm a war hero!

outta here, man!

all good without those meds?

just let her eat

that stolen valor
piece of shit.

like that who served.

And if you were here
five years ago,

you could have caught my ass
under that pier,

and that would have been
the best-case scenario.


'Cause that bullshit ain't us.

Yeah?

What about Riley?

What about Riley?

I mean, the dude couldn't get out
of bed without popping three percs.

Well, that's just
the breakfast of champions,

and he was a champion.

I can't tell you how many
times he called me up,

we'd get shitfaced
talking about

how we were gonna check out.

Look, man, we all
deal with shit

to stay in the game, okay?

So we're supposed
to stay in it forever?

He used to talk
about driving off

the Grand Canyon at top speed,

but he drove himself
into a tree instead.

I tried to get him to talk.

Talk, like what,
to a therapist?

That was a great idea.

No, to other guys
who have gone through it,

or even just to God.

God?

Okay, you didn't know shit
about Riley, all right?

Look, by God, I mean anything.

Could be a rock,
could be a shoe,

could be his damn barber.

But we all got to pick
something at some point.


he didn't, and he won't.

So ain't no use
bitching about it.

to put the whole world

on our back.

At the end of the day,

the hardest thing was knocking
on a friend's door.

Bye, Lulu.

Say hi to your daddy for me.

[panting and whining]

I'll be praying for you guys.

be just fine.

Come here.

[Noah] Hello, guys.
[indistinct chatter]

[rainfall pattering]

I hope you're ready
for this tomorrow,

because you know
what they want, right?

They want the hero war dog
all sad and stoic,

just missing her
hero war daddy.

What they definitely
don't want...

They definitely don't want you
trying to eat everybody

as soon as the color guard
starts firing their salute.

Now, they...
They don't know you.

That's for damn sure.

They don't know
what it takes to be a hero.

The things you've done
to be a hero dog.

If they knew the truth,

it would scare the living shit
out of them.

You know, when I got out,

your daddy gave me
this shitty piece of plywood

with the word "Thanks"
carved in it. [chuckles]

It's like, what else
do you say to somebody

that you experience
what we experienced together?

You even listening to me?

Just talking to a dog.

[screeching]
[Lulu whining]

What is that?

No. No, no.

No, no. Come on.

Don't you do this to me now.

No.

Ow. [grunts]


Okay...
[whines]

Of course, there's no service.

Why would we have service?

[growls softly]

Hey, hey, hey.

Hello?

Hey.

Come on.

All right, we got to go.

Come on. We're moving on.
[thunder rumbling]

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Lulu barking]

Hey, hey, no.

No. Chill out.

[barking continues]
Hey. Hey, hey!

No! Stop! Relax!

Look, stop. It's just thunder.

It's just a thunderstorm.
We gotta... Stop.

Calm down. Stop!
[growls]

Hey!

All right, you want to go?
Come on. Come on, then.

Come on,
you're not gonna do shit.

Come on, then, let's go!

[barks, growling]


Such a coward.


[thunder rumbling]

[soft music playing]

Easy. I'm not gonna make you
go out there, okay?

How about we just chill out
for a little while?

Relax.

[thunder rumbles]
[whines]

Hey, it's okay.

It's just thunder
and a little lightning.

You know what? How about this?
Let me see if I can

give us a little something
to take our mind off.

Cross your paws.
Let's see if this thing works.

What do you feel like?

Who doesn't like
San Francisco?

You want to watch
your greatest hits,

or do you wanna watch...
Wanna watch Grey's?

I'm gonna go with Grey's.


We're just gonna rest,

we're gonna get
a little cozy, relax.

[TV playing indistinctly]

Watch a little trash TV.

A little snack 'cause
you can't watch trash TV

without a snack.

[thunder rumbling]

What?

Oh, you want some?


Who knew you just needed
to have a fight to get along?

Did Latin Shakespeare ever,

like, read you
his love letters?

Some pretty good ones
in there.

Let's see.

What about...

Okay. [chuckles]

"I woke for an instant when
I saw you covered in dirt.

You've taken bullets before.

This was the worst.

The guilt still haunts me.

I'm not going to lie,

but I know you did
what you did that night,

so none of your brothers
had to die."

It's pretty good.

"When they took you away,

I was sure
we'd run out of time

and that's when
it hit me, girl,

I was never your handler.

That you were actually mine.

Your brother, Riley."

You slept with Corrine?

Yeah.


with my sick daughter?

I cannot believe
you actually like this trash.

Unreal.

All right, the sun's up.

It's time.

There is about zero chance
of us making it

a hundred clicks in six hours

with no cell phone service
or ride.

But, hey, last time I checked,

"surrender"
is not a Ranger word.

["Hold On" playing]

I don't know about you,
but I got a funeral to go to.

Come on.

Come on.

â™ªâ™ª Bless my heart
Bless my soul â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª Didn't think I'd make it
To 22 years old â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª There must be
Someone up above â™ªâ™ª

Hey, hey, hey, hey!
â™ªâ™ª Saying "Come on, Brittany You got to come on up!" â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª You got to hold on â™ª

â™ªâ™ª Hey, you got to hold on â™ª

Hey.

Hey, hey, hey, please, please.
Come on.

Come on, please, please.
Come on! Man.

â™ªâ™ª So, bless my heart
And bless yours too â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª I don't know
Where I'm gonna go â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª Don't what I'm gonna do â™ª

[man 1 speaking Spanish]

â™ªâ™ª Must be somebody up above â™ª

[man 2 speaks indistinctly]

â™ªâ™ª Saying "Come on, Brittany
You got to come on up!" â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª You got to hold on â™ª

[conversing in Spanish]

â™ªâ™ª Yeah, you got to hold on â™ª

â™ªâ™ª Yeah, you got to wait! â™ª

â™ªâ™ª Yeah, you got to wait â™ª

â™ªâ™ª But I don't wanna wait â™ª

â™ªâ™ª Yeah, you got to wait â™ª

â™ªâ™ª But I don't wanna wait â™ª

â™ªâ™ª I don't wanna wait â™ª

We're gonna make it.

Come on.


Come on.

Almost there.

the Lord's love and peace.

You're gonna look great.

You're gonna look like a hero,

just like
Riley would've wanted.

[panting]
Okay.

You know what else
Riley would've liked?

You not to bite anybody,
so maybe just don't do that.

Come on.

Receive the Lord's blessings.

May the Lord bless you
and watch over you.

May He make His face
to shine upon

each and every one of you

and be gracious to you.

May He look lovingly on you

and grant you peace.
[Lulu whines]

May He bless your children

and your families...

[Lulu whines]
[Briggs shushing]

know love and happiness.

No, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

that love deeply.

[Briggs whispering
indistinctly]

be with you.

[Lulu barks]
We should not grieve for...

Lulu.

[Briggs shushing]
[Lulu continues barking]

[shushes, whispers]
Come on. It's okay.

[in normal voice] I'm sorry.

[barks and whines]

No, no, no. It's okay.

[panting]
Okay, fine, all right.

Okay, it's okay, go.

It's okay.

[crowd softly] Aw.

our dearly departed brother.

For he has stood
his last watch,

and he's now
on his final deployment.

In the name of the Father
and the Son

and the Holy Spirit. Amen.


Half right, face.

With blank ammunition, load!
[rifles cocking]

Ready!
[Briggs shushes]

Aim! Fire!
[Briggs shushing]

[gunshots]
[Briggs] Easy.

[officer] Aim!
[sushing]

[officer] Fire!
[gunshots]

You're okay, you're okay.
[officer] Aim! Fire!


[officer] Ready...
You're okay, you're okay.


Present Arms!

You're okay. You're okay.

[bugle blowing "Taps"]

On behalf of the President
of the United States,

the United States Army,
and a grateful nation.

[bugle stops blowing]



Come on, let's go.



Yep. Still on schedule
to drop her off

First thing in the A.M.
[Jones speaking indistinctly]

All right, I'll tell him
to expect your call.

Hey, and, Captain, thank you
for making this call.

I really appreciate it.
You got it, brother.

Oh, uh, one more thing.

Look, she's...
She's doing a lot better.

I mean, she's a completely
different dog now.

I don't know, maybe there's
someone on base

that one of us could talk to.

that's not up to us.

Just get it done.
[Briggs] Yeah.

Briggs.

Yes, sir.

All right.

[sighs deeply]


Let's go do something stupid.

Thank you, sir.

[slow instrumental
music playing]

You wanna go out there?

Hmm?

You see something
you wanna go get?

[chuckles softly]

You're free, go.

Go for it.
I ain't gonna try to stop you.

You hear me? Hey.

Hey.

Go.

Get out.
[whines and barks]

Go, come on. No. Hey.

No, I'm not trying to tell you
to do tricks, kid. No.

Get. Go.

Hey. [chuckling] Hey.

Now. Come on. Come on.

Hey. Hey.

You got no idea, do you, dog?

[high-pitched ringing]
[Briggs gasping]

[ringing continues]

[groaning softly]

[ringing continues]

[grunts, breathes heavily]

[ringing continues]
[breathing heavily]

[gasping rapidly]

[breathing heavily, gurgling]

[groans softly]

[breathing heavily]

[Lulu whining softly]

I'm okay.

I'm okay, girl.


[whines]
I'm okay. I'm okay.

I'm okay.

I'm okay.

[soft instrumental
music playing]

[whispering softly]
You're okay.

You're okay.

[door opens]

come on.

[door closes]

ID, sir?
Yeah.

Your army ID has expired.
[sighs]

You're required by law
to dispose...

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you.

Uh, I'm just dropping off
the dog, man,

uh, to a Corporal Levitz.

Hey, Levitz!

Do me a favor,
park right here.


Shit, man. You Rangers
ever hear of callin'?

I've been out here cooking
my ass off for an hour.

It could be worse.

You could be actually working.

I hear she's a real killer,

so just make sure
you muzzle her up good, okay?


Don't worry.

She ain't gonna be a problem.

Are you, girl?

Last time, okay? Last time.

Just gonna put it on
one more time.

[Lulu whining]

Hey, man,
she's been doing a lot better.

So just make sure the vet techs, you
know, reevaluate her, give her a chance.

they got their protocol.

You heard me. Make sure.

So as soon as we're done here,
you're gonna call Captain Jones, yeah?

That's what they're telling me.
What are you... Look, man, are you trying to piss her off?

[Lulu whining]

[sighs deeply]

All right. You're gonna
be okay, all right?

I ain't got all day, let's go.

put this on you.

[Lulu whining softly]


All right, let's go.

[Lulu whining]

[engine starts]

[Lulu barking in distance]

Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

[Lulu barking]
[Briggs] Come on.


[Lulu barking and whining]

God. Easy, easy, easy, easy.


[tires screech]

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

wait, wait, wait, wait.

Hi, hi, hi.
No. It's fine. It's fine.

My bad. I should have... You know
what, I should have put a vest on her.

She listens more
when the vest is on.

You know girls
and their fashion. [chuckles]

I'll be right back. Up!

Get there.

Sir, you forgot your ID.

Uh, you know what, man,
why don't you keep it?

Thank you for your service.

Hey, man, what about the dog?

What are you...
What are you looking at?

Let's not make this
all emotional, okay?

[Lulu whining]


I got the adoption papers
from the army today.

Riley would be so proud.


Maybe even of both of us.

Look, I'm no good
at this poem stuff,

so I'll just
get to the damn point.

Thanks.

Thanks for saving my life.
