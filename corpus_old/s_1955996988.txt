<i>Welcome back, hockey fans.</i>

<i>If you're just joining us,</i>
<i>we're broadcasting live</i>
<i>from the ZHL Draft,</i>

<i>here in beautiful
Anchorage, Alaska.</i>

For those of you at home,
keeping score,

<i>we've completed
the first 10 rounds.</i>

That's right.
And the deal-making
behind the scenes

<i>has been fast and furious.</i>

The general managers
for both,

<i>the LA Carjackers
and the Seattle Simians</i>

have just
brokered a deal.

<i>LA star center man
Rob Poirier has been traded</i>

<i>for the Seattle Simians'
first rounder,</i>

<i>Sergei Bubalochov.</i>

Along
with the trade for Poirier,
I would have to say, Bruce,

<i>that the Simians'
choices thus far</i>

<i>have been interesting,
to say the least.</i>

<i>Now,</i>
<i>another of the Simians'</i>
<i>new acquisitions</i>

<i>is goaltender
Max "Mad Dog" Brady</i>

<i>from the Sault Ste. Marie
Buccaneers.</i>

Mad Dog! Mad Dog! Mad Dog!

<i>Then,
there's Tyson Fowler.</i>

<i>Some of you</i>
<i>hardcore hockey fans</i>
<i>may not know his name</i>

<i>but he's actually</i>
<i>the reigning World</i>
<i>Figure Skating Champion.</i>

<i>Fowler surprised the</i>
<i>sports world by announcing his</i>
<i>retirement from figure skating</i>

<i>to pursue his</i>
<i>life-long dream of playing</i>
<i>professional hockey.</i>

<i>And don't forget
the Swedish sensation,</i>

<i>Olaf Schikedanz.</i>

Olaf! Olaf! Olaf!

<i>Well, certainly,</i>
<i>Seattle Simians will be an</i>
<i>interesting team to watch.</i>

<i>You're right there, Bruce.</i>

Jack? Louie?

Jack! Louie!

<i>And now we're going back
live to the draft.</i>

<i>- That's right, Clark.
Just in time, too.</i>

Bud Fulton,
the GM and owner of
the Seattle Simians,

<i>is about to make
his final pick.</i>

Hope you boys
aren't watching TV again.

Where are you two?

Jack! Louie!

<i>This player was
a scoring sensation</i>

<i>with the Junior B Nelson
Golden Nuggets.</i>

Hey!
<i>He led the</i>
<i>team to victory</i>

<i>in last year's Harvest
Cup Championship.</i>

Jack...

Louie...

You have until three
to open this door.

One...

Two...

Two and a half...

Two and three-quarters...

It is my distinct pleasure

<i>to announce
that the final pick</i>

for the Seattle Simians
in this year's ZHL Draft...

So this is where you
boys have been hiding.

...is

Jack.

Oh, come on!

Jack!

They mean you?

Are you sure this is what
you really wanna do?

Oh, Jack,
we're gonna miss you.

Jack? Welcome
to Seattle!

I'm Leo.

Coach sent me
to get you.

I think you're
gonna like Seattle.

Through there?

Ah, come in,
come in.

Ah! Ha-ha!

Leo! How's our
new player doing?

Mr. Fulton, Jack.

Jack, Mr. Fulton.

Pleased to meet you, Jack.
You can call me Bud.

Uh...

I think you're
gonna need this.

Welcome to the
Simians, Jack.

Now, Jack,
I wanna introduce you

to the rest of the players
and your coach.

All right!
Nice shot!

Hey, Coach!

Your new player
has arrived.

You mean mascot,
don't you?

Oh, no, no!
Jack's a real player.

Gentlemen, I'd like
to introduce you
to Jack.

Your new teammate.

Looks like
your girlfriend, Tony.

Gnarly.

Would you like a hotdog?

Jack's gonna be
wearing number 99

and a half.

Come on, Jack.
Let's get you suited up.

We're never gonna evolve
as a team with a monkey.

He can't be serious.
Look, it's Fulton's idea.

I have no intention
of playing him.

I'm not gonna be
made a fool of.

If he's on
the ice tonight,
I won't be.

You got it?

<i>Well, here we</i>
<i>are, back at the first ever</i>
<i>Seattle Simians game.</i>

Yes, and it's been
a disappointing game
so far, Bruce.

<i>Simians are down,
two to nothing.</i>

Come on, Simians!
Start playing hockey!

Get your popcorn,
peanuts here.

Bring back
the Zamboni driver.
Peanuts?

You guys stink!

<i>Well, the crowd
certainly isn't happy</i>

<i>after that last goal.</i>

<i>Here we go.
Face off at center ice,</i>

<i>Poirier wins the draw...</i>

Poor Jack,
he's still on the bench.

Oh, and that's
a picture-perfect goal!

Oh!

Let's go, guys!

Come on, get the lead out,
you losers!

Way to work, boys.
Way to work.
I like it.

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Give me that.

Miller.
<i>- Miller.</i>

Fans look unhappy.

Bad business to have
unhappy fans.

It's only
the first game.

I can see the
headlines already.

Put Jack in.

You gotta
be kidding.

And that's an order.

Hey, Coach. What,
are you ordering fries?

Jack.

You're up.

<i>Wow!</i>
<i>I can't believe it!</i>
They're putting him on!

<i>It looks like Miller</i>
<i>is sending Jack</i>
<i>onto the ice!</i>

Miller!
Didn't know your kid
could play hockey!

Hey, look,
they're putting in Jack.

Hey, over there!
Look, look!

Hey, your player
needs a shave!

He's on?

He looks like
a real swinger, this one.

Is that a monkey?

I told you,
I'm not gonna be on
the ice with a monkey.

It's Fulton's call.

Let's show them, huh?

You can do it, Jack!

Hey, somebody
paint the puck yellow.

He'll think it's a banana.

Hey, little monkey!

Jack, I'm open!

He scored!

<i>Jack
fed Fowler a beautiful pass</i>

<i>reminiscent of a close
relative, number 99.</i>

All right, Carjackers.
Enough monkeying around.

Let's show these Simians
who's in charge of the ice.

Guy's good.

Jack,
pass me the puck!

<i>Jack passes it
out front to Schikedanz,</i>

<i>shoots and scores!</i>

Yay! We scored!

I'm out of here.

<i>And here come
the Simians again,</i>

<i>Jack's got the puck,</i>
<i>moving up ice</i>
<i>to Fowler now...</i>

<i>And what</i>
<i>the heck is Fowler</i>
<i>doing out there?</i>

<i>I think it was
a double-axle, Bruce.</i>

Somebody hit
fancy feet!

<i>And that's
three assists for Jack.</i>

<i>He is putting on
quite a show!</i>

Ha-ha, sorry,
I didn't mean that.

Jack, happy birthday.

I got ya.

Oh, you.

<i>He shoots.
He scores!</i>

<i>Right at the buzzer,
and the Simians win!</i>

Ah! Champagne!
Champagne!

You guys
think it's okay

to be beaten
by a chimp?

'Cause I
sure as heck don't!

Nice game,
guys, nice game!

One question.
Excuse me, guys.
Out of my way.

Hey, Poirier,
did you leave the ice early
tonight because of Jack?

Well, let me ask you.
Would you play
with a monkey?

<i>Well, I think</i>
<i>it'll be a great first</i>
<i>season for the Simians.</i>

We've assembled
an excellent team
to the draft,

and we have
a very effective
secret weapon.

Jack, pass me the puck.
Come on, I'm open!

I'm not open anymore.
Let's get that monkey.

Jack, look out!

He's okay!

High five!

Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah!

Do I have any lice?

Does Jack do shiatsu?

Jack can hear him call that?

That was me.
Bananas, man.

<i>Poirier is on net
with a breakaway.</i>

<i>He spins, goes the
back way...</i>

<i>Oh! Oh! It's
off the post.</i>

Excuse me, guys,
get out of the way.

Forget about it, guys.
It's just Poirier.

See if we can get
a reaction out of this guy.

Hey! Number 11!

Hey. Rob Poirier.

Well, Rob,
did you ever think

you'd get, uh,
chumped by a chimp?

<i>â™ª I'm all smiles...</i>

Another
chocolate?

Sure.
Make it a double.

<i>â™ª I don't need... â™ª</i>

Hey, excuse me,
are you one of
the Simians?

Well, we were wondering
if you could get

Jack to autograph
something for us.

You have a king?

Go fish.

Do you have
an ace?

Sorry.

You know,
I gotta tell you, Clark,

<i>I have not seen hockey</i>
<i>fans this excited about</i>
<i>a player.</i>

<i>Jack's popularity
has not stopped rising.</i>

Daddy misses
you too, sweetheart.

Good night.

This your family?

Guess I never
thought about a chimp
having a family before.

Hey, Jack,
what are you
up to tonight?

Two chocolate shakes
with cherries.

Thanks.

I'm hoping I get traded back
to Los Angeles next year.

So I can be
with my family.

Hey, kids.

You wanna meet Jack?

Oh, dude,
that's awesome!

Thanks.
Sweet.

Yeah!

Get your bananas here!

We got fresh
bananas here!

Sorry.

Over here!
Over here! Yeah!

Okay, Jack,
so now that we have
the quad down,

let's try a sit-spin.

I'm doing it,
Fowler, look at me,
I'm spinning.

How's it going, Fowler?
Well, that's a start.

Come on, Olaf!
Fowler, I can't
see anymore!

The whole wide world
is spinning, Fowler!

Jack! Jack! Jack!

Yeah! Jack!

What are you doing?
Pass me the puck!

You don't see that often!

Find your focus.
Find your focus.
Okay.

Fowler, I'm fine now.
There you go.

<i>Well, here it is,</i>
<i>Clark, the last game</i>
<i>of the season</i>

before playoff time.

<i>Yes, siree.</i>

<i>Coach Skinner
has to be wondering</i>

<i>what his team has to do
to beat Jack and the Simians.</i>

<i>I mean, Seattle's won
all four games this season.</i>

<i>Jack</i>
<i>comes around the net,</i>
<i>he shoots, scores!</i>

<i>And the Simians take
the one-nothing lead.</i>

<i>I'm telling you, Bruce,</i>

<i>Jack definitely has
the Carjackers' number.</i>

Knox.
Hmm.

It's time to
end this folly.

No problem.

You remember the plan?

Yeah. Get the monkey
into the net, and, uh...

And then pull
the net over you

so the ref can't see
what you're doing.

Yeah, yeah,
I got it.

Let's go, Jack.

Go get him!
Come on!
Yeah!

Come on, Jack.
Put it there.

Go, Knoxy!

Jack! Watch out!

Jack!

Jack!

Yes!

Jack!

Ouch!

What's going on?

He bit me!
The chimp bit me!

The chimp bit my player!

What happened?
He bit me. Jack.

If it wasn't
for this glove, I would
have lost my hand.

Well, Miller, it seems
that your little mascot

has just bitten
my player.

What are you
talking about?

I want this animal
thrown out of the game.

You gotta
be kidding. Ref?

Number 99
and a half?

You're out
of the game.

Oh!

Come on, Knox.
Let's make sure your
hand's okay.

Tell us
what happened.

I didn't actually
see it.

Jack.

Jack, I think it's
better if you wait in
the dressing room.

We'll be having
a full inquiry
into this investigation.

Thank you very much, ladies
and gentlemen, for coming.

That monkey
is an animal.

He bit my player.
What's he gonna
do next?

Take off a head? Huh?

The ZHL should've
never let a chimp play
in the first place.

What
is the ZHL's policy?

They should
kick him out of the league.

You wouldn't have
anything to do with this,
would you, Skinner?

Are you accusing me?

Are you accusing me
of setting up a monkey?
Are you crazy?

I'm reporting you!
I'm reporting you!

Coach Miller,
what are your thoughts
on the Jack incident?

I'm not gonna
make any comment

until there has been
a proper enquiry.

Oh, come on,
Miller, stop dodging
the question.

Look, I've been assured
by Commissioner Pasquela

that the ZHL is gonna
launch a proper and
full investigation.

But, I'll tell you this.
If Jack did bite that player,

the Simians will take
all the appropriate actions.

Where is Jack?

Something smells fishy to me.

Jack?

Jack!

Jack?
Jack?

Jack!
Come on, Olaf.
Hurry up.

Go that way.

Jack!

Jack!

Jack!
Jack!

I don't know.

You go that way.
I'll go this way.
All right.

We'll find him.
Jack!

Hello, Ben,
it's you.

Important job today.

You get to work
for the cops!

Hot off the presses!

The cops are
looking for him?

He bit some
hockey player.

Is he dangerous?

He's a hockey player!

Go on, get them
posters up!

I'll cough up
another $3

if you get them
all posted by 5:00.

Thanks, Mr. Raheja.

We're not open yet!

Um, excuse me.

I'm with the Department
of Child Services.

I don't have any children.

Can I talk to you
for a minute?

Sorry to bother you,

but I'm looking
for a young boy.

What did he do?
He's a runaway.

He ran away
from a foster home.

Unfortunately, his mother
died a year ago.

They tell me he loves
to skateboard.

Are you sure you
haven't seen him?
His name is Ben.

What are you gonna do
when you find him?

Well, unfortunately,
at his age,

few children are adopted,
so I'll have to find him
another foster home.

If I see him,
I'll give you a call.

Oh, thank you,
Mister... Uh...

Plant. Oliver Plant.
Mr. Plant.

I'll just leave
you my card.

Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Dad!

Hey, Suzanne.
Careful!

Oh, I'm starving.
Thanks, Nick.

Ketchup?

Can I get a dog?
All right.

Hey, kid!

Didn't you
see the sign?

I don't know
what it means.

No posters.

Oh, I'm sorry.

How come you're
not in school?

We just moved
here from Alaska.

I'm starting school
next week.

Alaska, huh?

There's my mom now.
Gotta go.

Hey, hey! Wai...

Oh, no!

Jack's missing!

<i>Unfortunately, Julie,</i>
<i>the police have</i>
<i>no leads so far.</i>

<i>But we were looking
for Jack all day.</i>

We'll go back out
after the game.

Call me when
you hear something.

Yeah, I'm sure
we'll find him soon.

Okay.

Okay!

What do you think?

Awesome.
Yeah?

You'll probably need
a couple of these.

I'll be closing up
five minutes.

Okay.

So, you want this
on your sponsor account?

Yeah.
Thanks, Ollie.
Oh, no. Thank you!

Good choice!

That's my favorite.
I'll give it to you
for 50 bucks.

Thanks.
Can't afford it.

Are you going?
Huh?

We'll be at
the competition.

Neil won last year.

So, Neil, if
you're not gonna be
using this board,

I'm just gonna
throw it out back
in the dumpster.

All right.

What the...

What the...
What the heck's goin' on?

Jeez.

I've got to find
another alley.

And he 5-0s the ramp,

fakie rocks the spine,

and ollies to flat.

The crowd goes wild.

Yeah!

Night, Mom. Love you.

So, do you
want to try it?

Come on!
Right over here.
Do it here.

Nice and slow.
You got it.
You got it.

Keep your balance.

We'll have this roll-in
done in no time.

Perfect.

We should get you
your own skateboard.

Shh.

Don't worry.
This isn't stealing.

This is old stuff
that they've thrown away.

Just need
one more wheel.

Hello?

I got it!

Let's get out of here!

How's this?

This is you, isn't it?

Looks like,
you're wanted.

You don't seem dangerous.

I know what it's like
to have people looking
for you for no reason.

I won't tell anyone.

Come on, Jack!

<i>And there you go.
Three-one the final score.</i>

<i>Yupper dupper, Bruce.</i>

<i>Oh, ladies</i>
<i>and gentleman,</i>
<i>unexpectedly, uh,</i>

<i>Bud Fulton has joined us
in the studio.</i>

<i>- Bud?
Hello.</i>

It's been some time since
Jack's gone missing, and

we at the Seattle Simians
would like nothing more than
to see him returned home.

If you have any information
regarding the whereabouts
of Jack,

<i>please contact the Simians
immediately.</i>

We're never gonna
find Jack this way.
It's been days!

We're not gonna give up
until we find Jack.

Okay, let's go
this way.

Hey!
Hey, hang in there.

Hey, guys.

What, still?

Has no one seen him?

Not yet.

Hopefully, someone will
see one of the posters
and call.

<i>We are done with
our road trip now,</i>

<i>so we'll start looking
ourselves again.</i>

I understand.

Call us when you
hear something.

Even if it's in
the middle of the night.

We'll keep you posted.

He hasn't
come back yet.

It'll be okay.

Louie?

<i>Louie?</i>

<i>â™ª Well, it's just
a little rain in my heart</i>

<i>â™ª Even though it's sunny</i>

Come on in!

<i>â™ª I ain't laughing</i>

Can't stand to see a young
fellow out in the rain
like this.

I'm heading
all the way
up to Nelson.

Canada.

So you just give me a holler
when you want out, eh?

It's gonna be
a long drive,

so sit back
and buckle up.

<i>â™ª ...getting back
together again</i>

<i>â™ª Well, it's just
a little rain in my heart â™ª</i>

Listen, I'll be gone
for a few hours.

I gotta make
us some money.

Don't worry.

I'll be back.

There you are, Ben.

Put on your late pants?

I was expecting you
an hour ago.

Sorry, Mr. Raheja.

All right.

Hang on.

This one's
right up your alley.

Skateboarding competition.

There you go.

There's a $5.00 bonus
for you, Ben.

<i>â™ª Here we go</i>

<i>â™ª It's good to finally
be back on the road again</i>

<i>â™ª Where I see with both eyes</i>

<i>â™ª When I'm lost I'm gonna feel
my eyes close shut again</i>

<i>â™ª And I'll yell to the sky</i>

<i>â™ª If you want
to take this ride</i>

<i>â™ª Then you need to
get in line</i>

<i>â™ª And you're wondering
why your life's a bore</i>

<i>â™ª Better hold on tight</i>

<i>â™ª It's good to finally
be back on the road again</i>

<i>â™ª I'm okay with my life</i>

<i>â™ª When I'm lost I'm gonna feel
my eyes close shut again</i>

<i>â™ª And I'll yell to the sky</i>

<i>â™ª If you want to
take this ride</i>

<i>â™ª Then you need
to get in line</i>

<i>â™ª And you're wondering
why your life's a bore</i>

<i>â™ª Better hold on tight</i>

Hey, Jack!

<i>â™ª Whoa</i>

<i>â™ª Whoa</i>

Jack.

Are you okay?

You're crazy.

<i>â™ª Whoa â™ª</i>

This is one big competition.

If I win this,
I get sponsored,

and then we can
get our own place.

Huh?

What the...

Uh...

Come on, Jack.
Try this!

Ow.

What the...

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hadn't you ought to be
in school by now?

My mom...

She decided
to homeschool me.

Gotta go!

Homeschool?

So, that's
where you go.

<i>â™ª Pack my bags
I'm hitting the road again</i>

<i>â™ª I'm headed
far away from here</i>

<i>â™ª I'm circling back
by the old railroad track...</i>

Darn.

Sorry about that.

I'll keep my eyes
on the road.

Doc says
I need these glasses,

but I don't like 'em.

Heck, I've been driving
this road for 40 years.

In fact, I told him
I could do it blind...

If I had to.

<i>â™ª I'm hitting
the road again â™ª</i>

Right this way, ma'am.
Be careful.

Wow. I never knew
this was here.

It's cool.

Let's go
check out that shack
over there.

Oh, yeah.
Good idea.

Phew.

Go ahead.

Wow. Would you look
at this?

Hey.

Hmm.
Looks like we found him.

It sure does.

Skate park.

All right.

And...
That should do it.
Here we go.

It's fine.
It's fine.

We can't wait around
here all day.

He's bound to show up
eventually.

You'll alert me
when he shows up?

Believe me. No problem.
This place'll
be under 24-hour watch.

They found us, Jack.

They're gonna separate us.

They'll make us go back.

Now, what are
we gonna do?

I was gonna enter
that competition tomorrow.

I was gonna get sponsors

so I could take
care of us, Jack.

Thanks, Jack.

But I can't use this.

There's no pop in it.

I won't be able
to do the tricks.

Jack! What are you doing?

Jack?

Jack! Wait up!

Jack!

Jack, what are
we doing here?

No one would throw out
a good enough board
for the competition.

You're gonna
like that board.

All right, Ollie.
That's great.
Thank you.

Thanks, man.
Thanks.

Yeah.

Jack, we gotta
get out of here.

Well, hello there.

Uh... I was
just looking
for something.

In my dumpster?

I... I'd better go.

Oh, no, hold on.
Wait a minute.

Wait a minute.
Come here.

Just tell me
what's going on.

Well, I broke
my board.

No kidding.

And I was gonna
enter this
competition...

But I can't
afford a
new board.

Why don't you
show me what
you can do?

Show me
what you got.

I don't have
a board.

Oh, yeah.
Hold on
a second.

Don't go anywhere.

How about this?
Will this work?

Sure, I guess.

This board's great.

Would you like to use
that board in the
competition tomorrow?

Seriously?

Holy Toledo! That's
a monkey! It's an ape!

Oh, that's Jack.
He's a friend.

So where are you
living, then?

At the old pool.

All by yourself?

Oh, no.
Jack lives with me,

but everybody's
after him.

They think
he's dangerous.

Well, you know,
it's getting a
little late,

and maybe we can
talk some more
in the morning.

Why don't you
guys bunk out
upstairs in the loft?

Good night, Ben.
Good night.

How did Ollie
know my name?

Jack, we gotta
get out of here.

What if he calls
the cops in
the morning?

We gotta go now.

If you think we
should stay,
I'll stay.

Night, Mom.
Love you.

Night, Jack.
Love you.

<i>Hello?</i>

Hello, Barbara?
<i>Yes.</i>

Yes, this is
Oliver Plant.
<i>Mr. Plant.</i>

Yes. Plant. Oliver.

Um...
<i>What's up?</i>

I think I know
where Ben is.

<i>â™ª Hey, buddy,
don't you worry about me</i>

<i>â™ª I'm as cool behind the wheel</i>

<i>â™ª As anybody can be â™ª</i>

Morning, Jack.

Do you want to whip
up some pancakes?

How do pancakes sound?

Jack, what a mess!

Want to use
my razor?

Looks like you
might need
a shave, too.

I'll wait for
you right here

in case you
need something.

Hey, look who it is!

Jack?
Little dude!

Jack! Where you been?

It's Jack!
Oh, man,
he looks great!

Jack, where'd you get
those boots?

Hey! Hey!

Cool boots, Jack.

You got gum too...
What's all the
commotion?

Hey, Coach,
can Jack play?

Come on, Coach.

Get Jack ready
for the warm-ups.

All right,
let's go, Simians!

Go Simians!
Come on, Simians.

Jack is back.

Let's go, Jack.

Jack?

What's wrong
with Jack?

Are you okay?

Is Jack all right?

That's all
right, Jack.

Just a little rusty.

Yeah, skate
like Russki.

Come on, Jack.
Let's get 'em.

I think he had
a bad banana.

Jack? Jack!

Are you sure
you're all right?

What's all that
commotion
on the ice?

Is that Jack?

Come here.
Come on.
I'll help you.

Jack. Jack,
stop with
the stick.

Hey, Olaf, I'm
a little concerned
about Jack.

Have you noticed
the way he's skating?
Yeah.

And the way he's
holding his stick?

Jack no good.

Hey, Jack.
Looking good.

Come on, Jack.
We'll eat some
snow off the ice.

It'll make us feel
good. Come on.

Don't get your lips
stuck to the ground.

Come on now.

Ready?

Maybe come in
a little bit closer.

Okay, there you go.
All right.

Show us
what you got!

Remember that
one, Jack?

Stay down on
your knees,
stay strong.

Come on, Jack,
we're starting
real simple here.

We're on two feet,
remember? Just...

Jack, I don't
want to eat
anymore snow.

Quit pushing my
face into the thing.

I don't want any
more snow! No, Jack,
no! No, no, Jack!

Let's go, boys.

I smell victory.

Hey, ref.

What's up,
Skinner?

That's Jack.

What's he doing
out there?

The ZHL has
already banned him.

I'll check it out.

Yeah, you do that.
You check it out.

This is Mandy
Parker coming to
you from Seattle

with the regional
qualifying trials

for skateboarding's
national championships.

This is the first step

for some of the
hottest young talent

on the skateboarding
scene,

and we expect
the competition this
year to be fierce.

The winner will receive
$1,000 in prize money

and a trip to
the nationals

to compete against
the best boarders
in the nation.

Well, why don't
you go up
and sign in?

Go.

We just need
to get your

parent or guardian
to sign this form

if you want
to enter
the contest.

Uh, they're
not here.

Sorry, bud.

Is there a
problem?

Uh, are you
his father?

Uh, no.

Why don't you take
Jack and grab
us some seats?

Jack, these
guys are good.

This is a hard
competition.

Our next skater up
is Luke Gilbert.

<i>â™ª These heads are rolling
they see black</i>

<i>â™ª Watch them
smile the dust away</i>

Okay, you're in.

I am? But they
said that I
wasn't allowed to.

I signed
the papers.

Oh, thanks, Ollie.

<i>â™ª Take note and dot
the dot tonight â™ª</i>

Okay, what
now, Skinner?

That monkey
is back.

He bit my player.
You know that.

I want him
off the ice.

What's going on
here, huh?

Look, coach.
Jack can hardly
skate now.

Aw, forget it.
You can have
your monkey.

We'll take the cup.

Look,
it's Jack!

Okay, then,
let's get this
game underway.

Thank you.

Next up,
Sammy Rogers.
Now, Sammy is

the only girl at this
year's competition,

and word has it she can
ride with the best of them.

Ollies over the
roll-in. Very cool.

Oh, she has some
awesome moves!

Stiff competition.

Oh, yeah. Girl power is
definitely alive and well

at this year's
competition.

Sammy's sending out
a message to the boys

that she means business.

Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

They started
already.

Oh, come on, let's
go. This way.

Excuse us. Excuse us.
Coming through.

Next up is
Neil Nellis.

Now, Neil is our defending
state champion,

and he's looking to
make it two in a row.

He starts with
a fakie hand and
a fakie rock.

Backside and
over the channel.

That boy likes to fly.

<i>â™ª Hey, I know</i>

<i>â™ª That I can't talk
to you right now â™ª</i>

Ooh, and he falls on the
kick-flip over the channel.

Now there's
room for our

final skater to
make his move.

Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.

Oh, it's a
good view.

We gotta see them
here for sure.

And our final
competitor for the day
will be Ben Johnson.

Me?

Yeah, that's you.

Okay.

You can do it!

Hey, Mike,
can I get some duct
tape over here?

Whenever you're
ready, Ben.

Jack, what are
you doing?

I can't do this.

Wait a minute.

There's somebody
else up there with him.

I think it's
a monkey.

Hey, look!

Dude,
it's a monkey!

<i>â™ª Here we go</i>

That's the chimp
we've been
looking for!

That's the
boy, Ben!

<i>â™ª It's good to finally be
back on the road again</i>

<i>â™ª Where I see with both eyes</i>

<i>â™ª When I lose my way I feel
my eyes close shut again</i>

<i>â™ª And I'll yell to the sky</i>

These two are putting
on quite a double run.

This competition
has just gotten wild.

<i>â™ª Better hold on tight</i>

Yes!

The chimp has
kicked out, and Ben's
ripping it on his own.

<i>â™ª When I'm lost, you know
I feel my eyes go shut again</i>

<i>â™ª And I'll yell to the sky</i>

<i>â™ª If you want to
take this ride</i>

<i>â™ª Then you need
to get in line</i>

<i>â™ª And you're wondering
why your life's a bore</i>

<i>â™ª Better hold on tight â™ª</i>

All right!

What an amazing run
by Ben Johnson.

This crowd is going
crazy with excitement.

We did it, Jack.

That
was super slick.

We did it, Jack!

<i>We've got
less than 20 seconds left</i>

<i>in the second period,</i>
<i>and the game is all</i>
<i>tied one to one.</i>

<i>Here comes
Bubalochov in on Naddy.</i>

<i>Undresses Schikedanz.
The clock's winding down now.</i>

<i>He shoots, he scores!
Oh, what a beautiful goal!</i>

<i>Mad Dog Brady
never had a chance.</i>

<i>That ends
the second period</i>

<i>with the Carjackers
leading two to one.</i>

I just can't understand
why the Simians

<i>have not played</i>
<i>Jack at all in the</i>
<i>first two periods.</i>

You know, he
looked pretty rusty
during the warm-up.

Maybe he's got
to get his
ice legs back.

That's all right, Jack.
You'll get it back.

You're just a little
out of practice.

Yeah, you just
lost 40 pounds.

That's got to be
hard on the body.

Would you like
a hot dog?

Hot dogs are good for you.

They're full of
vitamins A, vitamin D,

vitamin C, vitamin E,
calcium...

And to announce
this year's winner,

please welcome
skateboarding champion
Bob Burnquist.

Thank you, Mandy.
Hello, everyone.

Wow, we saw
some great lines

from some awesome
skateboarders today.

Third place is gonna
go to Sammy Rogers.

All right,
Sammy.

Congratulations.
Thanks.

Second place
is gonna go
to Neil Nellis.

All right,
Neil.

Congrats.

Now, choosing
this year's winner

was a tough
decision but I
think our judges

did a great job,
and our winner is...

Ben Johnson.

Come on up,
Ben. Good job.

Good job.

Everyone,
let's give it up for
this year's winner,

Ben Johnson!

Ben! Ben!

Good job, buddy.

Ben! Ben!
No, no, no. Wait.

Ben, it's okay.
I just want to
talk to you.

I don't want
to go back.
But now, Ben

you know, I've
been thinking.

My place is
pretty empty

and I thought

you might perhaps
consider living with me.

Do you mean it?
You bet I do.

All right!

All right,
listen, folks,

I'm afraid I have
to take this
chimpanzee with me.

Jack didn't
do anything.
Oh, I know that.

He's got a hockey
game to play.

The Simians are
down two to one.

You mean you're not
gonna lock him up?

Lock him up?
Are you kidding?

Oh, this little
guy's no criminal.

Why, he's the
best thing to
happen to the ZHL

since the
Zamboni machine.

Well, I guess
you gotta go, Jack,

but we'll catch
up to you.

Yeah, Jack,
go on ahead.

You're not gonna
get rid of
us that easily.

Yo, Ben, good
job on the
ramp today, man.

Tell you what,

after seeing you
skate today, I want
to sponsor you.

Whoa!

Why don't you and
I go for a victory
session right now?

Right now?
Yeah, man, come on.

It's always
time to skate.

Whoa!

Come on.
Ready, Jack?

Come on, let's go.
Straight ahead.

There you
go. I'll see
you out there.

Jack?

Huh?

Huh?

Jack?

What?
Huh? What?

This explains it.

You're Jack?

And you're
Louie?

You're brothers.

Okay, men, we've got a
"chimpionship" to win.

Jack, put
your gear on.

All right, let's do it.

Hey, great news.
We found Jack.

<i>Oh, and Louie's
here, too.</i>

Oh, great.

I'm gonna go
tell Lulu and
all the others.

<i>They're gonna
be thrilled.</i>

<i>All right, here</i>
<i>we go. The Simians</i>
<i>are back on the ice.</i>

Well, it's been
an incredible
game so far.

I'll tell you, LA
is leading two to one.

<i>If the Simians want</i>
<i>to have a</i>
<i>chance at the cup,</i>

<i>they've got
to score early.</i>

<i>That's right, Clark,
even with Jack back.</i>

<i>Fans are</i>
<i>on their feet</i>
<i>here in Seattle,</i>

<i>urging on their Simians.</i>

<i>Here's a
shot for the point.</i>

<i>Poirier passes the
puck down to the net.</i>

<i>Pass that puck to Jack.
Jack shoots, scores!</i>

Yeah!

<i>We got a
tie hockey game!</i>

Yes! Whoo!

Watch out!

Ahhh!

<i>Bubalochov's</i>
<i>in on net. He</i>
<i>shoots and scores!</i>

<i>The Carjackers
take back the lead.</i>

Come on,
ref, I hardly
touched the guy.

Go for it,
fella, go!

Jack, I'm open.

Let's go, man.

Yeah!

Yeah!

Boy, what an exciting
game we got going
here tonight, Clark.

<i>With just over a</i>
<i>minute to go in</i>
<i>the third period,</i>

<i>the score is tied
three-three.</i>

<i>And I'll
tell you, folks,</i>

<i>Jack has really
pulled it together.</i>

<i>Bubalochov, a shot,
and it's saved by Brady.</i>

<i>That could have been
the game saver, Bruce.</i>

<i>Boy, you
could cut the tension</i>

<i>with a knife in
here, Clark.</i>

<i>Only 20 seconds
left on the clock.</i>

<i>We're tied up at three.</i>

<i>Looks like we'll
be going into overtime.</i>

Go, go, go, go.

<i>Ho, ho, what a move!</i>

Go, Jack!

Shoot!

Shoot!

Shoot, Jack!

Jack scored!

Yeah, Jack!

Yeah!

Yeah, it's good!

Yes!

Seattle has won the cup!

Ooh, I'm gonna get
that little monkey.

Not sorry.

Yeah! Ha, ha, ha!
All right, guys!

Well, there it is.
It's now official.

<i>Jack has been
named the MVP</i>

<i>for this year's
ZHL cup final.</i>

Yeah!

Jack! Jack! Jack!

Here, Louie.
I put this together

so you can
learn how to
skate like Jack.

Bye, Jack.
I'll miss you.

Goodbye, Jack.

Take care, Jack.

Rock on, Jack-o.

Jack and Louie,
don't forget friend.

Bye, Jack.

Come on, Ben.
Let's go home.

I'm gonna miss
them furry
little fellas.
