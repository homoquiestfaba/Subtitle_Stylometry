<i>[Alarm Blaring]</i>


Why should I trust an American?

You killed my wife,
my two daughters,

my son, my father in an air raid.

Well, that wasn't me, old buddy.
I'm just here to make a living.

A case of mistaken identity
right there.

Here's the program.
You hand it to this guy in dubai.

Then he gives you
half a million dollars.

No wire transfers,
no bank files,

no paper trail.

<i>Everybody gets rich.</i>

Granny's still out there
on the porch sipping a lemonade.

No deal.

What do you say?

There's half a mil
looking at you right there.

I'm just a one-man relief agency here.
You guys don't want to play ball.

I know what you really want.

<i>[Gunshot]</i>

Come on.

Come on.

Where are ya?

Stop. Walid. Stop.
[Speaks Foreign Language]

Walid.

Drop your weapon.

<i>Come on. Don't be stupid.</i>

<i>Turn around.
Drop your weapon, Walid.</i>

Drop it!

Drop it.

I know why you are here.

<i>[Walid Panting]
Walid.</i>

God is great.

Stupid.

<i>[ Dog Barking In Distance]</i>

<i>[Woman Screams]
No.! No.!</i>

Don't.
Ah, there you go, Mom. Whoo!

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

What are you? Cra...
It's disgusting. Get out.

<i>- Get...
[Phone Rings]</i>

<i>Get out! You freak.
Jump in.</i>

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

Hello.

<i>I need to know what you're wearing.</i>

What am I wearing?
Sweaty T-shirt and jeans.

Old sweater.

Hey. How'd the move go?

You know.
It... It's done anyway.

One of the trucks didn't show up,
and they broke the legs off
my poor old console table.

You're kidding.
Yeah, I couldn't find the key
to get in when we got here.

Oh.
But we're in.

<i>That's good.
How was your day?</i>

Mmm, interesting.

<i>Good interesting or ''run screaming
out of there with your hair standing up
on your head''interesting?</i>

A little bit of both.

<i>- How's the kid?
New school, new house,
new friends to make.</i>

<i>He misses L.A.
He misses his girlfriend.</i>

Ah.
I wouldn't buy him a pair of
hundred-dollar sneakers.

You're not here.

<i>[Men Chattering]</i>

How are you doing, sweetie?

I miss you, you know.
But I'm hanging in.

<i>Hey, Mike.
Found our guy.</i>

Mike?

<i>Fazal.
Okay. Hey, babe,
I'm right here.</i>

Uh, listen, I'm gonna...

I'll call you in a bit.
Okay, I gotta go.

Call me later?
All right, babe.

Okay.
Love you. Bye.
Bye. Bye.

Hey. Tyler, I'm getting you a towel,
and you're getting out.
Whoo!

<i>[Screams]

<i>You're dead.</i>

Stop the winch!
Stop the winch!

<i>Wayne, look at this.</i>

Get belowdecks.
Get the hell below.

<i>[Man]
Moving house is the number two cause
of mental breakdowns after bereavement.</i>

<i>[Mike]
Oh, is that right?</i>

<i>Number three is what we're doing...
chasing a low-level player
all over the boonies...</i>

<i>when we could let
his own people handle him.</i>

Let me do this my way. Okay?

Guys, stay alert.

<i>[ Chattering In Foreign Language]</i>

[Chattering Continues]

<i>[Mike]
Whoa. Whoa.</i>

[Foreign Language]

[Foreign Language]
I don't understand. What?

He killed my brother.
Ah. Okay, you speak English.

He killed my brother,
and he hang him upside down
and he cut his, uh, belly.

<i>[Man Speaking Foreign Language]</i>

Okay. There's a better way
to do this.

This is my way. Move.
Okay.

Just let me have this one.
Just one. This guy.

[Foreign Language]

<i>No.</i>

[Foreign Language]

You want him, you go through me.
Let's go, Fazal.
Please.

Keep your mouth shut.
I can save your ass.

Go, go. Up, up. Come on.

<i>Everybody move.</i>

In the truck.
Everybody in.

<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

<i>[Foreign Language]</i>

<i>Nice move, Mike.
[Machine Guns Firing]</i>

Give me a heads-up next time?

<i>[ Chattering]</i>

<i>Understand I want him
to keep his mouth shut.
Just tell him to be quiet.</i>

<i>[Wayne]
I know that.
What do you suggest?</i>

You okay?
Yeah.

So, what are we gonna do?

Never mind about that.
Go inside. Keep warm.
Make some coffee or somethin'. Go on.

Three.

Some change, man?

<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

<i>[Man]
''I'm sorry''? That's all he can say?
''I'm sorry''?</i>

These people will be gone in a week.
The mayor... Have you heard of
creative development?

We've been with
your institution for 35 years.

Okay, fine.
You can talk to my lawyer.

They foreclosed on us.

They... They can't do that.
We've sold 15 units.

That still leaves
most of the units unsold,

and we haven't got the cash
to complete the renovation.

One more month.
They gotta give us
just one more month.

<i>That's it, Ben. It's over.
It's not our building anymore.</i>

The bank owns our asses.

Damn it!

I can't believe it.
Just one more month.

What are you gonna do now?

[Car Alarm Chirps]

<i>[Man]
Wranglers.</i>

Levis.
Do you have licensing agreements
for those, dad?

Well, they got the labels
on them, don't they?

How's business?
Oh, you'd be proud of me.

I proved you can lose money
in real estate.

How much?

Round figures?
Round figures, square figures...
whatever.

Everything.

So, I guess an M.B.A. From Wharton
doesn't make you any smarter
than the old man, huh?

You can...
You can start with these.

Catch you later.


We're not here because we want to
mess with your country.

You can keep it, pal.

You want to live in the Middle Ages
and eat a lot of goat and keep your women
tied up in sacks, you go right ahead.

That's your privilege.
We just want to stop you
from messing with ours.

All right.

Fazal, why don't we do a little recap?

We know that you
and your dead pal, Walid, run...

a major supply route
right into the States.

<i>Now, you can either
cut a deal with us if you want to,
or we could...</i>

toss you back out there
to your old buddies...

and let them bounce
rocks off of your head.

Please.

We need to clear out this garbage,
sell these machines,
take the write-down.

Who's gonna buy 'em?
We couldn't give 'em away.

We'd have to hire somebody
to haul 'em off as scrap.

We don't make anything
here anymore.

We design it, but it's...
it's cut and fit together
someplace else.

Then we stick the label on it
and ship it off to the retailer.
That's all.

It's called ''globalization.''
They never taught you that at school?

Anyway, here,
we got a real problem.

<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

<i>I got 30,000 linen shirts coming
from Shanghai for the Shirt Palace.</i>

Six buttons, tab collars,
twin pleat, square cut.

Only problem is
nobody seems to know
where they are.

Could be a shipping problem.

Could be a Customs problem.

But I know a guy.

You always did.

<i>[ Chattering]</i>

<i>[ Cell Phone Rings]</i>

<i>[Man]
You kiddin'me?
This fool drives an Acura.</i>

<i>So, I say,
''Okay, come back over to my garage,
you check out my Porsche. ''</i>

<i>- All right?
[Man #2] Get out of my way.</i>

<i>- How you doin'?
What can I do for you?</i>

I really appreciate you giving me
a few minutes of your time.
Yeah.

I got a little shipping problem
I need some help with.

<i>Shipping problem?
What is it? Customs?
I don't know.</i>

Well, who's your shipper?
Greater Orient.

Yeah. So what can I do for you?

Well, if you could make a phone call
for me, talk to somebody.

Yeah. Um, I could probably
do that for you. Let me find you
another shipper though.

You hungry?
You want something to eat?
No. Uh, this is my son Ben.

I'm bringing him into the business.
Hmm.

Show him what the real world
is like after grad school.

Real world.
Real world.

Good. I'll see
what I can do for you.

If you can do anything... anything at all.
Good to see you, Alex.

Yeah.

All right. Take care.

In my village, the poppy is how we live.

What other crop will you grow
to feed your family?

The government offers you
$250 an acre...

to grow something else.

<i>But the poppy can bring you $2,000.</i>

You see?

<i>Why don't you cut the bull?</i>

You're not a farmer.
You're a player.

You and your buddy,
wholesaling truckloads of the stuff.

I know about you.

<i>[Man]
Well, we're wasting our time here.</i>

So, uh,

Fazal, why don't you let us know
when you want to...

pull your turban
out of your ass?

<i>[Ben]
Who was that punk?</i>

<i>He's a guy who can help.
It's called ''guanxi. ''</i>

Right now I need a favor from him.

<i>One day,
he'll need a favor from me.</i>

He's a middleman.
I go to him, he makes a phone call.

Somebody else makes a phone call,
and our container gets expedited.

It's how things get done.
What are you getting into here, dad?
Tongs, triads?

Keep your voice down.

In this business you sometimes
have to cut corners...

<i>and hold your nose
while you're doing it.</i>


Look.

That's what I owe ya, okay?
All right.

Bonus. Here.

I... I think we should
tell the cops about...

About what?
About the guy.

<i>What guy?</i>

<i>The dead body
we pulled out of the ocean.
Listen, Dale.</i>

A fishing boat can be
a pretty dangerous place.
You know what I mean?

You want to learn the ropes,
this would be a really good time
for you to start.

Here.
No.

No. Here, here.
Go get laid.

And if anybody asks ya
how the fishing was,
you know what to say, don't ya?

Yeah. Good.

Take a break.

Enjoy yourself.

<i>It's Fashion Week.</i>

<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

<i>[Woman]
Wow.</i>

<i>Taxi!
[Horn Honking]</i>

Hey. Highlands?
Yeah, sure. Get in.

Hey, hey. Hold on.
This is my taxi.

You don't mind, do you?
Come on.

<i>You okay, bud?
Yeah.

Take me here. Thanks.

So, what are you then? A designer?
Somebody's boyfriend?

<i>[Horns Honking]</i>

No, I'm, uh, in manufacturing.
Oh, yeah?

<i>[Horns Honking]
Leisure? Sports?</i>

Well, uh, a little bit of everything.

I like the sound of that.

Can you just let him go?
I'm in a really big hurry.

<i>[ Chattering]</i>

<i>You think we should
write this Fazal off?</i>

Do we have a choice?
Ah, probably not.

So, how you doing, man?
You doing all right?

Yeah. I'm doing fine, man.

How's it going at home?
How's Tyler?

Tyler is... He's a teenager.

I mean, ''an enigma
wrapped in a mystery.''

Oh, yeah. Did Churchill say that,
or was that Madonna?
I get those two mixed up, you know.

You want a ride?

No, I got these 5-60s...
personnel crap, field reports...
I gotta take care of.

All right then, man.

I'll have to drink yours.

Let you throw a goat on the fire,
have yourself a happy Thanksgiving.

You be safe.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

You cheer up, all right?
[Engine Starts]

<i>Look out.</i>

<i>American comin'.</i>

<i>[Horn Honks]</i>


<i>[Taxi Driver]
Okay. Big party, huh?</i>

It's a fashion show actually.
Oh.

Thank you.
Cheers.

<i>Very good.</i>

Wait, wait.
You leave behind.
All right, then.

Twelve dollars, bud.
All right.

Uh, here.
Come on, darling.
I'm late. Really late.

<i>You got something smaller?
It's all I have.</i>

I'm sorry. It's too big.
Are you serious?

<i>I'm sorry.
I've just go to go.
I'm sorry.</i>

<i>[Man On Radio]
Highlands anyone?</i>

Adam. Zero, six, zero,
four, four. I got it.

Go in front of me.

Chloe! Chloe! You're late.

Louise!
Chloe.

Come on. Let's go.

<i>Excuse me, sir.
What is your relationship with her?</i>

Uh... Nothing.
Sit yourself down
for two seconds.

I tell you it's too... It's very small.
Let me take broom.

I got. That way. That way.
It's small, but three months...
short time... it's gonna be okay.

<i>[Adam's Voice] I married your sister,
straightaway I promised a house
in America. A home.</i>

<i>Can you imagine
when she gets off that boat
with our daughter here? Ah.</i>

<i>At least we have this place.</i>

I think it's a historic building.

<i>Ta-da.</i>

<i>[Woman's Voice]
She will love it. You see.
I come this weekend.</i>

<i>I cook big dinner,
and we sit all together. Yeah?
[ Chuckles]</i>

Electricity.

I take care of that.
Additional bulb here.

<i>[Laughter, Chattering]</i>

Yeah.

Yes. Whoo!


Okay.
What? Now?

What? You've got something
better to do, have you?

What's your problem?

Hmm? Sit down.


Adam, is going to be okay.
She is going to love it.

It's a start.
Yes.

Yeah.

<i>[Seagull Squawking]</i>


<i>[Man]
You got it?</i>

Hey, look. Floater.

<i>[Man]
Where?</i>

Under the pier.

Looks good.

[Over Radio]
It's a freighter.

I see a gash
on the port side.

It's opened the forward bulkheads.

Any sign of leaking oil?

Not so far.

I'll take a closer look.

I'm checking what looks like
the main hold. I'm going in.

There's something here.

God.

Oh, my God.

Hey.

<i>I need, uh,
two Social Security card,
uh, birth certificates.</i>

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Put your money away.
You said you could do this.
It's a problem?

<i>You didn't hear?
You don't know?</i>

No.

The ship went down, my friend.
What ship?

The ship. I found out
this morning. I'm sorry.

Wait, wait.
Uh, where did you find this?

Who telling you...
Who's telling you this?
Please, don't get me in trouble.

<i>[ Cell Phone Beeps On]</i>

It's me. There is a shipping problem
with the last order.

Something went wrong.

We may not be able to fulfill it.

<i>[Woman]
What does he say
about securing our borders?</i>

Sir. Numbers?
Numbers of bodies saved?

Sir, can you confirm this was
an illegal smuggling operation?

<i>[Woman #2]
Have any dead bodies washed up
in the past two hours?</i>

<i>[Man]
Are you going to make any arrests soon?
[Man #2] How about a statement?</i>

<i>- [Phone Rings]
[Man] Check the engine.
What is wrong with you?</i>

Hey, Adam, I've been
calling you for 20 minutes.

<i>Radio broke or something?</i>

<i>- Yeah. Okay, I'll pick you up.
Adam? You can't go in there.</i>

<i>He's busy. He's on the phone.
You can't...
It's okay. I'll call you back.</i>

<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

They've been calling you
for 20 minutes.

I heard the ship has gone down...
off the coast.

So?

Were they on that ship?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

My wife and daughter
are coming in this week, yes?

They're coming.

Just tell me.

Look. I run a cab company.

''Airport? Twenty minutes?
Yes, sir. Right away.''

Sometimes I put people
in touch with other people.

It's a sideline, okay?
I like to help people.

But I'm just the middleman.
That's all.

Get out of my office. Please.

Are they dead?
My wife and daughter?

This is not my concern.

Please, please.

Look. I did you a favor.
Now you do me a favor.

Leave me alone.

Were they aboard that ship?

What happened?
The ship can't go down like this.

What... What happened?
I'll look into it.

<i>[Phone Rings]
[ Chattering]</i>

<i>[Mike]
Hey.</i>

Why don't you guys, uh,
take a break, huh?

Aaah!

A couple weeks back
a friend of mine was out in the boonies.

<i>Special Forces,
doing a sweep for weapons,
ammunition dumps.</i>

<i>They ran into some Al-Qaeda.</i>

<i>[Machine Gun Fires]</i>

Now he found where the Taliban had stored
the opium that they'd confiscated
when they were in power.

<i>There's a cave filled with it.</i>

It's piled...

It's piled to the roof.

It's still there.

<i>He destroyed access to the cave.</i>

What do you think
a cave full of opium is worth?

To Uncle Sam?
No.

To the two people who, uh...

who know about it.

You and me.

And the man who found it?

Your friend?
Don't worry about him.

He got killed.

After he told me about it,
somebody booby-trapped
his rucksacks.

As an American, you really gotta
watch your back around here.

<i>It's just you and me.</i>

Don't you guys have this saying...

''Me against my brother,
my brother and me
against my cousins,

and my cousins and me
against the world,'' hmm?

We're gonna need to
get the stuff off the mountain.

We're gonna need
trucks and planes
to get it out of the country.

We need people
we can trust to guard it...

and informants to let us know
if somebody's trying to take it off us...

and to bribe people...
to look the other way.

<i>And you would trust me?
No.</i>

Not a chance, man.

I'll be there with you.

'Cause I'm the only one
who knows where the stuff is.

Okay, here it is.

Ta-da.

<i>Okay, do you want to carve it?</i>

All right. Good.

<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

Hello.
Hello?

Dad.
Tyler?

Hey. What are you up to?
Oh, you know.

I'm good. How's Mom?
She's good.

Yeah? How's the bird?

It's dead.
[Chuckles]
''It's dead.''

Of course it's dead.

Do you want to talk to Mom?
Sure, sure, sure.
Put her on.

Hey.
Hi, babe.

Happy Thanksgiving.
Is it?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

So, you know, we've had better.

You want me to speak to him?
I'll set him straight.
No, no, no. He's okay.

Just hold off on that for now.

I'm gonna be out of touch
for a couple days.
Just maybe a week.

But, uh, I'll call as soon as
I get to a phone I can use, okay?

Listen, be careful, okay?
Always, babe.

Hey, I love you.

Everything I'm doing here
is for you and Tyler.
Remember that.

Okay? Even when
it gets tough. Okay?

Mike.

Mike.
[Disconnect Signal]

Mom?

We got cut off.

Huh.

You know what I'd really love?

<i>[Man On TV]
Twice the size it was
when we found it.</i>

<i>- As long as we stay in here, we'll be safe.
[Woman]
No.! I've gotta get out ofhere.!</i>

<i>- [Man] Wait.! No.!
[Woman Screams]</i>


It's been declined, sir.

I just had to buy some...
some plane tickets on it.

Probably just a security thing
or something.

<i>Here. Uh...</i>

Sorry. Try that.

Oh, and here.
Just in case.

Yeah.

<i>[Ben]
I'm gonna shoot myself.
Declined.</i>

Don't worry about it.
God. It's all right.

<i>[Man Shouts]</i>

<i>[ Cell Phone Dialing]</i>


Yeah.
That container from Shanghai...

that you've been
busting our balls about.

Got it.
You know what to do.

Sure.

<i>[ Chattering]</i>

<i>[Woman On P.A., Indistinct]</i>

<i>[Baby Crying]</i>

So, uh, can I see you again?

<i>I've got a flat in London,
an apartment in New York,</i>

a place in south of France
and a boyfriend with...

<i>I ju... I don't fly coach,
if you see what I'm getting at.</i>

I'm sorry, love.

Get rid of this for me.

<i>[ Chattering]</i>

Watch your step.

Prisoner transfer.
Yes, sir?

Intelligence wants a word with this guy.
Let him through.

All right. Looking good.

<i>[Mike]
Okay. This is great.
Just what I need.</i>


<i>Keep your mouth shut, Fazal.
Understand?</i>


Come on. Come on.
Move out of the friggin' way, man.

Just be nice to me.

<i>Hold it.</i>

You're good. Go ahead.
Thanks.

<i>[Man Speaking Foreign Language]</i>

<i>[ Doorbell Buzzes]</i>

Yes?

Zula.
I'll be right there.

<i>[ Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

<i>- Hello.
[Man]
Alex,</i>

<i>your container from
Greater Orient's been hijacked.</i>

<i>It's been what?</i>

<i>The whole shipment's
been cleaned out.</i>

Everything?

<i>Sorry, Alex.
Everything.</i>

I'll get back to you.


What?
Have you heard anything...

about your sister?

No.

The ship they were supposed to
be coming in on, it, uh...

I heard it's...
What?

I heard that it's gone down.

No. No, no.

<i>[ Cell Phone Rings]</i>

<i>[Elevator Bell Dings]</i>

<i>Excuse me.
[Ringing Continues]</i>

Excuse me.

Hello.
It's me.

The shipment for
the Shirt Palace was hijacked.

What? Where?
They took
every single piece inside it.

None of it was insured.
Dad,

what... what kind of business
are you running?

I've been running this place
single-handed since your mom died.

Do you think it's easy
to make a living in this business?

Dad...
You know how many companies
go to the wall every year?

You didn't exactly turn out to be
the... the Bill Gates
of the real estate world, did ya?

Huh? Dad.

<i>Dad? Dad?</i>

Hey, uh...
Where is this place?

If I told you that,
you wouldn't need me,
now, would ya?

Cousin.

You have to earn the right
to call someone ''cousin.''

<i>[Adam]
I don't know if it is that ship.</i>

<i>I keep telling myself it can't be.</i>

But if it is... if it's true...

nobody made it off ship.

<i>Nobody.
Not one person survive.</i>

You...

You put my sister on that ship.

I don't even know what happened.
You put her on it
with her little girl.

I... I came in the same way.
The same people.

So did you.
You know how dangerous it is.

You know.

Yes.

Hey, I am sorry.

[Exhales deeply]

I just want... them here.

That's all.
I just want us together again.

<i>[ Door Opens]
Zula.</i>

Sarah has a make-up ballet class
after her art lesson.

<i>- Can you pick her up
before Polly's piano lesson?
Yes.</i>

<i>Are you here about
the water filter?</i>

Uh, no, no.
He is my brother-in-law.

Oh, sorry. Hi.

<i>I'll leave you two alone.
Nice to have met you.</i>

Hey.
Hey.

[Woman]
Okay. Bye-bye, Ronny.
How is he?

<i>[Machine Beeping]
We'll know in a few hours.</i>

I hear he, uh, lost the container.

Something travels
halfway around the world,

gets to Seattle and... Phoom...
just like that.

There's a lot of bad people
out there.

Yeah. But this shipment
was pretty special.

Your dad really needed this one.

I mean, he really needed this one.

<i>Your dad had
a cash flow problem.</i>

I put him in touch with somebody,
the loan was secured on that shipment...

for 250,000.

Uh,

do you have documentation?

Yeah, well, your father
and the lender wanted to
keep it off the books.

I mean, did somebody say ''I.R.S.''?

I need to speak to the lender.
Ehh! Wrong.
That isn't how it works.

<i>My dad told me about guanxi...
I do a favor for you,
you do one for me.</i>

<i>- And I can't run a business that way.
Guanxi?</i>

What is that?
Some kind of old Chinese shtick?
Talk American to me, okay?

Look. I need paperwork, documents,
some kind of verification of funds.
Ehh!

Wrong again.
You have to start listening.
This is how it's done.

No, this is how it's done.
I'm taking over
until my dad gets better.

I didn't ask for it, but I'm doing it.

Yeah, like you did
that property development, right?

Yeah, developing lofts downtown.

What was it the banks foreclosed
on you for that? Five million?

Guess you're not looking for
Young Businessman of the Year, huh?

Hey.
No.

No, no, no.
It's not that.
It's not that.

He's okay?
He's fine.

What are you doing here?
I'm working here.
How you doin'?

Oh, my God.
God, you're a sight for sore eyes.

Come in, come in, come in.
He's okay?
Yeah, yeah. No, he's fine.

When did you get here?
I just got here.

<i>Uh, 14 hours in the hold of a C-14
and no in-flight movie and, you know...</i>

Oh, my God.
It's so good to see you. God.

This is a nice place.
Yeah, yeah.

We have so much to do. Come in.
Let me get you something to drink.

Lieutenant, we found
Mike's vehicle.

<i>[Man]
Yeah, it's Mike McKay's jeep.</i>

It doesn't look good.

It's been riddled with small arms fire.

<i>AK- 47. No bodies.</i>

Everything suggests
he's been taken through a minefield.

Really.
He misses you and Tyler.

I'm so sorry about before.
I really am.

It's just that Mike always said
that if anything ever happened to him,

you know, it would be you
who came to tell us.

It's not like that.
He just wanted me to
check in on you guys,

see how the move was going.
Yeah, well,

<i>the move could be going
a little more quickly.</i>

This is gonna be an office... someday.
Well, it's getting there.

Look. Do you need help
with, uh, these boxes?

Uh, yeah.

Where's this go?
These are all up.

So when'd you speak to him last?

<i>Uh, Thanksgiving.
[ Chuckles]</i>

<i>Where am I going?
Straight ahead.</i>

Where are they going?
Oh, God knows.

Could be across the border
in Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,

or any other couple of
million square miles
of pissant nothing.

How do we know he's still alive?
Maybe you should be
hoping he's not.

<i>Remember that C.I.A. Station chief
the Lebanese tortured on camera?</i>

How did he sound?
Uh, I don't know.

A little odd, actually.

He said something like,
uh, even if it gets tough,

for me not to worry...
that it's all about Tyler and me.

''Even if it gets tough,'' huh?
Yeah.

Wonder what he meant by that.
I don't know.
I got cut off.

I didn't get a chance to ask him.

It's odd really. You know,
he usually keeps everything inside.

This guy.

Yeah.

And that guy right there.

Oh.

<i>This guy here.
Yes.</i>

The guy there... definitely.
[Foreign Language]

<i>[Horse Whinnies]</i>

<i>This guy.</i>

Yes.

[Foreign Language]
Ah.

Definitely him.

This guy right here.
Oh. Sure.

Good.

<i>[Tyler]
Hold on. Hold on.</i>

Oh, hey, big man.
How you doin'?

You gonna help your mom
with these boxes?

<i>- I don't know.
Are you my dad?
No, I'm not.</i>

I'm your dad's best buddy.
If he's not here to whip your ass,
he said I should do it.

Put your weight on the back foot.
Back foot.

Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on, you...

If you don't pull your weight
around here with Mama,
you better answer to me, chief.

Dig it?

You ready?
We leave right now?

Travel fast and light,
under everybody's radar screen.

We get in, we get out.

Granny is still sitting on the porch.
Sippin' her lemonade.

[Speaks Foreign Language]

<i>Wait, please.
Let me see your map.</i>

Map, map, map. Oh.

<i>It's all up here.
[Horse Whinnying]</i>

<i>[Mike]
Yeeeee-ha.!</i>

<i>- All right?
Yeah, I won't make you work.</i>

I promise.
You can just come over and eat.
If Mike gets in touch again, let me know.

I will.
He owes me a couple of beers.

<i>Later.
See ya.
Be good to your mother.</i>

Maybe.

Bye. Thank you so much.
All right.

<i>See ya.
Bye.</i>

<i>Did he say exactly
when Dad was coming back?</i>

No. Just that he'd be a little longer
than he thought he'd be.

Like Christmas?
I hope so.

Maybe Christmas next year?
Oh, maybe.
When'd you get to be so funny?

You're really...
You're really comin' along
with the comedy.

[Engine Starts]

I gotta know
what we're into these guys for.

I mean, you know,
what are we looking at?

[Breathing Erratically]

[No Audible dialogue]

I love you, dad.

<i>[ Doorbell Rings]</i>

Afternoon. Alarm company.

Thanks.

Any idea where the control panel is?

Oh, no.
I have no idea.

It's usually in the laundry room.
Why don't we start there?
Laundry room's there.

There? Okay, thanks.
I'm gonna check the window.

<i>Sure.</i>

<i>[ Car Alarm Chirps]</i>

She's at her car.

<i>[Man]
Give me your hand.</i>

As long as they're touching,
you've got a circuit.

I need to check something upstairs.
All right.

<i>- You pull them apart,
break the connection and...
[Alarm Beeping]</i>

All right?

We're movin'.
E.T.A.?

<i>Eight to 1 0 minutes.</i>

Frank, we ought to wrap it up.

<i>[Frank]
You're hardwired for smoke and fire.</i>

I've gotta check the fire station
to get an automatic signal.

You mind getting that? Thanks.

Thanks, buddy.

<i>[Man]
She's heading for home.
How you guys doin'?</i>

We're through in here, aren't we, Frank?
We're all done.

<i>[Phone Rings]
[ Chattering]</i>

<i>[Man]
I don't want to have to
lie to her again.</i>

<i>I don't want to have to face her son
knowing we don't have any idea
where his father is.</i>

Until we get some answers,
there's no point in telling her any more.

How about the fact
that she's married to him?
He phoned her.

He didn't tell her what he was doing,
where he was going,
when he would contact her?

That's right.
Are you sure of that?

Is there something
you want to tell me?
Something I'm missing here?

Your buddy disappeared
in the company of a drug dealer.

Just let me have this one.
Just one. This guy.

<i>[Woman]
A drug dealer he took a lot of risk
to get a hold of.</i>

You want him, you go through me.

You want his wife and his son to know that?
Until we clear up just what happened.

He was ambushed.
They shot up his jeep and grabbed him.

That's what it looks like.
That's how it was.

That's right.

What else could it be?


<i>[Sighs]</i>

Oh, geez.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

<i>[Ben]
I'm trying to restructure the debt.
I- I just need a couple weeks.</i>

<i>Okay, fine.
Sue our asses off.</i>

We'll go Chapter 11.
You'll be lucky to get
three cents on the dollar.

<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

Hello. He's not in.
I'm running the company until...

<i>[Man]
Ben.! Ben.! Look.! Your car.!</i>

Look! It's on fire!

<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>

<i>[ Cell Phone Rings]</i>

Next time it'll be your house.

<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>

[Tires Screech]

<i>[Man]
You see anything?</i>

Hear anything?
Somebody running away maybe?

Uh, no. No.

You have any trouble with your neighbors?
Business dispute with anybody?

No, no. Noth...
Nothing like that.

You're fully insured?

Yeah, well,
I-I gotta look into that.

<i>[ Cell Phone Rings]
Excuse me.
I gotta take this.</i>

Yeah?

Yes.

<i>[Knocking On Door]
What?</i>

Did anybody call?
No. Two guys came by
to wire the alarm system.

They said they couldn't come
till next week.

<i>- [Phone Rings]
That's odd.</i>

Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.

Yeah, no, the move went fine.

Oh, we've had a lot of practice.

<i>[Men Chattering In Foreign Language]</i>

[Foreign Language]

<i>[Fazal]
Gholab? Gholab.</i>


<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

Wearing your seat belt?
No.

Come on. Put it on.
How many times I have to tell you?
Okay. Okay.

<i>[Men Speaking Foreign Language]</i>

[Foreign Language]

This is Gholab.
Hi.

This is an American.
Oh. Hello.

Want to buy.
Hi, mister.

How are you?
[Foreign Language]

Yes?

Tell him I'm looking for modern Soviet.
[Foreign Language]

This is World War II Enfield.
It's from the Second World War.
Tell him to get serious.

[Foreign Language]

Modern.
The M16 gave us more headaches
in Vietnam than the Vietcong did.

A bren gun, a tommy gun.

You tell this guy to be serious.
Yeah. He's got stuff. He's got good stuff.

No, no. Follow.

I'm coming.

Ah, yes. You see?
[Foreign Language]

Now you're talking.
[Foreign Language]

Yeah, this is what I'm interested in.

This is what it's...
This is good.
[Foreign Language]

<i>[Man Yelling In Foreign Language]</i>


<i>[Man]
Hey, good to see ya.
The team's gonna win today?</i>

<i>[Woman]
Go, Ben.</i>

<i>[Woman #2]
All the way.! All the way.!
Come on. Oh.</i>

<i>[ Crowd Yelling, Chattering]</i>

All I want to know is
were they aboard that ship?

I can't tell you
because I don't know.

Nobody knows.

But there are people you could ask...
people who do know.

Look. You've got people
moving all over the world.

Millions of them.

Chinese, Haitians,
Albanians, Kurds... whatever.

Most of them want to come here.

<i>That's what you paid me for...
to bring your family here.</i>

All I know is the ship went down.

If you're serious about
becoming legal... American...

I suggest you drop this.

He's good, huh?
Your son.

Russian guy... soldier...
he... he was found on street of village
where I used to live in Chechnya.

He... He fall off truck, drunk.

Break his neck... accident.

But they assumed it was
Chechen guerrillas.

Uh, they demand that the head man
pay for this crime.

He said, ''No.''

They didn't come after him.

Not directly. They, uh...

They kill his daughter,

his son,

his mother...

and his wife, one by one.

He paid.

American way is to...
What? Call the police, yes?

But remember, I'm illegal.

I have to do other way.

Look, look, look.
I... I was schoolteacher, okay?

The... The Russians invaded again.

I had to spend five years
in refugee camp in Ingushetia.

They want get rid of us,
Russians kill us if we go back.

<i>[Adam]
Ah.! Aha.!
[ Clapping]</i>

America... that is it.
That is all I dreamed of.

To have my family
here with me together again.

<i>That is what I working for.
That is what I paid you for.
Here.</i>

Contact these people.
Maybe they can tell you something.

Here. Take it.
I'm just the guy who puts people
in touch with other people.

Take an advance, okay?

Keep the cab for a couple of days.
I don't care.

Just leave me alone.

<i>[Whistle Blows]</i>

<i>[ Chattering]</i>

<i>[Gholab Speaking Foreign Language]</i>

He says he brought down
a Russian helicopter
with one of these.

<i>Yes.! Fall down.!
Fall down.!
My ass, he did.</i>

You ask him, uh,
if he's got any, uh, mines.
Claymore mines.

Uh, claymore.
Claymore. Mines.
Mines.

Yes. Yes. Come, come, brother.

Mines.

Switch. Yes.

And a remote.

For what do we need claymore?
You just never know.

[Foreign Language]

Tap. Keeyo!

Done!

Adam.

Uh, I come with you.

Let me do this... alone.
No, she is my sister.

I will come back.
I tell you what happened.
No, Adam. It's not just that.

I have to see it.
I have to see where.

Under... Understand me.

There has to be some way
to say good-bye.

Maybe they're not dead.

How do we know?

Huh? There is still a chance. No?

Maybe not everybody died.

You stay here and wait for me.

<i>Listen, if it were up to me,
I'd give you a couple days to grieve.</i>

But you're just
the middleman, right?

Your company has a regular,
legitimate trade with China, Taiwan,

Indonesia and the Philippines.

Now, from time to time,
your father would give us
a container number,

what port it's coming from,
name of the ship.

I mean, take a look.

<i>Two, three million of these
come through here every year.</i>

Now what's the odds against
any one of them being searched?

Whatever they are,
I don't have the option
of closing down the company.

Is that what you're telling me?
We'd like to keep the relationship
going with you. Yes.

Relationship?

First you stick me up
for a quarter mil.
Then you burn my car.

Now you won't even let me
bury my dad without trying to
nail my ass to something else?

<i>You need to work on
your relationships, pal.</i>

And you need to remember
that this is the real world,

and in the real world
you're just a loser who can't pay
the bills now that daddy's gone.

You do as you're told.

And one funeral in the family
is enough, isn't it?

We have a container
coming in today.

We need somewhere to unload it...
somewhere quiet,
used to handling overseas freight,

near the freeway.

You tell security
you're expecting a delivery,
make sure nobody's workin' late.

That's all you have to do.
And maybe go to prison for 10 years.

<i>[Man]
There's a guy coming up to see you.</i>

Uh, uh, Adam.
I don't know his last name.

Uh, Chechen.

<i>Let me put it this way.</i>

<i>I don't need him coming back here
asking, uh, too many questions
anytime soon, okay?</i>

<i>[Ship Horn Blows]
[Seagull Squawking]</i>

<i>Do you know
the name of the boat?
He said, ''Star Pacific. ''</i>

There.

<i>[Men Chattering]</i>

Why don't you wait here?
Uh, let me speak to them.

<i>No. I'm going too.</i>

<i>No, we don't want to cause anybody trouble.
We don't want blame anyone.</i>

This is my sister-in-law.

She... She lost her sister.

I lose my... my wife, my daughter.

Little... Little girl.

Yeah, well, we're just the guys
that meet the ships, you know?

We never know
what's coming in half the time.
We get the phone call, we go out.

<i>Some nights it's packages.</i>

<i>- Other nights it's illegals.
[Adam]
People.</i>

<i>- Huh?
Let's go.</i>

<i>People. It is people.
Human beings.</i>

Yeah. All right.
People. Whatever.
My wife and daughter is...

<i>[Wayne]
Take 'em someplace quiet.</i>

<i>There's transport waitin'for 'em.</i>

<i>After that, it's none of our business.</i>

How can ship go down
just like that?

<i>That's a dangerous piece
of water out there, boy.
It can take a ship any size.</i>

With no warning? Nothing?
Sorry to hear about your family.

<i>It could have hit a reef, sprung a plate.
Anything could have happened.</i>

Yeah, everybody did what they could.
Okay? You gotta believe that.
I mean, this is how we make a living.

No.
You think we wanna
lose a ship that size?

<i>- Come on.
[Wayne]
That's our payday, buddy.</i>

Adam, we go.
Adam, we go.

Go. Go.

Jesus.
What did I tell you, huh?

<i>- [Wayne]
Shut up.!
Come on, Adam.</i>

We go to the morgue
to identify bodies.
