TRASH COMPACTOR

GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE

I can feel it, man.

It's like this giant...

...cosmic force,
an energy field...

...created by all living things.

It surround us, it penetrates us...
Benji, I'm trying to write.

If I don't finish this script in 3 days,
I don't graduate.

You're lost man...

You know, my mom is coming this weekend,
so could you clean up the "farmacy"?

So Lucas, we meet again.

Aaron, you live next door.

My script is now complete.

Soon I will rule the industry
and you will still be writing line one of...

...whatever it's called.

"3XR-259.7"

Exactly.

And George, the beard...

...not working for you.

O shit, I'm gotta meet my profesor!

Chuck, are you OK?

Hey, check around, kid.

She is the fastest
thing on campus.

Yeah, maybe later, Hal.

They are coming for us all!

Beware...

...of the Dark Side, the...
evil empire!

Yes, I thought it was
quite rude as well.

So, yeah, ah...

...it's not what you would call 
technically, done, yet...

...but it's about a
young space farmer...

..who is... he's struggling with a...

...with a terrible crop...

...of space wheat.

Hm, struggle!

Yeah, and, he's also, he's searching...
No!

Search not.

Inspiracion will you not find.

It will find you.

Could you talk forward?

Too much already have I said.

OK, thank you...

You've been a big... help.

Space wheat, space corn...

Space oats?

You're beautiful!

I'm sorry, I don't normaly
talk to girls like that...

..I don't normally talk to girls.
So, yeah, I'm sorry.

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
know anybody was in here.

I usually just like to come here to think.

You do?

I mean... I'll leave.

Wait.

You are George Lucas, right?

I'm Marion.
I loved your student films.

"1.42.08", "6.18.67"...

...great titles.

I can't believe you saw them.

Yeah. They had such pasion,
such vision.

I loved them.

Do you wanna to sit down?

I'm just beginning to think that
space oats isn't the answer.

Maybe you just weren't meant to write
agricultural space tragedies.

You've got to write from you heart,
just let people onto your dreams.

You think so?

I do.

I really do.

Oh, damn, you know, I've gotta go.
There is a big protest...

...I'm kind of leading a student rebellion.

Will I see you again?

Definitely.

Don't worry so much.

Just write what you know.

Just like "bull's eye Womp rats"...

Ah, my hand!

It's amazing.

You are amazing.

You are my inspiration.

I feel... like we are so connected...

Me too.

Mom?

Mom?!?

Hi, kids.

Hey, George!

Check out my new duck.

I named him Howard.
