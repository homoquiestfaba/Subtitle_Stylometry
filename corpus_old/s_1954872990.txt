Yup

Well, I go to the bathroom.

One moment, we want to talk to you.

I did nothing, they make a mistake.

Looks like we were right. But committed no crime.

We take you to the clinic Ferriday.

-Â¡No! -Aura Petruscu, vamos.

Do not take me there, I have a lot of money ...

... I can give you thousands of dollars.

Do not worry, we'll take you there.

The law says we should take with your parents.

-Help. -DÃ©jenla Go.

Relax, everything is under control. Walk.

Home Sweet Home.

Leave me alone! Let me go! Damn It!

What do you want?

Good evenning. We are Metro Youth Services.

-Yes Y? We brought her daughter.

Ah, my beautiful daughter.

My beautiful girl.

I am the mother of this difficult but beautiful girl.

Thank you for bringing me back my baby.

They have been very kind. Thank You.

It was for your sake that you got in that clinic.

There you will stay until we decide what to do.

Let me go. I hate being there.

Please do not make me go back. I will die.

Stephan! Look who's back.

Two policemen brought as a criminal.

What a surprise. It always causes problems for your mother.

Sorry, Daddy. But the clinic is horrible.

I want to kill.

Take her up and give her some tea ...

... I wait inside.

Come On.

This is too much. Your mother is very angry.

I know, Daddy. But let me stay here.

-stop It. I swear I'll be better.

Your mother has a lot to think about today.

-Another Session spiritualist? -A Large.

Then I'll take dinner.

Try to eat. Make your mother is happy.

-I Am not hungry. -Aura, You should eat.

So you will return to the clinic.

Good night, Stephan.

I'm glad to see you. Give me your umbrella.

It's a horrible night. But just like the spirits.

She is very good. When Nicholas start talking.

Look at my hands.

I'm the one who called.

Oh my goodness.

Am I late?

Will Get?

Ask Question.

Can we communicate with my mother?

We have so many questions, we're here.

Nicholas, my dear. You help us?

Nicholas, are you here tonight?

I'm looking for.

Let me in.

Let me in.

This is not Nicholas. There is another spirit here.

He is trying to enter.

A soul that follows the newly dead ...

... Who follow their murderers.

Speaks ...

My head.

They took me head!

A monster with a bow.

I was not the first, nor will I be the last.

I know who the murderer.

Am I the only one who knows!

The murderer is ...

Â¡Presente!

Do not break the chain.

I see you!

You can not hide from me! I know you.

Â¡Mami! Â¡Mami!

You must have seen something. Who was?

I did not see anything.

If anything I saw.

Had the heads in front of his face.

Look at those strange things. Should be things of the occult.

It's getting late. Bring me home.

There was something wrong from the start. I sensed.

Did not hear anything?

Do you have another relative other than their parents?

No, Captain. Until his recent escape was under ...

-... My care. -for Real?

It was my patient in Ferriday clinic.

Her parents wanted there.

What was it?

No what I can say, Captain.

But it has nothing to do with it.

We take her back. Needs our help.

Go to the center tomorrow and fill the forms ...

... With youth services. Sure that the delivered ...

... After the interrogate.

Another strange double murder and you go insane 4.

The striking steel workers renegotiated.

Price increases damaged their pockets.

It seems you could have fun with that.

They call it the "Hunt-Heads".

That I heard.

I suppose you what Grace said.

Yes, we talked occasionally.

Then you will be told how he is.

Do not worry Mark, nobody saw.

What comic, you're very funny.

Now can we work?

Do you you do Arnie, plus fat?

We have a main compound using the KKK last night ...

... Landing ship ...

... And the president's trip to Belgrade.

Is there sex?

It is probable, the first lady will not go.

Forget it. I think there was sex in the Tour de France. OK?

God will not appear in front of it.

Welcome Grace.

Can not we do something more stylish?

I did this. But not yet finished.

That's better. -is Not it.

I'd rather have just written something.

Maybe "Hunt-Heads"

-what A great idea. -OriginalÃ­simo.

I have to go back. Ben wants you to review the ads.

Grace, which is that suit you well.

'I know we can give. I what?

Great lyrics written as blood.

3 meters high.

Hi Yes. Speaks him.

Of course I love her. Where the hell are you?

I only got $ 6 to eat.

I was wandering all night.

How you find me?

For your document. First I called your house.

'Are not you go? -Do Not.

Looking for a place to stay?

No, I need something more. Would you want to help me?

You Need some more money? -Do Not.

So what?

I want to go home.

Want to go home? I'll take you.

Come to my office and call your parents.

Everything's gonna be all right.

Will not you raise and call your parents?

Okay, I will go find my keys. Wait for me?

There were two other victims beheaded last night ...

... In a house opposite the park Inhamus the north.

The victims were two professional spiritualists.

Stephan y Adrianne Petrescu.

Captain Travis, Do victims are random or is there a pattern?

We know that all were paralyzed by a stroke ...

... And were aware during the murder.

Do you see that never shows any of those idiots?

I'm going out for a while.

Immigrants from Romania, 10 years ...

... And had an only daughter, Aura, 16.

Tell Grace I had to leave.

I have a very good track for a note.

The child is reported missing since last night.

Aura, why you wanna go home?

I need some clothes.

How did you know my name?

I saw it on the news ...

... I'm sorry ...

... I can not imagine how you feel.

Do not have relatives who can stay?

It's not your business.

I just wanted to help. I do not need your help.

I do not think we should go home.

I think you should see a doctor.

Doctor! I will not see more doctors!

I just sneak one, I do not need another.

I need answers. I want to know who killed my parents.

Stop here. No stations nearby.

No light, must be in the storm last night.

Are you sure you wanna do this?

Yup.

Okay. Where is the basement?

This way.

I think it's there.

So Perfect.

Be right back.

Mom. Â¡Mami!

... I will not be the last.

I know who the murderer.

Am I the only one who knows!

The murderer is ...

Â¡Presente!

I almost did not recognize her. -to Who?

My mom. It is the first time I hear this.

All right.

Come On! Come On!

What happened?

Someone broke my window.

It should be a warning. Damn It!

The police!

Stay down.

Hi, I was told that you have a great note for me.

Do you want to put on my land?

Call me at the station if you return before 10.

Then I'm in the air again. Goodbye Bye.

Gabriel, what do you do? Go to sleep.

Mami, the woman of the house looks at me all the time.

-It Does not move. -go To bed.

There is no woman there.

Yes there is. He is looking. It is a black lady.

Sorry to call so late, Mr. Ferriday. But I was not.

We had a board meeting. I'll talk to you ...

... About the girl that got away.

Aura Petruscu.

Dr. Judd, the clinic does not need the publicity.

Let me, Mr. Ferriday. I'll find her.

My head.

They took me head!

Hello

I was thinking to go home tonight.

No, not tonight, Grace.

Do not you want me?

There is another person here. He's sleeping in the other room.

Is it someone I know?

No, it's just a girl who did not know where to spend the night.

Good-bye, then. Grace.

He said I was anorexic.

I would not have imagined.

Do not beat yourself. Anorexics keep their secrets.

Behave, hide their problems.

Are you serious? What else?

Well, they are very attached to an unstable mother.

They are upper middle class girls. Boys too.

In general they are the brightest and artistic.

What else? How could I forget? Sex.

What about sex? Did you sleep with her?

Annie is just a child.

-Same, Did you? -Do Not!

I thought so. Anorexics are afraid of sex.

Want to go back to his childhood. A when there was fear.

There are about 8 million patients.

How do you know all this?

Why Talk-Shows looked like everyone else.

I do not look.

There's your problem.

This is television! You can not go well and ...

You should see it and eat it.

This is a way to let anorexia.

Seriously. Your friend may be in danger.

Many anorexics die. Commit suicide.

The worst is that she will not leave your help.

She wants your help but leave you.

How did you get that?

Problems with parents.

Are said to have a recurring dream ...

... Where his father were about to kiss.

Concaliaconmisia.

Teliapolytheus

Talk to you soon ...

Grace, Â¿me perdonas?

That girl is just a name?

Yup.

I do not see very safe.

Believe me, I do not hide anything.

Are you coming to dinner tonight?

Maybe, maybe.

Hola como andas?

David, are you? I continue to see that scene in my mind

Well, I'm back. Do you need anything?

No, I recently ate

-for Real? -Yup. And you do not know the mess I left in the kitchen.

I made roast chicken and chips.

Now I feel full, I'm tired and want to go to sleep

Aura, I'm a little worried about you.

No, do not tell me that.

See you soon. Chau.

Just cook the food. There must be some progress.

No, you're probably lying, David.

They are not easy to cure. So many die.

Many anorexics commit suicide.

There are about 8,000,000 of them.

Very attached to an unstable mother.

It will dream that his father is about to kiss her.

-what Was that? Not heard anything.

I'll see.

-what Was it? -he Left.

So? I'll go for it.

Do not be ridiculous. You can not shoquear so easily.

Let Grace. It's just a girl.

Te is exploding. As everyone else.

Believe me Grace. Need help. It wants to commit suicide.

It was in the damn clinic Ferriday whole last month.

Does the Ferriday clinic? You Joke.

The mistreated. But he escaped.

It is a manipulative crazy. Let her go.

Fuck you, Grace.

David, David. Damn It!

Sorry about last night. Do not want to leave.

Are you angry with me?

-Not, do you are you? No, I'm not angry.

Good, because I have to go to work.

I because?

Because I have to pretend to be a normal person.

Go to the market and buy fruits and vegetables that you like.

Ok T. I'll make a delicious meal.

Watching TV will get everything.

The 18, 23 and 29. Do not you realize?

... Only God kills when it rains.

Stay away from the rain.

If you wait. A time.

It is for you, your new girlfriend.

David, went to the market and saw Dr. Judd.

He followed me and I ...

No, let me go!

Will Get?

Â¿Aura? Are you there?

Will Get?

He is not here.

How do you know that is not here?

I was worried about you and her.

You yourself said he wanted to commit suicide.

So I did what any responsible person.

I called Ferriday. They will know help her.

Did you call the clinic?

I hope you're happy!

I did not think would meet again so soon.

Is it because I'm charming?

You can go. Miss. Petruscu is an old friend.

Aura is alone now and I must take care.

All up to you.

If you're willing to see inside you ...

... And face the past.

You are not interested in me. Want something more.

I want you to get better. That I want.

But the secret is there.

Do not worry.

I'll reveal one thing.

The head of each human being contains the soul ...

... The only puzzle that is the universe.

Look inside your head. Opens memory.

And the universe will open as a map.

Aura, do you see this?

It will help you remember everything.

What is it?

A very rare arrears. A psychotropic very strong.

It is a drug. I do not want drugs.

It is not a drug. Work with memory.

Clears obstacles.

Do not worry. Come on, take it.

Squeeze Mulberry teeth and drink the juice.

No, I beg you.

That's it. Now squeeze it.

The power of your brain and your imagination ...

... They are stronger than a volcano.

Carry on.

Now I remember. It was you.

Carry on.

I do not want to.

His face ... behind the heads of mommy and daddy.

The face of who? You saw her.

The face of who, Aura?

-I Did not see anything. 'Do I think.

It's the truth.

Damn It!

Take her to her room.

No, leave me alone.

Denlen painkillers.

Please let me go.

Responds you.

Please do not.

Try not to move. Should metÃ©rta vein.

Save you I can hurt your arm. Be good.

Good night.

Come On.

Stay still.

Be still treasure.

Okay. That's it.

Looking for Aura Petruscu. What room are you?

I can not give you that information.

In addition, visiting hours are over.

All right.

Where were you? I do not want to hear excuses.

It was in service ...

Keys.

God.

It's me. Are you okay?

Me drogaron.

'Where did you get? -The Stole.

Wait here. Are you going to be okay?

I'll see what happens. Stay here.

You. did it! You. did it!

Let's get outta here!

Tonight, the Ferriday clinic was the scene ...

... A series of horrific beheadings.

Aura, Aura, come here.

They killed anyone in the Ferriday clinic. I knew it!

It was ... my nurse.

Are you sure?

He worked with Dr. Judd. She was the one who shot me.

Did you hear something? Did you see anything? -Do Not.

Wherever you go, people die.

Come on, you're not responsible for their deaths.

The director of the clinic, Dr. Leopold Judd ...

... Was not available for comment.

You're not a killer. You're a thief.

On the local scene, the weather is improving.

-what Is this? -The Keys to the nurse.

It's all my fault.

"Marigold" I know that place. Is a deposit.

It's time to turn off the TV and go to bed.

I want you're sleeping for when you arrive.

Not afraid to go to sleep alone. Do Not?

No, Mommy. Good-bye, I love you.

He had his head.

I did not see anything. It's the truth.

Maybe the police were already here.

It is not possible. How will you know about this site?

They're going to find. You see something in the house Hilda ...

... A key or a receipt. Let's not waste our time.

Seven years ago this home is rented by the same person.

And sometimes they come here they can count on the fingers of one hand.

The police! Let'S Get Going! Come on now!

Wait, the key! That's grip police.

Mira. This is strange. They're all dead.

OMG ... she is dead. She and her too.

"Dear Hilda, in memory of the crazy times we had ...

... With Love, Linda "

She must be Linda.

"Linda Quirk. 992, calle Benton."

He lives near here. At least alive when they took the picture.

What is this?

Looks like a badge.

I think he is the murderer. The Doctor.

How do you know? She could be the killer.

Not likely.

Do not know what a murderer.

I'll give this to the police ... anonymously.

Tomorrow will be too late.

Alice knew. Also Katherine and Georgia ...

... Why I have so much fear.

All we were stuck in that.

-in What? -In An accident.

Before you met me?

ECT was my specialty.

Was treatment of shock?

I thought I knew all about it.

Including how to make people forget everything.

Quirk, Quirk ... there it is.

Is L. Quirk. But there is another street.

But what did you do?

Something horrible.

I do not know how we free ourselves from this.

-Hello. -Â¿Linda Quirk?

I want a room overlooking the parking lot.

Â¿When parking?

Yup.

Do you think it will rain?

It's a beautiful day. Sure not.

Because I do not want to get wet.

Hi, yes, to rise.

Lloyd.

-Â¿El Doctor Lloyd? Do you still work here?

No, it was long ago.

But he returned a few years ago and looked terrible.

He fled with medicine clinic, if I understand.

Yes I understand. Do you know where can I find it?

The last I heard of him is that he lived in the district of deposits.

You can search bars.

Good thanks.

She's Hilda Volkman. Worked here.

And Linda Quirk.

Harry, I know who are women. Who is he?

Dr. Lloyd. What curious.

A guy just now came with the same photo.

What did you say to him?

I sent it to the warehouse district.

Want something?

Are you Dr. Lloyd?

Perhaps I was in another life.

Do you have money?

No, but Linda Quirk, Hilda Volkman, ...

... Did these names sound?

Â¿Katherine Duran? Â¿Georgia Jackson?

-leave Me alone. They're dead. Did you know?

People die every day.

'They were decapitated. I what?

I said we were beheaded.

God ... that's not my fault.

Let Doctor Lloyd. You must tell me something.

It is too late.

You must know something.

Do Not! Leave me alone!

This is my phone. Call me if you change your mind.

This used to be a nice neighborhood.

That's all I had, a phone number: David.

What's this?

I'm here. I'll take you back.

Aura, come with me.

'What happens there! Enough! Help me!

I used to love her. I used to love her.

Come see this.

Stay there, you can not pass.

Come on, muÃ©vase.

Aura returns!

Â¿Aura? Go Back!

Will Have !. Will Have !.

SÃ¡lvenla.

-what Does he say? I think "Save her"

A little late for that.

SÃ¡lvenla, sÃ¡lvenla.

The terror of "Hunting-Heads" that threatened the city ...

... Ended this morning when an old Cadillac ...

... Crashed near Lake Veronica.

The driver, Dr. Leopold Judd, died on the spot ...

The severed heads of all his victims ...

... Were in the trunk of his car.

Ben Aldridge was there and spoke with the police.

Captain Travis, Will the Doctor Judd was the murderer?

The evidence we found it connects to the murders.

What was his motive?

Looks like he was obsessed with para-Normal.

Other than that I see no other reason.

Will they continue with the investigation?

As far as I am concerned, this case is now closed.

What led to the brilliant psychologist Leopold Judd ...

... Specialist anorexia and chief clinical Ferriday ...

... To commit these crimes?

What they had in common victims?

Â¿Shared secret that met ...

... In this sad fate?

These and more are the questions ...

... To be made in our special report.

But one thing is clear. The nightmare is over.

Grace Hannigton, please.

Grace, me, David.

I need some recipes.

Let's Grace.

Please only two, please.

All right.

Someone wearing a bracelet.

What thing is this?

Did you think that was Aura? Was just me.

You wanted to see Aura.

Aura ... I knew you would see.

Do not wanna see you do this.

Where are we? -In My mom's house above.

How did we get up?

-is Alive? -Yup.

God, where is it now?

Side Up. Fast. Fast.

No time.

What are you doing?

Chaining the door.

In work.

At least let's try fucking.

Â¿David?

I do not understand. I thought your mother was dead.

La seen decapitated, Â¿no?

I saw a body. But it was not her. It was a neighbor.

Oh my God.

He faked his own death.

I should have realized. He was ahead of me.

In the dark it looked like someone had two heads.

But it was only one, my father.

He was sure that Judd had killed your mother.

No, he never killed anyone.

But he knew who the killer:

My mom.

Help! Somebody help us!

Help us to leave the house!

I can not believe your mother killed those people.

Yes it did.

Are you sure killed your father? -Yup!

I because? I because?

Here he comes.

Take the chain.

Do not do it.

Do not let your mother outside.

Never hurt you. You know that.

I can not hear you.

I will never hurt you.

Open this door. Take the chain.

Take it out! Take it out now!

Why do you do this?

After the others, I thought I would stop.

-Please Please. -Why He killed?

Porque... Nicholas... Nicholas.

Push, push.

We have problems. Scalpel. Scalpel.

He beheaded the baby!

Animals! Animals!

Let Dr. ContrÃ³lese.

Bastards! Bastards! Killer Beasts!

Say yes.

Murderer! Miserable! Farsante!

They believed they could make me forget everything.

But Nicholas ...

... He asked me to die their murderers.

So I obeyed.

Now you know my secret!

Do Not! I beg you!

Ms. Petrescu. I want to ask some questions.

Get these damn reporters here.

Did you know Dr. Judd? Can you tell me something about it?

Does Dr. Judd?

Dr. Judd.

Did you work with your mother?

Worked.

Were they lovers?

Lovers.

Your mother committed the crimes?

He committed the crimes.

Your mother committed the crimes?

Eh, what happens?
