( narrator )
Now, believe it or not,
I've been known to lie.

But this here's
a true story.

The desire for food sometimes
makes strange bedfellers.

And that's where Ren Hoek
and Stimpy come in.

That's Hoek,
you idiot.

Not hoooke.

Natural enemies in the wild,

the cat and
the asthma hound chihuahua

have united in the face
of adversity.

Now, old man hunger was just
a-Gnawing at their bellies.

Why, heck, even
a dad-gum crust of bread

could look mighty
appetizing.

Excepting, of course,
if it happened to be some

other feller's lunch.

And old man pigeon wasn't
about to give up his meal.

( thunder )

Well, it looks like old man
lady luck just about run out

on these two fellers.

But always remember,

when the black, hoary
clouds of despair

darken your doorstep,

look for that
one ray of hope,

come a-shining down
from above.

â™ª Hallelujah â™ª

hot diggity dog !

I filled my quota
for the day !

( man )
You boys are gonna
like this place.

We're gonna have
a lot of fun here.

You boys like to
have fun, don't you ?

Yeah, sure.

Fun.

Anything you say.

Go ahead, have fun.

See if I care.

Yeah !

This is the life.

A square meal a day,
a roof over your head.

What do you
think, boys ?

Yes, food, shelter.

Yep, nothing can
go wrong here.

Take it from Phil !

Hey, jasper.

Where are they
taking Phil ?

He's going to sleep.

( yawning )
Oh, great.

I could use
a nap myself.

( snoring )

( rooster crowing )

Oh, my darling.

My little cucaracha.

I kiss your sleep-encrusted
eyes of morning.

I caress your
large, bulbous nose.

Let us join lips

in one final sweet
exchange of saliva.

( screaming )

I've been poisoned !

I must wash myself.

What's the matter
with you, man ?

Have you no
sense of hygiene ?

Hey, jasper,
where's Phil ?

I told you,
they put him to sleep.

So wake him up !

You don't wake up
from the big sleep.

The big sleep.

The big sleep ?

The big sleep ?

The big sleep ?

( crying )

What's the big
sleep, Ren ?

It's dead !

Dead, you idiot !

Do you know
what dead is ?

Just like we'll be,

if we don't
get outta here !

( crying )

What ?

Don't do it, Ren.

I'm covered
with hairballs.

You filthy dope !

You fat, bloated idiot !

You worm !

You stupid--

mommy, mommy, I want
the cute little poodle !

Oh, he's adorable !

I'm gonna take you home
and love you and feed you

and fix you and kiss you
and everything !

( laughing )

I'm alive, I'm alive,
I'm alive, I'm alive...

I'm out of here !

( grunting )

Stop !

You can't have me,

unless you take
Stimpy, too.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah !

Please, please,
god, please !

Mmm... okay !

Oh, just look at you
cute little things.

What's this ?

And do we have a gift for
our big, brainless puddy ?

Of course we do, yeah.

My first material
possession !

Oh, joy !

I can hardly
wait to try it.

( coughing )
