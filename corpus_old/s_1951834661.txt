I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

Yeah, you know
you got to help me out

Yeah, don't you put me
on the backburner

you know you got
to help me out, yeah, yeah

You're going to bring us all down

Yeah, yeah

You're going to bring us all down

Yeah, yeah

Don't you put me on the backburner

You're going to bring us all down,
yeah, yeah

You're going to bring us all down

Oh, oh, and then

Last call for sin

While everyone's lost

The battle is won

With all these things that I done

All these things that I've done

If you can't hold on

If you can't hold on

My face haunted his dreams.

For billions of years,
the daily cycles of the ocean tides

have influenced patterns of hunting,
breeding, and feeding behavior

among the developing
life forms of our planet.

The city is filled
with excitement and anticipation

as the hangar doors are
scheduled to open at any moment,

giving Southland residents
their first glimpse

at the Treer MegaZeppelin.

The Jenny Von Westphalen
is 900 feet long,

is lifted by turbine engines
that are activated by an energy field

that they call Fluid Karma.

Hi, Krysta.

Zora.

Come on in.

Penetrating.

It's just a suggestion.

So what do you want?

We're filming my reality webcast
before the party.

Can I score some drugs?

Sure you can, kitten.

Pandora's box had been
left exposed to prying eyes.

How did you get this?

Hey, over here.

What's with the getup?

I've got the tape
of me and Boxer in my bag.

And what are you going to do with it?

I'm thinking of going public with it.

I mean, fuck it, this could impact
the entire election.

There's a website
that everyone's talking about.

Someone's routing
outside of USIDent,

and the government
cannot figure out how to shut it out.

What's it called?

Www.usideath.org.

How do I get this to the webmaster?

Oh, it's the Neo-Marxists. They've
put drop boxes all over the city.

I think there's one in the poopdeck.

Okay, get Sheena and Deena

and meet them in Hermosa
with the cameras.

Let's do this.

Pilot Abilene is accused
of being a part of a group of soldiers

who have smuggled
the drug out of Utopia Three.

War widow Tanya McBride

is set to speak at megachurch
gathering downtown.

Hermosa Police issue
an arrest warrant for Tab Taverner.

The former mayor remains at large,
hidden by Neo-Marxists underground.

UPU units prepare for violence
during downtown celebrations...

Give me the gun.

I need your help.

I need you to help me
find my brother.

Okay.

Put on your seatbelt.

Well, Deep Throat Two,
I presume.

It's the only copy?

I don't work in distribution.

Yes, that's the only copy.

Oh, please, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

Go ahead, ask away.

How do you sleep at night?

Very well, thank you very much.

That is, until I hear
screams from next door

because USIDent
is raiding my neighbor's house,

based on false information

provided by that Orwellian nightmare
your friend endorsed.

You ever lose someone close to you,
a loved one, in a terrorist attack?

'Cause I have.

This may come as a shock to you,
Mr. Smallhouse,

but I lost two people in Abilene--

two of my four ex-husbands,
on a fishing trip,

which they took every year
to bitch about me.

What are you going to do
with all that free money?

I'm going to distribute
my documentary film,

help some women in the Middle East
get some more civil liberties.

Do you know
what those two words mean?

"Civil liberties"?

You ought to write them down.

You know what? You're going
to go down, Cyndi Pinziki.

That's right,
I know your real name.

You know,
I wasn't going to do this,

but I feel very generous today.

I'm going to leave you
with a little present.

Wow. I am flattered.
What is it?

A Taser gun to the balls.
What?

You should know that
there's another tape out there,

a far more incriminating tape
featuring your pal,

Boxer Santaros,
and a double murder,

and it's going to cost
a lot more than a million

to get your hands on that one,

because when
all is said and done,

nobody rocks the cock
like Cyndi Pinziki.

Eat shit, you fucker!

Whoa, yeah!

That little bitch, she stole it.

What?

Your friend Krysta.

She stole the tape
for her stupid reality show.

She's going to go
pranked on with it.

She probably thinks
it's the footage of her and---what?

Oh, eat a dick, Pinziki,
eat a dick!

What?

She just told me to eat a dick.

She's going completely fucking off.

You think your personal privacy
is more important

than protecting
my family from terrorists?

Well, guess again.

If the government
won't stop them, I will.

Vote no on Proposition 69.

President Bush
was received warmly

by a group of Orange County
Republican business leaders.

We've made it such

that an underground industry
thrives on human beings.

One question that the president
did not address

was the rising gas prices
starting to threaten

the GDP of the California economy.

Several small earthquakes

have been reported
off the coast of Santa Monica,

each increasing in magnitude.

Seismologists
are warning Southland residents

of another massive earthquake,

noting tidal disturbances
emanating

from the Utopia Three facility
on the Pacific coast.

I felt a premonition.

Danger was on the horizon.

Man, this is great.

Shit, Boxer Santaros.

Jericho Kane.

The information that I've uncovered
could get me killed,

but it was a risk I was willing to take.

The fate of the world
depends on you, Jericho.

Yes.

You must board the MegaZeppelin.

The secret you are looking for is
hidden in the Baron's private chamber.

What is the secret?

There's a dead body
they've retrieved from the desert.

They found the body in your car.

Did I kill someone out there?

They're listening.

They're watching.

If you should succeed,
remember me, my love.

Remember my name.

I will.

L--

I want to suck your dick.

If you don't let me suck your dick,
I'm going to kill myself.

W-w--wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

Target locked.

Take your pants off right now,
or I'm going to pull the trigger.

Take them off.

Okay.

Jericho Kane...

is going to make your wish
come true...

and turn you into a new woman.

We could rent a room at Shutters.
It's my favorite place.

All right, we are trailing
Zora Charmichaels and Bart Bookman.

They are driving a silver pickup truck

looking to rendezvous
with Krysta Kapowski,

a.k.a. Krysta Now,
blonde, 5'4", 110 pounds.

Apparently there is
a tape in her possession.

That is the target.

There's here car.
Bitch.

All right, now it's on.
Let's go.

God, this is
so revolutionary, Krysta.

We have a Steadicam.

I know, but when I said Steadicam,
I didn't at My First Steadicam.

I want a real one,
like a real movie.

I mean, TV show,
but it's like a movie.

You know,
these kind of new technologies

are totally changing culture now.

Yeah, especially now
that everything is digital.

That sausage makes me hungry.

Right down there, to the right,
behind the toilet, feed the hole.

Oh, yeah.

Do you see this scene?
Yeah.

It feels good.
It's hot.

Sir, those people
are trying to kill me.

Whoa.

Get the fuck out of my way,
you bitch.

Do you know who we are?

What's your hurry, bitch?
Oh, don't you--

Anybody else
want to take a swing at me?

Krysta, it's the wrong tape,
you stupid whore.

Come on and get me, fucks.

Fascist pigs.

Oh, my God!

Go, go!

Why did I buy this car?

Come on.

Grid nine zero two
six six...

Hello?
Fortunio.

Hey, hey.
Boxer.

I'm at 26th Street,
on The Strand, okay?

Okay, bye.

Fortunio was
on the Baron's payroll all along.

Put him up. Put him up.

His orders
were to deliver the specimen

to Treer Plaza before sundown.

Up, up, up.

Watch it.

There's no turning back now.

You're a good friend.

Cyndi had obtained a ticket

to the launch
of the Jenny Von Westphalen.

Unfortunately,
she did not have a plus one.

Darkness fell upon the city.

Neo-Marxist cells
began to converge upon downtown.

Treer Corporation would like
to thank the mayor,

the City of Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce,

and all the sponsors
who have supported the launch.

All proceeds will benefit
the victims' families...

The Eliot campaign
will celebrate the holiday

with a memorial concert
at the Taper Center.

Eliot will attend
the concert with his family,

while Senator Frost will attend
the launch of the Treer MegaZeppelin

just several blocks away.

Paranoia
began to consume their lives.

Thousands gather
to witness the maiden voyage

of America's technological marvel,
the Southland's newest wonder,

the Treer MegaZeppelin.

...the hills above Los Angeles today,
while on the ground

authorities are bracing
for the first riots since 1992.

You can see right there, a car bomb
went off just moments ago.

So why do you want to kill yourself?

I got drafted, dog.

I got to go to Iraq,
maybe Syria.

I can't take that shit.

I'd rather put a bullet
in my head quick and painless.

Fallujah.

You were in Iraq?

Yo, how'd you get out, dog?

That's none of your business.

Just try and cross the border
into Mexico.

That's where
my brother and I are headed.

Yo, I don't have a visa, dog.

You said something
while you were asleep.

"We saw the shadows
of the morning light...

"the shadows of the evening sun...

until the shadows
and the light were one."

What does that mean?

"Three days."

The final three days.

It all ends tonight.

It's gonna be a hot time
in the city tonight.

Job well done, Miss Now.

Is he gonna be okay?

Well, as they say,
only time will tell.

What does this mean?

There is a path to end all suffering.

You should take it.

Behold the Eighth
Wonder of the World--

Treer MegaZeppelin!

Did you retrieve the DVD
from Deep Throat Two?

Affirmative, Cyndi.
I'm going to be going live

with three tales
from the Southland this evening.

How long will the website be active

before USIDent
can route in and shut it down?

Are you kidding me?
Who are you talking to?

Don't worry your
pretty little head over it.

You go enjoy the rest
of the party. I'm out.

To be honest...

we're just looking out
for the niggers.

This is my deal now...

Santaros.

More than a hundred thousand
people have gathered

to be at the largest block party
in the history of Los Angeles.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.

Farewell, one and only beloved.

I cannot write anymore,

or my head will be
all in a whirl, and...

Adieu, adieu my sweetheart.

Jenny.

You try so hard to be heard

You try so hard to not hurt

I give you nothing to doubt,
and you doubt me

I'll give you all that I have,
but you don't see

Now I know
that my eyes must close here

Every word seems to feel
like you don't care

But I know that
you're so confused and afraid

I just want to be one true thing
that don't fade

I don't want to give up tomorrow

I just can't understand
why we're going on

Thank you.

I don't wanna be sad

I don't wanna be scared

I don't wanna be sad

I don't wanna be scared

I don't wanna be sad

I don't wanna be scared

I don't wanna be sad

I don't wanna be scared

I don't wanna be sad

I don't wanna be scared

I don't' wanna be sad

I don't wanna be scared

Mr. Boxer Santaros
has arrived.

Excellent.

How does it end?

A handshake.

I had a dream last night
that you died.

Mr. Santaros.

Your presence
is requested in the Marx Suite.

Alone.

I'm not going to die.

...he was on fire.

The surrounding stores,

you could see people running
in and out of the broken windows.

What is going on--

And there's another--
another explosion just took off

down--right down there
off of Third Street.

Revelation 22--

"Very soon now
shall I be with you again...

"bringing the reward
to be given to every man

according to what he deserves."

Mr. Santaros,
welcome to the Marx Suite.

Now, Simon says
lower your sidearm, please.

Are you just deaf
or willfully stupid?

I told you to lower
that fucking sidearm!

And there you go.

Well, come on in.

They're trying to rig the election.

California is too close to call.

All--all right, sweetheart,
whatever you say.

Why isn't she here?

She won't leave her post.

It is time for a surgical strike.

I can smell you
from down the hall.

No. Not now, Dennis.

The Neo-Marxists
have infiltrated USIDent.

She has to leave there immediately.

It's okay. She has
everything under control.

We need to get her out of there.

There are thousands, probably
tens of thousands of protesters

all up and down the street

and spreading out
into the surrounding arteries

coming in
toward the downtown area.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Treer MegaZeppelin.

The project was called
Serpentine Dream Theory.

The Tidal Generator
within Utopia Three

has achieved
simulated perpetual motion.

The impact of this achievement

has slowed the acceleration
of the planet to such a degree

that certain environmental anomalies
have started to surface.

One of these anomalies,
discovered earlier this year,

was a rift in the fourth dimension.

A rift in the fabric of space-time...

half a kilometer wide.

Located on the outskirts
of Lake Mead.

Yes, Mr. Santaros.

Just like you imagined
in your screenplay.

And what did we do

once we discovered a rift
in the fourth dimension?

We launched monkeys into it.

Only a human subject
could survive that jaunt.

The soul of a monkey

can't survive
the dimensional threshold.

So we learned,

at which point the Baron decided

that the first human subject
to travel through the rift

would be a movie star.

Why me?

Your celebrity
and your political ties

proved an irresistible combination.

As the satellite photos show,

at approximately 10:51 a.m.--

and this is 69 minutes
before you passed through the rift--

a duplicate Boxer Santaros
appeared.

You traveled 69 minutes
back in time, sir,

at which point your future self...

and your past self
confronted one another.

So I'm my future self.

And I'm the dude
who traveled through the rift.

And this is all that's left
of your past self.

This body, this artifact,

this dual existence
of a single human soul

could unlock the secret of creation,
the secret of humankind.

I don't understand.

I've never considered
committing suicide.

I'm a pimp.

And pimps don't commit suicide.

We don't know what would happen
if two identical human souls

and the vessels that they travel in

were to come into immediate
close contact with one another.

Indy 103.1--the independent FM.
Fourth of July weekend...

Where did you get this?

Pilot Abilene.

Pilot Abilene?

Do you bleed?

You can fly so bloody

What happened
in Fallujah was an accident.

They called it friendly fire,

and Private Taverner
could not forgive himself

for what he had done to me.

Yo, dog, where are we headed?

Somewhere downtown.

We have to go downtown.

He's in an ice cream truck.

Wow, I can feel it.

There is automatic weapon fire,
we understand,

down on the ground,
and we just heard...

...the power and the kingdom
of your God...

Yo, dog, I'm going
to empty out my account...

take everything I got.

Neat.

Welcome
to the Rove Credit Union.

Please have
your USIDent card ready

in order to make your transaction.

...is the promise
in the Word of God!

Welcome,
Martin Kefauver, welcome.

Martin Kefauver,
welcome, welcome, welcome...

Kefauver and card ready...

Yo, dog, it says--it says
"transaction denied," dog.

Yo, what--what do I do?

We're going to take
the ATM machine with us to Mexico.

Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for the national anthem.

I give you Rebekah Del Rio.

...whose broad stripes
and bright stars

Through the perilous fight

O'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming

And the rockets’ red glare

The bombs bursting in air

Gave proof through the night

That our flag was still there

Oh, say, does that
star-spangled banner

Yet wave?

O'er the land of the free

And the home of the brave

We've got a perimeter breach
at Caltrans Building.

I repeat,
we've got a perimeter breach.

Die, you fucking pig!

Uh-oh, wait.

Apparently we've lost
contact with Sky Cam.

As you could see
just before we lost the picture,

a lot of people downtown,
a lot of activity,

all kinds of problems.

Please stay indoors.
Stay inside.

And, you know, we're getting
information that the Neo-Marxist...

You know.

You know exactly what happened
out in the desert.

Who did the Baron hire
to kidnap me?

And who drove me
through the time rift?

You haven't figured that out yet?

What is his name?

Officer Roland Taverner.

Officer Roland Taverner.
How are you?

Ice cream truck.

Teri?

Teri, you've gone too far.

Ladies and gentlemen,
we seem to be having...

Is he still alive?

In more ways than one.

You made sure Taverner
went through the time rift with me.

Then you hit the SUV
self-destruct trigger, by remote,

which means...

I didn't kill myself.

You're a pimp.

Pimps don't commit suicide.

Oh, you got that right.

And Roland Taverner...
and his twin brother...

they're the same person,
aren't they?

Two identical souls
walking the face of the earth,

coexisting in the same
dominion of chaos.

What will happen
if they shake hands?

The fourth dimension
will collapse upon itself.

You stupid bitch.

Again, don't be alarmed,
but stay inside.

The ocean is in control.

...the rioting continues downtown,
and it's a problem right now

because it looks like
the crowds are growing.

Even though we no longer
have contact with our chopper,

we do understand it was
the Neo-Marxist movement

that started these riots.

They're continuing to move
throughout downtown Los Angeles...

And this is the tower of fire.

We have to evacuate.

What in God's name
are you talking about?

There he is. Let's go.

We've got automatic weapons fire
at Fourth Street and Hill.

I think they're already inside.

Recommend open fire
into the crowd.

No.

Run!

Yo, yo, dog, you all right?

Well done, soldier.

Take that target.

You can't miss.

Come on, let's go, let's go!

Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Krysta Now,

Shoshanna Cox,
Sheena Gee, and Deena Score.

They are
the Memory Gospel Dancers.

Let's-- let's leave right now.

This guy right here
might never leave.

It had to be this way.

I know.

He's going to die.

There's nothing
we can do about it?

Is it some kind of an orgy
or something?

What the hell's he doing?

Evacuate the atrium.
Move to the rear of the MegaZeppelin.

No.

Everybody, go back to your seats.

Or I kill myself,
and I swear to God...

I'll do it.

We have to let go.

I can't.

You have to let me go.

But the truck will fall,
and we'll both die.

Let me go,
or I'll pull this fucking trigger!

No, you won't.
I swear to God I'll do it!

No, you won't.

Ladies and gentlemen,
the party is over.

Have a nice apocalypse.

Put down the gun.

This is all in my head.

I can pull the trigger now
and wake up.

This whole nightmare
will be over.

Our mission
is to destroy capitalism.

Dethrone God.

Officer Roland Taverner.

That's who you want.

Don't you remember, Ronald?

Do you remember Fallujah?

I remember everything.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the way the world ends.

Not with a whimper,
but with a bang.

But there is hope.

In the end we can be reassured
by one undeniable truth.

Nobody rocks the cock
like Krysta Now.

And I mean nobody.

I knew that son of a bitch was crazy.
Get me out of here.

It wasn't our fault.

It wasn't our fault.

Friendly fire.

I forgive you.

Friendly fire.

I forgive you.
Friendly fire.

Friendly fire.
I forgive you.

Friendly fire.
I forgive you.

I forgive you.

I forgive you.

Revelation 21--

And God wiped away
the tears from his eyes,

so the new messiah could see
out to the New Jerusalem.

His name was
Officer Roland Taverner

of Hermosa Beach, California...

my best friend.

He is a pimp...

and pimps don't commit suicide.
