not far from that park.

I told myself I was there
that day like every other day

to look out
for her safety.

The truth was,

I just couldn't get her
out of my system

No.



[gun clicks]

Give me your money, man.

Fuck you.

Fuck me?
Fuck you!

Give me your money,

or I'm going to blow your
goddamned brains out right here.

Fine.

Do it.

Come on;
what are you waitingfor?

Blow my fucking
brains out.

Come on; do it.

You worthless
piece of shit.

thud!

[men's distant murmuring]

(man #l)
Look at that guy.


(man #2)
Oh, he's messed up, man.

(man #3)
That's bad;
that's bad.

I'm a cop.

This man
is under arrest.

The guy
was resistingarrest.

He pulled a gun on me.

Cut the bullshit, Hank.

We both know
why you were out there

in that park.

Whatever.

Hey, I got
a report to finish.

Wake up and smell
the attorneys.

You know,
move on with your life.

Susan's moved on
with hers.

You should do the same.

You know, if you ask me,
you're better off.

I never saw you two
together anyway.

I didn't ask.

Have it your way.

I'll suspend you

and let the review board
take it over.

What?

You can't be serious.

You're takingme off duty?

You want to have
your finger

hovering over
the self-destruct button,

I can't stop you.

But I can sure as hell stop you
from takinganybody with you.

Okay, okay,
wait a second.

I admit, I got a little
carried away today in the park.

But, Captain, come on.

You can't take me
off duty.

I'll go frickin' nuts.

Sit down.

What about the drinking?

What drinking?

Come on, Hank.

I can smell it on you.

All right;
all right.

I'll quit right now,
cold turkey.

No problem

Just don't take me
off duty.

You going to get out of the car
and get yourself an apartment,

and stop stalking
your ex-wife?

All of the above.

Don't make me regret this.

You won't.

I'll come down on you
like the hammers ofhell.

Hey, not so fast.

This will take your mind
off your ex-wife for a while.

Her name is Layla Simmons.

She's a local
college girl.

She disappeared
a couple weeks ago

after going to one
of those raves in Hollywood.

Any evidence of foul play?

No, just disappeared,
no trace.

I can't send the graybeards
on this for obvious reasons.

I want you to go see
what you can find out.

You got it.

But no bullshit
this time.

By the book.

I want your word on it.

Absolutely.

No, no, no, no.

I want to hear you say it.

Okay, you got my word.

I give you my word.

You get cleaned up,

you might think about
getting laid.

It did wonders for me
after my divorce.

Thanks,John,
I'll think about that.

And now back
to
The Melissa Rivers Show.

[woman #2 on TV]
Our next guest's book,
the new detective best-seller,

is all based on
the macabre world

of vampires, ghouls,
and werewolves.

Her new book,
Love of a Vampire,

has the critics calling
her everythingfrom brilliant

to pornographic.

Welcome Susan Hastings.

Thank you.


(woman #2)
Let's cut
to my favorite topic:

sex.

You seem to be
very obsessed with vampires.

I mean, you really romanticize
them in your books.

As a matter of fact,
in the new book,

the heroine not only falls
in love with a vampire;

she has sex
with a vampire,

which you call--let me
make sure I've got this--

''transcending
anything imaginable

in this mere
mortal world.''

Okay, Susan,
come on.

This has got to be
something you have

fantasized about
more than once.

I've just been fascinated
with vampires

since I was a little girl.

Do you think
it's the whole bad boy image?

I mean, that's something we can
all related to, right, girls?

And speaking ofbad boys--
your dating life.

You have dated the most
eligible bachelors

in Hollywood.

And right now,
the rumor on the street,

TVheartthrob
Jake Vincent.

Yeah,Jake and I
are seeing each other.

splud!

[Big Huggy Snuggle Bunny's

Everything that's beautiful
is everything that's wrong.

Finger on the trigger;

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Ahh.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Dancin' with a dead girl.

Damn.

Look out!

What the hell?

[men muttering]

You're under arrest,

Ah,fuck you.

You gonna get up?

(man #2)
No, man.


[man #l laughs]

Who the hell are you?

Whoa.

That was a hell of a left hook
you threw back there.

Yeah?

There's more
where that came from

Look, I'd like to talk to you
for a second.

(man #3)
There a problemhere?

Who the fuck are you?

Your worst nightmare

if you don't get your hands
off of my sister.

Your sister?

Okay, I can respect that.

It's getting late.

To the bat cave, then.


Yeah, I have a date.

The more the merrier,
I always say.

What are you waitingfor?

Do you want
to fuck me or not?


Well, actually I just
wanted to talk to you.

But I suppose

we could do that
in the limo.

Are you sure
your brother won't mind?

He's not my brother.

[Woven's

Hey, bro.

Run around.

Run around.


Can't be found.

It can't be found.

The more I stare,
she disappears.

Wait a minute;
wait a minute.

No embrace,
no embrace.

Across the fields
of everything.

[gate clanks]

[ominous music]

Nice place.

Who does your decorating?

What are you doing?

The party's this way.

What's the matter?

Don't you want
to play with Layla?

[wind whistles]

[The Smokey Notes'Right Here]

Ahh.

Ahh.

I'm under your skin,

and you go within.

There's nothing

Wait a minute;
wait a minute.

I'mright here.

Look at me.

[cat yowls]

[footsteps echo]

[footsteps clomp]

Freeze!

Drop your weapon.

You drop yours.

I'm a cop.

You're a cop?

Where's your badge?

Nice and easy.

All right, you want
to put that gun down now?

Damn, man,
what the hell happened to you?

I'mnot sure myself.

Sorry about that.

Now, how the hell
did you say you got in here?

There were some people
in here, suspects.

Not ten minutes ago,
I seemed to have lost them

You didn't happen to see--

You're the only one
I've seen.

Of course, I just came on duty
about ten minutes ago.

You didn't see anyone
leave the building?

Nope, everything
was locked up

just the way
it's supposed to be.

We're the only ones
with keys.

That's why
I can't figure out

how the hell
you got in here.

You have
a cell phone handy?

Sure.

[buttons beeping]

[helicopter whirring]

[distant sirens]

Hey, Captain.

You sure about everything
you've told us?

Yeah, why?


They've gone through this whole
buildingand found nothing.

Maybe the suspects got away
when you were knocked out.

No, there wasn't enough time.

The security guard
didn't see anyone leave either.

Right.

In fact,
the security guard said

the only one
he saw at all was you.

I'm telling you,

I couldn't have been out
for more than a couple seconds.

And there were
30 people in that room

Trust me.

There still
in there somewhere.

You know, I rolled on this
personally, because it was you.

So one more time
so I get it clear--

now, you came here with
the missinggirl, Layla Simmons,

and a couple she met
at the rave.

There was an orgy
takingplace inside.

You heard a scream
somewhere nearby.

You saw blood,
a throat being cut.

You drew your weapon.

A fight ensued.

Layla Simmons attacked you.

You fired at her
three times point-blank.

You wounded
several other people.

Right, everything
I said before.

[distant whirring]

What happened
to Layla Simmons' body?

Like I said,
I came to and...

And someone moved
the body, right.

Captain, you know me.

I'm telling you, those people
are still in there somewhere,

and we're wasting time standing
around here talkingabout it.

[siren approaches]

See you at
the station, Captain.

You know what?

I'll do this myself,
if I have to.

[Layla laughs]

What are you waitingfor?

Don't you want
to play with Layla?



Look at me.

clang!

Hank?

Huh?

What are you doing?

[Layla laughs]

Do you hear that?

Did you hear that?

What?

[Layla laughing]

What?

Come on.

What are you waitingfor?

[women screaming]

[screaming continues]


Ahh!

Hank.

Get up.


Come on.

We've been combing
from top to bottom

The security guard
gave a tour.

There's no one
inside this place.

I know what I saw.

There had to be
50 people in that room

You said 30 before.

50, 30--
it was dark.

What difference
does it make?

And half of them
were, uh...

Were what?

Hank, what were they?

Listen, if there's something
you're not tellingme,

now's the time.

Okay.

This is going to sound crazy,
but I think they were, uh...

Were what?

Vampires.


Vampires.

Yeah, look, I know
that sounds crazy,

but how do you
explain this?

I thought you said
you got that in a scuffle.

Then again, drunks fall
down all the time, don't they?

I wasn't drunk.

You had nothing to drink
last night?

Hmm?

You better
come clean, Hank,

because I had
the paramedic out there.

He took a blood sample
from your neck.

A blood sample?

Shots were fired.

It's out of my hands.

If there's something
you're not tellingme,

now's the time.

All right;
all right.

I had a couple beers,

and there was
some marijuana.

Marijuana?

This girl, Layla, she put
some kind of spell on me,

I'm telling you.

When I looked into her eyes,
it was like--

Are you tellingme
a college girl bit your neck?

No, that was
this other thing.

It wasn't even human.

It must have been
their leader or something.

It picked me up and starting
sucking the blood fromme.

And then the sun came--

Enough;
enough!


John, I know this sounds insane,
but you got to believe me.

You know what I believe?

I believe
you lied to me.

I believe
you were drinking,

and I believe
you were smoking dope.

Whatever.

And you woke up here
for some reason,

and the security guard
happened by.

And you came up
with this ridiculous story

to save your ass.

No, no,John,
I'm telling you,

this girl had
some kind of powers.

Captain.

What?

Give it to me.

[plastic crinkling]

You recognize these?

.380 slugs?

Yeah,from your .380.

The forensics have been
digging them out of the wall

in that room where
you tell me that you

and your vampires
were partying.

The walls.

Right, you told me
you hit her point-blank.

Isn't that
what you said?

I put three shots
into that girl point-blank,

and I emptied my clip
in several others.

Any signs
ofblood or tissue?

Nothing.

Let me see your gun.

What?

You know the drill.

[bullets clacking]

I'mrelieving you
of duty.

John--

As of this moment.

We're done here.

Let me see your badge.

Give it to me.

John.

Come on.

You ever want
to see this again,

you get yourself some help--
and I mean professional help.

You take a month;
take as longas you need.

But if you ever even think of
trying to come back on the job,

you better get
your shit together.

John, listen--

Do we understand
each other?

Yeah.

Come on;
let's go.

Let's go;
let's go.




[eerie music]

clunk!

[beer fizzes]




Hiya, lover boy.

A shame you threw
that beer away.

I'm a little
parched myself.

That's part of it,
the thirst.

At first it's beer,
water, whatever.

Then it's--

Hank.

You know what they say
about boys who play with guns.

They're just
overcompensatingfor--

well, but then we both know that
you don't have that problem

don't we, Hank?

I shot you three times.

I know.

That really wasn't
very nice.

Back off.

Hank, you are really
starting to bore me.

Please put the gun down.

I'm warning you.

I promise I'll be good.

whack!

Besides, if I wanted
to kill you,

I would have done it
way before now.

Tsk.

Oh, poor baby.

Does it hurt much?

I remember when
I was first bitten.

I thought
I was going to die.

Well, actually,
I sort of did,

but only for a few days.

This is
the worst part, though.

The next few days
are going to feel like years,

and then it happens so fast, you
don't even know what hit you.

You wake up, and it's like
you start a whole new life.

One day you're drinking beer
like it's going out of style,

and the next, it's the blood
of some sweet young thing.

What the hell
is happening to me?

You don't know?

You're becoming
one of us.

That's why
I can't hurt you.

The Master won't let us
hurt one of our own kind.

Don't fight it, Hank.

It's actually
quite beautiful.

Live forever.

Never grow old.

Party every night.


And the sex.

Hank, let me tell you,

you have never
had sex like this.

Undead head--
it's un-fucking-believable.

You're not real.

No one can move
that fast.

Fast?

You think this is fast?

You should see The Master.

He's over 700 years old.

But don't worry.

Eventually you'll be able
to do everything I can do.

I'll never be like you.

Drop the weapon.

Don't make us
tell you again.

[police radio drones]

Officer, there's
a woman you have to--

Put the gun down.

Okay;
okay.

What's the matter?

Cat got your tongue?


Shoot her.

She's a vampire!

Ahh!


There she is behind you.



Ahh!

Look at it, Hank.


Doesn't it
look delicious?


You still here?

What'd you do?

Stay here and party
all night or something?

Where are they?

Who?

The two cops

that were killed.

They were right here
last night.

She killed them
right here.

I don't want
no trouble, all right?

You can't keep hanging
around here.

How come there are no
security guards here at night?

Last night, the night before,
there were no security guards.

I don't know, man.

I just punch the clock
in the mornings,

do my thing,
then I go home--

which is what
you'd better do

before I call
that captain of yours.

Man, you need a shower

or something.

Don't you have a wife

you can go home to?

What did you say?

Look, man, if you want to
smell bad, that's your business.

My wife.

Yeah.

Why didn't I
think of that?

Don't be expecting to get
no pussy smelling like that,

crazy, mother-fucking
bitch-ass white boy.

[car engine starts]


Jesus, Hank.

What are you
doing here?

I need your help.

You look awful.

What happened to you?

Yeah, well, that's why
I need your help.

You're not making
any sense.

And I wish to God
you'd stop stalkingme.

I-I-I wasn't
stalking you.

I was never stalking you.

I was just--

Good-bye, Hank.

Wait; wait;
wait; wait.

I need to talk to you.

Let go of my arm

Okay, okay.

I don't know
how to say this.

It's going
to sound crazy.

I was bitten
by a vampire.


I know;
I know; I know.

Just hear me out.

My neck, look.

Look at my neck.

Oh, that looks infected.

Have you seen a doctor?

I don't need a doctor.

I need you.

You've written
all those books on vampires.

You're an expert.

Hank, this is so pathetic.

I have nowhere else
to turn.

Please, I'm telling
you the truth.

You're really starting
to scare me.

Now, I'm warning you,
don't come any closer.

Just give me
five minutes.

Tell me what to do.

They have these special powers,
and their strength is...

I'm sorry I never read
any of your books.

And I'm--

I'm sorry that I was
married to my job.

I'm sorry for whatever
I did to make you leave me.

Just please help me.

Is this guy
bothering you, ma'am?

Yes.

Buddy, why don't
you just move along?

This is none
of your business.

Well, I'mmaking it
my business.

Ah!

Whoa!

Susan--


Ahh!

[continues yelling]

[engine starts]

[vehicle approaches]

[police radio
drones distantly]

(man #l)
Show me your hands.

Get out of the car.

Get out of the car.

(man #2)
Turn around.

I said, ''Turn around.''

Hands on the car.

Get your hands
on the car.

[door slams]

Susan?

Sit down.

I'm sorry, Hank.

You didn't leave me
much choice.

Susan swore out a complaint
against you for stalking her.

Captain Billings and I
have been talking.

I'm willing to drop the
complaint if you'll get help.

This has got
to stop, Hank.

[books slam]

Susan, I bought those books
to try and find out--

You're living out of your car
with tinfoil on the windows.

You've admitted
not sleeping.

You're abusing
drugs and alcohol,

and now this with Susan.

We have some people on
the way here who can help you.

People on the way?

You mean like men in white suits
with butterfly nets?

That kind of people?

This is
an intervention.

It could be very civilized...

or get very ugly.

Susan, what I was trying
to tell you today is true.

It's really
happening to me.


What's the matter?

The mirror.

What?

Hank had
no reflection.

What?

Oh, God.

I need some water.

Look at my neck.

Just get me some
fucking water, please.

Ahh!

I want to withdraw
my complaint.

What?

You can release him
to my custody.

I'll take
full responsibility.

Listen, he's a friend.

I'm trying to help him

What are you doing?

We're not
legally divorced yet.

Technically,
I'm still his wife.

Please;
I've changed my mind.

You can't hold himhere if
I withdraw the complaint, right?

Right.

Then that's what
I want to do.


Maybe you two are
meant for each other after all.

I know what happened
to Haskell and Wexler.

What?

The two cops
that went missing.

They were killed

by one of the same vampires
that did this to me.

Get him out ofhere.

John, I was there.

I saw it happen.

Get out ofhere
before I change my mind.

Come on, we have
a lot to talk about.

What about my gun?

They took my gun.

You won't need that.

You don't understand.

They'll come for me.

No, Hank,
it won't do any good.

I think I'm gonna be sick.

[vomiting
and coughing]


Oh, God.


Drink this.



Stop it, Hank.

Let go.

Susan.


Susan.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry you're--

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay.

Oh, my God.

Hank, you have
to drink this.

What is it?

Wolfsbane.

Wolfsbane?

Just drink it.

We have to get you
coherent enough

so you can tell me everything
you know about those vampires.


You believe me?

Open your mouth.

You're becoming one of them

We don't have much time,
so drink it.

It'll help
slow down the process.

Oh!


Where the hell are we?

A motel--

pretty sleazy one
at that.

I couldn't risk
taking you to the house.

Captain Billings
might have changed his mind.

No one will think
to look for you here,

and no one will care
if you start screaming.

Screaming?

What's that for?

Show me the bite marks
on your neck again.

Why?

Hank, do you trust me?

I trust you.

Then just do it--

and don't watch.

Something tells me
I'mnot going to like this.

[Hank yelling]

[yelling continues]

Mr. Vincent,

you ain't gonna
like this.

She's shacked up

in some
fleabag hotel.

So it is the guy
from the park.

Yeah, one and the same.

You want I should go in
and take care

of this son of a bitch?

Stay where you are.

I'm going
to meet you there.

[phone beeps]

smack!
Hank.

smack!
Hank!

crash!

Oh, my neck.

Oh.


What did you
do that for?

It will help slow down--

Slow down
the process, right.

[glass clinking]

Ow.

How's that make you feel?

I don't know.

Nauseous.

Good.

Now who doesn't trust who?

It's just a precaution.

Look, I need to know everything
you know about those vampires--

how many there are,

where do they hunt.

I don't know.

There must have
been a dozen--

that I could see anyway.

And they hunt
at these raves.

Raves?

These parties
that go all--

No, I know
what raves are.

I was just thinking
about that

beinga great idea
for one of my books.

Trust me.

You'll have plenty
to write about

if we make it
through this.

During the day,
where do they sleep?

I don't know.

But I could tell you
where they party at night:

this old,
abandoned hospital

downtown.

Oh, that's original.

Wait till you
see their leader.

He's like nothing
I've ever seen before.

I don't know what he is,
but he's definitely not human.

It's fascinating.

Well, he's the one
who bit you.

Yeah.

That's the only reason
you're still alive.

If one of the others
had bitten you,

you'd been dead on the spot.

I thought they could all,
you know,

turn you into one of them
if they wanted to.

No, according to my research,
it has to be the leader.

And even then,
he'll usually kill you

unless he chooses you
to join them

I don't know
about the choosingpart.

What do you mean?

When we were struggling,
I knocked the curtain aside,

and the sun came in and hit him
in the middle ofbitingme.

And now he won't hurt you,

because you're like
one ofhis offspring.

He created you.

No, he must be very old,

perhaps as much
as l,000 years,

which means he's much stronger
than the others.

Yeah, they all move
like warp speed.

One second
they're right next to you.

The next, they're clear
across the room

Hypnotism

It's a form ofhypnotism

They put their victims
into a trance.

Yeah, with their eyes.

Been there;
done that.

What are you doing?

So far,
from what you've told me,

they've done pretty much
exactly what I'd expect them to.

It'd be my guess they're going
to come lookingfor you.

How do you know?

Because the leader
will send them

He'll sense that someone's
helping you fight it,

so he'll send
the others to stop me--

which is exactly
what I want him to do.

You want them to find us?

Well, they're the only ones that
can tell us where the leader is,

which is the only way to save
you from becoming one of them

You have to find
the leader,

find where he sleeps
during the day,

and kill him

Now, there are three things
that vampires don't like:

crucifixes, garlic,
and holy water.

But all those things will do
is keep them at bay.

If you want to kill them

you have to expose them
to sunlight.

Or drive a wooden stake
through their heart.

Or cut their heads off.

I can't believe we're even
having this conversation.

Why are you doing this?

What?

You've been avoidingme
like the plague

for almost a year.

Why are you helpingme?

Are you kidding?

This is the most
incredible thing

that's ever happened
to me.

I'mmean, to think
I've been writing

about all of this
as fiction,

and now to know

it actually exists.

What's the matter?

Nothing.

I just thought that maybe
this was about you and me.

Well, yeah, Hank,
of course.

That too.

It's just, I've really
missed you, you know?


Can Hank come out and play?

Remember, we don't
want to kill them

till they've told us
where their master is.

Something tells me that's going
to be easier said than done.

[electric fizzle]

[wind whistling]

Wait here.

I thought we had something,

you and me.

And now I catch you
shacking up with Goldilocks.


Ah!

Let her go.

Oh, isn't that sweet?

I think he actually cares
about this little bitch.

Yes, very touching.

But I don't think

you're in much of a position
to be making demands here, Hank.

Mmm

Yummy.

Alex, honey,

do you want to do
the honors, or should I?

[both yelling]

Look for a little head
there, Hank?


[sword clatters]

Whoa, ooh, Hank.

You're gettingstronger,
aren't you?

Yeah, it's always the body
that changes first.

Don't worry.

The soul
will soon follow.

Poppin' fresh.

Isn't this ironic?


You have made yourself
rich and famous

by exploiting us
and glamorizing us.

And now...

mmm you've ended up
on the menu.

Please, wait, no.

You don't understand.

I want to talk to you.

Save some for me.


crash!

Stay.


Oh!

I can't see!

Huh, now I'mmad.

You've made me soil

my favorite shirt.


Hank!

Uh!

Bitch.

Hank, we're brothers.

No, Hank, don't look

into his eyes.



Jake!

What the hell
is going on here?

Jake, watch out.


Ah!




Ahh!

Can't we all
just get along?



[sword clatters]

splat!


Looks like a home run
to me, sports fans.




Uh!

No more games, Hank.

Take a good whiff.

It smells heavenly,
doesn't it?


It smells like--

[sniffs deeply]

like lilacs
in the spring,

like a T-bone steak
cooked rare over an open flame.

That's all you're going
to want fromnow on, Hank.

No more standing
in grocery lines

with your pitiful
little vegetables.

Look at how much
Layla loves it.


No, Hank, look away.


The sun's coming up soon.

Our work here is done.


What are we going
to do about her?

She could stay here
with him

wait it out.

Be his first meal.


I like it.


There's no turning back
now, Hank.

Another 24 hours,

and you're one of us.

You'll know where to find us
when the time comes.



slam!

Susan.

Susan!

Susan.

Oh, my God.

Susan, listen to me.

You've got to go.

What?

You have to go.

You can't stay here.

No.

I can feel it
happening.

I'm becoming
one of them

You can't be around me.

There's no telling
what I might do.

We can stop it.

We have to stop it.

You can't stop it.

It's impossible.

Not if we find
their master and kill him

We don't know
where he is.

He could be
anywhere in L.A.

Think.

There must be
something they said.

What about the hospital?

No, no, we searched that.

I'm sure that's it.

The Master never goes far
fromhis nest.

He'd be much
too conspicuous.

That's why he has the others
bring him the victims.

He was there
at the hospital.

That has to be
the nest.

Wait a second.

There's a security guard
during the day,

but not at night.

They don't need one at night,
just during the day to--

To keep anyone from discovering
their restingplace.

Right.

No.

No, you have to fight it.

Drink this.

Oh, my God.

Okay.

You ready?

Yeah.

I want to stop

at a sportinggoods store
along the way

to pick up some more tools
of the trade.

I don't get it.

There was only one of them
the other day.

They must have
beefed up security

after what happened
with you.

Yeah.

But who do they work for?

And do you think they know
who they're guarding?

There's only one way
to find out.

What are you doing?

They could be wraiths.

Wraiths?

What the hell's
a wraith?

It's sort oflike a demon.

Vampires have
been known to employ them

during the day to guard their
nests in exchange for leftovers.

Leftovers?

You mean like--

Eat human flesh.

Yean, I'm afraid so.

Well, why didn't he
try and kill me yesterday?

Well, he must have
seen your bite marks

and figured that the leader had
chosen you to join the family.

All right.

No, you have
to stay here.

They already know you.

Well, what are you
going to do?

If they're wraiths,

they won't like crucifixes
any more than vampires do.

I'mnot so sure
I like this idea.

It's okay.

I won't get too close.

Hey.

Be careful.

I will.

Excuse me.

Could you help me?

My car seems
to have overheated,

and I'm a little bit lost.

Sure, where would
you like to go?

Well, I need to find the--

I can't help you, lady.

Beat it.

What?

You heard me.

What seems to be
the problemhere?

This is private property.

I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

That is so rude.

Do you have a superior
that I could talk to?

[monstrous voice]
Don't make me tell you again.

Okay.

[door clicks open]

What's the verdict?

Oh, they're wraiths
all right.

Which means we're gonna have to
kill them if we want to get in.

Afraid so.

But it's not gonna be easy.

Why is that?

Well, supposedly

they're twice as strong
as a normal person.

And their blood
is poisonous.

Poisonous?

More like acid, really.

But there is one thing
that might be in our favor.

They don't like heights.


[suspenseful music]

Come on.

Hmm

[wet crunching]




[demonic screaming]


[gun clicks]

You're really
starting to get

on my nerves, lady.

I thought you said
they didn't

like heights.

I can't know everything.


Shoot him!


clack!


Ahh!

crash!

It looks like some kind
of a subbasement.

You didn't know
about this before?

No.

We missed it.

The security guard
made sure of that.

They must have sealed off
the entrance somehow.

That's where they sleep.

It's almost sunset.

Are you sure
you're still up for this?

I can go it alone.

No.

We're in this
together now.

I'm coming with you.

All right, partners.

click!

Hey.

What are you doing?

I've already put you
in enough danger.

I couldn't live with myself
if anything ever happened
to you.

This isn't fair.

Susan, I know I made
a mess of our marriage.

No matter what you think,
I've always loved you.

Do me a favor.

Just remember that, okay?

Hank, don't do this, please.

You need me.

Yeah, that's right.

I need you to stay alive.

I got myself
into this mess.

I can get myself out.

Here.

If I'mnot out by sundown,
call John.

Get him over here.

Hank, listen.

Whatever you do,
do not remove the stake

once you've killed him

He can come back to life
if you do.

You can only
save yourself.

Killing the leader won't
save the others, only you.

You'll have to kill
all of them

And once you've killed one,
all bets are off.

The others won't hesitate
to kill you.

Right.

[cuff clinks]


[hollow clanking]


[echoing boom]



[bar clangs]

[eerie music]

[distant hissing]




[vampire hisses]

What can I say?

I'm a light sleeper.


I see you've been busy.

Nice shirt.

Yeah, you like?

Yeah.

I really feel

you could accessorize
a little better, though.

I got something that would
go really nicely with that.

Oh, how thoughtful.

I love gifts.


Pity I'm going
to have to kill you.

Uh-oh.

Uh!


[yelling continues]

[demonic whimpering]

[ominous music]

[dramatic choral music]


crunch!
Uh!


Where is he?

I'll see you
in hell.

Tell me where he is,
and I'll remove the stake.


crunch!

Tell me!

Where is he?

He's right behind you.

(The Master)
You're Hank.

Hank; Hank.

You've been
a very bad boy.


Susan?

Isn't he beautiful, Hank?

Susan is part
of the family now.

No.

Kill me

and you'll be
killing her.

That's not true.

If you don't
believe me,

why don't you ask
the expert?

She's under your spell.

She'll say
whatever you want her to say.

[magical chime]

Hank?

Susan, tell
our friend Hank here,

now that you have
been bitten by me,

what happens
ifhe kills me.

I'll die too.

That's not true.

Whoever he has bitten
will die with him

The only one
who will live

is the one
who kills him

No.

Interesting little dilemma,
don't you think?


Much more entertaining
than me just killing you, hmm?

Kill him

How touching.

Now, that is
what I call true love.

Yes, Susan.

Go ahead and kill me,

and Hank and I
will spend

an eternity in hell
together.

Kill him

Or you can just undo
the mess you've done, Hank,

and all of us
can go on living here

as one big,
happy family.

Think of it, Hank.

You and Susan
together forever,

never growing old,

havingpowers beyond
your wildest dreams.

And all you have to do

is just give in

and accept your fate.

Yes, Hank.

Just give in.

[demonic wheezing]

And now he doesn't want
to hurt you,

because you're like
one ofhis offspring.

He created you.

No.

You can't kill me.

Huh?

I'm part of you.

To kill me would be like
killingpart of yourself.

I am growing wary
of this.

Susan, kill him

Susan, do as I say.

Kill him!

Uh!



Come on.

Let's go.

[electricity crackling]


[yelling continues]

How did you know?

What?

How did you know
we'd both survive

if we pulled the trigger
at the same time?

We're not going to survive
if we don't hurry up.

Let's go.

Good-bye, Hank.

Susan!

[rumbling continues]

Susan!



Uh!


Where is she?

What?

Susan.

What did you do
with her body?

I told you already.

Last time I saw her,
she was--

We spent half the night

sifting through the rubble
in that basement.

And that's exactly
what we found--

nothing but rubble.

No, that--that can't be.

I killed them all.

The vampires.

Yes, the vampires.

Just like
in Susan's books.

What kind of fuckinggame
are you playing with me?

No game.

We found these
in your car.

Yeah, I know.

We've been
through this already.

The other day

when Susan and I
were here--

Wait; wait a minute.

When Susan and you
were here?

Yeah,John,
not two days ago.

I haven't seen hide nor hair
of you in over two days,

not since I sent
you undercover,

lookingfor
those missing kids.

Not since you trashed
the break room

seeing Susan
on the television.

Susan reported me
for harassing her.

Susan was reported missing

two days ago--

the same time
you were missing.

Now, don't you find

that an interesting
coincidence, Hank?

John, that's crazy.

Susan was here
with you and me two days ago.

You released me
to her custody.

Released you
to her custody?

Yes.

And I suppose
you left here

and went to a motel
together in Hollywood.

Right.

How did you know?

The desk clerk talked
about a guy

who check in
fitting your description,

and oddly enough, a woman
fitting Susan's description.

And three hours later,
he finds two dead bodies,

her boyfriend,Jake Vincent,
and the PI that worked for him

And apparently they were
murdered in your room

Right.

The vampires

killed them

The only fingerprints
in there were yours

and Susan's.

That's because vampires

don't have
fingerprints.

It says so
in Susan's book.

Isn't that just
a little convenient, Hank?

Blame everything
that's happened on vampires?

Come on;
level with me.

It happens all the time.

Ex-husband goes berserk,
kills the new boyfriend

and the ex.

John, I'm telling you,
the vampires killed them

Oh, I get it.

You're going to use
the insanity defense.

I'mnot insane.

Right.

Get him out ofhere.

[slams desk]

What about my neck?

The bite marks?

(Dr. Blake)
The bite marks
on your neck were gone.

So, in a sense,
you were healed.

Yeah, I guess that's
one way to look at it.

And why do you suppose
that happened?

Your being healed,
that is.

Because I killed
that son of a bitch.

Then if you killed him

how do you think
your wife became a vampire?

Don't you get it?

That's why she went back,

to bring that thing
back to life,

so that he would
bite her again

and she would become
one of them

A vampire?

So your wife wanted
to become a vampire.

What the fuck have I been
talking to you about

for the past hour?

I see.

[electric buzzing]

Okay, well.

This has all
been very interesting.

Hey, Doc?

You think I'm crazy?

I think you loved
your wife very much.

I think your inability
to accept her leaving you

and startinga relationship
with another man

compounded with your

alcohol abuse
and lack of sleep

caused you to suffer
a breakdown of some sort

that manifested itself
into some very--

well, let's just say

some very destructive
and antisocial behavior.

''Antisocial behavior''?


I'm antisocial.

[eerie music]

[door clacks]

[buzzing continues]

Did you miss me, Hank?

Hmm

I love what you've done
with the place.

You're not real.

It really is
wonderful, Hank,

being one of them

You really don't know
what you're missing.

I'mready to sleep now!


Livingforever--

Somebody!

Never growing old.

You're not real.

You going to tell me
that wasn't real?

But Captain Billings--

Didn't remember
anything?

No one did.

Naturally.

The Master's powers
are far more incredible

than I could have
ever guessed.

You removed his arrow
to bring him back, didn't you?

You were just
usingme to get to him

You didn't care
about me.

You just wanted
to become one of them

You really don't get it,
do you, Hank?

Look at me.

I can do
whatever I want.

I'm going
to live forever.

It's everything
I ever dreamed about.

I loved you.

I would have done
anythingfor you.

Yes, you always were

the incurable romantic,
weren't you?


That's why
I'mhere, Hank,

because you love me.

Because you're
stubborn and obsessive.

And I knew if you
ever got out ofhere,

you'd never give up
until you found me again.

[electric crackling]



[demonic groaning]

How's that
for romantic?

crunch!



Consider this
a divorce.


I think we may have
a breakthrough.

He's finally come to terms
with the breakup.

He may now even be able to put
the obsession with his wife

behind him altogether.

Will he tell us
where the body is?

That's the question.

Perhaps.

He's going to need sedating
after such a cathartic episode.

Did you see that?

Administer two CCs
ofhexachloride.

Wait a second.

I told you
she would come.

I want to talk
to him first.

[electric flicker]

[door clicks]

Hi, Hank.

Did you see that?

She came for me,John,

just like I knew
she would.

What do you think?

Is it time?

What?

To tell me
where the body is.

She's right over there,

where the...

But you were
watching, right?

From the other room?

You saw it all

on the video camera.

Huh.

Oh, of course.

You couldn't
see her,

because vampires
can't be photographed.

John--hey, wait;
no,John.

John--

Sooner or later, Hank;

sooner or later.

Does this
look familiar?

No.

Did he have
any visitors?

Civilians?

No.

Only you and me.

Maybe it's one
of the nurses'.

There are no
female nurses

on this floor.

No?
