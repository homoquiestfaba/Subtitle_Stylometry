<i>[male narrator]</i>
<i>I know.</i>

<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

<i>Not the first to use it.</i>

<i>But with a visual like this,</i>

<i>what does
it matter?</i>

<i>So much can be drawn.</i>

<i>Endless numbers</i>
<i>in constant motion,</i>

<i>yet rooted in the ground.</i>

It would be easy to point out
how so many turn the same way

<i>but never quite together.</i>

<i>And then...</i>

<i>there is my favorite.</i>

<i>There are those who</i>
<i>could use poetic imagery</i>

<i>to comment on tilting</i>
<i>at these modern windmills.</i>

<i>Me? I just like</i>
<i>the way they look.</i>

[car door closes]
[engine starts]

<i>In case you were wondering,</i>

<i>these fellas ain't</i>
<i>taking me on a picnic.</i>

<i>No. They're getting me ready</i>
<i>for the Rajah,</i>

<i>a man who's spent the better part
of the decade trying to find me.</i>

<i>Well, looks like he found me.</i>

<i>So they're going to hurt me,</i>

<i>to reintroduce me</i>
<i>to Lady Pain,</i>

<i>almost to the point of dying.</i>

<i>Long lost...</i>

<i>but not quite.</i>

[punching]
[groaning]

<i>Say, maybe they'll get tired</i>
<i>of beating me after a while.</i>

<i>Well, it's not a perfect plan,</i>

<i>but it'll have to do...</i>
<i>for now.</i>

[punching continues]

Enough.

[punching continues]

Enough!

The sun's taking a powder.

We need to put the icing on our
little pal's welcome-home cake.

Wait.

He said
the elevator's too slow.

He said
take the stairs.

<i>The suave devil</i>
<i>you see here is Walter.</i>

His boys just gave me a beating that'll
have them waking up sore in the morning.

<i>I should be on death's door.</i>

<i>Walter thinks so.</i>

And you probably think so, too.

<i>But I have damn good reason</i>
<i>to keep living.</i>

<i>The only one</i>
<i>that ever mattered.</i>

<i>Her.</i>


<i>I suppose this is</i>
<i>where I wake up again.</i>

[faucet dripping]

<i>Ooh. That smarts.</i>

<i>Blade must have been German.</i>

<i>Ahh...</i>

<i>Zeldingun steel.</i>


<i>The tongue never lies.</i>


<i>That's good.</i>

<i>Gonna have to remember</i>
<i>that one.</i>

<i>Gasoline.</i>

<i>Nose must be really messed up</i>
<i>to not smell that.</i>

<i>Mmm...</i>

<i>Much better.</i>

<i>But whose blood is this?</i>

<i>Mine... or Walter's?</i>

Doesn't really taste like mine.

<i>But then again...</i>

<i>some of it could be</i>
<i>from Walter's pals.</i>

It's been 10 years since I left
this godforsaken place,

<i>and I need to think.</i>

<i>But I'm so very tired</i>
<i>of thinking.</i>

<i>Maybe it's best</i>
<i>to just sleep on it.</i>

<i>The only problem is...</i>

<i>when I sleep, I remember.</i>

<i>And nothing hurts</i>
<i>quite like that.</i>

<i>When I was a child,</i>

<i>the fairy tale</i>
<i>was a wondrous thing,</i>

<i>full of magic and hope.</i>

<i>But when you grow older,</i>

<i>fairy tales are no longer</i>
<i>so wonderful.</i>

<i>They represent foolish dreams,</i>

<i>the unreachable.</i>

<i>Like many fairy tales,</i>
<i>our story begins with a king,</i>

<i>a man named Nikolai.</i>

<i>There was a girl Nikolai loved</i>
<i>more than life itself:</i>

<i>Tatiana.</i>

<i>But Nikolai knew there was a darkness
inside that would corrupt her,</i>

<i>so he had to leave Tatiana</i>
<i>and his heart behind.</i>

<i>We would not know how</i>
<i>Nikolai became king.</i>

<i>We just know he was a king.</i>

<i>A ruthless king</i>

<i>with his best friend,</i>
<i>the Maharajah, by his side.</i>

<i>The Maharajah had a son he
treasured more than anything,</i>

<i>The Rajah.</i>

<i>And there was also Sergei,</i>
<i>Nikolai's willful brother.</i>

<i>Reckless and charming,</i>

<i>Sergei had desire</i>
<i>and passion aplenty</i>

<i>and a daughter he loved</i>
<i>so very dearly:</i>

<i>Porphyria.</i>

<i>My beautiful princess.</i>

<i>But Sergei also had</i>
<i>envy for his brother,</i>

<i>for he had no kingdom.</i>

<i>Eventually, this pushed</i>
<i>Nikolai too far.</i>

You will leave, Sergei.

How dare you.

Breathing or not,
you will leave.

This I will not forgive.

<i>A year later...</i>

Brother!

<i>Sergei returned.</i>

Of course you remember
Tatiana.

<i>Tatiana could not realize</i>
<i>the storm she was entering.</i>

<i>Of course, Nikolai had</i>
<i>never stopped loving her.</i>

<i>She grew troubled.</i>

It's never easy loving one man,
let alone two brothers.

<i>She went to the Maharaja</i>
<i>for advice.</i>

<i>Crazed by her emotions,</i>

<i>Tatiana turned to medicines</i>
<i>the Maharaja gave her,</i>

<i>medicines meant to relax.</i>

<i>But instead,</i>
<i>they disoriented her,</i>

<i>allowing other</i>
<i>unscrupulous men</i>

<i>to take advantage</i>
<i>of her confusion.</i>

<i>One day, Tatiana discovered</i>
<i>she was pregnant.</i>

It could be yours.

It could be Sergei's.
It could be another's.

Another's?

Is it mine?

I don't know.

I'm sorry.


<i>When Tatiana, my mother,</i>

<i>gave birth to a miserable</i>
<i>wretch of a baby boy,</i>

<i>she truly did not know</i>
<i>who the father was.</i>

<i>The strain began</i>
<i>to drive her mad.</i>

<i>I can't say it did wonders</i>
<i>for me... either.</i>

I want you to remember...

no matter what happens,

I will always...

always love you.

But, Mommy,

I love you.

<i>But that was not enough</i>
<i>to stop her</i>

<i>from eventually</i>
<i>making a choice...</i>

<i>to leave this place...</i>

<i>and all the suffering</i>

<i>and me... behind.</i>

[horn honks]


<i>Great.</i>

<i>Forgot about Vassily.</i>

<i>My life in a nutshell.</i>

<i>Just once...</i>

<i>Just once I'd like to keep</i>
<i>the perfect sleep.</i>

<i>You know the one</i>
<i>I'm talking about.</i>

<i>You fall asleep on a train</i>
<i>or someone's couch</i>

<i>or in a hospital...</i>

<i>and it's perfect.</i>

<i>The ecstasy of the unlikely.</i>

<i>And then some bastard</i>
<i>wakes you up,</i>

<i>and you can't get it back</i>
<i>no matter how hard you try.</i>

<i>You never knew it was perfect</i>
<i>until you lost it.</i>

<i>And all you have left is that sick,
burning desire to get it back.</i>

<i>The perfect sleep.</i>

<i>Speaking of which,</i>

<i>you probably think this</i>
<i>is one of those stories,</i>

<i>a study of the shadows,</i>

<i>dark and dirty</i>
<i>and utterly amoral.</i>

<i>Say, nice shot.</i>

<i>Sorry if it seems</i>
<i>kind of cliche,</i>

<i>but the French</i>
<i>dig this kind of visual,</i>

<i>and I dig the French.</i>

Walter!
You filthy whore!

What the hell's
taking you so damn long?

You ready to light
this candle or not?

Close enough.


Hello, Vassily.

You shouldn't have
come back.

You and your boys
brought me back.

He brought me back.

Yes, he did,
but something tells me...

you've been asking
to be back, hmm?

Didn't you ever hear the nursery rhyme
about the little boy with the big mouth...

and a gun in his chest
and a bullet for every orifice?

Forgive me.

I'm not too good
with the classics.

Maybe you were waiting for that
beautiful girl with the dark hair, huh?

Tread lightly, Vassily.

The Rajah's
going to kill you,

and then I hope I'll be here
for his next trick...

when he kills her.

<i>I know so many ways</i>
<i>to kill this guy,</i>

<i>some of them painless.</i>

<i>Unfortunately for him...</i>

[thuds]
[Vassily screams]

Oops.

You never should have
mentioned her.

<i>Some of you clever-types might</i>
<i>think this is the kinda story</i>

<i>where it all kinda</i>
<i>makes sense in the end.</i>

[explosion]
[glass shatters]

<i>Wrong.</i>

<i>When Nikolai found</i>
<i>his beloved Tatiana,</i>

<i>he was overcome by</i>
<i>the darkness inside him.</i>

<i>Nikolai lost</i>
<i>the love of his life</i>

<i>and his best friend</i>
<i>and brother.</i>

<i>Porphyria would never</i>
<i>see her father again.</i>

Why did he leave me?

<i>I would never see my mother.</i>

<i>Ours was a bond</i>
<i>forged by grief.</i>

<i>Like a good uncle, Nikolai</i>
<i>took the three orphans in,</i>

<i>and in his way, grew to love</i>
<i>this boy who was not his own,</i>

<i>I think.</i>

<i>I was treated differently</i>
<i>because of who I was</i>

<i>and who I could be.</i>

<i>The Rajah has always blamed me</i>
<i>for the death of his father.</i>

<i>As a boy, he worshipped</i>
<i>the Maharajah.</i>


<i>And that made it</i>
<i>so very hard to understand</i>

<i>why a man he could not recognize
would kill the Maharajah,</i>

<i>especially for who watched</i>
<i>his father bleed to death.</i>

<i>Fortunately, there were</i>
<i>those who cared for me,</i>

<i>including men I called</i>
<i>my cousins.</i>

<i>Cousin Rogozhin,</i>
<i>the best man.</i>

<i>He taught me about heart</i>
<i>and nobility.</i>

<i>The other, Ganya,</i>

was a different kind of mentor.

<i>A man named Ivan was</i>
<i>a friend to me as well.</i>

You must play for years
before you even realize

what a truly clumsy player
you are.

Don't you think, my dear?

<i>Ivan also cared for Porphyria.</i>

<i>My princess.</i>

<i>I loved her.</i>

<i>I lived for her.</i>

<i>I always shall.</i>

We have a problem.

And that is?

As expected, the Rajah
has made his next big move,

and it was a stupid one.

For some idiotic reason, he had his
men track down your avenging angel.

But instead of
killing him then and there,

they brought him back so the
Rajah could kill him this time.

And he wasn't too successful.

You'll hate me
for saying this, but...

might be a pity he survived.

The Rajah would have made
his point, had his revenge.

We could negotiate.

Now with him back, a catastrophic
situation only gets worse.

Worse?

No.

I do believe his return
signals a change for the better.

My dear Porphyria...

must you always take things
with a grain of sugar?

With what the Rajah did to us,
our hands are completely tied.

One man, even this man,
won't change that.

He already has, Ivan.

We'll see.

Area's clear.

Fire's under control.

Any signs of him?

A few.

And what of my other men?

Luckily all dead from bullet
wounds before the campfire started.

Except for poor Vassily.

He didn't waste any time except
on poor well-done Vassily.

An unloaded gun in one hand

and a rather disturbing grimace
on what was left of his face.

Seems he got a bit emotional
with Vassily.

How disappointing.

You're making a mistake if you
think this is going to be cute.

He studied the Good Book.

He's learned a few lessons from
the angry Old Testament god.

This is a man who's
put away childish things.

You should've killed him
when you had the chance.

<i>We grew up...</i>

<i>too quickly.</i>

<i>One fateful day,</i>

<i>we learned some fairy tales</i>
<i>were written in blood.</i>

Porphyria, there is
something I must tell you.

I was there when
Nikolai killed your father.

<i>This is the world</i>
<i>we were born into.</i>

<i>Nothing would ever</i>
<i>be the same again.</i>

<i>He left Nikolai's house</i>
<i>with Ganya,</i>

<i>never to return.</i>

<i>Nobody understood my choice.</i>

<i>Rogozhin felt he had</i>
<i>to stay with Nikolai.</i>

<i>He was my hero.</i>

<i>He still is.</i>

<i>Like a father,</i>
<i>Nikolai had raised me.</i>

<i>And now he would</i>
<i>never forgive me.</i>

I hate
to tell you this...

<i>Never one to sit back,</i>

<i>Nikolai told the Rajah</i>
<i>Sergei killed his father</i>

<i>with Ganya's help.</i>

<i>Insane with anger,</i>
<i>the Rajah condemned us all.</i>


<i>The Rajah has always bee consumed with
the idea his father would never have died</i>

<i>if I never existed.</i>

<i>He may be right.</i>

<i>My relationship</i>
<i>with Porphyria changed</i>

<i>when we were infected</i>
<i>with awareness.</i>

<i>There is no greater loss</i>
<i>than innocence.</i>

<i>I dedicated myself to ensuring</i>
<i>nobody threatened her.</i>

<i>Then one day...</i>

Let there be peace
between us, Porphyria.

<i>...my protection of her</i>
<i>was no longer necessary.</i>

<i>Oh, I almost forgot.</i>

<i>Ivan also left Porphyria.</i>

<i>And so...</i>

<i>I was no longer necessary.</i>

<i>You would think this is the first
time I've seen her in 10 years.</i>

<i>Not true.</i>

<i>I see her every day.</i>

<i>Every time I close my eyes.</i>

<i>You see, in my own way,</i>

<i>I love this woman</i>
<i>they call Porphyria</i>

<i>more than words or images</i>
<i>could ever suggest.</i>

<i>As much as I love her,</i>
<i>and I truly do love her,</i>

<i>I hate myself even more.</i>

Gregor, please.

Not the face.

As much as I would like
to take the credit,

that's not all my work.

Walter's boys
set the table for you.

And you relieved Walter and the
boys of the burden of breathing.

Something like that.

So, 10 years later,
the Tokyo drifter returns.

I thought you would've
come back sooner.

You know how it is.

Yeah, I know.

Come on. There are those
who've been waiting to see you.

You can walk, right?
Sure.

Special delivery.
Where should I put him?

Here.

Where did you
find him?

Outside that window.

How did he pass
your security?

Ivan, get the first-aid kit.

You've finally
come back to me.

<i>And after seeing me</i>
<i>somewhat regularly,</i>

<i>a wind generator repairman</i>
<i>once asked...</i>

What particular narcotic did
your mother ingest while pregnant

to inspire you
to keep coming out here?

Don't know.

What brought you here?

My health.

Asthma?
Nah.

My wallet and my past
ain't healthy.

Desert's cheap and hides
skeletons rather well.

<i>He couldn't see</i>
<i>why I kept returning.</i>

You must be one of those...

"find myself through solitude and
adversity in the wilderness" types.

Well, that's fuckin' great.

But the only thing you're gonna
find yourself here, Diogenes,

is a mean case of heatstroke
and couple of burnt lungs.

The only thing left
is to kill yourself

to get out of this
sick, sick heat.

Maybe that's why
I come out here.

Welcome home.

Your legend has grown
quite a bit in your absence.

You know that the younger men
refer to you as the Mad Monk?

I believe it
to be an apt choice.

Not so much because of your stubborn
resistance to death and injuries,

but because of the unusual, painful methods
you have chosen to express your worship.

I see at least two wounds
need stitches.

You're losing
a lot of blood.

I've heard that's
a rather pleasant way to die.

Really?

What dead person
told you that?

I'll call our doctor.

No.

I'll rest now.

The bandages don't help,
I'll use duct tape.

You are so ridiculous,
and you need to sleep.

But I don't even want
to let you do that.

Do you need me
to go to work now?

No, of course not.

I'm worried about
your head injuries.

God has never been
that kind to me.

You would like that,
wouldn't you?

Slipping away in your sleep,
beating me to the punch?

Of killing you
for driving me so insane.

You haven't changed a bit.

Nothing's changed.

<i>Please...</i>

<i>don't.</i>

Enough.
Ivan Fyodo, enough!

Do you know what we gain
if he gets to the Rajah?

I'm talking about not standing
in the way of the inevitable.

Can you not see we are literally
a half-second from doom?

Literally, no.
There's another way.

The way of the idiot?

We'll all be buried
if we don't play this right.

I have nothing against him.
I know what he can do.

But we cannot
make a mistake.

The Rajah has
planned this for ages.

And I will not lose
my daughter!

<i>Perhaps I forgot to tell you.</i>

<i>In time, Ivan and Porphyria were blessed
with their own princess, Nadya.</i>

<i>While Nikolai lives in</i>
<i>the past, his empire decays.</i>

<i>Distracted, he lets another</i>
<i>run his kingdom.</i>

<i>A man still bent on revenge.</i>

[radio playing]
# ...way to Tipperary #

# To the sweet-- #

[crack]
[groans]

[radio playing]

Mommy?

Not quite.

<i>Doesn't get much lower</i>
<i>than kidnapping a child.</i>

<i>But the Rajah wouldn't go this far if there wasn't
something else he wanted so very badly:</i>

<i>The one that got away.</i>

<i>For a long time, the Rajah's</i>
<i>been looking to find me,</i>

<i>looking to kill me.</i>

<i>And because of all</i>
<i>that has happened,</i>

<i>I have done what I swore</i>
<i>that I would never do:</i>

<i>Go home.</i>

You have come
about the lost one.

The one so intimate
with death,

but never with dying.

Father, I had to find him.

And...
in all that we do, I...

I wonder if you are right.

Yet, I feel that--
My son...

you know how often
I had read Othello.

Yet each and every time
I read it,

I hope and yearn
and even believe

that she, Desdemona,

might just live this time.

If only...

If only...

Is there no way to fight it?
One thing I have learned:

You cannot feel
other than how you feel,

no matter how much
you long for different,

better emotions.

We are but slaves
to ourselves

and the blood
that feeds us.

Porphyria, you pit him against the
Rajah, and it will be death of us all.

Consider what they
have stolen from me.

From us.

He kidnapped my Nadya.

When do we fight back?

Are you as mad
and suicidal as he is?

His return here
has sealed his fate.

<i>- Hopefully.</i>
<i>-</i> But only his.

I refuse to believe that.

Well, then maybe it's time
you protected him from himself.

Give me that.

Send him away, please.

Before the inevitable happens.

<i>I've waited too long.</i>

<i>Like a famous man</i>
<i>once told me,</i>

<i>"Less talk, more action."</i>

So, you gonna read me
my rights, Officer?

Sure.

You have the right to remove
your right strap first.

Slowly.

Are we safe at this speed?

Not for long.

Now the rest.

[phone ringing]

Ah, hell.

This won't take long.

If you move an inch, baby,
I'll kill ya.


This is Pavlovitch.
This better be good.

Uh--

Holy Jeff Markham in tights.
You're alive after all.

I got your letter.

Just didn't think you were
crazy enough to return,

but then I remembered
who I was dealing with.

Look, I got your plans,
I got your information,

got your little murder toys.

Just give me a few.
I'm in the midst of, uh...

upholding the law.

<i># Oh, baby #</i>

<i># She can't help it</i>
<i>She was born to be wicked #</i>

Yeah.

<i># Baby, oh, baby #</i>

<i># She can't help it</i>
<i>She was born to be wicked #</i>

<i># She can't help it</i>
<i>She was born #</i>


You move well for a big man.


But nobody moves like me.


Every now and then,
I put on a jacket

and some trousers
I haven't worn in a while,

and every now and then, inside
a pocket, I find a 10-spot.

Maybe a 20
if I'm really lucky.

There's nothing quite like that
feeling of a pleasant little surprise.

You? You're not like that.

Why would you come back?

I didn't come back.

They brought me back.

Probably because your pal
Ivan-- or "Ee-van"--

maneuvered them into it.

You don't look like
any chess piece I know.

Certainly not a pawn.

No. I'm just
unfinished business.

Since you're still alive, that
means the Rajah must be slipping.

Or else you've been
planning this all along.

Sitting out
wherever you were.

Waiting, thinking.

Clickety clickety click.


You know what I don't like
about you?

Aside from the fact that I can
never get a word in edgewise?

Every now and then I like to thing that
this is a random world with no consequences,

no hand of fate,

and if a beam falls
on my head right now,

it's just be a matter
of time and circumstance.

Whenever I look at you,

I start to think
that might not be the case.

You know what that means?

No.

Means we're all
fucked, man.

Thanks for the assist.

The old rules apply.

Keep things quiet...

and in-house...

or I'll crush you.

All I want from you
is to bring him to us,

and everything will
go back to the way it was.

You and I know
that's not true.

I know the Rajah's methods.

The poison's already
in my bloodstream.

No. But even if it was,

there are many ways to die,
my friend.

You know his methods
aren't the nicest ones.

So why don't you make it easy
on all of us and bring him here?

Never.

You want me to bring in
the little girl

and cut off pieces of her
in front of you?

Keller.

He'll be
on the move now.

No time for talking.

Any last words?

Yeah.

There's a special providence
when you follow a sparrow.

And this sparrow will
see you both in hell.


[stab]
[screams]

<i>Observation and anticipation.</i>

<i>Lessons I learned long ago.</i>

<i>But it's easy for me.</i>

<i>If you don't like</i>
<i>to focus on yourself,</i>

<i>a rare quality,</i>

<i>you might listen to others.</i>

<i>An even rarer quality,</i>

<i>if you observe</i>
<i>and anticipate,</i>

<i>you might just get</i>
<i>something accomplished.</i>

<i>To these eyes,</i>
<i>a boring scene.</i>

<i>A well-heeled private clinic</i>
<i>hidden in the country,</i>

<i>seemingly devoid of life.</i>

<i>But through these eyes,</i>

<i>the whole world comes alive.</i>

<i>And there he is:</i>

<i>the Rajah's prized possession,</i>
<i>Captain Keller.</i>

<i>He's killed more people</i>
<i>than you've met.</i>

<i>A good man to avoid.</i>

<i>Oops.</i>

<i>So much for avoiding him.</i>

I trust you're unarmed.

I never enter with a gun.

I've heard that about you.

The Monk.

The Mad Monk.

I've been waiting a long time
for this moment.

Shall we begin?


<i>He's so much more</i>
<i>skilled than me</i>

<i>and very quick.</i>

<i>But how's his power?</i>

<i>Power's quite good.</i>

<i>In this case,</i>
<i>observation and anticipation</i>

<i>don't appear to have</i>
<i>done me much good.</i>

<i>I could have used rest.</i>


<i>Or training.</i>

<i>A mistake, I'll grant you.</i>

<i>I have some other techniques,</i>

but they don't seem to be
helping me as much as I'd like.

<i>But there's one quality that always
sees me through this kind of thing.</i>

No matter how many times I seem
to try and get myself killed...

like Winston Churchill told me,

I never, never, never, never...

<i>in nothing, great or small,</i>
<i>large or petty,</i>

<i>never give in.</i>


<i>All right.</i>

<i>So maybe anticipation wasn't</i>
<i>a total failure after all.</i>

For God's sakes,
what is this?


This isn't your M.O.

You work alone.

Except on special occasions.

Captain Keller,
meet Dr. Sebastian,

an old acquaintance.

Hello.

As we near the half minute mark,
I'll limit my usual, drawn-out anatomy lesson.

The strange sensation
you now experience

comes from the laceration
of your femoral artery.

If it were a partial tear,

and you had access to
qualified medical personnel,

you might have a chance.

But I'm afraid my incision has
seen to a complete severing.

Funny, the eccentricities
of human existence.

Despite years
of martial artistry

and a triathlete's endurance,

one little slice defies
this lifetime of training.

The importance of
this avenue of blood flow

robs you of your formidable
strength each passing second.

Even now you are but a mere
infant, mewling and bleeding,

in your nurse's arms,
crawling to oblivion.

You won't find
what you've come for.

The Rajah will get you.

Shh.

As I've opened the floodgates
of your very mortality,

may I suggest you quickly
choose one subject to dwell on

instead of many?

I certainly wouldn't recommend
you worry about work at this point.

Already, you're
experiencing the onset.

The clamminess.

The narrowing.

The finality of your life
approaches.

Seize that which
you cherish most

and hold onto it.

Good night, sweet prince.

Nice of you to share
this procedure with me.

I hope you won't think me
the blushing virgin

if I reveal that I have been
anxiously awaiting this day.

Shall we?

That Keller
was quite skilled.

I almost felt like watching to see
if even you could have outlasted him.

It might have been close.

Indeed.

May I suggest you consider
working on your defense a bit?

You concentrate entirely
too much on attack.

Your coat, sir.

And your card.

Oh, dear.

Let's straighten up
that collar.

It's too bad about the blood,
but it is a clinic.

There. That's better.

Everything is set.
I shall see you shortly.

<i>As talented as Sebastian is,</i>

<i>I have to say I hesitated</i>
<i>to ask for his help.</i>

[whistling]
Hey! How you been, Doc?

Couldn't be better,
Alberto.

Couldn't be better.

<i>Maybe it's just because,</i>
<i>unlike me,</i>

he enjoys what he does so much.

<i>Despite what you might think,</i>

<i>I have never taken joy</i>
<i>in killing.</i>

In fact, I hate what I do.
I just happen to be good at it.

Head's up.
We got company.

What are you doing
down here, sir?

Lung therapy.

[stab]
[groans]


The pneumothorax is most
unpleasant, isn't it?


My scalpels punctured
one of each of your lungs.

Even now, your lung collapses.

Hardly fatal,
but, oh, so painful.

Yet, I know
what you're thinking.

What if both lungs
are pierced?

I can assure you

the resulting death takes
far longer than it should

under the watchful eye
of a merciful God.

But as with all things,

our very biological
structure promise us

that if it be now,
'tis not to come.

If it be not to come,
it will be now.

If it be not now,
yet it will come.

Good sirs,

the readiness is all.

[stabs]
[groans]

<i>Sebastian will see</i>
<i>to the generator in three...</i>

Eyes!
<i>- two...</i>

<i>one.</i>

<i>I can handle the rest.</i>

She looks so very much
like her mother.

Don't you think?

She looks like you, too.

"Dr. Myshkin"?

No.

She does not.

It's been such a long time
since we've seen each other.

So very long.


There was a time we greeted
each other differently.

There was a time
we greeted each other.

Has Nikolai been
treating you well?

Up till now.

I'm sorry
it's come to this.

I will not follow.

You be gentle with her.

Tell her mother
I allowed this peaceably.

Don't hurt
any more of my men...

or I will find you.

Understood.

Good-bye, cousin.

Thank you.

<i>Since I was a boy,</i>
<i>he took care of me.</i>

<i>And this is how I repay him.</i>

<i>I hate myself.</i>

Forgive me,
cousin.

North quad is clear.

Shh. As you go to sleep,

let me explain the effects of
strangulation on your laryngeal muscles.

Stay right there!


Jugular, carotid, jugular.

Carotid, jugular.

Sebastian!

No more. Please.

Do you only kill now
in her name?

No.

Only if necessary.

Or when it's deserved.
Deserved?

Why, if that were the case,
comrade,

you could never stop to rest.

Still, I must admit,

you disappoint me.

How fitting.

Not a day in my life passes
that I don't disappoint myself.

Ah, there's the rub.

Still, despite
certain fixations,

I never thought you'd succumb to the
notion of the preciousness of life.

Does it seems so ludicrous
when you look upon her?

She is magnificent.

As beautiful
as she is sweet.

And yet, an organism
not so different

from yonder snail that streaks
across the outer wall.

Do the snail's parents want nothing
but the best for their child?

Do they grieve at the child's
passing if it goes before them?

No, my friend.

Not even such an angelic face
would have me believe.

Yes, I know.

I must go.
Thank you, old friend.

Anytime, tovarich.

I await your next call.

[guard groans]

Ah!

Ivan!

Ivan!

Coming!

We need to talk.

Nadya!
When did she leave?

Doctor, quickly!
Nadya's back!

Give her to me.
I'll take care of her.

Ivan, this is
what I'm here for.

I need to make sure
she's all right.

Please hurry.

Come on, Nadya.

When?

I don't know.
I thought she was with you.

No.

He knew.

<i>It seems I'm not</i>
<i>as clever as I thought</i>

<i>Nikolai knew</i>
<i>I would go for Nadya.</i>

<i>He always told me to have</i>
<i>a contingency plan.</i>

Hello, my niece.

You've lost the right
to call me that

the day you killed
my father.

That, like so much else,
was an unfortunate necessity.

How can you say that?

You forget that Sergei
brought her here to spite me.

And that is nothing
compared to the fact

that he abandoned her just
like he abandoned your mother.

He was your brother,
Nikolai

You cannot
understand.

Tatiana was an angel,
utterly pure,

and Sergei brought her
into my world.

And she--

love of my life--

killed herself...

because of Sergei.

That was unforgivable.

Then you should have
killed yourself,

and none of this
would have happened.

I have thought about it
once or twice.

If I had,

Porphyria's lover
might not exist,

and I don't mean Ivan.

How dare you.


Yes.

How dare I.

Meanwhile, in spite
of all my efforts,

the Rajah will not stop
until he has his vengeance.

Will you tell him the truth?

That you killed his father.

Or just kill the Rajah?

Don't both of us know
that I cannot do that?

It pains me
to tell you this.

The Rajah has him.

He went to the clinic to try
and rescue your beautiful Nadya,

and together
they very nearly escaped.

I don't--
I don't believe you.

I have managed to hold
the Rajah at bay, Porphyria.

But now I need your help
to save <i>him.</i>

Why would you do that?

You think that
I who raised him

wish to see him suffer?

You took Nadya.
I don't trust you.

Perhaps you shouldn't.

[speaking Russian]

You bastard.

You will thank me,
eventually.

When all this
is brought to an end

and your daughter
is returned to you,

the truce is restored,

you can live in peace.

And as for my wayward
prodigal son,

God have mercy upon him.

He will die in peace
so all this can happen.

He's not your son.

Perhaps not, but trust me
when I tell you this.

I will put an end
to his suffering.

That much he will know.

I swear.

<i>The center of the city is the
downtown metropolis portion.</i>

[line ringing]
<i>To me, the center of the city</i>

<i>is that point which allows you
to get you where you need to be</i>

<i>- as quickly as possible.</i>
<i>-</i> [phone picked up]

<i>- Yes?</i>
<i>- Hello, Ivan.</i>

<i>Nice night for a drive,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

If you ever want to see
Porphyria alive again,

be at the bunkers
in two hours...

<i>with him. Only one car</i>
<i>will be allowed in.</i>

<i>[Ivan on phone] For God's sake, be reasonable.
I can't get there that fast.</i>

<i>All right. You have</i>
<i>two hours and one minute.</i>

<i>[narrator]</i>
<i>The bunkers.</i>

<i>The Rajah couldn't resist.</i>

<i>I see his point.</i>

<i>His father died here.</i>

<i>We were trained here.</i>

<i>Differences were always</i>
<i>settled here.</i>

<i>And now the blood spilled on this
concrete must be getting lonely.</i>

<i>The Rajah already has</i>
<i>his men in place.</i>

<i>He can arrive shortly</i>
<i>with everything planned.</i>

<i>Ready for Ivan and me</i>
<i>to arrive...</i>

<i>an hour from now.</i>


<i>The renowned samurai</i>
<i>Miyamoto Musashi</i>

<i>lived in Japan</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

<i>An artist and philosopher,</i>

<i>he was ridiculously</i>
<i>talented with the sword</i>

<i>and just as formidable</i>
<i>strategically.</i>

<i>Sometimes, Musashi</i>
<i>arrived late to a fight</i>

<i>because it made</i>
<i>his opponent anxious.</i>

<i>And sometimes...</i>

<i>sometimes Musashi</i>
<i>arrived early.</i>

[silenced gunshots]

<i>To be honest,</i>

<i>I'm torn as to how I really</i>
<i>feel about night vision.</i>

<i>Practical, yes,</i>

<i>but it tends to make this kind</i>
<i>of thing into a video game.</i>

<i>Taking somebody's life</i>
<i>should not be like this.</i>

<i>Easy. Distant.</i>

<i>Almost fun.</i>

[car doors closing]

<i>They have her covered.</i>

<i>I can't kill them all in time.</i>

What is it?
It's nothing.

I don't know.
Look out.

<i>- Good thing I won't need to.</i>
<i>-</i> [silenced gunshots]

<i>I don't think they know</i>
<i>who they're dealing with.</i>

Porphyria, please.
Do not kill him.

None of my actions
are his fault.

He's opposed me
in all of this.

My time is done here.
See you later, my boy.

Lovely lady...

I've waited for you
my whole life.

<i>[Young Porphyria]</i>
<i>Daddy, where's mommy?</i>


<i>[narrator]</i>
<i>She is magnificent.</i>

<i>But this is no longer</i>
<i>her fight.</i>


<i>For what he has done</i>
<i>this night,</i>

<i>I could have</i>
<i>killed him already.</i>

<i>But the Rajah's earned</i>
<i>the right to see my face</i>

<i>at the time of reckoning.</i>

Go.

No.

Please.
No.

You must leave now.

Take their car.
Call Ivan.

He's already on his way.

I share as much history
with him as you do.

I deserve vengeance
as much as you.

Perhaps even more so.
I'm not leaving.

Perhaps you will still
get that chance.

But this is no longer
your concern.

There's a little angel
waiting for you.

She's unharmed
and oh so beautiful.

Please go to her.

Please.

<i>Was it my father who killed</i>
<i>the Rajah's father?</i>

<i>The Rajah killed</i>
<i>my cousin Ganya.</i>

<i>Who's to say more of his
ancestors did not kill more of mine?</i>

<i>How must this all look</i>
<i>from his point of view?</i>

us that we must now do this?

What have we become?

<i>So fast.</i>

<i>I could die here.</i>
<i>Maybe I should die here.</i>

<i>Pithing, the art of severing</i>
<i>the spinal cord at the neck.</i>

<i>It's the Rajah's specialty.</i>

How does it feel to die
at my hands...

as you kiss life goodbye,
knowing she will soon follow?

Tell me.

How does it feel?

<i>Or it was.</i>

<i>I will show my true form.</i>

<i>I will baptize myself</i>
<i>with hate.</i>

I wanted you
to taste victory,

to think that you
would go unpunished.

I wanted you
to consider tomorrow

as you fight for breath
that will not come.

I want you to think of life
and all that you cherish

and to ache with every fiber of
your being for what you cannot have!


I want you to do
what I do every day.

I want you to suffer.

<i>I believe</i>
<i>I already told you.</i>

<i>Anticipation is</i>
<i>one of my specialties.</i>

<i>If brain hypoxia sets in,</i>
<i>he'll die,</i>

<i>and I just can't</i>
<i>let that happen.</i>

<i>Not to him.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>That would be too easy.</i>

<i>I'll revive him.</i>

<i>But first,</i>
<i>a little surgery.</i>

Never again
will you touch her.

Never will you hurt her.

You shall be like me,
my brother.

A prisoner
of your own flesh.

<i>Special delivery, Nikolai.</i>

<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

Nadya!

Nadya! Nadya!

Oh, my baby!

I've been expecting you,
my pale Tetsuya.


I can see that.

Oh, this?

Just my usual
narcotic nightcap.


There.


I'm cured.

Let's get a look at you.

Well...

Added a few to
the tapestry of pain, I see.

So what's your story,
genius?

Come back into town
on your big white horse,

kill a bunch of killers

so you can save a beautiful little
girl and her beautiful little mother

that you can never really
tell how you feel?

Interesting.

Your tooth?

Hmm.

Where was I?

Still trying to preserve some
fantasy of purpose and nobility

in a world that has none?


Got a few ribs
broken?

Something like that.

So what do you need?

I need to finish
my work tonight.

That's a good one.

And if I thought you were
a total fucking idiot,

I'd think you were actually talking
about going to Nikolai's place.

Let me get
my painkillers, idiot.

I'm going to keep you as lucid
and functional as possible.

You'll be in intense
and debilitating pain,

which I imagine will come as
somewhat of a relief for you.

Sunday afternoon stuff.

You know, you did the world
a great disservice by,

well, whatever the hell it
was you did to the Rajah.

He had such a bright
medical future.

It's funny how things
conspire to derail a life,

to ensure that
what was meant to be...



never happens.


Yeah, funny.

Now, I would love to get into
your medical history one day.

What do you know
about your father?

I know I never knew
who my father is...

or was...

out of the men
that he could be.

Well, that clears that up.

But I have my own theories
on that end.

And the great wildcard,
Mommy Dearest?

Long story.

Yeah, I know.

My mother was
very generous.

She passed on a certain
predilection for addiction

that not even a lifetime of
medical education has overcome.


Score one for heredity.

Is that was this is?

Resigned finality?

Bowing to the hand of fate?

Just remember the story
of Flitcraft, my friend.

He vanished and left his old
life behind for a new one.

Flitcraft never wanted to
go back to his old life.

That was
kind of the point.

Thank you, Grand Inquisitor.

I'll try to remember that.


Hmm. Where do you want me
to move the queen?

Should I?

Are you all right?

What happened?

I...

negotiated
with the Rajah.

How did you know
where to find her?

I have my ways.

God, you really do.

Let's continue.

It's your turn?

You can't go.

Oh, please.
Don't even say it.

Neither one of us
is going to convince him.

I'm going to see Nikolai.

You absolutely are not.

This-- All of this
ends tonight.

You owe me nothing.
That's not true.

Go to him.

How can you keep doing this to me?
To you?

I'm doing this <i>for</i> you.
They'll kill you.

Maybe not.
I could get unlucky.

[church bell tolling]
Please, listen.

Listen to me.
Please don't leave.

Don't leave me again.

Porphyria, don't do this.
Not now.

It doesn't have
to be like this.

If the Rajah's really dead,
then Nikolai's gonna leave us alone.

He will!
Please.

Even if by some miracle
that was true,

I need to see him...

one last time.

You don't have to be
so invulnerable, you know?

Whatever happened to
the beautiful boy that I knew,

the boy that saved me,
the boy that I loved?

Please.

What happened?

That boy,
the one you loved,

that little boy
who loved you so,

his mother
killed herself.

He never knew
his father.

No.

He only ever wanted...

the one thing
he could never have.

Over the years,

I have murdered
many, many people.


The first one I killed was
that innocent little boy.

I'll do anything.
I'll do anything.

No.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my...

<i>You see before you</i>
<i>Nikolai's place.</i>

<i>A millionaire built it at the turn
of the century as his lasting legacy.</i>

<i>Strangely enough, he fired the
architect he first brought on</i>

<i>and hired a young $5.00 a
week draftsman named George.</i>

[door buzzer]
<i>Nobody really knows why.</i>

<i>I hope George was getting</i>
<i>more than $5.00 a week</i>

<i>when he delivered</i>
<i>these blueprints.</i>

Slowly.
Hands raised.

<i>My old friend Kolya.</i>

You know the way.

<i>Ever loyal, ever dangerous.</i>

It is pointless
to ask you to leave, yes?

Of course.

You ever find
a gun you like?

Sure.

The other guy's.


Still so much gallows humor
for such a young man,

especially one
so reluctant to die.

Not reluctant.

Just resilient.

Like you taught me to be.

Yes.

Resilient.

Come.

Do you remember the story of
the man who designed this place?

Tell me again, please.

Untrained as an architect,

he only agreed to design this place
after he consulted his brother,

his dead brother,
using a Ouija board.

Oh, that kooky
George.

Yes. Kooky.

<i>Sadly, this place was George's</i>
<i>one moment of brilliance.</i>

<i>He actually became</i>
<i>a full-fledged architect,</i>

<i>but an undistinguished one.</i>

<i>It seems either school</i>
<i>or this building</i>

<i>conspired to suck all the</i>
<i>creative genius out of George.</i>

<i>Still, if you had to have one instance
of divine inspiration and achievement,</i>

<i>not bad.</i>

Wait here,
please.

<i>Soon, Nikolai's men</i>
<i>will enter this room,</i>

<i>ready to kill me.</i>

<i>Seems like a good time</i>
<i>to catch up on my sleep.</i>

It's time.

[guns cocking]

[elevator whirring]

[gates opening]

<i>And there he is,</i>
<i>the man himself.</i>

<i>Thank God.</i>

<i>He still doesn't miss a beat.</i>

<i>These B-movie mongrels</i>
<i>still belong to him.</i>

Gentlemen?

<i>They don't know the history</i>
<i>between all of us.</i>

Is he clean?

As ever.

Very well.

[speaking Russian]

You know, in this light,
I can almost see your cousin.

But it is the resemblance to
your father that stops the mind.

You agree, Kolya?

Wow.

Something wrong?

No.

This is just a very,
very big basement.

Has it been so long
since you last saw it?

I think not.

Still, I was hoping to be
spared all this pain.

Once, seeing you
was like a benediction.

And now?

Now, why do this
to my adopted son?

<i>Rats.</i>

<i>There goes all the small talk</i>
<i>I was looking forward to.</i>

It's been so long
since I've seen Porphyria.

<i>Liar.</i>

Her daughter, of course,
is a revelation.

Alas, I would regret the way
things have turned out

if I thought we, each of us,
could do anything about it.


Next?

Not bad, Little Boy Blue,
but your kick lacks power.

You need to bring the force
up through your leg,

into your hips,

chamber your kick
and then explode.

<i>Much better.</i>

Rise and shine, mate.

No. No.

Nikolai.

Cousin...
Don't you dare do this.

Don't you dare!

Stop this!

Not him!

Cousin.

What are you waiting for?
Pull the bloody trigger.

No!

It's better you
than these bastards.

Please. I can't.

Now pull
that bloody trigger.

Pull that trigger!

Nikolai!

Pull the trigger!

You can't do this!

I'll see you
on the other side.

Cousin.

Forgive me.


<i>[groans]</i>

<i>Not so bad.</i>

<i>Only one candidate</i>
<i>for the tooth fairy.</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

<i>I almost forgot</i>
<i>what they did, what I did.</i>

Radiant dawn, my son.

I used to have a watch
just like that.

It was given to me
many years ago.

I'm sorry about your cousin.

You did not deserve
his loyalty.

Neither did I.

Will it truly be
a relief to die?

Not sure.

Never been dead yet.

Your situation,

our situation,

reminds me of the books I
enjoyed when I was a younger man.

I suppose there was no choice,

considering
who your parents are.

Do you want to know the truth
about your father?

I guess the answer
depends on who he was.

Or is.

Before you die,
I will tell you.

But first,
I have a question.

Why not kill him
with dignity?

This grotesque thing
you have done,

trapping him in his body
to die a slow, terrible death.

Why?

I suppose I was
feeling metaphorical.

Not good enough.

Why then surface here?

You won't like
the answer.

How do you know?

It's not very romantic.

Doesn't need to be.

A part of me knew you would
choose to face me alone.

You're right.

Not very romantic.

Why then the sadness
when victory is imminent?

There was a time
when I thought--

maybe even hoped--

that you truly
were the one.

You don't think I am?

You think
that two-faced fate

has destined you
to take my life?

You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

Then what are
we talking about?

Why this intimate
face-to-face

when you could have
killed so long ago?

You had so many
opportunities over the years.

Do you truly need to
see me die by your hand?

What makes you sure that I will
be the one who dies this night?

I who taught the Rajah
the ways of the knife.

I who taught maybe even your
father the ways of the knife.

I who taught you...

the ways of the knife.

That was a very,
very long time ago.

There are those who say
that amongst the masters,

the fight is won and lost
in the minds of the combatants

before either one
makes a move.

Are you now
one such master, my son?

How do you expect to survive
against all these men in these halls?

How do you expect to survive against
your bastardized, unfulfilled life?

How do you expect
to survive against me?

Because...

I want to kill you
more than you want to live.

<i>Nikolai always</i>
<i>goes for the heart.</i>

<i>He never missed...</i>

<i>- until now.</i>
<i>-</i> Your father--

Shh.

<i>For want of a tooth,</i>
<i>a kingdom was lost.</i>

<i>Like I always say,</i>

<i>some things are</i>
<i>better left in the dark.</i>

<i>One bullet out of ten</i>
<i>in the clip.</i>

<i>Rounds two and three.</i>

<i>Four.</i>

Das vadanya, <i>Nikolai.</i>

<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

<i>Damn. Five was low.</i>

<i>Try six on for size.</i>

<i>Here comes seven and eight.</i>

<i>Just as I thought,</i>
<i>as rotten as Denmark.</i>

<i>Nine, ten.</i>



Always sleeping on the job.

Wake up.


Come on, wake up.
What are you doing here?

You know how it is.

Weekend, out cruising with
the boys, looking for a party.

You look better than usual.

I imagine you slept through
all this mayhem

and really had nothing
to do with any of it.

You know
I never carry a gun.

How are you still alive?

Now, you tell her
this is the last time.

I don't owe her any more
favors, thank God.

You, I owe a couple more,

but somehow I don't think
you're ever gonna collect.

<i>I hope you're right,</i>
<i>good Pavlovitch.</i>

<i>I seem to be experiencing</i>
<i>a bit of an epiphany.</i>

So long, brother.

<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

<i>I feel like I've been</i>
<i>part of a job well done.</i>

The operative word
being "done."

<i>Can you hear me, Mother?</i>

<i>I could really use</i>
<i>some help right now.</i>


[loud groaning]

<i>I wonder when George</i>
<i>realized this place was it,</i>

<i>that he would never achieve</i>
<i>such heights again.</i>

<i>Did George know his father?</i>

<i>Did George kill his father?</i>

<i>If can just do what you did,</i>
<i>dear Mother,</i>

<i>and make a leap of faith.</i>

<i>But so far, just enough for</i>
<i>Mr. Newton's messy lesson.</i>

<i>Just enough for 32 feet per</i>
<i>second squared to take over.</i>

<i>Almost there, Mother.</i>

<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

<i>I guess there's goes plan B.</i>

<i>Damn.</i>


<i>Body's broken...</i>

<i>and I'm losing blood fast...</i>

<i>but not fast enough.</i>






Lyovshka.

Why?


Why?

Tell me why.

They would have killed you.

And yet you would kill
yourself in the process?

If necessary.

Necessary?

Did you ever stop and think for
a second what that would do to me?

Please don't.

Look at me.

Look at me.

No...

What's that?

What's this?

After all your silly posturing,
you want to do this?

Please go away!

Please stop!

Just go.

You come into my life,

you come into my daughter's
life for what? For this?

Go away!

Why?

Why? Why?

Why? It's not fair!

Why? Why?
Look at me! Look at me!

Why?


It will do more damage
this way.

No, no.

No. We cannot!

You sent me away!

You never asked me
to return!

I did.
Every single day, I did.

I just never used words.


Please. Please stop.
Stop thinking.

Stop listening to yourself
and listen to me.

Listen to me.

I have always loved you.

Always so much.

I always shall, I promise.
Oh, God.

[speaking Russian]

You're lying.
You love me.

Nothing about me...
is honest.

Nothing about us...
is honest.

Don't lie. Don't.


Go.

Oh, God.

I love you!

Porphyria!

Mommy?

No! No!

No.
Why?

You must go back to him.
Why?

You must go back to her.
You're her mother.

Please... don't.

Don't leave me now.
Not now.

Please...

Please...

Porphyria!

Oh, my God.

After this last time...

I will never
leave you again.

Porphyria!

What's wrong?

Nothing, Ivan.

Nothing.

Everything is finally perfect.

What is it?

There are certain things
we shall never know.

I have never allowed myself
to be happy, Ivan.

I'm going to try it
for a change.

And where is he?

Are you certain
he didn't bleed to death?

You want me
to go and find him?

No.

This world is not kind
to those like him.

Might have been better
if he... if he died.

What can he do now?
He has no cause to fight.

He has only a dream
that will drive him mad.

Ivan, you promised.

Insanity is hereditary,
you know.

He has too much
of his mother in him.

Thank God.

That's his best part.

But like you, my dear,

he is his
father's child, too.

Whoever that truly was.

Between brothers...

especially
those brothers...

the bloodline is
too much the same.

I know.

<i>I told you it would not end</i>
<i>like it began.</i>

<i>Not really.</i>

<i>This is a happy ending,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

<i>And the kind of story</i>
<i>we've been thinking of</i>

<i>isn't supposed to have</i>
<i>a happy ending.</i>

But this is the happiest ending
for all of us.

<i>You see, in our own way,</i>
<i>she is mine and I am hers.</i>

<i>Perfection and imperfection.</i>

<i>That is why</i>
<i>I close my eyes now.</i>

<i>I realize what</i>
<i>she has taught me.</i>

<i>An imperfect sleep can be</i>
<i>the most perfect one of all.</i>

<i>And now that I have had</i>
<i>a perfect sleep,</i>

<i>I will finally have</i>
<i>a different kind of sleep,</i>

<i>a sleep from which</i>
<i>I will never awaken again.</i>

<i># He's just a ghost #</i>

<i># A ghost of the past #</i>

<i># He was brought back #</i>

<i># For some foolish dream #</i>

<i># Bereft and betwixt #</i>

<i># A world yet unknown #</i>

<i># Out of the past #</i>

<i># He walks on #</i>

<i># The heat of his love #</i>

<i># Has made him cold #</i>

<i># The blood will run deep</i>
