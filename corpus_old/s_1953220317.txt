[LASER FIR ING AND PEOPLE SHOUTING]

Enjoying family time?

My family has other plans.

[PEOPLE SCREAMING]

[LASER CHARGING]

Batman. I was wondering when--

[LAUGHING IN DISTANCE]

Oh. Boy Wonder.

The Bat sent you
to drag me off to prison?

Frankly , I'm underwhelmed.

-Great. But I'm kind of in a hurry here.
-Kids. Always in such a rush.

Not talking to you.




Finally .
I was wondering what a guy had to do...

...to get a little attention around here.


Junior's doing this for attention?

I'm telling you now,
this little distraction better not interfere.


Ha-ha-ha. Kid had a glass jaw.

Hilarious. Can we go? Today's the day.

Don't tell me you're not excited.

Right now, my king,
I'm more focused on the matter at hand.

[ALL GRUNTING]

-Well?
-Yes, I'm excited. Today's the day.

Stealing ice? Seriously ?

Isn't that a bit cliché,
even for Captain Cold ?

Come on. We don't have time for this.


Calm down, Kid.

Oh, please. You'll chat it up with the cops,
with bystanders...

...with Cold , even.
No. No way. Today is the day.

-Today's the day.
-Welcome to the Hall of Justice.

Headquarters of the Justice League.

KID FLASH :
Oh, man.

I knew we'd be the last ones here.

[CROWD CHATTERING]

MAN 1 : Is that Batman?
WOMAN: Oh, my goodness.

-I see Flash and Flash Jr.
MAN 2: His name's Speedy. Duh.

MAN 3: Speedy's Green Arrow's sidekick.
MAN 4: Well, that makes no sense.

-Ready to see the inner sanctum?
-Born that way.

I'm glad we're all here.

Have all four sidekicks ever been
in the same place at the same time?

Don't call us sidekicks. Not after today.

Sorry. First time at the Hall.
I'm a little overwhelmed.

You're overwhelmed.
Freeze was underwhelmed.

Why isn't anyone ever just whelmed?

Oh. Maybe that's why.

Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, Kid Flash.

Welcome.

You now have unlimited access
to the gym, our fully -stocked galley...

...and, of course, our library.

Make yourselves at home.

Quick debrief to discuss
the coincidence of four ice villains...

...attacking on the same day.

We shouldn't be long.

COMPUTER:
Recognized Batman, zero two.

Aquaman, zero six.

Flash, zero four.

Green Arrow, zero eight.

Martian Manhunter, zero seven.

Red Tornado, one six.

SPEEDY:
That's it?

You promised us a real look inside,
not a glorified backstage pass.

It's a first step.
You've been granted access few others get.

Oh, really ?

Who cares which side of the glass
we're on?

Roy, you just need to be patient.

What I need is respect.

They're treating us like kids.

Worse, like sidekicks.

We deserve better than this.

You're kidding, right?

You're playing their game? Why?

Today was supposed to be the day.

Step one in becoming full -fledged members
of the League.

Well, sure. But I thought step one
was a tour of the H.Q.

Except the Hall
isn't the League's real H. Q.

I bet they never told you.
It's a false front for tourists...

...and a pit stop for catching Zeta Beam
teleporter tubes to the real thing...

...an orbiting satellite
called the Watchtower.

I know, I know.

But I thought
maybe we could make an exception.

Or not.

You are not helping your cause here, son.
Stand down, or--

Or what? You'll send me to my room?

And I'm not your son. I'm not even his.

I thought I was his partner.

But not anymore.

Guess they're right about you three.

You're not ready.

[COMPUTER BEEPING]

Superman to Justice League.

There's been an explosion
at Project Cadmus. It's on fire.

I've had my suspicions about Cadmus.

This may present
the perfect opportunity to--

ZATARA:
Zatara to Justice League.

The sorcerer Wotan is using the
Amulet of Aten to blot out the sun.

Requesting full League response.

-Superman?
-It's a small fire.

-Local authorities have it under control
-Then Cadmus can wait.

All L eaguers rendezvous
at Zatara's coordinates. Batman out.

-Stay put.
-What? Why?

This is a League mission.

-You're not trained.
-Since when?

I meant you're not trained
to work as part of this team.

There will be other missions.
When you're ready.

But for now, stay put.

-Glad you didn't bring you-know-who?
-Indeed.

Ugh. When we're ready?

How are we ever supposed to be ready
when they treat us like--

Like sidekicks.

My mentor. My king.
I thought he trusted me.

Trust? They don't even trust us
with the basics.

They've got a secret H.Q. in space.

What else aren't they telling us?

I have a better question.
Why didn't we leave with Speedy?

What is Project Cadmus?

Don't know. But I can find out.

COMPUTER: Access denied.
-Heh. Wanna bet?

Whoa. How are you doing that?

Same system as the Batcave.

COMPUTER:
Access granted.

All right, Project Cadmus.
Genetics lab here in D.C. That's all there is.

But if Batman's suspicious,
maybe we should investigate.

Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.

Hey, heh, they're all about justice.

But they said stay put.

For the blotting-out-the-sun mission,
not this.

Wait, are--? Are you going to Cadmus?
Because if you're going, I'm going.

Just like that?
We're a team on a mission?

We didn't come for a play date.

[SIR ENS WAIL ING]

-Help !
-Get us down!

Stay put. We will get you out.

[BOTH GRUNT]

Whoa-- Unh.

It's what's-his-name. Flash Boy.

Kid Flash. Why is that so hard?

So smooth.

Does he always have to run ahead?
We need a plan. We--

-Robin?
ROBIN: Ha-ha-ha.

-Whoa.
-I need to borrow that.

Step aboard. Now.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

Appreciate the help .

You handled it.
Besides, we're here to investigate.

Poetic justice, remember?

-There was something in the....
-Elevators should be locked down.

This is wrong.

Thought so.

This is a high-speed express elevator.
It doesn't belong in a two-story building.

Neither does what I saw.


And that's why they need
an express elevator.

I'm at the end of my rope.

Bypassing security.

There. Go.


ROBIN:
Welcome to Project Cadmus.

Kid, wait.

Aah! Oof.



No. Nothing odd going on here.


Dr. Desmond.

Tell me, Guardian, what part of
no interruptions did you not understand?

A G-Gnome on Sub-Level 26
reports three intruders.

-Ugh. Did I miss a perimeter breach alert?
-No.

Then the G-Gnome's confused.

Whatever might occur
in our faux lab above ground...

...the real Cadmus
is the most secure facility in D.C.

My job to keep it that way.

Fine. Take a squad.

Might I recommend Guardian
leave his G-Gnome behind?

If violence should occur....

-The little guy would be in my way.
-No.

The advantage of
instant telepathic communication...

...outweighs other concerns.

I need my G-Gnome with me at all times.

Okay, I'm officially whelmed.

This is how they hide this massive
underground facility from the world .

The real Cadmus isn't on the grid.

It generates its own power
with these things.

Must be what they're bred for.

Even the name is a clue.

The Cadmus of myth created a new race
by sowing dragon's teeth into the earth.

And this Cadmus creates new life too.

Let's find out why.

They call them Genomorphs.

Look at the stats on these things.
Super-strength, telepathy, razor claws.

These are living weapons.

They're engineering an army.
But for who?

Wait, there's something else .
Project K-R.

-The file 's triple -encrypted, I can't --
GUARDIAN : Don't move!


-Wait. Robin? Aqualad? Kid Flash?
-At least he got your name right.

-I know you. Guardian. A hero.
-I do my best.

-Then, what are you doing here?
-I'm chief of security.

You're trespassing.

But we can call the Justice League.
Figure this out.

You think the League's gonna approve
of you breeding weapons?

Weapons? What do you--?

What have I - -?

Ugh.

My head.

Take them down hard. No mercy.


[ALL GRUNTING]

[ALARM WAIL ING]


Way to be a team player, Rob.

Weren't you right behind me?


-We're headed down?
-Dude, out is up.

Excuse me? Project K-R?
It's down on Sub-Level 52.

This is out of control.

Perhaps....

Perhaps we should contact the League.

[DINGS

We are already here.


-Which way?
-Yeah.

Bizarre-looking hallway one
or bizarre-looking hallway two?

DUBBIL EX:
Hold .

They are headed for Project K-R.

[YELLS


Hurry!


-I disabled the door. We're safe.
-We're trapped.

Uh, guys? You'll wanna see this.

Whoa.

Big K, little R.
The atomic symbol for Krypton.

-Clone?
-Robin. Hack.

Right, right.

''Weapon designation Superboy.

A clone force-grown in 16 weeks...

-...from DNA acquired from Superman.''
-Stolen from Superman.

No way the big guy knows about this.

Solar suit allows him to absorb
yellow sun radiation 24/7.

And these creatures?

Genomorph-Gnomes. Telepathic.
Force-feeding him an education.

And we can guess what else .

They're making a slave out of,
well, Superman's son.

Now we contact the League.

[BEEPS

No signal.

We're in too deep. Literally .


They're still in there? With the weapon?

We can't get the door open.

-Use your telekinesis.
-I have tried to no avail.

Useless. This is a debacle .

Get some G-Trolls down here
to muscle the door open. Now.

Already on their way.

You realize once we get in there,
we can't ever let them leave?

Doc, these aren't your
typical meddling kids.

You don't want to get on the wrong side
of the Justice League.

Better than getting on the wrong side
of the Cadmus board of directors...

...believe me.

Contact the G-Gnomes inside K-R.

This is wrong.

We can't leave him like this.

Set him free. Do it.

[JOINT S CRACKING]


-Whoa! Hang on, Supey.
-We're on your side.


I don't wanna do this.


Aah!


Enough!

Ugh. Ung-- Ugh.

We are trying to help you.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

Attaboy.

[English - US - SDH]

Dr. Desmond.
You require an audience with the Light?

Yes. Very sorry to disturb you
at this late hour--

-Just make your report.
-Of course. Ahem.

Well, we had a small fire here
at Project Cadmus.

The origin of the incident
is still unclear...

...but it seems to have attracted
some unwanted attention.

Three sidekicks,
Robin, Aqualad and Kid Flash...

...breached security.

They found and released the Weapon.

The Superboy.

Of course, the clone is under
our telepathic control. ..

...and, as ordered,
turned against his would -be liberators.

The three are contained and we don't
believe the League knows they're here.

Uh....

What should I do with them?

Clone them.
The substitutes will serve the Light.

And only the Light.

And the originals?

Dispose of them. Leave no trace.

MALE VOICE :
Time runs short.

You must awaken.

You must awaken now!

[GASP S

What? What do you want?

Quit staring. You're creeping me out.

Uh, KF, how about we not tick off the guy
who can fry us with a look?

Prepare the cloning procedure
for the new Project Sidekick. Now.

Almost done here, doc.

Where's the Weapon?

Superboy? He carried the intruders
to the Cloning Chamber.

We have genomorphs for that.

Get the Weapon back in its pod now.

I don't see the harm
in letting the kid stretch his legs.

Don't you now?

That clone belongs in a cage.

We only sought to help you.

Yeah, we free you, and you turn on us.

-How's that for grati--?
-Kid, please, be quiet now.

I believe our new friend was not
in full control of his actions.

What if I - -? Hmm.

What if I wasn't?

He can talk ?

Yes, he can.

Not like I said ''it.''

The genomorphs taught you
telepathically .

They taught me much.

I can read, write.
I know the names of things.

But have you seen them?

Have they ever actually
let you see the sky or the sun?

Images are implanted in my mind,
but, no, I have not seen them.

Do you know what you are?
Who you are?

I am the Superboy. A genomorph.

A clone made from the DNA
of the Superman.

Created to replace him
should he perish.

To destroy him
should he turn from the Light.

To be like Superman
is a worthy aspiration.

But like Superman,
you deserve a life of your own.

Beyond that solar suit.

Beyond your pod.

Beyond Cadmus.

Ilive because of Cadmus.
It is my home!

Your home is a test tube.

We can show you the sun.

Uh, pretty sure it's after midnight,
but we can show you the moon.

We can show you,
introduce you to Superman.

No, they can't.

They'll be otherwise occupied.

Activate the cloning process.

Pass. Batcave's crowded enough.

And get the Weapon back in its pod.

Hey, how come he gets to call
Supey an ''it''?

Help us.

Don't start thinking now.

See, you're not a real boy.
You're a weapon.

And you belong to me.

Well, to Cadmus. Same thing.

Now get back to your pod.


Where's Dubbilex? Ooh! Ugh.

Lurking as usual.

Get the G-Gnomes
downloading their memories.

When that's done,
delete the source material.


Superboy, you live.

That gives you the right
to follow your own path.

A weapon or a person?
The choice is yours.

But ask yourself ,
what would Superman do?

[BANGING ON DOOR]

I told you to get back to your--

[ALL GRUNT]

Don't give me orders.

You here to help us or fry us?

Huh.

I don't seem to have heat vision,
so I suppose helping is my only option.

Ugh, finally . Lucky Batman isn't here.

He'd have my head
for taking so long.

Seriously ?
That's what you're worried about?

The whole League
will have our heads after tonight.

Free Aqualad. I'll get Kid Mouth.

Don't you give me orders either.


Thank you.

You--! You'll never get out of here.

I'll have you back in pods
before morning.

That guy is not whelmed.
Not whelmed at all.

What is it with you
and this ''whelmed'' thing?

Activate every genomorph in Cadmus.

We are still 42 levels below ground.

But if we can make the elevator....





Superboy. The goaI is escape,
not to bury ourselves here.

You want escape?

I -- I'm falling.

[GRUNTS

Superman can fly .

-Why can't I fly ?
-Don't know.

But you can leap tall buildings
in a single bound. Still cool.

Thank you.

Guys, this will have to be our exit.


MALE VOICE :
Turn left, brother.

Go left. Left.

MALE VOICE : Turn right.
-Right.

Great directions, Supey.
You trying to get us re-podded?

No, I don't understand.

Don't apologize. This is perfect.


-At this rate, we'll never get out.
-Shh.

Listen.



Someone, Robin, I'd wager,
hacked our systems...

...deactivating
internaI security cameras.

But he neglected the motion sensors.

Genomorphs are closing in.
They're all coming out in here.

We have them cornered.

Agh!

He hacked the motion sensors.

I hacked the motion sensors.

-Sweet.
-Still plenty of them between us and out.

But I've finally got room to move.

More behind us.

[GRUNTS

We'll cut them off at Sub-LeveI One.

We'd better,
or the Board will have our heads.

My head.

[ALARM BUZZES

I need to get something
from Project Blockbuster just in case.

I'll meet you at Sub-LeveI One.

[ALARM WAIL ING]

Oh, crud. Unh!

We're cut off from the street.

Thanks, my head hadn't noticed.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

Can't hack this fast enough.

This way.

[ALL GROWLING]

[ALL GROAN]

MALE VOICE :
Perhaps, for the sake of all genomorphs...

...our brother Superboy
should make up his own mind.

SUPERBOY: It was you.
-Yes, brother.

I set the fire and lured your new friends
down into Cadmus...

...woke them when they were in danger.

SUPERBOY:
And guided me. Why?

Because you are our hope,
the genomorph hero.

You will blaze a trail for all our brothers,
showing us the way to freedom.


What's going on?

[GRUNTS

What is your choice, brother?

I choose freedom.

Feels like fog lifting.

-Guardian?
-Go.

-I'll deal with Desmond.
-I think not.

Project Blockbuster will give me the power
to restore order to Cadmus.



Everyone, back.

[ALL GRUNTING]

Okay, that's one way
to bust through the ceiling .

-You think Lab Coat planned that?
-I doubt he is planning anything anymore.


Learned that one in kindergarten.

[ALL GRUNTING]

Of course.

KF, get over here.

-Got it?
-Got it.

Go.

Got your nose.

ROBIN:
Superboy. Aqualad.

Come and get me, you incredible bulk .

No. Ugh.

-Ugh!
-This one and that one.

Sorry, try again.


Move!

Agh.


We did it.

Was there ever any doubt?

[BOTH GROAN]

KID FLASH :
See?

The moon.

Oh, and Superman.

Do we keep our promises or what?

Is that what I think it is?

He doesn't like being called an ''it.''

I'm Superman's clone.

Start talking.


We'll, uh--
We'll figure something out for you.

The League will, I mean.

For now, I'd better make sure they get that
Blockbuster creature squared away.

Cadmus will be investigated.

All 52 levels.

-But let's make one thing clear.
-You should have called.

End results aside, we are not happy.

You hacked Justice League systems...

...disobeyed direct orders
and endangered lives.

You will not be doing this again.

I am sorry, but we will.

Aqualad, stand down.

Apologies, my king. But no.

We did good work here tonight.
The work you trained us to do.

Together, on our own,
we forged something powerful, important.

If this is about your treatment at the Hall,
the three of you--

The four of us. And it's not.

Batman, we're ready
to use what you taught us.

Or why teach us at all?

Why let them tell us what to do?

It's simple :
Get on board, or get out of the way.

BATMAN: This cave was the originaI
Secret Sanctuary of the Justice League.

We're calling it into service again.

Since you four are determined
to stay together and fight the good fight...

...you'll do it on League terms.

Red Tornado volunteered to live here
and be your supervisor.

Black Canary's in charge of training.

I will deploy you on missions.

-Real missions?
-Yes, but covert.

The League will still handle
the obvious stuff.

There's a reason
we have these targets on our chests.

But Cadmus proves
the bad guys are getting smarter.

Batman needs a team
that can operate on the sly .

-The five of you will be that team.
-Cool. Wait. Five?

This is the Martian Manhunter's niece,
Miss Martian.

Hi.

Liking this gig more every minute.

Welcome aboard. I'm Kid Flash.

That's Robin. Aqualad.
It's cooI if you forget their names.

I'm honored to be included.

Hey, Superboy. Come meet Miss M.

Ilike your T-shirt.

Today is the day.

GUARDIAN :
Cadmus changes today.

With Desmond out of the picture,
the Board's placed me in charge.

Dr. Spence,
you're Acting Chief Scientist.

No more G-Gnomes
suppressing our wills .

No more secret breeding projects.

This is a kinder, gentler Cadmus.

DUBBIL EX: Then I will , of course,
help in any way I can , brother.

Can the Light afford to leave Guardian
in charge without the G-Gnomes?

We have subtler means of control

What concerns me is the children.

We now know the League is willing to
employ young heroes to do their dirty work.

That's a dark twist.

Yes, but one that can be played
to our advantage.

Even the temporary loss of the Weapon
may prove useful

Eventually, everyone sees the Light.

[English - US - SDH]


You again.

I'm starting to get insulted Green Arrow's
not messing up my operations personally .

[GRUNTS

Do you know what I pay
for a suit in my size?

Scorch the earth, boys.


[ROBIN L AUGHING]


The cave is perfect.
It has everything the team will need.

For covert missions.
You know, spy stuff.

Wait till you see Superboy
and Miss Martian. But I saw her first.


Ha, ha. Tell A rrow he shouldn't send boys
to do a man's job.

Go ahead.

High-density polyurethane foam. Nice.

So, Speedy, you in?

Pass.

I'm done letting Arrow
and the League tell me what to do.

I don't need a babysitter or
a clubhouse hang-out with the other kids.

Your Junior Justice League is a joke.

Something to keep you busy
and in your place.

I don't want any part of it.

COMPUTER:
Recognized: Robin-B-01.

Kid Flash -B-03.

-Did you ask him?
-What did he say?

He's arriving now.

Then what are we waiting for?

Red Tornado.

Greetings. Is there a reason
you intercept me outside the cave?

We hoped you had a mission for us.

Mission assignments
are the Batman's responsibility .

-It's been over a week and--
-You will be tested soon enough.

For the time being,
simply enjoy each other's company.

This team is not a sociaI club.

No. But I am told sociaI interaction
is an important team-building exercise.

Perhaps you can keep busy
by familiarizing yourseIf with the cave.

''Keep busy.''

-Does he think we're falling for this?
-Oh, I'll find out.

COMPUTER:
Recognized: Red Tornado-16.

I'm sorry. I forgot he's a machine.

Inorganic. I cannot read his mind.

Nice try, though.

So, uh, you know what I'm thinking
right now?

-We all know what you're thinking now.
-Ow.

And now we tour the clubhouse.

Well, Superboy and I live here.
We can play tour guides.

-Don't look at me.
-We won't.

A private tour sounds much more fun.

She never said private.

Team-building. We'll all go.

[WALLY GRUNTS

M'GANN:
So this would be our front door.

And this would be the back.

-The cave is actually the entire mountain.
WALLY: It was hollowed out and reinforced...

...by Superman and Green Lantern
in the early days of the League.

Then why abandon it
for the Hall of Justice?

The cave's secret location
was compromised.

So they traded it in for a tourist trap?
Yeah, that makes sense.

If villains know of the cave,
we must be on constant alert.

Bad guys know we know they know
about the place. They'd never look here.

He means we're hiding in plain sight.

Ah, that's much clearer.

[SNIFFS

I smell smoke.

Ahh, my cookies.

I was trying out Grammy Jones'
recipe from episode 1 7 of--

-Uh, heh. Never mind.
-I bet they'd have tasted great.

He doesn't seem to mind.

I have a serious metabolism.

I'll make more?

-It was sweet of you to make any.
-Thanks, Aqualad.

We're off-duty. Call me Kaldur' Ahm.

Actually , my friends call me Kaldur.

I'm Wally . See, I already trust you
with my secret ID ...

...unlike Mr. Dark Glasses over here.

Batman's forbidden Boy Wonder
from telling anyone his real name.

Mine's no secret. It's M'gann M'orzz.

But you can call me Megan.
It's an Earth name, and I'm on Earth now.

Don't worry, Superboy.

[GASP S

We'll find you an Earth name too.

Get out of my head!

M'GANN:
What's wrong? I don't understand.

Everyone on Mars
communicates telepathically.

M'gann, stop.

Things are different on Earth.

Here, your powers are
an extreme invasion of privacy.

Besides, Cadmus' creepy little psychic
G-Gnomes left a bad taste in his brain.

I didn't mean to--

Just stay out.

Hello , Megan. I know what we can do.

Superboy, please?

Don't talk to me.

It's my Martian Bio-Ship.

Cute. Not aerodynamic, but cute.

It's at rest, silly . I'll wake it.

Well, are you coming?

Strap in for launch.

Oh!

Cool.

Red Tornado, please open the bay doors.

Incredible .

She sure is.

I mean, the ship,
which, like all ships, is a she.

Fast with his feet...

-...not so much with his mouth.
-Dude.

I may not have psychic powers,
but I can guess what you're thinking.

You overreacted
and you don't know how to apologize.

Just say sorry.

-[WHISPERING] He'll come around.
-He doesn't seem to like me much.

You guys remember
he has super-hearing, right?

[IN NORMAL VOICE] How about showing
us a little Martian shape-shifting?

Is it wrong that I think I'm hot?

Impressive.

But you know you're not exactly
gonna fool anyone with those.

Mimicking boys is a lot harder.

-And your clothes?
-They're organic, like the ship.

They respond to my mental commands.

As long as they're the only ones.

Can you do that ghosting-through-walls
that Manhunter does?

Density-shifting?

No. It's a very advanced technique.

Flash can vibrate his molecules
right through a wall.

Ha-ha-ha. When he tries it, bloody nose.

Dude.

Here's something I can do.

Camouflage mode.

RED TORNADO [OVER RADIO]:
Red Tornado to Miss Martian.

An emergency alert has been triggered
at the Happy Harbor Power Plant.

I suggest you investigate, covertly .

-I'm sending coordinates.
-Received. Adjusting course.

Tornado's keeping us busy again.

M'GANN:
Well, a simple fire led you to Superboy.

We should find out
what caused the alert.

I think I know the cause.


[WORKERS SCREAMING]

Robin, are tornadoes common
to New England? Robin?

[ROBIN L AUGHING]

He was just here.

[GRUNTS

Who's your new friend?

Didn't catch his name,
but he plays kind of rough.

My apologies.
You may address me as Mr. Twister.

[GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]

MR. TWISTER: I was prepared
to be challenged by a superhero.

I was not, however, expecting children.

We're not children.

Objectively , you are.

Have you no adult supervision?

I find your presence here
quite disturbing.

DICK :
Well, we hate to see you disturbed.

Let's see if you're more turbed
once we kick your can.

[SHOUTS

Indeed, that was quite turbing.

Thank you.

-What have you done to my team?
-Embarrassed them, largely .

M'GANN: I got you, Wally .
-Thanks.

I would have thought you had all learned
your limitations by now.

What do you want?

MR. TWISTER:
Isn't it obvious?

I'm waiting for a real hero.

-Read his mind. Find a weakness.
-I thought I wasn't supposed to do that.

It's okay with the bad guys.

Nothing. I'm getting nothing.

Hello , Megan.

Mr. Twister is Red Tornado in disguise.

He's inorganic. An android.

And how many androids do you know
that can generate tornados?

Red Tornado sent us here.

After saying we'd be tested soon enough.

This is his test.
Something to keep us busy.

Speedy called it. We're a joke.

[GRUNTS

This game, so over.

We know who you are
and what you want.

So let's end this.

Consider it ended.

An impressive show.

But we will not indulge you.
We will not engage.

[THUNDER CRASHING]

Uh, can Red Tornado do that?

You think I'm Tornado? Ironic.

[ALL SHOUT]

Fine, then.
I won't deny you children have power.

Playing hide-and-seek with you
will not help me achieve my objectives.

So stay concealed.

If you confront me again,
I will show no mercy.

-What happened?
-I placed the Bio-Ship between us.

[SUPERBOY SHOUTS

That supposed to make it right?

You tricked us into thinking
Twister was Red Tornado.

-She didn't do it on purpose.
-It was a rookie mistake.

-We shouldn't have listened.
WALLY: You are pretty inexperienced.

Hit the showers. We'll take it from here.

Stay out of our way.

I was just trying to be part of the team.

To be honest,
I'm not sure we really have a team.

[CAR ALARMS BLARING]

[ALL SHOUTING]

Certainly , this will get
the required attention.

You got ours, full and undivided.

ImmateriaI and insufficient.

You are a distraction
I can no longer tolerate.

[SCREAMS

The team really needs your help .

If I intervened, it would not be to help .

Still , it is an odd coincidence that this
Twister shares my elemental abilities.

And my immunity to telepathy.

Hello , Megan.

[GRUNTING AND SHOUTING]

You brought your utility belt?

''Never leave home without it.''
First thing Batman taught me.

Yeah, right after,
''Never go to the bathroom without it.''

M'GANN:
Listen to me, all of you.

-What did we tell you?
-I know, and I know I messed up.

But now I'm very clear on
what we need to do.

Please, trust me.

Get back! Everyone clear the area!

Hit the showers, boys.

I was hoping you could handle this.
Clearly you cannot.

But we've got a plan now.

The subject is not up for debate.

MR. TWISTER: I was beginning
to believe you'd never show up.

I'm here now.

We are evenly matched, Twister.

No, Tornado, we are not.

Remain still, android.

The reprogramming won't take long.

Longer than you might think.

No.

Foul. I call foul.

M'gann, no!

Don't know how things are done on Mars,
but on Earth we don't execute our captives.

You said you'd trust me.

That's why I couldn't read his mind.

Cool. Souvenir.

We should have had more faith in you.

Yeah, you rocked this mission.
Get it? Rocked? Heh.

DICK :
Ignore him.

We're just all turbed you're on the team.

M'GANN:
Thanks. Me too.

PROFESSOR: Now, Brom, aren't you
relieved I didn't let you wear the armor?

Extremely , professor.
But you're not upset?

I'm convinced our tracking program
was operational. ..

...and that the real Tornado
was somewhere in the vicinity.

Besides, you know science advances
in fits and starts.

Even failure can be instructive.

And I'd say we learned quite a lot today.

KALDUR: It was clearly created
to sabotage or destroy you.

RED TORNADO: Agreed.
-Is that why you wouldn't help us?

No. This was your battle .

I do not believe it is my role
to solve your problems for you.

Nor should you solve mine for me.

But if you're in danger--

Consider this matter closed.

Batman, Aquaman and Flash,
they'd have jumped right in to fix things.

Guess if we're gonna have a babysitter,
a heartless machine is exactly what we need.

-Dude, harsh.
RED TORNADO: And inaccurate.

I have a heart. Carbon-steeI alloy.

I also have excellent hearing.

Ha, right. Sorry.
I'll strive to be more accurate.

And more respectful.

Speedy was so wrong.

DICK : This team thing?
KALDUR: Might just work out.

Sorry.

HaiI Kobra. HaiI Kobra. HaiI Kobra.

We're approaching Santa Prisca.

BATMAN:
Isla Santa Prisca.

This island nation is the primary source
of a dangerous and illegaI neo-steroid.

A strength-enhancing drug,
sold under the street name Venom.

Infrared heat signatures indicate their
factory is still operating at full capacity...

...but all shipments of Venom
have been inexplicably cut off.

That's where this team comes in.

This is a covert, recon mission only .

Observe and report.

If the Justice League needs to intervene,
it will.

The plan requires two drop zones.

So who's in charge?

Work that out between you.

MISS MARTIAN :
Drop Zone A in 30.

-Ready.
-Putting Bio-Ship in camouflage mode.


[BEEPS

Heat and motion sensors are patched.

Data's now on a continuous loop.
Move in.

MISS MARTIAN :
Drop Zone B.

How cooI is this?

Very impressive.

Uh, that works too.

Hey, Supey. Not too late
to put on the new Stealth -Tech.

No capes. No tights. No offense.

MISS MARTIAN :
It totally works for you.

In that you can totally do good work
in those clothes.

[ALL GRUNT]

Knew I didn't need a line .

And yet creating a seismic event may not
have helped us much with the covert.

Aqualad. Drop B is go.

Head for the factory. I'll track your GPS
and rendezvous ASA P.

Roger that.

[TWIGS SNAPPING]

-Did you hear that?
-Uh, no.

Wait, is this a super-hearing thing?

You do have great ears.

Okay, Rob, now what?

Man, I hate it when he does that.

Superboy, Kid. Switch to Infrared.
See if you're being tracked.

KID FLASH :
Got a squad of armed bozos incoming.

SUPERBOY:
Two squads.

But they'll meet each other
before they find us.

[GUNFIR E]

No super-hearing required now.

AQUALAD [OVER RADIO]:
Swing wide. Steer clear.

Yeah, yeah. As soon as I find Rob.


[KID FLASH YELLS

[KID FLASH GRUNTING]

So much for the stealthy.

[GUNFIR E]

[KID FLASH YELLING]

[BOTH GRUNTING]

What is wrong with you guys?
Remember covert?

Why didn't you follow my lead?
Vanish into the jungle ?

That's what you were doing? Unh.
Way to fill us in.

We're not mind readers, you know.

[MISS MARTIAN & CULTIST GRUNTING]

Or I'm not, anyway.

You told me I could only read
the bad guys' minds.

[YELLS

I recognize those uniforms.
They belong to the Cult of the Kobra.

I'm certain Batman
would 've mentioned...

...if he knew a dangerous extremist was
running Santa Prisca's Venom operation.

Agreed. And since there's clearly no love
lost between the cultists and those goons...

...I'm betting Kobra came in
and tossed them out.

That's why normal supply lines
have been cut off.

We get it. Kobra wanted super-cultists.
Mystery solved.

-Radio and we'll be home in time for--
-These cultists aren't on Venom.

Kobra's hording the stuff.
We don't leave.

Not until I know why.

-Until you know why?
-This team needs a leader.

And it's you?

Dude, you're a 13-year-old kid
who ducked out on us without a word.

Heh, heh. And you're a mature 15?

You blew our cover first chance you got.

Don't you wanna lead?

-Heh. You?
-After the Mister Twister fiasco?

You did all right.

[BANE LAUGHING]

[IN ENGLISH]
Such clever ni?os.

But you only know half the story.

Let me show you the rest.

Get you into the factory
via my secret entrance.

There is a secret entrance.

But he's also hiding something.

Ah, ah, ah, chica.

Bane is not that easy.


He's mentally reciting football scores.
En espa?ol

-This could take a while .
BANE: It's not complicated.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

Sublime Master. He approaches.

Activate the radio-jamming net.

Nothing must interfere.

Look at all that product.
A buy is going down.

But if Kobra's not selling
to the usual suspects, then--

We need to identify that buyer.

Just what I was thinking.

Yeah, you're the thinker.

Sarcasm? Dude.

A real leader would focus
on getting answers.

[GRUNTS

Answers are this way.

So now EI Luchador is our leader.

[KID FLASH GRUNTS

[BUZZES

ROBIN:
All clear.

-Has that little fool already been caught?
-No. He just does that.

I'll get our intel
and be back before the Boy Wonder.

Wait, Kid--

Great chain of command.



It's a massive shipment.

SUPERBOY: Yeah, but they're only taking
new product off the line .

They're not touching this Venom.

Maybe freshness counts?

Helicopter's coming.

KID FLASH : What you got?
-Chemical formulas.

-I'm guessing it involves Venom, but--
KID FLASH : This one's Venom.

And that one's.... Whoa.

The Blockbuster formula from Cadmus.

Mixed correctly , Kobra's new juice
is three times stronger than Venom.

And permanent.

But how did Kobra get access
to Project Blockbuster?

Our mystery buyer
must also be Kobra's supplier...

...using the cult to create
a Blockbuster/Venom super-formula .

Robin to Aqualad. We've got....

[ST ATIC CRACKLING OVER RADIO]

Static.

SPORTSMAST ER: Lord Kobra.
-Sportsmaster.

The shipment is ready.

The new Kobra-Venom?

A complete success.

Our friends will not be disappointed.

SPORTSMAST ER:
This is a game-changer.

Finally , we can go mano a mano
with the Justice League.

MISS MARTIAN : Aqualad, sending you
a telepathic image of the buyer now.

Sportsmaster. He is the buyer.

Aqualad to Red Tornado, do you read?

[ST ATIC CRACKLING OVER RADIO]

Ugh. Can't reach the League,
Robin or Kid.

Comm's jammed.

We need a plan, now.

I have a suggestion.

[ALL GRUNTING]

-What is he--?
MAMMOTH: Grr. Unh.


Destroy them.

[MAMMOTH GROWLING]

[ALL GRUNTING]


[GROANS THEN YELLS]

Miss Martian, radio is jammed.
Link us up.

MISS MARTIAN : Everyone online?
SUPERBOY: Yeah.

KID FLASH : You know it, beautiful
AQUALAD: Good. We need to regroup.

ROBIN:
Busy now.

KOBRA: Batman must be desperate
if he sends his whelp to task me.

ROBIN: What's wrong, Kobie?
You look disconcerted.

This is beneath me.

Shimmer, take him.

AQUALAD:
Robin, now.

[SHIMMER COUGHING]

AQUALAD:
Strategic retreat. Kid, clear a path.

[GROWLS

[BUZZES

Superboy, the support beams.

How could my first mission as leader
go so wrong?

You do have the most experience.

But perhaps that is exactly
what has left you unprepared.

Fighting alongside Batman,
your roles are defined.

You two do not need to talk .
But this team is new.

And a leader must be clear, explicit.

He cannot vanish and expect others
to play parts in an unknown plan.

Oh, so I'm supposed to hold
everyone's hands.


Who am I kidding?

You should lead us, Kaldur.
You're the only one who can.

-Please, I can run circles--
ROBIN: Wally , Come on.

You know he's the one. We all do.

-Hello , Megan. It's so obvious.
-Could have told you.

Okay.

Then I accept the burden...

...until you are ready
to lift it from my shoulders.

You were born to lead this team.

Maybe not now. But soon.

Our first priority is preventing
that shipment from leaving this island.

Funny, I had the same thought.

SPORTSMAST ER:
Sabotage.

Robin?

Undoubtedly .

Find the problem. Fix it.

Master, shall we send search parties
after the intruders?

Don't be absurd. They'll come to us.

ROBIN:
Sportsmaster's the supplier-slash-buyer.

But it doesn't track.
He doesn't have the juice...

...to acquire the Blockbuster formula
or to get Kobra to do his dirty work.

And neither of them have the chops
to bond Blockbuster with Venom.

That took some major nerdage.

I believe the expression
is ''tip of the iceberg.''

Halt, ni?os.

I'm feeling explosive.


-You betrayed us. Why?
BANE: I want my factory back.

AQUALAD:
Kid, you'll need a running start.

BANE:
I forced you into a situation...

...where you would either take down
my enemies or die trying.

If the latter, the Justice League
would certainly have come...

...to avenge their sidekicks.

And when the smoke cleared,
Santa Prisca would be mine once more.

Blowing the tunnel with you inside
should have the same effect.

KID FLASH :
With what?

This trigger thingy?

[YELLS THEN GASP S

Finally . Drop him.

[BANE YELLS

The helicopter is operational, Exalted One.

Take the shipment.

[ALL GRUNTING]

-Go again?
MAMMOTH: Grr.

Sorry. Not the plan.

Souvenir.

-I know you hate getting your hands dirty.
-True.

But sometimes even a god
must stoop to conquer.

What's wrong, boy?
You look disconcerted.

[ROARS

SPORTSMAST ER:
Thanks for the workout, but I gotta fly .


[BOMBS EXPLODING]

[ALARM BLARING]

I am plagued by mosquitoes.

Good. Because this mosquito's
mighty concerted over your pain.

Another time, then.

We picked the right guy to lead.

Automatically making you the right guy
to explain this mess to Batman.

[ROBIN L AUGHING]

A simple recon mission.
Observe and report.

You'll each receive a written evaluation
detailing your many mistakes.

Until then, good job.

No battle plan survives first contact
with the enemy.

How you adjust to the unforeseen
is what determines success.

And how you choose who leads
determines character.

All I recovered is a single ampoule
of Kobra-Venom.

BRAIN: Peut-étre, the drug can be
reverse-engineered.

Mais what of our young heroes?

First Cadmus, then Monsieur Twister.

Now Santa Prisca.

VANDAL SA VAGE:
Once is happenstance.

Twice is coincidence.

But three times is enemy action.

And enemies of the light must not stand.
