Title: Wacky DNA

Sometimes it's hard to know where you are.

What are you doing, where are you going?
Even when it's time

It's often hard to remember what you've done in the past.

Or what I want to do next

The next night is like the more abstract concept

I do not even have time to think about it.

The weather is mild and the sun is rising.

The ocean is beautiful and everything is going well.

At point A, you are someone At
point B, you are someone else.

At point C, you become another level...

Angle, fragment, field, area

Some people are very good at converting

Such a break

Others are harmed and unable to do so.

How are you today? James

Where is he? I feel shrunken on my back.

I do not understand where he is.

Do you know where you are? James

Of course New York I
mean, California.

You're not in California, but that does not matter.

Did you sleep well last night? James

I mean, are you asleep?

I slept very well, thank you.

Who is he? Why are you asking these questions?

Can you hear it? James

I have nothing, of course I can hear.
I heard your voice

So many questions are really hard to freak out

I can certainly hear, everyone can hear.

What about your arm? James

Arm?

Is not the arm here?

Look, is not it?

Ok look

Are they still running smoothly? James

Of course, in good
condition Can also fold

Very normal

Why did you ask my arm?

Just confirm, James.
Confirm your arm.

Is that you? James, his people

My people?

My people? I'm here
Right behind the arm

It's just that my people are not as full as their arms.
a little confused

It's not always here.

I can not wear it all the time.

Do you really know where you are? James

There are so many problems

This is the story of an actor
He is no longer acting

This is a story about your sister.
She is always...

Come without a trace

This is a story about his friend.

And its neighbors

I'm not sure I can tell Michael that.

I can not forget the fact that he killed his stepmother.

Entering and leaving home

Tight to each other

Intimacy

Tolerance

Patience

Restless

Even broke

How can anyone know?

How can anyone know?
These photos are in the town of Gayana Jones.

How can anyone know?

Filmed a few hours after the collective suicide

How can anyone know?
Filmed a few hours after the collective suicide

900 swollen bodies stacked on the floor

Including 200 children

There is a bucket full of cyanide nearby.

A few months ago, Pastor Jim Jones was in...

San Francisco People's Temple...
(I.e.

Proverbs in the pulpit

His followers are mostly poor blacks...

Donate Your Property

James

What happened?

James

What is it?
We're watching TV, thank you.

(I.e.

You blocked the TV.

"James, how are you doing this?"
As?

The flash is so bright

Are we watching TV?

She likes the pictures taken.

Right? Patricia

Right

Look

Where did the white shirt come from?

This one?
right

This shirt is blue

OK

What are you doing? To wash clothes

I have a little time now.

I just want to help you bend your shirt.

I know I'm wearing a white shirt today.

But I prefer the blue answer.

Blue, thanks for helping me fold clothes.

Do you believe in Jim Jones?

Do you believe in Jim Jones?

"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"

"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
Too much

"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"

"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
What happened?

What happened?

This pastor of St. Francis, Jim Jones

Created a hippie church or something

He and his followers left San Francisco

I moved somewhere in South America

Where did they move? Patricia

Patricia - Ghana

Is Ghana right?
Patricia That's right

In short, they all moved in and then...
My God.

Strange things happened, all of them...

They committed suicide, a total of 900 people

I mean, who's going to leave San Francisco?

Entering the jungles of South America?

Still following this type of person

He has thick hair.

Do not be funny, James.
These talents are dead.

Just died - I know,
I just want to say...

What to say? Those people

Follow this guy from San Francisco

In the depths of the jungles of South America

All because he has thick hair

Yes, it is not good.

God, you feel very upset.
Thick hair

I mean...

No

James...

I am only...

You really do not like people touching you, right?

Right

I go...

I'm going to the kitchen for a glass of water.

I'm going to pour a glass of water.

Go ahead

Do you want to drink?

Okay, I also want to drink water.

You know, I have a sense of accomplishment today.

I thought a lot when I was walking.

So I almost finished an entire article.

I mean, do you believe that?

I can finish an entire hike with a walk.

I'm walking at the same time

Did you know that some people love to use the word "simultaneously"?

In the UK, people love to say at the same time

For example

When I ate, the phone rang.

Replace "between" with "media"

I'm eating at the same time

Between the main course and dessert, the phone rang

Yes that's right.

You know, I really like your photo.

Thank you, I also like it.

A ship - This is a ship.

a sailing boat -
belongs to a fleet

At sea

At sea

Atlantic - Not the
Atlantic, James

I told you.

Do you remember what it is?

Indian Ocean

Right

Dolphins and whales in the sea

There is also the protagonist of the beluga whale

Okay, I'll pour water.

James is full of anxiety

Sometimes it's very easy to leave

The simplest thing can also form a storm

Restless moment

Hey, do you want to use a glass or a cup of tea?

I want to use water when I want to put water.

High water cup

Not a cup of tea

High water cup

a glass of water in a tall glass of water

Tall glass of water, not a cup of tea

I found this way from the kitchen to the living room.

Always confused me Although
crossing the kitchen aisle

It's a straight line in the living room.

The hallway still intrigues me.

It is neither a kitchen nor a living room

Only one corridor

The hallway is between the kitchen and the living room

What happened to the hall?

Oh, it's more than it seems.

I know

This glass is for you.

Thank you

Give this cup to me

Go ahead

Thank you

Oh...

Suddenly, I felt I was not so thirsty.

Oh...

I do not know

Does that make you feel better? James

a soft microphone dial sound

"Are you going to disappoint me?"
"You know you will."

What is going to be?

I do not know

Patricia, this is my place.

Good Morning

Sleep well at night?

Not bad, and you?

"Hey, you can. That's good.

I woke up at 2:38 in the morning.

Uh

It's about 2:38 in the morning.

Or is it really 2:38?

It's 2:38 because I watched the clock.

OK

Yes

How are you sleeping? Patricia

I can hear your radio on and off in my room.

It's like a Morse password
Okay

I turned on the radio and tried to guess.

When will the next song be played?

But if I open it, it's an advertisement.

So I have to turn it off.

(I.e.

So

It's like you're doing
something Though it's not

You do not turn the radio off

Turn the switch off, you did it at least.

Makes sense, James, Catherine is right.

So many things, at least one piece was completed.

Which one?

Change my radio?
"That's right.

I just want to focus on writing more.

Is that you? Patricia

I heard you turn on the radio for a while.

I did some work.

What work?

My work

Excuse me, what work?

"What are you busy with?"
Some things about me

She also has her own business.

Some things related to notebook

Yes I know

I'm just wondering with what big things she's busy with.

It's these things.
OK

What the hell is she doing?

I do not know who knows

How can anyone know?

How can anyone know?

How can anyone know?
I know it's cold.

I noticed that.

Emotion

You have a way of getting your hair matted, right?

It's a disaster.
right

No, the hairstyle is good, very beautiful.

I just do not know where to start.

Do you think James is okay?

Why are you asking this?

I sometimes worry about him.

He is not bad

I guess

God, what happened?

Lots of pills, how many pills are there?

This is the moment At
point A, you are someone

At point B, you are someone else.

At point C, you become another level...

Angle, fragment, field, area

James, look there.

Make sure that all of you have been picked up

You do not want to leave your boss angry, right?

No, I do not want this.

Okay, how much better? James

Much better, much better, I can

I will not forget to pay.

Are you still inside?

You can not do this
How did you do it?

Mr. Police, he broke into my shop and made a mess.

Who is going to pay that?
"I... I'll pay, I..."

How much will I pay?

Mr. Police, I'm sorry.

I'm your aunt.

This child... he's not very comfortable.

In fact...
What's his aunt?

Yes, sir, I'm your aunt.

We live very close, he is a child

Mr. Sanik, I'm sorry to cause you loss.

I promise to repay you.

Come on, I have to get him home.

Crazy, do not forget your camera.

He's not crazy, give me the camera.

Pay attention to your attitude, young

You guy

You must be more careful, James.

The police can put you in jail

Honestly, I'm looking for something.

I accidentally fell, I do not know.

They are too big to make a big noise

I'm just looking for something.
Soda, soap, magazine or something.

Yes, you are looking for something, that's right.

Finding things that are all over the floor

Seriously, you can not do that.

Did the aspirin bottle get rid of me?

Or am I lost?

And my sunglasses?
Oh, this is mine.

I just got to point A, has point B, so...

I do not know how to get to point C.

James, are you still in the mood to make a joke?

Come on, I'll take you home.

Okay, sit down slowly.

You're home, okay?

You're home, come in.

What happened?

What the hell is happening?
Hey, Delmar

How are you doing?
Catherine.

God - Where did you find Him?

pharmacy - what?

I've always been careful

I'm trying to buy something, you know.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the store.

Of course, I went and explored

Then I saw this guy.

Do things all over the floor

because?
I do not know.

Delmar, you do not need to get so ruined.

Of course he has to explain clearly, James, quiet.

You are quiet.
"James, my God, James.

"You have to be more careful."
I have that.

Ok I just went into the store to find something.

"Then I lost."
"Yes, you are lost, very well.

The pharmacy has never been so confusing.

"Really."

I'm flying forward.

Thunder can not help saving it.

So, how did you do it?

This is the case, I said I'm your aunt

I do my best to keep you from the store.

I do not know why she's an aunt.

It does not matter, it does not matter anyway.

I have your help, thank you.

I suggest you do not stay near the pharmacy for now.

Otherwise, the police officer will find you here.

"I will not be surprised.
Police?

Yes, Mr. Sanik, he is very angry.

Did your sunglasses pay for it?

Really - James

You know, it's all that damn novel.

what?
it is not? Catherine

All because of the damn soap

James

When did you go to the store to buy soap?

No - That's...

He's not talking about a piece of soap.

He is referring to novel

Do not blame me for being rude, Delmar

You do not even know what you're talking about.

I stopped, I stopped - James,
do not speak loudly with Delmar.

I'm not getting fired.

But I do not want to talk now, can I?

I do not want to talk about soap.

old age - a year ago

A year ago things were old.

That's right.

Whether you are fired or not, this is not a key point.

You are a great actor

Among these crazy
plots Enjoy the magic

Your performance is not really covered.
"That's right.

In between

What?

You said that word.
He likes that word.

I said that? Does he like this?

What he likes?

Between that word?
Yes.

No

I do not like that word.

I just found out that people like
to say 'Cause no one said that

OK

At least they do not usually say that word

As I just said, your performance is great.

That's right.

You left the day when I was limp.

Watching, after 40 years
I watched, after 40 years

I know...

"I've heard you speaking hundreds of times.
James

I'm still grateful to you, Delmar.

But I still do not want to talk about it, can I?

I will not act again.

I'm writing a book? I'm a writer

Right

I'm tired, okay?
OK

I'm like this because I'm tired.

OK

But really, James, they should not let you go.

I swear I'll never look at the novel again.

What good looks are there without your game?

It's very good

The boss crushed everything on the floor.

The crowd dissipated

Dissipate?

The crowd left

Who are you calling? James

Did not call anyone.

Who's he talking to?

Symmetry

I do not know if it's so real.

I thought it would be worse.

In my life, my life.

Never was...

Such humiliation

This is the thing you do not want to say.

And now I'm constantly squatting

What happened? James

Like tonight?

Can you hear? James
Sure I Can Hear

I think this seems to be broken.

The phone is not bad, James.

Try to focus on it and focus on your work.

All I can do is listen.

Do not feel so slow, do not be so slow

I want to write.

Never enough

It's really impressive, this weapon...

No witness testimony This
is really scaring me.

Yes, that's not exactly my choice.

Scared me, if I try?

Hey, Jason, I got to see you again.

I will contact him at the time and place.

One person, without weapons, without support

They can come closer I'll be
a little bit farther away.

That's how I handle things.

Too late

Look, my girlfriend is so troublesome.

Resist me, you know what I'm thinking?

I think we can get along.

I do not know who you are.

I do not know you at all.

Who are you

"At point A, you're somebody.
I do not know you.

"Listen, do not tell vampires.
"At point B, you're somebody else.

This is getting on well with me...

The oldest person
ever - at point C

Vampire

Another level, angle, fragment, field, area

James?

James?
(I.e.

What happened? Are you alright?

God.

"Is it enough to pull
today?" James - right

Dressed like a man, Catherine

I know it's her, but it's a bit confusing.

Let me help you with your hair, okay?
I'll help you comb your hair.

Why do you look so worried?

It's me.

Quick, James, ask her.
You know it's Catherine.

It's hidden somewhere in there, right?

Must be com...

It does not matter -
related to your ear

My ears?

Which ear?

your right ear -
your right ear?

What happened to my right ear?

I do not know, but it caught my interest.

When it started?

For a while but I do not want to tell you

Do you know...
James

"It's too long today."
"It is not her ears that confuse you.

You must know how my ears are not

Not her ear.

Okay, you have the final say.

Your ears are nothing, James.

Come and feel

Feel this ear, right ear, James

Left ear

The same

Symmetry

Hey look

Wait a minute, hello?

Hello

Look, I hear the phone with my ears.
No problem

Yes

Please wait a moment.

I want to meet you.

Good

I'll be back soon, listen.

Something that does not exist
somewhere Later it existed again

Early

(I.e.
How are you doing?

What do you think?
I'm busy with these.

Quick, I've been doing this all night.

Good Morning

Can you go to other smoking rooms?

You can

When did you start pumping?

Occasionally

This is not the answer. When did I ask you to start?

I'm not asking how often do you get it?

I just smoked in other rooms.

OK forget it.

Do you like it? These are...

These are psychiatrists in
the 50's Inkblot test drawn

I think these pictures are very good.

It is?
Yes.

Thank you

You know, I always thought

And I have an idea to tell you

Really

Think, think about this photo, you have an idea.

I'm thinking, hey, about my book.

So what?
"You know about my job.

How much effort was paid

How much time was invested?

Three hours there, eight hours there.

Ten o'clock here, you know, it's crazy.

Right. It's crazy.

Yes.
then...

If I put my text and your painting...

It's art, right? Not only...

My work plus your
work All this is art

Art, art, all fictitious

All of nothing

You know I mean, fictitious

So... it's there.

Really like

Nothing, nothing

Yes, yes, I mean that.

Because it's like something that does not exist somewhere.

Later there was again The main
character of the white whale

One day, many days, there were no white whales at the time.

Without white whales, then scream

The white whale appeared Yes.

There is and will always be

But one day the white whale disappeared suddenly.

Yes, but you just mentioned

Equivalent to a Heavy Load, James

Do not we have a picture like that?

Is there such a painting in your house?

Yes, similar

Great

This requires an artist
Created by the artist

Yes.
Everything needs to be created

You need to trust someone's hands.

We've known each other a long time, right?

Right - We are very
familiar with each other

Know each other's creations, trust each other

Yes

It is?
Yes

Okay, what if I'm dead?

what?
"I'm not saying that kind of death.

I just said, in case, I'm dead.

What if I get out and pressed down the tree?

Or was it hit by a car?

I left the world, but the work is not over yet.

I mean, things are still there.

Completed 75%

Or 80% or 70%

Just put there

No one will finish more, it is a semi-finished product.

70% completed - Completed 70%

You are crazy?

No

Hi everybody, where did the people go?

James

We're here, hey, Delmar

Good morning, the bell does not ring.

excuse me

Not so asked, but...

Can you lend me some sugar? I'm baking bread

Catherine - Of course...

What is it?
"Is not the work over yet?"

Ok - So, when I
go back west...

You should do this first.

Okay. This is what I want to tell you.

Back to the West?

my God.
Then...

I'm so glad you're here, Delmar.

Please, sit down.

We are discussing something very important.

I suggest Catherine make an appointment with me.

Oh, that's...

A secret agreement - No,
this is not a secret.

It's a simple arrangement.
Then I'm back in the West.

I hope you have finished my book.

If you die first, I'll help you complete the paintings and sculptures.

"Okay, James, are you really talking?"
Of course

"Have you heard of this agreement?"
I will meet

Just for safety

Know that after evaporating

The work can still be completed
It will make me feel better

This is really interesting.

Thank you, Delmar.
It's all right.

So, how do we sign up?

Are you... going to leave a message for me?

Do you want the book to be published?

Which of the author's photos should I put?

The details are pretty

It's really very

In fact, it's not that complicated.

I'll be at work...
very good

Leave some words, okay?

As for the author's photo, it's no big deal.

I mean...

I still use your pictures, I do not care.

I do not even think about it, my picture.

I think about it.

What should I do?

Should I put my hair up?

Still down?
I should have been sitting in danger...

Or if you have nothing to sit on?

The author's photo is not the essence of the job, okay?

"It's not the kind of agreement you want.
OK.

not related to the author's photo
Catherine

As?
If i am you

I'm going to comb my hair to the side.

Yes, yes, that would be...

So you can be in your ear...

Connect a flower and wear a headscarf

The handkerchief looks beautiful.
The two suggestions are great

Do not worry, just point it, okay?

OK

OK

This project is incredible, but James.

You really think too much.

A rich and healthy life is waiting for you ahead.

Catherine - What is this?

If I were you, I'd take a picture like that.

OK

Patricia?

It does not matter which author photo

You know, your face.

No matter what angle is a good photo

After all, you're an actor, James.

I used to be an actor.

I'm not an actor anymore.
I am now a writer, Delmar.

I do not act, I write an article.
OK

"Take this, Delma.
OK

I think I should get out.

I just got in and got some sugar.

"I have the sugar I want."
Take it.

Thank you, Catherine.

You are welcome to come and sit at any time.

Thank you

Goodbye, you beautiful student.

Thank you.
toasted bread gently

Hey, Delmar

You can bake and pick it up again.
James

I have absolute confidence in you.

You can complete your own novel

So?

You know This deal can be beneficial to me.

Although I have not drawn up any plans to die

However, you can definitely interpret an image

For example, look at this photo and tell me

What do you see

Is it a wall and a floor?

It's the wall and the floor.

I actually thought so when I was drawing last night.

Very observant

What I saw was the ink on the paper.

You have to admire her.

This is the ink on the paper.

Very good, Patricia

Hey, how about taking a ride?

Get out of this room?

Okay, I want to go.

"Patricia, what about you?"
do not do

Only you

I'll find Delmar.

Delmar

I'm coming to you to go to our house to eat apple pie.

Come in, James, come in quickly.

Log in

Patricia

God

How are you doing?
Not bad

What are you doing?

I'm going to a soap opera that's broadcasting you.

No, I'm not watching.

I mean, since you left

"I do not watch anymore.
Does not matter

Anything

You should...
You can watch

Hey, you should watch

I mean, this is a good show.

Even without my participation

Does not matter

Is that a replay? It seems to be a long time ago

This station is often broadcast in the middle of the night.

And often not in order

If you are not the number one fan

I do not understand what the show is doing.

There is no reason for this.

This is a novel, it is telling stories.

Why do you still want...
I know

Look at the old one?
I know

I've seen every episode before you get fired.

Leave, I quit.

Yes, that's what I mean.

At that time, you quit the game.

That's right.

Hey, you want to... eat some apple pies?

Catherine just shopped with me.

I'm going to be a party and I want to invite you into the past.

That's great.
OK

Okay, let me get you a shawl.

Just next

I killed a man in Tribeca.

Watching him die

I do not have a bad feeling.

I turned into art

Never stopped

People do not understand how sensitive others are.
Never stopped

People do not understand how sensitive others are.

People do not understand how sensitive others are.
Yeah, I got home last night.

Enter the restaurant and open the chandelier.

There's a picture of my inkblot on the wall.

She is scrawled up

what?
Is so

She has a meaningless doodle.

And this is a photo that I really like.

I originally wanted to get him.
Was ruined by her

You know, I've been...

Use a new stationery in the study

For my writing

It is? What is it?

Do you know how much I love using ink pens?

Three cups of coffee, thank you.

I know

Signature pen and microphone pen

Uh

I started... using... pencils

You do not hate pencils.

Yes I know

I still have an ink pen in use.

But the pencil can do this without the ink pen.

First of all, your ink will not run out

Secondly, your punches are very good.

The pencil is so interesting that I tried to use it.

"You know, physical
effort." "That's right.

You can feel the touch

I really feel that work efficiency has improved.

Real work, have fun and...

Better yet, if you made a mistake

Can be canceled with a rubber

The only remaining crumbs of rubber

"Strange things happened.
"I do not know what it would be like.

While it explodes, it's gone.

So the whole piece of paper is brand new.

"You can start from scratch
too." "That's right.

So the pencil is really god.

Curiously

Yes, efficiency artifact

Right? I really do not understand why you...

I always love simplifying, James

Why do not you use an ink pen?

Have you passed? Just use an ink pen

Right

Right James?

I'll continue to use the ink pen.
I went to the bathroom.

Why do you scrawl my paintings?

I like it.
What do you like?

Do you like my painting or do you like to destroy it?

I did not hurt, I was painting.
I added the painting

If you are so interested in art

Glad to provide you with ink and paper.

How do you want to practice?

But you should not practice on other people's paintings.

Whether you know it or not

Your behavior is really provocative.

I just told Patricia.

She should not destroy my paintings

I will not say that she is "doing destruction"

Are not you going to tell?

What do you say? This is my job

If it spoils your article

You'll be furious, James.

I know, I'm not breastfeeding her.

I just said...

Patricia is like this

What you spoil is a painting that I like very much.

Hey, you just said you're using a new piece of paper.

a new design role -
No, I did not say that.

I said I'm using a different color of paper.

(I.e.

Just a different color of paper

It's a creamy tone

grayish Yes.

I'm also starting to draw the character

Better than standing up You
can not find it at all.

Ah, that's the way it is.

I was thinking... maybe you did not draw well.

Because it seems... a
little Not very positive

My character is not correct?

Oh my God

Do you know Catherine?

Sometimes you dress like a man.

I'm confused. I know, James.

I know sometimes you'll be confused about what's in front of you.

But it's me

Whenever I see you dressed as a man
You will feel very much like costumes

It looks very pretentious.
Is that it?

Looks like a fantasy, very fake

The garrison does not apply here, Patricia

You are here...
you should not use that word

Patricia, how do you say that?

I do not know, I'm just Not
yet accustomed to her dress

So whenever I wear this dress
Do you think I'm such a clown?

Did you think so in your heart?

You seem to be wearing a costume.

Okay, God.

It's really a lot of speculation tonight, right?

Honestly, this is really hurting feelings.

Patricia, I do my best to take care of your brother.

Taking care of him because he cares for him

I have to try my best to care about you.

"I have to take care of you."
Catherine

I'll do it because I care about your brother.
My good friend

And when you sit here, it makes me feel uncomfortable.

I mean, if I want to leave home

Dress like a half-tone man with a beard

I have a good performance

These are not difficult, I can do that.

But the person who questioned me is actually...

It's too much for you to live with me under one roof.

It's hurting a lot.
Catherine

It's all because of your mental illness, I mean...

If you have a mental illness, you will forget.

Acceptable, at least true
And what is my calculation?

I'm pretentious, but a clown.

It's simply a buzzword.

I do not know what I'm talking about.

I am not mentally ill, there is no such thing.

I'm just a person who wants to dress like a man.

It is

excuse me

As?
That's... Mr.

Can you turn down the volume?
You scared my baby.

Your baby is also scared.
You should be whispering.

This is a place for family gatherings.

There is a group of perverted places to expose each other

I'll give you a suggestion, sir, sit down.

Really disgusting, transsexual

Do not let your tears fall

I have an old neighbor

He is always a woman at age 65.

He has long gray hair
Wearing strange glasses

I always love wearing a skirt, stepping on high heels

But he's obviously a man, obviously

Do you remember our neighbor? Patricia

That man?
remember if

What are you doing now? James

I do not know, I just remembered him coming.

Our neighbor is very strong

This old man in disguise

I mean, let go.

He's ready to fight for a long time.

I used to think he should be...

The strongest and most powerful person in the world

Very strong, got it?

Dressed like a woman in a community like that at the time

What is needed is unparalleled determination and perseverance

I used to track him.

Just watching him

People see the reaction of their walk

I'm sorry to ruin your paintings, Catherine.

Her neighbor, the "woman"

Have you talked to him yet? James

No, I hope to have

Only people are very sensitive

You know, people do not understand.

Others do not understand how sensitive people are.

They just do not understand

So I have to be arrogant to others.

Who are you talking about?

Anyone can

get up

Let's go home.
Come on, James.

Come on, Patricia.

After all, you have experienced your own life.

(I.e.

Hello Delmar

What are you doing?
Anything.

I just want to come and say hello.

A person feels a little alone at home, you know

Right

What are you busy with? James

"Are you writing your book?"
Yes.

Hey, you're very talented.

When can I read your masterpiece?

To be honest, I'm fed up with fear.

I look forward to nothing more than a book...

Autographed printed book only

The first will be left for you.

Do you mind if I sit next to you?

With you?

"Do not worry, please, sit down.
very good

Very good

I have a crossword puzzle to come

I always carry this with me.

Who knows when inspiration will appear

Six letters, meaning not here

Absent

Away, you know? Do you know...

Where is this house attractive?

Hey you two

You and Catherine have chosen a creative life.

This is really...

Honestly, she's drawing here.

You can play in your novels

Right

It's a very new thing for me.

I've always been a bit jealous of the two of you.

And the decisions you made for yourself

About this creative life

But the world is different now.

The world is full of vitality

Open and so wonderful

If I have the chance to start over, start over.

I dare say I will definitely...

Developing for the act
of acting Like you

I really want to have the opportunity to try and act and tell stories.

You know, temporarily withdrawing

You know, the world is not seen in appearance.
So open and vibrant

You should know, Delmar

Especially after you have tried your life.

I know

Six letters, meaning discomfort

Disease

-Delma - Catherine.

How are you doing?
very good

I'm very happy to see you playing crossword puzzles.

Yes, how are you?
very good

I'm well thanks.
That's great.

What did you buy?

Drawing

I have conceived new creations in my mind.

I can not wait to start painting.

I still have many pictures to complete.

Speculate according to the contract we just signed

I should die in my sleep tonight.

"I have no problem."
Great.

"How are you writing?"
proceeding smoothly

It is? Great

Well, you recently...

Hey Patricia, how are
you doing recently?

Honey, you should not smoke.

She is smoking in the bedroom.

Patricia

Patricia, what are you doing?

James

Come on

I saw you

I saw you, call

Meng Ma - Mammoth

Snow covered pavement

Bum animal

Tree

Heavy ice

unsupervised - Meng Ma

One Person - Whales
in Motion, Snow

Telephone and...
snow

sea breeze

Snow

Wow, who is this?

God, is she blind?

Your fingers move line by line

It can be so fast, it reads line by line.

I want to take a picture.

No.
It does not matter, it does not matter.

I know you are there.

"Sorry to bother you.
"Is there something?"

I just want to take a photo.

What are you filming?

Your hand

Your hand slides across the page

I've never seen a bit of reading before.

It is?

Yes, how did you do it?

Oh, it's not that difficult.

This is just one of many things blind people need to learn.

How to read by hand?

This book is all points

Come and feel

Can I sit by your side?

Of course, sit down.

Sitting alone in the cold wind seems very lonely

"No, I do not feel alone.
do not feel lonely

I like the sound of seawater.

I like the sound of waves.

Stray animals and waves

Thanks for talking to me.

You are welcome

I am leaving now.
OK

(I.e.
Goodbye.

I want to finish my romance with Braille.

what?
Yes it's right.

I want to learn how to read and write words.

Why are you doing this?

what?
Why are you doing this?

Let me see things from different angles

Useful for my writing

Help me think more...

What else?
abstract

You Do not Need Abstract Thinking, James

You do not really need

No, how do you know how to learn words?

I think it's hard to go to heaven.

Almost impossible task

Listen - I mean, definitely...

listen

Do you know what that means?
what?

Do you know what it means to learn Braille?

This means that you are not sure what you want to do

It is

It means on the road to write books

You're divided again, James

"This is not a distraction.
That is

That means listening, I'll say

That means you have to learn some words, Catherine.

What?

Wake up

What are you talking about?
Great.

Did you forget so soon? This nomination

If I'm dead...

God.
You must complete my creation

If you die, I'll finish your work.

I do not want to learn words, I do not want to learn.

Listen, I'm listening.

You promised, we agreed
To complete my work

The efforts of my life

I wish you good luck.

I really do not understand.

Why do people with normal vision force themselves?

Go learn what words

I do not know where to find someone who knows the word.

In fact, I do not know a blind person.

I know - The best is

The woman I met on the beach

She is jealous, she can not see anything.

So what?
Then I do not know...

What are you doing?
But that's what I'm doing.

OK

There's not even a mark, right?

Dotted paper only

Dial the sound from the microphone

It's James's favorite

However, he encountered difficulties tonight.

Something complicated

Pick up the microphone and dial the

Not an easy task

At point A, you are someone At
point B, you are someone else.

At point C, you become...

I'll be back soon

Is it necessary to be so excited? James

We are all here, you are very excited

"I'm not excited.
excited to go crazy

I just tried to get the job done.

Wait

James is above he is screaming

Who is James?
"James is my brother.

I can hear you.

I can hear you talking, Patricia.

Is anyone else up?

Does he have a gun? Does he have any alcohol?

He drank lots of water.

I can hear other sounds.

I'm not crazy, I'm not sick.

Do not bother me, I want to do anything.

I want to read anything.

I can do this, I'm doing what I want to do.

I can stay here.

This table does not have to be here.

Waiting is a good idea.

If you can take a while

Inciting people usually become better controlled

Patricia, who's this voice?

Is it Catherine? Where did she go?

The reason James is crazy is unknown.

But he is absolutely full of anxiety.

James, let me in...

"Talk to you, James.
no

Said on the other side of the door

I hear you have some problems.

I'm coming to help you.

I do not need your help.

I'm just writing a book here.

James, I'm coming to help you.

Does not bother me

Anybody there?
Frankenstein

James?

Catherine

Patricia - Is that right?

He 's Delmar.
Patricia, what happened?

How could this be?

Lord, please be quiet.
We want James...

"Calm down for a while."
James is inside?

Hey, God.

I can hear you outside the door.

James? We have three people

I'm James, too.
There are five people outside.

Sir, please.
Sir, please be quiet.

There are three people outside, James

We want to help, let's go in and help you

Okay, we have to act.

The police are ready to enter the room

Procrastination is still part of the plan.

Maybe they can win James' trust.

Avoid causing physical conflicts

I do not think I need to use sticks.

(I.e.
Mr.

James, let's go in and talk to you.

James

Throw it away - What
are you doing behind it?

Hear Me Now

We're coming...
Leave and talk to us

Take the light.
We're here to help you.

Move quickly, hurry up.
We're here to help you.

will not hurt you - turn
off, turn off the light

James, listen to me, we...

I did not promise you to come in, this is my place.

Get out - do not

Get out and talk

No reason to be so angry, James.

How do you get to the point where you are now?

Okay, James.

What are you going to do with that microphone?

I want you to put the microphone down, okay?

You bastard, I want to ruin them.

We're here to protect you.

They want to ruin me.

I have to ruin them, and I have to start first.

Go get the cushion and go

You have to try to calm down.

Patricia and Delmar

I'm worried about you.
James, hang up the phone.

James, let it go, let it go

Lower the phone

We can be friends, I'll protect you.

I want this phone.
"I want to be your friend, James.

I wanna be yours...

James, relax.
James

"Relax, James.
Do not touch me.

It's all right.
James

Do not touch me, you still play

James, relax

James is full of anxiety

He's confused.
Relax

I am here.
"Ladies, you can not come in."

I'm here, James.
turned around

Even so, he feels pain like we do.

Do not touch me.
Relax

James's resistance is caused by muscle spasms

Frightened and scared as he

The more pain he has, the more he fights.

Today, the hand and voice of the police

And his calm rhythm
Helping James

Make the most of the damage

I can hear you.

I can hear you.

Do not worry, James, it will be better.

James?

They got out

Hey, James, I'm here.

James - You

You angry gay

Let's go.
James

I'll go with you.
gay

James

Gay gay

James, I'm with you.

Calm down, my God.

Oh, my God, James?

Sometimes people choose to accept

Sometimes people choose to leave

Everything needs to be created You
need to trust someone's hands

At the time I was sitting on the
wall I'm sitting on the floor

I sat on the floor and listened

All I can do is listen.

I do not feel so slow

I've never been, this is humiliated

I've never been humiliated in this life.

My life

I have trouble calming down to work.
Things are not organized in order.

You have to sit down and tidy them up nicely.

I just want to think a lot

Write down the whole brain idea

Drawing, painting, writing

Thoughtful, full of ideas

Patricia.
Catherine.

One day, many days, there were no white whales at the time.

So hit, there is

And there will always be

This requires an artist
Everything needs to be created

You need to trust someone's hands.

It's like a heavy burden, right?

Yes

I tried not to think so, James.

This can not be thought of, it is very fragile

Yes, it is so fragile.

So I need to make a contract

An agreement

Let's go home.

Let's go.
OK

Listen, we like each other, right?

Right

We met a long time ago.

Yes

We understand each other's creations.
Yes, James.

And we trust each other.

Yes

The most difficult balance is with yourself

Right?

I can only see his head.

I know his face has white makeup.

But I can not see

Because I can only see his head.

Hey, what do you want to do?

He's just an avatar, do not listen to him.

He's just an avatar

There is no such thing as discomfort at all.
Some are just that

Then this

These are

It is

Just positive thinking

Now we only have "up" in our conversation.

I slowly go back

Slowly, very slowly

Until my back touches the wall

About ten minutes, right, ten minutes

No, it's ten minutes.

Like the button you pressed the walkie-talkie

Waiting to hear who's there

It is

I chose a pie chart.

Turn on the radio

This is the tail of a whale.

I do not know how real it is.

Sometimes I wake up and I like to talk to myself.

I like the sound coming from the microphone.
