Excuse me.

Shithead.

You shouldn't be here.

I know. Ask for
at least $1,000, okay?

I'll get as much
as I can. You hide.

His wife took his kid
and a couple of million...

and we won't
get a thousand.

Shut up
and stay hidden.

I told him
I was coming alone.

Hey, Mr. Crisp.

How's it going?

You said you had information
about my family.

Yeah, yeah, I do.

Well, let's have it.

Well, it's going to cost you.

Like $1,000?

Okay, that's obviously
not my final offer.

750 would be fine.

I mean, more than fine.

Just tell me what
you have, Danny...

and I'll take
good care of you.

Okay.

That sounds fair.

I was doing a delivery
for Corky last week

out of state...

and I ran into your ex.

How'd she look?

She looked great,
Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

She changed her hair
and stuff...

but she looked like
a million dollars.

In fact, she looked like
about $3 million.

Did she see you?

No. I was
changing a tire...

and suddenly, there she was
across the street...

taking her kid
into this school.

My boy?

Looked great.

He looked very healthy.

It's a real nice, healthy place
where they're living.

It snows in winter there.

Danny...

where are they?

At the school
where I saw them...

Astoria Elementary School.

That's...

It's in Astoria, Oregon.

All right.

Did you tell
anyone else this?

No.

No way.

Hey, I'm not stupid,
Mr. Crisp.

You're not?

Danny.

Danny! No!

Danny!

Danny!

Get up!

Don't you die on me!

I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him.

Was it Crisp?

I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

What are you doing?

Hey, hey, hey!

Stop it! Don't do that!

Don't go anywhere.

Let me go!

No! Let me off of him!

I don't like
what you've done.

I really don't like it.

It feels terrible,
and it looks dreadful.

I'm trying my best.

Maybe your best
isn't good enough.

I'm back.

Oh, great.
Well, that was fast.

It was easy.

I have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, Mother.

Oh, you always
exaggerate, Cullen.

Everything is always
great, terrific.

So, what's so great?

I just found out
where they're hiding.

Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

Oh, how could I
say no to you?

Tell me.

What's happened?

Just let me
handle this myself, Mother.

I know what I'm doing.

Everything is under control.

It's all right.
I'm a police officer.

Crisp, you're under arrest.

Put your hands on your head

and get up!

Kimble, not again!

Your hands!

They're up.

When will you
leave me alone?

Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

Hey, I'm a police officer.

This is an arrest.

This man's crazy.
Look at him.

He'll kill me.
You're just going to stand there?

Freeze!

I'm a cop!

I'm Detective John Kimble.

This man is under arrest.

I'm checking.

You can't just walk in here

and put a gun in my face.

I'm trying to get a manicure.

I have witnesses.

I have a witness, too.

It's murder one this time.

Now you're mine.

The bastard handcuffed me
to a dead man!

A dead man!

Come on. Sit down.

Now, did Danny ever say

what Crisp's wife looked like?

No.

Did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

He didn't say anything.

Look, I just
want to go home.

After the lineup,
I'll drive you home.

I'll even buy you dinner.

I'll even cook you dinner.

I'm not doing any lineup...

and there ain't jack shit
you can do about it!

I've been after Crisp
for four years...

and she's letting
my key witness walk away?

Kimble, sit down!

Sit down.

Sit.
Sit.

Now listen to me.

He killed your boyfriend.

All you have to do
is point your finger...

and we can put him away
for 30 years.

He wasn't my boyfriend.
I hardly knew the guy.

I know you're in there.

I know what you want,
but you ain't getting it.

No lineup, no testimony.

So shove your handcuffs
up your ass!

Now let me out of here!

Slow down!

Open it and let me out!

O'Hara, meet Kimble.

Kimble's been on this
a long time.

Hi.

Let me take care of Cindy.

She'll make Crisp.
I guarantee it.

What are you going to do...

handcuff her to your car

and take her for a ride?

I'm not going to offer
to cook her dinner.

Kimble, hold on a second. L...

Difficult man.
Got to get to know him.

Oh, I can't wait.

Hey, baby.

What you mean, "Hey, baby"?

¿Dónde vas?

Shit!

Oh, excuse me.

I forgot to introduce myself.

My name is John Kimble...

and I love my car.

I'll keep an eye
on it for you.

You got a beautiful ride.

Shit. Who does
he think he is?

He's lucky I didn't
kick his ass.

Open up.

You can't come in.

Thank you.

What the fuck?

All right...

party's over.

Everyone go home.

Next time, my place.

So who are you, man?

Shit!

I'm the party-pooper.

Hi, Cindy.

Do you mind if I sit down?

No.

Sit down, man.

Oh, it's so nice
to see you again.

What are you doing here,
you asshole?

Cindy, I don't like you
using foul language...

not a classy girl
like you.

Don't you have
anything better to do?

You don't understand.

I have nothing else to do...

and I have nowhere else to go.

Why are you staring
at me like that?

I like you, Cindy.

I'm going to be
around you a lot...

days, nights,
weekends, holidays.

No.

No, you can't.

Yes, I can.

I'm going to
hang out with you

until the end of time.

All right, move it in. Let's go.

Step onto the numbers.

Face front.

Everybody, hands to your side.

That's the creep.

Who?

Number five.

That's him.

Good.

Very good.

Mr. Crisp, you will be
remanded into custody

until your trial.

Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

Shh. Don't say anything.

Just take it easy.

I'll take care of it.
Trust me.

You know what to do?

I'm your mother, aren't I?

Mind if I talk
to my friend a little bit?

I'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer.

He's right in here.

You give me the names

of your drug suppliers
and distributors...

and I'll tell the judge

what a nice, cooperative killer
you are.

You think the jury's
going to convict me

on the testimony
of that junkie?

You could be right.

But what about your wife?

You remember her?

All that hard-earned drug money

she stole from you?

How much was it...

$3 million?

I bet she would make
a much better witness.

Kimble, you've wasted years
chasing after me...

and what has it
gotten you, hmm?

Nothing.

I'll be out in a week...

and you'll still be
eating take-out food

in that dump you live in.

Yeah, I know all
about you, Kimble.

Without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.

My old lady left
'cause of the money.

Yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.

I've never seen anyone
so little

eat so much.

Yeah, I know.
I'm hypoglycemic.

If I don't eat regularly...

I get a little nuts.

So... where you from?

Austria.

How long you been a cop?

I been a cop for 12 years.

My father was a cop...

my brother was a cop...

my mother was a cop's wife.

And I have no hobbies.

You two are booked on the first
flight to Portland tomorrow.

Locate Crisp's wife
and offer her immunity

in exchange for
her testimony against him.

No offense to O'Hallahan...

but this is my case,
and I work alone.

He works alone.

Not anymore.

She's going in undercover

as a substitute
kindergarten teacher.

Not exactly a job for you.

I used to be a teacher.

We'll be fine.

What do I do?

She locates the kid...

you find the mother
and the cash...

and Crisp spends his life
making license plates.

Bon voyage.

Oh, and, Kimble,
the name's O'Hara.

OK. Here's the wife at 17.

Real name's Rachel Myatt.

She's from Hannibal, Missouri,
class of '76.

Cheerleader, first violin

in the school orchestra...

captain of the girls'
softball team.

Her ambition was "To travel...

experience life...

and meet interesting people."

Like Crisp.

Okay.

Relax.

Don't let him get to you.

That's her 10 years later.

It's a great shot of an ear.

You get in touch
with her parents?

They're both dead.

The only relative
she's got left is the kid.

Hey.

Okay. This is the only picture
we have of him.

Cullen Jr., aged 3 months.

That helps much.

It's the best I could do.

Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

Please.

No. No, no.

That's a first.

Listen, I was
just thinking.

Maybe we should
take a wild stab

at getting to know each other

before we have to pretend
we're married.

What do you want to know?

How long have we been married?

A long time.

People won't expect us
to talk much to each other.

I want to read it, too.

Stop it.

Please?

Let me take a look.

Hey, come here.

If you don't stop
screwing around back there...

this is what
I'll do with you.

Ohh.

What's the matter?

I don't know.

I just don't feel so good.

You hungry?

I got to get out
of here right now.

Get those tree stumps
out of my way

before I vomit all over them.

Is your wife okay, sir?

Compared to what?

Maybe it was the burrito.

Or it could've been the sausages.

I don't think it was
the crab salad.

It couldn't
have been the doughnuts.

Excuse me.

Oh, I hate feeling like this.

I hate it, too.

Uh-oh.

Uh-oh what?

Uh-oh...

pull over.

Now?

Yeah. Please hurry.

The key!

Give me the key!

Do you need a hand?

You okay?

I'm fine.

I'll be fine.

Class starts
at 9:00 in the morning.

I'll be fine.

You look much better already.

Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

That's why I quit teaching,
you know.

I got so sick
of other people's kids.

I was afraid that
I'd never want to have any

of my own.

I have a son.

He's 13.

I remember
when he was 5.

He lives with his mother
and stepfather.

Aah!

What's the matter?

What...

is...

that?

Oh, excuse me.
I forgot to tell you.

This is my ferret.

He doesn't bite.
Don't worry.

Come on.
Come on out.

This is all I need...
an obstacle.

A goddamn obstacle.

He sends me an obstacle.

Here.

Oh, God.

Don't worry.

I'm going to make it.

I just need a minute.

I'll be ready
in just a minute.

I just got...

Oh, God.

How do I look?

Take off the gun.

That's a good idea.

The little bastards
are going to eat you alive.

Get some rest,
and don't worry.

I've been working undercover
for a long time.

They're 6-year-olds.

How much trouble
can they be?

On second thought...

take the gun.

Matthew...

I sent you to
the principal's office

because you punched Jenny.

I know. She poisoned
your hamsters.

She told me all about it...

and she's very sorry.

And I'm sorry that
I didn't believe you.

But you shouldn't punch people.
But she...

Mr. Kimble, Miss Schlowski
will see you now.

Let's go back to class.

Can I help you?

I'm John Kimble,
your new kindergarten teacher.

We were expecting
a Miss O'Hara.

There's been
a change of plan.

Four weeks into
the new semester...

my superintendent told me
I had to replace Mrs. Hagley...

a kindergarten teacher
of 25 years' experience...

with an undercover
police officer...

and he wouldn't even tell me why.

I don't suppose you
would do me the courtesy

of filling me in.

I can't do that.

Oh.

You can't do that.

I'm watching you.

All I have to do
is tell my parents

that you're
with the police...

and they'll yank their kids

out of this school so fast...

we'd have to close.

And don't you think I won't

if I feel my children
are in any danger.

They're not in danger.

I assume you have
some teaching experience.

They wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

Just wait here a minute.

Everybody sit down
on the carpet!

Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, Miss Schlowski.

Your teacher, Mrs. Hagley

had to go on
an important trip.

Where'd she go?

That doesn't matter.

Did she die?

No, Lowell.
She went to see someone.

Did they die?

No, Lowell.

Everyone dies, you know.

I know, but not
for a long, long time.

Now, until Mrs. Hagley
comes back...

we have someone special to help.

This is Mr. Kimble...

your new kindergarten teacher.

Now, let's everybody say,
"Good morning, Mr. Kimble."

Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

Good morning.

They're all yours.

I'll be watching you.

Hi.

How are you?

I'm very happy to be here.

First I would like
to just get to know you.

Quiet.

I'm going to ask you
a bunch of questions.

I want to have them
answered immediately.

How many of you
were born in Astoria?

Raise your hands.
Let's see them.

Okay, hmm.

Now, anyone that was not
born in Astoria...

somewhere outside
like California...

raise your hands.

Yes.

I need to go
to the bathroom.

Okay. You can go.

Boys have a penis.

Girls have a vagina.

Thanks for the tip.

Yes?

I need to go
to the bathroom...

and I can't get
these things off.

I'll get someone
to help you.

I'll be right back, okay?

You've learned that
the "e" is often silent

when it immediately
follows another vowel.

Now write and say
these words...

Oh, um...

class, uh, Catherine...

can you take over
for me, please?

Thank you.

"E" is the fifth letter
of the alphabet.

Yes, can I help you?

I have a problem.

Mr. Kimble...

I need to go real bad.

First day?

Yes.

I'll take care of her.

Thank you.

You know, kindergarten
is like the ocean.

Don't turn your back on it.

They're okay.

Don't worry.

Everything is under control.

No.

Monsters.

What are you doing with this?

Aren't you going
to break it up?

No. Two more days of this...

and he'll quit.

Shut up!

Shut up! Shut up!

Shut up.

No.

Don't start this.

Aah!

Attention!

This is your new class mascot.

What happened to your dog?

This is not a dog.

This is a ferret.

What's a ferret?

That's a ferret.

Oh!

If he bites you,
you get rabies and die.

No. That's not true.

He never bites.

Can I pet him?

Sure, but one at a time, okay?

Good. Okay, next one.
Come on.

Yes.

Good.

Yeah.

Good. Now we're having fun.

What's that
supposed to mean?

Mrs. Hagley
is a lot better than you.

Is she?

Is she really?

My mom's a teacher
in this school...

and she's a lot better
than you, too.

Great.

On Monday nights,
my mom tutors

and Mrs. Quinn
takes care of me.

She's better than you, too.

Great.

And Frankie,
my swimming teacher...

and Gus, my T-ball coach,
are better than you, too.

I really appreciate
your honesty.

You happen to know someone
that's not better than me?

I don't know
that many people.

John?

Are you there?

How did it go?

Go away.

It went that well, huh?

You take over tomorrow.

And blow our cover?

Can't do it.

They're horrible.

Tell me about it.

He's gay.

What kind of a man
teaches kindergarten?

He's obviously gay.

A male kindergarten teacher
isn't what I'm used to.

Samantha calls him
"The giant."

There he is.

Where, honey?

Holy cow, is that
your new teacher?

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

What are you doing?

I'm not wearing makeup.
None of us are.

You're married.
You're allowed to look like slobs.

Be good. I'll be back
to pick you up.

Good morning,
Mr. Kimble.

Good morning.

I told you he was big.

Play with the kids, honey.

Hi. I'm Jillian,
Sylvester's mom.

Do you have a minute?

I'd like to speak with you.

Sure.

Please.

Thank you.

A male kindergarten teacher.

That's unusual.

You're not from
around here, are you?

No. I'm not.

Neither am I.

Huh.

Anyway...

um...

I have a small problem.

Yes?

You see, Sylvester's father

doesn't live with us anymore...

and I've just been
worried about Sylvester.

He's been acting
a little strange lately...

You know, doing odd things.

Like what?

Well, it seems
that's he's becoming

a little obsessed
with playing with dolls.

You know, it's weird.

I think I can help you
with that.

Really?

He uses the dolls
to look up girls' skirts.

I caught him
doing it yesterday.

Oh. Oh, well,
that's a relief.

But I'll keep
an eye on him, okay?

Thank you.

Does Sylvester
ever see his father?

No. No, not since he was 2.

His father lives in California.

That is far away.

Mm-hmm.

Well, if you give me
his name and number...

I could talk to him

about taking
more interest in his son.

That's very kind,
but I don't think so.

But it's tough on Sylvester,
don't you think?

No.

No, what's tough on Sylvester

is his father left us
for another man.

Are you married,
Mr. Kimble?

No, I'm not.

He's not married, Mom!

Welcome to Astoria...

the single-parent capital
of America.

Thank you for your time.

I pledge allegiance

to the flag

of the United States
of America...

and to the republic

for which it stands...

one nation, under God...

indivisible...

with liberty
and justice for all.

Are these all your lunches?

You mean you eat other
people's lunches?

Stop it!

Now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

We're going to play
a game called...

"Who is my daddy
and what does he do?"

Yes?

Is your daddy a fireman?

He's probably big.
Is he a wrestler?

A basketball coach?

No, no.

What's the matter?

I have a headache.

It might be a tumor.

It's not a tumor!

It's not a tumor at all.

What I meant was...

you tell me who is your daddy

and what does he do?

Oh.

Get it?

We start right here. You.

My dad repairs cars
driven by women who are pinheads.

My dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.

My dad gives money to people
that doesn't have money...

then people use that money...

then they give
other money back

and they give the same amount

of money back to my dad.

My dad doesn't live
with us anymore.

He lives in New York
and drives a taxi.

My mom hopes he's going to die
real soon.

My dad watches TV
all day long.

My dad works on computers...

and he's, um, the boss
of his company...

and, um, he has a mustache
and a beard.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

He doesn't have that
much hair because...

and he...
his head is so big

that he can't wear any hats.

My dad's divorced.

My mom's divorced.

My dad, um,
is a psychologist...

and he helps people
that are hurt

or lost their feelings...

and, um, that's it.

Our mom says that our dad

is a real sex machine.

Good.

I don't know
what my dad does.

I haven't seen him
in a long time.

He lives in France.

My dad is a gynecologist...

and he looks at vaginas
all day long.

Mi papá trabaja
en la casa...

y él juega conmigo mucho.

Thank you.
Very good.

Okay. Next, uh...

What's his name
with his back to me?

His name's Zach Sullivan.

He doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.

He's a poo-poo head.

He's a poo-poo face.

He's a ca-ca poo-poo.

He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

Poo-poo ca-ca!
Poo-poo ca-ca!

Poo-poo ca-ca!
Poo-poo ca-ca!

Quiet.

That's enough.

Hey, Zach.

Did your daddy
teach you this game?

Come on, Zach.
Let's all play together.

It's so much more fun.

Leave me alone!

What's that?

It's a fire alarm!

Come on, come on.

Everyone together!
Come on.

I'm on fire!

Come on. All together!

I'm on fire!

Very straight.
Very straight.

Come on, come on.
Get all together.

Everything together.
Come on.

Come on. Quiet.

Quiet! Come on.

Shh! Quiet.

Well, we're all glad

the kindergarten class
could join us.

That's four minutes.

You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

All the other grades...

your times were an improvement...

but they're still
not good enough.

But they're still
not good enough.

I'm very disappointed.

All right, let's get
back into school.

Mrs. Sullivan!

Mrs. Sullivan!

So the doctor says
it's a stomach flu.

I'm fine. I can
eat anything I want.

Let's find a restaurant.

Can we talk business?

There are 14 boys
in the classroom.

So far I have three possible suspects,
one likely.

Here's a picture.
You listening?

I'm listening.

His name's Zach Sullivan.
What do you think?

He's cute.
Doesn't anybody eat around here?

Listen, he's a dead ringer
for Crisp. Look.

Maybe. Come on, John.
I'm hungry.

A table for two.
Thank you very much.

Two hot dogs.

Two hot dogs?

Mr. Kimble!
Mr. Kimble!

Dominic.

It's him, Mom.

Joyce.

Hello, Joyce.

Dominic has been a great help.

He's a good kid.

Who's that?

Who?

Her.

Oh, that?

Uh, that is, uh...

I am his sister.

Oh, really?

I wouldn't have guessed.

You have to excuse my brother.

He has no manners.

My name is Ursula.
Wonderful to meet you.

I'm visiting here
from Austria.

I'm Joyce Paulmarie.
I work at John's school.

Ah.

And this is Dominic.

Nice to meet you.

Would you like
to join us for dinner?

No.
Ja.

Ja.

Yes, of course.
That would be great.

Hi. There will
be four of us.

Table 27.

Why did you tell her
you were my sister?

Relax, butch.
The love doctor is here.

Come to me.
I want to start.

Okay. I want
a rib eye steak

with mashed potatoes

and a large green salad.

Oh, no.
Wait a minute.

I want to start

with the spicy
chicken wings.

Are they the tiny ones
without meat?

Actually, it's quite
a large serving.

Ah, good.

Ooh, good arms.

And a large bowl
of the clam chowder.

Uh, and the blueberry pie

with ice cream for dessert.

Ja.

I like how they talk.

I've been trying to get to
know the parents...

but some of them
are avoiding me.

Some of them
are like that.

It's a strange town that way...

especially with new arrivals.

What do you mean?

I think a lot of people

that come to small towns

are trying to get
away from something

or they're
hiding something.

Like what?

Well, for example,
what brought you here?

Me? Well,
there was an opening

for a kindergarten teacher.

Yeah, but what made you
become a kindergarten teacher?

I mean, it is a bit unusual.

John is a bit unusual.

Well...

You are.

I was born in Austria.

My father was a teacher.

My mother was a teacher.

So is Ursula.

Ja.

We have a tradition in Austria

where we follow
the footsteps of our parents.

So when I moved
to this country...

I taught geography

and physical education
in Arizona...

and then I coached basketball

at an all-girls school
in Rhode Island, but...

none of it made me
really happy.

Why weren't you happy?

Ja. Why weren't you happy?

Well, I got tired of
teaching teenagers...

because by the time
they came to me...

I felt there wasn't
much I could do with them.

I realized that the real action
is in kindergarten.

How long have you been
teaching kindergarten?

It's my second day.

Oh.

Ooh, excuse me,
but it's good.

It is good.

Thanks again.

Nice to meet you.

Thank you.

Bye.

I had a great time.

Ja, me, too.

Well, Kimble,
I think you scored.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What are you talking about?

I'm only interested in her

because she works
at the school.

She knows the children
and the parents.

If you were any stiffer...

we could take you surfing.

Now, I know you
like that woman.

What is your problem?

The only problem I've got

is that I'm doing your job.

You should be
cleaning up the paint

and reading stories
about bears that go shopping.

I'm stuck with your job.

Yeah. You are.

That's right. I am.

Look, you're going
to be out of here

in a few days.

You told me yourself
you had a few good leads.

You'll be back dealing
with junkies and murderers

in no time.

They're pushing me around.

Who?

The kids.

They're walking all over me.

Listen, Kimble.

You got to handle this

like any other police situation.

You walk into it showing fear...

you're dead...

and those kids know you're scared.

No fear.

No fear.

Today we're going to play
a new fun game.

It's called "police school."

I'm going to be your sheriff.

You're going to be
my deputy trainees.

Come on.

Stop whining.

You kids are soft.

You lack discipline.

Well, I've got news for you.

You are mine now.
You belong to me!

You're not going to have
your mommies here

to wipe your tushies.

Oh, no.

It's time to turn
this mush into muscles.

No more complaining.

No more, "I have to go
to the bathroom."

There is no bathroom!

Now, the first thing the
deputy trainees have to learn

is to freeze
whenever you hear this.

Now, the next time you hear
this whistle...

each one of you get
one toy.

How many?

One!

Good. Then bring it back
to the carpet...

pronto.

Ready?

Wait for it.

Wait for it.

Sit down.

Ready?

Go quickly.

Get your toy.

Go.

Go for it.

Yes. Very fast.

Good. Quickly.

Bring the toy
back to the carpet.

Bring it back
to the carpet.

Quick, quick, quick.

Back to the carpet.

Quickly.

Emma.

Emma...

take your toy
to the carpet.

I'm not a policeman.
I'm a princess.

Take your toy
back to the carpet.

I'm not a policeman!

I'm a princess.

Take it back!

All right.

Very good.

You did very well.

Now we're going to
play another game.

When you hear
two whistle blows...

take your toy back
where you got it

and come right back.

How many whistle blows?

Two!
Two!

Good. Ready?

Go.

Come on.

Come right back
to the carpet.

Yes. It works.

This is great.

Faster, faster.

Come on.

Yes. Come back. Terrific.

This is working. Wait.

I mean, you're
very good deputies.

Your sheriff
is proud of you.

1, 2, 3, 4.

1, 2, 3, 4.

1, 2, 3, 4.

1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait! Take me.

Down. Up. Down.

Yes, yes, yes!

You've got it.

Yes, Wanda. Good.

Very good.

Big circles. Big circles.

Good.

Now do the same thing.
Way back.

And down in big circles.

Big circles.

Yes.

This is a fire drill!

This is a fire drill.

Run to the door.

Dominic, don't forget Ferret.

Yes. It's a fire drill.

Come on.

Oh, this is terrible.

Come on. Come on.

29.

30.

31.

32.

33.

One more.

Come on.
Down and up.

Yes!

Yes!

Zach is the winner.

Come on, you guys.

March, 2, 3, 4.

March, 2, 3, 4.

Swing your arms.

2, 3, 4.

Swing them high.
2, 3, 4.

1, 2, 3, 4.

1, 2, 3, 4.

Wow.

1, 2, 3, 4!

Reading, writing, arithmetic.

Reading, writing, arithmetic!

Too much homework
makes me sick.

Too much homework
makes me sick!

When it's time
to pass the test...

When it's time
to pass the test...

kindergarten is the best.

Kindergarten is the best.

Yay!

E-l-E-l-O

And on that farm
he had a duck

E-l-E-l-O

All right.
Take your milk.

It makes you big and strong.

It's story time, Mr. Kimble.

All right.

We all like this one...

and if you read us a story now...

everybody will go to sleep.

All right.

I used to read this to my son.

What's his name?

Who?

Your son.

Oh, Alex is his name.

Where is he?

He lives with his mother.

You see, his mother and I...

we are...

Divorced. I know.

What's a divorce?

It's when your daddy
lives someplace else

and comes over
to take you places...

and your mommy says
he's a deadbeat.

No. It's when the daddy

doesn't want to see
his little boy anymore.

That's not what it is.

Why don't you want to see
your little boy?

Was he bad?

No, he was not bad.

It wasn't his fault at all.

You see...

his mommy and I,
we just nev...

Just sit down, okay?

Let me just start reading.

Why don't you all lie down?

Okay.

Good. And rest.
