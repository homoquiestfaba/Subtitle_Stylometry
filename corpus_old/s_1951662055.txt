At the end of the century XVlll
and beginnings of the XIX one...

...the Welsh immigrants brought
to America a Celtic old ritual...

...practiced by hundred of years.

The ritual was known as the one
"Devouring of Sins."

Mount Appalachian Mountains, 1830

20 years later.

My town crossed an ocean to live
in the mountains of this new world.

They came with the hope
of beginning a new life.

But we were also a town
with dark secrets...

...that we tried to cover
with an old ritual.

However, the secrets always
they are revealed by the light of the truth.

In that spring, to my ten anuses,
the whole truth was finally revealed.

Pope says that I resemble you, Granny.

You look like each other me, Cadi.

You also have the blue eyes
of your grandfather Ewan...

...and the same thirst in your soul.

Give him/her time to your he/she suckles, Cadi.

Granny that happens?

Not it is anything, love.

If it could formulate a desire now,
do you know which serious?

That the time went back?

That also serious brilliant, don't you believe?

But that that but I want now it is
something of color and beauty.

I return at once.

Baby, Cadi? I love you, my love.

I also love you, Granny.

.Granny, I found them! I found them.

Granny?

No, Granny. Granny.

Gorawen is
hardly some days ago...

...that I listen the powerful voice
calling it from the mountain.

He/she wanted to take a long time a little
for Cadi's good.

Salt of here, Cadi.
If. If, he/she suckles.

Your he/she suckles you I send out?

If, Mister.

It gathers the cedar sticks
and take them to the house.

They moved away the scent to death.

Cadi, you should listen to me, now.

Make that you make,
never go to the Devouring of Sins.

Do you understand me?

He/she has the expression of the hell
in their eyes...

...it has assimilated in if same
horrible habits...

...and if you look at it, their wickedness will relapse
on you.

Do you understand me, Cadi?
If, Mrs..

Very well.

Angor.
Brogan.

I give you spiritual comfort,
Gorawen Forbes...

...so that you don't wander forever
for the roads or mountains...

...or throughout the paths.

And for your earthly sins,
dear woman...

...zeal my own soul.

While he/she listened that man
sad and miserable...

...I wondered for that the one loaded
with the sins of people...

...that they were refused to look at it
to the eyes...

...and I wondered as soon as time
he/she would come to devour my sins.

He/she would have to live until the age of Granny
to liberate me of all my sins?

When I became, the he/she had left...

...and with the my hope left
of being forgiven some day.

Forget the, Cadi Forbes.
It has completed their purpose and he/she has already left.

Now veto to house.

Who the Devouring of Sins is?
To who rots to tell him/her the truth?

Who liberated me of my sins?

Can I help you in something, does he/she suckle?

Cadi, salt and it picks up some sassafras
for your he/she suckles.

If, potato.

When you overcame it
and did you begin to be he/she suckles again, does it Trust?

Please, Angor, leave me calm.
Not I can respond now your questions.

The death of Gorawen...

This doesn't have anything to do with the
my mother's death, and your you know it.

That girl this so affected as your
for what happened to Elen and her...

She needs you.

It hurts a lot.

As much as time will make us suffer?

Not it should have been my small Elen.
Not he/she should have been my baby.

You would want that he/she had been a Cadi
who died?

Is that? It is that what you say.

You would want that he/she had been a Cadi
who died.

Not you should be here, Cadi.

They have noticed you that you stay far.

.Cadi!

Hello, Katrina Anice.

There is a better place
to cross the rapids of Narrows.

Me you that there is him. Who are?

My name is Lilybet.
As it is that you know me?

All in the place of where I come
they have listened that you made.

Do all know?

All know something, Katrina Anice.

But who knows everything?

Follow me. I know the road.
Toward where?

To find the one that can liberate you
of your sins.

The Devouring of Sins?

Where you live?
This far from here, but not so much.

You are a very strange girl.

That place is not good, Cul.
You should prove there.

Do you want to be quiet?
You will frighten my fish.

Not you could fish a cow,
in any event.

Cadi Forbes, you are lucky that me not
have a he/she arms.

It would have shot you taking for Indian.

Leave alone it.
Their grandmother has just died.

I scream exactly when it was to fish...

...one very big.

Not I wanted to get scared, Cul.
Lilybet and me alone we were...

Who Lilybet is?
That girl that this there.

Good, it was there. It should be shy.

They say that not this well of the head...
Already this well, Cul.

That you make in the earth of Kai
in any event?

Not I realized toward where we went.

We walked below river
from the rapids of Narrows.

Your he/she suckles he/she knows
that you were in the rapids of Narrows?

You don't care that.

Are you hungry?

Insurance went for some side.

If, somehow.

Besides driving away my fish?

It was about finding
to the Devouring of Sins.

The Devouring of Sins?

He/she is a monster.

He/she is a demon of lit red eyes
and long wolf eyeteeth.

He/she is a man that sold him/her the soul
to the devil. He/she smells the death.

He/she lives hoping people die...

...to feed with their sins.

If, and he/she suckles he/she says that if he/she looks at you
with their devil eyes...

These dead one.
That is not true.

As you know it?
Good, I am not dead, or if?

Did you look at it, truth?
In the funeral of your grandmother.

Not I could avoid it.
Their voice sounded very sad and solitary.

Now these convict.

He/she prays a lot. He/she prays very much
so that the devil doesn't find you.

It is better than we already return home.
They Come, Glynnis.

I wonder where he/she lives.

Alone he/she comes when somebody plays
the bell of the death.

If somebody knew...

...he/she would have to be somebody but old
that you hoist them.

That you made yourself?
I walked somewhere around. Fagan is very comely.

He/she suckles, I want you to know somebody.

I met a new friend.
Their name is Lilybet.

Now not, Cadi.

This well, Katrina Anice.
Perhaps in another moment.

If. He/she suckles this busy one with their loom.
It will be in another moment.

I go. I already go.

Miz Elda, wondered
who he/she would want him to come to their funeral one.

Sacred God, girl.

That he/she asks for a bigger woman.
I not yet am dead.

Not Mrs.. But it will be very late
to ask him/her when him this.

Well, in that you are right.

And the Devouring of Sins?
Would he like that he/she came, Miz Elda?

Certainly. I will be very needy
of the one.

I have a basket full with sins
to discharge.

And like we will look for it to him?
Not you will have to look for it.

The bell of the death is listened
clearly in these mountains.

He listened to it.

But for that all these questions
on the Devouring of Sins?

Me...

...I need that the he/she helps me.

Turn you, Cadi.

He cannot make anything for you.

That happened in that bridge of the tree
fact this...

...and your you have to live your life with
it.

It is about making the well
from now on...

...and at the alone end you will have a stain.

Also, the one won't come for you
until your I finish sigh.

Then he/she would want to be dead.
In that way everything would have finished.

Be careful with what you want, Cadi.

God can hear you and to take the word.

You takes to my husband,
that not toward but that to complain.

Now, better you retract of that that
you said.

Not Mrs.. Not I can live with that that
I made.

I need to the Devouring of Sins
so that he/she already eats up my sins.

Please, Miz Elda, he/she could tell me
where he/she lives so that I can speak to him/her?

Nina.
Hello?

Just as their dad and their grandfather.

Kai is not happy
unless they are killing something.

Mrs., I brought him/her some fresh meat.
Were you fighting, young Kai?

No, Mrs..

A great idea on your behalf.

But not you that he/she has been put
to the youths of this valley...

...that they bring meat and flowers to one
old.

Squirrel meat?

You believed that we would make it speak
with squirrel meat?

Not believe that not you for that these here,
Cadi Forbes.

Perhaps you know. Perhaps not.

Do you believe that this is a game?

Ask to potato for the Devouring one of
Sins, and I take out myself flying of the porch.

He/she said that if he/she asked him/her again,
it would skin my back.

He/she said that their single mention
the demon attracts to a house...

...neither that to speak of looking at it, as your
you made.

Your you looked at it, truth?

If, Mrs..

In that were thinking?

Not I could avoid it, Miz Elda.
The form in that I speak Granny was.

It was listened very sad.
I speak as if he/she loved her.

And for a good reason.

After your grandfather died...

...your grandmother took an offering to her
it knocks down whenever he/she could.

A bundle of carrots,
half-dozen of ears, some eggs...

...and he/she left them there in their tomb, as
I give, for the Devouring of Sins.

None in this valley
I treat him with so much gracefulness.

Your grandmother if.

It got off the Dead's Montana...

Montana of the Dead?
Montana of the Dead?

That was not what I meant.

It is hour that you two leave.
If, Mrs..

If I find to the Devouring of Sins...

...and he/she eats up my sins,
does he/she suckle he/she forgot?

No, girl. She never forgot.

But perhaps it will be able to forgive.

The Devouring of Sins was
the only reason for which came, Cadi?

If, Mrs..

Next time won't be for that reason.

Who was taken my sins,
Cadi Forbes?

You see that you made.

He/she comes you well.
I hope you have broken the foot.

Were you still?
It is your blame, to spy me.

Not I wanted to get scared, Cadi.
I promise it, if it is not this way that die.

Be careful with what you want.

Will we go to the Dead's Montana or not?

I want to speak to you first.
On that?

It is that I have never seen that my potato
fear anything. Anything.

Except for the Devouring of Sins.

Well, I don't fear him/her
because you that the he/she would not harm me.

Perhaps already he/she harmed you when him
you looked.

Perhaps you didn't realize.

That you say?

First, you cannot take yourself it out of the
head.

He/she suckles he/she says that there are strong spirits
black for these mountains...

...that it is preferable not to bother.

Which spirits?

Perhaps that girl of which you spoke
be not what seems.

Lilybet is not a spirit.
She is my friend.

He/she looks, I sit down that your potato nagged you
for my blame...

...but I will look for to the Devouring of Sins
with you or without you.

He/she waits, I will go with you.

Not you have to make it.
If. I need to protect you.

It should have thousands of places
to hide here.

Perhaps he/she could bring to my old greyhound.
We can make him to leave.

The Devouring of Sins
it is not a rabbit, Fagan.

Eat.
That?

That you say?

You remember that that Miz Elda said
on the gifts that Granny left him/her?

After all maybe if it is
as catching a rabbit.

I have to leave.

It is the sign of Cleet
when potato me this looking for.

But there is even light.

Not I can. Pope would skin me
if it was for here.

Hurry and veto to house, Cadi Forbes.

When you finish fixing,
they come out and it finishes your tasks.

If, he/she suckles.

GORAWEN FORBES
JULIO 31 OF 1781 - JUNE 25 OF 1850

I have to be it to Fagan.

An outsider.

Listen to me when I call you, Mr..

He/she listens my sentence.

Because it is for you and alone for you that
prayer.

You are a God
that he/she doesn't find pleasure in the wickedness...

...and there is wickedness in these mountains.

Where you were?
For that didn't go to the cemetery?

Because my father you this giving bill
that I am lost the whole time.

Good, the wine, Fagan.

The Devouring one came to the tomb
and you takes the preserves that he/she leaves him/her.

Did you speak with the one?

Not exactly.

Let us stay as sleeping.

But you takes my gift. You that he/she made it.

For sure he/she made it.

Now silence. I want to hear the stranger.

.Mama!

For that took this
to the tomb of Granny?

Me...

Not you did think that I would follow you, Cadi?

Always these going to places
to those that you would not should.

Now you are a thief. Also, to steal...

...to your own family!

No, he/she suckles. Me...

You never think before making the things.
For that?

.Fia!

That you have made?

.Angor!

There is an outsider camping
to the foot of the rapids of Narrows.

Kai says that he/she took charge of the one.

Which the danger is when allowing it to stay?

Kai says that this lunatic.

Also, there is not but earth for the one.
Not there is space.

It seems that Kai dictates all the rules
here.

Not speak bad of the, it Trusts.

Brogan and their family have always known
what is good for the valley.

We won't have anything
that to do with that stranger, of agreement?

Cadi?

That it happens, does he/she suckle?

I want to give you this.

This well. Take it.

That you will make with those preserves?

To keep them for the Devouring of Sins.

And if you take them to that lady of those
bees? She maybe knows where the one lives.

Devouring of Sins.

He/she Waits, Devouring of Sins.

.No! Not you should follow it, girl.

Leave me.

Devouring of Sins, he/she waits, please.

Devouring of Sins, he/she waits.
I won't leave until you speak to me.

Please. I need you.

You spoke that woman.
For that don't speak with me?

For that dared to look at myself
in the funeral of your grandmother, Cadi Forbes?

Because I need that you take yourself my
sins.

It is not made in that way.

Veto to house
and don't look for me another time again.

If you don't take yourself now my sins...

...then I will see that you can make it
in a way but appropriate.

Not I can continue living
with this pain inside my.

Not I can live knowing the pain
that I have caused all.

Devouring of Sins?

They come tomorrow.

The woman that you dressed, Bletsung MacLeod,
it showed you the one in route to the mountain.

Bring me the necessary thing for the ceremony...

...and we will see that it allows God.

And be what happens, you should promise me...

...that you will never return to this mountain.

I promise it.

I am here, girl.

Not ascend but.

I brought the wine and the bread, and the cloth
white.

Miz Elda was very kind in giving it to me.

Miz Elda should have thought it well.

She told me that it counted you something but.

He/she wants you to know
that he/she has not forgotten your name.

Please, give him/her my gratefulness.

If, Mister.

Now go to bed in the floor
and cover with the shroud...

...and maintain your very closed eyes.

Count me that sinned it is
the one that torments you.

My grandmother is you her sins
before dying?

No.

Then, if these of agreement,
I prefer not to pronounce my sins.

I absolve you now, Cadi Forbes,
so that you live a long and full life.

And for your peace, zeal my own soul.

Anything has changed. I feel same.

I sit down it, dear girl.

Please. You should say me.
As I liberate myself of that I made?

God willing I knew, Cadi Forbes.

God willing I knew.
