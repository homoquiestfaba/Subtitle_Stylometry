Good evening, everyone.

I am Max the Magnificent,

and tonight,
you'll be truly astounded.

Here you see two ordinary,
unattached rings.

Yes? But watch.

And now I will magically
unattach them.

I must have forgot
to say the magic words.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

Who is this mortal
that dare utter those words?

And now for my next trick,
I need an ordinary, empty

hat.

Bravo.

I am coming, my children.

And now I shall make
this celery disappear.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

Those cursed words again!

Listen, pest-head.

Told you not
to use my camera.

Ow!

I meant to do that.

What a clumsy dork.

You're such a dope.

I'd saw you in half, but then
I'd have two dopey brothers.

<i>From the light of Earth,</i>
<i>the dark descends,</i>

<i>should they return,</i>
<i>that all depends.</i>

Wait until YouTube
gets a load of this.

No.

Mom!

Where's my other magic cape?
This one got torn.

If it's a magic cape, then
why doesn't it fly up here?

If that's a brain in there,
then why doesn't it work?

What?

Mom? Where's my other magic cape?
You know, the good one?

Yes, I heard you.
It's downstairs in the dryer.

Put the finishing touches on your
magic trunk, O Max the Magnificent.

What happened to
Max the Greatest?

Let's start with Magnificent
and work our way up, okay?

Thanks, Mom.

Hey, Buster.
Come here, Buster.

Come on, Buster. Sit. Sit.

Lie down. Roll over?

Speak?

Please?

You wanna go outside?

Yeah. You know that one,
don't you?

Why doesn't he use the doggie door?
It's right there.

I'm working on it.

Max. I just put up
a new net.

Colin and I are gonna shoot some
hoops, then we're gonna go for a run.

You should join us, buddy.

The only time noodle-leg runs
is when I'm chasing him.

Hey. I can't risk
a leg injury.

There's a dance after
the Halloween Talent Show,

and I don't wanna disappoint all the
lucky girls who begged me for a shot.

No girls talk to you.

Hey. Yesterday, I asked a girl
to go to the dance with me,

and she said no.

I call that talking.

Look. I know you're not great
at basketball or any sports.

But maybe you should get out there
and pump up a couple of shots.

Practice.

After dinner, Dad, I'm gonna
practice my magic a little more,

because I want my act
to be the best in the show.

I'll tell you about magic.
You know the best magic there is?

Colin remembering to flush.

Okay. It's somebody
sawing someone in half.

Yeah, anybody can
saw someone in half.

Yeah. But you have to
put them back together again.

Magic.

Real magic is passing the three-mile
mark, and you're hardly breathing heavy.

Magic's catching a tight spiral
pass on your fingertips for a TD

or scoring a three-point shot right
at the buzzer to win the big game.

Pure magic.

So, you know, sports.
That's what I'm getting at.

You should get out there
and mix it up with the guys.

Dad? If I hurt
this magic wand hand,

it'll be a disappointing
blow to all my fans.

So, it's not for me.

I owe it to them
to not shoot baskets,

or run or jump or lift
or crunch or curl or...

So, anything that doesn't have to
do with those, I'll be glad to do.

Okay, well, if you
change your mind, buddy.

Come here, Buster.

So, cape's in the dryer?

That's where it's at.

Honey, would you change out
of your good shirt for me?

Don't we wanna
keep that one nice?

Or I could just iron it again.

So, I'm gonna head
there right now.

Sweetie, could you take all the clothes
out of the dryer, not just your cape?

Okay. Come on, Buster.

You know, I should've said,

"Anyone could throw,
shoot and make baskets,

"but not everyone
can do magic."

Hey. What you got there, boy?

What you got here?

Last week, it was those
cool magic words,

you know, "From the light
of Earth, the dark descends"?

Dog spit.

Don't you ever swallow?

You're like Grandma
on Thanksgiving.

Para... Paranormal?

Don't

scream.

Okay. Okay.

Am I a man or a mouse?

I do like cheese.

Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

No, no, no.

No, no, no. No!

Me. Just me. Okay.

Here! Here, don't hurt me!
Here! Take my dog! Take my dog!

You can take him.

Pants. Shirts. Underwear?

There's nothing
to be afraid of.

Has to be mice.
Has to be mice.

Mom? Dad?

We have mice with
really big hands!

Colin, knock it off.
It's your brother.

That's twice
as horrible.

I am angered.

Mr. and Mrs. Roland have
been banished for eternity.

But their children,
Nicky and Tara, are still out there.

If they have knowledge of the
chant, the expulsion spell,

and if they find the Cast Away Ring,
whose stone has the light of three suns,

they could banish us
to the depths of the Earth.

My children, please.

I realize you are in eternal pain,
but just try, please, to walk it off.

Now, there is a magician,
Max the Magnificent.

You should see his ring trick.
It's really something to behold.

He lives in this house and
he has knowledge of the chant.

Have Tara and Nicky
confided in him?

Are they working together?

I must destroy
Tara and Nicky.

What, Frank?

Question?

There are no questions.

Sorry!

Follow me!

Please try to keep up
and stop moaning.

Five days from now,
on Halloween night,

when I have
my full powers,

this wall will come down,

and we will be free.

Free.

And if Max the Magnificent
dares to stand in our way,

then he too
will be destroyed.

Please, Frank.

Sorry.

Tara? Nicky?

I will find you.

Oh, man.

Nicky, why is it so cold?

It wasn't cold when
we left the house.

And it's Halloween.

What happened to
the Fourth of July?

You sure we're in Plover?

Of course.
I recognize everything.

And then again,
I feel so different.

Hey, excuse me! Can you
help us? Hey! Excuse me.

That was rude.

Hey! My sister Tara
was talking to you!

Oh, look, Ms. Wright!
Ms. Wright!

Ms. Wright!

Ms. Wright! Ms. Wright!
Over here!

No!

Did you see what
just happened to us?

Uh-huh.

Stuff like this only
happens in movies and TV to...

To ghosts!

We can't be ghosts.
We are not ghosts.

No one can hear us.
And a car just drove through us.

No!

Ghost!

Ghost!

Ghost!

I can't see you!

I can't see you!

Hey, guys? I'm making a shopping list.
Where's the celery?

It's the fourth bunch this week.
Last week it was carrots.

Why don't you ask Max,
the Munching Magician?

It just disappear?

Well, I am magic.
Things just happen.

Speaking of weird things, anybody
hear mice scratching on the walls?

They aren't mice.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

A hand came through
the basement wall.

Look, mice don't
have hands.

Well, then the wall
has hands.

Colin, does that
make any sense?

All right. After school,
I'll go down there and check it out.

You? You're afraid
of any weird sound.

The next weird sound you're gonna
hear, me ripping your ear off.

Okay. No more ripping
ear sounds at the table.

Honey, move your backpack
before somebody trips over it.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

You've said that about a thousand
times. Where'd you get it?

I read it on something
Buster found.

I figured it's some sort
of awesome magic chant.

But there is more.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends when hands.

When hands? That's it?

Well, that's all Buster found.

Dork.

Buster is not a dork.

No, I think he meant
you're the dork.

Hey.

He said it, I didn't.
Get your bag.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

Yeah, I did it!

It's full of books. Okay,
it's top-heavy, you dweeb.

That's the reason
why it fell.

Max, pick your bag
up with your hands.

Hey, Dad.
Hey, Max.

Colin, big guy.
Dad.

I see you're in a cape.
Again.

Yep. Breaking it in
for the talent show.

But how long does it take you
to break something in?

I mean, you've been flapping around
in that thing for over a week.

It's not like when Colin got his
new football helmet on his head.

Now, that's something
worth breaking in.

The helmet
or his head?

You know, it's not just a talent show
Halloween night. There's also a dance.

You're on the committee.
I volunteered you.

Cha-cha? Come on.
Get it. Get it.

This has to be
child abuse.

I'd rather eat
my own underwear.

You know how,
with the snake...

Okay. I'm gonna go
take a shower.

And then, I'm gonna take my
athletic son to the doctor

to check out the ankle he
tweaked running yesterday.

Gotta be in shape
for football practice.

Right on, dude?
Got you.

Okay, Colin,
go get dressed.

He isn't limping.

Hmm.

Oh, glory, glory, glory.

Does anybody
hear that?

Yeah, it's the bus.
Hurry up, babe, you're gonna be late.

Max!
Don't forget your jacket!

Don't forget
your backpack!

Don't forget
your pants!

Hey!

What a bozo.

How is the great magician,
Max-o the Lame-o?

Oh, Billy. What a treat.

Thought you didn't
take the bus.

We moved.

Great.

So now I can get beat up on the way
to school instead of during school.

It'll save me healing time.

You know, I think I'll beat you
up going to and during school.

Thanks.
You're so welcome.

Well, being threatened
sure gives me an appetite.

I do magic.

Now you see it.

Now you don't.

That's it. I've had
enough of your bullying!

What did you say?

Can't get enough
of your bullying?

I was just kidding.

I thought our history teacher was
trying to hitch a ride, you know?

Yeah? Yeah?

So, Traci, are you serious
about your parents grounding you?

I guess.

I mean, I can't believe I got
a D in yesterday's science test.

I studied in between texting
until midnight the day before.

Oh, my gosh.

No way!
H2O stands for water?

I thought it meant
"Hi to All of You."

Maybe you spend
too much time texting.

Seriously, why would
you say that?

And now, let's see if I can
get my lovely assistant

to step back into
my magic trunk.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

Hey, Traci. You know,
I was wondering,

how would you like to be
the assistant in my magic...

Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Hey, Traci!

Yeah?

Hey.

I was wondering if you...

What?

I was...
See you later, Max.

Wait! Wait, wait! Wait!

Hey, guys.

Were you gonna
talk to Traci?

It's my right as
an American citizen.

I hereby waive
all my rights.

Man, I'd mop
the floor with you,

but I think this will
do you more damage.

She's not gonna talk to you
after she sees this, loser.

Hey, Traci! Come see
the king of the losers.

Max?

Present.

I see you!
I can see you!

Where'd we go?

We're home!

Our house!

Mom and Dad will know
what's happening.

Or will they?

No one can see
or hear us.

We're ghosts.

This is bad, Nicky,
really bad.

Well...

Look on the bright side.

We were never able
to do this before.

Nicky!

And here's something
else I found out.

If you concentrate kind of
hard, you can use your hands.

That's weird.
My hat just fell off.

Don't bother people.
She didn't do anything to you.

Tara!

Concentrate! Go for it.

I didn't know
you were bald.

Well, I paid a lot of money
for you not to know that.

Now see what you did?
You ruined this guy's whole night.

Me? You're the one
who told me to do it.

Now, stop having fun.
This is serious.

Yes, sir, Mom.

If Mom and Dad can't see us, I
don't know what we're gonna do.

D-O-Y-L-E.

Our name isn't Doyle.
It's Roland.

Well, this is our
house, isn't it?

It's our address.

That's our tree.

This is really scaring me.
Daddy, Mommy!

This could be
a good game.

Okay.

Who are they?

Where's our furniture?

Mom, Dad!

Mommy! Daddy!
Where are you?

Mom! Dad!

Daddy, come out! Mama!
Dad!

I am freaking out.

Let's nail these guys.

Who are you?

Colin, use your hands.

I usually do.
I must have fell.

My face is salty.

Dad?

Hey, don't do that
again, doofus.

Do what?

But you know what I mean.
The popcorn thing.

Colin, isn't it weird to eat
something the size of your own brain?

Hey. We're trying
to watch the game.

Dad, I forgot to ask,
what's paranormal?

It's easy.
It's two normals.

Okay, I'm betting everything
I've got that that's not right.

And you win.

Paranormal is the study of
ghosts and ghostly matters.

Some people have
a real talent for it.

So if I studied Colin, it would
be the study of para-not-normal?

Come on, buddy.
I'm trying to watch the game.

Dad?

We're not alone.

Of course we aren't.
Colin's right here.

Yeah. I mean behind me.

I don't see anyone.

He sees us!

You see us?

Uh-huh.

Okay, if you can hear us,
say weenie-weenie-weenie.

Weenie-weenie-weenie.

Yeah, right, that weenie could
bust your head open with one hand.

Where are our parents?

Who are your parents?

Buddy, they're your
grandpa and your grandma.

Come on now.

Why are you living here?

Why are we living here?

We got a good price.

And the people who moved out like
eight months ago, they just left.

Touchdown Vikings!
Nice!

Yes! Yes.

It must have been you guys I heard
this morning at the kitchen table,

you know, saying
"Glory, oh, glory, glory."

Lulu!

Halftime.
Bathroom break.

I got downstairs.

You had the closest
bathroom last time.

Race you to
go downstairs.

Lulu!

Oh, glory, glory,
where have you kids been?

I came back every day to make
breakfast, hoping you'd be here.

It's night though,
not breakfast time.

Life's been a little
strange lately.

This is Max.

So far, he's the only one
who can see and hear us.

Glory, glory.
So you can see us?

Yeah. Lucky me.

Would you like some eggs?

Sure. You probably make them better
than Mom, even though you are dead.

What happened to us?

How long have we been gone?

A year, maybe two.

Where'd we go?

I feel so weak.

Maybe I should
start working out.

This coming and going
takes a lot out of a person.

Your parents.
They found the tunnel.

They locked up
all the evil ghosts.

But Phears, he plans on letting
them all out on Halloween,

when he's at his full power.

You can't let him.

But we don't know
anything about a tunnel.

How do we get there?

Only the living can go
into the tunnel and return.

Only the living can help.

"Only the living"?

But we're ghosts.

I don't wanna be a ghost.

Can't hear you, honey.

I'm fading again.

Testing one, two,
three. Hello?

Are you this guy Phears?

No.

You seen a tunnel?
No.

And I don't know anything
about your parents.

I already have two, so I don't
need anybody else's driving me nuts.

Was that your dad and brother
in the living room?

Yeah. Why?

I'm asking the questions.

I'll show you what ghosts can do
if they don't get the right answers.

Yes!

Yes!
Yes! We did it!

What are you guys doing?
And where's all our furniture?

Uh-oh.

That's my mom.

Hey, everybody. I'm home.
Whoops, wrong house.

Okay. Confusing a confused mom,
that's got to be off-limits.

No.

From the light of Earth, the dark
descends, should they return...

Hey.

I've heard that before.

Yeah, well, the stupid chant's
gotta be good for something.

Where's our mom and dad?

I already told you,
I don't know!

Anyway, I'll help you. Just put
everything back the way it was.

Please!

Okay.
Thanks.

No!

A Mom look?
You're giving me...

Doing it.

I just had the weirdest
déjà vu thing,

only I thought I was
in the wrong house.

You know, Mom,

I think Buster needs
to go for a walk.

He just went for a walk.

Well, I know, but he's been
drinking a lot of water today,

so he probably has to go.

And that way we all
can go for a walk.

I'm not going for a walk.
I just got home.

Well, I don't mean "we."

I mean we, us, we.

I mean... I don't know
what I mean.

Bye.

Nicky!

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Stop. How'd you like
to hit your head?

I can't.
It's impossible. Look.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

I remember the words. "The light
of Earth, the dark descends"?

I remember Dad saying them.

Whoa.

Anyway, I read them on a
piece of paper Buster dug up.

Where'd he find it?

In the backyard.

Maybe Mom and Dad left us a
note! We'll dig in the backyard.

I used to bury stuff
back there all the time.

Are you guys serious?

Who's gonna explain
the huge mess to my parents?

Don't worry. We always
clean up after our messes.

Almost always.

All right. Look.

If you guys have to dig,

can you please wait until
after my parents go to bed?

'Cause I don't want them seeing dirt
magically flying around in the backyard.

We'll wait in the garage.

I wanna dig.
Garage!

Okay, okay.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Bye.

Bye.

Come on, Buster.

Great. All I wanted
was to do magic.

Now I've got ghosts!

I should have stuck
to raising hamsters.

What is it, boy?

Buster?

I was gonna say, "Let's
split," but this is ridiculous.

Max Doyle. Where are they?

They?

Do you think maybe we could
be a little more specific?

And who are you?

I am Phears,
the Animal Traveler.

Now, if you tell me
where they are,

I might let you live.

There you go
with that "they" again.

The children,
Tara and Nicky.

Oh.

That "they."

I'm afraid I don't know
anyone by that name. Sorry.

Max.

Would you like to see what
happens when I get angry?

No, thanks.

Well, check this out.

Next time I'll tell them
to make you feel the pain.

Tell Nicky and Tara that
their parents are gone for good

and that all of the ghosts
will soon be set free.

Okay. I'll tell them.

If you can tell them,
then you know where they are.

You cannot hide them
from me, Max.

We will meet again.

And if you tell anyone
that you've seen me,

my cape-dwelling friends
and I will haunt them

and make their
lives unlivable.

Understand?

Tell no one,
especially your parents.

I know where you live, Max.

When was the last time you saw
your parents grovel for mercy?

At my cousin Skeeter's
piano recital?

What?

Uh...

I mean, never!

I've never seen that happen. And
I really don't want to, Mr. Phears.

So I won't tell anybody.
No Mom, no Dad, no nobody.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

Don't ever say
those words again.

Buster? Did you
see any of that?

Or at least half of it?

Buster!

You're back, Buster.
You're back.

Oh, my gosh, you're back.

This Max the Magician has the
first part of Roland's chant,

the spell, our curse.

Take note. If Tara...

We have to find
Mom and Dad.

Or Nicky...

We have to find Mom and Dad.

Or Max...

I have to find
Buster's flea bath!

If any of these three brats
find the second part of the chant

and the Cast Away Ring, they will
send us to the depths of the Earth.

But I have a plan.

What if I could travel
amongst them?

Move about in secret,
disguised as one of them?

I must be certain
of what these kids know.

And I am going
to find out.

Hey, Max.

You know, if you'd spend
as much time jogging

as you did walking Buster,
you'd be a regular miler.

Anyway, Mom says the dinner/dance/talent
show is gonna be killer.

You're headlining, right?

Nicky's in your room.

Right?
Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah, headlights.

Yeah, that's me.
Deer caught in the headlights.

And I promise
I won't do anything

that'll make a monster haunt you
for the rest of your life. Yeah.

Well, that's considerate
of you.

We promise the
same thing, dear.

Yeah. And if Buster
splits open, it's okay.

It's a new trick
I taught him. Yeah.

Fetch would have been fine.

Well, I'm gonna go
to bed now. Good night.

Splits open?

Nicky, what are you
doing, man?

Your brother is weird.

He lip-synchs songs
into his web-cam.

Okay.

Let's not even get into what
he does with karaoke iTunes.

I didn't know ghosts slept.

Yeah. Being dead can
wear you out pretty fast.

What was that big box
your mom was working on?

My magic stuff. I'm gonna
use it in the show on Friday.

Tara told me
about Phears.

It's pretty weird he didn't
even notice she was behind him.

Well, everything's been
pretty weird lately.

Why should that
be any different?

Yeah, well,
I'm going to bed.

Nicky!

It's my old room.
I'll be good.

Are you sleeping
on the floor?

Well, this way I don't have
to make my bed in the morning.

All right.

So, I went out
shopping today.

I picked up this book on
wizards, shamans and sorcerers.

Mom!
Yeah.

Uh...

It looks kind of weird.

It does?

I thought the drawing
on the cover was cool.

Anyway.

This morning I got to thinking about
those magic words you're always saying.

What's interesting about
this book is that

there all kinds of expressions
and chants just like that in here.

Sounds like one of these
guys casting a spell,

a spell designed
to defeat evil.

Just thought maybe you could find some
more magic words for your act, you know.

Might be fun.

Mom?

Do you think you might wanna spend
the night in here tonight with me?

Honey, I haven't done that
since you were a baby.

Yeah, but don't you notice
something strange about the room?

You mean besides you wanting to sleep
on the floor instead of in your bed,

and your being in your school
clothes instead of in your pajamas?

No.

Oh, okay. Never mind. Sorry.

Honey, go brush your teeth,
get on your pj's.

Okay.

Pancakes in the morning.
Sleep warm in your bed.

I love you.

Love you, too, Mom. Night.

Magic.

Ghosts. Demons?

Splitting dogs?

Why can't I just
be a normal kid

who only has to worry about
how many zits to cover up?

I've got to do this.

What?

Where's Tara?

Rise and shine.

Morning.

Did I startle you?

Oh, no.

Why would I be startled when the
first thing in the morning I see

is a head popping
out of a toilet?

Look.

I've given you guys my house, my
dog, my bedroom and even my bed.

So there's one place that has
to be off-limits, and this is it.

Okay.

Tara wanted me to tell you that
I went dirt-diving this morning,

and I couldn't find
any more pages.

Where is Tara?

Inside your computer.
What?

Hey, weren't you just in the...
Never mind.

Whoa!
<i>Hi, Max!</i>

<i>Hi, Nicky!</i>

Tada!

Morning.

When I woke up this morning,
I found this in your room.

Wow.
It's our mom and dad.

The book mentions all these
parapsychology websites.

So I decided to go
on the Internet.

No, I decided to go
in the Internet.

That's so awesome!

I was looking for anything
about my parents.

Being on the inside, I got into
pay sites and no-access files.

A classified studies file
at Duke University

mentioned that our parents were
writing a report there on...

That's the paper
I found.

This paper was never seen.

Something happened to our parents
before they got the chance to publish it.

It's titled <i>Transportation</i>
<i>of Evil Paranormal Entities.</i>

Paranormal entities,

like ghosts,
vampires and ghouls

and Phears!

Whoa. I bet it was never seen
because Phears tried to get rid of it.

Or your parents.

Tara?

I really miss
Mom and Dad.

Nicky.

You been in a toilet?

Yeah.

Have a good day, Max!

I will!

I'll bring your
magic trunk to school, honey.

Okay. Thanks!

We're staying close to home
in case Lulu comes back.

She might have
more to tell us.

Yeah, and I wanna
look for the tunnel.

When he finds it,
we need you.

Oh, yeah. 'Cause only a
living person can enter, right?

What? Scared?

You won't go
in the tunnel?

No.

It's just Billy. He's always punking
on me in front of the other kids.

What a bully.

Just once, I wish I could use magic to
send him into space during school time.

I can't pass this up.

Me neither.

Morning, loser.

Morning, Billy.

How do you like this?
You really like this.

Back into the computer!

Searching for the tunnel.

You're welcome. Bye.

Hey, Max. Can I talk
to you in private?

Yeah.

So I hear you're looking for
an assistant for your magic act.

I might say yes
to something like that.

You're talking to me?

About your assistant,
I mean, my assistant?

I mean, I'd love
to have you do it.

Calm down.
I said "might."

Well, what'll it take to
change "I might" to "I will"?

Well, first of all, you have to
promise not to hang around me too much.

It's not good for a senior to
be seen with an underclassman.

You got it. I promise.

Secondly, I want my name to be clearly
stated in all advertising materials.

And it has to be
the same size as yours.

Done.

And fourthly...
Thirdly.

Right. Thirdly,

I understand you're capable of dealing
with advanced senior science class.

And I might need your help
for a midterm paper.

Well, I'll be glad to help.
Anytime, anyplace.

Okay.

But remember, this is
advanced senior science class,

so it might get
a little tricky.

Let them trick away.
Don't forget, I'm Max the Magnificent.

That's so sweet of you.

Beauty is, you don't have to
water them. They're artificial.

I hope you don't have
artificial hay fever.

Okay. Rehearsal here
after school.

Got it.

Now I've gotta
get to class.

I'll walk with you.
Yeah.

Max?

I was looking for
something. Yeah.

You're so funny.
Yeah.

See you later.
See you later.

What were you two guys
doing down here?

Just some magic.

No tunnel there.
No tunnel anywhere.

You asked for it.

Oh, yeah!

Lulu said that only a living
person can enter the tunnel.

This must be it!

Tara!

Tara, come on!

What? I was in the computer tracing
all e-mails from Mom and Dad.

There's thousands
and thousands of them.

And I found something,
an e-mail from Dad to Mom.

A wizard or magician can rescue victims
banished as ghosts by the Lord of Evil.

Tara... A wizard or magician!
That's Max!

Every word
by the magician can...

Okay, okay. Tara...

Listen, okay? The tunnel, you know?
I found the tunnel.

Really? Where?

It's right here.
Come on.

See? Told you.

I'm trying to
hear what they're saying.

Nicky!

Come on!
No!

Whoa!

Uh-oh.

Come on.

Help me!

Couldn't you, like,
pull a little bit harder?

I'm trying.
I'm a little girl!

I'd like my head back.

I'm working on it.

Help me!
It's your head!

Would you come over here
and pick up my head, please?

All right.

Tara, where are you?

Your head's on backwards.

It's the tunnel, Nicky!

I'll get Max.

I don't think they're gonna
be very happy he's dropping in.

Well, hello.
How did you get out of your cage?

Smaller is scarier.

Max!
Yeah?

We found the tunnel.

Where?
Your basement.

They weren't mice.
They were paranormal things.

Yeah. And everything
Lulu told us was true.

Hey, Max. I thought that we'd
walk to rehearsal together.

Yeah.

Max, you have to go
into the tunnel.

Not now.
We'll talk later, okay?

Later? But we're trying
to find my mom and dad.

And who's she?
That's Traci,

my assistant.

Look, Tara. I need some
really cool magic stuff,

things flying,
disappearing, really awesome.

I wanna impress Traci, and I
want her to be really amazed.

So, everyone on your bus is talking
about how your magic pushed Billy around.

It was so simple. You see,
I just unleash my full magical

powers.

Let me explain.

See, I have a unique gift that allows
me to turn my face into a magnet.

I just used my face
to open that locker door.

I better demagnetize.

No more locker doors.

No more locker doors.

You know, Traci, after
the show there's a dance.

Oh, you wouldn't.
This old hag?

She's wearing
too much makeup.

No, she's not.

I'm not what?

Not going to
the dance alone.

No. That never happens.

Usually some jerk from the
football team invites me.

If you were free for just one
dance, then maybe you could...

That's cute.
Cat got your tongue?

Come on.
Let's go rehearse.

Yeah.

So what was
that all about?

Pay attention to me.

You have to go
into the tunnel.

Tomorrow, okay?
We'll do it tomorrow.

Today, I'm rehearsing.

Hey, wait up!

Hey.
Hey.

My trunk. Sweet.

Hi, honey.
Hey, Mom. Whoa.

I brought your
magic stuff over.

Thank you, Mom.

You're welcome, sweetie.

Mom, this is my
new assistant, Traci.

Traci. Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

You're Max's assistant. Nice.
Yeah. Thanks.

Hope Max has told you
what you're getting in for.

I'm sure it will
be all good.

Max, if we don't go now,
it'll be too late.

No, it won't.

It won't?

No, no. Everything's fine.
It's all under control, okay?

Hey! Get down!

Max!

Hey! Stop!
Give her back!

What? Give who back?

Ms. Doyle? Is Max
always like this?

Yeah, he's always like this,
but never really as much as that.

Tara!

Max!

Max!

Come on. Open the door!

Max, I think I hear
someone calling.

<i>Help, Max, help.</i>

"Help, Max, help." He'll
be right there, sweetie.

But first, he has to have
some teeth drilled.

No, no, he doesn't. No, I'll take
a haircut. A haircut's fine. Please.

I love that sound.

His bicuspids
look spectacular.

We should take
those out first.

Bring Nicky to me
on Halloween night,

or we'll schedule
a second dental appointment.

Have a sucker.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

Quiet!

Max! I've grown stronger.

Half of a spell just
won't do the charm.

Remember,
always floss.

I unfortunately never did.

Max!
Open the door!

Miss Wilson!

Miss Wilson? Miss Wilson.
Miss Wilson? Do not fall.

Miss Wilson. Wait!

Okay, okay. Now fall.

I thought people always
fainted backwards.

Who's Tara?

Who's this person
we can't see?

She's just part
of my magic...

Was part of my magic act.

Oh, nice.

Hey, honey.

Hey, what's up,
magic man?

I'm just getting ready
for my magic act.

I don't know.
Doesn't really matter.

Oh, come on.
This is a big day for you.

And strange.
Very strange day.

Mrs. Murray was taken
away in an ambulance.

Yeah, she just snapped.

And our son was chasing
an invisible something.

Mom. It's okay. I'm just
a little stressed out.

That's all.
Stressed out?

Max, what have I been
telling you for years?

Nothing relaxes
a person like exercise.

Football, baseball,
basketball.

I mean, just look
at your brother, Colin.

Look how relaxed he is.

Nice.

Well, guys that only have to
worry about which deodorant to use

usually are relaxed.
What?

Come on.

Honey, I need
to talk to you.

About Max.

All right.
I'll tell you what, Max.

I want you to stay
out here with Colin

until you score at least 10
points against him in a one-on-one.

What? Dad!

Yeah, yeah, I won't take no
for an answer. All right?

No son of mine is
gonna be stressed out

when all he needs is a little quality
basketball time with his brother.

Now, get to it.

Max!

Max, you've gotta
get into that tunnel.

Where's Tara?

Look, I've got
some bad news.

Yeah? Well, so do I.

You're never gonna
make it to 10.

Look, Colin, I've gotta get inside.
Now. It's important.

Hey. Forget it.
You heard Dad.

You can't go inside
until you make it to 10.

Fine.

Come on, Max. I'm gonna
help you win this thing.

Okay.

What?

See you.

I gotta stop
eating yum-dums.

What, so,
what's your bad news?

Phears took your sister.

No!
Yeah.

If I would have paid more
attention to her at school,

then Phears wouldn't have
been able to snatch her.

Dude, this is
all my fault.

Listen.

It's not your fault that Phears
is trying to snatch Tara and me.

We're the ones that brought
you into this anyway.

Yeah, I guess whose fault
it was doesn't matter.

But we've gotta save her.

So what are we gonna do?

Okay, listen.

You know how Lulu was talking
about how there's a tunnel

and only living people
can go in there?

Yeah.

Okay, well, there must be something in
there that Phears doesn't want us to see.

You're right.

Something that'll
help us defeat him.

Oh, yeah.

Come on.
You're going in.

What?

Yeah. You have to go in.
I'm dead.

What?
Yeah, let's go.

What?
Yeah.

But are you sure about this?

I mean, what if
we're not ready...

Yeah, let's go.

Okay, okay. I'm going.

I gotta stop eating
peanuts, too.

Oh, wait.
This is just a dream.

Not a dream.

No one in the world wants to go
into this tunnel more than me.

Unless you do.

Are you afraid?

Afraid?

I don't know the meaning
of the word afraid.

Fortunately, I do know the
meaning of fear and petrified.

Okay. All I want you to do is
run and jump through the wall.

You want me to jump
into that wall?

Yes, you'll be fine.
You'll pass right through.

I thought that only
you could do that.

The fact that you're not a ghost is
the only reason you can go in there.

Okay? Get ready.

One, two...
Wait!

What if I can't find
my way out of there?

Then I'll end up a ghost
and I'll be no use to Tara.

You'll be fine.

One, two...
Wait!

I have two more
things to say.

What?

Don't let me do this.

One, two...
Wait!

That was only one thing.

What's the second thing?

Please, don't let me do this!

Come on, man.

No!
One, two, three.

Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

The worst is behind you.

Correction. The worst
is in front of you.

Oh, boy.

If only I knew
where she was.

<i>I'm here.</i>

Where?

<i>Back of the tunnel.</i>
<i>Go straight.</i>

If only she could
see me, too.

<i>TARA: I can see you.</i>

<i>I need you to</i>
<i>come to me. Now.</i>

Are you crazy?

There's a whole bunch
of people down there

that I usually try
to kill in video games.

<i>It's okay.</i>

<i>Just like when Nicky</i>
<i>and I are in your world,</i>

<i>you're the only one</i>
<i>who can see us.</i>

<i>Here, I'm the only one</i>
<i>who can see you.</i>

<i>Now get over here.</i>
<i>But be careful.</i>

<i>They can't see,</i>
<i>but they might be able to feel you.</i>

Tara. I'm here to save you.
I made it.

I can't. Lulu's right.

Only the living can
make it out of here,

until tomorrow night.

But that's Halloween.

I know.

That's when Phears is planning
to release all these spirits.

So what can we do?

I want you to go back and
do your show tomorrow night

and make sure
Nicky is there helping.

You want me to do my show?
But why?

You'll see.

And I want you
to take this.

Find the ring inside and make
sure you wear it tomorrow night.

It'll help your magic.

Now, get out of here
before Phears gets back.

Just like you can see him,
he can see you.

Stay away!

I'm back.

I'm alive.

But my face hurts.

Well, what happened?
Did you see Tara or what?

Yeah. She gave me this.

This is my dad's stuff.
Phears must have been hiding it.

But why? What didn't
he want me to see?

Let's find out.

Cool ring. I've never
seen this before.

Tara told me about this.

You couldn't get
Tara out of there?

She didn't want me
to get her out.

She just said to do the show tomorrow
night and be sure that you were there.

She said we'd find out why.

Are you sure?

Positive.

I think it has something to do
with Phears and Halloween.

But she did say to be sure
I was wearing this ring.

He plans on letting them all out on
Halloween, when he's at his full power.

You can't let him.

A spell designed
to defeat evil.

Only the living can
make it out of here.

Boo!

Can I have
a glass of water?

It's okay, Max.
You were only dreaming.

Are you sure?

Yeah, man. I've been
here the whole time.

Don't worry. No ghosts can get in
here without me knowing about it.

Coming from a ghost, I'm
sure that fixes everything.

Trick or treat!

Do you remember when you
were that little, honey?

No, just leave the candy.
It's okay. Come on.

Don't wanna be late
for your show.

So, we just do
the regular act?

Whatever that is.

Jeez.
Man, what a wimp.

Are you gonna let him
get away with that?

Forget it.
We've gotta get to the show.

Now get in.
I'll meet you at the school.

Trick or treat!

<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>to kick off tonight's entertainment,</i>

<i>I am pleased to present</i>
<i>Max the Magnificent</i>

<i>and his equally magnificent</i>
<i>assistant, Traci Walker.</i>

What do we do first?

I don't know.

Let's see what junk
my mom put in the trunk.

Hey, pick it up.

And pour.

Enough!

What'd you
do that for?

Well, you never
told me to stop.

Aha!

A deck of cards.

And now for my next trick

I need my lovely assistant
to stand next to me.

And what would you
like me to do?

You're doing it.

And now I need a volunteer
from the audience.

You, sir.

I want you to pick a card.

But wait, don't come to me.
The deck will come to you.

And now, sir,
pick a card.

Now, show it
to the audience.

Now, put it back
in the deck.

And now the deck
will come back to me.

Three of hearts.

Was your card
the three of hearts?

What does any of this have to do
with freeing Tara or my parents?

I don't know, brother.
She just told me to do the act.

A cockroach?

Well, I guess we aren't the only
audience watching the show tonight.

Okay. Let's move on
to some levitating.

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

Behold, on this the most
evil of Halloween nights,

my legion of souls
will walk again.

Oh, you want a little of this?
How about you? You want some, too?

Mom, there's real
ghosts out here.

Oh, honey, you know there's
no such thing as ghosts.

Hey, leave my mom alone.

Come forward, my children.
Forward!

Take your place eternally
tormenting the living.

Enjoy.

Max!

Hey!

Hey! Nobody invited
you to this party!

I crashed.

Now, I just need to find
the last of the Roland brats,

and I'll be unstoppable!

Where's my sister?

How accommodating.

Let me go!

"Oh, let me go.
Let me go."

Let go of my brother!

Max! Read the light!
Read the light of the ring!

What? I can't read it, it's...

From the light of Earth,
the Dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

When hands point up
to moonlit skies,

on ten-three-one,
the darkness dies.

You got it, Max!
Read it again!

From the light of Earth,
the Dark descends,

should they return,
that all depends.

When hands point up
to moonlit skies,

on ten-three-one,
the darkness dies.

Come on, everybody!

From the light of Earth,
the dark descends...

Stop reading
that cursed poem!

Should they return,
that all depends! No!

When hands point up
to moonlit skies,

on ten-three-one
the darkness dies!

No! No! No!

Grab a hold of Max.

We have to be holding
someone who's living!

No! Stop! All of you,
don't send me back!

Don't send me back! No!

Grab a hold
of our hands!

What?

What do you mean?

Wait!

Max, I can't believe it.

You made this fundraiser the most
successful one the school has ever had.

Thank you.

Max.

That was the most amazing
magic act I've ever seen.

Son, I can't tell you
how proud you made me.

I've been trying to get you into
sports and to keep up with Colin and...

Forget it.

You really found
your true calling,

and I want you to know
I back you 100%.

You made this the
best Halloween ever.

Thanks, Dad.

Everybody, everybody!
This is my son up here.

You really have made
this the best Halloween ever.

You guys made it.
Phears didn't get you.

Thanks to you.

Come on. You guys are
the ones who did it.

Now, with Phears
out of the way,

we can really concentrate
on finding your parents.

You know what?
I can feel Mom and Dad.

They know we're
looking for them.

And they believe
we're gonna find them, too.

We got the ring.
We know where the tunnel is.

And the evil ghosts are gone.

We can probably find more clues in there
and that should lead us right to them.

This is so great.

You know, it's weird,
'cause I can feel them, too.

It's like they're leading
us right to them. I know.

A little more investigating, and we
should be hooking up with them soon.

Oh, my gosh,
this is so great.

Oh, yeah. Listen, Max.

Go back there and enjoy some time
with your family. You deserve it.

Yeah. We'll see you
back at the house.

Okay. Don't worry.

Tomorrow, we'll dive head-on
into this investigation.

The three of us,
we make an awesome team.

And nothing can
stop us now.

Yeah!
High fives!

Bye!
