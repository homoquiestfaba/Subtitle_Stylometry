Really?

Well yeah for now.

So are you settling in okay?

Slowly... yeah.

Well it was really great
running into you.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Is that everything?

Yes thank you.

I'd actually like to buy
you a housewarming gift.

Oh no no you don't have
to do that.

Oh, I just did.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

But it... wouldn't be much of a
housewarming without people.

I suppose not.

You think you can make it?

Sure.

And by that I mean tonight,
like now.

Oh...

Well I gotta check my schedule..

Great! Looks like I'm free.

...and then I... out of my
parents house, into

Ethan's house. I'm a mom,
I work, you know I just...

I don't really...

feel like I know the answer
to that.

That's okay.

It's kind of exciting you know?

Cuz' now you get to figure it
out.

Here's to figuring it out.

Look you know, I don't
really know you.

And I don't know what
happened but -

It sounds like it's something
that you really needed to do.

And... not everybody does
that.

I think it's brave.

Brave.

So what about you? I mean
you're

you're a realtor, you live

temporarily in this neighborhood

Well, I uh

I don't have to just talk
about it

I can show you.

If you're free

I can do Thursday.

Cool.

Cool.

You're an artist.

In a former life maybe.

Can I keep it?

It's all yours.

This gives me an idea.

Walk with me?

Alright well, this is my ride.

When I was a little girl
my mom and I

used to come to the
beach

and take these long walks
to find

rocks or stones

and then we would assign
some sort of meaning to it.

An emotion or something.

anger, sadness...

...and then we would

throw it into the ocean

as this way of

releasing things we didn't want

I like that.

Did you ever do it for
things that you did want?

Yes, occasionally we would...
make a wish (laughs)

But it was really special
because my mom is just

so practical in so many ways

So whenever we did that
it was...

...it felt like something
magical might happen.

I didn't really have anything
magical like that growing up.

I did have this disappering
mom though

and this really cool key
I wore around my neck

If I used it...

...I could open my front
door.

Magic rocks sound a lot
nicer.

Yeah.

I coulda' used some of
those when I was a kid.


Mommy!

Hello

How you doing?

Good.

Yeah?

There was a guy on the
subway and he said 'shit'

and daddy told me never
to say that.

Great.

Well... daddy's right.

Hi.

Hi.

So we're gonna go to
the park and then

I'm going to make you
your favorite.

Pizza?

and she's gonna hang
out with us today.

Miss Emily it is my pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

park are you?

No.

You don't... nevermind I
don't love slides at all they're

confusing.

because I have all these
feelings for you

I really value our friendship

and I'm like, kind of
attracted to you

and

I don't know what to
do with that

so maybe it's better
left untouched.

Okay

slow down.

What I'm hearing is

you like me

you want me

and there was this part about
not touching but...

I think we can just strike that
from the record.

I do like you

a lot.

I'm just

overwhelmed by this feeling
that I wanna get closer to you.

Closer

I like that.

Can we just...
take it slow?

Of course.

You know I'm really concerned
about this bill

if this contractor doesn't
come through we...

I got it.

You got it.

I got it.

Okay while you got that

why don't you tell me

who's the mystery texter?


The flirtatious, smiley texts.

Oh the fliratious, smiley texts

Oh come on, who's the
lucky guy?

There is no guy.

Okay fine, if you insist.

See?

but only slightly.

Aww come on, details?

Come on boss.

don't want to spill.

(Distinct laugh in background)

(sound of rain and thunder)

(distant thunder)

â™ª (Instrumental music plays) â™ª

Hey...

Hey...

Oh, don't stop.

I wanna watch you work.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª (music ends) â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

...I... I..

I just I wasn't ready to -

step into that kind of
role today

What role?

It's not a role

It's just us.

I know Logan but it...

It is kind of a role okay?

And it's not just us.

I wish it were that simple

but it's not.

I don't know, I just

sometimes I... I...

I wonder if I'm up for it.

For what?

For being with a woman.

I mean

bringing a new

guy around today

would have been hard enough

but to look at everybody and say

hey I'm a big fat lesbian now

I mean I just... I...

Wow.

I hadn't though it through okay?

I didn't expect you to do
any of that.

I just prefer to be treated

like I exist.

You don't even do that
to a friend.

I just...

How do you do it?

How do I do what?

Love people?

I don't let anyone's opinions
affect how I feel.

Look

I understand

this is a lot of change for you

it's not easy.

I get it, but...

But I hurt you.

And the last thing in the world

I wanna do is hurt you.

Forgive me.

I do.

No.

Really

forgive me.

hotel roooms.

You could bring Emily.

Find time to paint.

I said I love you.

One more time.

I said I love you.

(both laughing)

I love you too.

So much.

Okay everybody

I hate these things.

Maybe you should stop
organizing them.

Next we're gonna be asked to
throw ourselves at eachother.

Um, somebody your own
size is good.

You'll do.

Sugar bridges.

So just take a moment

be with your partner, take
them in.

Remember trust is a really
important part of every

workplace relationship.

So you gonna tell me
who's making you glow?

You have a way of saying
things Sol.

Well I know that sex glow when
I see it.

Sex glow?

Okay so, partner A

turn away from partner B

Take one big step away.

Talk.


I don't know.

Try me.

You know Logan?

Yeah I know Logan.


I'm fucking her.

(sound of Amber hitting
the ground hard)

You know catcing me was the
entire purpose

of that exercise.

I know.

But you gotta prepare an old
woman before you drop

something big off in her
lap.

You asked.

And you're not old.

Thank you.

This is why you've been
so secretive?

'Cuz I'm sleeping with a woman?

Yeah it's just not something I
ever saw myself doing.

It's just...

Just so much stuff that goes
along with that, you know?

Like now I, now I
suddenly have a label.

Black, white, straight, gay.

There's nothing wrong with
being gay.

I know that.

But you know, a lot of other
people don't.

Girl this is New York.

Yeah

Call my parents, they live
in Brooklyn.

Besides I'm not gay.

I still, I still like men I do.
I'm just... I don't know.

Once upon a time

what feels like a lifetime ago

I was in love

with a white man.

And he loved me.

I wanted to spend my every
waking hour with him

To spend my life with him.

But back then where
I was at

it would have taken courage
I didn't have

support from family,
friends, peers

to walk down the street

hand in hand without having
insults hurled at us

So what happened?

I closed my heart to him.

to that entire part of my life.

I don't regret where I'm at,
my family

my choices for any second,
but...

that is one regret

that still hangs over me

and living with regret

is

only my doing.

I feel like when I close my eyes
I keep thinking that

if the world didn't care
I wouldn't care.

If the world didn't care,
I wouldn't care.

Life is a series of choices
Amber.

Every second we choose

our happiness or our
bitter remorse.

And we can only love who
we love

and stand by that choice

Times are changin' baby.

Times are changing.

So...

...step into your life

before it passes you by.

Oww.

(laughter and conversation)

Logan we are just so happy
that Amber

has found a friend like you

during such a difficult time
in her life.

And we really appreciate you
being there for her.

It's my absolute pleasure.

She's wonderful.

Nice to finally meet you.

Nice to put a pretty face

to someone we've heard so
much about.

Thank you. Great to meet
you both.

I actually have to get going,
I have a client to meet.

I'm sorry.

But please enjoy the rest of
your day

Um I have to go to the
restroom

so I'll just walk you out.

So

you met my parents

I like them.

Well that's because you don't
know them.


No...

I like them

and I love you.

What is this?


It's nothing.

You were leaving?

(exhales hard)

Yup, I'm leaving.

Logan.

Logan hey.

Logan stop.

I'm sorry.

You're always sorry Amber.


Hey look, I didn't expect you to
waltz into the cafe and

just announce your love for me.

But when are you gonna be able
to stand tall next to me?

I told you I just need time.

How much time Amber?

I have never leapt like this
before in my life

and I keep leaping into you

and I

keep falling on my fucking face.

I never asked you to do that.

You just did it on your own.

You jumped before I was ready

I don't know how this is my
fault

Fault?

Are you even listening?

Is everything alright?


Mom everything is fine.

Yeah

everything's fine.

Fuck.

Amber.

Shut up mom.

What just happened?

Please don't let me
fuck this up.

What'd you say?

I said I love you.

I love you too.

(knocks on door)

Hey.

Hi.

Only got a couple of minutes so

what'd you want to talk
about?

Hi sweetie.

Hi.

What are you guys doing here?

Well Ethan called and uh...

thought it was best that we sit
down and

try to figure this thing out.

What's going on?

Well we thought it best to
convene.

Convene?

Yeah.

Why?

So...

...you and Logan.

Are you kidding me?

Okay, honey that's that's not
why we're here.

Wow.

They... they didn't say anything

You did

right now.

Really Amber?

What?

Just explains a lot.

Okay I am not having this
conversation.

Okay, hold on. Woah woah
woah hey.

C'mon, c'mon. Ethan...

Can we try to focus please?

Yes, yeah okay.

I'll... cut to the chase.
Sit down.

Great.

Don't sit down.


I got a job offer out of state.
I'm leaving in three weeks.

What?

You're leaving?

Yup.

It's a two year comittment
minimum.

What about Emily?

I took the job Amber.

I'm not asking for your fucking
permission.

Ethan relax.

Don't talk to her like that.

What?

Can you stay focused on Emily
here?

Hey, you have no idea

Enough! Enough!

Stop it!

Enough.

Mom, dad, I...

Can we just...

Alright c'mon.

You're right.

We'll be in the car honey.

(door closes)

I don't know what to say.

I think that went well.


You know I really did love
you Ethan.

Part of that never goes away.

I know that you think that I
pushed you away

a long time ago I - I -
pushed you away but

You didn't push me away
Amber

you burned my life to the
ground.

I know. Mine too.

And I'm sorry about that.

I'm...

(exhales hard)

It's just that

I still love you.

And I don't know how to do this.

I'm sorry that you're hurting.

Look, I - I know

I was an asshole to you

a lot.

I regret that.

No - look at me.

Amber.

Tell me what to do.

(crying whimper)

You tell me what to do

and I'll do it.

I was a kid Ethan.

We were just kids. I - I -
I - I... (exhales)

You need to be able to see that-
I mean -

Can you see that?

Yeah.

I didn't like the person I was
becoming around you.

I hated her

and I don't want to be her
anymore.

I think that we both failed us

and Emily.

But Emily can't live without you

You're an amazing mother.

Yeah

but you're her father.

And she's gonna miss you
so much.

Why do you have to...

(Ethan cries softly)

I have to.

He's leaving in three weeks.

Wow. Just like that.

Yup.

It's just a lot of changes
coming my way.

I can help

with Emily.

I can help you.

But I gotta figure out
everything with work and -

just everything is going
to be really different.

Amber... Amber...

I don't think that you're
listening to me.

Hey

I'm saying that I want to
be a part of your life

and Emily's life in a
bigger way.

I know and that's very
sweet

but...

you're leaving for tour and

Not forever. I'm here we can
figure it...

I know but it doesn't matter
because it's not the right time.

(exhales hard)

You're awfully quiet tonight.


Yeah I guess.

Anything you wanna talk about?

There's just a lot going on
right now.

You know? With you taking
Emily on and

a lot of (exhales)
a lot of things.

Yeah.

I know it's gonna be a lot
with work but

I'm actually really excited.

I miss her so much.

Hey.

What's going on?

I think we need to talk.

Okay.

The owners of the apartment I'm
taking care of

are coming back early.

And uh...

You know I'm going on tour
for a few months

And I'm not sure

where my home base is gonna be
when I come back to New York.

Okay.

Is... that's all?

I ju... (exhales)

What?

I think we need to break up.

What?

I'm sorry.

I just don't think this
is working.

(exhales hard)

What?

We just can' keep doing this.

What? I...

I don't understand.

Look okay I know that I said
that this isn't the right time

but I think maybe once

Emily settles in a little,
you know

you can, you can

move in with us.

With me.

Move in?

Yes, I think that I'm ready
for that.

I'm...

I mean it Logan I am
ready for that.

That's what I...

You know if this is about
my parents, you know I don't-

I don't care what they think.

Emily loves you.

She loves you.

I love you.

I love you.

I know that I keep letting
you down

but

I never loved anybody like
I love you.

So why are you doing this?

Because Amber

I can't

love you from such a
vulnerable place.

You say yes to me and my life
is amazing

you say no and I'm
crushed and

I can't

love you from this place.

I...

I really...
I really...

I need you okay?

I need you.

I don't, I don't want to do this
alone. I don't.

You have all these things

that you wanna do

you know?

And there's so much you
have to focus on

and it's not me.

You gotta figure out what
you want.

I know what I want.
I know what I want.

I want you.

I want you.

Please don't do this.

Don't do this okay?

Come here.

Please don't do this.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

â™ª (Music plays) â™ª

So this is it then?

That's all?

I need you to go.

Can I walk you home...
at least?

No.

You should just go.

Can... I can still walk
you home...

Please go.

â™ª Summer in the green â™ª

I love you.

Go.

â™ª Soft beneath my feet â™ª

Please just go.

â™ª Wishing for another kiss
before we end this dream â™ª

Damnit.

â™ª I was yours right from
the start â™ª

â™ª Nothing lasts forever like
a broken heart â™ª

â™ª No amount of time â™ª

â™ª Can get you off my mind â™ª

â™ª You changed the way I
see myself â™ª

â™ª There's no leaving you
behind â™ª

â™ª Deeply you have â™ª

â™ª Made your mark â™ª

â™ª Nothing lasts forever â™ª

â™ª Like a broken heart â™ª

â™ª I'm standing in the rain â™ª

â™ª Getting washed away â™ª

â™ª A friendly face,
a coffee shop â™ª

â™ª You look like you're
okay â™ª

â™ª Laughing as I â™ª

â™ª Fall apart â™ª

â™ª Nothing lasts forever â™ª

â™ª Like a broken heart â™ª

â™ª My broken heart â™ª

â™ª Summer in the green â™ª

â™ª Soft beneath my feet â™ª

â™ª Wishing for another kiss â™ª

â™ª Before we end the dream â™ª

â™ª I was yours â™ª

â™ª Right from the start â™ª

â™ª Nothing lasts forever â™ª

â™ª Like a broken heart â™ª

â™ª My broken â™ª

â™ª Heart â™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª (Finishes song) â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Sounds good on my end.

I'm not sure what you want me to
do with this information Amber.

I don't think that lifestyle
suits you

or Emily.

It's for the best.

You don't think it suits
me mom?

It's not a dress that
we're talking about.

You asked my opinion.

No, I didn't mom.

You asked me how I was
doing

and I can't hide this

I'm sorry, I'm a mess.

Exactly why you need to
turn the page.

Nothing good can ever come
of this darling.

Why not.

Because it's not who
we are Amber.

I'm your daughter mom,
I'm not you.

Of course not but you're...

But what?

I love her.

Emily loves her.

And she left you.

It's for the best.

Yeah maybe it is for you mom
but it's not for me.

She made me happy.

She made me feel alive

for the first time.

And she loves me I know
she still loves me.

It's not love.

It'll pass.

It'll pass. It'll pass?

Mom this is heartache.

Okay?

This is good old fashioned
heartache.

And if you can't see that

if you can't see past
your shame

then I'm sorry but you don't
get to be a part of this.

You don't get to be a part
of my life.

You're gonna lose me.

You're gonna lose her.

You will lose us.

C'mon

We're going. C'mon.

Grace.

You just need to let her be.

Okay?

She'll ruin her reputation.


This isn't easy for me
either.

Not in the same way as
you but -

Mostly because it's not easy
for Amber.

I mean, I can see that.

She could just wait to meet
the right man.

She was

happy. I mean, had you stopped
to notice that?

Happy?

Put yourself in her shoes for
a second.

I would never be in her shoes
Michael.

Maybe being with Logan

surprised her

maybe it was there all along.

In any case

she's 30 years old

going throug a divorce

and coming out to the world

As gay.

I - I - just look -maybe

maybe she is

there's nothing we can do to
change that.

And I'm not sure I'd
want to.

Well you're on your own then.

Grace.

Don't do this.

She's still your daughter.

She's still the same Amber.

This is not something she'll
buckle under to please you.

Don't push her away.

â™ª (Music starts to play) â™ª

Well should we get some lunch?

You know what restaurant's
really close by?

Yeah.

You okay?

Mm Hm

Really cuz it seems like maybe
you're upset about something.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª (music ends) â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Hey there little girl

why so glum?

I don't know. Maybe we should
do some silly rock puns?

to make her laugh?

No, no, no, no, no, she hates
silly rock puns

Well

my sediments exactly.

I was magma before I was cool.

That's stupid

you're stupid.

Hey, hey, hey, hey

woah.

First of all that's not okay.

Okay?

What's going on?

I don't know.

What are you upset about?

I don't know.

You know what the feelings are
maybe?

I don't know. I said I don't
know.

Okay. Okay.

Look

I know it's been...
a big year

with a lot of changes.

A lot of feelings, big
feelings.

Confusing feelings

and I - I - I -

it's hard for a grown up you
know I'm, I'm feeling...

feeling confused too.

Really?

Yeah.

But you need to know that
when you're feeling this

when you're feeling confused
and angry

you can tell me

There's nothing you can say
that's gonna hurt my feelings.

Really?

Yeah, really.

I'm sorry.

No, I'm sorry.

I feel

so

angry!

Everything's messed up!

That was a good plop.

â™ª (Music plays) â™ª

Shall we get some pizza?

â™ª Salt water cures â™ª

â™ª Everything â™ª

â™ª And candy is for travelling â™ª

â™ª You made me believe â™ª

â™ª You had done it all before â™ª

â™ª And never thought you
wanted more â™ª

Oh it's mine but

honey I think it's time to put
it away.

Your mom will be here soon.

Do we have to?

I'm sorry love.

C'mon.

Can we play again
tomorrow?

Yes, sure.

How about next week?

Mm Hm

Next year?

Yeah.

What about when I'm big
like mommy?

Of course

I will always be there for you.

( sound of door opening )

Hey.

Hi mommy.

â™ª (music plays on) â™ª

I'm sorry.

â™ª You always take the
small roads â™ª

â™ª Cuz it's prettier that way â™ª

â™ª And when somebody's
crying â™ª

â™ª You know the perfect
thing to say â™ª

â™ª You're the woman I rely on â™ª

â™ª I hear you every day â™ª

Well thank you so much for
coming Phill.

Of course.

You're the best.

See you later.

Hey um, tell Sol I say hi.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª Music ends â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Are you familiar with her work?

Uhh, yeah.

What do you think?

Part of me loves it and the
other part of me is

terrified about what everybody
else is thinking.

You're the artist.


Well

now it would seem insincere of
me to say that

I think your work is
exquisite.

Maybe a little.

It is.

Thank you.

I won't take up any more
of your time.

Yeah okay. It's nice to meet
you.

Uh, Tim.

Tim, I'm Amber.

Amber... umm

Do you drink coffee?

Just cuz if you do, I
could sit next to you

while you do that.

Would it be okay if I called
you sometime?

Yeah.

Sure.

There's...

my contact information is at
the front desk.

Okay well then, I'm gonna go
to the front desk.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

Enjoy your night.

Excuse me

hi

Amber?

Yes!

Regina Dey.

Yes... yes I know who you
are.

It's such a treat to meet you.

I'm just so honoured that
you would

come to my opening.

I wanna talk to you about
your work.

I do... I have a few ideas.

That would be great.

Thank you.

Yes.

Well you have guests to
entertain. (laughs)

Yes of course.

Do call me.

You can count on it.

Thank you.

(inaudible whispering)

Hi

â™ª (radio music plays) â™ª

Pierce here performing live at

The Caveat downtown Toronto

Could you turn that up
please?

to have you in the studio.


I'm so happy to be here.

single 'Hold On'

is just climbing the charts.
Could you

tell us a little bit about
what inspired that song?

Gosh umm

I don't know where to start

dig in there a little bit more.

You know, we're live.

So you want me to spill my
guts for the world?


Well...

...for you JoJo, I will.

Umm...

Well you know it's simple.

it's about


you know, the kind of love
you dream about when

you're a kid. When you're
growing up and learning

about everything

and then you get older and

you stop believing in it

But... uh...

Turns out, it's real.


Do tell.

It's ah, in the past.
Long story.

Aren't they all?

Okay...

Umm...

Well when I first wrote the song

it was kind of like

I wrote it

for someone I hadn't even
met yet.

But umm...

when I played it for an
audience for the first time

a friend of mine was in the room


it was really clear... that

somehow

I had written it for her.

And that's the story.

That's it.


Oh my god.

Now what you have

all been waiting for

this is Logan Pierce
with Hold On.

â™ª (guitar plays) â™ª

â™ª (music plays on radio) â™ª

â™ª I know that you're
comin' â™ª

â™ª I can see down â™ª

â™ª the road â™ª

â™ª I'm travelling â™ª

â™ª But I'm not alone â™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª (music ends) â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

So when do you leave?

Should I go?

I mean, what if she was
talking about somoene else?

I... okay fine. But what it
doesn't mean what I

think that it means?

Tell me this

when you're an old woman

will you be okay and look back
on your life not knowing?

Wondering what would have
happened?

Your time is now.

Step in.

Don't hang back by the sidelines

I love you.

Well wouldn't that be a
surprising turn of events.

Mm Hm yeah... shut up.

(both laugh)

â™ª (music starts) â™ª

Okay go.

Go get your woman!

Ahh...

Don't you have a flight
to catch?

Yes! Okay yes. Thank you.
Thank you.

I love you.

I love you.
I love you!

â™ª Pour another coffee in my
cup â™ª

â™ª Give me something pretty
to look at â™ª

â™ª I need every distraction I
can get â™ª

â™ª It would be so easy to
slip up â™ª

â™ª Oooh â™ª

â™ª I didn't want to walk away â™ª

â™ª Oooh â™ª

â™ª But there was nothing left
to say â™ª

â™ª Gonna give it everything
I got â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna show the
fighters who's fighting â™ª

â™ª And I might be alone when
I'm on top â™ª

â™ª But I will be a hundred
percent in â™ª

â™ª Oooh â™ª

â™ª I didn't want to walk away â™ª

â™ª Oooh â™ª

â™ª But there was nothing
left to say â™ª

â™ª Oooh â™ª

â™ª I'm making my own dreams
come true â™ª

â™ª Oooh â™ª

â™ª I'm a better me â™ª

â™ª becuase of you â™ª

â™ª Becuase of you â™ª

â™ª Because of you â™ª

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª (Music ends) â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
(crowd cheers)

Thank you Toronto.

Have an amazing night.

â™ª Music starts â™ª

Oh hey

Hey

Great show tonight.

Thank you.

There's someone here to see you.

â™ª Everything can wait â™ª

â™ª Just a little bit â™ª


Hi.

Hi.

Uh... how long have you
been here?

The entire show.

You were incredible.

You... um...

I... I... uh, don't know
what to say.

I feel like if I

speak too loud

or ahh

move too fast you might
just...

dissappear.

I'm not going anywhere.

Um...

I heard about your art
show.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

So, did you

just come for the music
or...?


I miss you.


You were right

you know I really needed
to

see myself

before I could see myself
in the world with you.

I was looking for approval

from everyone. But what I
really needed

was my own and I know
that now.

And I know that

My life

just isn't right without you.


I want you.


I want you.
