[slow dramatic music playing]

[rhythmic thumping music
playing]

[girl in English]<i> My planet</i>
<i>Arrakis is so beautiful</i>

<i>when the sun is low.</i>

<i>Rolling over the sands...</i>

<i>you can see spice in the air.</i>

[inhuman growl]

<i>At nightfall,</i>
<i>the spice harvesters land.</i>

<i>The outsiders</i>
<i>race against time</i>

<i>to avoid the heat of the day.</i>

[thumping music tempo
increasing]

<i>They ravage our lands</i>
<i>in front of our eyes.</i>

<i>Their cruelty to my people</i>
<i>is all I've known.</i>

[dramatic music playing]

<i>These outsiders,</i>
<i>the Harkonnens,</i>

<i>came long before I was born.</i>

<i>By controlling</i>
<i>spice production,</i>

<i>they became obscenely rich.</i>

<i>Richer than</i>
<i>the Emperor himself.</i>

[exhales sharply]

-[stabs]
-[man screaming]




<i>Our warriors couldn't free</i>
<i>Arrakis from the Harkonnens,</i>

<i>but one day,</i>

<i>by Imperial decree,</i>
<i>they were gone.</i>

<i>Why did the Emperor</i>
<i>choose this path?</i>

<i>And who will</i>
<i>our next oppressors be?</i>

[inhales deeply]

[breathes deeply]

[soft music playing]

[Lady Jessica]
It's good you're up early.

Your father wants you
in full dress

before the Emperor's Herald
arrives.

Full dress?

Military?

-Ceremonial.
-[Paul sighs]

Why do we have to go
through all this

when it's already
been decided?

Ceremony.

Mm.

Thank you.

If you want it,
make me give it to you.

Use the Voice.

Mom, I just woke up.

Give me the water.

The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

[wind chimes tinkling]

[distorted voice]
Give me the water.

[wind chimes stops tinkling]

Almost.

[normal voice] Almost?

Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

-[Paul] Mm-hmm.
-You look tired.

More dreams?

No.

[narrator over speakers]
<i>Extreme temperatures</i>

<i>and treacherous weather events</i>

<i>make life outside the cities</i>
<i>of Arrakis truly hostile,</i>

<i>with sandstorms</i>
<i>powerful enough</i>

<i>to cut through metal.</i>

<i>Only the native tribes</i>
<i>known as the Fremen</i>

<i>have adapted</i>
<i>well enough to survive.</i>

<i>Preferring to inhabit the</i>
<i>remotest regions of Arrakis,</i>

<i>the Fremen share</i>
<i>the deep desert</i>

<i>with the giant sandworms</i>

<i>known to the Fremen</i>
<i>as</i> Shai-Hulud.

<i>Long exposure to spice</i>
<i>has given the tribe</i>

<i>their characteristic</i>
<i>blue eyes,</i>

<i>the Eyes of Ibad.</i>

<i>Little else is known</i>
<i>of the Fremen,</i>

<i>except that they are</i>
<i>dangerous and unreliable.</i>

<i>Fremen attacks</i>
<i>make spice harvesting</i>

<i>extremely hazardous.</i>

<i>For the Fremen, spice</i>
<i>is the sacred hallucinogen</i>

<i>which preserves life</i>

<i>and brings</i>
<i>enormous health benefits.</i>

<i>For the Imperium,</i>

<i>spice is used</i>
<i>by the navigators</i>

<i>of the Spacing Guild</i>

<i>to find safe paths</i>
<i>between the stars.</i>

<i>Without spice,</i>

<i>interstellar travel</i>
<i>is impossible,</i>

<i>making it by far</i>

<i>the most valuable substance</i>
<i>in the universe.</i>

[slow dramatic music playing]

[slow dramatic music
continues]

Smile, Gurney.

I am smiling.

How much will it cost them,

traveling all this way
for this formality?

Three Guild Navigators.

A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

By the grace of
Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

ascendant to
the Golden Lion Throne

of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

representatives
of the Spacing Guild

and a sister
of the Bene Gesserit.

The Emperor has spoken.

"House Atreides
shall immediately

take control of Arrakis

and serve as its steward."

Do you accept?


There is no call
we do not answer,

there is no faith
that we betray.

The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

House Atreides accepts.

[officers chanting]
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

Your seal.

So, it's done?

It's done.


[Duncan over mask]
<i>Stabilizers are too loose.</i>

-We'll dial it in.
<i>-Thank you, my friend.</i>




-[Duncan chuckles]
-Hey. Hey.


So, you're going
to Arrakis tomorrow.

With the advance team.

Yes, I'm going
to Arrakis tomorrow

with the advance team.

I'd like you
to take me with you.

You would?

Well, that's too bad.
'Cause no.


Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

What's going on?

Can I trust you
with something?

Always. You know that.


I've been having dreams.

About Arrakis and the Fremen.

[ethereal music playing]


So?

I saw you.

<i>With the Fremen.</i>

Ah.

So, I do find them.

There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

Lanville!

I saw you lying dead.

Fallen in battle.

<i>It felt like</i>
<i>if I had been there,</i>

<i>you'd be alive.</i>

First off, I'm not gonna die.

You're not
taking me seriously.

That's why
you want to come with me.

Listen.

Dreams make good stories,

but everything important
happens when we're awake.

'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

I did?

No.

Hey.

See you on Arrakis, my boy.


[animal chirping]

Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

Out of the question.

You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

like the rest of us.

I've been training
my whole life.

What is the point

if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

You know why, Paul.

You're the future
of House Atreides.

And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

Yes.

And look where that got him.

I need you by my side.

When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

What danger?

The Fremen? The desert?

Political danger.

The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

and this threatens
the Emperor.

By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

he sets the stage for a war

which would weaken
both houses.

But if we hold firm,

and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

we could be stronger
than ever.

What does that mean?

Mining spice,

keeping the Fremen
in their place?

We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

No.

By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

Here on Caladan,

we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

I want you sitting in
on my Council.

Learn what I do.

What if I'm not, Dad?

Not what?

The future of House Atreides.

[Leto sighs]

I told my father
I didn't want this either.

I wanted to be a pilot.

You never told me that.

Your grandfather said,

"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

He's called to it,
and he answers."

And if your answer is no...

you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

my son.

I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

In their memory...

give it a try.


with your back to the door.

How many times
do we have to tell you?

[Paul grunts]
I could tell it was you

by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

might imitate my stride.


Are you the new
Weapons Master?

With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

Choose your blade.

I've had quite a day, Gurney.

Give us a song instead.

[smacks lips] That's rude.

[Paul grunts]

[powers up]

[device beeps]

[Paul groans]



Come on.

Old man.

[exhales forcefully]

[Paul grunts]

[device beeps]

Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.


I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

-Mood?
-Yeah.

What's mood to do with it?

You fight
when the necessity arises,

no matter the mood.

Now fight!

[both grunting]

Come on!

-[device beeps]
-I have you.

Aye.

But look down, my lord.

You'd have joined me in death.

I see you found the mood.

[Gurney panting]

[devices deactivate]

Will it be that bad?

You don't get it, do you?

You don't really understand

the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

For 80 years,

Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

80 years of owning
the spice fields.

Can you imagine the wealth?

Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

They're not human,
they're brutal!

You have to be ready.

[dramatic ominous music
playing]



The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

It's done.


Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

How can the Emperor

take everything we've built

and give it to that Duke?

How?

Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

[breathes heavily]

What does he mean?

When is a gift not a gift?

The Atreides' voice is rising,

and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

A dangerous, jealous man.

[ominous music playing]

[voices chanting indistinctly]

[voices continue chanting]

[voices fade]

Paul.


What's wrong?

Get dressed and come with me.

What is this?

The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

She would like to meet you.

Why?

She wants to know
about your dreams.

How does she know
about my dreams?

And why is Dr. Yueh here?

He only needs a moment.

[Dr. Yueh] Hello, young master.

Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

What's happening?

{\an8}[whispering in Mandarin]

[in English] His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

[in sign language]

Paul...

[in sign language]

[eerie voices]<i> Who are you?</i>

Defiance in the eyes.

Like his father.

Leave us.

You must do everything

the Reverend Mother tells you.

You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

[Mohiam in distorted voice]
Come here.

Kneel.

How dare you use
the Voice on me?

[in normal voice] Put
your right hand in the box.

Your mother bade you obey me.

[Paul breathes heavily]

I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

A poison needle.

Instant death.

The test is simple.

Remove your hand from the box

and you die.

What's in the box?

Pain.

-[scoffs]
-No need to call the guards.

<i>Your mother stands</i>
<i>behind that door.</i>

<i>No one would get past her.</i>

<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

An animal caught in a trap

will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

What will you do?

[high-pitched whirring]


[exhales sharply]

[sobbing softly]


-[grunts in pain]
-Silence.

[Paul breathing raggedly]

-[Paul grunts in pain]
-[shuddering]

I must not fear.

I must not fear.

[stifles grunt, whimpers]

[suppressed groan]

Fear is the mind-killer.

<i>Fear</i>

is the little death
that brings obliteration.

-[whirring intensifies]
-[Paul grunts]

And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

to pass over me
and through me.

[ominous music playing]

[dramatic lamentation music
playing]


And when it has gone past...

I will turn the inner eye
and see its path. [gasps]

{\an8}[sobs] And where the fear
has gone,

{\an8}there will be nothing.

Only I will remain.

Enough.

-[panting]
-[whirring fading]

Like sifting sand
through a screen,

we sift people.

If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

like an animal,

we could not let you live.

You inherit too much power.

What, because
I'm a duke's son?

Because you are Jessica's son.

You have more
than one birthright, boy.

Jessica?

You've been training him
in the Way.

Tell me about these dreams.

-I had one tonight.
-What did you see?

A girl.

On Arrakis.

Have you dreamt of her before?

Many times.

Do you often dream
things that happen

just as you dreamed them?

Not exactly.

Goodbye, young human.

I hope you live.

[Lady Jessica]
Did you have to go that far?

to train him in the Way,

in defiance of our rule.

He wields our power.

He had to be
tested to the limits.

So much potential,
wasted in a male.

You were told
to bear only daughters.

But you, in your pride,

thought you could
produce the<i> Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

Was I wrong?

You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

But our plans
are measured in centuries.

We have other prospects

if he fails his promise.

Do you see so little hope?

we have done

all we can for you.

A path has been laid.

Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

[voices murmuring
indistinctly]

[breathes heavily]

[Lady Jessica] Paul.


That I could be The One?

[Lady Jessica] You heard.

The Bene Gesserit serve

as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

but there's more to it.

You steer the politics
of the Imperium

from the shadows.

I know.

You don't know everything.

For thousands of years,

we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

-to bring forth...
-The One?

A mind...

powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

Past and future.

Who can help us
into a better future.

We think he's very close now.

Some believe he's here.

All part of a plan.

[slow dramatic music playing]

[slow dramatic music
continues]

the air of Time,

Blown past falling sand..."

Young master!

How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

Exciting, to say the least.

My lord.

How are you, old friend?

My advance team
has secured the city.

We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

[ornithopters powering up]

They were pointing at us.

What are they shouting?

<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
"Voice from the Outer World."

It's their name for "messiah."

It means the Bene Gesserit

Planting superstitions.

Preparing the way, Paul.

These people

If we can't refine spice

-we're dead here.
-[Lanville] My lord.

The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

[Leto sighs]

What do they say
about this hellhole again?

"To shower, you scrub your ass

That's what they say.

That's what they say.

What is your name?

Shadout Mapes, my lady.

[Lady Jessica]
The rest of you may go.

Thank you.

Shadout.

It's an old Chakobsa word.

"Well-dipper."

{\an8}[in English]
You know the ancient tongues?

I know many things.

I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

{\an8}[in sign language]

{\an8}[speaking]
If you mean to harm me,

I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

it won't be enough.

The weapon is meant as a gift

if you are truly The One.

Do you know this?

It's a crysknife.

Do you know its meaning?

{\an8}[in sign language]

It's a maker...


A maker of the deep desert.

When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

the moment of revelation
is a shock.

You shouldn't be out here

They're out here.

They don't care
about heatstroke.

I didn't know date palms

these aren't indigenous.

They can't survive without me.

Each one of these

Twenty palm trees.

A hundred lives.

Should we remove them?
Save the water?

No, no, no.

These are sacred.

<i>The largest and most dangerous</i>

<i>To avoid making</i>

<i>the Fremen cross desert spaces</i>

You would deprive us

House Harkonnen

I give you my word.

We will not harm them.

If the Duke's son lives...

No Atreides will live.

My lord, you gave your word

She sees too much.

I said I would not harm them.

And I shall not.

But Arrakis is Arrakis.

And the desert takes the weak.

Gotta keep an eye on you.

Let's get started.

I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

The Harkonnens were taking

10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

Every 25 standard days.

Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

to oversee the transition?

Who did the Emperor appoint?

Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

Been here 20 years.

Eccentric, from what I'm told.

I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

A meeting's long overdue.

And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

A hostage. [chuckles]

I love it.

Hmm.

-[engine roaring]
-He's here, my lord.

[Duncan well-wishing
in Chakobsa]

[in English] Take care
of them. They are friends.



[both laughing]

I swear you're getting taller.

you smell much worse.

For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

Hidden in the desert,

in a community
called a<i> sietch.</i>

Stilgar, the leader
of that<i> sietch,</i>

has come with me
to meet you, sire.

This<i> sietch,</i> how is it hidden?

It's underground.

Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

How big was the place?

I'd say 10,000 people.

And there are
hundreds of<i> sietches.</i>

Millions of Fremen.

You were right.

The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

I never saw them.

Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

And I gotta tell you,

I have never come
so close to dying.

There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

They fight like demons.

Desert power.

Duncan.

-Well done.
-Thank you, my lord.


Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

Let him pass.


Hey! Hey!

Mm.


Welcome.

Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

of any man that respects mine.

[inhales deeply]


[inhales deeply]


[clears throat]
Thank you, Stilgar,

for the gift
of your body's moisture.

We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

[Leto snorts]


I believe your people and mine

have much
to offer one another.

No, no, you are Outworlders.

You come here for the spice,

you take it,
giving nothing in return.

That's true.

I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

Name what you want.

If it's in my power to grant,

I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our<i> sietches.</i>

Do not trespass in our lands.

The desert was ours
long before you came.

So, come and dig your spice,

but when you have it,

go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

Just a moment.

The Emperor

has given me Arrakis
as my fief

to rule and protect.

I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

if duty compels me.

But your<i> sietches</i>
will be yours forever.

And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

That's very honorable.

I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.


We would honor you.

Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

{\an8}[speaking Chakobsa]

I don't like him.

Our plan bears fruit.

But it will take time?

Yes.

It will take time.

Here, this is for you.

It's a paracompass.

The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

a simple compass needle
won't point north.

Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.


And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

and all kinds
of ingenious things.

That's a sand compactor.

[all chuckle]

My God, man,
you've gone native.

You admire them.

I do.

They're fierce but loyal.

They're attuned to the desert.

Part of it.

It's part of them.

You wait till you see it.

It's beautiful out there.

[dramatic music playing]

[dramatic music continues]

The Judge of the Change, sire.

Dr. Liet Kynes.

My lord Duke.

Welcome to Arrakis.

the Imperial Ecologist.

Thank you for the stillsuits.

They are of Fremen make.

The best.

With your permission, sire,

I must check
the integrity of your suit...


It's all right.

It's all right.

[chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

A stillsuit

is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

Even this early
in the morning,

you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

It cools the body

and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

Your body's movements
provide the power.

Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

to allow you to drink
the recycled water.


In good working order,
your suit won't lose

more than a thimbleful
of water a day.


Let's have a look at you, lad.

You've...

worn a stillsuit before?

No, this is my first time.

Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

Who taught you to do that?

It seemed the right way.

{\an8}[speaking Chakobsa]

[in English] Are you Fremen?

I am accepted
in both<i> sietch</i> and village.

Now, come and see
the spice sands

on which
your livelihood depends.

[dramatic music playing]

What would you do

if your ornithopter
went down out here?

You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

It's worm territory.

Dust cloud.


That's one of your harvesters.

[dramatic music continues]

[machinery clunking]

[Dr. Kynes]
You can see the spice

scattered over the surface.

A rich spice bed

by the color.

If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.


A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

Worms travel deep
but get closer

to the surface
when they attack.

If you are patient,

we should see one.

A worm always comes?

Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

It attracts the worms

and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

Is that a worm?

[Dr. Kynes] Big one.

You have good eyes.

Calling crawler
Delta Ajax niner.

Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

[Crawler over radio]
<i>Who calls Delta Ajax niner?</i>

<i>Over.</i>

They seem pretty calm
about it.

[Dr. Kynes] Unlisted flight.
Imperium business.

Wormsign north
and east of you.

3.7 kilometers.

[Spotter over radio]
<i>Delta Ajax niner,</i>

<i>this is Spotter One.</i>
<i>Wormsign confirmed.</i>

<i>Stand by for contact fix.</i>

<i>Worm is on intercept course</i>
<i>to your position.</i>

<i>Contact in five minutes.</i>

So, what happens now?

They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

<i>carryall Alpha Zero.</i>

<i>Ready for docking sequence.</i>

<i>Contact five minutes. Over.</i>

<i>on the carryall?</i>

[Dr. Kynes] There it is.

[Carryall over radio]
<i>This is carryall Alpha Zero</i>

<i>We won't make it.</i>
<i>You have to evacuate.</i>

[announcer over radio]
<i>Contact in four minutes.</i>


How many men on that crawler?

Crew of 21.

can take six each.

That's still three short.

We'll find a way.

[over radio]
<i>This is Duke Leto Atreides.</i>

<i>We're coming down to extract</i>
<i>the crew of Delta Ajax niner.</i>

<i>We'll set down on the west.</i>

Yes, Gurney,

have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

[indistinct radio chatter]

<i>We better abandon ship now.</i>

[indistinct radio chatter]

Where are they?

<i>If we take one step out there,</i>
<i>we're as good as dead.</i>

<i>Besides, we've got</i>
<i>a full load of spice.</i>

<i>-We can't just leave it.</i>
-Damn the spice!

I want every man
off that crawler now!

[tense music playing]

Hey!

Hey!

Seven over here,
seven over there.

Go! Go! Go!

[Dr. Kynes] It's here!


Paul!

your footsteps, old man.

Get up!

Let's go!

What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

Run!

[tense music continues]



Bless the Maker and His Water.

Bless the coming
and going of Him.

May His passage
cleanse the world

and keep the world
for His people.

[sandworm roars]

Hey!

-You cannot take such risks.
-[Paul] Yes, sir.

You have responsibilities.

I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

Go.

Dr. Kynes.

You saw it.

With your own eyes.
It's plain to see.

Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

We've been set up to fail.

That carryall was just old.

The desert
isn't kind to equipment.

You know what will happen

if I don't get spice
production back on track.


I'm not here
to take your part.

Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

Take good care of your family.

The desert's not kind
to humans either.

Spice is a psychoactive
chemical.

You seem to be sensitive.

You'll be fine.

Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

That wasn't
an allergic reaction.

I had a vision.

My eyes were wide open.

What did you see?

[eerie ethereal music playing]

[eerie voices]
Kwisatz Haderach.

<i>You can see.</i>


<i>I thought I saw my death,</i>

<i>only it wasn't.</i>

<i>I know a knife is important,</i>
<i>somehow.</i>

<i>Someone will hand me a blade,</i>

<i>but I don't know who,</i>
<i>or when, or where.</i>

<i>Some things, though,</i>
<i>are crystal clear.</i>

<i>I can feel it.</i>

<i>I know you're pregnant.</i>

You can't know that.

I barely know that.

It's only been a few weeks.

Three battalions.

As agreed.

[continues throat-singing]

[all grunt]

{\an8}[speaking Sardaukar]


[crying softly]

There is something
you need to know about Paul.


Don't think I want to know.

Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

he hasn't been the same.

He's distracted.

Jessica, you gave me a son.

And from the moment
he was born,

I never questioned you.

I trusted you completely.

Even when
you walked in shadows.

Now I'm asking you
this one thing.

If anything happens...

will you protect our son?

With my life.

I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

Will you protect Paul?

Why are you
having these thoughts?

Leto, this is not you.

I thought we'd have more time.

[Dr. Yueh] Have a good night,
Master Paul.


[Lady Jessica]
<i>You need to sleep.</i>

No.

Not like that.

[Leto sighs deeply]

I should have married you.

I'm sorry, my lord.

But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

[Leto breathing raggedly]

Why?

I had no choice.

The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

They take her apart
like a doll.

I will buy her freedom.

And you are the price.

For Paul.
I will do what I can.

And you

will kill a man for me.

I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

It will be your last breath.

But if you choose
your moment well,

it will also be the Baron's.

[wheezing weakly]

My lord Baron.

Dr. Yueh.


What do you want?

I jammed their comms

and lowered their shields.


[Dr. Yueh] I delivered
the Duke and his family.

to the letter.

And what was I to do for you?

Deliver my wife
from her agony.


[slow sinister music playing]

I said I'd set her free.

That you could join her.

[Dr. Yueh grunts]

So, join her.

No stillsuits.

The one thing

For hundreds of years,

Fanatical legions worshipping

<i>A war in my name!</i>

Everyone's shouting my name!

Paul Atreides.

You are your father's son.
You are my son.

There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

There were Sardaukar
with them.

-At least two battalions.
-What? Are you sure?

You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

you know it.

[Lady Jessica sighs] So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

What says

The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

And yet you risk your life

[Dr. Kynes] The storm

We'll be safe here.

Do you know
what this place is?

It's an old
ecological testing station.

They were meant
to tame the planet.

Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

The work had begun,

but then the spice
was discovered.

And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

Tanat,

will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

TANAT: Yes, Liet.

[Dr. Kynes] Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

SHAMIR: Of course, Liet.

[door unlocks]

Who are you to the Fremen?

[indistinct chatter]

[wind howling]

the Great Houses fear most,

Dr. Kynes?

Exactly what has happened
to us here.

The Sardaukar coming

and picking them off
one by one.

Only together
can they stand a chance

against the Imperium.

Would you bear witness?

Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

If they believe me,

there would be general warfare

between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

Chaos

across the Imperium.

Suppose I presented
the Emperor

with an alternative to chaos.

The Emperor has no sons.

And his daughters
have yet to marry.

You'd make a play
for the throne?

The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

He brought you here
to kill you.

What don't you understand?

You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

The Fremen speak
of the<i> Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

Careful.

The Voice from the Outer World

who will lead them
to paradise.

Superstition.

I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

and lost him in battle.

I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

I've seen your dream.

As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

with a wave of my hand.
