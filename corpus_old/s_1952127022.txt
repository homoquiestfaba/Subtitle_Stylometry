In every speck shines His divine light

Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

Because we are all in His form.
That's worship

What would have happened
if the red-headed man...

...hadn't woken up at dawn that day
to relieve himself?

Perhaps life would have carried
on in Delhi-6 as it had for centuries

And my life might not have been
turned upside down

But then again

When you got to go, you got to go!

In the Treta Age of the Vedic era

The evil ten-headed Ravan ruled supreme

The Sun, Moon, Wind and Fire
were enslaved to Ravan

Who could save the universe from Ravan?

A divine voice spoke: "I will be born
as Ram in Awadh to save you"

The tumour is close to her area of vision

Fatima, ask the fool how long I've got?

Ma, don't say that! Allah forbid it

Who do you have in India?

Did these five years with us bore you?

No, child. But you must merge with
the soil on which you are born

Ma, these are old proverbs

Son, think of it as my last wish

Ma, you're like a stubborn child

You make life difficult

You know I'll never go back to Delhi.

I couldn't see well in the dark.
He was 8ft. 2

Covered in black hair

His nails shone like knives

Anyone who dares to sleep is dead!

He'll creep up on you at night

He'll kill you. Murder you. Who is he?

Yes! The murderer is a monkey

A dark Black Monkey!

The Black Monkey kills.
The Black Monkey murders

Beware! 24/7. From Delhi, Kumar

The first one to welcome me
to Delhi was the Black Monkey

Maybe destiny was sending me a sign

Would you care for a paan?

Salaam, Mrs. Mehra

Now I can die in peace

My love dragged you back, didn't it?

I forgot all about you

Recognise him?

At last! Now my eyes can rest
forever now. Let me hug you

Come on! Give me a hug

I'm Ali Baig!

A flood of people!
Delhi is teeming with life

Everything happening at the same time.
Yet there is a kind of balance

You can't enter like this

First sweeten your mouth

Mamdu! How are you?

You're back at last!

Salaams, Hina! My sister-in-law

Why the long face?
Aren't you looking after her?

Gobar! Bless you, son

Guess who's here!
My grandson. Roshan

He isn't hungry

Only dogs eat when they're hungry.
Humans eat to bond with each other

Have one

Only the lucky few taste
Mamdu's sweets

Or you can't go through

My beloved has returned home

People have great faith in this place

They say if you hang a bell
with a pure heart

God will heed you

I hung a bell before I left and prayed...

...to return with my whole family

God heard me. At least in part

Home at last! Your Paswaan Lane

It's hasn't changed a bit

Your phone is ringing

Not mine

You must rest. I'll take your leave

Have tea with us
Some other time

Make sure you drop by

That's my ball

Got it!

Mrs. Mehra is back

How are you, Rajjo?
You look lovely

Welcome to Delhi 6. How do you do?
I am Rajjo

Rama!

Rama. Bless you

A local speciality

Home at last!

Roshan! Unlock the door

Which one?
The small one

The tulsi plant has dried. Some water

No water now

The tap runs only in the morning

It's like the government.
Works on a whim

Nothing like Mother Earth!

I was just 16

Your grandfather married me
and brought me here

I'll leave the world from this place now

Gran...

This way

Don't waste water. It's precious

Overflowing with emotion.
That's the beauty of India for you

Love is never given in small doses

Here, taps may run dry.
But amazingly tear ducts never do

Your grandfather! He never accepted
your parents' marriage

Never listened to anyone

"How is it possible?"

It chewed him up till he died

He'd say: "How can my son
marry a Muslim?"

I wasn't happy either

When I got to know your mother...

...I knew I was wrong

Damn it!

Must the power go now?

Your father was just as stubborn

My husband said: "Get out!"
So he left

And refused to come back

Except for once.
For your grandpa's funeral

See God's miracle, Roshan?

You were born on the same night

"Everything that happens is God's will"

Only his moustache sets you apart

You're still not ready?

Ravan is on his way to kidnap Sita

My scarf! Hey, mister

Can't you see? Shall I buy you specs?

Gran!

Lord Ram was born in Awadh
to put an end to all suffering

Salaams, Mrs. Mehra

Mamdu? Right?

I can't enter without eating
something sweet, right?

How are you, Madangopal?

Well. Thanks to the Goddess

Bittu! Isn't she Bittu?

How thin you are.
You were once so chubby

You're a stick now

Her American grandson
Must I dance for joy?

Roshan. She's Bittu. Their daughter

20 rupees from me
And a donation of 50 from me

Why be stingy with
the Benevolent One? Right?

Miserly with his sister...

...but loves showing off in public

You brothers never stop fighting.
Have you no shame?

You look dashing!

Young man, not Miss. Mrs!

Myself Jaigopal Sharma,
proprietor Jaigopal Electrical Works

I won the contract
for all the lighting. Right?

Donation, Mrs. Mehra

Gobar! Don't pester her. Come here.

What will you take?

One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

One note? I'll take two coins

He's got straw for brains

Time for a group photo.
Paswaan Lane! Stand close together

Are we in?

My star of Delhi-6. When are you
heading to Mumbai?

I can go anytime.
I'm giving the others a chance

Don't forget the 2500 you owe me!
Right?

Jaigopalji, forget about me.
Tell me about your shirt. By God!

I had better visit Malayasia too

Look! The moneylender's wife
is decked out like his jewellery store

So our wives nag us
to buy the same jewels

Then pawn them right back to him

Let me photograph you
and your lovely wife

Greetings, Annapurnaji

Pay your respects!

May you both live long!

Lalaji! Meet Rajan's son.
Roshan

Are you here to stay?

No. I came to leave her

What's your name?

Roshan Mehra

Any plans for the house?

Lalaji, I'm still alive!

I'll fetch you a good price
Can family heritage be sold?

There's no family left

Money is better than bricks and mortar.
Right, son?

You burger species!

With an arrow as sharp as His gaze

He stuck the golden deer

The golden deer
changed into the demon Marich

O Brother Laxman!
Ram is calling for help

As Laxman leaves,
the demon king Ravan appears

Sita hears his cry for alms!

The sage implores: "Give alms
in the name of God"

"God keep you well"

The sage insists: "Sita, step out of
the ring of fire. Hand me the offering"

As Sita stepped out,
the sage turned into the demon Ravan

You sinner! O Lord Ram, save me!

Ladiesand gentlemen

We are proud to welcome...

...Maitri Devi, the councillor for Delhi 6

The honourable lady is here

On behalf of the Ram Leela committee...

...we'd like to garland her

"May the rule of Ram reign forever.
I may die but I'll never break a promise!"

Lord Ram who sacrificed
everything in the name of duty...

...at His feet...

...I offer donation money
on behalf of my party and me

Please accept it

Join me when I say:
"Long live Ram and Sita!"

Long live Lord Hanuman!

Long live Maitri Devi!

In India, the gods dance
to the whims of politicians

I thoroughly enjoyed the Ram Leela

But even more fascinating
were the people

I was so exhausted.
But the real drama was yet to unfold

Hanuman! Go and see.
Two men have entered the forest

Hanuman! Where are you?

Where has Lord Hanuman gone?

Hanumanji, it's your cue.
They're looking for you

A monkey!

The Black Monkey!

The Black Monkey!

You slow poke

Manager! Come here

Is he the one?
No

Balls of a wimp! It's not him either.
Aren't you an expert at grabbing tails?

Carry on!

Whose phone is that?

Whose tail is ringing?

Yes? Hello!

Inspector sir, the phone
belongs to Roshan

Roshan! I've found it
What species is he?

Sir, please let me go

Did I give you permission to stop?

Who's this?

Roshan, let's go

Shall I slap his left cheek too?

Know who I am?

You must be a public servant

Balls of a wimp! Do I look like a servant?

There maybe few highways,
but there's always a way out

Thank you, Inspector sir

Mr Baig

Tell him how the wind blows.
This is India

You bow to a uniform. No choice

What did you do?

I offered him a paan

Wrapped in a bank note

This is Delhi, my friend

Offering you nothing
but love and affection

Delhi is a place for those who love life

A place where crazed lovers live

It holds you in a tight embrace

It lets you hear its heartbeat

Hearts to your left

Hearts to your right

This is not a city but a gathering of lovers

This is Delhi, my friend

Offering you nothing
but love and affection

Specs...
Do I need them?

Why the toothpaste grin?

Sunita, the scene today is:
Show some flesh, hide some

You want 4x6? 5x7? Laminated?
You've wasted my whole day

I have beauty. I have heart.
Apretty face and I'm smart

Apretty face and I'm smart

I, Bittu Sharma, will be your
new Indian Idol

Loosen up! Relax.
Be a little sexy!

Hey mister, watch your step.
Tread carefully on the path of love

The path of love
is strewn with cheats

Not bad! You forgot your lipstick today

No, I didn't. It got rubbed off

When do my lips try that?

What?

Your hair!

Your hands are too frisky.
Control them

They have a will of their own.
What a dirty mind!

Maybe they want something

Bittu, you never take me seriously

You'll appreciate me when
I make you an Indian Idol

Not a bad photographer.
You can cover my wedding

They're in black and white. No colour

I see life in black and white
But rainbows fill the Mumbai sky

Models! Money

I must make some money

But to make money you need money

Suresh!

Lalaji!

What a coincidence!
I was coming to see you

Your meter is ticking, Suresh

You owe me 166,000 rupees

Didn't you get the cheque?
I'll clear our accounts at Diwali

You have a week

Or else... I think you get it

Got it! You look smart today.
May I take a photo?

Say "ah"

Gran!

Rama is gifted.
She'll brighten her in-laws' home

Her brothers' quarrelling is
spoiling her chance of marriage

Damn their bickering!

Soon she'll be too old to marry

Age has nothing to do with finding love

When my beloved teases me,
sister-in-law ribs me

My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

When mother-in-law taunts me,
brother-in-law consoles me

My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

I left my parents' home
so I could belong to my beloved

My husband isa merchant.
He is leaving for the city

When I see him go, my heart sinks

My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

I left my parent's home
so I could belong to my beloved

Wearinga bush shirt,
he happily chews paan

There is no one to match him
in all of Raipur

My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

I can't swallow a thing

Eating too many betel nuts!
Who's there to stop you?

Aren't you Rama?

Wow! You've never met us.
But you recognize us

The one and only Rajjo!

How do you do? Is all well with you?

Your son is a gem

He's one of us now

We're keeping him.
Don't say we didn't warn you!

Keep him! He's yours anyway

You have a Delhi-6 heart.
Tangy and spicy! Like a Delhi snack

Mother!

Call 911!

We're going to the hospital

Irwin Hospital!

Get out of the way!

Mamdu!

She's very unwell

What's wrong? Tie this to her wrist

Lord Hanuman will cure her

We won't let her fall sick

Gobar, clear the way!

Why have they stopped?

What's going on?

Mother Cow is giving birth

Mother Cow giving baby cow

Move them out of the way. Go on!

Clear the road!

You're blessed to see
Mother Cow giving birth

Mother Cow is giving birth

Those who witness the birth
are freed of all misfortune

Here! Mother Cow has blessed you

Can prayer ever be stopped?

Mother Cow is giving birth.
People have gathered

How can the police intervene?

Step back! Everyone stand back!

Gran?

Move aside. Let us pass!

Your Gran is better already

Mother Cow's miracle!

Her sugar level had dropped
and she fainted

She's fine now

Back in America, we thought
Gran had no one in Delhi

But everyone here is family

Gran is dying, Ali Uncle

The poet Zauq says:

"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

Just stay

Stay as you are

You are pain

You are comfort

A gentle breeze

A stormy obsession

Smooth as silk. Jagged as rough cloth

Sometimes you quarrel.
Sometimes you're stubborn

So full of fragrance

I don't want to change you an inch

Without adornment. Without impurity.
No more. No less

I love you just as you are

All yours

In your rainfall,
I want to dissolve

In your flame,
I want to burn and turn to ash

If you wound me,
soothe me with a balm

I will soon love the wound you inflict

You are a river. Let me drown in you

Your father and I had a great time
when we were young

No wife and children. A girl-friend?

Just the one

Your father took her away

My mother?

25 years ago, if I had told Fatima
"I love you"

I might have a son like you today

But dreams only blossomed
In my heart

Your father had guts

He loved her madly.
He fought everyone

Not caring what they said
about Fatima being a Muslim

He fought for love

When I look at you,
I see that love

In your eyes and in the way you talk

But then I know...

...you will leave us too

Back to America

My life is there

All my pleas are written on my face

What can I ask of You, O Master?

You already know what is in my heart

O Master! My Master

Cracks blemish the line of my destiny

Repair my fate, O Master

Repair my fate, O Master

He who comes to Your threshold
comes to bow his head

He came with throat parched.
And found an overflowing river

He returned bathed in the shower
of Your light

The rich always buy the best urns.
501. 95 paisa. Just feel it

Do you have a gold urn?
With gems and rubies

Why show off in death?

Why save if you're going forever?

A copper urn. 251.95 paisa

I want a clay urn for my ashes.
Or I'm off

You're so old-fashioned. Here you are

Especially made from sacred Ganges clay

151.95 paisa
This is good

Roshan, hold it

Now I can die in peace

Here you are

Only 100?

Be happy

"The tree said to the leaf:
Listen to what I say:

"This is the cycle of life:
A leaf dies. Another is born"

I first thought it odd that Gran
was making these arrangements

A bit morbid

Who goes shopping for your
own funeral? Discussing death like this

I suppose we can't decide the manner
in which we are born

But we can plan our departure

The rainy season is over. Autumn is here

Yet I have had no word of Sita

It pains Laxman to see
His brother suffering

He longs to take away his pain

Fresh attacks in Delhi 6

The dark shadow of the Black Monkey
is cast all over Delhi

My heart stopped when I saw it.
It had bulbs on its chest

When I touched it,
I got a 500 volt shock!

Oh my God!

The earth gets its energy from the sun

But the monster Black Monkey's energy
is far greater

It can attack any time

They're all fools

The Black Monkey...

It tore her saree...

Do you want to be the next Indian Idol?

The Indian Idol bus is coming
to your town!

You pierced your navel?

Sexy, eh? I had it done yesterday

It must have hurt
Nothing gained without pain

If the Black Monkey has glowing lights
on its chest...

...it means it has a mother board

An electrical circuit. Right?

Leave him alone

Don't bore him with your theories

Young man! What happens when
Water enters an electrical circuit?

Right! Well done!
Hear that, Rajjo?

He's smarter than us

Made in America! Right?

So, if you see the Black Monkey's
mother board, pour water on it

Short circuit! Finished!

The end of the Black Monkey. Right?

Brilliant. It's time to leave

I'm not blowing my own trumpet.
But no one can touch me in electronics

Only father's old radio is beyond me

Until I hear a sound from it,
I won't give up

I'll see you at the prayer meeting

Good you're arranging a prayer meeting.
The Goddess will bless us

Hail to the Goddess!

Sister-in-law!

I don't know what he was telling Roshan

Something about the Black Monkey's mother
Sitting for a board exam

Pour water on it

He said pour water on it
and it's dead

But where do we get
so much water?

This chilli!

Let Bobby play with me
Stop it!

What is it?
Some sweets

Why? Has Mother Cow given birth?

No! Granny is well again. So we're
organizing a prayer meeting

I just came out of the toilet.
My handsare unwashed

Leave it inside

You're the wife of Madangopal Electrical.
How can you be so dumb?

You're from America, right?

Lightning strikes when it rains?
Yes? It does. Right?

Does lightning cause
the clouds to short-circuit?

Never heard such a thing
Neither have I

Throwing water on the Black Monkey
won't help

Stop that damn racket!

Do you think the Black Monkey
is a son of an ass?

A big hero!

Talking rot to the women

Uncle is right, father

My science teacher told us
about short circuits

Shut up! Son of an ass!
When you're my age, then talk big!

Must you shout in front of Roshan?
Mummy, I'm going out

Serve some lunch to Mrs. Mehra.
Then go to college

Pour water on the monkey? Ha!

You Americans think you own everything

You force your way everywhere.
Into any country

So shameless. You Americans
never ask for permission

What's the big deal?

It's a big deal for us.
We never cross the line

You burger species!

You know why the Black Monkey
wears shades?

How would I know?
It's stylish, boss!

You're smoking Indian cigarettes
when I'm around?

Try this, sir. Imported

Special filter

Is that so?

What a waste

Bobby, come here

Well, Mr Bobby? You'll get 90%
in your exams this time. Right?

No. 100%

Bravo!

Pulling your uncle's leg! Right?

Who started this round?

Ok! There's a beggar sitting
round the corner

Give this to him

That's my boy!

What are you doing?
I'll do what I want

Shall we go in?

Those damn ghosts live there
Go on!

You come too. Big mouth!

Don't be a kid. We're grown up now

What if we're caught?
No one enters Dead Souls' Lane

They say scary spirits roam here

Mummy says cigarettes are bad

But your father smokes

You coward!

I'm no coward
That's more like it!

In Delhi 6, Jalebi helps boys
become men

Jalebi? She's of a lower caste

So what!
I'll ask Mummy

You son of an ass! You can't ask
Mummy about everything

Now we're men

Sister! The garbage

Old letch!

You girl thief! You'll be dancing like a peacock
when I shove my broom...

The garbage!

Mrs. Mehra, the flowers

Go in

Simpleton!

Turn us into men

Who told you I could do that?

Everyone knows
Sonny, you still wet your pants

Still drinking milk.
You'll be men?

We're grown up. We want to be men

I'll call your mother

Be men!

Damn it!

Wretched parents!
Spoiling their children

The garbage!

In the name of Lord Ram!

Disaster!

What have you done?

Pure of body. Pure of spirit

Take your clothes off
You wish!

So what if Jalebi is human!
She's of a lower caste

You have to bathe. Come on

Roshan, listen to him.
Do as I say, son

Shabri, why do you hesitate?

Give me a berry to eat

She tastes the berries and offers
the sweetest to Lord Ram

Without hesitation,
Lord Ram eats berry after berry

Shabri is of a lower caste. Why is
He eating berries she has tasted?

To Lord Ram, one is inferior
or superior by birth

Ramji is God.
He is permitted everything

Rambihari

I need company. Bring Jalebi to me

The boss wants you

The key is here

Come on

You wretch! I'll fix you

Stand up!
I'm not going with you

Tell him that!

The police!

The Black Monkey?

Hail to the Black Monkey!

Where did the balls of the wimp go?

Who?

The Black Monkey! Who else?
Not asking about your father

Pass me the fog horn!

You Black Monkey

Your game is up.
We have surrounded the place

Be reasonable,
Or else we will shoot you

He tore through the roof
He must have springs for feet

You saw it?
What does it look like?

Who?
The Black Monkey! Who else?

Why are you winding us up?

If he's invisible,
how can he be seen?

The moron drives well too!

Before I knew it...

...I was adding
to the Black Monkey's saga

Because of me, it is now invisible

In the dark of the night, wearing a dark suit
and dark glasses...

...the Black Monkey drives a black Sumo

Once its dark deeds are done...

...it presses a red button...

And becomes invisible!

It's an alien

It attacked two girls in our area.
They were sleeping

We gave chase. But it disappeared

This monkey is driving us crazy

The albatross emits many sounds
while it is mating

If you breathe deeply,
it'll benefit you in every way

Great importance is given
in Yoga to breathing

Many Sumo cars were destroyed
in Delhi

But this Sumo belonged
to the Black Monkey

Have you seen the Black Monkey?
Yes! It's invisible

It is an animal.
Animals aren't in our jurisdiction

Not a case for us

A monkey?

A criminal!

Hurrah! The vehicle has lifted off!

The monkey is an animal.
Not our jurisdiction!

So? Will you do nothing?

Pointing fingers at us won't help

Look at our track record

We are most capable

Utter rot!

This case is for the Animal Ministry.
They must take action

Move! Go home and watch TV

Have you ever seen an animal
with a mother board?

Springs for feet?

No! So how does it concern
the Animal Ministry?

Talk to the Science and
Technology Ministry

If they stopped lining their pockets,
they'd have time for us

How right you are!

Madangopalji! It's from the shrine

I'm Jaigopal!
For once get my name right

Look! Look into the mirror

In every speck shines His light

Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

That's true worship

Look into the mirror!

Salaams to you!

He's a fine boy

Haji Mian!

Roshan slapped the Inspector last night

"You public servant"

"Do you know who I am?"

"You look like a public servant"

"Servant? Do I look like a servant?"

Then our Roshan, tall as...

...the Qutub Minar, swung his arm...

Did I give you permission to stop?
Carry on!

I explained. "Roshan is new in town... "

The Inspector can fix anyone

Masakali! Come

Come here, my child

Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!

Spread your wings and set the dust free.
Fly high! And higher still

Fly over cities, lanes and towns

Fly with grace on your wings.
Follow your heart's every desire

Blend with the wind. Stylish and swift.
Fly away, you gem

A colony of clouds is your lovely abode

Turn your head away from
those who can't fly

Fly! Do not be afraid

Do as you please. As you please

Fly away. Don't look back.
Smile as you spread your wings

Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!

What do you care about sorrow?
All you hear is the flute in the sky

The wind talking

The sun shining

Fly away! Never fear

Do as you please. As you please

Fly away. Don't look back

Smile as you spread your wings, Masakali

What's it to you?

Bittu! My child

I'll pour it in his tea.
Then swallow some myself

End of story

Whose tea?
That bloated haystack!

He wants to check me out. Marry me

Check you out?

You find us so amusing

What's wrong?

I don't want to get married.
But I don't have a choice

I'll have to walk a little.
Sing a little.

Pretend I cooked the samosas
Aunt Rama made. The perfect wife!

Hurry! Papa is about to have a fit

Yuck!

If you don't want to get married,
tell them your point of view

Who can dare talk to father?

They're made for each other.
Like Ram and Sita!

The princess arrives!

May I have a word? It's urgent

Not now. We have guests

I said later!

Do have something

Bittu doesn't want to marry him

You insolent boy!
Remember your place

She can't tell you.
Because she's scared of you

I said get out!

Bittu was going to drink rat poison.
And mix it in the tea

I am Sameer Abbas.
You're watching IBN-7

Breaking news from Delhi 6

This is what the Black Monkey looks like

The Delhi police offer a reward
of 50.000

The Black Monkey is the latest rage

No doubt about it.
That's what it looks like

Delhi is gripped by fear

People are so scared

Breaking news from Old Delhi!

In Delhi 6, pregnant woman fell
to her death as she ran down the stairs

She panicked when she heard people
say the Black Monkey was back

Fear of the Black Monkey
has caused another death

What is the Black Monkey?

Everyone in Delhi fears it

Is it some sort of plot?

Hey! The Black Monkey!

Is it inside? Or is it out?
