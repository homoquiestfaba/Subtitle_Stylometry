sponsoring--</i>

<i>Open Mike Night
at the Discovery Club.</i>

<i>If you have a voice,
we want to hear it.</i>

<i>Come on down and see if you can
knock Big Black off his block.</i>

Come on.
I wrote this one just for you.

I don't know why I let you
talk me into coming.

I think I'm the oldest sardine
in this can.

Well, you don't look it.
Well, that's true.

But it's your song.
You go up and sing it.

You're the singer in our family.
Honey, you sing.

Yeah, but you know
how to hold people's attention.

People love to just hear you talk.

Imagine how you're gonna knock it out
when you get up there.

All right, now.

Fellas. Fellas.

Nice.

Keep that applause going.

Give it up one more time for Black.

If you guys are having a good time,
say "oh, yeah."

Oh, yeah!

Please.
I went over everything with the band.

Please. I just want
to hear my song. Please.

Are you sure you want to do this?

You, are you sure?
That man is Black!

You hear that?

That's the sound of success, baby.

What you doing?

Wait a minute.

Let's get a room.

Wait a minute. Bro, you see her?

Good God, woman.
What's wrong with you?

Coming up to the stage right now
is a beautiful young lady.

She's just as fine as she wants to be.

Now, this lady is a Detroit native...

...and she's never been
to the Discovery Club...

...so I want everybody
to show her some extra love.

Strutting up on-stage right now...

...is Sister Anderson!

Thank you.

So, what's up, Mr. Manager?

We gonna do some business or what?

Black, you got to lose
some weight, baby.

Man, you must be crazy.
Man, all the ladies love me.

And besides, this old belly
is what helps me sing.

TV's getting bigger-

Clothes getting smaller.
Yeah.

You know, you'd be good on radio.
Man, that's cold, man. That's cold.

Lord have mercy!

All right.

I see you looking. Sure, you're right.

You were so great.
But we have to hurry.

We have five minutes
to catch the bus.

Give it up one more time
for Sister Anderson.

My goodness gracious.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

It's Sister, right?

You gotta forgive me for earlier.
I was all wrong about you.

You were foxy up there.
Promise me you'll come back next week.

Maybe. Maybe not.

But, baby, I gotta...
Excuse me. Excuse me.

I really don't date younger men.

No, no, please, you were so--
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

Where can I find you?

Next time it's your turn.

Hi.

Hi. Thank you.

You were so good.

That was so fun!

Yeah, it was.

Next time, can you get through
the chorus before you do your solo?

Miss Thing, next time?

Yeah. I have a lot more songs.

Then you better get a lot more confident
and learn to sing them yourself.

Slavery is over.

Really? You're not gonna
sing anymore?

No.

Assume the position. What?

Y'all are late, and she's up.

Sparkle. Hush.
Sorry.

Hurry.

What y'all doing in there?

My babies.

But I know y'all don't
love each other that much.

Sister and Sparkle, curl your hair.

Church in the morning.

You hear me?

Dolores, why is my window open?
I'm not trying to heat the outside.

Close it.

Good night.
Good night.

Is she gone?

Y'all heifers sneak out,
and I get fussed at?

Laugh at-- Laugh at that.
Is that funny?

Peace be with you.

And also with you.

Good morning.
Good morning.

You know, the Lord loves a church
full of happy, good-looking black folk.

Amen!

I know y'all happy
this morning, right?

Yes!

Ain't no frowns in this
church today, is there?

No frowns, no clowns,
not in church.

And look at the choir.

How y'all doing this morning?
Good!

Levi, there she go.
What? What?

Seven Sundays, seven churches,
and $7 later, and I find her.

That light-skinned girl?
There.

Oh, man.
Well, that's Tammy Anderson.

Yeah, man, she is smoking hot.

Tammy.
Two sisters. They all fine.

They can all sing too.
Is that right?

Sure, you're right.
But they mama crazy, though.

Y'all know better.

I know I can't sing,
but I can love to hear singing.

'Yes!
'Right?

I'll see you next week, right?
Okay. See you later.

Excuse me. You was at the Discovery
a few weeks ago.

Bible study's at your house this week?
Yeah, it is.

You know, you bad at this.

Just act natural.

Hi. My name's Stix.

Sparkle.

Sara.

Who is my baby talking to?
Nineteen ain't no baby no more, Emma.

What? No need in eyeballing me.
I tells the truth.

It's in my contract as your friend.

I'm telling you,
you hold on too tight to that one...

...she'll be unmarried
and back on your doorstep like Sister.

That's just temporary, okay?

Well, New York just spit her
right on back out, huh?

No.
You know what?

You worry about your daughter,
I'll worry about mine.

I'm just saying.
Yeah, what?

Mom, I need some money.
What?

They selling dinners in the basement,
and they going fast.

Mom?
Don't do it.

Mama, please.
Come with me.

Now you stop.
See y'all later.

Sparkle.

Let's go.

So I will see you
at Bible study, Sparkle?

Maybe.

<i>Another one of my white friends
came to me the other day and said:</i>

<i>"Where's the best place
to hide something from a Negro...</i>

<i>...and he'll never find it?"</i>

<i>I told him, "A work boot. "</i>

Y'all know he talking about us, right?

<i>People are always asking me...</i>

Where is she?
I don't know.

Ms. Anderson, where's the bathroom?
Down the hall, second door to the right.

Second door.

Thank you.
Yeah, second door.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Satin Struthers.
Let's give him a hand.</i>

<i>Great job. Thanks for coming.
Isn't he funny?</i>

There you are.

Why you not in Bible study?

Haven't you heard?

I'm a heathen. Don't want to sit in there
and be a hypocrite.

Well, we already
got something in common...

...because I only came
just so I could ask you out.

The other door. To the right.

Other door. Sorry.

Oh, y'all like that, huh?

Funky dance, huh? You like that.
You like that music? Funky, huh?

It make you want to dance.
Come on.

Get it, Mama.

Yeah, Mama gonna get it.

Mama gonna get it.

And you will too.

You keep dancing like that,
you'll bring home a baby you can't feed.

Let's open our Bibles.

The deal was color television
for an hour of Bible study.

I lived up to my end,
now you live up to yours.

So let's go to Psalms 10--

Reverend Bryce called.
Says he need you to check the books.

The numbers are not adding up.

All right.

What are you watching?

Oh, I love this song.

No, no. Too many hormones
unattended in here.

Let's go. Get out. Come on.
Sister, turn that TV off.

Thank you. Come on, let's go.

Bye, Sparkle.
See you.

Good night, Mama.
Good night, baby.

It was just getting good.

See you tonight, Sparkle.

Call you later.
All right.

See you next time.

Bye, Tammy.
Bye, Tune.

Well, good night.

Good night.

Why are all the cute ones
always so stupid?

Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

All right, I'm going.

Please, don't stop.

What are you still doing here?
That was beautiful.

Wait, that's your song?
You wrote that?

Only if you thought it was good.

I thought it was phenomenal.

Then I wrote it.

So did you write that song
your sister sang...

...at the Discovery a few weeks back?

Yes, but she kind of made it her own.
Wait a minute.

You wrote that song?

You wrote the song you were singing?

You wrote the songs in here too?

Yes.

What you gonna do with the music?

Nothing.
Why not?

Because my mother
would never let me.

Plus, I'm not the singer in the family.
Sister is, then Dee.

I sing in the choir
so I don't sit by myself in church.

No offense,
but I'm just hearing excuses.

Excuse me?
I don't mean to be rude.

I'm just passionate,
especially when it comes down to music.

That's why I'm here.
I'm staying with my cousin, Levi.

I'm from Kansas City.
We got a cool jazz scene down there.

I managed a few acts,
but the money's here in Motown.

And I want to be--
I am the next Berry Gordy.

I figure, his stomach ain't
growling like mine anymore.

Maybe he's leaving a lot
of steak and potatoes out there.

You mind if I hear that song again?

Still needs a lot of work.

Why won't you unpack?

I really don't plan on
being here that long.

You said that two months ago.

Sorry

Hey, don't ever be sorry
for telling the truth, Spark.

What was that?

Your Romeo is out there.

What?

You can't be throwing rocks
at my window.

My mother has a gun.

A gun. A big one.

There's an underground club tonight.

The kind that songwriters
don't want to miss.

You got to hear the music.

It's the stuff they ain't playing
on the radio.

Come with me.
He wants me to go hear music with him.

You've snuck out
of the house for less.

And I know just the dress.

You coming?

I ain't gonna bite you.

And how do I know that?

You're gonna have to trust me.

Can I tell you something?

I think your lyrics are too safe.

I mean, you got Dr. King, the war.

I don't think the metaphorical lyrics
gonna fly anymore.

What?
You impressed by my big word?

I was.

In the spirit of telling the truth,
can I tell you another?

I wouldn't want you to lie.
Then why do you lie to yourself?

About not wanting to sing?

I mean, Sparkle,
you writing these songs.

And you can sing.

So why aren't you singing them?
I'm no Diana or Aretha.

You know, you right.

You Sparkle.

Look, my mom
used to sing professionally.

She tried to break out
and it almost killed her.

So thank you, but I know
the realities of this business.

I'm just doing it for fun.
You know the realities?

Oh, stop.
I'm...

Listen.

What are you afraid of?

Your mom or your own voice?

Maybe you'd be like your mom
and never reach your goals.

But don't fall short of it
because you can't admit that you want it.

Okay.

I want to be better than Diana.

I want to be a star.

Thank you.

I had a great time tonight.

And just in case
I never get out of that house...

...thank you for making me
tell the truth.

Sparkle...

...do you want to be a star?

What?

Do you want to be a star?
Yes, I want to be a star.

No, I don't believe you.
Say it like you mean it.

Yes, I want to be a star.

Okay.

First you have to
write a song for your sister...

...something where she
can work the crowd.

Sparkle, you gonna have to get
over your fear of singing...

...because you and Dee
gonna back her up.

I mean, everybody loves
a good girl group.

Now, you tweak your lyrics,
make them more raw, more relatable.

But Fillmore, here we come.

Of course, you gonna
have to win Cliff Bells.

You have to be invited to compete.
Yeah, I know. I'm gonna work on that.

Now, I want you to work on your sisters,
and I'll work on Cliff Bells.

And you'll be our manager?
Of course.

Then you manage to get my sisters.

Do I have you?

Backup, remember?

Good night.

Cliff Bells?
Come on. I'm not embarrassing myself.

Didn't Marvin Gaye get booed there?
Yeah, but it made him better.

Now he's traveling, making millions.

Mr. Gordy is making millions.

However it may be, it was enough
to get him out of his mama's house.

You don't have to be rude about it.

Well, I don't really know
if you were asking me.

You never really looked my way,
so our eyes never got to dance, but I'm in.

And just to be clear,
I'm in it for the money.

Medical school is expensive, so, no,
you won't get 20 percent. Fifteen max.

And once I get accepted into medical
school you will have to replace me.

And if you pretend
like I don't exist going forward...

...I will turn my sisters against you.

Other than that, sounds like fun.

I'll wait for you guys outside.

I'll let you know.
My first day at Freeman's is tomorrow.

Working at a department store?

You ain't gonna make no money.
Sparkle!

Come on, Sparkle.

Everything I said the other night, I believe.
You used me to get to Sister.

You said it yourself,
Sister is the better performer.

Sparkle.

<i>Have you lost faith
in Mr. Johnson?</i>

<i>Well, I guess the president
would have to answer that question.</i>

Oh, who doesn't like Sidney Poitier?

But the movie, you liked the movie?
Yeah, I loved the movie.

More importantly, the next time
you take me out, you need to have a car.

Oh, I'm just--

I'm just waiting
on the right one to buy, baby.

Take me on a date on a bus
in the rain?

You're lucky I like you.

Look, I don't know any other way to be
than myself. I'm a straight shooter.

So here we go.

I like you too.

I do, and I want to be your man.

I'm serious. I ain't like all the other
jive guys that just want to do you.

I heard about your reputation.

I just think it's what guys say...

...when they see something beautiful
and know they can't have it.

So they'd rather tear it down
than make it something they want.

But I see your beauty.

Outside and inside.

I want to earn it.

Kind of like a job.

Yeah, so just tell me what you need
to fall in love with me.

Because whatever it is, I'll do it, girl.

Whether you believe it or not,
I'm already in love with you.

I already heard it so much,
it all sounds like BS to me.

Maybe I better roll up
my sleeves then, huh?

Hopefully not as high as your pants.
What's wrong with my pants, girl?

This is the style. You can see my socks.
Change it.

Put some sugar in them shoes.

So I can sweet-talk
my pants down, huh?

What's this?

Open it up.

Oh, Levi.

I swear,
one day that's gonna be yours.

I promise you.

That's Satin Struthers.

Now that's some of the coolest trolling
I done seen in a long time.

Did you see this cat, Ham?
Yeah, I see him.

What's your name, brother?

Levison, but they call me Levi.

Levi, here I am buying the real deal
for these women...

...and you tell me
you cut a picture out of a magazine...

...and just put it in a box?

I'm about to go get me
some scissors...

...and cut some pictures out of magazines
like your boy Levi right here.

Clip-clip, hussies.
Clip-clip, hussies.

Can I see it? Let me see that.

This is nice.

You got a good man here.

Yep.

Yeah, I used to eat in here
back in the day...

...when I was struggling.

This is some real cheap,
good food.

But I'm not gonna hold you guys.

Have a good night.

Levi.

Satin.

Did you see her?
You were so wrong.

Tammy, I should get you home.

Sure.

Mama was so pretty.

Oh, here's Dee's daddy.

Here's a good one of
yours and Sister's daddy.

Cute, but no good.

You got to watch out
for those cute ones, baby.

They make a lot of promises.

My goodness. Lookit here.

Gonna be the first store
in Detroit to have one of these.

She's pretty, Mama.
Oh, a chocolate mannequin.

Ain't it something?

Dr. King said
we would have integration.

That's right.
Look what I found.

What's that?
The other, nicer you.

Sparkle, you go to lunch.

You come with me and let me try
to fit your behind in this dress.

See how she do me?
Come on.

She used to be real nice, girl.

She's in there somewhere.
Come on out, nice girl.

See you later.

I got Cliff Bells.

Got my first check.

Well, let me see.

Ninety-six dollars?

For two weeks of standing on your feet
and kissing rich white women's butts?

I am never gonna get out of here.

Stix said we can make
anywhere from 500 to $1000...

...if we win Cliff Bells' talent contest.

Don't say it all dry like that. Sell it.

So y'all talking to Stix now?

No. She was talking to Stix, I was
talking to her, now we're talking to you.

You sure you want to do this?
Yes.

You know, they say
you shouldn't eat where you--

It's the other way around.
She gets the point.

You guys, I thought about it...

...and I want to do this for me,
not for him.

So how much
we gonna make a week?

Thank you. Thank you.
Okay. Okay.

Hello, Mr. Manager.
Hey.

Got them here, cousin.
Surprised?

Yeah-- Not at all. Thank God.

Well, we come a dime a dozen,
don't we?

Coz, let me get the girls signed in.

Okay, okay, you do that.

Give them hell, baby.

Levi.
What's shaking, man?

Hey, can I get a picture?

Here you go, man.
Okay.

Satin.

Oh, picture-in-a-box brother.

Might not forget a face,
but I'll forget a name in a minute.

Levi, Satin. Levi.

Ladies, this is... See, I forgot already.

I got the girls signed in.

Righteous. Righteous.
Cousin, this is Satin Struthers.

I know who it is. You're a funny man.
Thank you.

This is his right hand, Hamster.

Ham, man. Ham.
Ham.

This is my cousin, Stix.

He's the manager of my girlfriend
and her sisters.

They performing later tonight.
I hope they're good.

I'm looking for a new act
to open up for my show.

Satin.

Hey, Mr. Bell.
Hey, how are you tonight?

You know, hanging.
Got a table for you in front.

Okay, cool. Come sit with us.

I'd rather have the manager
than the boyfriend.

Boyfriend can't do nothing for me.
Come on over here.

Have a good evening.

Nice socks.

They were amazing.
Give them another round of applause.

Hey, I see we got Mr. Satin Struthers
in the audience tonight.

Show him some love, y'all. Yeah.

Looking good too.

Boy cleaner than a Sunday chitlin.

Yeah.

Coming up next is another girl group.
Okay, go out and look pretty.

This isn't what we rehearsed.
You want to win, don't you?

Go.

Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

...Sister and her Sisters.

Where in the world did you get
those church dresses?

What happened?
You forget the words?

<i>Where is she?</i>

Hey, get this man a drink.
He's gonna need one.

They good.

I'll have you booked
all over the city.

Diana ain't got nothing on you.

Hey, Sister, you were amazing.
You were amazing.

Sparkle, I need more of the songs.
You know, the kind we talked about.

I can do that.
All right.

We need--
We need new dresses, Mr. Manager.

We need to get home before
Mama wakes up and finds out we took--

No, stole, the car. I'm not trying to die.
No.

Levi, drive careful.
Yeah?

You got my future in this car.

Yes!

Daddy need three new, pretty dresses.
Eight ball, side pocket.

Damn!

You got this.

Thank you for your involuntary contribution
to Stix Incorporated Wardrobe Fund.

You was impressed by my big words,
weren't you?

Man, just shoot the damn ball.

They loved us!

You finally hit that note, Sister.
They didn't come to hear me sing, honey.

We need more money,
or you need to book us at a better club.

I know what you need
before you know.

Mr. Manager, that was out of sight.

Sparkle, I didn't know you had it like that.
And, Dee, you were good.

Okay.
But you... You.

Sister, you were on fire.

You'll mess up my lipstick.

Yeah, well, as much as I want
to mess up your lipstick...

...I gotta go to work.

Since when you working
the graveyard shift?

Since I got a woman
that's got needs, cousin. Look at her.

Satin.

Didn't know you was still in the house.
Yeah.

Let me introduce you to my family.
This is Sparkle. This is Dee.

This is Satin Struthers.
Pleased to meet you.

Pleased to meet you.
Hi.

And over here, in this corner, this is--
We know each other.

Well, first, I'd like to congratulate you
on your performance.

Thank you.
And secondly...

...I'd like to give you something.

You know, dreams do come true.

Oh, my God.

Levi!
Trying to take my girl?

Get off me.

Let me have him!

Come on, Levi.
What's wrong with you, Negro?

Take me at least 30 minutes
to get my hair like this.

It's gonna get messed up
tonight anyway.

I'm sorry, sisters. I'm gonna go outside
and be waiting on you.

Oh, my God.

How could you do that to Levi?

Oh, Levi's a grown man.
He can handle himself.

Don't listen to her.
She's damn near 30 and not married.

Shut up.
You shut up.

But Levi loves you.

Spark, when you see a train that's gonna
get you to where you're trying to go...

...you can't wait to live.

You gotta jump on it.

He ain't got nothing else on me.

What he got?
More money? Better clothes?

What else he got?
He got nothing on me.

But she ain't worth it.
He ain't worth it.

You my family. I'm your blood.
Then act like it!

Act like you're my blood!
Hey.

If not for more than the drool that you
deposit on my couch every single night...

-...you should have had my back.
I did have your back.

No, you didn't.

You didn't have my back.
Oh, coz.

<i>It's business.</i>

It's just business.

Levi, where you going?

Levi, it ain't personal.

Just business, right?

Mercy, mercy, mercy!

Let's get this food out here,
Miss Emma.

The Lord loves good-smelling food.

Smells so good, Mama.

Thank you, baby.
Delicious.

Okay. Reverend,
will you bless the food, please?

Sister's not here yet.
She said she was coming.

Sparkle, those who do, do, baby.

Pastor, thank you.

Please, bow our heads.

Our Father in heaven...

...for this meal you have given,
we want to say thank you.

And...bless the ones who prepared it.

And, Lord, as we share it,
will you stay with us...

...and be our guest of honor?

But not just at this meal,
but God in our waking...

...God in our speaking,
God in our playing...

...God in our digesting...

...God in our working,
God in our resting.

In a world where so many are lonely...

...may we share this friendship
with joyful hearts.

Amen.
May this food, so fresh and fragrant...

...call forth reverence for you
in our souls.

As you give this strength
to our perishable limbs...

...so give us grace
for our immortal lives.

And let's not forget the blessings
on this family, Father God.

Lord, we thank you. Amen.

Amen!

Now, that's why black folks
can't get ahead, right there.

Not because we lazy.

It's because we're too busy praying
over 40 acres and a mule.

Now, by the time
black folks get to "amen"...

...the mule is dog food...

...and the 40 acres is sold
from underneath us.

Because we too busy praying.

Mom, this is Satin.

Pleasure.
Pleasure is mine, all mine.

Two dollars say
he doesn't make it to dessert.

Five says he doesn't get food on his plate.
Look at Mama's face.

This is Mrs. Waters.
Pleasure.

And Tune Ann.
Hey, Tune Ann.

My sisters.
Hey.

And this is the Reverend Bryce.

What do you say, Rev?

Satin Struthers.

Yeah, yeah, I seen you on TV.

You were pretty hard
on the folk in Detroit after the riots.

Well, I was telling the truth, you know.
It shows a lack of intelligence...

...for someone to loot
their own neighborhood.

Well, people were angry.

At white people.

Hell, go tear up they shit.
What--?

Definitely not making it to dessert.

Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hail Mary.

That's Catholic.

It's still Christian, right?

I mean, come on.
I understand, I understand.

I was trying to get black people
to see it from a different perspective.

Burning and looting your own
neighborhood may be misguided...

...but at least those people out there
were trying to fight to change the system.

Now, with all due respect...

...you just trying to
make a dollar off their pain.

I bet you know a little bit more about
making dollars off of people's pain.

You packing them
into church every Sunday.

Giving them a show,
got them hooting and hollering. Yeah.

You know what, Rev?

The only difference
between me and you...

...is you collect your fee at the pew...

...I collect mine at the door.

Well, Ms. Anderson...

...I guess now is a good time
for me to let you know...

...that I asked your daughter
to marry me.

Surprise.

He asked me last night.

Got down on one knee and told me
that he couldn't live without me.

Sister, you're going to marry this man?

He disrespects our home,
the reverend.

Oh, he's a comedian.
He was just trying to make us laugh.

He's a really good man.

Even goes to church sometimes.

Granted, it is for material,
but I am there...

-...and God knows my heart.
Stop.

I got a good heart.
Stop.

He tithes.

Child, I think enough of you
to introduce you...

...to dentists and doctors
and accountants.

But, no, not you.

You want to whore with this coon.

Mom!
Sparkle.

Ms. Anderson,
I'm probably more of a Sambo.

I coon from time to time,
but Sambo's my go-to.

Baby, think more of yourself.

I know you're worried about getting older
and who's gonna marry you.

But get older, not desperate!

Desperate?

I'm doing a whole lot better
than you ever did.

Just keeping a man
is a whole lot better than you ever did.

Ladies, please. I think--
No, no, no, Reverend.

Let her get her attention.
She doesn't have much else.

Maybe this is a conversation--
Me getting a husband is not about me.

It's about her. It's not my fault
that she got knocked up at 16...

...and is trying to convince folks
she's the perfect mother...

...raised some good girls.
Sparkle's gonna follow up behind you...

...and be a little church mouse
and make dresses.

And if she's lucky,
she'll be a preacher's wife.

Dee's gonna be a doctor,
and I'm just supposed to marry one?

Funny thing is,
maybe I could have snagged one...

...if you'd sent me to school
like these two.

But instead, I was at home,
raising your kids...

...while you were laid up
in your own vomit.

Sister...

...if you gonna tell my tragic story...

...give me the honor
of getting it correct.

Yeah, I passed out a few times.

Sure, I've had my moments.

But you've never, ever, ever
seen me laying in my own vomit.

Whatever you say, Mama.

The fact is, I was desperate back then.

Right now,
I'm trying to get myself out of here...

...and get myself more than
a color TV and half a room.

It's okay.

Well, we better go.

Ms. Anderson, thanks for what looked like
could have been a great dinner.

We better go.

Sister!

You leave my house,
there's no coming back.

Not this time.

Sparkle. Sparkle!

Are you still gonna be
part of the group?

That's not exactly
what was on my mind, Spark.

Yeah, sure.

Dee, say something.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Come here.

I love you, Spark.

It's okay.

Where you want to go?

Anywhere.

Close your eyes.

Okay, you can open them.

Your cup of coffee, sir.

I appreciate it, baby.

You know, Daddy got to wake up
a little faster and a little stronger.

You'll be surprised with
what this gonna do when we make love.

Can't be any better than it already is.

Are you catching a cold?
No, I'm fine.

Okay, from "You bring out
the woman in me."

Five, six, seven, eight.

Can you not hit my hand every time?

Okay, come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.

Y'all ain't got to go home...

...but you know the rest.

Oh, they were just leaving.

Baby, you got some
cab fare for them?

Cab fare?

You the one opening for
Aretha Franklin.

I mean, hell, if I had any sense,
I'd be living off your ass.

I'm funny, Sparkle? I'm funny?
Yeah.

So you laughing at me
like them white folks that I coon for?

No.
Satin.

Well, you should.

That's how I'm paying
for all this heat you sucking up.

Satin, I'm just--
Let's just go. Come on, just go.

Grab your book.

Ready for TV, Ms. Sparkle?

Oh, my God, Ms. Franklin!

Hello.

Today ain't the day
to be fashionably late.

You're fine.

Stix says Ms. Franklin's not here.
Running late.

I'm worried because that's gonna
cut it close to us getting home.

Sure is.

Do you have any more pins?

I'm running out of mine over here
and I need some more.

I can't get this thing on.

What happened to your face?

Oh, it ain't nothing.

He did that to you, didn't he?

I had an accident.

Oh, so, what,
you tripped and hit his fist?

Get out.

Excuse me?

I told you to get out of my face.

He's beating you,
and you're taking it out on me?

Just go. Go! Get out!
No!

I don't need to hear this.

Jeez, she's always in my business!
Somebody ought to be!

Shut up.
You guys, stop. Don't do this!

Not tonight.

Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

We have to open up for
Aretha Franklin tonight, right?

Right?
Right.

Well, Sister can't fly on one wing.
