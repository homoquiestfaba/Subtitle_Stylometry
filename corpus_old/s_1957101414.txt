looking good for the area.</i>

<i>Sunny skies on tap from Brentwood
all the way north to Richmond</i>

<i>and throughout the state of Virginia,
with highs reaching 85 degrees.</i>

<i>Low tonight, about 65.</i>

<i>Should be a great weekend
for hikers to get out and enjoy...</i>


[car door closes]

Pretty girl.

You must be one proud papa.

Who's the Black fella?

Darius Clemmons. It's her boyfriend.

They were traveling
with a group of their friends.

Well, the Appalachian Trail's
a hefty piece of real estate.

I mean, Maine clear down to Georgia way.

I've been tracking their route,

and she promised to call
or text every week.

And it's been six weeks.

The last place that she
texted me was here in your town.

[soft chuckle]

Well, the fact is we get a shit-ton
of kids that come through here.

I mean, they come, and they do
whatever it is they do, and they move on.

My boy's down in Tampa
playing keyboard in some rockabilly band.

I can't remember the last time
that boy picked up a phone.

My daughter's not like that.

Well, we can make it official
if you'd like.

Fill out this missing persons report.

Be as detailed as you'd like.

But if I were to put money on it,

I'd say she's somewhere
sunning herself in the Keys.

I rarely see them leave.

Most are gone by sun up,
trying to catch flights or beat traffic.

left in the room?</i>

<i>No. And their car was gone.</i>

<i>Okay, well,</i>

if you think of anything,
please give me a call, yeah?

My name's Scott.

You spoke to the police chief?

Yeah.

I didn't sense much urgency from him.

This is a quiet town.

<i>The quieter it is,
the more he gets to fish.</i>

[Jen, over voicemail]
<i>Hey, it's Jen.</i>

<i>Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.
Thanks, bye.</i>

<i>Look again. Please.</i>

<i>No, sorry, no.</i>

You know how many tourists
come through here?

I remember drinks, not faces.

Lose something?

My daughter.

Her name is Jennifer.

She passed through here
with five of her friends.

They're all about the same age.

Yeah, I seen 'em.

Goddamn yuppies.

You didn't happen to notice
which way they went?

North, maybe.

Up on the AT.

But if they got lost in them woods,
you might as well just go on home,

'cause you ain't never gonna find 'em.

Yeah, well...

I don't believe that. I can't.

Believe what you want, mister.
But know this...

Out there,

nature eats everything it catches
right down to the bone.

Doesn't give a shit if it's a cute girl.

Do you have kids?

What would you do?

[door opens and closes]

[camera shutters clicking]

[pop music playing on radio]

What do you think of this one?

Yeah, it's-it's fine.

Adam, come on.
What? What the fuck?

I need that.
[Milla] I want to show you the picture.

[Adam] Give me my phone.
[Milla] No!

Hey. Babe, you're fine.

Just breathe.

Open your mind.

Enjoy it, okay?

Look at that one.
Is that how sad I look all the time?

Yes, you do, actually.

I must really love you.

You really do.
It's-it's weird how much you love...

You're weird.

Now kiss me.

[loud pop]
[tires screech]

Whoa!
Ah!

You know, uh,
you're making me look bad.

Sorry.
Don't be. Fucking girl power.

[camera clicks]
Girl power.

learn how to do this?

My dad.

He taught me two things:

How to bait a hook
and how to change a tire.

My dad taught me how to put in a tampon.

Single parent.

His eyes were closed the whole time.

Not a good experience.

Uh...

[heavy breathing]

Oh.

Oh, here we go.
[Jen] Sweet.

Jen, Jen, Jen.

My fucking hero.

It's quaint.

Yeah, especially if you miss
the good old days of the Confederacy.

All right.

This one's mine.

That's yours, babe.
[Darius] Trying to grab yours.

Pass me mine.

[car doors close]

Three rooms for two nights.
Yes.

Policies of the inn
are posted in your rooms.

No alcohol on the patio.

No candles in the room,
no loud music or raucous activity.

Hear that, boys? Behave yourselves.

Thanks. And don't worry.
I'll keep them on a short leash.

Have you been here before?

First time.
Just doing a little hiking.

Piece of advice,
keep to the marked trail.

The land here can be unforgiving.

Thanks. We'll be careful.

[rock music playing]

[indistinct chattering]

You know that a bunch of abolitionists
came from this town?

Darius loves that shit.
Fucking history, baby.

Back when people actually fought
for what they believed in.

what was that thing earlier?

Why wouldn't you hold my hand?

Nothing. No reason.

Oh, there's a reason.

Same reason Darius is on edge.

Adam.
Dude.

What? He's a Black dude
with a White girlfriend

in bum-fuck Virginia.

Hey.

Y'all ain't from around here, are you?

What gave us away?

Uh, yeah.

We're just, uh, checking out
the Appalachian Trail.

Couple days of hiking.
Nothing extreme.

There's something dangerous up there.

So if you got any questions
or you need a guide,

me and my pals over here,
we, uh, we know this land

like the back of our hands.

Thanks. Thanks. I think we're good.

It's your life.

But, uh, if you change your mind...

we'll always be around.

Driving around in a shitty pickup,
sipping moonshine, am I right?

Stop it.
[snickers]

What'd you say, peckerwood?

Excuse my fiancÃ©.

He forgets that talking to people
isn't like commenting on Reddit.

Don't look at me, boy.

You goddamn hipster freaks
are the problem with this whole world.

I'm betting not a goddamn one of you

ever worked a real fucking job
in your life.

So you better sit the fuck still
and behave yourself.


Jen.

My boyfriend, Darius,
runs a sustainable energy nonprofit.

Milla's an oncologist.
Adam's an app developer.

And Gary and Luis own a pair
of New York bistros.

I don't know. I'd call those real jobs.

And what about you, sweetheart?

I have two master's.

Art history and dance.

Which means I make coffee for a living.


But right now I'm looking at you,

and I'm seeing some
yellowing in your eyes.

Which means what, Milla? Hmm?

Oh, um, it could be liver problems.

Jaundice, hepatitis, Gilbert syndrome.

You should probably
see a doctor, actually.

All right, well...

you kids be safe.

Maybe we'll see you again.

[sighs]
Seriously, do not do that ever again.

I can't handle that.
Dude, why do we let you drink?

Because usually I'm very funny.

No, actually, you have never,
ever been funny.

Like, never.

Where are the drinks?

[rock song playing]

You know this song.

Do you know this?

No, but it's a good song.

Okay, people, 8:00 a.m.

Luis, Gary, I'm talking to you.

Okay, I'm not a morning person.

If I don't get my eight hours,
I will be a zombie.

[Milla] Be a zombie who hikes.
[Darius] Hey, guys.

Guys.
[Milla] What?


Is that one of those assholes
from the bar?

Yeah, probably.

Hey.
[Darius] Adam.

Relax.
[Adam] Hey!

Get away from the car, man.

Get away from there. Shoo.

He's not a dog.
Yo!

Are you deaf or something?
Back the fuck off!

Jesus, Adam, are you trying
to piss off everyone in Middle America?

You gotta be tough with these people.

Okay, big guy, time for bed.

Come on.
Back me up here.

Adam.

Come on, forget about it.

Where the hell did that guy go?

[phone line ringing]
[Milla] Come on.

[Scott, on voicemail]
<i>Hi. This is Scott.</i>

<i>Leave a message and I'll get
right back to you. Thank you.</i>

[voicemail beeps]
[Jen] <i>Hey, Dad. Sorry to call so late.</i>

We're still hiking the Appalachian Trail.

When I get back,
I promise I'll give you an answer

about what I plan to do.

I love you.

Say hi to Corinne.

Maybe she'll say hi back for a change.

Okay, talk soon.

Bye.

<i>So is Adam right?</i>

<i>Are you on edge?</i>

We can go home right now.

Hey, nice try,
but you don't have to protect me.

You know why I work in nonprofit
instead of on Wall Street?

Because...

I want to build a community
where people are valued

on their skills and their character.

Not their bank account
or their skin color.

Everyone works.

Everyone shares.

I'd give anything for that.

I know.

That's why I love you.

These are beautiful.
Did you make all this?

Some.

Hey.

I'm Jen. What's your name?

[laughs]
Don't mind Ruthie.

She don't like to talk.

I was shy too at her age.

Is she yours?
In a manner.

It takes a village to raise a child,
isn't that what they say?

How much?

Ten dollars.

[zipper opens]

[Jen laughs]

Thanks.


I've literally never seen you wear this.

Wow. Wow.
Okay.

[indistinct chattering]

Yeah!


Walk of shame.

Me and Gary are going on a hike.

I didn't know that you were filming.

Yeah, it's for a YouTube video.

Catch me.

[all laughing]

Oh, my God! Help!

[indistinct chatter]

Oh, it's beautiful. Nature.

Is anyone still drunk from last night?

[all laughing]
[Gary] Bitch, I am.

That last shot was a bad idea.


or are we going this way?

Do you have signal on your phone?

No.

[all laughing]

[Jen] I can do that.
[Darius] I've been horrible.

[Adam] Look at that.
This is fucking awesome!

[all laughing]

Whoo!

It's up here.

Okay?

[no audio]




[indistinct chattering]

Okay, quick little side trip, guys.

[Jen] What?
There's supposed to be

a very well-preserved
Civil War fort near here.

Cool. Let's find it.

Um, the woman at the inn
said we shouldn't leave the trail.

It's just a quick look around.

Babe, if we don't find anything,
we'll just cut back over to the trail.

You know what we wouldn't have found
if we would have stayed on the trail?

Hmm? The waterfall.

And that cliff, hmm?

Come on. We'll be good.

Okay.
Okay?

[laughs]
She said yes!

[Jen] Whoo! Whoo!
[Gary] Let's do it.

They getting married?





[Adam] A snake.
[Milla] Oh, my God.

[Milla gasps]

[Adam] You okay?
Yeah.


[Jen] Shit. Yeah, thanks.
Fuck.

[camera clicks]

Ah!
[all scream]

You okay?
Uh-huh.

Dar, how much longer
is this gonna take?

Look, it's just a little further, okay?
I promise, okay?

Please.

You okay?
No!

We got to keep going.

for fucking hours.

That's what we've been doing.

way more than an hour.

What are you talking about?
It's been like four hours.

[Gary] Four hours?
[Adam] No, I mean...

I mean, since we passed that thing.

You know what?

Why don't you guys
just, um, just head back to the trail.

I'll meet you guys up there.

[wood cracking distantly]

What is that?

[gasps]
Oh, my God! Adam!

Oh, my God!
Go, go, go, go, go.

[log rumbling]






[loud crash]


Adam?

Milla. Hey.


You left me.

What?
You left me.

I know. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

I was freaking out.
I didn't know what I was doing.

You left me!
I know. I'm sorry.

You left me!

Please, don't do that again!

[panting]
[Adam] I'm so sorry, okay?

Come here.

Oh, fuck.

Jen? Jen?

Jen! Jen!

Are you okay?


Are you okay?
Yeah.

Oh, my God, Darius! Your finger!

Oh, fuck!


We're okay. Oh, fuck.

Where's Luis and Gary?

Huh?



Luis. Luis, man. Get out of here.

Come on. Let's go over here. Come on.

No, no, no, no.

No, no! No!
Let's go over here.

Do not fucking touch me!

Okay.


No, no, no.

Oh, fucking shit.


We need to call for help.

I can't... I can't find my phone.

I can't find my phone. Help me find it.

Oh, fuck. No service.

We need to go to higher ground.

I'm going to climb up
and try and make a call.

There's no way we're going to go
back up there, okay?

I'll find a way around.
What fucking way around?

Not by yourself.
Jen... this is my fault.

It goddamn is.
It is your goddamn fault!

[all shouting]

Luis! Hey! Hey!

It's nobody's fault, okay?
Did Darius make the tree fall?

Look at me.
Did Darius make the tree fall? No.

This is fucking awful, okay?
But it's nobody's fault, okay?

[Luis sobbing]

Luis, I'm sorry, man!
I'm fucking sorry, man!

I'll go by myself. I'll go right now.

We all have to go.

[Darius] Why?
[sobs] I can't leave him.

[thunder rumbles]

If it rains,
which it looks like it's about to...

we're exposed out here, guys.

This slope's not safe.

I think... I think someone's up there.

[Darius] What?
[Jen] Someone's up there.

[Darius] I don't... I don't see anyone.
[Jen] Where are they?

I saw someone. I did.
I-I saw someone.

This is so fucked up.


It's okay.

Fuck this. Fuck this!

[bone cracks]
[whimpers]

You okay?

[clears throat]

Thanks.

No problem.

He won't be here long.


So I will.

We're lost!

Just admit it, Darius.

No fucking clue where we are.
Hey. Hey. We're fine.

We're-we're cutting across the mountain,

and eventually,
we'll hit the AT on the other side.

But I think that we can probably
camp out for the night.

I'm not leaving Gary
out there in the woods overnight

for animals and insects
and whatever the fuck!

That's not Gary anymore.

Luis, that was his body.

His spirit's moved on.

That's what he believed, right?

He's in paradise now. He's happy.

Come here, man.
[Luis sobs]

Okay?

Okay.

[thunder rumbles]

Can you pull this?

[rain pattering]

[thunder crashes]

[birds tweeting]

Oh, fuck.

Thank God it stopped raining.

Where's Milla?

Hmm?

I-1 didn't feel her get up.

She probably went somewhere to pee.

Milla?


Jesus.

We've been sleeping in a graveyard.


What?

Look at this.

This is a declaration pledge
to the foundation of America.


Long live slavery.

Uh, no, actually, this is...
dated before the war.

"November 24, 1859."

There's like a dozen families listed here,

pledging their lives
and their-their children's lives.

Hey, did one of you take my phone?

Um... no.

Maybe you dropped it yesterday
when everything was happening.

in my pack last night.


Did Milla come back?
[Luis] No.

Hey, do you have your phone?
What?

[patting pants]

Shit.

Where's our fucking phones?


What the fuck is going on?

I thought I saw somebody
outside the tent last night.

[Darius] What?
What?

When?
[Jen] In the middle of the night.

Just for a second.

Could have just been
shadows from the trees.

Fuck!

You guys, help me... Help me find Milla.

Adam...
[Jen] I'm sure she's fine.

You thought you saw someone
after the tree fell,

and then again last night,
and now our fucking phones are gone.

They're probably fucking
watching us right now!

No, no, no, no, I promised her
that I wouldn't fucking leave her again.

I fucking promised her that.

Hey, Adam! Adam!


Milla!

[Jen] Milla!
[Darius] Milla!

Milla!

Milla?

[Luis] Milla!
[Adam] Milla!

Milla!

Milla!

Hey.


What are you doing out here?
[Adam] Milla!

Who's that?

I saw her in town.

I think her name's Ruthie.

In town?

Hey!

Hey. Sorry.

Come here.
Why don't you come here for a second.

Adam.
[Adam] I just wanna ask you something.

No, you see this girl, and now she's here
out of fucking nowhere, and Milla's gone?

You think that this is a coincidence?

No fucking way.
Calm down.

I fucking warned you
about these white-trash hillbillies.

Hey!
Adam! Stop!


Hey! Hey!

[Jen] Adam!
Hey!

Stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey.


Adam.

[Adam groaning]

No, no, no, no, no!
Don't let her get away!

Dar, go on after her!
[Jen] No, wait!

What?

Guys? Guys, what is that?

My foot's caught on something.

What the hell is that?

Guys! Whoa!

What the hell is this?

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Darius!

What's going on? Guys?
[Jen] Darius, help!

What? What?

[Adam screaming]



No, no, no, no, no, no!


Can you hear me?

Adam!
Do you see him?

[breathing heavily] No.

Uh, I-I feel a draft.

Luis, grab my legs.

Lower me in, okay?


Adam!

Adam...

Adam.

Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit!


Darius, this is crazy. We need help.

Look, if I can get that snake
out of there,

maybe I can reach Adam, okay.
[Jen] And do what?

He's still caught on that chain.
What if he's hurt?

Maybe this hole connects
to an old mine or something.

We can look for an entrance, and then...

Okay, how long do you want to look?
An hour? Two? All day?

That chain goes somewhere!

I know! Somebody put it there.

Do you hear what I'm saying?

We need to get the fuck
off this mountain and get help.

No phones. No GPS.

How are we supposed to find
our way back here, huh?

Jen, what the hell are you doing?

Let's go.

What is this place?

for the whole mountain.

I think maybe Adam
was right about these people.

We should go.


Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.


Those hunters from town?
I don't know.

I-I can't...

That's Adam.

That's Adam.

[blade unsheathes]


Hey, hey. Put him down right now.

Put him the fuck down!

[speaks in foreign language]

Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't understand.

[speaking foreign language]

Speak English.

Oh, my God, Adam.
Is he dead?


Where's our friend?
Did you take her? Did you?

Did you kill her? Answer me!

Where is she? What'd you do?
Did you fucking take her? Hey!

I will fucking kill you! Back up!

Get the fuck back!

What did you do with her?

Where is she? Where the fuck is she?

[speaking foreign language]
I can't fucking understand you.

Speak English! Speak English!

[overlapped shouting]


You killed her! You killed her!
You killed her!


Adam! Adam!
You killed her!

Hey, hey, hey.
[Darius] Adam, Adam.


Adam, Adam, Adam. Shit.

[Adam whimpers]
[Darius] Shit.

[Adam] Where's the other one?
[Darius] Oh, shit.

He's gone.

Oh, my God.

I had to.

They...

They killed Milla. They...

They killed her.

Adam.

Adam.
Oh, my God.


What the hell's going on here?
What's going...?

What is that?
What the fuck is going on?

Fuck.

What the fuck is that, guys?

What happened?

You're alive.

Yes. I'm alive. What is this?

Where have you been?

I left to go pee. I was in the woods.

I saw these two huge guys.
They were... they were dressed like this.

So I hid in the bush.

We went looking for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

or else they'd hear me.

By the time they left, you had all gone.

Babe, what happened to you?
I thought you were dead.

Milla, we thought that they'd taken you,

or-or-or killed you or something.

Did you just kill this man for no reason?

No-no reason?

They dragged me into a fucking hole,

trussed me up
like a goddamn Christmas turkey.

Who knows what they were
going to do to me?

All we know for sure
is that you just killed someone.

They were going to kill me, okay?

Look at him. He's a...
He's a fucking animal.

He's right. Listen, listen.

There's one fucking dead guy
on the ground, the other one left.

We don't know how many more there are.

We have to get the fuck
off of this mountain, right?

What about the body?

Yeah, what about it?
I mean, we left Gary.

Yeah. When we get back to town,
we'll let the fucking police

handle this shit.
No, fuck that.

No way. I-I-I am not turning myself over
to some redneck judge.

No, fuck that.
We-we-we were never here.

We were never here.

So we just walk away from this?

Yes.

What about the other one? He saw us.

Oh, the other one.
The really friendly-looking one

with the skull mask
that was... that was speaking tongues?

Yeah, I'm sure he's a regular
at city council meetings.

Dude, listen. Hey, hey, listen.
[Adam] They were gonna kill me!

Listen, okay, I get it.
They didn't kill Milla.

But the-the-the snare trap
and the lumber mill, right?

And Adam tied to a fucking log?
Yes, yes.

I mean, who fucking knows?
They probably killed Gary.

Like, these are clearly not good people.

We got to get the fuck out of here, guys.

Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on.



Once we find a stream,
we can follow it down the mountain.

Why don't we just go straight down?

You want to take a header off a cliff?
Be my guest.

Okay, you don't have to be
a fucking bitch about it. I get it.

It's my fault. I should've
announced I was leaving to go pee.

[Adam] It's okay. Forget it.
[Darius] Fuck.

We should've grabbed some
of that climbing gear we saw.

No, it's good we didn't touch
anything, right? No traces?

If we've done nothing wrong,
we have nothing to hide.

Jesus, fucking quit it
with the morality police bullshit, Jen.

You're clueless about what you want

for your own blessed
all-American white girl life,

and yet you know exactly
what's right for everybody else?

That's not what I'm saying.
Really?

Do we honestly not know
what's right and wrong here?

What's right for you
has nothing to do with anyone else.

What's right should be right, period.

[Adam] Look...
It's not for you to say.

The guy's dead. It's over.

We're not talking about it
to anybody, all right?

Whatever.

just shut up and relax?

Let's see if we can make that happen.

Fuck.

Jesus Christ.


Are you okay? Are you okay?

Another fucking trap.

Still think these people aren't monsters?


You're lucky you didn't tear an artery.


Must've stepped on something
to trigger it.

Fuck this place.

Thanks... again.

You're welcome. Again.

[Darius laughs]
[Milla] Good as new.

[grunts and sighs]

Let's go.


Luis?


Luis?
Luis?

Oh, my God.

Luis?
Luis?

[twig snaps]
[Jen] Luis?

Guys?

Oh, God, it's them.

It's them.


Guys, it's them.

There's nobody there, man. Relax. Relax.
Guys?

No, it's fucking them!
We have to go right now. We have to go!

Adam!
Wait, no, Milla.

Oh, shit.

Run. Run!

Run, run, run.
[Milla] Adam!

Go, go, go, go, go, go.

Adam!



Oh, shit.

Adam, help me.
Milla.

Holy shit.

Milla.

Get me out of here.
Oh, my God.

Uh, okay.

[Milla] Help.
Oh, shit.

[gasps]
[wails]

Milla.


[sobbing]
[Adam] Shit. Shit.

Fuck.

I'll be right back.
No, don't.

I'm gonna get some help.
I'll be right back.

No, you can't do this again!
I'm just going to go get help.

I'm going to be back, okay?
Don't leave me! Look at me!

Fucking look at me!

Fuck.
No! Fuck you!

You promised me you would never leave me.


Help me.

Help me.

Help me.

[arrow thuds]




[muffled screams]


[Darius grunts]


[breathing heavily]



[both panting]

What the fuck was that?

Ah!
Darius!

Darius! Darius!

Darius?

[distant shrieking]




Good morning.

You're late. And you're carpool today.

I know.
I have class.

I got a meeting in Saddle River
with a roofer

and a concrete guy in Millburn.

Hey.
Hey.

You haven't heard from Jen, have you?
Why would she call me?

Because you're her mom.
Don't say "mom."

She hates that. Get your stuff.
You have one minute.

Jenny, it's your dad.

I'm, uh, just calling again
to see how you're doing.

I hope you're having fun
with your friends.

<i>Listen, I'd love to talk to you
about that offer.</i>

<i>You'd get your own office
and your own coffee maker</i>

<i>with all the perks.</i>

<i>Excuse the pun. [chuckles]</i>

<i>Anyhow...</i>

don't forget to call me, all right?

It's been a couple weeks now, and...

I'd love to hear your voice.

Please, give me a call.

Thank you. I love you. Bye.

Weird.

It went to voicemail again.

[door closes]

Want to know why she doesn't call?

Jennifer went off to find herself,

which is a choice she made
to avoid making a choice.

Look, how about you focus
on my boys, our boys?

[laughs]
For once.

Yeah.
Please?

[breathing softly]

[gasps softly]

[breathing heavily]

Help!

Help! Somebody, please!

Help me!

Stop your screaming,
or you'll suffer for it.

You. I know you.

Help me. Please help me.

Do you want food? Water?

Yes.
Then shut your mouth.

Understand?

Please, please, please, let me go.

Please. You met me in town, remember?

You and the little girl? Ruthie?
You don't want to listen.

No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I'm sorry!

I'm sorry. Please.


Please!


This isn't happening!


[breathing heavily]

Milla?

Walk.

[goats bleating]

[hammer pounding]

[doors creak closed]

What the...?

Walk.

Kneel.

I'm done with this bullshit.

Kneel.

Fuck you.


Jesus. They'll kill you, man.

Stay down.

Stay back.

[gavel bangs]

Oh, God.

This is court.

You are on trial.

Trial? For what?

Murder.

This is bullshit!
We didn't murder anybody!

Only you will speak.

If you have questions,
my daughter will answer.

[speaks foreign language]

[all chanting in foreign language]

You-you can't put us on trial.
This-this isn't a court of law.

The law is the law.

There's only truth and lies.

This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

It's fucking insane!

The next one who speaks
out of turn loses their tongue.

[speaking foreign language]

Hobbs.

I saw each of them,
in town and on the mountain.

That one threw a bottle at me.

[Darius] No, no.
[Jen] Jesus, Adam.

He says vile words about us.

He hates us.

Morgan.

Morgan...

tell us what you saw.

[speaking foreign language]

Samuel...

[speaking foreign language]

W-w-what is he saying?

"My brother, Samuel,
and I were out hunting."

[speaking foreign language]

"Stalking moose and elk
for the winter larder."

"We were checking our game traps
in the cave where caught game is dragged

to keep predators from getting to it."

[Adam screaming]

Ah!
[Jen] Adam!

[speaking foreign language]

this stranger instead.â€

"He was hurt, knocked out.
We were taking him down the mountain."

"Planned to leave him
where he'd be found..."

"When these others attacked us."


[speaking foreign language]

"He killed my brother Samuel."

No. We didn't know.

They were wearing skulls,

and their bodies were covered
with leaves and blood.

What we wear when we go hunting, huh?

To hide our scent and our faces
from our prey.

Your hunters do the same.

Hmm?

Did he do what Morgan has accused?

Did this man murder
Morgan's brother, Samuel?

Lie, and dread will fall on each of you.


Speak true.

No.

He didn't murder him.


Ruthie.

Ruthie, who killed Samuel?


You lied to this court.

No, no.

Adam feared for his life.

He killed this man in self-defense.

It's not murder.

We thought they were kidnapping him.

We thought they were taking him
somewhere to kill him.

Why? Why did you think this?

What proof did you have?

Had you met any of our people?

Had we caused you any harm?!

This court finds you guilty of murder.

The sentence is death.
[Adam] What?

No, no, no, I didn't...
It was a mistake.

I didn't know what they were doing.

It's not my fault!


Get back.

You want this kid to join your brother?

Then back the fuck off!

Adam, Adam, no.

Shut up.
[Darius] Hey, hey, Adam.

If you hurt her, you make things
worse for all of us.

Look around, Dar.
This shit's already worse.

Okay, this is what you're gonna do.

You're going to untie my friends,
and then you're going to let us go.

I'm not afraid of you!

I just want to get as far away
from you backwoods fucks

as I possibly can.

Now, move.

I look in your eyes.

I see only fear.

There's no future for men like you.

Fuck you!


I was wrong to call you a man.

[Adam screaming]

The rest of you are guilty
for bearing false witness.

The sentence is darkness.

What? No, no, no. Please, please.

Take them.
[Jen] Please, please, no.

Please, no! No!

[Darius screaming]

Jen! Jen!

<i>Jen!</i>




[speaking foreign language]

[all chanting in foreign language]

This family is owed retribution.

How was Samuel murdered?

Say the words.

How was Samuel murdered?

He was struck in the head.

[muffled protests]




No, don't do this.

Don't do this, please.

Please. It's wrong.

It's barbaric.

Listen to me, listen to me.

We can help you.

We'll do anything.

We can get you money...
Barbaric?

Hmm?

Our families built this place.

Men and women of all races and creeds

came here to avoid the Armageddon
they knew was coming between the States.

We have everything we need.

Everyone works.
Everyone contributes.

Our food is fresh and plentiful.

We have no cancer, no poverty, no war.

No one hates another
because they have while another doesn't.

We are one body working together.

[shouts in foreign language]

[chanting in foreign language]

You tell me, whose world is more barbaric?

[Jen breathing heavily]

No!

[blows thudding]
[all gasp]

[Luis sobbing]

Take them.


Here, you will see no evil,

hear no evil, speak no evil.

[blade rings]


[cries]
No!


Oh, no!

No, wait. Please, no.

Jen!

No! No!

[screams and sobs]
[sizzling]

Ah! Don't!

Darius! Darius, help me!

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

No! Help me! No! Please!

Please, dear God. Please don't.

No! No!

[sizzling]
[Luis shrieks]

Fuck off.

[breathing heavily]


Listen to me.

You're making a mistake.

You're wasting valuable resources...

What are we wasting?

Us.

Us. Us.

You-you have us.

Use us.

Darius works in nonprofit.

He works in sustainable energy.
What the hell are you doing?

He's designed homes, neighborhoods,
communities to be self-sufficient.

We're already self-sufficient.

No, but you need maintenance,
improvements.

You suffer storm damage, climate changes.

Springs dry up. You need problems solved.

That's what he does.

That's his skill.

That's what he can contribute.

You do this, you lose all of that.

Standard says you're strong.

You have a warrior spirit.

I don't give up.

And what of you?

What do you offer?

Myself.

There's no sickness in my family.

No cancer.

I'm young, healthy.

I'll have strong, healthy children.

Who among your men needs a wife?


[Darius gasping]

Open your mouth.


Shut up.

Spread your legs.

Spread your legs.



[blade rings and sizzles]

Are you prepared to become
a loyal citizen?

Yes.

Are you prepared to become
a loyal citizen?

Yes.

If you run, you should know
there's no safe way off this mountain.

If our traps don't kill you,
the animals will.

If the land doesn't kill you,
our people will.

If you don't contribute...
you'll end up here.

Do you understand?

Yes.

Yeah. Yeah.

[gasps]
[blade sizzling]

Please don't hate me.


<i>Vee nor.</i>

<i>Vee nor.</i> What...?

"Friends?"

Does that mean "friends?"

[laughs]
[man grunts]

Come with me.

[door creaks open]


She died in a fall.

Here, people die
of either accidents or old age.

Can we ever leave?

Why would you want to?

I know about life below.

You're alone.

People come to the mountains
looking for something.

Something to remind them
that life is worth living.

You came looking for something.


And now you've found it.

You're not as strong as you pretend to be.

[phone line ringing]

[Jen, over voicemail]
<i>Hey, it's Jen.</i>

<i>Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.</i>

<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

[computerized voice]
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

<i>and cannot accept any messages
at this time. Goodbye.</i>

[phone rings]

Hi.

<i>No. I don't know.</i>

<i>Maybe a couple more days.</i>

<i>I'm waiting to hear back
from the local police before I move on.</i>

I know.

She's, uh... she's missing.

[country music playing]


Hello.

I'm sorry about your daughter
and her friends.

[waitress] Double whiskey.
Thank you.

I told her to stay on the trail.

There are people living on that mountain.

What people?

The Foundation.

The Foundation?

It's a story people here know
but don't talk about,

except in whispers.

Like a ghost story.

Oh.

In 1859, a dozen or so families
packed up and fled up the mountain.

They feared the collapse of America,
and wanted to protect their way of life.

They said when America fell,

they would be the foundation
on which a new nation would be built.

And these descendants of these people

are still living up there on the mountain?

We don't bother them,
and they don't bother us.

But anyone who goes up there,
they don't come back...

alive or dead.

And you know this how?

It's happened before.

But if it's happened before,

why hasn't someone
done something about it?

Because...

it's made to look like they left.

I'm sorry.


You just don't listen, do you, mister?

Your girl is dead,
and you don't want to find what's left.

She's not dead.

[all grunting]

Oh, you son of a...

[siren chirps]

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

Hey.

Hey!

No, no, no.

No! No!

Get him up.
Hey!

You son of a bitch.


Oh, shit.

What are you doing?

What does it look like I'm doing?

You don't want to go up there.

She's my daughter. I'm gonna find her.

Scott...

And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

Jesus. What happened?

Whatever happened to you
is nothing compared to what they'll do.

Wait.

I could help you.

[car doors open and close]

This him?

Yes.

Ed, this is Mr. Shaw.

Ed's my nephew. He's a hunter.

You get in a car wreck or something?

Or something.

You got the money?


[trunk closes]

Okay.

We'll see you in the morning, then.


We go now.

You got gear?

Can't go up there
dressed for no ladies' tea.

You need glasses?

Backpack, sleeping bag, poles.

Okay, okay, okay. Coop.

Toss me my go bag.

I got everything you need in there.

Why don't you go and take that
yellow jacket off your back.

Look like a fucking bull's-eye
walking around.

Give the keys to Aileen.

She'll park your car outside the inn,

make it look like
you been there all night.

Hey, let me ask you a question.

Why'd you agree to do this?


Got a son here I want to send
through welding school,

and I ain't got no love
for them Foundation fuckers.

Arrow did that.

Nineteen stitches.

A warning shot across the old brain pan
to keep off of their mountain.

Wouldn't mind returning the favor.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay back.

Stake trap.

Sneaky motherfuckers.

Get out of the creek.

like to set traps like these

to drive strangers up off the mountain.

There's a second set further up
where I got my trophy.

What comes after the second set?

Strangers don't get to leave.

You walk where I walk.


Jesus.

How much further?

There's a steep trail up along this ridge.

I won't lie, though.
It's a bitch of a hike.

But it shortcuts us right up
to the bastards' front door.


Cooper! Cooper!

Cooper, you hurt?

Are you all right?

I think I twisted my ankle.

Christ. Come on, help me pull him out.

Okay, give me your hand.

[Cooper groans]





Come on.



Cooper?

Jesus.

[breathing heavily]

One step at a time.

[twigs snap]

[faint rustling]

[metal clanging]

[Scott panting]



Darius?

Uh, it's me.

Where's Jen?

What's happened to you?

What the fuck is happening?

Where's my daughter?

Stay back.


What's wrong with you people?


Jen?

Jen.

What have they done to you?

What have you done to my daughter?

Whoever you are...
this woman is not your daughter.

She's my wife.

What are you talking about?

[speaking foreign language]

[all chanting in foreign language]



We find this stranger guilty
of trespassing.

The sentence is darkness,
to be carried out at dawn.

What are you saying?

Hey... Ah!

You won't get away with this.

People will come for me.

They know where I am!

No. No one will ever come.



I'm fine.

Why?

That man is your father.

I've made my choice.



[footsteps approaching]

[thumping]
[rocks shifting]

Jen.
Shh.


You found your way up here.
Do you know a safe way back?

Okay.

Let's go.

You shot me with an arrow.

They would've killed us both.

Come on, let's go.


What is this?

Time to leave.

Why now?

Because tomorrow morning,
they're gonna kill my dad.

We need to go.

Come on.


What?

These people see me.

I belong to them.

They belong to me.

Go.

I won't stop you.

Do you really think you can
go back to your old life?

Stay close.

This gate's never locked like this.

Jen.

Ruthie.

I have to go.

Do you understand?

I know you like to sneak down
the mountain sometimes.

Do you know another way out?

Through there?

You're saying there's a way out
through there?

Do you want to come with me, Ruthie?

You can if you want to.

[door opens]

[shouts in foreign language]
[gunshot]


Let's go.


[Jen panting]


I barely made it up here in the daylight.

Shh!



[both grunting]

[Jen yelling]


Jen!

Jen!

[men shouting distantly]




Dad.

Jen?

Jen?


[yells]
[screams]


After Venable takes your eyes,
your ears, and your tongue,

I'm going to keep you for myself.

[yells]
[knife thuds]



Jen.

Jen?


[knife slicing]
[Jen panting]

Jen.

Jennifer.

All right.

[sobbing softly]

Hey.




[breathing heavily]

What do we do now?

All that matters now is the next choice.

That's what I've learned on this mountain.

That's how I've survived.

[gun clicks]

Let's go.



Told you I'd see you again.

Back the fuck up!

Whoa, wait a minute. We're here to help.

Bullshit.
And fuck you, too.

Hey, mister, I was trying
to save your life back there.

I figured a good beat down
might send your ass packing.

And you.

That yellow in my eyes...

was my liver turning on me.

You were right.

Look, I ain't got any kids.

But my nephew disappeared
in these woods six years ago.

And I never found the body.

Fucking Foundation.

I'd like to shoot every one
of those sons of bitches.

Where's your friends?

It's just us.

Well, then, let's get you
the hell off this mountain.

Come on.

Ah!

[Lloyd] Fuck!
[Scott] No, no, no!

I'll get you.
[Osborn] Where the fuck is it?

[Jen groaning loudly]



[Jen breathing heavily]

[meaty thud]

[Jen groaning]


[truck doors slam]



Get in.

[engine starts]

[glass shatters]

special recipe.

All right, suit yourself.

I want to set that footing
by tomorrow evening.

Yeah. Hi, sweetie.
Hey, Dad.

I brought you the revised blueprints

for the North Caldwell house.
Oh, you're kidding.

You didn't need to bring them
all the way down here.

I know you wanted to see them right away.

I also know you're gonna hate
the new master bath.

Well, you did warn me.

Mm-hm.

What?

Nothing. I'm just proud of you.

Thanks, Dad.

Come on.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Well, good night.

I'll see you at home.

Oh, and remember,
it's pizza and movie night,

so don't be late.

The boys picked something
with inbred cannibals?

Again?

Geez.
[laughs]

[keys rattle]
[engine starts]

[laughter]
[indistinct chatter]


[man] Oh.
[Miles] Yeah.

You can't see it from the side.


Oh, hi, hon.

Uh, meet our new neighbors,
John and Ruthie.

They're looking at the Kaplan
house down the street.

Nothing is set in stone yet.

Well, it turns out John knows Scott.


Said if I was ever in the neighborhood
to stop by and meet the family.


Yes. Very.

Are you going to put those groceries down?


this coffee is wonderful, thank you.


I'm sure Scott would love to see you.

We're having pizza.

Yes.

We would love to stay.

It's been a long drive.

Thank you.
Oh, be right back.

And I see you're eating for two.

Congratulations.

I need to use the bathroom.

Get the fuck out of my house.
[Corinne] Jen!

Put your weapon down,
or I kill your family.

I was wrong about you, Jen.

You are strong.

I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

Now it's time to come home.

What's the point? You have to kill me.


But not until our child is born.

Congratulations, Grandma.



[gasping softly]


what are you doing?

Jen?


Can you and the boys excuse us?

John's here to talk business.

Of course. Come on. Laundry.

Come on. You want pizza? Mush.

I was wrong about you, Jen.

You are strong.

I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

You let us make you strong.

That's good.

You're carrying my child, so...

time to come home.

Promise me you won't hurt them.

Ever.

You'll never come back here.

Promise, and I'll go with you.

You have my word.
