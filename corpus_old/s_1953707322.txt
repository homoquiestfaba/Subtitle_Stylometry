Hold it!

Stop!

[screams ]

No.

Get out of the way.

Get out.


[ Crashes ]



Move.

It is the tradition
at Passover

to set free a prisoner,
one chosen by the people.

You, the people of Jerusalem,
will decide.

Which of these two condemned men
do you wish to see set free,

Jesus of Nazareth
or Barabbas?


Barabbas.

Barabbas.

Barabbas. Barabbas.

Barabbas.

Barabbas.

[crown chanting]

Barabbas.

Barabbas.

Barabbas.

[chanting continues]

No.

[chanting continues]

No!

[ laughing ]

[ Clapping ]

Sorry, there's no more wine.


I'm sorry.

There's no more wine.

Woman, my time
has not yet come.

Come.

Do whatever he tells you.

Fill them with water.

Water.

What are you doing?

I'll give you half.

You can say Barabbas
took it all.

I don't betray my master.

Put it back.


Don't kill me.

Don't kill me.


Grapes, grapes,
fresh grapes off the vine.

No, I don't think so.

Well, try these then.

[ Chattering ]

Freshest ones here.

We've been here a week.

I hope not.

[ Chattering ]

Tamar.

Tamar!

I dropped my cup.

People don't
come here to drink.

Take one of my girls.

Take as many as you like.

How about you
kick everybody out?

I wanna be alone.

Choose any girl you wish.

I wanna be alone.

[shrieking ]

Everybody out.

Out. Move.

Get out.

I wanna be alone.

Out. Out.

Get out.

Move.

Everybody out.

You don't even know
what that is.

Get out. Get out.

She doesn't understand
about me.

What are you doing?

This is a brothel.

You're not even doing anything.

Get out. Out.

[ Pants ]

I wanna be alone.

You are alone, Barabbas.

Alone.

Alone.

Take Sila,
you've always liked her.

No, I want the nameless one.

What nameless one?

The one who's
frightened of me.

Frightened of you?

Everyone who knows you is--

Frightened of me?

Her, she trembles
every time she sees you.

She does--
I want the nameless one.

I am the nameless one.

Why the nameless one?

Because he asked me my name,
and I didn't give it.

But she's only a servant.

She doesn't know how to do
what you want.

She's less than worthless.

Get out.

What's your name?

Esther.

Pretty.

That's your share.

It's a pittance.

So, next time choose
a better house to rob.

[ Horse whinnies]

Barabbas, so he's alive.

They said he was
killed in Damascus.

Or in a fight in Sidon or
hung by the neck in Tiro.

You can't believe the rumors.

Barabbas always comes back.

Wherever there's a dead body,
that where I'll find

you two scavengers.

Welcome back, Barabbas.

Zealots.

So busy looking
for the messiah,

they found death instead.

Everyone in Judea is
waiting for a messiah.

They'll have to crucify
the whole land.

It might happen
sooner or later.

Under this Roman governor,
zealots are the enemies

of Rome with all
this talk of rebellion

and a messiah that's coming
to liberate them

with a sword of fire.

Well, these two won't
be doing anymore talking,

and that's what
talking gets you.

We should just kick
the Romans out.

Careful what you say.

Pilate's spies are everywhere.

The Romans control the roads,
control the caravans,

control the city,
everything there is,

the taxes and the gold,
seize the harvests,

and they're making it
difficult to steal.

Either you work
for the Romans

and break your back
for a pittance,

or you end up like them.

What do you two
want out of life?

Wine, money and whores.

Same as him, but more whores.

[ laughs I

Well, you follow me, you'll
have everything you need.

You follow me,
I'll make you rich.

Oh, wine, money and whores and
whores and whores and whores...

[ horse whinnies]

Are you the caravan master?

I am the oldest.

We come from Sunem in Galilee.

Well, if you are the master,
then the lives

of these people depend on you.

We are all children
of the same Father.

You know, I never
had the chance to meet him.

But the Lord is
with us always,

and we are under His protection.

I don't think so.

He would not had you
meet me, Barabbas.

Barabbas, <i>we</i> are traveling to
Jerusalem to offer sacrifices

in the temple.

You know, I never understood
these sacrifices.

It is the duty of
every child of this land.

How do you make a sacrifice?

One offers the victims
to the Lord in order

to obtain his benevolence.

So, you buy animals
and sheep and doves,

and you kill them?

And you waste your money
on this nonsense?

It is tradition.

Well, we're gonna
have a change of plans.

Old man, today, you give
your money to me.

But the money for
sacrifices is sacred.

Oh, I assure you, the money
will be just as sacred with me.

We are all children of God.

Please, leave us in peace.

Drop your knives or
sacrifices will be made

right here and now.


You reap what you sow.

Where is the money?

No.

Kill the woman.

[screams ]

Stop.

Stop it. Stop.

It's all here.

[ laughs I

You're very generous.

Choose any girl you wish,
even two, three,

as many as you like.

You may have her
all night if you wish.

Well, she's mine...

forever.

[ laughs I

A serving girl.

Aren't you afraid of me?

Would it make any difference?

Well, yes.

You are afraid of me.

Everyone is afraid
of Barabbas, everyone.

[gasps 1

Why not?

It's a sin.

Yeah. That's why I like it.

It would be
against God's will.

God?

Now I've lost all desire.

I don't want you or your god.

I want a drink.

Go to sleep.

As I told you, follow me and
I will make you fishers of men.

I am a fisherman,
always have been,

but I don't understand
what fishers of men means?

[ Chuckles ]

Answer me this:
what is easier,

to smile or to offend,
to hit someone

or to lend a helping hand?

You can see better from here.

In your opinion,
what pleases God more,

to offend or to smile,
to hit out

or to come in peace?

Love your neighbor
as you would yourself

because your same pain
is in the heart

of those close to you
as your same hope.

I've never had
the courage to hope.

Excuse me. I must go.

[ Marching ]

Do you know what
punishment awaits

those who lie
to the Roman governor?

I'm not on trial, am I?

That depends.

What am I accused of?

You'd better say
that you were mistaken,

that you made it all up.

I can say whatever you
would like me to say, my lord.

That's better.

But everyone in

Bethsaida--that is
where I was born.

Everyone there knows me.

They know I was born blind.

You faked being blind
in order to beg.

No.

These eyes had
never seen the light of day.

My world was made up of things
I could touch, taste.

Ask anyone in Bethsaida
who knows me.

They know how
I have lived my life.

Ask Rabbi Elazir.

He is my master
at the synagogue.

We won't ask anyone.

You are a treacherous people,
plotting our downfall,

everyone of you.

No one can give sight
to a man born blind.

You are right, my lord.

No one can do that,
but I am the exception.

And how do you think
that is possible?

I don't know.

I could hear people
talking, shouting.

I moved towards them.

"What's going on?" I said.

"What are you talking about?

Who are you talking about?"

"Jesus," they said.

But many people
are called Jesus.

Then they say,
"Jesus of Nazareth."

Had you ever heard
his name before?

No. Never.

Not as a healer?

As one who drives out demons?

No. Never.

When I came close,
someone pointed me out

to him, and then I felt
his hands on my eyes.

Enough.

You're repeating yourself.

Throw him in prison
without light.

You're used to the dark,
aren't you?


A leader sent down from heaven,

a messiah to lead
the revolt against the emperor.

If the people believe
this nonsense,

it will be the end for us.

You don't believe
in prophets, do you?

You should rest, Claudia.

When did you last have
a good sleep?

You won't answer my question.

Do you know who this child is?

It isn't the child
that I can't give you.

Not you, fate.

It was our lot, that's all.

The prophet talks of a child,
a child who will

bring light to the world.

You don't believe it, do you?

You don't believe it can happen,
that someone can

restore sight to the blind.

Claudia, you must
learn to distinguish.

I govern this land on
behalf of the Roman emperor.

You close your eyes
in order not to see.

You don't want to see.

You are blind and without hope.

I need hope.

I can't live without hope.

I will request
a transfer back to Rome soon.

We cannot live in this land
of rebels and fake prophets.

Isn't it what you
always wanted, to return home?

Not now.

I want to see with my own eyes,
to hear with my own ears.

Is this about
the Rabbi of Nazareth?

He's just one of the many
who incite the crowd against us.

Stay close to me.

I need you.

[ Horse whinnies]

You, get over that hill,
on the road to Jerusalem.

If you see Romans
or Herod's soldiers,

you'll have time to warn me.

And you, after you water
the horses,

wait and sit under
that tree, on guard.

Do you know how
to play one of these?

No.

Well, learn and keep playing
until I come out of there.

And if you stop playing,
I'll know you asleep.

And if you're asleep,
well, I'll know how to wake you.

Yeah.

[ Blows air]

[flute being played]

I brought you something.

Oh, what's the matter?

Aren't you hungry?

I take care of you, don't I?

Let me go.

Where?

To see the man of Nazareth,
to hear him speak.

He's got nothing to say.

Then you shouldn't be afraid.

Afraid?

I bought you.

I can do what I want with you.

What if you didn't come back?

Why wouldn't I come back?

What, you mean
if someone kills me?

If I die, how could you live?

What have you got there?

What is that?

Must be worth a fortune.

I pretend that
my mother left it to me.

Pretend?

I never knew her.

Like me,
I didn't know mine either.

A slave merchant raised me,
hate and fear.

I asked for bread,
he gave me stones.

I asked for water,
they whipped me.

How can you believe in God?

How can I not?

You can leave.

Go, leave.

I don't care.

Just remember, without me,
you have nothing.

You have no one.

I have God.

God.

I saw how well you were
doing with him only.

He wasn't so good to you,
was he?

Maybe He sent you to me.

Then he is a cruel God.

[ laughs I

[ Plays flute 1

[ horse whinnies]

[gasps 1

You are cleverer
than your friend.

Now, you could be
even richer and still alive.

Barabbas!


Stop.

Death is too good for you,
Barabbas.

Water to wine, Barabbas.

The Lord revealed His power.

It's almost time for us
to take up the sword and fight.

And the messiah will lead us
to victory, not you, Barabbas.

All evil and all the filth
of the world are burned

in the fires of Gahenna.

Please.

Please, don't run away.

Help me, please.

He's trapped in the fire.

He's burning.

[grunting ]

Help!

Barabbas?

I need help, a little help.

A little help, a few coins.

I need help, just a coin
or two for my friend.

He's hurt.

I have no coins with me.

How else can I help you?

I need ointments,
medicinal herbs.

You can take this.

This is too much.

Thank you.

Please, let me come with you.

It's better I go in alone.

This is no place for you.

Let me help, please.

Please.

[ Groans ]

[flies buzzing]

Burn. Burn.

Burn all the...

Burn all the evil
of the world.

Form up, form up, move!

I never would have
dreamed this land

would yield us so much.

Rome is never satisfied.

Today, two of our people
were stabbed in the back.

I was told.

They hate us more every day.

I know of an entire village
in the south burned

to the ground by your soldiers.

They were hiding zealots,
Claudia, the very same people

who would love to kill us.

I don't want you going
to the city on your own.

I'll give you an escort.

I don't need an escort.

Do you really believe
this Jesus of Nazareth

will protect you
or the god you talk

so much about?

Hope.

[flies buzzing]

What are you doing?

Leave, get away from me.

Get away from me.

Move. Move.

Why did you save me?

You're free.

You don't want me anymore?

You make me forget who I am.

You make me weak.

I don't know why.

I can't allow that.

Don't accumulate
riches in this world.

Woodworms and rust
destroy everything, and thieves

take whatever is left.

It's better to accumulate
your riches in heaven.

Thieves don't go there to steal.

Where you find your riches,
there you will

also find your heart.

We have dates and plates.

This is not enough.


Stop them!

[grunting ]


Drop your weapons.

Which of you is Barabbas?

That's him.

They killed him.

This is Barabbas.

Let the other one go.

He's the one we want.

Our leader wants to see you.

[grunting ]

Watch your enemy's eyes.

That way, you can see
if he's afraid

or about to strike.


Your eyes are telling
you you're tired.

You must mask your tiredness.

Go.

Do you know who I am?

We need money for
the war in Rome.

I took it from Rome.

It's mine.

We need more.

So go get it.

I need men like you.

You don't know who I am.

You are Barabbas.

There are so many stories
about you.

You would need a hundred lives.

Who are you really?

I am who I am.

I know what you could become.

I like being Barabbas.

It is your life,
but how will you respond

when the messiah
summons you to free our land?

Messiah is a fable
for the defeated.

I don't believe in fables.

He will believe in you
and summon you to his side.

I'll worry about that
when and if that day comes.

This is for the money
you stole for us.

It is a sign of the Essene,
my people.

The Essene?

The Essene don't fight wars.

They don't kill.

They don't seek riches.

They wait.

They wait for a man
who brings peace.

That's why I left them.

I believe in a warrior messiah
who'll lead us

to ultimate victory.

You know the way
to our camp now.

I should kill you.

I'm not afraid to die.

Give him wine and bread
and let him go.

You will return.

Maybe not.

[ Chanting ]

[ laughs I

You come back here!

His name is Licinio Tellure.

In just a few years,
he has become

one of the richest men
in all Syria.

He is the son of
a Roman general,

born and raised abroad,
and he's a big crook

like his father.

A valued client, I assume.

Huh.

Not even all my girls
are enough for him.

He has asked me for others
and he pays double.

What's he doing in Jerusalem?

He has just returned
from Leptis Magna.

They say that he and
the governor have agreed

to share their taxes,
a mountain of gold,

which he keeps in his house.

Where is Esther?

You chased her away.

Now you want her back.

Shut up. I bought her.

She's mine.

Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

She's yours and you don't know
what happened to her?

Ha.

She's the maid of
some carpenter in Nazareth.

He fools the people
with his tricks,

and she, along with other
equally crazy women,

serves him hand and foot,
cleans everything.

To think I wanted
to make her a prostitute.

[ laughs I

You should have seen
the look on their faces.

I could not tell you.

Never seen him
before in my life.

[ laughing, chattering ]

Come join us if you wish.

Barabbas, I told you
you would return.

You said you needed money.

Not for me, for the struggle.

There's a mountain of gold.

The gold of Leptis Magna.

What do you know about it?

It's amazing what you can
learn simply by listening.

Meaning what?

Take it. It's yours.

I can't do it alone.

You can't?

It's impossible.

So you need others?

I need you and your men.

We can share it equally.

And then what will you do?

More money, more wealth,
more gold?

What about you?

More wars, more weapons,
more blood?

I'm preparing the way
for he who will come.

The messiah will free us
with his sword of fire.

This is my answer.

I don't know if it is
what you seek.

Barabbas is not one of us,
but we need him as he needs us.

After that, we'll go
our separate ways.

This man is a criminal!

His hands are covered in blood.

His life is a sacrilege.

And rather than accept him
among us, we should kill him.

The fires of Gahenna
didn't work.

You want to try again?

Enough!

Give me the knife.

No one tells me what to do.

You think you're free?

I am free!

You wanna be free?

You are a slave
to the violence within you.

It serves me well enough.

That is the way
of the animal.

If you know when to stop,
then you're a man.

Didn't your father
teach you that?

My--
forget it.

It was very easy for you
to talk like that.

I never had someone
teach me anything.

I never had a father.

Then you have much to learn.

Get some sleep.

Choose the best.

Me?

You know better than I do
what we're going up against.

Well, if we wanna to get into
Licinio Tellure's villa

to steal his gold,
we have to become gladiators.

How many men will it take?

Three, not including us.

That's all?

If this works, the fewer,
the better.

And if it doesn't?

We die.

Tell me who you want
as if you were the leader.

Well, these two and him,
the one that brought me in.

Dan, Gad and Setur.

This is the house.

This is the temporary arena
they're building,

games for his rich friends.

All of the exits, all of
the guards are facing outward

to repel an attack
from the outside.

But we, as gladiators,
will attack from the inside.

So what do you do here?

I wash, clean,
prepare the food for him.

And you, why are you here?

I don't know.

I wanted to see you.

Why?

I wanted to make sure
you're all right.

Here with them,
lots of things happen

that I don't understand.

I hear them talk.

I see the people who go to him.

It all seems so new.

Believe in nothing.

Those who believe in something
get hurt more.

[ Rooster crows ]

Will you be back?

I don't know.

What I have to do, I might die.

The gold and--

The gold?

Only fools die for gold.

Only fools live poor.

I'm no fool.

Barabbas, he teaches
another way.

There is no other way.

There's only survival.

It's never been different,
never will be.

You take as much
as you can while you live,

and then it's over
and nothing,

except, maybe, love.

[swords clashing ]


[ Grunting, shouting ]

The only thing
I truly care about,

the only thing is my reputation.

Ask anyone, from Gaul to Numidia
to Asia Minor, they will all say

that the name of Druso Pollione
is a guarantee.

My gladiators must be prepared
to kill and be killed.

They asked me for five,
five worthy of the challenge

for this rich Roman's party.

I don't want to know who you are
nor where you come from.

I don't care if you are killers
escaped from prison

or valorous soldiers.

But I want you to know that
this is your last chance.

20,000 sesterces
will go to the winner,

to he who is still standing
after fighting

the great gladiators from Rome.

I want to see you in action,
so I may choose the very best.

The weapons are blunted.

I want to see viciousness
and determination,

but no blood.

Not yet anyway-

[ grunting, shouting ]

[thumping I

[ shouts ]

[grunting ]

Attack.

[grunting ]

[ Groans ]

Stop.

Stop!

It's enough.

I told you, it's enough!

Take him.

Wild animals like
you can be useful,

but they must learn
to recognize their master.

I am your master.

Three days in the cell,
without food and water.

You shouldn't have done that.

He was going to kill you.

You almost ruined
all of our plans.

The plan will fail
without you.

You're wrong.

No one is indispensable.

<i>Three of us can succeed.</i>

Druso chose me and Dan.

What about Setur?

Setur is out,
along with one of the Nubians,

the two Thracians
and the Syrian.

I managed to convince Druso
that without you,

the party would not live up
to its expectations.

You won't get another chance to
learn the lesson and to think,

to think before acting.

What if my plan fails?

What then?

Then you die.

Your men need you.

Too late.

The Lord does not
abandon his children

in their hour of need.

Tell me what you feel.

Feel? Why?

By the time the sun rises,
we all might be dead.

Fear never worked for me.

I believe in force alone.

No one is alone, not if he
fights together with others.

You know what I want.

You'll get your gold.

Good.

Nothing else matters.

You're playing blind,
Barabbas,

despite having eyes to see with.


[ laughter ]

I just want you with me.

I told you I love you,
love you, love you so.

[ laughs I

[ chattering ]

Yeah!

[ Cheering, applause ]

These who are about
to die salute you!

Let the games begin!

Go. Go.

Go. Go. Go.

Good luck.

Nothing happens by chance,
Barabbas.

Go!

[ Grunting, shouting ]

Kill him!

[ Cheering ]

Kill!

[ Chanting ]

Kill. Kill.

Kill. Kill. Kill.

[ Cheering ]

<i>And now, from Rome,
Cams Tufius.</i>

[ cheering ]

And from Jerusalem, Barabbas.

[ Booing, laughing ]

Let's see
if you've learned anything.

[grunting ]

[ Cheering ]

[ laughs I

[grunting ]

Don't.

Don't do it.

[ Booing I

No.

He killed him.

I did not signal.

He killed him.

He's an animal, my lord.

Uncontrollable.

He will fight again.

Now, put your last winner
against him.

Now.

Yes, my lord.

I will.

You will die for this.

Tonight, you will die.

Kedar.

Kedar.

Kill him.

[screaming ]

[grunting ]

[screams ]

[ Door opens ]

Wait.

He's gone.

[grunting ]

Stay down.

[grunting ]


[horse neighing]

[dog barking]

[ Neighing ]


[ Groans ]

The Romans don't even come up
here to collect the taxes.

And if they did, only the Lord
is privy to man's actions.

[grunting ]

Careful.

[ Groans ]

This is where
our paths separate.

I don't know when
I'll see you again.

You're a better man
than you think, Barabbas.

You do have a destiny.

You must allow yourself
to see it.

Go.

[ Panting ]

Barabbas: Dan, do you believe
in destiny?

Dan: I believe in God,
and I believe that He knows

what He wants from each of us.

If that is destiny,
then, yes, I believe.

[screaming ]

[grunting ]

In here?

There is nothing.

We are poor people.

We have nothing to hide.

Commander, I beg you.

We keep the teachings
of God in there.

[ Shouts ]

[ Sobs ]

[coughing ]

Blood begets blood.

I believe you have
something I want.

[crowd shouting]

You're an adulteress,
admit it.

Go on, admit it now!

Yes, but please,
have pity on me.

I have a small son.


I have a son.

No, please. Please.

This woman was caught
committing adultery.

The law of Moses commands
us to stone her.

You say you wish
to uphold law to the letter.

Tell us, what must we do?

Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

Stop.

Wait.

Pilate, you shouldn't
be seen with someone like me.

With you, I feel comfortable.

You don't judge me.

I don't mean to be rude,
but you don't seem happy.

You're the wife of the governor,
you have everything.

He was different
when I married him.

He had dreams.

He encouraged me to dream.

Now, he lives off
hate and fear.

He's tormented by Rome,
by Judea,

by all his responsibilities.

He protects you.

It means he worries about you.

I'm just one
of his many worries.

You shouldn't say that.

I'm sure he loves you.

I failed him.

I didn't give him what he wanted
most, what I wanted,

a child.

It was Jesus who gave me
a reason to hope again.

Thank you.

He frightens me.

Why?

The love he talks of.

It's not the love you
feel for another person.

It's a love that
I'm afraid to understand.

It's too big.

You're in love,
aren't you, Esther?

The man you saved.

I don't know where he is,
but I did see him again.

[ laughs I

Tell me.

[swords clashing, grunting ]

This is what
I took from you at Cana.

You cannot erase the past.

What happened happened.

How would you restore
the lives you took?

Save it for them.

That's my share.

I need nothing.

When you see Kedar,
you tell him--

Kedar has been captured.

The Romans have him.

The Romans have
captured Kedar.

We need to go.

All right. Mount up.

Come on, get up
to you horses. Move.

I call to you, oh, Lord.

Listen to me,
listen to my cry for help.

I raise my hands to You
and beg You to heed my prayer.

This is no time to pray.

He who has faith will see
the power of the messiah.

[crowd shouting]

Oh, Lord, my strength,
my rock, my fortress,

my shield, my savior.

[ Screaming, shouting ]

[grunting ]

You will lead us
in battle again.

You are our hope.

I leave you my faith
in the messiah,

he will come to lead us.

I want you to know
that with you,

I've seen what life
would've been like

if I'd had a father.


Attacked by
overwhelming enemy forces.

Better still:
attacked with the complicity

of the local population
by overwhelming enemy forces.

I would have preferred
to die with my men.

A wonderful sentiment.

Untie me.

He left me alive
so that you would know

that zealots will
continue the struggle.

And if a leader falls,
others will be ready

to take up his sword.

Who?

Barabbas.

His name is Barabbas.

Barabbas, a dead man.

A gladiator?

I was told it was him.

Was he wounded?

I don't know,
but it's the law of the arena.

But it isn't God's law.

No, it isn't God's law.

Esther...

They killed him, didn't they?

[sobbing ]

[children singing]

Thank God you're alive.

You're alive.

They saw you fight in the arena.

I was afraid I'd never
see you again.

I'm here now.

And then one day
he said to me,

"You will bear witness to me."

What does bear
witness to me mean?

I don't know.

Ask him.

I've seen how you
follow him around.

I've seen how you look at him.

You're jealous.

I don't know the meaning
of the word jealous.

What do I have to be jealous of?

You owe me nothing.

I owe you more
than you can imagine.

You do?

Good.

What does that mean?

I'm with child.

Child?

Our child.

Our child.

Esther...

this is no time for children.

I ask you nothing.

How can a man without a home,
a criminal bound

for a cross raise a child?

I will return to Jerusalem
and find somewhere to live.

You will come to me
when you can.

I don't want him
to know his father.

That is why I'm here.

The zealots need men
that are willing to fight.

I will let you
talk to the men.

Thank you.

The word of
the prophet Isaiah.

The spirit of
the Lord God is upon me.

He has chosen me to take
His message to the poor.

He sent me to proclaim
the release of the prisoners,

to restore sight to the blind,
to free the oppressed,

to announce the time in which
the laws will be favorable.

Today, for you who've heard me,
this prophecy will come true.

What are you saying,
that you are the messiah?

Blasphemy.

[ Clamoring ]

Take him away!

It's an outrage!

Throw him out.

He's a liar.

Lord, if you had been here,
my brother would still be alive.

Where did you bury him?


Lord.

You have come. You have come.

Rabbi.

Remove the stone.

Lord?

He's been in there
for four days.

His body will have
started to decompose.

Remove the stone.

[ Groaning, coughing ]

Lazarus, come out.

[gasping ]

It's Lazarus.

[ Chattering ]

He's alive.

It's a miracle.

[ Chattering ]

[gasps 1

From the dead, Pontius,
from the dead.

Raised from the dead.

What do you want me to do,
write to the emperor?

I will write to say that there
is a man here in Palestine

capable of raising the dead.

Is that what you want?

That Pilate becomes
the laughing stock of Rome?

That he's gone mad because
of his failure

to maintain law and order.

That's all that bothers you.

It must bother me.

Too often, you forget
that I am the governor

of these lands.

Sometimes I'd rather
not talk to the governor.

Sometimes I wish I could talk
to the man who took me

at 16 years of age
from my father's house

and who swore to love me.

I've never stopped
loving you.

In spite of everything,
is that what you mean?

In spite of a fact that I am
no longer the woman I was?

And now you think I've gone mad.

I wholly believe that we all
need strong motives to survive,

and you need to believe
in that man's miracles.

But what this Jesus of Nazareth
does, what he says,

true or false,
it's a fire consuming

everything in its path.

And we must stop him,
before he consumes us, too.

Do you really love me?

Yes, I do.

Then promise me
you'll do nothing to harm him.

I will do as you wish.

I've been expecting you.

They will never go out.

More will come tomorrow
and the days after.

They will light more and more
to keep the memory alive.

Memory of what?

What exactly
happened here, Esther?

Jesus called for Lazarus
to come out of the tomb,

and he came back from the dead.

Then he was not dead.

I heard Jesus ask Martha,
that's Lazarus' sister,

"Who do you think I am?"

And she answered,
"I believe you are the messiah,

you're the son of God
who has come into the world."

Keep it.

Oh, thanks.

Are you Jesus of Nazareth?

And who are you?

I'm Barabbas of Jerusalem.

So are you also
traveling to Jerusalem?

Is that where you going?

Well, don't, there's danger.

What danger?

The priests of the temple
say that, because of Lazarus,

the people believe in you
and they would

follow you anywhere.

How did you hear of this?

Our people are everywhere.

The zealots?

They say you want to be crowned
king of Israel.

And what do you think,
Barabbas?

I think if that is true,
then everyone in this land

is ready to fight for you.

To fight.

Yes, fight, led by
a messiah with a sword of fire.

Do you believe
in the messiah?

I believe in a leader
who will come

to liberate his people.

And this messiah
is a warrior?

All over this land,
there are thousands of fires

of rebellion.

The people are
just waiting for a sign.

What I say, what I do,
is there

for all to hear and see.

Well, say the word and you
will be king of Israel.

No, my kingdom
is not of this earth.

Did you not say
that with you,

all the prophecies
would be fulfilled?

I heard you.

My kingdom is not
of this earth.

What are you saying?

It is here on earth
where we need a messiah

who will fight for our freedom.

Do you not understand that?

Did you not say that you were
the son of the almighty?

My kingdom
is not of this earth.

Charlatan.

You are not the messiah.

You do not have a kingdom.

-- Master, we have to go.
-- You have nothing.

Politician.

You are a politician.

Those who believe will
wake up sooner or later.

[ Chanting ]

[ laughing ]

Do you hear that?

They acclaim him as
the king of Israel.

It's none of my business.

He doesn't threaten
the interest of Rome.

To proclaim oneself
the son of God

is an intolerable sacrilege.

According to your laws
perhaps, not ours.

You're wrong.

I know Rome better than you.

I fear it will mean
certain rebellion

in every village in Israel.

I have enough man
to crush any rebellion.

No one will stop them
if they believe

the messiah has come.

I see no armies
ready to follow him.

Your wife was seen among
those who listen to him.

We wouldn't be masters of
the world if we didn't take

an interest in everything.

We will all pay
for your mistake.

Meaning?

This evil must be stopped.

You go talk to Herod.

Sort it out amongst yourselves.

My lord,
I have information for you.

Who are you?

What do you want?

There's going to be
an insurrection.

An insurrection against Rome?

Yes, during Passover.

Are you sure?

Yes, I've overheard
Barabbas speak of it.

Barabbas.

It's madness to believe
anything that criminal says.

Which is why I'm here,
my lord.

Barabbas believes in nothing.

He will lead everyone
to their death.

Do you know
where I can find him?

Here in the city, my lord.

Right now, in front
of the sanhedrin,

with the crowd waiting to hear
if Jesus of Nazareth

will be acquitted or condemned.

And then Caiaphas approached
the Nazarene and said,

"In the name of the living God,
I entreat you

to tell us if you
are the messiah,

the Christ, the son of God."

And he answered,
"Your words, not mine."

Get him.

Get him
he's up there.

After him.

Get him.

Out of the way.

Barabbas, come.

Here, in there.

[ Door crashes open ]

No, there's no one.

[screams ]

Esther!

[ Shouting, grunting ]

Esther!

Run.

[ Groans ]

If you are the messiah,

why not bring these prison
walls down around you?

Why not?

Messiah, why not?

Why not bring these prison walls
down around you?

Messiah.

Messiah.

Why not?

Esther?

Esther?

Esther?

[gasps 1

Esther.

Esther.

My baby.

My baby.


Move.

It's is the tradition
at Passover

to set free a prisoner,
one chosen by the people.

You, the people of Jerusalem,
will decide.

Which of these
two condemned men

do you wish to see set free,
Jesus of Nazareth or Barabbas?


Jesus of Nazareth
or Barabbas?

Barabbas.

Barabbas.

Barabbas.

[crowd chanting]

Barabbas.

No. Please.

No!

My lord, please.

[ Chanting, shouting ]


Move!

Please, stop them.

I can't.

Jesus is innocent.

It doesn't depend on me.

Then who?

Who if not you?

Who's in charge here, who?

The law.

The people had to decide,
and they decided.

They're afraid, Pontius.

Don't you understand?

They still have no idea
who he is.

If they had believed in him,
they would have saved him.

You shouldn't
have let it happen.

I followed the law, Claudia.

No stupid law
will ever be enough

to justify your allowing
this to happen.

Don't let her
out of your sight.

[ Shouts ]

What has any of this achieved?

What's the point of not
taking up the sword and fighting

for what you believe in?

You want to go back to jail?

Get out of here before
someone realizes

a mistake has been made.


[crowd shouting]

You'll get
what's coming to you.



Messiah?

I heard you speak.
Your a fraud!

[ laughs I

You fake.

No. No water.
