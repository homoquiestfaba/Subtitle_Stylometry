But don't lie to me.

Enrique!

You can't follow me

Sit down.

I don't go following
you around.

What's up

Put your hands

I didn't raise you to be

You didn't raise me!

You can't just come in here

Well, I am your papi, I am!

Dejalo, Kike.

You told him?

Yeah.

He plays the trade!
Shut up, Antoine!

He ain't after your ass, so
why you worried about it?

How he gonna want her

After she told

If he ain't playing
the trade?

Cause she's
a bad bitch!

(All laughing)


No, Mami, no.

I cannot be bothered this week,
I told you Saturday.

I'm not being
fresca, you know I love you.

(Phone vibrating)

Hello?

You're not stupid.

He's good.

So go ahead.

Tell me to go fuck

Tell me what

Because I don't know what

I thought you were tired
from going

With that new
boyfriend of yours.

What are

I don't got no
boyfriend.

No?
No...

Don't lie to me,
Angie.

I ain't fucking stupid.

Look, I don't expect
anybody to wait three years.

That ain't natural.

I was up north.

You had to do
what you had to do.

But I'm home now.

I don't want to see
no dudes.

I don't
want to smell it.

That's it.

If you want me,
it can only be me.

Okay.

You know
I missed you, Enrique.

You sure?

Of course, stupid.

Hold me.

(Heavy breathing and moaning)

*

Uh-oh, back that shit up.
Enrique mento!

Hey, Mike!

Want to bat?

Come on, Mike!

Yeah... Yeah!

Remember how we used
to do it?

Hey, he's gonna mess up
the whole flow of the game.

Dejalo, dejalo...
Come on.

That's gonna throw
everything off.

Danny, just
throw the ball, dude.

Man, he's gonna take
my spot.
All right.

Remember how we used to do it
in little league, right?

Choke up on the bat,
put your shoulder into it.

Come on, throw him a nice juicy
one so he can smack it!

Yo, what if he hits
a home run?

Yo, just shut up

Okay.

Ponsela, ponsela!

Come on, Michael!

Esta seria, aqui.

Go, go!

Go, run it out!

Run Michael, run it out,

Run!

It's okay, that's okay.

You want to take another

No, it's okay.

(Cell phone ringing)

Ma, I'm gonna run,

Okay, mi Amor.

Where's he going?

I don't know...
with his friends?

You can keep it up.

One, two, three, four,
five, six.

Why you let him play with that
shit for?

Let him be, Enriquito.

He's a little man, why don't you
put a ball in his hand?

Get him out there with
the other kids?

Do me a favor, E.,

Don't worry
about raising my kids.

They have me for that.

Worry about your
own kid.

What's that supposed
to mean, huh?

I'm just saying, be a father to
your own kid, that's all.

Cayense,
cayense la Boca.

Be nice.
Igualito a papi, no?

Callate la Boca!
What you talking about
papi for?

That nigga was never there.

Yeah, E., and how are

What the fuck, Karina?

I told you not to curse
in front of the fucking kids,

You fucking fuck.

*

You said your mother
was upstairs?

Yeah, but she don't
bother me though.

Why don't you sit down?

Make yourself comfortable,

You did that?

Yeah.

Why you ain't talking?

I'm talking.

Why don't you come

So you can

Stop it...
Enrique, no!

Leave it alone, he's not
hurting anybody!

Papi, no, stop,
I'm sorry!

You don't disrespect
this house.

Sit the fuck down,

Don't do this,
he's not hurting anybody.

Put your fucking hands down.

You're a fucking man, Michael,
You're not a woman!

No, no!
Get your fucking hands...

Why you doing this?

Why are you defending
this shit, huh?

Don't you understand...

You're supposed

Kike... Kike!

Stop it...
just stand still.

Papi!
Stop it!

Papi, please stop!

Shh.

Stop, stop.

Anything else?

Um...

You got the coins?

Yo, damn,

They got a club in there.

Yo, they got these like plush

It's like a hangout.

You should see the way this

Waving his arms and shit.

That's wild, B, but come on

Um, they did the thing,

Of course not.

I just thought you were

So Michael is one of my
favorite students.

Rodriguez.

Sorry?

Michael Rodriguez is
our son.

No, yeah,
I meant Michael Rodriguez.

He's got a knack
for poetry.

He writes
beautifully, you know.

It must be difficult
for you, though.

How so?

Well, I mean with the issues
Michael's having.

You know, the...

His refusal to
use the boy's bathroom,

The eyeliner in class,
et cetera.

You know, all
the things you and I spoke of

A month ago Mrs. Rodriguez...

You made me look like
a fool in there.

It isn't like that,
Kike.

Listen.
No, I have been listening.

You been keeping a lot of
shit from me.

I'm supposed to
find out from his teacher?

How the hell you think that
makes me look, huh?

He's walking
around out here,

Going to the fucking
girl's bathroom?

What the fuck's
that say about me?

I'm sorry, I thought this
was about Michael.

Don't fucking start,
Angie!

You don't need
that shit anyway.

Like, not at all.

Wait, check you out.

Girl, you ain't all
churchgoing goody two shoes.

Look at that frumpy
old church.

It moved, God moved.

Shut up, puta.

Kike, please!

What the fuck.

What the fuck

What the...

Oh...

Enrique.
That's my son.

No...

Kike, listen.

You didn't notice your
shit was missing?

Don't blame me for
this, E.!

What the fuck were you doing
this whole time?

I was working, pendejo!

Where were you, huh?

Tough guy?

No.
Where were you?

Angie, you don't
get it.

The shit that...

Goes down
behind those walls.

You can't understand.

And here, my son wants
to be like this.

(Music playing from club)

All right!

So we ready to keep
it going?

Let's welcome up to the...

She needs no introduction.

Vanessa from the Boogie Down!

(Cheers and applause)

Show 'em how it's done.

I'm trying something a little
bit different.

I am standing right here.

Tucked in the mess of
my own fear.

Far from fine.

In your eyes I seem to fall
farther and faster

Than you have
time to catch me.

From a boy balanced on
his shoulders

Who can take on the stars.

Where were you from bedtime
to dawn?

Tucking me in,
instead of ducking out.

Where are your arms when
I just need them

To wrap around and hold me?

I am standing right here,
just as you left me.

I am begging
right here for you to see me.

I will try and I will try.

I'll try to be whoever
you need me.

See me.

(Cheering and applauding)

Right there in front of your
fucking boy,

I don't give a shit.

Papa!

Vente.

Ven aca.

Vamanos.

Where we going?

We're going
for a little ride.

Entra.

You can sit down.

Not me, Michael.

Have a seat.

Este es Tu hijo?

Si, ese es...
hagale un hombre.

Mira.

No Te preocupes.

Ã‰l no habla espaÃ±ol
muy bien.

Â¿Ah, no habla espaÃ±ol?

That's a pity...

(Door opening and closing)

You have
pretty eyes.

Anyone tell you
that?

Shh, shh.

It's okay.

I'm not gonna
hurt you.

Give me that.

Aqui.

Ay.

Ay, that's it, papi,
Mira, asi.

It's okay, papito.

Shh, shh, shh.

Sweet, sweet boy.

Shh...

Shh, shh.


Tate tranquilito,

Where is he?

Kike.

Did you hurt
my baby?

No, I...

You son of
a bitch.

What did you do, where
is he?

Where is he?
I don't know!

You're going to
find him.

As God is my witness,
you are going to find him.

Yes... yes, you!

I'll call the police,
I swear to God.

I swear to God I will throw
you back in that cage

If you don't
bring my baby home.

Baby, how the fuck
am I supposed to know

Where he is?
I don't give a fuck!

I don't give a fuck.

I don't give a fuck,
you will figure it out.

Go, go, go!
Okay, okay.

Fuck, I'm ready to go inside
and get in shape.

I think my baby girl is in
for a treat tonight.

Yo, that's the shorty that
wanted me to wifey it up,

But she let the next nigga
hit it.

I was like, "How you want me to
wifey it up"

And you let dude hit?"

Shit, that's why you can't trust
these bitches, man.

Can't trust
niggas, neither, man.

Yo, she even got the name
"Danny" tattooed on her pussy,

But I don't know if it
was for me,

'Cause that
nigga's named Danny, too.


Nah, that shit ain't
funny, Tico.

A'ight!

Yo, I don't think
Michael's around here.

Yo, just
keep driving man.

Yo, stop the car.

Yo, Pete, let me get
that ratchet...

You all right, B.?

(Club music playing)

Yo, come with me.

You all right?

Where y'all going?

What you want, man?

Yo, just get back
down there.

Yo, what the fuck man?

Just shut the...
Shut the fuck up.

Right there, turn around.

Look at me.

*

Open your legs.

Open your fucking legs!

I got
a wife and kids, man.

Yeah, you got wifey?

Yeah?

Open your fucking legs!

You like to touch wifey?

Huh, huh?

Motherfucker!

E., E.!

Come on, lets go.

Come on, man.

E.!

Huh?

You good, B.?
Yeah.

Come on, man, let's go.

Come on.

Come on, we gotta go,
we gotta go.

(Club music thumping)

(Cell phone vibrating)

Hello?

Okay.

Okay, thank you.

He's at Hector's.

It's not me he's running
away from.

17 years, Kike.

I gave
my life to you.

It was hard, but
I did it.

I put my trust
in you because I knew

You would take care
of us.

But now my baby's
out there.

E., I don't know
what happened to you up there,

But it has nothing to do
with Michael.

The boy loves you.

He needs you.

We need you.

(Door creaking open)

Hold it, hold it.

Right there, right
there.

I just want my family.

Can I talk to him?

Son.

Um...

I know I've made a lot
of mistakes.

I still don't know
what I'm doing, you know.

I never meant to
hurt you.

My son.

My boy.

My baby boy.

My flesh and blood, pa.

But you ain't no baby
no more.

You can make
your own decisions.

We want just want you
back home, son.

Just come back home.

All right?

(Whispering prayer)

*

Get the fuck off!

Get the...

Wait up, wait up!

Michael... Michael!

Michael... Micheal!

Micheal!
