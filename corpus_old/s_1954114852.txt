<i># When I wake up in the morning, love</i>

<i># And the sunlight hurts my eyes</i>

<i># And something without warning, love</i>

<i># Bears heavy on my mind</i>

<i># Then I look at you</i>

<i># And the world's alright with me</i>

<i># Just one look at you</i>

<i># And I know it's gonna be</i>

<i># A lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely...</i>
