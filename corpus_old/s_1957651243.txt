(rock music)


(match rasping)

(suspenseful music)


[Woman] They ordered hookers.

It's too dangerous,
even with you inside.

We can do this
with help, Andrew.

Yeah, we'd score
enough to leave town.

[Woman] Leave and
start new lives.

â™ª Something this way comes

â™ª Riding on the air
like a distant drum â™ª

â™ª What it is I cannot say

â™ª But something comes,
something comes this way â™ª

Let me ask Crazy
Six about this.

Anything could go wrong, Viyana.

I need the chance.
I know, baby, I know.


â™ª Woo hoo hoo yeah yeah

â™ª I can feel it but
I can't see it â™ª

â™ª Hear it moving, but
I can't touch it â™ª

â™ª Though I fear
it, I embrace it â™ª

â™ª Wanna run, yet I
need to face it â™ª

â™ª It's blowin'
through the windows â™ª

â™ª I hear it knocking
lightly at my door â™ª


(thunder rumbling)

Where's Mao?

10 more minutes,
we go without him.

I got six guys
with the paperwork,

three with the product, right?

Right?

Right, listen.

When they open up, I want you
to check 'em out real good.

Make it look like
you don't trust 'em.

They ordered you from a
service, so be suspicious.

[Viyana] I don't trust them.

I heard one of the girls
say they're enemies.

Put Darby in a hospital.

[Andrew] You just have
to be careful, okay?

All right, Andrew, you're
gonna go through the front door.

I'm gonna come
through the window.

I don't want any shootin', okay,
unless they start the show.

There's a couple at the the
tower, plus the plutonium.

Can stay high for the
rest of our lives.

Hallelujah.

(car horn honks)

Let's do it.

(suspenseful music)

[Man] Raul, it looks good.

[Man] Plutonium.

â™ª Is it love

â™ª Disguised as hatred

â™ª Even evil is
sometimes sacred â™ª

â™ª Are you sainted 
(thunder rumbling)

â™ª Or a sinner

â™ª You can lose

â™ª And be the winner

â™ª It's blowin'
through the windows â™ª

â™ª I hear it knockin'
lightly at my door â™ª

(blade swishes)

â™ª Ah (sings faintly)


(dog whimpers)


You're late.

(speaking in foreign
language) My little dog is sick.

Doctor says I must shoot him
twice a day with insulin.

He has diabetes.

(speaking in foreign
language), huh?

I think if time
was of the essence

you could have given us the
address a little sooner.

If I had given you
that address any earlier,

you would've ripped me off.

(ominous music)
(dog whimpers)

(speaking in foreign language)

you what, junkie boy.

Clean yourself up, maybe I give
you some gainful employment.

Raul is such an
entrepreneur, no?

(guns click)

(gunshot booming)
Whoa.

(speaking in foreign language)

(engine rumbling)


Jesus Christ, Six.

â™ª Something this way comes

â™ª Something comes this way

It's all right.
Knock knock.

Hold on.

(speaking faintly)

(knocking at door)
(guns click)

(door bangs)

[Man] Where is the others?

On their way.

(clock ticking)

(gun clicks)

(exhales sharply) I need air.

(tense music)

(dramatic music)

(blows thudding)

[Masked Man]
Nobody fuckin' move.

(speaking in foreign language)

Sit down.

Fuckin' punks.

[Man With Gun]
Now you're fucked.

[Man On Left] No killin'.

(gun clicks)
Back off.

You fuckin' rock-head.


(ominous music)

(dog whimpers)

(wordless vocalizing)
(ominous music)

(cello music)

(orchestral music)

Okay, okay.

All right, you go divide
up the money with Ari.

We'll meet back at the
club like we talked about.

What the fuck are you doin'?

You got made,
they will track you.

Hey, this ain't your
deal, you let her go.

Shae!

(speaking in foreign language)

Fuck.

(car door latch clicks)

(speaking in foreign language)

Anything comes back to
me, I come back to you.

(speaking in foreign language)
make sure her math is good.

(speaking in foreign language)

If I'm short, I'll
meet up with you later.

Don't go home tonight; I
want you out of town tonight.

All right, get outta here.

Watch yourself.

(suspenseful music)

â™ª Are you sainted or a sinner

â™ª You can lose and
be the winner â™ª

(speaking in foreign language)

[Mao] Don't be
shy, get in the car.

â™ª I hear it knockin'
lightly at my door â™ª

â™ª Something this way comes

â™ª Blowin' on the air
like a distant drum â™ª

â™ª What it is I cannot say

â™ª But something comes,
something comes this way â™ª

(suspenseful music)

(ominous music)

â™ª When I start dreaming

â™ª You take me in your arms

â™ª And never 
(dog whimpers)

â™ª Someone else's start,
I must forget you â™ª

â™ª It's a very hard
thing for me to do â™ª

â™ª In my obsessions

â™ª I write emails, I lie

Something special tonight?

â™ª I know you think by now
I should know better â™ª

â™ª It's a very hard
thing for me to do â™ª

â™ª It's slow goin'
get me over you â™ª

â™ª You've given me more

â™ª I swear to God

(Singing faintly)


â™ª In's slow goin',
gettin' me over you â™ª

â™ª It's slow goin',
gettin' me over you â™ª

(ominous music)

(soft music)

â™ª Here you are

â™ª I swear to God

â™ª Stay

â™ª And I can do

â™ª It's slow goin'
gettin' me over you â™ª

You got 48 hours.

(cell phone ringing)

Look, we paid good money
to prevent this kind of shit!

He's takin' care of it.

Okay.

(phone beeps)

â™ª I start dreaming

â™ª And you take me in
your arms, I remember â™ª

â™ª You're in someone else's
stars, I must forget you â™ª

â™ª It's a very hard
thing for me to do â™ª

â™ª It's slow goin',
gettin' me over you â™ª

â™ª It's slow goin',
gettin' me over you â™ª

â™ª I dismiss you

â™ª And conjure up your
face so I can kiss you â™ª

(audience applauding)

(glasses clinking)

Anna, (speaking
in foreign language)

You know my friend
here, Mr. Crazy Six?

Crazy Six?

Sixth one born in my family.

And you're crazy?

Little bit.

Little bit.

I think you two
have a lot in common.

Not me, I quit.

(speaking in foreign
language) Really?

My friend, I'm sorry, I think

she's way out of
your league now.

But don't say I
didn't try for you.

Excuse me, I have to get back.

You're excused.

Thanks.

See you around, Crazy.

Call me Billy.

Billy.

Don't despair, my friend.

You can have those nice
long legs wrapped around you

all night long
for an eight-ball.

It's worth it, right, Bijou?


Yes.

(techno music)

(speaking in foreign language)

I'll be back.

â™ª For the best defense

â™ª I can feel your
hunger burning to move â™ª

â™ª Blood may spill
inside this game â™ª

â™ª But no one seems
to mind the pain â™ª

â™ª I'm too caught up
in falling into you â™ª

â™ª Lights out, eye to eye

â™ª Spill or scare,
hard to learn â™ª

â™ª It's contact

â™ª To look at me

â™ª And I can feel the love
and start up contact â™ª

â™ª You and me

â™ª We'll be free, a world
that's all aflame â™ª

(ominous music)

(guns click)

â™ª Starts the passion and
pride just multiplies â™ª

â™ª Love, love is light

â™ª Shine on me

â™ª Protect me from the night

Where's Mao order?

(ominous music)
â™ª Protect

â™ª Eye to eye, skin on skin

â™ª Heart to heart, it's contact

â™ª Look at me

â™ª I can feel the love inside

(ominous music)
(gun clicks)

(rock guitar music)

(ominous music)

You have somethin'
that belongs to me.

Fuck it.


(guns click)

Everything will come back.


Billy!

(gunshots booming)

(shell casings rattle)

[Billy] You've been hit.

The cops and ambulances
will be here for me.

Go.

(suspenseful music)
(wordless vocalizing)

(ominous music)

(insects chirring)

(singing faintly)

â™ª You're dreaming of

â™ª Everything

â™ª Is so lonely

â™ª With a heart

â™ª Full of love for you

â™ª Maybe once

â™ª He'll do it so

â™ª Maybe once 
[Man] You know what I want.

â™ª Knows it seems

I want you should
tell me where Six is.

â™ª A child

You will tell me.

â™ª Your heart

(singing faintly)

(speaking faintly)

[Woman] You wanna go say hi?

Do you want to say hi?

(Viyana weeping)

No.
You will tell me.

(slap resounds)

(woman moans)
Now fuckin' tell me!

(ominous music)
(speaking faintly)

[Man] You got made,
they were tracking you.

(speaking faintly) Six.

[Woman] Don't track me.

(ominous music)

No please.

Please. (gasps)

Please no. (gasps)

(ominous music)

[Man] I hope he's worth it.

â™ª Love

[Anna] Crazy Six.

And you're crazy?

â™ª In your heart, whoa

[Crazy Six] A lot
of shootin' okay,

once they start shootin'.

â™ª In your heart, the only

(singing faintly)

â™ª She knows that love is easy


Watch yourself.

â™ª Find me love

(door latch clicks)
(telephone ringing)

(gloves snap)

[Doctor] Dakota?

Yo.

[Doctor] It's just a flesh
wound; she's gonna be okay.

I heard it was plutonium.

So I guess you wanna
question her right away.

Whenever I can.

She'll be up in a half hour.

Well, I'm takin' lunch.

You gonna join me?

No thanks, I'm on a diet.

You see, I'm startin' to look
about nine months' pregnant.

How's your old man?

[Doctor] Good.

Doin' what you should be
doin', takin' it easy.

(Dakota chuckles)

How come you never go
back to the States?

I don't know.

I think this town's
perfect for me.

I never been in a town with so
few brains and so many guns.

[Doctor] All right, see
you around, Detective.

[Dakota] That you
will, go cut somebody up.

[Doctor] I will.

I know.

(rhythmic music)

(rock music)

(stylized exhaling)

Lookin' for this?

Hey.

Huh?
Hey.

I need that.

You killed a man.

Gimme that, it's mine.
Fuckin' turn around, man.

Gimme that, lemme
see that fuckin'--

Don't you listen to me,
they fuckin' cut her up, okay?

Okay.
Okay.

[Billy] Okay, okay,
all right, okay.

I can give you half of
this money that I get--

Fucking junkie!

You're pathetic, man, you
let your friends down.

I'm sellin' this shit
to pay for the funeral.

(traffic rumbling)

Would you excuse
us for a minute?

Yes.

Hello, Miss Anna.

Hello, Mr. Texas.

How many times do
I have to tell ya,

just because you have a cowboy
hat, you're not from Texas?

I know, you're
the American pig.

Huh.

Last time I saw you,
you busted my brother.

Damn right I did, some
people are born to be busted.

Have you been behaving?

This time trouble found me.

Well, nobody's gonna
grow old in this town.

Looks like you will.


Have you been clean?

Five months.

Five months?

Wow.

What is that silver
shit on your eyes?

They're glitters.

So I'm pretty when I'm singing.

Oh, well I'll have to
come and hear you sing.

You wouldn't like it,
you like Perry Como.

I do like Perry Como.

I've decided the world is
divided into two parts:

those that like Neil Diamond,
and those that don't; I don't.

I love Neil Diamond.

You would; I
have some questions

I have to ask you again.

I don't know anything.

I think you do.

When you were
singing in your act,

you yelled out a
warning to somebody.

I don't know where you
get your information.

Who is Billy?

Billy.

Maybe I was singing
Ode to Billy Joe?

I don't think so.

It was a lousy song
when it came out

and it's still a lousy
song, you wouldn't sing it.

Dakota.

I've always liked you.

I know.
For an American pig.

But giving people up,
that's just not my style.

You know that.

Besides, it could be
bad for my health.

You get to go home
when this is over.

I don't have a home to go to.

Things are gettin' out of
hand, even for this place.

Things have been out
of hand my whole life.

Look, I know they
can't keep me here.

So do me a favor and tell the
nurse to get my paperwork.

I'm just gonna split.

Okay.


Oh, uh, congratulations.

On what?

Being clean all that time.

That's something, isn't it?

Damn right it is.

(stylized exhaling)

(ominous music)

(faintly singing)

[Man] Your thoughts are us.

(dog whimpers)

(dog yelps)

Wake up, Coo-yo!

You almost killed my
fuckin' dog, you understand?

I don't have a lot
of fuckin' friends.

This dog is my friend!

I got a lot of friends, Michel?

You don't.

Have you got a lot of friends?

I don't have a lot of friends.

You tryin' to kil
my one loyal friend?

She's sick, now you
want to kill her?

Apologize.

I'm sorry.

Not to me, you
imbecile, to her

(speaks foreign language) Bijou.

I'm sorry, Bijou.

(dog whimpers)

(singing faintly)

What do you got, Sauerkraut?

I'm Austrian, we don't eat
sauerkraut, we eat strudel.

Whatever, what do you got?

Female, 23 years old,
naturalistic style.

She's all cut up.

I got a snitch that
works downtown.

He told me a guy named Crazy Six

has done an arms
dealer yesterday.

Crazy Six and the
stiff are partners.

Crazy Six.

He's like a smallpox carrier.

Anybody gets near,
they get the fear,

he's deader than Kelsey's nuts.

Who's Kelsey Nuts?

I don't know, I never
knew what that meant.

Oh. (sighs)

Word is, Raul doesn't
recover his product

in 48 hours, he's history.

Now I'd like to put
Crazy Six on a leash,

and let Raul try to
recover his drugs and cash.

You might finally catch
the bastard dirty.

You've been with
my partner too long,

you're gettin' smart.

You got this Billy staked out?

Mm-hmm, we're running
him through right now.

Should get an address soon.

(ominous music)

(door bangs)

(gun clicks)

[Anna] Billy?

Billy, are you there?

(jazz music)

Billy, it's me
Anna, from the club.

(door bangs)

It's just me.

What are you doin' here?

[Anna] Jerzy told
me how to find you.

[Billy] Sorry 'bout that.

You wanna sit down or somethin'?

[Anna] All right.

(pop music)

How's your leg?

It's good, I don't
need to feel it.

Why were they after you?

(water drips)

I robbed me some spangers.

I needed some shooters,
so I called Dirty Mao.

A big score, real big.

But it's all turned
to shit, see.

Mao set me up; now
people are dead.

Viyana, they killed
her, that's for sure.

It's going to be a war?

A little bit.

â™ª Hey, hey

â™ª Ooh

You still don't
remember me, do you?

â™ª One two three

You used to do deals
with my brother, Joss?

You're Joss's sister.

Sorry.

You shouldn't forget
things like that.

â™ª Ooh ooh

I heard you say you quit.

I did.

Yeah, well I won't.

I can't and I won't.

Then I'll start again.

(rock music)

[Dakota] They're
in there somewhere.

[Andrew] Wasn't that, I
think we oughta go, Dakota.

Oh, shit, damn.

(rock music)

â™ª Something else this must be

(gun clicks)

[Dakota] Get your gun out!

(gunshots booming)

Come on, come on.
(gunshots booming)

(rock music)

(soft music)
(birds twittering)

Don't die on me, bro.

I'm Austrian. (coughing)

Man, it hurts.

(footsteps echoing)

(suspenseful music)

(gunshot booming)

You put that gun down now!


Where you goin', putz?

You're all boxed in,
you got nowhere to go.

[Anna] I'm going
with you, Billy.

Oh, good choice, Anna.

(speaking in foreign language)

(somber music)

[Man] Six got away,
cop's badly hit.

(raven cawing)

[Anna] Where are we going?

[Billy] This here's
the last friend I've got.


He's got company, so
you stick with me.

(blow thudding)

â™ª Are you sainted or a sinner

(gunshots booming)

(body thuds)

â™ª You can lose and be a winner


[Billy] You okay?

I'm in a bad way.

They're fuckin' comin'
out of the woodwork, Six.

You gotta get yourself hid.

Yeah.

(soft music)

(door latch clicks)

(somber music)

Dakota?

I'm sorry.

(pop music)

[Billy] You know,
after I got busted

that last time in Jacksonville,

I hopped on a freighter.

Thought I'd clear my head,
maybe get off the pipe.

We weren't out two days,
I was climbin' the walls.

I wanted to kill that captain.

Then we docked in Marseille.

I wasn't there but three hours
and I was back on the pipe.

That was five years ago.

(singing faintly)

[Anna] Maybe you
shouldn't go back.

(singing faintly)

[Billy] Maybe.

â™ª You already wanna be

[Anna] I would
like to go to Miami.

â™ª Ooh ooh ooh

You know what JC called me?

A coke whore.

Kool-Aid flavor of the month,
a blue-eyed strong man.

kicking her ass.

Yeah, well she's Goofy Grape.

Loudmouth Lime.

I guess when I was
smoking I was Fuzzy Lemon.


I don't think there
was a Fuzzy Lemon.

And I don't think that
drink was Kool-Aid.

No, I think it was
American Kool-Aid.

Like a special
promotional thing, yeah.

You might be right.

â™ª Ah

(singing faintly)

Hey, Choo-Choo Cherry.

You're okay.

(singing faintly)

You know I can't be
with you in that way.

I know.

â™ª Ah

I don't care.

â™ª That I belong to you

â™ª Nobody else is as
good to me as you â™ª

â™ª You are mine

â™ª You are mine 
Let's go score.

Yeah.

(ominous rock music)

(speaking faintly)


â™ª You let me go

â™ª You I tried to love

â™ª You let me go

(somber jazz music)

(speaking in foreign language).

Jesse, come here my dear.

I'm gonna need a
nice pot of beef.

And some cranberry juice, and a

(speaking in foreign
language) right, Bijou?

And lean this time,
no fucking fat on in,

don't give my cholesterol, okay?

(speaking in foreign language)

[Woman] Here.

Doggy.

Jesse.
Oui.

Where's that little
seductive songstress tonight?

They took her away last night.

You think she's got someone
special somewhere, huh?

Huh?

(singing faintly)

â™ª Tonight the devil's angel

â™ª And a drunk and
dreary wild spirit â™ª

(singing faintly)

â™ª Just, just turned back

â™ª Burning load on myself

Come on.

(singing faintly)

â™ª The only one I-- 

[Billy] What's wrong with you?

â™ª Ooh

[Anna] I can't
get started again.

â™ª You have to hold me too

Get outta here.

â™ª Don't let anyone else
be as good to me as you â™ª

(inhaling heavily)

â™ª You have someone

â™ª You are the one

(overlapping whispering voices)


â™ª You are the one

â™ª You are the one

â™ª Anything you want here too

(distorted music)

(ominous music)

(wordless vocalizing)

(soft music)

Viyana's dead.

Dirty Mao ripped us off.

Guess I don't even
know what the shit.

There's nothing left
in our lives, Six.

Dreaming of that crap, now
we don't even have that.

It's supposed to get easier
as life goes on; it doesn't.

It's more complicated.

It's harder.

(speaking in foreign language)

So fucking lost.

[Anna] Nyet!

(dog barking)
(speaks foreign language)

Universe sucks down, Six.

Lost everything.
Billy?

Billy.

Funny face.

Funny Face, that's
the name of the drink.

Loudmouth Lime, you
know, Goofy Grape?

Funny Face.

[Billy] When did
you think of that?

I just thought of it now.

Billy.

Those bandits came after me.

Where?
Downtown.

You're okay?

I don't know.

My little girl and I decided--

Girl?

Oh, I have a five-year-old.

She stays with my mother.

But I'm gonna take
her down to Vienna,

where I think I could save her.

I think I can get
my singing going.

I want you to come with us.

There's no good.

I got no business bein'
around that kind of thing.

After your fever breaks,
we're going to come get you.

Are you sure you
want me around?

Yeah.

I wanna stop smokin' rock.

Real bad.

(singing faintly)

Good.

We're going to
come back for you.

â™ª Oh

(singing faintly)

â™ª You slow

â™ª Love

â™ª Then it goes

All right.
What the fuck?

What are you doin'?

[Billy] What the hell
are you doin' here?

I need a place to hide.

Jesus Christ.

Raul's got Anna.

Bunch of shit.

I'm gonna meet him
tonight at the club.

[Andrew] Man, you don't
want a part of that.

Fucking look at you.

[Billy] That's all right.

He won't be expectin'
any trouble from me.


Bad odds.

Do you want my help?

[Man] At Dirty
Mao's warehouse.

(blow thudding)

(rock music)

(smooches) Is this
because of you, huh?

Fa?
(dog growls)

(blows thudding)

Don't worry,
I've sorted it out.

It's all under control.

I'll have to call you back.

You wanna fucking die here?

Where's the fucking stuff?

You got nine left, where is it?


Fuck you! (spits)


[Andrew] Where the
fuck is it, where is it?


Fucking kill!
Where the fuck is it?

Do you wanna die here?

Do you wanna fuckin' die here?

Tell me where it is.

(zipper rasps)

(footsteps echoing)

(guns click)

Yeah, go for it.

I want you to.

But before you do, can I
tell you a couple things?

(wind roaring faintly)

I'm over 50.

I ate a sandwich older
than you yesterday.

I hurt all the time.

I got 42 broken bones,
I've been shot twice,

I don't have a spleen.

But you wanna know
what hurts the most?

They took away my son.

They took away my son.

So you see, I don't give a shit.

You wanna go for it?

Let's go for it.

Raul's got my girl, he
wants to make a trade.

Raul?

I wouldn't trust Raul if
his balls were on fire

and I had a bucket of water.

(wind roaring faintly)

But I'll take him with you.

(rock music)

[Andrew] Dirty
Mao ripped us off.

[Dakota] It's no good.

[Anna] I need a chance.

[Billy] To success.

[Man] I sent you.

[Billy] Look at you.

(speaking in foreign language)

[Anna] Billy.

I just cause pain.

(ominous music)
(wordless vocalizing)

[Billy] I wanna stop.

(singing in foreign language)

(guns click)

Where's my stuff?

It's in the car.

(door latch clicks)
(car door bangs)

(ominous music)

(keys jingling)

Anna?

Yeah, looks a
little fucked up.

She's been havin'
a good time, man.

She's feeling really
good right now.

Let her go.

Go on, wanna go to
your little boyfriend?

Come on, go on, it's okay.

Or do you want another hit?

(ominous music)

Yeah man, we all
got a death wish.

(gunshots booming)

(ominous music)

Let's do it.

Come on, I'm ready, I like
my odds, let's get down.

(gunshot booming)

(guns click)

29 to two.

I like these odds better.

If I'ma die, it's
the cops we're bustin'.

Let's cut the bullshit.

Let's get on with
it, cowboy style.

I like your style, Detective,
I really like his style.

(gunshots booming)
(dramatic music)

(speaking in foreign language)

(light rock music)

(eerie music)

Billy.

Thank you for taking
care of the competition.

(breathing heavily and groaning)

(gun clicks)

Now it's just like the
movies, Mexican standoff.

(breathing heavily)

Except no one ever shoots.

(gunshot booming)

(eerie music)

(Billy gasps)

You might need this.

Since you decided to kill
Raul and rip everybody off,

I think maybe some people
come look for you, huh?

Yo, you saw to that.

With that money,
you can start over.

Clean yourself up, maybe
I give you a real job.

Sorry, Mac.

(gunshot booming)

(dog yelps)
(blows thudding)

(blows thudding)

(dog whimpering)

(slow music)

(dog growling)

What are you cryin' about?

I didn't shoot the dog.

(dog growling)

(soft rock music)

We gotta get outta here.

We've got a long
drive ahead of us.

I can't go with you.

Listen--
No, don't.

I--

I'm gonna lose.

We could have
some life together.

I got a plan for us.

[Anna] I'm tired.

Get over there, it's clean.

(dog growls)

What's the dog's name?

It's my new partner, Killer.

I can't go back to this.

I wanna see my little girl.

I can get clean.

â™ª Oh, such a long black night

â™ª Surrounded by the
absence of light â™ª

(smooches) I'll
come see you, kid,

when you get a live band.

I still won't sing Perry Como.

I'll come see you anyway.

â™ª Pieces remain to remind

â™ª Of what could have
been in another time â™ª

I can get clean.

â™ª Another time

I can...

â™ª Maybe tomorrow

â™ª We'll live as one

â™ª Maybe tomorrow

â™ª We'll walk in the
sun, walk in the sun â™ª

â™ª We'll walk in the sun

â™ª I hear you tryin' to cry

â™ª Won't listen to-- 
Billy.

Thanks for bein' my friend.

â™ª When everything you
loved is gone for good â™ª

[Billy] Take care of yourself.

â™ª What could have
been another day â™ª

â™ª Another day

â™ª Maybe tomorrow

â™ª We'll live as one

â™ª Maybe tomorrow

â™ª We'll walk in the
sun, walk in the sun â™ª

â™ª We'll walk in the sun

â™ª Maybe tomorrow

â™ª Maybe tomorrow

â™ª Ooh

â™ª Hey

â™ª Ooh hey

[Billy] I told
you I could do it.
