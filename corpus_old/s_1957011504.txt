IN THE HEART OF THE MIRACLE

BYSTRICA
a town in Slovakia 1944

Stop shaking my
distributor or break up!

That's enough enough!

Hello sir.

I am looking for someone.

It's too late.

I beg your pardon?

He called you.

Hey, I can have my key please.

Listen, you know the rule

pay your rent if
you want your key, understand?

No, no one called me.

Of course he did, he called the church,
he called Saint Cecilia

for a priest to come and give him the ...

the last sacraments.

Extreme anointing?

I'm sure I paid my rent!

No,  you didn't pay it, then break my balls more!

Yeah, that's it. Except that no one showed up, all right?

He is dead ?

Yeah, you come fine for
old Joe Pinella, right?

Oh no.

I'm looking for Frank Shore.

He is still alive.

Where is he ?

If he's not in his room, try
the soup kitchen opposite, on the 10th.

Who wants to give me his share
pie today?

Say, you give me your slice of pie?
Come on be nice, give me your pie.

Yo man, you give me your piece of pie?
No, but you're not? Let go of me !

I want a piece of pie
who will give me his share of the pie.

Sorry.

How are you today, Frank?
Alright, thank you Beverly.

1,2,3,4,5 and 6.

Oh the pretty slice of pie. Tell me
the deal, eh, come on, I'll owe you that.

Here, my old Higgins.

Don't you have 1 or 2 steaks too?

What are you doing ?

I thank the Lord.

I will pray for you.

Thanks, that's nice.

I will pray for you.

I will pray for you.

Oh yes. I will pray for you.

Frank?

John.

Frank, this would be extreme.

Yes, but at least it's filling.

I wasn't talking about the food.

Sit down.

So ... are you writing a new book?

No. Absolutely not.

I made my students read "The God Within",
it's a good book, Frank. They loved it.

It is true ?

What do you do with your days then?

I live.

The 40 days and nights in the desert thing, I can understand,

but it's been 8 months.

How did you find me?

Frank, don't tell me that
you feel in your place here!

I don't know that, John.

You left without telling anyone.

I...

The truth is, Cahill wants to see you.

He needs you

He has need of you.

So unless you've decided
to no longer be one of us ...

I tried not to take too much
decisions lately.

You have taken a vow of obedience.
Cahill wants to see you.

You'll see, it's that simple. It's time to go.

You mustn't have opened a newspaper since
a long time otherwise you would know about it.

Was there another one?

A marble statue of the Virgin who stands
found in the courtyard of the Saint Stanislas school.

You know this neighborhood well,
you grew up there.

Yes, I went to Sainte Bonnie.
Perfect. You will have no trouble finding yourself.

Always populated by Poles,
Hispanics, a few Micks from the old days.

People who work hard despite everything.

What did she do ?

The marble statue, I mean.

That's a very good question, they're doing a lot right now, right?

They wave ... They levitate ...

Near Skokie there is a little Jesus in
plastic that drinks milk for real,

or a guy who cuts open an avocado
and sees the face of the Virgin.

This is a sign that the Millennium is approaching.
Without a doubt.

What is this one doing, Excellency?

It this one's an old fashioned girl.

She's just crying.

Tears of blood.
How did you guess ?

Do you want a drink?

Explain it to him, John.

She would already have several healings to her credit.

The documentation looks pretty solid,
especially the case of Maria Witkowski.

About 7 years ago she
was 9 years old at the time.

He was diagnosed
end-stage lupus.

Everything is written in there, there is also a video.

The statue bled on her and she healed.

Except it's not the statue
that people pray to.

But a lay woman.

The late Mrs. Helen O'Regan.

A nice widow.

She lived in the convent, prepared the meals

She opened a soup kitchen
in the neighborhood.

She even worked in
the orphanage created by the sisters.

She was loved by all,
until the day she died.

It is from this moment that
the statue began to cry.

It's her blood that the statue cries, or
at least that's what people believe

And of course, they are calling for canonization.

"Saint Mrs. Helen O'Regan",
this is what they want her to become.

And someone told them that there is
only had 3 American saints?

I said these people work hard
not that they were geniuses.

Did you call a chemist?

He could tell you if it's blood.

No, frankly we've stayed away.

But they have already collected more than 10,000
signatures on a petetion, tour buses.

Even the mayor signed.

You see, there is already a cult that
growing up around her.

As for Father Falcone at Lake Monroe.

And you were brilliant on Falcone.

I destroyed the faith of an entire community.

If for you, that's what being brilliant ...

It is, otherwise I wouldn't have pulled you out of that stinking shithouse

where John found you.
You did what hadda be done.

Is there anything else
I need to know about this statue?

Only that she is very particular.

She only cries when it rains
and only in November,

that's the month
Helen O'Regan is dead.

A teleconference, Monsignor.
MP Darcy is already online.

Margaret, don't you
not enough to be right?

Listen to me carefully.

I don't know what demons you're fighting against
but you are still my postulator.

You took a vow of obedience, I need that
you take care of that quickly, you got that?

What's the urgency?

You did not listen to me ?
We are October 28th.

Congressman?

Yes !

Yes that's right.

Yes, it is a question of money.

No no no.

What about your game?

When was the first time?

The bleeding from the statue?
7 years ago.

I celebrated a mass in memory of Helen
when that little girl came in

one of Helen's favorites who
had suffered from lupus for years.

In the name of the father, the son
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

Sit down, please.

Good morning all.
Hello father.

We could have done better on the weather, eh?

Helen would have been so happy to ...

... What am I talking about?
Helen is happy.

Helen is happy.

She is watching us from up there.

And see how many of you have got
braved the rain to celebrate her memory

She gave so much love.
I'm sure she is

in paradise with Jesus, and Mary
by his side, right now.

Go join your class, little one.

My child ?

Before this incident,
the doctors said she her lupus would be fatal.

They were adamant.

And after that ?

The blood of the statue completely healed her.

It's written in the file
that I sent to the diocese.

Oh that sounds interesting setup.

Yeah, yeah, it's new,
there is a money box here.

No need to light the candles,
just touch this and...

Helen loved this room.

She could see the children
play during recess.

And then also see the statue, which was very dear to her.

She lived in the convent?
She was a lay woman.

She loved taking care of the kids.
Mostly problem children.

So many nights she had
to work until very late and ...

how she liked to attend mass
in the morning, it was more convenient for her.

It's his daughter, Roxanne.

Her daughter ? I'll have to talk to her.

She's not a practicing Catholic,
nor a supporter of our cause.

This is your cause father, not ours.

Or at least not yet.

Father Panak. I'm here to decide if
the cause must be recommended to Rome.

And that doesn't happen very often.

Very often ?

Have you ever recommended
a case to Rome? Father Shore?

He was a soul chosen by God.

I'll have to talk to his friends,
her enemies and ...

She had no enemies.
Read her newspaper or letters that she ...

It may be difficult,
she was almost illiterate.

She could only read the Bible.

She must have started working very young.
And did not have a proper education.

You know she was the child of poor immigrants?

Yes, they came from Ireland.
From Austria.

Her maiden name was Gabor.
Did you just open the file?

I will set up my office in this room.

Father Shore.

We have been praying for years for this investigation for years.

I will do everything in my power.

Prayers for Father Falcone

You were a friend of Father Falcone,
Brother Gregory?

Yes that's right.

We talked every night.

He was a great spiritual guide.

Not only for me, but also
for all these people, excuse me.

Is that where he drowned?

We found his boat near
from the boathouse over there.

You who art in heaven. Please
to answer our chaste prayers and from us ...

Help me please.

Help me please.

Sir, can you help me?

Thank you.

Take that away from him.

Come on. Help us.

Thank you so much.

I beg you heal
my son please.

Thanks for coming, doctor.

Oh no, it's my pleasure. You know it's a case
I never tire of talking about.

Kate Malloy.

Yeah, uh we opened it up and uh, we threw it
a quick glance and we sewed it up

Do you see the tumor was lodged in a way
such that removing it was hopeless.

So, She was sent home.

And she began to pray to Father Falcone.

She had confessed
to him for years.

When you saw her again,
where was the tumor?

She was gone. There was not even
scar due to the previous operation

nothing at all, not a trace.

Now I refuse to call it a miracle,

it is not a word that I use because
what do you see, I am a Jew.

I don't believe in Catholic miracles.

I hope you do
don't blame me, father.

It makes him even more believable,
You can not find ?

I mean the doctor don't believe in our
miracles and yet he seems to think ...

These are not yet
our miracles, Brother Gregory.

Listen, I know how it goes.

I know it takes more than a miracle
and proofs of heroic virtue

to make a Saint, but ...

We don't make Saints.
God makes them.

So he made one of Father Falcone.

Thank you.

Hello. Were you at the lake?

Hello. Were you at the lake?
Yes, my father.

You couldn't walk
nor stand up.

I feel much better
today, my father.

Father Shore?

What happened to you ?

What happened ?

What happened to your son?
What happened to him ?

He could neither walk
nor stand up.

[on paper in woman's hand] In memory of Father Falcone.

Prayers to Father Falcon

What are you looking for ?
Evidence against him?

Don't worry, there's nothing here that I can find.

I can't find the notes of his sermons.
Nor the papers on which he took them.

I should never have agreed to speak to you.

I have to find out the truth
It's my job.

Oh Lord.

"In the darkness is power ...

The power of Azazel, Barakiel, Sariel.

Darkness calls, I answer them.
I give myself to them. "

Look at this.

I never knew about any of this.

I did not realize before his death ...

Not realized what?

Well, towards the end
he was depressed and he was scared but ...

"Darkness calls, I answer them."

I want to see the police report on his death.

You already have it, it's in the file.

These are just forms they filled out.

The report will say that they considered
the possibility of suicide

but that they then ruled it out.

Yes, under pressure from the parishioners.

Many policemen are parishioners.

Falcone committed suicide and you want
that I make a saint?

I believed that only God made Saints?

Do you know what you are called?

My friends in the Archdiocese told me.

They call you the miracle killer.

You knew...

you knew something was wrong
but you closed your eyes.

You let it all happen.
I did not want...

It's a goddam circus, nothing more!

I just wanted ...

I know all about "I wanted to...".

But, and the miracles, the healings!

Belief is powerful,
ask the doctors.

You were at the lake. You have seen.
You felt it too.

But it was not the work of God,
was it ?

Or maybe that
God played with us?

You sound like him, you know.

You sound like Falcone.

You do not understand.

This one was meant to be real.

You do not understand.
This one was meant to be real.

They call you the miracle killer.

This one was meant to be real.

Frank.

Happy to see you again.

Hi Frank!

Thank you.

Oh Brother Thomas, it's good to see you.

It's been a long time, how are you?

Ah you know, we make it go.

Thank you.

I don't know if I'll stay
I haven't made up my mind yet.

You'll pray for me.

Thanks, I'll need it.

Father...
Yes, Frank Shore.

Roxanne O'Regan.
Of course, hello.

Hello...
Listen, I ...

Do you want to sit down?

No, no, thank you. I got your message yesterday,
I didn't even want to call back.

You preferred to come in person.

Yes that's it. Yes.

Because I want you to understand
one thing, this ... this ... this

idea you have of my mother being a saint.

It's uh pathetic. You understand ?

And your colleague, the Father uh ...

Father Panak?
Panak, that's it.

He's pathetic too.
Really pathetic.

You like that word.

He used to bring me donut holes.

You see. What would you call that?

I don't know Father Panak.

Neither your mother, or at least not yet.

Oh ok...
Are you going to get to know her now?

Yes, this is my job.

Some job.

Donuts holes, eh?

Yeah, I swear.

Can I ask you
questions about your mother?

You didn't just hear me?
No !

Give me a second and
take a look at it.

All these people prayed to your mother, okay?

There are a lot of nonsense,
but look.

Martin Wade, his white blood cell count
was less than 1000, which is serious,

his condition was very worrying.
Oh !

He prayed to your mother.

His wife rubbed his chest with
earth from your mother's grave.

It's silly, it's superstition
or whatever you want,

but his blood cell count
whites went back to near 3000.

Doctors found
no explanation for that.

Do I have to listen to more of this?

because if there is a law
which forces me to listen to you ...

No, you don't have to.
Oh !

I'm not a cop.
My father was, I am a priest.

This is where I'm supposed to say
that you don't look like a priest?

It's Brother Thomas, he's been deaf since
his earliest childhood.

Sorry for him.
No, Roxanne.

He's never known anything else.

Do you have 2 minutes?
I would like to show you something.

Okay? It won't take long.

Father Panak filmed this a few days
before your mother died.

Jacadi said ...

Hold.

Pull your ears.

Jacadi said stick out your tongue ...

Look.

Jacadi said shake your head.
An ordinary woman.

Jacadi said jump in the air!

Jacadi said clap your hands.

And hit yourself on the head.

How about singing?

Is that what a saint looks like?

Can't you see her goddamn halo?

I am surrounded by people who revere
the ground she walked on.

I'm not asking you to be part of it.

What are you asking me then?

Miracles are nothing if
she was not a good woman.

I couldn't tell you
if he was a good woman.

She moved to the convent
when I was ... 16 years old.

She cared more about the church and
of the priest than of me.

So, what's your opinion !
Does that make her a good person?

Did she care more for the priest?

Oh, boy.

Oh you so we can really say
that you have a twisted mind.

What?

Oh nothing, you're just suggesting that my mom and
Panak were having an affair, right?

This was the case ?

What is wrong with you?

If you're can't make her a saint,
you make her a slut, is that it?

Jeanne Françoise de Chantal,
an 18th century Frenchwoman

She wanted to enter the convent
but she had a 10 year old son.

When she tried to go, he screamed, cried ...

he lay down in front of the convent to
prevent her from passing and she stepped over him.

100 years later, the church made her a saint.

The Church did?

What would you have done?

I do not know.

You don't know?

No.

Besides, I would like to know,
what is a saint?

A saint is a person who is
with God in Heaven.

If you ever pray to this person,
and your prayers are answered,

that means that this person
has a special connection with God.

That she managed to persuade
God to answer your prayers.

What are you trying to tell me?

That you believe this woman
is in heaven and she ...

that she gently tap on the shoulder of God and that she whispers

"You should hear the prayers of these people"?

Do you really believe in all of this?

Huh?

You ask tough questions.

You look like her.

I take after my father.

Pan! Pan!

Kid, do you know where the Witkowskis live?

Over there.
Thank you.

Mrs. Witkowski?
I am Father Shore.

Father Panak said you would come.
He could have told me when.

I tried to call you but the phone ...

It was cut off.

I wanted to talk to Maria,
is she here?

Bless this house!

Bless it, father.

Please.

I don't see her any more.
She doesn't live here?

I don't know where she lives.

She hasn't been coming since her boyfriend and her realized I was broke.

Is this her ?

She is 16 now.
A 16 year old whore.

What do you mean ?

I know the scum she hangs out with.

All these pimps and junkies
near the Réo restaurant.

Are you really sure she ...
I can smell it, Father.

If you want my opinion,
God wasted a miracle.

Do you know Maria Witkowski?

Can you help me, am I looking for someone?

I said "Can you help me"?

It's not cool what you're doing, man.
Her name is Maria Witkowski.

Not know.

Who the fuck are you? Are you a cop?

Who are you then?

I'm looking for a girl who
is called Maria Witkowski.

There's no one called that here.

No matter what name I give you

you will always answer me the same thing, right?

You might be right ...

Thanks anyway.

Where are you running like that?

I see...

You know, we really get lots of Marias.

If you're not an asshole cop
can I know who you are then?

In reality, I am a priest.

What's the matter ?
She missed mass, the bitch?

She was very ill.

And could still be.

My name is Franck Shore,
I am in Saint Stanislas.

This church ... is the one where
my old woman is going to pray for me.

It's good, everyone should have
someone who prays for him.

My Father ... Are all these miracles true?

Fuck, yes, they're real.

I believe in all this bullshit.

Shut up, Wayne.

Are they true, Father?

You heard Wayne.

See you later.

Yeah, whenever you want.

My father.
I get it.

Go buy yourself some food, okay?

What did you just do with that dollar?

I thanked the Lord.

Did Higgings show you this?
Hey man, you know Higgings?

Did you mean "knew"?

Higgings died not long ago.

You knew Higgings.

He was so cool.

If you ever see Maria ...

Okay ?

Father Shore, Saint Stanislas.

What are you doing ?

Excuse me for disturbing you.

Frank ...

Bishop.

Take that smile off your face.

The body is the temple of the spirit.

I would like to know how you found me.

A tip from Sister Margaret.

Want a reason not to go to Heaven?
That nasty little busybody will be there too.

What do you need, Frank?

Keep you informed about Helen O'Regan.

Why, does she ... give back sight
to the crippled and make the blind walk?

Aren't you laughing? It means that
do you think there is some truth in all this?

I do not know what to think.

So think about people, I don't want to
that they begin to worship a statue.

But I am thinking of people, Monsignor.

What do you need ?

More time and more resources.

I need someone full time
to help me with this investigation.

Leone should do the trick,
I'll fix it with the university.

No, no, not Leone.

I thought you were friends?
I have another candidate.

There you are, Bishop.

Perfect. Submit a budget to Sister Margaret,
I will sign it.

Great, thank you.

You not finished yet, Monsignor?

Hi Jack, not yet.
I'll wait for you by the pool.

See you soon.

Excuse me, it's Jack De Sica.

One of the most powerful men in Chicago.

From DiSica Contracting?
Yes, the biggest in town.

He is organizing a charity gala on Thursday evening.
Bigshots, $ 5,000 per person.

Do you want me to come?

You express yourself well,
you are not a sissy,

you are not like the Mother Superior,
who wants to teach the Bible to the little pagans.

Monsignor, I ...

This kind of secular support has
never hurt a career, Frank.

You thought I didn't think anymore
to your career, to your rise?

Cardinal Humas still speaks of how you handled yourself in the Falcone case.

Have you had time to go through the file?

I read every word of it.

So ? It interests you ?

It's impressive.

And poetic too, the rain,
it gives a nice touch.

Apparently, Brother Superior consented
to grant you sabbatical leave.

He didn't have much of a choice,
he received a call from the cardinal himself.

So the only question is ...

The only question is:
Why are you doing this?

Come back here after all this time?

I need your help.

My help?
Why me ?

Thank you.

I inquired about you and,
I found out that you studied

canon law at Seaton Hall before you took  your your vows.

What I want to know is why me?

I owe you a debt.

If I helped you for Falcone,
it was unwittingly and you know it.

Yes, I know.

But I took something away from you.

This is a chance to get it back, maybe.

You are aware that we have
no birth certificate.

Only his passport mentions
his date of birth in 1933.

An incomplete file is often frowned upon.

I will inquire with
of the Austrian Consulate.

They are more numerous than usual.
Wonder what's going on.

Maybe something's about to happen.

Maria?

Hi.

Are you Father Shore?

Who told you that I was looking for you?
Wayne?

No. It's Miller.

Oh, Miller, yeah.

I'm investigating the life of a
woman you knew.

Helen O'Regan.

She saved my life.
Really ?

And she also knew things, Father.

For example, she knew
when my mother beat me.

Did your mother beat you?

no big deal.

Therefore...

one day I was sick, and ...

my mother forgot to come get me.

Helen walked me home.

This is where she saw the marks
on my face, you know.

Lupus?

Yes.

She touched me.

What?

I have to go.
Find Wayne?

When Helen died ...

that morning, do you remember?

I don't know anymore uh ...

It was raining.

I prayed.

Did you pray for Helen?

When a person dies, we pray
for his soul, is that what you did?

I do not remember.
You prayed to her?

Maria?

Can you tell me about the statue?

Listen, I have to go.

It's nothing, it's nothing!
What do you want, I must

Stay here, I can help you, okay?
I don't need any help.

Yes, we all need it, you know.
Maria, wait.

What?
Calm down, okay?

Whore !
Now that's enough, stop!

Enough, stop!
Tell me where I can find you.

Whore !
Now that's enough, stop!

Fuck it! Leave me alone !
Stop that !

Shut up ! That's enough !

Stop!

Stop!

One last question.

Okay ?

You did not pray to God, but to Helen.

Helen loved me.

God loves you.

I've never seen him, God.

You prayed for her to heal you
and she did.

No...

I prayed to die.

Credo.

Credo. quia ...

Frank.

Creed quia ...

I believe, I believe because it's ...

I believe which is impossible.

I believe because it is impossible.
Tertullian.

Frank? Are you OK ?

Where does faith go, do I ask?

Jack.

Frank ... you fool.

You come completely drunk in
my confessional, frankly ...

I am sorry.

In that flop house where I found you, you ...

No no no. In that stinking shithouse,
that's how Cahill said.

At least you weren't drinking there.

There at least I had
not to pretend to be a priest.

How? 'Or' What ?

How does faith escape us, John?

Is it like someone
who decides not to be a lawyer anymore?

Or who is no longer in love with his wife?

How would I know?

All I know is that ...

you and me, we might look damn
cons if we die and there is nothing after.

Don't you want to stop for 5 minutes, Frank?

We already discussed it, that's the kind of bullshit
that we tackle in the 1st year of the seminar.

When is she leaving
do we want to regain our freedom?

Because I will give up everything. Absolutely
all !

Absolutely everything !

I will give up, I will give up everything!

I don't want it to have been
for nothing, that's all.

I want this to be true.

The miracle ?

And everything else is, let it be true, John!

What can I do for you,
Frank, how can I help you?

I don't believe you can
do anything for me.

May the Lord Jesus Christ absolve you.

And I, by his authority,
I absolve you from all your sins.

In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Thank you.

Wayne Strozzi.

Wayne Strozzi.

Three years in juvie.
Two arrests for drug possession.

Does he do pimping?

To tell the truth, that wouldn't surprise me.

Listen ... we got this Maria Witkowski's description.

We will pick her up from time to time
to make sure she's okay.

Every now and then?

We can't do more, Frank.
Even for you.

Thanks, I'll owe you that.

I did not do anything !
They all say that ...

I did not go through red,
It switched to orange.

It was red!

Get your dirty paws off me!
I am a model citizen!

Roxanne!

Yes, who runs red lights!

Roxanne!

I thought you weren't a cop?

My father worked here.

Ah really ?

Is she making your life difficult, Herman?
Altercation with a motorist.

She fought with Parotsky.
They say I ran a red light.

Parotsky? You chose to
do you fight with the biggest cop on the force?

Is she a friend of yours?

Herman, we're like this.

Thanks Herman.
Nothing Miss.

Thank you.

What brings you here?

I have to go somewhere.
How would you like to come with me?

They put down all their stuff.

Without even wondering who is going to clean it up.

There are a lot of people who love your mother.

Seriously?

A thorn !

We used to do this when the
planes were passing over the house.

You and your mother?
Yes.

She often told me a story ...

about her childhood in Europe.

The town where she lived was being bombed

But she prayed ...

The bombs have been dropped
but never touched the ground.

At least, that's what she was telling me.

Really ?

It probably means that his family
was spared, but since ...

we are terrified of planes.

I thought you didn't want
not talk about your mother?

Did I say that?
Yes.

I never wonder why
I do what I do.

I see.
What?

Nothing, I just like the sound of that.
Never question yourself.

You should try.

I have done this before and it rarely succeeds.

I guess I could try again.

And why not give this a try?

You always carry
vodka in the cemetery?

It's kind of a tradition that I have!

I like having a drink with my mother
on the anniversary of her death.

Are you joining me?
Okay.

To Helen.

To Helen.

Why are you a priest?

Why do you want to know?

Because I can tell you like this.

Forget it, it's not my business.
No, it's okay, it's nothing.

Have you ever had girlfriends?
Or you have overcome your urge to ...

I am not a virgin if it is
what you want to know.

Yes, basically.
At Monsignor Dolan high school, I ...

Dolan?
Yes.

I went to Mont Sainte Marie.
We often went to dances there.

You had to change buses 3 times.

Did you dance or watch?

I danced from time to time.

Really ?
Yes.

You are serious ?
Yes, I was dancing.

I was not yet a priest
in high school, let me tell you

Are priests allowed to dance?
Yes of course.

Simply, it's not every day
that an opportunity presents itself.

Show me.

If you want.

Groovy.

You know it's going back up
in the early 1950s.

You are doing well.
What is it called?

It is not very complicated.

It's graceful, I think.
And light yes.

You know what ?
No ?

I'm sure you had to
be very lively, right?

My favorite dance was "the elevator".

What is "the elevator"?

No steps.

I like "the elevator" too!

Let's go somewhere else.

Can I help you ?

No it's OK. It will act as a counterweight.

I just always...

imagined that there was
something else out there.

I have never been anywhere.

That's why I
became a travel agent.

Where would you like to go?

I would like to go everywhere.

Anywhere in fact.
Somewhere.

You always want to know
why did I become a priest?

God didn't call you?

I suppose so, in his own way.

I was 17.

And my father was a policeman.

That you know.

He had to raise me alone,

my mother died when I was 5 years old.

He took a bullet in the neck
during his service.

I went to the hospital.

He was dying.

I prayed and I swore ...

that if God let him live,
I would agree to become a priest.

And 10 minutes later,
the doctors said ...

"It's incredible, we've never seen anything like this before"!

My father had made it out.

So you kept the promise
that you had made.

Yes, right, I did.

I entered the seminary, I took
my vows, I put the collar on.

Three months later, my father died.

It seems that God, him,
did not hold his end.

I do not know. I was so
angry with him.

Well no, not angry, but rather ...

totally lost, confused.

This is where I realized
that God does not bargain.

God is God.

He was just trying
to put me to the test.

And my mother ?

Where does she fit into all of this?

I want god to show me
his face again.

What if he didn't have a face?

All your life you've been more
worried about a dead woman than a living one?

Maybe you are afraid.

I'm afraid, indeed ...

I'm really scared of ...

falling in love with you.

I'm afraid of that too.

Should I go?

Please don't go!

Let me watch you.

I want to look at you.

Oh how beautiful you are.

Is everything alright ?

Huh, are you okay?

Oh yes.

It couldn't get any better.

Hold me tight.

It is raining.
I have to go to the church.

What?

I've got to go.

Oh no !

I have to.

You will come back ?
Huh?

Yes. Yes.

I will be back.

Okay ?

You promise me ?
Yes, I promise.

I promise you.

I will be back.

Helen is with us! She is here
with us as always!

Helen is with us! She is here
with us as always!

Father, can you tell us
explain what's going on?

Father Shore!

The statue is said to be crying blood,
is this the truth?

No journalists!
Come, my Father. Let's go!

Are you Reverend Paul Panak?
Yes, it's me, it's my parish.

No photos and no television!

I don't take orders 
from you, this is my parish!

Father, I don't have time to discuss.

Listen, I told them
to come, I invited them.

It's encouraging worship, I can close down
the Ordinary Process here and now!

When the statue weeps tonight
try to silence me!

Frank, over here!

My Father, tell us
when it started.

It was 7 years ago ...

What's up ?

Nothing yet, where were you,
have I looked for you everywhere?

I present to you Father Burke, he works
in the Chemistry department in Loyola.

Nice to meet you !

You have already been confronted
to a case like this?

Yes, half a dozen times.

It's called "The Pig Fat Patrol".
It's a common trick.

The statue is smeared with pork grease
, which mixes with the rain ...

and then it looks like blood, yeah, I know.

Helen!

His blood !

Helen is with us.

Helen is here!

Helen is with us!

Bring a ladder!

She comes !

No no no.

No no no, not yet.

Frank ... that's Burke's job.

Good evening.

But who do I see, Frank!
You came.

Glad to see you.
What a circus in Saint Stanislas last night!

The press was more reserved this time.
I recognize your style there, well done!

Precisely, we should be talking about last night.

Your Eminence, may I introduce you,
Father Frank Shore?

Your Eminence.
Glad to meet you, father

Please let me introduce you to
Archbishop Werner,

who is part of the congregation
for the cause of the Saints in Rome.

The Archbishop is in America
to give some lectures.

I see.

You may have heard of
the cause of Helen O'Regan?

Yes.
Father Shore is our Postulator.

So we have to consider
to have another American Saint?

I really appreciate your country.

You now have several
world class orchestras.

I even heard that there was one or
two decent restaurants in San Francisco.

That's wonderful.

But I doubt this is fertile enough soil for sainthood to grow.

Helen was not born American,
as you surely should know.

Yes, I was told she was a
street urchin, originally from Austria, right?

That's right.

It is understandable that
the congregation would be slow

to recognize the existence of new saints.

Think again, I support several
causes like that of this Belgian priest

Father Kurtswall for example, a man
of great wit and learning.

And of great heroic virtue,
without a doubt.

The Nazis martyred him for having
preached against the persecution of the Jews.

But...

I'm sure your little housewife
was just as courageous.

We haven't decided yet
to urge her cause, Monsignor.

Perfect. I advise you to consider very carefully

before spending the congregation's time.

Thanks, I have to go.

A brilliant man.

Excuse me your Eminence.

I have something to say to both of you.

The statue shed tears last night.

According to Loyola's lab,

it was group A blood,
the same as Helen's.

You are wrong, young man.

I beg your pardon ?

Wrong to let me know this way.

I rely on Bishop Cahill
in these matters.

Sorry, your Eminence.
What did I tell you?

What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

Sorry, I wanted ...
What did I tell you?

Sorry, I'm sorry but Father Shore,
there is an urgent call for you.

Excuse me.

How can you tell who it is?

Any idea who could have done this?

We're looking for a junkie named Miller.

Neighbors saw him rabbit.

Miller, yes.

They were stoned, and there are
syringes all over the place.

She was hurt too, Father.

Where is she?
She's in Southside General.

Frank.
What?

She'll die there.

Take Father Shore to Southside.

My God.

Can I ask you something ?
Of course.

When you needed a second on this investigation,

why didn't you want me?

You really think it's
the time to talk about this?

If you think I'm Cahill's man,
you're wrong, you're wrong, Frank.

I'm on your side, old man, on your side.
How about trying to be independent?

Listen ... John, what I need on this case,

it's someone who wonders if
God is here or not,

that's all that matters to me.

You stopped asking that question long ago.

Frank ... Frank.

Do you remember ?
What?

When you took your vows?
Yes.

What did you feel then, do
you remember?

They were very strong feelings, right?
Like ... emotion, pride!

Like ... emotion, pride!

Fear.

And joy....joy.

It has never left me, Frank.

I don't need to ask myself questions.

Because I know.

Good for you.

I'm sincere, good for you.

You're a lucky guy.

Make a wish.

Think about what you
most want in the world.

Think of something really good.

Open your hand!
Let go of the balloons!

I'm asking you if it's right ...

if you servant Helen would need me ...

among all men.

Her heart was made of love ...

and I...

Oh, sweet Jesus.

I'm not even a good priest.

Make me worthy.

Helen, make me worthy.

Hello.
Hello.

Do you want to go inside?

You could book a couple of
tickets for a saint I know.

Santa Monica.

Saint Kitts.

If only...

Something is wrong ?

I will recommend that Rome
hear your mother's cause.

We will submit a "Positio".

This is an account of her virtuous life
and ...

all miracles performed in her name.

If it's approved, there will be a tribunal.

We risk waiting a long time for the answer.
It can take years.

Should I be happy?
No. I didn't expect you to be.

Do you want me to be happy for you?

I will have to...

prepare to defend her cause.

So God won?

Forgive me.

My friend Jean ...

She wants to become Catholic and you want to know Why ?

She says Catholics ...

can do anything they want ...

and that they just have to go to the confessional ...

and say some
hail Marys to be forgiven.

Well, it was a real kick.

Mr. Priest, the holy man.

I am not a holy man.

No. You're not.

You're like everyone else, Frank.

Roxanne.

What could I possibly do to hurt you?

Nothing at all, absolutely nothing at all.

No, don't ... go....



Please.

Why don't you give me
a hint what's in there?

I did my best, Your Excellency.

Don't give me "Excellence"!
Am I going to like what I'm going to read or not?

Whether you like it or not, this is the truth.



The body of Christ.

The body of Christ.
Amen.

The body of Christ.
Amen.

The body of Christ.
Amen.

Frank? Frank?

What's the matter ?

The Vatican is sending an investigative
tribunal

to see if the church is willing
to advance Helen's cause.

So fast ?

Rome is finally catching up
on the rest of the world, God be praised.

It is only a preliminary tribunal,

but they're sending bigwigs:

2 cardinals, theologians of the
Congregation for the Cause of the Saints.

Your holy housewife is causing a sensation.

I guess so.

You've seen them send a tribunal
on the road, like that?

No.
No never

This is undoubtedly because the devil's advocate they want is here in the United States.

And who is he? You know it ?
Werner.

The German?
German.

The one that we met?
Yes, the one we met at the gala.

You can get him, Frank.
You can get him.

Have the cardinals arrived?

Yes, Wednesday morning.

There is Nola from Rome, and Sarrazin from Leon.

This bleeding statue, are you willing to go 5 minutes out of the way?

Bless me Father!

Werner has a doctorate
in theology and canon law.

He writes in all the languages ??of Europe,

18 years with the Congregation
for the Propagation of the Faith.

He should be a cardinal.

Why isn't he?
Too unpredictable. He scares them.

Yes, well he scares me too.

Please have a seat.

Our task is twofold.

First, determine if the
servant of God, Helen O'Regan ...

practiced virtue to a heroic degree;

then, to look in miracles,
the special favor of God to her.

We have read the Positio written
by the Postulator-Advocate

Father Francis Xavier Shore.

Your Eminence.

It is a learned and pious document.

Thank you.

Monsignor Archbishop Werner ...

Yes.
Our dear friend.

As a promoter of faith, you
you oppose the cause of this woman.

Yes, your Eminence.

We can start.

We live in a fallen world.

Martyrdom, with its great and defined
acts of faith seem impossible today.

So much so that acts of simple kindness
like the opening of a soup kitchen

or generosity
towards the most deprived

have come to appear worthy of a saint.

But true sainthood
is of another world

Let's start with the beginning,
Helen O'Regan was married.

Now, the Father's document
Shore makes no

reference to the obstacle that marriage
creates between the soul and God!

Because I see no obstacle.
Do you think sex is not an obstacle?

No.

Contamination of the mind
by the flesh either?

No.

Respectfully, your Eminences.

It has been many centuries since the church has regarded the human body as

being a vehicle of sin.

You yourself are single,

don't you approve of the Council of Trent
who says celibacy is the most blessed state?

All I'm saying is that there have been married saints.

Saint Elisabeth of Hungary, Saint Monica
and our Saint Elisabeth Seton.

The exceptions mark the rule,

except that it was more than a soup kitchen Elisabeth Seton founded,

but a powerful religious order.

"The union between man and wife is
the first link in human society. "

Such that even for the youth, there is still the odor of charity

between husband & wife. ”Of course.

We read Saint Augustine,
Father Shore, so what's your point?

The "odor of charity" is my point.

Your Eminence.

Yes, Helen was married.

Let me tell you about her marriage.
Her husband died of cancer

For 7 years, she stayed by his side
while his body was degrading.

She was tireless, and even happy
to clean up the stink and mess of his sickness

because she loved him.

The Archbishop says
that's an obstacle. But...

she took care of others, in the same way that
she took care of her husband.

Your Eminence, we have many
saints who have spent their lives in chaste prayer.

God blessed their piety.

But Helen is a people's saint.

The people who live in the ordinary world.

Let them have her blessing.

Let them have their Saint.

Is a Chicago woman
to become the next saint?

This is what is being decided at the moment
even at the Cathedral of the Holy Name

within a grand jury
Roman Catholic prelates

which held its first meeting today.

The woman in question,
the late Helen O'Regan,

was a working parishioner
at the Saint Stanislas church

and whose death had aroused
much excitement among the faithful.

Has not yet let anything filter.

We will have to wait as long as it takes for an official press release from ...

Bystrica.

It indicates the origin on the pottery
sold to tourists.

Bystrica is in Czechoslovakia, in the
Slovak part. We were looking in Austria.

Yes, because Helen was from Austria.

And this is where the story of
Roxanne could not stand up because

the city that Helen was supposed to come from
has never been bombed.

But was Bystrica?

Yes, Bystrica was?
Yes, this whole area was bombed.

How'd you get that out of the daughter, anyway?
She refused to cooperate!

If this story is true ...

It's a fairy tale that his mother
told to keep her from being afraid.

Maybe, but if it were true?

I don't know, and even
if her passport was ...

What, what about her passport?
Are you hiding something from me?

I don't want to give you false hope.

I think I could probably handle it, so what is it?

I told you that there was
no birth certificate.

Yes, so ?

The Austrian consulate put me in touch with
the hall of records of where she was supposed to be from.

No trace of her birth,
nor any Helena Gabor anywhere.

She could very well have been born elsewhere,
as for example here in Slovakia.

That would explain why no one
never heard her speaking German.

Yes maybe but listen ...

the Gabor family with whom she immigrated had only one child, one boy

but the US military issued
a passport to four of them,

including Helen.

They processed refugees by the boatload.

Most of the papers were a mess.

Okay, but what are you saying, anyway?

That parents, and the whole family, lied in
saying she was their daughter?

Why would they do that?

Does your order have people over there?
In Austria ?

No, forget Austria!
It's Slovakia?

The church is under siege by the communists,

you are going to have to find someone
who speaks the language to guide you.

I'll find someone, but why?

Because the answer lies
there, where this statue comes from.

Where the bombs actually fell.

And what am I supposed to find?

Maybe the real
identity of Helen O'Regan.

Maybe even ... a miracle.

It was wonderful.
A wonderful evening. Thank you

Excellent wine.
Yes quite.

Father Shore

Did the dinner meet with your standards, your Excellency?

I'm in the heart of the American midwest
I don't expect miracles.

That's a good rule.

I don't know why you are smiling.
I do believe in miracles,

I saw one once.

Are you talking about Father Kurtswall?
No, I wasn't thinking of him.

But it's ironic, isn't it?

I firmly believe in miracles,
when you don't believe in anything.

Nothing at all.

And yet, you will do anything to prove your little housewife's miracles ...

... are real.

Am I not right?
You don't believe in anything at all.

I see why you are
called the Devil's Advocate.

Be careful, Frank.

You are all that
I was afraid you were.

Intelligent, insolent and
above all, sentimental.

It is in fact very important that you be taught a lesson.

Important to you?
No no.

Important to God's holy church. Thank you.

You are not God or his church.

Frank.
Yes, John?

You can't talk to
the Archbishop in this way.

I just did.

How are you otherwise?
Fine. What about you?

Is he your friend?
Yes, Brother Gregory, Father John Leone.

Nice to meet you, Father.
Me too. I have heard of you.

Brother Gregory helps me in my ...
I know, yes.

Yes.
I know.

Good evening.

It was interesting.

Hello.
Good evening, are you Jean?

How do you know ?
I can guess.

Roxanne!

You must be Frank.

Yes.

Thank you, Jean.
You're welcome.

I don't have to ask you if it's a bad time. Sorry.

I've heard that before somewhere.
What are you doing here ?

I need your help.

Really ? You are a goddam stubborn Irishman, aren't you?

They will talk about you tomorrow during the tribunal.

They are?

They will say your mother abandoned you.
They will present it like that.

At the same time ... that's what happened.

No. She was torn.
she was guilty.

She must have been.

They need to hear you say that.

You are really amazing.

Excuse me, I have a party to go to.

But Helen needs you

I need you.

Forgive me, Father.

Reverend Postulator, in a moment
we will hear you with interest

about Roxanne O'Regan,
Helen's only daughter but I ...

I have to ask you first
why she is not herself a witness?

She did not wish to come, your Eminence.

Oh really ?

If she had wished, would she have testified
in favor of the beatification of his mother?

Miss O'Regan thinks that
her mother abandoned her ...

to serve the church.

And you, Father Shore,
do not share this opinion?

No, I'm sure Helen wanted quite simply &
above all to be with God.

Who are you ?

I'm sorry I'm really confused
I thought it was a courtroom.

I thought I could sneak in the back, sit down and listen.

Roxanne O'Regan, your Eminence.

You finally decided to come.
You are welcome.

Take a seat, please.

Well...

I have nothing to ... I have nothing to say.
I just wanted ...

... see how you make a saint, that's all.

Miss O'Regan has no notion of
what holiness is, your Eminence.

She is not a practicing Catholic.

This is...
Yes, it's true.

How could I have a concept
of what a saint is?

Maybe you could explain it to me, Father.

Or someone else.
Your Eminence?

A Saint loves God, far beyond the
ordinary human power to love him.

A Saint is love.

You experienced the loss of love
from your mother when you were 16 years old.

I did not die of it.

Of course, but it was
a terrible loss for you.

Well yes...
I mean of course it was.

Thanks, that's all I wanted to know.

Do you know what prompted her to leave you?

No.

You still had to
ask yourself why she left you.

What was her reason?

I do not know.

But was it out of indifference?
Was it for convenience?

Or just out of selfishness?

I do not know...
I do not know.

What did she say to you?
She must have given you an explanation.

She didn't just leave like that one day, what did she say to you, Roxanne?

She...

She told me that she owed God.

Owed him?

Yes, I didn't get it then, & by the way I don't think I'll get it now either.

When she left you ...

it must have been painful.

Of course it was painful.

Do you think it was painful for her too?

I don't know if I can answer that.

Maybe, for her...

her love for god was so strong she got you
left although she loved you.

Even though she really loved you.

And that it was extremely
painful for her.

You can understand that.

You can imagine it even though
you don't understand it, do you?

I can imagine it being painful
to leave someone you love.

I can't imagine leaving your daughter.

That I can't imagine.

But that's me.

And...

God knows I'm not a saint, so ...

Yes
America ?

Yes.
Receive you collect call from Bystrica Slovakia.

Do you agree to accept charges, sir?
Okay ?

Yes Yes. Yes.

Call America.

Hello, Frank?

It's really extraordinary Frank!

Everyone here knows this story
or remembers hearing it.

Well, on the other hand, our big problem,
is that there are no eyewitnesses.

Or...

At least no one who wants to talk.

Those who agree,
their children prevent them.

They're afraid to help us Frank, they're afraid of going to church. for crying out loud!

OK now, look, look.

I know this is a problem and of course
I will continue to look,

Listen, I managed to piece together what happened, between one account & another.

It's an incredible story.

You read to write?

If there is any hope, we wish it
sustain her life, whatever the cost.

If I thought there were, Father, I would.

Madame Witkowski.

Go for it.

Is she dead?
Not yet.

Only a few more minutes.
We will leave you alone.

Lord, have mercy.

You should go on to the tribunal.

I'll stay here.

God doesn't waste miracles.

Holy Mary mother of God protect my daughter.

Holy Mary mother of God,
protect her, I beg you

Concerning the first of miracles
attributed to the servant of God,

Concerning the first of miracles
attributed to the servant of God,

the cure of Maria Witkowski ...

Yes, your Eminence.

We have your detailed story
from the day she was cured of a

terminal lupus
by the blood of Helen O'Regan

to whom the girl was in the habit of praying.

Yes, the events I learned from Maria herself.

I have here the testimony of people who have seen

Maria enter the church that morning,
covered in blood.

What looked like blood.

As a result, she recovered
in a totally inexplicable way.

Yes, your Eminence.

Forgive me, but the Consulta Medica de
the Catholic University issued a report

which confirmed that this healing could not
be explained scientifically.

Bishsop, you asked
for a review of their report.

Could we have water?

Is it that hard to make sure
that these glasses remain full?

Sorry, I have a question, I would like
find out where Maria Witkowski is now.

She ... until now,
she was in a coma,

as you know very well, Monsignor.

But this morning, about an hour ago ...

A coma ... caused by
an overdose of cocaine.

I'm trying to answer your question ...
She's a drug addict.

If we refer to the police reports,
she was suspected of prostitution, ...

ask for money for
the most degrading practice ...

We all know the definition of the word
"prostitution", Archbishop Werner.

Of course, your Eminence. I apologize.

So your Helen O'Regan
intercedes with God ...

to spare Maria so that she leads later
a life of debauchery and extreme degradation.

Is this an example of
her love, her wisdom?

It is the virtue that is
required of a Saint, Archbiship.

Not the ability to predict the future.

And we learn today
that Maria  has died.

I intended to make you
aware of this information immediately

after having received confirmation.

Dead, unrepentant in the powerlessness of sin.

How dare you say that?

How dare you sit there...?

How could you possibly know
the state of her soul?

Who are you to ...

Who do you think you are?

You are not God!

Excuse me, your Eminence.

John, what ...
Frank.

My Fathers. Your Eminence.
Come see, all of you, please.

Father Shore, Father Shore!

Good morning, John. Big crowd today.
They wanted a miracle, they got it.

Father Shore.
No questions, please.

What about the miracle?

It's a glorious day,
That's all I can say.

Frank ...

be careful today.

I spoke to the Holy See this morning.

Records of the deathbed recovery of Maria
Witkowski

are under review by the
College of Relators of Rome.

Their conclusions should
reach us within 2 days.

It will be a time of prayer for us.

Your Eminence...

Before adjourning the meeting, I would like the tribunal to know that I will continue despite everything ...

to oppose ... the beatification
of Helen Gabor O'Regan.

You are a surprise to us.
May we hear your reasons?

Yes, there are 2. The first is that

even if we accept the dubious virtue of
Helen O'Regan ...,

this case involving Maria Witkowski is but one canonical miracle.

The Canon law requires 2,
long tradition insists on 3.

My second reason touches
at the heart of these proceedings.

It is about the state of the soul of our Postulator.

I deny that God would entrust his servants' cause to a faithless priest.


To a man unable to say to us, even now ...

that he accepts the truth of God and his church!

I defy him to do so.

You doubt me.

Very well.

But why do you doubt Helen?

You saw Maria.

I don't know at all what I saw.
You saw her with your own eyes.

Perhaps it wasn't the work of God?

Father Shore.

Come closer, please.
Yes, your Eminence.

Do you hold to the truth of the Church,
one, Holy, Catholic and apostolic?

I need time, Your Eminence.
Time? For a simple declaration?

Time to pray.

No. Swear it to us, Father Shore.
Swear before God!

What good would that do?

If I didn't believe in God, why would I hesitate to swear falsely before Him?

That's too clever, my son.

Help me before I start to
share the doubts of the Archbishop.

I have struggled with my faith, your Eminence.

But what does this have to do
with the virtue of this woman?

If God chooses to trust His cause to a ...

to a priest like me ...

But would God do so?

Who knows the will of God?

You, Archbishop?

Do you?
Do you?

God has given me doubts. Yes.

But he also gave me Helen.

I believe that.

We will meet again tomorrow.

Not a single real witness, Frank.

No.

No, I failed you.

Your Eminence, I am compelled to bring one final matter before you.

Your Eminence, I am compelled to bring one final matter before you.

I admit, not having the proper evidence.

I had hoped that with a little time ...

But I'm not asking for more time.

I have failed to defend
the cause of Helen Gabor O'Regan

because of the weakness of my faith.

But I'm not willing to remain
silent...

about a great miracle
of which she was part.

I protest.
Of course you do.

Are we to hear the story
of a miracle without proof?

It's all childishness,
a whim, nothing else.

Your Eminence, I implore you to ...

Conti
nue.

I'll start with a discrepancy of fact dating 
from when Helen was naturalized.

Her maiden name was not Gabor,
as we thought.

She was also not from Austria.

It may not seem important ...

Nothing under the heavens is unimportant.

But why did her family change her name?

Her family were gypsies who were on the run from the nazis.

Helen was lucky,
didn't look like a gypsy,

her father gave her to a family
of non-gypsies named Gabor.

She stayed with them and kept
their name when they arrived in America.

Her real name was Helena Kralova
of Bystrica in Slovakia.

How are you, Monsignor?
Do you want some water?

No, no, thank you.
It's good, it will be fine, thank you.

The...

August 9, 1944

an American bomber squadron
under allied command

were strafing several factory towns where German troops were stationed.

Among them was Bystrica.

According to accounts, while
the bombers were approaching,

a child, Helena, fled from her
father as well as a young priest

who also tried to catch her.

She ran to the church,
knelt down and started to pray.

Your Eminence...

Your Eminence I ...

Let me ...

I would like to ... Let me ...

Is the Archbishop
not feeling well ?

Your Eminence, I think we
should suspend the meeting,

Monsignor Werner is not feeling well.

I...

We will suspend the meeting.

Hoping that his Excellency
Archbishop Werner will be better tomorrow.

Yes, I will be much better tomorrow,
thank you, give me this cane.

Yes?

This way.

Thank you.

Ah, it's you.
Preposterous.

What? Bystrica's miracle?

No no. The idea that God made you his
messenger, you are preposterous.

1944, where were you in 1944?

I was a child. At the time,
I was in 4th grade.

I'm more than tired of trying
to explain the war

to your generation of insolent people,
but without results.

Really i'm tired altogether.

It's to tell me what you got me
brought here, in the middle of the night?

Bystrica was a filthy factory town.

Apart from the gypsies or the communists ...

there were only ignorant peasants ...
came from the countryside to work in the ...

ammunition factories.

There was no decent meal there,
no companion worthy of sharing it.

The air was only smoky.

The buildings had the color
rotten straw.

You were there.

Yeah, yeah, I was.

You like to say "Let God be
God, we are not to judge for him. "

You were there, weren't you?

What did you see ?

Did you see the miracle?

No, it was a thoughtless miracle.

Reckless and unreasonable.

to grant a little gypsy girl's wish to be

spared, she and her
family while ...

millions more have died.

A whim of God.

And I would tell God if he was in
this room, yes I would tell him!

And he isn't in this room?

Don't play with me.

We are not standing before some drunken fool Sarrazin.

We are facing only our own consciences.

God gave us custody of the church for safe keeping.

We have to live among the people
of this world, and judge of ...

what is best for them to hear,
or not to hear.

And this miracle ...

... it is not good for them to
hear. Not good at all.

And who were you?
You were the priest, right?

Communists destroyed the archives
from the church, we couldn't find him.

Was that you?

You told me...
I remember ...

that once you had seen a miracle.

I no longer know what I saw.

Yes you did.

Yes you do.

Tell me.

What did you see, Archbishop?

Tell me what you saw.

You said...

that only two people witnessed the miracle, the priest and the father of the child.

But in reality a third
who also saw the girl.

A German army soldier.

A most hardened skeptic.

He watched the little girl pray, and then ...

he watched the bombs.

the bombs fell ...

and turned into a vast flock of birds

the most peaceful there is.

Pigeons.

Thousands.

I had never seen so many.

Before or since.

I have never seen so many pigeons.


Watch out for the door!

We'll take a picture before you
go away.

Don't be afraid, the little ones in front.

Everyone in the frame.
Keep your beautiful smiles.

Everyone say "Monkey"!
Monkey!

Everyone says "Chickens"!
Smile!

Cheese!
Cheese!

Its good.

Great, well done everyone.

Trevor, you sang really well today!

Thank you so much.

Hello ! Hello...

Roxanne?

Frank?

What are you doing here ?
In this neighbourhood ?

I live here now.

I needed less rent
expensive and a little more space.

It's yours ?
Yes, yes, it's my daughter.

She is magnificent.

So ?

Does my mother
became a saint?

We have two miracles,
Maria and the bombing of Bystrica.

The church doesn't like to talk about Bystrica but they're counting it..

We're waiting for a third.

And you're a priest?

Yes.

And you're a mother.

Yes.

Yes, I am a mom.

She is really adorable.

Thank you.

I will hurry to bring her back
at home before it rains.

Yes my dear, we are going.

Glad to see you.
Yes me too.
