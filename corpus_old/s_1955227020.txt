[Bell ringing]

[Crowd noise]

Get up.

Get up.

Get up!

[Machine gun fire]


[Crowd jeering]

MAN IN CROWD: Get up!
Get up!

Get up!

I own you, kid.

Do you have any
idea how much money

You've cost me because
you've decided to give up?

I'm sorry, Mr. Regetti.

You're havin' those
bad dreams again, right?

I kept seeing her in that ring.

Shh.

Shh.

She wasn't in the ring.

But you don't understand.

You had him beat!

Learn to listen to
me more carefully,

Or you're not going
to listen at all.

I'll tell you what.

After you heal up, I want
you to come and visit me.

I'm going to give you
another fight in the ring.

I can't fight no
more, Mr. Regetti.

Well, I can't fight no more.

Shh shh.
It's OK.

It's OK.
You sit down.

It's all right, baby.

Hey, boys.

It's OK.

I'm gonna leave now.

DR. MAY: I don't
have answers, Cajun.

Maybe I could stay here
for a little while longer.

DR. MAY: A month
is all you needed.

And tomorrow that time is up.

But there ain't
nothing changed.

Well, the only way you
can solve this problem

Is to be on the outside.

You could make it out
there, and you know it.

All you have to do is
put your past to sleep.

They're still looking
for me out there.

You have friends, a
job, a place to stay.

It's more than most vets.

Life is a very precious
commodity, Cage.

What we try to
accomplish here is

To replace negatives with hope.

Oh, you'll do fine.

You'll get a job.

You have a very nice
friend in that young lady

Who's coming to pick you up.

And you'll get well.

Be happy, Cage.

Just be happy, being alive.

I must go.

Doc.

You can come back
to visit anytime

That you feel closed in.

And besides, we have a
session scheduled in a month.

So I can come back
and stay anytime if I...

No.

Visit.

Come and see your friends,
have a session with me,

And then go home.

I'm scared, damn it.

Why don't you go
and say goodbye

To Legs before your friend
comes to pick you up?

Because he never
comes to visit me.

Why don't you just go down
there and bring him up

So we can say goodbye?

Can't do that just yet.

His condition keeps
him in his room.

But I'm sure he'd like
to see you before you go,

Don't you think?

Yeah.

Yeah, sure.

I'll see you in a month.

Take care of yourself.

OK?

[Guitar playing]

I thought you went home.

Without saying goodbye
to my old buddy?

No way.

Figured you forgot.

Say, Legs.

You dress up just
to see me off, boy?

Now, I can't very well just
jaunt on outside, now can I?

What's this?

It's your going away gift.

I can't take your guitar, man.

I want you to have it.

It's twisted out there, Cage.

Downright scary.

Hey, but when you
get out of here,

You can take this guitar, and...

No.

I won't be leaving
here for a long time.

No way.

Besides, I got another guitar.

That means so much tension.

Would you tell me just what
it is that keeps you here?

I got agoraphobia.

There's no cure.

Maybe I can help you.

I don't... I don't
need your help, dude.

I'm... I'm fine.

I'll make a deal with you.

What?

If I can make it out
there, on the outside,

You'll come visit me?

I can't do it.

I like it here.

Well, do you plan on staying
in here the rest of your life?

I've tried.

You think I haven't tried?

How long's it been since you
been out in that visiting room?

Not long.

Five years.

That's why we got to
get you out of here.

We got to get you out of here.

No, we don't gotta do nothing.

It ain't fair for
me to come back here

Every time I want to see you.

So don't come back!

Try.

For me?

Outside the world
just comes down on me.

It doesn't let up.

I can't.

It's OK.

No, it's not OK.

I can't ask you
to come back here.

I want to see you again.

But I can't ask
you to come back.

I'll come up once a week.

You better go.

I'm gonna read up on it.

What?

Agoraphobia.

Maybe someday I can help you.

Cajun?

Thanks for the guitar, man.

Are you gonna play it?

Just like when
I was a kid, huh?

Brothers.
I'll play it.

That's enough.

Hey, soldier.

You all packed and
ready to go home?

Yeah.

Where'd you get the guitar?

I thought you sold yours.

I did.

Legs gave me this one.

Come on.

Car's downstairs.

So?

Where is he?

Uh, word on the street is...

I don't give a damn about
the word on the street.

Where is he?

Uh, h-he went west.

Maybe California.

Nah, I took him
out of VA hospital.

He's probably back there.

Now, sit down.
Both of you.

He was a machine.

The best kickboxer I ever had.

Then he double-crossed me.

So what do you
want us to do, boss?

I'm gonna arrange
his last fight.

H... h... he... he
won't fight no more.

Oh, yes, he will.

He's gonna fight.

He's gonna fight.

You find him.

You call me.

Lacy told me to tell you,
your old job's waiting for you.

Hey.

Play for me.

You are gonna come back
to work, aren't you, Cage?

I guess I will.

Ali, I want to thank you for...
For being here when I need you.

How was your stay?

Did they help?

Them people don't understand...

The dreams?

No, hell.

They don't understand
how to treat a vet.

I'm scared.

They don't know scared.

I know.

Do you?

Hey, just like the hospital,
I can be your friend too,

You know.

Yeah, it's easy for you.

You know, you got
it all together.


Oh, big deal.

So I sing and play at the club.

I'm scared, too.

But I'm not giving up.

Hey, wait a minute.

I'm not giving up.

Come on, just because my
mind's on other things

Sometimes... I get caught
up in my own thoughts,

And... I guess that is
kind of selfish, isn't it?

It's all right.

I do the same thing.

Would you be there for me,
Cage, if I needed a friend?

Hey, uh... tell me something.

Who paid the rent
on my apartment

While I was in the hospital?

None of your business.

(PLAYING GUITAR)

need you B-A-D, oh, baby, I do.

I'm in L-U-V with Y-O-U.

[Crowd cheering]

need you B-A-D, oh, baby, I do.

I'm in L-U-V with Y-O-U. I
quit school when I was 12.

I can't read or write too well.

Singing songs is
one thing I can do.

I sing the words
I wrote for you.

I L-U-V Y-O-U. I need you
B-A-D, oh, baby, I do.

I'm in L-U-V with Y-O-U.
I'm in L-U-V with Y-O-U.

She sounds good tonight.

Boy, she's great.

So you guys, I, uh... I
hadn't said anything before.

But I just want to
tell you... thanks.

Yeah.

We're all glad to
have you back, Cage.

Even though your friend
Pedro, here, saved

All the hard ones for you.

Y-O-U. I'm in L-U-V with Y-O-U.

I'm in L-U-V with Y-O-U.

All right.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

All right, here's Rif Harper.

[Crowd cheering]

want to want somebody.

That's what you said.

Well, if you really want to want
somebody, why'd you run away?

Why'd you run away?

Guys, have you finished
shredding the cabbage yet?

I only got two hands.

All right.

Go ahead.

Make my coleslaw.

Hey, Cage.

How you feeling?

Just feels good to
have a job, Pedro.

That's cool.

You should have [inaudible]
more often, you see?

Just like me.

I love this place.

I love even these turkeys.

You see, I love cooking.

You wash them up.

And I mess them
up with more food!

Enjoy.

Pedro, where's the gravy?

Since when do we put gravy
on ham and hash browns, huh?

Since I wrote it on the order.

We don't have to like
it to serve it, do we?

Hey.

Hey, it's only a broken glass.

I keep seeing it, man.

It won't stop.

It'll go away eventually.

Sure, it will.

love to the beat.

Baby, you and me, keepin'
rhythm with the melody.

The radio on, playin'
love songs all night long.

Makin' love to the beat.

Hey.

I'm here.

I don't want to
become your problem.

You're not a problem.

You know, when I was a
boy, my dad used to take

Me fishing down the swamp.

Used to tell me I
could do anything

If I tried hard enough.

Well, I'm trying.

Maybe if you could
tell me what happened...

My daddy died trying to
get out of that swamp.

You're not going to die, Cage.

That's just the whole point.

What am I supposed to be doing?

Am I supposed to be a
dishwasher the rest of my life?

Or is there something
else out there?

There is.

I'll help you find it.

me feel so brand new.

I'd never needed
anyone like I need you.

I don't know how to
thank you for all the help

You've been to me tonight.

I really appreciate it.

Well, Lacy, that's
what friends are for.

By the way, that
little gal you've got?

You mean Ali?

She is really
something terrific.

I don't know what
I'd do without her.

Say, are you making ends meet?

Mm, hanging in there.

Lacy, you never were
a very good liar!

Now, look...
You taught me to lie.

I did.

Now, look, me and the
boys got to roll to Vegas.

We got... we open
there tomorrow night.

But I did find out
today that we're going

To be back in LA
for a one-nighter

At the Palace later on this...

At the Palace?

Yeah, at the Palace.

Now, look.

What I'm going to
try and do is get

The stars to come
down here to sit down

With the press and stuff like.

Try and put this
place back on the map.

That'd be great.

I know LA, Lou.

Oh, yeah?

You'll be lost in five minutes.

Not this time, Lou.

I bought one of them
little map books.

OK, big shot.

Let's see how long it takes
you to find the VA hospital.

[Guitar playing]

turn gravel into gold,

Cotton into satin, or make
diamonds out of stones,

I'd dress you in a satin gown
with golden diamond seeds.

For just one hour, you would
be this poor boy's queen.

Honey if I had to swim
across the deepest sea,

I'd do it willingly,
just to be with you.


CAGE (SINGING): I'd lay
the moon down at your feet,

And crown you with the sun.

The universe would finally
know that you and I are one.

Honey if I had to swim
across the deepest sea,

I'd do it willingly,
just to be with you.

I would walk for miles across
the burning desert sand,

Move mountains with one
hand, because I love you.

That was beaut... Cage!

That was good!

Why did you stop?

Come on!

What are you... Cage, come on.

What are you... Cage!

Would you talk to me?

Leave me alone!

No, I am not going
to leave you alone.

Why are you doing this to me?

Cage, don't be ridiculous.

Come on!

Cage.

Come on, Cage.

This is not fair
to either of us.

[Car engine starting]

Show 'em something special.

You don't think I call him
Dr. Death for nothing, do ya?

Go ahead, baby.

How do you like that?

Go ahead.

Go ahead, tell me.
All right.

Tell me he ain't ready!

He's good!
Good.

What are you
talking about, good?

He's good.
You want a... you want a drink?

Yeah.

Scotch on the rocks?

Yeah.

So, who do you
think could beat him?

Well, who's he going to fight?

Cage Damante.

The Cajun?

Yeah.

I thought he retired.

He's coming out of retirement.

If, uh... if his
life was on the line,

You think he could beat
that Dr. Death out there?

What the hell's the difference?

Cut the bullshit, Regetti.

If I bring in the
high rollers, they're

Gonna want to see a show.

Salud, [inaudible].

Yeah, salud.

We're going to give them
a show... to the death.

Ooo.

I love it.

Where?

We'll do it in LA.

How much time do I
have to arrange it?

Couple weeks.

The deal?

I'll pick the place.

I'll cover the bets.

You bring in the high rollers
and see that they get there.

We'll charter a plane.

We'll bring 'em in with
a first class ticket.

Dr. Death.

20-1.

With a 10% spread, who cares?

Don't pull that crap on me.

They're gonna want
to see a show.

At $25,000 a head and a dead
body, that's a good show.

Excuse me.

We came to visit Cage Damante.

Could you please tell
us what room he's in?

He must have checked
out last month.

The name doesn't sound familiar.

This is great, Sal.

He's got to be here somewhere.

His file has been left open.

In fact, it says right here
that he'll be back the day

After tomorrow.

I want you to meet
the new club manager.

This is, uh...

Kati Lewis.

Hi, Ali Webster.

So why the new girl?

Because I'm thinking of putting
this place on the map again.

And I felt I needed somebody
to help me with the bookings.

I see.

I don't think you do.

Wasn't I doing OK?

Ali, you been with me
for, what, for three years?

And I never heard you once
complain about the overload.

Then why are you replacing me?

Because I want you to
concentrate on your singing.

Because I hope you'll
become my permanent MC.

And I hope you'll sign
a contract with me.

A contract!

Well, the money ain't
gonna be that great.

Honey, I want you to
be my opening act,

And my closing act, from
now until next year.

That's great!

You really mean it?

Of course I'll be
your opening act!

Welcome to the big time, baby.

Welcome to the big time.

[Car honking]

Want a ride home?

I think I'd rather walk.

It's over 20 miles.

I can do it.

What's the matter, you
don't think I can do it?

Oh, yeah.
I think you can do it.

But that's not the point.

I mean, why are you paying so
much attention to me, anyway.

It's not like I'm worth it.

Well, I think you are worth it.

So get in the car.

Come on.

Get in.

Please.

I hate red cars.

ALI: Hey, you come here often?

CAGE: Only when things
start coming down on me.

It's peaceful out here.

Tell me about this
vision... these things

That you keep having.

When things start going
wrong, they just pop up.

Can't make 'em out.

It's... it's like they're in
bits and pieces, you know?

Hey, why'd it bother you when
I... when I heard you sing?

It was a private moment.

But you're good.

I liked what you were playing.

Yeah, well I ain't
ready for an audience.

Any audience.

And besides, I ain't that good.

I'm just another voice.

That is not true.

Yeah, well maybe there
ain't no helpin' me, baby.

Maybe I'm just a mess.

Of course there's help for you.

Tell me something.

What's all your
boyfriends think about you

Spending so much time with me?

There are no boyfriends.

Yeah, well maybe I just have
a hard time trusting, huh?

Well, there's a lot of
emptiness without trust.

Yeah.

Well, anybody I've
ever trusted's dead.

Daddy, my buddies in Nam.

What about Legs?

Oh, hell.

Legs don't count.

He reminds me of you.

How's Legs like me?

He wants to be all by hisself.

Don't want no company at all.

I can trust you.

Come on.

Let's go.

Will you write me a song?

And what makes you
think I can write a song?

Because I looked
through your book while

You were in the bathroom.

You looked through my book.

Well, yeah.

It was just out
there in the open.

It's like looking at a
magazine in a waiting

Room at a doctor's office.

Except it wasn't a magazine.

You always go around
looking at people's books

When they're in
the bathroom, huh?

No, it was my first time.

What time are you
going to go visit Legs?

You are changing the subject.

Yep, I am.

Would you like a
ride to the hospital?

I'll think about it.

Bingo.

I thought you were kidding
about coming to visit.

God, this is great.

How you doing, buddy?

Well, I've been seriously
thinking about starting

A patient's union around here.

How's that guitar treating you?

Well, I'm writing songs again.

Hey, but, uh... I've
been thinking about you.

You been trying to get
out of here, or what?

Well, I've been
rather busy, you know?

And besides, if I, uh... if
I go out, I need a new hat.

Well, say no more.

Well, you been talking about
getting one for a long time.

Hey, maybe now we
can take that walk?

Where?

How about down to the rec room?

It's a nice hat, Cage.

But I got nothing
white to match it.

Well, I guess there ain't no
need in me coming back here

Anymore now, then, is there?

Hey.

Hey, Cage.

What's that supposed to mean?

It's so easy for you just to
stroll on out there, isn't it?

I mean, there's nothing left
to lose for you, is there?

Look.

If you start
freaking out, you can

Always go back in your room.

But I want you to try, OK?

What if somebody sees me?

Ain't worth it.

I'm going back.

Suit yourself.

You ain't gonna meet Ali.

What is this?

Blackmail?

What makes you think
I want to meet her?

She's terrific.

She's one pretty lady, man.

She sings and plays
in this nightclub.

Club.

Yeah, the club.

That... that's the... that's
the place that you work?

Yeah.

You oughta see her.

I could... I could never get
on that stage like she does.

You gotta see her, man.

I can't even m... m... make
it down the h... h... hall.

How am I ever going
to make to that club?

Because you got
to want to do it.

You gotta want to do
it more than anything.

More than breathing.

I haven't even my jacket on.

I'm going to die right here.

I know it.
Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

You ever been in love?

Sure.

I was in love.

Sort of.

Then s... s... she left me
when I was overseas.

I can't.
I can't do it.

OK?

I can't.

I can't do it!

You know, when I was a
boy... when I was a boy,

My dad used to
tell me, son, there

Ain't no such a word as can't.

Please, Cage.

I want to go back right now.

OK?

None of this funny
business any longer, OK?

This has gone far enough.

Listen.

Just take a deep breath.

Just take a deep breath.

And we'll get you
back to the room.

I can't even move right now.

Isn't that something?

Isn't that a piece of cake?

I can't even walk back to that
room right now if I had to.

Damn it to hell.

Damn it!

What'd you bring
me out here for?

Damn it to hell.

I want you to look, buddy.

We come all that way?

That's fantastic, man.

Cage, I... I just wet my pants.

Don't you do that,
little [inaudible].

[Phone dialing]

[Phone ringing]

Yeah, Mr. Regetti?

Yeah, we found Cage.

And we found his
girlfriend, too.

I'll come pick you up later.

Let's take our
guitars to the club.

We can work on the
songs after they close.

I don't know about that.

Nobody'll be there.

Ali.

What?

Our relationship...
Is it enough?

Yeah.

I don't know when I've been so
happy and relaxed in my life.

See you later, huh?

Hey.

Tell me something.

Did you really like
that song I wrote?

I love it.

Come on.

Just try it.

You know how long it's been
since I've been on a stage?

I was a teenager.

Nobody's here.

Come on.

Let me hear that
Cajun voice of yours.

[Music playing]



mean to stare.


every part of you, from

Your head down to your toes.

part of you I love the most.

body moves when you walk by.

I love to kiss your lips
and gaze into your eyes.

You look so good,
and yet I realize...

the best part of you.

ALI (SINGING): It's
only the start of you.

the best part of you.

I want the heart of you.

[Toy machine gun]

Hey, you guys, stop it!

What are you guys doing?

Stop it!

Knock it off!

Stop it.

Where have you been?

I'm losing it, man.

All the noises.

All the helicopters.

All the faces.

You told me I was
going to be OK!

You are.

You are going to be OK.

You're going to get over
this, and leave it behind.

Now, what we need to...

We!

Damn it!

Don't use that doctor
bullshit on me.

There ain't no we.

It's me.

And I'm out there all by myself.

You don't have to
be alone now, Cage.

Isn't that what you're trying
to convince Legs not to become?

What brought this on?

They had these
little toy water guns.

They were breaking glasses.

They were laughing at me.

Ali didn't know what to do.

She said that we'd be
all alone in the club.

So we started playing
music after it was closed.

And then Pedro and
his friends came in.

And they started
squirting us with guns.

Don't you think
that they were just

Playing foolish,
innocent, childish games?

It felt so good up there
on that stage, playing.

I think that's wonderful.

How do you feel about Ali?

She's my friend.

She's probably my best friend.

Does she know about
your condition?

Have you told her?

You're not being fair.

Life isn't fair, Cage.

Life is what we make,
and do, with it.

Does she know about you?

Why's it so damn important
I bear my blood and guts

To everybody?

Because it will help you
understand more about yourself.

And... and deal with these
very difficult moments.

Yeah, but everything keeps
happening all the time.

I mean, people keep
doing all these things...

Do you really care
what other people think?

I guess it's not important.

Do you know what is important?

No, what?

Come with me.

I want you to see the
results of what you've

Done just a few days that five
long years of constant therapy

By us could not achieve.

Yeah?

Well, what'd I do?

He won't go off the floor yet.

In fact, uh, he has to be with
people to even get down here.

But he's here.

And he wouldn't be
if you hadn't open

His world back up to him again.

You opened his door to life.

Then why can't I
open my own doors?

You are, Cage.

You are more than you realize.

Come on.

I want to buy you
some breakfast.

I just want to thank you for
spending so much time with me.

Thank you for trusting us
to work on this together.

I'll see you in a month.

You bet.

Appreciate the ride.

How many players are coming?

50.

50!

At $24,000 a head!

50!

That's... that's... that's...
That's-a lot of money!

And if the fight is any
good, money's no object.

They don't care who wins!

But we do.

They think the Cajun
is our ace in the hole.

They don't know what kind
of bad shape he is, eh.

But we know.

They're gonna put the
money on the Cajun.

And our guy, Dr. Death, is going
to beat the shit out of him.

We're all set.

I'll make all the arrangements.

We're on.

We are on.

You sound like you're trying
to break it off with me.

Don't.

I'm trying to tell
you something.

Hey.

What am I missing?

Cage, look at me.

What do you see?

I see a beautiful woman.

A woman I want so desperately
to fall in love with.

Then what's stopping you?

Is it me?

Is it what I'm not
doing with you?

Is it?

You got this all wrong.

That's great.

You can't fall in love with me
because... when I was younger,

I honestly thought
I'd meet Mr. Right.

He'd sweep me off my feet.

We'd get married and have kids.

Live happily ever
after under God's eye.

Joke's on me, isn't it.

I can't be Mr. Right.

Why?

I'm so in love with you, Cage.

I want to be in love
with my best friend.

I want to get married.

And just take the rest
one step at a time.

I never been very romantic.

Maybe you never
had a reason to be.

Maybe.

Hey, you said you wanted
to fall in love with me,

Didn't you?
Yeah, but-

No buts.

And besides...

What?

I think you are
the most romantic

Man I've ever met in my life.

[Music playing]

[Knocking on door]

Ali?

Is that you?


Get him up.

Mr. Regetti would
like to see you.

Yeah?

Well I don't want to see him.

I could hurt you real bad.

[Car horn honking]

Hey.

Hey look at me, will ya?

I don't give a damn
about Vietnam or anything

You did there.

I keep fight no
more, Mr. Regetti.

Look, why don't you boys
just leave me alone, huh?

Come here.

It's money.

Hm?

You understand money?

I arranged a very
special fight for you.

And you're the star attraction.

Ain't gonna be much of a fight.

Get him up.

I'm through fighting, damn it.

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Oh, hi, Lacy.

Oh, sure.

Why do you want to
see me so early?

All right.

I'll be right down.

Bye.

All I want you to
do is think it over.

OK?

Think it over.

I don't need to.

I've thought about it.

OK.

Take your time.

I'll give you a couple days.

I'll come back tomorrow.

And we'll discuss the details.

Mr. Regetti.

What happens if I
don't change my mind?

I'm going to kill you.

Hm.

Anyways, so because of the, uh...

Great.

Is it?

Honey, because of the
fire at The Palace

I offered the stars our place
for them to hold their concert.

And they said yes.

Great!

And that includes you.

Thanks, Lacy.

But I hardly think I'd
be acceptable to all

Those big stars.

Well, you know, when
Rif Harper saw your work,

He loved what you did.

And he told the others about it.

And they all said yes.

They give their approval.

Where would I fit
into a show like this?

Right smack in the middle.

Ali, this is wonderful.

I can't think of a better
showcase for your talents.

All right!

Now, look.
You.

Get out of here.

Go home.

Do anything you want to do.

But please, please be on time.

Hey, I'm always on time.

Ali.

Don't turn around.

Look, just act normal, baby.

What's wrong?

Just start the car up, drive
off, and go to the beach.

But stay away from my place.

Come on.

Do it.

All right.

Nobody followed us.

What in the world is going on?

Just stay away from my place.

Thank God they don't
know where you live.

Are you trying to scare me?

No, I'm trying to educate you.

Listen to me.

Six months ago, I was a
kickboxer in New York.

What?

There's a guy who's
into organized crime.

He owns my contract.

He lost a lot of money on me.

Well, he's come to get it back.

But you don't have any money.

He wants me to fight again.

It's a special event.

It's a fight to the death.

Then lets go to the police.

No!

Now, you listen to me.

I want you to get up there
on that stage tomorrow

Night and knock 'em dead.

You're gonna shine
like a star, baby.

It's been your lifetime goal.

Come on.

It's not that important.

It is that important.

I've gotten away from
these guys before.

And I'll do it again.

Besides, I'm supposed to
be pursuing you, remember?

You sure have a
funny way of doing it.

I ain't gonna let you go.

You know I'm coming back, baby.

Who's here?

What do you want?




Legs.

Shh shh shh shh shh shh.

You outta your... you crazy?

Maybe.

What's going on.

Regetti's back.

Oh, shit.

He wants me for a
fight to the death.

Listen to me.

I need your help, man.

I need to disappear for a while.

OK?

So what about Ali?

She's playing this
big show at the club.

Buddy Ray Lester.

We'll give him a call.

He can put you up tonight.

And he'll take care of things.

So when's this fight
supposed take place?

Tomorrow night.

Oh, man.

You're nuts.

Don't tell me.

You want to go see her, right?

I've got to see her, man.

I mean, she's waited for
this all of her life.

This is her big chance.

I wish you could see her, Legs.

Hey, I'm... I'm
working on just trying

To get my ass off this floor...
Not out of the whole building.

Legs, if I don't
fight, they'll kill me.

What's worse is
they might hurt Ali.

I ain't had a fight
in six months, man.

I'm out of shape.

Either way, I'll lose.

Take your old lady and get
your ass out of town, man.

I don't need you
to babysit my ass.

Go.
Thanks, buddy.

Thanks.

Tell us.

I'll find out where he is, boss.

Eh... eh... eh, that's enough.

Leave her alone.

You going to tell
us where he is?

I told you, I don't
know where he is.

He's got to fight.

Why don't you just
leave him alone?

Well, I got a...
Some of my friends

Are gonna get together
tomorrow night.

They're expecting
to see a fight.

They bet an awful lot
of money on this fight.

And your Cage is the
feature attraction.

If he don't want to
fight, they're going

To lose an awful lot of money.

My friends are going
to be very unhappy.

I told you.

I don't know where he is.

You play the guitar,
don't you, honey?

Yeah.

Wouldn't it be awful if
you couldn't play anymore?

What do you mean?

Put her hand in the vice.

Maybe she can
remember where he is.

No!

No... [screams]

[Music playing]

TOMMY ROE (SINGING):
Don't let me down.

Well, Lacy.

How'd we sound?

You sound terrific!

What a sound.

Pedro.

Listen... have you seen Ali?

No, not tonight, bro.

I don't think she's come in yet.

No, she's got to be here, man.

Sh... she ain't never late.

Hey, why don't you
go and ask Lacy.

You know, Rif was telling
us about this place.

It's really fantastic.

Hey, Lacy, have you seen Ali?

No, she's probably
having her hair

Done or something like that.

I mean, she should
have been here by now.

Isn't her rehearsal next?

Maybe she had trouble
getting here, or... Cage.

What the hell's happening?

Nothing.

Hey, listen.

Is there anything we can do?

No, thanks.

Where is he?

She doesn't know.

She would have told us.

What do you want us to do.

Lock her up.

Watch both apartments.

When he realizes
she's not around,

He'll go to one or the other.

Shit.

The fight starts at 6 o'clock.

We don't want to be late.

Damn.

I'll pull the
trigger, if I have to.

Where's Ali, Lou.

We got her, Cage.

We roughed her up a bit.

I got her waiting for
you at the fights.

Great for coming out tonight.

out the window

At the raindrops pouring down.

Takes me to another
time and place.

I had more hair on my head
then, and less lines on my face.

And I didn't have this
spare tire round my waist.

I'm glad you came
to your senses.

Where is Ali?

She's my insurance.

Sort of a guarantee
that you'll fight.

saw your hair was brown.

Last night you was
a blonde, I swore.

But my head was so bad, I was
looking just to make a score.

She ain't Johnnie.

She ain't bad.

She ain't the best
thing I ever had.

Last night she kept
me from feeling sad.

She ain't Johnnie.

But she ain't bad.

Just in case you do something
stupid, she'll pay for it.

OK?

Let's get this over with.

lady from Oklahoma City

With a tattoo of butterfly.

She was hotter
than a firecracker

On the Fourth of July.

I kissed her on the lips,
then I kissed her shoulder.

Then I kissed her
on the butterfly.

I waited till she
closed her eyes

And then I kissed her goodbye.

She ain't Johnnie.

But she ain't bad.

She ain't the best
thing I ever had.

That night she kept
me from feeling sad.

She ain't Johnnie,
but she ain't bad.

So here I stand just like
a sneaking, peeping tom.

Peepin' over the back fence.

You've got to see what
Johnnie's [inaudible].

She's hanging clothes.

And though there's
curlers in her hair

There's still a trace
of my Johnnie there.

She ain't Johnnie.

But she ain't bad.

She's still the best
thing I ever had.

And coming back here
just makes me sad.

She ain't Johnnie.

But she ain't bad.

[Bell ringing]

Everybody having a good time?


Great.

Are you ready for
this main event?

Good!

I hope everyone's
having a good time,

Because we're about
ready to begin!

In this corner, wearing red,
the color of blood... Dr. Death!

[Crowd jeering]

And his opponent... his
opponent, you all know.

Coming from the depths of
the swamplands... the Cajun.

He came, tonight,
out of retirement,

Just for this fight.

Cage Damante!

[Crowd cheering]


No chains or jewels.

My house is small, but I can
never tell without the view.

My radio plays AM.

But that didn't
matter last night.

You were rocking out in my bed.

You been here before.

You'll be here again.

So what the hell, let's
make this a steady thing.

Let's live together.

Hey!

Maybe I was wrong.

Come on, will ya?

Back off.

Listen to me, dammit!

I don't want your money.

Your life for mine.

Please don't hit me anymore.

It's over, man!

It's over.

I'm getting out of here!

You all right, baby?

Hey, listen we
gotta get somebody

To take care of that hand.

Oh.

I gotta get to the club first.

Wait a minute.

You can't play like that, baby.

Then you can play for me.

I can still sing all right.

Uh uh.

No way.

Come on.

If you can fight in front
of all those people,

You can certainly play guitar
in front of an audience.

Please?

My hand'll be fine.

Are you sure?

Why not?

Hell, I might even
have a good time.

I love you, baby.

life's like a scene

In a B-movie where
the pretty boy

Breaks the poor girl's heart.

I can see you haven't
learned your lesson.

That's just another reason
why we are still apart.

I remember the fussing
and the fighting.

All the other other
men sent me on way.

But that doesn't mean
I don't still love you.

And every now and then I
still have to say don't you

Know you're riding for a fall?

Don't you know you're
riding... can't you

See you're riding for a fall?

How 'bout that,
ladies and gentlemen?

Hey, thank you.

How y'all doing tonight?

I, uh... had a little accident
on the way over here.

So I asked a good friend
of mine, Mr. Cage Damante,

To help me out here
and play for us.

By the way, he wrote
this here song.

And I hope y'all like it.
