Are they gone?

Stay down, Eric.

We have to go, now!

Eric, where's Eric?

Eric!

Move. Now! Son, do it!

Robert!

No!

You monster!

Extra! Extra!

Showoff.

Look at that! It's
richthofen, gotta be!

Hey, wait a minute! He
can't fly that low!

Coming through. Pardon me.

Look at this place. Excuse me.

Well, that was a long trip.

Good to see you, shah.

Today's the big day, captain.

Yeah.

Huh. Don't look so happy
about it. You deserve it.

We deserve it. Now
we'd better go.

The general's not the kind of
man you want to keep waiting.

There should be five thousand
troops here, not two.

The recalls of our troops and
equipment are bleeding us dry.

Those fools in Europe would rather
prepare to fight each other

than the martians.

We will be enough.

Do you really believe
that, Theodore?

I won't allow myself to
believe anything else.

I'm under pressure to come home. I
don't know how long I can stall.

Good morning, captain.

Lieutenant Carter.

Hey. When this is over,
maybe you and I could...

When hell freezes over.

Well, I think there's a
wee chill in the air.

You don't know what you're
missing, Jennifer my darlin'.

That's lieutenant Carter...
Corporal.

Yes, sir. I mean, ma'am.

Ladies and gentlemen. If I
may have your attention.

As you know, 15 years
ago, the martians

launched their unprovoked
attack against us.

Over 140 million of
us were murdered.

And many of our great
cities laid to waste.

Until the invaders were
beaten by the smallest

of earth's living creatures...
The germ.

From that destruction, we formed the allied
resistance earth squadrons, a.R.E.S.

From the best of our planet's armies. To
make sure that it never happened again.

Professor Tesla, a.R.E.S.
Chief of science

and the man responsible for unlocking
the secrets of martian technology

has made an alarming discovery.

Professor Tesla.

Good afternoon.

Mars' orbit is once again approaching
a time of close proximity to earth.

I have detected large scale fluctuations of
magnetic energy from the martian surface.

Along with a series of low
frequency radio signals.

It is my belief that the signals
are a martian military code

hidden within sunspot activity.

That they and the magnetic energy
coming from the planet's surface

serve as a prelude
to an invasion.

An invasion?

How soon?

Weeks... days... hours.

So you have no idea!

I do. They will come when they
are ready and we are not.

So we must get ready... now!

This is our new achilles
class battle tripod

65 feet tall... a heavy machine
gun and six light rockets

heat ray with an effective
range of a thousand meters.

And an 88 millimeter
Cannon on full turret.

Because of their outstanding performance
in recent battle simulations

the honor of command of the
first of these will go

to captain Eric
Wells and his crew.

Don't be shy, captain.

I give you Eric Wells from england,
lieutenant Jennifer Carter from the U.S.,

corporal Patrick o'brien from Ireland,
sergeant Abraham Douglas from Canada,

and lieutenant raja
iskandar shah from malaya.

Have you thought
of a name for her?

The goliath, sir.

Ah, an excellent choice.

Tomorrow you will all be
divided into two equal forces.

To further our preparations
for the coming conflict

we will stage a war game.

Blue team will be under the
command of captain Wells.

Your force will consist of French,
Italian and Indian tripods.

The red team of Korean,
German and Austrian tripods

will be under the command
of captain sakai.

My money's on sakai!
Twenty on Wells!

Nothing can prepare
you for war itself.

The sound... smell... fear...

Death is ugly.

All you can do is make sure
it is your enemy that dies.

So prepare yourselves.

Know what you fight for...
Who you fight for.

This time... we will be ready!

Come.

Good evening, sir.

Sarge, you don't have to address me as
'sir'... 'Cap' or even 'Eric' is fine.

Sorry, sir.

A bunch of us are going to the green
man to let off a little steam.

Thanks, but I have a few
things I need to check over.

I spoke to lieutenant Carter.
She asked if you were coming.

She did?

I guess one beer wouldn't hurt.

So... is it true your
father owns a rail road?

No. He owns two.

So tell us, darlin', what's a rich
bird like you doing in a.R.E.S.?

I don't think that's any of
your business, corporal.

Why don't you let the lieutenant tell
me what is and isn't my business.

Captain?

Hey, it's okay. My father
viewed me as his property.

To be what he wanted. To marry whom
he wanted. I saw it differently.

And I'm glad you did. Just the
sight of you brightens my day.

Atten-hut!

It's Roosevelt!

Please, at ease folks... sit...
Enjoy yourselves.

Tonight I'm not the
secretary of war.

I'm just an old soldier named Teddy
who could use a drink with friends.

May I join you?

Of course, sir. I'll
get us another round.

Thank you, captain,
but I'll pass.

Told Tessa and the girls
that I'd be home early.

My best to the family, Abe.

Thank you, sir.

This business in Europe is no good.
The Balkans are about to go to hell.

Countries mobilizing
against each other

unless we are united,
mankind is done for.

Humanity will rise
to the occasion.

You think so?

It is my hope, and my prayer. If
it is our destiny, only God knows.

Wisely said, sir.

Tell me, o'brien, does it bother
you to serve under an englishman?

I'm an ulsterman from the north.
My loyalties are to the crown.

Oh really? I heard your
brother was I.R.A.

My brother's his own man, Mr.
secretary. As am I.

I've not seen him
for three years.

Besides he's harmless. He'd walk over
ten naked women to get to a pint.

If you'll excuse me.

Of course.

Nice night.

Mind telling me what
kind of mood he's in.

Here you go, boyos.

With this, we can blow all
downing street to hell.

You shoot me, brother, and
there'll be hell to pay with ma.

If it ain't the
hero of a.R.E.S.

Get out the whiskey, Liam.

To me baby brother, who will help
us hijack enough heat rays tonight

to blast the bloody English out
of Ireland, once and for all.

Slainte mhaith!

Maybe we can even get our mitts on
one of them new battle tripods.

Okay, bucko. When and where?

Look, Sean, there's
been a complication.

Don't be playing with your
older brother now, paddy.

We've been called up for war
games. The whole base is on alert.

When then? Tomorrow?
The day after?

I... I'll let you know. Look...
I have to get back.

You're not going yellow
on us now, are ya, paddy?

Shut yer gob, o'Rourke.
My brother's no coward.

I just need time.

Europe's about to explode
and take england with it.

We either make our move when it
does, or we'll never be free.

I know that.

Know this too, boyo.
You took the oath.

You break it, brother or
no, I'll kill you dead.

To the crew of the goliath.
The best of the best.

I'd rather drink piss
than drink to them.

What did he say?

Excuse me. Did you
just say something?

He is drunk. Ignore him.

I said, I'd rather drink
piss than drink to them.

Simulations and
games mean nothing.

And don't think that farting match
with Spain and Cuba was a war

if Germany was involved we
would have ended it in a week.

Everyone knows that the Germans are
the best soldiers in the world.

And after we kick Europe's ass, we'll
come for you in America... Teddy.

I said, we'll come for you!

Well then, why don't we start...
Now!

Haha, now we're talking!

I say, how was that bit
of simulation, old boy?

Today, at 11am in Sarajevo...

Archduke Franz ferdinand
was assassinated.

What does this mean?
There will be war.

When you return to a.R.E.S., you
will find cables from your homelands

recalling you to service
in your national armies.

This cannot be. What
about the martians?

They will just have
fewer of us to kill.

What can we do?

It is our duty.

We must leave.

No.

What did you say?

I said... no!

We're not just French, or German
or Japanese we are a.R.E.S.

We are human.

I have seen what the
martians will do.

They will murder our brothers...
Our wives... our children...

And if you are lucky
enough to survive

you will spend the rest
of your miserable lives

running like hunted animals.

Always knowing that because of
your cowardice, in this moment

everything you loved was dead.

We will be traitors
to our homeland.

It is they who are the traitors.

Those pompous arrogant fools
who call you to their war.

They say they fight
for their honor

when it is only for their
greed and their vanity.

We must remain together...
We must fight as one.

I ask you... I beg you...
Who will fight with me?

Who will live and
die my brother?

I will... Deutschland
can kiss my ass.

As will I.

A.R.E.S.!

A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!
A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!

A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!
A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.! A.R.E.S.!

It had to be you.

Just checking on a few things.

For what? The tenth time?

Seventh, but who's counting?

It'll be fine.

I know...

No, you don't, but you should.

You were the best
captain in training.

Training is not reality.

When my parents were killed...

I froze.

You were 10 years old...

Right... um... if
you don't mind...

Sure.

Oh um... that guy tonight...

The one who spoke and kept all
of a.R.E.S. From running home.

That man... he wouldn't
freeze in battle.

Tripods are loaded and secure
general. All gangways retracted.

Open the canopy.

Release ties.

Seventy knots. North northeast.

Seventy knots. North northeast.

Steady as she goes.

Steady as she goes.

Captain sakai, your red forces will
mass 20 Miles north of ellenville.

Captain Wells, your blues will
be 20 Miles to the South.

Your goal is simple. Destroy
the force facing you.

All heat rays will be set on only
enough power to mark your enemy.

This won't be war, but it
is as close as we can get.

Looks like there's a river
about 12 Miles east.

We'll spread the team
a mile wide and wait.

When they hit the middle of
the river, we'll open up.

I know captain sakai.
The man is a samurai.

He will attack full force
in the center of our line.

Scouts one through five... I want
you a thousand yards to point.

Scouts six and seven, right.
Eight through ten, left.

No one gets on our flanks
without us knowing.

If you see the enemy, you are
to report back. Do not engage.

I repeat. Do not engage.

I want them coming to us.
Not digging in.

The storm is distorting all
communications between the leviathan

and the blue and red teams.

I don't like it. Get
me Professor Tesla.

Sorry, sir. The storm.

I don't like it at all.

Alright, men. We wait.

If shah is right, sakai should
be arriving in 20 minutes.

There's something
wrong here, captain.

Sakai must have forgotten
to lower his power levels.

That wasn't sakai.

Martians!

Hendrix... hendrix!

Hendrix is dead!

What the hell's
going on out there?

Sir... captain... your orders!

Incoming!

Captain Wells!

Eric, move!

Get a message to the leviathan
that we are under attack.

Blue team, this is not a drill.
Full power to heat rays.

Replace paint with live
armaments and fire at will.

Ready when you are, Eric.

Let's blow these
monsters to hell.

Desalvo! Get out!

Come on, boys, pour it on!

Engaging!

Keep firing!

Yes, sir.

I got him, I got him!

De wolf! Hold the line!

Jennifer! On your right!

Jennifer, fire up that heat ray!
Now!

Twenty degrees right. Distance five
hundred yards. Elevation ninety feet.

Damn you, die!

Good shooting, lieutenant.
Maintain fire!

Yes, sir.

My God!

Duncan is down!

Where's sakai?

Captain. It's red team!

Red team, fire at will.

Let's finish this.

Yes, sir.

Ready when you are, Eric.

Ready when you are.

They're entering our atmosphere.
The invasion has begun captain.

Congratulations on
your victory, captain.

We have 57 dead 17 injured.

We lost six scouts, four
spartans, six achilles.

You'll excuse me, sir, if I
don't think of it as a victory.

Was the enemy destroyed?

Yes, sir.

Then it was a victory, captain.

The aliens are bigger, stronger
and faster than they were.

It's not supposed to be easy.

Why didn't they land in force?

It was a probe to test
our capabilities.

Now they know what
they are fighting.

Sir, we've just gotten word of
landings throughout Europe and Asia,

but the martians seem to be
concentrating their forces

in north America.

Where?

Montreal, new Orleans. The
largest is in new Mexico.

Our bases in Europe and
Asia will respond.

Take us back to a.R.E.S. I
want a full mobilization.

All leaves are cancelled. All troops
are to report to their units.

Strike forces will be armed,
outfitted and ready to leave

in three hours.

Gentlemen, I believe their little
European war has just been cancelled.

Are we ready, sir?

We better be.

Me thinks your brother
has turned, Sean.

He'll be here.
What'd I tell you?

Where are they?

The martians are back.

I didn't ask you about the martians,
brother. I asked about the heat rays.

We're at war, Sean.

Yeah. With the English.

I have no weapons for you.

You're some kinda piss, paddy!

Don't you get it, bucko?

We'd all rather be dead at
the hands of the martians

than live under English tyranny.
You've betrayed us.

I betrayed nobody. Sean, this
is bigger than just Ireland.

Goodbye, Sean. Tell
ma I loved her.

Go, on, shoot the
bloody traitor!

Damn, if you're going to
be a woman about it...

Put him in the truck. Patrick!
You're dead to me.

Get those stormcrows in the air now!
I want 24 hour air cover! Let's go!

I want the battlecruisers repulse and
Bismarck to support new Orleans.

I want the atlas rolling at flank
speed to Montreal with the agamemnon.

The minotaur will follow us.

Anything we can do?

We'll be in new
Mexico at dawn.

Until then, you can
rest and you can pray.

I never thought this
day would come.

I thought the bacteria
would keep us safe.

Well, looks like the ugly
buggers developed an immunity.

Godspeed men, and give 'em hell.

Are we fit for battle?

Would I be coming down
now if we weren't, sir?

No, of course you wouldn't.
Please accept my apology.

Why don't you hate the British?

From what I hear, your people
were living in palaces

when the brits were in caves.

Now you're a colony.
They own your asses

and treat you like
you were savages.

As Shakespeare said, 'there is
no darkness but ignorance.'

Shakespeare... where'd
you learn that?

Oxford.

How did a 'wog', no
offense, get to Oxford?

I used to be a prince. My family
disowned me for joining a.R.E.S.

I know how that feels.
My brother...

Wanted you to steal weapons for the
fenians to use against the British.

You knew?

I saw you leave the bar the other
night and guessed the rest.

You didn't report me?

No. I trusted you.

Then I checked the inventory to
see if any weapons were missing.

You did the right
thing, Patrick.

Coffee?

Thanks. What are
you smiling about?

Tomorrow.

You actually look
forward to battle?

A four hundred knot dive out of the
sun... guns blazing at the enemy...

For me it is better
than schnapps!

I think you're a
little crazy, manfred.

I think I have to be.

I wish I were more
like you, my friend.

We are not so different. Except I
carry only my own life in my plane.

You... you carry the
lives of your crew.

Get some sleep. Tomorrow
we find our destiny, ya?

General, we have contact.

Nine martian aircraft bearing
sixty degrees north by northwest.

Hundred and twenty five
Miles out and closing.

Battle stations.
Launch all fighters.

Stormcrows, head 26Â°
north northwest.

We must protect the leviathan.
Nothing gets through us.

Remember, your heat rays will need a
three minute recharge after firing, so

rely on your rockets
and machine guns.

Good hunting.

Valkyries, on me!

Stormcrows! Maintain formation.

Here they come!

Break! Break!

Where is he? I can't see him!

Got him!

Bank hard left.

There are too many!

Where the hell is richthofen?

I'm hit! I'm hit!

They are heading
for the leviathan.

Targeting. Bearing 33Â°.

Richthofen!

Leaving the dance early, ya?
It's just you and me, fraulein.

Come on, come on... charge!

Report.

We lost three valkyries
and seven stormcrows.

Seven martian craft
are confirmed down.

The last two broke off
their attack and ran home.

They are faster than we are.
But we turn quicker.

Sir, just gotten word of 15 tripods
supported by a dozen martian wings

driving towards Albuquerque.

Move to intercept. I want
scouts dropped down behind them

to monitor their approach.

You can grieve for your dead
later. We'll need you in the air.

Gentlemen, we will place our
heaviest tripods in a line...

Below that low Ridge.

The rest will deploy with all
ground troops and the militia here

on both sides of the canyon.

The leviathan will take up
stations in the clouds above us.

With any luck, we will catch
the invaders in a killing box.

Someone put that fire out!

Get him out of there!

General... there weren't
fifteen. There were only twelve.

Those three tripods are
somewhere. If they outflank us...

Take the beowulf and
three scouts. Find them.

Yes, sir.

And get this man to a doctor.

Let's look sharp.
They must be close.

I think dividing our
forces was a dumb idea.

I don't remember anybody caring
what you thought, o'brien.

Those creatures
could be anywhere.

Sir, it's a trap!

Scouts! Pull back!

Goliath! Beowulf! Fire at will!

Locked on target.

Abe, let them have it!

Yes, sir!

Take evasive action, beowulf!

No!

Fire all weapons. Give
them everything we've got.

Where are the others?

These creatures always
move in threes.

We're losing hydraulics!

Brace for impact!

I need that heat ray!

Weapon systems report!

The heat Ray's gone to hell.

We're blind.

I've got no power here, captain.

Abe! Status report.

I've got no movement
and no shot.

Maybe we'll get lucky...

That thing is on the move.
Abe, can you sight on him?

I've got a shot.

Take it!

You got him!

All dead, captain.

They were good men.

It's just a scratch. I'm okay.

We've got to move out.

We should bury the
beowulf's crew.

There is no time.

If we stay with the goliath, we'll
have a better chance of being found.

Our mission is to find
those remaining tripods.

That is what I intend to do.

On foot? No thanks. I didn't join
a.R.E.S. To be in the bloody infantry.

You either follow orders...

Or what? You're
going to shoot me?

Yes.

I think it's dead.

Yeah. I just like
to see 'em bleed!

If there are anymore
around, they'll hear you.

Thank you. Your
squad saved us.

Ain't no more squad...
Except me.

Hope your sorry <i>asses</i>
 were worth it.

Where are you going?

To kill me some more tripods.

You know where they are?

Hell, I know where
them bastards live.

After they burnt out espanola
and blowed up my wife...

I joined that militia...

They thought they got my Lucy,
oh no no no, I fooled 'em good.

Er... how'd you do that?

Huh...? I found a piece of her.
See?

You see what's leading us... the
man's out of his bleeding mind.

He's keeping his dead wife's
finger around his neck.

You ever in love, o'brien?

Dozens of times.

Anyone ever tell you,
you don't know shit?

What'd I say?

Abe wasn't talking about lust.
He was talking about love.

What's the difference?

It's the other tripod. Looks like it's
guarding some sort of power plant.

You thinking of storming
the castle, captain...

With one heat ray
and a pea shooter?

They're here for a reason.
We need to get inside.

Are you nuts... sir?

How the hell are we
going to do that?

My guess is you're gonna
be needing a distraction.

We'll find another way.

Lucy and me both know
there is no other way.

What's that?

Lucy says it was good meeting you.
Even if you are a damn limey.

Now what?

We wait... for his signal.

The emergency transponder.

The martians seem to
know when we're coming.

I'm changing the frequency. Hopefully
they won't be monitoring them.

And hopefully the
leviathan will.

Okay you slimy
sons-of-bitches, here I come!

Let's go.

That's one crazy cowboy.

I'm comin' home, honey.
I'm comin' home.

Strange place...

Tell me about it.

Shah. You, Jennifer and
Abe follow that thing

see if you can
help that woman.

You have the satchel charge?

That I do.

Take care of yourself.

You too.

You two have something going?

It's none of your business.

Just trying to
make conversation.

Monsters.

Let's get them out
of the cages first.

You pitch. I'll catch.

What the hell is that?

No idea but it can't be good.

Just great. We built our power
plants based on their technologies

now they move right in and
make anything they want.

One satchel charge in this
place is not gonna mean much.

It will if it blows in
their control room.

Hurry.

Those things smell like a pub
toilet on a Sunday morning.

They probably say the
same about us. C'mon.

We're here.

Cap... I just... I mean...
I know I...

I'm sorry about
being such an ass.

You're an irishman... you
can't help yourself.

Just kidding.

I didn't know the English
had a sense of humor.

By the way... I think the
Irish should have self-rule.

Why didn't you ever tell me?

You never asked.

If I can get close enough, I
can lob the satchel inside.

It's too open. You'll be seen.

It's oil... and
that's propane.

Set the charge here with
a five minute fuse.

Done... five it is.

Let's go find the others.

I can't.

Don't look down.
Just watch my eyes.

Honey, I haven't
dropped anybody yet.

I'll count to three.
One, two...

Abe! Behind you!

Hey! Tall, dark and ugly.

Jennifer!

It's not charged.

I'll be right back.

Are you okay?

Come on, honey, I got you.
You can jump now. C'mon.

Hold tight, darlin'.

Get out of here! The whole
place is gonna blow.

Come on now. Up here.

Go!

Get them out... now.

I'll cover you.

That's an order.

Come and get it.

Hot damn, kid, you did it!

Kid?

I mean you did it... sir.

Oh now we're well
and truly cooked.

It's an honor to
die with you, sir.

Set a course for New York.
Maximum speed.

Yes, sir.

Sir, you wanted to see me.

Your team performed remarkably
well against incredible odds.

I congratulate you. There will
be the appropriate medals.

Thank you, sir. I heard the
battle for Albuquerque went well.

We lost 40 percent of our men,
30 percent of our aircraft,

and half of our tripods.

Whenever someone asks me if I
believe in heaven and hell...

I tell them, I don't know about
heaven, but on hell I'm an expert.

How's your crew?

Bruised and battered.

A few days r&r and they and
the goliath will be fine.

I wish I could give it to you.

But... we won, sir.

Montreal, new Orleans, new
Mexico were distractions.

Feints to lure the majority of
our forces out of New York.

They've surrounded Manhattan.
We've won nothing.

Prepare your crew, captain. We
will meet our enemy in 15 hours.

Dismissed.

When I get back to New York,
I'm going to drink five beers

and make love with three women.

No make that... ah... three
beers and five women.

Me? I just want
to hold my girls.

How go the repairs?

Fine. A few days and the goliath
will be as good as new.

You've got 15 hours.
They hit New York.

Sir?

I'm sorry.

My girls...

Got a minute, captain?

Sure.

You saved us all today.

I was just putting one foot
in front of the other.

I got lucky.

Luck had nothing
to do with it.

You must be worried
about your family.

I am. Um. My father and I,
we're not very close but...

I'm sure he would have been
very proud of you today.

Thanks.

Look... I've been thinking...

This is not easy.

Sometimes it's just
best to say it.

Okay... here goes.

All this... it makes me
realize what's important.

It separates the things
you really want,

from the things you
only think you want.

And?

I really want you.

What?

You heard me.

You hear something?

Nope. Not a thing.

When will the cavalry
arrive, colonel?

Unknown, sir. The martians are
jamming up all radio frequencies.

All cable and telegraph
lines have been cut.

We're in the dark, Mr.
secretary.

The aliens have landed
cylinders near major cities.

The invaders staged multiple
landings around Manhattan

and central park itself.

We've lost all contact with
a.R.E.S. And militia forces.

In the Washington
square area, sir.

That's it then, general. Pull back
all remaining ground forces to base.

Understood, Mr. secretary. Lieutenant,
order all troops to return to base.

It looks like we're what
they wanted all along.

The landings up north and out west
were feints to drain our strength.

Kill the head and the body dies.

Seal up the base. Prepare
for the assault.

We've been breached, sir.

There's a speedboat waiting
to take you to safety.

If you hurry, you can make it.

No of fence, colonel. But I'm
in no mood for a boat ride.

I understand, sir.
Your orders?

Die well.

Good shooting, sir.

Did you think I was
just a pretty face?

Talbert! Damn.

Bully! Bully!

Okay, boys. The
cavalry have arrived.

Now, let's send those alien
monsters back to hell.

All units. Fire at will.

We've retaken the base, general.
They're retreating uptown.

Excellent, Mr. secretary.

Drive them towards us, and we'll
crush them in the middle.

Steady... steady...
Wait for it...

Now!

Yeah!

Blow 'em to hell!

C'mon, ya tossers! You're
meeting an irishman.

One of me's worth ten of you.

C'mon, me beauty! Yah! Yah!

Got him.

Fire!

Captain Wells.

Mr. secretary.

My God, we did it, captain. Ha!
We beat the bloody monsters.

We took back the city!

Victory! Victory! Victory!

General, I'm picking up a
large magnetic signature...

Seven Miles South by southeast
of our current position.

Sir, there's something
emerging from the bay.

Wha... what is that?

What in heaven's name?

It isn't over.

All hands to battle stations.

A.R.E.S. Base is under
attack by an enemy air ship.

Inform the captain of the agamemnon and
take us up to three thousand feet.

Full power to all engines.
Deploy primary weapon.

We are going to stop them.

If you want to draw the
beast's attention...

You must first bloody it's nose.

Fire!

Hit them again.

Again!

My God... the agamemnon.

Take us down. Four hundred feet.
Now.

Lieutenant richthofen, your weapons
will be useless against their armor.

Get your fighters out of here.

We must get close
to the enemy.

Helmsman, maintain speed.
Steady as she goes.

Courage, lieutenant.

Brace for impact!

Hold on, lieutenant.

General, you've got to take the
helm. The ship's going to break up!

You must save the ship.

No... do not let go!

I love you, father.

Dmitri...

Take us up. Three
hundred feet.

All guns. Fire!

The leviathan is down.
They died for us.

Jasamu akan dikenang.

My friends, today we have won
the battle, but not the war.

Many of our brothers and
sisters around the globe,

and we, in our humanity, are
all brothers and sisters,

are fighting and dying
at this moment.

But, I swear to you in the
names of our hallowed dead...

That we will never
forget our mission.

We will drive these monsters from
our earth... from our home...

And one day, take
the war to them.

Mars! Do you hear us?

Mankind is coming, and a.R.E.S.
Will lead the way.
