[ Teenage Girl Narrating ]
GOD, ISN'T HE ADORABLE?

HE'S MY BOYFRIEND,
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE
MARRIED AND HAVE KIDS...

AND GO TO COLLEGE TOGETHER
SOMEDAY.

IF YOU OVERLOOK THE STORY OF
OUR EXCRUCIATING SENIOR YEAR,

HE'S THE ULTIMATE
FUTURE HUSBAND.

HI, I'M ADAM FISHER.
I'M A SENIOR OVER
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.

GO HOGS!

I KNOW THIS IS A BIT EARLY
TO ASK YOU THIS,

SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE MET AND ALL,

BUT IT'S REAL IMPORTANT TO ME
TO BE THE KIND OF GUY
THAT GOD WANTS ME TO BE.

YOU SEE, THE ONE THING
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH...

IS IF DOING IT IS SO BAD,

WHY DID GOD MAKE IT
FEEL SO GOOD?

[ Girls Giggling ]

HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

UM, LADIES,

MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP BY
THE NEW MEMBERS' RECEPTION...

AT REVEREND LEMKO'S OFFICE.

HE KIND OF REFERRED ME TO YOU,
SINCE, LIKE, YOU'RE
THE YOUTH PASTOR AND ALL.

LADIES, PLEASE.

WHERE YOU GIRLS GOING?

MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
THE CHURCH DOWN THE STREET.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT, 8:00.

CHURCH AT NIGHT? COOL.

HEY, COULD I BRING A DATE?

[ Girl Narrating ]
OKAY, SO ADAM WAS
AT AN IMPASSE ABOUT SEX,

BUT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD.

COULD I BRING TWO DATES?

[ Girl ]
ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE
HAVING A LOT OF SEX.

APPARENTLY,
THAT'S WHAT HIGH SCHOOL
WAS INVENTED FOR.

BUT EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT SEX ISN'T ANY FUN
WHEN YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.

YOU NEED
A LIFELONG COMMITMENT
SO THAT THERE'S REAL INTIMACY.

THAT'S WHAT MY FATHER SAYS.

YOU SEE, I'M SMART.
I'M WAITING UNTIL WE'RE MARRIED
TO GIVE MYSELF TO ADAM.

AND DESPITE
THE LARGE AMOUNT OF SEX
THAT OCCURS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

I KNEW I WAS MAKING
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE HAVING ANY FUN AT ALL.

[ Moaning ]

[ Squeaking ]

[ Girl ]
OKAY! ENOUGH!

ADAM UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY
HOW I FELT ABOUT THIS.

HE LOVED THAT I WAS
PURE AND VIRGINAL.

MY STOCK VALUE WAS VERY,
VERY HIGH AT OUR SCHOOL.

WE WERE
THE MOST POPULAR SENIORS.

AND ALSO VERY IN LOVE.

AND YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
WE DO LOOK GOOD TOGETHER.

YEAH, THAT'S ME, AMBER.

THE FUTURE MRS. ADAM.

WE WERE THE BEST LOOKING,
BEST DRESSED, MOST POPULAR
STUDENTS IN SCHOOL.

WE'D BEEN GOING STEADY
SINCE THE TENTH GRADE,

AND EXCEPT FOR
ADAM'S OCCASIONAL FLIRTING,
WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS.

I'M NOT TRYING TO BRAG,
BUT EVERYBODY LOVED US.

LIFE WAS PERFECT.

THEN ONE DARK FALL AFTERNOON
AT THE LOCAL LITTLE CHICKEN,

MY POOR BOYFRIEND WAS
TRICKED INTO RUINING IT ALL.

I KNEW HE COULDN'T HELP IT.

HE WAS A VICTIM, REALLY.

SHE LIVED IN A TRAILER.
SHE KNEW HOW TO CONFUSE
HIS YOUNG MIND.

I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

[ Pop ]
I'D ALMOST DO HER.

MOST GIRLS WOULD
DUMP THEIR BOYFRIENDS
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

BUT I KNEW THAT HE WAS WEAK
AND JUST COULDN'T HELP IT.

[ MOANING ]

OH, BABY! OH, YES! OHH!

[ Gasping And Moaning ]

YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!

CHOCOLATE SUNDAE,
EXTRA CREAM.

WELL?
DID YOU DO HER, BRO?

YOU KNOW I DON'T
HUMP AND TELL.

OH, MY GOD, YOU DID HER.

DON'T TELL ANYBODY, OKAY?

AMBER WOULD BE PISSED OFF
IF SHE FOUND OUT.

DUDE, WE WON'T TELL A SOUL.

WE WON'T SAY A THING.
NOT A WORD.

DUDE, HE DID HER
IN THE BATHROOM AT THE DINER.

I MEAN, SHE WAS LIKE--

TOTALLY HOT.

I THINK SHE'S A SOPHOMORE.

COME ON, DUDE, PUSH!
THIS IS GONNA BE
HIS GREATEST BIRTHDAY EVER.

WE'RE GONNA GET SO RIPPED!
[ Laughing ]

DID YOU HERE ABOUT ADAM
AND THAT SOPHOMORE SLUT?

OH, I KNOW.

I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S DOING THIS TO AMBER.

DOES AMBER HAVE A CLUE
WHAT'S GOING ON?

I DON'T THINK SO.
POOR AMBER.

POOR AMBER.

POOR AMBER.

POOR...
POOR...

HELLO!
AMBER!

UH, SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

[ Cheering ]

FOR ME?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

HEY, BIG GUY!
YOU'RE EIGHTEEN!

OH, THANKS, MAN.
YOU'RE THE BEST!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BRO!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAN!

SURPRISE!

HI!

[ Amber Narrating ]
BUT AS CUTE AS HE IS,

I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL
MY OWN SEXUAL IMPULSES.

NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIED,

I HELD MY GROUND.

ADAM AND GINGER CONTINUED
TO SEE EACH OTHER
BEHIND MY BACK.

SO, AMBER, ARE YOU
GONNA GIVE ADAM...

SOMETHING EXTRA SPECIAL
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY?

WELL, I'M DEFINITELY
GOING TO TEASE HIM
A LITTLE BIT.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"TEASE HIM"?

UM, IT'S WHAT
I ALWAYS DO.

IT'S CALLED "EXERCISING
MY WOMANLY WAYS."

[ Amber Narrating ] I FELT SAFE
KNOWING THAT ADAM LOVED ME
AND WOULD ALWAYS BE MINE,

UNAWARE THAT GINGER
WAS SUCKING HIM
INTO A LUSTFUL ABYSS.

AS AGONIZING
AS IT WAS FOR ADAM,
IT COULDN'T LAST.

BESIDES, GINGER ALREADY HAD
A STEADY BOYFRIEND,

AND HE WAS
SCHEDULED FOR PAROLE
IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS.

?? I GOT A BOYFRIEND ??

?? HE'S A BAD BOY ??

?? HE'S MY FAVORITE ??

?? HE'S MY JOY ??

?? I GOT A BOYFRIEND ??

?? DANGER BOY ??

[ Amber Narrating ]
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M SHOWING YOU
THIS SCENE RIGHT NOW,

BUT I BET IF YOUR A BOY,
YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION NOW.

REALLY CLOSE ATTENTION.

"AND I CAN'T WAIT
 TILL WE'RE TOGETHER
 AT LAST, ONCE MORE.

"BEING APART IS SO PAINFUL.

P.S. I REALLY MISS
YOUR HUGE TOOL."

[ Laughing ]
ISN'T SHE THE SWEETEST THING?

DEFINITELY A KEEPER.
OH!

[ Amber ] OH, BUT
GINGER AND ADAM WOULD SOON
PAY THE PRICE FOR THEIR SINS.

[ Train Whistle Blaring ]

C'MON, C'MON, C'MON!

THIRTY MORE SECONDS.
[ Woman ]
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

OH, NOTHING, MOM.

WELL, THEN GET YOUR LAZY ASSES
OUT TO THE FREAKIN' STORE
AND PICK ME UP CIGARETTES.

SURE, OKAY.

JUST DO IT NOW!

C'MON!
[ Mother ]
MENTHOL!

IT'S BLUE!

BLUE MEANS I'M PREGNANT,
YOU DUMB ASS!

IT'S BLUE.

DAMN!
[ Kicks Wall ]

OOPS!

LOOK, MAYBE IT WAS
SOMETHING YOU ATE.
YOU THINK?

YEAH, LIKE BAD CORN
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

NO, BECAUSE I DIDN'T
EAT ANYTHING TODAY.
WHAT'RE WE GOING TO DO?

CAN'T WE GET RID OF IT?

SURE, IF WE HAD
400 BUCKS.

400? THERE MUST BE
SOME KIND OF HOME KIT.

NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

C'MON.
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

[ Croaking ]

MMM. KIND OF TANGY.

YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LIKE IT.

WELL, IAMPREGNANT.

DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL?

I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING DROPPING.

I DON'T THINK SO.
AW, DAMN!

MAYBE IF YOU PUNCHED ME
IN THE STOMACH OR THREW ME
DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

WELL, MY MOM WOULD GET MAD
IF YOU MARKED UP THE WALLS
AND STUFF.

C'MON, LET'S KEEP TRYING.

[ Crashing, Splashing ]

[ Amber ]
WHEN ALL THEIR OPTIONS RAN OUT,

ADAM DECIDED TO DO
THE RIGHT THING AND TELL
HIS UNDERSTANDING PARENTS.

SO, GINGER, IT'S ALWAYS NICE
TO MEET A NEW FRIEND
OF ADAM'S.

ACTUALLY,
WE'RE MORE THAN
JUST FRIENDS.

ADAM, AREN'T YOU AND AMBER
STILL GOING STEADY?

OH, YEAH, SURE,
BUT GINGER AND I
AREN'T GOING OUT.

WE'RE JUST DOING IT.

YOU DO REALIZE THIS ISN'T
VERY CHRIST-LIKE BEHAVIOR.

JESUS WOULD DEFINITELY
NOT APPROVE.

HONEY, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE HARD ON YOU,

BUT JESUS WAS AGAINST
SEX FOR PLEASURE.

EXCEPT IN THE MOVIE
I SAW ON CABLE
WITH DAVID BOWIE,

WHERE JESUS SLEPT
WITH THIS CHICK.

LUCKY BASTARD.

I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR MOTHER
LETS YOU WATCH SUCH FILTH.

ACTUALLY, MY MOM DOESN'T
REALLY CARE WHAT I DO,

ALTHOUGH MY BEING KNOCKED-UP
MIGHT GET A RISE OUT OF HER.

WHAT?

OH, I'M PREGNANT. YOU KNOW,
LIKE MARY WAS WITH JESUS,

EXCEPT I KNOW
WHO THE FATHER IS.

DEAR LORD!

JEEZ, HONEY,
ARE YOU OKAY?
MOM?

YES. I JUST NEED
A LITTLE AIR.

LOOK, MOM, DAD,

I KNOW THIS MIGHT NOT
BE THE BEST TIMING,
BUT CAN I HAVE $400?

FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS?
WHAT IN THE WORLD FOR?

WELL, GINGER AND I,
WE WANTED TO TAKE CARE
OF THE BABY.

HONEY, I DON'T MEAN
TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,

BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A LOT MORE THAN $400
TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY.

WELL, HOW MUCH IS IT
GOING TO COST THEN?

THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
TO CONSIDER:

FOOD, CLOTHING, DIAPERS.

WE WERE THINKING
IT WOULD BE CHEAPER
IF WE DIDN'T--

OH, GINGER, DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT THE COST.

ADAM'S FATHER AND I WILL
DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP.

A BABY IS A GIFT FROM GOD.

A BUNDLE OF PURE JOY.

EVEN IF IT IS A BASTARD.

AND I'M SURE YOUR PARENTS
WILL FEEL THE SAME WAY,
WON'T THEY, HONEY?

[ Man And Woman Arguing ]

MAYBE YOUR MOTHER
WILL BE HAPPY
TO HEAR THE NEWS.

YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU DON'T KNOW MY MOM.

SHE'S A COMPLETE PSYCHO.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR STEPDAD?

HE'S QUEER.

NO WAY!

WAY.

HE LIVES IN QUEENS
WITH HIS BOYFRIEND.

WOW!

THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CITY
AND EVERYTHING?

SHE'S GONNA BE SO PISSED.

LOOK, YOU SAW HOW WELL
MY PARENTS TOOK IT.
I MEAN--

MAYBE YOUR MOTHER
WILL TAKE IT BETTER
THAN YOU THINK.

YOU'RE WHAT?

I'M PREGNANT.

WELL,
YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING,

LEG SPREADING,
OVER-OVULATING
LITTLE SLUT!

I HATE YOU.

WHORE!

BITCH!

I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

LET'S GO!

HELL-BOUND HUSSY!

I'M GONNA GUT YOU LIKE A FISH,

AND WEAVE YOUR INTESTINES
INTO MACRAME!

SHE'S CRAZY.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE THE MAN.
AREN'T YOU GONNA DO
SOMETHING BRAVE?

YEAH, YEAH!

[ Mother ]
I'M GONNA GET YOU, YOU WHORE.

YOU--

YOU MOLESTING SON OF A--

GET AWAY FROM--

GET OF MY HOUSE,
YOU LITTLE LUSTY SCUMBAG!

YOU WHORE!

YOU LITTLE HELL-BOUND HUSSY!

[ Screaming ]

LET ME GO!
GET AWAY FROM ME!

SHE'S MY FRIGGIN' DAUGHTER!
I CAN KILL HER IF I WANT TO!

I MADE HER!

YOU! YOU IMPREGNATING MOLESTER.

YOU OUGHT TO BE
ARRESTING HIM.

HE KNOCKED UP MY BABY!

IT'S A GOOD THING
YOUR NEIGHBOR HEARD YOU
AND CALLED US.

OH, GOD.
THIS TIME WAS THE WORST.
I REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE GONERS.

IT MUST HAVE BEEN
PRETTY SCARY
FOR YOU KIDS, HUH?

YEAH, IT WAS A GOOD THING
I WAS THERE TO PROTECT HER.
RIGHT.

ARE WE FREE TO GO NOW,
OFFICER?

ACTUALLY, WE NEED THIS
LITTLE LADY TO COME DOWN,
SPEAK TO SOCIAL SERVICES.

DO I HAVE TO?

WE NEED TO GET YOU
CHECKED OUT, MISS,
FOR THE BABY AND ALL.

SO HOW FAR ALONG
ARE YOU?

HUH?

YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHEN THE BABY
WAS CONCEIVED?

WHEN DID YOU
KNOCK HER UP?

OH. WELL,
I'M NOT SURE, REALLY.

MAYBE IT WAS
THAT FIRST TIME WE DID IT
BACK AT THE LITTLE CHICKEN.

OR AT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY?

YEAH. THE BIG ONE-EIGHT.
NOW I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO GET DRUNK IN CANADA.

SO YOU THINK
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
TWO OCCASIONS, HUH?

MAYBE IT WAS THAT TIME
WHEN WE DID IT
IN THE MALL.

OR WHEN ROCKY LET US USE
HIS PARENTS' HOT TUB.

OR THAT TIME WHEN WE
WERE IN THE BACK ROW
OF THE MOVIE THEATER.

[ Mother Shouting ]
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

WE'D BETTER GET GOING.

WAIT. WILL YOU
COME DOWN WITH ME, PLEASE?

I'LL-- YOU
IN THE COP CAR.

I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

[ Mother ]
GET HIM IN HERE!
I WANT TO KILL HIM!

[ Amber ]
GINGER'S MOTHER CONTINUED
TO BE UNREASONABLE...

SO ADAM WAS QUICK
TO LEND A HELPING HAND.

HERE WE ARE.

IT'S NO PROBLEM, HONEY.
YOU STAY WITH US UNTIL
THINGS CALM DOWN AT HOME.

JUST TRY NOT
TO STEAL ANYTHING.

THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU,
MRS. FISHER.

WELL, AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE CARRYING OUR FIRST
ILLEGITIMATE GRANDCHILD.

THAT MAKES YOU
ONE OF THE FAMILY NOW.

[ Amber ]
HEARTWARMING, ISN'T IT?

A TOTAL MOMENT
FOR THE FAMILY ALBUM.

[ School Bell Ringing ]

[ Amber ] ADAM WOULD SOON
SUFFER THE FULL CONSEQUENCES
OF HIS ACTIONS.

BUT FOR NOW, HE REMAINED
BLISSFULLY IGNORANT,

AS YOU CAN SEE BY
THIS DREAM SEQUENCE.

???? [ Pop ]

[ Amber ]
BABY, HIT HER ONE MORE TIME.
PLEASE.

[ Woman On P.A. ]
ADAM FISHER?

ADAM FISHER?

ADAM FISHER, PLEASE COME
TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

ADAM FISHER.

WHAT'D YOU DO
THIS TIME, ADAM?

[ Amber ] JUST WHEN THE FISHERS
THOUGHT THAT THE ONLY THING
THEY HAD TO WORRY ABOUT...

WAS SOME MISSING FLATWARE,
WHOO! ADAM'S IN TROUBLE.

THINGS TOOK A DISASTROUS TURN.

GREAT. HERE WE GO AGAIN.

[ Girl ]
HEY, AMBER.
WHAT?

HEY, WHAT'S IT GOING
TO BE THIS TIME?

MAYBE A TONSIL INSPECTION
IN THE NURSE'S OFFICE?
NOT THIS TIME, ADAM.

THIS TIME, THE PRINCIPAL
ACTUALLY DOES NEED
TO SEE YOU IN HIS OFFICE.

WHY? WHAT'S UP?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU TELL ME.

SOME GUYS WENT IN THERE,
AND THEN HE BUZZED ME AND
ASKED ME TO CALL YOU DOWN.

ADAM FISHER?
YEAH?

MR. FISHER,
I'M DETECTIVE GRANGER FROM
THE GATLIN POLICE DEPARTMENT.

WE NEED YOU TO COME DOWN
TO THE STATION WITH US.
WHY?

I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO ARREST YOU ON
SUSPICION OF STATUTORY RAPE.

DO YOU THINK I DID IT
WITH A STATUE?

MR. FISHER, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT,
I'M INNOCENT.

ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND
WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD AN ATTORNEY,
ONE WILL BE PROVIDED FOR YOU.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND
YOUR RIGHTS?

HEY, BRO,
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE.

THEY'RE TAKING ME
TO THE BIG HOUSE.
YEAH? WHAT DID YOU DO?

IT'S GOT SOMETHING
TO DO WITH STATUES.

STATUTORY RAPE.
UNDERAGE SEX IS
A VERY SERIOUS CRIME.

LOOK, DO ME A FAVOR
AND DON'T TELL AMBER
ABOUT THE COPS AND ALL.

HE'S SO BUSTED.

YOU CAN GO TO JAIL
FOR BANGING A SOPHOMORE?

[ Mrs. Fisher ]
HI. YOU'VE REACHED THE FISHERS'.
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE.

[ Woman ]
THIS IS THE OPERATOR
WITH A COLLECT CALL...

FROM THE GATLIN COUNTY JAIL
FROM ADAM.

WILL YOU ACCEPT THE CHARGES?

ALL RIGHT, FISHER,
THE LIEUTENANT
WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

YOU CAN USE THAT PHONE
TO CALL YOUR PARENTS WHILE
I FINISH WITH THIS REPORT.

MY PARENTS ARE OUT OF TOWN
UNTIL TOMORROW.

THEY'RE AT
THE "UP WITH JESUS" FESTIVAL
IN OHIO.

DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER FAMILY
IN THE AREA?

THERE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HER
A CALL THEN?

WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S KIND OF MOODY.

LISTEN, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO PUT YOU
IN THE LOCKUP THEN.

IT'S UP TO YOU.
[ Man ]
I'M GONNA MESS YOU UP.

I'M GONNA MESS YOU UP.
I'M GONNA MESS EVERYBODY UP!

I'M GONNA GRAB YOU
BY THE EYEBALLS AND SNAP
YOUR HEAD LIKE A CHICKEN!

[ No Audible Dialogue ]

YOU HAVE TO TALK
INTO THE MICROPHONE.

OH.

[ Blows ]

WELL, ANYWAYS,
ADAM, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

I MEAN, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
TOUCHING ANYTHING BACK THERE.

NO, NO, I'M NOT, AMBER.

LOOK, IT'S ALL
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

GOOD. I SHOULD HOPE SO.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
DEAD MAN WALKINGHERE.

WHAT DID YOU DO?

YOU SEE--

I SORT OF SAW THIS GIRL
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

WHAT?
AND FOR SOME REASON,

BECAUSE I'M 18 NOW,
AND SHE'S STILL 15--

WAIT. YOU WERE
SEEING A SOPHOMORE?

KIND OF. SEE, SHE MOVED IN
WITH US THE OTHER DAY...

BECAUSE WE WERE
TELLING HER--
WHAT?

I KIND OF
GOT HER PREGNANT.
[ ANGRY YELLING ]

[ Banging ]

OW!

YOU OKAY?

JUST-- JUST TELL ME
YOU DON'T LOVE HER.

LOOK, I DON'T EVEN LIKE HER.
I LOVE YOU.

I NEED YOU SO BAD.

I PROMISE I'VE LEARNED
THE ERROR OF MY WICKED WAYS.

I'VE MADE
A LOT OF MISTAKES.
I KNOW THAT.

BUT RIGHT NOW,
WHAT I NEED MOST IS...

IS YOUR FORGIVENESS.

OH, AND CAN YOU FIND
MY PARENTS AND TELL THEM
TO GET ME A LAWYER?

[ Amber ] CHUCK VERY WELL
COULD HAVE BEEN THE FISHERS'
FIRST MISTAKE.

WELL, SECOND.

ADAM. I'M CHUCK CLOPPERMAN.

HI, MR. CLOPPERMAN.

PLEASE, CALL ME CHUCK.

ADAM, YOUR PARENTS HAVE
HIRED ME TO REPRESENT YOU
IN THE MATTER AT HAND.

I WANT YOU TO REST ASSURED
THAT YOU ARE IN
GOOD HANDS NOW, SON,

AND THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

HOW MUCH LONGER WILL
I HAVE TO BE IN HERE?

THERE'S ULTIMATE FIGHTING
ON PAY-PER-VIEW TONIGHT.

WELL, FORTUNATELY FOR US THEN,

WE WERE ABLE TO SCHEDULE
YOUR ARRAIGNMENT
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

I'M GOING TO ASK THE JUDGE
TO RELEASE YOU ON YOUR OWN...
RECOGNIZANCE.

SO I'LL HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE
BY 6 P.M. AT THE LATEST, PAL.

NO PROBLEM.

YOUR REQUEST FOR
REDUCTION OF BAIL IS DENIED.

BAIL IS SET AT $20,000.

WELL, THAT DIDN'T GO
TOO BAD.

DIDN'T GO TOO BAD?
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU'D
GET HIM OUT ON HIS WORD.

NOW I'VE GOT TO PUT
THE HOUSE UP FOR COLLATERAL.

AL, IT'S NOT LIKE THE KID'S
GOING TO HIGHTAIL IT
TO COSTA RICA,

SO I THINK WE'RE OKAY.

OH, ON TO OTHER
IMPORTANT MATTERS.

I WANT YOU TO COME BY MY OFFICE
IN THE MORNING SO WE CAN
DISCUSS P.R. STRATEGY.

P.R.?
YEAH.

HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE
THE INEVITABLE THRONGS OF
REPORTERS, CAMERAS, LIGHTS,

TALK SHOW APPEARANCES.

OH, MY.

UH, CAN I GET
YOU FOLKS ANYTHING?

WATER? FINGER JELL-O?

COFFEE?
NO, THANK YOU.

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A PEN?

TAKE A PEN.
NO, COME ON, TAKE A PEN.

WELL, JUST ONE. THANKS.

AND I JUST LOVE
YOUR WOOD PANELING.

IT'S VERY CLASSY.

WOOD WARMS UP THE ROOM,
DON'T YOU THINK?
HONEY?

CHUCK, WE'RE KIND OF
IN THE DARK HERE.

WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT AND
I THINK I'VE COME UP WITH
A FAIL-PROOF STRATEGY.

PERCEPTION.
IT'S ALL ABOUT PERCEPTION.

I MEAN, TODAY,
WITH THE MEDIA OUTLETS,

THE INTERNET,
YOU KNOW, THE DISHES,
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF,

WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS
PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION.

TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
WHOLE JONBENET AFFAIR.
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

OH, BROTHER!
NOW THAT'S ONE LADY...

WHO NEEDS TO HAVE
A HEART-TO-HEART
WITH HER MAKER.

LOTS OF PEOPLE THINK
THAT PATSY RAMSEY
DID A BAD THING. WHY?

[ Fart ]
SOMEONE CUT THE CHEESE?

OH. THAT WAS ME.

I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

'CAUSE THAT WOMAN DIDN'T
HAVE THE PROPER SPIN.

I MEAN, IF THAT WOMAN HAD
HAD BETTER HANDLING, HUH?

I MEAN, EVEN IF SHE
SHED A TEAR OR TWO,

I'LL TELL YOU, WE'D BE
CALLING HER A SAINT...

AND GIVING HER
HER PICK OF
CROATIAN ORPHANS.

OH. HE'S GOING TO HELL.

THE PUBLIC IS GOING
TO BELIEVE ANYTHING
THAT WE TELL THEM.

ISN'T IT GREAT? HUH?

ISN'T THAT A SIN?

ANYWAY, WE--
WE DIGRESS.

THERE WE GO.
WHAT'S THIS?

THIS IS THE STRATEGY.
YOU READ, DON'T YOU?

THERE.

WE ARE GONNA TELL EVERYONE
HOW MUCH ADAM AND GINGER
ARE IN LOVE.

BUT I LOVE AMBER.

NOT ANYMORE YOU DON'T.

HE LOVES AMBER.
SHE'S A LOVELY GIRL.

PEOPLE, PEOPLE,
TRUST ME, TRUST ME.

WE FOLLOW MY GAME PLAN,

NOTHING WILL GET IN THE WAY
OF OUR VICTORY.

[ Amber ]
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ADAM,

CHUCK WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE
HATCHING A PLAN.

LYDIA STONE, ASSISTANT D.A.
AND WANNABE MAYOR,

WAS ABOUT TO MAKE ADAM
THE POSTER CHILD FOR
HER ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?

YOU'RE MY CAMPAIGN ADVISOR.
ADVISE ME, YOU LITTLE MAGGOT.

WELL, PART OF THE PROBLEM IS
THAT, AS AN ASSISTANT D.A.,

YOU DON'T HAVE
THE HIGHEST OF PROFILES.

WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOU,

AND YOUR NEW LOOK JUST
ISN'T CUTTING IT ANYMORE.

WE NEED AN ISSUE.

AN ISSUE?
YES.

WE NEED PEOPLE TO THINK
THAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT SOMETHING.

I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT--
OTHER THAN BEING MAYOR.

OH.
I'M SURE WE'LL COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

IT'S JUST AN ISSUE.
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

OKAY, ISSUES.
ISSUES, ISSUES, ISSUES.

WELL, HELP ME OUT HERE.
WHAT ARE SOME ISSUES?

WELL, THIS IS AMERICA.
THEY'RE ENDLESS.
THERE'S GUN CONTROL.

AGAINST IT.

PROSTITUTION.
FOR IT.

TEENAGE PREGNANCY.
OH, PLEASE!

DON'T GET ME STARTED
ON TEENAGERS.
WHAT NOW?

THERE'S ALL THESE FILES
INVOLVING DELINQUENT
TEENAGE CRAP.

STATUTORY RAPE.
HE'S 18, SHE'S 15 AND PREGNANT.

THIS COULD WORK.

WHAT?
THIS IS PERFECT.

SEX OFFENDERS.
I LOVE SEX OFFENDERS!

YOU COULD BE
AGAINST THEM.
OKAY.

ARE YOU SURE THIS IS AN ISSUE
PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT?

LYDIA,
THIS IS THE BIBLE BELT,
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

OKAY.
[ Chuckles ]

THIS ISN'T THE BIBLE BELT,
YOU MORON.

BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW THAT.
NO, THEY DON'T.

OH, I'M GONNA THROW THE BOOK
AT THIS KID.

AH!
OH. YOUNG ADULT.

THANK YOU.

GUILTY.

SAY IT. GUILTY!
GUILTY!

[ Amber ]
WHILE LYDIA PLOTTED
THE YOUNG ADULT'S FUTURE,

ADAM MET WITH
THE YOUTH PASTOR...

TO WORK OUT
THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES
OF HIS NOW COMPLICATED LIFE.

I KNOW WE CAN STILL DO IT,
AND IT WON'T GET
INTO THE BABY'S FACE,

BUT I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO FROM
A RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE.

[ Amber ]
GINGER FINALLY HAD
SOME POSITIVE ROLE MODELS,

NOT THAT IT HELPED.

ARE YOU ON
FRIGGIN' CRACK?

GINGER, HONEY,

WE DON'T USE
LANGUAGE LIKE THAT
AT THE DINNER TABLE.

I DON'T LOVE YOU.
I LOVE JOHNNY.

YEAH, I KNOW, OKAY?
I DON'T LOVE YOU EITHER.

IT'S JUST A PERCEPTION THING
FOR ALL THE STUPID PEOPLE.

CHUCK'S SURE
IT'LL GET ME OFF.

BUT JOHNNY'S GETTING PAROLED
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

GINGER, ALL WE
HAVE TO DO IS LIE.

WHOA!
LYING IS A SIN, ADAM.

WE'RE EMBELLISHING.

SO WHETHER YOU LOVE GINGER,
MARY ANN OR THE PROFESSOR,

IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

HERE, HONEY, I KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU LIKE WIENERS.

WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF OPTIONS, HERE.

YOU GUYS AT LEAST
LIKE EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

HMM.
I NEVER REALLY EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

I MEAN, HE JUST GIVES ME
REALLY GOOD BONE.

HONEY?

[ Knock On Door ]

YEAH?

YOU KNOW, SON, I...

I FEEL PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED.

COOL. THANKS, DAD.

IT'S OBVIOUS YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES, HUH?

YEAH.
[ Snickering ]

BUT THERE ARE...

ALTERNATIVES.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

IT'S CALLED...

MASTURBATING.

DAD...

IT'S NOTHING TO BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT, SON.

COME ON.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW.

I DIDN'T GET THESE CALLUSES
WORKING IN THE GARDEN.

COME ON.
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.
DAD, I ALREADY KNOW HOW.

THEN WHY AREN'T YOU DOING IT?

I DO.

WELL, THEN WHY AREN'T YOU
DOING IT MORE OFTEN?

WHENEVER YOU GET THE URGE,
JUST POLITELY EXCUSE YOURSELF,

WHIP IT OUT
AND WAKE UP MR. FLOPPY.

DON'T TELL YOUR MOTHER,
BUT I THINK THE QUICKEST WAY
TO HEAVEN...

IS WITH HALF A JAR
OF PETROLEUM JELLY
AND A CHAMOIS LEATHER GLOVE.

FOR GOD SAKES, SON,
JUST LEAVE THESE GIRLS ALONE.

JUST FOR THE TIME BEING,
OKAY? EH?

YEAH.

ALL RIGHT, SLUGGER?

OH, AND, SON,
ONE MORE THING.

LET'S KEEP THIS LITTLE TALK
JUST BETWEEN OURSELVES, OKAY?

YOUR MOTHER, SHE--
SHE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

UH, DAD?

YEAH.
OW!

[ Toothbrush Scrubbing ]

???? [ Soft Jazz ]

[ Purring ]

AL? I'M ALREADY LOTIONED.

???? [ Record Scratches ]

[ Sighs ]

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

I'M GONNA GO
BUFF THE PIG.

OKAY, DEAR.

???? [ "William Tell Overture" ]

[ Yelling ]

???? [ Humming ]

MORNING, HONEY.
HEY.

LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY GOT UP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BED.

OH, YEAH.

GOOD MORNING, YOU TWO.

MOM, WHAT'S UP?

WE'RE PUTTING ON SOME
SCENES FROM THE BIBLE
FOR THE CHURCH PRESCHOOL.

I'M A STONING VICTIM.
PANCAKES?

NO TIME FOR BREAKFAST
THIS MORNING, HONEY.

BUT, AL, I MADE
THE HAPPY FACE PANCAKES.

YOU KNOW,
WITH THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS.

YOU KIDS REMEMBER
EVERYTHING YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SAY AND DO IN SCHOOL?

YEAH, NO SWEAT.

[ Door Closes ]

YOU LOOK GREAT, MOM.

I'M STONED.

[ Amber ] SADLY,
ADAM WAS FORCED TO PRETEND
THAT HE REALLY LIKED GINGER.

HE'S A REALLY GOOD ACTOR.

IF YOU REALLY LOVED ME,
YOU'D BE CARRYING
MY BOOKS.

EWW.
SO DO WE HAVE TO BE
FRIENDS WITH HER NOW?

ADAM!
???? [ Record Scratches ]

UH-OH.

LOOK, I-- I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU, BABY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THIS HO-BAG?

HEY!
EWW!

JUST COME HERE.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

IF YOU WEREN'T
THE MOST POPULAR GUY
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

I WOULD SO BE
BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

BABY, WILL YOU JUST
LISTEN TO ME FOR ONE SECOND?

GINGER AND I HAVE TO PRETEND
THAT WE'RE DATING AND IN LOVE.

COME ON. YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT?

WHAT KIND OF MORON WOULD
TELL YOU TO DO THAT?
CHUCK DID.

I'M SORRY.
WAS I TALKING TO YOU?
NO, I DON'T THINK I WAS.

WELL, HE DID.
MY LAWYER SAID...

THAT IF EVERYONE
THINKS THAT I'M INNOCENT,

I COULD GET OFF.

HAVEN'T YOU GOTTEN OFF
ENOUGH ALREADY?

BABY, I LOVE YOU.

THAT IS NOT THE PLAN.

YOU MAKE MY HEART SING
WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC.

YEAH, I ALREADY HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

AND HE TREATS ME REAL GOOD.

HOW NICE FOR YOU.
YOU CAN HAVE ADAM.

THIS IS JUST SO
WE CAN GET A SETTLEMENT.

SETTLEMENT?

CHUCK SAID THAT IF WE
GET THROUGH THIS PART,

WE'LL BE ABLE TO SUE
THE STATE OR THE PRESIDENT
OR SOMETHING AND GET CASH.

HE DID.

REALLY?

LIKE HOW MUCH ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

LIKE A WHOLE TRUCKLOAD.

HMM.

THIS WILL MAKE ME LOOK
REALLY, REALLY STUPID.

WHO CARES IF IT'S GONNA
MAKE YOU LOOK STUPID?

I DO!

WHAT IF I GET CHUCK
TO PUT A SPIN ON THE STORY?

WOULD THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

HMM. WELL, HOW LONG
UNTIL WE GET THE MONEY?

AS SOON AS ADAM GETS OFF
AND I HAVE MY BABY,
THEN I'M SO OUT OF HERE.

BESIDES, JOHNNY ALREADY HAS
A TRAILER PICKED OUT
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

AWW. THAT'S REALLY GREAT,
LITTLE WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS,

EXCEPT I DON'T CARE
AND WOULD YOU MIND
SHUTTING UP?

BECAUSE I WASN'T
TALKING TO YOU!

BITCH.

WHAT DID YOU
JUST CALL ME?

I SAID "BITCH."

[ Girls Yelling ]

[ Yelling Continues ]

[ Amber ]
THE SKANKETTE HAD LANDED ADAM
IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

THE ONLY PLACE LEFT
FOR HIM TO GO...

WAS A MUSIC-ACCOMPANIED MONTAGE.

???? [ Grunge Rock ]

?? I'VE MEMORIZED THE BASICS ??

?? MAKING STRANGE FACES ??

?? SWIM SLOWLY FOR I KNOW ??

?? THERE'S A THOUSAND MILES
  TO GO ??

?? WITHOUT BLINKING ??

?? I GRAVITATE SPACEWARDS ??

?? FIND A HOME FOR THE HEAD ??

?? FROM MY BASEMENT ??

?? NO DARKNESS EVER LEFT ??

?? THIS IS THE NOISE
  THIS IS THE SOUND ??

?
?? HERE COMES THE WARM MACHINE ?

???? [ Fades ]

[ Lydia ]
AS YOU KNOW,
I'M RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

AND THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

THIS HAS TO DO WITH
THE STAGGERING SPEED AT
WHICH OUR NATION'S MORALS...

ARE SPIRALING
OUT OF CONTROL.
JUST STICK TO MY SCRIPT.

OR MORE SIMPLY PUT,
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG.

WHAT ADAM FISHER DID
WAS WRONG.

THERE WAS A TIME WHEN
WE PUNISHED SUCH BEHAVIOR
WITH APPROPRIATE MEASURES.

UNFORTUNATELY,
CASTRATION HAS BEEN DEEMED
CRUEL AND UNUSUAL.

THEREFORE, I INTEND
TO SEEK THE HARSHEST
POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT...

UNDER COMMON
"CRIMINAL CODDLING" LAWS.

THAT IS 40 YEARS
IN THE STATE
PENITENTIARY.

UP THE RIVER.
DOWN THE RIVER.

THE BIG HOUSE.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

AND REMEMBER,
VOTE STONE.

AND I MEAN BUSINESS.

WELL, FOLKS,
WE'VE HAD A SLIGHT SETBACK.

HOW MUCH IS THIS ONE
GONNA COST ME?

FOR SOME REASON,
ASSISTANT D.A. STONE...

IS TAKING OVER
FOR THE PROSECUTION.

THAT CRAZY LADY
WHO'S RUNNING
FOR MAYOR?

WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.

ALL I KNOW IS THAT
SHE'S COMING AT US
FULL FORCE.

BITCH.
HONEY, NOT IN FRONT
OF THE KIDS.

IT'S TRUE, MS. STONE
IS A VERY AGGRESSIVE
PROSECUTOR.

[ Mr. Fisher ]
GREAT.
THERE GOES THE HOUSE.

SO I'M UP FOR A LITTLE
BIGGER OF A CHALLENGE.

BUT NOTHING THAT I CAN'T
HANDLE, OF COURSE.

CHUCK,
I WAS JUST WONDERING,

IS THIS TRIAL THING GONNA
HURT ADAM'S CHANCES OF
GETTING INTO A GOOD COLLEGE?

NO, NO.
HIS GRADES WILL DO THAT.

MRS. FISHER, PLEASE.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.

I'M GONNA DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER...

TO MAKE SURE THAT ADAM
DOESN'T GO TO PRISON.

[ All ]
PRISON?

THAT'S WORST CASE SCENARIO,
FOLKS. WORST CASE.

CHUCK, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "PRISON"?

WELL, UH,

UNLAWFUL SEXUAL CONTACT
WITH A CHILD ON MORE THAN
THREE OCCASIONS...

IS A CLASS "B" FELONY
AND CARRIES A MAXIMUM
PENALTY OF... 40 YEARS.

FORTY YEARS? ALL HE DID
WAS KNOCK UP THIS
WHITE TRASH SLUT!

DON'T YOU THINK
WE'RE OVERREACTING HERE?

GIRLS TODAY ARE PRACTICALLY
LINING UP TO BE--

STATUTORILY RAPED?
YES!

MR. FISHER,
I HAVE GIVEN THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT,

SO YOU CAN ALL REST ASSURED
KNOWING THAT ADAM
IS IN MY HANDS.

WE APPRECIATE
ALL YOUR HELP, CHUCK.

WE'D BE LOST
WITHOUT YOU.

THANKS, BABY DOLL.

OH, RIGHT.
THERE IS ONE MORE THING.

OH, JEEZ.
I KNEW IT.
THE BILL.

YEAH. APPARENTLY, MS. STONE
FOUND OUT THAT GINGER WAS
LIVING IN YOUR HOME...

BECAUSE SHE FILED A MOTION
FOR A NO-CONTACT ORDER
BETWEEN ADAM AND GINGER.

MR. FISHER, YOU ARE TO HAVE
NO FURTHER CONTACT
WITH THIS YOUNG LADY,

WHO SHALL BE REFERRED TO
FROM NOW ON BY HER INITIALS,

WHICH ARE G.A.G.

[ Amber ]
YUP. IN MY EYES,

THE U.S. LEGAL SYSTEM
WAS WORKING JUST FINE.

NOW ADAM AND I WERE
HAPPILY TOGETHER AGAIN,

AND I WASN'T ABOUT
TO LET HIM GO ASTRAY.

HI.

LOOK, I HAVE TO STOP BY
CHUCK'S OFFICE AFTER SCHOOL.

OH, GREAT.
WHAT FOR NOW?

I DON'T KNOW.

THAT GUY
GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

WELL, GINGER THINKS
HE'S KIND OF SEXY.

OH, YEAH?

WELL, GINGER'S BRAIN
IS ALSO THE SIZE OF A LEGO!

ADAM! ADAM!
HERE HE COMES.

HOW DOES IT FEEL,
BEING FORCIBLY SEPARATED
FROM THE GIRL YOU LOVE?

WILL YOU ABIDE
BY THE JUDGE'S DECISION?

MISS, WHAT'S YOUR
RELATION TO ADAM?

I'M--
A FRIEND. AMBER.

AMBER IS ADAM'S
LITTLE LESBIAN FRIEND,

HERE PROVIDING SUPPORT
IN THIS-- HIS TIME OF NEED.

I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO COME ALONE.
[ Reporters Yelling ]

[ Chuck ] ADAM WILL BE MAKING
AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT
JUST IN A FEW MINUTES.

IN THE MEANTIME,
PLEASE PARTAKE
IN THE REFRESHMENTS.

OH. HI,
MR. AND MRS. FISHER.

WELL, HELLO, SWEETHEART.

A LESBIAN?
[ Chuckles ]

WHAT'S WITH ALL THE REPORTERS?
ALL PART OF
MY MASTER PLAN...

TO GET YOU
OFF THE HOOK, PAL.

SO, HERE.

THIS IS A STATEMENT
I'VE PREPARED FOR YOU
TO READ.

WE REALLY GOT TO PLAY UP
THAT ROMEO AND JULIET
ASPECT.

HEY, DIDN'T THEY DIE
AT THE END?

THEY DO?

WOW. THE CASE AGAINST YOU,
ADAM, IS PRETTY STRONG.

IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU
SLEPT WITH GINGER SOME, UH,

THIRTY-NINE TIMES.

OH, YOU--

WHAT WE'VE GOTTA DO IS
RAISE PUBLIC SUPPORT
FOR YOUR CAUSE.

BY THE TIME I'M DONE,

THE PUBLIC
WILL BE OUTRAGED
AT THIS UNJUST LAW...

THAT WOULD SEPARATE
AND PUNISH TWO PEOPLE
SIMPLY FOR FALLING IN LOVE.

THAT SOUNDS COOL.

OH, YEAH.

COOL?

COOL?

ALL GINGER AND I EVER WANTED
WAS TO BE HAPPY TOGETHER.

WE NEVER MEANT
TO HURT ANYONE.

NOW, WE'RE BEING FORCED
TO PART AT A TIME...

WHEN SHE MOST NEEDS
MY LOVE AND ATTENTION.

BUT, STILL, I INTEND
TO DO WHATEVER POSSIBLE...

TO PROVIDE FOR HER
AND OUR FAMILY.

THEREFORE, I WILL BE
DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL
IMMEDIATELY--

RIGHT ON.

AND WILL BE GETTING A JOB
SO THAT I MIGHT PROVIDE
FOR OUR FAMILY.

CHUCK, MY DAD
ALREADY HAS A JOB.

KEEP READING.

I ALSO INTEND TO ASK GINGER
FOR HER HAND IN MARRIAGE.

[ Gasps ]

THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY
AT THIS TIME.

THANK YOU
FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

AND, PLEASE, ONLY ONE
DOUGHNUT PER PERSON.

ADAM!
WHERE'S GINGER?

THAT'S ALL, FOLKS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AND PLEASE GO
AND SPREAD THE WORD.

MOM, DO I REALLY HAVE
TO MARRY GINGER?

HONEY, THAT IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
BUT I DON'T LOVE HER.

LOTS OF GUYS GET MARRIED
TO WOMEN THEY DON'T LOVE.

I READ THAT SOME WOMEN
DON'T HAVE SEX
WITH THEIR HUSBANDS...

BECAUSE THE MEN
DON'T HAVE A CLUE
HOW TO BRING THEM TO ORGASM.

BUT ISN'T IT WRONG TO GO
TELLING EVERYONE I LOVE HER
WHEN I DON'T?

SOMETIMES IT'S OKAY
TO TELL LITTLE WHITE LIES.

ESPECIALLY THE ONES
THAT CAN KEEP YOU
OUT OF PRISON.

HOW CAN IT BE OKAY
TO LIE ABOUT SOMETHING
SO IMPORTANT?

EITHER LOVE
THE LITTLE TRAMP...

OR YOU'RE GONNA BE
GETTING SOME
TOUGH LOVE...

FROM YOUR CELLMATE
UP AT THE STATE PEN.

SO THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN
BUBBA SAYS, "SPOT ME
IN THE WEIGHT ROOM."

YEAH.

"BUBBA"?

IT'S A GENERIC
PRISON GUY. BUBBA.

BIG, MUSCLEY,

SOUTHERN?
AND DOMINANT.

[ Amber ]
WHILE CHUCK'S SPIN
WAS TAKING EFFECT,

THE REAL STORY TOOK A TURN
AS GINGER FOUND HERSELF IN THE
HOSPITAL EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.

WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO
TO GET A BEER AROUND HERE?

NATURALLY,
HER MOTHER WAS CONCERNED.

[ P.A. ]
NURSE JAMISON TO THE O.R.

DR. MOYLE,
PLEASE REPORT TO PEDIATRICS.

DR. MOYLE TO PEDIATRICS.

[ Ringing ]

I'LL GET IT.

HELLO?
HI. I HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.

I HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

WHAT HAPPENED?

I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST KINDA IT CAME OUT
BEFORE IT WAS DONE.

WOW.

I GUESS IT WAS
GOD'S WAY OF TELLING ME
I'M NOT READY TO BE A MOTHER.

YOU THINK?

SO ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY
AND ALL?

YEAH. THE NURSE SAID
MY MOM CAN ONLY STAY
TILL 7:30.

ANYHOW, I BETTER
GET OFF THE PHONE.

MY MOM HAS TO CHECK IN
WITH HER PAROLE OFFICER.

OKAY. BYE.
BYE.

WHO WAS THAT, SWEETIE?

GINGER.

OH, HONEY,
SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO CALL HERE.

THAT'S A NO-NO.
YEAH, BUT...

DON'T TALK BACK
TO YOUR MOTHER.

I THINK SHE SHOULD
DO HER HAIR DIFFERENTLY.

MY DAD SAYS
SHE'S A LA-LA-LESBIAN.

THAT'S WHY SHE'S PUTTING
THE SCREWS ON ADAM.

IMAGINE. KEEPING HIM
AWAY FROM THE GIRL
HE LOVES.

WELL, THE BOY DID BEHAVE
IRRESPONSIBLY.

HAVE YOU NO SENSE
OF ROMANCE?

HOW COMEINSIDE SCOOP
DOESN'T WANT
TO INTERVIEW ME?

[ TV ]
TONIGHT, ONINSIDE SCOOP,
THE CONSEQUENCES OF TEEN SEX.

MY CLIENT IS
A VICTIM OF LOVE.

NO MORE, NO LESS.

ADAM AND GINGER ARE
VERY MUCH A MODERN DAY
ROMEO AND JULIET.

FORCED APART...
NOT BY THEIR FAMILIES,

BUT BY THE VERY LAW
THAT IS MEANT TO ENSURE
LIBERTY TO ALL CITIZENS.

WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THE
PUBLIC WILL BE OUTRAGED AT
THIS MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.

ADAM, TELL ME,
HOW DOES IT FEEL...

KNOWING THAT YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO BE WITH THE ONE
YOU LOVE DURING HER PREGNANCY?

UH...

BAD. REAL BAD.

[ Amber ]
ADAM'S A BRILLIANT ACTOR.

LIKE JAMES VAN DER BEEK
BRILLIANCE.

THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS
BACKING ADAM AND GINGER
IN THEIR PLIGHT.

BEHIND ME, YOU SEE
SOME AVID SUPPORTERS.

AND ALSO THE LOCAL CHAPTER
OF THE SCOUTS...

IS HOLDING A SPAGHETTI
DINNER AT THE VFW,

AND ALSO THE ACLU
WILL HAVE A CAR WASH.

ALL THIS IN THE HOPES
OF RAISING MONEY...

TO HELP PAY FOR ADAM FISHER'S
GROWING LEGAL FEES.

[ TV Off ]
YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO TELL ME...

THIS IS JUST A DREAM
ANY TIME NOW.

WE JUST HAVE
TO SIT TIGHT
AND RIDE IT OUT.

RIDE IT OUT?
THE SCOUTS ARE INVOLVED,
YOU MORON.

WE EXPECTED SOME OF THIS
TO HAPPEN.
WE DID?

THE MEDIA'S PORTRAYING ME
AS A PSYCHOTIC, POWER HUNGRY,
MAN-HATING BITCH.

IT'S NOT AS BAD AS THAT.
OH, NO?

HAS EVERYONE
COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN
THAT HE BROKE THE LAW?

[ Amber ]
I REALLY WAS
TRYING TO BE CALM.

BUT IT'S JUST VERY HARD WHEN
THE FUTURE YOU'VE PLANNED SINCE
MEETING ADAM IN 6th GRADE...

IS IN JEOPARDY.

MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
SOME MORE OF THESE.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

DO NOT TRY
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

CHUCK SAYS THAT
YOU SHOULD TAKE THOSE.
DICK.

NO, CHUCK.

ADAM, IF YOU MARRY HER,

WE ARE OFFICIALLY OVER.

ALL CHUCK WANTS TO DO
IS KEEP ME OUT OF PRISON.

PRISON?
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO PRISON
FOR KNOCKING UP THAT HO?

IF ALL THE GUYS THAT SCREWED HER
WENT TO PRISON, THEY'D HAVE TO
ADD ON ANOTHER WING.

YOU THINK
SHE SLEEPS AROUND?

AHEM. DOES ICE MELT?

AMBER, YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME
WHEN I SAY THAT EVERYTHING
I'M DOING HERE IS FOR US.

I FIND THAT A LITTLE
HARD TO BELIEVE.

AS SOON AS THIS IS OVER,
I'M GONNA DIVORCE HER
AND GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.

CHUCK THINKS IT'D LOOK GOOD
IF I GOT A JOB.

WE WORKED SO HARD
TO RAISE YOUR G.P.A.
TO A D-MINUS.

I KNOW, BUT IF I GET A JOB,
EVERYONE WILL THINK I WANT
TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY.

[ Groans ]

I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS MY LIFE.

ISN'T HE SMART?

HE THINKS OF EVERYTHING.

[ SIGHING ]

[ Amber ]
BOYS AND THEIR CARS.
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

ANYWAY, EVEN THOUGH
ADAM WAS CHARGED
WITH A SEX CRIME,

WOMEN FROM ALL OVER
NOW FOUND HIM IRRESISTIBLE.

THIS DID POSE
A MORAL QUANDARY,

BUT IT JUST REINFORCED
MY AFFECTION FOR HIM.

YOU KNOW,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
OTHER GIRLS LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

AWESOME!
?? SOME PEOPLE TELL ME
  I'VE GOT A BAD ATTITUDE ??

?? 'CAUSE I GREW UP
  LEARNIN' TO BE RUDE ??

?? IT FEELS GOOD ??

THAT JUDGE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT ME CONTACTING YOU,
DID HE?

NO, I GUESS NOT.

AND...

MY MOM'S OVER
AT BIBLE STUDY.

NO. I JUST CAME OVER 'CAUSE
I WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

GOOD-BYE?

YEAH. I'M MOVING TO NEW YORK
TO LIVE WITH MY STEPDAD.

I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE'S A HOMO.

WELL, HE IS,
BUT MY MOM'S A FREAK.

YEAH,
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

SO I GUESS I WON'T BE
SEEING YOU AROUND ANYMORE.

NO, BUT IT'S KINDA BETTER
THAT WAY, YOU KNOW,

'CAUSE EVERYTHING'S
GOTTEN SO CRAZY.

ALL WE DID
WAS DO THE NASTY.

SO, DO YOU WANT
TO DO IT AGAIN?

THIS KID DOESN'T
SCREW THINGS UP,
I'M HOME FREE.

ALL RIGHT.

I'M HOME FREE.

I'M HOME FREE!

WHO'S HOME FREE?

CHUCKIE'S HOME FREE,

DOESN'T SCREW IT UP!

IF CHUCK WASN'T SUCH A MORON,

HE'D HAVE KNOWN THE ODDS OF
ADAM NOT SCREWING THINGS UP...

WERE PRETTY MUCH
NEXT TO NOTHING.

HELLO?

[ Mrs. Fisher ]
ADAM, HONEY, I'M HOME!

OH, MY GOD,
IT'S MY MOM.

HEY, SWEETIE!

UH, HI, MOM.

CAN YOU GO TO THE KITCHEN
FOR A SECOND?

WELL, YES, I CAN,
BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO?

WELL, I WANTED
TO ASK YOU ABOUT--

ASK YOU ABOUT JESUS.

YEAH, I HAVE SOME
JESUS-TYPE QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

TALK ABOUT PERFECT TIMING.

BROTHER THOMAS HERE
HAS COME OVER FOR COFFEE.

HE JUST FINISHED SEMINARY,

AND HE'S HEADING OUT TO TEACH
THE HEATHENS ABOUT JESUS.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT, THOMAS?
YES, MA'AM.

I'M GOING TO ASSUME
MISSIONARY POSITION
FOR THE CONGREGATION.

YOU MEAN, LIKE,
DURING THE SERVICE?

NO. I'LL BE DOING IT
OVER IN CHINA.

OH.

[ Mrs. Fisher ]
WHY DON'T I WHIP UP
SOME DEVILED EGGS,

AND YOU TWO
CAN TALK SHOP, OKAY?

GREAT.

ALL RIGHT.

YEAH.

COME ON.

GOSH, IT'S SO EXCITING
GOING TO A FOREIGN LAND.
OH, YEAH.

YOU KNOW, I BET THEY MAKE
SOME GREAT CHINESE FOOD
OVER THERE IN CHINA.

ACTUALLY, NOT.

OH.

I CAN GIVE YOU

TO TAKE OVER THERE.

?? I MIGHT WALK A LITTLE FUNNY

?? I MIGHT STUTTER WHEN I TALK

?? I AIN'T GOT NO MONEY

?? I DON'T KNOW WHY I COME HERE

?? IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
  I WANNA BE ??

?? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH ????

[ Amber ]
I KNOW, BUT THAT
REALLY DID HAPPEN.

GINGER, DON'T THEY TEACH YOU
ANYTHING ABOUT SAFE SEX
OUT THERE IN THE BOONIES?

DAD, SHUT UP.

IS IT CHANGING?

ARE YOU SURE
WE DID IT RIGHT, HONEY?

DAD, TRUST ME.
I HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE.

YOU KNOW,
I AM SO NERVOUS.

OLIVER, WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN?

GINGER, THAT'S NO WAY
TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER,
ESPECIALLY--

OH!

WE'RE GONNA BE GRANDPARENTS!
[ Laughing ]

I'LL GET TO DECORATE
THE BABY'S ROOM AND EVERYTHING!
IT'S GONNA BE SO GREAT.

GINGER, HONEY?

YOU HEARD ME.
I'M PREGGERS AGAIN.

DAMN, I'M GOOD.

YEAH, THANKS A LOT.

HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

WELL, YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO WEAR A CONDOM.

???? [ Men Singing ]
YEAH, AND YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO REMIND ME.

WHAT'S THAT
IN THE BACKGROUND?

OH, THAT'S JUST
MY STEPDAD AND OLIVER.

ARE THEY DOING IT?

NO, YOU MORON.

THEY'RE DANCING AROUND THE ROOM,
SINGING SHOW TUNES.

WHOA, ROCKY WAS RIGHT.

SO, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO TELL PEOPLE?

WELL, DID YOU TELL
ANYONE BUT YOUR MOM
ABOUT THE MISCARRIAGE?

UM, NO.

WELL, IF WE WANT A SETTLEMENT,
WE JUST WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

NOBODY WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

OKAY. WELL, LOOK, I GOTTA GO.

JOHNNY'S PAROLE HEARING
IS IN AN HOUR.
BYE.

WHO WAS THAT, HONEY?

UH, AMBER.

HOW IS THE LITTLE ANGEL?

FINE.

YOU TELL HER TO COME OVER
FOR DINNER SOON.
AHEM!

UH, ON SECOND THOUGHT,
YOU BETTER NOT.

UNLESS SHE'S
ON HER PERIOD.

OH, LOOK!

YOU KNOW HOW
YOU LOVE REDDI-WIP!

[ Amber ]
AS THE TRIAL APPROACHED,
THINGS GOT WEIRDER AND WEIRDER.

I WAS FORCED TO ENDURE
MORE AND MORE INDIGNITIES.

EWW.

WHAT DOES THAT
FINGER THING MEAN ANYWAY?

DAMN IT.

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

THEY'RE TRYING TO
PUT A SPIN ON OUR SPIN.

YEAH, WELL, DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I'M GONNA
SPIN 'EM RIGHT BACK.

I'M GONNA NAIL
THAT ADAM FISHER,

AND THEN I'M GONNA NAIL
THAT CHUCK CLOPPERMAN, TOO.

GOOD!
ARE WE READY?

YEAH.

ARE WE GONNA WIN?
OH, YEAH!

WHO'S YOUR HONOR?
YOU'RE MY HONOR.

CALL ME YOUR HONOR.

[ Shouting ]

[ Amber ]
FINALLY, THE TRIAL CAME.

ADAM ARRIVED AT THE COURTHOUSE
TO A HERO'S WELCOME.

JESUS LOVES YOU!

LYDIA STONE WAS
A BIT LESS FORTUNATE.

HELLO, GATLINERS.
[ Booing ]

[ Woman ]
GOD BLESS YOU,
MS. STONE!

SISTER, HI, HOW ARE YOU?
GOD BLESS YOU.

HE'LL BURN IN HELL!

[ Lydia ]
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THEY DON'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH
TO VOTE ANYWAY.

OH, MY GOD.
RUN FOR IT!

[ Amber ] WHEREAS THE ENTRANCES
MIGHT'VE BEEN EXPECTED,

THE TRIAL WAS ANYTHING BUT.

YOU MAY PROCEED,
MS. STONE.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

HOW OLD ARE YOU, G.A.G.?

UH, MY BIRTHDAY
IS NEXT WEEK.

UH, PLEASE JUST ANSWER
THE QUESTION, SWEETIE.

OH. FIFTEEN AND A HALF.

FIFTEEN AND A HALF YEARS OLD.

AND, UH, DO YOU
HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

YEAH, BUT HE'S IN PRISON.

I OBJECT, YOUR HONOR!
SHE'S DOING A THING!

[ Judge ]
OVERRULED.
I AM NOT DOING A THING.

I'M--
OVERRULED.

WELL, SHE'S--
DOING A THING!
I HAVE RULED!

I'M NOT DOING A THING.

PRISON, MISS G.A.G.?

UM, WELL--
[ Taps Desk ]

SINCE WE'VE BEEN RIPPED
FROM EACH OTHER'S LIVES,

IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE
IN A TYPE OF PRISON.

I SEE.

ARE YOU CURRENTLY PREGNANT?

YES.

YES?

HOW TERRIBLY TRAGIC,
ISN'T IT?

THAT A YOUNG GIRL
DOES NOT HAVET HE CHANCE
TO ENJOY HER TEENAGE YEARS.

BUT I AM ENJOYING
MY TEENAGE YEARS.

HOW DO YOU THINK
I GOT PREGNANT?

YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T GET WHY EVERYONE IS
SO INTERESTED IN ADAM AND ME.

I MEAN, YOU OLD PEOPLE DO
SOME PRETTY SCREWED-UP STUFF.

I READ THOSE PAPERS IN LINE
AT THE GROCERY STORE,

SO I KNOW WHAT
I AM TALKING ABOUT.

I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE
SNIFFING KOOL-AID AND
HIRING TRANSVESTITE HOOKERS!

AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO
MENTION THAT CIGAR THING,
AND NOBODY CARES.

SO WHY IS EVERYONE
GETTING INTO OUR FACES ABOUT
GETTING IT ON A FEW TIMES?

I MEAN, I LIKE DOING IT.

AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I WANTED TO DO IT.

AND... ADAM'S A REALLY NICE GUY.

NOT TO MENTION REALLY HUNG.
OKAY, WELL, THEN!

THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

DONE WITH THIS ONE.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

[ Judge ]
MR. CLOPPERMAN,
YOUR WITNESS.

THANK YOU.

HI.

HERE, HONEY.
YOU MIGHT NEED THESE.

GINGER, ARE YOU IN LOVE--
PLEASE REFER
TO OUR UNDERAGE WITNESS...

BY HER INITIALS,
MR. CLOPPERMAN.

SORRY.

G.A.G., ARE YOU IN LOVE?

YES.

AND EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE, UH, 15 AND A HALF,

DON'T YOU FEEL
LIKE AN ADULT?

OBJECTION, YOUR--
OBJECTION!

HELLO.
SORRY.

LEADING THE WITNESS.
SUSTAINED.

FINE. I WILL
REPHRASE THE QUESTION,
IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

[ Chuckling ]

REPHRASE. UH--

G.A.G.

AHEM. HOW DO YOU FEEL?

WELL, OTHER THAN
SOME MORNING SICKNESS AND
OCCASIONAL CONSTIPATION--

MENTALLY.
OH.

OLD.

OLD!

OLD.

NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.
YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

PLEASE CALL
THE NEXT WITNESS.

MR. FISHER,
I BELIEVE THAT'S YOU.

LET ME REMIND YOU, MR. FISHER,
YOU ARE STILL UNDER OATH.

HE KNOWS.

IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND.

Y-YES, SIR.

[ Chuckling ]

HELLO, MR. FISHER.
SO YOU ADMIT TO SLEEPING
WITH G.A.G.

YES, MA'AM.

ON MORE THAN
THREE OCCASIONS BETWEEN
OCTOBER 24 AND NOVEMBER 26?

WELL, A LOT MORE.

[ Laughter ]

AND WHAT WERE YOUR AGES
AT THIS TIME?

I WAS 18.

18 YEARS OLD!

AND G.A.G.?

OH! DID I SAY
SOMETHING FUNNY,
MR. FISHER?

NO, MA'AM. I JUST REALIZED
GINGER'S INITIALS SPELL--

OH, EVERYONE KNOWS
WHAT THEY SPELL,
MR. FISHER.

I AM THROUGH
WITH THIS YOUNG ADULT.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

MR. CLOPPERMAN.

PRESENT!

[ Laughing ]

OH.

SO, UH, ADAM.

UH, YOU AND GINGER
PLANNED TO MA--
[ Judge ] COUNSELOR!

THAT'S THE SECOND TIME.

WHAT?
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME,
YOUR HONOR.

NO, IT'S NOT. YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S THE SECOND TIME.

NO, I'M RIGHT.
IT'S THE THIRD TIME.

FINE, WHATEVER. ADAM,

YOU AND G.A.G.,
YOU PLAN TO MARRY,
IS THAT RIGHT?

YES. WE LOVE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH,

AND WANT TO BE UNITED
IN GOD'S EYES.

GOD'S EYES.

GOD'S... EYES.

SO WHY DID YOU TWO DECIDE
NOT TO MARRY, ADAM?

UH, WE, UH--

UH...

NO, WAIT. UH--

OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!
OBJECTION TO HIS OBJECTION!

MR. CLOPPERMAN,
YOU'RE DOING
THE QUESTIONING.

I KNOW THAT.

WE DIDN'T!

WE-- WE DIDN'T.
THAT'S RIGHT.

THE COURT ORDERED US
TO BE PARTED,

AND WE CAN NO LONGER
SEE EACH OTHER.

OUR TRUE LOVE WAS... SQUASHED.

QUASHED.
YEAH. QUASHED.

HAVE YOU SEEN G.A.G.
SINCE THE COURT
TORE YOU APART?

N-NOT REALLY.

"NOT REALLY,"
YOUR HONOR?

ANSWER THE QUESTION
EITHER YES OR NO.

NO...

TREALLY.

YOUR HONOR!
"TREALLY"?

WILL YOU REPEAT
YOUR ANSWER--
"TREALLY" MEANS "NO"!

JUST ONE WORD.

NO.

BUT...

BUT, WELL, I JUST
WANT TO SAY THAT...

I KNOW THE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE THE LAWS,

THEY HAVE THEIR REASONS AND ALL,

AND I'M USUALLY PRETTY GOOD
AT NOT BREAKING THEM.

LOOK, WHAT I MEAN IS,

I GUESS I KINDA SCREWED UP,

AND... I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

WHEN MIKE MUBORN
BLEW UP THE CHEMISTRY LAB
TRYING TO BUILD DYNAMITE,

AND ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS PICK UP TRASH.

SO I THINK IT'D BE
A LITTLE UNFAIR IF GET
LOCKED AWAY FOR 20 TO 40.

DON'T YOU?

I DO!
[ Laughs ]

ABSOLUTELY.

ADAM, G.A.G. HAS TESTIFIED
THAT SHE IS PREGNANT
WITH YOUR BABY.

ARE YOU GONNAA
SUPPORT THAT CHILD?

YES. YES, I WILL.

THAT'S VERY NOT GUILTY
OF YOU, ADAM.

YOUR HONOR, PLEASE!
STRIKE THAT.

THE JURY WILL DISREGARD
MR. CLOPPERMAN'S
LAST COMMENT.

SORRY. I WAS JUST
THINKING OUT LOUD.
[ Laughs ]

NO MORE QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

[ Judge ]
YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

[ Adam ]
YES, SIR.

BEFORE I SEND YOU
TO DELIBERATE,

LET ME REMIND YOU
NOT TO LET YOUR EMOTIONS
AFFECT YOUR DECISION.

IF YOU THINK THAT ADAM FISHER
COMMITTED THE ACT
THREE TIMES WITH G.A.G...

BEFORE SHE REACHED
THE AGE OF 16,

YOU MUST FIND HIM GUILTY.

[ Amber ]
OKAY, SO MY BOYFRIEND KNOCKED UP
AN UNDERAGED GIRL TWICE.

DOES THAT MEAN HE HAS TO SPEND
MY CHILDBEARING YEARS
BEHIND BARS?

I PRAYED THAT THE JURY
WOULD SEE BEYOND THE HYPE,

THE SENSATIONALISM,
THE CHEAP, TAWDRY DETAILS
OF ADAM'S INDISCRETION...

AND SEE HIS INNOCENT,
GIVING SOUL.

WE ALL NERVOUSLY AWAITED
THE VERDICT.

?? AN ARTIFICIAL SEASON ??

?? COVERED BY SUMMER RAIN ??

?? LOSIN' ALL MY REASON ??

?? 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHIN'
  LEFT TO BLAME ??

WELL, HE ADMITTED
SLEEPING WITH HER, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

AND SHE ADMITTED
SHE WAS 15.

AND HE ADMITTED
HE WAS 18, SO...
HE'S GUILTY.

HE'S GUILTY.

?? SHADOWS PAINT
  THE SIDEWALK ??

?? A LIVING PICTURE
  IN A FRAME ??

?? SEE THE SEA OF PEOPLE ??

?? ALL THEIR FACES
  LOOK THE SAME ??

?? SO I SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE ??

?? FORCING A SMILE ????

[ Amber ]
ADAM WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

HE WAS INCAPABLE
OF DOING ANYTHING ELSE.

HE WAS CRYING OUT FOR HELP.

BUT SOMETIMES...
[ Knocking ]

THE DISTANCE YOU HAVE
TO WALK TO ANSWER A DOOR...

IS JUST TOO FAR TO GO
TO HELP SOMEONE.

REV, ARE YOU IN THERE?

THAT DOOR IS JUST...
TOO DAMN FAR.

THIS IS STUPID.
WHO HERE HASN'T HAD SEX WITH
A HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE?

I SURE HAVE.

WELL, I MEAN,
WHEN WE WERE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

RIGHT. RIGHT.

WILL THE DEFENDANT
PLEASE RISE?

THIS COURT FINDS THE DEFENDANT
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

SENTENCING TOMORROW AT 3:00.

MAN!

THAT TOTALLY SUCKED!

GUILTY? GUILTY?
AL, LOOK, IT'SINSIDE SCOOP.

TV. IS MY FOREHEAD SHINY?

YOU SAID YOU COULD
GET HIM OFF, NO PROBLEM!

THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I HIRE A LAWYER OFF TV!

NO PROBLEM!
NO PROBLEM!

THE LORD TELLS US
TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

WELL, SCREW THAT!

JUSTICE WAS SERVED.
I KICKED ASS!

I WON! I WON!
I'M GONNA BE MAYOR NOW!

VOTE FOR STONE.
THANKS TO ME,
WE'RE GONNA BE MAYOR.

VOTE FOR STONE.

WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

WHAT ABOUT
THE WHITE PICKET FENCE,

THE DINNER PARTIES,
THE MINIVAN?

IF HE GOES TO PRISON,
I MAY NOT LOSE MY VIRGINITY
FOR 40 YEARS!

[ Amber ]
THEY ACTED LIKE
HE WAS A MARTYR,

LIKE JOHN THE BAPTIST
OR KURT COBAIN.

THAT'S WHEN I BEGAN TO WONDER
IF WAITING TO LOSE MY VIRGINITY
WAS SILLY...

WHEN I HAD A REAL-LIFE MARTYR
FOR A BOYFRIEND!

A FUZZY PIG
AND A PRAYER
FOR A PREDATOR.

ADAM FISHER STANDS
TO RECEIVE UP TO
40 YEARS IN PRISON...

AND WILL BE
FORCED TO REGISTER
AS A SEXUAL PREDATOR...

FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE.

THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S PRAYERS
ARE WITH ADAM FISHER,

WHO, NO DOUBT, TONIGHT
IS SPENDING THE EVENING
IN QUIET CONTEMPLATION.

I WONDER IF THEY'LL LET YOU
COME HAVE SEX WITH ME
IF I GO TO PRISON.

LET'S NOT EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT.

WELL, IF NOT, THIS MIGHT BE
OUR LAST CHANCE TO BE
TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME.

YEAH.

MAYBE WE SHOULD
MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT
LITTLE TIME WE HAVE LEFT.

I WANT IT TO BE MAGICAL,

AN EXPERIENCE
YOU'LL REMEMBER FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

ADAM--

[ Mrs. Fisher ]
DINNER WILL BE READY
IN FIVE MINUTES!

THAT GIVES US
PLENTY OF TIME.
[ Giggles ]

[ Amber ]
YES, I GAVE MYSELF TO ADAM...

ON THE NIGHT BEFORE
HIS SENTENCING.

I SPENT THE REST OF THE NIGHT
TRYING TO REMEMBER
IF I WAS OVULATING.

[ Bailiff ]
ALL RISE!

GATLIN COUNTY
SUPERIOR COURT
IS NOW IN SESSION.

THE HONORABLE
JUDGE RAYMOND E. ZIFF
PRESIDING.

YOU MAY BE SEATED.

[ Judge ]
WILL THE DEFENDANT
PLEASE RISE?

THIS COURT IN NO WAY CONDONES
UNDERAGE SEXUAL RELATIONS.

HOWEVER, I FIND MYSELF
HARD PRESSED...

TO SEND THE DEFENDANT
UP THE RIVER FOR 40 YEARS...

BECAUSE HE GOT LUCKY
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

THEREFORE, MR. FISHER,
I AM SENTENCING YOU
TO TWO YEARS...

PROBATION.

AND AS FOR THAT REQUIREMENT
THAT YOU REGISTER
AS A SEXUAL PREDATOR,

IT'S REQUIRED
BY THE STATUTE,

SO I'M AFRAID
THAT MY HANDS ARE TIED.

BUT GOOD LUCK, ADAM.

I WANT TO THANK
THE COMMUNITY FOR
THEIR INCREDIBLE SUPPORT...

AND THAT JUDGE, TOO.

OKAY, I'M GONNA THROW IT
OVER TO ADAM HERE.

HE'S GOING TO TAKE
A FEW QUESTIONS BEFORE
I GIVE YOU ANY MORE DETAILS...

ABOUT MY BOOK SIGNING TOUR.
[ Reporters Yelling ]

HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE TO
REGISTER AS A SEXUAL PREDATOR
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

WELL, IT KINDA SUCKS.

I MEAN, NOW I WON'T BE ABLE
TO COACH KIDS' BASEBALL...

OR BUY A GUN
OR BE THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

HOW DO YOU AND GINGER
PLAN TO CELEBRATE
YOUR FREEDOM...

AND WHEN DO YOU
PLAN ON GETTING MARRIED?

WELL, GINGER AND I
KIND OF BROKE UP.

THAT'S ALL THE TIME
THAT HE HAS FOR--
FOR YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW,

BUT I GOT LOTS OF TIME,
SO, UH, LET'S GET IT ON.

OKAY, SO THE TITLE OF MY BOOK
ISUNLAWFUL ENTRY:
THE ADAM FISHER STORY.

IF ORDER ONE RIGHT NOW,
YOU'LL GET A SPECIAL COPY
OF MY WORKOUT VIDEO...

HOW TO GET GREAT ABS
IN JUST THREE HEARINGS.

[ Amber ]
WITH THE WHOLE MESS BEHIND US,

ADAM AND I CAN GET
OUR LIVES BACK...

AND ENJOY
EVEN DEEPER TRUE LOVE.

SEE, SWEETIE, I WAS THINKING
MAYBE WE COULD GO BACK
TO MY PLACE...

AND CELEBRATE YOUR VICTORY.

JEEZ, I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE KINDA BEEN
THINKING, TOO.

I'LL HAVE YOUR BABY! I'M 16!

I LOVE YOU, ADAM!
I WANNA HAVE YOUR BABY!

MARRY ME, ADAM,
I LOVE YOU!

WHAT DO YOU SORT OF THINK
ABOUT SEEING OTHER PEOPLE?

[ Girls Screaming ]

[ Amber ]
SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN,

I KNOW HE REALLY
COULDN'T MEAN THAT.

HE WAS JUST IN SHOCK
FROM THE TRIAL.

HE LOVES ME TOO MUCH
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

[ Screaming ]
I JUST HAD TO REMIND HIM.

?? I DON'T BELIEVE
  WHAT HE SAID ??

?? I CAN GO ANYWHERE ??

?? I CAN HOLD MY HEAD UP ??

?? I CAN BREATHE IN THE AIR ??

?? I'M NOT OFFICIALLY DEAD ??

?? I STILL HAVE A HEART ??

?? NOT OFFICIALLY DEAD, YEAH ??

?? I STILL HAVE A HEART ??

[ Amber ]
I MAY HAVE
GONE ABOUT IT BADLY,

BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IN THE END IS THAT WE
LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES...

AND GROW AS INDIVIDUALS.

?
?? I REMEMBER THE TIMES YOU'D
  RIDE YOUR BIKE PAST MY HOUSE ?

?? I WANNA KNOW YOU SO BAD ??

?? KNOW YOU INSIDE AND OUT ??

?? YOU'RE OFFICIALLY DEAD ??

?? YOU DON'T HAVE A HEART ????

???? [ Piano ]

AH! OOH!

MY!

[ Amber ]
ANYHOW, YOU'RE
PROBABLY WONDERING...

WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERYONE
AFTER THE TRIAL.

[ Ginger Screaming ]

[ Grunting ]

[ Baby Crying ]

[ Amber ]
AFTER A COUNTY RECORD
OF 98 HOURS OF LABOR,

GINGER PRODUCED A BABY GIRL,

THUS PROVING THAT
SHE'S NOT ALWAYS EASY.

GINGER,
CAN I TOUCH IT?

NO WAY!
HUSH, JOHNNY!

GINGER'S MINE NOW,
ASS WIPE!
HE MEANS THE BABY.

[ Crying ]

SHH SHH SHH!
HERE, BABY, COME HERE.

GIVE IT TO JOHNNY.
GIVE IT TO JOHNNY.

THERE YOU GO.

WHAT'S ITS NAME?

WE DECIDED TO NAME HER "T-BONE"
AFTER JOHNNY'S CELLMATE.

[ Crying Continues ]
OH, WAIT, WHAT'D I DO?

HERE, HERE. YOU'RE JUST
HOLDING HER WRONG.

[ Ginger ]
JOHNNY KNOWS ALL ABOUT BABIES.

HIS SISTER HAD A COUPLE
BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH,

AND HE HELPED
TAKE CARE OF THEM.
PUT YOUR HAND HERE.

HE'S GONNA BE A GREAT DADDY.
THERE YOU GO.

THERE YOU GO.
[ Laughs ]

YEAH. YEAH.

[ Amber ]
ALTHOUGH LYDIA
LOST THE ELECTION,

HER NEWLY FOUND CELEBRITY
LANDED HER A TALK SHOW ON CNBC,

WHICH WAS CANCELED
AFTER SIX SHOWS.

SHE FOUND A BETTER OUTLET
FOR HER TALENTS ON
THE HOME BUYING CHANNEL.

DON'T FORGET TO ORDER
THIS LIMITED EDITION...

ADAM AND GINGER
DINNER PLATE SET.

THAT'S RIGHT, LYDIA.
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.

THE PAINTING THAT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE...

IS BAKED RIGHT IN
SO IT WON'T CHIP OR FADE.

[ Lydia ]
MM-HMM. THESE ARE A MUST-HAVE.

AN EXCELLENT BARGAIN,
AND DISHWASHER-SAFE
AS WELL.

WE HARDLY HAVE ANY LEFT,
SO GET ON THAT PHONE
AND CALL 555-LONG.

I HAVE SOME OF THESE
AT HOME, CHUCK.

[ Amber ]
ADAM DID DROP OUT OF SCHOOL
BEFORE GRADUATION,

AND ONCE AGAIN FOUND HIMSELF
AT THE LITTLE CHICKEN.

HE HAD A FEW LEGAL BILLS.

AND LET'S FACE IT--
SCHOOL WAS JUST NEVER HIS THING.

[ Whistling ]
[ Amber ]
IT WASN'T LONG...

BEFORE ANOTHER BABY
GOT STUCK IN A PIPE SOMEWHERE--

ARKANSAS, I THINK--

SO THE PRESS ESCAPED
OUR SMALL, PICTURESQUE TOWN,

AND ADAM'S PARENTS QUICKLY
FOUND THEMSELVES BACK TO NORMAL.

AL?

IT'S BLUE.

[ Amber ]
WELL, ALMOST.

OH, MY.

AS FOR ME,

WELL, I'M DOING JUST FINE.

AFTER THE LITTLE INCIDENT
WITH ADAM'S CAR,

I AGREED TO MAKE A FEW SPEECHES
AT LOCAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
ON THE DANGERS OF TEEN SEX.

I'M A VERY GIVING PERSON.

I AM.

[ Amber Narrating ]
AFTER ALL WE WENT THROUGH,

WE PATCHED THINGS UP
AND EMERGED CLOSER THAN EVER.

IT TOOK A LITTLE NUDGING
ON MY PART,

BUT EVENTUALLY I GOT ADAM
TO POP THE QUESTION.

HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

[ Amber ]
ADAM STILL HAD
SOME GROWING UP TO DO,

BUT I'M LEARNING TO BE PATIENT.

WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER
FOR A LONG,

LONG TIME.

ADAM!

SO YOU SEE,
STORIES DO HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS.

NO, REALLY! THEY DO!

HERE, BABE.

THANKS, BABE.

LET ME JUST GET THESE
HANDLEBARS FOR YOU.

?? I GUESS WE'VE HAD OUR FUN ??

?? BUT IT SEEMS THE FUN
  IS OVER NOW ??

?? AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT ??

?? IT'S ALL RIGHT ??

I CALLED YOU A BITCH,
WHICH YOU MOST DEFINITELY ARE!

[ Giggling ]

HOW DO YOU-- HOW--
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

OTHER THAN MORNING SICKNESS
AND OCCASIONAL CONSTIPATION--

I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT,
BUT MENTALLY.

HELLO?

[ Judge ]
MR. FISHER,
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND?

YES, SIR.

CUT!
SHE LOVES HER CORN.

WHAT HAND ARE YOU COUNTING ON?
SECOND TIME.

THIRD TIME.
SHUT UP.

WHERE YOU GOING?

I'M GONNA DO THE DANCE
WITH THE JUG-EARED MAN.

FORGOT TO FLOSS.

I'M GONNA BEAT OFF.

THAT'S NICE, DEAR.

OKAY, I OBJECT, YOUR HONOR!
HE'S LEADING HIMSELF!

I'M SORRY, I--
WE NEED TO STOP
FOR A SECOND.

ALL RIGHT, I'M LACTATING
AND I'M LEAKING RIGHT NOW.

PARTY ANIMAL.

[ Judge ]
YOU'RE ASKING
THE QUESTION.

THANK YOU,
YOUR HONOR.
I KNOW.

AND ALL HE GOT WAS TO PICK OUT--
ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS
PICK UP TRASH.

LOOK, EITHER LOVE
THE LITTLE TRAMP,

OR YOU'RE GONNA BE
GETTING SOME TOUGH LOVE...

FROM YOUR CELLMATE
UP AT THE STATE PEN.

SOAP ON A ROPE
SO YOU CAN GET IT BACK.
GOT IT?

WHAT THE HECK
YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S A HYGIENE THING, HONEY.

UH, IT'S
A WORKOUT METAPHOR.

[ No Audible Dialogue ]

HI.

I WANNA TRY OUT
MY NEW WATER PIK.

YOU'RE MY HONOR.
CALL ME YOUR HONOR.

[ Adam ]
THERE'S ULTIMATE FIGHTING
ON PAY-PER-VIEW TONIGHT.

OH. OH, YEAH?

YOU ANYBODY'S BITCH YET?

WHAT?
SOUND GOOD?

COOL.
NO PROBLEM.

W-WE CAN'T DO IT
ANYMORE?

I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE?

WE CAN'T DO IT
ANYMORE?

WELL, FOLKS--

WAS YOUR BED GOOD, HONEY?

HAVE YOU BEEN
BONING HER AGAIN?

OH, NO.

[ Giggling ]
