<i>[man] Does knowing someone for years</i>

<i>allows you to stick your finger
in their mouth?</i>

<i>Can you make the finger bloody as well?</i>

<i>A sadness creeps over me
as I look out the window.</i>

<i>Again I see-
why are some poles stretching for miles?</i>

<i>I sit for a long time
watching the fires burn.</i>

<i>Isolation is all I can feel.</i>


We're gonna be having a tough time
making that-

that sheriffs station anyway.

So what do we do about that?

We'll come back to it in a second,
but it's a problem.

Poor Diane in the Red Room...

we'll have to move to a different stage.

For Diane in the Red Room-

<i>we have to move to</i> a <i>different stage.</i>

<i>[man] How the fuck are we gonna do that?</i>

She's got to-she's got to tum <i>into-</i>

turn from Naido to herself.


She's got a scene
in the sheriff's station-

sheriffs office.

<i>And that takes us to-</i>

<i>boom, black, and never-never land,</i>

<i>and then it takes us to the boiler room.</i>

[woman] Mm-hmm.
[man] Easy to do.



the first time we're in the Red Room.

Yeah, it'll be my finger.
Okay. Okay, good.

Dough? What are you telling me?

It's bread dough.

All right, before we get there...

Okay, now hold that.
Hold that, hold that.

[Lynch] Huh?
Let me breathe-.

I forgot about that.


[Lynch] Okay.
[Laura] Good thing it's my last day.

I forgot. I'm sorry. I-l swear I did.


That's okay. You don't need me after this.

Are you sticking your finger in my mouth?

[Lynch] I'm gonna do it.
[Laura] Oh, God.

[scoffs] I-I-
[Lynch] I'm gonna put it in your mouth.

[Laura] I don't like it.
I'm gonna put it in your mouth.

Get up out of the chair

<i>III</i>

<i>[man] Burnt feet across heated rocks.</i>

<i>No cinders are to be found.</i>

<i>When was</i> a <i>visit to this place
where time stands still?</i>

<i>Drinking black coffee
and cherry pie to eat.</i>


Now, you don't know how to open a door,

so some other people are coming to work,
and you kind of go in, you know,

<i>when they, you know-</i>

someone will do it for you.

First you wait. You wait...
[Kyle] Yeah.

...by the door, and then someone
will come in, and you go in, okay?

We'll work it out.
[Kyle] Perfect.

You walk up. You're waiting for him
by the side of the counter, okay?

You're waiting for him,

<i>and you see him coming in, and now
on your face is some trepidation.</i>

But you-when he comes in,
and he sees you, you-

a big smile, put your arm around him,
that's, you know,

"I'm gonna get you a coffee,"
and you say, "Coffee."

Yeah, for the big guy, a cup of coffee.

And you head off, and then we cut.

<i>Um Right here?</i>

<i>[Lynch]
Now we're sitting in the restaurant.</i>

<i>You are in the blue chair.
You are in the red chair.</i>

You have access to a sight of pie.

You-the waitress brings the coffees.

He has his coffee.
You have your coffee.

And you're looking at him,
and you're looking at the coffee.

And then he sees the pie,

and he gets up.

Well, isn't that a beautiful break?
And you look around.

People are reading or talking,

and you bring the coffee up,

and you surreptitiously, you know,

put the crystals in,

and you put it back over there.

Okay. Meanwhile, you're in-
the waitress says,

"Cherry-you want some cherry pie?

I'll bring it to you.
Go enjoy your coffee."

And so you say "coffee" again.

<i>- And you go over.
[Kyle] Right.</i>

and you see dandruff on his back,</i>

<i>and you think he's feeling sorry for you,</i>

<i>and he's-he's, you know, like this,</i>

but he's really playing
with your dandruff, right?

And he's now like this,
and you start breaking down,

and you're saying,
"Oh, my God, what have I done," right?

rubbing your shoulders,

and you reach out, and you get
that coffee, and you're sobbing,

<i>and you race out,
and you're running.</i>

<i>You're sobbing across the-
you throw open the stall,</i>

<i>and you dump it down in there, right?</i>

<i>And the guy peeing over there says,</i>

"That bad, huh?"

And-and it goes like that. Okay?



That's inspired comedy, it truly is-.

Just from the depth of your souls, Tom,

the depth of your soul, you're so sorry.

You're-you're dying.

Okay. Just let-
feel the-feel the-

start rubbing his back.

Stan coming apart.
Don't-don't come apart all the way yet.

Just trembling, trembling,
trembling, trembling.

[Tom sobbing] Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

I never meant to hurt anyone.

Okay, just set it-set it down.

"I never meant to hurt anyone.
I'm so sorry."

Get this from the depth
of your fucking soul, man.


And be-try to be-
try to offer it to him one last time.

Offer it to him.

Oh, God!

I'm so sorry.
I never meant to hurt anyone.

Get going. Get going.

Here's your cherry pie.

[Tom crying]

Cut it!

<i>You know, do we have Curl do W?</i>


Bullshit.
[woman laughing]

Cori-it'd be fun to watch her do it,

'cause now she knows
what it's supposed to sound like.

I might have Cori do it.
[man] Okay.

That would be fun.

Wilson, Headley.
[Owain] Morning, David.

' HÂ°W You guys doing?
[Owain] How's it going?

Great.

Okay, Wilson, you'll be coming in
and announcing Gordon Cole.

You'll leap to your feet,
pick up the phone,

and-and both of you-
you'll be wearing headsets.

Mm-hmm.

And both of you,

when Cole starts talking,

you'll pull your phones away,

<i>and you'll pul your phone away</i>
a <i>little bit.</i>

<i>- Just because it's painful.
[Owain] Mm-hmm.</i>

You pick up the phone,
it starts going loud,

and-and you're listening.

You hear it very clearly,

and then when you get to
Douglas Jones business,

you settle down a little bit, sit down,

<i>and rapidly type in.</i>

<i>Then you report to Wilson,
and after there's a click, hang up.</i>

You report to Wilson, and then you say,

"How in the world are we gonna find them?"

And then you-start it with "Wilson."
[Jay] Okay.

And really give it to him.
[Jay] You got it.

And we'll cut right in the middle of that.

Okay, let's take a rehearsal
and see how it-how it goes.

Okay, action, Wilson.

Okay, Headley, jump up faster

"Gordon Cole," and it sets you up.

[Jay] Yeah, I can do it.
Yeah? Okay.

And that-everything else is real good,
real good.


Okay, Headley.
[Jay] Sir?

You can speak a little louder

and more urgently to Cole.

Okay, new, don't sit down
till he finishes speaking.

In other words, when you say "Yes, sir,"
when you're down, keep-"Yes, sir!"

[Jay] Okay. Okay, you got it.
You know, you be sharp.

Okay.
Be sharp and-and pumped.

Okay, don't-there's 23 Douglas Jones

[Owain] Yeah. Yeah.
So keep it-

Pump it up.
Keep that star power going.

[Owain] Yep.
[Lynch] For Gordon.

<i>I woman vocalizing â™ª</i>

<i>III</i>

<i>[man] Why is the man
with the gray elevated hair so angry?</i>

<i>Does money buy happiness for the people
in the boxes below?</i>

<i>Do they wish they had more
for themselves?</i>

and then set up that other scene.

Um, what do you mean, a cleanout?

pull our stuff back, and-

No, don't-
[man] People can step away.

People could step away
and go get a coffee,

and let me have Rod and Candie.

Rod and Candie, and I want the-

the soft foam remote

and the regular remote.
[man] Okay.

Okay?
[man] Perfect.


<i>Or we might leave it there,
bause we-we use it, but...</i>

You're out here.
Mm-hmm.

And you're following a fly, okay?

And you have a red handkerchief, and you-
you're going like this.

<i>And you go like this,
and it flies out of your hand, right'?</i>

<i>And then you look where it's going,
but then you see the fly,</i>

and it goes around his chin, okay?

So we have a-you-you just-
it's on you.

You're just looking,
like, real intense.

<i>And you're moving pretty fast
on this one.</i>

And then you come in close,

and you're watching up in here,

Oh, this is so beautiful.
Oh!

is maddening to me.</i>

<i>Down there, below the smoke and fear</i>

<i>is the answer to the question.</i>

<i>The brothers Fusco, Battling Bud,
and Jane y-E</i>

<i>at! trapped in a room,
showing us what we need to see.</i>

we move into the insurance company.

<i>Maâ€œ Qâ€œ. bay.</i>

Okay, so Thursday is Naomi's last day,

so I know what that is-.

The three Fusco brothers come in.

Well, first Rhonda comes in,
says the police are out there.

<i>They want to talk to you,
and she goes like this.</i>

[man] <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- [Lynch] And so Cooper goes like this.</i>

"Oh, you want him to come in here? Fine."
She goes out.

They come in, three detectives,

and trailing the three detectives,

pretty quickly, is Naomi-

is-is Janey-E.

And she comes in, and she's-
"What's going on?"

She comes up next to Cooper.

<i>So now we're over the two of them,</i>

<i>and I'll probably be right between them</i>

<i>and the three detectives,
and then Mullins comes in.</i>


Mm-hmm.
[man] And we have all day to do it.

I think we're fine.
We're gonna make that scene fantastic.

No problem.
[man] Yeah, yeah.

That's what I think, too.
[drumming on table]

which will be great.

Not to have a day that's impossible,
and we're worried, and, like, oh-

Yeah, but she's got a lot of dialogue.


Mm-hmm.
[man] It's a fun scene.

Yeah.

So, remember,
you were waiting out there for so long.

Door open, everything like this.

That fucking guy's not showing up, right?

So you march up to the thing.
[Naomi] Yeah.

And then you see these guys go in,
you know, like this.

[Naomi] Yeah. Look through the window.
So-you know, yeah.

And you're look-and they're going
into Dougie's office, right?

<i>So you come in here.
You're-I mean, he's fate.</i>

<i>And now there-there's these, you know,</i>

<i>you get the vibe it's-
it's detectives, police.</i>

Good to see you guys. Rhonda's gonna...

And you say, "What's going on here?"

And-and so you're-you're irritated,

and you're-these things come out,
like, schoolmarm.

You know, like, you know-
[Naomi] Barbs.

Barbs, you know, and you're just on it.
[Naomi] Yeah.

<i>And in such a way {hat when they say,</i>

<i>"But we can talk about this tomorrow,"</i>

you know, when you-
when you're more calm.

So you're worked up
from the very beginning.

<i>Okay?</i>

<i>Not a calm scene.</i>

You keep it going, so that they see
that you're totally stressed,

and that-yeah, they-and they say,

"Don't worry. It's okay, ma'am."
[Naomi] Okay.

[Lynch] <i>Okay?
'</i> [Naomi] Okay.

When you come into the place,

it's more than a stolen car.

This car was blown up.
Mm-hmm.

And so this could be, you know-

this could be a deep, you know,
troubling (hing,

so it's not like-
y0u're-you're trying to get to the bottom

of why someone would want
to blow this guy's car up.

<i>And-and there's all these fatalities now
connected to it.</i>

<i>You're son of starting
to put two and two together</i>

<i>and seeing that it's no! really them,
but you're not sure.</i>

<i>So, when he says,
"Yes, we know where the ca! is,"</i>

you're coming clean,

but take a good look at both of them
on the-you know.

This guy's acting weird, and this guy-
and she's on a thing.

Is there anything else going on here?
Yeah.

And then at the same time, you know,
she's on a stress roll.

Right.
So then you say, "Okay, look, calm down.

We'll-you can do this tomorrow."

[Lynch] You're nice <i>to</i> her...
[man] Okay.

<i>- [Lynch] ...'cause she's light on edge.
[man] All right.</i>




<i>'</i> [man] Rolling.
<i>'</i> [man] Rolling.




Silver, four-door-

That makes you angry.

Just-just make-makes you sick
about that car, okay?

Okay, try that one more time,
and really, like,

"You crazy, you imbecile."
Okay, here we go.

Naomi, just say it again,
and be sick through the whole thing.

That car-a horrible car.

always in the shop-

No, I'll give you a reason-get-
now stay up on the high horse.

Okay, try it again.

Just-just say-just ask the question.

"Well, there's your answer."

Now you start thinking, "Wait a minute.
How did he know that?

What's going on? Did they find the car?

Have they been keeping something
from you?"

Look at those guys.
Just keep looking at-don't smile.

Just keep looking at them, like,
you're not working.

Okay, now do it again,
and then you're looking at them,

and then they/re detectives,
and they're police-

and in case you-
and don't start thinking like-

Now, that sort of pisses you off.

Thinking about that insurance.
That's another angle.

Maybe a better car.
Look-shoot daggers in their eyes.

You're not gonna make these-We're going.

You know, you like Mr. Mullins,
but just give him one good look,

and it's like, this is not the time.

This is not the time.

about those files

you covered for me, Dougie.

But you go ahead.

We'll take care of that-

Start pulling him out.
