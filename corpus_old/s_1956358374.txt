Dicky: From Hollywood â€ it's
â€œJimmy Kimmel liveâ€! Tonight â€â€

Zach galifianakis.
Speaker of the house Nancy

pelosi. "This week in unnecessary
censorship."

And music from alessia Cara.
And now, in all honesty, Jimmy

Kimmel!

[ Cheers and applause ]

Jimmy: Thank you very much.
Welcome. Hello, hello. I'm Jimmy.

I'm the host of the show.
Thanks for coming.

Thanks for watching at home.
Thanks to those of you who

joined us earlier tonight in
prime time for our NBA game

night special.
The NBA finals are under way.

The golden state warriors are in
it again taking on the Toronto

raptors. This is â€â€

[ cheers and applause ]

This is big for the players on
both of those teams because you

though, if they don't do well on
their NBA finals they won't be

able to get into a good college.

[ Laughter ]

The president has not weighed in
on this matchâ€up yet, but I

can't think of any two places
he'd be rooting for less than

Canada and the bay area.
It's like choosing between a

canker sore and chlamydia for
him.

[ Laughter ]

But the president did weigh in
on everything else today.

Yesterday as you know Robert
Mueller made a statement which

gave Trump something to get
worked up about.

He was up bright and early today
ranting and raving.

It was a category 5 tweetstorm
today.

[ Laughter ]

During which he inadvertently
made a bigly admission.

He wrote "Russia, Russia, raur.
That's all you heard at the

beginning of this witch hunt
hoax.

And now Russia has disappeared
because I had nothing to do with

Russia helping me to get
elected."

So Russia did help you get
elected!

[ Applause ]

I'm interested in this because
he â€â€ he knows we're seeing his

tweets, right?
Is it possible all this time he

thought he was texting with Eric?
Because â€â€

[ laughter ]

And by the way, if you want
everyone to stop talking about

Russia, maybe don't start a
tweet with "Russia, Russia,

Russia."
saying it three times like

you're trying to summon
beetlejuice or something.

That was at 8:00 a. M.
Less than an hour later he

wanders out on the White House
lawn to say Russia did not help

him get elected.

Did Russia help you get
elected?

No, Russia did not help me
get elected.

You know who got me elected?
You know who got me elected?

I got me elected.
Russia didn't help me at all.

Russia, if anything, I think
helped the other side.

Jimmy: Now, listen, I know
it's a little confusing.

Let me break it down in terms we
can all understand.

Basically, Russia is Lori
loughlin. Trump is her daughter.

And the election was a rowing
scholarship to usc.

Do you understand in

[ cheers and applause ]

The president also fielded
questions on the subject of

impeachment.
And that didn't make him happy

either.

Do you think they're going to
impeach you?

I don't see how.
They can because they're

possibly allowed, although I
can't imagine the courts

allowing it.
I've never gotten into it.

I never thought that would even
be possible, to be using that

word.
To me it's a dirty word, the

word impeach.
It's a dirty filthy disgusting

word.

Jimmy: That's right.
And he knows dirty filthy

disgusting words.

[ Laughter ]

In fact, he's on tape saying a
lot of them on a bus.

[ Cheers and applause ]

But Trump was in full super
villain mode this morning

insisting falsely that Robert
Mueller found him innocent and

screaming over the sound of a
helicopter.

It was like a scene out of "r
"Rambo: First blood 2."

So he said essentially you're
innocent.

I'm innocent of all charges.
And you know the thing that

nobody brings up, there was no
crime.

They're saying he's obstructing
something and there was no crime.

And nobody brings it up.
Also someday you ought to read a

thing called article 2.
Read article 2.

Which gives the president powers
that you wouldn't believe.

Jimmy: It gives him the power
to smell Kentucky fried chicken

from blocks away.

[ Laughter ]

Read article 2.

[ Cheers and applause ]

You know what?
He tells a lot of lies, but the

biggest lie of all may be
claiming to have read article 2

of the constitution.

[ Laughter ]

That did not happen.
The president's also pushing

back hard against reports that
the White House instructed the

Navy to hide the "USS John
mccain" from his view when he

was in Japan last weekend.
Reportedly, the White House

asked that the "USS mccain"
which is a warship named after

the late senator from Arizona be
hidden because it might upset

president baby hands.

[ Laughter ]

He even gave the sailors who
wear the "USS John mccain" cap

the day off.
Now, Trump claims he didn't know

anything about this.
And I actually believe him for

once. But that's the thing.
His staff is so abundantly aware

of the fact that he's insane
they had to move a warship named

after an American hero and tell
the sailors who work on it to

hit the road because they were
worried that if he saw it the

ship would hit the fan.

[ Laughter ]

That's what â€â€

[ applause ]

That's what we're â€â€ what
they've dealing with.

But I guess that's how you have
to handle a very stable genius.

You know?

[ Laughter ]

We have a great show for you
tonight.

From "baskets," his very funny
show on fx, Zach galifianakis is

here with us.

[ Cheers and applause ]

And from the house of
representatives, which is not a

show, though it siemz seems like
it is, speaker Nancy pelosi is

with us.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Really I hope she brought her
gavel with her.

Do you think she travels with
gavels? I don't know.

At Disneyland tomorrow I don't
know if you know about this but

they're having the grand opening
of star wars galaxy's edge.

[ Cheers and applause ]

This is basically â€â€ do we bring
in an extra load of nerds today?

[ Laughter ]

It's basically "star wars" land.
It's said to be a totally

immersive star wars experience.
You can stand in line to buy a

chur roe just like a remember of
the rebel alliance would.

[ Laughter ]

There is a millennium falcon
ride, a custom light saber shop,

a custom droid shop.
You can drink in the star wars

cantina.
And the best part is it's all

totally free. No, I'm kidding.
It costs a lot.

You may have to sell your
children to get in this.

[ Laughter ]

You also have to have a
reservation to get in which is

almost impossible to get because
it's so popular.

They think the place is going to
be filled to capacity for â€â€ at

this point it would be quicker
to just become an astronaut and

go to actual space than to try
to get in there.

I also mentioned that tonight
was game 1 of the NBA finals.

And this is the time of the year
when we have basketball on the

brain.
So I decided to pick the one of

the allâ€time greats, Karl Malone.
He's a 14â€time NBA allâ€star.

He makes a hell of a squirrel
stew too.

I sat with Karl to ask his
thoughts on an important subject.

And once again, the mailman
delivered.

â™ª

Jimmy: I'm here with Karl
Malone, the hall of famer.

He's a badâ€ass.
Karl, in your opinion, what is

the dumbest animal? Which one â€â€

cow.

Jimmy: The cow?

Yes.

Jimmy: Why do you say the
cow?

It can be a fricking monsoon,
and a cow is looking up.

Jimmy: Why do you think they
do that?

I have no idea.

Jimmy: There you have it.
The dumbest animal is the cow.

No. No. In my opinion.

Jimmy: According to Karl
Malone. I'm not arguing with you.

You seem like you are.
You seem like you're arguing

with me.

Jimmy: I would never, ever
argue with you.

You waited all this time get
me here and you're arguing with

me now?

Jimmy: I'm not arguing with
you now.

If I were to argue with you it
would make me the dumbest animal.

No, no.

Jimmy: Still the cow?

Yeah.
You're a pretty nice species.

Jimmy: Thank you.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Jimmy: Thanks to Karl Malone
and apologies to cows.

One more thing before we forge
ahead.

It is Thursday night which means
it's time to bleep and blur the

big TV moments of the week
whether they need it or not.

It is "this week in unnecessary
censorship."

[ Cheers and applause ]

We concluded that we would,
would not reach a determination

one way or the other about
whether the president [ Bleep ]

A [ Bleep ].

So the key there obviously
for barr is this butt [ Bleep ]

Sort of causality.

The spotlight quickly turned
to North Korea as the president

[ bleep ] The Japanese prime

minister.

My daughter's rolling her
eyes right now.

She's like dad, no more

[ bleep ] Jokes please.

[ Bleep ]Ing.

[ Bleep ]Ing.

[ Bleep ]Ing.

F [ Bleep ] [ Bleep ] kâ€Iâ€n.

Correct.

I'd now like to [ Bleep ] my
husband. Your commander in chief.

I'm going to ask you to stand
right where you're at.

Those of you who raised your
hand. Just be brave.

Give the devil a big black

[ bleep ].

Come on.

I've got to say the [ Bleep ]
fest right next to the stadium

is outstanding too.
And it is free.

And I'm going to roll this up
and put it in my [ Bleep ].

It doesn't take up any space,
ladies.

Where am I?

You're in the hospital,
silly. You broke your [ Bleep ].

The doctor said it was the
most tiny dried out underused

[ bleep ] He'd ever laid eyes

on.

Somebody cut it out.
Want to see it?

[ Cheers and applause ]

Jimmy: We've got a big show
tonight.

We've got music from alessia
Cara.

The speaker of the house Nancy
pelosi is here.

From "American idol" Lane Hardy
is sitting in with the cletones.

And we'll be right back with
Zach galifianakis.

[ Cheers and applause ]

â™ª

â™ª

â™ª put your light, put your light

up â™ª

â™ª put your light, put your light

up â™ª

Jimmy: Welcome back to the
show.

That is "American idol" winner
Lane Hardy sitting in with the

cletones.
Let me tell you something, if

you think Lane's handsome on TV,
you should see him in real life.

It's like â€â€

[ cheers and applause ]

It's like Elvis before the
peanut butter got a hold of him.

You know?

[ Laughter ]

Tonight on our show the speaker
of the house Nancy pelosi is

here with us. And then â€â€

[ cheers and applause ]

Her album is called "the pains
of growing."

Alessia Cara from the
mercedesâ€benz stage.

By the way, alessia is singing
the Canadian national anthem at

game 2 of the NBA finals Sunday
on abc.

Also on Sunday we'll be back
with l. L. Cool j, Tracy Morgan

and a dunk tank battle with
deeron fox of the Sacramento

kings.
That's Sunday at 7/6 central.

And after the game on the west
coast.

Our first guest is a strange and
wonderful man who if you can

spell his name, will Grant you a
wish. That's true.

He returns to his emmyâ€nominated
dual roles of the basket

brothers on the very funny show
"basketsâ€.

The new season premieres June
13th on fx. Please welcome Zach

galifianakis.

[ Cheers and applause ]

How are you?

I'm doing really well.

Jimmy: It's very good to see
you.

It's nice to be here.
Laine, I've got bad news for you.

Yeah.

I used to look just like you
when I was your age.

Jimmy: He's only 19.
Do you know that?

That's exactly how I looked.

Jimmy: Is that right?

[ Laughter ]

It doesn't end well.

Jimmy: You know you have a
hole in the armpit of your

sweater? Are you aware of that?
No, on the other one.

On the armpit.
Is that where â€â€ that one.

There you go.

[ Applause ]

That's on purpose for the
scratching.

I didn't know that.

Jimmy: It's a delight to have
you here.

It's a delight to be here.
Are we almost done?

Jimmy: Almost.

[ Applause ]

These are hard to do.

Jimmy: These are hard to do.
If you took off that sweater,

you'd anybody all denim,
wouldn't you?

I think the allâ€denim look's
coming back.

Jimmy: Is it?

Yeah.

Jimmy: Have you been hanging
around in Jay leno's garage?

[ Laughter ]

He does like denim.
He does. He loves denim.

Jimmy: Well, it's great to
have you here.

Thank you.

Jimmy: I'm always pleased to
have you here.

You know speaker of the house
Nancy pelosi is on.

Yes.
And I don't think I should be

first guest. I mean, this is â€â€

Jimmy: It's too late.

There were four giant suvs,
20 like security people.

She â€â€ the world's ending.
She should have been the first

guest. Not some washedâ€up bearded
comedian.

[ Laughter ]

I mean, I drove a Volkswagen
golf here.

[ Laughter ]

[ Applause ]

But I can't wait to hear what
fancy pelosi has to say.

[ Laughter ]

Jimmy: You know the best part
of the Volkswagen golf is I know

that there's an 85% you really
did drive a Volkswagen golf here.

I'd say it's a 100% chance.

[ Laughter ]

100%.

Jimmy: Last week I got to see
you and David letterman.

You sat down for an interview
with David letterman.

It was kind of a â€â€ it was just
like an industry event.

And it was a lot of â€â€ did you
have fun with that?

I did.
He interviewed me for something.

And still I don't even know what
it is. But â€â€

Jimmy: Well, his Netflix
show â€â€

I hear he has a show on
Netflix.

Jimmy: He does, yes.

But somehow â€â€ anyway, he
interviewed me. You were there.

It was a long â€â€ it was like an
hour and 20 minutes.

You know, I never know what to
talk about.

After the interview he handed
you an envelope.

Jimmy: Well â€â€

right?

Jimmy: No.
He handed you an envelope.

I thought â€â€

Jimmy: He showed it to me
first.

Okay.
So Mr. Letterman hands me this

envelope after I'd done thint
view with him.

And in my mind I thought oh,
it's going to be â€â€ I don't

know, a massage gift certificate.

[ Laughter ]

Jimmy: Can I tell you
something?

That's 100% what I thought it
was going to be too.

Or like a fancy â€â€ I don't
know. It was like a long business

envelope.

Jimmy: Yeah, it was like in a
hotel envelope.

And I get it.
And I can see he's still looking

at me, Mr. Letterman.
And I open it.

And it's just the lyrics to
"free bird."

[ Applause ]

He didn't even sign it.
And he's looking at me across

the room like pretty good gift,
right? It is the best thing.

It's the best thing I've ever
gotten.

Jimmy: My favorite thing
about it was that it was on two

pages.
There aren't that many words to

free bird. It woz as a twoâ€pager.
So impossible for framing.

But will you frame that?

I will frame it.

Jimmy: You will put that up
in your home.

Yes.
I was very honored that he â€â€

Jimmy: Did you send him a
thank you note for that gift?

He called me after the show.

Jimmy: Oh.

To thank me again.
And it was so nice.

And I don't know.
I got nervous talking to him on

the phone for some reason.
And I tried to be funny.

And I hear him say to his
assistant as I'm trying to do

this.
He goes, "oh, god, I'm stuck in

the middle of a bit with Zach
galifianakis."

[ Laughter ]

And I could tell he was trying
to get off the phone.

And I hung up on him.
I go, okay, I'll just call you

tomorrow. And I hung up.

[ Laughter ]

Knowing I'll never talk to him
again.

Jimmy: It was fun watching
you guys talk.

I know you said it was
uncomfortable for you.

But it was a lot of fun.
I wished it was longer.

It went right by for me.

It was too long.
Way, way too long.

Jimmy: It was not too long.
You've been a guest â€â€ how many

times have you been here, would
you guess? Do you have any idea?

How many times have I â€â€

Jimmy: Been on this show.

Oh, man.
I've had so many projects over

the years.

[ Laughter ]

Jimmy: You want to know the
answer?

Yes.

Jimmy: You've been a guest on
this show 167 times.

No, I just made that up.

[ Laughter ]

20?

Jimmy: More than that.
Definitely.

21.

Jimmy: Because there was a
time â€â€ it's not an auction.

There was a time that we had
weird combinations of guests.

And I was going through some old
photographs, and I found one.

I sent this to you.

You did.

Jimmy: That is â€â€ it might be
my favorite photograph from the

whole run of the show.

This is one of those show
business things.

I don't put anything up in my
house or any of that.

I don't like to be reminded of
what business I'm in.

But this is â€â€

Jimmy: So this is from 2003.
And you can see that â€â€ there's

Zach.
Wearing the same jeans, by the

way.

[ Laughter ]

Yep.

Those are the same â€â€

Jimmy: Yep, the same pair.

I had no â€â€

Jimmy: This is o. J.'S
attorney, Johnny Cochran.

There's me. And this is alf.
Who was there that night also.

Yeah.

Jimmy: And this was not when
alf was popular, by the way.

Nor me.

Jimmy: This is a solid 18
years after alf was popular.

Do you remember anything about
that night?

All I remember, and I don't
want to be vulgar because Nancy

pelosi's here, and I'm being
serious.

I told alf that night to f off.

[ Laughter ]

Not on air.
Just like behind the scenes.

Jimmy: And he did.

Yeah. I love alf.
I've always loved alf.

Jimmy: Same here.
I love alf.

I feel like alf was very
underrated.

Very underrated.

Jimmy: Why did you curse him
then?

And I just always â€â€ since I was
a child I've always wanted to

say "[ Bleep ] off, alf."

[ Laughter ]

Jimmy: Zach galifianakis is
here.

We'll be right back after this.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Dicky: Portions of â€œJimmy
Kimmel liveâ€ are brought to you

by applebee's new loaded fajitas.
Now that's eatin' good in the

neighborhood.

Nice to see you.

What condition â€â€

do you have â€â€

he's always doing these kinds
of â€â€

hey, Ken, do you have a car I
can borrow?

I don't think he's fit to
drive.

It's always something with
him. Money, car. Keys.

Mom, a friend is relying on
me. Can I borrow your car?

No.

Why?

Well, at least let me put
something on this. Or a salve.

I don't want your salves on
my face.

Jimmy: That is Zach
galifianakis and Louis Anderson

in "baskets" which returns to fx
two weeks from tonight, Thursday

June 13th.
I love Louie Anderson on this

show.
And you know I love the show.

You play two characters on the
show.

I do, yes.

Jimmy: Brothers.
Twin brothers. Chip and Dale.

Yes.

[ Laughter ]

Jimmy: Chip and Dale baskets.

I never even thought about
that. But yeah, that's right.

Chip and Dale.

Jimmy: I think it was last
season you had a big â€â€ was it

the big fight season last season?

No, that was a couple seasons
ago.

Jimmy: The fight scene that
went on and on and on.

When you do these scenes where
you're playing two characters at

once you have a body double,
right?

Well, sometimes at work there
will be three or four guys that

look like me and are dressed
like me and I'm like well, there

are four guys that are never
going to get laid.

[ Laughter ]

It gets a little confusing on
set. But yeah.

Jimmy: Does it?
It's confusing.

Which one am I?

[ Laughter ]

But it's weird because there are
so many people that look like

you on set.

Jimmy: I read a whole article
on the ringer, which is a

website, about one of your body
doubles.

And this guy's name is â€â€ do you
know his name?

That is Dylan.

Jimmy: That's Dylan peticord
is his name.

Yes.
He's going thrilled this is

happening.

Jimmy: Because normally you
just get to see the back of his

head.
This is the first time anyone's

seen his face.

I see it all the time.

[ Laughter ]

Jimmy: He plays your back.

[ Applause ]

He has your back, and he â€â€ he's
like back galifianakis.

Yeah.
He's back galifianakis, yes.

[ Rim shot ]

Jimmy: Where would one get a
body double? Like are they â€â€

well, for me they had to go

to a lot of modeling agencies.

[ Laughter ]

In all seriousness, there's a
Bruce vilanch lookâ€alike camp.

Jimmy: Oh, is that right?
It's a cam, a summer â€â€

I don't know.
I think they look for people

that look like you.
When those guys find out they

look like me they're bummed.
But then they come to work.

It's fun. It's a lot of fun.

Jimmy: All right.
Well, I look forward to the show.

I enjoy seeing you.
Is everything all right?

Are you all right?

Yeah, are we done?

Jimmy: Almost.
I mean, we still have â€â€ we're

going to do a commercial, and
then Nancy pelosi will be out.

I'm sticking around for Nancy
pelosi.

Jimmy: Stick around.
You're welcome to stick around.

No, behind â€â€ I'm not going
to stay here.

I wouldn't ruin the interview.
I'm going to go watch

respectfully. I love her.

Jimmy: Okay. Excellent.
Zach galifianakis, everybody.

"Baskets," fx Thursday June 13th
at 10:00 p. M.

We'll be right back with speaker
Nancy pelosi.

â™ª Gonna tell aunt Mary about

uncle John â™ª

Jimmy: Alessia Cara is on the
way. Our next guest is the

highestâ€ranking woman ever
elected in the United States.

She is a warrior from the golden
state.

Please welcome the speaker of
the house Nancy pelosi.

â™ª

[ Cheers and applause ]

How are you?
Thank you for coming.

My pleasure.

Jimmy: How are things groing
in Washington?

Anything interesting happening?

I'm really happy to be here.

[ Laughter ]

[ Cheers and applause ]

Jimmy: Do you feel a sense of
relief when you come back home

to California?

Well, it's always â€â€ this is
heaven on earth.

You know, we're very proud in
California.

Jimmy: It's the best state.
It is.

It's fabulous.
And tonight the golden state

warriors are â€â€

Jimmy: Yeah, right.
You're from that area.

That's your district.
Do you watch the games?

Always.

Jimmy: You do.

I watch all the games because
I want to size up what's coming

next from the other teams.

Jimmy: Who's your favorite
player on the warriors?

Oh, you you don't think I wo
say that.

[ Laughter ]

Jimmy: Oh, really? Okay.

They're all wonderful.
I do have a draymond green â€â€

one of his shirts signed.
You know, I won it at an auction.

Because every team needs
somebody like that.

Jimmy: Is it one of his dress
shirts or is it a Jersey?

It's a Jersey.

Jimmy: Yesterday Robert
Mueller finally spoke.

And he â€â€ he stepped down, he
made a statement, and he said â€â€

I wrote it down here.
He said, "if we had confidence

that the president clearly did
not commit a crime, we would

have said so."
So he didn't say so.

And then he indicated that now
it's congress's job to take it

from here.

That's right.

Jimmy: Are you taking it from
there?

Well, we've been on that path
for a while.

And when we do get to where
we're going, we're going to be

ready.

Jimmy: But it feels like
we've been on the path for a

really, really long while.

We really â€â€ well â€â€

Jimmy: Like since the '70s.

[ Laughter ]

You have to remember, we've
only had the majority, the

majority, the Democratic
majority. You got that?

Jimmy: That's true.

Since this year.
And the first month government

was shut down. You remember.

Jimmy: Right.

So we have â€â€ I'm very proud
of our chairman.

We had a big week last week.
We won three court cases and one

decision by the justice
department to give us documents.

We have to be ready.
It is â€â€ it's a very â€â€ our

founders, I always like to say
this, our founders in the

darkest days of the revolution
they said the times have found

us. Well, I think right now the
times have found us.

We have a defiance of the
constitution of the united

states.

[ Cheers and applause ]

And so when we go down this path
we have to be ready and it has

to be clear to the American
people and we have to hope that

it will be clear to the
Republicans in the United States

senate.

Jimmy: So are you saying that
you want to make sure

everybody's on board before you
would get into something like

impeachment?

No, no.
I'm not â€â€ well, we're on a path

to gain information.
The public deserves to know the

truth.

Jimmy: Yes.

The facts.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Jimmy: And yet â€â€

when you go down a path like
impeachment, which is very

divisive.
It could divide the country.

Jimmy: Sure.

But let's just put it this
way.

We understand our oath of office
to support and defend the

constitution of the united
states.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Apparently, the president does
not understand.

Jimmy: No, I think he
understands it.

He just doesn't love the
constitution that much.

Well, he doesn't honor the
oath to protect and defend.

So what we have to do, we know
our responsibility, but again,

because it is divisive we have
to try to bring people together.

E pluribus unum.
I quote our founders again.

From many one.
They couldn't imagine how many

we would be or how different we
would be from each other, but

they knew we had to try in what
we did to unify and not divide.

So let me just say this
immodestly.

I probably have a better idea as
to what the president has to be

held accountable for than anyone.

Jimmy: Have you read the
Mueller report?

Yes, I have.

Jimmy: Even the blackedâ€out
parts?

No.
We're calling for that.

They would show it to me.
But I said I'm not going to let

you show it to me unless you
show it to the whole country.

Jimmy: Oh, interesting.
I would want to see it.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Will they show it to me?

The only person who knows
better than I why this president

is not above the law, why this
president must be held

accountable, the only person who
knows better than I do is the

president of the United States.
He knows.

He knows what his violations
have been.

Jimmy: I don't think he even
knows.

[ Laughter ]

Well, he may not care.
But I think he knows.

Jimmy: I think sometimes they
do things and they go oh, that's

not allowed?
And then they kind of go back

and try to figure out what it
was and how they can keep it

quiet.

You know what really bugs me
about that?

Because when you see what they
say oh, I didn't know, I didn't

know it was wrong to talk to
Russians about this, I didn't

know, I say why don't â€â€ how do
you explain that to kids in the

hood?
When they're approached by law

enforcement and they say well, I
didn't realize that I was

supposed to do this or that.
Well, they're supposed to know.

But these very wealthy people
with highâ€priced lawyers can get

away with saying I didn't know
it was wrong â€â€

Jimmy: That's why we need you
to get in there and to take care

of this and do something to
these guys.

[ Applause ]

Here's what drives me crazy.
Because I believe, honestly, I

believe that â€â€ I â€â€ you know, I
know it may sound disingenuous,

but I hope the president didn't
do anything.

I hope that when we look through
the Mueller report it is what he

says it is.
We don't want that in the united

states.

Exactly.

Jimmy: But you know, we
don't â€â€ we haven't had a chance

to see the Mueller report.
It doesn't seem like â€â€ it seems

like when you subpoena somebody
in congress they â€â€ for?

Reason it used to be it seemed
like you got subpoenaed by

congress you had to go in and
speak.

Now it's like I don't know if
I'm going to do that, if I do I

have?
Different terms â€â€ can't you put

those people in jail if they say
they're not going to â€â€

well, you can fine them.
And you could â€â€ let me just,

because you mentioned several
things.

Jimmy: Yes.

Why I think the president
wants us to impeach him â€â€

Jimmy: You think he wants us
to impeach him?

Well, he knows it's not a
good idea to be impeached.

But the silver lining for him is
then he believes that he would

be exonerated by the united
states senate.

Jimmy: I see.

And there is a school of
thought that says if the senate

acquits you why bring charges
against him in the private

sector when he's no longer
president?

So when we go through with our
case, it's got to be ironclad.

Ironclad.

Jimmy: So because the senate
leans republican you â€â€

no, not leans.
Completely in the pocket of

Donald Trump republican.

Jimmy: Right.
And you think those republican

senators, even if they know he
committed a crime, will side

with Donald Trump?

They have been every day.
Not one of them has spoken up.

But in any case, here's the
thing. Just as you've said.

We would hope the best for our
country.

This is a country whose heart is
full of love.

The American people are so good.
We have our differences.

We have to be respectful of that.
And again, try to unify, not

divide in what we do.
But I do think the â€â€ when we

make â€â€ as we go down this path,
the American people will know

the truth and the president will
be held accountable.

But you have to go down that
path when you're as ready as you

can possibly be.
And you don't know that until

you go down the path.

Jimmy: Will we be ready
before the year 2020?

Yeah.

Jimmy: We will be ready?
Okay. The speaker of the house is

here.
We're going to take a break.

We'll be right back with Nancy
pelosi.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Jimmy: We're back.
Speaker of the house snansy

pelosi is here.
You know, we're talking about

bringing people together, and I
don't know that that's possible.

And I'll give you a reins why I
don't know if it's possible.

These opinion polls, if they are
to be believed, you know, we

feel like we're so divided right
now.

But let's put the opinion polls
up on the wall.

These are on various subjects.
Okay. Option of medicare for all.

74% of Americans favor that.
Coverage for preâ€existing

conditions. 75% in favor.
Oppose a wall. 58%.

Stricter gun laws, 67%.
Universal background checks, 97%.

[ Applause ]

Action on climate change, 66%.
Abortion should be legal in most

or all cases, 58%. And yet â€â€

[ cheers and applause ]

I mean, that's all well and good.
But unfortunately, does it come

down to party identification
more than anything?

Because it would seem that if,
for instance, there's a subject

that 97% of Americans agree on
that everyone would come

together and support that.

Well, let me just say
elections have ramifications and

we have passed many of those
proposals in the house of

representatives in the last
three or four months since we've

been there.
Gun safety legislation, violence

against women act.
We're always protecting the

preâ€existing condition.
And thank you so much for your

making it so well known, what
was at stake in â€â€

[ cheers and applause ]

Jimmy: To me there's not
even â€â€ I just don't understand

anyone who feels differently.
I just think that if your

neighbor was in that situation
you'd say yes, of course we

shouldn't preclude this person
from health care coverage

because they have something they
have no control over.

But what really frustrates me
more than anything is that more

people who represent us don't
stand up and say that's true and

you know what, I'm going to go
with it because it's true.

Well, let me just say on
health care â€â€ and how is Billy?

Jimmy: He's doing great,
thank you.

We all pray for him.

Jimmy: Thank you.

We were able to fight off the
attempts by the Republicans in

the last â€â€ you're not supposed
to use the republican word.

By the others who opposed health
care. The Republicans.

[ Laughter ]

They had like 60â€some attempts
to abolish the affordable care

act or pieces of it.
Really going after the

preâ€existing condition benefit,
which is really in my view

sinful. And the reason we were
successful was not because of us

inside outmaneuvering.
It was the outside mobilization.

For example, we passed the gun
violence protection bill to â€â€

just for background checks.
A modest bill, passed

overwhelmingly, has overwhelming
support. As you indicated.

In the public.
In the senate they've said we're

going to Bury it, we're the grim
reaper, we're going to Bury it

in the graveyard of the senate.
When we're depending on what

Abraham Lincoln said.
Public sentiment is everything.

With it you can accomplish
almost anything, without it

practically nothing.

Jimmy: Do you feel
handicapped by the fact that the

president doesn't pay any regard
to what is true?

That he just says whatever he
wants to say and the people who

support him believe him even
though reasonable impartial

sources look at his
statements â€â€ I mean, he lied

four times in one tweet today.
How do you combat that?

Well, I think the American
people are on to him.

Jimmy: Oh, no, they're not.

[ Laughter ]

His 39 percenters, or let's
give him 40%.

For some reason he connects with
them.

But overwhelmingly the country
is on to him.

Myself, I'm done with him in
terms of talking about him.

What we want to talk about is
let's build the infrastructure

of America and not have him
stomp out of the room.

[ Cheers and applause ]

Let's have affordable â€â€ we had
for the people our agenda when

we ran, for the people, lower
health care costs by lowering

the cost of prescription drugs
and saving the preâ€existing

condition benefit.
Lower health care costs.

Bigger paychecks by building
infrastructure of America in a

green way to preserve the
planet, to â€â€

Jimmy: It would be nice if we
could preserve the planet

because a lot of us live here on
it.

[ Laughter ]

And there's no plan b.
The first two I think he has

expressed an interest with
working with us on it.

Jimmy: Infrastructure.

We'll see.
The third I'm not sure he's

tyranted. Cleaner government.
Lower health care, bigger

paychecks, cleaner government to
reduce the role of big dark

money, special interest money in
politics.

For example, that is harming our
ability to get gun safety

legislation passed.
That is harming our ability to

get the other side
to support our climate action

now legislation to save the
planet. The list goes on and on.

So it is important to note the
importance of reducing the role

of money to getting better â€â€

Jimmy: Can I make one
suggestion?

The next time you go into a
meeting, a negotiation with him.

All right.

Jimmy: Bring McNuggets.

[ Laughter ]

It's not going to hurt.
Thank you for being here.

Good luck.
Speaker of the house Nancy

pelosi, everyone.
We'll be right back with alessia

Cara.

live" concert series is

Dicky: The "Jimmy Kimmel
