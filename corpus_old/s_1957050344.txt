What is this place?

Our new home.

David, don't run.

Hey, kids.
Yes?

Let's go in

Don't be like that.
Come inside.

This isn't what you promised.

Grab onto this and step here.

It just gets worse and worse.

Want to see something
even better?

Stop it!

How far is the hatchery
from here?

Come here.

Look.

Take a look at this.

Look at the dirt.

Look at the color.

This is why picked this place.

Because of the dirt color?

This is the best dirt
in America.

Daddy's going to make
a big garden!

David, don't run!

Where should Grandma's picture go?

We're not staying long.
Leave it in the box.

Yeah.

One or two readings are okay.

But we'll keep checking.

We'll move closer to
a hospital.

Let's sleep together on the floor
for our first night

No, Dad! You snore!

I want to listen too.

You do?

Put these in your ears.

Don't forget to keep praying.

.Hello.

Oh! Hello.

There are Koreans here

A few of us.

I've never seen anyone
as fast as Mr. Yi.

Must've made good money
in California.

He did.

But wasn't fast enough
to work there.

How long have you been working?

About six months.

In any case,
you're fast enough for here.

You came to the right place.

Go to your sister.

Go to your sister.

Let's go.

Daddy can take a break.

David, don't run.

What's that?

That?

Male chicks are discarded there.

What is "discarded"?

That's a difficult word, huh?

Male chicks don't taste good.

They can't lay eggs
and have no use.

So, you and I should try
to be useful.

Okay?

Come here.

Sit down.

Son.

How do you like our farm?

How was our land in California?

-We had nothing.
That's right.

We had nothing.

But now...

Ve have this big piece of land.

Isn't that good?

Then tell Mommy you really like it.

Okay?

Let's go inside.

The Koreans live in Rogers
near three other big towns.

If we move there we could find a
Korean grandma to babysit

There's a big mall, a good school,
and people actually live there.

But what about the deal
we made?

You can work here
and I can build a garden.

You can get five acres in Rogers.

Five acres is a hobby.

But my dream is fifty acres.

That land is your dream?

Anyway, we don't need a babysitter

There's no one around.
What could happen?

But what if something
happens to him?

The hospital is an hour away

That's strange. The sky is green.

The car is ready.

We'll assess the situation
before we escape.

Escape? Why?

If the tornado hits,
this house will fly away

Stop staring. Go to the car.

We need to wait here
and watch.

Watch what?

The news is tracking the tornado.

Look.

Mom!

See?

It'satornado watch,
not a "warning."

We worried for no reason.

Are you crazy?

Who's calling who crazy?

For you, for our kids!

For our kids?
Oh, come on!

worked for ten years

Ten years!

Staring at chicken butts all day.

Working myself to the bone!

Living in a tiny home
with no money!

And where did that money go?

-Don't start again.
Start what?

How much money went to the kids?

I'm the eldest son.
had to take care of my family.

I'm done now.
They're all doing well!

Who's doing well?
My mother? Us?

Which family are you even
.talking about?

Enough!

We said we wanted a new start.

This is it.

If this is the "start"you wanted...

Maybe there's no chance for us.

You're up already?

Mom, Anne said we have to move.

Is that true?

Would you live in a house like this
when you're married?

I'm going to live here
till the day die.

But are we really moving?

Dad and I talked last night.
We're not moving.

Grandma will come to live
with us instead.

Mommy's mom?

Yes.

She'll finally meet David.

Isn't that nice?

Yes.

I'll be outside.

Okay.

We should get this place ready.
David, eat up.

I'll help you.

Americans...

Believing that nonsense!

Korean people use their heads

Hey, come here.

Come.

Look.

When it rains...

That's right.

Where is the low place?

That's right.

Where else?

Then which place has
lots of water?

My clever little boy!

Never pay for anything
you can find for free.

But for our farm,

we can get free water
from the land.

That's how we use our minds

Got it?

Anne, stay here.

Mom.

Do we have to burn all our
trash from now on?

Yes. Isn't the city better?

Did we use that stupid stick?
How did we find this?

We used our minds!

We used our minds!

More! More!

So scary

You like them?
Yes.

Not too big?

They're good.

David, introduce yourself

Mom! Have you looked outside?

How much was it?

It's an investment.

Don't worry.
We'll earn it all back.

This is how you farm in America.

Why are you laughing?

So, it's not a garden.
It's farm.

Garden, farm, it's all the same.

Just think of it as growing money.

In three years,
we can quit chicken sexing.

Just leave enough for David

That's all I'm asking.

You look happy.

Maybe because Mother is coming?

You look prettiest
when you re happy.

Isn't it better to grow
American vegetables?

Every year, thirty thousand Koreans
immigrate to the US.

Wouldn't' they miss Korean food?
Yes!

Then how would a Korean farm
like ours do?

-Pretty well, right?
Yes

You're shy?

Why don't you want
Grandma to come?

It's not earwax, it's dirt.

Mommy's dad died during the war.

You know what that means, right?

That's why Mommy has no
brothers or sisters.

Understand?

Ne're the only family
Grandma has.

Can't she come live with us?

Don't touch that. Answer me.

You fight because of Grandma.

If Grandma comes...

Would Mommy and Daddy fight?

Wow!
My kids are so good-looking!

Stand closer together.

Good!

One, two... Cheese!

Grandma's here.

So good-looking!

Grandma's here.

Hello, Grandma!

Is this Anne?
Already such lady!

David, say hello to Grandma.

What is this?

Hiding behind your mommy's skirt?

Come on out
It's embarrassing.

Mom.

You're finally here.

You missed me that much?

I really missed you too.

Must've been hard for you
to travel so far.

Here.

Chili powder!

Oh my...

It's so hard to get here.

We even drove eight hours
to Dallas.

And it wasn't very good.

You brought anchovies too?

You're crying again?

Because of anchovies?

I'm sorry you have to see
how our life is now

Why?
Because the house has wheels?

It's fun!

Hold on.

Also...

This...

This is something from me,
so take it.

No, Mom. I can't

Take it!

No, Mom. No!

should be giving you money

I'm working now!

Just put it away.

Is he ever going to greet
Grandma?

Is this the one who
looks like me?

Are you curious?

Nhat?

Say it louder.

She doesn't look like a grandma?

Oh! Really?

What a good boy!

I'll give you a present
for that compliment!

Let's see.

Here.

You're giving cards to
a seven-year-old?

Start him young to beat
those other bastards!

No?

Then I'll give you something else!

It's a chestnut!

Looks yummy!
Go on and take it.

He's never eaten this before.

Really?

Wait one second.

You don't have to do that for him.

In case it got stale during
the plane ride.

Here, eat it!

Take it, David.

Take it. Take it.
Eat it. Eat it

Take it
-that' 's good boy. Eat it.

Say, "Thank you.

heard American kids don't like
sharing their rooms.

He's not like that.
He's a Korean kid.

No. No need.

-What' s in it?
Anything good for you.

It has everything,
even deer antlers.

You must've spent a lot.

David, you're so lucky!

Is this enough?
That's good, that's good.

That's good.

Here.

Try some.
don't want it.

Drink it
Grandma brought it from Korea.

That's it!

don't want it.
It's expensive. Drink it all

Good! Such a good boy!

Grandma...

In the future,
never, ever bring this again.

You'll drink one cup every day.

Good job.

Hey.

What?
â€œGrandma smells?

Go get the stick.

No?

Then behave in front of Grandma.

Now go to bed.

Go to bed.

What are you making?

Pasta.

Looks tasty.
Can Grandma try some?

What's that?

It's water from the mountains.

Dad says it's good for
your health.

Then I'll try some.

Grandma?

Yes?

You can't cook?

No, can't.

Can you bake cookies?

No.

Can you bake them?

Then what can you do?

Sucks for you!

Now they're mine!

Out of my way,
you bastard!

Watch and learn.

Damn it.

Vait.

That's right!

Now, Anne!

Keep playing, keep playing!

Hurry!

A plague on you!

Damn it

Okay, wait.

Let's see

Bastard!

Why hasn't anyone started
Korean church here?

Start a church with
fifteen Koreans?

It could be nice.
The Korean kids can play together.

The Koreans around here...

Left the cities for a reason.

To escape Korean church.

We shouldn't be so far
out here.

It's fine!
Just a little further.

This would be a great place

Grandma.

We shouldn't be here
because of the snakes.

Do you even know
what minari is?

You stupid Americans.

I brought some minari seeds
from Korea.

We can plant them
right over there.

The minari will grow well here.

Grandma, stop it!

Fine.

That looks tasty.
Eat, David.

You too, Anne.

We should plant some minari.

It'll grow well
down by the creek.

I'll think about it.

What's there to-think about?
I'll just plant it.

Mom, try some of this.

Hey, David.
Bring that mountain water.

That's it.

You two used to love this song.

This song

Sure!

Whenever someone made
your mom and dad sing,

they'd get all lovey-dovey
as they sang this song.

Did we?

They come to America and
forget everything.

love you, darling.

Truly, love you.

Truly...

ove you.

David, let's pray.

Mommy heard a story about
some kids in Korea...

They prayed to see Heaven
before bedtime.

And God heard their prayers.

One kid had a weak heart
like you.

When he woke up,
he was healed!

Why don't you pray to
see Heaven too?

You pray, Mommy.
You go and see Heaven.

Mommy can't do it.

Hey!

You make this kid do
all sorts of crap!

You scared me!

Okay.

Monica.

Practicing on them is pointless.
They're too old.

You're fast enough for Arkansas.

Don n't' talk to me if youre'
not going to help.

You must be lonely here
without friends.

Even with Mother here,
it's not the same thing.

Why are you saying this,
all of a sudden?

thought we might
go to church.

Don't hide it, okay?

Something must be broken
down there.

What is his thing called
in English?

â€œPenis

Mommy...

Sometimes, I dream
I'm peeing in the bathroom,

but I wake up in my bed.

Then ask yourself
before you pee,

And pinch yourself like this!

Mom!

Mom.

There's another one.

So fat!
That man is so fat!

Look at him!

Can sleep over at his house?

You should sleep at home,
with Grandma.

Don't say that.

Let's just work on Sundays.

Then why did you give
so much money?

Is that Paul?

What?

You like Jesus too.

Look at those muscles!

Ay, my
That's impressive.

Grandma,
you're not a real grandma.

What is a real grandma?

They bake cookies!
They don't swear!

They don't wear men's underwear!

Really?

Don't do that!

Go get some mountain water.
Let's drink that.

NO.

Come here.

Oh, my!

He's hitting him again.
And again!

Someone could get killed!

You little bastard!

Come back here,
you little bastard!

Raise your hands!

Keep them apart.

Come on!

Keep them up!

Raise them straight.

That's enough.

Now apologize to Grandma.

Sorry...

You call that an apology?

Do it properly!

She's not even a real grandma...

It's okay, it's okay!

Just don't do it again, okay?

I'll try to be a real grandma
from now on.

Go get the stick.

Why would you hit him?

Get the stick.

Why would you hit such a
sweet boy?

He's only a child!

Who cares if I drank
a little pee?

It was fun!

Mom!

Go outside and get a new one.

I'll do better. I'll do better.

Mom, it's bad enough you're
in this hillbilly place.

Why "hillbilly" place?

It's hillbilly,
so David lost all his manners.

Just because you're from the city
doesn't make you better.

You two will fight over anything!

Let's see.

My, my!

Such clever boy.

Good job.

You won.

You're the real winner!

Monica.

Will you help me?

must've' worked too hard.
Does it hurt lot?

I can't raise my arms
any higher.

need to wash my hair...

Working outdoors makes me
feel alive.

Why do you always pinch me
like that?

Ne're losing so much money.

I'm worried.

Everything will be fine.

I'll take care of us.

Coming to this "hillbilly place"
was for our family.

And if the farm fails...

You can do what you want.

You could even leave
with the kids.

Lean forward.

Hello, sir.

Yes, the order is ready.
We'll send it this weekend.

But we've already started...

All right.

Finished already?

Someone could get killed.

My, my...

Grandma,
please help him change.

Who cares
what a little boy wears?

Grandma,
the water isn't working.

Your arms still hurt?
-I'm fine.

Just leave it.

If they're injured,
we throw them away.

Anne! Grandma!

Anne! Grandma!

What is it?

My goodness!

Hurry! Get towel!

Anne, snap out of it!
Get a towel!

The church bus is here.

You go ahead, without David.

There we go.

Which drawer attacked you?

You lifted that heavy thing?

And you put it back,
all by yourself?

Goodness.

Okay. Try standing up.

There you go.

Good.

Now, try walking.

Oh, my

What?

No one's ever said that to you?

David.

You're strong boy.

You're the strongest boy
Grandma's ever seen!

Grandma.

What does pee taste like?

You rascal!

The weather is nice.

Grandma!
You can walk faster like this!

I can?

Goodness.
You might as well run.

You do that
because you shouldn't run?

You want to run, don't you?

Why don't we try running
to that tree together?

don't think can.

It's okay, it's okay.

Let's just go.

Slowly.

Let's go slowly

Careful. Careful.

The minari is growing well?

David, you ve never eaten
minari before, huh?

Minari is truly the best.

It grows anywhere, like weeds.

So anyone can pick and eat it.

Rich or poor
anyone can enjoy it and be healthy

Minari can be put in kimchi
put in stew, put in soup.

It can be medicine
if you are sick..

Minari is wonderful, wonderful!

That's right!

Is that a minari song?

The wind is blowing and
the minari is bowing.

They're saying
thank you very much!

Grandma!
Look at that

Stop, David!
Leave it alone!

It might crawl away and hide!

David.

It's better to see it
than to have it hide.

Things that hide are more
dangerous and scary.

There's' been no water all day?

should check the pipes.

He thinks I don't know.

We can't afford more water.
He used it all on the crops.

What are we going to do?

I'm sure we'll borrow more
from the bank.

Daddy, where are you going?

No.

Go inside.

Mom.

I'll take care of our family.

Don't work too hard.

So, where did you get
all that water?

David and I hauled it over
from the minari creek.

David is stronger than you think,
you know.

He's not supposed.
to do things like that.

You remember Cousin-doo-won?
That big, dumb kid.

At David's age,
he was much weaker.

You don't understand, Mom.

Getting hurt is
all part of growing up.

Even the doctors are worried.

His heart could stop
at any moment.

What are you doing?

Why aren't you sleeping?
What's wrong?

Mommy said if pray,
I can see Heaven in my sleep.

Like those kids who prayed
to see Heaven?

Are you scared?

It's all right.
You don't have to go see Heaven.

Saying such nonsense to a kid.

But... I already prayed.

I already asked to see it.

But now, I don't want to go.

Then David...

Pray this instead.

"No thank you... Heaven.

But what if I go to Hell?

Why are you worrying about
that already?

I don't want to die.

Come here, David.

Grandma won't...

Grandma won't let you die.

Who?

Who dares to scare
my grandson like this?

Don't worry.

Grandma won't let you die.

Who dares?

You'll be fine.

You don't have to see Heaven.

Grandma.

Grandma?

Grandma!

Grandma,
why did you wet the bed?

Mom took grandma
to the hospital.

Vas church good?

Y
es.

There's' no water?
-ENot yet.

That's not good...

can get more from
the minari creek

Stay with your friends tonight,
but be careful.

We will.

Out of my way,
you bastard!

Grandma...

What are you looking at,
Grandma?

Leave it...

It will hide....will hide.

Anne, come over here.

What's wrong with Grandma?

Grandma had a stroke.
She needs to rest

Why did it happen?

It's my fault.

This happened because
was selfish.

Grandma wil be okay,Mom.

My daughter's so grown-up.
Worrying about her mom

Always looking after
her brother, too.

I'm sorry.

I won't let this happen again.

David, help Grandma.

told you to help grandma.

Here, Mom.

For... David...
Him...him.

You said he was strange,
now you ask him to do this?

When did I say that?

He wanted to help us.
We should be grateful.

What did you tell him about us

Why would I tell him anything?

It's your fault, Grandma.

It's all because of you.

You shouldn't have come
to America.

Mom, look over here.

There's food in the fridge.
No need to heat it up, okay?

It's okay.
You don't have to help.

Watch TV and rest
Ne'll be home late.

Don't worry

Thank you so much, Mom.

We'll be back.

You're bringing that inside?

It's too hot out here.

Where will you put it?

Okay.

I'll park downstairs.
Go ahead.

Ve're here for David.

Okay. Go on in.

Is he okay?

We don't know.

The doctor will tell us.

Here we go. Good job!

Life was so difficult in Korea

Remember what we said
when we got married?

That we'd go to America
and save each other.

remember.

Instead of saving each other...

All we did- was fight.
Is that why he's sick?

Jacob.

Can't you come with us?

can't do this without you.

You're the one who
Wants to leave.

We'll go broke living here.

In California, we could easily
pay off our debt.

By chicken sexing until we die.

Think about the kids.

They need to see me
succeed at something for once.

For what?

Isn't it more important that
we stay together?

You go ahead
\and do what you want.

Even if fail,
I have to finish what started.

Kids. Let's go.

Good job!

Good!

Look, it's kimbap!

Beans?

-Anne,don' 't touch it
Okay

It's a very good idea.

Many Koreans are moving to
Oklahoma City.

Yes, and most of your produce
comes from California.

It arrives in worse shape
and doesn't taste as good.

We're only five hours away.

Very good.

Then...

When should we start?

Let's start next week.

Thank you.

Please keep these as samples.

Thank you very much!

Thank you!

Have a good day.

Did you see?

They have so many
Korean foods.

This is such perfect timing.

The owner said so himself

Mom must be in shock.
She's speechless.

Anne, take David to the car.

Monica.

Monica.

What is it?

You're really asking
because you don't know?

At the hospital...

You chose the farm
over our family.

It's different now.

Everything worked out.

We can live together when
things are good,

but when they're not,
we fall apart?

Let's just stop, okay?

Now, we can make money
and live without worries.

So, you're saying...

We can't save each other,
but money can?

But Jacob...

Things might be fine now.

But I don't think they will
stay that way.

I know this won't end well
and can't bear it.

I've lost my faith in you.

can't do this anymore.

Okay

It's done.

You haven't left yet?

We're heading out now.

I'll see you next week.

What's that smell?

It smells like smoke.

Jacob...

Stay in the car!

Stay in the car!

Jacob!

Grandma!
Grandma!

Mom, are you okay?

What happened?

Mom!

Jacob!

Mom!

Jacob!

Honey!

Get out!
Get out of here!

Mom!

Dad!

Dad!

Dad!

Grandma!

You stay here, okay?

Grandma!

Honey

Honey

Honey

Grandma!

Grandma, where are you going?

Grandma!
Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma!

Grandma, this is the wrong way

Grandma.

Our house is back there.

Grandma!

Please don't leave, Grandma.

Come home with us.

It's growing well on its own.

Grandma picked a good spot.

Looks tasty.
