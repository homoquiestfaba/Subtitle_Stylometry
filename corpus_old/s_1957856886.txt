Woman: I'm sorry,
what was the question?

Year-end taxes. Right.

Well, a lot of my clients
are small business owners.

So, you know, work is always
going to be crazy for me

around the holidays.

Regardless of whatever
else I have going on.

â™ª

Okay, Jay. Come on!

Okay, you want a treat?

Good boy. Okay.


â™ª


Luckily, I'm a multitasker.

Yeah, I mean, to be this busy
at Christmas time is not ideal,

but I feel really
lucky to have the work.

So, I have to stay flexible.

When it comes to social
plans especially,

those have to come second.

â™ª

I love you so much.

I love you, too.

And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.


Oh, no!

Cut!

â™ª


I just think that you
need to be very clear

and realistic about what
you can accomplish in a day.

(phone pinging)

So there are no disappointments.

Um...
(phone pinging repeatedly)

So, um, things don't get...

out of hand. (chuckling)

You can deduct the dinner,
just not the birthday party.

Okay.

Okay. Hey!

â™ª

Ah...

Now, I can direct, but
I can't always control.

Do you know what I mean?

Exactly why I'm the
right man for the job,

because it takes a special
soul, a creative soul,

to find emotion in 30
seconds. Taxi! Taxi!

You know, it's like...
It's like a little haiku.

It's like a thing... Uh, um...

Hold on. Hold on one second.

Hey, man...

When I figured that
out? Boom. Game-changer.

Come on!

No, no, no, no, no.
I'm good. Not you.

No, I was... I was just...

I was trying to catch a cab.

Okay. Now that we've established
what you've worked out,

let's discuss what you haven't.

I mean, we're pretty good.

Yeah, I'm good.

Yeah.


â™ª You're here, where
you should be â™ª

â™ª Snow is falling as
the carolers sing â™ª

â™ª Just wasn't the same

â™ª Alone on Christmas day

â™ª Presents, what a
beautiful sight â™ª

â™ª Don't need a thing if you
ain't holding me tight â™ª

Therapist: Okay, then.

Why don't we take a step back

and talk a little bit
more about the renovation?

Oh, well, that's all Robby.

Why do you say it like that?

'Cause it is.

Well, she gave me
complete creative control

over the entire renovation, so.

Because you remind me that
you're the creative one.

chime in whenever you want.

I did. About the microwave.


The microwave cannot be the
centerpiece of our kitchen.

I don't want it to
be the centerpiece,

I just have two things
that I really care about.

One, I do not want
an all-white kitchen.

Which is a non-issue.
Neither do I.

And two, I need to be able
to reach the microwave.

You cannot put a
microwave on an island.

It doesn't look good.

Okay, well you can't put it
on top of the cabinets either.

I need a ladder to cook!
Who's putting on the cabinets?

I'm not putting it
on the cabinets!

You don't even cook,
what do you care?

It's just beautifully
elevated, a little off-center.

You want it smack dab in...
You could just put little...

The middle of the kitchen.
Cabinets over a...

No one wants a microwave in
the middle of the kitchen!

Okay, time out.

Okay.


I think we all know this isn't
actually about the renovation.

No, it kind of is. Yeah.
No, no. Yeah, it really is.

Mm.

We were supposed to be done.

Today.
December 16th.

Workers out, on a plane to
Heathrow with our parents.

We keep hitting...
Making.

Obstacles for ourselves.
Yeah.

So, we just thought, "I
don't know, let them go off

and have a couple's
retreat without us.

To Europe?
Robby: Mm-hm.

Yeah. We insisted
that they still go.

Yeah, it's not their fault.

Yeah, and we can't be in another
continent five time zones away

when we're trying to finish.
We gotta finish the remodel.

Yeah.
We gotta finish.

Besides, they're super tight.
Mm-hm.

Well, that's nice that they've
given you some space to

work on all these issues.

Oh, yeah. They have no idea.

Yeah, this is just between us.

So, now we're stuck in our dusty
half-apartment for Christmas.

Both: Alone together.

Good!

Good?
Good? Why good?

Well, now we're finally
getting somewhere.

This isn't about microwaves,
it's not about renovations.

This is about feeling
alone together.

Can we all agree on that?

I just don't know if...

we work together anymore.

Has been...

13 years.

Maybe we've grown apart.

Maybe.

Or maybe you do just need to
get away for the holidays.

We just established that...
Uh, we just... Yeah.

I have an idea.

I know a couple
that just came back

from this charming,
somewhat, shall I say,

different nook of a town.

I think I have the article.

Ah. Yes.

Rebecca: Gracious, Vermont.

"All the goodness you need."

And only a few hours away.

Hm?

I mean, you know,

if anything goes wrong
with the remodel,

we can always just come
back to the city and...

Doesn't it look a tad bit too...

romantic?

Given where we are?

This is our first
Christmas together, yes?

Yeah.

Let's not do a second.

If you don't start connecting,

start getting on the
same page together,

it's only going to get worse.

And it could be fun!

It could go horribly wrong,

but probably it'll be fun.


Either way, if you
don't even try,

you won't have a
relationship to come home to.

â™ª


Hey, buddy. It's not
too long of a drive.

Just long enough, okay?

Why don't you go in the
back and take a nap?

Go. Go back. Go back.

Thank you.

(phone ringing)

Ah.

Hey, mom. How's London?

Oh, it's great. You
know, I just woke up

all fresh and ready for dinner.

I wish you guys
were here with us.

I know. Same. Did
you get my message?

About having to be out now?

Yeah, between the
dust and the fumes

and the extra crew that
Robby's bringing in to finish,

there's no room for us.

Well, I've never been to, um,

what's the name of that place?

Gracious, but, you know,
I'm so glad you guys

found a close getaway.

Hi, Judy.

Hey!

Uh, have fun tonight.
We love you guys.

You too, sweetheart.

And remember, I'm
expecting lots of photos.

Oh, it won't feel like
Christmas without seeing

your cheery faces every day.

Mm-hm.

Well, let's start now.

Oh, um. Okay.

Both: (half-heartedly) Yay.

Aww! How do I turn this off now?

Just the red button.

Bye, Judy. Love you guys.
The red button, mom.

Yeah. Okay.
Bye, Judy.

Oh, boy.

â™ª

GPS: You've arrived
at your destination.

I don't see it.

Do you see the inn anywhere?

No, but I do see a
whole lot of cheese.

Feel free to drop me off here.

What the...

(bleating)
heck?

Wow.

She wasn't kidding when she
said this place was different.

Mm.

GPS: Proceed to your
designated route.

There is no designated route.

You said we reached
our destination.

Robby, don't get mad at her.

I'm not mad, baby. I'm lost.

Well, the town
doesn't look that big.

Just keep going straight.

Look, there it is!

Where?

Right at the end of the block.

See?

Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

Whoa. Look at the size
of those ornaments.

Proceed to destination.

Pies for PETS at the
Christmas market?

I mean, who wouldn't
want to support that?

Who's that?

Kayla. Well, you
know I love to bake,

So, I am happy to help.

What are you doing?


Kayla, you volunteered to run
the whole Christmas market.

It doesn't matter that it's
just for one day, it's huge!

So, the least we can
do is bake a few pies.

It's Christmas.

You just let us know
how many you need. Okay.

We're baking how many pies?

Don't worry. She doesn't
need them until the 23rd.

'Tis the season
for doing, right?

Or taking on too much.

I'm sure she won't
need that many.

(barking)
Hi, buddy.

Hi!
Hi, welcome!

I see you've met Rosie girl.

Yeah, well Jerry certainly has.

You must be the Grays.

Uh, yeah, you could probably
find us under "Rebecca."

Great. I'm Vince, this
is my husband, Brian.

We are the owners here.

Hi, guys.
Hi.

Uh, oh. It says
here that you booked

a two bedroom suite
for eight nights.

Is that correct?

Uh, I don't know. Is it?

Uh, I just thought
it'd be nice to have

a little space, you know?
You do snore a little.

I do snore when I'm
laying on my back.

This one grinds her
teeth all night long.

I can always wear a night guard.

want to see that.

So, we're good with
the two bedrooms, then?

Yeah.
Perfect.

Great, and how did you...

How did you hear about us?

A friend.

(clearing throat)
Yup, a friend.

Great. Well, as
I'm sure you saw,

the town is just a
quick two-block walk,

and here are some pamphlets
for all the activities

leading up to Christmas.

Hey!
And since you're not

checking out until the 26th,

you're going to have a
chance to enjoy them all!

Wow, well, we... we will
definitely check these out.

Need help with your bags?

Uh, no. You know the old rule.

Just pack what you can carry.

Lucky number 13, just up
the stairs on the left.

Settle in. If you
have any questions,

just let us know.

I do have a question.
Could I get my own key?


Yup.

There you go.

Alright.
Welcome.

Thank you. Alright,
come on. Come on.

Bye-bye.
See you later.

They're going to
need a lot of work.

Okay, go ahead.



Here's your bags.

Thank you.

Well, it's cute.

Yeah.

â™ª

Seriously? Two bedrooms?

Look, I can go
downstairs and change it.

Is that what you want to do?

I don't know. What do you want?

It's fine. I want
to watch soccer.


Maybe there's a trick to it?

Would you like to see
if you could fix it?

Okay, maybe we can just forget
the English Premier League.

There's breakfast with
Santa at the syrup shop,

caroling, Christmas
market on the 23rd,

ooh, and a parade.

Why don't we do one of those?

There's a parade?

Yeah.

Sounds fun.


Peppermint pretzels.

Want one?
(phone ringing)

It's all you.

Come on. You're missing out.

(phone ringing)
It's Ron.

Who?
The electrician.

Ronny! Hey, brother.
What's the good news?

Ah, that's not good news.

â™ª

No, Ron, have you tried
the circuit breaker?

Okay, well, I don't know
if you can't do that.

What do you mean you
can't make it symmetrical?

That's the whole point
of the kitchen design

is that the outlets
are all symmetrical,

six inches apart, six
inches off the countertop.

Come on, Jerry.
Let's go for a walk.

Six inches from the
wall, six inches...

Come on.

When you and I sat
down together...

Good boy. Come.

And I said, "Why not?"

And I trusted you that
you could make it happen.

(barking)
Hey, Jerry. Slow down! Hey!

This is a two-block town.
We have plenty of time.

What are you... Oh, I see.
You're like a truffle hunter.

I don't know if we
can have those, boy,

'cause I think
it's for customers

and we're not going in.

As much as I need a...

portrait of an alpaca. Hm?

(doorbell jingling)

Hi. Someone wants a treat!


Hi, sorry. I hope that's okay.

Of course. It's what
they're here for.

Made fresh daily,
organic, natch.

Wow. Okay.

Welcome to Kayla's
Colorful Pet Portraits.

I am Kayla, and I
paint pet portraits.

And what's your name?
And where are you from?

I don't think I've
met you before,

because I would know you
if you were from town,

and who is this little cutie?

And how'd you get his
coat so darned shiny?

You're coming in, right?

Oh, you know I would love to,

but we are in a bit of a rush.

I have to meet someone.

Um...

Over there.

Oh, darn. But hey,
maybe next time.

Great. Okay, bye.

Bye. Bye. Bye.

(door closing)

And that is why the human leads.

So, there's really
no trick for the TV?

Not that I know of,

but people don't usually come
here to watch television.

Well, no, of course.

I'm not here to watch
television either,

I just, you know, like
it on in the background.

Mm-hm. Well, we have a
VCR player in your room,

and we have some movies.

Mostly romantic comedies.

Mm, okay. Um...

I will take that reservation.
What time is that for?

4:45 pm.


If you want to eat
tonight, it is.

Wow. Didn't know we
needed a reservation.

Reservation for what?

Ah, just the finest
restaurant in town. Here.

I think I read that.

Yeah, you're hungry right? Yeah?

I mean, a little.

Good, because we have a
reservation in 15 minutes.

For dinner?

Welcome to Gracious.


Okay.

I'll bring Jerry upstairs.

Okay, I'm going to
go get us a table.

Come on.

See you at dinner.

You ever get the feeling
you're being watched?

By a creepy elf?

Or several.

I do now.

Hey...

Hey.

So, what looks good?

Well, actually, while you
were putting Jerry away,

I took the liberty and
I ordered us dinner.

I saw they had a
Beef Wellington,

but then I saw they had
a porterhouse for two.

ordered me a steak?

Yeah.

Wait, really?
What?

Robby, I stopped eating
meat three months ago.

You did?

You knew that.

Oh, clearly I did not.

No, no. I told you.
When? While I was asleep?

For three months
you hadn't noticed?

You know what? Your
observation skills

haven't been on point either.

You didn't even notice that
I was gone for two days.

No, I noticed.

You noticed when I came home.

Well, you work late at night

and I'm gone early
in the morning.

I can't keep track
of your schedule.

Well, and I can't keep track
of your culinary preferences.

Look, you're right, oaky?

I just remember when we
used to want to know, like,

everything about each other.

(both laughing)

Robby, what are we doing?

We are trying to
have a lovely dinner.

Neither of us wants to be here.

Neither of us is happy.

Tell me, in your
heart, that I'm wrong.

What do you want to do?

Just feel like we've
tried everything.

Keeping busy and working

and the remodel and
marriage coaching.

Nothing seems to work.

So, what are you saying, Becca?

I'm saying I think we need
to take some time apart.

Just to think.

Kay.

Robby, we can't get through
dinner without arguing.

You're right. We should
try a separation.

I just don't want
it to get worse.

Do you want to go home?

Yeah?
Yeah.

Let's go home.
Yeah.

I've got a porcini,
Brussels sprout,

and chestnut amuse-bouche.

Compliments of the chef.

Oh, and your martinis
are on their way.

Robby: Thanks, Antonio.

At least we ordered drinks, too.

â™ª

Okay, look. I know
you hate suitcases.

We're just going home
a little bit early.

We'll figure things out
when we get there, okay?

Come on.

Robby?

Yeah?


What the...

You gotta be kidding me!


â™ª

Hi, thanks for coming.

Wow.

That ornament did some
impressive damage.

Yeah, that's
unusual word choice.

It's unfortunate, too.

Yeah, that's closer.

I always loved those ornaments.

That's what's unfortunate?

How long is it going to take
to replace the windshield?

We were hoping to leave today.

Oh, yeah. No. A few
days. Maybe a week.

A week? Why? Because
of the holiday?

That's just how long it takes,
but that's a good point.

That could add some days, yeah.

But, we can say "a few
days" for now, how's that?

That sounds good, yup.
Thank you.

I'm going to go
call in that order.

Thanks, Cindy.

It's crazy that you can't
get car service out here.

We should have left last night.

I don't know whether I
want to laugh or cry.

You know what? I'm going
to find another place

to stay for the week.

I mean, I think that'll
be less awkward, right?

I mean, that's silly.
We have plenty of rooms.

I have taken care of
checking you back in,

and the rest of
the week is on us.

Oh, seriously? You
don't need to do that.

But we will gladly
take it, thanks.

Thank you.

And at least you won't
miss the Sip 'n' Shop now.

Starts at 3:00.

It is one of our
favorite holiday events.

I mean, the front desk just
has to fend for itself.

Is it heavy on the sip?

Sip 'n' Shop it is.

Welcome back.

â™ª

Ideally, I'd love to have
full-sized pies for the adults,

and mini ones for the kids.

So, 100 total?

Each?

Why are we doing this again?

Every year we have the
same old Christmas market,

which is great, but
it's just shopping.

Pies for PETS adds
this whole other level.

Pets?
All caps, honey.

Pet Excellent Treatment Society.

Oh, sounds like a sweet charity.

Yeah, and Dave was
always kind of a Grinch.

So, just feels
good to give back.

Yeah, I never did love your ex.

Now, I've already got everyone
chipping in on ingredients.

I will send you the list,
and I'm doing pie tins.

Great.
Yeah.

Mm.

And what about me?
How can I help?

How would you feel
about bartending?

I'm thinking hot chocolate

and mulled wine to
go with the pies.

Vince: I know.

(Kayla chuckling)

Hey, don't worry. We
don't have to stay long.

Just one drink, and
buy a few things.

In and out. Just act normal.

Well, how else would I act?

You know what I mean.

Hi.

Hi!

We thought you might like these.

And I bet you're wondering what

all the hot ticket
items are around here.

So, follow us.

I know I'm wondering about
the hot ticket items.

This is really good.
Is it?

â™ª


I still feel terrible
about the windshield,

but at least you get
some extra time to relax.

Yeah, we're not
very good at that.

Well, we can help with
that. Put you right to work.

(clearing throat)

I'm kidding.

Smell that.

Mm! Ooh, sold!


Where's the cheese?

9, 10, 11, 12.

How many different kinds
of cheeses are there?

You guys mentioned
putting me to work.

Were you thinking, like,
manning the front desk?


No, we're talking about baking.

Oh.

Oh, you wouldn't want
us in your kitchen.

Uh, speak for
yourself, pretty lady.

I can bake.

Since when? Are you some
kind of secret baker?

Oh!

Look at the soap dishes.
They're so cute! I need one.

Do you really need a soap dish?

I think it's an olive dish.

To-may-to, to-mah-to.

Oh, look at these!

Alright. So, what kind of
baking are we talking about?

Pies.

Pies...

Pies I can do.

â™ª

What the heck is that?

I have no idea what
happened last night.

Coffee?

Yup.

Good morning. You guys
here for the buffet?

Both: Just coffee.


Thought so. What can I get you?

I would love a
gingerbread latte,

but if it's a syrup,
only half a pump,

and if you have 2% milk,
that would be great,

And also, if you could put just
a little splash of cinnamon.

(chuckling nervously) Uh,
how about a dark roast

with a splash of
farm fresh milk?

So coffee?

I'm... I'm still
the new kid in town,

but next Christmas
I'll definitely have

crimbo ginger apple
crumble-topped

cappuccino nailed,
but until then...

Coffee is fine.

Okay. How about you?

Same thing.

Uh, for here or to go?

Both: To go.

Great, awesome.

And it's a good thing I
caught you when I did!

Good morning!

Both: Morning.

I just wanted to thank you.

We woke up this morning
just feeling so much better

about everything.

That... That's great.
That's wonderful.

About what exactly?

You know that old saying.
Many hands make light work.

So, thank you for
insisting on helping.

Did I?

With baking all those pies?

No, that would be way too much.


But the round-up will
still be a huge help.

Round-up? Is that... Is
that... Is that difficult?

Hopefully it's not too hard
since you're doing it together.


So, all we have to do is round
up the ingredients for the pies?

Mm-hm.

Okay, that shouldn't
be too hard.

And I made a list of
all the stops for you.

Stops?

Why can't we just walk
to the local market

or make a Costco run?

Gotta get everything
local, from the source.

And I'm sure you don't want to

hoof everything
back for 200 pies.

So, who drives stick?

â™ª

(engine turning over)

Not a word.

â™ª

Alright, what's
first on the list?

I don't know. You tell
me, Mr. Volunteer.


Look, I'm sorry that
I got us into this.

Let's just get it done so we
can get back to our rooms.

And we can give each
other some space.

You can, I don't
know, read a book,

open up a bottle of...

Peppermint tea.


This is where we
pick up the pie tins?

(Christmas music
sung by cats playing)

And that's all I need.

Thank goodness we realized
Kyle prefers the goose feather

over the duck down. That
made all the difference.

You ain't kiddin'.

That's her pillow,
you silly peanut.

By, Kyle.

I'll call you when it's ready.

Cindy: Okie-doke.

Wow, that's a lot of alpacas.

Yup.

That's interesting
Christmas music.


I was wondering
when you'd get here.

Who? Us?

How did you...

We're a very tight community.

Is that an alpaca with a hat?

You meant Dente.

As in Al?

Yeah, he's a local celebrity.

Oh, right. Yeah,
we've met before.

Yeah, yeah. My dog was
sniffing at your treats.

Is this really the place
where we get the pie tins?

Yes. I help organize the market.

Now, you have a terrier, right?

Yeah, good memory.
His name's Jerry.

Ah, as in, uh, Garcia?

No, as in Ben and.


But hey, if you have
any interest in having

Jerry's portrait done
while you're here...

Yeah, he's not much of a sitter.

I work off photographs, too.

She does.

Well, if you change your mind,

I will be working through
Christmas regardless, so.

Okay, uh...

Thank you.
Thanks.

Yeah.
Kayla: Great.

Thanks. I'm gonna take these.

Good luck.

Bye.
See ya!

Bye.
Kayla: Bye.

Robby: Okay.

Bye.

Goodbye.

Kayla: Yup. Bye-bye.

â™ª

(rooster crowing)

Rebecca: Okay, last stop.

Robby: Oh. Hey, horse.
Why the long face?

Hey. Hi.
Rebecca: Hi.

Hi. Hello.
Robby: Bless you. Hello.

Hello?

Oh.

Ah, hey.

Rebecca: Hi, Vince
and Brian sent us?

Merry Christmas.

And God bless us, every one.

I always like to get
it on the first take.

We get a surprising
amount of requests,

especially at Christmas.

Requests for...

Alpaca grams.

Everybody loves
a talking alpaca.

This must be Dente.
Is this Dente?

Oh, told you you're a legend.

We came for the...

I know. Robby, you're
on butter. Becca, eggs.

Okay.

Follow me.

Hi.

â™ª

I think I just need
my book and bed, stat.

Yeah, well, I'm
right there with you.

Let's take the
keys, drop them off,

and sneak upstairs.

(laughing)
They can unload.

Kay.

(singing scales)

â™ª Fi, fi, fi, fi, fi

Good.

â™ª Fi, fi, fi, fi, fi

Oh, you're back!

Just in time.

Technically we waited for you.

For what?

Caroling.

Oh, you don't need to do that.
You didn't need to do that.

After today? Of course we did.

Bonnets for the ladies,
top hats for the gentlemen.

Uh, unfortunately we don't
have anything like that, so...

Not to worry. We do.

Both: Of course they do.

For you!


Thank you.

You know, as fun
as this would be,

we have to unload
the ingredients.

Please, your work is done.

We got this. All
you have to do is...

Get into character, Gov'na!

(all laughing)

(continuing scales)

â™ª Fi, fi, fi, fi, fi

â™ª Fi, fi, fi, fi, fi

(camera snapping)

Definitely posting.

Nope.

Brian: Good evening.

Okay, everyone. So,
just stay bundled up

and sing from your heart.

And hot chocolate
at the gazebo after.

Ooh!
(ringing bell)

â™ª We wish you a
merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª And a happy new year

(Brian & Vince laughing)

Do you organize this, too?

Oh, no. It's just something
we've been doing forever.

Yeah, but when you
send the email out,

everyone shows up.

Even with the bonnets?

I know I do.

It's just a sweet tradition,

but a good reminder
of simpler times, too.

I like that.

Kayla: You look really
great. I mean, it's a good...

You look really great.
Where'd you get that?


We should get in
line. It's going fast.

Do you remember that hot
chocolate we had at Bouchon?

Oh, it was like drinking
fudge, it was so good.

Our contractor is amazing.

He wants more time and
he wants more money.

I gotta... I gotta call
this guy right now.

I'm going to go back to the, uh,
to the inn. I'll check on Jerry.

Hey! Dude, you were
supposed to be done...

Who's ready for "Jingle Bells?"

Uh, well, I just don't
want the leak to get worse.

So, if you could make
it by the end of the day

that would be best. Great.

Thank you. (sighing)

So, our new server called
in sick on her first day.

Don't worry. I will help
you and we'll just...

We'll take it from there, so.

I thought you said we were
baking the minis today

since they box and
store so beautifully

and the big ones not so much?

I did, but a few
things have come up.

A few?

What kind of things?

Oh.

â™ª

Uh, word is on the street that
I can borrow one of these?

Just make sure that you
return them when you're done.

Okay.

If we're lucky, he'll be out
here by the end of the day.

To fix the leak?

Yes, you now need to be here.
I now need to be in there.

And who's in the kitchen making
all the pies we committed to?

It's just the minis today,

and I am still working
my way towards that.

Brian: See, that's why I didn't
want to take on too much.

It's not like we knew that
this was going to happen.

It's not about that.

It's about stretching ourselves
too thin every Christmas.

I just want everything to
be special for all of us.

(clearing throat) We can help.

No, you already did.

I mean, with the baking or...

You really want to bake?

Well, yeah, if it'll help.

I mean, actually, I
took a course, so.

In what? Baking?

When?

It was a while... a while...

There was a souffle course
that I took at Milk Bar,

and I took it a month ago.

Wow. Okay, since one of
us is apparently a baker,

why don't you, um, dive in?

With your help, too, right?

I mean, you know, many hands.

Of course.

Great!

Thank you.

These are detailed
instructions for the minis.

I printed up a copy
for each of you,

and you have my cell.
Okay.

So, if you need anything,
just give me a call,

and I will come running.

Vince, we have the pies handled.

Do not be afraid.

Great. Oh!

And you will need these.

Huh?
Very cute.


Thank you.

Thanks.

"Christmas baking crew."

It just never came up?

Why didn't you just tell
me about the baking class?

We've been like
two ships passing.

You know that.

I know.

It's just kind of odd.

It didn't seem like you.

Maybe you when we first met

or even when we
were first married,

but not you in the
last five years.

It's just a baking
class, you know?

Thought it was gonna be
fun. You were working.

I know.

Just...

Maybe I would have liked to
take the baking class with you.

â™ª


What can I get you?

Oh, I suppose whatever's
quick and easy.

I don't have a lot of time to
eat before this guy goes off.

Oh, um, may I
suggest a sandwich?

Yes, you may. What is
your favorite vegetarian?

Cranberry stuffing.

Ooh, okay. Yes.
Definitely, definitely.

Okay.

Robby: Hey.
Antonio: Hey.


What can I get you?

Um, I'm going to have
whatever she's having.

Alright.
What are we having?

A cranberry stuffing sandwich.

Sounds good.
Yeah, sounds good.


What are these, Antonio?

Your stockings.

Every guest gets
one to decorate.

Oh, we don't have time.
Oh, yeah. We...

We got pies in the oven.

There's always time to decorate.

And you can always come
back for more supplies

if you don't finish.

You know, I do like to decorate.

I know you do.

Here, you wanna do
mine? It'll be quicker.

No, you do your own.

You got good ideas.
You're creative.

I am gonna use this, though.


Okay.

Look at all of this bling.

With a little time to spare.

You know, you got a little empty
real estate there on the bottom.

Really?

Yeah. Now, this.

That's ridiculous. (laughing)

(phones pinging)

Both: Aww. They're at Le Souk.

Marseilles, wasn't that
with the chicken "tageen."

Tagine.

Tagine?
Yes.

Actually, I remember
the fig mille-feuille

with sabayon cream.

Yeah, how do you remember
the name of that?

It was so good.

Well, I remember you
ate half of mine.


Actually, I think I ate
mine and all of yours.

But you said you
were happy to share.

I was.

It was our third anniversary.

I think we should
send them a picture.

Right now?

We can't keep sending
pictures of Jerry

or selfies of each one of us.

They're gonna, you know,
know something's going on.

Look, Becc, we're going to have
to tell them sooner or later.

I know.

Just can it wait until
after Christmas? Okay?

Sure.

Here.

(clearing throat)

Alright, you ready?

Yeah. It can't look forced okay?

One, two, three.

(camera snapping)

Let's see.

It's good enough.

It really slipped your mind?

What?

The whole secret souffle series?

No. I wanted to
bake a cake for you.

In our brand new
kitchen at Christmas.

To surprise you.

Really?

Listen.

I am consumed with work.

I'm all wrapped up and I'm not
a good communicator anymore,

and I don't listen to
you, and I am sorry.

Me, too.

I just wanted this Christmas
to be special for you.

I wanted this Christmas
to be special for us.


Time's up.

Yeah.

(barking)
Come on.


It's beautiful.

I feel so sad, Jerry?

I mean, this is crazy.

How did we get here?

Me, Becca.

I mean, yeah, there's
a ton of stuff

that I could have
done differently,

I know that, but...

Oh, look at that.

It's Santa Clause
and his reindeer.

What are we going
to do now, Jerry?

I know I sound nuts for
asking you for advice.

Cindy: Yup.

Thanks, Cindy.

Hey, Cindy. How's it
going with the windshield?

It's going.

It's going, Jerry. It's going.

Hey, Jerry.

Come up here, boy.

Come here.


Okay, I get it. It looks
really super comfy down there.

(Jerry whining)

Just never thought we'd
end up here, you know?

I mean, not that you
need to worry about it,

'cause you don't.

It's just complicated.

â™ª

â™ª

Vince: Well, hi.

You're up early.
Everything okay?

Yeah, yeah. I just
couldn't sleep.

So, I thought maybe I could
borrow one of those books again?

Oh, please do.

And did you see your stockings?

We hung them up right over here.

Aww.

That's really sweet.

Mm. You know, there's a reason
Lauren sends people up here.

Lauren our marriage coach?

Mm-hm.


Sometimes, we just
need to take the time

to be sweet to each other.

Let us know if you
need anything else.

â™ª

Hey. Becc? (knocking)

Rebecca: Special delivery.

Good morning.

Good morning.

Here. I got you the
strongest they had.

Figured you could use it.

Thank you.

Hm?

Yeah.

So, turns out that Lauren didn't
just hear about this place.

She sends her clients here.

See? I told you she
can't be trusted.

Alright, why do
you have the keys?

Well, I figured we need them

if we're going to get a tree.

Are we?
Yeah.

Where? For here?

Decorating is the
highlight every year.

Why should this year
be any different?

You game?
Yeah.

Get dressed.

Robby: You really figured
out the stick shift, huh?

Rebecca: It's a
Christmas miracle.

Hi!

When Vince called, I
thought for sure you'd be

coming for a Cameo,
but a tree's good, too.


You ever been on a
tractor ride before?

Well, I'm sure I have
at some point in my life

that I can't remember.


I drive you out there.

Look around. When you find
one you like, just holler.

Okay. Sounds easy enough.

Here. I'll help you up.

What are those trees over there?

Returns.

You can't return
a tree, can you?

No, but every so often,
someone cuts one down,

changes their mind, and bails.

Just leaves them there?

You want one of those
trees, don't you?

Well, we can't just leave
them there. It's sad.

It's a tree, Rebecca.

I know.

They need us.

I don't know why anyone would
have abandoned these trees.

They're perfect.
I know!

I can't believe Gabby threw
out all these ornaments.

Look at these cute alpacas.

They are cute.

Hey, do you remember we used
to do a theme every year.

Oh, yeah.

All gold, all silver,
all ribbons, all bows.

It was very specific,
but very fun.

It was fun.
Mm-hm.

And I don't remember
why we stopped.

Well, I do. Remember that year

it was your crazy
energy bar campaign

and I had the even
crazier payroll drama?

Oh, yeah.
Mm.

We just never got
back into the flow.

Yeah, and now we have his
and her Christmas trees.

Yeah.


I think I'm going to go break
for some, uh, macaroons.

Oh.

Do you want anything
from downstairs?

No.

I mean, I gotta
email our guy about

the color of the
stain on the cabinets,

and I'll walk Jerry, and yeah.

We'll, uh... We'll
finish up later, yeah?

Yeah.

Okay.

(door closing)

So, I know you said to
choose the best one,

but I'm sorry, I love them all.

The more the merrier.

So, is Robby coming down?

No, he's busy picking out
the stains for our cabinets.

Oh, do you want me
to put that to go?

No, no. It's okay. He's got it.

So, you have me picking
out your macaroons,

and your husband picking out...

Pretty much our entire kitchen.

It's kind of his thing.

What?

I just think that the kitchen
is the heart of the home.

Shouldn't that make it
both of your things?

Robby: Alright, are you
ready for a little walk?

Come on, Jerry.
Come on. Come on.

Yeah, come on.

â™ª

Hey, Jerry! Where
are you going, buddy?

Hey! Come on. Jerry.

Robby?

Jerry!

Hey, what are you eating, buddy?

Hey, there you are.

Hey.

I know that you said you
didn't want any macaroons,

but it's Christmas,

and they have a
killer assortment.

Yeah? That's very sweet.
What are my options?

Well, candy cane
was really good,

but the eggnog and
gingerbread was ridiculous.

(door slamming)
(gasping)


Is it locked?

(jiggling door)

Am I the only one thinking
about creepy elves right now?


Help!


Yeah, I don't think
anyone can hear you, baby.

These windows are
double pane. (knocking)

Why aren't they
answering their phone?

Ah.

Watch this.

Mm-hm.

Okay.

Hm.

I should have gotten
you a MacGyver toolkit.

Uh, this is my MacGyver tool.

Hey, Robby?

Yeah?

I'm sorry about the remodel.

About assuming that you wanted
to do it all by yourself.

Hey, it's okay. I like
doing it, you know?

Yeah, I know.

Maybe you might have
wanted some input from me?

Uh...

I just assumed it'd be easier.

You know?

Hey, Rebecca.

Mm-hm?

I'm sorry that I didn't listen
to you when you chimed in.

What I didn't realize was
that when you were chiming in

at those moments, it was
because it was important to you.

Thank you. I appreciate that.

Yeah.

(phone pinging)
Oh!

Aww!
Hm?

Look, they went to
Domaine du Bagnol.

Judy loves her wine-tastings.

Mm-hm.
Hey, is that French Jerry?

You think he's still alive?

Look.
Aww.

You know, he's not
as cute as our Jerry.

Yeah. I'm glad
they're having fun.

Oh, come on.

I feel bad about not being
there with them, though.

Ah! Got it!

Rebecca... Whoa! (grunting)

I'm okay.

I thought I heard someone.


Robby: Thank you for
letting us do this.

So, I just feed it to them?


Well, they're big raisin fans.

We kind of thought that you
were, uh, going to do it.

When the request comes
from out of town,

but since you're here
and wanted to voice it,

it's all you, and you, too.

Ah, okay. Okay. Thank you.

Well, they wanted pictures,
we're giving them alpacas.

Yeah, it'll make them
smile. Are we ready?

Yeah.

Okay, action.

Robby & Rebecca: Hi,
Becca and Robby's parents.

Rebecca: The kids wanted us
to let you know that Christmas

won't be the same without you.

But they want you to
have an incredible time!

Rebecca: Merry Christmas!

Je t'aime! Patch banane!

(beeping)
(laughing)

Did you just say, "I
love you, banana patch?"

No, I just said, "I
love you, have fun."

I'm pretty sure you
said "banana patch."

Mm.

It was "banana patch."

Geez. They nibbled me.

I mean, it's like a
cute little nibble,

but it's definitely a nibble.

Aww, he was hungry.

And apparently so am I.

Yeah, you know
it's after 5:00.

Oh.

Would you like to
have dinner with me?

Sit down, napkin on a lap.

Like a date.

We've been married for 13
years, and I don't know why,

I'm nervous asking you that.

Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.

After you.

No.


No.

Uh-huh. It's festive.

Way too much. Way too much.


You look beautiful.

Thank you.

It's just comfy.


Shall we?


Kayla: They really
outdid themselves.

They did a great
job last year, too.

I think that suit
might be cheating.

I refuse to wear an
ill-fitted sweater,

but I did bring the
ugly. Does this count?

Nice, next year I'm rocking

the handkerchief
instead of this.

Oh, you can pull anything off.

Are you flirting with me?

Ah, that's not a great start.

Should we go somewhere else?

Yeah.

Come in!
Oh, hi.

Oh, we can't crash
your holiday party.

It's our staff party, and
it's always open to friends.

Come on.

We got martinis and you already

got your ugly sweater
on, so come in.

Are you talking to me?

Vince: Cheers!

So, the Christmas parade.

This is the biggest event
of the holidays around here?

Yeah, no one misses
it, man. No one.

Even our fur families come out.

It sounds like a huge
parade. I can't wait.

It really is quite the event.

I can't wait to see Rosie
in the parade tomorrow.

Oh, would Jerry want
to ride with Rosie?

She would love the company.

I mean...

Yeah, I mean, it would
be a cute picture.

Yeah.
Kayla: Any chance you got

the fixings for a white
chocolate martini?

I can make it.

No, you can't work at
your own holiday party.

That's just...

Um, I can.

Really?
Yeah.

No, she can. That's
where we met.

Bartending together in college.

Yeah, very romantic, I know.

Well, I would love one, too,
if it's not too much trouble.

Yeah, no. Not at all.

As long as I have my bar back.

Yeah. I measure, you pour.

Yeah.

Alright, we got the first
one. I got the first one.

Mama's a little generous.

That's a shot. That's a shot.

Yeah!

Oh, no.

Kayla: You've done this before.


Antonio: Whoa!
You made those!

Cute, right?

Alright, let me do
champagne glasses.

My specialty.

All: Whoa!

Now it's a party!

Yes, yes, yes!

Alright, get ready.

Oh, my gosh.

That was really good.
College, huh?

Yeah.

Oh, guys. Look at
that, look at that.

(Kayla gasping)

Looks like you gotta kiss.

Um...

I mean.

It's tradition!

All: It's tradition!

â™ª

All: Happy holidays!

â™ª

I say we go with the antlers.

Agreed. You are both fine
and distinguished, Jerry.

Robby: Hey, after you.
Rebecca: Okay.

Ooh, okay. This is a
good spot. This is great.

This is a great spot.

Okay, so Brian said it was
going to go down Main Street

and then loop around.

Did we miss it?

Nope. You're good.

Wow. She is everywhere.

Mm-hm.

Can you do something about that

so I don't lose
the power of sight?

This? Huh.

Better.

(people cheering)

Are they coming?


Oh, look!

(crowd cheering)

Yay!

You know what I
love about parades?

Mm?

Is how excited you get.


Ooh! That is a snowman!

Wow.
Look at that.

Look at that car!

Give it a honk!

(horn honking)

Rebecca: Yes!
Robby: Yeah!

(cheering, applauding)


There's Jerry! Aww!

Jerry!

Okay. Get a picture.
There's our boy, baby.

Get a picture.
There's our boy.

Jerry! Jerry, look at me!

Jerry, right here. (whistling)
Good boy! Good boy!

(crowd cheering)

Robby: We love you, Jerry!

(cheering, applauding)

Okay.

Alright, what's next?

Is that it? That's
the whole parade?

Uh...

Maybe it's going to
loop around again?

Nope.

Or not.

Huh, okay. Well,
either way I feel like

we just sent Jerry
off to college.

Then you're really
going to love this.

Oh, will you send that to me?

I already did.

Did you get it?
Aww, you're the best.

Thanks.

We do make a pretty good
team sometimes, huh?

Yeah.

Hm.

Alright, I'm gonna go get
our dog. He's had a long day.

I'm going to take him back
to the inn, put him to bed,

and then I'll find
you in a little bit.

Yeah, yeah.

Huh? Alright, bye.

â™ª

(bell jingling)

Kayla.

Hi, hi.

Was that Jerry riding in style?

Yes, giving us a
major photo moment.

Oh, yeah.

I was wondering if
it's not too late,

I could maybe take
you up on your offer

to paint his portrait.

For Christmas?

Yeah, well. We just got this.

Oh, come on.

(laughing)
Adorable.

I know it's last minute,

so if you can't fit
it in, I understand.

Now, I would not have
offered if I couldn't.

You sure?

Yeah. Yeah, it's my first solo
Christmas since my divorce.

So, it just feels
good to stay busy.

I'm sorry.

No, I'm not, and
I know he's not.

It's just an adjustment.

Yeah, I can't imagine.

Actually, I can kind of,

'cause I've been
looking at it recently,

but I guess you don't really
know how you're going to feel

until it's, like, a
completely done deal,

and you can't really
change your mind,

'cause you can't go back.

Um, I'm going to email
this to you, okay?

Yeah.

Oh, um, also, it's a
surprise for Robby.

So, can you not mention it?

My lips are sealed. Email me.

Yeah.

Don't forget. Tomorrow night.

Pies for PETS and
the Christmas Market.

Christmas Market. Kay.

Both: Bye.

(bell jingling)

Hey, prepare to be impressed.

Hot chocolate. Half
a pump of peppermint.

Two percent milk and a single
swirl of whipped cream.

Oh, I could cry.

Hm.

Mm. Thank you.

Hey, wrong way.

What do you mean?

I'm about five minutes
away from my sweatpants

and a trashy novel.

Or how about a
holiday light stroll?

A what?

When was the last time you and I
just wandered around aimlessly?

I don't know.

Actually...

Venice.

Eight years ago, remember?

Yes.
Mm.

Do you remember that
Christmas tree we found?

The glass blown? It was huge.

It was very swirly.

Yeah, hard to forget.

Where should we go?

Anywhere.

â™ª

I love how this town
just goes full out.

Yeah, it's kind of like
the theme of this different

little nook of a town.

just bright and light.


I can tell.

'Cause you take
this little inhale,

like you just did,

when you want to
savor the moment.

Really?
Yeah.

You always have.

I'm surprised you noticed.

Why are you saying that?

'Cause I didn't notice that
you stopped eating meat?

You used to notice everything.

At least you made me
feel like you did.

And then gradually you stopped.

Noticing? What?

Me.

Never.

And I hate that
you feel that way.

It's fine.

No, Rebecca. It's not fine.

I wish I knew you felt that way.

Probably should
have said something.

Thank you.

Should we keep going?

I'm following your lead.

â™ª

It's so beautiful.

It is beautiful.

I can't get that
song out of my head.

What song?

"We Wish You A Merry Christmas."

You mean...

â™ª We wish you a
merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish you a
merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish you a
merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª And a happy new year

You mean that song?

Why would that song
stick in your head?

I don't know. (laughing)

Hm.

I haven't seen you laugh
like that in a long time.

Yeah.

I don't think I have laughed
like that in a long time.



â™ª

What?

â™ª

I'm sorry, Becca.

After all this time, I've
taken you for granted.

And I love you.

And I promise

that I have never

stopped noticing you.

And I never will.

â™ª

â™ª

Now, do you know

what time it is?

It's all right.

Both: It's all true.

It all happened.


Stay up with me and
watch our movie?

Now, how do you do this?

It's been, like, 20 years
since I've used a VHS.

Yeah, I still got it.


You ready?

So ready.

Hah! Come here.

â™ª God rest ye merry gentlemen

â™ª Let nothing you dismay

Ebenezer Scrooge!

How now! What do you want of me?

Much!

Who are you?

I was your partner,
Jacob Marley.

You don't believe in me?

Scrooge: Mercy on me,
dreadful apparition!

â™ª


Both: Good morning.

Oh.

Mwah!

Thank you.

You're welcome.

You're such a good sport.

Here we go.

Okay. Let's bake some
pies up in this kitchen.

(Robby & Rebecca laughing)

Hey, guys. Merry Christmas.
Hi.

Okay, I don't need to get more
gifts at the Christmas Market,

but I think I am
definitely going to...

You're absolutely going to.
We're just doing our part.

Exactly.

Ooh.

Both: Wow.

I, uh, I didn't expect that.

Yeah, that was quick.

I mean, not quick, but...

But earlier than expected, huh?

So, what do we do?

I mean, we... we could leave.

I mean, would that be weird?

Leaving?

Yeah, before the market.

Right, the market.

We gotta go and
support the market,

and we gotta see if
the kids like the pies.

Totally! And I have to get my
mom one of those soap dishes.

Soap dish. Right.

Yeah.

So, we stay.

I mean, it would
just be rude not to.


â™ª

I'm glad we didn't miss this.

It reminds me of,
uh, Borough Market.

Ah.

That's what this reminds me of.

Yes.

That was a happy day.

I hope so! It was our
honeymoon. (laughing)

You think we could
get back there?

Where? To London?


To happy days.

I mean, I think
we can if we try.

The last couple of
days have proven that.

Yeah. It's been fun.

We should try.

Yeah. Way more fun
than I expected.

Hey.

Come on. We both
know what I mean.

Mm.

That right there. See that?

That what I always
pictured for us.

What? Sitting on a bench,

eating pie with two
forks and no plate?

Growing old together.

Me, too.

Did you two see that line?

The kids are absolutely
loving the minis.

Did you want to try one?

No.

We can't steal food
from kids, man.

Don't worry. I think we're
going to have extras. Come.

(phone ringing)

In that case...
Okay.

What's that?

Oh, um, I'll meet you there.

Alright. Say hi.

(phone ringing)

Hey, Mom! Did you
get the link I sent?

Judy: What link?

We sent you a video.

The what?

Okay, hold on.

Oh, it didn't send. Okay,
I'm sending it again now.

Well, I got the
pictures, and, you know,

that's why I was calling.

I just wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

Um, yeah. Of course.
Why do you ask?

Oh, you two took a ton
of photos of Jerry,

very cute,

but there's only
one of you guys.

You know, you didn't
look all that happy.

Oh. (chuckling)

That. That was just early on,
you know, with the windshield

and the car and everything.

Actually, we're having
a pretty great time.

That's a huge
relief for everyone,

but you know I
should have known.

When do you guys ever
have a bad vacation?

I'm so happy you were able
to leave the stress at home.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We did. We did.

Hey.

I saved you one. Guess what?

We crushed it.

These pies are amazing.

Everything okay with your mom?

Yeah, yeah. She's fine.

Yeah, you gonna get her
a Christmas present?

One of those soap dishes?

I-I don't know.

You don't know if you're
going to get her a soap dish,

or you don't know if
that's what she wants?

Did you ask her what
she wants for Christmas?

Yeah.

She said that all she wants for
Christmas is for us to be happy.

Well, why did she say that?

I guess she sensed
something was wrong.

What did you say to her?

I told her not to worry

and that it's been
nice to get away.

Yeah. That's good.

But is that the problem though?

What?

Look at this place.

It's so sweet, quaint,

and completely different
than our day-to-day reality.

It's like we're
in a bubble here.

Yeah, I know, but we're
in the bubble together.

Right, but without any stress...

Ah, yeah, there's been stress.

We're always great on vacation.

Baby, you say that
like it's a bad thing.

'Cause we have to go home.

We have to go back
to our normal lives.

And then everything's gonna go
back to the way it was before.

â™ª

What are you saying?

I've had a great
time here, really.

And I want things to
change, I really do.

But do you really
see that happening?

Really?

â™ª

Becca...

Let's just go home
in the morning, okay?

Now, I'm going to go
up to the hotel room

and I'm going to pack our bags.

Okay?

Kay.

â™ª

(exhaling, sniffling)

â™ª

â™ª

Rebecca: We enjoyed every
minute of it. Really.

Even the one with
the giant ornament?

Okay, well, that
wasn't really ideal,

but the rest.

Or maybe there were a few more,

but either way,

I would give you guys
a very high rating.

On Yelp?

Don't push it.


Merry Christmas.


Well, I hope you guys come back.

Yeah. We'll see.

Nothing's ever perfect.

No one, especially.

And sometimes you just need
to rip everything apart

and make a total mess

and rearrange it the
way you want it to be.

It's what we did.

â™ª

Take care.

â™ª

(Jerry panting)

I never wanted it
to end here, buddy.

I never wanted it to end.

And I guess...

Well, I guess I
thought it never would.

And maybe, maybe that's
the problem, huh?

Maybe that's the problem.

(bell jingling)

It took me a few tries
to nail his expression,

but I think you're going
to be happy with it.

Antonio.

Hey.
Hey.

Um, I was going to wait until
the buffet tonight to...

to give this to you, but...

What is it?

Well, it's a Christmas gift.

Oh, I mean, why?

Do you want, like,
the common explanation

involving St. Nicholas?

You know what I mean.

Oh, well, now you know
why I didn't want to

give it to you in
front of everyone.

Right.

Don't worry, it's just, um...
Just a little something.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

(doorbell jingling)

(door closing)

Both: Hey.

(bell jingling)

Is that from...

Yeah.

Well, I'm pretty sure there's
not an evil elf inside.

You gonna open it?

What if it's sweet?

Well, what if it is?

He clearly likes you.

We're friends, you know?

And we should just
stay friends, right?

Well, only you can
answer that, right?

Just open it.


Oh, come on. So cute.

â™ª

Thank you.

â™ª

Bye.

Kayla: Bye.

(bell jingling)

â™ª


â™ª

Hey.

Hey, I got everything.

Thanks for doing that.

Yeah, of course.

Where's Jerry?

I wanted him to play outside
before we were in the car.

Okay, I'll go get him.

Okay, and I will
get these loaded.

Both: Hey.

You're here early
for the buffet.

Yeah, I just wanted
to say thank you.

You opened it?

(clearing throat)


No, a little bit, but I like it,

and maybe you, too.

So, um,

after the holidays, you
wanna grab that dinner?

Like, um... like a date?

We don't need to label it.

Oh, d-dinner it is.

Cool.

Okay.

We can go here.

Yeah, that...
Or somewhere else.

Yeah. Maybe somewhere else?

Yeah.



â™ª


â™ª

Okay, Jerry. Come on. Come on.

Come on, buddy. We
have to go home.

See, that... that's the problem.

Nothing is going to feel like
home unless we're together.

Now, I know that we
have tried everything,

remodel, trying to stay busy,

that we have just forgotten

how to look at each other

and how to listen to each other,

and how to spend time
together. I miss you already.

Baby, I have missed
you for years.

But how do you say that to
someone when they're standing

right in front of
you the whole time?

You just did.

We don't get along on vacation
because we're on vacation.

We get along because we
make time for each other.

We did forget to make
time for each other.

You really think
that's going to change?

We'll change our priorities.

I'm going to make
you my priority.

I love you.

I will always love you.

And I will always love you.

I have missed this.

I've missed us so
much, putting us first.

Do you really think we can?

We will.

We just have to do it together.

â™ª

So, the 26th, if that
still works for you guys.

As long as it doesn't
complicate things too much?

You know we would
love to have you back.

Just didn't know it
would be so soon.

Vince: But we're happy
about it all the same.

Brian: Yes.

And you'll join us
for dinner tonight?

It's more of a buffet.

As long as it's before 6:00.


And one key or two?

I think one is good.

I think one is great.

Man: Yeah, can we please
just check out and go home?

Woman: I didn't want to
come in the first place.

(banging outside)
(gasping)

(car alarm blaring)

Um...

(alarm blaring)


(alarm blaring)

Well, I guess they'll be
staying a little longer.
