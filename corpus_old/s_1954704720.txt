So the doctor told me,
I needed a transfusion.

What would be no problem,
If I had not rare blood type.

A.B negative. Luckily my cousin Sophia...

she's my mother's side...
Sophia was in town to visit Marilyn.

She lost her cat and
because ours just had a litter...

Do you have a cat, Douglas?

No ma'am, I'm allergic to them.
This is a shame.

A cat can be a good company.

If you come here from around here?
No, no.

Where do you come from?
Mrs. Brennan...

I think it is repaired.
Thank you Douglas.

It's not really logical, an old building
refurbishment, which will be demolished.

How much do I owe you?
Nothing, it's part of my job.

Drink your tea but,
I read the leaves.

I see the letter 'J',
that important to you?

No, not at the moment.

It is someone who is very important,
in your life.

Someone you care about very much.
A woman.

No... There was someone,
but it is now.

She comes back.
No, Mrs. Brennan...

I do not think that will happen.

Julie?

When I get some heat in this hovel?

<i>Dreams have returned.
But they are our dreams?</i>

Julie <i> I saw last night.
She sat in the chair.</i>

<i>Just as I found her that night.</i>

<i>Looking to the heavens
with a bullet hole in her skull.</i>

<i>How did they find me here?</i>

<i>I found Julie's body,
perished in the apartment where we lived.</i>

My revolver <i> verchroomde.38
into clutching her dead.</i>

<i>By then I was convinced
the supernatural was involved...</i>

<i>in a very tangible way.</i>

What happened to Julie <i>
and other strange occurrences...</i>

<i>were more frequent.</i>

<i>But the naked truth is,
that I did not care.</i>

<i>Julie, was back
and that was the most important.</i>

Hi, sorry to bother you but...

I am the key
My apartment forgotten.

Do you mind?

No, no problem.

<i>It seems every girl
I meet reminds me of her.</i>

<i>They say if you love someone,
You should leave them free.</i>

<i>And if they come back,
then they belong to you.</i>

Hey, are you the new caretaker?
Yes, sir, that's me.

That we needed that.
A new caretaker.

For a building is demolished.
Well, we still have some months to go.

I hope you are better than the latter
concierge. You know what he did?

He had a secret room
down there in the boiler.

Where he kept his girls magazines.
He thought no one knew.

But I do.
I've been here longer than anyone else.

Now they want to throw us all.

But I'm not leaving,
before I'm ready.

Nice to meet you, sir.
My name is Thompson, Bill Thompson.

You can ask me whatever you want.
I've been here longer than anyone else.

Mr. Thompson, I still have a
contract to renovate this building to...

and there is still some on my list.
So if you do not mind...

I'm very polite goodbye.

I know everything that happens here.

For example, I know that there
a homeless girl living downstairs...

in that room at the end of the hall.
Yeah, I know. I'm going down...

and I will be recording.
You have a nice day, Mr. Thompson.

If you want to know about 'the Hagstone"
then you ask me.

Can I help you?

There are some neighbors complained about you, okay?
I see it like this...

They're going to demolish this building,
So you can stay here.

But, stay out of sight
and keep your head down, okay?

You're welcome.

Can you fix my toilet, Douglas?
Excuse me?

My lovely little toilet,
it does not flush well.

Do not you think you are a little too far?

Tonight can not.
How about tomorrow night?

No, not tomorrow. The next few days
I am out of town, so I'm sorry.

That's okay. Then I have to
the gas station down the street.

Good night.

We are still playing. I expel In one U.S. dollar.
Let's see whether that is enough.

<i>Carl was ordained a priest,
around the time that Julie died.</i>

<i>I did not believe in that religious crap
and he knew it.</i>

I pass. I wonder what you got?

<i>Three farmers.
Yes, three farmers.</i>

Three women.
I once had a queen.

<i>Carl, Julie's brother,
So just about family.</i>

Will you play another?

What does your brother for a living, Carl?

He is now in caretaker
an apartment building, right? But...

He was a famous journalist.
Oh, you mean that?

Yes, a big boy.
Hey, can I decide?

Then you must answer quickly.

Share your are, or what?
I'm sorry, man.

It's all right.
I get though.

Okay, one more round.
Another round.

The last, give Carl, maps, please.

How are you?
Hey, Carl...

I've already told you,
what a great brother you are?

I want you to know.

Carl, I've seen her, really.

I've seen Julie.

<i>After that night, I knew that Carl,
was not the one who would help me.</i>

<i>He did not believe how real,
Julie for me.</i>

He would never know <i>
how much I loved her.</i>

<i>Nothing in this world
between two people in love are.</i>

Not even a damn grave <i>.</i>

Come here.

Got a light?

Do not you cold, here?

No, I'm lonely.
Have you ever been lonely?

Only when I think of it.
Would you like some coffee?

I can not go in.

$ 20 and we are
Neither lonely anymore.

Please, I'm cold.

Damn it. What the hell are you?

I... I can not.

You owe me $ 20.

Douglas? He has done it again.

Now, that has been there two days.

Okay, Mrs. Brennan, I'll settle.

Mr. Witkowsky?

Mr. Witkowsky?

Mr. Witkowsky...

Mr. Witkowsky.

Mr. Witkowsky?

Dear Jesus.

Mrs. Brennan, you want here
probably not come.

Dear Jesus.

I always knew he masturbated.

My little Victoria.
I'd have to call her Houdini.

Do you like cats?
No, I'm allergic.

I'm allergic to them.
Are you scared of me?

Why?
What was all the excitement last night?

That was Mr. Witkowsky,
they said he had a heart attack.

These are his clothes. I need to contact
the poor devil his family.

Tonight would be perfect, Douglas.

What?
For toilets.

Oh yes, that's the toilet.
Sorry, tonight?

Yes, tonight would be perfect.
How about 19:00?

Do not be late.

Hello?
Hello, John Witkowsky, the brother of Sam.

Are you the caretaker?
Yes sir, I am.

My mother and I come along to his stuff
to pick and I...

and I wish you a favor.
Whatever you want.

It is a little sensitive,
I can count on your discretion?

This allows you

I hope no unpleasant surprises
to find the apartment of Sam.

No embarrassing discoveries.
I understand completely.

And you will not regret.

Hello?
Douglas? Come inside.

She wants you to eat her.
Do you mind?

It's in the fridge.

No, great.

<i>Come here, Douglas.</i>

You do not mind that I
formatting while you work? I'm late.

You should do what you do.

It seems that only
the chain off cases.

I'm sorry that I did not before.
That gas station was determined no fun?

I just, Sam used the toilet.
Sam?

Witkowsky.
Mr. Witkowsky?

<i>I have the gun, today
exactly one year ago buried.</i>

<i>And then I buried her.</i>

<i>But sometimes takes a turn death
and comes straight at you.</i>

<i>Then you have two choices. You may be
afraid and stabbing your head in the sand.</i>

<i>Or you can keep the wheel straight
and accelerate.</i>

<i>I was not on the night she Julie
driven to suicide.</i>

<i>I lay half-conscious on the back
of a Buick, ready for demolition.</i>

<i>But one thing I know for sure.
It was their fault.</i>

I do not think it is on the phone.
I will check the central point...

but if the problem is between here
and there, I can not help it.

Then I have someone to call.

How do you here? Do you job?

Yeah, I mean the building feels
good, you know. Absolutely.

The tenants are nice, most of it.
Some are eccentric but...

that's probably all true. If only
not someone always on your door slams...

it will go.
It's true.

And what are you doing?
What I do?

Yes.
I am a nurse, I work at night.

Mrs. Thomas Brennan fits.
She takes care of him often.

And she has cats, so he likes
to go there and play with them.

Yes, I've seen her cats.

He is a bit shy
but it's a good kid.

He also has a good mother.

Douglas...
Yes, Mrs. Brennan?

You listen us?
No, Mrs. Brennan...

Mrs. Holloway has some problems
with the phone.

Barbara.
Well, that's a nice girl.

Not like those below.
That cheap, dirty blonde?

Yes, those cheap, dirty blondes
need somewhere to live.

And that ridiculous cat hair is also release.
I just saw him in the laundry room.

I will look at it, Mrs. Brennan.

Thomas, you go and clean up stuff on.
And then I will become a lunch for you.

Douglas, I think this woman might
a prostitute.

I've seen her take men away.
Men who looked good.

With suits and ties.
I know nothing of, Mrs. Brennan.

Last night, she took a male.
I looked through my kitchen window.

They came in a white car
and that car is still there.

Mrs. Brennan, I think I
but once that cat go searching.

<i>Here, kitty...</i>

<i>Here, kitty...</i>

Damn... Tory?

Victoria? Here, kitty...

Damn it.

You forgot this.
Thank you.

Are you asking me inside.
Of course, follow your heart.

Sorry for all my properties
that are lying around.

Do you drink?
Yeah, I need some whiskey.

How does your toilet it?
Excellent.

Have you recently seen a pussy.
What?

A girl, you know what that is, right?

Yes, I can vaguely remember something.

Do you?
Do I what?

Seen a kitten?
I have one myself.

Yes, some people have good luck. Do you know
anything about the white Buick, outside?

Mrs. Brennan asked for it. I thought,
that maybe your friends were.

Well, Mrs. Brennan has it wrong.

So, what do you think?

Where?

What's so funny?
I... I do not know.

Do I scare you, Douglas?

Is something bothering you, honey?

Yes, I do not know what happens to me.

But let me go my way.

Shit.

So you think that Mrs. Brennan alone?
Yes, to my knowledge.

No signs of forced entry into the building,
the locks or windows?

No visitors in her apartment?
No strangers hanging around?

Detective, almost everyone here is
almost a stranger to me.

Yes, why?
I am here only briefly.

How long have you been in this building?
Soon, a few months.

And before that?
You know, here and there.

Do you now what to stay longer? Not
really, they demolish the building soon.

Where are you going, Douglas?

Come detective, I'm not waiting.

I still have 6 mugs, AB negative
to mop up for dinner.

Well, you only mopping up blood.

Talk to you later.
Have a nice day.

Karna?

Karna?

Are we still doing it or what?
My plane leaves in a few hours.

A few hours, huh?

Do you think you can stand it for so long?

<i>Pull him out. Yes...</i>

<i>Deaths Mary Ann Riley.</i>

Hi, Douglas.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but...

Is there a problem?
No, I...

Okay, why do not you come inside?

Do you drink?
Yes, please.

A beautiful space.

It looks forward to
that a bachelor lives here.

Are you a writer?
I try now and then.

Sorry it's so cold here.
I do like the cold.

Okay.

So... Where is Thomas?

He is my mother.
I got to rest for you.

Yes.

I could not go, I work at night.
It must be tough.

Yes.

It'll be fine with him.

I'm sorry Mrs. Brennan.
It must be hard for you.

Especially for Thomas.

I saw you talking with that detective.
What did he say?

They treat each case as murder.
He asked some questions and...

He told me that she would speak,
whatever that may mean.

Douglas, I must tell someone.

I've seen things in my apartment.

Yes, I'm sorry, Barbara.
I think it's better when you leave.

<i>Barbara, was a nice woman.
A good woman.</i>

But there were <i> ugly things to happen.
I had to take her away.</i>

And treat her like shit <i>.
I wanted out of her picture.</i>

Would you like some tea...
Douglas.

Would you like some tea, Douglas?
No, thank you, Mrs. Riley.

How long have you been for the newspaper, Douglas?
I do not really, sir.

I make a freelance article.

And you also said you had a love,
who committed suicide?

Yes ma'am, my wife.

I know this is painful for you
And I appreciate you taking time.

Bring it on. Ask what you want.

It is very difficult
to explain this, but...

have you ever
thought to the possibility that...

Your daughter could still live?
What do you say?

That her own death,
has put in scene.

That is nonsense.
I know, sorry, I did not...

Would you like a cookie or...
No, thank you ..

I...
You'd better leave immediately.

I'm sorry sir.
I would ask one may ask?

Why did your daughter
to exhume and cremate?

What are you talking about?

I was in the cemetery.
You were in the cemetery?

Yes sir, I am gone.
I do not know what you intend...

but I warn you
You come here with the weird stories...

Mr. Riley, I've been to the cemetery
and I saw the open grave.

I'm sorry, I thought you knew.
Are you sure?

Yes, sir, I'm sure.
I call our lawyer.

<i>I had the vague feeling that the Rileys,
told me everything about her death.</i>

<i>And because the authorities still
drew nearer...</i>

<i>I knew that it was better
I quickly found an answer.</i>

Douglas.
Detective, what brings you here?

I was just nearby.

I tried to reach you,
but your phone is locked.

Yes, it happens,
if you do not pay the bill.

Come, step.

I have a choice?
Of course.

Am I arrested?
Would you be arrested?

No milk and no sugar, right?
Black.

If the night.

You know her?
Jesus Christ.

I do not know. You do not know.

Were you not with a prostitute in Heads
Water Truck Stop, the 16th of this month?

Yeah, I mean is that a crime?
Yes, that's a crime.

Yes, I know, but really, literally,
regarding sex crimes and so...

But what I meant is that they
whether we, as you say...

have the 'act' is not practiced.

Three dead in ten days, Douglas.

All in one way or another
In connection with you.

You know, even my wife Lucille,
which has a very open mind.

Even they would say
this is more than coincidence.

The death of your wife.
There was never an autopsy, right?

No.
Well, that will change.

This is an order of excavation.
I open the case again.

You can not do.
I've already done.

I love you from, I get a lawyer.
What?

You can not even your phone bill.

Is there anything you
I would like to tell, Douglas?

Okay, there's that woman,
who lives in the building.

Her name is Karna.
She lives in apartment three.

Her real name is...
Apartment three, which must be empty.

That's right, it should be free.
But that girl is there withdrawn.

It seems that there are more unoccupied
In that old building Hagstone now.

Can I go?
Listen, you...

If you do not already know, are you now
an official suspect in this case.

The only thing I have not, is a motive.
But that will come with time.

Going back to The <i> Hagstone,
always made me feel secure.</i>

<i>It was like a fortress for my soul.</i>

<i>A place for my memories and where Julie,
wandering through the endless corridors.</i>

And I stared <i>
the black frozen windows.</i>

<i>Hagstone As long as we had
Julie and I were always together.</i>

Hi, I'm John Witkowsky,
are you the caretaker?

Yes, I'm Douglas.
Here, this is for the effort.

No, you do not have to.
This is my mother.

Pleasant, madam.
She is not well off, recently.

Douglas, do you know whether my brother
dealt with someone, had a girlfriend?

No, I would not say.
It is because credit card statements...

that seemed to...
Well, we should get going.

Mother, it's time to go.
Thank you again.

Barbara, you were just in my apartment?
Of course not.

I advise you, now leave the building.
What's going on?

Barbara, go away, go to your son.
Would you tell me what's going on?

You should leave the building right now.

We need to talk.
Fuck off.

You look bad, Douglas.
You need a drink, I think.

I do not drink.
I want you to leave this damn building.

Why do not you sit down?
Sit down.

Victoria. There you are.

I know who you are.
Really?

And who am I?
You are Mary Ann Riley.

I do not know why or how, but you put
your own death scene 3 years ago.

And what does it matter you?
That would not be...

but I'm pretty sure that when you
Two murders, perhaps three are involved.

How many are you involved there?
What?

What do you mean that?
Was it a sick joke or something?

Why do not you drink? Drink.

I want to show you something, Douglas.

<i>Greet and eat...</i>

<i>Greet and eat...</i>

Douglas? What are you doing?

Who are you thinking you are?

I am a good person.
That is a joke.

I am a good person.

How are you?
Do you want coffee?

Where am I?
My doorbell rang at 05.00.

I opened the door and there you were.

I told you to go away?
I'm leaving tomorrow.

That's better.
And I also think you should leave.

That does not, I have a contract.
I am the caretaker.

Douglas, the heater does not work,
There is no one, outside of you and me...

and the blonde woman down.

Karna, that's me one, right?
Listen...

You have to get out, Douglas.

And if you like you can with me.
No, I'm sorry, Barbara.

I am not so.
I have some things to do.

Where are my glasses?

I think you get it, but
to regulate all.

Yeah, I think I should do it.

Where are my boots?

<i>Douglas...</i>

She's gone.

Douglas, I want to help.
How can I help?

I want you to bring me somewhere.
Okay.

I'm sorry Barbara, this must be strange.
It's okay.

What does she know, Douglas?
Not much.

What's going on?

Are you sure you want to know?

Yes, I'm sure.

My sister Julie was a Satanist.
What?

She and Douglas participated
to a fertility ritual satanic...

a baby can get.
But the child was not meant for them.

The child should be sacrificed
on a black altar.

Are you serious?

That can not be true.

And the sacrifice to be valid...

Both parties must agree.

Barbara...
Douglas has a "demon" in his soul.

And that soul is in great danger.
And he will need.

You must decide whether you
it can do for him.

I think I can.

How do you feel?
They dig her, Carl.

That's what they wanted all along.
That the police would dig it.

They want the body of Julie.
We must stop them.

They want us, Douglas.
No, they want her.

Why is this happening.
What is happening?

The ritual failed. Julie was not pregnant,
There has never been a child.

The whole group witnessed its failure.

And so she committed suicide.
Why did not stop there?

By me, I brought her body
and burial.

What does that make?

Julie, was sworn in to the group.
They shot himself down, with my gun.

And because she committed suicide, was
her body to target for a takeover.

The acquisition, which?
A succubus.

What is a succubus?
A demon prostitute.

They want to Julie what I did.
That's what they always wanted.

I told you, there is his car.

The car from whom?

Of the detective, they will dig Julie.
I have to stop them.

My God.

My God.

It's okay, Bar.

I want to see my son.
Yes.

You must go now.
We need all of this behind us.

And when we do, it starts
then all over again?

Maybe we should face it.
Maybe that's the best.

I will help you.

It looks abandoned.
I'll be the first to enter.

No, let me go.
Why do not we together?

Okay, we start over.

Douglas, an idea began with the acquisition?
I do not know.

How do you feel?
I've never felt better.

It's the building, Douglas.
You take her energy.

I go get the flashlight.

We do get the lights back on,
The fuse box is this way.

It seems that everyone is gone,
that path should be.

Douglas, come on. We must
find a focal point and begin.

Well, think.
They should have given you a hint.

Mr. Thompson, you're still here.
Who is Mr. Thompson?

A crazy, old tenant.
Why would he be here?

I do not know. He wants to remain in
the building, even if they demolish.

He spoke of a caretaker,
who collected porn magazines...

in a warehouse or something.
We would ask him.

Let's start there. That's good.

Mr. Thompson?

Mr. Thompson?

Mr. Thompson?

Mr. Thompson?

Sorry madam, I did not
mean to frighten you.

Well...

It seems that I have some company,
in this old, empty building.

What can I do for you?
Sorry to disturb us, Mr. Thompson.

This is Barbara Holloway, of apartment 12.
Mrs.

And my brother, Carl.

Padre... The case is that we...

have to find something in the building.
And I remember that you offered...

history to explain, and so on.
Of course, sure.

I know everything you need to know
the old Hagstone.

I've been here before all else
came to live here.

And now they think
they can throw me out.

Only by a piece of paper
hanging on the door.

Well, they still have to endure.

I'm not going away.

I remember you saying something about
a hidden storage space, or something?

Yeah, sure.
That was the old caretaker.

Who was for you.

He kept all its leaves,
with women there.

He went over there always
and pulled away throughout the afternoon.

I will tell you that he is the master,
all had masturbator.

They were disturbed that finally caught,
to tear off the hall on the second floor.

That's why he eventually got the sack.

Where do we find space?
Where is it?

Listen, you're done here.

Why do not you to me?

Demon...

Leave this body, be damned!

Douglas.

Let me go. Let me go.

Let me go.

Hold it, Douglas.

Come on, together.

What is this?

Pull it down.

I got it. Forwards.

I recommend you to call your name,
You evil spirit.

I drive you out.

The satanic forces of the enemy.
And all your evil minions...

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

For that he who commands.
He who expelled them from heaven...

to the depths of hell.

It's ready now.

Who was that?

That was the pimp of Karna.
My God.

He's dead now.

We need to find space,
and fast.

Douglas, you said
it was near the boiler room.

But there's nothing there.
I know that area at all.

There must be another way.

Maybe I know.

It is here, this is the crawl space.
The boiler room is on the other side.

Douglas, I'll go with you.
No, Carl, I see them with the flashlight.

She's here. I see her.

It seems like they changed.
Douglas, I'm coming down.

No, do you close the hatch
and let her have not.

I'm here to once and for all
an end to it.

Do it now.

Julie...

Barbara.

No.

My God.

It's over.
No, Carl.

You are not dying.

Yes, I'll go.

You must start a new life.

You have that chance.

Which you deal.

It came in the mail.

But then I found out
Julie was dead.

Douglas...

There's only one way to kill a demon.

You throw him into the fire.

Walk away.

Douglas.

She is, it is Victoria.
You have to kill her.

Get away from her.

I said, get away from her.
Douglas.

I, Barbara.

<i>We must finish this.</i>

<i>I'll help.</i>

<i>As I stood there, looking
the Hagstone, I felt happy.</i>

<i>Fortunately, because I had a place at my
bad memories to leave...</i>

<i>and able to walk away.</i>

<i>The thing that would haunt me.
Was about to be demolished.</i>

<i>It is better not to look back.</i>

<i>So for the next poor devil
who comes, remember this...</i>

<i>Hey everybody, look who's back.</i>

<i>Somewhere, the thing that
the body of my wife managed...</i>

<i>you try to play.</i>

It is unimaginable the bloody reality.
