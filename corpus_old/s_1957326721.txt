I need to tell you something.

A lot of things, actually.

This is going to be tough, but
I have to be honest with it all.

I went through a lot this summer,
and I'm not proud of most of it.

I'm getting ahead of myself.

Let me tell my story from the beginning...

before everything fell apart.

So have you ever actually
met anyone from Wyoming?

No.

Have you been to Wyoming?

I haven't even been
out of California.

Though, I did go to Vegas once.

So, no.

So what reason do we have to believe
that Wyoming actually exists?

There's... Yellowstone.

The National Park?
The National Park.

Well 'National' means government...

Which means that Wyoming is a secret federal operation.
That is crazy.

I'm telling you that if you told someone...

Look, if you told someone
from another country

to point to Wyoming on a map...

Would they be able to do it?

Yes they would!
No! No they wouldn't be able to do it.

They would be able to do it.

I couldn't even do that. They would not be able to...
Dude, did you turn vegan?

What?

Johnny, chill out. It's okay.

That's blasphemous bro. Come on.

I hate you, Wade!

I hate you too, bud.

Come on man. I see thatÂ smile.

I know you love me!

Kubrick once said that it's a mistake to
confuse pity with love.

Like...

Cubic the function?

Hey!

Hey, how's the script coming along?

It's going pretty well. I'm almost done.

Oscar worthy?

Hell no, it's just a short.

The academy has
a category for those yeah but like for the

Yeah, but like...

for the real ones.

I mean, with each one you make
you get better.

You'll get there someday

Thanks.

What's up?

Will wants me to go pick him up some
food and take it to the store.

Do you wanna get anything to eat?

I can't. I'm broke.

I didn't ask you if you had money.

I asked you if you wanted to eat.

Ay, where at then?

Um, Will wants McDonald's, so.

You gonna get a Royale with Cheese?

You just saw that movie like two days ago.

What's wrong with that?

Nothing, I'm...

I'm just so proud.

I'm just trying to keep up with you, man.

I know, and you're doing
such a great job with that.

Alright then, Mr. Director.

Save the tears.

I'm gonna go get ready.

Alright.

Yeah, thanks.

See you at home.

See ya.

Yeah, I could have done a better job at
that last season. i don't know what they

I don't know what they were thinking.

I told you that show was trash.

Yeah. Yeah you did.

Who's fries are you eating?

I'm eatin' mine.

Alright. You always do this.

Do what?

Right when we get home,

you're gonna give me the
fries that you've been eating.

And then you're gonna
take the one that's full.

Who's holding the bag?

Who bought the bag?

And who bought the food in the bag?

Fair point.

Thank you.
Bite it.

I am not gonna bite it.
Bite it!

I am not gonna bite it.

That's not my style.

Gimme the fry.

You're gonna make me crash.

Thank you. God.

Wade!

Wade!

What?

How was work?

The usual.

Whatcha doing?

I'm writing.

Write while you can, buddy.

That's... what I'm doing.

Okay. Whatever.

Um, dinner is gonna be
ready in a few minutes.

Alright.

What's up Johnny?

Dude, I got in.

Wait, where?

Berkeley, dude!

I told you you'd get it.

I can't believe it! I'm off the waitlist.

That's awesome, man.

I can't... I can't even believe it...

Damn.

We're... We're gonna be pretty far away from
each other.

Wade, it's my dream school.

I'll come visit a lot during our breaks

and I'll see how much you've
grown the business with Will.

Or... when you make a huge movie.

Maybe I'll come back to work here too.

Silicon Valley's getting pricey.

Yeah.

I'm happy for you though man. that's like really great
johnny thanks man star of something big means a lot

That's like... really great, Johnny.

Thanks, man.

That start of something big.

It means a lot.

Alright, I... gotta go eat dinner.

Yeah, see you man.

Uh, you still there?

Yeah, my bad... Later.

Yeah, see you man.

Wade!

What?!

What?!

Dinner!

All right!

That night, I finally finished my script.

ItÂ was a simple story... two old
friends learning to part ways.

Something I'd be able to
make on my own...

without too much help.

Hey Wade.

You know you look creepy
sitting on a park bench by yourself, right?

What's this?

The Fraternal Tragedy,
written by Wade Down.

You want me to read this now?

Yeah, now.

Okay, lemme sit.

Hey Wade!

One question!

Huh?

Who am I playing?

You really want to be in it?

YouÂ don't have to if you don't want to...

No, I'm serious. Yeah.

It's a great script,

I want my Oscar nomination,

and, I mean it's our last
summer together soÂ why not?

Thank you man. Um...

Actually, I kind of wrote... had uh...

I kind of had a character
inÂ mind for you already.

Uh, which character?

Um...

The character Kevin.

The backstabber?

Okay, no, not like that.
Wow, Wade. I see what you think of me.

You really think of me that way?
No, I...

I'm just messing with you dude, c'mon.

I can... I can play Kevin.

I don't think I'm a Kevin,
but I can play Kevin.

Perfect. That's what I thought.

Alright. So when do we start filming?

Well this is not gonna
be like my other shorts.

We're gonna need funding.

Will!

Will! Will!

What?

Can you turn that off?

No!

I need to ask you something.

Huh?

Can I borrow some money
for my next project?

No, no, no. We had a deal.

One summer off from the store.

Please?

No work, no pay.

Find the money yourself, Wade.

Where's this dude from?

Some online marketplace.

He's from around here though.

What's taking him so long?

Just give him some time.

I'm sure he's around.

If he's not here in fifteen minutes...

Be patient.

Alright, where is this guy?

I told him what my car looks like.

It's so hot in here.

Where are these guys from?

Around here.

Are there supposed to be two of them?

I didn't think so.

I thought there was only
supposed to be one of them.

Yeah. Me too.

Well, are you sure about this?

Bro, I can't pass this up. It's a steal.

Soon as we secure the ball,

I can resell it for
double, probably triple.

Well I'm gettin' fifty percent, right?

No.

What do you mean, 'no?'

Then why am I here?

Bro you owe me.

We talked about this.

I did you a favor.

That was so long ago.

Oh, no, no, no.

That doesn't count,

That doesn't just go away, man.

We detailed your car for three hours.

Me and my uncle Jorge.

Yeah, well screw you and your uncle Jorge!

No! Uh uh!

You remember that.

You owe me a solid.

Yeah, well that's 'cause
he scuffed my shoe!

I got the black Forces.
What am I supposed to do!

Bullcrap. We spent so long out there,

sweating our butts off for you!

You owe me. You know this.

You're here for security. Nothing else.

Whatever dude.

Man talking about sweating your butts
off, let's just get this over with!

I don't know about this.

It's frickin' hot. Can you turn on the AC?

Do you wanna pay me for a new car battery when my car
goes dead 'cause I'm runnin' the AC for ya? Huh?

Or or would you rather pay me the gas money

whenÂ I turn my turn on
my car to use the AC?

Or actually! Actually!

You can drive my car

all the way down toÂ the gas
station and fill up my tank.

How 'bout that? Huh? Huh?!

You know it's probably worth it, bro.

Honestly, it's like a
hundred and five out here.

And while you're out there,

you can buy me a Slim
Jim and a couple Coronas.

One for me, one for my uncle Jorge.

Yeah, like I said, screw your uncle Jorge!

You owe him too, man.

Okay, well I'm gonna get 'em nice and
warm 'cause I know how you like it.

That's right you are!

Hundred and fifteen degrees 'cause
these frickin' greenhouse gases!

Greenhouse gases?

Yeah, you know. It's like the...

The light comes in and bounces...

It makes it hotter, you know!

It's like ninety degrees outside

but its like a hundred and twenty in here.

Just turn on the AC.

It's like twenty cents of gas!

You're crazy, fool.

Yeah, well whatever bro.

Hey, I was thinking about
this on the way here.

What if I do like an accent.

What? No. Why?

Yeah you know, like uh...

What's up homes, lemme get that
baseball from you real quick, aight?

Scare 'em.

That's stu...

Yeah...

I like that.

It's good, huh?

Yeah, I like it!

Yeah, 'cause that way they
don't know what's goin' on, bro.

I'll tell 'em I'm you know, coming
up with theÂ crew you know whatada...

Okay.
It's good, huh?

Alright, bro!

It's freaking good, shit. Yeah...

You ready for this?

Yeah, I'm ready.

We'll be fine. Let's go.

Here they come.

Dude, this is shady.

We'll be fine.

Hi, I'm Wade.

I thought you were a man.

How old areÂ you?

I'm eighteen.

Nice.

Bro. You wanna not scare 'em away?

Well you know I just don't wantÂ to
be doing business with no minor.

Lemme see the ball.

Money first.

Very well.

Ball of cash for a ball of base.

Are youÂ freaking kidding me?

Bro, can you stop embarrassing me?

Yo, you're embarrassing yourself.

Why would you say somethin' dumb like that?

Lemme see the signature.

Thank you.

Dude, how much did you get?

I don't know but it's
way more than I thought.

That's a fake.

It's a fake!

How do you know?
Because!

Let's get 'em!

Hey!

Get over here!

Hey, this is a fake!

I want my money back right now
or I'm callin' the cops, bro!

Why?

It's fake!

It's not fake!

Look at it!

Johnny! Johnny!

It's not real, it's fake.

It's not!

Hey!

Wade, start the car!

Go get him!

You get him!

Hurry up!

Unlock it, it's locked!

My bad!

Go, what are you doing!

Buckle up!

You!

You got lucky! You won't
get away with this!

Thanks for the help back there.

Was the signature fake?

No, it wasn't.

Okay.

I guess you could say the...

The guy I kicked back there
really dropped the ball.

Yeah, you could say that.
Get it?

Yeah, I get it.

Alright. See you man.

Later.

Hey.

Sorry for not believing you.

Thanks again.

Don't worry about it.

Don't tell my parents though, okay?

I won't.

I won't.

That was our first close call.

We couldÂ have got in some
real trouble back there.

In that moment, I didn't care whether that
ball's signature was authentic or not.

What mattered to me was that I had
quick money to finance the film.

AndÂ now it was time to get started.

Putting up flyers kept things local.

I just needed one more actor.

But other than that,

The Fraternal Tragedy was well underway.

You know, um...

You know I'm really gonna
miss you at college.

I'll miss you too.

I'm gonna be really lonely.

You could uh, find a lady.

Or maybe a dude.

Yeah for sure for sure.

So, I'll be shooting my next film soon.

Oh yeah?

Mhm.

I really think it's gonna be good.

Mmm.

You think I could try becoming a director?

I could go to film
school and focus on that,

and I'll be out of your way.

What is this now, Wade?

You don't want to help
with the store anymore?

You don't wanna get rich?

After you get this MBA, that's it.
We're set. We can expand.

I don't care about the money.

Plus Johnny says I have what it takes.

You think I love running
that place everyday?

I didn't have the
opportunity to go to college,

because of what happened to Mom and Dad.

Then why don't we sell the store?

WeÂ could go to college and we
both will have what we want.

We're not selling the store.

I might notÂ love the place,
but you know who I love?

Listen...

Going to film school
won't get you anywhere.

Neither will some business program.

It will if you work hard enough, and
you're a hard worker. I've seen it.

I could work hard to
become a director, then.

We don't even have the
money to send you there.

The scholarship for business
school can't be transferred.

Can't the life insurance
money pay for it then?

The life insurance, Wade?

How do you think we paid off this house?

Sure, our store is doing
pretty well right now.

But it could always grow, and
it can definitely always fall.

That's where you come in.

Why can't I just...

No.

I'm not gonna let you waste your
time or your smarts on film school.

Life is easy and set for
you from here on out.

Just take it.

From here we build what we were given.

Tim Burton says...

You shouldn't spend
your life making someone else's dreams.

Do you just sit around
looking at quotes all day?

I just wanna learn from the best.

And you will.

At business school.

Hey, when does your brother getÂ home?

End of the day so we're chilling.

And, got it.

Alright I downloaded theÂ auditions
already so it shouldn't take long.

How many were there?

Only three.

Three?

Yeah.

Damn, people are really
sleeping on this film.

You did mention on the flyer
that you're paying them right?

No.

Nice.

Let's just watch theÂ auditions.
Hey, uh

My name is John. And...

Mmmm. Nah...

That's not my real name. I was
gonna give you a fake name.

But...

Dr. Jill says I have to be
more honest now!

So I'm Cody and here's...

Anyways my name's Steve and here'sÂ my...

My scene.

Action!

You talkin' to me?

You talking to me?

Well who the hell else... you talking to me?

Casino.

And uh here's my...

My Mr. WickÂ if you know what I mean.

Action!

His Keanu impression is pretty good.

He'sÂ literally just
staring a bit off camera.

That's spot on though. And it works.

Yeah I guess.

Man I love that guy.

Next!

Huh. Next.

Hey what's up. I'm Tommy and...

Well I gotta beÂ honest I've
never really acted before,

But I'm kinda hoping this'll be my big break.
This guy looks pretty good.

I'm going to acting school in the fall...
Skip!

But I thought I'd join this production duringÂ the summer.
Wait, why?

He's not even doing a scene.

I actually think we went to the
same high school, right? Go Titans!

It's not about the acting ability.
It's about the personality.

Do you wanna be the director?

Alright. I'm just sayin'. It's your call.

Maybe. Let's just check out theÂ next
guy and we'll see from there.

Hey kid, remember me?

Guess what? Saw your littleÂ flyer
on my way home from work.

I'll never forget your
face and you know what?

You're gonna get what's comin' to you.

Gimme that.

Also your flyer is ugly!

I don't know why we laughed at that.

I guess Tommy's gonna be late.

So this is like the main area of the film?

Yup. Seems like a lethal
meeting place, you know?

You want another signature
incident to go down?

No.

The vibe here just fits the script.

Here he comes.

Hey!

Hey.

Okay, so, uh, you're Wade?

Mhm. I'm Wade Down.

Alright then.

You're Tommy, right?

Uh yeahÂ looks like it.

So uh how big is this film anyway?

I'm the crew.

Are you serious? How do you expect
this production to get anywhere?

At the end of the day
you're still getting paid.

You still getÂ a credit.

You're the actor, I'm the director and the
cameraman, DP, and so on. You get the idea.

Alright, so who's that over there?

That's Johnny.
I'm Johnny.

What's his job?

He's playing Kevin.
I'm playing Kevin.

Where is he going?

I don't know.

Why'd we get stuck with this guy?

ItÂ was your idea to hire him.

You agreed to it.

Well, he's who we gotta work with.

Let me see the script.

Sike! Great actors don't need scripts!

Well I don't know if you're a great actor.

And I'veÂ worked months on the script

So you're gonna use it.

Alright, alright, let's
justÂ pick up the script yeah?

Fine.

You all right?

Listen, I know Wade's a
little on edgeÂ right now,

and it's really complicated, but

it's his last chance to
do what he lovesÂ to do.

So let's just do it his way, okay?

Alright.
Okay, we cool?

Yeah.
Alright.

Wade, come here.

Yeah Wade, we're good now.

Alright. First filming day is Monday. Here.

SoÂ wear what you guys are
wearing and welcome aboard.

Tommy was right.

I was in over my head
tryingÂ to wear all those hats.

But I did my best.

That's me. That's me eighth grade.

That's you?

That's me eighth grade bro.

What's so funny?

Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it.

Cool, well are you guys ready then?

Yeah.
Yeah.

So Tommy you'll beÂ standing
there with your arms crossed.

Johnny, you'll be down that hill.
I'll tell you when to come up.

Alright.

And, action!

Wait Johnny!

Move further down.

Okay.

Is here good? Okay.
Yeah.

Action!

So what do we do now?

Didn't you read theÂ script?

Yeah.

So I want you to act out
the scene get a feel for it.

Well yeah IÂ know I'm
supposed to ask Johnny if...

Kevin.

Kevin... if he's the guy, but likeÂ how?
Like what's the timing?

Hold on.

Alright so I already got the wide shot.

SoÂ I'll cut to Johnny when he walks up.

And you guys can just improvise this scene.

And thenÂ I'll give you notes afterwards.
So yeah, just reset.

And... action!

So you're the guy?

No, I'mÂ just travel in
the middle of nowhere.

Yeah I get it I'm just saying
youÂ don't really look the part.

Oh yeah, I...

Well, sorry... Sorry guys I didn't
press record, so...

Come on, man. It's hot out.
But that was really good!

So let's just reset and do it again.

Make sure you press record this time.

Alright see you guys later.

Yeah good work today guys.

Thanks boss.

You know I've never actually
learnedÂ how to ride a bike.

Really?
Yeah

Yeah this is my only transportation.
I don't have a car, so...

Oh, neither do I. Guess I
gotta get a bike, right?

How far you have to walk?
I'm just waitingÂ for my ride.

Yo. Johnny.

Yeah what's up?

Here you go man.

Dude, come on, I don't need this.

It's cool dude. We have
enough in the budget, so...

You sure?

Yeah.

Alright. Thank you man.

No problem.

Hey Tommy do you wanna just wait inside?

You live here?
Yeah.

Why is your bike outside?

Oh, I was out and then I just saw
you walking up so I chased you.

Alright, let's do it.

How was your day?

Pretty good. We started filmingÂ today.

Mmm. How'd that go?

Good, but it was hot as hell.

There's absolutely zero shade in the hills.

The hills by Johnny's house?

Yeah why?

You gotta be careful out there.

If you got hurt and couldn't
call for help or if...

Chill.

No, Wade. You need to stay safe especially
if you're going to be out allÂ day.

If you're out with friends, I don't
want them suing us if they get hurt.

They wouldn't didn't do that.

Well,Â Tommy might.

Who's that?

He's one of our actors.

He's our age so don't worry about it.

I'm paying him too.

Uh, paid?

With what money?

I sold the signed baseball.

You're joking right? For
like what, five dollars?

It's worth more than that
it's a signed baseball.

Dude I'm sorry no that signature's fake.

Dad just told you it was real because the line
was way too long to get it actually signed.

Wait how much did you sell it for? Fifty?

More?

A hundred?

More.

What?!

Goddamn you should have beenÂ in
business this whole time.

The guys we sold it to knew it was fake.

And Johnny and I just ran.

I mean, I guess just stay safe, okay?

We're gonna do it Johnny. We're
sneaking in tomorrow night.

That's illegal bro.

It's just one scene. In, and out.
No problems.

I don't know...

Look. I haven't seen security
since the renovations.

So, we'll be fine.

So you in?

Do we have to?

Yeah.

Why can't we justÂ film it during
the day when the park's open?

Because I wrote the scene
for it to be at night.

Why can't we just make it during the day?

I said I wrote the scene at night, Johnny.

Fine. Is Tommy down?

Well he has to be.

I know Will was only trying to protect me, but I
needed to take some risks to get this film made.

That's why I couldn't give himÂ the
details of the scene just yet.

Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Right?

Hey you want some?
No thanks.

Uh, Will...

Yeah?

I'm gonna be out lateÂ tonight. For filming.

It's a night scene, so...

Alright. Well I'm gonna be
working lateÂ anyways so,

I just need you to be safe alright?

Okay.

Alright guys, now's the time.

Come on, hurry up let's just do it.

Let's go.

You guys memorized your linesÂ right?

Yeah.

So this should go by fast.

Damn it.

Dude let's just leave.
Yeah man let's just getÂ outta here.

No. Once he goes back we'll be fine.

Move out.

Hey man if this gets
sketchy I'm outta here.

Yeah me too.

Alright, let's do this.

Let's just hurry up.

Cut. Alright, we'll get theÂ reverse shot.
Same lines.

And, action.

Hey! Hey get over here!

Wade he's coming.
I know.

He ruined the shot. We have to do it again.
No Wade. We gotta go, man.

Action.
Dude no way!

Action!

You're the one that keeps trying
to pull me backÂ into this life.

I don't wanna do this anymore.

Then why did you come back?

Cut. Awesome, let's go!

Hey. Three kids just snuck into theÂ park.

I think they were filming something.

You think it was the kids those
weird guys reported? Over.

I don't know, man.

What's up?

Tired.

I see that. So what did you do today?

I uh, ran from security at the park.

You did what?

I don't have time for this right now.

You gotta stop doing all
this dangerous stuff Wade.

IÂ didn't get arrested. And
I didn't even get caught.

So relax.
And if you did...?

Shut up Wade.

This could haveÂ ruined our whole future.
Our future?

It was for the film.

I wanted a night sceneÂ at the park,
so I got a night scene at the park.

What you do for yourself
can affect me too Wade.

I'm not gonna cut any
corners for this film.

Just use common sense.

Got it.

That scene better be perfect.

This whole movie better be perfect if
it's worth risking that much to you.

It's the only thing I care about right now.

I know you like making films but why do
you wanna make a whole career out if it?

After mom and dad...

I realize how short lifeÂ can be.

So I wanna live it the right way.

This has been in me all along.

I just never thought I
could do it until now.

Seems like this movie's
gonnaÂ be pretty good.

Yeah I hope so. Wade's
been working pretty hard.

You trying to beÂ an actor too?

No, I've just known Wade a long time.

Really? Things seem kinda
weird between you two.

Uh... I don't know.

He kind of changed a few years back.

But I'mma stick with him.

We'reÂ pretty much like brothers.

So have you ever actually
met anyone from Wyoming?

Because I have this theory...
Yeah. I was born there.

No way.

Yeah I just... I don't remember too much.
I wasÂ pretty young.

Are you being serious?

Oh. There he is.

Hey Wade.

Hey guys, sorry for making you wait.

No, you're fine. We got here kinda early.

Sorry.

Come on, pick up.

What's wrong?
What's up?

You can't just take my camera, Will!

Mmm. No I'm sure I can.

I know it was a stupid idea to sneak
into the park butÂ it's over with.

I'm trying to be more professional
now and it's kind of hard to do that,

when my actors are waiting for me on set and I don't
haveÂ the most important thing. the most important thing.

I don't know. It soundsÂ like you're
unprofessional even with the camera.

You told me to make the perfect film.

And I'm trying to do that.

Where is it?

They're waiting for me Will.

Dude!

Wade, I'm busy here. It'sÂ in my closet.
Leave me alone!

Where are you guys?

Oh you got the camera?
Why didn't you call us?

I was driving.

Yeah, sorry.

Tommy had some stuff to do and I was
alone so I figured I would just go home.

Relax.

He told me to tell you he's sorry but he'sÂ free
to film all day tomorrow if you're down.

I mean I can too.

Alright. Sounds good.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

I'm not an idiot Han. You better give
me back the rest of my money or I'll...

Cut!

Okay. Be more emotional.

Show more anger.

I'm trying. I've just never
been super mad before.

Pretend like you got hit then.

Never gotten hit before.

Alright.

Dude don't do it.

Alright. Let's do that again.

Alright.

Action.

I'm not an idiot, Han!

Next time you take more of my money...

Ah, uh, okayÂ that was also good.

But this time a little bit less emotion.

Less angry.
Okay.

I'm not an idiot, Han. Next time you
take more than your share, I'll...

Just give me back the rest of my half!
Cut.

Let'sÂ try that again.

Sorry.

Action.

I'm not an idiot Han.

Next time you take more than your share I'll...
Cut.

Try again.

I'm not an idiot Han...

Alright let's try this one more time.

Action.

I'm not an idiot Han.

You better giveÂ me back the
rest of my shares or I'll...

Cut.

Are you even trying?

Dude what are you... Of courseÂ I am.

I just don't know why I
can't get this scene down.

I need you to get mad.

I need you to get angry mad.

Leo from The Revenant mad.

Dude I don't...

What do you want?

I don't... I don't know.

Don't hit me again.

I'm not gonna hit you again.

I'm trying my best.

I know.

It's not you.

We'll get it eventually.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

I guess...

I guess I'm just scared.

That the movieÂ isn't gonna
turn out how I expected it.

This is my last chance to prove
to everyone thatÂ I can do this.

Listen man, you've got serious talent.

You wrote a whole script by yourself.
You'veÂ written tons of them by yourself.

You're a one-man army trying to
make this whole dreamÂ come to life.

It's not supposed to be easy.
Yeah.

I do have the best friend I
could askÂ for helping me, so.

We're friends?

Yeah.

The sky's not really blue you know.

It's an illusion made
up of air and sunlight.

The same air we breathe.

The same sunlight thatÂ lets us see
the world for what it really is.

Blue's a weird color.

Come to think of it, Cobalt's
not really blue either.

At least not in its natural form.

Yeah I know.

We did the elements project
together in eighth grade.

Oh yeah.

Cobalt's kind of weird.

I mean it's used inÂ so many things
but too much of it is poisonous.

But you could say a lot
of things are like that.

Like drinking.

A lot of people drink alcohol and
it lets them loosen up, but...

too much of it and, you know
itÂ could really mess your life up.

You could even say it's like water.

We're made of water, but...

too much ofÂ that and you're
six feet underground.

Or six feet under water ifÂ you
wanna take it literally.

You could even say Cobalt's
kind of likeÂ dreams.

We spend our whole lives chasing them,

but at the end of the
road they justÂ consume us.

Turn us into different people.

Like dreams.

Shoot, what time is it?

I gotta go. I got work soon.

Hey do you know whereÂ I left my bike?

Yeah you lived in the side yard.

Why didn't you tell me you got a job?

I mustÂ have just forgotten, yeah.

That's cool dude. Gotta love a working man.

Eh, I mean I just needÂ some extra money for college you know.
Yeah.

Don't worry, we're still
focusing on the film.

You should get a job too.

Can't you work at your
parents'... yourÂ store?

Yeah, no I'm not gonna work there.

Um, so I'll see you tomorrow then?

No I can'tÂ I have an
orientation up in norcal.

And then I have work all day the next day.

So how aboutÂ the next day?

Yeah that can work, okay for sure.

Alright then, see you man.

Alright, see you.
Good luckÂ at work.

Thank you. Side gate's unlocked right?
Yep.

Like dreams.

What's up?

Hey Tommy. We're gonna cancelÂ filming
tomorrow and the next day.

Johnny just told me that he has some stuff to do
so we're gonna push back filming a couple days.

Yeah, he let me know.

Oh. Okay uh cool. Well I just
wanted to make sure, you know.

Got it boss. Have a goodÂ night.

Yeah you too man, thanks.

Like Will said, the film
needs to be perfect.

ThisÂ created a new drive in
me that I never had before.

It scared me.

It was my first mistake.

They say method acting consumes the soul of the actor
and transforms them into aÂ character they're playing.

Into someone they're not.

Apparently method directing
isn'tÂ really defined yet.

So I decided to try it.

Hey what's up Johnny?

Sorry,Â I'mma be a little late today.

That's cool. No worries, uh how come?

Can't findÂ my bike.

Oh... that's weird. Do you
need me to pick you up?

No, thanks though. I was...
I was just lettingÂ you know.

Okay, uh see you soon man.

See ya.

Okay.

Action.

Yeah I'm no idiot, Han.

You better giveÂ me back the rest
of my money or I'll kill you.

Just give me back the rest of my share.

Dude that was the best one yet. So close.

Damn it!

Was it good enough though?

Yes, but good enough isn't 'good enough.'

Please. I'm a little sick, too.

Better stay across that table then
because I don't wanna catch anything.

It's not contagious, don't worry.

Uh are you a doctor?

Exactly.

Are we done?

Yes.
Yes!

But let's run it back one
more time for variety's sake.

It's just one more.

Come on dude it's gonnaÂ be the same.

Just draw on how you felt...

when you found out your bike was stolen.

Wait, stolen?

Yeah you said you couldn'tÂ find it.

I never said it was stolen.

Well just assuming it was

ImagineÂ how it felt.

How it would feel.

Well, okay, you got this bro.

Remember, TheÂ Academy is watching, so.

Ready?

Okay.

Action.

I'm not an idiot.

You can't just take what'sÂ not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

but if we stray apart just
know it's because of you.

Oh my god.
How's that?

That's the one.

It wasn't exactly a part of the
script but it workedÂ even better.

Well I gotta go. I'm glad I could help you.

Do you need a ride?

Hey!

Maybe uh... maybe Tommy took it. Your bike.

Tommy doesn't even know how to ride a bike. But
since you brought it up youÂ want me to ask him?

I...
No no no no.

Obviously if you think he
took the bike, let meÂ ask him.

Well I don't mean...
Hey what's up Johnny?

Yeah. Wade here says you tookÂ my bike. Is that true?
Um. What?

I can't ride a bike. Remember?

Yeah, no I didn't think
you would have either.

He's trying to frame me? You know what?
Tell that dude I'm done.

Yeah, I don't blame you.
This whole film is a mess.

I didn't mean that.

Johnny. I'll help you find your bike.

Yeah sure you will!

I was late to workÂ 'cause I couldn't find that damn bike.
I'm sorry Johnny it was for this scene...

Do you know what it's like to get chewed out by your boss on your third day of your first job?
Like method acting!

I swear I was going to give it back!

By the way, Tommy's done with the film. So am I.
Don'tÂ just walk away, we're almost done with the film!

We're almost done with the film.

You think we overreacted?

No, I mean,

The guy'sÂ a vampire.

If we were younger I'd say sure,

make up and be all buddy
buddy again, but now?

I'm 18. I'm going to college soon.
Yeah, same.

See, you got to surround yourself with people who'll help you get places.
Yeah

How'd you do in school?

Not as good for how hard I tried.

Yeah I get youÂ there. How did Wade do?

Amazing actually, he's pretty smart.

And he wants to be a filmmaker? It's
not really fair to the rest of us.

Kind of a waste of talent.

I mean,

I get he was just trying to get the scene,

but to make me late to my realÂ job?

And to blame you for it?

Yeah I mean he's got
drive, I'll give him that.

Yeah but drive too much
and you eventually crash.

What?

Or run out of gas. I mean youÂ get
what I'm trying to say, like...

You good?

Yeah. Just practicing my acting.

Hey kid, remember me?!

How the hell did you guys
find me?

We followed you home from the park.
Dude that sounds creepy.

Oh yeah, we uh, uhÂ came from the gym?
Or uh I saw you walking, or?

That makes no sense.

What do you want?

You'reÂ gonna pay for what you did.

Cops are already on the way.

Where's your friend, huh?
Guess you'll do forÂ now.

And don't do nothing loco
homes 'cause I'm filming.

Already took my money!
Listen, I was just trying toÂ help a friend, I didn't...

Oh, the one who's not here!

You're outnumbered fool.
I swear I didn't knowÂ what to do.

Yeah well the cops will know what to do.
You got your pocket knife?

Nah homes, I left it at home.

Are you kidding me?

Nah homes, I thought...
The cops won't even care!

What do you guys want, money?

Nah fool, we did until you jumped us, see?

We don't play like that!

I'm not proud of what I did,
leaving Johnny likeÂ that.

It felt like a knife in my back
when I saw him with Tommy earlier.

And I thought leaving himÂ with those
guys would somehow pull out the blade.

But all I ended up doing
was stabbing him too.

Wade...

Wade what are you doing man?

I think I messed up.

What's going on?

I feel like I can't even
protect my ownÂ friends anymore.

I should have helped him.

Johnny?

I keep pushing everyone away.

You always got me.

You're not my friend.

Fine.

But I'm your brother and I'm hereÂ for you.

No you're not.
I'm trying to be

Johnny was more of a brother thanÂ you.

He always believed in
me, and now he hates me.

It's not that I don't believeÂ in you Wade.

I'm just trying to be real.

Real friends won't lie just
to make you feelÂ better.

You lie to yourself all the time.

Care to explain?

With your stupid master plan.

JustÂ let go of them Will. We
could have our own futures.

You know what Wade? I'm trying to be
a good bigÂ brother and help you out.

It is a stupid move to throw
away what's been given to you.

And if youÂ don't care about
what mom and dad wanted for us,

then you can get out of their house.

Who are youÂ to say what they wanted? You just want to keep the
store because the only part of them thatÂ still lives and breathes.

That store gave us everything.

And look at you. You're miserable.

AndÂ if I don't follow my dreams, a few
years down the line I'll be miserable too.

I'm not gonna lose youÂ too Wade.

We're gonna stick together.

Lucky for you that's
probably what's gonna happen.

No, it's luckyÂ for you.

I hope you got to live out
your dreams while you could.

Because summer's almost overÂ buddy.

Can't you see what you've been doing to me?

You planted this seed in my head that all
I'm good for is what's easy for me!
Get off me!

You don't know how hard
I've been working for this.

You don't know what I'm being putÂ through.

What you're being put through?

What about me?

We're the heirs of mom
and dad'sÂ liquor store,

But all it feels like I've inherited is a poison.
You want it so bad?

A poison that runs through my veins eating at my
insides knowing I'll never be able to do what I love.

You want it that bad?

Save me a seat at the Oscars, then.

Being a filmmaker doesn't mean I
have to win Oscars or become famous.

Plenty of people devote their lives
to it and make a fine living doing it.

Because they love it.
Maybe you're right.

I'm sorry.

And I'd do this whole thing myself.

But I don't have the time to go to college
or to study while I manage the store.

I need your help.

The way I see my future is with you beside me and
I'm sorry. It's just too late to change that.

You can always make films Wade.

You don't needÂ some
special school to do that.

I don't need business school
to own a store either.

ThatÂ degree will open
more opportunities for us.

We can start moving our way up.

There youÂ go with 'we' again.

'We' are brothers.

So yeah. We.

You might not like me,
and you don't have to.

But I'm gonna be there for you either way
because I made mom and dad a promise, okay?

When you were adopted, I promised them I
wouldn't let anything bad ever happen to you.

I might have gone too far, yeah.

But I can't go back on it now.

They'd be so disappointed in me right now.

No.

They always loved you Wade. No matter what.

I don't know what happened
between you and Johnny...

But if there's a way toÂ fix
it, you should at least try.

I'm not an idiot.

You can't just take what'sÂ not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

but if we stray apart just
know it's because ofÂ you.

How was that?

I'm not an idiot.

You can't just take what'sÂ not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

but if we stray apart just
know it's because ofÂ you.

How was that?

I'm not an idiot.

You can't just take what'sÂ not yours
and expect for nothing to happen.

Listen I'm not gonna make
you return what's mine,

but if we stray apart just
know it's because of you.

How was that?

Hey man.

Hey.

So how's life?

Police literally detainedÂ me the other day.

Honestly I'm just glad I wasn't arrested.

For what?
Those creeps youÂ sold the ball to...

They found me and they
called the cops on me

because I was beating
themÂ up, trying to defend you.

But I helped too.
Do you really wanna be in my situation rightÂ now Wade?

Sorry.

Anyways I just froze, I didn't...

It's all your fault too.

How is it my fault?

That ball you sold them.
The signature was fake.

The things you do for
yourself hurt otherÂ people.

Yeah I know I heard that before.

Anyways, I need your help.

Listen, if I don't make this
film, no one will believe in me.

I know what I did...

I know what I did was messed
up and I only had one chance.

And I blew it.

I was just so focused on the film, I didn't
think of anything else.

And I'm sorry.
Listen, I've been making good steps for my future.

I can't go backwards right now and it just
feels like you're pulling me that way.

And I'm happy for you.

It's just I wanna get to that place too.

But I really need your help to get there.

So all I could ask is...

All I could ask, is are you in?

How many more scenes are there?

IÂ cut out a bunch so there's
only one more scene left.

Okay. I'll do it. One more scene.\

Tommy won't though.

What do you mean he won't?
I've been paying him.

I guess he just doesn't take any of your crap.
Just make a contract next time or something.

I've beenÂ dealing with his crap all this time,
and now he doesn't care about the movie?

It's fine. I can take your buddy out of it anyways.
Whatever, Wade.

Remember what you told me
at the beginning of summer?

What?

Don't confuse pity with love.

Uh.

Where's my drink?

Oh, what'd you want?

Will..
Um,

Soda.

Please. Thanks.

There you go.

Will.

William.

Thank you. Thanks.

So...

How does your movie end?

I never thought I would hear him say that.

TheÂ truth was I had to get out so much of the
script that my original ending was already ruined.

But I had to finish this.

And win Johnny back.

No more lies.

No more stealingÂ or scamming
my way through this.

I had to do something the right way.
For once.

Before I could do that, I felt
like I had to change myself.

Nice hair.

Thanks.

So uh you ready?

Yeah let's just get this over with.

Alright.

I brought some watersÂ for when it gets hot.
Hold up.

School's calling. I'll be back.

I had no idea what was coming.

For some reason, I kept thinking about
that speech Johnny gave me in the backyard.

Yo Johnny what happened?

Johnny what happened?

Leave me alone.

What did they say?

Johnny.
Go away.

What?

I'm done!

Johnny just tell meÂ what happened.
I got kicked out!

From Berkeley?

My admission was rescinded!

I'm so sorry.
And it's allÂ because of your stupid scam!

They found out about the
whole deal with the cops.

Apparently now that'sÂ on my record!

Johnny just tell me what happened that day.

Those freaks from the park followed
meÂ and then called the cops on me!

You already told me that but what did the cops do?
There was only one cop!

I told him about the whole thing
with your ball after he handcuffed me

but he let me go so IÂ thought I was fine.

You know what?

Take your stupid scam money!

I didn't know this would happen. I'mÂ sorry.

I didn't even know the ball was
fake until Will told me... Dude!

Hey, hey, hey!

How many times do I have to sayÂ I'm sorry?

My dreams are over Wade.

How am I gonna tell my parents about this?

They'reÂ gonna kick me out.

I don't... I don't know, Johnny.

I don't.

I could try calling them butÂ that
would probably make things worse.

You can bounce back from this.
We just need to figure things out.

My dreams have been over since before I
could even recognize them.

You must have seen it.

I don't even know why you believed inÂ me.
Because brothers believe in each other

But now I see that we were never brothers
so I don't know why I believed in you.

You believe in Tommy don't you?

He's going toÂ acting school isn't he?

He didn't even want to use my script!

You wanna know what I toldÂ Tommy
the first day we met him,

when he was being a complete jerk to you?

I told him this was theÂ last chance
for you to do the one thing you loved,

and that we have to do things your way!

I know theÂ messed up things
that got you to this point Wade.

But you shouldn't drag me down with you.

I'mÂ stupid for thinking this film would get
me anywhere. All it did is blow up my face.

In yourÂ face?

You know what Wade, fuck you!

Johnny.

I saw those weirdos stop
you on the street the other day.

Johnny I'm sorry.

Hey...
Johnny!

I remember this lens is prettyÂ expensive right?
Don't!

Why would you do that?!

I wouldn't have sold the stupid baseball
if I knew it would do this to you.

I know it's like losing
a future too, Johnny.

Life took away my family, and put me in a
situation where I can't even do what I wanna do.

I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

I need you!

We were brothers!

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry!

Hey Will.

I think you should call your
brotherÂ right now. He needs you.

I finally reached the conclusion
of my own fraternal tragedy.

I was done.

Freed from my curse to make this film.

But... it cost me a friend.

I called Johnny's college and
explained to them what happened, but

he's stillÂ waiting on his appeal.

He deserves so much.

And I took everything from him.

Anyway, thatÂ was my summer.

I love you Mom. I love you Dad.

I won't be able to visit forÂ a while...

Because of school.

But, um...

Anyway.

I finally understand what Johnny meant
when he said dreams are like cobalt.

Some of us unwillingly inheritÂ dreams
that the world wants to kill.

When we decide to follow them anyways,

too much passion can consume us...

poisonÂ us...

until we become the
villain of our own story.
