People tell me about my greatness

They want to know howl got here

As I look back on my life. there have
been so many twists and turns,

The people who celebrate me now can't

really understand where I come from

All I can remember is
that we were very poor

Our home was a small nipa hut

The roof and walls were made Of leaves
from a coconut tree

Our house stood there - where
the small coconut tree now stands

That was where our house was

That was before, now it's gone

SO QhaUS it...
it brings back memories

My mom Â£00k care of us
because my father wasn't around

All Of my siblings worked
and looked for jobs

so we could survive and eat

Sometimes we would go
days without eating

There! They started
to pull in the fishnets

At (he crack Of dawn, our mother
would wake us up to pray the rosary

We would pray to the Lord

"What kind of life will we have
when we grow up?"

We had nothing

Then we would look for work

<i>I</i> would go fishing

I spoke to the owner of a fishing net
and asked if I could help

so I can have a share of the fish

At first, they were hesitant, because
I was too young, and what do I Know'?

They gave me a chance because I was
desperate and really needed (he job

And we needed to eat

Then I had a catch

I had a share of the fish,
and then I sold half.

Then I brought (he other half home
for us to eat

Manny was the first person <i>I</i> trained

Even without shoes, he jogged

And <i>I</i> saw in him, his passion

I also saw they didn't have money
to send him to school

That's why I trained him

These were the first gloves Manny used

when I started to teach him boxing

When he used them

he was only 12 years old

These are the memories

that he will never forget

n was Manny and I

The two of us looked for ways
to get out of poverty

I was really surprised
I received a letter saying,

"I'm already in Manila mom."
I cried

But Manny said. "if I asked for
permission to go to Manila

you will never permit <i>n</i> "

"I'm sorry mom but
I'm earning a living here

so we can get out of our poverty"

"My perseverance isn't just for me

this is for all of us"

I asked, are you boxing
there in Manila?

"Oh, we're here in Malabo mom

we live here at the gym"

I want (O greet my fellow men
in General Santos City

I wish you all well.
<i>I</i> know that you miss me

<i>I</i> already won here

I thank you for your support
and your prayers.

Because of you, <i>I</i> won by knockout

Thanks to all of you who supported me

Especial)!e my mom and
my girlfriend, Jinkee Jarnora

My mom. my dad. my siblings.
all my loved ones

To all my fans.
please don't lose hope

I was pregnant during his fight
in Antipolo.

That was my first experience
to see him fight

They wanted me to leave because

<i>I</i> was e months pregnant

At first, my uncle asked,

"How can a boxer be capable
of supporting you?"

But I thought it through carefully and
prayed to God

that he's really the one for me

After we got married. I went
to practice with him every day

<i>Good combination there by
Manny Pacquiao and a left</i>

Michael: Just make sure I
get (he money

You will get your money.
you have Bob's backing

Michael That's right

<i>men!</i>

<i>men Surrender new!</i>

<i>men!</i>

<i>men!</i>

<i>men!</i>

Of course, when you're famous,
many want a picture or autograph

but that's how it is

Because when you have fans it's also
important that you are nice to them

Of course we also know that
they are also instrumental

of course it's hard but

I'm able to manage

Really... this was the
hardest fight of my life

It can't always be like this

You know...
I've had many boxing fights, but

I didn't think
it would be this hard

NOW how in (he hell YOU beat
a guy at 150 pounds,

that can fight way better than the guy
you was fighting at 105 pounds')

n ain't no way possible

The allegation is

They're trying to ruin my. my.
my name in boxing

Of course there are a lot of things
you are obliged to do

But son-sometimes I wonder can I do this?
Can I really take this?

We wish you all the best of luck

against Juan Manuel Marquez
for the third time

Did you read the bill?

We can't go without Jinkee

Bob Arum: Be calm.
because <i>I</i> promise you

<i>I'll</i> bring the fight back in May

Bob Arurn: And we'll do it again.
We'll do it again!

He inspires the young DeoDle
because he came from nothing

He didn't have a name before

Then he became one of the biggest men
here in our country, in (he world

As long as he wants to fight again,
he can do both,

because he still has his potential

But he can also be used in the
ministry, because of his influence

Like what happened to me
in my last fight

<i>I</i> prayed <i>I</i> believed 100%

that <i>I</i> would win, <i>I</i> prayed

<i>But what happened m me')?</i>

You saw the result

But I was not sad

Because what is important to me
is my relationship with God

Before I could not resist the devil

When sexy ladies would pass

My eyes would follow them

But now that <i>I</i> have a strong spirit

I feed my spirit.
lam blind to other women

But the only and most beautiful woman
that <i>I</i> keep my eyes on is my wife
