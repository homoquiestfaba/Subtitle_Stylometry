Have you ever been
to the governor's mansion?

Don't be
ridiculous.

That'll be a $1.75.

What're you doing
after work?

Flying my private jet
to the Bahamas.

Really?
I got a place there.

Sure you do.

(MUSIC STOPS)

LYNN: Pretty little place
right on the beach.

Could I give you
a little advice?

You need to work on
your pick up line.

No one's gonna believe that you
live in the governor's mansion.

Not a chance.

You don't think so? You
have any suggestions?

Well, I don't know. Let me
see, maybe something like...

BANDIT: I'm sorry, I
forgot to pay for my beer.

No, I think we need
something better than that.

What do I owe you?

For what?

For the beer.

I took a beer off of your tray
and I didn't pay you for it.

Oh, don't worry,
it's on the house.

Thank you, that's real nice. I suppose
a five ought to cover that, then.

I'm Becky.
Becky Winters.

Nice to meet you, Becky.

And you are...

Bandit.
Bandit?

Yep, that's what
they call me.

Bandit?

I thought you were going to
give me some suggestions.

Honey, I suggest you
take a lesson from him.

I don't know how
you do it, Bandit.

Every time you
walk into a room

every beautiful woman
turns to look at you.

You know I got
the rig outside.

Well, you still haven't
told me where we're going.

I know.

Hi, Bandit, we're going
to the lake tomorrow.

You want to come with us?

Wow. Cindy,
I would love to,

but, you see, I have something
else that I got to take care of.

Sorry, darling.

You expect me to get up
at the crack of dawn,

sneak out of my house,
meet you on the highway,

head off for some
unknown destination

for who knows how long
or for what reason

without any explanation
from you?

Yes.

If my dad finds out,
I'm dead.

Lynn, don't worry
about the governor.

You're gonna be back before
he even knows you're gone.

Shut your mouth!


Hey! Hey! Hey! Buddy, we
don't want any trouble here.


(MUSIC STOPS)

(MUSIC RESUMES)

Bandit!

Thanks.


(RECORD SKIPS)

(WOMEN SCREAMING)

What time tomorrow?

We'll be on the road
by about 6:00 a.m.


(RECORDS SKIPS)

Am I gonna be
home for supper?

Absolutely, buddy.

(MUSIC RESUMES)

(RECORDS SKIPS)

You ever been to the
governor's mansion?

(ALL CLAMORING)

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Need a ride home?

Oh, man, thought
you'd never ask.

BANDIT: You want me to drive?

WOMAN: No, I can handle it.
BANDIT: Okay.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(SINGING UPBEAT COUNTRY SONG)

(ALARM RINGING)


Lamar. Beautiful morning,
isn't it?

I'd love to stay and chat,
but I really gotta go.

Where are you going?

TO Play golf.

You forgot your clubs.

they're in the car, okay.

Listen, the last time you
ran off with the Bandit,

your daddy had my
hindquarters for breakfast.

Bandit? What makes you think I'm
running off with the Bandit?

Now, that is his rig parked
behind the greenhouse.

I saw it on
my early morning rounds.

You know, Lamar, you've done some great
detective work, but I've gotta go.

Yeah, thank you.

Wait a minute! What am I going to
tell your daddy, the governor?

(PHONE DIALING)

(PHONE RINGING)

(PHONE RINGING) Hold on, Lynn.
Hold on, I'm coming.

Hello, you've reached Bandit, live.
You're on the air.

Not only am I on the air,
I'm also on the road.

That's more than
I can say for you.

What are you talking about, buddy?
Of course, I'm on the road.

You're never on the road when
you say you're gonna be.

<i>You gonna tell me
where we're going yet?</i>

And take all the mystery out of it?
Why would I do that?

I'll see you when
you get there. Bye.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(POLICEMEN CHATTERING)

POLICEMAN: What's he doing?
Look out!

Oh, damn, I haven't even had
my first cup of coffee yet.

I'll drive.

(SIRENS WAILING)

Good morning, boys.
Looking good.

Rookie, that's a damn good
way to lose your job.

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

(SIRENS WAILING)

(ENGINE STARTING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(BANDIT LAUGHING)

Goddamn, you boys
are getting better.

Two things I hate
are Mondays and rookies.

(ROMANTIC COUNTRY
MUSIC PLAYING)


(TRUCK HORN BLARING)

What took you so long?

Still don't want to tell ol' Lynn
what this is all about, huh?

Did I ever tell you
about my hometown?

It's quiet, peaceful little
corner of paradise, buddy.

You haven't been home
for five years,

now all of a sudden, you
got to be there right now,

today,
this afternoon, urgent.

Did I mention
beautiful women?

What are we waiting for?


Say, as hot as that engine is, I'd say
you've been here about 45 seconds.

Buddy, that's 45 seconds
too long. Let's go.

Let's do it.

Poor boy. Code 12.

Code 12?

BANDIT: About dead ahead,
up half a mile.

I'm gonna have to catch up
with you later, son.

I thought you were
in a big hurry.

Ah, but never in too much of a
hurry to help someone in need.

How you doing there?

Okay, so where
you headed?

North. Where does it
look like I'm heading?

Hitch-hiking huh? It's a little
dangerous these days, wouldn't you say?

How about I just drop
you off at a bus station?

You do know how to drive
a car, don't you?

So, you just slip this car in
gear and give a little gas.

North it is.

(CAR REVVING)

TEACH: I told you
this was a bad idea.

I told you we should have
got a real pilot,

but, no, you had to come up with
this retired bank truck driver.

Oh, he's a certified flyer.

He's your cousin!

He's my cousin
and a certified flyer.

TEACH: He's your cousin
with a learner's permit!

I'm telling you he'll get us
to the concert safe and sound.

I keep seeing my life
flashing before my eyes.

And it isn't
a pretty sight!

Bread man, will you explain
to this unbelieving Thomas

that everything's
under control.

May day! May day!
We're going down.

TEACH: We're going down?

Bandit, you got
your ears on?

"Bandit?"

Yeah, that's my name.
Bandit.

What other hideous things
did your parents do to you?

You know, you could use
just a little bit of work

in the social graces
department there, little lady.

Screw you.

I take it back. You could
use a lot of work.

Bandit, you there?

Yeah, I'm here.
Go ahead, Poor boy.

Take a look at them
Flying Wallendas up there.

<i>The way that plane's smoking I'd
say they could use a little help.</i>

Do you know how
to drive a car?

In my sleep.

Good, well let's see
how you do awake.

I was happy teaching, "Good morning
children," and I could've stayed with it.

But, no, not me. I had to go
into management and travel.

<i>WOMAN: Hold it steady, Poor boy.
Bandit's coming aboard.</i>

MEL: All you do is
look at the negative.

Why don't you try to look at the
good side of things for a change?

We have an idiot for a pilot.
We are gonna crash and die!

Will you please tell me what the
good side is to this situation?

Jeez, take
a look at that.

Look! Oh, look.

(MEN CHATTERING)

MEL: You see? Now, sometimes
you just have to face...

You just have to face and look on
the positive side for a change.

TEACH: Look out, this is
not even the passing lane.

BREADMAN: Will you stop
hollering in my ear?

(BREADMAN EXCLAIMING)

MEL: I told you. He
knows what he's doing.

TEACH: He sees the tree?

MEL: Of course, he sees the tree.
Do you think he's blind?

BREADMAN: What tree?

(TEACH SCREAMING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)


Come on, Bandit.
Bring him on in, buddy.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

TEACH: No, no!

<i>N'), â€œb, no'.!</i>

Yeah!


Cool.

All right!

One of these has
your name on it, Bandit.

Look, I've got to get
Mel Tills to this concert.

I mean,
it's urgent.

I mean, people
are depending on it.

Are you sure you don't have anything
that moves, that has wheels,

a tractor, a trailer,
a truck, anything at all?

I'll make it worth your while, sir.
How about a hundred bucks?

No.

They'll take care of the pilots.
We're on our way. Bandit.

Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

I thought you were
in a hurry.

Never in too much of a hurry to help
someone in need. Excuse me, buddy.

So, Mel Tills,
he's a pretty big star.

He must really
rake it in.

What does he take in, like
50, 50 grand for a day?

Yeah, something like that.
Look, if you'll excuse me...

$50,000! That's... I can't imagine
making that kind of money.

Sometimes we make more.

I booked him into
Las Vegas last year,

and we got 120 grand.

$120,000!
That's a lot of money.

Of course, you don't make
that kind of money

without great management.
Of course.

Hey, Teach. You don't have to
worry about the Breadman anymore.

He's gonna be okay.

Melvin, please, I'm busy.

You see, so it seems to me
that it'd be worth your while,

maybe worth more than
a couple of hundred bucks

to get you
to the airport.

How much more?

Oh, say half?

What are you
talking about?

Half?

I get you to the airport, I
drive 200 miles out of my way,

and yes, you give me
half of what he makes.

Half of everything,

or half of what
comes out of his pocket?

His pocket.
That's a deal.

(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)
Great.

Now we got to get there
for the sound check.

No problem.
Thank you.

What are you
talking about?

Trust me.

What the hell
are you doing?

Trust me. I got us
a couple of passengers.

Hey! Wait for me.

Oh, you know it's...

I'm not gonna be going north
anymore, it's more like east now.

That's even better.
I mean, it's west.

Hey, I'm Easy.

Oh, boy, if you're easy, I
don't want to see difficult.

Well, we can't just leave
her on the highway.

BANDIT: No, no, we couldn't. That wouldn't
be fair to the unsuspecting motorists.

Lynn, I'd like you
to meet...

I'm sorry,
what was your name?

I told you, I'm Easy.

Easy?

Yeah, where do I ride?

Gentlemen.

Right this way, ma'am.

Look at these wheels.

Oh, this is great.

That way we'll go to
the fat cattle show.

What fat cattle show? Get
these in here. Come on.

LYNN: So, hey, you ever been
to the governor's mansion?

TEACH: We're never gonna
make the 12:00 noon flight.

There's another one
at 2:30.

All right. Well, I've got
to drop the rig off,

I've got to see a certain
party about a small matter,

and we'll be
on our way.

You called my cousin
an idiot.

Well, you see,
if we make the 2:30,

we'll get there in plenty of
time for the sound check.

Piece of cake.

You insult my cousin,

Tills, the whole Tills...

All of us.

Melvin, your cousin
is an idiot.

I mean, that is not
an insult, it is a fact!

That does it.
Step outside!

Step outside! We're in a
moving car, for God sakes.

Would you please say something?
Do something!

BANDIT: You shouldn't have
insulted his cousin.

Just tell him that
you didn't mean it.

I didn't mean it.

There, he says
he didn't mean it.

And promise you'll
never do it again?

And he says he'll never do it again.
Come on now.

EASY: Do you guys
always act this weird?

Yeah, pretty much.

Cool.

You shouldn't insult people's families.
You should know better.

Just drive.

<i>And this promises to be the biggest
founder's day celebration ever.</i>

<i>One hundred years of tradition
tied up in a ribbon.</i>

<i>And speaking of ribbons, let's
have a big round of applause</i>

<i>for our lovely
Miss Bear River winners,</i>

<i>from the south, Tami.</i>

(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

<i>And from the north, Marcy.</i>

(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

<i>And coming up,
the bare knuckles contest,</i>

<i>the crackshot
competition.</i>

<i>And don't forget our grand
finale parade through town.</i>

<i>We've got line dancing, we got
marching bands, we got everything...</i>

(HORN BLARING)

<i>What's this? I've just been
told that at this very moment,</i>

<i>that our very own
local legend, the Bandit,</i>

<i>is making
a surprise visit home.</i>

<i>Let's get on over there and give him
</i> a <i>big o!' country welcome home!</i>

(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

Where'd all these...

...all these people
come from?

Well, they're family mostly.
Believe it or not.

At least half of them.
The half that like us.

What about
the other half?

Well, hopefully we won't
be here long enough

for them to do us
too much harm.

What is this, some kind
of circus of the geeks?

Have a little respect
for tradition, will ya?

<i>The crackshot competition
is coming up.</i>

<i>You better get over there
for the drawing.</i>

<i>In the meantime, the bare
knuckles contest is underway.</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Excuse me, boys.

Bandit! Oh, you
sweet-smelling, fast-talking,

good-looking hunk of man,
come here, hug my neck.

Oh, great to
see you, Patsy.

PATSY: You are a sight
for sore eyes.

Yes, it's been a long time.
You're looking fine there, woman.

Well, Lord knows
there's plenty to look at.

BANDIT: Sure is.

Well, well, well.
What we got here?

A twin pack.

BANDIT: Yes, as a matter of fact,
these are two friends of mine

and I was
wondering, Patsy,

if you could keep these two boys
occupied for about five minutes

while I go pay a visit to
an old friend over there.

PATSY: You know I can.

Doreen, incoming.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Beth.

Wow, I'm really happy
to see you.

I was kind of thinking
you'd be mad at me.

You look more beautiful than
ever, if that's possible.

Beth! Beth! Nice to have
the Bandit back, huh?

Hey, I think that went pretty well.
Hey,cous.

Pretty well? Pretty well?
You call that pretty well?

You specifically said
she wanted to see me.

I did?

You lied to me
to get me back here.

Never. I told you we needed your rig
to get the bear out of the woods.

You knew that if you told me she
wanted to see me, I'd come back.

You're mad.

You got the rig if you need it.
I've got another job to do.

Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you're gonna just walk away

and let her marry
"Big Sky" Olsen?

You know, if she
wants to marry him,

I'm not going
to stop her, again.

She doesn't want
to marry him.

Oh, now, see, see?
How could you know that?

She wouldn't have
told you that.

Would she?

Yes.

Yes?

In a roundabout way.
Yes.

Oh, boy, I know I'm going to
regret this in the morning.

I just know it.

Son, city life's
made you too serious.

Let's go get some of us
some Patsy's home cooking.

All right.
Have you seen Jennifer yet?

She went up the highway
to look for you.

No, I haven't.
Wonder where she is.

Jennifer, do you
have to go back?

Oh, Jason,
you know I do.


Jennifer.

Jennifer.
Hey, I've got to get home.

I know. I know you
got to be home by noon.

It's already noon.

Just five more minutes.

Listen, Bandit'll be there, and
they'll be wondering where I am.

Yeah, what are you
going to tell them?

That I've been hugging and
kissing on Jason Russell

from the wrong side
of the tracks.

Somehow I don't think they're
gonna see any humor in that.

I love you.

Bye!

(UPBEAT COUNTRY
MUSIC PLAYING)

Patsy, this is good food.

And I'm not just saying it.
It's really good.

But now for the bad news, Melvin
and I have a plane to catch.

Not before the
crackshot competition.

Crackshot competition?

Yeah.

First the crackshot
competition, then the bear.

Bear?

You said this was
gonna be one quick stop.

It is.

You're right, Bandit, this town
is a little bit of paradise.

What did I tell you, buddy?

<i>The crackshot competition
is comin' up!</i>

<i>You better get over there
for the drawing!</i>

Let's go.
TEACH: Oh!

Bandit!

Jennifer, I've been looking
all over for you, cousin.

<i>It's so good
to see you!</i>

Perfect, it wouldn't be
Dogpatch without Daisy Mae.


Look at you.
Look at my little Dimples.

Nobody calls me
that anymore.

How come?
You all grown up, huh?

Hey, come on.
The crackshot competition.

You want to stop and
get some food first?

I'm not hungry.

Ah, so loss of appetite, a smile
wider than the great outdoors,

and we're losing
track of time.

I'm thinking we're in love,
aren't' we?

Stop it. Now come on.

I'll catch up with you later on.
Good to see you.

<i>Patsy tells me
we have the winners</i>

<i>in the crackshot
competition drawing.</i>

<i>It's world famous country
music singer Mel Tills</i>

<i>and his New York
manager, Teach!</i>

Look, I am not going to ride on the back
of some contraption through a field

while men who have nothing
better to do with their time

take pot shots at me.
I'm not doing that.

Are you trying to
welsh on a draw?

to welsh on a draw.

But unfortunately,

Melvin and I have
other things to do.

As well the Bandit can explain.
Band it? Band it?


Melvin,

lam never going with you anyplace
again as long as I live.

Which...

(IN SING-SONG) Which
might not be that long.

Let's go.
Whoa!

(HORSE NEIGHING)


(GUN COCKING)

Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Beth, Beth!
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)


I know we got off
to a bad start earlier.

I just want to talk.

There's nothing
to talk about. Get out.

Beth, marrying Jake Olsen would be
the biggest mistake of your life.

I don't see how this is any of
your business, anyway. Leave.

What are you gonna do? You gonna shoot me?
I don't think so.

Let me have the rifle,
Beth, please.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

Good aim.

I was aiming for you. You
want to risk another shot?

Beth, Beth, you're gonna regret
this the minute I leave.

Five minutes. You don't have five
minutes you can't spare to hear me out?

It could be the most important five
minutes of your whole life, Beth.

You have the gall to tell me
that five minutes with you

would be the most important
five minutes of my life?

Well, it could be.

You don't know
unless you try it.

Out!

All right!
Take it easy! Beth!

Listen if you want
to talk to me,

you'll find me at the
festivities, all right?

Now, that's not fair. Have you been
practicing since I've been gone?

I'm not going to leave this town
until we work this out, okay?

(ENGINES REVVING)

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

(GUN COCKING)


Let's fly to the concert!

"My cousin's a pilot."


"It'll be fun!"

It was you who drew...

It was you who...
It was you who drew the

...stick.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Well, that's it for
the North</i> Bear <i>River team.</i>

<i>Better luck
next year, guys.</i>

<i>Now let's reload and see how
the South Bear River guys do.</i>

How does this look?

Who cares!


What is this? Some kind of male
rite of passage or something?

Great smile, spitfire.

What?

You got a great smile.
I like it.


(GUN COCKING)

Jake Olsen, I thought I told
you to put that rifle away.

You want to spend the rest
of your life in prison?

Ain't nobody worth that.

I'm only going to do
what I got to do, Ma.

Shh!

Did you get that little thing
I asked you to?

Yes.

It was your great
grandmama Olsen's.

But I still don't see how you're
going to marry that girl from jail.

Don't tell me how to
do my business, Ma.

Don't you sass me, boy.

Hey. Oh, no, no, no.
Not so fast.

Hey, you have
any luck?

Any luck?
She shot at me.

Did she hit you?
No.

Then she wasn't serious.

What do you mean
she wasn't serious?

She shot at me.
She could have hit me.

But she didn't. I'd say
that's a good sign, son.

Good, I'm out of here.

No, wait, wait.
You can't leave.

I can't leave.
Watch me.

No, we need your rig
to get the bear.

I see. You don't need the
rig to get the bear!

'Cause you're not going to get the bear.

You never have
and you never will.

Forget the bear!

You might
as well tell him.

The boys found the bear.

Yes.

No way.

Bear?

Oh, this is great.

Listen, the last thing I need right
now is a little lip from you, okay.

So, cut it out,
city slicker.

Bear! Ooh.


What is he, some kind of good
luck symbol or something?

You're kidding.
I was just guessing.

Johnny Bruce and the boys
found the hiding place,

snuck right in underneath their
noses and took it out of there.

Fifty years we've been
trying to find that bear.

You actually
found the bear?

That's why we needed
you to come home.

I don't believe it.
You got the bear.

Yes. But we need to
bring it back to town.

I guess that's where
you come in, slick.

I got the picture.
But thank you.

We really need
your help.

Look, this has been, may I say a
lot of fun, but can we go now?


So, I guess you won
the drawing.

We have one more thing to take care of
and then we'll finally be on our way.

What now?

We got to see a man
about a bear.

Oh, no!

Yeah, J.B. is gonna tell
you about the whole thing.

Now, get yourselves
cleaned up, huh?

Come on. Yeah.


Patsy, you got to tell me
the truth, here.

Always.

Is she really thinking
about marrying Jake?

The Wedding's taking place
right after the parade.

Whoa, whoa. What? Why
didn't you tell me that?

You didn't ask.

I mean, his people have already
made all the arrangements.

I mean, they've even decorated up
the old saw mill for the ceremony.

The saw mill?

He's gonna marry her
at the saw mill.

Tradition!

I mean Jake's daddy married
Jake's ma at the saw mill.


I'd say this is about
your last chance.

What you going to do?

Get the bear.

Talk to Beth.

Get married.


What else can I do?

Atta boy!

See ya.

<i>We'll have some dancing and music
and a whole lot of down-home fun,</i>

<i>before our annual parade
through town.</i>

<i>So, put on your dancing shoes
and hang around.</i>

Let's go on down there
and arrest them.

Without the goods?

We lose them now, we may never
catch 'em with the goods.

Then let's not
lose them.

First we get the bear,
then we get the Bandit.

Well?

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

MEN: Whoa!

Son, I kind of like that little
spitfire you brought along.

Oh, J.B. You're not serious.
Come on, now.

Nah, she's got some style.

Style?

I tell you what I wanna
know is who's the...

Who's the young man in little
Jennifer's life there, huh?

What do you mean?

Oh, come on now, cousin. You can can the
innocent expressions with me, buddy.

Who is it?

Well, if you want to say something
to me, just say it in English.

You haven't noticed?

Noticed what?

She's all moony-eyed, her
cheeks are flushed. Come on.

Allergies.

LYNN OVER RADIO:
Breaker, for <i>Bandit.</i>

Yeah, go ahead.
What you got, Poor boy?

<i>Unexpected guests
at our back door.</i>

BANDIT: Huh, is that enemy forces
from across the river or what?

LYNN: <i>I don't think so.
One car. No decorations.</i>

<i>Looks like
government boys.</i>

J.B.: They're after me.

God damn!

Sorry.

But unless you want to
see me do some hard time,

you'd better lose them
in the woods.

I don't believe this.

Lynn, you just keep
heading along there

until somebody stops you,
and you...

I don't know, tell them
I'll be there shortly.

The stuff is
leaving the road.

Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

They've got the stuff with them.
The truck is a decoy.

No, we don't know that.

We can't lose
Johnny Bruce.

KEYES: I don't see them.
Where the hell did they go?

They're behind us!

Okay. Okay.

Damn!

What should I do?

WILSON: We're going
after Johnny Bruce.

Now I'm in charge.

I thought you
promised me

you were going to get out of the
shine business, didn't you?

I know, I did.

Now, did I or did I not tell you
I was not gonna come back here

and help you out ever again unless
you got rid of the stills, J.B.?

Yes, yes, you did.

Well, what then?

Blue bird,
three o'clock.

Four o'clock.

Now maybe
it's six o'clock.

Hold on.

Don't back off.

Are you nuts?
Don't back off!

KEYES: You get us killed,
we have no case!

WILSON: Back out of here.
Stay with him.

Where did you
learn to drive?

I ought to bring them right
to the stills right now.

You watch me,
I'll do it!

There are no stills.


Well, I got rid of them,
just like you asked me to.

Then who are these guys
following us?

Got me
a new business.

Which is?

Doing pretty well.

BANDIT: You want to tell me what
this new business is about?

It's a little
boutique business.

Yeah, consisting of?

Just me.

And some very highly
marketable products.


WILSON: Watch out
for that tree!

KEYES: Which one?

Great piece of driving. I'll
make sure it gets in my report.

Hey, you wanna
drive, drive.

We've lost them.

Get on the phone
and call for a wrecker.

Hey, where are
you going?

To turn in my resignation.

You're a disgrace
to the agency.

(m. LAUGHING)

Good work.


Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)
Talk to me, son.

We've got a date
with a bear.

The bear can wait
and so can I, J.B.

What kind of new business
are you in?

Bandit, this is kind
of in the category of

what you don't know
won't hurt you.

Sounds like
it's in the category

of what I don't know
won't hurt you, huh?

There's some of that.

We got all day, partner.

We are not going anywhere until I
know exactly what it is you do.

Bandit!

Take your time, son.


All right, all right. I'll
show you the damn business.

But it's in the bear cabin.

What're we waiting for?
Let's do it.

Come on!

What you
looking for?

J.B. says the North Bear River boys
will do anything to get that bear back.

Anything?

Anything.
MEL: Why?

Well, they're pissed.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

Why?

I'll tell you what he told me,
take it for what it's worth.

He says whoever's the keeper of the
bear's gonna have a year of good crops,

good fortune,
and good loving.

Not necessarily
in that order.

Some fine loving, huh?

That's what
he says.

You believe him?

Of course not.

Me, either.

Oh, for God's sake.
Don't tell me you two

are taking this backwoods
fairytale seriously?

MEL: Absolutely not.

Hey, Lynn, how long's
it been since

folks have had some good...

The bear?

Fifty years.

MEL: Fifty years!

You are taking
this seriously!

MAN: I've got them covered.

Where's Bandit?

He and Johnny Bruce
ran into a little trouble.

North Bear River boys?

I don't think so.

They should
be here shortly.

Don't know how long
we can wait on the bear.

(BEAR GROWLING)


What was that?

The bear.
He's chained up inside.

We'll wait
for you here.

need us, just call for help.

You want to take your chances out
here alone? That's okay with me.

But you're sitting ducks.
Canned bear food.

(BEAR ROARING)

TEACH: What do you suppose
is gonna happen now?

MEL: What was that?

Quit backing up!

LYNN: Ow! You stepped
on my foot!

(LOUD ROARING)

(MEN CLAMORING)

(ROARING CONTINUES)

(ALL SCREAMING)

(ALL LAUGHING)

Oh, boy!
Honest to God!

Look at that!
Are you all okay?

Yeah, I tell ya, man, I told
Bandit there was no bear.

I knew it was all a joke on me,
I still fell for it anyway.

What do you mean there's no bear?
You see him, don't you?

I sure as hell do.

Oh, God. You mean to tell me
you go to all this trouble

just to play a little
joke on someone?

Hey, what's life
without a little fun?

Fun?

That's what I've been
telling you for 10 years.

Have fun,
enjoy yourself.

Are we gonna load the bear up or we
gonna let him walk there himself?

Let's load
him up.

Oh, boy, I wouldn't trade
this day for $100.

What do you mean
$100?

New tire, new rim, $100.

I was beginning to wonder if
you were going to show up.

Yeah? You get rid of
your new friends?

I see you found
the bear, huh?

Peaceful countryside?
A little bit of paradise?

Well, I promised you beautiful women.
Did I mention that?

of three ain't bad.

Look, I know it's ridiculous. But these
boys take their traditions seriously

and they have
guns, so...

Mel and I are gonna
guard the back door.

He's had a little
personality change.

I can see that.

Let's hit
the road, boys.

Aren't we forgetting
something there, J.B.?

What?

Isn't there a little business
you're supposed to be showing me?

Man, we're running kind of
late as it is now, Bandit.

If you want to run at all, I
want to know what you're up to.

Okay, come on.

Tapes?

Welcome to J.B. Label.

I sell them at a
drastically reduced rate.

A nearly perfect copy of any
album your heart desires.


Well, I would have got
the artists themselves,

but they've already
went and got record deals.

But this is
the next best thing.

You can't do it.

What?

You can't do this.

But, (STUTTERING)
I don't...

Well, obviously I can. Whether I
should or not is another question.

You know, you are hands down the best
at doing whatever it is you want to do

and making it look like
somebody else's idea

of anybody
I've ever seen, J.B.

Thank you.

I mean, if you put half
the time and energy you do

into outwitting the law into putting
together something legitimate,

you'd be
a millionaire by now.

What's the matter
with you, son?

You know,
you disappoint me.

You used to have
such potential.

J.B. Label's history?

Oh, oh, please,
please, please.

All right. All right,
all right. All right.

Which road
are we gonna take?

Only one road in
and one road out, buddy.

I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

I'll ride shotgun
with Lynn.

Let's do it.
All right.

Now, steady.
Now steady.

Now, hold on, boys.
Please.

Be careful,
steady, steady.

(TEACH CHATTERING

BANDIT: Poor boy,
you got your ears on?

What you got, Bandit?

It's looking like those
out-of-towners are following us.

(OVER <i>SPEAKER) But we got
no reason to worry, right?</i>

No, no reason at all.

Except for the carton of
tapes I threw in your trunk.

It's your car.
Think you'll go to jail?

Johnny B., I'm never gonna come
back and help you out again.

I mean it now. Never.

(OVER <i>SPEAKER) Lynn, I'm sorry,
buddy, you're on your own now.</i>

Ah, he loves me.
I'm his favorite cousin.

in pursuit of the Bandit.

WILSON: I have no idea.

you're out here.

<i>DISPATCHER</i> OVER <i>RADIO: <i>

I don't see any lake,
I see a bunch of trees.

<i>Any sign of your suspect?</i>

You mind if I play through?

(ENGINE REVVING)

<i>If you turned off the

there is no (SCREAMING) lake!

You okay there, son?

You wouldn't happen to
have a paddle, would you?

<i>DISPATCHER</i> OVER <i>RADIO: <i>
Agent Wilson, what's your 20?</i>

BANDIT <i>OVER</i> RADIO: <i>Poor boy, you

LYNN: Yeah.

<i>All right, good,
I'll see you in town.</i>

All right, buddy,
I'll see you there.

Great! Oh, I feel so
alive, you know, Melvin!

I don't know if it's
because of the fresh air

or the fact that I'm looking danger
right in the eye and not flinching.


Looks like an ambush ahead.

Watch this!

Whoa! Good idea,
good idea, but...

(LYNN HOOTING)

(LYNN LAUGHING)

Whoa! Not bad, son.

I meant to say
take a left.

Yeah, right, left, whichever
it is we're making great time.

Yeah, well,
there's this bridge.

I can handle a bridge.

Well, this is kind of a
weak, narrow little bridge,

and you know,
to tell you the truth,

I don't think
a truck's ever gone over it.

Yeah, where is it?

Right there.

Oh, no, oh, no,
hold on!

(BOTH YELLING)


Yes!

Oh, come on, baby!


J.B.: You made it,
you made it!

(sum-nus)

Whoa! Man, where did you
learn to drive like that?

Well, to tell you the truth,
I didn't think we'd make it.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(INSECTS BUZZING)

I don't give a damn
what you have to do.

Just get me some back up
and get it here now!

I want these guys
behind bars!

<i>J.B.: Great smile, spitfire.</i>

<i>I'd like to see it
around here for a while.</i>

(JENNIFER GASPING)

Yeah, she promised she
wouldn't tell anybody.

I'm not going to let
anybody stop us.

Ow! Ow! Beth!

What are you doing? What
is the matter with you?

Protecting myself from
Neanderthal throwbacks like you.

Watch it.

Beth, I have something
to say to you.

And you're going to listen
to me now, damn it.

Get off my property.

What are you going to do, stab me?
Go on, stab me.

But aim for my heart,

because Beth if you don't want to talk to
me anymore, I don't want to go on living.

I'm warning you.

Do it, I don't care.
Do it, seriously.

I wouldn't have to
deal with J.B.,

I wouldn't have to get the
damn bear to the parade.

I wouldn't have to
tell you that I love you.

Say that again?


I, uh, wouldn't have
to deal with J.B.

No, cut to the last line.

I love you, Beth.

See that's not fair.

You knew that
that would get me.

J.B.: The bear is ours.
After 50 years.

We finally made it!

What's that?

Ambush.

Well, we're gonna have to move it.
Can't run through that.

All right,
we'll cover you.

Can I shoot now?

Not yet.

Melvin, if, now, I say just if
they should start shooting.

Yeah? What if?

Where do you think the best
place for us to wait it out is?

Miami... Miami,
Panama Beach.

He spotted the rope.

Not until I tell you.

J.B.: I've seen trees fall.

Never saw one
tie itself.

He's going to see
the whole set up!

Not yet!

Here's where
they drug it across.

Now!

Wow.

I'd almost forgotten how
good it is to be home.

I'd noticed.

I can't believe
it's been five years.

Beth, there's...

There's something
I have to ask you.

<i>You got no place to run.
No place to hide, Bandit.</i>

Who is that, Jake?

You better be looking

Oh, by the way, Bandit,

you can find
your courageous crew

<i>down at Turtle Creek.</i>

The bear, watch yourself.

Oh, boy.

Beth, you understand, I've gotta get
that bear. I'll be back. Really.

(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

(CAR DRIVING AWAY)

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

Now what?

(MAN WHOOPING)


(CLAMORING CONTINUES)


What in Sam Hill has gotten
into you people here, huh?

They're saying Jennifer ran
off with Jason Russell.

Ain't no North Bear River boy gonna kidnap
one of our girls and get away with it.

I don't believe there's been
any kind of kidnapping.

No South Bear River girl's
gonna go on her own.

Well, maybe
she should have, huh?

You North Bear River people and
you South Bear River people

have been keeping each other
unhappy for over 100 years now.

How can you say that?

I mean, we start letting folks from
both sides of the river get married,

who knows where
it's gonna lead?

Give me two hours, okay?

Two hours?

Two hours?

Yeah, that'll give me time, I can
put this thing back together.

In the meantime, please, please,
nobody do anything stupid, please.

Bandit's right.
Let's go.

Two hours?

I mean, it'll be dark
by the time we get there.

I mean, we're not even going to
have time to check our levels.

You're right.
Lynn...

You tell your daddy we're
getting the bear back.

You wanna do me
a favor, buddy?

Get your hands on
some kind of vehicle

and see if you can get these boys
to the airport on time, please.

You don't
need me here?

Well, it's just I told them it
was going to be, a quick stop,

but it's not really working out
that way, and it's not fair.

Good luck to you.

Good luck. Is that it?
Good luck and good bye?

Well, isn't that the way
that you want it?

I... I guess.

Yes, it is.
All right.

There was
an ambush.

Excuse us. J.B., we got to
divide and conquer, okay?

You find the bear, I'm
going to find the kids.

And you get the bear, and you get
it over to the old saw mill.

The old saw mill?
Why the old saw mill?

Why? Why?
I'll tell you why.

Because you tricked me here in the
first place, you got me shot at,

I've been chased halfway
around this county

and I'm having a very, very bad day, J.B.
That's why, okay?

Oh.

You know,
it don't seem right.

to not stick around and help out.

Sure, I mean, what's an old
sound check, anyway?

Melvin, what are you, an
amateur or a professional?

What's the big deal? I mean, if she
wants to run off then just let her.

We don't let our family
run away so quickly.

I mean, we care about
what happens to them.

If you'd stick around
for a while,

you'll find out
what I'm talking about.

Come on.

Keep your eyes on the bear. I have a little
surprise visit to pay an old friend.

And then we'll have that
triumphant parade through town.

You're not gonna do
anything foolish, are you?

Five years ago, she left
me standing at the altar,

because she thought
she loved him.

It's time for me to get my revenge.
I'm gonna get it now.

You made him mad.

Shut up.

Beth.

What makes you think I know something
about some teenage romance?

How'd you know what I
was going to ask you?

Everybody on this side of the
river's up in arms, too.

Where are they?
I don't know.

Sorry,
I don't believe you.


Well, now, if you did know, and
I understand that you don't,

but if you did...

Why wouldn't
you tell me, Beth?

(VOICE BREAKING) It's not you.
It's everybody.

It's... It's just time
for this ridiculous custom

between North Bear River and South
Bear River to come to an end.

I mean, how many kids' lives
are going to be ruined

because of some stupid custom
we can't even remember

that says they can't be in
love and they can't be happy

just because they're from two
different sides of the river?

You're right.

I'm what?

You're right, Beth.

What's the trick?

I wanted to ask you...

Where do I start? It...

Looks like I'm going to be coming into
some money now, a lot of money...

And, I'm starting
to think about...

Damn it, Beth, do you know what
I'm trying to get to here?

You need a good accountant?

I want to help those kids, I don't want
them to make the same mistake that we did.

You think
we made a mistake?

I did.

The biggest mistake
of my life.

Follow me.

PREACHER: If any man
can show just cause

why this marriage
should not take place,

let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

BANDIT: Hold on, hold on.

Sorry, folks.

This Wedding's about to be
temporarily postponed.

Ignore that man.

You promised.

Don't worry, honey, it's
for the best, believe me.

Now, come on, son. We've got
a wedding to attend. Yours.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Everybody out of the cars.
Get out of the cars.

Give it up, Bandit.
It's over.

I've seen a few shotgun weddings in
my time, but this is ridiculous.

It's just a little
misunderstanding.

It's the most fun
I've had in 45 years.

I'm glad.

Turn over the tapes.

I don't have any tapes.

You think I fell off the
turnip truck yesterday?

Is that what happened
to you?

Search the cars.
AGENT: I'm on it, sir.

I'd be willing to tell
you where the tapes were

if you would be willing to give
me just a little bit of time.

WILSON: Oh, I'll be willing
to give you a little time.

About 20 years.

The government doesn't make
deals with outlaws or bandits.

Suit yourself.

You know,
it's funny.

But the last time we
were stopped up here,

didn't your daddy
have a shotgun on us?

Yeah, and Uncle Deke was
driving the pickup truck.

Yes, yes.

Just open the trunk.

Search up front.

Search the front. Tear
it apart if you have to.

Oh, that's not
gonna be necessary.

WILSON: You having any luck?

AGENT: Nothing here, sir.

I want those tapes. Now!

On the south side of town, about
three miles up the fire access road

there's a little cabin. If there's
something to find, you'll find it there.

And by the time
you get your car back,

I would have been done
with what I have to do.

See you, boys.
Good luck.

It took old Uncle Deke about
an hour to get back to town.

Good luck, boys.

Hey, boys, here's the
keys to the other car.

I'll get it, sir.

So, what are we gonna
do if they figure out

we're not
who they think we are?

I don't know.
Hell, you're driving.

Pardon me.

And we're not
going to stop them.

The hell we're not!

how to run your town, okay?

I don't give a damn
how you run your town.

But if you don't
accept this marriage,

lam going to have to
saw the bear in half.

You can't destroy that bear!
He belongs to us!

In a pig's eye! That
bear's been ours 50 years!

Well, he was ours
for 50 years before that!

Great, so you can
each have half.

Or you can accept this wedding
and the bear goes untouched.

It's up to you.

(SAWING MACHINE SWITCHING ON)

Do it, son.

What, are you serious?

Do it.

No!

If there's a wedding
going on today,

What?

I know you don't have a fancy
dan wedding dress on, Beth,

I don't care.

I'll take you
just the way you are.

You're not going to be
taking her anywhere,

because she's already
promised to marry me.

J.B.: (LAUGHING)
Hey, congratulations.

What?
What?

What the hell are you talking about?
I didn't agree on anything.

Well, I know that,
but he doesn't know that.

So, you can
play along right?

Play along with you?

You know that I was going
to ask you to marry me.

you were going to say yes.

Right?
I don't know any such thing.

you think I came back?

I'm not walking away
this time, Bandit.

If you want her, you're going
to have to go through me.

This is absurd.

That's fine with me.

Hold it, hold it.
Hold it, Bandit.

Hey, man, I love a fight
just as good as anybody,

but this is just
plain committance...

Committance...

What, Mel?
Hara-kiri.

I know.

(MEN URGING ON)

Well, let's just...

Let's do it like
gentlemen, huh?


Come on!
Let go! Let go!

Beth, what are you doing?

What makes you think you can just
come back here after five years

and just drag me off
like some caveman?

Beth, I don't mean
to drag you,

but, I mean, under
the circumstances...

Uh...

(CROWD GROANING)


Can we talk?

(CROWD CHEERING)

Let's just... Let's just
talk about this, huh?

Talk? We talked
five years ago.

You talked me out of town and
away from the girl that I love.

And you know, I've been meaning to
congratulate you on a fine career,

I'm a big fan.


MAN: Watch it, Bandit.

WOMAN: He's coming around.

(CROWD URGING ON)

Does this mean
we're not talking?

Okay, Jake.

No more Mr. Nice Guy.

Okay, that's it.
Now you've made me mad.

Jake Olsen! Let him
loose this minute!



Beth, I figured out
what it is.

I haven't asked
you properly.

You didn't ask me
at all.

Well, see, there you go.

That fits into the category
right there, don't you think?

I don't think much
about this whole thing.

What do you
want me to do?

Do you want me to get down on my
knees in front of all these people?

That would be nice,
yes.

(sum-nus)

Beth, would you consent...


This isn't how I planned
for this day to go at all.

BETH: You may as well
just kill each other,

because I'm not going to marry
anyone I don't choose to marry.

You know, she's right.

Well, of course she's right. I mean,
we're both being incredibly insensitive.

But you'd better stand
by whatever she says.

Whoever she chooses. I'll agree to that.
That's fine.

Good.
Because I choose nobody.

(PEOPLE MUTTERING)

(MAN LAUGHING)

What?

Say that again?

I choose neither of you.

Now, wait just a minute, Beth,
you just put us through this,

and you don't choose
either of us?

Bingo.

BANDIT: I thought...

You thought that
five years ago

you left a poor little
country girl heartbroken

while you went off to explore
the big, wide world.

Well, yeah. Something like that.
Yeah.

Well, that was
five years ago.

You mean, you ain't been pining away
over at least one of us all these years?

How can I put this?

No.

Beth! It's not fair, how
could you do that to us?

Yeah!

Sorry, boys,
you should've called.

I would have straightened
it out a long time ago.

Well, we got
a wedding to attend.

WOMAN: She's right.
We got a wedding.

(CROWD CHATTERING)

women at all?

Not me.

You're a mess.

You look pretty good.

I do.

Then by the powers

You may now

So, if you want to stay a
free man, I'd get over there,

I'd round everything up,
and I'd close up shop.

It's handled.

All right.

All right, pack your
rucksack and let's go.

Afraid you're on your own.
I'm staying here.

Hey!

All right! All right!

(EASY GIGGLING)

I just love
a happy ending.

It's been
a pleasure.

All mine.

Let's go boys.

Come on.

TEACH: Bye.

Well, maybe in another
five years.

Thank you for helping me out
with this wedding.

Hey, I'm never in too much of a
hurry to help out someone in need.

Okay.

Get the truck, Lynn. Let's
get out of here, buddy.

Psst. Come here.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
before we start,</i>

<i>I just want to say it's my great
pleasure and honor to be here today</i>

<i>to participate in this
tremendous charity effort.</i>

<i>With your help, we've raised
over a million dollars!</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Excuse me. I've got a very
important phone call to make.

We're rich, son.

What're you talking about?

Half of what goes into his pocket is ours.
That was the deal.

<i>And this check, $250,000,
goes to Mel Tills,</i>

<i>who's contributing the entire
amount to our children's charity.</i>

MEL: <i>Thank you. Mr. Rayford,
you're mighty kind.</i>

<i>And all you folks
are so kind to come out.</i>

<i>And you know what?</i>

<i>The entire amount of
this check, as you know,</i>

<i>is going to charity.</i>

<i>And it's not just
a gift from me,</i>

<i>why, I wouldn't even have
been here if it hadn't,</i>

<i>if it hadn't been for the
efforts of a young man,</i>

<i>a young man
called the Bandit.</i>

<i>(STUTTERING) Unfortunately the Bandit
couldn't, he couldn't be here today,</i>

<i>but I'm gonna start off the show.
Let's get on with the show.</i>

<i>And here's an old song that
I had out a few years ago.</i>

<i>It's called
the Coca Cola Cowboy.</i>
