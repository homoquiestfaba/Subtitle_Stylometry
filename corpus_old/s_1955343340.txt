      Man: Here.
      Rattle it, Roxanne.

          - Here, boss.
          - Here, boss.

            Here, boss.

           Here, boss.

            [clatter]

           Call them mixed breed
           commercial,

             which means
             just plain old cow,

          but she's the oldest,

           one of the first ones
           we bought.

         She's a great-grandma.

    What's her name?

            Well, you don't
            name them, Roxanne,

            because see,
            after a while...

            they're all gone.

         Did I show you the barn
         last time?

     I need to see Miss Landis.

Hold on. Just a second.
Dawn--

          Miss Landis?

Hold on a minute.

          Miss Landis.

Dawn, just calm down,
please.

    Miss Landis!

Just hang-- Just calm down
for a moment.

            Oh, God.

               All right, Elena,
               get some ice

                and, um,
                call the doctor.

              Okay.

Did Wayne do this?

 He come in through the window.

    Did you call the police?

    Dawn.

Aw, sweetie. Come on.
Isn't this what you want?

         But I love him.

            [chatter]

   Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

                    [ring]

        Hello.

            It's the police.

           Your daughter's been
           raped and murdered...

                    again.

       The curfew is 4:00.

   You're an hour late, again.

        Yeah. Makes you wonder.

 - Okay, Dulcie, you do your--
 - Homework.

   - There's cookies in the--
   -<i> Cupboard.</i>

    - And I'm going to be--
    - Late.

[phone rings]

      -<i> I'm sorry, honey.</i>
      - Piercings,

         <i> tattoos, and body art.</i>
         <i> What can I do for you?</i>

     You should've seen it
     when we moved in.

   There was junk everywhere,

    rats as big as fooalls,

      and the whole
      building was tilted.

    It still is.

           It is? Aah!

           [both gasp]

             Ta-da!

                    [laughing]

That's not funny.

  You want to change your mind
  about moving in?

       Because this is
       what I do all day.

Can I try it?

                        Sure.

             No. No.

          Sweetie, why don't you
          go finish unpacking?

Yeah, right.

       Uhh! You scared me.

           Well,
           you should be scared.

            It's a big step.

         I like it here.

           I like you.

     I liked you the first
     time I saw you

     at the museum
     staring at the nudes.

               Studying
               the brushstrokes.

Oh, right, yeah.

Well, I'm not worried
about anything.

     It's going to be good
     for us here.

           I know it.

              Welcome to Idaho.

              Welcome to Idaho.

[door closes]

Woman: Dulcie?

          Oh, come on.

            Dulcie, what--

            Oh my God.

   Somebody pinch me because
   this is a frickin' nightmare.

All right, that's it.
Get off.

      No, wait. You're here.
      Why don't you get one too?

    - Dulcie, get down.
    - What do you have for--

    - Get off the table.
    - ...a middle-aged woman

            who hasn't had a man
            in ten years?

    Dulcie.

    Man: How about a turtle?

Woman, laughing:
Cut him off.

    - [phone rings]
    - That's our family pet.

        - Oh, he's so--
        - That's it.

        - Well, you did.
        - [ring]

                    Hello.

      Stephen, it's Angela.

...embarrassed.

    I can't believe
    you brought this.

        Well, how are you?

            <i> Oh, she's really</i>
            <i> done it this time.</i>

       I'm fine.
       Thanks for asking.

  Stephen, this is not
  just my problem, all right?

      This is our problem.

<i>All right, Angela,</i>
<i>what did she do?</i>

        Oh, you'll see
        when we get out there.

              Get--

      <i> Well, school's over</i>
      <i> in a week,</i>

   <i> and I thought that, uh....</i>

   I thought maybe we'd, um--

   maybe I would drive her out

     and leave her with you
     for the summer.

        You're coming?

<i>Well, I thought,</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>

<i>if I drove her</i>
<i>that we could talk</i>

<i>and we could--</i>

    you know, the thing is--

           [sigh]
           I hit her.

     What? I can't hear you.

              Do--

      Do you not want her
      to come, Stephen?

Well, of course I do.

I love her, Angela.

            Good. Done. Okay.

            So, um...

        we'll be out, then,
        on the, uh, on the 23rd,

         sometime after dinner.

So between,
say, 7 and 7:03.

        Though I can only stay
        the weekend. I have to--

Yeah, but-- It's just...

I have someone.

                    What?

<i>Someone's moving in</i>

with me-- a woman.

            Well, we've, uh,

        been divorced
        for ten years, Stephen,

                    so it--

       No. I just thought
       you should know.

   - Thanks.
   - So there wouldn't be any

               Yeah. Thank you.

  And she has a daughter, too,

      a couple months
      younger than Dulcie.

            Oh, well, as luck
            would have it, huh?

     As luck would have it.

            Anyway--

        I don't know
        how Dulcie feels

  about a summer on the farm,
  but I think it's great.

            <i> Well, she hates it,</i>
            <i> Stephen.</i>

          <i> She hates everything.</i>

           Be warned.

            Right side or left?

           Don't let this Angela
           thing bother you.

            Of all the times
            for her to call--

Did you tell her about us?

        Sure, but it's none
        of her business anyway.

            We're divorced.

      I know. You told me.

                      Yeah. So?

   But you didn't tell me why.

    How about when it's not
    our first night

         and I put on my
        best sweatpants?

 Well, we used to look at these
 real estate catalogs, ya know?

            Uh, country places.

          Uh, no special reason,
          but I don't know.

            This place seemed--

       See, it was just supposed
       to be for a few years.

            That was the deal,

            and then we'd go
            back to the city

            and she'd get
            her law degree.

            I don't know.

            Something
            happened to me.

                    I just--

            I couldn't leave.

        I felt I owed the cows.

                    [chuckle]

            That's silly.

   Uh, then it all just kinda--

            You had to ask.

    No. No, it's--

    it's-- it's fine.
    I wanted to know.

              Wow.

  I'll bet that that's the only
 nightgown in the entire county

        that isn't flannel.

        [laughing]

    The left side.

        Well, it's a very long
        day to the farm.

            What do you want
            to talk about?

How about the way
you're ruining my life

by making me spend the summer
in Cow Dung, Idaho?

You know what
the license plates say?

"Famous Potatoes."

Famous freaking
potatoes, mom.

         You'll survive.

I'll miss everything.
I'll come back,

and no one
will remember me.

        We can only hope.

    There was an Arby's
    right by the exit.

        But just make sure
        you file the papers

       with Judge Nusbaum, okay?
       Nobody else.

        Now, the Don McAllister
        thing--

        I don't know, just do
        whatever follow-up--

  What did you do to your hair?

    It was dirty.

           You wash dirty hair.

You wouldn't let me take
a shower this morning.

This is what you get.

        You wouldn't wake up.
        I called you ten times.

    It's my hair!

      Angela: Almost there.

    Look. They still
    have that sign.

         Oh, yeah. The Coffees.

We'd have totally different
lives if we'd stayed here.

We'd be totally
different people.

              Hmm?

     You know, it makes me
     nervous coming back.

You know what I wish?

      - Sometimes I wish--
      - Here we are.

                    Daddy!

              Ahh!

           Oh, so big.

             So big.

Oh, Leah, Roxanne.

         - Angela, hi.
         - Hi.

Uh, I'm afraid the couch
is all we have left.

            Oh, that's fine.

      Oh, and, Dulcie,
      your room is just--

   You-- You know that. Sorry.

Um, so anyway, uh,
we'll talk tomorrow.

        - Yeah.
        - Oh, I'm, uh--

      I'm, uh, fixing up
      a barbecue tomorrow

   while the menfolks are out,
  you know, cutting the wheat.

      Angela, Stephen: Hay.

           - The hay.
            - Well...

       That's right.
       Hay for the cows.

        Okay, good night.

         Are you sure this whole
         thing's gonna be--

Yeah. No, it's fine.
It's fine.

                    Okay.

                    Well...

    welcome home.

       This one's perfect.

I hope it's enough.

          - Hi.
          - Henrietta.

           Hey, Angela. Oh, it's
           been a long time.

    Oh my God.
    It's good to see you.

       - You look good.
       - Yeah, so do you.

        - A little thin.
        - Oh.

         - Asa.
         - Look at her.

        Nice to see you.

   Oh this isn't Will, is it?

                That's the boy.

        - Hi, Will.
        - Will the weed.

    Mom, can I have the keys?

        - A church group.
       - Drive carefully.

Well, it's all ready,
everybody.

         - Come dig in.
         - All right.

      - Uh, Angela helped.
      - Well--

   Where's little Miss Dulcie?

   - I haven't seen her in--
   - Dulcie.

Does this bring back
memories?

          Oh, does it.

We had the two families,
the Roberts--

    And the Wilwards.
    See, we'd barbecue out,

     the whole bunch of us,
     after a day's work.

           Oh, when all the kids
           were to home.

Now it's only Will left,

but he's decided
on farming.

He says--
Did you know that?

    - Oh, you must be happy.
    - Praise the Lord.

               Praise Him,
               but only He knows

         who'll be left
         on this road

                by the time
                Will takes over.

              All the young ones
              are gone anymore.

            Did you see when you
            were comin' on in?

            Folks are moving up
            from the city,

            buying a couple
            of acres.

       No intention of farming.

            And those acreage
            people,

              you can't neighbor
              with them.

        Nope.

    Dear Lord, we thank you
    for this bounty

  and especially for bringing
  old friends back to us

     on this beautiful day.

             - Amen.
             - Amen.

         - Amen.
         - [door opens]

        What about ants?

No ants in Idaho, Dolly.
You know that.

            Come on, say hello.

            You remember
            Mr. and Mrs. Coffee.

       Dulcie, let me
       get you something.

               Asa:
               Boy, she's grown.

    Ah. Wienies.

     So what am I gonna do
     here all summer?

Well, Will's church social
group has kids your age.

      There's a water slide
      over in Meridian that is--

    Chores.

              Pass.

 I won't do anything with cows.

        Um, why not?

Their heads are way too big.

    I mean, come on.

      [Imitating Marlee Matlin]
      Are you capable of speech?

            Stop it.

        You forget how beautiful
        it is here.

       Then why don't you
        spend the summer?

It's your home, Dulcie.

        This is not my home.

It's the first house
you ever lived in.

    - The only house until--
    - Until she left you?

                    Stop.

How--
How is everybody doing?

Can I get you anything?

    No, it's all wonderful,
    really.

            And why do you still
            have that...thing?

           I mean, it's not like
           anybody's ever going
           to use it again.

Not supposed to use it.
It's a sculpture.

    You got it for me
    out of a Sears catalog.

           I remember.

      You used to push me.

Yeah, when you were
little and human.

        What?

   This is the same tea I bought
   15 years ago, isn't it?

            I guess.

   You've never used any of it?

            You never bought
            any new ones?

        I guess not.

        It's pathetic, Stephen.

I take it you can't sleep.

    I'm leaving in the morning.

       You don't have to.

     Well, I think that Leah may
     disagree with that, but--

But you haven't even
walked around the place.

Don't you want to see
all the changes?

           What, now?

        Okay.

            I have a plan
            to improve the herd.

          I'm gonna bring in
          a big Siminthol bull
          that the Leesons have.

    Yeah.

           Maybe I'll breed them
           all up to purebred,

            take them around
            to state fairs,

            and make a fortune.

Are you, um--
I mean, you know, is it--

do you think it's going
to be hard financially--

   - What? No.
   - ...to have Dulcie here?

Because I can send money.

               I don't need it.

Well, I know, but you
can always use it.

        I don't need your money,
        Angela.

    I got it.

                    Good.

Gee, feels just like
old times, doesn't it?

           There were some good
           old times here, too.

    You're a million miles away,
    so it's easy to forget,

            but I'm still here.

      I see places and things
      every day, and I remember.

           We had
           some good years here.

    I know that.

What do you think, Steve,
that I would--

What, you think
I'd forget that?

I remember all the years,

every one, and...
they were the best.

    They were.

The best years were here.

              Yeah.

                    Wait.

             Dulcie.

She's screwed up.
She hates you.

She's flunking out of school.
What did I miss?

           It's just that I'm--

           I'm, uh,
           I'm giving her to you

            and running away,

            and it's not fair

          because she's gonna
          ruin your relationship

            with--
            oh, what's her name,

        but I'm doing it anyway

            because I don't want
            to see her anymore.

            I don't want to see
            my own daughter.

          How do you like that?

            So I'm, uh...

    I'm glad she came.

I mean, maybe just being
here will help.

               Do you think so?

        Maybe.

             Don't count on it.

    Oh, bye, Leah.
    Thanks so much.

    Nice to meet you.
    Roxanne.

     - Have a nice summer.
     - You, too.

             - Okay.
             - Okay.

        All right.

           Goodbye, sweetheart.

        Please try to be
        good, huh?

           I hate you.

[engine starts]

            [sobbing]

    [snort]

        You want something?

       I'll give you something.

           You hungry?

           Is that it?

            Huh? Is that it?
            Are you hungry?

                        Easy.

                        Here.

           That's it.

              That's it. Drink.

               Drink, you ugly,
               jug-headed freak.

    Where are you taking her?

                To the butcher.

               I don't like
               the looks of her.

          It could be hardware,

            but she hasn't bred
            in a while.

            You can't keep
            an open cow.

               It costs too much
               in feed.

            I hate to lose them,
            especially her,

   but I get 600 bucks from
   the butcher if she's alive

      and zero from
      the rendering works

   if she just happens
   to keel over one day, so--

What's the rendering works?

    It's where they
    turn them into soap.

         It's a business, baby.

Hey, you want to come with me?

    We could all go.

    Have lunch after.

              [moo]

               Roxanne: Boring.

   Why doesn't he have cable?

       No cable, no mall,

    or a-- or a McDonalds

    - or a Burger King or--
    - Taco Bell?

           - Wendy's.
           - Dominos.

Girls, would you please
stop complaining?

All you've done
since we got here

is sit on your rear ends
and complain every wak--

            Are you mocking me?

You do not mock your mother.

Now, listen, I-- Oh.

    What--

         Look, hold on.

                    Stay here.

         The rope broke.

      Uh, stay back.
      It's dangerous here.

                I got to get her
                tied off.

              Damn.

             Dulcie!

             Dulcie!

             [gasp]

         Will, the cow!

              Okay.

             Dulcie!

             Dulcie!

                        Dulcie!

             Dulcie!

     Dulcie, will you stop?

                        Dulcie.

                        [grunt]

              Aah!

        Are you crazy?

          Bugga-bugga.

Got her in real good.
She won't get loose.

    All right.

Apologize to Leah.

I don't care if you are crazy.

You will apologize
for what you did.

    Will, I have to ask you
    one more favor.

       Would you take her home?

    Yeah.

         I still gotta
         get the cow.

              Okay.

You know,
I'll go with you.

        You don't have to.

      Mom, I'm just gonna
      go home, okay?

       Hey, but we won't get
       to see them kill the cow.

         <i> â™ª [loud rock]</i>

[music stops]

                Where's Dulcie?

          In her room.

Mrs. O'Dell, Stephen,
uh, if it's okay with you,

I'm gonna take the girls
to the movies tonight.

           Huh. Uh...

   Well, what time would you
   have them back?

        Any time you say.

      Uh, Stephen, do you--

               I have to go talk
               to Dulcie.

          [phone rings]

              Damn.

           - Hello.
           -<i> Stephen.</i>

Angela. Oh, man.

    What? What's the matter?

You better talk to Dulcie.

        - <i> Why?</i>
        - Dulcie, phone.

             Hello.

Dulcie, what's the matter?

            I hate it here.

Nothing new, you mean.

           I want to come home.

Honey, only two more
months and--

   <i> There's a flight tonight.</i>
   <i> I can--</i>

              I can be home by 7
              if I leave now.

      I'll hitch to the airport,
      all right?

<i>Dulcie, honey,</i>
<i>wait a minute. It--</i>

It's just new, that's all.
You don't--

           No, let me come home,
           Mommy. You--

      Sweetheart, listen--

            You won't even know
            I'm there.

            I won't make
            any trouble.

    No, listen.
    Your dad loves you.

            I'll be better.
            I'll be better.

  I know he loves you, and so--

    I promise I will be better.

If you're feeling sad,
you talk to your father, okay?

 I'll be better, Mommy, please.

      Please, just let me
      come home, Mommy!

<i>Please, please.</i>

        I'm sorry, baby.

     Y-You can't come home.

[dial tone]

                     Drop dead.

   Will said he's coming over?

            Is that a question?

            Are you asking me?

And, uh, if you want,

    I--

I could cut your hair.

I'm-- I'm pretty good.

                        Okay.

              Hey.

    I don't look like
    an insane bag lady anymore.

      How'd you do that?

            Oh, God.

      All right, that took
      a whole half hour

       out of my hideous
       wasted life.

            Now what?

    The movies change tomorrow.

       I don't want
       to watch anything.

     I want to do something.

   I want to drive something.

     I want to steal something.

Uh, I have a church group.

You guys could come with me.

         [Dulcie laughs]

It's not that bad.
There's usually good food.

        Could be fun.

They come in
from the fields, you know,

and they just kind
of run around.

            Mm-hmm.
            And spread disease.

    Nothing fatal.

               I am not afraid.

And I'm sorry.

I mean, the kids are gone,
the wine is chilled,

the Monopoly game's set up.

It's gonna
be a night.

              [laughing]
              It doesn't matter.

         I told you
         I like it here.

    Still?

Even with the Daughter
from the Black Lagoon?

           Yes. With everything.
           I'm happy.

            Stephen,
            I'm happy with you.

Good. That's good.

             - Okay.
             - Okay.

        You ready?

                    Um, okay.

                    Aw.

    Hey, big boy.

     And it's got a vacuum meter
     for spacing out the seeds.

          Now, you can drive up
          to 15 miles and hour,

    and it would still space out
    the seeds perfectly.

            The way we used
            to have to do it

         was get down off
         the tractor, dig down--

[exaggerated snoring]

            ...see how deep
            the kernel was.

       Now science has made life
       easier for me and him.

              Now it's time for
              some refreshments.

           [applause]

Thanks.
That was a real treat.

            I thought
            it was interesting,

            sort of.

Is there any chance
they play some music?

Rox and I could dance.

       Our church doesn't really
       encourage dancing.

                    Why?

        They say it's a prelude
        to intercourse.

    [laughing]

        I'm not saying I agree.

    What a rebel.

              Is he saying stuff
              about me?

Get me out of here,
or I'm going to freak out.

         I got a truck.

        Who don't?

                    This way.

   So they drained this thing
   a few years ago,

 and they found the whole
 bottom was covered with cars.

             Really?

            Yeah.

     Nobody even knew
     they were down there.

Were there any bodies?

         Hey. Hey, wait.

  It's not much of a swimming
  hole, you know.

     I got gear
     in the truck, though,

    if you want to go fishing.

    Is he kidding?

It's a phoenix, Beefheart.

     It rises from the dead,

        just like me.

           Hey, hey,
           don't go too far out.

           It's deep.

    Then come and save me.

            I-- I can't.

    I've got my dress pants on.

           Candy boy!

           Candy boy!

           Candy boy!

           Candy boy.

    Candy boy!

            Candy boy! Aah!

        [Dulcie squeals]s]

     Hey!

        Come on. Come on.

              Guys.

         I touched one.

No, you did not.
It's 60 feet down.

           I did, too.

    I touched one, candy boy.

         A 1975 Mustang.

      - Convertible.
      - Four on the floor!

        You know what?

    This is a good place.

    This is the first good
    place I've been to

    in all of frickin' Idaho!

         [boys whooping]

        Okay. Clutch out.

         Slowly, slowly.

      Clutch in, clutch in.

     Don't worry, it's okay.

         You ready? Ah!

           I've always
           been ready.

              Okay.

       Clutch out. Slowly.

        There you go.
        Okay, gas, gas.

              Gas!

            There you go.

           That's it.

        [laughing]

        Shift.

          [engine revs]

              Aah!

               Oh.

    Okay. Second gear.

    It's pretty good
    for the first lesson.

          Dork attack.

           [honk honk]

   Uh, Dulcie, what are you--

    Oh, yeah. Okay, come on.

Stop before we get
to that truck.

You heard that,
didn't you, Dulcie?

           - What?
           - Dulcie.

            [honking]

            - Brake.
            - Ho--

        Aah!

              Whoa!

     Hilarious. Very funny.

    Whoa, does he need
    a new tractor or what?

                    [honk honk]

              Ahh.

       Leah:
       Hey, is that you?

    What have you been doing?

    Oh, I'm making
    that pasta you like.

    It's the penne arrabiata,

    You know, the one
    with the spice--

                    [grunt]

What is the matter?

    Oh, nothing.
    It's just farmer's back.

    I slipped going after
    that brindle calf.

    The pinheaded one.

    What did you say?
    "Pan Arabian?"

   Great, just give it to me
   here on the floor.

        Ohh. You work too hard.

        - You know what?
        - Hmm.

            I want you to relax
            tonight.

            I'll take care
            of everything.

            I will...feed you.

            I will
            tuck you into bed.

          Oh, will you?

           Oh, I will.

                    I will.

              - Mm.
             - Uh--

            Hi.

            - Uh--
            - Sorry.

              - Hi.
             - Bye.

                       Uh, bye.

     Dulcie, the boys are here.

    She's not here.
    She went out with Tony
    a couple of hours ago.

          We are alone.

        Uh, you mean they're not
        all going out together?

   I don't know. You think
   Dulcie tells me anything?

  Does Roxy tell you anything?

            She always did
            before we came here.

            Hmm.

         Uh, Stephen...

            I know
            Dulcie has problems,

       and I feel sorry for her,
       you know that, but--

       This is about Will?

  But I don't want her problems

   to become Roxy's problems.

       She's going though
       a rough time.

        Give her a break.

            That's what you do.

            You want to know
            what else you do?

       Do I have a choice?

        You laugh at her jokes.

    That's it. That's the extent
    of your parenting.

Well, I think she's funny.

        She's naming the cows.

       Well, that's good.
       Isn't that good?

        And so far, she's gotten
        "Knocked up,"

        "Humper," and "Fart."

            Roxanne listens.

Yeah. And pretty soon
she'll be smoking crack

just to be like Dulcie.

        I hate that, Stephen.

    But it's okay
    to slam my daughter?

      Dulcie needs a firm hand.

    Come on. Don't give me
    curfews and grounding.

    Angela did that.

            Yeah? Well,
            I'm not Angela.

What's the matter, man?

You're supposed to help
with the wood, too, you know.

This is going to be
a pitiful fire.

                        Rox?

I have to tell you something.

Something secret.

    I think I'm--
    I-- I think I'm--

                    Pregnant.

        What did you say?

We-- We bought a...

pregnancy test thing.
Can you help me?

         Yeah, sure.
         Just pee on it.

          That's all, and then,

               if it turns blue,
               then--

     Okay, what is going on?

                   Take a hike.

    No, w-we're not ashamed.

                    It speaks.

          You tell him.

   She thinks she's knocked up.

        - With child?
        - No, with calf.

          Come with me.

She's going to have a baby?

           I hope so.

You hope so?

              Blue.

      This is the best news

        I have ever heard
       in my entire life.

         Oh, I love you.

  I want you to have our child.

    I want you to be my wife.

        [sobbing]

        You're crazier than me.

         First of all...

  I-- I want to tell you that--

    that I've been born again.

                        Oh.

           Uh, well, you're
           half Jewish, Roxanne.

     It's all one faith in God.

           And, um...

          And second...

               I--

       I'm gonna
       have Will's baby.

We're going
to get married.

They're in love.

Ever heard of it?

                 Go home, Will.

        I want him to stay.

           Go... home.

            We don't even
            have a doctor.

             We don't even
             have a doctor here.

              Uh...

        not that I would let
        a doctor here touch her.

            Uh, okay, so we're
            going to have to go
            back to Seattle.

        We're gonna have to call
        Shepherd because...

            And you are not
            getting married.

    And you are not born again.

What do you think, she was,
like, brainwashed by a cult?

She actually wants to get
married and have a baby

and stay here in Cowville,

which I wouldn't do
if you took my liver out.

            Shut up!

    For once,
    this is not about you.

     This is my baby's life,

      and you have nothing
      to do with it.

             Don't.

       I want to be alone
        with my daughter.

                    Now.

        I should be there.
        I told Rox I'd be there.

            What do you think
            Leah's doing to her?

        She is reminding her,
        I would guess,

        that she was only 17
        when Roxanne was born.

             Really?

And that she didn't
finish high school

or go to college,

and maybe that's why
she wants a better life

for her daughter.
Help me with the nails.

          I hate nails.

        Anyway, what she wants
        isn't the point.

        Her parents didn't want
        her to get knocked up,
        but she did.

    You should just let a person
    do what they want to do.

       Not if they're 16,
       you shouldn't.

    Well, people
    used to get married when
    they were, like, 10.

Yeah, and they used to die
when they were, like, 18.

     Well, how old were you guys
     when you got married?

          A lot older.

              See? Your marriage
              was still a flop.

It wasn't a flop.

      We had some
      good years together.

We had you.

            Your bad luck.

    They were the best
    years of my life.

      Well, then you should just
      leave Will and Rox alone.

        Maybe
        they'll get a divorce,

        but they can have
        some good years, too,

            and they'll
            still have the baby.

            Is Leah sorry
            she had Rox?

       I'm sure she isn't.

               And are you sorry
               you had me?

        Every day.

       You're very smart,
       you know that?

Of course you're wrong,
but you're very smart.

          [phone rings]

             [ring]

             Hello.

          Are you sitting down?

    - Dulcie. What--
    - <i> No, believe it or not.</i>

    Roxanne is pregnant
    with Will Coffee's baby.

        <i> They're getting married</i>
        <i> on Labor Day.</i>

       Oh, you're kidding.

       - God's been busy.
       -<i> Who?</i>

           Hey, Dulcie
           is the maid of honor

           and the godmother.

<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>She's the godmother?</i>

      Well, out this way,
      it's not so funny.

           No, no, of course.
           I'm sorry. I wasn't--

       So, um, how's poor Leah?

            Not good.

    I can't believe she's
    allowing Roxanne to do this.

  Well, I think it came down
  to letting it happen

  or losing her daughter.

                    Yeah.

                    So, um...

        are you, um-- I mean,
        are you two okay?

               No.

            This isn't Dulcie's
            fault, is it?

        No. It has nothing
        to do with Dulcie.

             Well, that's good.

      -<i> Yeah, she's fine.</i>
      - I miss her.

    Well, she'll be flying back
    right after the wedding.

        I could come out.

              What?

    Or, you know,
    I don't know. I just--

        You want to come out
        for Roxanne's wedding?

             Well...

            I think
            that would be great.

             You do?

                    Yeah.

    Because then I could
    just drive her back,

    and there's no planes,
    no tickets.

                    Sure.

        You tell Dulcie.

      Don't worry about Dulcie.

            It sucks.

It's very generous offer.

    Dad, it's the 21st century.

       They have airplanes now.

Well, tickets ain't cheap.

I'm pretty low, Dulce.

I mean, the wedding and--

         - Me?
         - Absolutely.

    You've been nothing
    but trouble and money.

Bear with her, Dulce.
She loves you.

She wants you home.

I mean,
I'm gonna miss you, but--

             Right.

        Now...

I wish you could stay.

I like
having a daughter again.

You do want to go home,
don't you?

                    Well...

            But I'll miss
            the manure festival.

    You look--

        Yeah, so do you.

    I hope you don't mind me
     staying here this time.

   - Ah.
   - Last time was so tough,

       and I thought Leah was--

            She's not with you.

               No.

      Another perfect day
      on the farm.

I think she's stuck.

            Oh, yeah.

         She's stuck real good.

                        [moo]

             I can't leave her.

           I'm sorry.

            You know
            where the church is.

             Farmer.

                        [moo]

   â™ª [organ playing fanfare]

            [chatter]

           [cheering]

    â™ª [organ playing
    the wedding recessional]

                    Hey.

                 Mrs. Coffee.

         Angela: Dulcie.

        You look so beautiful.

                        Trouble?

      I can't get her out.

Easy, girl, easy.

    [moo]

Easy. Easy.

           Whoa. Whoa.

That's a girl.

    Whoa.

No, Angela, it's dangerous.

             Uh-huh.

You're going to ruin
your good clothes.

       - Okay.
       - Okay, easy girl.

Her name is Sylvia.

        You're naming them now?

No, the girls did.

Dulcie said once
they learn their names,

we can teach them tricks.

You ready?
Come on, push.

        - Ohh. Come on.
        - [moo]

Come on.
Come on, girl.

                    [grunt]

Well, push!

                   I am pushing.
                   [laughing]

Come on, Sylvia. Come on.

                 Come on, girl.

             [grunt]

          Stephen: Ohh!

             Are you all right?

    [laughing] Yes.

             [Stephen laughing]

            Oh. Ohh!

Oh, can you help me?

                    Here.

            - Ready?
             - Okay.

          And... Okay.

            Oh, gr--

          Just walk right off
          like nothing happened,

           you dumb--

             - Here.
             - Okay.

             - Uhh!
              - Oh.

                        Yeah.

         [flies buzzing]

                             Aw.

Oh, what's an old dress?

               Talk about dumb.

            I missed the wedding
            for a cow.

Well, I told everyone
what you were doing,

and Asa said,
"Oh, bless him."

                    Yeah.

                    How was it?

It was beautiful.
It was just--

Oh, I sh you could've
seen Dulcie.

        She was--

She took my breath away.

          You did good.

            [honking]

             - Hey.
              - Hi.

              Hey.

       Hey, what have you
       guys been doing?

    - Uh, fishing for cows.
    - Yes.

        Congratulations,
        Mrs. Coffee. Ah.

             Oh, Roxanne, it was
             just beautiful.

         It really was.

           Thank you.

           Bye, Dulce.

           Be good to her,
           or I'll castrate you.

    Ahem.

         I wish you could stay.

      Wouldn't it be great?

     We could go to school
     together next year.

It beats Central High.

           Just till
           the little guy comes.

         I need you here
         for that.

         You're my best friend.

             Daddy.

Yes, sweetie.

      Damn, I'm gonna miss you.

Ready to go, honey?

We gotta go, guys.

      - Roxanne: Goodbye.
      - Okay.

     - Will: See you later?
     - Yeah, have fun.

            Will, where's Leah?

        We don't know.

                    Some truck.

[Roxanne laughs]

    Yeah.
    You think red's okay?

                Red's the best.

I don't know.
It's not very Christian.

Thank you for everything,
Stephen.

           [honk honk]

    There you are.

We were worried about you.

    Did you see Roxanne?

    She was here.

     I'm sorry
     I missed the wedding.

 I just couldn't leave the cow.

            Where's Angela?

I just took her
back to the motel.

            Where's Dulcie?

She's out with Tony.

It's her last night, so--

            So we're alone.

Yeah.
You want some dinner?

                    Mm-mm.

            I want the carrot.

          I'm leaving.

      I want you to know that I
      don't blame you or Dulcie.

        I just wish that
        I had never met you.

    We went to the hospital
    for an ultrasound,

         and we saw him.

     Yeah, it's a him, too,

   and we saw his little thing.

   Oh, it's a blessing, Dulcie.

     Are you ready
     to press charges now?

         - Come on.
         - [whimpering]

Yes. Press charges, okay?
Are you ready now?

        - Yes, yes.
        - Press charges.

      Get him! He killed--

                   I'm a whale.
                   I'm a freak.

    No.

                But Will says--

               he says
               I look beautiful.

And she does.

         He says I glow.

         <i> [line ringing]</i>

            [ringing]

        We felt the little guy.

          I felt this--

        this punch or something,
        and I yelled,

            and Will came in,
            and I could see it.

            I wish you could've
            been here, Dulcie.

                It's a blessing.
                It is.

                    I miss you.

             [ring]

             [ring]

             Hello.

     Hey, Stephen, it's me.

       Angela. Hey. Great.

     Why aren't you working?

        It's Saturday.

           So? [chuckling]

     Stephen, please.

   You know what? I need help.

       What's the matter?

 <i> I saw one of Dulcie's essays,</i>

  and it-- I don't know.
  It just doesn't make sense.

    It's all about
    wanting us to disappear

        and a cow's head
         and antifreeze.

  <i> And it's not that she's</i>
  <i> doing anything bad anymore.</i>

        - Well, that's--
        - <i> Stephen,</i>

         she's not doing
        anything at all.

         She just sits.

        <i> She doesn't-- And I'm--</i>

  I'm just afraid that she's--

      might-- I don't know.

             What? Oh, come on.

      <i> I said I don't know.</i>

   <i> I'm asking for your help.</i>

                I don't, either.
                I'm not--

    Here. No. You're not.
    You're not here.

      But I did spend the entire
      summer with her,

         and she was just fine.

     - Don't--
     - [call waiting beeps]

            Hang on.

            [grumble]

    Dulcie.

                    Hmm.

It's Roxanne
on the phone.

She sounds upset.

               Mm?

       Dulcie, are you--
       are you awake?

    Are you listening to me?

            Mm-hmm. Rox?

    There's something wrong
    with the baby.

            Um, the--

      the heartbeat was--
      was-- was wrong,

    <i> and they did some tests,</i>

             <i> and...</i>

           <i> they said</i>

    that, um, it was genetic

           and, um...

    he's gonna die.

           Are-- Are they sure?

         <i> I don't know.</i>

I don't know. I--

I can feel him kicking,
just the same as always.

            <i> Well...</i>

        [car door closes]

Here comes Will.

I have to go.
I have to tell him.

<i>He doesn't know.</i>

        - Wait, Rox.
        - <i> I have to go.</i>

       [click, dial tone]

        What? What is it?

         Hey, stranger.

             Daddy!

               Ah.

            Oh, geez.

           There's hypothermia.

            Here. Put this on.

           Yeah. Okay?

          Now, listen--

Let me stay
till Sunday, please.

           You scared your mom,

 - you stole her credit card--
 - Saturday.

            ...you are flunking
            out of school.

Friday. Friday night.

I got a good deal
on the tickets.

I saved her
a hundred bucks.

            They took Roxy
            to the hospital

        a couple of hours ago.

The baby.
I'm in time for the baby?

Well, come on, hit it.

        Okay, but
        the baby's not gonna--

What? It's gonna be okay.

    Just don't expect too much.

           [murmuring]

Dulcie, sweetie.

        Where's the baby?

They're still working
on her, honey.

"It's time the baby comes"
is what they said.

So, uh, they're, um...
What do they call it?

    Inducing her.

        But it's gonna be fine.

     We've been praying
     ever since we heard, and...

     he's gonna be okay.

                Hello, Stephen.

    How are you?

         It's not real.

    Okay, the lecture.

                    Spare me.

         I'm a flunk-out
         rave queen.

    A what?

                    Nothing.

You scare me, baby.

You don't know what it's
like to have a child.

It changes you completely.

Before we had you,
I just-- I was like ice.

Nothing could touch me,

and then you were born,
and I melted that minute.

        Uh...

    I look at you,
    and I see danger.

I think "My God,
she flew up here alone.

She hitched at night, alone."

And I just want to shrivel up.

    You don't know.

You're not supposed to know.

You're 16 and you're gonna
live forever, and that's good.

    And I don't yell,
    you know that.

    I don't make rules.

    But, baby, look at me.

    You're not crazy, Dulce,
    are you?

            Not here.

          [door opens]

           It's a boy.

                    [gasps]

        - You knew that.
        - [laughter]

    His name is
    William Asa Coffee III.

   - Man: Praise the Lord.
   - He was born at 3:12 a.m.

    He's 5 pounds, 2 ounces.

       He's kind of small.

      - Asa: Hallelujah.
      - Group: Hallelujah.

           I love you.

     So is that the little guy?

       Doesn't look like there's
       anything wrong with it--

                    him.

           What's the tube for?

     It's how they feed him.

                        Oh.

I'm allowed to hold him.

Would you like
to see me hold him?

                    Sure.

    So, um, I was thinking first
    thing when he leaves here,

            we should take him
            down to the quarry,

            you know,
            where it all began.

Would you
like to hold him?

        Isn't it against the law
        or something?

Smell his breath.

                        What?

He's never had
anything to eat.

There's nothing to smell
but pure life.

                Maybe you better
                take him.

                    I, uh...

      I'll be right back, okay?

            [sobbing]

 You spent so little time
 on earth, yet were you loved.

       And though you be
       born into sin,

      you should be
      raised up from sin,

    that the grace
    of Jesus Christ almighty

   may shine upon thy soul...

     in the sure
     and certain knowledge

  that you shall be born again
  into God's world.

          Let us pray.

      Our father,
      who art in heaven--

                   Oh, Will.

      Hallowed be thy name.

        Thy kingdom come.

   Thy will be done on earth
   as it is in heaven.

    <i> Man: In local weather,</i>
    <i> I understand</i>

    <i> you have some bad news</i>
    <i> for us, Lisa.</i>

<i>Well, you're right</i>
<i>as always, David.</i>

<i>It looks like</i>
<i>a wet night here</i>

<i>in central</i>
<i>and southern Idaho--</i>

            What the?

<i>...with a squall</i>
<i>moving down--</i>

    What are you doing here?

      Why didn't you call?

           She didn't tell you.

              What?

      - What?
      - I'm staying here.

    - No, she's not staying.
    - You're staying?

      - I'm staying here.
      - You are not.

  I'll put on a pot of coffee,
  and we'll talk about this.

            I am not talking
            about anything.

            I am exhausted.
            I'm going to bed,

      and tomorrow morning, I am
      flying back to the city,

            and Dulcie
            is coming with me.

                    The end.

         I am using the bedroom,
         Stephen.

   - You sleep on the couch.
   - Stop!

You can't do that.

You can't come
into my house and do that.

If Dulcie wants to stay,

we'll sit down,
and we'll talk about it.

        But she is not staying.

And you know what?
Maybe she should stay.

I can see what this place
is doing for her.

         - Oh, please.
         - The place.

    Forget me. Look at her
    and tell me I'm wrong.

            I don't have to
            tell you anything.

Tell me this lousy little
farm isn't good for her.

            I don't have to
            tell you anything

            because she's mine
            legally.

    Oh. Don't give me legal.

    Just tell me the last time

      she did anything
      for you willingly--

     cooked a can of soup,
     anything,

    or just sat
    and watched TV with you.

              I'm going to bed.

And didn't hate you.

               Oh.

           [knocking]

Do you know
why she can't stay here?

                        Why?

    Because...

I'll be alone then.

There won't be anybody
in my house--

    no child...

no man...just me--

and I don't think
I can stand that.

        But if you take Dulcie,
        I'll be alone.

            That's what I was
            for ten years.

           No sounds when I came
           in the house.

            Nobody else's dishes
            in the sink.

     No one to cook dinner for,

    and you know what I thought
    about all the time?

        Remember
        when Dulcie was little?

        She'd play in the sink,

      standing on that red stool
      you bought her,

    pouring water back and forth
    and singing to herself.

      I was at your front door.

         Once, a long time ago.

            Did you know that?

               No.

       I could've walked in,
       and we'd be a family now,

      and I wouldn't be alone,
      and I wouldn't have this--

       this regret
       that I cannot get rid of,

            this regret that
            I failed you both

       because it was my fault.

            Not yours, Angela.

             And...

        And no matter
        how foolish it was,

    I still kept thinking maybe
    someday they'll come home.

        One day
        they'll walk in my door,

            and it'll all be
            like it was before,

       and then...Dulcie walks
       right in out of the blue,

          and then you walk in,

        and I let myself think
        "Could it be?

        Is it...possible
        she's coming back, too?"

           And it'll all be
           like it was before...

           because...

           you see...

         the thing is...

           I love you.

          And that's the truth,

           and we always told
           each other the truth.

     I never stopped loving you,
     even when I hated you.

        You have my heart.

            I gave it to you
            when I was young,

       and I can't get it back.

      Is that you, Stephen?

   Because I remember someone
    from a thousand years ago

        with that voice.

    But I'd forgotten that
    his words could be so--

                    What?

        Sweet.

        So sweet.

            [thunder]

         [wind howling]

                    Hmm.

            Cold.

           I'm sorry.

              Here.

          Mmm. I remember this.

        Raise your arms.

          High school football.

           Third string center.

Stole it.

                  I can't stay.

    I know.

            I made a life there.
            I have clients.

    I know.

         I have 43 cases
         right now.

          I just can't
          abandon them.

    I know.

    I know.

                    But, um...

               Dulcie can stay.

           Of course.

      It is better for her here.
      I know that.

         I do. I just--

                    I know it.

            I don't want to go.

            I want to stay here
            with you.

        And I want things
        just the way they were.

            Dulcie
            playing in the sink,

            just a little girl
            with no problems.

         And this place,

        like it was,
        exactly the way it was.

            And you.

          Oh, and you.

          Oh, Stephen,

             I love this place.

           I loved it.

    And...

should I come and take
you home this time?

              Um--

          [door closes]

    I'm not looking. I just--

    I thought you should know

  that I actually got dressed
  and went outside,

  and the fence is down again,

      and the stupid cows
      are everywhere,

      and it's a freakin'
      cyclone out there.

              Jeez.

            You know,

        if I'm the responsible
        one around here,

    then we're in deep trouble.

        You need a new fence.

I can't afford toilet paper.

           Look there.

           Here, boss.

        Here, boss. Here, girl.

Well, start back.
They'll follow.

            No kidding, captain.
            Here, boss.

    Um, Captain,
    I'm freezing.

All right. Then help me
with the fence,

and I'll put whiskey
in the hot toddy.

                        Deal.

             Thanks.

           Here, girl.

     Here, boss. Here, boss.

            Come on.

Here, girl.

Come on.

Here, girl.

                    Come on.

Here, boss. Here, boss.

    Here, boss.

Here, boss. Here, boss.

            - Dulcie!
           - Come on.

         - Here, boss.
         - [clatter]

             Dulcie!

           Here, boss.

        [sustained honk]

     [thump, brakes screech]

Dulcie, are you all right?

Sweetheart,
are you all right?

              Yeah.

            Is she dead?

         She was pregnant, too.

        [sobbing]

      Oh, baby. It's okay.

        It's okay.

            I guess I gotta
            get her in the barn.

            I have to dress her
            her out.

       I have to dress her
       so the meat doesn't spoil

            before I get her
            to the butcher.

          - I have to.
          - I know.

          I'll get the tractor.

    I'll get it.

I'll get it. I'll do it.

           What we're gonna do
           is hoist her on that.

              Yeah.

           We'll drive the truck
           in under her

              and then drop her
              down onto the bed

              after I dress her.
              Come on.

    Okay.

[motor stalls]

[motor stops]

      Starting to remember
      why you left?

    Easy, Dulce. This outfit's
    meant for hay bales.

    Go on back.

        Easy.

        Go on back.

                    Back.

                        Easy.

           That's it.

            Hold it!

         [horn honking]

    Dulcie?

    Baby, you okay?

     Uh, sorry. Sorry, man.
     Four wheel drive.

        You didn't have to come,
        Roxanne.

It's all right.

                All right, Will.
                Bring it back.

            Slowly.
            That's right. Easy.

                Straight back.
                Yeah, that's it.

      - [pulleys creaking]
      - Stephen.

                    Hold it!

                  That's right.

                 Everybody,
                 now stay clear.

    We'll do this real quick.

       I hate this.

            Nice cut.

   Get off. Stephen, get off.
   Get down.

       - Watch the chain.
       - Uh, yeah.

             What--

          It's moving.

         It's the calf.

               No, it can't be.

          - Daddy.
          - [creaking]

             Daddy!

             [gasp]

         - Dulcie, no.
         - Dulcie!

      - Help me. Help me.
      - Be careful.

     - Let's get it quick.
     - Stephen.

            - Hurry.
             - Okay,

   we'll pull this side open.

   - Dulcie, grab this side.
   - Will, be careful.

      - Angela: Hurry up.
      - Pull it open.

        - There you go.
        - Hurry up.

          - Okay.
          - The chain.

     - Hurry, guys, hurry.
     - Careful.

    - Will: Got it, Dulce?
    - Pull it, Dulcie. Open.

     - Angela: Get it out.
     - You got it?

    Get it out. Get it out.
    It's not gonna hold.

       - Will: I got it.
       - Stephen: Here.

     - Angela: Come on.
     - Dulcie: Is it okay?

        Watch your head.

       - Hurry up, guys.
       - Come on.

     - Get her away from--
     - It's slippery.

           - Come on.
           - Easy.

   - Watch your head, Dulcie.
   - Will: Down easy.

          - Down easy.
          - I got her.

    - There.
    - Angela: Get her down.

            Dulcie: Is he okay?

I got her chest.
Take the fluid out.

Got her head?

            [gasping]

    Ohh.

        Come on. Come on.

       Come on, hurry up.

      - You got it, Will?
      - Yeah.

Okay. That's it, Dulcie.
Hold her head.

          - I got it.
          - Oh.

              Come on.
              Let's warm her up.

       - Rub her down.
       - Come on, please.

  - Will: Is it clearing out?
  - Yeah.

           Here, baby.

         - Keep pushing.
        - Come on, girl.

         Come on, girl.

    - I'm gonna try a straw.
    - In her nose.

       - Come on.
       - Jam it. Jam it.

I'm trying.

   - Breathe.
   - Come on, girl. Come on.

            Come on.

           - Breathe.
           - Come on.

          - Yeah.
          - [laughter]

She made it.

There you go, girl.

        Will: Look at it.

               Oh, look at her.

Nice heifer.

                        Yeah.

                    Hi.

            Oh, what a sweetie.

         She likes you.

   Of course she does.
   What's not to like, right?

           Here you are, Dulce.

           Here, girl.

          Ready? Go. That's it.

          There you go.

                        Wow.

          I'd better
          get the cow into town.

            Thanks. Red truck.

        Wait.

   Come on,
   you got to get some milk.

               Isn't that cute?

            Drink.

There we go, girl.

    Whoa.
