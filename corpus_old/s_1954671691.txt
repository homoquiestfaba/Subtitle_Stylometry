Yo, it's Nick.

     Photographer,
     artist, entrepreneur.

Stop that shit.

Nick, it's Lily.

             Again.

     Umm, it's been almost
     an hour, I need you

    to come out and grab me.

      No, I'm on the list!

        I'm on the list!

              Hey.

      - How come you never
      answer my texts?

            - Sorry.

     - I thought you'd have
     something more to say

  than sorry, but I guess not.

     Hey, are you coming to
     TJ's tomorrow night?

            - TJ's?

          - Yeah, TJ.

      God, I want you guys
      to like each other.

      - We do, Bea, I do.

     - So you'll be there?

    - Well, I mean I'll try.

    I already promised that
    I'd drop by this thing--

          - With Nick?

 Yeah, Lily, you're a fallback.

         - Hello, Lil.

       - I need a drink.

      - I'm a little
      busy at the moment.

       - I could jump in
       front of a bus.

        - I'll be there.

  - Can you spare some change?

     - I'm the one that
     needs change, mister.

          - Fuck you!

          - Guess who?

  - I didn't see you come in.

 - Now what fun would that be?

Let's
   start from the beginning.

    - Umm, I'm Lily, I'm
    23, I umm, just recently

    graduated from FIT, and
    I have this best friend,

      she's kind of my
      favorite thing in--

Let's
      talk about Nick.

     - Umm, I don't know,
     he's kind of amazing.

   He's probably the sweetest
   guy I've ever met.

What
       about your job?

   - I mean, it's in fashion.

        So, that's good.

             And...

      I'm learning a lot.

Good morning.

       You don't have AC.

           - Thanks.

 Why are we talking like this?

   - This is how we talk now.

          I need food.

              Now.

       - What do you want
       for breakfast?

       I guess anything.

           Pancakes.

             - So.

 What are you wearing tonight?

             - Huh?

     - Thank you for that.

         You are going.

            - Am I?

      - If I have to club
      and sack you myself.

        - How much fun?

          - Extremely.

        Astonishingly...

        Breathtakingly.

            - Fancy.

         I gotta work.

 - When are you going to quit?

   - I can't, I have to
   maintain lavish lifestyle.

              Mmm.

So, I heard about last night.

       That wasn't nice.

  - What exactly did you hear?

        - You and Nick.

      I mean I guess it's
      just inevitable.

       Eventually we all
       just drift apart.

   Because like, that's what
   the universe is doing.

           You know?

      Drifting, fading...

       Dying, that's it.

      And then one day you
      wake up and realize

   you're dating a
   meteorite, when all a girl

       really wants is
       to be whisked off

 by a shooting star, you know?

      - I thought they
      were the same thing?

        - The point is.

 You have the dream, we all do.

      And eventually,
      you have to grow up

    and settle for something
    more realistic.

      Like, a quarry rock.

Or worse, like the Hideki rock.

      Like the kind you
      find in one of those

    sad in-flight magazines.

      - Yeah, you lost me.

 - That's life for most people.

       I mean, not ours
       of course, but...

        For most people.

     - Yeah, but I mean...

     What actually gets
     like, better with age?

           - Hmmm...

 My vintage motorcycle jacket.

            - Right.

    - Oh, so Jess posted
    pictures of last night.

      And it appears you
      checked in at Canopy

      around 11, eat, and
      then you were back

    in BK 30 minutes later,
    it all makes sense now.

      You know, you really
      should work on

     a more socially viable
     virtual reputation.

  - No wait, what makes sense?

       - Nick, all over
       this model chick.

 That's why you left, isn't it?

           - No, I...

       No, I mean, that's
       like, his job.

      - Yeah, but it's the
      same one every time.

  - Umm, Ben isn't here is he?

      - I don't know,
      he's separated now,

  he kinda does what he wants.

          - Good day?

       - Umm yeah, it's
       actually really--

            - 2,100.

   - Uh-huh, and what's
   Donna doing on the ticker?

   - Up actually, it's 18.25.

  - Uh-huh, and the inventory?

      - In transit with an
      estimated delivery--

     - Can I get some Coke?

       - 15 minutes ago.

Hey baby, it's Nick.

    Listen, I feel like such
    shit about last night,

  like seriously, shit just...

     I don't know, shit
     just got mighty crazy,

     you know how fucked up
     my schedule can get,

       but you know, work
       now, live later.

   I know you probably looked
   hot as shit last night.

    Tell you what, uhh,
    drop by my show tonight,

  kay, give me a ring, we
  can make up for last night.

        - So, shall we?

       - I can't, and I
       want to see Nick.

    - Are you being serious?

     - Yes, but, Beatriz
     is having people over,

   so we could go over
   there and still have fun.

          Oh, come on.

            Please?

            Please?

            - Fine.

          I'd fuck me.

        - I'd fuck you.

           - Really?

  - Well yeah, if I was a guy.

       I'd stick my penis
       in your vagina.

            Totally.

        - Well, thanks.

   - -And she's in the
   shower, completely naked,

          and she's...

    and she's just, you
    know, waiting for Nick,

     to go and switch over
     his film or whatever

       bullshit excuse he
       made up to leave,

    and then it wasn't until
    delivery guy turns up

that she thought wait a minute,

   I wonder if Nick's
   actually arrived back yet?

     And of course, he was
     nowhere to be found.

   - This is supposed to be
   something about yourself.

     - It is, I was there.

    - You are an absolute--

     He was, he was trying
     to get material

for his portfolio, because
he's trying to find and agent--

            - Lily!

     It was material for
     his fucking wank bank!

  - It was, why are you trying
  to make excuses for him?

     - He's a very
     serious photographer.

       And he had to go
       because he had...

   I, no, but, really,
   really, it was very sweet,

   and he felt very bad that
   he had to leave afterwards

      and he came back and
      he made me dinner

     and he apologized, it
     was really very sweet,

     and so you know, those
     kind of things hap--

             Whoa.

     Oooo, secret, secret.

 - Uh no it's, I have something

  really exciting to tell you.

     - Really, what is it?

     - It's wonderful news.

Alright,
    can everyone quiet down

      a little bit please?

 - Promise you won't freak out.

       - Okay, I mean...

  - Everyone shut the fuck up!

            - Okay.

            So, yes.

       I have some really
       exciting news.

       I am pleased to
       say, my time here,

    in this wonderful city,
    has been quite amazing.

      And it wouldn't have
      been half as amazing

       without you guys
       being part of it.

      So, it is with great
      sadness that I say,

  I will not be taking
  residence here much longer.

     I have a job in London
     with my dad's label

   and I am, sadly, leaving.

         In seven days.

       This is my last
       week in New York.

     - I'm excited for you
     man, that's awesome.

     I'll miss you, though.

        - Just a minute!

      - That is really
      crazy but, what else

       would you expect?

          That's that.

      - Yep, I guess she
      just needed change.

I bet she won't even miss us.

     - You'd be surprised.

        - Are you okay?

       You look like your
       dog just died.

      - No, no, I'm fine.

     - Hey, how's it going?

         We'll see ya.

When
       did you meet Kat?

       - Four years ago.

   We were roommates at FIT.

How
       would you describe

      your time together?

  - Well, I think she actually
  learned a lot from me.

             So...

  I mean, I'm not saying that
  Kat like, isn't smart, but,

     she just might be
     kind of disadvantaged.

     From all of the drugs.

Is this a
  period that she's overcome?

         - Yes and no.

     It's hard to tell with
     those kinds of people.

You
       don't seem to have

     a high opinion of her.

         - No, it's...

    Okay, so, this is gonna
    sound really horrible,

      but umm, when I say
      eight and a half,

      Kat thinks I mean
      penis size, so yeah,

        it's pretty hard
        to talk with her

about anything that's, anything.

I'm assuming
  you're not excited for her.

       of people to fuck,
       that's awesome.

So you
   don't feel happy for her?

    - I mean it's not like
    it even fucking matters.

       I don't need her.

Why didn't
  you tell her off right then?

   - God, can we please talk
   about something else?

Okay.

 So you hit a car with a beer.

      Tell us about that.

 - I was imagining Kat's head.

        - What is this?

          Sunglasses?

      - It's a long story.

   I flew over a few blocks
   to Agatha's peaceful tree,

     hard-working bird, but
     lately I've sucked,

       and I need to pull
       my shit together.

   And tell Agatha thank you,
   for I owe you my life.

Tell me something good, tell me

     you brought me coffee.

          - I did not.

    - I genuinely hope this
    is some sort of phase.

      Awesome, you're
      hilarious, now get.

        - There you are.

     So we should, I mean,
     I can understand

      how you're feeling.

    - I don't think you do.

     - I know it sucks, but
     this is huge for me.

  You have to understand that.

      You're going to
      start your own line,

   it will be fucking
   awesome, I know it'll be.

   This is going to work out.

  - Can you just postpone it?

       I can't, they'll
       get someone else.

      This is a career
      move, how could you

      not understand that?

          - I get it.

  - Then what's the big deal?

 You're going to be big, Lily.

I knew it since the day we met.

          No, really.

  We'll make the best of this.

           - I know.

      - I hope I can make
      you feel better.

     I want you to come to
     this art show tonight.

  - Okay, I'll think about it.

      - There are a lot of
      interesting people.

    - Umm, so, the 17th,
    that's a Friday, right?

            - Yeah.

     More than enough time
     for us to have fun.

    It'll be like
    sophomore year in Cabo.

         Remember Cabo?

     - Oh, I'm sorry, that
     was the text, not you.

Yo, little mama!

Hey, where
   you been, how's your girl?

Right, right
   right right, cool cool.

      Listen, I met this
      guy, total cokehead

    but super down-to-earth,
    he's got this

   huge Paris-based line,
   it's like crazy high-end.

      Anyway I'm shooting
      his look book

      and we totally hit
      it off, he takes me

   to some fucking penthouse
   and we do some coke,

       I tell him that
       you're in fashion

  so I got you like a
  shitload of contacts, and...

            - Okay.

I was really
     just thinking of you,

   and you know, I just want
   to respect you and shit,

   and I don't think I'm
   doing a good job at that.

 You gotta excuse me, I am a
 high mother fucker right now.

You don't seem
  excited about the art show.

      - Well that's
      really unfortunate.

What do
   you expect to say to Kat?

       - I mean that's if
       she even shows up.

She said she'd
  make the best of things.

        - Yeah, for her.

  Doesn't exactly include me.

I
      believe you and Kat

have a history at art galleries?

         - Yeah, we do.

Tell me about it.

            - Umm...

   I don't know, we would...

     We'd like always umm,
     go as characters.

     Like we'd, pretend
     to be French students

 and then anyone you would meet

     at the gallery, you'd
     keep on going with it.

   I mean Kat always thought
   it was fucking hysterical.

              I...

       There was this
       one time we umm...

    We ended up back at this
    photographer's apartment

    and like, I don't know,
    we were pretending

  to be British but my accents
  are really, really bad.

      And I'm pretty sure
      he know that it was

    complete bullshit,
    because I kept on like,

just saying these insane things.

   Like, righto and cheeri-o.

             Umm...

    I don't know, Kat
    couldn't stop laughing.

  But he might have been too
  fucked up to really notice.

     - Dude, not supposed
     to touch the artwork.

          - Of course.

      I feel really stupid
      right now, sorry.

          - It's fine.

      Are you having fun?

  - Yeah, it's a great space.

         - Yeah, yeah.

    What about the artwork?

       What do you think?

   - It's pretty terrifying.

            - Yeah.

        What about this?

       This is beautiful.

    - Yeah I mean I guess...

   Well you know style-wise,
   I can see that but,

       I don't know, it
       just feels kind of

       predictable, like
       how do you know

     that it's not a ripoff
     of something else?

 I think that if something has
 meaning, then it's beautiful.

    But that's just my take.

I don't know, it kind of feels

     like all style to me.

     - Who's to say style
     can't have substance?

     Did you come here
     with someone tonight?

        What do you do?

            - Guess.

            - Uh...

       You're a waitress.

   - I can't believe you said
   that, umm no acutally,

        I am in fashion.

        - Oh, of course.

   - I work at this boutique
   in Soho right now,

         I Don't Know.

        - I don't know?

   No, that's the name of the
   boutique, I Don't Know.

            - Right.

        Do you like it?

        - I don't know.

     No, I mean it's, it's
     fine, it's whatever,

          it's a job.

      I guess I just
      would really rather

       own my own store.

     - So does that mean
     that you don't create

         your own work?

  - No, I mean I tried, didn't
  really work out perfect.

   I guess I'm not very good.

     - I'm sorry but that
     is complete bullshit.

     I mean why else would
     you into that medium?

   To collect a bunch of old
   shit from other people,

        that's not art.

    I mean, the whole reason
    why you got into fashion

    was to create something,
    to leave it behind.

     I mean that's why we
     all get to be artists.

     You know what I think?

    I think that you're
    afraid of being judged.

       That has something
       to do with it.

             What?

       Tell me I'm wrong.

        - You're wrong.

            - Right.

         No, no, right.

      Coming from the
      girl that just said

  that my painting was empty.

              Hi.

           I'm Henri.

      - I've been looking
      for you everywhere.

             - Hi.

             - Kat?

   - No, no sorry, I'm Lily.

           This is--

             - Kat.

       Nice to meet you.

           - You too.

We're going back
       to  baby,

       Henri, what's up?

     This fine lady is uh,
     Valentina, I love it.

       Two of them, nice
       bro, very nice.

      So, are they coming
      wi--actually,

    let's let the ladies
    make up their own minds,

  'cuz females, they're
  independent and intelligent,

       I'm Colin by the
       way, how are you?

            - Uhh...

      - Okay, how about
      you go get us a cab?

         - Absolutely.

           Love you!

           Big cock.

     - Okay, so that's
     someone that you know.

      - Yeah, yeah it is.

Regrettably.
         - Wow.

          - Goodness.

            - Yeah.

Hey, let me give you my number.

        - Okay, umm....

      - Here, let me uh...

        Let me help you.

 Do you want to come to a party

 and you can bring your friend?

       - Oh, shit, no, I
       work really late.

        - Not this late.

Let's go!

       Come on, let's go.

      Call her, call her.

  - That's just fucking weird.

       - It was kind of--

   Okay it is a little weird.

It's a little weird.

       - As if I would be
       impressed by that,

    I mean you know who my
    godfather is, seriously.

        Where we off to?

     - I'm gonna head home.

             - Boo!

            - What?

       I had a fun night.

       I just want to go
       home and crash.

             - Lil.

 - I'll see you in the morning.

    Try to come before noon?

Sure, fine, whatever you need.

    See you in the morning.

       - What time is it?

      - It's before noon.

      Why is everything
      so god damn bright?

  - Because this is what we
  normal people call day time.

          - Come down.

 - I've got some of your
 shit, I packed it up for you,

  I thought you might need it.

           - Pass it.

       Bring it with you.

           - Selling?

             - Yep.

          All of this.

       So, I have a bunch
       of other things

  I was going to sell, but I
  think you should have them.

      - Thanks, as long
      as I can sell them.

    - Why would you do that?

  - Jeez, I was just kidding.

       - So, how's Nick?

        - Nick is good.

        - You never told
        me what happened

     after he stood you up.

     - You're selling this?

     - It's lovely, but I
     don't wear it enough.

 - I bought this for you, Kat.

           - Did you?

  - It's funky and I like it.

 - Then keep it, I don't care.

      - You keeping this?

       - Happy Christmas.

          - Kat, I...

      - So the total comes
      to 954 dollars.

            - Super.

Let's
    talk about your career.

        - What about it?

Do you enjoy
   where you're working?

    - Umm, am I a masochist?

Is that what
   you consider Agatha to be?

           - Umm, no.

   I think the only thing
   that could possibly bring

  her pleasure is black
  leather against her thighs.

How do you see
  yourself when you're old?

Don't you want
  to create your own line?

      - Well yeah, but, I
      don't really think

  that's an option right now.

       I mean if you know
       anyone who wants

to give money to a 23-year-old,
please let me know.

Then would
    you say you're stuck?

         - No, umm....

  God, you're making this out
  so much worse than it is,

          it's just...

   Okay, so maybe the
   boutique is cold and dead

      and lifeless, but
      I mean, I am making

    a lot of great
    contacts that I can use

       later in my life.

Do you
      really mean that?

             - No.

Let's
      talk about Henri.

            - Let's.

Do you
   want to make love to him?

            - Umm...

     Maybe, sure, why not?

What do
     you look for in a guy?

     - Well, a career in
     fashion or art, film,

     photography, music, I
     mean I can't help it.

    I like guys who create.

      a fear of expressing
      yourself creatively?

             - Wow.

       Umm, I just went
       to fashion school,

       so I don't have a
       problem creating.

    I mean, like, it's just
    not my thing right now.

Uh-huh.

           - Really.

You know, I think I've made some

      really bold choices
      with my life.

Lily!

Lily, it's Nicky
   here, get your ass up.

     You got plans tonight?

      - What's the matter?

My boy Dan is deejaying

     at the club right now.

       Fucking DJ Dan,
       you met him what,

        like five times?

     Come on, come through.

           - Text me.

Yeah,
     fashion girl by day...

       - You look so hot.

    - Yeah, I thought you
    had a learning disorder.

           Oh my god.

   I have not stopped
   thinking about that night.

    - We don't have to talk
    about that, really.

       - I have to get
       this off my chest.

      Those models,
      they're all so tall,

 and beautiful, and flawlessly
 have those perfect--

  Whenever I was with them,
  I was just thinking of you.

      - Wait, I thought
      there was just one.

         - Oh, come on.

      If it rains, then
      everything gets wet.

  Does it really matter if it
  rains again an hour later?

            - What?

             Nick?

     - You know what I'm
     trying to say is that,

like a really, really soft man.

     - Wait, you slept with
     one of your models?

      - Oh my god, none of
      them compare, Lily,

  that's what I'm trying, mm--

              Hey.

      Remember what I said
      about eye contact.

Hey, make some waffles.

 - I can't, I have to go home.

      - No, come on, make
      some waffles first.

    - I have to go to work.

        - Well then, I'm
        coming with you.

            - Nick.

           - Come on!

     How much do you work?

    - No, I don't think so.

            - Jesus.

    There's so much day,
    see what you're wasting?

         - Wait, what?

         What is this?

        - That is a bra.

      Oh Jesus Lily,
      could you please not

    start this this morning?

           Oh my god.

       - You know what,
       I am taking this,

    because this is my face!

       - Oh Jesus Christ.

          - Fuck you.

              Oh!

             Shit.

Hi.

             - Mom?

I'm not available

     to take your call,
     please leave a message

  and I will get back to you.

Are you ready?

   So, let's talk about Nick.

     - Yeah, well that was
     obviously humiliating.

Then why
    do you put up with him?

     - I don't know, umm...

 I just want to be with someone

      who could do so
      much better than me.

Doesn't that
   put you in low regard?

 - No, it actually means that
 I have really high standards.

I see.

Yeah, glad we cleared that up.

You
       kind of seem to be

   going through a tailspin.

 - Well, call it what you will.

Where
      are your parents?

            - Umm...

       They're not here.

    They moved, they have
    better things going on.

Don't you
    feel like going home?

        - Do you want to
        get out of here?

No, I didn't know with the...

 I think I just didn't get it.

       - I understood it.

           - Did you?

      - I did, and it was
      fucking appalling.

             - Wow.

            - Yeah.

             - Wow.

            - Yeah.

       - Tell me what you
       really thought.

     - Do you have a light?

          - Uh, yeah.

     - So this is like
     what you're into then,

 like, standing around every...

   - Yeah every night, yeah.

     - Every single night.

    - I mean, I thought it
    was pretty interesting.

  I don't know, I guess I just
  didn't quite understand it.

          - Nice ring.

    - Oh, umm, thanks, it's
    actually pretty cool,

      it was my grandma's.

       My grandpa brought
       it back for her

       from World War II.

I'm like really into old things.

 There's actually, there's this

      amazing vintage
      place near my house

      and on the weekends
      sometimes I go there

       and I can just
       rummage for hours.

     - Yeah, you find some
     really cool stuff,

        don't you Lily?

            - Yeah.

     - You're a really
     great vintage shopper.

    - I guess, I don't know.

            - Yeah.

       She found this
       amazing coat once.

   Do you remember the coat?

What coat?

          - What coat?

      - Okay, it's time
      to hear this story.

             - Yes.

Okay, so Lily found this coat,

      this time she bought
      this coat, she spent

     probably about 350
     dollars on this coat,

        which, you know,
        is a really fine

    amount of money to
    spend if it's you know,

   one of a kind, vintage,
   lovely, old, unique piece.

And then a couple of weeks later

       we were walking
       down Fifth Avenue,

   and we see the same coat,

No, the same coat?
  - In the window

  of a department store, yeah.

       And it was on sale
       for about maybe

a third of what she paid for it.

   She just got ripped off
   by some flea market twat.

 Pretty fucking bad mistake
 for a fashion student to make.

  - Hey, do you know if
  there's a bathroom in here?

    - Oh, I don't think so.

             - Oh.

     Okay, I, well, I'm
     gonna try to go find--

          Don't move.

            - Okay.

     - I'll be right back!

             - Yo!

       - Someone's in the
       fucking bathroom.

So uh,
    where's your girlfriend?

I don't know,
  she's never been like this.

             - So?

        What did you do?

      - Fuck off, I
      didn't do anything!

     She's so overdramatic.

       She's adorable
       though, isn't she?

           - She is.

             - Hey.

Hello.

        - You will never
        guess who I saw.

             - Who?

       - Your ex, Erasus.

      I mean, you remember
      Erasus, don't you?

         - I do, Lily.

    - He was such a racist.

      - He wasn't racist.

      - Then what was he?

         - An asshole.

      - I mean I guess
      you wouldn't really

     remember that though,
     since you were

just blacking out all the time.

          - Excuse me?

 - I mean, I'm just saying that

       you were into some
       really dark shit.

     - Yeah, I was, thanks
     for bringing it up.

  - So uh, buried or cremated?

Buried.
       - Cremated.

       - The way I see
       it you can choose.

    You can either be a
    turban, or a bobby pin.

       I mean, sure one
       is fun and flashy,

       but it goes out of
       style like that.

    Bobby pins are a bore,
    but they're dependable.

     They get the job done.

  No fussing with the trends,

    just invisible fixtures,
    doing their job.

 And like, I know a lot of guys

    who secretly wish they
    could borrow hairstyles

      or styles from a
      genre not their own.

           - Uh-huh.

       - They can't, like
       the lawyer, who is

     afraid of what the
     firm's senior partners

      or even his cleaning
      lady might think.

       Will they wonder,
       is he a pedophile?

           Or worse?

        Like a hipster?

           - Aaargh!

  - Are you having a bad day?

Hello?

 - Hey, hey, hi, Henri it's...

        Uh, yeah, sorry.

             Umm...

       Yeah, so I got
       out of work early,

     do you want to like
     grab a drink or some--

             Yeah.

     No, that sounds great.

I can be over there in a little,

I just have to drop by my place.

             Yeah.

    Okay, I'll see you soon.

              Bye.

             - Hey.

              Hey.

             - Hey.

   Yeah man, yeah yeah yeah,
   I'm just finishing up,

   and then I'm out the door.

         Alright, yeah.

       Sorry, I gotta go.

     But uh, I mean you can
     stay here if you want.

             Or...

         Come with me.

          - Have fun?

 - What are you talking about?

      - Henri texted, said
      he was with you.

       - We ran into each
       other after work.

          - How cute.

      You're like a little
      porcelain doll.

     - So, what do you want
     to get into tonight?

         I'm not tired.

    - Hmm, now that the
    night's properly fucked,

   I'm gonna bug off to bed.

      - It's not even 10.

 - I'll see you tomorrow night.

What
     are you smiling about?

I've never been
finger-painted by a guy before.

Are you in love?

        - Ummm, I guess.

Are you
     bothered by the fact

  that Kat only has two days?

           - Really?

  - So where the fuck's Henri?

             - Hey.

  Glad you decided to stop by.

      - Sorry we're late.

     No, welcome, welcome.

   I mean we barely started.

    Here, looks like you
    could use one of these.

     Well listen, if things
     get too extreme,

     I want you to tell me.

I feel responsible for you two.

    - Okay, yeah, seems
    like pretty crazy here.

      - Good, well, enjoy.

     - So my mother
     thinks that it's like

     a fun mother-daughter
     bonding thing.

  She should take me to go
  and see a psychic with her.

    Like, I know, seriously,
    I mean the last--

    I mean, I don't want to
    go see a psychic anyway,

    let alone with my
    mother, can you imagine?

  I mean what might, like what
  might come out, you know?

        In front of her,
        and I don't want

   to know her stuff,
   either, I mean seriously,

      my mother's lovely.

    - So you're in fashion?

         - Yeah, I am.

      - Oh, I think
      fashion's pointless.

       - Two, three more?

          Three more.

   - Oh, here, I'll help you.

       - You didn't even
       finish that one.

             - Hey.

             - Hey.

       - You having fun?

       - Yeah, this is an
       amazing apartment.

       I really like the
       Christmas lights.

            - Yeah.

  You know, you can tell me
  if Colin's being an asshole.

             - No.

No, I mean he's just, you know,

      like, really witty.

 Okay, he's kind of an asshole.

      - Yeah, yeah he is.

            Mmm-hmm.

       So uh, you know
       how to make these?

   - I think I can handle it.

            - Yeah?

           - Mmm-hmm.

           - Alright.

          - Say when.

         - When, when!

      Okay, okay, alright.

   Are you trying to trip me?

             - No.

Look, you can just tell me
that you want to fuck me, Lily.

           Or don't.

     But quit it with this
     grade school shit.

Okay, yeah.

      I'm a bit over
      this Henry, I think

    we need a bit of volume.

     Alright, we can either
     take one of these

    pretty blue pills or
    you can get the fuck out

       of Henry's house.

         Ladies first.

      Everybody take one.

            And one.

            And uno.

      And uh, one for you.

      Last but not least.

      Henri I'll see you
      in about two hours.

             Enjoy.

      - I know I've been
      really weird lately.

   But I just wanted to say
   I'm really happy for you.

Well that's wonderful to hear.

       Tell us about your
       last girlfriend.

           - Aaahhh.

        There's not much
        to tell, really.

             Umm...

 I was in love with her, and...

         Then I wasn't.

        - Was she a 10?

         - You're a 10.

   If I put you two together.

     Is everybody alright?

           - Mmm-hmm.

   - I want to kiss you both.

            - Well?

            - Fuck.

   - Good morning, pussycat.

        - What is that?

      - Please, tell me if
      I'm doing something

       fucked up here,
       I'd like to know.

   - I'm not talking to you.

           - Why not?

    - That means you made
    Henri blow you so long,

 he fell asleep on your vagina.

 - Okay, so this is about him?

     It's about you then,
     it's always about you.

      - Why did you do it?

     - What did you expect?

      Lily, listen, do you
      think I'd be pissed

         if it was you?

       - Do not touch me.

       - Don't ruin this.

I keep trying to make this fun,

this whole summer, and you keep

      fucking ruining it.

    - Wait, are you serious?

   I'm the one ruining this?

      Kat, you ruined
      everything, you are

actually destroying everything!

 - What are you talking about?

     - You hurt me and
     you betrayed me, Kat!

    And if you really felt
    so fucking bad about it,

       you wouldn't even
       consider leaving.

  - I didn't know I hurt you.

     - Yeah, well you hurt
     me really fucking bad.

     It hurts like hell,
     okay, and you keep on

      saying that I'm the
      one ruining this?

      We spent four years
      pretending that

  we were going to completely
  take over the world,

   and then like, completely,
   out of the blue,

    you tell me that you're
    moving to England

         a week before?

     And you're not moving
     for a job, okay,

 just stop fucking saying that.

     You are moving because
     you are scared.

      And because you're
      bored and it's easy,

  and you're bored and you
  don't know what else to do.

       And it's just so
       easy to move, when

     all you really think
     about is getting drunk

        and getting high
        and getting laid

      and having fun, and
      you know what Kat?

    That's because you don't
    really do anything.

 You don't fucking do anything!

     And nobody else seems
     to really realize it,

 because you have this awesome
 fucking British accent.

     It's like bollocks,
     I'm packed, and I can

     do whatever I want,
     cheeri-o, and I can be

 split and tipping and fucking

        going all around
        tra la la la la,

but because I'm blonde and hot,

  people think I'm whimsical.

     It's all, oh, righty-o
     why don't I just

  go ahead and fuck everyone!

   And I mean that literally
   and figuratively,

    Kat, you fuck everyone.

       - I never, never
       meant to hurt you.

You hurt me all the time, Kat.

       Whenever it makes
       you feel better.

  Don't fucking do that again!

Describe your
  friendship in one word.

       - That's a really
       stupid question.

I'm just
     trying to understand.

            - Umm...

       I mean it's not
       that complicated.

    We were really close and
    then she fucked it up.

You're
    coming tomorrow, right?

Coming to what?

   - Kat's going away thing.

         - Where is it?

 - I assumed you organized it.

       - Yeah, we'll see.

She's your best friend, Lily.

  You can't just not be there.

             - You.

            - Lily.

   I came here to apologize.

           - Really?

         Tell me more.

      - Well, we promised
      that you wouldn't

       let your shit get
       in the way of us?

      - You're the one
      that's full of shit!

   - Oh come on, I know that
   you don't believe that.

  - Get the fuck out of here.

    - I'm sorry, that is not
    how we speak to clients.

     - Eat a dick, Agatha!

      - I think it's safe
      to assume you don't

    want to be here anymore.

I mean you're bored, you're....

  I don't know, what are you?

             - 23.

             - 23.

    You feel like you should
    be doing something,

           exciting.

  - That's not the way it is.

        - Oh, no, it is.

    I see what goes on here.

      My last job sucked
      the life out of me.

      That's why I hire
      people like Agatha.

     Nothing left to suck.

           You know.

     So I'm gonna fire you.

   And look, I say go for it.

    Get your hands dirty,
    get poor, get desperate,

     try ecstasy, do coke.

     Get fucking dangerous.

      40, with kids, and a
      miserable mortgage.

Now's the time to fucking live.

      Now I know you, are
      having, proble--

      Where are you going?

          - Holy fuck!

            Really?

            Really.

         Get back here!

I wanted
       to say goodbye.

 The plane leaves in two hours.

   Anything you want to say?

Not this time, my love.

Have
      you stayed in touch?

            - Yeah.

       We talk sometimes.

How
      are you feeling now?

    - Really good, actually.

      I don't know, I
      think that sometimes

    you have to split
    apart in order to grow.

          Or grow up.

And is
     that the profound note

      you want to end on?

     - I mean, who says
     that this is the end?
