â™« Morgu, Morgu, three times three

â™« Hear the words I ask of thee

(slow piano music)

That's it.

I'll see you at the new place, okay?

Thank you.

â™« Grant me vision, grant me power

â™« Cheer me in my darkest hour

(tense music)

I need you.

Ashley, we have to get going.

The moving truck is already gone.

(slow, tense music)

Ashley, enough.

Come on.

No.

No!

No!

You can't sell this place,

you can't take me away from here!

(slow, tense music)


Unleash the power of the ancients with

this protection spell.

The guardian of the house must stay.

She shall never leave.

(slow, tense music)

Ashley, please.

(tense, dramatic music)

Ashley, please.



(slow, tense music)

(Ashley humming)


(tense, dramatic music)

Oh shit!

Jessa! We gotta fuck go, we gotta go.

Fuck, shit, dude.

We need to get the fuck out of here.

Taylor has lost her mind.

(slow, tense music)
