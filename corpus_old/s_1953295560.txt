<i>Narrator: IN THE WORLD</i>
<i>OF</i> POKÃ©MON,

<i>THERE ARE AS MANY STORIES</i>

<i>AS THERE ARE THESE</i>
<i>INCREDIBLE CREATURES.</i>


<i>SOME REMAIN SECRET TO ALL</i>
<i>BUT A SELECT FEW.</i>

<i>OTHERS HAVE BECOME</i>
<i>THE STUFF OF LEGEND.</i>

<i>AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO</i>
<i>WERE BORN OF OUR DREAMS.</i>

RAHR!

<i>LIKE THE POKÃ©MON THEMSELVES,</i>

<i>THESE TALES HAVE SURVIVED</i>
<i>THE TEST OF TIME.</i>


<i>AND WITH EACH PASSING DAY,</i>
<i>COUNTLESS ADVENTURES UNFOLD--</i>

<i>FROM THE TOP OF THE WORLD</i>
<i>TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.</i>

<i>THERE ARE</i>
<i>OVER 300 KNOWN SPECIES</i>

<i>THAT CONTINUOUSLY ADD</i>
<i>TO THE</i> POKÃ©MON <i>LORE.</i>

<i>BUT THEY DON'T DO IT ALONE.</i>

<i>HUMANS AND POKÃ©MON</i>
<i>OFTEN TEAM UP</i>

<i>FOR SPORTING COMPETITIONS.</i>

<i>BY COMBINING STRENGTH,</i>
<i>COURAGE, WISDOM, AND TRUST,</i>

<i>THE PARTNERS HOPE</i>
<i>TO EMERGE VICTORIOUS</i>

<i>IN WHAT ARE KNOWN</i>
<i>AS POKÃ©MON BATTLES.</i>

<i>TOGETHER, POKÃ©MON AND HUMANS</i>
<i>SHARE THE WORLD</i>

<i>IN FRIENDSHIP, PEACE,</i>
<i>AND HARMONY.</i>

<i>BUT NOT ALL INTENTIONS</i>
<i>ARE PURE.</i>

RAHR!

<i>THERE ARE THOSE WHO</i>
<i>WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE</i>

<i>OF THE MOST FEARSOME POKÃ©MON</i>

<i>TO ACHIEVE GOALS OF CONTROL,</i>
<i>DOMINATION, AND POWER.</i>

<i>GROUDON, AN ANCIENT POKÃ©MON,</i>

<i>IS SO COVETED</i>
<i>BY THE EVIL TEAM MAGMA.</i>

<i>AND THAT IS WHERE</i>
<i>OUR STORY BEGINS,</i>

<i>WITH A MISGUIDED SEARCH</i>
<i>BY A RELENTLESS MAN</i>

<i>HOPING TO FULFILL HIS</i>
<i>LIFELONG WISH FOR GROUDON.</i>


<i>AND WITH PIKACHU BY HIS SIDE,</i>
<i>HE'S WELL ON HIS WAY.</i>

<i>WHAT HE UNEARTHS INSTEAD</i>
<i>IS AN EVEN BIGGER MYSTERY</i>

<i>AND AN EVEN GREATER POWER</i>

<i>ASH KETCHUM HAS WISHES</i>
<i>OF HIS OWN.</i>

<i>TOGETHER, THEY TRAVEL</i>
<i>ON A POKÃ©MON JOURNEY,</i>

<i>MEETING ALONG THE WAY FRIENDS</i>

<i>WITH HOPES AND DREAMS</i>
<i>OF THEIR OWN:</i>

<i>TO DISCOVER NEW POKÃ©MON,</i>
<i>TO EXPLORE THE WORLD,</i>

<i>TO BECOME THE VERY BEST</i>
<i>TRAINER EVER,</i>

<i>AND TO MEET LOTS AND LOTS</i>
<i>OF GIRLS.</i>

<i>WELL, I DIDN'T SAY</i> ALL <i>THEIR</i>
<i>WISHES INVOLVED POKÃ©MON!</i>

<i>THE FUNNY THING ABOUT WISHES--</i>

<i>SOMETIMES THEY REALLY DO</i>
<i>COME TRUE.</i>

<i>AND THAT IS WHY YOU MUST BE</i>
<i>ESPECIALLY CAREFUL</i>

<i>FOR WHAT YOU WISH...</i>

<i>BECAUSE YOU JUST MIGHT GET IT.</i>

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

SO, WHERE'S THE MILLENNIUM
COMET ANYWAY?

IT WON'T APPEAR FOR ANOTHER
23 HOURS AND 42 MINUTES.

KNOW-IT-ALL!

UH, OH!

ARE WE GETTING CLOSE
TO WHERE THE FESTIVAL

IS SUPPOSED TO BE?

IT SHOULD BE IN THAT
VALLEY UP AHEAD.

WELL, THEN I WANT
TO GET THE FIRST LOOK.

LAST ONE THERE
IS A SLOWPOKE!

MAX, YOU'RE A SLOW-BRO!

VERY FUNNY, SIS.

<i>Brock: HEY, I DON'T WANT</i>
<i>TO BE THE SLOWPOKE!</i>

[BREATHING HARD]
PIKA!

[EVERYONE BREATHING HARD]


NOT MUCH OF A PARTY.

ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS IT?

THIS...IS THE SPOT.

WHERE IS EVERYONE?

WHAA! BOY,
I'M STARVING!

ME, TOO.

<i>ASH AND HIS FRIENDS</i>
<i>HAVE TAKEN A DETOUR</i>

<i>FROM THEIR POKÃ©MON JOURNEY TO</i>
<i>WITNESS WHAT FEW GET TO SEE--</i>

<i>THE MILLENNIUM COMET, WHICH</i>
<i>APPEARS FOR ONLY 7 NIGHTS</i>

<i>ONCE EVERY THOUSAND YEARS.</i>

<i>THEY HAD HOPED TO TAKE PART</i>
<i>IN THE MILLENNIUM FESTIVAL,</i>

<i>BUT THEIR TRUE ROLE IN</i>
<i>THE LEGEND OF THE COMET</i>

<i>WILL BE FAR GREATER THAN THEY</i>
<i>COULD HAVE EVER DREAMED.</i>


PI.

PIKA.

UNH...

HEY, COME BACK HERE!

May: WAIT UP!

EXCUSE ME.

HOW ABOUT WE SHARE A RIDE
THAT'S BUILT FOR TWO-OOO!

<i>James: THIS IS</i>
<i>THE BEST JOB EVER!</i>

WE JUST HAVE TO
THROW AROUND PAPER!

AND CLEAN MANURE,
WHATEVER THAT IS!

HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

HUH?!

<i>Ash: CHECK THIS OUT!</i>

SO, WHAT IS IT?

HEY, THAT'S THE MAGICIAN
WE SAW LAST NIGHT.

YOU'RE RIGHT!
PIKA!

<i>Ash: IF THAT'S HOW "THE GREAT</i>
<i>BUTLER" BUILDS HIS TENT,</i>

<i>THEN I CAN'T WAIT</i>
<i>TO SEE HIS SHOW!</i>

HAH!

HAH!


All: AHH!

WHOO-HOO!

WHOA! WHAT A TRICK!

All: AHH!

<i>Voice: WISH...THE STAR!</i>

HUH?

<i>FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO BE</i>
<i>THE GREATEST POKÃ©MON MASTER.</i>

<i>THAT</i> COULD <i>MAKE HIS WISH</i>
<i>COME TRUE.</i>
<i>FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO BE</i>
<i>THE GREATEST POKÃ©MON MASTER.</i>

MAKING BEAUTIFUL GIRLS APPEAR
MAGICALLY FROM THIN AIR--
<i>THAT</i> COULD <i>MAKE HIS WISH</i>
<i>COME TRUE.</i>
<i>FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO BE</i>
<i>THE GREATEST POKÃ©MON MASTER.</i>

<i>THAT</i> COULD <i>MAKE HIS WISH</i>
<i>COME TRUE.</i>
MAKING BEAUTIFUL GIRLS APPEAR
MAGICALLY FROM THIN AIR--

<i>COME TRUE.</i>

I'VE FINALLY FOUND
A CAREER FOR ME!
<i>THAT</i> COULD <i>MAKE HIS WISH</i>
<i>COME TRUE.</i>

I'VE FINALLY FOUND
A CAREER FOR ME!


YOU ARE TOO KIND!

FOR ME THE REAL MAGIC'S
WHEN I HEAR YOUR APPLAUSE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

I AM KNOWN AS
THE GREAT BUTLER!


AND THIS IS MY
ASSISTANT, DIANE.

I COULDN'T DO THE SHOW
WITHOUT MIGHTYENA!

RAHR!

<i>Butler: AND KIRLIA!</i>

KIRLIA!
RAHR!

<i>Voice: WISH MAKER...</i>
<i>THE COMET.</i>

HUH? THE COMET?

AWW.

UH...WHERE ARE YOU?

<i>Voice: I WISH YOU WERE</i>
<i>HERE...WITH ME!</i>

YOU'RE...IN THERE?

AAH!
UHH...HUH.

MAX!
OHH!

HMM?

HEY! YOU HAVE TO GET
BACK TO YOUR SEAT.

SORRY, BUT I THOUGHT
I HEARD A VOICE.

Both: HUH?

OH.
HMM.

Ash: MAX!

SORRY ABOUT
MY FRIEND.

MAX, WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU?

WAIT--

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

IT SEEMS WE HAVE
SOME VOLUNTEERS

TO HELP US WITH
OUR NEXT TRICK!

GENTLEMEN, YOU MUST
BE IN SHOW BUSINESS

BECAUSE YOUR TIMING
IS IMPECCABLE!

Both: HUH?

FELLOW MAGICIANS,
WHAT ARE YOUR NAMES?

MY NAME IS ASH.

I'M MAX--THE GREAT.

PIKACHU!

LET'S DO IT!

SINCE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
GREAT MAGICIANS,

FEAST YOUR EYES ON
BUTLER'S BURNING BOX!

YOU MUST SIMPLY
ESCAPE THE BOX

BEFORE IT BURSTS
INTO FLAMES!

BURNING BOX?
PIKA.

THAT'S YOUR CUE.

BUT, DIANE, WE'RE
NOT REALLY MAGICIANS.

YEAH, YEAH, SURE. AND
WE'RE NOT REALLY CLOWNS.

IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
THAT MAX AND ASH

GET TO BE IN THE
SHOW AND I DON'T!

YOU SAID IT!

IF THERE'S ANYONE
WHO SHOULD BE SHARING

THE SAME STAGE
AS DIANE, IT'S ME!

UHH...
OHH...

Butler: DUSCLOPS,
STEP FORWARD!

DUSCLOPS.

DUSCLOPS.

DUSCLOPS.

Butler: REAL MAGICIANS
LIKE ASH AND MAX

SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE
EASILY ESCAPING

FROM A BOX LIKE THIS.

SO, TO MAKE IT
INTERESTING,

THEY ONLY HAVE 10 SECONDS
'TIL DUSCLOPS DESTROYS IT

WITH HIS HYPERBEAM!

10...

OOH, THEY'RE STUCK
IN A DARK PLACE

<i>9.     </i> WITH IMPENDING DOOM
AND NO WAY OUT.

<i>8...   </i> THAT SOUNDS LIKE
MY LIFE.

HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET OUT?

I DON'T KNOW, ASH.
MUST BE SOME TRICK...

<i>5, 4...    </i> I HOPE OR THIS
COULD END BAD.

<i>3...       </i> DUS...

<i>2...               </i> OOH!

1!

DUSCLOPS, HYPERBEAM!

DUS!

All: OOHH!

OOHH!

<i>OOHH!...UNH!</i>

NOT ONLY DID THEY ESCAPE
FROM THE BOX JUST IN TIME,

BUT THEY MADE BOUQUETS
OF FLOWERS APPEAR AS WELL!

LET'S THANK THOSE
AMAZING MAGICIANS--

ASH, PIKACHU, AND
MAX THE GREAT!


HA HA! THANK YOU!
THANK YOU!

BRAVO!      BRAVO!

THANK YOU!

DO YOU THINK THEY'LL
TELL US HOW THEY DID IT?

DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL INTRODUCE ME

TO THAT GIRL DIANE?

AW! YEAH!

PIKACHU!
PIKA!

NOW THAT'S MAGIC!

PIKA...

CHU!

GIVE IT UP!
YOUR PIKA-POWER

WON'T WORK
IN OUR ZAP-TRAP.

AAH! AAH!

Both: AND NOW
ON WITH THE SHOW!

TEAM ROCKET, GIVE ME
BACK MY PIKACHU!

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

FOR OUR FINAL TRICK
OF THE EVENING,

WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ALL
THE POKÃ©MON DISAPPEAR!

THIS IS THE BEST
PART OF THE SHOW!

[ALL LAUGHING]

Meowth: SO WHO'S
THE CLOWNS NOW?!

YOU CAN KEEP
OUR SALARY.

WE'LL TAKE OUR PAY
IN POKÃ©MON!

NO!     NO!

STOP 'EM!

I'LL GET 'EM--
I'LL DO IT!

BEHOLD!

WE HAVE ONE FINAL
PERFORMANCE AS OUR ENCORE!

NOW DUSCLOPS...

CAPITATA!

DUS...CLOPS!

AAH!

PIKA!

PIKACHU!

PIKA!

HA! LET'S HAVE AN
ENCORE OF OUR OWN!

PIKA...CHU!

RAHR.

NO MAGIC SHOW WOULD BE COMPLETE
WITHOUT A VANISHING ACT,

AND SO WE SAVED
THE BEST FOR LAST.

DUSCLOPS,
USE NIGHT SHADE!

DUS...CLOPS!

LOOKS LIKE TEAM ROCKET'S
BLASTING OFF AGAIN.

BRAVO!      BRAVO!

EVERYONE THINKS
THAT TEAM ROCKET

WAS PART
OF THE SHOW.

YEAH. BUT THEY WON'T BE
BACK FOR A CURTAIN CALL.

[ASH AND MAX LAUGHING]

HA HA--


<i>Ash: JIRACHI?</i>

MM-HMM. ACCORDING
TO THE LEGEND,

JIRACHI IS A VERY SPECIAL
POKÃ©MON THAT AWAKENS

JUST ONCE EVERY
THOUSAND YEARS.

I THINK...IT'S SLEEPING
RIGHT INSIDE HERE.

Brock: IT'S
LIKE A COCOON.

AWESOME.
PIKA.

OH, THAT'S
AMAZING.

SO THE VOICE
THAT MAX HEARD--

YES. IT IS SAID THAT IN ORDER
TO AWAKEN FROM ITS SLUMBER,

JIRACHI NEEDS FOR
2 THINGS TO HAPPEN:

THE MILLENNIUM COMET MUST BE
VISIBLE IN THE NIGHT SKY,

AND JIRACHI MUST
FIND ITSELF...A FRIEND.

IT NEEDS A FRIEND?

IS THAT WHY IT WAS
TALKING TO MAX?

SO NOW WE JUST NEED
THE MILLENNIUM COMET.

HMM, AND THAT'S
TONIGHT.

AWW!

HELLO...JIRACHI.

FIRST, MAX WAS
HEARING THINGS,

AND NOW HE'S MADE FRIENDS
WITH A BIG ROCK.

CUT IT OUT!

YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
THAT JIRACHI CHOSE ME

TO TALK TO AS HIS
FRIEND INSTEAD OF YOU!

THEY ALSO SAY JIRACHI HAS
THE POWER TO GRANT WISHES,

BUT IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING

WITHOUT FIRST HAVING YOU
AS ITS FRIEND.

OH, OK, I'LL DO IT.

MAX, MEET JIRACHI.

HOW DO YOU DO?

AWW...              PIKA.

WOW. MAX, CAN I SEE
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE?

LET ME SEE!

I THOUGHT IT'S CRAZY TO
BE FRIENDS WITH A ROCK!

YEAH, WELL,
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

PLEASE, LET ME
JUST HOLD IT.

NO WAY!

HEY, GET BACK HERE!

<i>Max: I CAN'T HEAR YOU!</i>

<i>May: I SAID I WAS SORRY!</i>

HMM.            HMM.

[RIDERS SCREAMING]

May: WOW, LOOK AT THIS!

YOU HAVE EXCELLENT TASTE,
YOUNG LADY.

THAT'S A WISHING STAR.

A WISHING STAR?

IT WORKS WITH
THE MILLENNIUM COMET.

ON EACH OF THE 7 NIGHTS
THAT THE COMET APPEARS,

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
FOLD DOWN ONE OF THE SECTIONS

AND MAKE A WISH.

All: OHH.

IF YOU DO IT
ALL 7 NIGHTS,

THEN YOUR WISH
WILL COME TRUE.

WOW! I'LL TAKE IT!

A WISE CHOICE.

BUT YOU ONLY GET ONE WISH,
SO MAKE IT COUNT.

UHH.

WHOA. WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT!

WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
THE COMET APPEARS.

CAN YOU SEE THAT, JIRACHI?

FIREWORKS!

IT'S GETTING CLOUDY.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
SEE THE COMET TONIGHT.

NO FAIR.

OH. YOU AND I ARE GONNA
BE BEST FRIENDS, JIRACHI.

MMM.

HA HA.
PIKACHU.

AHH.

PIKA.
AHH.

AHH...

AHH.

<i>Brock: THE MILLENNIUM</i>
<i>COMET--</i>

<i>RIGHT ON SCHEDULE!</i>

AHH...
PIKA.

OH, I'D BETTER
MAKE MY WISH.

ONCE EVERY THOUSAND YEARS.

WE'RE SO LUCKY.

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
PEOPLE LOOKED UP IN THE SKY

AND SAW
THE MILLENNIUM COMET.

<i>I WONDER HOW DIFFERENT</i>
<i>OUR WORLD LOOKS</i>

<i>FROM UP THERE. A LOT</i>
<i>OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED</i>

<i>IN A THOUSAND YEARS.</i>

AND A LOT HASN'T.

OH...HUH?

OHH...

GOOD NIGHT, MAX.

OHH...MOMMY.

HMM.


HMM.

THAT'S A LULLABY
OUR MOTHER ALWAYS SANG.


[SNORING LIGHTLY]

[HUMMING CONTINUES]


Pikachu: PIKA.

<i>Jirachi, thinking:</i>
<i>THE STAR--</i>

<i>THE STAR IS CALLING.</i>

[ALL GASP]

YOU HEAR THAT?

WAS THAT JIRACHI'S VOICE?

IT'S TELEPATHY.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

ABSOL.

OHH.

[ALL GASP]

[ALL GASP]

[ALL GASP]

PIKA.


HEH.

UHH. UHH...

JIRACHI.

IT'S TRUE.

PIKA PIKA.

IT'S REALLY
KIND OF CUTE.

HI. I'M MAX.

HELLO, MAX.

I'M ASH,
AND THIS IS PIKACHU.

AND MY NAME'S MAY.

I'M BROCK.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

PIKACHU.

HELLO, ASH, PIKACHU,

MAY, BROCK.


DIANE, IT'S JIRACHI.
IT WOKE UP.

I'LL GO TELL BUTLER
THE GOOD NEWS.

MEANWHILE, YOU GUYS
CAN CAMP OUT

IN OUR BUS TONIGHT.

Brock: THANKS.

IT WAS TRUE.

I KNEW IT!

JIRACHI WILL BE THE STAR
OF OUR GREATEST SHOW!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

I'VE WAITED FOREVER
FOR THIS DAY.

HMM.

<i>Max: HEY, JIRACHI,</i>

<i>CAN YOU REALLY</i>
<i>GRANT WISHES?</i>

WISHES?

LET'S TEST IT OUT.

I GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO WISH FOR.

DO YOU THINK
I CAN TRY, TOO?

LET ME MAKE A WISH.

HEY, I WAS FIRST!

HMM. CANDY--I WISH
FOR LOTS OF CANDY.

THAT'S
A DUMB WISH.

NO, IT'S NOT.

CANDY?

HMM.

[CHIMES TINKLING]
HMM...

SO, WHERE'S
THE CANDY?

May:
IT DIDN'T WORK.

YEAH, I DON'T SEE
ANY CANDY ANYWHERE. HMM.

THERE'S
NO SUCH THING

AS SOMEONE BEING ABLE
TO GRANT YOUR WISHES.

I KNEW IT.

THEN HOW COME YOUR MOUTH
WAS WATERING?

UH...

Ash:
HEY, LOOK.

HUH? OHH.
HUH? OHH.

CANDY!

CANDY!
CANDY! CANDY!

CANDY!
PIKA!

May:
HIS WISH...

IT CAME TRUE.

WAY TO GO,
JIRACHI.

Jirachi: CANDY, CANDY!


WHAT'S HAPPENING?

WHOA. JIRACHI,
THANKS FOR ALL THE CANDY.

CANDY, CANDY!

HEY, JIRACHI, HOW ABOUT YOU
GRANT MY WISH NEXT?

WAIT, JIRACHI.
IT'S MY TURN.

I WISH FOR LOTS OF GIRLS.

YOU'RE AFTER ME,
BROCK.

AND YOU'RE BOTH
AFTER ME.

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

All: WHOA!

HUH?

[BOTH GROANING]

PIKA.
UHH!

WHERE'S
JIRACHI?

JIRACHI'S RIGHT HERE.

RIGHT HERE! RIGHT HERE!

UHH.

WHAT HAPPENED?

I WISHED THAT I HAD
LOTS AND LOTS OF CANDY,

AND THEN JIRACHI
GRANTED MY WISH FOR ME.

THOSE ARE FROM
THE SNACK BAR IN THE PARK.

THAT'S BECAUSE JIRACHI
HAS THE POWER

TO TELEPORT THINGS.

HUH?
HUH?

THEN THE CANDY
IS ALL--YAAH!

FREE AT LAST.

PIKA.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

I'M RUINED, I TELL YOU!
I'M RUINED!


I KNEW SOMETHING
WAS FUNNY.

MAX, THIS IS
ALL YOUR FAULT

WITH YOUR STUPID WISH.

Max: SO WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

JIRACHI CAN PUT THE CANDY
BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM.

THAT'S IT.

JIRACHI, GET RID
OF THE PROBLEM.

GET RID OF PROBLEM?

OK.

HUH?

Brock: AAH!
SHE'S GONE!

DISAPPEARED!
PIKA!

JIRACHI, WHAT DID YOU
DO WITH MY SISTER?

<i>May: HELP! HELP ME!</i>

SOMEONE GET ME
OUT OF HERE!

IN THERE.

[BROCK AND ASH GRUNT]

Jirachi, thinking:
SLEEPY.

GETTING VERY SLEEPY.

UHH.

JIRACHI.

IS THAT ALL
HE STAYS AWAKE?

HE'S JUST RECHARGING
HIS ENERGY.

JIRACHI WON'T
HIBERNATE AGAIN

UNTIL THE COMET IS GONE
NEXT WEEK.

AH.
THANK GOODNESS.

<i>May: THAT WASN'T</i>
<i>VERY FUNNY.</i>

NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO WITH ALL THIS CANDY?

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CARRY IT

BACK THERE OURSELVES.

WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

PIKA.


BOY.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

MMM.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

UHH.

AHH.

GOOD MORNING, JIRACHI.

HOW'D YOU SLEEP?


ARE YOU OK?

MAX.

YEP. THAT'S ME.

WISH MAKER.

[BOTH LAUGH]

HA HA HA! TA-DA!

WHAT DO YOU THINK,
PIKACHU?

PIKA PIKA!

YOU BOTH LOOK GREAT.

AND YOU LOOK GREAT
YOURSELF, DIANE.

HEY, GUYS. I'M GOING
TO PLAY WITH JIRACHI.

DON'T GO TOO FAR.

AND COME BACK BEFORE
THE SHOW STARTS.

DON'T WORRY.

Jirachi:
DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY.

MAX IS SURE
IN A GREAT MOOD.

HE AND JIRACHI
ARE ALREADY BEST FRIENDS.

LIKE BROTHERS.

MMM.

HA HA! AAH!
AAH!

AAH!

[BOTH LAUGHING]

AH.
OH.

MMM.
MMM.

[BOTH LAUGH]

AH.
AH.

<i>Jessie:</i>
<i>JIRACHI?</i>

HEY, THAT'S THE POKÃ©MON

THEY SAY
CAN GRANT WISHES.

AND IT CAN TELEPORT
STUFF, TOO.

THEN OUR FIRST WISH
SHOULD BE

THAT IT DOESN'T TELEPORT
ITSELF AWAY FROM US

ONCE WE CAPTURE IT.

COULD YOU HAVE
SAID SOMETHING

EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS
THAN THAT?

WHAT IF JIRACHI GRANTS
US JUST ONE WISH ONLY?

YOU'D WASTE IT ON THAT?

I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT.

YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

WE MIGHT ONLY GET
ONE WISH, AND THAT'S IT.

WE'RE GOING TO NEED
THE PERFECT WISH.

<i>Jessie: I'VE GOT IT.</i>

<i>WHY DON'T WE JUST WISH</i>
<i>FOR A HUNDRED MORE WISHES?</i>

<i>IT'S GENIUS.</i>

<i>James:</i>
<i>BUT, JESSIE,</i>

<i>WHAT IF JIRACHI</i>
<i>TELEPORTS AWAY FROM US</i>

<i>AFTER THE FIRST WISH?</i>

<i>Meowth: I WISH</i>
<i>I COULD TELEPORT AWAY</i>

<i>FROM THE TWO OF YOUSE.</i>

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

ABSOL.

<i>Ash: HOPE YOU</i>
<i>ENJOYED THE SHOW.</i>

<i>Brock:</i>
<i>THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</i>


AAH!

UNH! HELP ME, MAX!

OK.


GO PLAY SOME MORE.

JUST A SECOND!

BET YOU CAN'T
CATCH ME.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

WAIT!
AAH!

<i>Jirachi:</i>
<i>YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!</i>

YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!

GIVE IT BACK!

GIVE ME MY GLASSES!

COME BACK HERE!
I'M GOING TO GET YOU!

<i>Jirachi:</i>
<i>YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!</i>

MAY, WHAT HAPPENED?

JIRACHI HAPPENED.

PIKA.
UHH!

HA HA! HERE I AM.

JIRACHI SAID ABSOL
CAME FOR HIM.

IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER?

UNLIKELY, SINCE
JIRACHI'S BEEN ASLEEP

FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

WHAT CAN YOU
TELL US?

I AM SO SLEEPY.


[BOTH SNORING LIGHTLY]


WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT,
I ALMOST FORGOT.

IT'S NIGHT 2 OF THE COMET.

MILLENNIUM COMET,

WON'T YOU PLEASE
MAKE MY WISH COME TRUE?

[DOOR OPENS]
HUH?

WHAT'S BUTLER'S DOING?

<i>Diane:</i>
<i>I THINK ABSOL'S HERE</i>

<i>TO TAKE JIRACHI</i>
<i>BACK TO FORINA.</i>

PROBABLY.

<i>HE BELONGS THERE.</i>

<i>WE SHOULD'VE NEVER</i>
<i>TAKEN HIM AWAY.</i>

I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

BUTLER,
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

I HAVE
A SINKING FEELING

THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE
IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

I'VE WORKED SO HARD AND
WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS DAY.

NOW IT'S SHOWTIME.


WHEN YOU SEE THE COMET
WITH YOUR TRUE EYE,

YOU WILL ABSORB
ITS TREMENDOUS ENERGY

AND HELP MAKE MY OWN WISH
FINALLY COME TRUE.

UHH! UHH! UHH...

ESTEEMED COUNCIL
OF TEAM MAGMA,

OBSERVE THIS FOSSILIZED
REMNANT OF GROUDON.

I HAVE INVENTED A DEVICE

THAT WILL GENERATE
A LIVING, BREATHING GROUDON

RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW,
FROM THIS ONE SMALL PIECE.

I GIVE YOU...
A GROUDON!

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

[ENERGY SURGING]

UHH!

AAH!

UHH!



HUH? UHH.

<i>Magma boss: SO, THAT'S</i>
<i>A LIVING, BREATHING GROUDON?</i>

<i>I MUST SAY, IT'S NOT QUITE</i>
<i>AS BIG AS I HAD IMAGINED.</i>

I NEED A MORE POWERFUL
ENERGY SOURCE

TO SPARK
THE REGENERATION PROCESS.

<i>ENOUGH OF</i>
<i>YOUR MUMBO JUMBO.</i>



<i>WE'LL FIND GROUDON</i>
<i>OURSELVES.</i>

<i>YOU'RE NO LONGER WELCOME</i>
<i>AT TEAM MAGMA.</i>

THAT'S JUST FINE.
UHH.


THIS ISN'T THE LAST
YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME.

TEAM MAGMA MADE
A MOCKERY OF MY WORK,

BUT FINALLY,
I'LL SHOW THEM.

[JIRACHI MOANING]

BUTLER...

NOW, JIRACHI, GET ME
THE ENERGY THAT I NEED.

OPEN YOUR TRUE EYE
AND ABSORB THE COMET'S POWER.

I DON'T WANT TO.

I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

DUSCLOPS, PSYCHIC.

DUSCLOPS.


WHOA!

TO HARNESS IT.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO JIRACHI?

I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

NO WAY!

BUTLER, IT'S NOT
TOO LATE TO STOP.

WHY WOULD I STOP NOW THAT
I'VE GOTTEN SO CLOSE?

JUST HAVE FAITH
IN ME, DIANE.

AB!
AAH!

Jirachi, thinking:
I WISH I WAS HOME.

I WISH I COULD GO
TO FORINA.

UH, WHERE'S FORINA?

MAX, HURRY!

EVERYONE, FOLLOW ME!

OK.
CHU!

DUSCLOPS,
AFTER THEM!

DUS!

SOL!

AB...SOL!

UHH!
OHH!

AB...

SOL. AB.

UHH.
GO, MIGHTYENA!

[SNAP, ENERGY SURGES]

GRR! YENA!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

<i>James:</i>
<i>THAT'S BUTLER'S BUS.</i>

YEAH, BUT THAT MAGICIAN
AIN'T INSIDE.

BUT JIRACHI IS.

VERY INTERESTING.

WOBBUFFET!

OH!
MMM.


YENA!


[MUSIC ENDS]

<i>Diane:</i>
<i>JIRACHI SAID</i>

<i>IT WANTED TO GO</i>
<i>BACK TO FORINA?</i>

MM-HMM.

HE WANTS TO GO HOME--

BACK TO WHERE BUTLER
FOUND HIM.

NOW THAT I HAVE THIS,

WE CAN FINALLY HAVE
THE LAST LAUGH ON TEAM MAGMA.


<i>Diane: BUTLER</i>
<i>WAS ONCE A SCIENTIST</i>

<i>FOR TEAM MAGMA.</i>

HE WAS WORKING
ON THE GROUDON PROJECT.

<i>May: GROUDON?</i>

ISN'T THAT
THE LEGENDARY POKÃ©MON

RUMORED TO HAVE
INCREDIBLE POWERS?

YES. AND TEAM MAGMA
WILL STOP AT NOTHING

TO GET THEIR HANDS
ON GROUDON.

BUTLER TRIED
TO MAKE THEM A GROUDON,

BUT HIS EXPERIMENT
FAILED.

I DON'T GET WHAT JIRACHI
HAS TO DO WITH ALL THIS.

WELL, IN ORDER TO POWER
HIS MACHINE,

BUTLER NEEDED
AN ENERGY SOURCE

THAT'S AVAILABLE ONCE
EVERY THOUSAND YEARS.

EVERY
THOUSAND YEARS?

PI?
OHH.

<i>May:</i>
<i>THE MILLENNIUM COMET.</i>

<i>Diane: JIRACHI CAN ABSORB</i>
<i>THE COMET'S POWER.</i>

BUTLER WOULD USE
THIS ENERGY

TO MAKE A GROUDON

BY DRAINING ALL
OF THE COMET'S POWER

FROM JIRACHI'S BODY.

SOUNDS LIKE THAT COULD
REALLY HURT JIRACHI.

YES.

UH...

WHY IS BUTLER DOING THIS?

<i>Diane:</i>
<i>HE WANTS REVENGE</i>

<i>AGAINST TEAM MAGMA.</i>

WELL, LET HIM GET REVENGE
SOME OTHER WAY.

WE CAN'T LET HIM HURT
JIRACHI.

SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE
BEST FRIEND, MAX.

PIKA.

Brock:
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

JIRACHI SAID IT.
TAKE HIM TO FORINA.

<i>RIGHT, DIANE?</i>

LET'S GO.
AH.


[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]


DIANE, I THOUGHT
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE

WOULD UNDERSTAND
MY FEELINGS.

HUHH. IT'S TIME.

[MUSIC ENDS]


[ALL GROANING]

PIKA!



[BEEPING STOPS]

NIGHT 3.

HMM.

HMM.

<i>Pikachu: PI.</i>

[SNORING LIGHTLY]

PI.

PI.

<i>MMM.</i>
<i> UHH.</i>

HUH?

SO, WHAT'S
EVERYONE DOING?

WELL, ASH, MAX, AND JIRACHI
HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP.

[TURNS ON WATER]

BUTLER AND I HAVE KNOWN
EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

I KNEW EVEN THEN THAT
WE'D ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

<i>HE ALWAYS HAD A WAY</i>
<i>OF MAKING ME SMILE.</i>

<i>Butler: AND NOW</i>
<i>FOR MY GREATEST TRICK.</i>

UNH.

1, 2, 3!

AH!

PLEASE,
HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE...

UNTIL YOU SEE
THE BUTTERFREE!

[CLAPS HANDS] OH! THAT WAS
REALLY GREAT, BUTLER.

HEY, I LIKE THAT--
THE GREAT BUTLER.


[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS
HAD LOTS OF FUN.

IT'S BEEN
A VERY LONG TIME

SINCE I'VE SEEN BUTLER
LAUGH LIKE THAT. MM.

[SNORING LIGHTLY]

I JUST HOPE THAT
ONCE THE COMET LEAVES,

THE REAL BUTLER
COMES BACK,

AND WE CAN GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

[SNORING LIGHTLY]

[MUSIC ENDS]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

All: UHH!

UHH!

[ALL SLURPING]


All: UHH!

UHH. YEAH!

[ALL LAUGH]

Ash: IT'S ALL
IN THE WRIST, MAX.

Max:
HERE GOES. UNH!

YEAH! I DID IT!

YAY! YAY!

[ALL LAUGH]


HUH?
HUH?


OHH.

[MUSIC ENDS]

JUST 2 NIGHTS LEFT.

<i>Max:</i>
<i>CUT IT OUT, MAY!</i>

HUH?

UNH! QUIT COUNTING
ALREADY.

SORRY.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

HUH?

WHAT'S WRONG?

PIKA.

I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS
LEFT WITH JIRACHI.

JIRACHI'S GOING TO BE
WITH YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

NOT JUST
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE, ASH.

YOU SEE, SOMETIMES
FRIENDS HAVE TO GO AWAY,

BUT A PART OF THEM
STAYS BEHIND WITH YOU.

IT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE
WHEN THE FRIENDS

ARE BEST,
<i>BEST</i> FRIENDS.

YOU'LL REMEMBER
JIRACHI FOREVER,

AND HE'S GONNA ALWAYS
BE IN YOUR HEART.

A GOOD FRIEND LEFT ME,
AND...

I MISS HER EVERY DAY.

BUT I...

I KNOW WE'LL ALWAYS
BE FRIENDS FOREVER.

PIKACHU!

MM.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

THERE'S FORINA.

IT'S AWESOME.

JIRACHI'S HOME.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


[ALL GASP]



NUZLEAF.

DO YOU LIKE IT?

WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

I LOVE IT.

PIKA!

UHH! HA!

UHH! I'M STRONGER
THAN YOU, MAX!

STRONGER
THAN MAX!

[BOTH GRUNTING]

[BOTH LAUGH]

MAX, IT'S TIME
TO GO TO SLEEP.

I WANT TO STAY UP
A LITTLE LONGER.

YOU HAVE A BIG DAY
AHEAD TOMORROW,

AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE TIRED FOR IT,

DO YOU?

AW, I HATE IT

WHEN YOU MAKE
MORE SENSE THAN ME.


BUT I DOUBT
I CAN SLEEP

KNOWING IT'S MY LAST NIGHT
WITH JIRACHI.

I GOT IT.
ONCE THEY FALL ASLEEP,

WE'LL GET UP AND PLAY.

GOOD IDEA.

MM.


[BREATHES IN]

[SINGING LULLABY]

PI...

[SINGING FADES]

[ALL GASP]

BACK HOME.

YEAH.

OHH.

OHH.

OHH.

THE SPOT WHERE JIRACHI
SLEPT FOR 1,000 YEARS

IS JUST AHEAD.

AB...

SOL!

[ALL GASP]

Jirachi: THE STAR...
IT CALLS ME.

HUH?

JIRACHI!

I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO!

I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN
REALLY GRANT WISHES,

BUT IF YOU CAN,

THEN I HAVE A BIG ONE
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

I WISH YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO

SO WE CAN STAY
TOGETHER FOREVER!

PIKA.

MAX, THE STAR...

I MUST.

OH.

JIRACHI
IS GETTING READY.

READY FOR WHAT?

<i>Diane: JIRACHI WILL OPEN</i>
<i>HIS TRUE EYE</i>

<i>AND USE IT TO ABSORB ENERGY</i>
<i>FROM THE MILLENNIUM COMET.</i>

WHAT DOES IT DO
WITH THE ENERGY?

WHERE'S IT GO?

Diane: THEY SAY THAT
DURING THE 1,000 YEARS

THAT JIRACHI SLEEPS,

ALL THE ENERGY
HE ABSORBED FROM THE COMET

IS SLOWLY RELEASED
INTO THE EARTH.

<i>EVERYTHING THAT GROWS</i>
<i>IN FORINA</i>

<i>FEEDS OFF THAT ENERGY.</i>

SO, THEN JIRACHI
HELPED MAKE ALL THIS?

WOW.


JIRACHI!

[ALL GASP]

WHAT'S
HAPPENING?

IT'S A TRAP.

[BOTH GASP]

SHOWTIME!

AND, LIKE EVERY
GREAT MAGICIAN,

I SAVED MY BEST TRICK
FOR LAST!

BUTLER.

LET JIRACHI GO!

FOR THEIR FINALE,
MOST MAGICIANS

WOULD PROBABLY
END THEIR SHOW

WITH SOMETHING
VERY OBVIOUS,

LIKE MAKING
A POKÃ©MON DISAPPEAR.

BUT, SINCE I'M NOT
LIKE MOST MAGICIANS,

FOR TONIGHT'S SHOW,

I'LL BE MAKING
A POKÃ©MON <i>REAPPEAR!</i>

YOU'RE MAD!

NOT MAD.
JUST A LITTLE ANGRY

AND MAYBE
A WEE BIT IMPATIENT

TO GET ON
WITH THE SHOW.


LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BOYS AND GIRLS,

IT'S THE MOMENT
YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!

JIRACHI!
UHH!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

SO, JIRACHI,

LET'S DO THIS
JUST LIKE WE REHEARSED IT.


SEE THAT?

DO YOU THINK
I'M BLIND?

THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE HAIR.



[MACHINES WHIRRING]

NOW TEAM MAGMA WILL LEARN
TO NEVER HAVE DOUBTED ME!

<i>PIKA...CHUUUU!</i>

IT'S NO GOOD.

PIKA PIKA!

ALL RIGHT.
BUT JUST HANG ON

AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN.

PIKACHU!

TIME TO SAVE JIRACHI.


YEAH!

CAREFUL.

[BOTH GRUNT]

[ALL GASP]

JUST SECONDS FROM NOW,

GROUDON WILL RETURN TO LIFE
AND PROVE THAT I WAS RIGHT!

[FLYGON SQUAWKS]
OHH!

JIRACHI!

UHH!




<i>Butler: SALAMANCE,</i>
<i>GET RID OF THEM!</i>



SALAMANCE!


HUNH!

FLYGON, WATCH OUT.

HE'S CLOSING
HIS TRUE EYE.

UHH...

JIRACHI!

PIKA!

YOU'RE OK!

[BOTH GRUNT]

THANK YOU,
FLYGON.


<i>May: MAX!</i>

Brock: ASH!

JIRACHI?

HE'S OK.

SAME WITH YOU?

YEAH.

WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

I'M OK.


HMM.





IT CAN'T BE.

WHAT'S THAT?

THAT'S GROUDON?

[METAL SCREECHING]



[TREES CRACKING]


UHH. THAT CREATURE'S
NOT GROUDON.

THE TREES
ARE ALL DYING!

THE EARTH...

IT'S SUCKING ENERGY

HUH?

LINOONE! LINOONE!

CHYENA!


ELECTRIKE!




[ALL GASP]


BUTLER,
PLEASE TELL ME

YOU HAVE A PLAN
TO STOP THIS!

NO. I DON'T.

I HAVE NOTHING
UP MY SLEEVE.

NO TRICKS LEFT.

MAYBE NOW'S NOT
A GOOD TIME...

FOR US TO DROP IN
UNEXPECTED.

Meowth: YEAH.

[ALTARIA CHATTERING]

[ALL SCREAMING]

SOL...

ABSOL.

[ALL CHATTERING]

IT'S SUCKING UP

All: BRELOOM!
BRELOOM! BRELOOM!

All: NUZLEAF!
NUZLEAF! NUZLEAF!

THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN.

THAT'S NOT GROUDON.

IT'S EVIL.
IT'S PURE EVIL.


[BOTH GRUNT]

AAH!
DIANE!



OHH! MY DARLING,

IF THIS IS THE END,

THEN I'M GLAD THE LAST
THING I SEE IS YOU.

UHH!


DIANE!

IT'S TOO FAST!
IT'S CATCHING UP!

<i>PIKA!</i>

[JIRACHI GRUNTS]




LISTEN TO ME.
I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP.

WE HAVE TO STOP
THIS CREATURE,

AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO DO IT.

YEA, WHAT?

JIRACHI SHOULD BE ABLE

TO ABSORB ENERGY
OUT OF THAT MONSTER

IF WE PUT HIM BACK
ON MY MACHINE.

<i>WE JUST HAVE</i>
<i>TO REVERSE THE POLARITY</i>

<i>AND IT SHOULD WORK.</i>

I'M NOT SURE I TRUST
ANY PLAN OF YOURS.

YOU'VE GOT TO!

UHH! I JUST WANT
TO SAVE DIANE.

UHH...

PIKA!
[ALL GASP]

AAH!


UHH! AAAH!

BUTLER!
AAH!



AAAAAH!

YOU SAVED HIM.

BUTLER CAN'T BE
ALL BAD.

UH...

HE LOVES DIANE.

UH.

MM-HMM.

[BOTH SCREAMING]


Butler: THE MONSTER
WILL KEEP CHASING JIRACHI.

KEEP IT DISTRACTED

AND I'LL SET
EVERYTHING UP.

Ash: YOU GOT IT.

YOU READY?
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SAVE
MAY, BROCK AND DIANE.

MM!
PIKA PIKA!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]


LET'S GO!


YEAH, OUR PLAN'S
WORKING.


UHH!

ONCE I REVERSE THIS,
IT SHOULD BE READY TO GO.


AAH! NO!

NOW PLACE
JIRACHI THERE.

OK.

JIRACHI,
ARE YOU READY?

ALL COME TRUE.

HE'S RIGHT.
YOU MADE

HIS WISHES
COME TRUE.

YEAH.
YEAH.

PIKA.

NOW, MAX,

WILL YOU GRANT ME
ONE FINAL WISH?

ONE FINAL WISH?

I'M FEELING SO SLEEPY.

I WISH YOU'D SING
THAT SONG FOR ME.

JIRACHI...

THE SONG.

HE WANTS
THE LULLABY.

WE CAN ALL
GRANT YOUR WISH.

THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY.

GOOD NIGHT,

I HOPE YOU HAVE
SWEET DREAMS.

PIKACHU.

AHH.

UH...JIRACHI...

MY HEART...

THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL BE.

MMM.

IS THIS AN ILLUSION
OR AM I JUST SEEING THINGS?

THIS ALL COULD'VE BEEN
JUST ANOTHER TRICK

BY THAT MAGICIAN.

MAYBE, BUT I FEEL
LIKE I GOT MY WISH.

I'LL TELL YOU MINE
IF YOU TELL ME YOURS.

MEOWTH, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD GO FIRST.

WHY DON'T WE ALL SAY OURS
AT THE SAME TIME?

All: IF I COULD ONLY HAVE
ONE WISH,

IT WOULD BE
TO ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THIS.

DIANE AND I WILL BE
STAYING IN FORINA.

WE BOTH FINALLY
REALIZED

WHAT'S
MOST IMPORTANT,

AND THAT'S
TO BE TOGETHER.

I'M SO HAPPY
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

<i>YOU GOT</i>
<i>YOUR WISH, DIANE.</i>

YEAH.

HOW ABOUT WE GIVE YOU GUYS
A RIDE BACK TO TOWN?

SO JUST WHAT WAS
DIANE'S WISH?

WELL, I CAN'T TELL.
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.

THAT WOULD BE
A FIRST.

HEY, WAIT.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR
MILLENNIUM COMET WISH?

OHH!

OHH.

I FORGOT TO WISH
THE LAST NIGHT.

IT DOESN'T MATTER.

WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE OUR OWN
DREAMS COME TRUE ANYWAY.

YEAH, WISHING WOULD TAKE
ALL THE FUN OUT OF IT.

PIKACHU!

<i>Jirachi, echoing:</i>
<i>MAX!</i>

<i>I'LL NEVER</i>
