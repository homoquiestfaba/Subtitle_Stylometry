Yo, yo, yo!

Shh! I just put the kids to bed.

Gunter, it's so great you
offered to do this, buddy.

I insist to Rosita.

I'm known as, like, the
very best babysitter.

Are you sure you're
okay with this?

This will be as easy
as dÃ¼sselberry pie.

I will prove to you, okay?
Trust Gunter.

I'm having second thoughts.

Go, go, it will be,
like, totally fine.


Shh...

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

I forgot to say we'll
be home by 9:00.

If there's any problem
at all, just call me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Goodbye now.


Hello, tiny piglet.

Mommy will be back soon.

Uncle Gunter is here
in the meantime,

so go back to sleep.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

Can I have some candy?

No, no, no. You must go
back to sleeping, okay?

Pretty please?

Hmm. Okay, okay.

I give you one piece,
and then the bedtime.

Oh, no! (GASPS)

Okay, all right...

ALL: Candy!

Don't, please!



Don't! Now is the time
for the sleeping.

(PIGLETS LAUGHING)

Please, piggies, beddy-bye time.



(PIGLETS CLAMORING)

My tongue is warm.

Mmm...

He's gonna call Mommy!

I didn't want to
have to do this.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

(ALL GASP)

Okay.

Now, follow along
with Uncle Gunter.

We dance all your
energies out now!

Follow the piggy piper.

Try as you might, you can't
deny the power of the beat.

(ALL SIGHING)

Yeah!

Bedtime.

But I'm not tired.

Hurry!


Oh! Here we go.



Wow. Gunter, I have to
admit I'm impressed.

Yeah. I told you, it's
easy as dÃ¼sselberry pie.



Same time next week?
