SARA MCANDREWS,

THIS IS DEPUTY SANDERS CALLING

FROM THE COUNTY SHERRIFF'S
OFFICE.

I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

MY APOLOGIES FOR CALLING
SO LATE.

IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE DAYS,
AND WE'RE SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED.

SO REGARDING THIS TRESPASSER

YOU SAW ON YOUR PROPERTY
THIS MORNING,

REST ASSURED,
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

IT'S PROBABLY JUST A DRIFTER
PASSING THROUGH.

IN ANY CASE,
I'LL DROP BY TOMORROW,

MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT, AND...

WELL, I'LL HAVE ONE
OF THOSE DELICIOUS BROWNIES

THAT EVERYONE'S
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

WE'RE HERE FOR YOUR SAFETY,
OKAY?

HOPE YOU FOLKS HAVE
A GREAT NIGHT.

HEY, HONEY.
WHAT?

YOU KNOW, NEXT TIME WE GO OUT,

WOULD YOU MIND JUST LEAVING
ONE LIGHT ON?

NO, IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK
LIKE WE'RE HOME.

YEAH, BUT, LIKE, WE DIDN'T
MOVE IN TO A LIGHTHOUSE.

YEAH, YOU'RE FUNNY.
SUCH A JOKESTER.

AM I?
YEAH.

I'M NOT AS FUNNY
AS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL

THAT DANCE THING THING
YOU MADE ME SIT THROUGH.

WHAT WAS THAT?
IT WAS AWFUL.

OH, COME ON.

IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

IT WAS HORRIBLE.
WHAT?

ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS DIFFICULT?

NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL, AND...

[sighs]

YOU ARE A PHILISTINE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

IT INVOLVES A LOT MORE SKILL
THAN ONE OF YOUR FOOTBALL GAMES.

AS IN, A GAGGLE
OF HAIRLESS MEN

RUNNING AROUND,
ROLLING ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER,

ON A LARGE STEEL TABLE--

YEAH, EXACTLY.

NAKED, HAIRLESS MEN?

NO, MEN TAKEN OVER
BY THE SPIRIT OF DANCE.

AND THEY WEREN'T ALL HAIRLESS.
UGH, PLEASE.

NOW I CAN'T EAT
IN THE CAFETERIA ANYMORE.

WHY?

BECAUSE THEY JUST INSTALLED

THE EXACT SAME KIND OF TABLE.

OH, NO.

I'M GONNA BE OBSESSING

OVER EVERY LITTLE STAIN
ON THE THING.

WELL, MAYBE
IN BETWEEN MEETINGS,

YOU AND TONY CAN TRY IT OUT.

[laughs]

YOU TWO WOULD MAKE
A TERRIFIC DUO.

OH, GOD.
[laughs]

I'D DEFINITELY PAY
TO SEE THAT.

YOU GUYS WOULD PROBABLY DRAW
QUITE THE CROWD

IF WE DIDN'T LIVE
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

SWEETHEART, YOU KNOW...

OUR SON'S GONNA THANK YOU
FOR IT LATER.

HE'LL TELL YOU
IN HIS DEEP, MANLY VOICE--

HE'LL SAY, "THANKS, MA.

"THANKS FOR FOLLOWING PA
TO THE COUNTRYSIDE.

"I'M A LUCKY BOY, YOU KNOW?

"I CAN SEE THAT NOW.

I LEARNED
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO"--

LIVE LIKE A PEASANT.

[laughs]

"TO BREATH THE FRESH AIR,

"YOU KNOW, TO RIDE MY BIKE
IN THE FOREST,

"TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE
MY FOOTBALL SKILLS

"IN MY HUGE BACKYARD
WITHOUT BEING BOTHERED

BY THE RIFFRAFF FROM YOUR OLD
DISGUSTING NEIGHBORHOOD."

MM.
HEY.

NOTHING BEATS A REAL HOME.

NOW, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT,
CITY GIRL?

MM.
HMM?

I SAY THAT I NEED

A GLASS OF MILK.

ALL RIGHT.

[gasps]
WHOOPS.

HONEY, COULD YOU PLEASE CHECK
THE MESSAGES?

[answering machine beeps]

TWO NEW MESSAGES.

HI, SWEETIE.

HOPE YOUR DATE NIGHT WENT WELL.

WE HAD A FUN NIGHT.

OH, ADAM LOVES WATCHING
ALL THE CARS

PASSING BY THE CONDO.

LISTEN, I CALLED
MY DOCTOR FRIEND--

SURE YOU DID.

AND SHE'S NOT SURE IF ADAM'S
GETTING ENOUGH PROTEIN.

HE LOOKS VERY PALE.

AND HARDLY ANY BABY FAT.

OH, BY THE WAY,
I TRIED CALLING YOUR CELL,

BUT I KEPT GETTING

IT'S PROBABLY BAD RECEPTION.

OH, SWEETIE, WE REALLY MISS YOU.

I HOPE YOU CAN STAY FOR LUNCH

WHEN YOU COME TO PICK UP ADAM
TOMORROW MORNING.

I KNOW YOUR FATHER WILL WANT

ANYWAY, GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN YOU GET HOME

IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE, OKAY?

CRITTERS.

LOVE YOU.
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU, HONEY.

[groans]

WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER?

SARA MCANDREWS,

THIS IS DEPUTY SANDERS CALLING

FROM THE COUNTY SHERRIFF'S
OFFICE.

I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

MY APOLOGIES FOR CALLING
SO LATE--

[answering machine beeps]

YOU KNOW--

S-SHE CAN'T HELP HERSELF,
CAN SHE, RIGHT?

SHE HAS TO FIND SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

NO, SHE IS THE ONE
THAT NEEDS TO SEE A DOCTOR,

'CAUSE SHE ALWAYS WANTS US
TO FEEL GUILTY

OR WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING.

YOU KNOW, BUT I--

I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO DO.

SHE CAN'T STAND
THAT HER LITTLE ANGEL

IS NOW INDEPENDENT
AND SO FAR AWAY FROM HER.

YOU KNOW, T-TOMORROW--


MM.

TOMORROW, TOMORROW, TOMORROW.

TONIGHT IS JUST YOU AND ME...
MM-HMM.

ALONE.

SO WHY DON'T YOU STOP TALKING?

MMM.
MMM.


HONEY.

WHAT?

I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

WHAT'S HER NAME?

SERIOUSLY?

WHAT'S HER NAME?

WHY DON'T YOU GO SERVE ME
SOMETHING TO DRINK

INSTEAD OF BEING SUCH A PERV.

[telephone beeps]

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
HE'S OKAY.

SHE SAID HE WAS FINE, BABY.

DON'T WORRY SO MUCH.

I'M YOUR BABY TONIGHT.

[laughs]

BABY, I REALLY HAVE
TO HAVE A SHOWER.

SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HERE

AND MAINTAIN YOUR CONCENTRATION?

CAN I SPY ON YOU
IN THE SHOWER?

DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

â™ª OH, I JUST MAY

I DON'T UNDERSTAND

WHY WE'RE ALWAYS HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?

[sighs]
YES.

I LEFT A MESSAGE
FOR THE SHERRIFF.

LEFT A MESSAGE?

WHAT KIND OF GODFORSAKEN PLACE
DID YOU MOVE TO?

LISTEN, MAKE SURE
THE DOORS ARE LOCKED.

YEP, THEY ARE LOCKED,
AND ALL OF THE LIGHTS ARE ON.

AND HOW ABOUT THAT HUSBAND
OF YOURS?

IS HE DOING ANYTHING
ABOUT IT?

WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

WELL, HE'S YOUR HUSBAND,
ISN'T HE?

LOOK, MOM, HE IS DOING
THE BEST THAT HE CAN.

â™ª

YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

I'M NOT EVEN SURE
THAT I SAW WHAT I SAW.

HONEY, IF YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE
OVER THERE,

YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE HERE.

YOU CAN STAY WITH US AS LONG
AS YOU LIKE, OKAY?

OKAY.

I'VE BEEN REALLY TIRED LATELY,

SO I'M GONNA GO AND SLEEP
FOR 100 YEARS.

OH, YOU DO THAT,
SLEEPING BEAUTY.

I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING.

MM-HMM.

GIVE ADAM A KISS FOR ME.

DON'T WORRY.

SWEET DREAMS, DARLING.

LOVE YOU.
