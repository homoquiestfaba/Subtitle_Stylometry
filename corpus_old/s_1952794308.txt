We called him Uncle Charlie.

How did it happen?

One night he walked into my
room and ate me.

How old were you?

Twelve.

His father heard?
Yes.

What did he do?

He took a knife and took it.

I mean that his father stabbed him?

No. He has recovered. He charged $ 20.

No!
Yes!

He said if someone were to fuck her son,
at least it would make money.

I think he was crazy.

Jesus.

And Uncle Charlie had friends too...

I mean that their father prostituted?

More or less.

Is more relaxed now?

Yes

Okay. I forgive you.

Let me look.

The skinny fag who told you?

He saw his picture and liked it a lot.

It's in my house now with friends.
We have some...

Eddy! It's me! Leon!

Do not pretend you do not know me.

I will never talk to you.
You hit my heart.

Leon! My God!
I know! All right?

Shit! As time passed?

I do not know. Do not embarrass me with time.

Join! I have coke!

Coca-coca to the ho-ho. Come on!

We worship you and it will be wonderful.

I do not know. It's a little late.

No school tomorrow, bitch?

Oh, naughty! Want to be

Come in, seriously, we miss you.

Come on! Come on!

Okay.

"Yeah?
-Yes!

Grab it, bitch. Make

Come on!

Sexy ass down the hall.

Bip. Bip Bip.

I'm back!

Silence because I have not talked.
Listen up girls:

I have a surprise for you.

I brought someone with me. Prepared?

It is the Eddy! Remember?

I've talked to you Eddy.

Take off your jacket and stand there a moment.

Take the liquor, nut. Let's drink.

It is good to drink to
last drop, I'll check.

This is Gary, our friend
writer and an alcoholic, right Gary?

Now, Eddy, you're right here...
At center stage.

This is Eddy.
I always spoke of him, remember?

Hello?

An adult is talking, do not remember?

Legal. Anyway
nobody listens to me.

Sure, you talk too much. How to cope?

My God! You're so cute!

Give me a little coke, bitch.

I went out for 4 minutes, I left everything
ready and you took over.

Eddy goes, let's smell.

Christ! What they did to
get this shit?

Eddy, smells.

Eddy is the best blowjobs...

this fucking universe.

And he makes no noise.

He has killed a pimp in
Romania or something.

Eddy deep throat.

It's his new name from now on.

Eddy

throat

deep!

Take a sniff!

I just remember.
But it is not the best part.

Can I tell?

Sure.

Ok, I'll tell them.

You see the only son of... wait...

Samuel Franklin Dobson, the former mayor.

Samuel Franklin Fuck Dobson
is not it, Eddy?

And you tell them what you
said when he found it.

Account you. Do you like this
story more than me.

Suit yourself, queer.

They came and raided a large
mansion terrorist, you know?

And yet deep throat
were vestiges of Go-Go.

And Dad was there... blah, blah, blah!
Not my child!

The mayor speaks, speaks, speaks...

Then he offers the throat
deep a truck full of money,

university education, a job...

And how is deep throat, you know...

Put end to this depraved life...
sinful to eat assholes.

Eddy said...

Father! I am as God made me,

and then you'd be a great sin.

I know the story!

"Kids Program"

Keanu Reeves, River Phoenix.

Shut your mouth!

I saw, you saw!
All the world saw gays.

I did not.

Yes, he is the son of the mayor, the governor's son...

See? This is the reason
for which no one speaks to you.

Is it because nobody listens.

If Eddy says that his father was mayor...
"It was prefect!

Thanks Eddy. So
His father was the mayor.

Yeah, okay, okay. This is the
fact that he has now.

"Want to go?
-No.

So shut up.

Your desires... I'm hearing.
Shut up!

Bitch! Always have to talk
something that fuck me!

Anyway, the small
Eddy had this great ultimatum:

Or she went to university...

or left the worldly life.

And she said I am as God made me?

A dirty assholes eater
unexpended swallower?

It is deserted, without a penny!

But it has bag! Picks up, it smells!

I'm fine.

Who are you?

Drug free! I use to
leading out of the house.

Not Eddy, finished drugs,
go home, you're a machine.

Here! Toma!

What's in the bottle?

Well ..

Give a glass to this man.

Because you're a man, not Eddy?

Yes

Little Miss Deep Throat.

You are the master clean and sober now.

You are a serious man?

I think I will ever know.

Beware of this attitude,
Mr. Dick Prandi.

Not big enough
for your ass off.

Cheeky, I love it!

Show off your dick
only the head, just the little eye...

How?

How?

I'm charging now.
Pay to play.

Oh, no!

My little Eddy grew.
I think I'll cry.

It's hard to see how they go.

No sir!
No longer dance, I'm not pissed.

It's a bitch who acts in good faith.

Only money! Please!

I am an agent of desire.

A what? I like that.

Do not ask me who I was,
so do not ask me to be the same.

Hey, "Grab-stick"! In what movie is?

Not a movie. It is Foucault.

Who?

No matter.

I met him dancing
the runway and thought only pick it up.

I managed to snare you!

Have you been born slut.

I took the boy home and
the rest is history.

They were good times, eh?

Best.

You made dinner...
-Yes!

We took care of each other, right?

Yes, we took care.

He was fond of this
boy, but never told him.

He ran for the hills, right?

Ah yes.

We made the party!

We had fun. We spent
day in the sun as they say.

They were good times, were not they?

Yes

Good times! Fucking good times!

Hey, hey!

Dirty slut!

Eddy.

You're a bitch, not Eddy?

Eeeeddy... Boy bitch.

He told the truth?

who said what?

Eddy, the son of the mayor.

I knew it.

I will not say to Leon.

He likes these things, you know.

The way things are.

I will not ask your name.

No matter... names.

Probably invent one.

But you're beautiful.

Thanks.

How did you discover?

You're too smart to
be one of the boys of Leon.

And do not use drugs.

No. You are not River Phoenix.

You know who you are?

Brad Davis
"Dying in your arms."

You saw "Querelle"?

Shame!

Leon... know...

he sees things your way.
As if the past was perfect.

How do you see?

See you.

Whoever you are,
thinking about me.

So... You really hustler?

Am.

No, not like that kind of thing.

Oh yeah? How do you like?

In luck, anonymous. I like adventures.

Agent desire.

Correct.

Right. So...

So...?

How much?

What do you want?

Suck my dick.

Cool.

Have change for 20 notes?

Joking, joking.

I think we will do up to 60.

Come here.

Do not worry about them.
Hardly come here.

Fuck.

Fuck.

It truly does suck a cock.

Practice.

Did you come right!

How?

It feels good, I like.

I think I went a little in my
eye, maybe I'll get a little blind.

I'll have to revise my health plan.

Alright then, Dirky.

I can smell my dick in your mouth.

Ask me how a gay man says goodbye.

As a gay man says goodbye?

I'll call you.

-Give me that!
"No!

-Let cows.
"I'll tell him.

Go fuck you, dick head!

Give me that. I want to use.
I'll burn your ass!

Stupid bitch!

Where was my young man?

Rifling through your stuff.

Found something cool?

Nothing worthwhile is stolen.

Was playing with the stick-handle, right?

I know where I was.

Do not lie, I can see in his eyes.

She sucked his dick? It was too big?

Bigger than yours.

"Bigger than yours"

What would you do without dicks?

In a world without poles, you'd starve.

It would be the last man on earth
trying to suck his own dick.

Why are all gone and he's hungry.

What are you doing?

I'm wearing.

Why?

Because it is the only way to put clothes.

No. It's more beautiful when naked.

Gotta go.

But just in.

I have school tomorrow, remember?

What? School to suck cocks?
You can practice here!

Oh, right.

<i>I'll call you!</i>

I forgot something in the car. Be right back.

Okay, back soon.

You are now in this building? Moved?

No. I was visiting some friends.

I can not find the way out.

It's a fucking maze.

Yes You know, the first time I went here
found equal to the Hotel Radiance, a maze.

I'm David.

Want something?

No, I just...

Sorry if I scared you earlier.

Do not scare me.
"You really...

I am like your friend.

Not a friend. Just... a guy.

How crazy, huh?
On the way we find...

Need help getting out?

Can I display output. It's easy.

It is not difficult. It is this direction.

What is this?

The laundry?

Man, this is the basement.

Where is the exit?

Look man...

It's there. It's there.

I just...

I just want...

Just want to ask you something, okay?

Ok

Go, question!

Look, I'm not gay, right?

Right.

I mean.... I have a wife and a girl.

It is magnificent.

But you... know, you...

You're not... I mean...
It's not like... As...

Like what?

As these boys!

These fags background
corridor. I hate those guys!

They make me sick.

But you and me.

We are two men.

What?

I want to suck.

Oh man...
I knew you were a fucking fag.

I told you, I'm not queer!

Sure, it's not queer.

Where do you want...

Here?

I dunno, man.

We can hear if someone comes.
We listen.

And I can pay you!
$ 40! $ 45.

And you just want to suck?

Why not let me fags
eat or kiss me.

I know, I know, okay... okay.

Come here.

Slower.

Stay back.

I said do not let me eat.

I want to suck your ass.

Stay back.

You like it?

I love it.

Dude, you really like ass.

Never did it but...

Dude...

Hey!

Back off, marginal!

Here we are.

Welcome to the apartment of the central cover.

Sit down.

Okay, let me see how it is.

Hold that.

You press a little. Be right back.

You must be a night owl, right?

Never sleep. Sleep is for young people.

Not like to sleep?

I love it. Sleeping and perchance to dream.

So I go to the laundry.

Laundry and books.

There is medicine for it.

Why? To the laundry?

To sleep.

Is there a remedy for everything.

Let me see.

Well, the bleeding stopped.

Yes, I think so.

Broke?

No, it's over.

Good

Sad to see this magnificent face hurt.

Time will tell. Believe me.

Let me take this.

They say that we face we deserve
when we get to forty years.

That is true. It's what they say?

Well, I stopped worrying long ago.

Let's see.

I think it will survive.

Boy, he'll hurt yourself.

No. I gave everything he wanted.

-Did you?
-Yes.

If it had not appeared,
would have given him a lesson.

Sorry to interrupt.

It was nothing.

And as you call it, finding my basement?

-Jeff.
-Jeff. Nice to meet you, Jeff.

"I am Sam.
-Nice to meet you.

There it is.

As new.

Ok, put it.

This rapid floods.

I thought the flat coverage
could escape the noise.

Flat roof.

Controlled rent. No noises.
But not counted in the rain.

Water everywhere. But not a drop to drink.

I would like to have a jungle here.

A jungle full of plants
to absorb the water.

Do you know where to put.

Moment of medicine.

Here you are.

Thanks.

No thanks.

No, seriously, thanks.

A drink to medicine.

So...

What did that guy down there?

Guess it was not to wash clothes.

Dude... is a long history.

Okay.

Well, let me see.

First he had tried to leave
building for an hour.

Trying to leave the building.

Yes, I could not leave this place.

It's an apartment building. It is not purgatory.

I know, but...

Was lost or .. I ended up perdento same.

It's like a puzzle, like a maze.

Well, it's a maze or a puzzle?

What is the difference?

A puzzle has pitfalls.
A labyrinth going somewhere.

Let me ask you something.

All men are gay this building?

I mean, there's something in the water or what?

I do not know.

I'm sure there are some
straight walking around.

But... this building is the gayest
Street and gayest city.

Is it a problem?

No.

Are you gay?

As the pink paint.

So...

Was in the hallway

and this guy said I could
show me the output.

So...

what happened?

He took me down there in the basement, e. ..

Yes ..

The first thing I did was
tell me that he was gay.

I see.

And then said he wanted
suck my dick.

And the guy who hit you?

He did not hit me. Just punched me.

Gave a strong and unexpected blow.

Really?

I'm telling you...

He had a look in the eyes of...

as if he wanted to kill me.

Maybe there is a problem with that. Poor guy.

I'll be fine.

You do not... he!

He is the bastard? Look at my face!

You were just lost.
He is who is caught.

How is he caught?

What do you mean?
Because he thinks that is not a man?

Because he craves a dick
and live a lie? Is that it?

Because it is not easy for him? Right?

I mean, nobody can know who are you?

And you, sir?

What?

If someone asks "Who are you?"

I'm only one guy.

Just a guy.

How do you even see?

I mean, as a man?

I mean, how gay?

I do not know.

I think, I mean... suck cocks.

Well, it's a good start.

Yes, and not ashamed of it.

Good for you.

I like to have sex with other guys.

I like to involve them, and fuck.

What kind of guys?

Any kind.

But I do not... I'm not gay.

You know, I mean, I am.

But do not go to gay parades.

Do not live in the light of the rainbow.

Do not want to get married.

So you are not politicized.

Yes

But the act of loving a man
is in itself a political statement

huh?

Never fell in love with a guy.

Do not crush on a guy, yet.

Right. There I fell in love with a guy, yet.

And since I had sex with girls.

Oh, you did it? And me too!

But you said you're gay.

You know what? Fuck gay.

Yes, fuck the gay.

Fuck. Do not believe it.

But believe in you.

You know, guys like me have fought on the frontline.

Guys like you have allowed your
the luxury of being show.

Already took a punch.

Yes, I was punched.

So you're not gay.

Maybe you're just... weird.

Maybe.

Or maybe it's just a traveler
visiting places of interest.

Maybe.

A nomad explorer.

Maybe it's just a frat boy.

Maybe you're just a tourist.

Maybe I'm just a hustler.

Maybe?

When you say... hustler...

Oh God!

Old man, you really like to fuck.

You have no idea how...

From when I needed.

Our mother!

Hey, do not... not so.

Ok, so.

Here you are.

Our mother! That tail tastier.

Made this old man very happy, my son.

Older men fuck better.

Is this true?

Yes

Why?

I do not know.

They care about what you feel.

Young people just...

Well, it's cool to say that.

I think they would be equal
if you had more years.

I still prefer older men ..

Some of the men who had sex with
become a customer?

No.

What a shame.

I wonder why.

I like everything new.

Ah yes... again.

Nothing is new in the world, kid.

So it's new to me.

What will you do when you have
known all the men?

When you have fucked with all the city's gay?

This.

I was speechless.

The hero of migration.

That's it. I'll take me where my body.

I like that.

I like the way you think, so,
wandering somewhere.

Bringing joy to the world.

For a price.

Right. We can not give pleasure to
ourselves, is not it?

No one is selfless.

A man always needs to eat more.

Whatever.

Pay rent.

Oh yes, rent.

And go to school, perhaps?

Possibly.

What?

That's beautiful.

Handsome boy.

-Sam?
"Yeah?

How old are you?

I am old as the sun. And you?

See them there?

Flowers?

Yes, I see.

Are my age.

No. .. No, son.

You're older than them.

Your body may be young, but...

Ali. See that picture?

It's the age you are.

Shit!

Hello!

Still here?

Yes

I think this place does not want me to go.

I forgot. You're the dick-Grab
or pants-colada?

Only Gary, ok?

Legal.

Anything I can do?

Wait, wait.

Speech.

Refers to that?

Absolutely.

Sit.

Accepts a wine?

Wine, cool.

Health

So...

I put a song?

Sure.
-Yes?

I have a good repertoire.

It's right here?

When he entered the house
Leon I was crazy.

You know, those things you feel in your stomach,

he never knew, but it's like
if you knew long ago.

It's a crazy dream.

But I swear... I dreamed about you.

Us sonhecemos two hours ago.
"I know.

That's the crazy part...

Or creepy.
But you're not creepy.

This is... cool.
What time is it?

I do not know. I think it's too late.

I'll never get to sleep

Want to go?

"Are you nervous?
"My God, I am!

It's okay.

-I leave you nervous?
-Yes.

Why?

I guess because you're beautiful.

For me, I mean.

Thanks.

Can I ask you a question?

Sure.

You really hustler?

Yes

You. .. lay with Jacob?

I do not know. Who is Jacob?

Dirky. Leon calls him Dirky.

Ah yes.

I lay with him.

I take it?

Yes, please excuse me.

Thanks.

I have a little money.

Legal.

I think you want...

Sure.

Ok

So...

How much?

Depends.

What is thought?

I. ..

Really want to kiss you.

Speak again.

I just want to kiss you.

You are kidding, right?

No.

Sorry... I do not kiss.

Why?

I do not know. It is very... so...
It's so...

Intimate?

This.

It is very real.

Yes

$ 100 to kiss me.

I am a great kisser.
I swear, I swear I am.

I'm sure you are!

But... you're very beautiful.

Should find someone who...

But I want to kiss you.

150? 160?

Dude!

Should be more than
got all night.

You have no idea how much
finally made tonight.

"Why?
-Why what?

Why me? And why now?

And do not tell me that's why dream of me.

You were right, it's horrifying.

I mean, we can not just fucking?

No, I do not want.... Do not want to fuck.

I want to...

I want to kiss you.

I want to kiss you. I want to kiss you deeply.

Per day.

Why?

Because if you kiss me, I will not be alone.

You know? Alone, alone.

Five minutes of shit.

Then when you go, when...

Can I have...

Can I have every kiss,
I remember every kiss.

Because the kiss will be mine.

Because it will touch my soul.

That's where I really need to be touched now.

Not on my stick, or in my hole...

Here, here, is here in this hole.

And I'll pay for it.

I'll be happy paying for it.

Are the economics of your life?

Toma. 200, $ 200.

All you need do is kiss me.

What happens is I "do not touch your soul"?

You can laugh if you want.

I'm not laughing at you.

Dude, if I can not?

It's a risk I take.

Ok

So let's kiss the soul.

Really?

Seriously. Give me that fucking money.

Okay. How do you want?

Here.

Here?

Yes

So?

No.

What?

It is a good kisser.

Come here.

What? What?

Nobody ever kissed me like that before.

Are you okay?

Yes, yes, that is...

What?

Nothing.

Feeling?

I'm feeling, I'm feeling.

Kiss me.

Shit!

Shit!

Do not believe I actually enjoyed that.

Me too, me too.

Are you sleeping?

No. I'm awake.

I can hear your heart.

I love to look like, but my
leg is numb.

Sorry.

What dizzy!

Hey, get there.

Thanks.

Hey, here, here.

Basket.

Guards later.

It's what you wanted?

Yes, that was it.

I feel it all over again, you know?

What?

I raise myself in my current love.

Born of light rain.

Full of you.

And lost.

And then the light hits my eyes.

View mirror of my soul.

And come together again.

Wrote it?

No, but... I write.

Who is this?

It's me!

I took my mother's house.

It's a memory I do not know.

You gave me inspiration.

You know, you can stay if you want.

No, no. Gotta go.

I have to continue.

Toma.

What is this?

It is a griffin.

It's magic... the sun.

Guard a treasure.
