This is J.T.L. Morning News.

This is Holly Chadwick.

Thanks forjoining us.

We have a great show
in store for you this morning.

Well, it's a great morning
to be in the studio.

Authorities have confirmed
an avian flu outbreak.

Forecast, cloudy skies...

Good morning. Reporting from Brighton.

This will be a different scenario

if the virus changes in a way that allows
transmission between humans.

So, let's get started.

Yet again today,

another group of dolphins
became stranded.

CO2 emissions have
dramatically increased in...

Are there any
real threats that you know of?

Not at all.

Environmentalists are trying

to determine the cause of death.

At alert level six,

W.H.O. guidelines for governments...

Your socks are so cutei I like them.

Police say they've seen
similar cases recently

of people behaving strangely.

The U.N. health agency is not likely

to recommend official travel restrictions.

It's a little bit unsettling.

They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.

They think it's just gonna go away.

They live in a fantasy parallel universe.

Right on top of the man, beating him.

The man is bleeding.

Twenty-one confirmed cases.

All the talk
about a doomsday is a big hoax.

The subject growled at him

and continued to maul the victim.

The best estimate
is about 15,000 in the U.K.

We don't know if this is spreading.

Rhythms of change...

So far there's no manifestation.

Monitors have arrived,
even carrying them...

With that much
public at risk, we cannot...

They're trying to move us on,
trying to tell the journalists to get out.

Wake upi

Oh, creatures in our bed...

No sleepingi

Oh, you're getting very big.

What do you want to eat?
Pancakesi

We got a lot more sunshine today.

You have to only say one word.

Hey, by the way,
what do you want for your birthday?

Say a puppy.

A puppy.

You mean a stuffed animal puppy?

Because that we can do.

Good morning. That looks yummy.

She gets the bigger one?

Yeah, sorry.
She's tiny.

Did you pack your inhaler?

Bathroom sink.

In a minute?
Scootchi Go.

The government
has declared martial law.

Daddy, what's martial law?

Martial law is like house rules,
but for everybody.

Were you ever
in places like that with your old job?

But I quit my old job
so I could be with you.

Do you miss it?

No, I like my new job.

All you do is make pancakes
in the morningi

Yeah, but I'm really good at it.

Look who I foundi

Here comes the number 12 train!

It's not Subway Sam, is it?

You want more pancakes?

Good.

Go, go, go. Come on, scootchi

At least...
Move it on out.

Heyi Plates in the sinki

Lateri
Do that when we get backi

Does it live in the jungle?

No.

Do you eat it on Sundays?

No.

Does it live
on the Great Plains of Africa?

Yeah.
Oh, well, I guess, yeah.

Do people keep it in pens all its
life and harvest it for meat?

That's really grossi
Grossi

Dadi

Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?

Yes.
Is it a cat?

Yes.

Okay, now we have another one.
Do another one.

You totally got onei

Why are there so many?

It's like, three in the last five minutes.

What is going on?

The World Health Organisation
has been

tracking the recent outbreak of rabies

that began in Taiwan and has now been
reported in over 12 countries.

Responding to allegations he hasn't
done enough to prevent the spread...

Can we try BBC?

You're not British any more, baby.

You lost your accent a long time ago.

Except after two bottles of wine.

Am I British?

Yeah, your grandma is.

Heyi

He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?

Hold on, guys.

Daddy, be careful on the road.

It's okay, baby.

Can be transmitted between species

commonly from a bite
from an infected animal.

Our best recommendation is to stay
away from densely populated areas.

Hey, yoi You all right?

Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

You need anything?
No. You know what's going on?

No, man, I don't know anything.

It's crazy.

Gerry?

Get back in your car right nowi

Remain with your ve...

What are we doing?

That's our way out of here.

I want my blanketi

Baby, it's packed right now.

Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?

to get back in your seat.

Baby, we need you in your seat.

We should get out.

Everybody out of the car.

We've got to get out of the city.

Her door won't openi
Rachel, go out that side.

Okay, you have to climb over, honey.

Out of the wayi

Come on, honey. Come on.

Sweetheart, are you okay?

We got to get off the street.

We're pulling back on Fifth Street!

Containment is a fail.

Try to relax.

Give yourself air.

In and out.

Come on, baby, try to relax.

Gerry? We left my purse in the car.

Where's her spare?

I'm gonna go check
your backpack, all right?

Do you want to be with her?

Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

Hey, hey, you breathe
through your nose.

Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.

You're gonna be all right.

You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.

Breathe in through your nose,
out through your mouth.

Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.

We gotta move.

Okay.

Good. Good. Look.

Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.

No, no, no, no...

You're gonna be all right.

Look at me.
Daddy, what are those things?

Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.

It's Thierry.

Where are you?

Airborne. Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.

It's all gone. We barely made it out.

Tell him to go south.
No, no, we need visual confirmation.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

What is this?

We don't know. How close were you?

Face to face.

Good, honey, good.

Daddy.

Connie, give me that.

Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.

Where are you?

95, heading north.

Okay. Okay.

All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.

I'll call you back with an extraction point.

Can you hold out for another hour?

Do we have a choice?

This is not
for old time's sake, my friend.

I'll need you.

I need you back.

Don't forget about us.

What do you mean, we've lost Boston?

All right. Good luck, Gerry.

Okay.

Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.

Come here. Stay close.
Super close.

Take my hand.

Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.

I'll meet you back here.

Stay close, honey.

What do you need?

Albuterol.

They outgrow the asthma supposedly.

And this shit, too. it's magic for my kid.

Thank you.

The earliest would be sunrise.

Sunrise.

Tell him I got flares.

We'll be on the roof with flares.

Are you guys hungry?

Yes, thank you.

Here you go.
Thank you.

Thank you.

You want some juice?

The following message

is transmitted at the request of the
New Jersey State Police Department.

Authorities recommend
that the following actions

should be taken
by all the members of the public.

Stay indoors if at all possible.

Have enough food
and water supplies for sheltering

for one to two weeks.

The following message
is transmitted at the request

of the New Jersey State
Police Department.

An unidentified virus strain is rapidly

spreading across
the state of New Jersey.

She was crying.

Thanks, Tommy.

I used to work in dangerous places

and people who moved survived,
and those who didn't...

Movement is life.

You have a better chance
if you come with us.

You need anything else
before you leave?

Okay. Come on. Come on.

We should have left with them.

There is nowhere to go.

What's going to happen
when the food is gone?

Okay, come on.

I'm scared.

Connie, there's a helicopter
waiting for us on the roof.

Keep your eyes
on Mommy and Daddy, okay?

Be ninja quiet.

Just a walk in the park.

How do we know they're coming?

They're coming.

Okay, come on, guys.

Traffic en route, altitude 5-7 thousand.

Heading 250. Turn right,
heading 075, once clear.

Remain below 4,000.

Clear to land,
heading 040, wind 060 at five.

Follow L.S.O. directions.
Prep for immediate dust off.

Gerry.

Thank you.

Good to see you, my friend.

Tango five, this is Argus command.

Cleared for take-off.

Tango five. Wilco.

Karin, to the right.

This is good, right?

Bunk bedsi

Your bunk beds
are number two, three and six.

Please make yourself at home.

You want to get up here?

There you go, sweetheart.
That's good.

We're not dropping anchor again.

You're safe.

It's not me I'm worried about.

They're safe.

Baby.

It's bigger than
our old apartment on 72nd.

Need anything, Karin?

Water.

I'll organise.

Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?

Baby. Go talk somewhere else.

Okay.

The President is dead.

Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.

Reports of gun battles
in the streets of the capital.

Your parties are panicking.

The bigger cities are the worst off.

The airlines
were the perfect delivery system.

Carnival cruise vessel Dream
has been given permission to join.

Twenty seven knots south and closing.

How soon are they showing
symptoms after contact?

The provisional
government currently considers

northern Minnesota
to be a potential safe zone.

Have you recorded any instance where
a person was bitten but not infected?

How the hell do I know
if Russia's fallen?

Sir, I cannot action that order.

Colonel, I'm sorry,
but we cannot facilitate

an evacuation for you or your men.

Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.

Malnutrition. Dirty water.

No gas for the winter or transportation.

No bullets to fight.

And it has spread
to all corners of the globe.

The question
that we have got to address

is what the hell is it?

About 5% of the population
aren't affected immediately.

It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.

And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.

We find it, contain it...
That's Dr Fassbach.

Virologist from Harvard.

The analogy I keep coming back to

is Spanish Flu.

Spanish Flu?

It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,

it killed 3% of the world.

He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.

You all read the same email I did,

and it said "zombies."

Are you completely out of your mind?

So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"

was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.

We haven't had contact with them since.

But this could lead us to the origin.

If we knew where this thing started,

then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.

So we send in Dr Fassbach
there to look for the source.

He's just a kid.

You're right.

Attention on decki

At easei

Mr Under-Secretary.

The Under-Secretary
here says you were

his best investigator
when you were at the U.N.

I want to send you in. With a team.

Help Dr Fassbach
find whatever it is he needs.

You brought...

I wanted for the circumstances
to speak for themselves.

No.

Captain, I'm not your guy.

You were on the ground
during the Liberian Civil War.

Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.

Places you and I both know
Dr Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.

Gerry, a handful of SEALs
will go with you as security force.

No.

My guys will get you in,
you assist the doctor,

pursue any leads,
my guys will get you out.

We do the heavy lifting.

I can't help you. I can't leave my family.

Take a look around here, Mr Lane.

Each and every one of these people are
here because they serve a purpose.

There's no room here
for non-essential personnel.

There's a long line of people

waiting for one of those bunks.

You want to help your family,

let's figure out how we stop this.

It's your choice, Mr Lane.

Simple.

You don't work for them any more.

Karin...
You might not remember

what this job did to you, but I do.

So do not ask me to say yes to this.

I have to go.

They're going to kick us off the ship.

What?

If I go, you, the girls, Tommy,
have a place to stay.

If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.

What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?

Men like Thierry
aren't in charge of anything any more.

You keep this with you.

I'll call in once a day.

As long as I make that call,
everything's gonna be okay.

I'm coming back.

Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.

As we do.

Like we do.

Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.

I'm not a baby.

Okay.

Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.

I'll be back soon.

Yeah?

All right, tough guy...

Take care of the ladies for me?

Yeah.

Deal.

You're awesome.

Daddy's coming back.

This way, sir.

Look.

We don't know what we're walking into.

So we do what they say. Okay.

If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.

If things were to get crazy,

just focus on their boots,

focus on their voices,
and we'll be all right.

These guys are hammers.

And to hammers,
everything looks like nails.

I heard that.

You were meant to.

So, you see something that's important,

you call it out and we'll make it happen.

Okay.

You think we're gonna find anything?

Yeah.

Yeah, we're gonna find something.

Mother Nature is a serial killer.

No one's better.

More creative.

But like all serial killers,

she can't help the urge
to want to get caught.

What good are all those brilliant crimes

if no one takes the credit?

So she leaves crumbs.

Now, the hard part,
why you spend a decade in school,

is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.

Sometimes the thing you thought

was the most brutal aspect of the virus,

turns out to be the chink in its armour.

And she loves disguising
her weaknesses as strengths.

She's a bitch.

Attention. D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,

D.C. has gone dark.

The Capitol evacuation
has been suspended.

All available resources should be
directed to Naval Station Norfolk.

All non-essential personnel

given F-6 status
and in groups A through E

need to report
to the flight deck for relocation.

Groups A and B relocating to Orlando

should be on the stern
clear of the landing zone.

I say again, all non-essential
personnel given F-6 status

need to report to the flight deck.

Choppers are inbound
for immediate relocation.

Mommy, is this dinner?

Yes, sweetheart.

Water here tastes funny.

It's jet fuel, young lady.

He's joking.

I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.

Probably because
there's too many people on this ship.

Everybody wake up.

We're on approach
to Camp Humphreys.

Most of the base is dark,
and no one is manning the tower.

We're running on fumes,
so there's really no choice,

I've got to put us down.

So buckle up.

Hold up.

Keep your finger off the trigger.

Okay.

Fassbachi Waiti

Damn it.

Move backi

Friendlyi Friendlyi
Keep it down. Keep it down.

What is this? What happened to him?

He slipped. He's dead.

Come oni Come oni Let's goi Let's goi

Okay, I'm goodi

Who was it? Who fell?
Skilken.

Holdi Clear.
Hold.

I want an ammo count,
then you reload your magsi

Yes, siri

My boy who just died out there was 23.

He was 23.

You want to tell me why?

Because the guy who just shot
himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.

What are you talking about?

He was supposed to be our best hope.

Well, he's not our best hope any more.

Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.

He didn't have to, you know.

None of them did.

We're trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.

Well, shit happens.

The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.

How do we go about refuelling?

When I say so. And very carefully.

The noise, are they drawn to it?

Yeah. Sound draws them.

Body shots only seem
to slow them down.

Head shots do the trick,
but just to be safe

we tend to burn them when we can.

You fought any Zeke yet?
Yeah.

Where?
Philly. Newark.

Bad?

What about Houston?
St Louis?

Baltimore?
Atlanta?

Detroit?

Guys, I'll be honest with you...

I don't know of any place back
home that's doing very well.

All right...

if the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?

There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.

It had the word "zombie" in it.

Do you know anything about it?

Yeah.

It was an email, not a memo.

Pretty obvious
nobody back home bothered to read it.

Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.

Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten

trying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.

Now, our colonel
said he was the first one.

This colonel, is he around?

Oh, yeah. He's right here.

The guy who's shackled, do you know

who bit him, what bit him?

He was the base doctor.

He'd just returned from the field.

He'd been sent out
to verify the death of a soldier

who had just gone AWOL
the week before.

Some villagers had found this guy

foaming at the mouth,
oozing some kind of black tar.

Then he tried to bite one of them.

They shot him, tied him up,
threw him in a barn.

That's all we know, except the doctor

comes back here
and begins attacking his patients.

This soldier,
do you know where he came from?

No.

Anyone he might
have come in contact with?

No.

There's got to be records.

You are welcome
to take a look if you want.

Then the origin could
have come from anywhere.

It's a shame you had to fly

all the way out here to figure that out.

How did you all escape this?

The expenditure of ammunition.

Is that how you tweaked your leg?

No, shit's been bugging me a while.

This fool stands right in the mix,

while seven or eight of them

turn Zeke all at the same time.

But they got no time
for Ol' Dirty Bastard here.

Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.

Got no time for his lucky ass.

Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?

The ones I saw bitten
turned in 12 seconds. Same here?

Five or 10 minutes.

Yeah, Davidson went
and he turned in 10 minutes.

"Stevie?

"Captain Spekesi Oh, my Godi
My Godi Are they eating me?"

Who's that?

Waste no time on that freak.

He's C.l.A.

Got caught selling guns to North Korea.

Davidson,

he turned in 10 minutes.

That doesn't sound viral
to me at all, sports fansi

You're with the C.l.A.?

But they're not with me.

And who are you?

U.N.

Oh, my Godi

Captain, put on the World Musici

The day

is savedi

Why'd you sell guns to the North?

Why not?

Are they surviving this?

Indeed they are.

Using your guns.

Guns are half-measures.

How then?

They pulled the teeth of all 23 million

in less than 24 hours.

The greatest feat
of social engineering in history.

It's brilliant.

No teeth,

no bite.

No great spread.

Bullshit.

More books,
fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.

Now, why do you have to burn them

to ashes to get them to finally stop?

Why do they move like a plague?

Why is lsrael winning?

How is lsrael winning?

They sealed off their entire country

days before the undead attacked man.

First to know,

first to act.

People have been
building walls there for two millennia.

Right. Yeah, but,

finish all those

thousands of years of work a week ago?

Impeccable timing is all.

You want answers?

Jurgen Warmbrunn.

That's the man
in Jerusalem you want to see.

You ever seen anything like that?

Hell, no.

We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.

Oh, hang on.

Hang on a minute.

Hello?

Gerry?

Honey?
Gerry, can you hear me?

Karin?

Hello?

God damn iti

Give me your hand.

No way. No.

My mother. Dallas.

Probably pacing a hole
in the floor right now if she's still there.

Better chance of you seeing
her before me, that's all.

It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.

Better the devil you know
than the one you don't.

You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.

Make sure Maverick here keeps
the nose of that plane

pointed towards the sun.

Just remember, don't lock
the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.

Tell me 10 more times.

You good?
Right here.

All right. Don't rush.

We've got one chance
to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.

If you ain't a crack shot,
don't aim for the head,

just get Zeke on the ground.

Remember, "Spine's divine,
those knees they work just finei"

Let's go, lights outi

Alpha in position.

Bravo moving out.

Remember, these things
are drawn to sound.

So I need you close to target
before I bring you the truck.

Now there's only one way
we're getting you on that plane,

and that's quietly.

Shiti

God damn iti Shut that thing offi

Looks like we just woke the dead.

Out of respect for others,

please turn off all pagers
and cell phones.

We got to move.

We've got to get out of here, let's movei

Go, go, goi

I'm gonna clear a path through Zekei

You pedal like helli

Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!

I want to see some Zeke on the ground!

You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.

I got you, Captain. Just say the word.

It's all right, boys. I got this one.

God damn it.
We got enoughi

We need to detach the fuel linei

lsrael better pay off.

All right, I have instrument,
but only on single prop.

You'll have to talk me through it.

Okay, we're clear.

Okay. Give me all the lights.

Switch on the anti-icing.

Where?
The red knob.

Got it, got it.
Set up our heading 020 for departure.

We got to movei
Set flaps 15 degrees.

Flaps 15.

All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of herei

Make it steep.

Gerry?
Hi, baby.

Hi. Hi.

I tried to call you.

I know, I was...

it was bad timing, I was running around.

Are you okay?

Yeah, everything's okay. I'm okay.

That's the spirit.

Yeah.

Listen...

Korea didn't work out.

Now it looks like
we're gonna have to go to lsrael.

Try to get some rest on the flight.

How are the kids?

I think...

They're really... They're good.

I got Connie right here.

Baby?

Attention, unidentified aircraft.

You are in a restricted airspace
and not clear for landing.

Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.

Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.

Contact Mossad,
office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.

Special Envoy, United Nations.

Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.

The problem with most people is that

they don't believe
something can happen

until it already has.

It's not stupidity or weakness.

It's just human nature.

How did you know?

Gerald Lane.

Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad

about his employer,
the U.N., back in 2010.

Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.

Thought you'd have parlayed
those ripples into a self-righteous book.

No nose for profit.

How did lsrael know?

We intercepted a communique
from an lndian general

saying they were
fighting the Rakshasha.

Translation, zombies.

Technically undead.

Jurgen Warmbrunn.

High-ranking official in the Mossad.

Described as sober, efficient,
not terribly imaginative.

And yet you build a wall
because you read a communique

that mentions the word "Zombie"?

Well, when put like that,
I'd be sceptical as well.

In the '30s, Jews refused to believe

they could be sent
to concentration camps.

In '72, we refused to fathom we'd be
massacred in the Olympics.

In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,

and we unanimously agreed
they didn't pose a threat.

Well, a month later, the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea.

So we decided to make a change.

A change?

The Tenth Man.

If nine of us
look at the same information

and arrive at the exact same conclusion,

it's the duty of the tenth
man to disagree.

No matter how improbable it may seem,

the tenth man has to start digging

on the assumption
that the other nine are wrong.

And you were that tenth man.

Precisely.

Since everyone assumed that this talk of
zombies was cover for something else,

I began my investigation
on the assumption

that when they said "zombies,"
they meant zombies.

Was patient zero from lndia?

That's the problem.

There's so many
potential sources in play

that no one knows where it began.

The organ trade in Germany.

Strange examples of violent behaviour
across the Asian peninsulas.

Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps
spreading, and we do what we can.

These are
the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.

Two of 10 portals

through the security perimeter
into fortified lsrael.

You're letting people in.

Every human being we save
is one less zombie to fight.

It's okay.

If I could get into lndia, where
would I start? Who would I speak with?

India's a black hole.

Forget about patient zero.

I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.

I'm running out of time. I need specifics.

I need answers...
I don't have answers.

All you can do is find a way to hide.

Get troops down there.

It's too loudi it's too loudi

They're coming over the topi

Shiti

Get him to Jaffa Gate.

She'll get you out of here,
she'll get you to your planet

Wrong wayi Wrong wayi

Go to landing point B.

Roger, we are inbound
to landing point B.

Hawk 5, almost there.

Hawk 5. Hawk 5,
you're patched in. Over.

This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.

The city is breached,
and they're heading towards the airport.

One thousand one.

One thousand two.

One thousand three. One thousand four.

One thousand five.

One thousand six.

One thousand seven.

One thousand eight.

We got to move.

You'll be all right.

You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turni

We got to move.

We got to movei

Chopper 5 is down.

I say again, chopper 5 is down.

LZ is overrun.

Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.

Tower to 394. Proceed to runway four.

Good luck out there.

Noi

Therei That onei

Stop. Stop.

Goi Goi

Get them out of herei

Stay calm, please. Stay calm.

Come on. Go, go, go.

What's your destination?

I don't know. We were headed here,
but I don't know.

I'm Gerry, by the way.

Segen.

Segen.

First or last?

Just Segen.

So, what we're doing,

we've got to change this bandage
and we're gonna clean it.

Okay?

You okay? Okay?

Okay.

Come on, gut up. Gut up.

Here we go.

We're almost there.

Okay. Big breaths.

Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.

Here we go.

Come on. Good.

Last step. Last step.

Big breath.

Good job. There it is. Okay.

Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.

Very good. Okay.

You a doctor?

No.

I've had some training in the field.

How did you know?

Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?

I didn't.

Now I'm just a liability.

This fool

stands right in the mix,

while seven or eight of them

turn Zeke all at the same time.

Is that how you tweaked your leg?

No, shit's been bugging me a while.

Got no time for his lucky ass.

Now, the hard part is seeing the crumbs

for the clues they are.

And sometimes the thing you thought

was the most brutal aspect of the virus

turns out to be the chink in its armour.

I don't have answers.

All you can do is find a way to hide.

Gerry?

Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?

I love you. I'm sorry.

But you've got to get Thierry now.

I'll find him.

Thierryi Thierry.
Excuse me. Karin.

Gerry needs you. I love you.

Gerry? Where are you?

On the last flight out.

Listen, my phone is dying
and I need some quick intel.

You gotta locate the closest
medical research facility.

A C.D.C., a W.H.O.,
something that makes vaccines.

And the closest airport to it.
I don't understand.

No time to explain.

Just make it happen, man.

Okay, okay.

But Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.

Well, go and find out what he needs.

You're gonna want to take this.

Take it.

Your battery is dead.

We made contact
with Cardiff Airport, Wales.

Your people directed us.

There is W.H.O.
research facility nearby,

but they are not sure
it's still operational.

This is location.

Can we make it?

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain.

I'm glad to report that
we are on our final approach

to Cardiff Airport in Wales.

All European airports
are under lockdown.

But we have been given
priority status and cleared for landing.

We will be allowed to disembark.

We are very, very lucky.

Hey. Who do you belong to?

What's there?

What is it?

You... Bags.

We need trolley and bags.

Mayday, mayday, maydayi
Bravo 160 heavy.

Emergency descenti

Prepare for impact.

Got to move.

Got to move.

Got to move.

Come on, come on.

Give me something good.

Sir, Cardiff Airport
lost contact with the plane.

Lane is M.l.A. I'm sorry, sir.

Chopper inbound for
immediate relocation.

I say again.

All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status

need to report for immediate relocation.

Ma'am?

Thierry would like a word with you.

Captain, it's only been 48 hours.

He's a resourceful man. There's every
chance he could have survived.

Sir, I gave him my word
we would look after his family.

Yes, sir. I understand.

Okay. Let's go. We're good.

Daddy!

Daddyi

You're a tough bastard.

And a lucky one.

Who are you?

I came here with a... With a woman.

Is she still...

Who are you?
Why have you come here?

Why do you keep looking at him?

'Cause he's the one in charge.

You know what this place is?

Of course I do. That's why I'm here.

Then you understand
how this must look to us.

This

is important to you?

How long have I been out?
Three days.

Give me the phone.

Just give me the phone.

Give me the God damn phonei
Give me the phonei

As soon as you answer my question.

Call it.

Call the number,
they'll tell you who I am. Call it.

Gerry?

Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
My God.

We thought you were dead.

Gerry, where are you?

Thierry, I'm with
a couple of nervous gentlemen.

They need some bona fides
before I can speak with you.

Of course.

This is Thierry Umutoni.

Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.

To whom am I speaking?

Where's Karin?

Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?

I'm sorry, Gerry.

I did what I could.

What does that mean?

You've got to calm down.
No, stopi Stop.

You're going to hurt yourself.

You're okay.

His family has been sent
to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.

I'm sure they'll be safe.

Are you? Thierry told you
who I am and what I used to do, right?

Yeah.

Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.

I understand how you feel.

Do you? Yes?
Yes.

Do you have a family?

No.
No.

Then you couldn't possibly understand,
could you?

I lost my son and wife in Rome.

Rather, I lost my son to

something that had once been my wife.

We have all lost someone, Mr Lane.

In your case, there is hope at least.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Now,

why did you come here?

What do you need from us?

Your worst disease.

He wants a what?

Deadly pathogen.

With a high mortality rate.

But curable.
Okay, well, um...

You'd want a bacteria
rather than a virus,

I would think. Typhus?

Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.

Rocky Mountain Fever.

Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?

Mr Lane believes we can use
such a disease against the undead.

I would give you points
for originality, Mr Lane,

if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.

One of the many things a virus or
bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.

A functioning circulatory system.

I'm afraid it boils down
to one simple fact...

You can't make a dead person sick.

It's not for them.

It's for us.

I believe these things have a weakness.

And that weakness is weakness.

Our weakness.

I have witnessed them
literally bypass people.

Walk right around them like
a river around a rock. Why?

I think, because those people were sick.

I think they were terminal.

And these things could sense it.

I think they're spreading a pathogen,

and they need a healthy host.

But even if you're right, I mean,
infecting the populace

with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.

It's not a cure. it's camouflage.

It's camouflage.

There's a natural precedent.

Hungry predators
will avoid diseased bodies.

Equipped with the right pathogen,
our troops

would be essentially
invisible to the enemy.

You understand the only way to prove
this theory of yours is

for some idiot to infect themselves

with a lethal pathogen and then...

...meet with her, face to face.

Yes.

Do we have what we need to try it?

We have all he could want.

Typhus, H1 N1, SARS.

The problem is,

they're all stored in B-Wing.

What's the matter with B-Wing?

Dr Spellman. Our chief vaccinologist.

Within hours of the outbreak,
he'd been sent blood samples

to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.

Unfortunately...

This is B-Wing now.

God damn it.

How many?

How many are there?

There were 80 people working there.

I've never seen them move like that.

They're dormant.

They're awaiting stimulus.

Now, this

is vault 139.

That's where your samples would be.

This is the skybridge.

That connects B-Wing
to the main building here.

And this, is the only thing
standing between us and the skybridge.

So,

what do you propose, Mr Lane?

You are not serious.

B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.

We don't even know
if his theory is correct.

Well, I know I'm not asking
one of you to take him there.

Each has its merits.

Last resort.
It's too loud.

Let's go.

Try not to kill one.

It only makes
the rest of them more aggressive.

Yeah.

You sure you want to do this?

Of course I'm not. Let's go.

Good luck.

See you all shortly.

Good luck.

If anything comes down this hall before
we do, you seal these doors for good.

Understood?
Okay.

There they are.

Go, go.

Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

Come oni

They're fine. They're fine.

Shit.

The vault we need is in 139.

Goi

Oh, my God.

Left, left, lefti

What are you doing?

She'll get you to the vault.

That's the vault.

We can make it.
No, we can't.

We can't make it. Let's goi

They're not gonna make it.

You heard what Javi said,
we cannot open it.

They're not alone, we can't open iti

They are coming backi

We can't leave them there.

Come oni

Open the doori

Runi
Runi

Runi Faster, come oni

Runi

In, in, ini

Come oni

Now where is Gerry?

Where is he, where is he, where is he?

Come on, come on, where are you?

5-6-9-6-4.

5-6-9-6-4.

What happened to Gerry?

Not that one. Not that one.

Oh, shiti

Shiti

Jesus.

He's going to inject himself.

We have no idea
which one's going to work.

We don't know if any of them will work.

If he uses anything
he took from that left case,

he's dead anyway.

What's he doing?

How long does he have to wait?

Before he's infected? Not long, but,

that's not the question
we're really asking, is it?

Look at them.

He just walked right past himi

He walked right past himi

Like it was nobodyi

Okay.

This isn't the end.

Not even close.

Hi, there. This is...

This is Amy. Is anyone out there?

Hello. I'm trying
to get in contact with anyone.

We've had some luck
finding people with this transmission.

We've lost entire cities.

When there's
no more people left to infect,

they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.

The World Health Organisation

reports today that help may soon...

...a hybridized meningitis strain

with components of smallpox and H1N1 .

We still don't know how it started.

The World Health Organisation
has created

a vaccine that works
as a kind of camouflage,

making people who receive it
invisible to the infected.

We bought ourselves some time.

Volunteer forces
are delivering the vaccine

to areas that have been cordoned off.

Distribution efforts
began in earnest on April 10th...

The importance
of getting the information

out to those still alive
within the quarantine...

But it's given us a chance.

If you can get to a colder area,

to higher ground,
they move slower on the ground.

The Battle of Moscow is still raging.

lnitial tests on the so-called camouflage
have been largely successful.

Others have found a way to push back.

Move, movei All right, juice 'em upi

Approaching target.
Permission to engage.

Permission granted.

All clear. Light 'em up. Light 'em up.

It's permanent!

It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!

There's no forgiveness in hell!

Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!

This is Station 7 in Nebraska,
broadcasting on the shortwave band.

If you can fight, fight.

Head north if you can.

Hello?
ls there anyone out there hearing this?

Help each other.

Mexico City has been
declared a complete loss.

Be prepared for anything.

Our war has just begun.
