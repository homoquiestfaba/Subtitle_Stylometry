Sir Arthur, what are you doing?
Going to the theatre.

No, it is not possible.
I have no choice!

You must get back...
Louis!

Hot coffee, very strong, please.
{y:i}- D'accord.

Louis! "Schnell", please!
Don't move.

{y:i}Clothilde, encore du café. Vite.

{y:i}Sir Arthur, la tasse, s'il vous plaît.

{y:i}- Bonne chance, Sir Arthur.
{y:i}- Merci.

{y:i}Nicht so schnell.

{y:i}Louis, ich muss das allein tun.

I'll be fine. Now go and fetch the cab.

Canton.
Good evening, sir.

Arthur!

Arthur, is this wise?
No, it's foolish.

Do you intend to go on?
Yes, Helen. I've never missed one yet.

I'll let everybody know.

Here, take a drink.
Thank you.

Oh, that's better, Frank.

Your gloves, sir.
Very good, Louis.

This "is" a surprise, sir.

# As up we string the faithless king

# In the old familiar way

# We'll shout ha ha! Hip hip hurrah!

# Hip hip hip hip hurrah!

# As we make an end of her false papa!

# Hurrah! Hurrah!

Permission, Mr Cook.
Permission, Shrimp.

Come!

Five minutes, Mr Grossmith.

# If you give me your attention
I will tell you what I am

# I'm a genuine philanthropist

# All other kinds are sham

# Each little fault of temper

# And each social defect

# In my erring fellow creatures

# I endeavour to correct

# To all their little weaknesses

# I open people's eyes

# And little plans to snub
the self-sufficient I devise

# I love my fellow creatures

# I do all the good I can

# Yet everybody says
I'm such a disagreeable man

# And I can't think why

# I'm sure I'm no ascetic

# I'm as pleasant as can be

# You'll always find me ready
with a crushing repartee

# I've an irritating chuckle,
I've a celebrated sneer

# I've an entertaining snigger

# I've a fascinating leer

# To everybody's prejudice
I know a thing or two

# I can tell a woman's age
in half a minute - and I do

# But although I try to make myself

# As pleasant as I can

# Yet everybody says
I am a disagreeable man

# And I can't think why

# He can't think why

# I can't think

# Why

{y:i}- Monsieur.
{y:i}- Bonsoir.

{y:i}- Vous avez lá un succés certain.
{y:i}- Merci.

What do you expect me to do?
Kiss the carpenters?

Arthur!

Let's get him up.

Come on, sir.

Arthur, take some brandy.

What happened? What happened?!

Is Doctor Lynch in the house?

Listen to this! Today's "Times".

"'Princess Ida' will
probably run for a year...

...keeping the Savoy treasury
agreeably replete all the while."

"All London will flock to hear it."

"So will our provincial,
American and continental visitors."

"Copies of its words and music
will be sold by tens of thousands."

"Everybody connected with it will have
a good time for at least twelve months."

"So mote it be."

How splendid, Willie!
Sugared words, Lucy.

Listen.

"The opera is above the level of all
other entertainments before the public."

"Still, I cannot pronounce it
to be in any way...

...an improvement upon its predecessors."

"To me, words and music alike reveal...

...symptoms of fatigue in their
respective composer and author."

"Arthur Sullivan cannot write
other than in pleasing manner...

...but several numbers in 'Princess Ida'
lack the freshness and spontaneity...

...of 'The Pirates of Penzance',
'Patience, lolanthe'...

...or 'The Sorcerer', his best operatic work."

Oh! Is it?

"Or 'HMS Pinafore', the most popular."

"WS Gilbert abundantly proves
he is still the legitimate monarch...

...of the realm of Topsy-Turvydom."

Thank you very much(!)

"But his incongruities are more
elaborately worked up than of yore...

...and therefore less funny."

"Moreover, the story is a dull one!"

Burn it, Pidgeon!
Sir.

Willie...!

Your kidneys are getting cold!

The show's doing splendidly.
Full houses and a healthy advance.

Capital.
Three tours on the road.

{y:i}Pirates, Patience and lolanthe.

And four in rehearsal.
{y:i}- Merveilleux.

New York can't wait for "Ida".

Ah, New York. How splendid.

Helen has us booked up to year's end.
Tireless as ever.

All part of my day's work.

Tea, Miss Lenoir?
No, thank you, Louis.

Very well.

I hope your confinement
hasn't made you restless.

How have you been passing the time?

I've made some resolutions, Helen.

A little late in the new year, perhaps.
Better late than never.

May we know what they are, Arthur?

Why not?

One.

To travel to the Continent
as soon as my health permits.

Very wise.
I think so.

Two.

To look for a country house
where I may repair each summer...

...without having to cross the Channel.

Three. To take more exercise.
Excellent, Arthur. About time, too.

A leaf out of your book, D'Oyly.
I must walk more.

And is there a number four?

Yes.

To write no more operas for the Savoy.

And what is number five?
To fly to the moon in his bed socks!

No, I'm serious.
I have to write a grand opera.

People expect it of me.
I must not disappoint them.

I cannot waste any more time
on these trivial soufflés.

Do you know I haven't written
a symphony for over 20 years?

Not an unprofitable 20 years,
if I may say so.

Arthur.

If you would learn to organise
your time more efficiently...

...you could do everything you wished.

My time is finite, Helen. I must fill it
with that which is important to me.

Is not the Savoy Theatre
important to you?

This work with Gilbert
is quite simply killing me.

Working with Gilbert would kill anybody.

Is your contract with D'Oyly
and Mr Gilbert not important to you?

But our present concern is your health.

You must go to the South of France
and recover.

We can discuss this on your return.

I shall recover, D'Oyly.

And I shall return.

But there will be nothing to discuss.

Did you dine at the Beefsteak Club?

Yes. Somewhat unsatisfactory.

Oh.

Well, you missed Mrs Judd's rabbit curry.

One gets the impression that everyone
is snickering behind one's back.

Perhaps you could have some
for tomorrow's lunch.

The king of Topsy-Turvydom.

Humiliating.

You look a little uncomfortable.

I'm comfortable enough.

I watched a bit from the wings.

Oh, did you?
The first act.

Seemed to be going well, surprisingly.

There! You see?

Would you like me to read to you?

No, thank you. I'll leave you.

You must be tired.

No, I'm not in the slightest.

Wrong of me to unburden myself on you.

Don't be silly. That's why I'm here.

Come and talk to your Kitty.

Sometimes one wonders
why one bothers.

They say jump... you jump.

Good night, my dear.
Good night.

Lady Colin is endeavouring
to persuade us to take up smoking.

She's writing an article for
{y:i}The Saturday Review.

She proposes that nicotine
is a gift from the gods...

...and if men may benefit
from its soothing qualities...

...why, then, may women not also?

My poor daughter now believes that...

...smoking is an extension
of the communion...

...between a woman and her husband.

Will she smoke on her wedding day?

Heaven forfend!

Lady Colin is... irresistible.

She cannot conceive
why the Irish are starving...

...when there's
"lots of good fish in the sea".

She most probably has a point.

Oh, there's good news from Dublin.
Mmm?

The Churchills "are" to return to London.

Forgiven, but not forgotten.

I do hope so.

Jenny says Winston is 11,
covered in freckles...

...and has a total disdain for authority.

Mmm.

I shall miss this fragrance.

Sicilian lemons.

Have you chosen your Beethoven
for the Philharmonic Society?

As a matter of fact, I have.

Yes.

No.2?
The Seventh.

Ah.
More dramatic.

And that is to be your work
whilst you're away?

That... and only that.

Will there be room for Mr Gilbert
in your baggage?

Certainly not. He's far too large.

Food for thought.

{y:i}Ce n'est pas á moi de dire.

Indeed not.

Which train will you catch?

The tidal train.

Up at seven.

{y:i}Arriver á Paris á 3:30?

{y:i}Á peu prés.

How will you spend
your first night of liberty?

I shall take some exercise.

Hmm!

{y:i}La poupée de Paris, alors!

{y:i}# Les oiseaux

{y:i}# Dans la charmille

{y:i}C'est émouvant!

Whoo!

{y:i}Allez, battez!

{y:i}C'est mes cuisses!

{y:i}Plus de cuisses!

Whoo!

{y:i}Comment vous appelez-vous?

{y:i}Voilá Mademoiselle Fromage, monsieur.

{y:i}Oui, c'est vrai.

{y:i}Quelle sorte de fromage?

{y:i}Peut-ìtre un fromage suisse?

{y:i}Oui, oui!

{y:i}Avec des petits trous?

{y:i}Si je peux vous embrasser...

{y:i}Et vous aussi.

My voice.
My voice - I've strained my voice.

I've been trying too hard.

The smaller the house,
the greater the effort.

I'm very cross with myself.
I should know better.

One's knocking one's pipes out
in a vain attempt to elicit a response...

...from three colonial bishops, two elderly
ladies and an intoxicated costermonger!

They're roasting in their own lard,
like the Christmas goose.

And the costermonger left at the interval.

Did he?
Mm.

Ha! A man of infinite taste. Clearly!

Will you take a wee gargle
of my salt water?

No, thank you.
It would put me in mind of my boyhood.

Mm. Do forgive me.

Not at all.

I fear that dear Mr Gilbert
has run out of ideas.

No.
He doesn't know what to do with me!

Ponder this.

He thrusts me into
tight-fitting pots and pails...

...and poaches me
like a fucking haddock!

Forgive my Anglo-Saxon, Mr Butt.
Have a biscuit.

Thank you, sir.
I'll take one 'ome with me for me supper.

Dickie, it's just this heat.

It addles the noodles.
It happened to me in Milan frequently.

{y:i}Ah, Milano. Bellissimo.

The heat less hellish.

I am humiliated.

One might as well be in the chorus.

Away wi' you, you wee monkey!

Alas, no!

The reign of the Emperor Gilbert
is all but at an end.

I consider this to be his best piece so far.

With all due respect, Durward,
your romantic opinion may be informed...

...by the fact that you take a rather good
role, in which you are "trés splendide".

{y:i}- Mm, grazie.
{y:i}- Prego.

But I consider "Princess Ida"
to be their worst.

Do you?
I do.

Where is the panache of "Pirates"?

The wit of the "Pinafore"?

From such a face and form as mine...

...the noblest sentiments...

...sound like the black utterances...

...of a depraved imagination.

It was very good, you know.

Yes, Dickie.
Do forgive me, dear boy.

I don't wish to be the prophet of doom.

But one has the distinct feeling...

...that the sword of Damocles hovers
ominously over the Savoy Theatre.

How was Temple?

Oh. Rather disgruntled, I fear.

As though he wasn't
quite enjoying himself.

His heart wasn't in it.

No. One can usually rely
on Mr Temple, can't one?

Mmm.

And the ladies' chorus look as though
they could all do with a hearty meal.

It's this infernal heat.

One still has to feed oneself, Willie,
whatever the weather.

And the audience
were fanning themselves...

...with their programmes and libretti.

Most distracting when one is striving
to concentrate on the performance...

...to have in the corner of one's eye
this confounded flapping!

Makes one want to stand up and shout!

I trust you restrained yourself.
Of course I did, Willie.

More tea, ma'am?
No, thank you, Pidgeon.

Coffee, sir?
Yes.

Pidgeon. Did my father say anything else?

Nothing I should care to repeat, sir.

There were more people
on the stage than in the audience.

Did you count them?

No, of course I didn't.
Then how do you know?

I was speaking metaphorically.

You were exaggerating.

Anything else, sir?
No, thank you.

Oh, horror!

Horror!

Horror!

Willie.

Come in.

Good morning, my dear.
Good morning, Richard.

Another scorcher.
The everlasting bonfire.

Good morning, guv'nor.
Morning, Barker.

Thank you.

Shocking.
Most alarming.

A mediocre evening.

Three fainters.
In the audience?

I fear so. All women.

Any absentees?
Four chorus members.

With doctors' notes?
Yes.

And... how are the returns?

Oh, good grief!
It's an improvement on Monday.

Seven dead horses
in the Strand this morning...

Well, one down by Trafalgar Square.

How can you sit there
in your hat and coat, Barker?

I'm too hot to remove them, Mr Carte.

This is developing into a crisis.
Indeed it is.

A man has a family to support.
I fear we shall all have to "pray" for rain.

If it's any consolation,
every theatre in town is afflicted.

Even the Gaiety, graced as it is with...

...Madame Bernhardt's
execrable Lady Macbeth. 38 per cent.

Who told you that, Barker?
Hollingshead.

I played a game of cricket
with him this morning at Coram's Fields.

In this heat?
Er, yes, madam, but not in this attire.

Good.

Mr Hollingshead told you a fib, Barker.
Indeed?

He's only playing to 29 per cent.

Mr Hollingshead has no need
to lie to "me", Mr Carte.

Mr Hollingshead has much need
to lie to everybody, Mr Barker.

Especially you.
Gentlemen...!

Are you there?

Yes.

8505.

Hello!

Is that you, Mr Gilbert?
Hello!

Hello?
Good morning, Barker.

This is Barker speaking!

Gilbert here!
{y:i}- Good morning, Mr Gilbert.

How are we today, Barker?

Are we popular, or are we mad?

Er... We are popular!

{y:i}Very good. Carry on.

Here is your message for today!

U, U, plus ten shillings and sixpence!

Can you repeat that, please?!
Yes.

U... U!

So that's U for udder...

...U for udder,
plus ten shillings and sixpence.

So you have two udders, Barker!

Er... yes.
I always suspected as much!

{y:i}- Thank you.
Thank you!

Goodbye!
Goodbye, Mr Gilbert!

I'm going to hang up the telephone now!

In... Indeed you are, sir.

Well, I'm, er... going out to seek
a little Italian hokey-pokey...

...and I care not who knows it.
Thank you, Barker.

I shall not return with any for you, sir,
because it would melt.

{y:i}Au revoir.

I owe you an apology, Kitty.
I fear you weren't exaggerating after all.

Apology accepted. Thank you, Willie.

Schwenck speaks to the Savoy
every morning in code, Father-in-law...

...just in case the telephone operator
should be eavesdropping.

One might as well open the window
and shout down the street.

That will be more comfortable for you.
Sheer waste of time.

It will only result in the further erosion
of the written word.

Would you care to sit down now?

Er... er... thank you.

Ah, there you are, Pidgeon.
Ma'am.

I do apologise, sir,
that neither I nor Schwenck was here...

...to welcome you
on your arrival last night.

I do not appreciate being left
upon the doorstep like a hawker.

If you'll only press the electric bell,
Father, you'll be admitted at once.

Is that not so, Pidgeon?
Indeed it is, sir.

I have no intention
of placing my life in danger, sir!

How many doorstep deaths
have we had thus far, Pidgeon?

Er, none to my certain knowledge, sir.

There you are, Father.
The odds appear to be in your favour.

Anything else, sir?
No, thank you.

Would you tell Mrs Judd
Dr Gilbert will join us for lunch?

Certainly, ma'am.

You know, Father-in-law,
that you are most welcome in our home...

...at any time.

But, please, do try to inform us
of your intention to visit.

A father should not have
to seek permission...

...to visit his own son!

The son shouldn't be expected
to be clairvoyant!

Who does he think I am? Harlequin?

Would you excuse me?

I take it that you will be joining
us for lunch, Father-in-law?

I-I have no idea where
I shall be taking luncheon...

...thank you.

Well, perhaps Schwenck
can persuade you.

Take lunch with us, Father.

We shall enjoy your company.

Am I to understand, sir...

...that you have been
in communication with your mother?

No, Father, not for some
considerable time, I'm glad to say.

You are a liar, sir.

No, sir!

I can assure you, Papa,
that the last person...

...with whom I wish
to have any communication...

...is your estranged wife!

The vicious woman who bore me
into this ridiculous world!

How dare you, sir! Have you no respect?

Don't misunderstand me, Father.

Nobody respects her more than I do,
and I can't stand her.

She is a veritable gorgon!

She is indeed!
And she has chosen her own path.

And in so doing, she has turned
her back on yourself and myself.

And for that small mercy,
we should both of us be eternally grateful.

Those terrors...

...that visit me in the night.

They can never be vanquished.

Ah! Insomnia. I suffer from it myself.

But it is she who sends them.

I know it is she!

I know not what heathen oracle
she consults...

...what filthy familiar she employs.

I know that... they will come.

Wh... Wh... What are these walls?

£5,000?

The last ten shares. Worth every penny.

Trust me, Arthur.

I do, D'Oyly.

What's this?
Pull it.

It's a reservoir pen. It contains its own ink.

Good gracious me!
Whatever will they think of next?

Try it.

Now, how long is all this going to take?

Two years.

I shall begin the foundations next month.

Thank you.

To the Savoy Hotel.

The Savoy Hotel.

With its 70 bathrooms.

The builder was much bemused.

"What's the point of 'aving a bathroom
to every bedroom?"

"Who's gonna be staying there?
Amphibians?"

D'Oyly, I can't tell you how delightful
it is to see you here in Paris.

You're looking much better.
A new man!

Monte Carlo was most profitable.

Florence was hideously hot.
I sampled the chartreuse at Certosa.

The monks were uncommonly charming.

The train journey through
the St Gotthard Pass is spectacular.

You must go. And Lucerne...

Tranquillity itself.

I walked until I dropped.

Did you receive my letter?

Yes, I did.

Good.

And?

It came to Brussels.

I "sent" it to Brussels, Arthur.

Yes, of course.

{y:i}Nous sommes prìts.

{y:i}Vouz avez tué ce pigeon vous-mìme?

{y:i}Non, monsieur.
{y:i}Je laisse au bourreau le soin de le faire.

{y:i}C'est mieux comme ça.

So, what is your position?

Much the same, I'm afraid.

I fully realise, D'Oyly,
that you have me under contract.

But I cannot write
any more operas for the Savoy.

At least, not of that particular character.

I think you should tell Gilbert.

I shall. The moment I return.

{y:i}Messieurs...

{y:i}... je vous souhaite bon appétit.

{y:i}- Merci.
{y:i}- Merci.

# The reason is not far to find

# When we are near

# For though they say that love is blind

# Ah, never fear

# Ah, ah, ah

# We see our destinies entwined

# In noonday clear

# And love is over all

# When shadows fall

# And thou art

# Here

{y:i}- Il est bien, Clothilde.
"Oui, madame." You are a tonic for him.

"Merci." Cherish him.

Of course, "madame".

Oh! Mrs Ronalds.
What an unexpected pleasure.

Mr Gilbert, how are you?
How are you?

Quite well.
I'm so pleased.

He's in excellent spirits.
I look forward to his tales.

Good day.
Good day to you.

{y:i}- Au revoir.
{y:i}- Madame.

{y:i}- Ça va, Clothilde?
{y:i}- Ça va, monsieur?

It is hot, no?
Yes.

He awaits.
Thank you.

How was your crossing, Sullivan?

Mercifully smooth, thank you.

As smooth as D'Oyly Carte?

No, not quite, Gilbert!

Lump sugar?
Thank you, no.

Oh, please do. I found it in Lucerne.
It's delicious.

If you insist.

Mmm! Very good.
Good.

Is Lucy well?
Oh, she's in fine fettle.

She sends you her love
and trusts you are in good health.

Thank you. Please reciprocate.

Oh, of course.

Now, what's this Carte's been telling me?

Oh, dear.

You can't be serious.
I'm afraid I am.

So you've torn up our contract into tiny
pieces and cast it to the four winds?

Don't be absurd!
That would be the implication.

I hardly think so.

What else is one to deduce?

Oh, Gilbert.

There's so much that I have
yet to do for music...

...for my queen, for my country.

Even if God were to grant me two days
for every one I have left on this earth...

...I still should not be able
to achieve everything.

Come, come, Sullivan, you're a genius.

I merely bask in your reflected glory.

Oh, Gilbert, please.

But I'm somewhat at a loss. What is
the precise nature of your dilemma?

How shall I put this?

My tunes, my orchestrations,
are becoming repetitious.

I've rung all the changes possible
in the way of variety of rhythm.

I have such respect for your words...

...that I have continually kept down
my music in order that they can be heard.

It's no more than word-setting.

Sullivan, I have always
subordinated my words to your music.

Oh, I think not.

You've often expatiated
on the thorough good feeling...

...with which we've worked together.
Unquestionably.

But I want a chance for my music
to act in its own proper sphere.

It does. It always has and it always will.

It must be allowed to intensify the
emotional depth not only of your words...

...but of the situation, which can
be humorous, dramatic... What you will.

Of course. It goes without saying.

You teach me the ABC of my profession.

Now. Would you care for me
to read this to you or not?

Where is it set?
In the Sicilian mountains.

Plenty of scope there for Gypsy music,
one might suggest.

Now, the local alchemist
is killed in an explosion...

...and there, amongst his effects,
a chorus of villagers discover a potion.

Magic, no doubt.
Indeed.

I thought as much.

The effect of this magic potion is
to transform the character who takes it...

...into whatever he or she
is pretending to be.

You and your world of Topsy-Turvydom!

In 1881, it was a magic coin.

And before that, it was a magic lozenge.

And in 1877, it was an elixir.

In this instance, it is a magic potion.

"Act One. Scene:

...a mountain inn
on a picturesque Sicilian pass."

"A range of mountains
with Etna in the distance."

I've made you some beef tea, Mr Gilbert.
Take it away.

You've not had anything
since yesterday afternoon, sir.

Take it away.
You can't work on an empty stomach.

Can't work at all, Mrs Judd,
if I'm being constantly pestered...

...by interfering women with hot beef tea,
cold compresses, mustard poultices...

...and excessive attacks
of philanthropic zeal.

How's my wounded soldier?
He's not doing as he's told, madam.

Oh, isn't he now?

Willie, are you intending
to visit the dentist tomorrow?

You really...
Oh, for God's sake! You pair of harpies!

Get out! I'm working!

Willie.
Madam...

I had rather spend an afternoon
in a Turkish bath with my mother...

...than visit the dratted dentist.

Very well.

Good night!

She's being just a little bit tricky.

She's coming.

Well done, Mr Gilbert!

Rinse.

She's a beauty.

Open wide.
Wh... What?

Bite... really hard.

I must say, my wife and I
did find "Princess Ida"...

...rather too long, don't you know.

Try not to speak, old chap.

I do hope you've enjoyed your evening...

...but before we say farewell,
may I suggest an impromptu?

Mr Walter Simmonds
has generously offered...

...to accompany me on the harmonium!

Now, we have another very young
hopeful with us this evening...

...who has kindly agreed to accompany us
with a new composition of his own.

{y:i}The Lost Chord!

Sir Arthur informed me
a few moments ago...

...that he cannot entirely
recall his new piece.

{y:i}- Merci, madame.

# Seated one day at the organ

# I was weary and ill at ease

# And my fingers wandered idly

# Over the noisy keys

# I know not what I was playing

# Or what I was dreaming then

# But I struck one chord of music

# Like the sound of a great amen

# Like the sound

# Of a great amen

It's ridiculous.

It is. I sent him the thing
on Monday of last week.

He could have read it on the same day.
At the very least on Tuesday.

Now ten days have passed
and not a word.

This concerns me greatly.
It concerns "me" greatly.

You'll have to go and see him.
I'll be buggered if I do any such thing!

I present the man with my idea,
he rejects it...

...I respond in detail to his misgivings
but answer came there none.

Either he hasn't read it,
or he has read it and he doesn't like it.

If he doesn't, he should say so.
At least we shall know where we stand.

Go and see him.
No, Carte! You go and see him.

I've no more shots in my locker.

Sullivan & Gilbert! Who are they?

At least we're going to
revive "The Sorcerer".

Only as a stopgap.

It's breathing space.
It won't run more than three months.

Your unbounded optimism
is inspiring, Carte.

I have great confidence in "The Sorcerer",
but I'm not in the business of revivals.

You are now. Since you've decided
to withdraw the ailing "Princess Ida"...

...in spite of the cooler weather.

How many today, Jessie?
Only nine, alas!

"Oh, alas!"

I have received none today.

I'm utterly neglected.

Have these, you poor soul!

I don't want your scraps, Jessie Bond.

Too vigorous, Emily. Apply the bandage.

Beg your pardon, Miss Bond.

Shall I ever find anybody again?
Don't be so gloomy, Leonora.

Sadly, I seem to appeal
only to elderly gentlemen.

Where are my young bucks and blades?
{y:i}Quel dommage!

I've told you what you must do.

The last thing a girl wants
after an evening's performance...

...is to have to go and sing
all night for London society.

Idle ladies and their odious husbands.

One has to sing for one's supper.

It's damned exhausting. I detest it.

Anyway, they're not all married.

And some of them
are rather cute and courteous.

You have them dangling
on a leash, Jessie.

One must keep oneself amused,
don't you know?

So terribly trying.

When I meet a gentleman,
he invites me to supper.

I mention my little... secret...

...and then he's off, quick smart.

{y:i}C'est impossible!

You shouldn't reveal your secret...

...until he's fallen in love
with you and has proposed!

Oh, Jessie, for goodness' sake!

By the by, "monsieur",
you do realise I have a little boy?

I couldn't possibly pretend
that Stanton doesn't exist. No.

No, he's my precious little bundle.

How's his toothache?
Earache.

He suffers terribly, poor mite.

Shall I lace you up now, Miss Bond?
Of course, Emily.

Surely your Mr Barnes would be willing?

Mr Baker. Jessie, please!

I do not intend
to become a widow again before I'm 50.

No. Neither do I.

# No doubt, yet spite of all your pains

# The interesting fact remains

Come in.

#... a little boy

# He was a little boy

Five minutes, Miss Braham.

Thank you, Shrimp.
Pleasure, miss.

# But soft, they waken one by one

# The spell has worked

# The deed is done

# I would suggest that we retire

# While Love, the housemaid

# Lights her kitchen fire

# While Love, the housemaid

# Lights her kitchen fire

# Why

# Where be oi

# And what be oi a-doin'

# A-sleepin' out just when

# The dew do rise?

# Why, that's the very way
your 'ealth to ruin

# And don't seem
quite respectable likewise

# 'Ey, that's you

# Only think of that now

# What may you be at now?

# Tell me do

# 'Ey, what a nose

# And oh, what eyes, miss

# Lips like a rose

# And cheeks likewise, miss

# Oi'll tell you true

# Which I never done, sir

# Oi like you

# As oi never liked none, sir.

# 'Ey, but I do

# Like you

Morning, Carte.
Good morning, Gilbert.

Cigar?
Thank you.

Gilbert.
Sullivan. May I?

Certainly.
Morning, D'Oyly.

Good morning, Miss Lenoir.
Good morning.

Good day, Helen.

Now, gentlemen.
We all know why we're here.

We seem to have come
to something of a standstill.

Indeed we have.
Which, Arthur, is because...

Oh.

Because, Helen...

...I am unable to set the piece
that Gilbert persists in presenting.

The piece I persist in presenting
is substantially altered each time.

Otherwise there'd be little point
in my presenting it to you.

With respect, old chap,
it is not substantially altered at all.

You seem merely to have grafted
on to the first act...

...the tantalising suggestion
that we are to be in the realms of...

...human emotion and probability...

...only to disappoint us by reverting to
your familiar world of Topsy-Turvydom.

That which I have grafted on to Act One,
Sullivan, has been at your request.

But if you take exception
to Topsy-Turvydom...

...you take exception to a great deal
of my work of the past 25 years.

Not to mention much of what you and I
have written together since 1871.

That is patent balderdash!
Is it?

Gentlemen, if we might keep things
cordial, we may make some progress.

Arthur, can you really not see
your way to setting this new piece?

Alas, Helen, I cannot.
Cannot or will not?

I am truly unable to set any piece
that is so profoundly uncongenial to me.

Uncongenial though it may be to you...

...I must remind you that we here
are conducting a business.

May I remind you, Helen,
that I am not a machine.

I would not suggest for one moment
that you were.

You all seem to be treating me
as a barrel organ.

You have but to turn my handle...

...and out pops a tune!
That's not strictly true.

Arthur.
Come now, that's unfair.

You are both contractually obliged
to supply a new work on request.

The very act of signing a joint contract
dictates that we must be businesslike.

Yes, Mr Gilbert.

And I was wondering whether "you" might
be able to solve our wee difficulty.

How, pray?
By simply writing another libretto.

It's out of the question. I have worked
for many long months at this play...

...which I have every confidence will be
the best we have produced at the Savoy.

To abandon it would be
both criminal and wasteful.

I see.

Had the complaint been lodged earlier,
that might have been different.

I did so when you presented the libretto.

I was unable to present you
with the libretto...

...until you returned from your grand tour!

That is neither here nor there.
No, Sullivan. Indeed.

I was here and you were there. Ha!

What I don't understand, Arthur...

...is why you cannot set this piece.

You're our greatest composer.
Surely you can do anything?

How very kind you are, Helen.

But I say again to you all,
I am at the end of my tether.

I have been repeating myself in this...
class of work for too long...

...and I will not continue so to do.

Neither of us runs any risk
of repeating himself.

This is an entirely new story,
quite unlike any other.

It's markedly similar to "The Sorcerer".

People say we're repeating ourselves.

How is it similar to "The Sorcerer"?

Obviously both involve characters...

...who are transformed
by the taking of a magic potion.

A device which I continue to find
utterly contrived.

Every theatrical performance is
a contrivance by its very nature.

Yes, but this piece consists entirely
of an artificial and implausible situation.

If you wish to write a grand opera
about a prostitute...

...dying of consumption in a garret...

...I suggest you contact Mr lbsen in Oslo.

I'm sure he can furnish you
with something suitably dull.

Gilbert, please.
Hmm?

I do beg your pardon, Miss Lenoir.

Oh, no. Granted.

The opportunity to treat a situation
of tender, human and dramatic interest...

...is one I long for
more than anything else in the world.

If that is your sincere desire, I would
be willing, with Carte's permission...

...to withdraw my services
whilst you write a grand opera...

...with a collaborator
with whom you have more affinity.

No, Gilbert.
I'm in earnest, Sullivan.

No doubt we shall be pursuing that
in the future.

Indeed.

Well, that is your prerogative, Carte.

However, we are concerned
with the present.

Arthur. Will you or will you not set
Mr Gilbert's new and original work?

{y:i}Ma belle Héléne: Ce n'est pas possible.

Truly?

I'm afraid so.

That being the case... Mr Gilbert...

Am I right to suppose that
you remain unable to accommodate us?

Indeed, Miss Lenoir.

I have had what I deem
to be a good idea...

...and such ideas are not three a penny.

What a pity.

This will be a very sad day
for many thousands of people.

Well, gentlemen, I don't know about you...

...but speaking for myself,
I could murder a pork chop.

If you'll excuse me, I shall retrieve my hat.

Gilbert.
Sullivan.

Good day to you both.

No doubt we shall be in communication
in the near future.

Good day, Mr Gilbert.
Good day.

You know where to find me.

Arthur.

Where have you been?
Shopping.

Surprising(!)

I was in Knightsbridge...
and guess what I saw?

An elephant gilding two lilies.

No.
I have no idea.

Three tiny Japanese ladies!

How do you know they were Japanese?
They had on their funny dressing gowns.

Had they just got up?

No, there's a Japanese exhibition
at Humphreys' Hall.

Oh, yes. Japanese village of some sort.

Yes! Yes, sounds rather intriguing.
Might we visit?

No.
But the whole of London will be going!

Precisely!
Don't be so stubborn!

I have other things on my mind,
you know that!

Yes, I do know that and I understand...

...but a little distraction will do you good.

Kitty, I don't want to be distracted.
Yes, you do.

Oh, do I? You know my mind
better than I do, do you?

I know you better than you think I do.

Lucy, if you wish to visit Humphreys' Hall,
by all means do so...

...but I shall not accompany you
for all the tea in China.

What are you writing, sir?

Good afternoon, Lucy.
Maude!

Good heavens! What are you doing here?

How are you, Schwenck?
How jolly! You must join us.

Unfortunately, we're about to leave.

Oh, what a pity.
What do you make of it all?

It's entrancing.
It's frightful.

How's Mother?
Quite well.

She's in bed.

Come along, Maude.

We mustn't keep you. Good day to you.
Give her my best.

Of course.

Well... "au revoir".
Good day, Maude.

{y:i}Au revoir.

My goodness!
Mmm.

Perfectly green.

Spinach water.
Oh, Willie!

Thank you very much.

Shikuspen, prease.

I beg your pardon?
Shikuspen, prease.

She speaks English!
What did she say?

She said, "Sixpence, please"!

Shikuspence, prease.
Oh, sixpence!

Thank you very much.
{y:i}- Arigato gozaimasu.

Shixpence, prease.

Here we are, sir.

There, Pidgeon.
Very good, sir.

{y:i}Comme ça.

Yes, sir.

Show it to me.

To your right.

More... Good. Down a bit.

Down a bit... There.

Mark it there.
Yes, sir.

Give it to me.
Thank you, sir.

That's a fine-looking instrument, sir.

Now, would that be Spanish or Italian?

Neither, Pidgeon.
Er, of course, sir.

Excellent! Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

Do we suppose that Lucy is... with child?

I beg your pardon, Mama?
Lucy.

Is she "enceinte"? With child?

Why ever would you think that?

One wouldn't have said she was sickly.

Although... she did ask after "you", Mama.

What did he say?

Who?
Schwenck!

He said nothing, Mama! Nothing!

Nothing! Absolutely nothing!

Your dear son said very little.

And what he did say,
I have already told you.

Now...

Do you care for this or not?

It is merely a piece of wood.

Very well. I shall keep it for my collection.

Maude!
Yes, Mama?

Never bear a humorous baby.

I shall endeavour not to, Mama.

"The Mikado, or the town of Titipu."

"Act One."

"Scene: Courtyard of
Ko-Ko's palace in Titipu."

"Japanese nobles discovered
standing and sitting...

...in attitudes suggested
by native drawings."

"Chorus: 'If you want to know who we are
We're gentlemen of Japan.'"

"'On many a vase and jar,
on many a screen and fan

we figure in lively paint,
our attitudes queer and quaint.'"

"'You're wrong if you think it ain't.'"

"'If you think we are worked by strings
like a Japanese marionette,

you don't understand these things -

it's simply Court etiquette.'"

"'Perhaps you suppose this throng
can't keep it up all day long.'"

"'If that's your idea, you're wrong.'"

"Enter Nanki-Poo, in great excitement."

"He carries a native guitar on his back
and a bundle of ballads in his hand."

"Recitative, Nanki-Poo."

"'Gentlemen, I pray you, tell me...

...where a lovely maiden dwelleth
named Yum-Yum, the ward of Ko-Ko.'"

"'In pity speak, oh, speak, I pray you.'"

"'I hurried back at once
in the hope of finding Yum-Yum...

...at liberty to listen to my protestations.'"

"Pish-Tush: 'It is true that Ko-Ko
was condemned to death for flirting...

...but he was reprieved
at the last moment...

...and raised to the exalted rank
of Lord High Executioner...

...under the following
remarkable circumstances.'"

"Song, Pish-Tush."

"'Our great Mikado, virtuous man,

When he to rule our land began

Resolved to try a plan whereby

Young men might best be steadied.'"

"'So he decreed in words succinct

That all who flirted, leered or winked

Unless connubially linked

Should forthwith be beheaded.'"

"'And I expect you'll all agree
That he was right to so decree.'"

"'And I am right, and you are right,

And all is right as right can be.'"

"'This stern decree, you'll understand,

Caused great dismay
throughout the land,

For young and old and shy and bold

Were equally affected.'"

"'The youth who winked a roving eye

Or breathed a non-connubial sigh

Was thereupon condemned to die.'"

"'He usually objected.'"

"'And you'll allow, as I expect,
That he was right to so object,

And I am right, and you are right

And everything is quite correct.'"

"'And so we straight let out on bail

A convict from the county jail

Whose head was next on some pretext,
Condemn-ed to be mown off,

And made him Headsman, for we said:

Who's next to be decapit-ed

Cannot cut off another's head
Until he's cut his own off.'"

"'And we are right, I think you'll say,
To argue in this kind of way,

And I am right, and you are right,

And all is right - too-loorallay!'"

"Chorus. End of song."

Highly amusing, Willie.

Fatuous.
Oh.

Surely Arthur likes it?

He hasn't said otherwise.

It certainly is rich
in human emotion and probability.

Hardly.

"Enter Pooh-Bah."

It's a tragedy.
It is.

{y:i}Che bruto.

Absolutely. He simply hasn't
played with a straight bat.

Who's that?
His Majesty the Mahdi.

Oh, yes.
No, it just isn't cricket.

Quite so. It's completely contrary
to the rules of engagement.

The man was surrounded on all sides
and massacred mercilessly.

"What full fortune
doth the thick lips owe."

What does that mean?
Philistine.

It baffles me that you're baffled,
Barrington.

The Hottentot in the desert
doesn't play cricket.

His natural habitation
being the jungly-bungly tree...

...he is as yet hardly able
to walk upright, don't you know?

We strive to bring them civilisation...

...and this is their gratitude.

Did you know that 56 families were
slaughtered on the Island of Skye?

Really? When was that?
In '82, I think.

And who perpetrated the outrage, pray?

Oh, merely the, er... English militia.
Extraordinary.

{y:i}Buon appetito.

Shall we indulge in another dozen?

I rather think we ought, don't you?
I think we might.

Would you care for a second fish, Lely?
No.

Or a veritable shoal, perhaps?

I've had an ample sufficiency,
thank you, my wee man.

I have an appointment
with Carte this afternoon.

At what hour?
Five o'clock.

Curious.
I shall be with him at half past four.

That's funny. I don't have
a meeting with him at four o'clock.

And it is my firm intention
to prise open his purse.

It will take a far stronger man
than you, Mr Barrington...

...to fulfil that Herculean labour.

What's "your" mission, Captain Grossmith?

Oh, there are certain little matters.

I should like to offer you
an increase in salary.

Oh? Indeed?
Indeed.

That's most benevolent of you.
It's no less than you deserve.

Thank you.
And by how much, might one enquire?

By 7 1/2 per cent.

Mm.

7 1/2.

Now, that would work out at, er...

£30 per week.
30! Mm.

I see. Well, £30 per week
wasn't quite the sum I had in mind...

...as I wended my weary way here.

Indeed?

That would be three productions
with a negligible increase.

I don't consider an increase
of two pounds per week...

...over 12 months negligible, George.

One might have thought
the name of George Grossmith...

...my not inconsiderable contribution...

...would have been
more favourably recognised.

You do receive considerably more
than anyone else.

Do I?
Mm.

We should be terribly sorry to lose you.

Gilbert has written you
a particularly fine part in the new piece.

Precisely! As one would expect.

However, I should judge an increase
of a paltry two pound per week...

...to be wholly unacceptable.

Not to mention mildly insulting,
if one may say so.

And what figure had you in mind,
Mr Grossmith?

Er...

Forgive me, I seem to have
lost my train of thought.

Are you unwell, George?

I fear I may have come over a bit queer.

Most embarrassing.
You must take a little brandy.

A little water clears us of this deed.

I blame Grossmith for this.

Only Grossmith?
Thank you, Helen.

Confounded glutton.

Are you feeling better?
I do beg your pardon.

This is awfully embarrassing.
Not at all, Rutty.

Now why don't we return
to the subject of your salary?

Oh, yes.

Well, I must declare that I'm rather
at a loss for words, D'Oyly.

Excuse me.

Oh, I do beg your pardon.

This is a bally nightmare, damn it!

I shall be in my dressing room!

The more I see of men,
the more I admire dogs.

I'm soon to have a meeting...

...concerning the cast for the next opera.
Yes, indeed.

I've heard a little rumour
that I might be playing the part...

...of a 14-year-old schoolgirl.
Somebody's been telling tales.

They have indeed, Mr Carte!

Mr Gilbert will be very angry.

With reference to your engagement
for the opera...

...I have a great concern
about your little weakness.

I'm a little shocked, Mr Carte.

I really do believe that my behaviour
this last year has been exemplary.

I'm pleased to say
your tendency has improved...

...but I am concerned about the future.

Yes.
You're perhaps suggesting, Mr Carte...

...that I shan't be performing
in the next production.

Yes, I'm afraid I am.

But the outcome of that, Leonora,
is in your own hands.

Sometimes, Mr Carte,
I can be a very silly young woman.

You have an extraordinary talent.

It saddens me beyond measure
to see someone throw it away.

I assure you, Mr Carte,
that I shall be in tiptop form.

I'm very pleased to hear that.

Much relieved.

Do we have an understanding?

Yes, we do, Mr Carte.

Good.

Chop chop, Butt! How long do we have?

Eight minutes, Mr Temple.
Oh, jolly good.

Shocking news from Khartoum.
Indeed.

Something will have to be done,
{y:i}tout de suite.

Absolutely.

Mrs Temple hit the nail on the head,
as per usual.

Oh? What did she say?

"The nation loses a hero,
but the family loses a loved one."

Ooh, how apt.
Perspicacious woman is Mrs Temple.

Hat!

Consider this, my dear Butt.

Is it not the inevitable fate
of the professional soldier...

...that he may perish in battle?
Indeed, sir.

But Dickie, have you heard
the "real" news of the day?

Yes, the Fenian bomb. Oh, dreadful.

No, Grossmith and Barrington.

What?
They're off tonight.

Both of them?
Yes.

Why?
Oysters.

We shared luncheon.
Did you swallow?

No. I had sole.
Off the bone?

Yes. It was rather succulent.
Wise man. Oysters can kill.

Unquestionably!

My aunt choked on a scallop
at Herne Bay.

Really?
Tragic.

Yes, they were away to see Carte.

Oh, really?
Mm.

Will you be lobbying?
No, I'll wait for my summons.

Quite right, dear boy.

One should not be rewarded
on one's ability...

...to ingratiate oneself
with the management.

Particularly when
the management have difficulty...

...locating the whereabouts
of the arse and the elbow!

Serves them both right.

Enter!

Five minutes, please, Mr Temple, Mr Lely.

Thank you, Shrimp!

to provide you with triplets.

Triplets, Sir Arthur, yes.

Apology.

Consequently,

Of course, Sir Arthur.

The new man's doing awfully well.
Quite splendid.

Breathe, Bovill, breathe!

It's "piano", Barrington, "piano".
I'll do my best.
