You know your problem? You're always
talking about X but thinking about Y.

You've gotta learn to talk about Y.
Forget about X. X is gonna take care of itself.

What are you talking about?
Just hear yourself.

Listen to what you're saying under what you
think you're saying: control, control, control.

When are you gonna realise nothing
can be controlled? We live in chaos.

lt's the central issue in everyone's life.

Mack, look around you. Everyone in
this parking lot is struggling for control.

And you know what it is they're trying
to control, each and every one of 'em?

Fear. They're trying to control their fear.

Thanks for the game, Davis.
You're my best friend. Let's talk tomorrow.

Good night, Mack.
Good night, Vanessa.

l have more to say about this.

Why is it, when someone's
successful in one field,...

..they think they know about everything?
Drive carefully.


(car horns)

( ''Lawyers, Guns and Money''
by Warren Zevon on radio)

 l went home with the waitress

 The way l always do

 How was l to know

 She was with the Russians, too?

 l was gambling in Havana

 l took a little risk

 Send lawyers, guns and money

 Dad, get me out of this

 l'm the innocent bystander

(switches radio off)

(yelling nearby)

,,to be heard on this subject,

Missiles can accomplish at a cheaper price,,,,

,,and with greater accuracy
and fewer casualties,,,,

,,the mission that a pilot was supposed
to carry out, and did in previous wars,

And the air force is very resistant to change,

Dad should be home soon.
The game just ended.

l thought you were studying for your exam.
l was. l had the game on the radio.

Oh, can you pick me up tomorrow at... 4.30?

4.30, behind the school? l thought
you were gonna get a ride occasionally.

l try. lt's just really hard to arrange
to leave at exactly the same time as someone.

lt's just really hard for me to arrange
my afternoon around picking you up.

l'm working at the senior centre tomorrow.
lf you can't do it, l can try to find a ride.

lt's kinda late, but...

Thanks. Mom, l think
you need to get organised.

( rap music)

 And l'm hidin' in Honduras

 Desperate man

 Send lawyers, guns and money

Fuck!
 The shit has hit the fan


God.

(car horn)

All right, all right!

(car fails to start)

God. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

Operator 349, What city, please?
Yeah. l need road service for...

..l don't know, let's say lnglewood.
(static)

Hello? God.

Damn!

Yeah, Buckingham.

But remember, it's about
a half a mile... west, l guess, of there.

Stay close to your vehicle, sir,
lt should be a 25-minute wait,

l understand but, see, if it takes that long,
l might be, like, dead.

Should l call the police? Can they help?

The police?

No, nothing's happened. Just get
the truck here as fast as you can.

Will do, sir,

( rap music)

Mayday, Mayday. We're going down.

(car stops)

Hey, man, you need some help here?
Nice car. This one of them new Jap cars?

Yeah.
Yeah, you need some help...

..or yeah, this is a Jap car?

Thanks, no. l've already called
for the tow truck and the police.

You called the police? What?

On that phone there
you called all those people?

Who else you call, your mama?

He been busy, man.
l see.

You know, this is a nice car, mister.
l could use me a car with a phone in it.

Maybe you want us to gi' you a ride.
You want ajump-start?

Yeah, man. How about ajump-start?


He nervous, y'all.
What you so nervous about, man?

Maybe he carryin', Jim.
Maybe he scared we gonna bust him.

Bust his ass.

Leave that man alone!

OK, Grandma. Whatever, baby.

Why don't you get outta the car, mister?

You want me to have Jimmy
take you outta there?

Or how about this? Do you ever
wanna get outta that car again?

What do you want?
You want my wallet? You want my watch?

lt's a shitty watch. You're welcome to it.
What l want is you get outta the car.

Come on! Let's get this shit over with!
Now, motherfucker.

Which one of you called for the truck?
Me. That was me.

This is it. ltjust sorta died on me here.

l'm the one that called.

Well, l guess it was you, huh?
Yeah.

Hey, man, we was doin' fine here.

ls it the battery?
Huh?

Were you stopped
and it wouldn't start again?

No, no. ltjust died on me.

We're gonna have to take it in.

You dissin' me, man?
You bet he is. You're sayin' it now.

That's right. That's what he's doin'.
ls that right? You dissin' me?

No, l'm not. Nothin' like it.

l'm doin' ajob here, fella.
This is how l make my living.

l just ride out there and do the job.

l want it to go as smooth as it can be.

l don't like it to be any harder
than it already is.

You wanna make sure you're in neutral
and the parking brake is off?

That's bullshit, man. He talkin' bullshit.

Yeah, man, what's goin' down?
This is fucked up.

Get in the truck. You'll ride up with me.

Are you the one l'm talkin' to?
Hey, we all decide what goes down.

So don't fly that shit.
Yeah, man, fuck you!

Am l talkin' to the right man?

That's what l thought.

Look, l gotta ask you a favour.

l gotta ask you to let me go my way here.

Now, this truck is my responsibility.

Now the car's hooked up to it,
l'm responsible for that, too.

Any shit comes down now, it's my ass.
You follow me?

Do you think l'm stupid? Just answer me
that first and then we can talk.

l don't know nothin' about you,
you don't know nothin' about me.

l don't know if you're stupid
or some kinda genius.

But l do know this: l gotta get outta here
and you got the gun.

So l'm askin' you a favour
for the second time.

Let me go my way here.

l'm gonna grant you that favour.

And l'm gonna expect you
to remember this if we ever meet again.

Yeah.
But first...

..you gotta answer one more thing for me,
and you gotta tell me the truth.

Are you askin' me a favour
as a sign of respect,...

..or are you askin' me a favour
cos l got the gun?

Man, the world ain't supposed
to work like this.

l mean, maybe you don't know that,
but this ain't the way it's supposed to be.

l'm supposed to be able to do my job
without asking you if l can.

That dude is supposed to be able to wait
with his car without you rippin' him off.

Everything's supposed to be
different than what it is.

So what's your answer?

You don't have the gun,
we ain't havin' this conversation.

That's what l thought. No gun, no respect.

That's why l always got the gun.

( rap music)

Thanks.

You saved my ass.

We both got lucky.
lt could have gone different.

What's goin' on in the world?

This neighbourhood has gone to shit.

This country has gone to shit.

My sister and her kids live near here.


Hey, listen, nobody's really interested
about your little motor trip,

We're talking about my upcoming surgery,
So, now, where was l?

So you gonna see the Grand Canyon?
Don't miss Yosemite,

If you go to the alligator farm outside
Tallahassee, tell lvar Woody says hey,

Hey, Ma.

Hey, baby. How you doin'?
l'm all right.

(mother) What time is it?
11.30.

What's up?
What's up?

Kelley's gonna be
in the Girl Scouts next year.

Yeah?

l have to get her a uniform.

l'm goin' to bed.

Sleep tight, baby.
Goodnight, Ma.

(TVin background)

,,far-fetched, There was more slow time
than showtime this season,

The Lakers were simply out of sync,

But a stifling defence
and the return of the running game,,,

,,has catapulted LA back into
serious contention now in the West,

They're now just a game and a haIf
back from the Blazers,

The Magic came out hot, as they were putting
up everything, Dennis Scott hit six straight,

Dunleavy wanted a time-out,
His team was down by ten,

Here's Earvin Johnson missing the lay-up,
Divac can't jam it back, Magic breaking out,

This is Sam Vincent of Orlando,
Three on one, The lceman,

Jerry Reynolds stuffiing over Teagle,
Matt Guokas has done a great job,

(phone rings)

Hello?
Hello?

Hi, guys,
Mack. What's wrong?

Nothing, l'm fiine, The car died on me,
(son) Where?

Down near the Forum,
Oh, shit,

Roberto.
On Manchester?

No, no. Like an idiot, l took a short cut
and got all turned around.

You've never been where l broke down.
(Roberto) Shit! Are you outta there now?

Yeah, l'm at a gas station.
(wife) Good,

You're lucky you got out with your life.

Roberto, could l talk?
See you tomorrow, Dad.

Good night, pal,

Do you want me to come and get you?
No, If they don't fiinish it, l'll take a cab,

l'll tell you all about my adventure
in the morning.

Adventure? Mack, what happened?
Are you all right?

l'm fine. Go to bed, honey.

l love you.
Love you, too,

Bye.


You can go swimmin' in the ocean every day
and be perfectly cool, you know.

Then one day, just one particular day,
you bump into the big shark.

The big shark don't hate you.
He's got no feelin' for you at all.

You look like food to him.
You don't hate a hamburger, do you?

Yeah.

Those boys back there,
they got nothin' to lose.

lf you just happen to be swimmin' along
and bump into 'em, well...

lt might not be worth worryin' about.
lt's like bein' in a plane crash.

Well, that's comforting.
l'm glad you brought that up.

There just seems to be
so many ways to buy it.

Particularly in this city.

l'm amazed at the end of each day
that anybody's alive.

Then other days l think
maybe people aren't so fragile.

Things have always been kind of brutal,
and people just keep on going.

You ever been to the Grand Canyon?

l always meant to go.
l was there.

Only takes about nine hours from here.
l know. We were planning to take my boy.

How old is he?
15.

15? Probably won't wanna go with you now.

Probably go with his friends and
his chick now. You've missed that boat.

What's his name?
Roberto.

Roberto.
After Roberto Clemente.

No shit?

Man, get yourself to the Grand Canyon.

Beautiful, huh?
lt's pretty, all right.

But that's not the thing of it.
You can sit right on the edge of it. l did that.

l did everything. l went down in it,
l stayed overnight there.

But the thing that got me was sitting
on the edge of that big old thing.

Those rocks. Man,
those cliffs and rocks, they're so old.

lt took so long for that thing to get
to look like that. And it ain't done, either.

lt happens right while
you're sitting there watchin' it.

lt's happenin' right now while
we're sitting here in this ugly town.

When you sit on the edge of that thing,
you just realise what ajoke we people are.

What big heads we got, thinkin' that
what we do is gonna matter all that much.

Thinkin' our time here
means diddly to those rocks.

lt's a split second we've been here,
the whole lot of us.

And one of us? That's a piece of time
too small to get a name.

You trying to cheer me up?
Yeah.

Those rocks were laughing at me, l could tell.

Me and my worries. lt was
real humorous to that Grand Canyon.

You know what l felt like? l felt like
a gnat that lands on the ass of a cow...

..that's chewing its cud next to the road
that you ride by on at 70 miles an hour.

That's small.
Yeah. lt's small.

My name is Mack.

Simon.

l said left! l told you left!

You scum-sucking pig!
Sorry, mister. l must've heard you wrong.

Get outta there, you piece of shit!

l told you not to move!

Where's the shot?
What shot?

You took out the shot.
Which shot is that?

The money shot. The bus driver's head.

The brains-on-the-window shot.
The viscera-on-the-visor shot.

We thought we'd show it to you without...
Put it back. Don't show me anything.

You don't need it.
You're not even giving it a chance.

How's the rear-view-mirror gag
supposed to work without it?

Am l the only one here
who respects the writing?

l gotta help these kids on the bus.

Right, the counsellor in training.

When l get back from camp, l'm gonna
practise driving every time we get in the car.

That gives me a month to relax.

Have a great time, pal.
You, too.

l'll write a lot.
Yeah.

15 seconds to tell me
all the mother stuff one more time.

Sunscreen, hat, allergy pills,
summer reading, floss.

Watch out for poison oak, Lyme ticks,...

..bears, dragons... pestilence.

Just be careful, OK?
Write if you need anything.

Mom, l'm going to camp, not the army.

l love you, sweetheart.
Me, too.

Be happy.

 He's leaving home, bye-bye

l gotta go. You OK?
Mm-hm.

OK. Call you later.
OK.

OK, Robby. You ready for an adventure?
Mm-hm.

We're gonna figure this town out,
you and me. Here we go.

You ride shotgun.
OK, Mommy.

Hey.
Fuck! You scared the shit out of me.

The Rolex.
What? The car? You want it? You got it.

(car alarm)

Asshole. l told you l wanted the watch.

The bleeding's under control.
Just barely.

What have we got here?
Gunshot wound to the thigh.

Bone, muscle and arterial damage.

ls he conscious?
ln and out. Looks like he's coming out now.

Severed the sartorius muscle, the anterior
gracilis and partial trauma to the rectus.

Femoral artery?

Jesus, what a mess.
Did the femurjust shatter?

See if it's even possible to save the leg here.

(baby crying)

(baby crying)

You have a soapy head. You do.

What's that?

Yes, l know, l know. OK.

There we go. Right here
where you can see everything.

Yum, yum, yum, yum.


Where's that toe?

Here it is. Look at this.

This is gonna look
very good on you, l can tell.

l know. Come here.

Upsy-daisy-doo. OK.

Who's up?
Mrs Flores and her three sons.

Then what?
At 4.30, Mr Duk.

Mr Duck?
Mr Duk.

Mr Daffy Duk?

You're awful.

That's why l can't stand you.

(phone rings)

(whispers) Hello?
(Mack) Honey?

Hi, Mack.
How you doin'?

(whispers) Good. l'm having a good day.
Why are you whispering?

Am l whispering? l guess l'm feeling quiet.
l'm sitting out back.

l talked to Davis,
How is he doing?

Terrible. Apparently the bullet
just tore the shit out of everything.

lt's gonna take a long time to recover,
and then he may have a limp.

That's awful.
l can barely hear you, honey,

l said that's awful.
Yeah,

Listen, do you still wanna go out tonight?
No, we can't. l don't feel like it.

l'll make something here.
l like the sound of that. l gotta go.

Mack, don't work late,
l won't.

Bye, baby.

Surprise, surprise.

Yes, yes.

How's my girl doing today?

Why aren't you...

..out on a date, beauty?

What's with school?

So?
Mm?

Come on, don't give me a hard time.
Dee, no one knows less about men than me.

You do all right.

OK, let me ask you one question first.
Do you like yourjob?

l know what you're gonna say.
You can kiss it goodbye.

lt never fails. l absolutely guarantee you
the thing ends with you losing yourjob.

And not because you're the missis now,
livin' in the big house.

l don't think that. l wouldn't even want that.
Give me a little credit, will you?

One thing l think is so great about him
is how devoted he is to his wife and kid.

You are so full of shit, you know that?

You may not even know, but you really are.

You're sayin' what they all say at first.

l've seen it many times, honey.

lf he is so devoted to his wife,
what's he doin' messin' around with you?

He hasn't done anything.
You told me you were holding hands today.

Big deal. l shouldn't even have told you.

You gotta tell somebody that shit.
That's how you know it's happening.

Otherwise it's too goddamn lonely.

We must be going about
this whole thing wrong or something.

What thing?
The love thing.

The touch thing.

Where there's somebody to touch you,
real nice and gentle.

lt doesn't have to be that gentle.
Whatever.

Jane, do you ever feel
like you're just this far...

..from being completely
hysterical 24 hours a day?

Half the people l know feel that way.

The lucky ones feel that way.

The rest of the people
are hysterical 24 hours a day.

Claire, l'm here.
Hi, Mack.

You forgot to bring in the mail.
There's something here from Carol.

Mack, come on up here.
l wanna show you something.

ls something wrong?

Whose is it?
She's beautiful, isn't she?

ls that the Wilson kid?

Who?
l don't know.

What do you mean?
l don't know who the parents are.

Come on, Claire. Don't make me guess.
Where did it come from?

So? What's the story?

l found her. l was jogging, and l heard this
crying, and l looked under these bushes...

Wait. Where was this?
On Carmelina, just around the corner.

l looked under the bushes and there she was.

When was this?
This morning.

This morning? What time?
Around 9.30, l guess.

What did the police say?
Mm?

My guess is the police did not say ''Mm?''

So l guess my next guess is
you haven't called the police.

Claire, it's possible this baby was kidnapped
and someone's been looking for it all day.

l don't think so. l could tell. But l listened
to the news. There wasn't a thing about it.

They may not have announced it, or
they're waiting to hear from the kidnappers.

This baby wasn't kidnapped,
l can tell you that, Mack.

This baby was deserted by its mother
and it's going to need a new one.

Claire...

Are you OK?
l'm fine.

You do know that we have
to call the police right now?

Of course, Mack. l haven't
taken leave of my senses.

l just wanted you to see her,
so l waited till you got home, that's all.

She's so beautiful.

l just wanted you to see her.

l told you that baby wasn't kidnapped.

l said ''Mister, there's no way this vehicle
is worth as much as you gonna pay to tow it.''

But he didn't care. He tells me
''lt got sentimental value!''

What's so funny about that? Maybe it did.

Yeah, maybe he got his first piece in there.
Otis, watch your mouth.

What did he say, Mama?
Nothin', baby. Just bring me that meat loaf.

Also, this was the car he was sittin' in
the first time he was ever shot.

Man! He had some good times in there!

Are we gonna play Roundy-Roundy,
Uncle Simon?

Uh-uh. Time for bed, little girl.
One game. Come on, Mama.

You said we could play one game.


ln your pyjamas, teeth brushed. Go on.

Get ready to get whipped, home.

Don't you wanna stay home
and be with your uncle?

l gotta go out. l gotta meet some people.
Take it slow, Simon.

From the shoulders! You still got it!
l ain't over yet, baby.

Be back soon, Ma.

OK.

Anybody come from the shoulders any more,
huh? Anybody got the hands, huh?

Man, l wish. Seem like
every time you turn around,...

..some sucker's comin' from the pocket...
and he's strapped.

You know, l never laid any shit on you, did l?

l love you, Otis. And l love my sister.

l don't want her to have any more pain
than she's already had.

You know, she's suffering here
every night till you come home.

We don't even get into that no more. When
we're together, we try and have it be good.

lf we ain't talkin' about it, why you gotta
talk about it? lt ain't gonna change nothin'.

You sure? Maybe we can figure out...
something together.

What, man? You gonna figure out somethin'
that nobody else around here thought of?

Later, Simon.
Hey. Hey.

Plenty have gotten out, Otis.

l don't want out.
Bullshit.

Without my set, l'm nothin'.
They care about me, man.

Hey, you wanna be
gangbanging when you're 25?

Shit.

l'll never live to be 25.

l gotta roll.

l'll call you Friday.

Drive safely.

Kelley!

Kelley!

Mama!

Well, look who's up and at 'em. Somebody
leave your curtains open last night?

l asked them to. l wanted to see this.

City of the angels.

l have seen the light.

Mazel tov.

l'll be right back.

Hi, Jackson.

Let me see that elbow. Go on, just one look.

l wanna see if it's as good as my knee.

This is just a scrape, man. Shit, my knee
was a real mess. This thing is just half-bad.

Did Adam push you?

Should we talk to him?

How come?
He's an asshole.

Maybe, but... we could discuss it.

You havin' a bad day?

Did you get a letter from your mom today?

Did she say she missed you?

Oh, man. My mom used to do that.
Made me nuts.

They love you so much, they don't even know
it's gonna make you feel terrible.

l missed my mom so much
the first year l came here.

And then when she wrote me and said
she missed me... l felt so lonely.

ls that how you feel?

Well, you got me.

told him anyway. What else would Harlan do?

The only way he wouldn't have told him
is if l had told him to tell him.

l don't think l can talk
about Harlan again tonight.

l've been begging you to get away
from him for eight years.

What, so l can go start
a new immigration practice on my own?

The night when l thought those boys
were gonna kill me, l realised...

..l hate fucking immigration law.

No, you don't. You like it
and you're good at it.

What you hate is being partners
with an asshole like Harlan.

We don't have to talk about this.
Maybe you hate some other part of your life.

What? What did you say?

When a person thinks they're about to die,
nothing looks like it was worth their time.

That's not what you were gonna say.
Then l guess l don't have to say anything.

Look, Mack, l don't even know what
l'm gonna say from one second to the next.

The world doesn't make any sense to me
any more. What's going on?

There are babies lying around in the streets.
There are people living in boxes.

There are people ready to shoot you
if you look at them.

And we're getting used to it.

The world is so nuts, it makes me wonder
about all the choices that we've made.

Jesus Christ.
What?

Oh, shit!

Let's see what you... Wow.

Agh! Damn! That smarts!

Hold it up. Apply pressure.
Pressure, pressure.

The hospital are gonna have to sew that up.
No. Really? l don't think it's that bad.

Here. Let's see. Take it off.

Oh, God.

Look at this.
Under the water.

See what happens when you yell at me?
Never again, baby.

Maybe next time you'll be a little more
understanding when l bitch about my life.

Ow, ow, ow! Here. Let me, let me.

l'm gonna get my purse.
l'm gonna take you to St John's.

You better sit down for a second.
l don't think l need to get this sewn up.

Mack, are you afraid of a few stitches?

l'm not afraid of anything.
l just think we oughta discuss this.

You're kidding, right?

What, are you going into shock?

l just hate seeing my blood spill
out of me like that. Does everybody...

Earthquake!

Big one. Let's get outta here. Run!



l'm sorry. l'm never complaining again.
Bullshit.

No, no. l swear.
You'll forget about all this tomorrow.

Did you feel that? l think
there's an aftershock coming.

Sally! Did your chandelier fall down again?

No.
Oh, good!


What's the matter?
Claire!

lt's Byron. l don't know what's wrong
with him. l dialled 911. The line's busy.

l don't know what's happening.
lt's gonna be OK. We'll be right there.

He's bleeding!
No, he's not. That's Mack.


Yes. l need an ambulance right way.
222 Avondale.

What?

Yes. Yes.

Male. 79.

Heart attack maybe.


Mack!

Over here! Come on!

Give me a flyby!

Yeah!

(baby crying)

(distant voice)

(baby screaming)

(baby gurgling)

(baby crying)

(flies buzzing)

Mack.

Mack, wake up.

So, now, tell me that again.
You have the baby at home now?

Mack, that's wonderful.
No, that's not what l said.

l said Claire wants to adopt the baby.
Claire is so great.

So what's the problem? You're not allowed
to just keep every baby you find.

Aren't there laws about that kind of thing?
There is a process you can go through.

And Claire has already
started collecting the forms.

She is the most self-actualised
person l ever met.

She is this week.

Home sweet home.
Mr Davis.

Hiya, Leonard. Good to see ya.
All right, just toss me in.

Just roll me back and just flip me in.
l'm gonna go check the car, OK, sweetie?

See you back at the house, OK, Tony?

Mabel, l am never gonna
forget the times we had.

As you know, my name is Esther.
My mother's name was Esther...

..and since you have been kinder than my
mother was, l have given you a better name.

When l think of the experience that changed
my life, l will think appreciatively of you.

You are very kind. Remember,
if you start to feel some pressure in there,...

..it's time to get the pus drained.

l love it when you talk that way
about the pus!

Don't you have a favourite charity
to give this to? A favourite child?

A favourite horse?
This is very unusual for me.

l'm notoriously cheap. Ask anyone.
(Mack) lt's true.

Goodbye, Davis.
OK, a hug. Come on, a hug, a hug.

OK.
There we go. OK.

So long. Bye.
Take it easy.


So, tell me about this life change.

lt's not a life change.
l had some kind of vision,...

..some insight,
but l don't wanna talk about it.

Tell him. He's your best friend.
We're talking about his new baby.

Besides, if you talk about stuff,
maybe that takes the place of doing it.

That's never been one of your big problems.
No kidding.

So... Claire wants this baby,
but you're not too high on the idea.

And it's not that you don't like kids.

Roberto's maybe the best thing that ever
happened in your life. But he's 15 now.

He's pretty much done with you.
He'll be moving out.

You thought you'd get back to the freedom
you had back when you were first married.

Fact is, you feel
you're getting old way too fast.

The last thing you had in mind
was a new family,...
