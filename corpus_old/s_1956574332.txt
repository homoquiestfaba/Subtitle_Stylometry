DO WE KNOW WHERE
IT'S HEADED?

ANY WORD FROM THE COCKPIT?

AMY?

Amy: YES. I HAVE
TO SPEAK VERY FAST.

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE YOU'RE HEADED?

NO.

PEOPLE IN COACH THINK
IT'S A ROUTINE EMERGENCY.

WE'VE ASKED FOR A DOCTOR,
BUT NONE'S ON BOARD.

THEY STILL THINK
IT'S A HEART ATTACK.

CAN YOU TELL US
ANYTHING MORE
ABOUT THE HIJACKERS?

YES. THEY HAVE
KNIVES AND MACE.

THEY SAY THEY HAVE A BOMB.

THEY WERE IN SEATS
3D, 5D, 1A, 3A.

WE'RE LOSING ALTITUDE
PRETTY RAPIDLY.

HOW ARE THE PEOPLE
WHO WERE STABBED?

ONE FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S OK.
I'M NOT SURE.

THE OTHER MAY NOT MAKE IT.
WE HAVE HER ON OXYGEN.

OH, MY GOD!
SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE!

WHAT'S HAPPENING?

AMY, ARE YOU STILL THERE?

WE'RE IN RAPID DESCENT.
WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

CAN YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
AND TELL US WHERE YOU ARE?

DO YOU RECOGNIZE ANYTHING?

AMY, DO YOU KNOW
YOU'RE HEADED
TOWARD KENNEDY?

I SEE WATER, BUILDINGS.

WE'RE FLYING LOW.

WE'RE FLYING
VERY, VERY LOW.

WE'RE FLYING WAY TOO LOW.

OH, MY GOD!
WE'RE...


CAN YOU HEAR ME?
AMY? AMY?

CAN YOU HEAR ME, AMY?

I THINK I LOST HER.

[OVERHEAD BELL CHIMES]

[OVERHEAD BELLS CHIMING]

[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

Newscaster: WE HAVE NEWS
OF A TRAGIC EVENT.

APPARENTLY, AN AIRPLANE HIT
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER

AT THE TIP OF MANHATTAN.

THERE IT IS.

Second newscaster:
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A LIVE PICTURE.

THE PLANE HIT
ONE OF THE TOWERS

NEAR THE TOP
OF THE BUILDING.

HERE'S ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE.
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE...

Third newscaster:
...DEBRIS ALL OVER,
SMOKE IS BILLOWING

FROM THE TOP 10 OR SO
FLOORS OF THE TOWER.

I WOULD ASSUME THAT
IT'S BEING EVACUATED.

MOM?
IN HERE!

NOW WE'RE TRYING
TO FIND OUT

WHAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT
COLLIDED...

Fourth newscaster:
...THEIR OFFICES.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS
RESPONDING TO THIS EVENT,

WHICH HAPPENED AROUND
8:45 THIS MORNING,

AND WE HAVE SO FAR NOT
BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN WORD

ON HOW MANY CASUALTIES
WE MAY EXPECT.

THE PLANE COULD
HAVE BEEN EN ROUTE
TO NEWARK OR KENNEDY.

AND FOR SOME REASON,
IT STRAYED OFF PATH.

PLANE'S CIRCLE THIS AREA

AS THEY WAIT IN ROTATION
TO LAND AT NEWARK.

ALTHOUGH,
HOW AN AIRCRAFT COULD HIT
ONE OF THOSE MASSIVE TOWERS

ON SUCH A CLEAR DAY,
IT'S VERY HARD TO COMPREHEND.

HI, THIS IS
MELODY HOMER.

I JUST WANTED
TO SEND A MESSAGE

TO MY HUSBAND,
LEROY HOMER, VIA ARCS.

HE'S FIRST OFFICER
ON FLIGHT 93.

Man: UH, 93, OK.
UH, THINGS ARE PRETTY HECTIC.

THAT FLIGHT IS PROCEEDING
NORMALLY, THOUGH.


I CAN TAKE
YOUR TRANSMISSION NOW.

HI, HON.

I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE OK.

MELODY.


NEW YORK TERMINAL.

TERMINAL, CAN YOU
HELP US TRACK A PLANE

THAT'S STRAYED OFF PATH?
WE'VE LOST TRANSPONDER.

OK, YEAH, I GOT A TARGET
THAT KEEPS COASTING.

OK, GOT 'EM AGAIN.

HE'S OVER STATEN ISLAND.

DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS?

NO, HE'S TRACKING
TOWARDS MANHATTAN.

HE'S MOVING FAST.

LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
ANOTHER ONE COMING IN.


Newscaster: THE PLANE
HIT THE NORTH TOWER
OF THE WORLD TRADE...

THERE!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE!

WE JUST SAW ANOTHER ONE.

YES, WE JUST SAW ANOTHER PLANE
APPARENTLY GO INTO...

Second newscaster:
...HITTING THE SOUTH TOWER.

THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

A HUGE FIREBALL
FROM THIS EXPLOSION.

THAT WOULD BE THE SECOND...

Third newscaster: 2 PLANES.

THIS RAISES, UM...

THIS HAS TO BE
DELIBERATE, FOLKS.

HERE YOU ARE.

WOULD YOU LIKE
COFFEE OR TEA?

TEA.
TEA.

WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COFFEE OR TEA?

SOME COFFEE WOULD
BE GREAT, THANK YOU.

SURE.

CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE, SIR?

NO, THANK YOU.

Stewardess: SOME TEA?

Newscaster:
THE SECOND PLANE
HIT AT 9:03...

Girl: CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE JUICE?

THE PEOPLE WERE
ALREADY AT THEIR DESKS.

WHAT'S THE WORD
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, MADISON?

PLEASE?

...THE FIRES SPREADING
TO OTHER FLOORS.

YOU KNOW, FIGHTING A FIRE...

I'M HUNGRY.

OH, ALL RIGHT.

LET'S GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

...IT'S DIFFICULT
TO CONTAIN THE FIRE.

THIS IS A HUGE TRAGEDY,
ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

UNDOUBTEDLY, THIS IS
TERRORIST RELATED,

BUT WE CAN ONLY GUESS AS
TO WHO IS BEHIND THIS.

IS THAT A FIRE, MOMMY?

YES, IT IS.
DRINK YOUR JUICE

AND DON'T WATCH
THE TV, GIRLS.

Madison: IS IT A MOVIE?

Mother: NO.

IT'S POSSIBLE
THEY WERE IN CONTROL.

DRINK.

THEY MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE
TAKEN OVER THE PLANE

ONCE IT WAS IN THE AIR.

IT'S A SUNNY, CLEAR DAY,
SO VISIBILITY WOULD
NOT BE A PROBLEM.

Girl: I NEED SOME PAPER.

GIRLS, WATCH
YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

I'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

THERE'S A MESSAGE
FROM YOUR WIFE.

IN A MINUTE. WE'RE COMING
ON CLEVELAND CENTER.

TOMORROW'S
MY ANNIVERSARY.

NO KIDDING.
HOW MANY YEARS?

FIVE.

I'M GONNA SURPRISE HER,
TAKE HER TO LONDON.


YOU'D BETTER
CHECK THIS OUT.

"BEWARE COCKPIT INTRUSION.

TWO AIRCRAFT HIT
WORLD TRADE CENTER."

JESUS.

BETTER VERIFY THAT.

[EXCITED CHATTER]

DID YOU GET IT OUT?

2 SECTORS ARE COVERED.

I'M WORKING ON THE OTHERS.

ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENTS?

THEY'RE COMING IN NOW.


YOU'RE WELCOME.

ALL RIGHT.

ARE YOU ALL DONE
THERE, SIR?

I'M OK.

Man: WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

JUST A LITTLE TURBULENCE.

WHAT KIND
OF TURBULENCE?

WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

IF ANYTHING, THERE'LL BE...

[TELEPHONE RINGS]


HELLO?

Tom: DEENA.
OH, TOM. ARE YOU OK?

THE CATASTROPHES HERE,
SADLY, COULD BE GREATER.

WE... WE CERTAINLY HOPE...

Second reporter:
UH, AND IN NEW YORK...

DEFINITELY GONNA BE
A CHALLENGE.

UNITED 93, VERIFY YOUR
FLIGHT LEVEL AS 3-5-0.

UNITED 93, VERIFY YOUR
FLIGHT LEVEL AS 3-5-0.

Reporter, on television:
YOU KNOW, ONE THING
THAT I WOULD ASSUME

THAT IS BEING
CLOSELY WATCHED

IS THE POSSIBILITY
THAT OTHER PLANES
HAVE BEEN HIJACKED.

Woman: 9-1-1.
WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

THIS IS DEENA BURNETT
IN SAN RAMON.

MY HUSBAND JUST CALLED
FROM UNITED FLIGHT 93

TO SAY THAT HIS PLANE
HAS BEEN HIJACKED.

I'M SORRY, WHERE
DID YOU SAY HE WAS?

HE'S ON UNITED FLIGHT 93.
HE CALLED ME FROM HIS
CELL PHONE A MINUTE AGO.

HE SAID THAT HIS PLANE
HAD BEEN HIJACKED.

UH, UH, A PASSENGER
HAS BEEN KILLED,

AND THERE'S WEAPONS
ON BOARD.

HOLD ON, PLEASE.
I'M GOING TO TRANSFER YOU.

N-NO, WAIT!

THIS IS SERGEANT ROSS OF

I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
CAN YOU CLARIFY?

NO, PLEASE, JUST...
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE.

MY HUSBAND, HIS PLANE
DID NOT GO INTO THE TOWERS.

THE GUY THEY KNIFED IS DEAD.

HE'S DEAD?

WHO'S DEAD?
WHO?

I TRIED TO HELP HIM,
BUT I... I COULDN'T GET A PULSE.

TOM, THEY'RE HIJACKING
PLANES ALL UP AND DOWN
THE EAST COAST.

THEY'RE TAKING THEM
AND HITTING A DESIGNATED
TARGET.

THEY'VE ALREADY
HIT BOTH TOWERS
AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.

OH, MY GOD.

IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION.

THEY'RE...

THEY'RE FLYING PLANES
INTO BUILDINGS UP
AND DOWN THE COAST.

IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION.

Deena: WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?

planes into buildings
all over the place.

Tom: DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S INVOLVED?

THEY DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS.

THEY'RE SPECULATING
CARGO PLANES,

PRIVATE PLANES,
AND COMMERCIAL.
NO ONE KNOWS.

HOW MANY PLANES
ARE THERE?

THEY'RE NOT SURE.
AT LEAST 3, MAYBE MORE.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

Tom: OK...

DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S INVOLVED?

NO.

WE'RE HEADING BACK TO NEW YORK,
BACK TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.

Tom: NO. NO, WAIT.

WAIT, NO. WE'RE TURNING
BACK THE OTHER WAY.

WE'RE GOING SOUTH.

Deena: WHAT DO YOU SEE?

I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

WE'RE OVER A...
A RURAL AREA.
IT'S JUST FIELDS.

HEY, TOM...

HEY! HEY!


NO, TOM...

THERE'S 3 OF THEM.

THEY'RE THREATENING
TO BLOW UP THE PLANE.

OHH... OK, UM...

DID THEY HURT YOU?

NO. THEY SENT EVERYBODY
TO THE BACK OF THE PLANE.

ONE OF THEM'S GOT A BOMB
STRAPPED TO HIS WAIST.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
IS REALLY HAPPENING TO ME.

YOU... YOU'LL BE OK.

YOU'LL BE...
YOU'LL BE OK.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS...

THAT'S PARAMOUNT.

I CAN FLY

THIS ISN'T

CAN ANYBODY

IT WOULD BE SUCH A HELP.

IF YOU COULD
TAKE THEM TO SCHOOL?

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

Reporter: ...HAS STRUCK
THE PENTAGON, AND HERE IS
LIVE FOOTAGE FROM THE SCENE.

JERRY, EYEWITNESSES
ON HIGHWAY 110 SAW A PLANE
FLY INTO THE STRUCTURE.

IT STRUCK THE SOUTHWEST
SIDE, WHERE THERE...

OH, MY GOD.
[BREATHING RAPIDLY]

OH, MY... OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD. [CRYING]

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

TOM?
DEENA.

ARE YOU OK?
UH, NO, I'M NOT.

THEY JUST HIT
THE PENTAGON. I THOUGHT
IT WAS YOUR PLANE.

WHAT?
WHAT, WHAT?

THEY JUST HIT THE PENTAGON.

THEY JUST HIT
THE PENTAGON.
WHAT?!

Deena: THEY THINK THAT
5 PLANES HAVE BEEN HIJACKED,

AND THEY BELIEVE
THAT ALL OF THEM
ARE COMMERCIAL PLANES.

I HAVEN'T HEARD THEM
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
WHICH AIRLINE,

BUT, UH, ALL
OF THEM ORIGINATED
ON THE EAST COAST.

DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S INVOLVED?

NO.

WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY OF THEM
HAVING A BOMB ON BOARD?

I DON'T THINK THEY DO. I MEAN,
I THINK THEY'RE JUST USING
THAT FOR CROWD CONTROL.

OK, A PLANE CAN SURVIVE
A BOMB, TOM, IF IT'S
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

DID YOU CALL
THE AUTHORITIES?

YES. THEY'RE HERE.

THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PLANE.

LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA
DO SOMETHING.

WE'RE, UH, PUTTING
A PLAN TOGETHER.

WHO'S HELPING YOU?

JUST SOME PEOPLE,
GOOD PEOPLE.

DON'T WORRY.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

[ALL SCREAM]

[PLANE ENGINE ROARING]

KEEP YOUR SEAT BELTS ON.

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

ARE YOU OK?
IS EVERYBODY OK?

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
FELLAS, CALM DOWN.

OH, MY GOD.

WHAT ABOUT
THAT CART?

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

I'VE GOT A SCHEMATIC
OF THE PLANE.

HOW WIDE
IS THIS CORRIDOR?

UH, 18 INCHES.

WHAT ABOUT FIRST CLASS?
24 INCHES. IT'S 2 FEET.

WE'LL MOVE SINGLE FILE.
WE'LL SPREAD OUT
WHEN WE GET TO THE GALLEY.

I GOT THE CART.

Reporter, on television:
HERE IS AN AERIAL VIEW
OF THE PENTAGON.

YOU CAN SEE THE SOUTHWEST
SIDE OF THE BUILDING
ENGULFED IN SMOKE.

THIS IS THE THIRD AIRPLANE
TO HAVE HIT A BUILDING.

THEY ARE ALL BELIEVED TO
HAVE BEEN COMMERCIAL JETS

THAT WERE TAKEN OVER
BY HIJACKERS...

WHAT SHOULD WE DO,
VAUGHN?

SHOULD WE CALL
THE POLICE?

THE POLICE CAN'T FLY,
ALICE.

THEY HIT
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
WITH HIJACKED PLANES,

AND THEY JUST GOT
THE PENTAGON.

LISTEN TO ME, ALICE.

YOU'VE GOT TO CALL MARK
ON HIS CELL PHONE,

ALL RIGHT, AND TELL HIM
THIS IS A SUICIDE MISSION.

TELL HIM THEY HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER THEY CAN

TO TRY AND GET CONTROL
OF THE PLANE BACK.

WE CAN CALL
THE POLICE AFTERWARDS.

TELL MARK THAT THEY HAVE TO
GET THAT PLANE BACK.

TELL HIM THIS
IS A SUICIDE MISSION.

[RECORDED CHIMES PLAY]

THE CIRCUITS ARE BUSY.

TRY AGAIN.

OK, YEAH.

Man: HE'S TOO SCARED.

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]

Tom: LOOK, MY WIFE
WAS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

SHE SAID A PLANE CAN SURVIVE
A BOMB THAT GOES OFF
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

THIS IS LISA JEFFERSON,
SHIFT SUPERVISOR.

I UNDERSTAND YOUR PLANE'S
BEEN HIJACKED?

YES. I'M TODD BEAMER.
I'M ON UNITED FLIGHT 93.

WE'RE, UH...
WE'RE OVER OHIO, MAYBE.

UH...

THE HIJACKERS HAVE KNIVES,

AND THEY'RE IN THE COCKPIT
FLYING THE PLANE, I GUESS.

HOW MANY PASSENGERS
ARE ABOARD THIS FLIGHT?

MAYBE 40. 2 ARE LYING
IN THE CORRIDOR...

THE CAPTAIN
AND THE FIRST OFFICER.

I DON'T KNOW IF...

ARE YOU STILL THERE?

Lisa Jefferson:
YES, I'M HERE.

TODD?

IF AT ANY TIME YOU THINK
YOUR LIFE IS THREATENED,

LAY DOWN THE PHONE,
BUT DON'T HANG UP.

LEAVE THE LINE OPEN.

NO, I'M OK. I CAN TALK.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT?
MONEY OR RANSOM OR WHAT?

I'LL BE BACK.

HONEY, ARE YOU THERE?

JACK?

PICK UP, SWEETIE.

OH, WELL.

I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

[ON ANSWERING MACHINE]
WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE
PROBLEM ON THE PLANE.

I'M TOTALLY FINE.

I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN ANYTHING. AAH!

I'M COMFORTABLE,
AND I'M OK FOR NOW.

UH...

JUST A LITTLE PROBLEM.

[SHOWER RUNNING]

I LOVE YOU.

PLEASE TELL MY FAMILY
THAT I LOVE THEM, TOO.

BYE, HONEY.

IT'S YOUR TURN.

I KNOW YOUR MOTHER WILL WANNA
TALK TO YOU, ELIZABETH.

WHAT'S HER NUMBER?
I'LL DIAL IT.

Reporter, on television:
AND THEN AT 9:27,
A THIRD PLANE...

ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S THE LATEST?

LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A FOURTH PLANE
ON ITS WAY HERE, TOO.

UNITED PLANE,
FLIGHT 93.

THEY'RE ESTIMATING
IT'S 25 MINUTES
FROM DOWNTOWN.

HAS NORAD BEEN NOTIFIED?
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

I CALLED F.A.A.,
HERNDON. THEY SAY
THEY'RE WORKING ON IT.

WORKING ON IT?

WHERE'S THE VICE PRESIDENT?

THEY'RE BRINGING
HIM OVER FROM
BLAIR HOUSE NOW.


JESUS.

F.A.A. JUST GAVE AN ORDER
TO GROUND ALL PLANES.

HOW MANY ARE STILL UP?

TOTAL 4,500, BUT WE'VE
BEEN BRINGING OURS IN.

WHAT'S THE PRESENT
AIR SPEED ON 93?

IT'S OVER 450 KNOTS.

AT WHAT, 12,000 FEET?
THE AIRCRAFT COULD
BREAK UP AT THAT SPEED.

IT'S POSSIBLE.

Reporter: THIS REALLY
IS UNPRECEDENTED.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

I GUESS YOU COULD GO
BACK TO PEARL HARBOR,

BUT WE REALLY
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S OVER.


THIS IS AN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT KIND OF ENEMY.


HELLO?

MOM?

IT'S ME, ELIZABETH.

HELLO, DARLING.

UH, ARE YOU OK?

MOM, WE'VE BEEN
HIJACKED, AND I'M
CALLING TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

WH-WHY WOULD YOU
WANNA DO THAT?

MOM...

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

Reporter, on television:
EVACUATING THE PENTAGON IS OF
COURSE FAR LESS PROBLEMATIC...

NO.

ELIZABETH, UM...

I HAVE MY ARMS AROUND YOU,

AND I AM HOLDING YOU,

AND I LOVE YOU.

I FEEL YOUR ARMS
AROUND ME, AND...

I LOVE YOU, TOO.

BUT, MOM...

WE'RE BEING HIJACKED,
AND I'M NOT GONNA
COME HOME.

ELIZABETH, DARLING,
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME.

WE DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS
ARE GONNA TURN OUT, SO...

LET'S... LET'S JUST...
BE HERE

IN THE PRESENT. LET'S...

LOOK OUT THE WINDOW

AT THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE SKY,

AND LET'S JUST...

BREATHE.

AND LET'S TAKE
A FEW DEEP BREATHS.

[INHALING AND EXHALING]

[QUIET CONVERSATIONS]

LIZ?

WE'RE GONNA VOTE SOON.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
TOGETHER.

IS IT TRUE
ABOUT THE TRADE CENTER?

YES. YOU KNOW
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU.

LIZ, ARE THE HIJACKERS
BLOWING UP PLANES?

NO.

ARE YOU SURE?

THEY SAID THEY'VE GOT
A BOMB ON OUR PLANE.

UH... I HAVEN'T
HEARD THAT.

ARE THEY GONNA
BLOW UP THIS PLANE?

I MEAN, THEY SAID
THEY WOULD.

I DON'T THINK SO,
JEREMY.

ARE THEY GONNA
CRASH US INTO THE
WORLD TRADE CENTER?

NO.

NO, THE... THE...
THE TOWERS...

NO, THEY WON'T DO THAT.

WHY NOT?

THEY'VE DONE THAT.

WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL
US WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WE NEED TO KNOW!

HOW DO YOU KNOW
THIS IS GONNA WORK?

[OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS]

Man: THERE'S A GUY
WITH A BOMB UP THERE.

Second man: THEY FLEW
2 PLANES INTO THE TRADE CENTER,
ONE INTO THE PENTAGON.

IT'S THE SAME THING
HERE, OK?

YEAH, BUT PEOPLE...
THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.

WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

SHOULD WE
RETAKE THE PLANE?



HOW MANY OF THEM ARE THERE?

3, 4.

JESUS. I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU.

AW, JESUS, I...

I WANT TO HOLD YOU
SO MUCH.

I LOVE YOU, TOO, JEREMY.

UM, YOU'RE...

DO THEY HAVE GUNS?

NO. KNIVES.

AND THERE'S
3 PASSENGERS ON BOARD

ABOUT AS BIG AS ME.
I THINK MAYBE...

THERE ARE NO GUNS?

NO. THEY WOULD HAVE
SHOWN THEM TO US.


THEN I THINK
YOU SHOULD DO IT.

OK.

Man: ...WE CAN, NOW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

I'LL USE MY PLASTIC
BUTTER KNIFE.

MM-HMM. OK.

KEEP ME POSTED.

NO ONE AT LANGLEY
KNOWS WHERE

AND ANDREWS,
ARE THEY SCRAMBLED, TOO?

WE HAVEN'T REACHED
THEM, BUT THEY ASKED
FOR A HEADS UP ON THAT.

WHO? ANDREWS?

THEY ASKED THE F.A.A.
IF ANY ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN

TO INTERCEPT FLIGHT 93
AS OF 0936 HOURS.

WHO WERE THEY TALKING TO?

HERNDON COMMAND CENTER.

IT'S BEING ROUTED
THROUGH THERE, SIR.

OK. GET THROUGH
TO NORAD.

LET'S SEE IF WE
CAN GET A READ ON THIS

BEFORE IT GETS HERE.

...OTHER THAN THAT THEY BOTH

93 WAS EN ROUTE

[TV NEWS PLAYING QUIETLY

MARK, THIS IS YOUR MOTHER.

WELL, APPARENTLY,
IT'S TERRORISTS,

AND THEY'RE HELLBENT
ON CRASHING THE AIRCRAFT,

SO IF YOU CAN, TRY TO...

TAKE OVER THE AIRCRAFT.

THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
MUCH OF A PLAN TO

LANDING THE AIRCRAFT
NORMALLY,

SO GROUP SOME PEOPLE

AND PERHAPS...

DO YOUR BEST
TO TAKE CONTROL...

OF IT.

I... I... I LOVE YOU,

WELL, THEN, THE FIGHTERS
ARE GONNA HAVE TO ENGAGE

OK, CONTACT IADS.
SEE IF THEY CAN EXECUTE

HAVE YOU BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH LANGLEY?

THE JETS ARE
