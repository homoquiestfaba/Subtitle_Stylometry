All right, ladies!

Everyone up!

On your feet now! Up!
Everyone out of the water!

Move it! Move!
On your feet!

( <i>women screaming</i> )
Now! Let's go!

Move now! Let's go!

Hold it! Down on the ground,
right now! Do it!

All right, everybody through
being heroes now, huh?!

Move it!

Everyone in the lockers!

Come on now!
Get in there now!

I want those lockers
open now!

I want your purses in my bag
and your keys in my hand!

Hurry it up!
Give me that.

Come on. Let's go.

You, where's your keys?

Oh...
Hurry up!

Come on. Hurry up!

Somebody... help me, please.

I've been shot.

Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

We got 'em. We got 'em.
Let's go. Let's go.

The keys...
Come on!

Which one goes to which car?

Frank?

Three men in masks,
armed robbery.

Weird thing is,
they weren't even armed

before they took the gun
off the security guard.

Dispatch says shots fired,
Frank.

Yeah. Victoria Morena
fought back with OC spray.

Took one in the chest
for it.

She had pepper spray.

Yeah, which means one
of our guys has got Mace face.

When we find him,
we'll know it.

And all the hospitals
have been contacted.

How's she doing?

She's, uh, hanging
in there for now.

She's with
the paramedics.

You're going
to be okay.

All right, witnesses?

What's going on?

Horatio, there's something
you ought to know.

She's okay, but, uh,
one of the witnesses is Marisol.

CAINE:
Give us a minute, please.
Will you?

Marisol...

The one day I decide
to pamper myself, right?

Marisol, I don't like
the look of that.

I'm going to send you
to the hospital

and have you
checked out.
No, I'm fine.

I... I just fell.

Marisol, what happened?

I don't know.

It... just happened so fast.

They were just suddenly there,
and...

I keep seeing them--
you know, those masks.

Let's go!
( <i>women screaming</i> )

Move!

Horatio,
you get them. Okay?

I will.

 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com</font>

 <font color="#ffff00">Cync by</font>
 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com</font>

Horatio, looks like cars
were the focus.

The type of rides parked
outside this place

was like an invitation.

What'd they get, Frank?

Lambo, Viper,
Aston Martin.

Not bad for a day's work.

The good news is these exotic
cars all had tracking devices.

CAINE:
Okay, put out
a broadcast.

DELKO:
H! Hey, H!

Where's my sister?

She's at the hospital.
She's going to be fine.

What happened?

She's got a gash over the eye,

and I think she may
have a concussion,

but she's going to be fine.

I'm going to the hospital.

Eric, she's going to be okay.

I need you here.

I'll call you from the hospital
when I get something.

You guys detectives?
CSIs.

Found something
weird on the victim

you should
know about.
What's that?

Blood spray
around her mouth.

What's weird about that?
Someone gave her CPR?

MAN:
One, two, three, four...

It was there
when we found her.

Maybe a civilian revived her.

Did a good job, too.

It's why she's alive.

I wonder why they
didn't say anything.

Maybe they helped her
out of guilt.

You think whoever helped her

could be involved
in the robbery?

I'll ask around
and find out.

I'm going to go inside
and look for a casing.

PARAMEDIC:
Might find
a bullet, too.

Her wound's
a through-
and-through.

Thanks.

Excuse me, guys.

I need to talk to you
for a second.

Oh, yeah, sure.
What's up?

Well, thanks for saving
the victim's life.

The blood on your shirt--
you gave her CPR, right?

Oh, yeah.

Uh, my pleasure.

Just glad
I could help.

Just I'm curious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?

She dies,
I get sued.

I understand. No good deed
goes unpunished, right?

Yeah, something like that.

So are we done here?

No, no, no, actually,
we're just...

we're just getting started.

Found you.

I'm, I'm confused, uh...

Pete.
Pete.

No men are allowed
in the women's pool area, right,

not even a massage therapist?

Well... no.

You walked in
after the shooting,

past the sauna where the women
were held, right?

That's right.

How come no one saw you?

Because he came
from the closet.

I found the a peephole
in the wall.

You involved in this, Pete?

You let these men in?

No. No way.

I... just...

I watch. That's it.

I don't believe you.

Why not?

Because you lied to me
already twice.

Let's go.

Hey.
Got something?

Yeah. Cooper called.

He accessed
the Viper's GPS unit,

and it's transmitting
from the pier of Miami.

So you think the carjackers

are getting ready to ship it
overseas?

Yeah, looks that way.

I'm going to grab Cooper
in the mobile track unit.

We're going to
find out for sure.

( <i>phone beeping</i> )
All right.

It's Tripp.

Great.

Detain him
till somebody can pick up him.

All right.

Got a guy trying to check
himself into Miami General.

Guess what he got.

Mace burn.

Bingo.

Great. Let's divide and conquer.

Well, that's
gotta hurt.

I got stung by a bee.

It's nothing really.

Enough to get you
in Miami General Hospital.

Yeah, I'm allergic.

But not to bees;
to pepper spray.

Where are your keys?!

You!

Come on. Hurry up!

You robbed the spa this morning,
Billy.

No idea what you're
talking about.

We're talking
about where you got this.

We found it parked around
the corner of the hospital.
It's an Astin Martin

That's a pretty nice car.

It ain't mine, though.

Empty your pockets.

Empty your pockets, Billy.

Well, I guess that clears up
the car thing

since you've got the keys.

CAINE:
And the zip ties
that were used

to bind the security guard
at the spa.

I didn't hurt anybody.

Who are your friends,
Mr. Robinson?

Look, we were just supposed
to tie up the guard, okay?

Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

But they did get hurt, Billy,
didn't they?

Witnesses said
the guy

that got Maced
didn't shoot anyone,

so do yourself a favor

and tell us who did.

I can't.

It's better to be in jail
than dead.

Then jail it is.

Be advised: we followed
the GPS unit of our Viper

to the Lion's Gate Shipyard
on Pike Street.

We're requesting backup, please.
Thank you.

Uh-oh.

WOLFE:
What?

Signal's moving.

Okay, so are we.

Wait. You gotta
stay here, man.

No way.

Cooper, you're unarmed.

Hey, you brought me out here,

 <i>and</i> somebody's gotta
to read the receiver.

Okay. Hang back.

Signal's on the move again.

No way.

Hey, ( <i>whistles</i> ) stop.

Is that the GPS unit?

They took the damn thing
out of the Viper.

I feel stupid.

They could be the stupid ones.
It could give us something.

Let's get back
to the lab.

MAN ( <i>over radio</i> ):
 <i>Patrols rolling Code 3</i>

 <i>in pursuit</i>
 <i>of a 2005 Lamborghini, orange,</i>

 <i>Florida license 16W649,</i>
 <i>heading southbound on I-95.</i>

I swear I didn't even
see you guys.

You know, the sun
and my music was blasting.

You got an excuse
for going 150 miles an hour?

Too much caffeine?

What about for shooting
Victoria Morena?

What?
What are you talking about?

Talking about
where'd you get

the Lamborghini
from, Andretti?

It's Hayden.
Hayden Cruise.

And I got the car
from my car guy.

He's been looking
for a Lambo for, like
two months for me.

Your car guy?

Yeah, Joe. You can
call him if you want.

Speed dial 11.

The number you are trying
to reach has been disconnected

or is no longer in service.

That's shocking.

It's disconnected.

What?

Hey, look, these cars
are like organs, you know?

You get on a list,
you wait.

And then when they call,
you buy it.

Otherwise,
somebody else will.

And you didn't think
the car was maybe stolen?

No, absolutely not.

You got a last name

for this Joe guy?

No. But I gave him, like,
a hundred grand cash.

It's a big chunk
of my trust fund.

That big chunk's
about to be impounded, Hayden.

Hey, if you
catch this guy,

do I get my money back or what?

Look, a woman was shot today.

I'm sorry.

It's just, it's
a lot of money.

Get his car keys.

I heard we recovered
all three stolen cars.

Is that right?

Two and a half.

Got the bait and switch
at the shipyard.

All that was left of the Viper
was the tracking device.

You mean
they chopped it.

Yeah, problem is

it looks like they used
an acetylene torch,

and heat doesn't leave
a tool mark.

But the torch
would make it
too hot to handle.

Think he used
something to hold it?

He used a vise grip.

And imperfections can make
a unique match.

I'm going to Impound
to look at recently
chopped cars

to compare tool marks.

Meet me
at the garage.

This one's barely a car.

Better for us. Frame's exposed.

Hey, hand me the magnifier,
would you?

I think I got something.
Hand me the picture

of the GPS from the Viper.

Who's the proud illegal owner

of these tool marks?

This ring was run
by Carvell Watson.

His case is pending
for chopping cars.

He's probably out on bail.

We can change that.

I'll get you an address.

Hi,
Hey.

how you doing?

Good.

What can I do for you?

Save my life, I hope.

I, uh, got a new car

and I kinda had
a little accident.

Yeah? What kind of car is it?

A Viper SRT.

And what's the damage?

Well, the driver side door
is smushed in.

I can't
even open it.

I called the dealer
about getting

a new one, but they're,
like, five grand.

We might have something for you.

Let me go get the owner.

Thanks.

MAN:
How you doing?

Fine, thanks.

You're lucky.

Got a couple Viper doors
in today.

I bet you did.

Keep your hands

where I can see 'em,
Mr. Watson.

What now?

I'm going to call for a warrant.

I'll let you know
in about two minutes.

Victoria Morena.

Her heart suffered
too much trauma.

She died of cardiac arrest.

Bullets will do that
to you.

So we go from robbery to murder.

Witnesses said
the shooter kicked
her in the head.

Have Delko look
for trace.

The woman you shot this morning
just died, Carvell,

so you're looking at murder.

I didn't shoot anyone.

Somebody's trying
to set me up.

Here's some proof.

Here's a photograph
of the door

from the stolen vehicle
from the women's day spa

where there was an armed
robbery this morning.

It was at your shop.

You received stolen
property.

I had no idea
they were stolen.

What about these purses

from the women
at the spa?

What about 'em?
We found 'em

in the dumpster
behind your store.

Come on.

Everyone at the shop
uses that trash can.

Everybody else checks out.

This is crazy.

I told you
I'm being messed with!

You know, I feel exactly
the same way.

Book him.

Is that Victoria?

Who are you?

I'm her husband.

Look, Mr. Morena,
you shouldn't be here.

What are you
doing to her?

I know that this
is upsetting, okay,

but we have to process
your wife's body.

Hasn't she been
through enough already?

I want to catch the man
that did this to your wife

and this is going to help.

I was at the hospital with her.

She was stable.

I left Maria
for an hour.

And when I returned, she...

Look, I'm sorry.

I should have been there.

Please, just wait outside
in the lobby, okay?

I promise
I'll take good care of her.

The results on the trace
I pulled

from the victim's hair.

Just printed up.

I don't mean
to criticize,

but what took you
so long to collect it?

You can't process
a victim's body

until they're dead.

Got it.

So, I got C12,
H22 and O11.

That's sucrose.

Add dithiocarbamate
and you got a sugar mill.

Yeah. Great.

How many of those
are there in Miami?

Only one with
a high concentration
of potassium carbamate.

You lost me.

It's the chemical
composition of wood ash.

The fire at the Sullivan
sugar mill.

Three weeks ago.

That's enough time
to put in a chop shop.

There's the Viper.

Damn, they can do
a lot in a few hours.

Surgical strip.

I've seen cars completely pieced
out in under two hours.

Here we go.

MDPD! Down, everybody down!

Hands on your head!

Ryan!

H, I-I don't know what happened.

Mr. Wolfe, you didn't
have the shot.

I-I just froze.

Mr. Wolfe, you didn't have
the shot, you understand?

I understand.

You want to walk me through it?

I staged at the door.

Two suspects visible.

I made entry.

You ID yourselves?

Yeah.

Announced on entry.

Badges were clearly in view.

Go on.

I approached one guy
to pat him down...

next thing I know

another guy come out
of nowhere with a gauge.

Your weapon's drawn?

Yeah.

Well, you perceived a threat?

Yeah.

In Horatio's interview
he said that, uh,

you didn't have a clear shot;
is that what happened?

Ryan...

is that what happened?

Yeah, that's right.

Pepper spray
has a UV marking dye.

If this guy was near his buddy
when he got shot, we'll know it.

There it is, H.

So he was there.

Come on, hurry up!

Oh, God!

Yeah.

Now we got
two out of three,

but he's not
our shooter.

Witnesses said the shooter stood
about five feet from the others.

 <i>If he was standing</i>
 <i>that far away,</i>

 <i>he wouldn't get hit</i>
 <i>by pepper spray.</i>

So we've got one more to go.

Listen, we just went
through the purses

from the dumpster.

Credit cards are there,
but the IDs are missing.

I know car thieves
don't change their MO,

but they've got keys
and addresses.

Eric, we are talking
about home invasion.

Should I send cars?

Send one to every house.
Done.

Ma'am.

Ma'am, it's okay.

( <i>sobbing</i> ):
That man...

It was the same man.

The one from this
morning at the spa.

Did you see his face?

No.

He had that mask.

But it was him, his voice.

The one who shot that girl.

Okay, I want you
to try and relax.

( <i>sobbing</i> ):
My friends...

All my friends...
You have to do something.

Everyone from the spa is safe.

No, no, he took my Blackberry.

He said all my rich friends
were gonna get it.

TRIPP:
Horatio.

Paramedics are here.

What have you got?

We, uh, we got patrol cars at
all the other ladies' homes,

including Marisol's.

It's not gonna be
enough, Frank.

Why not?

He's got her PDA
and all her contacts.

That's too many to cover.

No way we can protect everyone.

That's exactly
what he's counting on.

So I guess this eliminates
Carvell, right?

'Cause he was in custody
when all this went down.

So who the hell is this guy?

I've never seen
a GTA escalate to houses.

Whoever he is, he's desperate.

That's the worst kind.

Damn.

No print?

No, I've got ridge detail,
but nothing makeable.

But ridge detail means
that he wasn't wearing gloves.

That's right--
epithelials on the rope.

That's good.

We'll get it to DNA.

Hey, you got any
results on that rope?

Almost.

Look, I'm sorry
about earlier, okay?

I didn't mean to be rude.

Whatever.

You know what? I was just
really worried about Marisol.

And not everything is something.

No, I know that.
It's just that...

Got a hit on the DNA
from the rope.

Prior B&E.

Javier Morena.

Let me see that.

Isn't that the spa
victim's last name?

Yeah. It is.

I can't believe
I felt sorry for you.

For God's sake,
I didn't kill my wife.

I must say,
it was a good cover-up.

The whole robbery thing.

Look, I wish you'd listen to me.

I was never near that spa.

What about
Cynthia Gilmore's house, huh?

How you gonna lie
about that, Javier?

We have your DNA.

All right, I've been
to Cynthia's house.

But I wasn't there to hurt her.

What, tying her up
and scaring her to death,

that was for what, for pleasure?

Yeah, I tied her up.
But not this morning.

And I swear it was consensual.

So you're having an affair.

You want proof, I got pictures.

Well, hey, that's a perfect
motive for killing your wife.

Look, I'm telling you.
I didn't kill Victoria.

Come on, man.
Our sex life was, uh...

But... but I loved her.

Don't even. Don't even.

I'm sorry.

You should be.

What's his story?

He says he was S&M buddies
with Cynthia Gilmore.

Victim of the home invasion?

Well, it doesn't

eliminate him
as a suspect in our shooting.

Yeah, well, we need proof.

Let's start by confirming
their relationship with Cynthia.

We won't have to.

He says he has pictures.

Pictures.

What are you thinking?

I just got an idea.

Is this everything?

I guess Peeping Pete
travels light.

You want to tell me why I got
all this stuff out of booking?

Voyeurs like to document,

so I'm thinking he might have
pictures of the spa crime scene.

Tripp says he checked this one.

It's not
a camera phone.

Wait a minute.

This is a pretty big pen

for a massage therapist
to carry around.

Is there a hole
in the side of it?

It has a lens.

Not that I'm not
enjoying these,

but this guy's gross.

Well, maybe
he can help us.

Whoa...

our guy did
get some shots.

The creep liked
skin and blood.

Okay, there's the guy
with the gun.

Let's compare him to the husband
of the dead girl.

It's gonna be kind of hard
with the mask on.

What about height?

Yeah, I could do that if
we have a reference point.

Okay, the thing
with the towel on it.

Nice, okay.

It's called a coat rack,
by the way.

Standard one is 5?feet.

So we just apply
that scale to our guy

and calculate
the difference.

No, five-foot-ten.

Morena's over six feet.
That excludes him.

Oh, hang on.

See something
that could help,

at least when
you do find the guy.

Guy's got a tattoo
on his wrist,

the hand holding
the gun.

Okay, print that out.

I'll give it to everyone.
Good eye.

Speaking of, what happened
at the chop shop, dude?

Heard you pulled
a Statue of Liberty.

Who told you that?

No, just thinking
it was funny,

'cause you told me
to hang back at the dock.

I told you, you didn't
have a weapon.

And I would have used one
if I had one.

You go out on one damn case,
you think you're Serpico?

Wolfe, I...

I didn't have a clean shot.
Okay? That's it.

Eric, what's going on?

Where's Marisol?

She's at
the hospital.

You're sure?
She's not answering

her cell phone and the alarm
just went off at her house.

Let's go.

Eric, check his pulse.

He's dead.

That tattoo.

It matches the one Ryan and
Cooper found on Pete's pictures.

This is the guy
that shot Victoria.

Put a gun in my sister's face.

You son of a bitch.

You know him?

His name's Greg Everest.

Questioned him
when we picked up Carvell.

Worked at the shop.
Came up clean.

Yeah, so the question is, Eric,
who killed him?

??

??

???

??

What do I do?

I want you to stay at my place
till this is over.

They won't look
for you there.

You've done so much for me.
You don't have to...

I think it would be
a good idea.

Are you sure?

Mm-hmm.

I am.

I'm going to have the officer
take you over there right now.

Officer.

Go ahead.

I can't believe
I let this guy go

at the car place.

Don't beat yourself up,
Calleigh.

The boy looks
like Charlie Brown.

It doesn't matter.

We're taught not to
pay attention to type.

You're also taught
to follow the evidence.

But he had a tattoo.

If I had looked
more closely, I
would've seen it.

It would've been
out of context if you had.

I hope you're right.

Of course I am, honey.

It's a .38.

Same type pulled
from Victoria Morena.

Yeah. I'd have to confirm it,

but I'd say it's possible
he was shot with his own gun.

Well, makes sense.

There are definite signs
of struggle on the body.

Really?
Yeah.

Besides the laceration,

he's got at least one
broken rib

and a nasty contusion.

That's a weird pattern.

Do you think somebody hit him
with something?

Or grabbed him.

That would mean that there
would've had to have been

something between their
hand and his skin.

Well, I can tell you

Greg wasn't wearing long sleeves
when I got to him.

Maybe our killer
was wearing gloves.

Would be enough
to leave a pattern.

So, what did
you and Alexx come up with?

There's a
patterned bruise

on Greg Everest's arm.

So what, you think, uh,
his killer was wearing gloves?

I'm comparing every
pair I could find.

These are close, but they'd
have to have stitching

across the fingers
to make this line.

Maybe stitching
didn't cause it.

Maybe our killer
wore gloves

that stop halfway
up the fingers.

Like weight-
lifting gloves?

Like driving gloves.

Hey, bring up the gloves
I got off Hayden.

He's our man.

I'll tell H.

Greg Everest sold you
a stolen car,

and you wanted him dead.

Look...

I studied business law
at Harvard for two years.

The judge is never going
to hold me on this.

Hayden, this is a criminal case.

( <i>laughs</i> ):
It's not going to matter.

Oh, yes, it will.

Do you know who my father is?

I hope he's a lawyer.

You're going to need one.

This is ridiculous.

I don't even own a gun.

And that's why you used Greg's.

Your own people said
they didn't find

any of that gun residue
stuff on my hands.

That's because you were wearing
driving gloves.

Prove it.

I'm going to.

We confiscated
this glove

when you got pulled over
in the Lamborghini.

Your glove matches
that bruise on Greg.

Okay.

I went to the
guy's work.

I watched him leave.

I followed him
to some house,

and we had an argument.

That car was hot.

Like you didn't know.

I want my money.

I don't have it.

Now get the hell out of here!

It was just
an argument.

I didn't kill anybody.

Drop the act, Hayden, okay?

Based on your education,

you should know we have enough
for a conviction.

( <i>sighs</i> )

He took off with 100
grand of my money.

Wouldn't you try
to get it back?

I suppose I would, but I don't
think I'd kill him over it.

I want my money.

Give it to me.

Listen, you rich little brat,
I'll give you something.

( <i>gunshot</i> )

I couldn't let him
get away with that.

Street punk like that
pulling a gun on someone

with my background?

Well, now, Hayden, you can add
"killer" to your resume.

Hey, we got our guy.
Good job with the Viper.

Thanks.

You, uh... you headed out?

Yeah.

Hey, Ryan, I promise I'm only
going to ask you this once,

but the... shooting...

had nothing to do
with your eye, did it?

I wish it did.

You know, when I first stared
patrol, I was on nights,

and then they moved me
to days,

and after about a year,
they put me back on nights.

I don't follow.

Well, in all my time on days,
I had lost my night eyes.

And I never said anything
to anyone about it

'cause I was scared.

I couldn't see.

You know it was broad daylight
this afternoon.

What I'm saying
is that sometimes...

change can throw you off.

You were on patrol.
You went into the lab.

It's easy to forget
how to be in the field.

Did you ever freeze?

Not yet...

but it could happen
to any of us at any time.

Thank you.

You'd do the same thing for me
if I were having a bad day.

See you later.

Marisol, you okay?

Why aren't you at home?

What's going on?

You know, it's funny.

I... I've been fighting
this... stupid cancer,

and... I don't know.

I guess I never really thought
about things.

Like what things?

Like what I'd be missing.

You know, this morning...

that woman, she was shot
right in front of me.

I don't know.
Sometimes I think...

I've been trying so hard
not to die

that I forget to live.

There's so much
that I-I've never done.

You know,
I've never traveled--

really traveled.

You can do
those things now.

I've never had a baby.

It's not too late.

What did you say?

I said it's not too late.

When you say that...

I believe you.

That's because it's true.
