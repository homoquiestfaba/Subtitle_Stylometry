[bang echoes]

They say a baby
can hear inside the womb.

So, all through
Laura's pregnancy,

I put my mouth
close to her belly

and spoke to Adam
inside her.

ATTORNEY: Were you in the
delivery room

when your son was born?

FATHER:
I was.

He was, uh, crying and, uh,

crying when they
handed him to me.

And when I spoke
to him, he stopped.

Opened his eyes.

Looked up at me.

It was the sound
of my voice.

He recognized it.

It was like
we knew each other already.

And when did
events begin to change

for you and your family?

Adam was eight.

Just before his birthday.

<i>The day started
at Adam's school.</i>

<i>We were a little late.</i>

We're going to be late.

You want to fly?

Ready for takeoff?

All right, here we go.


You got big.

All right, here we go!

[yelling playfully]

Whoo!

Whoa!

WOMAN: <i>
Hi, hello, everybody.</i>

<i>Okay, hello,
pay attention, everybody.</i>

Hi.

Are you ready?
It's magic time.

It's almost
about time to start.

Oh, but I must thank

the parents for their part
in the play.

Voicing for their children

while they're performing
this play.

And I want to thank
all of the moms

for making the costumes.


Don't our kids look great?

And a very special thank you
to my dear husband

for building the set for us.

Excuse me,

um, is it true that, that

when the play is over
we get to go home early?


No, no, it is,

but it's not time
for all that now.

Go. You're about
to go on.

Okay, places,
everybody.

[piano plays fanfare]

[imitating wind blowing]

Auntie Em!

Auntie Em, it's a twister!

It's heading right towards us.

Dorothy, get in
the storm cellar now,

before it's too late!

Auntie Em!

Auntie Em, where are you?

Auntie Em,
where are you?

Where are you?

Where am I?

Your house fell
on the wicked witch.

And killed her.

Now, you're wearing
her magic shoes.

I am going
to the Great Oz,

to ask him if he can
send me back home

-to Kansas.
-And ask him

if he can give me a heart.

And ask him to give
me some brains.



Do you think the Great Oz

could give me
some courage?


Why don't you come
with us and find out?

You'd be so very welcome.

Are you ready?

ALL:
Let's go!

[piano playing jaunty melody]


He's, he's turning eight.

Yeah, we're going
to have the, uh,

the party right here
in our backyard.

So, I'm going to need you
in your full pirate regalia,

you know, games, magic,
balloon animals, you name it.

How much is that
going to cost me?

You're kidding.

How about for a, a couple of
parrot hand puppet things?

Something... Yeah.

Okay, all right, fine.
And also,

by the way, this is not

your typical
birthday party; Adam...

Hold on a minute.
Adam!


[tires screeching]


Hey.

Hey...

You're going
to be okay.

The doctor is going to
make it all better.

So how did this happen?

Oh, he was,
he was chasing a balloon.

I yelled out,
like an idiot,

but...

Was Adam born deaf?

No, he was
born hearing.

And when did it
start to go?

Uh, a couple years ago.

And he doesn't use
a hearing aid?

No. They stopped

helping.

Well, that must have required
quite an adjustment.

I've accepted it.

Uh, I meant him.

His mother is,
uh, deaf.

She teaches deaf children.

Mommy taught you to sign, right?

Yeah, Mommy gave me
magic hands! Yes.

What about his speech?

Uh, he doesn't speak
anymore.

I mean, he used
to say stuff to me,

but then when he went
totally deaf, he just...

What's that?

It means
he turned off his voice.

Okay, that should do it.

All done.

You know, he may
turn it back on,

if he could hear
himself speak.

Well, we can't reverse
what nature's done.

Well, sometimes we can.

Have you ever heard of
a cochlear implant?

You do realize your son
could hear sound again.

-Excuse me. -Well, not-not like
a hearing child, but thanks.

Some sound in hearing is
better than none, right?

I mean, if his heart
were defective,

you wouldn't question
implanting

an artificial valve.

Well, the deaf don't see
themselves as defective.

That's the point.

I've been married to
a deaf woman for nine years.

Nothing about her is defective.

Trust me.

Oh!

Oh, you won!

Good job!

All right, here is the
Hudson Ear Institute.

Dr. Flynt.

-He could help you.
-Hey.

Come on, let's go.
Uh, thanks anyway.

Well, it's just information.

Information can't hurt you.

We don't want someone
sticking wires in his head.

It's not an option.

No way.

Adam...

Okay.

Uh, don't...

...worry.

See... you...

at... home.

Yeah. Mommy.

[clicks tongue]

Hey, hey.


Oh.

Oh!

Don't. I'm driving.

[children shouting playfully]

Oh.

Sorry.

I got here
as fast as I could.

He's taking a nap.

-What did the doctor say?
-No. No.

He said he's fine.

He's a normal kid.


WOMAN: Here you are,
Mr. Donner.

That's quite a development.

-Ah, thank you very much.
-Mm-hmm.

[phone ringing]

WOMAN:
Krupp, Harrison & Dean.

He's not in the
office today.

[indistinct conversations]


Mr. Donner, thank you
for pushing the meeting.

I'm sorry.
Something at home.

Nothing too
serious, I hope.

No, no. Nothing
serious at all.

Uh, while we
were waiting,

your lovely assistant
was explaining

this video
phone to me.

Oh, yeah, that-that's
pretty cool, isn't it?

Mm-hmm.

My wife and I can
see each other

and sign over the phone.

Uh, she's deaf, and my son
is deaf, too, so, uh...

-Mm.
-Have a seat. Have a seat.

Thanks.

So, what did you think
of our proposal?

Impressive,
but I should warn you,

our company is set in its ways.

Well, I don't want
to change anything, but...

You know, to me,

public relations is
about perception.

My job is to recognize

what it is about you
that makes you unique.

You know, special.

[children laughing]

MAN: What-What this
time, McBain?

Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Can I borrow Mr. Williams
for a moment?

Oh, sure, absolutely.

I want you to meet
my husband, Ray.

Ray, this is
Laura's father Max.

I read your book
on deaf culture.

It's very good.

I learned a lot.

Ah, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

[Jennifer chuckles]

Laura, you must be very
proud of your father.

Oh... ho, ho.

He means the world to me.

I'm proud of you, too.

Is your mom here?

[children laughing]

-Oh.
-[laughs]

-Told you, honey.
-He's having a ball.

DAN:
Ah, there goes... Okay.

Yeah. Oh, oh.
Oh, I... Let me get the...

My parents are here.

Let me get them over.

-Mom! Dad! Oh, you made it.
-Hi.

-Oh, good to see you.
-How you doin', big fella?

Yes, you, too, honey.

-Thank you for coming.
-How are you?

-Oh, how was your flight?
-The movie was good.

FATHER:
The pretzels were bad.

Yeah. Ah, well.

Hey, here's the birthday boy!

Oh, my darling.

-How are you, sweetheart?
-How you doing, Adam?

-How are you, big boy?
-Happy birthday.

Hey, you look great.

Where should I put that...?

-Oh, another present.
-Ah, you know.

Oh, my goodness!
Mount Vesuvius erupts.

-Yes...
-Hey, come on over.

You remember the, uh, Scotts,
live across the street?

Yes, of course.
How are you? Hi.

-My parents.
-Nice to see you.

Good to see you again.
I'm Priscilla. Priscilla.

-I'll get you guys some drinks.
-Priscilla? You?

EVERYONE:
â™ª Happy birthday to you

â™ª Happy birthday
to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday, dear Adam

â™ª Happy birthday to you.

[no audio]

DAN:
Oh. Wait.

You have to make a wish.

"Tell me. Tell me."
Well, for what?

What do I wish for?


DAN [echoing]: <i>
...wish for?</i>

[laughter echoing]

Great party.

Don't you think?

Adam had such a good time.

The cut on his knee
didn't bother him a bit.

Yeah. Chasing that balloon--
that's all he was doing.

Oh, he's all right.

Yeah, well...

what if, next time,
he's chasing the balloon,

and it leads him out
into traffic?

Deaf kids don't walk
into traffic.

You never see on the news,

"Deaf child wanders aimlessly
into traffic."

It doesn't happen.

What if we were given the chance

to change the direction
of his life?

The ER doctor suggested

that-that
we can actually choose.

Choose what?

Whether Adam should have a...

cochlear implant.


The doctor said
that Adam is a good candidate.

The younger he is,

the more effective
the implant will be.

He may still remember
what things sound like.


I can't believe you'd even...

No, I-I...

I told the doctor no.

Good.

Then I checked the Internet.

Implants now have
16-channel sound.

I mean, they're powered
by a computer microchip.

Wait. Are you actually
considering this?

There's this doctor-- Dr. Flynt.

Let's at least go see him.

I mean, how can we, um,

make an intelligent decision

if we don't have all the facts?

But we know all this already.

You and I talked.

We always agreed.

Why are you suddenly...?

Because what if,

what if our boy
could hear again?

Adam's happy the way he is.

I know, but...

And you and I have always
told Adam to love who he is.

Now you want to tell him

something's wrong
with him? Why?

To maybe give him back
one of the basic human senses

that nature wants
all of us to have.

But that is what nature wants.

Nature did it!

Being deaf

is as natural to Adam and me
as being hearing is to you.


Let's go meet this doctor, okay?

Next week.

Friday.

Friday?

Yeah. At 3:45.

You made an appointment
without even asking me?

These doctors are so busy.

I mean, you...
you have to grab them

when you...

What?

You're scaring me.

Don't be scared.

You've already
made up your mind.

No.

I'm keeping my mind open.

Can you?

So, Ms. Kramer, why don't you

tell the court a little
about Pinewood?

Well, Pinewood has been
there for 70 years.

We are the only deaf
elementary school in the county.

Please tell the
court, Ms. Kramer,

do any of the children
at your school

have a cochlear implant?

No.

The policy at our school
is that all our kids sign.

And when you see a child

with an implant, how do you

personally feel?

My heart breaks.

And why is that?

Well, 100 years ago,
we would take deaf people

and slice out the bottom
of their tongues

to <i>loosen</i> their tongues.

We thought that

it would make them
speak like us.

Today,

they drill holes
in their skulls.

Objection.
Unwarranted comparison,

Your Honor, and irrelevant
to these proceedings.

I agree.

Sustained.

Could you maybe
clarify your point

for the court, Ms. Kramer?

What I'm trying to say is,

I am around deaf kids
and their families

every day at our school.

We don't look at deafness

as a handicap
that needs to be corrected.

Why do we feel this need
to make them speak like us?

They speak with their hands.

You're a deaf mother,
Mrs. Parks?

Yes, I have a daughter.

She's seven.

Wait a minute.
You're deaf.

I notice you're not
utilizing the services

of the sign language
interpreter.

I don't need one.

I can hear everything
you're saying.

But how is that possible?

I have a cochlear implant.

Wow.
And, uh, is your daughter deaf?

Yes. We got her implant
two years ago.

As a deaf parent,
was that a hard decision

for you to make?

MRS. PARKS:
We're still a deaf family.

We have a lot
of deaf friends.

We did get some pressure
not to do it,

but then I got mine,

and there was no
question in my mind.

And you feel
that giving your child

an implant has improved
the quality of her life?

MRS. PARKS:
She hears music, cars...

She can talk to anybody
anytime.

She won't ever feel left out
of anything anymore.

It's a miracle.

Let me remind both parties.

The purpose of
these proceedings is not

for the court to decide
whether the minor

should receive an implant.

This is a custody hearing.

DAN [on recording]:
Well, Adam, tell Daddy

how old you are today.

ADAM:
Three!

DAN:
Three! That's right!

Good boy. You're a big boy now.

ADAM:
Yeah.

DAN:
Can you sing the alphabet song?

ADAM:
Yeah, yeah.

â™ª A-B-C-D-E-F-G

â™ª H-I

â™ª J-K-L-M-N-O-P

â™ª Q-R-S

â™ª T-U-V

Hey.

-â™ª W-X
-Hey.

-â™ª Y and Z
-Let's clean up

the room, you know,
before Grandma sees it.

Okay? All right, uh...

-â™ª Now I know my ABCs
-Here.

Ooh!

â™ª Won't you come
and sing with me? â™ª

[Dan and Adam talking
indistinctly on tape]

You ready?

Uh, yeah, ready, yeah.

[indistinct talking on tape
continues]

Now, mind Grandma Sally,
and go to bed

when she tells you to.

Daddy and I will be home
after the movie, okay?

ADAM:
â™ª Wonder what you are

-â™ª Up above the world so high
-[sighs]

â™ª Like a diamond

[full volume]:
â™ª In the sky

â™ª Twinkle, twinkle,
little star â™ª

â™ª How I wonder what you are.

[switch clicks]

I'm glad you came in.

It gives me a chance
to say how sorry I am

I had to lie to you.

BURT LANCASTER:
So, you see, Edna,

I could never
satisfy your need.

And I know that you
could never satisfy mine.

I would never try to again.

-[laughter]
-Hello. Four of you?

I've heard that joke
so many times.

-Okay. Right through there.
-I've never heard it.

I've never heard
you tell that.

I love the way
they worked out the captions

so that she can enjoy
the movie more.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, it's great now. Yeah.

Was it always
that way, or?

Uh, no actually, no.

No, it wasn't.

Uh, in fact, uh...
Laura, remember

when we were first dating,

and we would go
to the movies?

This is before captions,
right?

So we would go
to the movies,

and to impress her,

to show her how cool
I was, right?

I would scrunch down
in my seat, real low, like...

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

...and, uh, um, scrunch down
in my seat real low, like this,

and I would be frantically
trying to secretly sign

the whole movie,

you know,
without being seen.

It was... Right?

And remember that,
the one time

that the usher came over

because he thought
you were having a seizure.


Yes, it's true.

Smooth, Dan,
you're a real Don Juan.

Oh, yeah, yeah...

How could you even hold up
a fork at dinner

after signing
an entire movie?

Um...?

You should have seen him

when we saw <i>
War and Peace.</i>


You didn't know how to sign

before you met Laura,
did you?

Um...

No, no.

But as soon as I laid eyes
on her,

I knew I wanted to speak
her language.

What?
I speak your language.

I just don't understand
what you're saying.

-Thanks a lot.
-Ow!

FEMALE VOCALIST [over radio]:
â™ª It's not the pale moon

â™ª That excites me

â™ª That thrills

â™ª And delights me...

Come here, come here.

â™ª Oh, no

â™ª It's just the nearness

â™ª Of you

â™ª It isn't your sweet
conversation â™ª

â™ª That brings...

It's our song.

â™ª Oh, no

â™ª It's just the nearness

â™ª Of you

â™ª When you're in my arms

â™ª And I feel you...

Hey, you know what?

There was an outfielder
for the Cincinnati Reds.

He threw out three runners
at home plate,

all the way
from the outfield,

in the same game!

Wow!

And he stole
so many bases,

he is still on the top-20 list
of all time.

Know what else was
special about him?

He was deaf.

Only trouble was,
he couldn't hear

the umpire call out
balls or strikes.

Watch.

Know what they did?

Hand signals, sign language.

And they still do it
to this day.

What did he say?

Nothing.

He just stared at me,

like I was a raving lunatic.


You should've seen me
trying to order this latte.

I said, "Yes, whipped cream."

Whip... cream!


Oh...

Mom, have you ever had
to stand up against Daddy?

Tell him he's wrong?

There were a few times
in our marriage

when I wish I had.

When?

Oh... those are nice.

That watch would look good
on your father, don't you think?

Easy. Slow it down.

Am I throwing too hard?

Sorry.

You know what Grandpa said
about hand signals is true.

And when a player

strikes out, the umpire
also yells, real loud,

"You're out!"

Good, but just, just...
try it...

Use your voice,
just big and loud.

Just... You're out!

[no audio]

It's okay. Um...

Just use your voice.

You're out!

[no audio]


There was a deaf pitcher
for the New York Giants,

pitched eight years,

including the World Series...

And reminder:

staff meeting tomorrow
is moved to 11:00.

Are you okay?

I'm fine.

Anything you want to talk about?

-Well...
-[door opens]

Hold on a sec, 'kay?

Hey, stop that!

We're having dinner soon.

Go wash up.

Dinner!

My pot roast is ready.

Oh, bye.

This competition thing
with your father--

it's gone too far.

[stamps foot]

Competition thing?

Your father, look...

I respect what he's done
with his life,

but from the beginning,
he has never accepted me.

No, he's accepted you.

No, no, no. He...

he tolerates me, barely.

His daughter marrying
a hearing man...


Deaf pride, that's one thing,

deaf prejudice, that's another.

Not true.

You're wrong.

Well, don't underestimate
prejudice.


FEMALE ATTORNEY: So ASL is just
a kind of English, right?

Uh, American Sign Language
is not English.

No? Isn't sign language just
making English with your hands?

No, it is its own

official language
unto itself.

The average hearing person
has no idea

how complex
sign language can be.

Dr. Cannon, as a professor
with a PhD in linguistics,

would you agree that
language creates culture?

CANNON: It's a standard we use
to define any culture

around the world.

ATTORNEY: So, since ASL is
an official language,

does that mean that
deafness is a culture?

Their language <i>
is</i> their culture;

their sense of self as a people,

their history, traditions,
dignity, power--

all of it.

It's all carried forward
and lives in their hands.

Dr. Harvey, what does
the future hold for Adam

as a deaf child?

Well, the, uh,

according to the data available,

the average deaf person
in this country

leaves high school reading at
the level of a fourth-grader.

Objection.
Is counsel suggesting

that deaf people
can't read?

That's absurd.

The average hearing American
graduates high school

reading at the level
of a fifth-grader.

Your Honor, the data reflects
the national average.

Miss Tate will have her
opportunity to challenge

these findings on
cross-examination.

Take a seat, Mrs. Tate.

Wait your turn.

What if Adam wants to go to
college, get a degree?

He would need a sign language
interpreter with him

all the time in the classroom.

And if Adam somehow manages
to get a deaf education,

what kind of livelihood
can he expect?

The average deaf adult
earns far below

the national standard.

A large percentage
of deaf adults

receive government subsidies,

um, disability insurance.

Wait a minute.

How is it that a deaf person
can accept a disability

insurance check
with one hand,

and yet claim they're
not disabled

but a culture
with the other?

Objection! Misleading and
grossly prejudicial.

Sustained.

I withdraw it.

Dr. Harvey, as a professor
of sociology,

would you agree that when Adam
Miller's hearing disappeared

at age four,

so did many of
his life's options

and opportunities?

In my opinion, that would be
a true statement-- yes.

GRISHAM:
Thank you.

Hey, what's going on?

I thought maybe I
could work from home,

you know, in the
afternoons, for a while.

I... I told the office
that I'd be working, uh,

you know, half days.

Why?

You know, to have time with you

and with Adam.

Adam developed deafness,
not cancer.

[children laughing]

LAURA: He's making
appointments,

making decisions, without
even asking me.

That's so not like us.

Ray will do the same
thing sometime.

Men, they don't think
it matters.

Dan and I always talk.

About everything.

Together.

Especially about Adam.

That's why I feel so...

I don't know.

Do you and Ray talk
about everything?

Sometimes I think

that Ray would talk
to his best friend

about things
that he doesn't say to me.

Dan and I have always said...

-"I married my best friend."
-Mmm.

So, if that's the case,

what are you going to do?

LAURA:
I don't know.

Hi.

Do you remember sound?

Some things.

What do you remember?

Do you miss hearing things?

When you think of sound,

do you wish you could
hear things again?

I'm full. Done.

I wonder if, maybe,
it would've been easier

if he'd never
heard sound before.

If he'd

been born deaf like me.

Easier?

For whom?

I remember the first time

I understood there was sound
in the world.

I was a little girl.

My grandmother was hearing.

<i>She was outside
sweeping the porch.</i>

[teakettle whistling]

[whistling fades]

[whistling stops abruptly;
no audio]

[whistling resumes]

[no audio]

<i>And I remember
that's when I realized</i>

that's sound.

[under breath]:
Wow.

[no audio]

I'm supposed to know
what's right for him.

You do know.

Do I?

FLYNT: <i>
Uh, your parents</i>

are, um, hearing impaired?

Oh, they're deaf.

Well, you see, um, um,

usually, I, um...

Okay, my signing isn't
what it used to be.

Oh, I'll interpret.

Thank you.

You see, most
of the parents I see

about implants are hearing.

Uh, 90% of deaf kids
have hearing parents.

Well, when I was born deaf,

my parents celebrated.

Especially my father.
See, he's

he's big on Deaf Pride

and deaf culture.

He even wrote a
book about it.

If he knew I was here...

I... I know, I know.

FLYNT:
More and more

deaf parents are
getting implants

for their children,
if that, uh, helps you.

That makes me sad.

Well, we're just,
we're just here

to get information,
that's all.

Tell me about the surgery.

The surgeon drills a hole
through the skull,

into the chamber
of the inner ear.

And then he inserts the
electrodes through the hole,

into the cochlea.

Takes three to five weeks
for the incision to heal.

And then there's
an external transmitter

that, uh, attaches by magnet.

Then he can hear?

Not yet.

Well, how long before
he gets his hearing back?

You do understand that
implants don't cure deafness.

When he removes
the device,

he's still a deaf child.

So... what?

Is he a... a deaf child
who hears?

Or is he a hearing child
who's deaf?

No...

he's, he's our son.

No, he's too young.

He just turned eight.

-I know.
-Actually,

it's, it's, um, easier

for a child whose brain
is still developing

to learn to process
different sounds.

We find that the younger
the child is

the better the results we see.

We've implanted kids
as young as 12 months.

I'm trying to keep an open mind,

I really am.

That's why it's very important
for both of you

to understand what implants can
and cannot do.

Come with me.

<i>I want you to see something.</i>

WOMAN:
David...

I'm going to put
this on your ear.

And then I'll start this,

and if you hear anything,

you tell me, okay?

I scheduled your appointment so
you could see this.

See? It's the same.

I'm going to activate
the implant.

Now, the hearing aid only
amplifies the sound.

Makes it louder.

With an implant, 16 electrodes
are surgically inserted into

-the inner ear. -It will just
take a second, okay?

Now, that's
the processor,

attached to his ear there.

That sends the
sound impulses

to the implant,

which turns them into
electronic signals.

And they are sent
directly to the brain.

The whole thing runs
on a rechargeable battery.

[over speaker]:
Are you ready?

Okay, go ahead.

David?

David?

Is he hearing me?

It's okay; keep trying.

David?

David.

Try again.

David.

MOTHER:

David?

Oh, darling.

Hey.

Can you hear me?
Huh?

Can...
can he hear me?

He can't tell
it's your voice,

but he is responding
to the sound.

[under breath]:
Wow.

FLYNT: <i>
Now, it'll, uh, take some time</i>

to retrain Adam's brain
to receive sound again.

And then he'll need
speech therapy.

Well, uh, maybe
at Adam's school, we can...

Oh, Adam would have
to change schools.

...schools.

Why?

Well, with an implant, he'll be
going to a mainstream school

to learn how to listen
and speak.

What about his signing?

Oh, that would become
his second language.

And, with time,

Adam will be able
to sign at home,

and speak and hear
in the outside world.

Switch back and forth.

But he won't feel part
of the hearing world

because he'll never hear
what the other kids hear.

And he won't feel part

of the deaf world,
because he'll never

be totally deaf.

Well, I think you'll find

that Adam will have
the best of both worlds.

And what do you say?

What do you say
when Adam says,

"Daddy, why?

"Why are you doing
this to me?

-Could you... -"Is there
something wrong with being deaf?

No...
-"I don't get it.

Tell me, tell me."

-What are you going to tell him?
-No... what,

what do, what do I say, when he
looks up at me and he says,

"You had the chance to
get my hearing back

and you did nothing"?

What do I say then?

Oh, I, I know.

"Sorry, it wasn't
politically correct."

Wait, you...

Folks, if you decide to go
through with this,

what we do is we assign
a psychologist to your case.

It's routine.

Well, Adam doesn't
need a shrink.

Well, no, this is to evaluate
the two of you as a couple.

This is a life choice,

that you're making
for your family.

For it to work you both have
to be in complete agreement.

And if we're not?

Then don't do it.

[steam cleaner hissing]

[no audio]

[muffled whistling]

[no audio]

BOY: Star Command to
Night Warrior.

Come in,
Night Warrior

Do you read me?

Uh-oh! An alien creature!

Blast him!
Blast him!

Blam! Blam! Blam!

Blam.

Hey, cut it out.

He's an alien.

He can play with us.

Talks like this...

-Look at me, I'm "death,"
I'm "death." -Stop it!

Look at me, I'm "death,"
I'm "death."

Stop it!

Get off me!

Mark, stop that!

Get off of him!

What...? Come here!

What is going on?

Come here.

What has gotten into you?

-He was making fun of Adam.
-Oh...

Say you're sorry, Todd.

No.

Say you're sorry!

I think that's a good idea.
Say you're sorry.

Todd?!

How do you say...

[over-enunciates]:
"I'm... sorry"?

Todd!

I'm sorry.

I'm, uh... I'm trying to help
the guys at the office

with the King account.

They can't seem to do
anything without me.

So, you went through
my briefcase?

Adam was drawing
a picture.

He likes those
colored pens of yours.

Yes. We're set with
the psychologist

to be evaluated
as a couple.

So, we are going ahead.

For now.

And when did "we" decide that?

I was going to show you.

Oh, I see.

Evaluation as...

a couple.

Mrs. Miller, would you say
you're a close family?

Yes.

You enjoy being
a grandmother?

Oh, I love it.

I adore Adam.

He's my pride and joy.

That's why I just
don't understand...

You don't understand what?

What mother,
if given the chance,

would deny her child the ability
to hear, to speak?

-Uh, Mrs. Miller, could you wait
until...? -If it were my child,

I would do anything
to help him.

TATE: But isn't it true that if
Adam were in this courtroom

today, you, as his grandmother,

would be unable to
communicate with him?

To tell him
that you love him?

He knows that I love him.

I tell him all the time.

But how?

You don't speak
the same language.

I hold him, I hug him.

He sees it in my face.

It's beyond words.

It doesn't matter
what language we speak.

TATE:
No further questions.

Let me ask you this--

if your own daughter Laura
were hearing,

would you love her
any less?

Of course not.

A mother loves her child,
no matter what.

So the fact that she is deaf is
actually irrelevant, isn't it?

And gives her no advantage,
pro or con, as a mother,

isn't that what
you're saying?

Objection. Leading.

Seeking clarification,
Your Honor.

I'll allow it.

What I'm saying is,
my daughter and I

share a deep bond.

We're both mothers.

There is no word for it,
no sign.

It's a woman's love
of her child.

It connects Adam to
Laura, her to me...

all of us, all women

into a vast network

much more important
than any Internet.

What about Dan?

Can't a man, a father,
deaf or hearing,

have the same connection

with his child?

Dan is a wonderful father.

I know that he loves

Adam deeply.

That they share a deep
bond of their own.

But I also know that there
are many deaf people

for whom the implant
was not successful.

Dan needs to know that with
or without the implant,

Adam will always be deaf,

and he must never be
denied his sign language.

What is Deaf Pride?

Dignity, self-respect.

Can someone who
acquires deafness,

is not born deaf,
have Deaf Pride?

Well...

no, it's not the same.

How so?

Being born deaf gives you what?

A deeper understanding,
appreciation of the deaf world.

GRISHAM:
So, are you saying

there are two worlds--
one for the hearing,

-one for the deaf?
-Yes.

GRISHAM: But isn't it true that
the only difference

between a deaf
and hearing person

is that one hears
and the other doesn't?

-Otherwise they are entirely the
same? -No, it's more than that.

As I explained in my book,

we are a minority
in this country--

with a culture.

And like other minorities,

we have some
painful history.

Discrimination, prejudice,
lack of opportunity.

All we want is to be ourselves,

be perceived as people

and to celebrate who we are.

But wouldn't life be easier
for you if you could hear?

The majority always thinks
each minority

wants to be like them.

Most hearing people
think that a deaf person,

if given a chance, would rather
be hearing than deaf.

Not true.

Not for me.

I know who I am.

I have my people,
I have my language,

I have my culture--
my identity.

Let me be.

As my wife says,

God made all of us different

for a reason.

Yeah.
Happy Thanksgiving to all.

Dah-dee.

Dah-dee.

Uh, yes, what...

what is it?

Potatoes? Yeah.

Thank you.

Thank you, Daddy.

You're...

you're welcome.

[phone ringing]

Oh, my, uh... phone.
Ringing.

[door closes]

When did that start--
Adam speaking?

Stop it.

What is going on?

Something is wrong
with you and Dan.

What is it?

Dan... he and I think
we should...

Are you two planning
to separate?

No, no.

Dan thinks we should...

...explore the idea of
getting Adam an implant.

No, Mom, we just finished.

I wish you and Dad were here.

You won't believe, what...

Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

It's Grandma.

She wants to talk to you.

Okay? All right.

Use your voice.

You sounded great.

And it would make her
very, very happy, so...

Say, "Hello, Grandma.

Happy Thanksgiving," okay?

Here.

No...

Adam, just use your voice.

Please.

Okay. [laughs softly]

He says, "Hi, Grandma.
Happy Thanksgiving."

Yeah. Yeah.

She says,
"Happy Thanksgiving

to you, too."

Ah.

Did you eat a lot of turkey?

You would never

stick an implant
in our grandson.

You know that I love him
the way he is.

But I'm just so afraid--

what if I'm holding
him back in some way?

Holding him back?!

Has being deaf held me back?

No, of course not!

When I was his age,

I was the only deaf kid
in the entire town.

I was made fun of,
I was beat up.

-I was alone.
-She knows.

Nobody ever signed
to me. Nobody.

My father told me
to talk like he did.

He'd tie my hands together
and lock me in a closet

to keep me from signing.

Yes, yes, it was awful.

-She knows.
-My father wanted

my deafness to go away.

Like these implants.

Wipe us out. No more deaf.

She has to figure out
what's best for her son.

You can't force
your experience on her.

You're a deaf mother
with a deaf son!

I'm his mother first.

You are deaf first!

And Dan is still his father.

Dan is ashamed
of his own son!

-And his wife?
-Stop it, both of you!

Dan loves me for my heart,
not my ears.

I am Dan's wife--

-not his deaf wife, his wife.
-I see different.

What do you see, that Dan
doesn't love me anymore?

Dan thinks we're
handicapped, <i>disabled.</i>

-What?! -No. The truth is, <i>
you</i> think that...

about yourself!

Come on, let's go.

You're a proud man
and I love you,

but you live too much

with a capital "D."

Deaf way or no way.

You see yourself
as a deaf man

instead of just a man.

End of subject! Finished!

You were born deaf.

You have a responsibility

to pass on our culture.

"Born deaf"! "Born deaf"!

As if that made
me <i>more</i> deaf!

[door slams]

It's time for all
of this to stop.

Tell her.

You...

You were born hearing.

You were the most beautiful baby
I had ever seen.

Is that true?

On the morning you were born,

I...

I walked into the hospital room.

Your mother held you,
wrapped in a pink blanket.

I stood behind you and...

And we knew.

And you were disappointed.

I was upset, said some things,

scared your mother.

I was relieved

when your hearing
finally went away.


Before then, you were
very hard of hearing.

Without hearing aids,
you heard very little.

A loud noise,
door slam, a siren.

A teakettle.


What?

You never gave me hearing aids.

Why?

So you could say
I was born deaf?

We did what we felt was best

for our daughter.

You couldn't accept me as I was.

Is everyone mad at me?

No. No.

Nobody's mad at you.

I'm very proud of you.

[laughs gently]

Okay.

This is the story
of... Pinocchio.

All right.

"Once upon a time,
there was a woodcutter.

"Now, he was very lonely.

"Now, what this old man wanted
more than anything in the world

"was a son.

"But instead,

"he only had a puppet.

"So, this lonely...

"...this lonely man pretended
that the puppet was a real boy."

[car engine starts outside]

DAN:
So...

you were born hearing?

I... saw.

That was a private conversation.

I was worried about you.

Don't walk away from me.

I love you, all right?

I'm... I-I am not
the big bad hearing man.

Oh! Deaf, hearing,
deaf, hearing!

I'm sick of it! All of it!

-Laura...
-[angry grunt]

Laura, look...
look at me, look at me.

No! No!

-Leave me alone! Don't touch me!
-Laura!

Everybody, leave me alone!

Laura, stop.

-Stop, stop.
-[cries]

Stop. Stop.

-[groaning, crying]
-Stop.

Stop it.

-[sobbing]
-Stop it, stop.

It's all right.

It's okay, it's okay.


[slow, gentle theme playing]

What's that?

A robot.

A robot? Mm-hmm.

Good one.

Thanks.

Your father wants you to know
that he loves you very much.

I know he does.

[doorbell rings]

SALLY:
You have to understand

that it isn't
easy for him.

Mom, can I go out and play?

Mm-hmm. That's fine.

Let me take a look.

What do I do about Adam?

About my husband?

When your father and I
were first married...

Your marriage and mine,
your era and mine

were worlds apart.

SALLY:
Perhaps.

I teach deaf kids,

but I had never seen a child
slowly go deaf over time

until it happened
to my son.

It happened to my daughter.


He would stand right
here in this room

and turn up the TV set
louder and louder...

and still not hear it,

and then look to me.

It can be heartbreaking.

The deaf part of me said,

"Don't worry, Adam, there's
nothing wrong with you."

That's right.

But...

the mother part of me

was saying, "My little boy
is scared and confused,

and I can't help him."


Well, maybe now I can.

You have choices today
I never had to face.

If you had a choice with me,
what would you have done?


You are what
you are meant to be.

You're a teacher.

What is the lesson
you want to give your son?

[phone beeps]

Excuse me, Dr. Walter,
I can't get a...

I was just saying,
I-I can't get a...

Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

You're-you're deaf?

Hard-of-hearing.

Oh, uh, no one told me.

One partner in your marriage
is deaf.

That's why I've been
assigned to your case.

Please, have a seat.

Uh, do you want some coffee?

No, thank you.

Being hard-of-hearing and deaf
are two different things.

Yes.

I think I heard that
from somewhere.

So, you were saying...?

Yeah, I-I can't get a signal
in this area for s...

Has... My wife--
has she called you yet?

No. No, she hasn't.

Well... she's late.
I don't know where she is.

You're here.

Yes, I'm here.

But I think the whole point
was for you

to assess Laura and me

-as a couple.
-That's right.

Well, I hate to point out the
obvious, but Laura's not here.

That's right.

And if she's not here,

then she can't tell us how
she feels about the implant.

I think she is telling us how
she feels about the implant.

I hate to point out
the obvious.

Is this typical of Laura?

Not calling?
Not showing up?

No.

Then why is she doing it now?

I want to focus on Adam,

not make this about her.

He's her son.

Yeah, well, he's my son, too.

I mean, what am I?

Am I the "evil hearing father"

because, you know, I want my kid
to, you know, hear again?

No, of course not.

Thank you.

But know what?

Debating on the pros and cons

of getting an implant
is not my job.

-It doesn't interest me.
-Oh.

Well, what does interest you?

You.

You interest me.

[scoffing laugh]


Talk with your wife,

and we'll arrange another time.

I don't think
I have any more time.

May I ask you a question?

Of course.

That's why I'm here.

When Laura and I got married,

we wanted to have a baby
real bad.

I knew when Adam was conceived,
it was beautiful.

I mean, I-I-I-I knew.

I knew we were making our baby.

That's a nice thing to remember.

No, it's not.

Because when I was holding Laura
in my arms...

all I could think about was...

please...
make us a hearing baby.

Does... does that make me bad?

It's late.

Adam sleeping?

Yeah. He kept asking me,
"Where's Daddy?"

I met with the, uh,
therapist today.

We had, uh, had
that appointment, remember?

I was worried
that something had happened.

Something did happen.

Did you explain to Adam

why Mommy not only
didn't show up

at her 3:45 appointment
with the therapist

and with Daddy,
but didn't even call?

I tried calling.

I tried texting.

But it-it wouldn't send.

It just said, "Signal failure."

Well, I couldn't get a signal
in that building, so...

So I tried to reach
the receptionist.

I typed a message but stopped.

Mm-hmm.

The words I typed on my screen
were there:

"Can you find my husband?"

Where have you gone?

One plus one makes two.

I teach math,

-don't forget.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

One plus one...

-makes two?
-Adam and I.

If there's something wrong
with Adam,

then there's something wrong
with me.

And I don't know
when that happened.

When did that happen?

When did that happen?!

That I became disabled?!
To you?!

Dis-abled!

Not able!

To what,
be your wife, your lover?!

Carry on a conversation--
what?! What happened?!

You can't have a conversation
with anyone without me,

can you?!

Without me having
to interpret everything for you

back and forth,
back and forth!

God gave me a hearing son

and then He let me
fall in love with him.

And then, then He...

[Laura crying, sniffling]

God gave me a hearing son

and then took him
away from me.

And now, I see him
sitting with you,

just signing away, and I think
to myself, "No, it's not fair.

He was mine!"

He's ours!

I want my son back!

We were a family.

So much has happened
since Adam's birthday.

My wife and I
are, you know, here...

legally separated.

Your Honor,

please, just give me my son.

Are you currently employed,
Mr. Miller?

I work at Krupp, Harrison
& Dean.

It's one of the biggest
PR firms in the city.

And how does your salary compare
to that of your wife?

I make more than three times
her salary, and next year

they're going to make me
senior vice president.

Your Honor, submitted
are financial statements

of Mr. Miller's
current holdings,

as well as projection
reports of future earnings.

It includes a financial
portfolio Mr. Miller has created

to fund Adam's future care
and education.

Does it also include the cost
of getting a cochlear implant?

Objection!

Sustained. Out of line.
I'm warning you.

GRISHAM:
Mr. Miller,

are you willing
and able to undertake

the financial responsibility
of raising a child,

as well as alimony payments
to your wife,

should your separation
become final?

I'll provide Adam
with whatever he needs

and help Laura any way I can.

Mr. Miller...

do you love your son?

Uh, more than anything
in the world.

Does he seem any less to you,
now that he is deaf?

[clears throat]
Absolutely not.

He's my son.

I want my son.

GRISHAM:
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

No further questions.

Mr. Miller, if you retain
custody of your son,

will you give him
a cochlear implant?

Objection!

The question is hypothetical

and asks the witness
to theorize on future events.

Your Honor, the question
is no more hypothetical

than a report
of projected earnings.

Mr. Miller could lose
his job tomorrow.

The question is fundamental

to the child's future
under care of this witness.

I'll allow it, but... remember,
this is a custody hearing.

It's not a legal debate
about implants.

The witness will answer.

Mr. Miller, I'll ask you again.

If you receive
custody of your son,

will you give him
a cochlear implant?

[clears throat]

He'll never hear
Mozart again.

-Or the Beatles.
-Yes or no?

Or Beethoven.

Beethoven was deaf, Mr. Miller.

Or the crack of a baseball bat

-in a major league ballpark.
-Yes or no?

I want my son
to hear those things.

Yes, I would give him
a cochlear implant.

So, the truth is, you
don't accept your son

for who he is, do you?

Of course I do.

Then why are you planning to
have him surgically altered?

Objection.
Inflammatory.

Sustained.

Why the rush, Mr. Miller?

Why not allow Adam

the freedom of experiencing
life as a deaf person?

Then, as an adult, he
can decide for himself.

The best time is now.

For him or for you?

A parent has to decide
what's best for his child.

But the child's mother is
pleading with you not to do it.

Is she not also
the child's parent?

She may be deaf,
but she has a voice.

Does she not, Mr. Miller?

I'm thinking
of Adam's best interests.

But is it
in Adam's best interest

to surgically insert
an electronic device

into his skull,
when the benefits

are controversial and the
long-term effects are unknown?

I want my son to be able to hear
a smoke detector or a symphony,

use a telephone, or hear
someone yell, "Look out!"

Or his grandmother say,
"I love you."

I mean, is that
such a terrible thing?

-Mr. Miller, nobody is saying...
-What am I supposed to do?

Keep him from hearing on purpose
when I don't have to?

Why would I do that?
What kind of father would I be?

Your Honor, could you
please have

-Mr. Miller answer the question?
-I would cut off my right arm

in a heartbeat for my boy,
if that made his life easier.

Isn't that how a parent
is supposed to feel?

Is Dan a bad father?

No.

And do you consider
yourself a good mother?

Of course.

And yet Dan is trying to afford

every opportunity for your son
and you are not.

Objection.

I'll rephrase.

How do you reconcile the fact
that your son,

without an implant, has a
much more limited future?

That's a matter of opinion.

-I don't think he does.
-Opinion, Mrs. Miller?

We've established that
statistically.

I'm a teacher.

I teach my students that
deafness is not a disability.

GRISHAM:
All right.

That it's something
to be celebrated.

All right, all right,
thank you, Mrs. Miller.

Wait. I've not stopped talking.

You've answered the
question, Mrs....

Your Honor, objection!

The wtness should be allowed to
answer the question fully.

I will allow it.
The witness will continue.

I teach them to accept
their deafness,

cherish it, revel in it.

As his mother, I tell Adam
to accept his deafness.

That he is not disabled.

-That he is able... -Your Honor,
we've already established

that Adam <i>is</i> disabled.

You've made your point,
Mr. Grisham.

He is able to do
everything except hear.

That his inability to hear

has no effect on
his ability to think

to achieve, to love.

Adam's ability to love is not
in question here, Your Honor.

Let me hear her out,
Mr. Grisham.

LAURA: My job is to teach
Adam to be himself,

to thrive and grow up to
become a decent and kind man

no matter what.

To celebrate his difference,
his uniqueness.

Adam has already experienced
one trauma-- becoming deaf.

I feel he shouldn't be
put through another one.

I believe
what's best for Adam

is to let him be.

Let him be Adam.

And that's why

I must have custody of my son.

Let me remind both parties
once again:

This is a custody hearing.

The purpose of these
proceedings is not

for the court to decide

whether the minor
should receive an implant.

That's a personal issue.

I will deliberate
over the weekend.

This court will reconvene
on Monday at 3:00,

at which time

I will rule on the matter
of the custody of the minor.

[gavel bangs]

It's all right.

Leonard, what does this mean?

Exactly what she said.

We have to wait till Monday.

Longest weekend of my life.

You still have the
rest of the day.

Go to work, Dan.

Do you think I have a chance?

You have a good chance.

GRISHAM:
Have a nice weekend.

-See you Monday.
-Yeah.

See you Monday, Ms. Tate.

TATE:
Yeah, see you then.

WOMAN: And I was thinking,
I've been very happy

at Hunter Connor & Associates,

so how do I know we
won't regret a move?

Dan?

What?

Oh, no. I heard you.

Did you?

Really?

Uh, no, I did. I did.

Uh, to me, public relations
is about perception.

My job is to recognize
what it is about you

that makes you, you know,
uh... unique.

Special.

Ah.

Look. I've got a moustache.

Yes, I can see that.

See, I can shave,
just like Daddy.

When is Daddy coming home?

Drink up. Time for bed.

I don't like Daddy
not being here with us.

Neither do I.


[doorbell rings]

I, uh... I...
[clears throat]

I-I didn't know...

My hands are shaking.

[groans, clears throat]

My, uh...

My father used
to tell me that, uh,

life was shaped by choices.

Everybody must decide

what's best for them.

Make their own choice.

And, uh...

from the beginning, I said

I only wanted what
was best for Adam.

That's not true.

I really wanted...
what was best...

for me.

And...

what's best for me...

...is you.

I miss...

my best friend.

I've been <i>so</i> afraid

of losing my connection
with my boy

and through all of this,

all I wanted was to run
to my best friend and talk,

to share how

scared I am.

How hurt I felt.

How confused I've been.

How much I've been struggling.

And the hardest part was...

not... being able to.

I want my best friend back.

Adam...

wants...

he needs...

both of us.

I don't think we need a judge

to, um... decide--
no, no-- to choose...

...what's best for us.

Whatever choices we make...

...we make together.

As a family.
