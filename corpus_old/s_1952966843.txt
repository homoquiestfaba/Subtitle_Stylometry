NARRATOR: <i>'Twas three</i>
<i>nights before Christmas</i>
<i>at the magical North Pole,</i>

<i>and all the new elves</i>
<i>had gathered round Santa</i>
<i>to be given their roles.</i>

<i>''Toy-making elf!''</i>
<i>Santa decreed</i>
<i>to the first one in line,</i>

<i>and to the next,</i>
<i>and the next,</i>
<i>and the next 209.</i>

<i>But when Santa came</i>
<i>to the last elf</i>
<i>standing there,</i>

<i>something very different</i>
<i>he was to declare!</i>

<i>''Stable elf!''</i>
<i>he proclaimed,</i>
<i>expecting a cheer.</i>

<i>''You'll be the one in charge</i>
<i>of all things reindeer.</i>

<i>''You'll talk to them</i>
<i>and make them all fly.</i>

<i>''The sole keeper</i>
<i>of the magic berries</i>

<i>''that carry them</i>
<i>into the sky. ''</i>

<i>But a cheer</i>
<i>he did not receive.</i>

<i>Nor a smile,</i>
<i>nor a chuckle.</i>

<i>Instead, poor Henry's</i>
<i>knees started to buckle.</i>

<i>''I don't like reindeer, ''</i>
<i>he protested,</i>
<i>''Or any animal, I mean,</i>

<i>''they slobber and shed</i>
<i>and are so very unclean. ''</i>

<i>But Santa's mind</i>
<i>was made up,</i>
<i>that much was clear.</i>

<i>So that night,</i>
<i>Henry came up</i>
<i>with a plan,</i>

<i>to change his career.</i>

<i>He would make</i>
<i>a toy of his own</i>
<i>as a secret surprise.</i>

<i>One that will force</i>
<i>the big man to see</i>
<i>him with new eyes!</i>

<i>But Henry's toy-making skills</i>
<i>were a long way from strong</i>

<i>and before he knew it,</i>
<i>things went wronger</i>
<i>than wrong!</i>

<i>Now, reindeer</i>
<i>are well-trained.</i>

<i>They can sit,</i>
<i>stay and heel.</i>

<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>they'll pass up a free meal.</i>

<i>Henry tried to stop</i>
<i>them from floating away,</i>

<i>but only succeeded in</i>
<i>falling into the sleigh.</i>

<i>It was a disaster,</i>
<i>a catastrophe,</i>
<i>a tangled mess</i>

<i>that might never</i>
<i>have been unwoven,</i>

<i>that is, were it not</i>
<i>for a big, sloppy dog</i>
<i>named Beethoven.</i>

MASON: Hot chocolate,
get your hot chocolate!

lt<i>'</i>s low in fat
and 100% organic.

At least... Not really.

(HORN HONKlNG)


CHRlSTlNE: Mason!

Hey, Mom.

Hot chocolate?
Goes to a good cause,

teenagers whose mom<i>'</i>s
won<i>'</i>t buy them what
they want for Christmas.

Yeah, l think
l<i>'</i>m going to stick
with my own cause,

moms who think
there are more
productive uses

of teenager<i>'</i>s time
than video games.

How<i>'</i>s it going anyway?

Like Grandpa,
after the divorce.

A big opportunity
just came up at work,

and l<i>'</i>m gonna need
your help with this.


Oh!

Oh, Jesus!
Oh, no, no, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.


Get off me!
Come here, come here.

(COMMANDlNG BEETHOVEN)

Okay, okay.

Don<i>'</i>t worry,
l think that just
means he likes you.

Yeah? Well, the feeling
is definitely not mutual!

What<i>'</i>s this drool machine
doing here anyway?

You don<i>'</i>t recognize him?
This is Beethoven.

He stayed in town to
star in my commercial.

l need you to watch
him while l get
everything else ready.

Watch him?
But, Mom, l don<i>'</i>t
even like dogs

and it<i>'</i>s Christmas break,
l got my own stuff to do.

Can we talk about this later?
l really have a lot
l<i>'</i>ve got to get done.

Yeah, whatever.

Okay!

Here is his bed.

lt<i>'</i>s in his contract,
he has to have it handy
anytime he needs it.

Mom, really,
l<i>'</i>m working here,

let it be handy at home.

Okay, sweetie.

Rapidly maturing
son of mine.

Oh, sorry!

Don<i>'</i>t look so glum!

How many other kids
your age get to hang out
with a celebrity dog?

Celebrity dog?

Yeah, well, that<i>'</i>s
really gonna help me
sell hot chocolate.

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

(CAR STARTlNG)

Come, get your
picture taken

with the world-famous
celebrity dog, Beethoven!

lt makes a great
Christmas gift.

ls that really
Beethoven?

Wow. He looks so much
more slobbery in person.

Hi! (LAUGHlNG)

Here you go.

l have to give
that to my nephew,
he just loves Beethoven!

Thank you.

Next, please!


Guess you can do a lot
more than just drool,
can<i>'</i>t you?

(HENRY SCREAMlNG)


Beethoven, quiet down.
You don<i>'</i>t want to scare
off the customers.

Wait!

Beethoven, stop!
What<i>'</i>s gotten into you?

(ALL EXCLAlMlNG)

Don<i>'</i>t worry,
we<i>'</i>ll be back.
Beethoven!


l<i>'</i>m sorry.
God!

Ho, ho. Merry Christmas!
There you go.

Thank you.

Merry Christmas.


Ho, ho, ho... Uh-oh.

Wait, wait, wait, wait!

Was that Beethoven?
(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

Ow!

Stupid mutt!

Hey, l think
that<i>'</i>s Beethoven!

Who?

Beethoven,
the world-famous dog.

Come on, let<i>'</i>s get
this stuff inside.

There<i>'</i>s only two
more shopping days
until Christmas

and l want to squeeze
every last penny out
of this place.


Go, come on.

All right,
l<i>'</i>m going.

(HENRY SCREAMlNG)

Stop it!
Stop doing that! Stop!
No, no. No, don<i>'</i>t!


No!

Oh!


Hey, get back here!

Don<i>'</i>t tell Santa, okay?


(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

What in the...
Hey, hey!

Listen, dog,
can you, uh,
go get help?

Can you go get
your owner, or anybody?
Just do it quickly, okay?

Beethoven!


Wow. That actually worked!

Beethoven, what<i>'</i>s gotten into

you?
(HENRY CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Hey, um, do you think
you could, uh, help me
out of this tree?

lt<i>'</i>s kind of an...


...emergency!

Um. What if l do something
to break your fall?
What!

Break my fall?
Maybe we can
find a solution

that doesn<i>'</i>t
involve the words
<i>''</i>break<i>''</i> and <i>''</i>fall!<i>''</i>




(HENRY GROANlNG)


Um... Uh...

Uh, Mason.
Mason, okay.

Can l ask,

why are you dressed
like a Christmas elf

and what were you
doing in that tree?

Well, l<i>'</i>m dressed
like a Christmas
elf because

l<i>'</i>m a Christmas elf!

And, um, as for the tree,

let<i>'</i>s just say it had
something to do with
reindeer, Santa<i>'</i>s sleigh,

and the fact that l<i>'</i>m
probably never allowed
in the North Pole again.

Okay, well, um, it was
really nice to meet you

and, uh, we really have
to get going, okay?

So, uh, come on, Beethoven.

Let<i>'</i>s go. Let<i>'</i>s go.
Great job, Beethoven.

Got me rescuing
an insane guy
dressed like an elf.

(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

Look, wait!


Wait!

ANNOUNCER: <i>This Christmas,</i>
<i>Beethoven wants you</i>
<i>all to consider</i>

<i>giving the gift you</i>
<i>can't find in a store.</i>

<i>Rescue a pet from a shelter</i>
<i>and give someone a home</i>
<i>for the holidays.</i>

<i>And please become</i>
<i>a monthly donor</i>
<i>to the ASPCA.</i>

(ANNOUNCER READlNG)

Well, what do you think?

l think l like it.

Really?
Really!

Christine, l think you
hit this one right out
of the dog park.

Thank you for
this opportunity.
Hold on a second!

What if l was
to tell you,

that l have another
possible promotional
opportunity for Beethoven.

What are you
talking about?

Well, l spoke with
the mayor this morning.

He told me that the town
Christmas parade this year
is going to be televised.

Anyway, he wants Beethoven
to be the Grand Marshal
of the parade.

lsn<i>'</i>t that fantastic?

This could be an enormous
opportunity, for the firm
and for you.

But Beethoven<i>'</i>s
expected home.

Don<i>'</i>t you worry
about that.

l<i>'</i>ve already
made arrangements
with his owners

for all those details.

Cooper, if you do
a good job on this,

l think we can
pretty much guarantee
that promotion is yours.

What do you say?
You up for it?

Absolutely, Mr. Rexford.
Thank you.

Wait. Wait. Look.

Look. Hey, l need your
help all right? Okay?

Um. Look, l don<i>'</i>t know
anyone else here

and l really don<i>'</i>t
know where <i>''</i>here<i>''</i> is!

And Santa<i>'</i>s gonna be
really upset if l don<i>'</i>t...

Okay, look. l<i>'</i>m not
a six-year-old kid anymore.

l know that there<i>'</i>s
no such thing
as Santa Claus.


Yes, there is!

And l have to get
his magic toy bag
back before Christmas.

l think what you
need to find is
a good psychiatrist.

Maybe a whole
team of them.

What? No! No, no, no,
l<i>'</i>m telling the truth!


Ha! See, your
dog believes me.

He must<i>'</i>ve saw me
fall out of the sleigh,
didn<i>'</i>t you, boy?

Where did they
get him?

What if l can prove
that l can understand

what this drool
machine is saying?

How are you gonna do that?

By talking to him.

All right.

Let<i>'</i>s see what
we have here. Okay.

<i>''</i>Reindeer, Snow Bunny,
Polar Bear, Weasel,

<i>''</i>Bank Executive?
Oh, dog!<i>''</i> Here we go!

Talk about dog breath.

All right,
so, Beethoven,

tell me something
about Mason that
only you would know.

Okay, l<i>'</i>ll play along,
but you<i>'</i>re crazier
than a calico on catnip

if you really think you<i>'</i>re
gonna be able to understand
what l<i>'</i>m saying!

l can understand you
perfectly, Beethoven.

You<i>'</i>re kidding me, right?

Wait, wait, wait.

Am l on that Animal
Planet show where they
play pranks on stupid...

No, no! You<i>'</i>re not on
any show, Beethoven.
All right?

Just tell me something
about Mason, will you?

Okay, okay. l<i>'</i>ve only
been talking to people
for about 30 seconds,

so sorry if l<i>'</i>m
a little distracted!

By the way, you wouldn<i>'</i>t
happen to have any

sugar cookies
on you, would you?

Beethoven!

Sorry, sorry.
Okay, something
about Mason.

Hmm.

l don<i>'</i>t know too
much about him,
but here goes.


That<i>'</i>s a little exploitive.

Okay. What did he say?

were selling his picture
without his permission

and<i>l</i>or giving him a cut!
(BEETHOVEN GROWLlNG)

Yeah, he usually gets 25%
of all ancillary income.

Paid in bones, of course.

So, you<i>'</i>re telling me

there really is
a Santa Claus?

Uh, duh.

Not just some dopes
who act out a fantasy
for little kids every year?

That<i>'</i>s right.

And you<i>'</i>re a bonafide
Christmas elf?

Not just some whacko
who just got out
of the nuthouse.

Tell you what,
just call me Henry.

This is surreal.

His jacket
totally clashes
with his knickers.

Totally!

Come on, you got
to let me try it.
No!

No, l am sorry, man.
That<i>'</i>s one thing
Santa is very clear on.

Christmas magic is
not to be used outside
any non-North Pole employee.

Something to do with,
like, liability

or insurance,
something like that.

Look, forget that.
We have bigger problems,
all right?

lf l don<i>'</i>t find Santa<i>'</i>s
toy bag before 1 2:00
on Christmas Eve,

then he won<i>'</i>t have enough
time to deliver the presents
on Christmas morning!

And then l<i>'</i>ll get
stripped of my bells.

Trust me, that<i>'</i>s
a really bad thing
up on the North Pole.

Christmas Eve, right?

That gives us
just over 48 hours.
(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

That should be
plenty of time.

l hope so.

l would hate to see
what would happen

if that bag ended up
in the wrong hands!

Honey, they have
Red Rover.

l can<i>'</i>t believe it.
All the other stores
are sold out!

Wait a second.
ls this right?
$99.99?

Why, yes! l just
priced it myself.

We thought it was
supposed to be more

in the price-range
of 20 bucks.

Pro-model, 25 extra sounds.
Sings with his very
own online app-store.

lt<i>'</i>s the only thing
Charlie asked for
this year.


Pro-model,
highway robbery!

Keep the penny.

Suckers!


They couldn<i>'</i>t
find it anywhere else

because we stole it
from everywhere else!
Right, boss?

Ow!
Shut up!

This is our best scheme yet
and l<i>'</i>m not going to let
your loose lips sink it.

And what the heck
are you wearing?

lt<i>'</i>s an elf costume.
Like they wear
at the North Pole.

l know it<i>'</i>s
an elf costume,
half-wit.

What l want to know
is why are you
wearing it?

l thought it would
help with business.

You know that
cell phone store
down the street?

They<i>'</i>ve got a guy
out front dressed
as a cell phone.

Only it<i>'</i>s Christmas
and we don<i>'</i>t sell
cell phones.

So l figured...

Ow! Ah!

Shut up. First of all,
you<i>'</i>re an idiot.

Second of all,
you<i>'</i>re an idiot.

Third of all, look around.
Business is doing just fine.

ln fact, this might
be my best scam since
<i>''</i>Most Wanted Mopeds<i>.''</i>

Ooh! Or even <i>''</i>Most Wanted
Kitchen Appliances<i>.''</i>

ln fact, l think
it might be time

for another one
of our midnight
shopping sprees.

(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

Okay, you hit Toy
Bonanza on Route 30.

They should be
restocked by now.

And l<i>'</i>ll check
out Oy What A Toy
on Nazareth Boulevard.

And take that
stupid costume off!

You look ridiculous.

The woman at
the Halloween store...

Who charged you $40.

...said l looked
fashionably festive.

Mmm.

No. A cheap
knock-off, at best.

Hey!

Sorry, everyone,
we<i>'</i>re closing
a bit early today.

Please take your purchases
to the check-out counter now.

That<i>'</i>s right, move along.

(CHRlSTMAS JlNGLE PLAYlNG)

<i>Elves wear tights</i>
<i>and elves wear tunics</i>

<i>Elves are Santa's</i>
<i>little eunuchs</i>

Freaks of nature.

(TlRES SCREECHlNG)

What the...

lnconsiderates!

Leaving their junk
right in the middle
of the street.


That<i>'</i>s twice in one day
with the same foot!

What the heck
is in here anyway?

Toys.

What?

What the...


Groovy.


l<i>'</i>ll be ho, ho, hoed!

(DlALlNG ON CELL PHONE)

KENNY: <i>Most Wanted Toys,</i>
<i>may I help you?</i>

Yeah.

Cancel the toy ride!

<i>Okay.</i>

l think l just found
a whole new source
of inventory.

<i>Whatever you say, boss.</i>

(DOG BARKlNG)

What are you looking at?

Finders, keepers!



(TlRES SQUEALlNG)

(WHlMPERS AGAlN)

HENRY: Mmm.

So this is
called pizza?


lt<i>'</i>s delicious!
l mean, it could use
a little bit more nutmeg,

but, hey, everything
could use a little
bit more nutmeg.


So, what do you guys
eat at the North Pole?

Well, mostly
milk and cookies

<i>'</i>cause, you know, Santa
draws up the menu and...

Um, how about the lnternet?
Do you guys have that?

We have the Winternet.
Freezes up a lot, though.

Uh, do you guys
go to school?

We are supposed to,

but every day
is a snow day.

Holy...

You know, l have
to admit l thought
you would be shorter.

Yeah, it<i>'</i>s a common
misconception,

but l<i>'</i>m pretty average
as far as elf-sizes go.

l am member of
the National Association

for the Advancement
of Larger Elves.

What else do we have wrong?
Do elves really make toys?

Uh...

Well, yeah,
all of us do like...

We wouldn<i>'</i>t be
elves if we didn<i>'</i>t
make toys, right?

What about the whole
talking-to-animals thing?
Do all elves do that?

Well, yeah.

Each and every
one of us do.

Definitely not just
the stable elves.
Stable elves.

What are stable elves?

Oh. Nothing special.

l mean, uh,
nothing important.

Hello, Mason, Beethoven,
and Christmas elf.

Mason, is this
a friend of yours?

Uh, no, you actually had
it right the first time.

This is Henry and, well,
he is a real-life
Christmas elf.

(HENRY CLEARS THROAT)

Greetings from
the North Pole,
my lady.

Your son was kind
enough to help me look
for Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag.

Yeah, it fell off
the sleigh while we were
passing over your town.

Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag?

l know what you
are thinking, Mom,
but it<i>'</i>s true.

l mean, Beethoven
must<i>'</i>ve seen him
fly across the sky.

And, well, let<i>'</i>s
just say that

nobody is going
to get any presents
if we don<i>'</i>t help him.

Ah!

Okay, l see
what<i>'</i>s going on.

Look, l appreciate
you playing along
with my son<i>'</i>s little game,

but l am very busy
tonight and l just

don<i>'</i>t have the energy
to play along.

No, Mom,
it<i>'</i>s not a game.

Look, Mason.

l know you are still upset
that l<i>'</i>m not going to buy you

the MegaStation,
but really,

getting somebody from
the Christmas setup

at the mall to play
a prank on me?

What? Mom,
this isn<i>'</i>t a prank.

He really needs our help.

Look, l hate to be rude,

but hope you can
find your own way
back to the North Pole.

Oh.

Oh, yes. Uh...

(LAUGHlNG NERVOUSLY)


(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

Well, merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

(HENRY GlGGLES)

Really, Mason?
Christmas elf?

Hey. l<i>'</i>m sorry about that.
l don<i>'</i>t know why
l thought she<i>'</i>d help.

You must be
freezing out here.

Are you kidding me?

Man, compared
to the North Pole,

this feels like
the Caribbean!

Well, l think l got
some place you can stay
until we find your bag.

Sweet.

So this is the best l could
do on such short notice.

l know it<i>'</i>s not
like the Four Seasons.

There<i>'</i>s four seasons?

Huh!

Hey, are those
Christmas
decorations?

Uh, yeah.

My mom didn<i>'</i>t really
have time to decorate
the house this year.

Hmm.

l am highly
offended by this.


ls this a toy workbench?
What?

Not exactly.

That<i>'</i>s my dad<i>'</i>s,
but we did build
a toy or two on it.

Hey! ls this him?

Maybe he can
help us look.

Um...

My dad died last year.

l<i>'</i>m so sorry.

lt<i>'</i>s okay. Anyway...

Here you go.


First thing tomorrow morning,
we<i>'</i>ll start looking
for Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag.

<i>''</i>Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag<i>.''</i>

l can<i>'</i>t believe those words
just came out of my mouth.

(DOOR CLOSES)

Sure hope being
a toy-making elf
is worth all this.


Hmm? What<i>'</i>s going on?

What<i>'</i>s this?

Your special dog bed?


Okay.

What did you bring
it in here for?

You look like
you could use
it more than me.

Besides no one likes
an ungrateful elf.

Okay, okay, l<i>'</i>ll
try it out. Geez.

Attitude.

Oh...

(EXCLAlMlNG WlTH JOY)

Lay down with dogs,
wake up with angels.

This is actually more
comfortable than my
bed at the North Pole.

Thank you, Beethoven.

No problem, kid.

Well, all right. Okay.

Want some cover?
All right, here we go.



Oh, come on, man.

lt<i>'</i>s endless.

(LAUGHlNG EVlLLY)


Endless!

This Santa guy
has got a real
good racket going on.

Wow.

Where did you get
all this great stuff?

l told you,
from Santa<i>'</i>s
magic toy bag.

lsn<i>'</i>t that the new
place on Sycamore?

No. Santa<i>'</i>s
magic toy bag.

His actual magic toy bag.

You know, it would
really be nice

if you could give
me a straight answer
once in a while.

lt<i>'</i>s really insulting.

l am supposedly
your partner.

lf you want me to do
your laundry for you,
why don<i>'</i>t you just ask?

Would you like
that folded,
or on hangers?

Would you please
give me that?

And why don<i>'</i>t you get
started pricing stuff?

And didn<i>'</i>t l tell
you to take that
stupid costume off?

Yeah, but l enjoy
being an elf.

Plus it<i>'</i>s kind of slimming,
don<i>'</i>t you think?

No.

Wait a minute.

That costume
might come in handy
tomorrow after all.

Tomorrow?
What are we
doing tomorrow?

Advertising, Kenny.

A little good
old-fashioned
advertising.

(LAUGHS EVlLLY)

(BOTH CHUCKLlNG)

Miss Jingle, you didn<i>'</i>t
tell me we are under
a mistletoe. Come on.

Miss Jingle, have you been
snacking on some liver?


Morning, elf.

You know what?
You really got to stop
doing things like that, dog.

All right? l know
it<i>'</i>s time to wake up,

but you could<i>'</i>ve
just said something.

l<i>'</i>m a dog.
l still like
to lick.

Dog!

Do you mind?
Do you mind?


Ooh, tug-of-war.
l love this game.

Beethoven, we need
a plan, all right?

l mean,
how am l supposed
to find a toy bag

in a whole town?
lt could be anywhere.

l got a pretty good
sniffer you know.

You got anything
l might be able to
catch a scent from?


Try this.

Got it. Let<i>'</i>s roll.

Wait a minute.

Are you one of those FBl,
like, sniffer dogs?

Come on. What are
you waiting for?

(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

(HENRY SCREAMlNG)

Wait! Wait up!

Come on, elf.
Don<i>'</i>t they do cardio
in the North Pole?

Hey, Mason,
good morning.

Morning, Mom.

You<i>'</i>re up early.

Didn<i>'</i>t exactly
go to sleep.

Gotta get this model
to the builders
by tomorrow

if l want Beethoven<i>'</i>s float
ready for the parade.

Come here.
Tell me what
you think.

Okay.

Okay, so, Beethoven
is going to sit

in this oversized
director<i>'</i>s chair,

and then l have hired
carolers to stand
around him and sing.

Got the Hollywood sign
in the background.

And then we<i>'</i>re going
to have search lights

and flash bulbs go
off like paparazzi.

What do you think?
ls it glitzy enough for
a star like Beethoven?

Uh...

l guess.

Come on, kiddo,
l really want to know
what you think.

This is important.

lf l do well on it,
l get that promotion.

And then you<i>'</i>ll
be working even
longer hours.

Mason, l know
this hasn<i>'</i>t been
easy on you,

but this promotion
is really important
to our family.

Yeah, okay.

Uh, Mom, where
are you going?

Well, the glue
has to dry.

l<i>'</i>ll stick it in the garage
till tomorrow morning.

Stop. You...
You can<i>'</i>t go
in there.

What? Mason, come on.

your Christmas present.

What?
Uh, yeah, l put it
there last night

so l don<i>'</i>t want
you to see it.

l was in there last night.
l didn<i>'</i>t see anything.

That<i>'</i>s because
it got delivered
this morning.

No, not this morning.
lt got delivered
late last night.

Last night is when...

Mason, cut it out. Move.

Uh, Mom, l<i>'</i>m so... Okay.

Uh...

Mom, l think that
we should just, uh...

Uh, let<i>'</i>s, uh...

Let<i>'</i>s be in the garage. Uh...

Just us.

lt<i>'</i>s always hardest
around the holidays, huh?

Tell you what, why don<i>'</i>t
l see if l can get out of
work a little early tonight?

We can go have
a nice dinner together.
How<i>'</i>s that sound?

Yeah, it sounds great.

Now try to stay
out of here for
the next 24 hours.

That goes double
for Beethoven,

speaking of which,
where is he anyway?

Uh, he<i>'</i>s, um, in my room.

He actually slept
in my bed last night.

Really? Thought you
didn<i>'</i>t like dogs.

Yeah, but l think
he is kind of
growing on me.

Didn<i>'</i>t you have to
get to work, Mom?

Yeah. Yeah.

Got to pitch
my float idea
to Mr. Rexford.

Hey, keep an eye on
Beethoven for me, will you?

Of course.
l won<i>'</i>t let him
out of my sight.

Thanks, Mason.

l<i>'</i>ll just have
to find him first.

HENRY: Merry Christmas.

Jingle, jingle and
a ho to the ho, ho, ho.

You know,
Beethoven, you must
be really famous.

<i>'</i>Cause it seems
like every person

that lays eyes on you
is just left speechless.

Yeah, l<i>'</i>ve done
a few things.

Hey, hey, you still
have the scent?
Yep.

Okay, good.
Good, good, good.

You know, when l was
stuck in that tree,

l never expected
l<i>'</i>d be rescued
by a dog, you know?

Especially not one like you,
but actually l<i>'</i>m glad
that it happened.

Got it. Let<i>'</i>s go.


(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

Hey, Beethoven.


Oh! Hey, listen,
if you let me borrow
this, l will make sure

Santa brings you
one twice as good
for Christmas.

Please? Please?
Please? Please?
No. No. No. No.

l said please!
Thank you.

Merry Christmas.
Whoo! l<i>'</i>ll bring
it back later.

Help! The elves
have turned on us.

<i>Ho, ho, ho</i>
<i>Ho, ho, ho</i>

What the...

A Christmas elf.

A Christmas elf.

HENRY: Slow down.
Slow down.

Boss, where are you going?

Come here.


That is the greatest
elf costume.

Where did you get it?
Oh, thank you.

You know, Mrs. Claus
made it, so, uh...


BEETHOVEN: Hang on.


BEETHOVEN: Excuse me!


Everybody, limbo!

Beethoven!

Kenny, shut up and listen.
Meet me on the west
side of the pavilion.

The west side.
Look at a map!

Beethoven.
Beethoven, stop.

Slow it down.
Slow it down.

l<i>'</i>m scared. l<i>'</i>m scared.

Stop, slow down.
Slow it down. Beethoven.

(PEOPLE EXCLAlMlNG)

SMlRCH: Coming through.


Fresh kielbasa sausage.

Get it fresh here.
Try some.

Try some kielbasa sausage.

(PEOPLE EXCLAlMlNG)


MAN: You okay?

KENNY: Hey, boss. Hop in.

Drive, moron. Drive!

l don<i>'</i>t know what<i>'</i>s worse.

Looking for Beethoven.
Looking for a Christmas elf.



Hey, you stuck?

Here. Let me
help you with that.

There you go.

Got to be more
careful next time.


All right.
Go home. Go. Shoo!

Come on now, go.
What, don<i>'</i>t you
have a home?

You<i>'</i>re not
a stray,
are you?

Well, even if you are,
what do you want me
to do about it?

l already have one
dog that l don<i>'</i>t
want this week.


Go.

Whatever, pooch.

What?

What?

Oh, hey, boy.

Boy, it<i>'</i>s not your fault.

(DOG BARKS)
Hey, l<i>'</i>ve been looking
all over for you.

Hey, when did you
get another dog?

What? Oh.

No, l didn<i>'</i>t. lt<i>'</i>s just
a stray that won<i>'</i>t
stop following me.

A stray? Well,
what<i>'</i>s a stray?

What? Don<i>'</i>t you guys have
strays in the North Pole?

They are these dogs...

Actually, forget it.
Just tell me.

Did you guys find
the toy bag or not?

We tracked down
the guy who has the bag,

but it seems
he doesn<i>'</i>t really
want to give it up.

Does that mean you
actually saw his face?

<i>'</i>Cause then maybe we
can get a description.
This is a pretty small town.

Maybe l can recognize him.

l didn<i>'</i>t really
get a good look.

But maybe Beethoven did.

No, sorry, <i>amigo.</i>

No?

Now this is
just ridiculous.

l mean, someone had
to see a man pick
up a magic toy bag.


l saw him. l saw him.
He barked at me.

What was that?
l got a good look at him.

He was a mean-looking dude.

Wait, what<i>'</i>s he saying?

He<i>'</i>s saying
that he saw him.

(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

Attaboy!

Ready for me,
Mr. Rexford?

Ready as a rooster.
Come on in, Cooper.

New hobby?

No, new client.

This is the new
X-980 rocket.

You build it,
you paint it,
you launch it.

l like to familiarize myself
with all the products
that we promote.

How is our new
float coming along?

Oh, it<i>'</i>s great.

l<i>'</i>ve got some
really good ideas
l want to hit you with.

Good. You just float
<i>'</i>em right on by me.

Well, since Beethoven<i>'</i>s
a big movie star,

l was thinking put him
on a Hollywood-themed float.

You know,
with flavors of
Christmas naturally.

Christmas. Yes, yes, yes.

l see it in
my mind<i>'</i>s eye.

Peacocks and men in togas.

Or l was thinking,
flash bulbs and
sprigs of holly.

Oh, that<i>'</i>s even better.

That<i>'</i>s a great idea.

Total win-win.
Great.

Only one problem.

What<i>'</i>s that?

l want another win.
Excuse me?

That<i>'</i>s right, Cooper.
l wanna do something
that we<i>'</i>ve never done before.

l want a win-win-win.

Okay. How do we
get the third win?

We go nationwide with this.

We get every man,
woman and child
and chipmunk alive

to watch that
parade tomorrow.

You want chipmunks
to be watching?

Well, no, that<i>'</i>s
just an expression.

l really don<i>'</i>t
think it is.

What l want you to do
is press-release that float

like you have
never press-released
anything before.

You get it out to
all the major outlets
by tomorrow morning.

You<i>'</i>re gonna want to
word it just properly

so you<i>'</i>re gonna have
to put in a few extra
hours tonight.

You up for it?

Good, Cooper,
because that is how
you get a win-win-win.

(WOMAN EXCLAlMS)

Oops.

We<i>'</i>re not supposed
to be here again,

but l don<i>'</i>t want
to risk my mom

coming home before we
get the sketch done.

There should be
a drawing pad
in here somewhere.

BEETHOVEN: Okay.
Who<i>'</i>s hungry?

l am. l am.

Hey, wait.
So are you
telling me

there<i>'</i>s really animals
with no homes?

Yeah, a lot of them.

l don<i>'</i>t get it.
Why don<i>'</i>t people
just take them in?

l don<i>'</i>t know.

lt is pretty crummy
if you think about it.

Don<i>'</i>t you
have stray animals
at the North Pole?


ln fact,
as a stable elf,
it<i>'</i>s my job...

Stable elf?

Oops.

l thought you said you
were a toy-making elf.

What l meant to say
was stable elves,

it<i>'</i>s their job to make
sure that the animals
in the North Pole have homes,

but, you know,
l<i>'</i>m not one.

Nice recovery, elf.

Anyways, if this guy
didn<i>'</i>t have a home,

then where did he come from?

l don<i>'</i>t want to
talk about it.

l don<i>'</i>t know.
He probably escaped
from the pound or something.

What<i>'</i>s a pound?

lt<i>'</i>s where they put
animals who are lost
or have no homes.

l don<i>'</i>t think it<i>'</i>s
supposed to be such
a nice place either.

Trust me. lt isn<i>'</i>t.

Why? Don<i>'</i>t worry,
boy. You<i>'</i>re with
us now. Yeah.

Hey, don<i>'</i>t get
his hopes up.
l can<i>'</i>t adopt him.


What? But he chose you.

Chose me? (SCOFFS)

What do you
mean chose me?


You better do
some talking, bub.

Well, this
one stable elf
l know told me

that, uh, people
don<i>'</i>t really choose
their animals.

lt<i>'</i>s the other way around.

And it looks to me as
if you<i>'</i>ve been chosen.

Well, l don<i>'</i>t want to
be chosen, all right?

l don<i>'</i>t understand.

l just don<i>'</i>t want
a dog, okay?

l mean, it<i>'</i>ll probably
just end up getting sick,
or run off anyway.

Oh.

l understand.

Um, that would be hard.

(HORN HONKS)

Hey, my mom<i>'</i>s here.

Okay. l<i>'</i>m supposed
to go out to dinner
with her.

So that should give
you plenty of time
to get the sketch done.

Mason, l<i>'</i>m home!

Hey, Mom.

Honey.

Don<i>'</i>t tell me
you were outside
in the cold.

What? Uh, yeah, l was

going to shovel
the back walk.

What are you up to?
Up to?

l<i>'</i>m not up to anything.

Can<i>'</i>t a son just
shovel a sidewalk

for his mom
without being asked?

Not usually.

But l appreciate it.

And have l thanked
you yet for your help
with Beethoven?

Speaking of which,
how is our celebrity
guest anyway?

He<i>'</i>s great.
Been a real big
help actually.

A help?
Help with what?

Making this the most
memorable Christmas ever.

Anyway, um, ready to go?

Go. Go where?

Uh...

You said we were going
out for dinner tonight.

Oh, sweetie, sorry.
Something came up.

Let me guess, at work?
Yeah.

Mr. Rexford liked
my float idea so much

that he wants me to
do a press release.

Maximize coverage,
you know?

Yeah. l understand.
No problem.

Honey, when this
all blows over,

l<i>'</i>ll make it up
to you, l promise.

We<i>'</i>ll do something
fun for the Martin
Luther King weekend.

Swell. l<i>'</i>ll break out
the civil rights
decorations.

HENRY: Tell you what?
How about we just
get started?

His eyes. Can you
describe them to me?

Were they, uh, big
and round like...

Cookies.

Beethoven,
you didn<i>'</i>t even
see his face,

how do you know what
his eyes look like?

What? Oh, no, l was
just saying l<i>'</i>d
like some treats.

Bet the little
guy would, too.
Wouldn<i>'</i>t you, pal?

l guess l<i>'</i>m
a little hungry.

Listen, we don<i>'</i>t
have time for
treats right now.

Are you kidding?
There<i>'</i>s always
time for treats.

This is serious, okay?

So is this.
We<i>'</i>re hungry.
Yeah.

l<i>'</i>ve been running
around all day

and not once did
anyone offer me
so much as a biscuit.

l may be a Saint Bernard,
but that doesn<i>'</i>t
mean l<i>'</i>m a saint.

And who knows
when the last time
this little guy ate?

A week ago, Tuesday.

By the way,
that<i>'</i>s another part
about being a stray.

You skip a lot of meals.

He makes a very
good point, you know?

l think we just
about got him.

Hey, you know what
would really put
him over the edge?

What<i>'</i>s that?
Puppy-dog eyes.

Okay. Come on.

On three.
One, two, three...

(DOG WHlMPERlNG)

Okay. Okay.


Let me see what
l can do for you guys.

Okay. Let<i>'</i>s see.

Ah, here we go.

Look. Okay.
This is all
l got, okay?

All natural.
Good for elves and
good for animals, too.

One for you
and one for you.

Mmm.

Oh, boy. These are
the yummiest things
l<i>'</i>ve ever eaten.

(DOGS BURPlNG)

Guys.

You shouldn<i>'</i>t
have got me started.

You see, Henry,
it<i>'</i>s quite natural.

There are billions
of tiny bacterium

in our intestines
to help digestion.

Unfortunately, these
bacteria also release
gases such as methane

which prompt
the expulsion,
a.k.a. burps.

Put simply,
the excess gas
in our stomach

can<i>'</i>t all be taken
in and processed.

That<i>'</i>s what she said.

So, it must ultimately
be released through the mouth.


Among other places.


(FARTS SOFTLY)

(BOTH FARTlNG)

Very classy, Beethoven.

Yeah, well, l<i>'</i>m studying
to be a doctor when
the acting dries up.

Not me.
l<i>'</i>m gonna be a canine
gas-expulsion expert.

(FARTlNG CONTlNUES)

Can we please
just get started?

Sure thing, elf.


(FARTS AGAlN)
Geez.

All right.

Here we go. Ready?

Now, uh, can you
describe him to me?

Was his face
round like a snowman
or thin like Jack Frost?

STRAY: l don<i>'</i>t really
know who Jack Frost is,

but he definitely
didn<i>'</i>t look like
a snowman.

ls something burning?

(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

ls it getting
a little warm
in here?


BEETHOVEN:
Every dog for himself!

STRAY: Watch it.

My mom<i>'</i>s model!
Henry, what did you do?

We didn<i>'</i>t do anything.

Just get out of here.
l<i>'</i>ll handle it.

Mason! Mason,
is something on fire?

Uh...

Oops.

Really, Mom,
l didn<i>'</i>t mean
to do it.

Really, then what
were you doing
in the garage

when l specifically
told you not to
go in there?

And don<i>'</i>t bother telling me
that my Christmas present
was out there this time.

Okay. Look,
l was out there,

because that Christmas elf
that l brought home yesterday

was here with Beethoven.

Mason, this again?

Mom, it<i>'</i>s true.

lt<i>'</i>s not true.

Now l<i>'</i>m sorry
that l have to
work so much,

but punishing me
for that isn<i>'</i>t going to
make things any easier

on either one of us.
Do you understand?

l<i>'</i>m not punishing you.

You know what, Mason?
l don<i>'</i>t have time
for this conversation

because thanks to you,
l have a press
release to write

and an entire model
to rebuild before
tomorrow morning.

l<i>'</i>m sorry to do
this to you this week,
but you<i>'</i>re grounded.

Means you<i>'</i>re not going
to be leaving the house
until New Year<i>'</i>s.

What? l<i>'</i>m grounded?

l don<i>'</i>t know
what you thought
would happen,

you could<i>'</i>ve burned
the whole house down.

Well, Merry Christmas to me.

(HENRY LAUGHlNG NERVOUSLY)

Hey, sorry. Um...

Was that my fault?

Was that your fault?

Oh, boy.
Oh, here we go.

Let<i>'</i>s see.
Did you stupidly
and irresponsibly

lose the toy bag?
Yes.

Did you idiotically
land in that tree and
intrude on all our lives?

Yes.
Did you moronically set fire

to my mother<i>'</i>s float model?
Yes.

Yes, it was your fault.

l just don<i>'</i>t see it.

Oh!

What a dumb elf!

You know what?

Never mind.
Don<i>'</i>t worry
about it.

Just please tell
me that you got
a good sketch.

Oh, actually, we just
finished it. Yeah.

(HENRY LAUGHS)

Yeah, little guy
over there, he<i>'</i>s got
quite some memory.

Don<i>'</i>t you?
Yes, you do.

All right.
So, check it out.

Do you recognize him?

Actually, no.

What? This is great.

l make one mistake,
one mistake,
and all this happens.

<i>''</i>One little mistake<i>.''</i>
What does that mean?

Look, at this point,
l might as well just
tell you the truth.

l<i>'</i>m not really
a toy-making elf.

You<i>'</i>re not?

No.

l<i>'</i>m a stable elf.

And the whole reason
l<i>'</i>m here is because
l was trying not to be.

Doesn<i>'</i>t matter.

After this disaster,

l<i>'</i>ll be lucky
if Santa lets me
be an elf at all.

But wait,
l don<i>'</i>t get it.

Why don<i>'</i>t you
wanna be a stable elf?

All of my other elf buddies,
they<i>'</i>re all making toys.

And l<i>'</i>m just different.

What<i>'</i>s so bad about
being different?

Anyone can buy
a toy from a store,

but being the one elf
who can talk to animals,

and help with Santa<i>'</i>s
magic reindeer?

That seems
pretty cool
to me.

Hey, you can<i>'</i>t sleep there.

Okay, l got to admit.
You<i>'</i>re kind of cute.

And you look pretty comfy.

Don<i>'</i>t get used to it, okay?

l meant what
l said yesterday.
You can<i>'</i>t stay here.


HENRY: That<i>'</i>s right, Santa.

You won<i>'</i>t be able to
deliver any presents
because of me. Right?

There<i>'</i>s always
next year, right?

Who am l kidding?
lt<i>'</i>s Coal City for me.

Hey, don<i>'</i>t beat
yourself up, H-man.

You<i>'</i>re still
the coolest elf
l<i>'</i>ve ever met.

Of course,
you<i>'</i>re the only
elf l<i>'</i>ve ever met,

but you shouldn<i>'</i>t
let that affect
the compliment.

Well, thank you, Beethoven.

Hey. lf there were
more animals like you
at the North Pole,

l would be happy
to be a stable elf.

Oh, really? Come here.
Give me some sugar.

You still got to stop
doing that though.


You got to get used to it.
lt<i>'</i>s a real show of
affection in the dog world.

We dogs love to lick.

SMlRCH: <i>Ho, ho, ho</i>

KENNY: <i>Ho, ho, ho</i>

<i>Ho, ho, ho</i>


Quiet! You<i>'</i>ll wake up my mom.

<i>Visit me, Sylvester Smirch</i>

lt<i>'</i>s him.
lt<i>'</i>s him.

No, no, no, no,
he<i>'</i>s saying that

that<i>'</i>s the guy that
stole Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag.

<i>Where all the hottest toys...</i>

<i>Will be in stock.</i>

<i>That's right.</i>
<i>It's almost as if we</i>
<i>have an endless supply.</i>

Oh! Oh!

That<i>'</i>s Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag.
We found it. Yes.

Good work, guys.

Rub my belly.
Rub my belly.

Hey, calm down, elf.

Come on, big fella,
move those big bones.

l<i>'</i>m coming. l<i>'</i>m coming.
Hold on to your whiskers.

Okay. So my mom would kill
me if l left the house
while l was grounded.

So, you guys
are gonna take
this one yourself.

No problemo.

You know, l<i>'</i>m thinking
these two fur balls

can handle it
all by themselves.

You got that right, elf.

STRAY: On our way.

Operation Red Bag,
here we come.

SMlRCH ON PA:
<i>Merry Christmas, shoppers.</i>

<i>Sylvester Smirch here.</i>

<i>Welcome to Most Wanted Toys.</i>

<i>Don't forget to</i>
<i>stop by the Shop</i>
<i>Till You Drop Corner</i>

<i>for the hottest</i>
<i>and most wanted toys.</i>

These prices,
ridiculous.
Ridiculous!

But l<i>'</i>ve been to every
other store in town,
they<i>'</i>re all sold out.

This guy really
does seem to have
an endless supply.

Everyone, wait. Okay?
You guys cannot
buy these toys.

These toys are supposed
to be going to kids
all around the world.

What are you talking about?

What l<i>'</i>m talking about
is these toys are stolen.

(ALL GASP)

That<i>'</i>s right.
These toys do not belong
to the owner of this store.

Elf trouble.

You<i>'</i>re saying these
toys are stolen?

They are stolen

directly from
Santa himself.

That<i>'</i>s right, everyone.
The prices are so low,

it<i>'</i>s as if these
toys are stolen
from Santa himself.

viral marketing, folks!

That concludes
our 1 2:00 show.

Great show.

There will be
additional performances
throughout the day.

What are you
talking about,
Smirch?

Uh, folks,
please ignore Binky,
the drunken elf here.

He<i>'</i>s had a little
too much eggnog
this morning.

(EXCLAlMlNG lN PAlN)

Kenny, rip these
nice people off.

l mean, ring these
nice people up.
l<i>'</i>ll be right back.

Get out.

Hey, you listen
to me, all right?

l<i>'</i>m not leaving here
without Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag.

lf you<i>'</i>re not gone in
the next three minutes,
l<i>'</i>m gonna call the police.

And who do you think
they<i>'</i>re going to believe?

A taxpaying merchant
with a lease and a permit

or little Mr. Fancy Pants
and his mangy-mutt parade?

Hey!

Chop-chop. Let<i>'</i>s shop.


All right. We have
to get back in there.

l wonder if they sell
chewy toys in there.

HENRY: Hey. You see
that small window
in the back?

All right, here<i>'</i>s the plan.

l can create
a diversion
out here

and you guys
can sneak around
and grab the bag.

l think l can handle that.
HENRY: But...

How am l gonna do that?

Hey, elf.

Not now, Beethoven.

Can<i>'</i>t you hear that music?

Beethoven,
seriously,
all right?

This is no time
for music, okay?

We<i>'</i>re trying to
think of a plan here.

Music is the plan, silly.

What do you mean,
<i>''</i>Music is the plan<i>''</i>?

Come on, elf.
Get moving.

Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

(SlNGlNG <i>JINGLE BELLS)</i>

BEETHOVEN: Now, go.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

Whoa! Whoa!

All right,
they call you Beethoven
for a reason, huh?

BEETHOVEN: Come on.
Let<i>'</i>s go, little guy.

Right behind you.

(CONTlNUE SlNGlNG)

Hey, hey. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Hey, hey.

Um, l<i>'</i>m new in town
and l would love to be
a part of your group.

Dude, do you ever wear
your regular clothes?

Who are you anyway?

The name<i>'</i>s Presley.

Elfis Presley.

Anyways, um, would you
guys be interested in
taking a new member?

Uh, not really.

Oh, come on.
Please. Please. Please.

Easy, Presley,

don<i>'</i>t get your
bells in a bunch.

Just stay in tune.

Don<i>'</i>t frighten
anyone, <i>capisce?</i>

Yeah.

(SlNGlNG CONTlNUES)

Here you go,
three more.

Oh, boy. Christmas carolers.

Don<i>'</i>t even
think about it.

Just one song.
l mean, everybody loves
Christmas music, right?

Wrong. Besides,

it<i>'</i>s probably just
another trick by
that irritating elf.


Come on!
An entire crowd of
Christmas carolers?

l<i>'</i>ll make you a deal,
we get to listen to
one Christmas carol

and you don<i>'</i>t have
to buy me a Christmas
present this year.

l wasn<i>'</i>t going to
get you a Christmas
present anyway.

Oh, please, boss,
with candy canes
on top. Come on.

l just want to hear
the Christmas carolers!

Oh, all right.
lf it<i>'</i>ll shut you up.

lt will.

No, no, no, boss.

One song.

For the memories.

comfortable around garbage.

l am in hell.

l wonder if this is
considered barking
and entering.

BEETHOVEN:
Come on. Let me in.

What are you
waiting for?

l<i>'</i>m freezing
my jingle bells
off out here.

<i>December is all</i>
<i>work and no play</i>

<i>...hours of an</i>
<i>average working day</i>

<i>I'll try to make it</i>
<i>through Christmas day</i>

(HENRY LAUGHS)

Wait a second.
Those aren<i>'</i>t the lyrics.

Oh, what?

You don<i>'</i>t know that verse?
SMlRCH: Hey!

lt<i>'</i>s that insane elf.

Where?

Well, then, where is...

Santa<i>'</i>s bag!

Get back here with that.

HENRY: Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me!

Hold this.

Let go.

Give me that!

Give it to me,
you bloated flea bag!


Mommy!

Good boy, Beethoven.

l<i>'</i>ll take it from here.
(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

No!

l got it.
l actually
got it!


SMlRCH: Officer.

l<i>'</i>d like to report
a robbery

and a canine assault.

Listen, all right?
l am not the one who
stole the toy bag, okay?

lt was him.
lt was that guy
right there.

Uh-huh. Tell it
to the judge,
Christmas elf.

ln the mean time,
you have the right
to remain silent.

CAROLERS:
<i>Silent night</i>
<i>Holy night</i>

<i>All is calm</i>
<i>All is bright</i>

Cram it, carolers.

How rude!

(CAROLERS VOlCE DlSGUST)

All right,
get in the cruiser.

HENRY:
Wait, no! Stop it!


You take that stray
to the shelter.

Tata.

Mr. Smirch, l<i>'</i>ll meet you
back at the police station.
You stay there.

No.
Thank you, Officer.

No, you are a grumpy,
grouchy, evil person.

They made me do it.

(SlREN WAlLlNG)

Uh, just needs more
Christmas stuff.

You know, like,
do you think
we can get

some of those big
Christmas balls?

Christmas balls?
Yeah.

You know, those big,
colorful ornament balls?

Oh, and some sprigs
of holly, you know,
for Holly-wood?

Big Christmas balls
and sprigs of holly?

Sure, l<i>'</i>ll rustle
some up right now.

(SlREN WAlLlNG)

Wonder what<i>'</i>s going on.

l heard some nut

dressed like a Christmas
elf got arrested for
robbing a toy store.

REXFORD: Christine?

This is our float?

CHRlSTlNE:
Hi, Mr. Rexford. Yes.

Um, listen, l know
it<i>'</i>s a little different
from what we discussed,

but there were
some problems
with the model,

so we had to make
a few small changes.

Problem with the model?
What sort of problem?

Uh, it<i>'</i>s kind of
a long story.

Don<i>'</i>t you worry,
float<i>'</i>s gonna be great.

Needs balls.
Excuse me?

You know, those big,
colorful ornament balls.

You have some of those?

Of course,
Mr. Rexford.

And how about
some little wrapped
presents, too?

l mean, for heaven<i>'</i>s
sakes, that<i>'</i>s what
Christmas is about,

glitz and glamour
and presents.

Lots and lots
of presents.
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)

Trouble.

Hello.

lnga!

Swedish meatball.

l<i>'</i>m so glad
you got my tweet.

Beethoven.

(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

What happened?

Where is Henry
and the little guy?

Oh, man, l wish
l could understand you.

Hey, Mason.
Mom, l need to talk
to you about something.

What? What<i>'</i>s wrong?
lt<i>'</i>s the elf. l...

l think he may
be in trouble.
Let me guess.

Your little elf friend
knocked over a toy store

and now you want
me to post bail?

No, Mom, listen.
There<i>'</i>s really
something wrong.

We are not having
this conversation,
Mason,

because l need
to get Beethoven
ready for the parade.

Oh!

See, Mom? Even Beethoven
is trying to tell
you something.

Can<i>'</i>t you just put
your stupid job aside

for one second and
just listen to me?

l do listen to you, Mason.

No, you don<i>'</i>t.

Ever since Dad died
it<i>'</i>s like you barely pay
attention to me at all.

lt<i>'</i>s like you died, too.

And you know what?
lf Dad was here,

he<i>'</i>d listen to me.

l just know he would.


Have l really
been that absent?

What am l talking
to you for?
You can<i>'</i>t talk.

Beethoven!

Where you going?

Beethoven,
what are you doing?

(BEETHOVEN BARKS)
What have you got?

A candy cane?

l don<i>'</i>t want a candy cane
right now, Beethoven.

Okay.

Okay. Okay,
l<i>'</i>ll have
a candy cane.

l<i>'</i>ll have a candy cane.

Oh, that is horrible.

Oh, what kind of
candy cane is this?

The kind that turns this...


...into this,
<i>''</i>Hey, good-looking,
how you doing?<i>''</i>

What<i>'</i>s going on?

What<i>'</i>s going on is
it<i>'</i>s time for you

to get your nose
out of your butt

and listen to Mason.

He<i>'</i>s telling
the truth,
you know.

While you<i>'</i>ve been
out chasing your tail,

we<i>'</i>ve been trying
to save Christmas,
doggone it.

But you

can<i>'</i>t talk.

Oh, just get
over it already.

lt<i>'</i>s elf magic,
all right?

You know, from that real
Christmas elf who<i>'</i>s
living in your garage?

He<i>'</i>s got a whole bag
of tricks out there.

Berries that
make reindeer fly,

candy canes that
let us have this

cute little
conversation
we<i>'</i>re having.

(LAUGHlNG NERVOUSLY)

l<i>'</i>m...

l<i>'</i>m talking to Beethoven.

No, l<i>'</i>m the one
doing all the talking

and you<i>'</i>re just standing
there with the dopey
look on your face.

Now, are you gonna
help Mason save
Christmas, or what?

Hey.

lf we<i>'</i>re gonna get
that magic toy bag
back to Santa in time,

we better get going.

You believe me?

Mason,

l am so sorry
if l haven<i>'</i>t been
there for you.

After your dad died,
l was just so scared,
you know?

Scared of what?

Not being able to
be a mom and a dad.

l guess by trying to be both,
l stopped being either.

Well, l<i>'</i>m sorry, too.

Because l didn<i>'</i>t
think about how
hard it was for you.

l<i>'</i>ll try to remember
that next time

you need me to help
you out with something.

But hey,

it<i>'</i>s always hardest around
the holidays, right?

Yeah, that<i>'</i>s right.

All right.

Let<i>'</i>s get going.
What are we waiting for?

Beethoven told me that
your little elf friend
really is in jail.

Jail?

You<i>'</i>re not gonna
get away with this,
whoever you are.

And when Santa finds
out who you are,

oh, you are gonna be in
so much trouble, mister.

l am talking
<i>''</i>naughty list<i>''</i>
for life.

l want to press charges.

l want to throw
the book at him,
or Kindle.

Whatever<i>'</i>s available.
Hey!

Will you just give
me the bag back?

Look, where is your
Christmas spirit?

So, are we done here?

Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Smirch.

Merry Christmas.
What?

Oh. Uh...

Ditto.

Can you at least
give it back when
it runs out?

What did you say?

The bag, will you
consider giving
it back to me

after the toys run out?

Uh...

l<i>'</i>ll just humor
him, you know.

Perhaps he<i>'</i>ll slip
up and say something
we can use against him.

What<i>'</i>s this all
about, elfy?

When exactly will
the bag run out?

l don<i>'</i>t know.
But at the rate you<i>'</i>re
going, probably soon.

The elves only
made enough toys
for one year.

Only made enough?

Oh, that<i>'</i>s right.

You little creeps
actually made
all those toys.


Officer, l have
decided not to
press charges.

What? You have?
Yes.

After all
it is Christmas.

ln fact, l think
l<i>'</i>d like to offer

this strangely dressed
young fellow a ride home.

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

CHRlSTlNE: Excuse me.

We need to bail out an, um...

Elf.
Sorry, he<i>'</i>s already gone.

That guy who
owns the toy store

decided not to press
charges after all.

Even gave him
a ride home, too.

Mom, he<i>'</i>s got to
be up to something.

Let<i>'</i>s go.

Beethoven says, <i>''</i>Yes<i>.''</i>
l know.

l don<i>'</i>t get it, boss.
Why are we leaving again?

Because now that
we have the elf,

we have all we<i>'</i>ll ever
need to make money for
the rest of our lives.

No, no, no, no.

l don<i>'</i>t actually
know how to make toys.

l explained this to you.
This is just a costume.

l picked it up at
the Halloween store...

l<i>'</i>m not talking about you.

l am talking
about this elf.

This real Christmas elf.
(MUFFLED SCREAMlNG)

You<i>'</i>re saying that<i>'</i>s
a real Christmas elf?

No wonder his
costume is so good.

But wait.
We<i>'</i>re kidnapping him?

Yes. Don<i>'</i>t you see?

He is even better
than the bag.

That is going
to run out.

But he will be able to
make us all the inventory
we<i>'</i>ll ever need forever.

Kenny,

give a man a bowl
of rice and you
feed him for a day.

But give him an elf
who can make rice

and then we steal
the elf, we eat forever.

Look, l<i>'</i>m telling you,
l don<i>'</i>t know how
to make toys, okay?

The one time l tried,
it was a disaster.

Right. A Christmas elf
who does not know
how to make toys.

That<i>'</i>s a good one.

Maybe l am better at...

(MUFFLED SCREAMlNG)

But, boss, if that<i>'</i>s
a real Christmas elf,

then that must be
Santa<i>'</i>s actual
magic toy bag.

Boss, this isn<i>'</i>t right.
We shouldn<i>'</i>t be doing this.

Kenny,
haven<i>'</i>t l always
steered you right?

Eat a good breakfast, Kenny.
Wear your warm hat, Kenny.

Don<i>'</i>t eat
the yellow
snow, Kenny.

Hold it right
there, Smirch.
(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

l believe you have
some things that
don<i>'</i>t belong to you.

Yes, l do.

And l<i>'</i>m not
giving them back.

Cover me, Kenny.


(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

Now you see him.

No, no, no, no.

(LAUGHlNG EVlLLY)

Now you don<i>'</i>t.

Henry!

Mom, l got it!

Come on, Kenny.

(LAUGHS TRlUMPHANTLY)

(LAUGHS TRlUMPHANTLY)

Okay, come on,
we gotta get him.

(ENGlNE SPUTTERlNG)

l hate Christmas.

What are we gonna do?

Two words, run.

(BEETHOVEN BARKlNG)

Come on!

(UPBEAT CHRlSTMAS
MUSlC PLAYlNG)

Boss! Boss!

l don<i>'</i>t wanna
be a part of
this anymore.

Shut up.

Ha!

Oh, Santa, just what
l always wanted.

How did you...


No, l want
the red one.

All right.

Look, we<i>'</i>ve gone
too far this time.

l mean, stealing
old mattresses
is one thing,

but stealing
Christmas is another.

Kenny, you<i>'</i>re fired!

Oh, yeah? Fine!

l<i>'</i>m going back
to Boca Raton!

Only could you
forward my mail to
my mother<i>'</i>s house?

Move it, monkey.
Out of my way!
(BEEPlNG HORN)

Coming through!

Look out!

Get away, kid,
you bother me!

Move it or lose it!

Mommy!


(CROWD GASPS)

(SlREN WAlLlNG)

DlSPATCHER: <i>Suspect Smirch</i>
<i>wanted for toy theft</i>

<i>last spotted near</i>
<i>the Beethoven float.</i>

<i>Be alert, suspect is</i>
<i>stupid and dangerous.</i>

WOMAN: ls he all right?
MAN: Yeah.

You again?



(ALL EXCLAlM)

Ha! Okay,
that was awesome.

lt actually was.

There<i>'</i>s the bag.

(MUFFLED SCREAMlNG)

Anybody hurt?

Man, you know this
thing has a lot less
room than you think.

Now l recognize you.

You<i>'</i>re that thief who sold
me an overpriced mattress
three months ago.

Uh, sorry, not me.

Must have been
another, uh,
Christmas ball.


The guy is nuts.
Grab him.

POLlCEMAN: Ha!
We finally got
you, Smirch.

l gotta go.

This parade
is really starting
to rain on my parade.

Sorry, Mom.

l know this float
was really important
to your job.

And l<i>'</i>m sorry, too,
Mrs. Cooper. Um...

l really appreciate
all that you<i>'</i>ve
done for me.

Christine, there you are.
l heard there was an accident.

Oh, good heavens, no.

Not the big ball.

l<i>'</i>m so sorry,
Mr. Rexford.

But l<i>'</i>m afraid
it<i>'</i>s not gonna be...

MASON: Anything
you expected.

lt<i>'</i>s gonna be better.

Yeah it<i>'</i>s a...
My mom<i>'</i>s been
working on a new idea

and it<i>'</i>s gonna be cooler
and more appropriate
for Beethoven.

REXFORD: ls that so?

Well then, Christine,
what have you been up to?

You<i>'</i>re just gonna
have to wait and see
the parade. Yep.

lt<i>'</i>s gonna be great.

(MARCHlNG BAND PLAYlNG)

(CROWD CHEERlNG)

ANNOUNCER: <i>And now,</i>
<i>please give a warm welcome</i>
<i>to your Grand Marshal,</i>

<i>superstar dog, Beethoven.</i>

<i>In partnership</i>
<i>with the ASPCA,</i>

<i>Beethoven would</i>
<i>like to send you all</i>
<i>a message this Christmas.</i>

<i>Rescue a pet from</i>
<i>a shelter and give someone</i>
<i>a home for the holidays.</i>

<i>And please become</i>
<i>a monthly donor</i>
<i>to the ASPCA today.</i>

MASON: Beethoven!

Ah! Another partnership
between Beethoven
and the ASPCA.

Now that<i>'</i>s what
l call a <i>''</i>Win-win-win<i>.''</i>

Good work, Cooper.

l<i>'</i>ve said it once,
l<i>'</i>ve said it
a thousand times,

Christmas isn<i>'</i>t
all about glitz and
glamour and presents.

lt<i>'</i>s about goodwill,
and helping your
fellow man...


...and dog.
Thank you, Mr. Rexford.

But l can<i>'</i>t take
all the credit.

lt<i>'</i>s Mason<i>'</i>s idea
to include the animals
from the shelter.

Really? Apparently
the talent runs pretty
deep in your family.

Well, l think
it<i>'</i>s safe to say,
Christine,

that you have
got that promotion.

Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Rexford.

l can<i>'</i>t take it.

Unless it means that
l can spend more time
at home with my son.

Well, now that
you think of it,

that probably wouldn<i>'</i>t
be the worst thing for
our company either.

(REXFORD LAUGHS)

l tell you what,
you tell me what schedule
you want to work on,

and l promise you,
we<i>'</i>ll arrange it.

Thank you, Mr. Rexford.

Thank you.

Thank you so much
for your help on this.

Tell you what,

tomorrow why don<i>'</i>t we go
down and pick you up one
of those MegaStations?

Huh. (CHUCKLES)

Actually, Mom,

l<i>'</i>ve decided that there
are more constructive
uses of my time.

Like maybe taking
care of a dog.

What do you say?
Keep him?

Thought you didn<i>'</i>t
like dogs.

l didn<i>'</i>t think so either,
but he chose me.

Welcome to the family,
little guy.

Thanks, Mom.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, baby.

Hey, guys, do you think
that we can get me back
to the North Pole?

My bells are still
on the line here.

Oh!
Yeah. Um...

Yeah.


You think you can
make it back in this?

Yeah, l mean
it looks fine,
but one problem.

Who<i>'</i>s supposed
to fly it?
(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

BEETHOVEN: Come on, elf.

HENRY: The magic berries.

lf they can make
a reindeer fly,

then they can
make a dog fly.
(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

Well, so long, Mason.

l just want to
thank you so much

for helping me find
Santa<i>'</i>s toy bag.

Couldn<i>'</i>t have done
it without you, man.

And l wanna thank you
for something else, too.

What<i>'</i>s that?


For helping me see that
Santa was right about me.

You know,
l am a stable elf.

And different or not,

l wouldn<i>'</i>t wanna
be anything else.

No problem, Henry.

And l guess
l should thank you
for something, too.

Thanks for
making me realize

that believing
in Santa Claus

is definitely not
a little kid thing.

l am gonna need some
time for the tooth fairy
and Easter Bunny, though.

Yeah, all right.

Merry Christmas.

All right.
Merry Christmas.
(STRAY LAUGHS)

You ready, Beethoven?

Onward.

STRAY: Goodbye, big fella.

Goodbye!
Merry Christmas.

CHRlSTlNE:
Merry Christmas.


CHRlSTlNE:
Bye, Beethoven.

BEETHOVEN: Hold on.

Coming home,
here we go.

MASON: See you
later, Beethoven.

Merry Christmas, guys.

BEETHOVEN: Merry Christmas.

So what are you
gonna name him?

l think l<i>'</i>m gonna
name him after someone

who really helped us
out this Christmas.

Hey, what do you think
of the name Henry
or Hank for short?

BEETHOVEN: So long.

HENRY: (LAUGHlNG)
Merry Christmas!

NARRATOR: <i>In the end,</i>
<i>Santa made all</i>
<i>his deliveries,</i>

<i>and the holiday</i>
<i>hit no further snag.</i>

<i>Though it's important</i>
<i>to point out</i>

<i>that the best gifts</i>
<i>received that year</i>

<i>came not from his bag.</i>

<i>For little Hank,</i>
<i>it was a home,</i>

<i>and a happy one at that.</i>

<i>For Henry, it was</i>
<i>a calling he would</i>
<i>never give back.</i>

<i>For Christine and Mason,</i>
<i>it was something</i>
<i>enduring and true,</i>

<i>the gift of a healing</i>
<i>that was long overdue.</i>

<i>And as for our old</i>
<i>friend Beethoven,</i>

<i>it was the thanks of</i>
<i>one very grateful elf.</i>

<i>As well as</i>
<i>a special</i>
<i>ride home</i>

<i>from the big man himself.</i>

Merry Christmas,
one and all.

Humanity has been saved!

A helpless child<i>'</i>s
ski-board is now
back in his arms.

Oh, joy! Oh, rapture!
Merry Christmas!


l was wrong again!
People are crooks!

They took my
new ski-board!

Oh, the inhumanity
of it all!
