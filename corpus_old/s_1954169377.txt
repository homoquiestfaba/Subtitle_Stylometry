Kingdom of Samarza - Located in the Himalayas

A young soldier accompanies the King
during the last days of peace

Adam, ride next to me.

Your Majesty,
I'm just a soldier.

I could never ride next to you.

Adam , some day you'll make a 
fine soldier.

Some are born great.

Some achieve greatness.

And some have greatness trust
upon them.

October 10th , the United Nations

has rejected our need for help

Our situation becomes desperate
with every hour.

In a few days ,
The Skanji Empire

will unleash their entire fleet.

Today they send the taste 
of their wrath.

I am paralyzed of disbelief.

A part of me dies inside.

Their war is to eliminate our kind

and rule over our land.

We have no means of fighting back.

We are not violent people.

Nadia was born into culture

where women were treated like animals.

beaten and discarded.

She was thrown into world
of violence.

And the only way to survive

was to be stronger , smarter...

to kill.

He was ordered to assassinate our king.

and all the heirs to our throne

One by one , the heirs fell..

Until only the king remained...

...my poor king.

breathing his last breath , 

in my arms.

I know without the heir to
the throne

The Skanjis will forever rule us

But then he whispers

one hope,

One child, in a far away land.

Nadia sets out for this land

to kill this remaining heir.

I am Adam Arthavan

An ordinary soldier 
in king's army.

what makes ME special

Is the king spoke this final
words to me .

Adam, come closer.

listen carefully 

the great duty.

The last hope is upon you.

You are ours people only hope.

protect my last

remaining child.

The last princess.

NINJA'S CREED

National Cathedral, WASHlNGTON DC
To save the princess,

I must first start by finding the
royal maid.

Only she would know the location

of her Highness.

A royal maid to the Abassi Kingdom.

RIGHT LANE EXIT ONLY

Sorry , business or pleasure?

Pleasure.

Some girl I know is going to die.

Best friends , friends forever...

Katie,
second grade,

she is so hot.

dude she is so hot.
oh hell no.

Andrea.
hey look it's Jan.

Heads up.
she's gonna catch it.

Oh yes , did you see that?

You know the one with the 
Jean-Luc Picard?

The dude who is the captain.
You know what I'm talking about?

BUt Jean-Luc Picard is bald.

Haven't you ever thought:
Why is this guy bald?''

I mean they are like 1000 years
into future and the guy is bald.

I mean wouldn't they come up with
some kind of oil or soemthing

to cure baldness by then?

Why? You losing hair aligator?

What? I'm sorry what did you say?

Is it receiding on the side
or at the top?

...the game.
That's how we do it.

You know.
Alright man.

See ya.

Jim is coming over tonight.
you're like his next thing?

He broke up with Amy like
three weeks ago.

You still wanna go to the mall?
No.

I wanna buy this really cute blue 
halter top.

I really need to take a shower.
Shower later.

You said you wanna get 
your nails done.

No way.

What are you doing?

What are YOU doing?

There are people, they can see you.

Yeah well you won't let me
smoke in your room.

It's your move.

How's Jan?
Good.

Just good?

I can't help but think she is
missing out though you know?

I mean , she can't say things 
to me , her dad.

But she might say to her mom,
right?

Doug, you're great dad.

You don't wanna her the things
she says to her mom.

She's a teenage girl.

What do we have here?
Don't.

Come on,let's hear it.
Doug, it's the rules.

Come on, let's hear it.

You are the champion.

Thought that the real maid
was older.

Excuse me?

You've mistaken me for 
someone else.

The King always felt threatened 
by the evil Skanji Empire...

so I was afraid
constantly that ...

one day his family could
be eliminated.

Then, 17 years ago
secretly ...

gave his seventh child
for adoption ...

to ''American Guardian''.

The princess grew up as an
American

never knowing
her royal descent.

And only one person in our 
country

know the whereabouts of the 
princess ...

a Real maid

You.

The King always felt threatened 
by the evil Skanji Empire

I came to protect
the Princess.

You must feel so special

with what you know now.

Rest assured, the princess is safe.

Only the American guardian
knows where she is.

The American guardian is now 
her father.

Only he should be concerned 
with her safety.

No one else will ever find out

Who she really is.

That is an oath I gave to his 
Majesty,

An oath I will never break.

Especialmente no por
un soldado COMUN.

I thank you for your time.

We have a trouble.
We have a big problem.

How could this have happened?

Dad you rock.

Because I promised

she is gonna move upside.

Do me a favour.

Yes.

The American guardian.

One of the king's soldiers just
visited me in the chappel.

He could be working with 
the Skanji army.

We need to involve the police.

You must tell her who she is.

It's very important that Jan
doesn't know.

She get's worried for nothing.

You know. -I know , I also know
that you care so much for her

but circumstances have just changed.

I know but I don't want her life 
turn upisde down.

You put her to great risk.

Do you have any idea what Nadia
is capable of?

Do you have any idea

what Nadia did to the king's family

in Samarza?

I'm giving you one hour

to tell her who she really is,

and then I'm calling the police.

The only living heir

to the Abassi dinasty.

I'm not what you think I am.

Who are you?

Who are you?

Please. No.
Please calm down.

At your right leg you have
birthmark, resembling a heart.

Let me go.

Only the real princess has
that birthmark.

I have to go to the bathroom.

an assassin.

Her name is Nadia.

And she has never failed a mission.

But you managed to escape 
from her.

Do you know why?

Cuz you are not an opponent
to her.

You're a pray.

She doesn't want just, kill you.

She wants to enjoy it..

So if you want to go out there,

alone...

Go.

Or you can stay with me

if you want to live.

If you do not believe me,

call your american father.

Please leave a message
after the signal.

Dad, pick up the phone.

freak out, okey?

I was attacked at home.
All the windows are broken.

I just didn't know what to do.

I didn't know where you were.

I'm safe , okey?

Just come and get me.

I'm at 1.200th block of 
the Massachussets Av.

I am Adam Arthavan.

I was sent by his Majesty,
Niaz Abassi II,

To protect you.

If you want to evade such
injuries,

listen to me carefully.
You are from Samarza.

I'm at 1.200th block of 
the Massachussets Av...

I'm at 1.200th block of 
the Massachussets Av...

The assassin that tried to kill
you belongs to this tribe.

This has what to do with me?

5 days ago,

they attacked the palace

and killed your entite family.

Princess, our people have
lost all hope.

But if they knew an Abassi 
were alive...

it would give them the momentum

and the heart to fight back.

You have royal blood.

And that symbol is more powerful
than an entire army.

How did you know...

about my birthmark?

I found the king just
before he died.

In those moments ,
he told me everything

about you.

Look, I'm not a princess or,
whatever.

I'm just an ordinary girl.

Well, ordinary girl,

Some achieve greatness.

And some heave greatness
trusted uppon them.

just a king to me.

military generals.

Political analysts have
predicted

that if the Skanji Empire is able

to establish it's rule
in Samarza,

It will immediately strike at the
neighbouring countries.

of Myanmar, ButÃ¡n
and Nepal.

Thus far , the USA

is the country which has 
demanded Skanji Empire

withdraw from Samarza

and all other occupying 
territories.

You don't want to 
wake him up.

Aviation 3.

And that reason is gonna save 
our people.

How is she finding us?

We must go.
No.

be stronger.

Princess, we have to go now.

Please, I'm sorry but I can't.

OK.

No more running.

Are you disappointed in me?

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

At times, even I thought I 
could not go on.

I could not go on.

Looking at you now,

I see your courage.

I see Samarza's heart.

I see that I must end this.

Now.

For freedom.

My father was a blacksmith.

I tested every sword he ever made.

Leave and I will let you live.

Fight and you will surely die.

You betrayed the King.

You do not know what happened.

Look at what you've become.

You do not know what happened.

For what?

A single father was killed in his 
house late last night.

The police are still unclear

if this murder was related...

Those paintings are so cool 
uncle Rochy.

It's an exhibition.

You know, the art, the culture,

the entire whole experience...

Hey, boss.
Sorry to disturb you,

but that security guard is 
on the phone.

He sounds really depressed.

Rochester speaking.

Hey boss, I don't think I'm 
coming today.

Alright.
What happened?

I bruised my shoulder a 
little bit.

I went to the doctor and he 
said it's sleepwalking.

You hurt yourself before you know.

It was also sleepwalking right?

I should be fine.

In next coupple of days 
I'll come in.

Answer me something.

What do you work here , 
in my building?

It's monday.

You wake up in the morning,
you brush your teeth

take a quick cup of coffe,

Go to your job.

And I know you had many better
career options,

but you continue to stay here,
why?

I like being security guard.

Boss, I'm not the type of guy

who wants to save the world.

The bag number one there..
is 678.

678. Let me fix
this belt.

A single father was killed at
his house

late last night.

the police are still unclear if
this murder

was related to Massachussetts 
Av. building,

which occured only half a mile
from the murdered man house.

The victim is teenage daughter, is 
still missing

and the police  are not discarding the
possibility of kidnapping.

So majestic.

Extraordinary.

Come on ,darling.
Let's go.

Thank you.
Hey boss.

Oh you're back.

Hey Kathy. Did you see all these
wonderful paintings?

Yeah.
Did you have a good time?

Yeah ,you should see new Colieans.

Yeah, that are new copies from India,
beautiful.

Kathy, you know,
kings, queens,

princes and princesses ...

I wish we had them
in America.

I wish I was a princess.

There are no more princesses.

But you are as pretty as princess.

Listen, Adam, I wanted to tell you.

Do not take it personally
what I said

the other day by telephone,
OK?

I mean, I do that.

I say things I should not.

It is not my business to get into,
so please forgive me.

Boss, err, you believe 
too much in me.

But I know it's because you
care for me.

So I don't mind,

you know,
you get personal.

Thank you.

Bye.
Bye.

I told him I am not the
type of guy

that want's to save the world.

I lied.

My life is every man's 
biggest fear,

To be ordinary.

No, stop, stop.

Stop.

I know her.
I know her.

How could...?

The cathe... the cathedral.
The cathedral.

The cathedral.
I was there.

I was looking for someone.

Something about the painting.

I really believed that 
the kindgom was real.

The kingdom needed to
be saved.

Save this realm ...
Princess, Nadia ...

was real.

I imagined that I was 
the assassin.

Visited a royal maid.

I followed her.I remember I 
followed her to the park.

Wait, wait.

There was no maid.

But there was a man.

He was not my imagination.

He wasn't talking to anyone.

He was...
I followed the man

who led me to...

an ordinary girl.

How did you know
about my birthmark??

What did I do?

Why you look so sad?

It's like you lost 
something precious.

Adam.

Are you ready?

No.
are you ready,

Adam Arthavan?

I killed her.
I killed her.

... ready to become
a great warrior?

And a great murderer.
What could be more great?

Save the only hope
of our people.

My life

is the greatest fear
of every man.

To be...

Ordinary.
