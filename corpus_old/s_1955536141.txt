<i>Kal-El...</i>

<i>...my future grandson.</i>

<i>By the time you hear these words...</i>

<i>...your birth world will be a distant memory.</i>

<i>The house of El</i>

<i>led a revolution against tyranny.</i>

<i>The story of your family
isn't how we died...</i>

<i>...but how we lived.</i>

<i>I know you will fight
to save your world</i>

<i>just as I fought to save mine.</i>

Find the Fortress.

Your name is El,
never forget it.

The blood of House El
will always bind us together.
