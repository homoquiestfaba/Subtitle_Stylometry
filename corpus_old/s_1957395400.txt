[rapid footsteps]

[man panting]

â™ªâ™ª

Stay back!


[growling]
Please stay back.



â™ªâ™ª

[crickets chirping]


God, it's creepy down here.

Yeah,
let's get out of here.

Where's that window?

Um, I think it's gotta
be down here somewhere.

Wait a minute.

Did you hear something?
Yeah. Okay, let's move.

I told you
this shit is not right!

The other runaways?!

You know there are
no runaways!

We need to go now!

Okay, the back window's
usually open.

Oh!

You okay?
Yeah.

Be careful!

Wait a minute.

[heavy breathing]

All right, let's move.

Check to see if it's unlocked.

How did you know about this?

Mandi usually sneaks down here
during group to smoke.

[grunts]
Hurry.

[heavy breathing]


What are you doing?
Someone will hear us.

It's stuck.

[grunts]
Stop!

I think I have it.
Stop!

[heavy breathing]

What's up?

I told you.
I heard something.

Okay, listen to me.
The faster you hand me that bag,

the quicker we can get the hell
out of here and get help.

Suppose it's him.

Do you know what he would do?

Suppose he...

Hey! Hey! Karla.

Stop talking and climb up.

When we get outside
we will figure out the plan.

Why are you taking those?

Pure Silver.

Cash it in at the pawn shop.

Once I bought a five-dollar
silver tray at some garage sale.

Cashed in, scored $1,400.

How can you tell if it's pure?

If the magnet doesn't stick,
it's pure.

Toss me the freaking bag
and let's go.

How'd you know
the magnet trick?

I used to be a thief.

Tricks of the trade.

[footsteps approaching]

[heavy breathing]



No!

Jasmine.

Hey, girl.
What are you doing here?

Where's Lou Boy?
He's back there.

Why? Is everything cool?
Yeah.

You cool?
Yeah, thanks.

All right.

<i>â™ª I feel the devil â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Scratching at my back â™ª</i>

Look who the cat dragged in.

[lyrics continue indistinct]

Look, just hang loose.

All right?

All of this will blow by
in a minute.

You know, Captain Marcus
has to do his whole

horse and pony show
for the chief.

I didn't do anything wrong.

Robbie, you busted
a man's face wide open!

He had it coming.

He was handcuffed
for Christ's sake!

He was resisting arrest.

How in the hell
was he resisting

when he was already
locked in his cell?

You're killing me over here!
I needed info.

You used excessive force
when you didn't have to.

See what you don't understand,

is these people
have rights too, Robbie.

Rights?
This scumbag killed a mother

and her 14-year-old kid
all over dope.

You broke procedure!
Where were their rights?

Damn.

You just don't get it.

It was a hunch, you know.
Most police work is.

Oh, for Christ's sake.

I get it, okay.
I screwed up.

Look, I gotta get of here
before this pharmacy closes.

But on another note,

I might have something for you.

Okay, great.

The suspension's killing me.

My, uh, my girl's birthday
is coming up.

I was thinking about proposing.

Yeah, I don't about all that,
but...

I just need you
to prove something to me.

Just prove to me that I didn't
stick my neck out for you.

Okay.
Really?

Yeah, really.

So, effective tomorrow,

you're back to work.

Great.

Don't get too excited.
It's only light duty.

Desk job?!

Until you're case
comes through IAD.

This sounds like shit.

Well, all you gotta do

is pick up a couple runaways.

Alissa Nolan
and Karla Montgomery.

They escaped from...
You're kidding me?

No, I'm not.

Babysitting?

You ungrateful son of a...

Look, you just go find them,

take them back
to where they belong,

to the halfway house.

Okay?

Take them to Father Peter.

Piece of cake, no issues.

Just book 'em
and take 'em away.

â™ªâ™ª

[knocking on door]

Hello, how may I help you?

Hi, I'm Detective Kimble,
I'm here to see Sister Ruth.

Yes, we've been expecting you.

I'm Father Michael.
Why don't you follow me?

I don't like it either.

Budget and faculty issues
have put this house

on a very short list to possibly
merge with a state institution.

Shame.

a memory if it ever happens.

How many inmates are here?

I mean residents.
How many do you have?

Well, Detective, you wouldn't
believe the work that's been put in

from the staff
and the girls here.

Shame.

Candy, what are you
doing with that box?

I see, but how many ladies
are here on sight?

Sorry, I-I didn't mean to
disturb your meeting.

Father Peter just asked me
to drop this off in his office.

[heavy footsteps]

â™ªâ™ª

you didn't answer me regarding

how many women and staff
are usually on the grounds.

Just a handful of staff.

About 12 or so residents.

We feel keeping the residents
at a minimum helps their focus.

No distractions.

The amount is less,

but it's absolutely
more guidance to give.

I see Sister Ruth's been
already telling you

about our little problem.

Father Peter,
this is Detective...

Oh, Detective Robbie Kimble.

Detective.
Nice to meet you, Father.

Yeah, the history of faith,

love and healing
that we have here

is the reason that
when our girls are released,

they are truly
and utterly rehabilitated.

[Sister Ruth] Detective Kimble.

Please, find our girls.

I will.

Oh, things we do
before we find our calling.

Thank you, Sister Ruth.

Oh, what about security?

[Sister Ruth] Security?

Besides the lockdown timer?

Lockdown timer?
Yes.

Each night
the lockdown timer is on

from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.
the next morning.

Great, can I speak with the
security patrol that handles that?

You're looking at her.

And there is no
so-called security patrol.

Just the timer switch.

Wait...
I'm afraid that's all we have.

So, you don't have security guards
of any kind patrolling the grounds?!

Absolutely not.

That completely goes against
what we stand for.

Some of these girls
have criminal records.

You are absolutely right,
Detective.

And those same girls
have already served their time.

They come here to heal
and to be trusted once more

before we let them
back out in society.

I know the type
who usually ends up here,

they're still societies worst.

St. Matthias,
we have never had armed guards,

or security patrol,
or whatever you say it is

that we need to have
on our grounds.

Our program has worked wonders
since 1914.

Ever since
we opened the doors.

Father, Detective.

[Father Peter] Sister, could you do me a favor...
Yes?

...and please make sure
that that box sees upstairs?

Yes, of course.

I'll make sure
one of the girls retrieves it.

Thank you.

Nineteen-fourteen.

Didn't know this place
was around then.

Yeah, yeah, the history
of this place is just...

I swear, you just feel it
in the walls, you know.

As a matter of fact, Father Thomas
who actually founded our organization,

he took his motivation
from another mission

that he had been
a part of in San Diego.

They say that we get the motivation
for, uh, for our bell tower.

I didn't know that.

Look at you.

Can you help me with these?
Yeah.

Have you seen the detective?
He's cute.

Meh, not my type.

Ladies,
have you seen Sister Ruth?

I think she went to go see
Sister Francis.

Thank you.

Sister Ruth...

[medical monitor beeping]

What's a matter with you, Nikki?

Okay...
[clears throat]

I'm sorry, Sister Francis, um,

I forgot your dish and glass.


Sister Ruth, I'm...

I'm-I'm sorry.

You startled me and...

[glass clinking]

Um, so 16 including
Montgomery and Nolan?

Uh...
Excuse me, Father.

Uh, Sister Ruth
sent me to grab a box?

There.

Thank you, Kacy.

Uh, no, I believe it's
nine or ten at the moment.

Yummy.
[Father Peter] We had a few girls that, uh,

that finished the program and
then a few that ran away, so...

More runaways?

No. No, no, no,
Just-just the two.

Is this true? Both girls are now
set for an earlier release date

than they were
originally sentenced?

Yes, uh, both girls
were showing great promise.

So we made them a part
of our Big Sister program

which made the eligible
for early release.

What's that?
What's what?

Big Sister program.
Uh, it is a program

that we invented
several years ago where

it allowed for some of
the best and brightest

to further their own rehabilitation
by helping other girls.

It's one of the things
we're able to do here

with, uh, such small numbers
in our family atmosphere.

If they were doing so well
what triggered them to run?

I, uh, I would imagine
you'll have to

ask them that yourself
when you find them, Detective.

[scoffs]
Uh, we have a very, very busy day going on here,

and I believe I've given you
everything I possibly can so,

please, excuse me,
I have to get to a group session now.

What about Trina Mathews?

What about Trina Mathews?

Did you know her?

No, I saw her name on the box.

Oh! [chuckles]
Yeah, um...

Uh, she was one of the girls that,
uh, recently finished our program.

Great. Great.
Good for her.

I applaud anyone who gets their shit
together and changes their life.

Bravo to you guys.
Thank you.

Mm-hm. Oh, one last thing,

I didn't see
any last residence

or even the last employment
for Alissa Montgomery.

Nolan.
Huh?

Alissa Nolan.
Oh.

Yeah, Alissa Nolan,
Karla Montgomery.

Um, Miss Nolan used to
bounce around a lot.

I believe the only thing
that we had on her

was that she used to periodically
work at some biker bar in Levittown?

Anyway, Detective,
please, excuse me.

I pray to God that you bring our
girls back safe and sound soon.

[chuckles] I will.
Thank you.

<i>Other runaways?</i>

[Father Peter]
<i>No, no, just-just the two.</i>

<i>What about Trina Mathews?
Did you know her?</i>

Hey, have you seen FP?

I-I don't know
who FP is, sorry.

You were just talking to him.

FP?
Father Peter!

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

He's off
at a counseling session.


[soft chuckle]

Okay.

â™ªâ™ª


[lighter flicks]

You a coppa?

A...

A coppa?
People still say that?

I do.
Hm.

Can I bum one of those?

Hm, sure.

You here for Karla and Alissa?

Yeah.

Yeah, you know
their whereabouts?


Thank God they had the balls
to get the hell out of here.

This place isn't right.

People disappear on a regular.

Hm.

Surprised they
called the cops this time.

This time?

Yeah, I've been here,
I see shit.

What kind of shit?

I think you're
only gonna find one girl.

Oh, yeah. Why's that?

Because she's dead.

Gone. Taken.

Just like the others.

What are you sayin'?

It's this place.
They never leave, they just...

go somewhere.

And how did you know?
Because I hear shit.

Shit that will leave you
with nightmares.

Just like all the others
that disappeared.

Others?
They only told me about the two.


What about last month?

And the month
before that, hm?

Some stay, others vanish.

We'll find your friends
and then hopefully

you can move on
like all the others.

Move on?!

No one really moves on.
Yeah.

Like Trina Mathews.

Did they feed you that shit

about Trina being rehabilitated?

Uh, she was one of
the girls that, uh,

recently finished our program.

Mandi!

Shouldn't you be in
group session?!

Hey, do you know
where Alissa works?

Used to work?

Yeah, down at
the Pennywhistle.

In Levittown.

Find Alissa.

Thanks for the smoke.

Detective,
this is a smoke free zone!

I do not appreciate you
encouraging our girls to smoke!

Sorry, Sister.
Sorry.

Get in.

[Father Peter]
So...

Father Michael
has shared with all of us

his own story

and his challenges

and how he made his way
back to God.

He's gonna be here with us
for the next few months,

and starting next Monday

he's gonna be
taking over this session.

Okay?

Let's get started.

Who wants to go first?

Kacy.

I don't wanna go first.

Have things been getting
any easier on you?

You have no idea how hard it is
to stay clean and celibate.

And on the other hand...

about hooking, so...

[soft chuckle]

That's good.

Iris.

[Father Michael] Hm.
Well, it's not gonna happen overnight.

Hm.
This kind of stuff takes time.

Uh, time, as they say, uh,
time heals all wounds.


[Father Peter]
Nikki!

Do you have something
constructive to add?

Okay.

Ladies, we're all very worried
about Karla and Alissa, okay?

All of us.

But the police
are going to find them,

and they are gonna bring them
back home to us, okay?


they say, uh, that, uh,

they never
left the building.

Hm?

Who's they?

Are you... are you
talking about the girls?

You know,
the group that knows everything.

This know, you know, they say.

They!

Well, "you" said that "they"

might have never left the building.
[exhales]

Are you, uh, suggesting that
somehow they are still here

maybe hiding or something?
[scoffs]

You...

You wanna tell us something
about any girls

that disappeared, Father?

Hey. Hey. It's cool.

Father Peter said that the cops
will bring her back, right?

I met the detective today.

Seems like he has
his shit together, you know.

When did you meet the detective?

[monitor beeping]

[Sister Ruth]
We need you better.

I need you better.

And Peter.

Father Peter,
he wants the same, as well.

I'm worried.

I'm worried about
both of you, actually.

I want to hear some stories
about courage and strength.

M'kay?

Who wants to start?

Me.
Kacy.

Drop your hand down.

You know, you don't have

either courage or strength.

We don't want to
be here all day.

I've got shit to do.

Cut it out, Jennifer.
Let her talk.

No one's talking to you, Red.

I'm aware,

just let the girl
speak her peace.

[in a southern accent]
Okay? Bless your heart.

Who's that supposed to be?
Me?

Bitch, I will cut you!

Period head.
Ouch.

Ladies! Is there some sort
of a problem over there?

Kacy has something to say,
but Jennifer is being her usual

controlling country
and bitchy self.

You got something to say,
cupcake?

Cupcake? Bitch, I will box

that stupid look
right off your face.

Oh, you're all tough
over there,

while you're
mumbling to yourself.

Why don't you
say it loud, cupcake!

Whoa! Ladies! Ladies!

I'll bet you!
Yeah, try it!, Try it!

Ladies! Ladies! Ladies!
[overlapping chatter]

[Father Peter]
Ladies!

Yeah, I'll kick your ass

all the way back to Tennessee
where you came from.

Tennessee, you stupid bitch? I'm a Texan!
Ohh!

Francis...

do you remember
when we took this picture

outside of that restaurant?

You loved it there.

La Ginestra.

That was the name
of the Italian restaurant.

Do you remember that place,
Francis?

It's been three months that I
haven't cut into myself, so, yay me.

Yeah, I mean,
I feel it at times.

I think about
dark depression shit...

I think about it a lot,
actually.

I'll think about
doing the cutting.

I'll look down my arms
and see all my scars.

I think about my Mom
and how she was so selfish.

And how she cared
more about the needle

than feeding
her own children food.

I'll think about the night that I
found her in the tub, all bled out.

I felt... alone.

Scared, empty.

Feelings I wouldn't want
anyone to feel.

I know one day
I want to have a kid of my own,

show them that I care,
that I'm there for them.

That I'd do anything
to-to protect them.

Be a real mom.

Not one who bails out
when shit gets hard.

Um, Sara.

Yeah, Mandi, do you
have something else?

May I be excused?

That memory
just made me nauseous.

Totally,
I totally understand.

â™ªâ™ª


[footsteps approaching]

â™ªâ™ª

Barbarians.

And I cut his throat...

[mimic slicing sound]

...from ear to ear.

I killed my stepdad.

I was free.

I... popped open a beer.

I... [sniffles]

I sat on the sofa, and I just...
I just watched <i>The Magic Garden.</i>


My Mother came home
and she was really pissed.



She screamed and just, like,
called the cops and she's like,

"What kind of kid
kills their parent?!"

And I'm like, "Me!
Move outta of the way, you bitch!"

â™ªâ™ª


Oh, shit!
Okay.


[water splashing]

[bird squawking]

[cell phone vibrates]

Oh, man, who the hell...?


Hey. Wanted to check in.

Oh, hey, uh,
you got perfect timing.

I was just about
to get in the shower.

Any news on those two girls?
No, not yet.

I'm about to check out one of
the girl's last employments

before she
got herself arrested.

At this time?

They open now?

Yeah, about to pop into
the Pennywhistle.

What the hell is a Pennywhistle?

Some biker club.
[exhales]

Do I have to remind you
to keep shit cool?

I mean, you and clubs, well...

You and aggressive people
don't get along too good.

It's all good.
I'm just gonna check it out

then probably call it a night.

All right, well, no hero shit.

No, just babysittin'.

Keep me posted.
Right.

[monitor beeping]

[footsteps approaching]

Sister Francis,
are you calling me?


Oh, God.


Oh, God, no, no, no!

No, no!


Oh, my...

[screams]
[growls]

Father Peter?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Peter?

Sister Francis, what are you
doing coming up here?

Peter.
Peter?

Father Peter?

What about him?

It's not working anymore.

Let me get you back to your room.
[hisses]

Stay away!

This isn't working.

Francis!
Don't!

I have to go.

[Sister Ruth]
Francis!

[indistinct chatter]
[giggling]

Shh, guys, here she comes.
Here she comes.

Girls, we had a great day today.

Tomorrow,
right after choir practice

we are going to watch
a special movie

in the recreational room.

Tonight is poker night.

Mandi, once you're finished,

I put a tray in the kitchen
for Sister Francis.

I'd like you
to take it up to her.

Yeah...
I can do it

Thank you, Iris,

but I really want Mandi
to do it tonight.

It-it's no big deal.
I-I like doing it.

Next time.

Mandi?

Yeah, sure, I'll do it.

When I was downstairs
cleaning today,

I found these.

They wouldn't happen
to be yours would they?

No, that'd be against the rules.

Okay, well, I guess I'll just
throw them into the trash.

And, Mandi, remember to keep
the door closed.

Sister Francis
doesn't like the breeze.

Oh, well, that door
is heavier than a bank vault.


Well, I'll tell Father Peter

that you're bringing her
to dinner tonight.

And that you might be a little
bit late for game night.

What'd you do
to piss her off, Mandi?

She doesn't seem to
like ya very much.

Yeah, I know.

Well, tell us.

Unsure.
Maybe she saw you smoking downstairs?

You know how that makes her go
all freakin ape shit and stuff.

You know?

No.

Oh, yeah,
actually, she did.

She saw me
smoking with that cop outside.

See there,
that's what it was.

You know,
I can still do it for you.

I really don't care.

Okay.

Go for it.

Really?
Yeah.

Really.

[soft chuckle]

It's my turn anyway.

Because Kasey
does it on Tuesday,

Candy is on Wednesday...
Iris, it's cool! Go for it!

Do it.
You can go down there and do it.

Really?
Yeah, really.

Yeah.
Thank you.

You know, I like to read
to her when I'm down there.

Wow.

She has some really cool
photos on her wall.

From back in the day.

Shit, girl.

I didn't know you
liked the gig like that.

You can have my place, too.

Really?

Hell, girl,
you can take my slot, too.

take my spot too?

â™ªâ™ª

[rock music playing]

All right, thanks.

We all good now?

Yeah.
All right.

Been a long time, right?

So who you running from, what?
Jealous boyfriend,

ripped off dealer?

that you would
need to come to me

for so much firepower?

Yeah.

Yeah.
What are you, like,

part gypsy or something?

Like from Yugoslavia, right?

No, my family is Albanian.

Yeah, Yugoslavia.

There hasn't been a Yugoslavia
in, like, almost 30 years.

I asked you.

Who's got you running from them?

I can handle.
You can handle shite! Huh?

You disappear on me,

you get picked up
for dealing molly.

What the hell's wrong with you?

I warned you about that stuff

when you were dancing here.

Now who has got you running?!

You're gonna talk to me.

You show back up at my place
with the goddamn cops.

Cops? What are you crazy?

What kind of games
are you playing with me?

I warned you a long time ago
not to mess with me.

Is that how you
got out so early?

You made a deal against me?
No, no, I-I-I didn't.

Man, I wanna believe you.

Then who is that,
in my freaking bar?

I don't know that guy.
Oh, yeah?

I swear to God,
you have to believe me,

I-I swear, I don't know him.

Well, let's find out.

Can I help you with something:

Yeah, I noticed you guys
were looking at me over there.

Well, I was looking at you,
just wanted to say hello.

He's a comedian.
What are you looking for?

I'm Detective Kimble, look,

I don't want
any trouble tonight.

I don't care
what you guys do here,

I'm only here for her.

Do you know this guy? Hey!
No, I-I don't.

You don't wanna start
any trouble with me,

I'm only here to take you
back to St. Matthias.

Well, why do you
need to take her back?

Well, she's still under
the state's jurisdiction,

and until she is no longer she's
gonna need to be at St. Matthias.

Yeah, well, screw the state,
and screw you,

she's not going anywhere.

Hey, I'm sorry
you feel that way, pal.

I'm under orders
to escort her back.

You and I have no beef.

She is not going anywhere.
Don't do that.

Where's your friend?
C'mon, you can go with me tonight.

You'll stay.
Hey, you can't do that.


[rock music playing]


Hey!
I'mma make you my bitch!

Got your bitch right here.

[bartender] Hey!
Hey!

You think I'm fooling around?

Put the gun down now, bitch!

Now!

Next guy gets a bullet
in the face!

You're coming with me now!

Don't fight me, Nolan!

No.
Let 'em go, let 'em go.

Hey, Gypsy...

happy hunting.

[monitor beeping]


You sound like
a-a wood farmer from Greece.

Goodnight, Sister Francis.

â™ªâ™ª

Who the hell are you?

A church bounty hunter?

No, I'm Detective Kimble.

I'm here to bring you
and your friend back.

You wanna tell me
where Montgomery is?

She's not with me.

Well, no shit.
That I can see, genius.

Where is she at?

She's dead.
You're full of shit.

She is dead.
Shut up.

Why the gun?

Who's after you?

Not who, more like what.

So you bought a gun
off these guys for what?

I'm gonna ask you again,
where is Karla Montgomery?

I told you, she's dead.

She never made it
out of the building with me.

Something took her.

Something...
Who did?

Something, an animal.
[scoffs] Animal?

At the half way house?
You too, huh?

It's not a good place.

People go missing,
people die every month.

Yeah, I heard.

Silver bullets?

You got a werewolf problem
at this church?

What?

Huh.

Eww.

No wonder that biker
called you a gypsy.

Is this the story?

I was planning to head back
and kill it.

Kill what?
The thing.

I'm sure it will bleed out
with a few of those.

Anything will bleed out
when you shoot it.

Maybe it is a wolf.

Maybe it's
the only logical explanation.

People... people disappear every
month during the full moon.

Are you high?

A freakin werewolf, c'mon!

Look, I don't know what it was,

but I saw it kill Karla
and God knows who else.

It must have killed
many of the girls.

You know how nuts this sounds?

The priest and nun said
that you were a role model.

So you wanna tell me
why you really ran away?

No one ever gets away.

They get you.

One by one.
Yeah.

Redheaded girl at your house
said the same thing.

Look, I'm sure people left
that place without incident.


Say I believe you.

Why would they report you and
Karla as runaways to the police?

How else can they get away
with what they're doing?

They have to say something.

They call you guys,
you come look for us,

can't find us, case closed.

No one gives a shit
about runaways in the system.

Something ate my friend!

Uh, this is Rosita's shirt



[screaming]
[growling]

Okay, so you're saying...

people disappear from this place
all the time

and nobody knows about it.
Some do.

And the nun and the priest
that I met are in on it.

That's your story?
I heard that Father Peter isn't a real priest,

he's protecting
whatever is in the...

For shit's sake...
I watched Karla get killed!


<i>She reached out with her bag.</i>
[screaming]

I saw this thing...

come out of the darkness...

and freaking chomped down
on her arm!

And it dragged her away.

You saw this?

Oh, my God, have you not
been listening to me?

Hey, kid, look, I don't know what
goes on over in that place, okay.

Obviously, something scared you
bad enough for you to run away,

and to buy a gun
with plans to use it.

You believe me now?


Look, I'll tell you what...

[sniffling]
When I take you back,

you and I will go on
a tour of that place.

We'll figure shit out.

Okay?

Thank you.

What you'd say your name was?

Robbie Kimble.

Nice to meet you, Robbie.

I am Alissa Nolan.

Nice to meet you, Alissa.

[engine starts]

I forgot my snack.

No, I'm good.

All right, well,
I'm going back downstairs

to play the game,
are you coming?

Nah, I think
I'm gonna do some reading

and call it a night.

Okay.

Suit yourself, Sister.

Later.
Later.

What now?

What are you doing in here?

I thought you were taking Sister
Francis her dinner this evening?

Uh, yeah...

Iris wanted to do it,
so I-I let her do it.

[sighs softly]

Everything okay?

Yes!

Have you seen Father Michael?

He never made it
down to the game.

Well, he's not here.

I can see that.

All right, Michael,

come out from under there,
she caught us.

I fail to see
the humor in that.

I thought it was funny.

Sister Ruth...

I was wondering, um...

do you happen to know where
Nikki or Rosita are?

Just never saw them
at dinner tonight.

Yes.

They went to the store
with Father Peter.

[girls laughing]

[indistinct chatter]


Hey, if you're a priest,
why you wearing a wedding band?

Well, priests and all nuns
are married to God.

Whoa, that's weird.

Mm-hm.
Yeah, interesting.

I'm out.

[groans]
What?

You can't quit after you win,
that sucks.

My father
didn't raise no fool.

[all chuckle]

[upbeat music playing]
Ooh!

Whoo, girl.
All right!

We're gonna have some fun.
[indistinct chatter]

Yeah, get it, girl.
Whoo, shake it.

Okay, strip...
Whoo!

Whoo! Whoo!

Bring it over here, Sister.
Whoo!

All right!
Yeah, yeah!

[all laughing]

Four dollars?

Is that really
all I'm worth to you?

Bitch, you're lucky I had that.
[all laughing]

Aww, Sara, come over here
and dance for me, girl.

I got a ten spot for you.
Oww!

That song. Oh, yeah,
that's my jam right there.

Yes ma'am.
Yeah, let's do it.

Yes!
[laughing]

Hey, can we play again?

Leave me alone.

I don't even know
why you're down here.

Nobody likes you ass.

[Father Michael]
Ladies...

Don't say that to her.

I'm sure they're just kidding.

Yo, Father New Guy...

She's not that bad...
...don't put words in my mouth.

You don't know her,
she's crazy.

It's Father Michael,
not Father New Guy.

Okay, Father Time Checker.

But can we
get another game though?

It's getting late.

I have to lock up, do rounds.

You have time
for one more quick game.

Yes, yes!
Yes! All right, ladies!

Yo, Kacy, you deal.


Yo, Father Michael's
kind of hot.

Eww.
He's a priest.

What the hell is wrong with you?

See, that's what
I'm talking about,

that's why no one
likes your ass.

I guess I've just been
locked up here for too long.

Girl, c'mon,

it's only been four days.

It's been eight weeks for me.

I'm outta here, I gotta pee.
[all laughing]

God, if I was here that long
I would OD.

And that's why your ass
is locked up.

She's got a point.

[crickets chirping]

Hold on.

[car beeping]

You do believe me?

Kid, I don't believe in fables,

fairy tales, or happy endings.

Vampires, zombies
or even werewolves.

I do believe you
saw something in there

that spooked you
and your friend.

What about monsters?

Well, monsters do exist.
They're called human beings.

I've seen humans do a lot of
shit that'd make your head spin.

Let's move.

â™ªâ™ª

[alarm buzzing]

What's going on?

The lockdown has started.

Until 6:00 a.m.
the next morning?

I'm looking for Father Peter
or Sister Ruth.

I believe they already
retired for the evening.

May...
You found her?

No luck for Karla?
Yeah, about that,

is there some place we can talk?

Yes, we can talk in the chapel.

Father, that is our precious
Alissa Nolan who was AWOL.

Can you please see
that she gets to her room

while I speak with
the detective?

Detective?
Yeah, I'mma need her

to stay with us a bit, thanks.

Sister?

Thank you,
I can take it from here.

Go do your rounds.

Follow me.

â™ªâ™ª

[monitor beeping]

â™ªâ™ª

Sister Francis?

â™ªâ™ª

[door creaking]

Is that you?

Sister Francis?

Red?
Yeah, it's me, Mandi.

What are you doing here?

Well, um, I was just gonna...

And what is it
that you have with you?

I think there's something
going on and, I'm...

Come closer.

Closer.

I can't hear you too well.

Well, I-I was
just gonna tell you that.

What have you brought for me?

You're hurting my arm, Sister.

Better to hold onto you,
my dear.

Your-your grip, Sister,
it's hurting my arm

[inhales]
Sister, let go.

Karla...

Let go of me!

Sister Francis, your grip.


Holy shit.


Holy...



Mandi, what are you
doing down here?


Sister Francis?

[Father Michael yelling]
[growling]

[soft growling]



â™ªâ™ª

[soft growling]

â™ªâ™ª


This is ludicrous.

And what are your concerns,
Miss Nolan?

What have we done for you
besides help you and guide you?

That's what I'd like to
find out as well, Sister.

So do you mind if we take a
closer look around St. Matthias?

Absolutely not!

You would need a warrant
for that detective.

This is the house of the Lord!

Now, please,
let me show you out.

You're right, I don't have
a search warrant,

but I do have probable cause

to believe that Karla Montgomery
never left the premises.

Where do you wanna start?

[Father Peter]
We should start in the basement.

Hmm?

I mean, that's the last place
that you were both seen.

So we should start there.

Eight-ball, corner pocket.

Bitch, please.


You just hit me
with the freaking door!

[indistinct chatter]

Oh, my God!

Mandi!

[gasps]
[screaming]

Help!
Someone help!


[growling]
[screaming]


â™ªâ™ª

[soft growl]


What the fu...




I heard gun shots.
I think they got it.

Do you think
we should check?

No, no, no, sister,
were gonna sit our asses in here

until they come for us.


I ran my Texas ass off.

It knocked me down hard

in the back for a bit,
but I think I'm okay now.

[panting] I think I lost it.
Jenny, where is that thing?

Don't know.

I'm gonna go to the room
and get some towels.

No, don't go.

You need to go in the room
with Sara and sit down.

Go in the room.

Sara.
Yeah, try to come inside.

I don't feel so good.
I know, come inside.


Help!

Help!
[growls]

[Jenny screaming]

[Sara panting]




<i>Howie, I need backup, now!</i>

Bring everything you got to St.
Matthias halfway house, now.


â™ªâ™ª

[soft growling]


â™ªâ™ª


Sister Francis?


[yelling in distance]


Not gonna let you kill her.


Where's the emergency key?


I know it's in here somewhere.

â™ªâ™ª


I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

[grunts]
[gunshot]



Robbie?

Robbie?



Father Peter?

â™ªâ™ª

You know, we were on
our honeymoon when it happened.

We just got married and...

we went down to Brazil

to visit Ruth
on one of her missions.

There was something
in the woods.

And it bit her hand.

And she started to change.

Once my wife started to change,

then... Ruth and I, we knew.

We hoped, we prayed that
we could...

That we could cure her.

So we brought her here
and we hid her.

living this lie for ten years.

But as things kept going,
she just got worse,

started getting
more aggressive...

more just... hungry.

And we put in that door
to control her,

and... eventually,
I couldn't even give her meat...

from the market anymore.

It had to be alive.

So you started to feed her us?

Oh, my God, what have we done?

We, uh, we...

We gave her
the program's undesirables.

The ones we didn't think
anyone would miss.

Why did you need to kill,
Robbie?

He would have hurt her.

I swore I'd never let anyone
hurt my wife.

Your wife is a monster!

Not to me.

â™ªâ™ª




â™ªâ™ª

[alarm buzzing]

Hey.

You all right?

Considering a werewolf
ate our friends

and I shot a fake priest dead...

We survived.

Uh, I'm gonna go get some help.

My dad's a lawyer.

The phone in office is trashed.

I took the cop's.
