[coyote howling]

â™ª You've got the magic touch â™ª

â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

â™ª It makes me glow so much â™ª

â™ª It casts a spell â™ª

â™ª It rings a bell â™ª

â™ª The magic touch â™ª

â™ª Oh, when I feel your touch â™ª

â™ª It's like a four-alarm â™ª

[car door slams]

[heavy breathing]

[ominous music]


[crickets chirping]

[thunder rumbles]

[thunder rumbles]

[dramatic music]


â™ª The glow â™ª
[coughs]

â™ª But where can I go â™ª

â™ª From you â™ª
Oh, what the holy fuck?

â™ª I didn't know too much â™ª
Oh, Jesus.


â™ª And then I felt your touch â™ª


[thunder rumbling]
â™ª And now I've learned â™ª

â™ª I can return â™ª

[man laughing]

â™ª The Magic Touch â™ª

â™ª Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo â™ª

â™ª Doo, doo, doo, doo â™ª

[bell dinging]


Morning, Paulette.

[bell dings]

Thank you very much.

Thanks.
Bye.

Hi, Kelly.
Hi, Dominique.

See you in history.

Yeah.

See... see ya.

Why Kelly?
I mean like, really, Dom?

Well, he was the only one nice to me
when I first moved here.

That was like 10 years ago.

Okay.

[car engine rumbling]

[car doors slamming]

Check it out, boys.

It's the human garbage disposal.

Look at this miserable
piece of shit.

Hey!
Where do you think you're goin'?

Hey.

Answer the question, Trash Boy.

Yeah, answer the question,
Trash Boy.

coming here before school.


Leave him alone.

You guys are such jerks!

Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is
just guy stuff, Dominique.

[laughing]
Hey.

Don't touch her.

What the fuck did you just say?

What the fuck he say?

You're going dumpster
diving for that.

Think so.

To the dump!


Ladies and gentlemen!

Trash Boy has won himself
an all you can eat buffet.

Stop it!

Oh, and a free soda
to wash it all down.



Get the hell outta here!

I'll call the cops on you!

[engine revving]
[rock music playing on radio]

[tires screeching]

[engine roaring]

Hey, hey, it's okay,
they're gone now.

I'm... I'm sorry, Kelly.
I didn't mean to make it worse.

I don't know why
they always pick on you.

We can't be late to school, Dom.

Do you want a ride?
Uh, my dad would kill me

if he gets slime on the seats.

It's okay,
but thanks for asking.

[somber music]

[engine starts]


[school bell rings]

[bike squeaking]

[rock music playing in distance]

[school bell rings]

[indistinct chattering]



[boy 2 over phone speaker]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

<i>Trash Boy has won himself...</i>

[boy 3] Check it out, man!
[students laughing]

[indistinct chattering]

What the fuck?

I'm so... I'm so sorry.
Are you blind, bitch?

No, Tucker, I really...

[mock stuttering] What?

I'm so sorry.

The fuck outta here.

[school bell rings]

[dog barking]
[bike squeaking]

the groceries, honey.

How was school?

was nice to me.

Oh, I miss her.

You two used to hang
out all the time.

That was middle school, Mom.

You should ask her out!

And I need that receipt.

[dog barking]

I need you to take those,

I need you to start to
rip it apart for me, okay?

Then put them in the bowl.

All right?
Now Mommy will cut all these up.

Hey! How was school?
Fine.

I would love to have some
help with dinner tonight.

You know that I can't.

Oh, I know.

You're busy with
track and homework

and the study group or theater.

And I'm proud of you.

[phone chimes]

Anyone special?

No, it's Nelson.

Again.

I thought you were just crazy
about him a couple of weeks ago.

Yeah, well, he bullied
one of my friends today.

I could never like
a guy like that.

Well, honey, maybe
he was just showing off.

Do you think Nelson felt
your friend was his competition?

I doubt it.
Do you remember Kelly?

Kelly?

The weird kid that used to eat
paper and pencils and stuff?

Really, Mom?
You too?

What?
What did I say?

You know what?
Forget it.


[tense music]

[dramatic music]

[tense music]


How's, uh,
how's your appetite, buddy?

For garbage, Doctor,
it's excellent.

I thought you said
he was gonna outgrow this.

Pica is not uncommon
in children.

But most kids do outgrow it.

Maybe it's just
the flu this time.

It's going around, you know.

because of the flu, Kelly.

You're sick because of
your eating disorder.

You're malnourished.

Have you at least been
taking your iron pills?

Yeah.

I take those every day.

Bernice.

I don't see this
as a dietary issue,

I think it's psychological.

I think it's time that
Kelly talked to someone.

Do we really need
another doctor?

Kelly has an obsession
he cannot control.

He needs help to work through
his compulsive behavior.

Mom.

I'll be okay.

Thank you so much for
making the house call,

I really appreciate it.
Anytime, Bernice.

Let's have dinner.

I think a man's influence
would be good for Kelly.

[scoffs]
[dog barking in distance]

I'll let you know.

He's got a crush on you.

No!

I got a crush on you!

I love you.

I love you.

Reverend Pflueger is my name,

and healing is my game.

I know I look like two
box cars bumped together

and I rolled out
of a hobo's ass,

but I had a rough night.

I'm a man.

[scoffs]
[Pflueger] I'm just a man.

But the good Lord above
gave me a gift.

It's my life mission to share
that gift to His flock.

With these hands,

I could take away
anything that ails you,

whatever ails you.

With my touch,
you will be free from pain.

Is there anyone here
that could use my gift?

Anyone?

You.

What part of your body
has failed you, dear lady?

My back and my legs.

They're in excruciating pain.

Now, we're gonna fix that.

Yeah, please donate
to the healing jar...

[woman] Oh.
...to empower my hands.

Together, we share
everything in this life.

He will give energy
to my healing hands

that God has bestowed upon me.

And I will heal you.

What part of your
leg really hurts you?



Oh, Lord, Lord.

In this moment,
just give me the healing power

to heal this woman's leg.

To take the pain away.

Heal this woman that she
might throw this walker away

to the side of the road.

[ominous music]
[groaning]

Wait, did you hear that crack?

Did you hear it?

Now tell me how you feel?

I think...

It's a miracle!
Yes!

[woman] It's a miracle!
Just throw that walker to the side.

Throw it to
the side of the road.

[man] Praise the Lord!
I have no more pain.

Praise Jesus!
Hallelujah!

[man] Hallelujah!
[Pflueger] Thank you.

[woman 2] Hallelujah!
Uh-huh.

Come closer,
this is not a trick!

This is not done by me,
this is done by the Lord above!

I have no pain.



[tense music]



Oh, could you?

[Pflueger] Let's do it.
Okay, sounds good.

I'm just gonna go grab my car

and then you can follow me?


Thank you.

[bird calling]

Very impressive.

How is it that you can heal?

God.

I can help you.

Excuse me?

I can help you.

Oh.
Who the fuck are you?

Red Elk.

Red Ass?
Red Elk.

Red Elk.
And I can help you

let go of the medicine.

The medicine?

My power to heal?

Why would I ever do that, Chief?

[ominous music]

[Red Elk] You cannot be harmed.

Whoever tries will
feel the pain.

It protects itself,
so it protects its host.

That is the medicine's gift.

I'm Reverend Pflueger,
the healer.

Healing is a special gift
to repair a weakness.

The medicine is purity,
but if you abuse it,

you will eventually
destroy yourself.

Who gives a fuck what
I do with my power?

It doesn't belong to you!

That grave is over
100 years old.

I protect it,
my father protected it,

my grandfather protected it.

You must give the medicine back.

Give it back?

I used to be a nobody,

and now
I'm Jesus fuckin' Christ,

and I'm gonna live forever,
Red Man.

Red Elk.

Whatever.

And you will not live forever.

Please.

Trust me.

Trust me, my brother.

I am not your fuckin' brother.

And I will never give
the power back to you.

Ever.
[car horn honking]

We're done here.

I have to go give my medicine

to this really
pretty young woman.

Adios, Chief Red Fucker.

Just... [mumbling]

You know what I mean?
Fuck you.

[truck door slams]

Hi.
[Bernice] Hi.

Yeah, so, just come in.

He's getting worse and worse.

I really hate to
see a child suffer.

But as I mentioned before,

I think we should take
care of the money first.

Because a lot of people,
you know,

they... they have
a change of heart

after I've done my work,
and you know what I mean.

Yeah, no, of course.
I have it, I have it right here.

Where the fuck is my money?

Oh, what happened?

Oh, that's okay,
I'll come back another time.

No, no, please,
no, I need you now.

Wait. There it is, sorry.


[Bernice] Thank you.
Here you hold that.

Why don't we take a look at
this boy of yours, shall we?

Okay.

[door opens]


There's someone here to see you.

This is Reverend Pflueger.

May I ask you something?
Mm-hm.

Will your husband be joining us?

No, um, Kelly's father died
before he was born, so...


Sorry to hear that.

Thank you.

You know what we're gonna do?

We're gonna make you better,

we're gonna take care of you.

[Pflueger gasping]
[ominous music]

[Pflueger groaning]

[tense music]


Are you okay?
Oh, yeah.

Before we get started,

can I use your facilities?

P... please, please?
Of course.

[Pflueger] Thank you.
Just down the hallway to the left.

Thank you, thank you...
Thank you.

[music continues]

[toilet flushing]



You feeling better?

Yeah, yeah.

[breathing heavily]

Fit as a fiddle.

Yes, one... one of the good
things about being a healer,

you don't have any...

you don't have any,
uh, illnesses...

no injuries.



Kelly.

Kelly.
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly... Kelly.

We have a lot in common,
you and me, Kelly.

Pain.

And a hope for light.


Yeah.

I only have half
a lung in my body.

Then why are you smoking?

None of your fuckin' business.

Oh, and once we start this,
there's no stopping it.

This is very powerful medicine.

We can't be interrupted.
Okay.

[ominous music]

[Pflueger coughs]

[dramatic music]

[Pflueger coughing]

[flesh sizzling]
[groaning]

[Bernice screaming]
What are you doing?


Holy shit.


I feel everything.


And it fucking hurts!


[intense music]

[dark demonic sounds]


Oh, God...

[demonic noises fade]


Go fuck yourself, kid.


Mom.

I'm hungry.

[Kelly panting]

[indistinct radio chatter]

What the hell happened?

I don't know,
but I got dibs on the boots.

I got a couple of questions.

Bernice.

I know it's been a long night,
we're almost done.

How are you feeling, Kelly?

I feel fine.

Uh, you reported
a cigarette burn?

Yeah, yeah.

It burnt a hole right on
his chest, right here.

[ominous music]


Look, either way,

we're sorry that Pflueger
was conning you

into the whole healing thing.

Mm.

[tense music]

Okay.

Look, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

Thank you, Sheriff Adler.

Appreciate that, thank you.

[music continues]

He's got a crush on you.


[dramatic music]

[door opens]

That is so cool.

I'm so tired.

I barely slept at
all last night.

I slept great.

Hug me before work.


Something awesome happened to me

after Pflueger healed me.

Look.

Why are you flipping me off?

I cut it.
And... and then boom, it healed.

And it didn't even hurt.

What are you talking about?

It healed.

Ju... just like the cigarette
burn on my chest.

Can I have some of that?

Sure.

Well, that's a good sign.

What?

You drank the soda
instead of eating the can.

Invincible.

I'm invincible.

You must be contagious.

Now I feel great.


[ominous music]

[bike squeaking]

[chain snapping]


Bike problems?

Just an old chain.

Yeah, I think you
outgrew that bike

like 10 years ago.

My God, Kelly. Last time I saw you
you were just skin and bones.

Did you take some
sort of miracle pill

while you were home sick?

You do look different.

[phone ringing]
Um, Dom,

I'll wait for you in the car.

Bye.

So...

Um...

I, um, I heard about that
guy dying at your place,

that must've been scary.

That was super weird.

But he did...

Something good came of it, it...

it's like I'm a new Kelly.

Well, I like this new Kelly.

[car horn honking]

Bye.

Bye. [chuckling]

[engine starting]

You think you have a chance
with her, Trash Boy?

She deserves anybody
but your brother.

What'd you say, freak?

[tense music]

You can't hurt me.

Oh, I bet I can, Trash Boy.

[Kelly groaning]
[ominous whooshing]

[boy groaning]

Nope.

I didn't feel it.

[groaning]
[ominous whooshing]


Amazing.

Are you done hurting me?

I'm not sure
you can take much more.

[ominous whooshing]


Strike three, you're out!


Fucking monster!

Feel free to beat me up anytime!


[soft guitar music]

Mom!

I got a job
at the pizza place today.

That's amazing!

I'm so proud of you.

I was thinking maybe
I could finally get

a... a cell phone or a new bike,

or maybe even a car.

[pounding on door]

Who knocks like that?

Stay by the truck, please.

Hi.
Hi.

Sorry to barge in on you
so late, Miss Mason.

I'm, uh, Gus Whitcomb.

I'm the football
coach at Stinson High.

Oh. Call me Bernice, please.

Okay, Bernice. Um...

Yeah, so, the reason I'm here,

my... my son, Reed, he was
attacked before school today.

Oh, that's horrible,
I'm so sorry.

Yeah, well, it's a...
it's a strange situation.

Um...

Reed says that Kelly was there.

Kelly?

Hey, honey.
Do you know anything about this?

Reed was trying to beat me up,
and well, he hurt himself instead.

He hurt him... self?

See, that just doesn't
make any sense.

Reed always picks on me.

No, I know that, but I mean...

What? Wait, wait, wait.

You know your son
bullies my son?

Have you tried to stop him?

Why? Boys will be boys.

What the fuck does that mean?

Bernice, please, I just...

No, that's Miss Mason to you
actually, Coach Whitcomb.

Okay, back to that.
Miss Mason.

Um... I just want to know
what your son knows, that's it.

Kelly, how did Reed get hurt?

I didn't beat him up if
that's what he's telling you.

No, I know... that.

I know there's no chance

of you beating up my boy,
God no. I just...

He didn't do that
to himself, did he?

Look, you may not
believe your son,

but I believe mine.

Well, something's going on here!

Right. Kelly's told you
everything he knows.

Goodnight.
[Gus] Wha...

[door slams]

You didn't hurt that boy, right?

That's the other Pflueger thing
I was gonna tell you about.

But it's easier to show you.

So slap me.

But not too hard, 'cause
I don't want you to get hurt.

Slap you?

Just... just do it.
Only a little slap.

Okay, I've never
hit you in my life,

I'm not gonna start now.
Oh, Jesus, Mom.

Then... uh...

Pinch me.


[demonic hissing]
Ow!

Invincible.

Amazing, isn't it?

[ominous music]

Nobody will ever hurt us again.

I won't let them.

[demonic hissing]
Ow!


these are all great ideas

to dream about, but...

we might be getting
carried away.

A punch or a few
pinches is one thing,

but that doesn't mean
you can stop a bullet

or withstand fire.

No, don't!

[lighter clicks]

[tense music]

Oh, my God.


Well, I could withstand
the cigarette lighter.


We've gotta keep this
between us.

You can't draw any more
attention to yourself,

promise me.

I promise.
[laughs breathily]

Wow.

You don't have any other
superpowers, do you?

Hey, do you have my hair tie?
Oh, yeah.

Thanks for letting me borrow it.
Yeah.

See you in class.
Okay.

[indistinct chattering]

[demonic hiss]
Yo! Fuck! Who did that?

I will fuck you up!

Did you do that? Hey!
[students laughing]

[mouthing words]


Okay.

So, we've read about it.

Hopefully.

There's lots of
stories about it.

So, it was mostly passed down

through fire dances and chants.

But I couldn't
find any evidence,

any real evidence of
Native American tribes

eating the heart
of their enemies.

Maybe it didn't happen.

But maybe, just maybe it did.

Hey, hey, Dom.

You dropped your hair tie.

I ate the tag.

Do you want the rest of it?

I'm really trying to cut down.

just recently a Syrian rebel

ate the heart of his enemy.

[ominous music]

[fan blowing]

I think a swim is
about the only way

to cool off the body today.

We've been down to
the river so many times.

Maybe there's a more
private way to cool down.

Private?
Oh, that feels good.

[rock music]

[door squeaks open]

What is she doing here?

You are such a bad boy.

Can I join?

I don't mind at all.

Kelly?

[music continues]

[music intensifies]

<i>You are such a bad boy.</i>

Yes!


Hey!

What is going on here?

This is important stuff!
[students laughing]


[rock music playing]
[indistinct chattering]

Go Prospectors!




Milady.
[laughing] You're hilarious.

Me and the lads are
headed to the river bend

to partake in some imbibing.

Should you feel so inclined,
please join us.

Okay, I have no idea
what the hell he said,

but I'll be there.

Yes!

Whoa!

[laughing]
Stop it! Stop! Put me down!

Oh, Dom, why you so uptight?

Whoa, Dom, why you so uptight?

You know what? Stop it.
[Kelly] Hey! Leave her alone.

Whoa! [laughing]

Back up, everyone.

It's Trash Boy here
to save the day.

Kelly, it's okay, I handled it.

No, you can't just grab
her anytime you want.


What are you gonna
do about it, pussy?

Yeah, you, uh, you scared,
Trash Boy?

It's payback time,
you little shit.

Hey, hey, hey!

Break it up, cut the crap.
Will ya?

Yeah, this is
supposed to be fun.

Yes, Milady.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
nobody makes fun of me.

Okay? Do that again and
I'll fucking kill you,

I swear to God...
Hey. What did I just say?

Save it for the game.
Ye... yes, Coach.

[indistinct chattering]

Hey.
There's always later.

Really, still?

Stop talking. Go! Unbelievable.

Come on, Tuck. Ride with us.

[tense music]

You know, Kelly...

things were hard enough for you

when you were avoiding trouble.

Now it's like
you're looking for it.

No, you're just mad about Reed.

Mad? No.

More like bewildered.

But, uh, I'll figure out
what's going on with you.

And when I do, your ass is mine.

That's not fair, Coach.

Life's not fair.

Get used to it.


There's a party
at the river bend!

Come on, come on, come on!

[music continues]

[Sarah] Dominique!
I heard you!

[rock music playing]

â™ª We can sleep all day,
sleep all day â™ª

[car engine roaring]
[hard rock music]

[Tucker laughing]
You mess with Sarah, man?

Uh, does my middle finger
smell like Sarah's skunk?


Yeah, bro!

[indistinct chattering]
[engine revs]

Woo! Sick, man, okay!


[indistinct chattering]


Woo!

[bike squeaking]

[hard rock music]

Oh! Oh, oh, shit! Bro.

Dude, it's Trash Boy.
Oh, you want to scare him?

Make him piss his pants.

Nah.
Make him shit his pants!

Let's do it!
[laughing]

Dude, this night keeps
getting better and better.

[music continues]

[car horn honking]

[indistinct chattering]

[car horn honking]

Fuck him up.

[laughing]
[Tony] Get right up on his ass.

[Tucker laughs] Do it!

[music continues]

â™ª I'll be the enemy â™ª

â™ª Enemy â™ª

â™ª I'll be the enemy, enemy â™ª
[car horn honking]

[car tires squealing]

â™ª I got a brand new â™ª

â™ª I got a brand new â™ª

â™ª I got a brand new â™ª

â™ª I got a brand new,
brand new â™ª

[engine roaring]
[tires screeching]

Dude, dude, dude!
Whoa, Brad, whoa, Brad!

[engine roaring]


Rev it up, bro.

[engine revving]
[indistinct chattering]

[boys shouting]

Wooo!

Pedal, boy, pedal!

[music continues]

[grunting]
Oh, shit!

[demonic roar]
[tires screeching]

Ah, fuck!

[boys groaning]

Oh, man.

[Tucker] You all right, man?
Yeah, I'm good.

[dramatic music]
Oh, shit.

Brad.
What?

Brad.
Oh...

Hey, buddy.


[ominous music]

What the fuck?

Dude.
[gurgling]

Brad. Shit, bro.

Hey, we're gonna get
you some help, man.

Get the fuck out of the car!

Get me outta here.
Come on, get out!

[gasping, coughing]

He's not breathing.

Call 911.

it's under Brad's seat.


Bro!

Fuck!

Oh, shit, bro, Kelly.

I thought Brad ran him over.

My fuckin' brother was right.

Why couldn't you all
just leave me alone?

Look what you've done!


[ominous music]

[owl hoots]

[crickets chirping]

[eerie music]

That's Brad's car!

[dramatic music]

Oh, my God!

Where's Tony?

They took off down the road,
after they hit me.

Are you hurt?

[mumbling indistinctly]


I was riding my bike home

and they came after
me in Brad's car.

They ran you over with the car?

[Sarah whimpering]

That's why I brought 'em out as
soon as they came to the house,

because they... they were
in shock,

talking all this nonsense.


Where's Kelly?
Bernice, Kelly seems to be okay.

He's over here.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, are you okay?

No one talks any of
that horseshit nonsense.

You got it?
Okay.

I haven't talked to Kelly yet,

so please don't go anywhere
until I release him.


Kelly, what happened?

Brad and those guys
ran me over with their car.

All the wounds transferred
to Brad and killed him.

We're supposed to
keep that between us.

I won't tell anybody, I promise.

Tell him what happened.

Kelly wa... uh,
Kelly was riding his bike

in the middle of the road,

and then Brad swerved
to avoid hitting him

and, uh, lost control
and wrecked.

The airbag blew up
in his face and killed him.

himself in front of the car?

Almost like he was daring us to.

Tucker, what'd you see?

Dumbass was riding his bike
in the middle of the road.

There's no way
you can tell the truth.

Your mom's right.

Okay, so...

I got thrown off my bike
and in the bushes.

It's a miracle
I didn't get hurt.

I got dibs on the car.

[bird squawks]

[tense music]

And then you'll
destroy yourself.

The whole town knows
about your accident.

Let's hope that
the cops stick with

the airbag malfunction theory.

Yo. Bros, we gotta do
something about that.

Not me, I have no
death wish, bro.

Hey. You're either with us
or against us.

So make up your mind, dildo.

Grow some balls, man.

Yeah, like Brad?

Geez.
Come on, man.

Is that your lunch?

Yeah.
I love rice cakes.

Those things taste
like styrofoam.

You want one?

Well, they are on
my diet plan, so...

Oh, pass the peanut butter.


Tonight, Trash Family begins
their journey out of trailer town.

[boys laughing]

I don't like all the attention.

I just want things
to go back to normal.

Normal? You?


They're gonna forget
about this soon.

Just stick with me, okay?

Dude, there's so many
other girls at this school.

Just let Kelly have Dominique.

Bro, this isn't about Dominique,

it's a tribute to Brad, asshole.

Hey, um, you know the new
<i>Halloween</i> is out.

Oh, yeah! I was really wanting
to see that one.

Yeah.

Um, are you... are you doing
anything this week?

I don't think so.

No, I think I'm...

Yeah, you know, school stuff.


Okay.
Well, I better get to class.

So...
Okay.

Talk later?
Yeah.

I'll talk to you later.

Really, that's... that's it?

Oh. Um...

Want to go to the movies Friday

and check out that
new <i>Halloween</i> movie?

Yes, okay.
Okay. [laughing]

Okay, all right.
All right.

I'll see you Friday.
Friday.

Okay, bye.
All right, bye.



[indistinct chattering]

[soft music playing]

Yo. Shifts up.

I got this.

See ya, bro.

Ow! God! That's really hot.

So sorry.
Just...

Go, go.

Don't forget the trash.

[dog barking]

[Red Elk] Are you Kelly Mason?

[ominous music]

Yeah.
Are you the kid who got hit by the car?

Yeah.

Strange.

You don't look like
you got hurt at all.

I was very lucky.

A bush broke my fall.

You knew Pflueger.

The Reverend came to my trailer

and helped me when I was sick,
and then he died, that's all.

[eerie music]

[dog barking]

Hey, Mom.

I asked Dominique to go out
with me and guess what she said?

What?
She said yes, just like that.

And boom!

We're gonna go see a movie.

Oh, honey!

I'm so proud of you.

You just needed some
confidence, that's all.

You know, Pflueger was
a godsend, wasn't he?

Yeah.

I wanna give you a big
bear hug right now,

but I don't feel so good.


Hey, can I get you anything?


You know what?
We ran out of aspirin and

I've got a splitting headache.

I'll go get you some.
Would you?

I take the car?

Yeah, sure.

[crickets chirping]

Why are we waiting?

Let's just do this
thing already.

What if we get caught?
Hey, chill.

All right?
She'll be leaving for work soon.

And... and we're sure
Kelly's not home?

Would you put your vagina away?

He's working, dildo.
Don't you ever listen?

[door opens, shuts]
[car engine starts]

Hey.

Mama Trash is on the move.
Oooo, showtime!

Let's do it!
[Nelson] Get in the car, dude.

[train horn blares in distance]


Hey, hey, quiet, quiet.

Shut up!
They've got neighbors.

Come on, come on, come on.

I can't, I can't.
What the fuck?

What the fuck are
you doing, man?

Get the fuck off me.
Are you trying to screw us over? Huh?

I will beat your fuckin' ass.

I don't want to be like you,
so get the hell off me.

Be a bitch then!

[tense rock music]

We're good, let's go.
Come on, let's go!

[music intensifies]

[rattling]
[grunting]

[gas hisses]
[Bernice gasps]



Get the chains, boys.

This shit's stuck.

move your ass!

Let's go, come on!

Fuck you, Kelly!

Farewell, Brad.

[cheering]
We got him, boys.

Mission accomplished.


[gas hissing]


[light bulb breaking]


[explosion booms]

Mom!

Mom!

Mom!

[fire crackling]

Mom, you're gonna be okay.

You're gonna be okay, I got you.

[sobbing]
[dramatic music]

No!


[machine beeping]

[receptionist over PA]
<i>Dr. Howard, ICU.</i>

<i>Dr. Howard, ICU.</i>

[phone ringing]

[beeping continues]

It doesn't make any sense.
Thanks.

How is he, Doc?

We were wrong about
how much damage

the fire did to him.

Most of the charred skin
we found on his body

was actually...

Bernice's.

[indistinct chattering]

Uh, Kelly's ready for release.

Kelly doesn't have
any next of kin.

Can you keep him here
for another night?

I'll make arrangements.

Sure, um...

His mom was a wonderful woman.

Yeah,
she was a beautiful spirit.

Thank you for donating
to her funeral.

Oh, least I could do.

please pick up line nine.</i>

Hey, Kelly.
One more night.

I'll come and
pick you up tomorrow,

and we'll go pay
respects to your mom.

I'll leave these here.

<i>Ya'at'eeh,</i> Sheriff Adler.

Do you remember me?
I am Red Elk.

Yeah!

Man, it's been years since
I've been back to the res.

Kelly has something
that is ours,

given to him by that
scoundrel Pflueger.

I have come to get it back.

Wait, wha... what?

What is that?

[Red Elk] You are Navajo.

You're DinÃ©.

I believe you sense
the medicine in him.

Look. This kid has been
through a lot now.

I don't think he needs to hear

about our folklore passed down

from our
great-great-grandfathers, okay?

When you believe, you find me.

You know where I am.

I need your help to
set things right.

<i>Aho.</i>

<i>Dr. Horowitz, ICU.</i>

pride was her son Kelly,</i>

<i>and we commend her loving
spirit to eternal life.</i>

And now, may you all
go in God's love.

Amen.
[all] Amen.

[somber music]

I'm really sorry about your mom.

She was a very
special person to me.

A second mom when I moved here.

Nobody's gonna think
you're weak if you cry.

[breathing shakily]

I have to be strong.

It's why my mom was
finally proud of me.

She was always proud of you.

[music continues]

Please don't move.

I don't have a choice.

It's not fair making
you leave the town

that you grew up in.

The only thing
I'm gonna miss is you.

Sorry.

Are you kidding?

[ominous whooshing]

Bye.

[soft music]

Goodbye.

[ominous music]

Dom?
Where are you?



[Kelly vomiting]



[demonic growling]

[ominous music]

[voices whispering indistinctly]


Look, Kelly, I know you don't
want to hear this right now,

but I promise you,
I'm gonna find you

the best foster family

so you don't have to be in
social services that long.

Your mom would be so
proud of you right now,

everybody's talking
about you being a hero

for what you did.

Heroes usually save people.

Heroes have the courage
to do what others can't.

Proud of you.

If there's anything you need,

I'll be there, all right?

I'll wait for you.

[birds chirping]

[indistinct radio chatter]

Kelly, did you
have any work done

on your trailer recently?

Like did you move it or

anything that would affect
the supports?

No.
Landscaping?

Any trucks nearby
that would affect it?

No, not that I know of.

Why?

Before the gas ignited,

your trailer fell
off its supports.

Almost like the supports were
pulled out from underneath.

You know how something
like that could happen?

So this wasn't an accident?

[hard rock music playing]

Guys, maybe we tell the cops
that it was a prank.

That... that we thought
the trailer was empty.


So we could spend
the rest of our lives

getting ass-fucked in jail?

Dude, uh, have you had
too many concussions?

Guys, I told you
not to mess with him.

He's a freak.
Shut the fuck up.

Why do I have to sit
next to this guy?

We're not going to the cops

because we had nothing to do

with Mama Trash getting toasted.

Stop calling her that.
[bots laughing]

Mama Trash, Mama Trash.

Okay? It doesn't even matter.

Trash Boy's on his way
out of town already, okay?

So, case closed.
Learn from your big bro.

All right,
I know how to handle shit.

Yeah.
[Reed] If you're sure.

And I mean like, positively...

Fuck yes, we're sure!

All right? Now let's go give
Trash Boy a proper goodbye.

Oh, pucker up bitches,
here we go.


[cheering]
[car horn honking]

So, someone did this?

No, I'm not saying that.
[car horn honking]

Look, it's...
[car horn honking]

[boys laughing]
Hey, bitch!

[boys cheering]
[car horn honking]

[car horn blaring]
[tires screeching]

Yo. Hey, let's hit the river.

River boys, come on!

[Nelson, Tony, and Tucker]
River, river, river!

Those motherfuckers!

Calm down, Kelly.

Bad temper will only
get you into trouble.

Believe me.

[suspenseful music]

Don't pay attention to
those idiots, all right?

Kelly!

Kelly!

Oh, my gosh.
[tense music]

Kelly!

Dispatch.
I need an ATV...

[water rushing]

[ominous music]

[Nelson] Woo, nice!
[Tony] Hard to get off.

It's hot.
Nobody wants to see that.

You probably do.

your body looks like a 12 year old.

[laughing]
[Reed] That's funny.

[Tony and Tucker laughing]

[Tucker] How you feelin'?
I'm all right, I'm all right.

Watch out, there's
some hornets and stuff.

Hornets?
[indistinct chattering]

a bunch of girls?


Lizard city.

All right.


Think I'm gonna hop in.
Oh, a little bath time?

Yeah, bath time, huh.



I'm gonna fuck him up.
You want to fuck him up?

Woo.

[Tony] Boom!
Five bucks you can't hit him.

Chill out, you bitches.
[Nelson] Five bucks.

All right, who's gonna pay?

[tense music]
[indistinct chattering]


Come on.

You gotta... you gotta throw
harder than that.

Hey!
[indistinct chattering]

[Reed] Comin' in hot.
[laughing]



Stop.
[indistinct chattering]


gotta be able to hit him.

[water splashing]
[indistinct chattering]

[demonic whispering]
[Tucker] Yo, Reed, you're a bitch. Hey!

Hey, this is for being
a pussy in trailer town.

[Nelson] Boom!
Hey, watch it.

Guys, stop.
That's for hopping in the car

when Trash Boy came.

[indistinct chattering]

runnin' to, bitch?

[ominous whooshing]

[dramatic music]

[muffled grunting]

[indistinct radio chatter]

[car door slams]

Kelly!

[music continues]

Tucker.

[Kelly choking]

Hey, stop messing around!

Tucker.

Shit.

[water splashing]

[dramatic music]

Yo!

Call the cops, bro.
Yo, come on. Tony!

Tony, help.
[Tony] Put him down, put him down.

Fuck.

Wake up.

Tucker!

Wake up!


wake up, wake up.

Wake up!

Do CPR, dude.
Bro, I don't... I don't know CPR, you do it.

[indistinct chattering]

One bully down.

Three to go.

Who's next?

Shit.

This must be Reed's.

He's spared.

[Adler in distance]
Nelson. Nelson.


Saved by the calvary.

For now.

What just happened?

Trash Boy just fucked
Tucker's shit up.

Don't know how.

But we're gonna kill that freak.

[zipper zips]

One, two... [grunts]

I'm telling you, all right?

Kelly was standing right there.

We... we saw him in the car
with you.

I... I don't know how,
but it's Kelly's fault.

Trash Boy like... drowned him

and then ran up the river.

Yeah, like a fucking coward.

Reed said that you
were throwing rocks.

Did you hit Tucker?

We didn't do this to Tucker.

Did you?

He was our friend,
why would we do that?

You boys are lying
about something.

Just remember that
was your friend

in that body bag.

Having a hard time with this.

I've known Kelly forever
and I just can't believe

that he could hurt anyone.

<i>Well, Tony said he was there</i>

and saw the whole thing.

<i>Have you spoken to Kelly?</i>

[object clatters]
[ominous music]

Hey, I... I gotta go.

<i>Come on, ugh.</i>

[ominous music]

Jesus!

I'm sorry, honey.

Dinner's ready.

I'm skipping dinner.

You must keep this
window closed,

it is not safe.

Especially with Kelly out there.

[dog barking]

Are you sure you're not hungry?
Mom, I can't eat.

Okay, goodnight.

[mysterious music]

Boo!
[gasps]

Not funny.

Sorry.

What happened at
the river with Tucker?

Come with me.

I want to tell you everything.

[ominous music]


You can't go through with this.

Revenge is wrong.

Murdering my mom is wrong.

Kelly, you can't do this.

But I have to.

Then just get them to confess.

That would make your mom proud.

[soft music]

[school bell ringing]

Class, today we are
going to be doing

a very exciting
chemical experiment.

We are going to learn how when

chemicals are left alone
they are stable.

But when they are combined,
they are reactive.

Very reactive.

Ay yo, let's blow
some shit up, yo!


Mr. Miller, enough of
your hi-jinks today.

â™ª Yo, yo, yo, I'm Tony Miller â™ª

â™ª A mad funny rapper â™ª

â™ª And a fuckin' mom killer â™ª

â™ª I play a fool to get
everyone's laughter â™ª

â™ª 'Cause way deep down
I'm just a white boy cracker â™ª

I warned you, Trash Boy.

Don't mess with me or
I'll fucking kill you.

And give me my hat back,
you fuckin' bitch.

Tony! Shut up! Hey, ma...
Give me my hat back!

And Kelly, get out of here!

He's trying to get
you to play his game.

Aw, look who's the pussy
now, Nelson.

Stop!


Okay, I am going to
call the authorities.

[students murmuring]

Tell them.

Tell them what you did!

Stop this and confess!

Milady.

Should you partake in
some of my hilarity?

Should you be so inclined?
[mumbling]

Would you let me stick
you with my teeny-weeny?

[people gasping]
Get the fuck...

No, no, no, Tony.

I got a funny feeling
you're about to hurt yourself.


[Dominique] Stop it!
[Sarah] Tony, don't mess with him.


Tony, don't.

Come on, Tony.
Fuck you!


[demonic whooshing]
[students gasping]


[acid sizzling]

[acid sizzling]
[groaning]

[students groaning]


[girl screams]

Your hat.

[Sarah sobs]

Kelly, why are you doing this?

This was not the plan!


[demonic whooshing]
[groans]

[Dominique gasps] Sarah.

[Sarah sobbing] No!

[tense music]

Tony!

Oh, Nelson doesn't even care
about his own best friend.

You know, he could've
stopped this.

All Nelson cares
about is Nelson!

man.

You did this.
No, no, no, no, no.

Tony made his choice,
but you could've saved him.

And now it's your turn.

Nelson, please just confess.

Come on, what's it
gonna be, Nelson?

What's it gonna be?

Kelly, stop!

Don't move.

Oh, my God.

[students whispering]

Call 911!

[car horn honking]

[dog barking]

Why are you being
so pushy to see me?

It's not safe for me to be
out here with Kelly stalking me.

I... I want to get Kelly back

for what he did to Tony.

So do I.

How? Right, anything
we do to him backfires.

I don't know how to beat him.

I might.

Remember when I told you
what I saw at the funeral?

Trash Boy ate a vine and puked.
So?

Yeah, but it's way
more than that.

[intense music]

Is this a part of the cemetery?


[Nelson] Shit.
Oh!

What?
Kelly's vomit.

[Nelson] Sick.
[Sarah] Jesus.

It's right here.

What, this weed?



Uh, is that gonna get
on my seat?

Really?
You care about your damn seats?

[ominous music]

Come on, let's go.

[ominous music]

Oh, Jesus. Nelson?

Nelson?
There you are.

Get this science experiment
shit out of here, it stinks.

Yeah, yeah, I'll get to it, Dad.

Thank you. Oh, and you're
going to the field tomorrow,

so don't make plans.

School's closed.

Not for you, it ain't.

Tell your brother too, will you?

I can't seem to
motivate that kid.

Hey, Reed!
There you are.

You're going tomorrow.

I didn't raise no pussies.

I-I have a concussion, Dad.

I'll probably get a CTE.

CTE, really?

You don't even know what
the hell that shit is.

You're going.

[ominous music]

[dramatic music]

[vines ripping]

[engine rumbling]

Let's go. Wind sprints.

Hustle, come on!

Gus, I can't protect
them out here.

Relax, God.

Listen to me.

You don't know what
you're dealing with.

Yeah, I do.

He's a mealy-mouth
little punk-ass kid

who for some reason
scares the shit outta you.

You worry too much.

Come on, boys!

[birds chirping]

[whistle blows]

That's it. That's it!

There it is,
good hands, good hands.

All right, bring it back,
bring it back.

Nelson, you're gonna go long.

And Reed, remember,
you got a safety deep.

So go for the ball,
trust your safety.

Come on, let's go.

You know we're gonna stay
here until you get it right.

All right, let's try it again.

You ready? Do it right
this time, same play.

Come on.
[continues indistinctly]

[tense music]

You want to be here all day?

I don't, it's hotter than hell.

SO move your ass so we
can get done and get home.

All right, his ball, go long.

Line it up.

Line it up.

Same play, same play.

Let's go, let's go.

[Gus continues indistinctly]

[music continues]

Let's go, give me the ball.

Remember...
Gus.

I need to talk to your boys.

About what?

Don't worry about it.

[drill whirring]

come here.

What's going on?

Nelson, I found the chains

in the back of your
dad's pickup truck.

I put them in there last night.

Why?

you want to tell me?

Nah. I don't know what
you're talking about, Sheriff.

What about you, Reed?

I had nothing to
do with nothing.

Well, there you go.

Glad we cleared that up.

Thanks for coming by.


It's the walking
garbage disposal.

[dramatic music]

So fucking gross.

But it'll be worth it.

[drill whirs]
Now who's ready?

Look, Kelly, I had nothing to do
with your mother's death, I swear.

Reed, where the hell
are you going?

Reed, get back here!

I like Reed.
Never thought I'd say that.

Hey, I'm ready, Trash Boy.

[tense music]

Kelly, don't listen to him.

I can help you.

I won't ask again!

What are you waiting for, bud?
Arrest his ass.

[music continues]

[drill whirring]
[groaning]

[Nelson screaming]

Drop that drill, Kelly.

Not until he confesses!

You know what you did!

Nelson, you stubborn bastard!


[screaming]
Fuck is this?

Boys will be boys.

[Nelson groaning]

Fuck this!

Come on, shoot him, God damn it!

I can handle this!

Kelly!

I know Nelson was involved.

I found the chain
he used on your trailer,

but you have to stop this.

This is not you.

I know Pflueger gave you
those powers.

What do you know about that?

they're not yours.

They haven't been used
for a hundred years.

That medicine is very dangerous.

This is fuckin' bullshit, man!
[Nelson screaming]

Look what he's doing to my son!

Kelly, stop!


Fuck this!


You okay?




Take that, you son
of a dead bitch!


What the hell is he?

Shoot him now, he's weak!

Back up, bud. I don't want
to hurt you. Get away.

Don't do...
Get the fuck away.

[demonic whooshing]

This ends now.

Nelson killed my mom.

He and Tony burned
her alive in our home.

What is wrong with you?

What's wrong with all of you?

Goodbye, freak.
Don't shoot!

[gun fires]

[dark demonic screeching]


Man, that itches.
Kelly, look what you've done!

What... look what I've done?

This was their doing.

They're dead because of you!

No, I didn't kill anyone,
Gus chose to pull that trigger.

So this is what your mom
would've wanted?

Would she be proud of you?

You know, I really
liked the old Kelly,

not this new Kelly.

I want you... to like me.

It's all I've ever wanted.

I don't like you, Kelly.
Not anymore.

[somber music]
[breathing shakily]


we can help you bring back
the old Kelly.

I don't want to
be the old Kelly.

Weak and... and powerless,
the one everyone shits on!

You can't have me
and have the powers!

No, that's not fair!

How do you expect
me to give this up?

I can control it, I promise.


No one can.

Kelly, if you ever cared for me,

give these powers
back to Red Elk.

Cared for you?

I love you.

[tense music]


Drop the gun.

That won't solve anything.
[sniffles]


[music continues]


[dramatic music]
[Red Elk chanting]

[thunder rumbles]

[music continues]

[thunder rumbles]

Kelly. Kelly, listen to me.

Red Elk is gonna make
you my Kelly again, okay?

Okay? And then we're gonna make
you stronger than ever together,

I promise.

[soft demonic screeching]

[thunder rumbles]
You owe me a movie.

Yeah.

Yeah, I do.

[thunder cracks]
[chanting]

That one's our killer, right?

I don't know why he hasn't
called for backup.

Well, I got my
backup right here.

Let's go.
[gun cocks]

I don't know.

[tense music]


[thunder cracks]

Is it working?

Hurry!

What the hell?

let it go, let it go!

Don't stop!
Soon it will be free!

[thunder cracks]

[Red Elk] Let it go!

What's happening?
[groaning]

Keep going!

[thunder cracks]
What's happening to him?

You said he'd be okay!

Stop it, stop it!

You're killing him!


Listen to me, Kelly. Kelly, when I
scream, you run as fast as you can.

Okay?

Stop it!

He's had it too long!

You said we could save him.

[Red Elk] It's a part of him.

He must die.

Then I will have the power.

I will not kill this boy.

We must bury him with Pflueger.

I can save him.

[intense music]



[Adler] Wait, wait!
[gun firing]

[Dominique and Kelly groaning]

[thunder cracks]

[thunder rumbling]

No. No, no, no.

No, no, Dominique, no, no, no.

Stay with me. Please stay.

[Dominique whimpering]

I'm sorry I made you come here.

It's okay, I...

I would do anything for you.

[somber music]

[soft demonic screeching]

Then don't give them the power.

I won't.

I love you.

I always will.

I love...

No.

No, no...

No!

[thunder rumbles]

No one will ever have
this power again!

Why did you do this to me?

Why!

This evil dies with me.

With me, Pflueger!

[ominous music]


[dark demonic roaring]




[thunder rumbles]


Do you have it?

No.

this town is crazy, man.

Yeah, Carter, I know bro.

Hey, can you turn this up?

[Carter] Got it.
Aight.

[techno music playing]

[demonic whooshing]
[Dominique gasping]


[dramatic music]

Man, that itches.

[chuckling]
[Carter] You good back there?

Uh... no.
