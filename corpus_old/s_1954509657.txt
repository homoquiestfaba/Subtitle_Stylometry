1 
It's her smile I miss the most. 

2 
It's my own fault things 
headed this way, really

3 
Why? 

4 
Most people have no idea 
what kinds of things, monsters really exist. 

5 
It creeps me out. 

6 
Evil is out there and I'm gonna find it
and I'll put it where it belongs 
even if I have to do it alone. 

7 


8 
The Devil's gonna pay. 

9 
I know what I'm doing. 

10 
I think. 

11 
Oh! 

12 
These terrorists actually think
they are gonne get away with it. 

13 
We all know that evil doesn't really exist. 

14 
Allah Akbar. 

15 
It's him, it's him!
Come, boys look! 

16 


17 
I have just received a revelation from 
Allah, the most merciful. 

18 
No more warnings. 

19 
These pigs and dogs 
ignore them anyway 

20 
And they are unworthy of
escaping Allah's mighty wrath.. 

21 
Prepare therefore to enter paradise.

22 
Allah Akbar. 
Praise be to Allah. 

23 
Allah Akbar. 
Allah Akbar. 

24 
Tell my mother not to weep ... 

25 
for I will be in paradise. 

26 
Turn your sorrow into anger. 

27 
For I got to give my life in Jihad. 
By Allah. 

28 
Only use it once. Don't forget. 
Don't worry about me man. 

29 
If we have any reason to worry.

30 
If ever betray our trust...

31 
I don't have to tell you what
we're gonna do to you, huh?

32 
Yo man, I passed all your tests
so far ain't I?

33 
I'm good bro. 

34 
Pass this last test you'll
get everything you want

35 
All we've got is a face. 

36 
That's the best we can do. 

37 
It's just the tip of an iceberg. 
He's working with someone new. 

38 
Someone of major concern. 

39 
Your mission is to track him down
and take him out 

40 
and everyone who's working with him

41 
As usual, no evidence, no witnesses.

42 
<i> Find out what you can and then 
kill them all. </ i> 

43 
If you fail in any way, 
we will deny any involvement, 

44 
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. 

45 
I just want to know that you're 
the only one we can count on to
get the job done right.

46 


47 
Just you. 

48 
Where is it? 

49 
Great Satan! 

50 
Doing your mother proud my man. 

51 
Balls of steal, thanks for the message.

52 
I'm gonna get 'em this time. 

53 
What is the scene up there anyway? 

54 
You don't wanna go up there man. 
 

55 
Bite me! 

56 
In your dreams scumbag. 
I know what you are. 

57 
Your dead powers belong to us! 

58 
Your breath is already wicked enough. 
You're making me dizzy. 

59 
Now, shut up! 

60 
Rinse! 

61 
Here's your problem. 

62 
That's a little better. 

63 
Now ... 

64 
you must give me bite! 

65 
For the glory of Allah, bite me! 

66 
OK! suit yourself. 
You ready? 

67 
Bloodbath. 

68 
Oh, yeah. 

69 
You again. 

70 
Well, it looks like you
caught me red-handed this time. 

71 
Don't move. 

72 
Don't move! 

73 
Do you mind? 
These guys bleed too much. 

74 
<i> I'm serious. </ i> 

75 
This is the last time. 

76 
Okay <i>-</ i> 

77 
What is that? 
Silver. 

78 
Ouch! 
Isn't that for werewolves? 

79 
That stings. 

80 
Never been shot by a
silver bullet before. 

81 
I got a clip full of them. 

82 
Yeah? If you shoot me again, 
you're really gonna piss me off. 

83 
That's it. 

84 
Let me guess. 
Holy water? 

85 
Please. You'll get more reaction 
from sewer water. 

86 
Come on, get up. 

87 
Is that all you got for me tonight?

88 
Weak. 

89 
Looks like you've been doing 
your homework, 

90 
but you're reading the wrong books. 

91 
Hey, look. 

92 
Improvise. 

93 
Grab the knives and throw them at me

94 
Nice shot. 

95 
Not the face! 

96 
My turn. 

97 
You know what happens when you kill a cop? 


98 
I'm gonna kill a couple more? 

99 
I wanna kill you so bad. 

100 
I was just gonna say 
the same thing to you. 

101 
So what's your excuse, huh? 

102 
I ain't the one who is immortal here. 
I'm healing. 

103 
Just wait. 

104 
Yeah, well, I'm just resting so, 
if you wanna go get it ... 

105 
Now you're just getting lucky. 

106 
You are persistent though. 
I'm coming after you no matter what. 

107 
You're out there killing people 
all the time that's just ... 

108 
That's just messed up. 

109 
I'm a hit man what do you expect
me to do, get a day job?

110 
Besides these guys are all pigshit anyway.

111 
I'm just cleaning it up
before you step in it 

112 
I'm doing you a favor. 
Well here. 

113 
Drive this stake in your heart and 
do me another one. 

114 
Sorry pal, you're just 
gonna have to keep trying. 

115 
Tell me, besides trying to kill me, 

116 
Why are you so by the book? 
Innocent until proven guilty. 

117 
I should be arresting these guys 
not letting you kill them. 

118 
What about me? 

119 
You've never seen me kill anyone. 
You're guilty. 

120 
Look at yourself. Look at what you are 
you're not even human. 

121 
You deserve to burn in hell. 

122 
That may be true. 

123 
But if you'll only knew what these filthy 
cockroaches were planning on doing ... 

124 
The system can handle guys like this. 
Your system is a game. 

125 
These guys are guilty. 
Trust me on that one. 

126 
My solution was just a whole lot 
faster and cheaper then yours. 

127 
And it's still justice. 

128 
Who gives you the right to be 
judge and jury, huh? 

129 
You can't possibly know everything. 

130 
I'll tell you what I do know. 

131 
Terrorists are invading the city. 
They're about to do something big. 

132 
I may be evil but they're way worse. 
Then I'll arrest them. 

133 
No you won't. 

134 
Gotta go. 

135 
By the way ... 
in 10 seconds get out of here. 

136 
The building's gonna blow. 

137 
Did I forget to mention that? 

138 
What can you tell us about 
what happened here today? 

139 
Well, you see this building here... 
it just blew up

140 
It's on fire now. 

141 
It's probably very hot. 

142 
Did you hear the thunder last night? 
Crazy! 

143 
Ho, ho, ho, man. 
Hold another all-nighter, huh? 

144 
Just doing my job 

145 
Your job? 
What the hell is this? 

146 
As I was telling him, my job. 

147 
I got the feds, CIA, NSA, 

148 
and the department of homeland security 
all over my ass all because of you. 

149 
You know ... 

150 
I like my coffee like 
I like my women. 

151 
Don't you dare say it! 

152 
In my office now! 

153 
Brown and bitter. 

154 
I want an explanation. 

155 
Tell me what you've left out the report. 

156 
Everything I know is in there. 

157 
I promise. 
Really? 

158 
Single suspect, none forced entry. 

159 
Out of hundreds of shots fired, 
not one drop of his blood was found. 

160 
Nor was there so much a trace 
of evidence he was even there. 

161 
I doubt this man even exists. 

162 
I don't know what you want me to tell you. 
It's in the report. 

163 

164 
Mr. President, we caught one. 
He's getting us partial intel on a meeting 

165 
between high-level terrorist 
gathering in Manyak Akbar village. 

166 
The missing Sovjet weapons expert 
apparently, he's there too. 

167 
Let me guess. 

168 
He won't give us the time, this gathering 

169 
untill I have to get to New York 
to see his lawyer. 

170 
Permission to continue enhanced 
interrogation technique Sir? 

171 
Damn right! 

172 
Welcome my brother. 

173 
I am Zubri. 

174 
I trust your journey
was pleasant one? 

175 
Please come with me. 
Let me show you to you quarters. 

176 
You're going to love it. 

177 
What's with the fetus? 

178 
This is Marud. 
He's our explosives expert. 

179 
But ... 
There is no one better. 

180 
Please ... our servants will 
show you to your room. 

181 
We will summon you for the meeting. 

182 
Master! 

183 
Master, they have returned! 
They have returned! 

184 
They have returned! 

185 
Brother, they are back! 

186 
Where are the others? 

187 
I'm the only one left. 
Yes, you've done well. 

188 
I ... I have completed my quest. 

189 
Indeed. Get him the man a drink. 

190 
Please. 

191 
Bring the chest to my chambers,
and prepare a toast! 

192 
In celebration of our unity, 
we drink to Jihad. 

193 
The life is in the blood. 

194 
This is our Jihad bomb. 

195 
It will blow up an entire city. 

196 
All we need is nuclear material 
to be inserted here 

197 
and for detonation device, 
which will go there. 

198 
Now, a normal nuclear bomb 
would take out this area. 

199 
And it will fall out... and spread here. 

200 
But the new experimental material you 
will obtain will cause such immense damage. 

201 
we can only calculate it. 

202 
No one has ever seen the effects. 

203 
But ... it should do this. 

204 
What would we do without the Russians? 

205 
Excuse me. 

206 
But, where are we going to get 
such nuclear material? 

207 
Leave that to me. 

208 
What we worry about is getting us all
into enemy lands without being detected. 

209 
We have researched all potential ways 
of infiltrating the United States. 

210 
We have found the absolute safest, 
easiest way possible 

211 
without the slightest
possibility of being caught. 

212 
I have obtained student visas 
for all of us. 

213 
Something called racial profiling 
and political correctness, 

214 
which basically means there is not
a change we will be searched 

215 
as long as we all look 
exactly like terrorists. 

216 
I'll handle it. 

217 
Everyone get out. 

218 
But ... 

219 
Get out! 

220 
Yes sir. 

221 
Find them ... 
wherever they are hiding. 

222 
And, um ... 
I want him to redecorate. 

223 
Absolutely. 

224 
Any particular method? 

225 
Something with flair. 
Done. 

226 
Do the worst... 

227 
whatever it takes. 
I don't want to know. 

228 
No problem. Will do. 

229 
Yes, thank you Mr. President. 

230 
Security missed it. 

231 
It showed up on our facial recognition 
system a few hours ago.. 

232 
His name is ... 
Muhammad Akeem bin Fatah. 

233 
Kalamhi Ahkbah Sallam Fatanm. 

234 
Falla Abdulla Hasan Yassan Kwani. 

235 
Ah, screw it. 
Let's just call him Bob. 

236 
We don't exactly know 
what he is up to. 

237 
He always seems to be 
two steps ahead of us. 

238 
But he has taken out some of 
some of the world's top agents. 

239 
What do you suspect? 

240 
We can't even begin to imagine,
but whatever it is,

241 
it'll be catastrophic. 

242 
That's why we ned you to stop him. 

243 
This is one of his latest atrocities. 

244 
His men filtered with children
carrying explosives. 

245 
This man is really pure evil. 
He's a reprobate. 

246 
He needs to be dead. 
Leads? 

247 
Get this he's just a narc.. 

248 
He was in there looking for drug dealers 
and stumbles on to a terrorist cell. 

249 
He's answering directly to the NSA now. 

250 
He's in way over his head. 

251 
Is that cop still on your tail? 
Not for long. 

252 
Do you want us to take care of it? 
No. I'll handle it. 

253 
You keep saying that. 
Why don't you just take him out? 

254 
We have the authority. 

255 
Take a look at this.
This is worse then we thought. 

256 
They call him "The executioner". 

257 
He loves decapitation. 

258 
Chances are he is the man in the hood 
in most beheading videos out there. 

259 
He's the most dangerous explosives man
in the world and probably the best. 

260 
His name is Marud. 

261 
Don't let his size fool you

262 
Ali, he loves chemical biological weaponry. 

263 
He invents new drugs for the enemy. 

264 
One more rear way for Jihad. 

265 
According to our informative, key players 
have moved to an undisclosed location 

266 
We can't just let that lie. 

267 
We've got to take on that warehouse. 

268 
 

269 
Run those cockroaches out 
and see what happens. 

270 
Now ... if you want to start 
digging for Bob ... 

271 
Errand boy, 
he looks like a jackass. 

272 
Put some pressure on him. 
He'll leak something. 

273 
Sounds like fun. 

274 
Don't take these guys lightly. 

275 
They train hard. 

276 
They're ready for anything, 
maybe even for you. 

277 
You might may want to have a plan this time. 

278 
You wanna know what my plan is? 

279 
They're all going back to 
the desert in body bags. 

280 
Where Allah won't even be able to use 
dental records to recognize them. 

281 
Yeah. 

282 
Are you gonna get in 'em,
or do I have to make ya? 

283 
I thought we talked about this. 

284 
You're right, here it is. 

285 
It's still half my house too, right? 

286 
You'll get your half. 

287 
Come on you really wanna sell? 
 

288 
Do you really want to do this? 

289 
Look at you! 

290 
Look at your face! 

291 
Vampires again? 

292 
I can't handle seeing you like this. 

293 
It's not fair to me. 
I'm chasing bad guys baby. 

294 
Look, I'm trying to make a difference. 

295 
Can't we just give it another shot? 

296 
I mean we love each other. 

297 
You can quit your job. 

298 
Don't ask me to do that. 
You can start over. 

299 
We can start over. 

300 
I ... 

301 
I'm sorry. 

302 
I gotta go. 

303 
I told you, get in the body bags! 

304 
Help me! 
What is wrong? 

305 
The great Satan, 
the man with the dream powers ... 

306 
Yes? 

307 
He's here. 

308 
A Jew! 

309 
Where's your boss? 

310 
I cannot tell you. 
I can start carving. 

311 
Pain is only temporary compared to 
what will happen to me if I talk. 

312 
Uh, we've been instructed to ask you,
to uh, bite us ...

313 
if we ever ran into you and well... 

314 
So ... bite me. 

315 
Why do you guys always think 
I'm gonna turn you? 

316 
So you can blow yourselfs up
over and over again? 

317 
Please? 

318 
I can't believe you just did that. 
Yeah? 

319 
Does it hurt? 

320 
No. 

321 
A punch of the skin? 

322 
What's wrong with you? 

323 
What am I supposed to shoot you with? 

324 
Well now you got to put up with the 
smell of garlic while I kick your ass. 

325 
Come one get up. 

326 
We done? 
Yeah yeah ... 

327 
ended. 

328 
You know, after I rest a little, 

329 
Im gonna knock you in the walls and stuff. 

330 
You're probably gonna lose that arm. 

331 
I'm not giving up. 

332 
Yeah, I figured. 
How do you look at yourself in the mirror? 

333 
You want to know how it works right? 

334 
Demons. 
Thousands of demons. 

335 
They posses me, to be made to this. 
Even one demon is pretty damn evil. 

336 
Yeah, you think? 

337 
They don't get to call the shots, I do. 

338 
How much will power does that take? 

339 
You know exactly how much it takes. 

340 
So if you they changed you this much why 
Think of it this way 

341 
Everyone has a dark side. 

342 
You were a cross so you understand 
that it's sin, so just call it evil. 

343 
For me it's a little more literal, 
sure but it's ... 

344 
It's all how you acknowledge it 
and don't let it control you. 

345 
So if you're so good, how can   
be killed looking at a cross? 

346 
Some sort of biochemical reaction that...

347 
No gee, I don't know. I think I just 
told you something about demons? 

348 
They just can't take it. 

349 
They're the problem, not me. 

350 
Yes but they give you all that strength. 

351 
Yeah. And I'm not gonna let it go to waste

352 
If I can make 'em all my bitch, 
I'll use this power for truth, 

353 
<i> justice and the American way. </ i> 

354 
You're a demon possessed vampire. 

355 
It's my duty to take you out. 
Ill tell you what. 

356 
You stop sinning, I'll let
you take me out. How's that? 

357 
Bite me. 

358 
Is that a sin or a request? 

359 
Don't bite me! 

360 
Psst, Rip, come here. 

361 
You okay? 

362 
You're gonna blow this thing. 
You need to lay off man. 

363 
Allright listen to me 
we can handle this. 

364 
Look, I'm not on this right? 

365 
I'm working something else. 

366 
Obviously you need help with it, 
whatever it is. 

367 
Hey, Rip, you need a hospital. 

368 
I just want you to know that 
I wasn't stepping on your toes. 

369 
Stay safe, allright? 

370 
They're all dead. 

371 
Who did it? What did you see? 

372 
I asked him to bite me. 

373 
Something is coming. 

374 
He's coming for us all. 

375 
No more failure! 
It will not be tolerated! 

376 
Give him ten lashes. 
That should cure him of his fears. 

377 
Thank you! Thank you master! 
Whatever it is, we are ready for it. 

378 
Oh, you really cut it close tonight. 

379 
Don't tell me it was that cop again.

380 
You're too valuable to let a guy
like that keep you out all night. 

381 
We both know what can happen. 
Don't worry about me. 

382 
I had time to kill. 

383 
Why don't you think about 
killing more then time 

384 
the next time you see him again? 

385 
Now, we picked up some shatter and confirmed, 

386 
You really screwed up tonight. 

387 
You were seen by a Zubri. 

388 
How bad? 

389 
This could turn out really serious. 

390 
Maybe they'll be ready for you this time. 

391 
Hey eh, can I talk to you for a minute? 

392 
About what? 

393 
I think I found some evidence
and it doesn't add up.

394 
I wanted to ask you about it. 

395 
Like? 

396 
Vampires. 

397 
What? Come on, go screw yourself. 
No, I'm serious! 

398 
I eh, I believe it, I think 
I can help you prove it. 

399 
Allright. 
So, uh, tell me about this vampire. 

400 
What do you wanna know? 
Who is he? What does he do? 

401 
You can see what he does. 

402 
He's a sadistic killer. 

403 
You've read all the reports right? 
It's all in there. 

404 
Alone? 
Are you screwing with me? 

405 
How does he do all that? 
Intense right?

406 
What, does he dodge bullets? 
No, no, he doesn't have to. 

407 
It's not his style. 
He'd rather just take it and keep smiling. 

408 
So what happens? 

409 
He just heals right back up. 

410 
Yeah, oh, one more thing. 

411 
He's huge and he's strong.

412 
I mean this guy can throw a guy farther 
then you and I can trust him that's for sure. 

413 
Yeah! What else can he do? 

414 
When he gets angry,
and he has enough energy, 

415 
He can actually hear his heartbeat grow
louder and louder before every kill

416 
Oh, and this is the strangest part. 

417 
He messes with electronic equipment
and it's like...

418 
radio frequencies and television receptions
and stuff, I mean.

419 
No kidding, so can he fly? 
Yeah. I asked him that one time. 

420 
He explained to me that it takes too
much energy to fly all the time. 
 

421 
I mean do you run as fast as you can
everywhere all of the time?

422 
No, it makes sense 

423 
So what else? Garlic? 

424 
No. Only annoys him. 

425 
Silver Bullets?

426 
I tried them, they don't work. 
Does he bite? 

427 
No, of course not. 
He will not bite anyone. 

428 
Apparently he's the last vampire. 
He's not gonna turn anyone else either. 

429 
He's not gonna turn anyone else!

430 
You're a killer Van Helsing, Rip. 

431 
Son of ... 
I've come to suck your blood. 

432 
Enough! 

433 
In my office now! 

434 
The rest of you get back to work! 

435 
Do you want to tell me what that was all about? 

436 
Fine! Do you want to tell 
what this is all about? 

437 
I told you it's all in there. 

438 
Yeah, well, except for the little part
you left out about monsters.

439 
Internal affairs wants a psych test.

440 
That's great. 

441 
Whatever they say goes. 
If you pass you'll get 30 days probation. 

442 
If you fail ... 

443 
sorry it's out of my hands.

444 
No one puts in the hours I put in. 

445 
I'm dedicated to my work 
and you know it. 

446 
Well then convince them. 

447 
Talk about vampires 
and see what they have to say. 

448 
It's simple ... I mean, come one

449 
Allright, we were just messing around
we joke around like this all the time.

450 
When was the last time you get some rest? 

451 
A while. 

452 
<i> Go home, get some sleep. </ i> 

453 
I'll push back your evaluation 
until this evening. 

454 
If I had a home. 

455 
Excuse me I mean no disrespect but,

456 
once we complete the tunnel, 
how will we get through that? 

457 
It would take us a year, 
and no man could survive going inside. 

458 
Do not worry brother. 

459 
Allah will provide. 

460 
Soon we will eclipse the 
Manhattan raid so much,

461 
The world will never even remember it. 

462 
 

463 
New intel.
We're hearing about some sort of genie. 

464 
A goat demon of some sort.

465 
Yeah right. 

466 
I wouldn't take this lightly if were you. 

467 
Yeah? Why not? 

468 
I eat Gen for breakfast. 
They are saying it's a Merin, 

469 
The most dangerous of the Gen 

470 
This is not a fairy tale. 

471 
Are you serious? 

472 
You expect me to believe this? 

473 
You're real aren't you? 

474 
Listen, I've been doing some thinking, 

475 
and I might gonna have to quit. 

476 
I might get fired. 

477 
They can't trust you either? 

478 
Yeah they eh, they think I'm crazy too. 

479 
Well there's something wrong with you. 

480 
Look I just want to know if there's 
a chance for us if I do. 

481 
What do you want me to say Rip? 

482 
Yes. 

483 
Not when you look like a train wreck! 
What do you want me to do? 

484 
What do you want me to do? 
Do you want me to show you the vampire! 

485 
Do you honestly think 
that's what I want? 

486 
I'm sorry. 

487 
I gotta go. 

488 
I'm sorry. 

489 
Damn vampire. 


00:41:18, 209 --> 00: 41:20, 211
First my wife and now my job.

00:41:47, 438 --> 00: 41:48, 974
Who is the raisin head?

00:41:52, 343 --> 00: 41:55, 153
He's our new dealer.
He has been checked out.

00:41:56, 647 --> 00: 41:58, 718
I have the status update you requested.

00:41:59, 216 --> 00: 42:02, 891
The project will be completed
and ready by friday night.

00:42:03, 587 --> 00: 42:05, 760
Excellent, excellent.

00:42:24, 475--> 00: 42:26, 546
Our informant's tracking device is down.

00:42:27, 578--> 00: 42:28, 113
We know why.

00:42:29, 680--> 00: 42:32, 160
-He must be in some kind of fortified
-underground layer?

00:42:32, 483--> 00: 42:33, 393
Yeah.

00:42:33, 984--> 00: 42:36, 965
We're getting all kinds of 
seismic readings from this area

00:42:38, 389--> 00: 42:40, 926
How safe do you feel on the
streets of your city

00:42:41, 325--> 00: 42:43, 737
knowing that the very officials
payed to protect you

00:42:43, 961--> 00: 42:46, 168
Are using their power to harm you?

00:42:46, 397--> 00: 42:48, 138
In tonights edition I will
show you evidence,

00:42:48, 365--> 00: 42:50, 242
of rampant government corruption.

00:42:50, 434--> 00: 42:53, 210
Public servants infecting our city
and our nation

00:42:53, 637--> 00: 42:56, 846
A peace officer purposely detonates
a crime scene.

00:42:57, 041--> 00: 42:59, 612
We learned that this same 
peace officer was also involved

00:42:59, 877--> 00: 43:01, 914
in the recent warehouse massacre.

00:43:02, 179--> 00: 43:04, 887
where were 58 innocent people
were found slayen.

00:43:06, 884--> 00: 43:07, 589
I got it.

00:43:07, 785--> 00: 43:09, 924
Why are we not allowed to
reveal his identity?

00:43:10, 588--> 00: 43:14, 365
Government regulations restricting
the very freedom of this broadcast.

00:43:15, 726--> 00: 43:19, 139
This footage was captured mere
minutes after the incident.

00:43:19, 630--> 00: 43:21, 974
What kind of back alley deal was this?

00:43:23, 267--> 00: 43:25, 577
Here is why you should be concerned.

00:43:28, 038--> 00: 43:35, 718
Allah Akbar.

00:43:38, 048--> 00: 43:45, 694
Allah Akbar.

00:43:46, 123--> 00: 43:49, 002
-Allah Akbar.
-This is my favorite part.

00:43:55, 366--> 00: 43:57, 039
This will be recorded.

00:44:01, 705--> 00: 44:06, 552
Case number 1156743,
Rip Lancaster.

00:44:06, 877--> 00: 44:10, 848
Questioning will encompass all
case work for the past 18 months.

00:44:11, 181--> 00: 44:12, 558
State your name please.

00:44:17, 221--> 00: 44:19, 132
Thank you for meeting with us.

00:44:20, 758--> 00: 44:22, 032
Let's talk business.

00:44:22, 393--> 00: 44:23, 371
Let's.

00:44:23, 794--> 00: 44:25, 637
We would like you to give us details

00:44:25, 896--> 00: 44:28, 376
on the police officer you 
profiled on your show.

00:44:28, 832--> 00: 44:31, 870
His name, where he works, 
where he lives.

00:44:32, 436--> 00: 44:33, 779
What's in it for me?

00:44:36, 340--> 00: 44:38, 877
This, $2 million.

00:44:39, 209--> 00: 44:42, 622
And we will also give you 
the story of your career.

00:44:43, 480--> 00: 44:45, 892
We'll even tell you where to park your van.

00:44:48, 552--> 00: 44:50, 361
Let's get right to the heart of it.

00:44:51, 188--> 00: 44:53, 361
Do you believe in vampires?

00:44:53, 557--> 00: 44:58, 199
Yeah, I mean, no.
Look, it's just a hobby.

00:44:58, 462--> 00: 44:59, 998
You mean hunting vampires?

00:45:00, 097--> 00: 45:03, 476
Not, of course not.
Look, I just read about them.

00:45:03, 667--> 00: 45:05, 340
You know? Thats all.

00:45:19, 049--> 00: 45:19, 754
Oh, no.

00:45:20, 384--> 00: 45:22, 921
Allah Akbar.

00:45:23, 721--> 00: 45:25, 325
This is my favorite part.

00:45:26, 190--> 00: 45:30, 138
Allah Akbar.
Allah Akbar.

00:45:31, 929--> 00: 45:32, 805
Here.

00:45:34, 832--> 00: 45:36, 937
They've already isolated the back room.

00:45:38, 302--> 00: 45:39, 474
Massive digging.

00:45:39, 937--> 00: 45:41, 917
That confirms the seismic readings.

00:45:43, 307--> 00: 45:45, 844
They'll have their location 
pinpointed any second.

00:45:56, 553--> 00: 45:57, 588
I'm sorry, Rip.

00:46:00, 758--> 00: 46:01, 634
Yeah.

00:46:13, 537--> 00: 46:14, 914
You gonna be okay?

00:46:27, 785--> 00: 46:30, 356
I least know who to call if
I ever run into a vampire.

00:46:33, 624--> 00: 46:34, 500
Thanks.

00:46:36, 026--> 00: 46:37, 369
I don't believe in vampires.

00:47:37, 688--> 00: 47:39, 690
We have to take out Bob, ASAP.

00:47:40, 390--> 00: 47:42, 893
-They're about to go nuclear.
-I won't let that happen.

00:47:44, 394--> 00: 47:45, 737
Now remember,

00:47:46, 230--> 00: 47:50, 576
This genie is unlike any enemy
you've ever fought before.

00:47:51, 702--> 00: 47:54, 080
I'm not sure you're aware
of the dangers it may pose.

00:47:54, 438--> 00: 47:55, 781
From what I read in the file,

00:47:55, 939--> 00: 47:58, 852
I'm assuming that I can take it out
with extra fire power save enough.

00:47:59, 209--> 00: 48:00, 950
You'll get all the fire power you want.

00:48:05, 315--> 00: 48:09, 161
Your primary objective
is an executive order.

00:48:21, 598--> 00: 48:23, 635
You can do whatever is deemed necessary

00:48:23, 967--> 00: 48:28, 416
to rid the world of this blue eyed 
....... sack of feces.

00:48:48, 792--> 00: 48:49, 793
It's him.

00:48:51, 628--> 00: 48:53, 005
Do they have my wife?

00:48:53, 630--> 00: 48:55, 735
Yeah, they got your girl.

00:49:02, 239--> 00: 49:03, 684
He's on his way.

00:49:18, 322--> 00: 49:19, 266
Show me.

00:49:35, 405--> 00: 49:36, 679
What the?

00:49:41, 545--> 00: 49:43, 525
You just killed the guy 
that knows where my wife is!

00:49:43, 914--> 00: 49:47, 726
I just did you a big favor.
He was leading you into a trap.

00:50:07, 137--> 00: 50:08, 912
Now it's your turn to do me a favor.

00:50:09, 206--> 00: 50:12, 187
Ah yeah? What do I get out of it?
Are you gonna help me find my wife?

00:50:12, 509--> 00: 50:16, 548
I'll let you live.

00:50:21, 018--> 00: 50:23, 328
So you still haven't figured
out which side your on?

00:50:23, 553--> 00: 50:25, 362
I'm on yours that's for damn sure..

00:50:27, 824--> 00: 50:29, 804
You know there's only two 
things you need from me

00:50:30, 527--> 00: 50:32, 029
a cross and a wooden stake.

00:50:32, 729--> 00: 50:36, 267
-Yeah get back all that extra stuff.
-It makes me feel comfortable.

00:50:39, 036--> 00: 50:40, 515
Does that feel comfortable?

00:51:20, 510--> 00: 51:22, 547
-So what do you want from me?
-Instead of getting in my way,

00:51:23, 346--> 00: 51:25, 519
why don't you help me this time, deal?

00:51:26, 283--> 00: 51:28, 511
Not quite. These guys got my wife
I want you to help me.

00:51:27, 524--> 00: 51:28, 763


00:51:29, 152--> 00: 51:31, 723
-No, you help me.
-No, you'll help me!

00:51:35, 425--> 00: 51:36, 233
Don't move!

00:51:46, 203--> 00: 51:48, 114
I notice you have been
taken credit for my work

00:51:48, 872--> 00: 51:51, 478
-How's that working out for your career?
-We'll talk about that later.

00:51:52, 142--> 00: 51:54, 884
-You know I had nothing to do with it.
-Yeah right.

00:52:03, 286--> 00: 52:07, 428
-I know you're obsessed.
-You're full of it, that's a bunch of bull.

00:52:07, 791--> 00: 52:09, 896
You see the last guy that came 
after me this hard,

00:52:10, 660--> 00: 52:12, 503
He ended up in a mental institution.

00:52:13, 597--> 00: 52:14, 735
You're doing much better.

00:52:15, 098--> 00: 52:17, 738
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna help you
until you agree to help me first.

00:52:21, 905--> 00: 52:23, 851
Looks like you're doing a pretty good job.

00:52:26, 977--> 00: 52:28, 012
I know.

00:52:35, 085--> 00: 52:36, 860
Still think you should be arresting these guys?

00:52:37, 120--> 00: 52:39, 361
Oh, this is self-defense.
Fully justifiable.

00:52:42, 192--> 00: 52:43, 398
Nice work.

00:52:43, 760--> 00: 52:44, 704
Thanks.

00:53:13, 790--> 00: 53:14, 530


00:53:14, 991--> 00: 53:15, 833
How long?
Two more minutes.

00:53:16, 126--> 00: 53:17, 434
Make it one and a half.

00:53:18, 195--> 00: 53:21, 199
Everybody, hurry, hurry.

00:53:24, 467--> 00: 53:25, 571
His name is...

00:53:26, 436--> 00: 53:30, 714
Muhammad Akeem Bin Fatah Ulama
Ahmed Salim Fahid Abdulla Hasan.

00:53:31, 208--> 00: 53:32, 710
Nevermind, we're calling him Bob.

00:53:34, 277--> 00: 53:37, 349
These guys are as evil as they come.
They kill children for fun.

00:53:37, 647--> 00: 53:40, 184
If they've got your wife,
It's not looking to good for her, pal.

00:53:42, 185--> 00: 53:43, 789
They are about to do something big.

00:53:44, 554--> 00: 53:45, 897
We have to stop them.

00:53:46, 623--> 00: 53:47, 601
Ready?

00:53:49, 326--> 00: 53:50, 361
For what?

00:53:51, 127--> 00: 53:53, 664
-To kill Bob and his goons.
-Maybe you misunderstood something here.

00:53:54, 064--> 00: 53:56, 340
-I'm not helping you.
-Listen to me.

00:53:56, 633--> 00: 53:58, 579
-They have a nuke.
-Here?

00:53:59, 202--> 00: 54:02, 581
-Yeah. I need your help, Rip.
-No. No, wait, wait.

00:54:03, 640--> 00: 54:05, 085
I'm not going in there with you.

00:54:05, 675--> 00: 54:07, 245
-It's too intense.
-Rip.

00:54:07, 911--> 00: 54:09, 482
If I go out there and get killed, 
you'll end up alone and be forced  

00:54:09, 547--> 00: 54:12, 349
to save the world and your wife all by yourself.

00:54:13, 049--> 00: 54:14, 357
Is that what you want?

00:54:17, 354--> 00: 54:20, 130
Allright fine. Um, 
let's do things my way allright

00:54:20, 423--> 00: 54:22, 425
We sneak the rest of the way
and try to find my wife first.

00:54:23, 660--> 00: 54:25, 333
I think we better go ahead 
and do things my way.

00:54:25, 562--> 00: 54:27, 269
No, no, my way!

00:54:28, 965--> 00: 54:32, 936
Loud and proud, baby.
The American Way.

00:55:10, 707--> 00: 55:12, 516
Break out the violins.

00:55:37, 233--> 00: 55:38, 439
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:55:39, 202--> 00: 55:41, 239
Put it there, Zubri!

00:55:43, 239--> 00: 55:44, 081
Move.

00:55:59, 122--> 00: 56:00, 430
This is your Virgin, Bob.

00:56:05, 862--> 00: 56:09, 241
You! Are ... right?

00:56:57, 046--> 00: 56:57, 922
Now I'm out.

00:57:01, 551--> 00: 57:03, 199
-You got any more tricks up your sleeve huh?
-Just one.

00:57:03, 252--> 00: 57:03, 594


00:57:05, 388--> 00: 57:06, 696
Kicking ass!

00:57:33, 583--> 00: 57:35, 358
Now I'm out.

00:57:36, 352--> 00: 57:37, 956
Exact number of bullets.

01:00:07, 904 --> 01:00:13, 547
At lomg last, for the first time,
in over 6,000 years.

01:00:14, 644 --> 01:00:17, 750
I have brought you here
for a great purpose.

01:00:24, 287--> 01:00:26, 324
There is much to be done.

01:01:33, 589 --> 01:01:36, 536
Put it inside, and close it tight.

01:02:22, 472 --> 01:02:23, 382
Hurry.

01:02:35, 518 --> 01:02:36 724
Where? Where?

01:02:39, 122 --> 01:02:40, 692
Nothing's wrong?

01:02:46, 129 --> 01:02:48, 006
Leave me, leave me.

01:02:50, 032 --> 01:02:51, 010
Go.

01:03:00, 243 --> 01:03:07, 092
Come.

01:03:08, 818 --> 01:03:11, 958
It's about time that you warmed up to me.

01:05:12, 875 --> 01:05:15, 253
The genie has obtained the material.

01:05:16, 279 --> 01:05:19, 260
You woman distract me from Jihad!

01:05:21, 684 --> 01:05:22, 890
Bring the chest.

01:05:31, 627 --> 01:05:32, 697
I got it.

01:05:36, 299 --> 01:05:38, 939
The genie that belongs inside of it,
now that he's free,

01:05:41, 404 --> 01:05:43, 127
It will be used in unspeakable ways.

01:05:43, 140 --> 01:05:44, 874
Well, how do I stop it?

01:05:45, 608 --> 01:05:48, 885
You must drib the fresh blood of
a virgin girl into the mouth of the skull

01:05:49, 145--> 01:05:51, 682
and recite an ancient Arabic recall passage

01:05:51, 847--> 01:05:53, 690
in order to get the genie back into the skull

01:05:54, 083--> 01:05:55, 960
and to save your friend's life.

01:05:57, 687 --> 01:05:58, 927
Allright, so who's the Virgin?

01:05:59, 288 --> 01:06:00, 289
I am.

01:06:00, 323 --> 01:06:02, 368
Ok, do you know what to say?

01:06:02, 725 --> 01:06:04, 796
I know exactly what to say,

01:06:05, 461 --> 01:06:07, 873
-Word for Word.
-OK, good. Let's go.

01:06:42, 064 --> 01:06:49, 482
-Allah Akbar.
-Allah Akbar.

01:06:51, 007--> 01:06:52, 452
Well, I'm sorry.
What was it again?

01:06:59,  448 -->01:07:00, 518
I'm ok.

01:07:01, 717 --> 01:07:03, 287
Look at my lips, huh?

01:07:10, 659 --> 01:07:11, 967
I can't do that.

01:07:21, 070 --> 01:07:22, 378
Allright, this is bad.

01:07:23, 005 --> 01:07:26, 043
-You haven't said it right, not even once.
-Sorry. It's weird.

01:07:26, 275 --> 01:07:28, 084
Just give me a few more tries,
I'll spit it out.

01:07:28, 644 --> 01:07:30, 920
You might only have the chance
to say it once.

01:08:03, 646 --> 01:08:05, 216
Come here, son of a bitch!

01:08:07, 349 --> 01:08:09, 590
Papa, it's gone!

01:08:18, 194 --> 01:08:20, 606
Careful, careful!

01:08:43, 686 --> 01:08:46, 098
No!

01:08:54, 263 --> 01:08:56, 470
Run!

01:09:16,  418--> 01:09:17, 453
You did it.

01:09:18, 387 --> 01:09:19, 798
In English.

01:09:21, 724 --> 01:09:22, 828
What's wrong?

01:09:26, 061 --> 01:09:30, 066
When a persons blood is used on the skull,
a life is taken

01:09:30, 399 --> 01:09:32, 072
You didn't mention that. No.

01:09:32, 968 --> 01:09:35, 448
I knew you would not have done it
if you would know.

01:09:35, 704 --> 01:09:42, 553
-Why? I'm responsible for you.
-No. I did this. I cut myself.

01:09:43, 579 --> 01:09:46, 685
I did it to save the others.
For Aisha.

01:10:10, 039 --> 01:10:11, 677
You see what that girl did for you?

01:10:11, 941 --> 01:10:13, 716
I hope you realize...

01:10:16, 312 --> 01:10:17, 347
Hey, you okay?

01:10:18, 380 --> 01:10:19, 654
Are you yourself?

01:10:21, 116 --> 01:10:23, 357
I feel so dirty.

01:10:27, 356 --> 01:10:28, 835
He violated me.

01:10:30, 593 --> 01:10:33, 199
So it's kind of like you went to prison

01:10:35, 264 --> 01:10:38, 268
Thanks buddy. I owe you one.

01:10:39, 568 --> 01:10:41, 275
Allright, let's go save my wife.

01:10:41, 403 --> 01:10:43, 314
If we don't stop the meltdown and get the bomb

01:10:44, 240 --> 01:10:45, 082
We're all dead.

01:10:45, 641 --> 01:10:47, 177
Fine, let's hurry.

01:11:19, 341 --> 01:11:21, 321
Follow me!
Yes!

01:11:22, 378 --> 01:11:23, 716
This way!

01:11:44, 266 --> 01:11:47, 611
We are close, but we may still 
need our insurance policy.

01:11:48, 003--> 01:11:49, 243
Go and get it.

01:11:54, 276 --> 01:11:55, 949
It's all sealed.

01:11:56, 745 --> 01:11:59, 521
Now the bomb.
And then your wife.

01:12:00, 783 --> 01:12:02, 456
You're not looking to good, pal.

01:12:03, 319--> 01:12:04, 593
You know, I was just thinking.

01:12:06, 288 --> 01:12:07, 892
If she sees you.

01:12:08, 257 --> 01:12:09, 634
She'll believe me, she will love me again.

01:12:10, 392 --> 01:12:13, 236
Yeah, and maybe you'll get lucky tonight, huh?

01:12:14, 797 --> 01:12:15, 969
Come on, get up.

01:12:17, 166 --> 01:12:19, 043
I want my life back.

01:12:20, 035 --> 01:12:21, 105
And my work.

01:12:23, 005 --> 01:12:25, 451
If they'd all could see you were real,
I'd get my job back.

01:12:25, 908 --> 01:12:28, 286
You don't really want to get back
to that job, do you?

01:12:29, 712 --> 01:12:31, 350
I like chasing bad guys.

01:12:31, 947 --> 01:12:33, 893
Well, then, get up
and let's go get some.

01:12:38, 921 --> 01:12:42, 164
Come on. Is that all you
got for me tonight?

01:12:42, 791 --> 01:12:43, 792
Get up.

01:12:51, 800 --> 01:12:54, 280
-Use me as a shield.
-It'll be fun.

01:15:12, 407 --> 01:15:16, 446
-Allah!
-Carrie!

Rip!

Hey buddy, can you do me a favor?

Can I see my wife please?

I wish I could pal.

But you're on your own for good this time.

What? Don't you just heal back 
and back up again?

Not this time.

God, I'm gonna die.

Hey, look at the bright side.
I'm finally out of your hair.

This hurts man
Tell me about it

Huh? It even hurts you?

I mean you being a bloodsucker and all.

Hey Rip.
Yeah.

I got a stake through my heart.

Hey, what's your name anyway?

Who has protected you from me today?

You may wanna step a little closer, pal.

Can't you see we're both dying here, you idiot?

No one has protected you for
the angels fight for me!

I know what angels you're talking about.

The ones with sulphur breath,
you just got lucky that's all.

Luck has nothing got to do with it

Allah, most merciful watches over me
and guides us in Jihad!

Then why don't you show some
of that mercy to my wife?

Let her go.

Let me tell you what I will 
do to your filthy pig of a wife!

I'm going to take her head off.

Nice and slow!

I will give you her head
if you're still alive.

Maybe I will bring in a video
so that you can watch.

I'll tell you where you can stick that knife.

I already know where to stick it.
Yeah?

Come on over here and show me.

Don't you fool, it's a trick!

Come on, chicken shit!

Don't go anywhere
I'll be here.

Don't you touch her!
Or what?

What are you going to do?

Listen to me, very carefully.

I want you to get a sword
and chop his head off.

Then I want you to take his fangs
and give them to me.

And then put his head in 
a mirrored box and bury it.

Do you understand?

We have seen the last of your kind.
Enjoy your pain!

Please don't!

Oh, please don't!

I wish I was dead so I didn't have to hear this.

No! Don't! Don't cut me!

You bastard, you bit me!

I just saved your life.
No you didn't, you just killed me!

Whatever, You said you wished you were dead


Oh, so you're still a genie!


You were gonna die anyway.
Now you'll still be around.

So ... I can still save her?

Yes, but you won't be able to be with here again.

But she's my wife.
I don't make the rules, trust me okay?

Besides, I bet your vow was
"till death do us part" Well...

Now you're dead ... so part.

Allright Look, fuck, can we,lets just 
agree this of so I can get back there?

Relax for a second,
what time is passing?

We're in the spiritual world now...

When you get back, you better hurry up.

Every few hundred years we pass a torch.

When we're tired we find a place for it

I'm sorry, I gotta go.

You gonna be okay?

You set me up.

You tricked me.
Would you have given up if I hadn't told you?

I've been training you...

Come on, get up!

Come on, get up.

Nice work

I'll let you live
Don't bite me!

I've given you a gift
Oh, a gift!

You have a commitment to justice
unlike anyone I've ever seen.

You're stubborn, determined,
all the things you need to be.

So I can, still be good?
I'm counting on it.

Get up and let's go get some

A good vampire.

I guess I can do that.

You start now.

IRS building.
Headquarters, downstairs.

Death and taxes, baby.

Save the world, Rip.

And save your wife.

The rules are simple,
drink their blood after you kill them.

Or else they'll come back.

Go get them.

Stay on night shift.

And I almost forgot,
my name is....

What were you gonna do with my wife huh?

Was it this?

Look at me.

I'm so sorry.

If only I had listened.

If only I'd quit you first.

Stay with me.

I'm sorry.

I gotta go.

Open wide.

And say Allah.

No Zubri, Zubri, no, no! Zubri, Zubri!!!

Go ahead and kill me!

Tonight I will be in paradise enjoying my virgins.
And pleasures you can only dream of.

Yeah, you're not going to paradise.

Here's a preview...
of what you have to look forward to.

And where you're going,
you are the virgins!

It's her smile I miss the most.

It's my fault things headed this way really.

We're sorry to see him go,
but he must have picked you for a reason.

Welcome aboard,
we are honored to have you.

He's gone Sir, he's gone.
But he did find his replacement.

Have him checked out.

Make sure we're still save.

Why? 

840 
Most people have no idea 
what kinds of things, monsters really exist.

841 
It creeps me out.

842 
Evil is out there and I'm gonna find it
and I'll put it where it belongs 
even if I have to do it alone.

843 
The Devil's gonna pay.

844 
I know what I'm doing.

845 
I think.
