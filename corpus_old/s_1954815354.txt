     YOUNG GIRL: <i> I read in</i>
 <i> the "Little Big Book of Birds"</i>

     <i> that ravens were once</i>
    <i> the most colorful birds.</i>

  <i> But they were vain and mean</i>

      <i> and never recognized</i>
         <i> their beauty.</i>

       <i> They were too busy</i>
   <i> being unkind to each other</i>

     <i> so they were stripped</i>
      <i> of all their colors</i>

       <i> and turned black.</i>

  <i> They are considered so evil</i>
    <i> that their favorite food</i>

         <i> is said to be</i>
    <i> the flesh of a dead man.</i>

     <i> But ravens really like</i>
  <i> to be together, like family.</i>

      <i> Let me introduce you</i>
         <i> to my ravens.</i>

       ( PHONE RINGING )

What's up, man?

Look, it'll just be
a couple of days.

They're good people.

You got nothing
to worry about, all right?

     C'mon, Mom, let's go.

     MOTHER:<i> You know what?</i>
         <i> You go ahead.</i>

          <i> I just want</i>
     <i> a minute alone, okay?</i>

          Fine, grump.

                  Hello, ladies.

      Hi.

             ( MUMBLES ) ...Dad.
             Can we go swimming?

We'll go in a little bit.
          JOEY:<i> Why?</i>

'Cause I want to talk
to your Mom.

                  Promise?

I promise.

            Okay.
            See you at the dock.

             ELLIS:
      <i> How was the flight?</i>

            Not bad,
        a little bumpy.

                           Yeah?

               Glad you're here.

            Me too.

     ( VOICES CHATTERING )

          Wendy, hey.
           Oh my God.

     Come here, group hug,
           group hug.

      WENDY: <i> Here you go.</i>

   Yeah? Nice.

              Oh my God,
              this is Saturn.

           She's my life partner
           for now.

We had to put
the finishing touches

on the art car
for Burning Man,

       <i> so we just worked</i>
           <i> all night,</i>

         hopped in the vangina
         and, boom, here we are.

 All right, well,
 if you need anything, just ask.

Yeah, I will.

You're a Virgo,
aren't you?

               Triple.

That is so sexy.

          ( SIGHING )

The truth
is always beautiful.

              Mm-hm.
              Thanks, all right.

     MAN: <i> There they are.</i>
          <i> Good times.</i>

           Come here.

     You blinked.
                  No, I didn't.

      You did.

Now go get your victorious

               Why don't you get
               your provider-Dad

           one of those as well?

        Ohh, come here.

    Show Emma where you keep
     the Chardonnay, okay?

 ELLIS: <i> Let's grab a round of</i>
 <i> small ball this weekend, yeah?</i>

What's a small ball?

           Golf, darling.
           It's very, very dull.

       <i> Here's your room.</i>

          Oh, this is very nice.

       We've never stayed
     on this floor before.

                     Oh, really?

          I didn't realize that.

   Yeah, we stay in the room
        by the kitchen,

      the maid's quarters.

          ( SIGHING )

 What? I'm not saying anything
  underneath what I'm saying.

   I'm simply stating a fact.

             Well, Joey's really
             excited to see you.

          All she can talk about
          is you.

She's a smart kid.

             Try and spend
             some time with her.

             It'll mean so much.

             WENDY:
     You know Jay's coming.

    He's supposed to be here
           for dinner

   but he's bringing a guest.

   I guess he needed a ride.

         You know Jay.

            At least
    he has a new girlfriend.

     He seems rather happy.

     ( INDISTINCT CHATTER )

The drink always goes
on the right side.

   <i> This is the incorrect side</i>

       or the left side.

Put it on the right side.

          I think I'm
     going to make a toast.

Ellis and I
want to thank you so much

for coming to our home
and celebrating with us.

      We really appreciate
   you making the commitment

    <i> every summer to come to</i>
 <i> our annual 4th of July party.</i>

     <i> Tradition is important</i>
 <i> and you mean the world to us.</i>

        So cheers, to us

         So how's work, Big Guy?

                 SAUL:
                <i> It's fantastic.</i>

When everyone in Hollywood
is bitching about the recession,

              I haven't felt
              a goddamned thing.

        <i> My new book</i>
       <i> hasn't even come out yet</i>

           and I've already sold
           the movie rights.

              Wow.

Yes, not caving to
commercialism is a real feat

for you, isn't it,
darling?

             And you don't
             seem to be bothered

               by the lifestyle
               its afforded you.

       Honey, can you get
        some more wine?

          Yeah, sure.

        <i> Joey, could you</i>
       <i> bring us a bottle</i>

  <i> of the '63 Chateau Lafleur,</i>
            <i> please?</i>

                      We're out.

  <i> We have the 2009 Twin Oaks.</i>

That's fine. Why don't you bring
        us two of those?

             JOEY:

    HAL:<i> I was told I'd get</i>
      <i> everything I desire,</i>

  and you guys are kind of
  dropping the ball on this one.

     Desire is everything.

That's why I don't have sex.

     <i> Not like you guys do.</i>

    Anyway, Hal, let's hear
    what have you been up to

      <i> in your crazy world?</i>

      Well, got certified
        as a life coach.

           Certified.

     What exactly is that,
         a life coach?

              HAL:
     <i> Life is a game, Emma.</i>

  You weren't born a starter.

           None of us
      were born a starter.

    <i> I mean, take Wendy here,</i>
          <i> for example,</i>

      I mean, humble beginnings,
      to say the least.

  <i> There was a time at Berkeley</i>
<i>when she wouldn't be caught dead</i>

                hanging out
                with you people.

       But now, she's on
       the varsity squad.

         <i> That's my job.</i>

         <i> I get you guys</i>
         <i> off the bench.</i>

    What's keeping you from
  taking it to the next level?

    <i> What are you afraid of?</i>

           What truth
      are you hiding from?

   When the student is ready,
    the master will appear.

    this is my buddy, Chad.

           It's okay?

       ELLIS: It's okay.
     WENDY: <i> Hi, Jay bird.</i>

       JAY: <i> Hey sister.</i>
   WENDY: <i> Glad you made it.</i>

   So I'm headed into
   the back country tomorrow.

   <i> I met this cute hippy chick.</i>

   We're gonna let our
   animal instincts run wild.

   Chad's gonna let me use
   his truck off road.

   <i> Is it cool if he stays here</i>
   <i> for a few days?</i>

   Absolutely.

   Yeah.

   SAUL:
    <i> The more the merrier.</i>

   JAY: <i> Cool.</i>
   <i> Chad makes films.</i>

   What kind of films?

   Nature films.

   What are they about?

   Nature.

   Well, you know what
   Thoreau said about nature.

It has no morality,

       only what mankind
        imposes upon it.

       You're Saul King?

        Yes.

      I've read four books
           in my life

       and three of them
          were yours.

    What was the other one?

              JAY:
<i>"The Little Big Book of Birds."</i>

        I memorized it.

       It's about birds.

       "A Covey of Coots"
           was funny

      but I thought it was
     gonna be about birds.

        It's a metaphor.

    JAY: <i> I especially liked</i>
       <i> "A Cast of Hawks"</i>

             but it wasn't
             about birds either.

       It was strange, you know,

      you really could have said
      something interesting.

   <i> Where do you get the ideas</i>
        <i> for your books?</i>

I think of them.

            Can I interview you?

               About your books.

          Maybe later.

                      What time?

         I don't know.
                  Okay. Can I--

                I'm so sorry,
                can I sleep now?

       My room's at the top
       of the hall, to the left.

       Do you want some dessert?

                  No thank you.

             Okay.

             JOEY:
           <i> Goodnight.</i>

Hey, a nightcap?

      Yeah, something like that.

God, you look beautiful.

            You really think so?

Absolutely.

                   No. No, Saul.

( LAUGHING )
What's wrong?

                    No. I can't.

      You know, it's funny

    'cause I don't remember
        you ever writing

        the entire time
       we were together.

     <i> I don't even remember</i>
      <i> you reading a book.</i>

It's like you left me
and changed into somebody else.

             Look, I'm by myself
             all the time.

          Writing is a God-awful
          existence.

  You should be grateful
  you blocked my creative voice.

         It would have been hell
         to live with.

             CHAD:
             <i> Wendy?</i>

                 Yes, Chad?

 I'm ready for my dessert now.

                     Sure.

in that mind of his?

He started filming me today.

           Yes, well,
 he's filming everybody, Saul.

Yes, but he's making
a documentary about me,

his favorite writer.

I think he's some sort of
a lunatic fan.

         <i> Where did Jay</i>
         <i> meet this guy?</i>

         I don't know,
          but I just--

    I don't fully trust him
         with the kids.

               Okay. Well, then,
               he's got to go.

             Okay.

                   Okay.

Look at us, co-parenting.

    So who's gonna tell him?

I'll tell him.

                  I'll tell him.

Hey, Chad.

        I've upset you.

          WENDY: <i> No.</i>

    It's just that it's not
        gonna work out.

          The truth is
      we weren't expecting

         another person
         this weekend.

         I understand.

            Do you?

              Yes.

       I appreciate that.

        You've all been
       really nice to me.

  I wish I could pay it back.

           Bye, Chad.

Where's Chad going?

         He had to leave, honey.

             JOEY:
            <i> But why?</i>

Well, people
are like gardens.

      <i> Gardens and flowers</i>
        <i> want to blossom</i>

      <i> but weeds overpower</i>
           <i> everything</i>

and flowers learn
to tolerate weeds

but if they can't,
the weeds need to be pulled

to save the garden.

          Who decides
         what's a weed?

Joey, just don't make
any sudden movements.

                Not coming with?

No, thank you.

    <i> Just gonna take a walk.</i>

      I'll walk with you.

          Yeah, sure,
  if it's all right with Hal.

            SATURN:
     <i> I didn't have a family</i>

     <i> so it's really lovely</i>
 <i> to see one with so much love.</i>

     ELLIS: <i> Why didn't you</i>
         <i> have a family?</i>

                Oh, my dad died
                when I was young

            and my mom took off
            on her Saturn return

and I've been on my own
since I was 14.

14, that's young.

                 No, no, no, no.
                 It was perfect.

         To be free at that age,

         not having to repress
         all that sexual energy,

    I can't imagine having lived
    any differently.

            I definitely learned
            a thing or two.

I can imagine you did.

You need to fuck
my yoni puja.

                Wow.

         Wow, that's flattering.

                I appreciate it.

             But I love my wife.

That's okay.
I do too.

I would love to please
both of you.

Okay, Saturn,
I need you to stop.

This entire conversation
is making me very uncomfortable.

    I haven't felt like this
     since my father died.

      ( CAMERA CLICKING )

                     Chad?

        There's a tribe
        of tit warblers

nesting
in that juniper tree.

         SATURN: Where?
       I don't see them.

   CHAD: <i> They're more easily</i>
        <i> heard than seen.</i>

         I have gifts.

   ELLIS: <i> Look who I found,</i>
           <i> everybody.</i>

                    It's Chad.

               He brought gifts.

                  Awesome.

          Gifts? Why?

For being so kind to me.
To pay it back.

         Chad, you didn't
         have to do that.

       Yes, Wendy, I did.

     Ellis, this is for you
  because Wendy loved flowers.

                  Oh, beautiful.

       <i> I thank you, Chad,</i>
    <i> for your floral support.</i>

           And Saul?

      Yeah?
         CHAD: <i> Saul?</i>

      Yeah?

             Saul?
      Yeah?

             Saul?
    Yeah?

     <i> Saul, this is for you.</i>

          ( LAUGHING )

  EMMA: <i> Oh, very interesting</i>
         <i> choice, Chad.</i>

           <i> I like it.</i>

            Oh! Ah,
   I have something for you.

        So you brought him back?

             ELLIS:
         <i> He's harmless.</i>

             CHAD:
    <i> For our lemonade stand.</i>

             JOEY:
            Perfect.

Why are you
standing so awkwardly?

   I'll go stand over there.

             JOEY:
    <i> No, I didn't mean that.</i>

I meant, are you feeling
uncomfortable?

                      Yeah.

       Most of the time.

    All the time, actually.

             JOEY:
              <i> Why?</i>

        It's how I feel.

       Take a seat, Chad.

If we're going to be
best friends,

we have to tell
each other a secret,

      <i> a secret we've never</i>
       <i> told anyone else.</i>

       I have to tell you
           a secret?

         I left school
      when I was your age.

  I preferred watching birds.

           But I have
     an even bigger secret.

            Really?

    I chose you as my friend
    because you're perfect.

      Or just I'm amazing.

        You are amazing.

      What amazing things
 do you think I'm going to do?

       No, if I tell you
    you'll think I'm silly.

        Please tell me.

      I think you're gonna
       make people smile.

  <i> That's important, you know?</i>

      And I'm pretty sure
    you're gonna cure cancer

       and end hate too,

    <i> so you've got a big life</i>
        <i> in front of you.</i>

      Cool, you're right.

             CHAD:
           <i> Your turn.</i>

      Everyone lies to me.

              Why?

  'Cause they think the truth
       will hurt me more.

      You have to promise
    not to lie to me, okay?

            Promise.

     So I'm raising equity
       for a new startup.

    <i> We're in our very first</i>
      <i> round of financing.</i>

I thought it might be something
    you'd be interested in.

   Okay, what's the company?

        It's not so much
      of a company per se

      as it is seed money.

   <i> Investing in the daily cog</i>
          <i> of my life.</i>

   What you'd be investing in
        is my expertise.

        Your expertise?

You're a trust fund kid, Ellis.

 I wouldn't know your expertise
if you put a handgun to my head.

   <i> Anyway, a high percentage</i>
     <i> of these startups fail</i>

  and there's always the risk
 of losing your friend's money

      and the friendship.

        I'm just asking
   for a little bit of help.

          Look, Ellis,
   the last thing that I want

  is for these family reunions

       <i> to turn more into</i>
   <i> what the startup is doing</i>

     than about catching up
    with friends and family.

       I just don't think
       I'm the right guy.

              Yup.

     Yup, well, your loss.

          ( BUZZING )

                Agh! Bees, bees!

     He's such an asshole.

    We were supposed to play
    the small ball tonight.

         Hey, at least
      we have each other.

             <i> Right?</i>

      ( BRAKES SQUEALING )

   I got attacked by a whole
    goddamned swarm of bees.

    It's this fucking shirt.

  Jesus, it's like they think
  they can smell nectar on me

         <i> or something.</i>

             CHAD:
      <i> Bees can sense fear.</i>

          ( GASPING )

                   Sorry. Sorry.

He did this on purpose.

            Did what on purpose?

Give me a shirt
that was meant to kill me.

              ( LAUGHING )
              That's ridiculous.

       Is it?

     Jay's coming back tomorrow.

            Let's just let it go
            for now, okay?

Oh, that feels good.

You're very pretty.

                         Thanks.

  C'mon.

              No.
     C'mon.

      I'm not in the mood.

Then how about
just doing it for me?

                I don't want to.

Come on, Wendy.

         Ellis, I don't want to.

         Are you still
       in love with him?

With who?

             Saul.

                    Saul, Wendy.

   No. Why?

  <i> Did he say something to you?</i>

              No.

  No, he didn't say anything.

         <i> I could see it</i>
       <i> with my own eyes.</i>

          Look, maybe
   I'm the small person here

  but this whole being friends
   with the ex-husband thing,

          it's weird.

    I have a child with him.

      I mean, what do you
         want me to do?

      I want to feel like
     you love me the most.

      I don't want to talk
  about this right now, okay?

      We have a full house
           of guests.

      What more can I do?

             WENDY:
             <i> Ellis.</i>

             What--
      what more can I do?

        Ellis.

                            Huh?

        I can't do this.

           I'm sorry.

        Look--

       How much rejection
     am I supposed to take?

      ( CAMERA CLICKING )

   CHAD: <i> What's the best nap</i>
       <i> you've ever taken?</i>

       When I was little,
 I used to pretend to be asleep

        so I could hear
 my mom and dad talk about me.

They would say,
"That one's a goner"

and then my dad would pick me up
and carry me to bed.

                     Yeah?

         How about you?

        I haven't really
 fallen asleep in a long time.

             CHAD:
          <i> Hey, buddy.</i>

          Do you think
        a kitty hurt it?

      Baby birds fall or--

     and sometimes they get
    pushed from their nest.

              Why?

             CHAD:
        <i> To learn to fly.</i>

          That's mean.

        No, it's normal.

     And if it's feathered,
        it's a fledgling

     and has left the nest
          on its own.

       <i> Then you leave it</i>
      <i> where you found it.</i>

      <i> If it's unfeathered,</i>
   <i> then you look for a nest.</i>

      And if you find it,
     you can bring it home.

             Chad!
          Wait for me.

        You've got to be
      fucking kidding me.

        <i> Joey, I want you</i>
    <i> to come down right now.</i>

    I want you to come down
   on solid ground right now.

        Why do you care?

     I'm gonna count to 10.

          You mean 3.

           I mean 10!

              One.

  <i> Joey, don't make me come up,</i>
      <i> up there, after you.</i>

     I want you to get down
     from there right now.

          Okay, fine,
      I'll come up there.

      I can climb a tree.

    I don't know why anybody
    would ever want to climb

         <i> a goddamn tree</i>
  <i> and bring a little child up.</i>

    <i> Let's all climb a tree,</i>

       <i> let's climb trees</i>
       <i> and free the birds</i>

       and because then,
       everything's good

      and our wives aren't
      emotionally distant.

          Goddamn it!

       <i> Don't look at me.</i>

          Look at me.

         I actually go
      to the driving range

  which is ironic considering
 that my golf game is for shit.

 Just like the rest of my life.

    And then if I'm really,

 He barely even looks at Joey.

      Well, I don't think
        liking children

  has anything to do with it.

 <i> I think he just wants to have</i>
     <i> something of his own,</i>

    <i> something that he made.</i>

    He's made up this story
         about himself

 and now he's convinced himself
        that it's true.

       Are you pregnant?

No.
Why, do I look fat?

                    No.

              No, I just thought
              since you said

     Saul wanted to have a baby.

Wendy, I am not just a vessel
for that man's needs.

You know, my body is not here
merely just to deliver a child.

I told him to get
his own uterus.

Or have it with someone else.

  And you know Saul, tell him
 he can't have something and--

         He tricked me.

        What did you do?

              I--

       The love is lost.

show me something

 a little less expensive?

         <i> Chad, please.</i>

        <i> Don't leave me.</i>

      JOEY: ( NARRATING )
         <i> I had a dream.</i>

   <i> I was as light as a bird,</i>

        <i> a spirit flying</i>
        <i> through the air,</i>

        <i> and I could see</i>
     <i> my home and my family.</i>

      <i> But then I woke up.</i>

    <i> And I was on the ground.</i>

       <i> When you step out</i>
          <i> of a dream,</i>

        <i> things are never</i>
        <i> what they seem.</i>

   <i> What you thought was real,</i>
      <i> wasn't real at all.</i>

           <i> Nothing is</i>
       <i> as bright or clear</i>

         <i> but the dream</i>
        <i> is always there.</i>

     <i> And it gives you hope</i>
  <i> that one day it will return</i>

     <i> and, if you're lucky,</i>

           <i> you'll see</i>
       <i> your friend again.</i>

       It's so beautiful.

             Yeah.

             JOEY:
     <i> Some birds fly alone.</i>

        <i> They're the ones</i>
     <i> that fly the highest,</i>

       <i> can see the most.</i>

     <i> They can fly so high,</i>
<i>that they vanish into thin air,</i>

         <i> like a dream.</i>

       Don't worry, Mom.

          are in here.

         <i> Â¶ I'll see you</i>

  <i> Â¶ Your heart stole me away Â¶</i>

        <i> Â¶ And I dreamed</i>
       <i> Of you every day Â¶</i>

    <i> Â¶ But I know your heart</i>
      <i> Will never be mine Â¶</i>

   <i> Â¶ So I'll say my fare thee</i>
    <i> Well as my tears fall Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ How sadly they tell</i>
        <i> How your heart Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ Will never be mine Â¶</i>

   <i> Â¶ I know we're never to be</i>
           <i> Oh dear Â¶</i>

       <i> Â¶ I fear my heart</i>
        <i> Is lost to you Â¶</i>

   <i> Â¶ My dear sweet how madly</i>
       <i> I fell for thee Â¶</i>

     <i> Â¶ Now I fear my heart</i>
        <i> Is lost to you Â¶</i>

        <i> Is lost to you Â¶</i>
