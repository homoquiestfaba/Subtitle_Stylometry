{\an8}[Elle and Noah shouting]

{\an8}[Elle] <i>Well, after graduation,</i>

{\an8}<i>Noah, Lee, Rachel and I decided
to take one week and go on a road trip,</i>

{\an8}<i>just the four of us.</i>

{\an8}<i>And while I was busy putting off
the inevitable decision</i>

{\an8}<i>between the two colleges
where I got acceptedâ€¦</i>

{\an8}[Lee] So, what about you?

{\an8}I... I got wait-listed.

{\an8}Both Berkeley and Harvard.

{\an8}<i>I was fully focused on making sure
we all had as much fun as possible.</i>

{\an8}- [shouts]
[Elle] <i>And that's exactly what we did.</i>

{\an8}<i>Let me run you through the highlights.</i>

{\an8}<i>On our way up to Northern California,
we camped in the woods.</i>

{\an8}- [Lee] Hey!
[Elle] <i>Went fishing on a lake.</i>

{\an8}<i>Fed some wildlife,
caught some waves at Big Sur.</i>

{\an8}<i>Watched Noah becoming friends with Rachel.</i>

{\an8}<i>Watched Lee watch Noah
becoming friendsÂ with Rachel.</i>

{\an8}<i>Watched a shooting star
with someone special.</i>

{\an8}Oh, my God!

{\an8}<i>Saw the fish at the aquarium in Monterey.</i>

{\an8}<i>Saw a sunset with colors
I had never seen before.</i>

{\an8}<i>And got a reminder</i>
<i>about rule number 19.Â </i>[sighs]

{\an8}<i>Decided to think about it later.</i>

{\an8}<i>- Drove to San Francisco.</i>
[bell ringing]

{\an8}<i>Went to Fisherman's Wharf.</i>

{\an8}<i>- Ate clam chowder out of a bread bowl.</i>
[all chattering]

{\an8}<i>- </i>[Elle] <i>Watched the sea lions on Pier 39.</i>
[animals bark]

{\an8}<i>Watched our naughty video
from chemistry lab.</i>

{\an8}[chuckles] <i>Destroyed our naughty video</i>
<i>from chemistry lab.</i>

{\an8}<i>- Rode tandem bikes in Golden Gate Park.</i>
[laughing]


{\an8}<i>- Caught a movie.</i>
[laughing]

{\an8}<i>- Caught a concert.</i>
[cheering]

{\an8}[Elle] <i>Even caught a baseball</i>
<i>in a kayak outside Oracle Parkâ€¦</i>

{\an8}Whoa, whoa!

{\an8}- [Lee] It's coming!
I got it! [gasps]

{\an8}- Whoa.
[Lee] Whoa!

{\an8}- [stadium fans cheering]
Oh, my God!

{\an8}Oh, my God!

{\an8}<i>But the absolute best
was watching the Bay Lights</i>

{\an8}<i>with my favorite two guys in the world.</i>

{\an8}<i>But when you decide to escape reality,</i>

{\an8}<i>you know that eventually
you're gonna have to come back to it.</i>

{\an8}<i>So, when we got back home,</i>

{\an8}<i>I got a job so I could make some money
for college,</i>

{\an8}<i>whichever one I wind up going to.</i>

{\an8}Oh, hey, guysâ€¦

{\an8}<i>But as hard as that was for me to decide,</i>

{\an8}<i>a few days later</i>,
<i>things got even more complicated</i>

{\an8}<i>when Noah asked
a very unexpected questionâ€¦</i>

Mmm!

So, anyway, I was thinking, uhâ€¦

when you get off the wait-list
for Harvard, maybe you and I

could go off-campus
and get an apartment together.

Wait. You mean, likeâ€¦
like, get our own place?

Yeah, look. [clears throat]

I've been online all day.
There's some pretty cool places.

What?

You wanna live with me?
No.

with you.Â I wanna do everything with you.

Really?
Yes, really.

How long do we have till Lee gets back?
I don't know.

[Elle sighs, laughs]

Geronimo!

No, no, no, no, no, no! [screams]
[Noah] Oh, shit!


Hey, guys. Look what I got.
Ooh!


Thank you.
You're welcome.

[cell phone rings]


Is everything okay?

Yeah, fine.

Um, in factâ€¦
Hmm.


Yes, I would like that very much.
Yeah, I thought you might.

See you.
Where are you two going?

Hmm. Noah wants to read me poetry
and tell me all about his feelings.

Really? Is that what you wanna go with?
[clattering]

[laughing]
[Lee] Smooth move!


Oh, I wanted to show this to you.


I have painstakingly coordinated
my Berkeley schedule

with your Rhode Island School of Design
schedule.

[Rachel] Aww.
First up, we've got Labor Day.

I know it's early in the semester,
but it's a long weekend,

and I'm pretty damn sure
I'm gonna be having my Rachel withdrawals.

That could work.

Of course it'll work. We'll make it work.


This place is so nice.
Thank you for bringing us here.

Well, we wanted
to finally take you somewhere special

to help celebrate your graduation.

So, any big plans for the summer?

Well, actually, now that you mention it,

we were all talking about heading over
to the beach house this weekend,

if that's cool.

Is everything okay?

Yeah, everything's fine.
Um, we just have some news for you.

We are planning to sell the beach house.


It doesn't make sense
to hold on to it anymore.

Now that you kids
are going off to college.

You know, the upkeep
on the place is hardly worth it

since we're not even gonna be there.

Truth is
the whole area is being redeveloped.

You know what you sound like, Mom?
You sound like a realtor.

That's because I <i>am</i> a realtor.

Wait, so where are we gonna watch
the fireworks on the Fourth of July?

No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.
You guys are not selling.

I gotta go with Lee on this one.

This house has been in our family
for, like, 80 years.

You can't just get rid of it like that.

Is this a vote? Because I vote "no."

I'm sorry, guys.

It's been decided.

[sighs]
[cell phone vibrating]

I'll be right back.

Hello?
[exhales]

<i>Miss Evans, this is Don Washington
from UC Berkeley's admissions.</i>

<i>I'm following up
on your decision regarding Berkeley.</i>

Uh, yes. Hi.

Um, is there any way
I could just get another small extension?

<i>I'm very sorry, Miss Evans,</i>

<i>but we need your decision
by end of business day tomorrow.</i>

<i>from it any longer.</i>

Uh, okay. I understand.

Thank you.
[Don] <i>All right.</i>

<i>I had to pick a school</i>

<i>and make one
of my two favorite peopleÂ very unhappy.</i>

I'ma hit you with a "draw four,"
"draw two." Uno, Uno out.

[Mr. Evans] Oh, no!
What? Gosh!

Let's go.Â [grunts]

Did he cheat?
[Brad] Unh-unh.

[laughing]
Aww. I miss this.

I feel like I barely see you guys anymore.

Yeah, I know.

They're keeping you busy at work.
Very busy.

But don't worry,
I'm still good to babysit tomorrow.

Do you think you're gonna be working
a lot of weekends with this new job?

Uh, yeah, looks that way.

Uh, but I'm not working tomorrow night.

I got a date.


Really?
Yeah.

Um, how many dates have you been on
with this mystery person?

A few. Her name is Linda.

Interesting.

Well, obviously, we,

Brad, are gonna have
to give you a curfew, young man.

Okay. Understood, ma'am.
[both laugh]

<i>we all drove down to the beach house</i>

<i>to do something
I never thought I'd have to do.</i>

<i>Help the Flynns get ready to sell it.</i>

["Welcome Home, Son"
by Radical Face playing]

<i>I had spent literally every summer
of my childhood</i>

<i>hanging out here with Lee and Noah.</i>

<i>And the idea this would be

<i>gonna miss this old place</i>

<i>in ways I hadn't even realized yet.</i>

<i>â™ª â€¦things I've never done â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Welcome home â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Ships are launching

[laughing]
[Rachel] Oh.


I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, don't worry about it.

It's always been like that.

Oh.
Oh, man.

This is funny. Elle and I,
we used to pretend this was a diamond.

[laughs]
And we would, like, pretend to steal it.

It was like this big jewel heist.

<i>â™ª I don't need them anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've come home â™ª</i>


Look how young we all were.

all that long ago to me.

You should keep that one.
Mom would like that.

Maybe I will.

Hey, we were thinking
about ordering a pizza.

Does that sound good?
Yes, absolutely.

In the meantime, could you get started
packing up the rumpus room?

[Elle exhales]
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

Yes.
Yeah, all right.



Whoa!
[toy squeaks]

Here's what we should do.

We need to make one pile
for the stuff we wanna keep

and then another pile for things
we wanna put in bags and donate.

<i>- </i>[rock music playing]
<i>- â™ª It's time to workâ€¦ â™ª</i>


[blows]
[grunts]

Yep.

That is your hand.Â [shouts]

Nope.
[Lee] Yep.


[spits]
[laughing]

Oh, you cheater!
Oh!

[shouting]
[laughing]

[Elle] Well, that was productive.
[laughing]

Wait. Oh, my God!
I just remembered something.

Oh, my God. It's still here!
[gasps] Our Mario Kart lunch box!


What?! Oh, myâ€¦

No!

Wait. Is that what I think it is?

It's our beach bucket list!
What?

Oh, my God!

<i>A long time ago,</i>

<i>Lee and I put together a list of all
the crazy things we wanted to do together</i>

<i>before going to college.</i>

<i>It was all of our childhood
summertime dreams and fantasies</i>

<i>listed out
on one very important piece of paper.</i>

Damn. We put together a solid list.
<i>- </i>Yeah, we did.

We could get arrested for that one.
[laughing]

Uh, yeah, no, uh, we actually could.
Wow!

So, how long does it usually take
to sell a house out here?

Well, we have to put it on the market,

but, you know, maybe two or three months.

That's gonna be a real hassle
running out here all the time, though.

What do you mean?

Well, we have to meet with the appraisers,

surveyors, contractors
and the people looking to buy the place.

Well, gee,
that does sound like a real hassle.

Yeah, especially, you know,
with all the road work that's coming up.

I mean that traffic on the freeway,
back and forth andÂ back and forth

and back and forth.


And constantly driving up
to check on the work that's being done.

Okay, what are you kids getting at?

I am so glad that you asked,
dear parent of mine.

Since this is our last summer here
at the beach house,

and since, like you said,

you're gonna need someone here,
help coordinating some stuff.

We would be more than happy
to stay here for you.

But we would take
amazing care of the place.

So, what do you say?

We'll talk about it.
[gasps] That's a yes! Ha ha ha!

Not so fast. Deal isn't closed yet.

Guys.

Umâ€¦

Come on.

Okay.
Yes! Yes!


But this place needs
to beÂ absolutely spotless.

I mean it.
Well, yeah, yeah. Of course.

It shall be done.
Your wish is our command.

[Mrs. Flynn] Okay.
[Lee] I love you.

Have I told you told that recently?
I'll be right back.

We got you, Ma.Â You're the best.

[beeps]
[exhales]



Hi. Uh, this is Elle Evans. I'm...

Yeah, yeah, that's right.

Yeah, I'm just calling to let you know
that I've... I've made a decision.


Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

Yeah.
Okay.

What's going on?

I got off the wait-list.


Harvard.

What? Ha ha!
Ooh!


Wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.
Put me down. Put me down.

Oh, shit.

Crap.

Hang on.

Lee!

Lee!

Lee, can we please talk?

What's there to talk about? You know,
this is just the way things go, right?

No, what... what do you mean?

It's just the way the world works,
you know.Â Friends leave. They grow apart.

We are...
We're gonna talk everyÂ single day,

and I will see you on holidays.

No, because I'm gonna...
Gonna beÂ with Rachel on holidays.

Okay, yeah, that's... that's fine.

But like you told her,
we're gonna make it work too.

And come on, dude. We just...
We landed a beach house, right?

We can make this summer a blast.

I promise.
Yeah.

Kind of like you promised
about rule number 19?

That is not fair.

I can't just
not be upset about this, Elle.

Okay, you're leaving me.

<i>about hiding all this from Lee.</i>

<i>But the truth was I was leaving him,</i>

<i>no matter how much I wanted
to be at Berkeley with him too.</i>

<i>And it was killing me to see him so upset.</i>

<i>All I wanted to do</i>

<i>was show him how much he meant to me.</i>

Lee,

I don't know what's gonna happen.

But what I do know
is that no matter where we are,

you're always gonna be my best friend.

And I just happen

to be holding some list

that says
we could make thisÂ our best summer yet.

So, you're sayingâ€¦

that we do this whole list this summer.

Our best summer we've ever had.

The best summer <i>ever</i>. Period.

I promise.

I mean, rule number 18.

{\an8}[sighs] Yeah.

{\an8}You got into Harvard.

{\an8}I got into freaking Harvard. [chuckles]


Congratulations.



<i>And I was gonna make it count.</i>

The whole summer?

I promise I can still be here
whenever you need me to babysit,

so you could hang out
with, you know, uh, what's-her-name.

Linda.
<i>- </i>Right. Linda.

But seriously, Dad,
I'll take care of everything, okay?

Things will be handled, all right?

Milk will be bought,
soccer will be played.

All chores will be done. I swear.


Brad has to be picked up
from soccer on Thursdays.

I'm on call every other weekend.

So, is that a yes?

That is a yes, Ellie-bear.
[shouts]

Yes! Thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

[Lee] But there's sand everywhere.
Oh, sweet boy.

Hey, Elle.
Yeah.

So I have you working a double today.

And then I put you down
for those extra shifts you wanted.

Extra shifts?
Mm-hmm.

Uh, okay.

Is there a problem?

No, no, it's no problem. Thanks, May.

Thank you.
Okay.




[Lee mutters] Shh!

Dude! [chuckles]
Are you kidding? I just wanna help.

You know, we're not gonna be able
to do all of our bucket list items.

{\an8}[Elle] <i>Bucket list item number 22.</i>

{\an8}<i>Live together at Berkeley.</i>

{\an8}[sighs] <i>This one was gonna be tricky.</i>

{\an8}Hey, umâ€¦

I've been thinking.
And what if I just went up with you now?

Yeah, we go up to Berkeley.
We'll find an apartment, get set up.

It'll be like we're moving in together

without the actual,
you know, moving in part.

Hmm.

I accept your offer.
Ooh, yay!

Hi, guys. Sorry about the wait. I...

Elle?
Oh, my God.

[chuckles]
Uh, hi.

[splutters] How are you?
[chuckles]

Oh, my God. It's so good to see you.
Elle, nice to see you.

Hey.
Hi.

Um, I haven't seen you since graduation.

W-what are you doing here?

Well, we were hungry.

That makes sense.
You are here, and you are hungry.

What can I get you?Â Do you wanna go first?

I've got some recommendations for you.

Hey.
Hey.

Sorry for the weirdness earlier.


I hope things can be cool for us,

since we'll probably run into each other
around here.

Of course it can. Yeah.

Um, are you hanging out
at the beach this summer?

Yeah, I just got a job lifeguarding
at the water park.

Oh, cool. Wait, wait, wait. Is that
the one with the giant go-kart track?

That is the one.

Interesting.

Um, questionâ€¦

[cell phone rings]

Hey.

Hey, loser. What you up to?

[clicks tongue]
Uh, just doing some apartment hunting.

Good. Your last place smelled
like weird old cheese. [laughs]

<i>Okay, so listen.</i>

The fam are gonna be
in LA earlier than I thought.

Oh, that's great.
You should come by our place for a bit.

<i>Come crash if you want.</i>
Are you sure Elle won't mind?

Maybe you should ask her first.

No, it's okay.
We're in a pretty good place right now.

<i>I think it'll be good.</i>

Cool, cool, cool. You think
you can pick me up when I get in?

Yeah, of course.
<i>Perfect. I'll text you the address.</i>

Okay, bye.



That's why it's so funny.

Actually, um, you rushed out of the house
so... so quickly this afternoon.

I didn't...
I didn't get a chance to ask you. I...

I'm sorry.
I've had, like, a million things going on.

But, um, ask me what?

Well, Chloe's actually gonna be in town,

and I told her it would maybe be cool if
she wanted to stay at our place for a bit.

Is that okay with you?

Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, absolutely.

As far as I'm concerned,
that is... that's ancient history.

And she can come
with usÂ to the... the water park.

What's the water park?

Okay, so, totally random.

I ran into Marco and his family
eating at the restaurant,

and he actually has a job
at the water park.

So he's gonna help us
with this cool bucket list thingy.

Oh, cool. Marco.

Wait, that's...

That's kind of a double standard.
I was totally fine with Chloe.

Well, I didn't kiss Chloe.

I didn't mean for that
to come outÂ the way that it did.

I'm... I'm really sorry.

It's okay.

Let's just drop it, okay?

Okay, it's dropped. [chuckles]


[chattering]
[laughing]

[Noah] I'm bored.
[both laugh]

So you'll... you'll come to the water park?

Yeah, yeah, I'll come.
Okay.

And since you're going,

you can help Lee and I
with a bucket list item.

Oh, God. What... what is it?

What is the bucket list item?

It's amazing.
[chuckles] No.

I'll let Lee fill you in.
No.

And that's our epic plan for race day.

So, will you help us?

Absolutely not.

Why the hell not?
Look, Lee, I'm not gonna wear a costume.

I'll go, be there for Elleâ€¦

little mission is that you got going,

but, uh, that is it.


You know, if you spent less time
worrying about your bucket list,

you might be able
to getÂ that taillight fixed.

I like it busted! And screw you!

What?

Did you really expect him to do it?

Well, yeah, I thought that, you know,
maybe this time he would actually...

[sighs] No, no, not really.
[chuckles]

Well, hey, anyway,

I just wanna let you know how much fun
it is having you here while I'm working.

But I do have one question.
What's that?

What does a girl gotta do
to get water on table 17?

Chop, chop!
Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.

[laughing]
Hey, Lee.


You ready to go?
[Lee] Definitely.

Ready to go where?

I, uh, invited Ashton
to go to the, uh, the comic book show.

Cool.

You didn't wanna go to that, did you?
I could stay here if you need me to.

No, no. Gosh, no. I... I gotta...


I catch you later?
Catch you later!

<i>Was I a total hypocrite or what?</i>

Bye. Have fun.

<i>This was my fault, after all.</i>

<i>I was the one leaving Lee.</i>

<i>But even though I wanted
to be with Noah so badly,</i>

<i>I couldn't help wondering
if I should've chosen Berkeley</i>

<i>with Lee instead.</i>

Hey! What are you doing here?
Hey!

Wanted to stop by and say I got everything
set up for you at the water park.

No way! Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
[chuckles]

No worries.

Is Noah helping out too?


We couldn't get him to wear the costume,
but he'll be there.

Is he gonna have any problem
with me being there?

No, no, no.
It'll be totally fine. Don't worry.

[gasps] I think I'll go get my stuff.
Great!

Awesome.
Do you want some nachos before we go?

[Brad] No, Linda already made me some.
Linda?


[Linda] So sorry.
That's okay.


[Elle] No, no, I got it. I got it.
Oh.

[Elle] Okay.
Okay.

Well, uh, wine disaster aside,
I'm really glad to meet you.

Uh, yeah. You too.

I'm really glad you're here.

Your dad and I were wondering
if you could have dinner with us soon.

Um, you know, I would love to,

but the restaurant has
me workingÂ such crazy hours lately.

Um, I... I think
I'm gonna have toÂ pass on that.

Okay.

Well, your mom was an old friend of mine.

It'd be nice to talk about her with you,
but maybe we could do something else.

Yeah, maybe. Um, I... I...

But I'm... I'm kind of in a rush,
so I gotta get going.

It was nice to meet you.

No, you too.

Uh, Brad, I'll be in the car.

Bye.
Bye.

[Chloe] Come on, come on, come on.
[Elle] Chloe!

Seriously?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

This is ridiculous. No, no, no, no!
[laughs] I'm in.

Aww. No!
I'm sorry.

Wow!
[both laugh]

Well, remind me never to play you again.
[laughs] Oh!

Maybe you
should have skipped this college thing.

You know, go pro.

Oh, my gosh.
I'm not that good, but thank you.

[Brad and Noah chattering, laughing]

[Chloe laughs]
[both shout]

Oh, my God. Your brother is adorable.

Yeah, he's pretty cool.

Yeah, just, um, babysitting,
'cause my dad is on a dateâ€¦

Okay.

â€¦with his new, uh, girlfriend or whatever
he's calling her. I don't know.

I just met her. She's kind of annoying.

No.
Yeah.

[both laugh]

Well, if it makes you feel any better,

all my friends hate
their dad's girlfriends.

Oh, well, I don't really, like...
I don't really hate her.

Don't worry about it, okay?
I promise you, it's pretty standard.

they were dressed up like us.

What's great was all the looks
were out of pure jealousy.

They wished they looked as cool as us.
Yeah, yeah.

Where have you been?

When was the last time
you checked your phone?

Why? Didn't you go
to the... the comic book thingy?

[both chuckle] She called it a thingy.

I got this.
All right.

So, yeah, we did end up going
to the comic book <i>show.</i>

But then after that,
we went upÂ to meet with our friend Elle

{\an8}for bucket list item number 18.

{\an8}'80s mini-golf night.

{\an8}Oh, my God! No.

Yes! And it was spectacular.
Out of this world.

[Lee] And Ashton got three holes in one.
That's cool.

No. I... I justâ€¦

Anyway, I'm really sorry, Lee.

Are you mad at me?

No, as long
as we're still good for tomorrow.

Yeah, come on. Prepped and ready to go.
Cool. Also, Ashton's gonna come too.

It's so stupid.
I told her I'm not doing it.


Yes.
Sometimes you gotta support your lady.

I am. I'm here. I'm supporting her.

That's if she ever shows up.


[rock music playing]
<i>- â™ª Yeah! â™ª</i>

She definitely showed up.

Hey, can you hold this for a sec?

Yeah.

Close one.

Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's okay.

Come on.

Don't be mad just 'cause you lost.
You know what I keep thinking about?

Why the guy that you kissed
in front of the whole world

is wearing the costume
that you asked me to wear.

Noah! You blow things out of proportion.
Why's he wearing it?

It's very clear
that he's still after you...

He's not. There's nothing
going on between Marco and me.

If you think that he's not
still after you, thenÂ you're being naive.

It's embarrassing.

It's embarrassing.

God. I'll see you at the house.

Hey, thank you so much again for today.
It was amazing.

Of course. Any time.

You're the best.


You know what?

I don't even care.
What we just did was legendary.

I don't know.
I sort of think he might have a point.

What?

Listen, I just don't think
I would be too happy

if Rachel started hanging out
with an ex of hers all the time, you know?

Okay. First off, he's not my ex, Lee.

And second,
it takes two people to do something.

Which means Noah doesn't trust me.

It's him that I don't trust.

I mean,
he clearly still has feelings for her. Soâ€¦

Look, if you trust her, then you gotta
believe what she says and nothing less.

[cell phone chimes]

Is everything okay?

Uh, yeah. It's just...
Just stuff with my parents.

What's going on?

It's nothing.

My dad just told me that him and my mom
are getting a divorce,

and now they won't stop calling
to check up on me.

Oh, I'm sorry.
No, please.

Just don't make a big deal about it, okay?


[Elle and Lee chattering]

Third time's the charm.
Third time.


It's always the third time.
What's that about?

What is that?


What?

No way.

I cannot believe
they're getting rid of our <i>DDM </i>machine.

Wait. The <i>DDM </i>machine.

What are you doing?

I'm adding a final item to our list.

The last <i>DDM </i>dance on our machine.

July 5th. You'll be there, right?

<i>if it was the fight with Noah</i>

<i>or that everyone seemed
to be coming at me at once,</i>

<i>but I was starting to feel overwhelmed.</i>

What? You don't wanna do it?
Of course I wanna do it.

But we literally have one month left
to finish the entire bucket list,

and then we leave for school.

Yeah.

I get it.

You got your hands full. It's okay.

[Elle] <i>But just like Leeâ€¦</i>
[sighs]

Lee, hold on please.

I'll be there<i>.</i>

<i>â€¦I wasn't ready to let go yet either.</i>

Okay. Thanks.

And we're still on for tonight?
All right, we put a lot of work in it.

So we can't be late.
Yeah, no, don't worry. I won't be late.

[slow-tempo rock music playing]

<i>â™ª Where did you come from? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You're no strangerâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Noah, you did all of this?

I wanted to make up for yesterday.

This looks amazing.

I thought you could use a night in.
You deserve it.

What's wrong?

Well, there's thisâ€¦

God. I have this thing with Lee, and it's
like we've been planning it for weeks...

Please don't tell me
it's a bucket list thing.

I'm sorry. I feel horrible.

You're actually gonna go?
I mean, I made you dinner.

I did this for you, and you're leaving?
No, it's not like I wanna go.

Listen, we're gonna be
in Boston together all next year.

I just feel like
I'm leaving him all alone.

Me asking you to come to Boston

isn't some, like, evil plot
to make you leave Lee behind.

No, I... I'm not...
That's not what I'm saying at all.

Listen, I'm gonna be back
in an hour, okay? I swear.

Fine. Do whatever you want.

Noah. I... [sighs]

I couldn't find you anywhere.

I'm right here.

Well, yeah,
but I was supposed to come get you.

Hey, Elle. I wasn't expecting you.
Can I get you a plate?

What?

No, no, I'm here because I was supposed
to get Brad, and I couldn't find him.

Oh, Elle, I'm so sorry.

Your dad told me how busy you were,
and I offered to pick up Brad.

Oh, didn't he text you?

No, he didn't.Â [huffs]

What I would like, though,
is for you to contact me directly

if plans change.

I really am sorry.

But with you working
and grocery shopping and watching Brad,

I just felt like you might need a hand.

Well, you were wrong.

I guess once we moved in together,
everything kind of fell apart.

Wait. So what, you're just gonna give up?

I'm not giving up.

I'm just tired of fighting.

Well, then do something about it.

Like talk to her or fight for her.
Anything. God!

You're really sweet.

No, I'm not going anywhere.
What's going on?

They just want out.

Great.

So what are you doing
for the Fourth of July?

So I was cleaning out our room,
and then it just fell out of her bag.

So what did you find?

She had an acceptance letter to Berkeley.

Which means that she was never
on the wait-list.

Wow!
I guess she found out, like, in May.

Well, I guess that that does show how much
she wants to be with you in Boston.

Yeah, yeah, I guess.

So, look what I got us.

Oh, my God! Lee, how did you get these?

Wait.

These are for the concert on the 22nd.

We're both in college orientation then.

Yeah, I figure we could skip orientation

She never will be.

to even be doing it.

Selfish?
Yes.

making sure
that you and Brad are my only priority.

I put that part of my life on hold.

I even took a job that I hate

I mean, I guess.

But you know, I've...
I've just had so much pressure on me, andâ€¦

we really haven't had
any alone time together.


Elle, you and I have been trying so hard.

I know.

Let's say we keep trying.

But this and then in a year's time,
it doesn't work out

and, you know,
you've moved across the country.

You've given up
everything you wantedÂ for me.

but that's for me to decide.

I... I think... I mean, I would think
that I would know what's best for me.

No, you do. You... you do. You definitely
know what's best for you, butâ€¦

I don't wanna be one of the people
who makes you put yourself last.

What does that mean?

Look, Elle, I don't wanna be responsible
for a decision you make

that you're gonna regret.

[scoffs]
Listen, now, you can reapply at Berkeley.

No, you can go to school with Lee
like you wanted.

I just don't wanna be the one
that kept you from being with him.

It's my decision to go to Boston!
I can't be respon...

Why do you think you get
to decide these things for me?

I'm not trying to decide anything...


Look, I know better than trying
to stop you going to Boston.


But if you do decide to goâ€¦


â€¦it's not gonna be with me.

So, that's it?

The fact that we love each other
means nothing?Â [sobbing]

I do love you,

but maybe sometimes loving each other
just isn't enough.

[continues sobbing]

Are you sure this is what you want?

Yeah.

<i>â™ª Baby, now â™ª</i>

Leeâ€¦

I'm so sorry.

Somehow I'll make this up to you.

That is what this entire summer was about.

Making it up to me.

Well, forget it.

I don't need it.

Please don't do this.

Elle, I have nothing more
to say to you right now.

You know that I wanted to be there.

It's just this...
This thing happened with Noah.

You seriously cannot be this upset.
It is just a game, Lee.

Is that really
what you thinkÂ this is about?

The game? What, do you think I'm five?

It's not just about the damn game, Elle.

It's about you fighting
for our friendship.

Lee, I know you're upset, but this is...

And I don't matter to you, really.

Not compared to him. I never have!


You know what?

God. It's like you are five.

You have never had
to worry about anything.

You've had everything handed
to you your whole life.

And now,
you accuse me of not caring about you?

You know, everything that I've done
this summer, everything,

for you and for everybody,
just probably proves that I care too much.

This was supposed
to be our best summer ever.

But it was never gonna be

because all of those things that just made
our summer so great before, that's gone,

and we're never gonna get that back.

But you know what? Maybe that's the point.

Maybe we're not supposed to.

At least those of us who have
to grow up at some point.

Oh. Oh, and... and new rule.

Yeah, all of our rules are done.

Morning.

Hey.

I'm gonna head out,
so I just wanted to say goodbye.

How are you?

[sighs] I don't know if you heard, but...
Noah called me.


Things definitely didn't turn out
how I expected.

No, for him either.

But there is one thing I know,

and that is that whether he was ready
for this relationship or not,

he really does love you.

Guess loving each other
isn't always enough.

Maybe not.

Sometimes the timing just isn't right.

You take care of yourself.

You too.

For whatever it's worthâ€¦

I want you to know

that I think
you are an absolutely brilliant woman.

Thank you, Chloe.

[slow-tempo rock music playing]

[door opens]

Lee. Noah.

No, it's just me.

Oh, hey, uhâ€¦
[Mrs. Flynn] Hey.

I didn't know you were coming today.

I could've taken care
of whatever you needed.

No, no, no, it's fine.

I have to meet
with the environmental engineers anyway.

They have to approve
any shoreline demolition.

Wait. They're tearing the house down?

Putting in condos. [sighs]

is just getting worse and worse.


Lee told me everything last night.

[clicks tongue] Yeah.

are pretty much done too.

Elle, can I talk to you about something?

Yeah.

Other than Noah,

why did you wanna go to Harvard?

What do you mean? It's Harvard.
Yeah.

Why wouldn't I wanna go there?
True.

It's just that the whole time
I've heard you talking

about where you
were goingÂ to go to school,

I never once heard you talk

about what you actually wanted
to study once you got there.

Yeah, I mean, like, lots of people
figure outÂ what they wanna study

once they start
going to a college,Â though.

I know.

But did you ever stop
to think that maybe your choice of school

had more to do
with what other people wanted for you

rather than what you wanted for yourself?

Maybe it's time that you think
about what it is that <i>you</i> want to do.

Figure out what your dream is,
what you're passionate about

and then choose a school based on that.

And not let anyone
or anything change that.

Thank you.

Come here.

Now you just have to figure out
what you're passionate about.

Is that all?
[chuckles]



Hey, I'm glad you're here.

Uh, what do you think
about this idea I'm working on?

It's beautiful.

Thank you.

Hey, Lee, can we talk?

Uh, yeah, what's up?

Elle and Noah broke up.

What?

You talked to her?
Yeah.

You should really call her.

She doesn't wanna hear from me.

Not after what I said to her.

Well, everything that's happened
with Elle and Noah

got me thinking about us.

You know, I've watched them trying

to keep up
their long-distance relationship,

and I saw how hard it was.

Rachel.

If I did something, I swear I can fix it.
Lee, no, no. It's not you.

School is gonna be really tough
for both of us.

And I just don't think
that we should make it harder

by trying to make a relationship work
from so far apart.

So you're breaking up with me?

You mean so much to me,

and I just don't want
to see us end up like they did.

And who knows? Maybe...
Maybe if we're meant to be together,

we'll find our way back to each other.


I love you too. [sobbing]




I don't mean to, butâ€¦

â€¦I screw up a lot.

And you've done so much for me.

I would never want you to be unhappy.

And I had no right
to stand in the way of you and Linda.

[voice cracks]
I don't want you to be disappointed in me.

[sniffles, exhales]

I'm not disappointed in you, Elle.


We all make mistakes.

It's what you do after
that shows who you are.

Hey.
Hi, Linda.

What are you doing here?

Lindaâ€¦

â€¦I really just wanted to apologize
for my behavior the other night.

The Scottie dog piece,

it means a lot to me because that
was the piece that my mom always picked

when we would play <i>Monopoly </i>together.

And it was...

Yeah, I know that sounds stupid.
It just... that's...

No, it doesn't sound stupid at all.

I understand.

Thank you.

Elleâ€¦

â€¦I would never dream
of tryingÂ to replace your mother,

but I did care about her a lot,
and I have some stories that I'd love

to share with you
if you wanna hear them. [chuckles]

I would love that.

I'll see you later.
Okay.

Bye.

that he might actually be there.</i>


I have a feeling it's not me.

But like you saidâ€¦

â€¦I'm not the one.

Well, apparently, neither is Noah. Soâ€¦

I'm sorry.

But I'm glad we got a chance
to say goodbye before I go.

Finally pick a school?
No.

Gap year. I'm going to New York.

I wanna try to work as a musician there.

Wait, really?

You never told me you wanted
to go to New York.

I've always wanted to go.

But besides my family, there was
only one thing keeping me in LA, andâ€¦

and that's all over now.

Well, good luck. You're gonna kill it.

Thanks.

It's my new moonshot.

Well, goodbye, Elle Evans.

So you got accepted to Berkeley?

Yeah.

Why are you showing me this now?

Because that's what I should have done
in the first place.

You were right.

You should've told me.

And you would've been okay with that?

No, probably not.

See? This is what I mean. I...

It took me hurting both of you

to finally realize what the problem was.

I justâ€¦ I care about you both so much

that I've spent my life,

you know,
doing what's best for our relationships,

but I haven't really gotten
to spend much time figuring out

what would make me happy.

What are you saying,
that I don't care about your happiness?

No, no! It's not... it's not really
about anything that you did.

It's holding something back
so that I wouldn't hurt you,

even if it hurt me.

You know?

I just really have to stop doing that.

I, uh, I heard about you and Noah.

Yeah.

So then come to Berkeley with me.
It's worth a shot.

This is what I'm talking about, though.

I chose Boston to be with Noah
and Berkeley to be with you.

But I gotta figure out who I am.

On my own.

Come here.

I'm really sorry
about what I said at the arcade.

I didn't mean it.

Yeah, you did.

That's okay.

A lot of it was true.

Then I am sorry we didn't make this
our most memorable summer ever.

I don't know.
That may be exactly what we did.


So, um, you know where you wanna go?

I think so.



I...
[woman] Miss Evans.

What a surprise.

You remember me?

You won the only dance competition
I have ever judged.

So safe to say, "Yeah, I remember you."
[both laugh]

What can I do for you?


Mom said you were taking off.

Yeah, that's the plan. [sighs]

You knew she got accepted into Berkeley,
didn't you?

What are you talking about?

You ended things with Elle,
so that she wouldn't miss the chance

of going to college with me
like we'd always planned.

You know, there were a lot of reasons
Elle and I broke up.

I didn't want her
to make a decision she was gonna regret.

You know,
but just 'cause we're not dating anymore

doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop protecting her.

So, is she gonna go to Berkeley, orâ€¦

No, actually.
She, uh, she's applying to USC.

She wants to do video game design.
[chuckles]

All right.

Yeah, that sounds about right.

Yeah.

Hey.

I'm not sure if it's my place
to say this or not,

but that thing you said earlier
about always needing to protect Elle.

It's not true.

She's always been able
to take care of herself.

The only thing she ever really needed
from you wasâ€¦

was for you to love her.

Anywayâ€¦

I'll be seeing you, brother.

Yeah, of course, totally, definitely.

Oh, you mean, like, right now?

I'm so sorry. I didn't know that
I was supposed to prepare that for today.

It doesn't have to be anything formal.
Just a sharing of concepts.

Right, of course. Umâ€¦


I...

Oh, my God. Um, I'm so sorry. There's...

Nothing's coming to my mind.
I just... I don't know what to say.

Look, it's not a problem, Elle.

Uh, actually,
I... I think we have everything we need.

Thank you.
[man 2] Thank you.

Yeah, thank you.

I... I did have one idea.

But it's... I mean,
it's really just more of a basic concept.

Go ahead, Elle.

Umâ€¦

You know how in fantasy sports,
people draft real-world sports athletes,

and the players' performances are used
to determine the success of...

I think we're all aware
of how fantasy football works, Miss Evans.


Um, of course. [clears throat]

What if we were to apply that
to a large e-sports platform?

Players could get together
at the beginning of the season

and take turns drafting
their favorite pro players.

And you could even call it
"Fantas-E Sports."

And fantasy football's, like,
a multimillion-dollar industry, right?

It's $7 billion actually.

See? There you go.

And how much
is the e-sports industryÂ raking in?

Uh, two billion.

So, I mean, it kind of seems
like that might be worth something.

Oh, and I also have this other ideaâ€¦

Yeah, yeah.

I'm designing games. It's great.

I work at a really small company.

Okay.

And I have a lot of creative freedom,

I would like that. That sounds fun.

Great.

Well, I've gotta...
I gotta go see some friends,

and then I've got an early flight, soâ€¦

No, of course. No worries.
But, no, I'll call you, okay?

Sure. Yeah, if you've got time.

Uh, yeah.
Sorry about that, May. Good talk. [laughs]

Oh, yeah.

Oh, my heart is beating so fast.


That is just fine.



Best line of the movie.

[Noah] I'm gonna fall!
I'm gonna... [bleeps]


Whoa! Shit. My bad.
Shouldn't have said "shit."

Ooh! That was weak, mate.

That was so weak.
Come on, give it to me.

Holy shit!
[man laughs]

This is [bleeps] nuts!
[laughing]

[shouts]
[whirring]


You told me to walk away, right?

[laughing off-camera]

We've been dancing on this machine
since we could walk.

What do you want me to do?

[electronic humming]

I want that [bleeps] machine
to stop making noise.


I think my feet still smell
from yesterday.

Very nice.

[man] Hey, Vince.
[man 2] Oh, good job, man. Thank you.

Well, that's his. You shouldn't
be keeping track of that. [laughs]

Taylor!

Let me just go get us another snack.
Oh, okay. Is Marco here?

Hey! Come on, come on, come on!
Really, man?

What are you doing here?

[laughs]

That guy is reckless.
[laughing]

Eight ball.
Nope. Nope.

[chuckles]
[Noah chuckles] Come on.


What is happening?
I had a script sitting right here.


[both speaking gibberish]
[Lee] Yeah, yeah, okay.

Wanna play some hoop ball?

Oh, myâ€¦ [chuckles]

Like a boss!
[laughs]

Get in there! [grunts]

[shoes squeak]

[belches, laughs] Holy shit!

That's gross. [chuckles]



Really, Harvard?
Yes.

Harvard. Shit.
[laughing]


[both laughing]
I'm sorry.

Absolutely no order!

[splashing]
[laughing]




You are buying me a new apple. I swear.

I can't even handle you

[continues laughing]
We're over. We're done. We're through.

[laughs]
That was so stupid.
