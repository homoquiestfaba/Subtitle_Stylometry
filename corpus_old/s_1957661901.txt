my daughter to the prom or not?

Me? [Chuckles]

What? No, I don't know

You drive here every morning

You think I'm an idiot?
No, sir.

It's really hard to find the right time.
And what about Blaine?


Oh my God, Seth, did you Fatone your hair?

It looks so good!

Dad, you didn't have to cook breakfast.

You're about to graduate.

We're not gonna have too many more
of these breakfast opportunities.

Yeah.
Grateful to be included, sir.

It's gorgeous.

You know, Dad, um,

I saw at the mall

Looked pretty jumping.

You're a catch, Mr. Conway.
A sad woman would totally go out with you.

I'll tell you what, I'll ask somebody out

Tiffany went behind my back

and got the Activities Committee

to make the prom king and queen song

Uh, no. You know, that piece of gossip
hasn't really trickled down to me yet.

She knows I want a classic,

Your forehead's bleeding.

Oh.

Sure you're okay?

Oh, yeah, I'm good.

I know it's a long shot, but...

Seth, you don't even have
to finish the question.

The answer's yes.
Wait, really? What about Blaine?

Ah, he'll understand. It wouldn't feel
right to spend prom without you.

Seth,

I would love for you to come
to my after-prom party.

Oh, wow. Yeah, cool. [Chuckles]

Thanks, Steph.
Oh my God. Duh, no prob.

Oh, also, there's gonna be a VIP room,

I mean it.

Fun. [Chuckles]

Okay, um, I'm gonna let you out here

Yeah?

Let me give you a little something
to remember me by. Boop, boop!

That's so embarrassing.

Oh my God, he's so into me. What?

Oh my God. Did anyone see that? Bye.

Ew. He shouldn't do that to you.

That's what couples do.

When you get a boyfriend,
you'll understand.

Yeah, I'll pass.

Don't lose these. I'm serious.

If my parents find out I gave you
the keys to our lake house for a party,

they'll ship me off to a convent

My grandfather built that with his hands.

If anything happens...

Oh my God, I promise you have nothing
to worry about. You're the best.

Thank you so much, Marth.
You know you're invited, right?

Did you just invite me
to a party that's at my own house?

Of course not.
I'm inviting you to the VIP section.

Seth will be there too.
So you'll have someone to talk to.

Right. I could also talk to you.


Um, except I'm probably gonna be losing
my bottom half virginity to Blaine.

So I'll be, like, in and out.

So will Blaine, literally.
You know what I mean?

Also, Martha, it's pep rally day.
Why aren't you in your cheer uniform?



You look so hot right now.

You look so great.
Okay. Yeah.

Okay. I'll see you later. Bye!

So, I've been telling everyone
about the VIP section at our party,

but here's a little secret.

There's gonna be
a VIP VIP section just for us.

Mmm, so, uh, about that,

um, most of the football team's already
said yes to going to a different party.

But this one has
a heated pool and a live band.

What? Whose party?

Tiff's. But we could bone there,

I won cheer captain fair and square,

when we got together. I don't cheat.

to be the butt-roids on myâ€¦ butt?

I don't know what you're talking about.

the prom king and queen song.

Now you're throwing an after-prom party

when you know
I've been planning mine for months.

You mean the one you have to throw
at Barfa's family lake house

'cause you live in a shanty.

Her name is Martha,

and she hasn't thrown up on herself
since the eighth grade, soâ€¦

Cancel your party!
[Tiffany] Sorry.

My daddy has already paid
for the caterers.

Open bar, JÃ¤ger,
Mike's Hard Lemonade, Smirnoff Ice.

All the good shit.

So, you cancel yours.

You won't wanna throw a party
after I beat you for prom queen.

you're gonna win?

'Cause I'm MTV, and you're VH1.

I'm the real deal, and you're a poser.

You think you can shimmy your koala ass
to the top of the food chain I created

and screw up my senior year?

You're just a poor spaz playing dress up.

Don't go chasing waterfalls.

Take that back.

[tense music plays]

[door closes]

[Blaine] Freshmen suck!

Freshmen suck!

Freshman suck!

Blaine, settle down. Settle down.

Listen.

We have less than a month of school left.
Let's all just get through it.

Now I know you allâ€¦
[Steph] All right, sluts.

Everybody, listen up.

Listen to Martha.

Just a couple notes
before we get out there.

We replaced the spotlight operators

with kids tall enough
to see what's going on.

Try not to hit the ground too hard
so our CD doesn't skip.

<i>"Our </i>CD"?

I'm sorry, since when does a clipboard
and a windbreaker make you a Bulldogette?

Since I appointed her
equipment manager, Tiffany.

Do you have any idea
how much she does for us?

Without her, we'd fall apart.
Whereas without you, Tiff,

we'd, I don't know,
have less stains on our uniform

from catching your spray-tanned ass.
[girls mumble]

Continue, Marth.

Oh, I was done.

Oh.

All right, biatches. When I started
choreographing this routine,

I knew it had to be more
than just a regular cheer,

which is why I made this,

a step-by-step guide to our routine

so that future squads will be able
to replicate our VMA-level performance.


Martha, please see
that this gets into the school archives

so that our legends will live on.

Do we have a school archive?
We do now.

Oh, hi.

Hi. Hello. Hi.

Excuse me. Um, I'm not sure what happened,

but I think there's been a mistake,
and I've been put in the wrong room

'cause there's a bunch of birthday cards
for, like, a really old person.

And the TV's flat,
like the back of it is missing,

and I really need to see
who's number one on <i>TRL.</i>

Dr. Johnson to the third floor.
The cheerleader just woke up.

Oh, I don't mean to be a bitch,
but "cheer captain."

Cheer captain.

And do you have any Von Dutch jeans?
'Cause this is, like, really unflattering.

Oh crap.

What are you staring at?

Hello? It's very rude to be a stare bear.

Hello? Are you... Stopâ€¦ stop doing that!

Why are you doing that, you freaky old...

[tense music plays]

[loud thump]
[gasps]

And the cheerleader's back down.

Oh, cheer captain. Are you okay?

This defies scientific explanation.

Being this hot?

No.


No way. [Laughs]

Mm-hmm.

Are you sure I haven't been
Freaky Friday'd into some old lady's body?

You've been in a coma
for almost two decades.

That doesn't sound right.

but we'll just take this nice and slow.

It's Martha, Martha Riser. [Chuckles]

I'd have this moment again.

I was this close to freezing you.

What do you mean, Dad?

Don't worry. I couldn't afford it.
I was only gonna freeze your head.

[Martha] No!
[doctor] We'll have to be gentle.

Physically she's aged,
but mentally she's still 17.

Of course. Yes, I see
how we came in a little hot.


Martha, you look like
an<i> Ally McBeal </i>character.

Oh my God. Thank you.

Well, the good news is
nothing abnormal came up in her tests.

Stephanie, your physical
and mental resilience are remarkable.

Uh, letâ€¦ let's go home.

Um, and they give you
a fancy cell phone for that?

Oh, they're common now. Even I have one.

Oh. Okay. [Chuckles]

They do much more than just call people.
You could also watch the news.

Look, here's a news story
about you right now.

What? No. Oh, about me? No, oh my God.
Yeah, it's you!

Okay, wait, show me.

<i>went immediately viral on Instagramâ€¦</i>

Oh my God.
I went down like a bag of dicks.

Oh.

Stephie!
Wait. What does "viral" mean?

Well, "viral" just means everybody saw it.

Everybody's seen that?
I look retarded in those videos.

Now, Steph,
youâ€¦ you cannot say the R-word anymore.

What? Really? Why?
[Martha] Mm-mm.

Because it's offensive
to people with intellectual disabilities.

But what if something
really is, like, "R-word,"

um, what do you call it?
Like, "super gay"?

No, no. You can't call things "gay"
anymore, either,

unless you use it
as a neutral-positive term

to refer to somebody
who identifies as homosexual.

So you cannot say the "R-word."
[Martha] Right.

And, umâ€¦


What was the other word you can't say?
"Gay."

Ha! Made you say it.

[laughing]
[sighs exasperatedly]

Stephie.
I... That'sâ€¦

Still got it, Dad.
You do.

Dad, um, can you take a left up here?

Oh.
To see...

No, no, no. No, um,
actually, you should get home and rest.

Rest? I've been asleep for 20 years.

Dad, just take this left here.
Jim, don't take the left.

Is there... I don't understandâ€¦

Indicator. Indicate left.
Do not. Do not.

[Steph] Thank God, it's still the same.
Yep. There it is. Let's keep going.


Who is that?
[Martha] Umâ€¦

Oh my God.
I know that ass anywhere. That's Blaine.

Wait. Did he get me my dream house?
Stop the car! Why didn't you say anything?

Don't stop the car.
What are you talking about? Stop the car!

Don't stop the car.
No. He's probably sleeping.

He walked into the house.
You don't wanna wake him.

He looked tired!

I don't know what to do. Ah!
Just stop the car!

[screams]
[Martha] No!

[Steph grunts]


Oh. You know what?

Someone from the shelter
already came by yesterday

to pick up our donations, soâ€¦
Thank you though.

Tiffany?

Shut up!

Stephanie?

Oh my God, look at you!
[groans]

I can't believe this.
What is happening?

I have so many things Iâ€¦ I want to say.

I've always felt terrible
about what happened.

I can't believe
you didn't land that stunt.

Wait, why are you living here with Blaine?
I don't get it. [Chuckles]

This is mine and Blaine's dream house, soâ€¦

Well, actually...
Why are you here?

It's a long story.

Our parents got it for us
as a wedding gift andâ€¦

Well, that's it. The end. [Chuckles]

No, you shut your face.

Um, where's Blaine? [Chuckles]
Just get me Blaine, and, um...

I'm so sorry.
He is just so swamped right now with work.

Oh.

I see what you did here.

Get rid of me
so you can steal my dream life.

Ohâ€¦ [chuckles]

Steph.

No, no.
[grumbles]

Look, I know
we never saw eye-to-eye back then,

but you know, the beautiful thing
about time is you move on.


Okay, you know what? I need to go
because I am brining zucchini ribbons,

but I never let a guest leave
without a gift.

Um, so I'm just gonna give youâ€¦

[Steph] What?
Here.

Homemade from my own starter.
A peace offering.

I really look forward
to putting the past behind us.

You know, move past the past.

So, maybe when you're feeling better
and a little bit more stable,

we could do brunch sometime.

Blaine!
It's great to see you!


[video game sound effects play]
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Who's that at the door?

It wasâ€¦ Stephanie Conway.

She's awake?

Ah, yes.

Perfectly preserved.

[scooter honks]
[Jim] And here we are.

Did she not wear her seat belt?


[Martha] Oh God.
[Jim grunts]

It's locked, hon.
Dad!


Hey, Sâ€¦

[Jim chuckles]



[emotional music plays]

Oh my God.

Didn't have the heart to change it.

Kept your Cabriolet too. You know me,
never very good at letting things go.


[both chuckle]

Iâ€¦ I also never, uh, canceled
any of your magazine subscriptions.

Wait, Madonna's now called Lady Gaga?


No.
No.

But she looks exactly like Madonna.
You've had a lot to digest today.

We'll get you caught up this weekend.


Dad. What the F?

Who was in charge of my feeding tube?
My boobs are huge.

Well, youâ€¦ you're just getting older.

You know, bodies change,

and pretty soon,
you'll go through menopause.

Oh my God. Don't.

[Jim sighs]

I can't do this.

[breaths heavily]

I was so close to having my dream life.

You still can, sweetie.

I can't. Look at this.

Well...
[mumbles]

If anyone can do it, it's you.

Oh, Dad, shut up. I'll get it.

for 20 years.


Stephâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦I can't let
an almost 40-year-old woman

into high school.

Yeah, but you heard the doctor.
I'm still 17 mentally.

And lookâ€¦
That's...

â€¦that is medical.
And you cannot argue with science.

Are you sure you're ready to go back?
Yes!

High school was like yesterday for me.
It will not be weird at all.

What else am I supposed to do?

Start an OnlyFans account?
Queef for 20 dollars?

[Martha] What?
That'sâ€¦

I think that's what happens there.

Those aren't your only two options.
You have lots of options.

Lookâ€¦ [splutters] â€¦high school,
it's an intense but delicate ecosystem.

Yeah, which I can handle.

But you know what? There's only a month
of the school year left...

Oh, that's perfect!
That's basically the time that I missed!

Oh, yeah.
Oh, that is, like, fate.

Like, Destiny's Child.


Well, you might be
the first person in history

to use a doctor's note to get into school.

My God! Yes!
[Martha laughs]

Martha! Oh my God.
You're the best. You're the best.

I'm so worried.

<i>â™ª This time I'm gonna be
Everything I want me to be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So fresh, yeah, so free â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'mma get what's coming to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª No diamonds, no rubies â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gonna keep me down
No, I gotta be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So damn high
Yeah, you'll see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'mma be where I wanna be â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hold on tight if you want to ride â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'mma reach new heights
Yeah, let's paint the sky â™ª</i>

Sorry, babe.

I was in a coma.

Miss Conway! Miss Conway! Miss Conway!

[in Australian accent] G'day, mate!

I wanted to say hi in your native tongue.
'Cause you're Australian, right?

Yes. Yeah.
Oh, good, good, good!

Your friend, my boss, Principal Riser,
asked me to show you around

and give you a little orientation
here at Harding.

Oh, okay. I don't really need to.
I know my way around.

Oh, come on, it's fun.
I have nothing else to do.

I'm Mr. Tapper, the guidance counselor,
but you can call me Mr. T.

Is that because youâ€¦ [mimics Mr. T]
â€¦ "pity the fool" who has a bad first day?

Oh. [Chuckles]

Well, yeah. Yeah, I would feelâ€¦
I would feel terrible.

No. I meant, like,
you know, Mr. T. [Chuckles]

[mimics Mr. T]
"I pity the fool. I pity the fool."

I've never said that before, but I guess
I could start if you wanted me to.

I pity the fool!

Mr. T is pitying fools over here.

let'sâ€¦ let's go on a little tour here.

I have your records here from 2002.
You were a cheerleader.

Cheer captain.
Ooh, cheer captain.

Uh, president of the Fashion Club.
Whoa! Your grades were pretty good.

My God, shut up. Don't. I don't want
anybody here to think I'm a dork.

I'm saying
graduating shouldn't be a problem.

Wait. What happened?

Where are
all the prom king and queen winners?

Oh, um, Principal Riser felt
that it sent a bad message,

so she replaced it
with something more positive.

That looks like a bunch of tampons.
Yeah, it is.

But it's also found art.

So you're saying they're found tampons.

Oh, yes, I am.

[cell phone chimes]

[cell phones chiming]

If not, just pretend
it's fake history. [Laughs]

Oh! I am so sorry.

Stephanie?

Oh my God!
Itâ€¦ it'sâ€¦ it's Seth!

Seth?
Yeah!

Oh, Seth!
Oh my goodness!

[Steph] Oh!
Wow!

Martha said that you were back,

and I guess, in my head,
I just couldn't make it real,

but look at you. You look great!

It's me! Like, look,
I'm walking and talking.

Yeah. Doing all those things.
Everything.

Just like you used to, walk and talk.

Well, look at you! Oh my God!

You look so cool and suave and adult.
Yeah. [Chuckles]

Wow! What happened to that nerd
that used to just hang out in the library?

He became the school librarian.

Seriously?

[Seth] Mm-hmm.
Ahâ€¦

Seth, thank you so much for the yearbook.

Why didn't you just come in and say hi?

I didn't wanna overwhelm you, you know.

Plus, I can't stay out so late
on a school night. [Chuckles]

[school bell rings]
Ah, shit. Shoot. [Splutters]

Dang!

I wish I could hang out and talk more,
but I gotta get back to work.

Oh, yeah, I got to get back to class.
[laughs] Yeah.

I don't wanna be
20 years and ten minutes late.

So, I will see you around.
You know where to find me.

Yeah, same.
You know where to find me, in the library.

Some things never change, right?
Bye, Seth. I'll call you.

Or you can do some long division, I guess.

Steph, how's your first day?

Oh my God,
it's just been, like, so amazing.

Like, just making new friends.
Everyone's already obsessed with me.

That's so great. We strive
for a welcoming environment here.

Um, listen, I need to talk to you
about rejoining the Bulldogettes.

Um, instead of cheer, I think
you should be focusing on your schoolwork.

Yeah. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure!

Um, but who do I talk to about rejoining?

Well, you would talk to me.
I'm the cheer coach now.

Okay. Wait, I see your game.

You become principal

so then you can get real power
by running the cheer squad.


Yeah, thatâ€¦ that's not why
I got my master's in education.

Um, look, I don't think the cheer squad

needs a new member right now.

Well, that's wrong
'cause every cheer squad in the country

would love to have me.

There's only two performances left,
so I don't think it's worth it.

Marth, I only need
one performance to make a splash

if I have any chance
of becoming prom queen.

Stephâ€¦
This head still needs a crown.

[Martha chuckles] I'm so sorry.
It's not gonna get it.

Steph,

we do not have
prom queen at this school anymore.

Oh my God, are you having a mini stroke?

What?

Competitions like that, they're dangerous.

Winning things, it justâ€¦
it doesn't reflect our school values.

With no winners, there aren't any losers.

I've made a school with no losers.

But everybody was just talking to me
about how much they want prom queen.

Steph, if all the students want it back,
they know they can petition for it.

But so far no one has.

You were so close.

[girl] Let me put it my mouth.
One more. Ready and oneâ€¦


Oh, hey, is this where the ho-bags sit?

<i>â™ª Ho-ing down with the ho-bags, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hoâ€¦ â™ª</i>
That's a fun way of saying "what's up?"

I'm Janet.
And I'm Yaz, and that's Neil.

I just have to say I'm living
for this little vintage fit.

And I'm not even JK-ing. Okay?
[chuckles]

Okay, what is with
this enormous lunch table?

How are we supposed to know
where the popular kids sit?

Well, when there's just one table,
we're all popular kids.

Everybody.
Oh no, no, no. That's not how life works.

There's only, like, three ways
to become popular,

to be a cheerleader,
to work at Abercrombie,

or to let guys go in the back door.

What?
Oh my God, I must be really popular then.

[chuckles]
What?

Nothing.
Anyways, um, Janetâ€¦


â€¦I was wondering
if you would like to sign my petition.

It's to bring back
prom queen to Harding High.

Oh my gosh!
[gasps] No way!

Do I respect IRL grass root efforts

to effect change
into societal systems? Yes.

It's also very refreshing
to see non-digital campaign strategy.

It is.
So I'll sign it.

I'll sign it too, but don't be surprised
if we're the only ones.

Why's that?

Because nobody's gonna sign this
unless Bri Luvs signs it.

Who?
Her.

Bri Luvs.
That's just her name on social media.

She's got, like,
three million Instagram followers.

And that 98 pounds of sexy is Lance,
her fine-ass boyfriend.

about their open relaish

and called it
the gold standard of the future.

Cool, cool, cool.
So, um, how do I get her to sign it?

Oh, you won't. She's untouchable.

Okay, everyone's friends with her,
but she's friends with no one.

Yeah.

She's coming over here.
No, she's not.

Just act normal. Avoid eye contact and...
Okay.

[gasps] Yaz! Been a minute, huh?
It has been so long.

So long! And Janet, loved your post about
alternative body positivity the other day.

You are so inspiring.

I was just showing off
my new bathing suit.

Hi, I'm Bri, and you must be Stephanie.

I heard about you.

Really? [Chuckles]

I mean, umâ€¦

Yeah, obviously,
because I'm, like, the total shiznit,

and I basically used to be you
when I went here.

You know, the most popular girl in school
'cause we're the same.

I don't really think about popularity.

I'm just trying to build
my most authentic, socially conscious,

body-positive, environmentally aware,
and economically compassionate brand

that's a home for inclusion,
focused fashion, food,

and fun-filled lifestyles.

And if tons of people respond to that,
then, great.

Totally. [Hesitates] Yes.

I mean, obviously.

Um, while I've got you here,
would you mind signing this?

I'm gonna stop you right there.
[sucks teeth]

I made a paper-free pledge this year,
so I only deal with forms digitally.

I'm sure you understand.
But can we take an ussie?

Yes. Absolutely. [Chuckles]

Where to?
[Janet laughs] Umâ€¦ [clears throat]

Where are we going? We're going...
Ooh. What? Sorry.

[camera shutter clicks]
[Bri laughs]

What was that?
[Bri] Oh, before I forget.

My mom, Tiffany,
told me to tell you she says hi.

She said to remind you
she's married to Blaine

and lives in your dream house,
in case you couldn't place her.


Nice meeting you, Stephanie. Bye.

Bye.
Bye.

Baby, you're man spreading again.

Oh. [Chuckles]

Whoops.
[Bri laughs]

Oh my God. He knows you exist.

Yeah, 'cause probably
he's, like, already obsessed with me.

[cell phones chime]
Oh my God. What is that? A fire drill?

[Janet] Uhâ€¦
What, robot invasion?


<i>Hey, guys, we have a new student
at Harding High, and she's older than us.</i>

<i>And I want to remind
everyone around the world</i>

<i>that treating someone different
'cause they're elderly is called ageism,</i>

<i>no matter how weird or foreign
or out of touch they may seem,</i>

<i>and that's not cool.</i>

<i>Also, stay tuned. I have amazing news</i>

<i>about my upcoming summer
screen-detox vacay in Nepal.</i>

<i>Remember, Bri loves you.</i> [kisses]

That was hot.

You're hot.

I'll sign your petition.
Oh my God! Yay! Three people!

Whoo!
Oh my God, no.

Guys, I need
the cheerleaders to sign this.

Because then everyone will.
Cheer pressure.

Well, they'll sign it
'cause we already did.

Ha!

You guys are the cheerleaders?
Absolutely.

[Yaz] Ready?
[cheerleaders] Okay!

<i>â™ª The Earth is smoking â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We need new laws â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Turtles are choking on plastic straws â™ª</i>

Oh. [Chuckles]
Good job, good job. What'd you think?

What was that?

Well, that's...
What was that?

It's our most popular routine. [Chuckles]
Yeah.

Well, who were you guys cheering for?
For everyone.

You know, to do the right thing, right?
Team Humanity!


Uhâ€¦ [chuckles]

But what about, like, the music
and the dancing and the flipping?

Oh. Oh no. No.
We do not do stunts anymore.

Oh.
And also we don't do any sexy dancing.

We'd rather have people listen
to our words than just our bodies.

Okay, yeah, but this cheer
would be so much better

if you guys made me believe you were
seconds away from showing your tits.

[Martha] No, Stephâ€¦
[Steph] Yes, Martha.

[Martha] Okay.
Yes. I had this one signature move.

You'll love it. It's called lips to lips.
Everybody, do it with me.

Don't.
You start on the face.

Fingers go down the body.
[Martha] No.

Down the body and up.

No! Why is everyone doing it?
I'm saying don't do it.

[Yaz] Okay, look.
[Janet] Okay.

We would do that, but our freshman year,
Bri Luvs made an Instagram post

saying that cheerleaders
were anti-feminist.

The whole school turned against us,
and we had to recalibrate.

Her post got, like, seven million likes.

Eight million.
It was for the best.

Anyways, let's show her
our gun control routine.

It's one of our best.
[Steph] No, wait!

What even is this squad? Likeâ€¦

Is there even a cheer captain?

Yeah.
Yeah, Stephanie, I am the cheer captain.

I am the cheer captain.
I am the cheer captain.

I'm a cheer captain. [Chuckles]

And also the coach.
You?

Martha, that's the most fucked up thing
I've ever heard.

Steph, we are all cheer captains here
to promoteâ€¦ Say it with me.


Including you, Steph.
[boy] Welcome.

[pants]
Do you love it? Are you okay?

Oh my God.

[Steph] Oh my God.
She loves it, you guys. You nailed it!

[cheerleaders cheer]
[laughs]

[Yaz] Oh my God!
Aw!

[upbeat music plays and ends]

Excuse me, Mr. Bud.

Hey, what's up?

Um, seeing as you're my librarian now,

you're legally obligated
to help me research something, yeah?

Yeah, by law.

Yeah, I think the teachers union's
a real stickler about that sort of thing.

I'm just kidding.
I'm not in the union. What's up?

[Steph] Oh, this is addictive.
[Seth] Yeah.

Social platforms have become
a vital tool for communication.

Look, it's a turtle humping a rock!

Yeah.
Oh, get it. Get it.

Yeah, oh, that gets a heart.

[phone chimes]
And it's also that.

Okay. All right.
I think I've worked this thing out.

Okay.

So, basically you get followers
by being somebody everybody likes.

Mm-hmm.

So it's a popularity contest,
but instead of just high school,

it's now the whole world,
and the whole world is your phone.

Yeah. I mean, that's exactly it.

That's it.
Yeah, it's pretty sad.

No! This is, like, amazing.
This is like a shortcut.

Wow, I immediately regret
showing you this.

Just to be clear,
this is a way for people to pretend

their life and skin texture
is better than it is.

Is that why you've posted this picture
of you with this random hot chick?

No, that's my ex-fiancÃ©e Diana.

You were engaged?
I was.

Shut up! Seth.
[chuckles] Uh-huh.

That's actually how I ended up here.

We both were working
at the National Archives in DC,

and when we split up, I needed a change.

So Martha got me a job at Harding,
and here I am.

Trust me, being close to 40
and back at my high school

isn't exactly where I wanted to be, butâ€¦

Oh. [Laughs] Tell me about it!
[laughs] Yeah, right!

Uh, well, I should get back
to enriching young minds.

Just kidding. I'm covering a drama class.

I'll see you later.
Okay.

[Seth] All right. Oh!
Bye!

Need that back. Yeah, thanks, Steph.

[Steph hums]

Please, Dad!

Phones are like the new Tamagotchis.

Okay? I need one, and I promise you,
I will not go over the minutes.

Really, it's for my own personal safety,
'cause what happens if I get kidnapped?

I think if you get kidnapped, Stephanie,
they'll probably take your phone.

Not if I'd hidden it up myâ€¦
[clicks tongue]

Well, just to be safe,
it's probably a good thing.

I got you this.


[angelic music plays]

Dadâ€¦

Thank you!
You're welcome.

Oh, you're the best dad!

[Jim chuckles]
[Steph groans]

Dad, I can't believe this!

Hey, guys, uh, it's just me, Stephanie.

I'm just chilling at my crib.
[chimes]

I don't even know how to do this.

I was just thinking that we should bring
prom queen back to Harding High.

#Awesomeldea.
[chimes]

#Yes.
[chimes]

Spread it around. Let's make it a virus.
[chiming]

That'sâ€¦ that's cute.

[Martha over PA] <i>Remember to vote</i>

[Martha] <i>Love you all!</i>

[Bri] Oh my God.
Are you going over there?

Okay.
[Lance] So fire.

until the party to tell everyone.

Oh my God,
is there a party happening? Whoo!

Oh. Hi, Stephanie. What's up?

I just came to say we're, like, cool.

Okay? Even after the other day
when you, like, said I was old and shit.

Oh, did you think that was mean?

I am so sorry.

I was just shedding light

on an often overlooked
discrimination issue.


Queen bee feels very threatened
by the hot new girl

and decides to go on the offensive.

Classic Sandy/Rizzo.
It was the same way with your mum.

I am not my mom. I'm nothing like her.

So whatever went on between you two
has nothing to do with me.

Awesome. Okay, so now that we're friends,
can you follow me on Insta?

I'm "A" with this little circle around it
hot coma girl 113.

Who knew?
There's 112 other hot coma girls.

Mm-hmm. Okay, so I get this request a lot.

Um, I limit my follows,

'cause if I follow one person,
another might get mad,

so it's a sacrifice I make
for everyone's mental health.

Um, but good luck getting followers.

Okay. [Splutters]
Well, wait, can you follow me?

Can I follow her on Instagram?

No.

I can't.

Sorry. [Chuckles]

[sultry music plays]

Hey, Steph.

Holy shit. Mmm.
Um, I'm doing a makeup tutorial.

For who? Batman villains?

I'm just really needing
some new followers.

You don't realize
how many people don't care about you

until you see it
as a number on your phone.

Okay. Well, if you get tired
of being an influencer,

the Natural History Museum is showing
<i>Deep Impact </i>on their IMAX all week.

So, maybe we could go this weekend?

<i>Deep Impact </i>again?

Oh my God. You, me, and Martha
just watched that a couple weekends ago.

Oh no, actually, I think you're thinking
of 1,000 weekends ago.

Oh. Right.

Mm. Okay, I would go,
but I've got a party this weekend.

Oh, cool. Uh, you know, what night?
I'm completely free.

I don't actually know yet,
so I'm just keeping my schedule open.


Just to be clear,

you're saying no to attend
a party you haven't been invited to

and don't know
when or where it's happening?

Yeah. Okay, I gotta get back
to my contouring.


All right.

So hot.

I mean, even just an hour a night,
that would be amazing.

I can make that happen.
Yeah.

Okay.

What's going on?


Why are you guys acting sus?
What? Don't sayâ€¦

Are you two together? Oh my God.
I'm not calling you Mum!

Martha tells me you're already
falling behind in your classes.

Are you doing crack cocaine?

No.

Dad, I'm just still adjusting.

I just found out there were
eight more <i>Fast and Furious</i> movies.

I just wanna make sure that you're giving
your schoolwork the attention it deserves.

Well, I've just been really busy

with super important stuff,
like making friends.

Well, good. I'mâ€¦ That's great.
[Jim] Mm-hmm.

But you can still do your homework.
Yep!

always have been.

I don't wanna see you
use this second chance incorrectly.

Okay. Well, I've got
the solution for this.

No phone for the weekend.

What?
[Jim] Mm-hmm.

Dad, no. How else will I live?

You survived 20 years without solid food.

You can go for a weekend
without your iPhone, hon.

No!
[Jim] Hand it over.

Are you being serious?
[Jim] Yes. I am being very...

Are you being full serious right now?

[Jim] Full serious.
Are you from Syria?

I'm very serious.


No!

Hand me the phone.
Here, have it, then. Have it.

It's a remote.

[groans loudly] No!
Uhâ€¦

Get off the door frame, honey.
No! It's my phone!

Give him the phone.

Noâ€¦

[Martha moans and sighs]

Thanks a lot, Principal Martha.

Oh my God, Lance and Bri look so hot.

What the slut? They're all there.

Can Iâ€¦ can I have my phone back now?

Oh my God.

Guys, what kind of psycho world is this

where the cheerleaders
don't get invited to a party? Hello!

Are they stupid? We are the party!

Babe, of course we weren't invited.

It's DM VIP.
Yeah.

You only get to go to them
if they follow you.

Only the hot, cool people.

Yeah.
Well, yeah, but we are hot and cool.

Thank you.
[Janet] Um,

four years of not getting invited
to those parties,

the message gets, like, very clear.

This is kind of like a party.
I can have my dad pop in a Di.

It means "DiGiorno."

Oh, oh, oh.
No, I'm talking about a "party" party.

I can't have video record of me partying.
The media's gonna use it to try

and discredit me when I run for office,
like they did with AOC.

No.

Okay, guys, you need to listen up,
all right? This is now serious.

[inhales and exhales]

We need to dance
because we need to show everybody

that we are the cool ones.

Guys, when I was in high school,
all the popular kids treated me like shit

until I showed them how cool I was,

which is so cool that
the most popular girl in high school,

her boyfriend dumped her for me.

And you know who that was?
Who?

Bri's mom.
[both] Tiffany?

And that guy,

Bri's dad.

<i>â™ª Oh my God â™ª</i>


And once you've blown someone's dad,
you realize they're not that scary.

Hmm.
Good to know.

Yeah, I meanâ€¦

So, everybody, watch and learn.

Let's dance.
Okay.

Okay, can you hit play?
Yeah, nice fingering.

Please don't blow my dad.

Now, don't worry.
I've spoken with the school nurse,

and with less than three weeks
until graduation,

we are prepared
for an epidemic of senior it is.

But give it up for Miss Riser, everyone.

Stop it.
[laughs] Sorry. Sorry.

Okay. What a special evening
we get to share with our kids

before they go off to adulthood.

Okay, guys,
the energy in this place is sucking wiens.

We need to get out there
and rock their worlds.

Oh, and here's this.

Huh?

It's the music for the routine.
Oh, yes.

Thank you for the computer tampon.
Shove that where that goes.

Really, guys, you're the bomb diggity.

All of you.
[all] Aw!

I love you,

Oh, it's the big finale, you guys.
It's the big finale!

I'm so proud of you.

You pumped to go out there
and change some minds?

[all agreeing]

And just remember, this is all I have.

[Tiffany speaks indistinctly]

[Martha sighs]

And real quick,
due to the custom table-scapes,

the prom ticket prices have gone
from $48 to $93.

We take Venmo and PayPal and Zelle.

Thank you so much!

Yeah!

Okay. Thank you, parents.

Watching you up there.

Shut up.
No, it's true!

Shut up! Look at you!
Yeah?

Look at you now. You're such a...

I'm a DILF. I know. Who would've thought?

[Steph] Hmm.
Hmm.

Oh, and I wanted to say
I thought it was so cool

that I was one of the first places
you stopped when you woke up.

I can't tell you how many times
I've thought of you over the past years.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Well, even though
I was pretty much brain-dead,

you were the one
that kept my heart beating.

Well, listen, I'll just say,
you let me know

if you ever want to take
another trip down memory Blaine.

Yeah, but, Blaine, what about Tiff?
Eh.

Didn't stop us the first time. [Chuckles]

What? You said you two were broken up.

It's, uhâ€¦ You know, I don'tâ€¦


[Steph] What?
I was joking.

I haven't forgotten
about your whole "no cheating" rule.

Yeah, which is why we can't be together.

Yet.

But if you're the man

I'm sure you'll make the right choice.

Yeah. No, Iâ€¦

I don't get what the big deal was.
We were just dancing!

Steph, the big deal is that I told you
that we don't do that anymore,

and you went
and did it anyway behind my back.

Are you really mad?
Or is this because Tiff yelled at you?

Oh, Steph!

You can't let her bully you,
I've always said that.

It's not about Tiffany.

I care about this

because what you did up there,
it wasn't school-appropriate.

You fondled yourself

for an unsuspecting audience
in a routine about consent.

But I gave myself consent

to do that to myself.

Stop stroking your nipples.

Marth, what is going on here?

The cheerleaders aren't allowed to dance.

You took away prom queen.

You turned the cafeteria
into a Hogwarts without the magic.

Are you trying
to make this place suck wiens?

Number one, how dare you?
It is like Hogwarts with the magic.

And number two,
it doesn't suck wiens. It's nice.

It'sâ€¦ it's nice here.

I had more fun in a coma.
You did not have more fun in the coma.

I had more fun going like this.



That was way more fun
than this high school.

Steph, this may come as a shock to you,
but for most kids, high school sucks.

I don't know why you're acting
like we didn't have the same experience.

High school was awesome!

Freshman year, you bailed on Seth and I
to go be some popular girl.

No, I didn't bail. I just got more friends

and a really hot boyfriend.

Seriously, if you'd had a boyfriend,
you would have understood.

Stephanie, I wouldn't understand
because I'm gay.

unless you're saying it

in a neutral-positive way
to refer to someone that isâ€¦

Mm-hmm.

Oh.


And itâ€¦ it made high school
a living hell for me.

Back then, I felt very alone

and angry and so threatened

that if I showed one iota of my real self,
then I would be ripped to shreds

by Tiffany or Blaine or you.

Me?

No way. Why would you even say that?

Because, Steph,
sometimes I didn't know who you were.

Orâ€¦ are.

Oh, yeah, I find it helps them grow.
Still a dork.

Huh.
[Steph] Soâ€¦

Uh,

do you, like, still wanna see <i>Deep Impact?</i>

[scanner beeps]


Maybe some freeze-dried space ice cream.
Maybe some Milk Duds, some Whoppers,

some Juicy Fruit.
I gotta keep this girlish figure.

You want anything, orâ€¦

Um, oh, no, no, no, don't go just yet.
Just hang here for one second.

Yeah, sure.

Oh my God, Seth, you're such a gentleman
going to get the snacks.

Oh my God, I swear,
you have such a massive dick.

What did you say?
What? Oh, Blaine, Tiffany.

Hi!
Hi! What are you doing here?

What a coincidence.

I'm, um, here on a date with Seth.

He asked me out, and I said,

"You know what? I am single
and so horny, so yes."

Isn't that right?
Yep.

Really?

Wait, I'm sorry.
You are on a date with Sethany?

Well, it's just Seth.
[Tiffany chuckles]

Relax. I'm just joking. [Chuckles]

Well, yeah,
we're just here to see a movie.

It's not like
we're gonna have hot, consensual sex

when the lights go down.


Wow! Uhâ€¦

Wow, Seth, it only took 20 years
and some brain damage,

but she finally agreed
to go out with you. Way to go!

Again, just joking. [Laughs]

[laughs sarcastically]

[Steph] Hilarious.
Let's go find our seats.

Huh?
Let's go find our seats.

We gotta go find our seats.
Down in front, yep.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah. [Sucks teeth]

[dramatic music plays]


Are you serious about that?

Yeah, just be awesome.
Justâ€¦ just toss some into my mouth.

All right.



Oh my God. It's stuck in my throat.
Oh, I'm choking.

No, I reallyâ€¦ I just got a Milk Dud.
Did you actually choke on that?

Yeah, it's stuck right there,
but it's all right.

Shut up!

Bitch, turn your ugly face around
and watch the movie.

Shut up, Blaine.

Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to be quiet.

I am not the problem.

There is a freaking porno
happening over there!

What?
[Tiffany] Don't put that on my face.

It is not my fault.
I am not doing anything.

Be quiet. I'm trying to watch the movie.

You're afraid you'll miss something?

The asteroid hits,

and TÃ©a Leoni and her Austrian dad
get hit by a ginormous wave.

[crowd] Aw.
What?

Oh, come on! We all knew that!

Can youâ€¦ [hisses]

Sorry.
Ma'am?

Iâ€¦

Ma'am, come with me.
Okay, fine. Blaine?

What is the name of your manager?

Sir? I am going to have
to email your manager.

[crowd applauding, cheers]

[Seth laughs]
[Steph] Ah!

Two decades later, and I still love
watching Tiff lose her mind.

I mean, that was incredibly satisfying.
Mm-hmm.

Okay, now I understand

why you devoted so much of your time
on it in high school. [Laughs]

Well, not the whole time.
Oh?

Just all of my junior,
sophomore, and most of my senior year.

Mm. Mm-hmm.

Anyways, Marth told me
something about you in high school.

Oh God. What?

She said that you had
a crush on me. [Chuckles]

Yes.

When we were in high school,
I was very much in love with you.

Seth!

Eh.
You were? Really?

Eh.
Why didn't you ever say anything?

we were friends.

Yeah.
And you were with Blaine.

And, you know, we both know
what your answer would've been.

Maybe, maybe not.
We're hanging out right now, aren't we?

Yeah, but that's only because you thought
you could use me to make Blaine jealous.

Steph, come on. I'm a full-blown adult.

I think I can recognize
a teenage trick when I see one.

That's not what's going on.

Oh, come on, you used to pull this with me
and Marth all the time in high school.

You'd use our attention
to make the popular kids crave yours.

Um, did I?

Yes.

We always wondered
if those kids ever got to really meet you.

Like, the real you.

Well, I did have
a really fun time tonight.

[Seth chuckles]

I'mâ€¦ I'm sorry.

No, forget it.

So should I take you home?

Or we could continue to hang out.
I have an idea of where we could go.

[man coughs]

Whoa, okay. This place has changed.

Yeah, I think the lights are just on.

[Steph] Come on.
[Seth] Okay.

Bri, baby, I need favor.

I want you
to get prom king and queen reinstated.

What?

Mom.

No. No one cares about that.

I do.

I want you to beat Steph for prom queen.

You said it rewards archaic gender roles.

Well, exactly, which is why
you need to be the woke prom queen.

I've already got interest
from some brands,

and they are supes into it.

Mom. I'm not doing this.

And don't say "woke" or "supes."

[tense music plays]

Just beat Steph for mommy.

You owe me.

For what?

For being alive.

And if you wanna go on your trip to Nepal,
you will do this for me.

[tense music ends]

Can I ask you something?
Hmm?

Does it get exhausting trying to make
everybody like you all the time?

Well,

it will be worth it when I win prom queen.

Well, what I remember about prom
is that it was overhyped,

you weren't there, and it sucked.

That's your memories of prom. That's it?
Yeah, pretty much.

Seth! Dude, come on.

Did you even try to have fun? Did you
even try to tear it up on the dance floor?

Just, like, give it the old groove? No!
Yeah!

It wouldn't have mattered,
because prom doesn't matter,

especially not prom queen.

You maniac.

Come on, Steph.

You will yourself out of a coma,
and that's what you care about?

It's more than just a crown to me.
Hmm.

When I moved here to America,

it was so hard.

Everyone made fun of me, as you remember.
Yeah.

And then Mum got sick.

And I was miserable. I was so miserable.

[sad music plays]

And you know what she used to say
to help cheer me up?

She'd, like, say, "Steph, close your eyes
and imagine your perfect life."

"And if you can imagine it,
you can have it."

I was likeâ€¦ [scoffs] â€¦ "Shut up, Mom."

I didn't believe her.

Then she died.


I didn't tell anyone, but I wasâ€¦
I was more miserable than ever.


And then one day when we were driving
and I saw Deanna Russo,

and I was like, "Whoa, she's happy."

And she was prom queen,

and Iâ€¦ I need to be her. Okay?

I wanted to be her so badly.

And I was getting there,
and then all of a sudden, boom. [Scoffs]

Coma. Lights out.

And I was bloody miserable again.

Then I thought, "Wellâ€¦

I should see if I can prove my mum right."


"I shouldâ€¦ I should really try
and get that perfect life," you know?

[emotional music plays]

Okay, definitely not just a crown.
Sorry about that. I'm an asshole.

No, you'reâ€¦ [laughs]

No, you're not.
[chuckles] All right.

[Seth] Oh!
Oh! You did it. You got it!

Oh my God, okay.

[cheering]
Yeah!

Woot, woot.

Oh my God!
That's all yours. You can have that.

[chuckles]
[toy squeaks]

<i>â™ª Now it's time to take my placeâ€¦ â™ª</i>

Do you wanna go to prom with me?


I promise you, you'll have a good time.

Well, I already signed up
to be a chaperone, so, yeah, I'll go.

Yeah?
Uh-huh.

Awesome!
[laughs]

Great.
[laughs] Yeah.

Okay. All right. Wait.

Let me try to win you something now.
Okay. Yeah.

Oh my God!

the sacred privacy of student elections.

But I'm totally voting for you.
Absolutely! Later, prom queen!

Can you believe it?

You might make history after all.

The first person
to ever lose prom queen twice.

Don't go chasing waterfalls, Steph.

What was that?

Oh, nothing.

Slut bag.

What did you just call me?

Nothing.
Possum pussy.

Rumpel-slut-skin.
Jizz collector.

You're a sad wife.

What did you say?

I didn't say shit, but you heard me.

[tense music plays]

[cell phones chiming]


It's an invite to a prom party at Bri's.

An invite?
Check your phone!

Oh my God! I got invited!

Can you believe that?
We got invited!

Steve Aoki is DJing.
Right?

Steve Aoki? I love it!



Steph. Steph, we're not gonna go probably
'cause, I mean, it's a $50 cover.

Oh, yeah.
[Neil] That's so expensive.

I can't afford that.

Why didn't you tell me we were hosting it?
I'd have got that aphrodisiac wine.

I didn't know.

[tense music continues]

[tense music intensifies]

[tense music ends]

Hi, guys.

I am so pumped to announce

that I will be hosting the biggest
and the best prom after-party

at a super secret locaish.

It's free to get in, unlike Bri's.

It's gonna be awesome.

So, DM me a picture of your ballot
voting me as prom queen,

and you'll get all the deets night of.

[Jim sighs]

This is weird for me too, sir.


Stephie!

Wanna hurry it up? [Sighs]

You want a beer?

Oh, uh, sure.

[mimics buzzer] Wrong answer, hot rod.

You think I'll let you drink
and drive with my daughter?

Oh, well, I'm actually not driving.
We're taking a Lyft.

Oh, cool.

Though I suspect Stephanie would prefer
not to spend her prom evening

with a drunken fool.

It would just be the o...

No, I think I'm okay, actually.
I'll maybe have a water, if anything.

Did you bring some condoms?
[murmurs]

Um, no.

Hm. Didn't think we needed
to have this talk, but, uh, Seth,

you are aware that unprotected sex
can lead to geriatric pregnancies?

Stephie!
You ready to be an old dad?

I'm sorry, do you want me
to sleep with your daughter?

Or...
What did you just ask me?

It's...
[Steph] Okay, I'm ready!

Yeah.

I'm surprised you're here.

Aren't you normally on a Saturday night
just home sharpening your teeth?

You know, I just want to say

the noble thing would be to do
what the rest of these students are doing

and vote for Bri.

Oh. [Laughs]

Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

Well, I always do the noble thing.

Vote for Bri.
Is it spelled like the cheese?

B, R, I.

Hmm.

Interesting.

Ooh.

Yep. Right in there.

There.

I'm just so confident.

Just vote for me.

You know you're not eligible
for prom queen, right?

That's right, I'm not.
I'm not eligible for prom queen.

And it's probably killing you
that you aren't either.

Relax, Tiff.

I'm just joking.

[both chuckle]

That's funny.
It's funny. It was a joke. Yeah.

It was a joke.

We're perfect together. Admit it.

After-party at Bri's house
with live music.

And spoiler alert, party favors
are Beats by Dre headphones!

Bri, will you tell them? [Exhales]

Hey, everyone, after-party
is at Steph's place. See you there.

Wait, what are you doing?
The house is ready for the party.

I mean, Steve Aoki is in our living room.
What am I going to tell him?

I don't know.
Tell him you lost prom queen.

[rap music plays]

Shit. Shit.

[crowd chants] Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!


[rap music continues]

Yes, hi. I'd like to report
a rowdy high school party

with tons of underage drinking.

And... Oh my God!

I think an adult is hosting it.

["Bossed Up" by KC Carter plays]
[crowd chants indistinctly]

[crowd cheers]

Yeah!

Hey!

Hey, Janet!

Come on!

No, don't film me!
Why?

The media will use it
to try and discredit me.

Wait, no.

Fuck it! Fuck it! Film me! Film me!
Okay. Okay.

Yeah, come on, yeah.
That's right. It's the president, bitch!

Yeah!
Suck my vulva!

[both scream]

["Bossed Up" continues playing]

Oh my God, whose tooth is this?

[siren wails]
Oh shit.

Cops!

Where? Wait. Okay, wait...
[boy] Bye, Stephanie.

No. Oh my God.

[tense music plays]

Oh my God, Martha,
I was just about to call you.

Steph, what in ever living fuck
were you thinking?

You said I could use the house.
Are you kidding? Twenty years ago.

And even then,
I didn't want you to use it.

Did you even think about me?
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

This is all kinds of illegal.

Oh my God, they're gonna make
a Netflix documentary about me.

Well, wait. Okay, think about that.
That could be really cool.

Thatâ€¦ that could be epic.

Look how well it turned out
for Tiger King.

No.

No, it's not epic or cool.

God, you're the same as in high school.

So you don't want a drink?
No, I don't want a drink!

You need to grow up!

You're not a teenager!

I know I'm not. I'm an adult.
Is that what you want to hear?

Yes, I am a 37-year-old 12th grader.

You don't think I know how crazy it is
going back to high school in this body?

What else was I supposed to do? [Chuckles]

What else did I have?
You had me, and you had Seth.

Everybody else just got to go on
and live their lives.

I'm supposed to just jump forward?

I'm just not allowed
to ever make mistakes?

Making mistakes is different

than willfully screwing over
the people who care about you.

You pushed us away.

They were not your friends.
We were your friends.

We were the ones who cared about you.

We were the ones
who showed up at the hospital.

They never came to the hospital.
None of them.

I can't believe you would say that.

I got tons of birthday cards.

Did you even look
to see who they were from?

[stomach growls]

[groans and vomits]

[Martha coughs]


Was that curry?

I'm done. You can find your own way home.


Hey, Seth. [Chuckles]

[indistinct chatter over police radio]

Finally.

I saw you followed Stephanie on Insta.

Don't you wanna know if I got arrested
at that party you called the cops on?

I know it was you.

Do you think I do this stuff for fun?
I'm looking out for you.

We could have made
a hundred grand tonight.

We could've used that money
as a donation to get you into college.

So you could blog
about being an Ivy League mom?

Oh well, I guess
I'll have to get in myself.

I want you to have the perfect life,

like me.

The perfect life online means nothing
when you're miserable in real life.

We are not miserable.

Yeah, we are.


No elite person
follows more than 100 people.

So you gotta go.

[gasps]
You are toast.

Hey, your family's fucked up.

Are we doing this?
I got another gig in an hour.

You know what? Fuck you, Steve Aoki.

["Drive" by Leslie Hayes McCann plays]
<i>â™ª Life is a second â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Gone in an instant â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Defined by a momentâ€¦ â™ª</i>

No offense,
but you look like a prom queen.

Holy shit, Deanna Russo?

Yeah. Do we know each other?

Oh my God. No. Iâ€¦ I meanâ€¦
Well, I know who you are.

You're a legend at Harding High.

You won prom queen and had a perfect life.


Yeah. Uh, let's see, umâ€¦

I was divorced before I was 30
when my husband left me

for a 21-year-old barista
with two more abs than I had.

And I was left with no credit
and no job prospects.

My advice, throw that crown away now.

You know what prom queen got me?

An even spray tan

and the ability to dodge bleach poisoning
every time I get my hair done.

Well, I mean, that is a skill.


But, uh, imagine all the other skills
I would have had if I'd gone to college.

I don't know where I would be,

but I do know it wouldn't be
taking courses at the community college

while hustling
to make rent between two jobs.

The only thing I look forward to
is taking my pants off at night.

Oh my God. I do that too now.

It's so good, right?
Yeah. Just likeâ€¦

[mimics snapping off buttons]
[Deanna sighs] Yeah.

But it's all worth it
'cause I am going to get a degree,

and I am going to have a career,
and that is everything.

And for the first time in my life,
I'm excited about the future

instead of holding on to the past.

I'm not hungry.

Oh, come on. Sit down with me.
Have breakfast with your old dad.

[inhales and exhales]

where you're sitting at graduation yet?

On my butt?


I just wanna get a good seat
so I can see you.


I'm not gonna go to graduation, Dad.

Seth and Martha won't talk to me,

and I don't think
anybody else wants me there.

Well, I want you there.

That doesn't count.

Yes, it does.

I count.

I know you used to roll your eyes
whenever Mom would compliment you,

tell you how amazing,
beautiful, wonderful you were,

like she had to say it 'cause she was Mom,

but she wanted to

because she believed it, deeply.

One of the last things
she said to me was to make sure

that you knew how to receive love.

And I spent every day of your coma
wondering if I messed up,

soâ€¦ let me be clear.

Don't waste your time
telling the people who love you the most

that they don't count.

They are the only ones that count.


Thanks, Dad.

Yeah.

{\an8}But it's the only way

{\an8}And they're the ones

{\an8}They're the ones I want,
more than anything, to forgive me.

["Grow as We Go" ends]


That's it.

Dad, just stop it! Press stop.

[Jim] Sorry.
[phone beeps]

That was beautiful.

Tiff.

won't, um, unblock me unlessâ€¦

I came to apologize to you.

Seriously?
Soâ€¦

Umâ€¦

I am sorry for everything I've done

and for treating you
like human garbage all these years.

Tiff, I'm not the one you should be trying
to make things right with.

You and Blaine have an awesome daughter

who's so smart and way cooler
than what you and I ever were.

Stop competing with her.

There's enough room for both of you.

There's enough room for all of us.

We don't need to fight with each other.
