Maybe we'll find you a cute guy.

I'm not really

Maybe not.
But they'll be looking at you.

Fine.

Where is this place

Right this way.

It's in Barstow.

I don't think I can do this

Oh, come on, Liv.
Don't be a pussy.

I'm not!


Where else can we go?

Um, well...

we could get a Lyft

Do you...

Do you know how much

Oh, God.

Who are you?

You said you wanted to meet
during the day.

You're you?
What are you doing?

I'm sure you can
figure that out.

No.
No, no, no, no, no!

Why are you doing this?!
Who are you?!

Okay!

Do you actually want me
to answer your questions,

or are you just
being hysterical?

I have money.

I have money too.

In fact, you know,
most people have money.

You don't
have to do this.

Well, of course
I don't have to.

Then, why?

That is such a big question,
and you don't even know my name.

What's your name?

Soren.

Are you gonna kill me?

Please. Please.

Please!
You don't have to do this!

Okay!
Calm down!


Oh, wow.
You actually calmed down.

Have you kidnapped
other girls?

Yes.

And did you kill them?

Yes.

I'm not
a very good person.

And I'm not sure
if that's because of

the choices
I've made in my life

or because
of my messed-up brain.

I hear a voice in my head.

What voice?

You know, I never
really caught its name.

What does it say?

It revealed to me
the reason of my existence.

You see,
we all have a purpose.

Mine's to kill.

Killing is not
your purpose.

I have to listen
to the voice.

That is ridiculous.
Look, no you don't, okay?

You don't want to do this.
You can let me go.

Okay, enough!

Here is
what's going to happen.

I'm going play with you
for a while.

And when I'm satisfied...

I'm gonna end your life.

So, I will give you
a moment...

...to accept that.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

You are being unusually quiet.

Maybe that's 'cause
you like her too.

â™ª suspense score â™ª

So!

How are you doing?

Oh, don't be embarrassed.

You know, you're actually
doing quite well.

Really must be accustomed
to pain.

Did you ever go through
a self-harm period?

Maybe as a teenager?

No.

It's very strange.

The feeling of when
someone else cuts you,

it's different than
when you do it to yourself.

Wonder why that is.

I don't know.

Here.

Now, Miranda...

We're going to play
a game.


I know, I know.

I'm mixing up
my horror films.

But I just couldn't find
a Jigsaw mask.

What game?

Using that knife, I want you
to cut yourself

and then cut my arm.

But just a little bit.

Why would I do that?

Because if you do,
I won't hurt you anymore today.

I bet you're thinking about
stabbing me,

but that is not
a good idea.

Why not?

Because <i>if</i> you kill me...

...you're never gonna reach
the key to those chains.

And if you stab me,
you're gonna find out

just how painful
acid burns are.


This is a good chance for you
to find out who you are Miranda.

Although I already know
that answer.

What answer?

You are nothing.

You live in a small city
in the middle of nowhere,

and you will only be
special to me.

Fuck you.

You're nothing!

No. I am the one in control
of your life.

No, no, no!

Well, then,

She's not here.

Remember, I killed her,

Hey, asshole!

Where are you going?

You're not here

Well, I feel pretty fucking real
right now!

I killed you!
Yeah, three times!

So, then, you cannot be
standing there!

Well, I am!

And I am just as goddamn
confused as you are.

This is fine.
I am hallucinating.

I'm going to walk in the shack,
and I'm gonna see her body.

What are you?

As far as I know, a-a girl.

Okay, yeah, but this doesn't
really make any...

What, make any sense?
Yeah, no shit!

Okay.
I-I can figure this out.

Good.
Please do!

Okay, just stop
walking towards me!

Or what?
What are you gonna do to me?

I will rape you.

Okay.

I consent.

What?
Well, now you can't rape me.

That's not how this works.
You can't just say...

No, it's cool.
We can fuck if you want.

I mean, it might help us calm
the hell down a little.

You can't just say,
"I consent."

Too bad.

I mean,
you've, uh [CHUCKLES]

already ruined my top.

Apparently, my clothes
don't exactly heal with me.

Did you take that backpack I had
when you kidnapped me?

Give me your keys.

Uh, what are you doing?

I brought
a change of clothes.

Where are we?

We're about six hours
outside of Barstow.

Is this where you take
all your victims?

Okay, killer?
I need you to focus.

I agree that this is

quite a unique situation
that we are in right now,

but I need you to understand
the facts.

Somehow, If I die,
I instantly come back to life.

All wounds healed.

And you are going to give me
a ride home.

No.
You tortured me.

So I am turning this
on you.

I am not going to leave
your side until I figure out

what to do with you
and what the hell I am!

I do not believe
this is happening.

Feel free
to kill me again.

This is lethal injection.

This is enough
to kill a horse.

Okay.


Dude.

This is weird.


You should, um...

Seatbelt.

I'm good.

Okay.
This silence is killing me.

Don't you listen to music
in your car?

No.

You don't like music?

Not even bands like Slayer
or Death?

Usually when I'm driving,
I hear the voice.

Maybe you could ask the voice
to sing for you.

No, it just tells me to kill
someone over and over again.

Are you hearing
the Voice now?

No.

Then maybe we can listen
to some music.

You still don't think I'm real,
do you?

You need to get gas.

Um, excuse me?

Just to... clear things up,

you can see me, right?

I can see you.

Hey, you!

Can you see him?

The guy
in the giant rabbit costume?

Yeah, I can see him.

And you can see her too,
right?

Yeah.
I can totally see her.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

I don't think we picked
the most reliable sources.

Why are you wearing that?

I do have my reasons.
But it's no simple story.

Ah!

I'd like to hear.

Can I buy you a drink?

Uh, wow.

Yes!

God, I haven't had anything
to drink in like two days.


So... the suit?

My father died
two days ago.

Ever since he turned
42 years old,

he began to wear
this big rabbit costume.

He would go to work,
come home,

eat dinner with us while
still wearing the costume.

My mother and I
were understandably baffled.

We asked him why on earth
he was doing this.

My father's answer
was this.

[TRAFFIC PASSING]

He was meant to die...

...and it was this suit
that was keeping him alive.

â™ª score â™ª

He just held this
illogical belief.

And he continued to wear
the suit for years.

â™ª continues â™ª

Then one morning
I woke up.

I found my father collapsed
on the ground

in front of his closet.

He was dead.

And the rabbit costume
was in front of him.

But I've continued to wear
this suit ever since he died.

I have people I care about.

â™ª score â™ª

How did your father die?

Heart attack.

I think
I was faking it a bit.

But you didn't know
you were...

That I was immortal?
No.

Don't cut me off
while I'm talking.

Don't tell me what to do.

I-I felt the impact
of the cuts.

And the stab.
And the acid.

But it all felt
weirdly distant.

You screamed
and you cried.

I think that was more
from the actual shock

of what
was happening to me.

How many people
have you killed?

I have a confession too.

You were my first.

So you were lying to me.

I wanted to be confident!

In your choice to murder me?
How thoughtful!

So, what made me so special that
I was your... your first victim?

None of the other girls were special to me.
None of the what?

I have kidnapped other people
before you.

And done what to them?

Because I seem to remember
you threatening to rape me.

Oh, that?

I just wanted you
to shut up.

I wouldn't
actually rape anyone!

Okay, so you're not a rapist.

Well, that makes up for the fact
that you took me away

from my family
and tortured me for three days!

I let the other girls
go free.

You are not a good person.

I never claimed to be!

I want to know why you decided
to kill <i>me!</i>

I told you my reason
and my purpose for being...

Oh, fuck off
with that nonsense!

It is not nonsense!
It is!

It is ridiculous to follow
a voice in your head

without ever considering
that it might not actually

be who you are!

The voice in my head
is who I am!

I have had urges to kill
my entire life, okay?

I mean, the voice started
forming as I grew up,

and it's gotten so loud now
that I can't suppress my urges!

Is that supposed to make me
feel sorry for you?

You've kidnapped and terrified
other girls.

I mean, you have probably
ruined lives.

Do you even think
about that?

Oh, and how would you feel if
every morning when you woke up,

There was a piercing voice
in your head

telling you
to kill someone?!

I would probably seek out
professional help

like a rational
human being!

Human?

Humans are
fucking trash.

I mean, this... this whole world
is absolute shit.

No one cares
about anything.

Everyone is just
a bunch of liars.

Every decision we make
is selfish.

We are a disease,

and we infect everything
we touch!

There is no point to life,
so what the hell does it matter

if a couple girls
go missing?!

You should
just kill yourself.

I'm done talking with you.

Well, too bad,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

Really?

What is this?

One bit of criticism,
and you shut down.

You just told me
to kill myself.

Oh, I am so sorry.

Could it be that maybe that
I'm just a little stressed out

that I just found out
I can't die?!

Why are you here?

Just leave me alone.

No.

No, you got what you wanted.
You know why I killed you.

Okay, <i>we</i> are not done.

Oh, and also
I know you're real now.

All right, I know you're some
wondrous anomaly

that's gonna have
some great existence.

I'm not gonna be there
and I don't fucking care.

God damn it, dude.
Not yet!

I didn't mean what I said, okay?
I am confused.

I am angry.
I am fucking terrified, okay?!

You are not the only one
that is concerned

with what's real
and what's not!

What's do you have to be
concerned about?

You're...

You're fine.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

Am I?

My body feels like it is being
torn away from this world,

like I am literally light enough
to float away on the wind.

And you...

Your stupid reasons

are the only thing
that is keeping me grounded

on this earth.

Why not?

Should you be sitting

Hmm.

Why do you carry a stuffed fox

He's my traveling companion.

He?

What's his name?

His name is Percy.

So, what are you doing out here
in the middle of just nothing?

Well, I wouldn't
call this "nothing."

There are bushes, cacti,
and plenty of insects.

But, to answer your question,
I'm just out for a long walk.

Well, Percy and I.

Percy is very beautiful.

Thank you.

He keeps me company
when I'm feeling lonely.

How does he do that?

We talk to each other.


Yeah, okay,
first the rabbit guy, now you.

No, I'm going insane.

Oh, I very much doubt that.

This world has always been
a realm of madness.

You talk to a stuffed fox.

You talk to a voice
in your head.

What do you and Percy
talk about?

Today we got into
a conversation about ants.

Oh, fascinating.

You, quiet!

What about ants?

Well, we found a line of ants
by the side of the road

and they were
picking apart a dead crow,

bringing pieces of it
back to their hill.

And I started thinking how easy
it would be

to stomp down on the ants
and kill a bunch of them,

when Percy brought up
something strange.

"You do not kill the ants,
for they will not remember.

You do not fear the ants,
for they need to survive.

You do not communicate
with the ants,

for they cannot comprehend
your existence.

The rabbit is the vacancy
of the land.

The fox is the winding
of the road.

The cat is the multitude
of the stars.

In a world of fire,
you will meet the deer.

There you must decide
who you are."

I asked him what he meant,
but he went silent.

Pull over.

Just do it!

I can't die.

Because that would mean
that in a million years

And if I don't age,
then, what,

does my brain just never

I mean, I will lose the capacity

I mean, why should
I even bother...

ever getting close

and whoever kills me
the most would win.

Hey, Soren?

Are you happy?

Not everything
is about happiness, Miranda.

Oh! [LAUGHS]

Have you ever... you ever had
a girlfriend?

No.
No?

You ever been in love?

No-o-o!

Man, that sucks.

Did you honestly think
my answer would be "yes"?

â™ª somber score â™ª

In the desert,

when you were [LAUGHS] hitting
me in the face with a rock...

Yeah.

...you... you helped me up.

So?

About a year ago,
I was dating this guy.

One day we were walking,
and I tripped over a root

and I fell
into a puddle.

He didn't help me up.

He filmed me
in my wet clothes

and posted the video
on Instagram.

Yeah, that sucks.

This other time I was talking
to a guy at a party,

and I was...
I was really sad

because like a day ago
my parakeet died.

And...

every time I tried
to talk about it,

he... he would just change
the subject.

Maybe you need to hang out
with better people.

Maybe I am.

All right, well,
what are you doing?

I...

am seeing how much alcohol
it will take to kill me.

You know that.

No, I mean...

I mean, why are you telling me
these stories?

I literally can't remember
anything I just said.

â™ª score â™ª

â™ª continues â™ª


How much did it take?

Two and a half bottles.


So, are you, like...
are you sober now?

Completely.

That was nuts!

I mean, I have never blacked out
that quickly.

Did I, uh...

do or say
anything weird?

No. Uh...

You...
You just lost your balance.

I did more than that.

I remember
making you laugh.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Every fucked-up situation
needs a little humor.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Yes?

WOMAN: I'm sorry to bother
you so early in the morning,

but we need everyone
to evacuate the hotel.

Why?

We've had some reports
of gas leaks

inside several
of the rooms.

It's a matter of safety.

Come by the office,
and we'll refund your money.

Thank you.
I'll... I'll be out soon.

Did you hear?

That's scary.

I mean, if that was really
a gas leak, we would have died.

Right.

Just you.

Hey.

A gas leak.

How about that?

Yeah.

Guy I'm traveling
with could've died.

The "guy"?

Usually people are
more descriptive

about who
they're traveling with.

I met him a few days ago.

But you were concerned
about his life.

I think I'm growing concerned
with all life.

You're probably wondering
why I'm sitting

on this dumpster lid.

I'm sure
you have your reasons.

There's a cat inside.

Is it both dead and alive
at the same time?

No.
It's... It's dead.

After I heard about
the gas leak, I...

I came out to throw the trash,
and...

I found the cat inside.

So, naturally.

I panicked and I threw myself
on top of the dumpster lid,

trying to will the dead cat
out of existence.

Are you okay?

Am I okay?

That's a valid question.

Are you okay?

Yes and no.

Well, it's a solid no
for me.

I've been that way
for a while.

And it's all because of that...
that thing in the dumpster!

The dead cat?

Yes,
the fucking dead cat!

I'm sorry.

I've just been seeing
so many of them.

It started a year ago.

And it's been getting worse
ever since.

At first I didn't think
anything of it.

I went to take out the trash,
and there was a dead cat.

Now it's every day.

No matter what I do
or where I go,

I see them.

Out in a park, eating lunch,
there's one under my table.

At a bar, and there's one
in the bathroom.

I'm walking home, and I hear one
get hit by a car.

And they're always
mangled corpses too.

None of them
died peacefully.

You think I'm crazy.

Go.
Check for yourself.

It's about 15 minutes.

What's gonna happen
when we get there?

I don't know.

They're gonna ask me
so many questions.

Maybe you should
just tell them.

Tell them what?
That I can't die?

They would put me
in an asylum!

Or... a government lab.

No, I mean about me.

What I did.

You want me
to turn you in?

It's what I deserve.

That's a big change
of opinion.

Dude, I am not gonna
condemn you.

It would be fitting.

You are the only one
I can talk to.

Okay, we're...

We're friends.

I mean, I know it's not...
We can't be friends Miranda.

Sure we can.

No.

You're...

What?

What?

I don't belong
in your world.

And what exactly
is my world?

I have no idea.

But whatever it is,
there is no place for me.

I'm not a good person.

Okay, it's best
if I drop you off here.

Maybe I don't have to
go back.

Your friends and family
miss you.

Well, I need your number.
I don't have a phone.

Then tell me
where you live.

You and I will never see
each other again.

Screw that.

What are you gonna do?

Dude!

Get out of my car.

All right, fine!

Go off on your own.

I mean, die alone like everyone
else on this planet!

MAN: Miranda, can you hear me?

You're in shock.

You've been missing
for three days.

We found no wounds
on your body,

but your clothes have rips
on them,

and that indicates to us
that someone attacked you.

Can you tell me anything
about what happened to you?

Did someone hurt you, Miranda?

Can you tell us anything
about who he is?

What do you remember?

Miranda.

You're safe now.

Look, you can talk to me.

Any information you can give us

will help us catch
whoever took you.

I was so scared!


He was with me the whole time.

Yes, yes.
Okay, now concentrate please.

What happened next?
I don't remember much.

I...

He did something terrible.

It's all right.

You're safe now.

What did he do to you?

He...

He...

He bought me a sandwich!

So, what did you want
to talk to us about?

I'm not quite sure
how to put it...

So, I'm just gonna... I'm just
gonna ask straight up.

Do you know what I am?

Like, are you...
are you too the same?

Did we come
from a different planet?

What is this?

Dad...

If I were to cut off your arm,
what would happen?

The same thing that would happen
to anybody else.

Miranda, what's going on
with you?

Is it really just me?

Honey,
you need some rest.

You'll feel better
in the morning.

You know, I can't stay
in this house forever.

It's a beautiful night.

That it is.

Now, Miss...

Miranda.
Miranda.

I do admit to having
some curiosity,

as to why a pretty
young woman like yourself

is sitting alone
around a campfire

in the dead of the night.

I was looking
for someone.

I didn't find him.

It is a big world.

Finding a single person
is no easy task.

I don't even know if he's
in this city anymore.

I don't even know
if he's alive.

I know your struggle.

The lives of friends and family
are so fragile.

People die like ants.

Why are you out here?

Who are you?

Miranda...

No.
Who are you?

You know me.

We have spoken before.

I have many faces.

You see me every day,
for I am everywhere,

always around you
whether you notice me or not.

What's so funny?

I apologize for laughing.

But do you want to know
the truth?

I don't know
what you are.

What?

I am everywhere.

I have seen life in places
you could not dream of.

But I have never met
someone like you.

Really?

Even you don't have
any answers?

Indeed.

But I think that's
quite wonderful.

Even I can find pleasant
new surprises in this world.

I can tell you this...
You will never die.

Your body protects you from
any conceivable possibility.

Your form does not
grow past this age,

but your mind is open
to infinite expansion.

You shall live to see
what lies beyond the stars.

And despite all this,
you are human.

Do you know if Soren
is still alive?

He is.

But his whereabouts
are unknown to me.

Will I ever
talk to you again?
