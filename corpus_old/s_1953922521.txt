Ah, vacation.

Three months of glorious
nonconstructive downtime.

Now, if you ask real nice, Hammy,
I'll consider letting you hang out with me.

-Gee, that's nice of you, Plucky, but--
-Now, what will we do first? The beach?

[PLUCKY GASPS]

Camping?

[BEAR GROWLING]

[PLUCKY SCREAMS & HAMTON GULPS]

Or shall we simply veg
the whole 12 weeks away...

...in front of the boob tube?

-[SINGING] <i>We're tiny</i>
<i>-We're toony</i>

<i>We're all a little--</i>

But, Plucky,
I'm going out of town this summer.

Huh?

HAMTON:
My folks are taking me to Happy World Land.

Happy World Land?

Not the happiest place,
go on all the rides till you barf...

...fun for kids of all ages
Happy World Land?

-Uh, yeah.
-Gasp and drool.

That's every duckling's dream.

WADE:
Ha, ha. Oh, Hamton.

Hurry up, son. Ha, ha.

We're all raring to go.

HAMTON: Okay, Dad.
-No.


I'll send you a postcard.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

So long. Have a nice summer.

PLUCKY:
<i>Happy World Land?</i>

CLOWNS:
Ha, ha, you can't go.

Ha, ha, you can't go.

Ha, ha, you can't go.

Mwah.

CLOWNS:
Ha!

WADE:
Anyone have to use the powder room? Ha, ha.

WINNIE: No, dear.
HAMTON: No, Dad.

All right, then.

[ENGINE REVVING]

Bye, Plucky.

There he goes.

My best pal,
off on the dream vacation of a lifetime...

...while I sit here and rot alone.

Oops. Dropped the toilet paper.

We'll see who gets left behind.

Old Bessie's about to hit 100,000 miles.

We have to record this for posterity.

Hooray!

Whoops. Ha, ha.

Forgot to take off the lens cap.

WINNIE & HAMTON: Aw.
WADE: Ah, we'll back up and do it again.


ALL:
Hooray!

I think the left front tire is a little low.

Aha.

Why, Plucky,
did you want to come on our trip too?

No, no. No, ma'am.

I'll just spend my summer here,
alone and forgotten.


Gee, Dad, can't we take Plucky with us?

Oh, please, please, please.

[WADE LAUGHS]

Why, sure.

You can sit next to Hamton
and Uncle Stinky.

Yay! Welcome aboard, Plucky.

Hi, Hammy.

[PLUCKY SNIFFING]

[STINKY GRUNTING]

Put her there, Uncle--



WADE: Alrighty rainy roo,
next stop, Happy World Land.

ALL:
Yay!

<i>On Babsy Bunny's heart</i>

<i>It's time to apply zinc oxide</i>

[IN BRITISH ACCENT] Here's the world-famous

She has her fabulous beach chair...

...and her fabulous view
of the French Riviera.

Ah.

How does she do it?

It's a toon thing.

Ah.

Roasting in the sun.

What a catastrophe it would be
if it all suddenly came to an end.





[BABY CRYING]

MOTHER:
Buster Bunny...

...don't you dare squirt Babs
with that water pistol inside the burrow.

That kind of thing is for outside play.



Aha.

Over here, Barbara Anne Bunny.

BABS:
Don't call me that!



Do your ears look better dry or wet?


One more time.

Kick and breathe and kick and breathe.


You're not gonna learn anything
floating at the bottom of the pool.

Gangway. Coming through. Pardon me.

BABS:
Oh, great. Just what I need.

Hey, Miss Bunny-Head-Head,
that's my baby kitty poolie-woolie.

I want it.

You want it?

I do, I do, I do!

BABS:
It's all yours, sister.

[CAT SCREECHES]

Come back!

We've got skydiving lessons at 4!

BABS: I'll get even with Buster
if it's the last thing I do.

[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

[CONTINUES LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

Water! Water! Water!

[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

Perhaps I've gone too far.

But Buster will get drenched for sure.

I wouldn't say that.


BUSTER:
Ha, ha. And now for the coup de grÃ¢cey.




Now, where'd he get to?


I do this water thing to Babsy
throughout the entire video.

Uncle?

Uncle.

Something's on my foot.


It's the creeping unknown!

It's not of this earth!

Buster, you've got to save my foot.

It's my lucky rabbit's foot.

It's Byron.

BABS:
Who knew?

-So how do we stop this thing?
-We don't.

BABS:
So long, Acme Acres.

BUSTER:
Hello, adventure.

Mondo distress signal.
Buster and Babs are, like, in peril.

I'd rescue them
if I didn't have this summerjob.

Hey, Shirley.

How's about going
to the dadgum movies with me?

Like, go bowl for dollars.

[ALL CHATTERING]

Huh?

[ALL GROAN]

[ALL GROAN]

All my life, I have had but one dream.

To meet Johnny Pew,

Hmm. Let me get a clear look at your aura.

I'm getting something.

Johnny Pew is heading
toward the Acme Resort Hotel.

[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]

FIFl:
I am coming to you.

Come on, Shirl.
Let's take in a dadgum flick.

Not now.


Why the bummer vibes, Dizzy?

In summer, Dizzy shed.

If Dizzy spin, Dizzy be naked.

You need to get in touch
with your feelings, Diz.

Don't deny your inner self.

Spin for the sheerjoy of spinning.



Check out the dude in the box.

Must be the new trend.

New trend? How very.

The box look is in.

SKATER:

Uh, call me picky, but isn't that song actually
"A hundred bottles of beer on the wall"?

We don't drink in our family, Plucky.

Uh, hey, is it just me or is it hot in here?

How about a little a.c., huh?

Air conditioning wastes gas.
I'll just crack a window.

Don't you dare, Wade. People will think
we can't afford air conditioning.

No. But if you're bored,

There's a--

Whoops.

[PIGS LAUGHING]

-Shoot me.
-Ooh, a tunnel.

Everybody hold your breath
in the tunnel and make a wish.

I can't make it.


I miss school.

[PIGS LAUGHING]

Oh, I love that game.


Gee, Plucky,
I guess you didn't get your wish.

Yeah. Hey, neither did you guys.

Sure we did.

We made the same wish we always do.

ALL: To be a happy and loving family

Oh, rapture. Oh, pure joy.

Oh, for the love of Norman Rockwell

Hey, the game's over, Uncle Stin--

Speak to me, Plucky.

Auntie Em, is that you?

You know, Buster, I think we've gone

Oh, relax.

Good evening, ladies.

Look, they want us to stay for dinner.

I am Michelle Lovitz, Johnny Pew's agent.

Ooh, good idea.

Mm. Yum.

Mayo and cream cheese on white

My favorite.

They bring their own food to the drive-in.

Are you sure you don't want anything else?

Why, yes. I'd like ajumbo cheeseburger,
chili fries, a cherry pie-- Unh.

Thanks, miss. We're fine.

Well, if I can't stuff my face,
I'll feed my intellect.

Comic books.

Look, Hammy,
here's the cream of my collection.

A pristine, mint-condition first printing
of <i>lmmature Radioactive Samurai Slugs.</i>

Number one.

Oh, now, Plucky, we don't allow Hamton
to read comic books on family trips.

Sheesh.

Typical parents, convinced comics
will sap a kid's cerebellum.

Ooh. A Fourth of July wedding.

How romantical.

Now, which one of you
hasn't been married for a while?

Now, simmer down, dumplings.

You'll all marry this one.

I'll get the wedding rings.

-I'll get the oven ready.

I can't marry all three of them.
That's bigamy.

No. That's big of me.

Well, a shack full of fireworks.

Isn't that convenient?

"Dearly beloved,

I am authorized

...to offer you, at no charge whatsoever,
a free fireworks demonstration.

Nice dress. Make it yourself?
Here you go. Greetings, Godzilla.

Looking kind of peaked there, son.

You took long enough.

I was enjoying watching you sweat.

We got snappers and bangers
and poppers and crackers.

We got them Roman candles,
yucky curly snaky things...

...and the little spinny whirlibobs
that never work.


[BABS LAUGHS]

Are you married? Hmm?

Sure am.

Meet the missus.

Woof.

If you'll just step this way for a ringside seat.

No need to shove.
Plenty of room for everyone.

Now, let's see.

Here's Acme Acres
and here's Happy World Land.

[STINKY LAUGHING]

And here's us,

Now, if we proceed due east
along this frontage road...

...then hang a left at Beloit...

...and jog northwesterly along Route 647

...that will put us into Happy World Land
at, oh, roughly, April 6th, 2021.

WADE:
I know the way, Plucky. Thank you.

Heh. Are you always so needy?

I've seen this flick a hundred
dadgum times, Shirl. You'll love it.

Oh, no, not you again.

Okay, you save the seats, Shirl.
I'll snag the dadgum snacks.

All right, move it, big butt. Coming through.

Honey, what do you want?

Ha, ha. He called me honey. Let's see.

I'll have one giant dadgum popcorn,
two wieners, hold the dadgum mustard.

Hmm. Goobers or Raisinets?
Goobers or Raisinets?

Heh. Ain't that the eternal question?

Guess I'll never know the eternal answer.

Shirl! Shirl! Ah.

Pardon me. Gangway.

Excuse me, you walking area code.
Could you move your--?

Ow. Dadgum it. Excuse me. Ooh.

Dadgum it.

You rude dadgum. Hmm.

Cheap way to get snacks, though.

I've seen this a hundred times.
There's Horatio, the skunknophobe.

MAN:
Shh. Come on. Down in front.

Okay, look, Shirl,
Horatio is about to get a dadgum flat tire.

-Shh.
-"Shh" yourself!

[BLOWS RASPBERRY]

Okay, Horatio is terrified of skunks, right?

Watch what happens when he gets out
to change his dadgum tire.


<i>Oh, no, a skunk.</i>


You think it's a real dadgum skunk.

-But it's only the stinky state trooper again.
-Grr.

-Fowlmouth, pipe down.
-See?

Only a dadgum state trooper.


Happy?

<i>Ah. Nothing like cool, fresh well water.</i>

FOWLMOUTH:
Look out, Horatio!


That scene really scared me
the first time I saw it.

That's it. I'm moving.

-Don't forget to write.
CROWD: Shh!

Oh, you just missed
the best part of the movie.

[CROWD GROWLS]

[ACTORS CHATTERING]

[ALL CHEERING]

Oh, it's Johnny Pew.

Gee, may I have your autograph?

Ha, ha. Sure, babe.

Thanks.

That was my photograph.
I cannot believe you.

Yeah, well, I am pretty unbelievable. Heh.

You are nothing
but a selfish, worthless waste of skunk.

You, Monsieur Pew, stink!

[ALL CHEERING]

Ooh. I got myself a kitty.

Hello, my stinky kitty-head.
Say hello to Mommy Elmyra.

Oh, no!

Oh, yes.

I'm gonna change your diapers
and give you a bath...

...and even potty train you,
you stinky kitty-faced man.

[YAWNS THEN GRUNTS]

We're still downriver and I'm still soaked.

BUSTER: You know, you look kind of pretty
there standing in the rain.

I love the way the wind rustles
through your ears...

...and that shine the water makes
on your fur.

And your uncanny resemblance
to a drowned rat when you get drenched.

Drowned rat, huh? I'll show you.

Buster, this trip downriver
has been truly special.

Downright Twainian
in a Hitchcockian sort of way.

But I miss my family.

I miss performing.

I miss being dry!

I wanna go home to Acme Acres.

[STEAMBOAT WHISTLING]

BUSTER:
Maybe that steamboat will give us a lift.

Ahoy! Avast!

Uh, shiver me timbers
and all that nautical talk.

They don't see us.

BUSTER:
Jump!

Babs, grab the lifesaver!

Who can think of candy at a time like this?

Oh.

Are you okay?

Yeah. That was a close one, right, Byron?


Well, what have we here? Stowaways?

I'm Captain Tupelo Toad.

Now, I don't cotton to stowaways
aboard my good ship <i>Delta Burke.</i>

Call me kooky,
but that sounds like a song cue to me.

<i>On the good ship Delta Burke</i>

Rope it in, kooky.

That little lady is just what we need
for our big show.

-Show? Did you say show?
-Uh, thanks...

...but Babsy here is anxious
to get home to Acme Acres.

Ah, Ricky, I wanna be in the show.

I think we can make some sort of deal here.

HITCHHIKER:
I hate duck too.


PLUCKY:
Dad. Oh, Dad. Wade. Mr. Pig.


This is as far as we go, son.

HITCHHIKER:
Where's the duck? Here duckie, duckie, duckie.

Now, remember,
if you're ever in Acme Acres...

...drop by and we'll chew the fat. Ha, ha.

Little pig joke there.

Hasta lumbago.

Die, piggy swine!

Such a nice young man.

Real straight-arrow type.

Did you have a nice talk
with our guest, Plucky?

[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

Plucky? Wake up. We're almost there.

-Heaven?
-Not quite.

But it's the next best thing.

Happy World Land.

Happy World Land? We made it!

Whoopee! Yahoo! Mwah, mwah, mwah.

WADE:
Everybody smile.

WINNIE:
Have you ever seen such a big parking lot?

PLUCKY:
Ooh.

I'm gonna go on every ride till I barf twice.

Now, hold your horses, Plucky.

We've got to capture this Kodak moment.

Excuse me, young man.

Would you mind getting a few pictures
of the family?

Uh, yeah. Um, yeah. Um....


Hold it. We're forgetting our happy caps.
Okay.


WORKER: Cheese.
ALL: Cheese.

WADE:
Thanks.

Uh, don't mention it.

-Okay, Mom.

But we didn't do anything.

All we did was ride around
on the monorail.

Don't wanna overdo it the first visit, Plucky.

Think what we'll have to look forward to
the next time.

What? But we didn't-- We came all that way.

Don't we even--? Rides. Fun. Pixies.

[AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING]

We're here.

Hi, fun seekers. You know,
Babsy and I thought it would be fun...

...to tell you how we spent
our summer vacation riding down the river.

Hey!

<i>And we were rowin', rowin'</i>

<i>Rowin'down the river</i>

These are the jokes, folks.

Feel free to laugh any time, or not.

Babs. Ahem.

-Hello?
-I'm trying to talk to the folks here.

-I'm done.
-Positive?

-Check.
-Honest?

-You betcha.
-Okay.

<i>Down by the riverside</i>

That's it. I have had it.

I am trying to talk to the people here,
and all the time you keep interrupting...

...with your dumb songs and comments
and shtick and I don't know what else.

I don't know why I put up with this.
All I am trying to do...

...is tell one simple story.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

Is that so much to ask?

-Are you done?
-I guess.

-Sure?
-Yeah.

Good. So Buster and I decided to spend
our whole summer going down the river.

It was lots of fun at first but--

[AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING]

[ORCHESTRA PLAYS FLOURISH]

Thank you.

Sounds like a terrific audience.

A lot nicer than some of the creeps
we met on this trip.

You said it. Let's turn up the house lights
and get to know each other better.

Lookie, girls, it's our beau with no pants.

Yoo-hoo!

-Possums.
-Gators.

-Dinner theater.
-Main course.

Hey, Byron can fly.

Who knew?

First one to find them

[LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

Welsh rabbit.

Oh, no, one of those possums.

Oh, shoot. Don't fret none, missy.

I ain't like my simple backwoods cousins.

I'd never eat a guy who could play his face.

See, Babsy, I told you music
was the universal language.

And here I thought it was Esperanto.

So long, sayonara, and good riddance.

At least I'll never
have to live through that again.

Hold on there, Plucky.

You haven't seen the slide show of our trip.

Slide show?

WINNIE: Ooh, there's that bathroom
at that motel we stayed at in Yorba Linda.

HAMTON:
It was so clean.

[STINKY GRUNTING]

There's that nice young man we met.
