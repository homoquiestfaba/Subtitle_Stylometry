Things are going to be different now.

Are they?

I'm going to take care of you.

No more hospitals,

no more nightmares.

Just you and me together forever.

I want you to feel good about who you are.

I want you to feel safe.

Not a very clinical thing to say, Doc.

I must sound like I'm completely crazy.

Maybe you're just a good liar.

And what have I done?

That's not me anymore.

That's all in the past.

Past, present, future.

It's all in your head.

It's not the same, it's not,

it's not real.

It's not, it's not real.

It's not real.

Where, where, where is my daughter,
is my daughter, where is she?

She's all alone.

In a dark, lonely place.

Where is this dark, lonely place?

Time.

She's very scared.

Let's just get on with this.

Where is she?

You're a psychic, you're a psychic,
where is she?

I can see her now.

In the bright, white room.

I thought you said a dark, lonely place.

Time change things.

She's gone.

Gone?

What, what do you mean she's gone?

Lucille, that was my name.

Wait, no. No, no, no.

What's happening, happening,

this is very,
this is very, very, very bad. Please.

Yes, it is.

It is very, very bad for you.

My brother died when I was ten.

Daddy never forgave me.

And it begged the question,
when innocence is lost, what's left behind?

I just want to go home.

I want to go, want to go, want to go home.

Some call it a curse.

I call it inevitable.

I don't want to die.

I don't want to die.

I got a family.

I got a family,
I have children for Christ's sakes.

Pull me up, please, I,

I've got the money, you know. I,

I, we could work something out you guys.

Thomas.

He had me committed
to save me from myself.

Never told his boss.

It's the one piece of information
that could save his life.

Sid, hired muscle,
but it gets more complicated.

We know, that's why we're here,

that's why you're hanging over the edge
of this fucking building.

Antoine's a goon.
Frankly, it doesn't get less complicated.

Here, it's for you.

You lousy rat piece of fucking shit.

You think you can steal from me?
Listen, please, please, this...

Do you think you can steal
from me and get away with it?

I, I swear to god I didn't...
Shut up.

Shut the fuck up.

I trusted you,

and you violated that trust.

Now I'm going to punish you.

I don't even care where the money is.

I don't care where the money is.

I don't give a fuck about it.

You can keep it.

Oh, no.
Merry Christmas.

Have fun, spend it in hell mother...

How, how'd it go?

guys, just call him back,
call him back, please.

What for?
He's fucking done with you, buddy.

If you want to talk to me, you want to...
There is fucking nothing

that's going to make us...

No, I swear to god, I swear to god,
you want to talk...

Are you fucking calling him?
Yeah, I'm kind 0f curious to what he has to say.

Cocksucker.

What?

Mr. Van Sant,

I, I know where she is,

You know. Yeah, I got your attention now,
don't I?

Where? Where? Where is she?

No.

No, no, you, you got to, you got to
get these guys to let me go first.

I just let you go, didn't I? I said, fine.

If I didn't, I meant to. You can go.
Where is she?

No, no,
I'll tell you as soon as you let me go.

No deal.

I'll let you go...

What?

when you tell me where she is.

Shit.

Okay, okay,

I'll tell you what, um, um, uh, okay,
then why don't I tell you,

and then you let me go?

Whoa.

Conrad.

Hey, Antoine.

What are you doing here?

Came to see this fucker off.

Well how the fuck did you find us?

Van Sant told me where you guys were.

He wanted to make sure
the job got done right.

He didn't say nothing to us.

This idiot,

he works for us for ten years,
then he steals a shit load of money,

and then has the audacity to
try to bribe me with it.

Well I'm surprised you didn't take it.

He didn't offer that much, did you?

So

back off,

let me put one in him.

Whoa, whoa, Conrad, fuck man,
take it easy.

Hey, you know the rules, homes.

What rules?

We find him, we get to kill him.

Really?

Hey, hey, Conrad,

look how, how about 50 percent, huh?

Fuck you.

Okay, 75 percent, okay?
I need some for the girl.

Do I look like I could give a shit
about some girl?

Okay, uh, g0 percent?

g0 percent.

Hey, that's some fucked up shit, homes.

Alright, dickhead,

take their guns.

What, what? What?

Come on.

Dude.

Bring them to me.

Hey, okay.

He doesn't pack.

Get over here.

Eat death!

Hey, man, that's my fucking gun.

I can't get a clear shot.

I can't get a clear shot.

Ow, shit.

Oh, fuck.

Damn it.

Ow.

Yeah, right, so what?
You guys are going to kill me?

I don't think so.

What?

Get the...
fellas, come on, I told, I told you,

okay, okay, a hundred percent,

I'll give you a hundred percent.
Shut up.

I, I know where the girl is.

She's in the Patton State Hospital.

For every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

What goes around comes around.

When people try to help me,

they die.

Angel.

How you doing, my brother?

Good, nice to see you, man.
Care to join us?

Good. I like what you've done
with this place, man.

This is really, really nice.

Oh, man, we trying to take it
to the next level, baby.

Yeah, so, Mary.

Hi.

Anne, Jeanette, Lisa.

My girls, what do you think?

I'll take all of 'em.

I'll be right back.

Who the fuck are you?

Whoa, huh?

You got a problem?

I got a problem with you and this low rent
whorehouse you're running, here.

So you pay the whores to mingle
with the customers,

and make sure that they get lucky?

That's ingenious.

You're so cute...
Hey, Jaymee girl.

So, uh, who are your friends?

Well, um, this is Frankie,
and this is Jay.

Would you?

For real?

Come on.

You mind telling me where you're going?

Hey, Angel.

I was just getting some air.

Those guys was watching your ass
practically all night, huh?

They think I'm an easy score.

Nadine.

I just can't do this anymore, okay?

I just want to go back and

finish school.

And this is,

this is just too hard.

So stop crying.

It's messing your makeup up.

Angel,

can I do something else for you?

I know I can do anything you want,
I just,

I can't, I can't take this anymore.
Please.

Please, let me do something normal.

I understand.

But until I get a fresh bitch
around here,

I got to get my money.

I need you.

We'll talk about this later, alright?

What's happening?

Where the fuck are you?

You know where I'm at, I'm working.

What happened to coming over?

I'll come by tomorrow,
I'm busy right now.

Fuck that shit, you're always busy,
you're such an asshole.

I'll talk to you later.

Fuck.

Angel and Daddy used to work together.

Apparently one of them
developed a conscience.

Nobody knows which one.

Good job today.

Glad both those fuckers are dead.

But I have something
I need you to do for me

more important than anything
I've ever asked you to do before.

I need you to find somebody for me.

She's a plague to humanity.

Poisonous. A curse to my own existence.

A curse to your own existence?

A curse, a curse, okay?

A curse.

I'd still have a son
if it weren't for this, for her.

She, on the other hand, was a,

well actually a fucking lousy accident.

She's your daughter.

No shit, you dumb motherfucker.

You've been listening.

So you want us to knock off our daughter.

What kind of person do you think I am,
have my own daughter killed?

Have her found, she escaped.

Escaped from where?

The institute. The institute.

Why do you think I'm still alive, huh?

Well I won't be for long if you guys
don't find her and keep her away from me.

Please.

Just remember, don't help her.

If you do, you die, okay?

And you won't see it coming.

We already know she was at the institute.

They don't have much there anymore.

The psycho doctor that boosted her,
he took most of the files on her,

but they can probably
dig up a picture or two.

I burned the ones I had.

Psycho doctor?

Oh, Jesus Christ,

what is wrong with you?

What, are you a cop or something?
Why all the questions?

You guys going to sit around all day
asking stupid questions

or are you going to find her and help me?

Wait, wait a minute.

You want us to walk around
with a picture of your daughter

asking people where we could find her?

I mean, she could be in a basket
for all we know.

First of all,

I always leave that part up to you guys,

that's what you do.

Now like I said,

she isn't far from the hospital,

so just keep her away from here.

That's all we have to go on?

I mean, what is her name?

Her name's Lucille.

Just follow the trail of bodies.

Oh, no,

you'll see.

Welcome to now.

Hey, what can I get you?

We got a two drink minimum.

If there really is such a thing.

Sid no longer works for Daddy.

He tends bar at a gentleman's club.

I'll Just think about it.

No way.

Not a gentleman in sight.

They call it Toxic.
I've been called worse.

um, okay, uh,

double vodka.

Three limes.

How long you been working here?

uh, not long.

Do you want to keep it open, Gus?

um, yeah.

Yeah, keep it open.

Hey.

Hey.

What's your name?

Sid.

unbelievable.

Hey buddy, let's go.

Time to go.

You driving home?

I'm fine.

Yeah, well you go be fine somewhere else.
Let's move it.

I have to get my card.

Yeah, you can get that tomorrow.

Let's go, come on.

Have a good night.

Bye bye.

Hey, babe.

Hi.

Let me help you there.

Thanks.

Simon.

Sir?

I need you to drive Rizzo tonight.

Yeah, where to?

Sherman Oaks, she knows the address.

This better be quick, Steve,
I have class in the morning.

That all depends on you, doesn't it?

Come on, fuck wad.

How's everything working out?

Oh, it's great. I,
I can't thank you enough, Steve.

Steve found a transient.

He said, 'where we're going,
you can be anyone you want from now on.

What should I call you?
The transient replied, 'Sid.'

Yeah, well,
what can I say? I got a big heart.

And an even bigger cock.

Can you close up on your own tonight?

uh, yeah, absolutely.

Good,

good night.

Hey, Sid.

That was a great show you had tonight.

Thanks.

Apparently you're
the only one with that opinion.

No, that's cool, you can keep it.

Are you sure?

Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

Alright, then,

how about a drink?

So, is it true?

You live in the attic?

um, well yeah, just for now.

Steve's sort of helping me out,
he's been a good guy.

Oh, yeah, Steve,
he's a real fucking saint.

Saint Steve.

Well, to Saint Steve.

Most people are haunted by their past.

Everyone else fears the future.

The only place to hide is in the present,

where no one's looking.

What?

Where?

I see her, shut up.

Shh, shh, shh.

It's gonna be okay.

I brought you something.

Something to keep you warm.

What's your name?

They call me Little Joe.

Little Joe.

Lucille.

You smell so good.

Your hair is so beautiful.

Oh, I've been waiting to
get you up here all night, Nadine.

Nadine, Nadine.

So fine, so young, and so clean.

Oh, goddamn.

Oh. God, you're so beautiful.

It's better then...

Oh, ah, baby that was amazing.

Here you go, baby.

You could leave if you want.

This is my room.

Oh,

okay.

Stay, then.

Just follow the trail of mice.

You'll see.

The sooner you guys get the fuck going,

the sooner you'll find her.

Ta-ta.

What the fuck was that?

That boy has lost it.

We need to find new fucking jobs.

Yeah, maybe I'll open a flower shop.

Let's go, Brokeback.

We got to find this Lucille bitch.

Bitch.

Hello?

Are you okay?

Are you okay?

What are you,

what are you doing here?

Did you sleep here last night?

Do you have anywhere to go?

God.

You are beautiful.

I think I can help you.

But I can introduce you to someone,

he can give you a place to stay.

All we have to do
is just clean you up a little bit.

Let's go introduce you to Angel,

he's going to love you. Come on.

Go on, take your shower right here,

I have some clothes for you on the dresser
so you'll be alright.

Come on, this is all you have?

One lousy fucking photo?

You can't keep that,

you're not even supposed
to be looking at that.

Give me that.

Jesus Christ.

Yeah, thanks for nothing.

But it's only a matter of days.

For who?

Me or her?

Both of you.

Or maybe just one of you.

Hard to say.

What should I do?

Should I have her, you know...

You must find her first.

Okay, what do I do when I do find her?

Huh?

All I know is that, uh,

in a matter of days she'll be no more.

So I find her,

off her,

no more curses.

Really?

Maybe it means you'll find her,

off her,

and in the process fulfill the prophecy.

They're coming in contact to her now.

Seriously, Lena, you,

some of the things you say actually
do sound like you're full of shit.

I'm asking a serious question,
what do I do when I do find her?

We don't know, we find her.

That simple.

Sid,

do you have any idea why
my office smells like a frat house?

Yeah, I spilled a beer last night.

What were you doing up there?

I couldn't sleep,
I was just watching some TV.

There's no cable.

I know, I...

Don't go up there after hours, alright?

I'm trusting you by letting you stay here.

You don't want to break my trust,
you understand?

Yes.

Now get in there and do whatever
you can to get rid of that smell, it stinks.

She is raunchy, she is racy,

and she goes by the name of,
please give it up for Raven.

Hey, Sid,

what do you think about?

Think about what?

When you're all alone at night,
you're in the shower,

where does your mind take you?

I don't have a shower, Gus.

Hey, sweetie, how you doing?

Hey, I'm doing great.

Listen, I'm a little busy right now, okay?
Thank you.

I think about a girl, too.

One that I knew not too long ago,

and that I lost.

What are you going to do about it?

Well,

I guess when the time's right,

I'll find her when she's ready to be found.

What's up, Doc?

Do I know you?

No.

Greg.

Gus.

Why do you call me Doc?

Too many Bugs Bunny cartoons
growing up, I guess.

Is that alright with you, Chief?

uh, why don't you give this guy a drink.

Put it on my tab.

You know what I dig about this place?

How fucking pathetic they all are.

Look at her,

she's up there teasing all those little
puppies around the stage.

All the while

she's pretending to be in control.

Pretending to have all the power,

you know?

She needs those sick-ass mamas' boys
more than they need her,

and deep down she knows it.

And if you look really close,

I mean past the bullshit,

you catch one of them off guard,
look them deep in the eye,

you'll see something.

You'll see misery.

You'll see their souls, man.

Their filthy,

decaying souls.

It's fucking beautiful, man.

Greg,

I don't know what happened to you
when you were just a little boy

and your mommy messed around
with your head,

but it ain't that stripper's fault, okay?

Don't talk about my mother, faggot.

Okay, I got to go to the washroom.

Are you okay?

Did you see that?

See what?

The light.

The light going on like that.

Yeah, you fruit loop,
you just turned it on.

Michelle, don't.

There is nobody in there.

Sit down?

Sure.

Something happened here.

Something awful.

What are you talking about?
What happened?

I don't know yet.

I think it involved a girl.

What girl?

Last night

I saw her,

I touched her.

Alright, you're really starting to scare me.
What the hell are you talking about?

Did you hurt someone, Sid?

No. I didn't hurt anybody.

But somebody did.

Okay,
are you sure this wasn't just a dream?

No.

It wasn't a dream.

Alright, I think maybe
you just need to get some sleep.

I'm going to go.

No, please,

Michelle, please,

don't go.

I really don't want to be alone right now.

You know when I have to go.

See you in the morning.

What's your specialty?

What you got going on, babe?
You don't know what I'm going to do.

I want to come in.

Let me in, I want to come in.

Let me in, I want to come in.

What do you want?

What the fuck is this?

Yo, we paid the fucking bitch.

Who the fuck you think you talkin'... Yeah?

Motherfucker,
you want some money? Huh?

You want some money?

No, no, don't put her on my couch.

She's just going to get blood
all over my couch. Oh, my god.

Just go get the medical kit, okay?

Oh, god.

You gonna be okay.

Where am I?

Don't worry about it, you're safe, alright?

They're coming for me, I got...

Who's coming?
What the fuck did you do, Angel?

I'm not gonna let nothing happen to you,
alright?

They're coming. They got...

I told you, you safe, alright?

Daddy. Oh, my god,
and you say I'm crazy? Jesus.

Who is Daddy?

He's Daddy.

What is his real name?

Jake Van Sant.

Who the fuck is Jake Van Sant?

Don't go there!

Angel.

I'm not going back, I'm not, I'm not.

Yeah, you know where to find
Jake Van Sant?

Shh.

I, I, I need to calm down, now.

Make a note of that. I need to calm down.

Why should I do that?

uh, just watch me.

Look.

At what?

This is her.

At the cards, or at... This is her.
Both.

This is the what?

Shh. Listen.

What do you want?

Do you believe in ghosts, Rosemary?

Honey, the only ghosts
I believe in are the Father,

the Son and the Holy Spirit.

Mmm, and that Patrick Swayze.

Can't even look at pottery
no more without getting all wet.

I'm serious.

Have you seen a ghost, child?

She's something. It's like a,

it's like a nightmare and it doesn't care
whether I'm awake or asleep.

Hmm.

I don't know, I must sound
like I'm completely crazy or something.

And here I thought
I was the freak of the street.

Honey, you want my advice?

You never let no dead bitch tell you
what to do.

Them's words to live by.

That bitch ain't got done everything
she wanted to get done before she kicked it,

then that's her problem, it's not yours.

Maybe she should have been watching
little less TV and done a little more living.

'Cause if you die tomorrow you
don't want to be one of them assholes

of the afterlife scaring some hard working,

decent people into doing some bullshit

that you should have been doing
before you kicked it.

Now I say fuck that post-mortem ho.

Now she got a problem with that,

you tell her to come haunt Rosemary
for a day.

She be going back to hell so fast her hand
basket will have a hard time keeping up.

Yeah, thanks.

Now don't mention it, honey.

So you sure you ain't up
for a little taste while we're here?

Get a room,
Rosemary make you feel real nice.

Got a lot of tricks in my tickle trunk.

Yeah, well, I don't know that.

I'll see.

I hope so.

What happened to you?

I had a very strange evening.

um, excuse the mess.

You live here?

Yeah, like it or not,
it's home for right now.

No, I like it, it's nice.

Thanks.

Come here, let me see your head.

Who did this to you?

Well, what? Some homeless person
attack you or something?

No, it was her.

The girl, Lucille.

Well the, the scratches were, anyways.

Come on, Sid, what is this?

Some kind of cry for help?
I want to help you, I do.

But fuck, what are you doing?

I don't know.

Look,
it's almost six o'clock in the morning.

Why don't you just stay here

and we'll try and figure
this all out tomorrow, okay? Deal?

I didn't ask for this.

I want it to go away more than
anything in the world.

But I don't know how to make it.

Look, I just have a hard time
believing all this.

I don't care if you don't believe me.

You're the only person I can trust.

Just, please,

please, please, just help me.

I think Steve might be involved and,

can we just, can we keep this a secret?

Okay, okay.

Hey, Sidney,
when's the last time you took a shower?

uh, a while.

Well we overslept big time,
so why don't you hope in with me,

it'll be faster.

uh, yeah, sure, okay.

Okay.

Oh, I'm sorry, go, get in.

Mmm, smell this.

Cucumber eucalyptus.

Did you ever use one of these?

um, no.

I can't say that I have.

Are you kidding me?
Turn around, turn around.

What's the problem?

I can't do this.

Why?

Because I have a daughter,
I have responsibility.

Come on, let's just clean your head, okay?

Are you sure nobody's going to notice?

Positive.

And why do you care?

I mean, it's better than having these welts
on your head.

Do you really want to explain it
to every asshole who orders a drink?

No, that's a good point.

How about some lipstick?

No way.

Huh uh, not on your life.

Oh, come on, just a little.

So, anybody need a ride tonight?

You know, anywhere?

Simon,

if we need something, Steve will tell you.

How much you guys get for that?

For what?

Well that shit
I'm always driving you to and from.

Why?

You looking to get in on the action?

Well, kind of, yeah.

uh, you know, what's Steve's take?

Like, I'd take, like, half of what he takes.

You just have to give me a, a freebie

like twice a week, each of you.

Oh, Riz, Simon wants to be
a discount pimp. Shh.

So?
Hey Steve-O,

Simon wants to be our pimp.

No, Steve, no.

Yeah, go ahead you fucking piece of shit.

You're late, both of you.

Sorry, Steve, late night.
Time to keep the customers waiting.

You, go get dressed and shut
that smart mouth of yours.

Not so fast, fuck head.

I had a visit from the police this morning.

Apparently some moron
ran out of here screaming,

left the fucking doors wide open.

Any idea who that would be?

Steve, I'm sorry.

Don't fucking sorry me, Sid.

I know you got problems and shit,
and I'm trying to help you out.

But we've all got problems.

Right now my biggest one is you.

This kind of business I'm running here,

I can't afford to have the cops
come in here checking on me,

you know what I mean?
Yeah.

I also can't afford to have
a fucking lunatic living here,

leaving the fucking doors wide open

so any one of these billion Mexican fucks
that this city's crawling

with can cha-cha their cajones in here
and bandito my shit.

You know what I'm saying?

Yeah.

You used your get out of shit free card.

Next time, just do your fucking job.

Now fuck off.

What are you doing here?

It's Friday.

Yeah, I know it's Friday,

but it's one o'clock in the afternoon.

Not the weekend.

It's a long weekend.

I had a half day today.

Monday and Tuesday off.

For what?

Parent-Teacher Conferences.

I assume you weren't planning
on attending.

I didn't know I was invited.

Where's Debbie?

In the car.

What do you want me to do? I'm working.

Is that what you call this?

Could you please just take her
to my mother's?

God forbid you're only daughter
should interfere

with this wonderful lifestyle of yours.

I'm really not in the mood for this.

In the mood for what?

Motherhood?

She hates your mother's house.

She's bored.

Although she still prefers it to
that roach nest you live in.

She begged me all the way here
not to make her go and stay with Mommy.

You're a fucking asshole.

Michelle, what are you doing here?

I'm doing the best I can.

I'm giving you a chance for a normal life.

I don't want any part of a life
that you're in.

Okay.

Then you'll get your wish.

My attorney's filing for full custody
first thing Monday morning.

What?

It's already in the works.

You can fight it if you want,

but you can't afford it,

and you won't win.

Think about it over the weekend.

Debbie will be at your mom's

if you feel like saying goodbye.

He's right.

What the fuck am I doing?

I don't deserve her.

Don't say that.

There's always a way out.

Always.

Enter.

What's up, baby doll?

Can we talk for a second?

Yeah, sure, what is it?

um,

look, I'm really sorry I was late today,

it's just that
I got a lot going on in my head and...

Spit it out, sweetheart.

I need money, badly.

And I was wondering
if maybe you could give me a loan.

And I'll pay it back
if it takes the rest of my life, I swear.

Interest or whatever. And,

Steve, you know I wouldn't come to you
unless it was life or death.

Well how much?

Five thousand.

Five...

what do you need that for?

So I can retain a lawyer,

so I don't lose my daughter.

And when do you need it by?

Monday.

Jesus Christ, Michelle, how you going
to pay that kind of money off?

It's not exactly
like you're working Vegas in here.

I know, but Steve, you know me.

You know I'd do whatever it takes.

I never thought
I'd be having this conversation with you,

or at least I hoped I wouldn't.

I can't just give you the money.

If I could, I would, but

it's just my pockets aren't
that deep these days.

There's really only one way
I can see you working this cash off.

Like I said, whatever it takes.

You okay, babe?

I've been better.

Open.

It's just a Valium,
it'll help you get through.

Thank you.

Hey, you're going to be okay.

You remembered.

Yeah, of course I remembered.

Good to see you.

You see me every day, Gus.

What more can a man ask for?

You want to ride with me?

You want to start the clock right now?

Fine, fucker.

No bullshit?

No, no bullshit.

Don't forget
to lock the fucking door tonight.

It's okay.

Debbie, is that you?

Are you looking for your mommy?

Thanks for nothing.

Hey, I can't find this broad, man.

This is fucking way
beyond ridiculous, man.

I have talked to everybody
in this fucking little town,

and all we have to
go on is this fucking picture,

and a name of a girl who does not even
seem to exist in any known database.

So the way I figure it,

we just chill for a few days, man,
tell Van Sant we couldn't find her.

Yeah,
but what if the curse does come true?

First of all, I cannot believe
you're buying into this curse bullshit.

And B, if the curse does come true,

then Van Sant will be dead,
and we'll be looking for a new job either way.

I say we give it a couple more days.

They seem to think
she'd be pretty easy to find.

Okay, A,

she's not somebody
he's going to be looking for,

because he's scared
of this curse bullshit of his.

And second,

has Van Sant ever found anyone before?

No. Well,
well look for the trail of dead bodies.

Do you see any?

You see any bodies laying around here?

Just him.

Hey, you seen this girl before?

Her name is Lucille.

Hello?

Nothing.

Fuck.

It's not her.

or it's fucking raining white people.

Alright, I say we go in there.

That's it for that dude.

Hey, excuse me, fellas,

has anybody seen this girl?

Oh,

whoa, hold on for a minute.

Yeah?

Yeah, I, I think we found our Lucille.

Don't think, okay? Know.

Yo, man.

I'm on the phone.

Yeah, yeah, I think so.

Hello?

Hmm.

Yo, was that Van Sant?

You know what?

I ain't answering, any questions

until this motherfucker apologizes
for making my phone into soup.

You know how long it took me to put
those numbers in that phone?

Huh? Do you?

This is a racist thing, isn't it?

Yo, how about you
just answer the questions

before I blow your fucking head off.

See, now I know it's a racist thing.

You don't like Mexicans.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

We need this guy alive.

We need to find out where,

hey, let me give you
a lesson on interrogation, Antoine.

You point the gun to his head,

and then you ask the question.

Have you seen this girl?

Okay, now here's the tricky part.

Either he gives us the answer we want,

then if he doesn't,
you can blow his fucking head off.

Have you seen this girl?

Hey, man, I told you
I don't know where that girl at.

All I know, they told me that people
going to come around looking for a girl.

That's the honest truth.

wrong answer.

Where is she?

That's far enough.

Go, Stretch.
Come on.

It's all paid for, come on.

Heart treatment tough guy.

Shut the fuck up.

Simon!

Simon! Hey, hey!

You piece of shit.

Jesus Christ, you want to bully
these bitches up?

Get the fuck out of here.

Want me to fuck you up, bitch?

Bullshit.
Get this piece of shit out of here.

Cock sucking motherfucker.
Get lost.

Bye-bye.

Motherfucker.

What happened?

That fucking guy Greg.

Fuck,

shit.

God I promised myself I'd never do that.

What the fuck is wrong with me?

Come on, Calm down,
people do things that they regret.

Michelle.

I really don't think being happy
is in the cards for people like you and me.

I mean, are you really happy
in a place like this?

I'm happy when I'm with you.

You mean it?

Yes, I do.

I used to get deja vu when I was younger.

It's silly, but,

you know when it would happen?

When everything just goes numb

and time stands still,
and you know that you've seen that exact

image somewhere before.

I used to tell myself that
I was on the right track, you know?

I was exactly where
I was supposed to be in life.

You still get them?

No.

I don't remember exactly
when they stopped, but

probably when I gave up the notion

that we all have a purpose in life other
than to fuck and die.

What about you?

You believe in all that fatalist shit?

No.

I think we're pretty much free
to create the world we want to live in.

And I suppose the world you want to exist
in is in the attic of a titty bar?

Well, I who said your world
has to be a place?

Sometimes who can be more important
than where.

Sid, Sid, Sid, late night psychopath,
early morning philosopher.

You are some fucking enigma, baby.

Some fucking enigma.

Alright, I'm right away coming back.

No... You cannot leave me here with her,
okay?

I mean, why can't we just leave her here
by herself?

In fact, we should just let them have her.

For some reason
I don't come back and somebody else do,

then you aim the tip at their chest,
pull the trigger.

No... how am I going to know
that it's them and not you?

'Cause, I'm going to say this is Angel,

and they probably not going to do that.

We need like a special knock or something.

Alright, I'm going to knock five times,
that's how you gonna know it's me.

No, 'cause they may knock five times.

We need like, like a special knock
or something. You know,

like, like knock three times,

knock two times, and then knock once.

Alright, I got it.

I'll be back.

I love you.

Guess you didn't bring the girl, huh?

What you doing in there?

What?

You're not, uh,
you're not working for Steve yet, are you?

Yeah, of course I'm working for Steve.

So are you.

No, I mean, like afterwards.

Are you fucking kidding me?

No, uh, no,
I figure I start with one and then,

you know, then you'll see how much money

you're making 'cause my percentage
is so much less.

You know?

I figure somebody like you,

well we could make a lot of money,

you won't have to deal with
that piece of shit ever again.

What do you say?

What's so funny?

I knew it.

Knew what?

It's so obvious now.

No wonder you can't concentrate
on your job.

What are you talking about, Sid?

Well, you work at a titty bar because
you think it makes you more of a man.

That you work out
like you have something to prove.

You act like you're protecting these girls,

but when they need you most,

where the fuck are you, Simon?

Man, you're buried so deep in the closet,

man, you can't even breathe.

What the hell is going on in here?

I'm not a faggot, you little fucking bitch.

Fucker, I'm going to fucking kill you.
Hey... come here, you, get in the office.

Get in there.

Get back in the bar,
I'll deal with you later.

Now fuck off.

Hey, you...

Sid,

pack up your belongings, you're fired.

I'm sick of being a parent around here.

That's why I never had kids,
you can't fire them.

I'm sorry things didn't work out.

I wish you the best,
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

Goodbye, goodnight.

What the hell was that about?

I'm letting your little friend go.

You can't do that.

Yes I can, and I feel better already.

If Sid goes, I go.

Right.

Sid doesn't have anyone else.

Well then Sid can stay with you,
it's not my problem.

One more chance?

What the fuck? Get the fuck out of here.

I know a doctor, a shrink.

I used to send all the girls there
when their emotional problems

got in the way of their work.

His name's Doctor Zilver.

He's in Van Nuys, takes cash, I trust him.

Take Sid there,

but one more chance.

You getting soft in your old age, Steve?

Well maybe you
just don't do it for me anymore.

Right.

Oh, my future.

What, what about my future?

Your future, let's see.

I can't see it now.

What do you mean?

You can't, you don't see a future?

No future?

Time and patience.

Oh, Jesus.

Go away,

I'm busy. I'm with the president.

Hey, who the fuck are you guys?

Get the fuck out of here.

Get... I see it now.

Toxic.

Sid, it's Michelle.

Hey.

Listen to me, you were right.

I spoke with my lawyer,
and he did a little digging.

Apparently there
was a Lucille reported missing

from a psychiatric hospital
in San Bernardino.

We have to go there.

I'm on my way out there right now.

Just act normal, I'll be in on time.

I love you, Michelle.

Sid, you're cutting out.

I'll, I'll call you back on my way home.

We all must pay for our sins.

Dr. Gowman, your six o'clock is here.

Send her in.

Hi.

Hi, I'm Dr. Gowman, how can I help you?

um, my name is Michelle Pagero and

I was looking for a friend of mine,
and I was told I could find her here.

What is her name?

Her name's Lucille.

What is this about?

It's just really important that I see her.

I'm sorry.

I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

Well what about her doctor?
Are you her doctor?

No, Dr. Adderly is no longer with us.

What exactly is your relationship
with Lucille?

um, we went to high school together.

Lucille never went to high school.

Maybe it was elementary school,
who can remember?

um, when did he resign?
Was it before or after she escaped?

If you'll excuse me,
I have some work I need to attend to.

Security, would you please have
Miss Pagero escorted off the premises.

Do me a favor,

send a couple of pussy shots over
to the Chicano and the redneck.

You know, Michelle really likes you.

She's the only reason you're still here.

Yeah, I know.

Maybe she's, uh,

maybe she's right,
maybe I am a little hard on you.

That's fine.
Are we cool?

Yeah, we're cool.

Toxic.

Sid, it's me. I'm on my way back.

What happened?

I couldn't get much out of them,

but Lucille did escape.

She was there.

How the hell she made it here,
I don't know.

Maybe we should talk to Steve.

Don't come in today.

What?

Do you hear me, Michelle?

Do not come in today.

I don't care what you do,
but do not come make it in the club today.

Do you understand?

But why? What are you going to do? Sid!

I think someone's coming.

No, no, for real this time.

You're supposed to knock,
then I say 'enter.'

That's the order.

I want to talk about Lucille.

It's about time.

What about her?

You killed her.

She came to you for help,
and you killed her.

No...

Every girl that comes through
that door is given an option.

I don't take it away.

You killed Lucille, Sid.

You.

Are you Lucille?

Are you Lucille?

No.

You killed, you killed Lucille, Sid.

You, you. Not me.

We must all pay for our sins,
Steve Merchant.

Are you fucking kidding me
you crazy little cunt?

You must suffer for what you've done?

You first.

How's that?

And what have I done?

What the fuck have I done, huh?

You steal innocence.

You trade it for money.

That's all they want,

is to be happy.

Is that too much to fucking ask?

Fuck off.

All I ever did was try to help you.

Steve,

oh.

Michelle, Michelle.

What do you want?

We got to go tonight.

Look, I'm not,
I'm not going anywhere with you.

No, look,
everything's going to be different now.

Look.

Why do you have that
and why are you driving Steve's car?

What the fuck did you do?

We're free now.

Okay, we have to call the cops.

No, no.

Don't you see?

This is how we get our innocence back.

We can be happy.

Isn't that what you wanted?

Are you fucking crazy?

You think you're a man,
but you're not a man.

Look, I know.

You found her.

Fucking get off of me.

You're the doctor who was looking for her?

And I found her.

But Steve didn't kill her.

Guess that's what she wants.

You tell me what she wants,
please help me.

I'll help you,

but there's something
we need to talk about.

You're right,

there is.

What did you do to her?

All I did was love her.

Then why is she dead?

Well she's dead because
she couldn't live with what she'd done.

What are you talking about?

What are you talking about?

Now, you got to put down that gun.

I don't trust you.

There was a time
when you did trust me, Sid.

Okay? And it wasn't that long ago.

And you have to go back there.

And you have to remember that time.

Listen, I know what you're looking for,

and I have the answer.

But you have to give me that gun.

Can you do it?

Give me the gun.

Good.

Good.

Do you love her?

I love her very much.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

No,

no!

Stop, stop. Sid.

She's gone.

She's pretending to be in control.

Good girl.

Who says your world has to be a place?

I've got a big heart.

Sometimes you need something traumatic.

You get to get those synapses really fired.

Man, you're buried so deep in the closet?

Now how about a little lipstick?

Look, look, why don't you say it.

God damn it look in the mirror,
what do you see?

I see Sid.

Bullshit.

What's your name?

Sid.

He is dead.

Look, what do you see?

What's your name?

Sid.

What do you see?

What the fuck do you see
fucking right there?

What do you see?

She's pretending to be in control.

What do you see?

...and an even bigger cock.

Sometimes who can be more important
than where.

It's okay.

I lied.

The burden was still too much to bear,

so when the time was right
you simply became him.

You were living with
two very distinct identities all along.

All you did was kill the one
that brought you pain.

You traded places,

but a strong will can't
be killed off that easily.

It was that strength
that made me fall in love with you.

And things are going to be different now.

Are they?

I Don't like being me, Dr. Adderly.

I'm afraid I can't.

Well don't be afraid, just remember,

love can conquer all.

Not a very clinical thing to say, Doc.

No, that's not me anymore,
that's all in the past.

Past, present, future.

It's all in your head.

It's not the same, it's not,

it's not real, it's not,

it's not real.

We're real.

No.

It's going to be just as easy
to disappear into somebody else.

Pull over.

We're making good time.

I want you to show me.

I want to watch you disappear into me.

Okay.

Holy shit,

I don't fucking believe it.

Sid?

Is that you?

Remember me, Greg?

What the hell you doing
all the way the fuck out here?

You remember me, right?

No.

Well, that's alright.

Where you headed?

Surprise me.

Alrighty.
