UntiI I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat.

Sometimes it's like that's
the onIy reason why I hustIe,

to step on toes, strong-arm
and show a little muscle.

Ain't no reaI dough,
that's why a nigga feeIs so frustrated.

I hate it seeing bitch niggas that made it.

And I'm robbin' niggas

Fuckin' with Queens

Hi. l'm Kurt Loder with MTV news.

There have been aIarming reports
from London and Berlin

of a new form of heroin being soId
in underground hip-hop cIubs and raves

aII across Europe.

This better not be no bitch.

-Hello. What's the deal?
-Who is this?

-And who is this?
-This is Kisha.

Why the fuck are you paging my man?

Who, Tommy?

-You know who l'm talking about.
-Oh, what's up, Kish?

Yo, Tommy tells me everything about you.
What's going on?

It's reported that this heroin

is dramaticaIIy more potent
than previous forms of the drug.

So much more, the user need only
appIy the drug externaIIy on the skin

to be affected.

US DEA fears the drug
is on its way to this country

via various conduits in Jamaica
and throughout the West Indies.

We'II have more on the story as it breaks.

That's the news for now.
Stay tuned for more later here on MTV.

Cut the bullshit, all right?

but I Iove Iiving around the way.

All right, all right. lt's okay. lt's okay.

Ti? That's my girl.

and Bunds first started flippin' birds.

We had Kenya this past year.

Yo, when shit gets crazy, it's them.
They keep me sane.

He showed me how to tongue kiss
and everything.

We were like best friends.

You cannot trust him. You know that.

l keep hoping that maybe one day
he'll be more like Sincere.

You know? More into life. More into me.
You know. You have that.

Kisha, l'm gonna just be honest with you.

Tommy's not gonna be shit but what he is.

You just have to understand.

Certain types of people accept
the bad in life, and that's cool with them.

l hate to say it, but you're right, you know?

lt just hurts to be alone, you know?

And the only thing l have is fucked up.
ls that all there is?

Kisha, you got life.

You are breathing.
You're healthy. Fuck that nigga.

You don't need no nigga
to make you feel like you're whole.

But you and Sincere are so happy.

But don't mistake it.
l'm happy with Sincere because l'm happy.

lf l wasn't happy with him,
then l'd have to do what l have to do.

You have to do the same for you.

l don't know what that is.

l mean, l think you'll be all right.

You're just going to have to
take it one day at a time.

-Yeah.
-You know. That's all l can think.

But don't worry. l'm not going nowhere.
l just wanna see what's going on.

Whatever.

Fuck. No teIIin' what's going on.

Every day it's something different.
You know?

I thought it might be some beef with Kisha
or something.

But when I seen how shook he was,
I knew it was something eIse.

What's up, man?

-The fuckin' feds hit us today, man.
-What?

They got fuckin' Mark and Knowledge
out there in Omaha,

and the feds are in front
of my fuckin' crib right now.

-Oh, shit.
-They fuckin' probably got Kish, man.

This shit is crazy, man.
This stupid motherfucker, Knowledge, man.

As soon as he gets knocked,
calls my crib from out there.

What the fuck is wrong with this nigga?
That's your man.

-That's your man.
-You sure it was the feds?

Dawg, you think l don't know
the fuckin' feds when l see 'em?

Yo, you paranoid, man.

You kinda calm for somebody that's
supposed to be on the run like me, man.

Oh, come on. You think l gave you up

-All right, man. l got you.
-Yo, l gotta get the fuck outta here.

l ain't got no dough for Ox.

You gotta tell Kish what's up for me.

No doubt. Don't worry about it.
l'm gonna see you.

When it rains, niggas get wet. You know?

Dawg, you the only one
l got in my corner, man.

Don't cross me.

-l got you.
-One.

Look out, dawg. Let me get a light.

Yo, baby, shit is wicked out here.

-Nigga got problems.
-Oh, word?

Nothing that God can't solve.
What's the nigga's résumé?

Big. Some fake-ass nigga out here.

The motherfucker dropped a dime on me

I might not even see the Iight.

Enough said, son.

-Big, let me holler at you.

Hold on, homie.
Look, bitch, l'm gonna call you back.

Niggas say this motherfucker's coming

Pullin' up at every block

-He ain't sellin' nothing.

He's askin' motherfuckers about Rico.
He wanna get with Rico.

-Okay. So who with this nigga?
-He by hisself.

-The nigga by hisself?
-Yeah. Clown nigga, too.

Flossin' major chips, Rolex, everything.

Let's go see what the nigga talkin' about.

Hold up. What?

Niggas in Penn heard mad shit about you.
Everybody talkin' for real.

-Oh. Easy, cowboy.

l just came to see if we can do somethin'.

l brought a gift and the whole nine, player.

Nigga, we don't fuck with out-of-towners
especially silly motherfuckers like you.

That's peace, baby. Whatever.

Get a drink? Get some bitch ass?

Y'all niggas be safe.
Peace, peace. Word up.

Now Tommy's on the run crazy,

Robbin' niggas, drugs,
whatever to get the dough.

What the fuck you think we gonna do?
Get money.

He winds up in AtIanta seIIin' weed.

Who does he get to work for him?

You got it, Wise and Lakid.

Bunds was the best
at makin' a bad situation worse.

He wouId corrupt anyone he couId
to get over.

As Iong as he knew
how to controI niggas' minds,

he couId make shit happen anywhere.

Learn how to put the motherfuckin' weed
in the bags first.

Then get money.

lt's dough out here.
That nigga's gots to be willin' to get down.

No doubt.

-You hear the phone?
-l didn't know you wanted me to get it.

-That nigga's crazy.

Yo! Who the fuck you think

How the fuck'd you get this number?

Your bitch gave me the number.
What the fuck you talking about?

-Fuck Knowledge.

Roll up. l'm tryin' to get high.

l like your flavor. You got it locked in here.

This is live right here.
l want that one right there.

-Can l get that?
-Oh, for sure.

All right. Check this out then.

Before we break out,
l gotta holler at you before we bounce.

What's the deal?

Son, a nigga like me
want to show my appreciation.

You know what l'm sayin'?

Remember, l said l came down here
to check niggas in the whole notch

especially you, son.

l brought a present
and the whole shit from my man.

Your man? What's that?

-Knowledge.
-Knowledge?

Come on, man! Get in the fuckin' car!

The more and more
I was reading the Minister's book,

the more I reaIized how fucked up
our whoIe thought process was.

I mean, we aII have knowIedge of seIf

but stiII, we was actin' Iike fuckin' idiots.

Now, more than ever,
I couId see error in our ways.

It seemed time had flipped shit
to a new fuckin' page.

Yo, yo. Chill, chill, chill.

That nigga's fuckin' crazy, yo!

You should have seen him.
He dissed their whole click.

Now, if that was me,

l would have bodied the niggas
soon as they said somethin'.

Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
You was right there and didn't say shit.

l'm surprised you had nuts
to pull that piece of shit.

What the fuck you talkin' about?

lf it wasn't for me,

Umbrook and Casa would have
pushed your wig back, nigga. Word up.

Don't even try to front.

Yo, l seen how shook you was
when them niggas showed up.

Know what l mean?
You was prayin' shit didn't happen.

You know, l seen you after we left.
You was ready to cry like a bitch.

-Uh-huh!
-You think l ain't see that, yo?

Yo, when those niggas pulled out,
son looked mad hurt.

Know what l mean? Yo, don't front.

What, you don't want me to pull your
bitch-ass card in front of Bunds?

Fuck it. Just keep it real.

Yo, l know you not gonna let this nigga
talk to you like that. What's goin' on?

Nah, bitch nigga ain't no bitch to me.

That's what the fuck
l'm talkin' about, nigga. What?

Some real shit now. What?

Chill, chill. Bitches, chill before you
fuck around and make a mistake.

Ain't no mistakes.
This motherfuckerjust talk too much.

l had to shut him the fuck up.

After Wise got smoked,

Bunds was so drunk and high
he just stayed there,

feeIin' Iike he had enough.

And it was his fauIt that Wise got hit.

He couId have easiIy deaded
the whoIe argument.

But Bunds, he's an instigator for reaI.

So now he's like, "Fuck it."

Tommy was at the end of his rope.

Keep your arms where l can see 'em.
Cuff him.

You have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

Do you understand these rights
as l have read them?

...six nine.

T.R. Jacobs.

What's your aliases?

Sincere.

Close door!

Yo.

Collect call from
Department of Corrections inmate.

-Tommy Brown.
-Yeah, l accept.

What's up, Sin? What's goin' on?

Who this? Bunds?
What's the deal, my nigga?

Fucked up. l need some help, yo.

Yo, l told you l wasn't
fuckin' with you no more, man.

-What part you don't understand?
-Yeah, l know.

l got arrested on some bullshit last night.

l gotta get outta here
before my prints come back.

Take that shit to Ox, man. Tell him it's his.

The rest of that... l'm in Decatur, man.

Remember, dawg, you my nigga.
Don't let me down.

No doubt, baby. l got you.
Don't even worry it. Peace.

One.

Cannot believe you.

Bullshit clot...

l don't wanna watch
some bumba clot no more.

l put my trust in them.
Now we're gonna lose it.

l don't wanna watch them no more.

Sorry Ras clot, no?

l'm watching...

A bumba clot war, hmm?

Wanna ramp with me?

Come on!

Who wanna test me? Come on! Come on!

Don't know who l bumba clot ramp with.

Wanna know me?

l am the original Joliet called Dandera.
You understand?

You wanna ramp with bumba clot, eh?

Come. Come on. l murder people for fun.

Murder on a bumba clot for fun.

Come on!

Who wanna ramp with bumba clot me?

Come on!

lt's me, the bumba clot Ox!

Who wanna ramp with bumba clot, eh?

lt's me, the bumba clot Ox!

When l finally got to Ox house,
yo, there was cops everywhere.

I seen that nigga Iaid out,

the fuckin' top dog
with his throat slit from ear to ear.

Damn.

You know, l drove around Queens for,
Iike, an hour-and-a-haIf in a daze.

FinaIIy, I drove up to RochdaIe Projects.

Me and Bunds used to hang out there
back in the days.

That's where all the bitches was.

Yo, when I waIked through,
l saw my man Shorty out there pumpin'.

Shorty was, like, 12 goin' on 20.

A reaI Ioser-type nigga, you know?

No hope for the future at aII.

To him, it wasn't reaIistic that he
was ever gonna make it out the projects.

And he was right.

-What up, Shorty?
-What up?

Man. Niggas up mad early
gettin' that paper, huh?

We all got bagged.

-What happened?
-Thursday, l got bagged.

-What happened?
-Fuckin' with this nigga on the roof.

-On the roof?
-Yeah, man.

-What you was doin'?
-Shot this nigga, man.

l got it still burnin'. Shit's just gettin' hot.

See? Just gotta hold the shit down.

Know what l'm sayin'?
Got the bulletproof vest.

-Yo, damn, man.
-Shit's just hot.

Don't let these niggas out here
steer you wrong, man.

See them niggas on the corner over there?

-They're gonna be out here forever.
-All right, peace.

-Yo, man. Fuckin' with guns.
-lt's all right.

When you fuck with guns, Shorty...

lt's always the coolest niggas that
fuck around and get murdered, you know?

lt's a war out here.

Mad niggas is dyin'.

-You don't want that shit to be you, right?
-Nah.

l know you gonna hold it down, though.
You know what l mean?

Just be careful, man.

These niggas out here
ain't even really worth it.

You're an ill nigga, though.
l like your style, son.

Shorty, l'm a go, so, all right?

Look in your pocket.

That's you. That's from me, baby.

Just make sure you rise above
all this madness out here.

Mind elevation, man.

Fuck that petty shit. You don't need it.

For real. All right?

-All right.
-All right, all right. My nigga.

You're out, dickhead. Open the gate.

Bunds was an animaI out the cage, for reaI.

But he went around the way
to Iay at his stepmom's crib

and get his pIans together.

And that's where life as he knew it
came to an end.

All right. All right, here we go.

Yeah. Right there. Try that one on.

There it is, man.

What's you, a coach or somethin'?

You ain't from around here.

l'm Roger. How you doin', Tommy?

l just came lookin' for you, man.

Lookin' for me for what?

When l heard that the police
finally had you in custody

l wanted to come down
and just meet you in person.

Don't get nervous. A lot of agents here.

What l think you should do is
just pay attention and listen to me.

Listen to what l'm gonna tell ya.

l'm gonna give you a choice, man.

-Oh, l got a choice?
-Yeah, you got a choice.

l'm gonna offer you some freedom.

You know you're in a lot of trouble.

Without us, you go to jail.

You go to jail forever. You understand?

So who l gotta blast?

He calls himself the Minister.

lt's yourjob to get into his organization
and learn his ways.

On New Year's Eve
he's having the biggest gathering,

World's Day of Reckoning,
at the Armory in Harlem.

On that very night,
you will terminate this fucker.

We'll do everything in our power
to give you all the help that's necessary.

But be warned,
we've got a lot of operatives in place.

lf you show any weakness
or if you betray us,

it'll be your resignation.

You understand?

Yeah, l understand.

Don't fuck around, Bunds.

l was thinking, l know it's your boy
and l hate to keep bringing it up,

but seriously,
we need to start thinking about us.

This shit's too dangerous now.

lt's not safe anymore.

Ti, l feel like it's time for us
to go away from here.

l been thinkin' about it for a long time.

Where will we go?

Ti, let's go to Africa.

Shit, nigga, please. Be for real.

Yo, l never been more serious in my life.

l mean, we been to the islands.
We been everywhere.

Who says we can't go to Africa?

l mean, but... l don't know.

-Africa's far.
-So what?

l'm sayin', just think about us.
That's all we ever talk about.

That's our dream, to go to our homeland
where our roots are.

Fuck it, man. You know what l'm sayin'?
Like, forget about money. Fuck everything.

lt's a chance of a lifetime.
lf me and you went, and the baby...

Just think.

Maybe it's the right thing to do, maybe not.

Well, l'll think about it.

l will think about it.

Bunds was supposed to
take out the Minister.

ApparentIy, they needed a nigga to do it
for pubIicity or somethin'.

Tommy was perfect.

He had to start from the bottom, though.

You know, reaIIy take
it serious with the reIigion.

He had to study and reaIIy be a part of it

'cause it wasn't gonna be easy
to get cIose to the Minister.

Meanwhile, Knowledge and Shameek
started scheming

on how they was gonna find Bundy,

you know, for a IittIe payback visit.

KnowIedge knew where Kisha Iived,

so he knew Tommy wouIdn't be far behind.

Oddly enough,
the more Tommy got into character

the more, you know,
the truth was Iike the Iight.

No matter what cIouds are true,
eventuaIIy the sun wiII come out

and you cannot stop the sun from shining.

For the first time
the sun was finaIIy shinin' on Bundy.

Oh, shit!
What the fuck are y'all doin' in my house?

Relax, shorty.
Nobody here to fuck with you.

Then get your stank ass out my house
and take your broke-ass niggas with you.

We just here looking for this nigga.
That all.

We was hopin' maybe Sin
could tell us where to find his ass.

Oh, shit.

Don't worry, shortstop. We're on our way.

Just tell Sin Father Sha came by. That all.

We don't want to worry the guy,
but we really need to find this fucker.

l'm fuckin' serious.

Care, my niggas.

Hey, yo, peace, shorty.

You stay cool. Don't hurt nobody.

I get a phone caII from niggas,
Iike, early this evening.

l can't believe it.
He want me to meet him up in Harlem.

I don't even know what's goin' on.
First, how the fuck he get outta jaiI?

Maybe this nigga gave me up
to get out, you know?

It couId be a setup.
You couId never teII with this nigga.

I mean, Bunds is my dawg, but this nigga,
man, is hard to teII sometimes.

He could be ill when he wanna be.

Yo, Bunds. What up, nigga?

-What scheme you up to now?
-How you doin', Sin?

l'm all right. What's up?

l been tryin' to call you.
How come you ain't call me back?

Ain't hard to tell.
My life's in a whole 'nother direction, dawg.

l could see that. Yo, you know
l'm not gonna leave you though, right?

Yo, l thought you was up the river, man.

l didn't know what to do.
l went to Ox house, yo.

Then l call Mark,
and l'm a-tell him what happened.

l didn't get no response.

Heard about Ox. Know what l'm sayin'?

But you want to know somethin' though,
Sin?

You was always right, dawg.
You know what l'm sayin'?

We was on the road to destruction
from the beginning.

Wasn't tryin' to hear it, though, you know?

But now, you know,
the Minister showed us the right path.

-Try and take that path?
-What happened to "fuck followers"

and "no purpose"
and all your issues and shit?

Listen, dawg,
we all make mistakes, especially me.

But if you've got a chance to make it right,
make it right.

l got that from you.

l feel it's the only way.

l don't feel a need to play
the whole part in the entire movement

but, yo, if you just raise your family right,
if l just live righteously,

l be all right.

Yo, my whole life is dedicated to change.

Yo, l'm goin' to Africa.

-Word?
-Word.

Africa?

Gonna take some time out
to reflect on the things that's happenin',

you know, between you, me,
the whole world.

That's ill, son. That's ill.

What can l say but,
you know, congratulations.

Good luck on your trip to the motherland.

Good luck, Bunds.

l hope everything is right with you
and the Minister as well, all right?

What you want me to do
with the car and all that?

All your shit. What you want me to do?

l ain't gonna really need none of that.
You know what l'm sayin'?

Accept it as a gift.

-Take it to the heart.
-D.

-One.
-One.

Now, remember,
the dope has to be secured in that office.

lt's extremely important
that he's found with shit on the premises.

Our people are all in place.
Spread the word.

Hey, slick.

Do not attempt to get a brain on this.
You hear me?

Under no circumstances

is the Minister to make that speech.

l want it real messy. No mistakes.

You copy that?

Yeah, l copy that.

You're my nigga, man. You're my nigga.

-Yo, Ti.
-l'm in here, Sin.

Why you sittin' over here in the dark?

What happen?

When l got home,
there was some niggas in the house.

They said they were lookin' for you.

One of 'em, he said his name was Sha.

But l think he was lookin' for Tommy.

-Did they touch you?
-No.

l got scared, so l just pulled out.

But they left quietly.
l mean, they didn't do anything.

But l've just been sittin' here.

They dead, all right?

-They are dead.
-No, Sin. Mm-mm. You gotta promise.

You gotta promise me that you'll just say,
"Fuck this shit" and leave it alone.

You gotta swear
that you will not go lookin' for them.

l can't take this shit no more.
We should just do what you said.

You forget about Tommy, forget about
all this shit and start thinkin' about us.

Let's just do what you said.
Let's just split and go to Africa.

We should just go.

-All right then.
-We should just go.

We're gonna go, okay? We'll go.

l don't know how you can stay out here.
Shit gettin' crazier every day.

Word, me, my wifey, little C,
we all out, man.

Yo, you goin' to Africa?
You gonna stop fuckin' with weed?

l don't even fuck with no more chronic.
l don't need none of that shit no more.

-This is the shit, l'm tellin' you.
-You one lucky nigga, boy.

Long-ass flight, too.
l ain't never comin' back.

That's what l was thinkin' about,
never comin' back. Word!

You my nigga, all right?
Get with you on that.

-All right. Yeah.
-Tell Chaka my love, all right?

-All right. Peace.
-Chill, nigga.

Man, it's crazy out here, man.
That's why l broke out for a minute.

-All right. Word up.
-Straight up.

-Yo, what up?
-Sin, what's up, baby?

-How you? How you been?
-l'm maintaining. Looking good.

-You got the little one, huh?
-Yeah.

-She got me baby-sittin' right now.
-That's real.

-You all right, though? Lookin' good.
-Yeah. You know how it is.

-l know it's crazy out here.
-Oh, yeah.

Yo, l'm gettin' ready to blow, dun.

-Oh, word. All right. Sure.
-Peace, man. Peace.

-What's up, baby pop?
-Yo, what up, Black? Funny-ass nigger.

-Fuck is up, nigga?
-Remember that shit from the basement?

-Stupid motherfuckers!
-Fuck outta here, yo!

Take this, man!

Ti, l got shot.

-What?
-Yeah.

Coming out the barber shop,
this nigga shot me in my leg.

-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

Oh, my God!

-l had to shoot these two other niggas.
-What?

-The nigga that shot me, l killed that nigga.
-What?

l don't give a fuck, though.
We still gonna go.

Ain't nothin' stoppin' us from leavin'.
l don't give a fuck no more.

We goin'.

-Yo?
-What up, cat daddy?

-It's KnowIedge.
-Fuck is up?

-What's the verdict?
-Biggie just got hit with some joints.

Ain't even gonna see Iife for a minute.

Damn. Yo, that nigga can't Iive, son.

You know l know where

-Yeah?
-35 Westchester.

Son, l'm a-go see that piece.

Let that bitch Tommy know
what's reaI up in the battIefieId, for you.

Get that bitch.
Bring that nigga out in the front.

No doubt. Stay up, baby.
Hold your head. One.

Come on. Let's bring it. All right!

AII praises due to the
one and true living God!

Yeah! Oh, yeah!

This is a great day today!
A great and festive day!

You are a beautifuI peopIe,

a peopIe deserving of a savior.

l want you to secure the west wing.
You two move out.

...a God who loves you and l so much

that he would
cIimb a mountain 40 miIes high

just to save one of you.

Go.

Right? He said, "Let my peopIe go!"

He said, "Wicked, Iet my peopIe go!"

He saved the day.
This time, he is right in our midst.

Who is he? Say it!

l knew you were coming

so l sent everyone away

because l believed
my final moment was at hand.

Before you pull that trigger

and take my life

l would like the chance
to tell you some things

perhaps to think about after l am gone.

Don't worry about me stallin'.

My people have orders to leave me
to my studies for another 1 5 minutes.

l will only take five.

Can you bear with me?

Will you?

Then make up your mind.

Today marks the change of not only
a new year, but a new millennium.

Take a look around.

The majority of the youth roam the streets
deaIing in drugs, sex and vioIence,

thinking these things
have no real effect on life.

Crimes without real punishment.

An uncaring, unfeeIing generation
without knowIedge of seIf.

This is the future of our nation,
the future of our people.

Do you think hatred and evil
will go unpunished?

The world is now feeling the heat

from flames it has kept burning
since the beginning of civilization.

You represent that fire.

You and l are just a small part
of God's plan.

The evil men of this world
have appIied every method possibIe

to deceive its occupants

and each time with greater success
than anticipated.

But no more.

Tonight, with this new millennium,

God will begin to overcome this evil.

I represent the truth to the peopIe.

Without truth, nothing is sacred.

The lie, that's what the devil is all about.

You know that. That's why you're here.

What the hell?

The truth is, we all play a grave role
in our own destruction.

Your money.

Your lifestyles.

The things that people value
and covet so dearly

are the bait that lures them out of the light.

Turn over, bitch.

Where the fuck is that bitch-ass nigga at?

Huh? Bitch!

Through the love of others

l have power.

The truth gives me this.

Those that fear me send you here,

here to murder all that l say.

They use what you fear against you.

Your fear of death.
Your fear of imprisonment.

Oh, shit! You fuckin'...

Where in this world
is anyone safe from death?

You see the lies you've been told?

The path you take is not your own.

Now you turn around, bitch!
Punk-ass motherfucker!

Look what you did to me!
l hate you! l hate you!

Have you ever thought about
how precious a life is?

How difficult it is to create?

How loosely and easily
it has been for you to take away?

Ten!

Brother, help me.

Nine!

Help me to do what's right.

Eight!

Help me to stop
the slaughter of our children.

-Seven!
-Help me to put an end to the disrespect

and the dishonor of our most
valuable resource, the black woman.

-Six!
-Help me to put an end

to the destruction of the young mind
through the use of drugs, alcohol.

Five!

Help me to build up
a population of great thinkers.

Four!

People who create change
through thoughtfulness and spirituality.

Three!

Will you choose that truth?

Will you?

Two!

Will you choose the light
over the darkness?

One!

Once l found out the clock was tickin'.

See the Glock. Stick it.

KiIIing, 'cause revenge
is aII they can think about in the end.

But I'm going for the binge.

Burn tiII I singe.

Fuck outta this!

FaII by myseIf, die by myseIf.

PIays the tricks.

And if you don't know
what it's goin' to be in the end...

T minus three, two, one. Amen.

-Drop the gun!
-Hold it. Stay where you are.

Will you choose life?

lt's time.

lt's time, man.

lt's time.

When I opened my eyes,
l couldn't believe it.

Africa, for reaI.

I feIt Iike I never reaIIy seen cIouds before.

I feIt Iike the sky was a different coIor bIue,

the trees a different coIor green.

And the peopIe, too.

The peopIe were beautifuI. It feIt right.

It was harmony, Iike I wasn't far from home.

Everybody together, me, Tionne, Kenya.

lt was like...
It's Iike a whoIe new beginning.

Yo. You ever been in love?

Have you ever been in Iove?

-No. You?
-No.

lt seems like...

That's right. So what you goin' do?

You know how you do it, baby.
