Michelle:
They thought he was dead.

My sister, Becky,
put me in a body bag

to protect me from the sun.

Mr. Thompson, from
the Embassy, helped her.

They were so frightened
they forgot

about the Bloodstone.

Anna: Can you hear me?

Don't be afraid.

Try to stay still.

You've had an accident.

I'm a doctor,
help is on the way.

(phone dialing)

(busy signal)

I'll take you to
a clinic myself.

(anxious instrumental music)

Doctor Nicolescu, please.

It's an emergency.

(heart rate monitor)

Doctor.

Anna Lazar is at the gate,
she says it's an emergency.

Tell the guards to let her in.

I won't do the things

that good doctors so
far from the city.

Careful! Take her
inside, quickly!

Anna! What's wrong?

Was it there an accident?

Yes! This girl was
the only survivor!

(foreign language)

This bag is for corpses.

Yes, but when
I opened the zipper

she went into a
violent paroxysm.

(gasping for air)

(frenetic instrumental music)

(moves to suspense
instrumental music)

What's wrong with her?

Anna, this is a vampire.

A vampire?

Impossible!

You'll see when
the sun goes down.

(gasping for air)
(frenetic instrumental music)

Where am I?

Please, don't be afraid.

We want to help you.

I am Doctor Lazar. Anna.

This is Doctor Nicolescu.

You were in a terrible
accident in an Embassy car

with a man and two women.

My sister.

Becky.

Where is she?

I'm sorry but...
she did not survive.

No!

Aah! Turn it off!

(Michelle screams in pain)

Anna: Please!

Can you tell us what happened?

This poor child
has been ravaged by a vampire.

A vampire?

I don't believe it.

Can you tell us his name?

Radu Vladislas.

Radu Vladislas is a
figment of folklore.

Tell me trust worthy child,

have you tasted blood?

Yes.

Nicolescu: Don't be ashamed.

I can help you.

Is the symptoms of this
terrible affliction.

You can't help me.

No one can.

I'm already dead.

You are not dead.

You're suffering from
an ancient malady.

There is hope for
you if you will agree

to stay with us a while.

Let me devise at
reatment for you.

(foreign language)

We want to help you but you
must cooperate completely.

I'll use them bonds

if you promise to
behave yourself.

Yes! Please!

You must be completely
honest with us.

You were initiated by
Radu Vladislas, correct?

Yes.

Where is Radu now?

I don't know
but he'll find me!

He won't let me get away!

(shivering instrumental music)

Nicolescu: Don't be afraid.

A vampire must be invited

or it cannot enter
sacred ground.

This clinic was
once a monastery.

Radu cannot enter here.

You are safe from him

as long as you stay
within these walls.

Tell me something, does
Radu have the Bloodstone?

Yes.

Have you tasted a bit?

Yes.

What is this Bloodstone?

It's an ancient relic,
revered among the vampires.

A crystal said to drip with
the blood of the saints.

According to legend,

a vampire who has the Bloodstone

can survive without killing.

It's true, yes?

Yes.

But there's a dark
side to its power.

It's driving Radu mad!

This is crazy.

We're scientists, Anna.

We must keep an open mind.

If the Bloodstone exists,

it would be a precious
object for search.

You are not the first
vampire to seek my help.

I will do my best to
ease your suffering.

If it becomes necessary to
take some blood, believe me,

there is no reason
to be ashamed.

I can provide blood for you.

It's not a problem.

Please.


Do not despair.

In time I can free you
of this terrible desire.

(phone rings)

(phone rings)

(foreign language)

Detective Voda?

(foreign language)

The police wants to
ask me some questions.

Please!
Don't tell them about me!

Don't be afraid,
you're secret is safe with us.

(menacing instrumental music)

(echoing footsteps)

(menacing instrumental music)

(door creaking)

Ash, my child.

Master!

I seek sanctuary.

Oh, dinner.

It's yours to share.

I am Radu Vladislas.

I am Serena.

She is my protegee, master.

Extraordinarily clinching.

Ash: Sit.

Take blood with us.

What brings you to
Bucharest, master?

Vengeance.

Vengeance, master?

Against who?

Fledgling who spurns me.

We will help you, master,

to haze in your safe
return to Transylvania.

Our wealth has multiplied.

It is easy to profit from
the corruption of mortals.

The casino and brothel

keeps us well
supplied with income.

And victims.

I'd grow an old
man in Transylvania.

Perhaps I will stay in Buchare
stand reclaim my old things.

As you desire.

I require a resting place.

The seventh level is
off limits to you.

From this day forth.

The seven level is in ruins.

There is better lodging
in the Western quarter.

The seventh level pleases me.

As you wish.

I can provide a willing
mortal for your pleasure.

I normally ask ten
thousand for night,

but to you it is a courtesy.

You can do anything
you want with them.

Short of the guilt.

(suspense instrumental music)

I will amuse myself
with your protegee.

Detective Voda?

Yeah.

I'm Anna Lazar.

This is my colleague,
Doctor Nicolescu.

Thanks for seeing me, Doctor.

I have just a few questions.

The victims were in Transylvania

searching for a
young American woman,

sister of the woman
killed in the wreck.

Was there anyone else?

Any cars or people nearby?

No, there was no one else.

Why did you leave the
scene of the accident?

I waited quite
some time, detective.

Where were you?

I had, other business.

There was nothing I
could do for the victims.

I have patient
shere waiting for me.

There was a man whose
job was to follow them,

a colleague of mine.

And pursuit an stolen artifact.

Lieutenant Marin of
Bucharest police.

(screams in pain)

(car engine)

My master fears you,
Vladislas.

But I'm not afraid.

Ash is wise to fear me.

He sees to the
stronghold from me

and return mortal to grave war.

I knew you'd fear me too

because I'm a monster.

(mysterious instrumental music)

Serena: Destroy
Ash for me, Vladislas.

He keeps me imprisoned
here, in this din of evil.

It is forbidden to
destroy our kindred.

You could reclaim
your stronghold.

Rule over Bucharest.

You are diabolical, Serena.

Do you desire to taste
the blood of the saints?

Yes, but I'm frightened.

I'll let you drink if
you promise to serve me.

I'm yours, master.

(feverish instrumental music)

Poison, child,
to support an elixir.


What's wrong with her?

Is the down of the urges,

the vampire limbers to a
state of his every death.

Please, kill me.

I can't go on like this.

Give us a chance to
help you, Michelle.

I'm sorry, but I must
draw some blood from you

in this moment of surrender.

(mysterious instrumental music)

I'll put my laboratory to
work on this immediately.

We'll be safe here,
whether it's in dark,

no light will penetrate.

Tonight we'll begin
your treatment.


I apologize
for doubting you, Ion.

Can you really help her?

I can listen the urgency
of her of compassion.

Make it possible for her
to move about in daylight,

but she will always
be a vampire.

Let's rest a few hours.

If this child is the
fledgling of Radu Vladislas,

Radu will come to us.

We must be ready to meet him.

(mysterious instrumental music)

Please, sit.

This will help you to relax.

(foreign language)

Cheers.

What's happened to you, Nicu?

You've gained there
putation of a charlatan.

My anti-aging treatment
sare quite effective, Anna.

Even if they are dismissed
by my former colleagues.

Patients come to me
from around the world.

How much do rock stars pay you

to fit all the heroine
from their blood?

More than your friends at
the Academy could in lifetime.

It's sad to see you
wasting your talents, Ion.

Have a drink, Anna.

(foreign language)

This will help you to relax.

Cheers.

Anna, you are more beautiful
now than you were then.

Don't try to flirt with me
with superficial cliches, Ion.

I'm a grown woman now.

I regret sometimes how
our love story ended.

It was not a love story, Ion.

And it ended as it began,

with you seducing
on your student.

I beg your pardon.

It was you who seduced me.

It was a silly misadventure.

I'm so tired.

Wake me in a few hours.

(tense instrumental music)

Forgive me, Anna.

But I find you...

irresistible.

(menacing instrumental music)

Any word from
Lieutenant Marin?

No, sir.

We checked his apartment.

He hasn't been there for days.

(foreign language)

Lieutenant Marin.

Lieutenant Marin!

Have you been
drinking, Lieutenant?

I, I don't know.

I'm sick.

I don't know what's happened.

You were supposed to
spy on the Americans.

Now everyone is dead, and
you're drunk in the tub!

Mel Thompson from
Embassy is dead?

I had to go out to Stirbei
in the middle of the night

to question a witness.

It's your case!

It is you who
should do the work!

One more mistake Lieutenant
and you are fired!

(tense instrumental music)

(foreign language)

If she drank
from the Bloodstone,

we should find someone
with unusual sequences

in the DNA.

Find the Bloodstone's DNA,

and we may find the
secret to eternal youth.

Ion, are we trying
to cure this girl?

Or use her for our search?

We have sent a simple
masquerade in us doctors.

The most important thing

is to gain position
of the Bloodstone.

Anna, Anna.

Wake up.

What time is it?

There is something
I want to show you.

Our patient will be waking soon.

What's this?

Some lamps
from our taming zone,

tweaking him.

Holy water bottled by
the monks of Lake Borgo,

who by the way make an
excellent complement.

Stakes

to pierce his heart.

If Radu Vladislas comes
to claim his protegee,

we must be ready to
defend ourselves.

You said he cannot enter here.

Yes, but the girl
was invited in by me.

Is as great a threat
to us as Radu.

This is barbaric.

I won't let you drive
a stake into her heart.

If it comes necessary
you won't try to stop me.

(suspense instrumental music)

Take me into
the grave night, master.

Teach me the mysteries.

Ash does not appreciate
the pleasure of the hunt.

Return to you master,
you're not my fledgling.

(suspense instrumental music)

We must destroy him, master.

He is evil incarnate.

Do not meddle in
his affairs, Serena.

He is insane.

He possesses
the Bloodstone.

The Bloodstone?

Are you sure?

We can destroy him and
claim it for ourselves.

Radu is my master, Serena.

But he's not mine.

It will give me pleasure
to watch him suffer.

You are no match for him.

We must find a mortal with
the will to destroy him.

(door creaking)

(menacing instrumental music)

Here is the key to
the grave night.

Follow him.

Discover his intentions.

Yes, master.

(door creaking)

(crickets chirping)

(suspense instrumental music)

(door knocking)

Marin: Hey! Help!

Help me!

Somebody hears me?

Hey!

Hey!

Somebody hear me!

Hey!

Ah!

Come to me, pretty one.

Your time has come
to serve your master.

Now, tell me,
where's my fledgling?

I don't know!

I swear to you!

But at Stirbeit
here is a witness!

Yes!

Stirbei?
Yes!

(tense instrumental music)

The first stage
of treatment

is to draw all the
blood from your body.

Purify and filter it,
and replace it one again.

I predict we should see
some immediate improvement.

It's necessary for us to work

while you are fully conscious.

And so they backed

through there maybe some discomfort.

(screaming in pain)

(suspense instrumental music)

You are Radu's pretty one.

No, no!

No!

No!

(suspense instrumental music)

All signs are stable.

Excellent.

Tell me.

She has survived
the first tribulation.

How do you feel, Michelle?

I feel peaceful.

This is a good sign.

But don't be surprised if
the benefit is temporary.

I am Radu Vladislas.

This is a private route.

What is your business here?

I demand an audience with
the master of this house.

Doctor, there is
a man outside

insistent to speak with you.

His name is Radu Vladislas.

He's come for me!

Niculescu: Please!

Try to remain calm.

There is no way
he can enter here.

Lupu, the sedative.

(anxious instrumental music)

I am obligated to
speak with him.

(trembling instrumental music)

Radu Vladislas.

I'm Doctor Ion Niculescu.

You hold my child
against her will?

She's in pain and cries
for my protection.

Let me cross your threshold.

No, Vladislas.

You are not welcome here.

Release here to me and
I should leave in peace.

Deny me and I will lay
your souls to waste.

She begged for sanctuary.

She wish she is to
be mortal again.

She wishes for the impossible.

She belongs to me.

No!

She's in my care now.

Leave her alone or
I'll call the police!

Challenge me at
your own peril.

Like the lighting.

Such diversions.

I'll be siege you.

Open your gate to me!

Do you possess the Bloodstone?

The Bloodstone
is my birth right.

Who came before you?

Ash, the music lover.

I am before Ash.

Please, Vladislas.

Let me see it.

Give me a few drops
of its essence

in the name of science.

I have lived a thousand years.

Witnessed the progress of man.

I have a weak spot in my
heart for the sciences.

Open your gate and I will
give you three drops.

But I warn you, Doctor,

the mysteries of the Bloodstone

cannot be illuminated
by science.

(suspense instrumental music)

Anna: No!

No, Ion!

Are you crazy?

You promised to protect us!

No! Please, no!

Don't do this! Ion!

No, Ion! Please!

Don't let him! No, Ion!

(vibrant instrumental music)

Master!

(vibrant instrumental music)

You are powerless before me!

Get down on your knees!

Give me the Bloodstone!

The Bloodstone now!

You won't return
a daylight for this!

(overcome instrumental music)

Set me free!

My master needs me!

The sedative! Quickly!

(tense instrumental music)


Stay away from me!

(anxious instrumental music)

I'm sorry
to give you such a shock,

but it was necessary to
dissect him for the trap.

Will he die like this?

The stake is the first step.

The vampire cannot move.

Next we have two choices:

cut off his head,

which should be too
merciful for Radu.

Or leave it to agonize

until the Sun comes up
and renders it to dust.

Michelle: Master!

No!

Michelle, go back inside!

I beg you to destroy me.

No, Michelle!

You are free of him.

Vadislas is dying.

No!

(overcome instrumental music)

Radu: Michelle.

My blood runs within you.

What's beat us one.

Stand away!

Do not touch him!

Michelle, get away from him!

Save me and I'll allow
to set you free.

(tense instrumental music)

Now, prove yourself fledgling.

Let there be a bloodbath.

I saved you life, Radu.

I've earned my freedom.

You will pay forthis in suffering.

(menacing instrumental music)

(foreign language)

You wish to destroy
Radu Vladislas.

Who are you?

A kindred spirit.

Done to ravage.

I will tell you where
he sleeps if you promise

to destroy him before
this day is done.

Where does he sleep?

Tell us.

Not you.

You must destroy him.

Me? Why?

Because you wish the save
the life of Radu's fledgling.

They sleep in Belus Cemetary,
but two of Vladislas.

From the year of 1875.

Here is the key.

The sarcophagus
takes you underground

to the ancient city.

Go south, down seven staircases.

There you will find
Radu's resting place.

You are one pretty one.

You have the passion to prevail.

Surprise him while he sleeps.

Drive a stake through his heart.

Cut off his head.

Take it back the way you came.

Do not hesitate

or explore the elaborately.

Go quickly to the sunlight

and render Radu's head to dust.

(mysterious instrumental music)

(foreign language)

(tense instrumental music)

Buy yourself a new one.

(bell rings)

(bell rings)

(religious piano music)

(foreign language)

(menacing instrumental music)

(foreign language)

(frightening instrumental music)

Michelle?

I can save you from this torment

if you come to me of
your own free will.

Never.

Will we share my sanctuary?

The sacred mysteries?

Drink of the Bloodstone.

I'm your master,
you cannot deny me!

Stefan was my master.

Stefan infected you
with his tragic weakness.

His love for mortals.

But Stefan was much more,

and he's dust!

So you are mine!

(trembling instrumental music)

(suspense instrumental music)

Your powers have reborn.

But your weakness
threatens to destroy you.

Michelle,

I know your despair.

Surrender your ties to mortality

and all your pain
will disappear.

(tense instrumental music)

Tomorrow, master,

when the Sun is high,
Vladislas will be dust.

You are a never ending
source of joy to me, Serena.

How will the deed be done?

I found a mortal with
the will to destroy him.

You conspired with a mortal?

I gave her the key
to Vladislas tomb.

You endangered us, Serena.

Fear not, master.

I sabotaged the mechanism.

The key works from the outside

but it's broken from within.

She will destroy
Vladislas for us

and be trapped in the labyrinth.

And when the Sunsets
we can ravish her

and seize the Bloodstone.

I am diabolical.

Aren't I , master?

Serena, you are sublime.

There is ones
mall complication, master.

Complication?

She's in league
with Doctor Blood.

Today?

No, of the Bloodstone?

Yes, Doctor Blood tried to

steal it from Radu.

But tell me master,

if the Doctor is descended
from our bloodline,

how is it he can
stand in the light

and touch holy water
with his bare hands?

He spawned from
our blood, Serena.

But he's altered
himself with science.

Ash, my child.

Master.

Henceforth I claim
all the profits

from your well-being
and surprises.

But master!

I've netted to the holdings
for a hundred years.

I have earned your generosity.

I generously give
you until full moon

to evacuate my stronghold.

You and your fledglings
must find a new sanctuary.

(tense instrumental music)

The blade of Laertes.

The vampire slayer is mine.

(tense instrumental music)

Radu: You stole it from me, Ash.

And then black played.

You cannot force me, Radu.

You are not my master.

You amuse me,

Serena.

You know my stay.

(anxious instrumental music)

Your ravage is
yielding, fledgling.

I can see the
darkening in your eyes.

You're memories of mortality
will fade like a sweet dream.

Your mind forever more.

(anxious instrumental music)

Niculescu: We should
rest until daylight.

You have a difficult task ahead.

Thank you
for helping me, Ion.

You don't have to thank me.


(glass breaking)

(frenetic instrumental music)

(moves to slowed suspense
instrumental music)

(echoing footsteps)

(moves to trembling
instrumental music)

Anna!

Help! Help! Someone!

Help me! Help me, please!

Stop it, Anna!
Help me!

Anna, stop it!

Anna!

Please, listen.
No!

You're a vampire.

I'm not a vampire,
I'm human too.

You must listen to Ion.

Please, listen to me.

I didn't choose to be a vampire.

It was forced upon me.

You're a murderer!

No, I drink only
to sustain my life.

The woman you saw is
a willing partner.

Please, believe me!

I curses this fate!

Each day I pray to God
to make me mortal again.

To be feel the warmth of
the sand upon my face.

To let me survive one night
without the urge for blood.

Radu must be destroyed, Anna.

By a mortal saint.

Why me?

Why not Lupu?

He's a mortal too.

I'm a mere surgeon,
not a vampire hunter.

Trust me, Anna.

I promise to help you.

(hopeful instrumental music)

Where is the body bag?

I have it here.

If we are lucky, I can
find Radu's resting place.

It may be necessary
to kill her too

if she is too deep in
Radu's control to be saved.

No.

With the Bloodstone
she has a chance.

We must find a way
for both of you

to sharing its benefits.

Thank you, Anna.

Bullets are powerless
against a vampire.

Even so, the mere
sense of security

is better than no
security at all.

(suspense instrumental music)

Niculescu: Dammit!

We don't have time for this.

(foreign language)

Show me respect for the dead.

I'm one of the dead people,

so don't tell me what to do.

It's afternoon already.

Isn't there another way in?

This is the only way.

(suspense instrumental music)

Look for a tomb inscribed
Vladislas, 1875.

Anna, go that way.

I'll search back here.

Lupu, behind the church.

We rendezvous here
in one hour, yes?

Anna: Okay.

(suspense instrumental music)

Ion!

Ion!

Ion, I found it!

Good.

Let's go to work.

(uneasy instrumental music)

You keep the key.

Open the door
when you hear us calling.

Don't worry.

I'll be waiting.

If we are not
out at nightfall,

send for the police.

(suspense instrumental music)

One hour and 30
minutes until sunset.

You are frightened, yes?

Yes.

(suspense instrumental music)

What is this place?

The ancient city
beneath the city.

(suspense instrumental music)

Anna: We must
be 300 feet down.

Niculescu: I think
we are almost there.

(suspense instrumental music)

Ah!

You'll make a pretty plaything.

Ah!

(Radu screaming)

(trembling instrumental music)

Michelle!

(trembling instrumental music)

She's yours, Vladislas.

I brought her for you as
a gesture of good will.

Ah!

No!

That's right! Struggle!

Fear me, child!

Fear is such a really
neat to do to the blood.

Oh, Doctor.

You want a tasteof the Bloodstone?

(increasingly suspense
instrumental music)

Ah!

(owl hooting)

(foreign language)

(crickets chirping)

Anna: Lupu!

Help me, Lupu!

(tense instrumental music)

Why are you here?

Alone at night?

I'm praying for the departed.

For a lost one.

Don't lie to me, mortal.

The key in your
hand belongs to me.

No!

Ah!

(anxious instrumental music)

Anna: Lupu! Doctor Lupu!

Doctor Lupu, Doctor Lupu!

Please, help! Please,
open the door!

Ah!

Can't you just save me?

(frightening instrumental music)

What do you want from me?

Your life blood.

This thing which
allows us to impulse

of my fledglings' humanity.

Anna: No!

Michelle!

(suspense instrumental music)

Surrender child!

And I'll have mercy,
chance be in your life

will be an ever
lasting torment.

Michelle, help me please!

Reach out with
senses, fledgling.

Reveling the perfume of fear.

No, please!

Radu: Drink, fledgling.

Pour your sadness in
a whispering of blood.

Michelle, please!

Drink, fledgling!

Or I'll ravage her myself

and multiply your
nightmares a thousand forth.

Michelle.

No!

This is a moment of weakness
you will never forget.

Anna: No! No!

No! No!

(trembling instrumental music)

(mumbling, gagging)

(screaming in pain)

(vibrant instrumental music)

You can't destroy me.

(iron hitting)

(tense instrumental music)

It will be dawn soon.

Take his head out
into the sunlight.

You are coming
with me, Michelle.

He's got the Bloodstone.

You're going to be alright now.

(flames burning)

I curse you, Vladislas.

(tense instrumental music)

Come on, Michelle.

We have to hurry!

I can't.

The sun is rising.

You have to keep
moving, Michelle.

We have to get you out of here.

(tense instrumental music)

Michelle: No, please don't.

I can't go on.

No!

We are almost there.

(tense instrumental music)

Doctor Lupu! Doctor Lupu
open the door, please!

Your friend,the doctor, is dead.

(tense instrumental music)

Where is the Bloodstone?

Help! Someone help me!

She's a pretty one, master.

The fear is a rare perfume.

Ah! Ah!

Help! Someone help me!

Help!

Ah!

(vibrant instrumental music)

(Gravekeeper and Anna
screaming at the same type)

Don't move, Michelle!

(foreign language)

(resolution instrumental music)

Michelle: At last, I was in peace.

In time, the Bloodstone yielded
its mysteries to me.

Radu Valdislas was returned to dust.

(mysterious instrumental music)
