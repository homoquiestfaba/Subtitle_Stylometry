A
Balance, Will.
Feet shoulder width apart.

If you beweegd, you slide.
You make no steps.

Sword up.
Elbows inside.

This is the center position.

Now you fall on me.

Remember, Will, knights honor.

Others not usually.
I almost did.

Almost another word for death,
boy.

I'll check the traps.
Bring the sheep to the south pasture.

Soapwort is growing on the ridge.
Maybe Crow an antidote.

We need a good warp
the winter, to endure.

Drink this for pain.
Thank you, Crow.

We can forget that wool.
Soapwort is growing everywhere.

Hey, Crow.
Good evening.

You have probably no cure for soapwort?

If I had, I was rich.

Maybe the secret is in you, Will.

What hebje that magic of yours
if you can not even?

We'll see how bad it is.

It will hardly be enough for socks.
Then we slaughter.

Another thing:
There are four sheep along the river.

Completely torn.

That was fixed back dog.

You must leave this mountain, Will.
What?

You have no future here.

You have a gift
and that you squandered as a farmer.

There's a man on behalf of Sterling.
Give it to him.

A low lander?
Give him this.

He will record as a vassal.

He's a baron.

By the plague, he has lost
from all others.

But he is smart and will favor
the new king to win.

As you can benefit.

That's your future,
that you understand.

Here I build my own future,
just like you and Crow.

I am your father.
You're still a child ...

Will!
Let him go, Tom.

He's a proud guy. Like you.

You've waited a long time.

Some things you should
leave to your descendants.

Will, go to the north pasture
and check the traps.

Hebje hear me?

Father!

We lack even half dozen.

That was not a wolf.
It's bigger.

Maybe a bear.

A dragon.

We have here
20 years no dragon seen.

What a disaster.
The province will perish.

There is no animal on.

The dragon must have a nest.
Yes. Within a radius of 100 miles.

She does not kill to eat.
So?

She defends her territory.
The nest can not be far.

A dragon
is worth 1000 gold pieces.

How do you know it's a vroumje?
Here we come back.

We must
The rest of the herd care.

We urge her to
and observing the nest.

We steal the egg
while sheep kills.

1000 gold pieces
are enough for a lifetime.

You seem really opje mother.

God help me.

I would be
If I could fly.

You should look here!

Her litter
this should be close.

Without wings
You do not get.

Because you get old!

Yes, and I'm still alive,
because I never rock climb.

I do not want to die ignorant.

No!

The situation is worse than he admitted.

You'll have to sell.
Never.

I will find the dragon.

I'm off again tomorrow,
find the nest and kill the dragon.

Are you crazy? No man
can kill a dragon.

Superstition.
It's only an animal?

Pack your bags tomorrow.

And are you employed by Sterling.
No.

Your time here is over.

Be a loyal vassal
and lets you dub.

That was the wish of your father.

The talisman of a knight.
Passed in my order.

I am the last of our
and will not live to see fights.

Imbued with the prayers
thousands of gods.

He protects
to him who wears it.

You do not believe
In that sort of thing.

But remember:
We are a mountain people.

We carry a force within us.

Thank you, Crow.

Excuse me.

I said excuse me.

What is it?
Are your sheep run away?

Yes, they were overwrought.

I want to go to the castle
baron of Sterling.

About four miles further
on the left.

Spaarje the trouble, man.
He claims no one.

And certainly not someone like you.

Thank you.
But further toil, kitchen boys.

Go back to thee hills, shepherd.

My dog ??has your mother
jumped four times.

And you said the dog was better.

Look.

What are you doing?

J Excuse but there is need for precision.

To see your hands,
you are a sorceress.

I am not,
brutal flail.

Hopefully you expect no reward.
Rather go on.

As a reward
can a traveler the way.

Where are you going?
Sterling Manor.

Then Gaje in the wrong direction.
What?

You had two miles ago
west to go.

What? The liars ...

Thanks voorje help, boy.
I'm not uwjongen.

Are you lost, mountaineer?

Where is Sterling?
Why do you want him?

That's just something about Sterling.

He is in his chambers. There are
no servants to show you the way.

Not living in any case.
There has been too poor for the baron.

But beware, the last mountain dwellers
who came here

He has driven away with a whip.

The Baron does not like heikneuters.

I do not want your toils
as a farmer.

Who else should do the job,
father?

Our people are dead or fled.
We have almost nothing.

Sam and the others
working in the fields.

I let my country is not negligible.

The nuns would make you a lady.

A lady?
That was a waste of money.

Who now married with a devil?

Do you want the property would cause
when I'm gone?

The king wants to fill his coffers.

They will kill you and no heir
this land of the king.

No man need me to tell
what to do.

Lord Sterling?
How did you get here?

That's the man
of whom I have told you.

We have no need. Get out!

Ask Sam in the stables
something to eat.

Tonight you can sleep there,
but tomorrow you should go.

I Will Shepherd.
I want to serve as a vassal.

I do not need vassals.
Go away.

I must give you this.

Kate, let us alone.

But let me
do some embroidery, right dad?

Shepherd, did you?

Do you know what this letter says?
No, sir.

You come from the mountains.
Are you a magician?

No.
I tolerate no magic.

Got it?
Yes, sir.

Can you ride?
Yes.

A helpful guy, huh?
I'm trying.

At least when it comes to walls.

You can continue temporarily.

Sam will work to give you tomorrow.

Thank you, sir.

Check it out. One, two ...

Still lost, boy?

The pig was there.
It looks like it.

Sterling tells me that you
a mattress and work can give.

What a pity now.

Those two hate heikneuters.

You can sleep better somewhere else.

I do take it.

Are you deaf?
Do sit down, Sam.

Save that for tomorrow only.

Keep it up!
Fine rooting in the mud, boy!

What are you doing here?

I was!

Give it here.
Do not look. Turn around.

You looked at me.
To indicate that shirt.

No, I mean that.
No.

Although ... yes. No.

I did not
you took a bath here.

Oh, the darling of my father's shirt.

Stay're not just standing.

So you want to
a vassal of my father?

Yes.
And where is your family?

Death.

My mother died when I was little
and my father recently.

I'm sorry. How did he die?

By a dragon.

I thought
that no longer existed.

You thought I was a sorceress.
I saw your ring.

I have magical symbol
seen before.

Sorcery is your specialty.
Not mine.

What was in that letter?

That was not for me.
Of course.

Father has farmers need
no vassals.

He will only plow
and learn to obey.

Why is the fire in the house?
We have guests?

I'm not here to be a farmer.
Take the basket with you?

How far are you driving?
A few hundred miles.

Good trip?
Yes. Very good.

You have a new horse?
Yes. A particularly noble breed.

Rogan, it's good to see you.

The pleasure is mutual.

Heaven, you are truly blossomed.

Your daughter has grown
to a beautiful peach

needed to be picked.

I will only take
chaste as a compliment.

You're too good.
I think so.

You arrive just in time.

My cousin,
widow Lady Spriggs, arrives today.

You know that old rod anyway?
Father!

Why does it express
the truth

always turn to violent protest?

Eleanor will be happy to see you.

Perhaps this leads
her attention from me.

What is the situation in Sterling Manor?

Good. We expand the fields out.
The weed spreads.

Guests are not blind you, Robert.
Your estate is a rurne.

We'll be fine.

Owen viceroy soon we will certainly
back to the crown in favor of the stand.

Tell us, Sir Rogan, you are still
the favorite at every tournament?

I have not
found equal opponent.

The ladies should cover your feet.

Which game form
the court is currently popular?

The King
would prefer two opponents

with a rope attached.

The first to fall loses.

I'm still unconquered.

Great. Pity
game that your days are over.

I'd like you
seen in the game.

A man like the Baron has established
a more interesting pastime.

What brings you here, Rogan?

An invitation.

I want you to come along with me
counsel to the knight.

In the highlands
A yard burned.

The family was found
scattered in the area.

It seems
a dragon that destroyed our country.

Horrible.
Nonsense. Wolves that are fixed.

I have to stir the fire.

These mountain people lie to the people
the money from their pocket to store.

Your prejudice is misplaced.

It is about 14 days ago

I woke up from
a terrible roar.

I went to the window,
but there was nothing to see.

Exactly.
Because it was imagination.

And now you think
these stupid rumors

proof
voorje figments.

And yet I continue to Kate,
as long as you're on the board.

Will has seen him.

As seen baby?
The dragon.

Nonsense.
I believe he speaks the truth.

Tell him, Will.

Well?
It's true, sir.

I knew it.

The Board will decide
what we do with that beast.

Most will want to wait.

Cowards. He's probably not that big
as the myths say.

He is at least 40 feet long and
twice as wide as the wings.

If you are going to consider
a solution, take that boy with you.

He saw it.

How far were you from?
Very close.

No one comes close to a dragon
without dying.

Unless you are able
to kill the dragon.

Beweerje that?
No, sir.

But it is my intention.

Dragons are in the myth
slain by knights.

Loopjij also by fire, boy?

No, sir.

You will be beaten down to Knight
if you kill the beast.

Moreover, the whole kingdom
you celebrate.

A true Paladin.

But we now have an opponent
for you, Rogan.

Excuse me?
For a demonstration game.

He is only a servant, Milady,
and not practiced.

But he is strong. I predict
a surprising victory.

Madame, you insult me.

I bet the boy.

You're a crafty lady.

I'm going to bet.

Keep it simple and try
not hurt.

I assume that the fighting
the court a little longer.

Satisfied?
It was his first attempt.

Double or nothing.

More beatings, boy?

That's what we do not
if it is a cousin.

Note opje words
to your superiors.

No, forget it.
I do like temperament.

I know what I neersla.

Thank you,
You had a very lucrative opponent.

Do not be ungrateful.
Show your appreciation.

My lord. I'm sorry
I've disappointed you.

It was very entertaining.
We go inside, Rogan. Come.

Your new servant is entertaining.

His idea to kill the dragon
is certainly enticing.

With weapons and cunning to
brave men kill a dragon.

That sounds very modern.
I do feel the same way, Sterling.

I can make good use
ally with the board.

Your daughter is really
a charming young lady.

I am looking
a wife, Sterling.

What do you think?
That is very generous, Baron.

But I am poor.
She has no dowry.

If I wanted gold, I the daughter
a money changer married.

Give me uwwestelijke lands.
These lie fallow anyway.

The rest I yard after your death.

A good match for your daughter

and I guarantee that the crown
You will be well disposed.

A tempting offer, Rogan.

But my country in the south
has been intended for someone else.

Who?

The servant. Will Shepherd.

But he knows it yet.
A bastard?

No. Nothing of the sort.

A very old agreement.

If he does not know
and furthermore no one ...

Tell him.
I will certainly not do so.

That was a bad move, Sterling.
This is not your nature.

I did not know that punches
with a rope game allowed.

I've changed, not him.

Are we agreed?

You can give me what you want.

It will not be easy
to convince her.

You are too lenient.

A daughter, the good advice
her father to speak.

Lady, I must say Spriggs
that Rogan might be an idiot,

but that its currency
still has value.

I dried meat voorje
brought. And this.

The livery of my father.

I could not find the same
between the old stuff,

but here it is.

Gold stands for ambition
and brown for patience.

The latter I have enough,
I'm afraid.

But these are
the colors of my father.

I thought as his vassal to them
perhaps in the Council.

Only look at.

So. Very stately.

I ...
I just wanted ...

I still have a lot to prepare.

Hey, guys!

Here comes the champion.

You have him poepie
to smell, eh?

Hey. What is that?

We need to bed early.
The baron has need us tomorrow.

Maarjij does not count.

The Baron wants you to stay here.

You must clean up manure.
What a pity now.

Maybe you had a few of us
You can learn sword tricks.

Remember
the pigs.

And to do laundry.
Where is he?

What?
My dagger.

I do not know what you mean.

Beweerje sometimes
I'm a thief?

You're worse than a thief.

Just ask your little lady.

She needs a man,
not a boy like you.

I'm just eager
my hands wet

when it comes to
that is kind of washes.

So, guys.

It is time we
to shepherd a lesson.

Come here. Come on.

Not in the face,
Never in the face.

The baron wants
that we're friends.

Come on.

You're still here.

Yes, so to see.

This is voorjou.

Now you're here, you can use the dovecote
Please clean?

I want to love birds again.

No.

Oh, I get it.

Of course.

My father has
just lifted his heels

and now a woman in control
has done nothing.

But I will
the estate keep it going,

even if I do everything
to sacrifice for.

I said "No, no beer."
But now you say:

over the bird droppings on yourself,
I'm leaving.

What's going on?

Your father
my father had made a promise.

He would teach me,
so that I could make something of my life.

But I am nothing
manure larger than one.

And the only thing I've learned is
that your promises are worth nothing.

Come on.

This sword is more than
400 years in my family.

We have blocked
for looters.

One night was one of
our employees and wanted to steal it.

Father hit him so hard,
I thought it would break his skull.

I never
allowed to touch.

Great.

Father would take us both
murder when he saw us.

Actually, I wanted to show you this.

I have often secretly
In watching.

Pictures of brave men
and beautiful women.

And the words in this book tell

how to become a knight.

Begrijpje?

We can study
while my father is gone.

If you behave like a knight,
vaderje will respect.

He will fulfill his duty
and you dub.

We?

Can you read and understand this language?
No.

I have.
So I say "we".

Come tonight
to the clearing in the woods.

I want to show you something.

I wanted to show you this.

Only in this place, they wounded costs.
Only thus can they kill.

A sword through the flames
In the mouth of the dragon punches.

Simple.

Listen.

In the monastery exchanged a traveler
this at a meal.

Nobody wanted it,
why I got it.

What is it?
Words.

About the power within us and
the things around us.

You mean magic.

Gifts, Will.
As the gifts of the paladins.

Paladins.
That do not exist.

See that?
They are symbols.

Such symbols
Also in the pages of this book.

The knights were real.

They were mystic knights
who worshiped their gods.

If their hearts pure, they were
blessed with incredible strength.

I thought you were not a witch.

You're not listening, Will.

Each of us must find his gift.

Some may see the future.

Understand others
people in their hearts.

Others may tame animals.

Almost no one has all the gifts.
But everyone has one.

Paladins were Knights
with the gift to believe

them unharmed
could go through the fire.

Why should you look for
for something that is not there?

Wait.

Loosen up.

Now put your hand out.

In the beginning it
a dot in the dark.

It grows in your heart and knocks.

I feel it.

Let yourself be swept away by it.

Until you find your heart
jump out of your chest.

Now you can slowly let go,
as a breath

or ... like an explosion.

And that was just a little magic trick.

Good night.

Will? What is it?
Stay inside!

What's that sound?
Will, what's going on?

Will!

What are you doing, Will?

What was that?

Will ... No. Do not go!

Will, please! Listen to me.

Come on!

I'm here! Come on!

What happened?

Kate, what happened?

You were almost roasted
chip as a pig.

Blockhead.
The dragon has slain my father.

You will still want
that he had slain you too.

Boy, you have a brave heart.

I hope you're wise enough
You protect against.

What has she? Is she hurt?

They ran burns
when she saved your life.

My cousin
appears to be a sorceress.

She led the strongest flames
away from you,

but they themselves could
do not swerve.

It's a special girl.
Say nothing against Sterling please.

Will, what is my cattle there?

In full bloom, I hope.

You're back.
Indeed.

Politics is a waste of time.

Nothing but meaningless chatter and fuss.

But I do have the dice
a beautiful stallion won.

He is five miles to the south.
Do me a favor and get him.

Yes, sir.

Kate! Kate!

Shelton
they open a market.

It is time to put the family
to reinstate. Come.

Father, I must tell you something.

Father, I wish ...

I taught him.

Father, I'm sorry.

He had no choice ...
How did he know this?

The dragon was here and Will ...
You have told him.

Yes.

He is very brave father.

Half of your sword
is still in the body of the beast.

You're a slut.

Just like your mother.

Eight generations of my ancestors
have this sword honored.

That boy must go.

And as for you ...

I'm tired of you cheating
and your disobedience.

You are now
the problem of another.

What?
Rogan wants your wife.

He wants to tame.
Let him try it.

No.

Robert!

All these years I thought

that the plague was
Maurelle who had slain.

Maarjij have slain her.

Opje own way.
By jealousy and rage.

Wake up, son.

Crow What are you doing here?
I've seen something in the fire.

Sterling's daughter has run away.

Where is she?
I do not know.

I head towards Corange.

We meet
at sunset in Mealdon.

Wake up. Wake up.
Kate is gone.

Kate!

Kate!

Kate!

Kate!

Kate!

Kate!

Will! Will, I'm here!

He'll find anywhere.

He will not find me.

Then I have to find him.
What?

He will be sick with worry.

He's your father. And my master.

That we owe him.

Hebje not hear what I said?

Father hates you.
He gives me in marriage to Rogan

after you have pierced
with the rest of his sword.

The pigs will miss me.
Forget the pork!

He will surely find.

And one day he will find you.

And what do you think will happen?

That's not important.

As long as we are together.

I want voorje worry, Kate.

But I would not know how.

I have no country, no future.

I love you, Kate.

I desire to thee.
My passion can burn us both.

But I do not want this way.
I will not flee.

I need you home.

Oh, baby.
Thank God, you live.

I came immediately.
Come in quickly.

Take care of the horse, servant.

Two people carry is heavy.

You have brought my daughter home.
I'm in your duty.

I'm gonna wash
Kate and greet.

Then come to the castle.
We need to talk.

It is time we
training to start your vassal.

High time, sir.

You've proven you are a good boy
like, just as brutal.

This ...

This document
you have given me

is a land donation.

I gave your father,
but he did not use it.

Now this country of yours.

Or at the time
waaropjij want to claim it.

So now you knight and landowner.

Your future
looks really bright, boy.

I take what I may.

Kate has told you
Rogan that she will marry?

She does not like him.
You think you know what she feels?

Rogan is a powerful man, he can
her a secure future.

Hair and therefore you.
And do not forget.

She does not like him.
I ask for her hand.

You think you're man enough
for her?

How long do you think that your country
can hold without my favor?

Every baron in the country
is stingy in my blood.

The wolves surround me al
I bring her to my house.

It is difficult, but
she knows from work and I love her.

Love?
How long will it last love,

if the pig
under her fingernails to scrape away?

Would you like her a privileged life
decrease in wealth?

That is not love.
You are too far below its position.

As mother was under your state.

Kate, go to thee room.
You have driven her, right?

Who said that? Spriggs?
Jump to thee room!

You you could
never hold tantrums.

So it all started.

Your mother was engaged
Wills with father. Did you know?

Shut up, old witch.
A special woman.

Not the brightest
Sterling who had ever seen,

but she had a spell
that went deeper than beauty.

Sterling was overwhelmed.
He ignored her engagement.

He dazzled her by his wealth.

Finally she agreed.

Tom's heart was broken.
Stop it.

As a wedding gift bestowed
Sterling your mother a piece of land.

Plagued by guilt
she put the country on Tom's name.

Sterling was suspicious.

His jealousy and anger
drove him to madness.

The more he checked her,
the more they withdrew.

Maurelle finally fled.

She found Tom
and begged him for forgiveness.

But in the meantime had
Tom a wife.

There was a baby on the way: Will.

With a broken heart
she returned to her parents.

There she found
she was pregnant.

The man
for whom she had fled.

One day he found her ...
but it was too late.

The plague had got it.

Sterling was mad with grief.

But a magician from the mountains
brought you to him.

His newborn daughter.

Sterling cured of his madness
and brought you home.

I do not want.

You're just a simple soul
as your father.

But, Will, I thought ... Will!

It was time for the truth, Robert.

Will!

Listen to me, please.

Let us go away from here.

We begin a new life
in the mountains.

I know
where it will run out, Kate.

What do you mean?
Your father is right.

No.

It's a hard life.
I would rob you of a better life.

No, no, no.
I do not want to hear.

I'm zonderje away, Kate.

Let me go.

Let go!

Coward!

This land is refused by Will
and now Kate,

because the purpose of her mother.

Wedding Kate, it's yours

Her country, my country. Everything.

In return, I
an invitation to the court.

For this you need a present.
We spend a fun of it.

Makes it look
if that kid did it.

It's good.

Take too long tail to the fire,
Gaje things.

Will you always aansluipen?

How hebje me?
I've stared into the fire.

I knew
I'd find you here.

A wounded animal
always goes back home.

I can not go home,
I know.

I certainly do not ask
what happened?

The dragon is back.

He has a nest
somewhere on the coast.

I hebje remaining sheep care.

The dragon eats them with relish,
Despite soapwort.

They are your sheep.
I gave them to you.

Why hebje said nothing?

That was one thing
between your father and Sterling.

Not your business
and certainly not mine.

There are new rumors.
Sterling stallion has disappeared.

They say that you've stolen it.

I do not know
where that damn horse.

They look for a reason
to kill me.

I know Sterling.
He would kill you for no reason.

Tell me what to say.

Go to him
go and confront.

I see no reason.
Every person has his limits.

I thought the reason had green eyes
and no wall was built.

At least not without help.

You're a smart girl. With time
you will understand my decision.

Say goodbye to your father,
as it should.

The men are restless.

And I hate waiting.
Customize opje words, Rogan.

Yet she is not yours
Oh no?

I doubt that we have a chance.

Those stories of sorcery
and witch art nonsense.

Dragons are not magical creatures.

You can kill them
like any other animal.

We do it
like others before us.

We catch him, tie him up
and pull his tongue out.

Are the horses ready?
Yes, my lord.

The hunt is open.

Good luck and
foretaste of future joys.

You go too far, sir.

Still not far enough.

I want to speak Sterling.

He will not come back soon.

Kate walked towards forest.

I want to Sterling.
Too bad.

You come because of this stallion?

They found him next to the servant Sam.
Or what was left of him.

So you can feel free to go.

What happened to him?
It was the dragon.

Sterling opjacht gone.

He plans
to kill the beast

and wealth and honor to achieve.

A risky enterprise,

but I
that the price is worth the risk.

I have a sword.

And a horse, I think.

It was my grandfather,
maarjij have the same build.

Kneel before me, boy.
What?

The privilege of my title.

I'm entitled to my own knights
to choose. Kneel down.

Strive courageously for justice.

May God
give you wisdom and faith.

Verhefje as a knight.

I am very attached to this sword.

Be a good boy
and get the missing piece.

The rah!

Kate!

It smells like he's around.

Kate, you're finally there.
Will Is Here?

He was here.
But he's gone opjacht.

Where Gaje go?
A horse saddle.

Be wise, Kate. Death
meet is not a solution.

Although Rogan probably also
a body to wife.

Crow! Crow!

What is it, boy?
I sheep who need it.

If you pay for them.
And that jar too.

Wait, pour it somewhere else.

No time.

I hope for a good cause.
That's it.

Tie the horses.
We continue on foot.

This is a good place.
Prepare for the bait.

What does he want here?

This is a bad place.
No cover.

He'll need to narrow down,
otherwise you will be roasted.

Do not tell me what to do.
We have a clear view.

This place is perfect.

You make a mistake.
I've seen the beast.

It hebje
lost a precious sword.

And you had your
be rescued by a woman.

Go back to the stable
if you are scared.

You'll die meaningless.

Wait.

This I found in a pile of ashes.

It's yours.

Success.
You, too.

Kate! Kate, go back!

Go back!

Father.
It's okay.

Let me get out of here.

Where's Will?
The coward fled.

Here he comes.

Father ... Father.

Witchcraft.

You did this cause.

What?

Your father said
that I had to tame.

I will not tame.
No one!

You spurn me
and choose a country boy?

That we will see.

Bring it on!

Come on!

What are you doing?
You'll see.

We can
kill the dragon together.

I'm not on that dragon.
I actually have more problems with you.

I thought it was adoration.
But she wants to go your way.

I can not allow.

It would mean much
that they are above farmer you prefer.

I admit,
You have a lot of guts.

My dogs
will feast tonight.

This is much more personal
than with a sword.

Careful, man.

My god, that stuff stinks.

Lubrication is not even more.

Geefje me some respect?

Will.

It's Will.

You're lucky
that Crow has brought the ointment.

I Gaje home.
Going home?

It's worth 1000 gold pieces.

What happens out there?

Nothing that you can do something,
Robert.

Where is Lady Spriggs?

Inside, I think. Why?

I have a piece of a sword for her.
