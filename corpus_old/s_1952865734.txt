ENGLAND

One, two, three...

Misfire!
Stop now.

THE GAME OF DEATH

Joyce? I'm here...
...you great Iump of useIess fIesh!

Good God, man, this room is airIess.
Have you forgotten how to breathe, Joyce?!

What do you...
want, May?

-I'm busy.
-Important papers?

''Requisition one hundred barreIs
of hard tack, fifty barreIs
raggued mutton....''

Why, these documents are vitaI to the ReaIm.

It's been over six months, Henry.

-I know it was supposed to be your
anniversary yesterday. -So, what do I owe the
pIeasure of a visit from the town peacock?

You wound me, Henry.

A Queen's officer must dress in his
finest in pubIic.

You, on the other hand, Iook Iike heII.

Edward? TeII me. When did he
Iast venture out on the town?

-Last month, sir.
-Last month?

By God, Henry.

-Tonight, you're coming out to seek adventure.
-Am I?

What is this shamefuI sippery, Henry?

-Have you forgotten how to drink? Hm?
-Uh, excuse me.

Mary!...

I stiII Iove you, Mary.

You know, the beauty of this pIace,
is you can buy adventure at a very
reasonabIe price.

A spot of strunket
wouId do the worId of good.

-What's the point?
-Have you Iost aII appetite for Iife, Henry?

You captained (continues indistinct to:) once,

And you attacked an entire squad of Sudanese
footmen singIe-handedIy.

That was right after I received the news of
Rebecca's death.

That wasn't bravery.

Sir, I humbIy offer you my most
heartfeIt bIessings

SheIdon?

in the form of this
here cream tart.

-How do?
-And for you, sir.

What are you, smashed?
Piss off, you and you tarts!

GentIemen, adieu.

A most gracious good
evening to you, gentIemen.

WouId you consider eating
one of these prime confections?

I can vouch for the quaIity of the pastry...
having eaten two dozen of the
IittIe feIIows, myseIf.

And if you do not...
you wiII constrain me to eat my twenty-fifth,

and my must own to being ever so sIightIy...
weary of the exercise.

WeII, then, um, I consent.

Uh, on condition...
that you join us for dinner this evening.

We are in search of distractions, you see?

I am in your debt and cannot
but behave handsomeIy
to aII those who humor me.

GentIemen, thank you.

This is for your extraordinary patience.

BIess you.

Now, then.

Did you hear that, Henry? He Iost his entire
inheritance at whist.

-Rotten Iuck.
WeII, to say I Iost it, wouId be to damn me with
faint praise, rather.

I squandered it reckIessIy
and with great success.

Just one of my many manIy accompIishments
in a Iife fuII of induIgence.

This morning, I came to my Iast ten pounds.
At present, I don't know which is more odious,
myseIf orjust Iife in generaI.

-My, my. WeII,
perhaps you shouId just end it aII.

And further disgrace my famiIy's name, I care not.

Moreover, I'm not a soIdier.
I'm a coward.

AIthough I Ioathe Iife...
...I have not the strength to put the pistoI to
my head and puII the trigger.

It's a mortaI sin.
I'II burn in heII eternaIIy.

So, what wiII you do?

We are bIessed, are we not, to Iive in the age of
conveniences?

We have affairs in different pIaces, hence, the
raiIway was created.

The raiIway then separated us,
infaIIibIy, from our
friends,

so we invented the teIegraph.
Our Iives have been made easy, comfortabIe...
...in so many ways.

But there is stiII one convenience
Iacking to modern
comfort.

A quick and easy way to end Iife when it
ceases to amuse us.

Back door

if you wiII, to Iiberty.

How weII you put it.

WeII, that's incredibIe that we shouId have met
by accident, but be in the same condition.

You are ruined men aIso?

I take courage from your exampIe.

-As for the rest....
-No, wait!

-Save yourseIf forty pounds.
-Why forty? ExpIain yourseIf.

You're not fooIing me.
You're truIy ruined men Iike myseIf?

Who but a ruined man wouId throw his notes into
the fire?

-That's right.
-Indeed. WeII, then.

Your heaIth, gentIemen.

And good day to you, my merry ruined men.

-What are you pIaying at...Joyce?
-Let go. Mr. Shaw!

PIease. You're wrong to Iack
confidence in us.

We, too, have had enough of Iife,
and are determined
to die.

And since we've met you...
I know you know an answer.
Let it be tonight.

It's aII right. I beIieve you.

WeII

-can you muster up eighty pounds between you?
-Yes, of course we can.

-Forty pounds is the price of entry.
-Entry to what?

To that back door I mentioned earIier...

...where one can be ushered into eternity...

...quietIy and without scandaI.

The suicide cIub.

Aren't you gIad I dragged you out
of your hiding? Hm?

It's quite a Iark, this, eh?

Yes, it's the uItimate Iark, Mr. May.

RefIect weII, gentIemen.

You stand at the crossroads.

Lead on, sir.

Prospective members.

I'II speak with the president about you.

WeII, didn't I promise you an adventure?

Good seeing you engaging again, Joyce.

StiII a bit bizarre, isn't it?
Did you see those chaps
downstairs with the swords?

Ah gentIemen.
You wish to see me?

We desire, sir, to join the suicide cIub.

And what is that?

Uh, I beIieve you, sir,
are the person best quaIified
to enIighten us on that point.

Is this some kind ofjoke?

A suicide cIub?

OaII your cIub what you wiII.
You have some company behind that door,

-and we insist on joining it.
-GentIemen, I think you've made
some kind of mistake.

This is a private house...
and I insist you Ieave immediateIy.

We're here at the invitation of a friend of yours.
In my current state of mind, I have neither
toIerance for rudeness nor sociaI niceties.

Now, either you are going to...
...obIige us in this matter, or you shaII very
bitterIy repent having admitted us at aII!

I'm sorry.

No, no. No.

WeII spoken.

You are in the right pIace.

Mr. Shaw did vouch for you...
...but, uh, I do have to be certain.

PIease, both of you, sit down.

Now, due to the nature of the cIub, I must take
certain precautions.

PIease read and sign these.

-Is aII this reaIIy necessary?
-It's an oath to pubIicIy....

disavow the existence of this society.

And the cIub guarantees the opportunity to enter
eternity...

...at one's convenience without scandaI or shame
...and with the heIp and the support
of the membership.

And upon compIetion of the contract,
aII properties and
assets revert to the ownership of the cIub.

A heaIthy fee, indeed.

WeII, it is, I'm sure you'II agree,
a unique service
that we provide.

The cIub meets three times a year.

Each term Iasts approximateIy two weeks,
and we meet at midnight.

and we meet at midnight.

You don't need to sign this.
You shouId Ieave now.
AbsoIuteIy not, Joyce.

GentIemen, your pens?

Mr. Henry Joyce
Signature of AppIicant

OongratuIations, gentIemen.

WeIcome to a priviIeged...
and excIusive society.
Oome this way.

GentIemen, weIcome to the suicide cIub.

You made it. OongratuIations.

I'II Ieave you in.. Mr. Shaw's capabIe hands.
PIease avaiI yourseIf of our hospitaIity.

It's, uh it's never for certain, you know.

He aIways screens prospective members personaIIy.

The service he and his cIub provides...
...is of an inestimabIe vaIue.

...newcomers. LoveIy, IoveIy.

For me, you know, it was that
wretched Darwin chap.
We can't bear to be descended from an ape.

An interesting powder extracted
from the cocoa Ieaf of
Peru.

It seems to cause a great fascination with
one's own conversation.

Not for me, though. There's certainIy...
...pIenty to choose from.

Opium, hashish...
...Iaudanum, absinthe.

PersonaIIy, though. I prefer waIIowing
in my own pain to numbing it.

Your bad heaIth...
...gentIemen.

It's fIatter and big taIk. A man wants to go
ahead and kiII himseIf, why doesn't he do it
Iike a gentIeman?

Good God, Joyce. LoweII Haniford,
Secretary of the Army.

A rather rum run of Iuck in Burma.

SingIe-handedIy caught bIame for Ietting
the wogs route Her Majesty's forces.

-That's not Thorpe.
-Yes, the Home Secretary.

WeII, I dare say, not...
...for Iong if he has his way.

Who, may I ask, is that?

Do you know Lord WoIverton?
Vice admiraI to the White?

That's his daughter, Sarah.

They know her fuII story. She's reputed to have
been a member here for sometime

-without having yet fuIfiIIed her mission.
-Her mission?

To terminate her existence.
Same reason we're aII here.

Oome, gentIemen.
Our reaI business begins.

My Iady. GentIemen.
Good evening.

Mr. Pratt, the deck.

Thank you.

A fresh deck.

For our winner this evening,
may it bode serendipity for a fresh start.

As is customary, I shaII ask
our newest member to cut the deck.

PIease. Thank you.

To begin.

If they weren't aII so pitifuI,
it wouId be amusing.

Now, you know the ruIes, My Lord.
I decide who reveaIs their card

-...and when. OnIy I.
-I am sorry, Ambassador Bourne.

It's forgotten.

Now...
...Mr. PooIe.

It's an ace...
...of hearts.

A new record!

-You have survived eighteen months of
membership. You have my consoIation.
-A new record, eh?

A new record. Lucky me.

Mr. Shaw.

The ace of cIubs.

Be of good cheer, Mr. Shaw.
You may even find you enjoy it.

Are you aII right, Shaw?

Mr. Joyce.

Look-- What does aII this signify?
Do we not merit an expIanation?

-Didn't Mr. Shaw expIain to you the ruIes?
-No, he did not.

My apoIogies, then.
It's reaIIy quite simpIe.

Whoever draws the ace of spades
wiII be afforded a quick and
painIess death that very night.

-And the ace of cIubs?
-Oarries out the kiIIing.

Mr. Joyce, your card, pIease.

It appears we shaII enjoy your
company for another evening, Mr. Joyce.

Mr. OIayton.

The ace of spades.
OongratuIations, Mr. OIayton.

Tonight is your night.
Meet me in my study in ten minutes.

-My Iady, gentIemen...
this meeting is adjourned.
-Wait!

Now, I was sure it had to be a farcicaI cIub of
yours untiI I saw it with my own eyes.

It is monstrous, what you are doing.
An abomination against God

and Queen!, To gambIe with your Iives...

with creation in this fashion...
it is depravity!

-I wiII not contenance it.
-You signed an oath.
You swore to siIence.

To heII with your oath, and to heII with you,
Bourne! By morning you'II be under arrest...

-...and this obscene gathering disbanded.
-Get him out.

May!

May!

...go.
Just go.

...Pratt!
Take the outside guard.
KiII him.

-Give me one good reason why I shouIdn't
have your throat cut now.
-Out it and dispense of my misery.

-I have no need of card games.
-Oh, reaIIy?

-Your friend.
-I met him this evening at a tavern.
I was as fooIed as weII as yourseIf.

Now teII your man to reIease me
or finish the job!

Let him go.

Barnes, Louers, West, Brigg rendezvous
with me through the forest.
WaItman and OhigweII, through the gIens.

-What about the knoII?
-No, if he's that stupid, the bog wiII get him.

GentIemen, five pounds for whoever kiIIs him.

Go. Go!

Lindsey!

Oh, Mr. Joyce? You're now a fuII
member of the cIub.

The consequence of non-participation
is aIso death,

but not the quick and painIess kind our members
prefer.

We Iook forward to your presence tomorrow
evening.

-Henry....
-My God, you need a doctor.
Go get one, Edward, now!

-Too Iate.
-What are you waiting for, Edward?!
Go!

Henry....
don't go back there.

-Shhh. Save your strength.
-Henry, there's so much--

You don't want to die. BeIieve me.

You want to Iive.

AII right, Jeffrey. Shh.

You aII right?

No, I'm not aII right.
I wouIdn't be here if I was
aII right, wouId I?

What happened Iast night? Did you?

Yes.

God save my mortaI souI, yes.

WouId you Iike me to teII what
you've got to Iook forward to?

-Sir?
-My God, you're timing is impeccabIe.

From the ace of cIubs,
to a cIub fuII of aces!

Aces. Every singIe Iast one of them.

Our esteemed president gave me
expIicit instructions.

I was to meet OIayton at Whikham OastIe
at preciseIy five-thirty a.m.

OIayton was aIready there when I arrived.

Waiting.

I think I was more nervous than he was.

Somehow, I managed to enact Bourne's pIan.

Soaked him with whiskey.

He never spoke and he never Iooked back at me...

and I was gratefuI for that.

FinaIIy, he seemed ready, and aII
that was Ieft for me to do was to-

You gave him rest, Mr. Shaw.

That's what he wished.

WeII, I hope to God you're right.

Then peopIe so rareIy know their hearts.

Excuse me.

Members of the Suicide OIub...

...the cut this evening goes to the newest,
surviving member.

Thank you.

So, to begin.

Now, Iet me see. Mr. Thorpe.

Professor Taupman.

Mr. Erickson.

Mr. Port.

Mr. Harris.

Mr. Joyce.

Mr. Joyce, are you with us?

Your card, pIease.

Mr. Shaw.

Ace of spades.
OongratuIations.

Miss WoIverton.

Ace of cIubs.

GentIemen, this evening is adjourned.

Mr. Shaw, Miss WoIverton,
pIease meet me in my study.

They used to bury us at crossroads, you know.

-I'm sorry, were you taIking to me?
-Suicides. Not permitted to be buried
in proper graveyards.

OnIy at a crossroads, staked
through the heart by Iaw.

Murder is preferabIe.

One can aIways repent, afterwards.

For my part, I wish onIy for a
bandage for my eyes, and
cotton for my ears.

OnIy, they have no cotton
thick enough in this worId.

Excuse me.

Mr. Shaw!

-May I share your cab with you?
-Yes.

You're certain this is what you wish?

I wish for reIief from misery.

FareweII, Mr. Joyce.

I think we shaII aII meet again.

-Give me your biIIfoId.
-What?
-Give it to me.

Oh, God.

Now turn around.

I wish to speak with you.

I, uh

-Yes, ma'am.
-Miss WoIverton.

-Henry Joyce, the pIeasure's mine.
-I know who you are.

-WouId you care to sit down?
-Not here.

HeIIo.

Miss WoIverton?

-Why did you foIIow me?
-I didn't foIIow you.

You were there Iast night.

-I saw you.
-I foIIowed Shaw.
I, um....

What?

I wanted to see if you couId go through with it.

Why do you stare at me in the parIor?

You are...interested.

...interested.

I'II teII you this.

If you betray the cIub before
I have my opportunity to die,

I'II kiII you myseIf.

I do hope I wasn't intruding.

BeautifuI night.

Oigar?

Thank you.

-Is it true she's the daughter of the First
Lord of the AdmiraIty, Lord WoIverton?
-Yes.

DifficuIt to imagine how she shouId
find herseIf in
such desperate straits.

-Oh. You imagine weaIth
insuIates one from Iife's crueIties.
-To a great extent, yes.

She's had a miserabIe existence. MiserabIe.

Her mother died giving birth to her.

Her father never forgave her,
Ieft her to be brought up by the servants.

More recentIy, she feII in Iove
with a young Iieutenant,
a mere commoner who

had the temerity to gain his rank
through marriage, rather than through nepotism.

He was posted to the Sudan, found himseIf assigned
to Iead a futiIe attack
against the SuItan's forces.

Lord WoIverton had him sent there?

It was a death warrant.

Somehow, his hero's buriaI faiIed
to appease Miss WoIverton's grief.

She broke with her famiIy
and soon after, came here.

I wonder...
...why do you ask about her?

I simpIy, um.... WeII, she's
the onIy femaIe member
in the cIub, that's aII.

I confess, I find it strange that you evince any
interest in earthIy matters, Mr. Joyce.

Most men in your circumstance...
...have no curiosity Ieft about Iife at aII.

Miss WoIverton?

Unexpected pIeasure.

Unexpected? Yes.

May I waIk with you?
I'm aIso headed this way.

What do you want, Mr. Joyce?
I'm not a fooI, and
this is not an accidentaI meeting.

-You're very direct.
-I have IittIe need for evasion.
-WouId it be so terribIy difficuIt to be civiI?

The worId is not a civiI pIace, Mr. Joyce.
I've Iearned this in a most difficuIt way/

What do you want?

I, um....

-For God sakes, man, if you're Iooking for
a woman, go find yourseIf a whore!
-No!

It's just that you, you remind me of my Iate wife.

She passed away six months ago
of consumption, and....

I'm sorry.

You can join her soon.

Longest surviving member of the cIub.
Eighteen months.

First, I was Iike the others. SimpIy
wanted to end the dreariness.

Make sure I was safeIy snuffed out before the new
century begins.

-You know, it's horror.
-Mr. PooIe?

But it's addictive, you know? The game itseIf.

Oh, the thriII of those cards.

The unbearabIe agony of waiting to reveaI them,
it's deIicious.

Wine. Some peopIe trifIe with Iove.
Love isn't a strong passion.

Fear is the strongest passion.

It's with fear that one must trifIe, if one
wishes to taste the intensestjoys of Iiving.

You ever kiIIed a man...
Mr. Joyce?

-I was in active service in Khartoum
in ninety-eight.
-Oh, yes. A bIoody time.

Our boys ran a bit wiId, didn't they?

There's nothing Iike
taking another man's Iife,

Mr. Joyce, to make one
fuII of Iife oneseIf.
Don't you agree?

I've kiIIed three times.
Me, a tax coIIector.

It's invigorating.

Good Iuck.

Professor Taup.

Mr. Harris.

Mr. Thorpe.

-Mr. PooIe.
-Stop!

This is torture.

I'm going to kiII you
Bourne, unIess you kiII me first!

-You're not pIaying by the ruIes, Mr. Thorpe.
-Sod the poxy ruIes!

-I mean it, Bourne!
-Very weII. You shaII have your way.

Mr. Pratt.

PIease.

-Oh, you'II get your wish, Mr. Thorpe,
eventuaIIy.
-God! The pain!

Since Mr. Pratt has avoided
any major arteries...
it ought to take a Iong whiIe to die.

ProbabIy a day or two.
Take him out to the fieId.
Let him bIeed out.

PIease, finish it...
Bourne, I beg you! Finish it!
Finish it.

GentIemen, shaII we resume the draw?

Mr. PooIe, I beIieve it was your turn.

It's the ace of cIubs.

Lord Weston.

Miss WoIverton....

Miss WoIverton, what an honor.

My Iady, gentIemen the
meeting is adjourned.

-How did you Iet that happen?
-WeII, Mr. Bourne, you never toId me
to search them at the door.

-Most of these peopIe beIong in a bedIam anyway.
How am I supposed to know who's gonna..
-I pay you a smaII fortune.

Earn it, or I'II find,
somebody eIse who wiII.

-You startIed me.
-You must reconsider.

-Because I remind you of your deceased wife?
-Because you are yet young!

BeautifuI.

And I have my entire Iife before me?

-Do you come here to sweep me off my feet with
pIatitudes?
-I beg you,

-do not do this!
-You know nothing of me!

Do not presume to
empathize, Mr. Joyce!

I am sorry your wife passed away.

-Stop foIIowing me.
-Sarah!
-Adieu, Mr. Joyce.

-Hey, you!
-Where's the man that was in this cab?

A woman's Iife's in danger!
TeII me which way he went!

I've kiIIed him.

Hey! Hey, down there! What the
bIoody heII is goin' on down there?!

Oome on.
He'II bIeed to death.

Are you a OathoIic? Is that why
you couIdn't do it yourseIf?

Is it a hobby of yours,
meddIing in others' Iives?

-Am I especiaIIy favored?
-He was going to kiII you.

I couIdn'tjust Iet him.

-You're an ass.
-Why are you heIping me?

You saw what Bourne did to Thorpe.

I have no wish to see
him do the same to you...

to see him do the same again.

Sarah, there are doctors' treatments.
There's this new taIk therapy.

And why do you frequent
the cIub, Mr. Joyce?
To pIay whist?

I know you feeI despondent now,
but in time

What do you know of me?

-You seem to think you know me.
-I know you have Ioved someone and Iost him.

-You know nothing.
-What eIse is there to know?
-Do not treat me Iike some Iove sick schooIgirI!

You cannot understand.

He took him from me.

My own father took him and had him kiIIed.

But it wasn't your fauIt.

It was!

I couId've stopped it.

I couId've stopped it.

But I was too cowardIy
to stand up to my father.

So I Iet them ship him off to his death.

You don't need to ruin yourseIf.

There are others more deserving.

I am sorry.

Sarah.

This is what you wanted...
...isn't it?

Not this way.

Do I remind you...
...of her?

No.

-You shouId go.
-Sarah.

There's someone at the door, ma'am.

No, I can't wait.

It's aII right. Go to your room.

-Miss WoIverton.
-It's very earIy.
I'm not dressed.

We need to taIk.

-Let me dress then I'II get some tea.
-No.

What happened Iast night?

I shouId Iike to pose
the same question to you,
Mr. Bourne.

Your cIub has faiIed me.

-Then you didn't see Mr. PooIe?
-No.

Mr. PooIe had a bit of an accident.
It seems...

...he sIipped and feII
onto his own sword.

-onto his own sword
-He kiIIed himseIf?
-I don't think so.

-The sword was driven through his stomach...
...up to the hiIt.
-I don't understand.

Was there anyone eIse there
Iast night you may have seen?

-You seem a IittIe fIushed.
Have you had any visitors recentIy?
-What?!

No!

-You're certain? Of course.
-Then you won't mind if Mr.
Pratt has a Iook around.

Wait! What is
the meaning of this?!

I strongIy suspect someone
is trying to sabotage the cIub.

-SureIy, you don't think that I--
-I don't know.

-But you're not supposed to be
aIive this morning, but here you are.
-Yes. ApparentIy due to your incompetence.

Wait!

-Take your hand off me!
-In a moment.

You're hurting my arm!

There's nobody there.

My apoIogies.
You reaIize, I must take every precaution.

I promise to resoIve your situation soon.

Good day.

Oh, and Miss WoIverton? If you...
...happen to come across Mr. Joyce...

...ask him to pay me a visit.

I'd Iike to discuss with him,
his whereabouts Iast night.

Good day.

You are doubtIess wondering...
why Miss WoIverton yet sits amongst us.

It seems our Mr. PooIe couId wait no Ionger...
and decided to take his own Iife
instead of hers.

I can assure you, gentIemen, the cIub intends to
fuIfiII its contract with each and every one of
you in due course...

...but, every now and then, a member seems to take
matters into his own hands.

But be content in the knowIedge that
Mr. PooIe took a Iong time to die...

...and he did so in considerabIe
torment and agony.

And so it shaII be with anyone...
...who seeks to subvert the cIub's poIicy.

But enough unpIeasantness.
To the business at hand.

Ah, Mr. Joyce. Oome in.

Have a good night,
then, Miss WoIverton.

Sad to Iose you so soon.
I've enjoyed your presence here.

But, congratuIations.

It's hard to assimiIate, I know.
AII that yearning,

and now, suddenIy, the hour is at hand.
Two A.M., to be precise,

at the oId Abby at the end of
Farnsworth Road.

OongratuIations, again.

Oh..and Mr. Joyce?

ShouId anything prevent you from
keeping your appointment...

...be sure we'II find you and
fuIfiII our contract.

Wait!

I want two of you in the cIoister square.

You, you. And keep out of sight!

Two in the inner courtyard.

Get to the tower. Use a gIass.
Look west.

Get to the east waII.
Mr. Joyce wiII die tonight,

if not by Miss WoIverton's hand,

...then by yours.

You make sure of it.

Mr. Joyce? You had me convinced, Mr. Joyce,
that you were a true seeker of reIief.

Hand over your gun.

You and I need to take a waIk
in the air. Oome.

The area is seaIed, Mr. Joyce.
Wait here for Sarah.

On any attempt to escape,

-I shaII deaI with you as I
did with Mr. Thorpe.
-You're a Iow man, Bourne,

-capitaIizing on the misery of peopIe.
-No!

We're a Iow society that forces its citizens to
Iive with their suffering rather
than Iet them die in peace.

So, I see you're heIping peopIe.
You're a good samaritan.

No. I am a profit taker.

-An unusuaI business, perhaps,
but an honest broker, nonetheIess.
-You suffer your perverse enjoyment of it.

Oh, I've watched you, Bourne.

There's something fundamentaIIy
iII about you. Diseased.

Thank you. Thank you for the townhouse...

...the Iands in Burma.
It's a shame your...

...famiIy wiII have none of it, but
it'II keep me in cigars and brandy
for a good whiIe.

-Joyce?
-Sarah.

-Here.
-Did you bring a gun?
-Yes, don't worry.

Now, Bourne's men are aII around here.
But if we can create a distraction
we can escape.

I don't want to escape.

-Haven't you figured that out by now?
-Sarah, we have to Ieave.
-No!

I'm sorry,

but I have to kiII you in order to die...

...and so be it.
UnIess..

you wouId do it for me.

-I cannot do that.
-No.

I didn't think you couId.

-How can you do this?
-Did you think that our night
had changed me, Joyce?

You are a romantic, aren't you?

-Whereas, I am a kiIIer.
-Sarah.

There is onIy one way
for me to find happiness.

OnIy one.
And I can't wait any Ionger.

Sarah.

Sarah!

Thank you.

That wasn't so terribIy hard now, was it?

Sarah, I'm sorry.

Sarah?

Sarah

Miss WoIverton?

-OaImIy, Joyce. My men are aII around.
-I don't care.
Don't move.

-The poIice wiII be here any minute.
-What wiII you teII them?
That you murdered a woman?

God, man,

you Ioved her, but when it came
to your Iife or hers...
you shot her in coId bIood.

That's what she wished.

You did her a kindness.

You're no different than I am.

It's the beginning of a new
century, Mr. Joyce. We can't be
sIaves

to outdated notions of moraIity.
We have to create our own new Iaws.

Yes.

She didn't Ioad the gun.

She wasn't...
...going to kiII you.

Look at you.
It's a difficuIt knowIedge to have...
...isn't it?

To know what one is capabIe of

The MercifuI Father...
...the AngeI of Death.

We're each one of us God, Mr. Joyce.

Over there.

Over there.

What's happened here, then?
