the senator

and 2nd and 3rd platoon
will confront the gangsters

ls that clear?
Yes, sir!

Get ready for combat!

Headquarters!

Headquarters! Why did
the train just pass by?

Connect the engine room

321 ! 321 !

Reconnect the phone!

Why don't you

give'em another call
and ask'em for an entire division?

Don't worry...'

cause they'll place
forces at every stop anyway

Hundreds of people could die

lf we all die, it's all senator
Park's fault Got that?

We'll all just crash and die

You didn't know?

l'm fine... let me go
You really shouldn't.../- Off of me

Do something ,

or else we might all die

Kyung-bu line's trains,
make a detour immediately

Get off the rail right now!

Kyung-bu line's trains,
make a detour immediately

Get off the rail right now!

Sending in the rangers to a train

that's traveling at 140km/h
is way too risky

Can't even get close to...
lf we blow up the link between

the engine car and coach ,
the train might derail

Considering the speed of
the train

using a sniper is
again not realistic

Well then find a way!

What? Oh yeah?

Hmmm...

Right on

The police soccer tournament

has been postponed they say

What's wrong with you?

ls that important right now?
Wake the fuck up!

Captain...

We can't just get
fucked over like this

Let's show'em what we got

Let's do it!
Come on now...

Hold on a second
Just one second... wait

What? Why wait?

We should calm down and carefully
think over what we're about to do

Shit happens sometimes so

maybe it's best if we just wait

Shut the fuck up Let's go!

What the...

Open the door
Open it

Open the door
Hey, open the door!

Boss, that crazy son of a bitch
brought hundreds of people

What about our boys?

Talk to me shithead !

if we took all our boys

Things getting tough

and broke the window
and entered
