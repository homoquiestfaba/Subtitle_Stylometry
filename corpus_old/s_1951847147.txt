I have always been my worst enemy.

Oh, my god, you are so late.

Hudson Milbank.
God, you're so late.

Even on the most important day on my career.

I felt overwhelmed
by the uncertainty of what I have.

I wasn't the same person anymore.

I was now living in some kind of
horrific perpetual dream state,

yet somehow still able to interact
without anyone knowing.

Just going through emotions, on automatic.

I'm afraid I will never get out of this.

My life view was simple.

One, I just wanted to be a
happy person with happy thoughts.

Two, we were all a simple action
away from complete disaster.

You should slow down man.

But I didn't want to slow down.

I just want to stop my recent thoughts,

constant worry and never ending anxiety.

Little did I know that inhaling a harmless
joint twelve times in twelve minutes.

could unhinge an already vulnerable brain
and send it to the bottom of the abyss.

Jesus Christ.

Jesus.

You just smoked too much.

Jesus Christ!
You'll be OK.

From that point onward I
would suffer from a symptom

so frightening that it
would consume every minute

of every hour of every day.

The official name was depersonalization.

No matter what I did, it wouldn't go away.

So what was it exactly?

Depersonalization disorder,
in brief, involves the

persistent or recurrent
experience of feeling detached,

as if one was an outside observer
of one's mental processes or body.

The sense that the external
world was unreal is strange.

Like living in some hellish dream like state.

In layman's terms, I was fucked.

Can you hear that?

Yes, I did. Is that bad?

Put your arms to your side.

Now touch your nose with your forefingers.

Now you can open your eyes.
You're fine.

That's impossible.

I never joke about the head, son.

My finger hit my nostril,
did you catch that?

It was close enough.

But what about the nothing's real part?

Perhaps you should see a
psychiatrist or something?

I also live substantially below my means.

Not what I was cheap,
I was just terrified that

things get so bad that I
wouldn't be able to function.

So I opened up my checkbook and found myself
in the office of a west-side psychiatrist

who's specialized in dealing with creative
types on the verge of losing their minds.

Have you ever heard the word dysphoric?

I knew it,
I've somehow gone crazy.

That's psychotic.

Dysphoric is when you just
don't feel right in your own skin.

Wait a minute, say that again.

Over the next week, I couldn't
stop talking about that word.

It means I don't feel
comfortable in my own skin.

Tom was my writing partner for seven years.

We complemented each other perfectly.

He considered himself the writer of the team.

I was just the hustler.

Even in my state,
I could sell better than he could.

So how's the detachment thing?

You could jam this fork into my eye
socket right now and I wouldn't feel it.

but you're gonna be
ok for next week?

I'm suffering here.

Now, but this isn't important.

Why did I have to smoke the pot?

We had to sell something.

I mean, I didn't even
touch a drug in high school.

So you've been washing them down with pills.

So, between now and then, I'm really gonna
need you to put down that fork.

I could have just taken one or
two hits like a normal person,

I smoked the whole thing.

It's not the pot,
I smoked pot every day in my life

and I never stirred a cutlery.

Hey, do you have a turkey burger?

Fuck!

Alright, alright.

What about the shrink?
Is he any good?

He went to Harvard.

Are things getting better now?

It's great.
What's he say?

He thinks it might be a
good idea for my self-Esteem

if we switched the order of our
names on every other screenplay.

He's an asshole,
a Harvard asshole.

Also I watched the golf
channel for 23 hours yesterday.

Why golf?

I don't know. I find it comforting.
It's green. People are whispering.

So you are not getting out at all?

Look, I think this is
something a little bit

more than just being
uncomfortable in my own skin.

What do I do? Tell me what to do.

Hudson, it's important that you socialize,

even if you have to force yourself.

I read on the pamphlet from
the National Mental Association,

that after 12 weeks of psycho-therapy,
if you are not better, seek another therapist.

I was on week 14 with Dr. Townsend.

But we'd became more like friends,
so I didn't mind.

So the S, that's for Scott, right?

Yes.

Can I call you that?
No.

One way to survive the endless
time between therapy sessions

was to distract myself with the
longest running movies ever made.

These are due back Thursday.

What if I watch them all tonight?

Ok.

Dr. Townsend.

Wow, I can't believe I'm bumping into you.
How are you?

Fine.

I was just at the video store.

Hey.

Well, I guess I will go home and wait for
our next appointment. It's tomorrow, right?

Fine.

Patient.

The one thing that Townsend
did give me was Climesipan.

The directions read, taken
as needed, which for me

was Monday to Friday and weekends.

One blue pill was the equivalent
of three domestic beers.

Two pills cut my feelings
of hopelessness by a third.

More was needed if you were, say, rejected
by a shrink you were trusting your life with.

I adore the sedation
but there was one drawback.

Sexual dysfunction.

It got so bad, the average
sexual act did nothing for me.

I had to find the most
extreme twenty seconds of footage

and play it over and
over until it did the trick.

"Oh, fuck me with your tongue."

Despite the restaurant snub, I decided
to give Dr. Townsend another shot.

After all, he was out with
friends and that had nothing

to do with his dedication
to me within our sessions.

Go on.

I guess this is... boring you.

Excuse me?

You kind of... fell asleep there.

No.

You were snoring.

I was listening.

Because last night, I was
in the bath, I figured out

that I already spent $2650 on sessions
and I still feel crazier than I ever did,

so if you were snoring...

I think you are making this
bigger than it needs to be, Hudson.

You'd also think those kind of prices if
we ran into each other at the restaurant,

you'd acknowledge me as
something more than patient.

Perhaps we should talk about this.

Perhaps?

Obviously you're upset.

I think I am a little
upset because... I rely on you.

You are my touchstone to mental
health and I think we have kind of a bond...

Fuck me!

Intense exercise was
my next course of action.

I read that if you could
raise your endorphins high enough,

somehow they could alter
your brain chemistry.

I found a class packed with lesbians.

Not by choice, but still
it was strangely comforting.

We need to go one more time,
so let's push it.

Everybody down!

After 30 minutes, I thought
something might actually be happening.

but it was a wishful
psychosomatic false alarm.

My legs might as well have been
attached to one of the lesbians.

I didn't know where else to turn.

I hadn't been home in five years.

Maybe some family reconnection was
what I needed to snap me back to normal.

What's this spaciness with Sport?

It's anxiety, that is all it is.

Oh my goodness.

Sport?

I desperately wanted my dad's help

but he was the king of pragmatic thinking.

I got the same kind of
advise to all my worries.

Do you think it was the pot?
I mean, why did I have to smoke so much?

Just pull up your socks,
you'll be ok.

I thought about reaching
out to my older brother Stan,

who I worshiped since I was a kid.

I'm busy.

Can I at least get a glass
of water before I ride back?

I'm in the middle of a writing session,
there's a gas station on the corner.

Sport?

I can't breathe.

What is it?
He says he can't breathe.

For goodness sake.
Stop acting like a child!

I think that's enough, Sport.

Re-connecting wasn't the answer.
I had to get back to LA and somehow heal myself.

Come on.
Get up! Get UP!

Ok, got to get you dressed,
got a meeting in thirty.

What do you think,
jeans and T-Shirt today?

I'm dying here.

Alright, then I'll drive.

I have to sleep.

How about this shirt?
Look at this.

Oh my god.
You kidding me?

I can't, I can't do this.

Of course you can. The shirt
goes on top, watch this move.

Pants, big surprise to
everyone, go on the bottom.

Right? We've got leg crossed,
leg crossed the pant.

Where are the shoes? Got to have shoes.
You know why? Cause we're going outside.

That's right. You are handsome man,
I am gonna

wait in the car.
We got to get this job, buddy.

So how are you doing now?

But that's better than in the car, right?

Can you just fight this
until after the meeting?

No, but I think I can manage it.

Ok, that's all I need.

He's ready for you.

Sorry I'm late.

Fuck.

For some reason,
just looking at her jolted me

into a state of awareness
and back to the job at hand.

So would you like the $50 million version
or the $100 million version?

That girl is an angel.

What? Who?

The development girl.

Oh no. No, no, no.
Please god no.

What?

Remember the last kid, the copy girl.

The flower, the rain,
obsessing of her with zeal.

We worked for a year after that.

Well, there's something
different about this girl.

Alright, maybe there is

something very
different about this girl.

Just, there's also something very different
about the money coming in.

OK?

Hello, is Hudson there?

Is this Hudson?

Yes, who is this?

Sara Harrison.

Who?

I was in the executive U&MI office today,
sitting next to my boss.

Yes, hi, this is him.

I hope it's ok I'm calling.
Yes, sure, of course.

I was wondering if you
want to get together.

You and me?
Uh-huh.

When?

Just an ordinary, everyday spoon.
You've seen it a thousand times.

Just an ordinary piece
of kitchen cutlery, see?

Pretty impressive,
where'd it go?

That's magic.

In your lap?

That's a stupid trick, really.

You know, I've seen you before
at a party a couple of weeks ago.

You were sitting on a couch by yourself
and this dog came up to you.

You fed it a potato chip.

You looked really lonely.

No, that's just the way that I appear
when I am really enjoying myself.

You seemed really anxious to leave.

I did?

There's some fucking noticeable about you.

So sweet.

I cuss when I get excited about things.

That's ok.

My god, she was fantastic.

And by dessert, things loosened up when she
started talking about her last relationship.

So he took a gun out
of his glove compartment

and blew his brains
out all over his Porche,

in front of his ex-wife.

But she was obviously attracted
to unstable guys, which was perfect.

What's your biggest fear?

I have two.

The first is that I'm spontaneously insane.

And the second is... 
something happening to my father.

Like him dying?

I really wish... you wouldn't say it.

You're afraid of the word?

Yeah, for some reason I
think the saying it might...

...make it happen.

Yeah.

It won't.

Death, death, death, die, die, die.
See... nothing.

Right, you're saying it.
Nothing's gonna happen when you're saying it.

That's the way my mind works.

I figured it out the other day that
life expectancy for a male is 72 years.

That's 25,000 days and you sleep a
third of that, so that's just 16,000 days.

Say you spend half of that
time trying to figure out what

you want to do with your
life. That's another 8,000 days.

Now I am 36, so that leaves
me only 4,311 days left.

If I don't get sick or
hit by a bus or something.

You're an unusual person.

My father is a physicist,
he teaches stream theory.

That's interesting.

Can I come in?

Oh, I would.

What's the deal with him?

He likes me.

Really?

He leaves Cd's on my car...

People always look at the numbers changing.
Yep.

I think it's because they're nervous.
Yep.

So what'd you think?

This sounds good.

Seriously?

It's the worst playing of any
musical instrument I've ever heard.

Really, you should throw
that thing into the fireplace.

Where did you get all of this stuff?

What is that?

A turtle.

I broke its head off.
I was watching the basketball players,

the fucking team didn't win,
so I threw remote control to the TV and it...

I can see that.
You are insanely cute.

You think I am cute.

I kind of think I have a big head.

Well, at least you have a chin.

Look at this, straight line from my
chin to my neck, it's like a chineck.

I think that one of my ears
is bigger than the other.

I don't see that.

Liars go to hell.

Yeah, I see that.

You really have no chin.

Well, you kind of look like a lion.

You kind of look like an owl,
an owl without a chin.

I have to go.

Where?

I have an appointment tomorrow.

I have to do something I forgot.

What the devil is this?

Did I just fuck this up?

I'm gonna call you,
so be ready for that.

You do kind of look like an owl.

So you really like this girl?

How is that?

It was the worst lawn bowling
I've ever seen in my entire life.

I think you should take the ball
and throw it into my fireplace.

Over the next a few days, she was
able to drag me outside during the day.

Luckily we did the things almost
just comforting as the golf channel.

Nights were the worst
for me, so I convinced

her to stay in and watch
the extended version of

Lawrence of Arabia,
Bridge on the River Kwai,

and the Right Stuff,
which we saw twice.

She seemed perfectly fine.

At this rate I could stay in
my comfort zone indefinitely.

I think we should go out tonight.
Out?

I though we were going to watch the
Star Wars Trilogy with the commentary.

I know watching the Star Wars
Trilogy with the commentary is fine,

but I was thinking maybe we
could do something different.

So even though the Millennium
Falcon was the oldest plane,

it ended up making it home.

Yeah, it did.

I am thinking of getting
a new car, by the way.

Really? Why?

I just don't want you to think I'd
like driving something ten years old.

A lot of people in LA don't have insurance.
So they don't care if they crash into you.

You don't have to impress me, Hudson.

And I am looking at homes.
Yeah?

Let's go there.

You ok? Yeah. You?
Yeah.

It's impressive.

I think you should give her $5.
$5?

Yep.

I only have a 20.

I'll pay you back.

You should wash your hands.

I am gonna go get some hand-sanitizers.

OK.

What if there weren't locks
and stores open twenty...

Do you steal a lot?

What stealing?
The pen...

No, I paid for that.

Don't lie.
Fucking hate that.

Why do you do it?

I don't know.
Yeah, you do.

Maybe it gives me a... well, sense of control.

I can't date somebody that does that.

It's only small stuff.
Doesn't matter, it's not right.

I know.
You do?

Yes...
and it will absolutely not happen again.

You just saying that to get off the hook?

You returned it?

Like it never happened.

Thank you, Hudson

No, thank you. Stealing is
bad, I don't want to be bad.

You do realize that we
haven't had sex yet?

Yes, I'm aware of that.

Will you take me back to your place?

Mine?

It's kind of like a ski lodge.

Oh, it is very chalet like.

You rent this place?

I do pay a monthly fee.

What the fuck was that?

No, you're ok.
It's just a family of squirrels.

Can I get you anything?

What you got?

I have pasta.

I don't have any sauce, but would
you like me to make you some pasta?

That's really sweet,
the way you say it.

So...
how about some bottled water?

Ok, here is the deal with that,

I don't really keep the bottled
water in the house cause I believe

that it's a scam. See, tap water has to
undergo much stringent testing for bacteria.

Tap's good.

Hudson, what are you looking
for in a relationship?

Ah well, basically somebody you can
stand being with me, I guess... Here.

You?

I want to know that if my limbs fall off,
we'd still be together no matter what.

And when he says my name,
it sounds different from his mouth.

You know you get safe there.

Or... I put on perfume, he puts on Cologne,
and we go out, we could smell each other.

He can make you smile when you are tired.

That's a big one.

And you tell him something,

you're scared to tell
him because you're

afraid that maybe he'll stop loving you,

but when you tell him, you are surprised
because actually it makes him love you more.

Or, you tell him that you love his
shirt and he ends up wearing it every day.

My greatest example is my grandparents.

My grandma has arthritis in her hand

and she can't bend down and paint her toenails,

so my grandfather does it for her,

all the time.

Even though he has
arthritis in his hands, too.

So do you like the place?

I like you.

What are you doing?

You can't sleep?

You want to turn on the TV?

How many girls could fall asleep
to the Greater Hartford Open.

Maybe a lot, but this was
the first one I ever met.

I never want to see you back here, never again.
You understand?

I couldn't hide my
condition from her forever.

If I had any chance with Sara,
I had to speed up my recovery.

So I went with another doctor
specialized in a big word

which meant fuck talking, take drugs.

So Dr... Richmond, here's the thing.

I have met and, I think, fallen in
love with the most beautiful,

incredible, weird, woman
on the face of the planet.

And she's so pretty.

She thinks she's a big head,
but she doesn't.

And last night, we consummated
our relationship, which is to say

that I had sex. We had sex.

And it should've felt really good

but I was so focused
on... renouncing the pen I stole,

which she saw me steal, but
I told her I'd returned it

But I didn't return it.
I just stole another pen.

So all that was flying through
my brain when I was supposed to...

So fucking help... help. Fuck!

On a crowded elevator, do you
stand at the back or the front?

What?

On a crowded elevator, do you
step at the back or the front?

Back... Front.

Although sometimes I found myself...
looking up at the numbers cause I get nervous.

Do you ever hear voices
coming from your television?

That are not part of the show?
Yeah. - No.

I think we will begin with Divalproic Sodium

What's an Divalproic Sodium?

Technically, an anti-psychotic.

Psychotic? I'm psychotic?

No.

Because I feel psychotic, sometimes.

The fact you are asking the
question proves that you are not.

Then why am I taking psychotic medication?

Because in small doses, it
can be quite helpful with

your mood, which I think is
contributing to your problem.

But I thought that's why I'm on Chlorazipan.

Did someone from Harvard prescribe them?

Yes.

Idiots.

You stop that immediately.

Is this gonna help with
my depersonalization?

That's what we're gonna find out.

Well, what about the side effects?

Nothing to be concerned about.

Have you taken an anti-psychotic before?

No, I'm not psychotic.

I already asked if I'm a psychotic

and apparently that proves
that I'm not psychotic.

I'm taking it for depersonalization.

Are you aware of the side effects?

I was told there is nothing
to be concerned about.

Blurred vision, constipation, dry eyes, dry
nose, dry mouth, difficulty in urinating.

Nothing to be concerned about.

Tardive dyskinesia. A permanent
twitching of the facial muscles.

Fuck.

My alternatives were slim.

Permanent spaciness or
rare irreversible facial twitching.

Where have you been?

What, here?

I've been calling and calling.

What time is it?

It's almost four.

I fell asleep.

I fell asleep in the bathroom.

Hudson, what's going on?

Nothing.

Hudson, tell me what's going on?

Nothing.

I want to know.

The technical term for
it is depersonalization.

But I can't explain to you what
that is because you don't have it.

Can you please try?

It's like when I feel anxious,
which is all the time,

my relationship with
reality is all screwed up.

I look at my hand, and it just doesn't feel...

Like now, I see your lips
moving, and I hear you talking

but it just doesn't feel real to me.

I don't feel real to you?

This all started with the pot.

You think it's the pot?

No, I don't think pot can do that, baby.

Yeah, I don't want to tell you because
I didn't think you'd want to be with me.

Have you seen anybody about this?

I've seen almost everybody about this.

What did they say?

They give me pills, but I don't
think I am taking the right ones,

because they just make me feel worse.

Do you ever feel better?

4:45am

And for the next twenty minutes,
the only time in

this city's day when it
is completely deserted.

I feel that we are the last people on earth.

I wish it was like this all the time.

You can't live like this.

Sometimes I wish I didn't.

I don't think you understand
what he's going through.

I'm afraid for him.

Let me put your mind at ease.

People who talk about killing
themselves very rarely carry it out.

Oh, really?

Because I dated a guy who
talked about it all the time

and then he blew his fucking brains out.

Hudson, you don't mind, I'd like to
speak to Sara alone for a few minutes.

What I'm interested in is why you're here.

Because I care about him.

Why?

Because he does stupid magic tricks.

Because you can't pick
who you fall in love with.

I would never let a girl go to my shrink.

You should've seen her.

She was amazing, she completely defended
me. She really put him in his place.

She knows too much about you now.

So?

Now just a big concern
that she'd use it against you.

For what?

Like a control card.

Whatever she wants, boom, she's got that.

No, Sara would never do that.

OK.
You know what? Ok!

She sounds great.

You want to get some
more done for a few hours?

Yes, I can do that.

After the first round of
individual drug trials failed,

Dr. Richmond decided to bombard
all my neural transmitters at once.

So we combined... everything.

It was like musical drugs and the
music stopped and I couldn't get a chair.

I became numbed at labels.

I just wanted relief.

Good luck with this one, Hudson.

Thanks, Rick.

We have to turn this thing off.

So, one more tournament.

How's your reality system now?

Let's get married.

You're serious?
Yeah.

Hudson, marriage is a
mother-fucker load of responsibility.

I know.

And a lot of work.

I know.

You're not ready to get married.

Yes, I am.

And I want kids, you know, some day.

You think you can do that?

Yes. You don't?

I didn't say that, I just think that maybe

right now is not a good
time to be talking about

marriage when you're
going through this thing.

You can say it, fucked up state of mind,
nobody seems to have a clue what to do with.

But I think you're gonna
work yourself through it.

What if I don't?

You will.

But, what if I don't?

What if this is what I'm gonna
be for the rest of my life?

But I don't think that's the case.

You just need to stop being so...

What?

Negative.

Negative?

Yeah.

Negative. Well, I'm sorry if the rest of the
world was born with perfect brain synapses.

And I'm walking around in la la land, and I
can't tell if this fucking flower is real.

If you are just waiting around
for me to get better, this is it.

This is it.

Tom was right.

In the best of worlds,
all I could bring her was unending grief

and the need for constant reassurance
that I wouldn't lose my mind.

It would only be a matter of time
before she couldn't take it any more.

Self sabotage the best thing in my life?

Of course, I would.

Ready?

What?

You told me you weren't
going to do this again.

I didn't.

Stop it.

Stop what?

I know what you were
trying to do, please don't.

Why? What am I trying to do?

You promised.

Look, this is me.
Alright, it's just me.

You look like a shit.

You wanna end this?

You think you are so irre-fucking-deemable?

Then end it.

Come on, tell me it's over.

But you have to say it.

Fuck!

She didn't do anything.
I did this, I fucked this up, me!

Ok..
just go and apologize.

She deserves a normal person,
not some kleptomaniac freak show.

I asked her to marry me.

What you need now is a
different kind of woman.

Why? So I can just play this shit out again?

Wow, there she is, attractive,

clearly a different woman.

Just go over and talk.

I can't.

Look at me.

I'm your best friend.

Just go and talk, no proposals. Do
not mention the golf channel. Just talk.

Ok, she's on the move, maybe your move now.

Do it!

She's going to the bathroom.

Perfect, go, go.

You're not gonna believe this.

She's a doctor, she specializes
in cognitive behaviorism.

That's incredible.

And she's hot.

Cognitive behaviorism,
the deal was, you can change

the way you felt by altering
your negative thinking.

Will it work? I highly doubted it,

But my god, she was qualified.

Ten years a professor at UCLA,
a Master's in psychology from Stanford.

Another from Cambridge.
Published books on

anxiety, articles in
prestigious medical journals.

Exactly what I needed.

When you say I hate myself for
blowing it with the women of my dreams.

That's an example of magnification.

Or, a better way to express it would be...

at the moment, I am disappointed
that we are no longer together.

But many relationships don't work out.

What can I do to change
my behavior next time?

Are you married?

Now the area we will work on is labeling.

Right, but is there a Mister Doctor Blain?

I don't think that is really
important to your treatment.

Where are you from?

We're not here just to talk about me.

Ok. But it's Texas, right?

Arkansas. OK?

Unlike most therapists, who would never
think of leaving their comfortable offices,

Dr. Blain actually took
her patients into the field.

I can't.

There is absolutely no connection between
saying a word and the health of your father.

Because it will lower your
anxiety and help you get better.

Alright, give me a second.

You can do this, Hudson.

Death.

It worked.
He's ok, he's trimming the hedges.

See?

Has any patient ever asked you out before?

It happens.

Did you ever say yes?

No, never.

How about dinner with me?

I don't think so.

Because we have a professional relationship?

Exactly.

What if I stop seeing you.

I don't think that will be wise.

Right, but what's the
rule on that kind of thing?

You are very sweet, Hudson. But my
only concern is that you get better.

Is that why you blushed back there?

As a way to recovery,
Dr. Blain thought it a good idea

to email me cognitive exercises
so I could practice outside our sessions.

First assignment, monitor
my daily negative thoughts.

Hudson, it's Dr. Blain.
Are you busy?

No, I am just doing
little cognitive homework.

Good, the reason I am
calling is that I found

a very interesting
article on cortisone levels.

I think it may be of some help.

You may want to take a look at it.

Really?

It's like I have it with me now.

Yes, absolutely.

It explains how high cortisone
levels increase the trenolyn

which could have a numb
feeling of depersonalization.

Interesting.

So I'll do some more
reading over the weekend.

Hope I didn't make you drive too far.

No, my shack is only about five minutes away.

Shack? I'm sure it's not a shack.

My god, it is a shack.

Yeah, it is the only place
I feel even close to ok.

Almost like an sanctuary.

I am so sorry this is happening to you.

Thanks.

It's not fair.

Thank you.

And I did blush.

I knew it.

I just think therapeutically it's
important to bring it out in the open.

I do find you very charming,
attractive, and funny.

But things as they are, nothing
can even happen on that level.

I'm sorry.

The door...

Thanks.

Bullshit.

She said it's the first
time she'd sex in seven years.

Bullshit.

It was like having a
wounded animal on top of me.

That's so wrong.

What should I do?

Isn't it obvious?

Try to see her without having to pay.

It is absolutely my fault.
Inexcusable.

I want you to know
that I have spoken to a

colleague to find someone
to take over your sessions.

Who can make me say death?

There is no other way here.
I could lose my license.

I can't see another therapist,
it has to be you.

Hudson, a terrible line has been crossed.

Can't we just forget about
what happened?

You could do that?

Yes.

The first time was exciting,

now having her ride all over me,
I realized that I was letting her use me,

so I could use her so she
worked harder making me better.

I'd become a cognitive whore.

So, is it fresh prune juice and then
death, is that the track record?

Seriously, you still banging that shrink?

I'm afraid to break it off.

She's doing extra research while

she's canceling her appointments
with other patients.

Woo, this is getting bad.

Hudson?

I think we should have some lunch.

What do I do?
Have lunch.

I thought it would be safer to say
what I am about to say in public.

Obviously, something's
happened to my emotions.

My behavior has been... fuck off!

unacceptable.

That can happen.

No, it can't.

Did you witness my tone
with the waiter just then?

I did catch that.

It has to stop, Hudson.
Us, we, this.

I agree.

I was up all night analyzing
my actions, berating myself.

I go to sleep that way every night, so...

Thank you for saying that.
Sure.

I suppose I have spent some many years

listening to other people's feelings that

I've neglected my own.

And it's all coming out now here in the
restaurant in front of all these people?

Which is something I have to
deal with, and I will deal with.

I feel so much better.

God, even my hunger is back.

The tuna looks good.

It's not good, I love you, Hudson.

What?

I love you!

I'm so sorry, I didn't mean
to raise my voice that like.

I though you were dealing with it.

I am, it's just I can't
get you out of my mind.

Sure you can, look at me, I'm a mess,
you don't want that.

I'm flattered that you
think have these feelings.

No, I don't think I have them,

fifteen years of cognitive training, I might just
know a little something about feelings.

God, what is wrong with me.
I'm acting like an insane person.

Will you forgive me?
Yes.

I think we should go.

Sure.

I'll just ask one question.

Can we wait until we get
out of the restaurant?

No, I need to know now.

Do you think under different circumstances
you would feel the same way about me?

I think you need to calm down.

Calm down? I think I know how I am,

and I certainly know how you are.

I love you!

Run!

It just occurred to me I
haven't even met your family.

So how'd it go with the therapist?

Mr. Milbank? This is
the office of Professor

Paula Simon, Mount Sinai
School of Medicine.

We received your enquiry regarding
your depersonalization study.

A spot has become available.
Please contact us at your convenience.

Dr. Paula Simon was
the only doctor in North America

researching depersonalization specifically.

But I was determined to get through
the four day intensive no matter what.

Plus it would be a relief to
finally meet other depersonalized

people as I was beginning
to think I was the only one.

Where are the others?

Others?

Other crazy test patients, like me.

Just you this weekend, sweetheart.

I'll draw your blood for
every hour on the hour for 72 hours.

You're kidding.

That's funny, everyone says that.

You'll see Dr. Simon on Sunday.

I'm the most selfish person in the world.

I blew the best thing that could ever 
happen to me because I was afraid.

I'll see you in an hour.

Count backward from 2004 in groups of 7,

If you make mistake, begin again.

One thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety.

Have any of you guys
ever slept with a patient?

All my attention should have
been at the tests at hand,

but for the first time, I wasn't
thinking about my condition at all.

It was just Sara.

You have depersonalization disorder.

Well, I know that.
How do I get rid of it?

We don't know at this time.

Well, you have to, there's
a great girl involved here.

I've heard.

What about the pot?

Triggered it was all,

it probably would have happened eventually.

But not definitely?

Based on our current research, there was

more than likely
a deficiency there.

So what do I do?

There are medications.

I've taken them all.

And therapies.

I've done them.

Then I suggest you try to accept it.

You suggest I try to accept it?

I do know of an excellent cognitive
behaviorist at UCLA who's been proven helpful.

4.2 cubic feet of space back here.
You won't find that in a Mercedes.

I'll take it.

Very bright and airy.

Beautiful backyard, stunning hardwood
floors. A very pretty yard.

I'll take it.

Tim, Tim, where is she?

She's gone.

What?

She left with some guy.

Where?
Maui.

Which airline?

Delta.

You'll be towed.

Hold on just a second.

Hudson, what are you doing here?

Don't do this. This guy can't
make you swear the way I can.

Go home.

Home to what?

You're the only one I can be myself around.

You are the only one I
can be comfortable with.

I bought you a new house, and a
car, and I'm getting a smaller TV.

Hudson, it's not about a house, or car, or TV.

Ok, how about this?
I love you.

Don't say that.

You can save me,
but you won't even try.

Sara.

Let's go.

Hello.

Can we talk?

Oh, I'm busy.

Our dad just died and you are
doing business on the phone?

It's nothing, it's just my brother, go ahead.

You won't get off the phone.

What the hell is wrong with you?

Hudson, what are you doing?

Nothing.

What happened with you and brother?

Doesn't matter.

That's what he said.

He wants to be downstairs with the others.

Would you stop that?
Would you stop that?

God damn it.

What's wrong with you?

Why have you always been so angry at me?

Are you kidding?

You know they say the first three years
of a child's life is the most essential.

I'm just curious. Were you bouncing
me on my head during that time?

I'd really love to know
how I turned out this way.

Well, it wasn't easy for me either.

Hudson, do you have any idea
what a selfish boy you were?

I was a kid.
Kids are supposed to be selfish.

Ok, fine. I was a terrible mother.
Is that what you want to hear?

Yeah, that's what I want to hear.

I always... loved you children.

But, you and I... were the most alike.

Well that's certainly true.

Maybe I wasn't as nurturing
as I should have been.

That must have been very hard for you to say.

My theory was simple

If smoking marijuana triggered my problem,

smoking even more would reverse it.

Shocking my synapses back to normal.

There's no science behind this,

just a gutsy feeling out of sheer desperation.

Was I scared? Absolutely.

Would it work?
It had to.

You're OK.

God, no.

I needed a quick fix of manic adrenalin

to snap me back into a
resemblance of reality.

Hell, I deserved it.

And I knew just the remedy.

What are you staring at?

Probably best to keep a low key around here.

So, what did you do?

Shoplifted a pair of Air Soles.

Good shoes.

What did you do?

Nothing.

And they don't like that.

Hey, it's gonna be ok.

No, it's not.

I miss Sara.

I don't think I can be a writer anymore.

and I'm completely alone.

Do I look familiar to you?

I've passed you and your dog
outside the grocery store 100 times?

100 times, and I never gave you anything.

I know.

Look, I'll wait here with you.

Maybe Dr. Simon was right.

Maybe I had a predisposition all long.

The pot was the just an
easy excuse to pin it on.

Maybe it was just me.

I was my problem.

Maybe my dad had it right.

Just pull up my socks
and get out my own way.

Hi.
Hello

I'm here to tell you I love you.

Even though I know you're gonna say "ya, so?"
I still love you.

Ok.

See you.

Hudson, I think you are making a big mistake.

We need to have a session to
discuss you ending your sessions.

This is your brain chemistry talking.

There are new medications
coming out all the time.

This should square us up.

This your first time?

I'll wait with you.

Oh my god, you are so late.

Hudson Milbank. God, you are so late.

Sorry I'm late.

No problem.

We understand that you came by in the room

and my partner is very excited about that.

So excited that we worked really
hard for the last a couple of weeks

to come up with something
great for you to hear today.

Well, that's not true.

He's been working really work.

So he's the writer.
He's a really good writer.

The only thing that I'm really good
at is bullshitting all of you guys.

and that's just not enough
for me to be good at anymore.

So I'm gonna go.

Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Tom will take this home for you.

I'll put your name first.

Hi.
Hi.

How are you?

I'm good.
Good.

How are you?

I'm good. I'm better.

I'm not gonna be normal.

I'm still more comfortable at 4:45am
at the corner of Insure and Woodmen.

Look, I don't want to hold you up.

I just want you to know that

even if you lost all your limbs,
we'd still be together forever.

I mean I really hope that doesn't happen

because I think your limbs are... pretty great.

And when I say your name,
it would always sound safe.

I'm not sure about the
perfume, that cologne thing.

But I can try.

You know, I can pick some up.

I will try to make you
smile when you are tired.

I know you think that's really hard to do.

But I think I could do that.

And you'd never have to be
scared to tell me anything.

And if you like this shirt,

I won't take it off for a month.

And I'd be more than willing
to paint your grandmother's toenails

so that your grandfather
won't have to do that anymore.

You don't have to save me, Sara.

But I'm gonna love you
for the rest of my life.

So things will be a lot
better for me if you're around.

Ok.
