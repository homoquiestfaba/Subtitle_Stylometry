I hate to break it to you,

I definitely saw someone standing there.

Anyway, if you're just tuning in,

You look very handsome

Thank you.

Is that why you took the book

You are such a perv.

That's a very intriguing tattoo.

Oh, thank you.
It's really kind of mesmerising.

Whoa, Francis. Restrain.

<i>OMG, stop /00/(ing at my titties!</i>

I have a wife. Alice, if you're listening,
please do not change the locks.

It doesn't stop Heidi, don't worry.


how many people were actually executed

during the Salem witch trials?

Well, approximately 25,

if you include the accused witches
that died in prison.

Come on, 25? Are you serious?

I mean, I have to admit
I'm a bit disappointed with the number.

Were there any quote, unquote,
"real witches" in Salem?

Well, today there's a large
Wiccan population.

They're a positive earth-centred religion.

Yeah, hairy armpits and granola.
I don't dig it.

I shave my armpits.

[Salvador] That's a pity.
Hm.

<i>- You know, classic witches.
[cask/ing]</i>

No, there are no classic witches, actually.

Witchcraft is nothing but
a psychotic belief

brought upon
by a delusional state of mind.

Windy, I can't make an exception.

with our first victim.


This one is a little different from most.
I have no info on where this came from.

All I know is the group is called the Lords.

I assume they're from around here,
so we'll just call them the Lords of Salem.

May I ask you,
where did you get that music from?

According to our receptionist,
it just appeared,

with nothing but a note for me.

It specifically came just to you?

Uh, yeah, very specifically.

I didn't think anyone knew my real name.

Of course I listened.

You were fantastic.
Yeah?

And I recorded you
so you could hear yourself back.

Oh, no, I hate the sound of my voice.

Imagine me.
I have to listen to it every day.

So did you...
Did you record the music that they played?

Oh. Yeah.

You know, I can't believe the noise
that masquerades as music today.

You know?
I know.

You know, I'm hungry.
I'm hungry. Are you?

I'm going to reheat
some of the leftover pasta.

I wanna... listen to that music again.

Something about it really upsets me.

Just...

Especially the name, Lords of Salem.

Where have I heard that?

You really think that Francis guy's cute?

Are you serious?

I mean, come on. Francis?

What kind of name is that?

Don't be jelly.


And you, you get some sleep, would you?

You look exhausted.

Ah, thanks. You make me feel so pretty.

I'm sorry. OK, hold on one second.

There you go.

I'm just gonna go have a quick one

That should do it.
Another dead soldier.

You served your country well, sir.

Hear, hear. Cheers.

So what do you gals do?

I'm a self-help guru.

I help people who are lost,
find themselves again.

Ah. I think I could use some of that.

We all could, baby.

And Megan here...
I read, darling.

Read? I'm not sure I understand.
Like a proofreader?

Megan is a very good palm reader.

Oh.

See, most readings
are like surface observations,

but Megan sees things really deeply,
into the world beyond.

Really? I've never had my palm read before.

I always thought it was kind of a scam.
No offence.

Oh, well, actually, my dear,
I do take offence, great offence.

Plastic Gypsies with crystal balls
and neon signs

have destroyed the value of my gift.

Give her your hand.

The hand and the brain are one.

One quarter of the motor cortex
in the human brain

is devoted to the hand.

Did you know that?
No.

The lines are formed
at a subatomic and cellular level.

These are the lines of your life.

Let me see your right hand.

The right hand is the future.

Ah. ls that the life line?

This is the line of fate.

This is the only line of concern to me.

The length of your life
is inconsequential.

It's what you do with your time
that matters.

Ah. OK, well...
So, tell me, what is my destiny?

It reads your fate, not your destiny.

Is there a difference?

With destiny
you can premeditate the outcome,

but fate, fate leaves you no choice.

It is predetermined
by forces stronger than ourselves.

Oh. I don't like that. I think
I changed my mind. I don't wanna know.

You must make peace
with your subconscious desires.

Really? What desires?

The wicked thoughts
burning inside your head

and exploding
in the juices between your legs.

The darkness within your very soul.

The only reason you exist.

Uh, I think I'll make peace
with those desires later.

I really should be getting upstairs now.

Heidi, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

Megan can be a little adamant,
you know, sometimes about these things.

Yeah, and a little wasted.

I'm really embarrassed.
This is not the evening I had planned.

No, it's fine. Have a good night.

Good night.
Good night.

Well, have another drink.
I think that went rather well.

Why do you have to get so intense
when you do these readings?

It's really annoying.

<i>N0 change, eh, Pete? Still jumpy.</i>

<i>That was a sucker move,
burning down your boss.</i>

<i>- You had him all wrong.

Hi.

Why are you in here?

I don't know.

I was walking by with my dog

and I thought I would just come in
and sit for a minute.

Is that OK? Are you closed?

No.

We never close.

God is always open and ready to listen.

I just needed to sit and think.

Yes.

It is a nice place to just... come and sit.

Yeah, it's nice.

You're a very sad girl.

Yeah.

I think I should get going.

Ow! What the fuck?

You have to understand

that there is a war waging in heaven.

Michael and his angels fought
against the dragon and his serpents,

but God does not spare angels
when they sin

but sends them to hell.

You are a filthy whore of Satan.

Christ can't save you.
Only I can save you.

You must no longer offer
worship and sacrifice

to the goat idols
to whom you prostitute yourself.

You must understand
what the Lord has done for you

and how he has supreme mercy
on your soul!

Miss?

I believe you fell asleep.
It's very peaceful in here.

Now, this... this book reprints
the last remaining five pages

of Jonathan Hawthorne's diary.

The witches, he refers to them

Now, Heidi says
that the music that she received

came to her directly from the Lords.

Yeah. Exactly the same.

Isn't that odd?

No, not really.

and copied the name and the music,

<i>[Francis] We//, I'm not sure, you know.</i>

<i>/ have a few questions
about your book here.</i>

Ah. I thought somebody
besides dear old Mum had a copy.

Let's see.
ls this research for a new book?

Well, maybe, but I'm just trying
to track something right now.

So, what can I do you for?

Well, um, couple of days ago
I was at this radio station,

I was hawking my book,

and I heard this music
by a group called the Lords of Salem.

And I thought that this group and this music
seemed a little odd,

so I did a little research, blah, blah, blah,
and found it in your book.

Let me guess. The diary
of the Reverend Jon Hawthorne, right?

Yeah. I was wondering if by any chance
you have the complete diary or...?

No, no, no, but I did read it in depth.

And do you remember anything of interest?

Well, basically Hawthorne was obsessed

with, in his words, "the master witch"
Margaret Morgan and her coven of six,

whom he dubbed the Lords of Salem.

Why do you think he was obsessed
with this particular coven?

Oh, he thought they were hiding out
in the woods around Salem

making the devil's music

for the purpose of possessing the souls
of the Salem women.

Yeah, well, I gathered that
from the few pages that I read,

that he and his group
eventually killed Morgan and the coven.

Right.
That's where the pages end.

So I was wondering if there's
any other light you could shed on this?

Well, yeah, actually, yeah.

Let's not forget
the curse of Margaret Morgan.

What curse?
Oh, God.

The curse section. That's the best part.

This is where the diary gets so bizarro.

The final sections of the diary just...

Well, I mean,
it's complete rambling nonsense, right?

Let's hear it.
OK.

Well, apparently during the execution,

while the coven and Margaret Morgan
were being roasted alive,

Margaret Morgan put a curse
on the females of Salem.

Something about the forever deaths
of the daughters' daughters

and other crazy stuff like that.

Also she called Hawthorne's bloodline

"the vessel by which the devil's child
would inherit the earth".

Whatever the fuck that meant.

Had to get out of that apartment, man.

One more second in there,
I was really gonna lose it.

<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

Adelheid Elizabeth Hawthorne.

Let's see who you're connected to.

And you are...

Reverend Jonathan Hawthorne.

Fuck me.

Oh, man.

That's right, darling.

You just lay back and rest.

Don't you worry.

We're gonna be right here if you need us.

That's right. Good girl.

[dials number]

<i>-</i> ï¬‚u/vone /17'/gs]
Little baby.

There.

Hello?

Yes, I'd like to speak
to Heidi Hawthome, please.

I'm sorry, darling,
you've got a wrong number.

Please do not call back.

It's so frightfully rude of you
to call at this hour.

Who was that?

Lord knows.

Sonny, get the chair.

[bal1<in9]

Oh, Father, you give us the venom.

Fill us with your essence.

Let it burn through our souls
and our minds.

We trample on the cross.

We spit upon the book of lies.

We desecrate the virgin whore.

We blaspheme his holy spirit
and we rejoice in his suffering.

Guide this child
still in the shackles of the oppressor.

Help her break free
from his tyrant ways.

Entice her to take the precious bite

from whence she shall be delivered.

<i>[man ta/ks on rad/'0]</i>

Hey, where are you going?
Lunch is almost ready.

Oh, I'm gonna go down for a second
to the museum.

I gotta check on something
for the new exhibits.

What are they gonna do
when you retire?

Oh, well, probably sell the place
and start a Starbucks.

I'll be back in an hour.
OK. Love you.

Love you.

[clears throat]

<i>[fiï¬‚ging tone]</i>

<i>[phone rings]</i>

Hello.

Hey, it's me.

<i>H6)'-</i>

Yeah, I was just calling to say what's up?

And make sure everything's all right.

Oh. OK.

So... is everything all right?

Yeah.

<i>Yeah, um...</i>

<i>Hey, /was thinking, maybe we can</i>

hook up before the show...

...and come by,
get some food or something.

Maybe talk about things.

No, I'm all right.

I'm not feeling very hungry any more.

<i>OK N0, no, /understand that.</i>

<i>/ could swing by around 10:30.</i>

<i>We can head to the g/g together.</i>

No.

I'll get there on my own. Bye.

Wait, wait, wait.
Don't... don't... don't hang up.

<i>/ know in the past / 0'/'dn't understand</i>

<i>and /'m not saying / understand now,
but /'m here.</i>

Whenever you need me.

I know.

I'll always know.

Bye.

<i>[Lacy] You love him, don't you?</i>

Excuse me.
Does Heidi Hawthorne live here?

Do you perhaps mean
Adelheid Elizabeth Hawthorne?

Yes, as a matter of fact I do, yes.

You look familiar.

Oh, well, I woll<
at the wax museum part time.

You probably saw me
walking back and forth on my lunch hour.

Oh, yes. The wonderful wax museum.

We have to teach our impressionable
children about Salem's glorious past.

Yes. Well, I'm Francis Matthais.
Uh-huh.

Now, are you a friend or foe?

Oh, well, I don't know
if I'm exactly a friend,

but I'm definitely not a foe.

I'm a mild acquaintance.

And you are?
Lacy.

I look after Heidi.

<i>[Francis] Oh, we//, couldl see her?</i>

<i>[Lacy] / don'! see why not.</i>

<i>Why don 't you come on in ?</i>

<i>He/'0'/is just stepped out for a moment,
but we can wait in my apartment'.</i>

<i>- She won'! be long.
Oh, we//, /can come back later.</i>

<i>[Lacy] N0. N0, no, no.</i>

Come on in. Come and have some tea.

All right.

So...

Are you a married man, Francis?

Yes, as a matter of fact.
26 years in November.

26 happy years?

For the most part, yeah.

Local girl?

No, she's not a Salem lifer like me.

She's a Venezuelan girl, actually.

Any children?

No. We never got around to children.

Well, that's understandable.

Children are a bit of a waste.
Most are a total loss.

So few have anything of substance
to really offer us.

But... on the rare occasion
a special child appears.

Mm.

Well, I never really
thought about it that way.

I just didn't like the idea
of changing diapers.

Is Megan spinning her little philosophies
on the value of breeding again?

Don't mind her.
She lives in her own little bubble.

So, Mr Matthais, what was so important

that you had to rush over here
and see our dear little Heidi?

Well, it wasn't that important.

It was just a record that she played
on her show the other night.

Oh, really? And what record
would that be, Mr Matthais?

Some record by a group called the Lords.

You know, don't take this the wrong way,

but aren't you a little old
to like that shit?

Yeah. I was a guest on the show, actually,
if you can imagine that.

Sonny, darling,
would you mind getting me the sugar?

So, anyway, ljust had some information

I thought she might find interesting.

Oh, I'm sure she would.

Mr Matthais, you strike me as a man
who would normally mind his own business.

I do, do I?

WW are you laughing?

I'm not laughing.

Is something suddenly funny?

Uh...

You know, I think I'll come back...
You know what I think?

I don't have a clue.

I think you've come here to get inside
my dear little Heidi's head.

Get inside her head and fuck her brain.

Have you come here to stick
your nosey cock inside her head

and fuck her brain, Mr Matthais?

I think I should go.
Oh, no!

Good.
That felt good.

Well, if it isn't my favourite fairy story.

<i>The End of the American W/fc/1.</i>

I'll bet there are all sorts of juicy stories
of cunty witches

and the heroic deeds
of the fucking mighty Jon Hawthome.

It seems you'd love to tell
our little Heidi

all about these spooky little tales
of judgement day.

Sonny.

No. No!

[Francis screams]

[P Vic Damone: Sugar]

<i>I / call my baby my sugar</i>

<i>I / never maybe...</i>

What a waste of a good man.

Yes. Such a pity.

And he was never going to be able
to stop anything.

Hey-ho.

Anyone care for a fresh pot of tea?

Lovely, darling.

[distorted, echoing barking]

Hello, Whitey.

Hi.

Going somewhere, are we?

Yeah, I was gonna go up and get Heidi.

You look nervous. Are you nervous?

No. Excuse me.

Why don't you sit here with us?
We need to talk.

No, really, I should get going.

We've got this thing
we're gonna do tonight.

Well, don't let us stand in your way.

Yeah, sure.

Take care of Heidi.
She means the world to us, you know.




What are you doing here?
I told you not to come here.

[sob$]


You can tell Whitey to wait outside.

Wait for me outside.


Please just wait for me outside. Just go.

Come on, Whitey.

Come on.

Come with me.

Ah, man.

You look like death.
Chill, man.

We'll talk about this later, OK?

Later?
Yeah, later.

Don't tell me to chill.
I wanna know what the hell's going on.

Just listen.
Let's just get through this tonight.

Tomorrow we can start dealing with this.

Bye.

<i>[P Mozart: Requiem K 626]</i>

Lord, hear us.

We are ready to bring
your precious child to this world.

you preach punishment and shame

to those who would
emancipate themselves

and repudiate the slavery of the Church.

Satan, come to us. We are ready.

Satan, come to us. We are ready.

Satan, come to us. We are ready.


Welcome...

...whores of Salem.

I can taste the foul stench
of your ancestors rotting

in the folds of filth between your legs.


The blood of your deaths

shall be the eternity

Of OUT resurrection.

Heidi.

The one.

We've been waiting for you, Heidi.

We've always...

...been waiting.
