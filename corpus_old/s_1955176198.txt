â™ª <i>Oh, ahh</i>

â™ª <i>Dadah, a-dah, dahh,</i>

â™ª <i>da-dah, didi</i>

<i>It is written</i>

<i>among those limitless
constellations</i>

<i>of the celestial heavens</i>

<i>and in the depths
of the emerald seas</i>

<i>and upon every grain of sand</i>

<i>in the vast deserts</i>

<i>that the world which we see</i>

<i>is an outward and visible dream</i>

<i>of an inward and
invisible reality.</i>

<i>Once upon a time</i>

<i>there was a golden city.</i>â˜»

<i>In the center of the golden city,</i>

<i>atop the tallest minaret</i>

<i>were three gold balls.</i>

<i>The ancients had profecied</i>

<i>that if the three golden balls</i>

<i>were ever taken away</i>

<i>harmony would yield to discord</i>

<i>and the city would
fall to destruction</i>

<i>and death.</i>

<i>But, the mystics had also foretold</i>

<i>that the city might be saved</i>

<i>by the simplest soul,</i>

<i>with the smallest and
simplest of things.</i>

<i>In the city</i>

<i>there dwelt a lowly shoemaker</i>

<i>who was known</i>

<i>as Tack the cobbler.</i>

<i>Also, in the city</i>

<i>existed</i>

<i>a thief</i>

<i>who shall be nameless.</i>

â™ª <i>Have no fear!
Have no fear!</i>

â™ª <i>Zigzag, the Grand Visir, is here!</i>

â™ª <i>Have no fear!
Have no fear!</i>

â™ª <i>Zigzag, the Grand Visir, is here!</i>

â™ª <i>Have no fear!
Have no fear!</i>

â™ª <i>Zigzag, the Grand Visir, is here!</i>

Haii ! Woaoww !

Seize him! Take him!

Seize him! Take him!

Seize him!

Take him into the palace!

Wake! Wake, father!

Er... er... oh!

Something's happening!

Oh, Great King Nod,

have no fear,

Zigzag, your Grand Visir, is here!

Oh,

it's you, Zigzag.

And now, o Greatest of the Great,

to rest you from affairs of state

I've searched the world
and brought you thence,

at no little effort and great expense,

a plaything from far south of Gaza

A bountiful maiden from...

Mombasa!

Mombasa?

Oh, father!

Mombasa

Who is this?

O, Greatest King of all the Earth,

This low-born cobbler of no worth

Attacked me in the square, today

Shall we take his head away?

What?

No...

Yes, Zigzag, if really think so.

But what has he done?

Attacked me!

Really?

Yes.

You great fool!

What? What? What?

At the moment, daddy,

I need a cobbler.

Er, er, yes, ... of course.

of course, o Rose of the Land,

your slightest whim is my command.

Er, cobbler,

go with Princess Yumyum.

Open for the Royal Polo Ponies!

â™ª <i>Open for the Royal Polo Ponies.</i>

â™ª <i>Open for the Royal Polo Ponies.</i>

â™ª <i>Open for the Royal Polo Ponies.</i>

The nice young mam is fixin'

your slippers m'dear.

Yes, nanny.

Cobbler, what's your name?

Tack?! Is that your name?

Tack!

Your bath is ready my dear.

Where is my back scratcher?

Oh well, I have another.

La la... huh?

What's happening to me?

Oh! Maybe the pipes are backed up.

Maybe something died.

Aha! You've finished Yumyum's shoe.

You've done it very well!

And now, she has no need of you,

we'll put you in a cell.

Oh, Imperial Majesty!

Yes, yes, Zigzag?

From farthest Cathay,

at my bidding, were sent

the best polo ponies of the Orient

Very nice.

To please King Nod,

beloved by all

Commence the game!

In short, PLAY BALL !

Father, father!

Oh?

Do you know where
my cobbler has gone to?

What? No.

Isn't he with you?

Fixing your shoe?

He seems to have vanished

Oh! How wonderful, swing o King!

Yes... Oh, yes...

O, wisest of rulers!

Happy is the kingdom

in this milk and honeyed land

Happy are the sujects

who live beneath your hand

We rejoice at all around us,

as this beauteous evening falls,

Safe beneath the sure protection

of the ancient golden balls

One-eyes! One-eyes!

One-eyes win again!

One-eyes! One-eyes!

I shall gnaw the golden city

to the bone

and I shall spit it out!

No one is left alive to warn them!

One-eyes! One-eyes!

The day of death

has come to the golden land!

And I shall conquer the golden city!

I shall trample and break them

and not show pity!

No man escapes the mighty One-eye!

Sleep... sleep... sleep.

They sleep, they sleep..

They're all asleep

But I am quite awake!

Eh, Fido?

I rise above the human heap.

The world is mine to take.

Eh, Fido?

Men are fools who walk in dreams.

They sleep their lives away.

But I, Zigzag, will reign supreme,

for they are easy prey.

Eh, Fido?

For I intend to take as wife...

the daughter of the King.

And with her, my royal bride,

I'll rule in public sight,

with Princess Yumyum at my side.

The crown is mine by right!

Eh, Fido?

Poor Fido! How could I forget?

I fear you haven't eaten yet.

For you, dear bird, a special treat

For breakfast

you'll have cobbler to eat.

Thief!

Stop, thief!

Youll have the head for starters

then the neck and then the heart.

Such a tasty little man, eh...

My flying garbage can?

There's your breakfast, Fido dear

You can eat it up, right here.

Zigzag! Zigzag!

Get me Zigza!... Now!

â™ª <i>Zigzag, Zigzag, Zigzag, Zigzag!</i>

â™ª <i>The king wants ...</i> - Aoww!

Fido, affairs of State.

I fear your breakfast
will have to wait.

Coming, Your Majesty,  coming!

Oh Great King Nod, have no fear!

Zigzag, your Grand Vizir is here

Death and destruction, Zigzag

My kingdom will come to
destruction and death.

Calm, Serene Highness.

You must catch your breath

What dawn of disaster?

Why speak you of death?

A nightmare... no, a vision!

A vision of invasion!

An entire race of one eyed men!

And death... death, everywhere.

Excellent Majesty, Ruler Supreme!

I can safely assure you

a dream's just a dream.

I saw it, I tell you!

Calm down, Your Highness.

Invaders?! One-eyed?!

But, this is against what has been profecied.

For, has it not been written,
we are safe from any threat.

as long as those three golden
balls are on the minaret?

Aah! What if the balls are taken away?

A way has never been found

to take them away.

What freak of nature

could ever get up to the
top of that minaret?

*Sangre! Fire!

-Catastrofe! Calamity!
-Oh my dear!

Such things could never happen here

Such things have never occurred here.

Well, they haven't happened yet!

Oh, can't you see?

The golden balls are
safe atop the minaret!

I - I just...

have this funny feeling.

It's not time to get up, too early to arise,

too early to open the King's sleepy eyes.

Wait, wait father!

Something's happening!

Is this the opportunity ringing?

I thunk there are some balls,
you should be bringing.

Get those balls. Keep out of sight.

Bring them to me late tonight.

Who won?

Won?

One... eye...

Won?!... I?

is ... coming!

One I?!

Aye?!

One eye!!!

Alla barad!

The balls are gone!

My kingdom will come to
destruction and death!

My loyal generals!

My brave soldiers!

The three golden
balls have gone!

Our city faces invasion!

The mighty One Eye is coming

Take up your positions!

With my blessing.

<i>Long live King Nod!</i>

<i>Long live King Nod!</i>

Nanny, where could my cobbler be?

Try the prision.

What? Oh, no!

What goes on in this palace?

<i>Ah, lovely balls!</i>

<i>Use the door you idiot!</i>

Oh, I see who jailed you.

Get away, bird of evil!

Get back to your master's tower!

Gone!...

Thief! Thief!

Thief! Thief!

Gentlemen, gentlemen! What a delight!

We'll let this be our little secret...

All right?

I'll rule the land, after one little thing.

Now that I have the balls,

I will go see the king

Have no fear, Zigzag, your Gran...

You're here, Zigzag, but where are the balls?

Magicked away, my Lord.

Magicked away?!

Oh, no...

Oh, you mustn't look so tragic.

I am not unschooled in magic.

You mean... you?!

Alakazam!

Observe!

Look at that!

There's something...

You see, I can restore you the gold balls,
though they be lost.

I'll give you anything, Zigzag
Just do it!

As my peril will be dire,

you must grant my heart's desire.

Which is?

I require, Sire,

your daughter Yumyum, to wed.

You... want my daughter?!

Never!

Never?

Never, ever!

Get out! Ouuuut!

Well, I just thought I'd ask.

We'll see who wins at the end of the day!

We'll see who ends up grieving!

I'll go to One Eye, right away.

I'm taking my balls and leaving!

Magic... The witch!

Fetch me my daughter!

â™ª <i>The................................................</i>

â™ª <i>The... beautiful..............................</i>

â™ª <i>The... beautiful...Princess...............</i>

â™ª <i>The... beautiful... Princess... Yumyum.</i>

How can I be of help, daddy?

You must get away.

I've got to stay and fight.

Listen carefully.

The golden balls have
been magicked away!

Magicked?

But we may have one chance.

There is a mad and holy old witch

who dwells at the top
of the desert mountain.

You must go and seek out this witch.

Perhaps she can tell us how
the city can be saved.

Had I a son, I would send him
on this perilous journey.

Father, I can handle it.

At the foot of the desert mountain...

is a golden idol, with a priceless
ruby set in its forehead.

When the desert sun is directly overhead,

the reflection of the ruby
falls upon a hidden door

to a path up the mountain.

Yes father.

You must cross the great desret. Go now!

Father, we need a guide!

Yes, but who?

I know, who.

How did you get free?

Him... the cobbler?!

He's resourceful.

Can you trust him?

Yes.

Oh, my darling, take care!

Times has changed, Hoolie.

Arr!

Arr, indeed they have, chieftain.

â™ª <i>Oh, ahh</i>

'Twas different.
It was then.

â™ª <i>Dadah, a-dah, dahh,</i>

â™ª <i>da-dah, didi</i>

...oh in them different times.

â™ª <i>La-dah, dah, dahh,</i>

Things is not what they used to be, you know.

No.

Oh, no. No, they're not.

It used to be different.

A caravan is coming!

Here comes a caravan!

Ah, will ya stop going on?

Clear off!

Chieftain!

A caravan!

Caravan?

A caravan!

We're rich!

Jewels!
Food!

Drink!

What is it, that we do now?

Aye, he's right, what do we do?

May I remind you, gentlemen,

that when in doubt, consult...

"The Brigand's Handbook".

Aaahh!

The book!
The book...

of words.

Of words!

What does the book say?

Ca. . ra. . van... Caravan!

Chaaarge!

Shut up ya fools!

Keep your heads down

Haaalt!

Who are you?

Well... er...I am Roofless The chieftain!

Abd this sd my band of bigands

We are the scourge of the counrysidel

I am the Princess Yumyum -

daughter of your King

And that's my nurse, you're sitting on.

Eh,
What? Rise a bit

You're a disgrace to your profession!

Just look at you!

Look at the state of your shoes!

Well things have not been too good lately.
Like, no, I mean...

In fact this is the first caravan we've
seen for thirty years, innit boys?

That's true.
-Well. we is doing our best

Your country is in great danger.

I hereby declare you my Royal Guard.

Umm, Royal Guardl, boys!

You will accompany us
on our perilous journey

to save our golden land!

The camp of the One Eyes,
how very nice!

Perhaps they'll be willing
to pay my price.

I'll have these barbarians
kissing my feet.

And maybe we'll find you
something to eat.

Eh, Fido?

Gentlemen, gentlemen, what a delight!

To meet you all here
on such a fine night.

Throne!

Fido!

Who dares enter the camp
of The Mighty One Eye?

Oh, Mighty One Eye!

I... I... I am Zigzag the Greato
of the golden land.

And ?...

I am a magician -- sorcerer too.

And I'm in a position,
I think, to serve you.

Sorcerer?

I conjure demons,

charm beasts,

and birds of prey too.

Fido!

As you will see, that's not all I can do.

Haha!

I have power over people,

though they may appear complex

for me, they fall like playing cards.

And I control the deck!

But all this is nothing,

for, now, in my hand

is the very key to the golden land!

For, no man can take it, no matter how great

unless he possesses...

these three balls of fate!

You say you can charm beasts?

Throw him to the alligators!

What's that?

Now, what is it?...

Lo, and behold!

My friends...

it grieves me to see
you fed on persons like me,

with no meat.

Just help me a little and I won't foget

to feed you each day a surprise

that is plump, portly, paunchy and fat!

Faaaat!

Magic! 'Tis magic!

Princess, perhaps me and my men
ought to be staying here.

Yes, Roofless, you stay here.

Guard the exit, we're going up.

'Tis magic from another world.

My friends.

My friends!

Careful, Tack!

Oh, Tack, I knew you'd get us here!

Giant bird! Giant bird!

Oh, mad and holy old witch,

I am Princess Yumyum
of the Golden City.

Meh!

Our Golden City is going to be under attack.

My father says you can tell us
how we can save our city.

Hmm!

We'll pay.

Ok. Everyone, here,
who can save your city?

Eenie, meenie, miney, mo!

Tack?!

Can Tack save our city?

Aaah, aaa!

Hmph! Ga!

Mnyk mnyo, mm!

Hmmm!

Aaha!

He's got a big heart.

Tack, how do you feel about it?

Money in front!

Aaah! For you, I will make special price!

And take a special trip!

Mystic mood!

Show me the way,

show me how this curse to lay

Match... match!

Attack...

Hah!

A tack.

See?

But it's what you do
with what you got!

Go home!

Noooowww!...

Faster! Faster! Faster!

Take me to your master!

One mistake will suffice.

Don't treat me lightly twice.

Take me to your master!

Gentlemen, we must return at once!

Your Majesty, if there's one thing myself and my men are good at...

Good at ?

We're good at making our getaway!

We're good at running.

Away!
Away!

Banzai!

Get set, GO!!

Now, shall we slaughter?

Except for the Princess,
that, we agreed.

She is the price for my traitorous deed.

Their soldiers will cower behind these walls

when they see that we have
the three golden balls.

Tomorrow... I strike!

And you shall ride at the front...

sorcerer.

Take the right flank!  You, the left flank!

Turret gate!

Doorman, you take the
women and children!

Ready the physicians!

Faster, faster, you fools!

Tack! Taaack!

Taaack!

The greatest wizard has to know,
exactly when it's time to GO !!

My friends, my friends, are you still here?

I haven't fed you yet, I fear.

Oh, my bottom! Oh, my top!

Greedies, don't you ever stop?!

You too, Fido? Man's best friend?!

For Zigzag, then, it is the end.

Oh, my God!

Oh, Tack, my cobbler!

My daughter! My wonderful daughter!

The prophecy is fulfilled!

The city owes you a great debt of gratitude

Oh, cobbler, how can we ever repay you?

Father...

Oh!

I love you.

I love you.
