( Hitler giving speech
in the distance )

( crowd cheering )

( speaking German )

( crowd cheers )

Before us
lies Germany,

within us
marches Germany,

and after us

comes Germany!

Hitler: At the extreme,
one becomes a symbol.

Every man
who desires adulation

will recognize in me
the pure manifestation

of that dark part
of himself.

l am the perfect reflection

of every man
with the lust to dominate,

who has some bias
or prejudice--

some unsatisfied craving.

Some will condemn me morally,
but they cannot escape

the power of my image.

Their self-righteousness
will dissolve,

as their hearts beat

with the rhythm of my essence.

Even those poor souls

who hate me
will privately envy me,

because l've fulfilled
my dreams,

whilst others repress

their true desires.

Thus, have l guaranteed
my immortality.

The essential Hitler
has a hold

over every human heart.

Does that sound
clichéd?

Anyway, let's end this
on a poetic note.

Will to power.

Will to form.

Will to beauty.

Look at the men, Goebbels.

Geometry.
Classic lines.

Nothing is more
important to me

than the preservation
of these images.

Power. Order.

Solemnity.

You know what l like most?

Your decision to break
the formation

here and here.

Not only does it
serve the composition,

but it gives the impression
of the Cross.

Hmmm. The Messiah theme.

Here it is.

Do you think l should have
walked down the aisle alone?

That's an interesting question.

My instinct was that
a loner would be viewed

as less trustworthy.
Goebbels: Hmmm.

Hitler: Better to be surrounded
by faithful lieutenants.

Goebbels:
Yes... l think so.

Those men, Goebbels,

what are they thinking?

A person wants to be a part
of something beyond his...

small self.

To escape.

To be lost

in a historic moment.

l wonder if their feet hurt.

You organized the people
on a whole new basis.

By invoking
Aryan superiority,

you enabled us
to transcend regional

and religious rivalries,

even trivial issues
of gender,

age, class distinctions.

l created a great
circulation of energy,

self-replicating,
self-reaffirming.

My God!

ln the First World War,

the Jews and the Bolsheviks

stabbed Germany
in the back.

Even as German blood spilled
in our just and noble cause,

the enemy within sought
to destroy us by treachery!

The bad within
must be extracted.

We must protect Germany!

l must save the motherland

from this defilement!

( coughing )

You could never understand
a man of will.

The problem with you Jews

is you think
you know so much--

the inside of a man,

this nonsense about

the ''id'' and ''superego.''

A man is the sum total
of his acts.

Success justifies all.

So, what can we learn
from your actions?

That a man is his own creation,
his own artwork.

To use only reason
is to close the door

to the power of an idea

like blood and soil.

Freud:
What of your inner world?

l know myself completely,
l know my personal myths.

That is enough.

With the answers
to 1,000 questions,

you and your kind
could not begin

to understand me.

Only a poet

could touch the edge

of the Führer mystery.

Where was l?

Ah, l remember now.

One power alone
makes a great leader--

imagination, divine vision.

l took those words
from someone.

l can't remember whom.

lt's good to be
writing again.

Film is the magician's mirror...

the first art form
which allows the artist

to project his dreams
and fantasies,

into the inner life
of the viewer,

to reshape
and capture his soul,

to create
a perfect reality

indelibly inscribed
on the minds of billions.

My works of destruction
and grandeur will live on.

l am the artist.

l am the artwork.

l was Homer.

l was Ulysses.

l was the Odyssey.

l enlisted powerful men,
courageous men,

to the task of fulfilling

my artistic destiny.

Your fairness cleanses me.

To make love to you,

is to make love
to all of Germany.

Eva: My Führer.

( Hitler whispers )
My angel.

Eva: Wolfie?

Eva: What?

l represented
the rejection of the modern.

What is it, Adolf?

A return to the world
of Homer,

in which war isn't

about massive destruction,

but remains
first and foremost...

an instrument--
( coughs )

to enhance
a hero's personal glory.

Hitler:
Modern art

is the enfevered fantasies

of an incurably sick people.

The fact that nine-tenths

of artistic rubbish--

literary filth,

theatrical idiocy--

can be traced to the account
of one people,

of all the country's
inhabitants

can simply not be
talked away.

lt is the plain truth.

The Jewish-Christian creed,
with its effeminate ethics

undermines our vitality.

Morality is a decay,

a blemish like
the Hebrew circumcision.

The German people must
learn to distrust reason,

the dirty and degrading
idea of conscience.

What number
was the last footnote?

28, mein Führer.

Footnote 29.

The Führer
wrote these words

for the first draft
of Mein Kampf,

the morning of May 2, 1924,

in Landsberg Prison.

ln other countries,

why do they keep
the German title Mein Kampf,

instead of translating it to...

My struggle?

Hitler: The sun...

is uncontrollable...

unforgiving.

With the sun,

you can't...

shape and sculpt reality.

l hate the sun.

There is magic
in enormity, my doctor--

overwhelming,
like a dominant father.

Yes, but...

the art is in disguising

the technique.

Brutality must be wrapped

in velvet.

That is what
distinguishes us

from say...

a thug like Stalin.

Hitler: Wagner made
the exorbitant demand

that the stage become
an hypnotic instrument

under the power
of the artist.

l impose the same demand
on Germany.

History is an error
to be rewritten

be the visionary
playwright.

While Wagner brought
the German myths

to the operatic stage,

l brought them
to the world.

l am the superman,

the Teutonic knight

on the quest
for the Holy Grail.

Compared to you,

Wagner was a minimalist.

Let's enter one more
into the record.

This is from April, 1935.

A woman from Berlin.

''My fervently adored Führer,

you have a birthday,

and we know
only two ardent wishes:

that everything
in our fatherland be,

now and in the future,
just as you want it to be,

and may God provide
that you be preserved

for us forever.

Your loyal, E.E.''

Just a minute.

l thought you said
our count was 5,700,000.

They're using
the 6-million figure.

( Hitler mumbles )
Typical.

A clever exaggeration.

Well, all right, Goering,
let's use those figures.

Suits us. History likes
round numbers.

Now, the war total

was 55 million.

Out of that,

the camps and death squads
were responsible for only

11 or 12 million.

Goering: 12.

Could we say
that half of those

were non-Jews?

were Christians,
atheists and pagans.

Hitler:
Awkward language.

What term covers Gypsies,
Polish intelligentsia,

Russian upper strata,
prisoners of war,

French and Yugoslavian partisans,
political opponents?

Well, should we say
''gentiles''?

But if 12 million
were liquidated

and only six million
were Jews--

or is it 5.7?

Why can't l get
accurate figures?!

Where's Himmler?!

l would stand behind
this wording.

Almost half the dead

were from the Christian world.

( Hitler mutters )
Yes.

And yet the Jews
take their removal

so personally.

( Goering laughs )

What strikes me is

that little notice
is taken of the fact

that the first
biological cleansing

eliminated
German nationals--

the disabled, the retarded,

the mentally ill--
And the bedwetters.

The useless eaters.

Commenced the 1st
of September, 1939.

Actually, mein Führer,

it was October 1st.

You backdated the decree

one month to correspond
with the first day of the war.

Tidier.
Yes.

War for living space.
Yes.

War for race purification.
Yes.

All began on the same day.
Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

From Latvia to Lithuania,

from Estonia to Slovakia,

from Russia,

from Poland to the Ukraine--

wherever we found them.

250,000

blonde-haired,

blue-eyed nuggets...

harvested
for the Third Reich.

Nordic nuggets,

to lighten up
the dark Bavarians.

They took children
from their parents?

They were misplaced Germans.
We brought them home.

( rhythmical resounding sound )

Eva: Look at you,
posing for my camera,

as if you didn't know
l was there.

Hitler: Do l look more
mysterious in a hat?

( Eva giggles )

Eva: Why did you never wear
an official army

SA or SS uniform?
Better to remain undefined.

Suggestive indefiniteness.

There are so few public
pictures of you smiling.

There were none
before l was chancellor--

nor any with children

or small animals.

The holiday in lceland
was a joyous time

for my sisters and me.
You should have come with us.

You were always inspired
by the Viking sagas.

The only flaw in the trip

was a delay before
we departed from Hamburg.

l had no time
for holiday trips.

The police came just before
we were to leave.

A family was removed
from the ship.

l'll never forget the cries--
Quiet!

Never mention that again!

( softly )
Look.

Did you like me better
when l was blonde,

with baby-fat?

Or later when l was
brunette and thin?

l liked you when you were
blonde and thin.

Hitler: ...fulfillment
of a mysterious longing.

My need to control

will fill others' need
to be controlled.

That was my euphoric
discovery:

the union of my urges

with the German
people's desires!

lf you unite
a powerful people,

whose first duty

is obedience,

you can do

anything.

( whispers )
God...

l love to order.

Every woman a potential
source of solace,

warmth, love.

Every man, a rival.

Hitler:
''l am the German spirit.

Consider the incomparable
magic of my works...''

Did you write that?

''...the incomparable

magic of my works.''

lt's Wagner.

''Man is a beast of prey,

developing through
constant progress.

The beast conquers,
founds great realms

by the subjugation

of other subjugators,

forms states

and organizes civilizations,

in order to enjoy his booty

in peace.

Attack and defense,

suffering and struggle,

domination and servitude.''

Are those Wagner's words?

We were both illusionists
and showmen.

l made my life so different,

so vibrant, so extreme.

That was how...

l accumulated power.

l wrapped

iron and blood

in a cloud

of mystic communion

with the German Volk.

Whoever wants
to understand Hitler,

must first learn Wagner.

Write this!

Fire.

Fire fascinates Hitler.

lt consumes without
accepting or rejecting.

Hitler: Read the last sentence
back to me.

Typist: ''We made the sound
so overwhelming,

the attitude so certain,

the level of force so high,

the spectacle so grand,

that no one could see
anything at the center

but the symbolism.''

Yes. Good.

The symbolism
at the center.

Like the sun,

nobody could look at me
without the pain

and punishment of blindness.

Number two!
The receptivity of the masses

is unlimited,
yet their understanding

is feeble.
They quickly forget.

Three!

The masses tell each other
small lies.

lt could never come
into their heads

to create colossal tales.

Thus, bold myths work best.

Four.

Effective propaganda must be
confined to stereotypes.

Always focus people's
attention on a single foe.

To have multiple enemies
confuses people.

My genius was the combining

of two enemies--

Jews and Marxism--

into one.

Jewish Marxism...

the synthesis

that was the key
to my success.

Weave this in:

Crude simplifications
endlessly repeated

will influence the supple.

Goebbel's realm.

For the non-supple,

the stubborn...

terror is necessary--

Himmler's responsibility.

When l was a small boy
in Linz,

l frequently played alone.

l would walk
to the top of the hill

overlooking the city.

ln dark solitude,

l imagined l had absolute
command of those heights

and all the lands below.

Only the trees on the hillside
heard my cry.

Heil Hitler!

( under his breath )
Heil Hitler.

Those private moments
stayed with me

through the darkest days.

The tragedy of every
charismatic leader

is to be imprisoned
by his fate.

His triumphs are finite,

his needs...

infinite.

( stringed instruments plays )

( choir sings )

( choir fades )
( overlapping whispers )

This was to have
been built... for you.

Hitler: What will they
think of us?

History...

those who study our lives?

Will we be judged
by what we say,

by our deeds,

by the monuments and images
we leave behind...

or...

by something else?

Something...

we can't control?

Eva: They adored you.

They were stupefied
by the Führer cult...

so hungry for me,

as if l could fill
their emptiness.

By feeding them hope,
you stimulated their craving.

Yes...

the desire to be
the desired object.

Eva: For women,
you were the ideal lover,

the perfect father.
Hitler: Fleeting.

The thrill quickly loses
its impact.

You were the one thing...

that brought me peace.

l told you to destroy
that footage!

Hitler: When l was homeless
during a cold Vienna winter,

a Jewish art dealer
gave me an overcoat.

l even had a Jewish friend
at the men's shelter

with whom l spent
many pleasant afternoons.

Maybe, there would have been
an advantage

in not exterminating
the Jews.

Well, for a long time,
we considered a territorial solution.

We would put them
in reservations

or ship them to...

Madagascar.

ln fact, we encouraged
mass emigration.

Eichmann's assignment
during the '30s

was to find places
to move them to.

But...

few countries would take
more than a handful.

Someone even proposed...

a mass sterilization plan.

An ugly necessity.

ln every society,
there are pent up hatreds.

For example,
in the United States

it's against the blacks;
in Russia, the successful.

A politician must mobilize

these hatreds.

Reason must be
trained to think

in historical dimensions.

Get out!
Get out!

You'll get nothing from me!
No mercy!

Tell them Hitler has ice
in his veins!

lce!

l'm the greatest actor
in Europe.

l am...

the greatest actor
in Europe.

Hitler: What a thrill
to play the Führer--

for 12 years,

the supreme Father figure.

On to surpass
even Lord Grimm.

They made me
''Man of the Year.''

They made you what?

Time Magazine,
they made me ''Man of the Year.''

l was on the cover
for six issues.

l conquered Poland, Norway,
Denmark, France.

Americans love a winner.

Of course, it doesn't
mean a thing.

They made Roosevelt

''Man of the Year''
three times!

And he was a cripple.

Goebbels:
Look at Himmler.

Hitler: You're not exactly
Clark Gable yourself,

my little doctor.

Himmler looks like a weasel.

Goebbels:
Making our enemies look bad

was often easier
than making us--

Hitler:
The perfect Aryan Superman.

A weak stomach
in the presence of violence.

Woo!
Heinrich Himmler.

Didn't anyone notice?

He was ruthless,

but not careless.

And Hitler-loyal.

Who better to run the SS?

Art must be plausible.

lf you wrote a script
about Aryan superiority

and cast Himmler,
people would laugh,

walk out of the theatre.

On the political stage,

you can do anything.

Let's put up another reel.

lmages to blur facts.

Hitler: ln World War l,
l was a messenger.

l never killed anyone.

l am a vegetarian.

l never eat dead animals.

l loathe big game hunters--

a gruesome bloodbath.

l would not allow smoking
in my presence.

We discouraged
tobacco consumption.

l insisted on the humane
treatment of pets

and farm animals.

l even issued a decree
regulating the cooking

of lobsters to minimize
their suffering.

l reduced chemicals
in fruits and vegetables.

The SS planted
organic gardens.

l am not a brutal man
by nature.

l am not a brutal man
by nature.

l am not a brutal man
by nature.

l'm not a brutal man
by nature.

l am not a brutal man.

Hitler: Only a charismatic
leader could heal the wounds

of the great war inflicted on us
by the November criminals.

Hitler's charisma was
as much created

by the German masses
as it was

imposed upon them.
ln peacetime,

stability and routine
undermine charisma.

ln wartime,
the great threat

is defeat.

lt was the failure
of the will

of the German people

that fatally undermined
my charisma!

You take...

an ordinary man,

dress him in a uniform...

and that man...

will commit acts

he never before...

imagined.

You can turn
a runny-nosed, bedwetter...

into a ruthless warrior.

lf l'd stopped with
the conquest of France,

l would have gone
down in history

as the greatest conqueror
since Alexander The Great.

No! No, no.

''Greatest military
genius in history.''

Wait--
what do you think?

Well, no...

Ah... here it is.

''Greatest empire
since Caesar.''

That-- that's it.

Let's make it...

lf l had stopped
with the conquest of France,

l would have built

the greatest sustained empire

since Caesar Augustus.

What l hated most
about the war

was fighting the English.

The fair Brits...

our racial brothers,

our natural allies--

Saxons.

Anglos.

The very word means angels,
doesn't it?

Eva: Mmm...

lt's a tranquil image.

All the Germanic peoples

coming together.

The traitor Churchill...

never told his countrymen
that l offered an alliance,

a union of racial brothers...

and protection
of the British Empire.

Eva: Wolfie?

Wolfie?

ln a different era,
parts of me that were

compassionate and sensitive

might have developed
but, in my era,

there were forces
and attractions

that led me to become
the founder

and perfect leader
of the new religion.

Think of Volk and Reich!

Our great nation!

We prefer the spoken
to the written word.

More so, symbols
to any kind of words.

And above all,

pageantry, spectacle,
and music.

People thought
l choreographed

the Nuremberg Rally
to make the film

''Triumph of the Will.''

The critics lack
the imagination to see

that l orchestrated
World War ll,

for the same reasons...

the invasion of countries.

Mobilization of millions
of extras

to produce the most magnificent

and historic film footage,

footage delivered nightly

from the front by courier

for my personal review.

So, my sons and daughters,

take guidance from the arts...

to write a bestseller

or to stir a nation!

Simplify.

Your hero must have no fears

and you villain no need
of affection.

The fair maiden

must be blonde,

and the villain
must wear dark clothing

and a mustache.

Life is ambiguous.

None of us
can stand ambiguity.

Me, least of all.

lf you told the truth,

both the teller
and the listener

would go insane.

Tell me.
For you, what redeems life?

The purely artistic.

Read Nietzsche.

But what of the spiritual
dimension?

To be a creative artist,

one inevitably
walks the spiritual path.

ln fact,
they are the same path.

Hmm.

Good. Good.

But, there is so much more
to understand, Adolf.

So many died--
Stop!

Conscience is
the Jewish invention.

For us National Socialists,

action follows thought
as quickly as...

thunder follows lightning.

Hitler: Let's finish
this section.

Typist: ''Enigma,
carefully manipulated

enhances one's power
and fame.''

Hitler: Make that,
''Fame, power and immortality.''

Obfuscation keeps
people guessing--

the little feints,
the ambiguities,

contradictions...

ln my first four years,
as head of the Nazi party,

l forbade photos
to be taken of me.

To my surprise,

the efforts to keep
these things hidden

created a cloak of enigma.

People want to know.
They talk.

They were kept on edge.

Yeah, better delete
that last section.

Typist: You mean,
starting with the line

''obfuscations''?
No, no.

From ''There were things about me

that l was not
comfortable with.''

The horrors
of the First World War,

the turmoil
of the post-war years.

By the 1930s,

Germany was
an abused child.

From her wounds, grew...

National Socialism,

''the great healer.''

''The great healer.''

l can remember the first time
l spoke publicly.

ln 1919.

Or was it 1920?

Crowd of veterans...

disheartened, broken men

who'd spent four agonized years
in the trenches,

only to return
unappreciated.

Civilians could never know.

They were moved
by my words,

my fervor.

l could speak.

l remember...

one young man
in a wheelchair

who'd lost his legs--

there was an ecstasy
on his face.

l knew joy.

l had the power

to heal the sick.

As with Wagner's music,

people could
lose themselves

in the totality
of my voice.

One must be cautious, Adolf.

All people want
to be gods.

Unfortunately,
some do not recognize

the impossibility of it.

You're wrong.

Every man
has God within him.

Fortunately,

most people
don't recognize this.

There is no essence
beneath appearance,

only a series
of appearances,

each rising
out of the one before

and giving birth
to the next.

l merely fulfilled
the plans and programs

of my original sponsors.
