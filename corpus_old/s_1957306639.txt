( grunts )

( sighs )

Hmm.

( kisses )

( sneezes )

<i>( knock at door )</i>

Elaine! ( speaking Spanish )

I gotta get to my game.

That's disgusting!

So is your face. ( chuckles )

I'm gonna tell Mom!

( scoffs )
Grow up, tattletale.

Ugh!

Mami!
Carmen:<i> Ready? Here it goes.</i>

-<i> The ring doesn't lie.</i>
Shh, shh, shh.
Mami.

Girl, girl, I knew you
were gonna have a girl.

( laughs )
Ay, that's just superstition.

Oh, yeah? How about when
Elcie was having twins

and not even the doctor knew,

'cause the girl was hiding
behind the boy

and the ring kept changing
its swing from boy to girl?

Yeah, but you said that meant
the kid was gonna be gay.

My bad.

( both laugh )

If you're lucky,

she'll have green eyes
like Diego.

You can start calling him
Uncle Diego now.

Elaine, why aren't you wearing
your bathing suit yet?

Mom, I told you,
I don't wanna go.

Because you got your period?

Come on, we haven't been
to the beach all summer.

Why don't you just wear
one of the bathing suits
Titi Lizzy gave you, huh?

Like the burgundy one.
That way if you drip,
nobody could tell.

Trick of the trade.
Plus it's sexy.

She don't gotta be sexy.
She's only ten.

She's a seÃ±orita now.
You better get used to it.

You talk to me about sexy
when you have a girl.

I knew you were having a girl.

You know,
girls make your nose spread.

Mm-hmm.

Wah!

( all laugh )

<i>( birds squawking )</i>

( indistinct chatter )

Elaine. Elaine. Come on.

Let's go to the water. Come on.

Come on. Come on.

No, I'm OK here.

Lizzy:
<i>It's OK, you don't have</i>
<i>to take off your shorts.</i>

Why?
-<i> She doesn't want to</i>
<i>'cause she has her period.</i>

Titi Lizzy!

Come on, Lizzy.

Ay, please.
She'll get over it.

Hey.

Last one in the water
is a rotten egg.

What do you think, huh?

Come on.
Just up to your knees.

Come on, Elaine.

<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

Uh, I have to pee.

Again?
OK.

I'm pregnant.
One day you'll get it.

Toma Elaine, take this.
I'll go, too.

OK, we'll get the car.
Come on.

Elaine. Elaine.

Come here. Come on.

Hey. You didn't have
to be embarrassed
because you're bleeding now.

That's just a part
of being a woman.

Look. You see?

It's natural. It's normal.

You see?

It's normal.

Hmm?

I'm gonna go look for them.

Carmen:
<i>Elaine, is that you?</i>

Yeah.

Carmen:
<i>Come back here.</i>
<i>I have a surprise for you.</i>

( baby cooing )

Carmen:<i> Oh, she's so cute.</i>
Lizzy:<i> She's beautiful.</i>

Well, don't you want
to come meet your new cousin?

Come say hi
to Baby Alissa.

She's precious.

( cooing )

She's so cute.
I know.

Shh.

Titi Lizzy...

I have to tell you something.
