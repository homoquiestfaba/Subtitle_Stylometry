ANYTHING GOES AND SO--

(CAR BELL RINGS)

HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S MY CAR.

LOOK, I DON'T HAVE
ANY PARKING TICKETS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS MY CAR.

YOU KYLE BISHOP?

YEAH, THAT'S ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

YOUR CAR IS NOW PROPERTY
OF THE BANK.

YOU DEFAULTED ON YOUR LOAN.

WAIT, WHAT?
THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.

WHAT DOES THIS EVEN MEAN?

THE CAR IS BEING
REPOSSESSED, SIR.

THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
LOOK, SIR HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

LOOK, SIR, CAN YOU JUST
HEAR ME OUT?

UH, ANTHONY.

ANTHONY, CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME?

I MISSED A COUPLE OF PAYMENTS.
THAT'S ALL.

IT SAYS HERE
YOU'RE SIX MONTHS BEHIND

AND OWE ALMOST $4,000.

LOOK, MAN, CAN'T YOU JUST
CUT ME SOME SLACK ON THIS ONE?

JUST THIS ONE TIME. PLEASE.

LOOK, I'D LOVE
TO HELP YOU OUT, BROTHER.

BUT YOU SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT

BEFORE YOU TRIED LIVING
ABOVE YOUR MEANS.

LOOK, CAN I AT LEAST
GET SOMETHING

SURE. IF YOU GIVE ME THE KEYS.

FINE.

HAVE A NICE DAY, SIR.

YEAH. WHATEVER.

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

WHAT THE HELL YOU LOOKING AT?

VINCE, KYLE IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

YOU'RE LATE.

YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
A ROTTEN MORNING.

SO WHAT'S THE WORD?
WHERE AM I HEADED NEXT?

WELL, KYLE.

YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
THIS IS FOR ME TO SAY.

WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

I CONTACTED EVERY TEAM.

EVERY SINGLE TEAM.

I GOT NOTHING.

DUDE, WHAT ABOUT CANADA
OR THE UFL OR ARENA?

THEM, TOO.
CALLED THEM ALL.

NOTHING.

SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
NOT ONE TEAM CALLED ABOUT ME.

NO. A FEW DID.

THEN SOME YOUNGER PLAYERS
GOT RELEASED,

AND THEY WENT
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

YOUNGER PLAYERS? I'M 25.

I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT. MAN.

IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, KYLE, OK?

THIS IS A BUSINESS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THIS.

YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY LUCKY

TO GO FROM TEAM TO TEAM
THE WAY YOU HAVE.

THIS IS LUCKY?

VINCE, I'M LIVING OUT OF
MY GODDAMN SUITCASE,

FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

TALK TO ME.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

WHAT IS MY BEST
AND MY WORST CASE SCENARIO HERE?

IN MY EXPERIENCE,
DEALING WITH PLAYERS

IN YOUR SIMILAR SITUATION,

IT'S GONNA BE REALLY DIFFICULT

TO GET YOU A WORKOUT
WITH A TEAM RIGHT NOW.

BEST CASE SCENARIO,
YOU STAY IN SHAPE,

AND WE'LL ATTACK IT AGAIN
NEXT SEASON.

WORST CASE SCENARIO...

YOU MAY HAVE TO BEGIN ADJUSTING
TO LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

BECAUSE I'M NOT READY
TO BE RETIRED, MAN.

ALL I KNOW IS FOOTBALL.

THAT'S ALL I'VE DONE
MY WHOLE LIFE.

THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

KYLE.

IF ANYTHING COMES MY WAY,

IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,
ANYTHING CHANGES,

I WILL CALL YOU IMMEDIATELY.

BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW,

IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

I'M SORRY.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

THE MAN OF THE HOUR.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

SO YOU GOT A MINUTE?

UH, YEAH, I WAS GETTING READY
TO HEAD TO WORK,

BUT YEAH, COME ON IN.

WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?

OH, NO, I'M GOOD.

WELL, SUIT YOURSELF.

YO, YOU KNOW STACEY
IS REALLY DIGGING YOU, RIGHT?

MAN, THAT GIRL
AIN'T THINKING ABOUT ME.

SHE LIKE WHAT I REPRESENT.

WHATEVER, MAN. I CAN TELL.
SHE'S DIGGING YOU.

SOMETIMES THINGS AIN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM, BRO.

WHAT YOU MEAN?

I'M DONE PLAYING.

YOU THINK SHE'LL LIKE ME NOW?

WHEN THIS HAPPEN?

YESTERDAY, I MET WITH MY AGENT,

HE PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME
IT WAS A WRAP.

SORRY TO HEAR THAT, MAN.

WHAT, WERE YOU LIKE
DROPPING TOO MANY PASSES?

LIKE WHAT HAPPENED?

NAH, MAN,
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

SOMETIMES IT'S JUST POLITICS.

SO YOU BACK FOR GOOD NOW?

WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT
ALL THAT MONEY SAVED UP, RIGHT?

NOT EXACTLY.

WHAT?

I BLEW THROUGH
MOST OF THAT MONEY.

DAMN.

I GOT TO FIND A JOB.

WELL, YOU KNOW WE HIRING
AT THE GYM, RIGHT?

NAH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

YEAH, MAN, I COULD
TALK TO MY MANAGER.

SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

DUDE, RIGHT ABOUT NOW,
THAT WOULD BE DOPE.

LEAST I CAN DO.

I APPRECIATE IT.

ALL RIGHT, MAN.
IT'S GON' BE STRAIGHT.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DOING
LATER, MAN.

YOU CAN COME BACK THROUGH
AND WATCH THE GAME.

YEAH, HONESTLY, BRO,
I'D RATHER NOT, MAN.

ALL RIGHT. I GET IT, MAN.

I GUESS
I'LL HOLLER AT YOU LATER.

FOR SURE.
ALRIGHT.

I NEED YOU TO WRITE ONE FACT

ABOUT EACH
CALIFORNIA INDIAN GROUP.

NOW IN YOUR STUDY JOURNAL--

GIVE ME ONE SECOND, KIDS.
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

GOOD TO SEE YOU, KYLE.

OH, IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

SORRY TO DROP BY
UNANNOUNCED.

I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

IS EVERYTHING OK?

YES AND NO.

UM, I JUST NEEDED YOUR ADVICE
ON A FEW THINGS.

I'M SO GLAD
YOU SHOWED UP TODAY.

I COULD ACTUALLY
USE YOUR HELP, TOO.

SURE. WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

STEP INTO MY OFFICE.

TODAY IS CAREER DAY.

BUT THIS YEAR,
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN

IF WE HAD A GUEST SPEAKER
INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO ME

EXPLAIN WHY
I WANTED TO BECOME A TEACHER

FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME.

IT WAS BY CHANCE

THAT HE'S EVEN HERE WITH US.

KYLE BISHOP IS A REAL LIFE
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER.

HE USED TO SIT IN THAT CHAIR
RIGHT THERE.

BACK WHEN HE WAS IN
THE SECOND GRADE JUST LIKE YOU.

SO GIVE IT UP FOR OUR VERY OWN
KYLE BISHOP.

(KIDS CHEERING)

MR. EDWARDS,
I THINK I'M THE LAST PERSON

THAT SHOULD BE GIVING
THESE KIDS CAREER ADVICE.

YOU'LL BE FINE.

JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THEM
TO STAY IN SCHOOL,

AND ALL THAT
AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL STUFF.

GO AHEAD, KYLE.

ALRIGHT.

HI.

I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT I SHOULD BE SAYING UP HERE.

BUT I GUESS I'LL SPEAK
FROM THE HEART.

UM, WHEN I WAS YOU GUYS AGE,

I FELT LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE
WAS IN FRONT OF ME.

I WAS YOUNG,
I WAS IMPRESSIONABLE--

WHAT'S INCESSONABLE?


IMPRESSIONABLE.

IT MEANS EASILY INFLUENCED.

SO LIKE I WAS SAYING,

UH, LIFE IS ABOUT MAKING PLANS
AND SETTING GOALS.

AND WHILE IT MAY BE FUN TO BE

IRRESPONSIBLE AND LET LIFE
COME AT YOU FAST,

TRUST ME, THAT'S NOT
THE WAY TO GO.

I, MYSELF,I'M A PROFESSIONAL
FOOTBALL PLAYER.

AND WHILE THAT MAY SEEM FUN
AND EXCITING AND ALL,

EVENTUALLY, IT'S GONNA
COME TO AN END.

AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO RELY
ON EVERYTHING THAT I LEARNED

HERE IN THIS CLASS AND IN SCHOOL

TO TAKE ME TO THE NEXT LEVEL
OF MY OWN LIFE.

SO IN CONCLUSION,

THE NEXT TIME YOUR TEACHER
OR YOUR MOTHER

OR YOUR FATHER, WHOEVER,

ASKS YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP,

REALLY TAKE A MINUTE
TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ANSWER.

BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LUCKY,

YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

SO, LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS,
LISTEN TO YOUR TEACHER,

EAT YOUR VEGETABLES,

UH, PRACTICE SAFE SEX.

WHAT'S SAFE SEX?

MR. EDWARDS: VON!

TEACH, I'M SORRY I WASN'T
A BETTER SPEAKER TODAY.

YOU KIND OF PUT ME
ON THE SPOT WITH THAT ONE.

IT'S OK. YOU WERE FINE.

YOU WERE A LOT BETTER THAN MOST.

SO WHAT'S UP?

WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

PROBABLY HIS MOTHER.

HELLO, MISS DAVIS.
HE'S IN THE BACK.

AH, I GOT YOUR CALL.
I APOLOGIZE.

IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

VON, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

IF I HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE

AND GET YOU
OUT OF DETENTION AGAIN,

I'M GONNA...
THAT LITTLE BEHIND OF YOURS.

ARE WE CLEAR?

YES.
YES WHAT?

YES, MA'AM.
YES, MA'AM.

THAT'S BETTER.

CAN WE GO NOW?
I'M GONNA BE LATE TO PRACTICE.

MM-HMM. I KNOW. OK.
LET'S GO.

YOU REMEMBER KYLE, DON'T YOU?

KYLE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

HI, FAITH. HOW YOU BEEN?

YOU KNOW
KYLE PLAYS BALL NOW, RIGHT?

FIGURES.

LOOKS LIKE
YOU BEEN BUSY YOURSELF.

WOW, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU ARE STILL THE SAME.

CAN HE COME
TO MY GAME TOMORROW, MOM?

HE HAS BETTER THINGS TO DO
WITH HIS SATURDAY MORNING.

YOU KNOW WHAT,
SHE'S HALFWAY RIGHT.

BUT MAYBE NEXT TIME, CHAMP.

OK.

WELL, MISS DAVIS,

AT THE PARENT/TEACHER
CONFERENCE NEXT WEEK.

YES, YOU WILL. THANK YOU.

COME ON. LET'S GO, BABY.

BYE, FAITH.

WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

LONG STORY.

DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

NOT REALLY.

MANNING PARK.

MANNING PARK.
THAT'S WHERE HER SON PLAY.

YOU KNOW, IN CASE YOU EVER
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

SO, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU?

WHO ARE YOU?

HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
LARRY ARMSTRONG.

FRIEND OF YOUR MOM'S.

OK, I'M READY.

HEY, MOM. WHAT'S GOING ON?

OH, NOTHING MUCH.
I SEE YOU MET LARRY.

YEAH, WE MET.

YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO THE CASINO.

OH?

YEAH, SO DID YOUR AGENT CALL?

YEAH.

WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

LOOKS LIKE I'M-- YOU KNOW WHAT,
Y'ALL ABOUT TO LEAVE.

I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

AND WHERE IS YOUR CAR?

IT'S A LONG STORY.
WHERE'S CHRIS?

SHE MIGHT STILL BE AT WORK
OR AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

ALRIGHT, SO UH,
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE, OK?

HAVE FUN.

WELL, NOT TOO MUCH.

HEY, IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.

VERY WELL.

HEY, MA.

YEAH?

WHO IS THIS GUY?

JUST A FRIEND.

A FRIEND.

DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE A LITTLE OLD

TO BE HAVING NEW FRIENDS?

KYLE, I AM LIVING MY LIFE.

AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME.

KY. COME ON. GET UP.

KY. COME ON.

I KNOW. I'M ABOUT
TO GO TO WORK.

ON A SATURDAY?

WELL, THE MORTGAGE
DOESN'T PAY ITSELF.

SO WHAT HAPPENED?

I'M DONE.

WHAT?

I'M DONE PLAYING.

NONE OF THE TEAMS
WANT TO SIGN ME, SO I'M DONE.

AT LEAST FOR NOW.

SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
IN THE MEANTIME?

I DON'T KNOW YET.

ARE YOU GONNA AT LEAST
TRY TO GET WORK?

EVENTUALLY.

LOOK, YOU GOTTA GET UP
AND DO SOMETHING, OK?

AND I DON'T MIND YOU STAYING
HERE WHILE YOU FIGURE IT OUT,

OR DO SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE WITH YOURSELF.

CAN I JUST SEE WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN WITH MY CAREER FIRST?

YOUR CAREER.

UM, I GOTTA GO,
SO YOU MAKE UP THAT BED,

AND CLEAN UP THIS PLACE
BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE.

I AM NOT YOUR MAID.

YOU KNOW WHAT, SWEETIE...

MAYBE THIS IS FOR THE BEST.

SO IT SAYS HERE YOU'RE
A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER?

YES, SIR. I PLAYED FOR 3 YEARS.

SO WHY ARE YOU HERE APPLYING
FOR OUR CASHIER POSITION?

I'M DONE PLAYING, SIR.

I'VE SEEN
SOME STRANGE THINGS IN MY DAYS,

BUT NEVER A MILLIONAIRE APPLYING
FOR A REGULAR 9 TO 5 JOB.

IS THIS FOR SOME NEW
REALITY SHOW OR SOMETHING?

IT'S NOT, SIR.

AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU,
I'M NO MILLIONAIRE.

I USED TO PLAY, AND NOW I DON'T.

AND QUITE FRANKLY,
I REALLY NEED THIS JOB.

YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY EXPERIENCE.

WELL, EVERYBODY HAS TO START
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

I JUST NEED SOMEBODY
TO GIVE ME A CHANCE.

I DON'T KNOW.

SIR, I KNOW
MY SITUATION IS UNIQUE.

I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY.

I'M A VERY QUICK LEARNER.

IF SOMETHING OPENS UP,
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

HOW'S THAT SOUND?

YEAH. ALRIGHT.

FAITH?

KY. HELLO.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
SO I DECIDED TO STOP BY.

YEAH?

YOU STALKING ME?


NO, IT SEEMED LIKE VON REALLY
WANTED ME TO CHECK OUT HIS GAME,

AND WHAT I HAD TO DO
FELL THROUGH,

SO I STOPPED BY.

THAT'S KIND OF NICE OF YOU.

YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO COME OFF RUDE THE OTHER DAY,

IT'S JUST THAT SEEING YOU
WITH A KID THREW ME FOR A LOOP.

WHERE IS HE?

HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
WITH THE DIMPLES. (LAUGHS)

OH, I SEE HIM.
YOU SEE HIM?

HEY, VON!

MIND IF I STAY?

IT'S A FREE COUNTRY, RIGHT?

YEAH.

GONNA GO BACK HOME.
CLEAN UP THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW.

MAYBE GO TO THE MOVIES. YOU?

I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS.

YOU WANT TO HANG OUT,
CATCH UP A LITTLE BIT?

WHAT, NOW?

YEAH, WHY NOT?

RIGHT NOW
IS NOT A GOOD TIME, YOU KNOW?

NO, IT'S, YEAH, I GET IT.
IT'S COOL.

MM-HMM.

HIS DAD, RIGHT?

YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE JUST
COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW.

ASKING YOU OUT OR SOMETHING?

OH!

I'M SORRY FOR ASSUMING.
IT'S COOL.

WELL, I MEAN, IN THAT CASE,

VON'S BEEN AFTER ME TO GO
TO THE MOVIES LATELY.

GREAT GAME, BABY.

THANKS, MOM.
THANKS FOR COMING, KYLE.

HOW'D I DO?

YOU WERE GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

REALLY?
OF COURSE.

THANKS. OH, MA, CAN I GO OVER
TO CAM'S HOUSE?

I THOUGHT TODAY WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE OUR DAY.

MA, PLEASE?

ALRIGHT. WELL,
WE HAVE TO GO HOME FIRST

NO, MA, CAM'S MOM SAID
SHE HAS STUFF FOR ME TO WEAR.

REALLY?

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I GOT HIM, FAITH. IT'S OK.

HE CAN STAY OVER.

ALRIGHT. BE ON
YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR.

TAKE YOUR CLEATS OFF
IN THE HOUSE.

GO HAVE FUN.

BUH-BUH...MMM.

OK, LET'S GO.

SO, ABOUT THOSE PLANS YOU HAD.

SHUT UP.

YOU'RE DRIVING.

WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CAR?

OH, IT'S...IT'S IN THE SHOP.

OK.

OK.

YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF?

AH, WELL, YEAH.

THIS KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF OLD TIMES.

IS THAT A GOOD OR A BAD THING?

I'M NOT SURE YET.

WELL, I'M HAVING FUN NOW.

SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOURSELF NOWADAYS?

I WORK
IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

IS THAT LIKE A TELEMARKETER?

NO. LIKE, YOU EVER SEE THE UM,

PHONES WHERE YOU CAN MAKE
THE VIDEO CALLS

ON A BROADBAND LINE?

OH, YEAH.
SOME OF MY TEAMMATES GOT THOSE.

WELL, THAT IS WHAT I SELL.

SO IS THAT LIKE A 9 TO 5 JOB,
OR IS IT REFERRAL BASED?

REFERRAL.

HOW DO YOU EVEN
GET INTO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

MY EX.

VON'S DAD.
MM-HMM, YEAH.

UM, HE'S A REGIONAL REP,

AND WHEN I WAS IN
MY FRESHMAN YEAR,

I GOT PREGNANT,
HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL,

AND UH, THEN I WANTED
SOMETHING TO DO,

SO HE GOT ME STARTED.

SO HOW IS THAT
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

IT'S A GOOD JOB.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE JOB.

MM-HMM. NOSY. (LAUGHS)

WELL, YOU SAID
IT WAS COMPLICATED.

SO ARE YOU GUYS STILL TOGETHER?

NO.

HE CHEATED ON ME.

SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

I'M JUST GLAD I FOUND OUT
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.

ANYWAY, ENOUGH ABOUT ME
AND MY DRAMA.

WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

WELL, WHAT'S YOUR LIFE LIKE?

YOU KNOW VON
WANTS TO PLAY, RIGHT?

UH, YEAH, HAVE HIM PLAY
ANYTHING BUT FOOTBALL.

BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, GOLF,
HELL, EVEN HOCKEY.

THEY'RE ALL
GUARANTEED CONTRACTS.

FOOTBALL ISN'T.

BUT YOU GUYS
GET PAID WELL, RIGHT?

NOT ALL THE GUYS ON THE TEAM
ARE DOING IT BIG LIKE THAT.

FOR THE MOST PART,
THEY'RE LIVING CHECK TO CHECK.

WHAT DOES
AN AVERAGE PLAYER MAKE,

IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?

I'M NOSY?

DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT TRYING TO
GET IN YOUR POCKETS OR ANYTHING.

JUST CURIOUS.

NO, IT'S LIKE

250,000 IF YOU'RE ON
THE ACTIVE ROSTER.

MM-HMM.

80,000 IF YOU'RE ON
THE PRACTICE SQUAD.

AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS ON.

I WAS AN UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT.

THAT'S STILL A DECENT AMOUNT
OF MONEY, KYLE.

YEAH, BUT PEOPLE FORGET

THEN YOU GOTTA PAY YOUR AGENT
FIVE PERCENT.

YOU GET TAXED IN EVERY STATE
THAT YOU PLAY IN.

AND ON TOP OF THAT,
YOU ONLY GETTING PAID

16 WEEKS OF THE SEASON.

I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

YEAH. IT'S NOT
WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE. TRUST ME.

I HAD NO IDEA.

SO IF YOU HAD A SON,

YOU REALLY
WOULDN'T WANT HIM TO PLAY?

ABSOLUTELY NOT FOOTBALL. NO.

BUT YOU GUYS, MAN, YOU TRAVEL.

YOU KNOW? I HAVE NEVER BEEN
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA.

REALLY?
YEAH.

YOU STILL WOULDN'T WANT MY LIFE.
I LIVE OUT OF A SUITCASE.

I LIVED IN 9 DIFFERENT CITIES
AND 3 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

IN THE PAST 3 YEARS
TRYING TO PURSUE THIS DREAM.

IT WAS WORTH IT THOUGH.

YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS BUY
MY PARENTS A HOUSE AND RETIRE,

AND I CAN'T DO NONE OF THAT.

AND WHY NOT?

I'M DONE.

KYLE: THIS IS THE HOUSE RIGHT
HERE ON THE RIGHT.

THANK YOU, KYLE,
FOR A REALLY GREAT DAY.

I MEAN I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH
FUN IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

I THINK YOU SHOULD BE GOING.

YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

WELL, YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

YOU'RE WELCOME.
I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME.

I REALLY DID.

WELL, MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

OK, WE'LL SEE.

IF YOU'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING TOMORROW...

MAYBE YOU CAN COME OVER
FOR SUNDAY DINNER.

MAYBE I'D LIKE THAT.

OK.

AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE.
YOU REMEMBER WHERE THAT IS?

YEAH.

AROUND 6:00.

YOU KNOW I DON'T COOK.
I ORDER.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

ALRIGHT.

ALRIGHT.

6:00.

MM-HMM.

MARIE: THESE ARE MY RULES,
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM,

THEN YOU CAN GET OUT!

IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
WHAT I DO, OR WHO I DO IT WITH.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT ME
BEHIND MY BACK.

I HEARD YOU ON THE PHONE
TALKING ABOUT ME.

YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER. I CAN TALK
TO MY FAMILY ABOUT YOU.

WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU TO.
SO STOP IT.

GOD, YOU'RE ALWAYS GOSSIPING.

I DO NOT!
YES, YOU DO!

WHAT I DO IN MY PERSONAL LIFE
IS MY BUSINESS!

NOT WHILE YOU'RE UNDER MY ROOF
IT'S NOT.

LOOK, YOU PAY SOME BILLS
UP IN HERE,

THEN YOU CAN TALK TO ME
ABOUT SOME RIGHTS.

PLEASE. HERE YOU GO.

MISS THING, YOU DON'T RUN
NOTHING UP IN HERE

BUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH.

I SEE WHY KYLE NEVER COMES HOME.

OH, WELL, SO YOU'RE PROTECTING
HIM NOW? OH, PLEASE.

HE BARELY CARES ABOUT YOU
OR ME FOR THAT MATTER.

YES, HE DOES!

DID HE COME BACK
FOR YOUR GRADUATION?

DID HE CALL YOU
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?

EXACTLY.

I'M NOT LISTENING TO THIS.

I'M OUTTA HERE.

BYE!

HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, CHRIS?

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

O...K.

WELL, ALL RIGHT.

HEY. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

YEAH, WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

WELL, I HAD A DATE TONIGHT.

YOU REMEMBER FAITH DAVIS
FROM SCHOOL, RIGHT?

WE HUNG OUT.

WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

UM, DID YOU
TALK TO YOUR FATHER YET?

NAH, I HAVEN'T YET.

FIGURES.

I'M DONE ASKING ABOUT IT.

I'M GOING TO BED.

YOU EARLY?

WHY DO YOU SEEM SURPRISED?

COME IN.

YOU LOOK NICE.

YOU, TOO.

OH, THANK YOU.

KYLE.

GOOD SEEING YOU AGAIN.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

WHAT IS HE DOING?

YOU PUT THAT AWAY.

OH, I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST--

WE GIVE HUGS HERE.

OH, OK.

IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, TOO, MRS. DAVIS.

I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR APPETITE.

I DID.

GOOD. RON?

WHERE'S VON?

HE'S WITH HIS DAD.

WHAT'S GOING ON, BABY?

HEY, YOU REMEMBER KYLE, SWEETIE?

HE TOOK FAITH TO PROM.

AND HE'S GOING TO BE
JOINING US FOR DINNER.

OH, THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FINE.

THE MORE THE MERRIER.

I'M GONNA GET CHANGED.

ALL RIGHT.

WOULD YOU GUYS COME ON.

GET A ROOM OR SOMETHING.

OH, WE GOT A ROOM. WE GOT ROOMS.

HOW YOU THINK YOU GOT HERE?

DAD!

OK, OK.

DON'T MIND MY MOM.
THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

SO HOW DID YOU TWO RECONNECT?

WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER

WHEN I WENT TO PICK VON UP
FROM SCHOOL THE OTHER DAY.

SMALL WORLD, HUH?

VERY.

SO KYLE, WHAT IS IT
ALL THAT YOU DO?

MOM.

WHAT?

THAT IS JUST RUDE.

NO,IT'S FINE.
I'M A FOOTBALL PLAYER.

BEVERLY: OH.

I USED TO PLAY BALL.
IT'S COMPLICATED.

I'M KIND OF
IN BETWEEN TEAMS RIGHT NOW.

PROFESSIONAL?

I PLAYED A LITTLE BALL MYSELF
BACK IN THE DAY, YOU KNOW.

OH, HERE WE GO.

YEAH, I SCORED THREE TOUCHDOWNS
THE LAST GAME I PLAYED.

SO YOU PLAYED COLLEGE BALL?

YEAH, AT HOWARD.
WHAT SCHOOL YOU WENT TO?

AKRON.

IT'S IN OHIO.
RIGHT NEXT TO CLEVELAND.

ALL RIGHT. DOES ANYONE WANT
ANYMORE FISH, CHICKEN, ANYTHING?

OH, NO, I'M FULL. THANK YOU.

I'M FINE.

OK, HONEY?

I'LL TAKE
A LITTLE BIT MORE, TOOTS.

ALL RIGHT.
COMING RIGHT UP.

YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE TOUR?

YEAH. LET'S GOOD.

LET'S GO. EXCUSE US.

WOW, YOUR PARENTS
REALLY HAVE A NICE HOUSE.

THANK YOU.

THANK YOU FOR THE TOUR, TOOTS.

WHAT?

NO. I THINK YOUR PARENTS
ARE GREAT.

I MEAN I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOUR DAD CALLS YOUR MOM TOOTS.

IT'S LIKE
I WAS WATCHING AN EPISODE

OF   <i>THE COSBY SHOW OR SOMETHIN.

OK.

NO, I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF YOU.
I THINK IT'S NICE.

I CAN TELL YOUR PARENTS
REALLY, REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

I MEAN, YOU GUYS
SIT AT THE DINNER TABLE.

YOU EAT TOGETHER. YOU TALK.

DON'T ALL FAMILIES DO THAT?

NOT MINE.

WE BARELY EVEN
TALK TO EACH OTHER.

WELL, WHY NOT?

FAMILY IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

I MEAN, I SPEAK TO MY PARENTS
ALMOST EVERY DAY.

WOW. WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER

REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

THEY DO, BUT DON'T
LET THEM FOOL YOU.

THEY HAVE THEIR PROBLEMS
JUST LIKE ANY MARRIED COUPLE.

THEY JUST WORK A HELL OF A LOT
HARDER THAN MOST

TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. YOU KNOW?

YOU KNOW I WAS LOOKING THROUGH
SOME OF MY OLD STUFF YESTERDAY.

I CAME ACROSS THIS.

OH, MY GOD.

YOU...WOW.

YEAH, I KEPT IT.

"I WANT TO TELL YOU I NEED YOU.

"I WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I CARE.

"BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
MY EXISTENCE.

"IT SEEMS YOU ACT
AS IF I'M NOT HERE.

FAITH/KYLE: "I COULD BE ENOUGH
TO LOVE YOU FOREVER...

"I COULD BE THE ONE
TO SHOW YOU HEAVEN.

"YOU COULD BE WITH ME
SO HAPPY TOGETHER.

"FAITH, I'LL MAKE YOU BELIEVE.

WOW. THIS IS UM...

THAT'S THE POEM YOU GAVE ME

WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO PROM
JUNIOR YEAR.

IT'S STILL TRUE.

UM...WOW.

LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

OH...

WITH MY HAND

HEY, YEAH

IN YOUR EYES, I REALIZE

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME

YOU'RE CONNECTED
TO THE AIR I BREATHE

WON'T YOU STAY WITH ME

STAY WITH ME, YEAH

THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

THAT WAS NICE.

YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I NEEDED THAT.

I NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO APOLOGIZE--

DON'T.

JUST ENJOY THE MOMENT.

AND HOLD ME.

GUESS WHO I HUNG OUT WITH
THE OTHER WEEKEND.

I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL ME. WHO?

FAITH.

FAITH DAVIS?

YOU KNOW ANOTHER FAITH?

THAT OLD THING BACK, HUH?

WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

IT'S FUNNY
YOU MENTIONED THAT, MAN.

I ACTUALLY
BUMPED INTO HER MYSELF.

OH, YEAH?

YEAH, SHE STILL LOOK GOOD.

SHE GOT A LITTLE KID
NOW THOUGH, RIGHT?

YEAH. YEAH, VON.

IS THE UH, THE DAD
STILL IN THE PICTURE?

NAH, SHE SAID SHE CAUGHT
DUDE CHEATING

AND KICKED HIM TO THE CURB.

DON'T DO IT, BRO.
DON'T DO IT, MAN.

HOLD UP, MAN.
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

WHAT YOU THINK
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

DATING A WOMAN THAT GOT A KID.

YOU NEVER WILL BE THE NUMBER ONE
PRIORITY IN HER LIFE.

EVER.

NAH, IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT WITH FAITH.

AND SHE SAID DUDE DON'T EVEN
BEING AROUND LIKE THAT.

WHAT IF HE TRIES TO GET BACK
IN HER LIFE THOUGH?

AND YOU KNOW
FAITH IS A GOOD GIRL.

SHE'S NOT GONNA DENY HIM
ACCESS TO HER KID.

HELL, HE COULD CALL HER
RIGHT NOW.

AND SHE WOULD HAVE TO
STOP EVERYTHING

TO SEE WHAT THIS FOOL WANT.

MAN, IT SOUND LIKE YOU BEEN
THROUGH THIS A COUPLE TIMES.

I'M NOT TELLING YOU
WHAT I THINK.

I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT I KNOW, MAN.

WHY YOU HATIN'?

I'M NOT HATIN', MAN.

YOU ACT LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW FAITH.

FAITH IS COOL AND ALL.
I LIKE HER.

IT'S JUST THAT...

WHAT, MAN, SPIT IT OUT.

IT'S JUST THAT WHEN I SEEN HER,
SHE WAS WITH DUDE.

WHAT YOU MEAN SHE WAS WITH DUDE?

I MEAN THEY WERE ALL OUT
TOGETHER.

FAITH WAS WITH SOME DUDE,

AND THE LITTLE KID
WAS WITH THEM.

AND LOOKED JUST LIKE HER.

WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS LOOKING
LIKE ONE, BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

I MEAN, THAT'S COOL.

I MEAN, SHE SAID
HER SITUATION WAS COMPLICATED,

SO I CAN'T BE MAD.

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

EXCUSE ME.

YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON, CHRIS?

WHAT?

HEY, I'M LOOKING FOR
SIDNEY BISHOP.

BISHOP. LET'S SEE HERE.

OH, HE'S IN THAT ROOM
RIGHT OVER THERE.

BYE, DADDY.

HEY, DAD.

KYLE?

HEY, SON. (CHUCKLES)

WHAT HAPPENED? I CAME OVER
AS SOON AS CHRIS CALLED.

UM...

JUST COMPLICATIONS
FROM MY DIABETES, THAT'S ALL.

I'LL BE FINE.

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FOOT?

HAVE A SEAT, SON.

THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS LOSING
CIRCULATION IN MY LEGS,

AND IF I WANTED TO LIVE,

THEY'D HAVE TO TAKE
PART OF MY FOOT.

WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANYBODY
WHAT WAS GOING ON?

WELL, YOU WERE PLAYING BALL,
AND YOUR SISTER WAS IN SCHOOL.

AND WELL, YOUR MOTHER,
YOU KNOW HOW SHE CAN GET.

YOU CAN TALK TO ME, DAD.
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

THE DOCTORS SAY,
NOT NOW, BUT EVENTUALLY...

I'LL NEED A TRANSPLANT.

TRANSPLANT WHAT?

I HAVE CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

OK, SO HOW LONG ARE THEY SAYING?

HOW LONG, DAD? MAYBE
I CAN DO SOMETHING TO HELP.

A COUPLE YEARS.

A COUPLE OF YEARS.

NO. NO, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO.

YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU.

THIS IS MY PROBLEM, KYLE.
NOT YOURS.

YEAH, BUT YOU'RE MY DAD.

I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

JUST LIKE YOU TOOK CARE OF ME
WHEN I GOT SICK.

NONE OF THIS IS HAPPENING
THE WAY I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

WHAT ARE YOU TALK--

TALK TO ME, KYLE.

DAD, HAVEN'T YOU EVER
WONDERED WHY

IT TOOK ME SO LONG
TO COME SEE YOU?

I KNEW YOU'D COME BY.
JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

NO. I DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS.

I MEAN I HAD A FEELING
YOU WAS DOING BAD,

HELL, IT'S MY FAULT THAT YOU'RE
EVEN IN THIS SITUATION.

YOU AND MOM
WOULD'VE NEVER GOT A DIVORCE

IF I WOULD'VE BEEN A BETTER SON.

I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE TO
FIX EVERYTHING.

I NEVER KNEW YOU FELT LIKE THAT.

WE NEVER DID HAVE THAT TALK,
DID WE, SON?

LOOK...

NONE OF THIS
IS YOUR FAULT, KYLE.

WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND YOUR MOTHER...

WAS JUST LIFE.

WE WERE MARRIED
FOR 19 GREAT YEARS.

SHE GAVE ME
TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN

FOR WHICH I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
AND NO REGRETS.

I'VE LIVED MY LIFE, SON.

DAD, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE GIVING UP.

I'M NOT GIVING UP, SON.
NOT ONE BIT.

BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HARBOR FEELINGS

FOR SOMETHING YOU HAD
NO CONTROL OVER.

IF ANYTHING, YOU AND YOUR SISTER

ARE WHAT HELD US TOGETHER
FOR SO LONG.

AND WHAT KEEPS ME GOING NOW.

WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

LIVE YOUR LIFE.

AND KNOW THAT I PLAN ON
FIGHTING THIS THING.

LOVE IS THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS.

AND KNOW THAT EVEN IF WE DON'T
TALK FOR AWHILE,

NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...

KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU, BOY.

I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD.

WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE THIS THING OUT.

HOW'S HE DOING?

THEY RELEASED HIM TODAY.
HE SEEMS LIKE HIS OLD SELF.

I TOOK HIM HOME AND MADE SURE
HE WAS ALRIGHT.

HOW ARE YOU DOING?

I'M FINE
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?
ARE YOUR PARENTS TOGETHER?

NO, MY PARENTS DIVORCED
A YEAR AFTER I WENT TO COLLEGE.

WOW.

THE ONLY REASON WHY YOUR PARENTS
STAYED MARRIED WAS...

BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
IT WOULD BENEFIT YOU.

I SHOULD'VE
SAW IT COMING THOUGH.

THEY NEVER WOULD HOLD HANDS.

NEVER WENT ON ANY DATES.

THEY DIDN'T SHOW EACH OTHER
ANY TYPE OF AFFECTION.

NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER

THE LAST TIME
I SAW MY PARENTS KISS.

REALLY? THAT'S CRAZY.

YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
I'M SO MESSED UP.

YOU'RE NOT SO BAD. MOVE OVER.

UH...

VON, CAN YOU GIVE US
A SECOND, BABY?

YOU EVER GET TO THAT POINT
IN LIFE

WHERE YOU REALIZE
THAT EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVED IN

IS COMPLETE, UTTER BULLSHIT?

LIKE YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE WORKING
TO GET TOWARDS SOMETHING

AND YOU GET A TASTE OF IT,
AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU REALIZE...

IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH
PURSUING ANYMORE.

THAT'S WHERE I'M AT.

I USED TO THINK LIKE THAT, TOO.

BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

I COULD BE BITTER
ABOUT STAYING HERE.

ABOUT HAVING VON WHEN I DID.

BUT YOU'VE GOT TO FOCUS
ON WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY.

TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THINGS
YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER.

KYLE, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

I JUST BEEN THINKING
ABOUT MY LIFE A LOT LATELY.

I THINK I'M GONNA JUST,
JUST GO AHEAD

AND GET MYSELF A REGULAR JOB.

DOES THAT MEAN
WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?

YEAH.

YOU SURE?

I JUST DON'T LOVE IT ANYMORE.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY
JUST CAME OUT MY MOUTH,

AND I MEANT IT.

WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO INSTEAD?

I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

I MEAN I,
I APPLIED FOR A JOB AT THE GYM.

I'M JUST WAITING
TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM. WHAT?

WELL, MY MAJOR IN COLLEGE
WAS COMMUNICATIONS, SO...

LATER ON DOWN THE LINE,
I MAY GET INTO RADIO.

BUT HONESTLY, I DON'T,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START.

YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO
TO ANOTHER CITY

TO START DOING THAT.

YOU KNOW IT'S HARD
TO BREAK INTO THAT IN L.A.

I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE HERE THOUGH.

THAT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS LOVED
ABOUT YOU. YOUR HONESTY.

YOU KNOW MOST GUYS THESE DAYS

CAN'T EVEN HAVE
A DECENT CONVERSATION.

WELL, IT'S EASY TO BE HONEST

WHEN EVERYTHING
YOU EVER WORKED FOR IS A LIE.

I DO HAVE SOMETHING
TO ASK YOU THOUGH.

AND I NEED
YOUR COMPLETE HONESTY.

OK.

ARE YOU STILL WITH VON'S DAD?

NO. ME AND HIM ARE DONE.

I'M SURE. WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME
SOMETHING LIKE THAT? YEAH.

I ASKED YOU BECAUSE I THINK

THAT WE SHOULD
BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

OFFICIALLY.

I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

A YES WILL SUFFICE.

YEAH.

CAN I BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU?

YEAH. PLEASE DO.

I AM NOT REALLY LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW.

OH, THAT, THAT'S COOL.

WHY?

WELL, FOR ONE, WE SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE THIS CLOSE

BECAUSE OF VON.

DON'T YOU THINK
THAT IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE?

I DON'T KNOW.

WE DO HAVE A HISTORY AND...

YOU FEEL SO SAFE.

YOU ARE DIFFERENT.
YOU CHANGED.

I GOT CHANGE IN MY POCKET.
I'M BROKE.

JOIN THE CLUB.

I DID LIE TO YOU THE OTHER DAY.

ABOUT WHAT?

ABOUT MY CAR.
IT'S NOT IN THE SHOP. IT...

I SKIPPED A COUPLE OF PAYMENTS,
AND IT GOT REPOSSESSED.

EVERYBODY HAS TO
START SOMEWHERE.

YEAH.

YEAH.

IF I COULDN'T AFFORD TO GIVE YOU
THE FINER THINGS?

I MEAN I KNOW
YOU'RE USED TO THAT AND ALL.

IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY, KYLE.

IT HAS NEVER BEEN
ABOUT THE MONEY WITH ME.

IF YOU'RE WORKING
TOWARDS YOUR DREAMS,

WE'RE TOGETHER,
I'LL SUPPORT YOU.

I JUST...OH....

AS FAR AS US
MAKING THINGS OFFICIAL,

JUST YOU KNOW, GIVE ME
SOME TIME TO THINK IT THROUGH.

DON'T MAKE ME WAIT TOO LONG.

YUCK.

I GOT YOUR YUCK.

I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

THESE ARE MY LUCKY
RECEIVER GLOVES.

I WEAR THEM AND EVERY OTHER
RECEIVER I KNOW WEARS THEM,

AND I WANT YOU TO WEAR THEM.
I FOUND YOUR SIZE.

COOL.

VON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

THANK YOU.
OH, ARE YOU GONNA COME

TO MY PLAYOFF GAMES
NEXT SATURDAY?

IF WE WIN, WE PLAY
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD, BUDDY.

I'M THERE.

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BYE, Y'ALL.


(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

HELLO?

HEY, KYLE. HOW YOU DOING?

ADJUSTING.
HOW ABOUT YOURSELF?

NO COMPLAINTS.
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

I GOT SOME WONDERFUL NEWS
FOR YOU.

YOU HAVE A WORKOUT
IN JACKSONVILLE THIS WEEK.

IT'S ALL SET UP FOR TUESDAY.

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHAT?


IT'S A GREAT ORGANIZATION
WITH EVEN BETTER WEATHER.

WAIT, WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THAT
STUFF YOU WAS TALKING ABOUT

GETTING ADJUSTED
TO LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL,

AND YOU TRIED
EVERYBODY IN THE LEAGUE?


GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

I JUMPED THE GUN A LITTLE BIT.
I APOLOGIZE.

DAMN, MAN, YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH
PEOPLE'S LIVES LIKE THAT, VINCE.

I MEAN I THOUGHT I WAS
DOING YOU A FAVOR.

IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE YOU WANTED
TO EVEN PLAY BALL ANYMORE.

BUT I AM SORRY, OK?

AND THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT.
THAT'S IN THE PAST.

LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

I HAVE YOU ON A 4PM FLIGHT
OUT OF LAX TO JACKSONVILLE.

VINCE, CAN I AT LEAST GET
A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT THIS?

WHAT IS THERE TO THINK ABOUT?
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED THIS.

I DID. I MEAN, I DO, VINCE.

I JUST,
A LOT OF STUFF HAS CHANGED

I NEED...I NEED A MOMENT
TO SORT THINGS OUT, MAN.

KYLE, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY ATHLETES

WOULD'VE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY
THAT I JUST PRESENTED YOU?

I KNOW, VINCE. I KNOW, I KNOW.

MY JOB IS TO GET YOU PAID.
ARE YOU GONNA LET ME DO MY JOB?

SO HOW ABOUT THIS,
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT UP TO YOU.

YOU LET ME KNOW
WHEN I CAN DO MY JOB

SO I CAN BOOK THE FLIGHT, OK?

YEAH. YOU HAVE MY WORD.

ALL RIGHT? BYE.

WOW. WOW, WOW, WOW.

(DOOR UNLOCKS AND OPENS)

WHAT'S GOING ON, FAITH?

WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
ANSWERING ANY OF MY CALLS?

RELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I HAVE MY WAYS.

AREN'T YOU
GONNA ANSWER MY QUESTION?

I'VE BEEN BUSY.

YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

YOU NEVER COULD LIE TO ME.

WHAT DO YOU WANT, RELL?

I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

WHERE'S VON?

WITH MY PARENTS.

WELL, WE NEED TO TALK.

WHAT ELSE
IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

WE ARE DONE.

YOU NEED TO STOP
COMING BY MY HOUSE UNANNOUNCED.

WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE.

HMM?

LOOK...

JUST BECAUSE
I MADE A BAD DECISION

DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M NOT A GOOD MAN.

IT MEANS THAT I'M HUMAN,
AND I MADE A MISTAKE.

I BEEN TRYING TO DO THINGS
YOUR WAY, FAITH.

NOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT MINE.

I AM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

I MADE A MISTAKE, AND I'M SORRY.

HAS BEEN THE HARDEST THING THAT
I'VE EVER HAD TO DO IN MY LIFE.

NOW I SHOULD'VE DONE THIS
A LONG TIME AGO.

I WANT US TO BE A FAMILY.

FAITH DAVIS, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

LARRY, I'M TELLING YOU.

I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU WENT TO SLEEP IN THE MOVIES.

THAT MOVIE WAS BORING, BABY.

HEY, KY.

HEY, MOM. WHERE Y'ALL
COMING IN FROM?

OH, ME AND LARRY
WENT TO THE MOVIES.

I NEVER KNEW YOU
TO GO OUT SO MUCH.

WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW.


HERE YOU GO.

WHY YOU LET HIM
TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT?

AND WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

EXCUSE ME?

NOBODY ASKED YOUR OPINION.

THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND MY MOTHER.

YEAH, WELL,
NOW YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

YOU KNOW, YOU COULD USE
A HEALTHY DOSE OF MANNERS, SON.

DUDE, YOU DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT ME.

I KNOW ENOUGH.

LOOK, LARRY. I THINK THAT--

NO, NO, THIS IS FINE.
MAYBE HE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.

THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY THE MOST
SELFISH PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

LARRY!

I MEAN, LOOK AT YOUR LIFE, SON.

YOU ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
ONE OF YOUR DREAMS.

I MEAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE IN LIFE
GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT?

AND YOUR MOTHER HAS SACRIFICED

FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER SO THAT
YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT,

AND WHAT YOU LOVE TO DO, AND YOU
DON'T EVEN APPRECIATE IT!

LARRY!

I AIN'T GOTTA LISTEN TO YOU.
YOU AIN'T MY FATHER.

NO, I'M NOT YOUR FATHER.

BUT THE FACTS REMAIN.

YOU KNOW, LARRY, I THINK
THAT YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH, OK?

YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH.

YEAH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

(DOOR CLOSES)

YOU BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT
BEHIND THEIR BACKS, HUH?

LOOK, I DIDN'T ASK HIM
TO SAY ALL OF THAT.

BUT SINCE YOU'RE SO CONCERNED
ABOUT PEOPLE TALKING,

WHY DIDN'T YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CAR?

IT GOT REPOSSESSED, KYLE.
DAMN IT.

BECAUSE IT'S MY PROBLEM.
I'LL FIX IT.

SON, IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON,

OH, WHATEVER, HUH? I MEAN
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

WELL, I'M LEAVING TOMORROW
FOR JACKSONVILLE,

SO YOU AIN'T GOTTA WORRY
ABOUT ME NO MORE.

OH. OH, YOU'RE LEAVING SO SOON.

WELL, DID YOU AT LEAST,

DID YOU AT LEAST
GO SEE YOUR FATHER?

YEAH, MORE THAN YOU HAVE.

WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU
AND YOUR SISTER LATELY,

BUT BOTH OF YOU REALLY NEED--

WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY, MA?

BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE ENOUGH
TO GO SEE HIM YOURSELF?

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

HE NEEDS A HEART TRANSPLANT.

OH, MY GOD.

OH, LIKE YOU CARE.

OH, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

BECAUSE YOUR FINALLY
WENT TO VISIT YOUR FATHER

AFTER I BEGGED YOU TO DO IT?

DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT
CARING ABOUT SOMEBODY.

I WILL ALWAYS CARE
FOR YOUR FATHER.

BUT WE AREN'T MARRIED ANYMORE.

HE IS NO LONGER
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

NOW I WILL KEEP HIM
IN MY PRAYERS,

BUT YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARE HIS SON.

AND YOU
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HIM

JUST LIKE HE HAS ONE TO YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOT TO FOCUS
ON MY OWN LIFE NOW.

SHIT, I GOT PROBLEMS OF MY OWN.

AND THAT'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM.

WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, KYLE?

SHOW THAT YOU CARE!

HELL, I KNOW I DON'T VISIT
OR CALL AS MUCH AS I SHOULD,

BUT DON'T MAKE ME FEEL WORSE
ABOUT IT THAN I ALREADY DO.

THAT MAKES ME NOT EVEN
WANT TO COME OVER AT ALL.

KYLE, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
AND YOUR SISTER.

AND I LOVE YOUR DAD, TOO.

WELL, THEN START SAYING IT.

AND YOU NEED TO TALK TO HIM
YOURSELF BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

YOU SITTING UP HERE
TALKING BAD ABOUT ME,

AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING THIS FOR.

IT'S NOT FOR FOOTBALL.

HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL
BEING IN THE LEAGUE,

KNOWING THAT MY MOM
GOTTA WAKE UP ON SATURDAYS

AND PULL A DOUBLE SHIFT?

OR THE FACT THAT MY FATHER
IS SITTING IN A HOSPITAL BED,

AND I CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT IT?

IT'S KILLING ME INSIDE, MA.

I LOVE YOU. BUT I GOTTA
FIGURE THIS THING OUT.

AND IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT'S FOR ALL OF US.

HOW ABOUT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

(DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS)

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

THE WALLS START CLOSING IN
UNTIL YOU JUST CAN'T BREATHE

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

YOU'RE SPINNING AROUND
SO DIZZY

TILL YOU JUST CAN'T SEE

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

YOU'RE FALLING, FALLING,
FALLING, TUMBLING DOWN

FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

WAKE UP BEFORE YOU
HIT THE GROUND

(PHONE RINGS)

HEY, DAD.

HEY. SON. WHAT'S UP?
EVERYTHING OK?

YES AND NO.
SORRY TO CALL YOU SO LATE.

WHAT HAPPENED?

I MIGHT HAVE A WORKOUT
WITH JACKSONVILLE NEXT WEEK.

FOR REAL? CONGRATULATIONS!

IF EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT,

I'LL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR MEDICAL BILLS.

KYLE, IF YOU WANT
TO PLAY BALL, GOOD.

IF NOT, THEN DON'T.

DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU THINK

YOU HAVE SOME OBLIGATION TO ME
OR SOMETHING.

YEAH, BUT I THINK I CAN HELP.

REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU.

DO IT FOR THE LOVE,
OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL.

HEY.

I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU.
I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

AFTER YOU LEFT,
MY AGENT CALLED ME.

HE TOLD ME I GOT A WORKOUT
WITH JACKSONVILLE.

REALLY, WHEN?

TUESDAY. IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

YEAH. YOU GOING?

I DON'T KNOW YET.

YOU DON'T KNOW?

I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T LOVE IT ANYMORE.

WELL, THAT WAS BACK
WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE AN OPTION.

NOW THAT IT'S REAL, I'D BE CRAZY
NOT TO CONSIDER IT.

WHAT, BABE? I CAME HERE
TO GET YOUR ADVICE.

MY ADVICE? IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE
ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND.

BABE, THIS IS A BIG
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME.

I MEAN, I'VE BEEN BAD
WITH MONEY BEFORE.

BUT IF I MAKE THIS TIME,
I CAN HELP EVERYBODY OUT.

THEN GO.

WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?

BECAUSE THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
THAT YOU'VE DONE THIS TO ME.

YOU WERE MY FIRST EVERYTHING.

MY FIRST KISS.

MY FIRST DATE.

MY FIRST LOVE.

YOU BROKE MY HEART.

WHAT, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO
COLLEGES IN DIFFERENT STATES?

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

FAITH, I NEVER KNEW
YOU FELT THAT WAY.

I HAD DREAMS
OF GETTING AWAY, TOO.

I THOUGHT WE AGREED THAT THIS
WAS THE BEST FOR BOTH OF US.

NO. YOU AGREED.

IT'S NOT FAIR. YOU RUNNING IN
AND OUT OF MY LIFE LIKE THIS.

I HAVE A SON!

FAITH, I WAS YOUNG.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WANTED.

IT'S DIFFERENT NOW.
I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

I WANT YOU.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED YOU.

I THINK MAYBE I WAS NAIVE
TO BELIEVE YOU HAD CHANGED,

BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

WHAT ABOUT VON'S GAME?

YOU PROMISED HIM THAT YOU WOULD
GO TO HIS GAME ON SATURDAY.

NOW HE'S GONNA BE CRUSHED.

FAITH, COME ON.

IT'S NOT EVEN GUARANTEED
THAT I'LL MAKE IT.

THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DO NOT
LET PEOPLE GET CLOSE TO ME.

NOW YOU UNDERSTAND?

I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

IF I MAKE IT,
I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

HE'S 7! KYLE, OF COURSE
HE WON'T UNDERSTAND. JUST--

HEY, IS EVERYTHING OK?

YEAH.

I'M FAITH'S FIANCEE.

NO.

FIANCEE?

I DON'T BELIEVE YOU, FAITH.

YOU SITTING UP HERE
MAKING ME FEEL BAD

FOR PURSUING MY DREAM,
AND YOU'RE ENGAGED.

RELL IS NOT MY FIANCEE.
I DID NOT SAY YES.

YOU DIDN'T SAY NO EITHER.

MARCUS WAS RIGHT.

HE TOLD ME
HE SAW YOU TOO TOGETHER,

AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO BELIEVE HIM.

YOU BEEN PLAYING ME
THIS WHOLE TIME.

WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

I AIN'T TALKING TO YOU.

JUST GO BACK IN THE HOUSE.
PLEASE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

YOU BETTER TAKE CARE OF IT

BEFORE I TAKE CARE OF IT
FOR YOU.

WOW.

HOW LONG AS THIS
BEEN GOING ON, FAITH?

IT'S NOTHING, KYLE.

HE'S BEEN TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY
BACK INTO VON'S LIFE,

AND HE CAME BY
AND PROPOSED TO ME.

WHEN WAS YOU GONNA TELL ME?

THERE WAS NOTHING TO TELL.

HERE I AM ABOUT TO CHANGE
MY LIFE FOR YOU,

AND YOU BEEN LYING TO ME.

THERE WAS NOTHING TO TELL.

I CAN'T CONTROL
WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

HE JUST SHOWED UP, KYLE.

HE JUST SHOWED UP.
IT'S NOTHING.

I'M OUT, FAITH.

KYLE.

KYLE.

KYLE!

VINCE, I'M IN. SET IT UP.

OH, NO, MAN. I COULDN'T
HAVE MY BOY ON THE BUS.

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

BUS DRIVER, I GOT A DOLLAR,
I DON'T HAVE 1.50,

BUT I GOT A DOLLAR.
CAN I LIVE?

PLEASE. BUT UH, NO, MAN.

I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
WOULD WORK OUT THOUGH, RIGHT?

YEAH, YOU WERE RIGHT.

BEING RETIRED AT 25
JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT, MAN.

YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT FAITH, TOO.

WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

YEAH, I GOT PLAYED.

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

YEAH, MAN, I SHOULD'VE
SAW IT COMING, TOO.

I WENT OVER TO HER HOUSE
LAST NIGHT

TO TELL HER ABOUT THE WORKOUT
AND DUDE WAS OVER THERE.

AND PROPOSED TO HER.

DID SHE SAY YEAH?

IT DOESN'T MATTER.
SHE LIED TO ME.

I'M GETTING OUT NOW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE REALLY
FEELING HER THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

YEAH, MAN, IT'S CRAZY,

'CAUSE I THOUGHT THIS TIME
IT WOULD WORK.

THERE'S OTHER GIRLS, RIGHT?

RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT, MAN.
MAKE IT HAPPEN, MAN.

I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES.
I APPRECIATE IT.

GOOD LUCK. PEACE.

THANKS, BABE.
YOU'RE REALLY HOLDING ME DOWN.

I'M SURE IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

I'M SURE IT WILL.

I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA
TAKE CARE OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

YOU GOTTA TRUST ME.
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

I DON'T NEED YOU STRESSING OUT
OUR LITTLE GIRL

BEFORE SHE EVEN GETS HERE.

I KNOW. PUT MY LITTLE MAN
ON THE PHONE FOR ME PLEASE.

HEY, BUDDY. YOU MISS YOUR DADDY?

WELL, HE MISSES YOU.

ARE YOU BEING GOOD?

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

DON'T GIVE YOUR MOM
A HARD TIME, OK?

AND I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

PUT YOUR MOM BACK ON THE PHONE.

(CELL PHONE CONTINUES BUZZING)

ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

I'M ABOUT TO GO TO BED, OK?

WISH ME LUCK AGAIN.

I LOVE YOU.

BYE.

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

FAITH: KYLE,
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T

PICK UP THE PHONE, SO...

I GUESS I'LL JUST
SAY THIS MESSAGE.

I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
WHAT WAS GOING ON

BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

THEN RELL CAME BY THE HOUSE
AND PROPOSED OUT OF NOWHERE,

AND I JUST, I JUST
FEEL REALLY BAD

FOR THE WAY
EVERYTHING HAPPENED.

I KNOW I HAVE NOT GIVEN YOU
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE ME,

BUT I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

FOR MAKING YOU FEEL BAD
FOR DOING WHAT IT IS

YOU FELT LIKE YOU HAD TO DO.

IT WAS EXTREMELY SELFISH OF ME
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD FOR IT.

AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

I DON'T KNOW, IT MIGHT NOT
MEAN MUCH TO YOU NOW,

BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE TIME THAT WE SPENT TOGETHER

THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

IT REALLY FELT LIKE OLD TIMES,
AND I WANT YOU TO...

I WANT TO WISH YOU NOTHING
BUT SUCCESS WHEN YOU WORKOUT.

AND I KNOW YOU'LL GET IT
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

I...I GUESS I'LL BE SEEING YOU
ON TV THEN.

GOOD LUCK. BYE.

WELCOME TO JACKSONSVILLE.

AS YOU BOTH KNOW, WE'RE LOOKING
TO SIGN A RECEIVER.

WHO WE DECIDE TO GO WITH,

WILL BE STRICTLY BASED
ON PERFORMANCE TODAY.

NOW WE BROUGHT YOU BOTH IN

BECAUSE WE FEEL YOU BOTH
CAN FIT INTO OUR SYSTEM.

WE'VE ALREADY GONE OVER
GAME FILM,

AND ASKED YOUR PREVIOUS COACHES
ABOUT YOU.

TODAY, IT'S ABOUT
WHO WANTS IT MORE.

LET'S GET A QUICK STRETCH IN.
AND WE'LL GET TO IT.

HEY, GOOD LUCK TODAY, MAN.

YOU, TOO. DREW IRVIN.

KYLE BISHOP.


BEEN ABOUT A PRAYER
AND BEING HOMELESS AT TIMES

LOOKING HIGH IN THE SKY
FOR A SUN

HOPING GOD I HEAR MY HEART
BEAT, POUNDING LIKE THUNDER

WHILE I'M RUNNING
LIKE THE WIND

IT'S HOT AS HELL
IN THE SUMMER

LOOKING FOR THAT SILVER LINING
IN A CLOUD, AND I'M RUNNING

TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT,
YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

WITH NOTHING ELSE FEELS RIGHT,
STANDING ON THE FIELD RIGHT

THINKING THIS IS REAL LIFE

DISAPPOINTMENT IS MOTIVATION

JUST ME AND THE CONCRETE,
MY FEET MEET THE PAVEMENT

STANDING ON MY OWN TWO,
NEVER MIND WHAT I WON'T DO

ASK ME WHAT I WON'T DO,
MY LUCK BEEN RAN OUT

LOANS DUE, CAR NOTE LATE

PHONE CALLS,
THE BANK OWN YOU

LOOKING FOR THEY CUT,
THE BANK OWNS YOU

HOW CAN ONE'S FIGHT
AGAINST THE ODDS

WHEN THE ODDS
ARE AGAINST THE ONES

PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION
AND CRANK THAT STARTER

BE WISER, BE SMARTER

PUSH FURTHER, PUSH FARTHER

PUSH FASTER, PUSH HARDER

THIS IS WAR,
BETTER PUT ON YOUR ARMOR

BE WISER, BE SMARTER

PUSH FURTHER, PUSH FARTHER

PUSH FASTER, PUSH HARDER

HARDER, HARDER, HARDER...

THIS IS WAR,
BETTER PUT ON YOUR ARMOR

BE WISER, BE SMARTER

PUSH FASTER, PUSH HARDER

YOU BOTH
HAD A GREAT WORKOUT TODAY.

UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

TO MAKE A DECISION TODAY.

WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE FILM,

GONNA TALK TO THE HEAD COACH,
AND THE HEAD OF PLAYER PERSONNEL

TO SEE WHO WE'RE GOING TO SIGN,

IF WE END UP SIGNING
ANYBODY AT ALL.

NOW YOU TWO OUGHT TO BE
VERY PROUD OF YOURSELVES.

YOU LEFT IT ALL OUT THERE
ON THE FIELD.

NOW WE'LL BE TALKING
TO YOUR REPRESENTATION,

AND LET THEM KNOW EITHER WAY.


HEY

I WOULD LEAVE
IF YOU BEGGED ME TO GO

HOW COULD I LEAVE YOU
WHEN YOU NEED ME MOST

THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE
IN A LOT OF YOUR LIFE

WHO HAVE TRIED THEIR BEST
TO STAY WITH YOUR LIFE

BUT WHEN I WANT TO SEE
YOU AS WE GROW

SO I OFFER MY SHOULDERS
TO CARRY YOUR LOAD

AND I'LL BE AROUND

BECAUSE I KNOW YOU NEED ME

I'LL BE YOUR FRIEND IN NEED
BECAUSE WE'RE FAMILY

I'LL BE AROUND

'CAUSE I KNOW YOU NEED ME

I'LL BE YOUR FRIEND IN NEED

JUST LIKE YOU'RE FAMILY

FAMILY

I HEARD YOU REAP
ALL THAT YOU SOW

WHEN YOUR CROSS COME IN,
YOU'LL ALWAYS GO

JUST LIKE THE TREES DO,
I'LL ALWAYS BE

SOMETHING THAT
STAYS THERE...

KYLE.

HEY.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

KEEPING MY PROMISE.

I TOLD VON I WOULD
MAKE HIS GAME, SO HERE I AM.

WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR WORKOUT?

I LEFT IT ALL ON THE FIELD.

OK, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

I'M HERE.

FAITH, I KNOW I WAS A JERK.

I JUST SAW HIM STANDING THERE,
AND I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU.

AND MY MIND JUST STARTED FILLING
WITH THESE THOUGHTS AND...

I GOT JEALOUS.

IT'S STUPID, AND I'M SORRY.

VON DESERVES HIS FATHER
IN HIS LIFE.

AND I WAS WRONG FOR MAKING YOU
FEEL BAD FOR THAT.

IS HE HERE?

HE'S TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY
BACK IN VON'S LIFE,

BUT TODAY HE TOOK THE DAY OFF.

I TOLD YOU
I WASN'T GONNA MARRY HIM.

WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

BECAUSE I'M STILL
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

FAITH, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MY LIFE IS HEADED.

BUT I CAN'T MOVE
IN A FORWARD DIRECTION

IF YOU'RE NOT THERE WITH ME.

FAITH, THE WOMAN
ISN'T BEEN BORN YET

THAT FEELS AS CLOSE TO ME
AS YOU DO.

EW, YUCK!

I TOLD YOU I WAS COMING.

I KNOW.

I LOVE YOU, TOO.

(CELL PHONE BUZZES)

SERIOUSLY? SERIOUSLY.

THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

IT'LL BE REAL QUICK.

JUST STAY THERE. JUST...

HEY, WHAT'S UP, VINCE?

KYLE. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE

WHO I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH.

I GOT SOME GREAT NEWS FOR YOU.

OOH

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH


TIME IS ON MY SIDE TODAY

FEELS LIKE I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING NEW

MANIFESTING LESSONS
AND POWER MOVES

NEGATIVE PEOPLE, STAY AWAY

NO

JUST WANT TO GET BACK
SIMPLY WHAT I GIVE

AND THEN FOCUS
ON MY POSITIVES

IT'S SUNSHINE

'CAUSE NOW'S MY TIME

ENJOYING LIFE

AND NOW ALL RIGHT

INTO THE SKY

AND DREAM AWAY

IT'S JUST A START

OF LOVE EACH DAY

AND I'LL JUST WAIT,
JUST FADE AWAY

TODAY'S MY LUCKY DAY

TODAY'S MY LUCKY DAY

EVERY WAY TAKES ONE OR SHAPE

TODAY'S MY LUCKY DAY

WE GOT LOVE, LOVE

SUGAR AND SPICE
IS WHAT IT'S MADE OF

AND IF WE WORK ON THIS LOVE,
LOVE

THIS LOVE
COULD BE TRULY WONDERFUL

I'VE BEEN THINKING I COULD
REALLY MAKE A LIFE WITH YOU

LET'S CREATE A WORLD
DESIGNED WITH A VIEW

THOUGH SOME DAYS
MAY BE CLOUDY

I'LL GO
THROUGH THEM WITH YOU

SHARE THIS LIFE WITH YOU,
MY FRIEND

THROUGH THE THICK AND THIN

WE GOT A LOVE, LOVE

SUGAR AND SPICE
IS WHAT IT'S MADE OF

AND IF WE WORK ON THIS LOVE,
LOVE

THIS LOVE
COULD BE TRULY ONE...


I CAN'T FORGET
ALL THE TIMES WE SHARED

I KEEP 'EM SAFE
HERE IN MY HEART

SO WHEN I GO IN
ALL THE TRUST IS THERE

YOU HOLD ME DOWN
WHEN TIMES ARE HARD

I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT,
I LOVE IT

I LOVE IT

AND I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT,
I LOVE IT

YEAH, TO MAKE AN IMPACT
ON YOUR LIFE IS PRICELESS

NOTHING QUITE LIKE THIS
TO SEE

OUR FEELINGS ARE LATE
LIKE LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT

IT'S ONE IN A MILLION

AALIYAH'S HEART
WOULD WRITE THIS

GIVE ME A REASON WHY
I WAS, GOT TO FIGHT IT

I'M THE GOLDEN CHILD,
SON OF A MATHEMATICIAN

I MULTIPLY THE LOVE JOY
NEVER APPLY DIVISION

AND I APPRECIATE YOU

TUPAC MY MIND IS GIFTED

IT'S HOW MY LIFE WAS WRITTEN
BEFORE THE STORY WAS HEARD

JUST LISTEN, BEFORE THE ONES
WHO ACCEPTED A YOUNG EM

THE FAME REFLECTED WELL
TO THESE GOLD MINING HONEYS

THEY GOT CAUGHT
IN MY CONVERSATION

SO I KNOW IT TOO WELL

AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR MIND
AND WISDOM

SHOWS THAT YOU SEE
THE VISION

I WOULDN'T BE HERE
WITHOUT YOU

YOU'RE MY FIX, I'M LIKE
SHE WITHOUT DRUGS

FEED MY ENERGY,
BABY, I NEED POWER

AND WE CAN TURN
HATE INTO LOVE

EVERY HOUR WE ON

I CAN'T FORGET
ALL THE TIMES WE SHARED

I KEEP IT SAFE
HERE IN MY HEART

SO WHEN I GO AND ALL
THE TRUST IS THERE

YOU HOLD ME DOWN
WHEN TIMES ARE HARD
