Now, do you remember
where you're hiding him?

All I want to do
is help him.

My brother will never
be one of you.

Is it worth it to die
for the secret?

Listen,
we could save you.

You can be
a normal human again.

This woman, she is a doctor.
She can help you.

We're not far from
discovering an antidote.

Tom, he doesn't
care about that.

Yes I do.

You could be
healthy again.

You can all
be healthy again.

An antidote?

Yeah.

For what?
For this?

Is that what
the bitch told you?

Carrie, are you still doing
your old doctor trick?

Do you still wear your
white smock like before?

You don't really believe
she's a doctor, do you?

She pretends
to be a doctor

so she can get close
to the family members.

That's what she does.

She's vampire hunter.

There is no antidote,

and there sure as hell is
no cure for your brother.

Tom, it's not like that.

What is so different
this time?

Everything she
promised you is a lie.

She wants to kill
your brother, not me.

Fuck you.

She tricked you
and she used you.

I hope for your sake

you haven't gotten
too close to her.

She's very good
at getting people

to fall in love
with her.

I have to find him,
do you understand?

I have to find him and
you are going to tell me.

I don't know
where he is.

I know.

I know where his
brother's hiding.

Where is it?

Get Pashek first.

Why don't you tell me?

Because you're not
in charge here.

I will only talk
to your master.

I need his word
he'll let us go.

Carrie, have them put us
in a car first...

Tom, please.

So, you want his brother.

You want him so bad,
we're still alive.

What's so special
about his brother? What?

But I want something
from Pashek in return.

If you tell me,
I'll let you go.

You have my word.

Fuck that.

How's your hand?

Rotting yet?

You know it'll eat its way
through your whole body.

I'll watch you eat
your own entrails!

First...

why don't you give
that to your master?

Tell him this time
he can't escape the Devil.

So you want me
to come with you?

And you want me
to give her my word.

A human?

Your fucking idea to bring her
here in the first place!

We need the man.
The woman's useless. Kill her.

Should we really kill her?

We are all going to die
because of you.

No, we're safe here.

Oh, really?
In this shithole?

Has your rotting arm caused
you to go blind as well?

You will never find him.

We need to be
on that ship now!

We need to evacuate!

I thought I could trust
my life with you,

you of all people.
It'll heal!

But he will find me!

I won't allow that.
Oh, really?

Will you shoot him?

He wants me to know
he's here.

He's mocking me.

He can't find us here.

Don't you understand?

It's him, Vlad Kossei,

the Devil himself!

Be not afraid of him.

I defeated him once before
and now I have his brother.

I'll find him.

Bring me the bitch.

Do you remember me?

Too bad I wasn't fast enough
to get you back then.

Too bad I can't cut you
right now.

Oops!
Aw.

I might as well get used
to the way you taste.

No! Don't!

Get her!

Shit!

Shit!

You okay?

Of course I'm not.

Who are you really?

I don't have much time.

Thank you for sharing
some of it with me.

This is Paul Cramer,
my lawyer.

Please, what is this about?

I'm Dr. Carrie Rieger
from the Riverdale Institute.

I'm sure you've never
heard of us.

We're specialized in
psychosomatic illnesses

with extreme inclinations.

Your brother
Christopher Clayton

was being treated
at Livermore Hospital.

He disappeared from
there five days ago.

You didn't say this was
about his brother!

We're treating him
at home now.

Tom, don't say anything.

The Riverdale Institute
is uniquely equipped

to deal with the disease pattern
your brother's exhibiting.

Miss Rieger, I must insist
that you leave immediately.

Has his jaw transformed yet?
Hey hey hey!

Everything's all right, Tom.
This is just the beginning.

Thank you for your visit.
Send your materials.

Mr. Clayton is very well-known
for his generosity

to charitable institutions.

As soon as his teeth start to
change, stay away from him.

We don't need
any more publicity.

"You're in danger.
Don't trust anyone."

Believe me, we're doing
exactly the right thing.

Is that it?
No wallet?

What do you mean,
"Is that it"?

Fuckin' lucky to be alive.

So it was two vampires.

The watch and the necklace
were from the big one,

the rest is
from the other one.

That was a rating 2.

And what's this?

They had those
around their necks.

Since when do vampires
carry stakes around?

Maybe they're trying
to help us out.

You also had a ring?

If you don't mind,
in the future make a list

of what you got
off of which vampire.

That goes for all of you.

Next time we'll be sure
and write their names down.

It's not about the names.
It's about transparency.

Do you think we're stealing?
Why don't you just listen?

Come on, answer me, Sid.

Hey hey hey, enough talk.

Everyone follows the rules.
Okay?

That includes
you and me both.

Now sit down, Grant,
sit down.

We're vampire hunters,
not fucking accountants.

Yeah, but we still
have to pay our bills.

Speaking of money,
we need new motion sensors

for the house perimeter.

And I need a new crossbow.

Forget it.

What's wrong with
the motion sensors now?

Three of them crapped out
from the rain.

I don't know which is worse,
the vampires or the bank.

We just need richer vampires.

Right on.
So, what are we, muggers now?

Of course not.
It's like the vampires

have to make a donation
to the cause.

Because they don't
do so voluntarily,

we have to extract it
from them.

We used to want
to fight evil, didn't we?

Now it seems like
all we care about is money.

It's always been like that.

As far as I'm concerned,
they're vampires...

scum... and they don't have
a fucking claim to anything.

That's why we take
what we can get.

So what are we on today?

I went to see that
Thomas Clayton guy...

you know, the rich dude.

Yeah, but we don't really know
he's a vampire, remember?

He showed the typical symptoms
of the transformation.

Very weak symptoms.

In any case, he has disappeared
without a trace

and I think his brother's
hiding him.

If all the vampires
bit him on his trip

he'd have mutated long ago.

Not necessarily.

I've seen it take
several weeks.

He's cute.

And rich.

I think this guy
knows exactly

that his brother's
a ticking time bomb.

I ain't gonna wait until
he bites them.

They always wait
too long.

He looks sad.
He called me.

Ah, the old
"don't- trust-anyone" trick.

He wants to meet
with me...

without his lawyer.

Excellent! You find out
where his brother is, got it?

We'll do the rest.

I don't want anymore
solo performances.

Don't screw up. We could
really use a rich vampire.

Chris?

Maybe you
should wait here.

Chris?

Where is he?

Gone.

Your brother lives here?
Yeah.

I keep telling him, but he
never opens the window.

How long has he
been like this?

Since he got back.

Oh my God.

No.
Don't touch him.

Oh, shit.
That's Paul, my lawyer.

Not anymore.

Where the hell
is my brother?

He took him.

Who?

The one who did that.

I just wanted
to look at it.

I risk my life
every fucking day.

Put it back.

Lately I've been thinking about
whether this is all worth it.

Looking like that,
I think I'd even tell you

where my brother
was hiding...

if I had one.

We're gonna take
Grant's cousin with us

so he can learn the
virtues of being a hunter...

waiting in the car.

All we have to do
is find out

where the brother's hiding.

Must have been
about a year by now.

He's dead...

at least to me.

If it would
make it easier...

I don't need help
from you

or anyone else, Keaton.

I buried him and forgot
about him a long time ago.

Like you said,

it wasn't my fault,
right?

Last couple of nights
it's been quiet,

too quiet.

I don't like it.

Something the vampires
don't like either.

What do you think
of their story?

What, that the vampires
are gathering?

That was a desperate vampire
begging for his life.

He meant that they're
gathering and fleeing,

like animals
from a forest fire

that you can't see yet.

What's that
supposed to mean?

Are we ready
to go yet?

Right, let's go.

Remember:

never trust a vampire.

No, I'm not a doctor,

but I can explain.

Feel free.

They're coming through.

I know these doors.

I've tried to get
through 'em often enough.

We have to get out of here.

No, way.

How?

Let's negotiate
with them.

They're vampires.
They don't negotiate.

You negotiated before.

I was just trying
to buy some time.

Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

I trusted you,
"Dr." Rieger.

What was I supposed to say?

"Excuse me. I think
your brother sucks blood,

Can I please just drive
a stake through his heart?"

I'm sorry that stuff
about the cure was a lie.

And I'm not a doctor. But
everything else was the truth.

What the hell was that?

What are they doing?

They're coming through.

We're trapped.

There's coffins in here.

This is a hideout,

which means it's protected from
people getting in, usually.

But there was always
an escape route...

for emergencies.

Great.

Tom, they won't hurt you.

Wait.
What do you mean?

I'm gonna go get help.

Trust me.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, you are not gonna
die here today.

I promise.

What if they're already waiting
for you on the other side?

Try and buy me
a little time.

She isn't here.

You think she's
already yours?

More of us are waiting
on the other side, bitch!

It's gonna be
a very short breakout.

Take him to the bunker.

We still need him.

What's your plan, Carrie?

What's your play?

She should be
through by now.

She's still here.

The door.
The door!

Ha!

Caught us with our pants down.

Yeah.

Stay by the door.

Against the wall.

Keaton.

It's Sid.

His skull's been crushed.

Any bite marks?

No.

Guys?

I think there's something
over there.

Stay by the door.

One of Pashek's people?

No.

Black stake.

Keaton.

Where are the others?

Did you see him?

Yes.

I was with Clayton.

Jill, where
are the others?

It's gonna be okay.

I...

saw the Devil.

They're still here.

Fuck. They're
still here.

Protect his brother

and do not let him

find him.

Vlad Kossei.

Against the wall.
See this?

Yeah.

Paralyzes them.

Can you use a gun?

Okay, you are now
a vampire hunter.

Flash first, shoot second.

And don't shoot at us.

Okay?
Okay.

Carrie, it's too late.
Come on, leave her.

Nothing you can do.

I'm sorry.

Me upstairs,
you downstairs?

Whatever it is,
we need it alive.

Shit!

I said don't shoot!
Shit!

He just moved.

Dead.

It doesn't take long for
vampires to decompose.

They may twitch a bit
when the gases escape.

Showtime!

Don't'!

We have to find out
what happened here.

Shit!

Hold him!

Leave him.

It will hold.

Told you.

Whose group are you with?

Whose group?

Do you understand us?

Of course he understands us.

He will kill you first.

He will kill all of you.

He will drink your blood!

Who's your master?

And what's with these stakes?

Come on, bitch.
I'll fuck you

and you will love it.

Shh.

Kid, you better
get out of here now.

He's gotta learn sometime.

Baby, let me free.

We can fight like men.

It won't do you any good.

No matter what you do, it
won't do you any good at all.

He's back, and
you'll be first!

Do you understand?

He already knows you.

What are you guys gonna do?

We're gonna make him talk.

Vlad Kossei!

What did you say?

Vlad Kossei.

Vlad Kossei!

I can't believe I didn't
see this straightaway.

We can't keep him
here forever.

Not forever,

but if we interrogate him
using the hooks now,

we'll only get one chance
and he'll probably lie anyway.

A couple of days without blood,
he'll sing like a bird.

About what?

Vlad Kossei,

the Devil himself.

Derek.

What a pretty name,
really.

How long have you been
a vampire hunter?

I got this in the
Carpathian Mountains.

They're in Transylvania.

I know.
I remember.

The figures match.

It must be some kind of

vampire rune to repel evil,

or attract it.
I don't know.

There's blood in here,
vampire blood.

These things haven't been used
for hundreds of years.

Have you killed before?

It's a fantastic feeling.

It makes you feel

powerful.

Jill gave this to me
before she died.

She said she'd seen
the Devil himself.

What is this Vlad Kossei?

Just a vampire ghost story,
that's all.

But... well,

it was extremely cold
in the 12th century.

They say it was like
a mini ice age.

It snowed until June.
Crops failed all over Europe.

The first cases
of the Plague broke out.

It was a bad time,

even for the vampires.

The vampire sovereigns
needed to blame someone

for the situation.

They needed a scapegoat.

Hence, Vlad Kossei,

"the Devil himself."

But I don't think
he really existed.

But someone's trying to convince
the vampires that he does.

Maybe it's a young vampire

trying to get ahead
using the old legends.

Killing vampire hunters is a
great way to attract attention.

He's either pretending to be
Vlad Kossei

or says that
he can defeat him.

Maybe it's one who refuses to
subordinate to the ancients.

That would mean war.

We've seen that before.
Reminded me of a vampire rune.

I never gave it
another thought.

I'm the first vampire you've
ever seen, aren't I, Derek?

I'm the first vampire you've
ever seen, aren't I, Derek?

I have to confess something.

The binds on my arm
are loose.

I think I might even be
able to free myself.

What harm could I do
with one arm free?

That crazy bitch
would probably just

cut off another
one of my fingers.

Even I know that

I could use
a friend down here.

Would you be my friend?

Will you?

I'm gonna drive over
to Parker's,

see if I can get
some of his guys.

We can't survive
another attack.

There's only two of us.

So, tighten the binds

and tell those
crazy assholes out there

that I'm cooperating.

Will you do that for me?

Please, Derek?

Please?

What about the kid?

Well, he wanted to be
a vampire hunter.

Now he is one.

Help help!

I wasn't going to hurt him.

Derek, you have to
believe me.

I wasn't gonna hurt you.

There you go.

I have a good heart.

You all right?

If you are
even going to believe

an old vampire like me,

such a good heart...

Do something with it.

Hello there.

Showtime.

You can't maim a prisoner

for trying to escape.

Hold him.

Hold him.

Jesus.

It broke off.

We will "talk" later.

Why is he
so important?

We have to find her.

We cannot let her
leave this house.

I can still take any
one of you,

so find her!

Get her up.

Caught so quickly.

You didn't learn
that from me.

You're nothing
since I left.

At least I didn't let them
bite me like you did.

Now listen to me, Carrie.

You have to tell me where
this brother is hidden.

If you help me,

I can help you.

What about your boss...

your precious master?

If he's so all-knowing...
Don't throw your life away.

Maybe he'll make
you one of us, hmm?

Then we can be
together again,

this time forever.

Matt, you can't cheat death
without paying for it.

But we do.

What do you dream about

when you sleep
in your coffin?

What do you dream about?

A price we vampires
have to pay for immortality.

Think about what it is
you used to fight for.

You can do it.

You don't know what
it means to be a vampire.

My name is Fork now,

and believe me, I'm
nothing like I used to be.

Where are you hiding
the bastard?

I can take you there.

The apartment with
the pictures on the wall...

yes, we've been there.

We've been watching you.

You were the first one
to turn us on

to Clayton and his brother.

We would have known nothing
about them if it wasn't for you.

She smells like fear.

It's like I said,
she doesn't know anything.

Useless. Kill her.
Bring me Clayton.

Maybe we can
still use her.

There's another
hiding place.

Sure, my dear.

And what will you give me
if I let you live?

St. George, the dragon slayer,

patron saint
of all vampire hunters.

Your friend here
used to wear the same amulet.

But now he belongs to me.

So close to death,

yet there's still
one question

burning deep inside,
isn't there?

I can see it in your eyes.

Who is Vlad Kossei?

This is the third time
I ran away. I can't go back.

Who cares?

You're old enough.
You can do whatever you want.

Stop whimpering.

Stop bleeding.

Is it true your boyfriend
became a vampire?

He's dead.

All vampires
are already dead.

He can't breathe.

Did you forget already?
He tried to kill you.

Jesus Christ,
he could kill us all.

Yeah, I know.

No you don't.

Look at him.

Look at him!

You don't know them.

You don't know
what they're like.

They're not human.

Look at his cold, dead eyes.

He doesn't give a flying fuck
about you or your dreams!

They just bite you!

Never show pity.

You got a lot to learn,
Derek.

So I can be like you?

What's wrong?

It's getting light.

And he's scared to death.

He can't see you,
he can't hear you anymore.

He can't feel
anything anymore,

not until this evening.

Sunlight petrifies them.

Best time to kill them.

We track them
during the day,

smoke them out
of their hideouts,

and watch them burn
in the sunlight.

We hunt them during the day,
they hunt us at night.

I thought you were gonna
bring Parker's people.

Parker's dead...

rubbed out.
The whole group,

just like us.

Wilson's group too.

We're the only ones left.

You have to find out where
Clayton's hiding his brother.

Three groups
of vampire hunters

in one fucking day.

Chris is an architect.

His offices specialized
in restoring old buildings.

They got jobs from...
Was this a church?

Yeah.

This was his last project,

a dirty old church
in Romania

the communists
used as a pigpen.

He always had
a photographer with him.

He was really
proud of these

old drawings
on the church walls.

They were discovered
during restoration.

They were hidden in an old
walled-up crypt,

drawings of the passion
of Christ.

They must be really ancient.

He was really excited
about it.

He thought it was going to be
this huge discovery.

And then he
started to change.

At first I thought it
was just work and stress.

Then it got worse
from day to day.

I told him he should
go see a doctor again.

That was the day

I started becoming
afraid of him.

It was like he was
slowly transforming

into someone else.

Did he take
anything with him,

some kind of object,
anything special?

Why?

Because this isn't
the passion of Christ.

Christ wasn't burned.

This was a warning
to the people.

What is this?

I didn't know
what to do.

Hey!
Can you hear me?

He's not feeling good.
What's wrong with him?

When's Keaton coming back?
He's off doing research.

He needs blood.
He needs warm, fresh blood.

Damn it!

Watch his hands.

If he starts to wake up,

he's gonna move first
and try to bite me.

Give me that crowbar.

I need to open his mouth.
Get me the crowbar.

Never thought I'd
have to feed a vampire.

That's good.

That's enough!

I know why your blood
tastes so good.

It's the hate in you!
I can taste it.

You think you're better
than us, don't you, hunter?

But you're just like us.

You kill because
you love it!

What is this?

This is a church in Romania.

What did they find
in that church?

The fools!

You're curious friend
didn't just find anything.

He found Vlad Kossei!

What do you know of
Vlad Kossei and his power?

Nothing.

Oh, you might have read
something in books.

But I was there.

I was there
when I burned him,

when I tracked him down
800 years ago.

We thought we had gotten rid
of him once and for all,

the monster Vlad Kossei.

We vampires
are not monsters.

We're not like Vlad Kossei.

We maintained the balance
with the humans

in our home long ago.

They feared
and respected us.

They were happy

because we protected them

as a shepherd
protects his sheep.

But then,

one day,

one day he came...

Vlad Kossei.

His thirst for blood
was unquenchable.

He would wipe out entire
villages in one night.

It was a nightmare.

The humans formed an army,
a pitiful force.

He swept them away
before the battle even began.

He destroyed them
from within.

Deceit and treachery were
his most powerful weapons.

Deceit and treachery,

that's what we learned
from him.

We vampires couldn't
defeat him on our own,

we knew that much.

So we formed a secret alliance
with the humans.

We made a pact to destroy
Vlad Kossei.

Vampires and humans...

he wasn't expecting that.

We pledged allegiance
to Kossei,

gained his trust,
then drew him into a trap.

He underestimated us.

That was his failing.

Your St. George
did not defeat a dragon.

He defeated Vlad Kossei.

I am your St. George!

But he wasn't dead.

Ultimately we had to tie
him to a scaffold.

We stacked wood beneath it

and then burned the flesh
from his bones.

Some thought
he was a demon,

an evil spirit
in a vampire's body.

So the humans
took the bones

and brought them
to their final resting place

for dangerous spirits.

They sealed him
in an altar in their church.

He was practically
dead already

the instant he was
bit by Vlad Kossei.

Your wayward friend
has become Vlad Kossei!

The fools woke
the Devil himself!

What does that mean?

He will cut the smiles
from your faces.

You will learn
what true fear is,

what true pain feels like.

It means that Vlad Kossei
is back.

You need me

more than I need you.

I could destroy him before
he regains his power,

before his transformation
is complete.

But he will become
invincible

when he destroys
the last link.

What link?

We should work
together...

humans and vampires.

It's the only way
to defeat him.

We have to
start by...

trusting each other.

What link does he
have to destroy?

Maybe I'll remember

if I could drink
a little more blood.

Okay.

Derek, I need
you to help me.

I know this is gonna
be gross,

but it's our only chance
to get him to talk straight.

He won't last.

Vlad Kossei has to kill
his brother!

That's it.

His spirit is dependant
on the blood in his veins!

As long as that same blood
still exists in another person,

he will only become
a shadow of his true self.

Do you understand?

He would have to
kill his parents

if they were still alive...

or his children.

But he definitely
has to kill his brother.

But he won't
kill his brother himself.

He won't murder
his own blood.

He would instantly lose the
connection to his new body.

That's why he will need
a new ally.

Your hate

blinds
you to reality.

Vlad Kossei wanted you to know
that he'd been found.

You're already part
of his plan.

He wants to use you

to kill his brother.

What?

But his plan will fail.

The vampires will take his
brother someplace totally safe,

safe from you

and Vlad Kossei.

Derek, stay here.

Tom?

Tom Tom!

Hello, Carrie.

Too slow again.

It's nothing.
It's nothing. I'm fine.

As you can see,

your efforts to save
your new friend have failed.

Just like the last time,
what I want I take.

Vlad Kossei will kill you.

I'm not afraid of him.

I've defeated him once.

I'll defeat him again.

Not unless humans and vampires
work together again.

You won't be needing this
anymore, hunter.

Take her to my coffin.

No!
Hold her!

It's him!
Impossible!

No, he can't be!
It can't be him.

It's her people,
vampire hunters.

No, I can feel him!

Get us out of here.

You stay here.
You'll be safer here.

Vlad Kossei.

Vlad Kossei!

Here.

You should have killed me.
Do you remember?

You had the chance.

Next time I will kill you.

Matt, Vlad Kossei is here
to kill his brother.

You can't defeat him
on your own.

Even now you think
you can still save me.

You should have left the vampire
hunters long ago.

You don't belong there.
It's not your war.

Try to get a life,
a real life.

Matt,

come with me.

You're not responsible
for saving the world.

I always knew
you would return,

I really did.

I realized a lot,
all these years.

I realized
you are my refuge.

Please, not like this.

I'm the heir of Imraz.

not in this shabby room.

Do you think it's him?

Vlad Kossei couldn't
have found us.

We have to get to the ship.

It's Vlad Kossei.

Do you understand?

Go.

Matt,

It's all right.

I'm all right.

Matt, where
did you take Tom?

It's too late.

He won.

It will be light soon.

Do you think I'll
be able to see the sun

one last time?

You were right.

It's always daytime
in my dreams.

Tom, you okay?

I thought I was
gonna die in here.

You're not gonna die today,
remember? I promised you.

Lucky thing
no safety locks, huh?

Your brother is in here
somewhere

and he wants to kill you.

He has to kill you.

It's the only way he can get
his full power back.

That's absurd. He could have
killed me the whole time.

No, he can't do it himself.

He has to find someone else
to do it for him,

which means we have to kill
everyone we see,

no matter who it is.

Get us out of here.

I think your brother's probably
gonna be by the exit.

Do you remember that little
room with the escape hatch?

He won't know about that.

Is that him?

Yeah.

Who are you?

You're never gonna
get your brother.

Run!

Hey!

Shoot him!

No no no!

I don't know what you had
planned, Vlad Kossei,

but it didn't work.

He wasn't
your brother anymore.

We were holding this one
captive.

He must have freed himself.

It means
the others are dead.

Derek, Carrie was right.

She couldn't hold
a vampire captive.

Where did she go?

You've been hit.

Tom, no.

God help me.

Come on, stay awake.

That's my truck.
I'm gonna go get help.

Don't give up on me now,
okay?

Where's Keaton?
Have you seen our vampire?

He's dead.
What?

Calm down.
He's dead.

So is Vlad Kossei.

Vlad Kossei isn't dead.

Where did she go?

Don't be afraid.

Where did she go?

To the brother.

I think his name is Tom.

Damn!

I killed Vlad Kossei
myself.

Both brothers were in
Transylvania.

One of them injured himself
on the bones on the altar.

It wasn't the architect.

That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

It was the photographer,
his brother.

He managed to hide
the other brother

and secretly bring him here.

We wanted to join the other
vampires

as soon as it was safe.

I'm one of the vampires

who was supposed to stop
Vlad Kossei.

Do you understand?

We saw that you
contacted him.

We couldn't trust anyone.

Wait here.

He played us all
against each other.

We're just marionettes.

He needed me
to kill his brother.

That's all he wanted.

Tom knew he'd be here today.

Too late.

Something's painted
on the wall.

Yeah, I know.

He can't be far.

What are you thinking?

Derek, go home.

Try and get yourself
a life,

a real life.

Hey, I thought that
Vlad Kossei is invulnerable

now that his brother's dead.

Invulnerable or not,

I'm gonna get
that bastard.
