<i>This is the formation zone</i>

<i>for tropical storm Hazel.
Now, we've got two models.</i>

<i>The American model
has Hazel turning north,</i>

<i>over Mobile
and the Florida Panhandle</i>

<i>and into Georgia.</i>

<i>The European model</i>

<i>has her slowing down, heading
northwest,</i>

<i>gaining strength and becoming
a potential hurricane.</i>

<i>This could become a major storm
and hit land again anywhere</i>

<i>from Gulfport to New Orleans.</i>

<i>Hazel is moving at
approximately</i>

<i>ten miles per hour</i>

<i>and should make landfall
late tonight</i>

<i>or early tomorrow morning.</i>

<i>As Hazel makes landfall,
she's gonna become</i>

<i>a tropical storm once again
and bring plenty of rain</i>

<i>and high winds
to wherever she hits.</i>

<i>Now, folks, I feel that Hazel
is most likely to head towards</i>

<i>our friends in Louisiana.</i>

[seagulls crying]

Gorgeous.

What's in there?

In that?
Yeah.

Nothing.
Define nothing.

Soft shells.

I thought the molt was over.
It was. And then it wasn't.

But those are for Fryman's.

What, so they can be drowned
in garlic and black pepper?

You can't even taste them!

They offered 55 a dozen.

I'll give you 60.

Tucker gonna be okay with that?

Are you kidding?
He'll be thrilled.

Soft-shells this late?

If anyone asks,
you didn't get those from me.

Get what?
[Sang chuckles]

Careful out there this weekend.
Thanks.

[indistinct chatter]

Thank you.

Seventeen?
Seventeen right here.

Hi, this is Miranda Wells again.

I got an overdraft fee
of $80 on the third.

But if the check had gone
through like it was supposed to,

everything would've been fine.

So, that fee
needs to be removed,

refunded, rescinded or whatever.

Please call back me today,
if possible.

Thank you.

Miranda, it's 12:13.
So?

So you told me
to remind you about

a dentist appointment at noon.
I forgot.

[sighs]
[indistinct chatter]

[Tucker] Hey!
Hey.

from last year.

Yeah?
Yeah.

People are spending again,
thank God.

Where are you off to?
Uh, a dentist appointment.

Oh, listen, um,

about dinner.
Oh, I know. With the storm.

It's okay.
Yeah.

The weather guy
says it's gonna miss us, but...

You can never be too careful.
So you think I should?

What? Board up?
Absolutely.

Look, no matter
how bad things are,

they can always get worse.
Oh.

And here I actually got us
in to Shaya.

Oh, babe. It's a school night.

Thank you.

We're fine.

Oh! And, um...

I bought soft-shells from Sang,

who was going to sell them
to Fryman's,

which I said was bogus,
because their chef sucks,

which is why I paid 60 a dozen.

Soft shells this late
in the season?

Right?
That's my girl.

Bye.

[man] Thank you.
[woman] Thank you.

Hi. Sorry.
Can I help you?

Well, I hope so.

I made a reservation
on Hotel Tonight.

I've got a cousin in Nashville.

Oh, is that so?

Is this your first time
staying with us?

Uh, first time in New Orleans.

What are you studying?

How to get out
from behind this desk.

Well, anything is possible
if you really want it.

Yeah, I guess.

Any chance you have a room
with a view?

No, sorry.

All of the rooms overlooking
the Quarter are fully booked.

No problem.
I'll take whatever I can get.

Room 1 checked out early,
on account of the storm.

Okay, that's so weird.

Room 1 has a view
all the way to the river.

Must be my lucky day.

[Miranda groans]

a grown up in here

with a cavity this bad.

What do you do,
gargle with sugar?


[mumbling] Saltwater taffy.
Yep, that would do it.

Devon says I need a root canal.

Well, I think he just misses
your company.

Mm, how about a week
from Monday at 9:00?

Donna, you're not helping.
Don't you have anything, like...

next June?

Who's your provider again?

I opted out.

Um, why?
How much is it out of pocket?

That's 1,700 for a front,
2,300 for a back.

Is it a front or a back?
Uh, back.

Well, I'm sure Tucker
wouldn't mind plunking down

that platinum card of his.

That may be so,
but things are...

complicated enough what
with him being my boss and all.

Look, just stay safe tonight.
Okay? I hear Hazel's gonna turn.

I bet she hangs a left
and pounds us straight on.

[birds chirping]

[knocking on door]



I, uh...
I'm looking for Miranda Wells.

You from the bank?

Can't say that I am. No.

She's at work right now.

You can leave it with me.
I'm her son.

I kinda figured that.

Well, the thing is...

I'm afraid this comes with
a little bit of an explanation.

Any idea what time
she'll be home?

Usually around four.

That's a cool thing
you've got there.

My dad made it for me,
'cause I wasn't getting my line

to where the big ones
are hiding.

He was an inventor.
Sort of.

Pretty good one, I bet.

Well, my mom says
he never sold much,

but that's 'cause
it wasn't his real job.

But he sure solved
your casting problem, didn't he?

Fish don't seem too impressed.

No school today?
I have a cold,

but my mom gave me
purple Dimetapp, so it's okay.

Well, you chose a beautiful day
to stay home.

Yeah. The storm's not supposed
to hit us until tonight.

I checked.
A couple times.

Thanks for the help.

Oh, and when you see her,
don't tell her we spoke.

I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

Your secret's safe with me.

[reporter over radio]
<i>There is a chance that Hazel</i>

<i>will become a hurricane
before it makes landfall</i>

<i>somewhere between Pensacola
and Morgan City, Louisiana.</i>

<i>Even if Hazel never develops
into a hurricane,</i>

<i>she will be bringing high winds
and tons of rain</i>

<i>to the Gulf Coast.</i>
Great.

[reporter ] <i>Hurricane warnings
are off the...</i>


[phone rings]

Hi.

[Bobby] <i>Miranda, it's Bobby.</i>
I know. I have Caller ID,

and I can see your face,
sort of.

<i>Well, are you listening
to the news?</i>

About the storm?
No. What?

get worse with climate change.</i>

I blame cows.
[scoffs]

<i>How is your roof?</i>
My roof?

<i>The leaks.
Did you get 'em fixed?</i>

Bobby,
I can't afford a root canal,

let alone a new roof.

<i>You need to sell that damn
place</i>

<i>and move to higher ground.</i>

So you've said.
<i>Oh, did I?</i>

Ever since he died.

<i>And it's as true today
as it was then.</i>

<i>It is not safe.</i>
[bell ringing]

[kids shouting]

Look, Bobby, um, I gotta run.

I'll call you later?
[Bobby] <i>Well, you never do.</i>

<i>You're always so busy.</i>

It's busy with the kids.
Love you.

Hey, gang.
How was the day?

Awful.

Terrible.

Bessie, honey, what's wrong?

She told some kid
she has a pony.

They called her a liar,
which she is.

I said I wanted a pony.

Since when?

Since always!

I told you not to let
her watch <i>Black Stallion.</i>

You didn't eat your lunch?

Nobody brown bags anymore.

Why can't I just buy food
at school?

You can every once in a while,
but it adds up.

We've been over this.
So stupid.

Okay. Talk to me.
What's going on? Hmm?


Kit Riley's having a party
the same night as me.

They're gonna have freaking
food trucks.

Wow.

I don't even want a birthday.
I'm never gonna get

what I want anyway,
so what's the point?

Okay. We can't afford
a computer right now,

but it might be something
for Christmas.

Right.
We'll be lucky to have a tree.

[phone rings]

You're not supposed to be
on the phone while...

I wasn't gonna answer it,
I just wanna see who it was.

I'm expecting a call
from the bank.

It says Carol.

That's the bank.
[Missy] Oh, my God.

You're on a first name basis
with the bank?

Stop being so dramatic.
This is why I don't want

a party, we can't afford it!
Ask if I can call her back.

Please?
[crashing]

Oh, my God, Mom!

You're, like, the worst driver
in the whole world.

That's because no one else
in the entire world

has you as a passenger.

I am so sorry.
It was totally my fault.

Are you okay?
Are your kids okay?

Other than needing
an attitude adjustment,

they're fine.

Well, looks like
you got the brunt of it.


There goes my deductible.

Hey, hey.

Don't waste your insurance
on this.

If you just have a little
duct tape and spray foam,

I can fix this.

I can't ask you to do that.

You didn't. I offered.

My dad was a mechanic.

Hey. Whatever you want.
Totally up to you.

Well... I mean,
we're just up the road.

I'll follow you.

Thanks.

I got it. I got it.

He's not gonna sue us, is he?
Nope.

Why is he taking our bumper?

Because he's offered
to come over to fix it.

You're letting him
follow us home?

don't forget your backpack.


You know, I realize I never got
a chance to introduce myself.

Bray Johnson.
Miranda Wells.

Miranda, nice to meet you.
Yeah. No, not really,

but I appreciate the gesture.

This is Missy and Bessie.

Hi, guys.
What's the "V" stand for?

The "V"?
Oh, uh, Vanderbilt.

I teach engineering up there.

Cool.

your hands full, huh?

Oh, you have no idea.
And that's Greg.

Hi, honey.
Hey, Greg.

Hey. Uh, Mom?
What happened to the bumper?

Karma.

But Mr. Johnson here
says he can fix it.

Yeah, you wouldn't happen
to have a few screwdrivers

and some wrenches
in your tool shed, would you?

Of course.
And how about some spray foam?

You know, the kind you use
to fill a hole or stop a leak?

Tiger Foam or Great Stuff?

Either will do.

Tiger what or Great what?

Shop talk.

Do you want a beer
or a water or a juice box?

Nah, this'll just take a second.

Okay, well,
I'll leave my door open.

If you need anything,
just holler.

[thunder rumbling]

[Greg and Bray
speaking indistinctly]

Hey, Mom.
Check it out.

There. See? The last honest man.

Now, can you turn on
the Weather Channel

and set the table?

and Morgan City, Louisiana.</i>

<i>So, hurricane warnings
are up as Hazel becomes</i>

<i>a Category 1 hurricane
later tonight</i>

<i>or early tomorrow morning,
coming onshore somewhere there</i>

<i>between Mobile, New Orleans,
and Pensacola...</i>

Bessie?
Let's not color on the table.

Okay? And can you please
take out the garbage?

Okay, Mommy.

[indistinct chatter on TV]

What's for dinner?
Wait. Let me guess.

Red beans and rice
or microwaved chicken nuggets

and a salad.

What would you prefer?
Lobster tails?

Wouldn't you?

I want pizza.
Not tonight, honey.

Missy? Come here.

Greg is in geek heaven.

What do you expect? The poor kid
is surrounded by girls.

How much are you paying
this guy anyway?

Nothing.

You gotta admit. You coming
out here looking for her,

then she runs into you?
That's pretty weird.

Is it?
Yeah.

Because, you know,
what are the odds?

Or maybe she's just
a lousy driver.

[thunder rumbling]
[rain pattering]

Uh-oh. Here comes Hazel.

Hey, how's it going?

Well, it's good,
if you let this dry.

It'll outlast the apocalypse.

Okay, why don't you come inside,
wash your hands?

Much obliged.

Greg, come on!

I don't want you
missing anymore school.

Uh, you'll have
to excuse the mess.

I wasn't expecting company
as you can probably tell.

The paper towels and dish soap
are right there.

And the beer in the fridge
has your name on it.

Oh, thank you.
Mom, Bray's a professor.

I heard.
Uh, what brings you down here?

Well, it's, uh...

kind of a long story, actually.

Oh. I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

No, no,
I don't mean it like that.


[groans] Mom!
What?

You put the chicken
in the microwave

still in the bag,
and now it's all melted.

Yes, I sure did.

I guess it is red beans tonight.

Pizza!
[Greg] Yeah!

Guys, that's not gonna happen.
Poor people can't afford pizza.

We're not poor. We're broke.
There's a difference.

You were saying?

[heavy rain pattering]

One second.

Guys?

Nice, huh?
It's our little version

of <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>
With pots.

[rain dripping into pots]

[wind howling]

Wind scares me.

Well, nature can be
very powerful,

but so are you.
Me? No way.

Oh, yes, you are.

But we have to be careful...

because we get what we expect.

Mommy? Is that true?
What, honey?

What do you call this?

A crab riding a bike?

What else?

A magnet.

Which attracts things

with a force
that you cannot see,

but is definitely real.

Your thoughts work the same way.

The more you think
about something,

the more you draw it to you.

Okay. So, this is me
thinking about pizza.

Are you really being serious
right now?

I like when the cheese
is all melted and gooey.

Mm. And what about you?

Pepperoni and sausage.
Oh. And stuffed crust.

That's what makes it.
[laughter]

[knocking at door]

Okay. I've got a medium cheese
and medium pepperoni

with stuffed crust
for Miranda Wells.

Did you do this?

Don't look at me.

You got the right name,
but we did not order those.

A guy named Tucker called it in.

He even left a tip
'cause of the storm.

Thank you.

[man] Stay dry.
You too.

Thanks.

[car engine revs]
[Miranda clears throat]

Okay, girls.

Wash your hands.
[Bessie] Okay, Mom.

How cool is that?

Well, um,
I think I should be going.

Oh, yeah. No.

Of course. Sorry.

Thank you.

You smashed his truck.

Ask him to stay.

Tucker is hardcore buying
my love right now

and it is so working.

His family owns a restaurant
on the water.

Middendorf's.
And I run it.

And him too, I guess.
Ah.

She doesn't like to call him
a boyfriend because he's 43.

Eat your pizza.

He sounds like a kind man
who recognizes a good person.

Are you, like,
a Buddhist or something?

Missy,
what kind of question is that?

I don't know.
You just seem different.

Unlike Mom.
Always stressed.

I'm not always stressed.
You so are!

Bessie,
will you back me up here?

Am I always stressed?

Yes.
Traitor.

You're exhausted the minute
you wake up.

Okay. All right.
I see how it goes.

Everybody gang up on Mom,
who works all day

and has friends like Tucker.
And if it wasn't for her,

you guys would all be
eating microwaved plastic.

Yeah. What he said. Cheers.
Cheers.

You guys are funny.

Okay. Homework time.

Dishes in the sink.
I should be going.

And, no. I'm not a Buddhist.

I just...
I'm open to the possibility

that whatever happens,
even the bad stuff,

can lead to better things.

Not in this house.

[rain pouring]

Oh! Leave it to a hurricane

to ruin a perfectly
good evening.

You're not driving back
to Nashville tonight, are you?

No. Not tonight.
No. I got a place downtown.

But, uh, listen.

About today.
I just wanna say that everything

was... I don't know,
really unexpected.


Yeah.
I never thought I'd say this,

but it was a pleasure
running into you.

[chuckles]
You have quite a family.

Thanks.

They're good kids.

I meant to say
something earlier,

but the timing just...
[Bessie screams]

[Bessie] <i>Mom! Spider!</i>
[Greg] <i>I wanna see!</i>

And, uh, back to my life.

[Missy screams]
<i>Mom, here. Please.</i>

Good night.
Good night.

[indistinct chatter]

[wind howling]

[weathercaster over TV]
<i>This is a triple-threat storm</i>

<i>as it heads in.
And it looks like</i>

<i>it's gonna make landfall
probably late tonight</i>

<i>or early tomorrow morning.</i>

<i>As you can see,
the satellite shows it</i>

<i>has a very
circular presentation,</i>

<i>indicative of a healthy storm.</i>

<i>The good news is,
as Hazel makes landfall,</i>

<i>she should become
a tropical storm once again,</i>

<i>with sustained winds
of 50 to 70 miles an hour,</i>

<i>and could miss Louisiana
altogether.</i>

Yeah, right.
[phone ringing]

when the storm actually hits?</i>

have a large amount of rain.</i>

<i>But it will be the wind that
will cause the most damage.</i>

<i>Historically,
wind causes the most damage</i>

<i>in this type of storm,
toppling trees</i>

<i>and downing powerlines...</i>
[TV turns off]

[glass shatters]
[Miranda gasps]

[wind howling]

Oh, my God.

We're just gonna go
into the bathroom, okay?

Hurry up. Why don't you guys
hop in the tub? It's safe.

in the bathtub?

Remember when Daddy

would take us camping and we
all huddled together

like an adventure?
[rumbling]

[kids scream]

[rumbling and creaking]


Watch your feet.
Watch your feet.

Mom, are you okay?

Trying to be.

What are we gonna do?

If the cereal is dry,
grab a bowl and eat something

before the milk goes bad.

But why does this
always happen to us?

We're unlucky, I guess.

Come on.
Let's get you some Cheerios.

One, two, three!

Good girl.

Huh.

Are you all okay?


I swear.

My whole life
is like that gut feeling

that something really bad
is going to happen,

and then...

it does.

Coffee?

Thanks.

What are you doing here?

Well, I couldn't very well
leave without knowing

you all were all right.

Do you have
homeowner's insurance?

You mean the only one
I could afford,

with the $5,000 deductible?
Story of my life.

You know,
things don't have to be a series

of unfortunate events.

Well, it sure as hell
feels that way.

I know, but...

I've found that when I think
about what I want

instead of what I don't want
my life is just so much better.

You're one of those people
who wakes up happy, aren't you?

Let me help.
How?

With more magic foam?

I just renovated this nice
little Tennessee farmhouse.

This won't be a problem.
It'll just take time and...

And money.
Both of which I... I don't have.

Not as much as you think.

Yeah.

Look, with the price of lumber
being what it is,

we might have to improvise
a little.

But the main goal is to get you
back into a dry house. Yeah?

Yeah,
that would be a good start.

Let's say $500.
Five hundred?

Materials.

A roof costs, like, 10,000.

Like I said, we might have
to improvise a little.

But I've got all the tools
in the truck

and I don't have to be back
at class for a week.

Why are you helping me?

Because I can.

Okay.

You're hired.

But only 'cause you
brought me coffee.

Thank you.

Oh, honey. No, no, no.

Don't throw those away.
They're wet.

but they'll dry.

And these are the most
important things in the house.



Missy's right.

I said I had a pony
when I didn't.


this is a pony,
and you have this, right?

Mom?

What are we gonna do
about my party?

It's in five days.

We'll figure it out.
How?

Look at this place.

I think we should cancel.

No.

No.

No.

I know you think that parents
have all the answers,

but we don't.
Not by the longest shot,

but you know what?
You only turn 16 once.

And we're gonna have a party.

Where'd you get the coffee?

So, it looks like
these two rafters are split.

Otherwise, it's a clean hole.

Meaning what, exactly?

Hey, Bray.
Hey, guys.

So, to re-skin this section,
I don't know.

It'll be about 150.
And then the two-by-ten's,

a roll of tar paper, some nails,
you're still less than 200.

And sheet-rocking the ceiling
and re-insulating.

Maybe another 200?

What's he doing here?

He's fixing the roof.
How? We're broke, remember?

I don't know.

Magnets.

[car horn honking]

Oh, look! Nana's here.


Oh!

Oh, my Lord!
Is everybody okay?

Anybody get hurt?
We slept in a bathtub!

You slept in the bathtub?

There's a hole in the roof.
Oh, that is so scary.

I have been trying
to call you all night.

Well, cell towers
must have been down.

Mom was so cool.
She didn't panic or nothing.

She didn't panic or "anything."

Look at this mess.

What did I tell you
about that house?

And now... Who is that?

Oh, that's Bray.

He's gonna fix the roof.

Just like he fixed Mom's bumper.

He had pizza with us.

What pizza?
[Miranda] Stuffed crust.

Yes. Bray is going to try
to fix the roof.

Bray?
Is he licensed?

He's from Tennessee.

Can you say hello
to my mother-in-law, Bobby?

Bobby, Bray.
Bobby, Bray.

Nice to meet you.
Uh-huh. And you.

Mom smashed into him
with the van.

I didn't smash into him.
I tapped his bumper.

And yours fell off.
[laughter]

What's the verdict?

I'm gonna swing by the lumber
yard, pick up some materials.

Also see if I can snag a blower
or two

and get those floors dry.

Well, we'll be here.

Oh, no, you won't.
These children can't stay here.

Why not?
Their bedrooms are dry.

Honey, I have two words for you,
black mold.

And Greg is sick already
as it is.

Well, what about school?
The power's out,

and the radio said they're
closed today and tomorrow.


Why not spend a few nights
with me

and just maybe
come up with a plan?

Sure. You're right.

Why don't you guys go pack up
some clothes?

We're gonna go to Nana's.

Two minutes, you have.
Don't pack everything.


Thank you.
Thank you, honey.

Um, do you think we could stop
by the restaurant

on the way out?
I wanna check on Tuck.

Who is this complete stranger

that you are trusting
your home with?

Not everyone
is a serial killer, Bobby.

I mean, he's a college
professor for goodness sake.

Well, you can't be too careful
these days.

The only thing of value
in that house are the kids,

and they're coming with us.

So, I'm just gonna believe
that he's not gonna screw us

and he's gonna do the best job
he can.

Have you met people lately?

So, we'll get out
of your hair then.

She seems worried about you.

Well, we're all used to playing
defense around here.

But I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

What am I trying to do?
Give us hope.

But I am trying to raise
my kids to be realistic.

Their father was a dreamer,
and apparently that's genetic,

especially with Greg.

And I just want to keep
their feet

firmly planted on the ground.

Roger that.
And your next question

is about my husband,
but you're too polite to ask.

He died
just over five years ago.

I'm sorry, truly.

Me too.
He's really missing out.

We should exchange our numbers,
right?


Oh, Tuck.

Nice, huh?

It's a good thing
we boarded it up.

But we're all right.

How is everyone?
Uh, fine.

We had some damage to our roof,

but I have someone
working on it.

And we're gonna head
to Bobby's for a few days.

You all could have stayed
with me.

Do you wanna tell her that?

Hell no.
She'd never forgive me.

And I'm trying to stay
on her good side.

Who's doing your roof?

Oh, just a guy.
You don't know him.

Okay.
So, I'm gonna get them settled,

and I'll borrow her car,
and I'll come back and help you.

No. You take care
of business.

I'll call you later.
Really?

Are you sure?
Yeah.

Okay.
See you, Bob!

Has Tucker lost weight?
He looks good.

Uh, nope. I don't think so.

Any developments
I should know about?

Why rock the boat?
Cause he's a good man.

I know that's a strange thing
for a mother-in-law to say,

but I also know that, you know,
it can be hard to move on.

I'm a widow, too, remember?

I just don't see the point
in forcing something

that neither one of us
needs or wants.

[blower whirring]


Thank you.

[clerk] Hi. Hello.
Hi, I'm Bray Johnson.

Is that his?
Is that that guy's?

Excuse me. Is that yours?
Oh, my God.

Hey, I'm Matt Wells.
Bray Johnson. How you doing?

a drink or something?</i>


if I could put pressure at six,
six point zero, six three...

Gentlemen, this is Matt,

the inventor
I was talking about.

[phone ringing]

Hey, I've been meaning
to call you.


Did you survive big bad Hazel?
[Bray] <i>Uh, yes and no.</i>

I might have to stick around
a few more days.

Do you mind?

Not at all.
So, what happened?

Huh, I'm not quite sure.

I think the universe
is trying to tell me something.

What did she say
when you gave it to her?

Well, that's the thing. I, uh...

I haven't told her yet.

Well, why the hell not?

That is what I am trying
to figure out.

Where are all the kids?

Well, we're mostly grown-ups
here who've retired.

So, where are they?

They're just sitting
in their houses,

watching <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

It may not look it, but this is
a very active community.

We got golf and swimming
and yoga and...

We just like to keep things
nice and neat and safe and...

Oh, my gosh!
We got a pond and a gazebo.

What's a gazebo do?

Just looks pretty.

It's where old people sit
and complain about their knees

and stuff.
Missy.

What? You said it.
[Bobby] Let's just go in.

[chainsaw whirring]

That is a big hole!

Sorry, what?


You the roof guy?

Today I am.
Name's Bray.

Tuck Middendorf.
I own the place on the water.

Miranda wanted me to check in.

Uh, you're the one
who sent the pizza.

Yeah. How did you...
[Bray] You scored a bunch

of points there, my friend.

Oh, yeah?

How do you know Miranda?

Oh, well, I don't, really.

Why are you fixing her roof?

That's a very good question.

Hey, could you, uh, grab me
that parachute bag there?

Yeah.
No, that one, yeah.

You can throw it on up here.

There you go.

[Bray] Do you want a hand?
Yeah.

Thanks.

Heck of a view up here.

that's why guys do roofs.

Oh, yeah, this whole section's
gonna have to be replaced.

and re-paper tomorrow.

Forecast says there's no rain
coming, so it's all good.

But you're not licensed.
No, no.

I'm just lending a hand.

Well, I wish Miranda had
checked with me.

I would have paid to hire
a real roofer.

No offense.

None taken.

She's stubborn that way.

How long have you two
been together?

Oh, a few years.

She came to work for me about
a year after her husband died.

Good guy too,
from what I hear.

That must have been really
painful.

Widowed. Three kids.

I think it's made her more
cautious.

I'm the same way.

Why I haven't
pushed things farther.

You know?

Well, things can change
if you want them to.

I just want her to be happy.

Can't say I blame you.

What I want...
Nice meeting you, Bray.

Oh, yeah. You too, Tucker.

Give me a shout if this
gets to be too much.




Why do people like puzzles?

They don't.

They just need something
to do when they're bored.

Oh! You make this sound
like prison.

Look at all these pieces.

This is gonna take us a week.
[Missy] Forever.

Now, look.
I know you love that house.

But I think we...
Can we not do this right now?

I was in real estate
for 40 years.

That place could sell in a day.

Or it could take a year
and a half.

You don't have that kind
of time.

to think about right now.

Well, that's all I'm asking
is, you know,

that you think about it.

I mean, y'all
on top of each other.

Those girls
need another bedroom.

You could get your money out
and then some.

Not with a hole in the roof.

Oh, honey, you and I both know
that that house is a tear-down.

[phone ringing]

[Miranda] <i>Hi.</i>
Hey! Hey.

I thought you might like
a status update.

Only if it's good news.

Well, I ran out of daylight,
but once the power comes back on

I should be done
the day after tomorrow.

That's fantastic.
[Bray] <i>I got rid of that limb,</i>

<i>I did a little triage
on the hole.</i>

The floors seem fine,
but I'll still run the blower

all night just to make sure.
[Miranda] <i>I don't care</i>

<i>about that just as long
as we're dry.</i>

All right. Well,
I'll check back in tomorrow.

Wait, Bray.

Where are you?

What are you doing right now?

I'm sitting on your roof,
taking in this gorgeous sunset.

You?

Stressing.

Is it about the money?

No. It's everything. I...

My job, kids, Tucker.

I think I might actually have
to sell the house.

Ooh, that's a big one.

No kidding. I just know
somebody's going to scoop it up

and tear it down.
And it just breaks my heart.

Look. When the time is right,
you'll know what to do.

Is that another one
of your life lessons?

I went through a divorce
ten years ago.

It really knocked me on my ass.

Were there kids?

No, no.

We wanted to save up
a little money

before starting a family
and it turns out

she started one
with somebody else.

Oh, my God.
That...

You must have been...

Devastated. Yeah.

And then I got angry
and started blaming

everything on everybody else.

That doesn't sound like you.

Not anymore.
That was before.


Before another kind
of wake-up call.

Well... I didn't mean to pry.

No, no, no, no, you didn't.

It's just that sometimes
the best thing to do is...

wait till everything
becomes clear.

Well, that's great news
about the house, Professor.

Thank you.

You're welcome.
And have a good evening.

[Miranda] <i>Good night.</i>
Good night.


Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
Good morning, Sloane.

I heard you extended your stay.

Yeah, I'm just trying to make
myself useful

to a friend up in Madisonville.

Which reminds me, I'm expecting
a pretty important package

in the next few days.

Could you keep your eyes
open for it?

Important package. You got it.
Thanks.

over like that,

'cause you won't spill anything.

Oh! Bobby.
What are you doing here?

We're helping Mommy.

Northshore Food Bank
put out a call,

and Miranda thought
you might be able to help.

There are a lot of people
on this side of the lake

without power.
I didn't think you'd mind

putting all this to good use.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

But I could have asked Manny
or Charmaine to help.

You didn't have to come in.
Oh, well, it is a workday.

Well, maybe
she just missed you.

You ever think of that?
You did?

What?

Oh, uh, nothing.

So, after we drop this off,
we're gonna skedaddle.

I'll call you later.

You know, I thought I might
show Miranda

that new housing development
out by me.

You know, 'cause she's thinking
about selling her place.

You are?
No.

I checked Zillow this morning.
Lots of listings.

But after this storm,
yours is gonna stand out.

I'm just saying is all.

If we move, how will Santa know
where to find us?


When you move,
Mommy will fill out a change

of address card.

And the post office
will send that

straight to the North Pole.

What's wrong with our house?

Oh, everything, sweetheart.

Bobby?


I gotta go. Payroll doesn't stop
just 'cause the power's out.

I'll call you later.
Okay. Thank you.

<i>â™ª It's so strange... â™ª</i>

Let's go easy on that pepper.
That will give you the sneezes.

<i>â™ª When everything

<i>â™ª And I'm broken inside â™ª</i>

Whoa.

Ladies first.

And the gentleman.

Uh, Nana? Do you have any
Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

Now, that is protein.
That is good for muscles.

We usually just have cereal.

Fresh out of cereal.
I'm sorry, honey.

This bread tastes gross.

Well, that's because
it's gluten-free.

And when you get to be my age,
you'll thank me.

What's gluten?

It's... That's a thing in food.

[phone beeps]

Mm! "Hi, gang. The power's back
on at the house,

and the roof is fixed."

Yes.
Yes.

Oh, no, already?

Whoa, cool!
A skylight.

It's actually kinda legit.

Whoa! Pretty cool!
How'd you get that up there?

Pretty impressive.

What exactly is that thing
on the roof?

Um, weather-proof Band-Aid.

Where'd it come from?
It just appeared.

Like the pizza?
No. No, no.

That was because of Tucker,
and this is because Bray

worked really, really hard
to find something that'd fit.

It was probably floating
around in the bayou

waiting to be useful.
And then it found me.

Or it was just a coincidence.

Um, "coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous."

Who said that?

Einstein.

E equals MC squared guy?

He also said that every person
should ask themselves,

"Is this a friendly universe?"

Why?

Well, because your answer
determines your life.

Are you sure
you're not from California?

No, ma'am.

So, you're saying the magnet
in your head

connected you to that piece
of fiberglass...

Okay, gang.
That's enough questions.

This man has a life.
Say goodbye to Bray.

Bye. Thank you for the roof.
Bye, Bray.

Um, let me get my checkbook.

Okay.

Let's go to my room.
Okay, baby.

Could I ask you a question?

Shoot.
What happened to the envelope?

I haven't given it to her yet.

Why not?

Well, I put it in the mailbox
after the pizza,

but it flew away.

So, I had to get a new one.

What's in it?

Grown-up stuff.

But definitely something good.

Here you go.

Five hundred very
grateful dollars.

Just do me a favor and don't
cash it until next week.

Understood.

So, you're off to Nashville?

Yeah.

I pretty much got my hands
full until winter break.

I still don't understand why
you helped us.

I think you and I collided
for a reason.

And who's to say?
Maybe we helped each other.


Honey? It's Tuck.

Oh! Will you tell him
I'll call him back?


Excuse me.

Hi. Um, can I call you back
in, like, two minutes?

and the kids want to come</i>

<i>to the opening tonight?</i>
[Miranda] Okay.

wants to come too.</i>

Sure. Let me check.

Tucker wants to take us all out
for the re-opening.

Um, and he wants to know
if you wanna come.

I wouldn't miss it.

Great. We'll see you at seven.
[Tucker] <i>All right. Great.</i>

<i>See you tonight.</i>
Okay. Bye.

So, you were saying?

Something about us
colliding for a reason?

Yeah. Well, maybe it was just
a chance for me

to meet a really cool woman.

You're doing a hell of a job
raising three kids on your own.

Thank you.

Although, I think I got
the better end of the deal.

Oh, hey, listen, I still have
the chainsaw for another day

if you want me to free up
your van.

I can swing by
on my way out tomorrow.

I could use the firewood.

By all means.
Oh, honey.

Tucker can do it.

Tucker with a chainsaw?

Okay.

Um, but I'm making the coffee.

Deal.

[indistinct chatter]
[tapping glass]

Everybody?
If I could have your attention?

Um, I'd like to take this
opportunity

and thank Manny
and all of his peeps

for working their butts off
to get this place

up and running again.

[applause]
Manny!

Every now and then a storm
comes along

and it not only rattles
your business,

but it rattles your life
and the choices you've made

in that life.

I, uh...
I've always wanted a family.

For whatever reason,
it just wasn't in the cards.

You know, maybe I... I focused
too much on the business.

But, uh...

I would like to change that
right here and right now.


Miranda Wells,
will you marry me?

Yeah.
Yes!

All right.

Here we go.

Oh, sorry.

You know what?
Let's just put it...

We'll fix that later.

Whatever!
She said yes!


Thank you.

Thank you.

Woo!

I love that.
[Bobby] I'm so excited.

Okay.
[Tucker] All right.

Hey. What happened to your van?

Oh, it's still stuck
behind a tree.

But not to worry. Her handyman
is gonna chop it up

first thing in the morning.

My handyman?

Hey. Why don't I spend
the night at the house

so you two lovebirds
can celebrate your engagement?

Yeah. That would be terrific.

Yeah. Um,

you guys don't mind
if Nana stays over? Right?

Yeah. Sure.
Yup.

I'll see you in the morning.

Hey. I'm gonna talk to Doug
for one second.

Kids, do not stay up
all night long.

Hey, Doug!

Congratulations, Mom.
[woman] Congrats, Tucker...

Thank you.

the car.

Goodnight, sweetie.

[car doors close]

All right. Here we go.
Keep them closed.

I got you. I got you.

Keep them closed.
Okay.

Almost there.

And...

open.

[Tucker chuckles]

I spoke to Doug.

I told him I wanted it here
first thing this morning.

And boom. Here it is.

Tucker?
I cannot have my fiancÃ©e

driving around
in some old minivan.

What will the neighbors think?

Huh!

Wow.

It's beautiful. Thank you.

You like it?

It's not, uh, too small?
[car beeps]

Like the ring?

I just need to get that sized.

Well, let's go do that
right now.

I can't, babe. I have to run
errands before work.

What errands?

I have to get it together
before Missy's party.

Party?
Her 16th birthday, silly.

She talked about it last night.

Right. Yeah. Sorry,
I was a little distracted.

Well, she's worried all of her
friends are going

to another party
that has food trucks.

Well, I can get a food truck.

No. She doesn't need
a food truck.

She needs balloons and a cake.

Well, what should I get her?

Oh, nothing. Just a card.

That says what?

[chainsaw whirring]


about it.

Which part?
What do you mean?

Which part do you not wanna
talk about?

The reason you're pissed or
that thing you just threw away?

Both.

Okay.

You wanna talk about
the third thing?

What third thing?

Well, my guess is the reason
you're upset

has nothing to do
with that thing you threw away.

How would you know that?

Word is your mom got engaged.

Yeah.

Which I imagine stirs up
a whole boatload of feelings

about your dad.

Yeah.

Which I suspect
you just took out on...

whatever it is that was in that
box you just threw away.

Maybe. Yeah.

Did it deserve it?

It was just a stupid invention.

You mind showing me?

<i>It's supposed to be
an automatic chicken feeder</i>

for science class.
If it worked,

I could sell it,
and we could make some money,

so Mom wouldn't have
to marry Tucker.

And why would you say that?

She doesn't love him.
You sure about that?

Not like Dad.

All right. Here's the thing.

I think if you took a couple
links out here.

Right.

There. And then...

you increase the tension here.

That should work.

[machine whirring]

It works.

You still wanna throw it out?
No way!

Let me tell you something.

All your dad ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

How would you know that?

Well, because dad's
are like that.

Why are you so nice to us?

You get what you give.

See?
That's not true.

Not when you're 15.

Ah, come on. I think you're
selling yourself short.

Kit Riley's having her party
tomorrow, same day as mine.

And she's having food trucks,

and she's the most popular girl
in school.

Okay. Let me ask you
a question.

What would you rather have?

Two hundred Instagram friends
or five real ones?

Five real.

And are they coming here
tomorrow?

Yep.
Okay. Then focus on having

a good time with them.

Doing what?
I don't know.

What would make you happy?
Not your friends, you.

Wait. If you don't know
what you want,

how can you ask for it?

Taffy.

Hmm?

We used to make taffy
when I was a kid.

All of us.
Mom loves taffy.

Well, there you go.

And now that you've got all
this firewood,

you could, uh, maybe have
a bonfire down by the water,

roast some hot dogs,
make S'mores.

How do you know about S'mores?

You don't get this old
without living.

[car approaching]

Mom? What the heck?

Tucker.

Wow. That's lot of firewood.

I hear congratulations
are in order.

Imagine my surprise.

Mom? Can we make taffy?

Taffy?
Tomorrow. For my party.

There may only be six of us,
but who cares?

And you're totally coming,
right? You have to.

Well, I don't...
Mom? Tell him he has to.

I don't know
what we're talking about.

You better be there.

What did you do?

No clue.

Yeah, right.

[Miranda chuckles]

Well, I'm just going
to finish cleaning up

and, uh,
I will get out of your hair.

Bray?

I don't understand
what's happening here.

What do you mean?

Well, I'm just... I don't know.
I'm... I'm...

I'm having a hard time believing
that all of this is...

any better.

I guess I just have been...

worried for so long
that maybe I don't know

how to be happy anymore.

Hey.
[Miranda] No. It's...


It's fine. I'm fine. It's...

Just ignore me.

Look, there is...

something I keep meaning
to talk to you about.

Just come to the party.

Please.

I mean, you're kind of the eye
of the storm here anyway.

All right.

All right.

What you doing, Nana?

Just keeping an eye
on your mother.

How come?

That's what you do
when you love someone.

Then I'm gonna watch you
watch them.

Oh, I'm all done watching.

Oh. [chuckles]
Let me see.

Oh!

Looks the same
as it did last night.

You are a very lucky girl.

Aren't I just?

Not many men would be willing
to take on somebody

with your baggage.

That's an awful thing to say.

Why? It's true.

I mean, three kids,
a mountain of debt.

It's not a mountain.

Well, it's not
a molehill either.

You make me sound like
some sort of charity case.

I just don't want you to...

Oh, forget it.

No.

What?

Blow this.

I have been engaged

a whole twelve hours
and already...

Aren't you tired
of living under a cloud?

Nobody ever said
that life was easy.

I don't want it to be easy.

But I do want it to be worth it.

Bobby...

when are you going to stop
making everything

about loss and fear,

rather than gain and joy?

Mom!
Come see what I built!

Taffy?
[Miranda] Yeah.

It's gonna get messy,
so don't wear anything too nice.

Where is this coming from?

Oh, Bray got her talking
and she realized

that she just really
wants to have fun.

He's gone, right?

Yeah. No.
She invited him, so...

To a children's birthday party?
Dressed as what? A clown?

That wasn't very nice.

It wasn't meant to be.
I think it's weird.

He helped me, he helped Greg,
he helped Missy.

Now he's helping himself
to my fiancÃ©e.

You're being ridiculous.

Am I?

He's a family friend,
and he's coming to the party.

Get over it.

[pilot] <i>Engine failure.</i>

Help!


Hey! This guy's alive!

Morning, Mr. Johnson.

This just arrived for you.

Ah, yeah.
Thank you very much, Sloane.

And I printed out
those documents you wanted.

Excellent.

Would you possibly have
a manila envelope

and a pen I could borrow?
Sure thing.

[phone dings]

<i>â™ª Holding on

<i>â™ª Still wondering

<i>â™ª And the stars

I just thought it'd be nice
to show off

the whole new family, you know.

Okay! Lights are up.
Banner is hung. What else?

pull needs to go outside.

[Manny] You got it.
[Miranda] Thank you.

So? What's the deal with Bray?

He's hot.

So, does he have a girlfriend,
or what?

I'm pretty sure he's single.

Oh. Well, I think
I'll just go see

if he needs some help
with the fire.

[car horn honks]

<i>â™ª Don't know what is
On the horizon â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I know
that I'm on it... â™ª</i>

Oh, no! They're here!

It's too early.
Pretend I'm not here!

I'm not here!

<i>â™ª And the stars

Hi, girls! Welcome!

Honey, your friends are here!


<i>â™ª Oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, oh, oh, oh â™ª</i>

[indistinct chatter]

Are you thirsty?
Yeah. Thank you.

Yeah.

[indistinct chatter]

Like this, Mommy?

Yes, Bessie, that's perfect.
Just make sure

you keep it
over the wax paper, okay?

Who knew taffy
was such hard work?

Yeah. Yeah.

Mom keeps her own stash
in the glove box.

Which I noticed
is getting smaller and smaller.

You snooze, you lose.

I remember this candy store

right by LSU
that I discovered back

when I was gonna be a nurse.

You? A nurse? No way.

You mean,
was I actually a human being

before I became a mother?

Yes.

Soon to be again, I hope.

Wait, what?


Could I talk to you inside
for a moment?

Sure.
Back in a flash.

I wanna show you this.

What am I looking at?

"A sensor identifies
and redistributes

wasted energy into a grid

that can reassign
the loss into a gain."

Does that sound familiar?

It sounds like
one of Matty's projects.

Honey, this is Matty's project.
Bobby.

Saving energy's not a new thing.

He called you from the hotel.
He told you he met a fellow

inventor...
Matt wanted to take the heat

from the house and make it...
...who wanted to introduce him

to some people.
...into air conditioning.

It's not like he had a patent.
And that is why

he got on the damn plane!

So somebody else
came up with it. So what?

Well, not somebody.
Bray!

Next time, you might wanna
Google a man you run into.

That was page two!

I don't understand.

Your handyman
was at the same convention!

This is who Matty
was talking about.

That's the thief
that stole my son's invention!

You don't know that!

Oh, no? Well, ask him.

[indistinct chatter]

Bray?

Is this what I think it is?

Miranda...
Answer the question.

Yes, but...
Did you know Matthew?

Yes, I...
How dare you?

What the hell is going on?

Tuck, stay out of this.


I'm sorry.

I should've never...
Sorry about what?

For lying to my face?

Or stealing a dead man's idea
and selling it as your own?

Oh, whoa, no.
"Maybe I'll just check

on the widow,
see how she's doing!"

How creepy is that?
I didn't steal Matt's idea!

You need to leave!

Just give me a second.
We met in Vegas.

I had developed this
Grey Water Reclamation System,

and he had this sensor,
which was really smart.

And he showed it to me.
But sometimes it didn't work.

So he asked me for my advice.

We started kicking ideas around
and then suddenly,

out of the blue,
we came up with this energy grid

for office buildings that was...
And then he died!


Yes.

And where were you?

Sitting right next to him.

You...

You?

The guy who survived.

Because of a miracle
that not only saved my life,

but changed everything about it.

So, you're the guy they found?

You've got some nerve.

Miranda, the patent
just cleared last month.

I brought you the papers
as soon as I had them.

Then the storm came
and you just...

You seemed so...

Frail and helpless?
Is that what you think of me?

No. Far from it.

I don't need anyone to fix me.

I thought that
if I could just show yo...

You just need to go!

You just need
to get the hell out!

You heard the woman.
You gotta go.

[indistinct chatter]

Are you checking out?

Yep.

I'm afraid I'm going to have
to charge you for the night.

Oh, I understand.
Keep it on the same card?

Please.

Oh, and would you have
a messenger

deliver that tomorrow morning?

And you can go ahead
and charge that to my room too?

Sure.
Good luck with the LSAT.

Thanks. I'll need it.

Let me ask you something.

Can you see yourself
being a lawyer?

Yeah. Definitely.

Then so can I.


<i>There's a girl here
with a package!</i>

He was so nice I figured
why make him pay for a messenger

when I live, like,
five minutes from here.

Thank you so much.
Have a good day.

That from Bray?

Yeah.

Well, finally.

What do you mean?
He had that with him the day

I stayed home from school.
I thought he was from the bank.

Greg,
why didn't you say anything?

I'm not supposed to talk
to strangers, remember?




First of all,

you need to know that
one of your dad's inventions

sold for a great deal of money.

Apparently, it could be
the first check of many.

And I couldn't be
more proud of him.

Am I getting a pony?

No, baby.

But we do need to talk
about the future.

Okay, um...

Let me back up a little bit,
um...

I was caught off guard
the other night

when Tucker proposed.

Most people prefer that sort
of thing be done in private,

because it's a big deal
and very intimate.

And I think he was afraid
I might say no,

and so he hedged his bet
a little by doing it in public.

But the truth is,
I should've discussed it

with you guys first,
because it affects everybody.

It's not just about me.

You're the one
who has to sleep with him.

Well, that's not the point,
but thank you for that.

No.

The point is,
what do you want, Mom?

I don't know.

Well, if you don't know,

how are you supposed
to ask for it?

I guess I should figure
that out, shouldn't I?

Can I go back to bed now?

Absolutely.

Unless you wanna go
to the Apple store

and look at a new computer.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

It's still
your birthday weekend.

[Missy squeals]
Oh.


[indistinct chatter]

It's a half hour wait.
We don't have to stay.

I just thought it'd be fun
for you

to see where Mom
used to waitress.

We can go. Come on.

Maybe we should just
skip lunch and have ice cream?

[Bessie] Yay, ice cream!
Dude? We're leaving.

Bray told me a running back
once said that before the snap,

he can see the exact hole
he's gonna run through.

And then he trusts.

He believes that his guys
are gonna make their blocks.

And sure enough...
Okay, cowboy. Come on.

[door opens]

Miranda? Party of four?

I thought
it was a half an hour wait.

Well, the dad forgot his wallet,
so they left.

Touchdown! All right.

Right this way, guys.

Stop the car! Stop the car!


It's our mailbox!

[Missy] Holy crap!
[Miranda] Missy!

Wow.

What's it say?

"Miranda,
I should've said something

about all this the moment
I realized who you were,

and I feel really bad I didn't.

I only knew Matt a few days.

He was a special man
who loved his family dearly."

[dog barking]
[crickets chirping]

[woman yawns]

Oh! I can't believe I have
to go back to work tomorrow.

Oh, that's what Mondays are for.

How long was I out?

Well, long enough for me
to finish the dishes.

You've got it down to a science.

[Bray laughs]


Bessie?

What happened?

her tail back on and it slipped.

Now she's really dead.

And my fingers are stuck
together forever!

Oh, no, not forever, sweetie.

We just need a little
nail polish remover, okay?

Come on.


Well, we'll ask your brother.

But, you know, we might have
to get a new horse.

It's okay, sweetie.

[crickets chirping]

Dead pony?
[Miranda] Yep.

a kernel of corn up my nose?

Yes. And you were terrified
an ear of corn

was gonna sprout
out of your face.

What brought that up?

I don't know.

Thinking about Bessie
and how when you're younger

everything seems
so life and death.

You okay?

Did something happen?
No.

I just never
would have thought...

I don't know what I'm saying.

Yes, you do.
Just finish that sentence.

Bray.

What about him?

I never would've thought
of taffy if it weren't for him.

He just made everything lighter.

I mean,
look at that skylight.

It's totally
<i>Goodnight Moon</i> in here.

You're quite a kid,
you know that?


Have you called him?

No.
Why not?

Mom, he's everything
he said he was.

He just couldn't get out
of his own way is all.

And the sibs and I
were talking.

You were so much more relaxed
with him.

Do your homework.
What? You were.

Honey...

I barely know the man.

But you liked what you knew.

Now we turn to deriving
an equation of motion

from all of these ingredients.

<i>So let's consider
an extremum principle</i>

<i>for the motion
of a mechanical system.</i>

<i>What if we used the system
of an "N" particle,</i>

subject to active forces F-I
and constrained forces K-I?

So, what happens
when we add motion

to a structured system
like that?

[birds chirping]

Hey, sweetheart.

Thank you
for our beautiful kids.

I wish you could have seen
their faces when I told them.

You are their hero.

And mine too.

[keyboard clacking]

Hey.
Hey!

I thought you had
a dentist appointment.

I did.

Oh, great!
No more pain?

I'm sorry, Tuck.

I can't do this.

Yeah.

Okay.

Don't you wanna yell at me
or something?

Would it change your mind?

No.

But I think you're wonderful.

Right back at you.

I should probably quit.

Yeah.

Thank you.

<i>It was all right there
in the mailbox.</i>

Bray made Matt
co-owner of the patent,

even though it took him
another two years to perfect it.

Well, I still think
he should've said something.

I know.

He tried.

Which reminds me, um...

I broke up with Tucker.

What? Why?

Because I don't love him.

And I'm gonna go back to school.

What on earth for?

To continue my life.

I was gonna be a nurse.

Remember?
Mm-hmm.

And I was wondering,
if it's not too much to ask,

if you could babysit the kids
this weekend?

This weekend?

They don't know it yet, but...

I'm going on a little road trip
to check out some grad programs.

Look, I know
that you probably think

this whole second chance thing
is stupid.

You'd be wrong.

[indistinct chatter]

[doorbell rings]

Hi.

Hi, um...

I'm looking for Bray.

Oh, I'm afraid he's not here.

He had to take care
of some business out of town.

Would you like
to leave a message?

Oh, um...

No. [chuckles]

I was just in town
and thought...

Um, actually,

could you tell him Miranda Wells
stopped by?

You're Miranda?

Yeah.
[Jennifer] Oh, my gosh!

You're the reason he's not here!

I'm his sister, Jennifer.
I've heard so much about you!

You have?
Yes! And...

he's probably knocking
on your front door right now.

Come on, Nana!
All right, okay.

Oh, my gosh, you're doing it.

Oh, you see that?
You see that?

[knocking on door]
What am I hearing in my house?

Are we expecting anybody?

<i>You should have seen my face</i>

when your sister
opened the door.

any worse than mine

when Bobby answered yours.

Yeah. Okay. You win.

But, in a way,
it all kind of worked out.

She and I got to clear
the air about, you know,

pretty much everything, really.

And your sister and I
got to talk about nursing.

<i>Hey, I don't mean to be biased,</i>

but, uh, I hear Vanderbilt's
got a pretty good program.

Where are you right now?

Um, headed north on the 59. You?

I'm heading south on the 65.

Just two ships passing
in the night, huh?

Well, unless they wanna stop
for a coffee somewhere.

And maybe grab a waffle?

You like waffles?

Oh, yeah.
I particularly like the ones

just off exit 47
near Tuscaloosa,

which we both should be
reaching,

what, about sun-up?

Well...

what's a couple more hours
when it's taken me this long

to realize I can have
anything I want?

Then don't hang up.

Are you on the right street?

Oh, I see you.


You look great.
So do you.

Hi.
Hi.

So, uh...

[indistinct chatter]

[birds chirping]

Mom, where'd Bray go?

Oh, he got a call
from Eric Carlson up the road.

Said he was having trouble
with his barn.

some more ornaments up here.

Oh, on that side?

I can see this one.

[car horn honks]

Mommy! Look! It's a pony!

Thank you so much, Bray.

Imagine that?

[Bray] Say hi?
[Bessie] Hi!

That's so cute.

[indistinct chatter]
