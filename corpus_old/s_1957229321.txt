[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

So this prick

is telling me
that I'm responsible

because my horse
got his mare pregnant.

Like my stallion's
some kind of rapist.

Meanwhile, I've been telling this
lowlife that the fence between our yards

is too low for like ten months.

Danny owns property.

But this jerk off won't have it.
Says it'll be an eyesore.

Well, now you got yourself
a pregnant horse.

I mean horses are dumb animals.

You know, you gotta treat
them like retarded children.


Cake time! Aha!

[CLEARS THROAT]

JOAN AND GRACE:
Oh dear god.

They did a beautiful job.
Well, it's a job.

Why in the hell is there a picture
of Javier Bardem on the cake?

Did she just call me
Javier Bardem?

It's beautiful!

SAM:
I'll cut it.

Javier?

[GLASS CLINKING]

Everyone.

Everyone.

Sit down dear, please.

I just want to wish Kat
a very happy birthday.

I love you Kat...

so I'm just going to tell you
what everyone here is thinking.

Here we go.

We all thought you'd
be engaged by now.

I don't know what
went wrong this time,

but let's hope we don't have
to wait another six years

for a good one to
come along again.

Honey. Honey...

You are my baby...

and you will always be my baby,
and I love you with all my heart.

And to prove that, I have
a little present here for you.

No, Mom, I...
I know, I know.

She just hates to open gifts
in front of people.

But I'm your mommy
and you will do as I say.

Ok.

Closer to Closeness, A healing
retreat for couples in trouble.

What the...
Your father, that son-of-a-bitch,

walked out on me three times
before I got him to marry me.

Sweetheart, please,
do not quit on Ray.

All he needs is a little nudge.

Mom, I broke up with him.

Wow, Joan, that was
a very thoughtful gift.

Well honey, I would be very
happy to buy one for you

when you manage to stay in a relationship
long enough for it to matter.

Okay, I hate to be a party
pooper, but...

I will open my gifts at home,
because...

Because we have to meet
some friends at a tequila bar.

KAT:
That's right, and, wow.

You guys are amazing,
and I can't thank you enough

for this amazing
birthday dinner, and...

Hey! What bar are you going to?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Goodnight everyone!

Goodbye Javi.
Don't worry, I've got 'em.

Javier.

Closer to Closeness,
a healing retreat for couples...

...for couples.
I know, it's ridiculous.

You do realize it's my birthday.

Ooh, it's a massage.
I hate massages.

I'll take it.

Okay, it was my longest
relationship, almost two years.

Well, a year and two months
but who's counting?

But I knew it wasn't right.

I hate coasters.

Oh you know what,
and just for the record...

I have had long term
relationships too.

I know.

So, I don't really know what
your mother was implying.

My mother doesn't imply.
She clearly states.

I mean, that gift.

Wait a minute. So she meant
what she said about me?

Yeah.

What the fuck?

I mean, anybody who knows me knows
that even if I were still with Ray,

I wouldn't go to some bullshit,
crunchy granola, love fest.

God, I need a vacation.

You should go just to spite her.

Hm.
Hm.

You have to be a couple.

So, pick a friend and go.

Okay, you wanna go?

Hmm, don't joke
because I would do that.

Yeah you would, wouldn't you.

Wait,
that's a really funny idea.

Oh no.

Just hear me out.
Look at this place.

That's a nice pool.

It's a really nice pool.

Plus, listen to this: Couples
will receive group therapy...

Eww.
Massages...

I hate massages.

They will face adventure
challenges...

Seriously?

And most importantly, couples will
learn how to stop loving small

learning to feast at the banquet table
of love, as opposed to the kiddie table.

Oh it is so good.

I don't want to be at the
kiddie table of love anymore.

No, you deserve to be
at the big girl table.

We could use this.
No, we deserve this.

Plus it's paid for, and it would
make your mother happy.

I hate you.

Which is exactly why we're
going to go on this journey

to get "closer to closeness."

Give me back my coasters.

No I'm not gonna give
you back your coasters.

You're not going to need them
at the banquet table of love.

I'm hungry.

Are we gonna do this?

What? Pretend to be a couple?

Oh you're so right.
You're a terrible liar.

You would break
within two hours.

That is so not true.
I could totally do it.

I don't think so.

Let's flip for it.

Heads we do, tails we don't.

Ok.
Ok.

Here, you do the honors.
Ok.

It's your birthday.
It's my birthday.

[COIN HITS THE FLOOR]

[KNOCK AT DOOR]

How are you not hung over?

I told you, seltzer water,
a little dash...

Shut up.

This is so not a good idea.

Can you relax?
It's gonna be a breeze.

I can't believe they had
an opening for this weekend.

I know. I called
the emergency hotline.

They had an emergency hotline?

Yeah.

And what did you tell them?

I told them that we're having
some issues in our relationship

that we had to work through.
What problems are we having?

Just roll with it.

You know, I can tell them how you create
a situation where there's no intimacy,

and then use that as
your excuse to leave.

What's that supposed to mean?

Sweetie. Come on.

Okay, um, I guess I can tell them how
good you are at creating intimacy,

right before you sabotage the
whole thing and it turns to shit.

Oh, That's rich coming from Miss
"Oh, I'm so enlightened...

because I actually went a whole
year in a relationship."

You're an asshole.
And you're a raving bitch.

See? Piece of cake.

Oh, and if anyone asks,
you're the top.

Why am I the top?

Really? Look at us.
Who's gonna buy me as the top?

You serious?

SAM: Let's go!
Chop, chop, lemon drop.

Spoken like a true top.

[UPBEAT POP MUSIC]

SAM:
Oh this is nice.

KAT:
Very nice.

SAM: I don't want to say
I told you so, but...

KAT:
Then don't.


It's nice.
Yeah.

You must be Samantha
and Katherine.

And you must be Jacqueline.
Welcome.

Hi, I'm Samantha.
This is Kat.

Hi.
I'm so glad you came.

Me too.

TOM:
Hello ladies!

This is Tom.
He handles all our maintenance.

Hi, Samantha.

Katherine.
Hi.

Here, let me take your bags
for you.

No, no, no. She's got them.

No, no, no, really,
it's no trouble at all.

I'll just throw them in
your room for you?

Great.

It's room five, Tom. Thanks!

Katherine, I know how difficult
this must be for you.

This work can be
pretty challenging,

especially for someone
with your issues.

But you should know that
just you being here

means the world
to Samantha.

Anything for Sam.

Come on, I'll show you around.

Come on, Kat.


So, this will be your room
for the weekend,

and here are
your workbooks

and your schedules.

Why don't you settle in,
get comfortable...

we'll all meet for introductions
in the great room in an hour.

Wow, there is a lot of stuff
going on.

Katherine, if any of these exercises
feel uncomfortable for you,

please just talk to Bob
or myself.

We can organize an alternative.

Okay.
Great.

I'll see you soon.

Yeah.

What did you tell her?

Nothing.

I just let her know what
some of your issues are.

My issues?

Well, I had to let her know
why we were coming here.

So we're here
because of my issues?

No, I have issues too.

What did you tell her
my issues were?

Hey! You said you wanted to be
able to just hang out by the pool,

so I let her know that some of
this stuff might be hard for you.

SAM:
What with your intimacy issues.

And your mild social anxiety
disorder.

I don't have social anxiety
disorder.

Which is why I said 'mild'.

Why would you tell her that?

So we could skip the exercises.

I don't know Sam, I think
it would be a shame to...

...be here and not
take advantage

of all of these very helpful
exercises.

Kat.

So, I guess you'll just have
to talk to Jacqueline

if you feel like you
can't handle it.

Are you seriously
going to punish me

just because I made you out
to look a little neurotic?

Oh yeah.

[SITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

Hey everyone,
sorry we're late. We had...

Stop talking.
Ok.

Well, now that we're all here...

Welcome everyone to our
Closer to Closeness weekend.

It's wonderful to see
all of you.

Some familiar faces
and many new ones.

My wife Jacqueline
and I are thrilled

to be taking this journey
with you.

We don't think of ourselves
as teachers, per se.

Rather as living examples

of how fruitful and rewarding
this work can be.

Much like Shamans.

What Bob is trying to say
is that

we're not really here
to teach you anything new.

This work is really about
removing road blocks...

and getting back to why you
fell in love in the first place.

You may find that the love
you rediscover here...

is greater than any love
you imagined was possible.

Amen to that!

We've also found the weekend
tends to be a group experience,

so we hope you'll support each
other through the exercises...

and choose to learn from
each others' strengths

as well as each others'
limitations.

Well, let's get right to it,
shall we?

We'd like to ask you
to introduce your partner,

and share with the group
something about them

that you appreciate the most,

and what you hope they'll consider
working towards while they're here.

Suzie and Ken,
why don't you start.

Allow me to introduce
the love of my life.

My beautiful wife Suzie.

What I love most
about you is

your limitless capacity
to love,

and your boundless passion.

What I would love
for you to consider is

to start spending less time

worrying about my well-being,

and start spending more
time worrying about yours.

Ken,

what I love most about you

is your sensitivity.

Guilty!

What I hope you would consider

is truly believing

how much I value and love you.

Um,

this is my husband, Scott.

What I love most about him is

his kindness...

and his laugh...

and his ability
to put up with my shit.

Guilty.

What I hope that you will
consider, this weekend, Scott,

is taking things a little bit
more seriously

and

talking more
about your feelings.

Okay, this is my gorgeous wife,

Chloe.

What I love about her,
is pretty much everything.

Uh, what I hope that you
will consider, Chloe,

is making this the last time we
have to do something like this.


No offense, you guys seem great.

Thank you for your honesty,
Scott.

I guess I'll go. Um,

this is my husband, David.

And what I appreciate
about him is that he's a...

he's a great dad
to our daughter...

and I'm not sure what I want
him to work on this weekend,

because...

honestly, he asked me to
come to this, and so I'm here.

And I don't,

I don't really have anything
else to say right now. Sorry.

Uh, this is obviously my wife,
Rebecca.

And, uh, she is a great mother,
and

I think the reason she's having
a difficult time explaining

why we're here this
weekend is because...

we used to be great.

And

lately she's been really
unhappy...

and so we're here to figure out
what's going on with her.

Uh, hi all. Um,

this is my partner, Jonah.

What I love most about you,
um, is your spirit...

and integrity.

I mean, look, I, I know I process
things differently than you,

um, but I hope that by being
here, you will realize that we...

we actually do want
the same things.

So, this is J.K.

What I love the most about you,

you're one of the kindest
people that I know,

and I love the way you love me.

I wanted us to come here because I still
feel there's still some hesitation...

and there can't be.

Not with this.

We're about to adopt a baby.

BOB:
Oh, beautiful. Thank you.

Ok, um, here I go.

Hi, everyone, um, this is Kat...

my lover.

Um, Kat,
what I adore about you is...

I can talk to you about
just about anything,

you do make me laugh,
and you are my best friend.

It's true.

What I hope you will consider,
really consider, is

learning how to let go...

this weekend, even if that means
just, you know, admitting something

might be too hard for you and
just choosing to sit by the pool.

Um, maybe

address those demons
that make you act out...

when all I'm trying to do
is show you love.

And, uh,

most importantly...

please stop being so hard on yourself
about your social anxiety disorder.

It's mild.

Wow, Sam, thank you
for your honesty. Um...

There's just so much
I want to say right now.

Where do I begin? Um...

This is my boo, Samantha.

Sam, what I love about you

is, um, your uncanny ability
to know what I'm thinking

without my even having to say it.
Hmm.

And even though
you've had so, so,

so many different partners,

you have always made me feel like
I'm in a category all my own.

And, uh,

what I hope you will
consider this weekend is

not

taking it personally when I

don't want to make
love every single day.

Sometimes twice a day.

Just...

know that our needs are different,
and sometimes I'm just tired. Okay?

BOB:
Excellent. Thank you.

We were right out
of high school,

handyman business. Cash only.

You know, we didn't even
file for income tax.

But then, we got married,
and a couple months into the marriage...

Chloe takes over the
business side, and boom.

Yeah, he and his brother
had the construction part down,

but forgot all about
the company part.

So, I had to step in and crack the
whip on tweedle-dum and tweedle-dumber.


Which one am I?

Aww, honey if you have to ask...

Oh, she got ya.

So, have you guys ever taken
one of those Atlantis cruises?

No. No, we did the, uh,
the Rosie O'Donnell cruise.

It was awesome.

JONAH:
Really?

I thought that was primarily
for gay families.

We brought my mother.

Kat brought her mother.

My mother's a big fan
of Rosie O'Donnell's.

So, you guys are adopting?

We are.

JONAH: Are you planning
on having children?

Yeah, maybe someday, um...

We kind of just want this time
to be for us right now, you know?

I get it.

You have to know
when the time is right.

David and Rebecca,
you have a daughter?

Carolyn, yeah.
She's really great. Very lucky.

Well, we're lucky now.

I don't think we slept
the first two years, remember?

Don't tell J.K that.

I do love my sleep.

What I remember is that I got up at night
because you couldn't handle the stress.

Remember that?

It was literally like
having two kids.

But it's cool because, you know,
now our daughter's almost a teenager

and all she wants to do
is sleep, so...

Unless she's twittering,
or tweetering.

It's tweeting.

Tweeting, whatever it's called,
it's annoying.


Well, I don't let it get to me.

I believe that something can't
bother you unless you allow it to.

You know?

For what it's worth, I think
you'll make wonderful parents.

Everyone, we are going to head
down to the fireplace now

for our second exercise
and some dessert.

SUZIE:
Ooh good.

SUZIE:
Yum yum yum.

J.K.:
That's so inappropriate.

SAM:
So wrong.

You've got a little bit there.

Want me to kiss it off?

Mmmhmm.

So, um, how long
have you been a lesbian?

This next exercise can
appear quite simple, but

please just give yourselves
the gift of being

as honest and as open
as you possibly can.

Ok, my first heartbreak.

I fell in love with a young
man when I was 17,

and we were going
to get married,

but I didn't want to start a new life with
him until we had some kind of stability,

so I suggested that he enlist

in the hope that this would give
him some direction in his life.

But he never returned.

And when I found out
that he died,

the sense of loss and guilt
was just...

completely overwhelming.

So when Bob came into my life

I just refused to open
my heart again

for fear of having it broken.

But, thanks to this work, and...

this wonderful man...

we left that behind us
a long time ago.

It's not always easy, but the love
that we share makes it worth it.

Perhaps, um,
Samantha and Katherine

could go next.

Okay, um...

Ok, so, I was pretty young,
for mine.

I was, um, 15,

and I had just lost my virginity
to my boyfriend Johnny,

who was a couple years older,

and the next night we went
to an AC/DC concert, yeah.

And, um, he met some girl there
and he and broke up with me

right there at the concert.

It was awful.

I pretty much can't hear
AC/DC to this day, so...

No, she really can't.

Okay, uh, my first heartbreak
wasn't actually a relationship.

It was my father.

Um.

My dad traveled a lot for work,
and

every time he was leaving
for a trip,

he would come into our room
and he would sing

"Leaving on a Jet Plane" for us.

Oh, I love that song!

Yeah, me too.

Um.

And then one night
when I was six,

he came in to the room
and he sang the song,

and this time he
didn't come back.

He took off
and started a new family.

And I've only seen him
once since then,

and that was 15 years ago, so...

Anyway, all I know is that

if AC/DC ever does a cover
of "Leaving on a Jet Plane,"

we are screwed.


BOB:
Well done.

Rebecca and David?

Uh, my first heartbreak.

Uh, I guess for me

it's been a series
of heartbreaks, really.

Since I met Rebecca she
had a lot of ups and downs.

The most recent one was
that she lost her dad,

and they had a lot of unresolved

issues between them.

It broke my heart to

see her so broken.

Oh, Jesus.

What? What did I do this time?

You're doing it again.

Do you not see how that sounds?

It's like somehow I am damaged
and that's your only issue.

My dad died five years ago,

and granted, I did not handle
that well, but I am fine now.

Can we please move on?

Well look, I'm sorry.
I just don't trust it, ok?

I just can't pretend that I'm not waiting
for the other shoe to drop because it will.

It always does.

Wow, David. Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

If I could just interject
for a second, David.

Our focus is supposed to
be on a prior heartbreak

which is affecting
our current relationship.

Perhaps you could go back to
a time before you met Rebecca.

I understand Jacqueline, I do.

But the truth is,

anything that happened before
her doesn't really compare.

God, You know, that,
that almost sounds loving.

But you know what?

You know, you're the one who
wanted to come here and get honest?

Well the truth is, our marriage
does not work if I'm not a mess,

and I think you hate it that I
don't need you as much anymore.

That's a little unfair to me,
don't you think?

No, I...

You can't expect me
to be a different person

because you just happen
to feel alright this week.

It is not this week.

REBECCA: It's been five years.
And I don't expect you

REBECCA:
to be a different person.

I married you when I was 25 years
old, and I have grown up since then.

And I don't think you know
what to do with that.

And I see you doing
the same thing with Carolyn.

You're terrified that she's
getting a mind of her own.

Do not bring her into this.

DAVID:
Look, I still love you, ok?

I still want you. I want this.

You're the one that decided
that, that all of the sudden,

we're not good enough anymore.

I'm...

DAVID:
I'm sorry.

DAVID:
Uh.

You know what?

Why don't you just figure out
who you want to be this week,

and then I can adjust
to suit you.

That seems to work.

This is who I am, David.

And I am not going back
to the person I was.

And I wish to God you would just
admit you don't like me anymore.

Thank you.

Please continue everyone.

KEN: And she was lying
in the middle of the road.

KEN:
Lifeless.

I loved that damn cat.


To Tinkerbell.

ALL:
To Tinkerbell.

Tinkerbell.

Thank you, thank you.

So, thank you all
for sharing your

beautiful and deeply
personal stories.

As our first night
comes to a close,

Bob and I would like you to do
what we refer to as "Roomwork."

Tonight, the gentleman
will be receiving,

and in the case of the same-sex
couples, it's up to you.

JACQUELINE:
When you return to your rooms,

we ask that you provide
your partner

with a 20 minute
non-sexual massage.

This is all about the
therapeutic nature of touch,

and just allowing your partner
to bring you to a state of bliss

with no expectation
of anything further.

It's all explained on page six
of the workbook.

And finally,

just in order not to dilute the
work that we'll be doing here,

we do strongly suggest that you refrain
from having sex while you're here.

Great idea.

You okay with that?

Yeah.

So, thank you all for today

and I know I speak for Bob, too,

when I say we can't wait
until tomorrow.

KEN:
Well thank you Jacqueline.

SUZIE:
Good night.

SUZIE:
Good night everyone.

SUZIE:
See you at breakfast.

Katherine?
Yes?

That was incredible work today.

Your willingness and your
bravery in participating,

it shows me just how much this
relationship really means to you.

Good night ladies. Sleep well.
Good Night.

Good night.

Will you stop making me out to be some
kind of sex addict in front of the group.

Sorry, it's probably just symptomatic
of my social anxiety disorder.

I said mild...

Where are you going?

SAM:
Huh? To take off my make-up.

Uh-uh.

Uh-uh?

Someone owes me a non-sexual
massage and I'm ready to receive it.

Oh you're kidding.

Roomwork. Get over here.

You hate massages.

KAT: Hey, this weekend
was your brilliant idea

so if they should ask me
tomorrow morning,

I need to be able to respond

with my usual willingness
and bravery.

I will forgo my hatred
for this one night.

SAM:
You are such an asshole.

Ok, five minutes.

It says here at least 20.

Six.

Ten.

Seven.

Deal.

I hate you.

Let's go, lover.

Oh, I feel closer to you
already.

Ow.

You want to ease up there?
Will you shut up and relax?

Oh, perfect. Right there.

Are you kidding me?
What?

I just said "right there" and a second
later you moved to another spot.

I did?

Oh my God, if we were
having sex right now

and I said, "Perfect,
right there,"

would you move to another place?

I'm sorry, I wasn't listening
to you. I was distracted.

By what?

Do you think J.K and Jonah
are faking it too?

I am getting a very
straight vibe from J.K.

I'm just saying, I think
he might be a little into me.

I worry about you. I really do.

You don't see it?

No.

Well, then you're blind.
It's palpable.

I can't believe you told
them about your father.

It took you five years
to tell me that.

Yeah, that was weird.

[MUFFLED SEX SOUNDS]

Is that Scott and Chloe?
Shhhh!

Fucking cheaters.

What the fuck?

Oh, sorry, I'm not tired yet.

I'm just going to read
a little bit.

No, what the fuck is that?

It's a reading lamp.
Go to sleep.

So you're not tired after your
hard day down in the coal mine?

Shut up.

Seriously, it's a miracle
that anyone has sex with you.

Well, I don't wear it when
I'm having sex, Kat.

I'm trying to be considerate.


Shut up!

[MUFFLED BANGING AND SEX SOUNDS]

Holy shit, is everyone
getting laid tonight?

Well, we know who's not.

Whose room is that?

Well whoever it is
they're rule breakers!

Ugh, now I'm awake.

Do you remember that guy at Wendy's
Christmas party two years ago?

The one with the rainbow
suspenders?

Who could forget him?

Who would you rather fuck,
upon pain of death?

Him?

Or the guy in the office next to yours who
always has spit in the corner of his...

Rainbow suspenders.

Okay, who would you rather fuck?

Rainbow suspenders or that guy that
Ingrid brought to the barbecue.

The one with the girly ass?

Eww. Rainbow suspenders.

Whoa.

Rainbow Suspenders is 2 and 0.

Ray asked me to marry him.

KAT:
The night I broke up with him.

Why didn't you tell me that?

Because I felt like
such an asshole.

I don't know what happened.

KAT:
He asked, I froze.

...and I looked at him
and I thought,

are you the rest of my life?

KAT:
And I couldn't.

Plus, I saw us sitting on the couch
and all I could see was my mother.

You're nothing like your mother.

No, I meant him.

My cousin Kerry

used to date a guy who would
hawk loogies at the dinner table.

Rainbow Suspenders
or the guy who hawked loogies?

Rainbow suspenders.

Sup.
What's up?

Morning.

I'm telling.

It's a stupid rule.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Good morning everyone.

I'm afraid we have some
sad news.

Rebecca and David will not
be continuing on with us.

What?

BOB: They asked me
to apologize to all of you

for disrupting your weekend.

This is not a situation
we deal with often here...

and we understand it may affect
the harmony of the group.

If anyone wants to

reschedule,

or get a refund...

we'd be happy to do that.

Well, that is such a shame.

SUZIE:
We already had such a special

group dynamic happening.

KEN:
You know what?

If anybody else
is thinking of leaving,

please just go now,

because I could not take another
disappointment like this. This is...

Then, enjoy your breakfast.

SUZIE:
If we can.

KEN:
Really. After that?

You've gotta be kidding.

CHLOE: We're supposed
to be doing an exercise

for a reason here.

Down...
Down.

Back toward yourself.
What the?

No. Come on, come on.

I was towards myself.

Can we get another egg?

Alright.

J.K., please.

I'm looking right at you.

It's an inch to your left.

J.K.?

If you listen to me,
I'll guide you....

I did it?
Yeah you did it.

OK.

Who's the egg master?

I'm the egg master.

Okay.

You were right. Yay.

Ok, not okay.

This is a trust exercise.

It's not about you, Jonah.
Let it go.

Actually, it is about me.

We're planning on having
a baby together.

You don't even trust me enough
to guide your egg onto a cone?

J.K.:
I trust you.

JONAH:
I don't think so.

A stupid ex... I took my
blindfold off! So what?

You don't get why that's
a problem?

No, I don't.

BOB:
Okay, gentlemen.

Intense feelings coming up here.

J.K., can you tell Jonah
what it is you're experiencing?

I'm experiencing...

He's getting bent out of shape
because of an egg.

See, this is what I'm talking about.
Why are we even here?

Ok, try this for me.

J.K., whatever it is you're
feeling, I want you to cluck it.

Cluck it like a chicken!

What?

In nature, animals communicate with
each other without the need of words.

BOB:
Let go!

Just tell Jonah how you feel

in chicken.

I'm sorry, I'm not doing that.

Oh. Ok. You know what J.K.?

Babies are messy, life is messy.

How are you going to handle that
if you can't even let it go here?

Ok.

You want to know the truth?

Yeah, that would be nice.

This isn't about the baby,

okay? It's about...

you.

I don't think you're ready
for this.

I mean, how do you know that
you're not going to wake up one day

and decide that this whole
thing isn't for you?

Well I don't know
if that's going to happen.

Just like I don't know you'll wake up one
morning and you're not in love with me anymore.

Come on guys.

How can you even talk about
raising a baby with me?

Ok, there it is.

You're not worried about me,
you're worried about you.

We're always going to be
tied together as parents...

even though we're not guaranteed
we're going to make it as a couple

and that's scary as hell.

But do you think that you're the only
one that's risking something here?

I know what I want. Do you?

[CLUCKS LIKE CHICKEN]
Yes.

Jonah, what do you
have to say to that?

[CLUCKS LIKE CHICKEN]

[CLUCKS LIKE CHICKEN]

[CLUCKS LIKE CHICKEN]

[CLUCKS LIKE CHICKEN]

[BOTH CLUCKING BACK AND FORTH]

[CLUCKS LIKE CHICKEN]

[BOTH IMITATING DOGS]


How is this any different
than usual?

[BOTH MOOING LIKE COWS]

Don't do it. Don't do it.


[BOTH MEOWING LIKE CATS]



Mew?

You are one unit,

moving through space and time.

Try to match your breath
with their breath.

Alright, switch. Let the other
person takeover as leader.

Try to be seamless.

Kat, can you take this seriously?
This is very important to me.

Switch.

Perhaps by now you're feeling
as though there is no leader,

there's no follower.

The movement is just

flowing between you like an

unspoken communication.

BOB:
Excellent Suzie and Ken!

BOB:
Beautiful synergy!


Sorry.


Ladies...

Oh Jacqueline, we are so sorry...

Mind if I steal one of those?

Sure.

Mmmm.

Don't tell Bob. I quit five
years ago, he'd kill me.

That's cool.
No problem.

I think I know what's going
on here, by the way.

JACQUELINE:
Sometimes we get couples

JACQUELINE:
who aren't really in trouble.

They just want to get away
for the weekend,

they think it might be
a bit of a hoot.

Sometimes they get a lot out
of it despite themselves.

JACQUELINE:
Worst case scenario,

they leave with some
good stories.

I'm guessing Samantha might
have exaggerated

the trouble you're having
in your relationship.

Am I right?

Well she really is fucked up.

Thanks for the cigarette,
ladies.

And by the way,

as much as I really do
believe in this work...

sometimes it takes everything
I've got not to lose it.

I think I'm in love with her.

I think we should see
other people.

So soon?

Wow! What a blast!

Almost as fun as last night.

KAT:
I totally see it now.

Palpable.

BOB:
Great job, Suzie!

Who wants to try next?

I'll go.

Sweetie, I know you're are a
little heartbroken right now...

Shut up.

Nice job.

Sure you want to do this?
Mmm hmm.

Do you want me to ask your boyfriend
to come over here and do it?

Palpable.

It was palpable.

It was a magical night.
Have fun.

See you on the bottom.

BOB:
There she goes.

Ooh.

Mmm.

Sam, what's up?

Sam?

I can't move.

What?

I can't move.

What do you mean you can't move?

I can't move. I can't move!

Okay, you don't have to do this.
Just come back down.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh.

Shit, I really can't move.

KEN:
Come on Samantha!

We're all behind ya!

You can do this sweetheart.

Don't let the fear get the best
of you.

Just put one foot
in front of the other.

Oh really, J.K.?
Is that what I should do?

Just put one foot
in front of the other?

That is great advice
if I could move.

Oh shit.
I'm gonna die up here.

Oh fuck, that's worse.

Samantha?
Uh huh.

You want me to come up there
and walk you down?

No thank you.

Tie me in.

Hi.

Hi.

How ya doin'?

Not so good.

I don't get it,
I'm not afraid of heights.

Well I am.
Oh God.

Oh I'm sorry.

Ooh, ooh I can't breathe.
Why can't I breathe?

You're having an anxiety attack.

No, I don't get those.

You do now.

Am I having a heart attack?
I can't feel my appendages.

Who says appendages?

Oh my lips are numb.

Okay, honey?
Mmmhmm?

I know you're in a bad way.

'Cause one, you just yelled
at your gay boyfriend.

And two, you just refused
help from a man.

Oh my God, what's wrong with me?

Oh my God, I can't do this.

Ok, if I can't get you down, Bob's
gonna have to call the fire department.

Oh I love firemen.
I know you do.

I don't really want to see
firemen right now.

Let's do this.

We can do this.
We can.

Oh god.
I know.

We can do this.
Oh god.

Here we go.
Ok.

Ok.
Ok.

Give me your hand.
Fuck you.


Ok.

Your turn.

Aaaaand...

...she's down! Lunchtime!

You doing alright?
Yeah.

I'm sorry.
I freaked out up there.

Ah, you've got nothing
to apologize for.

The ropes course is a very scary
experience for some people.

BOB: Though truthfully,
I've never seen

anyone else react
quite so strongly to it.

And I guess technically you didn't
even actually do the ropes course...

But, hey, kudos for trying it!

Oh God.

Look, the important thing is that you were
able to overcome an obstacle as a couple.

And that's the point.
Mmm hmm.

BOB:
Great attitude.

See you at lunch.

Thank you... for that.

I should be thanking you. I
didn't have to do the exercise.

Seriously. I really honestly could
not have done that without you.

I would take you over a fireman
any day of the week.

Unless he was hot.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

How are you feeling?

I heard you ran into some
trouble on the ropes course.

Oh Jacqueline, you would
have been so proud of them.

They were such a team up there.

KEN:
It's true.

Samantha was a crying mess,
yelling at everyone,

and Kat just climbed right on
up there and talked her down.

KEN:
It was beautiful to see.

Thanks, Ken.

Well, the ropes course isn't about how
athletic you are. It's about trust...

...and it seems
you both found that.

Good for you.

I am pretty athletic.

You know, I just got a little
freaked out up there. That's all.

You know, Suze and I are so
impressed with the two of you.

I mean, you actually remind
us a little bit of ourselves.

Were you friends before?

We sure were.

SUZIE:
I knew it!

You know, Ken and I were friends for
eight years before we got together.

I was still married at the time,
and Ken had just gotten divorced.

Of course, I always thought
she was a hottie, but, you know,

I never really looked
at her that way.

So what happened?
How did you guys get together?

Well, after I divorced,
I dated up a storm for a couple of years.

Man after man after man.

Oh yeah, there were a lot of men and
I got to hear about every one of them.

SUZIE:
And then I realized,

every new beau that I met,

I would compare him to Ken.

He doesn't make me laugh
the way Ken does...

SUZIE:
He doesn't make me feel safe

the way Ken does.

Meanwhile, I was having a hard time
finding any woman worth dating.

SUZIE:
Then one night, Ken was over,

and I was crying on his shoulder
about my latest dating disaster,

and then before you knew it,

Ken and I were going
at it like two teenagers.

KEN:
It was intense.

I had never had orgasms
like that.

Yeah, mine were so deep,
I cried.

He did.

SUZIE:
We were so intimate

as friends, so close,
that it never dawned on me

that we could be that
attracted to each other.

SUZIE: I had been looking
for that closeness

with other men, but with them

I never felt the connection.

SUZIE: When you start
with a solid friendship,

the rest is just icing
on the cake.

We are all so lucky.

Sexuality.

JACQUELINE: We've all met
that perfect person on paper

that we just can't find
the chemistry with.

Now we can't just push a button

to drum up a basic attraction
to somebody, but

who and what we are attracted
to changes as we grow as people.

We shift perspective,
we open our hearts,

and suddenly

we're attracted in different
ways and to different things.

Now, sexuality usually boils down to
trust, lust, or conflict.

Which one are you?

Now here, this is conflict.

Remember, conflict was the foundation
of many of the great love affairs,

great works of art,
even friendship.

That's a beautiful
display of trust.

Ladies, it looks like you might
be struggling with this one a bit.

No, we're just trying to decide
whether to go with trust or lust.

Yeah, and Kat's just so
used to being the top,

she's having a hard
time giving over to...

Hmm. Okay.

Um, perhaps a little bit of
guidance might be useful.

Everyone, do you think we can
give Kat and Samantha some help

in finding their sexual
personality?

[GONG RINGS]

Bob.

How would you describe
what you're seeing here?

PietÃ¡.

Heimlich.

Um... awkward?

Good, Chloe. Awkward.

Katherine, Samantha,
we are dealing with intimacy,

and the word 'awkward'
comes to mind.

Let's try something.

I'd like you to turn
and face one another.

Now, look into each other's
eyes.

No, that's good, that's good.

Take a moment
to explore why this

kind of intimacy is
uncomfortable for you.

We'll wait.

JACQUELINE: Uncomfortable just means
we're breaking through barriers.

Clearly there was some level
of attraction

that drew you into
this relationship,

and yet you seem to be
struggling with your sexuality.

I want you to embrace
one another.

Feel her arms around you.

JACQUELINE:
And just, in this moment,

allow yourself to feel safe
in her embrace.

Usually, what gets in the way of
intimacy is fear.

So just, in this moment,

let go of everything else
and give over to her.

I'm going to ask you some questions.
Answer to yourselves.

Do you feel safe with her?

Do you believe she loves you?

Now look at each other.

Is there anyone,

in this moment,
in this life...

you can imagine yourself
being with other than her?

Then what scares you
about saying yes

to what is right
in front of you?

Cramp.

Cramp?

JACQUELINE:
Cramp.

Uh, I have a cramp.
I need to...

walk it off. Need air.

Hey.
Hey.

You okay?
Yeah.

Okay...

Do we need to talk about
anything?

No.

Okay.

I'm sorry,
I have to say something.

Is it just me, or are you
feeling something weird?

I feel like there's something
going on here that's weird.

Guess it's just me.

Sam?

Yeah.

I'm...

...gonna go for a walk.

Okay.

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

There you are.

Here I am.

How's the cramp?

It's good.

I mean, It's better.
Good. That's good.

SAM:
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

[JIGGLING TOILET HANDLE]
Go down, go down.

SAM:
Seriously? Ok.

Ok.

KAT: You want me to say
something, don't you?

I don't know, is there something
you want to say?

Not really.

I'm not much of a talker.
I just like to...

...process things in
a quiet way. I just...

like to...

process.

I'd really just rather do it
by myself. Honest.

Tell you what.

I'll go with you so you don't
have to bring the plunger back,

but you can handle it.

Deal?
Great.

KAT: I mean, the truth is,
I think this weekend has

complicated our relationship.

In what way?

I don't want to talk about it.

In the way that all
of these exercises

are just stirring up
a bunch of shit,

and I don't see the point.

Your girlfriend seems nice.

Yeah, she's great.

I don't know if I'd call her
my girlfriend per se.

We're kind of in an
experimental phase, you know?

Watch yourself.

I came here with my girlfriend a few
years ago, and we ended up married.

Oh, you're married,
that's great.

Ah, no, well divorced now. Yeah.

I met a lot of women
like that and

they always seem to
end up pretty unhappy.

You know the type.

They love the attention
in the beginning,

kind of get a high off of it,
but

when it gets too real, they
find a way to screw it all up.

They just can't handle
true intimacy.

I don't know, maybe for some
women it's not about the intimacy.

You know, maybe some women

just tend to attract guys
who are great are first

and then they turn into
real jerks.

The bottom line is, you're here,
and things are coming up.

You might have been
comfortable before, but

how deep were you
really prepared to go?

I'm just saying, a lot of women say
they want to be in a relationship,

but they're not really
willing to go there.

TOM: They keep jumping
from guy to guy,

and it's not going to be so cute
when you turn fifty

and you're flirting
with your mechanic,

hoping to get some attention
that only lasts a few minutes.

TOM: I mean, my ex is on her
fifth guy since we split up.

I just don't want to see her settling
for some loser she can't stand

when she realizes
she's out of options.

Oh my God. That's me.

Huh?

I'm in love
with falling in love.

We all love that part,
that's not so bad.

Oh don't placate me.
You just said it!

I'm going to end up
alone and miserable

and then I'm gonna get
rejected by my mechanic.

I was talking about my ex-wife.

I am your ex-wife.

I'm so confused here.

Don't you get it?!

KAT:
Or maybe

our relationship is exactly
where it's supposed to be

and there is no deeper for us.

Maybe.

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

Thank you!

Oh shit.

Hey, I, uh...

have you been crying?

No.

Okay, um.

So I do think we need to talk.

Yeah? Are you sure there isn't
some cramp you need to walk off?

Okay, I'll start. Uh...

That thing that happened
in the last exercise...

So something did happen.

I never denied that
something happened.

But I said, "Do we need
to talk about anything,"

and you were like "Nope."

And then I'm standing there...

Yeah, I was there.
And I never said "nope."

I don't say "nope."

And maybe I just wasn't
ready to talk about it.

And now you are.

I am. Are you?

I was ready before.

Okay, so go.

Me go? Why me go?

Because I said it first.

Okay, fine. You know what?
I will be the mature one here.

I got the sense...

...that you were experiencing some
attraction for me in that last exercise.

Oh my God, me?

What about you, little miss
gazing into my eyes?

I was not gazing into your eyes.

Oh, you so gazed.

Ok, fine, you know what?

I'll admit to gazing
if you will concede

that there was some attraction.

I will concede to some attraction
if you admit that you had feelings.

So I'm admitting to gazing
and to feeling?

Oh, for fuck's sake!

Ok, fine, you know what,
there were feelings, maybe.

And maybe I felt
some feelings, too.

Yeah? 'Cause it really would
have been nice to know that.

You know, I am standing there
with Tommy and the plunger,

thinking I'm going crazy,

and I'm going to turn fifty and
end up married to my mechanic.

Wait, what? Who's Tommy?

That's not the point.

You know, we are working through
some serious shit here, Kat,

and you just ran off.

I didn't run. I walked.

And maybe I needed
some time to process.

Yeah, well good for you.

But there were two of
us in that exercise, Kat.

It can't always
just be about you.

Come on you guys,
we're going to be late.

SUZIE:
Be with you in a few!

Let's do this.

So, Chloe,

what I'd like you to do is
discuss an issue that you feel

either is ongoing, or perhaps
needs to be resolved in a way

that is constructive
instead of destructive.

There are so many
to choose from.

Now Scott, remember,
no interrupting.

Ok.

If Chloe says anything
that is a trigger,

just write it on a post-it,
and place it on her.

For example, if you think your
partner is name-calling,

just write "name-calling"
and throw that post-it on her.

It lets your partner
share without having to edit.

Okay, great.

Two weeks ago, I'm making
a turkey for my in-laws,

meaning your family,

and I'm a little stressed out,

because your family
can be a lot to take.

I go to baste the turkey

and this guy thinks that
it would be hilarious

to shove a beer can up its ass

and stand it up on
its little hind legs

so it looked like it
was running away.

BOB:
Chloe, does this happen often?

Sort of. You know.
Or stuff like it.

It's not always the poultry.

Why don't you address
Scott directly.

Not a problem, Bob.

You stood him up,

put little cauliflower
sneakers on him,

and a head of
broccoli for hair.


Oh. Oh, so funny, huh?
Who does that?

It is kind of funny.

The turkey did not
cook properly

because you had to
be Mr. Funny Guy.

And you know what?

It also scared
the crap out of me.

A running turkey in the oven
is a very freaky thing.

You burned the top of my turkey
and we had to order Chinese food.

I apologized...
Aaaah! No talking!

And you were laughing
the entire way

through your apology,
so it doesn't even count.

There, I'm done.

And you interrupted.

BOB:
Scott, why don't you

tell us your side
of this event.

Alright.

Chloe, honey, I love you,

but you can really get stressed
out over small things

SCOTT:
Someti... what?

CHLOE:

When I saw how upset you
got over my work of art, I di...

What? What?

I did apologize.

SCOTT:
Really?

SCOTT:
Bullshit?

If it makes you feel any better,

I did the same exact thing
to my mom in the 8th grade.


What?

What is this?
What does this say?

Mother lover.


I'm not comparing you
to my mother, ok.

It's just that she
thought it was funny.

I wasn't trying to be
an asshole.

I was just trying
to make you laugh.

SCOTT:
I love hearing you laugh.

And to be fair,

you make me the butt
of your joke almost daily,

and I don't hold it against you.

Chloe, would you like
to respond to that?

I just would like it

if you could meet me in the
middle every once in a while.

And keep your hands off
my turkey.

Ok. Deal.


BOB:
Wow...

[LAUGHTER INCREASES]

Not exactly the exercise,
but well done.

Alright, who'd like to go next...

We'll go.

Great!

So, ladies, what's an issue...

...that represents a road block
on your highway to true intimacy?

I'll start.

As we've discussed many times before,
you have some real issues with boundaries,

and you are constantly
crossing mine

and not worrying about
how that makes me feel.

For example, on my birthday,
you took my massage gift certificate.

But you hate massages...

Uh-uh. No talking.

Now, I don't like massages, but it
would have been nice to have been asked.

Oh, and she took
my coasters too.

It really shows up when there's
something that we need to talk about,

something that maybe you're ready
to talk about, but I'm not ready to,

because maybe sometimes
I need time to process things

before I'm ready to talk
about them,

and I don't feel
that you respect that.

That's it.

SAM:
Wow.

Wow.

Funny,

in all the times
we've talked about this,

it's as if it's the first time
I've heard you say it.

So it feels pretty new to me.

Um,

I am glad to give you the time
you need to process things,

as long as you let me know
that I'm not the only one

who thinks that there
is something to talk about.

I can wait to talk about something
as long as I know that you know

that there is something
to talk about.

So that I am not sitting
in a room

thinking that I'm the only one
who thinks that there's something

pretty huge that
we need to talk about.

And you used to think it was funny
when I took your birthday presents.

Kat, would you like to...
Sure.

There are a lot of things
that were funny before

that maybe wouldn't
be so funny now.

Like the fact that you
flirt to get attention.

Just saying.
Mmm.

SAM:
I can see that.

I can also see that certain things
that didn't bother me before

may be a factor now.

SAM: Like the way you tend
to withdraw,

and go into your man cave.

Your lesbian man cave.

My what? I don't have
a lesbian man cave.

BOB: So, let's see what
we have so far.

The good news is, the only
post-it we have is on Kat.

Kat,

Samantha feels you have
a tendency to wootfuh

when it comes to
discussing issues

pertaining to your partner.

BOB:
You may want to look into that.

Yes, I mean, even though I have no
idea what the actual issue is here,

I do recognize the push-pull
that often happens

when one partner feels inundated

and the other partner
feels abandoned.

Ladies,

I think I want you to do
exercise 16 B.


BOB: We don't assign this
to everyone,

but I think you really need it.


I never realized the crying
bothered you so much.

Well, it does.

SUZIE:
Oh come on honey, come on.

SUZIE:
Hug it out. Come on, come on.

That's a boy.

Great work everyone.

This went a little long,

so we're going to skip the break
and go straight to dinner.

Thank you.
Thanks.

Can we please talk
for a few minutes?

That's fine.

Let's go tell Bob.
Great.

Hey, Bob,

Kat's having a little
bit of diarrhea,

so we're going to head back
to the room for a spell.

You know, just start without us.

Yeah, Kat, you know, this work can
be really upsetting to the system,

so you go ahead
and take care of your business.

Thanks Bob.


Oh my God, your face.

Did he just really tell me
to take care of my business?

He did. It's so good.

Oh my God.

Okay,

I don't want this
to be weird, so...

Agreed.

What is going on here?
I honestly don't know.

Are we starting to have
feelings for each other?

Or have we been pretending to
have feelings for each other,

and so now we think we
have feelings for each other?

Well do you think what
Jacqueline said is true?

That attraction can grow out
of trust? Just like that?

Maybe.

Like some kind of virus?

Really?

No, I'm just saying, if that,

if that was true,

if you could choose who
you were attracted to,

there's a lot of guys that
would've been off my list.

Yeah, me too.

Ok. Just for the sake
of argument,

if we were attracted
to each other,

and did decide to try it out,
do you ever think how weird that would be?

How so?

In the whole, you know,
"Oh, that's a vagina" way?

[NERVOUS CHUCKLE]

No, I guess it would be just,

you know, like your
first time with a guy.

It starts with a kiss
and then goes from there.

Well,

do you think we should try it?
Just to see?

See what?

If there's something there.

And if there is?

Oh.

Exactly.

Well, if there is something there,
that would be a good thing, wouldn't it?

I guess.

I don't know Sam,
you are my best friend.

We work so well as friends.
Do we really want to jeopardize that?

You're right.

Although it

would be great to have a best friend
that you were also attracted to...

But...
But...

...if it fell apart,
that would suck.

And let's face it,
with our track record...

No bueno.
No bueno.

[NERVOUS CHUCKLE]

Alright. Dinner?
Yeah.

Did we just break up?

Oh we did.

Whoa...

You have a vagina.

Shit, so do you.

Okay this is crazy.
What are we doing?

I don't know.

[KNOCK AT DOOR]

Who the fuck is that?

How am I supposed to know?

Samantha? It's Tom.

It's Tom!

Hey.
Hi.

Bob said your girlfriend
wasn't feeling too well.

I thought you might need this.

Jesus Christ.
Oh, right.

Faulty plumbing. Thanks.

I know you're a little shy
about it, but I'm happy to...

That was Tom. Tommy.

Oh.

So.

So.

Ready for dinner?

Are you serious?

Everyone's at dinner.

But, we just made out.

Yeah, and I'm hungry.

Kat, we've been best
fucking friends for ten years

and ten seconds ago
we were making out.

You don't think we
should talk about that?

No, not really.

Ok, um, did you learn anything
in that last exercise?

KAT:
Did you?

Maybe I need to go to
my lesbian man cave.

What is going on with you?

Listen, this is not a good idea.

I don't want to fall into
that thing that you do.

That thing that I do?

Sam, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

KAT: This is just you wanting
to feel wanted

and I happen to be
the one that's here.

But don't forget, we are
pretending to be a couple.

Ok, slow your roll.
Are you serious?

SAM:
So when you kissed me...

No, I didn't kiss you,
you kissed me.

Oh for fuck sake.

So when we kissed, that was you
pretending to be a couple?

Because guess what Kat,
there's no one here watching you.

You know what?
I'm going to go for a walk.

No you're not,
we're going to talk about this.

There's nothing to talk about.

Oh my God, you would be impossible
to be in a relationship with.

Oh, me and everybody
else you've ever dated.

And and there she goes,
like fucking clockwork.

You know what, don't forget,
I know you, Kat.

And you are freaking out because
you can't hide like you normally do

and that scares
the shit out of you.

No, what scares
the shit out of me

is how you can confuse one
kiss with having feelings.

I know you too, Sam.

You know what? Maybe you
should've said yes to Ray

because you'll be lucky if an offer
like that comes your way again.

Yeah, well at least I have
the guts to be alone.

You can't be five minutes
without a man to validate you.

And when they stop paying attention,
you just jump to the next one.

Jesus, you should come
with an expiration date.

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

Hey.

Hey!

You know what?
You're one to talk!

You think you're so
good at relationships?

That's just because
you're rarely in one!

Let me fill you in
on something, Kat.

You are not picky, you are just the
biggest chicken shit I have ever met.

So just go keep lying
to yourself.

Oh, I'm lying to myself?
What about you, Sam?

You're not looking for love,

you are looking for some man to convince
you that you're worth something.

Well, you know
what? You're not.

Oh, pot, kettle,
fucking black my friend.

You know what,
you are so screwed up

you couldn't even handle
faking intimacy for one day.

Oh my God, what about you, Sam?

You are so desperate
for attention,

you found a way to turn our fake
relationship into something.

Well, you know what, pal,
not interested.

Ha! You're not interested?

No.
You know what?

I'm not interested!

If I was gonna be with a woman,

it wouldn't be with one
who was such a dick!

Speaking of dick, I am surprised you
haven't found a gardener to hit on yet!

Yeah? Well, maybe I will.

Maybe I'm gonna go find Tom
and screw his brains out,

while you go home and feel nice and
smug because you said no to Ray.

But you know what?

One of these days you are going to
realize that it is all just an excuse.

You wouldn't recognize love if
it hit you in your stupid face!

Have fun screwing whoever!

Good luck, asshole!

Oh, fuck me.

Hey guys. Dinner good?

You know what? I'm uh, I'm not
really hungry, so I'm just gonna...

Oh fuck.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

JACQUELINE:
Samantha?

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

JACQUELINE:
It's Jacqueline.

Come in.

I know. I know.

I am so sorry.

I have no idea
what just happened.

We just came up here to relax and then
we did all your stupid exercises and

suddenly everything
just got weird.

And we started thinking we might
have feelings for each other.

And then we kissed. Yeah.

And then Tommy came with the
plunger and everything fell to shit,

and I am

pretty sure I just
lost my best friend.

And I don't even know
why I'm telling you this,

'cause you probably
think we're big fat liars.

But I am really sorry. And I
never meant to hurt anybody.

And I'm just gonna call a cab
and head home tonight.

No, you won't.

You owe all those other
people out there an apology.

As well as a chance to let you know how this
little charade might have affected them.

They deserve that much,
don't you think?

Oh, and Samantha?

I wonder whether you and Katherine
would have had that fight

if you hadn't tapped into
some real feelings.

Just a thought.

Yeah. You good luck asshole.

[KEYS JANGLING]

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Hi everyone.

Um, I'm sure you're all

a little disgusted with us,
with, with me,

and I don't blame you.

I stayed up most of the night trying to
figure out what to say to all of you,

but the truth is, nothing I can
say is gonna make this alright, so,

I just wanna tell you that

while Kat and I are not
really in a relationship,

everything else we said to you
was true.

Except, Kat doesn't really
have social anxiety disorder,

and I'm not really a nympho.

Anyway I, um,
I truly am sorry, and

I know Kat would be too

if she hadn't taken the car
and left me here all by myself.

Well, Suze and I
were disappointed.

But we understand that sometimes
good people do bad things.

CHLOE:
I'm not buying it.

I've had fights with my friends

and they never look like what went
on between you two last night.

No. No, that was just...

Ok, um, there was a moment when
Kat and I thought that maybe

we were attracted to each other,
which is just ridiculous.

Why is that ridiculous?

Because she's Kat, you know?
She's my best friend.

I don't see the problem. Isn't
that what we're all looking for?

I'm so turned on right now.

JACQUELINE:
Samantha, it took courage

to stand here and apologize.

And I think we all appreciate,
if nothing else, you making amends.

Um, uh, wait a second. I have
something I'd like to say.

You know, Jonah and I came
here for a very serious reason.

This weekend had
a lot of meaning for us.

JONAH:
And the worst part of it.

We actually like you guys.

I mean, did you think you'd come and
have some laughs at the pathetic couples?

J.K.:
Well guess what?

We are those pathetic couples


J.K.: And some of us
really needed to be here.

Not in some theoretical way, but

actually really needed

to work things out to be better
parents to our future child.

J.K.:
And you wasted our time.

I find that very hard
to forgive.

J.K., Jonah,

the truth is,

I did think we'd end up
laughing at you.

SAM:
I thought that you were all

gonna be a little ridiculous.

And I, uh, I couldn't have
been further from the truth.

JONAH:
Holy hell,

you look like shit.

I know. I was up all night,
I just told you.

No, I think he means me.

Oh Jesus.

Hi.
Hi.

I came back.

I see that.

KAT:
Um,

okay. Everybody, I want
to apologize for lying.

Uh, Sam and I are
not in a relationship...

They know everything.

Oh. Ok. Great.

I wanted to... did you tell them I
don't have social anxiety disorder?

Yes.
Ok.

Um, listen, I have

no idea what's going on
between us, but I

took off last night because

I was scared to find out. And,

when we kissed, I think that I...

Now they know everything.

Look, I don't know what kind of Jedi
mind trick happened this weekend, but

Something hit me
as I was driving here.

KAT:
You were right.

I am a chicken shit.

Every relationship I'm in,
I keep a certain amount of distance,

and that way when it ends,
it doesn't hurt too badly.

But I realized that I don't
do that with friends,

because there is no end date
in friendships.

And I don't ever think for a second that you
and I won't be in each others' lives forever.

I mean, you're my best friend.

And look, there's a lot of reasons
that this might not work out. I mean,

I mean, I'm still a closed off mess,
you're still an attention whore.

And...

I guess I should be freaked out
about the fact that you're a woman,

but I'm not.

For the first time in my life,
I want what you all have.

KAT:
I want to at least try.

With you.

KAT:
I think.

Wow.

KAT:
I'm sorry...

I just went all Jerry Maguire
and you respond with "Wow"?

I'm processing. You're not
the only one who processes.

SAM:
Ok, just listen.

There was some truth
to what you said about me too.

I do jump from relationship
to relationship, and I,

I know it looks like I just
want the attention, but

I do want more than that.

The only thing I know
after this fucking weekend

is that I like the day to day
with you.

And I never get bored with you.

And truthfully, it,

it broke my heart
when I thought I lost you.

SAM:
I have no idea what this thing

is between us, and,

to tell the truth, the stuff
that works between us as friends

could be disastrous
in a relationship.

I get it.

SAM: You have some real issues
around emotional withholding,

and I'm sure I have some issues that could
be difficult in a relationship too...

Yeah, like the fact that
you never shut up?

Or the fact that you're
a miserable bitch?

Look, if we want what they all have, then
we have to risk the other stuff too, and...

I'd be willing to try.
With you.

I think.

You think?
Really?

You said "I think."
Why is that ok?

Oh my god.
I don't believe this.

Oh my god.

BOB:
Ladies. May I say something?

Yeah.
Sure.

You talk too much.

BOB:
Just try it.

If there are problems, well,
we have another session in three weeks.

Hm.

You should go.

You.
You.

Shut up.
Shut up.

Let's hug it out.


Did we just...?
Yeah.

So, are we..?

I don't know. Are we?

Heads we do, tails we don't?

Huh. Ok.
