Preacher Rainey used to tell us

this old Bible story back in Macon:

"Satan tempts Jesus.

"This world and all of
its power I will give thee

if you worship me."

Now, all Jesus has to do

is just fall down on one knee.

But Jesus says,

"Satan, thou shalt worship
the Lord, thy God,

and in Him only
shalt thy serve."

You see, you got to worship God or Satan.

Ain't that always the choice?

â™ª Gonna tell Aunt Mary
'bout Uncle John â™ª

â™ª He claimed he had
the misery â™ª

â™ª But he having
a lot of fun â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby

â™ª Ye-e-ah, baby

â™ª Whoo-ooh-ooh, baby

â™ª Having me
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Ye-e-ah

â™ª Well, long tall Sally,
she's very sweet â™ª

â™ª She got everything
that Uncle John need â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby

â™ª Ye-e-ah, baby

â™ª Whoo-ooh-ooh, baby

â™ª Having me
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Ye-e-ah

â™ª Well, I saw Uncle John
with bald-headed Sally â™ª

â™ª He saw Aunt Mary coming

â™ª And he ducked back
in the alley â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby

â™ª Ye-e-ah, baby

â™ª Whoo-ooh-ooh, baby

â™ª Having me
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Ye-e-ah

â™ª Whoo

â™ª Oh, a big boy

â™ª Well, long tall Sally,
she's very sweet â™ª

â™ª She got everything
that Uncle John need â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby

â™ª Ye-e-ah, baby

â™ª Whoo-ooh-ooh, baby

â™ª Having me
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Ye-e-ah

â™ª We're gonna have
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Have some fun tonight

â™ª Whoo, have some fun
tonight... â™ª

Oh, my Lord.

Oh, my Lord.

Wow!

We want Little Richard!

We want Little Richard!

We want Little Richard!

We want Little Richard!

We want Little Richard!

We want Little Richard!

Where the hell is Richard?

Where's Richard?
I don't know.

Where the hell is our brother?

I don't know. I was
looking at the front.

You didn't see him?
No.

A man wearing a silver jacket
just can't disappear.

Come on.

We want Little Richard!

We want Little Richard!

There you are, Richard.

That was bad, big brother.

That was a bad scene last night.

You take off and there
damn near was a riot.

What's the matter, Richard?

You feeling all right, man?

I'm retiring.

Look...

That's... that's not funny.

I'm telling the truth, Robin.

Okay.

So, what does that mean, man?

It means I'm getting out.

God's given me more success
than any country boy

from a shotgun house could ever dream of.

He's been good to me.

Lord, He's been real good to me.

I just ain't that sure
I been that good to Him.

Why quit now, Richard?
I mean, you...

Why you gonna quit now?

He showed me a sign.

Like what?

Not that fireball.
It was a rocket.

A Russian rocket.
It was a sputnik.

It can be a Russian rocket
and a sign from God.

It can be both.

I saw that thing up there;
I saw it.

But I felt it here.

It was a rocket.

You can't just quit, all right?

Richard, we've been a year and a half

fighting to get to the top.

That's when you do it... when it counts.

Anybody can quit when they're failing.

Chuck is right.

You can't just... just walk

away from this;
you invented this.

You are rock and roll.

Now, you want to throw all that away?

Yeah.

Yeah, just as easy as I do this.

Richard!

That ring cost ten grand!

I won't need it anymore
'cause I'm going home.

â™ª Beans and cornbread

â™ª Beans and cornbread...

Here, try this one, Richard.

Whoo, it's so hot!
It's so hot!

There is nothing like a little
rose water on a warm day.

I'm going to pee in my pants

I swear.

Child, no. My, my, my, no.

More powder, more Westport powder.

Richard, you are too...

Richard!

Richard.

Boy, come here!

Richard!

Come on, you better get
your butt back in here, boy.

Come... no, no, no!

Let me go! Let go!

Take this nonsense off your head.

What's the matter with you?!

Richard! Marquette,
get me my strap.

He's going to kill you, Richard!

Ooh, it's so hot.

Lord, it sure is some time to be
a seamstress in Macon, Georg...

Hey, hey, hey!

Richard boy, what have you done now?

Nothing.

I'll take him.

No, no, not this time.

Bud, You beat this boy

every time he does something wrong,

you gonna kill him.

Now, you done whipped him
three times this week.

That's enough!

Eva Mae, the boy has dressed as a girl.

I can see.

Just got a little devil in him, that's all.

And I'll whip it out.

No, you won't whip it out of him!

Promise me, you're not gonna hit this boy.

I won't touch him.

Come on, Richard.

Good day, Mr. Penniman.

Won't Richard be taking
his piano lesson today?

No, Mrs. Clemens.

Richard will be getting
another lesson today.

...too many times over
and over again. Get up!

He's bigger than me.

Then you cut him down to your size.

I don't wanna.

Now, you listen to me, Richard Wayne.

You don't walk right

you don't talk right,
and it needs a fixin'.

See, man is a warrior.

You hear me?
A warrior.

And there ain't no way I'm
raising some sissy boy clown.

Now you get in there

and you mess that big
boy up good, all right?

Go get him.

Come on now, Richard.

All right now,

get in there, Richard, jab.

Jab.

Jab.

Jab!

Get your guard up, boy.

Stay in there, Richard!

No, th-that ain't nothing.

Nothing. You never taste
your own blood before?

You get back in there and you hit him!

You go get him bloody, go!

Okay, just easy up on the boy, Bud.

This is a boxing match;
it ain't baseball.

Now, you don't tell me
how to talk to my own son.

You get in there and you make him hurt!

Richard, get the guard up, boy.

Richard!

You get in there

and you hurt him!

â™ª Black-eyed peas
and the burnt-up greens â™ª

â™ª Bushel of corn and the
collard green, honey â™ª

â™ª Juno potatoes
and red ripe tomatoes â™ª

â™ª This stuff 'bout to
drive me crazy, honey â™ª

â™ª Black-eyed peas
and the burnt-up greens â™ª

â™ª Bushel of corn and the
collard greens and honey... â™ª

Take your time.

â™ª Every time I feel a spirit
moving in my heart â™ª

â™ª I will pray

Yes!

â™ª Said every time
I feel a spirit â™ª

â™ª Mo-o-o-o-ving

â™ª In my heart

â™ª I-I will pra-a-a-ay

Yes, Lord, yes, Lord, yes, Lord.

Thank you very much,

Brother Richard Penniman

for that fine rendition.

Now, today's sermon
is going to be about a subject

that a whole lot of you are familiar with.

Namely, the Devil.

Any time that you think

the Devil is getting ahead, you...

you know what you say?

You say,
"Get behind me, Satan."

Yes, that's so right.

"Get behind me..."

We're real proud of him, Reverend.

Hmm-hmm.
He sings everywhere.

We can barely contain this boy.

Here he is.
Richard.

Richard, you know what?

There's the Lord's music

and then there's the Devil's music.

Yes, sir.

But a voice like yours

should be used in the service of the Lord.

Yes, sir, I do know that.

Hallelujah.
I do.

All right, come on home.

We going to get supper
on the table, Reverend.

All right, Ms. Penniman.

Come on, baby.

Choo-choo-choo-choo

Choo-choo-choo-choo

Choo-choo-choo-choo

Choo-choo-choo-choo

Choo-choo-choo-choo

Choo-choo-choo-choo

Choo-choo!

If you make me come up there

I'm gonna beat you silly.

Choo-choo-choo

Hoo-hoo!

Robert, Richard, Marquette, get up.

Get your clothes.
I need you.

Marquette, hand me a can.

Richard, for heaven's sake,
keep the light over here.

Why can't we just...
dig a big hole

and bury the lot?

Because the government men

poke sticks in the dirt for holes

but they never poke a garden patch.

Well, why is that?

Because this is Georgia,

and... collard greens
are sacred.

Well, what happens in the winter

when there ain't no more collard greens?

Pumpkins.

After pumpkins?

Potatoes.

After that?
"After that?"

After that, with God's blessing

I'll have my own place.

The Tip In Inn, that's what I'll call it.

I'm not planning on laying brick

and burying cheap corn liquor
forever, no sir-ree.

Got to have a plan.

Got to have a dream.

Y'all got to have dreams.

When I get older,
I want to own a club, too.

Well, I'm gonna be a preacher

just like Brother Joe May,

the singing evangelist
thunderbolt from the west.

You can't be a preacher.

You got too much devil in you.

Ah-ah, I don't know.

A lot of good preachers got
a bit of the devil in them...

even your granddaddy,

and he was a fine preacher.

Reverend Rainey?

Reverend Rainey?

Reverend Rainey?

Lord, I need to confess.

I did a terrible thing.

It was me that wrapped the dog doo

in that pretty red paper
with the flowers on it

and sent it to Miss Grady
as a birthday present.

Maybe it's the devil in me...

and he's been making me think thoughts...

about sex...

and all...

I guess you know all that...

and I feel bad, Lord,
but I still think them...

and I know this isn't right
for a future preacher and all.

So, that's why I'm asking you
for a sign or something

or some strength
to help me mend my sorry ways.

Who's there?

Lord almighty.

Devil, get behind me.
Devil, get behind me.

â™ª Big leg girl

â™ª Walk my way

â™ª Big leg girl

â™ª What I say?

Whoo!

Richard Penniman!

It's blasphemy, is what it is!

The boy entered the house of God
and desecrated it!

In all of my 30 years

I have never seen such an insult
to the good Lord!

It's as if he said,
"Well, come on in, Devil!

Come on in
and just sit a while!"

We understand, minister.
We understand.

Do you?

Because this is sin with a capital S!

The boy will be punished.

When I'm through with him, preacher...

he'll wish he had never ever saw a piano,

and if I ever hear
about him playing one again

I'll make him wish he had
never been born at all.

I know it was wrong for him
to be playing them songs,

but you can't beat that out of him.

You can't beat that out of the boy.

Eva Mae, Eva Mae,
it's not just this incident!

Not that I think this is
insignificant, preacher

but it's everything about the boy...

the way he talks, the way he walks.

A father's joy...

is watching his sons grow into men

good and strong and make-make one proud

but it's clear as the blue sky

Richard's not gonna grow into anything

but an embarrassment.

I feel ashamed

every time I look at him.

I wish he was no son of mine.

He's your son, Bud.

Stop it, Eva Mae.

No, Eva Mae's right.

You can't give up on your son.

God forgive me but it's true.

You promised me
you wouldn't beat him no more...

It's your fault for this

'cause you stopped me when I had a plan...

Where you going, Richard?

I'm done with this.

Fried chicken's coming right up.

Hey, Agnes, got that pecan pie for me?

I got it, Doris.

Doris?
I didn't forget about you.

â™ª I got a ticket,
little baby â™ª

â™ª I got a ticket,
little baby â™ª

â™ª I got a ticket,
little baby â™ª

â™ª And everybody
wants 'em now â™ª

Ow!

Ooh, child, you gonna get it now.

No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.

No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

Doris, Richard, y'all quit clowning around.

Doris, your order's up.

You better take out
that garbage, Mr. Penniman

before you get fired.

I ain't breaking my back moving this piano.

Okay, nice and slow, here we go.

Let's get a little lunch, man.

All right.
I'm ready.

Hey! Hey!

What you doing with my piano, boy?

I'm just admiring your fine piano, sir.

You a player?

I'm the best piano player in the country

and the best singer in the state.

Oh, really?
Well, slay me.

â™ª Caledonia

â™ª Caledonia

â™ª What makes your big head
so hard? â™ª

â™ª Ow!

How's that for you, sir?

What's your name, boy?

Richard Penniman.

How would you like a job, Richard Penniman?

I'm Sugarfoot Sam.

It's for my show.

Mr. Sam,
what kind of show is it?

Um... sort of
vaudeville-like, yeah.

You know vaudeville.

Go ahead on, and put on

Look at my boys.

Aw, Robert, you're so handsome.

He's so handsome.

Hey, Bud, come on in.

Look at these boys.

Bud, why ain't you dressed?

I'm not going.

What you mean you ain't going, Bud?

Well, I ain't going... watch that boy

make a public fool of himself on stage.

Nope, no need to watch that at all.

Besides, I... got to go down
and check on my place.

I thought you said Thomas was watching it.

Yeah.

Well...

Thomas can't do everything.

â™ª Yeah, I'm going down
to my rockin' â™ª

â™ª I'm rockin',
rockin' all the way â™ª

â™ª I'm dead, you know,
I'm rockin' â™ª

â™ª Yeah, rockin'

â™ª Yeah, rockin', you know,
that's what I mean â™ª

â™ª Well, now, my baby,

â™ª Yeah, rockin'

â™ª Yeah, my money, you know

Oh, baby, we're so happy for you.

How's it feel being up there

Ma, I got to tell you, boy,

singing in front of all them people,

whoo, it's like a whole
'nother world for me out there.

Hm-mm.

Yeah, I guess.

I guess you noticed your
daddy couldn't make it.

Yeah.

Well, he wanted to,

but he had to deal with his place.

You know there's always so much to do

when you own your own place.

What's it called, Ma?

He called it
"The Tip In Inn."

I know the dog is not dead.

The dog jumped up...

James!

James Leroy, what you doing?

They're playing my song.

People are in here now.

No, no, no... now you stop that.

â™ª If this is love...

Hey, there, pretty lady...

Get your hands off me.

Get your hands off me!

Don't you act like that.

No, Bud!

James...

Don't push me, Bud.

Come on.
Get out!

I'm sorry about this, y'all.

Show's over.

Come on back inside.

Dear God...

Thank you for letting me sing.

I feel closer to you when I do.

And I want to be good.

I want to be better than good.

And I want to make lots of money.

Tons of it, so I can buy Mom a big house,

And I want to make Daddy proud of me.

Thank you.

Call me Billy.

Yes, Billy.

Billy, uh, there's a question
I want to ask you

that's just burning my inside.

What's that?

Where do I get a jacket like that?

With a jacket like this,
I'll be an instant success.

My public will demand it.

Oh, Richard, Richard, you're wrong, baby.

No jacket is the secret to success.

But I know what is.

Are you ready for the secret?

For that big secret to success?

What?

Pancake 31.

No.

Yes.

You wear makeup?

Oh, yeah.

Well, what do the girls think?

They think I'm a movie star.

You want to be a movie star?

Yeah.
Let me see what you got.

â™ª Every hour

â™ª Every hour in the day

â™ª Every hour

â™ª Every hour
in the day â™ª

â™ª Well, you know
I miss you, baby â™ª

â™ª Ever since you went away

Why haven't I heard you on the radio?

Where you been recording, Richard?

Recording?

I just got back to Macon.

Before that, I was living in a cotton field

just south of town.

Oh, now, see, that's a crime.

You need to be paid,

and you need to record.

Voice like yours need to be heard, baby.

Yeah, we gonna take care of that for you.

Leave that to Billy Wright.

You know this Pancake 31?

When I get through with you,

you're gonna look too pretty for words.

This is it, Richard.

Richard Penniman, are you ready?

All right.

"By The Light Of The Silvery Moon"

by someone called Little Richard Penniman.

How come they call you "little"?

You as tall as I am.

That's what's happening now.

Little Willie, Little Anthony

Little Richard.

It sounds like I'm famous already.

No.

Richard!

I want to talk to you.

Sit down.

How many records you expect to sell

before you make any money?

Well, my friend, Billy...

Billy Wright, he's a singer...

He says I shouldn't expect
to make much money off it.

How about singing the shows?

How much you make?

About...

30 buck a week?

How do you eat?

Barely.

I mean... I could make
a whole lot more, but

it's hard getting around to all the shows.

You lack mobility.

Yes, sir.

Mm-hmm.

Well...

we have to see if we can figure out

how to get you a car, then, won't we?

A car?

Yes, a car.

My own car?

A car to increase your mobility.

It's decided.

Come on, let's eat.

No, you got to get your own band.

That's where the money is.

Billy, I'm feeling too fine to listen.

Damn!

Well, this is the third time
it's done happened, now,

so just shut up.

Right, right.

So, just 'cause your daddy

does not make you King of the Blues.

You're listening to WAMZ

And the hits just keep on coming!

Ooh-wee!

Come on, now, Richard,

Now, just hold on a second.

Not like you see something

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

I'm sorry, but I just have
to say you are the most

amazing woman I have ever seen.

Why, thank you.

You look pretty amazing yourself.

Ooh, God bless you, child.

'Cause, you know, I do try, now.

I'm Richard Penniman,

but they call me Little Richard.

Lucille.

So, Richard, what's "little" about you?

Ooh-hoo-hoo!

You are a fresh one, ain't you?

And I like that.

Mmm.

I'm a singer.
Oh.

Yeah. So is my friend Billy

And after that,

Give me a second to think about it.

Let's go.

Mmm!

Little Richard, come on up here.

Ladies and gentlemen, Little Richard.

â™ª You know, the landlord
rang my front-door bell â™ª

â™ª I let it ring
for a long, long spell â™ª

â™ª I went to the window and I
peeked through the blind â™ª

Peggie, who did this?

James LeRoy.

They got the bastard over there.

We got to get him up out of here.

No one's allowed to touch the body.

I'm Richard Penniman.
This is my father.

Why's his body just laid out
here like this?

We want to bring him inside.

Can't till the coroner comes.

He'll be along soon.

And what about James LeRoy?

Y'all gonna give him the electric chair?

Electric chair?

We'll take him in,
but I wouldn't be surprised

if the D.A. don't dismiss
the whole case.

Why? He killed him, didn't he?

Two negroes get in a fight
and one kills the other...

just ain't much of a crime.

Can I talk to him?

Yeah, but not too long.

You kill my daddy?

Yes, I did.

I'm sorry.

Y-Y... Will you forgive me?

No.

I ain't never

gonna forgive you, James LeRoy.

Never.

Yes, it's our loss,

but you know what?

It's heaven's gain.

Because Brother Penniman,

he ain't feeling no pain.

You see, because Jesus
done wrapped him in glory

and placed him

in the Lord's unchanging hands.

God be with you, brother.

Until we meet again

let the church say...

Amen.

What we going to do, Richard?

It's gonna be all right, Ma.

I'm gonna take care of you.

I'm gonna take care of all of us.

â™ª Precious Lord

â™ª Take my hand

â™ª And

â™ª Lead me home

â™ª And help me

â™ª And help me to stay

â™ª Lord... Lord...

â™ª I'm tired

â™ª Lord

â™ª I'm weak

â™ª Lord

â™ª Lord, I want

â™ª Hear my cry

â™ª Lord... hear my

â™ª Hear my call

â™ª Oh...

â™ª Please

â™ª Don't let me fall

â™ª Pray, precious Lord

â™ª And lead

â™ª Lead me home

Grady. Grady Gaines.

Robinson. Baysee Robinson.

My name is Clifford Burke, thank you.

Chuck Connors.

Buster Douglas, baby.

Diamond. Lee Diamond.

Now, a good friend of mine, Henry Nash,

used to call me the upsetter.

That's why I named y'all The Upsetters.

All right.

Now, you ready to upset the world?

Oh, yeah!

Come on, then!

Specialty Records?

This is Little Richard,
from Macon, Georgia.

Yeah, may I speak to Bump Blackwell?

Oh, he is?

Well, um, do you know
whether he's heard my tape?

W-Well, have you heard it?

Specialty Records?

Yeah, did he get the tape?

Listen, that's okay.
I'll sing it to you.

It's starts with a strong bass line

and it's first
off with an "Ooh!"

There's nothing better than The Upsetters.

Did he get the tape?

Oh, you know who it is.

Okay, now this is foundation.

This is what we gonna
start off with, foundation.

I know Lee's got on some makeup.

We're gonna slick that hair down

like you got baby hair.

We gonna use lye.

Oh, man.
Lucille, this is hot!

It ain't that hot, it is not that hot.

See, if you going to be
the baddest band in the country

you need the hair
to go with it, so shut up!

â™ª Keep a knockin'
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª Keep a knockin' but
you can't come in â™ª

â™ª Keep a knockin'
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª Come back tomorrow night
and try it again â™ª

â™ª You said you love me
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª You said you love me but
you can't come in, whoo! â™ª

â™ª You said you love me
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª Come back tomorrow night
and try it again â™ª

â™ª Keep a knockin'
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª Keep a knockin'
but you can't... whooo! â™ª

â™ª Keep a knockin'
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª Come back tomorrow night
and try it again â™ª

â™ª You said you love me
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª You said you love me but
you can't come in â™ª

â™ª You said you love me
but you can't come in â™ª

â™ª Come back tomorrow night
and try it again â™ª

Ahhh!

This is Mr. Bump Blackwell.

And this is Miss Lucille.

So, Mr. Blackwell,

are you going to make our
Little Richard famous?

Excuse me, child.

I am already famous.

I meant to people

other than yourself.

Oh.

Richard, can I talk to you for a moment?

Yeah, of course.

Excuse us, Miss Lucille, thank you.

Well, Richard, as you know,

we are ready to get you
down into the studio

and record this record
in New Orleans on the 28th.

Well, I know now.

Yeah.

However, Mr. Rupe does not
want to use your band.

But you heard them, they're great.

Yeah, they are good,

but the musicians
in New Orleans are better.

We'll be using all the same boys

that cut all Fats Domino's records.

Lee Allen, Red Tyler,

Earl Palmer...

I mean, don't get no better than that.

Couldn't you talk to him?

I mean, I want to use my boys.

Richard, honestly,
I don't think it would help.

Specialty is going to sign me, right?

Well, that's
Mr. Rupe's decision.

But he will make that decision

after he hears the songs you record.

So do we have a date?

I'll be there.

Little Richie sure is purty.

Pretty hair, pretty mustache.

He's just pretty all over.

Would you look at this sissy fool?

Hi, y'all.

Mornin', Little Richie.

He's wearing makeup.

He's also wearing pink.

All right, Little Richard.

This is "Wondering," take one.

One, two...

â™ª I'm...

â™ª Wondering

â™ª Do you love me

â™ª Anymore

â™ª Oh, oh, oh, yeah

â™ª I'm wondering

â™ª Do you love me

â™ª Anymore

â™ª Whoa, yeah

â™ª If you love me

â™ª Like I love you

â™ª Then you'll make

â™ª All these dreams
come true â™ª

â™ª Now I'm wondering

â™ª Should I stay

â™ª All by myself

â™ª Oh, yeah

Fellas, that was great, let's take a break.

Richard, I want to
talk to you about the, uh...

Bump, you mean to tell me

you're wasting all your money on this one?

Man, my sister can sing
better than this, man.

Little Richie.

Sure wasn't no little session.

Got us sitting in here for three hours.

You okay?

I was terrible.

It was terrible, wasn't it?

No, man, it was great, it was great.

You were, you were just nervous.

Have a seat, have a seat.

You just gotta loosen up
a little more, you know?

Have a little more fun with it.

Just be yourself.

Okay?

â™ª Wop bop a loo bop
a good hot damn! â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti,
good booty â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti,
good booty, whoo! â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti,
good booty â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti,
good booty â™ª

â™ª If it don't fit,
don't force it â™ª

â™ª If you grease it,
make it easy, ow! â™ª

We have got to record that.

What?

Yeah, that.
That is a hit.

You're kidding me.
No, no, no.

We got to clean up the lyrics, though.

That's a definite... Dorothy, get in here!

But, wait a second, Bump.

This is going to be... Dorothy!

Come in, get in...

Come here, quick!

Get in here!
Yes?

Okay, look, Richard, Dorothy is a lyricist.

I want you to sing that song to her.

Dorothy, I need you to write me

a clean version of it in a half hour.

Okay?
But, Bump.

That song has some

terrible, terrible words.

Oh, trust me, she has heard it all.

It's true, I have.

â™ª Wop bop a loo bop,
a lop bam bam â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª A wop bop a loo bop
a lop bam boom! â™ª

â™ª I got a gal named Sue

â™ª She knows
just what to do â™ª

â™ª I got a gal named Sue

â™ª She knows
just what to do â™ª

â™ª She rocks to the east,
she rocks to the west â™ª

â™ª But she's the gal
that I love best â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy, whoo! â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª A wop bop a loo bop
a lop bam boom! â™ª

Child, what time you got?

Five minutes later than
the last time you asked.

What's taking him so long?

I look good in this pink, don't I?

Yes, baby, you look fabulous.

Hey, Richard, Richard!

Come over here!
Come on, child.

Take them right back and wash them.

Can't you wash some glasses?

They're not clean.

Richard, sorry I'm late.

Mr. Rupe, this
is Little Richard.

Richard, this
is Mr. Art Rupe.

I know who Art Rupe is... Specialty Records.

Hit maker extraordinaire,
coming down here to sign

the hottest artist out of Macon, Georgia.

Hotter than fish grease in the summertime

and prettier than a flower
in a flower shop.

How you doing?
I'm Little Richard.

Good to finally meet you, Richard.

Boy, that was one heck of a song
you recorded for us.

Oh, well, you know, I do try.

So, Richard, you want to sit down

and talk turkey with me?

And stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce...

anything you got... come on.

Richard, this is the standard deal...

the only deal I give to all my artists.

I pay for recording, the band,
for Bump to produce you.

I pay for the record to get
mastered, pressed and released.

When you go with your band on tour

and are worshipped by millions

I pay for the airlines, hotels, limos,

and grease for the fat union guys.

There's a royalty, which is
five percent of 90% of retail

not including a broadcast fee
which is calculated

on the amount of airplay a song receives,

which in your case will be plenty.

Any questions?

Yeah.

I am gonna make some money, right?

I think I can safely guarantee that.

The most important things
to understand, Richard,

are this contract is binding,

you are gonna be famous,

and the kids are gonna love that hair!

Whoo, I'm going to be

the specialty in Specialty Records.

You hear me?

When do we start?

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª A wop bop a loo bop
a lop bam boom! â™ª

â™ª I got a gal named Sue

â™ª She knows
just what to do â™ª

â™ª I got a gal named Sue

â™ª She knows
just what to do â™ª

Boo! Gotcha!

â™ª She rocks to the east,
she rocks to the west â™ª

â™ª But she's the gal
that I love best â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy, whoo! â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª A wop bop a loo bop...
Ow! â™ª

â™ª Yeah, tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh Rudy â™ª

â™ª A wop bop a loo bop
a lop bam boom! â™ª

Richard, maybe we should go wait outside.

Why?

Boy, you know why.
Come on.

And what is taking Bump so long?

Richard, Miss Lucille.
Hey, hey, hey.

They'll be down in a second

so we can go over to the radio station.

You two look good.
Look good.

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

â™ª Tutti frutti,
oh, Rudy â™ª

â™ª Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

â™ª A bop bop a-loom op
a lop bop bop â™ª

â™ª I got a gal...
What's that?

It sounds like Pat Boone
is covering your song.

Covering it?
He's killing it!

Ooh, when I see that white boy,
he gonna get his back dirty.

I'm hot! How come
that radio station's

not playing my record, huh?!

Richard, maybe you haven't noticed,

but you're not white,

and that is a white radio station.

At least Richard can sing.

Listen, look at it as a good thing.

I mean, Boone will cross the tune over

to all those audiences we can't get at.

We'll get a whole lot more exposure.

It's all right, honey.

At least you get to make some money.

A little.

What you mean, "a little"?!

That's my song!

Rupe owns the publishing company

that buys from his record company.

You get a half a cent per song.

What...?!
A half a cent?!

Whoever heard of cutting a penny in half!

Hey, you'll get no argument from me.

So what do I do now?

Nothing. You just
keep recording.

That's it?
Yes.

And-And you sing your songs
and you sing them right.

You make them so yours

that no one would dare copy them.

You understand?

All right.

Come on.

"Long, Tall Sally," take one.

â™ª Gonna tell Aunt Mary
'bout Uncle John â™ª

â™ª He claim he has the misery,
but he has a lotta fun â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby...

Cut, cut. Come on, Richard.

Pat Boone can sing
it that slow. Okay?

Let's go again.

"Long, Tall Sally," take two.

â™ª Gonna tell Aunt Mary
'bout Uncle John â™ª

â™ª He says he has the blues
but he has a lot of fun â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby

â™ª Yes, baby

â™ª Whoo, ooh, ooh,
ooh, baby â™ª

â™ª Having me
some fun tonight â™ª

I can do it fast.

â™ª Well,
long tall Sally, she â™ª

â™ª Been sweet, she got

â™ª Everything
that Uncle John need â™ª

-â™ª Oh, baby
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!

â™ª Yeah, baby

â™ª Whoo, ooh, ooh,
ooh, baby â™ª

â™ª Having me
some fun tonight, yeah â™ª

â™ª I saw Uncle John
with long tall Sally â™ª

â™ª He saw Mary coming and he
ducked back in the alley â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby

â™ª Yeah, baby

â™ª Whoo, ooh, ooh, ooh,
baby â™ª

â™ª Having me
some fun tonight, yeah â™ª

â™ª Well, I saw Uncle John
with bald-head Sally â™ª

â™ª He saw Mary coming and he
ducked back in the alley â™ª

â™ª Oh, baby

â™ª Yeah, baby

â™ª Whoo, baby

â™ª Havin' me some
fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Yeah

â™ª We're gonna have
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Have some fun tonight,
whoo â™ª

â™ª We're going to have
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Everything's all right

â™ª We're gonna
have some fun â™ª

â™ª Gonna have
some fun tonight

Can we do it again a little slower, please?

Don't peek, Mama.
Don't peek.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, Richard.

It's big, it's beautiful
and it is all yours, Mama.

Oh, baby.

Richard!

Richard, it's too big!

Oh! Oh, my God!

Baby, are there colored people

live in this neighborhood?

Joe Louis live right next door, Ma.

Ooh! Joe Louis!

Oh, my God...

Richard!

Richard, baby, look at this.

What, Mom?
You don't like it?

Oh, baby, it's fine.
It's fine.

I just feel, I...

I don't know.

Like it's too much house for just you?

Surprise!

What y'all doin' here?

Look, little Richard!

Richard, my man!

Gather your instruments,
pack your flash shoes,

kiss your girlfriends goodbye,

'cause Little Richard and the
Upsetters are going on tour.

Goin' on tour. Whoa!

Shut up.

â™ª I'm gonna rock it up

â™ª I'm gonna rip it up

â™ª I'm gonna shake it up

â™ª Gonna ball it up

â™ª I'm gonna knock it up...

This is me, me, me in concert.

Shut up.

â™ª ...but I don't care
if I spend my dough â™ª

â™ª 'Cause tonight I'm
gonna be one happy soul â™ª

â™ª I'm gonna rock it up

â™ª I'm gonna rip it up

â™ª I'm gonna shake it up

â™ª Gonna ball it up

â™ª I'm gonna rock it up

â™ª And ball tonight

Man, this changing
on the bus is getting tight.

What we need to do
is go talk to Henry Nash.

Robert, Henry ain't here.

Since you our manager now,
go tell the white boss man

that his darkies won't be
changing on the bus no more.

Yes, sir, Mr. Penniman.

I tells 'em straight.

We'll be using them warm changing rooms.

Oh, yeah, right.

No, but tell 'em
to expect some naked Negroes

on the premises.

Oh, that's bad, man, that's bad.

Yes, sir. Anything else
I should convey?

You want the boss man

to prepare y'all a little snack?

Say, some chicken?
Barbecue!

Well, if ain't too much trouble

I prefer champagne.

Champagne.

Miss Lucille, no trouble no trouble at all.

Any other requests?

Yeah, we tired of wearing
all this sissy-ass makeup.

Ri... Richard, I'm sorry

but, I mean, this stuff

just don't... just don't seem
to be bothering you

like it's bothering all the rest of us.

Being pretty ain't never bothered me.

Ain't that right, Lucille?

About the prettiest boy I've ever seen.

Now, sneaking in the back door
so white folks don't see us

till we on stage,

eating in a parking lot of some restaurant

I wouldn't even pay to eat
at the counter at...

Now, that bothers me.

Being called a sissy?

You looky here.

Them white kids?
They dancing to our music.

Okay? They may have Pat Boone
on their record player

in case their parents walk in

but they got my record
underneath their pillow.

You know this joint we playing here?

You know how many coloreds
have played here?

None. You know why?

'Cause they can't.

I am the first.

I am the only.

So if you want to call me sissy, go ahead.

Knock yourself out, boy.

But you make sure you call me a rich sissy.

And you do as I do,

you all gonna be rich sissies, too.

Now, where my eyeliner?

I want to be a rich sissy.

Give me that powder puff.

I like that.
Rich Sissy.

Now, we want a nice,
clean show, Mr. Richard.

This is not New York City.
This is Greenville,

and we have standards and decency here.

I'm sure you won't disappoint us.

A good, clean show, you said.

Good, clean entertainment.

You see, we don't want anyone
getting too excited now.

Hey, y'all.

Where's Richard?

I want to have a party with Richard.

Little Richard, I love you.

Yeah, I love you, too, baby.

I love you, baby.
Baby, I...

Henry! Henry Nash.

Hey, hey.

Come on, come on.

Tutti-frutti, baby.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Done had too much to drink, now.

Hey, Richard.
Sorry about that.

I just wanna have a party with Richard.

Richard.

I need a little money for the bartender.

Whatever you want, bro.

Go ahead. Help yourself.

Thank you.

Miss Lucille.

Lucille, child.

Why don't you go get
your king a glass of water.

As you wish, sire.

Yeah, and you, too, pretty boy.

Mmm... with all
them nice muscles.

Mmm. What's your name,
young princess?

Jesse.
Ooh, Jesse!

Where'd you get
all that pretty skin? Mmm!

Both of you look good.

Make my big toe just shoot up in my boot.

Mmm. Why don't y'all kiss
for Little Richard?

Come on.

It's for Little Richard.
Just a little.

Come on.

See you later, Richard.

Richard.

Hey, there, Bump.

Miss Lucille.

Bump Blackwell,
all the way from Los Angeles.

To what do I owe the honor?

You're up for a big Hollywood
movie... a Jane Mansfield flick.

Little Richard and Jane Mansfield.

Hmm. I like it.

Richard, can I talk to you for a minute?

Excuse me, child.

Maybe your daddy won't approve of you.

Look at this.

Richard, come here.

Good times...
tell me about it.

So what about this movie?

You know, it's a great deal, Richard

but I'm worried.

You see, these Hollywood boys
are a sensitive bunch,

and I don't think they're ready

for some out of control wild man.

Who says I'm out of control?

Mr. Jackson, Mr. Grant,
and Mr. Franklin.

Oh, what? You still
Mr. Rupe's errand boy?

He sent you down here
to go through my pockets?

That's my money.
That ain't Mr. Rupe's money.

This has nothing to do with Rupe.

This has everything to do with you.

Richard, you keep money in a suitcase,

and you gonna wake up
one morning without any.

And don't even get me started
about the IRS.

You are skating on a very thin edge.

Last night's concert was damn near a riot.

And now you've got this party

two beers and a light switch
away from being an orgy!

An all-out orgy!
With white women.

White women!

Man, have you forgotten
where the hell you are?

This is the South.

You think you're too big to be lynched?

Yes, I do.

Why? Because you have
a few hits?

No, 'cause I give people a chance to shout.

That's right, I am the genie
up out of the bottle

and I ain't going back in.

Richard, you are talking completely crazy.

Says who?
You ain't my father, Bump.

You can't stand there

and tell me what's crazy and what's not!

If I was your father,

I'd be whupping your hide right now.

But you ain't.
So you can go to hell.

Come on, baby, let's take a drive.

Come on.

Ooh-wee, Lord, look at them getting it on

like two pigs in a gunny sack.

Yeah, go get it now.

What's wrong with you?

I need more.

Just wait.

Okay? He look like he's
about to finish

and I want to see it.

Richard, you have this idea of me

that is not all true.

You think all I am is this.

This is Little Richard Weekend.

Well, honey...

you are all that.

With his new hit

"The Girl Can't Help It."

They're playing
our song, baby. Yeah!

â™ª Can't help it,
the girl can't help it â™ª

â™ª The girl can't help it,
she was born to please â™ª

â™ª Can't help it,
the girl can't help it â™ª

â™ª And she's got a figure
made to squeeze â™ª

â™ª Can't help it,
the girl can't help it â™ª

â™ª Won't you kindly
be aware â™ª

â™ª The girl can't help it,
the girl can't help it... â™ª

Richie...

What?

I love you.

And I love being with you.

I can't think of anything else better.

CHOURS; â™ª Can't help it,
the girl can't help it â™ª

â™ª The girl can't help it,
she was born to please â™ª

â™ª Can't help it,
the girl can't help it... â™ª

But I would be lying to myself

if I said I didn't want more.

More like what?

â™ª Won't you kindly
be aware â™ª

â™ª That I can't help it,
I can't help it... â™ª

Marriage maybe?

Isn't there some part of you
that wants that?

Yeah.

But...

baby, you know better than anybody

that there are other parts of me, too.

Do they matter so much?

I am what I am.

So am I.

Lucille...

Lucille.

Lucille!

Would you please take me home?

Please. I got money.
I'll pay you.

So, Richard, what's little about you?

â™ª Lucille

â™ª You won't do
your sister's will â™ª

â™ª Lucille

â™ª You won't do
your sister's will â™ª

â™ª She ran off
and married... â™ª

Look at me when I'm talking to you.

What are you doing?

â™ª Lucille...

That's the one, Richard!
That's the ring right there!

Ooh, child, that would not fit me.

â™ª Lucille, please come back
where you belong... â™ª

I will.

Like what?

â™ª I'll be good to you,
baby â™ª

â™ª Please don't
leave me alone â™ª

â™ª Ahh!

God's holy word.

Today's Holy Word brought to you by...

...natural energetic state.

Till the cows come home...

Jesus Christ has set us free.

Maybe you're finding it
difficult to believe

in your heart that your sin
has been forgiven.

Perhaps you're thinking

"I have lustful thoughts."

But the fact is

He has forgiven you.

You simply need

to claim His forgiveness

and believe His promise.

Psalms 103-11 says

"As far as the East

"is from the West

"so far as he removes

As far...

our transgressions from us."

as the East is from the West.

You've been listening
to the Reverend Grace...

Yeah.

Five Minutes to Live By.

Mom?

Mom?

Oh, brah.

How you doing, baby?

Oh, it sure is good to see you.

Look at you, Richard.

Ma, why you living up here
in this little room?

I'm comfortable here.

I take walks.

Walks?

Ma, this ain't a park.

It's a house.

Oh, quit your yelling.

I got everything I need here.

Everything.

I got all my things here

and all my memories.

But Ma...

Brah, you want a cup of coffee
or a cup of tea?

Ma, are you happy?

Happy about what?

Moving to Los Angeles.

Oh, child.

Don't worry about me.

It's just an adjustment, that's all.

You live your life one way,

and it's hard to change.

All I ever knew was Macon.

I miss my friends and some of my kin.

Of course I do.

Now I don't have no regrets now.

I don't have no regrets.

Now what about...

what about you, Richard?

Are you happy?

I don't know.

I should be.

Should be and being
are two different animals,

now, ain't they?

Yeah, I'd say so.

You always been uncommon, brah.

That short leg and your big old head.

You have a gift that moves people.

Make them feel what you're feeling.

But in the end

you got to do what's good for you.

You got to do what makes you happy.

I just don't know what that is.

Then you're gonna have to
find out now, ain't you?

I got one more question I need to ask you.

Tea or coffee?

Hello, sir.

My name is Brother Lucher.

I am a missionary

for the Church of God
of The Ten Commandments,

and I have a very simple question for you.

Have you heard the word of God today?

I know you.

Joe Lucher.

You was a musician when I was a kid.

You was famous.

Yeah, they used to call you
King of The Mambo, didn't they?

I gave it up to become an evangelist.

I run a mission and
a soup kitchen downtown.

Come on in, now.

Come on.

I'm going to Australia
on tour in a couple days.

And I'm worried.

What are you worried about?

It just don't feel right.

I know I'm tired and all,

but it just don't feel right no more.

What is it you want, Richard?

I want to be free.

I mean, sometimes
I just want to be totally free.

Everything's possible

with the grace of our Lord.

â™ª We're gonna have
some fun tonight â™ª

â™ª Have some fun tonight

â™ª Whoo

We want Little Richard,

we want Little Richard,
we want Little Richard...

You invented this.

You are rock 'n' roll.

You want to throw all that away?

Yeah, just as easy as I do this.

Richard!

...we want Little Richard,

we want little Richard...

All right, all right, all right.

Oh!

Now you ready to upset the world?

Oh, yeah!

Come on then.

Where do I get a jacket like that?

Are you ready for the secret of success,

Richard Penniman?

Pancake 31.

You lack mobility.

Yes, sir.

We have to figure out
how to get you a car...

My own car?

A car to increase your mobility.

It's decided.

You have a gift for moving people.

â™ª You got to praise Him

â™ª Come on, let's praise
Him and lift Him up â™ª

Yes!

-â™ª You got to praise Him
-â™ª Come on!

â™ª Come on,
let's praise Him â™ª

â™ª I want to praise His...

â™ª Name...
â™ª Name...

â™ª Name...
â™ª Name...

â™ª Name

â™ª Woo!

I want to thank the Preacher Rainey

for having me back today

for he threw me out of this very church.

Yes, I did. I did.

I feel very, very blessed today.

In so many ways, I feel as though

my life has come full circle.

Oh, forgiveness, it's a...

it's a wonderful thing.

Some of us is not as strong
as we want to be.

I killed your Pa,

and I ain't slept a wink since.

I'm sorry.

I repent.

I repent, and I beg your forgiveness.

Murder... is murder,
James LeRoy.

And it is wrong,

and I cannot forgive the act.

But in the grace of God...

I can forgive the man.

All right.

Yeah. Amen.

â™ª Ooh, ooh, ooh

â™ª Come on,
let's praise Him... â™ª

Hey, Bump, good to see you.

God bless you.

It's been a long time.

Been too long, Richard.

You know, I'm sorry we haven't talked.

You were good to me.

I didn't always realize that back then

but... you're a good man,

and I haven't forgotten.

Well, thank you.
I appreciate you saying that.

Oh, yeah, Richard.

This is Don Arden.

He's a promoter.

He has a proposition for you.

First, let me say, it's an enormous thrill.

I mean, I'm a huge fan.

You're the architect of rock 'n' roll,

and it's an honor to shake your hand.

Well, thank you very much,
and God bless you.

Well, thank you.

Listen, I'm setting up a tour

with Sam Cooke in England.

I'd like you to headline it.

Woo-wee.

Well, Mr. Arden, thank you.

But, you see, I don't sing
rock 'n' roll no more.

Well, I know you're a man of God,

but Father Lucher's soup
kitchen is in dire need.

With the kind of money
you'd earn on this tour,

you could feed a lot of hungry mouths.

And I can sing gospel?

You can sing gospel.

You can sing anything you want.

â™ª Now I want you

â™ª To sing me some lovin'

â™ª Send it I-I-I pray

â™ª How in the world

â™ª Can I love you

â™ª When you're
so, so, so far away? â™ª

â™ª Oh, my nights...

This is a disaster.

If Little Richard goes on after this

and plays his pretty little gospel tunes,

we're going to have a riot.

Don, relax, it'll be fine.

How can you be so sure?

Because there is no way

on God's green earth

that Little Richard is gonna allow

somebody like Sam Cooke to upstage him.

It'll never happen.

A man cannot change his nature.

â™ª And don't send it,
my dear... â™ª

But this guy is good.

â™ª I want so badly
to hold it â™ª

â™ª And I want to pretend
that you're near â™ª

â™ª Send me some lovin'

Fantastic.

Ladies and gentlemen...

Top that.

I killed 'em, man.
I killed 'em.

The one, the only...
Little Richard!

We love you, Richard!

The good Lord

has granted me...

many, many things

in my life.

He's granted me

the chance to see the error in my ways.

Come on, sing a song!

So I... Listen to me.

Come on, Richard, come on.

The Lord has changed my life,

and I have something to say.

Come on, Richard.

But the best thing the Lord...

ever...

Ever gave me...

is the beat.

The beat to move people.

He's had a heart attack.

Get a doctor.

Hey, is he all right?

â™ª Wop bomp a loo ma
a lop bam boom! â™ª

Two, three, four...

â™ª Good golly, Miss Molly!

â™ª She sure like to ball

â™ª Woo!
Good golly, Miss Molly! â™ª
