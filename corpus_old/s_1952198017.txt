Ah ha!

[ Ewoks screaming ]

[ laughs ]

Oh ho ho!

Boba's got himself a lightsaber now!

Oh ho ho ho ho!

Make it two!

Ooh, red and blue.

When l put it together, what does it make?

Purple rain!

Oh, ho, no, he's gettin' away!

What's this button here?

Says ''long-range missile.''

Couldn't possibly
-- could it?

[ laughs ]

Oh ho, and the quarterback is toast!

Oh, Boba!

Hey, hey, he got the girl.

What's with all the clothing?

Why don't you --
there's more comfortable.

Right on.

Oh, careful of the antenna, baby.

And that would be the most awesomest thing

to ever happen in the history of ever!

Can somebody get me a sock?

Yeah, l've got Vader on it.

Ugh. Just saying his name stresses my ass!

[ cell phone rings ]

ALFONSO: Uh-oh!

Yeah?

Turn your head for me, please.

You lost them?

Uh-oh!

l-l can't hold your hand anymore, Vader.

A hand l gave you, l might add!

No! No! Shut up!

Uh-oh!

l-l-l got to
put you on hold!

l just want to throw myself
in a hot bath and cry.

Oh, no!

You're looking for some guys?

What about a bounty hunter?

A what, now?

You know, a guy who
looks for a guy for money.

My sister's dating one.

Alfonso, you're a lifesaver!

What's your midichlorian count?

Seriously, what do we need to do?

We put an ad in the paper.

Bounty hunters from everywhere
are looking, looking, looking,

<i>l was a little busy thinking
about my entire family</i>

and the other 2 billion
people from Alderaan

who were just vaporized into
dust 'bout three hours ago.

[ beeping ]

Gary, where is Jessica?

lsn't today ''Take Your
Daughter to Work Day?''

(sighs ) No one actually does that.

Gary, you promised.

Keep your head down, Jessica!

Okay, daddy! Oh!

Mr. Fuzzybottom!

[ groans ]

Oh! Ugh!

Ahhh! Ahh!

[ panting ] Here you go, baby.

VADER: Who is this little girl?

Oh! Lord Vader!

Uh...it's ''Take Your
Daughter to Work Day, ''

and l know, uh -- you know,
l'm sorry for bringing her,

but my wife says l never see her,

and -- and let's be
honest. She's right.

Okay? She's right.

Do you have kids?

'Cause, l mean, they change your world.

Oh, l'm probably gonna get
fired for this, but [bleep] it.

l love my daughter.

That really hits me where l live.

What have you done with those plans?

Gary here never sees his daughter

because of people like you!

[ bones snap ]

l'm so sorry you had to see that.

Are you having fun, being
at work with your father?

Mmmm.

[ laughs ]

l know, l'm scary.

These aren't the droids you're looking for.

These aren't the droids we're looking for.

Yes, they are.

Move along.

Move along.

Daddy, you're not even trying!

Baby, it is 165 degrees on this planet!

l can't hear in this thing!

l was just repeating what l
thought the guy was saying!

lt's not like it's my own mother[bleep]
thought on the matter, okay?!

[ crying ]

Hon--
oh!

Baby!

See?

That's why l don't take my
daughter to jack [bleep].

Make her tell us the
location of the rebel base.

Good god, man!

l'm a doctor, not a savage!

This is a flu shot! Good day, sir!

You will
make her --

l said, ''good day, sir!''

What the...

You trying to drown that kid?

What are you injecting there?

ls this the bloody Dark Ages?!

Why don't you just throw
some leeches in there!

Oh, nobody listen to Dr. Ball.

He's just an old fool!

She's lost the will to live?!

What is your degree in, poetry?

You sorry bunch of hippies.

For god's sakes, don't
use the billions of dollars

of medical equipment around us.

Why don't we all just
get on our knees and pray?

We don't have knees, you mother[bleep].

Okay, kid, Mr. Ackbar here

is ready to take this ad
campaign coast to coast.

What have you come up with?

[ knuckles crack ]

' Ackbar's fish sticks from the sea '

' They cook so tender and flaky '

' Whip some up for you and me '

' To pass them up is a big mistakey '

' Yeah '

''Big mistakey''?

lt's a no, guys.

[ all groan ] What? That's nuts.

l think it works better
as an instrumental anyway.

There's one.

Set for stun.

Ugh!

He said stun.

[ crying ]

lt wasn't gonna hurt ya.

He said stun.

[ beeping ]

[ roars ]

[ screeches, gasps ]

[ beeping ]

[ alarm blaring ]

[ glug! glug! glug! glug! ]

Whoo!

Go to the Jedi Temple.

Do what must be done.

Mr. Skywalker.

What's going on?

All of you line up, oldest to youngest.

What for, sir?

Um...a treat.

[ excited chattering ]

Um...everyone just, uh,
close your eyes real tight

and put your fingers in your ears.

No peeking.

Mr. Skywalker, can my treat just be a hug?

You can do this, Anakin.

Just -- just go to
your happy place.

Oh, remember the fields of
Naboo, where you fell in love.

Yeah.

Yeah!

Oh, it's beautiful.

Oh, yeah!

Oh, nature!

l feel alive!

Oh, yeah!

Aah, hyah!

Oh, l'm so in love.

Aah, hyah!

Ra-a-a-r!

[ laughing ] Where are you going?

Come here.

Yeah!

Oh, yeah!

That was nice.

Anakin, l'm home!

ANAKlN: Oh, good.

l left you some fresh-cut
sunflowers on the dining table.

Oh, Anie, that is so sweet of you...

[ glass shatters ] [ screams ]

Our forces are almost in place.

[ engine revving ]

This is General Veers.

Begin your attack.

Yeeeee-haw!

What the hell are you doing?

Slow down.

Ow!

Ooh!

Here they come!

They're beautiful!

You just passed them.

You got to
tur-- look out!

[ AT-AT squealing ]

Yeah!

That was awesome!
That was fantastic!

Whoo-hoo!

General Veers, report on the attack.

Uh, uh...

Ha ha!

Whoo! l love this thing!

This is it, mom.

Everyone has a destiny, and
mine is just over that horizon.

Krayt, listen to reason.

The elders all say
it's just a never-ending

ocean of desert out there.

Oh, pishposh.

What kind of cruel god
would create a whole planet

defined by just one topographical feature?

Why, that'd be as
ridiculous as a whole world

made of nothing but ice, lava, or forest.

No, sometimes you just
have to dig deep down

inside yourself and
find the courage to say,

look out, world.

Here comes Krayt Dragon.

What is thy bidding, my master?

My bidding?

How about l bid thee
to stop ramming the ship

into [bleep] asteroid fields?

Can you handle that?

l'm trying.

Yeah? Well, there is no try.

There's do and there's [bleep]ing up royal.

And you are [bleep]ing up royal,

so l'm hiring bounty hunters to do the job.

But
l --

No buts. lt's already ringing.

You look so tiny down there,

like a little mean pepper shaker.

Sheila, hey, it's Palpatine.

Listen, l need you to place
an ad for me, will you?

lmperial Emperor seeking bounty hunters to,

um -- to find and
locate -- yeah,

l guess that is the same thing.

Okay, to locate the Millennium Falcon.

She's typing.

So all you see is my head, huh?

Can you see this?

Who-o-o-o-o-o-o-op!
Up!

Yes, l c--
No, l'm here.

Right.

Oh, and be sure to mention
some kind of a reward.

What? Oh, l don't know.

How much do you think?

Really? That seems a little high to me.

No, l see your point.

l tell you what, why don't we
just say ''substantial reward''

and leave it at that?

Okay, thanks, Sheila.

What?

[ sighs ] Sure. What's his name?

Dengar?

Sounds good.

Yeah, no, we'll bring him in first thing.

Okay. Okay, bye-bye.

Sheila's husband's a bounty hunter.

l told her we'd give him a look-see.

[ mechanical breathing ]

Bet that knee's starting to hurt.

ANNOUNCER: Sally Johnson is
a real person, not an actor,

so to tell her story, we hired
the star of ''Phantom Menace.''

l was driving down my street
when a truck hit me head-on.

Osa-noes!

There's a truck a-comin'!

Aaaah!

We's-a gonna die!

Yes.

l was fine, but the car was totaled.

Whoo-ee patootie!

lt's a mess!

Got the engine over here,

but the wheel for steerin' way over there!

Aah!

My agent at Gecko lnsurance
sent me a check right away.

You-sa not even gonna believe this.

Ja wheh.

We win da money.

We win da money!

Wha-aaaah! Whoa!

Um, l think l was explaining
it better than he was.

Gecko -- real
help. Real money.

Me-sa thinks me broke me bombad spine!

Did -- did
they say cut?

Bounty hunters?

We don't need their scum.

My brother's a bounty hunter, Gareth.

There will be a substantial reward

for whoever captures the Millennium Falcon.

ls he paying attention?

[ mechanical breathing ]

[ horn sounds, crowd cheering ]

Can't wait to get started, right, fellas?

Got to hunt that bounty,
but the bounty's in the hunt,

l always say.

Tricks of the trade,
trade secret --

disintegration devices.

D-guns, D-bombs,
D-missiles.

l'm the disintegration machine.

Want a guy disintegrated,
get me integrated.

That's Dengar's motto.

l want them alive.

No disintegrations.

As you wish.

Aw, shucks.

See you at the finish line, a-hole.

Where my keys?
Best bounty hunter in the league.

Better stop soft-shoeing boss.

We are bounty hunters!

l got to say, Boba, this
is one beauty of a ship.

l'm not crazy about the name, though.

l've made a deal that will keep the Empire

out of our affairs forever.

[ roars ]

We'd be honored if you could join us.

[ grumbling ]

[ slurping ]

C-can l get a little more water?

What?
Nothing!

[ clears throat ] l just
asked for more water.

Hmm?

Keek!

[ growls ]

Peow!

[ blowing ]

[ imitates creaking ]

[ growls ]

So, how we doing?

Leia, how's the soup?

You ever had soup this good?

Yes, on Alderaan.

Hey, Princess, let
it g-o-o-o-o-o-o.

''Oh, help me.

We're a peaceful planet.''

''You may fire when ready.''

Ka-bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-om!

Big laser.

[ imitates gunfire ]

Alderaan chunks everywhere.

Psheeeew!

Anyone, uh --
anyone got a joke?

l've got one.

Who's got two thumbs and
betrayed his best friend?

This guy!

[ laughs ]

Uh, too soon?

Well, it's been a time and a half.

But -- [ yawns ] lot
of torturing to do.

A-broo-boo-boo.

Do-de-da-le-do-do.

Aroooo!

Hi. Have you or someone you know

been permanently handicapped by a Jedi?

lf so, call me, Bob
Goldstein, at Naboo-5-SUE-JEDl.

l'll get you the money you deserve fast.

l have over 10 years experience,

and l'm ready to work for you.

At last we will have our revenge.

You call now.

l love you.

l know.

[ moans ]

That l did not know.

Leia and the Wookiee must
never again leave this city.

That was never a condition
of our arrangement,

nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter.

l have altered the deal.

Pray l don't alter it any further.

This deal's getting worse all the time.

Furthermore, l wish you to
wear this dress and bonnet.

This was never a condition
of our arrangement.

l have altered the deal.

Pray l don't alter it any further.

This deal's getting worse all the time.

Here is a unicycle.

You will ride it wherever you go.

What? l'm not riding no [bleep] unicycle!

l have altered the deal.

Pray l don't alter it any further.

This deal is getting worse all the time!

Also, you are to wear these clown shoes

and refer to yourself as Mary.

Oh [bleep] you, man!

l'm not doing it!

l have altered the deal.

Pray l don't alter it any further.

This deal...

is very fair, and l'm
happy to be a part of it.

[ shoe squeaks ]

Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy

as father and son.

Father and son?

Huh.

' Think of all the time we wasted '

' So many plans we never made '

Okay, don't let go.

Don't let go, dad.

Don't --
don't let go.

l'm doing it! Whoo!

l'm doing it!

l'm doing it!

Dad!

Yeah!

[ dance music plays ]

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

' Crack, jam, take it down, slam it '

' Pick it back up, but
don't forget to ram it '

' l make the rounds, then l double back '

' 'Cause l'm doubling twice around '

' l make the rounds, then l double back '

' 'Cause l'm doubling twice around '

' l make the rounds '

Father and son.

Wh-wh-aaaaah!

Aah!
What?

Oh, l said, aah, l can't
believe this apartment's

priced so low.

lt's got a washer and dryer, central air.

What does this do?

You know, l'm not quite sure.

Uh, garbage disposal?

Aaah!

Well, apparently it does nothing.

How's the cable in this place?

Crystal clear satellite TV.

Aah! Ugh!

[ scoffs ]

Cloud City.

More like Crap City if you ask me.

l'll have the calamari.

Well, l guess l'll have
the insensitive bitch,

with a side of [bleep] you.

Aaaaah!

Hello! Meant to do it.

Thank goodness.

l thought l was doing this

thousand years of digestion alone.

How did you fall in?

What? Fell in?

Ha ha! Volunteered, more like it.

You should've seen it.

<i>You would've dug it the most.</i>

l was flying around with my jet pack,

just smokin' rebels with my laser.

Ba-boom
ba-boom ba-boom.

Han Solo was all, ''hey, wait.''

And l'm like, ''oh, l've been waiting

for this for a long time, Solo.''

Ba-bang!

The big, bad Wookiee
be growling in hell now.

l even put one between Skywalker's eyes,

right between those pretty baby blues.

But then Jabba the Hutt was all,

''oh, no, this guy's too badass, man.''

So then 80 Jedi showed up.

l took out about 67 of them,

but then 20 dudes finally flanked me.

And l was like, ''you know what, kids?

lt's been real, daddy-o, but l'm
not giving you the pleasure.''

So l jumped into the pit myself.

On the way down, l was thinking,

maybe l should have left 'em a party favor.

Oh, l did -- a thermo
detonator right up their ass.

Ba-boom!

Oh, that's awesome.

At least you didn't go out like a punk.

Yeah.

Oh, 'cause l looked like a badass.

[ sniffles ]

[ sobbing ]

Are you crying?

No. Huh?

That's funny.

[ sniffles ]

Da-da-da
daaaaa-da.

Da-da-da
daaaaa-da.

l'm okay.

Welcome, my master.

The Death Star
construction --

Yeah, great. Fine. Whatever.

That flight was a [bleep] nightmare, man.

My stupid tray table broke,

and l ended up with a gallon
of coffee in my crotch.

lt's like dunking my wang in hot lava,

something you have some
experience with, l guess, huh?

Right?
Yes.

Ha ha!

ls that yours?

No, for the hundredth time,

that's that same stupid black bag.

Mine doesn't have a stripe.

lt's like that stripy bag is mocking me.


Well, my suitcase is gone.

Sacrificed to the airport gods.

Now l'm here for two [bleep]
weeks with one [bleep] robe.

All right, now it's sticking
to me like a wet Kleenex.

Wow, for real?

Yeah, guess l'll just
be killing myself, then.

Good chair, good chair.

Nice lumbar support.

Great view of...utter blackness.

[ air-conditioning humming ]

Oh, for -- l'm right under
the air-conditioning vent.

And the chair's bolted to the floor?

Who's the
brainiac --

Hey, Crayola, help me shut this vent.

Yeah, reach up there with
your Staff of Ra and --

[ air gusting ]

Hey, want to see me tempt fate?

Could this day get any worse?

l did it ironically, so l think l'm safe.

What are you doing? Put me down.

Aaaah!

[ chickens clucking ''Star Wars'' theme ]

Convene all ships on Endor.

l want the moon obliterated

and the Rebels wiped from
the face of the galaxy.

Sorry, sir.

Actually, we can't.

The Rebels have won.

What do you mean, they won?

We have tens of thousands of ships.

We -- we control
countless worlds. - Yeah.

We have millions of troops at our disposal.

But they just blew up the second Death Star

<i>and killed the Emperor.</i>

So?

So, that means they won.

How does that mean they won?

They blew up the first
Death Star years ago,

and the fighting continued.

Yes, but they didn't kill the Emperor.

They had to do both.

We can't fight back?

No. Sorry.

This is the end of the Empire.

Really?

Yeah, 'fraid so.

That's it, then.

What do we do now?

l guess we can go get a massage.

Let's do that.
