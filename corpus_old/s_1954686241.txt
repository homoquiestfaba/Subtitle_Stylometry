False King, God
has no mercy on you.

He shall fester you with boils
spawned by your many sins.

A child born in Israel will be
a far greater king than you.

He is born to destroy you
and those of your seed.

God's wrath has come upon you.

Agh!

Agh, agh, agh.

Agh!

Agh!

Agh!

Did you see him?

Did you see Isaiah?

Did you see him?

Did you see him?

Aahh.
Fa... father

...father it's me,
Antipas.

Antipas,

Wake the priests of the
Sanhedrin.

Very well father.

Now.

I will see them now.

Does your
majesty value truth?

For there is harsh
truth in your dream.

I will hear it.

To step beyond these
walls is to know King Herod

is despised.

The zealots denounce
you as a puppet.

Enthroned by the Roman Emperor

against the will of the Jewish
people.

Zealots cannot
enter my father's dreams.

Unless
endowed by sorcery.

Sorcery.

You did
not see Isaiah.

You saw a spectre, a figment.

Figment.

The creation
of a sorcerer's skill.

But through prayer
it can be vanquished.

You are a warrior king.

Your voice can make
a vapor of phantoms.

Yes.

A vapor.

Come to the temple.

Through prayer your strength
will grow ever greater.

Well done.

To vanquish phantoms he prays.

Whatever his faults,

a bond between the throne and
temple serves order.

And order serves the
preservation of our people.

Follow me...

Get down...

Greetings.

Greetings my...
Greetings sir.

Father, the nobles
who are served by these men

offer you gifts from the
land of the Hind.

What do they
say of their masters?

That they are
from beyond Parthia.

Wanting what of me?

They ask that you hear from their
own lips of their purpose.

Arrange
entertainments.

Majesty,

an alignment of the stars has
drawn us here.

These stars.

They foretell a great event.

A child.

Born in your kingdom is
the God of Israel's chosen.

The Messiah.

Messiah?

A King of
the Davidic line to restore

the glory of Israel, as in
the prophecy of Isaiah.

Isaiah.

G...!

Of all the infant boys in
my kingdom

how will you find this one child

destined to be the Messiah?

Knowledge
that the day and time

of his birth match the
position of the stars.

And the child will
give us a sign.

What a blessing.

Yes.

Find this child.

Send me news that I may
come and ... venerate him.

I welcome your holy mission.

Majesty.

Joseph?

What is it?

This
attention, adulation of our boy.

We must leave.

Leave? Why?

Herod.

No king allows a
rival to his throne.

But our home?
Enough!

I know what I feel.

You're leaving?

There's danger here.

Where will you go?

Wherever Herod is not.

Elizabeth,
pack our things.

We will go as well. Go on.

Our purpose was visiting your
cousin and now we have none.

On this day,

give no thought to what you do.

By King Herod's order, the
male babies, all of them!

You seven this way,
the rest with me.

In there.

You two there.

Is it a boy?

It's a girl!

Show me.

Please.

No.

Where are your children?

No. No. No. Aahh.

No. Aaagghh

Agh!

Please, I beg you,
don't kill my son.

AGH!

Who is there?

Antipas?

My heart.

Agh.

... Help me.

Agh.

Agh.

Agh.

Antipas, Anti.., Ant,
Antipas, Antipas...

You find comfort here
where your father once ruled.

Comfort.

Better said lament.

I too.

I married to be queen.

Tell me Antipas Tetrarch
of fair Galilee,

am I a fool for wanting more?

If so ...
we are both fools.

Promise I will someday
find you here not lamenting,

but ruling Jews, all Jews,
as your father ruled.

All powerful, not a
puppet of the Romans.

I will not rest until
I'm on this throne as King.

With you by my side.

Greetings.

The wheel of my cart has
broken on my way home.

I'm a trader from Jerusalem,
please, can you help me?

Jerusalem.

Shalom.
Shalom.

Some years back I heard
of old Herod's death.

Did his rule
pass to one of his sons?

No, no
son of Herod rules now.

Rome sends Governors to rule.

And there's order.

The Romans value that.

What has become
of the sons of Herod?

They
remain as Tetrarchs.

Each has limited rule over
a piece of the kingdom.

How is
life for the Jews?

One
gets heavily taxed.

But one gets by.

Here in this
land of dog headed gods,

I made great efforts teaching
my son our scripture,

dreaming he might become a man
in the land given off by God.

Perhaps it is time
to return, hmmm?

So this is the
Holy City of the Jews?

Why don't they hail
their new governor?

I don't come
seeking their love, Claudia,

only respect.

How do I dress when we
are taken to see the Jewish God?

No one sees him.

They believe he's everywhere.

Everywhere?

But cannot be seen?

How do they know he exists?

Maybe he doesn't.

Como on children...

Ah, he's here, Jesus.

Our cousin Elizabeth has not
seen you since you were

a baby in arms.

I've heard
so much about you.

Aha...

I'd given up hope, but a trader
spoke of a Joseph of Nazareth

who'd returned from afar.

I felt at once it
was your Joseph.

He brought us six
years before he died.

Then blessed be God.

He left you a life that's good.

Is John a priest in
the temple, like Zechariah?

My son, the Baptist,

he's not beloved of the
Temple, or they of him.

John found God in
the wilderness.

Like Isaiah.

Mmmm.

Talk prophets with Jesus
and he'll recite them

'til our meat goes cold.

You're
blessed with such a child.

Jesus too.

He's learned in scripture.

Hmmmmm.

Argues with the scribes and the
Pharisees in the synagogue.

Then you
and John would find kinship.

Hmmm, I must
first find him.

You should.

This attack on me, this was
beyond insults, beyond threat.

Hold it to their noses.

Let them know what
I have suffered.

Put your nose to the
stench that is your people,

who hurled filth at me.

But, for the brave legionnaires
who surrounded my litter,

protecting me ... I should have
died under the hail of stones.

And my wife is
attacked in your streets.

Governor...
I should level

this holy city

and cake the ruins with blood.
Governor,

though some oppose your rule...

And who are they?

You who claim authority?
Do you know that?

If not what value
are you to Rome?

Governor, my temple
guards have learned

that the attack upon your noble
wife was led by a zealot:

Samuel of Perea.

And why is he
not here in chains, tortured,

begging that death
relieve his agony? Why?

He and his followers

have fled to the wilds of
Galilee.

Your place of rule.

I'll offer rewards.

He'll be betrayed.

Easily found.
Found and killed.

Along with all of his followers.

Killed by you.
By me?

Do
I sense hesitation?

Do I tell the emperor our
enemies find sanctum

in your realm?
No.

I'll find him.

Kill him.

Hacked to shreds.

All of them.

Governor we share
your fully justified fury,

the enemies of order,
the enemies of us all.

Then prove it.

The body's of those who
disrespected my wife,

and my office here, that
I may see them, and soon.

Who were those people?

They're zealots.

Rather than submit they
cut their own throats.

Hear oh
Israel, the Lord is our God.

May the Lord bless
you and guide you.

May the Lord make his face shed
light upon you and be gracious

unto you?

With these waters ...
cleanse your soul.

May the Lord
bless you, and give you grace.

Let these waters clean
away, wash away her sins.

May the Lord
shine light upon her.

A new dawn is here.

Come do not be afraid.

Your new birth awaits.

Come to me.

May our God shine
bright upon your eyes.

Let this water
cleanse your soul.

Are you ready, my son?

Welcome.

You are ready for a new dawn.

Jesus.

Listen everyone, here is the
Lamb of God

who will shine a light on
all of you!

Here is the one who will wash
away the sin from the world.

Jesus!

Jesus!

Cousin.

How could you know me?

How could I not?

My cousin Jesus, it is you.

All this time I've known of the
prophecy and it's come true.

Come.

People!

The new light is here!

How are you so certain that
what you believe of me is true?

Cousin, in the
desert I found communion

with our Lord.

And the voices, they came...

The voices
told you I was coming?

Yes. But I'm
only to open the way.

God speaking of me?

Yes.

Cousin until this day,

while I'm a man of strong
belief,

I have worked a trade.

A carpenter.

Nothing more.

What is
prophesied cannot be denied.

The cup will be raised
to your lips, Jesus.

Baptize me.

And I too will go
into the desert,

and listen for the voice of God.
Yes. I will baptize you.

Though it is you who
should baptize me.

You're right.

Come.

Ahhh!!

Ahhh!!!

Let the
Lord shine his light upon you.

To the new dawn, the new
light is with you, my cousin.

Come.
Come.

That boat,
it was my father's.

Maybe his
father's before him.

It was made with iron
nails, nails have value.

Capped with trunnels
I can chisel them out.

We share.

Half and half.

I must ready my nets.

Fishing nails is easier
than netting fish.

For months now the
whole is near empty.

Do you ask
God's blessing?

I know about
you Jesus of Nazareth.

My brother Andrew
follows the Baptist.

He told how he greeted you.

Yes, I remember him.

So like the bug
eater, do you preach?

Or just pray like
the rest of us?

Take me with you.

Who refuses
a hand on the net?

Shall we pray?

Thank the Lord.

Ugh... Uhh...

Jesus.

This is from a single cast.

I've fished years and
nothing, nothing like this.

We prayed.

Yes but ...
I'm a simple man.

A sinner.

Never, never expecting this.

Follow me Simon.

I'll make you a fisher of men.

Ahhh... Ohhh...

John.

John and James are sons of
Zebedee, you must see this.

Is this not a wonder?

A wonder brought to us by Jesus,
the carpenter from Nazareth.

This is
nothing, only a sign.

And there will be many.

Follow me.

Look into your hearts, and you
will know that God wills it.

I denounce all those
that shame this land.

Antipas.

The Tetrarch, who in rampant
incest beds his brother's wife,

while suppressing the righteous.

And these

...Spies from the Counsel of
Sanhedrin.

The hypocrites.

Hypocrites one and all.

From the grandeur in which they
live they berate the poor,

calling you unclean
for the food you eat.

They shame you.

But with a purpose.

People! Come to the temple
they say, come.

Buy a lamb.

A white dove. A bullock for
sacrifice.

Redeem your sins only with the
death of an animal

born from the farms of our high
priests.

They have made of God's
house a market place.

I say to these spies, tell your
generation of vipers to beware,

look heavenward.

Flee the wrath that
will come from the Lord.

Flee from here,

the Day of Judgment
is here, arise people!

Rise up people.

Rise!

Arrest the
Baptist, a lunatic?

The wilderness crawls with them.

Can you allow more
discord in your domain?

Why me?

He attacks you.

The temple.

Along
with you and your wife majesty.

With vile accusations of incest.

I must consider the
peasants who hail him

as the coming of the prophet
Elijah.

Your father
served Rome

by the strength of his rule,
and thus they made him king.

The Romans trusted him

to prevent invasion from the
Parthians.

And to keep
order among the Jews.

For which he was hated.

Some hated
David, and Solomon.

Some hated Moses.

What's your point?

My point.

Achieving a peaceful
end of Roman rule.

The restoration
of a Jewish king,

who gives Romans the
order they demand.

And would Pilate
support that which costs him

his place as governor?

Of course
it works to his favor.

Gaining for Rome a vassal Jewish
kingdom that keeps order

that keeps Parthia at bay

without the cost of military
occupation.

Pontius Pilot would
return to Rome in triumph.

A strong hand with dangerous
fanatics would be a step

toward that goal.

Leaving you King of the Jews.

Shalom.

You know it is written if your
enemy brings you harm...

Tell me friend, if your enemy
brings you harm what is written?

An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

Yes. An eye for an eye.

A tooth for a tooth.

But now I say that
if God is love,

then loving is serving God.

And that means you
must love your enemy.

You preach weakness.

No, no, strength.

The strength that if
one strikes your cheek,

you turn and you let
him strike the other.

If he takes your cloak,
you give him your tunic.

Can you do this?

What you ask of us.

I will try.

Try with each breath
on each and every day.

Feeling that by our effort will
reveal to God

what is in our hearts.

Knowing that God is love, and in
a kingdom of God

we will love our enemies.

He's crazy.

You can't love enemies.

Love and forgive them,
that we can be forgiven.

And judge not so that
you not be judged.

The kingdom of
God is within you.

Another of this...
Each of you.

Those who look within
themselves will find it.

They walk away.

He is blessed with
something, I've seen it.

A Bountiful catch,
maybe nothing more.

Rabi.

Rabi please help me.

I'm cursed.

Why do you say this?

My son is
possessed by demons.

Take me to him.

The demons rest,
but they will awake.

What's his name?

David.

David, can you hear me?

I'm speaking to you David, not
to what evil possesses you

but to you.

I speak to you David.

Hear me David.

Hear me David.

That's it.

Ssh.
Ssh.

Be still.

Be still.

Is he gone to see the
child?

What's he going to do?

Get back! Get back!
Please!

What is he doing?
What is he doing?

He's casting them out.
Demons!

Demons... Can he do that?

Be still.

David.

David...

Oh no.

Please everyone just.
Step back.

Hear me.

The child is dead.

No, Oh No,
Say it isn't so.

Water.

David.

My son.

I'm thirsty.

Yes.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Ahhh...

The Baptist.

As promised.

Mother, he's the
one who slanders our house?

Salome this
is not for your eyes.

Take him away.

Let him rot, and his
prophecy rot with him.

Tell me, Rabbi.

In Jerusalem will you denounce
the Romans

and those in league with them?

I'm not a zealot.

I come only to bring
word of God's love.

And to say that all
must be born again.

Born a second time?

One can't re-enter
the womb, Rabbi.

Or is that one of the wonders
that supposedly

you have wrought?

Are you a
scribe or a Pharisee?

Are your
words not for all?

Yes for all.

I'm here to speak of a light
coming into the world.

And those who live by the
truth can enter this light,

knowing it.

It can be plainly seen that
whatever they do from them on,

is done through God.

Have you understood?

I have.

Rabbi!

John?

Is it John?

The Tetrarch
arrested him.

And they've taken him to the
fortress called Machaerus.

It's in the desert
across the Jordan.

There's no hope for rescue.

How do I
now speak of love?

Forgiveness, How?

I am trapped by the feelings of
a man who longs to attack

this injustice.

Now I know my father's
anger at how we fail him.

Now I feel I am not to
bring peace, but a sword.

What magnificent buildings.

Who is not awed by this?

Look upon them.

Burn them into your memory, for
I say that not one stone

will remain upon the other.

All will be thrown down.

All!
All of what you see.

It is written in the book
of the prophet, Malachi,

before the great and dreadful
day of the Lord comes,

I will send you
the Prophet Elijah.

Now I say that Elijah did come.

Calling us to redemption
in waters of the Jordan.

For the Lord offers forgiveness
of sin to all with a true heart.

He speaks
of John the Baptist.

I was redeemed in the waters
of Jordan by John the Baptist.

Yes.

Jesus speaks of John the Baptist

who has been imprisoned by his
enemies.

Yes. Like Elijah, John
came.

But they did not know him, and
did to him as they wished.

Free him.
Vipers. Destroy it.

Those of the Counsel of
the Sanhedrin

are a generation of vipers.

Viper!
Yes!

Vipers.
Vipers.

I say
destroy this temple.

Destroy it.

And in three days
I will raise it up again.

Destroy this market place
that shames our Lord.

HOSANNA.

Hosanna!

I share
your anger, Rabbi.

Let me follow you.

What is your name?

Judas Iscariot.

Bless you Judas.

Jesus challenges us
but I did not hear blasphemy.

And when he called for
the destruction of this temple

calling it a market place,
what is that if not blasphemy.

Many devout Jews
criticize the commerce,

the money lending.

Standing there,
he derides this ... beauty,

this grandeur with threats,
derides a place where for me,

each stone is sacrosanct.

A place where every day 700 of
our priests perform rituals

for the truly devout, for whom
this is the house of God.

To be protected with
our lives, our blood.

I heard the Nazarene's words,
and I heard blasphemy.

Joshua? Can we see him
Joshua?

Can we see the Baptist?

Ssh.

Get back.

Can we see him?

Impossible.

He'll be taken and killed.

Pass on your words and
bring his response.

Joshua.

They've come.

Thomas and Andrew
with news of Jesus.

Then
God has blessed me.

They say Jesus now
travels the land preaching

as you have preached.

God offers his
son, and Jesus takes up the cup.

And you will
be reunited with him?

No.

His will be a lone path.

I will be martyred
here, in this place.

No sadness.

Praise God for the son
he offers in Jesus.

Pray.

Pray Joshua.

Praise God.

My son.

Mother.

It is said that you've
lured fisherman from Galilee

from honest work to
follow as you preach.

Preach what they
say is contrary.

Not contrary
to the word of God.

Who knows?

My life is about this,
putting bread on the table.

Oh, we don't
live by bread alone.

What James means ... it is
said you healed the sick

as if by...

She won't say the word.
But I'll say it. Sorcery.

I comfort the sick.

When they're cured it
is by the hand of God.

Bear in mind what you go
about saying and doing

impacts us as well.

Mother.

James.

All who I call family,
how I love you

and will always love you.

You cannot understand
the path I've taken.

But the call of God
comes before all of us.

And for you, I'm just Jesus.

Not the most skilled
at carpentry.

And sadly no prophet is
accepted among his own.

I can only hope that maybe
someday

...who knows.

The betrothed, are
they not glorious to behold?

Salome was raised with
the laws of the covenant.

What joy to know my son's
chosen is from a house beholden

to our laws.

We of my house, live
by the word of God.

As do we.

Among us are
followers of a prophet.

A prophet?

Who spoke like Elijah and
washed away sin

in the waters of the Jordan.

And offended
the order of things.

As many are offended
by his imprisonment.

As Salome's bride price,
I ask for his freedom.

We offer
herds, our finest wines,

oils to enrich your house.

Riches do not
equal a prophet's life.

His arrest was
favored by the Roman Governor,

and the temple priests.

Do they in Jerusalem
dictate what is done here?

They would tax the
air we breathe?

What you ask
of me is beyond reason.

The Baptist cannot be released.

Isaac.

Isaac!
Come!

We shall have no
place in this house.

You saw her shame.

Until now I've seen the Baptist
as a threat to myself

and to our future rule.

Now I must suffer my
daughter's disgrace?

There will
be other suitors. Mmmm...

Kill him.

Claim he choked on a fish bone.

If I ruled, I'd kill him
and all who follow him.

I know
that voice.

My father.

And how
I wish you were he.

We are taxed to
death, how are we to eat?

Pay Up,
Pay!

Hey, That Man.

Hey jew..
Come on.

Come on...

Tell him I want
to dine in his home.

He'll refuse.

The tax collector has
no place with God.

He'll not refuse.

My master wishes to dine
at your house this evening.

Me?

Why?

Ask him.

My answer would give offense.

Why him?

God has no love for
those who tax us.

I'm not
worthy to offer you my table.

Who admits his faults,
and seeks forgiveness

will find redemption.

Look into your hearts
and you will know this.

I am hungry.

Invite me to your home.

You are young, and
supple, you are as men desire.

None come
seeking my hand.

Go on.

We must be careful.

The Baptist has
followers even here.

He is a curse upon us.

At fault is
my husband's weakness.

Unless our weakness is
failing to use his weakness.

When I'm made ready for sleep,

your husband lingers
outside my room.

While he once pledged
to care for you as his own.

That's the beauty you've become.

I'll address this with him.

No.

His lust is repulsive.

But perhaps useful.

Oh.

Unclean.

A leper woman.

Rabbi...

Rabbi cleanse me please!

I was here before you!

Please! Rabbi...

Rabbi please!!

John, draw them water.

But they're lepers.
Water.

Drink. Drink.

No. No. No.
Don't drink this.

Bring them some water.

Judas.

Let me look at you.

What is your name?

I'm called Mary.

My mother's name.

Come sit please.

What is your son's name?

His name is Judah.

Judah.

How old is Judah?

12.

May I touch you?

Gently.

You are without fear Mary?

I don't fear disease of
the skin or the flesh.

Only disease of the spirit.

Ah, it's
something you've known.

I'm from Magdala.

Do you know Magdala?

A barracks town
for Roman troops.

Where Jewish daughters are enslaved to
pay the tax debts of their families.

You would see an
end to such suffering.

I'm
told it's your purpose.

Oh be certain it
is Mary from Magdala.

Then my
purpose must be serving you.

Thank you.

Blessed are the poor in
spirit

for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.

Blessed are the meek, for
they will inherit the earth.

Blessed are those who
hunger and thirst...

Is
it the Nazarene who speaks?

Yes.

And those who should be tending
my fields are here bewitched

by him.

Blessed are those
persecuted

for their righteousness,

for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven?

Your father knows your needs,
knows them before you ask.

So this then is how
you should pray.

Our Father in Heaven,
hallowed be your name.

Your kingdom come,
your will be done,

on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily
bread, forgive us our debts,

as we also forgive our debtors.

And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

For yours is the Kingdom,

the power

and the glory.

Forever.

Amen.

Governor,

I saw huge crowds of men
enraptured as he spoke

his platitudes in the crude
accent of some Galilean peasant.

They wept, were overcome
believing he is the Messiah

come to bring God's wrath
upon Rome.

And what is more,
we've learned he's a cousin

of the Baptist.

We're being
menaced by a family of lunatics.

There's
real danger here.

If he could rally zealots
to free the Baptist,

there could be an
uprising in Galilee.

What's
his name, this man?

Jesus of Nazareth.

His cousin the Baptist should
be killed without delay.

That undercuts any
thoughts of freeing him,

and also makes this Jesus aware
of the fate

that could well await him.

Leave.

Finally.

Meaning?

Pilot's blessing

...kill the Baptist.

Killing him is a
convenience for the Roman.

Not for me.

I'm already vilified for
imprisoning the Baptist,

kill him and all of
Galilee turns against me.

Pontius Pilate's
praise of you to Caesar

could make you king.

What I see is Pilate
praising what serves Pilate.

If he wants the Baptist dead,
let him drag him to Jerusalem

and nail him to the cross.

So you are
set on doing nothing.

Salome told me you asked her
to dance at the feast

for your birthday tonight.

Did she also
tell you that she refused?

She's not a performer
from the market place.

You must offer her something.

Meaning ... she
is her mother's daughter.

We like our rewards.

And what would hers
be for entertaining my guests?

Suppose I tell her
that whatever she asks for

you will not refuse.

She must dance
to my satisfaction.

Be certain she will.

You remember your promise.

Salome, tell him.

Show Caesar you're a man.

And show us too.

Salome...

Leave it...

Ahhh!!!

Uhhhh....

Ohhh!!!

Rabbi!

Thomas and
Andrew welcome.

They've murdered him.

Cut his head off.

Beheaded?

You are with us
now, you and Thomas.

Come eat with us.

Yes, as John has said,
the cup has come to my lips...

I fear its bitterness, Father.

Give me the strength
to welcome it.

Who am I?

What am I?

How do people call
the son of man?

Tell me?

Tell me.

For me ... you are a
giver of courage to act

as I never imagined.

Reaching out for the sick
...the unclean

...without fear.

But Judas,
how am I called?

I've heard you
called coming of Elijah.

A prophet.

What else is said?

Many will believe you're
the Baptist risen from the dead.

There was no
greater prophet than John.

But you, you who see
me eat, sleep, wash,

know my ever gesture, my
moods, who do you say I am?

You're the anointed one.

Son

...of the living God.

Bless you
Simon, Son of Jonah.

No other has said this.

I think it was revealed to
you by my heavenly Father.

It is simply
what I believe.

From now on
I'll call you Peter.

Peter?

In Greek,
Peter means rock.

And on this rock,
I'll build my church

and give you the keys to the
kingdom of heaven.

I must be alone now.

You believe he's...

The Messiah.

Take great
care saying that.

What harm will
come to God's chosen?

Before these Counsel

of the Sanhedrin proceeds to
judgment I should tell you

we have been warned that

the Nazarene Jesus has come
to Jerusalem.

It is proposed that we forbid
him to enter

our holy house of God.

Yes. Yes.

No. No. No. No.

We
may dispute his words,

but we cannot deny a devout
Jew entry to the temple.

I ... I have heard
Jesus speak and he is to be

welcomed, not shunned.

Allow
him ... allow him in.

Deny Him.

So, the Nazarene
enters this very room.

Where his name is spoken,
dissention follows.

Allow him.

He
must be allowed entry.

He is a Jew.

Like us.

But I'll not
push to forbid him entry.

I only recall Jeremiah's
warning of false prophets.

They fill you with false hopes.

They speak visions
from their own minds.

Not from the mouth of the Lord.

When Jesus says the meek
shall inherit the earth,

there's nothing meek about him,
nor those that follow him.

But it's true they seek
to inherit the earth.

Allow
him, allow him in!

It's the law.

ALLOW HIM! ALLOW HIM!

We have lost.

Let the Nazarene come.

With luck he may
condemn himself.

Bring the woman.

We are now to hear and judge the
case of a woman who had defiled

the sacred covenants
of marriage.

And thus brought great shame
upon her husband's house.

What shall we do?

Let the guards take him away?

We're enacting a law.

I want you to provoke him.

We
stand here ready to enact

the Law of Moses, an adulteress
condemned by the High Court

of the Temple is to be stoned.

A punishment called
for by Moses.

Do you deny the law
revealed on Mount Sinai?

She has sinned.

And been judged.

Do you oppose the
law of the Torah?

Is his silence a defense
of her fornications?

Her harlotry?

I know you, Jesus of Nazareth.

You have opinions on everything.

What's his opinion on this?

Any among you
who is without sin,

let him be the first
to cast a stone at her.

Any among you who
is without sin?

God
has set forth the law not him.

The law must be carried out.

Kill her.

Here, kill her.

You kill her.

I cannot.

Then neither can I.

I have
begged for forgiveness.

Go and sin no more.

We are the law.

We will see you accused
judged and punished for this.

To maintain the order that
your office demands

we must have obedience to our
laws.

Now this man, this false
claimant to religious stature

has thwarted the legal
execution of an adulteress.

You have a
court, try him, stone him.

Yes that would of
course be my first thought,

but with shame I must
say that even among us,

even among the Sanhedrin
are those he has corrupted.

My laws are Roman.

His crime is not Sedition.

Is it not.

He rails against Roman taxes.

If I were to
crucify every Jew

who rails against our taxes,

I would have to level the
Cedars of Lebanon for wood.

His crime must be an attack
against our Emperor, our rule.

He attacks those
who support your rule,

does that not inspire concern.

Concern, but
nothing that validates action.

Make a case for
Sedition, with evidence.

Learn where he
speaks and with whom.

Prove that he is a threat to
Roman rule

...and I will have him
crucified.

Each day I hear the
servants speaking of him.

What is the message
of this Jesus?

Many things.

Nothing that concerns us.

What?

It'll
bore the slaves.

The curse of being
a slave is boredom

with what we do.

Not all we do.

Enough!

What does he preach?

That God wants
the meek to inherit the earth.

The poor to be rich.

The weak to be strong.

Platitudes of popular appeal.

None of
it to be believed?

Well it
flies in the face of history.

Caesarea is named
after a conqueror.

To the south of
us is Alexandria,

also named for a conqueror.

If there really is one
single ... all powerful God,

as Jesus and these Jews claim,
he clearly favors the strong,

over the weak.

Things are as the Gods intend.

The meek such as this lovely
creature

will never inherit the earth.

HA!

This man Jesus he has
drawn many to cast away

their wealth to follow him.

He lures sane
men from their wealth?

He speaks of
a time, soon coming,

when rich men will be poor.

Powerful men cast down and ...
the Temple itself destroyed

by God's wrath.

The Priests are right,
this Nazarene is a menace.

Search among your ranks,

Chuza, find those who are most
trustworthy.

All information about this
Nazarene is of value to me.

Matthew!

Far from the old days when
squeezing taxes from peasants

was like ringing
water from stones.

How astonished I was to hear
that you'd given up

all your wealth to follow the
Nazarene.

Who is he?

A tax
collector who feels as

Matthew once did. Regretting
what he must do.

And you would be?

Judas Iscariot.

I'm Asher.

And your caution
is well advised.

The Nazarene's fame
breeds envy even hatred.

But I for one admire the
choice that you've made.

Change your ways.

And follow us.

How I wish.

How I wish, but the
burden of hungry mouths.

And the burden
of a fine horse?

Yes.

I admit weakness.

Isn't that one step
towards redemption?

It is said that the Rabbi goes
to Jerusalem for Passover.

It's his intention.

I know of a dwelling there.

I have well placed friends.

A place has been offered.

Is the
dwelling within the city?

I may seek you out Matthew.

A morning's
walk from the gate.

Home of a land owner, Lazarus.

God speed your journey.

I have urgent news for
the Tetrarch's steward.

Open the gates.

Asher.

Send word to the Tetrarch,
I have news of the Nazarene.

And be ready to open
your coffers, Chuza,

what I bring is of great value.

Jesus is staying outside
the city at the house

of a land owner named Lazarus.

He can't be arrested
there too many people.

We must know his movements
when he comes to Jerusalem.

We need somewhere quiet.

I'll put a watch on the house.

Outside the wall
dressed as pilgrims,

spies are watching us.

To report on our
drunkenness, hey Lazarus?

My debauchery.

That I consort with sinners and
tax collectors, right Matthew?

Former sinner
and tax collector.

And I
know the labels put on me.

We will
put them on trial?

Put whom on trial?

Them.

Those who are against us.

When you're king, James
and I wish to sit by your throne

as sentence is passed on them.

See you condemn
them to eternal flames.

That's how you
imagine the kingdom of God?

Me on a throne?

Do I wear a gold crown?

I would think a
crown of the purest gold.

What, like
some earthly king?

Do I preside over
lackeys and ring kissers?

I mean you travel with me, your
ears are open to every word,

but you hear nothing.

Nothing.

Have you so failed to understand
being who I am, what I must do?

Whoever would be a master,
must first be a slave.

Who wants to be served
must first serve.

I am here to give my life
as a ransom for the many.

In the Kingdom of God there
are no thrones, no crowns,

no rule of nations.

My reward for earthly
service will be suffering.

Understand that.

Suffering.

To bring the message
of God's love,

I am the resurrection
and the life.

And those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live.

If you
are praying I will leave.

I came here to pray.

Pray to control my anger
and my frustration.

But then I heard my father's
voice in that song,

in the sweetness of that song.

Mhmmm...

Your anger is gone.

Do you know the prophets? What they
say awaits the one God has sent?

There was little
talk of prophets

in the barracks of Magdala.

Well, you know my words.

Yes.

And that's enough.

Yes...

Then I'll leave
you to pray.

Mary.

The cup from which I must
drink, how very bitter it is.

Go Mary of Magdala.

What is this?

This beast is little
more than a yearling.

He told us to
find a donkey colt.

Prophecy of Zachariah.

He enters Jerusalem
on that for Passover?

The Messiah will arrive at
the holy city astride

a donkey colt.

Now he acts
out a prophecy.

Why should he not?

What more is there in the
prophecy of the Messiah's coming?

Say it.

We all share however it goes.

The Messiah will
be falsely accused.

He'll be beaten.

Spat upon.

He'll be killed. And all those
who love him will look on

unable to stop the agony.

And those who follow him?

I see.

I'm told of a great Rabbi

who was asked to recite the
Torah while standing on one leg.

He said, 'do not unto others as
you would not have them do

unto you.' This is the true
wisdom of the Torah.

The rest is all commentary.

Go and learn it.

Do
you share his belief?

I do.

Saying simply, love your
neighbor as you love yourself.

But I put one commandment
even before this.

Hear, oh Israel, the
Lord our God is one.

Love the Lord your God
with all your heart,

your mind and your
strength, saying this,

you are close to
the Kingdom of God.

Rabbi.

While some oppose you.

The wisdom of your
words is not lost on us.

Rabbi, what say you of taxes?

Should Jews pay taxes
to this man in Rome?

What do you say Rabbi?

Give him an answer Rabbi.

Let me see the coin.

Who is this?

You know.

That's Caesar Tiberius.

What do you think?

Should Jews pay taxes to Caesar?

Give to Caesar
that which is Caesar's,

and give unto God
that which is God's.

Leave in
peace, Lamb of God.

Their Lamb of God
will be our lamb of sacrifice.

That you still
read by the light of a flame.

I envy you your
sharpness of vision.

The characters are blurred.

But I know the entire scriptures
by heart and I find it curiously

comforting to actually
hold them in my hand.

It is almost your time to start
your duties in the temple and

you have not slept.

I have ... failed you.

I've failed the temple.

When Passover ends, the
Nazarene, he will leave,

conceal himself in
the hide of the land.

Then he will return, with
ever greater numbers

in his following, all believing
that he is the Messiah,

all willing to be part of a
rebellion that brings him

to the throne.

But I remember,

I remember as
a child, seeing

...bodies, hundreds of

...dead Jews,

killed by the Romans.

The revolts of Judas

the Galilean.

Also hailed
as the Messiah.

Do you understand my fear?

The horror that this man
could bring to our people.

Have you confronted him?

To no avail.

He seeks confrontation then
turns our words against us,

he mocks us in our own temple.

God's word is quite clear.

Any false prophet who incites
rebellion

against God's authority should
be put to death.

You ... are the most
respected voice of that law.

Will you take his
judgment upon yourself?

Find a way to put him before me.

May I come in?

This is Joanna.

She brings perfumed oils and
asks to anoint your hair.

Bless you, Joanna.

You come with a
hidden purpose Joanna.

I'm the wife of Chuza.

Chief Steward of the Tetrarch.

They speak of killing you, the
Tetrarch, those of the Temple.

And you came
to warn me, why?

My cousin
was to be stoned.

She lives because of you.

Don't go to Jerusalem.

I must.

This is a
house of prayer.

This is my...

Get Malchus!
Not a den of thieves.

It is God's House.

Down with the money lenders!

Down with
the money lenders!

AAArrgh.

Behold the
King of the Jews!

Turn out the guard.

Oh no
hey, hey, hey, hey.

Behold
the King of the Jews!

Behold the King of the Jews.

My house will be
called the house of prayer.

You have made it
a den of thieves.

You'll die for this.

Nazarene, order them
to stop this blasphemous praise.

Stop?

If I stop the stones
themselves would cry out!

Guards, arrest him!

Arrest that man.

Ahhh!!!

Enough!

Guards hold your place.

...hold your place!
...hold your place!

What I came to do,

is done.

Our impotence in dealing

with this man will bring about
the distain of the Romans.

He invalidates our authority
both in the temple

and in Jerusalem.

If he leaves, and
returns a triumphant leader.

Pilate may decide to deal
with him instead of us.

Let's judge him
here, in this room.

And stone him to death.
How?

The mob makes his
arrest impossible.

He's surrounded by
hundreds who venerate him.

I have seen a weakness.

Mmmm...

Tell us.

Betrayal, by one of his own.

Impossible.
They worship him.

Perhaps not all.

Judas Iscariot.

The tax collector.

Wasn't
sure you'd remember me,

going as you go,
seeing many faces.

Few horses like this.

Yes to be admired he is.

You should have a fine horse, be
finely mounted as befits

those who serve a king.

You were at the temple.

In truth, no.

I long for the
rewards of heaven,

but I take the coin
and let the credit go,

and ignore the promises
of kingdoms yet to come.

And facing what you face,
hearing the sighs of the dying

on the hill of Golgotha.

Where I in your place, my every
breath would tighten with fear.

A horse such
as this, costs what?

A stallion of his blood he could
be had for 15 pieces of silver.

But I also know a man who would
offer you 30 pieces of silver.

In return for what?

Willingness to choose life
over death.

Where would
this man be found?

I need to speak with Malchus.

Asher sent me.

I haven't much time.

When and where
can we find him alone?

The others are
always at his side.

The 12.

Or better said, 12 minus one.

Tonight, we will eat the
Passover meal here in Jerusalem.

Where?

I don't yet know.

A room.

It was decided without me.

So far I hear nothing
worth 30 pieces of silver.

I'll leave that
meal and come here.

Doing this,
you save your life.

Yes.

That must be why I did this.

Everywhere
there is talk of you.

An Inn gave us food and lodging
and would accept no payment.

My son is hailed for
bringing a message from God.

And those of Nazareth.

Believing you
to be the Messiah? Yes.

Some do.

And you?

So great will be my pride,

when I hear you speak at the
temple.

I'll not
speak there again.

But on the road, many
were coming to hear you.

That's over now.

I've come all this way
...you'll deny me that?

The decision isn't mine.

I can't speak of it with you.

Mother, I have so
longed for you.

The pain of absence
has been terrible.

But now it's too late.

Too late?

What do you mean?

James, take
her to Nazareth.

Have you lost
your mind saying this?

I beg you spare
her from what must come.

Where are you going?

Jesus?

Come, we must go....

You wash our feet why?

Call me Lord,
and place me above you.

I wash your feet to show that
no master is greater

than his servant.

And no messenger is greater
than the one who sends him.

Come and eat what God has
blessed on this Passover night.

God bless us.

Start carving
Matthew, carve it.

Brothers, Let us talk of what is
written

and what prophets have said.

It's in the scripture.

He who shares my bread, has
lifted his heel against me.

I tell you now, before it
happens, so when it does happen,

you know that I'm he.

No one questions that.

Many will.

And one will betray me.

How can you say this?

I have been loyal.

We've all been loyal.

He's testing us again.

Brothers, I'll be with
you only a little longer.

Take what I've said,

that in me you'll have peace
in a world of anger and despair.

Take courage for I have overcome
the world, but where I now go,

you cannot follow.
I'll follow.

I'd lay down my life.

Go to prison. To death.

Peter this very night
before the cock has crowed,

you will deny three
times that you know me.

I tell you now.

Where is Judas?

The Garden of Gethsemane.

They will go there to pray.

It's dark
in that garden.

How will my men
know which is him?

I will greet
him with a kiss.

Later.

Oh my darling.

Not another dream
of the Baptist.

I can't sleep.

Oh the rest I so desperately
need, and then I awaken,

there that thing is beside me.

No. No it is gone.

These are dreams.

One of the servants
told me it wasn't found.

It wasn't buried.

The head!

No. It was eaten by
jackals in the desert.

His follower
brings this horror.

Jesus, takes revenge.

Tell her the sorcery
of the Nazarene

will have an end.

You tell
me he will die too.

Father take
this cup from me.

This bitter cup.

If it's not possible that
this cup be taken away...

Your will be done.

So I'm betrayed with a kiss.

Take me.

Let them go.

You don't
give orders to me.

Agh!

Agh!

Agh!

Leave him.

Grab the mad man.

Bind his hands.

Save yourselves.

For me.

You must live.

Go!

I'm going to Jerusalem.

No my brother.

They'll find you.
They'll kill you.

I'm going.

It's cold
and the hour is late.

And the matter urgent.

The matter being?

We've been told the temple guards
have arrested Jesus of Nazareth.

An
issue of your faith.

An issue of law.

Law
beyond my provenance.

Both our
laws and yours violated.

He's been taken to
the house of Caiaphas,

not to the temple and the
chamber of hewn stone.

His trial will be unjust.

Sometimes
things are done for expediency.

Cicero
writing about your Roman law,

claims where there is immorality
there can be no expediency.

This is immoral.

Send troops.

Free him.

Roman troops
to the home of a High Priest.

Are you insane?

Governor, I ask as a
devout Jew do not allow

this man to be murdered.

If he is stoned
it is beyond my purview.

They want him crucified.

A punishment
only I can pronounce.

Ah..

Will you?

It's late and I am cold.

You are accused of acts

of sorcery.

Spreading lies.

Corrupting others.

I spoke openly in
synagogues, the temple.

Places where Jews
came to hear of God.

They came to hear of God.

The words you gave
them came from Satan.

Why not ask
those who have heard me?

They know what I said.

Agh!

This is the way
you answer the High Priest?

Aghh!

Aghh!

I command you!

Let us through.

Let us through.

Please! Make way!

Open this!

You truly claim you
are the son of the blessed one?

I am.

You have heard
blasphemy from his lips.

These words and more.

His claim he's a prophet.

Blindfold him.

Give us a prophecy,
oh Prophet Jesus.

Who struck that blow?

Prophets are all seeing.

Stop!

Stop this disgrace.

You dare to interfere.

Annas,
we are shamed by what we see.

If this ... this
cabal is to be called a trial

then I demand that
we are included.

You are the two, This blasphemer

will be judged by a majority.

What's happening?

Jesus is a criminal,
posing as the Messiah.

Not a man who
walks on the waters,

who feeds the multitudes.

You saw these wonders?

Ask yourselves would
priests lay hands upon him

if he were truly the Messiah?

People are
fooled by sorcery.

You ... I've seen
you with him before.

No, I, I, I don't
need this Nazarene.

It's too dangerous
here, we should go.

No.

Come on Simon.

She says you're a follower.

She's wrong.

Deny it under oath.

I deny him, now enough.

The vote is against you.

Make way! Make way!

These goats,
where do you take them?

To the temple.

For sacrifice?

He leads them to death,
he's their betrayer.

Yeah...

I want that rope, just the rope.

I'll pay.

Here.

Unless I lead
him the heard will scatter.

Scatter and be saved.

I need the rope.

Here ...buy more
goats, ten times these.

Ten times ten.

Or a horse.

Yes, now you imagine
it, owning a horse.

I know the feeling.

Governor,
you'll not open the gate?

We've brought a
criminal for judgment.

Take him and
judge him under your law.

He won't hear the charge.

Silence I say!

He should be executed
for speaking

against the rule of Caesar.

Claiming he is King of the Jews.

Are
you King of the Jews?

My kingdom is
not of this world.

I hear no
support for your charges.

His cryptic
speech is but a ploy.

He is a criminal.

We have witnesses.

He
began his crimes in Galilee.

Galilee?

Then take him to the
Tetrarch of Galilee.

He should judge this man.

There he is again.

He is one of them.

I don't know that
man, you're mistaken.

You're lying.

All is as he said.

Where is God's
army of angels?

What do you hear?

Caiaphas is
bringing him here.

Hearing Jesus
comes from Galilee,

Pilate wants his
blood on my hands.

He wants my name to curse
the lips of every Jew.

Sillaeus, leave us.

Go!

I will deal
no more with holy men.

I'm a stone wall. Herodias.

I'll not argue.

Jesus threatens Priests, but
other than a mob hailing him

King of the Jews, he
is no threat to you.

His death need not
be upon our house.

I cannot simply hide.

Face him.

Let the mob see who is truly
fit to be King of the Jews.

I'm told
you work miracles.

Do something.

Anything wondrous.

Make bread fall
from the heavens.

Feed us a morning meal.

My preference is
lentils and barley.

Do something!

A miracle could save you.

It is said that Simon
the Magus could fly. Hm?

But, can Jesus the Nazarene fly?

Release him!

Let him be born aloft.

Go! Shh...

Oh, oh look, look,
there he, there he goes.

No. I'm wrong.

A bird.

Not Jesus.

He makes no wonders
but is hailed as King.

Let him be adorned as a King.

Come, come.

The purple robe of royal office.

No King should go
forth without a staff.

Patience.

Patience.

Nothing has been forgotten.

Agh!

Agh.

Agh.

I give you a royal
threat to Caesar Tiberius,

bring him back to the Romans
to be judged for Sedition.

You cannot dismiss us.

He expects you to
deal with this.

Bring him back to
Pilate, I'm done with him.

Why must you
cater to these Priests?

The Tetrarch?

Without them I cannot
easily govern these people.

Kill him, and you'll
bear the wrath of his following.

I
must do something.

I cannot simply set him loose.

GUARDS!

Scourge him.

What's happening?

Let me through!

Master.

Agh.

His cry.

Agh.

My baby boy.

Oh my baby boy. Ahhh!!

Agh!

No! No!

You mustn't.

Agh!

Agh. Agh. Agh.

Agh!

Agh! Agh... Agh...

Agh!

Make the guard stop!

No!

Please!

Agh!

Agh.!

Aghhh!!

Ahhh!!

Agh!

Scourging
is punishment enough.

He may not survive. Many don't.

End this
threat to order.

End it.

Let the death of this one man
prevent the deaths of many.

Crucify him..

No!

NO!

Behold Jesus...

Ohhh.. Ahh!

Betrayed.

Humiliated.

And soon agony beyond
what you can imagine..

Oh oh.

Is this the glory
of God you bragged of?

Glory.

As I expected.

No.

The temple is God's glory.

Aaah, God's
glory is love.

To know love is to know God.

Give him that...
scort..

Then Love me.

Sweet Jesus.

I do love you.

I do love you.

I want to hear
rage from your lips.

Hear it as you hang
nailed to the wood.

You will vomit forth a ... a
hatred that will put a lie

to your words.

Why are you afraid?

Here is
a false prophet.

A false king.

Mock him.

For his lies.

Come ... take joy
at his suffering.

Oh ... great king.

Great prophet.

Mock him.

Go on!

Come.

Move!

Agh!

Move!

Honor the
King of the Jews!

No! No! No!

Agh!

Agh.

Agh.

Agh.

Agh!

Agh. Agh.

Agh! Agh.

Agh. Agh. Agh. Agh.

Forgive them ... they
know not what they do.

Agh.

Agh.

Agh.

Agh!! Agh!!

He spoke.

He cursed you.

No.

He asked his God to forgive us.

Of all his followers,
only you ... of all of them,

only you?

Peter claims he can
see no more of his pain.

The others fear for their lives.

Agh.

Agh.

Why have you forsaken me?

If his father has forsaken
him, we are all forsaken.

Aghhh!

It is finished.

Gasp. Aaaaah.

He said it's finished.

My son...

I am Nicodemus.

And this is Joseph of Arimathea.

We offer a shroud, and
we have a tomb for Jesus.

I thought this would end
as you said it would end.

It is ended.

All I ask is for
assurance of that.

Certainty that...

What that
he will not reappear?

Of course not.
All I ask...

Enough.

Enough.

Do not tell me that
Priest delays our journey.

We'll be on the
road to Caesarea as planned.

What brought him here?

Fear.

The man is dead.

What more could he want?

He wants the
tomb guarded by Roman soldiers.

He, of all people,
worries the Nazarene

will return from the dead.

He claims
concern that the followers

of Jesus will take the body in
order to make it appear

that he has risen.

Which do you believe?

I believe
that guarding that tomb

is a waste of Roman
soldiers' efforts.

Let's begin our journey.

Breathy Laugh

Mmmm!

Yes.

I am Simon.

Called by you, Peter,
the rock of your faith.

And I will be your
fisher of men.

He has come!

Come back to us!

Yes....

According
to early Christian tradition,

Simon took the mission
of Jesus to Rome

where he formalised the nascent
Christian church.

The Romans sentenced
him to death

it is claimed he asked to be
crucified upside down

so that his death would not
be the equal of Jesus.

The Romans granted his wish
early writings speak of James

preaching of Jesus in the
Jerusalem Temple

it's said he was stoned
to death.

Supposedly for challenging the
Temple's high priests

the fates of other disciples are
consigned to legend

and apocryphal texts.

Andrew was crucified in Greece

Thomas was speared
to death in India

Simon sawed in half in persia.

Matthew murdered in Ethiopia.

According to tradition, John was
not martyred but spent time

in exile on Patmos and
lived to ninety.

Scholars debate the authorship
of the Gospel of John,

held by some to be an eye
witness account

of the life of Jesus.

Antipas continued pressing Rome
to be named king

until his efforts offended
the new emperor,

caligula antipas and herodia
were exiled to Gaul,

where they died in obscurity.

Pontius Pilate was recalled to
Rome, while Joseph Caiaphas,

without his Roman Ally, lost
his position within the temple

whereas the story of Jesus, a
humble Carpenter of Nazareth,

gave birth to one of the
world's foremost religions.

Today there are more than two
billion christians worldwide.
