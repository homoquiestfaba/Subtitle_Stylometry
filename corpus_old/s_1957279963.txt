Your hands areâ€¦ disgusting.

Let me do it.

Disgusting?

Just breathe.

It's alright.

I'll go with Dad.

My truck's up there.

Don't worry.

Wait here.

What's wrong?

It's Dad!

Wait here.

I'm going back inâ€¦

Stay here.

No. Dad would've heard this.

You're lying!

My Dad used the radio every day!

You're nothing like him!

It's not a song.

On the radio.

Beyond The Seaâ€¦ Right?

It's not a songâ€¦

It's a signal.

They're telling us where to look.

I looked up the radio station.

â€¦where the song is coming from.

It's an island!

I can follow the train tracksâ€¦

It's not even one day.

Then I can find a boat.

You can't do this.

If I can find the song.
Where it's coming fromâ€¦

I can use thisâ€¦

to change thisâ€¦

into this!

Mom, will neverâ€¦ let you go.

I can save them.

I can save us.

I'll tell her.

Momâ€¦ I'll tell her.

Please don't do this!

I need to try.

Why?

Because Dad would.

And look what happened to him.

Enunciateâ€¦ Remember?

Help me.

What home?

You saidâ€¦your wifeâ€¦

You saidâ€¦

â€¦that you could not do enough.

Now you can.

I found a boat.

Don't go.

I will be right back.

A matter of hours.

But the baby, I don't know how--

I showed you how to do it.

Stay calm.

You have everything you need.

Everything.

Pleaseâ€¦

Lookâ€¦

If I don't goâ€¦

Soon you'll be in a lot of pain.

And I won't knowâ€¦

â€¦ I won't lose you too.

Breatheâ€¦

I'll be right back.
