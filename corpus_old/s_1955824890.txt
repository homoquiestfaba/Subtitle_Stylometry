(MAN AND WOMAN VOCALIZING)

WOMAN:<i>
â™ªâ™ª Hark, how the bells,
sweet silver bells</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª All seem to say,
throw cares away</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Christmas is here,
bringing good cheer</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª To young and old,
meek and the bold</i>


â™ªâ™ª With joyful ring,
all caroling

<i>â™ªâ™ª One seems to hear
words of good cheer</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª From everywhere
filling the air</i>

(WOMAN VOCALIZING)

<i>â™ªâ™ª Ding, dong, ding, dong</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Ding, dong, ding, dong â™ªâ™ª</i>

(WOMAN VOCALIZING)

Ooh! (SHOUTING)


Don't think I don't
see you, little one.

I think there's enough
for both of us, though.

VOICE: (ECHOING)<i> Mary.</i>
(GASPS)


(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

Fear not,

for you have been
favored by God to
conceive and bear a son.

A... A son?

But how?

The Holy Spirit will
overshadow you,

and the child will be called
the Son of God.

For nothing is
impossible with God.

Thank you.

Do I say thank you?
I mean, yes.

Let it be done, just as you say.





gonna believe this!

ALL: Whoa!

ALL: Huh?

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Whoa.

Whoa.

ALL:
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Whoa.

(IN LOW-PITCHED VOICE) Whoa.

(ALL SHRIEKING)

Whoa! (CHUCKLES)

Okay. You are not
gonna believe this,

but I think a new star
just appeared in the sky...

No, no, no.

What have I said
about looking
through that thing?

Come on. Wait.

This doesn't happen every day.



There's nothing out
there for you, kid.

Things are changing.

That star means something.

And I'm not gonna
be here forever.

DAVE: Yeah-yeah! (LAUGHS) Hoo!

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

I love the smell of freshly
ground grain in the morning.

Hey, kid, your unemployed
bird friend's here.

Dave! (LAUGHS)

Hey, pal.
What's new out there today?

Mmm. Oh, um, you know,
not a whole lot.

I mean, it's Nazareth.

That rooster on Fifth Street
overslept again.

And, uh, that horse, uh...

What is his name?
Jeremiah? Hezekiah?

There's an &quot;iah&quot; in there.
I know that.

He lost a shoe.

And then, well... (CHUCKLES)

I mean, it's barely
worth mentioning,

but the, um, royal
caravan is rolling
through town today.

What? The royal caravan?

Are you kidding?
(EXCITEDLY) No, buddy! For real!

I spotted them outside of town

and had to come
straight here to tell you.

we've been waiting for.

Nazareth can kiss my gleaming
white tail feathers good-bye.

that star was a sign.

We're meant for something
greater than this.

This is our job,
and once you accept that,

you'll be a glowing
picture of happiness.

Like me.

Uh, we're talking about
the royal caravan here.

It's the ultimate job.

(BELLS JINGLING)

<i>You get to go from town
to town, see the world,
visit important people,</i>

<i>and you get to march
with the biggest, strongest,</i>

<i>greatest horses in the world.</i>

ALL: Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave!

<i>All the animals in every town
watching us go by.</i>

ALL: Dave! Dave! Dave!

<i>And we'll finally be doing
something important.</i>

(OLD DONKEY SCOFFS)
Huh?

A miniature donkey
in the royal caravan?

That'll be the day.

Don't listen to him.

And what's a dove gonna do,
carry one grape at a time?

Hey, at least he's not
locked up in a mill like us.

I'm telling you,
folks in this town
just don't get it.

And, I could carry two grapes,

one in each talon, thank you very much.
(BELLS JINGLING)

Bells.

(GASPS)
Wait. Bells.

That's them.



It's time to activate
Operation Prison Break.

Okay.

All I have to do is kick
this sharp metal killer stick

towards my head and duck.

It'll cut your harness...

And I'll finally be free.

Oh, I love Operation
Prison Break.

Such a good idea.
Here we go.

Oh...

(EXCLAIMING)
Okay, that's not good.

Oh, boy. (GASPS)





See? I knew that would work.

Just like we planned. (LAUGHS)

With a momentary
near-death hiccup.

Well, old-timer,
it's been real.

Good luck to you.
Wait, Dave.

We can't just leave him.

Buddy, I get where
you're coming from,

but it's the royal caravan,
not the retirement caravan.

Look at him.
He's like 300 years old.

All right. What's going
on in... (GRUNTS)

Oh...

Uh... (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

Mmm. Now, this ought
to keep you where you belong.

Hyah!

but a great big, rotten...


Oh, boy.


good-for-nothing bully!

Yeah, you better walk away.

Ah. Who needs
the royal caravan?

There's plenty of excitement
here in Nazareth.


I'm gonna be honest.
I'm very upset right now.

I'm gonna go find
someone to poop on.

If that miller thinks
this yoke is gonna stop me...

Ooh, boy, do I have
a surprise for him.

I'll be riding with kings
any day now. You'll see.

(GRUNTING FRUSTRATEDLY)

Huh. Still no Mary.

Okay. Just a little late.

It's normal to be late
to your wedding feast.
Totally normal.

Just like it's normal
to talk to yourself.

ZECHARIAH: There he is!

Hey.
Hi, Joseph.

Looking good!

(JOSEPH CHUCKLES)

Mary. You made it.

You look beautiful.

So do you.

Uh, well, handsome.

I've missed you.

You're a little late,
you know. I was
starting to worry.

ZECHARIAH: Oh, sorry.

That's our fault.
We're always late.

&quot;We&quot; who? You were driving.

She was such a big help to us
these past several months.

Wasn't she, John?

Sorry, big guy.

I know how great she is,
but I'm taking her back.

Joseph?

There's something
I want to talk to you about.

Of course.

And, just warning you,
it might be a lot to take in.

Mary, it's our wedding feast.

Of course. You can
tell me anything.


(ALL EXCLAIMING)

Sorry, uh, what did you want
to talk about?

Oh, it can wait.

Let's enjoy the party.

So, any new escape plans, kid?

What's the point?

I'm always gonna be stuck
on the same old wheel
with the same old view.

What's wrong with the view?


I know it feels like
we're just going in circles.

We are.

Look, kid.

We're mill donkeys.

We grind grain.
We don't carry kings.

Yeah.

Should've listened to you
and given up a long time ago.




What is happening?

Kid, it's my leg. Go get help.


These good-for-nothing
animals.

What is it now?

(OLD DONKEY MOANING)
(GROWLS)

Just what I needed.


Are the gates open?
What?

Yeah.
MILLER: You!

What are you doing...


Kid, get out of here.

Wait, but I thought you said...

What about you?

I'll be fine.

I just hope you find
what you're looking for.


I don't know what to say.

You're welcome, kid.

Now, get going.

Oh, no, you don't!

You're free, kid.
Make it count.


(LIVELY CHATTER)

What?

Hey!
Huh?

Where do you think you're going?

Oh!
Get back here!

Look, I'm not gonna
be here long.

Runaway donkey!
Somebody grab him!

Sorry, hon. Looks like
I'm leaving sooner
than I thought.

Never forget me!
(SCOFFS)

You broke out! Yes,
the dream is back on.
Whoo-hoo!

See, not free yet.

The miller!
The miller's on my tail!

Yeah, and he does
not look happy.

I am not happy!

Follow me.

This way. Up here.
No, no, not up.

No, donkey don't like up!





Sorry. Sorry.
(SHRIEKS)

I'm a really nice guy.


Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!



What now?
Jump.

Jump? What, are you crazy?

Just jump!



A flying donkey!

Ah! Well, greetings, ladies.

(GROANS)
(GASPS)



Wait a second.
Are they eating chicken?

Ladies, run!


Other way. Other way!



No, no. Where'd you go?


Dave? Dave? Where are you?

I got you now.


Oh, no.

No, no, no.
There's no way out of this.


Here we go!




He's a good man.
He'll understand.

Thanks.

Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

Zechariah! Party's over.

Let's go.

Great party, guys.

Bye, now.
Joseph,

You must be the happiest
man in the world.

Or second happiest.

Clearly, I'm the happiest.

ELIZABETH: You know,
I think I liked you better
when you couldn't talk.

Wow.

Our place is a mess.

&quot;Our place.&quot;

I like the sound of that.


Me, too.

Well, this place
isn't gonna clean itself.

I'm starting with the dishes.

And I'll start down here.

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

how to tell him about you.

It's all good news. Promise.

All good news. (CHUCKLES)

Yep.
(CLATTERING)




(GASPS)
(SHOUTS)


I'm caught again.

There's gotta be
a better hiding place.

Okay, maybe not here.

Nope, not that one, either.

Why couldn't I be smaller?

The one time
I wish I was smaller.


(BRAYING)
(CHUCKLES)

You poor thing.

(BRAYING)
You're hurt.

What is she doing?

That can't be good.


If I'm going to help you,
you're gonna have
to let me, okay?

(CLOTH TEARS)

Okay.

Huh.

Better?

Good. Nice to meet you.

I'm Mary.

Hey. You gonna bring
me up any more dishes?

You didn't tell me you had a donkey.
Huh?

I don't.

No, he must be a stray.

Go on, boy. Shoo!


You're scrappy.
Scrappy little donkey.

Come on.

All right, that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

(BONES CRACKING)




MARY: Oh!
(GROANS)

Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
It's just a...

Oh, well, I'm glad to see
that the donkey survived.

Poor little guy is hurt.

Give him a break.
JOSEPH: Hello!

Has anyone lost a donkey?

Because, if you have, he's here!
What should we call you?

And I do not want him!

How about...

Wait, what are you doing?
Boaz.

You're naming it?

What do you think, Bo?

Bo? Ugh. No way.

Bo's a good name
for you. Isn't it?

Isn't it?

Oh, yeah,
Bo's great. Love it.

Mary, no.

No, if you name him,
you're gonna start feeling
affectionate toward him.

And once you feel
affectionate, you're
gonna want to keep him.

And if there is one thing
we are definitely not
going to do...

Do you think he'll be
warm enough down here?

That's my workshop.

Let's just let him stay here
till he's all better.

Don't you think
we should at least...

Uh...

Uh...

Mmm.

Um...

Mary?

Come on.
Let's go talk upstairs.

Okay...

Finally. They are gone,
and I am out of here.




DAVE: Oh! There you are.

I am so glad you're okay.

Do you know how much
flying around I have
done looking for you?

I thought that maybe
the miller caught you
and was gonna eat you.

Eat me? Yeah, I don't think
he was gonna do that.

You don't know!
He had crazy in his eyes.

So keep it down.
He's still out
there someplace.

Do you think he heard?

Nah. I think we're good.

This is the last
place he'd check.

Nothing special ever happens
in an old shack like this.

The Messiah?

You're saying that baby
is the actual Messiah?

Like from the prophets?
I do need to sit down,
actually.


I know. I know how
it sounds, but yes.

And God wants you
and me to raise him.

Me? Are you sure, uh...

I mean, did
the angel mention me?

Well, no, but it's...

Look, I can't raise
the Son of God.

He's a king.
I'm just a carpenter.

He needs someone with a little
more experience being...

I don't know, king-ish?

I mean, who am I?


I am so sorry.

This is just so much
to take in right now.

Can I have a little time?

Okay. We got it this time.


We're making progress,
though, right?

Hate to say it,
but even if we got you out,

you're never gonna
make it to the royal
caravan on that leg.

Dave, look,
I don't want to hold you back.

You fly ahead without me.

I'll catch up once my leg heals.

No. We're in this together,
and I'm not gonna
leave you here.

Friends don't do that.
Are you sure?

Yeah, and besides, you'd
never make it without me.

I am a bird of the world.

I know how things
work out there.

You are a donkey of a barn.

A very small,
ill-smelling barn.

You need me.
Okay.

So, now what?

Hide out here
until your leg heals,

and then just get
yourself kicked out.

And we'll be back on track, pal.

Bo, actually.

My name is Bo now.
Mary named me.

&quot;Bo.&quot; Hmm.

That's got a nice
ring to... Wait.

That lady person named you?

I said hide here,
not settle in and get a name.

Have I taught you nothing?

No one is settling in, okay?

Once my leg is healed,
it's time for
Operation Kick Me Out.

Good. Now, I'm an expert
at this type of thing,
so listen up.

Things I found that tend
to tick people off.

Jumping out and scaring them.

Singing really loudly
early in the morning.

Staring at them while they eat.

At the risk of stating
the obvious,
a well-placed number two.

Breaking things.

Setting things on fire.

Licking things that
don't want to be licked.

<i>â™ªâ™ª What child is this</i>

I expected a left turn
two deserts ago.

FELIX: I'm dying back here!

I can't believe
we passed that last oasis.

I'm getting thirsty.

Lost! (SOBS)

These wise guys are lost.

Wise men don't get lost, Felix.

So you're saying they know
where this birthday party is?

And what makes you so certain
it's a birthday party?

Oh, here we go.

Have you seen the presents
these guys are bringing?

Gold, myrrh, frankincense.

Could be a baby shower.

You bring gifts to a baby shower.
Baby shower?

What is a baby gonna
do with frankincense,
silly camel?

It's a birthday party.

Mmm. Baby shower.

Birthday party.
Baby shower.

Birthday party.

Baby shower.
Birthday party!

What if it's not a party at all?

What if we're on
our way to do
something important

like, I don't know,
meeting the Son of God?

Uh-oh. Deborah's crazier
than a box of rocks.

I believe the expression is,
&quot;Dumb as a box of rocks.&quot;

FELIX: You ever shake
a box of rocks?

They sound crazy.

<i>â™ªâ™ª You're westward leading</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Still you're proceeding</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Guide us to the light â™ªâ™ª</i>


So floridly written.

It makes one wonder
how the emperor

has so much time
for counting his subjects.

But if Caesar decrees
a census, then
a census he will get.

Send the royal guard
to round up every
man and woman.

MAN: Sire.

Let the counting
of the sheep begin.

Your Majesty, three magi
bearing gifts for the king.


Hold it right there, camels.

(CAMELS EXCLAIM)

I bet they can play
that game we made up.

That was fun.
What was it called again?

&quot;How High.&quot; (SNICKERING)

On three. One, two...


Three!
(BOTH BARKING)

(CAMELS EXCLAIMING)

How high?
Camel high.

(DOGS WHINE)

Ah.

Your gifts are unexpected,
though not unwelcome.

Um, Your Majesty,
these gifts are not for you.

Yes, they're for the new king.

What new king?

The one foretold by the star.

I knew it.

It's a birthday party
for the new king.

No, no. I'm pretty certain
it's a baby shower.

Or maybe they're referring
to the coming Messiah.

The Son of God.

Okay, now I'm starting
to worry about her.

Deborah, are you okay?


How many hooves am I holding up?


Now bring in my scribes.

There is a prophecy.

What are they saying?
Shh.

I can't make it out,
but it's something about
the king of the... Shoes?

King of the shoes?
That's what this is about?

Mmm-mmm. That can't be right.
Whoa! Look!

Look! Dude has gold slippers.
King of the shoes, no doubt.

That, Felix, is money
and no taste.

Can we move past the shoes?

I think...
Yo, look at that guy.

You see him?
CYRUS: He's just the royal dog walker.

Trust me. Felix,
I know these things.

FELIX: What? Dog walker?

He's like a nightmare
wearing a helmet.

We must find this king at once.

I will set my scribes
to the task.

In the meantime, I invite
you to stay in the palace
as my royal guests.

No, no, that's
not necessary, sire.

Oh. But, I insist.

Okay. That was sinister.

Yep. We're leaving.

We're not gonna do
any slumber parties
with any evil shoe kings.

No, thank you.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

(SOLDIERS STOMPING)

(SOFTLY) Too late.
(SOLDIERS GRUNT)

This new king is a problem.


Get rid of the problem.


The room was filled
with magical light.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

And then the angel
said that the child
would be the new king.

ALL: (MURMURING) New king?

&quot;I'm not ready to be a mom.&quot;

But then I realized
the angel was talking
to the lady.

(ALL SHRIEKING)

Wait, wait. I'm not done.

That's usually everyone's
favorite part.

(GROWLING)
(SHUDDERING)

Whoa, whoa!


Nice story, rat.
Here's how it ends.

The end.

Rufus, spit it out.

We need that rat to talk.

Ho! I am not a rat.

I'm a pygmy jerboa.

What's a jerboa?

It is in the rodent family
but an entirely different
species.

Rufus, enough. Spit it out.


Aw! I was just starting
to get a little bit
of the flavor.


You've been telling this story
to every critter in Galilee.

Now it's our turn to hear it.

From the beginning.


Okay. Uh, well...
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

I was born in a sack of barley
somewhere in Capernaum.

Who's the woman?

Her name is Mary.
She lives in Nazareth.

But, please, don't hurt her.

She's really nice.

Don't worry.

We're harmless. (BARKING)

Hey! That's mine!


Oh, no.

Mary!

Looks like you're healed up.

Feeling better?

All I'm saying is
it's unfair, you know,

to make all these
people drop everything
for the census.

And for us to travel
to Bethlehem, especially
in your condition.

Joseph, I'm not dying.

It's just a little road trip.
We'll be fine.


This feels right.

You know, Mary,
most donkeys have to work.

You are spoiling him.

She is spoiling you.

Hey, look at you.

Your leg's all better.

Hey, Dave.

All right, time to activate
Operation Kick Me Out.

What's your plan of attack?

Uh, first, I thought
I'd let her finish
this belly rub.

Snap out of it!

A little bird named Methuselah

told me the royal caravan
will be passing through
not too far from here.

We can catch them
if we leave soon.

All right, let's get
kicked out of here.

JOSEPH: All packed up.
Is the donkey ready?

Yes, his leg looks good as new.

Finally. Time for him
to earn his keep.

All right, Bo, let's get you
hitched up to this cart

so you can take us to Bethlehem.
(BOTH GASPING)

Bethlehem?
Bethlehem?

DAVE: Not good, not good.

The royal caravan
is nowhere near Bethlehem.

Don't worry.
He's gotta catch me first.

Joseph, maybe if you just...

Don't worry, Mary.
I've got this.


Well, looks like you got me.

Come here!

Ha-ha!


Ooh! (LAUGHS)

That looked like it hurt.
It did.


Bo, look out!


Under control.


Joseph!
(PANTING)

No, no, I'm okay.

You know what?
We can walk to Bethlehem.

No problem.


Nicely done.

I thought so.

Did you see how I laid him
out on the ground?

Those caravan horses
have nothing on you.

Okay, so now what?

Easy. (CHUCKLES)

All we have to do
is slip through the gate

when they're on their way out.

No, no, no,
don't close the gate!

MARY: Don't worry.
We'll be back soon.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

BO: I guess that was good-bye?

You're not gonna cry, are you?

Come on, we gotta figure
out a way to open this thing.



This is what I get for
having a friend who can't fly.

You know what?
Gates were never
a problem before I met you.

There's gotta be something
we can use here.

There's that table,
that lumber, those tools.

A giant knife.

Hide!

Hmm.

(SHUDDERS)
Okay, Bo. What haven't you told me?

You been making some new friends?
No.

I bet the miller sent them
to bring me back to the mill.

(GASPS) They left the gate open.
BO: I'll make a run for it.

Dave, you jump out
and create a distraction.

What? No. Terrible plan.

Why don't you make
the distraction
and I run for it?

Because I'm the one trapped
in here, and you can fly,

as you like to keep telling me.
All valid points.


I smell a dog!

Thaddeus, there's
definitely a dog here.

Oh, yeah! Yeah! Oh...

I smell me.

Hey! Scary dogs!

You guys here for the show?

What show?
What...


&quot;What show?&quot;
the silly dog asks.

You're adorable.

&quot;The Dance of the Royal
Dove, &quot; of course.

Played in Rome six years.

Great reviews.

Caesar saw it twice.
Made him cry.

He won't admit that because,
you know, he's Caesar and all.

But he definitely cried
like a baby.

But I digress.
We don't have time for this.

No! Wait! The show
is about to start.

Okay. You can...

(DEEP INHALE)


What are you doing?
Don't watch me.
(CONTINUES HUMMING)

This bird can dance.



No, guys. Guys, guys, guys,
no, this is the best part.

Okay, there you go.
They're gone.

Where's your owner?

Yeah! Where's your owner?

Who, the miller?
I don't know a miller.

My owner's a nice
pregnant lady.
You would love her.

That's her.

Where is she?

Wait, you're looking for Mary?
Did I say &quot;pregnant lady&quot;?

I meant &quot;miller.&quot;

I'm just a mill donkey
on vacation.

Who's Mary?

Keep talking.

Okay, that was pathetic.
Let me handle this, Bo.

Guys, donkeys are stubborn.
Yeah.

He's not gonna tell you anything.
Sorry, guys.

You would have to
torture it out of him.

Wait, what?


He didn't bandage himself.

That's her scent.

Now we just gotta figure out
which way she went.

We'll tell her you said hello.
(SNICKERS)



Whoo! They left the gate open.

Okay. The royal caravan
is right this way.

We'll catch it in no time.

Wait. Where you going?
Dream is that way.

Right, but Mary is this way.

No, no, no, no.

Royal caravan cannot wait
for a rescue mission.

Especially when that guy
is after her.
He is major bad news.

I'm not gonna just
let her get hurt, Dave.

She was nice to me.

Aw, come on, Bo.

We've been waiting for this.

It'll just take a second.

Once Mary's safe,
we'll turn right around

and join the royal caravan.
(SIGHS)

Deal?


So we turn right around.

Okay, leave this to me.
I know a shortcut.


(THADDEUS SNICKERS)

He'll lead us right to her.

And then what?

Then we find the baby.

Oh. That baby messed
with the wrong dogs.

Nothing scares us.
Not even a baby.
Right, partner?

Just stop.

RUFUS: Thaddeus, do you think
I'm bad at being bad?



I got it.

Okay, Dave, be honest.
Are we lost?

No.

'Cause this doesn't exactly
look like the beaten path.

It's a shortcut. Trust me.



Bo? Bo, right here. Look at me, buddy.
(SHUDDERING)

Just breathe. Breathe.

Breathe.
(EXHALES)

Nope. That's it.

No more of your terrible
shortcuts. We are... Huh?

Hey, look. It's Mary.
That's them.

Guess we'll have to take
my terrible shortcut.

You're welcome.

Whoa, whoa. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Wait. No, no, no, no. Okay.

Come on. Really?

Which way am I supposed to go?

It's a cliff.
You go down.





Hi.
Could you help me get down, please?

Just let go.

Here, let me.

Wait, no, no, no.



I'm Ruth.

Hi, Ruth. I'm Bo.

Hey, Ruth?
You're a little close.

You know, personal space?

Oh! Sorry.

Flocking. It's a sheep thing.
(EXCLAIMING)

So, what are you doing
all alone on a cliff
like this?


Well, actually,
I'm here with my friend, Dave.

I'm meeting him at the bottom.
We're on the road to Bethlehem

so we can catch up with
my friend Mary and save her.

And once we do,
we will be joining
the royal caravan.

Ooh! Sounds exciting.

Huh?

Well, I guess I'll get back
to following the star.

The star? You mean the...

You mean that super bright one?
Yeah, that one.

Have you noticed how
it's been getting brighter?

Totally. And the weird way
it kind of pulsates.

Yes! It's like it's...

Like it means something.

Exactly.

Okay, come on.
We're almost down.
One more chasm.

This is really easy
for you, isn't it?

You got it, Bo.
Just don't look down.

Ooh... (EXCLAIMS)


Okay, great.
Now, just... Ooh!

Just try to get
your hooves in...

Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Spread-eagle. We're going
for a wedge thing here.

That's it. You got it.
You're a wedge.

How does that feel?

Fantastic.

Great. Okay. Next,
just lift that hoof
and take a step down.

Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No, no, no.

You can do it.
Just one hoof at a time.

That's it.



What is taking him so long?

Well, didn't exactly
stick the landing,
but that was good.

You're a fast learner.

Dave? Dave?

I'm under you
and in a lot of pain.

Dave?
Yeah. Right here. On your butt.

Come on. Let's get moving.




You must be Dave.
I've heard great
things about you.

I'm Ruth.
Pleasure.

Well, we've got places
to be, people to save,
caravans to join.

See you around.

Thanks, Ruth.

Have you, uh, ever been
to Bethlehem before?

We've never been
anywhere before.

Oh, well, you're in for a treat.

The Samaritan Mountains
are beautiful
this time of year.

Deadly steep, but great views.

You've been to Bethlehem?

Are you kidding?

I grew up around there.
I know all the ins and outs,

how to avoid predators
and treacherous high cliffs.

The treacherous cliffs.

You're not really considering
this, are you?

Come on, Ruth. Lead the way.

Sheep are usually
better at following,
but I will do my best.

Let's go, flock.

Yippee.

Felix, come on.

Shouldn't we be sneaking out?

Why are we sneaking in?

King Herod is up to something.

And we are gonna find out what.

With the help of a little
well-placed distraction.


Ooh! (GROANING)

fellas. Hurry.

Still no report from my hunter?

Has he found the child?


But your scribes are ready
to present their findings.

Well, finally,
someone's doing their job.

Ah, so tell me where he is.

According to the prophecy,
Your Majesty,

the new king is to be
born in Bethlehem.

And? That's all?
To what family?

Who are they? I am the king.

Huh. I am the king of Judea.

If you people can't
find this one child,

then I'll just have
to kill them all.

See? I told you.

Shall we send soldiers
to track him down?

Um, no.

You three, come.

It's the wise men.

Hide, quickly.

So, any word of the new king?

Yes. (CHUCKLES)

Look for him in Bethlehem.
You're free to go.

Our humblest thanks,
Your Majesty.

When you find him,
send word to me.

I dearly wish
to know where he is

so that I, too, may honor him...


With a gift.

You know, I think
he might be up to something.

He's using the wise men
to track down the new king.

Yeah! Plus, did you see him
crumple that flower?

BOTH: Shush!

We have to warn the new king.

Pack your bags, boys.

Looks like we're
going to Bethlehem.

And now our tour will
continue past these
pebbles on the path.

Watch your step.
Watch your step.
And watch your step.

I blame you for this.


Come on.




Are you sure you don't want
to sit in the cart?

No, it's hard enough
for you as it is.

Just let me fix my boot.

I don't believe it.

Really, I'm fine.

No, not that. That.

Bo?

Mary. You're in danger.

You need to listen to
what I'm about to say
extremely carefully.


You ever feel like he's
trying to talk to us?

Why is he here?
Where did he come from?

She's not getting it.

Okay, uh, new plan.

Can you two act like dogs?

What do you think?

Uh, yes. I do a great dog.

Dogs are my fourth best animal.

Great. Just follow my lead.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
&quot;Look at me. I'm Mary.
I'm so pregnant.&quot;

(IN DEEP VOICE)
&quot;I'm Joseph.
I'm in a bad mood.&quot;

Wait, wait, wait.
Is that supposed to be me?

It's totally you.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
&quot;Oh, no! Look!
Here come the dogs!&quot;


Oh. Oh! Uh...


Woof! Woof, woof, woof.

Throw me a stick,
and I'll bring it right back.

Oh, what's this?
It's a tail?

I'm gonna get you.
Seriously?

We're doing this
instead of the royal caravan?

No, Ruth, you're a scary dog.
Just be meaner.

Oh. Oh? Meaner?
You mean like...


(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh, no! They got me!

If only a certain donkey
had warned me.



There is something seriously
wrong with those animals.

I think Bo's trying
to tell us something.

Come on, come on.

I think he wants a belly rub.

What? No. I mean, yes,
always, but not now.

Ugh. This is not working.

Guys, I hate to break this up,
but we've got trouble.

Mama!

Those guys?

Yeah, they've been
following us since
we came down the cliff.

Couldn't you have pointed
that out sooner?

Oh, no. They followed
us right to her.

Well, why don't we hide
in that big flock over there?

That's what a sheep would do.

Yes. Great idea.

MARY: Bo, what are you...

Joseph?
Right behind you.

Oh, okay.

Wow, you must be really thirsty.

I'm gonna grab some water.
Do you want some?

Sure. Yeah, I guess
I'll just take a look
at that wheel, then.

Don't carry too much, okay?

I won't.

Oh! Sorry.

Fresh figs! Get your fresh
figs here. I got them.

Hello, sir. You look like
a man who appreciates
fine pottery.

I... (CHOKING)

MARY: Hurry up. We need
three buckets of water.

Do you see anything?

What are we looking for?

What... (GROANS)

Here we are, minutes away
from being chopped

into tiny little pieces
by a knife-wielding psycho.

We could've been
riding with royalty.

Look! They're here.

Dave, let's try
and lead them away.

Ruth, you stay here
and guard Mary.

If they find her,
get our attention.

Yeah. We should
have a secret signal.

Sounds great.

(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

Help me.


Oh.

Oh, gosh. The signal. Okay.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

(IMITATES BRAYING)

Huh?


Hmm.

Oh, no.
I'll take care of this.

Looks like it's up to me.

Ha-ha!

too big. Too big.

Ruth, looks like it's up to you.
Me?

I knew this day would come.

For the flock! (GROANS)


Huh?

(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

(BO PANTING)

MAN: Look out!
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

No!

MAN: Get back! Get back!

(WOMAN SHRIEKS)


WOMAN: Watch out!


MAN: Hold it up!

WOMAN: No!


Yes!

Bo, are you okay?


What has gotten into you?

WOMAN: That donkey did it.

He destroyed everything.

Did you do this?

WOMAN: It was the donkey.

WOMAN 2: Who owns that?

Oh, boy.

We stopped him!

That went great, right?

DAVE: Hey, you big mutts!

Come here.
Hope your boss knows how to swim.

You want some of this?


What's the matter,
guys? All tied up?


That's it, you're dead.

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

I hate that dancing bird.

I know. He's so talented.


Huh?


MARY: Joseph.
No, no.

I do not want that donkey
near you or the baby.

Go! Get out of here!

Joseph, it's fine.

Fine?

Mary, this is not
going well, all right?

I just promised four people
I'd repair the carts
that he smashed.

Yeah, trying to save her life.

Maybe if you pulled the cart,
Joseph would want you to stay.

JOSEPH: No, he is just
too much to deal with.

MARY: He's just a donkey.

&quot;Just a donkey&quot;? Yeah, he is.
Just a good-for-nothing donkey

that has only ever
brought us trouble.

Come on, Dave. Let's go.

Where are we going?
Where do you think?

To join the royal caravan.

Where we'll finally
do something important.


Hey, Bo, wait a minute.
What about the star?

It means something.
You said so yourself.

You follow the star.
I'm done with that.

But what about our tiny flock?

Flocks stick together.

We're not a flock.

I never should
have followed you.

Bo?

Bo!

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Hmm...

(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

We're gonna die.
We're gonna die!

We're gonna live.
We're gonna live!


Someone's gonna die.

<i>â™ªâ™ª Why should
I feel discouraged?</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Why should the shadows come?</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Why should
my heart be lonely?</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª And long for
Heaven and home?</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª I sing because I'm happy</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª I sing because I'm free</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª His eye is on the sparrow</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª And I know He watches me â™ªâ™ª</i>

(BELLS JINGLING)


Is that the royal caravan?

I can see them!

(BO PANTING)

Whoa!

Huh?

DAVE: Royal
caravan-van-van-van-van!

The royal caravan! Whoo-hoo!

Dave?
(LAUGHING)

I don't think I can go with you.

Of course you can.
What do you mean?

Look, um...

I know we've always
talked about joining
the royal caravan,

being a part
of something important,

but now that we're here,
I don't think this is it.

You know, Mary may
not be big and royal,

but she's important.

She's important to me.

I know this was our dream,

and even though I can't come,
I think you should go.

Say hi to the horses for me.

Oh, come on.
No, really, I mean it.

Bo, yes, you're right.

The royal caravan was our dream.

But the best part was
that it was gonna be us.

If all I wanted was
to flap around a bunch
of fancy wagons,

I could have gone and done
that a long time ago.

I mean, I can fly, you know?
You realize that?

Yeah. I guess so.

Look, you lead the way,
and wherever you go,

your best friend Dave
will be right behind you.

You ready?


No, no, no, no, no.

Let me help.

Mary, you're in
no condition to help.

Stop saying that.

I'm fine.
No, you are not fine.

None of this is fine.

Joseph, God chose us.

But why? Why us?

Look at us. We'll be lucky
just to make it to Bethlehem.

And we're supposed
to raise the Son of God?

Uh, this must be
part of God's plan.

Well, so far,
this plan is going great.

I can't wait to see
what happens next.

<i>â™ªâ™ª Mary, did you know</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª That your baby boy
will one day walk on water?</i>

What are you looking at?

<i>â™ªâ™ª Mary, did you know</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª That your baby boy will
save our sons and daughters?</i>

Lord, I can't do this.

All right? I am not
the father of a king.

I'm just a carpenter.
Please, give me a sign.

<i>â™ªâ™ª This child that you
delivered will soon
deliver you</i>

Huh. (CHUCKLES) Really?

The donkey?

Hey.

Stop it.

<i>â™ªâ™ª Mary, did you know? â™ªâ™ª</i>

Mary?

BO: Hi, Ruth.

Look, I'm sorry
for what I said back there.

It was mean, and...

I'm glad we followed you.

You know, that night
I saw the star,

I tried to get my old flock
to follow me,

but they wouldn't.

And so I struck out on my own,

which has been hard
'cause, well, I'm a sheep.

Thank you for coming back.

Can you help me with these?

Of course! You're back!

Oh, sorry, personal space.

Ah, come here.


Are you okay? I am so sorry.

You were right.

I was? About what?


Trust me, I know it is.

Just because God has
a plan doesn't mean
it's going to be easy.

And that scares me.

Hey. I'm scared, too.

But I'm here. And I am yours.

And I will give
everything that I have

to keep you and the baby safe.

I mean, I may not have a lot...


Oh. Speaking of which,
what happened
to all our stuff?

Oh. Uh...


(MARY GASPS)


JOSEPH: I always
liked that donkey.

I always did. I didn't say
it enough. That's true.

Ah. Ooh! Hello. (GROANS)

Did the baby kick?

No, that was
something different.

Different? What &quot;different&quot;?
Like, baby's coming now?

We've got some time,
but, yeah, I think so.

Okay! Nobody panic!
I've got the clothes.
I've got the bag.

I've got the sheep.
Why do I have the sheep?

Bo, can you carry her?

<i>â™ªâ™ª One dark night</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Something said
follow the light</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª So you look up
and see the word</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª That's written upon the sky</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Strong and wise</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Keeping the Lord
as your guide</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª And through the doubt
you realize</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª He's with you all the while</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Follow that star above you</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª But His love's
just a breath away</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª If you follow your heart,

<i>â™ªâ™ª Follow that star</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª If you follow your heart,
follow the light</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Follow that star â™ªâ™ª</i>

(THUNDER CRACKING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

<i>â™ªâ™ª I have traveled</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Many moonless nights</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Cold and weary</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª With a babe inside</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª And I wonder</i>

All right. Shall we?

<i>â™ªâ™ª What I've done â™ªâ™ª</i>


All right, buddy,
just wait here,

and we'll be back
out in a second.

DAVE: And they're inside.


Thank goodness.
This has been so stressful.

how we held it together.

RUTH: Well, we made it.

Safe and sound in
Bethlehem. (CHUCKLES)

Something's not right.

Oh! Excuse me.

Huh?


You.

No, no, no.

Easy. Easy, boy.

It's okay.

Just hold still.

Let me go!

No, you don't, crazy-eyed,
donkey-eating miller.

That's my best friend!
(GRUNTS)

Move on!
Dave!

Dave, are you okay?

Where did they go?
Who was that?

Bad news.

I'm sorry. The inn is full.
What?

But, no, can't you see
she's about to have a child?

What can I do?
Blame the census.

Uh... You know what?
We will pay double.

Just hold that thought.

I'll be right back.

Um, I left the money with Bo.
Joseph?

Bo?

Where's Bo?

Joseph, we're running
out of time!

Mary.


Bo, where are you?

Ruth, I know we have had
our personal issues,

but we need to set them
aside and find Bo.

We have personal issues?

Dave, I think you are a delight.

I am a delight.
Thank you for noticing.

Okay, time to activate
Operation Rescue Bo.


She's here.

Down the street. Try them.

You don't understand.
We just came from there.


Where do we go now?
(INHALES SHARPLY)

We will find a place.
We just have to keep looking.

So this is Bethle-ham.

It is pronounced &quot;Bethle-hem.&quot;

That's what I said.
&quot;Bethle-ham.&quot; - &quot;Hem.&quot;

&quot;Hem.&quot; As if you're
clearing your throat.

Boys.
That's what I've been saying.

You need to get your ears checked.
Boys, focus.

The new king's in danger.

Right. Let's go find him.


They've secured our restraints.

Yeah, and they tied us up, too.

We have to find the new king.

Wise men indeed.

Okay, okay, think.
What do kings look like?

In most cultures,
a king is set apart
from the plebeians

with an ornamental headdress.

A ornamel what?

They wear hats.

Ooh?

for you, Your Majesty!

Run for your life!

(GRUNTING)
(SHRIEKS)

Run like the wind!
Will you cut that out?

We'll never find
him tied up here.

We have to go out and search.
That's it.

I'm biting through the reins.

Don't you dare.

That is fine Corinthian leather.

Do you have any idea
how much that cost?

You kidding me?
No, he's right.


Well, we'll have to untie
these knots ourselves.

Just follow my instructions.

First, Felix, we'll need
you in he middle.

Deborah, on the left.

Excuse me. Pardon me.
No.

Let me... Move.
No. Over.

Would you move?
The other way.

Sorry about that. Sorry. My bad.
I got it.

Move.
No, around.

No, the other...

The other left.
Stop!

Would you stop pinching me?

(GRUNTING)
(BRAYING)

Come on. Come on.

No, no, no.
Don't do this. Please!



I can't let them down.

I could try praying.

Let's see, um...

Okay, how did Mary do this?

Never mind. (SIGHS)

It's fine.

God? Hello?

Um, I don't really
know how this works

or if You listen
to prayers from donkeys,

but I've seen Mary
do this many times,

and I don't know
what else to do.

My friends need help.

I thought,
if I followed the star,

it would lead me to
where I'm supposed to be,

but I failed them.

What do you want me to do?


ZACH: Begone! Away with you!


Huh! Now it's talking back.

There's nothing to fear, Zach.

It's all a figment
of your imagination.

This really realistic
vision of a donkey
who's talking to God

and won't stop eyeballing you.

EDITH: Zach.
(SHRIEKS)

Pull yourself together.

Ow!
What's your name, sweetie?

Bo.

Bo is a funny word.

Bo, Bo, Bo.

Bo, Bo.
What?

(SING-SONG) Bo, Bo!
He has a name?

And she's singing him a song?
I'm doomed.

Bo!
I kind of like that.

They're not usually like this.

You caught us at a bad time.

in nine months.

Nine months?
Not a wink.

Oh! So that
explains your eyes.

What? What's wrong
with my eyes?

Nothing.

Yep, no sleep at all

since that giant
night light turned on.

Light?

All you can do is lie awake
and listen to the crickets.

Ta-da.

(SINGING GRACEFULLY)

Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)

Sorry. So excited.

Zach and Edith don't
like the spotlight,

but I think it's beautiful.

It's here.

I can't believe this.

Me, neither.

You don't understand.
That light, that's the star.

This is where it's
been leading me.

But Mary... Joseph...

Guys, I gotta get out of here.


Can you help me?

I got you.
I'm gonna chew him free.


Woody.
No. Try biting the...

I know! I'll sing you free.


That was beautiful,
but not helpful.

a splinter in my tongue.

(SINGING)
(GRUNTING)

Step aside.

(ZACH GRUNTING)


Yes, yes! That's perfect.

Now I just gotta
get past that gate.


Uh...

Has that ever worked for you?

No, actually.

Come on. Up you go.

Thanks, guys.

Gotta run.
Mary's having a baby!

A baby?
I love babies.

Bring 'em back here.
There's plenty of
room in the stable.

Great. Now we'll never sleep.


Huh? What?

No, no, no, no.

Bo, buddy, where are you?

Bo, are you there?

Bo? Bo!

Bo! Oh, hey, Bo.


Ruth.
You're here.

Dave.
We've gotta help Mary and Joseph.

I know. Where are they?

Yeah, we hadn't gotten that far.

The dogs are here.
We can't take them on our own.

We need to find help.

You can count on us!

We won't let you down!

(CHOKING)
(BARKING)

They went that way.



What are we doing?
We're not gonna stop
those giant, scary dogs

with a fluffy sheep
and a tiny donkey.

Even with a very masculine
and brave dove.

We need backup.

Where do you find a dog-eating
hippopotamus in Bethlehem?


A three-headed camel? Nice.

Help! Help!

Help! Anybody!

Oh, look, a flock of sheep.

That kind of looks like my...

That's my flock.

Help. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Is there anybody else?

No? Okay.

Bo needs my help.

Okay, you can do this.
Here we go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey, everybody.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

What's up?

It's me, Ruth.


I know you guys think
I was crazy to leave
and follow the star,

but you wouldn't believe
all the adventures
I've had out there.

And the biggest one of all
is happening tonight.

I've made new friends,
and they need our help.

So, this time,
you gotta follow me.

Guys?

This is important!
(THUNDER CRACKS)

(SHEEP GASP)


VOICE: Fear not.

I bring good tidings
of great joy.

For unto you is born
this day a savior,

Christ, the Lord.

(ALL EXCLAIM)

Told ya it was important.

I'm sorry. There's no room.

Sorry.

I'm... I'm sorry.

Joseph, I can't go any further.

All right, all right, Mary, here.
(GROANING)

Just...

Here. Lay here.

Mary? Mary, look at me.

You're doing great.

Remember, God chose
us for a reason.

This must be part of His plan.


Help us. Help us.

Please, God, help us.

Mary! Joseph!

(DOGS BARKING)

Not good.

No, no, no, no,
that's not good at all.


Bo?
Bo? You're back!




Buddy, we need somewhere to go.

Mary, let's go.




(MARY WHIMPERING)

Guys, guys.

I found them.
We're all set.

It's not much, but
there's plenty of light.

No, no, no,
this isn't gonna work.

We can't have the baby here.

Mary, we need stronger bedding.

You know, we need warmer...
Joseph.

It's time.


Thank you.

Well, well...

Look who it is.

eaten him the first
time we met him.

But, Rufus, if we had eaten him,

he would never have led us here.

We've been meaning to thank you.

Now, be a good little donkey
and run along.

You've served your purpose.

You guys are...
You guys are pretty scary.

Yeah. And you might be
stronger than I am.

But if you wanna
get to my friends,

you're gonna have
to get past me first.

No problem, donkey!

Getting past you
is my middle name.

What is that?

What's what? I wasn't
supposed to look, was I?

Donkey kick!

You just made a big mistake.



You're mine!





Not gonna let you do this!


No, no, no, no, no.

No. Mary! Joseph!

Mary.

I'm sorry.

Huh?
Huh?

For the flock!

(SHEEP SHOUTING)

(DAVE SHOUTING)

Whoo-hoo!

Coming at you, bro!


I don't wanna die!

Somebody, help.

It's just another cliff.

Grab hold of this.

Come on.

(BABY CRYING)

(BOTH WHIMPERING)



DAVE: Bo?

Bo, you're doing it.

Excellent climbing form, Bo.

Be the wedge.



You don't have to be.

You're free now.

Bo, where are you going?

We've got a baby to meet.

Come on.

After all that,
it is a baby shower.

You were right the whole time.

You had it right as well.
It is a birthday party.

Literally, it's the day
of his birth.

Mmm-hmm. I'm gonna let 'em
have this one.

(BABY CRYING)

<i>â™ªâ™ª Holy</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Holy</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª O holy night</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª The stars are
brightly shining</i>

Whoa.

<i>â™ªâ™ª It is the night</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Of our dear Savior's birth</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Long lay the world</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª In sin and error pining...</i>

Hey, little guy.

(BABY SNEEZES)

It's okay, Bo.

<i>â™ªâ™ª A thrill of hope</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª The weary world rejoices</i>

Everybody, everybody, listen up.

There's this huge guy
with two dogs coming
after Mary,

and if we don't do
something now, then
the baby's not gonna...

Oh. Looks like...

Looks like you guys handled it.

Sweet.

This seat taken?

BO: Everyone,

this is Mary and Joseph.

And that's their new baby.

The flock is growing.

No. Not happening.
Don't even think about it.

It's okay. Let them in.

(BABY COOS)

Look with your eyes.

See?

He's just a baby.

Aw. Look at him.

Thaddeus, are we good dogs now?

We have to try.

Um...

Is...

Uh, I'm sorry.
Is this your stable?

(WISE MEN CHUCKLE)
No, no, no.

We've come to
honor the new king.

I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES)

King? Where? What, uh...

What is he talking
about? A king?

What's his name?

His name is Jesus.

For Jesus, gold.

Myrrh.

Do you guys like frankincense?

what to get.

Thank you.

For the newborn king.

â™ªâ™ª<i> A thrill of hope</i>


<i>â™ªâ™ª The weary world rejoices</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª For yonder breaks</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª A new and glorious morn</i>

<i>â™ªâ™ª Fall on your knees</i>

Guys, I carried
a king on my back.

We're never gonna hear
the end of this, are we?

And I hope we never do.

You know, I think people
are gonna remember this night.

What happened here
around this manger

will be celebrated
for thousands of years.

Families will come together

and exchange presents
and sing carols.

All to remember the grace
of this moment that we
are witnessing right now.


Okay, Deborah.

She's back to talking
crazy again.

DEBORAH: Mmm-hmm.

(COOING)
(MARY SHUSHING)

Hey. It's okay.

Thank you.
