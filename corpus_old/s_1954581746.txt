BAKER: Once upon a time-in
a far-off kingdom-

there lay a small village at
the edge of the woods...

CINDERELLA: I WISH...
And in this village...

CINDERELLA: MORE THAN ANYTHING...
...lived a young maiden...

CINDERELLA: MORE THAN LIFE... MORE THAN JEWELS...
...a care-free young lad...

I WISH...

MORE THAN LIFE...
...and a childless baker...

I WISH...
...with his Wife.

MORE THAN ANYTHING...
MORE THAN THE MOON...

I WISH...
THE KING IS GIVING A FESTIVAL.

MORE THAN LIFE...
I WISH... I WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL

MORE THAN RICHES...
AND THE BALL... I WISH

MY COW WOULD GIVE US SOME MILK.
MORE THAN ANYTHING...

I WISH WE HAD A CHILD

I WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL MY COW WOULD
GIVE US SOME MILK OR EVEN CHEESE... I WISH.

STEPMOTHER: YOU WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL?
BAKER: The poor girlâ€™s parents had died

YOU, CINDERELLA, THE FESTIVAL?
YOU WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL?

THE FESTIVAL?! THE
KINGâ€™S FESTIVAL!??

BAKER: And now she lived with her
stepmother...

THE FESTIVAL?!!!

BAKER: ...who had two daughters of her own.

FLORINDA: LOOK AT YOUR NAILS!
LUCINDA: LOOK AT YOUR DRESS!

STEPMOTHER: PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AT YOU!
CINDERELLA: NEVERTHELESS

STEPMOTHER/STEPSISTERS/CINDERELLA: SHE/YOU/I
STILL WANT(S)/ WISH TO GO THE FESTIVAL...

AND DANCE BEFORE THE
PRINCE?!

BAKER: All three were beautiful of face,
but vile and black of heart.

The young lad had no father,

and his mother...
I WISH.

BAKER: Well, she was at her witâ€™s end.

JACKâ€™S MOTHER: I WISH
MY SON WERE NOT A FOOL.

I WISH MY HOUSE WAS NOT A MESS.

I WISH THE COW WAS FULL OF MILK.

I WISH THE WALLS WERE FULL OF GOLD.

I WISH A LOT OF THINGS.

What in heavenâ€™s name are you doing
with the cow inside the house?

I thought if he was nice and warm
he might produce some milk.

Itâ€™s a she! How many times must I tell you?
Only shes can give milk!

BAKER: And then there was
a hungry little girl...

who always wore a red cape...
BAKER: Hey!

I WISH. ITâ€™S NOT FOR ME, ITâ€™S
FOR MY GRANNY IN THE WOODS.

A LOAF OF BREAD, PLEASE, TO BRING MY
POOR OLD HUNGRY GRANNY IN THE WOODS...

JUST A LOAF OF BREAD...

PLEASE.

if you can pick up these lentils
and finish your chores in time,

-then you may go to the ball with us.

Come along, ladies...
STEPSISTERS: Yes, Mother.

GOOD LUCK!

CINDERELLA: COME LITTLE BIRDS, DOWN FROM THE EAVES AND
THE LEAVES, OVER FIELDS, OUT OF CASTLES AND PONDS...

AHHHHH...
JACK: NO, SQUEEZE, PAL...

CINDERELLA: QUICK, LITTLE
BIRDS, FLICK THROUGH THE ASHES.

PICK AND PECK,
BUT SWIFTLY, SIFT THROUGH THE ASHES.

INTO THE POT...

Bullseye!
What are you doing?

-Stop your pretending!

Now listen to me well, son.
Milky-White must be taken to market.

Mother, no! heâ€™s the
best cow in the world!

Was. Sheâ€™s been dry for weeks. Weâ€™ve no
food or money and no choice but to sell her.

But Milky-White is my best friend!
Look at her!

THERE ARE BUGS ON HER DUGS.

THERE ARE FLIES IN HER EYES.

THEREâ€™S A LUMP ON HER RUMP
BIG ENOUGH TO BE A HUMP!
But...

JACKâ€™S MOTHER: WEâ€™VE NO
TIME TO SIT AND DITHER

WHILE HER WITHERS WITHER WITH HER...

AND NO ONE KEEPS A COW FOR A FRIEND!

Sometimes I wonder
whatâ€™s in that head of yours.

LRRH: INTO THE WOODS, ITâ€™S TIME TO GO

I HATE TO LEAVE, I HAVE TO, THOUGH.

INTO THE WOODS. ITâ€™S TIME, AND SO I
MUST BEGIN MY JOURNEY.

INTO THE WOODS AND THROUGH THE TREES
TO WHERE I AM EXPECTED, MAâ€™AM.

INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHERâ€™S HOUSE...

LRRH:(with her mouth full)
INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHERâ€™S
HOUSE...

-Youâ€™re certain of your way?

LRRH: THE WAY IS CLEAR. THE LIGHT IS GOOD,
I HAVE NO FEAR, NOR NO ONE SHOULD.

THE WOODS ARE JUST TREES,
THE TREESARE JUST WOOD.

I SORT OF HATE TO ASK IT,
BUT DO YOU HAVE A BASKET?

I donâ€™t suppose youâ€™re planning on
buying any of these?

-Now, donâ€™t stray and be late!
-And you might save some of those
sweets for Granny.

Oh my G...
she's a...

LRRH: INTO THE WOODS AND DOWN THE DELL,
THE PATH IS STRAIGHT, I KNOW IT WELL.

INTO THE WOODS, AND WHO CAN TELL
WHATâ€™S WAITING ON THE JOURNEY?

INTO THE WOODS TO BRING SOME BREAD TO
GRANNY WHO IS SICK IN BED.

NEVER CAN TELL WHAT LIES AHEAD,
FOR ALL THAT KNOW, SHEâ€™S ALREADY DEAD.

BUT INTO THE WOODS, INTO THE WOODS,
INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHERâ€™S
HOUSE AND HOME BEFORE DARK!

LUCINDA: Cinderella!
FLORINDA: Get up here!

FLY BIRDS, BACK TO THE SKY,

BACK TO THE EAVES AND THE LEAVES AND
THE FIELDS AND THE...

HURRY UP AND DO MY HAIR, CINDERELLA!
ARE YOU REALLY WEARING THAT?

HERE, I FOUND A LITTLE TEAR,
CINDERELLA! CANâ€™T YOU HIDE IT WITH A HAT?

YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
I know.

She means me.
No, she didnâ€™t!

CINDERELLA: MOTHER SAID BE GOOD,
FATHER SAID BE NICE,

THAT WAS ALWAYS THEIR ADVICE.
SO BE NICE, CINDERELLA, GOOD,
CINDERELLA, NICE

GOOD GOOD NICE...
Tighter!

WHATâ€™S THE GOOD OF BEING GOOD
IF EVERYONE IS BLIND

ALWAYS LEAVING YOU
BEHIND? NEVER MIND,

CINDERELLA, KIND CINDERELLA,
NICE-GOOD-NICE-KIND-GOOD-NICE

-Ow! Not that tight! Clod!

Who might that be?
Weâ€™ve sold our last loaf of bread!

-Itâ€™s the Witch from next door!

We have no bread.
I donâ€™t want your bread.

Then what is it you wish?
Itâ€™s not what I wish. Itâ€™s what you wish.

Nothing cooking in that belly now,
is there?

And there will never be...
Unless you do exactly as I say.

In three daysâ€™ time, a
Blue Moon will appear.

Only then can the curse be undone.

What curse?

The one I placed on this house!
What are you talking about?

In the past, when you were no more
than a babe,

your father brought his
young wife and you to this cottage.

They were a lovely couple.
But not lovely neighbors.

You see, your mother...

was with child and she developed an
unusual appetite.

She admired my beautiful garden...

and she told your father that
what she wanted, more than anything...

in the world was...
GREENS, GREENS, AND NOTHING BUT GREENS:

PARSLEY, PEPPERS, CABBAGES AND CELERY. ASPARAGUS
AND WATERCRESS AND FIDDLEFERNS AND LETTUCE...!

HE SAID, â€œALL RIGHT,â€ BUT IT WASNâ€™T, QUITE,
â€˜CAUSE I CAUGHT HIM IN THE AUTUMN
IN MY GARDEN ONE NIGHT!

HE WAS ROBBING ME, RAPING ME,
ROOTING THROUGH MY RUTABAGA,
RAIDING MY ARUGULA.

AND RIPPING UP THE RAMPION
MY CHAMPION! MY FAVORITE!
I SHOULD HAVE LAID A SPELL ON HIM
RIGHT THERE...

I COULD HAVE TURNED HIM INTO STONE

OR A DOG OR A CHAIR...

BUT I LET HIM HAVE THE RAMPION
Iâ€™D LOTS TO SPARE.
IN RETURN, HOWEVER,

I SAID, â€œFAIR IS FAIR: YOU CAN LET ME
HAVE THE BABY THAT YOUR WIFE WILL BEAR,

AND WEâ€™LL CALL IT SQUARE.â€

I had a brother?
No.

But you had a sister.

-Where is she?

Sheâ€™s mine...

now and youâ€™ll never find her!

Small price to pay for what else
your father stole from me.

It cost me my youth, my beauty. My mother warned me she would
punish me with the curse of ugliness if I ever lost them.

Lost what?
The beans!

Beans?
THE SPECIAL BEANS!
I LET HIM GO, I DIDNâ€™T KNOW
HEâ€™D STOLEN MY BEANS!

I WAS WATCHING HIM CRAWL BACK
OVER THE WALL, WHEN BANG! CRASH!
THE LIGHTNING FLASH!

WELL, THATâ€™S ANOTHER STORY...
NEVER MIND. ANYWAY,

AT LAST THE BIG DAY CAME

AND I MADE MY CLAIM â€OH, DONâ€™T TAKE AWAY
THE BABYâ€ THEY SHRIEKEDAND SCREECHED,

BUT I DID, AND I HID HER WHERE SHEâ€™LL
NEVER BE REACHED.

AND YOUR FATHER CRIED
AND YOUR MOTHER DIED

WHEN FOR EXTRA MEASURE...
I ADMIT IT WAS A PLEASURE...
I SAID, â€œSORRY, Iâ€™M STILL NOT MOLLIFIED.â€

AND I LAID A LITTLE SPELL ON THEM...

YOU TOO, SON... THAT YOUR FAMILY TREE
WOULD ALWAYS BE A BARREN ONE...

How could you do that to me?
And when your mother died...

...your father deserted you.
Your father was no father...

...so why should you be?
Iâ€™m so sorry...

Iâ€™m so sorry... NOW THEREâ€™S NO MORE FUSS AND THEREâ€™S NO MORE
SCENES AND MY GARDEN THRIVES. YOU SHOULD SEE MY NECTARINES!

BUT Iâ€™M TELLING YOU THE SAME I TELL KINGS AND QUEENS:
DONâ€™T EVER NEVER EVER MESS AROUND WITH MY GREENS!

ESPECIALLY THE BEANS.

Why do I have to go to the next village?
Because everyone in this village...

...knows the cow hasnâ€™t given a drop of milk in weeks.
But thatâ€™s cheating.

Weâ€™re starving, Jack.
Donâ€™t you understand that?

Now, Youâ€™re not to take less
than five pounds for her.

Are you listening to me?
Yes.

How much are you to ask?
No more than five pounds.

Less! Than five.
... than five!

INTO THE WOODS, THE TIME IS NOW. WE
HAVE TO LIVE, I DONâ€™T CARE HOW.

INTO THE WOODS TO SELL THE COW, YOU MUST
BEGIN THE JOURNEY.

STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE WOODS AND DONâ€™T DELAY

WE HAVE TO
FACE THE MARKETPLACE

INTO THE WOODS
TO JOURNEYâ€™S END...

INTO THE WOODS TO SELL A FRIEND...

YOU WISH TO HAVE THE CURSE REVERSED?

Iâ€™LL NEED A CERTAIN POTION FIRST.
GO TO THE WOOD AND BRING ME BACK

ONE:
THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,

TWO: THE CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,

THREE: THE HAIR
AS YELLOW AS CORN,

FOUR: THE SLIPPER
AS PURE AS GOLD.

BRING ME THESE
BEFORE THE CHIME OF MIDNIGHT...

IN THREE DAYSâ€™ TIME, â€˜TIS
THEN THE BLUE MOON REAPPEARS,

WHICH COMES BUT ONCE EACH
HUNDRED YEARS. BRING THEM...

AND I GUARANTEE, A CHILD AS PERFECT AS
CHILD CAN BE.

-Go to the wood!

-Ladies. Our carriage awaits!

NOW MAY I GO TO THE FESTIVAL?

The Festival! DARLING, THOSE NAILS!
DARLING, THOSE CLOTHES!

LENTILS ARE ONE THING, BUT DARLING, WITH THOSE, YOUâ€™D
MAKE US THE FOOLS OF THE FESTIVAL AND MORTIFY THE PRINCE!

-The festival lasts three nights.
Surely you can let me be there for one
of them.

The King is trying to find his son a
wife...

not a scullery maid! We must
be gone!

-Go!

I WISH

-I found. Here. Take this...

Iâ€™m not wearing that.
Why?

It was my fatherâ€™s. You heard what she
said.

This is all his fault.
I want nothing to do with him!

Beans.

It must be the Witchâ€™s beans!

Weâ€™ll take them with us.
We?

Wait a minute!

Youâ€™re not coming. Itâ€™s not safe out there.
I can help you.

No. I can do this on my own.

THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE. ONLY I CAN LIFT
THE SPELL, THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE.

NO, NO, THE SPELL IS ON OUR HOUSE. WE MUST LIFT
THE SPELL TOGETHER, THE SPELL IS ON OUR HOUSE.

Now tell me. What am I to return with?

You donâ€™t remember?!

THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,

THE CAPE AS
RED AS BLOOD,

THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS
CORN, THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS GOLD.

THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK, THE CAPE AS
RED AS BLOOD,

THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS
CORN,

THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS GOLD.

I STILL WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL,

BUT HOW AM I EVER TO GET TO THE
FESTIVAL?

I KNOW... Iâ€™LL VISIT MOTHERâ€™S
GRAVE, THE GRAVE AT THE
WILLOW TREE,

AND TELL HER I
JUST WANT TO GO TO THE KINGâ€™S
FESTIVAL...

INTO THE WOODS, ITâ€™S TIME TO GO, IT
MAY BE ALL IN VAIN, YOU (I) KNOW.

INTO THE WOODS... BUT EVEN SO, I HAVE
TO TAKE THE JOURNEY.

-INTO THE WOODS/ THE PATH IS STRAIGHT,
YOU KNOW IT WELL,
-BUT WHO CAN TELL...?

INTO THE WOODS TO LIFT THE SPELL...

INTO THE WOODS TO VISIT MOTHER...

-INTO THE WOODS TO SELL THE COW...

TO GET THE MONEY!...
TO GO THE FESTIVAL...

INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHERâ€™S
HOUSE...

INTO THE WOODS TO
GRANDMOTHERâ€™S HOUSE...

THE WAY IS CLEAR, THE LIGHT IS GOOD.

I HAVE NO FEAR, NOR NO ONE SHOULD.

THE WOODS ARE JUST TREES,
THE TREES ARE JUST WOOD.

NO NEED TO BE AFRAID THERE...
THEREâ€™S SOMETHING IN THE GLADE THERE.

INTO THE WOODS WITHOUT DELAY, BUT
CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE THE WAY.

INTO THE WOODS, WHO KNOWS WHAT
MAY BE LURKING ON THE JOURNEY?

INTO THE WOODS TO GET THE THING
THAT MAKES IT WORTH THE JOURNEYING.

INTO THE WOODS
TO SEE THE KING...
TO SELL THE COW...

TO MAKE THE POTION...
TO SEE... TO SELL... TO GET...

TO
BRING TO MAKE... TO LIFT... TO GO TO
THE FESTIVAL...! INTO THE WOODS!

INTO THE WOODS! INTO
THE WOODS,

THEN OUT OF THE WOODS,
AND HOME BEFORE DARK!

BAKER: Deep within the woods,

Cinderella had planted a branch
at the grave of her mother.

And she visited there so
often, and wept so much,

that her tears watered it until
it had become a magnificent tree.

I WISH...

Câ€™S MOTHER: What is it
that you wish, child?

DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WISH? ARE YOU
CERTAIN WHAT YOU WISH IS WHAT YOU
WANT?

IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,
THEN MAKE A WISH...

ASK THE TREE,

AND YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH.

Thank you, Mother.

On her path to Grannyâ€™s, the little
girl suddenly found herself...

in a very unusual part of the wood.

WOLF: Good day, young lady.

-Good day, Mr. Wolf.

Whither away so hurriedly?
To my Grandmotherâ€™s.

And what might be in your basket?
Itâ€™s bread for Grandmother...

so sheâ€™ll have something
good to make her strong.

And where might your Grandmother live?
A quarter of a league further in the woods;

her house stands inside a great oak tree.

MMMMH... UNHH...

LOOK AT THAT FLESH,
PINK AND PLUMP.

HELLO, LITTLE GIRL...

TENDER AND FRESH, NOT ONE LUMP.
HELLO, LITTLE GIRL...

THIS ONEâ€™S ESPECIALLY LUSH,

DELICIOUS...

HELLO, LITTLE GIRL,

WHATâ€™S YOUR RUSH?
YOUâ€™RE MISSING ALL THE
FLOWERS.

THE SUN WONâ€™T SET FOR
HOURS,

TAKE YOUR TIME.
MOTHER SAID, â€STRAIGHT AHEAD,â€ NOT
TO DELAY

OR BE MISLED.
BUT SLOW, LITTLE GIRL,

HARK! AND HUSH-
THE BIRDS ARE SINGING SWEETLY.

YOUâ€™LL MISS THE BIRDS COMPLETELY,

YOUâ€™RE TRAVELLING SO FLEETLY.

GRANDMOTHER FIRST, THEN MISS PLUMP...
WHAT A DELECTABLE COUPLE.

UTTER PERFECTION: ONE BRITTLE, ONE
SUPPLE... ONE MOMENT, MY DEAR...
MOTHER SAID, â€COME WHAT MAY,

FOLLOW
THE PATH AND NEVER STRAY.â€

JUST SO, LITTLE GIRL... ANY PATH.
SO MANY WORTH EXPLORING.

JUST ONE
WOULD BE SO BORING.

AND LOOK WHAT
YOUâ€™RE IGNORING...

THINK OF THOSE CRISP, AGING BONES,
THEN SOMETHING FRESH ON THE PALATE.

THINK OF THAT SCRUMPTIOUS CARNALITY/
TWICE IN ONE DAY...

THEREâ€™S NO
POSSIBLE WAY

TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU
FEEL

WHEN YOUâ€™RE TALKING TO YOUR
MEAL!

For Granny.

MOTHER SAID NOT TO STRAY. STILL, I
SUPPOSE, A SMALL DELAY...

GRANNY MIGHT LIKE A FRESH BOUQUET...

Goodbye, Mr. Wolf.
Goodbye, little girl.

AND HELLO...

Why are you waiting for?! Go get the cape!
You frightened me!

Get it! Get it! Get it!

How am I supposed to get it?
You go up to the...

-little thing, and you
take it.
-I canâ€™t just take a cloak from a

little girl. Why donâ€™t you take it!

Itâ€™s the rules. Why do you think I
asked you in the first place?

Iâ€™m not allowed to touch
any of the objects!

Get me what I need!

Get me what I need!

Hello there little girl.

-Hello, Mr. Baker.
-Have you saved some of those sweets
for Granny?

I ate all the sweets and half the loaf
of bread.

So I see! Now tell me... where did you
get that beautiful cape?

My Granny made it for me.
Is that right?

-I would love a red cape
like that.
-Youâ€™d look pretty foolish.

May I take a look at it?

No!
I need it badly.

Please... give it back!

Aaa.

Iâ€™m sorry. I just wanted to make sure
that you really loved this cape.

Now off you go to Grannyâ€™s... and be
careful that no wolf comes your way.

I would rather a wolf than you any
day.

This is hopeless.

Iâ€™ll never get that red cape or find
a yellow slipper or a golden cow

...or was it a golden
slipper and a yellow cow?

What are you doing here?
You forgot your scarf.

You shouldnâ€™t be here. Itâ€™s not safe
in these woods!

I want to help.
No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE...

OUR HOUSE... WE MUST LIFT THE SPELL TOGETHER!
THE SPELL IS ON... ONLY

I CAN LIFT THE SPELL, THE SPELL IS
ON MY HOUSE...! THE SPELL IS ON...

A cow as white as...
...milk.

Go.

Hello there, young lad.

Hello, sir.
What might you be doing with a cow in the middle of the forest?

I was heading toward market...

but I seem to have lost my way.
What are you planning to do there?

And what are you planning to do there?
Sell my cow, sir.

No less than five pounds.
Five pounds!

Where are we to get five pounds?

She must be generous of milk to fetch
five pounds?

Yes, maâ€™am.

And if you canâ€™t fetch that sum? Then
what are you to do?

I hadnâ€™t thought of that...

This is all we have...

Beans? We mustnâ€™t give up our beans!

Well, if you feel we must...

Beans in exchange for my cow?
Oh son, these are no ordinary beans.

These beans carry... magic.

Magic? What kind of magic?

Tell him!

It's a... it's a magic that
defies description.

How many beans?

Six.
Five

Theyâ€™re worth a pound each, at least.

Could I buy my cow back someday?
Well ...Yes...

...possibly. Here.

Yes, this things probably
made a fair trade.

1 2 3 4 5

Allright bro.
Good luck in there,
Pleasure doing buisness with you.

One day, Iâ€™ll buy you back.

Promise!

Take the cow and go home!

I was just trying to help.
Magic beans!

Weâ€™ve no reason to believe
theyâ€™re magic! Are

we going to dispel this
curse through deceit?

No one would have given him
more for this creature.

We did him a favor. At least
theyâ€™ll have some food.

Five beans?!
Do we want a child or not?

Of course. I do. But... We have one chance.

Donâ€™t you see that? And if we fail...

Iâ€™m just not sure Iâ€™m cut out to be a
father.

Why do you say that?
Because of my father.

Youâ€™re not him.
I donâ€™t know...

If you canâ€™t do this for yourself,

canâ€™t you at least do it for me?

OK. You take the cow and go
home.

Iâ€™ll find the rest of the
things. On my own.

Rapunzel. Rapunzel.

Let down your hair to me.

Râ€™S PRINCE: Rapunzel...

The old enchantress had given
the name Rapunzel to the child

she had hidden away and
locked in a a doorless tower.

But little did she know that
the girlâ€™s lilting voice

had caught the attention
of a handsome Prince.â€

Rapunzel...

Donâ€™t you look lovely today, my dear.
Thank you, Mother.

I brought your favorite.

Blackberries,

fresh from the garden.

As the little girl approached her
Grannyâ€™s oak tree,

she was surprised
to see the door standing open.

Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps
itâ€™s all the sweets.

Granny? WOLF (In a granny
voice): Come in, my deary.

My, Grandmother. Youâ€™re looking very
strange.

What big ears you have!

The better to hear you with, my dear.

And with a single bound, the wolf had
devoured the little girl.

Well, it was a full day of eating for both.

I canâ€™t believe I just did that.

Wait!

Arenâ€™t you going to help us skin that
beast?

No thanks!
GRANNY: What kind of hunter are you?

Iâ€™m a baker.
Wait a minute. I never thanked you.

You need to be more careful, young lady.
Iâ€™m sorry.

I should have known better.
MOTHER SAID,

â€STRAIGHT AHEAD,â€ NOT
TO DELAY

OR BE MISLED.

I SHOULD HAVE HEEDED HER ADVICE...

BUT HE SEEMED SO NICE.

AND HE SHOWED ME THINGS, MANY
BEAUTIFUL THINGS,

THAT I HADNâ€™T
THOUGHT TO EXPLORE.

THEY WERE OFF MY
PATH, SO I NEVER HAD DARED.

I HAD BEEN SO CAREFUL
I NEVER HAD CARED.

AND HE MADE ME FEEL EXCITED... WELL,
EXCITED AND SCARED.

WHEN HE SAID â€œCOME IN!â€/
WITH THAT SICKENING GRIN,

HOW COULD I KNOW
WHAT WAS IN STORE?

ONCE HIS TEETH WERE
BARED, / THOUGH, I REALLY GOT SCARED... /

WELL, EXCITED AND SCARED.

BUT HE DREW ME CLOSE AND HE SWALLOWED
ME DOWN,

DOWN A DARK, SLIMY PATH/
WHERE LIE SECRETS THAT I NEVER WANT TO
KNOW,

AND WHEN EVERYTHING FAMILIAR SEEMED
TO DISAPPEAR FOREVER,

AT THE END OF
THE PATH WAS GRANNY ONCE AGAIN.

SO WE LAY IN THE DARK TILL YOU CAME
AND SET US FREE,

AND YOU BROUGHT US TO THE LIGHT,
AND WEâ€™RE

BACK AT THE START.

AND I KNOW THINGS NOW, MANY VALUABLE
THINGS,

THAT I HADNâ€™T KNOWN BEFORE:

DO NOT PUT YOUR FAITH IN A CAPE AND A
HOOD,

THEY WILL NOT PROTECT YOU THE WAY
THAT THEY SHOULD.

AND TAKE EXTRA CARE
WITH STRANGERS... EVEN FLOWERS HAVE
THEIR DANGERS.

AND THOUGH SCARY IS
EXCITING,

NICE IS DIFFERENT THAN
GOOD.

Mr. Baker. You saved our lives.

-Here.

Are you certain?
Yes. Maybe Granny will make me another with the skins of the wolf.

Thank You

Thank You
Yuck!

NOW, I KNOW: DONâ€™T BE SCARED. GRANNY
IS RIGHT, JUST BE PREPARED.

ISNâ€™T IT NICE TO KNOW A LOT?

AND A LITTLE BIT NOT...

How could you do this?

What sort of
boy would exchange a cow for beans?

But theyâ€™re magic... the man said...

Get your head out of the clouds!
Mother... no!

You and your worthless adventures!
Will you never learn, Jack?!

To bed without supper for you!

Pills!!

The first night of the festival ball
brought Cinderella her wish.

The Prince danced only with her, â€˜til he
turned and she had slipped away.

I must find that girl!

Are you alright, miss?
Yes

I just need to catch my breath.
What a beautiful gown youâ€™re wearing.

Were you at the Kingâ€™s Festival?

Yes.

Arenâ€™t you the lucky one.
Why ever are you in the woods at this hour?

STEWARD: This way!

Please. Donâ€™t let them know Iâ€™m here.

OMG! Have you seen a beautiful
young woman in a ball gown pass through?

I donâ€™t think so, sir.
If I may, my lord, I think I see her over there.

Iâ€™ve never lied to royalty before.

Iâ€™ve never anything to royalty before!
Thank you.

If a prince were looking for me, I
certainly wouldnâ€™t hide.

Well, what brings you
here... and with a cow?

Oh, my husbandâ€™s somewhere in the woods.
Heâ€™s undoing a spell. - Oh!

Oh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what
was he like?

HEâ€™S A VERY NICE PRINCE.
And?

AND...

ITâ€™S A VERY NICE BALL.

And?
AND... WHEN I ENTERED, THEY TRUMPETED.

And? THE PRINCE...?

OH, THE PRINCE...
YES, THE PRINCE!

WELL, HEâ€™S TALL.
IS THAT ALL?

DID YOU DANCE? IS HE CHARMING?
THEY SAY THAT HEâ€™S CHARMING.

WE DID NOTHING BUT DANCE.
Yes.

And?
AND IT MADE A NICE CHANGE.

NO, THE PRINCE!
OH, THE PRINCE...
YES, THE PRINCE.

HE HAS CHARM FOR A PRINCE, I GUESS...
GUESS?

I DONâ€™T MEET A WIDE RANGE.

AND ITâ€™S ALL VERY STRANGE.

But why would you run away?

Itâ€™s not quite what I expected.
Princes, castles, gowns...

I have no experience with those things.
But you will return to the Festival tomorrow eve?

Yes.
No...

I donâ€™t know...
You donâ€™t know?

What I wouldnâ€™t give to be in your shoes.
I mean your slippers.

As pure as gold?
I must get home.

No, Wait! I need your shoes!

Milky-White!

One midnight gone!

Already?!
Get that cow!

Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker!
Good fortune! Good fortune, sir!

Look what I have! Five gold pieces.

How would you come by five gold pieces?!

THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE SKY!

THERE ARE BIG TALL
TERRIBLE GIANTS IN THE SKY!

WHEN YOUâ€™RE WAY UP HIGH
AND YOU LOOK BELOW AT THE

WORLD YOUâ€™VE LEFT AND
THE THINGS YOU KNOW,

LITTLE MORE THAN A GLANCE IS ENOUGH
TO SHOW YOU JUST

HOW SMALL YOU ARE.

WHEN YOUâ€™RE WAY UP HIGH AND
YOUâ€™RE ON YOUR OWN IN A

WORLD LIKE NONE THAT YOUâ€™VE
EVER KNOWN, WHERE THE SKY

IS LEAD AND THE EARTH IS STONE,
YOUâ€™RE FREE TO DO WHATEVER PLEASES YOU,

EXPLORING THINGS YOUâ€™D NEVER DARE â€™CAUSE
YOU DONâ€™T CARE, WHEN SUDDENLY THEREâ€™S A BIG

TALL TERRIBLE GIANT AT THE DOOR.

A giant?

A BIG TALL TERRIBLE LADY GIANT

SWEEPING THE FLOOR

AND SHE GIVES YOU
FOOD AND SHE GIVES YOU REST

AND SHE DRAWS YOU
CLOSE TO HER GIANT BREAST

AND YOU KNOW THINGS NOW THAT YOU NEVER
KNEW BEFORE

NOT TILL THE SKY.

ONLY JUST WHEN YOUâ€™VE
MADE A FRIEND AND ALL,

AND YOU KNOW SHEâ€™S BIG
BUT YOU DONâ€™T FEEL SMALL

SOMEONE BIGGER THAN HER
COMES ALONG THE HALL

TO
SWALLOW YOU FOR LUNCH.

AND YOUR HEART IS LEAD AND YOUR STOMACH STONE
AND YOUâ€™RE REALLY SCARED BEING ALL ALONE,

AND ITâ€™S THEN THAT YOU MISS ALL
THE THINGS YOUâ€™VE KNOWN AND THE

WORLD YOUâ€™VE LEFT AND THE LITTLE YOU OWN.
THE FUN IS DONE.

YOU STEAL WHAT YOU
CAN AND RUN!

AND YOU SCRAMBLE DOWN AND YOU LOOK BELOW,
AND THE WORLD YOU KNOW BEGINS TO GROW:

THE HOUSE,
AND YOUR MOTHER AT THE DOOR.

THE ROOF, THE HOUSE, AND THE WORLD
YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO EXPLORE.

AND YOU THINK OF ALL OF
THE THINGS YOUâ€™VE SEEN.

AND YOU WISH THAT YOU
COULD LIVE IN BETWEEN,

AND YOUâ€™RE BACK AGAIN,
ONLY DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE,

AFTER THE SKY.

THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE SKY!

THERE ARE BIG TALL
TERRIBLE AWESOME SCARY

WONDERFUL GIANTS IN THE SKY!

So, hereâ€™s your money, sir!
Five gold pieces.

Where is my Milky-White?

Milky-White is back home with my wife.

Letâ€™s go find them! -Wait a minute!
Iâ€™m not sure I want to sell.

But you said I could buy her back.

Do you want more money?

No, no, no! Itâ€™s not that...
You keep that. Iâ€™ll fetch some more.

Wait. I didnâ€™t say...

Wait!

Wait! Wait!

Wait! I said wait!

What are you doing here?
Well...

I see youâ€™ve got the red cape!
Yes. Iâ€™ve got the cape. Only two items left.

Three.
Weâ€™ve the cape and the cow.

Youâ€™ve got the cape...
What have you done with the cow?!

She ran away.
What!

I never reached home. Iâ€™ve been looking for her all night.
How could you?

She might just as easily have run from you!

BUT SHE DIDNâ€™T!!! -BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE!
But she didnâ€™t!

BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE!
BUT SHE DIDNâ€™T!!!

WHO CARES! THE COW IS GONE! GET IT BACK!

GET IT BACK!!!
We were just going to do that. Here.

In the meantime...
STAY AWAY FROM ME WITH THAT, FOOL!!

I canâ€™t touch it!

By midnight tomorrow
bring me the items

or that child you wish for will
never see the light of day!

I donâ€™t like that woman.

Iâ€™m sorry I lost the cow.
I shouldnâ€™t have yelled.

Will you go back to the village?
I will make things right.

And then we can just go
about our life. No more witches

or dimwitted boys
or hungry little girls.

You GO!, please...

Go.

Good brother. I was wondering where
youâ€™d gone.

I have been looking all night for her.
Her?

The beautiful one I danced the evening with.
Where did she go?

Disappeared...

...like the fine morning mist.
She was lovely?

The loveliest. I am not certain of that!

I must confess, I too have found a lovely maiden.
She lives here in the woods.

She lives here in the woods.
In the woods?

Yes.

In the top of a tall tower
that has no door or stairs.

Where? -Two leagues from here, due
east, just beyond the mossy knoll

near the rose thickets.
And how do you manage a visit?

I stand beneath her tower and say,
â€œRapunzel,

Rapunzel, let down your hair to me.â€
And then she lowers the longest,

most beautiful head of hair -
yellow as corn - which I climb.

Rapunzel, Rapunzel!

What kind of name is that?
You jest!

I have never heard
of such a thing.

I speak the truth! She is
as true as your maiden. A maiden

running from a prince?
None would run from us.

Yet one has.

DID I ABUSE HER OR
SHOW HER DISDAIN?

WHY DOES SHE RUN FROM ME?

IF I SHOULD LOSE HER, HOW SHALL I
REGAIN THE HEART SHE HAS WON FROM ME?

AGONY...! BEYOND POWER OF SPEECH.

WHEN THE ONE THING YOU WANT IS
THE ONLY THING OUT OF YOUR REACH.

HIGH IN HER TOWER, SHE SITS BY
THE HOUR, MAINTAINING HER HAIR.

BLITHE AND BECOMING, AND FREQUENTLY HUMMING
A LIGHTHEARTED AIR: â€œAH-AH-AH-AH-AHAHAH... â€

AGONY...! FAR MORE
PAINFUL THAN YOURS,

WHEN YOU KNOW SHE WOULD GO WITH
YOU, IF THERE ONLY WERE DOORS.

AGONY! OH THE TORTURE THEY TEACH!

WHATâ€™S AS INTRIGUING... OR HALF SO
FATIGUING... AS WHATâ€™S OUT OF REACH?

AM I NOT SENSITIVE, CLEVER,
WELLMANNERED, CONSIDERATE, PASSIONATE,

CHARMING, AS KIND AS Iâ€™M
HANDSOME, AND HEIR TO A THRONE?

YOU ARE EVERYTHING
MAIDENS COULD WISH FOR!

THEN WHY NO...?
DO I KNOW?

THE GIRL MUST BE MAD.

YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MADNESS

TILL YOUâ€™RE CLIMBING HER HAIR AND YOU
SEE HER UP THERE AS YOUâ€™RE NEARING HER,

ALL THE WHILE HEARING HER,
â€œAH-AH-AHAH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH... â€

AGONY! MISERY! WOE! THOUGH ITâ€™S
DIFFERENT FOR EACH. ALWAYS

TEN STEPS BEHIND... ALWAYS

TEN FEET BELOW... AND SHEâ€™S

JUST OUT OF REACH

AGONY!

THAT CAN CUT LIKE A KNIFE!

I MUST HAVE HER TO WIFE.

Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let
your hair down to me.

Is that you at this hour, my Prince?

Yes.

Excuse me for this.

As the Bakerâ€™s Wife
bolted from the tower,

the second night of the
festival was thrown into chaos

when Cinderella once again
ran from the Prince.

What are you doing?
So sorry I need your shoes.

Over here!

Who is she? Where did she go?
I have no idea, sir.

Donâ€™t play the fool, woman!
I was trying to hold her here for you...

I can capture my own damsel, thank you.

No sign of her, my liege. Well, what are you waiting for?
See if you can find her. -Go!

The woods can be a dangerous place...

Moo... Moo......

Please, if you would be so kind, may I
compare this ear of corn with your hair?

Mongrel!

Milky-White!

I thought you were returning home!
Oh! Itâ€™s you! And youâ€™ve the cow!

Yes. I got the cow. Weâ€™ve two of the four.
Three -Two -Three

Compare this to your corn.

Where did you find it?
I pulled it from a maiden in a tower.

Three!
And Had I

almost go the fourth, but she got away.

Weâ€™ve one entire day left. Surely
we can locate the slipper by then. -We?

You mean youâ€™re going to let me
stay with you?

Well... perhaps it will take the two of
us to have this child.

YOUâ€™VE CHANGED. YOUâ€™RE DARING.
YOUâ€™RE DIFFERENT IN THE WOODS.

MORE SURE, MORE SHARING. YOUâ€™RE
GETTING US THROUGH THE WOODS.

IF YOU COULD SEE... YOUâ€™RE NOT THE MAN
WHO STARTED, AND MUCH MORE

OPENHEARTED THEN I
KNEW YOU TO BE.

IT TAKES TWO. I THOUGHT ONE

WAS ENOUGH, ITâ€™S NOT TRUE:

IT TAKES TWO OF US
YOU CAME THROUGH

WHEN THE JOURNEY WAS
ROUGH... IT TOOK YOU

IT TOOK TWO OF US.
IT TAKES CARE,

IT TAKES PATIENCE AND FEAR
AND DESPAIR

TO CHANGE THOUGH YOU SWEAR TO CHANGE,
WHO CAN TELL IF YOU DO?

IT TAKES TWO.
YOUâ€™VE CHANGED.

YOUâ€™RE THRIVING.
THEREâ€™S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WOODS.

NOT JUST SURVIVING, YOUâ€™RE
BLOSSOMING IN THE WOODS.

AT HOME Iâ€™D FEAR WEâ€™D
STAY THE SAME FOREVER.

AND THEN OUT HERE

YOUâ€™RE PASSIONATE, CHARMING,
CONSIDERATE, CLEVER... IT TAKES ONE

TO BEGIN, BUT THEN ONCE
YOUâ€™VE BEGUN,

IT TAKES TWO OF YOU. ITâ€™S NO FUN,

BUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE YOU
CAN DO

WHEN THEREâ€™S TWO OF YOU.
IF I DARE,

ITâ€™S BECAUSE Iâ€™M BECOMING
AWARE OF US

AS A PAIR OF US EACH ACCEPTING
A SHARE OF WHATâ€™S THERE.

WEâ€™VE CHANGED. WEâ€™RE STRANGERS.

Iâ€™M MEETING YOU IN THE WOODS.
WHO MINDS WHAT DANGERS?

I KNOW WEâ€™LL GET PAST THE WOODS.

AND ONCE WEâ€™RE PAST, LETâ€™S HOPE THE
CHANGES LAST

BEYOND WOODS, BEYOND
WITCHES AND SLIPPERS AND HOODS

JUST THE TWO OF US BEYOND LIES,

SAFE AT HOME
WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL PRIZE,

JUST THE FEW OF US.
IT TAKES TRUST.

IT TAKES JUST A BIT
MORE AND WEâ€™RE DONE

WE WANT FOUR, WE HAD NONE. WEâ€™VE GOT THREE.

WE NEED ONE. IT TAKES TWO.

Stop it! Stop my egg!

Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White.

I missed you so much!
Where did you get this?

From the Giantâ€™s hen! -A golden egg!
Iâ€™ve never seen a golden egg before.

And you can have it. Along
with the five gold pieces.

Five gold pieces?
Now Iâ€™m taking my cow.

O..no, I didn't wish to sell.
But you took the five gold pieces.

I didnâ€™t take, you gave.
You said I could have my cow!

Now I never said you could. I
said you might.

You would take money before a child?!
No, no, no - itâ€™s not like that!

Itâ€™s not how it sounds!

Milky-White...!

Milky-White is dead!

TWO MIDNIGHTS GONE!

When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but
one day left to reverse the Witchâ€™s curse.

As for Rapunzelâ€™s Prince, he returned

yet again to the
forbidden tower.

Bad idea!

Are you allright?

Yah, Yah, me allright.

WHAT DID I CLEARLY SAY? CHILDREN MUST LISTEN.
No, no, please!

WHAT WERE YOU NOT TO DO?
CHILDREN MUST SEE... -No!

AND LEARN.

WHY COULD YOU NOT OBEY?

CHILDREN SHOULD LISTEN.

WHAT HAVE I BEEN TO YOU? WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME BE, HANDSOME LIKE A PRINCE?

AH, BUT I AM OLD. I AM UGLY.
I EMBARRASS YOU. -No!

YOU ARE ASHAMED OF ME.
No!

YOU ARE ASHAMED.

YOU DONâ€™T
UNDERSTAND.

Iâ€™m no longer a child. I
wish to see the world.

DONâ€™T YOU KNOW WHATâ€™S
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD?

SOMEONE HAS TO SHIELD YOU FROM
THE WORLD

STAY WITH ME.

PRINCES WAIT THERE IN THE WORLD, ITâ€™S
TRUE.

PRINCES, YES, BUT
WOLVES AND HUMANS, TOO.

STAY AT HOME.

I AM HOME.

WHO OUT THERE COULD LOVE YOU MORE THAN I?
WHAT OUT THERE

THAT I
CANNOT SUPPLY?

STAY WITH ME.

STAY WITH ME, THE WORLD IS DARK AND
WILD

STAY A CHILD WHILE YOU CAN BE A
CHILD.

WITH ME.

I gave you protection and
yet you disobeyed me.

No!

Your prince will never lay eyes on you
again.

He will never lay eyes
on anything again!

What did you do to him?

It doesnâ€™t matter...

because where youâ€™re
going, no one will ever see you again.

No, No!

No!

Hey there, nice cape! -Stay away from my
cape or Iâ€™ll slash you into a thousand bits!

Whoa! I donâ€™t want it.

-Where did you get it?
-My Granny made it for me from a wolf
that attacked us.

And she gave me this beautiful knife for protection.
Well, look what I have! A golden egg.

Where did you get that egg?
I stole a hen that

lays golden eggs from the
kingdom of the Giant.

I donâ€™t believe you.

Itâ€™s true. And you should see
the Giantâ€™s toy harp. It plays

the most beautiful tunes without
your even having to touch it.

Of course it does. Why
donâ€™t you go up to the

kingdom right now and bring
it back and show it?

I could.

You could not! -I could!
You could not, Mr. Liar!

I am not a liar! Iâ€™ll get that harp.
Youâ€™ll see!

Jack took the little girlâ€™s dare and before he
knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant.

Weâ€™ve only one day left! I
donâ€™t know where to start.

You can start by buying a
new cow with the money you

took from the boy. -Right,
where do I buy a cow?

You go to the next village,
youâ€™ll find a cow there.

What are you going to do?
Iâ€™m going to get the slipper.

The yellow slipper?
The GOLDEN slipper!

Yes. The golden slipper, thatâ€™s what I
meant. How are you gon'na find it?

I have met a maiden with golden
slippers these two previous nights.

You think you could get one? -Yes, Iâ€™m sure of it.
Iâ€™ll meet you back here.

Right.
Why are we always separating?

Because we have to if weâ€™re going to
be together...

What is happening?

Ã‡Ã¡Ã£Ã£Ã¡ÃŸÃ‰ ÃˆÃŸÃ‡Ã£Ã¡Ã¥Ã‡
Ã•ÃšÃžÃŠ ÃšÃ¤ÃÃ£Ã‡ ÃƒÃ¤Ã¥Ã‡Ã‘ÃŠ Ã‡Ã¡Ã”ÃŒÃ‘Ã‰ Ã‡Ã¡ÃšÃ£Ã¡Ã‡ÃžÃ‰

The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk
came crashing down, killing the Giant...

...as for Cinderella, she fled from
the Prince... again.

HEâ€™S A VERY SMART PRINCE

HEâ€™S A PRINCE WHO PREPARES.

KNOWING THIS TIME
Iâ€™D RUN FROM HIM,

HE SPREAD
PITCH ON THE STAIRS.

AND Iâ€™M CAUGHT UNAWARES.

WELL, IT MEANS THAT HE CARES...

THIS IS MORE THAN JUST MALICE.

BETTER STOP AND TAKE STOCK WHILE YOUâ€™RE STANDING
HERE STUCK/ ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE.

ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

WHY NOT STAY AND BE CAUGHT? SHOULD I GIVE
THAT A THOUGHT, WHAT WOULD BE HIS RESPONSE?

BUT THEN WHAT IF HE KNEW WHO I AM WHEN I KNOW
THAT Iâ€™M NOT WHAT HE THINKS THAT HE WANTS?

OR THEN WHAT IF I AM WHAT
A PRINCE WOULD ENVISION?

BUT THEN HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE TILL
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, WHICH I DONâ€™T?

SO THEN WHICH DO YOU PICK:
WHERE YOUâ€™RE SAFE, OUT OF

SIGHT, AND YOURSELF, BUT
WHERE EVERYTHINGâ€™S WRONG?

OR WHERE EVERYTHINGâ€™S RIGHT BUT YOU
KNOW THAT YOUâ€™LL NEVER BELONG?

AND WHICHEVER YOU PICK, DO
IT QUICK, â€˜CAUSE YOUâ€™RE

STARTING TO STICK TO THE
STEPS OF THE PALACE.

ITâ€™S MY FIRST BIG DECISION, THE
CHOICE ISNâ€™T EASY TO MAKE.

TO ARRIVE AT A BALL IS EXCITING AND ALL...
ONCE YOUâ€™RE THERE, THOUGH, ITâ€™S SCARY.

AND ITâ€™S FUN TO DECEIVE WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU CAN LEAVE, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WARY.

THEREâ€™S A LOT THATâ€™S AT STAKE,
BUT Iâ€™VE STALLED LONG ENOUGH

â€˜CAUSE Iâ€™M STILL STANDING STUCK
IN THE STUFF ON THESE STEPS

...BETTER RUN ALONG HOME AND AVOID THE COLLISION THOUGH
AT HOME THEY DONâ€™T CARE, Iâ€™LL BE BETTER OFF THERE

WHERE
THEREâ€™S NOTHING TO CHOOSE, SO THEREâ€™S
NOTHING TO LOSE.

SO Iâ€™LL PRY UP MY SHOES.

WAIT, THOUGH, THINKING IT THROUGH,
THINGS DONâ€™T HAVE TO COLLIDE...

I KNOW WHAT MY DECISION IS:
WHICH IS NOT TO DECIDE.

Iâ€™LL JUST LEAVE HIM A CLUE:
FOR EXAMPLE, A SHOE.

AND THEN SEE WHAT HEâ€™LL DO. NOW ITâ€™S HE
AND NOT YOU WHOâ€™LL BE STUCK WITH A SHOE

IN A STEW, IN THE
GOO, AND Iâ€™VE LEARNED SOMETHING

TOO, SOMETHING I NEVER KNEW,

ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE!

The ball is over.
Send everyone home.

And the Princess?
She wonâ€™t get far with one shoe.

Donâ€™t come any closer to me.
Please, stop! Just hear me out!

You have attacked me once before.
I didnâ€™t attack you.

I attacked your shoe. I need it. I

have a magic bean
in exchange for it.

Magic bean?

Nonsense!
Wait, please. I havenâ€™t much time!

I need that shoe
to have a child.

That makes no sense! -Does it make sense
that youâ€™re running from a prince?

I must go!
Take my shoes. Youâ€™ll run faster.

ÃŽÃÃ­ Ã”ÃŸÃ‘Ã‡ Ã¡ÃŸ

Stop! What is that you
have in your hand?

Itâ€™s mine. -Lying will
cost you your life!

I donâ€™t care if this
costs me my life... Get away!

You will pay for this!

Sire! I have succeeded in
obtaining the other slipper.

Please give me the slipper, kind Prince,
and all will come to a happy end.

Step back, peon!

Do as she says, Steward.
We only need one.

We must search immediately for the
maiden who fits this slipper.

Tonight?
This very night!

And in her haste, the Bakerâ€™s Wife took no
notice of a second beanstalk climbing skyward.

Let it be known that his Royal
Highness the Crown Prince

will be visiting every house
in this village tonight.

All young maidens are hereby
commanded to remain in

their home until they are
visited by the Royal Guard.

All young maidens are hereby...

As the Prince anxiously
waited, the Stepmother took

matters... and Florindaâ€™s
foot... into her own hands.

CAREFUL, MY TOE...!
DARLING, I KNOW...

ITâ€™LL HAVE TO GO. BUT WHEN
YOUâ€™RE HIS BRIDE, YOU

CAN SIT OR RIDE. YOUâ€™LL
NEVER NEED TO WALK!

Aaaaaaaaa!

Minus one toe, Florinda
mounted the Princeâ€™s horse,

unaware of the blood
dripping from the slipper.

Lucinda was next.

WHY WONâ€™T IT FIT? DARLING, BE STILL. CUT
OFF A BIT OF THE HEEL AND IT WILL. AND

WHEN YOUâ€™RE HIS WIFE YOUâ€™LL HAVE SUCH
A LIFE,

YOUâ€™LL NEVER NEED TO WALK!

Aaaaaa...!

Minus a heel, Lucinda did her
best to swallow the pain.

Itâ€™s a perfect fit, Your Highness!

Have you no other daughters? Only a
little stunted kitchen wench, which her

late father left behind but she cannot
present herself. She is too dirty.

I would recognize these beautiful eyes anywhere.
This is the true bride!

You are my true bride!

As punishment for their
cruelty, Cinderellaâ€™s birds

swooped down upon the Stepsisters...

and blinded them.

ÃˆÃ‡Ã¡Ã¤Ã“ÃˆÃ‰ Ã¡Ã‘Ã­ÃˆÃ‡Ã¤Ã’Ã¡

As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to
a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest.

Subtitled by-Mamun Mehedee

Rapunzel?

Rapunzel?

Rapunzel?

My darling!
I'm here.

Rapunzel?

Rapunzel?

Rapunzel? Is it you?
I'm blind, I can't see.

How could she do this to you?

Rapunzel!
What?

I can see you!

You are here.

Come on!

We donâ€™t have any time...

Come on!

Iâ€™ve found you!
Youâ€™ve got the cow!

Youâ€™ve got the slipper!
Weâ€™ve all four!

I see a cow. I see a slipper.

And the cape as red as blood.

And the hair as yellow as corn.
We got all full.

Wait a minute! That cow doesnâ€™t
look as white as milk to me

Of course she is.

She has to be!

This cow has been covered with flour!

What? You didnâ€™t get a real white cow.

We had a cow as white as milk.
Honestly we did.

Then where is she?
Sheâ€™s dead.

And we thought youâ€™d
prefer a live cow.

Of course Iâ€™d prefer a live cow! So show me
the dead cow and Iâ€™ll bring her back to life!

OK. This way, this way.

Jack!

Jack!

Jack!

There you are! Iâ€™ve been
worried sick about you!

Thereâ€™s a dead giant in our backyard!

-There is? -You know there is.

You could have been crushed!
But Mother, look.

The most beautiful harp.

Youâ€™ve stolen too much.

You could have been killed coming down
that plant

Weâ€™re running out of time!
Itâ€™s here...

Whatâ€™s happening?- -Sheâ€™s going
to bring Milky-White back to life.

She can do that?
Sheâ€™s a witch! She can do anything!

Wow!
Stand back!

Milky-White. Youâ€™re back!
I can't believe it!

Itâ€™s almost midnight!

Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow.

What?
You heard me!

Feed them to the cow

Really!

Fill with the milk. Iâ€™ll do it.
Sheâ€™ll only milk for me. -Good boy

Squeeze, pal! You can do it.

Not working!

Wrong ingredients.

Forget about a child!

No, no, no...

Wait! We followed your instructions.
One, the cow is as white as milk. Correct?

Yes.

And two, the cape was certainly as red
as blood. -Yes

And three, the slipper... -Yes And four, I
compared the hair with this ear of corn. -Yes

I pulled it from a
maiden in a tower and...

You what?!

What were you doing there? Well, nothing.
I happened to be passing by...

I touched that hair! I told you! I
cannot have touched the ingredients!

Nooooo... The corn! The corn! You can
use the silky hair of the corn...

Yes! Yes!

Pull it from the ear and feed it
to the cow. Quickly!

Itâ€™s working!
Sheâ€™s milking!

At last!

And it came to pass, all that seemed
wrong was now right.

The Witch succeeded in
reversing her motherâ€™s curse.

Cinderella finally stopped
running from her Prince.

Jack was reunited with his beloved cow

and his mother could now dress in
the best a golden egg could buy.

And the Baker and his Wife were proud
parents of a strapping baby boy.

Thanks for the slipper.

Attention! Let us cheer the newlyweds as they
embark on their happy bliss today, and ever after...

And so with the kingdom
filled with joy, those who

deserved to were destined
to live happily ever...

Jack? Jack...?

Attention! Attention!

Let there be no
panic. NO PANIC!

The Royal Prince wishes to
address his loyal subjects.

Attention!

Thereâ€™s no need for worry. It was an earthquake
in a far-off quadrant of our kingdom.

Nothing to fear at all.

I would personally
investigate the disturbance.

Now everyone, back to your
villages, and on with

your lives!

But as they made their way back into
the woods,

their familiar paths
were nowhere to be found

and their lives were about
to take an unexpected turn.

Everythingâ€™s so different.

Hello, little one.

Hello, Mr. BAKER.
You alright?

What are you doing here? With a
suitcase?

Iâ€™m moving in with Granny. Our whole village collapsed.
I couldnâ€™t find my mother anywhere.

And now I canâ€™t find
my Grannyâ€™s cottage.

What do you mean? -I went down the
dell, and I didnâ€™t recognize anything.

There was no path. Whereâ€™s she?
Whereâ€™s Granny?

Calm, calm. Ok. We can help you
find Grannyâ€™s without the path.

Please take him for a few moments.
Really!

Why does he always cry when I hold
him?

You neednâ€™t hold him as
if he was so fragile.

He doesnâ€™t want me. He wants his mother! I
canâ€™t take care of him all of the time.

Iâ€™ll take care of him... when heâ€™s
older...

Who might that be? Itâ€™s the
Steward and the royal family.

Hello, there!

What brings you into the woods?
The castle has been destroyed.

No! The kingdom is under attack.

What is the Royal family going to do?

I have no idea! I donâ€™t make policy.
I just carry it out.

I think it best we get back to the village.
Weâ€™ll take the girl with us.

You come with us.

Itâ€™s a giant!
A giant woman!

Where is the lad who
killed my husband?

There is no lad here!
We havenâ€™t seen him.

Weâ€™ll get him for you right away.
Donâ€™t move!

It was you who destroyed our
house - not an earthquake.

And who destroyed my house?
I want him!

Would you like a blind girl instead?

How dare you? She wants the boy!

Jack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He
ran off again and Iâ€™ve been...

Sheâ€™s looking for him too.

Give him to me!

Jack is just a lad! We had no food
to eat so he sold his beloved cow

in exchange for magic beans.

The boy - I want the boy!

You leave my boy alone!
Iâ€™m waiting!

Donâ€™t make her angry, woman, or youâ€™ll
get us all killed!

Flouncing through our kingdom with your great big
clodhopppers, destroying everything in your path.

You big bully! Iâ€™ll hide my son
and youâ€™ll never find him.

Youâ€™ll never, ever... Get back woman!

The boy is hiding in the steeple
tower. You can find him there.

Yes, thatâ€™s true.

Yes. The steeple tower.We saw him there!
If he is not,

I will return tonight and find you!

All of you!

Look! What have you done to her?

ÃƒÃ‡ÃÃ‡ ÃÃšÃ¡ÃŠ Ã¡Ã¥Ã‡Â¿

I didnâ€™t mean to hurt her. I was just
thinking of the greater good.

Listen everyone. If weâ€™re going to get
through this we have to stick together.

Some people are cut out to battle
giants, and others are not.

I donâ€™t have the constitution. And as long
as I can be of no help, Iâ€™m going to hide.

Letâ€™s go! Everything will
work out fine in the end.

Not always.

I donâ€™t know where they think theyâ€™re going.
The giantâ€™s already destroyed

the entire village.

Only thing left of my
garden are these beans.

What are we going to do now?
We have no choice.

Find the boy and give her what she wants.

But if we do, sheâ€™ll kill Jack. And if
we donâ€™t sheâ€™ll kill half the kingdom!

Promise me you wonâ€™t let them get Jack.
Promise!

Okay, I promise.

Rapunzel!

Youâ€™re safe!

Thank goodness.

Who are you?
Surely you remember?

Of course you donâ€™t recognize me, Mother!

This is who I truly am, my dear. Now you
donâ€™t have to be embarrassed by me.

You must come with me.
Thereâ€™s a Giant in the land.

My darling. Are you all right?
Why did you run off?

I was afraid.
Come with me.

Sheâ€™s not going with you!
You will come with me.

I will not come with you!

Then you leave me no choice.

No!

OMG!
You! The one who blinded me.

And locked me in a tower.
To protect you.

...and then banished me to an
island... in the middle of a swamp!

I was just trying to be a good mother!

Rapunzel, no!

You will never be safe with him.
Take me away from here.

Donâ€™t you understand? I never want to
see you again. Ever!

RAPUNZEL, the giant!

Jack!

Jack!
Jack!

Jack! where are you?

Jack!

Weâ€™re never going to find him. -We should fan out.
Itâ€™ll increase our chances.

No. You canâ€™t be on your own.
Iâ€™ll be all right.

What if we get lost? -Weâ€™ll
count our steps from right here.

Iâ€™ll go, too.
No.

You stay right here with the baby.

We'll be right back.

You would leave our son with her?
Yes. Heâ€™s asleep.

Heâ€™ll be safe with the girl. -I am
very capable of caring for the baby.

See? -But what if the
Giant comes back...

What if, what if! Five

Hello, Your Royal Highness.

Hello.

Hello again. We met before actually.

Yes, Of course.

You must be here to slay the Giant.

The Giant? Yes. Surely youâ€™ve heard
there is a giant in our...

midst. Not an earthquake...

Of course.

A giant.

Yes, itâ€™s a lady giant.
It's a very unusual, huh?

I should think. And why are
you alone in the woods?

-Well, I came with my husband.

We were... well you see...
itâ€™s a long story.

He would let you roam alone in the woods?
No, actually it was my choice.

How brave!
Brave

Yes.

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE WOODS

MAY I KISS YOU? ANY MOMENT
WE COULD BE CRUSHED -Uh...

DONâ€™T FEEL RUSHED.

THIS IS RIDICULOUS, WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
Iâ€™M IN THE WRONG STORY.

Wait one moment, please! We canâ€™t do this!
You have a Princess!

Well, yes, I do. -And
I have a... baker.

Of course,

youâ€™re right. How foolish.

FOOLISHNESS CAN HAPPEN IN THE WOODS

ONCE AGAIN, PLEASE... LET
YOUR HESITATIONS BE HUSHED.

ANY MOMENT, BIG OR SMALL, IS A MOMENT, AFTER ALL.
SEIZE THE MOMENT, SKIES MAY FALL ANY MOMENT.

But this is not right!

RIGHT AND WRONG DONâ€™T
MATTER IN THE WOODS

ONLY FEELINGS. LET US MEET
THE MOMENT UNBLUSHED

LIFE IS OFTEN
SO UNPLEASANT...

YOU MUST KNOW THAT, AS A PEASANT... BEST
TO TAKE THE MOMENT PRESENT

AS A PRESENT FOR THE
MOMENT.

77 78

479 480

481 482 Excuse me, maâ€™am.

Have you seen a boy...

He is about so high... -Iâ€™m
sorry, may I be of some service?

The tree has fallen.

Motherâ€™s grave, destroyed.

Oh. Iâ€™m sorry.

I shouldnâ€™t complain. Iâ€™m sure others
have suffered worse after the earthquake

Earthquake? Itâ€™s no earthquake... thereâ€™s
a giant terrorizing the kingdom!

Well, Iâ€™m sure the Prince will see to
it that the Giant is rid from our land.

Hah, the Prince? No doubt heâ€™s off
somewhere seducing some young maiden.

What?

You look just like the Princess... but
dirty.

Oh no, you are the Princess!
Iâ€™m sorry. I didnâ€™t recognize you.

No, no. Please... Get up! Iâ€™m not a
princess here.

I had to disguise myself. Iâ€™m not
permitted to leave the palace unescorted.

If youâ€™d like you can come with me.

You will be safe in our company.
Thank you.

-This way.

I must leave you. Now I
must go off to slay a giant.

I shall not forget you.

How brave you are to
be alone in the woods.

And how alive youâ€™ve
made me feel.

What was that?

WAS THAT ME? WAS THAT
HIM?

DID A PRINCE REALLY KISS ME AND KISS ME?
AND KISS ME?

AND DID I KISS HIM BACK?
WAS IT WRONG?

AM I MAD? IS THAT ALL? DOES HE MISS ME?
WAS HE SUDDENLY GETTING BORED WITH ME?

WAKE UP! STOP DREAMING

STOP PRANCING
ABOUT THE WOODS

ITâ€™S NOT BESEEMING. WHAT
IS IT ABOUT THE WOODS?

BACK TO LIFE, BACK TO
SENSE, BACK TO CHILD

BACK TO HUSBAND, NO ONE
LIVES IN THE WOODS.

THERE ARE VOWS, THERE ARE TIES, THERE
ARE NEEDS, THERE ARE STANDARDS

THERE ARE SHOULDNâ€™TS AND
SHOULDS.

WHY NOT BOTH INSTEAD? THEREâ€™S
THE ANSWER, IF YOUâ€™RE CLEVER:

HAVE A CHILD FOR WARMTH AND A BAKER FOR
BREAD, AND A PRINCE

FOR WHATEVER...

NEVER! ITâ€™S THESE WOODS.

FACE THE FACTS, FIND THE BOY

JOIN THE GROUP, STOP THE GIANT

JUST GET OUT OF THESE WOODS.

WAS THAT HIM? YES IT WAS.

WAS THAT ME? NO, IT WASNâ€™T

JUST A TRICK OF THE WOODS.

JUST A MOMENT, ONE
PECULIAR PASSING MOMENT...

MUST IT ALL BE EITHER LESS OR
MORE, EITHER PLAIN OR GRAND?

IS IT ALWAYS â€œORâ€?
IS IT NEVER â€œANDâ€?

THATâ€™S WHAT WOODS ARE FOR:

FOR THOSE MOMENTS IN THE WOODS.

OH, IF LIFE WERE MADE OF MOMENTS

EVEN NOW AND THEN A BAD ONE...!

BUT IF LIFE WERE ONLY MOMENTS.
THEN YOUâ€™D NEVER KNOW YOU HAD ONE

FIRST A WITCH, THEN A
CHILD, THEN A PRINCE

THEN A MOMENT... WHO CAN
LIVE IN THE WOODS?

AND TO GET WHAT YOU WISH,
ONLY JUST FOR A MOMENT...

THESE ARE DANGEROUS WOODS...

LET THE MOMENT GO. DONâ€™T FORGET
IT FOR A MOMENT, THOUGH.

JUST REMEMBERING YOUâ€™VE HAD AN
â€œAND,â€ WHEN YOUâ€™RE BACK TO â€œORâ€

MAKES THE â€œORâ€ MEAN
MORE THAN IT DID BEFORE

NOW I UNDERSTAND... AND ITâ€™S
TIME TO LEAVE THE WOODS!

72 73

She should be back by now.
She wouldnâ€™t get lost.

Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™ll return.

No, I must go and look for her...
Look who I found!

Youâ€™re hurting me!
Let go of him!

Iâ€™ll let go of him when I
give him to the Giant.

Make her stop!
Leave him alone!

Keep away from him.
Stop! I said stop!

Where did you find this?

Iâ€™m sorry, sir...
Itâ€™s my wifeâ€™s!

Iâ€™m sorry. I came upon her. She
was at the bottom of a cliff...

What are you saying?

How awful...
No. No...!

This is my fault.

I let her wander off alone.

I should have made her stay with me.
Remorse will get you nowhere.

My wife is dead! -Wake up!
When youâ€™re dead, youâ€™re dead.

Now itâ€™s time to get this boy to the Giant
before weâ€™re all... Keep away from him. -No!

This is no time to be soft-hearted! Heâ€™s
going to the Giant and Iâ€™m taking him.

Yes! Heâ€™s the one to blame!

Itâ€™s because of you thereâ€™s a giant
in our midst and my wife is dead!

BUT IT ISNâ€™T MY FAULT, I WAS
GIVEN THOSE BEANS! YOU PERSUADED

ME TO TRADE AWAY MY COW FOR
BEANS! AND WITHOUT THOSE BEANS

THEREâ€™D HAVE BEEN NO STALK TO GET UP
TO THE GIANTS IN THE FIRST PLACE!

WAIT A MINUTE... MAGIC BEANS FOR A COW
SO OLD THAT YOU HAD TO TELL A LIE

TO SELL IT, WHICH YOU TOLD!
WERE THEY WORTHLESS BEANS?

WERE THEY OVERSOLD?

OH, AND TELL US WHO PERSUADED
YOU TO STEAL THAT GOLD!

SEE, ITâ€™S YOUR FAULT.
No!

YES, IT IS!
It's no!

ITâ€™S TRUE.
WAIT A MINUTE,

THOUGH... I ONLY STOLE
THE GOLD TO GET MY COW BACK FROM YOU!

SO ITâ€™S YOUR FAULT!
YES! -NO, IT ISNâ€™T!

Iâ€™D HAVE KEPT THOSE BEANS,
BUT OUR HOUSE WAS CURSED.

SHE MADE US GET A COW TO
GET THE CURSE REVERSED!

ITâ€™S HIS FATHERâ€™S FAULT
THAT THE CURSE GOT PLACED

AND THE PLACE GOT CURSED
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

OH. THEN ITâ€™S HIS FAULT!
SO. -IT WAS HIS FAULT.

NO. -YES, IT IS, ITâ€™S HIS.

I GUESS...
WAIT A MINUTE

THOUGH... I CHOPPED DOWN THE BEANSTALK, RIGHT?
THATâ€™S CLEAR.

BUT WITHOUT ANY BEANSTALK,
THEN WHATâ€™S QUEER

IS HOW DID THE SECOND GIANT GET DOWN
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? SECOND PLACE...

YES!
HOW?

HMM... WELL, WHO HAD

THE OTHER BEAN? -THE OTHER BEAN? -THE OTHER BEAN?
YOU POCKETED THE OTHER BEAN.

I DIDNâ€™T! YES, I DID.

SO ITâ€™S YOUR FAULT...! NO, IT ISNâ€™T
â€˜CAUSE I GAVE IT TO MY WIFE!

SO ITâ€™S HER FAULT...!
NO, IT ISNâ€™T!

THEN WHOSE IS IT?
WAIT A MINUTE!

SHE EXCHANGED THAT BEAN
TO OBTAIN YOUR SHOE,

SO THE ONE WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE BEAN IS YOU! YOU MEAN THAT OLD

BEAN THAT YOUR WIFE...? OH, DEAR...
BUT I NEVER KNEW, AND SO I THREW...

WELL, DONâ€™T LOOK HERE!

SO ITâ€™S YOUR FAULT! -BUT...
SEE, ITâ€™S HER FAULT...! -BUT-

AND IT ISNâ€™T MINE AT ALL!
BUT WHAT?

WELL, IF YOU HADNâ€™T
GONE BACK UP AGAIN...

YOU WERE GREEDY! DID
YOU NEED THAT HEN?

BUT I GOT IT FOR MY MOTHER...!
SO ITâ€™S HER FAULT THEN!

YES, AND WHAT ABOUT THE HARP IN
THE THIRD PLACE? THE HARP... YES!

SHE WENT AND DARED ME TO! -I DARED YOU TO?
YOU DARED ME TO!

SHE SAID THAT I WAS SCARED... -ME?
... TO. SHE DARED ME!

NO, I DIDNâ€™T!
SO ITâ€™S YOUR FAULT! -WAIT A MINUTE...!

IF YOU HADNâ€™T DARED HIM TO... AND YOU HAD LEFT THE HARP ALONE,
WE WOULDNâ€™T BE IN TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE! WELL, IF YOU

HADNâ€™T THROWN -WELL, IF SHE HADNâ€™T RAISED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE...!
AWAY THE BEAN IN THE FIRST PLACE...! IT WAS YOUR FAULT!

ITâ€™S THE LAST MIDNIGHT.

ITâ€™S THE LAST WISH.
ITâ€™S THE LAST MIDNIGHT

SOON IT WILL BE BOOM... SQUISH!

TOLD A LITTLE LIE,
STOLE A LITTLE GOLD,

BROKE A LITTLE VOW, DID YOU?
HAD TO GET YOUR PRINCE

HAD TO GET YOUR COW

HAD TO GET YOUR WISH, DOESNâ€™T
MATTER HOW... ANYWAY

IT DOESNâ€™T MATTER NOW.
ITâ€™S THE LAST MIDNIGHT

ITâ€™S THE BOOM... SPLAT!

NOTHING BUT A VAST MIDNIGHT

EVERYBODY SMASHED FLAT!

NOTHING WE CAN DO...
NOT EXACTLY TRUE:

WE CAN ALWAYS GIVE HER THE BOY.

NO? NO, OF COURSE WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS THE BLAME.
SOMEONE YOU CAN BLAME. FINE

IF THATâ€™S THE THING YOU ENJOY,
PLACING THE BLAME,

IF THATâ€™S THE AIM, GIVE ME THE
BLAME...

JUST GIVE ME THE BOY.

No.

YOUâ€™RE SO NICE. YOUâ€™RE
NOT GOOD, YOUâ€™RE NOT BAD

YOUâ€™RE JUST NICE. Iâ€™M NOT GOOD,
Iâ€™M NOT NICE,

Iâ€™M JUST RIGHT

Iâ€™M THE WITCH. YOUâ€™RE THE WORLD.

Iâ€™M THE HITCH, Iâ€™M WHAT NO ONE BELIEVES,
Iâ€™M THE WITCH.

YOUâ€™RE ALL LIARS AND THIEVES.
LIKE HIS FATHER,

LIKE HIS SON WILL BE, TOO... OH, WHY BOTHER?

YOUâ€™LL JUST DO WHAT YOU DO.
ITâ€™S THE LAST

MIDNIGHT. SO GOODBYE,
ALL. COMING AT YOU FAST,

MIDNIGHT... SOON YOUâ€™LL
SEE THE SKY FALL.

HERE, YOU WANT A BEAN?
HAVE ANOTHER BEAN

BEANS WERE MADE FOR
MAKING YOU RICH!

PLANT THEM AND THEY SOAR...
HERE, YOU WANT SOME MORE?

LISTEN TO THE ROAR: GIANTS BY THE SCORE...!
OH WELL, YOU CAN BLAME ANOTHER WITCH.

ITâ€™S THE LAST MIDNIGHT

ITâ€™S THE LAST VERSE. NOW,
BEFORE ITâ€™S PAST MIDNIGHT

Iâ€™M LEAVING YOU MY LAST CURSE:
Iâ€™M LEAVING YOU ALONE. YOU

CAN TEND THE GARDEN, ITâ€™S YOURS.
SEPARATE AND ALONE,

EVERYBODY DOWN ON ALL FOURS.
ALL RIGHT, MOTHER... WHEN?

LOST THE BEANS AGAIN! PUNISH ME THE WAY YOU DID THEN!
GIVE ME CLAWS AND A HUNCH, JUST AWAY

FROM THIS BUNCH AND THE GLOOM
AND THE DOOM AND THE BOOM

Maybe I shouldn't have
stolen from the Giant...

Maybe I shouldnâ€™t have
strayed from the path...

Maybe I shouldnâ€™t have
attended the Ball...

Yes. Maybe you shouldnâ€™t have...
Where are you going?

Away from here. -But you said we had
to find our way out of this together.

It doesnâ€™t matter whether
weâ€™re together or apart.

We need your help.

You donâ€™t understand. I depended on my wife
for everything. She was the one who helped.

Ã…Ã­ ÃŸÃ‡Ã¤ÃŠ Ã£Ã¤ Ã“Ã‡ÃšÃÃŠÃ¤Ã­

You would leave your child? -Heâ€™ll be
happier in the arms of a Princess...

But wait...

What are you doing here? BAKERâ€™S FATHER: Son.
I donâ€™t want to talk to you.

Itâ€™s because of you all of
this happened. Go away!

Iâ€™m sorry. I did a foolish thing.
Why would you do that?

Why did you take
the Witchâ€™s beans?

They were there and I wanted them. I didnâ€™t think.
I was being careless...

...Selfish.
-Yes.

You stole them and you were caught, and then
you did what you do. You just ran away.

When your mother died, I was...

I hated myself
and I ran from my guilt

and my shame...
... and your son.

Yes, and my son. And Iâ€™m sorry for that.
Then what do you want?

Arenâ€™t you making the same mistake?
Arenâ€™t you running away?

Be better than me, son.

Do better...


If there were just some way we could
surprise the Giant.

Sheâ€™s too tall to surprise.

Ã“Ã¦Ã ÃƒÃŸÃ¦Ã¤ ÃŽÃ¡ÃÃŸ Ã¥Ã¤Ã‡ Ã“ÃŠÃƒÃŠÃ­ Ã£Ã¤ Ã¥Ã¤Ã‡

I knew you wouldnâ€™t give up.

He wouldnâ€™t leave his baby.
It looked like he was going to.

Give me my son.

Hey, hey.

(BABY CRYING)

What are we going to do now? -We need to
rid this kingdom of the Giant... together.

Sheâ€™ll be back soon; hereâ€™s the plan.

Weâ€™re going to feed Jack to the Giant.

Weâ€™re going to use you as bait to
lure the Giant towards the tar pit.

The birds can help! -Oh good friends
we need your help more than ever.

What of the prince?

That doesnâ€™t matter now! Whatâ€™s important
is that we find a way to defeat the Giant.

Oh yes,

thank you birds.

You can talk to birds?
The birds will do their part.

Okay, we donâ€™t have much time.

Iâ€™m excited.
First, we need a weapon.

Your fatherâ€™s being very brave.
Weâ€™re going to be very brave too.

Are you alright, miss?

The Giant went in that direction.

My darling!

My darling!

I did not recognize you. What are you
doing here?

And with a child?

You must go back to the
castle at once. Thereâ€™s

a giant on the loose.
Iâ€™m well aware of that.

My love. What is it?

Maybe Iâ€™m not your only love.
I love you. Truly I do.

If you love me, why did you stray?

I thought if you were mine, that
I would never wish for more.

If this is how you behave as a prince,
what kind of king will you be?

I was raised to be
charming, not sincere.

I think you should go.
Is that what you really wish?

My fatherâ€™s house was a nightmare.
Your house was a dream.

Now I want something in-between.

I shall always love the
maiden who ran away.

And I the faraway prince.

Careful, there. Not so fast.
Don't worry

...this is easier
than a beanstalk.

Theyâ€™re in the tree... over -We
made slings out of my cape.

I wanted to climb a tree too.
Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here to help me.

Whatâ€™s wrong?

I think my mother and my
Granny would be upset with me.

Why?

They said always to make them proud
and here I am about to kill somebody.

Not somebody.

A giant whoâ€™s done a lot of harm.
But a giantâ€™s a person.

Arenâ€™t we to show forgiveness?

MOTHER CANNOT GUIDE YOU.

NOW YOUâ€™RE ON YOUR OWN

ONLY ME BESIDE YOU.

STILL, YOUâ€™RE NOT ALONE.

NO ONE IS ALONE, TRULY.
NO ONE IS ALONE.

I WISH...

I know.

Wait until my mother hears Iâ€™ve slain
the Giant.

Jack!

Jack, thereâ€™s something you have to know.

It's about your mother.
What?

She didnâ€™t make it.

Was she killed by the Giant? -No. It
wasnâ€™t like that. She was fighting

with the Giant, trying
to protect you, and she

was pushed by the Steward
... And... she fell.

The Steward will pay for this.
No, Jack!

After we slay the
Giant, I will slay him.

Youâ€™ll do nothing of the kind. -What he
done was wrong. He should be punished.

Itâ€™s not as easy as that.

MOTHER ISNâ€™T HERE NOW.
WRONG THINGS, RIGHT THINGS...

WHO KNOWS WHAT SHEâ€™D SAY?
WHO CAN SAY WHATâ€™S TRUE?

NOTHINGâ€™S QUITE SO CLEAR NOW.
DO THINGS, FIGHT THINGS...

FEEL YOUâ€™VE LOST YOUR WAY? -YOU
DECIDE, BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

BELIEVE ME. NO ONE IS ALONE.

BELIEVE ME.
TRULY...

PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
FATHERS, MOTHERS,

PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES

HOLDING TO THEIR OWN,
THINKING THEYâ€™RE ALONE.

HONOR THEIR MISTAKES.
FIGHT FOR THEIR MISTAKES...

EVERYBODY MAKES...... ONE
ANOTHERâ€™S TERRIBLE MISTAKES.

WITCHES CAN BE RIGHT, GIANTS CAN BE GOOD.

YOU DECIDE WHATâ€™S RIGHT,
YOU DECIDE WHATâ€™S GOOD.

JUST REMEMBER:

SOMEONE IS ON YOUR SIDE.

OUR SIDE. OUR SIDE. SOMEONE ELSE IS NOT.

WHILE WEâ€™RE SEEING OUR SIDE...

MAYBE WE FORGOT:

THEY ARE NOT ALONE

NO ONE IS ALONE

SOMEONE IS ON YOUR SIDE... NO ONE IS
ALONE...

Go, Jack!

Be careful.

Here she comes!

Wher is the boy?
We have him.

Where?
Heâ€™s hiding in that tree!

Here I am!

You ready?
Ready!

Good birds!
She doesnâ€™t look happy.

Look out Jack!
Jack!

Jack!

Jack!
Where are they? -Jack!

Jack? Mr. Baker?

Jack? Over here!

Jack!

Oh, be careful,

Are you alright?

Where is he?
Heâ€™s not with you?

Jack!
Mr. Baker?

Jack!

Help me.

Jack, Iâ€™m here.

Are you alright?

Are you okay?

Are you alright?

Yeah. Yeah.

We did it! We did it! Come here.

Now we can all return home.
What home?

I have no one to take care of me.
And we have nowhere to go

so weâ€™ll move in with you.
Well...

Of course

Of course. You can come home with me.
And you can come, too.

If you want to. Iâ€™ll gladly
help you with your house.

There are times when I
actually enjoy cleaning.

Here... give him to me.

Sssh!

Sssh!

I know you miss your mother.

-I miss her too.

MAYBE I JUST WASNâ€™T MEANT TO
HAVE CHILDREN... DONâ€™T SAY THAT!

OF COURSE YOU WERE MEANT
TO HAVE CHILDREN.

BUT HOW CAN I GO ABOUT BEING A FATHER
WHEN I HAD NO FATHER TO SHOW ME?

-JUST CALM THE CHILD. -YES, CALM THE CHILD.

LOOK, TELL HIM THE STORY OF HOW
IT ALL HAPPENED. BE FATHER

AND MOTHER,
YOUâ€™LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

Alone.

SOMETIMES PEOPLE LEAVE YOU

HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD.

DO NOT LET IT GRIEVE YOU

NO ONE LEAVES FOR GOOD
YOU ARE NOT ALONE

NO ONE IS ALONE

HOLD HIM TO THE LIGHT NOW.
LET HIM SEE THE GLOW.

THINGS WILL BE ALL
RIGHT NOW

TELL HIM WHAT YOU KNOW...

Once upon a time... in a far
off kingdom...

there lay a small village CAREFUL THE
THINGS YOU SAY at the edge of the woods...

And in this village lived a young maiden...
CHILDREN WILL LISTEN.

A carefree young lad... and a childless baker...
CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU DO

with his wife.

And one day, the baker and his wife were in their shop when
a witch GUIDE THEM ALONG THE WAY CHILDREN WILL GLISTEN.

Burst in, blowing the door off its hinges...
CHILDREN WILL LOOK TO YOU FOR WHICH WAY TO TURN

TO LEARN WHAT TO BE.

CAREFUL BEFORE YOU
SAY â€œLISTEN TO ME.â€

CHILDREN WILL LISTEN.

CAREFUL THE WISH YOU MAKE

WISHES ARE CHILDREN.CAREFUL
THE PATH THEY TAKE...

WISHES COME TRUE,

NOT FREE.
