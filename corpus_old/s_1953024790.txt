the game?

Yeah, Sean Barnes,

Sean! Your glasses!

Come on!

Come on out, Jimmy.
Good job, buddy.

(male voice)
Let's go, come on.

[loud thud]


Oh!

Hold on.

You don't get a drink until
we win or go into overtime.

I just want a beer.
Uh-uh! Look.

You come into my bar
on a Saturday afternoon

you'd better order
your drinks before
or at half time,

but when the game is on,
nobody interrupts. Okay.

Hey! Bee's bar.

My bad, y'all.

35 seconds left.
Let's bring it up!

I want it! I want it!
I'm ready.

[silent praying]

Hut!

[loud thud]

[group cheers]

(group chanting)
Fourteen! Fourteen!

Who is that?

That's my baby!

There's more action
from the dealer.

When will it
be turned around?

Man, you see I'm watching
the game here, Sean.

When you gonna sell
this old 'vette of yours?

When I feel like giving
you a commission.

Now sit down and watch
your brother play ball.

I can't mess around.
I'm up for promotion.

Hey, you think I can get
a ride back?

Sean, I'm watching
the game. C'mon!

Jeez, man.

Watch this, watch this!

Do it D.
Do it D.

You have to watch this.

Oh, yeah!
Do it D!

Timeout! Blue.

Time out!

Shut the fuck up!

Damn!

...back on their
eleven yard line.

Raise that hand again
and they gonna be calling
you Stubby.

Yeah, and don't think
she's playing around.

I've seen that
action before.

Let's go Twizz left,
80 to slice...

Stop running
that bullshit.

The line is
too strong.

All right.
Fuck it!

Line, let 'em come through.

We'll hit 'em with base,
Seattle Blue, on one
on one.

All right!


Set!

Hut!

C'mon!

[loud thud]

[whooping, cheering]

Hey! Hey, could I get

Right now, Bernie's

a beer.

Wow!
Yeah!

Gimme some dap.

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

One, two, three, D!

Hit the showers.
Good game!

Deon, a word.

I just wanted
a quick word with you.


I'm gonna
make this quick.

I don't want to put you
on the spot.

You did something tonight
that was really
wonderful to see.

You showed
tremendous character.

Don't ever forget it.
You won the game for us

without scoring touchdowns.

I want you to know
that every sportscaster
in the country,

from ESPN , CBS
is gonna be showing
highlights of this game

and they're gonna
be showing you
taking people out.

Because of that,
I'd like you
to have this game ball.

I want you to take it
to the N FL with you

and put it on your shelf
and then invite me over,
so I can...

hang out in your big house,
pretend it's mine.

All right?

Thanks, Coach.

You have a good time, tonight.
Not too good.

Four three.

What's that?

What was your fastest
time off the line tonight?

Because, uh,
I ran a 4-3-40.

I was All State
in three different sports.

Come on, we heard
this before.

Then why didn't you
take it?

You got all these
scouts in the stands

taking down your stats
every night.

Deon, you see
the endzone
in your sight,

you take it.

Don't throw your
opportunity away,
like I did mine.

You got one season
left at this university.

You don't
forget that.

We won the game.

Son, I didn't have
anyone watching
my back

who knew the game.

I'm watching your back.
Okay?

You go have fun.

And you party, but
keep your nose clean.

And your dick clean.
I know yo' ass.

Huh?

Yes, sir.

Yeah, I'm
watching yo' ass.

[rap music]

You were amazing tonight.

Alright, alright, how?

How did you see
that shit out there, man?

You had two
guys on you.

Man, you boys
never play flea flicker
when you was a kid, man?

We been running the same
plays since peewee leagues.

We took the ball
every practice.

See how many times
you make it change hands
before we cross the goal.

No shit?

I had two choices
out there tonight.

I coulda held
onto the ball
and went down with it,

or when my quarterback is
running on the right,

I flick that ball out
and we in the end zone!

[all laugh]

It was incredible
to see you.

But I didn't see it.

No, you
didn't see it?

You had
too much
to drink.

[rap music]

Ladies, ladies, ladies.

I overheard y'all
conversation and I got
one question to ask.

Are you all here
for the love of Deon?

You're friends
with Deon?

Hell, yeah.

Y'all wanna
meet him?

Ya gotta dance
with me first.

Well--

He wants to dance.
You wanna dance?

Let's make it happen.
Come on, we at
a party.

Okay.

Come on.

Oh, I like
what I'm seeing.

Hold on.
Let's make
a sandwich.

Five dollar.
Going down.

I'm interracial datin'.

That's my motherfuckin'
man showing off.

That's my boy

[all laugh]

That's why we win
the motherfucking
games, man.

[all laugh]

That's why we won.

Yeah.

Yo, Sean.

Yeah?

Yo.
Hi, man.

What's up, man.

It's a party, man,

I know,
I'm fine.

I knew you was
gonna be here.

Congratulations
on the game.

Yeah, that
went good.

Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
This ain't my scene.

What you need to do
is take care of this
shit right here.

Turn you into
a up and comer.

That way one of these
bitches around here

Nah, that's alright.

Man, fuck

Get air.


Are you alright?

Yeah, probably just
a little dehydrated.

You wanna quit?

Hell no.
Reset that.

I thought so.
Alright, and--go!

High step dancing now.

Okay, as
Ben Jones said,

American jobs are jobs
installing insulation,

putting in solar paneling,
putting in weather proofing,

and we have to decide
do we want to support

a dirty fossil fuel industry
or a clean green one

where are the jobs
gonna be?

Drill, baby, drill, becomes
spill, baby, spill.

Well, that's what I say.
What do you say?

There's no clean
green coal,
come on.

It's an illusion.
Poof.


Man, what we coming
up in here for?

Gonna get
something to drink.

ln a bookstore is
the last place a nigga

Yo.

Yo, what you

Mom's expecting us.

Yeah, I'll

Your brother's a

He can't even come

He don't wanna
go with us anyway.

Good.

[rap music]

Mm, mm, mm.

Just a little more
hot sauce.

Hey.

You smell good.

Well, baby,

Go ahead, run.

Here, y'all

Don't let him push

Didn't even hurt.

I know she was trying
to show me love
and affection.

You see that? You

He's saying he gets
away with it. You
spoil him.

And I don't.

That is my son.

That's my problem
with women.

I always put them up
against my mom

and they don't
stand a chance.

Oh, that's my baby.

[kissing sounds]

That's right.

Do--do--do you

"My Girl"?

You should sing that.
This here is my girl.

Halftime is

Okay.

I'm seeing.

Ooh.


Yaho.

Buddy, what it do,
big homie.

What up.

Man, I came over here
so we can go to the mall,

and I can get at
some bitches.

What do you need me
to go with you for?

I don't need
you to come.

A good pimp
need an assistant.
Go get the car.

Hey, June. I don't
know where you
gonna put

this third helping.

Aw, man.


June, why in the hell do
you come in my house
smelling like that?

What?

But this is
my special cologne.

What? New Cannabis
Cold Water?

No, it works.

The hood rats
love it.

Ms. Barnes, you think
I can get a plate too?

You can go in and
make yourself a plate.

Please?

Thank you.

Hey, man, your
momma got wild.

Don't be looking
at my momma
like that.

Just playing.

I ain't playing
with you.

Aw, shit.
Here come Poindexter.

Hey, Sean.

You gonna chill
and watch the game
with us?

Okay.

What about that girl?
You call her?

No.

Why not?

I didn't feel
right about it.

I mean, how
would that look?

Me calling after
you talked to her?

What?
What the fuck?

Man, you shoulda
gave me the number.

Your brother don't
want no pussy.

Sittin' up with in
motherfucker reading books

playing love jeopardy.

I did not want
to fuck that bitch--

Fuck you, man.

What?

Yo, chill out.

Say that
one more time.

He didn't mean
nothing by it.

One more time!

One more time
for what?

What is going
on in here?

Baby, are
you all right?

I'm all right,
I'm all right.

He pushed me
over the table.

Why you do
that, Sean?

What if he
hurt himself?

No matter,
you always
take his side.

This is not sides, baby.

You coulda hurt your brother,
you coulda hurt yourself.

It's nothing.

It's over some girl he like
and I got her phone number

and I asked him if he called
and he got mad.

Sean, what
are you thinking?

We got the biggest
game of your brother's
career coming up.

Now what if he cut
himself on that glass.

What if he didn't play
to his fullest

in front of all the scouts
that we know are
gonna be there.

Your actions affect
the entire family.

I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

It's all right.

Don't worry about it.

Sean.

[rap music]


Barnes!

I don't need you
getting into any kind
of dick waving contest

to see who can
lift the most weight.

You gotta keep your
legs alive for Oregon
on Friday night.

I'm focused
on the ball game, Coach.

I'm not gonna
mess it up.
I promise.

I believe you.

But I don't want you in
here after another hour.

One hour, you're done.
All right?

I mean it.

I'll be outta here.

One hour.

What the fuck
you doing in here

with the regular
population, homie?

Coach said
if he caught me
in the gym over an hour

he'd kill me,
so I came over here.

You wanna
lift weights?

Just a few minutes.

Yo, D. How much
you weighing there?

216.

Woo.

Let's get this money,
big homie.

Let's do this.
You gonna get far, baby.

This is lightweight
for me.

Let's make
it happen.

One for the mansion,
two for the Maybach,

three for the bitches,
four for the highlight.

Five for the fame.
I said five for the fame.

Man, you always got to go
all messed up.

Man, you ran it on me.

Boy, get mine.

Oh, God.

Hot hot damn.


What the fuck
you laughing at?

What you get
mad at me for?

Fuck this shit, man.
I'ma stay skinny.

That way my dick
look bigger.

The only Heisman trophy pose
I want to do

is when I grab
a bitch purse.

Get back, bitch!

I'm outta here.
You can have
that shit.

Hey.

Hey, you think
you can give
me a spot?

You want
me to spot you?

Why not?

Okay.

Here comes
the muscle.

Okay, you don't
need me so I'm
gonna go.

Help, help.

Say please.

Help, please.

Please, baby,
help me.

See, I did
need you.

How was I?

Great.

It was
my first time.

Your first time?

Mm-hm.

Twelve.
Thirteen.

Fourteen.

Hey, yo, D.
What up?

You just can't be
busting up in here
like that.

Your brother downstairs.
You want me to send him up?

Tell him to
give me a minute.

Right. You want me
to tell him ten?

Tell him fifteen.

I was sitting
right over here.

I know, it's cool.

Alright.

Why'd you hit my head?

"Oh, give me fifteen."

I was just playing.
Forget about ten.

Explained this happened, man.
Set that up, dog.

It's going
down tonight.

It was crazy.

You okay?

No problems.

Give me a call
the next time

you need help
with your homework.

I'll do that.

Hey, what's up?

What's up?

Who's that?

It's my gyology tutor.

Geology.

Yeah, that.
Hey, how you doing?

Hey.

Sharon.

I remember. Tickets.
I promised her tickets.

Yo, June.

What you
need, cuz?

Those tickets
for my brother.

Man, I don't know.

What you mean
you don't know, man.

I hope you
ain't rolled 'em
and smoked 'em.

Come on, man.
Actually, you know
where they at?

They right over there
on the desk, right
next to the computer.

Where, I don't
see no--

Right next to
the computer.

I got it.
It was in
the drawer, man.

Here. These are for
you and my brother.

Thank you.

It's nice to
see you again.

You too.

Thanks for
coming over.

Alright. We'll
catch you later.

Alright.

I can't believe
he called her.

You can't.

Look at Sean.

Yo, you tell 'em
June's popping party
extravaganzas

is top notch.

If they want the deluxe tent,
it's gonna be 2,000 dollars.

It's set up time.
I'm not going in
that shit for free.

That's money
outta my pocket.

Where they do
that at? Damn, man!

All these bitches want me
to throw these big-ass
parties after the game

but don't nobody
want to pay for shit.

They trying to
stress me son!

Hey, don't be
hotboxing up
in my car, man.

There you go,
acting like
Officer Ricky.


Chill out,
chill out for real,

or you're gonna have us
in central booking.

Harry, Harry,
why you trying

to beat me up
on the price, man?

This here is a classic.

Oh, bullshit.
You know the blue book
price says 9,000 dollars.

How about if
I give you eight?

No, no, hey,
no, Harry,

I--I put it
out for 10,000.

I don't know if I can
take anything less
than that.

Eight's a good
price for it.

10,000.

You told me you'd
give it to me
for 12.

Who's this schmuck?

I spoke to my mom.
She said she'd
co-sign a note.

His mommy.

Come on, you got
two men talking
business here.

Huh? Kid.

Alright, look, look.

Uh, you just said
10,000 dollars, right?

Is that what you want?

You know how much
a car like this
is worth?

I ain't never seen
a '66 Stingray
in this kind of shape.

All you gotta do
is put some rims
on it, man,

and a system in it,
ooh, you know--

look, I'll give you
12-5 for it.

What is going on here?
What, are you gonna let

that Bob Marley here
outbid me on this car?
Come on.

Harry, for
Heaven's sakes,

let the kid
have the car.

You're too old
for it anyway.

Wait a minute.

Look, you know this
has always been my
dream car.

Deon. What the
fuck you doing?

I just want my roses
when I can still
smell 'em.

I know, sweetie.
But it's only
a car.

No, not for me.
Look, let me
handle this.

Why don't you go
outside and enjoy
your minivan?

It's what
you like.


I need this
deal, man.

Alright. Look,
here's my final offer.

11,000 dollars.

I'll go get
my checkbook
right now.

Deal?

I'm sorry, kid.

Man, this
is bullshit.

Okay.

I'll be right back.

Excuse me.

11,000 dollars.

This--he's
a natural, man.

Man.

I had no idea you
were gonna do that, man.

You see that?
11,000 dollars.

But I don't get it.

Doesn't the old guy
know he won't get
a chance

to drive it long?

Oh, he knows.

Yeah. He just
wants to go out
on top.

Alright.

Tickets for you and
Mom, last game of
the season.

Oh, good looking out.

Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, that's my bro.

Listen, don't go
passing the glory.

I know, I know.

Yo, I'm gonna run
back to campus.

My ride better not
coming back smelling
like weed either.

Oh, it ain't. But it
might smell like
sex, dog.

He's stupid.

Hey, you joggin back?

Yeah.

Okay, six minute miles,
keep your pace even.

I know, I know.

Okay, alright.

Hey, hey.
11,000 dollars.

You the man.

From your mouth
to God's ears.

Oh, what's up, Sharon?

What are you doing
out here this late
by yourself?

Just closing
the bookstore
for the night.

How far you
live from here?

A couple of blocks
down the quad.

I'll walk with you.
C'mon.

So Sean finally
called you.

Yeah.

What'd he say?

Nothing, he just
offered to give
me the tickets

and brought me over
and that was it.

He didn't say
nothin' else?

No. What was
he supposed
to say?

I don't know.

I appreciate
you walking
me home.

It's nothing.
It's no problem.

Okay, I have to
ask you something.

Why'd you have your
brother call me
instead of you?

I don't know.

I mean, I
was busy.

And it, you know,
he--I wanted to
make sure you came

and he's good
with that kind
of stuff.

Okay. Well, if you wanna
go out, you should
just ask me.

Well, I'm asking
you now.

Okay.

Look at that
pretty smile.

I didn't wake
you up, did I?

I'm good.

Got a seven o'clock
with Coach this morning.

Wanna come
check me out?

I'll be there.

Now you make me
not wanna go.


See you
later, alright?

(male announcer)
One minute, 39 seconds
left in the fourth quarter,

[sports announcer
speaking]

Defense, defense!

Defense!

[whistle blowing]

[players shouting
unintelligible]

Alright.

Ran the ball up the middle.

No gain on the play,
that's gonna force
the fourth down.

And the clock is ticking,
no time outs remaining.

It's gotta
be frustrating
for the Lakers.

Get past the gunner,
the gunner from
the left,

we'll have a wall
for you. Feel me?

Okay.
Got it.

Get it!

[wild cheering]

[crowd ohs]

The clock has stopped.

Let's go!

Just 21 seconds
remaining in the game.

Enough for two plays.

Play, Deon.

Deon!

Come on, Deon,
go get them!

[players shouting]

Ready.

Set.

Hut!

[crowd ohs]

[whistle blowing]

Damn.

lncomplete pass to stop
the clock with 13
seconds remaining.

Seems we can get
the fucking Gatorade.

Bring it up!
Bring it up!

Bring it in, fellas,
here we go.

Let's go PA. Gator 92.
Let's buy protection up front.

This is it, fellas.
Last chance.

Yeah!

Home town, baby, this is
where you do what you do.



[whistle blowing]

Ready.

Set.

Hut.

Yeah, baby!

[crowd cheers wildly]

That's what I'm
talking about!

[wild cheering]

[announcer unintelligible]

Yeah.
See that?
See that? That's it.

[players chanting]

[chanting continues]

We just won, but we
wouldn't have if you
hadn't caught them passes.

Don't touch me,
boy, alright?

You didn't even
wash up yet.


Oh, shit.

Hey, D!


Deon!

[distant ambulance siren]

Is anyone there?

Can anyone hear me?

Is anyone there?

(doctor over mic]
Relax, Deon, you
have to stay still.



Can I get you
something, baby?

I'm okay.

What could they be doing?
We've been here all day.


Sean, go find
somebody, please.

Momma, I already
checked. They're busy.

Look, just go out there
and bring somebody back

who knows
what the hell
is going on.

Please?

What'd I tell ya?

What?

I told you to get
your ass in that
endzone.

Guess what, Bernie?

SportsNet just bumped
your boy up.

That means we're
going to San Diego,

Denver or Miami.


We moving!

Look, we gotta
you outta here,
get you all fixed up.

Miami!


Oh, baby.

I'm sorry
I took so long.

Oh, that's okay,
Doctor. What you
got for us?

We got the M Rl
results and what it's
showing is a growth,

a medio-spinal tumor
in your chest cavity.

And that 's putting
stress on your heart
and your lungs,

and that's
why you fainted.

What does
that mean?

But can he
still play?

He's playing in the
national championships.

At--at this time,
with the placement
of the tumor

any kind of physical
activity could cause
more damage.

Can we have
it removed?

Our preference would
be non-invasive.

Radiation
and chemotherapy

will shrink
the tumor.

What I think we have to do
is we gotta take a wait
and see approach.

We gotta
start chemotherapy
though immediately.

And then within
the next four months

we'll see
where we're at.

Okay? I'll
give you some time.

Excuse me for a second.

We'll work through this.
It'll be alright.

Hey, Doc.

Excuse me for
a minute, Doc,
Doc, hold it.

Do you know who
that is in there?

No, he--

That boy has a future.
He has a gift.

The N FL draft is
not until June.

Are you saying
we can expect a
full recovery

by April or May?

We'll know more
once we see how
his body

reacts to
the treatment.

Chemo and radiation?

Hold on,
that's six months.

You said it would
just take four.

It's always best to
remain optimistic,
don't you think?

Now look, Doc,
I know how the
game's played.

We're just a
little worried.

Eric, please don't--

We are. But all
this stuff is just
between the family.

I need to know it's
not leaving this room.

The hospital maintains the
strictest confidentiality.
He'll be okay, okay?

Thank you, Doctor.

Uh-huh.

Alright, we gotta
keep a lid on this
bullshit, okay?

So we're gonna
tell them you
got pneumonia.

No one has to know
the truth but us.

It does not
leave this room.

No, no, I don't agree
with that, I mean,

we might as well tell
them anyway because
they will find out.

Bernie, I can deal
with Coach Harper
and the university.

What about Miami?
What about the Dolphins?

It's not a
physical limitation.

Worst case scenario,
you're gonna be dropped down
to 9th or 10th or 11th pick.

But you'll still
be first rate.

You'll be okay.

Listen, I know the
championships are
in two weeks,

but you know what?

What those people saw
you do the other night,

they will
not forget you.
I promise you that.

I promise you that.

That's right.

(male professor)
1969, the
summer of love.

So I've been told.

America is
the first country
to land a man on the moon,

and at that same time,
we're number one
in education.

Now, we're
number 18.

And as more and
more jobs require

a college education,
fewer and fewer of us

are actually
graduating from college.

ln the year 2040,
ladies and gentlemen,

China will be the big player,
the big dog, America not.

So where are all
these new jobs
going to be

when you graduate
in the spring?

I would like you all to
come to Thursday's class

prepared to
discuss that. Okay?

Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
See you Thursday.

Be prepared.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Hey, stranger.

Hey, Sharon.

Hey.

Look, this is kinda
awkward but--

I've been trying
to call your brother
for the past couple of days

but I haven't
heard back from him.

Everybody's saying
he's got pneumonia.

Is he alright?

Yeah.

You don't like talking
about your brother
much, do you?

I think he can talk
better for himself.

Fair enough.

So, what's
up with you?

I'm on my way
to the crew lab,

working on my resume.

Oh, well,
show it to me.

Why?

'Cause I got
some resume skills.

No, for real.
I look at a lot.

Alright, look--

Let's see
what you got.

Don't clown 'cause
it's not finished yet.

What?

You interned
for a designer
in New York City?

Yeah. I've always
wanted to be in fashion,

so I took a chance
and went to New York.

Okay, well,
I'd move it
up on your resume.

Alright, you might know
a little something
about resumes.

Yeah, I think I do.

Can't you give me
pills or something
instead of that?

He needs
to relax.

I told you he
doesn't like needles.

Come on, Deon,
you gotta do
this now.

You remember when
you was six years old,

and we had
that big thunderstorm,

scared you so much
you hid under the bed

you thought it was
the wrath of God?

That was
a long time ago.

I know, baby,
I know, but listen.

Do you remember
what I told you then?

I told you there
was nothing to
be afraid of,

that it wasn't
God punishing you,

that he was trying to
give you something.

All that lightning
and thunder,

light so
bright you could
see inside your eye?

What'd I tell you?

It was God giving
you superpowers.

I remember.

Yeah. So now,
I want you to
lay back.

Lay back.
Come on.

That's right.
Just relax.

Close your eyes.

And let God
bathe you in
His light.

Absorb the power.

Okay. Okay,
just lay down.
That's right.

Close your eyes now.

Take something scary
and turn it into
a strength.

And the next day,
oh, I can still
see your little face.

You marched out
onto that football field
with those super powers

like you could fly
over anybody and land
in the end zone.

Like you could run
like the wind

and never get caught.

And I was
just screaming.

Come on, D,
come on.

Use your super powers.
Use your super powers.

[angry shouting]

I am disappointed
in you!

[angry shouting]

[shouting continues]

You are not my son!

[shouting continues]

[equipment beeping]

Excuse me.

Excuse me,
I told you
on the phone,

we can't continue
like this.

We are following the
treatment plan that
you signed off on.

No, these costs
are out of control.

We are going to need
an updated credit card
on file for you.

For what?

Any ancillary
charges that--

Oh, ancillary charges
like...

129 dollars for
a mucus recovery system?

Fees like that
are often charged.

It's a damn
box of Kleenex.

Now I am not giving
you another credit card

and I'm not signing
any of your papers

until somebody
in this administration

explains to me why
I have to take out
a loan

to cover the costs
of buying Band-Aids
and gauze pads!

I'll provide my own.

I will provide
my own.

Excuse me, Doc, Doc,
do you know where
Dr. Brintall is?

I'm covering
for him but--

Oh, you cover
for me, listen, listen.

Deon Barnes. We brought
him in four months ago.

He's a football player.
We did the chemotherapy,

radiation, all that,
and it cost us a great
deal of money.

Oh, I don't get
into billing issues.

Wait, hold
on, then.

When we brought him in,
he was 214 pounds.

Now he little
and skinny.

We trying to get
this boy ready for
the N FL draft.

All he does
is sleep all day.

Well, in aggressive cases
like his that's
not uncommon.

It's a side effect
of his radiation.

What you need to do
is get him out of bed,

get him active
and see how he feels.

That's the best
thing right now.

Oh, but he--

Home sweet
home, baby doll.

Now you stay
right there.

I'll come around
and get you.

Okay. Okay,
take your time.

There we go.

Alright.

Here we go.

Oh, look!
It's Deon.

[kids greeting]

They're so happy
to see you.

He's gonna play
with you later.

Okay?

Okay, come here.


I'll get this.

There.

I'll take your
shoes off.

Okay.

Oh, I--
I talked to Sean.

He called.

Wait, I'll help you.

Alright.

I'll get you
in there.

Alright.

There you go.

You want some of that
ginger ale with
crushed ice

like you had
in the hospital?

Hm.

It's good for your
stomach, right?

I'll be right back.

The interviewer
made me so nervous.

How did
the interview go?

They had me meet
with the supervisor

and her direct
manager, and
I was there

for over
three hours.

Oh, well,
that's good.
Yeah! Real good.

Well, that
was a lot.

I think they
liked me.

What's not to like.

I mean, worst
case scenario,
you know.

If it doesn't work
out, there's a position
over at the dealership.

I mean, it's
not fashion, but--

Sean, it is so nice
to get a job for Sharon.

I would appreciate
that 'cause--

Hey, D, go ahead
and eat your food.

I'm almost half
done with mine.

Eric, if he's
not hungry--

you don't have
to eat, Deon, okay?

But I did make
some of that pecan pie.

You want some?

Pecan pie everybody?

I love pecan pie.

Bernie, you gotta
at least let him
get his own stuff.

I mean, he's been
home for two weeks.

He's just been
sitting on his ass.

Look, you have
to be patient.

It takes time.
I know Deon.

He's going to do things
in his own time.

He goes to take a dump,
you're there to help him.

Okay, that's disgusting,
that's enough.

I don't feel like
hearing that.

Look, the cancer
knocked him down.

We just have to
be patient.

It's not how many times
you get knocked down.

It's how many times
you get back up.

Would you please stop
with that ra-ra football
bullshit?

I know my boy,
I know he's gonna
be okay.

He's not a boy.
And you can't teach
him how to be a man.

The goddamn president
of the United States
was raised by a woman.

Barack Obama
was raised
by single mothers.

He don't play
football, do he?

He play basketball.
Shut the--.

Look, get the pecan pie.
I'll get the dishes.

I have finals
and stuff

so I think I'll
be heading out.

I'll walk you out.

I got it.


Sorry about that.
That was embarrassing.

No, no,
it's all good.

They're all trying
to help you from
their own perspective.

What about you?

What about me?

Things different now
that I got sick?

No. It's been tough.

It's just--

You interested
in somebody else?

Not at all.

I've just got--
[cell phone rings]

I'm sorry.

It's my mother.

I'll call you later.

Okay.


Two.

Deon!

Seventeen.

Eighteen.

That is great!


You couldn't even
do that this time
last week.

Look, I just came
to apologize.

Eric acted
so damn crazy.

You know, fussing
in front of--Sharon
and everything.

Do you like her?


Yeah.

I see you
boxed up the TV.

Well, we just
have to send some
of this stuff back,

that's all. It's
just a delay.

I know how much
you like that
flat screen.

I do but it's just
a hiccup, that's all.

Sweetheart, you gonna get
better in your own time

and we gonna get rid
of this crappy ass
little house

and we gonna be
down in Miami,

livin' it, honey.

And we gonna get
everything we deserve
in life, you'll see.

I'm sorry, Ma.

I didn't mean
to get sick.

Oh, sweetie.
Don't apologize
for that.

What you sayin'?

I don't know why
this is happening.

I mean, I didn't do nothing
to nobody, I didn't
do anything.
