I hate television.

Gives me headaches.

...makes your

color-treated hair...

You know, I heard there's

so many magnetic waves traveling
through the air

because of TV and telephones,
that we're losing, like

ten times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

Like, all the molecules
in our heads are all unstable.

All the companies know
about it

but they're not
doing anything about it.

It's, like, a big conspiracy.

You can pick something.

I don't care.

Say hello to luscious,
full bod...

You have any idea
how many electro-rays

are traveling
through our head every second?

I got a better one.

Have you heard about
this videotape

that kills you
when you watch it?

What kind of tape?

A tape, a regular tape.

People rent it, I don't know.

You start to play it

and it's, like,
somebody's nightmare.

Then suddenly,
this woman comes on

smiling at you, right?

Seeing you through the screen...

and as soon as
it's over...

your phone rings.

Someone knows
you've watched it

and what they say is...

''You will die
in seven days''

and exactly seven
days later...

Who told you that?

Somebody from Revere.
I don't...

Who told you?

What's your problem?

I've watched it.

It's a story, Katie.

No, me and Josh,
we saw it last weekend.

I thought you were
with your parents.

I wanted to tell you.

You were with
Josh all weekend?

Some of his friends
got this-this place

up in the mountains.

They were trying
to record a football game.

I guess the reception
was so bad...

What are you talking about?

Listen to me!

When we played the tape,
the game wasn't there.

It was...

What?

Wh-What was it?

It was something else.

We thought it was
some kind of sick joke...

and then the phone rang.

It was a week ago...

one week ago tonight.

You're just trying to scare me.

Oh, my God, Katie!

Are you okay?

Katie... oh, my...

You freak!

You totally fell for it!

No.

So... did you guys,
you know, do anything?

Like what?

Oh, my God, you totally did!

You ho!

Tell me now!

There really is a tape?

This is so lame.

Wait, don't!

Embrey residence.

Hello.

Hi, Mom.

Yeah, that was Becca.

My mom says hi.

She's glad you're here.

Ask her where she keeps
the Vicodin.

Yeah, we're about
to go to sleep.

Okay. Yeah, I will.

Okay! Okay, yeah, yeah, I will.

No, I won't.

Bye, Mom.

Becca, quit being a bitch.

Where's the remote?

Becca, quit it!

Becca, can you hear me?

Don't tell me what to write!

That asshole's screaming
for my attention

and I'm not going
to give it to him.

I am being objective!

Listen, Harvey,
you punctilious prick

you touch my column

and I'm coming down there
and poking your eye out

with that little red pencil
you like so much!

Harvey?

Shit!

Hey...

Hey.

Sorry I'm late.

No worries.

I'll wait in the car.

Have you got a moment,
Ms. Keller?

Um, sure.

Call me Rachel.

Please, sit down.

He certainly is
very independent, isn't he?

Oh, yeah, he sure is.

I never have to tell him
to do anything.

Well, if that's a problem

you'd be the first teacher
in history to say so.

Ms. Keller...

Rachel.

I know that Aidan recently lost

his cousin...

Yes, and I'm doing what I can

to find him some good
daycare. It's just...

Oh, no,
that's not what I meant.

By all means, take your time.

I know they were very close,
Aidan and his cousin.

Yeah. They spent a few
nights a week together.

Did he talk to you
about her death?

Well, like you said, he's
not the talkative type.

That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

He knows I'm there.

Yes, I'm sure he does

but he may be expressing himself
in... other ways.

I'd like to show you something.

That's his cousin.

That's Katie.

Ms. Keller...
I'm bothered by these drawings.

Listen, I appreciate
your concern

but my son lost his best
friend three nights ago.

He's just trying
to deal with it.

Yes, I understand,
but these pictures...

Are Aidan's way
of working it out...

of expressing himself,
like you said.

He'll be okay.

You say she died
three nights ago?

Yeah, that's right.

Aidan drew these last week.

What?

Nothing.

Shall we read something?

I'm kind of tired.

Okay.

Sweet dreams.

We don't have enough time.

Oh, honey,
I know I've been working a lot

and I'm sorry

but I promise you,
I'm going to make it up to you.

I'm not talking about that.

I'm talking about
time before we die.

You have lots of time.

So, you know when I'm going
to die?

No.

No one does

but I know you don't have
to worry about it.

Katie knew.

She told me.

Katie told you she was going
to die?

She said she didn't
have enough time.

Good night, Rachel.

Oh, shit!

Aidan...

Goddamn it!

Honey?!

Have you seen my black dress?

Aidan?

Have you seen my black...

dress?

It's a little wrinkled.

It's fine.

Yeah. Thank you.

Kids don't have strokes...

unless they're on drugs.

So, then,
why the closed coffin?

Oh, Ruthie.

I'm so sorry.

You all right, Dave?

Yeah, I'm fine.

How are you?

He sleeps all day.

He doesn't move.

It's too much for him.

It doesn't make
any sense, Rachel.

I spent four hours
on the Internet

and I couldn't find
one single case

of a 16-year-old girl's
heart just stopping.

I spoke to three different
doctors and not one of them

could tell me exactly what
happened to my daughter.

She was close... with you.

And Aidan.

But she confided in you.

Yeah, but she never
said anything...

nothing that would explain
what happened.

But you could find out.

It's what you do, isn't it--

ask questions?

Rachel, please.

I saw her face.

I knew Becca.

I mean, she was a little
intense, but she wasn't crazy.

They don't put you in booties
and a straightjacket

if you're just freaked out.

Something scared the shit
out of her.

Hi.

So, who's
in the mental hospital?

Becca...

Katie's friend.

Oh, right.
She was the one who was...

There when it happened.

So, what do you think
they were doing up there?

Oh, thanks.

I remember I was that age.

Me and my girlfriend used to

sneak up to my room, get high.

Do you think maybe
she was into...?

It's not about that.

It's about the tape.

Kellen, don't even.

What tape?

The one that kills you
when you watch it.

Oh, please.

What was on the tape?

I haven't seen it, obviously.

But Katie told you

she saw this tape?

Not Katie.

I heard it from her boyf...

You heard it from who?

She was dating
this guy Josh.

He goes to Revere.

It was kind
of a secret.

Kind of?

Where is he-- Josh?
Is-Is he here?

Josh is dead.

What?

What happened?

Supposedly, he killed himself...

the same night that Katie died.

Aidan... what are
you doing in here?

Come on.

We shouldn't be in her room.

It's not her room anymore.

10:00 p.m.

10:00 p.m.

Time of death, Wade

that's all I want to know.

The name's Katie Embrey.

Pull the report
and read the time.

No, that's okay. I'll hold.

''Punctilious prick''?

Nice alliteration, huh?

You're fired.

No, I'm not.

Yes, you are.

No, I'm not.

I'm cooking too good a story.

What is it?

Yeah, I'm still here.

Shh!

Okay, so what's
the time of death?

Hi. I was wondering...

Pick a card, any card.

Go ahead.

Okay, put it back.

Don't let me see it.

That your card?

No.

Damn.

I was wondering
if you'd remember someone

from a week ago.

Was there a problem?

It's my niece.

She sort of ran out

on her parents.

No.

I have some photos here.

That's her and her friends.

I think they stayed
here a night or so.

Yeah, they were in Cabin 12.

They didn't pay.

Had a number of complaints,
about the TV, mainly.

Uh, reception's never good here.

That's why we bought

tape players for videos.

Quite a selection.

Mostly they're hand-me-downs

left by other guests.

Anyway, they didn't pay.

And kids like that
sometimes don't.

Miss?

You know, I'm kind of tired.

I'm thinking I might take a nap
before I drive back.

I'll take Cabin 12.

Hey.

This is your card, right?

That's it.

Seven days.

I'm going to school.

Hold up.

What do you think?

Well, it's a pretty cool effect.

What does this have to do
with the tape?

Take my picture.

Are you going to look at me

at least?

This the same camera?

No. Scan the rest.

So, what do you think?

Well, look, I thought you said
this was about a tape.

I'm thinking maybe
you shouldn't see it.

No, I should know
more about it first.

Well, isn't that why I'm here?

So you can benefit
from my wisdom?

Four kids are dead, Noah.

Not from watching a videotape.

Come on, show it to me.

Roll credits.

That was very student film.

I'm sure it's a lot...
scarier at night.

You going to get that?

So, you been working a lot?

I'm not tired, Noah.

Okay.

That tape didn't scare you?

No, not really. Sorry.

Four people are dead.

Yeah, but like I said,
not from watching...

Four people who watched it.

Come on, we watched it.

We're hanging.

It... takes a week.

Right. Yeah, I'm just
going to go downtown.

I got to pick up some
cameras from this guy

and then I got
to prep this thing

that I may end up
doing next week.

--Noah...
--Hmm?

Would you say that I'm gullible?

No.

Easily rattled?

Definitely not.

I mean, you're a little

highly strung maybe.

And you ain't much
of a dresser.

Who made it?

Where'd it come from?

All right.

Make me a copy.
I'll see what I can do.

Thanks.

Yeah.

You sure this is a copy?

Yeah, why?

The numbers are all screwed up.

The same problem
got copied, I guess.

That's impossible.

The numbers of
the control track

they put on the tape
whenever it's recorded

which means theoretically,
there shouldn't be any images.

Hey, Noah, can you pretend
for one minute

that I don't read
Video Geek Magazine?

Okay, when you record a tape

the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature

for whatever did the recording

like a camcorder,
VCR, whatever.

So the control track could
tell us where it came from.

But to not have one...

I mean, that's like being born
without fingerprints.

Then, how did this get recorded?

I don't know.

But I'm going to find out.

All right, take a look.

You should be able
to see the camera here

in the reflection.

The angle's straight
on, but you don't.

Hmm. What's that?

It looks like she's walking away

whoever she is.

No, I mean up there at the top.

Oh, no, that's
just the tracking.

I can fix that.

Whup, sorry.

Wait, go back.

There's something there.

Yeah, you're right.

--There's more picture.
--Hold on.

I'm going to stretch
the alignment.

Yeah, it's working.

Yeah, it won't go any further.

Okay, keep going.

No, no, no, no, let me do it.

Wait, it won't go any further.

It won't go any further!
Get...

--Let me do it.
--Shit!

Oh...

Hey, Noah

I picked up the cameras.

They're in really good shape.

Did you see the reprints I did

of that Guatemala stuff?

'Cause they came out kind of...

overexposed.

You working?

This is a friend, Rachel Keller.

She writes for the ''P.I.''

Rachel, this is Beth,
my assistant.

Well, I prefer
''partner in crime.''

She's a journalism student
at Kirkland, actually.

Well, I'll stay
out of your way.

I'm not even here.

Rachel is researching a story.
It's this video hoax.

It's sort of interesting.
So you know video.

Why don't you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking.

You know, I'm late.

I really should go.

Yeah, but why are you taking...?

I got to go.

It's good to meet you.

So you're taking the tape?

I don't want her to see it.

Whoa. You don't
want her to see it?

What about me
seeing it?

You had no problem
showing it to me.

I did have a problem.

You're angry.

I'm not angry.

Oh, no? What
are you then?

In a hurry.

Look, I'm sorry, but I'm
not going to get all worked up

over some high school rumor.

What are you thinking?

I'm thinking this is
the part where I say

''You're a flake,
never finishes anything.''

Then you say
I'm ''an obsessive bitch.

Needs to lighten up.''

Then I storm out

all pissed off, kicking myself
for ever thinking

that you could just...

grow up.

So, why don't we just
cut to that part right now

and save ourselves
a lot of grief?

All right.

Bye.

Watch out, missy.

Bad luck.
You don't need that.

Becca?

Becca.

We're almost there.

Summer, actually.

So circle gets that square.

We take a break,
while you check this out.

This is how you can be part...

Do you remember anything

about that night...

that night with Katie?

Do you remember...

how she died?

Becca?

She told you about a videotape,
didn't she?

She was afraid, wasn't she?

Something was happening to her.

Becca...

how did she die?

Please.

I need to know.

And you will.

She'll show you.

Who?

Who will show me?

Not now.

Four days.

Yeah, well, your home VCRs

will give you a tracking window

but they won't
let you stretch it.

There's no point, really, unless
you're talking restoration.

Archives will come in here

with these crummy old tapes
sometimes.

Tracks totally shot--
servos can't line them up.

But the big box here's
a warhorse.

Totally analog.

She'll read to the very edge
of your tape.

Just don't force her or
she'll get pissy with you.

Your tracking, your monitor,
your printer, if you need it.

So, uh...

what are we watching,
home movies or something?

I'd really
rather watch it alone.

Really.

Whatever.

Come on...

Come on.

Lighthouse.

Shit.

Hello? Somebody?

Damn.

Something you needed help with?

Hey, you... you got a... ya...

Well, that seems to be
the lot of it.

Thank you.

''Moesko Island.''

''Anna Morgan.''

Oh, my God.

''Mysterious Sickness
Strikes Morgan Ranch Horses.

''Investigators
search for answers

after second horse drowning.''

''Anna Morgan.''

''Horses Recovering
After Breeder's Suicide.''

''...suffered from
hallucinations.''

''Eola... County Psychiatric.''

What happened to you, Anna?

Pack of Double Lights.
Thanks, Lani.

$15.33.

You're gonna die.

My cousin was two packs a day.

Used the patch...
never looked back.

All right, well,
I'll keep that in mind.

Have a nice day.

You, too.

Hi.

Sorry I'm late.

Uh... mmm... no. No problem.

Everything okay?

Oh, yeah. He was an angel.

I-I... went in to tell him
that it was bedtime

and he was already
under the covers.

And then he read me
a bedtime story.

Um... 

he learned the word ''conundrum.''

Really?

Yeah. And then...
he drew my picture.

Well, here you go.

Thanks.

Sure.

Hey, Ruthie, it's me.

I'm sorry to call so late,
but I need a favor.

I have to go upstate
to do this story

and I need you
to watch Aidan for me.

Oh, Rachel, I don't know.

How long will you be gone?

It's just for two days,
I promise.

This isn't the best time for me.

Rachel? Rachel, are you there?

Hold on a sec...
Sorry.

Rachel?

Is this about Katie?

Ruthie...

Aidan?

No!

Why, baby, why? Why?!

I couldn't sleep.

Who is she, Rachel?

Leave him alone!

Rachel?

Noah...

L-Listen to me. R-Rachel...

I need to talk to you, okay?

I...

I believe you.

Rachel, you there?

He... He watched the tape.

Who? Who watched it?

Our son.

You took my picture.

I've seen you.

When I'm in the yard at school.

You're there.

You wish I was around more?

No.

Do you want to be around more?

Rachel and I were...

Young.

Mom's told me that story.

The thing is, I...

I don't think
I'd make a good father.

Maybe it was because
my own was...

such a... disappointment.

Thing is, I don't want
anyone else to do it, either.

Be your father.

It's a conundrum.

Yeah, it is.

Time to go, mister.

I'm not finished.

Noah said to make one for you.

You could almost draw

a line through her life.

On one side,
there's this happy woman

who spends her time with her
husband, riding horses

everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

Her face, there's... light,
there's pride.

And then, one day,
something happens

and she takes
this hard corner

and the light... goes out

and then she ends up
at Eola County Psychiatric

all alone.

What happened to her?.

l don't know yet

but l think it has something
to do with the horses.

lt think we should go
to the island together.

lt's Tuesday, Noah.

l only have one day left.

l need you to go to the
hospital

and find out as much
as you can about Anna.

The images on the tape
are leading us somewhere.

Katie saw them all, too.

I think... before you die

you see the ring.

Shit!

Hey, Rach! Wait!

A daughter?
