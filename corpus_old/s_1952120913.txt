[Scattered Groans] [Man]
It's been three days!

We're starving!
Where's our food?

Shut up, ya scum!

Give me some!
Give me some!

I swear it's true.
The Sword of Hera is real.

Some people are dumb enough
to believe anything.

I saw a damn map. Now, why'd
that be if the sword wasn't real?

I think I know a way
to settle this.

We go after it.

No one's talkin' to you,
woman.

Lemme ask you something.

When you got your nose pierced,
did it hurt?

Not after a couple
mugs of mead. Yeah.

It's too bad they don't
let us drink in here, huh?

Yeah? Why's that?


That's it, Arciana!

You just bought yourself
a night in the hole.

Gimme the keys!

I'm going after the sword!

The rest of you can stay in here
and rot, or come with me and live!

[Cheers, Shouts]

That is the last time I let
you drag me off to see a play.

When did you become
such a philistine?

Look, if you're gonna insult me,
at least use words I can understand.

Maybe you didn't like it
because you didn't get it.

What's to get? This guy gets
some money from some pirates,

he goes traveling around the world, and
then just before he gets to where he's going,

he falls in the sea, and he's got so
much gold in his pockets, he drowns!

Whoo!
That's just the plot.

Yeah?
Well, there's the meaning.

Okay, okay. Enlighten me.

Okay. Never accept gifts...

paid for by
other people's suffering.

What about my suffering?

Listen, they could just come
out and say it, couldn't they?

Hercules!
There's been a prison break.

Inmate by the name of Arciana
took off with a posse.

Word is they're headin' toward
Mycenae. Sure could use your help.

You got it. Well, looks
like we're going to Mycenae.

Hope they haven't got any theater there.
Uh, sir...

Did he pay for that?

Thank you, sir.
Keep the change.

So the bartender
says to the horse,

"Why the long face?"

Get it?

Don't quit your day job.

Damn!

[Panicked Yelping,
Screaming]

I'm sure you've heard of Hercules. Yes?
Uh-huh.

Good, because I need you
to send him a message.

[Man Narrating] This is the
story of a time long ago,

a time of myth and legend,

when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

and they plagued mankind
with suffering.

Only one man dared
to challenge their power...

Hercules.

Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,

a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

He journeyed the earth, battling the
minions of his wicked stepmother, Hera,

the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

But wherever
there was evil,

wherever an innocent
would suffer,

there would be... Hercules.

[Screeching]
[Roaring]

Hail!

make prisons like they used to.

Hmm. I wonder what the inmates
are looking for in Mycenae.

Maybe it's
the four-star restaurants.

Or maybe they're after the Sword
of Hera. Okay, that's a new one.

No, not really.
It's been around a long time.

Disciples move it from temple
to temple to keep it hidden.

Closest one's in Mycenae.

And let me guess: He who
possesseth the sword...

shall pierce his enemies
unto the quick, yea,

and smite them into the blood-bespattered
earth of their forefathers.

And I thought you didn't
like theater. [Laughs]


[Bird Cawing]

Said the serpent to the man,

"To know me
is to know yourself."

You take my breath away.

me from coming back to you.

Nothing.

My husband was lost at sea
two moons ago.

An oracle told me
he's still alive.

Why do I feel like
I know that girl?

In another life...
she was my wife.

Serena.
I've missed you, Hercules.

How's your husband?

Well, he's no Hercules.
And you're no Serena.

I'm whoever you
want me to be.

I've chosen to appear
in this form because...

it's pleasing to you.

Actually, it's insulting.
Who are you?

Why don't you call me "Sin"?

We have an old acquaintance
in common, you and I.

Does the name
"Xerxos" ring a bell?

Xerxos is dead.

Ooh. Dead to your world...
reborn in mine.

But he's escaped my domain.

Your domain?
Mm-hmm.

See, Tartarus is too good
for some people.

When Hades finds a special case,
he... he sends them to me.

I want you to help me
bring him back.

Huh! What makes you think
I'd help you?

Because you know Xerxos,

and you know
what he's capable of.

I'll admit, Hercules. There have
been times I cursed your name.

You kept so many
from entering my domain.

But you see,
we need each other now.

I doubt it.

My powers are weak
in this realm.

Only our combined strength
will bring Xerxos to his knees.

Thanks, but I already have a partner.
Yeah, and we work alone.

Then as a gesture
of goodwill,

let me offer you boys
a little tip.

Xerxos is headed
to Mycenae.

We'll meet again.

Boy, Mycenae sure is
popular today.

If this guy is really back, we have
to stop him before we find Arciana.

Wh-Wha... Who is he?

When you were a kid, did you ever
hear stories about the bogeyman?

Yeah, but everybody did.
Well, he's real.

His name is Xerxos.

His first victims were his
own family. [Muffled Screams]

He was caught the next day, and
when the magistrate asked him...

if he had anything
to say for himself,

he said...

Yeah, I enjoyed it.

He was the first juvenile
ever sentenced to death.

But before the execution,
he broke out of prison.

After that, Xerxos was blamed for
every murder that ever went unsolved.

How do you know all this? Because I'm the one
who finally caught him and brought him back.

To be executed?
Yeah.

Whoa. Then he owes you one.
I'm sure that's how he sees it.

Hercules, I know I don't have
to tell you to be careful,

but be careful.

That Serena look-alike...

It's obvious she wanted
more from you than just help.

I know.
[Bird Cawing]

What's it say?

"I enjoyed it."

Old habits die hard.

Yeah. That's not the
only thing. [Sword Clanks]

Ooh! This guy's
seriously disturbed.

[Serena Giggles]
Now that's putting it mildly.

When Xerxos escaped from me, he
took the power of my realm with him.

Not even a god
can stop him now.

Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I'm not interested in your help.

You're gonna have to spell
it out for her, Hercules.

to hold your tongue, Lolaus.

Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

Without my power,
you won't succeed.

And you're doing this, uh, out of
the goodness of your heart, right?

I don't like loose ends.
Xerxos is mine!

I want him back!
Isn't that nice, Lolaus?

[Scoffs]
Come on.

We have graves to dig.

You know, Hercules, pride has
always been my favorite sin.

I just hope yours doesn't cost any
more innocent people their lives.

[Scattered Chattering]

over there! Hey!

It's not her.

Whoa!
We're looking for a woman.

Her name's Arciana.

She's an escaped convict.

I've seen her.

She's camped in the forest.

I could take you to her.

What did this girl
do anyway?

She killed one of my
men. Ha-ha! Only one?

What do you mean by that? Well,
here's a question for you:

What kind of a man decides to
make his living as a prison guard?

The kind that wants to see
people get what they deserve.

Ahh. You like to watch
people suffer, do you?

I know the feeling.


[Guards Screaming, Distant]

Aah! Get outta here!
Into the woods!

Xerxos!

I see you got my message.

We'll see how much
you enjoy my reply.

Heh!

Oh, now you're gonna have to
do a whole lot better than that.


Come on, little man.
Show me your stuff.

Oh, gods!

Hoo! Yaah!

No. Not yet.

I wouldn't wanna deprive myself
the pleasure of seeing your face...

twist in anger
with every new life I take.

Their blood
is on your hands.


Catch me later.

[Both Groaning]

You all right?
Ooh, never better.

[Blows Nose]
[Serena Laughing]

He'll kill again, Hercules.
Count on it.

Uh!

Let me give you
the strength to stop him.

I can stop him without you.
Probably.

Eventually. But how many people
will die in the process?

With my power,
you can do it faster.

Don't listen to her,
Hercules.

Hercules, don't listen...
She might be right.

You can't... This is only
the beginning, Lolaus.

How can you trust her?

I don't. But it doesn't look
like I have a choice.

I knew you'd see it my way.

What are you doing?

Giving you my power. Or would
you prefer a lightning bolt?

Just get it over with.

Huh!

Herc? You all right?

He's all right, all right.
He's stronger than ever.

I've given you the power
to defeat Xerxos.

He's after me, Lolaus.

I don't wanna make you a target.
You go after Arciana.

Wait a second. I
go where you go. Oh.

There is something
you should know...

now that we're
all a... team.

I don't know if Xerxos was just careless
the night he set fire to his home,

but he left someone alive.

[Parents Screaming]

Arciana. That's his sister.

If she's as bad as he is...
Oh, no.

Unfortunately, she's not. You see,
she wasn't born a rotten apple,

but her upbringing left
something to be desired,

jumping from orphanage
to orphanage.

It's hard not to grow up bitter,
wouldn't you think?

If she gets her hands on that sword,
she'll take her bitterness out on the world.

We find Arciana,
we find Xerxos.

Where is the sword?
It isn't here!

And even if I knew where it was,
I wouldn't tell you!

Oh, so you would pay for your loyalty to Hera
with your life. All the gods hear our prayers!

We owe them our allegiance!
The gods are laughing at us.

You know, I prayed
for their help once.

But my prayers, they were
ignored. That was their right.

[Wheezes, Coughs]

It was their mistake.
[Grunts]

Burn this place to the ground.

They don't get
many visitors.

Girl used to come by and
drop off flowers, but...

haven't seen her
in a long time.

She tell you her name? Oh,
it was quite a while ago.

I think she said her
name was, uh, Arciana?

Don't hold me to it.

Shame what happened
to her folks.

Really?
What happened to them?

They gave birth to a monster.

You tell me something,
gravetender.

You think a monster
can grow a conscience?

I wonder what Xerxos
wants with his sister?

Maybe he came back to
finish what he started.

Or maybe he wants to team up
with her again. It doesn't matter.

Xerxos is going back where he came
from, and I'm sending Arciana with him.

not the world's most model citizen,

but we don't know if
she's as bad as Xerxos.

They share the same blood. That's
all I need to know. Are you okay?

Fine. You don't sound
like your normal self.

What's that supposed to mean? It means, since
when has robbery been punishable by death?

Aren't you tired of giving people
the benefit of the doubt, Lolaus?

Of having them disappoint
you over and over again.

They're criminals.

Now, that's reason enough
to kill them both.

[Scattered Chattering]

What price?

It's cheaper.

To your health.

Excuse me. Hey!

Thank you. I'm looking
for a woman named Arciana.

Has anyone seen her?

You're the second guy
to ask about her.

And this guy let you live? [Laughs]
What sort of question is that?

Uh, which way did he go?

Well, I'm answering so many questions,
I should start charging for my time.

What's it worth to you?

What's it worth to me?
You heard.

You want answers...
gonna cost ya.


Sorry, I, uh...
I'm a little hard of hearing.

You were about to tell me which
direction this guy was headed.

Hercules, he won't be able to tell
you anything if you're choking him.

Hey!

Road west out of town.

Thank you.

Hercules, was that
really necessary?

We got what we came for.
Hey, wait a minute.

Hercules! Stop!

What?
It's like the play we saw.

You don't accept a gift that's been
paid for with other people's suffering.

Serena is evil!

And whatever
she's done to you,

it's poisoning you.

I had a feeling this was gonna happen.
What do you wanna do?

Exactly what we came here to do: Find
Xerxos and send him back where he came from.

Till then, you're just gonna
have to put up with me.

How much longer do we
have to lead him around?

Until his hatred consumes him,
and he takes a life in anger.

So many souls denied to me
by one single man.

Today he'll pay for them
with his own.

I made the mistake of
underestimating Hercules once.

I'd advise you not to
make the same mistake.

I'm touched by your concern
for my well-being, Xerxos.

Let's just say I wanna make sure
you keep your end of the bargain.

You've given me no reason
to violate our agreement.

You'll have time to see Arciana
once Hercules is mine.

One thing puzzles me though. Why
the sudden interest in your sister?

That's my business.

Very well.

But make no mistake about it. [Voice
Deepens] Your soul belongs to me.

It's not something
I'm likely to forget.

Don't look so disheartened.

You'll have Hercules to
keep you company soon enough.

Excuse me, Hercules?

Oh, my daughter, she's been in
bed with a cough for days now.

It would mean so much to her
if you came by to say hello.

Sure.

No problem.
I'll just hold her hand...

and tell her she can look
forward to a long life of famine,

senseless war, incurable disease,
petty gods and hungry Hydras.

On the plus side, if she
manages to survive all that,

she'll enjoy the privilege
of growing old and dying anyway.

But, hey, don't worry. I mean,
if she's been real, real good,

she'll end up in the Elysian Fields
where she'll spend eternity...

in a state of perpetual
boredom and ignorance.

So please, lead the way.

He's practicing for a play.

Forget I said anything!

Already did.

Hah!

Just give us an excuse,
girlie.

If you say so.

Huh?

He definitely was
a cut above.

Who are you?
A fan.

I see great potential in you,
Arciana.

I want to do what I can
to nurture your talent.

Well, I'm not real good at paying
back favors, so don't do me any.

Oh. But what if I told you
where the Sword of Hera was?

I'd say start talking.

I like you. Really, I do.

The sword is in Hylea,
west of here.

Like I said,
don't expect anything in return.

Just put the sword to good use.
I'll do the rest.


?? Grace to our father??

?? Grace to our king??

?? His is the glory??

?? Wisdom shall reign??

?? We know his truth??

?? And his goodness??

?? And his mercy??

?? Is the way??

?? And the Lord of Hosts????


[All Gasp]
Music to my ears.

You really got 'em whipped into
shape, don't you? May I help you?

Oh, that depends.

You remember a little girl you
took into your orphanage, oh,

some 19 winters ago?

Her name was Arciana.

Indeed, I remember.
She was trouble.

She ran away.
Ran away.

Hm. It wouldn't have
anything to do with this...

this strap you keep
on your belt, would it?

Sometimes discipline's the only
way to communicate with children.

[Scattered Gasps]

[Strap Cracks]
Ah!

And I'm sure you get your point
across to them, don't you?

Now I'll make mine.
[Grunting]

Get out.

[Scattered Gasps, Whimpers]

Now, let me show you what it
looks like where I come from. Huh!

Aah! Aah!


Fire!

Fire!

The headmaster's trapped
in the orphanage!

Fire!

Herc, someone's dying in there!
Herc? Herc? Hercules, come on!

[Laughing]
Come on!

[Whooping]
Come on!

Hurry! Bring some water!

Thank you.

Thank you both.
Thank you.

You're welcome.
Xerxos went west.

Thanks to you. I know
you didn't mean that.

How do you know
what I mean?

Just go.

I'll deal with
Xerxos myself.

I can't do that, Hercules.

Leave me alone!

Please.

Go.

Oh!

Did you see him?


Huh!
Poor Hercules.

Did I forget to mention that the powers
I gave you have certain side effects?

I knew what I was getting into.
But you thought you'd have more control, didn't you?

Don't fight it. Lose control.
You'll feel so much better.

Are you enjoying yourself?
Not yet, but I take a while.

Why are you doing this? Is it so hard
to believe that I'd be attracted to you?

Hmm, for a legendary hero, your
self-esteem is remarkably low, you know.

You're trying
to slow me down.

Thanks. I'll bring him back.
Come on! Come on, boy!

Come on. Hah! Come on! Hyah!
Come on! [Horse Whinnies]

Xerxos. Come on! Yah! Come on!

Oh! Perhaps you shouldn't
have been so quick to split up.

But then again, what choice
did you have? Damn you!

It's a little late for that.


I don't know what you think you're doing.
You're as much a threat to him as Xerxos is.

Uh!
Where is the sword?

Huh?

I know it's here.

If you know where it is,
you don't need us.

Hmm. How right you are.

Eh!
Uh!

Time to do some real damage.

You might wanna think twice
before you do.

Hmm. My first victim.

Look, I don't have time
to explain.

Believe me when I tell you
someone is after you.

I think I can handle a few prison guards.
But, gee, thanks for your concern.

I'm talking about someone a lot more dangerous.
Oh.

You must be talking about me.

Thanks for caring.


Uh! Uh!

Okay, I'm giving you
to the count of three to let go!

Hmm. Now here's an interesting
turn of events.

Big brother leaves
little sister to die.

Little sister grows up
hating him for it.

But then, with each passing day,
she becomes more and more like him.

No.

But... you're dead.

I'm beyond dead.

[Roaring]
Aah! Aah!

[Men Groaning]

Xerxos!

[Growls]
[Grunts]

Uh! Hercules, no!

[Sword Swishes]
Get out of my way!

No! This is exactly
what Serena wants.

If you give into your hatred, you're
gonna lose whatever is left of you!

Lolaus,

if you don't move,
I will kill you.

Then I will kill you
before I see you damn your soul.


Hercules, I know
you're in there. Uh!


[Grunts]
[Screaming]

Don't you touch me!

It's like old times, huh?

Let go of me!


You don't have to like me.

You just have to listen.


What are you? Something
you don't have to become.

You still have a choice. Don't
you talk to me about choice!

You bastard! You took
mine away a long time ago!

I wish I'd died that day.
But you didn't!

I died.
It's not in you, Arciana.

Your heart is not black.
It's just broken.

That's my burden to carry,
not yours.

asking me for sympathy?

I'm telling you...
you're looking evil in the eye.

The only difference between us
is you can turn back.

I don't know if you came here out
of guilt or just plain stupidity,

but it's just a little too late to
start offering up some brotherly advice!

Since my words don't seem to
be making an impression on you,

let me show you
something that will.

Aah!

[Whip Cracking]

[Souls Wailing]

Uhhh!

Don't go down
the same road I did.

You won't like where it leads you.
[Whimpers]

Oh, I am so sorry...

to break up the family reunion, Xerxos,
but it's time for you to go back home!

I've got news for you. I'm
taking you with me. [Roars, Yells]


Come on! Come on!

Going down!


is fun, isn't it? Wait.

Whoa-a-a!

Huh?
Come here!

[Growls, Barks]
[Laughing]

Die!

[Bones Cracking]

Come on!

[Roars]
[Yells]


Ooh!
Why don't you fight me?

[Agonized Scream]

Had enough?
[Wheezes]

Apparently not.

Friend of yours?

Well, let's go say hello.
Heh-heh!

Hercules! No.

Kill 'em! Kill them all!

Kill them all!

Kill them all!



You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

This is a trap. Xerxos didn't
escape. You let him out.

I'm not killing anyone.

But you want to,
don't you?

There's anger in your heart,
Hercules.

One day... it'll win.

I don't think so.


We'll meet again,
you and I.

No, we won't.

Well, at least
I still have you.


I'll be watching you,
Hercules.

[Smacks Kiss]


Sometimes people
can surprise you.

Sometimes we can
surprise ourselves.

You sure you're
gonna be all right?

You're not taking me
back to prison?

I think you've been
punished enough.

Thank you.
Thank you both.

Take care.

Lolaus, I don't... [Sighs] know
what to say, other than I'm...

sorry I threatened to
kill you. Oh, that's okay.

I actually tried
to kill you.

Hm! Yeah! [Chuckles]
That's right. You did.

Huh! Man, you were so ugly
when you were possessed.

I was? Oh, yeah. Horns and
all those things in your face.

I mean, ugh! You don't do
possession very well.

Hey, you didn't look too hot
when you were possessed either.

Yeah, but I was dead.
Oh, yeah.

Counts for a lot.
Yeah.
