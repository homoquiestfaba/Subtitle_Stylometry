<i>(young man)</i>
<i>I would say</i>
<i>each of them</i>

<i>had their own motives</i>
<i>for doing it.</i>

<i>And I didn't put them</i>
<i>under a spell or slip</i>
<i>G H B into their Red Bull.</i>

Put your shoulders back.

<i>I n fact, a lot</i>
<i>of them came to me</i>

<i>after they saw</i>
<i>the shots I did.</i>

<i>That's great</i>
<i>right there.</i>

<i>(man)</i>
<i>So they were so blown away</i>
<i>by your photography</i>

<i>that they came to you</i>
<i>and they begged you to</i>
<i>photograph them in the buff</i>

and then post
their pictures
on the Net?

It's not a porn thing
like you're making it
out to be.

<i>Did you have sex</i>
<i>with these girls?</i>

There were rules.

<i>Rules?</i>
<i>Really?</i>

<i>I would never shoot</i>
<i>the same girl twice.</i>

<i>I would never post</i>
<i>anything that would</i>
<i>reveal their faces.</i>

<i>These were simple rules</i>
<i>that I came up with</i>

<i>so I wouldn't end up</i>
<i>in a situation like this.</i>

<i>The most important</i>
<i>rule was no sex.</i>
<i>J ust pictures.</i>

We found ten girls
on the site. Does that
sound about right?

Honey Delight.
Ruby Satin.

Sherry-licious.

Where'd you get
these names?

Lipsticks.

Your favorite shade?

<i>So, since we can't</i>
<i>see their faces,</i>

why don't you just
tell us who they
really are?

Their names were
gonna remain
out of this.

How many of them
were underage again?

<i>None of them</i>
<i>are underage.</i>

They're all
in my year.

Can you prove that?

Stop, stop.

<i>Are you gonna</i>
<i>charge him with</i>
<i>the crime or not?</i>

I'm trying
to work that out.

What is there to work out?
No one has leveled a
charge against Jordan.

<i>No one's come forward</i>
<i>to admit that they're</i>
<i>on the site.</i>

<i>So, the only thing</i>
<i>you're gonna</i>
<i>accomplish</i>

by letting this out
of closed doors, is to
tarnish Xavier's reputation.

And not to mention
your family's
good name.

I'm sure the press'll
love it, but it's not in
the best interest of Xavier.

Dean M ullen, it's your call.
If you want me to
pursue this, I will.

I don't think that'll
be necessary, Detective.

Jordan. I think I speak
for both your parents
and myself

<i>when I say that you have</i>
<i>placed us in an extremely</i>
<i>precarious position.</i>

<i>Your father has</i>
<i>rendered invaluable</i>
<i>counsel service</i>

<i>to this school</i>
<i>over the years,</i>

<i>not to mention</i>
<i>our personal friendship.</i>

<i>And even so, after speaking</i>
<i>to the headmaster</i>
<i>and the trusties,</i>

<i>the only solution</i>
<i>we can come up with</i>
<i>is expulsion.</i>

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Deep down</i>
<i>I didn't care</i>

<i>that the pictures</i>
<i>got me kicked out.</i>

<i>Or that they</i>
<i>landed me here.</i>
<i>Edgerton High.</i>

<i>Three miles from Xavier,</i>
<i>but it felt more</i>
<i>like a million.</i>

<i>My name is Jordan Wells.</i>

<i>A marketer's report</i>
<i>on me would read</i>
<i>something like this.</i>

<i>Rich, privileged.</i>

<i>Future doctor.</i>
<i>Future lawyer.</i>

<i>Future somebody.</i>

<i>It would be accurate</i>
<i>but incomplete.</i>

<i>It probably wouldn't</i>
<i>include confused,</i>
<i>indecisive,</i>

<i>lacks confidence.</i>

<i>Kids like me,</i>
<i>our lives don't</i>
<i>happen by accident.</i>

<i>They're scripted</i>
<i>very tightly.</i>

<i>At Edgerton,</i>

<i>I thought I could</i>
<i>loosen things</i>
<i>up a bit.</i>

<i>[School bell rings]</i>

<i>The record will show that</i>
<i>I started my new school</i>
<i>on September 23rd.</i>

<i>I enrolled in some</i>
<i>AP classes.</i>

<i>Joined the photo club.</i>

<i>Figured I'd just fly</i>
<i>under the radar</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

<i>Write my own story.</i>

<i>(M r. Wells)</i>
<i>Jordan, Jordan.</i>

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Of course my dad had</i>
<i>a few ideas of his own.</i>

M hmm.

Look at this.

<i>Yeah, alright.</i>
<i>Keep me posted</i>

<i>because I wanna close</i>
<i>by next week.</i>

<i>Alright.</i>
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

What do you think?

It's an art school
for troubled kids?

<i>M hmm.</i>

Whose funding is
on the chopping block.

I'm considering chairing
their foundation.

<i>I was thinking you</i>
<i>and I could co-chair.</i>

I don't really know
anything about charing
a foundation, Dad.

<i>So what?</i>

Jordan.

Getting decent grades
in chem lab and
world studies

might move your resume
to the top of the stack

if you're looking
to make a career
at some coffee bar,

<i>but if you aspire</i>
<i>to greater heights,</i>
<i>Jordan,</i>

then you gotta distinguish
yourself from the pack.

Fine.

Fine.

Your friend Desiree chaired
the Chocolate Ball at
the club last winter.

<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>give her a call?</i>
<i>Maybe she could help us.</i>

I'll think
about it.

I wanna make sure
it's worth my time.

How could it not be?
We're talking about
saving an art school

for city kids.
Come on.

It's not the kids!
If I'm gonna be
putting in the hours,

<i>I wanna make sure</i>
<i>you're really</i>
<i>in with this.</i>

<i>I'm a busy girl.</i>

Are you still
at your dad's office?

Yeah. I'm officially a
New Visions J ustice
Professional.

Which is what?
A glorified name

for someone who
delivers coffee to
the assistant D As?

Ha!
Lunches, too.

Yeah. And I
pick up their laundry.

There's a lot of aspects
to fighting crime.

Which brings us
back to you.

How did Ben
talk you into this?

This?

Yeah, this.
Art project,
museum kids.

I bet your sabotage effort
really knocked him
on his ass.

And don't bother
telling me that's
not what it was.

I know you.
Sometimes even better
than you know yourself.

Then, I bet you know
the answer, Des.

Jordan, they just want
what's best for you.
Is that so bad?

I guess not.

You get that
shot, bitch?

<i>[Crowd cheers]</i>

<i>[Cheerleaders singing]</i>

<i>[Loud cheering of crowd]</i>

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>If you were at</i>
<i>the game that night,</i>

<i>you would've</i>
<i>noticed her, too.</i>

<i>We all have ways</i>
<i>of showing our defiance.</i>

<i>She flashed hers</i>
<i>like a roadside</i>
<i>attraction.</i>

<i>Daring you to drive by</i>
<i>without taking a look.</i>

<i>Of course I wanted</i>
<i>to shoot her the</i>
<i>moment I saw her.</i>

<i>She had everything</i>
<i>I looked for</i>
<i>in a subject.</i>

<i>Loneliness.</i>

<i>Mystery.</i>

You guys
look miserable.

Okay? Yearbook's
for a lifetime.
Let's smile.

<i>A lot of kids hide</i>
<i>who they really are.</i>

<i>They become masters</i>
<i>at doing it.</i>

<i>Behind perfect G PAs.</i>

<i>Behind fixed smiles.</i>

<i>Designer clothes.</i>

<i>The kids they</i>
<i>hang out with.</i>

<i>Some have been hiding</i>
<i>so long, they don't know</i>
<i>who they are anymore.</i>

<i>That's what I've tried</i>
<i>to find with my camera.</i>

<i>Who they really are.</i>

[Indistinct conversation]

<i>Any recommendation</i>
<i>on a good read?</i>

<i>By a woman,</i>
<i>about a woman,</i>

but required
reading for men.

<i>The A wakening.</i>
H m.

Doesn't this end with
a suicidal drowning?

<i>It's like the ultimate</i>
<i>form of sleeping.</i>

It's kind of a contrast,
wouldn't you say?

Edna awakened to the fact
that in her society she was
nothing more than chattel.

And her mentor,
Mademoiselle Reisz,
taught her

that the artist must posses
a courageous soul which
dares and defies.

She felt like the only way
she could courageously act
in such a society

was to refuse
to live in it,
to defy it by death.

That's a very
fair assessment.

But wouldn't you say
the ending's weak?

You'd do it
differently?

<i>Sure. I'd fake</i>
<i>my own death.</i>

Set up a shop in some
tropical island.

You'd run away.

<i>I would live to fight</i>
<i>another day.</i>

And paint many,
many more.

<i>(Trish)</i>
<i>We're out.</i>
<i>Shay, you coming?</i>

No, I think
I'm gonna stay
and finish this.

<i>Whatever.</i>

What's your name?

Jordan Wells.

Shay Bettencourt.

What are you doing
after school today?

Do you have
a car?

It's right here.

Thanks.

Thanks?

That's all I get?
Thought we were
going get to hang out.

I'm sorry.
I have work.

Can you get someone
to cover your shift?

My boss doesn't like it
when we do that.

Where's that?

Oak Valley.

<i>The country club?</i>
<i>My father's</i>
<i>a member.</i>

I've done your brunches.
It's not really my scene.

You don't like
the food?

I don't like
the cigar smoke.

Guess you haven't
been in a while.

There's a new
no smoking policy
in the main dining room.

It's not the smoke
that bothers me.

Thanks for the ride.

<i>(Desiree)</i>
<i>Good afternoon</i>
<i>and welcome to MoKA.</i>

<i>This is some</i>
<i>useful information</i>

<i>you guys are gonna</i>
<i>need tomorrow for</i>
<i>the press release.</i>

You're welcome.
Here you go.

Thank you, dear.

<i>Okay. Well,</i>
<i>let's begin.</i>

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Desiree Thomas.</i>

<i>She fit perfectly</i>
<i>in the scripted world.</i>

<i>Did everything</i>
<i>with a natural grace.</i>

<i>Comfortable</i>
<i>wherever she was.</i>

<i>Effortless.</i>

<i>Seems everything I did</i>
<i>was calculated to get me</i>
<i>somewhere else.</i>

<i>Took me twice as</i>
<i>much energy for</i>
<i>half the result.</i>

<i>We dated a few times</i>
<i>but there was</i>
<i>no mystery.</i>

<i>A good relationship</i>
<i>needs mystery.</i>

<i>[Ding-dong]</i>

Yes?

H i. Is Shay home?

I'm sorry?

Shay? We go
to Edgerton together.

I think you have
the wrong house.

Is this
the Bettencourts?

No.

I dropped
my lipstick.

I noticed.

<i>Aren't you</i>
<i>gonna ask?</i>

What?
Your real address?

<i>Nice fake.</i>
<i>You trying to</i>
<i>throw me off balance?</i>

<i>No, not really.</i>
<i>I just didn't wanna</i>
<i>tell you where I live.</i>

Why is that?

Because it's not
Ambassador Heights.

I'm sorry.

<i>You think I'm so shallow</i>
<i>that I would judge you</i>
<i>by where you live?</i>

We can talk about
my class inferiority
complex later.

Wouldn't you prefer
to discuss my
favorite shade?

I asked around.

I heard all about you
and your little
lipstick fetish.

You wanna add me
to your collection.

Oh, come on.

Those other ones
were like

homework assignments.

And I'm like
the final exam?

<i>Yeah. And that's</i>
<i>a good thing</i>

'cause I always
ace my finals.

So what exactly
do I get if you
"ace" me?

Some unbelievable
pictures of yourself?

Yeah, but those
are for you.

<i>I guess I'm just</i>
<i>cashed out then, huh?</i>

Maybe not.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>She learned the cello</i>
<i>taking night classes</i>

<i>at Rutherford</i>
<i>M usic School.</i>

<i>Her mom's idea.</i>

<i>Thought it would add</i>
<i>a little refinement</i>

<i>to an otherwise</i>
<i>shaky upbringing.</i>

<i>She told me her mom</i>
<i>died a few years back.</i>

<i>Now she lived</i>
<i>with her sister,</i>

<i>who wasn't around</i>
<i>very much.</i>

How's this?

I'll let you shoot a
roll of pictures of me

if you take some
pictures for me first.

I'm sorry.

I'm kind of slow
on the uptake here.
Can you...

Can you translate
that for me?

I'm in a bit
of a situation.

A situation?

Relationship.

<i>Somebody at school?</i>

It's complicated.

How so?

He is... older.

<i>Married.</i>

No, not married.
Not anymore.

But let's just say in his
position he shouldn't be
hooking up with me.

And what position
is that?

That would be in fact
that I'm still in
high school.

<i>Okay.</i>
<i>I'm listening.</i>

I'm not exactly sure
where things are
going right now,

<i>but it seems</i>
<i>to be getting</i>
<i>out of control.</i>

<i>How does my camera</i>
<i>fit in to all this?</i>

I'd like you
to follow us.

<i>Capture a few moments,</i>
<i>if you know</i>
<i>what I mean.</i>

<i>J ust in case</i>
<i>something happens.</i>

My advice,
you should
call a cop.

He made me a promise
and I need to make sure
that he keeps it.

<i>So I take pictures</i>
<i>for you</i>

and you let me take
pictures of you?

Exactly.

I don't know
if I'm the right
person for this.

I've got my
own problems
at the moment.

Okay.
There's the door.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>It seemed like</i>
<i>a reasonable deal.</i>

<i>Pictures for pictures.</i>

<i>But the more I shot</i>

<i>the more intrigued</i>
<i>I was by her.</i>

<i>And it made me realize</i>
<i>how bored I'd been.</i>

<i>Every picture I took</i>
<i>peeled away</i>
<i>another layer.</i>

<i>And every time</i>
<i>I peeled one away,</i>

<i>it seemed like</i>
<i>I discovered</i>
<i>two more.</i>

<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in a while</i>

<i>I felt excited</i>
<i>by a challenge.</i>

<i>(Shay)</i>
<i>His name's</i>
<i>Wade Chandling.</i>

<i>His a member</i>
<i>at Oak Valley</i>

<i>and a parter</i>
<i>in a law firm</i>
<i>downtown.</i>

We had a recital last
winter at Rutherford

for supporting patrons
and he was there.

And, um,
he came
up to me

and said he
remembered me
from the club.

And he liked
how I played.

And he promised
to help me get into
this program at Hartley.

A performance scholarship
awarded to four students
every year.

Full ride.
All expenses.

Do you know
what Hartley means?

That's one of the best
music schools
in the country.

It means
freedom, Jordan.

Not being trapped.
Not having my
options limited.

The fast lane into
any philharmonic
in the world.

And he's just going
to set you up?

He has some friends
on the advisory committee.

H uh.

So, this beautiful
young cellist

<i>who, uh, basically</i>
<i>lives on her own,</i>

<i>he takes this</i>
<i>young artist</i>
<i>under his wing.</i>

It wasn't like that.

<i>It just slowly</i>
<i>developed into more.</i>

<i>And how many</i>
<i>other musicians</i>
<i>is he helping?</i>

<i>Any overweight</i>
<i>tuba players</i>

with club feet
and bad cases
of acne?

You don't do jealous well.
Has anyone ever
told you that?

It feels
very natural.

I'm glad you think
you know everything.

Sorry. You're the one
who's having me
take the pictures.

Clearly you're
having doubts.

Can I see
the pictures?

Thanks.

Good.

Okay. So, your place
after school?

Better make it yours.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>It's been said</i>

<i>a good photographer</i>
<i>captures the subject.</i>

<i>But a good subject</i>
<i>captures the photographer.</i>

<i>She had me.</i>

<i>There was no doubt</i>
<i>about it.</i>

<i>She wasn't like</i>
<i>the Xavier girls.</i>

<i>But that's what</i>
<i>drew me to her.</i>

Sit down.

<i>Play.</i>
<i>Play Bach.</i>

Look at me.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Her face</i>
<i>spoke volumes.</i>

<i>I became</i>
<i>addicted to her.</i>

<i>Her haunted eyes</i>

<i>challenged me.</i>

<i>It's a strange</i>
<i>thing that happens</i>

<i>when an artist</i>
<i>and a subject click.</i>

<i>A synergy</i>
<i>is created.</i>

<i>Each senses that</i>
<i>they're playing</i>
<i>a role</i>

<i>in something that's</i>
<i>very powerful.</i>

<i>But it's unspoken.</i>

<i>Say that out loud</i>
<i>and you might kill it.</i>

Hey!

You wanna shoot
some more?

Absolutely.

Meet me at my place
after school.

<i>[Indistinct conversation]</i>

<i>(Jordan to Shay)</i>
<i>I could take your</i>
<i>picture every day.</i>

How about this
right here?

<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

Wanna change roles?

No, I've got
one more shot.

Cute.

What's it
gonna be?

You're out of film.

I know.

<i>(woman)</i>
<i>What is this shit?</i>

T?

Why aren't you
answering your cell?

T, this is Jordan,
from school. Jordan,
this is my sister, Tarra.

You should answer your cell.
I've been calling you
since yesterday.

<i>I haven't got any calls</i>
<i>form you. Are you dialing</i>
<i>the right number?</i>

What the fuck
are you trying
to say?

You should go now.

Are going
to be okay?

<i>(Tarra)</i>
<i>Shay, where</i>
<i>the fuck is it?</i>

Where is what,
Tarra?

<i>You fucking</i>
<i>know what I</i>

<i>Tarra, you have</i>
<i>to be more specific.</i>

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Picasso once said that</i>
<i>every child is an artist.</i>

But that the secret
is to remain one
once you grow up.

<i>The M useum of Kids Art,</i>
<i>the reason why you're</i>
<i>all here today,</i>

helps artistically
inclined children
do just that.

But MoKA's
good intentions

<i>will remain,</i>
<i>uh, intentions.</i>

<i>Without commitment,</i>
<i>without action,</i>

without a few
checkbooks
behind them.


<i>We started this foundation</i>
<i>to let MoKA know</i>

that they do not stand
alone in their efforts.

That there are a number
of other people that
will support them.

<i>(Ben)</i>
<i>And he told me that if</i>
<i>you get me $ 10 million,</i>

<i>I can retire.</i>
<i>And I never heard</i>
<i>from him again.</i>

Jordan!

Someone I want you
to meet. This is
Wade Chandling.

<i>M r. Chandler is a</i>
<i>bankruptcy lawyer.</i>
<i>He's got a firm downtown.</i>

Hopefully you'll never
need our services.

<i>You're cleaning up</i>
<i>that High Falls mess.</i>

Yeah, if I can get
the federal auditors
off my ass.

<i>After what happened</i>
<i>in Albany, those guys</i>
<i>are gonna peel back</i>

<i>every state-funded</i>
<i>urban renewal project.</i>

<i>It's a dead end.</i>
<i>They're never gonna</i>
<i>find anything on my guy.</i>

I liked your speech.

Thank you.

Listen, if you ever need
anything for your foundation,
just give me a call.

I will.

Jesus, Jordan.
What are you doing?

I'm abducting you.
If you scream, I'll be
forced to cover your mouth.

No, Jordan.
I didn't know he
was gonna be here.

What if he
catches us?

Let him.

What did you guys
talk about?

Some pictures
that I was gonna
show him.

Very funny.

I gotta go.
I gotta go!

Kiss me.

I gotta go.

Shay.
Shay!

<i># Tell me</i>
<i># Tell me true #</i>

<i>With the spirit #</i>

<i># The way I do #</i>

<i># Do you dance</i>
<i>The dance #</i>

<i># The hands on you #</i>
<i># Do you sleep at night #</i>

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Alright. Look</i>

<i>Perfect.</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>

<i># I make a mistake #</i>

<i># Forgive me now</i>

Magenta Madness.

No.

Cotton Candy?

No.

Crimson Red.

No!

You're not
gonna tell me?

Not until you tell me
something first.

Okay.
What?

I don't know.
Anything.

Something no one else
in the world knows
except you.

You scare me.

I already knew that.
I said tell me something
that anyone knows.

You scare me
and I like it.

You're such
a charmer.

Oh, yeah?

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Her favorite shade</i>
<i>was Cherry Crush.</i>

<i>It fit so perfectly</i>
<i>that I didn't know whether</i>
<i>to believe her or not.</i>

<i>One thing I did know.</i>

<i>There was something</i>
<i>different about her.</i>

I love you.

Have a good time.

<i>She felt like</i>
<i>something I needed.</i>

<i>More than I wanted.</i>

<i>That maybe I was</i>
<i>crossing some line</i>
<i>without realizing it.</i>

That uniform would look
great on the deck
next to my hot tub.

Jordan Wells.

M r. Chandling.

Call me Wade.
What are you drinking?

A Coke.

Ooh, boy.
Bring this man
a Coke, Gary.

That speech you made
really impressed me.

Thanks.

Thanks, Gary.

Funny thing is,

watching you
that day

really reminded me
of myself at your age.

How is that?

H igh-powered father.

Gives you a lot,
but nothing without
strings attached.

Am I close?

Gotta give your father
some credit, though.

He must have
a lot of control.

After that
Xavier business.

Can't keep a secret
too long in the age
of information, can you?

Charing the foundation,
your father's idea?

Yeah.

Got your eye
on Cornell?

That's the plan.

Look,

very few kids
grow up wanting
to be lawyers.

I mean, growing up
you wanna be
a ball player,

an astronaut,
a rock star.

Not a lawyer.

Do you think I
grew up wanting to be
a bankruptcy attorney?

Fuck, no!

You know what
lawyers are, Jordan?

Lawyers are translators.

Translating the language
of the land.

What is the language
of the land?

Money.

Money. Fuck, yeah.
You got that right.

The question is,

are you gonna speak
the language of the land

or are you going
to have it spoken
to you?

Freud had it right.

Two most important
things in this life.

Your work,
your sex.

Don't need to make it
complicated, Jordan.

J ust don't let anyone
fuck with your money

or your pussy.

Drink your Coke.

I was so nervous
watching you two.

He's fearless.

I mean, he's the kind
of guy that just drives
through red lights

to let the world
know they can't
fuck with them.

You know how they
catch monkeys in
southeast Asia?

No, I do not know how
they catch monkeys
in southeast Asia.

Would you like
to know?

With a basket.

They cut a little
hole in the basket

that's just big enough
for the monkey to put
his hand into.

Then they put
fruit in it.

So, when the monkey
puts his hand in and
he grabs the fruit,

his closed fist is
too big to fit back
through the hole.

So, instead of just
letting the fruit go
and running free,

he just waits until
the trappers come.

<i>Is that true?</i>

<i>Sucks for the monkey.</i>

It's kinda like
most guys I know.

Once they get a taste
of it, they just can't
help themselves.

Even though logic
is telling them
to just back off,

they can't.

They just
keep coming
back for more.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Her life wasn't easy.</i>

<i>That much I was</i>
<i>certain of.</i>

<i>There was something</i>
<i>tragic and sad just</i>
<i>under her skin.</i>

<i>A feeling which</i>
<i>she had limited time.</i>

<i>[Telephone rings]</i>

<i>And that at any moment</i>
<i>her world might cave in.</i>

[Phone rings]

Hey.

<i>(Shay)</i>
<i>Jordan?</i>

What's wrong?

<i>I need to see you.</i>

I called Hartley.

They said the letters
went out two weeks ago.

Did you call him?

I'm gonna show him
the pictures, Jordan.

What?

Shay!

You gotta think
this through.

No. Fuck him!
He's not getting
away with this shit.

Fuck him! Treating me
like I'm some fucking
Barbie doll

like he can just
play with whenever
he wants to?

Fuck that!
I'm gonna take
these to the cops.

<i>I'm gonna show his</i>
<i>friends, a lawyer,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>I'm gonna show somebody</i>
<i>'cause someone's gonna</i>
<i>fucking listen to me.</i>

<i>Shay, I don't think</i>
<i>that's such a good idea.</i>

It's too late.

We're meeting
by the glen tonight.

I can't let you
do that.

It's not up
to you, Jordan.

I'm involved in this.

You made me
a part of this, Shay.

<i>Oh, I did?</i>
<i>I did? I'm sorry.</i>

You're excused.
How about that.
Is that better for you?

One way or another
he's gonna help me
get into this program.

Without a scholarship?

You think he's just
gonna snap his fingers?

<i>J ust wave</i>
<i>a magic wand?</i>

No, they want me.
I know that
they want me.

I just need the money.
And he's got the money.

Trust me.
He's got the money.

<i>Did you know that</i>
<i>he's been under</i>
<i>investigation?</i>

Have you seen these?

<i>Yes.</i>
<i>And they haven't</i>
<i>found anything.</i>

There was a metal box
bolted to the floor in
his bedroom closet.

It's not really a safe,
but one of those
fireproof things

that you put
really important
documents in.

I was at his place once
and I could've sworn I
saw Wade put cash into it.

A lot of cash.


<i>What?</i>

Say it!
Tell me what
you're thinking.

<i>Tell me how naive I am.</i>
<i>Tell me I'm really</i>
<i>fucking stupid</i>

for thinking that he
might actually
care about me.

<i>I think you should</i>
<i>forget about him.</i>
<i>You should let it go.</i>

That's easy for
you to say, right?
Easy for you to say

'cause you can hop back
under your cozy silk covers
whenever you need to.

It doesn't work
like that for me.

<i>The world doesn't work</i>
<i>like that, okay?</i>

I needed this!
I really needed it!

<i>[Cell phone rings]</i>

Are you okay?

<i>(Shay)</i>
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to hear you.</i>

We should come up
with a signal
or something.

<i>For?</i>

I n case you have the
feeling something
bad is happening.

<i>I'll deal with it.</i>

J ust open up the door
and get out of the car.

<i>Okay. And then what?</i>

And then I'll come
and save you.

<i>Jordan?</i>

Yeah.

<i>I'm gad you're here.</i>

Right now.
Get off.

Shay!

What the hell happened?
I've been waiting
for an hour!

<i>We were supposed</i>
<i>to meet about the</i>
<i>charity auction.</i>

<i>You totally</i>
<i>blew me offl</i>

Jesus, what...

What happened
to you?

I'm okay.

Okay?
No, you're not...

I'm okay, please.

Jordan, look at you.
You're not okay.
What happened?

I've been waiting
here an hour

and you're not gonna
give me the courtesy
of an explanation?

I'm sorry.

Whatever.

<i>[Starts engine]</i>

J ust take it easy.

You're fucking in
on this with her?

What?

You trying to take
my fucking money!

<i>You wanna take</i>
<i>my fucking money?</i>

<i>I don't think you and I</i>
<i>should be seen together</i>
<i>for a few days.</i>

<i>Okay?</i>

Yeah.

Where are
Wade's keys?

<i>I've got them.</i>

Let me see.

One of these keys
unlocks the box.

I know Wade's
security code.

He left me the key
that time I was there.

<i>Look, I think</i>
<i>the only thing</i>
<i>you and I</i>

should be focused
on right now

is how to keep us
breathing free air

<i>for the rest</i>
<i>of our lives.</i>

<i>[Aircraft engines roaring]</i>

<i>[Indistinct conversation]</i>

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>I've replayed it a</i>
<i>thousand times in my mind,</i>

<i>frame by frame.</i>

<i>And come up with</i>
<i>a thousand things we</i>
<i>should've done differently.</i>

<i>But life doesn't</i>
<i>give you the chance</i>
<i>to go back and edit.</i>

<i>Should we have</i>
<i>come clean?</i>

<i>Call the cops,</i>
<i>call my dad,</i>

<i>pleaded self-defense?</i>

<i>Or should we have</i>
<i>been more drastic?</i>

<i>Driven his body</i>
<i>hundreds of miles away?</i>

<i>Dropped into a river or</i>
<i>somewhere and hoped</i>
<i>we weren't seen?</i>

<i>A thousand things</i>
<i>we should've done</i>
<i>differently.</i>

<i>But all we're left with</i>
<i>is what we did.</i>

<i>(reporter)</i>
<i>His assistant</i>
<i>became concerned</i>

<i>when no one heard</i>
<i>from him Tuesday morning.</i>

<i>Police searched for signs</i>
<i>of Chandling in places</i>
<i>he frequented,</i>

<i>but found</i>
<i>no traces of him.</i>

<i>Early this morning his body</i>
<i>was discovered in the woods</i>
<i>near Corbetts Glen.</i>

<i>Sarah Cowen</i>
<i>is at the scene.</i>

They found Wade
Chandling's body
in the park.

<i>Attorney Wade Chandling</i>
<i>was discovered early</i>
<i>this morning by hikers.</i>

Really?

<i>He'd been missing</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

<i>A hiker found him</i>
<i>near the glen</i>
<i>beaten to death.</i>

<i>I'm Sarah Cowen.</i>
<i>Channel Six news.</i>

<i>(woman teacher)</i>
<i>That's mezzo forte in the</i>
<i>second measure, Elena.</i>

Help you?

Shay's not here.

She didn't show up
to practice today.

Elena, please,
listen.

Is she sick?

The office said
there was no call.

Thanks.

Is Shay home?

No, she's not home.

D'you know
where she is?

No, I thought
you might know
where she is.

Gordie, right?

Gordon?

Jordan.

What do you want
with her anyway?

Nothing.

We were just...
We were gonna
meet up later.

<i>[Calling by cell phone]</i>

<i>Hey, this is Shay.</i>

<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>after the beep and</i>
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

Shay, it's Jordan.
I know I keep calling.

I'm just trying
to track you down.

I'm on my cell.
If you can call me.

<i>(Desiree)</i>
<i>So the, uh,</i>

donations that we got
for the action are
several paintings

and drawings from
Elliot Damien, Gary
Fine, Robert Walker.

<i>And they're all estimated</i>
<i>over a quarter of</i>
<i>a million dollars.</i>

<i>We got very lucky I</i>

Jordan.

Put the phone away.

What's up?

What do you mean?

You didn't say
two words in there.

There was not much
to say. Desiree's
got a handle on it.

Who's co-charing this
with me, you or her?

Besides, last I heard
Desiree's already been
accepted to Yale for the fall.

I swear, Jordan, sometimes
I just wanna shake you out
of your complacency.

You do your homework
before the next meeting.

If you sit there
with your thumb
up your ass again,

I'm gonna break it off
and leave it there
permanently.

Put the phone away.

Remember me?
Detective Griffin?

We met when you had
that little problem
at Xavier.

Yeah.

D'you take these?

Yes.

<i>Not bad.</i>

<i>You're a regular</i>
<i>Andy Warhol, huh?</i>

No, not really.

He was more
of a painter.

You know, you're just
the guy I wanna see.

I'm thinking
about getting
a digital camera.

Any suggestions?
All that mega
pixel stuff

makes my head spin.

How much you
looking to spend?

Not a lot.

Well, I'll give it
some thought.

I understand you're
a friend of Shay
Bettencourt's.

Yeah, that's right.

Any idea
where she is?

She's been out
the last few days.

You know, I think
she's sick.

I don't think so.

<i>I checked her place.</i>
<i>She's not there.</i>

<i>You and Shay</i>
<i>pretty tight?</i>

We hang out, yeah.

Does she like having
her picture taken?

What's this about?

<i>How much did</i>
<i>you really know</i>
<i>about her?</i>

What do you mean?

You know about
her mom, right?

Yeah.
That she's dead.

Who told you that?

Shay mentioned it.

Well. No!

Her mom's alive
and well,

and living in the Attica
State Correctional
Facility for Women.

How is that?

She carved up Shay's step
dad with a steak knife a
couple of years back.

I think we're talking
about two totally
different people here.

Don't think so.
How long has she been
seeing Wade Chandling?

You know who
he is, right?

Never mentioned him.

I guess dating a guy
that's old enough
to be your dad,

that's not something
you wanna advertise.

How do you know this?

<i>Well, Wade</i>
<i>Chandling is a...</i>

was a member
of the Oak Valley
Country Club.

Same place
Shay works.

Some of the members had
a problem with their cars
being vandalized

in the past few months,
so they put a video camera
in the parking lot

to keep an eye
on things.

We got a look
at the tapes.

Lots of video of Shay
climbing into Chandling's
car after hours.

Yeah. That's a real
head-scratcher,
isn't it?

If you see Shay,

it's important
she contact me.

Take care, Warhol.

<i>(attorney)</i>
<i>My office is getting up</i>
<i>to speed on this case.</i>

<i>I've spoken to Chief Malley</i>
<i>several timer over</i>
<i>the past few hours</i>

and made it very clear
to him that he has
our full support.

I n an investigation
of this type...

This is Desiree.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>D, it's me.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

Watching my dad feed the
media a few sound bites.
What's up?

I need to see you.

Jordan Wells
asking me for a favor.
What are the odds?

Can you meet me
in an hour?

Are you gonna
stand me up again?

D, come on.

Yeah, okay.
Where?

Hey.

With soy milk?

Yeah.

H m. You must
be desperate.
Thanks.

I want to talk to you
about the other night.

And you've just gotta
trust me when I tell
you that it's okay.

And that I'm sorry.

Okay.

I wanted to get together and
thank you for everything you've
been doing for the foundation.

You're saving
my ass.

Right.

How's everything
going with you?

How's everything going
in your dad's office?

Everything's fine.

You guys must be on
this Chandling thing.

Not officially,
but you know, they're
moving kind of fast.

Do you have
any suspects?

I'm an intern, Jordan.
They don't really
tell me anything.

That's never
really stopped
you before, though.

True.

Okay. So off
the record,

it looks like they haven't
been able to pull that
much from the scene.

What do you mean?

<i>It means whoever did it,</i>
<i>covered the tracks</i>
<i>pretty well.</i>

They are hoping to catch
a break when the find
Chandling's car.

What about this whole audit
thing that everybody's
been talking about?

What about it?

If he was shuffling
around money for
some of his clients,

things could have
gone bad.

Yeah. Okay.

Okay, what's the deal?

You trade in your camera
for a pen and paper?

Does the Edgerton Bugle
have the whole staff
working on the story?

I'm interested
in what you do.
I'm trying to keep up.

Okay.
I'm gonna go.

<i>I don't really feel</i>
<i>like hanging out</i>
<i>with a stranger.</i>

<i>Especially when it's</i>
<i>a stranger I've known</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

Thanks for the <i>chai.</i>

<i>[Door closes]</i>

<i>What are you</i>
<i>doing here?</i>

I freaked out.

We talked about not
doing anything out
of the ordinary.

Do you remember that?

I'm just really
confused right now.

Where have
you been?

I went to the abandoned
house on the bluffs.

<i>H uh.</i>

I had to sort some
things out in my
head, you know.

I got a visit from
the Police today.

They know about Wade
and me, don't they?

<i>Yeah. They have security</i>
<i>cameras installed</i>
<i>in the parking lot</i>

at the country club.

So yeah,
they do.

Why didn't you tell me
about your mother?

My mother?

You know
what I mean.

Because I was
afraid, Jordan.

You made it out
like she was dead.

As far as
I'm concerned,
she is dead.

You didn't have
to hide it from me.

<i>Not that.</i>

<i>You have to go</i>
<i>in there and you</i>
<i>have to talk to them.</i>

What if they put
everything together?

<i>I just talked to my</i>
<i>friend who interns</i>
<i>in the D A 's office.</i>

They don't know
anything.

<i>What if they find</i>
<i>his car and find my</i>
<i>fingerprints inside?</i>

<i>They know you were in the car.</i>
<i>They don't know you were</i>
<i>in the car that night.</i>

<i>If you keep</i>
<i>letting this</i>
<i>hang out there,</i>

<i>they're gonna get</i>
<i>really suspicious</i>
<i>about you.</i>

And then they
could become really
suspicious about me.

What do I tell them?

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>This is amazing.</i>
<i>Amazing.</i>

I mean, in my
wildest dreams

when I first decided
to enter into this
with my father,

I did not think that
we'd get this
much support.

<i>So many of you</i>
<i>tonight have been</i>
<i>given so much.</i>

<i>Not that I'm implying</i>
<i>you haven't worked</i>
<i>for what you have,</i>

<i>but there is some money</i>
<i>in here that is so old</i>

<i>I don't think there's</i>
<i>a carbon-dating test</i>
<i>to trace its origins.</i>

<i>[Muffled laughter]</i>

What we've all
been giving.

<i>What is worth more</i>
<i>than money, though,</i>

<i>is the invaluable</i>
<i>blessings of our</i>
<i>supportive families,</i>

<i>respect for education,</i>

and belief in our
hopes and dreams.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>Shay walked into the</i>
<i>Edgerton Police Department</i>

<i>and lied her way</i>
<i>out of it.</i>

<i>Later that day I put</i>
<i>the finishing touches</i>
<i>to my own story.</i>

<i>I completed my image</i>
<i>transformation from</i>
<i>prep school bad boy</i>

<i>to a shining crusader</i>
<i>for children's art.</i>

<i>Right back into</i>
<i>the lvy League</i>
<i>and beyond.</i>

<i>(auctioneer)</i>
<i>Forty-five once.</i>
<i>Forty-five twice.</i>

<i>Sometimes it feels</i>
<i>like a charmed life,</i>
<i>doesn't it?</i>

<i>(auctioneer)</i>
<i>Sold for $4, 500.</i>

There we go.
Hey, awesome job.

Awesome job.

Thanks.

Hey.

You got a good
night tonight.

Probably made
enough to keep MoKA
running for years.

That should definitely
turn a few heads
at Cornell.

You sure know how
to throw a great
party, D.

What do you
want me to say?

I do.

It's in my blood.

The question
is, though,

is it in yours?

What does that mean?

They found Chandling's
car today.

It was parked
on the roof of
a city garage.

They're sure that
he didn't leave it there

because they found some
muddy footprints
in a size ten.

He's a 12.

The mud matches
the samples

that they took
from the woods
near the glen.

They also found
a few partial latents

that, uh, someone
didn't do a very
good job wiping off.

The Police got a tip
today, Jordan, that
a blue Audi

was parked at the glen
for a few hours the night
Chandling went missing.

Right about the same time
you and I were supposed
to get together.

You know the girl
they interviewed
today, right?

Yeah.

Jesus, Jordan!

That's what the
Chai Latte was all
about yesterday, huh?

Oh, come on, don't!

Don't you dare.

I saw you that night.
I saw the mud
all over you,

and I hoped to God
I was the only one.

You know something.
Let's go to my dad
right now!

I know that
she was involved
with Wade Chandling.

But that's...

That's really just
all I now, D.

<i>They cleared me.</i>
<i>I'm free.</i>

[Cell phone rings]

Hello?

<i>(Detective Griffin)</i>
<i>Hey, Warhol.</i>

Griffin.

<i>We gotta talk</i>
<i>you and me.</i>

I'm kind of in a little
something right now.

<i>I suggest you drop it</i>
<i>and meet me at the ball</i>
<i>field in 20 minutes.</i>

This was
my school, too.

You might not believe it
but I was kind of a
nobody back then.

During football games
I'd sit on the hill
over there

<i>by myself.</i>

<i>Observing life like</i>
<i>it was being lived</i>
<i>without me.</i>

Football players
on the field,

cheerleaders
on the sideline,

guys like you.

Wade Chandling
in the stands.

<i>Smiles on</i>
<i>their faces.</i>

<i>Not a care</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

I gotta get
to class.

Hey.

I'll write you
an excuse.

Your girl's off the hook,
did she tell you?

Yeah.

And, um,

look what landed
in my lap this morning.

You already know
what's in there.

<i>But open it</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

<i>I wanna see</i>
<i>your reaction.</i>

<i>Now, there's two ways</i>
<i>we can play this.</i>

One, I take those pictures
to a judge and get
a subpoena

<i>to check your shoe size</i>
<i>and fingerprints.</i>

Your previous history
with photography

should make that
almost a lock.

Or two,

you help me conduct
a little experiment

that just might
save your ass.

<i>I've never seen those</i>
<i>pictures before</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

<i>Right. And your A4</i>
<i>wasn't at the glen</i>
<i>the other night.</i>

I've got you, Warhol.

And the thing is,
I'm pretty sure it
wasn't your idea.

It was all hers.

You know anything
about meta-data files?

It's the most amazing
concept in digital
photography.

You store a file

with a photo
on a disk.

All sorts of juicy stuff
gets encoded in there.

Date, time,

what kind of camera,
serial number.

It's like a digital
fingerprint.

It's the nail
in your coffin

if somebody decides
to crosscheck
those files

against the number
on your camera.

A scholarship.

He was gonna help her
get a scholarship.

A scholarship?

To Hartley.

Oh, man.
That's beautiful.

All for the
advancement
of art, eh?

<i>I don't think</i>
<i>that was it, Warhol.</i>

It's just a theory
I'm working on.

I don't have it
all put together, yet.

But it involves
Chandling

and a whole
pile of money

I think your girl
was trying to get
her hands on.

And I am not talking
tuition money.

I'm talking about
something in excess
of one million bucks.

Come on.

See, I think Shay
made you think

that it was about
the music.

But really Chandling
was sitting on
something big.

And she knew it.

So she tried
to squeeze him

to get him to pay her
to keep her mouth shut.

Things went bad.

And then you came along
and helped clean up
the mess.

It was supposed to be
about a scholarship.

<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>it's only a theory.</i>

But we can test it.

I'm thinking, once
I run your prints,

they're gonna do
a whole lot of talking.

Maybe not enough to put
one of Ben Wells'
kids in Attica

for the rest
of his days,

but you think for
one second that your
life's gonna be the same?

<i>Which brings us back</i>
<i>to our little experiment.</i>

I want $1 million.

What?

One million.

I don't have that.

But she does.

And maybe you
already know
that, Warhol.

Here's my number.

I wanna hear from you
by the end of the day.

<i>Now, get the fuck</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

Jordan?

What happened
to my house?

You went back
for the keys, Shay.

<i>Why would</i>
<i>you say that?</i>

I met with that cop
Griffin earlier today.

What did he tell you?

That he found the box
in Wade's bedroom.

<i>Empty.</i>

Was this ever
about the music?

<i>Of course it wasl</i>

He's trying to get us
against each other.
Can't you see that?

I'm telling you
the truth, Jordan.

What do you want me
to do to prove that
to you?

Where's the
money, Shay?

It's not here.
I hid it someplace safe.

<i>I n a few hours,</i>
<i>Griffin is gonna</i>
<i>get a subpoena</i>

so they can check
my prints.

<i>If you wanna prove it,</i>
<i>I need that money.</i>

You pay him,
and then what?

<i>He could arrest you.</i>
<i>He could even</i>
<i>kill you I</i>

We have two options
right now.

We can either
get out of here
as fast as we can,

or we kill him.
And we're not killers.

We're not?

<i>No, we're not I</i>

I know a place where we
can go where no one
would ever find us.

And the cops
couldn't touch us.

I can't live
looking over my
shoulder, Jordan.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>I told her</i>
<i>I'd go with her.</i>

<i>But it was a lie.</i>

<i>The only place</i>
<i>I wanted to go</i>
<i>was back.</i>

<i>Back to simple.</i>

<i>Back to scripted.</i>

<i>Shay could ad-lip.</i>

<i>She could make it up</i>
<i>as she went along.</i>

<i>She'd been doing it</i>
<i>her whole life.</i>

<i>And my whole life</i>
<i>had been mapped</i>
<i>out for me.</i>

<i>I wasn't going anywhere.</i>

<i>[Cell phone rings]</i>

<i>(Griffin)</i>
<i>Griffin.</i>

You'll have it
in an hour.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>The life everyone</i>
<i>lives in their minds</i>

<i>is so much better.</i>

<i>So much more appealing</i>

<i>than the one they're</i>
<i>actually living.</i>

<i>But almost always</i>

<i>the moment they</i>
<i>have to give up</i>

<i>the real one</i>
<i>for the imagined,</i>

<i>the equation changes.</i>

<i>How much is there?</i>

A little over
a million.

We're gonna be
okay, Jordan.

Shay, I can't.

What do you mean?

Sorry.

No! But everything
was all set!

I have to take
this to Griffin.

J ust wait.
Think this through.

I already have.

<i>[Gunshot]</i>

Where did
you get that?

It was in the box
with the money.

What are you gonna do?
Shoot at me?

I'm sorry, but
I can't let you go.

Do whatever
you gotta do.

<i>Jordan I</i>

Jordan.

Goddamn.

Got the pictures?

We done?

Yeah.

Well, maybe
not quite.

<i>Get on your knees.</i>

What?

<i>I'm taking you</i>
<i>down, kid.</i>

And you can tell
every cop in
the station

that I took this
money from you

because nobody's ever
gonna believe you!

I placed a call to Hartley
to check out your
girlfriend's story.

There was no
scholarship, Warhol.

She never auditioned.
Hell, she never even
filled out an application.

Nobody there
knew anything about
a Shay Bettencourt.

<i>(Shay)</i>
<i>Get away from him.</i>

I'll do it.
Let him go.

<i>Shay, get out</i>
<i>of here.</i>

Shut up, Jordan.
Throw me your gun.

It's not
gonna happen.

<i>No, Shay I</i>

<i>[gunshot]</i>

We gotta go.

I'm not going
with you.

You don't have
a choice, Jordan.

Who are you?

<i>Me?</i>
<i>Who am I?</i>

I guess I'm just a girl
who saw an opportunity
and took it.

For the money?

I only have two
real talents, Jordan.

And the second one
is that I know what
the first one is.

That's why you needed me.
You knew just the right
buttons to push.

<i>You probably even have</i>
<i>the fucking log picked out</i>
<i>to crash his head in with I</i>

I lied about Hartley.

Okay, I did.
And I'm sorry.

Look at me.

I'm here, right?
I saved you,
didn't I?

You saved...
You saved me or
you saved the money?

<i>Believe whatever</i>
<i>you want.</i>

But the reality is if
you stay here, they're
gonna arrest you.

Okay?

Jordan?

<i>Come on.</i>

You do realize your
life is over,
don't you?

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>A good photographer</i>
<i>captures the subject.</i>

<i>But a good subject</i>

<i>captures the photographer.</i>

<i>I'd been captured alright.</i>

D?

<i>What the hell</i>
<i>happened?</i>

<i>How long have</i>
<i>you been here?</i>

Not long.

J ust got off the phone
with my dad.

<i>He's been out</i>
<i>all night.</i>

They found another
body at the glen.

Detective Griffin
from the Chandling case.

You know him?

Yeah.

That's the right
answer, Jordan.

<i>They took a look at</i>
<i>Griffin's phone records.</i>
<i>They saw you called him</i>

an hour before
this happened.
Tell me.

Where you there?

M hmm.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>I realized it.</i>

<i>What Shay meant.</i>

<i>My life,</i>
<i>as I knew it</i>

<i>was over.</i>

<i>[Door closes</i>
<i>at a distance]</i>

<i>(Desiree)</i>
<i>You better get out</i>
<i>of those clothes.</i>

Jordan!
Go!

Where were you
last night?

I was right here.

We'll take it
from here.

Jordan, would you
have a seat?

You know Detective
Griffin, right?

Yeah, um, I spoke
to him last week.
Spoke to him last week.

<i>Why did he come</i>
<i>and see you?</i>

I'm friends with a girl
who was involved
with M r. Chandling.

Who is this girl?

It's just someone
from school.

<i>We found these</i>
<i>images on Detective</i>
<i>Griffin's computer.</i>

<i>I don't know anything</i>
<i>about pictures like these.</i>

<i>[All interrogate</i>
<i>at the same time]</i>

<i>Where you</i>
<i>at the glen</i>
<i>last night?</i>

<i>[All talk at</i>
<i>the same time]</i>

<i>Where were you</i>
<i>last night, Jordan?</i>

I was here.

<i>(Ben)</i>
<i>We'd like to help you, but</i>
<i>you're crossing the line.</i>

And I think
you should leave.

You know, M r. Wells,
we will come back
with that subpoena.

You don't have
to get a subpoena.

<i>Who's this?</i>

Desiree Thomas.

D A Thomas' daughter.

I was with Jordan
last night.

<i>We were right here.</i>

Are there any
other questions?

Well, I guess
that's it then.

You know what,
M r. Wells...

I think
that's enough.
Thanks for your time.

<i>(J ulia)</i>
<i>I'll see you out.</i>

That won't be
necessary.

How well did
you know this girl?

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>I was just</i>
<i>hanging out.</i>

Jesus Christ, Jordan.
Tell me the truth.

Do not let them
blindside me with
something else.

There's nothing else.

There better
not be.

D, I, uh...

I don't know
what to say.

You know
what, Jordan?

Neither do I.

I just bought you
two days, maybe three.

But this isn't
over, Jordan.

<i>(Jordan)</i>
<i>It was the final gift</i>
<i>she would ever give me.</i>

<i>Her last favor.</i>

<i>It's strange to think</i>
<i>of your future in</i>
<i>terms of days.</i>

<i>But it wasn't going to</i>
<i>take those detectives</i>
<i>any longer than that.</i>

<i>Money was her</i>
<i>only way out.</i>

<i>And now it became mine.</i>

<i>And that's why I</i>
<i>transferred most of</i>
<i>the money to another bag</i>

<i>before meeting Griffin.</i>

<i>The money was</i>
<i>the only leverage</i>
<i>I had left.</i>

<i>There's always a moment.</i>

<i>Sometimes more</i>
<i>than one.</i>

<i>When you can walk away.</i>

<i>Choose not to play a role</i>
<i>someone else may be</i>
<i>writing for you.</i>

<i>Reality finally</i>
<i>kicked in.</i>

<i>For my life,</i>

<i>it was time I started</i>
<i>writing my own script.</i>

<i>My name's Jordan Wells.</i>

<i>A marketer's report</i>
<i>on me would read</i>
<i>something like this.</i>

<i>Rich, privileged,</i>

<i>future doctor,</i>

<i>future lawyer,</i>

<i>future somebody.</i>

<i>But you wouldn't expect</i>
<i>an accessory to murder.</i>

<i>Twice.</i>

<i>With a million dollars</i>
<i>to decide what</i>
<i>to do next.</i>

<i># She dances for you #</i>

<i># I n the fading</i>
<i>Sun light #</i>

<i># We're loosing</i>
<i>This battle #</i>

<i># From the start #</i>

<i># It's fatal within #</i>

<i># If she knows</i>
<i>How to use it #</i>

<i># She could tear</i>
<i>Your life apart #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Some one you</i>
<i>Could find strange #</i>

<i># To walk away #</i>

<i># If only you</i>
<i>Could clear</i>
<i>Your twisted vision #</i>

<i># To see through victory #</i>

<i># Before there's</i>
<i>Nothing left #</i>

<i># J ust the paces</i>
<i>on your life #</i>

<i># They crumbled</i>
<i>I n her hands</i>
<i>As you fell #</i>

<i># To a fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># It's the killing now #</i>

<i># And tell if your</i>
<i>Reasoning is dying #</i>

<i># How many times #</i>

<i># M ust you get</i>
<i>Yourself found #</i>

<i># Before you</i>
<i>Stop beauty</i>
<i>At the fire #</i>

<i>[inaudible]</i>

<i># You're not the first</i>
<i>To discover #</i>

<i># To her is just a game</i>
<i>Laced with desire #</i>

<i># It was too late</i>
<i>To escape #</i>

<i># When the poison</i>
<i>Was flowing #</i>

<i># And she carved</i>
<i>Out her name</i>
<i>Across my heart #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>

<i># It's a fatal beauty #</i>

<i># Fatal beauty #</i>
