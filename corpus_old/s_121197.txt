Under power of the State,
I am hereby authorized to put you...

Lee Ray Oliver,
to death by lethal injection.

Is there anything
you'd like to say?

Fuck you!

Fuck every last one of you!

Fuck you!

Cover that up, please.

Let 's get the bag open.

Thank you.

Where am I?
You're in the County Morgue.

I'm not dead.

The injections you got were all
saltwater except the anesthetic.

What the fuck is going on?
You're getting an opportunity...

to be part of a medical
research project.

If you agree to participate
in the experiment...

I'll take you toe tag here put
it on that body over there.

He'll be cremated,
you'll go on with these gentlemen.

If you don't agree the doctor will
inject you with sodium pentathol...

and the execution will proceed
right now in this room.

What kind of experiment?

It 's a behaviour
modifying drug trial.

Who the fuck are you?
I'm a neuropharmacologist.

I'm involved in the research
and development of new drugs.

I like drugs!
The drug we're going to give you...

is not a narcotic. It won't
give you narcotic sensations.

And there may be side effects.
Some severe, possibly fatal.

You want me to be a guinea pig?
No, you'll be a test subject.

You have 1 minute
to make your decision.

Fuck you, Warden!

Proceed.

This is your last chance to do
something good in your life.

A chance to give something
back to society.

Fuck society! What the fuck
has society ever done for me?

Doctor!

Just wait!

Wherever we're going I hope it
smells better that it did in there.

Let 's go.

You greedy fuck!

So now you see how it goes.

Every time I say fuck...

he does that!
Because you, Warden...

have a lot of fucking nerve!

You thought you're gonna
get another one, didn't you?

But I said fucking, not fuck.

Please, stop!
Didn't I pay you well...

to let my men go after
Lee Ray in prison?

When Lee Ray offered him instead,
did I complain? No.

I didn't give a flying fuck!

I found out the State was gonna
execute him. So I am satisfied.

But now you tell me that
Lee Ray is actually alive...

and that you will find
out where he is...

if I pay you?

I'm sorry,
I'll do it for free. It 's fair!

You'll find him, and we'll kill him.

Third time's the charm, right?

Yes, Mr. Vertov. Third time's the...

Don't fuck up!

You'll start off by taking
one pill every six hours.

Wait a fucking minute!
Wait a minute.

What 's this pill gonna do?

My name is Dr. Copeland. I designed
the medication you'll be taking.

It 's called Anagress. It works by
altering the brain's chemistry...

by suppressing your violent tendencies.
And with you aggression reduced...

you'll begin to experience feelings
of good will and compassion...

a sense of right and wrong,
even remorse over past mistakes.

Good fucking luck.
This is the first time Anagress...

has been tried on humans. We don't
know what the side effects are.

Hopefully they're minor:
Dry mouth, dizziness, nausea...

but there is a chance they
could be more severe.

Like what?

Liver failure, brain seizures...

...a stroke...
Whatever.

Years ago, they might have
given you a lobotomy...

carved out a piece of your brain
like a rotten part of an apple.

But today we're more civilized.
We do it biochemically.

I rather have a bottle in front
of me than a frontal lobotomy!

How long is your little
experiment gonna last?

It 's never over.
You and the other 19 test subjects...

will be observed indefinitely.

That ' one pill every six hours.

Open wide.

Let 's go.

Open back up.

Smart man.

Hey, Michael! How you doing?
Good. I'm doing good.

Excellent.

Is that Austin?

He scored two goals
in the first half.

He's getting real tall.
They grow up so fast, don't they?

Ah, jeez!

I just came to see
how the team was doing.

We're doing good.

It 's not the same, but...
No. Nothing is.

Yes!

The guy seems a real teddy bear.
Two days and not a peep.

I want blood,
urine and saliva samples.

I have a PET scan and
SPECT scheduled.

Add a cerebral spinal
fluid analysis.

Yes, doctor.

Mr. Oliver...

we're going to remove
your last restraint.

<i>Iwant you to relax.</i>

I just died and live
to talk about it.

<i>It doesn't get more
relaxed than this.</i>

Is it all right
if I smoke in here?

<i>We have a security breach.</i>

<i>I repeat,
we have a security breach.</i>

Go!

We got him!

The man is a fucking animal.
He's perfect!

Hey, Aiku!

<i>- Shit!
Zone 8 activated.</i>

<i>- Zone 8 activated.
Aiku!</i>

Hello.
There you are!

I've been looking for you everywhere.
You've changed the code again.

I'm sorry. We agreed you were
gonna call before you came by.

It 's my weekend.
You knew I was coming by.

I forgot. I'm sorry.
How unusual!

Hello, Aiku!
How are you?

What happened? You look terrible!
It was a rough day at the office.

You look terrific, by the way.

I got a call from Jenny. She said
you showed up at the soccer match.

That was fast!
She was worried about you.

And I'm worried about you too.

I just wanted do feel
what it was like to...

be there again.

I hurt too, you know.
I know.

That 's why I've gotta go.
I know that too.

Come on. Time to go to mom's house.
Next time I call before I come.

All right.
Come on!

You never told me your
ex was so beautiful.

How long have you been here?
Not long.

I was just in the pool
and I saw her drive up.

It wouldn't be a brilliant idea for me
to be toweling off in the living room.

I went upstairs and
hid in your closet.

How's your jaw?

The truth?

I'm gonna make you feel better.
Make me forget everything.

Can you do that for me?

I can try.

What the hell is going on?
Take the pill first.

Where's my hair?
Where's my tattoos?

Erased. Like your past.

In the next few weeks we'll be
making changes on your outside...

while the medication
changes you on the inside.

After what you guys did to me, you
guys should be taking these pills!

OK, but you first.

Attaboy.

The guy is pretty good.
Beat my high score.

Seratonine metabolate levels?

Barely registering.

The guy is a textbook sociopath.

Is it true he stabbed an inmate
in the eye with a screwdriver?

Yes. He goes for the head.

Increase game difficulty.
Ok.

Let 's crank it up to mach 5.

How'd he do with his MMPI?
Just what you'd expect from...

a guy with antisocial
personality disorder...

...with psychotic tendencies.
And that 's just for starters.

Your fucking thing is rigged!

<i>You can't hit a thing!</i>

Fuck!

This fucking thing is rigged!

Get the fuck...

Get the fuck...
thing is rigged!

This thing is fucked up!
It 's a broken machine!

Get the fuck outta here!

Fix your fucking machine!

There goes 1O grand.

Take it out of my paycheck.

Nikolai Vertov. 27 years old.

Do you ever feel bad
about taking his life?

Bad? I feel really bad.
You do? Tell me.

If I'd known the motherfucker was
the nephew of a Russian mobster...

I never would've robbed him, let
alone put a bullet through his head.

Manoel Jose Gutierrez.

You ever been in prison, Doc?
Let 's not get distracted.

I didn't think so. It 's probably
not what you're exactly used to.

The Russian mobster took a contract
out on me for killing his nephew.

Gutierrez here tried to
cash in on that contract.

I just defended myself.

You felt justified in...
I felt fucking justified!

I don't give a fuck if you believe
me or not! That 's what happened.

I got the jump on him,
he's dead, I'm alive.

Gary David Caputo.

We got a minor bump.

He's alive.

Just a little worse for wear.
Tell me what happened with him.

Just wrong place, wrong time.
It 's not my problem.

You threatened to kill his brother
for testifying at the trial.

Is that true?
Are we done? This is getting boring.

You were 12 years old
when your mother died?

You know exactly how old I was!
These files have discrepancies.

I just wanna make sure I get it right.
A former boyfriend killed her...

and you witnessed the murder.
Is that true?

Just give me the drugs
and let 's get on with it.

You never said anything about
answering any of these questions!

Just answer the question.
I'll answer whatever I want!

And don't you go talking to
me like that. I'm not your kid!

If you don't answer the question,
you're of no use to me.

I'll transfer you back to the
custody of the warden right now.

You are only alive because of me.

Why don't you answer the questions,
so I can help you?

I was 1O...

not 12.

I was 1O.

Thank you.

Yes, I saw her
thrashing around.

I saw the whole
goddamn thing.

And then the fuck who killed
her took a piss in front of me.

Then he turned around and said:
"When you got to go...

you got to go".

You wanna hear about what my
uncle John used to do with me?

He had a little hobby
that he called golf.

He used to beat me with his
driver every Tuesday night.

Write that down. Why don't you
write a fucking book about it?

All right, that 's enough for today.
It is e-fucking-nough!

I'm everything you hate
in the world, huh, Doc?

He's more at ease.
Much less agitated.

Five of the rhesus monkeys showed
results after only three doses.

When is his next PET scan?
"Ma√±ana".

Let 's do it now.

Hey, Doc!
How ya doin'?

I'm actually doing really good!
It 's strange. I feel... different.

Everything seems clearer,
I feel less wound up.

Good.

Shit... it really works.
We just got to do...

Come here!

Everybody, get away!

Nobody move! Back up!

I'm gonna stick this
pen in his eye!

Put the fucking guns down!

Get away!
Put it down!

So what he says!
Put the gun down!

Help me outta here, Doc.
I will!

Put 'em down!

Put the guns down!

Get away! Put the guns down!

Put it down!

I swear to fucking Christ
it 's going in his eye!

Tell him to put the gun down.

Do as he says.
Get outta here!

Tell me how to get outta here!

Tell me how to get outta here!

We'll take it from here.

Get the fuck... jeez...

You're just as fucked
up as I am, Doc.

You got a fancy suit...
You're just as fucked up as I am.

You're just as fucked up.
Get off of me!

Jesus, are you okay.

Increase the dosage.
8 milligrams three times a day.

That 's more than 3 times
the previous.

Just do it.

<i>Hart-Mercer Pharmaceuticals...</i>

<i>dedicated to making the world
a happier,healthier place.</i>

<i>Now and in years ahead,
we will continue our...</i>

You are too involved.
There's a reason why they...

don't want a primary researcher
conducting his own clinical trial.

The man is out of control. Unsuitable.
We'll find another one.

We have to give him more time.
I'm increasing the dosage.

If you don't like it, you can hand
my resignation in to the board.

Be careful. If one threatens to
resign one time too many...

they get taken up on it.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, Senior
V.P. Of Research and Development...

Dr. Arlo Penner.

Thank you.

Not too long ago, the acronym
SSRI was virtually unheard of.

Now, of course, Selective
Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitors...

help millions of people
lead better lives.

Today, as we speak...

a new class of pharmaceuticals
is being developed...

that has the potential to
change society as we know it.

As you're probably aware,
the reason why Hart-Mercer stock...

remains strong within this
volatile market sector...

is largely because of Dynax.

And I'm pleased to be able
to announce to you that...

Dynax has once again
been named...

as this year's most
prescribed anti-depressant.

So, on behalf of...

the board of directors and the
shareholders of Hart-Mercer...

I wanna thank you,
Dr. Michael Copeland...

for your groundbreaking work
which continues to this day.

Congratulations, doctor.
Thanks.

You look surprised to see me.
Maybe a little.

Did you forget that
I'm a shareholder?

Made us both rich.

As you keep climbing the ladder,
don't forget to count the rungs.

Remember when all we wanted
was that one bedroom house?

With our very own washer and dryer.

And I was gonna open up a center...
Stop. You're making me feel old.

How are you?
I'm good.

Congratulations, doctor.
Thanks.

Barbara, this is Eden Ross.
She's a post-doc. Part of the team.

Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

When I was an undergrad...

I read your paper on the educational
deficits effect on family violence.

It was really brilliant.
Thanks.

Now I officially do feel old.
Next time invent a pill for that. Bye.

Nice seeing ya.
Bye.

So am I gonna see you tonight?
I hope so.

Are you buying a car?

Tuesday! Must be beef stew.
I wouldn't be too sure.

I'm sorry, Lee Ray.

It 's all right. It 's cool.
No swat.

I'll get something to clean it up.

He didn't hit me.
I could've made that accident...

more natural.

This is very good, gentlemen.
I did a decent Yago, senior year.

Who the hell is Yago?
We've got his MAO level.

Lambda K three is point one four.

This is your last chance to do
something good in your life.

OK. I'll be right there.

Who was it?
Security.

I'll go with you.

Come on, man, just chill.
It 's all right.

No, it 's not.

I'm gonna be sick again.
Take a deep breath.

What 's going on?

What 's going on?

I can see his face.
Whose face?

Gary Caputo's.

Wrong time, wrong place.

He was just standing on the
stairs with a bag of groceries.

I should've just ran by, passed him
and just gotten the hell outta there.

It 's OK.

He was in a coma
for seven months.

He had to learn to do
everything all over again.

When I was in prison,
I used to joke about him.

I used to brag about how
I made the guy into a vegetable.

What 's important is you know
that what you did is wrong.

The treatment is working.

It 's working.
Why can't I sleep?

I wanna put my head on my pillow...

close my eyes and don's
see his face anymore.

It 's gonna be OK.

We'll give him Somnubel.
5 milligrams.

Brock, that 's two tablets
whenever he can't sleep.

Ladies and gentlemen...

we've got remorse.

How can we be sure
he's not faking again?

All of his biomarkers back it up.

Ever since week 5 his serotonin
and MAO levels have improved...

limbic and amygdale activity...

as well as BFS measures
have responded in kind.

I think we're ready for Phase 2.

Are you sure? The board
and I both believe that is...

absolutely your call.

But we all know the risks involved
in moving forward too quickly.

It 's going to work. I think that
we've uncreated a monster.

Lot more cell phones!
Tell me about it.

This thing is tight.
You'll get used to it.

The only way that truly gauge...

the effects of Anagress is to
observe you in the real world.

A controlled environment
can only tell us so much.

I haven't been on the
outside in a long time.

What if I fall on my ass?
You get back up.

This is it?

I thought you were made of money.
Beats your last address.

That 's fine, guys.

Thanks.
Let 's do it again.

What 's your name?
Joe Monroe.

And what have you been
doing for the last 5 years?

Working in Cincinnati, Ohio,
in a packaging plant.

Loading boxes in a warehouse.
Good.

Here's 3OO bucks and an
ID to get you started.

And then what?
Another 3OO next week.

You're on your own.

It 's nice.

There's nothing in the fridge!
Guess you'd better go to the store.

Something wrong?

No, just looking at the view.

All right.

I'll let you get settled.

He hasn't stabbed anybody in
the eye yet. So, that 's a start.

Eden, I want a seratonin
metabolite analysis.

Attaboy!

Tracking okay?
We're on.

Oh, man, he's oh for eight.

What we'll do if no
one will hire him?

The question is, what he'll do?

He's into current events now?

He's checking out the classifieds.
Impressive!

Yeah, Sully. Sully from inside.
He told me to call you.

25O is all I can spare,
you understand?

Why? 'Cause I gotta
buy groceries.

Sully, yes.

All right. Good.
I'll see you there.

You guys hiring?
You see a Help Wanted sign?

You in the blue shirt.
Come here.

What?
Think I can help you.

You can fill out this application.

What d'ya wanna know?
The usual.

I know everything about cars.
Foreign, American, everything.

All you need to know is how to drive
them 1O feet without crashing them.

I could do that.

I'm gonna have to get back to you
for the numbers for references.

Don't worry. Put any number. I'm
the one who makes the phone calls.

Give these away to people who get the
hot wax. You getting the hot wax?

No, sir.
He's filling out the application.

It 's looking really good.

Are you a hard worker?
Very hard.

Take drugs?
No. Vitamins, but that 's it.

You bullshitting me? I don't
want drug addicts working for me.

I don't take drugs.
Honest. No drugs.

I'll start you at 5,75 an hour,
plus tips.

Go grab a rag and talk to Alfonso.
Tell him Ralph sent you.

I'll be back at one.
Thank you.

Here. Better go before
he changes his mind.

Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
Sure.

You Sully's friend?

Do I know you?

I'm Sully's friend.

You got what I want?

You sound like someone
I knew. I think he's dead.

Some son-of-a-bitch he was.
I guess he can be me then.

What 's he doing?
Looking for us.

I'd say that Lee Ray just took
the hidden out of hidden camera.

Nightmares again?

Can't give you any more.
Doc said two pills a night, max.

Did you ever try these things?

Nah. Soon as I hit
the bed, I'm out.

My daddy used to say that...

an honest man's pillow
is his peace of mind.

Wanna play cards? It 's gonna take 2O
minutes for these things to kick in.

I'm not supposed to do anything
that could affect your environment.

Winning a hand of cards is
really gonna affect my life!

Come on, I've got this
kick-ass root beer here.

You won't let me have any alcohol,
so I sprang for the good stuff.

All right,
but then I'm out the door.

Cheers.

How long have you been
working with theses guys?

Three years this month.
I used to be a cop in Detroit...

but this is much better.

I'm not even supposed to
talk to you. I gotta go.

Get some sleep.
No, take it with you.

It 's fine.
Thanks, man.

What are you wearing?

Really?

Is that all?

I think you are a
very naughty girl.

Shit!

Come on, Brock.

<i>I see your goddamn walkie.</i>

<i>The Blue Line for Davenport
now boarding on Track 4.</i>

Dr. Copeland?
It 's Norton. We've lost him.

The train is bound to Davenport.
We got him on GPS.

This piece of shit has been playing
a big con on us all along.

That 's not possible.

What the hell's he
doing in Davenport?

Shit. That 's where
Gary Caputo lives.

The guy Lee Ray shot
in the stairwell?

And his brother that testified
against Lee Ray lives there too.

Bill's not here!

Gary?

Bill's not here.

I'm not looking for Bill.

I came here to see you.

I like this commercial.

Who are you?

My name is Joe.

I don't know anyone named Joe.
I'm a new friend.

I wanna tell you something.

Long time ago,
somebody hurt you.

Really bad.
They hurt you really bad.

And they want me to tell you they
were really sorry for what they did.
