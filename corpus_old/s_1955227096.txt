[Music playing]

And next to me, I guess, is
we have one of the producers,

Who's producer [inaudible].

And I think that Lloyd Kaufman
is one of the producers

That is hard to ignore.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Everyone
should be paying

Attention to what we are doing.

It doesn't matter
what you're doing.

Pay attention!
MAN: OK.

Here we go.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I have
to tell everybody

Eight times everything we do.

We got to tell
you, you, you, you.

Pay attention!

MAN: At Troma
Entertainment, they seem

To be everywhere all the time.

It's a very impressive
organization.

People who make... we call
ourselves the Troma team.

People are not making a
Troma movie for the money.

They're not making a Troma
movie to get a big hotel suite.

They're making art.

INTERVIEWER: So what have we
been waiting for right now?

I'm waiting to squeeze
a fart out of this PA.

MAN: He was the director
and the producer

And the writer, I believe,
of "Class of Nuke 'Em High,"

"Toxic Avenger."

The latest film
is "Terror Fimer."

Yes.

On CNN or something,
they're giving

Advice to up-and... filmmakers.

And the first thing
they said is, please

Don't make a movie
about making a movie.

Nobody cares.

It's about a Troma
film crew, right?

And they're shooting
"The Toxic Avenger 4."

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

This smells like the first mask.

But there's a
serial killer that's

Picking them off one by one.

MAN IN BUSHES: [screaming]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

MAN: Cut!

And as Lloyd Kaufman
would say, it's

"Henry, Portrait
of a Serial Killer"

Meets "Living in
Oblivion" through the eyes

Of Frank Capra.

The way this project
began was we reflected,

What is independent art?

What is independent cinema?

And in the process
of doing so, we

Remembered there were a lot
of interesting anecdotes

Along the way in Tromaville
over the past 25 years.

Would you say this
is a good B movie?

It's gonna be a great B movie.

A great B movie?

A great B movie.

We had some great pyrotechnics,
explosions, people on fire,

Decapitations, leg
amputations, two-sex freak.

I can't even tell you anymore,
because if Lloyd watches

This thing, I just want him to
know that I'm not giving away

The ending or any
crucial plots to "Terror"

"Firmer," just enough to
entice people, hook 'em in.

So this movie is about a
young group of people for whom

The film that they
are making is the most

Important thing in their lives.

of this movie isn't really

"Terror Firmer," it's
called... what were

We talking about in the van?

It's called "Seven Days
of Sleep Deprivation."


They're led on their
quest to make great art

By a blind, broken down,
independent, low-budget movie

Director.

It's very close to the
storyline of this film,

You know?

Coffee and no cops.

Director getting frustrated.

Nothing happening.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Only because the
people are too fucking lazy,

We had a goddamn day off.

And they use it as a day off.

People on the production ought
to be here doing the planning.

The whole fucking week
has been fucked up.

Actors totally out of it.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: You're about 10
minutes too later there, Neve.

The minute she turns
to move, get in there.

We are this movie.

Everything that
has been predicted

Is going to come true,
right down to people

Being killed onset in savage
and unprovoked murders.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: We're in
the fucking pickles here.

We're in the fuckin'... we're
never gonna finish this thing.

[Music playing]

MAN: Oh, no.

MAN: (DISGUSTED) Oh.

MAN: Pull Camera A.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

MAN: (LAUGHING) Yeah, Troma.

[Vomiting sound]

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Where's the blood?

Where's the blood?
Dagnabbit.

Where's the blood?

Don't do that.


Don't do anything like that.


Dammit, could people
listen, please?

And if someone's killed on my
set, I'll blow my brains out.

[Music playing]


LLOYD KAUFMAN: [groaning]

What is that?

Can you show that to me?

What is that?

It's Toxie's head on
Lloyd's mind stick.

INTERVIEWER: How goes it?

Pretty well.

We're readying scene
nine right now, which

Is where Toxie and
Sarah are making

Sweet, sweet love to each
other with the cityscape

In the background.

Interesting trivia
fact about this scene

Is that right now the actor
playing the Toxic Avenger

Is drunk.

INTERVIEWER: Toxie, you
are in high spirits today.

Oh, absolutely.

I feel that I am especially
superheroes today.

Yeah, yeah.

INTERVIEWER: That's the keyword.

If there was any troubles
within the city of Manhattan

Right now, me as
the Toxic Avenger

Would come to the
rescue of Giuliani.

(IN DEEP VOICE) Looking for me?

You know?

So you get the technology plus
the campy Speed Racer stuff.

And that's pretty much
how I've conquered Toxie.

INTERVIEWER: Kick ass.


Check out my Toxie outfit.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: This works.

WOMAN: It's too short.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Why don't
we... why don't we just take

The scissors?

ROY DAVID: That's
what I'm thinking.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.
It's up to you, Roy.

You tell us what you want to do.

ROY DAVID: It
doesn't matter to me.

Whatever makes the art the art.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Just don't
cut... I think you'll be...

ROY DAVID: I do [inaudible]
drawers halfway dropped.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, yeah.

No, drop the drawers.
Everything's great.

Just don't cut the T-shirt.
ROY DAVID: OK.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: That way
you can go up or down.

See?

The more ass I show,
the happier I am.

You know?

I got a good ass.

INTERVIEWER: How we
doing there, Steven?

We're doing pretty good.

We're a little bit
behind schedule today.

What are we doing?

Thank you very much.

We're going to
have a blocking, so

The actors... let's bring the
actors in for the blocking,

Please.

Could we clear
all non-essentials

From set, please?

Close set.

OK.
Here we go.

Picture's up.

Five, please. [Inaudible].

Ready and slate in.

Roll sound.

INTERVIEWER: What's that?
MAN: OK, here we go.

See if he gets hit.
MAN: Very quiet, please.

Roll the picture.

I can see.


I can see.

I'm coming!

Oh, and I can see!

I'm seeing it.

I'm coming!

And it's so beautiful!


LLOYD KAUFMAN: I
see myself coming.

I see myself coming.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
that's the funny line.

I'm coming, and I'm seeing...
I can see myself coming, right?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I'm coming, I'm
coming. (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)

I could see, I could see.

And then a, I see myself
coming, and it's so beautiful!

Ah!

Well, this is when the arm goes
into the television like this.

What we're doing is we're
shooting it backwards.

So I'm gonna pull this,
and it's gonna come away.

Watch your back,
camera comin' through.

MAN: Camera moves.
Watch your backs, folks.

Watch it.

But when they reverse
it, it's going to be

Going into the television.

INTERVIEWER: So
you're going to flip

The camera over and shoot it?

And then they got
to play it backwards

When the guys are editing it?

Yeah.

MAN: One, two, three!

It's a cut.

MAN: Good.

INTERVIEWER: That's gonna
be a seamless effect.

[Clap and cheer]

Eh.

INTERVIEWER: What's up, Lloyd?

What are you doing?

Cheat sheets?

Doing the, uh... trying to
figure out how we can make up

98% of the day in 10 minutes.

We like... we've done,
like, 2% of the work.

And the day is 2/3 over.

INTERVIEWER: Any ideas?

We'll cut out a
lot of scenes, yeah.

INTERVIEWER: [chuckle]

Sir.

Steven, uh, what... let's say we
finish with this thing at 3:00.

I think we should go to number
25, turn off the midget.

Is the midget here?

The midget's call is pretty
much in 10, 15 minutes.

So she'll be here.

I think that the midget
scene is a very simple scene.

All right.

So then let's go... let's do 25
and just tear ass through it.

You gotta get people
to move, though.

The midget scene could be very
nice at magic hour as well,

You know?

Yeah, all right.

Now costumes.

Who's costumes?

Is he gonna be OK?

Can you lift your
skirt like that?

MAN: Yes.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

Nobody talk.

Let's just go.


Here we go.

Standing by.

Action.

Breathe, Melvin.
Breathe!


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Come out.

You can do it!

It's coming!

I can feel it!

Mommy!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

Good.

INTERVIEWER: So are you
doing a scene today?

Yeah, we're doing
a scene today.

INTERVIEWER: Which one?

The opening montage where the
individual, Ariel, gets his leg

Ripped off and
beaten about the head

Dramatically by the
mysterious woman.

INTERVIEWER: So what aspect
will you be playing in this?

Actually, I'm the
stunt coordinator.

I'm gonna make
sure that nothing...

INTERVIEWER: Oh!

Right now Steven, our line
producer's with an officer,

Discussing whether or not...
Oh, we're... they're checking

Out our permit.

So we got thrown off...

We were supposed
to film over here.

The police came, said that...

MAN: In your trunk?

WOMAN: Yes.
that we couldn't.

That was basically it.

Now we're moving in here.

The big, fat pigs from New York
just threw us off the street

Where we had a permit.

And because of some
kind of promoting.

Can you imagine if it had
been Paramount of Time Warner?

You think they would
have thrown them off?

Right?

Having lived in Los
Angeles, I really admire

The New York Police Department.

INTERVIEWER: [laughs]

Believe me, they
would have shot us.

Now, the LAPD
would have shot us.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

MAN: Yeah.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Call it!

MAN: Shot 124.

MAN: We got speed?
MAN: Speed.

MAN: Mark it.

MAN: Mark.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: And...

[Truck squealing in background]

Action!

(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
Boy, just the kind

Of king-size pussy that I like.

Hey, what are you doing?!

Wh... that's my leg!

Oh!

Oh-oh!


Come back, you bitch!

You punk ass!


Oh!


MAN: Oh, ugh-oh, gees.

INJURED MAN: Ah!

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

INJURED MAN: Holy shit.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Are you OK, Eric?


MAN: That's what they wanted.

MAN: What happened to your head?

They had to do a scene where
they pour water on my head.

It's like a giant
thing of water.

So the only little
thing is that there's

A big, heavy cap to the jug.

So they don't take the
top of the jug off.

So the jug hits me in the head.

But this is troubling.

Lock up the set.

Pick it up, clean
it up, and shut up.


Cut!
Cut.

Cut.
MAN: That's a cut.

That's a cut.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Freeze,
freeze, freeze.

MAN: You gotta be careful.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Freeze!

When I say "freeze,"
use that thing.

Freeze.
Freeze.

Thank you.

The shit is so gross, though.

I'm so sorry.


Hey, but it... but it just
smells like soup, right?

Yeah.

It smells like... it's
basically... we're dumping

A can of barley soup on you.

And then I squished
it up... like,

There's blood chunks that we
poured into it the other night.

So same thing, it's just brown.

ROY DAVID: So it's
all chunky and clear.

So I'll just pretend like I'm
down in some bullshit Palm

Springs health
club where they're

Always pouring all this stuff.

It's got water.

MAN: OK, folks, can
we have all actors...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Now what?

What... I want to... what are the
things that are in the... oh,

There's a condom.

Excellent.

WOMAN: Cigarette butts.

RUTH PONGSTAPHONE-SAFER:
Lots of toilet paper.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

And you gotta make
it thick enough.

I'm coming in a minute.

Just... look.

Just make it thick enough, so
that when it's on the ground,

It isn't going to
evaporate or dribbling off

And then it disappears.

Looks great.

Yeah.

See, look, worried that what's
gonna happen is when they close

The door, all of that
stuff is just gonna

Run in to non-visible land.

This stuff should be,
like, painted on, so

That it's there... so it sticks.

Then right before the take,
we'll put a shitload on him.

Let's see how it...

Yes, I am giving
mouth-to-mouth to Roy.

INTERVIEWER: Are you
excited about it?

No.

INTERVIEWER: Are you
excited about getting

Mouth-to-mouth from Yaniv?

Absolutely.

This'll be the first
man I've kissed.

MAN: It's got to have
a lot in his mouth,

So when Yaniv comes down,
it gets on his face.

MAN: Yeah.

MAN: Right before the take.


YANIV SHARON: Don't
worry, everyone.

I know CPR.

[Disgusted groans]

Can we do that
mouth-to-mouth again?

I lost my turd when I dove out.

I had no turd to spit out.

INTERVIEWER: What was it
like to kiss Roy David?

Well, I gave him
mouth-to-mouth, technically.

There was one part,
though... I know

I'm gonna get killed for this,
but when his mouth was open...

And usually when I go down,
his mouth is closed and I just,

Like, breathe over his mouth.

But his mouth was open.

And I think I got a little
bit tongue in there.

So you know, but I'm
not gay or anything.

I think it was actually the
fecal matter-shaped... I mean,

The fecal matter-shaped
Tootsie roll.

It might've been the terd...
But hopefully, it was the turd.

But I don't know.

But any man that would
get excited covered in shit

And still be able to be aroused,
I've got problems with that.

That's a fetish of some sort.

It's kind of soft to be the
turd, because the turd was

Already hard and painted over.

But I did feel flesh to flesh.

So I was a little concerned.

As long as Yaniv didn't have
any movement in his groin area,

I think we're OK on
the homosexuality wrap.

I'm pretty sure I'm not
gay, not that being gay's

A bad thing.

INTERVIEWER: Can an onset
romance ever work out?

For Yaniv and I, I
seriously doubt it,

Because he's a
little out of shape,

And I prefer my men or women
a little bit more muscular.

INTERVIEWER: Would you be
gay for Roy David, though?

No.

No, no.

I had, like, his
tongue... I tasted Roy.

Ugh!

(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Don't
shit where you eat, my friend.

Action.

Well, you see...

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

[Interposing french voices]

You gotta keep driving,
too. [Inaudible].

From then on, it's
you're only French.

Well, I think there
has to be some... maybe

You start speaking French.

[Stutters in french]

You know, do a whole thing.

And because the car has to
go a little out of control.

Do you want this to be more
like that, the (IN STRONG

(FRENCH ACCENT) ho, ho, ho, ho?


I think just you're
like a really cool guy.

You know, you're
really a hot shit.

MAN: (IN SUAVE FRENCH ACCENT)
More like that, you know?

Hey.

(IN SUAVE FRENCH ACCENT) You
sure are lucky we pick you up,

You know?

We could have taken anybody
tonight, and we pick you.

You have to talk about breasts.

Sorry, breasts.

Because after this, a
big-breasted woman's

On the set of the movie.

She's shot and her
breasts explode.

MAN: OK.

I think really more
talk about big breasts.

So she's angry.

So later when you
see the woman getting

Blown away, [inaudible].

Also, I think we're gonna try to
create a thing where you keep...

There will be lots of vomit.

It will just keep
MAN: Great.

Spewing.

INTERVIEWER: Jeanne, what did
you make the vomit out of?

It's just bread, bread crumbs,
corn muffins, cranberries,

Poppy seeds, and water.

And then he's gonna
have the Bromo, too.

So he'll froth and...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: You ready?

Hold on.

Don't drink the vomit yet.

Carrie's gonna put
some Bromo in her mouth

While the camera's
rolling and the vomit

In her mouth at the same time.

I think we should go...
We'll go to the... hopefully,

You'll be able to keep it in.

If not, just vomit on him.

And then we keep
the vomit going.

We just keep vomiting.

OK?

This has to be
ultra-realism, too.



LLOYD KAUFMAN: Start
talking, Joseph.


Again, again.


Don't lean out the car.

Stay where you are. [Inaudible].


Cut, cut, cut!

I am very happy to have that
scene with Lloyd Kaufman,

Because I really wanted it.

You know?

And nobody will recognize me.

That's a good one.

MAN: You guys work hard.

MAN: Yeah.

MAN: And I think
it's very important.

Oh, look at the roof.

We make the vomit, and
we get to clean it up.

(IN WELSH ACCENT)
Old ha-roof, ga-roof.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

Tom, whenever you're ready.

MAN: OK, Lloyd, come
in whenever you want.


Quiet!

Now look, I'm the director.

I'm the director.

Uh, uh, now look,
I am the director.

I'm not saying this is
something... but... ah, shit.

Let me do it again.

Sorry, I apologize.

MAN: Mark,

Mark it.

MAN: Ready, Lloyd.

a very dangerous world.

There are people
dying, and starving,

And being dismembered,
being maimed, being butt...

There is... look, it's
a very dangerous...

It's a very dangerous world.

MAN: The eyes.

It's a very dangerous world.

People are being... it's
a very dangerous world.

It's a very dangerous world.

People are dying.

They are starving.

They are being dismembered
as we speak, tortured.

They're being cornholed
all over the world.

It's dangerous.

It's worse on a movie set.

It's worse on a movie
set, because you've

Got danger and stupidity.

I don't want somebody
dying on my set.

If someone dies here,
I'll blow my brains out.

It'll be your fault.
My career will be over.

It'll be your fault!

And I'll... sorry.

Uh, cut.



MAN: And here we go.

We're all set.

MAN: Mark it.

MAN: Speed.

MAN: Ready, Lloyd.

a very dangerous place.

People are being murdered,
and raped, and dismembered

All over the place.

They're dying of starvation.

They're being cornholed.

It's horrible.

It's worse here
on the movie set.

It's got... What are you doing?

You look like you're
talking to me.

I'm sorry.
I really can't...

All right.
It was the eyes.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I'm sorry.

I'm trying to
concentrate on you.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I
know, it's just, uh...

No, no, no, he doesn't need it.

He wants an empty script.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I thought
you... no, I'm sorry.

I wanted to bring up your eyes.

When I go like that, it's just
to remind you about your eyes.

OK, fair enough.
Sorry.

MAN: OK, here we go.
Going again.

And play it in.

MAN: Lloyd?
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah?

MAN: Don't rush it.
Five pickups on 258.

MAN: Mark it.

MAN: Mark.

Ready, Lloyd.

lurk... there's danger

Lurking everywhere.

It's a horrible world.

There's starvation,
dismemberment,

Torture, rape, cornholing.

It's all over the place.

But it's worse on a movie set.

It's worse, because there's
danger and stupidity.

And if someone's killed on my
set, I'll blow my brains out.

It'll be the end of my career.

And you, you will be at fault!

Cut.

MAN: OK, that's a cut.



MAN: Nice job.


No, no, listen, listen, let's
get a drink of water for Lloyd.

INTERVIEWER: If
I'm not mistaken,

Were you just promoted?


INTERVIEWER: Because
I remember you not

Having a headset the other day.

Yeah, well, people quit.

Jeff quit yesterday.

Oh, he didn't quit.
He...

INTERVIEWER: [inaudible].

Jeff was the key PA.

INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh.

Is it true that our
location manager quit?

Um, I am not sure.

I have heard the same rumor.

Well, she was complaining
about the lack of communication,

And the problems,
and blah, blah, blah.

INTERVIEWER: Is it true that
the second second AD quit?

Simon?

Yes, yes, yes.

INTERVIEWER: He quit?

Yes.

Yes.

His shirt got covered in blood.

INTERVIEWER: What?

His shirt got covered in blood.

INTERVIEWER: Is
that why he quit?

Yes.

The second... second
AD or third AD

Did the... he got sprayed with
blood and he had his shirt on.

INTERVIEWER: No, I heard it's
because his grandmother's sick

And in the hospital.

That was a totally
different person.

INTERVIEWER: Oh, really?

That's another person?

But don't make a... no, we don't
want to hear about I'm so hot,

I'm so tired.

It's negativity.

It's the fucking dao,
it's yin and yang,

Whatever you want to call it.

MAN: OK, [inaudible].

Just be one moment, please.

Stand by.

My crew is around there.

We have a fake camera.

OK.

He's gonna make a little speech
about this is the most squibs.

Then the squibs are going
to go off, bah-bah-bah-bah.

Brad, well, you definitely,
definitely want to shoot...

You definitely want to
shoot all of the stuff

Before the squibbs...

MAN: That you need.

That you need.

Because what happens is the
squibs, all the... you know,

They have little
cuts in the shirt.

They have little
cuts in the shirt.

Like, see how your T-shirt
looks nice and white,

Well, ours has little
things that probably

Stick out a little bit.

So anything new that
happens before the squibs

You definitely want to shoot.

Because you're gonna see
the squibs [inaudible].

After the squibs, it
doesn't matter, because he's

Got all the shit on him.

If you don't know exactly what
a squib is, it's just a patch...

Little packets of
blood... actually,

Condoms pretty much are filled
with blood with small charges

On 'em lit off by a
positive/negative fuse

Right here.

WOMAN: So it's electricity.

Exactly.

And they'll just
simultaneously go off, like

[Makes popping noises]

But as with anything with a
currency going through it,

There's a certain
sense of danger there.

So you got to be careful.

So I'm the one that's going
to be getting squibbed.

So a lot of charges going off.

And just be aware of
the safety factors here.

Listen up to what I say.
OK?

MAN: Yes, sir.

Keep your wits
about you, all right?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's
been said, by the way,

That "Troma's War" had
more squibs in that film

Used than any other
movie except perhaps

Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs."

WOMAN: Wow.

But "Troma's War"
did have a woman's

Breasts exploding, which is far
more historically significant.

Indeed so.



This one goes off first.

But then the rest
of them are all

Random throughout
his whole body.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, cool.
Excellent, excellent.

So just this one is first
so he knows what's going on.

And then from there, it's just...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Beautiful.

Wonderful.

MAN: Bead on Lloyd.

[Interposing voices]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Quiet and action!


Cut, cut.

MAN: That's a cut!


Yeah, it's a little sting.

A little sting.

But that's about it.

Now, this is no
explosion or nothing.

You're just going to pull
the plug on this, right?

Yeah, and blood's
gonna come out.

[Camera rolling]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Watch
your hands in the cup.

Back off.

Go ahead.

Throw it longer.

Ah, roll out.

Stop.

[Interposing voices]

MAN: Cut, cut!

INTERVIEWER: Oh, you're
just gonna pull it?

MAN: Pull it [inaudible]

INTERVIEWER: Blood goes off.

MAN: It looks like
he's get shot,

And then blood spreads out.

I mean, that's the plan.

MAN: [inaudible].

Ready.

Settle.

And action!

Look, we better do it again, and
just put some blood in there,

And get a shot of him.

Nothing came out.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
nothing came out.

WOMAN: It didn't go off.

Well, no.

There was no thing
that pulled it.

You know what I mean?

So they pulled the
plug out, and then it

Was supposed to blow through.

And it just didn't go.

It didn't happen.

MAN: And action!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Pump the blood.

Blood.

Blood, dying.

OK, good.

Good.

So I guess we ought
to be shooting

That way to begin with.

Get the crew [inaudible].

This area's gonna
have to be cleaned,

Because the movie people
would be shooting this way.

WOMAN: Excuse me.

I'm leaving today at 2:30.

That's why we're
shooting this way.

I don't know if you
were aware of it.

I'm aware of it.
And you know what?

Instead of starting
at the beginning,

We're gonna shoot this way, so
we can get... get your lines.

So everyone's back
behind this line.

And it all... all are yapping.

And then Benjamin says, are
you doing the revisions again?

Right?

Take it up to there.

And then once
Benjamin goes in here,

I think the other
guys probably will

Start moving forward a bit.

Oh, the other thing is we've
got to make sure... since Will's

Been put into all this
horrendous makeup,

That we get to a lot of stuff.

We've got to knock off
a lot of this dialogue.

But while we're
shooting this way,

This stuff should be
moved to that side, right?

Mm-hm.

And that way, also, Andy
has to leave at 2:30.

So, uh... Jesus.

Fuckin' [inaudible].

like Casey's trying to kill

Us all with a homemade bomb.
Yeah, I think it's a mistake.

I think you've got
to stay over there.

You know?

Or in other words, you
gotta stay in limbo,

Because at 2:30... I think
we've got to isolate you,

So that... you know what I mean?

Since you're leaving,
we've got to keep shooting.

So I think you should stay
over near that gas tank.

You know what I mean?
Just...

Just bye, y'all.


No, no.

Come over... Come closer.

Come closer.

Please, hurry up.

Listen, you won't
get any lines in.

You've got 10 minutes
to shoot your stuff.

MAN: Action!


MAN: Stay there, stay there.

Carl, go on.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

MAN: Roll out.

That's cut.

[Cheers and applause]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Bravo.

Pick up on the vomit.

[Loud motor running]

MAN: Turn it off!



LLOYD KAUFMAN: You gotta turn it
off when we say to turn it off.

MAN: Quiet, please.
WOMAN: We couldn't hear you.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Stand
by for a rehearsal.

WOMAN: Woo-hoo!

Could you have loved me if you
knew I had (SNIFFLING) these?

[Wails shrilly]

Can someone else
read the lines?

MAN: Aw, shit, dude, you got
your ass kicked by a chick.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut it, cut it.

Sarah, you gotta read lines.

SARAH: I'm sorry, I thought he
was gonna make barfing noises.

Oh, oh, I didn't
want to go over that.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: All
right, shut up!

And just read the lines.

Cut that slate in.

Let's go.
Well, hold it.

Wait a minute.

All right, let's
cut for a minute.

Actually, why don't
you... why don't

You kids... while
we're rehearsing,

You kids go over there.

Sorry.

I'm sorry.

Just go over there
while we're rehearsing.

MAN: Wear those earplugs.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Be
careful, though.

All right?
Just stand over there.

Don't listen.


I'm sorry, folks.

I apologize.

There's laws about this.

MAN: Action.

MAN: No, don't rub it.

Uh, OK, you don't have
two nails [inaudible].

OK?
Fingernails?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Not 'sposed to.
Nope.

Show the dick.

MAN: Uh, Sarah...

SARAH: Yeah, 58.

MAN: Do we have

INTERVIEWER: So
Lloyd, have you worked

With miniatures in other films?

Yes, I've worked with
miniatures in other films.

In fact, this film is no change.

Brains of the production
staff is miniature.

Detectives, uniformed
policemen sleeping.

Yo, we had talked.

We don't have them.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: We don't them.

Why didn't we call someone?


WOMAN: Uh-oh.

You guys... someone's gotta...
You have to read the script.

Right?
I-I...

What I'm talking
about is neither

Of you guys read the script.

Neither of you guys
looked at the call sheet.

So why didn't you do that?

Go up and down the line.

They're actually
mentioned in the script.

You know, I only
concentrated on the big

Nose and the stuff that's...

That's the other one.

But that means you
didn't read the script.

You're the AD.
No, I did.

I did.

And I broke it down.

And when I broke it down, I
underlined each character.

And I just missed the
word "cops" there.

MAN: OK.
You have to be more thorough.

MAN: So the plan is
to do it tomorrow?

No, let's get them out here.
Let's get 'em here.

We'll do a cut-away.

MAN: The police officer
should be wearing

A professional officer's
outfit, or can we

Use a guard at the gate?

The guard at the gate
might be able to look

Like a police officer.

Don't we have costumes here?

It's supposed to
be Mike and Wendy.

Mike and Wendy.

Those guys, the running...
The guys who are running.

One is in uniform,
and one isn't.

Wendy has her uniform, right?

MAN: Yeah.

She's getting into it now.

Bring her and the other guy
who's supposed to be Mike.

Fuck, Adam.

Come on, man.

You guys ought to be
reading the script, too.

Mike is the guy who
questions this, right?

Is his costume here?

He's supposed to be in uniform.

That's the point.

Well, is his costume here?

Then someone should wear
it, whatever his costume is.

It's not.

That's what... it was a
suggestion just to use a guard,

Because we weren't sure if that
would be an acceptable double.

That was the only
question [inaudible].

Mike is a guy.

Just put anybody in Mike's suit.

Cover his head.

MAN: OK, that's
what we're doing.

Please.

The guard is a
big, fat guy with...

And I think he's
black on top of it.

Mike is a... you know
what Mike looks like.

You rehearsed with him.

MAN: Yup, I remember.

MAN: How we doin'?

MAN: We've been informed
that the cop now

Has his uniform with him.

So we [inaudible].

Which cop do you have?

We have the female cop in
her uniform ready to go.

You said "his."

Use the male pronoun.

OK.

Himself.

So all right.

So Wendy's in costume.

She's heading this way.

Yes, exactly.

And the other guy, do
we have his costume?

No, the other guy
is not only not here,

But we don't have his costume.

So we wanted to [inaudible]
possibly use a guard...

No!

It's gotta look like the other
guy, whatever he's gonna wear.

Ask Stephanie, what is the
other guy gonna be wearing?

MAN: She just told me it
was going to be his uniform,

Which he was bringing with him.

A-ha.

So then bring... then
let's try the guard.

MAN: OK.

And have him cover
his... oh, does Stephanie

Have another cop outfit?

Supposedly not.

That's what we're
gonna [inaudible].

LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.

Well then just see if the guard
is willing to come and do it.

I'm sorry.
All right.

[Helicopter flying overhead]

But Adam, Michael...
Michael is not... Michael

Is not wearing the suit.

He's actually going to be
wearing a policeman outfit.

Yes.
That's what I was informed.

OK.
So then let's use the guard.

Sure.
That'd be fine.

Freeze!

And don't move either!

Come on in there.

Joe's got a live one.

Hurry up, hurry up.

Don't move.

Don't move.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: He's dead.

It's been dead.

This is the end of the movie.

We're just going to
do that little piece,

So we can get to
the fire, I guess.

MAN: OK.

OK.

So we're starting off
with the farting PA piece.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Tell
everybody to start in close.

And then as Fart
Boy comes through,

Everybody goes back,
because they know there's

A dangerous situation coming.

We're in the
fuckin' pickle here.

We're in the fuckin'... we're
never gonna finish this thing.

INTERVIEWER: So what have we
been waiting for right now?

I'm waiting to squeeze a fart
out of this PA and burn, baby.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't do the...

MAN: Oh, no.

MAN: (DISGUSTED) Oh.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: That was good.

MAN: Come on, let's do it.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Was
there a prop, underwear?

No, that's his real underwear.

Those are those skid marks.

INTERVIEWER: Oh, boy.


MAN: OK, we're just
doing a fire test now.

MAN: The test is good.

MAN: OK, that's it for the test.

And picture is next.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, now let's
position the pipe if we can...

MAN: Yeah, go ahead.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I've got it.

Out.

MAN: Can we wrap?

MAN: Let me see.

Uh, I still see it.

So bring your ass...
No, lower your ass.

Bring your ass in, so
that I see the pipe.

Well, you gotta
bring your ass up.

Up.

MAN: All right, you've got
about 30 seconds [inaudible].

MAN: There.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: There we go.

MAN: Take one, please.

Here we go.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Thank you, Greg.


MAN: a little bit more
this direction, please.

Yeah, that's it.
Good.

Thank you.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Gotta go.

MAN: Here we go.
Role count by A.


MEN: B.

MAN: Role count with B.

MAN: B.

MAN: Ready and...

[Interposing voices]

Action.

Stand... all right, stand by.

MAN: Let's see the pipe.

Up!

Ready.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

MAN: Let's see the pipe.

MAN: Action, fire!

Cut the fire.

Hey, hey.

Hanging in there?

MAN: Woo-woo-woo!

MAN: Aw, hey.

Hey, my friend.

How you doin'?

Hangin' in there?
I'm good.

I'm... I'm here.
We're hanging in there.

We're waiting to set
you on fire, though.


INTERVIEWER: Tell me who
Will's stunt double is.

Bobby Sanders.

INTERVIEWER: Is... and
then point to him.

Is Will's stunt double.

INTERVIEWER: That is
Will's stunt double.

Dead ringer.

Where's Will?

Do you love me, too?

Do you see?

Do you care?

Rocky?

INTERVIEWER: So those...
The pants you're wearing

Are fire retardant or no?

Yeah, these are fire retardant
pants and a fire retardant top.

Fire retardant, uh,
head piece as well.

The actual vest that
I'm gonna be using

Is gonna be fire
retardant as well.

And I'm gonna have the
Nomex gel all over my body.

INTERVIEWER: What is that?

BOBBY SAMUELS: The Nomax gel?

It's a fire retardant type gel.

It keeps the fire off of
me, so I don't get hot.

INTERVIEWER: So what are some
things you have to, like,

Focus on when you're
going this stunt?


No big movements at all,
because big movements...

I move the wrong way
like this, and flames

Would whip from around my
back, and whip up to my face.

And there's a chance that I
could [sniffs] inhale fire.

So you gotta be very careful.

INTERVIEWER: How many of
these have you done before?

Uh, this is my third one.

INTERVIEWER: Still exciting?

Of course.

INTERVIEWER: Is this just a
precautionary bed or something?

Yeah, just precaution.

INTERVIEWER: OK, good.

[Interposing voices]

MAN: [inaudible] same clothes,
same build, same skin color.

INTERVIEWER: I
know, it's perfect.

MAN: Rolling.

MAN: B.

MAN: Roll Camera B.

MAN: B.

MAN: B.

MAN: Set and action!

You're up, kid.

Go.


MAN: Go down.

Ah!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut, cut, cut.

MAN: That's a cut, that's a cut.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
the stunt was harrowing.

I was so worried about
the man in the afro,

The guy in the afro with...

The little candle on his back.

Tiny, little... yeah.


Plus, I love the way the stunt
guys are all like cowboys.

You know?
OK, get ready, ready.

MAN: The testosterone

What was it?
OK?

You're up, kid, go.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Getting all pumped up.

And then the next thing...
It's like this little flame

About this big.

And then the guy... and
the wig was an afro, too.

That was hilarious.

There was also a wonderful piece
of you with the wall of fire

That was like... I mean,
a lot of it looked phony,

But there was one two-second
piece where, I mean,

You really look... and your
acting was great, too.

And it really looked like
you were engulfed in fire.

MAN: That was kinda fun.

MAN: And action!

MAN: [wails]

MAN: Be still, though,
with your face.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Line?

I just wanted to get laid.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again
with the flame a little lower.

MAN: A little lower.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: But the wall of
fire thing worked very good.

MAN: Action!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Keep going.

Go again!

Can you do another blast?

All right.

MAN: Another blast is good?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut, I
think we're all right.

Your makeup is horrible.

Horrifying.

MAN: Yeah.

That was, uh... I could just
tell... when I walked out

There and I saw everyone like...

Go-od.

That just stopped
me in my tracks.

Ruth, that looks great.

And your face
looks all misshapen

'Cause of the [inaudible].

MAN: You look like one of
those ghouls that came out

Of the graveyard in "Thriller."


Hermaphrodite.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, my god.

Shit, mon.

MAN: That's a nice one, too.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: What
the heck is that thing?

It's from that shit.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What is that?

It looks like...
It's glue.

I've tried baby oil.

I've tried... I
mean, it'll come off

The next time I have to get...

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Well, I'll tell ya,

That scene was... that
was a disturbing makeup.

I mean... I mean now that you're
out of it, [inaudible] dead.

MAN: You know, I never
got to see myself.

So I could look
down and see that.

But I never got to
look in the mirror.

So it would be a
nice surprise for me.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was
pretty [inaudible].

Oh, Jesus, it was disturbing.

MAN: We're picking
it up here from when

Moose goes in with the knife
and continuing through.

The whole thing with the dousing
and the lasso, [inaudible].


Doing the lasso stuff.

All that's happening now.

Everyone's running
in, doing our actions.

So let's set up.

Let's have everybody in place.

INTERVIEWER: What are
we waiting for here?

[Makes explosion noise]

This is where we're gonna blow
up... this is... I get blown up.

I know.

I've got to get
blown up later on.

WOMAN: Why are you wearing
a nice shirt with jeans?

Because this shirt
gets... I needed three.

They needed three exact
shirts to get blown up.

And this dummy's going
to wear the shirt,

So it can't be short-sleeved.

It can't be... so I have to
have long sleeves, you see?

MAN: It's very simple.

You're either going
to have a dummy flying

Through the air in
pieces, or you're

Going to have a fireball.

One or the other, right?

Yeah, because if you can't
blow the dummy up, right,

Like, blow it in pieces
and see it if it's

In the middle of a fireball.

MAN: Because it just
won't be visible.

MAN: Right.

So you have to decide if you
want to do a dummy blowing up

In the air, like,
in pieces with just

Some smoke and sparkle inside.

Or you want to have a
fireball around the dummy.

There's a possibility
you won't see anything

Except for this fireball.

And then it'll be
now you see it,

Now you don't kind of thing.

MAN: Yeah.

MAN: What we're doing is
we're making a device that'll

Save the camera from
getting any kind of debris

Or any kind of flame
exposure to this explosion

That we're going
to be doing today.

Now you might want
to cover your ears.

It's going to be very loud.

MAN: Fire in the hole.

MAN: And action!


Holy shit.

[Applause and cheers]

The best explosion
in Troma history.

Awesome.

That was well worth the wait.

That was...

MAN: Charlotte, how
does it feel now

That your father was blown up?

I feel very proud of him.

I fee like he really, you know,
risked his life for the camera.

MAN: [laughs]

Big explosion.

Larry Benjamin jumps on top.

Boom!

And then all of a
sudden, it's raining Ben.

Hallelujah.

It was amazing.

We were pleasantly surprised.

Everything on this movie
so far has been sort of how

We deal with disappointment.

And that was one thing that
lived up to our expectations

And possibly exceeded them.

So I'm very happy
with the explosion.

Bits of Lloyd flew everywhere.

This was tremendous
gratification.

I think I'm gonna
get a loop tape of it

And just roll it over
and over and over again.

Jesus.

Look, it blew him
out of the sneakers.

Damn.

Or did they go up and fall?

Yeah, what...

No, he...

sneakers at all?

No, the sneakers
were, like, attached.

It's just I don't think not
too well, and just [inaudible].


Blew the body out
of the sneakers.

It's beautiful, man.

Blew himself out of the Nikes.

WOMAN: These are my sneakers.

MAN: It's, mm, almost 10:00.

We have a lot of
scenes to shoot.

It's our first
day in New Jersey.

We're planning to pack in
all these people over here.

MAN: Plus all these people
that are in the car.


MAN: It's been a
hectic first day.

And considering after we worked
on scene 58 for three days

Straight, this is
a welcome change.

Hopefully, we will get
there and we won't all

Get yelled at too much.

Anyone from the Art department?

It's supposed to be a movie set.

MAN: Art department...

Now, we need movie props
like cameras and things.

And we need to get actors.

We need to get the
running group, right?

So [inaudible] should be in it.

MAN: I'll get the cover.

WOMAN: Front camera?

Thanks.

is... was wrongly scheduled.

And that it's too
big, and it should've

Been put some other time.

We're gonna be here forever.

And Lloyd is this
close to blowing up.

[Explosion noise]

It looks like he wants
to go in that direction.

Let's start getting
people moving around.

It's after the bathroom,
right? [Inaudible].

Meanwhile, the background
is being organized.

The sound man is listening.

So when we give
him a [inaudible],

He'll have some ideas.

You have any idea when they're
going to get to me tonight?

INTERVIEWER: I do not know.

We're trying to bang
out a lot of shots.

You're definitely
getting your shot in.

Well, if it's not done today,
I mean, I'm not going to be...

I can't be here tomorrow.

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hold it.

Where's the sound guy?

Get the sound guy
here, and watch this.

Where is the sound man?


I gave up a whole day's
work of money for nothing?

I mean, they called me
for 9:00 this morning.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Working
on backgrounds,

We're gonna have this
huge thing happening now.

It's all developing.

If you could shut
up and organize it,

The natural course
will take over

And we'll get a good scene.

So let's just keep working.

Everyone concentrate.

I took a day off from work.

Then they tell me it's 10:00.

Then they tell me it's 12:00.

And then they tell me it's 2:00.

And [inaudible].

And I can't stay... and I'm
not staying till 11:00 either.

I got to get up tomorrow
morning and go to work.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right, folks.

This is beautiful.

Action.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: You're about 10
minutes too late there, Neve.

The minute she turns
to move, get in there.

Goddammit.

Can people listen, please?

And Adam, you listen
and translate.

Because obviously, I'm not
speaking the same language.

So just translate.

Speak their... whatever
they're talking.

ADAM: They didn't hear you.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Sorry.

I'm sorry.

It's just she was doing
the same goddamn thing.

Otherwise, I'm on air
here for 10 minutes.

No purpose on the dolly.

We're setting up
the beautiful thing.

[Interposing voices]

Don't do this!

Don't do anything
like that, dammit!

It's taking that energy
away from over here.

Don't do anything!

It's a very complicated shot.

If this were in a Hollywood
studio, you'd be here for weeks

Doing it.

up one fucking shot like this.

Don't do anything that
pulls away from the energy.

See what she's
doing right there?

Stop.

Just everybody, let
this thing happen.

Ready?

MAN: Slate in.
Roll sound.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't fight it.

Do not fight it.

Flow with it.

MAN: Mark.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Part of the dao.

Ready?

MAN: Ready.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

Have you seen Christine?

Uh, yeah.

I think she went outside
to, uh, practice her lines.

Fresh air improves memory.

I knew that.

Everybody thinks
I don't know shit.

DJ knows shit.

Ma, I drip like a leaky
faucet for that guy.

No.

MAN: Hey, coffee?

I already have two.

Aw, shit!

Fuckin' hot!

Oh-oh, it hurts, doesn't it?

Well, maybe it
wouldn't hurt so bad

If there wasn't so much of it?

You see, when I send you to
get cups, I mean small ones.

We use small cups, so people
don't leave huge, full cups

Of coffee lying around.

You understand?

Now, what's the
rather painful lesson

To be learned here today?

Uh, small cups.

Good.

Remember next time.

Switch to fuckin' decaf.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

Beautiful.

OK.

MAN: We got to do that again.
MAN: Adam.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right, quiet!
Quiet!

MAN: Quiet, please, guys.

We need [inaudible].

JOE FLEISHAKER: Why did they
have to change the schedule

And not do my scene?

I don't know the reasons.

But the reasons did not
deal with... did not consider

My concerns and my needs.

So what am I 'sposed to do?

Give up my job, not
do my regular job?

Not go to work tomorrow?

I can't come and be
here till midnight.

MAN: We're not
planning on keeping

You anywhere past 10:00.

Right now it is a
quarter past 7:00.

OK.

MAN: We're knocking off
a quick scene with Lloyd.

And then we're planning
on shooting your scene.

Oh, that's... well,
nobody told me that.

I'm hearing people getting
ready to do other scenes.

MAN: You're busy yelling.

Well, maybe.

But I wasn't yelling until
you came over to talk to me.

All I hear is that you're
threatening to leave.

I have to leave set in
the middle of a scene

To come back here and tell you
that I want you in this movie?

I was just concerned that it
seemed like other scenes were

Being pushed and pushed and
pushed in between after I

Already [inaudible].

And I just can't be pushed later
and later and later, because I

Have to get out of here.

And as you well know, I
have my limitations, too.

I get out of here
at 12:00 tonight,

I'm not going to be able
to work on time tomorrow.

We can do your scene as quickly
or as slowly as we need to.

Well, [inaudible]
is not a problem.

Because I want the scene to
come out right [inaudible].

I'm not walking out [inaudible].

Will made the midget cry.

MAN: You wanna do the last,
full rehearsal, Lloyd?

Is Jim leaving?

Are you splitting?

OK, thanks.

I want him to put Theo's
makeup kit on his head,

So she had some leverage.

MAN: Oh, you don't want
to be in the scene?

You don't want to
be in this film?

MAN: Well, this is just kind of
a... it is the making of a film.

So there's, like,
behind the scenes.

Yeah.


MAN: You're not digging it?

Not really.

I'll come see it.

MAN: All right.

Good luck.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Dead cow?

MAN: So guys, can we have
everyone here, please?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: He
doesn't have to change!

He doesn't have to change!

Just get the one guy out, and
get Michael to lie down here.

And get the cow head!

INTERVIEWER: Like, what
kind of acting technique

Do you encourage?

Meisner, Stanislavski method,
for the average actor person?

I don't.

I think I just let them take
over and do their own thing.

We did have a scene yesterday
with one of our production

Assistants named Joey.

He played a part
on the film, and...

Just come in.

Just do your entrance, right?

You know the line?

[Interposing voices]

I, of course, had to get
the performance out of him.

So...

[Interposing voices]

MAN: Everyone's very quiet.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action, Joey!

[Whooshing noise]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh,
you're smiling.

What am I doing?

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Just come in oh, he

Doesn't know what he's doing?

[Interposing voices]

Did anybody give him the line?

Benjamin's first rule.

[Interposing voices]

OK.

But you understand, you're just
like trying to put him out.

He's on fi... he's on fire,
and you're [inaudible].

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Just come in.

Just do your entrance, right?

And action!

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

OK.

Let's go back here.

And the Oscar goes to...


LLOYD KAUFMAN: I felt the best
way to do it was to just yell

And scream, and...

Just get fuckin'
serious, fuckin' scared.

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

Do it.
Ready?

Benjamin's first...
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't.

You're smiling.
You're smiling.

Benjamin's first rule
of production, safety...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Enunciate.
Ready?

Wait for action.

And... don't smile.

If you smile, you can eat
someone else's dinner.

You ready?

Ready?

And action.

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Bigger.

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: But

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

OK.

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

Keep... you gotta keep
the thing going, right?

Here we go.

Once more.

Action!

Benjamin's first
rule of production.

Safety to humans.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

And then you'll run off.

Again.

Ready?

No stupidity now. [Inaudible].

Go back.
Do it again.

Again.
You still don't have it.

You know, I'll yell out
at him every... right

Before every take, act, act,
act, act, act, act, act, act!

Now everybody else
stop stupidity.

Right?
Just everyone close, please.

You guys just don't do anything.
Right?

He's got to concentrate.
MAN: OK, quiet.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Now
start acting, Joey!

Here we go.

Ready?

Action!

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

But you have to keep
the energy going, right?

Safety to humans!

Right?

You've seen cartoons, right?

Yeah.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Go.

Do it like that, right?

Ready?
Again.

Back [inaudible].
MAN: Quiet, please.

Here we go.
Reset.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Start acting.

Come on.

Ready?

Standing by.

Action!

No, you're smiling
when you come in.

You're not smiling.

You gotta act.

Otherwise, please.

Do the acting.

Action.

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Safety to humans.

But keep it going.

You're doing, safety to humans.

And you don't want to be...
Or no, I want-

WOMAN: You're going
to go... you're

Gonna go and put the fire out.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hold the emotion.

Hold the emotion.
Right?

WOMAN: I know, but...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready.

Action!

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, that's it.

Now pull the thing out.
Pull the thing out.

Shh...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: What's
so fuckin' funny?

You're losing light, and
the guy isn't acting.

Come on.

You... you gotta keep
in character right now.

We'll do one more
rehearsal for focus.

Action!

Act!

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

But... now, why did
you look over there?

Why did you look
over to this guy?

Because the action is back here.

You started looking over here,
and then you looked, like,

Over there as if somebody
was summoned there to... you

Know what I mean?
JOEY: Yeah.

I... I guess I had a [inaudible].

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Look
in the same spot.

Look at this man in the glasses.

Or look at my hands.

See where my hand is?

OK.

So just be looking there,
and then you'll go off frame.

Ready?

OK.

Start some smoke.

MAN: Let's start
the smoke, please.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Here
we go, everybody.

MAN: Scene 58x,
number one, take one.

MAN: Smokin'!

[Motor running]

MAN: Wrong sound!

[Motor stops]


MAN: Mark it.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans!


LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK.

MAN: Cut!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Very good.

All right.

That's sort of how I
did the Joey technique.

And indeed, he acted.

But that's because he had not
really been acting very much.

Also, I don't know who's
in charge of casting.

But somebody should have
gotten a decent actor to play

That part yesterday, right?

We shouldn't be putting
actors in these parts

Unless they can act.

There's a shitload
of actors out there.

Anybody could've done it
except for that kid, Joey.

But now that he's in it,
we gotta keep him going.

We have to keep him...
Tying him into this thing.

Can you make sure
that Joey is here.

He's supposed to be
in this next scene.

Is here today?

No, Andy... she said
she found a new monkey.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hey, cut, cut.

Why are you standing up?

WOMAN: Did you want
Joey saying something?

Just...
No.

WOMAN: No?
Joey?

No, he should just be there.

Joey should be there, huh?

That's my big break.

I'm gonna fucking shoot myself.

Let's go see the shit.

Yeah, we were talking about
the shit in the costume.

I think we should just place
the costume on top of the guy

And pretend... like,
let's say instead

Of putting the shit in your
pants, just you would be naked.

Well, you'd be in
your underpants.

You'd lie down on the ground.

You'd put the shit on your ass.

Big pile of shit.

And then we'd gently lay
the costume on top of you

Like a blanket.

And then we'd just sort of
like pretend it was coming off.

INTERVIEWER: Is it good?

Nope.

Action!

Line?

This isn't chocolate...

This isn't chocolate pudding.

ALL: Oh!

This isn't chocolate pudding.

ALL: (DISGUSTED) Oh.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!







This is so disgusting.

[Dry heaves]

It just shows that it's
worth it for Troma.

getting at least $1 million.




Yeah-he-ha, Troma!

[Dry heaves]

The shit I go through
to make art for Troma.

I love it.


Lloyd, in terms of having some
juicy scenes tomorrow, right?

Yeah, we should
get into the juice.

Do the PA getting
his legs cut off?

Yeah.

And the guy's face being
melted by the light.

That's like two
fairly... I mean, they're

Not long scenes, but the
effects and stuff, right?

Sure, do 'em.

You need a place where
you can dig a hole,

Because the person has to be
there and sitting in the hole

With his legs down below.

Now, maybe there's a
place like right over...

Oh, I see.

And then his legs
have got to be buried.

So you bury... what you do
is when you bury his legs...

I need to figure out
somewhere outside, right?

You're going
to have the stumps.

You're going to have,
like, the stumps.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I understand that.

Totally.

Totally done this before.

Legs chopped off [inaudible].

Now, hold it.

If you could just find some
grass where I [inaudible].

And then have them dig a hole.

But unfortunately, we need the
trucks to be able to... it's got

To be the same kind of ground
that the trucks can come back...

Or that cars can...

Wonderful.

INTERVIEWER: What'd
you just do there?

You... you just found the, uh...

That's where the squashing
Edward [inaudible].

So it starts off
you're scanning

The area for hazards, right?

You're, like, looking around.

The crew's looking
around over here, too.

They're a little dispersed.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: On these
Troma, you ought to always

Have some blood on set.

OK.

Let's just finish this off.

So the trucks are coming in.

He finishes his speech.

And wham, bam!

He's cut in half.

He's down on the ground now.

And members of the crew jump up.

MAN: And there's that line.

That's when the
crew will disperse.

A couple of people will
go to the front of the van

To see who's driving 'em.

And then...

MAN: Who's going [inaudible]?
And then...

MAN: Call 911.
[airplane flying overhead]

And then these two lines.

Yeah, yeah, your lines.

Why you... you guys
gotta continue the fight

For truly independent cinema!

Ugh!

MAN: Somebody call 911.

MAN: 911, 911!
MAN: Let's cut.

MAN: Thank you very much.

And God bless you.

MAN: So folks, we can go ahead
and head back to holding.

We're going to bring
you out in a little bit

When we do the reversal and we
see the legs... the [inaudible]

For the legs.


Everyone can go
except the asshole PA.

MAN: Go ahead, roll it.

MAN: Rolling B, three, two, one!

MAN: Fuckin' yeah-heah!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut!

Go forward, John.

MAN: Oh!


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut

MAN: Got it.
MAN: Cut!

Good.

[Cheers and applause]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right, get
out of there, you schmuck.

[Interposing voices]

MAN: So folks, we need to be
very aware of this hole right

Here.

Everyone, be very
careful, please.

Very careful.

MAN: OK, let's let our actor in.

MAN: You could stand up
like using your feet.

Um, yeah.

MAN: No, we could
put some boards

Underneath to put your feet on.

feet are hanging now.

MAN: Light, please!

WOMAN: I got him cardboard.

MAN: Oh, nice.

MAN: So folks, I
just want everyone...

MAN: Oh, sorry.

WOMAN: Gonna get in there?

WOMAN: Yeah.

MAN: This is freaking
me the fuck out.

WOMAN: How come?
What's it like?

I don't know.

I'm just... I'm in
another world right now.

I'm fucking gone, baby.

WOMAN: Are you, really?

Does it feel like it
could be real, what

It would be like in Vietnam?

This is why I'm a vegetarian.

That.

Ew!

MAN: Go quiet.
We're rolling sound.

We're rolling.
MAN: Mark.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

[Shouting and screaming]

MAN: First of all, everyone
did a great job there,

And you guys all
need to be applauded.

Thank you for your cooperation.

It went off very well.

OK.

So now here's what's going on.

We're going on to 38D
with all you guys.

Guys, all right.

First of all, we need it quiet.

Second of all, here's
what's going on.

We're doing the dance
up until the fall.

So let's keep it quiet,
and we're gonna rehearse.

What should the dance be?

What should he do
when [inaudible]?

Basically...

Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Right.

And he should do,
like, the thing.

Do a little electrocuting,
you know, a little of that.

And then you should
be doing like this,

You know, like
high... high thing.

You know?

And you're almost
trying to take it off.

And then go into
the... that stuff.

OK?

Yeah.

Can you squirt the
smoke inside the lens?

All right.

Let's roll.


MAN: We are rolling.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Rolling!

MAN: Rolling!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready and action.

[Makes strangled noises]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Whoa.
Don't break it.

Gentle.
Gentle.

Come back the other way.

Come back the other way.

Whoa, gentle, gentle, gentle.

MAN: Relax a little more.

Good job.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Dance.
Just move your legs.

MAN: Make him go
down on his knees.

Yeah.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No, no.

Get up, get up, get up.

MAN: Ted, you've got to get
on the fuckin' [inaudible].

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Get up, get up.
Go to your right.

To your right, to your left.
Your left.

A little more.

Move your feet but don't
move your head a lot.

OK.
Action.

Cut.
Good.

MAN: Nice.

MAN: You should do it...
The thing broke, man.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I'm
not doing it again.

You kidding?

Just get the thing on his head
and have him dance around.

MAN: Yeah.

Don't smoke.

It's bad for your skin.

That's gotta feel
funky in your ears.

MAN: Bring him up more,
or you like where that is?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Looks
good here for me.

MAN: OK.

If you like it, we
could keep that.

MAN: Here we go.

And roll sound.


LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Camera, the camera.

Camera, goddammit.
Action!

MAN: Action!

MAN: Move out of the way!

[Interposing voices]

WOMAN: Lift him up.
Move him up.

MAN: Nice.

Lift him up.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Lift him up.

MAN: Nice.

MAN: Oh!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut, cut, cut.

Give Steven a cigarette.

MAN: Yeah.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: They won't
need any, because they

Don't want to get super-slimed.

All they have to do is... I've
been saying it for six weeks.

Super slime.
Super... it's in my book.

It's everywhere.

They don't want to do it.

We're gonna shoot this
head blowing up with about

Four feet of detonation cord.

MAN: Yeah, well, these are...

MAN: Those are the explosives
that trigger the det cord.

You attach a squib
here on each end,

Push that yellow button there.

MAN: [inaudible].

MAN: B!

MAN: Ready!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: And action!


MAN: That's a cut.

Nobody move.

Everyone stay on set, please.

Stand by.

MAN: Don't move.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's go on.

It looked very nice.

MAN: OK, let's move on.

The explosion was a lot...
Was a lot more intense than...

You had first [inaudible].

Yeah, yeah.

OK, great.

You can shoot it.

MAN: Ready and roll
camera A. And action!



LLOYD KAUFMAN: Beautiful.

[Cheers and applause]

They're gone!

INTERVIEWER: Can you
tell me about the scene

That... your big scene today?

Well, I'm going to be in a head
cast and in my boxer shorts.

There's an emergency on set,
and I get up and I run naked.

This is the day, man.

We're gonna get to
see Yaniv's rocket.

Yeah, baby!

All right.

Here we go.

Let's go.

MAN: Quiet, please.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

Action!


Cut!

MAN: Yeah, Yaniv!

[Applause and cheers]

INTERVIEWER: What can you
tell me about baring it all?

Very liberating but
it ain't over yet.

I got to run to 42nd Street
now, Times Square, baby.

MAN: The whole world will be
familiar with the geography...

Big Apple!

Of your gonads, my friend.

YANIV SHARON: Yeah!

Yes, Yaniv.

We're filming in
the street tomorrow.

INTERVIEWER: Yeah?

In, like, Times Square?

Yeah, the guy's going
to run through Times

Square with no clothes on.

INTERVIEWER: Yaniv,
how are feeling today?

Nervous as hell, y'all.

Nervous as hell.

It's all right.

It's all right, though.

It's gonna be a good scene.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Should be a
wide shot of this Times Square.

And Yaniv... it should be empty.

And Yaniv's butt
should come into frame.

And he bumps into
that post there.

Go ahead.

No.
Stop.

Goddammit!

Here.

Just do what I do.

Watch.

You come in here, and you
do like this. [Inaudible].

Just do like that. [Inaudible].

It's all moving very tight here.

MAN: Very quiet.

Very quickly.

MAN: And ready?

Here we go, folks.

Ready and Brendan, set?

BRENDAN: Yeah.

MAN: And action on rehearsal!


MAN: He stopped on his own
in the middle of the shot.

So what?

Don't have Edward
talk to them, right?

Just leave it alone.

The guy doesn't know
where the camera is.

See?
Now you got an angry guy.

He's never gonna leave.

Just let the guy alone.

Let him walk, and get him
out of the fucking picture.

MAN: So we might as well give
him holes for him to look.

MAN: You don't see
the front of him.

We just see his ass.

Did you know that
guy wasn't an extra?

No.

I didn't see him.

Out of nowhere, I
just... just bang.

MAN: Oh, man.

It's fucked up.

MAN: All right,
I'm ready to shoot.

MAN: Roll camera.

Yeah!

Out!

Action!



MAN: That's a cut.

[Cheers and applause]

We gotta... they're gonna... you
have to wrap it up for today.

They're not gonna let
him shoot anymore here.

And that's about it.

When I got there...
They called action.

And I just ran.

I did my thing, tried to
go as crazy as possible.

I hit the pole.

Then I zigzagged.

And I was running this way.

I was looking at... to
someone to run into.

But I couldn't... when
it was over, the whole

People applauded in me.

It felt great.

It's awesome.

MAN: Half straw.

Where could half straw be?

WOMAN: Who wants
this up their ass?


Not in my ass!

Dah!

Right?

And you do it, Jerry, OK?

OK.

You can just bring it... hit
the table and hit... you know?

OK?


Ah!

Dude!

My ass!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

MAN: Right.

So where are you gonna

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I think
that'd be right here.

Just kind of see a behind,
and the beautiful funnel.

And your behind [inaudible].

MAN: So this, too?

You feel this, too?

I mean, as much as we can
cheat that underneath, like,

Your ball sack or something.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
No, we gotta wedge

Towels in between his legs.

Or if you taped... so the
thing'll stay in place.

Whoa-oh.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
right there is good.

MAN: Pssh.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: On action.

WOMAN: You got a
thirsty ass, hey?



LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut, cut.

INTERVIEWER: Have you been
nude on film before, though?

Uh, nah... on stage.

There's not much call for
me to be nude on film.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Keep
it so it doesn't

Drip in his eyes, please.

For a first stab,
this looks good.

And ready?

MAN: Slate and roll sound.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: [inaudible]
you start screaming.

I'll tell you when to
withdraw the thing.

Roll.

Hip and scream!


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again
on that same other spot

For number one.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.
All right.

Good.
Hold, please.

MAN: Cap reloads.

INTERVIEWER: And his
brain's gonna fall

Out of that area on the top?

Um, she's gonna stab him.

And pull them out... reach
in and pull 'em out.

MAN: We got brains
in the Tupperware.


BRENDAN: You gotta
build something

To hold the head stiff.

MAN: Copy.

BRENDAN: It's unbelievable.

It's just common sense, man.

Yeah.

If you're [inaudible] you gotta
have something hard to stick

Underneath and hold onto.

WOMAN: All right, Brendan.

If you think you can do a better
job, then why don't you do it?

BRENDAN: This whole
head has no support.

It just collapses
like a balloon.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I think
that's the best we did.

MAN: Rolling.

MAN: And ready and action!

MAN: Cut.


MAN: OK, folks.

We should all be in
our first position.

I'm grabbing my balls and stuff
in our scene, can I improve?

Because it's like I... I...

Yeah, sure.

What is it that you don't like?

Well, it's just like
I'm trying to hit on her,

And there's no scene if she's
already grabbing my balls.

I just [inaudible].

Oh, I see.

So don't... do it the
other way around.

Do it?

Have her talk about
the fountain first.

She can grab my
balls after, do you

Live in the house, Toadster?

Yeah.

Hey!

Nice to see you, man.

Hey, nice to see you.

Hey, everybody.
MAN: [inaudible].

Quiet, please.
Quiet on set!

Hey!

Look who's here...
The great Ron Jeremy!


He's one of the principal
characters of this movie.

And remember, it's OK to
masturbate as long as it's

Not against your principle.

Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Come on.
Shut up.

Get out.

I want to keep working on this.

There goes the respect.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Quiet!

MAN: Quiet, please.

Quiet on set!
Where's the love?

Where's the romance?

All right.
Let's go.

We gotta rehearse.

I'm gonna take him to meet Ruth.

Right?

Ruth Pongstaphone.

We have to block this, so we
can see what the lighting is.

Get out of there, Catherine.

Get out!

Please, just wait.

Wait two minutes.

We're just blocking.
WOMAN: OK.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: This
is [inaudible] here.

I gotta do it.
So I'm not pleasant.

I'm sorry.

Ready?

MAN: We're standing
by for rehearsal.

Very quiet.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Where's the stunt guy?

Get Robby here.

Tell him to stay
fucking here, all right?

Uh, how's this feel?

Be able to take the
shoulder down this way.

INTERVIEWER: So have you
fallen down stairs before?

Yes.

INTERVIEWER: What are
some things you have

To do to not kill yourself?

Well, one thing is
what I'm doing now.

To allow myself the
freedom of movement.

If I didn't have this stuff on,
then I would fall cautiously.

And it would show on film.



LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ron.
Hi, Lloyd.

How's it going?
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

You look great.
Well, you look good yourself.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Thank you.
How's it going?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.
I have a question for you.

Shoot.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: In the
flashback, you sing a song.

I think it should
be "Amazing Grace."

You know?

When Casey comes
here... and I think

You should sing that same song.

"Amazing Grace."

Oh, the same thing
I sing [inaudible].

But now it's twisted,
because I have no tongue.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.
(SINGING) Amah-zing grace.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: But do
you know "Amazing Grace?"

No, but I'll learn it.

[Mumbles indechiperhably]


MAN: It's crunch time, baby.

You have 30 seconds to do this.

The cops won't let
us do it anymore.

We're, like, being
pulled as of, like, now.

So if we don't do this now
before the Sergeant comes back,

I'd say we're in deep shit.

They're gonna revoke
our license for good.

MAN: Two, one.

Back to first positions, please.

Everyone come on in.

People walking around and
then you'll [inaudible].

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Wait.
OK.

Excellent.

Keep the door open, so
you guys can come out.

Come out of there.

MAN: Yeah, go in there.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Go in
there and come out.

Ready?
Go in.

MAN: There, we're speeding.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Beautiful.

MAN: We're speeding still.

MAN: We have speed.

MAN: Ready, Lloyd?
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

I'm focused on them.

MAN: Mark it.

Yeah.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
And focus on them.

Action!

WOMAN: All right,
let him through.

Back up, ya muckrakers.

Outta the way!

Excuse me, sir.

I know this must be very painful
for you at a time like this.

But when did you
first realize your son

Was a body part-tickling
hermaphroditic lunatic?


COP: All right, that's it.
Back off!

Get outta the way!
Back up!

Back up!


MAN: That's a cut.

You got it?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Take photos.

Don't take the stuff off.

Everybody else get out.

MAN: Yeah, that's a wrap, folks.

We need everybody out of
the street and inside.

That is a wrap.

That's a wrap.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: I don't
know why [inaudible].

They tell me at the last
minute that... you know,

Rather than telling me at
the beginning of the day,

They tell me at the
last... like now,

Where we have to be
off by 8 o'clock.

Well, listen.

You guys have to tell me by
the beginning of the day,

You gotta be out by 8 o'clock.

Right?

Nobody told me...

MAN: This was supposed to
be a daytime shot, Lloyd.

It was marked as [inaudible].
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well, so what?

You gotta tell me that.

I don't... I'm assuming
I can shoot all day.

You guys have to say, boys,
your day ends at 8 o'clock,

Like it or not.

I would have been outta here.

I wouldn't... you know, I
could have quit other stuff.

I mean, I think we got it.

I'm going to go look at dailies.


MAN: It's not a
table or anything.

It's a hot set.

MAN: So nobody touches it,
especially [inaudible].

MAN: Folks, quiet down, please.

I could already be screaming
and yelling, all that stuff.

Just tell me how
much you need and...

MAN: Yeah.
MAN: We're gonna lift this...

MAN: Oh, Joe.

MAN: OK.

OK, here we go.

Edge, slate in.

Roll sound.
Speed.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Make it look
like you're chopping a tree, OK?

MAN: OK, [inaudible].
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

Ah, what are you doing to me?
Stop that!

Ah!
Ah!

Ah!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: [inaudible]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Pull him back.
Move forward now.

I can't.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut, cut.

Ah, man.

This is... my mouth
is [inaudible].

I'm gonna puke in a second.

[Interposing voices]
MAN: All right.

Let's get paper towels.

Let's get water on
the set right away.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Excellent, Joe.

I don't want it
dripping in my eyes.

MAN: It's just corn syrup.

I need it over my eyes.

Look, it's gonna
drip into my eyes.

MAN: There's no soap
or anything in it.

MAN: Just water and a napkin.

MAN: It won't hurt ya.

Don't worry.

MAN: Water's comin' in.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Look how nice.
Keep goin'.

Do it faster.

Wee!


Female blood wrestling.

That'd be great.

MAN: 170 on Camera A.

MAN: Yeah, don't chew 'em.
Just keep 'em there.

Right.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, that's it.

Just one more piece.
MAN: That's enough.

No.
MAN: Come on.

One more.

MAN: One more.

MAN: It's just bread.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, good.

All right.
Here we go.

[Whirring sound]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Keep
goin', keep goin'.

MAN: That's it.
Keep goin'.

Ah!
MAN: Good.

[Slicing noises]

Ah!


MAN: OK, everyone.
MAN: That's a cut!

Yeah!

[Cheers and applause]

MAN: Uh, Joe!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hello,
Joe Fleishaker!

[Cheers and applause]

Joe Fleishaker!

When you wanted to do this
part, I was skeptical.

That's right, that's right.

Very skeptical.

And now how do you feel?

Oh, I feel great.

I'm just wondering
if viewers satisfied

With the ultimate result?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: More
than satisfied.

JOE FLEISHAKER: I mean,
don't ask me today

Whether I'll do it again.

Wait a couple of weeks.

Well, this was the easy part.

Tomorrow you'll have to do your
own stunt down the escalator.

We forgot to tell you that.

You have to actually
fall down the escalator.

Oh, well, then I don't
have to wash this stuff off.


I need a paper
towel for my eyes.

I'm about to go blind.

I am not going to be
able to wash my back,

And wash my... you know,
get rid of the [inaudible].

So...
WOMAN: Yeah.

OK.

When I'm at home,
I use a brush,

Because I'm just a big guy.

[Interposing voices]

I refuse to clean up today.

MAN: Again.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.

Let them out, folks.

MAN: Come on.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Come on out.

Thank you so much.

MAN: DVD, stop rolling camera.

No, because I can't
reach everywhere anyway.

So just wanted to give me
a wipe-down [inaudible].

Ben, can you help me?

Can somebody help me or what?

MAN: What do you need?

Yeah, can you help me?

MAN: Is it that much bloo...

JOE FLEISHAKER: Just get
Gabe in here or something.

He can do it, if you
don't mind, to help out.

MAN: I ain't doing anything
with the underwear.

MAN: Feet... tape on his feet.

Could you get the
other tape off?

MAN: I need, like, a knife.

Oh-ho-ho.

Yeah, I'm about to
slide off this chair.




LLOYD KAUFMAN: Eh,
Adam, is there any way

To get all these actors who
are gonna be in the... you know,

They haven't even
picked up Lemmy.

Lemmy's going to be done with...

They left to pick
up Lemmy already.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
because I told them to.

So we're gonna go pick
Lemmy up at 5 o'clock.

This is the most
horrible, horrible

Group I've ever... horrible.

Horrible.

I'm trying to
rehearse this thing

Or we're going to
be here all night.

I'm getting
absolutely... you know,

I'm running around
doing everything.

All right?

I'm sorry.

The place is a
pigsty, so there's

All sorts of filth and
scum all over the carpets

With white stuff.

So when you have a chance, get
your crew to clean that up,

Too, please.
MAN: All right.

That I will say
"please," because I'd

Have to say it eight times.

Is there that little
microphone [inaudible]?

Yes, I got the table.

Yeah, get... see
what you guys can

Hustle to make it kind of look
like what the script says.

I know that the sitting around
up there is very important.

I can't get any of the ADs.

I can't get the...
You know, I think

I've got everybody assembled.

But there's no props.

There's the usual.

And nobody's told the
Art department that they

Need microphones and cameras.


Lloyd, is it
closeup on his face?

I guess.

Or over her shoulder
or something.

You know?

I mean, would
you want me to see

The candy bar or just his face?

Yeah, if you can.

It seems like most of it's...
Hey, Joe, keep talking about...

Just improvise stuff.

Certain chocolate
with red meat and

White... because white chocolate
I like with [inaudible].

MAN: Action.

How would you like to be in
this film I'm investing in?

Would you like a piece
of, uh, chocolate?

I didn't think so.

I eat this stuff all the
time... white chocolate,

Dark chocolate.

All right.

It's good.

I'm worried at this
rate we won't finish.

We're going so
incredibly slowly.

Yeah.

So how... maybe
if... I don't think

Brendan knows how much
there is to do after this.

In other words,
there's all this stuff.

And Joe has to then write up.

We've got to do the
stunt [inaudible].

That stuff from
behind there where

She's... I think he just thinks
there's, like, two shots.

I don't think there's any
concept of the work that

Has to be done.

There's also a question
of how much coverage

We do on each little scene.

You know?

We don't need to do coverage.

Well, we need a shot
of the dialogue.

That's what we've got to get.

But it's...

Don't we have that already?

No.

No, I don't.

That's the problem.

Would you like a
square of chocolate?

I really love chocolate.

I can eat it anytime.

I eat it at a car,
bar, in a restaurant.

White chocolate, dark chocolate.

MAN: I think it's
going pretty well.

We're moving along.

I went to the health
food store next door.

MAN: Oh, to get an
oat bran muffin.

WOMAN: OK.
You know what?

You...

Wait, I gotta get the...

Oh, yeah.

MAN: Folks, please keep it down.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Perfect.
OK.

Whatever.

Just make the fall good.

Bring the actor into place.

[Interposing voices]

And stop.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Beautiful.

All right, let's sing a prayer.

MAN: OK.

Here we go.

And roll Camera A.


MAN: Rolling.

MAN: Roll Camera B.

MAN: B.


MAN: Cut!

MAN: Clear, clear.

MAN: Everybody all right?

MAN: You all right, Bobby?
I'm OK.

MAN: All right.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

Yeah.

[Applause and cheers]

He did good?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Huh?

He was good?

Definitely.
It went on.

It never ended, too.

It kept going and going.

The escalator thing
was... we spent hours

Getting that guy in padding.

It was absolutely
not nec... there

Are fat guys around who do it.

You know?

Eh, I could do that.

Watch this.

The head is rolling
around on that escalator.

MAN: Got it.
Yeah.

The question is, we don't want
to see the stairs [inaudible].

Why not?
Oh, good.

All right? 'Cause I can
put them over here and go

From the escalator over here.

MAN: The wrong
direction, though.

As you pull back,

Take pictures of him.

We have 'em, yeah.

MAN: We're done with
the escalator stuff?

I don't... we're doing this now.

That's all I will tell you.

MAN: Excellent.

Thank you.

So we want to do
this, we need...

Brendan would like to have
some people taking photos,

Some commuters, whatever.

And then we need
the Lemmy, Lemmy,

The character who
was supposed to have

Been picked up a long time ago.

Huh?
They did go.

Yeah, they went late, though.

He should have been at
these rehearsals, you see?

Yeah.

You see?
See?

He's...

So he's gonna be
in here to do...

He's supposed to
be in the scene.

So now we're going
to rehearse it.

And Will is doing a great job.

But now we're going to have
to go through the whole thing

With Lemmy.

MAN: Lemmy is here, Steven.

Oh, cool.

Well, get his cue cards.

MAN: His cue cards.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hey, Lemmy.

All right.

How ya doin'?

This is a Coke and
Jack Daniels in a bag.

Lemmy's liquor!

Ah!

MAN: Stand by for picture.

MAN: Here, ready for Lemmy.

Excellent.


Madame.

Madame.

Madame, tell me,
how did you feel

When you first saw
the mangled body

Of this venal, fat bastard?

I believe my first reaction was


LEMMY: Oh, madame, we know how
painful this must be for you.

ADAM: I wanted to
introduce myself.

Adam Hammel.

I'm assistant director.

LEMMY: Absolutely.

Nice to meet you.

So now we have this monologue
thing we're talking about.

We are running a little behind
schedule today, so we're not...

LEMMY: Imagine my surprise.

Yeah.

So we're not positive we're
going to get to it today.

So rather than keep you here
the rest of the afternoon

And just have you sit around...

LEMMY: Then you'll
send me the fuck home.

Yeah.

And then if you want, we
can call you if it looks

Like we're going to get to it.

We could do it another
day, possibly by tomorrow.

Oh, we have tomorrow.

Yeah.

We could even do it [inaudible].

Exactly.

That's a really good idea.

Yeah.

So...

Just somewhere with
fucking air conditioning

This time, would you?

I know, really.

I'm sorry about that.

INTERVIEWER: This relive up
to your expectations of a...

Yeah.

Low budget.

Overheated.

No air conditioning.

Usual stuff.

PATRICK CASSIDY:
We can get in touch

If you want to be touched up.

MAN: I think he was
pissed off that he

Had to wait as long as he did
for being on set yesterday.

And then he never
got his stuff shot.

Are you sure?
Come on?

LEMMY: [inaudible].

He won't do that [inaudible].

If it was anything
other than that.

I mean... but that
was... guarantee you

That was the reason he
wasn't gonna come in.

And then Dave Schultz said
nah, we'll find something else.

And then that day... he
just doesn't want to... you

Know, and I don't blame him.

That's something
that... you know,

For a band of his image, that's
not the smartest thing to do.

Let's come up with
something else for him.

All I can tell you is, whether
it was relayed to you or not,

You don't leave him
for eight hours.

Never.

You lose him right
there in a moment.

I mean, you're talking about
a guy on speed and booze.

You know what I mean?

And you know, you use him
and you get him in and out.

That's how we do it.

We talked to Todd
and he said that Lemmy

Didn't want to do
the bit that we

Wrote about the hermaphrodites.

I didn't know that the content
was such a problem till,

Like, a half an hour ago.

WOMAN: This is my... Stephanie.

It's nice to meet you.

All right.

Well, here's our... here's our...


You got stuff to do.

Yeah, you guys are
just pissing him off.

Here's the only option
I have for you guys,

And it can't be done here.

Have him do... actually, he
said he wouldn't do that.

He rewrote it.

Have Dave shoot it [inaudible].

Think you can do that there?

A good scene?

MAN: It will never happen.

WOMAN: You're welcome.

INTERVIEWER: How did you hook
up with the Troma people?

LEMMY: Fair enough.

INTERVIEWER: Fair enough.

I feel like an idiot
about the Lemmy thing, too.

I was screaming and yelling.

And we have to
take care of Lemmy.

We have to do... baby
him and then we ended

Up wasting a shitload of money.

Yeah.

The stuntmen all have
wives and children.

Doesn't make for good stunts.

Supposedly they came.

They OKed it.

They agreed to have
their equipment here,

Which isn't here.

Now they're saying
it's more money.

And they're saying we lied
about how high the jump was.

There was lots of
screaming and yelling.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I don't
know what to say except

Find some white prick
that maybe we can

At least fake the [inaudible].

This is a jump for women.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: If I'm
on the ground here,

don't see as much of it.

I don't really
see the buildings.

I see the boxes, but I may
not get the entire floor.

MAN: I think that's
OK, because we


So I'd go for that [inaudible].

Yeah, at least we
get some height.

MAN: Yeah.
[inaudible] through space.

MAN: A dead ringer
for our actor.

Steven and Adam,
I think we ought

To try to get this thing off.

MAN: OK, here we go.

Very quiet, please.

And action!

Oh!

It's a cut!

Everyone stay clear, please.

MAN: Don't move.

I'm here.

Let's stay clear, please.

Everyone hold their positions.

MAN: This is a very tense
moment for everybody.

What's up?

[Applause and cheers]

(BREATHING HEAVILY) Yeah.

Yeah.

Lenny?

Yes?

Just drink a little water.


No, it's fine.

MAN: I knew it was
gonna be a hard fall.

And I was...
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was great.

Oh, thank you.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was great.

I was right under there.
It was great.

I tried to screech my feet
like I was fighting the...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was terrific.
Yeah, you did a great job.

Sensational.
This was the best.

It was the best.

You have shit.

I mean, it's boring stuff.

MAN: We'll work with it.

You know, we can work with it.

It would have been better to
get somebody cheaper and better.

Yeah.
But...

No, we should have just... well,
we should have just ordered

The... we should have
just done the stunt,

Just hired a guy
to do a high fall

And paid him whatever it is.

MAN: Right.

This was garbage.

MAN: Yeah.

There was no bone
with these guys.

Everything was no good.

Everything was bad.

Steven wanted to fire
him at the armory.

But I didn't want
to... I just didn't

Want to get into a fight.

That's after everything.

Steven did fire him, I think.

But I just didn't want
to get [inaudible].

Here's your final check.

You're fired.

It's not quite the... it's
not quite the same effect.

We need stuff that
looks more street level.

I'm worried this is
going to read roof.

Garbage bags.

What do we have here?

This sort of looks like
street-level stuff.

This [inaudible].

MAN: We used this in
the pregnant killing.

Yeah, but it's all
part of a movie,

So it'll throw people off.

Yeah, that's cool.

Let's put the flat here then.

Let's build up here, so
at least you can... yeah.

Maybe if you wanna fall on
this thing, go right ahead.

OK.

of the door there.

That's the thing,
that the garbage here

Would have to be
away, because then

You don't want to [inaudible].

Do whatever you want.

Slate in, roll sound.

MAN: Speed.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Watch yourself.

MAN: Second hand.

Ready?
Rolling?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

Cut, cut!

MAN: Wrap.

Cut!

Get the first aid kit, please.

I think you can come
out of that mask, right?

You wanna just grab Yaniv
running down Ninth Avenue?

MAN: To crush on his head.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Now we need Yaniv.

We need him running
and falling down.

You better look at a Polaroid.

Yeah, it's not...

They don't have enough gauze.

They don't have any gauze.

I asked two hours
ago about the gauze.

So now you're down.

Now your stuff is fucked, right?

It's the stupidest
bunch of people I've

Ever worked with in my life.

I hope it's on video.

I mean, I just don't believe it.

I even said it,
too, before lunch.

I said it to about eight people.

Now, look, you're the producer.

Go and solve it, Steven.

Please.

This is where it's
bad news, right?

This is why I don't want
anyone working past Friday.

I'll do it myself,
whatever it is.

All I know is it's a very
dumb bunch of people.

That's all I know.

Lazy and dumb.

And I hate everybody.

I definitely hate Adam, and I
hate Steven, and I hate Yurgi.

I hate you.

I understand.


MAN: Eventually I'll wash.

I hate this man.

That scent'll go away.

But there is love.

No.

Definitely not.

I love Yaniv.

I love you very much.

YANIV: Oh.

You want a hug?

Are you guys gonna have
enough to cover his mouth?

I'm doing the best I can.
OK.

Is that OK?

Well, what if you
put toilet paper, uh...

We don't have any,
'cause there's no toilet.

Oh.
Here's some big [inaudible].

Those napkins maybe
over his mouth.

We've lost the cock sock.

Serious problem.

Somewhere around here is
lurking a piece of pantyhose

That once was on Yaniv's dick.

Somebody finds that,
they're in serious trouble.

YANIV: I know the
second I do the shot,

What the fuck [inaudible].

I know.

YANIV: And then the cop won't
know, because I told him

I have...

Adam and Steven.

Adam and Steven,
sorry to interrupt.

We ought to make sure
there's no confusion

About what's on this guy's
pee-pee and all that.

So look at what's on there,
and then tell the policeman.

Make sure that whatever
he's wearing or not wearing,

We're in sync with
the officer, please.

The thing on my dick
looks ridiculous.

Why don't I take it off
now, but he won't know?

He's not looking.
MAN: OK, here we go.

Ready to go.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.

All right.
Just go over to your position.

You find [inaudible]
down there?

Yes.

You want the towel?

MAN: You should just have
it covering the top of you

For now, all right?

MAN: No, can you tuck your
face more up into the tire?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
that's gonna be great.

Can we... can we just
load him up with blood?

Just put a lot of blood
on his arms and legs.

And on his upper torso.

Do you have any
cranberry sauce or any

Of that other
gizzards or something

That can be laid gently on top?

YANIV: This arm
isn't really bloody.

You probably need
to bloody it more.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do your
electrocution, Yaniv.

Smack your head... smack your
hands a bit on the ground,

Because that'll make the
blood splatter a little bit.

All right, standing by.

OK, roll Camera A.


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Rolling.

MAN: Roll Camera B.
MAN: Rolling.

MAN: Rolling.

MAN: Ready and action!


LLOYD KAUFMAN: Kick
your legs more, Yaniv!

Wiggle 'em more.
Wiggle 'em.

Your hands, your legs.
MAN: [inaudible].

LLOYD KAUFMAN: That's it.
Do more of the electrocution.

Don't slap so much.

Up!

Up with your hands.

Up, up, up!

MAN: Your legs up, too.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
yeah, your legs up.

Up with your legs.
MAN: Yeah.

MAN: There you go.

MAN: Oh, that's it.
Up!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: More of that.
More of that!

That's it!
That's it.

Die!

Dead, dead.

[Applause and cheers]

Heh.

It doesn't look like there's
any penis there, though.

The only trouble is
it looked just like...

It didn't... all I could...

MAN: NC-17.

MAN: Oh-ho-ho.

Oh.

[Breathing heavily]

INTERVIEWER: Is it cold, Yaniv?

Yeah, it's fuckin' cold.


WOMAN: Cute.


MAN: Take a left!

A left!

Oh!

Yeah!



Thank you.

That was a very beautiful shot.

That was excellent.

Great.

I just wanted you
to [inaudible].

I said, no, I can't.

I was like, yeah, New York!

Yeah, I know.

If we do the thing in
post-production where we go

To San Gennaro Festival
and we do stuff

During Christmas at Macy's.

And then maybe you do a
cartwheel or something if we

Get our nerve up to do that.

MAN: OK, guys.
Let's wrap up.

Picture wrap.

Let's go home.

MAN: Yeah.

MAN: All right, guys.

That is a wrap for this movie!

[Cheers and applause]


[Music playing]

MAN: Last time I
heard, it was sold out,

So I think we're
doin' all right today.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Um, again,
there are many people who have

Made "Terror Firmer" possible.

And I cannot possibly
thank them all.

But for Michael
Hers and for me, we

Are very grateful
to the entire team

That made this film possible.

The theme of this film is to
call attention to the fact

That the independent
spirit, independent art,

Independent effort, independent,
entrepreneurial, independent

Politics are all under assault
as they never have been.

The fact that so many of
you are here in this cinema

Is evidence of the fact that,
indeed, the independent spirit

Lives, and a taste
to be challenged

And the desire to be challenged
by art in a cinema still lives.

So now let's make some art.

Thank you.

[Cheers and applause]

Woo!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's
get through this.

We're never gonna finish
the goddamn scene!

MAN: OK, right now...
Horse shit.

You're spending two
hours on a scene

That should take a minute.

MAN: I'll just go
over here and...

Get all them in. [Inaudible].

You don't need
anything now but Moose.

Just get all... everyone
here, everybody.

Everyone.

OK.

Can we have all actors
over here, please?

Here we go.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's
really dangerous the way

You're running this set.
OK, folks.

From now on, [inaudible].

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
What I'm suggesting

Is you gotta keep looking at it.

MAN: I... I have
no tab, video tab.

I can't tell.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well, it
isn't a matter of video tab.

That's like that
movie magic shit.

It's the same thing.

MAN: Well, if I had a chance
to look through the cards...

No, it's a matter of
just being careful,

Letting... keeping people
away from the edges.

MAN: OK.

I guess... so
nobody called any...

We didn't call people or...

MAN: Yeah, we did call
people, but a lot of people

Told us they're [inaudible].

Ah.

So that means when
we get to New Jersey,

We'll have actually
nobody on set?

They did their bags, right?

You better get your guys right.

MAN: Yup.

At least have the guts
to call us at night

And say you're not
gonna have anybody.

that area over there.


It's gonna fuck up... there's
already stuff in the dailies

Where you have people
standing around

In the background
kind of like just

Standing there having coffee.

Well, it...

You shoulda paid me, man.

I'm tellin' you.

You shoulda fuckin' paid me.

All I wanted is a little money
to get through the summer.

But instead, all you do is yell.

Yell, yell, yell, yell.

I can't fuckin' take it anymore.

What the fuck you doin' here?
