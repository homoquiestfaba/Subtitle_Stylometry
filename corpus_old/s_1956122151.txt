(CAR ENGINE REVS)

â™ª â™ª

There was a time when this guy was

the biggest pop star in the world.

The self-proclaimed king of punk-funk

broke through with the public
by defying expectations,

thumbing his nose at a mostly
old, white man industry,

and by openly advocating the
recreational use of narcotics.

("HARD TO GET" PLAYING)

â™ª Girl, you're cute, you're sweet â™ª

â™ª You're such a sexy treat â™ª

â™ª You are the girl that turns me on â™ª

â™ª And when you're hot, you're hot â™ª

â™ª I love the stuff you've got â™ª

â™ª You are the kinky girl
I write about in every song â™ª

â™ª Dooby doo-dah, dooby doo-dah â™ª

â™ª Dooby doo-dah, doo-doo,
bop-bop, baby â™ª

â™ª Oom pa-pa, oom pa-pa â™ª

â™ª Hey! â™ª

â™ª Don't be so hard to get â™ª
â™ª Oom pa-pa, oom pa-pa â™ª

Back when marijuana was illegal,

Rick James was the most
dangerous man in America,

and that was long before his arrest
for assault with a hot crack pipe.

But we'll get to that.

<i>This guy got Neil Young high before he</i>

<i>ever even met Crosby, Stills or Nash.</i>

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)


When I was on the road with Rick,

I couldn't stand cops, man.

They're always fuckin' with you.

I love 'em now. I love the police.

Please protect my old, black ass.

Keep these fuckin' renegades out
there, like I was growing up,

away from me, please.

Yeah, I love the cops now.

MIKE JUDGE: <i>Levi Ruffin Jr.
grew up with Rick James,</i>

<i>and spent a dozen years on the road</i>

<i>with the king of punk-funk
as the keyboardist</i>

<i>and leader of the Stone City Band.</i>

I remember one time, we were
coming through Florida,

going toward Little Rock.

<i>And one of the promoters
had called us...</i>

(PHONE RINGS)
<i>- ...he said, "Man,</i>

<i>you guys gonna get arrested,
man, they're waitin' for you,"</i>

<i>that he saw something on television.</i>

What the fuck you mean
they're waiting for us?

RUFFIN JR.:<i> And on the bus, man, we had
a television with satellite on it,</i>

<i>kind of bad, you know, but,
anyway, we found a spot to stop,</i>

and that's when we saw it.

<i>Shit, they had a prosecutor there,</i>

<i>and the AG, whatever you call
'em with all the cops and shit.</i>

<i>"We're not gonna have that Rick James</i>

<i>"and that Stone City Band
comin' through our town,</i>

<i>"spreading all these narcotics</i>

<i>"and Mari-ju-anas, and stuff
amongst our children.</i>

<i>We'll arrest every one of them."</i>


<i>I'm sitting there, cracking
the fuck up, man.</i> (LAUGHING)

Said that cannot be serious.

They were serious man.

(SIRENS WAIL)
<i>- We finally get to the goddamn gig,</i>

<i>and these motherfuckers, they all...</i>

<i>you know, the Smokey the Bear hats.</i>

(HELICOPTER WHIRRING OVERHEAD)
<i>- They was all around us.</i>

<i>There must've been a hundred
goddamn police up there.</i>

<i>I'm lookin' around, I see cats</i>

<i>all over the top of
the building with M16s.</i>

Said, "What the fuck is going on?"

This is in Arkansas or some shit.

<i>Remember this lady cop, I guess
she was runnin' this shit,</i>

<i>she was the sheriff or some shit.</i>

<i>She say, "We're coming on your bus."</i>

Rick was pissed. Talkin'
'bout, "No, you're not.

<i>"No, no, no, no. You know damn
well you can't come on this bus.</i>

<i>"This is a private fucking bus.</i>

<i>"This is our home: We sleep here,
we eat here, we fuck here,</i>

<i>"and we do other things here."</i>

'Course, he didn't mention the drugs.

<i>- "Do you have a warrant?"
"No."</i>

<i>"Well, you can't come on this bus.</i>

<i>"Leave us the fuck alone
'cause we got work to do."</i>

<i>We gettin' ready to go out on stage.</i>

(MATCH FLICKS)

<i>Now, see, I never smoked weed,</i>

but I smoked weed that night.

If we goin' to jail, we all
goin' to motherfuckin' jail.

That lady cop said, "We're
here to arrest Rick James."

<i>And she started asking our names,</i>

<i>and said, "Which one of
y'all are Rick James?"</i>

<i>- "I'm Rick James."
"No, I'm Rick James."</i>

'Cause, you know, "I'm Spartacus.
No, I'm Spartacus."

<i>And then we just walked out
on stage, and Rick said,</i>

<i>"You see all these goddamn
cops?" They said, "Yeah."</i>

<i>He said, "These son of
a bitch talkin' 'bout</i>

<i>arresting me if I
smoke this weed here.</i>

<i>"Are you guys gonna let him do it?"</i>

AUDIENCE: No!
RUFFIN JR.: "<i> No!"</i>

<i>Can't hear you!"</i>

AUDIENCE: No!
"<i> No!" Fuckin' crowd was in a frenzy.</i>

Rick was just a brother,
man, went out there

and did whatever the
fuck he wanted to do.

I understood Rick,
and Levi understood Rick

probably better than most people

because we grew up together
in a family sense,

in a black man sense.

JUDGE: <i>Danny LeMelle was
the arranger and director</i>

<i>of the horn section for
the Stone City Band.</i>

<i>He played saxophone and traveled the
world with Rick for seven years.</i>

Rick grew up in the ghetto,
like the majority of us.

<i>The people that we looked
up to were either...</i>

<i>for good or bad,
it doesn't really matter...</i>

<i>were black athletes, pimps, the
semi-gangsters of our neighborhoods.</i>

<i>These were the people we
had as role models. Why?</i>

We didn't have anything else
that we could look to,

unless you were lookin'
at<i> Leave it to Beaver,</i>

and that shit ain't had
nothing to do with us.

Yeah, but what do we know
about raising chinchillas?

But, that's what was
on TV at that point.

So, Rick had this thing

that, "When I hit the stage,
I have to pimp the audience."

In a good way. "They have
to follow everything I say."

â™ª Do-do-ba-do-do-ba â™ª
AUDIENCE: â™ª Do-do-ba-do-do-ba â™ª

â™ª Ba-ba-ba-ba â™ª
â™ª Ba-ba-ba-ba â™ª

â™ª Do-do-do-do-do-do â™ª
â™ª Do-do-do-do-do-do â™ª

â™ª Ski-do-ski-do-ba-do-ski-do â™ª
â™ª Ski-do-ski-do-ba-do-ski-do â™ª

LEMELLE: <i>"They have
to let me pimp them."</i>

They have to love the music.
They need to know all the songs.

They need to know this
joint is not a cigarette.

This is a joint, and if you want to
smoke it with us, we'll do that.

(FANFARE PLAYING)

JOANNE MCDUFFIE: <i>When I got there,
he had the giant marijuana joints</i>

on each side of him.

JUDGE: <i>Joanne McDuffie was selling</i>

<i>vinyl and cassettes in a
record store in Buffalo</i>

<i>when Rick James asked for her number,</i>

<i>to be a backup singer.</i>

Walking out on that
stage the first time,

<i>as a background vocalist,</i>

<i>it was quite frightening at first,</i>

<i>but it was truly amazing.</i>

â™ª We love Mary Jane â™ª
â™ª We love Mary Jane â™ª

â™ª We love to smoke the reefer â™ª

â™ª The marijuana reefer â™ª

â™ª We love Mary Jane â™ª

â™ª We love Mary Jane â™ª

(VOCALIZING, HARMONIZING)

â™ª â™ª

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

Marijuana became important

as it became less hippie,

jazz people,

and more everybody's
getting high all the time.

He was able to utilize

<i>"I am openly smoking dope in
front of your face, on stage,</i>

<i>"and I don't give a flying
fuck who knows about it.</i>

<i>As a matter of fact,
that will add to my charm."</i>

JUDGE: <i>David Ritz is a
ghostwriter by trade.</i>

<i>He's made a career of channeling the</i>

<i>voices of dozens of cultural icons,</i>

<i>artists like Marvin Gaye,
Willie Nelson, and Sinbad.</i>

Rick was born in Buffalo,
New York, which is a tough town.

Um, he learned to operate
on the streets, as his mom did.

<i>She worked for the local Italian mafia</i>

<i>as a numbers runner,</i>

<i>so he was raised to look up
to powerful criminals,</i>

who employed his mom,
and kept them alive.

Buffalo was the third largest Mafia
family after New York and Chicago.

So, the motherfuckers had, like,
noses over here named Guido,

<i>you know, "Fuck you, Paulie" and shit.</i>

<i>I mean, these guys were
straight gangsters, man.</i>

So, Mama did a good job.

You gotta remember,
there were eight in his family,

so he didn't dress the best, but, you

know, he looked good
whatever he had on.

JUDGE: <i>Betty Gladden was a single mom</i>

<i>and a former Cotton Club showgirl.</i>

Rick had music in his soul,

and she encouraged him tremendously.

She really had a feeling
for her baby, man.

JUDGE:<i> She tried to keep Rick and
his seven brothers and sisters</i>

<i>off the streets by
raising them Catholic.</i>

<i>Rick even spent time as an altar boy.</i>

I had met Rick James
in the third grade.

At the time, he was
James Ambrose Johnson Jr.,

<i>who had bad teeth, like
I did, had bad teeth.</i>

We were two little dudes,
I mean, real little.

<i>Played against each other in
football and stuff like that.</i>

(GRUNTS)
I didn't think he could sing,

but he could holler
real well back then.

(HOLLERING)
But he was a loud mouth.

Always talkin' 'bout music.

Rick realized his gifts early on.

His musicality is so flexible,

he can do jazz and black R&B,

or white rock 'n roll,

and he doesn't know
exactly which way to go.

His mother was his guiding light.

<i>I mean, she used to take him
to, uh, bars and nightclubs</i>

<i>when he was a little guy.</i>

<i>Not the other kids, but just him.</i>

<i>Because she saw in him something.</i>

I didn't, personally.

JUDGE: <i>As a teenager,
he lied about his age,</i>

<i>and joined the Navy
to try to avoid the draft.</i>

<i>At the time, a lot of
young men from the ghetto</i>

<i>were being sent to fight
and die in Vietnam.</i>

I don't know if people realize,

but Rick went AWOL, a lot.

But I've heard as high as 13 times.

JUDGE: <i>William Rhinehart sang backup</i>

<i>and played saxophone
with the Stone City Band</i>

<i>throughout the glory years.</i>

<i>He witnessed, firsthand,
the discipline and drive</i>

<i>it takes to be the king of funk.</i>

Rick was one of these guys
that nobody's gonna tell him,

"I gotta stop playing music
and go fight people in Vietnam"

He just wasn't gonna hear that.

Well, when your number comes up, you
have to report. Rick did not report.

<i>He refused to fight.</i>

His mother would sneak him
to and from Canada.

Buffalo's right over the
border from Canada.

<i>You can go to Niagara Falls
in about 20 minutes,</i>

<i>and then you drive another 30,
40 minutes, you're in Ontario.</i>

His mother, she had his back.

I mean, she would do anything for him.
She loved her some Rick.

I think that was her favorite child.

I mean, seriously.

JUDGE: <i>In Canada, the kid with
the buck teeth and the big voice</i>

<i>caught the attention of some
up-and-coming rock 'n rollers.</i>

<i>trying to capitalize on the R&B craze.</i>

<i>And that's how Rick James ended
up in the protest scene,</i>

<i>and playing in a band with Neil Young.</i>

RITZ: <i>He kind of finds
himself in a Neil Young,</i>

Joni Mitchell, anti-war, protest-y,

hippie, white, alternative culture.

JUDGE: <i>He fronted a band
called the Mynah Birds,</i>

<i>with Neil Young on guitar,</i>

<i>as well as other founding members of
Buffalo Springfield and Steppenwolf.</i>

RITZ:<i> Mynah Birds might have
worked if he hadn't been caught</i>

<i>by the Navy for going
AWOL and put into jail.</i>

I think he spent a month in brig,

then he got some type of discharge,

I don't think it was dishonorable, but

I don't think it was honorable either.

And then, he was free,
he didn't have to hide no more.

And within a year's time,
he was signed at Motown,

and doin' his thing.

JUDGE: <i>He wrote and
produced records for acts</i>

<i>like The Miracles, and The Spinners.</i>

<i>He worked in Los Angeles
as a session musician</i>

<i>for Berry Gordy, playing bass.</i>

<i>And he watched Neil Young
become a rock star.</i>

Rick came from the '60s,

he's thinkin',
"I need to be a 'rock star, '

but I need to be a black rock star."

He's like, "You know what,
this needs to happen.

"There needs to be a black guy on
the same caliber as Mick Jagger,

<i>on the same caliber as Roger Daltrey,</i>

<i>on the same caliber as David Bowie.</i>

He needs to be like that.

JUDGE: <i>He was reportedly
considered to play bass</i>

<i>for Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young,</i>

<i>but lost the gig to a guy he
introduced to the group, Greg Reeves.</i>

After that, the whole thing implodes

and he winds up going back home.

One day I'm sittin' there,
me and my old lady,

<i>up in the crib on Utica St.,</i>

<i>and all of a sudden,
somebody, you know,</i>

<i>ringin' the doorbell. "Who the hell?"</i>

<i>I look outside, and I see
a white Mercedes Benz.</i>

I said, "Who the hell do I
know that drives a Benz?"

<i>- So I go and see.</i>
(BEEPS)

<i>And he said, "It's Jim."</i>

'Cause that's what they
called him when we were kids.

(DOOR BUZZES)
<i>- And I buzzed him upstairs.</i>

<i>Man, he came in,
and he, you know, had on</i>

beautiful fur coat and shit, hat
broke down, lookin' real nice.

And asked me,
"Did I still have my band?"

<i>And I said, "Yeah,
I still have a band."</i>

He asked me what
was going on as far as music,

so the first thing I played for him
was some classic funk, as it were.

<i>James Brown, you know, Bootsy
Collins, and Funkadelic</i>

<i>And then Rick, "Stop." Said, "Man,
we can do better than that."</i>

<i>I said, "Shit, I'm down, then."</i>

And the rest is history, man,
we got together

and they kicked that ass.

Quite well... quite well.

JUDGE: <i>The Stone City Band
was led by Levi on keys,</i>

<i>with a full rhythm section,
horn section,</i>

<i>and backup singers.</i>

<i>Over the years, the lineup
included Danny LeMelle,</i>

<i>William Rhinehart, Joanne McDuffie,</i>

<i>Lanise Hughes and his brother Nate,</i>

<i>among many, many others.</i>

Rick James, he started
his own term: punk-funk.

He was the king of punk-funk.

When we first came out,

New Wave was just ending,

<i>punk music was just starting.</i>

Punk-funk was basically
just the rebellious part of punk

and then adding funk to that.

He started a movement.

The rebellious and danceable
music that's everyday life.

JUDGE: <i>The first album,</i> Come
Get It,<i> featured "Mary Jane,"</i>

<i>about a girl named Mary Jane</i>

<i>and how she was his "main thing."</i>

We used to come up with
grooves at soundcheck,

and Rick would write to that stuff,

and that's how most
of the songs came about.

Simple but, uh, hummable.

And I used to tell guys,
you know, how important it was

that you play stuff that people,

when they're taking a shower, can hum.
(HUMMING)

Daniel LeMelle, the saxophone player,

he used to playing all those
notes and all that extra shit.

Man, come one, that's jazz.

I call it "broke music."

'Cause guys that did that shit
really didn't make any money.

So, fuck the "broke music" shit,

play some shit that they can hum.

â™ª I'm in love with Mary Jane â™ª

â™ª She's my main thing â™ª

â™ª She makes me feel all right â™ª

â™ª She makes my heart sing â™ª

â™ª And when I'm feeling low â™ª

â™ª She comes as no surprise â™ª

â™ª Turns me on with her love â™ª

â™ª Takes me to paradise â™ª

JUDGE: <i>Rick, reportedly,
financed</i> Come Get It

<i>with help from his mom</i>

<i>by hitting up Betty's mob connections.</i>

Rick had a meeting
with Vincenzo and all

them other banana-nose motherfuckers.

<i>Look, I'm from Buffalo,
I can say that shit.</i>

There was a lot of "We gonna have
to shoot you motherfuckers."

That happened a lot, man.

<i>He just made everybody producers</i>

<i>before it was even, you
know, commonplace.</i>

I mean, it got much
crazier after that,

with all these hip-hop
motherfuckers, man.

JUDGE: <i>They started touring
after the second album.</i>

The overall look and persona

was, like, strong, sexy man thing.

<i>Everybody had braids, you know, like
you see Bob Marley's dreadlocks.</i>

Everybody's over six feet tall.

<i>So, you see over six-feet-tall men</i>

<i>that are in great shape
and wearing Spandex...</i>

I mean, come on.

Well, when Rick came to us,
you know, tellin' us

<i>his vision, with the
braids, and the all,</i>

<i>the guys was like,
you know, not havin' it.</i>

But when he started explaining
it was about being warriors,

uh, Maasai warriors,

<i>'cause they braided
their hair and whatnot,</i>

<i>we just went along with it because
you couldn't argue with Rick.</i>

We'd be onstage, jamming,
and, uh, in back of the stage,

you know, he would come
up an elevator...

(CHEERING)
<i>...and then the lights would hit him,</i>

<i>and he'd be in his cowboy
hat, and his cape and all.</i>

One of Rick's gimmicks
from the rock 'n roll days,

back in Canada, you know, uh...

<i>he used to take some balled-up
socks and stick it in his pants.</i>

<i>You know what I mean?</i>

Bigger than life.

(EXPLOSION POPS)

JUDGE: <i>Another key member
of the Stone City Band</i>

<i>was a guy they only knew
as "Pyro John."</i>

Pyro John. Rick wanted it
as loud as you can get it.

And, um, Pyro John did just that, man.

I mean, I thought I was in a war zone.

(POPPING EXPLOSIONS)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

It was like bombs going off,
I'm telling you.

It came from KISS.

He saw them, and he saw
the explosions...

(EXPLOSIONS)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

<i>you know, what they had on.</i>

<i>And he said, "We're gonna do this.</i>

"I'm gonna give the kids in the ghetto

<i>what the white folks
see all the time."</i>

â™ª â™ª


One of Rick's guitars
was rigged where,

you know, it was, like, sparks
flyin' out the end of it, right?

<i>One particular time, you know,</i>

<i>these sparks got close
to that, uh, cape,</i>

<i>- and that cape went up.</i>
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

And, man, people thought
it was in the show!

We have these dreads, with
these very colorful outfits,

um, it wasn't...

dazzling enough.

<i>So, he say, "Well, let's try glitter."</i>

Ooh-ooh! That glitter... I'll
never forget that glitter.

<i>I mean, once you put that glitter
on your hair, on your body, too,</i>

<i>you really couldn't get rid of it.</i>

That glitter was always there.

There's still glitter from 30
years ago in my saxophone case.

It looked great onstage,

<i>but I did not like the glitter</i>

<i>because wherever you go,
you're gonna leave a trail.</i>

We got a lot of, uh,

<i>phone calls from husbands
and boyfriends,</i>

<i>threatening to kill certain
members of the band,</i>

<i>because they woman would
come home, with glitter,</i>

in places it should not be. (LAUGHS)

JUDGE: <i>Rick was still
signed with Motown,</i>

<i>and by the third album,</i> Fire it Up,

<i>Berry Gordy called him
out to Hollywood.</i>

<i>He moved the whole band with him.</i>

As soon as we got off the plane,
we started rehearsin'

<i>for</i> Dick Clark Wednesday Night Live.

<i>The next day, we moved out of the
Holiday Inn on Highland Blvd.,</i>

<i>to Randolph Hearst's mansion.</i>

<i>It was a 21-room mansion
in Beverly Hills.</i>

<i>If you wanted to find somebody in that</i>

<i>house, you had to get on the intercom</i>

<i>'cause it was so big, I mean...</i>

(BUTTON BEEPS)
Yo, man.

...you couldn't find anybody.

This place is like
a fucking castle. I mean,

<i>marble shit here,</i>

<i>and winding stairways, and all
kinds of just beautiful shit.</i>

<i>Plus, they had a cook there</i>

<i>who cooked greens better than my mama.</i>

<i>That's when we were just a family,
man, thing was beautiful.</i>

Rick was always inviting
freaks and shit out to the crib.

But, it was cool. What
the fuck, we all grown.

When Rick used to give parties,

that was the first time I, uh,

I seen people swimming nude.

(CHATTERING)
<i>- I couldn't comprehend that.</i>

<i>I used to escape to Inglewood,</i>

<i>just felt more comfortable.</i>

One time, Jim Brown's daughter
came to the house.

<i>Jim Brown, uh, found out,
and he came to the house,</i>

<i>and Rick, Rick vanished.</i> (LAUGHS)

<i>There wasn't nothing
happening between, uh,</i>

Jim Brown's daughter and Rick.

But just the presence
of Jim Brown comin' to the house

<i>- scared Rick to death.</i>
(RICK GROANS)

He just disappeared.

What really blew my mind
was the shoppin'.

<i>We went to this place
called Di Fabrizio's.</i>

<i>Custom-made boots, man.</i>

Custom-made, perfectly fitted boots.

I don't know what they cost, but I
know they were a lot of fucking money.

<i>Now, the white guy at the
store, I understand it...</i>

<i>there's a whole room full of niggas</i>

<i>and I'm scared too, if I was him.</i>

We finally calmed him down, and Rick
said, "I'll tell you what, man,

<i>"I'll tell you what. We're gonna spend</i>

<i>thousands of dollars this afternoon.</i>

<i>"Are you cool with that?</i>

<i>"We're not gonna bother you, man,
you have the stuff that we need."</i>

<i>And we talked him down.</i>

<i>And finally calmed down. When
we left, he was quite happy.</i>

I think it was 35-thou. we spent.

He was wonderfully happy. (CHUCKLES)

JUDGE: <i>Rick liked to dress
like a cowboy, in all white.</i>

<i>And he took notice when his fans stole</i>

<i>his look and took it to the streets.</i>

We used to stay at the Park Plaza
in New York. And this one time,

<i>Rick and I, we were in a limousine,
going to do some shopping,</i>

<i>and we saw these girls
walking down the street.</i>

<i>And they were in all white,</i>

<i>and then they had
these cowboy hats on.</i>

<i>Everything just like Rick.</i>

<i>So, Rick looked at 'em.</i>

<i>He's like, "We're at the Plaza!"
He screamed it out the car.</i>

<i>- And they looked at Rick, so they
saw who he was.</i> -(WOMEN SCREAM)

<i>So, we go do some shopping.
This is about</i>

<i>four hours late, we
go back to the hotel,</i>

<i>these girls are in the room.</i>

<i>Don't know how that happened.</i>

<i>This is the Park Plaza, now.</i>

<i>Could've robbed us blind.</i>

Could've been crazy.

But it didn't turn out that way.

It was wonderful.

<i>But Rick called the hotel
manager, said,</i>

<i>"Look, that ain't supposed to happen."</i>

We stayed there a whole week, free.
"A perk."

JUDGE: <i>The experience may have
also led to his biggest hit.</i>

("SUPER FREAK" PLAYING)

HUGHES: <i>He was sitting at
one of the rehearsal rooms</i>

at Record Plant, messin' around,

and that's how that got started.

He started playing this bass part,

and then you could see
the sparks happening.

â™ª She's a very kinky girl â™ª

â™ª The kind you don't
take home to mother â™ª

â™ª She will never let
your spirits down â™ª

â™ª Once you get her off the street â™ª

â™ª Oh girl â™ª

LEMELLE: <i>Rick started
talking about a girl</i>

that he wanted to get with,
that he couldn't bring home.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Had
drug reference in there, too.

<i>But it just had all
the elements of stuff</i>

<i>he had been doing all his life.</i>

â™ª The girl is pretty kinky â™ª

â™ª That girl's a super freak â™ª

â™ª I'd really love to taste her â™ª

â™ª Every time we meet â™ª

â™ª She's all right, she's all right â™ª

â™ª That girl's all right with me â™ª

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª Hey, hey, hey, hey â™ª

HUGHES: <i>It was really
a throw-away song.</i>

You know, it was just,
he needed one more song

to throw on his album <i>Street Songs.</i>

I think in every musician's
career, there's a song

that they don't like, and to
them, it's a throw-away song.

And then, next thing you know,
it's the biggest thing ever.

Well, with Rick, it was "Super Freak."

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Oh girl â™ª

<i>Street Songs</i> went
triple... triple platinum.

We were kickin' that ass
out there, man.

Whoppin' that shit like it was right.

Well, about that time, Rick said,
"Hey, man, let's go to lunch."

I said, "Okay." We go to lunch.

<i>And we're sittin' there,
and here comes Neil Young.</i>

<i>And he called him "Ricky."</i>

And he sittin' down there, kickin' it.

<i>I'm sittin, "God, this is
fuckin' Neil Young.</i> (LAUGHS)

You know, one of the giants
of rock-dom, as it were.

<i>And they're kickin' it up,
laughin' about the old days.</i>

<i>I'm sittin' there mesmerized.</i>

<i>And Rick was one of the
few people in Toronto</i>

<i>that told Neil, "Why don't you sing?"</i>

I wouldn't have done it.

I thought he had one of
the worst voices in the world,

but nobody else
can sound like Neil Young.

And therein lies the fact
how he got so hugely successful.

He always could write and play,

but it was his sound.

<i>We're sittin' there, and I'm
listening to these giants, man.</i>

I remember Neil saying
how proud he was of Ricky.

<i>Because, "Man, you're doing it.
You're number one."</i>

It was beautiful, man.
Absolutely beautiful.

JUDGE: <i>It may have been beautiful,</i>

<i>but it was not enough for Rick James.</i>

I mean, he gave a two-hour
show every night,

and it was high energy.

<i>He was headlining, and he was, like,</i>

what the people had been waiting, four

or five months, in
anticipation to see.

He'd reached that echelon.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

<i>But MTV didn't care.</i>

You could watch
Neil Young all day long.

This was before MTV was playing
black music, let's put it that way.

They may have been around, but
they weren't playing any of us.

I don't think there was a BET yet.

NEWSMAN: What is the problem with
MTV not playing your material?

What's going on?

I wish I could answer that.
I see all these acts...

some of them don't have record deals,

some of them don't sell nine records.

Then there's acts that sell millions
and millions of copies of records.

People want to see them,
and we're not seen.

Maybe it's the skin we're in.

JUDGE:<i> Next time, the super
freak gets his wish,</i>

<i>and it gets super freaky.</i>
