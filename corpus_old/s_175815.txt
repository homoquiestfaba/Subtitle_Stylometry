We're detecting a high energy
reaction from inside the target!

We're detecting a high energy
reaction from inside the target!

It's accelerating, and
massing in upon itself!

It's accelerating, and
massing in upon itself!

Is it possible?

No, dodge it!

Retrieve him, hurry!

The target has gone silent!

How's Shinji?

He's alive!

Unit 01 has been recovered.
Send it to the 7th cage.

I'm going to the cage.
Take over for me, please!

Unit 01 secured!

The pilot's brain waves are
extremely erratic!

His cardiac readings
are very weak.

lncrease power to life support.
Give him a heart massage.

Roger!

Pulse confirmed!

Force eject the entry plug! Hurry!

Emergency LCL discharge!

Roger!

Come on, open the hatch! Hurry!

Shinji!

The enemy's accelerated particle
beam cannon has hit the balloon!

The decoy has been vaporized!

Next.

The Type 12 Mortar has
been vaporized!

I see.

From the data we've collected,
we're assuming that the Angel

automatically attacks any
opponent within a certain range.

Anything entering that range
will be targeted.

It's too risky for close range
combat in an Eva, isn't it?

What's the status of its AT field?

It's still active.

It's strong enough that the spatial
changes in phase are visible.

Using conventional attacks,
guided missiles, artillery, bombs,

will inflict more damage on
us than on the Angel!

Offensively and defensively it's
almost perfect. A flying fortress.

What's the status on its drill?

At this moment the target
is directly above us,

penetrating the Tokyo 3 Null Zone.

A giant shielded drill with a
diameter of 17.5 meters

is boring towards NERV HQ.

The enemy is going to attack
NERV Headquarters directly.

Sassy bastard!

What's its ETA?

06:54 AM, just after midnight.

By that time, it will breach all
twenty-two levels of armor,

and compromise NERV
Headquarters itself.

Less than ten hours...

The drill has contacted the
first armor plate.

What's the condition of Unit 01?

The defensive armor was melted
down to the third layer.

The good news is that the central
control unit sustained no damage.

Three more seconds, and it would
have burned right through the Eva.

It will take three hours to install
replacement parts.

Roger.

What's the status of Unit 00?

Re-activation itself should
prove no problem,

but there's still a feedback error.

So it wouldn't...

...survive combat.

What's the condition of
Unit 01's pilot?

No physical damage.

However, his nerve
pulses are up by 0.8.

Still within acceptable limits.

Enemy arrival:
9 hours, 55 minutes.

Talk about you high
pressure situations!

Why don't we just raise
a white flag?

Before we resort to that,

there's one little thing
I'd like to try.

You want a sniper to shoot the
target from outside its firing zone?

Yes, Sir.

Instead of trying to neutralize
the target's AT field,

I believe a pinpoint shot with a
high-energy beam is the only way.

What do the Magi say?

The responses from the
Magi Super Computers

were two affirmative and one
conditional affirmative.

Our probability of success
is 8.7 percent.

It's the highest value we could get.

I see no reason to reject the plan.
You may proceed, Captain.

Yes, Sir.

You know how crazy this whole
operation is, don't you,

Operations Director Katsuragi?

Don't be rude. It's not crazy!

It can be executed within the
nine hours we have left,

and has the highest
chance of success.

It does? Really?

But our positron rifle can't
handle such high output.

What are you going to
do about that?

We'll borrow one of course.

Borrow one? You don't mean...

Yeah! The Strategic Self Defense
Force Lab's new prototype!

NERV is hereby requisitioning this
Self Propelled Positron Cannon

as of 15:00 today.

But this is ridiculous!

We'll try to return this in as close
to its original condition as we can.

Thank you for your cooperation!

Okay, Rei! Take it away!

Be careful. That's a piece
of precision machinery!

Ma'am? Our calculations
show that it will take

at least 180 million kilowatts
to penetrate that AT field.

Where in Japan are you going to
to get that much electricity?

From all of Japan. We'll take it all!

We apologize for interrupting

our regular programming for
this Emergency Bulletin.

From 11:30 PM tonight until
tomorrow morning,

there will be a large scale
power blackout

throughout most of Japan.

We appreciate your cooperation.

Repeat, from 11:30 PM tonight
until tomorrow morning

there will be a large scale power
blackout throughout Japan.

We appreciate your cooperation.

The drill has just broken through
the seventh defensive layer.

What's the status on our
energy supply?

3.2% behind schedule, but we
should be finished by 23:10.

And the positron rifle?

For the honor of Technology
Development Department 3,

we're betting that we'll have
it built in three hours.

And how's our defense coming?

Well, using a shield is
about all we can do.

So, this is the shield?

Yes. It was part of a single
stage trans-orbital rocket.

It may look ugly, but it's got an
electromagnetic base coating that

Section 2 guarantees will stand
up to the enemy's particle beam

for at least seventeen seconds.

Good. Have you determined
the sniper position?

Given the location ofthe target,
taking geographical features and

power access into consideration,
this would be our best choice.

Right. Looking good.

Our sniper will attack from
the top of Mount Futago!

The Operation will commence,
at 00:00 tomorrow morning!

From this point on, this operation
will be called "Operation Yashima".

Roger.

Now, the only remaining
problem is the pilot.

Unit 01's designated pilot
is conscious now.

His examination results
look normal.

Good. Then, the operation
will proceed as planned.

Roger.

But I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

Let's get to Mt. Futago now!

Ayanami...

I'm here to brief you on the
Operation Yashima timetable.

The operation will begin at
midnight, 00:00 hours.

Pilots lkari and Ayanami will arrive
at the cage by 17:30.

At 18:00, Units 01 and 00
will activate.

At 18:05, both units
must be deployed.

They will arrive at the temporary
base on Mount Futago at 18:30.

There, they will await
further orders.

The Operation will begin
promptly at midnight.

This is the new one.

Don't show up looking like that.

Sorry.

I've been apologizing
since yesterday.

Your meal.

I don't want to eat anything.

We'll be departing in
sixty minutes.

Do I really have to pilot
the Eva again?

Yes, you do.

I don't want to.

Maybe you can be so
cool about it,

because you haven't had the kind
of experiences I've had yet.

I don't want to go through it again.

Then, you can stay here in bed.

What do you mean by that?

I'll pilot Unit 01.

Dr. Akagi is already prepared to
rewrite the personal data files.

Ritsuko is...

I'm leaving. Captain Katsuragi and
Dr. Akagi are waiting for me.

Goodbye.

They're really late. We ought
to evacuate to the shelter.

I hacked into my dad's data files.

I'm sure this is the time.

Why aren't they here then?

The mountain is moving.

The Evangelions!

Cool!

Go for it, Evangelions! We believe
in you! Beat the Angel!

The drill has penetrated through
the 17th layer of armor.

It will reach headquarters
in 3 hours 55 minutes.

Power supply transfer from
Shikoku and Kyushu is completed.

Beginning tests of each
cooling system.

This is a very delicate piece of
machinery! Handle it carefully.

This thing wasn't built for field
operations. Will it really work?

There's no choice. This is the most
expedient way of gaining our goal.

Are you sure it's safe to use?

Theoretically, yes.

However, we're not sure if the
cannon barrel and accelerator

will be able to handle
the stress or not.

This is the first time it's been fired
with such a high power output.

Here are the battle plans
for the operation.

Shinji...

Shinji...

Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

Right.

Rei, you will cover him
with Unit 00.

Right.

This is because Shinji has a higher
sync ratio with Unit 01,

and this operation will require
exceptional precision.

Since the positron beam will be
influenced by the Earth's gravity,

magnetic fields and rotation, it
will not fire in a straight line.

You must remember to make
adjustments for these deviations.

You must penetrate the
core precisely.

But I've never practiced this!

Don't worry.

Just do what the manual says.

When the indicators converge in
the center, pull the trigger.

The computers will
handle the rest.

Also, be aware that before you can
fire the rifle a second time,

you'll have to wait for the unit to
cool, replace the fuses and reload.

And if I miss? Or if the
enemy shoots back?

Don't think like that.

You must destroy it with
your first shot.

So I have no choice.

l...

I'm just to defend Unit 01, correct?

Yes.

Understood.

It's time. Get geared up.

Right!

Maybe...

...this is our last day alive.

Why do you say that?

You won't die.

I'll protect you.

Why do you pilot this?

Because I'm bonded to it.

Bonded?

Yes, it's a bond.

You mean to my father?

To all people.

You're very strong, Ayanami.

I have nothing else.

What do you mean, "you
have nothing else"?

It's time. Let's go.

Goodbye.

The time is now 00:00.

Commencing operation.

Shinji, we're entrusting you with
all the energy of Japan.

I'm counting on you.

I'm counting on you.

Ayanami!

Don't say... Don't say that
you have nothing else.

Don't say goodbye when you leave
on a mission. It's too sad.

Why are you crying?

I'm sorry. I don't know what to do
or feel at a time like this.

Why don't you try smiling?

NERV isn't the only agency
trying to combat the Angels.

When the giant humanoid robot
created by a civilian corporation

goes out of control during
its official trial run,

it's up to Eva Unit 01 to
catch the rampaging Jet alone.

Can Misato stop its nuclear
reactor from melting down?

It's the next episode:
"The Human Creation".

And of course, I'll give you
lots of fan service too!
