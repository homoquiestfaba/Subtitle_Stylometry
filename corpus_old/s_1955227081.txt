[Music playing]

I used to work in a
video store in Baltimore...

And then I happened to
come across the Troma

Web page, which I've been a big
fan of for many, many years.

I drove seven hours to
get here from Connecticut.

I got here, they
started me working.

I'll go back to selling
shoes when the movie's over.

Kevin, you're from
a faraway land.

Yes.

Where'd you come from?

England.

I'm from Sweden.

Really?

Yeah.

And how does this differ
from movies in Germany?

Actually that's my first time
working on a movie, though.

I can't really tell.


So we have this church?

Yeah.

The downstairs, with a
stage and an auditorium.

Lots of little rooms to
do costumes and effects.

What's the best thing
about this location?

The space.

It's huge.

It's really great.

Arbie!

You're the best darn
humper in school!

Choke it, choke it.

What the hell's
going on in here?

Oh!

I'm going home!

Wendy, wait-come back!

Did that go well?

Yeah.

Kinky girl.

Robin Watkins.

Joshua Olatunde.

Jason Yachanin.

Kate Graham.

Allyson Sereboff.

Rose Ghavami.

I was possessed by a
chicken monster today.

Maybe three or four of them.

It looks so sweat shop when
everyone's sewing at once.

I know.

Thumbs up.

Ow!


Gabe, our producer.

What, are you running
some kind of school here?

Well, I want them
down to five minutes

For each chicken zombie.

If we want 80 or
200 chicken zombies,

We've got to have speed.

Speed and quality.

Speed over quality maybe.

So this is a sweatshop
zombie school.

What time is it now?

It's late, it's maybe
1:00 in the morning.

What's the date?

The date, I have no idea.

I don't know what day
of the week it is.

I can't believe I left Arbie
for someone as horrible as you.

Oh, Arbie.

I was such a fool to leave you.

I'm trying to fucking act!

Cut it off!

I just want to get this
fucking shit over with.

[Chicken squawk]

[Music playing]

I think day will go OK.

Just a lot of dialog, right?

Small effects.

A little dialog.

The acting's good.

The camera crew is here.

The set looks good.

The walkie talkies seem to work.

Hopefully all the
props are here today.

How do you feel about it?

I think it's going to be good.

A little worried.

Lloyd's not here yet.

He said we can feel
free to start without him

If we're ready.

Yeah, yeah, that's all right.

Yeah?

Yeah, that's fine.

Yeah, he likes that.

It's a lot of metal stuff.

Metal on metal, should not
make any sounds at all.

Hey, Lloyd Kaufman.

Yay, morning everyone.

How are you?

That's all right, keep going.

Going to be the best
shot of the movie.

Now we're just about ready to
get the first shot of the day

Up.

You the manager?

I wouldn't have cut it.

I would've kept going.

Sound two.

Action.

You're hired.

I won't take no for an answer.

It's yours.

So you want to play
hardball, huh mister?

Two can play at this game.

Cut.

You had camera noise.

Do you want to do it again?

No!

Don't raise those issues.

What's wrong with you?

You want to move the
thing, quietly tell me.

You don't yell it out.

You tell me very quietly, OK?

Now I know.

I didn't know.

It's Tromaville.

We don't even care
if it's in focus.

Roll sound.

Speed.

Sound five.

Sound five and action!

So what happened?

It stopped by itself.

Oh.

There are not that make
technicians who can handle

Working on a Troma movie.

You know, these guys are
sleeping on air mattresses.

They're living the Troma style.

They're certainly not
getting anything close

To what they get on
commercials or documentaries.

Everybody, sound is ready.

OK.

Standing by.

Action!

Action, chicken, action!

More jiggling.

Bigger, bigger!

The instant we try it,
explodes everywhere.

Oh fuck.

How did that happen?

This is downright dumb.

This is very dumb.

Is there anyone doing
anything other than this woman

Holding her finger in it?

Yes.

Lets do the dialog facing
this way while they're...

No, no.

We'll do this dialog.

Stop it up, get
fucking out of here

And we'll do Arbie's dialog.

Welcome to Tromaville.

You've got a guy testing
who's working this,

He's never done it before.

Richard's been doing this...

No, he hasn't been doing it.

He did the last rehearsal.

Good, Larry.

Get Larry's boom.

Caleb, this... this is...

The posters are
sweating off the walls.

Well, that's why they should've
been put up three weeks ago.

I'm just trying to
stay out of the way.

You know what I mean?

You can handle that business?

Just tape the shit over it!

Who has tape?

So how can we go up on
top there without tape?

Where's Humus's prayer rug?

We have that.

Well, it should be here!

Why didn't you notice
there's no fucking... why did

You not notice it's not there?

He's starting to lose it.

We've been here since 6:45 in
the morning, and it's 6:45 PM.

So, a 12 hour shoot so far,
and we're still not done.

Slate in.

Speed.

Sound 33.

Action.

If this is the way it
goes on a scene like this,

I mean, I can only imagine,
on like a fight scene.

With, like, blood
and guts... it's

Going to take like 24 hours.

It's starting to rain.

It's starting to rain, Lloyd?

Yes.

So we could have filmed
in the graveyard.

For some reason we didn't
film in the graveyard.

This would've been perfect
to film in the graveyard.

Thunder, lightning,
electricity, naked people.

Would've been the perfect
way to open the movie.


Magic hour.

So, yeah, it's really early
and we're all wet right now.

We're all stinky,
because we just woke up.

And... it's a nice surprise.

I'm sorry, so
please, do it again.

From the top.

The idea of this is to
have both these wacky gags

As well as sexy stuff.

Great, this is
what we do, Gabe?

Yup.

Could start here, then...

This is the hottest
scene that has ever

Been recorded in film history.

OK, now Micki, you
can't stop yourself.

Good Wendy, good Micki.

Go more like a doggie.

There, that's it.

Can you see it, Brendan?

Is it funny?

Yes.

Ready, action.

Perfect.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Now cut it, cut it, cut it.

That's great.

It was very, very good.

But your body should
be, you know, like that.

And there wasn't enough
of the... oh, come on.

[Music playing]

Of course these are not
professional dancers.

By the looks of it, they
don't work out a lot.

You should be having an orgasm.

Want to take a picture
of me, going like this?

The key is to build it
up to a beautiful orgasm.

So that at the end... like
the end of music videos...

At the end it's
quiet and you go down

And Micki's having a
huge throbs of orgasm.

OK?

The last... OK, we got it.

All right, very cool, so...

What's going on in here?

We got... one of
our lead actresses

Looks like she wants to
kill herself between takes.

And we're a little
worried about her.

Has Lloyd talked to her yet?

Lloyd doesn't notice.

All Lloyd sees is 10 pair of
tits around him right now.

But it came out.

I think it's going to be great.

It's something I've
never seen before.

The whole scene.

And just your shot
is just, you know.

Pornographic?
No!

Oh, come on.

Orgasm, Allyson, have a
good orgasm right now.

It's good, trust me.

It shall be good.


And, heavy breathing.


Very cool.

Now, when do the eat
clam behind come in?

Well, it's the third
day of filming.

This is the night shoot.

It was supposed to
be the first night,

But it was canceled
due to thunderstorms.

Now we're finally
here at the fabulous

Ancient Indian cemetery.

It's very noisy around here.

People stop, people honk.

Causing a big ruckus
in this small town.

But hopefully
we'll pull through.

And... move a little
bit... and action!

Make your move to go
on top of her... action.

All right, cut.

Instead of saying cut, we like
to have the lights shut off.

Conserve energy, right?

It's very good.

Good.

There we go again.

Wow, they really
like to save money.

Well, it's midnight.

We're never going to make
it to the end of the night.

We have a lot to do.

I think it's time to
start ripping pages up,

Because this is like
an eight hour movie.

Every scene is taking
twice as long as it should.


What keeps happening
to the light,

Are you getting kick outs?

I think it's the
crap equipment.

The famous Troma
high-tech equipment.

What's going on behind the
future site sign over there?

I just noticed this
like halfway through.

Like about 45 minutes
ago I was like, oh look,

It's John Karyus
getting into position.

When I just looked over
there, and after all this shit

That's been going on, to
be the exact same position.

I could put this on
fucking time lapse.

We'll see the sun go up.

There you go.

Now you come around.

Does that make sense,
without kicking the cable?

That's it.

Say Arbie.

Hey Arbie.

Yeah!

Arbie.

Yeah.

Kaopectate motherfucker.


Very good.

The night is about
three quarters finished

And we've done about
10% of the work.

Get in there.

Hurry up.

Blood.

Push the blood out.

Get it out of there,
hurry up, hurry up.

Shove it in.

Shove it out.

Please.

Full-on day right now.

Now the shit comes out.

Where's the shit...
The Baby Ruth?

I just dropped them.

Oh, all right, all
right, then cut.

This is it.

This is the scene.

This is it.

We don't have... we can't keep
adding days to the schedule.

See, this is when
you don't test stuff,

The zombies are setting
themselves on fire.

Sing, John.

[Music playing]


Oh, fuck.

The first guy's on fire.

Cut, cut, cut.

Did you get all that?

Oh my God.

Are you OK?

What is that?

Are you all right?

Holy shit.

I think it went very well.

I kept my cool, as I always do.

I'm really pissed.

I can't tell you
how pissed I am.

You're going to
hear it tomorrow.

I know I will.

It went very, very well.

It's a tribute to the team.

You have a wonderful,
wonderful team here.

Good morning Tromaville.

How's everything looking?

Everything going all right?

It's going to be great again.

Another perfect day.

See what I have here?

I have a list of...
Because we want

The actor persons
to feel nice... so I

Have a list of their names.

So I can address them by name.

What's your name?
Stacy.

Oh, Stacy.

What's your name?

Torie.

Torie, I'm sorry.

How we doing this morning?

Fan-fucking-tastic.

The whole reason why we need
you here during rehearsals

Is so I don't have to waste time
explaining, do you understand?

All I need to know is
what your first shot is.

Yeah, but if you were
here at rehearsals

You wouldn't have to ask me.

If you have the camera
up during rehearsals?

Yes.

Yes.

I've had this camera
up for an hour.

It's just a car.

We can get the sound later.

We work together
on doing a shot.

If you're not around to
help us and work with us,

I can't help you now.

Fine, lets just do this
and get it over with.

Everyone knows except you.

Fuck this, man.

All I want to know
is what your opening

Angle is you fucking moron.

This whole shoot's
been crappy audio.

Has it really been that bad?

It's going to echo like crazy.

It's going to sound like shit.

No, no.

Dude, go away.

Is anybody going
to listen to me?

It's not your fault. It's just
the surroundings and whatnot.

Standing by!

Uh, cut.

It's a bigger problem.

The problem with
daytime shootings.

You have clouds,
things like that.

It changes the
exposure in the camera.

It doesn't really matter, but
the directors of photography,

They think it matters.

It doesn't.

Nobody's going to
notice that this shot is

Slightly differently exposed.

Are we legally blocking
off Bailey here?

Well, I'm pretty sure
that guy over there, Sal,

Isn't an actual police officer.

But we do have an orange bucket.

I think that is the
seal of legitimacy.

That's all right, one second.

Action!

What do we want?

For the evil,
devil-worshiping [inaudible]

Conglomerates to
cease the destruction

Of our beloved country.

And replacing
corporate [inaudible]

With more cookie-cutter
retail spots!

How do you think
that went, Debbie?

It's just a first shot, but...

It's so hilarious.

It's so good.

These guys are great.

It was amazing, there
wasn't a single mistake.

It's the best prepared
Troma movie, for sure.

Kept singing and dancing,
it's so elaborate.

Yeah, we've been able
to rehearse this stuff

For a number of weeks.

Yeah!

Woo!


Perfect, great.

What's in the bag, John?

Ice.

Thank you.

I'm most concerned
about my camera work.

I'm concerned that I got
so wrapped up in just

Keep the thing going
that I wasn't focusing

Enough on the camera work.

Roll camera, and slow jiggling.

A little more toward camera.

Face me better.

And now faster.

OK, back up, slow down.

My breasts on camera, close
up, are something that is not

All that un-commonplace,
particularly on home

Videos of me and my friends.

So, might as well
make it public, right?

Fair enough.

Hey!

What's the big blood effect
that we're doing today?

We're going to completely
drown the kitchen

Area in blood from the meat
grinder when Packard falls in.

Think it'll work?

Absolutely.

Nothing's gone wrong so far.

I couldn't imagine this
being any different.

[Music playing]

We're fucked.

So put it back in and
we'll shoot it wide.

The whole scene too.

Yes!

So is this your
first stunt, ever?

Yeah, it is.

And action!

One, two, three.

Balls!

There are all the
regular concerns when

You jump into a meat grinder.

Along with that, we
don't have running water.

And our first aid kit consists
of like two band aids.

Oh good, so that's
on my list too.

Fall!

Shake the legs!

Shake your legs!

Slow!

Go in, go in slow.

Go in slow.

Cut!

Absolutely fucked up.

No blood.

Guy goes in, in one
second he disappears.

It's exactly total bullshit.

We're fucked.

I think it's over.

I really do, unless
you can get your act

Together with these people.

[Music playing]

OK, cut!

Very nice, so now we've
got to get the dialog.

You spraying him with Lysol?

At his request.

The biggest problem
is that you haven't

Gotten to this stupid
dance, and now Caleb's

Thing with the chickens.

We're going to be
another day behind.

So that's very complicated.

You ought to have him test now.

Is Devlin here?

Yeah, he's here.

Are they doing it?

Seriously, you should have...
No.

Yeah.

They should do blood... do it out
in the parking lot, whatever.

Film it at lunch time.

Right?

No, film it now and we'll
look at it at lunch time.

Right?

Is anybody listening?

I can't see.

They said you can take
smoke breaks every two hours.

They say a lot of things.

Yeah, yeah!

I even read that in the manual.

You know?

You look young.

You know?

You know?

You look young.

I'm the young one.

I know that!

I'm trying to fucking act!

Cut it off!

No, I'm not nervous, I just
want to get the day moving.

The thing I'm concerned
about on my dancing

Is the acting part of it.

Forget the dance, dance is
performance with your face.

You know, alone.

And all that stuff.

I should be doing it.

I keep forgetting to do that.

Happy face, sad face, gay face.

That has as much to do
with it as the movement.

I'm too wrapped up
getting the... this stuff.

I'm too wrapped up in the moves
and I forget about the moved.

fine arts is the [inaudible]

Of [inaudible], but
for me, it's just

Debt for another four years.

No, I'm soaring on the
wings fried gold and brown,

On these flightless
birds I run this town.


Does he not know that
his balls are hanging out?

They just told him.

And he still hasn't...

I've never seen anyone
like that before in my life.


Don't eat pizza,
peanut butter and jelly,

And jalapeno dip right before
you come to a morning shoot.

You want to see proof?

In there.

This is going to
be a puke orgy.

We crowded 50 people into
the restaurant, filled

Up 50 cups of vomit, and I don't
think we know what we're doing.

Where's Gabe?

In all the eight directions.

Some ideas.

Nobody's to be seen.

All right, well we're screwed
now, so do the best you can.

I guess we'll just
do this one piece.

Marlene, maybe
you'll start it off.

You vomit this way.

Everybody ready?

Roll and action!

Cut.

What do you think of the vomit?

It's hilarious.

It's like a porn movie.

Do you find it disgusting?

It's gross.

I love it.

It's frigging nasty.

I hope it doesn't
come anywhere near me.

I think our failure
so far has been

We haven't been
able to duplicate

The "Tromeo and
Juliet" funny spewing,

Where it just kept coming.

And that's rather a pity.

But we soldier on.

Just like the shuttle, those
tiles keep falling off.


Gabe, you putting him
jerking off in the bathroom?

He's just reading a
dirty magazine, yeah.

But everyone's lined up
outside for the toilet

Because they're all throwing up.

That's the humor.

That's the joke.

I don't get... no, no,
I don't want to do this.

Hey, come on, man.

That's the script.

The script is
different than your...

No, but I'm
looking at the scene

And it's not working for me.

What does this have
to do with lighting?

Just out of curiosity.

It has to do with continuity!

The guy is just reading
a dirty magazine.

We're not going to
do a prolonged scene,

And try and do a story where a
guy's on the toilet jerking off

Right now.

Do you want to do that?

No, but I wouldn't mind
seeing the magazine.

What's the problem with
the way it's scripted?

This is the wrong
magazine, too.

This was not the one I approved.

No, that's the right one.

Nope, nope, the one I
approved, you could read this.

I said to outline.

I said to outline.

I said green is
composed of blue.

Green has blue in it.

You're screaming at that point.

You were, like, in pain.

This should have either
black outline around it

Or it shouldn't be that color.

It should be yellow.

Like that.

We're supposed to
be doing a big effect

Scene where the general
wrestles a demon chicken.

We spent the past 45 minutes
arguing about a fake magazine.

I don't understand, do we want
to make this fucking schedule?

We're arguing about a magazine.

Lets just do it.

I don't just do
things on script.

I've got to film
something that works.

If it doesn't work,
I'm going to change it.

Because it had to be done.

Read the script first!

I don't just shoot scripts.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's just...
I should see.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's
decide what we're doing.

CAMERAMAN: Why are you guys
sitting out here right now?

Because there's nothing
happening in there.

We're waiting for people
to stop discussing why

A person would be
masturbating on a toilet

While people are outside in
the main dining area vomiting

All over the place.

GENERAL: Boy, you've
been relieved of duty.

Ahhh!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

Perfect.

Perfect.


CAMERAMAN: So what shot
are you guys about to do?

What's that?

CAMERAMAN: What shot are
you guys about to do?

The chicken fight.

CAMERAMAN: And how
does it work basically?

It's a pretty basic
system, right?

Yeah, this operates
the head and the neck.

And then these three pulleys
here operate the wings,

The eyes, and the mouth.

CAMERAMAN: So you're
basically controlling it

And making it look at though...

Yeah, well, we have
to switch puppets.

This is the stunt puppet.

Say hello, stunt puppet.

Hello.

And we kind of... we have a
puppet that actually moves.

And we use that
for the closeups.

And then this is
the fight puppet.

DIRECTOR: Bite.

Two can play at
this game, mister.

Aghhh!

DIRECTOR: Let it
get on your face.

Argggh!

Argggh!

DIRECTOR: Spit.
MAN: Shake it.

Shake it.

You're fed up with it.

DIRECTOR: Throw
it on the ground.

Ahhh!

Ahhh!

Arrrrgghhhh!

DIRECTOR: Wipe your face.


It was fun.

Lots of damn fun.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Kevin, how did it go?

It went really well.

I was actually really happy.

The timing went well.

It started oozing out
soapy bubbles at first

And then blasted through
this ridiculously

Dark, green, icky liquid.

It couldn't have gone better.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: And what did you
use to make the liquid, Tom?

Well, the liquid is food
dye, soap and lots of water

And lots of soap.

I mean, we have
bubbly... a bubbly mess.

Today is... today is
a very effects-heavy

Day with the scene.

We have Joe Fleischaker,
who is a great guy.

But, you know, he's got
some physical limitations.

But that's all
right just as long

As we follow sort of what Tom
wants, I think we could do it.

I have a feeling it's going
to go very smoothly today.

CAMERAMAN: Joe, are you
excited for your role today?

Oh, absolutely.

I'm looking forward to it.

1, 2, 3.

We have to indulge
the fans, you know?

That's the real
reason why I do it.

[Music playing]

Wow!

Jared.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Smile.

Mmm, big smile.

Open your eyes and smile... open.

All right, cut.

Now give me that low fat
sausage-flavor chicken

Meal with the General's
low-carb mashed potatoes.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again.

Now you give me that
low-fat, sausage flavored...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again.

Low fat mashed...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again.

Take a breath and do it now.

Don't get skimpy on the low...

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
All right, cut it.

Someone better go through
the lines with Joe.

This should have
been done last night.

MAN: Do we need to
get the stool for him?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No.

No, I don't need the stool.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No, let's
run to the next thing.

JOE FLEISCHAKER: Let's
do it one more time.

Man, you are an inspiration.

And you kept the weight off.

How did you do it?

It's all about
moderation, my boy.

Now you get my that low-fat
sausage-flavored chicken meal

With the General's
low-carb mashed potatoes.

Don't you even think of skimping
on the General's all-soy gravy.

JASON: You got it.

Do it once more.

Your pants have to be down.

Well, that's going to
be... I don't know how are

We supposed to... I was told...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: He can't
shit with his pants on.

Action and a shit.


Eat, and shit, eat.


Shake your head no.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: We just need
one shot from above, I think.

DIRECTOR: You don't
have to scream.

All you have to do is lie there.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

DIRECTOR: You can sleep.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
you can't sleep.

But you can be...

I have to be in pain.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Breathing.

Breathing and being...

DIRECTOR: You're not having
a heart attack, are you Joe?

I don't think so.

DIRECTOR: OK, good,
so you're just pink.

Yeah, just pink.

DIRECTOR: All right, if you're
really having a heart attack,

I'll take it serious.

Otherwise, fuck you.

OK.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Here we go.

No, seriously, if
you're in trouble.

I'm not in trouble.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, very good.

Ready?

I'm telling you that
I can't make it up.

Better put me back down.

Right here.
Ready.

Go ahead.
Go ahead.

1, 23.

Go ahead, Joe.

Yeah.

I'm good.

All right.

MAN: Get Joe's chair ready.


He crapped up the scene.

Joe was awful.

He was horrible.

He didn't even have his lines.

I'm never using him again.

Apparently, Yoshi
is walking off set.

What happened?

I don't know.

Who is walking off set?

GABE FRIEDMAN: Yoshi.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Why?

I don't know why...
Says I'm sarcastic.

I don't know why.

Seems to not the
way I talk to him.

This is my problem.

I'll deal with it.

GABE FRIEDMAN: All right,
so we don't have the shit...

BRENDAN FLYNT: No, you
don't have to do anything.

GABE FRIEDMAN: OK, great thanks.

Hey, come on, Yoshi.

Come on.
Yoshi.

That's not working, man.

Yoshi, no!

Yoshi.

Come on.

Come on, buddy.

Come on.

Stop it!

No, I'm serious.

You get that crap out of
your right now, buddy.

I'm serious.

Or I'll break the camera.

You don't do that shit.

You leave our men alone.

Brendan was fucking
running his mouth.

And finally Yoshi just snapped.

BRENDAN FLYNT: That's only twice
in about 70 movies I've done.

So it's not... it's not so bad.

CAMERAMAN: He was
definitely antagonizing him?

Oh, yeah.

CAMERAMAN: Brendan
was definitely

Was antagonizing him?

Yeah, Yoshi was saying,
getting away from me.

Don't talk to me.
Brendan was running his mouth.

Yeah, congrats, Brendan.

Good job.

Yoshi is a great
fucking guy, you know?

And I'm looking
forward to working

With him again... definitely
not with Brendan Flynt.

Like, if you see a documentary
about what when I quit,

Then you'll know why.

CREW: Roll camera.

DIRECTOR: Action on.

And shit.

Shit!

Ah, Shit!

Cut.
Cut.

Cut.

Cut, rename the shit.

Rolling and action, Ron.

Shit!

Shit!

Look at that shit.

Lower your legs.
Lower your legs, Ron.

Low.

Low.

Shit.

OK.

Cut it.

Cut it.

Now, oh, fuck.

It looked like a
fountain, right?

Yeah.

CAMERAMAN: Are we
behind schedule already?

Yes.
CAMERAMAN: All right.

DIRECTOR: Action on it.


No.

Cut.

Cut it.

Has somebody got baby wipes?

Baby wipes!

MAN: I've got baby wipes.

Hit the shower.

Here is a puppet
heat Joe Fleischaker

That has grips built into it
so we can grab a hold of it

And shrink him down.

Action... cut.

Deflate... go.

Cut.

You guys have to test all
the day is a total waste.

And it's 7 o'clock.

And you've got Arbie and Penny
and the other people here.

And their day is
wasted for no reason...

Just because people are too
fucking lazy to test stuff.

I took you word for it.

That this worked.

This is ridiculous.

And it's taking
us, you know, it's

Throwing us off another day.

I don't know how we're going
to shoot the singing now.

Joe Fleischaker's supposedly
turning inside out.

There's no way you can
tell what's going on.

You know, if they think that
Brendan was tough with Yoshi,

They ain't seen nothing yet.

I'll push every button
there is because, you know,

It's not worth it.

The movie is young people
and special effects.

That's all there is.

Yeah, Gabe says we got music.

That's going to solve the
special effects problem.

We shouldn't worry
because it's got music.

People go... people
are going to buy

Tickets because of the music.

Yeah, right.

Our fans are going
to... the music

Is something to be discovered.

We should rewrite.

That's what we should
be doing is rewriting.

Or get that thing on... get
on film so we see what it is.

I beg you to get this thing
on film... on tape rather.

I beg... I beg weeks,
and weeks, and weeks.

Andy should talk to Tom and
in no uncertain terms, right?

Andy you should talk to
Tom and get it straight...

Get that fucking test on
test... on screen, now.

BRENDAN FLYNT: Great, let me
rehearse the exit, please.

There's got to be a fucking
transformation from the General

To that thing.

There's got to be something
for people to look at.

It cannot be shot after shot
of spraying brown water...

Or spraying red water.

So far we've got
two scenes... one

Where red water sprays and
one where brown water sprays.

You guys have to film it.

You guys have to get Andy
as a producer and maybe Kiel

To speak with Tom.

That General thing is
Tom's responsibility.

I've said my peace.

I've said it.

I've been saying it for weeks.

You have to film it,
test it, or you get shit.

You get schlock.

You can talk all you want.

You can meet all you want.

Kaleb can be his
cocktail party nice guy.

But you've got to
get it on tape!

You've got to get it on tape.

I've said it for weeks.

Brendan said it nicely.

There's no other way to do it.

And I don't want to be
slightly diplomatic.

I wouldn't blame
if you walked out.

I wouldn't blame you one
bit if you walked out.

I would.

But there's no other way.

I don't care.

I'd rather you did
than have this again.

You film it and see it.

And it better be good.

I know I'm right.

I know I'm right.

I know I'm right.

I know I'm right.

I know I'm fucking right.

Action!

We did rehearse this
Carl Jr thing a lot.

So maybe this will go
better than yesterday.

CAMERAMAN: How ready
are you guys today?

It's smells like beyond ass.

And they left it out.

And like I found
spiders all over it.

So I don't know if
there is a spider

Nest living inside of it.

You have to stick
your hand in here.

And it's a puppet.

But I don't want to
stick my hand in there.

It's very nice.

Doesn't look like a chicken.

But I guess you know it's
a chicken because you

Saw it just a little while ago.

I mean, it looks like a whale.

It's got the eyes on the top.

It's got that mouth
that a whale has.

It's got that big filter
for plankton that's getting

And going after plankton.

Well, can we give
them a line, maybe?

People... people
react to that stuff.

MAN: Larry, what happened?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, maybe...
Yeah, what happened to you?

MAN: Larry, what
happened to you?

Well, what are you doing to me?

Maybe... Larry, what
are you doing to me?

Maybe that's the thing...
This cue for the bite.

Ahh!

Or has he already bitten you?


I don't know if you
remember Lloyd freaking

Out about Tom Devlin's effects.

Let them know that he's
going to get canned.

Send him back to LA.

And we'll have to
come up with our own.

That's the end of the movie.

So we went back to see his
test of the egg hatching

Of the general monster.

And it was unfortunately
less than impressive.

Right now it's just a guy and
then like some pulsating shit.

Then all of a sudden,
there's an egg

There or something like that.

So we have to redo all that.

It's got to be much more
brutal than what we saw.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No kidding.
DIRECTOR: Don't jerk.

Don't jerk.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't do that.

Just drink.

DIRECTOR: Let it
pour out by itself.

That's it.

[Music playing]

Now do a thing is if your
eyes were about to explode

Into the camera.

[Music playing]

DIRECTOR: Cut!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, yeah, Rose.


Seriously, like, I'm
going to pass out.

Thank you.

Cut.

Good, OK.

Thank you, Rose.

CAMERAMAN: You think
morale is real low on set?

Right now, yeah.

We need something fucking
great to boost it up... at least

Boost up the morales of our
keys because it sucks right now.

Anybody know what we're doing?

MAN: Ron Jeremy Ron Jeremy.

I have no idea.

Oh, Ron Jeremy comes tomorrow.

MAN: The crazy guy.

Ron Jeremy comes
tomorrow and very cool.

He's the crazy guy.

So the crew will be very happy.

The crew is... look
how happy they are.

I want to meet Ron Jeremy.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: He's cool.

I got to go buy some
porn now, though,

So he can sign it for me.

CAMERAMAN: Have they told you
about your role yet so far?

The only role
they told me about

Was a roll and butter, which
they have over there waiting

For me over at the coffee.

Yeah, I play kind of
a crazy man, which

Is great... the guy you see in
those movies warning you like

Go back... go back.

You know?

Let's say you got a couple
of horny and stupid friends

That want to go on a road trip
into the unmapped backwoods

Of America.

Take a look.

Two spare tires... one fully
charged cellphone with

Great range... with great range.

And a couple of guns.

Behold, I shall a
bury a sword upon you.

I shall devastate your
higher places. [Burp]

Oh, shit.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.



Don't lean forward too
much when you're screaming.

Yeah.

OK, that was great.

CAMERAMAN: Can we
have a quick shot?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Uh,
Caleb's pants came down.

Who is the pants wrangler?

KIEL: I am.

Kiel, please.

I told you to stand and
to pull up his pants.

It's only in the pants...

Kiel, now look, I want
you to listen carefully.

I told you... you standby
to pull up Caleb's pants.

Now pull them up.

Pull those pants up.

Pull my fucking pants up now!

Jesus.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Sorry,
Caleb, I apologize.

All right.
Come on.

I touched it.

I touched it.

Now, all right.

DIRECTOR: It's got to go over
his eyes... too much slime.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
we need a lot of it.

All right, let's
turn the cameras on.

It's going to go in his eye.

DIRECTOR: It's going to
go right in his eyeball.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It
didn't last time.

CREW: Well, he dumped
a shitload on there.

Ready?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, we're going.
Action!

Cameras!

CAMERAMAN: Yeah, rolling.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Chin up.
Chin up.

What are you doing?

Oh, oh, then we got to cut.

We got to cut.
We got to cut.

No, it's OK.
It's OK.

I can't... it's
no good like that.

GABE FRIEDMAN: It's all slime.
You can't see anything.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's got to be...

CREW: It's what we
were telling you.

It's like a boat.

Paper towels, please.

They can't see any
of the makeup now.

CREW: All right, never mind.

CAMERAMAN: How's it
going today so far?

It's fine.

CAMERAMAN: It's all right?

Yeah, a lot of waiting
around because I

Have just this one
little bit in the scene.

So it's, uh, interesting... it's
very... once you get slimed,

There's not much you can
do... just sit here and wait.

So it's Saturday.

And we're doing the
zombie mask scene,

Section A, which
is when everyone's

Faces get ripped off and stuff.

I think we got here at 9
o'clock in the morning.

It's now 1 o'clock
in the afternoon.

Gabe is really around...
Pissed of as hell

Because the effects
weren't ready.

We've got a million
zombies running around.

Half the people
here have turned up

Who aren't even supposed
to be here today

And asked if they could be in
a scene that's already been

Blocked out like six weeks ago.

So they've been made up as well.

So god knows what the fuck they
are going to do in the scene.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, it's in there
just knock them out.

Better than before.

CAMERAMAN: I don't
mean to alarm you.

But you might have
something on your face.

It's not yet.

It's a work in progress.

A little bit.

Like, I have to sort
look at an angle.

For some reason there's nothing
stuck to this side of my arm.

I don't know why.

They got someone to put
water in the Elmer's glue.

Unfortunately that person...
They don't remember

Who... couldn't
tell the difference

Between water and cream soda.

So every single person you
see with feathers on them

Is covered head to
toe in cream soda.

Who is the fucking asshole?

NICK: No one knows.

What are you doing?

My right arm.
Do it again.

My good arm.

Do it again, goddammit!

Do it fucking again.

Can you see blood?

Is he bloody?

CREW: Very bloody.
DIRECTOR: Roll it.

Roll it.

I just did my first
real effect in a feature

Film... Troma's "Poultrygeist."

And I didn't get yelled at the
entire three hours we shot.

Every single person
gets yelled at.

I don't know how
the hell I did it.

CAMERAMAN: How's it
going today so far?

Well, the effects
are looking great.

But the problem... maybe
it's not a problem.

But it's taking a long, long
time for the people sort

Of waiting in their makeup.

But they knew they were
going to be waiting.

And we just go out there,
keep them occupied,

And they are hanging in there.

I can handle it all afternoon...

Um, want a cigarette?

CAMERAMAN: So how do you
think today is going?

Oh, well, I've
been here 12 hours.

They haven't use me...
Or 10 hours or whatever.

They haven't used me.
So I pretty much...

CAMERAMAN: And how many
times has this happened

So far on this production?

I can't remember.

CAMERAMAN: Too many to count?

Yeah.

I think a lot of
things that goes

On with Troma outside of actual
shooting is unprofessional.

I made $100 for
all the work I do.

CAMERAMAN: For your
role in this film?

For my whole work.

CAMERAMAN: Wait, wait, wait.

Your role in this film...
Yep.

CAMERAMAN: every hour?
Uh-huh.

CAMERAMAN: Living here.

Moving here for the summer to
New York... you got paid $100?

$100.

CAMERAMAN: You got paid $100?

You want to know
what Kit gets paid?

Kit gets paid almost
double what Jason makes.

And Jason makes $900.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We need touchup.

CAMERAMAN: Total?

Total.

CAMERAMAN: Is it like per
something or just total?

Total... $100 for
the whole film.

CAMERAMAN: So do you not feel
appreciated on this film?

I feel...

CAMERAMAN: Or feel
underappreciated?

I feel... financially, yeah.

[Music playing]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let me see
people in the rear making out.

DIRECTOR: Go back to making out.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
People in the rear.

DIRECTOR: Melanie,
rub... rub yourself.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Now I
can't see anything.

DIRECTOR: Back to the
original position.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.
Position.

DIRECTOR: All right.
Oh!

OK, excuse me.

DIRECTOR: Cut.

Cut.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No more spraying.

Let's just do making out.
DIRECTOR: All right.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

There's no continuity
in this film.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: We
can't see your faces.

That's it.

There you go.

Perfect, now squirm with the
lube hit... a little tiny bit.

OK, good.

Now, and cut.

OK, very cool.

Very cool.
Thank you.

Thank you.

Here... in the ass.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Now quiet!

Get a wide shot.

You may want to add a few PAs.

Ready?

And action.


I'm not going to be
in this for six hours.

This is ridiculous,
especially when I can't see.

CAMERAMAN: I got to go.

Lloyd's flipping out.

All right, I'll be back.

Move it.

Move it.

Move it.

When can we look at something?

I see her coming
in and coming out.

What are you leading
her around for?

Where's Tessa?

You shoot it.

Shoot it.

Do you mind shooting it, please?

CAMERAMAN: Where'd she go?

Sorry you had to stay in
costume for seven hours or so.

Come in.

Do you mind be interviewed?

What happened?

Oh, you don't want it filmed?

All right, then don't film it.


I just want to get this
fucking shit over with.

Come down.

Tessa will be right here still.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, all right.
Where is she?

Have her sit there.

Put her there.

And then we're in good shape.

I know it's fattening.

But I love this flesh.

I love the squash, what?

WOMAN: You said
I love this part?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
I love the skin.

WOMAN: I love the skin?

Dammit.

Action!

Put your hands out...
Your right hand out.

All right, cut, cut, cut.

God dammit!

Action at that table, Jessica.

Action, Jessica!

I can't see anything.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Go
over to your right.

Now, stay up!

Fuck!

I know it's fattening.

But I love the
skin. [Evil laugh]

The biggest problem
with this stuff

Is you have amateur actors.

And when you have them, not
only do they screw up the movie,

But they screw up the shots.

MAN: Got it Lloyd?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
it was perfect.

[Music playing]



DIRECTOR: Ready?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

CREW: Slice.

Blood.

Slice.

Slice.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

DIRECTOR: Blood.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Get going
over the [inaudible].

CREW: Yeah, there's blood now.

DIRECTOR: All right, in the
sink... up... in the first dunk.

Up.

Second dunk.



Third dunk.

Leave him in.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Dunk him again.

Sorry, dunk him again.

DIRECTOR: One more time.

Ahh! [Bang]

DIRECTOR: Oh!

CAMERAMAN: Are you all right?

Of course he's not.

That's a nasty little cut.

I saw we skip this... go
to the next... don't do it.

CAMERAMAN: Let me see it.

What happened exactly?

Um, I'm not entirely sure.

But I was doing this stunt.

And I think I slipped.

Now, that's dedication.

What producers do you
know that sacrifice

Their own face for the movie?

Andy, she knows
exactly where it is.

Oh, great.

I'm actually getting
you to Sister's or ECMC.

The Sister's Hospital.

OK, you can be
in place... you're

Getting killed instead of Andy.

You're getting your
face deep fried.

I mean, yeah, your
face deep fried.

MARIA GISMONDI: So it's a rough
night in Tromaville, Buffalo.

Um, we have a
quadrillion people.

I think, actually, the
numbers close to 200 extras

Who have been here since 3:00
PM, who are in various stages

Of zombie makeup and dress.

We also have a cast and
crew who are basically,

At this point, at their wits
end, considering the fact

That all of us were here
until about 2 o'clock

In the morning last night.

And now, once again,
we're preparing

For about the same tonight.

We've got producers whose heads
are like exploding as we speak.

We have a... a director who... who
appears to be rapidly losing,

Um, sanity.

Don't tell me what I'm
doing and what am not doing.

I know what I'm doing.

And I know what I'm not doing.

Uh, Basically all of this.

And we've only got about...
About a very brief period

Of time left before we have to
get all of these shots wrapped.

And it's nearing
midnight now as we speak.

CAMERAMAN: So Allyson, how do
you feel about, uh, tonight?

How do you think
it's going to go?

Awesome.

It looks great.

You're trying to act like
a chicken like they are.

They are just going
to be doing like this.

They are minding
their own business.

And then you just walk
very quietly through there.

And you walk like a chicken.
[chicken sound] You're going

To be doing a little of that.

All right, keep going Allyson.

MARIA GISMONDI: Actually, this
is one of my favorite dances.

So... and I think this is one of
the people's favorite dances.

These guys have been amazing.

They've been rehearsing this
stuff when they don't have to.

They have been meeting
up outside of, uh, calls

To... to dance.

MAN: Oh, jeez.

That really bums me out because
we don't need to do this dance.

CAMERAMAN: It's not.

You never wrote it
into the script?

GABE FRIEDMAN: No.

We're going to be
in the basement.

The General Monster
Is going to come out.

And instead of
watching this one,

I cut to this for a
minute and a half.

GABE FRIEDMAN: No.
Yes.

GABE: No.

CAMERAMAN: What time
is it right now?

It's 1:32 AM.

CAMERAMAN: And how much more
do we still have to film?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Standing by.

[Music playing] Frightened human
faces... bodies strewn about.

Would you like a
last request before I

Peck your eyeballs out?

MARIA GISMONDI: 5, 6, 7, 8, 1.

Hey.

Good.

Hey.

Hey.

Draw a circle.

Deep out.

Pull in.

Circle.

Deep side.

Zombie.

CAMERAMAN: Where's
our DP right now?

The DPs not coming out.

If we can't film, what is the
purpose of your being here?

Unless you want to be here.

No no, no.

Your purpose is you got
to discuss the next scene.

You work on that, man.

Well, now he's coming.

Here he comes.

No, you're asking
us to eat cold pizza

And work for three more hours.

CAMERAMAN: Right.

And we haven't
eaten since 8:00.

You know what time it is?

CAMERAMAN: 4:00?

Yes.

Here's the choice.

We we can either wrap and then
get... or we can bring in some...

Try to get hot food here.

But it's not going to
be instant because they

Have to make the hot food.

BRENDAN FLYNT: I
understand that, yeah.

So we can keep working.

And then the hot food will come.

And when it comes, we
stop and eat the hot food.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: We'll stop
and eat the hot food, yeah.

And then we finish up.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No problem.

Or we can just wrap.

BRENDAN FLYNT: Whatever.

But I can't ask my crew...
No, no, I can agree with you.

To eat cold pizza and
keep working for three hours,

You know?

There's a diner
right down there

You can get like burgers
and fried for you guys.

Is that fine?
Whatever.

Come up with a plan
and propose it to us.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hot food.
When it comes, we break.

Meanwhile, we'll keep working.
I don't know.

I'm too tired to figure
out the catering.

That's not my job.

I'm DP.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Well, you want to...

If you want me to handle
catering, I'll leave the set

And handle it.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: You
want to keep working?

Don't you want me to
do this on the set?

Yes, let's keep doing this.

BRENDAN FLYNT: Or you
want me to do catering?

So I'll take... as long as
you don't mind like hamburgers

And french fries.

Can we do it?
Yeah, you know?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK,
I'll do the catering.

I'm 60 years old.

I haven't eaten all day.

So I don't know what
the big fucking deal is.

I got people here getting
paid nothing, having no food.

They seem OK.

Just to make a point...
I'll make a point later on.

[Music playing]
MARIA GISMONDI: Step.

Step.

Step up.

Step down.

Down up.

Together.

Hold in.


You can cut.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.
OK.

Thank you, everyone.

It's a wrap.

Thank you.

Thank you.


MARIA GISMONDI: Can I
get a group zombie hug?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was great.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Ross, you're scared.
You're scared.

Open your eyes.

Open your eyes.

Look out at your nose.

Cross your eyes.

Cross your eyes.

Cross them.

OK, now go down and get Anna.

Ahh, yeah.

You and Stacy at the
same time tomorrow.

I sure hope so.

Apparently that's what
Brendan came over to tell us.

The art department girl zombie
licking him on the neck.

Whatever.

It's tough times
out here in Buffalo.

Action!


Cut.

Nothing.

He went to the different spot.

The plate didn't go
where it was supposed to.

Just turn your head and scream.

Action!

DIRECTOR: Blood there.

Blood.

Cut, cut.

Guys, guys.

You just turned your head.

Unless you don't want to do it.

If there is some
reason you don't

Want to do it, no problem.
I want to do it.

It's not as easy as you think.

Well, it is easy as I think.

I've been doing it for 30 years.

You haven't.

Now this is just a
temporary situation.

I got all that down.

It's hopeless.

You're going to have
to break this up.


DIRECTOR: Action!
Turn there.


DIRECTOR: Blood
out of your mouth.

Cut.

OK, well.

DIRECTOR: If he hold himself
up, he's controlling it.

Fucking, we stop
casting retards, right?

Seriously.

He wasn't a retard before.

[Music playing]

Not in my face.

Not in my face.

DIRECTOR: 1, 2, 3, pull.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Not that
much... less movement.

Just jiggle your feathers
a little bit, OK?

Oh, thank god.


JUSTIN BIVENS: We have live
gunfire going on today.

It's very dangerous.

People cannot be moving in
and out of the area where

The filming is going to be.


We can't make
exceptions for anybody.

Buffalo Police said we cannot
shoot a gun unless the people

Who are operating the
guns do it in front

Of us and learn how to do it
and learn the proper protocol.

So last night when
we were shooting,

I said, Lloyd, you
have to come at 7:00 AM

To test out the guns.

I said, fuck that.

I'm not coming at 7:00 AM.

Fuck that.

Someone else will
shoot the guns.

I gave him a very
polite wake up request.

Lloyd, get your fucking
ass down here goddammit

Or we're shutting you down.



LLOYD KAUFMAN: There's
always the guns jam.

And they suck whether
it's center firearms

Or whether you have the
best gunman in the world,

You know, they always
jam no matter what.

CAMERAMAN: Do you think the guns
are being handled correctly?

I'm handling them.

CAMERAMAN: Yeah?

Yeah, they're good.

CAMERAMAN: [inaudible]

Everything is fine.

You're shooting
zombies in the head.

And we have little
pipes going in here.

And they come out
of the head here.

All right, I just need
to know that this one,

This one, and this one.

The ones that have
squibs on them.

It's all right.

CREW: Can I have the sponge?

[Music playing]



The squibs aren't good.

They are just a spray.

You don't see it on film.

It's not... it's not effective.

It's like a mist.

And the cameras see
right through it.

CAMERAMAN: Do you think
any part of that's usable?

Any part of that last shoot?

[Saw sound]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Open the
beak... the beak and eyes.

Don't see any... doesn't
look like it's alive.

This is, uh, retarded work here.

And it's taking...
We finished lunch

Hours ago... cut stuff out.

So there's got to be
other stuff to cut out.

Do the General's transformation
and end the movie.

So we should finish this
fucking thing on the 26th.

That's it.

So you guys figure
out what's important.

And then finish it.

We've got no money left.

No, we don't have money left.

So we've got to finish it.

GABE FRIEDMAN: The
reason we're off schedule

Is because of extra...
Extraneous shit

That he adds like a fucking
dance number that's not

In the script at 4:00
in the morning, which

Throws or schedule off balance.

Cut out the kid... cut out...
You know, just skip the kid.

What do we need the kid for?
Cut it out.

Right?
I mean, look, this is absurd.

TIM CRONIN: Fight
choreography is

Fucking... it's been
slashed and beaten

And thrown out the window.

CAMERAMAN: So you did
all this work for what?

For this... get this.

CAMERAMAN: Whoa.

MAN: Get that shit?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: So Tom is
going to give us a talk

Now on what's coming
out of what orifice.

Yeah, a little bit.

CAMERAMAN: Is that OK
to have dry ice coming

Out that close to the face?

Why not?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

Roll cameras.

Action.

Jiggle, you die, Caleb.

Is smoke coming out?

Is stuff coming out of him?

Keep doing it.
Smoke.

We need the smoke.

And that's the stuff
coming out of his cheeks.

Your beaks.

Your beaks.

Your beaks.

The beak... and cut.

It looked very... it
looked like nothing.

I didn't see it.
It looked like nothing to me.

Well, hold it.

When does he die,
too... the alcohol...

Nothing came out of
his mouth or his beak.

It all came down his sides.

GABE FRIEDMAN: The tube
with the smoke fell out.

And you weren't listening.

Oh, you should
have yelled it out.

I was screaming it.

I was so looking forward to
today because it's so much

Easier than being [inaudible].

Y'all cut.

GABE FRIEDMAN: You all cut.

You both flipped out.

No, and then so what?

We...

The tube fell out.

The tube fell out.

The tube has fallen out.

You got to put up
with us flipping out.

Because then you say
why you said that.

I don't know how you
couldn't understand

When I was screaming.

I don't hear you.

It was [mumbling] and the
cameras is whirring around.

That's why he said cut.

Yeah cut you understand
or stop or something.

Cut means cut.

Or emergency or something.

Yeah, you might have to put
up with us yelling at you.

But then afterwards
you explain why.

Then we say OK.

It's just a fucking
excuse, right?

Someone could have said
it properly, right?

You aren't making this easy.

I heard you say, I said,
yes, I know the tube fell out.

I'm going to just go on anyway?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: (ON
CAMERA) Cut, cut, cut.

OK.

Oh, shit, when did it fall out.

Now, I do whatever
is next, please.

The tube fell out.

We got eight people saying it.

DIRECTOR: (ON CAMERAS)
We're going to the arm now.

I don't see that.

I still don't see it.

There I never heard
him say that either.

Oh, come on, seriously.

I didn't.

I didn't.


This is Troma plays
with death... number 37.

And why is that?

Well, because if
this water comes

Through into the electrical
thing, the whole thing blows.

CAMERAMAN: Still have that
nice, little blankets up there.

Yeah, that's a quick fix.

But we're investigating
a permanent fix.

Can you get a broom up here?

CAMERAMAN: A broom up here.

Yeah, this one's awful.

CAMERAMAN: We need a broom.

Somebody bring a
broom to the back.

Good work, Kiel.

I didn't do that.

Thanks for locking it up.

Weren't you supposed
to lock it up.

I did.
It's your responsibility.

Hey, asshole.

Stay the fuck off the
mic while we're rolling.

CAMERAMAN: You want to answer
that because I got cursed that.

MAN: What did he say?

CAMERAMAN: He
said, hey, asshole.

Stay the fuck off the mic
while we're recording.

There it is.

Andy.

CAMERAMAN: Figure out what
your real face looks like.

Yeah.

CAMERAMAN: How
many days in a row

Have you been in this business?

Mmm.

10, 11, 12?

I don't know.

I lost track.

CAMERAMAN: So you've been
going at this for a good week

Now being a chicken zombie.

Yeah, underneath it all.

But, uh, and became
accustomed to it.

So... it became
very... it actually

Started to become comfortable.

I started to get
used to photographing

And being a zombie was...

But the cool thing is
when I asked him today

Rather him saying,
oh, I'm so tired,

And it's itchy, and all that.

He says, I'm great.

I'm great.

And then that's the
mood of the whole group.

It's so wonderful.

It's such a nice,
uplifting experience,

Even for a broken down,
drunken, old, low budget

Filmmaker like me.

CAMERAMAN: How are
enjoying your job?

I'm ready to ride.

I think I didn't know
what I was getting into.

Lack of sleep... lack of food.

18 hours day, seven days a
week... sleeping on the floor

With 50 people... not showering.

CAMERAMAN: No one talked
to you about the way

Troma was before you
came to work on the set?

No.

No, they manipulated me.

CAMERAMAN: And you're
saying you don't

Like living in a
run-down McDonald's

In the middle of the ghetto?

With a hose for a shower?

And no potty for pooper?

And no sink?

CAMERAMAN: Think
you'll ever be back...

Fuck no.

CAMERAMAN: for another movie?

This battle is not for me.

I got some coffee.

I got a decent amount of
sleep last night... more than I

Got in the past two days.

A lot of love in the air today.

We're going to make
a decent fucking

Movie... not a good
movie, not a bad movie,

But a decent fucking movie.

Fucking General monster, dude.

This is the fucking
apex of the movie.

The hardest thing to do is
like being in a creature suit

And be directed because
you can hardly hear... you

Can hardly do any motion.

So of course we chosen
the person on the set who

Can speak the worst English.

Oh, it's a camera.

CAMERAMAN: How's it going?

It's that suit pretty hot?

Super-hot.

Super... it... when it's...

Why do they pick a French guy?

He comes out.

He's like this.

And then we cut.

Tell him that.

Do that.

Otherwise he's
going to do nothing.

I believe that he is doing
that but [speaking french]

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Look at
the right because that's

Where the heroes will get...

DIRECTOR: 1, 2, 3, action.

[Speaking french]

DIRECTOR: Action!

CREW: [speaking french]

Just I was afraid because
of the hat because she fell,

You know?

And that's why I am not
completely satisfied.

But it's OK.
I love it.

Yeah, it's really great.
CAMERAMAN: No, no.

Looked pretty good, man.

Looked pretty good, man.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: When you're
making low-budget movies,

It's very hard to find
old people... I mean,

Mature people who can act.

And if they are any good,
there in the union or they're

Successful.

And in this particular
part of old Arbie,

It's fairly physical.

Ah!

You have to wear this
mask and, uh, makeup.

And so there are probably no
old person who could do it.



BRENDAN FLYNT: There's supposed
to be smoke here, I think.

CREW: Did you unplug it?

CREW: We're about to use it.

CREW: Oh, OK.

How could you
not laugh with us?

Like a ballerina.

CAMERAMAN: Allyson, you
look beautiful today.

Did you do something
with your hair?

Cut your hair?

Why are you putting the
plastic bag over your head?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Quiet!

Shut the fuck up.

To the bases.

Let's go!


Get up high in the back.

Get up high.

That's it.

Lots of chicken... chicken too.

Chicken.

You're not doing
chickens, folks.

I don't know.

I'm freaked out.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: They're
not even made up.

They are not attempted
to be made up.

Can you get somebody
with black...

CREW: This?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: No, not that.
The black stuff.

DIRECTOR: What
camera roll is this.

You guys should
be watching this.

We do it every night, every day.

I say watch the thing.

It's the scene featuring
zombies reaching.

And they all have these
hands that are white as snow.

Make sure to
fuck up their hair,

Then the undersides
of their arms,

And the backs of their necks.

And if we're in a big hurry,
then maybe if everyone

Is not done, there's a reason.

But these people have been here
since 2:00 in the afternoon.

So the thing we just did.

It's going to look
like a student movie.

But I'm not re-shooting
it because we

Don't have enough film.

MAN: [inaudible]

Good.

All right, go away.

Maybe you and the priest
go because my guess

Is we're going to get very
little done on our scene.

And, uh, I'm so concerned
you may be uncomfortable.

What do you think?

What time is it?

It's 12:40.

Yeah, it's just I'm fearful
that we won't make it.

And then you'll
be uncomfortable.

Lloyd, I've been in this
for 12 hours already.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, but why
not get an hour and a half...

Why not do it tonight?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I don't think
we're going to make it.

ALLYSON: Yeah, it's your call.

Look, there's no
attempt being made.

Caleb is here watching like
as if he saw a car wreck.

And, uh, and they are
not doing... I just

Have a feeling it's been
like this all night.

There's no movement.

I think it's wise to do that.

Yeah, maybe next time if you're
going to put flour, water,

Peanuts, dirt, and shit,
literally, with gnats and stuff

In someone's hair,
maybe think three days

In advance instead of three
days after to use a wig.

Looks like a punk, feels like
a sneaker... ch, ch, ch, chi!

Ch, ch, ch, chia motherfuckers!

Yeah!

Ha!

Ha ha!

Woo!

Hoo!

Woo!

Yeah!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, now
you have your celebration.

It's not stopping.
Wait.


I can't get it to stop.

I didn't know this thing locks.

So I put it in lock.

And I didn't know
how to turn it off.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, action.

CREW: But it has to be...

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

OK.

CREW: But it has to be her.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, I agree.

But who knows.

I just don't [inaudible]
you never know.

Oh, god, Wendy,
that is just sick...

Having sex with a corpse?

CREW: He thought she was dead.

A corpse is... a corpse is...

CREW: No, it's not.
It just lays there.

It does nothing.
A dead person can walk.

He's a very stupid guy.

I think it's a funny line.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: That
makes no sense.

GABE FRIEDMAN: Neither
does a penis chicken.

Well, are you OK with this?

And the master if it squirts?

She does not want to
do the penis monster?

CAMERAMAN: Why not?

WOMAN: She thinks
it's too gross.

It's pornographic and
demeaning to women.

And I just... I mean, I'm not
the biggest feminist on earth,

But like...

CAMERAMAN: No.

I have my limits, I guess.

CAMERAMAN: No, no, no.

That's understandable.

After much conversation,
she said that she'll do it

As long as no cum
gets in her face...

Maybe the boobs... around the
head... nothing in the face.

That way at least her
parents will respect her.

CAMERAMAN: What's the solution
that they came up with?

The solution is to have it
happen to Jason instead of me.

CAMERAMAN: Seriously?
Mhm.

CAMERAMAN: OK.

It comes out.

It's still going to leak green
vaginal fluids, of course.

And then nothing happens
until Arbie comes in

And it says, oh, my god.

Get off my girlfriend.

And he grabs it.

And he says, get
off my girlfriend.

How can I get you off?

I think it'll be funnier.

And it still we be in bad taste.

But it won't be
just misogynistic,

Which we don't want.

Ah!

I will get you off!

Maybe I need to beat you off.

Oh, it's going to
be greenish, right?

It's not going to be white.

KIEL: Yeah, it's got
to be covered in slime.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: What's
coming out of it's mouth?

Milk.

No, come on.

Puts some color in it.

Why is it milk?

CREW: OK, green then.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, green milk.

GABE FRIEDMAN: Dude,
let's just shoot.

Fuck you.

Come on.

It's not a porno film...
You sophomoric people.

I told you green.

Green is a chicken color
unless they are shitting,

In which case it has corn in it.

You have to have rules
in these things, right?

Are you rolling?

This is totally
my favorite scene.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

I kill myself so that
democracy can survive.

May Allah bless America.

I kill myself so that
democracy can survive.

I kill myself so
democracy can survive!

LLOYD KAUFMAN: You look
like you're embarrassed.

You want some tips?

Like that.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Try
it again, please.

Dancing.

faces, bodies strewn about.

Would you like a
last request before I

Peck your eyeballs out?

I'm a professional dancer.

I know what to do.

[Music playing] You white
devils are a vegan breed.

You know that love
just step in greed.

But I love Arbie, yes it's true.

They do the chickens.

We love them too.

I think it's important.

I think somehow... no,
that was good, Faith.

The only time it
looked bad was when

You weren't doing something.

She was awful.
In half the scene.

She would be just be
sitting there like this...

Like a pipe cleaner doll.

[Music playing] Would
you like a last request

Before I peck your eyeballs out?

Mr. Chicken, I
have a confession.

Before our bones,
you start mashing.

Can't you see that
we're in love?

Sorry, I don't give a fuck.

We just came to cluck shit up.

You show no love
for the redskin man.

You came, you saw,
you raped our land.

Home run, KW.

Home run.

Are you giving me
the beak or the claw?

I don't know which one
I'm supposed to give you?

CREW: It's going to
start out with a closeup

Of his fingernails digging
for a scratch and popping off.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I think
we're not exactly...

Looks like something...

BRENDAN FLYNT: The
General blew up.

Supposedly the General blew up.

And it just went
[explosion sound]

Blood all over, right?

Yep.

So it can blow up right here.

That's fine.

He's going to blow!

That was anti-climactic.

We just made a company
move to our flat plain

Which Brendan wants.

The way Brendan is
going to shoot it,

It's going to look
they are driving.

He's going to frame out
this off the ground.

If you see a tree or a
house, then obvious the car

Is not moving.

So we angle the car so that my
camera angle will get more sky

And not see the treeline.

I'm not sure how you make
a car look like it's moving.

Let's have someone tell the
kid to let her sip the stuff.

Or pretend to sip it or chug it.

And then just crush
it with your hand.

No, don't crush it.
OK, don't crush it.

No noises.

Now, these we
put it on a dolly.

And we just rock it back
and forth a little bit

To look like we're driving
next to it as it's moving.

Never look right.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Because
we are perfectionists,

We are going to re-shoot
in the graveyard.

And it shows you
that we are serious.

We want to really make
the scene, uh, good.

We end where we began.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: And action.

[Music playing]

It felt like I was on "Oz."

I felt violated.

I'm glad it worked.

I hope it was in focus.

Uh, is that focused?

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
I don't know yet.

John, you got to keep
your feet planted.

Oh, fuck.

CAMERAMAN: So how are
you feeling today, Lloyd.

Oh, very good.
Thank you very much.

How are you?

CAMERAMAN: I'm good.

Yep.

CAMERAMAN: Excited about today?

We still have a
final... final surprise.

On the last day.

All we have to do is film two
seconds of this stupid fucking

Shithole.

I was minding my own
business shaving this morning.

And I get a phone
call of Andy saying,

I have some disturbing
news for you.

GABE FRIEDMAN: Lloyd,
do you want to see this?

Hello, yes, Andy, what?

What?

Today's the day that we had
to do the establishing shots

Of the American Chicken Bunker
and the exploding building

With the matt shot... the same
thing we did in "Toxi IV"

Where you take a
photo of the building

And you line it up with
the actual building.

Then you blow it up.

But this morning, I got a call
from Ryan who said that when

He woke up, the sign was gone.

And it turns out
that the man who

Installed them decided to
take them down and figured we

Were done.

What the heck... why
did you take it...

Who told them to take it down?

Why did the guy
take the sign down?

What gave him the
idea to take it down?

Whose bright idea was that?

Which efficient
Troma person told

Them to take the sign down when
we're going to be shooting it?

This was supposed to
be very quick, easy day.

And as everything
goes in Tromaville,

It's completely fucked.

We've used different actors.

We got a kabuki car that's
got a different color.

It doesn't matter.

Nobody is going to be
looking for a sign, right?

They are just going to
see a place blow up.

People want to see
things blow up.

So let's make it happen
no matter what, please.

So the sign is
40 feet by 5 feet.

It weighs more than
Joe Fleischaker.

And um...

CAMERAMAN: And you've
got to sit on this thing.

The corner of the thing.
It's on the corner.

We're breaking it.

We're breaking it.

There's literally no support.

I mean, you drop.

Look... look how fast
that thing flies.

MAN: Yeah, I know.


Beautiful.

OK, I got it.
Got it.

Got it?

Great.

Yeah, thank you.

BRENDAN FLYNT: OK, listen up.

For the...

Quiet everybody.

BRENDAN FLYNT: Listen up for
the explosion, all right?

I was trying to think.

Just do two.

Just break it up.

And put the powder in it.

No, no, no.

If you light it like that.


BRENDAN FLYNT: Still
didn't blow it up.




BRENDAN FLYNT: Action.


Bam!


CREW: Ah, you made Brendan jump.


That's a wrap.

That's a wrap.


All right, everyone,
that's a wrap.


That's a wrap on
principal photography.


Good job.

Thank you.

I try.

Let's get freaky.


CAMERAMAN: That's a a wrap.

Sweet.

CAMERAMAN: Just want to go home?

I just want to go home.

[Music playing]

Now get out of my
face, Andy Kelerman.

ANDY: Thanks, Evan.

I refuse to believe
you're rolling.

This isn't really
interesting at all.

It's a camera on.

It's behind the scenes...
Filming behind the scenes.

CAMERAMAN: Check this out.

[Music playing]
