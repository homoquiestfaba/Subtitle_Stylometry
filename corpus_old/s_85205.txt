Check, please.

Look, Daddy,
a volcano.

It's very pretty.
Now drink up your volcano.

All right. We're going.
Mommy's waiting.

Daddy, please.
Just one more minute.

No. We're going.
No.

Yes. Yes.
No.

No.

Until I ended up
flatlining at the hospital.

But I survived.
And instead of
letting that scare me,

I kept on going.

Until...

my first daughter
was born.

And now,
I look at my girls...

and my husband,

who has been standing
by me for so long.

Think which one
you're gonna pull out.

I always think, man.
No, you don't.

They didn't lock you up this time
'cause you're not 18 yet.

Next time, they're gonna
lock you up, brother.

Come on.

Well, you're not thinkin'.

Stealing might get you money,

you can tap
some cheerleader's ass,

you can show off riding
in some pickle-colored Thunderbird,

but tell me what's gonna happen
if you shoot a pregnant woman
or an old man, huh?

<i>[Liquid Pouring]</i>

You know what'll happen?

The guilt will suck you
down to the bone.

Stealing ain't worth it.

Going to church,
reading the Bible...

and believing in Jesus, brother,
that's your ticket.

Yeah.

You think
it's a fantasy, right?

Huh?

Come here, man.
Get up. Come here.

<i>[Traffic Noises]</i>
See that truck?
Beauty, isn't it?

[Horn Honks]
I won it
at a friend's raffle.

No shit.
No shit.
You know what?

It wasn't luck.
It was Jesus who wanted me
to have that truck.

That's bullshit.
I bet you stole it.

Jesus gave me that truck.

And as He who gives
and He who takes away.

Yeah, right.
He doesn't give a shit
about us.

Come back.
Come back.

Take off the hat.

Take off that hat.

God even knows
when a single hair
moves on your head.

You're wrong, Nick.

<i>[Machines Beeping]</i>

[Man Thinking]
So, this is death's waiting room.

These ridiculous tubes.

These needles swelling my arms.

What am I doing
in this pre-corpse club?

What do I have to
do with them?

<i>I don't know when</i>
<i>anything began anymore...</i>

or when it's gonna end.

Who will be the first
to lose his life?

He, in the coma?

Or me?





<i>[Paper Crinkling]</i>

<i>[Clattering]</i>

All right.
You can get dressed now.

<i>Your Fallopian tubes</i>
<i>are severely damaged.</i>

<i>It, uh, looks like you had</i>
<i>some kind of an infection...</i>

<i>that, uh, wasn't taken</i>
<i>care of properly.</i>

We can try surgery,
but I have to tell you,
I think, uh,

the probabilities
are pretty slim.

Look.

Excuse me for asking this,
but it's important
that you tell me the truth.

<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>had an abortion?</i>

Yes.
<i>Any reason?</i>

I had already separated
from my husband
when I got pregnant,

and l...
No. I meant
a medical reason.

My husband's dying.
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

Paul, my husband,
he's dying,

and I want to have his baby.

<i>We can operate then</i>
<i>and hope you get pregnant</i>
<i>within three or four months.</i>


He's got one month left,
at most.

How'd it go?
Not good, Reverend.

<i>In one ear,</i>
<i>out the other.</i>

Be patient.
All it takes is one sheep
in a thousand, Jack. Come on.

Afternoon, Reverend.
Hey, Wolf, you still having
that birthday party Wednesday?

My place, brother.
Cool.

I may be late, Jack.
I have Bible class on Wednesday.

What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

<i>[Arguing Continues]</i>

I will hurt you, boy.
Paul. Paul!

Back off.
Back off.

I told you to think.
Fuck you!

Hit me! Hit me!
Hit me! Hit me!
Jack! Jack! Jack!

Hey, hey, Jack!
Come on! Come on!

Leave it, Jack.
He's a kid, Jack.

He's a punk, Reverend.
No, he's a kid.

<i>You think, Jack.</i>
<i>You think.</i>

<i>[Man On Radio]</i>
<i>Those who are making decisions</i>
<i>that affect our life,</i>

<i>we must call out to God</i>
<i>to give them His wisdom.</i>

Daddy's home.
I'll see you tomorrow, Tam.

I'll pick the boys up after school
if you want me to.

<i>[Door Opens,</i>

<i>[Girl] Daddy!</i>

Hello.
Hey, babe.

How's my queen?
<i>[Wife Chuckles]</i>

And Hercules.
<i>[Girl]</i>
<i>You don't have a queen.</i>

Freddy, help me out.

I got the cooler
from the religious center.
Good.

Dad, are we gonna
go buy a dog now?
Help me out.

Freddy, we agreed no dogs.
Grab the other handle.
Lift it up.

You said if I got good grades,
you'd buy me one.

Your sister has allergies,
and dog hair is bad for her.

Bad for her, not me.
Get me a dog.

Freddy, leave it alone.
Well, at least
get me a hamster.

Well, we'll see.
We'll see.

You always say
you promise.

[Chattering, Echoing]

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Hey, Wolf.</i>
<i>You back, motherfucker?</i>

Six down!

Whoo! I win.

You're such
a sore loser.

<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

Do you wanna go

Oh, for fuck's sake, Paul.

You know if they find out

off the transplant list.

<i>If I don't smoke,</i>

Jack, boss wants to talk to you.
He wants to see you now.

<i>Come on. We both know</i>
<i>I'm not a caddie yet,</i>

but I'm working at it.

And I'm learning, Brown.

Man, I swear to God,
I'm not going to let you down.

No, Jack,
that's not the problem.
What's the problem?

The problem is some members
have started complaining
about your tattoos.

I got a long-sleeved shirt.
No, man...
No long-sleeved shirt...

You can't see it.
Is gonna cover that one
on your neck right there.

You're gonna
start wearing a scarf.

Look, Jack.
This club is for people
different from me and you.

No. You know, I don't drink.
I don't steal.

I'm clean.
Tell me, why me?

Look, I know you're clean.
That's why I hired you.

But this decision
comes from the administration.

If I don't follow through,
they're gonna fuck me too.

Look, I cut you
a hefty severance check,

and you can pick it up
on the way to the cashier's.

Try to understand.

[Ice Cubes Rattling]

<i>Okay. Good.</i>
<i>So, is there any pain?</i>

My head hurts a little bit.

That's normal.
That's because of
the blood pressure medicine.

We'll get you something else
to make you feel better.

Thank you.
I brought...

what you asked for.
Oh, my God.

Oh. Is that my heart?

The culprit.

Which one is he?

That's him
with the brown vest.

<i>He's putting the bag</i>
<i>up on top right now.</i>

You okay?

[Breathing Heavily]
Come here.

I wanna kill him.

We have to kill him.

Thank you, Lord,
for keeping us together,

<i>for filling us with love</i>
<i>and for giving us this meal.</i>

Amen.
Amen.

I got fired
from the club today.

'Cause of your
good pal Brown, right?

<i>He had nothing</i>
<i>to do with it.</i>
It's mine!

<i>Believe that, Jack?</i>
Yes, I do.
[Children Arguing]

Ow!
Freddy, stop it.

Mommy, Freddy
hit me in the arm.
Which arm, baby?

This one.
Jack, don't start.

Hold out your other arm
and let your brother hit you.

Give me it!
Jack, no!

Hold it out.

Whoever slaps you
on the right cheek,
turn the other to him also.

Hit her.
Don't be afraid.

<i>Jack, no!</i>
<i>[Pounds Table]</i>
<i>Hit her!</i>

<i>Isn't that great. Wonderful.</i>
<i>Great parenting, Jack.</i>

Good job.
It's okay. Shh.

He didn't hurt her.


There's no hitting
in this house.

Understand?

Get in the corner!

Do I put the chocolate chips
in now, Mommy?

That's right, honey,
and then stir.

<i>[Radio, Indistinct]</i>
Stir really quick.

Laura, put that back.
Come on.

When is Daddy coming?
Soon. Now let's
get this finished, honey.

Mmm!
None for you.

<i>Mmm!</i>

No, Laura, stop it now.
[All Laughing]

Next Friday, ask Lupe
to stay the night.

I can't stay, 'cause I invited
the company managers
over for dinner.

I fired her.

What, you fired her?
Why?

She made me feel
like a cripple.

Oh, goddamn it, Paul.

So, now who's going
to cook for you?

Who's going to clean up after you?
Who's going to take care of you?

Who?
<i>I can do it for myself.</i>

<i>Oh, you can do it</i>
<i>by yourself.</i>

I can't do it anymore, Paul.

Really, I can't.

What are you doing?

I'm just... What?
What does it feel like
I'm doing?

Don't. Don't.
You might hurt yourself.

I'm not gonna
hurt myself.
Besides, I need you to...

Huh?
I went to
a fertility clinic.

Oh good, more doctors.
Mary, I can't have
this discussion again.

No, this is a...
this is a specialist.

He said that with surgery,
I might get pregnant.

You need to donate
sperm and then...
<i>Mary, no.</i>

<i>I could take care ofhim.</i>

But I can't.
So what's the point?

This is what I most want

<i>Yeah.</i>
Whose heart do I have?

<i>Uh, I can't tell you.</i>
<i>It's hospital regulations.</i>

Just like the donor's family
doesn't know your name either.

But you know.
[Chuckles]
Yes.

This is your heart now.
That's all that should
matter to you.

I wanna know who saved my life.
<i>If you want, you can write...</i>

an anonymous letter to the family

Personally, I think it's better
that you don't know.

Mrs. Peck?
I'm Dr. Jones.

What happened

Please, sit down.

No, l-I'm okay.
What happened?

Well, your husband

were hit by a car,

and we had to perform
emergency surgery on your husband.

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Your husband suffered</i>
<i>multiple skull fractures,</i>

<i>and we had to remove blood clots</i>
<i>from around the brain.</i>

He's in critical condition,
and we're concerned that
he's showing low brain activity.

What?
Is he gonna be all right?

We're doing the best we can.

<i>And what about</i>
<i>my daughters?</i>

Your youngest daughter
was brought in with severe bleeding.

She just wasn't able
to get here in time.

I've been feeling shitty
about what went down.

Come on.
I understand.

So, what do you say?

As you know, the doctors
did everything they could
to save your husband's life,

but he has shown
no brain activity.

We're here to help you
with some of the final decisions
that need to be made.

We have a patient...

who is gravely ill.

I'm here to give you
some information
on organ donation.

Are you willing
for your husband

I can give you time to discuss it,
but this is a decision
that needs to be made soon.

But, sweetie,

no, that's a lie.

Why does everyone have to
know our private life?

I'm not going to do anything.

Y... This guy was...
was some ex-con.

Are you really gonna let him
just walk the streets?

What do you want me to do?

Well, he ran over
Michael and your daughters.

Nothing I can do
is going to bring them back.

<i>Do you get that?</i>

Hey, how you doin'?

You found it okay?
Yeah, I did.

The donor's name
was Michael Peck.
He was 37 years old.

An architect
and married.

This is the authorization
for transplant signed by
his wife, Cristina Williams Peck.

I have a copy
of the medical report
if you care to see it.

And I also have the widow's
phone number and address
just in case you're interested.

How did Michael Peck die?

You might have seen it
in the newspaper.

This guy named JackJordan
ran over Mr. Peck
and his two little girls...

<i>October 10</i>
<i>at 6.;50 p.m.</i>

This JackJordan's a piece of work.
He's been in and out of jail
since he was 16.

Car thief,
small-time crook, drugs,

bad checks, alcoholism.

Last time he was in jail
has only been a few years ago.


You feeling okay, Mr. Rivers?

This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

Okay, I just, um...
You want some water?

He was, uh, an architect.

What's the point
in getting involved?

Mary, I wanna know
who I am now.

I don't think
that's the way to do it.

What is then?

<i>Look for it with me.</i>

Let's look ahead together,
not behind.

Damn it, Jack, it's your birthday
and you didn't even have
one drink with me.

Why don't you come over to my place?
I'm having a party.

Yeah, I bet they're all
as boring as you are.

You'd be surprised.
No, man, I'll pass.

Listen, I'll call you later
about that job, okay?

All right, man.
All right.

Thank you.

<i>[Horn Honks]</i>

Hey, Brown, you should.

I will.


<i>Okay, now, we can schedule</i>
<i>the surgery, um,</i>

I could get you in
as early as Monday.

Yeah.
<i>9.;00 a.m.?</i>

What's the percentage chance
that Mary will get pregnant?

<i>Well, I can't offer you</i>
<i>a real number on that.</i>

Um, you know,
there's the damage
from the abortion...

<i>that wasn't handled properly</i>...
<i>the blockage</i>...

<i>[Paul]</i>
<i>What abortion?</i>

<i>What abortion, Mary?</i>

I can explain.
Explain what?

There is an explanation.
Uh-huh.

All that drama
about artificial insemination.

Kids' names.

You got pictures
of our friends' babies
all over the place.

Why?

So you can flush it
down the fuckin' toilet?

We've been a fraud
for a long time, Mary.

Oh, yeah?
Why didn't you tell me that
when you were sick, huh?

Or did you expect
one of your girlfriends
to come and take care of you?

You came back
because you wanted to.
Don't blame me for that.

I came back to take care of you
because I love you.

Or because
you were feeling lonely.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I can't keep going like this.

The insemination,
the child.

It's like we're trying to
put a Band-Aid on something
that's just been bled dry.

It's finished.

But it... it isn't finished
if we give it a chance
and have this baby.

When we could have,
you didn't want to.

We were separated, goddamn it!
It's different now!

Yes, it's different.

We gonna go?
You only know how
to think about yourself.

<i>[Guard]</i>
<i>Close six!</i>

Well, thanks
for finally seeing me.

They tell me
you don't want to eat.

I'm not hungry.

Jack, Jesus didn't come
to free us from pain.

He came to give us
the strength to bear it.

Maybe He wanted
this pain for me.

<i>No, He had nothing</i>
<i>to do with this.</i>
<i>It was an accident.</i>

No, it wasn't an accident.

Jesus chose me for this.

Jack,

ask for the mercy
ofJesus Christ.

If it was an accident,

why do I have to ask
for His mercy?

"I will have mercy
on whom I will have mercy.

"I will have compassion
on whom I will have compassion.

Don't be so prideful. That's a sin.
"And the fearful and unbelieving.

"And the abominable,
the murderers, the warmongers,
<i>Jack, listen to me.</i>

"The sorcerers and the idolaters
and all liars...

Jesus came to save us,
not to damn us.
<i>"Shall have their part...</i>

in the lake which burneth
with fire and brimstone."

Revelation 21:8.
<i>Jesus, loves you.</i>

But He also knows how to punish
arrogant sinners like you.

"As many as I love,
I rebuke and chaste."
Revelation 3:19.

Jesus betrayed me.
<i>Stop this shit, or you're</i>
<i>going straight to hell!</i>

Hell?

This is hell.
Right here!

<i>You're damning your soul!</i>
<i>You shut up now...</i>

<i>and ask Christ</i>
<i>to forgive you!</i>
Hey! Forgive me?

I did everything
He asked me to do!
I changed!

<i>I gave Him my life,</i>
<i>and He betrayed me.</i>

He put that fucking truck in my hand
so I could carry out His will.

Made me kill that man
and those girls.

But hey, He didn't
give me the strength
to stay and save them.

Don't blaspheme, you bastard!
Christ had nothing to do with this!

God even knows
when a single hair
moves on your head.

And you taught me that.

<i>We're gonna pray</i>
<i>for you, Jack.</i>

Sure.

I can get you a cab.

I don't need a fuckin' taxi.
Just give me the glass, ma'am.

Here's your fuckin' glass.

I can drive her home.

Is this any of your business?
I'm your friend Paul

Yeah, well...
Remember?

Yeah. Well, can you
tell these assholes
to get away from me?

I'll drive her home.
It's not a big deal, okay?

Okay. All right?
You can't drive like this.

What do you care?

You're gonna get arrested.
Let me drive you.

Please?

Damn it.
