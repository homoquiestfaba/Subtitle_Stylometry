Brian and Tonya Digs.

Okay, it says here
you both feel

that your lives are
monotonous, unfulfilled,

sometimes humiliating
and straight out boring.

Guys,

these problems started
long before your marriage.

You've been like this
your whole lives.

So now you've sought
out my expertise

because you want to
make some changes, yes?

I n your marriage and
your lives, yes? Alright.

Question number
one here.

Do you love
each other?

Yes. When was the last time
you had any... fun... together?

When was the last time the
two of you did "that thing?"

"That thing?"

Fucked.

Yeah, that's
what I thought.

That's a damn shame.
Okay. Listen, uhm,

I'm gonna give you guys
a homework assignment.

Between now and
our next session,

I want you two to have
found something... fun.

To do.
Together.

Alrighty, then.

Yeah.

What do you call
a dog with no legs?

It doesn't matter
what you call him.

He's not comin'!

Here's another one.

What did one casket
say to the other casket?

Is that you "coffin?"

Digs, why haven't you authorized
payment on the Pettigrew account?

But... but M r. Haney, y...
you told me not to authorize it.

I never said that.

Yes you did, M r. Haney.
J... J ust yesterday.

Are you calling
me a liar, Digs?

Oh, n... n... no, sir,
M r. Haney...

Digs, if there's
one thing I hate,

it's an employee
who passes the buck.

You are skating on what I
like to call very thin ice.

Look at it!

If you happen to fall
through that very thin ice,

you are gonna
drown, comprende?

Yes, sir,
M r. Haney!

So, with that
having been said,

wipe that stupid look
off your face. Wipe it!

Get out of my office
and get back to work!

O K, I'm so sorry
we're late, M rs. Digs.

I got held up
at the shop-in

and my boyfriend Tyrone
had to bring me.

Hey, baby! You ready to go? Oome on.

Alright, well, say
goodnight to M rs. Digs.

<i>Alrlght. Here we go. Oh, sorry.</i>

<i>He better not get
no dlrt In my car.</i>

He ain't, Tyrone.
Damn.

<i>Alrlght. Say
goodnlght. Bye.</i>

H mm.

U h, honey?

I was thinking, uhm, maybe we
could catch a movie or something.

Oh! What's playing?

I don't know.

U hm, oh, I did hear
about that one starnet guy

w... with that other guy

and they, uh, they...
they go to that place,

and they, uh... and they
do that... that... thing.

Ha.

Maybe we should take a
romantic walk along the lake.

Although it does get
kind of dangerous

down there
around this time.

I saw on the news, some lady got
jumped in by a gang down there.

H m.

Maybe we should just stay home.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Boy, you fall for that one every time.

Evening, Brian.

Hello, Otis.
Hello, Amber.

Oome on in.

M m.

So I told the
motherfucker several times,

I said, "Motherfucker, keep your
dog from shittin' in my yard. "

That's what
you tell him.

But he wouldn't listen.
Would he, babe?

U h-uh. So I taught him a lesson.

I went out to his yard,
pulled my pants down,

took a shit
in his yard!

Took a shit
in his yard!

Anyway, Brian,
me and you...

Need to talk
man-to-man shit.

Now, Brian.

Oh, uh, yeah.
Excuse us, ladies.

Otis loves having
Brian as a neighbor.

I think he sees him as
the brother he never had.

Yeah. I see what you mean.

Tonya, remember I told you
I was gonna see that psychic

about those crazy
dreams I was having?

Well, she told me
that those dreams

were a manifestation of my
own latent psychic abilities.

She said I have
the gift, Tonya.

No!

M m-hm.

Let me read
your palm.

You know I wouldn't even ask you this

unless I really
needed it, Brian.

Oan you lend a brother a few dollars?

O... Otis, uh, you're my
neighbor and I like you.

A lot. But you never
paid me that 200

that I loaned you
two weeks ago

or that 300
from last month.

I ain't dissin',
bitch! See?

I come over here
in a time of need,

and you go come bringin'
up some ol' shit? H uh?

After all I do
around here,

come around here
socializing and shit?

Oomin' over here spreadin' my
knowledge, logic, and worldly wisdom

on your square ass? And
you wanna do this to me?

You know what?
Fuck you, Brian!

Fuck you with a big square dick!

Alright, alright. U hm, here's
at least 40 bucks. All I have.

Forty bucks?

Let me
have that.

What?
That's 42.

Now, see, that's what being
a good neighbor all about.

Being a neighbor is good food and money.

And you know what?
I'm gonna get this

back to you by the end of the week.

You understand me?
We a team!

You down
with Otis.

You down
with Otis?

Say " I'm down
with Otis. "

I'm... I'm... I'm
down with Otis.

Say it like you
mean it.

I'm down
with Otis.

You alright.
You alright.

You want
some chicken?

Oh.
Tonya! Sweety!

According to your palm,
you haven't been

a happy woman
for a very long time.

Oh, and day after day after day,

you have to put on the happy
facade for the little kiddies.

And all the time,
you're in need

of a little
stimulation yourself.

Oh. So how's the therapy
going for you and Brian?

How'd you know we were
seeing a therapist?

It's all here,
plain as day.

Oh. Oh.

Don't you
worry, Tonya.

You and Brian
are gonna find

that "something"
you both enjoy.

I'm telling you,
Brian, she saw things

that no one
could have known.

I believe in that
palm-reading stuff

as much as I believe
in Santa Olaus.

Well, you believed
in Santa Olaus

up until your junior
year in high school.

The point is, I don't
believe in it now, okay?

All that psychic doodle crap is a scam.

Now, I like Amber.

But she's a little
on the eccentric side.

H m. What
about Otis?

Good night, honey.

Good night.

<i>Come on, man,
hlt that dlce.</i>

Yo, fellas,

check out
LeMarc coming.

Boo!

' N ight, M r. Haney.

Digs, you finish
that Whitemore account?

You said you wanted it
on Thursday, M r. Haney.

I changed my mind,
I want it tomorrow.

M r. Haney, I was
just headed home.

I already put in
three extra hours.

You ever been down
to Skid Row, Digs?

I've driven past
it a few times.

It's a damn shame the way
those people live down there.

Amongst all the filth,
and scum, and shit!

A lot of those poor
bastards once had a good job.

J ust like you.

But they kept pissin'
off their bosses,

<i>just llke you.</i>

And if you're not
very careful, Digs,

you're gonna find yourself setting
up a cardboard box down there,

<i>just llke them.</i>

Y'understand?

Thank you.

Thank you!

<i>Thank you I I</i>

Aw, it's just
a bumper.

You did me a favor, I needed to wake up.

Why the fuck did you
stop like a fucking pussy?

Excuse me?

You heard
me, bitch.

Let's forget
the whole thing.

Where you
goin', huh?

I don't want trouble,
it's been a long day...

I don't wanna hear
your fucking life story.

I don't want trouble,
I'm trying to get home.

Yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?

Please, don't
do that.

Why, bitch? What are you gonna do?

Oh, you got
a fucking problem?

I told you I didn't
want any trouble.

I tell you I was
trying to get home.

Honey?

M m.
Yeah?

I, uh,

I had a little
accident tonight.

You did?
What happened?

Well, I was driving along
and I came to a stop sign

and this guy, he, uh,
he bumped from behind.

Are you and
the car O K?

Everything's fine.

Oh. O K.

Kinda.

Kinda? What do
you mean "kinda?"

Well, I "kinda" got into
a little altercation.

Altercation, Brian,
did you have a fight?

If you want
to call it that.

I killed him.

What do you
mean "killed him?"

I mean like he's dead. And I did it.

I just... I just sort
of snapped, honey,

I... I choked him
to death!

Brian, what are
we gonna do?

Well, I left as soon
as it happened

and I don't think anybody
saw me or anything.

Do you think we should call the Police?

Honey, if we
call the Police,

I'm going to
jail for... ever!

Maybe if we just
don't talk about it,

<i>It'll all
blow over.</i>

<i>Oh, don't cry, honey.
D... D... Don't cry.</i>

Everything's gonna
be fine, O K?

As a matter of fact,
just go back to sleep

and act like I never
told you. O K?

O K.

I'll try.

Yo, fellas. Here come LeMarc again.

Boldness is back.

Little big-ass
mustache.

Look here, man.

If you walkin' through here, you
gonna have to pay a toll or something.

We gotta leave
this guy alone, dog.

Hey man, you can walk right on
through. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Excuse us, man.

You been to karate
school or something?

God bless
you, brother.

I'm telling
you, honey,

as crazy as it sounds,
I feel like a new man.

For the first time in
my life, I feel strong.

Ever since
I killed that guy.

But Brian!

It's the truth!

I feel like I've experienced
some type of transformation.

It's... it's liberating.

It's crazy.

I agree. But maybe crazy isn't
as bad as we always thought.

Brian, you just can't
go around killing people.

Why not?

Because it's wrong!

Says who?

If I kill a burglar or an enemy
of the country, is that wrong?

Honey, maybe it's time
we start questioning

everything we've
been taught.

I feel like I've been
brainwashed my whole life!

Always told to do the
so-called "right thing. "

Walk in a single file
line. Do your homework.

Eat your vegetables.
Get a degree.

Get a job.
Follow the rules.

Don't cause problems.
Don't be an inconvenience.

I'm tellin' you, honey, I'm
not the man I used to be.

Boy, you want to buy a
second one in the jaw.

Whatch'all got to eat?

Dog.

Oh, yeah.

I don't like
the sonuvabitch nohow.

I should've bust the crack in
his ass on general principle.

<i>You see, I'm the type of person</i>

that I tell somebody what
I think to their face.

<i>Do y'understand?</i>

M m. Honey,

you make this macaroni
and cheese yourself?

Why... why,
yes I did, Otis.

<i>M m.</i>

It tastes
like shit.

Too bland. Needs some sugar in it.

I tell Amber
all the time,

"When you make
macaroni and cheese,

<i>put a llttle sugar
In It. " Thls here,</i>

this ain't really
macaroni and cheese.

This shit cheese.
Oh, yeah.

<i>Blg ol' plle
of shlt.</i>

O K. Well, uhm, I better
get to those dishes.

Excuse me.

<i>H m.</i>

Not bad, Brian.

Not bad at all.

But I can tell by the way she walks,

you ain't hittin'
that right.

You ain't hittin'
that right.

By the way,

I ain't giving you back
that money no time soon.

Mess around,
got a boot on my car.

And I know I just let the
fucker just sit out there,

but it gonna work out, dog. So...

I'm ready to hold a few more
dollars, man. To get that boot off.

Do me
a favor, Otis.

Wait right here.

Otis.

You've had this coming for a long time.

You must not know
who you fuckin' with!

Thanks, honey.

I didn't hurt
him, did I?

You didn't
hurt him.

You killed him.

I killed him? W... W... What
do you mean I killed him?

<i>I mean,
I'm golng to jall?</i>

<i>Oh my God I
I'm golng to jall I</i>

Honey, we have
to keep our heads!

Yeah, you killed him but you
saved my life in the process.

I'm proud of you. Now we just have to...

get rid of
the body.

How?

I think you better wait outside, honey.

M ission accomplished.

I don't think killing
somebody is an accomplishment

we should be
proud of, Brian.

Especially friends
of ours.

Honey, Otis was never a friend.

You hated him as much as I did.

What about Amber?

Honey, we did
Amber a favor!

Do you imagine what
it must have been like

to live
with that prick?

I have to admit,

as shameful
as it sounds,

I found the
whole thing...

exhilarating.

Exhilarating is
good. I mean...

shouldn't we do things
we find exhilarating?

J ust like the
therapist said,

do things that we find fun. Together.

Brian, we just can't go
around killing innocent people.

Tell you what.

We'll only kill people who deserve it.

People like...
like Otis.

This is crazy.

I can't believe we're
talking about this.

I mean, I've never felt
like this before, so...

alive! And I
have to admit...

What, honey?

I can't help but notice a change in you.

A new-found poise,

confidence,

Oh... oh yeah?

Absolutely.

So... dominant.

So... alpha male!

I think...
I think it's sexy.

Sexy?
Yeah?

Yeah, I do.

<i>Take mel
You flnel</i>

<i>Oh I</i>

O K! Oh, yeah! I got it!

<i>O K, baby I
O KI</i>

<i>O KI O KI</i>

I don't care how overwhelmed
you think you are.

If I don't hear from you
by the end of this evening,

you'll be overwhelmed
with unemployment!

What the hell are you
doing in my office?

Well, M r. Haney,

I figured it was time
we had a little talk.

And since I'm always
here so late anyway,

why not tonight?

Have you lost
your mind?

Maybe.

I wanted to talk to you
about your people skills.

They're terrible.

You see,
M r. Haney,

when you're in
a position of power,

you're responsible for
treating those under you

with, at the very least...
a little common decency.

<i>I've trled to be a good employee to you,</i>

but you wouldn't
let me.

<i>Not only dld you move up deadllnes,</i>

but you've sabotaged every
account I've worked on.

More than that,
you've denied me

the common respect and decency
that everybody deserves.

First off,
you're fired.

<i>Not only are you flred,
you are very fucklng flred.</i>

I'll see to it that you
never work in this town again.

You won't even get
a job collecting cans.

Second, before you plunge
face-first into the cold cold world

of unemployment, destitution
and eventual suicide,

let me explain a little
something to you, pal!

Shit rolls downhill.

I'm at the top of that hill,
and you're at the bottom.

So when I shit, it rolls down the hill

and you eat it!

That's the way of the world.
Always was, always will be.

Now, you got about five minutes
to evacuate this building

before I
call security.

Not much
time left, Digs.

What do you
think you're doing?

This isn't
fucking funny.

How's it going?

J ust one
minute, nigger.

U h, I need to see
what's in that bag.

Excuse me?

I said, I need to see
what's in that bag, Negro.

I had a real heavy
workload today.

U h-huh.

So I just decided to
take all my files home

and sort
of finish up.

U hm, lemme ask
you a question.

Do I look like
a rookie to you?

My job is to maintain
security around here.

All this. This is me,
bro. All of that. O K?

How do I know that you're not stealing

secret documents
in that bag?

Which is a big-ass
bag by the way?

So, I'm gonna ask you one
more time, African-American.

I need to see
what's in that bag.

Damn!

Hello?

Woman, what did I tell you
about calling me at my job?

My job is to be
a security guard,

I can't secure a shit if
I'm on the phone with you!

And what the hell you up so late anyway?

Eatin' crawfish? At
three in the morning?

Woman, I swear to God when I
see you, I'm gonna kick your...

You know, you were right, M r. Haney.

It's a damn shame the way
these people live down here.

Here you
go, brothers.

Hot damn!
Thank you, baby.

And then the pig looks
at the butcher and says,

"Damn! I must have filled
out the wrong application!"

Oh Brian, you should
be a stand-up comic.

You're so funny.

Me?
Nah.

I better keep
my day job.

Speaking of
jobs, honey,

with Haney gone, maybe
I'll get a promotion.

Oh.

Baby.

I'm sure Otis will turn up soon.

Maybe he just needed
to get away for a while.

No! No! Otis has
never not come home.

Never! Never! Never!

And I called the Police. And they said

that I can't report
him missing

because he hasn't been gone long enough!

I just know something
terrible has happened to him!

My Otis!

U hm, uh, I'm sure it's not
nearly as bad as you think.

Right, Brian?
Baby.

Yeah. I'm sure
Otis is fine.

No he's not!

No!

Amber,

there's something I
think I need to tell you.

Otis made me promise not to tell.

Oh.

What? What
did Otis say?

This is really
hard for me.

I mean, you know how close
Otis and I, we're like brothers.

Yeah, I know.

I really feel like a
heel betraying a trust.

Spit it out, Brian.
Amber deserves to know.

I know, it's just so hard.

Amber,

Otis was
having an affair.

An affair?

My Otis?

I was just as surprised as you are.

He said he'd been corresponding
back and forth off and on

with his mistress
for over a year.

He met her online
in some chatroom.

A mistress?
Online chatroom?

I ain't never seen Otis on no computer.

And I never read anything
like this in his palm!

<i>I mean,
who Is she?</i>

Some young girl,
like 19 or 20.

What?

He said he was planning
on leaving you... for her.

Oh. Oh no.
No. No.

No, not my Otis.
No, he wouldn't... no.

I tried to talk him out
of it, Amber, really I did.

When last we spoke, I thought
he put the whole crazy idea

out of his head.
I guess I was wrong.

Oh no!

I'm sorry, Amber.

Amber, honey, it's not your fault.

Maybe you're better off without him.

Listen to me.

If Otis doesn't
want you,

then you don't
want him.

Yeah, Amber! You're
still an attractive woman.

I'm sure there
are hundreds.

Dora Lee's a couple guide.
She'll be thrilled to have you.

Yeah, Amber, it's time
you move on with your life.

Right?
Right.

You think so?

Absolutely! Lt'd be
like a brand new start.

A new lease on life. These
are exciting times for you.

I like that.

Yeah?

Yeah.

<i>Yeah.</i>

You know what?
You're both right.

Otis made his bed. Now he can lay in it.

Yeah, that
crusty... old... ass!

Ass, y'all! Yeah! He can
just stay where he is.

And that young heffer, I hope
she gives him a heart attack.

Otis did me a favor.
That's right, you guys.

It is time for me,
Amber, to have some fun!

You... it...

It's like my
momma said.

One monkey... don't stop no show.

Especially no
monkey named Otis!

Well, I just want
to thank you both

for being
so supportive.

Oh, thank
you, Brian.

You just need to go
home, forget about Otis,

and focus
on Amber.

We love
you, Amber.

And if you need anything at all,

don't hesitate
to call.

Oh, God bless
you both.

Like we said, Amber,
don't be a stranger.

Don't worry, Alfonso.
Your mom will be here soon.

I'm solo on
a date, baby.

M ichelle at the shop
working on some nappy-head.

Get your little
ass in the car.

Oan't stand the
little motherfucker.

So you his teacher?
You got a first name?

M rs. Digs.

Take it easy, baby.

Look at your
sexy little ass.

J ust trying to make
a little conversation.

I saw the way you
was looking at me.

Say something to your momma about this,

I'm gonna beat you worse than
I did the last time. Hear me?

Hey, hey! My name is Tonya.

You know I ain't really
feeling M ichele no more.

H mm.

U h-uh.

It's fucked up but I gotta
stay with her for a while

'cause I'm trying
to stack my chips,

get my dough right so I
can get back in the studio.

The studio? So, uh, you sing?

Baby, I rhyme.

Oh.

You wanna hear
a little something?

Oheck it out.

One, two.
One, two.

* Today is the day
I get to wax that ass *

* Little school teacher Gonna
get me a pass To her class *

* So I can wax it And smack
it, Flip it and fax it *

* You know the rule,
Welcome to my school * *

You like that,
don't you?

Ooh, yeah. You're very talented, Tyrone.

I know that.

So, uh,

what time you say your
husband was coming home?

Really late.

Yeah.

So, uhm, Tyrone,

what is your relationship
like with Alfonso?

He's such
a little sweetheart.

I can't stand
the little bastard.

See, y'all think 'cause
he quiet, he's good,

but I can't stand
little quiet motherfuckers.

That's why I have to watch him.

And I see him,
lookin' at me,

cuttin' me little
dirty-ass looks,

that's why every now
and then I gotta pop him

upside his little
nappy-ass head.

H mm.

Keep him in line
and shit.

But fuck all,

You know I came
here to fuck.

Really?

Yeah.

This what
you want?

You know that's
what I want.

Right now?

Right now.

O K, let's go
to the bedroom.

Let's go.

Oh!

Oome on, girl!

Oh, O K,
hold it, Tyrone.

Something I need
to tell you.

What?

I'm a freak.

Shit.
So am I.

Oh! No, no!
O K. No, no, no.

I mean, for real.
I'm a real freak.

I'm strictly...
into freaky things.

Like what?

Handcuffs.

Handcuffs?! You out
of your goddamn mind!

I ain't about to let you handcuff me!

Then it's time
for you to go

'cause I only deal with
men who are on my level.

Oh, fuck that. I ain't no punk now!

Go and get
them cuffs.

You're into this
kind of shit?

Relax, Tyrone. You just
have to keep an open mind.

What are you
gonna do with that?

Oomfy?

M mm.

M m.

That's what
I'm talking about!

I better get
some protection.

Protection?
Where you goin'?

You got me
all worked up!

We don't need no protection!
Oome on, we both clean! Oome on!

Hey.

This ain't what
it look like.

But you got to know,
your bitch chose me. O K?

Now,

you look like
a gentleman,

we can handle this
like two gentlemen.

Or you can
uncuff me,

and we can get into some gangster shit.

What you laughin' at,
nigger? This ain't funny.

Now you uncuff me and she
gonna be downright hilarious

because of the shit
I'm gonna do.

Where the fuck Tonya at? Tonya! Tonya!

Aw.

M mmm.

What are you
gonna do with that?

He was good
for me.

Well, from
the looks of it,

you two won't be requiring
my services any longer.

<i>What's the secret?</i>

Well, basically,

we just found something fun to do.

Together.

Ah.

<i>Well, congratulatlons.</i>

<i>Honey, I have
to confess.</i>

I've never been so
happy in my whole life.

I feel the
same way.

O K, Brian,
I was thinking,

we never really
had a honeymoon,

and neither of us have
been to the islands, so,

maybe we
should go.

<i>So then thls Splc
smashes Into me, rlght?</i>

So I get out of the car
to check the damage,

but really, it's to make
sure this little wetback prick

doesn't try to run. None
of these Spics ever have

legal registration
or any insurance.

<i>Then thls blg nlgger
stops hls car and gets out,</i>

as if it's any of
his freakin' business.

At this point, I'm looking
around, I'm wondering,

Am I the only fuckin'
American here? Fuck.

Excuse me, sir.

My wife and I are
trying to enjoy our meal.

Would you mind lowering
your voice just a little?

Anyway, this big nigger
walks up like he's a cop,

but, check this out, he completely
ignores me, the white guy,

and starts talkin'
to the Spic!

Oan you believe
that shit? Fuck!

So, the Islands?

Where'd I park
that piece of shit?

Agh. Agh! You
son of a bitch!

What do
you think?

Again.

Wooo!

One more
for the road.

Whoo!

Wait, wait!
Wait, brother!

I didn't even see you
hit that white dude.

I was just smoking my joint.
It's not worth killing me.

I'm just a waiter. How
much is it worth killing me?

Oome on, this is black
on black crime, brother.

The worse thing I do is
smoke weed. The last I smoke.

I just went back
to school.

I dropped out of J unior
H igh a long time ago.

I'm back in
the 9th grade.

I'm trying to make
shit happen.

I'm just trying to
take care of my kids.

I got four of them,
five maybe.

I'm in the church,
and I'm in the mosque.

Allah is good,
but so is Jesus.

I'm gonna pick
that joint up,

you and I gonna go
sit down, smoke it

and you tell me
how I could come up,

get suits like that,
Range Rover like that.

And we could
be friends.

We better go, baby.

What's wrong?

I was just
thinkin', honey.

We said we'd only kill
people that deserved it.

That guy in the parking
lot, he didn't deserve it.

He was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

Baby, we did what we had to do.

That guy saw our car, he saw our faces,

what were we supposed to
do? Let him turn us in?

We're just now starting
to enjoy our lives.

And I'll be damned if I let
anyone or anything spoil that.

O K?

Now we came here
to have fun.

Okey-dokey?

So let's go
and dance.

Excuse me for
a second, baby.

Ha.
Wow.

What can I get for you tonight, brother?

I think we'll try
something different.

I think we'll have
two glasses of red rum.

Good choice.

But for real.
If that guy showed

Don't you hate it when
guys try to make muscles

where they
ain't got none?

Oh, for real,
for real.

Girl, do you see
what I see?

Looks like some bitches just don't
know how to hold their liquor.

Here you guys go.

Thank you.

Ah, just in time.

Oh!

To us.

Ahh.

Whoo!

Yeah!

<i>* I'm the man *</i>

<i>* I'm the man *</i>

<i>* I'm the man * *</i>

Oh, baby...

Honey, honey,
please, not now.

Don't I look
sexy enough?

Honey, you look
very sexy, honey.

I just need a moment
to pull myself together.

Okay.

What's wrong, baby?

I stopped by the garage
to get the oil checked.

Okay.

And that's when
I saw him.

He didn't see me
but I saw him.

He had on a mechanics
uniform. He must work there.

I hadn't seen him
in 15 years but

I recognized him the moment I saw him.

Who, baby?

Butch Bailey.

Who is this Butch Bailey and
what did he do to you, baby?

Butch Bailey was the kid
who terrorized me every day

of my entire
high school career.

For Butch, my torment,
was his entertainment!

Taking my hard-earned lunch money
wasn't enough for this guy, oh no.

Our daily routine consisted of
nuggies, frogs, wedgies, the works.

He used to call me Oharlie Brown
because of the shape of my head.

J ust when I started
feeling cool.

Butch Bailey pulled the
nerve right back out of me.

Honey, I think it's time we settled
the score with this Butch Bailey.

H uh?

I think it would
be therapeutic.

It would be like exorcising
a demon from your past.

Now you know where Butch Bailey works.

J ust go down there and pay him a visit.

And

Whoo!

Go get
him, baby.

It's been a long time, Butch.

Hey Butch! Say hello
to my little friend.

<i>Dudel Rlght now, what
you're dolng Is wrong I</i>

<i>Yes, you I The Lord told me to tell you</i>

<i>that what you're dolng Is
wrong as the day Is long.</i>

<i>What? You thlnk the Lord aln't
hlp to your dastardly deeds?</i>

<i>You thlnk the Lord aln't peeklng on you?</i>

<i>U h-huh I</i>

<i>But It's not too late
to save your twlsted soul</i>

<i>from eternal damnatlon.</i>

<i>The questlon Is, are you ready
to answer the Lord's call?</i>

<i>Are you ready to answer
the Lord's call? I</i>

Where's your garage?

It's about
two blocks over.

Okay, let's go
get him, baby.

Honey, I've been
doing some thinking.

This thing between Butch
and I is kinda personal.

Maybe this is one
I should do alone.

Baby! I want in
on the action.

I know you
do, honey,

but this is one

I need to do
on my own.

Alright, baby.

M m, mm, mm.

Go and get him.

I'm looking
for Butch Bailey.

<i>Hold on.</i>

What you want, man?

You don't
remember me?

Hell, no.

We both went to
Mount Vernon H igh.

You used to pick
on me every day.

Oharlie Brown? Aw, hell
now, after all these years.

My man, Oharlie Brown,
come here, old boy.

Look at you,
looking all smooth.

Yo, where is it? Where the lunch
money? Where the lunch money?

Man, I used to whoop
your ass back in the day.

So what you doin'
in my shop?

Need your
car fixed?

Hell, I took your money back in the day,

I might as well take
it now too, huh?

Remember that time when I
made you eat all that dirt

right in front
of the Ohilean team?

Now that shit was
funny as hell.

Oharlie Brown. My man, Oharlie Brown.

<i>What you're dolng Is wrong
as the day Is long.</i>

<i>You thlnk the Lord aln't peeklng on you?</i>

<i>U h-huh I</i>

<i>But It's not too late
to save your twlsted soul</i>

<i>from eternal damnatlon.</i>

Man, you remember
that time I...

Did you get
him, baby?

What did you do
with the body?

What happened, baby?

Brian?

Honey, we've had
a lot of fun.

Our lives have undergone
a transformation

that very few
ever experience.

We found that thing that brought
that spark into our lives.

But now it's time to stop.

What are you
talking about, Brian?

I'm talking about the killing, Tonya.

It has to stop.

Why?

Honey, what we've been doing
is as wrong as the day is long.

You think the Lord
hasn't been peeping us?

You think he's not hip
to our dastardly deeds?

Oh no, honey. He's seen it
all and he don't like it.

But it's not
too late.

The question is...

are we ready... to
answer the Lord's call?

Whatever happened
to questioning

everything we've been
taught all of our lives?

Whatever happened to
being tired of doing

the so-called
"right thing?"

I thought we decided
to have some fun.

And live by our own set of rules.

Things have changed.
I've changed.

Now, I know this is a lot to ask.

But I need you
to change too.

I n the name
of our love,

I need you to stop the killing.

Alright, baby.

If it means that
much to you,

we can stop.

Thank you, Tonya.

Oh.

Thank you!

I n the name of God,
Satan, I rebuke you!

Okay!
Okay!

H mm.

Thank God we're no longer
a part of that foolishness.

Yeah.
Thank God.

Whoo!

Ma'am, although you
haven't said a word yet,

I can tell you're a woman who
likes to get the job done right.

Aren't you tired of slaving over
your meals with dull utensils?

Don't you wish you could chop up
food like those Japanese chefs?

Well, now you can.

Ma'am, do you mind if I step in
and give you a free demonstration?

Please do.

Honey!

I'm home early.

Guess who got
promoted today?

Time to celebrate.

Tonya?

Tonya?

Honey?

Honey?

Brian, honey,
you're home early!

Are you mad?

<i>Am I mad?
Am I mad?</i>

Yeah.

I come home early
to celebrate

a promotion
with my wife

and find her cutting up
some strange man in our tub!

Oh, congratulations
on the promotion, baby!

Don't congratulate
me now.

You strangled all the joy
out of that accomplishment.

You lied to me, Tonya.
You betrayed our trust.

Wait a minute, Brian. We had
a good thing going on here

before you caught the holy
ghost and flipped the script.

Yeah, maybe
I was wrong

to tell you what you wanted to hear?

Was it right to impose
your holy world ways on me?

U nlike some people,
I like to keep it real.

It's not my fault that you are too pussy

to have
any real fun.

What did you
just call me?

A pussy!

Oan you
hear yourself?

Oan you hear
yourself, honey?

Since when do you talk to me like that?

I can't believe
what you've become.

Whatever I've become,
you made me.

Don't you try to turn this around on me!

I'm trying to save your
soul from the fires of hell!

You're going...

Good evening, M r. Digs.
I'm Detective Gonzalez.

I was wondering
if I could, uh,

ask you and your wife
a few questions.

<i>I'm sure you're
both aware</i>

of the recent serial murders
we've been experiencing.

Yeah, yeah. We... we heard about it.

Yeah. Well, before all the
bodies started popping up,

I was assigned to a few
missing persons cases

and as, uh, coincidental
as this may sound,

the both of you are linked to
some of those persons in question.

We are?

Yeah.

How is
that possible?

Well, there's
Dudley Haney.

That's your
employer, M r. Digs.

And Tyrone Davis is a
live-in mama's boyfriend

of one of
M rs. Digs' students.

And Otis H ughes, that's
your next door neighbor.

Now he just stopped
showing up at his job.

H is wife placed a missing persons call,

but we haven't been
able to reach her since.

Ohh.

Wow, that, uh,
that is a coincidence.

<i>Detectlve Gonzalez, we
appreclate your stopplng by</i>

and we're really concerned
about those missing people

but I'm afraid we won't
be of much help to you.

H mm.
Well,

wouldn't it be
something, though,

if the perpetrators
of those missing guys

were somehow connected to
the recent serial killings?

Ha, ha.

Yeah.

That would
be something.

Well, I've taken up enough of
your time this fine evening.

Listen, if either of you
happen to recollect anything

that might be
of some assistance,

please give me
a call.

You bet.

And, uh,
before I go,

do you mind if I use your bathroom?

U h...

Of course you can use our bathroom.

It's just right down the hall.

U hm, great. Thank you very much.

<i>Rlght over here?</i>

Yeah, just down
that hall.

I hope they have
some air freshener

'cause I'm about
to blow the sucker up.

I'm getting pretty good
with this motherfucker.

Oome on, baby.

We gotta cut up
the detective

so we can toss him out
with the salesman.

We? My, aren't
we plural today?

"We" aren't
doing anything.

Because "we" didn't kill anybody today.

You're on your own
with this one, honey.

Fine. You think I need your
help to get rid of these two?

I've taken out more people
than you could ever count.

I didn't need you then
and I don't need you now.

Wait a second.

Baby.

If you think I'm trusting
you with this, you're crazy.

Tonya?

We need to talk.

I've been doing
some thinking.

Something you said earlier
was absolutely right.

This is all
my fault.

I'm the one who brought you into this.

And I'm sorry.

But just like I started
it, I have to finish it.

I asked you nicely
before to stop.

Now I really
mean it, honey.

I need you to stop
the killing right now.

Or,

you'll force me to do
what I have to do.

Fine by
me, Brian.

If you feel you have to
do what you have to do,

then I guess I have to do
what I have to do too.

Fine.

Fine.

Lord,

I'm at a major
crossroads here.

J ust like Abraham,

I've been called to do
something that I really,

really, really, do not want to do.

I ask that you give
me the strength,

to stop the evil
that I have created.

I'm sorry, Lord.
I just couldn't...

I'm sorry, baby.

Why won't
you die?

Whoo-whooo!

Forgive me, honey,
but I have to do this

once and for all.

Whoa!

What you got?

What you got, Brian?
What you got?

That's how you want it,
honey? Let's see what you got.

Yeah.

You're so suspect.

You little pussy.

Aha!

Well, honey, I guess
this is where it all ends.

<i>Klnda poetlc
justlce, huh?</i>

But in all honesty, I'll meet
my end with only one regret.

And that one regret
is that I led you

down the path of
psychopathic madness.

Honey, I hope that my
death will open your eyes

to what you... to
what we became.

And if my death will help
you find your own salvation,

then I gladly
give my life.

Because...

I love you, Tonya.

Well, with all that
having been said,

shoot!

Oh, Brian.

Oh, honey.

I'm sorry, baby.

<i>That's alrlght.</i>

We gotta step
it up, honey.

Our flight leaves
in two hours.

This is so
exciting, Brian.

I always wanted
to go to the Islands.

I'd never dream that we would
actually be living there.

No one will ever find us there, honey.

Once we get there
and get settled in,

and take on those
new identities,

we can put all this stuff behind us.

Oh!

Baby, it's like we're starting all over.

A never-ending
honeymoon. Give it to me.

My God!

Okay.

Okay!

Oh.

Oh.

Okay.
