(Eerie high-pitched whirring)

Leave him alone!

Er macht viel zu viele Witze!

Come on, Liz. We must get out of here.
But Graz will kill us.

Halt.

She's been hit. He's shot her. Killed her.

(Eerie high-pitched whirring)

Schweinhund.

How badly is she hurt?
She's dead.

Get her on the sofa. The sofa at once.
Come on, Simon, help me. That's it.

Slowly. Good.

We'll have to get a doctor
if there's a bullet in her.

Let's see how bad it is.
lf she dies...

She won't.

That's strange.
What is?

There's blood, but no mark.
What?

l don't understand this.

There's nothing.
The skin hasn't been broken.

Yes. Yes, Mr Traynor, she's over here.

Jean? Jean?

She's out. Out like a light.

l wonder why she came here.

She must have seen something
that drew her here.

lt looks as if her gift
is coming into its own.

She's coming round.
Let's get her back to the hotel.

Liz. Liz.

Frank! Frank, Liz is dead.

Honest, it can't hurt.
The bullet didn't even touch you.

lt's like a knife, a red-hot knife.

But it can't be.
You haven't even been hit.

lt's queer. Your thug could hardly have
missed her at point-blank range.

Was passierte hier?

Sie wurde erschossen
wahrend sie fluchtete.

Very well. Sit her up, Simon.

But it hurts and she's crying.
Do as l tell you.

Ow!

Now, listen to me, young lady.
You've had a lucky escape.

l don't understand how. You're all right
and that will be the end of the matter.

You can stop crying.
l'm not all right. l've been shot.

No, Liz, there's no mark.
Then why does it hurt so much?

You are playing tricks again.
Look, it can't hurt.

Feel it and see.

Feel?
Yes.

Funny. l thought there'd be a hole.
There isn't.

No.

And will you kindly stop
wasting my time?

How's it wasting time?
There's a mystery.

The bullet didn't hit her -
where's the blood come from?

Hmm.

This door won't lock.
l'll have to put you in the back room

where you'll be free of the tender mercies
of Graz and out of my hair. Come on.

Come and sit down.

Jean, you must keep calm.

Calm? How can l be calm? Liz is dead.
No, Jean, no.

l tell you. l saw the German shoot her.

She was climbing through the window
and then he fired and she fell.

And all because that man wanted
some information and you trusted him.

Mrs Skinner, l'm asking you
to believe that your daughter is not hurt.

How can l believe that? She's dead.
No.

But l saw her fall, the bullet hit her.

ln a state of hallucination,
it is impossible for her to come to harm.

She's only there in a subjective sense.

But if something happened,
which she associated with harm,

like a gun going off in her direction,
she could imagine she'd been hurt.

lmagine it?

That gun was fired in 1940.
The bullet couldn't possibly have hit Liz.

But l saw the patch of blood.
lt spread and spread.

She couldn't imagine
something like that.

Well, l assure you it is possible,
but it is a difficult business,

so perhaps you'd better find out
the truth of the matter.

Me?
Yes, you.

Only you can help now. You know that.

Look, haven't we frittered away
too much time on this operation already?

You have a window on Liz's world
and you're aware of it.

You must take charge from now on.

l think you can if you choose.

See what you want to see
when you want to see it.

Frank, are you all right?

Yes, fine. Just that muzzy feeling
in my head again.

And you?
Oh, great.

There was nothing the matter with me.
l just thought l was hurt.

Thought it. Well, that makes us a couple
of odd bods, doesn't it? Proper cases.

Oh.

Frank, can't you remember anything
about what happened?

You lost your memory.
There's got to be a reason.

All that's going through my mind
is l had something to do.

No, not that. That was the machine thing.

You had to dismantle it.
But Simon says you did.

What made you lose your memory?
The accident or whatever?

l don't know. You're a funny kid.

We are prisoners of war,
nothing to each other,

and you worry about me. That's nice.

Hey. Don't get upset.

lf l could tell you what you wanted to
know, l would. But l'm blessed if l can.

lt's just a mystery
that will never be solved, isn't it?

Like you bleeding
when you weren't shot.

What?
That's a big mystery.

A bigger mystery
than what happened to me.

There are far too many
confounded mysteries around here.

lt's time we worked a few things out.
Shouldn't be too hard.

l'm too tired to start thinking.

You said we had to find out about
those papers in the Commander's office.

How can we do that without thinking?
What are you on about?

The first mystery is what happened
to Liz. Then what happened to you.

But l think l've got a clue.
You have?

You broke out bleeding
when you hadn't been hurt.

l read about something like that once.

This man in a war was very frightened.

He had a dream about being chased
by natives with knives.

When he woke up,
there was a gash on his leg.

You mean he thought there was a gash.
No, it was there.

Only in this case, it didn't bleed.

(Eerie whirring)

(Voices echo)

What l'm saying is
the opposite happened to Liz.

(Voices echo)

She thought she'd been hit by the bullet.

(Voices echo)

So even though
there wasn't any wound...

(Voices echo)

She's all right.
What happened?

Oh, Frank, Liz is all right.

She only imagined the bullet hit her.

l can hear what they're talking about.

Simon's saying...

Autosuggestion.
Auto?

All it means is you do it to yourself.

That's silly. How can you bleed
when there's no wound?

How did the man get a gash on his leg
when there was no knife?

l don't know. But if it is true,
l don't like it. lt sounds mad.

That's the word for it, girlie.

We were a couple of odd bods
and now we're a couple of nuts.

He isn't talking about you, Frank.

That's another mystery altogether.
What's the solution to that?

Oh, l'm not so sure there.
You're not?

Listen, remember when you dismantled
that machine after l found the cupboard?

You still felt dizzy.
l was only half there.

And yet you still seemed
to remember what to do.

That's peculiar. So l was wondering...

lf you tried to dismantle the machine
before, only something went wrong.

Perhaps something to do with the ray.

The ray's only a beam of light,
but very powerful.

lf it were turned on someone...

it might...might...
(Skinner) Yes?

Something's happened.

l can't seem to hear any more.

lt's all...

all...

lt's gone now. l've lost them.

Come and sit down.

lf the ray were turned on someone...

So you think that's
what happened to me.

The beam we had then was a candle
compared with what we have now.

But all the same,
if you did manage to get a touch of it...

Come on, Commander.
l've been waiting 30 years to hear this.

My dear chap, who can tell?

Brain damage perhaps.

Brain damage?
Memory cells destroyed.

Yes, that seems to make sense.

Your power of memory disappeared and
then came back gradually after the war.

Yes, well, the brain
is an adaptable organism.

When one part dies,
another part takes over.

Good grief.

Frank.

Please, my dear.

Just so long as we know at last.
Just so long as we know.

Everything's going to be
all right from now on.

l can feel it.


l was just closing down for the night,
Mr Traynor. Can l get you something?

No, l don't think so, thank you, Bradley.

Grand old jobs. A better means
of signalling hasn't yet been devised.

Didn't know you were in the navy.
l wasn't.

But you know how to use
a signalling lamp.

So let's see, then,
you spent your war...here.

ln St Oswald. Right?
l don't see that's any of your business.

Maybe not, but you know my passion
for mysteries, don't you, Bradley?

So you were a noncombatant,
so to speak?

By the way, l'll probably be vacating
my room some time tomorrow.

l see, sir.
My business here is almost completed.

Just a couple of loose ends to tie up.

Well, Commander,
are you going to speak at last?

Old boy, just tell me what to say.

You are conducting
experiments with light.

New experiments that you will
explain to me now,

unless you prefer l explain them to you.

You really think you've got that far?

l may still need to hear it
from your own lips,

but l wasn't joking when l told you
l had other proof.

Perhaps l could help you
with the experiment.

Help me?
Obviously it's in an imperfect state.

l've helped you in the past.

Can't you believe anything l tell you?

l'm not here for the Nazis
or the Third Reich, but for Germany.

Not for war, but for peace.
l can see that you believe it.

Because it's true.

You know, in a funny sort of way,
l'd almost like to help you, Gottfried.

Then you will. You must.

No. Because l think you're deluded.

The Hitlers of this world aren't
overthrown without a hell of a push.

That's the reason there's a war on.

Then you give me no choice,
but to resort to my final alternative.

What are you talking about?

Our arrangements for getting
out of England are particularly good.

We made them with special care

because we believed work of
unusual importance was going on here.

l shall have to leave in a short time now.

But l could always take you
with me to Germany.

We've got to do something.
Do what?

To find out whether the Germans
saw those papers, we've got to move.

What is all this about papers?

They're supposed to be in
Commander Traynor's office.

We have to find out
if the Germans saw them.

ln his office?
Yes.

That's queer.
What?


What are you doing?
Kicking up a racket.

lf we get a guard in here...

No.
Right, Frank?

l suppose so.
Things were getting dull in here.

You've both gone mad. Stop it. Stop.

(Eerie whirring)

Frank. Frank.
Can you see them again?

Yes.

Yes. They've started some trouble.


They're throwing things about.


Raus!

You've got to help Frank.
Against Graz?

lt's all talk with you.
We've got to do something.

Argh!

Simon, do something.

He's hurt. He's hurt again.

We must get to Commander Traynor.

But Frank...
No time.

Commander Traynor.

l wouldn't do that if l were you, Bradley.

Murder on top of treason. They'd bring
back hanging just to oblige you.

What's your complaint? You've had
25 good years. And l'm not a policeman.

There's nothing that could be
called evidence against you.

So run if you think that's a good idea.

Run for a long time.

Run forever.

Nobody cares, Bradley.

Frank!

Oh, Frank, please wake up.
You can't be hurt again.

Papers, papers...

What?
ln the office.

Now we must go.

You don't seriously intend taking me
to Germany with you, Gottfried.

You don't imagine l'd go?

We'll silence you. Don't worry about that.

You've left me no choice. Graz!

Graz!

lst Graz dort?
Nein, Herr Kapitan.

Hier.

Machen Sie sich so schnell als
moglich bereit. Warten Sie auf mich.

They'll signal us when
the transport arrives. We'll wait outside.

The Commander's got the gun,
so we'll be all right.

All we have to do now is find out
about those papers.

But we can't now.
Why?

Gottfried's gone and he's
the only one who could have told us.

Oh, Liz, l've been a fool. We've failed.

Papers...

So l've remembered what l had to do.

Frank, are you all right?

Yes. l'm fine.

Are those the papers
from the Commander's office?

Yes.

He just said destroy the machine,

but l knew the papers would be
in danger where he put them.

So when l had a moment,
l went back to the office, took the papers,

hung onto them, knowing l could put
them back when it was all over.

You, Skinner,
you had the papers all the time.

Me?
Gottfried couldn't have seen them.

He was bluffing when he said he had
proof of what we were working on.

That's that, then. My work can go on.
You did a marvellous job, Skinner.

Marvellous?

Marvellous for you maybe.

What about me and Jean and Liz?
What about us?

Ah, the signal.

Well, l'm sorry l can't release members
of your staff we imprisoned in the shed.

But l assure you they haven't been hurt.

You made...

Frank.
There's nothing more we can do now.

We must go.
But he's still ill.

You know what happens.

Commander Traynor finds him
and he goes to hospital.

And then one day he's my father.

Frank, l've got to go now.

Go?
Yes. But you'll be all right in the end.

Sure l will.

Just finding that bit of memory
coming back must have been a mistake.

Everything's getting blurred again.
Frank.

Oh, you fool, Traynor.

l came here only for peace,
but you wouldn't believe me.

So if it's war you want, you can have war.

Why don't you kill me?

We're at war. We must die
rather than learn how to live.

You see? You don't want war after all.

But you won't have peace,
so that's where it ends.

Until another day.

Gottfried.
A better day, Commander.

Too late, Traynor.

Come back!

Please come round again.
l won't see you like this ever again.

Liz, it's no use. Let's go.
l've got to say goodbye to him.

Frank, l'm going now. Really.

Going?

That's too bad.

Have a nice trip.

But, girlie, who are you?

(Liz sobs)

Come on, Liz. lt's all over now. Let's go.

(Blizzard whooshes)


Simon?

What's the matter?

lt's...so cold!

l can't...breathe.
