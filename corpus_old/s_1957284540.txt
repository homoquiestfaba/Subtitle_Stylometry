[ Crowd Cheering,
Whistling ]

HEY, YO, COACH. SHORTY

CA NOT MAKE IT TO THE GAME.

WELL, WHERE IS HE ?
RIKERS ISLAND.

MAN, THAT EYE LOOKS SO BAD.
HAVE YOU SEEN A DOCTOR ?

THEY GET YOU
A DOCTOR IN HERE ?

WHAT HAPPENED ?

SHORTY, MY BEST FRIEND
IS THE BEST CRIMINAL LAWYER
IN BROOKLYN.

SHE COULD REALLY HELP YOU.
YOU GOTTA TALK TO ME.

COME ON !

THEY SAID I TRIED
TO SHOOT SOMEBODY.

DID YOU ?

NO.

SO WHY DIDTHEY SAY YOU DID ?

THIS KID IN MY CREW TRIED TO
SHOOT SOMEBODY,

AND THEY CAUGHT ME OUT
THERE WITH HIS GUN.

I AM GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

I AM GONNA GET YOU OUT.
YOU HEAR ME ?

WHATEVER.

CASE 1475,
STATE V. RUSSELL.

MR. RUSSELL, HAVE A SEAT
RIGHT OVER HERE.

GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.
TO WHAT DO WE OWE
THE PLEASURE, MS. BLUM ?

WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A CLEAR
MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE...

ON BEHALF OF
MR. TAREEK RUSSELL.

THIS YOUNG MAN
IS A DECENT STUDENT,
A STAR BASKETBALL PLAYER,

AND HE SHOWS UP FOR ALL
HIS PROBATION APPOINTMENTS
AND THERAPY.

IT SAYS HERE HE IS
IN VIOLATION OF A NUMBER
OF CONDITIONS OF HIS PAROLE.

I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
HE MAY BE INVOLVED IN MORE
SERIOUS CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.

NO, THATS IMPOSSIBLE, JUDGE.

AND YOU ARE ?

UM, I AM PHYLLIS SAROKA,
SHORTYS COACH.

YOU SEE, ON THE NIGHT OF THE
CRIME, SHORTY WAS ACTUALLY
AT THE MOVIES WITH ME.

I HAVE TICKET STUBS
AND WITNESSES
WHO CAN TESTIFY.

YOU ARE AWARE
THAT PERJURY IS A CRIME,
ARE YOU NOT, MS. SAROKA ?

YOUR HONOR, MAY I
APPROACH THE BENCH ?

CERTAINLY,
MS. BLUM.
THANK YOU.

THE OTHER KID INVOLVED IN THIS
HAS NOT SHOWN UP TO
ANY OF THE PROCEEDINGS.

HE HAS THREE
OUTSTANDING WARRANTS
AND A FELONY.

TAREEK IS A GOOD KID.

MR. RUSSELL,
ITS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO BE A LITTLE GOOD,

TO STAND A LITTLE
ON THIS SIDE OF THE FENCE,
A LITTLE ON THAT,

TO GO TO SCHOOL
AND CARRY A GUN, TO PLAY
BASKETBALL AND SELL DRUGS.

YOU DO UNDERSTAND
WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT,
MR. RUSSELL, DO NOT YOU ?

YES, MADAM.

IN MY COURTROOM,
YOU HAD BETTER BE ALL GOOD
OR ITS GOOD-BYE.

I WILL THROW YOU TO THE
WOLVES, AND I PROMISE YOU,

THEY ARE THERE,
WAITING FOR YOU.

PROBATION IS A PRIVILEGE.
DO YOU HEAR ME ?

YES, MADAM.

IT IS NOT
TO BE ABUSED.

AT THE MOMENT, I AM IMPRESSED
BY YOUR COUNSELS ARGUMENTS,

SO I AM RESTORING
YOUR PROBATION.

NOW THAT MEANS THAT I DO NOT
EXPECT TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD

ABOUT YOU GETTIN
INTO TROUBLE.

THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
