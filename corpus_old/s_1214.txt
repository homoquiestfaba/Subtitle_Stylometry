Jeez, this is terrible.

It's the stupidest.
I can't--

It's an hour's difference.
The time zone is different here.

Fuck. It's unbelievable.
How the fuck can that happen?

Okay. Here.

Okay, there. That's done.
Now what?

Okay. Got it. Okay.

Pull it up.

Okay, now let's get your...

A few years ago, we wanted to...

try to help out with some activist's
anti-corporate activities.

And we heard about this website
called rtmark.com.

And we went there, and they--

they handed us a domain name--
gwbush.com--

and asked us if we might like
to make a website

that was critical of George Bush.

Because George Bush's real
domain name was georgewbush.com.

And this was 1999,
so it was just during the campaign

when he was beginning
to run for president.

And we didn't really know
quite what to do,

so we went to Bush's website
and looked at it.

And it turned out to be full
of strange hypocrisies, like,

for example, he called himself
"The environmental governor of Texas,"

but we looked a little closer
at his record and found out

that he had actually created
the most polluted state in the country

because he dismantled
the Clean Air Laws while he was there.

And, actually, that's, I guess,
what he's doing now nationally.

So we thought,
"Well, this kind of hypocrisy

we can easily poke fun at
by making a satire website."

And we made this satire website
that looked exactly like Bush's

except for a few key differences.

Like there was a photo on the banner--

instead of him and his wife
in front of the capitol building in Texas,

we showed him pointing the finger
at black people.

And this seemed to get him
a little bit angry.

So the Bush campaign
tried to shut us down

by sending us
a cease and desist letter

and by complaining
to the Federal Election Commission.

But we were able
to just take those threats

and send them to the media.

And immediately the <i>New York Times</i>
wrote an article,

and there were a whole bunch
of other articles.

In fact, one reporter
read these articles and,

at a press conference,
asked Bush,

"So, what about this website--
gwbush.com--what do you think of that?"

So it was all over the place.

A lot of people read about it,

including a guy who had another
domain name called gatt.org.

And, of course, GATT is the
Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,

and it's the predecessor agreement
to the World Trade Organization.

And he said,
"If you could do this for Bush,

then maybe you can
also do this for the WTO."

The WTO is supposed to be
sort of a United Nations of commerce,

a conglomeration
of all these countries in the world...

that get together every now and then
to discuss trade policies

in how exactly goods will be bought
and sold throughout the world.

I'm sure, originally,
the stated purpose of the WTO

was to help these countries
who are developing

so that, you know, the world community
can help raise them out of poverty.

In fact, what it's done is
it's allowed large corporations

to go in and exploit these people
even further

so that Americans
become even wealthier

and the people in these countries
continue to struggle to get by.

And I think that's--
at this point it's upset quite a few people.

So I gotta try
and remember where Sal lives.

It's a little bit complicated. There's, like,
this snaking road up over the hills.

And who is Sal?

Sal is a friend who I met in San Diego,

and he moved to L.A.
to work in the movie industry,

and that's why now he does,
actually, costuming professionally.

He builds, like, weird suits

out of pretty much
any material you can imagine.

And so, when we needed a costume,
I knew who to call.

Yeah, this is it. Yeah.

I'll maybe bring him his mail, actually,
as long as we're at it here.

Yeah--I don't like it.
Okay.

It looks too much like sex stuff
instead of--it's not very modern-looking.

Remember, this is the future.
This isn't about, like, straps and stuff.

That's like dungeons and torture
in the past.

The costume
is a manager's leisure suit.

And the idea is that Hank Hardy Unruh,

the representative
from the World Trade Organization,

is going to go and wear
this breakaway business suit

that's gonna be pulled off of him

during the middle
of the keynote address to the conference.

And then a big inflatable phallus
is going to emerge from this golden suit,

and on the end of it is a TV screen

that he uses
to manage sweatshops remotely.

The reason we got invited
to these things

is we have a website
called gatt.org.

The gatt.org website looks a lot
like the WTO website,

but it is critical of the WTO.

Most people, though,
who find gatt.org

by searching
for the World Trade Organization...

will go without reading it
and will send us e-mail directly.

So a lot of people ask us
weird questions about tariffs and trade,

and we try to answer
as accurately as we can.

And occasionally invitations come in

from official
or quasi-official organizations

asking for opinions
or asking us to attend a conference.

And so, when they ask, they really think
they're talking to the WTO,

and we respond by giving them
what we think they want--

which is the opinions of the WTO--

as accurately
as we can represent them.

You know what I'm thinking,
actually, looking at this...

is that maybe this is a zipper.

Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

Then he just unzips it
and pulls the thing at the same time.

That could be really good.
Because...

to have it burst out of the Velcro,
it might not be strong enough to burst out,

and then he'd have to pull it.

Part of the thing
that gives us the courage

to go to Tampere...
with this really absurd suit

is that we already went
to Salzburg, Austria, to represent

the World Trade Organization
at a conference on tariffs and trade.

There, our representative--the same guy
who is Hank Hardy Unruh here--

was Dr. Andreas Bichlbauer there.

And he gave a lecture that focused

on basically doing away with
all customs in the name of free trade,

like getting rid of the <i>siesta</i>
in Spain and Italy

so that business hours
could be the same.

In Italy, on the other hand,
you have a totally different situation,

in which sleep is...done during
the day as much as at night almost.

And allowing people to sell their votes
over the Internet to the highest bidder

so that the barriers to free trade
and things like votes were out of the way.

One possible solution is being tested
in the field of American politics

to streamline the grotesquely
inefficient system of elections.

Vote-auction.com, in turn,
employs only four people

to transmit not merely information,

but actual money
directly to the consuming voter.

It's a--a forum for people voluntarily
to offer their vote to the highest bidder.

And despite giving what we thought

was a lecture that would immediately
get us booed off stage

or get Bichlbauer
maybe even thrown in jail

because people would figure out
he was an impostor,

the exact opposite happened.

Everybody was super polite.

It didn't seem like everybody even noticed
that what he said was so absurd.

Well, so far...

...we thought Bichlbauer
would be very extreme

and people would react to it
and we'd get shut down,

and nothing of the sort happened.

So...this time we just have to really
push it and make it totally extreme.

I mean, we keep trying
to push things further

to try to really clarify the positions
of the WTO to make them very legible.

It's one back,
but this--this is good.

<i>Andy.</i>

It has a terrible siren.

I have to check the Web
when we get upstairs.

Oh, my God. What are we
gonna do about this--

we gotta watch the Patrick video.

It's weird stuff, isn't it?

That's one way of putting it.

It's really a problem.

It seems about the weirdest
I've seen from him ever, I think.

It looks pretty good on this.

Yeah, it's all right.

What we have here is that we have
our cyber Andy here

who's going to be wearing the suit.

And I'm going to be showing
all the different ways

in which the Management Leisure Suit
can be useful in industry today

and maximize leisure potential.

Sometimes I don't think they know
what the hell to expect out of me.

What I'll come up with...

is frequently not exactly
what they had in mind,

but it's...you know,

it fits in perfectly with what they're--
what they're going to do.

Well, I came out
of a corporate environment

and a company that I really gave,
you know, a good bit of my soul to

over a long period of time progressively.

And there were a lot of downsizings
and, of course,

the company I was with I thought
was gonna take care of me.

And I realized
that the bottom line is the bottom line,

and there really isn't any humanity
in corporate structures,

so therefore I hope that maybe
being part of the Yes Men

might, in some way, help raise issues
about global work issues

and social issues that are being
brought about by globalization, etcetera.

I grew up in the suburbs here,

and then I moved to Troy six years ago
for a job at the university.

There's a place there called Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, and I teach there.

I was moving back home, really,
because I'd been away--

I'd been on the West Coast
for about 12 years.

Wait, what is this?

This is--it's this...

...SimCopter hack.
Here it is.

I wanted to watch this tape
'cause this is the tape--

I've been cleaning out the archives,
and I found this tape in there.

I met Andy through a friend, actually.
A mutual friend.

Actually, two people
that we both knew

suggested that me and Andy
get in contact with one another

because we'd both
done similar projects.

One of the jobs that I had was
at this games company called Maxis

that makes SimCity.

One of the games they were making
at the time was SimCopter.

I was in charge of the little people
that run around in the game.

And I made them
wearing nothing but swim trunks.

They'd all be boys, and they'd
be running around kissing each other.

So all the people who ordered
this very popular video game

suddenly were treated
to a completely different spectacle.

So he got a lot
of press attention for it,

and it was seen as a kind of--
an activist kind of statement

about video games and the sort
of macho nature of them.

It all involves
the unexpected appearance

of some gay, kissing muscle men
every Friday the 13th.

He's becoming a celebrity of sorts
in the computer world--

especially the gay computer world.

And then I had done a project
using Barbie dolls,

where we switched the voice boxes
of Barbie dolls and G.I. Joes.

<i>Troops! Attack that Cobra jet</i>
<i>with heavy firepower!</i>

And that ended up in G.I. Joes that
said things like, "I love to shop with you,"

and Barbie dolls that said things like,
"Dead men tell no lies."

And we got them back
on store shelves

all over the country in what we called
our "Shop Giving Program."

We're like Santa Claus,
only less radical,

because Santa Claus
breaks into people's houses. We don't.

So that when kids
got them at Christmas,

they were surprised to find their doll

saying something other
than what they expected.

And the kids thought it was hilarious.
They loved having these crazy dolls.

We sent out press releases,

so it was in the news on Christmas Day
and for the week following.

It just went through every kind
of media channel imaginable.

<i>- The B.L.O...</i>
<i>- The Mission of the B.L.O...</i>

<i>The Barbie Liberation Organization--</i>
<i>the B.L.O...</i>

<i>It was real funny 'cause it looks</i>
<i>like, "Come on, fight me. Fight me!"</i>

<i>- Except it says...</i>
<i>- I love school. Don't you?</i>

<i>Let's sing with the band tonight!</i>

Now we're--with the Yes Men,

we're calling that sort of basic idea
"Identity Correction,"

like saying, these things--

these things that are not
really presenting themselves honestly

or that hide something about their nature
that's really scary,

we want to bring that out.

We want to show that.
We want to demonstrate that.

And so, like for the WTO--

we think that the WTO

is doing all these terrible things
that are hurting people

and they're saying the exact opposite.

And so we're interested
in correcting their identity.

In the same way that an identity thief
steals somebody's identity

in order to basically
just engage in criminal practices,

we target people
we see as criminals,

and we steal their identity
to try to make them honest

or to try to present
a more honest face.

And so...you know,
I guess this whole thing

has its roots for both me and Andy

in stuff that we've been doing
for a long time,

which is trying to create public spectacles
that, in some kind of poetic way,

reveal something about our culture
that's profoundly a problem.

That must be Sal.

Oh, dude.
Are you okay?

I got fuckin' lost on that...

Oh, no.

It's been a long day.

Holy shit!

Well, I probably started it
in June or July.

So, on and off
for a good two to three months.

Just a couple more pieces
of Velcro, and that'll really be it.

And, yeah, we're...
at the end of the line.

Okay, look.
So we're making a list here.

Wednesday we leave
for Finland early,

so, Sunday...

make lecture.

Bigger?
Oh, no. That's a big one.

PowerPoint...
and then speech.

Finish.

It's 4:03 a.m., and I guess
I'll just keep working until morning.

I feel...somewhat awake.

And then Andy can take over again.

We can do
around-the-clock shifts, I guess.

I'm just trying to add a few slides
into the PowerPoint here.

Because, actually, a lot of the things
that business leaders of the world

say in relation to these issues
are actually sort of very similar

to what Unruh Hank Hardy says,

even though maybe Unruh Hank Hardy
is a little bit more frank about it.

And, in fact,
when he talked to CNBC,

when he was debating,

an activist, Barry Coates,
just sort of agreed with what he said

when he said that this is what
the WTO does, and this is our position.

And Barry Coates said,
"Well, that's funny. That's exactly right."

So...after Salzburg, we got an e-mail
asking a representative of the WTO

to appear on CNBC
MarketWrap Europe.

And the producer apparently didn't notice
that gatt.org was not the WTO site.

And Granwyth Hulatberi, which is
another name that Andy just came up with,

responded and, of course, said,

"Well, I'd be happy to go
on CNBC MarketWrap."

And the producer wanted him to debate
an anti-globalization protester.

If the WTO is serious about addressing
the issues of world poverty,

it would do things
completely differently than it is now.

Let me bring in Granwyth on that.
Is that a fair point?

Well, of course it is, but I think Barry,
as well as all the other protesters,

are simply, in a word, focused too much
on reality and on facts and figures.

And I think I would have to say
that this is a long-term problem

that comes down
to a problem of education.

We have to find a way to convince
perhaps not the protesters

but the protesters' children

to follow thinkers like Milton Friedman
and Darwin and--and so on,

rather than what the protesters
have been reared on--

Trotsky and Robespierre
and Abbie Hoffman.

And I think that putting
the direction of education,

being put into private hands--

a concentration of resources
in the private sector--

will naturally lead to this result,

and we'll see
the protesters' children being reared

with an entirely different
set of concerns.

Let me bring you in on that, Barry.

Can--can I just say

that these kind of simplistic arguments

are really, I mean, too insulting
to most people to believe.

The fact that we have a choice between
Milton Friedman or Abbie Hoffman

for where we get our source
of economic history and philosophy.

There are many, many thinkers
from around the world--

just not those ones
employed by the WTO--

that think the World Trade Organization
policies are deeply damaging

for the development prospects
of the poorest countries.

Let me go out to Granwyth.

Yes. Well, I wanted to speak
to Granwyth--sorry--to Barry's point

that there are other thinkers.

Well, who actually has the power
in the world, and so who is correct

in this kind of world view?

I mean, I think the answer is easy.

And if you look at the views
held by myself, my organization,

and many, many
of the decision-makers in the world--

the powerful people--they happen
to coincide with what I'm explaining.

And I think this is enough
in this sort of view.

Briefly, Barry.

So, I mean--what we have here

is a picture of the rich and powerful people
believe a certain philosophy

which they then propound
through the institutions

in which they have a powerful voice.

And I think this is exactly the model
that is being questioned.

And, increasingly, what there is
is a very large body

of people who are concerned
about these rules.

The people on the streets
of Genoa and Seattle

are not representative
of the overall movement.

They are the tip of the iceberg.

We did a study last year
that looked across developing countries

and found that in the space
of one year, in 50 protests,

more than a million people
from developing countries

were out trying to change the rules

that were being imposed on them
by the World Bank and the IMF

and locked down
through the World Trade Organization.

Thank you. We must finish.
Barry Coates, thank you for joining us.

And also Granwyth Hulatberi and
Vernon Ellis on the line from New York.

Section three?

Well...

It's not exactly a garment bag,
but it's, uh...

...it'll work.

Yeah? You think this
is very business-like?

It's like very official?

Very...very big money.

Okay, good. That's what I need.
I need a big money watch.

So are you as nervous
as you were for Salzburg?

The thing is, like,
even with the Salzburg thing,

we went into it, like...

sort of--we went there really nervous,
but the whole time kind of--

it doesn't really sink in
till you're actually there.

Right.

Well, I think it's good you guys,
from what I've seen of the speech,

it kind of starts out
the most normal that it is,

so that he can get comfortable,
and people--

he can sort of slowly
work his way up into it.

Son of a fucking bitch.

Shit.

Yeah, do you have a rag? Fuck.

Shit. I have one that has shoe polish
on it, but that's not right, right?

The screen get a little paint on it?
Yeah.

It sounds like a lawn mower.
It's a little loud, yeah.

That's not good.
Forget it.

Look, it made a new noise.
Good. Good. Good. Great.

Is it great?
Try it.

It doesn't work now.

Oh, listen! Yeah.
There it goes!

Gotta hurry!

Okay, ten minutes.
They're both here.

Hey, Sal.

Thanks.

Good luck.

We'll see how it goes.
Thanks for everything.

Yeah, sleep good.
Have a good time here.

Enjoy.
See you soon.

Move into my room.
Have enjoyment.

Okay.

Is this everything?
Wow. Look how efficient.

Okay.

Efficient.
A model of efficiency right here.

You have some crap on your face
right here. No, over here.

Much better.

We arrived last night.

You had to take a nap.
You had to get some sleep.

I just crashed, yeah.

And I went and basically
scoped out the lecture site.

There was a sign on the door
that said, "Textiles of the Future,"

Unruh Hank Hardy was
the first speaker--Hank Hardy Unruh.

And, you know,
it all looked sort of official.

The coffee cups were out
for the morning.

So I thought,
"This is great. I'm all ready.

I know exactly where it is.
We can go there."

I had a time--
I set up a little timetable,

I got maps of the thing and all
the updated conference information.

Came back here.
Then we went to sleep early.

Hank was snoring immediately,
but I wasn't able to sleep at all, really.

I just stayed there awake in bed

and occasionally I'd go in the bathroom
and turn on the light and read brochures

because I was, like,
just unable to sleep.

And eventually I think I fell asleep
just before waking up.

Great.

So I'm leaving my wallet here.

Okay, let's go.

Wait.
It's 8:00.

I think I really will leave it here.

Are you coming?

Hank, this is a little early
to get up.

It's all right.
I mean, I thought this was a vacation.

Like what?
A vacation.

I know.

I wanna go on a vacation.
They take me to Finland...

Let me take care of this egg for you.
I'll just peel it.

That'll be nice. Thank you.

But we're behind schedule.
Are we?

A little bit. It's after 8:00, and I really
wanted to be at the venue at 8:00.

Okay.
But we're doing fine.

Is it after 8:00?
It is after 8:00.

Yeah.

You know, pretend like...

Great. We're early.

Oh, good.

Hello, I'm Hank Hardy Unruh.
I'm from the--

Oh, right. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

We were expecting you.
Oh, good.

It's not 9:30--no.
It's 8:30, right?

But you will have a...
It's 8:30 now...is it?

lt...is...it's 9:30, yes.

Now?
Yes.

Yeah.
The time is 9:30?

Yes.
Yeah. Almost.

I'm on at...
It's 27 past 9:00 at the moment.

Oh, my God.
We're an hour off.

Oh, my God. Thank you.
You're welcome.

Well, we have to--we start in three--
Anyhow, it was nice to see you.

Do they know
that he's going on now?

Yeah--well,
...was expecting you.

Oh, jeez. Okay.
Okay, we...

Are you coming, too?
Have you registered?

I'm his assistant.
We're both working with him.

We have to go take care
of a few things now.

Here it is.
Okay.

Would you like to join the dinner?
Yes, please.

Is there a fee, or...
No, it's included.

Okay. Yes, we'll--
we'll join the dinner. That's great.

Wow.
We must hurry, I guess.

Yes. I will accompany you.
Please. Yes.

Actually, no, you can't go in now

'cause you first have
to take care of that business.

We're an hour--we're...
we had an hour off.

I have to do something.
Yes.

He has to make
a very important phone call right now.

It'll take me five minutes.
Right now?

I'm sorry.

But you will have your presentation
starting after two minutes.

Please tell them
that I'll be three minutes late.

Well, there's a detail.

Jesus. Fuck.
How come we didn't know that?

I don't know.
That's really incredible.

Come on.
Okay. Pick up.

Jeez, this is terrible.

It's the stupidest--
I can't...

There's--it's an hour's difference.
The time zone is different here.

It's unbelievable.
How the fuck can that happen?

Okay, there. That's done now.
Ladies and gentlemen...

Okay, quick,
that shirt--the underwear.

The gold underwear.

Okay...

Do I have to put
something through here?

No.
Okay.

Need help?

Your testicles hanging out?
Uh, yeah.

Okay.

Here you go.

Okay. Great.

Oh, God.
Okay...great.

It's got a little air in it.
Okay, now the pants.

Hurry.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry.

Thank you.
I'm terribly sorry--

Yes, I have my presentation.

Terribly sorry.

I think the World Trade Organization is
supposed to know about time zones, but...

Somebody said,
"Isn't there a time difference?"

And I said, "Nope.
All of Europe, same time zone."

So that convinced us all.
Me too.

We were convinced that it was the right
time, and we woke up this morning...

And we were running five
or ten minutes late,

and then figured out
that the laptop wasn't working.

No, maybe we could switch the order.

Could we have somebody else go,
and then I go later?

They said, "I think we can do that."

Then they called the coffee people
and talked to the coffee people

to see if the coffee was possible.

That was it.

Thank you very much.

This one...

It's quite an honor to be here
in Tampere addressing this audience

of the most outstanding
textile workers in the world today.

I see on all the faces here today
a touching childlike eagerness

to tackle the biggest
textiles questions in the world.

How do we at the WTO fit in?

What we want to do at the WTO
is help you achieve your dollar results.

And in just 20 minutes from now,

I'm going to show you
the WTO's very own solution

to two of the very biggest problems
in management.

One--maintaining rapport
with distant workforce,

and two--maintaining
healthful amounts of leisure.

This solution, appropriately enough,
is based in textiles.

But how did workers
ever get to be a problem?

Before unveiling our solution,

I'd like to talk a bit about the history
of the worker management problem.

We all know about the American
Civil War--at least in the U.S.

It was the bloodiest, least-profitable war
in the history of our country.

A war in which unbelievably
huge amounts of money

went right down the drain--
and all for textiles.

By the 1860s, the South
was utterly flush with cash.

It had recently benefited
from the cotton gin--

an invention that took
the seeds out of cotton

and the South
out of its pre-industrial past.

Hundreds of thousands of workers

previously unemployed
in their countries of origin

were given useful jobs in textiles.

Into this rosy picture of freedom
and boom stepped--you guessed it--

the North.

Now, some Civil War apologists have said
that the Civil War, for all its faults,

at least had the effect of outlawing

an involuntarily imported
workforce model of work.

Now, this model is, of course,
a terrible thing.

I myself am an abolitionist.

But, in fact, there is no doubt
that, left to their own devices,

markets would've eventually replaced
slavery with cleaner sources of labor.

To prove my point,
please join me

on what Albert Einstein used to call
a thought experiment.

Suppose involuntarily imported labor
had never been outlawed.

That slaves still existed,
and that it were easy to own one.

What do you think it would cost today
to profitably maintain a slave,

say, here in Tampere?

Let's see...a finished clothing set
costs $50 at the very least.

Two meals from McDonald's
cost about $10.00.

The cheapest small room
probably runs for about $250 a month.

To function well, you have to pay
for your slave's health care.

If its country of origin was polluted,
for example, that might run expensively.

And, of course, what with
child labor laws here in Finland,

much of the youth market
is simply not available.

Now leave the same slave
back at home. Let's say Gabon.

In Gabon, $10 pays
for two weeks of food.

$250 pays for two years
of housing, not a month, at best.

$50 pays for a lifetime
of budget clothing.

And health care is,
of course, cheaper.

On top of it all...youth can be
gainfully employed without restriction.

The biggest benefit
of the remote labor system, though,

is to the slave him or herself,

because in Gabon there is no need
for the slave not to be free.

This is primarily because

there are no one-time
slave transport costs to recoup

and so the potential losses
from fleeing

are limited to the slave's
rudimentary training.

Since the slave can be free,

he or she suddenly becomes
a worker rather than a slave.

Also terrific for morale
is that slaves--workers--

have the luxury of remaining
in their native habitat

and don't have to relocate to places
where they would be subject

to such unpleasantries
as homesickness and racism.

I think it's clear
from our little thought experiment

that if the North and South
had simply let the market sort it out

without protectionist tariffs,

they would've quickly given up slavery
for something more efficient anyhow.

By forcing the issue,

the North not only committed a terrible
injustice against the freedom of the South,

but also deprived slavery

of its natural development
into remote labor.

Had the leaders
of the 1860s United States

understood what our leaders
understand today,

the Civil War
would never have happened.

In a world where the headquarters
of a company might be in New York,

Hong Kong, or Espoo, Finland,

and the workers are in Gabon,
Rangoon, or Estonia,

how does a manager maintain
proper rapport with the workers,

and how does he or she
ensure from a distance

that workers perform their work
in an ethical fashion?

I'm about to show you
an actual prototype

of the WTO's solution to two major
management problems of today.

Now, we all know that not even
the best workplace design

can help even the most
astute manager keep track of workers.

What you need is a solution that enables
complete rapport with workers--

especially when they're
located far away.

Mike, would you help me a moment?

Thank you.

This is much better.
Much more comfortable.

This is the WTO's answer to two
of the major management problems,

and we're calling it
the Management Leisure Suit.

It's--the two problems again--

how to maintain close rapport
with distant workers

and how to remain comfortable
and increase leisure activities.

How does
the Management Leisure Suit work?

Besides being extremely comfortable,
as I can guarantee you.

Well, allow me to describe
the suit's core features.

This...

This is the E.V.A.--

the Employee Visualization Appendage.

It's an instantly deployable,
hip-mounted device

with totally hands-free operation...

that allows the manager to see
his employees directly right here.

Signals communicating the exact
amounts and quality of physical work

are transmitted
not only visually right here,

but directly through electric channels
implanted directly into the manager.

The workers, for their part, are fitted
with corresponding transmitting chips

that are implanted humanely
directly into the shoulder.

But the other equally important
achievement of the MLS

has to do with leisure.

In the United States, leisure--
another word for freedom, really--

has been decreasing steadily
since the 1970s.

The Management Leisure Suit
permits the manager to reverse this trend

by letting him do his work anywhere

while remaining
in complete touch with the workers,

physically sensing what's going on
in the workforce, on the floor,

through channels implanted
directly into the manager.

Again, the manager
sees the employees,

but also feels what they're feeling

and can select where to focus
in the workplace environment.

So, in conclusion,

I'd like to ask,
is this a science-fiction scenario?

The answer is no.

Everything we've seen here,
everything we've been talking about

is entirely possible today.

We can always look forward
on the highways of progress

towards ever-new horizons

with cooperation and mutual delight
in the fruits of prosperity.

I'm very excited to be here.
Thank you very much.

Something we're trying
to do more and more as...

I wasn't depressed
by people not reacting,

I wasn't depressed by people just
swallowing it and not asking questions

because I thought, "Well, that shows
that you need some sort of control,"

because the WTO--me--
can come in

and say these amazingly hideous things
to this group of the most educated people,

like the top .1% education-wise people
in the entire world

in a developed country
like Finland--

these people all have PhDs
or advanced degrees--

and you can say
the most atrocious things

and nobody will really react
and nobody will really care.

It's like, you know,
what can't corporations get away with?

So, where are we?

Well, we're arriving
in Helsinki right now.

We left the conference this morning.

It was just--it had driven us
completely mad after dinner last night.

I think we had our fill with dinner.

I had to actually leave
a little bit early.

I went over to the table where Unruh--

Hank Hardy had to sit
with the big men and eat,

and I told him
that we needed to leave

because we had a telephone meeting
with Mobutu Oblongatu immediately.

Great.
Hi.

Sorry to butt in a minute,

but we're supposed to meet
Manduka Djubango...

Oh, God.
...at 10:00.

And then we both started laughing,

which was really not convenient
for the context.

So we left, and we just decided
that, basically,

we couldn't figure out what else
we could possibly do at this conference,

so we just thought, "Well,
let's go to Helsinki instead."

So, this is the paper.

On the front page--
I just discovered it--

it says there's a seminar
at the university

and that somebody talked
about controlling remote workers

with electrical impulsions.

And then you turn to the page, and...

...and that's what you get.

And this right here represents
the World Trade Organization.

This... <i>is</i>
the World Trade Organization.

I went down to these
Mexican border towns in the mid '80s.

They were called "Maquilladoras"

when they had
the first trade agreements

between Mexico and the United States.

And everyone was saying, "This is
gonna raise Mexico out of poverty,"

and things were gonna be so great,
and within ten years,

they'd all be driving
shiny new cars in Mexico.

And I went down there and saw this--

the incredible poverty
in these Mexican border towns.

Fifteen years later, I went back.
Not a damn thing had changed.

Here's all these workers working
for all these American corporations,

and you just go across the street

and you found people
living in the same horrid conditions,

the same poverty existing.

And you had to ask,
"Well, who's benefiting from this?"

Who benefited were
these American corporations.

During the 1990s,
they became even more wealthy,

they posted record profits--
larger record profits,

and the people in Mexico
just continued to suffer.

It was all a big scam.

Is this the one?

No. You got the wrong one.

Shit.

"Will WTO stand up?"

Oh, my God. It's got pictures.
They're nice, too.

Yeah, they actually look okay
at that size.

"Bichlbaum isn't...
but he plays one on TV."

This is basically the core
of what we do.

All of these newspapers
and magazines have articles

on the Yes Men,

and this is why
we are doing these things.

This is why we go
and do these conferences.

It's not for the 200 people
or the hundred people

that might see us give the lecture.

Although we'd like them to come away

with an interesting experience
from the lecture,

the reason we do it is so that people
who read <i>Bizarre</i> magazine

or the <i>New York Times</i>
or <i>Fortune</i> or <i>Harper's</i>

can read about it
in the mainstream press.

This is how millions of people
could read about it

and potentially get turned on
to some of the ideas of anti-globalization.

One of the problems
with the <i>Fortune</i> thing

is that it's in this--
well, <i>Fortune--</i>

it's read by business people
and accountants and that kind of thing.

And that's exactly who we're supposed
to be talking to in Australia in May.

It's an accounting conference.

It's a little...
a little worrisome.

You need a new shirt?
One that's not wrinkled?

Yeah.

Will that be good with your thing?

Do you think it'll work
with your suit?

This one's extra large. Yeah, they'll all
work with my suit. It's terrible.

It's striped, though. Is that okay?
Yeah.

Sure it's okay.
Why don't you go get a shirt, then?

I'll just get this. Wait.
Oh, it's not very much cotton.

How much is it?
I hate that.

35%?
It's 35%. It's like...

No, it's fine for--

It doesn't wrinkle much--
that's nice about that.

I'll just wear it. All right.

The thing is, there's a question
of whether he's--

at what point he recognizes you
doesn't really matter.

What we want is that moment
when he does recognize you.

So if he recognizes you here
and sees that you're in the room,

then he'll be looking back and forth
at you, at the screen.

At that point, if he recognizes you,
we better say something.

No, I think it's down here,
but I don't know.

It must be right down Morris.

Remember we walked...

It's on the end of this line here.

Thanks.

Andy, hi. How're you doing?
Barry. Nice to meet you.

Good to meet you.
Good. Great.

We're in London,

and we were just at the offices
of the World Development Movement

where we talked to Barry Coates,

who's the director
of the World Development Movement

and who showed up
on CNBC MarketWrap Europe

debating our friend here--
Granwyth Hulatberi--

about the prospects of WTO
and globalization.

We kind of expected him maybe to have
a glimmer of recognition immediately,

and he didn't--okay.

Then we put on the tape and...

he laughed
at how horribly stupid it was,

but he never realized

that this wasn't really
a representative of the WTO.

Even when he saw me
like this right next to him,

and then we switched seats
and he still didn't notice.

Then I had to put my face
next to the thing and go...

Yeah, let's just pause it here.

Okay. Hit stop.
Is there a pause?

Stop button.
There's no pause.

I don't know what I could've said
after that clip.

I mean...really...

"Where did they get this guy from?"
might've been my first comment.

So did you ever figure out
where they got the guy from?

I understood that he was in the External
Relations Department for the WTO.

That's what they thought, too.
That's what they thought, as well.

But...
But...

...as it happens, he wasn't.
Yeah.

In fact--
Just take one more close look.

Wait, can we--is this reverse?

No!

I wasn't gonna mention the likeness.

You were being very polite,
weren't you? Yeah.

Yeah.
You did it as a spoof?

Yeah.
Yeah. Basically...

That's good. We weren't sure
how you would react.

We were really hoping you wouldn't be
too offended. We were like, "Oh, no!"

Hell, no. That's great.
That's really--

I was wondering,
'cause I hadn't seen that guy before,

and I did know some of the WTO
External Relations people,

and I was thinking, "My God,
they really put up a right one this time."

We wanted to talk
to Barry Coates as well

because he has a lot of statistics
and information about globalization

that we thought would be useful
for the lecture in Australia.

All of the WTO agreements bar one

are all about restricting
what governments can do.

And so, essentially, the whole
trading system is built on the premise

that the companies trading internationally,
investing internationally,

are going to be preyed upon
by nasty governments.

And, really, what we have

is an international system
that is entirely the reverse.

What's got squeezed out of the system

is democracy,
is development, is environment,

is the kind of human values

which really ought to be the center
of what we're trying to do.

We don't live to trade, you know.

We live to have decent lives.

And that ought to be the goal
of our trade policy,

not maximizing trade
or getting rid of any impediments to it.

Looks good.
I've got that.

Need to get the video...

...and we'll be off.

Let's see...

One of the big reasons
why I'm up here

is that we have the Australia gig
for the Yes Men.

I did an animation about the recycling
of post-consumer waste

into hamburgers and fast food.

So...here we go.

The answer to the world's
sustainable food future is in recycling.

Since over half our nutrients
taken in are eliminated,

valuable resources are at risk.

By using post-consumer waste,
reBurger allows essential nutrients

to be offered to developing countries
for greatly reduced cost.

Okay...

It gets better.

Wait.
What was that?

Was that in outer space?
What the hell was that?

I think it does the job.
I think it does the job.

We're here in New York
because Herb Alpert,

of Herb Alpert
and the Tijuana Brass,

gave us this award.

A bunch of money to do
the kind of stuff that we do.

So we had to come here
and have dinner with him

and get the money
and thank everybody.

It was very nice
and very surprising.

But we're very pleased.
I think we can say we're very pleased.

Yeah, it was a big chunk of money.

It's gonna bankroll a lot
of future activities like going to Australia.

Yeah, so we got
this chunk of money but,

of course, now we're
also using this opportunity

and this hotel room here in New York
to meet up with Matt

who's been working on the PowerPoint
presentation for Australia,

and to meet up with Patrick

who's been working on animations
for Australia as well.

Fortunately we were lucky, too,
because Snafu was in town.

He's sort of a European Yes Man.

He's been circulating
in the European scene

doing Yes Men-type activities.

But it's a good thing
he's here in the States

so he could go
to Plattsburgh with us.

Yes, trade liberalization
is a religious undertaking.

A project of faith, a crusade of sorts,
and it has been

ever since its founders declared
that financial success comes from God

and that wealth
is a sign of divine favor.

Now, why is starvation a problem?
First, the facts.

As we all know, investment
and exports have been on the rise...

There's some bad news.

There's some really bad news
that came down in the last two days.

The conference in Australia--

the people from the conference
in Australia wrote an e-mail

saying that the conference has been
canceled because of low enrollment.

In some ways
it's really kind of, I guess,

a nice thing
that there was underenrollment

because it was really
a hideous conference

and it seemed like a really dire thing

that people would actually
want to go to that thing.

And so, it's really
encouraging for humanity

that the conference
actually has been canceled.

But at the same time, it's really
made things difficult for us.

So I wrote back to them
as Hildegard West

and I asked them if they
would please set up another venue

because Kinnithrung Sprat
is already en route to Australia.

So right now I'm waiting to see
if they come back to us

with a suggestion that they'll actually
have a public presentation,

but since the conference
has been canceled,

now the event in Plattsburgh might be
the only venue we have for this lecture.

So it's really important now that we get
the lecture done and sort of together.

So it's no longer a dress rehearsal.
It's actually, like, the final production.

It's about time.

I was so worried about your shoes.

This guy brought
real shoes for you. Look.

Do we have the hamburgers yet?

We have to pick them up.
You mentioned--

They're ordered.
Richard ordered them already.

That's fantastic.
We pick them up?

Basically, there's this guy
named Richard Robbins who I met

at a conference
about a month ago,

and he has written
several books on globalization.

He was interested
in having the WTO

come speak
at the Economics Department.

Only he really knows that this
isn't really the WTO.

Everybody else will think
that it's the WTO.

But another good thing is
that it will be a hungry audience,

so there's a good chance
they are going to eat those hamburgers,

which we weren't sure
was actually gonna happen

with the accountants in Australia.

I think, for look,
I should probably carry these in.

Okay. Can you do it?

I'm thinking that you probably shouldn't
be associated with the hamburgers.

Okay.

I'd like to thank everybody for coming.

You have many education choices,
and we're all grateful at the WTO

that you have chosen
to listen to us for an hour

and to our messages about things
that will impact everyone.

I'd like to say that,
by joining us here,

you're essentially embarking
with us on a mission.

I'd like to start right at the beginning.

As I was saying,

trade liberalization is a project of faith;
it's a crusade.

And in any crusade,
there are problems.

There are invading armies,
there are big blockades.

And one of the problems
that we run into in this crusade

is starvation in the Third World.

You may recognize that symbol
from those green bins you see...

where cans, bottles, blah, blah.

The kind of recycling I'm talking about
that we have developed at the WTO

is...not--not really
this irrelevant kind of recycling

where the target--
individual consumers like you and me

or of non-edible industrial products--
is such a tiny part of the problem.

Rather, we're talking about really
recycling what counts where it counts.

To begin to understand
the theory behind this,

you must first realize that the human body
is not really very efficient.

When ingesting heavy foods,
only about 20% of the nutrients

are absorbed
by the alimentary passageway

while the other 80% finds itself
expelled in post-consumer byproducts.

Already 20 years ago,

NASA scientists began
to tap into this nutritional gold mine

by developing filters that could
transform their astronauts' waste

into healthy, hygienic,
and even delicious food once again.

With the use of this technology,

a single hamburger, for example,
can be eaten more than ten times,

providing a cumulative total
of three times the nutritional value

of the original fresh hamburger.

Now, again, a certain amount
of cultural openness is required

as we investigate solutions.

And I'd love to take any questions.

Yes, you've been--

Coming from a Third World country,

I found most of what you said
pretty offensive.

It's as if everyone is equal,
but some are more equal than others.

And...who is to say

whether people in the Third World
want a burger?

You know, I, in my heart,
sometimes find it to agree

that cultures deserve
an equal consideration

perhaps to develop on their own terms,

but we're different.

We're culturally different.
We're rich, they're poor.

This is the most humane solution
we can come up with

that stays within the market logic.

If it's all right, I could answer
a portion of that question, as well.

And this answers the question
about desire for the product

because the biggest growth areas
are the developing world.

And so, in fact,
people do want the product.

We do have a kind of video presentation
about this that I came prepared to show.

It's not--the program isn't actually
completely ready yet.

So, as you can see here,
there's a consumer in the First World

entering McDonald's
and consuming a hamburger.

And, afterward, this is the process
we're all familiar with.

I don't need
to explain it to anyone.

But...

You see, it's rendered out
in this style

because studies have shown
that consumers are most responsive

to 3-D animation right now,
particularly in developing cultures.

So, as you can see,
it goes through a piping system,

and this isn't unusual.

We do this for oil.
We could do this for food, as well.

And, as you can see,
it goes back up through the plumbing...

and emerges in a McDonald's.

Now, the part of this video that isn't
completed yet is the filtering process.

There will be
a very well-rendered filtering...

As you can see--this might answer
somebody's question from before,

but at the McDonald's
in a developing country

and, in fact,
in this country as well,

you would be able to choose--
the number one, number two,

number three,
number four, number five

would no longer refer
to combinations of food,

but rather just the number of times
the product had been recycled.

We're lucky to be able to partner with
the World Trade Organization which,

you know, has slightly different goals.

Of course, McDonald's goals
are to profit and grow,

and we hope that we can provide

a nutritious and tasty product
in the process.

Our goals are to help McDonald's profit
and grow, and all other corporations.

I think you guys--
like, the WTO--

is kind of lacking kind of, like,
a human element, you know?

Like...if you saw--
have you ever seen starving people?

In pictures. Yes.

So, tell me, if you saw
somebody starving to death,

you would probably think a lot--

like, that would kind of hit you
in a sensitive place to say,

"Oh, maybe markets and money
and this and that don't really mean as much,

and, actually, feeding people
means a little bit more."

Well, it is true that there's
a personal side of it that--

I have to say, in the WTO

there are questions that we have
about this as human beings,

but we're not as subject--

we have a kind
of firmer grasp on theory.

We are able, fortunately,

to simply direct world trade
in a much more theoretical way...

in collaboration with our colleagues
at the largest corporations.

So...you know. Yes, probably,
if I went to these countries,

I'd feel...l'd think about things
a little differently, perhaps.

But, at the same time, I don't think
I would forget all my schooling.

I don't think I would forget
all these theories and so on.

So, perhaps one day I'll do that.

This is a money-maker, correct?

Yes. Well, it's a money-maker,
starvation-solver, sure.

How much did McDonald's pay you to
come here and speak this garbage to us?

Did I see a mouse with an ear
growing out of its back?

How are you going to get around
the cultural and legal implications

of cannibalism and basically
asking us to recycle shit?

The reality is that we already
treat people in the Third World

far worse than we treat
our domestic animals.

That's--that's not saying it's right.
It's just saying that's the reality.

Well, after thinking about it
for a little while,

it seems the Plattsburgh lecture
just went great,

and it went exactly the way we
originally expected these lectures to work,

which is that, at a certain point,
it was like a light bulb's going off

in the heads of the different people
in the audience,

and they were realizing that it
was just too crazy to be real,

and yet it was
sort of based in reality.

So, you know,
they started throwing globes at us,

they got angry,
they got frustrated.

It worked exactly
like we thought it would.

They don't ask if you believe in it.

You don't get to vote
on World Trade Organization treaties.

They don't let you vote on it.
They don't give you a say.

They let you listen
to the one-sided propaganda.

Name me a single columnist in America
who doesn't stand up and cheer

under the banner
of so-called free trade.

There's no public discussion,

there's no dissent
in any of the political parties.

There's no debate,
there's no discussion, there's no vote.

In fact, the only nation
which has called for a vote is Brazil,

which is saying that it
will not sign any more trade treaties

without a plebiscite of its people.

And the world trade barons
are losing their damn minds

trying to prevent this type of democracy
from spreading planet-wide,

'cause once people know what this stuff
is about and get to vote on it,

no one's gonna vote themselves
into poverty.

Here we go.
"Australia country code."

Australia, 61.
It's 61.

Sixty-one.

Hi, this is Kinnithrung Sprat
from the WTO.

<i>Hello. how are you?</i>
Good, thanks. How are you?

<i>- Where are you now?</i>
I'm in New York at the moment.

<i>- In New York, are you?</i>
Yes.

Kinnithrung Sprat just called the person
who's coordinating Sprat's visit.

I'm due in Hong Kong
the week after this,

and that date is firm,

but my travel to Australia
is as yet not firm. Yeah.

She's actually, it turns out,
been e-mailing all these people

and basically calling journalists

and getting people
to attend his lecture.

She fully expects him to attend because
she had spoken to Hildegard West,

Sprat's assistant,
and Hildegard West had told her

that everything was on
and Sprat was definitely going.

So now we've just decided
we really have to go

to honor this arrangement
with Australia.

So it's back on now
after we totally thought it was off.

And instead of giving this lecture that
we've been planning for, like, nine months,

we're gonna, like, you know,
just disband the WTO.

Shouldn't we get you a pair of shoes
that actually are reasonable?

They just don't look like dress shoes.
They look like wrestling shoes.

There are no shoes here
for you. Never mind.

No. Shoes are out.

A tie.

Around, then...

Wait--did you try this?

Yeah.

I did a set of these with inkjet,
and they just don't look as real.

Something about them.
They look...

These look perfect.
...kind of handmade.

I printed off some letterhead for you.

Nice.
You guys already saw that.

And I just kept it real simple...
It's perfect.

...so that it would show up well
on the fax.

That is the most ridiculous photo.

There's something really weird
about this maniacal public relations guy.

A little magnetic strip on the back.
A logo of the WTO.

Really beautiful.

You know what I did?
I went to Google...

and I went to Google image search
and I typed in, "I.D. card."

And you wouldn't believe
the number of pictures of I.D. cards

that show up on the Web.

And I just went through
and took a little bit from each one.

I said, "All right, this one's got
a little bar code at the bottom,

and this one uses
the logo over here."

That is so nice.

I know.
Wow. Airplane.

Where's the rental car area?

No, I don't know.
I'm just really nervous

'cause this feels different from all
the other things that we've done.

It's not like the same kind of play,
fun, crazy, weird, impossible stuff.

This is sincere, you know.

It's about replacing the WTO
with something better.

Do you think that satire is more fun?
Yeah, definitely.

I got this feeling that it's--
for some reason--

maybe it's less fun to be sincere.

But it is less fun, isn't it?

In a way, yeah.

Maybe it's more fun
to be satirical than serious.

Yeah.

It's about 9:00 in the morning,

and this is the big day
for Kinnithrung Sprat

to go talk to CPA Australia

and close down the WTO.

It's kind of an exciting day for us
'cause we finally get to shut it down.

I'm writing the local phone number
for this cell phone on the business cards.

So if we give these to journalists
or anybody else

who wants to contact Mr. Sprat--they'll be
able to do it in the next couple days.

We have to leave
in ten minutes, though.

I know.

I'm just gonna do
as little as possible.

Okay, let's just go by there.
We have some time yet.

Let's just keep walking.
Just walk straight.

Don't look.
Don't turn left. Don't...

Hey, no. Don't.
Don't do that.

Answer it.

Hello, Michael Bonanno here.

Hi, Jane. How are you?

All right, then. I guess
we'll see you in just a few minutes.

And we just come up
to level three, then?

Great. Thank you very much.
All right. Bye-bye.

Run!

Oh, wait. Shit!
This is the building!

Thank you for coming.
Thank you for having us.

Sorry for the confusion
and problems and everything else.

It's to be expected
these days, I think.

No. Thanks for going out of your way
to arrange this. This is really terrific.

Thank you all for coming.
I'd like to...

I'd like to thank the organizers
for going out of their way

to create this panel,
this luncheon,

in the face of some odds--the conference
having been canceled, of course.

And I'd especially like to begin

by apologizing for a rather sudden
change in the program,

consequent upon a rather dramatic
development in Geneva yesterday.

I originally intended to transmit today
an upbeat report

on some new technologies that affect
agribusiness in a global sense.

Instead, I find myself the messenger
of some rather disturbing news.

The WTO will be issuing
a public statement

in detail by the end of the week.

But the die has been cast.

As of September 2002,

having seen the effects of policies

whose only intent was to bring
greater prosperity and peace,

the World Trade Organization,
in its present form, will cease to exist.

Over the next two years,

we at the WTO will endeavor to re-found
our organization along different lines,

based in a different understanding
of the purposes of world trade.

The new organization will have
as its foundation and basis

the United Nations'
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

upon which we feel
we can make a good foundation

to ensuring that the organization
will have human

rather than business interests
as its bottom line.

My reaction was one of total surprise.

We were expecting
a speech more based

on what the World Trade Organization
does in its relation to Australian trade.

It sort of blew me out of the water
when the announcement was made

that the World Trade Organization
is significantly reinventing itself

to focus on issues relating to people
as opposed to economics--

something that hopefully could be
of significant benefit

to the poor and needy throughout
the world in all developing countries.

The U.N. estimates that poor countries--
the poorest countries in the world--

lose approximately $2 billion a day
because of unjust trade rules,

many of them instituted
by our own organization.

And this is 14 times the amount

that they receive in aid
from developed countries.

I thought the speech itself was compelling
in terms of its information.

I was astounded to find that they're
actually gonna dismantle the WTO.

I was also amazed to see that there was
a mission that perhaps had failed.

It's gonna have a huge effect
on international business

and particularly for us
as an organization, I feel.

The hardest thing, I find,
will be the balance that, let's say,

the U.S., E.U., and Japan--

in terms of being major components
of the world economy--

the effect--will they really change
in terms of this new organization,

and will there actually
be genuine change

and perhaps a benefit
to the world's poorest countries?

I must admit I'm a cynic
with regards to that occurring.

Liberalization--
the process of liberalization

often enables
the knowledge of the poor

to be converted into the property
of global corporations.

Specific statistics are rather shocking.

Out of 26,000 patents
applied for in Africa in 2000 and 2001,

only 31 were from residents of Africa.

The rest were from residents
of first world countries.

31 out of 26,000 patent applications.

It wasn't what I was expecting.

I was expecting something
on agribusiness

and what
the World Trade Organization does.

But I'd have to say
I believe it's fairly positive

because I think that,
as the gentleman said,

the strong are getting stronger,
and the weak are getting weaker.

And you can't let that keep on going.

Even we notice it here in Australia

with some of the trade arrangements
that are made.

If you're powerful,
you can get whatever you like,

and if you're not, you can't.

The world, with the population we've got,
can't keep going that way.

So I think it was fairly positive,

and I think it's a very brave decision
by an organization

to admit that they've been going down
the wrong track and dissolve themselves

and start to look for something different.
And I think it's fantastic.

Disparity is growing
between rich and poor.

The richest fifth have 80%
of the world's income,

and the poorest fifth have 1%.

This gap--we all know this figure,

but we don't always remember that
this gap has actually doubled since 1960.

More and more thinkers
are therefore noting

that there is no evidence
that liberalization favors growth

or benefits the poor.

I think we're all generally aware
of increases in poverty

and low living standards and issues
faced by developing countries.

And what Mr. Sprat had to say today
really is a terrific sign of hope

for what I think we all aspire to,

and that's a global economy
that benefits all people.

Now, after protected, protracted,
and detailed review

of current trade policy,
the World Trade Organization has decided

to affect a cessation of all operations

to be accomplished
over the next four months

culminating by the end of September...

Well, I think that the Yes Men

have kind of played out their course

in relation to the World Trade
Organization for the moment.

You never know when we
might get another invitation.

We were lucky to be able to provide a sort
of sense of closure by ending the WTO.

We also hope that other people
will just start doing the same things

in all kinds of different contexts--

impersonating whoever holds power
that needs to be criticized.

So if the opportunity arises,
we're just gonna keep doing it.

We're gonna go and...
be the Yes Men again,

or I should say,
be the WTO again in another event.

The future's bright for the Yes Men.

The future of the world
is a different story.

No, this isn't the way
he usually dresses.

He works for the World Trade
Organization--you know, the WTO.

He works--
see, we're at a conference,

and he's demonstrating
a new kind of technology.

This is--well, it's a device
to measure employee working

in less developed countries.

There's a thing here where...

on this screen I can see...

See, he watches people working there.

And they have little devices
that give them shocks.

It's just regular fabric.

In the future,
it'll be sensitive-smart fabric.

It's a little hot, but...

That one looks better.
