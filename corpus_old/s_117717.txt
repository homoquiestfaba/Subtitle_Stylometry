All forgotten... yesterdays

School days remind me of

When I was a boy

All my life

I've been this lonely boy

Doo doo

The gate!

What do you want?

Can I use the bathroom here?
I can't let you back in here.

This is the discharge gate.

Hey, there's the last bus
into town tonight.

You better get on it.

Excuse me. You know where
the bathroom is?

Yeah, it's down there.

The bathroom's closed, sir.
It's closed! Thanks.

Excuse me, miss?

Do you know where there's a bathroom?
It's back there.

That's closed.
Do you know another bathroom?

There's one in the restaurant,
up there.

Okay, thanks. Thank you.
Down there.

Fuck, man.

Restaurant is closed.

Restaurant is closed.
Can I use the bathroom?

Bathroom is closed, too.
I said, the restaurant is closed.

Watch your mouth.

Why don't you watch

Smart-ass!

Hey, miss. Miss!

You got a quarter I can borrow?
Yes.

Can I borrow it?
Yeah.

Can I borrow it now?

Don't you say, "Thanks"?
What?

Don't you say, "Thank you"?
What?

Hello, Ma?

It's me.
It's Billy.

Billy.

Billy, your son!
Turn down the TV, Ma.

Turn down the television!

It's Billy.

I told you we were gonna be
in town for one day, right?

Well, we're in town.
We just flew in.

We're at
the fancy hotel, Ma.

I told you we were
staying downtown. Yes.

The big hotel. Right.

Yeah, I have a big room.
Yes, it's beautiful here.

Yes, it's clean, Ma.

It's a very expensive hotel,
okay?

No, don't come here, Ma.
Don't come here.

I told you
I wanna go there.

I wanna see
the old neighborhood.

I wanna come now.

What time is the game over, Ma?

Fine.

I'll come at 5:00.

No, Ma. She's not coming.
She's sick.

I don't know, Ma.

People get sick.
I don't know why she's sick.

She's sick. Every time we fly
on planes, she gets sick.

I don't know why.

She doesn't like flying.
Plus, we sit in first class.

They bring you a lot of food,
and she always gets stomach cramps.

I don't know.

I ca...
She's sleeping, Ma.

I'm in the lobby
of the hotel.

She's sleeping upstairs.
I'm not gonna wake her up.

Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?

What did I say?
What did I say? She's sick!

Fine, Ma.
You want me to wake her up?

You want me to go upstairs and wake
her up? You know, you're unbelievable.

Then how you gonna feel
when she comes over sick?

How you gonna feel then,
when you see how sick she is?

No, I'm gonna bring her.

I'm gonna drag her outta bed,
and I'm gonna bring her.

So you can see her.
Fine. We're coming over.

We're coming over.

I said I'm bringing her.
Yes. Fine.

Okay? Good-bye.

Excuse me, miss?

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

Shut up, shut up.

Don't you scream,
or I'll take a bite outta your face.

All right?
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

Shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

Come on.
Come on.

Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

And again. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

Shut your mouth,
and you'll be okay.

Point your car out.

Give me your fuckin' purse.

Just shut up.
Shut up!

Ow. You're hurting me.
Yeah? Shut your mouth, or I'll really hurt you.

Wanna really get hurt?
Get in the car.

Get in. Hurry up!

Get in the car.

How do I get
this thing back?

Point to the thing!
It's right there.

All right.

I can't see
out the window.

Give me something
to wipe the window with.

Give me something
to wipe the window with!

Okay, no, you go out.
You clean it.

Get outta the car
and clean this window.

Don't you ever clean
your window?

Do you ever think
about cleaning your car?

I don't got all day.
Hurry up!

See how you wash
your car?

You see how nice,
when a car's clean?

Come here. Is that how
your house is, filthy like that?

You see how nice the car is
when it's clean?

Now you can see.
That's good.

That's good. Get in your car.
Come on. Hurry up.

Hurry up!
Stop!

You shut your mouth!
Shut your mouth.

Filthy.
Filthy.

All right.
Where's the thing on this car?

How do you put it in gear? Where's the thing?
It's right here.

What is this?
Is this a shifter car?

I cannot drive
a shifter car.

So we got
a situation here.

I can't drive these kinda cars.
What the fuck is goin' on?

You think that's funny?
Would you like to know, smart-ass?

Would you like to know why
I can't drive this kinda car?

I'm used to luxury cars.

Have you ever heard
of a luxury car?

Ever heard of Cadillac, Cadillac
Eldorado? That's what I drive.

I drive cars
that shift themselves.

My cars shift themselves.
The luxury cars, they shift themselves.

So when I say, "Three",
you follow my count.

You come around to my door,
got me?

One, two, three.

What'd I just say?
One, two, three.

Get outta the car.
Get outta the car.

I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.

I'm watching you, and don't make
that face. Don't make that face.

Hurry up!

Now, pull away.

Go this way. Hey, go this way!
This way!

I want you to pull over up there.
Where?

Pull over here!
Right here. That's it.

That's good. That's it.
Beautiful.

Put the car in park,
all right?

I'm gonna step outta
the car for one minute.

Put your hands
on the dashboard.

Hold them like that.

Don't let me see
you move one finger.

Not one twitch or I'll come back.
I'll choke you to death.

I'll take a bite outta your cheek,
and I'll shit you out.

So just hold your hands
like that.

You understand me?
Nod your head if you understand.

You understand?
Yes. Yes. You understand.

All right.
Stay right there.

Oh.

Don't look.

Oh.

Who told you to look?

Oh. Oh!

Oh!

Take your hands
off the dash.

You're makin' me nervous.

First thing.
Right off the bat.

I'd like to apologize.

All right?
I'm gonna apologize.

I've had to go to the bathroom
for hours. I've been backed up.

Totally backed up.

Anyway, I swear to God,
I didn't mean to scare you.

I'm sorry if I pulled your hair,
all right?

You okay, huh?
Good.

All right. Now don't talk,
all right? Please.

I need to ask you
a favor.

I haven't seen my parents
in a long time, right?

'Cause I just got out
of jail.

I was innocent.

Okay. Before I went away,
I made up a few lies.

I said I was married. I also told them
I worked for the government...

and that I would be away
for a long time.

Now, what I need you to do,
is I need you to come...

to my parent's house
with me, all right?

And pretend
to be my wife.

Acting, all right?
Today's your big debut. Your big break.

This is acting, all right?
You're my wife.

So, that means you adore me,
you love me, you cherish me.

Jesus Christ,
you can't live without me.

Now, the story will go
like this.

We met in high school,
and, uh,

we were sweethearts,
whatever.

You loved me. You've been
in love with me your whole life.

Your new name would be
Wendy Balsam.

All right?
Don't worry about the details.

I'll take over.
Just be nice.

When you get there,
be a decent girl. Be nice.

Um, what's your name?
What's your real name?

Layla.
Layla. No. That's no good.

We'll stick with Wendy Balsam,
okay? You're Wendy Balsam.

So, basically,
what I'm asking you to do,

is I'm asking you
to come there...

and make me look good,
all right?

If you make
a fool outta me,

I swear to God,
I'll kill you right there.

Boom. Right in front
of Mommy and Daddy.

I'll tell you something else.
If you make me look bad,

I will never, ever,
talk to you again.

Ever.

But if you do a good job,
well, then you could be my best friend.

My best friend
that I've ever had.

Hear me?

All right.
Let's keep driving.

All right? We're gonna go.
Keep driving.

What's your name?

My name is Billy.

Billy Brown.

Just remember
why you're there.

You're there to make me look good.
You hear me?

You can eat all the food you want,
but just make me look good.

Okay? Why are you there?
To make you look good.

That's right.
To make me look good.

Then you can go home.
Okay.

Are your parents
vegetarians?

I hope so, 'cause
I don't eat meat.

Ever.

Come on.
Come on.

Which house is it?
It's there.

All right, all right!

Ohh! Ohh!
Oh, goddamn it. Ohh!

Oh, honey, did you see that?
Oh. Oh, man.

Did you see that?

Oh, I can't believe it.

Are you okay?

What'd I tell you?
All right?

Just make sure
you behave right.

Come on.
Come on!

What'd I tell you?
Come on.

Don't start.
All right. Just come on.

Do me this favor, all right?
I will.

This is not,
uh, nice, okay?

Just be nice, okay?
Be nice.

Say hello,
really nice hellos.

My father likes when people say hello.
Okay.

Okay. Hello, Mr. Brown.
Okay, please.

Okay.

Are you sure you're okay?

I feel sick.

I feel like throwing up.

Would you hold me a second?
Tackle him!

Tackle him!
Would you hold me?

Tackle him!
Don't touch me.

I can't believe you!
Don't touch me.

You're so pathetic!
Come on. Come on.

Get off the street. Get off the street!
Come on.

All right, all right!

Get him! Run, run!

Hello!

You, you, you, you, you! Whew!

Hey, Dad.

Jan, it's your son.

Who?

I said, it's your son.

Oh, honey.

It's Billy.
Billy's here.

So, we're so happy to meet you, honey.

Billy's told us
so much about you.

Oh, well, I've heard so much
about both of you.

He's very proud
of you two.

Do you think I could use
your bathroom?

Sure, honey. Billy, go show her
where the bathroom is.

It's down the hall.
Don't take a long time.

I have to go
to the bathroom.

Just hurry up.

So, honey. You look tired.
Are you sick?

No, I'm not sick, Ma.

Why?

Well, you just...
look so tired.

I am a little tired.
I just flew on a plane. Okay?

All right, honey.
Don't get upset.

I'm not upset.
All right.

You want something to drink?
Yeah.

All right. What do you want
to drink, honey?

I'd like a glass
of water, please.

Honey, you don't want
some pop?

You know
I don't drink pop, Ma.

The bubbles bother
my stomach.

Would you like some ginger ale, honey?
I got some ginger ale.

That's good for the stomach.
Yeah.

Ginger ale is pop, Ma.

Ginger ale is pop.
I just said I don't want pop.

Can I please have
a glass of water?

Oh, how about
I make you the juice?

I got the frozen juice.

I just want a glass
of water, please. Okay?

Just a glass of water.
That's all I want.

All right.
Okay? Thank you.

Oh, honey, I got those
chocolate doughnuts you like.

You want one now?

You think it'll spoil
your appetite?

It won't spoil my appetite, Ma.
I don't eat chocolate.

I'm allergic to it,
remember?

Honey, what are you talking about,
you don't eat chocolate?

You always ate chocolate.

That's great, Ma.
That's great.

You don't remember
your own son. Great.

Ma, my face is itchy.
I'm allergic to chocolate.

When I eat chocolate,
my face blows up.

Honey, what happened
to your face?

It's all swollen.
You better put some ice on that.

When I ate chocolate as a kid,

you had to take me to the emergency
room, because my face swelled up.

Honey, I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

You always ate chocolate.

I didn't eat chocolate, Ma.

I did not always eat chocolate, okay?
I didn't eat chocolate!

Can we talk about
something else?

All right. Just calm down.
Fine.

Hi.
Hi, honey.

Wood can still go.

That has come on in the last few years.
He's one of the best.

First and ten, Buffalo.

Why don't you get her
something to drink, Ma?

Ooh! All right.
You want something to drink, honey?

Yeah, could you make me
a rum and Coke?

What, honey?

I meant, could I have
a ginger ale?

Oh, sure, we got
a ginger ale. Hold on.

Come here, honey.
Let me hug my new little daughter.

Daddy loves you, you know that?
Daddy really loves you.

His new, little,
sweet, young daughter.

Sit down, honey.

I'm 28.

Oh, honey.
You look like a baby.

You look so young and pretty.
Thank you.

My son used to be
a beautiful baby.

Oh, you should have seen him.
He was so beautiful.

Look at him now.

Oh, no.

I think Billy is the most handsome guy
in the whole world.

Who, honey?
Billy.

I think he's the most handsome man
I've ever seen.

Billy, who?
This Billy.

Oh? Aah.

I can't stand it
when he grows his hair long.

Mrs. Brown, could I see some pictures
of Billy from when he was little?

You wanna see pictures?
Sure.

Honey, where's
the Billy picture?

I don't know.
You know.

The picture of Billy, honey.

I don't know where it is.
Uh, wait a minute.

We got some pictures, here.

You don't want to forget
how tough it was for Buffalo.

Here's a picture
of me with Jack Kemp.

Here's O.J. Simpson.

Here's me with
the Buffalo Bills' caterer.

Oh, here's my husband.

Here's our wedding.

Honey, did you find it?

Yeah, I found it.

Oh, look at Billy.

Oh, he's so cute.

Oh, and the puppy. That puppy's
adorable. Whose puppy is that?

That was Billy's.
Bingo.

What happened to him?

I don't know
what happened to him.

Um, he ran away.
Yeah, he ran away.

Such a cute puppy.

Billy!

What did I tell you
about this thing?

Didn't I warn you
about this dog?

Didn't I tell you if it peed
in the house again, what I'd do?

No, Daddy, please, no!
Didn't I tell you what I'd do?

No, Daddy, please!

That's enough with the pictures.
I'm hungry.

Jan, would you
hurry it up, please?

Oh, who's this handsome guy
in this picture?

Oh.
That's me. I was a singer.

That's me in a downtown nightclub
with this band.

You know,
Sinatra sang in that club.

He sang
in that actual club.

Wow, you're a singer?

Well, I was a singer.
Yeah.

Did you ever make
any records?

I mean, do you have any tapes?
No, no, no.

Well, a few tapes, yeah.

Can I hear one?
You wanna hear one of my tapes?

All right. As soon as we eat,
I'll play you a tape.

Honey, it's gonna be 20 minutes
before I'm done with dinner.

Why don't you play her
the tapes now?

You really want to hear this?
Yes.

Okay. Follow me.

Wood's kick is up,
and, of course, it's good.

Now, these are some arrangements
Nelson Riddle made...

for Frank, you know,
without Frank's voice, of course,

so he could listen to them, see what
he liked, what he didn't like.

I like to sing to them.

So, let me find
the hole here.

I hope I can still get up there.

Hut, hut.

Fools rush in!

Where angels fear
to tread!

And so I come to you
my love!

My heart
above my head!

Though I see!

The danger there!

If there's
a chance for me!

Then I don't care!

Fools rush in!

Where wise men
never go!

But wise men
never fall in love!

So how are they
to know!

When we met!

I felt
my life begin!

So open up
your heart and let!

This fool rush in!

So, we have Buffalo take the fall...

after being stuck by a 58-yard
touchdown pass from Hassle to Navarro.

I felt
my life begin!

So, open up your heart
and let!

This fool rush in!

Well, that's enough
of that shit.

Your voice
is so beautiful.

Yeah, well.
Let's go and eat.

Can I hear one more?
No, I'm hungry.

I'm shaking without dinner.
Let's go.

Please, just one more song.
No more! Okay?

I'm sorry, honey.
Jesus Christ.

Hey, listen,
when we finish eating,

I'll look around,
find a tape for you.

You take it home,
play it anytime you want, okay?

Okay.
'Cause Daddy loves you, you know that.

I love you.
Let's go.

They have four linebackers,
and the rest are defensive backs.

It'll make Buffalo think about
keeping the ball in the air.

It's a challenge.

They're trying to say,
if you're going to go anywhere,

you're gonna have
to throw it in the air.

Billy, you're right.

Your father does have
the most beautiful voice.

Careful, everybody. It's very hot.

Hope you like tripe.

Oh, actually,
I don't know what that is.

Well, the Italians
call it trippa.

It's the intestines of the cow,
and it's very good for you.

It's terrific. Isn't that what
you said was your favorite food?

Go ahead, honey.
Go ahead.

Tell me what you think.
Go ahead, Wendy. Take a big bite.

Go ahead. Take a big,
bigger bite. Mmm.

That a girl.
There you go. Bring more, Ma.

She's going to eat a lot.
I sense it.

Well, everybody
gets the same.

Turn that knife away from me, please.

Why are you pointing that knife at me?
That why you came,

to stab me with
that knife, huh?

Will you turn it away
from me, please?

Honey, calm down.
Turn it away, please!

What, what?
The knife is not pointed at you!

It's pointed at me!
Honey!

Don't tell me you didn't point the knife at me.
I did not.

Don't point a knife at a person
unless you wanna use it!

I didn't point the knife at you!
It was here!

On the table, like that!
It was not here!

Point it over here. Over here.
Fine. Fine.

Honey, calm down,
all right?

I am calm.
All right. She's talking, all right?

Did you see what your son did?
I didn't do nothin'.

He pointed a knife at his father.
Yeah, yeah.

I pointed it at you. It's always at you, Dad.
Honey, honey.

You want some more tripe, honey?
No, I don't want tripe.

You want to get me tripe?
Get me tripe.

No, listen, let him fill up
on the bread. Enough tripe.

Let me eat bread. That's what he wants me to eat.
That's your son.

Bread all the time,
right?

God forbid I should
have a piece of meat, right, Dad?

So, um, Wendy, honey.
You were saying?

I was just, um,
I was gonna say how Billy's the...

the nicest husband
in the whole world.

Oh, yeah, sure.
I'm sure he's terrific.

No, really.
I'm the luckiest girl...

to have found
such a wonderful husband.

I fell in love with him
the first time I met him.

Long-lasting Energizer
batteries keep going...

Honey, can you pass me
the remote control, there?

It's right behind you.

Still going. Long-lasting Energizer...

Did Billy ever tell you
how we met?

Oh, um, no, honey.
How did you two meet?

Billy, you didn't
tell your mom how we met?

You tell her.

Well. I was working
as a typist for the C.I.A.,

which is a special part
of the government.

And Billy is a top agent
with the C.I.A.

I'm sure you know that.
You're probably so proud of him.

Anyway, he has hundreds
of people working for him.

All the girls in the office
were always telling me...

how much they were
in love with their boss.

I had never seen him,
because I worked way down...

on the other side
of the building.

But one day, he comes
into the office, and I see him,

and I fell in love...
madly in love... with him.

But, you know, I couldn't talk to him,
because I was just a typist, and...

He's the kindest, smartest,
most handsome guy there.

I mean, even the guys loved him.
They idolized him.

So, I just,
I just couldn't.

I didn't think he'd ever like me.
I was just a typist girl.

And, you know,
he was like, the king.

I mean, even the president
is so proud of him.

So, one day...

I walk into my office,

and there's this giant
bouquet of roses.

I was just like, my God,
what are those flowers on my desk?

I thought maybe they had gotten
the wrong desk or something.

So, I go over
and I open the card.

There was
a little note attached.

And it said:
"Dear Wendy, I have been in love...

"with you for a year,
but I'm very shy.

"I didn't know how
to tell you before this.

"But I want you to know
that I really love you,

and I'd love to take you out
to dinner sometime. "

And guess who it was signed by?
Who?

Honey, honey, hold on. Watch this play, all right?
Billy.

It was signed by Billy.
It said, "Love, Billy. "

Uh-huh. Watch this play,
all right? Just watch this.

Linder will snap.

Wood tries
to kick his longest ever on grass.

No good!

Aah, goddamn it.
Goddamn it!

Thirty years,
I haven't missed a game.

They haven't won
the championship since 1966.

I missed that game,
'cause that's the day I had Billy.

Oh, I wish
I never had him.

I wouldn't have
missed that game.

Wow.

Did you like
Buffalo too?

Um, it's Billy Brown calling.

I'd like to bet
on the Super Bowl.

On Buffalo.

To win.

Right.

Um.

I'd like to put
10,000 on it.

Oh, $10,000!
Hold on one second.

That's too much, Billy!
You're gonna get in trouble!

Shut up.
I'm talking on the phone!

Come on, Scott.
Come on, Scott.

Wood tries
to kick his longest ever on grass.

No good! Wide right.
Oh, no. Fuck!

Told you. You're gonna be in trouble.

Shut up!
I told you.

I'm fucked.

You're dead.
I am fuckin' dead.

Okay, the story goes like this.

One day,
this big asshole comes in,

he calls up a bet.

$10,000 bet on Buffalo
to win the Super Bowl.

That's to win, okay?

Now, I know what
you're thinking.

The story's hard
to believe, right?

I mean, what kind
of an idiot would bet...

on Buffalo to win
a big game like that?

It's true,
I swear to God it happened.

I mean, this guy
was so out of touch...

he didn't even have the ten large
to cover his bet.

Hey, tell somebody
to turn up the heat.

So, Billy.

What happened was this bookie
got so sick...

of hearing everybody's excuses.

I mean, they're all the same,
you know?

Everybody's got an excuse.

Anyway, this bookie got so sick
that he just had to throw up.

The only way he could make himself feel
better was to... to do bad things.

To do very,
very bad things to the excuse maker.

And very, very bad things to the
excuse maker's mother and father.

So, what do you say?

Why don't we give this story
a happy ending?

I got an acquaintance,
a friend,

a very good friend of ours,
and he just got arrested.

Of course, he's innocent.

His arrest is
a goddamn injustice, a tragedy.

So, you, the asshole,

will confess to the crime
of which he is accused,

so as to free
the innocent man.

Now, if you fail...

to convince the court,

or if you refuse
to try to,

then very evil and very bad things
are gonna happen.

Very evil
and very bad things.

Oh, and, Billy.

If Buffalo ever makes it back
to the Super Bowl,

bet against them.

Now, get the fuck
out of my sight.

All rise.

Mr. Brown,
based on your confession,

you are found guilty
as charged.

Therefore, it is the judgment
of this court...

that you are sentenced
to the maximum term.

Five years. No parole.

This one is going to go in June.

See how I've
been doing it?

I write on every envelope.
You don't have to think, Goon.

This goes in June.

Any day in June.

Any day in June.
All you have to look at...

is the thing,
like all the other ones.

You look at the month.
Goon, Goon, pay attention.

We're almost done.
We're almost done.

This one says June.
They all have a month marked.

This one goes June. June comes
before July, and after May.

So anytime you hear
that it's June,

just put this in the mailbox,
all right?

Can I trust you on these?
Are we done with these?

Got it?
They all got their own month.

Any day of the month, you could send it.
You know the month,

because it's written
on the back.

This one goes
at Christmastime.

Please, please, don't pick
your nose in front of me.

Please don't do that,
all right?

This goes at Christmastime.

Christmas.
Do you know when Christmas is?

I know when Christmas is, Billy.
You do?

You know Rudolph is on TV?
You think I'm dumb?

Yeah, I think you're
a little dumb sometimes.

Cut it out, Billy,
or I'm not going to do it.

Yeah, right.
Just listen to me.

You wanna know
what I heard in here?

You know Scott Wood?

I heard from guys in here
who know for a fact, okay.

They know for a fact that he missed
that fuckin' field goal on purpose.

That he got paid money
and he missed it on purpose, okay?

That motherfuck. That motherfuck.
I wonder how much.

I wonder how much that motherfuck
got paid to ruin my fuckin' life.

Okay?
I'll tell you what.

I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do. Listen.

When I get out of here,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

I swear to God,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

That motherfuckin',
ten-cent field goal kicker.

I'm gonna kill him.
I'll tell you something.

I'll kill myself too,
'cause I don't give a fuck,

'cause I'm not coming
back here, understand?

You understand?
So just remember what I told you.

What are you lookin' at?

What are you lookin' at?

You got this, right?
You got this, and this.

When is this one going?
This one is going in January.

This is for my mother's birthday.
All right? January.

Let me write it down
on every package, okay?

January. Goon, please, please,
please, don't fuck me here.

Please, be a person
this time.

Could I use the phone
in the bedroom?

Sure, honey.
Where are you calling, a local call?

Yes, a local call.
Okay.

Hey, Goon. It's me, Billy.
What are you doing?

Billy, I don't want people
to call me that no more.

Even you.

Hello to you too.
Uh, why, what?

What do they
call you now?

What do you want them
to call you?

Um, my new name
is Rocky.

Um, your name is Rocky,
huh?

My new name is Rocky!

Rocky, I go away
for two seconds,

and you change your name
from Goon to Rocky, huh?

Whatever, all right. Whatever you want.

Whatever you want.
Listen.

Um, I just got out
of jail, and, uh,

you remember
that guy, Wood?

I'd really like
to find him.

Billy, you going, you still going
to do that bad thing...

you said you were
going to do?

Don't, don't you think
that's not a good thing to do?

What if the policeman
catches you?

Yeah, well, I'm not going
to get caught, okay?

I'm not going
to get caught.

You want to help me or
you don't want to help me, huh?

Well, he's got the TV commercial
and he's got that club...

where the girls
take off their clothes.

What? The guy opens up
a strip joint in Buffalo?

Billy, you wanna come
over to my house?

You wanna come over
for dinner?

My mom's makin'...
she's cookin' dinner.

What's... What's the name
of the club? Hey, Goon.

Huh?
What's the name of the joint?

Oh, it's this...
It's the name of his name.

It's got his name.
It's named, yeah.

You know a street?
You know anything? Can you help me?

Could you give me
a street name?

You're confusing me.
I don't know.

I don't remember.
You shouldn't go down there.

Don't go down there.

I have a little surprise
that, um,

I haven't told Billy yet.
Oh, yeah?

I'm pregnant. We're gonna have a baby.
Oh!

Wendy, honey,
you're gonna have a baby!

You're gonna have a baby!
Don't tell Billy.

I want to
surprise him later.

We won't say nothin'.
That's terrific.

Come here and give me
a hug! Yeah!

I won't say nothin'.

See, Goon,
I'm just kidding. All right?

I'm just kidding.

I just want to go
and say hello to him.

Can you help me find him,
yes or no?

I know how you get.

Don't, you're going
to go back to jail.

What'd I say?
I said I was kidding.

You got a phone book
in the house?

Don't do bad things.

Just don't do
any bad things.

Did you get
the raisins I sent you?

Yeah, Goon,
I got the raisins. Thanks.

Do you have a phone book?
Can you help me out?

Can you
help me out here?

Don't call me that.
I don't like that name no more.

All right. All right. Rocky, Rocky,
Rocky! Okay, I'll call you Rocky.

You happy, big shot?
You happy, Rocky?

What's the difference
what your name is?

Would you do me a favor,
and get a phone book?

Billy, I got to go.
My mom's calling me.

She's mad that I'm
on the phone too long.

You know something, Goon?
You know what you are?

You know your problem?
Your problem is your mother.

Because you know what?
That's all you do.

You run when your mom calls you
all the time.

Can you just get
a phone book?

No, I gotta go. My mom said I gotta go.
I need you for one second.

Get a phone book.
Don't be sore at me like that, Billy.

I just need you
to get a phone book!

Every time your mother says
something, that's how you...

That's why people
call you Goon.

Do you know why
they call you Goon?

Because you're retarded.
And you're ugly. You're an ugly retard.

And they call you Goon because
you're ugly and retarded.

And you'll always
be Goon.

Goon, Goon, Goon. And that's
what I'm going to call you...

for the rest of your life,
is Goon.

Goon, Goon, Goon, Goon. Okay?
So fuck you.

Fuck.

Oh, honey.
You're gonna have a baby!

Well, it's really been
a pleasure having you here.

And when you have
a little one,

I want you to call it
little Jimmy!

Honey, we love you
so much, honey.

You come back soon,
all right?

You guys have to come visit us too.
The house is so beautiful.

Billy's so handy.
He's built so many amazing things.

Yeah, well, now you have
another house, huh?

And I want you to give your daddy
a big kiss. Come on.

Oh, honey,
we love you so much.

You come back and visit soon, all right?
We will.

All right?
We will. Bye.

Bye, honey.

Ho, ho, ho, go! Come on!

Can't believe them!

No, Billy, it's good.
It's good if they like me.

Then, they'll be proud of you.

Bullshit! My life is shit.

If you were my son, I'd be proud of you.

Did you see them
kiss your ass? You made it happen.

You made them do that.

You kidnapped me.
You pulled my hair. You threatened me.

I just went in there
and did you a favor.

I thought I did a good job...
What was that shit about the C.I.A.?

I asked you nice. I said nice.

Make me look good!

What, C.I.A.?
You think my father believed that?

Do you think he believed that
for one second?

"Your son works with the C.I.A.
All the girls love him.

He's smart.
He's smart!"

Let's go.

Hey!

Hey, look, everybody.
The king is back!

Oh, that's right.
The king is here.

Billy Brown!
What's up?

Nice to see you, man.
Good to see you.

You look really good.
Really good. Really good.

So, you guys keep
my ball and stuff?

Did we keep your ball?

We got your ball,
your locker.

All right.
You better have kept it.

Just like you left it.
All right.

What?
You pay my membership?

Yeah.
Yeah.

You weren't here
to pay it,

so I paid it for you,
because I'm your friend, right?

All right.
You used your own money?

Yeah.
All right. I owe you for that.

Sure, you're my friend.
All right. You're my friend too.

So, any good bowlers around
these days? Anybody good?

Just you, Billy.
All right.

Um, who's the girl?

I'm his wife.
She's not my wife.

I picked her up hitchhiking.

Five years in the joint,
you don't waste any time, huh?

You know me, right?

I'm going to go get my things
out of the locker.

I'll give you 13.
That's the one you like, right?

Yeah, that's my lane.
All right, I'll see you in a minute.
