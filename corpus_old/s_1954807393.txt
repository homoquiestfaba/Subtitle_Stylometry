Hi. Did you miss me?

No. Not at all.

I'll take that as a compliment.

It's okay. You won't lose any
            data.

It's on somebody's cloud.

Oh my god.

Ah, control click the package.

The collections were tragic.

 We can only hope our customers

    are as color-blind as
        our designers.

It's hidden in the installer.

Hold on. That's my sitter, Jill.

Ya.

Hi Jill! How's Laila?

She didn't bite anyone did she?

    Uh-uh-hold on, this is
      my-my-assistant.

        Oh my God yeah.

The models were fat.

They said they were healthy, but
        they were fat.

Uh...you control click it.

 It's the key that says CTRL.
         It's on the-

Oh my God! That is
         disgusting!

A package is actually a folder.

Yeah, they do that to
      make it simple...

but it's always hard to explain
             it.

Oh my God. That is so cute. I
       can't stand it.

Wait a minute. Oh no.
Are you brushing your teeth!?

Do not say that
            again!

Hold on Luis, that's my sitter
 again. Hey, Jill what's up?

Well, the
  installer image is inside.

About 8 giga-

Okay. I can hear you.
Sorry.

Hi.

Wait, wait, wait. It's not on
          the cloud?

Oh boy. Okay, you need
     to back it up first.
You know I told
             you-

and I don't really want to
   talk about it...again.
Probably take three or
        four hours...

    you know...and...yeah,
        uh, do that--

I know she does. I know...

    but I'm a mom and moms
           worry...

...ugh, nothing. I'll see you in
            a bit.

How was fashion week?

Good.

Good.

Hiiii! Hi, Laila! Ohhhhhh.
You're so excited to see Mommy!

Oh, ho, ho! You missed
         Mommy, huh?

Oh, Caramel kisses,
    gimme caramel kisses!

Oh, poor girl. I missed you too.

Ah. We went to the park and the
  post office, the movies--

The movies?

It's freezing in there. Did you
     put her sweater on?

Yes, but she didn't like
          it so I--

Jill. She needs her
           sweater.

Isn't that what her fur is for?

Uhhh, Here ya go.

You know, it feels weird taking
         money for...

   hanging out with my BFF,
          maybe...

    I could just stay for
        dinner... or?

Uh...

Uh, Abby has a client dinner.

Oh. 'Kay.

I will see you tomorrow night.
         Bye Littles.

Her name is Laila.

She looks more like a Littles.

How long you been driving on
         that spare?

About a month. Bye!

House number two is a fixer
 upper just outside the city.

Oh, that place is disgusting.

Is that mold?

It's gotta be.

They're never gonna pick house
             two.

Mmm.

Terrible location.

Hey, Kat. What's up?

You guys want to grab
     a bite at Julio's?

    Two for one margaritas!

They don't allow dogs.

Okay. How about
       Chutney Palace?

Laila doesn't like Indian.

I think we're just  gonna stay
             in.

Bye, bitch!

Bye, bitch!

     Oh, I want that house.

You're squishing Laila.

Sorry.

Don't! She's tired.

Sorry.

Make some noise for fuck's sake!

Kent.

I love you so much.

So you're cool with
        being friends?

Wh--?

Wait. You're still breaking up
           with me?

Whoa. Whoa, whoa. We were
never officially together, so.

   And I mean if you think
          about it..

It's a good thing we didn't get
    too involved you know?

    Woulda been much harder.

But, you're on the lease.

I got a new lease.

Awww. You love these NON-GMO
  biscuits. Yeah. Good Girl.

Give mama your face
and wipe your mouffy. Good girl.

What are my girls up to today?

We're hittin' the
         doggy park.

    We're gonna see Bernie
the pug, and Oliver the Westie,

and Sage the Beagle, and their
           mommies.

You two. Need to make a baby.

We're not ready
          for that.

Bye.

Bob wants to see you in his
           office.

Mhmm

Mhmm.

             I uh--

I got you something.

 It's a USB coffee mug warmer.

You plug it into your USB port
           and it--

keeps it warm

Oh.

Mmmm, mmm, mmm.

Listen, Jill. Ahhh, it's been
           great...

  having you with us for the
       last few months.

Thank you so much,

I-I really enjoy working here
     everyone's just so,

so nice.

We're cutting back on our temps.

D-down-sizing, economy and all,
            uh...

 we're gonna have to let you
go. I'm sor-I'm so-I'm sorry.

But, this is where I work.

Well, not anymore.

They really love their dog.

They love that dog too much.
Jesus Christ.

Is that thing wearing
           a tutu?

Cute Christmas Card.

Kaaaaaat!!! What's up
           bitch!
What's up
            bitch!

I'm so glad you're here it's a
    snooze fest in there.

Good thing you didn't
       come to Julio's.

     I'm still shit faced.

Do you have any coconut water?

    Who-ooo. love the dress!

Thank you. I made it
out of a pair of Eliott's pants.

What?! If you don't create your
     own clothing line...

  you should be convicted of
   crimes against humanity.

You guys can put your
     shoes in the basket.

I know the rule, Eliott.

Wow. Rambo! What have you been
            doin'?

A little yoga.

Devon, this is Abby and her
       husband Eliott.

Hi. How ya doin'?

How's it goin' uh...? Where's
           the bar?

Uhhhhh, yeah it's over, yeah
       it's, follow me.

Oh my god, bitch.

That's what I'm talkin' about.

Wh -what happened to
       what's his name?

He found my driver's licence.

 I got this for you at Julio's.

Ew! I hate Sangria.

Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry I'm
            late.

     They had this worker
 appreciation thing for me.

You know, they gave me a plaque
     with my name on it!

Of course Kent wanted to take me
     out to celebrate...

  so I had to go. He loves me.

   almost got stepped on.

Oh, my God. Laila. Laila!

1993's calling.

It wants it's pink dress back!

Do you wanna hold her?

No.

I-I mean, I better not.

 Do you have to say no babies?

What was that?!

Oh, God. Hurry!

This is so great. You
    guys gotta watch this.

Get in the basket.
Daddy, help.

Go on Laila get in your basket.

Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

Everyone.

We have an announcement to make.

Some of you know already, but we
  were waiting until it was

confirmed to share the news with
       the rest of you.

You're pregnant!

Congrats!, That's so
          exciting!

Noooo.

  Eliott has been promoted to
      Vice-President...

of Nerd-dom at Marina Tech in-

We're moving to San
          Francisco.

San Franciso!!! WhooHoooo!

Get the fuck out of here
that's great! Congratulations!

San Franciso!!! WhooHoooo!

I got fired today.

  I got fired today. I can't
    believe I got fired.

   They kept Ephraim and he
    misfiles everything.

  He filed Watermaker before
         Wasserstein.

He's always late to work and he
takes two hour lunch breaks and

   the only reason he works
         so quickly

 is because he's hopped up on
            meth.

They fired the girl who never
     forgets a birthday.

Who works overtime for free! Who
   hand painted one hundred

 "I heart my co-worker" coffee
  mugs for Valentines day.

 And now my BFF is moving away!

   It's not fair. It's not
          faaaaair!

Bye, bitch.

Bye, bitch. I'm drunk.

Bye, Eliott.

Bye.

Byee. Bye pretty boy.

I can't find my other shoe.

Here, I'll help you.

 It just vanished. Just Whoosh!

    It's been such a hard
         couple days.

I...I lost my job and I lost my
boyfriend and I got my period.

Okay. I'll make up the couch.

Come on. Oh!

Ohhh. You guys are so sweet. I'm
    sorry I lost my shoe.

Thank you. I'm just gonna miss
         her so much.

I know.

Would you like to keep her at
 your house until Wednesday?

Yeah, it would really
          help us.

  Uh, we're gonna be moving
and she'll be under our feet--

Are you serious?! I'd love to.

    Well, did you hear that?

    You're comin' to camp
        Jill, Littles.

It's Laila

Mhmm.

Here's her snack bag and her wee
          wee pads.

    Make sure you have her
          blankie.

You have the 24 hour emergency
      vet number, right?

Don't worry.

Everything will be fine, she'll
       be safe with me.

Byeee.

 Call me if you need anything!

I will!

Bye!

Bye.

Let's get this ugly sweater off
         of you, huh?

ohhhhh!

  Oh my gosh, you know who's
     engaged this week?

Should I get engaged?

This is called Juicy Glow.

Do you want to stay and watch TV
   with me tonight, Shelby?

No.

Please Shelby?

No!

'Kay.

How much longer do you think?
Because, well, last time you...

didn't leave them in long enough
an-and it didn't really look any

different, and, oh, Kent really
      loves highlights.

Five minutes for you.

       Three for the dog.

Ya know, if you really want 'im
           back...

 you outta let me bleach your
           asshole.

How'd you find me?

Your mom told me.

 You know, she's really upset
 we're not together anymore.

Well, I'm kind of working,
   so... What do you want?

Um, well, you left this in
         my fridge...

   and I thought you might
      miss it 'cause...

 I know you love it an-and I
     don't really eat it,

so...

Well, where's my hot sauce? Been
        missin' that.

Why did you leave me? You never
          said why.

Because you wanted me to stay.

It's 1:30. Where is she?

What's she doing out there?

Jill?

Jill, what's wrong?

Jill, please roll down
         the window.

Jill, roll it down.

Where's Laila? Jill?

Jill, roll your window down!

Jill!

Open the door! Open this door
    and talk to me! Jill!

Where's Laila? Where is Laila?!

Answer her! Jill!

Where-is-Laila?! Jill!

Where's Laila?! Where's Laila?!
Where is Laila?! Where's Laila?!

Where is Laila?! Where is she?!

You let me in this car now!

Where-is-she?! Open
that door! Where's Lai-Laaaa?!

Goooooooone!!!

Abby!

What we have here is a canine
          emergency.

     Get your flyers and
      plaster the area.

Who's got West Valley bike path?

Sir. Yes, Sir!

I need your eyes and ears on me
           people.

Sandwich?

What kind?

It's meat Senorita.

This is a code red.

Ooh, sandwiches.

What time were you at
        the dog park?

Uh, the afternoon, between 12
          and 12:42?

Can you be more specific?!

I told you already. They
  took her at the dog park.

How many more times do I have
         to tell you?

As many times as it takes!

She was kidnapped at Laurel
       Park, Officer.

Has there been a ransom
           demand?

No! He wants to know what the
    kidnapper looked like.

What were you doing when she was
            taken?

I'm speaking. What did he look
            like?

Were you drinking?!

Um-uh-He was-over 6 feet tall,
            uh...

medium toned skin, 30's and uh,
  he had an anchor tattoo...

on his bicep and just beady eyes
       and wild hair...

an-and he was missing his left
            thumb.

I was picking up her doody and I
 looked away for one second.

          One second!

He wants to know what she was
           wearing.

Nothing. Well, it was hot so I
    took off her sweater.

Why do you keep doing that? She
      loves her sweater.

I am so sorry,
     I will do anything.

She wasn't wearing anything,
          Officer.

   The babysitter said she
 was more comfortable naked.

  Please tell me she had her
          collar on.

Well of course she had her
          collar on.

Collar?!

Ma'am are we talking
  about a dog, or a person?

A person! She won't even eat dog
            food.

   Tell me what kind of dog
           that is?

Spoiled.

I think I'm going to be sick.

Oh.

If he wants money...
 why hasn't he contacted us?

He will.

That's him! That's him.

Oh, no. Someone lost Perro
           Perdido.

Ay, Dios mio.

Our dog is missing. Have you
 seen her? Her name's Laila.

Laila?

Honey, Honey, no, no,
 that's not Laila. No. Sorry.

Laila!!! Laila!!!

      Laila! Laila! Laila!

  Laila! Laila! We love you,
        Laila! Laila!

Oh, my God.

Her D'Ugg

      We're losing light.

Awwwww

Get it!

Hello. Yes, it is.

No... I don't want my phone line
       over broadband.

Hang up!

Six months? No commitment?

I don't care! The kidnapper
 might be trying to call us!

I have your dog.

Oh, Jesus.

If you want to get your dog back

do not contact the police, or
        she will die.

Do not contact the FBI...

or she will die. Do not contact
Cesar Milan, or she will die.

Do not think you can outsmart
     me. I have a degree.

Place thirty thousand dollars...

in unmarked bills in a duffle
            bag.

The drop off will be tomorrow
  night,10 pm at the quarry.

Laila.

Do not be late, or she will die.

There's a quarry in LA?

I'm calling the police.

Are you crazy? He'll kill her.

         What do we do?

If you hadn't found Jill on
        Greg's list...

    this never would have
          happened.

She babysat her for a year. It
 coulda happened to anybody!

But it didn't. It happened with
    her and you hired her!

You don't know how that makes me
            feel.

You don't know how I feel.

What?! I'm the one in pain here.

This sucks.

I'm the one in real pain.

It places the lotion in the
           basket.

     No! The lotion goes
        in the basket!

  You spoiled, fucking Bitch.

I can't believe you
       made me drive...

 all the way to Silverlake to
        return a shoe.

What's Jill going to do with one
            shoe?

Hey there she is.

With Laila.

       Abby and Eliott
        What the Fu--

Hey, guys!

Where is she?

Oh, my shoe!

We know you kidnapped Laila!

Owwww!! Ohhh Goddd,
           owwwww!!

       Where did she go?!

She locked the door!

    Ohhh, no, no, no wait.

 Wait, we have your money. We
       have your money!

I'm gonna to kill you! Jill!!!

Oh! Watch out! Watch out! Outta
          the way!

    Outta the way! Laila!
       Lailaaaaaaa!!!!

Here's your fucking shoe!

Oh, my God. You think you know
          somebody.

You don't think she made her go
           in this?

How much money?

Thirty grand.

Thirty G's? Hell no!

   No money, no way, no how.

You don't negotiate with
         terrorists.

Just look for clues
        or something.

This is all just junk!

Ugh. Check on this. Check that
   out. Put that somewhere.

I can't do anything with
            that!

 Just fucking taxes from two
        thousand an--

You guys better come
        look at this.

Oh, my God.

We gotta catch that bitch and
        take her down.

  Where do you think she went?

No idea.

Wait a minute. Gimme your phone.
Gimme your phone.

    I think I can track her.

How?

I'm gonna drop a pin in her ass.

We're doing the right thing,
        right Littles?

I mean, you were suffocating in
     those clothes and...

  oh that stroller! God. You
 must've felt like an idiot.

If you wanna go back, bark three
    times in a row, okay?

         I'm listening.

Good.
   I agree with you. Whew.

Two independent girls, out on
         the road...

 kickin' ass and takin' names.

        Whoooooohoooooo!

Get on the highway. She got to
         the highway.

      Tur-turn right here.

Wait, right there?

Ri--ya missed it!

I'm sorry!

Okay!

This is exciting!

I feel like we're on and episode
       of Hart to Hart.

Jill, please, please,
   please please, please...

she'll just turn her phone off
   and we'll lose the blip.

Please just pull over somewhere
       so we can- Kat!

Listen, you skinny circus freak

Don't!

Forget about the ransom.

You're not going to see one red
            cent.

Turn the fuck around and give
them back their dog, or I'll-

Don't!

Just look at the map.

I can't tell which dot is ours.

Ours is the one with the arrow.

It's upside down!

Well, flip it back over.

Which dot!

It's not a dot! Why are you such
        a computard?!

Littles, I love you so much...

so F-ing much, that if I ever
lost you, I would shoot myself--

 in the head like this. Ruff!
        Ruff! Blooood!

   Blood and guts and brain
 everywhere. Oh, there's that

   memory. There's, there's
that time I went with Kent...

to the-to the diner and I had to
        buy his food.

And there's that time that I got
made fun of in second grade.

And there's that time that my
mom said I looked like a boy.

everywhere,
  all across the windshield.

    Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

Oh, my god! That's an invitation
        to pedophiles.

Hey pervert, here's all the info
 you need to kidnap my kids.

Now you can address them by name
   when you invite them...

     into your creepy van.

You can even
    invite Doug the cat.

      So the cat can get
fucked. In da back of da van.

Kat! Kat.

Yeah, you shouldn't say
       stuff like that.
What?

    I know Kat said that I
 wouldn't pay you anything,

but I'm willing to go halves.
That's fifteen thousand dollars!

I know you need it, so I am
    willing to compromise.

What are you doing?

I told you not to call her.

             Phone.

It's funny how people
          always d-

It's not funny.

Stop the car. Mama needs more
            vino.

Jill. Jill, listen. You can have
        all the money.

Jus-just tell us where to meet
            you...

 and you can have all of it,
      okay? I gotta go,

  but please, please, please
        call me back.

Signal's gone. Wonder why, Abby.

She turned her phone off! I told
     you not to call her!

It's like I'm not even here
          sometimes!

    Jesus Christ, you know
   I do know some things!

        Fuck! Goddamnit!

I'm sorry! I am sorry!

What if we never find her?

I'll buy you another Yorkie!

Vino!

Here!

Put your seat belt on!

I was going to!

Oh, stop it!

What's the game plan here?

We'll keep checking the phone...

 and hopefully she'll show up
            again.

I'm exhausted. Nap and then
           dinner?

Nap!

         Okay. Us too.

Oh, my god.

It's not that bad.

Ah. Oh, my God get it off. Get
     it off. Get it off!

Help! Help me!

Don't be a helpless victim.

 With the Medical alert belt
clip, help is only a beep away.

Did Jill turn her phone
             on?

No.

I'm going to get us some water.

Grab a hard piece of
        wood. Cherry-

Getting to first base in
          baseball-

I got us fried chicken!

 My favorite part of road trips

    is being forced to eat
        fat-ass food.

 Too bad I couldn't find the
         Creamy Cone.

Ah! Have I told you how much I
         missed you?

That's so sweet.

What is that?

You smell so good.
 What is that? Biscuit flour?

Okay. We already tried that at
         Lilith Fair.

I'm not being sexual, it's just
   that you smell really...

that my Grandma used to make for
  me and I really miss her-

Okay, you're a freak.

No! No!

Who wants some
     Chick-Chick-Chicken?

Is that your Mom?

I'll be in the bar.

   How can this place not
         have a bar?

Hey if you want to talk...
           okay...

Stan and Dan Janson...

Private Investigators at your
           service.

  Is your spouse cheating on
             you?

You need Real Professionals.

Is your employee embezzling
            funds?

You need Real Professionals.

Are you searching...

    for a long lost parent?

You need Real Professionals.

If you answered yes-

Yes!

to any of those questions.

     Then you need to call-

Us! Real Professionals!

Reeeaal Professionals.

How much longer are we
   going to hang out here?

What do you mean? As long as it
            takes.

The movers are coming tomorrow.

We need to figure this out, make
        some calls...

   start cancelling stuff,
something. She may never turn

her phone back on again. That's
 totally possible, you know.

We have no leads, nothing to go
     on. The ransom's...

 not even an option anymore.
She's too scared to claim it.

How do you know?

You can't get inside her head
     any more than I can.

What- the- what the hell am I
supposed to tell my new boss,

huh? Sorry, I can't move to San
        Francisco...

  cause my dog was kidnapped?

Tell him someone died.

Tell him your Mom died. I don't
            care.

   Laila and I would never
      move without you.

         I need candy.

Go get your candy.

Come on, Littles. Come on.

What's the plan?

Shhhhh!

You go that way.

You go that way.
I'll go this way.

Just do what I say!

I don't know what I'm supposed
            to do.

Gimme that!

Oh god!

My eyes!

Oh, crap! Oh crap!

Oh, my god it burns!

Oh, my god it burns. Oh, my god!

Oh, please let them be okay.

Don't look at me like that. It
          was dark.

  I thought they were rapists.

       Where is my purse?

Oh, I need water.

You two need Real Professionals.

Yeah, she's adorable. I'm sorry
     for your loss guys.

Thank you.

Anyways, uh...

let's get the necessities out of
          the way.

     The fee is gonna be
    $10,000 upon recovery.

No problem.

Oh, my god. Ahhh, yeah, okay.

Laila, she have any, ah, friends
  that are a little more...

unsavoury, maybe someone with a
         criminal...

record, a background, somethin'
          like that?

Oh, we know who did it. It was
    our dog sitter, Jill.

She did this.

She did?

She attacked us.

We don't feel comfortable...

  approaching her ourselves
         anymore...

    I mean, you can see why.

She sounds terrible.

Thank you.

  She told us that Laila was
    kidnapped and then...

  we caught her walking her
    outside her apartment.

Whaaat? That's crazy.

She's-Yes!

   She's a pathological liar.

And she was wasted at our going
         away party.

Here's a photo of her. Don't be
fooled by that Holiday smile.

She's pretty.
She's really pretty.

Are you sure this is the girl?

   I-I don't see how a girl
 this pretty could steal a d-

           Ah. Uh...

She did this.

She did this.

Yeah. I'll find her.

   I promise you guys. Okay?

Why is he eating now? Shouldn't
  he be catching up to her?

Ugh.

Thirty seven cents and two
       ketchup packets.

 That's all we have, Littles.
     Wanna meet my Mom?

I guess she's busy, Littles.

Hey! Hey! The blip came back on!

Hold on. Hold on. Let me handle
            this.

Okay.

Hey, Dan. Jill's GPS says she's
    just west of the 95...

and it looks like there aren't
    any towns around there

 or anything, so I'm thinkin'
she must be at a... rest stop?

Yeah-oh great!

 Perfect! Yeah, I'm just, I'm
 drivin' just east of there.

Oh, you are huh?

You-you said the 95, right?

Yeah.

Okay.  Not a problem.

   I am on the case. Got it.

   Have you forgotten what
     she did to our eyes?

Why is he taking photos?

We already showed him a picture
           of her.

She's going to the B room.

What is he doing in there?!

Why do you think I know what's
         he's doing?!

If Laila's only hope is him...

   then that pooch is Gone
         Doggy Gone.

The Hell she is!

What are you guys doin' here,
huh?! You guys followin' me?!

Someone has to be a detective!

Ah-ha-ha!

    I am being a detective!

    I-I-took incriminating
 photos and I bugged her car!

Why didn't you just grab her
     while she was here?

There's proper protocol you have
         to follow!

   These things take time,
            guys!

Come on! If I just grabbed her
    that's battery, okay?!

Stop following me, go back to
        your motel...

and I'll call ya when I get the
    dog. How 'bout that?

We'll stay at my Mom's in New
           Mexico-

Yes! New Mexico! Let's do this!

And then we'll get back on our
feet  and hit the road, Thelma!

         Arf! Arf! Arf!

Just had a very interesting
conversation with the Harmons.

      They are not happy.

Said you took all kinds of
     photos of that girl,

     and then let her get
     away. Is that right?

  -it is right, but I-I was
  establishing a pattern of

behavior to determine my rescue
          approach.

Danny! What did I say? KISS.
K-I-S-S. Keep it simple, stupid!

  You know where she is right?

Yes. Yes. I'm tailin' her right
 now. I got her in my sights.

Ah. Yeah, well, uh, then I don't
   see what the problem is.

   Mmmm. Get the Goddamn dog!

Hello?

Stan and Dan Janson.

    Private Investigators
         at your ser-

Barracks were utterly destroyed.

Most of the Military Personnel
of approximately 20 thousand...

were wiped out. The distorted
steel framework is all that...

 remains of a building which
        stood four...

Did Dan respond to your
  text or call or anything?

Let's see, thirty seconds ago
     he didn't respond...

a minute ago he didn't respond,
       two minutes ago-

Okay! I get it. Don't
     be a dick about it.

  Sorry. I'm annoying myself.

What's this? You're a smoker
    tryin' to quit, huh?

Nope. Just spearmint.

Ah. Cutesy little doll. Maybe a
   little drug trafficking?

No. Just a doll. Whoa. That's
            uh...

   That doll's had a rough
            time.

Whoa. Look at you, Jill. What's
   this for, huh? Stabbin'?

Doin' one of these?! Doin' one
   of these to somebody?!

           Heh heh.
  You're goin' down, babe.

  You are being tracked by a
   professional. Uhh. Kay.

Arf! Arf! Arf!
Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

Kat, go for a walk or something.
You're driving us crazy.

Stop it.

I can't. Devon took my medicine.

It's not medicine.
It's a crutch.

If it makes me feel better, it's
          medicine.

What's up? It's okay. I'm cool.
See I have a license.

 It's my get out of jail free
 card. Like if a cop came by,

     you could hand it to
     me and we'd be cool.

Phew....

Oh, yes... You saved my life.
Can I buy a little off you,

or a lot? I mean, however much
you can spare. I'm desperate,

well not desperate, okay, I'm
 desperate.  I-I'm travelling

with The Borings. Looking for
their kidnapped dog. The amount

of ransom they're spending on
that dog could feed a village

   in Somalia. I mean, I do
love Africa though. I've been to

Okay, just, shut
         up...please.

It's a hundred.

What?! That's not even an
 eighth. I've got like twenty

bucks! Wait! I'll grab some cash
off The Borings. They're just a

few doors down.  It'll
only take me a sec. Did I tell

you that I love your tattoo? I
almost got a tribal tattoo once

in Fiji, but Ichickened out when
I saw the  size of the needle. I

    mean it was this giant
   porcupine quill covered

in blood. Now, this was the 80's
  and AIDS was no laughing

matter. I was like, okay, stick
     that in my ass HIV.

Ah! Thank you! Thank
   you! Thank you!

Whoohoooo!!!

Thank you for coming to our
         rescue, Dan

Oh, pfft, it's no big deal
       really.

No, it is, I don't know how
  much longer we would have

lasted out here, so...
       thanks.

You don't have to keep
         thankin' me.

Well, if you'd accept my thanks,
I'd stop thanking you.

Fair enough, you're welcome.

Thank you.

Dan and Jill

Thank you.

Thank you. Yeah,
        well, I don't-

You got me confused.
Okay.

Holy Be-Jesus!

What?!

I have the same affirmation
            note!

Oh, my gosh.

Wow! This is unbelievable.
Unbelievable! And to think if

  my car hadn't broken down
  and you hadn't stopped to

save us, well we'd never know
 that there was someone else

 out there on the same lonely
highway with the same motto.
         Wow, right?

Yeah. Yeah, wow.

There are no
        coincidences.

Well, that went well.

I feel like they thought we
     were in some smarmy

        Greek threesome.

How are we gonna pay
        for the rooms?

Why did they target us? What
      did we do to them?

Sometimes bad things happen
       to good people.

Run.

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

Go! Go! Go!

So, why are you going to
      your Mom's house?

Oh! Umm... it's...Christmas,
  heh. Summertime Christmas!

You know we... we missed it last
year, so... so we're doing it

 now. Be both... we both have
 just been so busy, you know,

  and...and we never miss a
 holiday. We're very close.

She taught me everything I know
      about sandwiches.

Yeah, Dean, I know. I know I'm
late. I know, okay, uh, what did

  you say the cross streets
  were again? Hold on, just,

right. Okay, okay I have to get
  off the phone somebody's,

somebody's here. Okay, talk to
    you later. Bye.

What are you doing here?
You could have called.

I tried, but you didn't pick up.

Tell your boyfriend to
 move the car. I'm late for a
           showing.

What?!

Mom...I'm in big trouble.

Oh, Drama. Here we go. I'm
not giving you any more money.

           I can't.

Please hold her for me.

Make it quick.

I need-to talk to you.

I can't hear you when
you're whining, Bunny. Spit it
             out!

Could you please turn off your
            phone!

Ugh, believe me I'd love to, but
I'm obligated to my clients. Oh

hi, Sally. Ah, yes, I'm on the
way. Ah... the code is 8-5-6-7-9

     hmm...uh...sorry can
 you hold for just a moment?

Could I stay with you? Just
      for a little bit?

You always push.
Fine. The key's in the

armadillo. I'll be back by one
    and we'll sort it out.

And don't slam the door. You
 have to press in the tongue

   and release. No slamming!

Hey! Please stop! Stop.

I'm sorry. It was just awkward.
And ah...I wanted to give you

privacy. Oh! Here's your dog
back. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Umm... we're running low
           on fuel.

Oh, great!

What are we gonna do now?

Know what? My friend Zelda
 lives nearby. Saved the day!

Have fun with The Borings.

Oops.

Now, Where were we?

They were talking about
          their dog.

So, how did you two come
          together?

I asked her out after yoga
  class and she told me she
        was a lesbian.

I had to. It's like,
all the other guys I went out

None of them were
right! Especially Robert. Pfft.

What did you tell her about
           Robert?

Nothing. She's in tune.

SOUND

Yeah, right.

You have a really nice place.

I have to get real here. I'm
vibing in some very dangerous

fear between you two and it's
poison. It's toxic! I'm sorry

    but that's it. No more
bullshit stories. Yoga didn't

      bring you together.

That's how we met.

No! What brought you
      together really?!

I don't know what?

Oh ho ho! Have you thought about
why you're crossing your arms?
             Hmm?

Because it's comfortable?

Because it's freezing in here?

Because you're closing yourself
 off. Because you're afraid!

Afraid of what?

You tell me.

No, you tell me.

Is "no" your favorite word?

No.

Don't.

Let these-

Stop it.

go.

No.

Push the reset button!

No.

Is it so hard to say yes?

I'll never understand that.
It's so easy. Yes!

No.

Yes!!

No!

Yeeeeeeeeeees!

No! Okay! Yes! Yes! Mother
fucking yes! Are you all happy?

       Is this happiness?

I'm sorry. Oh, God.

I kissed him. He didn't
         do anything.

Abby ; How long has this been going    on?
 Wait a minute when-

when I-when the robbers came in
  and you two were in your

   underwear were you-were
         y-were you?

No! No! No way! No. No.
   I did- I didn't do shit!

They were just some hoodlums
     I bought weed from.

What?!

I knew you did that!

I'm sorry, I fucked up I didn't
       know they were-

Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. You're sorry that

    you got us robbed, or
    you're sorry that you

 kissed my husband. It's not
  enough that your life has

        gone to shit,
   you have to ruin mine?

You don't need me to fuck
        up your life!

Who goes on a cross country
  crusade to find a dog?!!!

 Yeah, I said it. A dog! You
 could have a real baby, but

      noooo, it's easier
to treat your dog like a baby!

hmm-mm, hmm-mm.
Laila is our baby.

A human baby! It's embarrassing!
People make fun of

you when you push her around in
        that stroller!

No they don't!

You put little bonnets on her!

I don't put bonnets on her.

If you want a baby.
Have a baby.

I don't want a baby.

Wait. You don't want a baby?

Why the Hell not?

None of your business!

I thought we were
waiting until we're financially
        ready to like-

It's not about the
 money. I work seventy hours

 a week. I don't have time. I
   travel. I'm bi-coastal.

      I'm in Europe half
          the year.

Then quit your job
and start your clothing line!

      What's the problem?

Yeah, I mean you
   could work from home and

we can like pool our resources
          together-

You're folding your
         arms again!

So, you are closed off!

Abby, open up!

Wh- why, tell us why, you don't
 want a baby? I want to know!

Why don't you
       want a baby?!!!

Okay! Okay! Okay! I am...
      afraid of babies.

Really?

Yes.

What?

I...have never actually held
one. I've had the opportunity,

but I'm afraid that I will drop
  them because they are soft

and delicate and they are like
little birds with no feathers.

Are you serious right now?

I'm totally serious. It is not
 hard to accidentally kill a

baby. People do it all the time.
It's always on the news. They

have tiny breathing holes and
 their heads are mushy. What

if you think that they're crying
and they're actually bleeding

internally? I don't want that
kind of pressure. I don't want

      to be a bad parent.

That's so fucking stupid.
That came out wrong.

it's just...I want someone to
     make a family with.

Well, then stop dating boy
 scouts and date someone with

some faults like the rest of us.
You deserve Taylor Lautner and,

         and the rest
  of us get Jason Alexander?

Thanks.

Grow up, Kat. You're 42.

I am?

Abby?

SOUND

It's gonna be really hard for
 me to trust you for a while.

I know.

But you're my best friend
    and I love you. I do!

I love you too.

And I want to believe. I do, I
    believe that you were

   fucked up and lonely and
 desperate and really creepy!

Thank you!

Don't! Don't push it.

'kay.

But mostly you've been a really
good friend to me. And I want

 you to know that I did hear
  you, and...I will consider

  giving up the stroller and
   possibly the baby Bjorn.

And I'll cut back on the wine
  except on the weekend, and

Holidays and special occasions,
but otherwise it's like, none!

           You know?

Okay.

I..I-I'm still gonna wipe
 Laila's ass with baby wipes

  because to me that's just
 hygienic and she sleeps in
           the bed.

Agreed.

And we're not boring.

I know you're not.

Not all the time.

SOUND

Hey.

Hi.

Can I come in?

You want a Bloody Mary?

SOUND

I don't want to lose you over
   this stupid job.

it's... I'll support you in any
 decision you plan on making,

  okay? Cause I know you'll
     make the right one.

  Cause you're a good person.

The right decision is to give
        the dog back.

I know. I really want to...

SOUND

Hair of the dog.

Mmm!

          PHONE RINGS

It's Dan!

I wanna make a deal.
Jill is willing to give Laila

    back, but no jail time.

A-And the ransom, the
   ransom was just a ruse.

And, she's super sorry.

Whose side are you on?

Ah, I-I'm on the side of
     everybody wins here.

Are you fucking her?

Ah. Ah, no, let, let's, let's
just say things have changed,

            alright?

He's fucking her.

Okay, that's the deal you got
   it? And I want ten grand

an-and-and that's a fee, that is
 not a ransom. I want to make

that perfectly clear! Alright. I
    wanna rendevous at 5pm

      Occupado and 110th.

Say twenty paces in.

Just say it. Just say it.
       Say it.

And I want it. I want it to
     be twenty paces in.

You know what? The desert
    is almost as original

 as the quarry, and I can hear
     you breathing Jill.

It's remote, and no cops!
There's any cops and we're out!

That's it!

Whirrr!

That's us drivin' away like
       bats outta Hell!

Okay. Thank you so much!

She's like a giant squid.

Thank you! Ahhh! Okay. Bye!

What if we don't move to
        San Francisco?

Really?

Yeah, I can work from home. You
could start your line, and we

would have more time together
    and we could work on-

Yes.

Yes?

Mhmm.

Just because we have to say
  goodbye doesn't mean that

 I don't love you, but I know
      that they do too.

I'll always hold you here in...
          my heart.

Somebody hates you.

Clearly. You owe me for
          the door.

Go ahead. What are you waiting
         for? Shoot!

I'm afraid of you.

Come on!

I'm afraid you'll be defensive.

What'd I do?!

You worked too much. I was
  a little kid and you left

me alone all the time. I mean,
 I-I know I was mature for my

       age,  but I was
  only 10! I felt abandoned.

I never abandoned you! I had to
     work! Oh! You are so

ungrateful! What was I supposed
  to do, huh? I was a single

 parent. I worked 60 hours a
week, taught jazz, tap, ballet

on the weekends...tell me how
     you'd do it smarty?!

I don't know! I just missed you!

Jill Tozer!

That's my Dad. He was in the
  driveway when I got here.

Alright.

Ow!

What?!

I said I had this
        under control.

Danny! Danny!
I know you can hear me!

No! No! No! No! I am not
    harbouring criminals!

  Get out of my house! Get!
      Out the back! Go!

What?!

Goddamn it, Danny!

I'm goin' in.

Just let the experts
         handle this.

What makes you think
     they can handle it?

Uncle Morty?

Hey, Danny.

Hey, I told you son,
Morty doesn't operate well on

extended deadlines. He started
   to doubt that I got the

      money coming to me.

Oh, come on, Uncle Morty.

Don't mess with Morty! I know
he's like an Uncle to you, but

make no mistake he'll cut your
          balls off!

Ah, I see the money's here. Get
over here with the rest of them.

It's-it's okay he's with me,
    just do what he says.

Give me back my dog!

That's your dog? I don't blame
you for being upset. Somebody

took my dog, I'd put a fucking
     hole in their head.

You give the dog back. You hand
   over the money, and you

         open the bag.

Well, thank you for everything.
Nice to meet you. Thank you.

What's the rush?

Oh, my God.

What's this? What is this?!

It's a tomato.

It's a-an heirloom tomato.

This some kind of fuckin' joke?

We got robbed.

What?!

SOUND

Keep me in the game coach!

Go! Get out of here!

Thank you! Thank you!

This way!

You like tuna?

I'll make you a sandwich. I got
      fresh cucumbers.

I got romaine from the garden. I
got fresh avo, yeah, I've got

some mustard that I just bought
 at the farmer's market and

 some hot, delicious, crusty
          baguettes.

SOUND

What about pudding? You got any
           pudding?

I don't have any pudding.
I don't know what

        happened to it.

SOUND

Whoa! Yeah! Bite.

SOUND

SOUND

I'll get it.

Okay.

         C'mon, c'mon.

Oh, thank you.
