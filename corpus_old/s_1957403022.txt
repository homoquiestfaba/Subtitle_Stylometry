[RAIN PATTERING]

KALI: Sorry,
I'm nervous.

VERONICA:
It's okay. No rush.

Let's talk boundaries.

I'm up for anything.
No boundaries for me.

KALI: What?

Did you talk about your
boundaries before this?

Well, sort of.
Maybe... not really.

Well, um, is there anything
you don't want Juna to do?

I don't know.
I didn't really think about that.

What about you, Juna?

Is there anything you
don't want Kali to do?

Um...

No. [CHUCKLES]

What if she
ignores you?

That depends.

So, you're okay, if she pays
no attention to you whatsoever?

Oh.

I didn't say that.

You know, the most important
thing is to listen.

So, if something doesn't feel
right, then speak up.

<i>â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª</i>

[ALL LAUGHING]

<i>â™ª</i>

[BOTH GRUNTING]

Maybe we could have
dinner next time.

JUNA: Only if I get
to eat off you two.

KALI: Oh, my God.
You never want to eat off of me.

Okay.

Thank you.
Oh, wait. Three...

VERONICA:
<i>I move in the way</i>

<i>I know how to
make myself come,</i>

<i>and when I'm close,</i>

<i>I pull Kali's hair and
kiss her with abandon.</i>

<i>I'm in ecstasy as my
climax erases all thought,</i>

<i>and I'm fully present with
this couple I hardly know.</i>

<i>It's strange, though,
for the first time in ten years,</i>

<i>in the end,
I feel... nothing.</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>In the end,
I'm still amazed</i>

<i>that three people
can come together</i>

<i>in mutual desire
and not fall apart.</i>


Nice.

Hey,
you're Veronica Willow right?

Veronica Williams.
Yeah. Do I know you?

I'm a super fan of your blog.
Oh, cool.

Yeah. Sex with
intention, I love that!

Thank you.
It's, like, about love and connection, right?

Exactly, yeah.
[CHUCKLES]

I can't believe I'm standing
here talking to you.

This is nuts.
Right in front of my building.

Can I take
a selfie real quick?

Uh, sure.
Just real quick.

Get that for me.
Okay.

Thanks. I got short thumbs.
Okay.

Yeah, I'll put that
right on my Instagram.

Okay, nice to meet you.
I got, like, 38 followers.

Hey, I'm so curious about
that polyamory stuff.

Yeah, a lot of people are.
It's...

It's wild, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, cool.
If you have any questions,

just leave a comment
and I'll respond.

I got to say,

you are so gorgeous...

Like, right here
right now. Are you...

I mean...
Thank you.

You ever think about doing porn
or, you know?

No.

No. Have you?


Watch out.

MAYA:
And, up.

And Swan Dive down.

If you're warmed up,
go ahead to the Upward-Facing Dog.

And, breathe.

From here,
reach forward with the right hand,

reverse the Warrior.

And Warrior Two.

From here, let's take a side-angle
pose, elbow on the knee,

hand to the ground,
or take it behind.

Just extend the energy
through your fingers.

MAYA: See our
chemistry, baby.

And Warrior Two.

Relax the shoulders.

It's a fucking horse penis.
[LAUGHS] Seriously.


Come to Chemistry
with me on Saturday.

Babe, you know how
I feel about that.

Well, hello, ladies.

VERONICA: Hi.
Can I help you with anything today?

Looking for something to dominate
my wayward girlfriend with.

Okay, well, this is
a beginner's crop.

It's very lightweight.

But, if you're looking for
something a little bit more intense,

check this one.

Uh, thank you.
We are just browsing.

Ah, okay. Well, let me know if there's
anything else I can do to help.

JOANNE: Thank you.

It's intense.
Mm.

I don't know.
I can handle it.

Yeah, I'm sure
you could.

But, you don't want
me to go to Chemistry.

No, it's cool...

as long as you respect
the boundaries.

Of course.

Of course.
Who do you think I am?

You like that?

[VIBRATOR BUZZING]

You know, there are so many
hot, sexy women

who would love to play
with us at Chemistry.

I'm gonna tie you up,
so you can't move.

Fuck you so hard

you won't think of
anyone else but me.

[BOTH LAUGH]

VERONICA: <i>Many of
you have asked me,</i>

<i>"Is true love a reason
to be monogamous?"</i>

<i>Well, I can only
speak for myself.</i>

<i>There's no such thing
as happily ever after.</i>

<i>There's no such thing
as "the one".</i>

<i>But, if I can find a
little bit of "the one",</i>

<i>in each person
I fall for,</i>

<i>and they see a little
bit of "the one" in me,</i>

<i>what could be more
romantic than that?</i>

Move your right arm
a little that way.

A little more.

How's your mother?

PEDRO:
She's doing better.

I think I'm going to visit
her for spring break.

My cousin has a new
tour company in Tulum.

Can make some
extra money.

What about
your classes?

Just for a few weeks.
Don't worry,

I'll be back.

Come to Chemistry
with me this Saturday.

I wish I could,
but I work the late shift.

VERONICA: [SIGHS]
I need a break.

Hmm.

Hey, Tai.

Love the last

Thank you.
Thank you.

This one's on us.

Thank you!
Enjoy.

ALL: [CHEERING]

You, look at you.
What's happening?

Actually, I'm corporate Caesar.
Oh, yeah. Nice.

VERONICA: <i>Each party holds
a possibility of forgetting,</i>

I didn't mean to...
Why don't you lick it off?

Excuse me?

The mess you made
on her boots.

Why don't you
lick it off?

they bumped into...

Sure, sure. Yes, right.
It wasn't my fault.

It's okay.
I'm just playing.

Sure, you are.

[ALL CHEERING]

See you later?
Mm-hmm.

<i>â™ª</i>

I'll just...

VERONICA: Have you been
to Chemistry before?

DANIEL: No.

My friend didn't tell me it
was this kind of party...

VERONICA:
What? Really?

...where people
have sex.

So, who's your friend?

Oh, over there,
with the blue suit.

That's Benton.
He's my friend, too.

Really?
Yeah.

Wow. What a small world.
Yeah.

I'm Veronica.
Daniel.

[CROWD APPLAUDING
AND CHEERING]

Oh, so, um,
you're married?

Yes.

Is she here?
No.

What's your agreement?

What do you mean,
"agreement"?

Veronica.
VERONICA: Hello.

Well, have fun.

DANIE: You, too.

Maybe next time you
can bring your spouse.

Babe, Dexter was too
ridiculous today. Look.

What did he do now?

I totally caught this...
Oh, no.

[CAT MEOWING
OVER THE PHONE]

Why is he always doing that?
Aww.

Oh wait, watch this.
He's so cute.

No, no.

[GLASS BREAKING

[LAUGHS]
Do you think that's funny?

That's not funny.
He just broke that glass.

Did you say
anything to him?

Well, I tried to.

Yeah, right.
No, you didn't.

Oh, Dexter.

[DOOR OPENS]
WOMAN: Come on in.

Hey.

Hi. Hi.

[CATS MEOWING]

[MAN SPEAKING

We have a studio for
$1,500 in Flatbush.

Does that
interest you?

We have...
[PHONE RINGS]

Excuse me.
[CLEARS THROAT]

Burr Real Estate,
Daniel speaking.

VERONICA: [OVER PHONE] <i>Hi, Daniel,
it's Veronica from Chemistry.</i>

Benton gave me
your number.

Yeah, from work.

I was wondering if you would
like to go to dinner with me.

A date? No, not really. I...

maybe he told you that I'm a blogger

and I blog about sex
and relationships.

And, yeah,
you're interesting to me,

and I've been looking
for new subjects.

Well, I don't meet that many
monogamous people at Chemistry.

And, so, I'm curious, uh,
what it was like for you.

Yeah, well, no pressure,
and it's up to you.

You're going to
love this place.

I know the chef.

He sources everything
from local farms.

Yeah. So, everything is organic

and you can really
taste the difference.

Oh, his pork belly with
truffle oil is to die for.

Mmm.
[SMACKS LIPS] Yes.

So, did you enjoy the
rest of the party?

Yes.
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]

I didn't do anything,
but it was interesting to watch.

Uh-huh.

First time for
everything, right?

Right. [LAUGHS]

Yeah.
Yeah.

Um, what do you think
about super spicy food?

I love it.
I mean, I'm Korean, so yeah.

Well, me,
I can only handle a little spice.

I'm... ginger.

Ginger's my favorite.

Ginger's my favorite
spice also.

Really?
Yes.

Wow.
It's so versatile.

It is. It is.
It's so versatile.

Yeah.
Yeah.

DANIEL: ...it just
doesn't help

not knowing
anyone like that.

Yeah, well,
ask away

'cause I'm open to
answering all questions.

I usually ask people to
take their shoes off inside.

Right.
Yeah, me, too.

If that's okay.
I do the same thing.

You don't know what you're
stepping on outside.

Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.

[CLEARS THROAT]

So, this is my place.
I'm gonna turn the light on.

Wow.
This is my place.

It's beautiful.
Welcome.

Ah, there's a cat.

This is Lulu.
This is Lulu.

Yeah.
You're so beautiful.

VERONICA:
Mm, wow, okay.


Hi.
Hey.


Yeah, take this off.
[MOANS]

VERONICA:
Yeah.


Um, can we just do it
somewhere else?

Oh, yeah,
yeah, sure.

This is kind of awkward.
Yeah.

Okay.

[VERONICA LAUGHING]
It's just...

DANIEL: Okay.

Turn.
Yeah.

DANIEL: Yeah.


[BOTH MOANING]

VERONICA:
Oh, my God.

I'm gonna come.
Oh, yeah, come.

Aww. You're so pretty.
Hey.

Lulu?
Yeah, she likes you.

Yeah? Hey.

[VERONICA GIGGLES]

Do you have a cat?

Yes. We have a cat.

Dexter.

Aww.
Yeah.

DANIEL:
I...

I usually
don't do this.

Oh, me neither.

I usually don't sleep with married
people unless they are poly.

Would you like
some water?

Uh, no.

Are you going
to tell your wife?

No.

Well, I have to
tell my girlfriend.

I thought you can do
whatever you want.

No, no.
We have agreements.

[DANIEL LAUGHS]

I have to go.

Okay.

Bye.

[DOOR CLOSES]

JOANNE:
That fucking Pedro.

VERONICA:
It wasn't Pedro.

You could have
checked in.

I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

I got carried away.
Look, we have a relationship.

Yes.

Yes. I'm sorry.
There wasn't a convenient time.

Did you enjoy it?
Joanne, please.

Did you enjoy it?

JOANNE:
I love you.

I fucking love you.

I did poly.

For you.

Hey, everyone.

This is my bisexual girlfriend.

Stop.
She only wants to be with me

if she can be
with guys, too.

You always had someone else
in the back of your life.

You don't care about me or anyone.
No.

No.
No.

MAN: Hey, hey!

What the hell!
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

WOMAN: What the fuck!
What's wrong with you?

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

VERONICA: <i>Relationship
agreements are like allergies.</i>

<i>There's no
obvious reason</i>

<i>why one person has
a violent reaction</i>

<i>if her husband holds another
woman's hand in a movie theater,</i>

<i>while another,
like my ex-girlfriend,</i>

<i>explodes when I have
sex with someone else</i>

<i>in our apartment.</i>

<i>Polyamory makes me feel
like I'm above cheating</i>

<i>because I make my own
rules and agreements.</i>

<i>But when I break
my rules,</i>

<i>there's no one
else to blame.</i>

<i>Joanne was never totally
comfortable with my lifestyle.</i>

<i>I needed to end my
relationship with her,</i>

<i>but I didn't know
when or how.</i>

<i>Along came someone
to do it for me.</i>

[SIREN WAILING

Red's my color.

Oh...

[SPEAKING SPANISH]

You do that.
Mm.

[GRUNTS SOFTLY]
Oh, wait, wait.

I am a delicate flower.

Oh, my...


I read your story,
<i>preciosa,</i>

it made me cringe,
it made me laugh,

it made me
want more.

My apology.

Close.

[SPANISH SONG PLAYING]

Yeah, well,
my followers don't want art,

they want smut.
[CLICKS TONGUE] So what?

Do what you want,
don't care what they think.

That was actually...

Oh, God, I look
like my mother.

[BOTH LAUGH]

DANIEL: Have you
always been polygamous?

Well, it was
always in me,

but my first love was
blissfully monogamous.

We were so young
and in love.

It didn't feel like
monogamy, you know.

Yeah.

But it ended,

and monogamy hasn't
appealed to me since then.

You know, I feel
weird saying this,

but after you
and I had sex,

I went home and had
sex with my wife.

Oh!

We hadn't had
sex in months.

You're welcome?

You inspired me.
[BOTH LAUGH]

Are you sure
it wasn't guilt?

I did feel
guilty at first.

But then, I felt more
attracted to her.

I, uh...

I would love to
keep seeing you.

The hope that it will bring
something back to my marriage.


Does this mean you'll go
to a sex party with me?

I mean,
you and your wife.

Oh, I don't know.


So, babe, uh...

Baby, what do you...

How do you feel about
going to a party

that is actually
a sex party,

but, um...

It's like a sex party,
but no pressure.

We could just kind of drink
and chill out and make friends.

KIRSTEN: You want me
to go to an orgy?

Well, it's not just a
bunch of people fucking,

it's an actual party,
you know.

They have separate rooms for
mingling, drinks, food.

It's a really cool,
like, situation.

No.


Look, we don't have
to do anything,

we could watch,
you know...

Babe, in therapy,
you said you'd try new things.

Look, if you want to see other
people, then go ahead.

Are you sure?

No, but...

maybe it's
the best thing.

Look, I'll let you know if
anything happens or I meet someone.

I don't want to hide anything from you.
No.

Please don't.

Okay.

â™ª

DANIEL: Wow,
you look amazing.

Thank you.

Ah. Oh...

tada.

You like it?
It's beautiful.

Thank you.

Golden rule is
"ask before you touch".

Okay.
Just remember that.

Hi.

No pressure, okay?

No expectations.

You don't have
to do anything...

not even with me.

[SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING]

Hello, sir.
I remember you.

Yeah, I remember you, too.

Do you want a drink?

Come on, let's get a drink.
Yeah.

Check it out.
Amazing. So, um...

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

May I kiss you?

Is it 11:00 already?

VERONICA: She's fine.
We'll see her later.

Okay.
She's doing her serving shift.

DANIEL: Oh, okay.

[EXHALES DEEPLY]

Fancy meeting you here.
Hello.

Hi.

Oh, look who I found?

KALI: Hi,
good to see you.

Will you come
and play with us?

Well, I'm here with
a date tonight.

Well, have fun.
We'll try.

[CHUCKLES]
You will.

What do you call this?
What is that?

Maybe later...

VERONICA:
Excuse me.

That maybe gives her
permission to keep trying.

What do you want?

I want you.

I want to be
with you.

And maybe your
friend over there.

[VERONICA LAUGHS]

Good answer.

Well, that's a lot of
firsts for one night.

Congratulations.

Thank you.
You're a natural.

Yeah?
Yeah.

I didn't think, uh,
I would like seeing you

with someone else,
but it actually felt really open.

I felt happy for you.

That's compersion.

Compersion?
Mm-hmm.

It's the opposite
of jealousy.

Oh, does that mean
I'm poly now?

No.
Ah.

Going to a sex party
doesn't make you a poly.

Besides, you haven't seen
me with another guy yet.

Okay. One step
at a time.


Hmm.

Want to come over?

Uh...

I told Kristen
that I'm coming home.

Coming home
from what?

You know,
out drinking with the guys.

[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] One
of them got really drunk,

you know, one of those things.
Yeah, yeah.

Well, I'll just
call a car.

Yeah.
I'll wait until...

You know,
with you until the car comes.

No, no, that's okay.

You sure?
Yeah.

We'll talk.

Get home safe.
Thanks.

<i>Without him, I still have

Here.

Take this apricot.

Just feel your

You are a goddess.

Um... dig in.

Hey, hey, hey.

Hmm.
[DANIEL SIGHS]

What's up, girl?
Hey, girl!

DANIEL: Aww, she needs a playmate.
What?

You should get
another cat.

Yeah, but we have
a special bond.

I don't want to lose
that to another kitty.

That won't go away.

It'll never go away.

[CHUCKLES]
Right, cutie?

Bye.

Did you wash me
off you?

Hmm, good question.
Let's check.


Can you tell me?


Hey.

Where have you been?

Uh, I had showings
all day in Harlem.

I asked you to do
laundry three days ago.

Well, I was
busy selling...

trying to sell
apartments, so.

You can at least pretend
like you still live here.

DANIEL: <i>I don't know. It's like
I've been saying this for months,</i>

but where are my needs?

I mean, they're
not being met.

It's not that hard
to meet them.

the best I can.

I mean, we haven't
had sex for months,

which sucks.
Yeah.

And then,
he wants to go to culinary school

and we barely paid
rent last month.

I rented a lot of shitty apartments
so you could pursue your dream.

You know that, right?

I get it.
You're having a midlife crisis.

But why should...

Okay. [SIGHS]

Why should I
give up everything

so you can just
keep struggling?

I don't understand.

Hey, how are you?
I've been thinking about you.

DANIEL: [OVER PHONE]
<i>Not so well.</i>

[CLICKS TONGUE] Oh.

What's been going on?

<i>Kirsten and I are
getting a divorce.</i>

<i>Wow.</i>

Feel like my soul has
been ripped out of me.

Oh, yeah,
that's understandable.

We were together
for 12 years.

I don't know
how to be now.

Like, who am I without
her, you know?

Well, you're still you.

[WOMAN SPEAKING KOREAN]

I guess.

<i>Who is that?</i>
It's my mom.

I think you...

You need to take sometime
to rediscover yourself,

<i>and, um, maybe get out of
town for a little while.</i>

You know, my parents,
they live in Connecticut,

so, um,

<i>maybe you and I could...</i>
Oh.

[DANIEL SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE]

[BOTTLE CLANGS]

Sorry, is this a bad...
Yeah...

[SPEAKING KOREAN]

I'm so sorry.

Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to...

I'm so sorry,
I'll call you back.

Okay. Bye.

[DANIEL EXCLAIMS]

[SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS]

[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]

Hi, Dad.

Hi, sweetheart.
Mm, hi.

Hi.

TRACY: <i>This chicken is fabulous.</i>

What is that,
sage?

Yes, I thought I'd try
something a little adventurous

since we're having a chef
dining with us tonight.

Oh, no.
Chef-in-training.

Yeah. Oh, mm.

So, Daniel,
what's your background?

Where are you
from, Daniel?

Uh, Queens,
yeah, New York.

But where are you really from,
where, you know, originally?

My family is
from Korea,

but I'm from Queens,
born and raised.

Got you. Yeah.

Yeah.

Welcome.

So, Luke, Veronica tells
me you work in finance.

Hedge funds.
You invest?

Oh, I would like to,
but I don't have anything to invest,

you know. [CHUCKLES]
You don't need a lot. Start small...

Very smart.
...try new emerging markets.

Performance is
the key now,

even more so than
liquidity or transparency.

It's on the up
and up again now.

After '08, we had
to sell a boat...

Yes.
...downsize to two cars...

Anyway, what are you
up to these days?

So many projects,
I can't keep up.

Um...
There's your lust blog.

Is it like Dan Savage?

I listened to
his podcast once,

He sounded really gay.
[CHUCKLES]

JANET: Not to
change the subject,

we're so happy Veronica
finally settled down.

We were concerned...
What do you mean "concerned?"

Well, you know,
about your "roommate situation".

Well, Joanne was never
my roommate, Mom.

Why didn't
you tell us?

I don't know. I just didn't
think that you wanted to...

Besides, it doesn't
matter now

'cause you're
with Daniel.

Yes. Well,
just because I'm with a man now

doesn't mean
I'm heteronormative.

JANET: Where do
get these words?

Oh, come on.
Now, I'm insulted.

What I mean is,
we're not a conventional couple.

I mean,
sometimes we...

What?
...do things with other people.

Wait a minute.
Are you saying you're swingers now?

Oh, my God!
I saw a show about that.

It's not exactly
swinging.

Swinging is related,
but it's more like open relationships,

you know, consensual.

What, are you
polygamous or...

No, we're
polyamorous.

What?
Um...

"Poly" coming from the
Greek meaning "many,"

and "amory" or "amorous"
meaning "love."

Yeah.

Oh.
So, it means many loves.

VERONICA: Yeah.
Beautiful.

You know, your mom and I were
invited to a key party once.

[LAUGHS] What?
We didn't go, of course.

VERONICA: Why not?
Why not?

Please, let's not
even discuss it.

We're having dessert, right, Janet?
Yeah.

Yeah, there'll
be dessert.

Please, eat up more if you can.
Okay.

TRACY: Yeah.

[PEOPLE ARGUING INDISTINCTLY
IN THE DISTANCE]

[BOTH MOANING]

Hi, how are you, beautiful?
Hey!

What's up, man?
VERONICA: Yeah. Thank you.

This is your first time at Polly Cocktails?
DANIEL: Yes.

[ALL CHEERING]

I think I've seen
most of you naked.

Who's getting naked?

Uh-uh. Not that
kinda party.

Veronica already
told me well in advance.

MAYA: Daniel is
an amazing cook.

Ooh!

Don't be modest.
I'm not being modest.

So, what have you been up to?
Any new projects?

Actually, have a seat.
Yes.

MAYA: You know,
I love you two together.

I'm glad you came.
Me, too.

I'd love to see
more of you.

Yeah. You're right.
Yeah.

Both of you, together.
Me, too.

Actually, I'm working on a documentary.
Yeah?

Yeah. About poly.

And I was thinking of you
as a possible subject.

Me?

Well, I wonder why.
I don't know anything about poly.

Ah, come on, girl.
[BOTH LAUGH]

You're so gorgeous.
You're so gorgeous.

Oh, yeah, hi. Daniel.
I'm Jasmine.

Hi.
Hi.

Hi.
Hi.

VERONICA: <i>When couples
talk about sharing,</i>

<i>it usually doesn't include sex and
romantic love with other people.</i>

<i>Anything that threatens to upset
the paradigm of two is risky.</i>

<i>But, mutually adding a third
person to a relationship</i>

<i>has the power to expand
the intimacy of sharing.</i>

<i>Beyond the pleasure and
variety polyamory brings,</i>

<i>it is enlightening
to see my partner</i>

<i>through the desiring eyes
of someone else.</i>

<i>When Maya laughs at Daniel's
jokes, I laugh, too,</i>

<i>as if hearing them
for the first time.</i>

<i>I see myself in her
wanting him</i>

<i>and I want her more.</i>

<i>Her desire reminds me
how desirable he is</i>

<i>and I desire him more.</i>

<i>For the first time, I believe that
three might be better than two.</i>

Shall we get dessert?
Yes.

Mm. Let's ask
for dessert.

Hi.

Let's just ask
for a check.

I'll be right back.

Daniel.
Kirsten, hey.

What are you
doing here?

I'm just here
with some friends.

You don't have to put on that
act for my benefit anymore.

Well, you didn't
want to know, so.

I'm taking care
of the check.

Oh, good. Good.

Hi, I'm Maya.
Kirsten.

Nice to meet you.

And this is Veronica.
Hi.

I know.

We were
the perfect couple

and we just couldn't
make it work.

How are you gonna
do any better?

Well, we're not
a couple.

We're... a triad.

It was nice
meeting you.

VERONICA: Ooh.

MAYA: What's your safe word?
VERONICA: Kitten.

MAYA: Kneel.

[GRUNTS SOFTLY]

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

So, you saw Maya
on Saturday?

Yeah. Uh, I went
to her place.

So, we were gonna
go out to eat,

but I was really horny,
so I kissed her

and kinda nudged her
onto the bed.

Mmm.

So, you, uh...
before dinner?

Yeah, yeah.
We had sex before dinner.

Yeah.
Oh.

Then we went to a Mexican
restaurant and we talked a lot.

I didn't think we would
have so much in common.

Um, did you know
she's divorced?

No. No, I didn't
know that.

Talked a lot
about you.

I told you
to be present.

I was present.

I talked about you
because...

you're an important
part of my life.

Aww.

Well, okay.
That's good.

Yeah, I know.

Yeah, and then we
went back to her place

and, um,
we fucked again.

And, uh...

Was it good?

Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

And by then,
it was like 3:00 in the morning,

and she said I could
sleepover if it was too late.

So...

That wasn't part
of our agreement.

It was so late...
you know.

I did leave early in the
morning, though. Come on.

Okay.

Yeah. I mean,
that's fine.

Right?
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.

LARK: They look so happy.
VERONICA: I know.

VERONICA: Do you know how
long they've been together?

It's their 20th anniversary.
Wow.

JASMINE:
That is so romantic.

I wanna cry.
That is so beautiful.

TEDDY: Hello, hello.
JASMINE: Hi!

Veronica,
you remember our boyfriend Ted.

Of course.

TEDDY: We go way back.
Ah, yeah.


So, how do you balance
it, the three of you?

It balances itself.

We communicate,
trust each other.

I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

Well, with two gorgeous
partners, of course you are.


There's my man.

Honey, are you
jealous?

No.
It's okay to feel jealous.

I know, I know.
But I'm not.

Maybe you need
to be more bold,

you know,
if you want to move on the scales.

LARK: Tip the scales.
JASMINE: Yes, tip the scales.

You know, it's so nice to finally
have a real date with you.

Thank you for
the opportunity.



Wow.
The Healthy Hedonist.

What inspired you to put
those two things together?

Um, well, you know
how you get high

and have hours
of wild sex...

Mm-hmm.
...but then next day you do nothing,

you do nothing
but cleanse and fast

and squeeze out
the toxins

through yoga and meditation.
[MOANS SOFTLY]

Mm.

Sort of.

Sounds kind of
extreme, though.

what you're saying.

But it's all
about balance.

Yeah.

Living into
your pleasure.

I don't know, just being present
with what you're actually...

[PHONE DINGS]
Sorry. Just give me one moment.

You know poly people,
they're always checking in.

Yeah.

[CLEARS THROAT]

I'm actually working
on a book, too.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Well, what's it about?
Well, it's a novel...

Uh-hmm.
...and, um,

it's about...
love and lust

and...

Stuff?
[BOTH LAUGHING]

Yeah, you know.

Good for you.
Good for you.

It's about
a lot of things.

Yeah.
Good, good, good.


Do you want to eat the
food before it gets cold?

Isn't that what
we're doing?

Oh. Mmm.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

Okay. Okay.

Food.

Yeah, food.

Oh, yeah.

You're putting
that up?

Yeah, yeah.
It's a good spot for it,

so why not, right?

Well, I mean,
look at it, Daniel.

It's a very...
sensual,

intimate photo.
Mm.

And it's not small.

Yeah. Okay.

It might give her
the wrong idea

if she comes
over here

and she sees that,
you know.

Uh, what wrong idea?
I don't...

There are no photos
like that of me up here.

I'm gonna have
to... you know,

get some photos like that...
at least one.

Come on, it's just a
gift, all right?

Maya is
a generous person.

Don't you like her?

Of course I do,
she's my friend.

I don't want to
see her get hurt.

[INTERCOM RINGING]

[SIGHS, CLEARS THROAT]

Hey, David.
DAVID: [OVER INTERCOM] <i>Pizza delivery.</i>

I'll ring you in
now, okay?

DAVID: Uh, yeah.
[ALL LAUGHING]

Did you know
that strawberries

are from Brittany,
France, originally?

Really?
I did not know that.

DANIEL: Yeah.

Can I play a song
for you guys?

VERONICA: Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

VERONICA: Over there, you can plug it in.
Okay.

Isn't he sexy?

Yeah.
Yeah.

[SLOW SULTRY MUSIC
PLAYING ON STEREO]

DAVID: Mm-hmm.

Oh.

Oh.

[ZIPPER UNZIPS]

[MOANS]
VERONICA: Mmm.

Oh, yeah.

I just wanna
watch, okay?

DAVID: Do you want
me to keep going?

Um... [HESITATES]

He just needs some
time, I think.

You just need
some time, right?

Yeah?

Uh...
Yeah?

[CLEARS THROAT]
You know,

I don't think this is a good time.
Sorry, I just...

[ZIPPER ZIPS]

He's never been with a guy before.
Mm.

It really turns me on
to see you with a man.

You understand
that, right?

Yeah. But I felt like
you were pressuring me.

Well, you were
really enjoying it

before you got all in
your head about it.

Uh, what about your friend Jasmine?
What about her?

She's hot.

So, maybe we could,
uh, you know...

Jasmine isn't taking
on any new lovers.

Well, she's not
the only option.

[CELL PHONE DINGS]
Well, neither are you.

David just invited
me over to continue,

if it's okay with you.

Sure.

You have
my blessing.

Okay.

[DAVID MOANS]

[BOTH MOANING]

I don't know.
I just need a little break.

Just a little break.

[BOTH SIGHING]

You okay?

[HORN BLARING]

VERONICA:
<i>Nice space.</i>

BENTON: <i>Yeah.</i> [CHUCKLES]
<i>Wow.</i>

So, we got an HBO writer
just down the hall.

That's Spike Lee's
assistant's office, yeah.

Oh, these are
the Barrys!

Barry R, Barry S.

You want to put a camera
on me and my partners?

We can work out
the approach.

How true to life
do you want it?

As true as
you want it to be.

You already have the
following with your blog,

this is gonna take you
on a whole other level.

Think about it, hmm?
[BREATHES DEEPLY]

VERONICA: <i>Although I had
reservations at first,</i>

<i>I can't edit what I do
or say like I do here.</i>

<i>My lovers gave me
their consent.</i>

<i>And besides, how could I
refuse to expand and inspire?</i>

<i>So, I'm going
on camera!</i>

<i>And I can't wait to
tell you all about it.</i>

BENTON: What's your
ideal poly relationship

or relationships?

Well, since
I'm bisexual,

I used to think
that, ideally,

I wanted one
male partner

and one
female partner,

and those relationships
would be equal.

Um, but now, well, more
recently, I've been feeling like

I ideally want a
primary relationship,

um, regardless
of gender.

And that,
with that person,

I would share,

well, we would
share, um,

you know, exploring
with other people.

And, um, because...

you know, I think
it's important

to have a solid
foundation with someone.

And it just seems easier to
have that with one person,

um, and then to...

you know,
and then build from there,

yeah, like a house.

You know, you have
the foundation

and then you want to add
the extensions later.

Yeah.

BENTON: What's the most
challenging part of being poly?

You know,
I was wondering if you...

The next time,
before you see Daniel...

Mm-hmm.
Um,

can you check in
with me?

Daniel is so...


I have to admit,

the first time,

it was just the pleasure
of being with someone

who intimately
knows you.

Huh.
Hmm, what?

Hmm, that,
um... [CHUCKLES]

You are so beautiful.
Okay.

I mean, is that a yes
to checking in?

You know,
Daniel is...

Yeah, he's amazing.

He's something.

I wasn't going to
say anything before,

but he is...

I don't think
he's ready for this.

And I know you guys
have a relationship,

I want to respect
those boundaries,

and I know he's your primary
partner, I get that.

that, I've settled with that,

I'm fine with that.
Uh-huh.

You understand?
You see it, right?

Um...

He has this, like,
baby in a candy store kinda thing.

Yeah.
It's kinda scary.

That doesn't
scare me.

No?
No.

You know,

my lover Chris is supposed
to come over later,

and I haven't seen
him in a few months.

So, I just want to
conserve my energy.

Yeah, I've been touring
so many different places.

Yeah.
Busy, busy, busy.

So, you understand, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, so, you want
me to go?

Thank you.

Um...

Okay.

Are you... You're okay?
Yeah, okay.

You sure?
Yeah.

Okay. You don't have
to go right now.

[URINE TRICKLING]


Do you mind?


Do you know how?

Here.
Uh, no idea.

Okay. Put your arm... Wait.

Put your arm
through there.

Um...

No.

Put your arm
through this one.

Put your
head through.

Yeah.

Uh...

There.

BOTH: Yeah.

Hey.
Hey, welcome.

[ALL EXCLAIM]
BENTON: Oh, ho-ho!

Look at you!
DANIEL: You like it?

Lookin' like a sexy,
Asian Satan.

DANIEL: I like that.
I'm getting nervous, man.

BENTON: It's a big night.
It's a big night!

[CLUB MUSIC PLAYING]

Hey, you guys look great.
You look great.

Okay, everyone.
Why don't we go around,

say your names and a
little bit about yourself?

So, who's starting?
JASMINE: I will.

Hi. I'm Jasmine.

I lost my virginity
in a threesome

and it was amazing!

<i>I was like,
"I don't wanna be a nun anymore."</i>

MAYA: The journey
to get to where I...

where I am now.
Oh, I'm nervous.

[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

Oh, Maya. Hi, I'm Maya.
Maya's my name.

Um,

I feel really grateful that
I got to choose this life.

You know,
whether I have one lover or five.

DANIEL: I had no idea
this world existed,

but I met Veronica
and she opened me up.

She helped me discover
that ethical non-monogamy

isn't just about swapping
partners or free love,

it's female driven,
generous and inclusive.

BENTON: All right, you're up, girl.
Come on, now. [LAUGHS]

Hi, I'm Veronica.

I don't know
why I'm here.

[ALL LAUGHING]
DANIEL: She's a funny one.

No matter how
careful you are,

someone always
ends up getting hurt.

JASMINE:
Ay, Veronica.

[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]

TEDDY: I'm Teddy.
I'm polyamorous,

and It works for me.

Hey, why didn't you
acknowledge me?

I'm here as
your partner.

May I?

BENTON: Oh!

[WHIP LANDS]
VERONICA: One.

Two.
[MAYA GRUNTS]

Three.
[MAYA GRUNTS]

Four.
[MAYA GRUNTS]

[WHIP LANDS]
VERONICA: Five.

[WHIPPING INTENSIFIES]
Six, seven, eight...

Okay, red.
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]

Nine, ten, eleven.
Red! Red! Hey!

MAN: Hey, hey, hey.
[CROWD MURMURING]

JASMINE: What's wrong with you?

What the hell was
that all about?

We were playing.
That was not playing.

[CROWD MURMURING]

<i>â™ª</i>

[VERONICA SOBS]

<i>â™ª</i>

Hey.

Oh. [LAUGHS]
You still got your...

Oh, yeah, yeah.

...smoky eyes.
Just haven't had any time

to get rid of it, so.

What is this place?

It was late and I
needed to be alone,

so Benton
hooked me up.

Yeah, it's unrented,
so he said I could crash here.

VERONICA: Mm-hmm.

Oh, are you hungry?

I just ordered this.

No.
DANIEL: Oh, I meant this.

Oh, no. Um, where's
the bathroom?

Ah, it's the first
door to your right.

You said you needed
to be alone.

[CLEARS THROAT] Yes...

but I met
someone else.

At Chemistry?

Uh, no, after.
She's sweet.

I've never been with
a sex worker before.

You paid her for sex?

Yeah, she's smart.

She's working her way
through college.

I have nothing
against sex workers,

but what the fuck,
Daniel?

What? You never said
it was out of bounds.

So, this is
my fault now?

I give you freedom and this
is what you do with it.

Well, I finally
have freedom,

and now you want to take it away.
No.

Yeah, that's what
you're doing right now.

VERONICA: No!

But monogamy is obsolete, okay?
You know that.

No, I never, I never said that.
I never said that.

You're not saying that,
but that's what you're doing, okay?

Monogamy is obsolete.

Polyamory is the future.
What?

This, this is not poly.

This... There are
no boundaries here.

Where are
the boundaries?

Boundaries?
What about compersion?

What... What...
Compersion? Fuck compersion!

What you did to Maya...
Maya?

Maya. What I did to
Maya was not cool,

but, but that...
Mm-hmm.

Look, she was not being my
friend, okay?

And that has nothing to do
with you and me right now.

I love you.

I do, too.

Okay.

Hey...


I'm sorry. Just look...
Don't touch me!


Look, I can give you
threesomes and parties

and...

we can do
things together.

We can have
all of that

if you could just...
love me.

[DOOR CLOSES]

Yeah, I mean,
for me...

like, with all
my poly experience,

I've never...
let go of...

my romantic
view of love.

Is it possible
to love...

like, openly,
totally openly

and with
vulnerability

and with
abandon...

when you have
multiple lovers, I...

sometimes I think,
yes, of course,

<i>but other times,
I'm not so sure.</i>

Which is why I think polyamory
is just as fucked up as monogamy.

[BENTON CHUCKLES]

You are the most engaging...
[VOICE DROWNS OUT]

[BREATHING DEEPLY]


[MOANS SOFTLY]

[EXHALES DEEPLY]

DANIEL: Hi.
Hey.

How are you?

Good.

Mmm, Daniel,

I've never been disappointed
in your cooking.

There you go.

BOTH: So, how's the...
DANIEL: ...book?

Killin' it.

Book is going well.

Yeah, it's, um...

I realized
sometimes it...

it...

A story needs
separation

from the thing
that inspired it...

to start to really
make sense.

Yeah.

Do you still
go to parties?

Oh, not as often.

Um, I'm dating someone
now, actually.

Do I know her?

No.

But I think you'd
like her, though.

How's it working out?

We're really happy.

Uh...

Yeah.
I go to the city when I can,

and she comes up here
a couple of times.

VERONICA: Hmm.

You have someone.

but she's married.

And it'll never go
beyond what we...

You...

you were married when we
met, remember?

Would you ever...

[CLEARS THROAT] ...under
the right circumstances,

want to try
again with me?

What circumstances?

You and I were never really a
couple, Daniel. We...

There was always
something or someone...

between us.

Besides, um...

I'm seeing
someone, too.

She's a writer
from New York,

loves cats.
