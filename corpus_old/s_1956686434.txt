[gate buzzing]

[indistinct announcement on PA]

What do you say, Spense?

Hey, Squeeb.
[grunts]

Hey, new little fun fact for you.

You know, Saguaro cactus
lives for over 150 years?

Now, you cut one down in Arizona,

you can do a year in prison. Imagine that?

Shit. [chuckles]

I know guys that rob people in here

doin' less time than that.
[chuckling] Right?

How does it feel gettin' out?

I haven't slept in a few nights.
But other than that...

How you doin', Squeeb? How you feelin'?

I feel like a lifer.

You know, a lot of guys feel that way.

But you're different.

How many cops get to do
their time in gen pop?

Zero.

I can't think of one.

But, I mean, that's probably why
you're so popular in here.

I'm popular? Wow, I had no idea.

when you get out?


Yeah. Go to Fenway Park,

you know, get a big-ass, juicy rib eye.

You got a girl, right?

I got a girl. Her name is Pearl.

Yeah, I'm probably just gonna
lay down in my bed

and let her lick me all over.

Pearl. Sounds like an old lady's name, no?

You know, she's a little older.
She makes up for it in loyalty.

'Sup, bookworm?

Not much.

How's Aryan Nation treatin' everybody?

State of the Union still strong? [scoffs]

You know, we just wanna
let you know how important it is

that you're gettin' out of Boston
and never comin' back,

drivin' a truck
or doin' whatever the hell you're doin'.

Yeah, we have a little, uh,
goin' away message for you.

For me?

Well, can't be from the guys in here.

They like me, right?

So, who's sending the message?

Fuck 'em up, Spenser.

["Foreplay/Long Time" playing]

[men groaning]

<i>â™ª It's been such a long time â™ª</i>

All right, come on.

[both grunt]

Did you just kick me, bro?



Why you gotta kick me, bro?

[both grunting]


<i>â™ª I've got to keep on
Chasin' a dream, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've gotta be on my way â™ª</i>


All right, all right, hold on!

Spense. [chuckles]


Got ya. [chuckles]

[Spenser grunts]

You're lucky it was self-defense, Spenser.

<i>â™ª Well, I'm takin' my time
I'm just movin' on â™ª</i>


Your fingerprints are
the only unique thing about you, shitbag.

Seriously? You said that five years ago
when I got here.

Why don't you get some new material?

I'll see you in about a month or less.
Have a nice day.

Hey, you wanna do me a favor
when you start that truck driving class?

Tell my Aunt Betty I said,
"Go fuck your sister."

You got a very weird family,
don't you, Lenny?

<i>â™ª Well, I'm takin' my time
I'm just movin' along â™ª</i>

[breathes deeply]


Nice out here, huh?
[sighs]

Take a minute, enjoy it.

Try and stay on this side for a while.

Wow. Riviera hasn't aged a day.
You gonna let me drive?

You remember how?

[engine revs]

Oh, shit! Get in the car! Hurry up!

Why? What's up? Why?
Come on, I don't want her to see me.

Hurry up! Come on, let's go!

What are you doing?
She drove all this way to see you.


[Spenser] Hey!
[thuds]

Why can't you just stay out of
other people's businesses, huh?

How do you like that?

I love you!

I love you so fuckin' much!

Shit.



[guard] Oh, the other side.
What are we doin'? You...

Shut up! I'm not ready to see her yet.

all this way to see you.


Heart made of granite 'cause
I find out from someone at the car wash

that he got out of prison today?

Ma'am, I can't help you with that.
No?


All right, Shawshank.
I'll move my fuckin' car.

Fuck!


I'm gonna kill him.

What's up, Driscoll?

[laughing] Spenser. Come here.
What's up?


I'm sorry I couldn't visit you
more at Walpole, brother.

Look, I'm glad you came up.

And I really appreciate
you sendin' me the books. It's all good.

I brought you a gift.

Donuts?
I wanna keep you on your toes.

Hey.
[Driscoll chuckling]

Impressive how you did your time.

As a former police officer,

I was very, very popular in there.
That's for sure.

Man. So, what's next?
That's the big question.

Look, I'm gettin outta here, you know?

There ain't shit for me here.
I'm gonna drive a semi, you know?

Look at sunsets. Shit like that.

Ah, maybe it's for the best.

There's still a lot of cops around here
who'd love to put a mark on you.

Well, I get in a hassle,
I know who to call.

That's fuckin' right.

All right, man, welcome home, brother.

I love you. Nice to see you, brother.

How you doin' today, Mr. Cimoli?

I'm good.

Say hi to Irene and the boys.
You got it.

Let's go see your girlfriend.


Pearly, baby. Hey.

Pearly.

Henry, she won't even look at me.

She gave me the cold shoulder.

Baby, I'm sorry that I was gone.
I know five years is way too long.

Thirty-five years from her perspective.

No more cold winters for you.

You're gonna keep your
little paws in the desert,

you're gonna chase little
bunny rabbits in the sand. Huh?

There's no bunny rabbits in Arizona.

They got snakes and scorpions.
She wouldn't last a week.

You gotta shut the fuck up, okay?

I'm just tryin' to have a moment here

and apologize
for my absence to my baby girl.

We're gonna go to Arizona, all right?

I'm gonna drive a truck
and I'm never gonna let you go.

I'll have one hand on the wheel
and the other hand on you.

We'll put a little bed
right beside my chair.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[Pearl whining]

Baby, you got the breath.

Didn't I tell you to buy the Greenies?

You didn't get her

Yo!

Henry!

What?
You said I had my own room.

Hawk, this is Spenser.
Spenser, this is Hawk.

You two are gonna be roommates.

Toilets are flushed at all times.

Food is labelled.

No fighting in the house

Now, I'd like you two

When I get there, I'll read what you have

I really do.

Terrence!



Oh, my God, somebody help me.


Terrence!

Terry!

Are you fuckin' with me? Are you?

[continues crying]

Hey. He snores.

What happened here?

Oh, a little going away present.


Don't eat anything on the right side
of the fridge. It belongs to Hawk.

Aw, do you got any real food?

The rest is his.

Where's the giant?

Gets up at five, starts running.

We got no milk.

There's some oatmeal milk in there,
but it belongs to Hawk.

Oat milk? What the fuck is that?

Who knows? All I know is
he drinks it all the time.

What? Do you have to put somethin' in it?

Well, what would you put in it?

I don't know, Henry. Take a wild guess.

Maybe water or milk or somethin'.

If you put milk in it,
you might as well use milk.

<i>It's been confirmed that the victim
is Boston Police Captain John Boylan.</i>

<i>Unofficial sources have described it
as an execution-style killing.</i>

<i>No arrests have been made.</i>

<i>- Back to you in the studio.</i>
Holy shit.

[reporter 2] <i>Thank you for that.
There is a city-wide manhunt...</i>

Jesus Christ. Somebody killed Boylan?

Was it you?

<i>Police are being tight-lipped
on the case so far,</i>

<i>but witnesses say
they saw a dark blue SUV...</i>

Son of a bitch,
they finally killed Boylan.

[doorbell rings]

You wanna guess who that could be?

I can see 'em.

That's pretty quick, huh?
Yeah.

Wow.

Well, this is a surprise.

Yeah. Sorry, Spense, I gotta ask you.

Where were you last night?

You know how it is.

Captain Boylan dies
the same night that you get out.

You're on the top of the suspect list.

He was right here. I tucked him in myself.

Not only that, he's got a roommate
that was sleepin' ten feet away from him.

That's more like three feet,
Henry, but thank you very much.

All right.
An alibi's a beautiful thing. Let's go.

[detective] That's it?
Yep.

If it turns out I like you for this,

the DA will pop the old guy's story
like a balloon.

John Boylan was a good cop.

You should tell that to Mrs. Boylan.

At least with him dead,
she can stay out of the emergency room.

Help me help you.
You know what, big mouth?

I graduated the Academy
two years after you did.

And I work Homicide.

I wear a suit and carry a gold shield.

Who the hell are you?

Nothing.
Okay, let's go.

An ex-con. I'm livin' your dream life,
you piece of shit.


Man's got an alibi. Let's go.


[Driscoll sighs]

Sorry, Spense. You're on the list.

This Boylan thing...
It's, uh... It's a problem.

It's a real problem.
You're lucky you're going to Arizona.

Wish I was goin' with you, man. Shit.

Say hi to that cactus for me.

Get in the car, man. It's over. Stop.

Shit.

Okay. I'm sorry about that.

Yeah.
Beautiful truck.


First rule in this class
is to take everything you've learned

about being in a four-wheeler
and flush it down the toilet.

Your hands and feet are in charge
of 80,000 pounds of fast moving steel

and you must be the smartest person
on the road at all times.

You need to be awake,
you need to be alert and in charge.

You mess up, and a mini-van
with three sleeping kids,

and they get flattened like a pancake.

And nowadays, there are all
these cameras everywhere.

You're not gonna get away with it.

Now let's get to today's lesson, okay?

Any questions?

Any questions? Any questions?

Hey.

How many times?
Like 22 times.

[phone ringing]
Twenty-three times.

I'm not here, okay?

He's not here.

Quit fuckin' around.
I want you to take a look at Hawk.


This kid is raw,
but I think he's got a lot of talent.

I think he could be somethin' special.

[alarm beeps]
[referee] Time!

You punch like a bitch.
What the fuck? [yells]

[referee] Hey! Time! Time!
[Hawk] Say that fuckin' shit again!

Hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up!

Get him outta there!

Get him outta there!

Get him the hell outta here! Out, out!



Hey. You're a fighter, all right?

You gotta be able to control yourself.

Henry, this guy doesn't
even know how to throw a punch.

You hear him?
Haven't I been tellin' you that?

That you don't know
how to throw a punch?

in the fuckin'...

There'll be no kicking
till you learn how to punch.

He's gonna teach you.

[Spenser] I'm not workin' with him.
[Henry] Yeah, you are.

[Spenser] I'm not. No.
[Henry] You are.

I want you to work with me.
I'm not doing it.

I'm asking you to do it.
I don't give a shit.

One, two.

Hey, hey. Just punch, all right?

Keep your feet on the ground.

Throw a hook. Let me see a hook.

Uppercut.

Oh, my God.

All right, no, no.

Dude, stop, stop.

Hips. You gotta turn the hips,
all right? Turn the hips.

Boom. Turn, turn, turn.

Turn. Turn.
Like that?

Yeah. You don't need muscle
to knock somebody out.

Incoming. Incoming!


["Mississippi Queen" playing]

<i>â™ª Mississippi Queen â™ª</i>

Oh, shit.

I waited all this time.
I gotta come find you here?

Can we talk over here for a sec...

Just come and talk with me
for a second, please?

you are gonna listen.

Don't keep backin' me up, okay? I...
You don't like it?

You don't like the way this feels?

so much, you come here.

each other like fuckin' gorillas.

I'm in here working.
I'm tryin' to better my life. That's it.

And you stopped coming to see me.

What's the problem?
I thought you moved on.

You were in prison!

What was I supposed to do? Wait?
Yeah.

With no ring?

Goin' up there every week
so we could have riveting conversations,

like, how much I missed your cock?

No, I just figured you moved on.

What you're calling "move on"
is me just living.

I am a very successful...

Keep turning your hips, bro.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

I'm a very successful
small business owner.

People line up around
the block to work with me.

I got poodles comin' out of my ass.
Everybody wants to work...

[over speakers] Excuse me,
Miss Davis. Spenser's working.

Maybe you could talk to him later?

What? Are you his bodyguard now?
It's okay.

Look, look. Look at me.
Look at me. Listen, okay?

I'm sorry. All right? I am. I mean it.

You are incapable of real intimacy.

And I came here to tell you
I never wanna see you again.

You're gonna be in Arizona,

Mrs. Graham?

Mrs. Graham!

Hey. Sorry...
No, I didn't mean to scare you.

What do you want?
Sorry about that. I, uh...

Look... [sighs]

I was, um... I was a friend of Terrence.

I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.

Who are you?

Uh, my name is Spenser. I don't know
if Terrence told you about me.

Um, I got into a situation
years ago with John Boylan.

It sent me to prison for quite some time.

That was you?

Yeah. I just thought maybe
I could help you in some way.

Help, how?

Uh, I don't know, find the truth?

Did your husband
have any problems with Boylan?

Boylan was a loudmouth

whose ego could fill a room.

You know, old school,

above the law cop
who liked to flaunt his power.

Yeah, that's Boylan to a T.

"altar boy." [chuckles]

Did Terrence have the technical knowledge
to disable the airbag in your vehicle?

Why?

Well, because you can't use a vehicle as
a ram unless you can disable the airbags.

Mmm-mmm. They didn't ask me that.
Why didn't they ask me that?

Because they already know the answer.

They found drugs in our home.

[knocking on door]
[cop 1] Mrs. Graham, we got a warrant.

Said he was dealing.</i>

to look, didn't they?</i>

[cop 2] Check this wall.


[cop 3] Jackpot.

[cop 4] Look what we got here,
Mrs. Graham.

Your husband was dealing narcotics.

[Letitia crying] <i>And they said
they could pin me for conspiracy</i>

and take my boy away.

Well, believe them, okay?
They can and they will.

When is the last time
you saw your husband?

The night before?

Terrence said he had to meet his partner.

Um, Scott Traylor?

And they... They went to some cop bar.

SlÃ¡inte?

Yeah.

I know who Scott Traylor is.

I'll dig up anything I can,
see if it helps.

[breathes shakily] And this...

This revenge for you?
No.

My mom wasn't dealt a good hand either.

But she was fierce, tough,
and she had a lot of heart.

I got a lot of flaws, Mrs. Graham.
Believe me, a lot.

But anything I got good in me,
it came from her.

Sounds like she was a good woman.

Keep an eye on your son.
I'll be in touch, okay?

Terrence Graham's partner?

Who are you?

I know Terrence didn't do
what they're pinning on him.

I'm gonna go take a piss. Come see me.

[music continues playing faintly]

You know, it hit me who you are.

A lot of guys in this bar,
they celebrated when you got locked up.

You and I both know
Terrence was not a crooked cop.

Was he in this bar
the night Boylan was killed, yes or no?


And did he suspect Boylan
of bein' a dirty cop?


Huh?


Unbelievable. How was Walpole?

Did you work your way right up
to the honeymoon suite?

Wow, Patrolman Macklin.

Hear how heavy you guys
are breathin' from walkin' 50 steps?

What the hell are you doin' here?

This isn't a bar for boy scouts.

Well, I said something
insensitive to this young man

who recently lost his partner

and I think you guys just saved me
an ass kicking, so thank you.

He didn't do nothin'. He apologized.

Yeah? Did you apologize
for beatin' down your own captain?



The set of balls on you.

I don't know if you noticed it,
but it's Sergeant Macklin now.

Wow. [chuckling]
For you to be a sergeant,

I'd say all your superiors
must be dead, no?

That's impossible. So, what was it?

A clerical error
or they just get a tax break

hiring a mentally stunted
dickhead like yourself?

Jesus, you are a prick.

Thank you. [groans]

[groans]
[Macklin chuckles]

Aah! Bad mother...

[breathes deeply] Oh, that was good.

That was good. That was real good.

Come on already, will you?

[cops grunting]

[cop 1] We're gonna cut those out.

Shit! Fuck.



Get the fuck out of Massachusetts.

You fuckin' hear me, Spenser? You're done.

See you later.

I need to use your bathroom.
Customers only.

Fine. Here.

Now it's official. Give me the key.

There. It's down the hall, to the right.


What are you doing?

I just need the tape from your cameras.
From the other day.

Oh, it's not a tape.

Well, I need this hard drive!

That's the cable box.

What?
That's the cable box.

Where's the hard drive?

How do you get the footage
from the cameras?

They're in the cloud.

What the fuck is a cloud?

The cloud. Yeah...
Listen, dude...


Don't play with me right now.
Give me the cloud.

Ooh, I thought you knew how to punch.

There was four of them. Okay?
You good?

Oh, no, no. I'm not good.

I don't know how to work
this computer shit.

Sit down, will you?

Come on, please.

Thank you.
[typing]

Let me look at the top right camera.

That's Terrence Graham's car.
It was used in the Boylan hit.

Let's see what happens when he comes out.

There he is.

All right, hold on.

Who are you meeting, Terrence?



It's too blurry. Shit!

It means you're looking
for a fat, old, white dude

with three divorces and a micro-dick.


Who else you think drives
a Corvette like that?

Go back to the other camera.
Now, fast forward.

Wait, wait, wait. Zoom in a little more.

Let me see.

So, they all left together.

who those guys are?

but I know where they went.

One, two! One, two!

Come on! Stick and move.
Stick and move. Stick and move.

One, two, one, two.

That's it. Move, move it.
That's it. Come on.

Punch it.

[timer beeps]
Time.

that right hand after he throws it.

What the hell are you doing here?

You thinkin' of leavin' Cimoli's?

No, look, I wanted to ask you
a few questions about Terrence Graham.

Man, anything seem off to you about it?

Yeah. The fact that
you're askin' me about it.

What are you,
a private detective now, huh?

Is that what's goin' on here?

'Cause I was under the impression that

a convicted felon can't get a license.
[chuckles]

With your connections,
I could probably get a pardon.


Listen, let this one go.

Graham's dirty, drugs in his house.

Look, they said that Boylan
was killed in the school bus yard, right?

And that Terrence Graham
rammed him first with his SUV?

That's how he got the drop on him.

Yeah, but they found his SUV
outside of his house.

Then he drove himself home
and blew his brains out.

You don't have
to be Sherlock Holmes here...

No, the air bags should've went off.

He wouldn't have been
able to drive it at all.

Well, he must've disabled 'em.

Yeah, but it doesn't add up.
Why drive all the way home?

To shoot himself?

Run the risk of his kid walkin' out
and seein' him dead in the car?

Spenser, the man was not
in his right mind.

And what about the crime scene?

Everything added up, right?

Beats me. I haven't been there.

You haven't been there?

What do you mean you haven't been there?

No, I haven't been there.

Spenser, why would I go there?
The case is closed.

You're home, baby.
Let it go. Let it go, man.

The only thing that it's gonna bring you
is grief, pain, frustration.

Let it go.

[timer beeping]

I gotta get back to work,
I ain't gettin' no younger.

All right. He's right,
I'm keepin' my right hand too low.

One, two! One, two!

into the brutal double homicide</i>

<i>that has rocked the city
of Boston continues today.</i>

<i>We're hearing inside
the Boston Police Department,</i>

<i>that Officer Terrence Graham
lured Captain Boylan</i>

<i>to an isolated city school bus yard
where he killed him violently.</i>

<i>It is believed Terrence Graham
is the only suspect.</i>


Oh, you see that? You gotta be
able to move, all right?

Defense is the best offense sometimes. Go.


Do I get a shot
at drivin' the Black Betty?

You're not ready, Mr. Spenser.

Well, uh, she sure is a pretty truck.

[breathes heavily]
[Spenser] There you go.

Yeah. Okay. Get in.

[breathes heavily]

Now, block. Good.

[exhales]
And block, block, block.

Oh, you see that?
Yeah.

You have to listen. All right? Yeah.

are planning a funeral</i>

<i>to honor the fallen Captain Boylan</i>

<i>and will announce details shortly.</i>


I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
You want somethin'?

Thank you.
For what?

The boxing. You're right, I need it.

I'm just doin' what Henry asked me to do.

Got one Green Goddess for the gentleman.

Gonna like this a lot more than
prison food, I guarantee you.

I don't know about that.
What'd you go up for?

Manslaughter.

Reduced from murder one.

Served four years, out on good behavior.

And now, thanks to Henry,
I'm changin' my life.


I wanna be the LeBron James of MMA.

Really?
Yeah.

Wow. Yeah, that's impressive.

I'm gonna use my gifts to make
a difference in the world

like my dad would've wanted.

Your dad, huh?

What was he like?

He was a good guy. Military man, pilot.

Man of the world type, you know?

We moved around a lot.
Settled in New Orleans.

He witnessed some real
messed up shit in our community.

Everybody told him to look the other way.

He couldn't.

He died, a hero.

Not minding his own business.

And what happened?

I'm not gonna get into that, not with you.

Probably not ever, actually.
Fair enough.

I'm gonna go wash my hands.



Hey, what are you doin'?

You followin' me?

Uh, I came to the bathroom first.

You followed me in here.
So, you're following me.

What are you doin' in this restaurant?

I came to meet a friend.

What are you doin'?
Hmm.

Don't be ridiculous, okay?
Don't be ridiculous.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

Don't! You know what? You...
What?

We're not doing... [sighs]

We're not doing this today.
We're not doin' what?

Oh, we're just gonna go.

You're the one putting your hands on me.

I'm just guiding you back to the door...
Guiding me?

Where do you wanna guide me?
You're blocking my path.

You locked the door.
Where do you wanna guide me?

[Spenser] Stop that.
You're the one pushin' me.

What are you, the lock police?

All right, you look good.
What do you want from me?

I want a lot from you,
'cause guess what? You look good, too.

No, you look really good.

Yeah? So why don't you
do somethin' about it?

How about this?
Huh? You like this?

Don't touch my fuckin' hair.
All right.

You know how I get about my hair.

I know what you like. Come here.
You wanna show me?

Yes? All right.
Yeah. All right. I got you.

[Cissy moans] Stop, stop.

[breathes heavily]

Yeah?
Yeah.

Like that?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [moans]

[both breathing heavily]

Oh, shit! Okay! Okay! Okay! [grunts]

Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

Don't you dare
fuckin' cum before me. Okay?


Cissy always finishes first!


Fuck! Fuck!
Was that it?

Go, Sox!

Don't stop! Don't stop!

Don't stop!
Oh, shit!

Oh, my fuckin' God!
Shut up!

Oh, my fuckin' God!

[moans]
[both panting]

We're in the window right now, Spenser.

What's that?
Remember the window?

You mean the five minutes
of peace between us

right after we have sex? Yeah.

Yeah, lasts about as long as sex with you.

Get off me.
Yeah.


Used to be my favorite part of the day.

Even better than fuckin'. [sniffles]

Well, you seem like you liked it.

What, you wanna go again?
[toilet flushes]


That time we thought I was pregnant.

Do you remember what you said to me?
Um, I remember the gist.

You said,

"I'm not sayin' we're gettin' married,

but that kid's not gonna
be raised without a father."

You remember that?

It was a false alarm, thank God.

But you were gonna do what was right.

You always had that strong moral code.

I'm movin' to Arizona.

I'm gonna start over. Start fresh.

That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

This is your home.

before you ever touch me again.

[door opens]

You got, um... You got a little
stain on your dress there.

Just sayin'.

Souvenir.

Mind your business.

Okay. I'll mind my business.

Is that yellow Corvette my business?

Shit!

No, I'm just cutting through.

No, no! Stay! Stop!

I got another one.
Fine. Enough.

I have the money you requested

You... can... just...

Irish mob throwback.

Back when the Irish mob existed
outside all those shitty movies.


Nice.

I think it's time you tell me
what's really goin' on here.

There was a girl named Gloria Weisnewski.

I used to shovel snow off
her mother's porch in Southie.

She was a smart kid.
I watched her grow up.

When developers came to Southie,

gentrifying and trying to destroy
the soul of the city,

<i>she couldn't look the other way.</i>

We can keep on marching!

[chanting indistinctly]

Where does Tracksuit Charlie come in?

Tracksuit Charlie was
and is a goon for hire.

<i>Somebody paid him to harass Gloria,
get her to give up.</i>

You shut your mouth!
[Gloria shouting indistinctly]

Get your filthy,
stinkin' hands out my face!

Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you!

Then it escalated.

<i>Phone calls, threats, harassment.</i>

<i>Next thing you know, Gloria comes home
and finds her cat nailed to the door.</i>


It didn't take a genius to know

<i>that it was Tracksuit Charlie
that killed Gloria's cat.</i>

Couple of weeks later,
I was out on a call.

Manager at Cumberland Farms

<i>had a suspicious vehicle
in the parking lot.</i>

There was blood leaking from the trunk.

[inhales sharply] We got a...

<i>I had to tell her mother.</i>

<i>It was almost worse than finding the body.</i>

[woman sobbing]
I got you.

[Spenser sighs]

I don't know,
I was so close to the family.

They were good, honest people,
so I just kept checkin' in.

Got handed over to Homicide.

But I couldn't let it go.

<i>When I followed up on Gloria's case,</i>

<i>I found out Homicide
was just sittin' on it.</i>

<i>They hadn't even questioned
Tracksuit Charlie.</i>

Lieutenant.
Sergeant, what are you doing here?

I need to speak with you
outside for a minute.

We're in the middle of somethin'.

This is very important.

It's in your best interest
that you step outside and talk to me.

I will actually judge
what's in my best interest

and you need to start thinking
about what's your best interest.

Sergeant, get your ass outta here.
You get out of here now.

We're in the middle of something.

investigating Gloria Weisnewski's murder?

'Cause you should be,
but you're burying it. Why?

I think you should step outside
and mind your step, son.

Really?
Yeah, you really do.

Listen...

Don't touch me. Don't touch me, okay?

Wake up!
Get out of here.

Get him outta here!
[officer] Let's go.

but I knew he was covering something up.</i>

Get out, you piece of shit.

from this reporter at the <i>Globe,</i>

<i>and he wants to show me
this very graphic tape.</i>

Has Homicide seen this tape?

Yeah, a secretary leaked it to me.

It's Gloria Weisnewski.

Word is, those animals were part
of the Trinitario drug gang.

They haven't even questioned
the guys workin' the lot yet.

What?
You wanna hear the extent of the sandbag?

<i>Globe's</i> not gonna run it.
They're putting me on another story.

So what're they hiding?
I was hoping you could tell me that.

This is fucked up, man.

Tracksuit must have put them on it.

Fuckin' Boylan.

Hey, one flash behind.

One flash behind you, baby.

[knocking at door]

What are you doing here?

I have some urgent questions
for you, John.

Jesus. Just walk right in. What questions?

Know Wayne Cosgrove,
reporter for the Globe?

No, I don't know who that is.

He showed me the tape.

What tape?
The tape of Gloria Weisnewski

being murdered in the parking lot.

The tape that you are burying.

What tape? I don't know
what you're talking about.

Don't play stupid with me.
I'm not playing stupid.

Not in your own home.
Don't talk to me like that in my house!

Are you drunk right now?
It doesn't matter.

It's eight o'clock on a Saturday morning.


Get the fuck out of our house!

What happened to your wife's face, John?

That is just... no way...

What? Did you hit her with that...

You're a filthy cop.

You beat that...

[grunts]
[Mrs. Boylan] Fuckin' hell!

Shit.


[Boylan groaning]

[Mrs. Boylan] Get off of him!

Get off of him, you son of a bitch.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[indistinct shouting]

[Mrs. Boylan] Get off of him!

Get off of him!

[Mrs. Boylan grunting]

That fucker over there killed a cat?

So, the cat is what you're
takin' away from all of this?


We're gonna blow this whole shit open.

Clear Terrence's name,
take these guys down.

You want in?
Man, I'm already in.

for something, Officer?

I'm just a concerned citizen now.

Doing a little private investigating?

with the title yet for what I'm doing.

Let me know if you hear anything
germane to my investigation.

What investigation is that,
uh, Agent Louisa Burton?

Use your imagination.

You're the guy that got arrested
for assaulting John Boylan.

That's who you are.

Gosh, damn it, that's who he is.

[wheezing laugh]

Wow. Your partner's wound
a little tight, huh?

You know, no offense, but two
top-dollar Feds tailing a dirty cop?

to fuckin' deserve this shit detail?

See you later, all right?

<i>They play some big abstract game,</i>

<i>a big fish, which they never do.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, all the victims, the innocents,</i>

the Terrence Grahams of the world...
[Hawk] Hmm.

...they fall through the cracks. Right?

There's zero justice, ever.

So, where are we?

We got Trinitarios, deal makin' FBI.

Yeah.

And we got some
very corrupt cops covering something up.

[sighs]
Well, maybe killing Boylan was a message.

I know who we gotta go see.

[indistinct chatter]

What the fuck do you want?

You know that hit you tried on me?

Who wanted that? [smacks lips]

Why is the FBI tailing dirty cops?

What's going on in the city?

I don't have anything to say to you.

I figured you'd say that. [chuckles]

Do you like movies, Squeeb?

I got friends in here.
I was able to bring in my phone.

Henry, we're live.

I don't know if I have this right.</i>

The fuck is that?

[Henry] <i>For Christ's sake. I got it...</i>
Move your face away from the camera.

Yeah. Henry.
<i>- What?</i>

Move your face away from the camera.

<i>- You got video?</i>
Yes.

<i>Are we really doing this?</i>

Yes. Now.

Recognize her?

Hey, is that my wife?

It ain't mine.

Hey, what the fuck?

How long has it been, huh?
How long you been in here?

How long has it been
since she's had some real attention?

You see that handsome gentleman there?

He met her in a supermarket.

He asked her if she wanted
to have a drink, she said yes.

Look how she's dressed.
Fuck you!


Three in the afternoon,
she's dressed up like that? Wow.

And you know what she had to do?
She had to get a babysitter.

That's a weird time
to get a babysitter, huh?

What are all the Aryan brothers
gonna say about that?

You better hurry up, Squeeb.
She's already had four drinks.

Fuck you. What the fuck do you want?

I want answers, okay?

Tell your friend to leave Suzie alone.

Henry, tell Hawk to walk away.

Hey, Romeo, get outta there.</i>


I know you know things, Squeeb.
You got ears on the street.

What happened to Boylan? Hmm?

Who ordered the hit on me on my last day?

I'll give you one word, man,
one word only.

Well, it better be a good word, <i>amigo.</i>

Wonderland.

What, you mean the dog track?


What are you smiling at, Squeeb?

I just keep imagining your head
rolling down the sidewalk.




Come on out.

Where are you?

Wonderland.

They're building a casino there.

It's gonna have the GNP
of a small oil-rich nation.

[Spenser] <i>And it's corrupt?</i>
[Cosgrove] <i>Well, yeah.</i>

<i>I mean, ever heard of
an honest outfit running a casino?</i>

<i>I mean, they are, by design,
instruments of corruption.</i>

If I was still a crime reporter
and I wanted to get my head chopped off,

<i>I'd be writing about
the connection between some dirty cops</i>

<i>and some big politicians
using the Trinitario drug trade</i>

<i>to get a seat at the table of Wonderland.</i>

It's like some fuckin' evil partnership.

It's got a name.

Los Oscuros. Huh? The Dark.

Cosgrove, if you know all this,

why don't you just go public
with what you have?

Because the Wonderland syndicate
has got enough money

<i>to bury anything I put out there.</i>

<i>All right, picture this.</i>

<i>Real bad cops, Dominican street gangs,</i>

<i>and some of the dirtiest
investors in the game,</i>

<i>all working together</i>

<i>to build the next
great family-friendly resort destination</i>

<i>for degenerate gamblers.</i>



I don't even know what that looks like.

It would have to be some fuckin' visual
to poke through this fake news bullshit.

I'll tell you that. Okay? So, we done now?

Because, honestly,
this is the kind of conversation

where a little red sniper dot
pops up on my forehead.


[Spenser] What's up?
Hey, you can't be here.

is this private property?

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see a sign.

I used to come here
as a kid all the time with my grandfather.

I thought it was reopening.
I was hoping to see some dog races.

Nah, no dogs in Massachusetts
for 20 years.

Oh, no, that's simply not true.

I see dogs all the time in Massachusetts.

In fact, I have one.

Look at that. Her name's Pearl, huh?

What a queen.
I named her after my grandma.

Now you gotta get outta here.
Okay.

Come on.
All right. I'm sorry about that.

Have a good one, guys.

until, one day, a feral cat
starts eating the mice.

<i>to figure out what to do

So, one of the younger mice speaks up.

"That is an excellent idea,

So, what do we do, then?

Man, you get beat up a lot.

And I've noticed every single time
you get your face pushed in,

you come back with just
a little bit more information.

Would you stop?
I'm just saying.

I don't think it's a very good tactic.

They know who I am now.

No shit!
They're gonna know where to find me.

They're gonna
come looking for me at Henry's.

They'll find Henry at Henry's.

Shit!

I hope you brought towels.
This isn't a Motel Six.

Hey. We're here two days, four days max.

It's not safe at Henry's.
Nobody's gonna look for us here.

Who won't look for you here?

Law enforcement. Trinitarios.

Oh, the good guys and the bad guys.

That makes me feel much better.

It's also repetitive behavior.

Hi. [kisses]
Spenser.

[dogs barking]
[Hawk] Is this your house or a kennel?

I board dogs and I am...

Come here.

And I am very successful at it, all right?

What did you expect? Punching bags?

A bunch of grown men kicking
each other in the fuckin' neck?

Go to Henry's for that.
[Spenser] Hey.

Leave my business out of it.
I expected more from you.

You're supposed to be his mentor.

Create an atmosphere of
responsible thought and action.

Instead, you got two grown men
runnin' around playing Batman.

We're not playing Batman, okay?

This is Batman business all the way.

Got you and big boy over here

I am not Robin.



You are an enabling Alfred.

You gave him the keys to the Batmobile.

The Riv is not the Batmobile.

Well, it serves the same purpose.

Are we really gonna stay here?

Because I'd rather take my chances
with the Trinitarios.

At least they don't talk so much.

No. Because they're too busy
trying to shoot you.

You know, actually, they prefer machetes.

Well, they're angry.

Okay, well, I feel so much better now.

So, I'm just gonna go.

Let's go, boys.

Snowball, Rosco, Smokey. Let's go.

[dogs barking and panting]

[dog toy squeaking]


[line ringing]

Spenser?

Did you call the police?

No.

And why would I? They probably did this.


Hey.

Are you a giant?

Yeah.

Are you a good one or a bad one?

I'm a good one.

Can you pull my bed over?

I think I could handle that.

I want you to put the pillow on the bed.

Can you do that?

Both pillows.

Where would Terrence keep something
if he didn't want anybody to find it?

I don't know.

Well, do you have any idea
what they were looking for?

What?

Do you know what they were looking for?

No, I don't.

Why are you doing this?

'Cause it's the right thing to do.

[Letitia sniffles]

Terrence...

mailed this to me the day he died.


It's a wire.

I know what it is.


I don't know how.

I do.


You have some place you can stay?
No.

We're not goin' anywhere.

I'm not getting chased out of my own home.

Well, good for you.

All right, look.

I'm gonna call you
when I know something, okay?

Thank you.
[Spenser] Okay.

Can I hold on to this?



All right. I'll call you soon. Come on.

[Terrence on recording] <i>Come on, Boylan.</i>

<i>We both want to get home
to our families. Help me out.</i>

how deep this shit goes.</i>

[Terrence sighs] <i>So, tell me.</i>

is way above my pay grade, Mr. Altar Boy.</i>

<i>But high up.</i>

<i>High up.</i>

All right, Los Oscuros is just
one seat at this fuckin' table.

Oh, come on.

The Feds.

Give me something good
to whet their appetite.

What are you guys using
the Trinitario drug money for?

What do you think?

It's our ticket into Wonderland.

Permits, pay-offs, construction.
All that. Dirty cops.

Like you?
Yeah, like me.

Who's running this thing?
How does it work?

Trinitarios are working for Bentwood.

<i>Bentwood works for Macklin.
And they all work for Driscoll.</i>

They already know this.

I need something concrete, Boylan.

Come on, man. I'm on your side.

Let me help you get
the best deal out of this.

<i>Tell me about the Pony Express.</i>


<i>Trinitario street gang and Tracksuit
Charlie do the Pony Express once a week.</i>

<i>You tell your fuckin' Feds
to picture the biggest shipment</i>

of fentanyl and oxy that they can imagine.

All right? And when they get that picture,
tell 'em to triple it.

Where and when?

I will tell you that once I get my deal.

<i>Trinitarios are working for Bentwood.</i>

I swear to God, I didn't give anything!

You're a rat, Boylan.


Bad things happen
to tattletales, don't they?


I didn't give them anything, I swear!

This is my favorite part, you fuckin' rat.

I see you got kara... Excuse me,
karate, after school today, right?

Yes, sir.

You gonna be able to get
yourself home from there?

Yes.

[Driscoll] I need you home by 5:00.
Yes, sir.

[Driscoll] No later.
Yes.

5:00 p.m. What time you comin' home?
5:00.

Please don't be late.
Your mother's killing me about this, so...

Stay right here.

Spenser.
[Spenser] Hey.


Nah. Just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

Okay. Okay.

[inhales deeply] The fuck
you doin' here, Spenser?

I know about Wonderland, brother.

I know you're in deep.

You got any proof, Spenser?

Yeah. Too much.

You know, the good cop
that I know, if he's still in...

All right.
[grunts quietly]

[inhales deeply] Tell you what,
I'm gonna give you

one last chance
to come clean about Wonderland.

Cut a deal with the Feds, tell them
the truth before more people get hurt.

You do your time like a man, brother.

Like I did.

Be a hero for Josh.


That's what I figured.

[Driscoll breathes heavily]

You always were a hard-head. Just like me.

[car door opens]
Bye, roommate.

[car door closes]
[engine starts]

[Boylan over speakers] <i>Trinitarios
are working for Bentwood.</i>

<i>Bentwood works for Macklin.
And they all work for Driscoll.</i>

What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get this done?

Agent Burton, just use the tape
to clear Terrence Graham's name.

This tape? It's not enough.

What are you talking about?
Even without the tape.

The drugs are enough physical evidence

for a RICO case against
the whole Wonderland crew!

[Terrence over speakers]
<i>...Trinitario drug money for?</i>


I'm sorry. I understand how you feel
but I can't tell you any more.

Oh, my God. Now that's bullshit.


Walk away. We've got bigger fish to fry.

We're the FBI. You push us,

we will make so much crap
fly around for you and for Letitia,

that you'll go back to Walpole.
And CPS will...

the best deal out of this.</i>

<i>Tell me about the Pony Express.</i>


<i>It's Tracksuit Charlie, movin' drugs
with the Trinitarios every week.</i>

<i>That's what the Pony Express is.</i>

Hello, ladies.

Lookin' more beautiful
than you did when you got here.


Who?

No, no, no! Okay, Spense.



Who's runnin' the drugs?
Gonna tell me what I wanna know?

[muffled grunting]

Who's drivin'?

What they're drivin'?
Where they're comin' from? When and where?

You're going to tell me everything!

[muffled grunting]

Hey, man! They will cut your head off...

[Spenser] Oh, really?
[gurgling]

What are they driving, Charlie?


Refrigeration van.
Coming from New Hampshire.

Okay. It's coming down the pipes.

It's hid in the refrigeration tanks.

[Spenser] <i>When?
Tomorrow.</i>

[Spenser] <i>When?</i>
[Bentwood]<i> Today! Noon.</i>

[Spenser] <i>Which one?</i>
[Bentwood gasping]

<i>- What day do you meet, Charlie?</i>
[Bentwood] <i>Today!</i>

[tires screech]

[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

[continues speaking Spanish]

[horns blaring]

[tires screeching]

Excuse me, sir. Are you okay?

Oh, my God. You've got blood
all over you. Let me see?



[metal clanging]

Oh, shit.

[breathes shakily]

[speaking Spanish]

You forgot one in the back.
I forgot one in the back?

It's the driver's responsibility
to check the back.


Hey. Hey! Hey!




You... You dead.

Yous is dead.

Oh, shit.

Every single one of them is full. Huh?

This is how the cops are buying
their way into Wonderland.

Jesus Christ! I haven't
done drugs in 20 years.

I don't even know
what I'm lookin' at here.


It's half the drugs in New England.

Isn't this just gonna piss 'em off?

Yeah, it's gonna piss 'em off once
they end up in federal prison, absolutely.

Uh, I don't know if it's enough.

You don't know if it's enough?

What is wrong with you?

a truck full of drugs!

If I gave you a photograph
of them smiling and holding it,

you'd say it wasn't authenticated.
No, that'd be good.

Yeah.
Them holding it? Huh?

If I gave you a video tape,
you'd say it was doctored.

If I walked them into court
with the drugs in their hands,

you'll say they were coerced.

You're unbelievable.

[dog barking]

[barking continues]
Calm down.

Sit!

Shit!
This is not good.

That dude ID'd us.


[Spenser] Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ, man...

Ringo, what's wrong? What's wrong, baby?

What is it, baby? What's up, baby?

What is it, Ringo?
[barking]

Whose van is that?

That's... It's Hawk's. He got a job.

Yeah.
I'm just helping him.

It's just like a side hustle thing.
[Cissy] Uh-huh.

You know what Ringo here's job was
before he retired?

Do you know what his main hustle was?
[Hawk] What?

He was a narcotics dog.

[continues barking]
Bingo! Ringo.

Don't let that thing in here!
Oi! Oi!

[Ringo whimpers]

I need you guys...

What the fuck is that?

You brought drugs into my garage?

Just do me a favor.
Go back in the house with Henry.

What did you do?

Henry?


to stay in the house.

Spenser!
Where's Henry?

He's not here.
Why is he not here?

He... he wanted to go home.

He said he wanted to go.
I specifically told you to stay here!

Why would you let him leave?

What am I supposed to do?
Chain him to the radiator?

Where is he gonna go?
[Cissy] He wanted to go home!

Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding...


Shit, he's FaceTiming me.

Henry doesn't know how to FaceTime.

<i>Spenser.</i>

What do you want?

I want us to sit down and talk
and throw everything on the table.

<i>Work this out before...</i>

I have to kill Henry here.

Hey. Don't touch him.

You hear me? Do not touch him.

These guys are a bunch of idiots, Spenser.

Spenser...
[Spenser]<i> Put Driscoll back on.</i>

Fuck 'em. Hang up.
He hit me in the eye.

Where are ya? I'll come there right now.

Wonderland. One hour.

I'm on my way.

And bring my drug shipment.

[sighing heavily]

What are we gonna do?

[breathing heavily]

You're with me?

Okay.

Look.
[Hawk] Mmm.

Wonderland is basically
like an abandoned fortress.

And there's pretty much
only one way in, right here.

It's the middle of the day.
There's not a lot of places to hide.

We're gonna have to get
Henry out of the way.

And I got a plan.

It's a little unconventional.
You're gonna have to trust me.

No, no, no.
No, you don't get the cool gun.

Aw. Hawk is the name of
a motherfucker with a shotgun.

Spenser does your taxes.

That was good. I'll give you that one.

All right.

I'd really love to understand

the process of why you took me
as a hostage.

Nobody's gonna come for me.

I got about three minutes left in me.

Nobody gives a shit if I live or die.

I don't even care much if I live or die.

You hit me in the eye.
What you hit me in the eye for?

I was sitting, minding my own business.

You come in, I say, "Hello,"
and you hit me in the eye.

I gotta go to the bathroom.
Henry.

What?
[Driscoll] Henry.

I will gag you, old-timer.

Gag me or not, I still gotta go
to the bathroom.

Who's running point on this shit-show?

Get that fuckin' sword out of my face.

Do you work at a Brazilian steakhouse?

Are you kidding me?


This is how you treat

an old man, a poor
mentally-challenged old man?

Let's go, Henry.
I'm not mentally challenged.

Shut up, Henry! You're in shock.
Come sit down.

You got a...
What're you doin' here?

...prostate the size of a grapefruit.

Come here. Just sit down.
[Henry] Where's Spenser?

Shame on you! Did they violate you?

Sexually?
No.

What are you talking about?

Did you engage in ass-play?
No!

[Cissy] You can tell me...
Bitch, please.

Stop playin'.

Where's Spenser?

I can't tell you that.

I will blow your fuckin' head off.

[bird screeches]

[engine roaring]

What the fuck?

[birds squawking]

Holy shit!

Whoo-hoo!



[tires squeal]
[grunting]

[engine sputtering]

[country music playing on radio]



[Spenser] Oh, my God.
[gunshots continue]

This is your plan?

My plan only went as far
as the entrance, okay?

Shit!
[Henry] Spenser!

[gunshots continue]


Okay, go get him. I got you.
[Spenser] All right.






Driscoll!

Shit.

[door bangs open]

Yo!

[both grunt]

That's how you throw a fuckin' punch!

[yells in Spanish]
[yells]

[indistinct yelling]


[breath trembling]

[machete clatters]

[breathing heavily]


[Driscoll groans]

It's over.

What, are you gonna shoot me?

How did you kill Officer Terrence Graham?

Huh?

What'd you do?

Wrap his hand around the gun,
make it look like a suicide?

You have your boys hold him still for you?

I mean, cops killing cops?

When did that ever become okay?


So, what are you gonna do?

You know what I'm gonna do.

You're goin' to prison.

First, I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

Yeah? What's that?

Oh, a cop in prison's
gotta know how to fight.

You take my word for that.

[gun clatters]
Let's go.

Oh, let's.

[sighs] I'm sick of your shit.
Come on.

You think you're special?
Let's go.

Oh, you're not a fuckin' choirboy.

You're a fuckin' jailbird! Fuck you!

[both grunting]

[Spenser groans] Fuckin'...

I gave you a chance, brother.

[Spenser grunting]

[Driscoll] Fuck your chance.
Fuck!




You ain't got what it takes
to make it in prison, you know why?

'Cause you're weak.

[both grunting]

[breathing heavily] Come on.

Your stupid Serpico morality,
it doesn't work in the real world.

[Spenser grunts] Mother...


[pained grunting]


[grunting]
You were always so fuckin' naive!

Huh? You thought
you could help the victims?


You ain't helping shit.

Always some endless
fuckin' need for sympathy.

Oh, please, that's shit!


You hear me?
You ain't helping no one.

[Spenser softly] Fuck.

There's no justice, Spenser!

There's only the strong and the weak.



They gonna find your body
wherever I dump it.

They gonna put chalk around you, boy.
You gonna die.

Henry, too.


And I'm gonna walk
these motherfuckin' streets!

[inhales sharply]

Forever.

[bones snap]
[Driscoll screams]

[both grunting]


[Spenser grunting]
[groaning]


You know what, bad guy?

I'm gonna serve some justice today.

I'm gonna make a citizen's arrest.

You're under arrest.

[grunts]
[handcuffs click]

You save the bad guy talk for the boys
in whatever federal prison you go to.

You can tell 'em I said hello.


[sirens wailing]

[helicopter whirring]

Damn.

You boys is fucked.
