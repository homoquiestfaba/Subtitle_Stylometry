[Charles Trenet

[dog moans]

[female voice]
My name is Amy.

And yes, at college,
I blew my dog.

I don't know why,

maybe it was just
out of boredom

or just some kind
of dumb experiment.

Like knowing
something is hot
but you touch it,

and you're surprised
when you get burned.

Ugh.

I'm not into bestiality
in any way.

No, no, no.

It was just something
completely stupid.

I was full of guilt but,

at the same time,
as disgusting as it was,

another part of me
kind of thought
it was funny.

I could never tell anyone.
Anyone!

Not friends, although it'd be
a hell of an icebreaker
at a cocktail party.

Anyone here besides me
know what canine semen
tastes like?

I couldn't tell
any boyfriend.

Men are insecure
about their penises.

There's no need to bring
the whole animal kingdom
into it.

As the years went by,
when it popped
into my mind,

it was like something
that happened
to someone else.

Like a movie I had watched,
not starred in.

I never had to tell
any boyfriends because
I was never that serious

that I felt the need
to be totally honest.

Until now.

Until John.

And that is why
my life was turning to shit.

(male voice)
Penny for your thoughts.

Where did you go?

Sorry.

What were you
thinking?

Nothing.

You were thinking
about something.

A--friend.

A friend?

A boyfriend
you haven't told me about?

No, just a--

companion.

Ahh.

Do you love me?

More than anything.

How much?

I love you more
than anything
in the whole wide world.

Good.

Why?
What's this about?

Nothing.

All right.

You all finished, Steve?

Ah, right.

So, would you please?

Oh, my God.
You are such a baby.
He's not even my dog.

Ugh.
I'm gonna need
another bag.

You sure your dog did this
and not some hobo?

Yeah, a hobo's
would smell better.

You're gonna pay for this.
I am not carrying it.

Whatever happened
to your dog?

I gave him away.

Why?

He got too big.

Oh.

Hey.

Hey.

So...my first byline.

I'm so proud.
Where is it?

Now it's a short piece, so...

It's a start.

It's a great start.

Yes.

Yes. Yes!

Yeah?

Mm-hmm.

Wait, wait, wait!

You gotta read
the fine print first.

[soft music]

Here.

It fits.

You know
you have a nice penis?

Thank you.

And you're my best friend.

You're my best friend.

I feel like
I could tell you anything.

Me, too.

When I was a boy,

and I played with myself,
the first time I came,

I thought I broke
my bits.

How old were you?

Twenty.

Nine.

Twenty nine.

No! Nine!

Tell me a secret.

Tell me the weirdest thing
you've ever done.

Something that you
wouldn't tell anybody.

I don't like
this game.

What?

Oh, come on,
we're gonna get married soon,
we shouldn't have secrets.

Oh, now this is really
gonna drive me nuts.

I love everything that made
you you, you don't have
to be ashamed.

Are you sure?

Yes.

Okay.

Well

One time

when I was
in college

I...

You what?

Yeah?

I slept with
my girlfriend Linda.

Slept-slept?
'Cause I slept with my brother,
Brad, till I was five.

No!

Sex.

Really?
How did that happen?

We were just out
late one night, drinking.

And one thing
led to another.

Ooh.

I had never had sex with
Linda, or any woman.

The idea of sex
without a penis
is like--

a sandwich without meat.
Felt a little bad
lying to him but--

on the upside,
John liked it,

and I got fucked good
because of it.

Hey!

How's the gorgeous dame
business been treating you?

Oh, not too bad.

Mind if I join you?

Have a seat.

Yeah, what do you like
most about teaching?

Hmm, I would have to say
the microwave food.

Ah-hah.

You?

I would have to say

pretending that you like
all the kids the same

when some of them
are real assholes.

And the microwave food.

Oh, yeah.

How's John?

Great.

Good.

What's wrong?
Is he cheating?

No!

If he was,
I'd have to give him
the, you know--

sleepin' pill.

How important do you think
it is to be totally honest
in a relationship?

If you want
the relationship to last,
nothing but the truth.

Even if it's gonna hurt
the other person?

I don't know,
I think honesty
is overrated.

Look, I love Beth,
but the first time
we got together,

she wanted me
to suck her toes.

I wouldn't
so she got hurt.

Why not?
Men put their faces
in worse places.

Oh, but her feet
stink really bad.

She's super clean,
but her feet stink worse
than any dude's.

The first time
she took off her shoes,
I almost passed out.

It smelled like
she had been making
shit wine.

You didn't tell her that?

Hell, yeah.

How did she take it?

Badly, but now, she knows
that I don't suck her toes

not because
I don't love her,

but because
her feet stink.

Do you suck
her toes now?

Uhh--no.

If you want
the relationship to last,

you gotta be
brutally honest.

[school bell ringing]

Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

Have a great time.
Call me when
you get back.

I will.
Hey!

Linda's lending me
her bag for our trip.

Cool.
You leaving?

Yeah.

Bye.

Okay.

See ya.
Say hi to your mom
for me.

Okay, let's hit
the road.

Go away,
you're gross.

What's wrong?

Do we have to take
Steve?

Nobody could
watch him.

What's bothering you?

Nothing's
bothering me. Steve!

Calm down, Steve.
Find your own bitch.

I need to smoke.

So smoke.

I can't smoke.
My parents don't know
I smoke.

I'm not driving
five hours in a car
without you smoking.

Blame me,
tell them
I smoke.

They're not gonna be
too thrilled
that you smoke either.

[soft music]

Baby, how
can you not know

where your
parents' house is?

I never spent time
driving to it,
only away from it.

Getting cold feet?
'Cause it feels like
you're mad at me.

No! I--
I love you.

Well, what's
the problem then?

Nothing, I just--
get nervous
around my parents, you know?

My mom is really sweet,
my dad is really smart,
they just--

think I'm perfect.

I'm the one who's
supposed to be nervous.

My dad wanted
to be a writer, too.

You told him
I wrote?

I told him
you worked for a paper.

Honey, I deliver
a newspaper.

It's not even a newspaper,
it's a weekly.
A free weekly.

That's great.
He's gonna think
I'm a bum.

No, they're gonna love you.
They have to love you.
They're my parents.

Besides, they reserve
their strongest criticisms
for me.

I'm so fucking nervous.

Oh, that's
another thing.

My mom is really religious
so we don't swear
in front of her.

By we,
I mean you.

We don't swear or smoke,
are you sure
these are your parents?

Yes.

Shoulda hired
a Sherpa.

[Amy chuckles]

One second.
All right.

You ready?

No.

Kiss me.

[doorbell rings]

Oh!
Diamond girl!

Hi, Mom!

Hi, Daddy.

You must be John.

Hello, sir.

I give hugs, John.

Oh!

[mother sniffs]

Oh, that's me,
I smoke.

No.
I smell feces.

Oh, fuck!

Sorry, I didn't
mean to say it.
I'll get you a new pot.

The dog was in the car
way too long.

Let's go inside.

Yeah!

We were about
to give up on you.

You get lost?

I told you to get
the directions from the Web.

I thought
I'd remember.

That's our Dizzy.

Honey, don't bite
your lip.

And who is this
offending beast?

John's dog.

We didn't want
to leave him at home.

His name is Steve.

Steve.
Hi, Steve.

Where do you guys
keep your paper towels?

I'm gonna clean up
that mess outside.

I'll give you a hand.

Whoo.
Let me look at you.

Ooh.
You look so pretty!
Are you eating?

Yes, Mom.

I'm really sorry about this.
You must think
I'm an idiot.

I'm not upset
about the plant
or the dog mess.

But John, while
you're staying here,

I'm gonna have to ask you
to watch the potty mouth.

I'm no shrinking violet,
I like to curse myself.

But at the stag night,
and the whatnot.

Not around Amy's mother,
swearing upsets her.

Of course. Sir.

Amy's mother
is very old-fashioned.

I'm the only man
she's ever slept with.

I'm not naive, John,
I know that you and Amy
are probably having sex.

But I am gonna have to ask you
while you're a guest here,

to sleep
in separate rooms.

Out of respect
for her mother.

Yeah, of course,
I wouldn't have it
any other way, sir.

And thanks
for having us.

Oh, not at all.
I'm glad to have you.

Oh, you missed
some shit there.

[voices from TV]

Douglas, say hello
to your sister

and her boyfriend, John.

Hey, bro.

Hi.

John.

How you doing?

Dougie has been
living with us.

When were you
here last?

Christmas.

He's been here
for eight months.

He lost his job.

I didn't lose it.
Spicks and the niggers
with the quotas took it.

Dougie! Don't upset
your mother!

Come sit down.
I made dinner.

He's not really a racist.
He just lost
his girlfriend, too.

Of course.

Diamond girl
tells us you're a writer.

Yeah, I work
for a paper.

Which one?

The Free Press.

Is that one
of those weeklies

full of feminist propaganda
that makes its revenue
with titty bar ads?

Yes.

Douglas, are you trying
to give your mother
a nervous breakdown?

Yes!

Oh!

What?

John's a vegetarian.
He doesn't eat meat.

Oh.

Oh.

Do you want me
to make you some chicken?

He doesn't eat meat.

This looks great.
I'll have some of this.

So, uh, why do you
call her "diamond girl"?

'Cause she was
our flawless little girl.

Still is.

I think
she's flawless, too.

Let me show you
her scholastic ribbons.

She was spelling bee champ
three years in a row.

You never told me that.

And Valedictorian
of her graduating class.

Oh! Don't forget to mention
all the cookies she sold
as a Girl Scout.

I'm going to bed.

Good night.

Good night, Doug.

Get down her soccer trophies
and the prom queen photos.

No, Dad, don't.

This is good,
I wanna see them.

Oh, my God,
look how big my hair is!
I look like Sheila E!

You were
the prettiest
girl there.

I had no idea
you won so many awards.

She's modest.

Well, this
has been fun,

but maybe we
should all turn in.

Yeah, that's a good idea.

Mom, I'll help you clear.

I won't say no
to extra hands.

Me neither.

We don't have sex
under this roof.

We can try.

Don't drop them,
Dizzy.

I won't, Daddy.

Good night.

Good night.

What are
you wearing?

I know.
I feel like
I should be wearing a nightcap

carrying a candle
making this face.

I told you about that stuff.
Why'd you pretend
not to know?

It was fun
watching your parents
be so proud of you.

It's embarrassing.

Where are you sleeping?

Your brother's room.

Mm.

I have blue balls.

Is it my sexy nightgown?

Tents make me horny.

Nighty night.

Nighty night.

Nighty night.

Nighty night.

Nighty night.

[soft music]


Meth?

Do you want some?

I'm good.

You don't party?

Yeah, I party,
just not meth.

Hm.

Don't say anything
to my family.

Okay?


You know, I was
the perfect one
before she came around.

And then,

after that I just
couldn't do anything right.

I'm sure your parents
love you both very much.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Mm-hmm.


Say something.

What?

Say something.

Something.

(recorded voice)
Something.

Something.

Something.

Something.

Something.
Something.
Something.

Something. Something.
Something. Something.

Tump. Tump. Tump...

I got this
at a garage sale.

It's so sweet.

F ive bucks.
They didn't know
what they had.

[distorted voice]
Something.

I just have to learn
how to use it.

And teach myself
how to play.

And then, l's thinkin',

I could, like--
lay down some tracks--

Something.
Something.

You know, I could be
like a, like a--

um, recording star.

Something.
Something.

[keyboard notes]

[mimics keyboard notes]
Hello, hello.

There is no limit
to what this does.

[strange noises
come from keyboard]

Ow.

Ow.

Ow.
Ow.

Ow.

[popping noise]



[birds chirping]

[dog barking]

[music from screen]

Wake up.

Mom and l
made breakfast.

Wake up, honey.
Your sister and l
made breakfast.

Go away.

Cheese and crackers,
he's a grouch
in the morning.

Well, don't take
too long.

How'd you sleep?

Oh, just great.
Do you know
he smokes meth?

You're serious?

Yes! In this room.
He offered me some.

Right before
he sang into his piano
all night.

What?

Don't ask.

He's got
some chops, though.

That was delicious,
ladies.

What's Daddy doing?

Oh, the neighbor's tree
fell into our yard.

Why don't you
go talk to him?

Not now,
he's got an ax.

I tell my neighbor
he needs to trim his trees
and he ignores me.

That's all right.
I got it.

Now, I have to build
a whole new fence.

Well, I guess good fences
don't build good neighbors.

Frost wasn't talking
about my douche-bag neighbor
when he wrote that.

He's going to ask Dad
if you can marry him.

How did you know?

He has that fear
in his eyes

that your father had
when he asked Grandpa.

Actually, I have
a confession to make.

I'm not really a writer.

Oh?

I just deliver
the Free Times.

I'm--I'm trying to write.
I submit my stuff
all the time.

The Chinese
have a saying.

Find a job
that you love

and you'll never have to work
a day in your life.

You must love teaching.

I hate it.

I always have hated it.

Every second of it.

That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

You're young.

Don't give up
on this writing.

You don't have
any responsibilities.

You'll have plenty of time
to settle down later.

I haven't been
honest with him.

About what?

I can't tell you.

Is it a sex thing?

Honey, that's
not a big deal.

We all have
those kind of secrets.

Mother!

Well,

there were things I did
before I met your father

that he
doesn't know about.

Jesus.

My son is on drugs.

Pardon me?

I'd kick him out, but
his mother won't let me.

She sticks up for him.

I don't know
what happened to that kid.

I wish--

I wish he were more
like his sister.

She's never let me down.

Daddy always said
he was the first person
you ever slept with.

Technically,
I wasn't lying.

My daughter is
one of the few things

that brings me joy
in my life.

I think
the world of her.

I do, too, sir.

When I was a young girl,
living in Memphis,

one night, my girlfriends
and I were at an arcade
when it was closing,

and this man came up
to us and...

told us that...

Elvis would like us
to stay.

You had sex
with Elvis?

Will you let me
tell my story?

Yes.

That's why
I want to marry her.

We were invited
back to Graceland,

and Elvis asked
my friend and l

to join him
in the bedroom.

And you had sex
with him?

Well, yes and no.

What about the writing?
Haven't you heard
anything I've said to you?

He just played
with himself
and watched.

You wrestled another woman
in your underwear
while Elvis beat off?

And you didn't
even get laid?

Look, if I was to die
and never be published,
I could live with that.

But I couldn't live
without marrying
your daughter.

I had sex
with Roy Orbison, too.

Roy Orbison!

Oh, no!

He was cute
when he was young.

Oh, no, Mom,
Roy Orbison
was never cute.

You're right.
He was never cute.

You never told Daddy.

Mm-mm.

Sometimes I wish I had.

It bothers me
a lot, but...

I was never able
to work up the courage.

You know, John,

there are some men,

crueler men, perhaps,

who would just let you hang
in the wind for a while.

But I give you
my blessing.

Thank you, sir.

What should I do?

Tell him.

Tell him
whatever this thing is.

If he can't accept it,
he's the wrong guy.

Don't carry it around
half your life like I have.

I still feel dirty
and guilty.

Especially when
I hear Pretty Woman.

Or when wrestling
is on.

Look at them.

They have no idea--
don't smile!

They have no idea
what we're talking about.

It's killing them, huh?

Yeah.

Just look sad.

Look sad.

They don't look happy.

Just smile.
Just keep smiling.

Okay.

I hope everybody's
hungry.

I am.

[doorbell rings]

Folks. Sister.

Hey, Randy.

Guy.

Hello, Randy.

Hi.

This is John.

See ya.

Why don't you boys
stay and eat?

It does look
pretty tempting.

Yeah, sit down,
join us.

Dougie!

Eat.

So what are you boys
up to tonight?

Uh, gotta see
a guy--

about a--thing.

Job--jobby--thing.

What?

Yeah, this dude--
It's gonna be good.
Right, buddy?

Oh, I see.

Let's eat.

That was delicious.

Come on,
let's go.

Oh, why
don't you boys stay?

Yes, stay.
We could, uh, do a puzzle.

A puzzle?
That'd be great.

Oh.

Are you against fun?

First, we need to find
all the edge pieces.

I wish these monkeys
weren't all the same color.

You know what monkeys hate?
Midgets.

Really?

They see them
as a threat
and try to kill them.

And midgets know it, too,
and are scared of monkeys.

Ha!

A friend
worked on a set

they had a midget
and a monkey

and the midget said,
"Hell no, I'm not
working with that thing."

The monkey went--
not ape shit but--

You know
what I mean.

See you, man.

Thanks for
coming over, Randy.

Where's my rock?

I was trying to tell you
before dinner.
Nobody has any.

Sorry, man.

Hey, is your sister
serious about that dude?

Seemed kinda
like a cock.

Just one man's opinion.




[soft knocking]

What took you
so long?

Where are we going?

Just come on.

[Amy giggles]

Wow!

This car's been here
since I was a kid.

Get in.

In the back.

Okay.

What did my dad say?

That he loves you.

Yeah.

And that
he hates teaching.

And I forget
what else he said.

Tell me another story.

What kind of story?

Like you
and your friend Linda.

Oh, that kind of story.

Yeah, that kind of story.

You tell me
a story.

Okay.

Here's something
I lived with
over the years.

When I was at camp,

me and about
five other guys,

we played
"shoot the cookie."

What's that?

Shoot the cookie.

It's where we all
stand around--

and beat off on a cookie,
and the last one to finish
has to eat it.

Did you lose?

Oh, my God!

Oh, I can't believe
I told you that.

No, it's okay.

Why did I tell you that
after you still haven't
told me

your big dark secret?

Okay.

What? Come on,
it can't be that gross.

Well...

What?

Well, a long time ago,
when I was at school,

and I was alone...

Yeah.

but I wasn't alone.

Who were you with?

Rufus.

Rufus?

Rufus, my dog.

And he was lying
on his back,

and I was staring
at his penis,

and--

I sucked him off!

No.

You didn't just
tell me that. No.

[laughing nervously]
I was kidding,
it never happened.

I was trying
to make you laugh!

Oh, my God,
well, you didn't.

I don't know
why I did it.
I never did it again.

I can't breathe.

I feel like
I'm going to throw up.

You won't let me
touch you?

You fuck dogs?

No! It happened just once,
and I never did it again!

I didn't fuck him,
I just sucked him off.
It was just a dumb thing.

Oh.

Hold me.

Please hold me.

You forced me to tell you,
and now you hate me.

No.

Hold me back, then.

Kiss me.

You can't even kiss me.

Yeah.

I wish
I were dead.




[inhales deeply]


Baby?

Baby, what's wrong?

John.

Did you have
a fight?

Oh.
Oh, there, there.

I'm sure
it's not a big deal.

It is a big deal,
Mom. I told him,
and now he hates me.

He doesn't hate you.

So you're not
a virgin. Big deal.
I doubt he is either.

Do you want me
to go talk to him?

No!
No, please, don't do that.
You'll just make it worse.

It might help.

No, really, please,
promise me you won't!

All right.

John?

May I speak with you
for a moment?

Privately.

I heard
about your argument.

Are you high?

Upsetting my daughter
like that?!

I want you to say
you're sorry to her.

Do you know how hard
it was for her
to tell you that?


Good morning, John.

Good morning.

Hi.

Hi.


Well, good morning.

You're up early.

Eggs?

Yeah, yeah,
thanks, Mom.

Good morning.

That was fun last night,
wasn't it?

What?

The puzzle.

Oh, yeah.

Mom, I like them
sunny side up.

Just eat them.

That's not
how I like 'em.

Why do you have
to be such a jerk?

Um, I know
something about Amy.

Something dirty she did.

Dougie, that's enough.

She's not the angel
you guys make her
out to be.

Be quiet.

[clears throat]
Amy blew a dog.

What did you say?

That Amy sucked
a dog's cock.

Ah!


You pathetic piece
of shit!

It's your fault
for being
soft on him.

No! No!

Stop them.

You think I'm fucking?
Amy's a fucked up whore.

Daddy, stop it,
he's not lying!

It's true!

I did it, l--

I did
what he said I did.

John and l
are leaving.

I love you, Daddy.

Yeah.

This is the first time,

since the day
you were born,

that I'm ashamed
to be your mother.

[Louis Armstrong sings
When You're Smilin']

* When you're smiling *

* When you're smiling *
* When you're smiling *

* The whole world
Smiles with you *

* And when you're laughing *

* Oh, you're laughing *
* Oh, you're laughing *

* Mm, and the sun comes
Shining through *

* When you're crying,
You bring on the rain *

* Stop your sighing *

* Won't you be happy again *

* When you're smiling *

* Keep on smiling *
* Keep on smiling *

* And the whole world
Smiles with you *

I really wish
you hadn't told me.
A dog!

You ate a cookie
covered with sperm!

Yeah!
Human sperm!

Oh, what?
Now you care
who knows?

You forced me
to tell you!

Not about blowing a dog!
What's wrong with you?

Did you get high
with my brother?

No!

How dare you.

[When You're Smilin'
continues]

Hey, buddy,
what's wrong?

You wanna talk?

Okay, then I'll talk.

Do you know that I know
the ancient art
of Origami?

That was a student's
test paper.

That's okay,
I know this kid,
he wasn't gonna pass.

All right, now this is
the most important part.

Close your eyes.
Keep 'em closed.

Voila.

A flower.

Or, or a duck.

Everyone I love
hates me.

Nobody could hate you.

John and my family do.

They think
I'm disgusting.

I did a terrible thing.

Well, this terrible thing,

did you mean to hurt
anyone on purpose?

No.

Well, it sounds to me
like you just made
a mistake.

This was
pretty disgusting.

Look, you're being
too hard on yourself.

You're the sweetest
person I know, even
if you are just human.

In fact, that's the part
I like the best.

You're gross, yeah,
I was fucking Steve.

I didn't say anything.

I can't do this anymore.

You wanna break up?

No. Do you?

No.

I just wish
you never told me.

I wish
I never told you, too!

I wish it never
happened! It was just
some dumb stupid thing

I did when I was
18, and now nobody
wants to be with me!

I'm sorry.


Can I sleep
in the bed
tonight?

Sleep?

I missed us.

I missed us, too.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

You're not hard.

I will be,
just shut up
and kiss me.

You can't get hard.

I will
if you stop talking.


Mm-hm.

Mm-hm.

I'm gonna get more.

Mm-hm.

Oh, no!
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

Ooh-ooh.

Cheers.

Cheers.

I have a confession
to make.

You're a dude?

No.

I don't like women.

I agree, I think
most of them
are pains in the asses.

No.

I don't "like" women.

I think vaginas
are disgusting.

My friend Linda?

Yeah?

No.

You lost me.

I never had sex
with her.

Really?

Are you bummed?

No, I'm not bummed.

But why would you
tell me that you did?

I thought
you wanted to hear it.

Are you mad at me?

No, no.

What can I do
to make it up to you?

Something dirty.

What?

I wanna see you do it.

You know,
with Steve.

You're gross.

Why?

You're not kidding.

Baby, you did it before.
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

I fucking hate you.

Now you have morals?
There's a line
you can't cross?

I made a mistake once,
and you can't forgive me!

I wanted to see it
for myself.

I made a mistake with you.

I made a mistake with you,
you dog blowin' cunt.

Sorry about what
I said last night.

Me, too.

You didn't say
anything wrong.

Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry
about what you said.

Actually,
I take that back.

I'm glad to know
what you think of me.

I can't get it
out of my head.

I can't live like this.

I'm leaving.

Amy, please--

Don't!
Don't do that!

You know what?
Do whatever you want.
I can't take it anymore.


[phone rings]

Hello?

Hi, Daddy.

It's Amy.
How are you?

Fine.

Who is it?

It's Amy.

How was your trip
back home?

We made it
back fine.

I'm really sorry
about how things--

Please, don't.

I don't want to talk
about this.

I just wanted to say--

I don't want
to discuss what
you're gonna say.

Okay. I'm sorry.
I won't bring it up again.

Can I talk
to Mom?

She's not here
right now.
She's out.

Out?

Oh...

Well...

give her my love.

I love you, Daddy.

Yeah, me, too.


Fuck him.

You can do
so much better than him.
You know that.

That last time I saw him,
he got letchy and weird
and hugged me too long.

He did?

Yeah.
I wasn't gonna say
anything then but--

he's disgusting,
you can't go
back to him.

Men suck.

Yeah.

Hey, guys? Hi.

We're not including you
as a man, baby.

Nice save.

Look, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

Thanks, you guys.

Need his ass kicked?
'Cause, um, Linda's
super strong.

I love you, faggot.

I fuckin'
love you, too, twat.

[Carl moaning]

Oh, yeah, it's in.
Right there.
Keep moving like that.

Oh, my God.
Squeeze my balls.

Oh, yeah.
Slow down.

Oh, my God.
You like it
in that hole?

Yeah, that's a good hole.

Oh, my gosh.
I got a mommy now.

Oh, now I got a mommy.

M m, mm, mm.

And he's, like, " Uh, uh."

It's so weird,
it's like listening
to ghosts fucking.

I'm sleeping
on an inflatable mattress,
it's like a life raft.

I gotta get
my own place.

I'll help you look,
let me go with you.

Beth wouldn't mind?

She's been working late,
I haven't seen her
in weeks.

You're a pal.

Where are we?

That's it!
Perfect.

Okay, I'll stop.

No.

Want me to stop?

You could live
out your days
as a crack whore.

That'd be nice.

There you go,
there's a cute place.

It doesn't look
like it gets
morning sun.

Morning sun?
Is that like
your lndian name?


I like it.

No, really?

Yeah, really.

[phone rings]

Hello?

Mom?

Hello.

What's wrong?

Your brother
is in jail.

My God. Why?

Robbery.
He didn't do it.

Someone else
used his car.

We thought you were
the lawyer.

I have to get off
the phone.

I understand.

[phone rings]

Hello?

Hey, um--

it's me, Ed.
I'm sorry to be
calling so late.

No, no problem.
What's wrong?

I think Beth's
having an affair.

Why do you
think that?

Well, she's been working
late, and she works
with this guy Charlie.

and umh...

So I thought
I would surprise her
with dinner

so I walked
into her office

and she was on her desk
fucking Charlie.

That might be
an affair.

Look, I'm sorry.
Am I buggin' you
with this?

No! Why don't you
come over?

I couldn't--

Please, it's the
least I could do.

Just come on over,
I'll see you
in a little while.

All I've got is wine
and a loaf of bread.

Have you been
entertaining Christ?

That's it.
I'm done with women.
They're evil.

I'd be gay
if it wasn't
for the sex thing.

I don't get it,
why can't people
be committed?

I've been attracted
to other women, but
I've never acted on it.

Ed, commitment
is a reaction,
not a decision.

Are you sure
you're only 26?

What's the youngest women
you've ever had sex with?

Oh.

Sixteen.

Wow.

Ah, it's not that
impressive. I was
only 16, too.

I'm such a loser.

No, you're not.

I think you're great.


Ed.

Yeah,
I'm too old for you.

No, you're
on my hair!

Oh! Sorry.

Um,

um,

um, don't.

Why not?

I'm fat.

Says who?

Beth.

Beth's a jerk.

I think you're hot.

School.

Oh, my God!
We cannot act
like weirdos at work.

No, we gotta be
totally cool about this.


Ow!

Doorknob.
I got it.
It's in my ass.

I'm really happy.

Hey, John,
it's me.

And I'm gonna come by
this weekend and pick up
my stuff, okay?

All right.
Bye.

Not there.

Not picking up.

So, uh, what was
that disgusting thing

that you told me
that everyone was
so upset about?

All right, forget it.
I never brought it up, okay?

Wow.

Thanks for coming with me
to pick up this stuff.

Of course.

It's not like
you could carry
the couch on your own.

Will he be there?

Yeah.

But don't worry.

He's a pussy.

Look, um,

I'm sorry about
last night, okay?

Me, too.

Hi.

Hi.

Come on in.

How's it going?

Good.

Ed.

Sure!

What's he doing here?

He's just a friend.

Fuckin' him
for his Medicaid?

Yeah, good one.

At least
I'm fucking someone.

So, this couch?

Take it.

A little help?

Right.

Thanks, pal.

Ow, fuck.

Sorry.

Okay.

God!

Okay.
All right.

What do you think?
I think I liked it
better over there.

Dude, I think one of
my balls just rolled out
of my pant leg.

It looks great here.

Are you sure?

I'm positive.

Let's see
if it works.

Ow!

That's gotta hurt.


mm, hmm

mm, hmm

I gotta pee.
I gotta pee.
Hold on.

I'll be right back.

[phone rings]

Hello, Dad?

Amy?

What's wrong?

Your mother--

She had
an aneurysm.

Oh, my God.
Is she okay?

No.

She's not.

Oh, my God!

I will.

No, no, no!

You okay in there?

Yes, I'm fine.

Look, uh,
let me drive you.

You don't understand,
my family is weird.

Whose isn't?

Look, you're in no shape
to drive.

[soft music]

Who's this?

This is my friend, Ed.

Hi, Ed.

Sir.

What happened
to John?

We broke up.

Oh, of course.

Well, come on in.

We had just started dinner
when it happened.

I can't put
the food away.

You don't have to, Daddy.

Your brother
still doesn't know,
I'm not speaking to him.

He really shouldn't hear it
from a stranger, though.

I'll tell him.

Look, uh,

I'm gonna get
a hotel room.

You guys should
really be alone.

Look, you tell your dad
I said goodbye.

All right, call me
if you need anything,
okay? Please?

I will.
Thanks.

All right.

[soft music]

Hey.

Hey, morning.

No, you are not coming
with me to prison
to see my brother.

No, that is the last place
you should go alone.

You're borderline stalking.
This is my family.

Look, I don't think
you know how nuts
I am about you.

All right?
None of this
bothers me.

My brother's crazy.

You should meet
my family.

Nuts.

Who's this guy?

This is my friend, Ed.

Nice to meet you.

So, nice outfit, huh?
What do you think?

Dougie, I have
some terrible news.

What?

Mom died.

Um--

From what?

A brain aneurysm.

umh... What causes that?

Sometimes it just happens,
sometimes it just--

Sometimes what?

Stress.

You and Dad
blame me, huh?

You do.

Mom died when she couldn't
bear that her daughter
was a fucked-up whore.

Don't start.

Oh, haven't you told
your boyfriend about
your big secret?

Fuck you!

Fuck you, too!
At least, I didn't kill Mom!


You can tell me
anything. Okay?

I want to know what
happened. I don't
care what it was.

We need to be totally
honest with each other.

No, we don't!
I want you to go home.
You're not my boyfriend.

[doorbell rings]

Hey, Randy.

Hey, Amy.

Sorry
about your mom.

Thank you, Randy.

And uhm...

sorry about
that other thing, too.

Your brother
told me. Yeah.

I guess
he wasn't supposed to.

Or I wasn't supposed
to tell you that I knew,

but anyway, I know,
and sorry about both.

I mean, I'm sorry,
but forget--

It's fine.
Thanks.

I kissed
a dead body once.

Oh.

Yeah, I never told
anybody that.

Hey, my mom made this
casserole and wanted me
to bring it over.

Tell her thank you.

It bounced around
in my truck a little.
Should be okay.

It smells like gas, but--

it probably
doesn't taste like it.

You don't have to eat it
if you don't want to.

You look really pretty
when you're sad.

You, too.

[soft music]

[indistinct chattering]

I need you
to love me, Daddy.

(Ed, recorded)
Hi, this is Ed's cell,
please leave a message.

[no audio]

Ed?

Hey.

We need to talk.
How come you won't
return my phone calls?

I'm not an idiot.
I was leaving you alone.

Come here.

Listen, I'm really sorry
about how I acted
the other day.

That's okay.
Not like you were
under pressure.

Look, I'm sorry, too.
I was movin' way too fast.

How about dinner?

I'm sorry,
I thought you heard.

Beth and l
are together again.

Oh.

That's great.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Are you happy?

Yeah, yeah,
we're in therapy,

it's working,
and we're getting
a lot off our chests.

I'm really happy
for you.

Thank you.

[sad piano music]

Anybody home?

I know you smoke.

You've been smoking
since you were 13.

Why didn't you
say something?

I didn't want you
to know I knew.

Oh.

You want anything?

Water.

You ever hear
from that Ed?

No.

He seemed
like a nice guy.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Have a seat.

Your mother
wrote you a letter.

She wrote it
before your brother
went to jail.

I never got around
to sending it.

Dear Amy,

I can't begin to tell you
how sorry I am

for the way
I have treated you.

I'm not going to say
I forgive you.

because you did
nothing wrong.

We all do
dumb things
in our youth.

As you know.
And I hope
you can forgive me.

I have never stopped
being proud of you.

You will always be
my diamond girl.

I love you.

Mom.

I want you
to have this.

Daddy, I can't.

You're my diamond
girl, too.

I know your mother
had a secret.

Did your mother tell you
that she had sex with
someone else other than me?

You're crazy, Dad.

I'm sorry.

Mom was
the original virgin.

I know, I know--
sometimes my mind--

You're right,
I am crazy.

Here.

Oh.


I don't know
why she kept all that.

I don't know
why that's there.

Ticket stub from
a Roy Orbison concert.

I don't know either.

God, I loved
Roy Orbison.

Mom did, too.

What are you
doing here?

We need to talk.

I don't know
if that's a good idea.

Please.

All right.

Hey, Beth, I'm taking
Cowboy for a walk.

Come on, Cowboy,
come on.

So what's the emergency?

Look, I know
you're trying to work
things out with Beth,

and I want to be
respectful of that, but--

I love you, Ed.

Things aren't working
out so well with Beth.

I want to be with you.

I'm afraid of you.

Why can't you just
tell me what happened?

I can't!

I better head back.

If I tell you what I did,

you'll think I'm disgusting,
and you won't love me anymore.

I'm disgusting.

No, you're not.
You're perfect.

I love porn, okay?
I've got tons of porn.

I beat off to it
for hours at a time.

It's much worse
than that.

I know what happened.

You do?

You had an abortion.

Yes.

That's why you were
gonna marry John,
because of the baby.

Things weren't working out
so you had an abortion.

Your parents found out,
and they got mad at you.

Do you still love me?

For being honest?

I love you
even more.

Do you really watch
that much porn?

Why?

I think porn
is kinda gross.

Really?

Mm-hmm.

No, I was just
telling you that
to make you feel better.

Oh.

[Roy Orbison sings
You Got It]

* Every time I look
Into your loving eyes *

(Amy narrating)
Ed and I are engaged now.

* I feel love that money
Just can't buy *

I felt bad that he got tore up
over my fictitious
aborted baby.

And I felt bad
about lying to him.

Whenever I would feel the need
to tell him the real truth,

I would think of the image
of my mother wrestling
another woman

in her bra and panties
for Elvis' sexual
gratification.

Or her being banged
by Roy Orbison.

Think how disturbing
that was for me to picture.

How much worse
it would be for my dad
to know the truth.

* Anything at all,
You got it, baby *

It's important to lie.

It's trying to live up
to the lies that we tell
about ourselves

that makes us
better people.

* You got it, baby *

Did you ever have
a dog growin' up?

No, just cats.

* Anything at all *
* You got it *

* Baby *

* You got it **


[Charles Trenet sings
Boum in French]
