Wake up, Los Angeles!

It's 9:02 A.M.
and already 78°

on another beautiful
September Saturday.

It's definitely gonna be a hot one,
boys and girls.

Break out that sunblock
when you hit the beach.

So get out of bed and let's
get this day started.

Over here.

Good morning.
Good morning. What...

What's with all the suits?
Some big dealer thing.

You got two minutes.

How do you feel?

I'm ready.

You fuckin' better be.

Let's go.

Everybody ready?

Was that a roger,
Roger?

Yeah.

Let's do it.
Let's bang a gong.

You're early!
What?

Get your hands
in the air!

Get your hands up!

Oh, fuck.

Shit.

I'm sorry, Mr. Weston.
It's another tough one.

What are you doing here?
You're killing me.

Whoo!
Yeah!

That's like 12 in a row.

That must be some
new local record.

Do me a favor?

You know, the next time,
if you would, don't hit on 16.

Don't distract
the other players.

Oh, there you are,
sweetheart.

I thought you might
have gotten lost.

Hey, what are you
doing after work?

Curing cancer
then grabbing a snack.

You know, Chucky,

it's the little
personal touches

that set this place
apart from the rest.

Yes, sir.

I have half a mind

to stop losing my money
at your establishment.

Let's call it a night,
Mr. Weston.

Oh, come on, guys.

I was getting
on a roll here.

Let's not make a scene.

You know the deal. You've sort of worn
out your welcome for the moment.

I believe you still have some,
uh, unfinished business

with...
Yeah, l... It's okay.

It's okay, 'cause I've
taken care of all that now,

so, if you would
just give me...

a couple hands here,
a chance to win back what I lost...

Now, Mr. Weston.
Chuck.

Hey hey!
Ow ow ow! Ooh!

What the fuck, Chuck?

You have a nice night,
Mr. Weston.

Sweetie, it's just
two more weeks. I know.

But what's the...?

Hon... honey?

Okay, honey, in two weeks
you'll be able to shop until you drop.

But if we don't put
the order in today,

they won't have the Aviator chairs back
in stock for another month.

Sherry, look, don't get
pissed off.

I already explained this to you.
It's just how it has to work.

Roger! You promised me
these types of things

wouldn't be a problem anymore.
Listen, Sherry.

Jason just walked
in so I'll...

we're gonna talk about
this later tonight, okay?

Sherry?

Sherry, we'll talk about
this later tonight, okay?

I love...

What's up?

That's the problem...
nothing's up.

And nothing's gonna
go up.

No shit?

Yeah.

Oh my fucking God.

What the fuck happened?

Check it out yourself.

What the fuck
is this shit?

Vinnie, JTS Brown
in a bucket.

Paulie, cash, on the bar.

Cold night at the tables?

It's fucking Siberia
out there.

But I'm due for
a good run.

How's it going?

Goes in streaks.
Streaks?

Yeah, streaks.

The last good streak you had
was six months ago.

Now you lost all
your scratch...

you're in debt with these
lovely new friends of yours.

I'm gonna pay 'em.

Like you're gonna
pay your bar bill?

Hey.

I was up almost
100 grand.

You know Freddie and
that whole Valari crew.

You got a deathwish
or something?

I can't afford it.

You should have stayed
in San Mateo.

Palo Alto.

Whatever it is. I want to know
what keeps you from going back.

It was too much water.

The wife?

Well, ex-wife,
I guess.

You are legally retarded.

Aw, you know, seemed like
a good idea and all that.

I was finally in a position

where I could give her the kind
of life that she deserved.

I mean, I was making it.

My friend,

you confuse a good run
at the blackjack table

for Shangri-La.

Now your life depends on
whether or not

you're gonna take
a hit on 16.

Well, what's the
dealer showing?

Hey, Vinnie,
how about another one?

I'm cutting you off, kid.

Aw, come on,
give me a break.

Okay, I'll give
you a break...

in the form of a tip:

The Valaris have given you
more rope than they give most.

And if you don't find a way
to pay off these pricks,

they're gonna
hang you with it.

Jesus, Vin,
whatever happened to just

plain old "last call"?

Paulie.

That's always
brought me luck.

Hey hey,
he's on the phone.

Listen, Buster Brown,
when I throw a dog a bone,

I don't want to know
if it's haute cuisine.

Just eat it and say
"Bow-wow."

I don't give a hog's ass
what the analysts say.

If you take that deal over mine,

you're gonna feel like a gnat
fucked by a hippo.

Yeah, well, when
your balls clank,

call me.

Boys, I'm having a shit day.

My housekeeper didn't
wash the socks,

hence I have to wear
black... with blue.

I'm gauche.

What?
I'm working here. What?

We were wondering if you noticed
that Markable Metals was down

12 points today.

BF deal. When the
merger closes on Monday,

it'll go
through the roof.

I think you should check
your end-of-the-day reports.

This merger's not closing.
The hell you say.

Gonad.

As soon as one
of these bondholders alerts the SEC

that this account is empty,
they're gonna be all over us.

They know we
manage the fund.

Whoa whoa whoa.
I don't manage it.

You and Ed do.

My name isn't in there
as a manager.

I didn't move any money
around except for trades.

No, Stephen, you just created
the bogus corporation

that sold the bogus bonds that we've all
been using the bogus profits of.

Besides that, you should
be free-and-fucking-clear.

Doesn't matter now who
did what to whom.

Once they're onto us,
it'll be a matter of nanoseconds

before they find out we've
been remiss to our bondholders.

So...

So, what do we do?

So you guys get the fuck
out of here and leave it to me.

I'll handle it.
But know this:

if MM is really
going south...

we got ourselves a problem.

I should have been a fucking
plastic surgeon.

You should have seen
the way he did that.

Just like on TV.

That really smarts,
doesn't it?

Getting cold-cocked
really fucks you all up.

You get those stars
in front of your eyes.

No fun at all.

Freddie?

We have a little
problem here, Paulie.

Personally...

we feel a little hurt.

Don't we, Bennie?

Downright distraught.

We extend our courtesy
to you at my little casino,

making your stay
in our establishment

probably one of the most
enjoyable of your time.

Then your luck changes.

You come to us for a loan,
we help you out,

and how do you
repay us? You don't.

Oh, that's rude.

That's rude.
I'm not finished. Get him up.

Bennie, stop playing
with him.

It's nice to
have you back.

I don't have any money.

I never did.

What about
your car dealership?

You mean you don't own
a car dealership?

No, I never owned it.

I only sold used cars.

Kid, were you born stupid
or did you learn it somewhere?

Huh?

Oh oh, God.

He's so cute, isn't he?

Isn't he, Bennie?

Look, we know
you have nothing.

We know that you thought
you conned us

into believing that you were the...
the "Wheel King."

The little
"Tire King," yeah?

You were pretty good
at first.

As a matter of fact,
for about a minute

we thought you might
be from the Feds.

But...

the minute you started
to lose and you didn't stop,

we knew you were just another punk who
thought he was on a good roll.

So, you see,

we know the best you might
do is some clunker

down in Palo Alto.

Oh, yeah.

We know where
you come from.

It would take, oh, 20 secondhand cars
to make a dent

in what you owe.

So...

in the course of wondering
how we're gonna deal

with a little...

cheap-shit-
wannabe-bigshot

little fucker

like yourself,

we sent a couple of boys
down there to see

what your situation was...

paid a visit to...

Natalie,
I believe it is.

What did you do...?
Hey.

Do? Paul, what,
you think we're animals?

We're divorced.

Besides, she doesn't
have anything.

Oh, yes, she does.

She has that cute little
blue house all paid for.

You want her to
sell her house?

Oh, no.
You want her to sell the house.

No, l... I never owned
the house.

Oh.

Besides, she won't
help me anymore.

But that wouldn't be
our problem, would it?

That would be your problem.

However, if you
can't deliver,

we might be forced
to do something...

very unpleasant.

Look...

you know what?

Fuck it.

You want to kill me,
go right ahead.

Fuck it. You'll be
doing me a fuckin' favor.

Tempting, but no.

We wouldn't do that,
but we might be forced to...

bring the lovely Natalie
up here for a visit.

Of course, she would
be traveling in a bag of kitty litter.

If you touch her...
Hey.

Look...

You can't ask her
to sell that house.

That's all she has.

If you have another way

of paying
for what is mine,

I'm all for it.

However, you
have one week...

to make things right.

Open it!

Ah... oh!

Shut it.

I know I should say
"I hate to do this,"

but I don't.

Fuck.

Shit.

Shit.

Fuck fuck.

You gonna give yourself
an aneurysm, Roger.

You got to
calm down, son.

That ought to be real easy
with you sneaking up on me.

What'd you find out?

Well, our info is kosher.

The merger was
all set to close.

But the buyers backed off
at the last second

due to a new EPA investigation.
Fucking government.

Stock is down
7.5 points.

That's it then.
We're fucked.

Not necessarily.

What do you mean?

What I mean is, until the end of
the month,

when the statements are generated,

nobody but us is hip to the fact
that that account is empty,

which buys us
a little time.

To do what?

To raise the gelt,

Roger... the cash, the loot.
What? You want to hear it in French?

Well, you know, I really don't have
my share of the $5 million, Ed.

Oh, wait, I'll just go run
to the ATM and...

We all knew it'd be
a gamble, Roger Dodger.

Well, there's
a tune change, Eddie.

You know, what happened to the sure
thing, huh? The inside information.

10 times our money
in a fucking month?

You know something, Roger?

You haven't had a blow job in so long,
you forgot how good it tastes.

You know what this
business is. It's volatile.

It's a risk.
It's never a sure thing,

and don't fucking ever...
call me Eddie.

All right.
Relax, Ed. Jesus.

Relax? I don't know
the etymology of that word,

much less its meaning, Rog.

But I do know the meaning
of the word "remember,"

as in "recall." Seems to me
I recall someone coming to me

saying, "Anything you got, Ed,

anything you got... under
the table, whatever, Ed. I'm in, Ed!

Sherry's giving me
a hard time at home, Ed.

I need the money, Ed."

You're the numbers guy, Rog.
You dig that little syllogism?

"Sherry need money.

Money need Sherry.

Sherry, money, need!"

All right, all right,
all right, all right.

I'm sorry, Ed.

Fucking gonad.

Enough.

Things have been
real great

since the money situation
started to improve.

You know?

She just needs
a little security.

Women don't need security.
Men only think they do.

Women need three things:

Insurmountable attention,
to be licked, and shoes.

Give me the ball.

Look, if we sell now,
we're what,

three-and-a-half,
four million short?

If we're lucky.

Well, that's it, then.
We're fucked.

What if I told you
I got a way

to raise the cash
in less than five days?

I'd say you're fucking nuts.

Have I ever remotely
resembled someone to you who's sane?

I'll tell you this
though: if we pull it off,

get the money back
into the account,

recall the bond,
we're home free.

Two:
I'm listening.

Not here, not now.

You call the boys together.
Meet at my house.

I'll explain
everything then.

Don't worry, Roger Dodger.

It's all gonna be
hunky-dory.

Hunky-dory.
Right.

Fucking gonad.

Yeah, this is Max.

Yeah, Colonel,
it's Koster.

Can't you answer
the phone? Yeah?

Damn, Paul, I thought
you'd never pick up.

Vinnie?

Word is Freddie and her brother
came over to see you last night.

Are you okay?

Define "okay."

Hey, what time is it?

It's just after 2:00.

Do you need a doctor?

More like a welder.

Well, I know somebody
in South Lake...

Dr. Charlie Brooks,

off State Line Drive.
Can you get there?

Yeah, I think so.

Vinnie, they... they
want my wife's house,

or they're gonna...

they said they're gonna...
God, I can't even say it.

Them motherfuckers.

And what if
you were able

to come up with
the cash right now?

Well, gee, I lost
the cash fairy's number.

And Nat's through with me.
She won't help me anymore,

not... not that I blame her
after what I put her through.

All right all right
all right.

There's always a way out.

Look, I'm...
I'm not gambling.

Meet me at the Hit-and-Miss
when you're done.

I might have
something for you.

I told you, Vinnie,
no more gambling.

Well, this ain't gambling.

Hi, I'm Dr. Brooks.

Broken finger.

Did you injure
your vocal cords, too?

Aw, sorry.

l... I was
expecting a man.

Sorry to disappoint you.
Why don't you have a seat, please?

So you were in some
kind of an accident?

I closed it in
a car door.

Car door have a name?

Look, I know you're doing this
as a favor for Vinnie, so...

Actually, you know,
I would have bought the car door,

so I'm gonna
put that down.

That's about what
it would look like.

And what about your nose? You have
a cold or you always sniffle like that?

It got caught in
the door, too.

Burns, doesn't it?

Yeah, okay.
Let's go get you an X-ray.

It's a clean break.
You're lucky it didn't splinter.

You'll have to leave a brace
on for the next six weeks.

And put some of this
in your nose.

Wow, what is that?

It's a sample.
Keep it.

Here's some painkillers.

You know what?
Here's some more.

Feels better just
since you set it.

Yeah, it usually does.

So, were you in the army?

Marines, actually.

But those aren't mine.
They belong to my father.

And where's he stationed?

He's dead.

Is that all right?

Does that feel
all right?

No... yeah, that's fine.

What's wrong?

No, I'm fine.
Let me look.

More car injuries?

It was a damn big door.

Ow.

Nothing's broken.

It's just bruised.

So, do you need
a cab home?

Listen,

I'm a little short on cash.

Well, you're in luck. Wednesday is free
auto-related accident day.

Okay.

Anything else?

No. Thank you.
I mean it.

Don't mention it.

Say hello to
Vinnie for me.

And tell him to stop
smoking those damn cigars.

Well...

I'll see you around.

Keep that finger out
of harm's way.

Listen, this thing
I want to talk to you about...

I think I can help you.

At least I know
a guy who can.

Thanks.

What do I have to do?
Knock somebody off?

Listen, Vinnie, I told you
no more gambling.

And I told you it has
nothing to do with gambling.

But it ain't legal, either.

What are you
getting me into?

Look, I know this guy.

He pulls an occasional job
now and then.

He's a pro.

Nobody fucking move!

All you cocksuckers
on the ground.

He's got something lined up
where he needs a fourth man.

Don't even think about calling the cops,
you fucking whore.

Get down or I'll blow your
fucking head off

and they'll be mopping your brains off
the goddamn pavement.

Go go go!

Can't move without one.
He's got to move quick.

Wait a minute...

I filled him in.

Says he'll use you
on my recommendation.

And your end will take care
of your immediate problems...

and then some.

This guy is good.

All you have to do
is work with him.

Don't get in the way.

Do what he says
and everything will be easy.

Gentlemen.

It's paper.

You promised us a toy.

Shit.

I'm a little confused here.

Are we talking
about armed robbery?

You're insane.
I can't do that.

You... - 

you got to be
fucking kidding.

l...

I think maybe you've
been watching

a little too much
late-night cable, Ed,

but this... this uh...

this ain't
"The Wild Bunch."

Yeah, give me a T1 line
and a keyboard

and I'll make sushi out of a Tokyo
trader's testicles for lunch.

But this?

No no see,
I can't do this.

My boys,
it's pretty simple.

The SEC doesn't take kindly
to floating phony bonds.

So unless one of you have
$5 million stuck away in a shoebox,

I suggest we start organizing
and stop bitching.

Stephen, what about
your family?

Shit.

Yeah, your dad's
worth a fortune.

Oh, what a marvy idea.

Yes, let's call up
Stephen's daddy.

I'm sure the senator
will appreciate that,

especially in
an election year.

Yeah, well, I don't
think that's gonna work out.

"Hello, Daddy,
it's Stephen.

Listen, I was wondering if
you could slip me $5 million

to pay back grandmothers
I bamboozled.

Oh, you can?

Well, goodie,
that should about do it.

Bye."

That'll go over like a turd
in a punch bowl, brothers.

Plus which, there'd be a paper trail
longer than the federal tax code

leading from the senator
right back to us.

And the SEC and
the IRS and the FBI will be following it

like smoke out of
the ass of a semi.

My way is clean.

My way is complete.

Two weeks from now
we're back at our desks making loot.

Now, that's what you want, isn't it?
Make some loot,

stay out of jail?

If so, this is the way.
This is the only way.

No, God damn it.

Hey hey.
Sit.

Sit down.
Yeah.

Sit the fuck down.

I'm not a thief.

I can't put a gun to somebody's head
and say, "Hand it over."

I put my neck on
the chopping block for you

and you're gonna act this way?
What are you gonna do?

Work it off?

If I have to.

What are you gonna do?
Be a pit boss?

A house manager?

A clarinet player?

Jesus,

you got nothing else.
You got nothing left.

You're gonna do what
Freddie wants you to.

Offer up your ex's house,
maybe even her,

or get in on this

and settle with Freddie
and have something left over.

Personally, I would suggest
a down payment

on a new life
in San Mateo.

Palo Alto.

Listen, if you got
a guy on the inside,

you know, and he's just
gonna hand 'em over anyway,

why do we got to put on this big show
of robbing the place?

Because my guy
ain't in this

for the shits and
giggles, Roger.

My guy needs a robbery.

He can't just say,
"Oops, gee,

I lost $15 million worth of diamonds.
Can you send some more over?"

He needs a robbery
with witnesses,

with guns, with cops.

Plus which, those diamonds
are gonna be in his shop

for about two hours before
they're allocated

and dispersed to the retailers.

So, this ain't
an absolute lock.

An absolute lock, Jason?

What, have you been going to
Roger's School of the Sure Thing?

No, Jason!
I'm sorry.

I can't come up with
a multimillion dollar

absolute fucking lock!

Jesus!

You guys absolutely
fucking slay me.

We log on,
make a few phone calls...

two weeks later,
250 geriatrics

hand over their entire
life's savings

and that's okay.
"But gee, Ed,

I don't wanna be
a real crook."

We always intended
to pay that money back, Ed.

And how were we gonna
pay back the money, Stephen?

From the trading account.

And the trading account
is what, Stephen?

It's almost empty.

Excuse me?

Empty.
Thank you, Stephen.

Your voice was muffled,
you had your head so far up your ass.

The trading account
is empty, earth people.

Which leads me back to
question alpha:

How do we get the scratch?

Which leads me back
to plan A.

Speaking of plan A, Ed...

not to look a gift horse
in the mouth...

Then don't look a gift horse
in the mouth, Roger.

What, you think
we're the only folks

that need a shitload of
change yesterday?

My guy's been waiting for
something like this a long time.

A long time... except it's
very difficult

to find folks
who will pull it off.

But we can pull it off, see?
This is it.

So grow up!

You got a better plan?
No, you do not.

So, get some balls
that clank,

and let's get to work.

Alrighty?

I don't know, Vinnie.
I just can't do it.

Can't do what?
Play softball.

The bar's forming
a league for softball.

Man.

You sure fixed
my boy up good.

That's what I do.
May I?

Yes yes.

Let me help you there.

Thanks again for...
for everything.

Yeah, car doors
can be hell.

So what brings you here?

I was supposed to
meet some friend

after their shift change
at the Valarian.

I think I got stood up.

Yeah, and I saw my
patient over here,

and I thought maybe
I should check up on him.

So, how are those
painkillers working?

Oh,

a few more minutes, you might be able to
have your way with me.

Why do you think
I came over?

Look, I gotta go.

Good to see you again.
Thanks, Vinnie.

Paul?

I need your answer
tomorrow by noon,

and it better
be positive.

Need a ride,
cowboy?

Aw, no thanks.

My horse is
just around the corner.

Come on, get in the car.
You're full of drugs.

You're gonna
kill yourself,

or worse,
your horse.

That's okay,
my horse is sober.

Hey, I am your doctor.
You have to do what I say.

Listen, I'm sorry I laughed
at you back there, okay?

Hasn't been my week.

Well, the week's
still young.

So, are you
enjoying Tahoe?

I guess you must be really
having a tough time.

Well, for what
it's worth,

I've treated a lot
of Vinnie's friends,

but you're the first one
that I've ever given a ride to.

Ah.

So, out of all the losers,
I'm your favorite one.

Without a doubt.

Okay, I gotta ask...

so... so why didn't you
just take the money and run?

Well, it's nice to know
Vinnie can keep a secret.

Why didn't I just
take the money and run?

Well, I guess the stock
answer to that question is

it's not about the money.
It's about the power, the rush.

Okay.

But that's bullshit.

It is about the money.
Okay, so...

So, why didn't I just
quit while I was ahead?

Ha, 'cause you
never know.

The most cash I'd ever
seen in my life

was $2,500,

and it was a commissions check,
and that was before taxes.

New Year's Eve,
I was sitting behind $95,000.

Now, three days later,
it was $80,000.

Now, that's pretty good,
but it's not... it's not 95.

And so on, and so on,
until it's...

it's not just the money
you've lost, but it's the job,

the girl,
the self-respect.

The girl?
Oh, yeah, there's always a girl.

Wife, actually.

She became part of
all the deals I was making.

Deals?
Deals with who?

Aw, fate, God, whoever.

Natalie, my wife...

she just wanted to
have a family,

and a little house.

That wasn't good
enough for me.

I wanted the
American Dream, you know?

I was in a dead-end job
and I came up here on a whim.

And I just started
raking in the money.

It was unbelievable.

Okay, so now you had
80 grand...

No, it was only
60 grand at that point.

Only.

She begged me to stop.

Ah, and I swore
that I would.

But I just knew if I had
one more good run,

I could get all that money back.
I just knew that I could.

The sad thing was,
I was still making deals,

even after the money
was all gone

and she had told me
to get lost.

Well.
Yeah.

It's pretty damn impressive.

Hello?
Colonel Max, it's Koster.

Are we set?
Yes, sir,

we're all set to come through
the door at 0910 hours.

Very good.

Remember that you can be inside
no more than two minutes.

That's affirmative, sir.
We're ready.

Ah, my contact is set to
get 60¢ on the dollar,

and we will rendezvous at
the safe house in two weeks.

Alrighty,
sounds good to me.

Oh, and Ed, l...
I appreciate this.

I would not ask
this of you

if there were
any other options.

No need to
explain, sir.

I can't say I'm not
having fun.

Look, you kind of
caught me in an off year.

Thanks for the ride.

What, no drink?

I don't have
anything here.

l... I just want to make sure
you'll be okay.

Sure.

Would you excuse me
for a minute?

Sure.

It's the best I could do.
Thank you.

Yeah, I wasn't planning
on entertaining tonight.

Make yourself comfortable.

I always do.

So...

have you lived
in Tahoe long?

About a year.

Do you like it?

Well, take it or leave it.

Was it hard to
become a doctor?

Well, you do have to
go to medical school.

Hey, I'm sorry
I brought up your father.

l... I didn't mean to.

Oh, no, that's okay.

I'm just still
very sensitive.

It hasn't been that long
and we were very close.

So, um...

so, how long were
you married?

A little over
three years.

And when did you
get divorced?

Couple of months ago.

Really?
Yeah.

And you?
Have you ever been married?

No.

No, I never found
the right guy.

Oh.

Besides, the...

the guys that come
into my office...

they're usually
not my type.

And what is your type?

Hello?

Paul?

Nat, is that you?

It's me.

Are you okay?
I'm fine.

You?

How... how did you
find me?

Your friends gave
me the number.

My friends?

Yeah.
They came by.

They were looking at the house,
asking all these weird questions.

Did...
did they do anything?

I thought we were done
with all of this, Paul.

You said you'd walk away
and leave me alone.

You said that.

l... l...

I know, I'm...
Nat, did... what did they say?

Listen, don't go thinking
you can borrow against the house again.

Look, Nat...

I'm in... I'm in trouble.
No no. Not again.

My father left me this house
so I wouldn't have to worry,

and there is no way in hell
I am going to let you ruin that.

l... I'm sorry, Nat...

You... look,
you're in trouble.

Don't start.

It wasn't supposed to
be like this.

I know.

I've got a new life now.

Time to move on.

I'm... I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. You're right,
I'll take care of it.

I'll leave you alone.

I miss you, Nat.
Don't, Paul.

I wish...

What?
Just...

take care of yourself.

Sherry?

Honey?

What the fuck?

Sherry?

This is...

Yeah?

Roger?
Hey, it's Jason.

Ah, Jason.

Jason, you know,
this really isn't a good time.

Why, what's wrong?

Oh...

You know, I don't know.
I may be in prison

inside of a month,

and...

oh, yeah,

my wife... she seems
to have left me.

Whoa whoa.
Why? What happened?

Hell, you know what?
Let's ask Ed.

He seems to have
his finger on the pulse

of just about
fucking everything.

God damn it.

I don't even know what to say.
Did she leave a note?

Took the furniture.
Pretty big clue.

Oh, shit.

Yeah, man, shit.

You know, Ed was right.

Hmm, Ed was fucking right,
you know?

I should have
seen this coming.

It was always about the money
and the lack of it.

Fuck.

Oh, fuck.

She took the big screen!

So what are you
gonna do?

I don't know, since this just happened
about five fucking minutes ago,

I really have no idea.
Hey, maybe I'll burn the house down,

since it usually
comes in threes.

So, what good news
do you have?

Shit, man...

I don't even want to
bring it up now,

but Ed wants us to come out
to the cabin Friday after work.

You know, planning
and all that stuff.

Of course he does.
Have to keep on a tight schedule.

Can you make it?

Hold on.

Let me ask my wife.

Sherry honey?

I have to go meet up
with the guys on Friday

to talk about this robbery
we're planning

to get back
the money I lost

trying to keep you
from leaving me.

Okay?

Yeah yeah,
that shouldn't be a problem.

Hey hey.

Remember what
I told you:

This guy is a pro.

And if you have any second
thoughts about getting out,

now's the time to do it.
Because once you're in, you're in.

You can't get out of it
like a job offer.

One more thing:
the vig is

I get 10% of your in.

'Course you do.

Thank you.

Here's Paul.

Come on.

I'm gonna take
a walk outside.

You rolled Freddie Green,

and all she did was
break your little digit.

Man, are you lucky.

She must really
like you, son.

What do you want?

Vinnie said I could get in
on a job with you.

What else he say?

He didn't know all the details.

Do you want to know
all the details?

Yeah, I want to.

Pretty simple, actually.

If you want in,

you're in.

If you want out,

that's the door.

And if you fuck up,

then I will kill you.

Now,

are you in or out?

I'm in.

I like that.

I like that.

You are in.

I like you.

You've got a shot.
Hi.

I'm Todd,
I'm the wheel man.

Oh, sorry.

Let's start again.

"I'm Todd."

I'm Todd.

"And I'm an asshole."

And I'm an asshole.

And you will not
speak again

until you are told
to speak.

And I will not speak again
until I am told to speak.

"And this is because..."
And this is because...

"I don't come into
a room

whenever I want to
and introduce myself to people

as a wheel man
or anything else."

Is that what you do?
You walk into a fucking casino

and you say, "Yeah,
wheel man on the end.

I fold at 16.

I'm not gonna go
for 21.

I fold at 16. I just wanted you to
know that's what I do."

You're a fucking asshole.

You know, this sucks.

Huh?
I mean, Jesus Christ.

I mean, look at us.

We drove all the way up
to a cabin to practice for a robbery,

when we should be fucking
playing golf, man.

Yeah, it's a little
over our heads.

But, it is a way out, man.

Yeah.

Let's talk about that.

Doesn't it seem
a little odd to you?

What?
Ed.

Look, he... he got us
into this, and what?

It takes him what, about a whole day
to figure out a way out?

Isn't that just
a little too convenient?

Huh? It's almost like he wanted this
investment to go south.

Yeah, but why?

I don't know.

Maybe to give himself
permission to do something

exactly like this.

Come on, Roger, don't you think
you're reaching just a little bit?

Maybe, but you
got to admit, man,

he's a little too much
into that army shit.

It's like time stood still the day
he was fucking discharged.
