Girl: Isn't It Funny
How People On Tv

Lead The Most
Amazingly Perfect Lives?

Lucky Them, Huh?

Anyway, That's Me With
My Twin Brother, Eddie.

Can You Tell I'm Obsessively
Attached To My Camera?

My Dad Says If I Could've,

I Probably Would've
Filmed My Own Birth.

And My Friends?

They Love
Being In My Movies.

Come On, Just
Jump Up There And Do It.

You Do It.


Denisey?

No.

Don't You Think

We're Getting A Little Too Old For This?

Come On.

You Two Would
Make The Perfect

Tragic Romantic Couple.

Jakey.

I'm King
Of The World.


Cut. Great.

I'm Not
Doing It Again.

Why Not?

'Cause We're
In High School Now,

And I Have A Reputation
To Protect.

Since When?

In Case
You Haven't Noticed,

Tru Won't Be Happy

Until She Turns
Her Entire Life

Into A Sitcom.

And Here's Another Thing:

On Tv, No Matter
How Gigantic Your Problems Are,

By The Final Commercial,
Everything's Wrapped Up.

Everybody's Happy.

Who Wouldn't
Want To Live Like That?

Yeah, But Talk About Totally Predictable And Boring.

Hey, Reality's Harsh.

I Would Much Rather
Live Inside The Tube.




Paparazzi!
Paparazzi, Tru!

Stop It Now, Eddie.
You're Gonna--

Paparazzi!
Paparazzi!

Paparazzi!

Give Me The Camera.
You Are Not A Paparazzi.

Paparazzi!

Stop It! Eddie!

Hey, Hey, Hey,
Stop It! Stop!

Knock It Off!

What Is Going On Here?

He Came
Jumping Out At Us,

Shooting This Thing
Off In Our Faces.

Uh, Maybe We Ought
To Take Off.

No. Come On. You Guys
Don't Have To Go.

Denise: No, It's Ok.

I'll Call You
Tomorrow.


Ugh!

Mmm.

Mmm.


Proud Of Yourself?

I'm Sure He Didn't
Mean Any Harm, Tru.

That's What
You Always Say.

I Only Wanted
To Be Funny.

Well, You Weren't, Ok?

I Mean, I've Got, Like,
Big White Spots In Front Of My Eyes,

And You Chased Away
My Friends, Eddie.

Can You
Say You're Sorry, Honey?

Sorry.

Forgive Me, Tru?

All Right.

Good.

Eddie, How About
You Go And Work

On Your Map Project, Huh?

It's In The Den.

[Clears Throat]

Why Do You
Have To Act Like This?

Me? If I Shot A Flash
Off In His Eyes,

You Would Ground Me
For A Month.

Yeah, Because
You Know Better.

So Does He.

Mom, You Let Him Get
Away With Everything.

Eddie Was Only Trying To Get Your Attention.

He Feels Left Out

When You're Here
With Your Friends.

So Whatever He Does
Is Just Perfectly Fine,

But I Can't
Do Anything Right?

Is That What I Just Said?

You Don't
Have To Say It.

It's Totally
All Over Your Face.

Tru.

Forget It.

Leave Me Alone.


Tru: Hi, Mom.

Oh, Honey.

I Don't Think
I've Had A Chance Today

To Tell You How Very
Proud Of You I Am.

Thanks, Mom.

Seriously, Tru,

You're Brilliant,
You're Adorable,

And You Have The Best Taste In Clothes.

Well, Then, Mom,

I Think You And Dad
Should Increase My Allowance

By $100 A Week.

Sure.

Ok, Here's The Deal.

The More I Wish My Life
Could Be Like A Sitcom...

The More It Turns
Into A Soap Opera.

I Mean, I Can't
Really Even Talk To My Mom

Because Not Only Does She
Totally Not Get Me,

But She's Always So Busy
Dealing With Eddie.

Then There's My Dad.

Do You Know He Actually
Operates On People's Brains?

Eww. That's How Gross?

Ech.

Anyway, He's
Hardly Ever Here,

And Frankly,

Sometimes I Think He
Likes It Better That Way.

Anyway,

Does It Seem
A Little Bit Psycho

That I'm Keeping
This Video Journal?

Not To Me.

In Fact, Here's 101 Reasons
Why I'm Doing It.

Reason One:

When I'm Incredibly Famous
And Have My Own Show,

I'll Put This Journal
Out On Video

So Everybody Can See What
My Life Was Really Like.

Reason 2...

In Case Foreign Agents
Break In

And Drain My Memory,

I'll Still Have This Tape
As A Record Of My Life.

Reason 3...

I Really,
Really Need Something

That's Completely
And Privately Mine.

Anyway, I Haven't
Actually Come Up

With Reasons 4-101 Yet,

But I Promise When I Do,

I'll Get Back To You.

Eddie:
Fork. Knife. Spoon.

Is Dad Home Yet?

No.

One Of His Patients Had Some
Sort Of Post-Op Complication.

Jeez. I Can't Even Imagine
Being A Surgeon Like He Is.

That's Why We
Have To Be Really Mellow

When He Gets Home.

What's For Dinner?

Chicken.

Twice-Baked Potatoes,

Broccoli.

No, No, No.
Tru, We Need.

No.

We Need--
Yes, We Do.

Eddie, We Don't
Need Those--

We Do Need 'Em.

Miss Tar
Said That's

How You Set
The Table.

But Tonight,
We Don't Need Them.

Fork, Knife, Spoon.
We Need Them, Tru.

Eddie, No.

We Need Them.

Hey, Let Him
Set The Table

The Way He Wants, Ok?

Mom, It's My Night
To Do The Dishes.

I Don't Want To Have
To Wash Something

That We're
Not Even Gonna Use.

If It's Such A Big Deal,
I'll Do The Dishes.

That's Not The Point.

I Think The Point Is

You Want To Argue
About Everything Today.

You Know,
You're So Worried

About Not Hurting
Eddie's Feelings

That You Act Like I Don't Have Any Feelings At All.

Note To Self:

When I Do Make A Tv Show
Out Of My Life,

Remind Me To Cast Somebody Else As My Mom.

Reasons Why I Think
Eddie Might Be

The Most Well-Adjusted One
In Our Entire Family:

First, Eddie Would
Never Go Out Of The House

Without Bothering
To Look In The Mirror...

Like Some People I Know.

And Then What About The Way

She Always Has To Ask

The World's Most
Embarrassing Questions?

Excuse Me. Hi.

Are These Tomatoes
Really Organic?

Or Do You Just, Like,
Put The Sign Up There

To, You Know,
Take Advantage

Of Environmentally-Conscious
Women Like Myself?

Tru: And You'd
Never Catch Eddie

Packing Left-Over
Chinese Food

And Chopsticks In My Lunch.

Oh, Check Out The Note

In Totally Fake
Chinese Writing

That Has The Translation
On The Back.

Could She Possibly Be
Any Cornier?

I--I'm Really Serious.

I Want To Know
If They're Organic Or Not.

Tru And Everybody
Came Home,

And I Was Really Funny.

Paparazzi! Paparazzi!

Remember, Tru,
When I Said It?

Papa-Who?

Tru: He's
Saying Paparazzi, Dad.

You Know, Like
Celebrity Photographer.

Paparazzi, Oh.
Paparazzi, That's Funny.

That Was
Real Funny, Huh?

Funny.

It's Funny.
It's Funny.

It Wasn't Funny.

Mom, Could You Pass Me
The Broccoli, Please?

Mm-Hmm.

Thank You. Oh.

Oh! Not Again!

Mom: It's Ok, Honey.

Sit Down. I Got It.

It's Not As If We Can
Eat The Broccoli Now.

It's All Covered
With Glass.

I'm Sorry, Dad.


Come Here.

Come Here.

Hey, You Know What?

One Of These Days,

We're Gonna Go Through
An Entire Meal

Without Dropping
Or Breaking Anything.

I Know
It's Gonna Happen.

Right.

Come On.
It's Ok. Sit Down.

Tru: Did You Know
It's Fairly Common

For Baby Sharks

To Attack Each Other
In The Womb?

It's True.
We Learned It In Science.

[Shark Belches]

Stop!

Tru: What If Everything
That's Wrong With Eddie

Is All My Fault?

Mom Says It's Not True,
But How Does She Know?

I Mean, I'm The Twin
Who Was Born First.

Maybe Everything Would've
Been Different

If I'd Let Eddie
Out Ahead Of Me.

My Twin Brother Has
A Developmental Disability.

Now That We're
Starting High School,

I Think It Would Be
Really Cool

If I Could Find Some Way

To Make Him More Comfortable

And Accepted In The World.

If Anybody Has Any Ideas
On How To Help Him Out,

I'd Really Appreciate
Hearing From You.

Tru W.

[Bell Rings]

Tru: Can You Stand It?

Billy Meyer And I
Totally Connected.

He's, Like,
The Hottest Junior Ever,

And I'm Just
A Lowly Freshman,

But He Completely
Stopped To Talk To Me.

What'd He Say?

Hey, Kid, Is There
An Assembly Today?

Wow.

That Proves It.

He Has To Be
In Love With You.

It Means
He Knows I'm Alive.

Hey, Guys,
I've Got The Dirt On Something

You Are Definitely Gonna
Want To Hear About.

I Hope It's Not
About Billy Meyer.

What About Billy Meyer?

Nothing.
She's Delirious.

She Has No Idea
What She's Talking About.

She's Right.
I'm A Total Buffoon.

Aah! Don't Tell Me

You're In Love
With That Jerk.

I'm Not, Ok?

Do You Have News,
Or Don't You?

Well, What'll
You Give Me For It?

Forget It.

[Bell Rings]

Hey, Where
Are You Going?

Homeroom's This Way.

Denise: Come Along, Jakey.

Forgive Him.
He's New To The Planet.

Aah!

Sorry. Sorry.


Sorry.


My Bad. Sorry.

Yeah. No Problem.

Tru: Could I Be
A Bigger Freak?

Tell You One Thing:

If I Had Billy Meyer
For My Boyfriend,

My Life Would Be Perfect.

Tru-Cy, I'm Home!

Hi, Honey.

How Was Your Day?

Terrible.

I Got Fired From My Job,

I Wrecked The Car,

And We're A Week Late
On The Mortgage.

Oh, Darling, How Awful.

But Why All The Presents?

As Long As I Have You
For My Sweetie,

Nothing Can Get Me Down.

All: Aww.

Hey.

Jake: Hey, Tru!

Hey.

Hi.

Liverwurst.

Eww.

Hey, So, Remember
The News I Said I Had?

How About We Trade?

Info For Drumstick.

Pass.

Fine.

Look, Aren't You The One

Who's Always Babbling
About Being A Big Tv Star?

Tru's Gonna Be
A Star.

A Big,
Humongous Star.

Yeah. Well,

I Might Know A Way
You Can Make That Happen.

Mom! Mom! Guess What?
It's A Miracle.

It's The Chance
Of A Lifetime!

Wtuv Is Having
A Contest For Kids,

And The Winner Gets
To Host Their Own Tv Show.

Are You Fully
Comprehending This?

I'm Gonna Be On Tv!

Well, You Know,
They're Probably

Gonna Get
A Few Hundred Entries.

So?

So I Don't Want You
To Be Devastated

If You Don't Win.

Nice Vote Of Confidence.
Thanks A Ton, Mom.

Baby, I'm Only Trying
To Be Realistic.

Well, I'd Rather
Have You Be Supportive.

Well, It Sounds Great.

Ok, Titles For
My Award-Winning Tv Show:

How About<I>
Tru Life Adventures?

So It's Not Just
Tru Like Me,

It's True Like Real.

Get It?

No.

<I>The Tru Troupe.
Tru Stories.

<I>Nypd Tru.

<I>Mad About Tru.
Tru Tales.

<I>Tried And Tru.<I>
True Blue Tru.

<I>Tru Wants To Be
A Millionaire?


I Need To Keep Thinking.

Teacher: Ok, Guys,
Write This Down.

Essays On <I>The Pearl
Are Due On Friday.

And By Monday,

I Want To Hear The Titles
And The Authors

For Your Next Book Report
So I Can Sign Off On Them.

The Answer, Jake, Is No.

Comic Books And Graphic
Novels Don't Count.


What, You Didn't Know
I Was Psychic?

[Bell Rings]

All Right.
See Y'all Tomorrow.

Mr. Taylor,

I Told You About
The Wtuv Contest.


9 Or 10 Times
In The Last Few Days.

Well, I'm Doomed.

I Mean, I Really
Need Your Help,

'Cause I Want To Do Something Original And Great,

But Every Idea
I Come Up With Stinks.

What Do I Tell You Guys
When You're Writing?

Write What You Know.

Right. So Why Not
Apply That Same Concept

To Your Filmmaking?

Forget About Being Clever.

Go For Real.

Ginny, I Got
The Photo Layout For You.

Ginny?

This Is Strange.

What Is It?

I Was Looking
For Some Information

On Music Classes
For Eddie,

And I Came Across A Posting That Tru Put Up.

What Does She Want?

Help For Her Brother.

Really?

A Way To Make Him

Feel More Comfortable
In The World.

You Know, It Used To Be

When She Was Worried
About Stuff Like That,

I Was The One That
She Came Running To.

Not Anymore.

Sweetie, When You
Were Her Age,

How Often Did You
Confide In Your Mother?

Never.

You Know
This Is Different.

I Mean, She And I Have
Always Been So Close.

Now, It's...

All She Ever Does
Is Yell At Me.

Everything I Do Is
Either Stupid Or Wrong.

I Have No Idea
When I Turned Into

The Most Annoying Mom
On The Planet.

She's 14.

You're Lucky
She Hasn't Moved Out

Or Gotten Her Own Apartment.

Yet.

Mm-Hmm.

You Know What Sucks?

Don't Use That Word.

It Sounds Awful.

Do You Know What Stinks?

Having A Boy For A Twin

Means I'll Never
Get To Do Cool Stuff.

You Know,
Like In <I>The Parent Trap?

We Could Never Swap Dates

Or Take Tests
For Each Other.

We Can't Even
Fool You And Dad.

What's The Point
Of Even Having A Twin?

Shouldn't You Be Focused

On Finishing
Your Homework?

Ugh. Don't You Care
That I'm Being, Like,

Incredibly Profound Here?

Eddie: Look At Me.

I'm A Doctor Like Daddy.

Hey.

Want To See Me
Do An Operation?

We'd Love To.

Uh-Oh. Broken Brain.


Paging Doctor Eddie.

Paging Doctor Eddie.

Eddie: Broken Brain.

That Sounds Serious,
Doctor.

Shh. I'll Make You
All Better.

[Tru Screams]

Ow! No, Doctor!
You're Hurting Me.

Aah!

Rrr. Rrr. Rrr.

[Imitating Drill]

Aah!

Dad: What's
Going On Here?

I, Um...

Eddie: I...

It's All Right,
Eddie. It's Ok.

He Was Performing A Very Delicate Operation.

Eddie, Those Tools
Are Antiques.

They Were A Gift
From My Father.

When Did We Decide
They Were Toys?

Mom: He's Being Careful.

I'm Not A Doctor.

Doctors Are Mean.

Dad: I Don't Know
What You Want From Me.

It's Like Everything I Do With This Kid Is Wrong.

It's All About Your Tone.

Tone.

You Scare Him.
You Intimidate Him.

Well, At Least
I Don't Baby Him.

I Give Him Help
When He Needs Help.

Look...

Unless We Start
Raising The Bar,

How Can We Expect Him
To Jump Any Higher?

This May Be It, Bob.

No, I Will
Not Accept That.

Each Of These Kids
Is Different.

There's No Rule Book.
There's No Handbook.

If We Get Lazy

And Quit Pushing Him,

He's Liable
To Stop Growing

Simply Because
We Let Him.

Yeah, But He's
Already Gone

Way Beyond
People's Expectations.

Nobody Thought He'd End Up
In A Mainstream School.

Exactly, So Why Not
Rewrite All The Rules?

As Long As We Don't
Lose Sight Of Reality.

Do You Happen To Remember What I Do For A Living?

I Face More Reality
Every Single Day

Than Most People Have
To Face In A Lifetime,

So I'd Really
Appreciate It

If You Didn't Lecture Me

On Coming To Grips With
My Son's Limitations.

Eddie!

Eddie!


Tru.


Ok, Ok.



Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

Ok. Ok.
Everything's Ok.

Ok, Pal, Here We Go.

You Throw It,
I Catch It.

Ok. Ready?

Fire Away.

Ok.

Strike One!


Good Throw, Son.

Ok.

Ok, Here You Go. Ready?

Here We Go.

Got It.

Good Catch.

Ok.

Ok. Try And Get This One

In The Glove Right Here.

Aim Right For The Mitt.
Right For The Mitt.

Here We Go.

Â™ª I Need Love â™ª

â™ª To Lift Me Up â™ª

â™ª And I Need Time â™ª

â™ª To Tell Me What To Do â™ª

â™ª And It's Been
A Long Ride â™ª

â™ª And I Can't
Make It Through â™ª

â™ª Oh Oh Oh â™ª

â™ª All I Want â™ª

â™ª And All I Need â™ª

â™ª Is To Be Strong â™ª

â™ª Can Anybody
Take My Hand â™ª

â™ª And Let Me Know The Way â™ª

â™ª To Face Another Day? Â™ª

â™ª Won't Somebody
Take My Hand â™ª

â™ª And Lift Me
Off The Ground? Â™ª

You're Terrible.

What Do You Say

We Forget About
All This Exercise Baloney

And Go Get Ourselves
Some Hot Fudge Sundaes?

Yeah! Yeah!

Last One To The Car
Is A Rotten Egg.


Rotten Egg!

The Question, Dear,

Isn't What's Wrong
With Your Brother.

It's What's Wrong With You?

There's No Cure For
The Mentally Handicapped.

You Simply Need To Develop
A Strong Sense Of Faith.

Hey, Tru.
Choppy L.A. Here.

My Son Sounds A Lot
Like Your Brother.

Our School Board

Was Really Cool
About Helping.

Maybe Yours
Could Be, Too.

Good Luck, Huh?

Deedee: Dear Tru,

All I Know Is This:

If Your Brother Has A Sister
As Caring As You,

He's Already
10 Times Better Off

Than Most Kids
With His Handicap.

Listen,

As Long As You
Continue To Support Him

And Love Him,

Everything Else
Will Be Fine.

Any Time
You Want To Talk,

I'm Here.

Thanks, Deedee.

[Bell Rings]

Do You Think Billy Meyer
Would Be In My Film?

Yeah, Maybe, If You Promised
To Let Him Be The Star.

Really, That Guy
Is So Into Himself.

Fine. Whatever.
I'm Just Trying

To Come Up With
A Good Idea Here.

I Mean, All I'm Saying
Is This Contest

Could Be The Beginning
Of The Rest Of My Life.

P.A.: Ladies And Gentlemen,
Please Remain

Behind The Yellow Line
Until...

Anyway,
Mr. Taylor Told Me

To Make It About Something
I Know Really Well,

But Everything I Know
Is Incredibly Boring.

Hey, Make It
About Us.

We're Incredibly
Fascinating.

You're So Lame, Jake.
Get Off Me.

Ok, What If I Did, Like,
Some Hilarious Movie Parody?

That's What
Everybody Will Do.

Well, I Can't Do Animation,
'Cause That Would Be Way Too Hard.

And I Don't Want To Do, Like,
Some Hip Music Show,

'Cause The Judges Are Probably All Old Like My Parents.

Hold On. I Might
Have Just Hit

On The Most
Brilliant Idea Ever.

Well, Tell Us.

Why, So You Can
Just Dump On It?

No. Make Sure
Eddie Gets Home.

I Have To Go
Do Research.

Tru.

Where's Tru Going?

I Guess
When Inspiration Hits,

You Gotta Go With It.

Good-Bye.

Tru: Oh, Jeez. A Little
Help Out Here, Please?

Oh, What Is This?

Here You Go.
I Got This.

Thanks.

What Are You Doing
Home So Early?

Well, 2 Consultations
Canceled,

Surgery Postponed,
Here I Am.

Great, 'Cause I Really
Need Your Help.

Well, It Looks Like Quite
A Project. Science?

No. The Contest.

I Told You,
Remember?

Host Your Own
Tv Show?

Wtuv.

Ringing
Any Bells Here?

I'm Sorry, Hon.

Ok. I'm Gonna Do One
Of Those Magazine Shows

To Teach People
About Kids Like Eddie--

How They Get That Way
And What Doctors

Are Doing
To Try To Help Them.

Stuff Like That.

Which Is Why
I Really Need Your Help.

Can You Get Me One Of Your
Doctor Friends To Interview?

Somebody Really Smart Who Would Look Good On Tv

And Has Excellent
Credentials.

Ew. Dad. No.

I'm Trying To Be Professional,
Not Pathetic.

Oh. Thanks A Lot.

It's Just--

Would Katie Couric
Use Her Dad?

I Don't Know.
Is Her Dad A Neurosurgeon?

Eddie: Dad! Dad, Look!
I'm Doing It!

Oh! Whoa!

Daddy, I'm Doing It!
Come Outside With Me, Dad.

You're Not Supposed To Rollerblade In The House.

Daddy, Come Outside!

[Pager Beeps]

Hold On Just
One Second, Pal.

[Doorbell Rings]

I'm Going
Real Fast, Dad. See?

Dad! Whoa!


Look, I'm Doing It, Dad!

Hi.

Grocery Guy Delivery.

Eddie: Daddy,
Come Outside!

Where Do You
Want 'Em?

Just Put Them
Right Over There.

Tru, Look, I'm Doing It!
I've Learned.

Eddie,
Be Careful! Aah!

Oh! Oh!

Pick That Stuff Up,
Will You, Please?

I Didn't Spill It!

Did I Ask You Who Spilled It?
Pick It Up.

Whoa! Dad!

Wait. My Dad Still
Needs To Tip You.

I'm--I'm Sorry, Stacia.
Who's In 5 North?

Ow! Eddie, You Skated
Right Over My Fingers!

Hi!

Whoa!

Eddie, You Hurt Me!
What Were You Thinking?

He Ran Over
My Fingers, Dad!

Dad, Come Out!

I--I Gotta Go.

Uh, Just--Just Hold On.
Here, I'll--

Eddie: Look, I'm Going
Real Fast! Come And See!

Sorry About
All The Craziness.

Come Outside Now?

Mommy! Hi, Mom! Look.

All Yours.

I Have To Go
To The Hospital.

Dad!

We'll Talk Later.

Tru!
What's Up, Doc?

Get It, Tru?

Aah!

Hi, Darling.

Hi.

[Tru Grunts]

[Garbage Disposal Grinding]

Ginny: Trudy
Elizabeth Walker...

What In The World
Is The Matter With You?

[Disposal Stops]

Why Can't It Ever Just Be
Normal Around Here, Mom?

That Was Billy Meyer
Delivering The Groceries.

Billy Meyer!

I Don't Care Who It Was.

That Doesn't Give You The Right
To Destroy Perfectly Good Food.

I'm Sorry, Ok?

Aah!

Eddie: Come On!
Come On, Dad!

I'm Coming! I'm Coming
To Get You! Here I Come!

I Won!

Did You Tell Tru
It's Dinner?

Yeah. She Said She'd
Be Down In A Minute.

Did She Tell You What
Happened After You Left?

Yeah. I Got The Gist.

Mmm... Carrots.

Yum.

Carrots. Yum.

Oh, Gin, Oh,
These Are Delicious.

Oh, You've Outdone
Yourself This Time.

Aren't They Good, Mom?

A Little Thin.
A Little Dry.

I'm Going To Have
To Give Them A 5.5.



Nothing Higher.
Maybe Billy Meyer

Might Give It
A Higher Score, But--

Oh, Tru!

Oh, Billy Meyer.

Tru: "Dear Deedee:

"You Said I Could
Get Back To You

"Whenever I Felt Like It,
So Here I Am.

"I Got Home
From School Today

"Buried In Homework,

"Stressed About Getting My
Tape Done By The Deadline...

"Mom Too Busy
To Hear About Any Of It.

"And There's Eddie...

"Totally Content...

"Which Made Me Think...

"I Spend So Much Time
Watching Out For Him

"And Worrying About Him,
But Who's To Say?

"Maybe He's Luckier
Than Any Of Us.

"He Knows He'll Always
Be Taken Care Of.

"He Goes Along
At His Own Speed.

"I'm Not Saying
His Handicap's A Good Thing,

"But Let's Face It.

Most Of The Time,
He's Happier Than Anybody I Know."

Â™ª Oh, Yeah, Yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, Yeah, Yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, Yeah, Yeah â™ª

â™ª Oh, Yeah, Yeah... â™ª

Go On, Eddie.
Just Do It.

Â™ª The Waking Sun
Like No Alarm â™ª

â™ª Has Charmed Awake
The Sleeping Mass â™ª

â™ª With No Regard
For Brooms Or Brass â™ª

â™ª The Cradle
Rocks The Equinox â™ª

â™ª Keys Are Owned
But Not The Locks â™ª

Do What?

Â™ª Oceans Boiled,
The Sea It Cooked â™ª

â™ª Armageddon
Came And Went â™ª

â™ª A Little Late
But Heaven Sent â™ª

What Do You Think?

Â™ª Is Mine Alone
So Let Me Be â™ª

â™ª Oh Yeah, Yeah â™ª

[Tru Screams]

â™ª There's No One Left,
It's Only Me â™ª

Aah! Aah!

[Class Laughs]

Hey, Are You Ok?

Oh...

Are You Guys Ready
For This?

The Only Condition Is That You
Have To Be Totally Honest.

I Want To Know Every Single Thing You Think.

Don't Worry.
Brutal Honesty Is Our Specialty.

Hey, Eddie.

Hi.

Tru: Welcome
To A Fantastic Journey

Inside The Brain
Of Eddie Walker...

Whoo!

Tru: The Brain
Is The Most Complex

And Mysterious Organ
In The Human Body.

It Controls All The Bodily Functions That Keep Us Alive.

But More Importantly,
It Defines Who We Are...

The Nervous System
Is Composed

One, Of A Series
Of Large Centers

Of Nerve Matter Called, Collectively,
The Cerebro-Spinal Centers.

2, Of Smaller Centers:
Ganglia.

3, Of Nerves Connected.
Either At The Cerebrum...

Of Certain Modifications
Of The Peripheral Terminations

Of The Nerves
Forming The Organs

Of The External Senses.

The Cerebro-Spinal Axis
Consists Of The Brain...

Which Are Contained Within The Skull And Spinal Canal.

The Brain
And Its Memories...

...Which Lines
The Interior Of The Skull.

Its Outer Surface
Is Rough And Fibrillated,

And Adheres Closely To The
Inner Surface Of The Bones,

Forming Their Internal
Periosteum.

This Adhesion Being Most
Marked Opposite The Sutures

And At The Base
Of The Skull.

...Sent Inward Into
The Cavity Of The Skull

Are 4 In Number...

Well, Folks,
There You Have It.

An In-Depth Journey
Into The Very Unique Mind

Of Eddie Walker.

I Hope It's
Been Enlightening.

For Wtuv,
This Is Trudy Walker.


So, What'd You Think?

What?

Uh, Well...

I Said I Wanted Honesty.

I Definitely
Learned A Lot.

And The Music
Was Good.

You Hated It.

No, It's Just, Uh...

What's The Word?

Boring?

Yeah.

You're Right.
It Stinks.

You Wanted
Truth, Right?

Yeah, Right.

But Maybe We're Not The Only
People You Should Be Asking.

I Mean,
It's A Medical Show.

Maybe You Need
A Second Opinion.

Good Job, Tru.

[Door Closes]

Boring?

Well...

It May Not Be
Everyone's Cup Of Tea.

A Cliche?
Thanks, Mom.

That's Exactly What
I Needed To Hear.

I Think The Problem Might Be That You Played It Safe.

I Want To Know Where
You Are In All This.

I'm Doing Most
Of The Filming.

That's Where I Am.

I Don't Mean Physically.
I Mean Emotionally.

What Are You
Talking About?

I Think It'd Be
Much More Interesting

From Your Point Of View.

Stop. I Get It.

You Hated It.
I'm A Total Failure.

Thank You.
Let's Just Drop It.

Help!

"Then, They Laid Down
In The Fluffy Hay

And Looked Up At
The Twinkling Stars."

Eddie: Those.

Yeah.
Isn't It Beautiful?

Yeah. Yep.

Tru, Do The Lamb Voice.
Do The Lamb Voice, Tru.

"Baa. How Nice
And Cozy Are We.

"Good Night, Cow.
Good Night, Lamb.

Baa. Moo."

Do It Again, Tru.
Do It From Here.

No.

Please?
Please, Tru?

I'm Too Tired, Eddie.

Eddie, You Didn't
Think My Show

Was That Awful,
Did You?

It Needs
More Car Crashes.


You're Right.

It's The Worst.

What If This Means
I Don't Have Any Talent?

I Mean, What If I Spent
All This Time Thinking

That I Was Born
To Have My Own Show,

And It Turns Out
I'm A Talentless,

Uncreative,
Boring Person?

You're Funny.


Glad You Think So.

Tru...

Are You Mad At Me?

No.

Of Course Not. Why?

'Cause, Um...

You Never Play
With Me Anymore.

Sorry, Eddie.

I've Been Really Busy
Working On My Tape.

Um, It Makes Me Sad.

How Come?

'Cause You Used
To Be My Twin...

Only Now, You're Not.

Tru: "Why Am I Such
A Loser, Deedee?

"I Want To Win
This Contest So Badly,

"But I Have No Idea
What Kind Of Show To Do.

"I Know My Mom
Tries To Help,

"But She Has This Way Of Making
Everything Sound Like Criticism.

"I Mean, If I Get
Too Personal,

Isn't Everyone Gonna See
The Show And Laugh At Me?"

Tru: I Don't Know.
Everything I Come Up With Is Weak.

Maybe I'll Get Lucky
And Get, Like,

Severely
Body Checked Today.

That Might Shake
A Good Idea Loose.

I'm Sure
You'll Do Fine.

Eddie: Come On, Tru!
Come On!

Have A Good Time, Kids.

We'll Be Over There
Cheering Our Heads Off.

Hi, Coach!

How's My Natural Wonder?

Ready To Rock 'N' Roll.

Good Boy.

You Gonna Remember
Not To Use

Your Hands Today,
Eddie?

I'll Try.

I Can't Ask For
More Than That.

Go To It.
Have Fun.

Come On.

[Indistinct Shouting]

Drive It In!
Drive It In!

Kick It! Oh!

It's Ok.

I Don't Know How
Any Of The Kids

Are Supposed
To Do Anything

With That Garret Galitski On Their Team.

He's Such A
Little Ball Hog.

You Want To Say That
A Little Bit Louder?

His Parents Are Sitting
Right Over There.

All Right, Garret.
Come On!

Whoops.


What?

Well, You Just Looked Exactly
Like Eddie When You Did That.

That Poor Guy.

Like He Doesn't
Have Enough Problems?

Baby...

Go! Go! Ok.

Pick Him Up!

That's Good.

Way To Go!

All Right, Tru!
Looking Good!

Tru: The Great Part About
Having Eddie On My Team

Is Once In A While,
We Get This--I Don't Know--

Like, Twin Telepathy
Thing Going On.

Sometimes, I Don't
Even Have To Look Up,

And I Automatically
Know He's Open.

Deedee: Dear Tru...

The Truth Is,
What You Feel

And The Things
You Deal With Every Day

Are Intense And Powerful.

That's What
Makes Them Interesting.

And I Agree It Is Risky
To Share Them.

But Maybe What You're Mom
Was Trying To Tell You

Is That Nobody
Has Ever Made Great Art

Without Taking A Risk.

And Just Remember.
If You Show Your True Self,

You Will Be Rewarded.


[Tru Laughs]

Isn't It Weird?
I Mean,

She Makes Me Feel
Totally Normal.

It's Like I Suddenly Have My
Own Personal Guardian Angel.

Did You Ever
Stop To Think

That Deedee
Could Be Some

500-Pound Guy
With Nasty B.O.

And A Tattoo On
His Hairy Back?

It's A Medical
Posting Site.

People Go There To Try
And Help Each Other.

Plus, She's
Totally Supportive.

She Thinks I'll Win
The Wtuv Contest.

And She Always
Encouraging Me

To Really Put
Myself Out There.

Oh, Hold On.

Hi, Tru. Hi.

Boom. Boom.

Tru! Tru!

Look, Look, Look, Look!
It's A Ducky!

I Don't Get It. Your Film's
About Eddie, Right?

Yeah, But It's Also
Kind Of About Me, Too.

You Sure You Want
To Do That?

Hello!

No.

Â™ª Am I The Only One â™ª

â™ª Who Gets To Make
You Laugh? Â™ª

â™ª Laugh Until You Cry? Â™ª

â™ª Am I The Only One â™ª

â™ª Who Asks You To Go... â™ª

[Both Shouting]

â™ª Go On Without Me? Â™ª

â™ª Am I The Only One â™ª

â™ª Who Loves
When You Leave... â™ª

Aah! Unbelievable!

Â™ª Your Hair Down In Front
Of Your Face? Â™ª

â™ª And Who â™ª

â™ª Who Do You Think I Am? Â™ª

Nice Catch, Retard.

Â™ª And Who â™ª

â™ª Who Do You Think
I'll Be? Â™ª

â™ª Without You? Â™ª

Mom, I Thought The Whole
Point Of Doing This

Was So That The Four
Of Us Could Be Together.

Look, Sweetie,
There Was An Emergency.

There's Always
An Emergency.

Sorry.

There's Only So Much Of This Life I Can Control.

I'm Ready To Go,
Ok, Mom?

Lookin' Good, Edward.

Get Up! Go!

Stupid Kite.
Stay Up. Come On.

Kite, Stay Up!

Come On!

Kite, Stay Up!

Eddie, Maybe There Just
Isn't Enough Wind.

No, Tru, It's Not
The Wind's Fault.

The Kite's Stupid.


Stupid Kite.

It Must Be Retarded.

Oh...

Oh... Oh, Tru...

[Thunder Crashes]

Eddie: Stay Up,
Stupid Kite...

Wow.

Stupid Kite, Stay Up.

Stupid Kite, Stay Up!

No, Tru, It's Not
The Wind's Fault.

The Kite's Stupid.
It Must Be Retarded.

I Can't Show This
To People.

They Won't Understand.

And What If They
Laugh At Eddie?

Ginny: Why Would They?

Aren't You Showing Them
How Much He Means To You?

Yeah. So?

I Think It's Gonna Be
Very Moving.

I Know, Mother.

You Have To Think That.

My Friend Deedee Says
I Shouldn't Be Afraid,

Even Though People Can
Be Really Cruel Sometimes.

While We're On
The Subject Of Deedee,

Can I Tell You
Something?

What, That Deedee Can Be
Some 800-Pound Guy?

I Know. That's
What Everybody's Saying.

But You Know,
She Gets Me, Mom.

She Understands.

If You Want My Opinion,
You Have To Send In Your Tape.

Remember, Dear,
If You Show Your True Self,

You Will Be Rewarded.

[Thunder Crashes]

Both: Oh, Powerful,
Loyal Rulers

Of Contest Entries,

Protectors Of The Deserving,

Servants Of The Talented--

Hocus-Pocus
Mumbo Jumbo.

Let's Just Get
This Puppy In The Mail.

Hey, I Need All
The Luck I Can Get.

I Can't Believe You're
Sending This Off

Without Showing Us First.

I Know,
But It's Too Late To Make Any More Changes.

Time To Let It Fly
And Be Free.

Well, It's Done.

Is Eddie Out Front?

Yes. He's Playing
Catch With Jake.

What's Done?

I Mailed My Tape.

Good For You.

Now, If You Show
Your True Self...

You Will Be Rewarded.

What?

Where Did You Come Up
With That?

With What?

The Saying.
The Phrase.

Oh.

Oh, Dear.

It's...

You're Deedee.

Tru, Let Me Explain, Ok?

You Can't!

Why Would You
Trick Me Like That?

To Make Me
Feel Stupid?

To Trap Me Into
Saying Something

So That You Could
Use It Against Me?

Whoa. Slow Down A Second.
Let Me Talk To You About This.

No! I Don't Want
To Talk To You.

I Don't Want
To Talk To You Ever!

I Hate You! I--

I Can't Believe That You Would Do This To Me!

[Door Slams]

So How Long Do You
Think She'll Go

Before She Speaks
To Me Again?

Well, I Don't Mean
To Make You Paranoid,

But The Guinness Records Guys Called This Morning.

They Want To Sign Her Up For
Their Parental Freeze-Out Category.

It's True. Oh...

Good Shot.
Right In The Heart.

Eddie?

Eddie?

Where Are You?

Eddie, Where Are You?

Eddie, Where Did You Go?

Another Ride.

Where'd You Get
That Hat?

Oh. Well--


What, Did Mom
Buy It For You?

No.

Did Dad?

Nope.

Oh, No.

You Didn't Steal It,
Did You?

No. No, No, No.

See, They Gave It
To Me. See 'Em?

Eddie, How Many Times
Have I Told You

Not To Take Stuff
From Strangers.

Come On.
Let's Go.

Tru, They
Gave It To Me.

Uh-Huh.

They Did.

No.

Ask 'Em.


What Is It?

You Like Billy Meyer.

So?

You Do!

I Know.

Excuse Me?

Excuse You Why?

Um...

Does This Belong
To You?

Uh, No.

I Told Him
He Could Keep It.

I Mean, Isn't This
"Be Kind To Retard" Week?

Besides, Why Would
We Want That Back

After All Three Of Us
Took Turns Spitting In It?

And Then You Gave It
To Him To Put On His Head?

What Is Wrong With You?

What's Wrong
With Me?

What's Wrong
With You, Freak?

I'm Beginning To Think
You're A Bigger Mental Case

Than He Is.

Aah!

Aah!

Hey! Hey!

Let's Go.

Hey! Come Back Here!

We're Leaving.

What's Wrong?

You Wouldn't Understand.

Â™ª It's Sad, But True â™ª

â™ª They Don't Know You
Like I Do â™ª

â™ª You're The Gold
At The End Of The Rainbow â™ª

â™ª And It Sparkles
While You Smile â™ª

â™ª You're The Light
In The Dark â™ª

â™ª They've Never Spent
Any Time In Your Heart â™ª

â™ª But I Have â™ª

â™ª So I Do â™ª

â™ª See The Beautiful â™ª

â™ª In â™ª

â™ª You â™ª

Hmm.

[Knock Knock]

Are You All Right?

I Don't Want
To Talk To You.

Ok.

I Need To Tell You
Something.

Well, I Don't
Want To Hear It.

Well, Then You Can
Just Listen.

I'm Sorry.

What I Did Was Wrong...

And I'm Really Sorry.

I Saw Your Posting
And I Just Dove In.

I Just Wanted
To Reach You.

Fine.

So We're Ok?

Everything's All Right?

They Spit
In His Hat, Mom,

And Then They Gave
It To Him To Wear!

What?

Yeah. No--

But
Everything's Fine.

Everything's Ok.

Hi. Wtuv?

Um, I Was Just Wondering
When You'd Be Announcing

The Winner Of The "Host
Your Own Tv Show" Contest?

No. Uh, Must
Be Somebody Else.

Ok.

Sorry. Thanks.

Oh, Oh, Oh,
I Can Not Believe They Recognized My Voice.

Big Surprise,

You Practically Call
Every 2 Seconds.

I Have No Idea What You're Talking About.

[Bell Clock Rings]

Tru,

I'm Done. Can
I Get Another One?

Sure. You Know Where
The Kids' Section Is.

Right There.

Ok.

Ok.






Tru?

Tru?

Tru?!

Tru!

Eddie: Tru!

Tru!

Tru!

Tru!

Tru!

Shh. This Is A Library.

Where's My Sister?

Calm Down.

No. I Have
To Find My Sister!

Wait!

Aah!

Ohh!


Eddie.

Eddie, It's Ok.

It's Ok. I'm Here.

Excuse Me.

This Is A Library.

Perhaps It Would Be Better
If You Took Him Outside.


Sure, Just Give Us
A Minute.

We'll Be
Really Quiet.

This Is Unbelievable.

She Said
They Need A Minute, Ok?

Just Chill.

Fine.

If You Need Any Help,
Let Me Know.

I'll, Uh,
Go Call Your Mom

And Let Her Know
We're Ready To Go.

Thanks.

It's Not Fair.

What Isn't Fair?

Um. I Want To Be Done
Being Different.

I Want To Be The Same
As Everybody Else.

Everybody's
Different, Eddie,

Not Just You.

No. No, Tru.

I'm Real Different.

You Know What?

You're Right.

You <I>Are Different.

But If You Were
Just The Same

As Everybody Else,

You Wouldn't Get All That Special Help In School,

You Wouldn't
Be Allowed

To Rollerblade
In The House...

And You Wouldn't Be
The Amazing Brother

That I Love.

You Mean It?

What's Wrong, Tru,
I Make You Sad Now?

What's Wrong, Tru?

Nothing.

Blow.


I Love You, Tru.

I Love You, Too, Eddie.

Tru: Right When Eddie
Was Melting Down,

I Was Mad That I Didn't Have My Video Camera.

Is That Awful?

You Know, Sweetie,

Don't Be So Hard
On Yourself.

You're Only A Mere
Mortal, After All.

Get Some Sleep, Ok?

Yeah.

Eddie: Hi, Mom.
We're Home!

Ginny: Hi.

Eddie: Hi.

Hang On. I'm Almost
Finished Here.

Tru, There's A Letter
For You By The Phone.

Oh, No. This Is It.

It's From The Tv Station.

Mom, Did She Win
The Contest?

I Don't Know.

I Did It. I Won.

She Won?

I Knew You Could Do It.

You Know, If Kids
Start Making Fun Of Me

For All The Personal Stuff
I Showed,

It's Totally
Gonna Be Your Fault.

Man: Good Afternoon,
Students.

This Is Principal Lawton
With A Brief Announcement.

As Many Of You Know,
One Of Our Students,

Ninth-Grader Trudy Walker
Has Won A Contest

Sponsored By Local
Cable Channel Wtuv.

Boy: Wow. All Right.

The Program She Created,<I>
A Day In The Life,

Will Be Airing Tomorrow
Evening At 8 p.m.

I Encourage All Of You
To Tune In,

And Congratulations, Trudy.

You Made Our School Proud.

Denise: Ohh, Man,
This Is So Exciting.

I Might Throw Up.

I Mean, I'm Serious.

I Might
Actually Throw Up.

Where Is Dad?

Did He Not Swear That He Would Be Here?

He Still Has A Few Minutes.
He'll Be Here.


Hey, Where's Eddie?

Here Comes
The Movie Star.

Ginny: Oh, Look At You.

All Dressed Up.

Over Here, Buddy,
In The V.I.P. Seats.

[Telephone Rings]

Hey, Guys.

Hello?

Hey, Where Are You?

Yeah.
She's Right Here.

Ginny: Daddy.

Tru: Hi, Dad.

Hey, Sweetheart.

Listen, I'm Running Late.

My Patient
Just Got Into Recovery.

I Have To Check On Him,

I Have To
Talk To His Family...

How Long?

Well, You're Gonna
Tape It For Me, Right?

We'll Watch It Together
Later, I Promise.

I Love You.

Love You, Too.

Knock 'Em Dead?

Ok. Bye.

We'll Tape It
For Him.

Already Ready To Go.

Denise: Guys, Guys,
It's Starting.

Ginny:
Oh, My Goodness.

Ok.

Anchor: Good Evening,
Ladies And Gentlemen,

And Welcome To A Very Special Wtuv Presentation.

And So,
Without Further Adieu,

Wtuv Proudly Presents<I>
A Day In The Life,

A Film By Trudy Walker.

Trudy: Meet My Twin Brother
Eddie Walker.

Good Morning, Tru.


[All Laugh]

Look At Me!

That's Me On Tv,
Huh, Mom, Like Gilligan?

Only 100 Times
More Handsome.

Ha Ha! Monkey Man
Attack! Aah!

Here You Go, Monkey Man!

Tru: Whoo Whoo Whoo
Whoo Whoo Whoo!

Ha Ha Ha Ha.

Eddie Is The Most Beautiful

And Profound Person I Know.

Eddie: Wow.

Wow. Look At That!

Ew. It's A Gross,
Disgusting Spiderweb.

No. Uh-Uh.

It's Perfect And
Beautiful And Strong.

Ginny: To The Side.

Tru: You Guys
Are Doing Great.

Certainly Are. Ok...

There I Am,

In All My Glory.

That's Ok.

Eddie: Oops. Sorry, Mom.

Everybody Makes Mistakes.

Yeah, E-E-E-Except God,
Though, Right, Mom?

'Cause If God
Makes Mistakes,

Then The Whole World Will
Look Like A Kid Drew It, Right?

Right?

If An Athlete
Gets Athlete's Foot,

What Does An Astronaut Get?

Give Up. What?

Missile Toe.

Ha Ha Ha Ha.

But Living With A Twin
Who Has A Mental Disability

Isn't Always
The Easiest Thing.

Eddie, Put My Camera Down.

Come Here. That's Mine.

Eddie: Hi, Tru!

Give It To Me Now.

Eddie, Put It Back, Eddie.

Let's Get
The Candy, Too, Ok?

Eddie, No.

Clerk: Will You
Hurry Up Here?

Let's Get The Candy.

Is This Gonna
Be Everything Or--

No. The Candy, Too.

No. We Are Done.
Thank You.

Tru, I Want
To Get The Candy!

No, Eddie, Come On.
Please.

Get The Candy, Tru!

Clerk: Hey, Hey, Hey,
Calm Down.

I Want To Get The Candy.

Eddie, Drop It.

Tru, Get The Candy!

Turn Off The Camera!

Let's Get The Candy, Tru!

Clerk: Give Him
The Candy!

Let's Get The Candy!

I've Got A Line.

When Eddie Acts Like This,

I Know What
Everybody's Thinking.

How Could
You Live With Him?

Eddie: Stay Up!

Stupid Kite, Stay Up!

Stay Up!

Please.

Stupid Kite, Stay Up!

Stupid.

Stupid.

Stupid! Kite's Stupid.

Stupid Kite.

It Must Be Retarded.

Tru: I Was Gonna Go See <I>Toy
Story 2 With Some Friends,

And Eddie Went--

I Mean, Combustible.

Kicking, Screaming,
Flinging Himself On The Floor...

And I Makes Me
Really Embarrassed

That He's My Brother.

It's All Right.

I Just Wish Other People
Would Take The Time

To Get To Know Him
The Way That I Do.

Eddie: Hey, Tru. Hey.
Want An Apple?

Hey, Are You Sure?

If--If You Want One, Tru,
Um, It's Right Here, Ok?

Right There.

If You Ever Think You Ought To Feel Sorry For Eddie...

Don't.

Because
He's Got More Joy

Than Almost
Any Other Kid I Know.

And Don't Feel Sorry
For Me, Either,

Because I've
Got A Brother

Who, Every Single Day,

Teaches Me What's
Important In Life.

Â™ª I've Been Waiting
The Longest Time â™ª

â™ª For This Moment
To Come Alive â™ª

â™ª Now I've Started To See â™ª

â™ª When You Look At Me â™ª

â™ª That In Your Eyes â™ª

â™ª I Find A Secret World â™ª

â™ª In Your Eyes... â™ª

Hi!

Â™ª There Lies
A Secret World â™ª

â™ª And Everything
Feels Right â™ª

â™ª When We're Safe Inside

â™ª Of Our Secret World â™ª

Wow.

That Was Great.

You're Gonna Be A Star.

Big Humongous Star, Tru.

Pretty Impressive.

Yeah.

Where Are You?

You Noticed, Huh?

Oh, Yeah.

Hazards Of
The Medical Life.

Mmm.

We All Become
Invisible Fathers.

Yeah. Some Of Us
More Than Others.

Wow. I Don't Believe It.

I Mean,
You Were So Out There.

Wasn't It Scary To Do?

Yeah.
I Wonder What All The Other Kids Are Gonna Think.

Who Knows?

Her Opinions Were Dumb,

All The Images
Were ClichÃ©s,

And Her Wardrobe Was,
Like, Completely The Worst.

If I Were Tru,

I'd Drop Out Of School
And Move To Siberia.

It Would Have Been
Much More Effective

If She'd Done The Entire
Program In Spanish.

Of Course,
She Could Never Stay Awake

Long Enough In My Class
To Learn.

A Whole 1/2 Hour
Of The Retard Twins?

Pass-Adena.

[Bell Rings]

I Saw Your Show, Tru.

It Was Fantastic.

Thanks.

Hey, Tru. Nice Job.
Really Impressive.

Wow. Thanks.

My Mom Cried
Through The Whole Thing.

Hey, Tru. Hey.


Hi, Dad.

Hey, Tru.

Hey, Tru, Come In Here
A Second, Willya?

I Want To Talk To You.

Ok, I Watched
Your Show Again.

But If People Were Only Paying Casual Attention,

I'm Not Sure They'd Even
Know You Have A Dad.

Sorry. I Tried
To Put You In More.

But...

Come On. What Happened?
Tell Me. I Can Handle It.

It's...

If I'd Used All
The Stuff I'd Shot,

I Know You Would
Have Been Really Mad.

Oh, Come On.

Well, I Think You Have
To Show Me, Then.

You Know, We Really
Don't Have To Do This.

Why? What Are
You Afraid Of?

Hurting Your Feelings.

Ha Ha Ha.

What'd You Do,
Draw Devil Horns On Me Or Something?

Come On.

Let's Let The Footage
Speak For Itself.


[Beep Beep]

Bob: That Was Something
I Really Liked.

Aah! Unbelievable!

We Can't Even
Get Through A Meal!

Sorry.

Ok. I Lost My Temper.

That Happens.
What Am I, Perfect?

Come On. What Else?


Eddie: Dad! Dad, Monkey Man!

He's Gonna Get Me, Dad!

Come On,
Come On, Come On!

Does It Look
Like I'm Working?

Dad!

I'm Working Here!

What Do I Have To Do To Make It Clear To You?

Come On--Out!

Let's Go. Out. Out.

Sorry.

What Are You Do--
Are You Filming This?

Turn The Camera Off.

Hi. It's Dr. Walker.
You Paged Me?

Eddie! Stop It!

Can't You See
I'm On The Phone?!

I'm Working Now!

Can I Just Get
5 Minutes To Myself?

Oh, For--Eddie,
What Is This Mess?!

Eddie, Pick Up
Your Clothes.

How Many Times
Have I Told You

Not To Throw Your
Clothes On The Floor?

It's All Like This?

Pretty Much.

Or Else
You Weren't There.



Dad, Your Job
Is Really Hard.

You're Under
A Lot Of Stress.

Eddie And I
Know That.

We Totally Get It.

That's No Excuse.

You Deserve
Better Than This.

Ohh. What Do I Do Now?

Honey, I Had No Idea.

I Mean, Who <I>Is That Guy?

Dad...

Eddie Loves Us
No Matter What--

Even When
We Make Mistakes.

You And Me And Mom,

We're His
Entire World.

He Just... Loves Us.

Maybe All We Have To
Do Is Love Him Back.

All Right.

One Click,

It's All In
The Recycle Bin.

Naw. Save It.

You Might Need It
To Keep Me In Line.

[Beep Beep]

Note To Self: When I Do Make
A Tv Show Out Of My Life,

Remind Me To Cast
Somebody Else As My Mom.

You Know, You Never
Had To Be Deedee.

All You Had To Do
Was Talk To Me.

You Make It Sound
So Easy.

You Know, It Wasn't
That Long Ago

You Used To Tell Me
Everything.

Sometimes More Than
I Wanted To Hear.

Just Because
I Don't Tell You

Every Intimate
Detail Of My Life,

It Doesn't Mean That
I Don't Love You.

I Never Thought
You Didn't Love Me.

I Just Missed You.

When I Was Making
My Movie...

Watching It Over
And Over Again,

It Really Hit Me.

You Know How
For So Long,

Eddie And I Weren't Ever Really The Same,

But, You Know,
We Played Monkey Man

And We Went Out
For Soccer Together

And We
Goofed Around.

You Grew Up Together.

Only Now,
I'll Go To College

And Probably
Get Married

And Have Kids...

And Eddie'll
Always...

Stay Eddie.

Oh, My Girl.


Tru: So My Life
Isn't A Tv Show.

I'll Survive.

I Mean,
Just Because In Real Life,

Things Don't Get
Wrapped Up Nice And Tidy,

It Doesn't Mean
They Can't Improve.

Dad Is Making An Effort
To Be Around More.

And He's Trying
Really Hard To Relax.

Don't Let It Go.
Don't, Don't Don't!

I Said Trying.

I Mean,
To Quote A Mom ClichÃ©,

"Rome Wasn't Built
In A Day."

And Mom Has Promised
To Be More Available,

So We Can Talk And Stuff.

And, Yes, I Promise
To Actually Listen

And Be Open With Her.

And Eddie... Well, I Think
It's Safe To Say

That Eddie Will Always Be
Eddie.

Come On, Mom.

I Can't.

Eddie: Play
With Me, Mom.

No, I--

I'll Play With You,
Eddie.

Eddie: Ok, Tru.
We're Gonna Play Tag.

Tru: Go Eddie!

[All Cheer]

Eddie, Come On,

We've Watched The Scene,
Like, 10 Times.

Let's Move On.

It's Not Like
It's Gonna Change.

I--I Like It.

I Don't Want It
To Change.

It's You And Me...

Being Twins.
