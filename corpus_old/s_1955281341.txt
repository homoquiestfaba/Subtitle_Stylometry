Sir. I'd like to be point

I told you, Dassault is going to get you killed. 
We don't have a choice, Jason.

They started again, a new program,

What's that got to do with me? 
Because it matters.  It matters.

To me, it doesn't.

All that matters is staying alive. 
You get off the grid, survive.

I don't believe that,
and neither do you.

Look at yourself.

Look at what you're doing.

You can't live like

Jason, I came here

I found you father's

He was an analyst.
He wasn't in operations.

He wasn't near any of that stuff. 
I'm telling you what I saw.

It looks like he was involved directly.

And there's more. More about you. 
What do you mean?

Before you joined the program, 
they were watching you.

Watching me?

You tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

And you don't know the truth

You need to read those files.

We don't even know

This is Director Dewey, 27 is gone.

Hold on, Nicky.

I'm going to get you to cover.

Don't, no ..

I'm coming..

Location was from this office, sir.

If he was working with Nikky Parsons, 
he will have suggested Bourne.

And let me know if you
get a hit on that malware.

Sir, can I clarify one thing.

34:20.040  [??? ]

Plus he has to think Bourne.

34:22.280 [ ???]

His behavior or will-power?

And suggests a connectioin.

The last time Bourne came back he 
exposed the Black Briar program.

He compromised accurate operations.

And the assets in Syria, under cover.

He was captured, and tortured. And
took near a damn year to get him out.

So you think that's why Bourne 
wanted the files. To go public again?

I have no idea why he came back.

But whatever he's doing, 
he wants to destroy us.

I can't let that happen.

So please give me a call, 
soon as you hear anything.

Yes, sir.

And now the founder and chairman 
of DEEP DREAM .. Aaron Kalloor.

Ahh, you know why you're here. 
We will be unveiling a new platform.

We think it is a bold new step, to
allow us to serve our community better.

We're turning in right now to 
trascend national boundaries, and

I think we're at 1.5 Billion users.

You know we have an ecosystem of hundreds 
of thousands of apps at this point.

And what this new platform
will do is integrate

User's data and preferences,

And use that information, 
to enrich and tailor-make

Each unique user experience, 
in a way that is frankly

Unprecedented.

Now, I can see some journalists' brains 
twitching, ready to ask about privacy.

This is a concern of many
people, and so it should be.

This is something that matters 
to us, and let me just say

I understand, nobody wants to feel 
like they're being watched

So let just tell you, when you come to 
DEEP DREAM, when you use our service.

No-one will be watching you.

Enjoy your meal? 
Thank you.

Congratulations,

I hear you stock-holders were very 
happy with the new platform.

And I heard you got hacked.

You were [ ???].

This changes everything. 
There's too much risk.

I'm out. 
Hey,

You are an extra-ordinarily gifted 
and perceptive young man.

And you agreed to help us it's because 
you understood the very grave threats,

Do you have idea the shit-storm on our 
hands if this arrangement goes public?

I agreed to it, and you were more ..

Our enemies have become 
much more sophisticated.

Gathering meta-data is
no longer adequate.

We need a back-door into
your new platform, in a way

40:28.680 [ ???]. 
When that's not enough, you want something new.

You .. you don't get it, do you?

Privacy is,, is, freedom.

I believe that's something you 
should think about defending.

You little prick, you didn't believe 
in privacy or freedom when

When you started. 
I've turned you into a billionaire.

I have paid you back many,
many, many times over.

And I was not comfortable
with any of this.  I'm out.

I'm done selling out our customers. 
Yet you would sell out your country.

The truth is, we would't be having 
this conversation if you didn't feel

Personally at risk.

You talk about a free internet, you tell 
yourself you're saving the world,

All you're doing is making it a much more 
dangerous place. And you sure as hell

Making this country much
more difficult to defend.

And you're sure as
hell accountable for that.

Bring him back in, is the smart move.

And how are we going to do that?

So, you think if we give him

I'm just saying that
maybe we should listen.

Why?

Jesus, just because of you.

he wasn't in operations.

He didn't really choose you, 
but when he found out

He threatened to expose the program.

He didn't want you turned into a killer.

Who killed him?

Don't do it.

Where is he?

He's almost there.

We're going to stop this now.

He went off the roof.
Tried to run. [???].

He recognized me.

I got to make sure it's finished. [???].

Step aside please, step aside.

He's gone. - Oh, shit. 
I'm going after him.

I'll work my way down the Canal.

No. You're done in London.

What're you talking about? 
There's another place [???].

Now he knows [???].

that you didn't have [???].

Or Bourne, [???].

I'll deal with him, do you understand?

Of course. 
I agree completely.

When you're on stage, [???].

I'll be ready, sir. 
Okay, let's do this.

Aaron. 
Robert.

You never met.

Yeah, we.. we went to Stanford together.

How are you enjoying life at the Agency? 
Challenging, but fulfilling.

[???], still your interest over there?

My principles are just fine, thanks.

Gentlemen, we're ready for you. 
Follow me, please.

I'm going to enjoy this. 
So am I.

Oh, hi. How's everyone doing tonight?

Welcome.

Welcome to tonight's EXOCON Symposium.

We are so lucky to have four 
fantastic guests this evening.

CIA Director, Robert Dewey

Dear friend of mine,
and old friend of EXOCON,

CEO social media giant DEEP 
DREAM, Aaron Kalloor is here.

[???], Personal rights vs Public safety.

This is the great question of our time.

And the choices we make about 
this will determine our future.

So let's just dive right in, okay?

Come on, you guys!

Sir, you have an incoming message.

High priority.

Alright guys, I'm going 
to have to take this.

1:26:45.34 [???].

It appears Director Dewey settled 
down momentarily, and I mean

I'm told that it shouldn't
be too much longer,

But we have a ton of stuff to get into 
tonight, so I'm going to start anyway.

Craig, can I say a few words?

Excuse me? 
Can I get normal?

Oh, sure man. By all means. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.

Thank you, thanks a lot.

Before the Director comes 
 out to join us, I just

just wanted to share a
few words with you guys.

A long time ago, I,
I had this idea.

Copy that.

Facial recognition got a hit on [???]

He was [???] in Vegas like two hours ago.

1:28:02.39  [???]

Someone issued an Agency 
security clearance on his passport.

... people from aroun the world 
 started using our service,

<font color="#ff8080">SOMETHING's WRONG</font>

Come on stay, take care of
Kalloor, and the girl.

Copy.

What I want to say is, you know,

All this success has come at a cost,

There's a cancer at the heart

of DEEP DREAM,

A guilty secret,

and now, ah, now I have to share it

with all of you guys, so

Just have to take a [???]. Take  
out Kalloor and the girl right now.

I, took money to ah, start my company

and made a bargain with
the guy in the dark suit.

And now, he's come back to take my soul.

Sir, we got to go.

Get the cars ready.  
Get the cars ready, right now!

No. Take me to the suite.

Sir, we got to get you out of
here. Bourne is on the loose.

You heard me. 
Take me to the suite. - Yes, sir.

Take to the suite. Take him upstairs.

Get him upstairs. Right now, right now.

Up to the suite.

Vasquez, sitrep. [SITUATION REPORT]. 
Vasquez.  Vasquez, come in.

Hey!

Okay, we got him, sir.  
We've ID'd the sniper.

Shit! 
We're circulating his photo now.

What about Bourne? 
Hang on.

Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west 
stairs corridor heading for the lobby.

Copy that.  Stay on Bourne.

Horton. 
We're still looking for Bourne. 
 They've ID'd the IAD asset.

Go back to the first floor, and wait for 
further instructions.- Yes, sir, copy that.

Stop right there. 
Put it down.

Move, move, move.

[???] to the northeast elevator, now.

Bourne is on his way up to you.

You took a long time to get here, Jason.

I know about Beirut.

I know what you did.

It all ends tonight.

It'll a lot easier if do it right away.

You didn't come here for revenge. 
You came because it's time to come in.

Your father created the program. Didn't 
have what it takes to make it work.

And you did.

You always did.

That's why you volunteered. - I volunteered 
because I thought terrorists killed Lou.

I volunteered because of a lie. 
No. You volunteered becasue of who you are.

You volunteered because 
you are Jason Bourne.

And, not, David Webb.

32 kills, Jason.

[???] 
people all across this country,

Are safer because of what you did.

1:34:53.80  [???].

I tried to find another way.

And how's that working out for you?

You didn't any peace.

NOt till you admit to
yourself, who you really are.

It's sudden death here, Jason.

Stop doing it.

So? 
I can't.

Not for you.

You were never here.

You don't have to walk.

This can stop now.

You have a choice.

[???] All units, suspect stole 
 a 2015 black dodge charger.

This is Air One, be advised, 
suspects vehicles have crashed

On the southeast entrance of the Riviera.

We have unkown a suspect heading 
to the storm-drain of the Riviera.

You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

1:45:50.64 [???].

[???] work with the authorities, 
to find out who's responsible.

1:47:35.92 [???] .

Thank you.

Sir.

I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

About Vegas.

I read that Dewey's tactics
were .. unwise.

Unwise.

We're still trying to come up with a 
narrative to explain what happened.

That son-of-a-bitch put 
a spotlight on our heads.

All of us.

1:48:44.79 yet [???].

I know her. [???]

There's still moves we can make.

Tell me.

Dewey's problem was that 
he clung on to the past.

People are  [???]  the future.

These are my people.

I know what to do over.

and what do you want?

When you appoint someone head of your 
Agency, you're going to need someone,

Working [???].

Someone ...

An hour, [???].

By you, [???]

1:49:28.05- [???].

What about Bourne?

You still think you can bring him in?

I have his trust.

After all we've been through.

I'll bring him in.

I'm certain of it.

What if you can't?

Then ..

He'll have to be put down.

That's an interesting proposal.

You can pull over here.

Of course if you decide
you don't need me,

That's not a problem.

There are many other agencies 
that want what I know.

I brought you something.

It's a cast from you father's
star, on Memorial Wall.

I'm sorry for what happened to you.

I [???]. The people who did that, are gone.

And,

Things are changing in the Agency.

What is it you want?

I know you've always been a patriot.

And what happens to this 
country, matters to you.

We need you to help us protect it.

Come back in.

And we'll work together.

Let me think about it.

How will I find you.

You still think you can bring him in?

I have his trust.

After all we've been through.

I'll bring him in.

I'm certain of it.

And if you can't?

Then,

He'll have to be put down.
