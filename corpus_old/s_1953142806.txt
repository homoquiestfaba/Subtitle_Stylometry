<i>Late Autumn</i>

<i>7 Years Later</i>

Mom died.

Brother's will bail you out,
so you can come.

Will you come?

All right.

Excuse me.

Yes.

Yes.

Where are you?

On the way to Seattle.

What is it?

Want your money from Mrs. Cha?

Her husband looking for me.

If he gets her, she's dead.

Why?

The lady took his money.

You know her husband?

It's no a joke,
he is totally insane

He's looking for you.

Really?

Be careful,
lay low for a bit.

All right.

Well, it's called.

What's up?

Don't you know? 
You owe money!

Better cover for less.

Forget it.

How so?

Enough already.

There everywhere!

If you hide, how will I work?

Oh, my head.

We can run all over the U.S.,
but they will find us.

I'll be fine!

I've lived in the 
States for two years.

Don't worry about me!

I already speak English well.

You'll find new customers.

Wait a minute.

You came!

Anna!

Hello!

Anna, sit!

We thought you 
would come tomorrow.

They were starting 
to get impatient.

You must be tired
 from the trip.

Drink your tea.

Thanks to our brother
you could come.

Murderers getting a 
pardon is more difficult.

Alex!

Thank you, brother.

Don't thank me.

Come on, drink, drink.

Drink it.

That is lost

They want to say hi.

You haven't met before, right?

Hi there.

Grandma, come with us.

I'll go with the children.

And I'll answer that.

And I forgot to turn
 off the stove!

You talk to her.

I'll see whats happening there.

Alex.

What is it?

I want to tell you something.

After Mom died,
the house was empty.

We decided to sell it.
We needed the money.

Naturally we'll
divide the money equally.

And you will have a cut.

You only have to sign here.

Would you like more tea?

Eat your cookies.

What happened to the tombstone?

What happened?

Will you correct it?

Well said
that can't be right.

How can it?

Can't fix it.

And what do we do?

Already labeled.

You should correct it!

Tell me how do I?

This is important
ask Anna.

What can she say

fresh out of jail?

I had to take care!

I think you have to ask.

If you insist!

Anna, listen.

Because of your brother the tombstone
has the wrong birthdate.

He said he will arrange everything.

Anna's not my fault,
if they engraved it wrong.

It was your fault!

No matter who is guilty
it should be corrected.

The funeral is tomorrow
what do you suggest?

-You can put it with the wrong date.
I'm not guilty ...

-You should be careful ...
I was busy selling the house.

Which is more important
 the funeral or mom's house?

Should I cry about it?

How are you?

It's not easy to coming back, right?

I thought you would come.

You haven't changed.

Wrong.

I've changed.

You still look like a child.

Do you remember loving
this child?

What?

Time flies by.

Many things have happened to me.

Only for me it's always the same.

That day I went back.

-But ...
It's in the past.

Hey, Wang Jing!

Coming, coming.

Expensive.

Leaving.

I'm leaving the money 
on the table.

Dear!

Don't hurry to leave.

You can stay behind.

The weather is terrible.

I'm leaving.

What did you say?

Honey.

Honey, what did you say?

Everything is fine.

Thank you 
don't worry.

Ah, yes.

I can.

I'm Hung.

All right.

Good.

Good, good.

He was a friend of my brother.

We grew up together.

All right.

And I was so in love
I was ready to die for him.

Bad.

One day he just left me.

Good.

I married someone else.

From the start

my husband beat me.

Bad.

I realized that I was jealous.

I was weak and doubted myself.

Then he stopped.

Good.

One day

my ex-boyfriend came back

and asked me to go with him.

Good.

I do not know how
but my husband knew about it.

He was so angry and threatened to kill me.

Bad.

That morning ...

I don't remember what happened ...

Good.

Why is everything so wrong?

Good, good.

Bad.

Where are you?

You came?

Quickly

Theres as much as you want.

Your husband wanted me.

I Know.

Don't worry.

You just look terrible,

but you look good.

Your husband wants to kill me.

Want to stop seeing me?

Everything will be alright.

I'll give you money
to open a restaurant.

Let's run away!

I'm leaving.

Wait a minute.

We'll meet again.

I know.

Go on.

Go.

Quickly.

Here you go.

With me you were taken care of.

So silly.

Silly.

Mom, remember this?

Taught me when I was little.

But yours were better.

What do you think?

Not bad, eh?

Mom...

Oh, yeah ...

Mom ... look.

Here it is.

See?

You see without glasses?

Here it is.

Now I live there.

The weather there is very nice.

Don't worry about me.

Sorry, but I don't remember you.

He is my friend.

Thank you.

All right. That was it.

Thank you.

Don't worry about the money.

Brother,

Come here for a second.

I'll be over there.

Once mom is gone,

you must understand the restaurant.

Half of it is yours.

We'll talk later.

When then?

When will you decide
what do you want?

Wang Jing, come!

Wang Jing!

Anna, come here.

What's up?

What's up?

Sorry, sorry.

How are you?

It's nothing. Really.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Everything is fine.

Excuse me, excuse me.

Why did you use his fork?

Can you tell me?

Why use a fork,
since it is not yours!

It was his! Not yours!

Where is Mrs. Cha?
