[gentle music]

[sheep bays]

[bear grunts]

[ominous music]

[sheep baying in distress]

[happy music begins]

[prop plane approaches]

Bet you've never
seen this much land

without people or freeways...

Or smog.

Where are the buildings?

Tell you what,

let's get a
closer look.

Beautiful isn't it?

How much farther?

Look ahead.

Are we that to land in that
little lake?

Well we'll give it shot,
I've never done this before,

it's my first time.


I'm just kidding.

Who's that?

That's Pete.

Who is he?

Pete's a ranger,
works with me.

Welcome to Heartbreak Bay.

Yeah.

I'm Peter.

Hi Pete.

Step on down there.

Whoa, buddy.

There's plenty of time for a
swim later.

Yeah. Thanks.

Uh, I never thought I'd see
the day,

your Dad got this bag
from our Dad

the day he took off for college.

He called it his lucky bag.

Mom tried to throw it away but
Dad said I should have it.

Your Dad has always had a way
of getting whatever he wants.

Come on.

Watch your step.

So Pete where's the town?

It's through the trees.

Through the trees, right.

So what do you think?

It's, uh,

it's rustic.

I like it.

[LAUGH]
Rustic.

Any place to board?

Well you could probably get a

few good runs on Main Street.

Yeah it's got a couple of
hundred potholes

but there's not a lot of traffic

so you got that going for you.

Your room is over here.

Check it out.

I don't know a whole lot about
decorating

so my friend Dakota

helped me fix it up
a little bit.

Cool.

Okay,

get settled in.

He likes it.

Cool.

All right now I'm very
well-known around these parts

for my gourmet trout.

Dig in.

Uh, I think I'm going
to be sick.

What's the matter?

It's looking at me.

Oh come on I just caught this
bad boy, Mark.

This is bigger than you and me,

this is about man's triumphant
return from the hunt,

you gotta eat that.

All right look,
how about you just taste this

little bit right
here inside the cheek,

that's the best
part right there.

Just a tad?

All right fine, you know what,

I'll eat it.

I'm sure I've got some

leftover meatloaf.

I'll make you a sandwich.

Could have been anything

but must have been a
pretty big animal

to carry off a full grown sheep.

I heard a bear has been seen
around the old main road.

Looks like we got us
a bear problem.

Jack Wedloe is the
one for that job Fog.

We'll see.

Have one of the boys keep an eye
on them sheep.

Let's go.

Hey Jack how's your grandma
doing today?

This is Dakota's.

Hey Dakota, this is my nephew
Mark,

Mark this is Dakota.

Is that your real name?

That's what they call me.

Just Dakota, nothing else?

Well if I told you

then these two busy bodies

listening behind me would know.

It's really nice to meet you
Mark.

Hey Dakota how about a slice
of meatloaf?

Why don't you grab a basket?

She's pretty nice, huh?

Yeah.

Is she your girlfriend?

What'd make you say that?

Well she helped you guys fix
up my room.

And she cooks dinner for you
guys sometimes.

Yeah sometimes.

All right look,

I'll admit I think
she's pretty cool

but she's not my girlfriend.

Why not?

You know, I mean, she's pretty

and she seems nice.

Yeah well things aren't that
simple,

if you know what I mean.

I was expecting

a little better turnout
too, are you boys
doing something outside

you're not telling
old Fog huh?

All right boys I got a little
problem here

and you're just the type of guys
who can help me get rid of it.

That's just fine with me.

Make sure those dogs are all
tied up nice and tight.

You all know the score, right?

Now before you
get crazy out there

I want to make
one thing real clear.

Collars is fine okay?

You worry too much.

This is not open season on
anything and everything that
crawls out there,

we are looking for one big mean

black bear that's
been attacking my sheep.

Now for obvious reasons if
there's any dialogue

it is between you and me, you
and me.

We don't talk to
our friendly ranger.

All you have
here is junk food.

How do you manage not to starve?

We survive on the charity of
others,

like yourself.

Uh huh charity is right.

Has he tried to make you eat

some of his famous trout?

I had the meatloaf.

My trout is awesome.

Pete tell them how
good my trout is?


Ranger, Fog Benson is out here

he's talking
about killing bears.

He can't, oh here he comes now,

you can't let him do this.

Wedloe, we have to talk.

Okay.

There's a bear out there

he's dragging my sheep off,

it's your job to do something
about it.

I'll check into it right away.

If you don't I will.
Really?

If you boys are going to get
into a shouting match

do you think you could take it
outside?

Could you put this on my tab,
please?

Thank you.

If you have business with my
office,

I'll be back there shortly.

Mark.

All right I got a bear
problem,

I'm willing to pay to make it go
away.

Jack's not going to like you
telling folks that, Fog.

What the ranger likes or don't
like really isn't much of a
concern to me, Dakota,

I got a right to protect my
sheep.

They come all the way from
Australia

and they're a heck of a lot more
expensive than a bear hide.

So 500 bucks Zeke, Maynard, get
me that bear.

Think about what you boys could
do with 500 bucks, huh?

Spread the word.

Uh, excuse me Mr. Fog, uh,

bears are a protected species.

You should let the ranger take
care of it.

I don't need some, uh,

eco hippy from down South
telling me what to do.

I'm just saying that a hot
temper

and a loaded gun are not a great
combination.

Yeah.

Stick to your tree hugging.

It's Jack's job to deal with
animal problems.

And it's my job to protect my
stock.

Well you don't have to run
roughshod over people in the
process.

Unfortunately there are people
out there like Fog

who believe that they can shoot
or trap whatever they want,

whenever they want

and we're responsible for over
1,000 square miles of prime
wilderness.

Pete, he was born here,

he knows this land better than
anybody.

Yeah there's 300 humans
scattered throughout,

870 elk,

78 moose,

maybe 100 wolves,

a couple hundred deer,

and 52 bears,

mostly black and a few
grizzlies.

Where do the bears live?

Everywhere, and anywhere.

The biggest ones are
in Grizzly Valley.

Why do they call it that?

Oh, that's a natural bear
habitat

and it's uninhabited by humans

except for poachers.

Poachers?

Yeah I suspect we got a couple
running around.

Too young bears are missing.

How do you know they're
missing?

They had radio collars,

we lost the signal.

Uh, I'd like to believe they
just moved out of the territory.

You see, Mark,
this is still some very wild
country.

So if you go hiking or exploring
the trails you have to be very,
very careful.

You need to respect the land and
the animals that live on it.

Because even though they may not
mean to, it could hurt you.

Get it?
Got it.

Good.

Give me back my hat.

Come on guys,
let's have some fun.

Hey kid, let me use your board.

What are you deaf or something,

I said give me your
board and your helmet.

Now.

Leave him alone, Gunther.

What's it to you, Benson?

Get lost.

Come on guys, let's get out of
here.

He even needs a girl
to protect him.

Hi, I'm Ashley Benson.

You must be Mark.

How do you know?

Dakota has been
talking about you

for weeks now.

I couldn't wait for you
to get here

so she'd talk
about something else.

Why would she
be talking about me?

She's only, like,

completely in love
with your uncle.

I saw the way she looked at my
Uncle Jack.

Watch out.

It's just Harvey.

He's tamer than a lap cat.

Shoo Harvey, get, shoo.

Right.

Jack?

You got an important phone call.

It's the State Department.

Los Angeles?

It's okay.

Come on Los Angeles has got to
be a lot better than okay.

-[Fog] Ashley June.

You finished with your chores?

I borrowed a book from Dakota.

Are you done with your chores?

No sir.

You're Jack Wedloe's nephew
aren't you?

Yes sir.

Get in the car Ashley June,

you can play afterward.

But Dad.

No butts, get in the car.

Sorry Mark.

Welcome to town, son.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on
there.

It's best to stay away from
other people dogs, okay.

They're real protective
of our stuff.

Hey Mark.

Hi.

Who are those two
guys with the dogs?

Oh they're just some
conservationists doing studies.

You here to see me?

Actually I was going to have a

milkshake with your friend
Ashley

but her Dad didn't seem to like
the idea.

Well I guess you're
going to have to settle

on having that
milkshake with me.

Cool.

So, um, when are you and my
uncle going to hook up?

What?
Well it's not like the whole

town doesn't know that

you and he totally like
each other.

And Ashley said...

Ashley

should know better than
to spread gossip.

And you have an ice cream
mustache and should go wash up.

Jack?

I just got a call from the
State Department,

Mark's parents are missing in
Indonesia,

they never came back from a
visit to the Rain Forest.

Oh Jack.

Whew.

Hey.

What's up?

Hi.

Hi.

I, uh, made Mark a hamburger
and some chicken fingers.

I thought you two may be hungry.

Thanks.

How's Mark doing?

Well, as soon as we got home

he locked himself in his room,

hasn't come out since.

Is this a picture of you and
Mark's Dad?

Yeah,

10 years ago.

[LAUGH]

You want to talk about it?

It's weird,

Ben was always the
perfect one.

High school valedictorian, now a
famous doctor.

I wish this hadn't happened to
him.

What happens to Mark?

Grandma May is 85 years old, she
can't handle a kid.

He's got nowhere else to go.

I mean, it's one thing to be a
cool uncle

for a couple weeks but a
full-time Dad.

I got to be honest, Dakota,

I don't know if I'm

ready to be a father,

probably screw it up.

No.

You know, I once made one skip
15 times.

You know, my people believe
that, uh,

all animals have spirits and
souls

and talk to us

in ways we
sometimes don't understand.

She's leading you.

Go ahead, follow.

Go on.

Go on

follow her.

You like animals boy?

Sure.

Me too.

That's Harvey there.

We've met already.

And this is Andy.

That's Arnold

and over there is Max.

You got names for all of them?

Well they all have their own
names,

except I don't even know what
they call themselves,

so I just give them
names that I know.

What do they call you?

Mark Wedloe.

Mark Wedloe.

Name's Cully.

Want to help me feed these guys
Mark Wedloe?

I should go.

Come on.

It'll only take 10 minutes.

See as long as
animals have food,

they don't fight.

It's not like humans.

What about bears?

Well bears are different,

bears are kind of a solitary
animal.

They spend most of their lives
by themselves.

They don't learn to trust much,

especially people.

Why should they when there's

poachers and people like Fog
hunting them?

You catch on quick, Wedloe.

Yeah I had me a bear once,

big black beautiful bear.

Got him when he was a cub,

that's why we got along so well.

What happened to him?

Well the folks in town,

they got kind of nervous

forcing me to make a decision.

I took him put to a place that,
uh,

well no one from around here
goes there much.

A special little place called
Three Sisters.

Three peaks that look alike,

it's called Grizzly Valley.

What happened to him?

Well I kind of like to think
that

he's still alive chewing on some
berries

and maybe some fish,

making himself fat for winter.

Well, I guess we're just about
done here,

I guess you got to go?

Yeah sure.

Mark Wedloe,

you come back here
any time you want.

Family we got to see.

We took the rest of them up to
higher pasture.

You find anything?

There's nothing.

You guys stomped all over any
tracks

that might have been left here.

You can't be
sure of anything now.

You know, bears seldom come
this close to livestock.

Hey. I thought I could go
hiking.

I'm staying by the phone in
case they call about my folks.

Sitting here worrying isn't
going to do you any good.

Come on keep me company.

You never can tell when I might
need to be rescued

from some fearsome wolf dog.

We can stay on this trail
until Wolverine Ridge,

from there we can see
the whole valley.

You know, uh . . .
Break.

So, have you always
lived in the city?

Yeah.

Do you like it?

Yeah.

Dakota tells me that your
parents are doctors

that fly around the world and
help people.

They're part of a group
called, uh,

Doctors Without Borders.

Every year they go to some
remote area and help people.

Wow,

they must be very special
people to do that for others.

Yeah, they are.

When we going back?

Hey, want to go see a real
gold mine?

We're not suppose to go but I've
been there once.

Where is it?

Over this way, come on.

Let's go into the mine.

No way, it's too dangerous.

All these old mines are ready to
collapse.

Come one maybe there's still
some gold.

I think not.


What was that?

Uh, wind?


That was not the wind.

Mark.

What is it?


You got to come see this,

it's way cool.


Oh my god!

It's a bear.

He's trapped.

It's an old mine dig Mark.

Come on we need to go back to
town right now

and tell your uncle.

Yeah, right.

And your Dad will come out and
shoot him.

What else can we do?

What are you doing?

He's hungry.

Well, at least he won't be
hungry.

We ought to get back,

there's a storm front coming in.

What about him?

He's a bear, Mark,

he'll find a way out.

Mark, come on.

Sorry buddy.


What do bears eat?

What?

Bears,

what do they eat?

Uh, pretty much everything.

Berries, insects,

bugs,

fish,

honey if they can
get it.

I guess they'd probably eat
spaghetti.

Pretty much anything, they're
like garbage disposals.

Why this sudden interest in
bears?

Just interested.

Uh,

do you like my Dad?

He's my brother.

You don't see each other much.

Well I guess we don't have
that much in common.

Wedloe.

What are you
doing about that bear?

I'm eating, Fog.
And I'm a taxpayer,

my taxes are paying
for that meal.

Fog...

I lost another
sheep last night

up in my high pasture.

All right well in the
morning, Pete and I, we'll go
check it out.

And keep your men out of the
area this time,

they stomp all over
the good tracks.

There is a bear out there
after my sheep,

if you don't do
something about it,

I will,

even if I have to go
in the preserve

to get the job done.
Are we clear?

That's not a very good idea,
Fog.

Let's get some air, come on.

Smell how fresh that air is?

It's pretty amazing huh?

Yeah.

Mark,

your Dad is a

tough man to live up to.

Everything is always a
competition with him.

He always has to win.

I'm not built that way.

I, I like it here,

you know, things are

simple,

clear.

This whole situation is,

it's just very difficult.

Don't worry about it.

I can just go and live with
Grandma May.

No Mark...

You know, it's okay.

You don't have to tell me you
don't want me here.

That's not what I'm saying.

It's just

so new

to me, this whole thing.

I, I'm, I'm probably going to
mess up now and again,

I just don't want you to think
that it's your fault.

Yeah.

Mom and Dad used to say that if
we fought before they left,

just this time they might not be
coming back.

[Ben - growling and groaning]

Uncle Jack's not the
best cook but

here you go.

Do you say thank you?

Sounded like you did.

I don't believe it
but I think I
can understand you.

[Ben groans]

Well, you're welcome.

Book says you got to drink so.

There you go.

I know what it's like being
stuck in a place you don't want
to be.

I'll get you out, I promise.

I said I promise

and I will.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Mr. Wedloe?

Hi Ashley come on in.

Is Mark here?

No, no,
I thought he was with you.

Well I haven't seen him for a
couple of days now.

Really?

If you see him,

tell him I'm still alive.

Okay.


I can't figure out how to
get you out without telling
my uncle.

But if I tell my uncle,

Fog Benson might find out

and you really don't
want to meet him.

He's not a big fan of bears.

You know, if I wasn't sure,

I'd say you and I do understand
each other, bear.

You do want out, right?

I don't know how.

I'll be right back.

Stay on one side, bear.

Go on, climb up.

Uncle Jack gave me a book about
bears and it says you can.

It's like a tree.

The book says bears can climb
trees.

All right,

it's like this.

Dee, knock it off.

Morning fellahs.

Hey ranger.

Hey you guys happen to see my,

uh, my nephew exploring the
trails

in the mountains or anything
like that, have you?

Nope.

Put your hand down.

He's doing my caricature.

Oh, how's your study going?

Good, probably be done in a
few weeks.

Ah thanks guys, appreciate it.


Easy bear.

Cully says bears can be as
gentle as a lamb.

Are you that way?

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make
you mad.

You're out of the hole,

so go home.

It's better if you stay away
from this place

so you don't get stuck
in a hole again.

Say why don't you and your
brother

take a look at the trails up
around your place?

Pete take a couple of men,

do a wide circle around town.

Ashley took Mark up to the old
mine,

he wanted to go inside.

Yeah maybe he went down around
the lake area.

Jack, look.

Hi.

Where you been?

I got lost up there, I'm
sorry.

We started a search party for
you, Mark.

Uh, I'm sorry you guys.

Thank you guys for coming out,

I'm sorry about that.

I needed to go for a walk.

I needed to think about stuff.

I told you before,

this is not a
city park out here.

You get lost out here,

you get yourself into some
serious trouble,

do you understand that?

I'm sorry, okay?

You know what,
go to your room.

Go.

Mark.
Hey, hey, hey, let him go.

Well that takes care of that.

He could have gotten into some
serious trouble, Pete,

and you know it.

Yeah.

Besides Social Services is
coming out here,

they're probably just waiting
for me to screw something up

so they can send him back to
California

and stick him in a foster home.

Are you sure that's not what
you want?


Mark?

Can I come in?

Yeah it's your place anyways.

I'd like to talk to
you for a minute.

I know,

I'm a big disappointment right?

No Mark that's not it.

I just need you to be real
careful out there, okay?

Mom and Dad were careful, it
didn't help them.

Let's not give up hope on
them.

Tomorrow somebody from Social
Services is coming out

to see if we're getting along.

So maybe we ought to try to get
along,

what do you think?

I'm going to read now.

I, I, I'm sorry if I
overreacted,

I was just worried about you.


we haven't heard anything for
days.

Do you have any information
about my brother and his wife?

Honestly Mr. Wedloe that's not
my department.

I'm just here to check on the
boy.

Yeah.

No offense.

Hey Mark, well this is, uh,

this is Miss, Miss Washborough,

she's from Social Services.

Hello Mark.

So why don't we all go for a
walk?

Great, show her the way.

Um hmm,
yeah good.

Is there a,

a time limit

or some sort of a schedule where
they would,

uh, tell me or determine...

We'll let you know as soon as,
information I,

they're doing the best they can
that's all I can really say.

Oh God.
Oh, oh, no, no, no it's okay,

that's just Harvey.

Shoo Harvey.

Get.

It's okay, he's as tame as a lap
cat.

Honestly, I have strong doubts
about this place.

Wild animals,

wilderness,

do you like being here Mark?

Uh, um,

I, I, um . . .

Mark?

Well

how do you like it here, Mark?

I got to go meet some friends.

It was nice meeting you Miss
Washborough.

Mark, Mark.


Well at least he's
made some friends.

What are you doing here?

I told you to go home.

Yes.

If anyone sees you here,

it'll be a big mess.

All right, come on.

[Mrs. Washborough] Mr. Wedloe I
am not entirely impressed

with your discipline skills.

Miss Washburn . . .

Washborough.

Washborough, I apologize.

You seem to be somebody who is

genuinely concerned with Mark's
well-being.

Um hmm, and?

I have to be honest with you,
I'm not

so sure that Mark
belongs here myself.

And I don't know if I'm prepared
to be an instant father.

So you have doubts yourself?

Yes ma'am.

Knowing you have doubts is a
very serious matter to me.

I'm glad you admitted it.

It means you're
thinking it through,

grasping the importance.

Anyone who doesn't feel the
rumble of contemplating

all that's stake is a fool.

Keep up the good work.

But I will monitor the situation

and expect reports every week.

Yeah.

Listen, you got to
get out of this place.

Even my uncle is
looking for you.

And, and you couldn't have
gotten those sheep

because you were stuck in the
hole, right?


I can't save you all the time.

I'm planning on leaving this
place anyway.

I hate these woods,

and I hate this place.

I'm all alone.


But at least no one's hunting
me.

Can you do that, bear?

[quiet groan]

No, all the way up like the
picture.


Can you roll over too?

[dogs barking]

Come on, let's go check it out.

[dogs barking rapidly]

Mr. Wedloe I have a problem.

[dogs barking]

Can't you shut those dogs up?

What difference does it make

they'll probably missed
anyway.

Down bear.

There, right there.
Get down.

Thank you.

Hold those dogs back,

we don't want them tearing into
this fox.

Oh yeah he's just fine,

he's dreaming.

Likely well and sleeping.
Yeah.

That rings the bell for the
buyer,

that's top cash right there,

That's good.
Yes siree.


You know something strange
here,

they're not even interested in
the fox.

I think there's something else
around here.

Something big!

Let's get out of here.

You know,
there's something else here.

There's something.

[dogs growling and barking]

[action music]

I can lead those guys away,

you're going to have to cross
the water.

I need you to get
your scent on me.

I saw this in a movie once.

The dogs will think I'm you.

Well he's got
something for us.

Ho ho.

Go on bear, go.

Go, go.


we found the bear in an old mine
hole.

I think Mark's been going back
to feed it.

It couldn't have killed Dad's
sheep.

Well maybe the bear got out of
the hole.

Ashley June.

I told him about the bear,

he's real mad.

Uh, he's always mad.

Hey Fog.

Ashley.
Daddy I told you about the
bear so you wouldn't hurt him.

And I thought I told you to
stay home.

I want you to get on your bike,
I want you to go home now!

Tell Mark I'm sorry.

Now!

Well it looks like your nephew

just saved me a whole lot of
trouble.

Hey Fog,
I'm responsible for the animals
around here.

Yeah, yeah.

Something's happened,

I think they lost
the trail or something.

One of them wants
to go this way,

the other one wants
to go the other.

They're confused, come on.

Come on dogs get up.

Up hey we're back down now,

come on let's go.

[dogs barking]

[action music]

Get on, faster.
Get on.

Don't lose them,
old boy.

Ray, Ray.

Well why are we stopping here
Daddy?

Ray go get your gear

I'm going to pick up
or I'll meet you in 20 minutes.

Because you're going to stay
here until I get back.

Back from where?

I got some unfinished
business.

I shouldn't have said
anything.

Honey you did the right thing,
now go on.

Dakota said she'll
baby- sit you all right?

Ray, get the lead out, go.

Baby-sitter?

Now what are you doing here,
hmm?

Mark?

Where you been?

Nowhere.

Ashley told me about the bear.

What bear?

Apparently the kids found a
bear

trapped in the old mine.

Uh, the old mine,

do you want us to go down there
and, uh...

No, no that's my job.

I was about to go
do that right now

but I think Mark and I have to
have a little talk first.

Inside.

Thanks for finding him guys.

Uh, uh, it was a good thing we
found him, huh?

A real good thing.

me Uncle Jack,

I think they're poachers.

Mark,
Gittis and Norwood helped him.

I saw them shoot a fox with a
dart gun.

That's what they do, Mark.

They tag animals so that we can
study them

and the entire eco system.

Well come on, Mark,

I don't even know what to say to
you anymore.

All right,

so you say that you
and the bear can talk?

No not really talk,

but we can understand each
other.

Cully put those ideas in your
head didn't he

with all those
bear stories of his?

No.

I want to believe you, Mark,

I really do.

But bears are just not friendly
to people,

let alone little boys.

I am not a little boy.

I want you to stay here

until I've had a chance to check
this out,

do you understand me?

Fine.

Crazy kid,

he could have gotten himself
killed.

People and bears just don't
become friends.

Not out here,
it doesn't happen.

I admit it sounds like a crazy
story, Jack,

but it has happened.

Now is not the time for Indian
legends, Pete,

this is ridiculous.

It's dangerous.

Maybe,

maybe he would be better
off in a foster home.

Where you going?

You're going to
go help the bear.

You don't understand.

See you.

Try me?

How do you even know he's
going to be there?

I think he lives at the mine.


Mark?

[LAUGH]

Looks like we found us another
bear Norwood.

Shoot.

Kid must of got him out.

I see that Nor.

They got a fresh scent.

Go dog, get him dog.
Get him.

Let's go.
Ow.

Hey.
Hello.

Did you happen to see Mark
come by here?

No, why?

I guess I
am screwing up,

I think he ran away.

Pete and I are up to the old
mine right now

see if we can find him.

If he comes by here,

hang onto him will you?

Yeah.

Thanks.

They beat us.

They're after the bear.

Come on,

we got to get to him first.

All right I'm not waiting for
the ranger to take care of this,

$500 to the man who brings that
bear down.

We can split up.

I'm going to head northwest.

If you sight the bear

I want you to call me on the
radio.

Yes sir.
Go on.

[ominous music]

There.

He's ahead of them.

Bear.

Bear we gotta go.

I don't believe it.

I never saw a wild bear that you
could get this close to.

He's not any bear,

he's my bear.

We gotta go.

There's a cave right over
there that we can hide in.

Okay but you're going to
have to lead them away.

Rub your clothes on him.

What?

You got to get
your scent on him,

the dogs will follow his scent.

It's worked before.

I, I don't know.

Ashley just trust me,

I did it.

Come on.

It's okay.

Come on.

Come on rub his scent
on you, come on.

Good bear.

What's the matter?

Find him.

What are we going to
do about the bear's
scent leading in here?

Insect repellant.

To cover his trail.

Thanks.

So where you going to take him?

Where all bears are safe.

Good luck.

Go on, boy.

Good boy

Stay on it.

What?

Norwood what?

I don't know they've lost it
or something,

they're confused.

Just be patient.

Oh they, they
found something there.

Come on, let's go,
what are you up for?

Come on let's go.

We're going to Grizzly Valley.

Gittis and Norwood.

Um, did you ever see a couple of
conservationists

drive a ground ripper like this?

Nope.

Whoa, whoa,

isn't that illegal search?

Just looking for my hat.

Lot of drugs here for
catch and release.

They're poachers Jack.

Working for a
private zoo in Europe.

Man.

Well I guess we know what
happened

to our two missing bears.

[ominous music]

That's my daughter's jacket.

She's suppose to
be back in town.

What would she
be doing out here?

I don't know but it
has something

to do with that Wedloe boy,

I can bet you that.

I want to be the first person
that catches up with them kids.

Uh, let us find her for you,

we, we can do that.

I'm coming with you.

These dogs are going
to come in handy.

That wouldn't be
a good idea see...

Hey, hey see
she's my daughter.

We're going to head back
the way you guys came

until the dogs pick
up a fresh trail.

Let's go.

Go.

Where's Mark?

We're trying to save the bear.

From Gittis and Norwood,
we know.

It'll be better for Mark

and the bear if we find him
first.

All he told me was

that he was going
where bears are safe.

Grizzly Valley.

Yep.

I told you to hold onto him
Norwood.

Well wait,

I'm sure they won't hurt people.

Now what are you boys really
looking for here?

Well we're going to help you
find your daughter.

That ain't the Wedloe boy.

Well hold it,
hold it,

hold it a minute.

That's all.

We're going to help you find
your daughter but, uh . . .

All right give it to me
straight here boys,

what exactly are you after?

The bear.

I'm going with you.

That way I can show
you where I left him.

You already told us where,
I know the spot.

Mr. Wedloe please.

Ashley you're going to turn
your bike around,

you're going to peddle straight
to Dakota's

you understand me?

But.
No buts.

Yes sir.

Are you ready?

Well I guess that
means we're leaving.

Come here, smell this.

Good boy.

Good boys.

See I told you they'd wait.

All right let's get back on it.

Get the bear,
get the bear.

They're on it.


I know, I know I'm hungry too.

It's the last one.

Here.

You like it?

[dogs barking]

Come on we gotta go.

So you think these kids are
with this bear, huh?

Well according to my GPS they
are, uh,

headed north, what's up there?

It's Grizzly Valley.

I never seen a grizzly up
here, that's a myth.

Uh, it's a
story people made up

to keep everybody
away from the gold.

Gold?

Oh yeah, lots of gold

and lots of snakes.

I don't like snakes.

Well since you seem to know
where we're headed

why don't you head us to a
shortcut?

Come here you dang
things, come here.

Well they're pulling hard, they
want something.

It's a deer.

Yeah they got a little
excited.

It seems a
little too excited to me.

Come on let's go to Grizzly
Valley.

I'm on your back Norwood.

I can't go any farther.

I gotta rest.

I'm going to stay here tonight.

Good.

[wolves howl]

Let me know if they
get too close.

[wolves howl]

These dogs, uh,

once they find a
bear they go after it?

These dogs are all muscle,

can take down an elephant.

You'd be surprised what they
could do.

Norwood.

This is all we need right here.

What are you doing?

See that?

Put your hand down.

[wolves howling]

Ah, that'll hold us.

Ah.

Think Mark found a
safe place to sleep?

I think the bear will protect
him from the wolves.

It's just so hard to believe.

[single wolf bark and howl]

It's old wolf talking to his
relatives now.

Indian legends.

I was raised with them.

You know, my people have a story

about Jamickwa.

The mother bear who found the
lost boy in the woods

and raised him as her own.

One time on a hunt,

living in the woods,

my people called him Lamitta

Human who thinks like bear.

Oh when other humans came

I'll bet he could see that the
grizzlies would be destroyed.

So he gathered them all,

and he led them
to Grizzly Valley.

Do you believe that?

Well sitting out here

alone with the stars

and creatures of the night,

what do you believe?

We'll find him, Jack.

I believe that.

[Ben quietly growls]

Good morning, bear.

A jelly donut would taste good
right about now.

Come on, we got to get out of
here.

How many?

Three men,
two dogs.

Gittis and Norwood.

And by the looks of it,

Fog Benson.

This dart could bring down a
rhino.

There's a lot of footprints.

It's pretty obvious where
they're headed.

And there's wolf prints too.

Let's go.

[dogs barking]

Come on get the bear.
Come on move.

The book says

that this time of day

the shadow should
be pointing north.

Cully says the Three
Sisters are north.

That way.

Come on bear.

[bear grunts]

There it is.

The Three Sisters.

Once you're in Grizzly Valley,

they'll never find you.

You'll be safe.

Come on bear.

Do you see anything?

Nothing moving.

Well,

we'll catch them soon.

The trail is pretty fresh, isn't
it Norwood?

It's not going to
get any fresher Gittis.

What about the ranger?

Well, we'll take care of that
when the time comes.

Whoa, whoa, there,

the ridge,

just below Three Sisters, right
there.

I don't believe it.

I've never seen anything
like it

in my whole life
that's for sure.

The boy, the bear,

let's go.

Come on,

come on dog get bear,
get bear.

[dogs barking very close]

Grizzly Valley.

We made it.

This is as far as I go bear.

[bear groans]
No,

I can't go there.

It's your place.

I don't belong there any more

than you belong back where we
came from.

No.

We agreed.

I'd take you here but I can't go
with you.

I'm going to Los Angeles

and I don't belong
back there either.

[bear moans]

I gotta go now.

Go.

Go you dumb bear.

I don't need you.

I don't need anybody.

[Bear Growls!]

There we go.

Let's go.

Well Norwood look who we ran
into.

Where's the bear boy.

Keep them dogs away
from the boy.

Where's the...
[Bear roaring]

I'll shoot him,

get back, get him Gittis.

Norwood.

What are you waiting on, shoot
him.

Bear stop.

Please stop.

Dart him.

What are you waiting on?

Stop.
Don't shoot him.

He's just protecting me.

Now get out of the way son.

No.

Don't shoot Fog,

don't shoot.

You don't need to shoot him,
it's okay.

You're sure, Mark?

Yeah, he won't hurt anybody

he's just protecting me.

We were trying to protect the
boy, ranger.

Yeah.

Fog, you have no business
being up here.

I'm here because that bear
attacked my sheep.

Bear didn't hurt your sheep.

Oh you don't,

that boy doesn't know anything.

Go ahead, Mark.

We found the bear trapped in a
mine hole.

The bear was in the hole when
your sheep were taken.

That's what Ashley said.

The kids are lying to
save the bear.

My daughter don't lie.

The bear took your sheep.

Something smaller than a

bear took your sheep Fog,

it was a wolf or dog.

Yeah.

I saw their dog, he almost
killed a fox.

They had to pull him back.

You are such a little liar.

No, honest.

The boy is right Wedloe.

I've been studying these dogs,

they're out for blood.

All right,

all right that's it,
that's it,

I got six CCs of tranquilizer in
this gun,

that's enough to drop an
elephant,

you can imagine what it can do
to a man.

Show down is over,
put your weapons down.

Put them down.

Don't make it any worse than
it already is guys.

Norwood you and I are getting
out of here.

Well you aren't
getting very far.

I got 24 hours before they
miss you

and then I got another 24 hours
before they come

and they find you.

Norwood, would you give
me those dogs,

get their rifles.

Now bear.

[bear growls]

All right you,

let it go, let it go.

Don't ever call my
daughter a liar.

Come on.

Good job, bear.

Good job.

I see it,

I still don't believe it.

In all my years I've only seen
one bear this friendly.

I'm still not so sure about
this Cully.

Tell them what you told me
about the eyes.

Well I told you that when you
look into the bear's eyes,

you can see he's an old soul.

And the way he is with you,

I kind of think of him as a
gentle giant.

He is.

Ben is a gentle old soul.

Ben?

Ben?

Ben?

It's Ashley's idea.

I named him after Mark's Dad.

That's a good name.

Come on Mark,

let's take Ben for a swim.

That bear has no idea

what he's getting into with the
two of them.

Ranger, are you going to let
that bear just hang around town?

The bear's name is Ben, Fog.

Ben?

You named the bear Ben?

That's right, so get used to
it.

Wedloe,

you're an idiot.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Yeah, yeah.

It seems as if Mark
and Ben came together

when they needed
each other the most.

I'm not sure how things are
going to end up for each of
them,

but what I am sure of is this,

it will be an
interesting journey.

[majestic music]
