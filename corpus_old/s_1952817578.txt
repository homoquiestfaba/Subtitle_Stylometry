Storm Lake, Iowa

Wakey wakey

Get out of my face

You still got a pool?
Sure. Its in the top right drawer.

Nature calls

Don't shoot. I'm a US citizen.
Honest!

Scared me half to death.

I'll take her home

She says the bike's her own but it can't be.
It's a thousand dollar bike.

Look. I borrowed the bike.

You're in trouble miss.

I am trouble mister

OK. Lets say 3 o' clock.

And look I'm gonna have to postpone
that trip to Houston.

My son's in town. I know. I know
But it'll wait

They need me

Well, its good to see you boys again.

Still working weekends on the
garage, Gregorio?

Ahh. That's me. Actually I'm thinking
of helping my dad out with his business.

Mar√≠a I'll have those eggs now por favor.
And you Greg?

Still at the library Mr. Welch.

But I'm thinking of taking some night classes.
Good for you.

We still miss your father

He was one of our finest at the border patrol.

Boys, sorry to say..

but i've got to steal David for a couple of hours
this afternoon. Father and son, you know

Heart to heart

We miss him didn't we George?

He begged to fly home weekend after weekend.
I said no, wait till spring break

and show 'em what your made of.
And they will show you the...

The ladder to the top

Dad

My son needs his studies and the sports.
And what with his looks

God knows how much sex

Dad they're not interested.
But they are! Aren't you boys?

Maria some more syrup for George here
and Greg here, have another donut.

My son. Straight A's. 
Sports trophies up the yin yang.


Landed at the 5th best school in the nation.

And now..
You're boring them Dad.

Well then entertain us my son.
Tell us what's new.

Quit!
I got a call from the dean last night.
What do you suppose he had to tell me?

Christ!

We must bring our entertainment to a close

David. Noon at my office.

Its good to see you boys.

What's your Dad so pissed about?
You and me Greg, he thinks we're trash.

Nothing to do with you

I'm not on break from school.
I was suspended

What?
You cut classes?

I went to all my classes

And got naked
Bullshit!

Sitting in class one day I just felt
constricted so I took my clothes off

Piece by piece
I left my socks on though

Sat the entire way through 
my first class bare-assed

And the second class someone objected.
It was a political science class.

That is fucked up man.
What are you gonna do?

What gets me is how long it took anyone to object. 
Nobody asked me what the hell I was doing.

They just pretended I was dressed.

Ok, why'd you do it?

They were asleep. Fuckin' zombies.

They needed a wake up call
Jesus. You put your nuts on display 
for the whole world to see. No way!

I was tired of waking up every morning
and thinking what the fuck am I doing here?

So I shed my skin and headed home.
Adios duke! This is where I wanna be.

We love you too buddy

How you doin' David?
You back from spring break?

I thought I should check in with my boys
Well, give your father my regards

Return of the conquering hero eh?

We missed you, George says he can at least
write a postcard and I say you got hands, write him yourself

But no...

Hey Cactus, you look good on that bike

George, George sweetheart I need your help a minute.

Cortex Taxi Service. Always running.

Saw it on a film

Got to go

Take this and get rid of it.


Thanks boys.
I don't know where she keeps finding them.

Brought you another book

Griffiths - These Are The Times
Yeah, these are the times

How about tonight?
What exactly is your criteria for choosing my books?

When I was on the return pile

You know I'm risking jail 
stealing these books for you

You owe me a date
Not tonight

Tomorrow night?

I know that happened

Yeah, everyone knows what happened

You know her?

So we got a date tomorrow or what?

Well, it's a start I guess

You got a sweetheart up at Duke?

Someone special?

I haven't met any of them too special

Things ok? You seem kinda...
Jumpy?

Here have my sandwich. I'm not hungry.

You lost weight.
Dad, what's the problem?

Tell it to me straight
Debts, David

Lean and mean times

It's always something. So...

you got to take risks and when you do
everybody gets a little jumpy

But you stick with it. 
Competition strangles the best of us

It's knowing how far you can bend
the rules of the game

Tell me Dad, you know you can trust me

My trucks carry all sorts these days

And so you have to make arrangements
with the border patrol

Jesus Dad

Drugs?
Televisions

Designer Jeans
Black market?

I knew it
It's called the free market

But my concern is your future not mine

Listen Dad, I got this all figured out
I quit school, I stay here with you

It'll be like you used to say
after mom died

"It's just you and me now we've got to stick together"

And we can do that here working side by side


Go on

I'm natural when it comes to business
I don't need a degree in law

I've got everything I need right here
We'll take over, you and me

Are you finished?
No, Dad remember?

It's the wild west out there
and we can tame it

You're going back to school
No, Dad, listen

How did you think I've felt when that dean called me?
And why did you pull such a pathetic stunt?

For attention? We're you feeling lonesome?
Did you need a hug?

You have no idea. You think I didn't try to fit in?
Huh? That I didn't try to make it work?

The only place that I'm happy is here with you.

I'm not going back

I love you, but you are going back to school
and you're gonna be the best damn lawyer in the state

Things are gonna work out just like we planned
Fuck him! Fuck! Fuck!

Would you two like to make some serious money?
How?

TVs, truckload. Easy steal, risk free

From my Dad

That's low
That's scraping the bottom of the barrel

I'm in

No. I'm..
To a parent like that? It's like Original Sin

So? He won't miss 'em.
They're black market from Mexico

Whose gonna complain? And no one will suspect us

I'm in

You already said that. Give me back my hat

I'm getting out of here. I'm not wasting myself

Shit

How much are we talkin'?

Thousands

Hey, put the books back on the shelves

Why are you doing this to your Dad?
Coz it's a thrill

And we need a thrill. Fuck it
Fuck it?

Cmon David don't bullshit me

What the hell's with you?

Talk to me or I'll hit you

I don't know

I don't fuckin' know

It's ok, I guess

I missed you

Yeah

It used to be a frontier out here
Kill or be killed. Be a slave or be free

And now what are the choices that matter?
Paper, plastic, Lubricated rib?

Regular, decaf, eat in, take out
Pay to go or contract - To rent or to buy

Let's do it!

Fuck it!

Want to get us shot?

10:30. She's due

Where is everybody?
They'll hit the canteen before it closes at 10:30

It's cool. Done my homework

Does anyone else have a sense of doom?

Greg, bolt cutters are yours
Right boss

Log in, change in drivers. 
Tell a few jokes. Take a leak

Ok. you've got about 3 minutes.
Ready?

Let's go

Shit!

Are you sure its gonna be ok here?
Scrapyard will think its the army. Army will think its the scrapyard

Need to find someone to sell them to
Your Dad won't report it, right?

No way
Oh man. He's gonna be pissed

So when do we sell them?

We need to get down low in a few days.
We need to make an increase, right George?

How much time do you need?
Two, three days at the most

I know just the guy

Fuck it

Thank you

Always old fashioned.

One sugar donut

And six donut holes.

Make it quick

Got a long day ahead of you partner?
Long enough

You heading for the border?

You with the law?
Whose law?

Roger, Slater, morning

Roger listen, bad news. We had a theft last night

Yeah. Fully loaded

Of course I do. That's not it
I didn't want to wake you

Trust me I'm taking care of this

Yeah, I'm gonna send them out to
find the usual suspects

Exacly. Relax

Relax, we'll find it

I'll call you back

I didn't get much sleep last night
It looks that way

Hey David you up for a swim?
I don't think so

Well, I'll leave you alone then..

What the hell?

Zero out of ten for that dive.

What's up Dad?

One of our trucks was stolen last night
Shit

Can we get it back?
Unlikely

Our concern now is to find out who took it
and keep a lid on this

This is a well planned operation

Professionals?
Yeah

But we've got our own professionals 
who will find them.

In the meantime, you just get your head ready
to get back to your educaton

I'm gonna fuck who ever did this

None of your fuckin' business

Don't move

Did they hurt you?

I got a hard knee
I don't look like an illegal, do I?

I just got mugged. I think I'm owed
to something nice. Nourishing.

Nourishing?

You need to teach me how to make donuts

Howdy
Hi honey

Where's Kat?

She went to get you donuts
Hey hey, on the nail please

Old tuber Tyler says he saw you the other night
Oh yeah?

Still out with the border patrol?

I would rather not you doing your partying on the border
We're not partying out there mom

Patrol's worth shit without us

Hey, I will not have that kind of
trash talk in this family

Sorry mom

When I was five, I used to sit on
his shoulders and play drums on his head

We used to be friends, but now
I'm just a beaner to him

The ones that are here I love
but the others I don't know about

Have you given up a daughter?

Maybe you forgot

Me too, I have to get this
donuts to my brother

Not so thick. Just half an inch

How come you don't have a boyfriend?

Now, If I make the perfect donut...

Will you go out with me?

I like older women

Older women. The way you say it
sounds like you starters

Show me

Now those are perfect donuts

What time should I pick you up?

Mom, I want to be a vision to the devil himself

My devil is out back

Great, did you chew them up especially for me?

I got them for you
Have you seen your pillow?

Who cares about my pillow?

Who cares?

Shit. You know what when you came to us as a baby I used to spit on your head everytime I walk by your cradle cause I knew how you'd turn out

You liar

Speak English, Jesus!

I'm just waiting for the day you disappear to 
one of your detours so I can have some peace

Why don't you move out like a real adult

and give me some air to breath?
It's an embarrassment to be your sister.

Look at your skin

Your not my sister

Yeah, I am

Where to sir?

Anywhere but here

Didn't ever bother you and mom when you adopted her?

Never

She's not one of us

What bothers me is whats what I knew

I'm just a regular shit

Hey give me a smoke will you?

Me and David

We're gonna make some money

And were gonna travel

Sorry I got no cash

Walch, your name is Walch?
Yup, that's me

Slater Walch?
My father

I don't want your money.
You're not welcome here, please leave.

Wait a minute...
Tell your father his business stinks

I'll have no part of it. Go

I have to meet George and David later
on at the Old train depot

You ever been there?

Well, we used to hang there when
we were kids, you should come.

Ok, but I've got to stop by
at the garage first and check a leak

So it's a date right?

Don't count on it

You used to wear that T-shirt back on tenth grade.
Look cool on you then

Thanks
Looks cool on you now

Shit. Have to fix that

He's pretty pissed about the truck

I thought he'd just ride it off
I said he'd be pissed

He's pissed

Well I'm a thief, you're a thief

Right?

Right

So you got a girl up at dock?

Girl up in dock to fuck me

No time

Well I'm gonna introduce you to some of my ladies. 
Show you the spell of relief

Keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't steal anything

You know of anyone who could use some TV's?

My little girl wants one in her room

How many you got?
A truck load

Do I look like someone who could use a truckload?

I'm dirty because I'm a mechanic
not a criminal

Besides nothing good on TV in it, right

What about a legit ID? You have driver's license

I'll give you forty dollars
No, thank you

Why not? You can get another one

I thought you weren't a criminal?
Helping poor folks get a job, criminal?

I'm not giving my ID to some illegal

Why?
Coz you're legal?

I was born this side of the border

Really?

Which border?

That one?

What if I just stepped across your
border like it wasn't even there?

I'll give you a dollar for a smile

No, maybe a quarter

Can I kiss you?
No

Do you wanna hear something funny?

I'm still a virgin
What?

Do I have to say it again?

I'm a virgin. Ok?
Wow

But hey I mean, I don't need a map

I just never did the.. you know..
all the way

But I'm a fast learner

Give me your best shot trailer trash

Oh I'm so jealous my Daddy 
can't buy me a new truck

Nope

We just got this old taxi and
drive in circles forever

You know? I didn't miss you, fratboy!

Old high school game. See who flinches first

Greg always lost

Want to get something to eat?
How about some dogs?

All this time

You've been the donut lady
Now here you are

What do you mean? That I'm an ancient
and I'm mark from the neighborhood with

surprise, suprise, little life still left in her?

Or that I'm an aztec statue?
That miraculously comes a lot than all her fierce beauty.

Any other choices?
Have some respect fratboy

I can take care of myself.
Hey Gregorio

Did you hear about those uh...

six greasers who fell asleep on the railroad tracks
there are strips of bacon by the morning.

George you're ruining my appetite

The six less of Greg's compadres 
over here to steal my job
 

What job? You don't do beaner jobs

Oh wow, what a date. Grade school fighting
and trashing beaners at the same time

How do you boys do it?
We ain't pleased baby

Didn't Greg told you?
We're the war boys

Back in high school, we used to have
chicks like you running scared.

How frightening. This little wetback
is just shivering in her slippers

She's... an aztec beauty

and she's shivering in her slippers

She's an aztec beauty...

I'm getting dizzy

Stop it!

Stupid gringos!

All of you

Shit

I was always alone in high school

Most of the kids in my class were white

Then one of them asked me to join the war boys.

You know, it was on of those chase the 
beaners high school club

Sometimes we'd spot an illegal and
call the border patrol

Sometimes we chase them in our cars

Mostly we drove around and made noise

We never hurt anybody

Not everyone just drove around.
People got hurt

Some people get killed.

Not by us

When they asked you to join the 
war boys, did you think you were white too?

I was ready to be anything they 
wanted me to be

And now?

What do you wanna be?

With you
And what would you do to be with me?

Anything

I don't believe you
Try me

Ok

Show me that you want me
How?

Come

Come where?

Just come. Right here. Now

Your kidding?
It's payback for your little stunt back there

No way

All right well, I'm going home

Wait, sit down, sit down

Talk to me

How?
Just talk, just talk

Tell me something nice

Talk to me

Breathe

What else do you want me to do?

We're sorry
Yeah

I was really obnoxious, ok?

Well look, we'll make it up to you Marta

So look, we're going boating

I don't think so

What do you mean boating?

Well here's our lady - Marta de Asis
We'd like to talk to you alone

Who were you?
You used to work for Welch Trucking?

I was a temp driver for a lot of different
companies but that was a long time ago

What do you want with her?
Stay out of this

They've got a truck stolen. They're very upset
That's too bad for them

That's not my line of business

We found out that you and your wetback friends
have anything to do with this, it's gonna hurt. Comprende?

I gotta go. I should go home

Wait a minute, stay with me

I'm sorry

Damn

This here is a pretty thorny mess

Goddamnit! You're pulling askew with those things

Last one's in deep

I think I can feel your breath on my ass

Is that your breath on my ass?
I'm trying to get the thorns out, will you shut up?

Are you getting the thorns out of my ass
or you know...

touching... my ass

I'm touching your ass to get the thorns out

I just want to make sure the
lines don't get crossed here

They got crossed some years ago

Once

And I hardly remember it

I remember everything

The only thing that felt better
than you putting your hand on me...

is when I put my hand on you

Shut the fuck up.
We we're just kids

Sure

And you know where that line is now don't you?
You damn right I do

So just to be certain...

Why don't you tell me where it is?

Is it here?

Most definitely. Yup 

So that means... I could touch you here?
Right?

All american ok. Check

And...

Here?

David, I know who I am

What if I crossed it?

And touch you here

Say you want me

Get the hell away from me

All right

All right

What would it mean if I said that
I wanted you?

Anything you want?

No, no, go to the garage

Our plan is fucked
What?

Your Dad has sent goons
to find out who took the truck

They found Marta
What's Marta got to do with any of this?

Hell if I know. They were at her place
You didn't tell Martha, did you?

Hell no. Shit man this is serious

Drugs, drugs, it's gotta be drugs
George is right

There's something else
This isn't about TV's

There is now way that they would get this 
hired for some TV's, there's drugs in that truck

They were TV's, my Dad wouldn't lie to me
Wake up idiots. We need to make an anonymous call 
and tell them where the truck is

Get out
No, no fuckin' way. We didn't do all this for nothing

We wait till tomorrow

When it's light, less conspicuous.
We search the truck, take what we can carry

leave the rest then
we make the call

If they get 90 percent of
their shit back, they're gonna be happy

George is right, we can't walk 
out of this empty handed

It's gonna be alright. So will Marta

Hey Greg wait up

You're going home?

You've been sitting there all night
Not moving

Are you dead or something?

Come here a minute

Sit

Look Kat, I've got to ask you something
If you've got something to ask, ask your sister

She's sitting right next to me

Yeah I guess she is.
Fire away

Something happened to me last night

It's like I was walking down this street

That I knew really well and..

I didn't even have to look to where I was going

And all of a sudden I've 
found myself somewhere I hadn't...

I've never been before

I feel like I've been there my
whole life

And I wasn't afraid anymore

What happened when you got there?

Well...

I kissed my best friend

David

On the mouth

You know, the way mom and dad
do sometimes

How come you don't like me?

Not that I don't like you Cat, 
it's just you're a..

different..
from me, that's all

Is that a bad thing?

No

I guess it's not

Are you gonna kiss David again?

I don't know

Maybe

What would you think about
having a brother like that?

You alright?

Look, if this is about last night
It has nothing to do with you

This is all shit
The truck those guys are looking for

We stole it.
What?

Welch Trucking Company, it's Davids' dad
Jesus Christ

But I want you to know we're going to return it
We're gonna bring it back

It'll be alright. We're gonna take care of it

What's in the truck?
Black market stuff

Televisons, I don't know
You don't know anything

We wanted to make some cash
I'm sorry you got involved

Trust me

We'll fix it

We're gonna take care of it today

High school punk

Stop worrying

I'm sorry

I'm really sorry

Turn over

Fratboy

Wait

It hurts

I'm not going in that pool

You're spending a little too much time
with that kid you can do better than that


You're David Welch

Yeah, I'm David Welch

But Welch is a dirty word to 
some around here

I got my credit card thrown
at my face, why is that?

We all make enemies in this business

What have you done?
What have I done?

Well, I paid the mortgage.
Sent you to an expensive university

Brought you a new truck

We used to tell each other everything

Yeah

There was a time when we did

No secrets

What change between us...

Why don't you go on and give
George a ride home now

Dad, there's something I need to tell you
Please, don't

Its this that conversation where the son
says to the father, "Guess what Dad, I'm a fag"

Well, if that's what you want

It's not a problem for me

But you could at least fuck somebody
whose got some class

George is dead end.
What could he ever do for you?

George knows who I am

Do you know what that feels like?

To have somebody to look at you
and know who you are and what you want

It's like waking up over and over again

And ever sine mom died you pushed me aside

I've never pushed you aside

I've pushed you to the top

I don't want you to be like me David
That would've been enough, to be like you

I want you to be better than me!
See that's the difference

I've always loved you
just as you are

And you've only fuckin' loved me
for how you want me to be

Cool, it looks like George

No, I understand perfectly Roger

No, of course

Of course!

You've got papers on all the goods in the truck?
Yeah, I've got paperwork there on the desk

For 500 bucks is a children's toys

Very cute. It's too cheap in Mexico

These are routine questions for a theft Mr. Welch,
I'm just doing my job

Well do your job Lane and watch my back

Maybe if you've done a little better watching
my back, we wouldn't have this God awful fuck up right now!

Shit, I thought you said he was coming alone?

What the hell did you bring her for?
Cause I know what assholes you are

Fuck you

Go home, we can take care of this

Have you ever seen how white
a knee cap is when it breaks the skin?

I have! And that's just for starters
These people will hurt you

Do you even know what's in there?
Yeah, drugs and TV's

We're taking some of both and
then we're gonna split

I had a friend who helped himself when no one was 
looking and after they crippled him, they put a knife in his gut

Shut your mouth, my father is no killer
You don't know what he is

I am not leaving empty handed

George don't!

Oh my god
What the fuck?

You gotta leave

You gotta go now.
Come on Greg

No, I'm staying

I know, I know

We'll get the stuff and drive the container out
into the dessert and dump it

Yeah, burn everything

No, I'll talk to the boys.
I'll see they understand

Listen to me Roger
I'm the one whose gonna deal with this

Roger I got enough on you, I warn you

You're gonna burn those?

Well I don't give a fuck about them right now.
I'm gonna get my son out there

And no one else counts? What about those people?
It's all just business to you?

Stop your moral bullshit please

I'm the one who gets them the shitty jobs and 
the packhouse in Iowa and sometimes things go wrong

But you risk nothing!
I risk everything that was important to me a long time ago

So you really think you can get away with this?

Don't burn them!

What are we gonna do?
Shut up I'll figure something out

It was your father's cargo.
Why didn't you know what was in there?

How could I know?

Over and over again I asked him, he wouldn't tell me...

We killed them!
I told you to shut up

Jesus we killed them

They must have been shouting!

To die like that? In the dark...

No one knew

We gotta bury them

They had families.
They had names

Where's George?

David get in the car.
Shut up I know what happened

George, you two take his truck and follow me

What about the semi?
They're gonna burn the semi. We're gonna clean up this mess

David you've got to get in the car
Boys get in the truck we don't have much time

David...

Who the fuck is that?
Dad?

You think I ran this game on my own?
Get in the car.

David, what's going on?

No, you can't burn them
Cmon. Get in the goddamn car

You can't just burn them!

I planned it Dad. It was me, 
I was the one who planned the whole thing
I don't care just move it

We need to tell the cops.
If he won't, I will

You're not getting away with this
Don't you dare threaten me you son of a bitch!

I will put you in the truck with 
the rest of them. One less wetback to deal with.

Get in the car!

Give me the gun
No secrets right Dad?

No secrets between us

You son of a bitch!

If you trusted me. If you've told me the truth

Stop! Stay where you are goddamnit!
