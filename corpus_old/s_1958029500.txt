Hello?

Hello?

Fuck!

Jesus Christ!

What is that sound?

I-
Is that me?

That's your phone.

Where's my phone?

Did I, oh, okay.

Shit.

It's my phone.

Shit.

It's my mom.

Hey, mom.

Where are you?

In the bathroom.

You are so full of shit.

Shut up.

I need you to get
your grandfather now.

Why?

Because I fucking said so!

Dad can't get him?

If I wanted dickless
to go get him,

I would've called him!

Off your ass and
pick him up now.

Fuck man.

She's always ruining
my high, man.

We gotta go.

I'm in a hurry.

I, I can't have her bitching
at me anymore than she is, man.

But, you know
what, where is my,

I do have something
else down here.

I got a little
nuggy or something.

Gotta hit like a Dewey
decimal system for my weed.

One of those little-

I, I can't pick
him up straight, man.

Hey, come here.

I got something.

I swear, man, I
have here some good.

Pack of chit, Brussels sprouts.

Brussels sprouts?

Not just any
Brussels sprouts, man.

I get these from my guy who
experiments on all my shit.

Oh.
Yeah, dude.

Have you tried it yet?

No, but it's a
beautiful Saturday.

We gotta pick up your grandpa.

First time for anything, right?

Yes.

Let's do it.

These get you so high though.

You feel like you're
gonna die, man.

Uh, die?

Mm-hm.

Not really, but it gets you
high really, really fast,

and it amplifies your
hunger by like 10,000.

Nothing wrong with that, man.

I know, right?

I love my Taco Bell.

Get some more, man, all right.

What's with the
keys and balloon, man?

Don't worry about the balloon.

It's for my sister's birthday.

My keys in there,
haven't lost them once.

All right?
All right, let's go.

Let's go pick him up.

All right, let's do this.

Hurry up, man.

Hang on, I'm locking
the door, okay?

Gotta get the sweet spot.

We gotta go, man.

My mom's gonna kill me.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

All right.

Hurry up.

Chill, bro.

We're here at the car.

We're good.

It's in there, man.

Never got anything
in here, man.

Why don't you
look under the raccoon?

What's this?
Told you, man.

That's good shit.

Yeah, man, yeah!

Right on.

Light it up.
Yeah, man.

And Mr. Raccoon's gonna be
on this trip to help us out.

Isn't that right, Mr. Raccoon?

You wanna hit
this Mr. Raccoon?

"Hell yeah, motherfucker!"

"Give me that shit."

Here you go.

"That is balls right there!"

You sit there, Mr. Raccoon.

You're our navigator.

All right, baby,
that is almost out.

Pass that shit before.

I feel much better, man.

Good, man.

We got this, we got this.

We'll get it back.

Let's get grandpa.

We're gonna get grandpa!

Ha ha!

We gonna get gramps!

Oh my goodness, it is not, it
is not gonna take its time.

I think it's gonna hit now, man.

Yeah, man.

Yeah, you know.

Oh, that hit the spot.

Okay.

You're gonna drive?

Yeah, man.

You're gonna drive, all right.

You drive.

Am I just really high

or do I live in front
of a fucking cemetery?

â™ª We're taking you prisoner â™ª

All right, man.

Let's go get grandpa.

Is this the fuckin' place?

Yeah, this
is the place, man.

This really it?

Okay.

Don't you see the old
geezers walking around?

Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Let's go get him.
Let's go take a look.

This is it.

I'm sure of it, man.

I'm telling you.

Hey mom.

Where the fuck are you?

I'm here.

I'm right outside, calm down.

Show me.

He's not fucking
there anymore, okay?

He's at 7th and Jet.

Shit.

Yeah, I told him that
you're headed there now, okay?

I'll send you the
God damn address.

Can you stop fucking smoking
for one God damn day?

Cock sucker.

Think there's any
GILF's in here, man?

What, man?

GILF's, man.

Find an old lady with some cash.

Fuck the shit out of her
and you're fucking set.

Hello?

I'm right here, you idiot.

Damn, man.

Well, I, I'm here to
pick up my grandpa.

All right, man.

Well, can you just go
get 'em from me then, or?

I'm on my lunch break.

What room number is in, man?

Fuck, man.

22.

Uh, you gotta sign in.

You gonna watch
do it, man, or?

You even know
what you're doing?

Uh, you forgot the time.

Damn, man.

Fuck, man, this guy.

They better pick
it up for me, man.

Signed in, man.

Have a good day.

Fuck you.

Oh, by the way, he's
having one of those days,

so enjoy your time.

Great.

Hey, no smoking
in here, you guys.

What was that?

You heard
me, fucking assholes.

Uh, it's his.
Thanks.

Fucking mall cop, man.

I still
don't understand

why you go to
these places alone.

You always get like this.

What?

Every time I'm getting
ready to leave for a shoot,

you always say this.

Newsflash, you don't get
paid enough for what you do.

And if I didn't do this,
I'd end up living in my car,

which at this point, I'm
not that far away from.

So first, you wanted
to be a carpenter,

and that lasted about what?

A month, and you turned your
living room into a tool shed.

I can't hear you!

"I can't hear you."

Come on, girl.

Now you wanna be an
aspiring photographer?

Jesus, just pick something.

Why don't you just live with me?

No thank you.

Hey, did you hear what I said?

What?

Move in with me.

We tried that once.

Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

Right.

Okay, then why don't you
just move in with your brother?

Fred?

Hell no, he's a freaking
slob in a major pothead.

What, what are you,
what are you doing?

It's 10.

And?

In the morning.

Eh.

Ah, speak of the devil.

What?

It's Fred, idiot
boyfriend, Mike.

Guy's such
a fucking loser.

And done.

Listen, I'm gonna be okay.

Are you five now?

Promise.

You know, for someone who
cares about me so much,

why don't you just come with me?

Okay, and see a bunch
of 90 pound bitches

pretend to be supermodels?

No thanks.

You sure?

Positive.

Okay, I'll see you later.

Heads up, Fred and Mike
might stop by later, so.

Good luck with that.

Also, don't make a mess.

Love you.

I don't think I can do
much more damage in here.

Hello?

Hey.

I missed you.

What is going on with you?

This isn't the first time I've
left for a shoot by myself.

I know, that's why this
time you're taking this.

What the hell, man?

I'm not taking that.

Yes you are.

And if you don't,
I'll stab you myself.

What has gotten into you?

Ah, don't worry about it.

I'm just gonna
leave it right here.

You won't even remember
that it's there

'cause of how busy you'll be.

Are you crazy?

Drive safe.

What the hell, man?

Oh.

God damn it.

Okay, I forgot my phone.

Gwen?

Gwen?

If you're trying to scare
me, it's not gonna work.

What the fuck?!

Fucking duct tape!

God damn it!

Fuck, fuck, fuck!

Fucking gross.

They need some elevator
music in here, man.

Whoa, what are you doing?

This is what I'm doing, pal,

and you're gonna join me.

We'll be quick.

Bet we're the first people to
do this shit in the elevator.

It's legal now.

No, I am not.

That guy was a
fucking turd, man.

What an asshole he was.

"Sign here, man."

"Oh, and then you gotta put
the time too," you know, like.

He didn't say bless
you when I sneezed.

Did you sneeze?
Yes.

I didn't say bless you.

Okay, I'm sorry.

I just had to deal with these
two fucking idiots earlier

that came in.

Yeah.

No, just degenerative
pothead fucking idiots.

You're okay.

I forgive you for that.
I do usually.

Yes.
Every sneeze, too.

Yes, yes, you give me weed.

If you sneeze
three times in a row,

I say it every time.

The day that
guy gives me weed,

then he can skip
out on bless you's.

Okay.

Hello?

What about Rambo, you know?

Like he's,

he's always been in
the jungle, every life.

Fuck, man.

I'm like Rambo.

You're right.

Oh, man.

Rambo, man.
Yeah, man.

Wait, who's Ram, is
that Schwarzenegger?

Sly.

The Italian stallion.
What?

Dig wat man.
Okay I don't.

What?

It's right, right?

I think.

I, I'm not, I'm not hip.

Hello?

Hey, take that.

We need to get my grandpa now.

Come on, man.

Let's get up.

What the fuck are
we doling, man?

The longer you keep knocking,

the longer you're gonna
have to wait, Sarah.

Ha ha, I'm not Sarah, grandpa.

I'm Mike.

No, you're the load that
should been swallowed.

I think something's
going on down there.

Come on, grandpa.

We gotta get outta here.

Dropped my bag.

Come on, bro.

Let's get outta you.

I'm not a fucking dog, okay?

Something
terrible's happening.

Julie Webb.

I'm trying to pick up
my grandma, Ruby Hayes.

Yeah, I, I tried the front
door, but it was locked.

Yeah, I tried knocking, but
no one came to the door.

Okay, I'll go back to the front.

Thanks.

Sarah, I'm not a
fucking mail built!

I knew this was gonna happen!

All right, grandpa.

He's really rude.

Yeah, this is Frank speaking.

Who?

No, I'm on my lunch break.

I can help her when
I get back inside.

I said I am eating
right now, George.

I'll help her when
I get back inside.

Look-

Fucking prick.

Help me, bro!

Oh, this is bad.

I knew this was gonna happen.

Go get it, ah!

What the fuck is,
what is going on?

Oh, bro!

Oh man.

They're real, old boy.

That was, that was not real.

As real as you and me.

Real as the weed I'm
smoking right now.

That was real, that was real.

Grandpa, you okay?

Hell is a factor

and the walls are coming
down in front of our faces!

No grandpa, no!

No, we can't go out there!

You saw them!

Let me go stare,
you fucking bitch

I'm ready to fight these cunts.

Oh, grandpa!

No, no, no, no, no, no!

Are you there?

If you guys don't leave,
I'm calling the cops.

Hey!

Come on, man.

I don't hear anything.

Are you there?

Hello?

What's going on
out there, man?

I don't know.

Ask him nicely.

Maybe you're being
too aggressive.

Hello?

Hey, call the fucking cops, man.

Okay.

What's, what's up, brother?

You okay, man?

Hey, hey, you okay, buddy?

That, that doesn't
sound good at all.

Fuck!

The fuck.

Fuck!

Who is it?

Who do you think it is?

Where the fuck are you?

Listen, mom,

mom, listen to me.

Something happened.

Something fucked up
is going on here, mom.

You're fucking
smoking that shit

and it's turning your God
damn brain into jello.

I'm not high, mom,
I swear to Christ.

The old people,
they're, they're sick.

They're, I don't know.

I don't know what's happening.

You know, I asked you
to do one fucking thing

and you couldn't
even handle that.

Something,
something's fucked up.

The old people, they're-

You know what?

I'm driving there now.

No, no, no, no, no.

You don't, don't
come down here, mom!

You're a fucking idiot!

Wow, wow.

Roads are blocked off
all throughout the coast.

The president just said

we are not allowed outside
in the streets at all

until further notice.

What the hell is going on?

911,
what is your emergency?

My name is Madison Walker.

I just killed a zombie
with a chainsaw.

Ma'am, this
line is for emergencies only.

This is a fucking emergency.

My best friend is dead.

You killed your friend, ma'am?

I didn't say that.

A zombie killed my best friend.

Ma'am,
I am going to hang up.

Are you fucking serious?

I need your help.

I've just killed something.

Ma'am, if
you remain on this line,

we will be sending an
officer to your location.

3127 Cedar Drive, you
stupid fucking cunt.

We just
logged your number

and we have your address

and we're sending that
to an officer nearby.

Fuck you.

Leave a fucking message.

Fred, something
terrible is happening.

I need you to call me back, now.

Oh, for sake, Gwen.

Get some.

Right.

Good morning, Harmburg County.

I'm Rebecca Carpenter,

and here's the latest
on the situation

devastating our community.

According to reports,

people have been
attacked by individuals

infected with some form of
rash and skin discoloration

on their faces and bodies.

Those infected appear to be
attacking anyone within sight.

Police Chief Sarah Booth

urges citizens to comply
with his stay-at-home order.

Until further notice,
streets are to remain closed.

Anyone found outside
of their homes

during this mandatory
stay-at-home order

will be subject to arrest.

This has been signed into
effect by Mayor Robert Miles

and will be in effect
until further notice.

More than 50 people are
confirmed dead this morning

following an outbreak at a
senior assisted living facility.

The virus swept quickly
through the facility

infecting seniors who have
been reacting violently.

Multiple staff members
are among the dead.

We still do not know an origin,

nor do we know why this virus

appears to be
attacking the elderly.

We'll be back in the second
we receive more information

on this tragedy
sweeping the nation.

They're scared.

I
really need to tell Fred

that I fucked his sister, man.

Your weed makes
us the new gods

of the post-apocalyptic world

because of our
enlightened heads.

I
really need to piss, man.

What we have to do
as enlightened beings

is figure out how
to stop these things

and being the special
features fanatic that I am,

I know the number one
way to stop these things

is just shoot 'em in the
head or stab 'em in the head.

How
come I can't talk loud?

Hello?

I'm here to pick up my grandma.

Fuck yeah, man.

Let's do this.

Ah, help me!

Anyway, um, let me know what
time I should come tonight.

I've been trying to get hold
of you and Chad the whole day.

None of you pick up the phone,

so just let me know what
time I should come, okay?

Hey, girl.

No, I, I just called Fred
and left him a message.

I, I can't hear you.

I'll call you back
when I get home, okay?

What the fuck is that?

Nice makeup, bro.

Didn't know it was
Halloween in July.

Oh, you fuckin'!

This
is truly devastating

how we're being lied to
again and not told the truth.

People don't just randomly
attack one another

for no apparent reason.

There's something
else happening here.

If you have any information at
all, please call information.

I will be here all day and
all night with you guys.

Anyone who's out there
listening, I'm here with you.

I have a sword.

Ooh.

Call mom's cell phone.

We're sorry,

you have reached a number
that has been disconnected

or is no longer in service.
Fuck!

Locate dip shit's cell phone.

Locating
dip shit's cell phone.

Location detected at
7th Avenue and J Street.

Please be advised,

some streets may be blocked off

due to an emergency
virus outbreak.

Use caution when
proceeding to destination.

You have an
incoming call from Julie.

What, Julie?

Someone ate Rick!

I don't have time
for this, Julie.

Nobody liked Rick anyways.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Help me!

I have bigger fish to fry.

I have to go save Fred's ass.

Do you mind?

What?

Gotta
go, Julie, bye.

Fucking cunt!

Okay.

Think, think, think.

Uh, okay.

I'm gonna call the cops.

I'm gonna call the fucking cops.

We're sorry-
What?

You have reached a number

that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

Okay.

No, we're gonna call
them back, fuckers.

We're sorry.
Fuck!

Okay.

Okay.

Okay, God, go!

Thanks
for calling Joe's Big Tow.

I need help, please!

Do
you need a tow, ma'am?

No, there's someone
outside eating my boyfriend.

Excuse me?

I need help, please!

You
need to call 911, ma'am.

No, I, all the
lines are blocked.

This is the only call
that went through.

If your car
ain't broken down, ma'am,

then we can't go out
there and get ya.

That's our policy.

Yes.

Okay, fine.

My car is broken down.

Your
car is broken down now?

Yes!

Will you send somebody?

Well, hot
feathers on a duck's, ma'am.

Yeah, we got Hank.

He just got out
from lunch right-

Hello?

Motherfucker!

Hey, hey, hi.

Uh, sir.

Sir, sir.

No.

Sir, no, no.

What are you doing?!

No, stop it.

Stop it.

Fuck.

Okay, this is bad.

Stop, nope, stop.

Hey, hey, sir.

Stop it.

Stop!

Ah, why are you, ah!

No, I, uh.

No, no, no, no, no!

Sir, no, no, no, no.

Stop unlocking the fucking
door, you little cocksucker!

Okay, calm down.

Everybody calm down.

Fuck you, Maddie!

The president has announced
a nationwide lockdown.

Anyone found outside
of their homes

will face arrest and jail time.

The National Guard has
been deployed to the border

to prevent any entry
into the country,

hoping to protect anyone who
could potentially be infected

by this deadly enemy.

We'll be back with
more information

as this story develops,
here, live on GR News.

It's a fortress, man.

I don't see any zombies.

It's our kingdom.

Whoa.

Man, there's a door here, man.

But it doesn't take you to,
doesn't take you to anything.

Um.

Yeah.

Seen it all.

Yeah, they can't
even see us in here.

Whoa, man.

This is a trip.

It's like this door
goes somewhere,

but it doesn't go anywhere.

It's like we're in a
different dimension, man.

It's like that one
space movie, man.

Mike, Mike!
Message.

Mike!

This warning

is for the following area.

states located on
the West Coast-

Oh man.
Of the United States

and surrounding areas.

A viral outbreak has occurred.

It is highly
contagious and lethal.

Please stay in your
homes and do not panic.

This is not a test.

This network is a joke.

Yeah, they pay the
bills, but they suck.

I'm outside right now and
I don't see jack shit.

I'm telling you right now, Todd,

if you can't find
me a new network,

I'm walking from them and
I'm finding a new agent.

That's what you get paid for.

I want to be in the mix.

The open was last month.

I should have been there.

Exactly.

I just want to be on
the better network.

I deserve it.

Thanks.

I'll call you back.

Fuck you!

Could you have someone
come help me jump my car?

It's dead.

Thanks.

Hey, I'm still at the office.

I'm having car trouble.

I'll call you back later.

I don't have time
for this, Eric.

I'll call you back later.

Fucking pussy.

We need weapons, man.

Oh, fuck.

First blood, motherfucker!

Are there arrows in there?

Nope.

Who the fuck has a
bow without arrows?

God, fucking dick heads!

These, man.

You're not gonna
cut their hair, man.

Look around!

Saw, man.

You're, no, you're not Xena.

Come on, dude.

No, put it away.

What about that?

Fuck.

Yeah, this, man.

Yes.

Yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah!

Yeah!
Yeah!

Yeah!

They don't want any more, man.

Fuck Rambo.

Sober motherfucker.

Yo, what the
fuck is that, man?

I can't do this, man.

Hey, uh, skin dick.

Get over here.

God, this was not
such a good fucking-

Fuck is that?

Oh my...

Oh, shit, oh!

Guess who's an alcoholic.
Fuck!

A little help here!

Little help here!

Oh shit.

He's still alive, man.

I've never killed
anybody before, man.

I can't do it.

Don't worry about it.

I learned this from
Edward Norton, mother!

That's what you
get for pushing me!

Oh fuck.

You gotta be heartless, man.

You gotta be heartless
to do the right thing.

Fuck, man.

Oh.

Oh shit, they're
closing in on us, man.

They're everywhere, man!

Oh fuck!

We gotta get the
outta here, man.

We can't fight them all.

Oh, we gotta go!

Let's go!

Dang it!

Fred?

We're sorry-

Fucking kidding me?

That has been disconnected

or is no longer in-

Oh, Fred.

911.

Pick up, Fred.

Pick up, Fred.

This is Fred.

Leave a fucking message.

Oh!

I smell your flesh.

What the fuck?

How can you talk, man?

Of course I can,
you fucking idiot.

How's that even
impossible, man?

It's in the script.

Oh, right.

Oh!

Just let me go, please.

I'll give you all,
all of my Dogecoin.

You fucking idiot!

Oh shit!

You fucking prick!

You kicked me?

Why would you kick me?

I'm a woman.

The fuck?

Hanging out.

Does this look
fucking normal to you?

Fred, stupid cock sucker!

Where the fuck are you, man?

Oh shit!

How am I supposed to eat now?

What the fuck is that, man?

Where's the fucking elevator?

Why you asking me, man?

I don't know where
the elevator is.

You literally said,

I'm totally gonna
remember where this is

in case we have to come
back to this later.

Ah, it's on the way out!

We can find the elevator, man.

Why didn't you
split that last joint?

I don't know, it
helps me think, man.

Supposed to go
to the head one.

No, I didn't, man.

I have ruined my
brain with that,

especially when
I'm fucking high.

You said you were
gonna remember!

All right, man.

I distinctly forgot it

because you said you were
going to remember it.

I'm thinking, I'm
thinking, I'm thinking, man.

All right, so we
went down the hallway

and the zombie chasing
me down that way.

Or we went down the hallway to
the left and we made a right.

When I came back out,
that zombie was chasing me

so it is right...

We made a left, so this
time we go right, right?

Left or right?

Make the decision.

Got it, man.

I got it, man.

I know where it is.

I know where to go.

Follow me.

No other option,
so I guess I have to.

This feels right.
I found it, man.

This is not the elevator.

What, man?

This is an ice cooler from
a fucking convenience store.

How did this even get in here?

Sure, make some more noise.

Make some more noise
so they can find us.

Zombie, over here!

By the icebox!
All right, man,

you made your point.

You're being loud enough.
Fuck.

You really have a
drug problem, man.

Man, you're right.

This could cost
us our lives, okay?

I need an intervention,
I think, man.

Jesus fucking Christ.

Mike, Mike!

What are you doing?

Don't just stand there!

Take your time, man!

I can't move.

Come on, man, this way.

Oh fuck!

What the fuck is that, man?

Fucking hell.

What the fuck is going on?

They're zombies, man.
Fucking zombies.

We're never getting
outta here, man.

We're fucked, dude.

It's inevitable.

What the fuck is that, man?

You okay, grandpa?

There's only one
thing left to do.

He's not moving, man.

He's just like, he's
a statue zombie.

We haven't much time.

Maybe he wants to
smoke some of that, man?

You want some with his, grandpa?

Grandpa, there you go.

Trippy, man.

Smoking
with grandpa zombie.

He likes it, man.

I think we found the cure, man.

Grandpa.

It's our first session
together, grandpa,

A little mind
opening can convert anybody.

He's done.

Oh, he finished
the whole thing, man.

He's done.

Trippy.
No more.

There's no more weed.

Okay, well, that's
the last of it.

That's, that's the last of it?

We don't have any more, man.

He looks like he
wants more, man.

What are we gonna do?

No, man.

Come on, we gotta get outta.

Wait, wait, I think,

I think I got some sprout.

Brussels sprouts, man.
Brussels sprout.

We got some more weed, man.

It's just in
Brussels sprout form.

Good stuff.

Oh fuck, man.

That's right, it
amplifies your hunger.

It also amplifies your
hunger by like 10,000.

Fuck it!

â™ª We're taking no prisoners â™ª

â™ª We're taking family â™ª

â™ª Put that wrench
in his head now â™ª

â™ª Put that zone in my leg â™ª

â™ª Come up with a song with
the sound of the killing â™ª

â™ª Soon we'll be gone
and who will be living â™ª

â™ª Better sing along because
it's time to rally with â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª

â™ª They're all closing in now â™ª

â™ª I'm closing my eye â™ª

â™ª Wading in as they take me â™ª

â™ª I can take them alive â™ª

â™ª Make up a song to the
beat of the beating â™ª

â™ª It's all going wrong
they say sequel of living â™ª

â™ª Smashing their skulls
three fingers were willing â™ª

â™ª But you're sprung in the
air and repeat after me â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª

â™ª Mike and Fred â™ª

â™ª Who gets the dead â™ª
