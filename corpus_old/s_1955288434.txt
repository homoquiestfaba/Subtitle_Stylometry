<i>(Phone dials)</i>

<i>(phone ringing)</i>

<i>(answering machine beeps)</i>

<i>Hey, it's Guy Carter.</i>

<i>I just...</i>
<i>I just wanted to touch base</i>

and let you know
that it was...

it was amazing
meeting you last week.

I felt really good
about it and umm...

I hope you did too.

So...

I look forward
to talking to you soon.

Okay, bye.

<i>(Phone ringing)</i>

<i>(answering machine beeps)</i>

Hey there,
it's Guy Carter again.

Just wondering
if there's any news.

You said I'd hear by Monday
at the latest and...

it's now Friday.

to keep bugging you,

but you basically said
I had the job. (Beep)

Hey, hi, I just...
I was thinking,

if it's easier for you
to text or to e-mail,

that's totally cool.

Hey, it's Guy Carter.
It's Guy Carter, again.

Oh, it's Guy Carter.

I don't want you to lose out
on getting me.

I'm still at the same number.

(female voice on phone) <i>Recording
has been paused due to silence.</i>

Guy:
<i>Okay, now I'm pissed.</i>

<i>How do you not call</i>
<i>someone back</i>

who interviewed
three times

and who you said
was a shoe-in?

How do you not
hire someone

who you said had the best book you'd ever seen?

I deserve this job.

reason you're not calling me back

is because you're
too busy...

chomping on huge dicks.

It's just a big dick
breakfast over there.

Dick omelets
and dick pancakes.

Scrambled dick.
Dick Benedict.

All you can eat dick.
Would you like another mimosa with your dick?

There's a dick
carving station.

You're just grabbing
as much dick.

Oh no, that's okay,
I'm fine with my dick.

Your plate is filled
with dick

and then your mouth
is filled.


In fact, it's
so full of dick,

that I can't pick up the phone
and make a simple--

Man on the phone:
<i>Guy. Rob Veckmann.</i>

<i>The reason</i>
<i>I didn't call you</i>

<i>is because my wife's been</i>
<i>plowing my business partner.</i>

<i>They took over the company</i>
<i>and fired me.</i>

Oh, man.

Oh, that's...
Wow! I had no idea.

Rob: <i>Yeah, there's a lot</i>
<i>you don't know. Dick.</i>

Rob? Rob?


Anne: You alright
in here, chief?

How long have you been
standing there?

Long enough to hear
the dick buffet.

Guy...

you're making
yourself crazy.

How's the crib
coming along?

It's getting there.

You know, not assembling
that thing

isn't gonna stop her
from coming out of me.

Why would I want
to stop her?

Although, I mean,
I guess I wouldn't be totally upset

if she held off
another eight months.

That's funny. I was thinking
if she came sooner,

like say, before Tuesday,

we'd still have health insurance to cover it.

What is that supposed
to mean?

Umm...

Well, pretty much
what it sounds like.

Wait? Are you--
You're serious.

Anne? How are you just
telling me this now?

I don't... You were
so stressed out

I didn't wanna
make it worse.

It looked like the Resource thing was happening,

so I didn't mention it.

But now,
I'm mentioning it.

They have to give you some sort of grace period, right?

They did.
It ends Tuesday.

I mean, I assumed you'd
be working by now.

Yeah. Well, we dropped
the ball on that one.

I'm sorry, "we"?
Meaning me?

You quit your job.

Because we got pregnant.

I can't talk about this
right now.

I'm gonna make tea.

Anne...

<i>¶ To be loved ¶</i>

<i>¶ And to be loved ¶</i>

<i>¶ Forever ¶</i>

<i>¶ Let's make a vow ¶</i>

<i>¶ To never ¶</i>

<i>¶ Ever part ¶</i>

Anne: Here.

What is this?

Anne: I found it
on Craigslist.

It's the only thing
remotely realistic.

Now If you studied
dental hygiene,

that would really open up
our options.

You want me to be
a delivery guy?

I want you to be anything if it
pays the insurance by Tuesday.

That will buy us
another month,

unless of course you want me to call my parents

and ask for more money
again.

It is an option.

No. No, it is not
an option, Anne.

I don't wanna go into labor
and find out the "repo man"

towed my car
out of the driveway.

There's no such thing
as the "repo man."

Of course there is.

Have you ever seen
a repo man...

not counting the Emilio Estevez movie?

Guy, I'm not gonna argue
the existence of repo men

because they're real.

What do they come with,
a tow truck

or a fleet of unicorns?

My half-brother's mom Sandy,

said that she had
her car taken

and I believe it was
by a repo man, okay?

What? They are not...
I might throw up on you.

Guy: You're not gonna
throw up on me.

A little bit.

Why don't you go lie down and I'll bring you something?
Okay?


Go! Go lay down,
I'll bring you something.

Anne: They're real.

<i>(Door creaks)</i>
Guy: Here you go.

For your tummy.

Sorry for being
such a baby.

I know you're frustrated.


It's just so stupid.

I'm supposed to have
my ducks in a row by now.

Maybe it's okay to not
have your ducks in a row.

It's not okay.
Ducks have to be in a row.

Have you ever seen ducks?
They're sorta crazy.

They like to run around,
do shit.

No, I don't...
Not my ducks.

My ducks are different
than your ducks.

Mine are not running
around and crazy.

They have an objective,
they have a plan.

They wanna get
somewhere in life.

Then they're like
walking in a line,

otherwise known
as a row.

Honey, oww.

Then call the number.


(phone ringing)

Man:
<i>Word up?</i>

Oh. Hey. Um...

I'm calling
about your ad.

Man:
<i>You got a car?</i>

Guy: Yes.
Man: <i>Does it run?</i>

Yes.
Man: <i>Meet me at Fat Burger in West Hollywood.</i>

Umm... okay.

Oh, a question...

This may be
a little premature,

but are there benefits?

Man: <i>Plenty.</i>
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

<i>P, L, E, N, T, Y,</i>
<i>my man.</i>

(Doorbell rings)

<i>(Man laughs)</i>
<i>My bad.</i>

<i>Yeah. Um-hm.</i>
<i>What he do?</i>

Scraping the guardrail doesn't
necessarily mean he was wasted.

Oh.
You got me there.

Okay, yeah, no.
I'll tell him,

"No more shootin' up
in the car."

But, fret not, I got a buddy
that will drive you.

Um-hm.
About six foot.

Serious, clean.
Like a cop.

No, he's not a real cop.

I can promise you
he will not hit on you.

How do I know?
'Cause he's gay.

Gay as fuck.

Real gay.

No, he got a sweet ride.

A Volvo.

Yeah, yeah.

Don't get pissy with me.
I'm trying to hook you up.

Sit.

Okay, bye.

You O negative?

No, I'm...

I'm not talking to you.
Uh-huh.

Right.
Are you O negative?

No, I'm-- I'm not talkin' to you.
Hold up.

All right,
I love you too. Bye.

You the one just called?

Yeah, I'm Guy.

I'm Zoley. Congratulations.
You're hired.

Okay... Well,
what am I gonna be driving?

Pizzas?
Dry cleaning? What?

Girls. The first one's
named Nikki.

Huh.

You didn't mention that
in your ad.

It's all above board,
man.

You're not doin'
anything illegal,

you're just drivin'
a car.

Pickin' up, droppin' off.

Easy as cake.

What are the benefits?

Well, you play
your cards right,

there can be
all kinds of benefits.

Know what I'm sayin'?

Guy, you about this life,
or what?

No, no no no...
I'm... Yes... I'm...

I'm about this life.

Okay, all right.
Mm-hmm. Okay, sweet.

Here's where she's at.

Oh, whoa. Now?
You want me to start now?

Right now, yes.
Nikki is waitin'.

And Nikki do not
like to wait.

Hi. I'm Guy.

Guy, with the sweet
ride, Guy?

That'd be me.

Call me Nikki,
Nikki Winters.

And next time,
don't be late.


So where are we going?

Bel-Air.

Female Voice on GPS:
<i>Please proceed to the highlighted route.</i>

Want music?

Smooth jazz is good.

Not what I
would've guessed.

Nikki:
My life's hectic enough.

I don't need
my music to be.

<i>(Jazz music playing)</i>

(car horn beeps)

You realize,
we're still late.

Yeah... I got a ticket
going through a yellow.

So now I just stop.

So about this client,
I've been with him before.

He's a doctor.
Pretty basic.

Just walk me to the door,

and let him know you'll be
outside in the car.

I thought the job was just dropping off and picking up?

"The job" is being
my driver.

That's a ride
and protection.

You carry a weapon?

Me? A weapon?
No, I do not carry a weapon.

What about karate?
You know karate?

I have zero skills
in the lethal arts.

I'm an architect.
I know how to draw.

Never mind, I got my own
protection right here.

Great. I'll let you handle
that part of the operation.

And what about you?

How did you get into this line of work?

Well, it's not exactly
an everyday job.

Well, that depends where
you spend every day.

I grew up
in the Valley.

Every girl I know
did a porno

by the time
she was eighteen.

Or at least
a stripping gig.

But you're still doing it.

Nikki: Yeah,
'cause I'm good at it.

I don't get
what the big deal is.

Nobody asks a carpenter
why they became a carpenter.

Fair enough.


Hello, stranger.

It's been too long.

My driver.
Great house.

Paul Williams?

Paul Williams, right?

He's a pioneer of the California Regency Movement.

Really great designer.

Designed a lot
in the fifties,

which is when it looks this house is from.

He's black, incidentally,
which doesn't really--

I'm sorry.
Do I care about anything you're saying right now?

Nikki:
No, you don't.

Don't you have
somewhere to go?

Yes. He does.

He'll be in the car.
Right, Guy?

Right, of course.
I'll be in the car.

Nikki:
See you in an hour.

(Music playing)

(music continues)

Fuck this.

<i>(Phone ringing)</i>

Anne:
<i>Baby?</i>

So guess what?

<i>I'm not driving pizzas.</i>

What are you driving?

Guy: Hookers.
Anne: <i>Shut up.</i>

I'm serious.

<i>I picked up this lady</i>
<i>called Nikki Winters.</i>

You're fibbing me.
I fib you not.

<i>You know that's not</i>
<i>her real name, right?</i>

No way.
<i>Oh my, God. What was she like?</i>

Was she hot?
Did she have an amazing body?

<i>Did she look like Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman"?</i>

No. This was not
a happy hooker.

This lady was mean.

Mean?
Can you blame her?

I guess not.
<i>So where is she now?</i>

At some doctor's house.

<i>And you're just like sitting out</i>
<i>in the driveway or something?</i>

No, I left.

<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you left?</i>

You just ditched her?

Babe, this guy,
he totally insulted me.

I told him his house
was a Paul Williams,

and he looked at me
like I was an idiot.

<i>I mean, hello,</i>
<i>I have a master's in architecture from Yale,</i>

I think I know what
I'm talking about.

<i>Guy, what if something</i>
<i>happens to her?</i>

Like what? <i>I don't know,</i>
<i>was he creepy?</i>

He hired a hooker to come to
his mansion in the daytime.

Of course he was creepy.

Plus, he's like a doctor.

They're the worst
kind of psychos.

He's her regular.
I'm sure it's fine.

<i>You don't know that.</i>
<i>You have to go back.</i>

Anne, you're crazy talking.
I'm almost home.

<i>If something happens,</i>
<i>you'll never forgive yourself!</i>

<i>Go back now!</i>
<i>This is someone's daughter we're talking about.</i>

Oh! Sorry.

(Car horn honks)
Okay, I see you.

I got... All right!
One sec.

I just gotta U-turn.

Man in car:
<i>Man, move it!</i>

Man in car:
<i>Jesus!</i>

(Phone rings)

Word up?

<i>Hey, it's Guy.</i>

Yeah, you with Nikki?

She's in a house
with a client.

Said she'd be out
twenty minutes ago,

<i>but she's not.</i>

Nikki's never late.

Hold on,
I'll try her cell.

Zoley:
<i>She's not pickin' up.</i>

Damn, that's all I need
is another Nikki problem.

She's, like, fifty percent
of my business.

I lose her, then I'm out
on the street.

Spoken like a true pimp.
<i>Spoken like a true white boy.</i>

There are no more pimps.

Pimps got killed
by Craigslist.

I'm a dispatcher.

<i>I work for Nikki,</i>
<i>not the other way around.</i>

She needs a ride,
she calls me.

If you screw this up,
then she's not gonna call me.

Okay, so what do I do?
Zoley: <i>Lemme think. Lemme think.</i>

You got a gun?
Guy: What? No.

Why does everyone keep
asking if I have a gun?

Calm down, it's
an honest question.

You know karate?
I am an architect!

Zoley: <i>Architects can know karate.</i>

Well, I don't!

You gonna have
to go in, man.

<i>Pretend you're not wearing</i>
<i>a pink shirt and go in!</i>

<i>(Music plays)</i>







Shit!

(Door creaks)

Doctor:
<i>That's right.</i>

<i>Go ahead,</i>
<i>struggle all you want.</i>

<i>(Nikki grunting)</i>

<i>You're not</i>
<i>getting out of this.</i>

<i>You're never</i>
<i>getting out of this.</i>

<i>Helpless right now, huh?</i>
<i>Pretty vulnerable.</i>

(Doctor grunting)
Ah, there we go.

That's too tight.

Nikki:
Hmm-mm.

Hmm-mm.

Huh?



Guy:
Oh shit! Oh, Oh!

Shit, shit,
shit, shit.

Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

I'm here. I'm here.
I'm sorry.

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

What do you mean?
He was torturing you.

That was role play,
you dumbass. What?

I was teaching him
how to tie bondage knots.

He pays extra if I let him wear the dog mask.

Or at least, he was gonna.
Just untie me, okay?

Uh... Jesus. How?

How do you...
Oh, my God!

Is this guy a fucking
Eagle Scout?

Hold on. I took
sailing camp one summer

and I think this is a...
What do you call this knot?

Are you fucking kidding me?
Sorry.

Let me, okay, hold on.

It's like
a spaghetti factory.

I don't even know
where to begin.

Under.
Under what?

Under, over.
Under.

Under, over, yeah.

Pretty simple.
Yeah.

I think I got it,
I think I got it!

Got it, got it,
got it, got it, got it.

Got it. Is that good?
Is that good?

Okay. Phew!
Yes!

Yeah, that's it.
I knew it!

I knew it.

Idiot!
Oww!

Guy: Shit!

Nikki:
<i>Here, put this in a case.</i>

Jesus! What the hell
is wrong with you people?

Does this go
a certain way?

Now look, I still
gotta get paid,

but I'm gonna give you
half price.


Oh, and good work today.

Oww! Fuck!

Guy, come on.
Sorry. Yeah.

Got it.
Got it. Got it.

Nikki: <i>Guy, come on!</i>
Fucking got it!

Son of a...

Nikki: I can't fucking
believe this.

<i>(Music playing)</i>

You think this
was my fault?

Whose fault was it?
You said an hour!

Yeah, well, he was stuck
on the Bachmann hitch.

That's a really hard knot.

The rabbit has to go
around the tree three times

before he goes
down the hole.

You know what,
if I'm gonna be late, I usually text

but you said you were
sticking to the driving

and I was handling
the protection,

which there was
no need for,

until you decided
there was.

I cannot believe that this is my life right now.

We committed a crime, Nikki.
An actual crime.

I broke and entered.
I assaulted.

What if he's dead?
What if I just murdered a doctor?

Don't flatter yourself.
It's a bump on the head at best.

What if he calls
the cops?

Trust me,
the doc is not gonna tell anyone about this.

Besides him,
I'm the only one that knows

about your retarded
heroics.

Suffice to say,

I'm not payin' your percentage on that stop.

My percentage?
You get 20 % of the take.

What "take"?

Everything we make,
you get 20 % of.

How do you
not know this?

I don't know,
I guess...

everything happened
so fast,

I forgot to ask
about the money.

Never forget
to ask about the money.

How much, exactly,
are we talking about?

Saturday night,
a couple of stops...

Plus the two girls
we're picking up

for the bachelor party...

All in, you could walk away
with a grand, maybe two.

Two... Two thousand... dollars?

$2,000?

Just to be clear,
I'm not doin' you any favors.

You're gonna earn it.

<i>(Music playing)</i>

<i>(music continues)</i>

Nikki:
Grab my bag.

Ladies, shake a leg.

Hey, make yourself at home,
why don't you?

I always do.
Where's Jaxi?

Gettin' dolled up.

Who's he?

Hi, I'm Guy.
I'm new.

Nick, what the eff?

(Dog whimpering)

Most people do that
in the shower.

I'm not most people.

This is a huge night.
We can't be breaking in a new dude.

Zip it, okay?
He's got a sweet ride. A Volvo.

This him?
Nikki: Uh-huh.

Hi. I'm Guy.

He don't look like
no driver.

Look, we have a party
in the penthouse at The Teal.

We need a guy
who's on point.

He's up for it, okay?

To prove it,
he's gonna wash the hardware.


Nikki: <i>Right, Guy?</i>
Jaxi: Oh shit!

That'll be fun.
They've been cooking.

Guy: Is it-- Oh!
Jaxi: Scrub-a-dub-dub.

<i>It's leaking. (Laughs)</i>

<i>I mean, you're the reason</i>
<i>I'm here at all.</i>

<i>Remember,</i>

Yeah, well it seems
like everyone's

I gotta clean

<i>I'll talk to you</i>

Okay.
Good to go.

You missed a spot.

What, I scrubbed

Oh, God.

Ugh, get it off.

I was numb for a week.

Numb, but minty fresh.

Bitch. I am always minty fresh.
I'd like you fucking--

Hey, our driver doesn't want to hear your gory details.

Oh, no,
don't mind me.

Fallon:
We won't.

Uh, that's...

that's an open container
right there.

Yeah, sure is.

How else do you
get the liquid out, huh?

Yeah, well...

I don't really think
that's a good idea

to have in the car.

Right?
I mean, lots of cops.

(Fallon giggling)
What's with this guy?

Tell me he's not for real?
Please tell me.

I'm sorry, but...

do you want us to buckle our seat
belts back here too, grandpa?

'Cause we can.

You know what?
Go easy on him.

He's sensitive... I mean,
being a gay and all.

Oh, you like boys?

Oh my God,
that's so cute!

We never had
a homo driver before.

No wonder he took so long

Umm... in terms of extras

how does that work?

Uh...

We can discuss that I'm sure.

Awesome, dude.
Awesome.

Yeah, man.

How long has it been,

Uh...
I guess Grad school.

Wow! That is like

No, wow.
You made partner.

Wow, that's... Congratulations.
That's amazing.

It's rad.

Not only is everything
fucking free now,

They watch it over
and over and over.

You guys done with the grass-is-greener shit?

We gotta bring Guy
up to speed.

You ready for your fifteen minutes,
Big Daddy?

Uh...
I'm not sure I follow.

They think
you're a pimp, right?

I thought there were no more
pimps because of Craigslist?

There aren't.
But those fools out there don't know that.

So run with it.

Act like
you're Willie Dynamite,

been beating chicks
down for years.

That way they feel sorry
for us and they tip harder.

How many ones
you got?

A hundred.

Here's what
we're gonna do.

Sell 'em, collect 'em again,
sell 'em again.

If they're not sticky
by night's end,

you didn't turn
'em around enough.

And collect the panties,
'cause they'll steal 'em and that shit's costly.

Amen. The most important thing,
learn your script.

What, I have
to read this?

Nikki: <i>You have to perform it.</i>
<i>You're a pimp, remember?</i>

You gotta bring out
that big boss, Mac Daddy,

fur-coat-wearin'
motherfucker

that I know is in you.

Jaxi:
Bring it out, boo-boo.

Okay, no.

Fallon: What?
Jaxi: No?

Guy: No, no, no, no,

I...

I can't do this.

Fallon:
Are you kidding?

I can't do this.

There are people
out there that I...

I'm sorry.

I thought I was gonna be delivering pizzas tonight.

Honestly.

I'm in way over
my head here.

I... I...

This...

I understand, Guy.

What?

You do?
Yeah, 'cause it's...

Thank you.
We get it.

Thank you.

Because this...
is just not me.

But, I'll pay for your cab,
it's only fair.

Nikki:
We got it, Guy.

One thing, though.
You got a long drive.

Might wanna visit the little boys room, first.

Smart thinking.

I do kind of have to go.
So, excuse me.

Mm mm mm.

Who said,
"Don't break a guy in on a Saturday night?"

Who said it?

Get your gear on
and shut your faces.

Oh, sorry,
it's all yours.

I'm not here
for the bathroom.

So, you goin' home
to your boyfriend?

Huh?

You're still gay, right?

Oh, yeah.
I'm gay. See?

Pink shirt. I'm gay.

So...

you don't like it
when I do this?

Um... not really.

Or this...?
(Zipper zips)

No.

Or this?

Umm...

(camera clicks)

Homos don't pop boners
when girls touch them.

You know who does?
Husbands.

Look, can I have
my phone, please?

Is this
your "boyfriend"?

That's Anne.
That is my wife.

I wonder what Anne
would think of this?

Let's see, contacts.
Anne Carter.

"Attaching file"...

Okay, Nikki...
Nikki...

Please... please.

She's 37 weeks pregnant.

She's very
fragile right now.

She will not understand this,
not in a million years.

I'm sure she wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

I mean, nobody likes
a cheater.

Okay, please,
Anne will leave me.

She will leave me,
okay?

You don't understand
the stress we're under,

both of us out of work.

Oh, cry me a river,
Volvo Guy.

Yeah, things sound
really desperate,

with you turning your back
on an easy grand.

I... I told you,

I can't do this job.

It's too much for me.

Everything's just...

It's too much for me.

I got two words
for you, mister:

Buck the hell up.

Now, I'm gonna
keep hold of this.

And you're gonna
learn these...

and get
your non-gay-ass

into that room and you're gonna do your job.

Okay?

He was un-cool with it.
Now he's cool with it.

Let's go, let's go.
Lets' go.

Bring them out!

Bring them out!
Bring them out!

Bring them out!
(Crowd applauding)

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Guy: <i>All right. Shit.</i>

Man: <i>That shirt is so pink.</i>

Hi.
(Feedback squeals)

Hello. Hi.
Okay, okay.

Sit down.
Man: <i>Come on, get on with it.</i>

You want me to bring
the ladies out...

we gotta learn
a few basic rules.


Bullshit!

First and foremost,
no kissing the ladies on the mouth.

They don't like it.


It's alright, it's...
Man: <i>Can I kiss you?</i>

That's what it says.
Second rule...

Man:
<i>Take off your top!</i>

No fingers
in any holes.


That's a deal breaker.

That also goes
for remote controls.

Cheese doodles.
Action figures. Action figures?

Man: <i>Is my dick an action figure?</i>

Anything other than a sanctioned toy goes in the holes,

show's over.


One last thing.

You want a hot show,
you're gonna have to tip.

Man:
I'll show you my tip.

I'll be selling
ones all night, all right?

So, anyone?


Man:
<i>Fuck yeah!</i>

Guy: <i>Put your hands together</i>

<i>for the owner</i>
<i>and founder</i>

of "Bad Gurls"
party services,

Miss Nikki Winters

and her BFFs
Jaxi and Fallon!

(Rock music playing)

Take it off!

Yeah!


<i>(music continues)</i>

<i>(men booing)</i>

Man: <i>Work that!</i>
<i>Shake it out right!</i>


Good work, Guy.
You get your phone back.

Thanks.

Jaxi:
You like that, Daddy?

There you go.
Um-hmm. Yeah.

I'll take that.

Hey, bullshit on that shit!

Your chick just
lifted all my ones!

That's fuckin'
unacceptable.

That's how you run
your business, bro?

No, no, no!
I'm sorry.

I'll get your ones back.

Watch and learn.

Oh yeah! Oh!

(Men cheering)

<i>(man chanting)</i>

Jaxi:
Make it rain, baby!

Hi, Daddy!

(Phone ringing)

Jaxi: <i>You like that?</i>
<i>Give me more.</i>

Hello?
Jaxi: <i>I'll keep giving you more.</i>

Anne. Hold on,
hold on.

Hon. Everything okay?

What? Wait. Now?

That's impossible.
You're still three weeks away.



Holy Christ. Okay.
Well, uh...

What should we do?
What do you want me to do?

Okay, I'll be there.


Ow! Hey, it really hurts.

Nikki:
It's supposed to.

Guy: Nikki, Nikki, Nikki,
I gotta talk to you.

I'm kinda in the middle
of something.

Guy:
It's an emergency. Please?

Nikki:
Go to town.

Man:
<i>His ass is bleeding, dude!</i>

It actually really hurts.

Nikki:
What's the problem?

I gotta go.

Haven't we been through
this already tonight?

This is different.
I'm having a family crisis.

Yeah, well, You leave,
I'm having a financial crisis, okay?

Party games are up next.
You really wanna miss all the fun?

No, no,
but-- Yeah, we're gonna put licorice up our pussies,

and they're gonna
eat it out.

Then we pour tequila shots
in our pussies

and they drink it out.

Oh, then we put whipped cream
in our pussies

and they lick--

I get it, I get it.
Lots of stuff going into the...

Fallon: <i>That's what we do.</i>
Guy: ...pussies.

Yeah, I need you here
to cut the deals,

keep the supplies coming

tequila, candy,
whipped cream...

Nikki,
my wife just called.

She's having the baby.

Are you fucking with me?

I wish I were.

Fine.
Go have your damn infant.

Just don't expect
to get paid.

Jaxi: <i>'Cause you didn't do shit!</i>

I don't.
It's... I don't.

Bye, loser.

Jaxi:
I thought he was gay.

(Tires screeching)

Sorry.

Hi. Maternity?

Sorry.

Hi. What's happening?

Baby,
this is Doctor Siegel.

This is my husband, Guy.

Hi. Is it coming out?

Uh... It is,
but not today.

He says
I'm not even dilated.

But okay--
What about the pain?

Well, your wife was
experiencing false labor.

Which is not uncommon
during the first pregnancy.

Could be brought on
by anything really.

Dehydration, stress...

We started a saline drip just
to kind of settle things down.

I'm already
feeling better.

Oh, thank God.

Oh, thank God.
I cannot have this kid yet.

Well, she is coming out
sooner or later.

I'm gonna go make a note
in your chart.

I'll be back in a bit
to take that drip out.

Anne:
<i>Thank you.</i>

You know, it really hurts
my feelings

when you say things
like that.

Oh.

I don't mean to upset you.
I'm just...

I'm just being honest.

I'm not ready.

<i>What if I just suck</i>
<i>at being a dad? Really.</i>

What if I'm
a bad provider,

financially and emotionally?

I mean,
think about it, Annie.

We are bringing
an actual human,

a real human life
into this world.

She's gonna be a person.

And everything that
she is and is going to be

depends upon us.

<i>What made us think</i>
<i>we could do that?</i>

<i>What if we're not</i>
<i>up to the job?</i>

I just spent two hours
with three women whose parents

clearly did something wrong
because there's no way

a well-adjusted person

would stick licorice rope
up their-

Licorice rope?
I love Licorice rope.

Yeah, me too.
I was just saying how I wish I had some.

Can't help ya there,
but you're lucky

you got a doctor
with a sweet tooth.

Would you care
for a Fruit Burst?

No, thank you.

Baby, what if you're
right?

What if she hates us?

Why wouldn't she?
I hate my parents.

You do not hate
your parents.

Well, I do. I mean,
I don't totally love my parents.

I wouldn't choose
to hang out with them.

What if she feels
about me

the way that I feel
about my mom?

Oh, my God.

I'd kill myself.

Sign here, and here...

Pay that much now,

and then mail this form
into the insurance

to get
your reimbursement.

If we still have
insurance by then.

Man.

That's about how much
Nikki said I'd make tonight.

What, the hookers?

Yeah, there was a lotta money
flying around.

But I'm done.
Thank you.

Come on. Let's get you
home and into bed.

You should probably
come with me.

No, I don't want to leave my car here.
I'll drive.

Are you sure?
I'll meet you there.

You sure? You sure?

I love you.
I love you.

All right,
I'll meet you at home.

Ma'am, is there a water fountain around here?

Right around the corner
to the right.

Thank you.


You?

You.


Orderly: Doctor?
Doctor Kurtz?

Yes.

Is he...?
Is that a patient?

Hey... Code Grey!
Code Grey!

Oh shit.

<i>(Chattering on PA system)</i>

Woman on PA System:
<i>Dr. Grey, Dr. Grey. North wing.</i>

<i>Dr. Grey, Dr. Grey.</i>
<i>North wing.</i>

<i>(Door creaks)</i>

Guy: Oh jeez!
Kurtz: Shh.

I just filled this syringe

with 1.1 milliliters
of Anectine.

Enough to paralyze you
for several hours.

It's a very disagreeable
experience.

Whatta you say
we go look up Nikki, huh?

Okay.

Come on.

<i>(Jazz music playing)</i>

What are you planning
on doing to her?

I don't know yet.

You're really starting to sound like a creepy doctor,
you know that?

Yeah. You know what?
Just keep driving.

What happened
wasn't her fault.

It was mine.

I'm new to this.
I thought she was being tortured.

I pay extra for that.

I know that now,

but I think you can appreciate
the misunderstanding.

I mean, If you heard what I heard...
it sounded pretty extreme.

Obviously,
you have issues.

Maybe you should
consider therapy?

Or you might want to rethink
the missionary position.

It still works.

Rather well,
as a matter of fact.

And it leaves s lot
less room for confusion.

Shut the fuck up.

I don't think you realize
how lucky you are.

You're a doctor.

You're getting to do,
what I imagine,

you've always wanted
to do--

and getting
paid for it.

Do you know
how rare that is?

Most people work
their whole lives

and never get
that chance.

You go in there
half-cocked,

you're throwing it
all away.

Your medical license?
Gone.

And for what?

Go! Go! Go!

Another thing, doctor,
I Googled your house.

It is a Paul Williams.
1953.

Preservation boards
go crazy for him

because he was black,
working in an all-white hierarchy.

Guy: You could get
landmark status.

Are you
fucking kidding me?

Guy:
Nikki. Shit.

Guy: Nikki, don't move.

Doctor, please don't.

Listen to me, think about it.
Think about all of it.

You get landmark status.

Which, on your house,
means no property taxes!

That's huge
cash savings.

(All groaning)


Holy shit!

Why the fuck did
you bring him here?

What? I...

Did you not just see...?

He kidnapped me!

Dr. Fucking Strangelove
works at our hospital.

He was hell bent on getting revenge or something.

Nikki: <i>I guess he's</i>
<i>shit outta luck.</i>

Guy:
Yeah, it looks that way.

I hope to fuck
he's not dead.

No, he's just paralyzed
for a couple of hours.

It's a...

Thing. It's a neck...
Whatever.

Awesome. So what's
the deal with your baby?

False alarm.

Well, since you're here,
want your old job back?

Come on, doc.
I got you.

Look what the cat
dragged in.

Hey! Now the party's
gonna get really crazy!

Pull up a bottle, "driver."
We're in the home stretch.

Hey, can you
hook that for me, Love?

Oh, yeah.

That's not one of the regular Kiss guys,
is it?

No, it's Eric Carr.
He's the best.

He replaced Peter Criss
on the drums.

Guy: <i>Good to know.</i>
Yeah, he's a fox.

How can you tell?
He's got paint all over his face.

No, I mean, literally.

He's a fox, like,
that's his character.

Her mom
slept with him once.

That's Fallon's
big claim to fame,

she could have been
the Kiss drummer's daughter.

Nikki: Okay, this is it.
The big finale.

We're lookin' to get five bills.
It's up to you.

At this point,
there's pretty much nothing that'll shock me.

Except this.

We're looking to get every single mother fuckin' dollar.

Fallon: Yeah.
Work it down to the bone.


I'm ticklish.
Balls out.

Man:
This guy?

All right, everybody.

Guy:
Alright, alright.

(Crowd jeering)

Listen, this is the moment
you've all been waiting for.

(Crowd cheering)

It's time
for the girl-on-girl...

on-girl sex show.

Now, now listen,

this is one hot, sick show.

Everything you see
is real.

I'm serious. Everything.
One hundred percent.

None of it is fake.
Listen, listen...

(crowd shouting)

All right, all right.
Stop it!

Guy: You want proof?
Man: <i>Bullshit!</i>

Our girl Fallon,
she's gonna prove it.

There's no way to fake
what she's about to do.

Guy:
Okay, it is the real deal.

Now I don't wanna ruin
the surprise

but suffice to say,

you might not
wanna sit too close.

(Crowd gasps)

I need to see the money.
Help me out.

'Cause I can't-- We can't go forward without the money!

So what do you say?
How about some money?

(Crowd cheering)

You guys are very smart.

'Cause you just bought
yourself a memory

that you will
never ever forget. Boom.

<i>(Music playing)</i>


What I tell you?

Woo!

(Phone ringing)

Anne: <i>Where'd you go?</i>
<i>I thought you were right behind me?</i>

Guy: I got sidelined.
Anne: <i>By what?</i>

It's a long story,
try not to be mad,

but, I'm back at the hotel.

Now you've got me
thinking about this baby.

What if I hate her?
What if she's ugly?

What if she has one of those giant raspberry birthmarks

on her face and I can't
bond with her

because I can't
even look at her?

<i>What if I hate her</i>
<i>because she's beautiful,</i>

more beautiful than I am?

And I get super jealous
of her and resentful

<i>and competitive because</i>
<i>she has six pack abs...</i>

Nikki:
<i>Guy, come on.</i>

While I bust my ass
at CrossFit every week

and still have this weird
an inner tube around my waist?

Oh, my God, Guy,
I feel the postpartum already setting in.

<i>Does California have a law</i>

<i>where you can drop off</i>
<i>a baby at a fire station--</i>

Babe, babe, babe, babe.
You're spinning.

I know! That's why I need
you to come home right now!

The party isn't over yet.

We need to clean up
and get these girls home.

<i>Look, just try to relax.</i>

Try to lay down.
Lay down and make some chamomile tea.

Guy: <i>Just calm--</i>

Anne: I can't calm down!

You know why,
because I don't have a "me"

to calm me down
like I do for you!

The one time
I need a "me,"

<i>you're not here!</i>
<i>(Phone clicks)</i>

<i>(Fallon moaning)</i>
Babe? Babe?


(moaning continues)

Fallon:
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

(Crowd chanting)
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

Crowd:
Oh!

Oh, my God!
That's so wrong!

<i>(Men chattering)</i>

Go clean yourself up.

What is that stuff?

Nobody knows.
But you should clean it off.


I think I'm in love.

Oh, shit.

We got robbed.

Robbed?

As in, someone came in here

and snaked all our cash.

Wait, are you sure?

This was full.
Now it's not.

Who would do something
like that?

One of those
limp dick fuck boys.

You killed yourselves
for that money!

I wouldn't go
that far, but, yeah,

it took some effort.

Hold on, wait.

Maybe-- Maybe-- Maybe it like just fell out or something.

It didn't.

Well, we should at least have look around for it,
don't you think?

I agree.
Let's look for it.

Fallon: Mother fuckers! Jaxi: Yeah,
somebody's about to get fucked up.

It's not under here.

Wait! Ladies.

Hey, party's
goin' great, man.

That show was a mind fuck.
Yeah, sure was.

We gotta talk about that thing we were talkin' about.
The extras?

Yeah, that's not
happening right now.

What the fuck?

You said we'd get extras.

You gave me your word.

We got robbed,
motherfucker.

Either you make up
the difference

or we don't let
anyone outta here.

You're high.

None of these guys
would rob you.

They're all agents.

Suit yourselves.

Ladies, lock the doors.

This is ridiculous.
I'm calling security.

No, you ain't.

Uh-oh.
Shit just got real.

Wha-- Nikki, whoa.
Nikki...

you never
mentioned guns.

I thought we
were gonna talk.

We are gonna talk.

This helps them listen.

Okay, people.
We got a situation here.

One of you boners
stole my money.

Nobody is leaving
this fucking hotel

until I get it back.

I want all of you cunts
on the carpet.

Now!

Jaxi: <i>Yeah,
who's taking their dicks out now, bitch?</i>

He gets a pass.

You can take whatever I got.

Take my wallet.
Take anything.

I don't want your wallet, prick.
I want my money.

The money I earned.

Fallon:
Yeah, the money we earned.

Nikki:
Guy, check 'em.

Check 'em.

Aren't you two cozy.

Fucking guys spooning.

Jaxi: <i>This one's clean.</i>
Fallon: <i>This guy's clean.</i>

Clean. Move!

Guy: Clean here.
Fallon: Ooh, library card.

Guy: Clean.
Fallon: Munch some carpet!

I touched his penis.
Sorry. Clean.

Jaxi: <i>Clean.</i>
Nikki: <i>Check his pants.</i>

Help!
Congratulations, dude.

Man: Thank you.
Guy: Sorry. Clean.

What about him?

Hey, you don't
have to worry about me.

I mean,
you know I'm cool.

Jaxi: <i>Clean.</i>
Fallon: <i>Clean.</i>

Hey, man.
I got laid off six months ago.

I had to do it.
I'll split it with you.

Nikki: <i>I know one of you</i>
<i>boners stole this shit!</i>

Come on, man,
help out a bro.

It's this one.
<i>(Roars)</i>

You dick!

We got a runner!
Get him!


<i>(music playing)</i>

Fallon:
Go! Go! Go!

Move your ass, Guy.

Jaxi:
Elevator's not coming, bitch!

Fallon:
Get over here, fucker!

Stop right there!

Jaxi:
<i>Please jump.</i>

Hey...

Make my fucking night.

Oh, I was just messin'
with you guys.

I was totally
gonna give it back.

You idiot.

It's right here.
Every cent.

Frisk his ass.

That's just...
Hey.

Homeboy is
doughy as fuck.

Look here.
I forgot about that. Sorry.

Okay, I told you,
I was gonna give it back.

I was just
bustin' your balls.

Turn around
and get on your knees.

What?
On your knees, fuck-tard!

Jaxi:
You like to play games, right?

What're you gonna do, Guy?
Someone's about to get fucked up.

Guy, buddy, please, please,
don't let them hurt me, please.

I'm so sorry!

I'm so, so, so, so sorry!
Please...

Guy: Nikki, Nikki...
Hey, listen.

Ladies...
piss on this fucker.

Devon: What?
Fallon: Hell yeah!

Nikki, hold on,
that's just plain gross.

You cannot pee-pee on me!
Guy, don't let them do this!

Honey, my bladder's about to burst.
(Zipper scratches)

Nikki: Do you wanna
go first, or should I?

You filthy bitches!

No, don't don't don't!
Seriously, stop. Don't...

Yeah, pee on him.

Devon:
Oh God, stop. No!

Nikki:
Rainbow kiss!

(Devon groaning)

Devon:
It's in my mouth!

Fallon, what the fuck
are you doing?

You said pee on him.

He's blindfolded.

He can't tell
the difference!

Well,
I really had to go.

Devon:
You nasty, filthy bitches!

Wait. Why does she get
to pee on him and I don't?

Fallon: Give it back to me,
motherfucker!

Jaxi:
Bitch!

Jaxi:
Smells like asparagus.

Hey, man.

Good thing she didn't
have to poop, huh?

What?

(Sirens whirr)

Having fun yet?

Is this what every
Saturday night is like?

Pretty much.

How do you survive?

Smooth jazz helps.

I think I might need
something stronger.

Smooth metal.

Why are you
such a stress case?

Oh, I don't know.

Because I'm about
to have a kid.

I don't have a career.

Your kid doesn't
need you to have a career.

Really?
What does she need?

For you to basically do what
you've been doing tonight with us.

I think you and I have very different philosophies

on how to raise kids.

I don't know.

No, I think it boils down
to a ride and protection.

Sure you can throw in
washing their stuff

and picking up after them,

which, incidentally,
you also did tonight.

But mostly,

kids just need a ride
and protection.

It doesn't matter if you drive a Porsche or a Pontiac.

As long as the kid knows that
you're gonna be there on time

and they're
gonna be safe,

it's a job done.

We both know
you can do that.

You can do that
like a champ.

Now, look...

Now before we clear out
of the room,

do an idiot check.
Come on.

Hey, ladies, hold up.

I've got
something of yours.

Oh my God,
these are my favorites.

Someone was supposed
to collect all the panties.

Man:
They were under the couch.

I'm just glad I was able
to get 'em back to you.

Well, thanks.

Man: It really was
a dynamite show.

I'd also like to say

I'm sorry for what
happened back there.

Some guys...

they just don't
say a lot

for the male gender,
now do they?

Yeah, well, if it wasn't
for the male gender,

we wouldn't have jobs.

True, which leads me
to my next point.

Now, I know you said
you guys were done...

Here we go.

Dude, go home.

Bust a load off
in your sink.

I got two hundies burnin'
a hole in my pocket.

My truck is
right in the corner,

so, what do ya say?

What the hell.
Awesome.

This will just take
a few seconds, no offense.

Come on.

Some taken.
But... yeah. Shall we?

My cousin made over a million bucks selling vitamins.

Fallon:
Maybe coke vitamins.

No, bitch.
Real fucking vitamins.

Nu-uh.
Yeah-huh.

Fallon: Okay, that was
so black-ish of you.

Jaxi: <i>Bitch, I am black.</i>
<i>Stop fucking playing with me like that, Fallon.</i>

So is she gonna go all the way with that guy,
right over there?

Jaxi:
What're you, 12?

I'm just sayin'.

Oh, he's worried.

You worried
about her, pops?

Well, when you actually think about it,
it is worrisome.

Jaxi: <i>Okay, here's</i>
<i>what they don't teach you</i>

<i>when you buy a ticket</i>
<i>at the door.</i>

Pros, do the
absolute minimum.

That means, we dance
a little, talk dirty...

Finger ourselves.
Maybe a hand job.

If he can get it up, which,
more than likely, he can't.

Exactly.
These guys are so full of vodka and whatnot,

it's mostly babysitting.

That's why
they call it a trick.

Professionals,
rarely, if ever,

give up the cookie.

No fucking way. Oh, my God,
this cannot be fucking happening.

What's not happening?
Fallon: The guy from the party. He's busting Nikki!

He's a fucking cop,
we gotta get out of here.

Yeah, yeah.
Guy, drive!

What about Nikki?

Nikki's going to jail
right now,

which is not where
we're goin',

so you need to drive
this fucking car

before I do it for you.

We can't leave.
What 'cause of Nikki?

Fucking drive the car!
Back the fuck up!

Fallon:
Let's go!

Jaxi: <i>What the fuck?</i>
Fallon: <i>What're you doin'?</i>

Fallon:
Come on, dude.

Jaxi: <i>What the fuck?</i>
Fallon: <i>Why are you stopping?</i>

Jaxi: <i>What are you doing?</i>
Fallon: <i>Keep going!</i>

Jaxi: <i>Drive forward!</i>
<i>What the fuck?</i>

Fallon:
<i>Press the fucking pedal!</i>

(Tires screeching)

Man:
Whoa, hey!

Go! Go! Go!


Hey!


Fuck!
You did not just do that!

What the fuck,
Tokyo Drift?

I don't see 'em
in the back.

Jaxi: That's because
there's nobody behind us.

Tokyo Drift,
you did it!


(all groaning)

Oh, fuck!

Ah...
Is everyone okay?

Not really.

What happened?

We're fucked.

Fallon: Oh my God, you guys,
jail fucking sucks.

Jaxi: But on a Saturday night,
jail sucks donkey dick.

Hold on. Stop it.
No one's going to jail.

Guy.
Unless you can fly...

Come on, come on.
Let's go!

<i>(Siren whirrs)</i>

All right.
Guys, come on.

Nikki:
Even if you leave the car,

they're still gonna
arrest you at home.

But they're not gonna arrest you.
Come on!

Jaxi:
Down the alley. Go!

Officer: <i>Adam 12 to dispatch of
the 29th alleyway of 3rd and 4th...</i>

<i>we're requesting</i>
<i>additional units, over.</i>

Officer 2:
Let's head 'em off at Temple.

Let's move, let's move

(siren whirrs)

Jaxi: Come on!
Hey, wait for the white people!

Jaxi:
Oh, watch out for that.

Hey, hey, hey!

<i>(Siren whirrs)</i>

Nikki:
We lost them.

Jaxi: Who are the baddest
bitches on the planet?

We are!
Nobody's fucking with us!

I'd hug you right now...
if I had arms.

I guess I got
a little carried away.

Just a teeny tiny.

(Jaxi laughs)

Hey, do you have
a bobby pin?

Sparkly or regular?

Fallon!

Jeez.
Give it here.

Jaxi:
<i>Wake your ass up, ho.</i>

Fallon:
<i>Huh?</i>

This is my souvenir.

Wait. Aren't you
forgetting something?

Oh yeah. My money.

For such a bad night,
it was actually pretty good.

We have Guy
to thank for this.

You rocked harder
than Eric Carr.

The Fox.

You're
a stand-up guy, Guy.

Hey, you too. Well...

I get it.

I gotta get
this one to bed.

Bye, guys.

Guy, you can
drive me any time.

As soon as I get
out of jail.

Fallon:
Ahh, hold me.

(Dog barking)

You're taking
the dog out.

Nikki:
Can you wait a bit?

Guy: It'll just be a sec,
I gotta take her bags up.

Nikki: Well, actually,
it might be more than a sec.

I wanna show you
something.

After all you've done,
you deserve a reward.

(Door creaks)

Can I get you a drink?

Ahh...
No, thank you, I'm good.

I'll be right back.

Guy:
Wow.

This is an impressive
amount of tea pots here.

Nikki: <i>Thanks.
Yeah, I've been collecting 'em forever.</i>

<i>They're mostly vintage.</i>

<i>I'm really into animal ones.</i>

<i>I've gotten some</i>
<i>sick deals on eBay.</i>

<i>See that elephant one</i>
<i>with the pink flower?</i>

<i>Guess how much</i>
<i>I paid for that?</i>

Uh, fifteen dollars?

Ninety-nine cents.
Plus shipping.

You can't beat that
with a stick.

Wow. No, that is a sick deal.

Wow, yeah...
Your place is...

very tastefully done.

<i>(Jazz music playing)</i>

I'm glad you're
noticing these things.

It's good, considering
why I brought you here.

I want to show you
something.

Something very personal.

Nikki:
It's mine, that land.

The only thing
it's missing is a house.

A tasteful house.

You realize,
building a house from the ground up

is incredibly expensive.

I mean, it could be hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

Guy, what do you
know about me?

Not much.

What's one thing
you do know?

You like money?

And do you think I spend it,
or save it?

Save it?

And if I've been
saving for eleven years,

how much
do you think I have?

A lot?

Try a fuck of a lot.

So when can I see
those drawings?

Next week. Definitely.

I expect a friends
and family discount.

Yeah, without a doubt.

Let me give you
my lawyer's details.

Have your wife call as soon as the police arrest you.

Tell her
Patricia referred you.

That's your real name?
Patricia?

Patricia Cornbluth.

Now beat it.
I need my beauty sleep.

Thank you.
Patricia...

Guy:
<i>Cornbluth.</i>

Nikki:
Oh, and, Guy?

When you come back
with those drawings...

these will be
waiting for you.

I can't wait.

You came back.

Anne...

I am so sorry that I got us into this mess,

but Nikki...

she has this lawyer who will handle the entire thing,

and she might not charge us,
as a favor to Nikki.

I think if
I go peacefully,

maybe they won't
come down too hard on me.

What are you
talking about?

Weren't... they here?
The police?

No.

Did they call?

No, Guy, no police
have come or called.

What the hell
is going on?

Maybe I dreamt
the whole thing.

Anne: <i>Are you</i>
<i>in some kind of trouble?</i>

Maybe not.

I'm glad you're back.

I didn't think you were coming
back after my mini meltdown.

You're allowed
to have a meltdown.

Of course
I was coming back.

How else was I gonna be
able to give you this?

What did you have to do
to get all this?

You don't wanna know.

Actually, I do.

Okay.
I'll tell you everything.

Because...
Because the police

are probably going
to come here and take me away.

So, umm...
What?

But I want you
to know that...

I don't care anymore
about ducks being in a row.

I don't.

Ducks be damned.

As long as I have you
and our daughter...

Ducks can go
fuck themselves.

I don't think that
would be a good idea.

Then there'd just be
more to take care of.

Is that...
is that a siren?

No. That is
the John Lennon mobile

I attached to the crib.

I assembled it myself...

and a few other things.

(Siren whirrs)

Isn't this that Volvo
we were lookin' for.

It is that Volvo
we were lookin' for.

Motherfucker's behind
on like, six payments.


Let's go repo that shit.

Yeah.
Yeah.
