(chuckles)
Man: Toby?

I could use your help
in the garage.


Come on, for old time's sake.
Dad, Dad, I'm busy.

When you're done,
come out, okay?

Toby:
Yup.


(clears throat)

(shouting and grunting)



No, no, no, no, no.

(tires screeching)

(breathing rapidly)
(distant sirens wailing)

Toby:
Dad!

Woman (muffled):
Toby.

Toby:
Mom!

Woman:
Toby.

Toby, are you with me?

The lost and found
program will...

allow you a chance

to... clear your mind
of these things.

To think.

You are going to have
such a wonderful time.

Yeah.


Cameron:
Watch out!

Man overboard!

(Toby gasping)


(thunder rumbling)
(Toby shouting)

Kay:
Okay, everybody, listen up.

Today was a superb day
of sailing.

You all did great.

Even you, Toby.

Yeah, Toby.
We've all had our moments.

That's exactly the point
of being out here.

I hope you've learned
a little bit about yourselves

and about working
as a team.

Which is what brought us
to this uninhabited island chain

of Pulau Aibai

and the final stage
of this course.

Now, you're each gonna camp

on a different island
by yourself

for three days
and three nights.

There are more than
a hundred uninhabited islands

around Malaysia,

so I honestly can't tell you

too much about what
to expect from yours.

You have a sleeping bag,
a tarp...

torch light.

You also have a parachute flare

if there is an emergency

and you need to signal
passing boats.

Got it?

What are we supposed
to do for three days?

Sit.

Think. Explore.

It's entirely up to you.

The point of a solo
is introspection.

It's a chance to think
about why you're here

in the first place...

and the kind of person
you decide to be

in the future.

(ominous music playing)

Kay:
You may not think so,

but you're a different guy

from the one I met
two weeks ago.

(ominous music playing)

You got dropped off first,
so I'll pick you up first.

Meet me here at the crack
of dawn in three days

with your stuff packed.

Hey, man, look around you.

People spend a fortune
to be in a place like this.

It's your own slice
of paradise.

(motor starts)

(waves lapping)


Fuck.

(flies buzzing)


All right, Robinson Crusoe.

Let's see what you got.

Hey.

Did you know that
there was clear-cut signs

that Robin Crusoe was gay?

Really?

Oh, yeah.

It's laden with innuendos.

No kidding.

It's really progressive
for the time

for Western society's
strength and imperialism.

Like the, uh, systematic raping

of indigenous cultures
and resources?

Wow.

Really no wonder
you can't make any new friends.

Build a nice tent though.

High five.

(bird calling in distance)

Right here.

(leaves rustling)

(animal yipping in distance)


Oh. Coconuts

Wonder if they're organic.

Let's see.

(screams, gasps)

Oh, shit. Oh!

(monkeys screeching)

Hey. Hey!

Hey. No. Get out!

(screeching)
(panting)

God damn it.

(flies buzzing)

Yeah. Uninhabited, my ass.

(screams, groans)

Shit!

Yeah, a great moment
in survival instincts, Toby.

Genius.

Ow!

Clams.

(retching, coughing)

Oh, shit.

Where are they?



What?

Hello?

Shit! Oh!


Where is it?

Dad.


Shit.

Oh!

Oh.

Oh.

(animal squealing)

(Toby screams)

(animal squealing)

Toby: Hey.

Wait.

Ah.

(animal crying in pain)

(girl grunts)

(girl breathing heavily)

Can't stay here.

Need to go.

Okay.

Hey.

So, uh...

So, do you live here?

Is there...

Is there a town close by?

I could really use
something to eat.

Oh.

I'm part of this, uh,
lost and found program.

You heard of it?

It-It's like this program for...

kids who mess up,
I guess. I...

Teach you how to get
in touch with your feelings,

something about
personal growth and...

and then throw...
throw you out into an island

and you have
to survive in nature.

On purpose?

Yeah.

It's pretty stupid I guess.

Mm. It's...

Oh, it's actually
really delicious.

Hmm.

Hey, um...

who built this dam?
It's really cool.

Girl:
The missionaries.

Oh. Hey, wh...

where're you going?

Home.

Toby:
Oh, okay. Uh...

Should I go back
to my camp or...

Girl:
No. It's dangerous.

Uh, wait. I'm sorry, wha...

What, what's dangerous?

Uh...

Hey, okay.

Wha...

How... how far is the beach
from here? Hey.

Can you at least
tell me your name.

Hey! Oh, shit!

Stay close to the fire.

The snakes don't like fire.

My name is Madeleine.

Toby:
Alright.

Stay close to the fire.

Staying close
to the fire.

(exhales forcefully)

Fuck.


(breathing heavily)

(groans softly)


(debris rattling)

Madeleine?

(rattling, tinkling)

(leaves rustle)

(flies buzzing)



Are those eggs?

Chicken eggs?

You're funny.

Ah!

Madeleine:
That looks bad.

It's, uh...

I'm sure it's fine.

Let's eat first, then I'll get
you some medicine later,

okay?
All right.

Hey, are there any, um...

like, horned animals,

like these big goats,
on this island?

Why? Have you seen any?

Toby:
I don't know what I saw.

So, how long have you
been here for?

Madeleine:
Since I was little.

Yeah? Were, were there
other people here too?

Madeleine:
Some people. Friends.

My mother. My daddy.

Are they, are they still here?

Madeleine:
Just my mother.

My daddy died a long time ago.

I'm sorry. I...

I... My dad died too.

I'm sorry.

It's all right.

Toby: Here?
Madeleine: Here.

Oh, okay.

What are they?

They're special.

You don't eat them until
we're ready to fall asleep.

What do they do?

Madeleine:
Here.

Wait, I...

Oh, my god,
they're, like, numb.


Wha...

Hey, wait, I...


Great.

Hey, where are we going? I...


Toby: Infinite connection
of computers.

Uh...

Madeleine:
Computers?

Toby: Th-That's what
you use, like...

Never mind. Um...

Hey, um, I need to talk
to you about tomorrow.

It's getting dark.

What... what is all this?

Just keep this with you, okay?

Why, is that horned thing
gonna come out of here?

My mother good.

Okay.

She'll kill you
if she finds you.

Good night, Toby.

What?
I have to go.

What are you talking about?

You can't ever go
through here, okay?

You'll die if you do.

Hey, look, what are you,
no, talking about?

I'll see you tomorrow.

Toby: No, no, tomorrow.
I leave tomorrow.

Kay is picking me up
first thing in the morning.

What?

You were just gonna leave
without telling me?

No, that's what I was trying
to tell. I...

Look. Don't go back there
if it's not safe.

If you wanna leave,
then just leave.

Madeleine, stop! I, I...

Madeleine!

(voice echoing)
Madeleine!

Toby!

Hello!

(insects chirping)

Hello!

Toby!

It's Kay.

Are you all right?

I heard screaming from the boat.

(leaves crunching)
(Kay gasps)

I swear to God,
if you're messing with me...

(grunts, groans)

Damn it.


Who is that?

Toby?

Toby?

Toby?

Stop screwing around!

You are seriously jeopardizing
the other pick-ups.

I don't have time
for all this...


(ominous music playing)


Toby, God damn it.
Is that you?


(shaky breathing)



Oh, shit.

Shit.

It's gotta be here
at least. I...


(ominous music playing)

(gasping, panting)

Kay!


(metallic creaking)


(creaking continues)


God, Kay.


(rattling, tinkling)

(eerie music playing)




(bat squeaks)
(Toby gasps)

(flashlight clatters)

Toby: Shit.

No, no, no, no, no.
No. No, no, no, come on.



(breathing heavily)

(eerie music playing)

(ominous music playing)



(weak bleating)

(bleating stops)



Shit.

Yes.

Yes. Yes.

(static crackling, hissing)

Uh...

Mayday. Mayday.

This is The Seaker.
Does anyone copy?

(static hissing)

Uh, mayday. This is The Seaker.
Do you copy?

(static hissing)

Man (on radio):
<i>Who is this?</i>

<i>Who is this?</i>

Yes, y-yes.
Copy, copy. Um...

Listen, the boat has sunk.

My name is, uh, Toby Burns.

I'm part of a lost
and found program.

I'm stranded
on a deserted island.

Please, uh, someone is dead.

I-I'm in the Pulau Aibai
island chain.

(static hissing)

Please, please,
does, does anyone copy?

(static hissing)

Hello?

(static hissing)

You left the door open again.

That's how animals keep getting
into the food.

Yes, I know.

You've told me a hundred times.

Woman:
And you still don't listen.

You don't ever listen to me.

Woman:
That's not true, Madeleine.

I'm done talking about this.

You're not ready
to go out there.

Go fetch some water
before dinner.

From now on,
you stay around the house.

Madeleine:
Why?

Woman:
Because you can't be trusted.

Is that clear?

Madeleine.

If you see anyone,

you tell me right away.


Woman:
Is that clear?

(whispering) Answer her.
Woman: Madeleine?

Fine. Sorry.

You should go down
to the beach.

You can't be here, okay.

Madeleine.

Go east to the rock beach.
I'll meet you there.

Go. Go.
Woman: Madeleine.

Madeleine: Yes.
Woman: Fetch some water.

And bring in some wood too.

Fine.
Woman: Hey.

You're 16.

You have to trust me.

I'm your mother.


(dramatic music playing)



(dramatic music continues)

(rattling, tinkling)


I'm so glad you're okay.

After you left,
Mother disappeared,

and I was so worried about you.

I thought you were leaving.

Madeleine, that...

person that was supposed
to pick me up...

she's dead.

I found her boat shipwrecked.

And I found her body.

And...

I saw your mother.

She was swimming away
from the boat.

I think she killed her.

I think she killed Kay.

Madeleine, what...

What happened here?

I just remember some things.

Like...

We used to build

and fish...

and play hide-and-go-peek
in the trees.

We used to be happy.

Then something happened.

I just remember...

crying alone in the corner...

and Mother covered in blood
telling me not to look.

And now I just,

I see these things at night.

These terrible things at night.

Like there's...

some monster
always around me.

I think she killed them all.

She isn't safe.

We need to get you
out of here.

Where would we go?

She could find us
anywhere on this island.

Oh, I-I found Kay's radio
in your mother's hut.

I'm sure there's a boat
searching for me and the others.

I could send a signal.
We can get out of here.

Come with me.

Please.

Okay.

Okay, I'll be back here
tomorrow.

Don't leave without me.

I won't.

Be safe.

(airplane droning)

Shit.

Shit. Uh, hey!

No.

Hey! Hey!

Hey! No! Over here!

(airplane passes overhead)

(door rumbling, creaking)

(wood creaking)






You wanna top it off?

<i>Okay, hot rod.</i>

(keys jingling)

She's all yours.

Square key.

Teeth down.

(engine roaring)

Gas.

Shit.

(Toby panting)

Damn it.

Oh! Shit! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Cameron. Oh, shit, man.
Toby!

What, w-what are you doing here?

I...

Kay never showed up.

I found a rowboat. I...

What the hell's going on, man?

Oh, shit.

Come here. Look at me.

Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

Look, look at me.
It's okay. Hey. Hey!

That lighthouse is
a hundred years old.

Even if we could
get it to work...

I know no boats
come around here.

I mean, why would they?

I think we get back
to my island.

It's definitely empty.

I'm not leaving without her.

Are you serious?

Dude, we're not staying here
with crazy murderers.

You don't even know
if they're alone.

I've been on both sides
of the island. They are.

You've obviously
never seen "Deliverance."


And we do not belong
out here.

She's stuck here.

Just like us.

I have to help her.

All right, well...

first, we get across
the channel

and then come back for her
once we get rescued.

You've been here what,
six days,

and now you're like Rambo
or something.

Where are you going?

Her house.

Dude.

Those clams must've gotten
into your brain.

This is a survival course.

Remember? Survival.

Let's just get out of here
while we still can.

Are you gonna let some
crazy bitch torture you?

Hey!

I'm sorry.

I can't leave her
on this island.

I have to help her.

Madeleine.

Hey.

Hey. Hey, it's me.

(Toby grunting)
Woman: Let it go.

Let it go.

Wha... What...

Wha-What have you done
with her?

Oh, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

Look, I-I-I don't know
where she is.

Okay? Just...

Please let me go, Okay? I...

You need to listen to me.

Madeleine is in trouble.
She shouldn't be...

Hey!
Toby: Shit.

(dramatic music playing)


(groaning, crying)


(breathing heavily)


You have no idea...

what you're doing.

I know enough.

I know that you killed Kay.

You probably killed
your own husband.

No.
You keep your daughter prisoner

on this island by feeding her
made-up bullshit.

I was only trying
to keep people away.

I didn't kill them.

Then who killed Kay?

Huh?

(groans)
Toby: Who killed her?

She killed them.

She killed them all.

No.

No, you're insane.

(woman breathing heavily)

He tried to warn us.

Woman: <i>Something...
was always here.</i>

<i>Appeased with sacrifices.</i>

We didn't understand.

(muffled indistinct dialogue)

Woman: <i>All it wanted
was the right host.</i>

She was just a little girl.

(growling softly)

(inaudible dialogue)

(ominous music playing)

(inaudible dialogue)


Woman:
<i>She spared none.</i>

<i>None, but me.</i>


Take these...

to subdue it.

And it doesn't like the light.

You cannot let her leave
this island.

(rattling, tinkling)

Toby?

(twig snaps)

Toby?

Toby, is that you?

Who is it?

Toby, come on, man.

(growling)
(Cameron screaming)



(growling softly)

What did you do?

I-I...

Madeleine, I...

I did it for us.

We can finally leave together.


What's wrong?

Nothing.

(growling)
(Toby grunting)


(liquid sloshing)

Dad:
<i>Okay, hot rod.</i>

She's all yours.


Really give it a crank.



(motor starts)

(engine starts)


(growling softly)

(growling gets louder)

(motor sputtering)

Ah!




(eerie music playing)

Madeleine?

Ah!

(breathing heavily)

(growling softly)



(growling softly)

Oh.

(Madeleine growling softly)

(growling loudly)

(little girl crying)

(crying continues)

Ah!
(shrieking)



(ship horn blaring)

(raspy breathing)



(door creaks)

(door closes)

Hey!

Man: What was the name
of the boat?

Was there anyone else
on this island?

Relax. You're safe now.

(eerie music playing)

(rock music playing)
