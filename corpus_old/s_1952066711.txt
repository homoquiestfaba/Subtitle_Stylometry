Once upon a time ...
in the Kingdom of Hauptmann Koenig

Come here.

I love you.

Jesse!

I missed you.

More!

Again!

What will you do with me now, sir?

Find a priest, take a house
and live happily ever after.

But what about your mother?

You know how she feels
about mixed marriages!

By sunset we'll
be man and wife.

and the queen, bless her soul,
will be out my life.

He's comming!
He's comming!

Go!

Everybody!

Take another side!

Stand back!

Make place!
I am the prince!

We are here on
queen's business.

We have orders to arrest
your peasant girl.

Over my dead body.

Do not draw that sword unless
you intend to use it, sir.

I think he means it.

Sir, I would it in private.

We soldiers are working
on a queen business.

Can't you try yo see things...

Unhang her!

Here you got!

My Prince!

Jesse!

I love you!

I love you!

My prince!
Jesse!

William!

Queen!
The Queen!

Stop picking those soldiers

and get away from that peasant girl!

To the ground, you
scamming trolls!

I love her mother,
I will always love her.

He's still my son.
She's only after the royal jewels.

You know she's not our tipe.

Come home with me and we'll
discuss over some mutton.

Give her the gift.

Well, my little sweety pie,...

I don't want gold,
or your jewels.

Get out of the way.

No. But I have gold and jewels.

Jesse!

Let us make this.

A simbol of our eternal love.

Then I will wear it forever.

You have cursed my gift.

It's not me, darling.
It's the work of Spretzzel.

Brilliant.
Simply brilliant.

Frozen forever.

Other curse was nothing, my queen.
Nothing know nothing.

Mother, I have never
asked you for anything.

I beseak you to take my life
and spare hers.

Rights. You're such a romantic!

A thousand years or...

until she meets a true love
from another land.

Only then can the curse in
necklace be removed.

No!

Is it a deal?

Yes, but you have cursed
your kingdom

for a thousand years!

my car insurance.

Why not?

Andy, can I give you

Car insurance is
not very romantic.

Say that after major
injury accident.

Andy, lets just leave that

Really?
What kind of friends?

The kind, that we
don't talk too much,

and never go out.

Excuse me.

Stay...stay back!

Why are you running?

Why am i run...
Why are you moving?!

Why she...gosh!

I saw you in the water and
in the wass-wagon.

Water - that's it!

It was the toxins in the river.

They - do strange
things to a brain.

Prince, why are
you doing this?

You've lost your memory?

It is a dream!

It is I. Jesse, your true love.

You are real?

Of course, I am.

You're beginning
to frighten me.

When was the last time
we saw each other. I mean,

before little swimming today?

Just a few minutes ago
on the bridge.

What bridge?

The one out of the castle.
We were under way to be married.

Don't remember the soldiers
and the sorcerer?

Legend is true!

What legend?

Umm, that sorcerer guy,

he put a curse on you.

You've...been frozen
for thousend years.

Oh, my Prince William's always joking.
Yeah.

I'm not kidding.
This is 20th Century.

20th?
Yeah. Umm...

Look!

of these before?

Sure I have.
Those are jester shoes.

Jester shoes...

Ummm, hey!

How 'bout one of these?

You really do love me, don't you?

More then anyone is going

It's you.

Who is that?
What is this place?

It's him.

The guy from the river.

What have you done with
the enchanted peasant girl?

You guys are not suppose
to be back in here.

I'm gonna have to call the security.

There she is.

That was the close one.

Not a word of this
to the Count.

We don't want to get him upset.

Ja, ja, ja. If we don't go to the airport,
to greet him, he will be upset.

Guys, you know...

You...She's just gonna be ok here.

I mean, we lock this
up at night, and

Ok, good. Lets go!

Lovely fellow.

Hey.

What did they want with me?

You're a national treasure.
Those are your personal guards.

I don't like them very much.

It's my stomach.

I haven't eaten for thousend years.

Come one, I know great place
