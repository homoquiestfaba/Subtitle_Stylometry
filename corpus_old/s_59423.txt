This is a true story about friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

This is my story & that of the only 3
friends in my life who truly mattered.

Two of them were killers who
never made it past the age of thirty.

The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past...

...too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.

I'm the only one who could speak for
them...and the children we were.

My three friends and
I were inseparable...

...happy and content to live in the
closed world of Hell's Kitchen.

The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground...

...a cement kingdom where we felt we
were nothing less than absolute rulers.

Hell's Kitchen was populated
by an uneasy blend of...

Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican,

and Eastern European laborers.
Hard men living hard lives.

We lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements.

Few mothers worked and all had
trouble with the men they married.

I buried one fucking wife,
I could bury another one!

Domestic violence was a cottage
industry in Hell's Kitchen.

Yet, there was no divorce
and few separations.

The will of the Church was forceful.

For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.

Yet, despite the harshness of life...

...Hell's Kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net...

...enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.

Crimes against people of the
neighborhood were not permitted.

When they did occur, the punishment
doled out was severe...

...and, in some cases, final.

A drug dealer from uptown
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.

A packet killed the twelve-year old
son of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.

It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.

Hell's Kitchen was a place of
innocence...ruled by corruption.

My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.

We each served as altar boys.

Everyone wanted to work
funeral masses,

since the funeral included a $3 fee...

...and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.

There was an active competition
between the four of us...

...to come up with the best
and boldest prank.

Two weeks into the new school year,

I found the nun's clacker in
the school hallway...

...and I was ready for the big leagues.

In church, it was used to alert
the girls as to when...

...they should stand, sit,
kneel and genuflect...

...all based on the number of
times the clacker was pressed.

In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.

You will be defenders of the faith.
You will be soldiers of Christ.

And you will receive the gifts...

...of the Holy Spirit.

It's gonna be a great day and your...

...parents will be proud of you.
When you were baptized...

...godparents made promises for you.
And now...

-You're gonna confirm those promises.
-Let me have the clacker.

What clacker?

Now!

Let everyone rise.

Let us pray.

Nuns are such easy targets.

John and I spent more time in
church than the others.

We were the only two in the group to give
any thought of entering the priesthood.

And John and I were intrigued by
the powers the priest was given.

A secret world of betrayal
and deceit, where people...

...openly admitted dark misdeeds
and vile indiscretions.

Confession was better than any
book we could get our hands on,

or any movie we could see,
because the sins were real...

...committed by people we knew.

The temptation to be part of that
was far too great to resist.

If we get caught, they'll burn us.

What if our mothers are out there?

What if we end up hearing
their confessions?

What if we hear something worse?

Like what?

Like a murder. What if
somebody cops to a murder?

Relax. All we've got to do is sit back,
listen and remember not to laugh.

Seconds later,
our booth comes to life.

I...sleep with married men.

Men with families.

In the morning, I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

Yes?

You see, I'm...I'm pregnant.

The father?

Take a number.

What are you going to do?

I know what you want me to do.

And I know what I should do.

I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

Look, I gotta go.

Thanks for listening, fellas.
I really appreciate it.

I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

She knew.

Yeah, she knew.

Why do you think she told us all that?

I don't know. I guess
she had to tell somebody.

Father Robert Carrillo was
a longshoreman's son...

...who was as comfortable sitting on
a bar stool in a back alley saloon...

...as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.

He had toyed with a life of petty
crime before finding his calling.

He was a friend...a friend who
just happened to be a priest.

You know what crap like
that does to your body?

Come on, Father, it beats smoking.
And it's cheaper, too.

Maybe.
So, what do you hear, anything?

No, nothing.

I hear you're interested
in becoming a priest.

Who says?

Word is you want to get the
feel of a confessional booth.

I don't know what you're
talking about, Father.

You don't?

Maybe I got the wrong information.

I guess you did.

I'll see you later tonight.

What's tonight?

I gotta drop some books
and magazines off...

...for the elderly and disabled
around the neighborhood.

Your mother said you'd love to help.

I bet she did.

Shakes...l don't want you
getting into any trouble.

Come on, Father, you know I never do.

That's all I wish for
you and your friends.

That's it?

That's it. Nothing else,
I swear, that's it.

You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

And kids shouldn't be listening
to other people's confessions.

I'll see you tonight.

All right...see you.

Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group,

which meant that he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.

But his real love was Carol Martinez,
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed.

Half Puerto Rican, half Irish,
she was raised by her father,

her mother having died at childbirth.

Carol stayed pretty much to herself but
was always comfortable in our company.

We could always count on Carol...

...to stand sentry on the first night
of the Ice Capades.

While crowds of families lined
the front of the Garden...

...waiting to see the skaters perform...

...we each had one eye in a hole...

...watching two dozen beautiful
and nearly naked women...

...get into their skaters' outfits.

This is what heaven must be about.

Carol, you want to take a look?

Like it's something I haven't seen?

You're so lucky!

She's so beautiful. My God, I could
die now and I wouldn't be sad.

When my friends and I were young,

...Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.

When he was young, King Benny
was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

Lucky Luciano did a lot of good for
this country during World War ll.

But you ain't gonna read about
that in any fucking history book!

There was talk King Benny was
the shooter of "Mad Dog Coll"...

...that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with "Dutch" Schultz.

And he opened up a couple of clubs
with "Tough Tony" Anastasia.

I was 14 when I first heard
about him. The story goes:

As a kid, he wasn't much of anything.

He was always getting the shit
kicked out of him in street fights.

And then one day, and who the
fuck knows why, some Irish guy...

...about 25 years old,
he takes King Benny...

...and he flings him down
a flight of stairs.

King Benny breaks all
his teeth in the front.

You know what King Benny does?

He waits. He waits 8 years...

...to get even with that prick.

He walks into a public bath house.

The guy's soaking in the tub.

King Benny takes out his front teeth.
He lays them down on the sink.

Then he looks over at
the guy and says,

"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."

Then he pulls out a gun...

...and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg.

Then he says to the guy:

"Now, when you take
a bath, you see mine."

No one ever fucked with
King Benny after that.

Revenge!

Revenge!

Can I talk to you for a minute?

I'd like to work for you.
Help you out, whatever you need.

You're the butcher's kid...am I right?

What kind of a job are you looking for?

Whatever, it doesn't matter.

It doesn't matter?

Everybody says this is the
place to come for jobs.

Who is everybody?

People from the neighborhood.

Let me ask you, what
the fuck do they know?

They know you got jobs.

Sorry I wasted your time.

Hold on a sec!

Come back tomorrow if you want to work.

-What time tomorrow?
-Any time.

You'll be here?

I'm always here.

My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week and...

...ate up only 40 minutes of my time.

In the dark club room, one of the guys
would hand me a crumpled paper bag...

...and direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.

It was a perfect way
to handle payouts.

Come on, let's go! Right here.

Let's see what kind of cash
you've got in that bag.

You gotta be nuts! Do you
know who you're taking off?

Yeah, we know, and
we're scared shitless.

Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

Hey, what you do there? Answer me!
What you do there?

This time they took my money!

You took the money from the boy?

The money they took is in the bag.

Let me have the bag.

Fuck you!

How about now?

All right, take it easy.

You're not smart anymore.
This make you stupid.

Let me have the bag.

Now, go!

What about them?

You care?

Then go! Go! Run!

I need somebody with me.
What if the old guy hadn't showed?

What you need?

My friends.

Your friends? What do
you think, this is camp?

These kids, you can trust.
I've known them half my life!

Okay, get your friends.

Father Bobby knew we worked for
King Benny, and he wasn't pleased.

He wasn't worried about the
pocket money, but the next step...

...when they ask you to pick up a gun.

He didn't want that to happen to us.

You think running for King
Benny is a good idea?

It pays.

A lot of things pay.

Not like this.

Most priests liked to
preach from the pulpit.

Father Bobby liked to talk during the
bump and shove of a pick-up game.

Good shot!

I found an art class for you to take.

You know I can't afford
to take any art classes.

You don't have to pay anything.
The teacher's a friend of mine.

It could be nothing but
a waste of time, Father.

Maybe, or it could be the first step.

First step to what?

Doing something with your life.

You never know, it may
help you get out of here.

You all can get out of here.

Guys, are we gonna talk
or play basketball?

Listen, I got a story
I want to tell you.

It ain't the one about the lepers, is it?
Cause that one gave me nightmares.

No lepers. Michelangelo.
He was born poor, just like you guys.

He was a painter, he was a sculptor.

He takes this job from the Pope.
Good money, good work.

Okay, Father, but why'd
the Pope call him?

Because the Pope was looking for
the best guy he could find...

...to paint the ceiling
of his church in Rome.

It don't sound like
that big a job, Father.

Well, for Michelangelo it was.

Michelangelo needed the job...

...because it paid more money
than he ever had in his life.

And that way, he could pay off the loan
sharks that were chasing his father down.

What's his father?

He was like a low-level...con guy.

Conned people out of money,
goats, sheep...

Goats?

Chickens, whatever he could, you know.

-Chickens?
-Chickens?

You know what happened?

He painted a ceiling no
one will ever forget.

Painted it like he was touched
by the hand of God.

Did he pay off the loans?

Every single one of them.

How long did it take him,
painting the ceiling and all?

It took him about 9 years.

9 years?!

That's a big ceiling!

I had a Puerto Rican do my
whole apartment in two days.

And he had a bum leg.

You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you guys.

Hey, just give us a job painting,
and leave the rest to us.

You know what it was?
The Sistine Chapel!

Sixteenth Chapel?

Who painted the other fifteen?

Outside events meant little. In a society
changing radically by the hour...

...we watched the images scatter
nightly across the T.V. screens.

Young protesters spoke about how they
were going to change our lives...

...and fix the world. But while
they shouted their slogans...

...my friends and I went to
funeral services...

...for the young men
of Hell's Kitchen...

...who came back from Vietnam
in body bags.

We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television...

...those protected by money and
upper-middle-class standing.

A growing army of feminists
marched across the country...

...demanding equality.
Yet, our mothers still cooked...

...and cared for men who abused
them mentally and physically.

For me and my friends, these
developments carried no weight.

They might as well have occurred in
another country...in another century.

Our attention was elsewhere.

We sat with Father Bobby in a third
floor hospital ward, visiting John...

...hoping he'd recover from
a punctured lung.

A gift from one of his mother's
over-zealous boyfriends.

I hope you like these.
You better not tell me you don't.

Father Bobby didn't let
that situation rest.

I gave on Sunday.
I'm in a rush, okay?

John Reilly.

The little punk!

He got out of line, so I put him
back in line. No big deal.

You put him in the hospital.

He's alive, ain't he? Look, if he's
smart, he learned himself a lesson.

What are you? About 220, 230?

You're a big guy. How much
you think John Reilly weighs?

80, 85?
That's not even a featherweight.

If this were a fight, you'd
be way out of your division.

Look, it was a slap, it was nothing.

Well, next time you'll be meeting me.

And I may not be in your division, but
I do weigh more than 85 pounds.

And you won't need a doctor when
I'm done, you'll need a priest...

...to pray over your body.

See you in church.

Father Bobby would've
made a good hit man.

It's a shame we lost
him to the other side.

We were down 7-6 in the last inning
of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game...

...against Hector Maldonado...
and three of his friends.

Come on, Davy...take this chump out.
He got nothing!

Shut up!

Who's that?

His sister.

What happened to her?

I'm not sure, some kind of cancer
got in her legs or something.

Worry about the game, come on.

Come on, Davy, strike the scumbag out.

He can't touch you Davy,
he can't touch you.

Hey, while you don't got any
legs, you got a lot of tongue!

This is it...home run!

Easy, Mike.

What the fuck you
looking at, little dick?!

She's nothing but charm.

Come on, Davy!

You can take him,
you can take him, Mikey.

Yeah, I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

You could've helped her
across the street...

...or you could've bought her
an ice cream.

You didn't have to throw the game.

Yeah, and now we're
the Salvation Army.

You ever wonder why there
ain't a Salvation Navy?

Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

He's no better than you.

He was today.

No. You let him be.

All because Irish, here, has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

Look, stay away from this,
fat man, all right?

You boys are soft like bread.
It's going to catch up to you.

And when it does, it's
going to hurt...bad.

What happens is our business,
not yours, okay?

You gotta stay tough to be tough.

Guy smells it when you're weak;
eat you like a salad.

Do you see that street?

That street is the dish of life,
and you boys are appetizers.

Somebody gonna come along, eat you
up and forget about you by dessert.

Take it easy, fat man.
It was just stickball.

Yeah, but going soft is a habit.

You have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it!

All right, all right, calm down.

It's like hanging out with fucking
Confucius over here.

Be funny, limp dick.

Look, this is just free advice
from me to you.

You take it or you throw it away.
It don't matter.

Thanks a lot, fat man.

In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions.

But in his mind,
losing that game meant...

...handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair...

...was more than the right thing to do.

Come on, let's go swimming.

The temperature topped out
at 98 degrees...

...on the day our lives
were forever altered.

I'm frying like an egg up here.
I say, we get some buttered rolls,

a couple of cold sodas, and head
down to the docks.

Can't you feel the breeze up here?

What breeze?
We're surrounded by a wall, genius!

The devil couldn't stand this heat.

Will you guys shut up, please?

I'm trying to get my burn.

It's 98 degrees!

-There's some breeze up here.
-It's a hot breeze.

We haven't hit the hot dog
vendor in a couple of weeks.

I don't know, Mikey. That cart guy
ain't like the others.

I mean, he gets pretty pissed, like
crazy when you try to take him off.

We can eat hot dogs...
or we can eat air...choose.

Air is probably safer, Mike.

Yeah, a hot dog ain't worth
bleeding over, Mikey.

Yeah, anyway, whose turn is it?

Yours!

-Yeah, it's yours.
-Mine? It's not my turn.

-Yes, it is!
-I went like last month.

-He went two weeks.
-You never went.

-Last month.
-Are you nuts? I went right after him.

I'm not going.

-Why?
-It's too hot.

If I walk down the
stairs, I'll pass out.

Mustard and onions. No soda.

I know you!

I look like a lot of people.

The scam was simple.

I was to walk up to the hot dog
vendor and order what I wanted.

The vendor would then hand me my hot
dog and watch as I ran off without paying.

This left the vendor with two
choices, neither very appealing.

He could stand his ground and swallow
his loss, or he could give chase.

The second forces him
to abandon the cart...

...where my friends could
feast in his absence.

I'm gonna need two napkins?

Pay my money, thief!

Wow! Ketchup!

I took it from him and ran!

I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry
Cleaners and Armond's Shoe Repair.

The vendor gave chase, a wooden-
handled, pronged fork in one hand.

You gonna give me two?

You know, these things are
heavier than they look.

Genius, it's the gas tanks
to keep the food hot.

They're heavier than shit!

Think we can push it, the three of us?

Push it where?

A couple of blocks. It'll be
a nice surprise for the guy...

...when he comes back from chasing
Shakes, not to find his cart.

The vendor tired at 47th and 9th.

I was on the other side of the street.

He was beat...but not beaten.

He could go ten minutes
more, just on hate alone.

Give it up.

What's wrong, Mikey?

Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

You guys were supposed to take
the hot dogs, not the wagon.

-Now he tells us.
-He's coming fast, Mikey.

He still near?

I got a plan! Come on
over by the subway!

The plan was as simple and as dumb
as anything we had ever done.

We were to hold the cart on the top
edge of the stairwell,

Leaning it downward,
and wait for the vendor.

We were to let it go the second
he grabbed the handles.

Then we'd leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back onto the sidewalk.

To this day, I don't
know why we did it.

But, we would all pay a price.

It only took a minute...but
in that minute...everything changed.

Guys, I can't hold it!

-Don't let go!
-I can't hold it!

I can't hold it!

Stop! God, no! !

Damn!

Sweet Jesus! What have you boys done?

What in the name of God
have you boys done?

I think we just killed a man.

While James Caldwell was slowly
recovering at St. Clare's Hospital...

...we were charged and remanded
into our parents' custody.

I'm sorry, dad.

'Sorry' ain't gonna do you much good.

Take it easy!
This is no time to get crazy!

You're going to jail and you don't
even know what the fuck that means!

Ma! Come look, Ma!

I don't know. Bastard!

He's just a kid!
He shouldn't have to do time!

Nobody in this family should have to do
time. I done enough time for everybody!

I hear you're short an altar boy.

You still remember what to do?

Easy on the water,
heavy on the wine.

And ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

Get ready...we got 5 minutes
till show time.

I'm gonna miss this.

I'm gonna miss all of this.

I've been doing all I can, but so
far every door I touch is locked.

I could run...we all could run.

Disappear for a while.

Nobody's gonna come looking.

Nobody's gonna care about us...
about where we go.

You run now, you're gonna
run till you die.

Hiding's not gonna make it go away.
People aren't gonna forget.

You've gotta face this.

I can't, Father.

I don't want to face it.

I'm too scared to face it.

I'm scared, too.

Nobody's more scared than I am,
but you gotta do it.

You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna make it through there.

You understand?

Come on. We got an audience.

I counted three rummies and
four widows on my way in.

Plus Fat Ralphie sleeping
one off in the last row.

It's the rain. Bad weather
always brings in the crowds.

This is one of my favorites.

What is?

"Whatever you do to the least of
my brethren...you do to me."

Come on.

We never saw the vendor as a man...

...not the way we saw other
men of the neighborhood.

And we didn't care enough about
him to grant him any respect.

We gave little notice to how hard
he worked, or that he had a wife...

...and two kids in Greece and hoped
to bring them to this country.

We didn't pay attention to
the long hours he worked.

We didn't see any of that.
We only saw a free lunch.

Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded...

...for a period of no more than
18 months, no less than 1 year...

...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

John Reilly, the court hereby sentences
you to be remanded for a period...

...of no more than 18 months
or less than 1 year...

...to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

Lorenzo Carcaterra.

Taking into consideration that
you arrived on the scene...

...after the theft of the
cart had already occurred...

...in consideration of that, the Court
hereby sentences you to serve...

...no more than 1 year, no less than
6 months at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

Michael Sullivan.

The Court hereby sentences
you to be remanded...

...for a period of no more than
18 months...

...no less than 1 year at
the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

And I might add...
had it not been for the intervention...

...of Father Robert Carrillo who spoke
in glowing terms on your behalf...

...l would've sentenced you to
a much stiffer punishment.

I still have my doubts as to
your inherent goodness.

Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

Could you do me a favor?

What do you want? Name it.

The past couple of weeks...

...my mother and father looked like
they were ready to kill each other.

Could you watch over them for me?

I will.

And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

You mean, you want me to lie?

It's a good lie, Father.
You can do it.

Come on, let's go.

Be strong.

I will.

The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders...

...housed in 5 separate units.

From the outside, the facility
resembled what those who ran it...

...wanted it to resemble...

...some kind of nice
school or university.

Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the 2nd floor of Group C.

We each had a private 12 ft room.
I'd been in my room less than an hour...

...when the panic set in.
It doesn't take very long...

...to know how tough a person you are,
or how strong you can be.

I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.

Hello, Carcaterra.

Toss your clothes on the floor.

Here?

Were you expecting a dressing room?
We don't have any.

Now, lose the clothes.

In front of you?

Let's go, let's go!

What's that piece of shit
around your neck? Take it off.

It's Mary, you know, the mother of God.

I don't give a fuck whose
mother it is. Take it off.

Everything.

You want me to stand here naked?

Now you're catching on.

I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

Now, what?

Get dressed.

There were four guards
assigned to each floor...

...with one -- in our case, Nokes --
designated group leader.

Ferguson was the only son of a
slain New York State trooper...

...and was on the waiting list
for both the New York City...

...and Suffolk County Police Departments.

Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.

Addison was a graduate of
a local high school...

...who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.

It was not a group of innocent
young boys at Wilkinson.

Most, if not all, the inmates
belonged there.

A number of them were riding out
their 2nd and 3rd convictions.

All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.

And as for rehabilitation,
forget it.

What the fuck did you do that for?

You got close to me.

So?

It bothers me.

I don't want to be near you
or your creeped out friends!

You know your time here
hasn't taught you shit!

You're still the same fucking
bunch of clowns you were...

...the day you walked in here.

Okay, everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

There's nothing to see.

Go on, go, sit down...
get out of here.

Go on.

That go for me too?

No, it don't go for you.

You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch. Go on.

You and me...we're gonna finish
this sometime real soon.

Maybe at dinner.

So...you Hell's Kitchen
boys get any lunch?

I got to smell it.

You got to smell it...

That's good.

Where you going?

You said to get lunch.

You boys don't need to get back
in line to get lunch 'cause...

...there's plenty to eat right
where you're standing.

You could smell it.

I'm not hungry.

Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

You eat...because I'm
telling you to eat.

I'm still not hungry.

I'll tell you when
you're hungry or not.

Now, eat.

Excuse me? What the
fuck are you looking at?

Get the fuck down on your knees
now and finish your goddam lunch!

Come on now, eat! Don't think you
got all fucking day, here! Eat!

You've got some mashed potatoes...
come on, suck up some of that jello.

Come on now, you fucking assholes, eat!
Don't be thinking you got all day.

Hurry up. Come on, now, let's go.

None of you clowns are leaving here until
these assholes finish their goddam lunch!

You got that? Hey you....

There you go, you can't have a good
lunch without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

Come on now, that's good.

Show the boys how you follow my rules.

Rules! You understand?

Hey look, boys, see how
he follows my rules?

Your shift's over, Nokes.

I'm not ready to go yet.
I still got a few more things...

...l gotta clean up here
before I can leave.

It's my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

Stay out of this one. It's got
nothing to do with you.

This one, I'm staying in.

Don't fuck with me, boy.

No, Nokes...you fuck with me.

I'm asking you.

You're eating into my shift.

I'll get out of your way...for now.

I'll take what I can get.

You boys get off your knees.

It's a tragedy. I'll tell you.

I don't understand you boys.

I don't think you know what
it means to have rules.

You gotta have rules,
and you gotta have discipline.

I don't know what it was like in your
homes and your home lives, but...

...in my house with my father,
there were rules!

And if you didn't follow the
rules, there was hell to pay.

You had rules, and you had discipline.

Sometimes, it wasn't nice, but
we learned. We sure did learn.

Right around there to the right.
There you go.

I mean, it's a simple thing, really.
You got rules, and you got discipline.

That's the beginning of the story,
and that's the end of the story.

We understand each other?

Turn and face the wall.

Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room, but...

...there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

What do you want?

A blow job.

Down on your knees.

Face the wall.

There are no clear pictures of
the sexual abuse we endured.

I buried it as deep as
it could possibly go.

What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night...

...was that it was
my fourteenth birthday...

...and the end of my childhood.

Early in my stay, I'd written and
asked my father not to come.

I couldn't look at my father
and have him see on my face...

...all that had happened to me.

Michael had done the same with the
interested members of his family.

Tommy's mother couldn't get
it together to visit.

John's mother came up once a month.

But no one could stop Father
Bobby from visiting.

So listen, let's try to keep
this on a happy note, okay?

Nokes warned us not to say
anything to Father Bobby.

If we did, reprisals would be severe.

You lost a few pounds.

It's not exactly home cooking.

Sit down.

This is where I get to see
all four of you guys today.

I loved Father Bobby, but I
couldn't stand to look at him.

I was afraid he'd look
right through me...

...past the fear and shame,
right through to the truth.

Shakes, is there anything
you want to tell me?

Anything at all?

You shouldn't come here anymore, Father.

I appreciate it and all, but...

...l don't think it's the
right thing for you to do.

I stopped off at Attica today on my
way up here to see an old friend.

You have any friends not in jail?

Not as many as I would like.

What's he in for?

Triple murder. He killed three
men about fifteen years ago.

And he's a good friend?

He's my best friend.

We hung out together.

We were close...
just like you and the guys.

We were both sent up here.

That's right. And it wasn't easy...

...just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

This place killed him...
made him not care anymore.

Don't let this place do
that to you, Shakes.

Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

I've got to go, Father.

I'll see you in the Kitchen.

I'm counting on you.

Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

Don't let them see you crying.
Don't give them the satisfaction.

You'll be out of here
before you know it.

You're gonna be okay.

I didn't want to let him go.

I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him at that moment.

A number of the inmates, as tough as
they acted during the day...

...would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.

There were other cries, too.

These differed from those
filled with fear and loneliness.

They were lower and muffled;
the sounds of pained anguish.

Those cries can change
the course of a life.

They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.

On this one night, those cries
belonged to my friend, John...

...when Ralph Ferguson
paid him a visit.

I was expecting to read 30
book reports over the weekend.

There are only 6 for me to read...
which means I'm missing how many?

This is English class.
Math is down the hall.

I want to help you.
You may not believe that.

Or you may not care, but it's the truth.

-You got a second?
-What, I do something wrong?

No. You did a great
job on your book report.

You really seemed to like the book,
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

It's my favorite.
I like it more since I've been here.

Why is that?

It's like...he wouldn't let
anyone beat him, the Count.

Took what he had to take,
beatings, insults and whatever.

And he learned from it.

Then when the time came for him to
do something, he made his move.

-You admire that?
-No, I respect that.

You got a copy of the book at home?

I got the Classics Illustrated Comic.

No, it's not the same thing.

Listen, I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

I've got something for you.

I thought you might like to have it.

Are you serious?

Well, you love the book that much.
You should have a copy of your own.

-I can't pay you.
-It's a gift.

You've gotten gifts before,
haven't you?

It's been a while.

-Well, it's my way of saying, thanks.
-For what?

That somebody listens...
even if it's just one student.

You're a good teacher, Mr. Carlson.

Listen, we can discuss the book
on Friday in class if you...

...think the Count can
hold their attention.

He's got a shot.

Any particular section
I should read from?

That's easy...the part where
he escapes from prison.

There you go, All Star.
Here's your locker room!

It was only a game...just a touch
football game, nothing more.

But a game I wish we
had never played.

Guards against inmates.
The guards practiced four times a week.

Our team was picked the
Monday before the game.

We had a 2 hour practice.

It didn't matter much.

We weren't supposed to win.
We were just supposed to show up.

Who's the toughest guy here?

How do you mean, tough?

Who can talk and have
everyone listening?

Rizzo. Black kid over there.

Michael saw an opening...a chance
to bring the game to our level.

Even out the field. But he needed help.
He needed Rizzo.

Black kid with an Italian name.
With him on our side, we had a chance.

Look, white boy, I don't know
what you play in the streets.

I don't care. But in here,
the guards call the play...

...and the play calls for
them to win the game.

Why?

Look man...

...guards stay clear of me, all right?

They stay back and let me do my time.

If I play that game and I
put a hurt on one of them...

...they just might change my cushion.

I'm not saying we gotta win.
I just don't want to take a beating.

You do every day.

-Why is Saturday special?
-'Cause on Saturday, we can hit back.

They don't fuck with you like they do us,
but they fuck with you another way!

You're just an animal to them.

-I don't give a fuck!
-Yeah, you do.

And beating them on Saturday
is not gonna change a thing.

Then why, white boy, why?

To make them feel what we feel
...just for a couple of hours.

Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

Nobody will get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

I call heads.

He called heads.
It is a head.

Let's go.

You're gonna die, mother fucker!
You're gonna fucking die!

None of you motherfuckers can cover me!

We got ourselves a game!
I'm feeling good today.

This shit feels good.

Fuck!

Get the fuck off me!

Yeah, keep smiling, you little piss ant.

For 90 minutes, we took
the game out of the prison...

...moved it miles beyond
the locked gates...

...and the sloping hills of
the surrounding countryside...

...and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we'd come from.

For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free!

Rizzo! Rizzo!

Rizzo...Rizzo.

Hey, Nokes.
Good game.

For once, we had a victory.
But it didn't last.

It couldn't last...
and all I wanted to do was die.

I was not alone in the hole. I knew my
friends were down in the depths with me.

Each in his own cell, each in his own
pain...suffering his own demons.

Rizzo was there, too.

I had lost any sense of time.

I thought you'd never wake up.

I thought I'd never want to.

John and Tommy, they're
on the other side there.

How are they?
They're alive.

Who isn't?

Rizzo.

They killed him?

They took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat.

Rizzo was dead because of us.

We made him think that going
up against the guards...

...in a meaningless football game...

...had some value...that it would
give us a reason to go on.

Once again, we were wrong.

Did they give you
your release date yet?

Nokes had a letter from the warden.

Waved it in front of me,
then tore it up....

When do you figure?

End of spring, early
summer or something.

I wish we were coming with you.

It would've been nice for all
of us to walk out together.

No use thinking about that. We're
gonna do a full year, not an hour less.

When I get out, I could get Father
Bobby to make a couple of phone calls.

Shave a month or two off.

-There's nothing to talk about!
-There's a lot to talk about.

Maybe, if people knew what was going
on in here, they'd make a move.

I don't want anybody to know.

Not Father Bobby, King Benny,
Fat Mancho...

...not my mother. Nobody.

I don't either.

I mean, I wouldn't know what
to say to anyone who did know.

I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

Either they won't believe it,
or they won't give a shit.

Yeah, I don't even think we should
talk about it once it's over.

We got no choice but to live with it.
And talking makes living it harder.

So, we might as well
not even talk about it.

The truth stays with us.

I want to be able to sleep one night...

...and not have to worry who's coming
in my room, what's gonna happen to me.

If I can get that, then I'll be happy.

Someday, John, I promise.

I was in my last hours as an inmate
at the Wilkinson Home for boys.

I was given four copies
of my release form.

The final reminder of my
time at Wilkinson.

I never heard the key
turn in the lock...

...and I never heard
the snap of the bolt.

You should be asleep.

I just wanted to say goodbye.
We all do.

I told him. I told him right
to his face. I said,

I don't care if you're paying me
overtime or not.

I'm not working those kind of hours.

Yeah, did you put in for it?

I put in for it!

Because I put in for it.
They don't give it to me.

I come in early for three days.
Do they give me overtime? No!

A part of all of us was
left there that night.

That night will never be
removed from my mind.

The night of June 1, 1968--
the Summer of Love.

My last night at the
Wilkinson Home for boys.

At 8:25 p.m. two men
walked through the doors.

The bartender knew their faces as most
of the neighborhood knew their names.

They were two of the founding
members of the West Side Boys.

They were also its deadliest.

The blond-haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager.

He robbed and killed
at will or on command.

He was presently a suspect in
four unsolved homicides.

He was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.

He once shot a mechanic dead for
moving ahead of him in a movie line.

The dark-haired man was equally deadly...

...and had committed his
first murder at the age of 17.

In return, he was paid $50.
He drank, and he did drugs...

...and he had a wife he never saw,
living somewhere in Queens.

He's making a noble attempt
to really change things.

-The Republicans will take the House.
-Well, we got a lot of work to do.

It's gonna take more
than 4 years to get....

They'll take it at
the mid-term elections.

He's got the charisma.
He's gonna do it.

He's our man. Reagan's
the man who's gonna do it.

Hey, Jerry...
What are they talking about?

They're talking about Reagan's speech.

Order those two men some
drinks and put it on my tab.

You tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen...

...and either a political conversion or
a change of conversation is in order.

Sure thing.

The gentlemen there would like to
buy you a drink on one condition.

You know the rules:
no religion, no politics.

You get my meaning?

Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

Can I help you with something, chief?

Not right now.
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

I ordered brisket on a roll,
with fries and...

...two baskets of soda bread.
I know how you like that shit.

Is that okay by you?

Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

Motherfucker.

That's him.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Bingo!

This is amazing.

Hello...it's been a long time!

Who the fuck are you guys?

Who the fuck asked you to sit down?

I thought you'd be happy to see us.
I guess I was wrong.

You know, I thought
you'd do a lot better.

You know, with all that training...
all that time you put in...

...just to end up watching
someone else's money.

That seems like a waste.

I'm asking you now for the last
time, what the fuck do you want?

Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

I can see how he might forget us.

You know, we were just something for
you and your friends to play with.

It's a little harder for us to forget.

You gave us so much more to remember.

You can't quite place us,
can you, chief?

Let me help you out. You're looking
at John Reilly and Tommy Marcano.

Yeah, that's right.

That was a long time ago.

So how you been?

Yeah, we ain't kids now.

So, what do you want?

What I've always wanted
is to watch you die!

You ordered the meat loaf.

The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

You fucked up.

Yeah, you were scared little pricks,
both of you.

All of you...scared shitless.
But l...

...l tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

I had you all wrong then, Nokes.
All this time I thought you just liked...

...fucking and beating up little boys.

You two motherfuckers
are gonna burn in hell!

You're gonna burn in hell.

Yeah, after you.

Did that hurt, Nokes?

Jerry, sorry, should've made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

John Reilly, how do you plead?

Not guilty, Your Honor.

Thomas Marcano?

Not guilty, Your Honor.

John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.

In all the years since Wilkinson's, we
had never once spoken to each other...

...about what happened there.
We remained caring friends...

...but the relationship
had been altered.

We drifted together, always wondering
if that moment would arrive...

...that would force us to
deal with the past.

One down, Shakes, one down.

One what?

One Sean Nokes.

Nokes?

At the time of Nokes' shooting,

Michael was working as an
Assistant New York District Attorney.

I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.

Then, he hung up.

-So, what did they say?
-What?

John and Tommy, what'd they say?

It's a little cloak and
dagger, isn't it, Mike?

Nokes?
Did they talk about him?

-John did.
-Yeah?

What did he say?

He said, "One down, Shakes.
One down."

I hear they hired Danny Snyder
as the lawyer, is that right?

It's temporary. King Benny's
gonna move in one of his lawyers.

Don't let him do that.
Snyder's perfect.

-Perfect? The guy's a fall down drunk!
-Then he is perfect.

Perfect for what?

Are you covering this
story for your newspaper?

-Me?
-Yeah.

I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey. Ask me
what movie's playing at what time.

I'm lucky they let me in the building.

Get some coffee?

Let's take a walk.

I'm gonna prosecute John
and Tommy in an open court.

What, are you fucking nuts?

Just hear me out.

You should stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick and save your life, counsel.

I'm not taking this case to win.

I'm taking this case to lose.

What does that mean?

It means it's payback time.

Look, John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

It's messy, it's not how I had
it planned but...here it is.

And you and l, we can finish it.

Finish what, Mikey?

You read "The Count of
Monte Cristo" lately?

I don't know...ten years ago.

You see, I read a little
bit of it every night.

I read words like 'revenge'.
Sweet, lasting revenge.

Payback time.

It's our time.

What are you saying, Mike?

I'm saying it's time for
all of us to get a taste.

I'm saying it's time
to put an end to this.

Let's walk.

So, I asked for the case.

I told them I was from the same
neighborhood as the accused...

...knew the mentality of the area,
blah, blah, blah...

They bought it.

And the connection between
John, Tommy and Nokes?

What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

We were never at Wilkinson's.
