           Brian: Hi.           

 The question I get asked,      
 more than any other by far is, 

      what's it like to         
      work with So-and-So.      

     The answers are            
     often interchangeable      
     general compliments        

       that give little,        
       if any information       

  about the actual experience.  

 What is it really like to      
 work with Sylvester Stallone?  

     Arnold Schwarzenegger?     

         Steven Segal?          

       What is it like          
       to work with JCVD?       

    The title for this movie    
    could have been WILT WW.    

 What's it like to work with... 

       This movie isn't         
       going to tell you.       

  It's going to show you my     
  impression of what it's like  

to be on the set with So-and-So.

    We've combined traits of    
    these action stars and      

     a few others into one      
     fictional character.       

 The great Vardell Duseldorfer. 

His friends simply call him VD. 

  Much of what you're about to  
  see, I actually witnessed.    

   And as they say on TV, the   
   names have been changed      

  so the guilty won't sue you.  

  And so, to my aforementioned  
  muses, thank you.             

 Now, let's find out what it's  
 like to work with So-and-So.   

       (80s-style hard          
       rock guitar music)       

   (applause from television)   

       Tara: Welcome to         
       Excess Hollywood!        

       Studio singers:          
       ¶Excess Hollywood        

Tara: Lots of dirt, no cleanup! 

           (laughter)           

Tara: I'm your host, Tara Grey. 

    (applause and cheering)     

 Tara: On the comeback trail,   
 the great Vardell Duseldorfer. 

    (applause and cheering)     

Tara: His adoring fans who often

      contract his              
      uberlong name to VD,      

 some things defy explanation.  

   But one thing is for sure,   
   his fans do love him.        

    First VD fan: I love VD.    

   Second VD fan: I've been     
   a fan of VD for 17 years.    

   Third VD fan: Keep it        
   comin', stay off the hook,   

   stay hot with the people,    
   this how we do it!           

     Fourth VD fan: To          
     have VD is to love VD.     

I've been a VD fan for 52 years.

           (laughter)           

    Ralek: You can say what     
    you want about Vardell,     

     but he got where he is     
     because of one reason.     

       He's the great VD.       

 Redheaded child: My momma      
 told me that VD was a disease. 

    Video guy: Duseldorfer,     
    number, number one!         

           (laughter)           

   Tara: The embarrassed        
   ubernatorial has wandered    

once again in front of a camera.

   Uzbekistan apparently        
   wishes to play host to VD,   

and welcomes him with open arms,

if not a nice, warm petri dish. 

       (toilet flushing)        

      Tara: What might          
      the Uzbekis expect?       

Well, let's hear from some stars

      who've had some           
      experience with VD.       

           Mr. Kove?            

 Martin: I don't kiss and tell. 

  Especially when it involves   
  something as personal as VD.  

           (laughter)           

    Tara: I know, how           
    about a Herculean quote     

 from Mr. Kevin Sorbo himself.  

Kevin: Working and Duseldorfer. 

   It's kind of an oxymoron.    

 Or a moron disguised as an ox. 

 No, don't, don't use that one. 

      I got a better one.       
      (laughter)                

   Working with Duseldorfer.    

      It was sort of like       
      juggling water.           

      You never really get      
      the balls in the air      

      and you have to           
      clean up afterwards.      

   VD: Oh, nice shot, Kevin.    

       Tara: Who would          
       have thought that        

    the former bodybuilder's    
    small... (laughter)         

  Time in office would be       
  punctuated a maid escapade.   

 Tara: (imitating Duseldorfer)  
 I was just trying to show her  

 how to work off the large fold 
 of fat the tummy bellyflap.    

    And it just slipped in!     

     Yeah it was accident!      

   And poof, it made a baby!    

            (buzzer)            

    Vardell: Fuck you, Tara.    

      Tara: We can support      
      his support of moms,      

   and public breastfeeding.    

   Tara: (imitating Vardell)    
   More public breastfeeding!   

   More public breastfeeding!   

    Tara: But what about his    
    bill to get goldfish,       

     yes, uh-huh, goldfish      
     in every home?             

   Vardell: Not the goldfish!   

   Tara: (imitating Vardell)    
   Goldfish propagation         

 reduces the greenhouse gases   
 and helps the children relax!  

            (buzzer)            

       Vardell: You made        
       goldfish dirty.          

   Tara: The movie that         
   made him go into politics    

   in the first place was       
   that Fascist Time Machine    

   wreck that detonated more    
   than his fragile career.     

        (bomb exploding)        
        (laughter)              

     Vardell: That was          
     the director's fault!      

    Tara: So can dysfunction    
    be dysfunctional?           

   Has the expendable actor,    
   yes, expendable actor        

  passed his expiration date?   

       It's not looking         
       good for our hero.       

 Possible movie trailer voice.  

           Thank you.           

Will our hero make it out alive?

  (determined, dramatic music)  

    VD: Oooo, you think it's    
    easy to make a movie?       

      You sit there in          
      your thong and your       

       air conditioner          
       and you judge me!        

      I'd like to see you       
      crawl through mud.        

  Sweat, work 20 hours a day.   

     I tell you, Hard Time      
     on Mars will make more     

  money than you can count to!  

          I show you!           

         I show you!!!          

          I show you.           

           (gunshot)            

       I did not retire,        
       I got extension.         

         (VD groaning)          

      (breathing heavily)       

       (saxophone music)        

       (clippers buzzing)       

           (VDlaughs)           

  VD: Old, young, old, young.   

          VD: Retired.          

          Not retired.          

       (clippers buzzing)       

            VD: You!            

          Will direct.          

              Hmm.              

         I will direct.         

              Hmm.              

       Studio singers:          
       ¶Excess Hollywood        

     Tara: Can our favorite     
     rehabinator rekindle       

his past and extend his career? 

       Will he "be back?"       

     Will Hard Time on Mars     
     be the spark VD needs?     

       Or just hard time?       

       Should we wish the       
       Uzbekistanis luck?       

    Or send them penicillin?    

      Only time will tell.      

     Intercom voice: VD         
     10 yards and closing.      

     AD: Quiet on the set!      

     [Ne mana] our director     
     Vardell Dusel-dorfer       

      has come to join us.

      Vardell: Thank you!       

        [unintelligible]        

           Thank you!           

            Action!             

     (light sabers buzzing)     

      (Sir Jeffrey groans)      

    Unidentified man:           
    Nicely done, thank you.     

      Thank you very much.      

            AD: VD?             

           VD: What?            

   AD: What're you doin' sir?   

     VD: We need more rock.     

           AD: What?            

     VD: We need more rock.     

           AD: Where?           

           VD: There.           

   AD: VD, you know, we have    

  set decorators that do that.  

   VD: I like set decorating.   

     AD: Yes, sir, so           
     what about the fight?      

     VD: Uh, what about it?     

      AD: Can we lock it?       

         Vardell: Lock?         

   AD: Lock means that we're    
   not gonna change it.         

        Can we lock it?         

      VD: We're not             
      going to change it?       

   AD: I don't know, are we?    

       VD: I don't know.        

      AD: I don't either.       

  Why did you let him direct?   

     Burton: He wouldn't        
     do the film otherwise.     

       VD: This is nice.        

     This is fun! (laughs)      

      Burton: Get him to        
      talk about his dick.      

     It scares him I think,     
     it makes him insecure.     

  Maybe he'll cover by heaving  
  and getting back to work.     

           AD: Dick.            

         Burton: Dick.          

           AD: Dick.            

       Burton: Dick, yes.       

      (VDbanging on tanks)      

   AD: Oh, wow my dick hurts.   

          VD: Really?           

 You want me to rub it for you? 

        AD: Maybe later,        

uh, maybe after the fight scene?

            VD: Yes!            

 AD: I'm uh, thinkin' about it. 

            VD: Wow.            

     AD: So, VD, what about     

   the fight, can we lock it?   

   (VDblows out loud breath)    

       VD: I don't know.        

      Maybe you should          
      teach me part of it.      

      AD: The first part?       

           VD: Yeah!            

           AD: Okay.            

             Mark!              

 Let's get that fight going on. 

       VD: Yeah, where's        
       my saber ha ha!          

     (light sabers buzzing)     

         Mark: Freeze.          

     Sir Jeffrey, would you     
     mind if I take over?       

  Sir Jeffrey: Yeah, actually   
  I would enjoy that.           

    Mark: Great, we'll call     
    you when you're up.         

      Sir Jeffrey: I'll be      
      working on my lines.      

        Mark: I need you        
        to use and trust        

   the length of your sword.    

     VD: Use and trust the      
     length of my sword.        

           Mark: Yes.           

VD: It's kind of like the force.

          (VDchuckles)          

     Mark: Yeah, the force.     

    Think about keeping your    
    hand in your pocket.        

    VD: Okay, in my pocket.     

           Mark: Yes.           

    VD: Okay, I can do that.    

       I can handle that.       

   I think we need the girl.    

          Mark: What?           

      VD: Yeah, the girl.       

  Mark: No, she's knocked out.  

 VD: Yeah, but she can wake up. 

  Mark: No, she's not           
  supposed to wake up yet, VD.  

  VD: No, she wake up, but      
  she want to come to my aid.   

           Mark: No.            

  VD: and knocks herself out!   

  Mark: No.                     
  VD: It would be very funny!   

      Mark: VD, we're           
      running out of time.      

       VD: Get me Louie.        

           AD: Sir...           

          Mark: VD...           

        VD: Page Louie.         

       VD: I would like         
       the girl, please.        

           Mark: VD?            

      VD: I want the girl.      

      Mark: Get me Maria.       

     VD, your chef, Louie.      

   VD: Louie, what were those   
   strips of things we had?     

          Louie: When?          

         VD: Last week.         

        Louie: What day?        

          VD: Tuesday.          

  Louie: That was the chicken.  

VD: No, it was not the chicken. 

Louie: Maybe it wasn't Tuesday? 

           VD: Maybe.           

       Louie: Wednesday?        

    VD: I don't know, it        
    was the strips of things    

  with maybe the light pesto.   

   Louie: No, the pesto was     
   on the chicken on Tuesday.   

         VD: Calamari!          

     Louie: Yes, calamari!      

     But that was Thursday.     

       With a lemon herb        
       and a sesame oil.        

    VD: Oh, it was Thursday.    

     Louie: Yes, Thursday.      

            VD: Oh.             

  Well I will have two strips   
  of calamari al dente.         

        Louie: Yes, sir.        

         AD: VD, Maria.         

      (tango-style music)       

         VD: Oh, Maria.         

          How are you?          

   Maria: Good, how are you?    

     VD: I'm very good now      
     that you are here.         

     We have decided to add     
     you into the fight.        

 Maria: Do I get to punch you?  

          VD: Uh...no.          

        Maria: Kick you?        

            VD: No.             

           Maria: Oh.           

     VD: But you do get to      
     slap me in the face        

with your fair and ample bosom. 

       Maria: Oh...okay.        

         (both chuckle)         

    (elegant fantasy music)     

        (deep breathing)        

      Maria: VD, you okay?      

           VD: Umm...           

     Maria: What happened?      

        (birds tweeting)        

  VD: Sometimes I see things.   

    Maria: What did you see?    

   VD: It was large and warm,   
   and it felt really good.     

    Maria: So, you're okay.     

           VD: Yeah!            

          Maria: Okay.          

           VD: Okay.            

   You know we have to do       
   the fight sometime today!    

              Yes?              

       Why don't you show       
       us the second part       

of the fight Mr. Choreographer? 

       Sir Jeffrey: You         
       will never get me.       

     The crystals are mine.     

      You'll never get me!      

     The crystals are mine!     

            Hmm hmm!            

   You'll never get me ha ha!   

            Oh, God.            

       A word, if I may.        

      Burton: Oh, Sir           
      Jeffrey, of course.       

       Let me know what         
       I can do for you.        

 Sir Jeffrey: You will never    
 get me, the crystals are mine. 

Does the previous sentence have 
a ring of familiarity to it?    

        Burton: Sort of.        

   Sir Jeffrey: Shall we        
   call it by its real name?    

         Burton: What?          

      Sir Jeffrey: Cliche.      

 Do you want me saying cliches? 

          Burton: No.           

   Sir Jeffrey: What exactly    
   was it about this script     

      that made you want        
      to make this movie?       

 Why don't you re-title the     
 film and call it, The Cliche?  

   Then it can be a comedy      
   and I can laugh about it.    

Burton: What do you want to say?

  Sir Jeffrey: I want the       
  words to not be plagarized.   

 I want them to have something  
 to say that vaguely resembles  

  my character, who is fucking  
  religious by the way.         

    "The crystals are mine,"    
    what the fuck is that?      

        What did you pay        
        for this script?        

      Burton: One hundred.      

     Sir Jeffrey: Hmmmm, a      
     100,000 dollar cliche.     

         (VD grunting)          

           (farting)            

           Mark: VD!            

VD: You may want to stand clear.

          Mark: Jesus!          

          VD: Wafting!          

   Sir Jeffrey: In his pants    
   right now, there is more     

   original color and content   
   than in your script.         

        VD: Whew, stay!         

             Stay.              

              Wow.              

             Maria?             

      Did you see the size      
      of that guy's bulge?      

  European men put it pointed   
  up to make it look bigger.    

  Maria: American men put it    
  down to make it look bigger.  

      VD: No, they don't,       
      it looks bigger up!       

      Maria: No, American       
      men point it down         

    to make it look bigger.     

  VD: No, it looks bigger up.   

          Maria: Down.          

            VD: Up.             

          Maria: Down.          

          VD: Up.               
          Maria: Down!          

          VD: Up.               
          Maria: Down!          

          VD: Up.               
          Maria: Down!          

  VD: Stop talking about dick.  

     Maria: Are you the         
     only one who's allowed     

to talk about it, Mr. Director? 

      VD: Well maybe I am!      

Louie: VD, I have the calamari! 

    VD: It looks fantastic!     

     (Happy Italian music)      

      VD: Mmmm-hmmm (hums)      

It is not as good as last week! 

       AD: Oh no, uh, VD,       
       sir, uh, umm...          

            Louie...            

         Uh, uh, Louie?         

           V...Louie?           

          (door slams)          

      Burton: 10 minutes,       
      we are taking break.      

     Why don't we just make     
     a movie about break?       

    Sir Jeffrey: At least       
    it wouldn't be a cliche.    

    You should have budgeted    
    for some star wranglers.    

    Burton: They have those?    

     Sir Jeffrey: Oh, yes.      

      Complete with ropes       
      and cattle prods.         

       Burton: Do you           
       have their number?       

     (old time space music)     

        VD: There, yeah.        

              Yo.               

           (snorting)           

      (VD clearing throat)      

           VD: Mmmm.            

     VD and friends: Aaahh!     

     VD: I could not do         
     this without you guys.     

          I love you.           

You guys always be there for me!

    I promise, I will           
    always be there for you.    

       What's your name?        

 VD: Okay, we start today with  
 a prayer and some meditation.  

        A little prayer.        

           5 minutes.           

             Quiet.             

       (cell phone rings)       

          VD: HEY!!!!!          

    TURN OFF THE CELL           
    PHONES AND THE WALKIES!     

    AD: Turn off the cell       
    phones and the walkies!     

    VD: AND THE CELL            
    PHONES AND THE WALKIES!     

             JESUS!             

     Burton: What is this       
     meditation costing me?     

      Five, ten thousand?       

    VD: Okay, we go to work.    

      Yes, maybe now we         
      can make some movie!      

 Lay down, lay down, lay down.  

            Quickly.            

             Okay.              

     Oh, is that beautiful?     

        Is that so nice?        

 Okay, so, you need to wake up, 
 you're asleep, you're asleep.  

             Sleep.             

          You wake up.          

     Okay, now, you got to      
     g--, we need something     

    for her to hit me with.     

     How 'bout, a...            
     (makes buzzing noise)      

   (buzzing noise continues)    

      VD: Rubber chicken.       

             Yeah?              

        Rubber chicken?         

          (VD laughs)           

    VD: That would be funny!    

  Or better, you know, there's  
  a lot of rubber chickens.     

         What about...          

      I think this is it.       

          Turkey neck!          

             Yeah?              

       Whup, turkey neck!       

             Huuuh!             

    Yeah what do you think?     

           AD: Props!           

 VD: Do you have a turkey neck? 

       Prop guy: I've got       
       this lizard thing.       

      VD: It is a lizard.       

        Prop guy: Yeah.         

  VD: Does your lizard speak?   

Prop guy: Not in my experience. 

 VD: On Mars, a rubber lizard.  

       Prop guy: This is        
       a big beef thing.        

   Maybe you could try that.    

       VD: Does it hurt?        

    Prop guy: Well, you try.    

          VD: Thanks.           

         VD: Hahahaha!          

      Prop guy: Go ahead.       

           You like?            

     VD: Yeah, that's good!     

   That doesn't hurt at all.    

      Yeah, hey come here!      

         Is this good?          

             Yeah!              

     What else do you have?     

    Prop guy: A wooden leg?     

         VD: A peg leg?         

  Prop guy: Yeah, it actually   
  belonged to my uncle.         

 VD: I don't know if it will... 

              Ow!               

        Prop guy: Jeez.         

      VD: It doesn't work.      

      Prop guy: No, that's      
      not gonna work.           

AD: Step back here for a second.

     Prop guy: Some crabs?      

   VD: That is a space crab!    

      Prop guy: Those are       
      hard to get rid of.       

           VD: Yeah?            

        Prop guy: Yeah.         

            VD: Oh.             

          What, umm...          

   A little aluminum missile.   

       Prop guy: A little       
       aluminum missile.        

    VD: An itty bitty           
    little aluminum missile.    

    Prop guy: A little bitty    
    tiny aluminum missile.      

     VD: What do you think?     

       Maria: It's funny.       

VD: Hit me on the head with it. 

          Hey, uhh...           

             (thud)             

    VD: Man, Mark, you have     
    a very big package.         

    What is that, kielbasa?     

    Maria: Are we fighting,     
    or talking dick?            

     VD: I guess I do talk      
     about dick a lot.          

    Can we kiss and make up?    

   Maria: I would like that.    

     VD: Did she say lick,      
     she would lick that?       

          Maria: Like.          

  VD: I would lick that, too.   

        (Maria laughing)        

         VD: I lick it.         

     AD: Alright everybody,     
     that's five minutes.       

        VD: Make it six!        

     AD: Okay, make it six.     

           VD: Maria!           

     Something's happening!     

       (Maria squealing)        

     VD: Cradle the balls,      
     work the shaft.            

     Paint: Cradle the          
     balls, work the shaft.     

 VD: Mmmm cradle, more cradle.  

    Crewman in orange: I        
    just had an inspiration     

    for a new crew T-shirt.     

          Paint: Sure.          

           (laughing)           

     Maria: It's been about     
     five minutes, baby.        

         Are you okay?          

     VD: What do stupid         
     doctors know, anyway?      

  Do you think they could wait  
  maybe five more minutes?      

   I don't want them to         
   think I went too quickly.    

    And maybe you could mess    
    your hair up a little?      

   Maria: Don't worry, we'll    
   have fun on the set.         

           I promise.           

    Crewman in orange: Two      
    pools, 20 dollars each.     

       One, we get a shot       
       of anything today,       

Two we don't get a shot all day.

    Vladimir: That is whack.    

            I'm in.             

       Prop guy: No shot.       

  AD: Sir Jeffrey would like    
  to speak with his director,   

 do you have a minute for him?  

VD: Oh, Sir Jeffrey, of course. 

       AD: This way, sir.       

  VD: Of course for Sir         
  Jeffrey, I always have time.  

     Sir Jeffrey: VD,           
     structurally, they're      

 doing a rather strange thing.  

 They're having a sub-villain   
 killed after the main villain. 

       VD: A sub-villain.       

 I'm a bad guy on a submarine.  

 Sir Jeffrey: No, no we don't   
 have a submarine in the movie. 

     We have rocket ships.      

            VD: Yes!            

   Sir Jeffrey: My character    
   is a main villain, so        

     anyone who would work      
     for a main villain         

    would be a sub-villain.     

     VD: A smaller bad guy?     

     Sir Jeffrey: Exactly!      

     So, why would you          
     kill a little bad guy      

    after you've just killed    
    the biggest bad guy?        

    VD: Because, he's a bad     
    guy and he has to die.      

  Sir Jeffrey: Yes, but um,     
  killing of the big villain,   

that's the climax of the movie. 

   VD: Climax, like, orgasm.    

  Sir Jeffrey: Exactly, right!  

   Yes, so after the orgasm,    
   do you have foreplay?        

       VD: No. (laughing)       

      I just, take a nap.       

      Sir Jeffrey: Right.       

   Because the movie's over.    

       VD: Right, I never       
       watch the credits.       

   Sir Jeffrey: So, why would   
   you kill a little bad guy    

    after you've just           
    killed the big bad guy?     

  VD: Because he is a bad guy.  

     Sir Jeffrey: Yes, but      
     you see, umm, killing      

   of the little bad guys is    
   the foreplay that leads up   

   to killing of the big bad    
   guy, which is the climax.    

    VD: I don't understand.     

   Sir Jeffrey: Okay, umm...    

  Action-adventure movies are   
  really like romance movies.   

  The romantic hero identifies  
  the beautiful girl,           

 chases after her, romances     
 her, finally gets to have her. 

           ...Climax!           

    Action-adventure hero,      
    identifies the bad guy,     

    chases after him after      
    some close encounters ,     

   finally the bad guy's        
   caught and killed, climax!   

   So you see it's, it's        
   almost like a love story.    

       VD: But, I don't         
       love the villain.        

  Sir Jeffrey: Well no, of      
  course, but , but you know,   

      you still wanna           
      fuck him. (chuckles)      

           VD: I do?            

       Sir Jeffrey: Yes.        

           VD: Where?           

          In the butt?          

        Sir Jeffrey: No!        

     VD: Well then they...      

           Or they...           

              69?               

       Sir Jeffrey: No,         
       it was a metaphor!       

        VD: A metaphor.         

      Sir Jeffrey: You          
      don't know metaphor?      

VD: Hmm, comes before meta-five.

      Sir Jeffrey: It           
      doesn't come at all.      

        VD: It doesn't?         

        Sir Jeffrey: No.        

     VD: So Jeffrey, could      
     you explain please,        

  but with the smaller words.   

 Sir Jeffrey: Look, as the      
 script is now, it's as though  

 you get to fuck the beautiful  
 girl that you'be been          

 chasing after the whole        
 movie, then you climb off her, 

   go into the next room,       
   and fuck her ugly sister!    

   Does that make any sense?    

            VD: Yes!            

       Sir Jeffrey: Why?        

  VD: Because, if you can       
  fuck the sister, you should.  

 Sir Jeffrey: But, she's ugly.  

VD: It's not the face you fuck. 

Sir Jeffrey: Do you know the    
expression pearls before swine? 

            VD: Yes.            

      Sir Jeffrey: Do you       
      know what it means?       

           VD: Yeah.            

     Don't feed pigs pearls     
     because they could         

     choke on them and die.     

     Sir Jeffrey: Exactly.      

             Right.             

            Call it.            

        (bells ringing)         

            VD: Yes?            

   AD: VD, the crew wants to    
   present you with a cake.     

          VD: They do?          

     AD: For our director.      

VD: Oh, hey cake for everybody! 

             ha ha!             

Cake cake cake cake I like cake.

           (applause)           

    Crowd: Congratulations!     

 VD: I don't know what to say,  
 I'm, I'm really very moved.    

        (camera clicks)         

     VD: I know that having     
     a crew like you guys       

     makes my job all the       
     much easier, you guys      

    are fantastic, and I        
    hope that we can always     

     work together              
     forever, forever, yes.     

      FX: Please, VD, blow      
      out your candles.         

         VD: Thank you.         

      Thank you very much.      

             Well.              

     (blows several times)      

          (explosion)           

          (screaming)           

           (laughter)           

    VD: Help me, I'm blind!     

           I'm blind!           

           (laughter)           

        AD: No, no, it's        
        okay, it's okay.        

      VD: I'm cake-blind!       

 (hyperventilates and screams)  

          AD: VD, VD.           

   VD, it's whipped cream and   
   it's actually pretty good.   

   VD: Well get it off of me!   

Burton: Alright, [unitelligible]

     (VD hyperventilating)      

    VD: YOU'RE ALL FIRED!!!     

  GET OFF MY SET, ALL OF YOU!   

      Right now, you fire

        Nobody was hurt.        

     VD: Get off of my set!

             Okay.              

      AD: Well that was         
      fun while it lasted.      

   [unintelligible] let's go!   

VD: Okay, it's working, oh yes! 

  Sir Jeffrey: Sophocles heard  
  it long ago on the Aegean,    

  and it brought into his       
  mind the turbid ebb and flow  

        of human misery.        

         VD: Oh, oh...          

       Sir Jeffrey: Down        
       the vast edges and       

  naked shingles of the world.  

   (mellow, sad instrumental)   

    (VD mumbles and groans)     

       VD: Oh, oh S-Sue,        
       I was in the warm.       

        I saw the warm.         

 VD: Thank you, my little fish. 

          (bell rings)          

      (light saber sounds)      

 AD: Alright, time to get back  
 to work, bring me [Ovka].      

  Touch-ups, after rehearsal.   

      VD: Okay, at this         
      point in the fight,       

     get rid of the swords.     

     We're going to grapple     
     mano a mano, yeah?         

             Okay.              

  By now, Darkwing has managed  
  to get me in a sleeper hold.  

     But the last minute, I     
     will overpower him and     

       [unintelligible]         
       him on the ground.       

    Mark: VD, nobody can get    
    out of a sleeper hold.      

       VD: Ah, bull shit.       

     I do it all the time.      

   Mark: You said you wanted    
   the fight to be realistic?   

       Nobody can get out       
       of a sleeper hold.       

VD: I do it all the time, Mark! 

Mark: It's gonna knock you out. 

        VD: Ha ha ha ha.        

  Put one on me, come on, give  
  it your best shot, stuntman.  

    Mark: Listen, let's         
    continue the fight, huh?    

       VD: Are you afraid       
       of the great VD?         

      You think I don't         
      know what I'm doing?      

    You think I got this way    
    from being photographed?    

 My chi will overpower your chi 

       and that is what         
       you are afraid of.       

     Bring it on, stuntman.     

 Put your best move on me now.  

      Mark: VD, it's            
      gonna knock you out.      

      VD: Bullshit, do it.      

      Mark: Get the medic.      

      Tell him he's gonna       
      need to revive VD.        

        VD: Ha ha ha ha.        

 Burton: What's happening here? 

       VD: One minute, I        
       am proving a point       

   to the bullshit stuntman.    

       Burton: Ha, okay.        

     VD: Don't do anything      
     until I say go.            

         Are you ready?         

          Mark: Ready.          

            VD: Huh?            

              Go!               

           Mark: One.           

              Two.              

           (lullaby)

             Medic?             

  Oh, crap he pissed himself.   

   Medic: His pulse is good.    

     AD: Alright, alright.      

      Get wardrobe in here      
      to change his pants.      

           Hey, look.           

   VD wakes up, and he finds    
   out that we know that        

he pissed his pants, we're gonna
kiss off the whole day, huh.    

   Best Boy: I thought that's   
   what we're doing already.    

   AD: Come on, come on,        
   pants, fly it on in here!    

   (exclaiming and laughing)    

  Paint: He stuffs his pants?   

    Vladimir: That is whack.    

    Paint: Has somebody         
    got a magnifying glass?     

           A tattoo.            

      [Crewman]: He got         
      his Johnny tattooed.      

     Ivan: Oh man, what         
     that would feel like.      

Jam: No, no that's a rumor, man.

     I don't believe that.      

              No.               

    Tattoo artist: It's         
    definitely not a rumor.     

     Tattoo assistant: This     
     is what he wanted.         

 Tattoo artist: It took about   
 2000 pricks on his porksword.  

      Patrick: On the uh,       
      tip of his uh...          

      Craig: His manhood?       

     Patrick: His manhood.      

Craig: I hope he told you that. 

     I hope you did not...      

           (laughter)           

          Patrick: No!          

           I saw it.            

 He had a, he had a tattoo of   
 like uh, eagle's wings or uh,  

  a talon going over the tip.   

   Craig: How did uh, how       
   did you happen to see it?    

   What was the circumstance?   

   Patrick: No, he just         
   decided to show it to me.    

       Craig: So you kept       
       your trousers up.        

    Patrick: I kept mine up.    

    Craig: He just, he gave     
    you a quick visual,         

       and that was that.       

 Paint: Red talons on the left  
 and blue talons on the right.  

      It's like, an eagle.      

        Very patriotic.         

Ivan: Maybe he's wanting to fly.

Paint: No, I think if he wanted 
to fly it would be wings.       

AD: Get the pants on him, okay! 

             Mark!              

      Lay down next to VD.      

       We got a movie to        
       make here, now.          

  When the medic hits VD with   
  the smelling salts, okay,     

      I want you to roll        
      over, like he's just      

   flipped you over his back    
   and onto the floor, okay?    

    Hey look, with any luck,    
    he'll believe this, too.    

   Alright, the rest of you.    

   When VD wakes up, all I      
   want to hear is cheering.    

      Congratulations,          
      hey you were great,       

      hey you're the best       
      guy in the world,

           You ready?           

          Mark: Yeah.           

  AD: [Mator, camere], action.  

         (VD coughing)          

    (cheering and accolades)    

      VD: I tell you, you       
      bullshit stuntman,

    Who is the one with         
    the, embarrass now, man?

        Oh ho ho ho ho.         

      Mark: Yeah, VD, me.       

          (VD laughs)           

           VD: Whew!            

  Something smells like shit.   

   Ah, what, did somebody       
   step on a barking spider?    

  General, please stop          
  wafting in my direction, uh.  

    When did I remember to      
    forget to tie my shoes?     

              Ah!               

      I have a great            
      idea for the fight.       

   Um, the great VD is          
   going to fly in the movie    

 like House of Frying Dragons.  

              Yes!              

    House of Frying Dragons,    
    we're going to fly me.      

      AD: VD, why would         
      your character fly?       

   VD: Cuz he is a spaceman.    

  AD: Yes, but House of Frying  
  Dragons was a fantasy.        

  VD: Yeah, life is a fantasy.  

        Like Peter Pan.         

         Never grow up!         

     Never grow up, no way      
     not sir, no not me!        

           (VD gasps)           

VD: I just thought of something.

           AD: What?            

       VD: The first time       
       i had jellybeans.        

             Louie!             

 Get me some jellybeans and     
 take out all the yellow ones!  

     Louie: Jellybeans are      
     on their way, captain.     

         VD: Aye, aye!          

   AD: Alright, back to work.   

 FX: [There's stains] in here.  

    Paint: The design had       
    to come from somewhere,     

      even if it was just       
      his subconsious.          

     It's like a, that          
     makes it even better,      

     a direct snapshot          
     into his inner psyche.     

  I think he has color issues,  
  what's the whole thing        

  with getting all the yellow   
  jellybeans taken out?         

       FX: Maybe he does        
       not like lemon.          

      Paint: No, I think        
      he has color issues.      

       FX: I think that's       
       least of issues.         

   Paint: Well, that may be.    

            FX: Hmm.            

   VD: What happened to you?    

 You used to be my best friend. 

     Johnny doesn't come        
     out and play anymore.      

           (grunting)           

           (laughing)           

     VD: Uh, that's better.     

           Hi, girls.           

       (speaking Russian)       

  VD: Oh look, she has a        
  bottom like a little boy's.   

  ¶ Space Cowboy by Matt Long   

          I love you.

      (trailer squeaking)       

       (girls chattering)       

     VD: 10, no 15 minutes.     

   Then they will respect me!   

      (trailer squeaking)       

   VD: Somebody needs to cum.   

   Woman in pink bra: Let me.

 Burton: I had to work with VD. 

          I am idiot!           

   [unintelligible] schmuck!    

      We have to be out         
      of here by midnight.      

      We still have three       
      days' work left.          

       Emily, get him out       
       of his trailer.          

     Do whatever it takes.      

      Just pretend that         
      you're at the beach!      

        (Russian music)         

Emily: I want speak, to Mr. VD. 

         The great VD.          

      Ray: I made it work.      

      I've got VD's lines       
      in this script.           

         And it works.          

         Burton: Okay.          

       Uh, we have to           
       cut 10 more pages.       

         Ray: 10 pages?         

       Burton: Yes, yes.        

           Ray: Okay.           

        Is that enough?         

   Oh wait that's only seven?   

    Does that work for you?     

        Burton: Oh, Ray.        

     No no no, Ray, that's      
     not what I mean.           

      What if the bad guy       
      falls to his death?       

        Trips and falls.        

      Ray: By, by himself?      

          Burton: Yes.          

  It, it's logical, people      
  trip and fall all the time.   

 Ray: No final fight scene,     
 no dialog, no, no, no swords?  

        Burton: No, no.         

   Just uh, trips, and falls.   

           Like life.           

             Life!              

  Ray: Well why don't we just   
  have them kiss and make up?   

       They could walk          
       out holding hands.       

  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to   
  rape and kill your sister,    

      it was an accident.       

  Oh, that's okay because I     
  live my life out of love now  

     and I want you to know     
     that I love you too.       

         I forgive you!         

         Burton: Okay.          

    Ray: The bad guy and our    
    hero could become the       

      poster children for       
      anger management.         

      If we can make it         
      work, you can, too!       

   Burton: Okay, I get point.   

      Ray: Burton, thanks       
      for the job, really.      

         But I'm done.          

        I wish you luck.

     Paint: Not in America.     

  Did you know that his name,   
  VD, in America is actually

         Ivan: Really?          

          Paint: Yeah.

       (slow, sad music)        

 VD: You know Emily, last time  
 you were very angry with me.   

    I sent you flowers,         
    chocolates, candy, wine.    

 And I even wrote you a poem    
 and you did not respond to me  

 and it's my dying wish that    
 I have the key to your heart.  

     I do not have the key,     
     I cannot find the key.     

 And I just, I, I love you,     
 Emily and I, I want your love.

       Emily: No picture.       

    VD: Oh Emily, you know I    
    have to have a picture.     

           Emily: No.           

     VD: Oh, I'm kind of

             Whoa.              

          Emily: Wait!          

       (speaking Russian)       

      VD: She'll be back.       

         Burton: Emily?         

         What happened?         

      Emily: I am virgin.       

      Burton: He doesn't        
      want your virginity.      

 Emily: He wants take picture.  

    Burton: Cover your face.    

           Emily: No!

     You are so beautiful.      

  No flower or the things that  
  pop up out of the ground      

       in the spring can        
       equal your beauty.       

         I, I love you.         

             I do.              

         (camera click)         

    Thank you Emily, at last    
    my mirror is complete.      

  You will never forget this.   

        Emily: You come!        

      VD: Almost, almost.       

      Am I such a bad boy?      

    My mommy, she breastfed     
    me, I love breasts.         

       There is nothing         
       in the world that        

 a good breast suck can't cure. 

      Am I such a bad boy?      

     Okay, umm, checklist.      

  Let's take it from where      
  Maria doinks me on the head   

       with the little          
       aluminum missile.        

    Maria: You know, maybe      
    instead of hitting you,     

       I could help you.        

 VD: What are you going to do   
 if a woman doesn't have a gun? 

       You going to, blow       
       kisses at him?           

 Maybe you beat him up with     
 your batting of the eyelashes? 

              Huh?              

      Is that what it is?       

    You know, I get great       
    idea for your character     

   and you want to change it?   

          Is that it?           

  You want to be the director?  

          Is that it?           

     Maria: Sure, yeah this     
     will be fun, yeah!         

  We bring in all the helpless  
  girls and the great VD        

   can come and rescue them.    

    VD: What are you doing?     

       Maria: Directing.        

 You, get off my set, stupido!  

        Get out of here!        

      VD: You are stupido!      

 If only implants were brains,  
 then you could be Einstein.    

  And then, you could direct.   

              Yes?              

        Get off my set!         

          I fire you!           

        (Maria giggling)        

           VD: Women!           

     Ivan: It's still hard      
     to believe they're         

  not getting bad boy clause.   

      Paint: Unbelievable       
      with his reputation.      

              And!              

    I hear he gets to choose    
    his own call time.          

  Ivan: Who you have to fuck,   
  choosing own call time?       

        Paint: Producer.        

      Ivan: Oh, no no no        
      no, I mean in life?       

  Being dealting these cards?   

      Paint: That'd be the      
      dealer, the dealer.       

             Yeah.              

  Ivan: The dealer, the         
  dealer, the fucking dealer.   

   Paint: The fucking dealer.   

     Burton: VD I'm sorry,      
     we cannot fly you,         

  we just don't have the time.  

      VD: Mr Producer, you      
      will make the time.       

  Burton: No no no no, we must  
  shoot the fight scene as is.  

      VD: Mm-hmm, as fight      
      choreographer, you        
      shoot the fight           

       the way I say it         
       is in my contract.       

      Burton: (laughs) You      
      are the director and      

  the fight choreographer, but  
  you aren't the set designer.  

VD: As the fight choreographer, 
the next part of the fight      

 is in the air, is what I say,  
 you cheap Euro producer, huh!  

          Burton: Hey!          

      VD: You can't spend       
      5 Euro on a stunt?        

      Huh, I'll tell you        
      what, you take this,      

you go hock it for 10 Euro,     
and you build us a fucking set! 

Huh, what is this piece of shit?

     What is it, cardboard?     

        No, it's paper.         

     You give me                
     5,000,000 Euro, yeah?      

     You tell me this is        
     10,000,000 Euro movie.

      AD: Video, come on,       
      [unintelligible]          

          VD: Help me.          

           Excuse me?           

   AD: (exclaims in Russian)    

VD: What's happening out there? 

      (metallic clanking)       

     (speaking in Russian)      

      VD: Da, except I          
      don't speak Russian!      

    I know you want to help.    

       (speaking Russian)       

     VD: Keep the producer      
     away from me.              

  Keep him away from my butt.   

       (speaking Russian)       

      Sir Jeffrey: Harry,       
      are you awake?            

   I had to call and let you    
   know that he's stoned,       

     he's drunk, he's high,     
     he's wielding a knife,     

    I could get killed right    
    now, he's so psycho.        

   He's just rammed his head    
   into a fiberglass rock.      

         (rocks moving)         

        (glass breaking)        

       VD: That's better!       

      Paint: Can I say it?      

      Ivan: No, is...no.        
      Paint: I'm going to.      

     Ivan: Okay, go ahead.      

        Paint: Dickhead!        

           (laughing)           

  (Russians speaking Russian)   

  Soundman: Shouldn't you be    
  out there giving him a hand?  

           (laughing)           

  Sir Jeffrey: So you're        
  sending me back to the hotel  

    until you have ironclad     
    assurances that I do not    

       have to do battle        
       with um, a person        

  who is on drugs and alcohol.  

       (speaking Russian)       

          (zany music)          

            (crash)             

      Sir Jeffrey: Harry,       
      wake up Harry.            

            Come on.            

       You have no idea!        

 There's a psychopath on the    
 loose wielding lethal weapons. 

You're supposed to be my agent, 

     standing in front of       
     me and protecting me.      

           VD: AHHH!            

     Sir Jeffrey: Here you      
     are, off in America,       

  in a nice warm bed, and here  
  I'm on a set with a psycho!   

             Hello?             

             Hello?             

  (Russians speaking Russian)   

  Sir Jeffrey: You voiceless,   
  lawless, neutered coward.     

VD: Take that, you stupid rock! 

        (Russians cheer)        

            VD: Ah!             

   Take that you stupid shit.   

        Burton: Hey, VD!        

I've spoken to special effects, 
we're going to fly you.         

     I like the idea, it        
     will uh, give extra...     

   VD: Now you like the idea?   

 Burton: Visual interest to...  

        (Russians laugh)        

VD: You will be very happy that 
you have flown the great VD.    

          Sir Jeffrey!          

     Hey, let's run lines.      

       Leave us alone,          
       we are rehearsing!       

    Emily: What he's doing?     

      VD: Okay, uh, you         
      have the first line.      

       Sir Jeffrey: The         
       crystals are mine.       

      VD: The crystals          
      are for the people.       

    Sir Jeffrey: The people     
    are ignorant peasants.      

  They'll just piss away their  
  money on tithes and beer.     

       VD: I represent          
       the people's beer.       

   Sir Jeffrey: Are you         
   really going to say that?    

      VD: I wrote that,         
      I think it's funny.       

      Sir Jeffrey: There's      
      beer on Mars?             

       (VD clears throat)       

       VD: There is now.        

  Sir Jeffrey: Why are you      
  doing that with your voice?   

     VD: I heard that when      
     a director does that       

       it makes his voice       
       low and gravelly.        

    Sir Jeffrey: Yes, but       
    naturally your voice has    

   so much more color in it.    

    VD: My voice has color?     

   Sir Jeffrey: In real         
   life, you're so animated.    

  But when you act, you stick   
  your voice down in one note.  

           VD: I do?            

       Sir Jeffrey: Yes.        

     Why would you do that?     

  VD: Because it sounds cool.   

Sir Jeffrey: Yes, for a minute. 

  But you know, when you go     
  to a concert, don't you want  

  to hear all the instruments,  
  not just the tuba?            

      VD: A tube of what?       

          Toothpaste?           

 Sir Jeffrey: Come on you know  
 it's like, big brass horn?     

     Got a big bell on it?      

       VD: Oh, the tuba!        

    Bom bom bom bom bom bom.    

        I lick the tuba!        

             Oops.              

       I said lick, so          
       I have to, sorry.        

           Ha hahaha!           

Sir Jeffrey: Do chicks dig that?

       VD: They go crazy.       

  Sir Jeffrey: Boy, you've had  
  some breaks, haven't you?     

     VD: A little luck has      
     hit me on the head.        

      Among other things.       

    Sir Jeffrey: Is it true     
    that you went down on       

  all those chicks in front of  
  everyone at your birthday?    

         VD: Of course.         

 Sir Jeffrey: Aren't you afraid 
 of contracting something?      

          VD: Hmm-mm.           

       I never get sick.        

     Life, is the disease,      
     and I am the cure!         

     Is your microphone on?     

    Disconnect the cable,       
    I once knew a sound guy     

    who played me a tape        
    once of crews, you know,    

  going at it in his trailer.   

            (laughs)            

     You know what he says      
     when he's cumming?         

       Sir Jeffrey: What?       

          Crew: Awwww!          

       VD: No mommy, no!        

       That's fucked up!        

      Sir Jeffrey: Quite.       

     You must now swear to      
     me that you will never     

    tell a single soul what     
    I'm about to tell you,      

       or I will hunt you       
       down and kill you.       

  Sir Jeffrey: You have my      
  solemn word as a gentleman.   

           VD: Okay.            

 I will now tell you            
 something about the great VD.  

   No one fucks the great VD.   

  You give me one pile of shit  

       I will give you          
       100 piles of shit.       

 Burton, he told me that we     
 were making a 10,000,000 Euro  

     movie, he gives me         
     5,000,000 Euro, right?     

    What does he spend on       
    this set, like 10 Euro?     

  This set will look like       
  shit, I will look like shit.  

      I don't want them to      
      release this movie.       

   Burton is out there          
   right now eating his shit    

      and I am salting it.      

     As long as I do what       
     I am doing, I am free      

       to leave here at         
       midnight tonight.        

     Pretty brilliant, huh?     

        Sir Jeffrey: But        
        no one will ever        

  want to work with you again.  

  VD: Oh, bullshit, I got a     
  three-picture deal waiting,   

I could do a television series. 

      Sir Jeffrey: Really?      

   VD: Oh, my aching vagina!    

       What's the matter?       

  Sir Jeffrey: Can I tell you   
  a secret that if you tell     

 anyone else I get to kill you? 

      VD: You have my           
      word as a gentleman.      

 Sir Jeffrey: Your film is the  
 only job I've been offered     

     in the last two years.     

    This job saved my house.    

           VD: What?!           

       That is bullshit,        
       fire your agent!         

    You are the best actor!     

   Sir Jeffrey: VD, there       
   are a million good actors,   

      but very few stars.       

        You are a star.         

      I am just an actor.       

 VD: Ha ha no, you are a star.  

      Sir Jeffrey: A minor      
      twinkler, perhaps.        

     Only a few stars rise.     

     And you have got yours     
     a long way up there.       

      VD: Yeah my star did      
      go up a little ways.      

       Yours could, too!        

   Sir Jeffrey: You know how    
   when you meet some people,   

     you just want to           
     rush up and hug them?      

      There's something         
      about them you just       

   want to hold close to you?   

And then there are other        
people who give you the creeps. 

           VD: Okay.            

   Sir Jeffrey: You have this   
   boyish quality about you.    

         It's adorable.         

  I am one of those people      
  who give others the creeps.   

            VD: No!             

 Sir Jeffrey: Who's playing     
 the villain in the movie, hmm? 

              Who?              

            VD: You.            

       Sir Jeffrey: Was         
       that an accident?        

            VD: No.             

  Sir Jeffrey: And it's okay.   

         Do I look sad?         

   It's been a great            
   living, most of the time.    

       VD: Do you want to       
       get out of here?         

     Do you want to get out     
     of this stinking set?      

Sir Jeffrey: I want to go home. 

  I want to hold my children.   

     VD: Then the great VD      
     will fire you, too.        

    Let's do it on the set      
    with more people around.    

   Maria wanted an audience.    

    Sir Jeffrey: She            
    wanted you to fire her?     

     VD: Yes she has to         
     leave tomorrow and         
     wanted to go shopping.     

      Sir Jeffrey: Really?      

            VD: Yes.            

She's going to buy me a present!

     Sir Jeffrey: VD, that      
     was great acting!          

          VD: Really?           

      (Sir Jeffrey laughs)      

VD: Well, thank you Sir Jeffrey.

     Think of some really       
     horrible things to say     

      about me, it will         
      be all the more fun.      

      Sir Jeffrey: I            
      think I could muster      

 a few things for the occasion. 

I finally get to do some acting.

     Yes, yes a performance     
     is in order!               

 VD: It's going to be fun, yes? 

       Sir Jeffrey: Yes!        

           VD: Good!            

     Sir Jeffrey: VD, what      
     a brilliant surprise.      

It's been fun working with you. 

    VD: Well not everyone       
    has said that about me.     

           Thank you.           

  You see, I want to hug you.   

     Burton: I told you he      
     hits for other team.       

        Emily: Baseball?        

       VD: See you on the       
       set, Sir Jeffrey.        

     (whistles ¶The Good,       
     the Bad and the Ugly¶)     

     Sir Jeffrey: You know      
     what your problem is?      

 No one says no to you anymore. 

     When was the last time     
     anyone said no to you?     

    When was the last time      
    you said no to yourself?    

VD: What are you talking about? 

   Sir Jeffrey: What is a       
   man if his chief good and    

     market of his time         
     be to sleep and feed.      

        A beast no more.        

      The best part of you      
      is not being fed.         

          VD: Why not?          

  Sir Jeffrey: Because you've   
  locked it away from yourself  

  and from everyone else with   
  bars of coke and drugs.       

 VD: It's not bars, it's lines. 

     Sir Jeffrey: Whatever!     

          It's drugs.           

 It's killing your discipline.  

   And you being a star, it's   
   killing the discipline       

    of everyone around you.     

    You have too much power.    

   And everyone is afraid       
   of losing favor with you,    

    or you're going to use      
    your power against them.    

     Everyone is afraid         
     to say no to you, but      

       all they have to         
       do is just say no.       

 VD: You want to say no to me?  

   Sir Jeffrey: Yes, everyone   
   should say no to you.        

   Because you are an addict,   
   and you belong in rehab.     

     VD: You say no to me?      

       Sir Jeffrey: Yes,        
       I say no to you.         

 VD: You want to say no to me?  

       Sir Jeffrey: Yes.        

        VD: You say no?         

       Sir Jeffrey: Yes.        

         VD: No or yes?         

    Sir Jeffrey: I say no to    
    you, and everyone else      

 should say no to you as well!  

      VD: You want to say       
      no to the great VD.       

  Ha ha, well, man of flowery   
  words, then you are stupid.   

   Because no one says no to    
   the great VD, especially     

    when VD is the director!    

         So I fire you!         

        Get off my set!         

     Sir Jeffrey: You think     
     having to leave your       

  little playground here,       
  your sandbox, is punishment?  

      (Sir Jeffrey laughs)      

       VD: Hey, don't let       
       the door hit your        

  flowery dick on the way out.  

      Sir Jeffrey: You're       
      not a hero, VD.           

      You're a movie star.      

            An icon.            

   That is not as               
   substantial or deep as the   

film your image is recorded on. 

   A vapid photon, glittering   
   for an ignorant audience.    

 I pity, really pity your fans. 

   I wish they knew what an     
   appalling effort it takes    

    to get your facade ready    
    to be photographed.         

       A photograph of a        
       facade that moves.       

      That is how I             
      shall remember you.       

    You cannot hear my no,      
    but you will hear the no    

    that life delivers you.     

    VD, you are the disease.    

      And you, and you          
      alone are the cure.       

           (applause)           

   (spacey teleporting noise)   

      VD: I am the disease      
      and I am the cure.        

That was my line, he changed it.

         He was joking.         

         Joke's on you.         

Burton: VD, where are you going?

       VD: I'll be back.        

       Burton: We have to       
       finish the movie.        

    VD: People are supposed     
    to say no to me,            

    you wanna say no to me?     

   Burton: Okay, umm, no, no!   

     You cannot leave set.      

         VD: Fuck you.          

          (sad music)           

        (VD hums softly)        

   Soundman: [unintelligible]   

    VD: You want to say no?     

             To me?             

        To the great VD?        

    You should say no to me.    

           (sneezes)            

          (Sue laughs)          

      VD: What, did I get       
      some on my face?          

      Burton: What, what,       
      what are you doing?       

   VD: My dick says no to me.   

     My dick says no to me.     

       Burton: Stop this!       

            Stop it!            

  (Burton mumbles in Russian)   

           (knocking)           

         VD: Who is it?         

    (answer in Russian, with    
    Maria understandable)       

           VD: Maria.           

           Maria: Hi.           

          VD: Hi baby.          

    What are you doing here?    

Maria: Well I wanted to get you 
something to remember me by.    

    VD: Oh thank you, Maria.    

    I didn't think maybe        
    you were gonna actually     

      go shopping for me.       

          What is it?           

      Maria: Well open it.      

            VD: Oh!             

           (laughing)           

       VD: You didn't get       
       this at a store.         

      Maria: No, I didn't.      

    Props had an extra one.     

           You like?            

           VD: Awwww.           

          I love you.           

 Maria: Awww, honey you know    
 it's not love, it's location.  

          VD: I know.           

     But it's still sad         
     to see you go anyway.      

    Maria: Aww, it was fun.     

           VD: Yeah.            

          Maria: Bye.           

           Have fun.            

   VD: I'll miss your tuckus.   

  Maria: I'll miss yours too.   

           VD: Maria.           

     AD: VD, I need you to      
     focus, are you ready?      

     VD: I was born ready.      

  Today is a good day to fly.   

  Today is a good day to fly.   

    AD: Alright, here we go.    

      On three, two, one.       

  VD: Oh, look I am Superman!   

             Ho ho!             

  And once again, I have saved  
  New York for the 47th time.   

           Ahh, wooo!           

      And I go woooooo....      

    Oh that's a nice rocket.    

           Director.            

           Director.            

   Now do I look like a fish?   

         Am I the fish?         

              Woo!              

    And now, I'm Super, not     
    yet I'm not Superman.       

             (thud)             

        (VD exclaiming)         

       Oh, we got hung          
       behind the rocket.       

             Okay.              

     Ivan: You think they       
     can keep hoisting him      

     right out of building?     

      Paint: Oh I think         
      they have something       

       even better than         
       even that planned.       

            VD: Woo!            

             Whoa!              

     That was a little bit      
     too fast there, Mark.      

 I'm a-spinning like that       
 little thing with the horses,  

         the round one.         

 I, I think the balance is off. 

      I'm a-stuck-ed here.      

    Uh, let's take me down.     

Mark: Hey, yeah we're on it VD. 

         Bring it down!         

    VD: It's uncomfortable.     

 I don't, I don't feel so good. 

     Oh, I feel all sweaty.     

       (gags and vomits)        

         (crew reacts)          

     VD: I told Louie I         
     did not want the fish.     

  Mark: VD are you all right?   

 VD: Okay I think I'm , I feel  
 better actually I'm Okay.      

        But get me down.        

       (gags and vomits)        

            Oh God.             

     I don't feel so good.      

      Oh God, my arm            
      hurts, GET ME DOWN!       

            My arm!             

           (gagging)            

          (sad music)           

    AD: Can we get him down?    

         VD, VD, here.          

        VD, talk to me.         

          Talk to me.           

    Mark: Get in here, come     
    on come on come on!         

  Ivan: That was a puke smell.  

        Paint: I think I        
        know what it is.        

          Ivan: What?           

      Paint: The uh, the        
      tattoo, the talons.       

          Ivan: Yeah?           

     Paint: I think it's a      
     straight shot into his     

    subconscious, he knows.     

          Ivan: What?           

   Paint: He knows that he      
   is controlled by his dick.   

   And his dick is controlled   
   by some winged thing         

     in the sky that he has     
     no control over, some      

    winged, whimsical beast     
    that has pulled him         

 and yanked him and the talons  
 are deep into his flesh,       

     and he can't control       
     it, and it's like he's     

telling his dick that he knows. 

  It's a concession of sorts.   

  He's conceding to his dick.   

     Ivan: He was blown out     
     of his mind and uh,        

       probably picked          
       the wrong picture.       

      Paint: No, he knows.      

      It's a recognition        
      of your own faults.       

     You know it actually       
     takes a lot of, he may     

have more insight than we think.

     You know, God damn,        
     the tattoo, I like it.     

     Son of a bitch knows!      

           He knows!            

    Mark: Can I get a           
    gurney in here, please?     

  Medic: Let's go, move it in.  

    Here we go, here we go.     

   Get him off, get him off.    

  Let's go, let's go let's go!  

Mark: How 'bout some help, Ivan!

        Mark: We got it.        

         Medic: Clear!          

 Ivan: Do you believe in karma? 

  Paint: Well, yeah, but it's   
  not often you get to see      

  the big wheel go all the      
  way around in one lifetime.   

   Ivan: I know you're          
   liking his tattoo, but uh,   

     he shits on everybody.     

 His wife, his children, he     
 probably shits on his own dog. 

          (sad music)           

  Burton: Hey, don't wrap up!   

      This is not a wrap!       

      We will shoot the         
      scene with doubles.       

         AD: Not today!         

       Burton: No no no!        

   Get his body off of here!    

     We are going to shoot      
     the scene with...          

            Sue: No!            

  Paint: Oh, now she says no.   

            Sue: NO!            

             NO!!!              

          (VD coughs)           

      VD: What happen-ed?       

  I was, I was Peter Pan,       
  and I was doing the flying,   

    and I saw Neverland, and    
    Tinkerbell was calling,     

       and there was the        
       fippy-fippy thing.       

 God my mouth tastes like       
 shit, could I have some water? 

         Louie: Water!          

  Mark: Louie's supplying it.   

      Medic: VD please,         
      just lay back down.       

       VD: Oh thank you.        

      Medic: We gotta get       
      you to the hospital.      

           VD: What?            

      Medic: We gotta get       
      you to the hospital.      

  VD: We have a movie to make!  

      Medic: VD, you just       
      had a heart attack!       

           VD: What?!           

 Medic: You had a heart attack.
