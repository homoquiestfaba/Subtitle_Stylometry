It's time for RiffTrax!

And it's not an easy job.

They watch movies and they make up jokes about them.

Tell their jokes to microphones.

Put the jokes into a file.

On a secret server deep beneath a  mountain.

Protected by a dragon.

Who ya gonna get to riff those tracks?

I don't ever pick tracks where the riffs are missing.

Why you always gotta pick RiffTrax?

Only RiffTrax picks all the tracks worth riffing.

On some other day.

Somewhere far away.

You put out wiener wraps and snacks.

You fluff the cushions on your couch and buy a TV.

All your friends come over.

Just imagine their surprise.

When you press play and then instead of just a movie.

They hear jokes! Professional jokes! By professional comedy professionals!

Who ya gonna get to riff those tracks?

I don't ever pick tracks where the riffs are missing.

Why you always gotta pick RiffTrax?

Only RiffTrax picks all the tracks worth riffing.

It's your lucky day! It's time for RiffTrax!

RiffTrax!


Now it's like everyone's into it. and the Toltecs are like SO over it.

Thank you Mary.

John Cody was probably the best known and

most talked about citizen in our community.


who screams nursery rhymes into the 7-11 dumpster.

Cruel jokes and local gossip.

Yet he maintained an air of quiet dignity throughout his life.

He lived alone on Totem Hill.

High school pranksters would often invade his property.

And many of the kids claimed they saw him practicing magic.

And ancient rites from dusk to dawn.


Cody admitted they were correct.

Claiming there are evil days of which one must

You didn't see his boat did you?

No.  But sometimes he doesn't come in down by the dock.

Well why don't that tightwad buy himself a car?

And better yet buy himself a garbage truck and haul this mess away?


Alright? Hell, it's inexcusable.

It looks like a refuse heap and smells like a fart.

Would you just look at this trash?

I wouldn't even take a dump in here.


Some of this stuff is so damn old.

I mean it just. Must have been at a damn sewer collection.

Just stinks.

What's the problem?


Sammy has got 50 houses to take care of and maintain and service and everything.

Hell it'll just calm down. It'll take a week to clean up in here.

And maybe longer if that inspector keeps giving Sammy other things to do.


They need to keep pouring it on.

Mr. Girard! Oh I'm sorry.

Ranger Girard, I mean we're not a bunch of government employees.

We're not. We don't get overtime adjustments like you do.


Tell what the snot burgers it is?

Well it's a symbol?

What?

An eagle.


Is a symbol of dark power.

Oh the dark power. That's scary.

I mean why is an eagle on top of the skull?


The dark power.

Oh that's just wonderful.

I mean WHAT would we do without an eagle?

White man broke all the other treaties with the Indians.

Why the hell didn't he break this one?


That's pretty.


â™ªâ™ªâ™ª


Some kind of indian burial ground? Uh whatever.

Pretty sure there's no harm in defiling those.


Well nothing about this has been done.

What have you been doing?

What do you expect?

Not much.


About to drive me crazy.

And there comes that damn Indian again.

Ever since I'd been taking care of this place for Cody

he's been sneaking around like a damn cat.


So he could take over the place.

Not gonna say you're welcome Girard.

I think I know why you're here.

Yes I think you do.



No more magic. No hocus pocus.

This land belongs to me now.


I was a very good friend of your grandfather's.

and he had some definite ideas about this land.

Yeah ideas that would do me no good.


This house should go to a bunch of old indian mystics.

I understood your grandfather's religion and faith.

And they lived in poverty.

This should be a luxury to them.


And all at no profit to me.

Your grandfather took good care of you David.

And when the treaty showed that he owned most of

this land around here, he shared with everyone.


Practiced rituals older than white man's America.

Cody should have bought a Mercedes and headed for Vegas.

Hell that's what I'd have done.


Not the most refined and eloquent of men.

Yet he speaks the truth.


What the hell? Ought to kick his red ass!


You know you're a very attractive girl Mary.


Prettier now than when I was a young man.

And then I get to thinking, no.

It's just harder for me to get to them.

I can't believe that YOU would have any problems there Mr. Girard.


Of course some girls might be a little crazier about whips than others.

You know about my whip?


needs to be SHUT DOWN immediately! (Kevin laughs)

All about the heroic forest ranger who goes out and hunts

down and corrals wild animals.


No one ever sees me.

Station did a story on you last month

Wasn't it a cougar?

Cougar, bear, wild dog. Doesn't make any difference.


To a cage.

And then you send the caged animal to the wild life resources department.


You're a good reporter.

I'm just fascinated by interesting men.


Toltecs I think.

Oh back to business.  The Toltecs.

A Mexican tribe.

Let's see. They existed about a thousand years ago.


The Toltec's gods and myths formed the basis for much of the Aztec religion.

And Aztec noblemen often claimed a (indistinct) from the Toltecs.


I don't know.  And?

The news department is in charge of a community affairs type show.

It runs at odd ball times on Saturdays.


Might be able to run parts of it on the morning news.

Might be a nice tribute to Cody.

Could be. And I emphasize could be.

I would show the proper respect for Cody.


and war paint are historically accurate.

Maybe this is our chance to do him justice.


I get their attention that way.

Is that about ready?

Yeah I think it is working now.

You're sure? We didn't lose anything?


Better not be any glitches on that tape.

Don't worry.

I haven't let you down yet have I?

Let's do it.

What about that green video last week?

Tapes rolling.


than Buckner heard about game six.

I think we were talking about the eagle symbol.

Yes eagles.

The eagles were the attendants of the gods of the daytime powers.


Four eagles?

There are four cardinal points on the compass.

And the number four is significant in American Indian culture.


Christian faith.

Now their ritual calender, is divided into four equal parts.

Each one corresponding.


The Toltecs.

Why was Cody so obsessed with the Toltecs?

They were from Mexico.

They didn't have anything to do with his heritage?


He and many of the elders of his tribe believed in age-old myths or legends.


Brutal and outcast tribe moved far north.

And they said to have moved close to this community.

But we're hundreds and hundreds of miles.

Don't give me a lesson in geography.


Such a move.

But Cody believed the legend.

And on this very ground.


That is, they worshiped from below.

Only the Toltec sorcerers were actually allowed to stand on the power spot.

Totem Hill.


They served the god of the nocturnal skies.

Who symbolize the destructive principles of the universe.

The dark powers.


If it's alright with David, I'll read Cody's diary.

There might be something in there that would help your story.


I mean help your story!

There is something you can do for me Miss Dalton.

Lunch, dinner?

My phone number?

No no. I was gonna tell you about the whip.


I think that might just be a little  bit out of my field.

Oh no. This is a gift from Cody.


Gathered from the four quarters of the world.

And it's said to have power to protect.


I would like you to mention the whip was a gift from Cody to me in your story.

A symbol of homage from you to the spirit of John Cody.

Beautifully put.


(bell rings)


Who hung himself out of boredom.

(bell rings)


Remember to vote God!

I'm afraid the preacher's sermon didn't do much to uplift your spirit Beth.

No it's not that.

It just that I hate the thought of trying to look for a new place next quarter.

I mean it's so much fun.


It was the best time in my life.

And I'm sorry, but I refuse to commute.

Hey you make home sound like torture in comparison.


and of course I had to get a high number.

Anyway 45 miles is too far away to commute.

Hey Beth! Heard you didn't make the cut.

Listen I'll let you borrow my pup tent okay?

You sarcastic little twerp!


Why couldn't I have been born an only child?

Lynn you'll be looking for a room too, won't you?

Yeah, but. I don't care. I mean I didn't like the girls in my suite anyway.


Hey yeah! Beth I think I know just the thing! Come on!

Mary!


Mary! Mary! Mary tell Beth about the house.

Hi! Beth!

How are you?

Just fine.  How long will you be in town?


Tomorrow afternoon.

You know newspeople never get any.

Tell her about the house Mary!


I think you might like it.

The owner died about a month ago. It's like new.

Really new. It's really big!

And get a lot of girls in there. Be just like a sorority house.

Great! Tell me more about it.


It has weathered wood on the outside, four bedrooms, sunken tub.


How did you find out about a place like this anyway?

Well I did a few news stories on him.

Yeah, yeah. Escorted by four indian sorcerers.


Garden. Indian sorcerers.

Yeah these four Toltec witch doctors types did some kind of magic.

Dark powers!



Well I hear that the landlord wants to dispel a lot of the myths so.

The rent should be low


Take a chance beth!

Come on! Take a chance!

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª


be a beige ranch bungalow with three windows.


â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Whoa.




Boo!

Hi Tammy.

Funny!


Girl you better watch out.

Honey Toltec sorcerers were bad dudes.

Tammy I never even heard of the Toltecs until Mary told me about the house.

You mean you didn't know about this place?


that runs at odd ball times on Saturdays? (Mike laughs)

Hey where's Susan?

She's in her room. You share?

Yeah but the owner wants two to a room. It's not that bad.

Come on. You'll love it. Come on!


You'll love it.

Already told Mr. Cody you were moving in and

can move in as soon as you pay your deposit.


Beth I really do feel like an outcast.

I mean this is the second year I didn't get a low number.


On everything. I mean my social life?

The total pits.

Beth I never dreamed I wouldn't get a room on campus this quarter.


Bring the men to where we are.

You talking MY kind of trash now lady!


Oh geez would you look at this?

You'd think she was getting ready for a date with Tom Selleck.


Tammy! Hey girl! How are you?

Fine and you?

Are you moving in today?

You kidding? The house on totem hill.

Uh oh. Come on, you'll love it.

Well that's what I hear. and by the look of this place.


So we got the big bedroom.

And you haven't even SEEN the fringe benefits yet.

Honey you're not gonna believe this.

Come on.


Bath.

Ooooo whooo!


Whoever stayed here was a really a Rockefeller in disguise.

Well no Tammy.

I think it just took it after the place was built.

Anyway come on. There's a lot more to see.


flip over the spray hose on the kitchen sink!


Would you check this cabinet space?


Oh wow.

Hey Beth.

Where are we gonna put all the beer I'm gonna bring?

Tammy you would think of that.


Okay great.

Oh we can take turns cooking huh?

Child. I make a mean lasagna!


Let me show you to your room.

Wait a minute Beth. All I said.

I know what you said Tammy. But you'll come around.


Downstairs you have own choice of bedrooms.

Honey it is definitely better than the dorm rooms.

Isn't that the truth!


Nice.

No sunken bath tub but it'll suffice.

And over here.


Are you kidding? I hate pool.

Susan's a recreational freak around here.

Did you know it took ten guys to bring this ugly thing in here?


Well I  like pool.

And here we have our own laundry room.

Complete with indian artifacts left by the previous owner.


I don't know. I haven't looked through it yet.

But I've never seen them look like this before.

See usually the eagle is set up on top of a skull's head,

and it symbolizes good or evil.


Honey I've heard a lot about this house.

That's why I'm not even for sure I want to stay here.


And it smells like a fart!


Hey! What did you think?

Well.

Oh come on you'll love it! It'll be great!

All the shouting about?


Tammy um, this is Lynn. Lynn this is Tammy.

Tammy Lynn Lynn. Tammy.








Cheapest place in town.

Best company in the world.

Lots of party room!


and definitely not 30 year old bank tellers.

Plenty of privacy if you happen to have a FRIEND.

MM hmm. (laughs)

See all you have to do is say yes?

YES! Don't rush her!


should act like a real human being."

She may have other plans or something.


her being such a crazy college student. And all?

Where's the phone?

Uh.

Well. One little item this house never had.



Electricity?  Tammy we have electricity.

Okay. Not even he'd like things that simple.

Come on. I'll show you where the nearest phone is.

What was that?

Hello David. How are you?

Just fine thank you.

I knew you'd be here today.

And I just wanted to come by and thank you

for telling your friends about the house.

Four of them moved in already,

and another tenant coming in this afternoon.


How do you think I'm doing?

Really interested in the story.

Sure come by anytime.

Good.

I think I left my note book in the court room. Will you excuse me?

Okay.


Mr. Girard what are you doing here?

Hi Miss Dalton.

I'm here three or four times a month.


Yes we just tried a fellow I arrested last month for shooting fish.

Shooting fish?


What can I tell you?

The story about the fish making so much noise he couldn't sleep.

That's ridiculous!


over the aged whip carrying park ranger!

Speaking of stories.

I was just talking to David Cody and I was thinking

about going out to the house to do a follow up.


I thought I'd thrill the audience by saying it again.

Might be something interesting.

Okay.

Right around here.

That's the old man!

Those WERE noisy fish!


Come for the lengthy dog whipping scenes, stay for the humor.

You know it's too bad you didn't come by here when you first started your story.

I've been keeping up on the Cody place since I started working here.


But they won't give in.

I'm a history/mathematics major.

So I'm kind of interested in things such as Totem Hill and  local legends.

Well you know.  This is interesting.

But it doesn't really tell me anything I don't know.


Find some interesting information.  Take a look at this.

What is it?

It was filed away with some government documents.

We got a whole file cabinet back there full of things pertaining to

federal investigations concerning this county area.


but doesn't tell you anything you don't already know. I'm your man.

See after he proved, that the treaties were still enforceable.

You mean after the federal courts ruled in his favor.


This is news.



He made a formal written request that the land be destroyed.

Uprooted, graded and that if any archeological

artifacts were found, they were to be turned over to the US Navy and buried at sea.


Kind of a thing we do around here.

Found that four Toltec sorcerers had buried themselves there several.


Why did he want everything dumped in the ocean?

The Toltecs believed that if they buried themselves alive.

Buried alive?


They hushed it up to try to keep from being embarrassed.

Anyway, about the legend.

These buried sorcerers fed on the blood of the living in order to remain alive.


Practiced all those dusk to dawn rituals to keep the Toltec sorcerers under control.

That explains it all.


Built on Totem Hill.

Cody went before the courts to get control of the property surrounding it.


Reimbursed the contractor and gave the house the house to Cody.

Of course the contractors were glad to get rid of the place.

Three of their workmen were listed as missing.

during the construction of the home.


Yes he thought that the Toltec sorcerers got them.

So my quiet unassuming friend, John Cody,

went before the government of the United States.

And demanded that they let him have control.


Wouldn't have asked for it if he hadn't thought he

was protecting the people that were laughing at him.

What a self sacrificing man he was.


(birds chirping)


I need to study for one of my many CLASSES I take at COLLEGE!

(knocks on door)

Susan?


Wake up sleepy head!

We have a workout today.

Oh god

I'm so sorry Paige. I forgot all about the time.


were sitting in your room dressed like that?

Go ahead and change.

Yeah sure.



not as good as I thought it would be.



Hmm. Those hip waders are cute!


Mm mm mm.

Who are you?

The question is.


Who are you? What are you doing here?

I know what I'd like to be doing here.

Look who in the hell are you?

And what are you doing here?


God must have worked long and hard to put you together.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª


Name's Craig. Craig evans. I'm Lynn's brother.

Lynn's brother?

Yeah.

Oh. Well I just wished she'd warn me that's she's gonna have a guest so I could.

Excuse me!


I'm a tenant.

A tenant?

Yes and I certainly look foward to our, seeing a lot more of each other.

Although I've seen quite a bit of you already.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª


character sneaking through the house.

Oh Beth.

Well  I'm falling in love with this place.

I told you you would.


Oh honey I love it!

Hey! So do I! And I just got here!

Craig, hello.


Craig this is Tammy.

Hi.

How ya doing?


The moisture oozing out of those half gloves is nothing you should ever touch.

Somehow I already knew.

Hey, uh.

Tell me more about the new girls moving in.

In fact, tell me about the young lovely upstairs.


School is three hundred miles away and I'm sure  you'll be quite busy.

Not at all. See, I'm taking the semester off.

My grades weren't too good you know.


Eliminating this guy from the planet and making sure he NEVER multiplies.

Gonna be here for some time.

No. From the looks of things I'm soon gonna be a very busy young man.


What do I look at?  The towel in background?

One of the many door jams? Really it's a symphony for the eyes.

Well end of the dream.

Always knew Lynn was a spiteful bitch.

But I never knew she's stoop this low.


God Susan, you wouldn't believe my day today.

I went to class and she has already assigned a project for tomorrow.

That's kind of early.


And then I went to the library and was gonna

get some work done I lost my notebook.

I don't know how I lost it in the library.

So I went


shredded three day old pork chop in there.

Came back here, thinking that the problems of the world were gone.

And then you found out about Craig.


Just relax and forget the problems of the world.

Uh you don't usually take a bath in the afternoon? (guys laugh)

Really need one.


We just got finished working out. Sorry.

Don't worry about it.

I'll just, take a shower.


Dance class. Gotta run.

Have you seen my sweats?

No I haven't seen them, sorry.

Maybe I actually hung them up for a change.


Ooo. We're running out of bubbles.


be erotic are just not making the grade for me.

You don't want some geek getting his jollies if he looks in.

We're so isolated out here it really doesn't matter.

Then again, now that Lynn pulled that little stunt.


Susan can I use your shampoo?

Oh hey, Susan's not back but I'm sure she won't mind. Go ahead.

Craig get out of here! What are you doing here?


Get out!

Well, hello again,

Excuse I just came in to flush down a few butts.

Didn't realize there were already a couple of butts in here.

Yeah.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Listen asshole!


Got that scum bag?



So you're both a math and history major?

That's uh, quite a combination.


Do you ever have any time for other things?

Other things?


Do you think she's pretty?

Yeah of course I think she's pretty.

I doubt she'd be interested in me anyway.

Besides I've never talked to her.


I'm interested. I'm interested.

I bet I could set you up with her.


My social life suffers working with a double major

and working down at the court house.

I never seem to have time to talk with people.

Like um.


Always in the right places, while others?

Need a little help. Like me.

I am a pretty good match maker.


That was me.

Alright sure. How are your calculations coming?

Oh yeah, um. I think my first guesstimate was correct.


to hate this kid, he just said "guesstimate".


Get some new footage from around the house.

Yeah it's too bad.

Would have made a great story.


still tuning into your station after a rerun of Green Acres.

Mm hmm.

Really ought to go out there and tell Beth.

She ought to know that we're doing a story but I don't think have time to drive.


Grandfather's passed away.

Yeah it does.

I'll call Mr. Girard.

He might have time to, drive out.

Good idea.



Craig can you drop me off at school?


I need a ride. Well how have you been getting to school?

Beth and Susan.  Well ask them.

We're not exactly speaking.

Tell you what, that bitch had better shape up.

Or I'm gonna teach her tail a lesson.


of people's history of the United States?

Wait a minute.  Dallas and Al are in school this year aren't they?

Yeah I wish they weren't. I can't stand them.

Okay okay. I'll give you a ride.

And I think I'll drop it on those two.

We might just have a little party here this evening.

Now Craig!

Put Susan's lovely butt in order.


Alan? UGH!

Oh get out of here and let me get ready will ya?

Bitch.


He wasn't home.  (Mike laughs)

Left a message with the service.

Uh that's too bad.


Oh I'm sure he would.

He'd be glued to his TV set.

You know I bet he misses Cody.

Yeah. You can see it in his eyes.


He has these really sensitive eyes.

Well I don't know about sensitive eyes.

But I do know that Cody is part of a world gone by.

And Girard misses him.


You don't think that Mr. Girard believes in Cody's legends do you?

No. But I do realize that there is some truth. In all legends.



And the fact is, according to fiction anyway, that

tonight's the night four eagle's dreaded most.


(music indistinct in background)


Hey man! Check it out!




Hey boss we got a hot balloon getting out of a truck out here.

What?


I want to drive your truck Uncle Earl.


beginning of the movie Uncle Earl!

This job I'll never know. (fart noise)

Sick Uncle Earl!


Worry anybody half to death.

Hey man! You're right!

The GoodYear blimp is at the door!


(music plays)

Hey sorry dude, but party's by invitation only.

My name's not dude.

Here to fix the toilet.


Hey Craig! You'd better tell your friend to bring his own beer.

No problem. Looks like he's carrying his own keg.


Just a couple of my friends come by to entertain the girls.

Entertain? Shit.

Hey like fix it good okay?

What do you think I'm gonna do? Fix it bad?


How did you come to be staying here?

Sammy thought these girls were supposed to bring other girls up here.

Well I kind of slipped in through a loop hole.


we can all celebrate" loop hole.

She's the one who called.

She said "you got to get over and fix this toilet right now!"


If those girls wouldn't be flushing their UNsanitary

napkins down the commode, wouldn't get stopped up anyway.


Your head's the only unsanitary thing that was clogging up the commode.


And if so where did he get his CURRENT head?



anyone who dares cross wits with Earl Coleman.

Listen I was sorry to hear about your brother being sick.

Well not as sorry as I am.

He forgets that too much fun to fixing toilets.


stupid should have gone to college face!

Proud to entertains such a handsome little guy!

Heh, entertain.

Understand these two guys in here want to entertain you.


Had music for an hour.

Mm hmm. Yelling or peering every five minutes.

See what they're really trying to do is intimidate Susan and me.

Well why just you two?

My color for one.


Kind of feel left out don't you?

Not really. Well I tell you one thing.

They come banging on my door and I'll stick all three of their heads in there.


Don't worry about those guys.

I'll get rid of them before I leave.

And the Indian, I'll talk to him tomorrow about what's his face.


Come on squirt.

I want to drive the truck!

Will you shut up about the truck?

You're only nine years old.

Nine year old is too stupid to drive a truck.


I got a lot of studying to do.

Me too.

But how can you with all this noise?


Hey Susan baby!

How about coming in here and modeling one of your little outfits for us?

You did what you wanted to do with his face.

Come on in and let us do what we want to do with yours!


Lay off that girl.

Why? you like her, man?

Come on let's think of some good watermelon jokes for mammy Tammy.

Yeah.


Damn! Ain't a thing wrong with this commode.

I don't understand why nobody can't fix nothing no more.


One of these days you're gonna go to college.

You'll study real hard.


Educated and everything.

And be embarrassed about how dumb your Uncle Earl is.



That's just fine.

But I'll tell you one thing.

If I ever catch you acting like one of them scrotum heads

down the hall I'll beat your buns with a weed eater.


Cletis? Cletis? Cletis? (engine starts)

Stop!


That kid went to pick us a six pack.

Hope you don't mind. Hot damn white trash.


Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!

Sounds like a stampede outside.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

All this partying's enough to wake the dead.

Craig!


If you're out there just STAY out there!

He's just not showing the appropriate level of enthusiasm for all this cabinet space.



Hey Beth.

Would you feel more comfortable if we bring your silverware in here with us?


I mean I'll just die if anything happens to it.

Not to mention what my mom will do.

Well let me take care of it.

Where is it?

I think it's in the cabinet underneath the shutters.

Anything else you want me to get while I'm there?


Gotta look out for. Uh.

You picked my weapon boy.

(cracks whip)

I'm the man with a whip.


Took you a thousand years to get here.

I'm gonna send you back where you came from.


(cracks whip)


If you can't handle that thing any better than that

We'd better do something else.


I understand you're indestructible.

(cracks whip)

I'm gonna cut you up in little pieces you.


But I'm pretty much out of quips.

(cracks whip) â™ªâ™ªâ™ª


(cracks whip) â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

(cracks whip)


Until at last they forgot what they were

Well Cody, it's over.


Knew were coming and passed.

The people will never really know the whole story.


Only God and you and I really understand it.

But I'll go on.

The afternoon and evening of my life is still to be lived.


Stay with me in spirit brother.


beyond the grave, we say so long to Lash LaRue.
