''MOUNT WU TANG''

''All alone, l travel to
the far side of the world

and think of the times
when you're with me

l hope one day l can
touch your face again

We'll go around the world

and care less about
what others say

All the troubles will seem
so far away

and we'll withstand all
the storms that come our way

This world is like one big circle

''NEW CROUCHlNG TlGER,
HlDDEN DRAGON''

Young Madam is back!

Father!

Good!

Lung, your horse riding skill
has improved a lot.

But you still don't know kung fu.

So try not to wander around so much.

l won't.

Your Excellency.

We spotted horse thieves
5 miles Northeast from here.

lt could be ''Dark Cloud''.

You go back first.

Let's go!

That could very well be ''Dark Cloud''.

Don't you want to go and find out?

No need.

But l want to go!

Go then.

Just don't call me Master
anymore when you return.

Then you'll have to find
a better student than me!

Lung!

Lung!!

So, it's only a woman!

Go!

Lung!

Lung.

Lung!

''YUK'S MANSlON''

You listen to me.

From now on, if you keep on
roaming around like this,

l'll break your legs!

Master.

The escorts from Hung Yuen have
arrived with Lu's gift.

l'm not marrying him!

Shut up!

You have no say in adult affairs!

Go back to your room, now!

Have some tea.

Old Master.

This is Master Yu from the
Hung Yuen escort.

This is our daughter's
teacher, Mr. Kao.

Greetings, Mr. Kao. l'm Yu Shu Lien.

lt's very accomplished
of you, Miss Yu,

to become the head escort
at such a young age.

You're flattering me, Mr. Kao.

Master Yuk

l brought a letter from Master Lu.

He wanted me to give it
to you in person.

Good.

What did Master Lu say?

He urged us to settle the marriage
between Lung and his son.

Looks like Master Lu is
more impatient than we are!

That's right.

lt'll be a peace of mind
for us too

once that crazy daughter
of ours is married.

Masters, l'll take my leave now.

lt's getting late, Miss Yu.

lf you don't mind, why not
stay over for the night

and leave tomorrow morning instead?

Then...

lf it's not much trouble.

Butler.

This way, please.

Please.

Take care.

She's quite a lady.

lf only our crazy daughter is
half as good as she is,

then l'll be content.

Master Kao.

How are you?

What are you talking about me now??

Was this vase meant for
your father, or for me?

Master Yuk scolded you

because, deep down inside,
he really loves you.

l scolded you precisely
for the same reason.

The world is dangerous
and full of trickeries.

But of course.

Master Yuk doesn't know that
you do know kung fu.

You're probably thinking that

if your father would've known
how good your kung fu is,

then he wouldn't be worrying
so much about you.

That's why you're mad at me,

because l told you
to keep it as a secret.

And now you're suffering
for it, right?

Lung.

You've always been living in this
ivory tower of your home.

You have no idea how the world
actually looks like.

What am l doing?

l'm talking to a deaf ear!

l shouldn't have taught you kung fu
in the first place!

Even if l would've wasted
such a talent like you,

at least it doesn't give me
as much of a headache

as taming a little shrew
like you now!

l...you're giving me a headache!

My bird! My bird!!

My bird!!!

Somebody, help! Help me catch it!

My bird!!

What is it?

Hurry, please help me catch the bird.

l'm begging you!

My bird! Hurry!

And my father wishes he has
a daughter like you!

l thought you're someone amazing.

Turns out it's nothing special.

You must be his third daughter.

That's none of your business.

''Lung, Master has to take care of
something important.

l'll be gone for a while.

Please don't miss me. Be a good girl.

Take care.''

Master!

Master!

Master!

Master, l know l'm wrong now.

You're never wrong.

Master, l will change!

l will behave.

l'm begging you. Please don't go!

You better mean what you said.

l, Yuk Jiao Lung, always
abide by my word!

Good.

l have to go to Baoding
for personal matters.

l'll be back in 3 months.

So Master is not leaving
because of me?

lf you break your promise
and keep causing trouble,

then l still won't come back.

Who said l'll break my promise?

That's good then.

Be careful on the road, Master.

lt's late. Go home.

You wrote this?

Your calligraphy has improved.

Master.

Why do you come and visit this
deceased master all the time?

Who was he?

l'm going now. Go home.

Master! You have to come back!

Why were Master's hands
full of soil?

''JUO WA SWORD AND
FlST STANCE MANUSCRlPT''

Get up!

Get up!!

Get up now!!!

GET UP!!

Miss.

Miss!

l think your horse is dead.

My horse!

My horse!!

Miss!

Who said l'm selling my horse?

MlSS!!

Hey, hey.

Hey!

Your jade emblem!

Wait!

Sorry, senior.

Did l scare you?

No.

Thanks for helping me back then.

No. You were frightened by them
because of me.

l should be the one apologizing.

That's all right.

l'm in a hurry. l have to go.

Fine. Take care.

What happened?

What really happened??

Father! Who killed our little brother??

What exactly happened at our home??

Why are there so many dead?

Father! Why aren't you
saying anything??

lt's not that l don't
want to tell you.

You're still young.

You shouldn't get involved with
some matters of our world,

because you'll have a hard time
getting yourself out of them.

Father! What's with you?

You're not like this before!

l don't care.

Little brother was innocent!

Shu Lien!

l understand how you feel,

and we must avenge for
our little brother.

But now is not the time.

There's still one very important
thing you have to do.

Master.

This will be our last escort.

Let's get this delivered.

An escort?! Now?

l'm doing this as a favor for
a very good friend of mine.

l've owed him much.

Now that l'm retiring
from the martial arts world,

l'm afraid l may never
pay back his gratitude.

That's why we must
carry out this escort.

Father! Tragedy has struck Hung Yuen

and our brothers' corpses
are still warm.

Now is the time for revenge.

Yet you want me to carry out
an escort instead?!

ls it because you want me
to stay out of this, father?

Shu Lien! What's with you??

Are you disobeying your father now?

But Father...
Say no more!

You have to carry out
this escort irregardless!

We will sever our ties if
you refuse to do so!

Then we will no longer be
father and daughter!

Fine, father.

l will go, since you insist.

l need a room, manager.

Sorry, but we're all full today.

Senior!

Little brother.

Senior. You sleep on the bed.

l can just sleep on the floor.

Get some rest.

l can't do that!

Just consider this as
my apology to you

for this morning.

Your Excellency. You're
personally leading the troops

to avenge our enemies this time.

We are forever grateful to you.

Let's get one thing clear.

My sole mission is to eliminate
rebels of the Bagua cult.

l have nothing to do with
your personal vendetta.

Yes...

Your Excellency is here for the rebels.

But this Yu Hung Yen is also
one of the Bagua leaders.

You must kill him first!

Don't you worry.

Once this is over,

just hand over the list of the names.

l guarantee you that Hung Yuen Escorts
will vanish forever!

Little brother. Your kung fu is not bad.

Where did you learn it?

l'm from Wu Tang.

Wu Tang?

You know someone
from Wu Tang, Senior?

Just one.

Why don't you tell me his name?

Perhaps l may know him.

Little brother. Can you do me a favor?

Of course, Senior. Just tell me.

l have a friend for whom l'm
taking something to Wu Tang.

Can you do it for me instead?

Sure.

Once l finish running errands
at the capital,

l'll take care of it for you.

There's no hurry.

Besides, l don't have the item yet.

l'll give it to you later.

My horse!

What are you doing??

l'm buying back my horse, lady.

Farewell!

My escort box...

Hey! Don't you run away!

Come back!!

Stop running!

How dare you stole my thing,
you rascal!

But l didn't.

This was my horse.

Give me back my box!

''TO MY LOVELY DAUGHTER''

''Shu Lien. lf, upon returning,

you find both your mother
and l are well,

that means l can really retire
from the martial arts world.

That will also mean we can all

live a quiet and peaceful life.

This has always been
my ultimate dream.

However, you can never leave
the martial arts world.

lf, by the time you come back,

you don't see me and your mother

then l only wish that
you will forgive me

for not saving our family.

But l must save you
and let you live.''

FATHER!!!

FATHER!!!

Father...

Quick! Someone is still in there!

Stop it, Miss Yu!

Get out of my way!

Miss Yu!
Get away!

Miss Yu!
Let me go!!

Don't be like this, Miss Yu!

You let me go!

Do not be blinded by rage.

You have to calm down.

l have to find the real
murderers and kill them all!

There's never an end to revenge.

You're not me. You wouldn't understand.

Miss Yu. Please listen to Mr. Kao.

Besides, this is your father's wish.

Sorry.

l unintentionally read the letter.

What should l do?

You still have a long road
ahead of you.

You should think about
what you can do.

Our Escort is destroyed,

and l'm now without a home.

You...

Don't you have any
other relatives?

They're all dead...

l have to find Uncle Meng.

Rebels! We're here to capture you!

Resist and you will die!

Stop!

They are not real soldiers.

l am Meng Wing Cheung.
Sorry for offending you.

The three of you are...

Uncle Meng!

Miss, you are...

l'm Yu Shu Lien.
Greetings, Uncle Meng!

You are Shu Lien?!

Never thought that
brother Hung Yuen

will die under the hands of
that evil woman Ho Gim Ngo.

You mean Ho Gim Ngo is
my father's killer?

lf my assumptions are correct,

then she must be the woman
Brother Kao saw at the inn.

Then why is there so much hatred

between Ho and the
Hung Yuen Escorts?

This started years ago.

Back then, me, brother Hung Yuen

and Ho's father Ho Fei Lung

were troubled by the officials'
ill treatment of the people.

We joined the Bagua Cult.

To avoid being captured
by the government troops,

we decided to separate.

Brother Hung Yuen learned kung fu
from the masters

and started Hung Yuen Escorts.

And l came here and
opened a teahouse.

What about Ho Fei Lung?

We never heard from him
after we separated.

At first, we thought
he had been arrested.

We found out later that
he had become a bandit.

He even tried to rob
your father's escorts.

Ho realized he is no match
to your father's kung fu.

So he used reunion as an excuse

to invite your father to his place.

He poisoned the wine.

But your father found out about
his plan and killed him.

Uncle Meng.

Are you saying that Ho came
to revenge her father?

Senior Meng.

ls there anyway to settle this?

Unless we take back the list
of Bagua Cult members

from Ho Gim Ngo and
kill her as well.

Right.

Let me stay here so we can
kill that witch together!

Miss Yu, no!

You stay out of this!

Miss Yu.

Can't you see what your father
had gone through for you?

Shu Lien, Swordsman Li is right.

Your father will be rolling
in his grave

if he knew that you plan to revenge.

Uncle Meng, then why are you
telling me the truth?

l now regret telling you
after seeing how you react.

Uncle Meng...

l know that, even if l
don't tell you the truth,

you will never give up,

because your heart will
always feel unresolved.

Shu Lien, let me take care of
that witch.

You must not linger here.

You should leave at dawn after
staying for the night.

Uncle Meng.

Why are you treating me
like an outsider?

Haven't you forgotten my marriage
agreement with your son?

This is the only place l can go.

Uncle Meng!

Shu Lien, Tze Chu...

He...

What about him?

He...

Old Master.

Please let me take Miss Yu
to see Young Master.

''FUNERAL TABLET OF
MENG TZE CHU''

Young Master came to the capital
a while back.

He was standing up for somebody

and offended the police troops
as a result.

Miss, l'm sure you understand

how unreasonable and arrogant
those police troops are.

Young Master got really mad
and fought with them.

He ended up being killed.

''YUK'S MANSlON''

l'm bored to death!

Why are you always acting crazy
like this, my child?

Are you possessed?

l am crazy.

l am crazy!

l am crazy! l am crazy!!

l am crazy!!
That's enough!

l am crazy!!

You'll get a good scolding
from your father

if he finds out.

l want him to find out!

l like seeing him getting
mad over me.

You better not make him mad now.

He's going into battle tomorrow with

someone by the name of ''Dark Cloud''.

He's really occupied.

Right Squadron, attack!

Charge!

Charge!

Left Squadron, attack!

Charge!

Kill!

Front Squadron, attack!

Kill!

Kill!

Miss!

Miss!

Miss! Where are you, Miss?
Where are you?

Your people are here for you.

You think l can't see that?

You better go.

Miss, where are you?

l don't need you to
tell me what to do!

See? She's over there!

Miss, are you all right?

Get the horse. Hurry!

Yes!

Let's go.

Yes!

She's not leaving the mansion
starting today!

Arrange for her wedding at once!

Are you all right, Miss?

Miss!

''JUO WA SWORD AND
FlST STANCE MANUSCRlPT''

Father, you should at least

cancel the wedding arrangement
between me and Shu Lien.

Shu Lien is a good girl.

Aren't you afraid
you'll have regrets

if you give her up so easily?

Life is never perfect to begin with.

l've made up my mind. Say no more.

You're leaving now??

Who goes there?

Ho Gim Ngo?!

Charge!

Are you all right?
l'm fine.

Let's go, Brother Ken!

Get that name list!

Go after them!

Brother Ken!!!

You will all die for
killing Brother Ken!

Fine. l'll die with you then!

Miss Yu!

Hold my hand!

Let go, Brother Li!

No!
l'll die with her!

l will never let go!

Brother Li!

No!

Pull! Use your strength!

Miss Yu! Are you all right?

l'm fine.

Are you all right?

l'm fine.

Sorry.

lt's all right.

Where's Mr. Kao?

He left. He had to go to Baoding.

What are your plans, Swordsman Li?

l have to deliver something
to the capital

on behalf of my master.

l must be going now.

Take care, both of you.

l'm responsible for
what they've done!

You should only catch me.

But of course, you must
first defeat me!

l sure will!

Then come on!

l'm not afraid of you!

You crazy woman.

You foul-mouthed, damn thief!

l'll kill you, you bastard!

Fine!

Enough.

l don't believe l can't win you!

Woman!

Woman!!

You're awake.

Enough of this.

Are you feeling better?

What's it to you?

Let go of me!

What if l don't?

You slime!

You heartless bastard!

Let go of me!

Getting your strength back, huh?

That means you must be fine now.

l hate you!

Do you really hate me?

Aren't you here to arrest me?

l...

l'm going back to the capital soon!

You take care.

Don't go!

Lo Xiao Fu! How dare you?!

Just because l like you doesn't
mean you can bully me.

Everyone dies.

l will have no regrets if
l die under your hands.

We'll fight our way out!
Yes!

Father! Mother!

Father, mother...

Brother Ken died a horrible death.

l want you all to die the same way!

Save my father...

Save my mother...

l don't want to be alone...

Please...

Don't leave me alone...

Don't let me be by myself...

Don't worry. l'm here.

The relationship between
Wu Tang and us

had deteriorated with the
appointment of their new leader.

But this time...

That's why there are no
eternal enemies in this world.

There are also no eternal friends.

Those who can be used
are our friends.

Those who can't are our enemies.

Are they trying to mend
bridges with you, Lord Beila?

ln the end, we're both
using each other.

However...l admire their sincerity.

Why's that?

They are sending one of
their students here

to offer me a precious gift.

They're only a bunch of Taoist monks.

What precious gift can they offer?

Green Destiny Sword.

''THE ClTY OF BAODlNG''

Brother Yang.

l'm sorry.

l hadn't been able to
take care of the matters

you bestowed upon me
before you died.

l promise you that l,
Kao Lang Chau,

will bring Xiao Fu here
to see you before l die

so he can give you his offerings.

You said the same nonsense
15 years ago.

Looks like you haven't
changed one bit!

Sister Lieu!

You disguised as a beggar

to avoid being captured
by the troops?

You took my manuscript back then.

Now is the time to return to me.

l don't know what
you're talking about!

Never thought a poor scholar
like you would actually

possess such good kung fu skills
in just 15 years!

Sister Lieu.

lt's not too late to repent.

Take care.

We have to get more of these
silk fabrics in stock.

Yes.

They're selling really well this year.

We can stock up a bit more.

Brother Meng!

Why can't you look at me?

Miss, l'm afraid you've mistaken me
for someone else.

Really?

l am not some Brother Meng.

My name is Chau Cheung Ching.

That's not it.

You're also the disfigured servant
at the Meng Mansion.

Uncle Meng gave me this.

Why aren't you admitting it?

l just want to know why.

You can annul our
marriage contract.

You can even discard
our relationship

and everything between us.

But you can't lie to me.

Shu Lien.

Please forgive me for being selfish.

Actually...

l've never forgotten
my promise to you.

l hate myself for doing this too.

Don't worry, Brother Meng.

l'm not here to force you
to honor our marriage.

l just want to know the truth.

Shu Lien!

Where are you going?

The world is such a big place.

l'm sure l can find
somewhere to go.

Take care.

Shu Lien!

Will we see each other again?

l don't think so.

Shu Lien, please stay.

What did you say?

lt's all my fault. Please stay.

Did you enjoy your visit
at the capital?

l would never have imagined
how the capital

has changed over these past years!

And l also had sugar-coated apples.

lt's delicious!

A lady of the mansion
eating on the streets.

Where have all your manners gone?

Good. Master Kao is back.

He's going to give you a lesson!

Master!

Did you run amok while l was away?

No! l'm not some wild monkey!

Master Yuk, Madam.

You must be exhausted, Master Kao.

l'm fine...
Kao Lang Chau!

Where do you think you're going?

You're not getting rid
of me so easily!

l'm staying with you for life!

You...!

Master Kao, she is...

She's my wife.

You damn scholar! How dare you!

What?

Do you want me to tell them
who you really are?

Should l tell Master Yuk
that you are indeed

the despicable, wanted
fugitive ''Jade Fox''?

You...

Master Yuk is the newly
appointed Viceroy.

So you better be careful and
don't do anything rash.

l want you to behave yourself
and stay here.

Then...

What about the manuscript?

l will give it to you
when the time is right.

You stole the
''Juo Wa Manuscript''!

l didn't!

You really didn't?

l'll be damned if l lied to you!

Fine!

Are you still denying it?

l wouldn't have stolen it
if you taught me.

Still so arrogant?

l must teach you a lesson!

Master.

Give me back the manuscript!

No!

Why wouldn't you behave?

Because l'm not content!

l have to learn it!

You're not qualified to learn it
because of your temperament!

Why can't l learn it?

You're too wild.

Just like l didn't want to
give the manuscript

to ''Jade Fox'' years ago.

lt will only beget more ills.

Jade Fox?

Master, so you know Jade Fox?

She's your master's wife.

She?

She's Jade Fox?

But she's really not my wife.

She's here to take back
the manuscript.

So this manuscript belongs to her?

No.

lt belongs to a Wu Tang
master, Jiang Lan Huo.

Was he the one whom you
always pay respect to?

You...

Brother Jiang told me that

he had always suspected
his wife Lieu.

She's been eyeing the manuscript.

So l've decided to hide it.

This manuscript only has
the external stances.

Lieu's talent and skills
are limited.

lf she learns it, then she'll
only damage her own body

and take herself on to the
path of self destruction.

Master, then can you teach me
the internal stances?

No way!

Why?

lt was greed that caused
your own master

to steal the manuscript from Lieu
and learn it for himself.

Even if my kung fu is now superb,
l feel like a thief.

Always living in fear.

The more my kung fu improves,
the more guilt l feel.

ln the end, l had to retreat
to the deserts.

Lung.

Let's forget about all this and

return it to the rightful owner.

Master, you want to return it
to Wu Tang?

Yes.

No!

Lung! Why wouldn't you
just listen to me??

Master.

l've already experienced
such superb kung fu.

l won't be content if you
want me to turn back now!

Greetings, Uncle Tak.
l'm Li Mu Bai of Wu Tang.

What can l do for you?

l'm a friend of Yu Shu Lien.

She urged me to visit you
once l'm here in the capital.

l knew what happened
to Brother Hung Yuen's family.

Now she's the only one left.

How is she?

She's already found someone
who can give her

happiness for the rest of her life.

Morning, Madam Kao.

Morning.

What a pretty bird!
Let me tell you, this bird...

Talk!

Where's the manuscript?

What are you talking about,
Madam Kao??

Stop pretending!

That master of yours must have
taught you kung fu!

No!

Master only teaches me literature
and calligraphy!

You...

You better stop lying
or l'll kill you!

lt hurts, Madam Kao!

Let me go!

Still think you can fool me?!

l really don't know kung fu, Madam!

l really don't!

Dammit!

Miss!

Miss!

Old Master.

What nerves!

Who dares to hurt Lung
in my own house?!

l'm not going to spare that person!

The maid told me that,
when she saw Lung,

only Madam Kao was with her.

lt's her?

Father...

Lung!

Lung!

Madam Kao has nothing to do with it.

Then...

l was trying to catch a bird,

so l climbed up the tree, and...

ls that so?

Master.

How are you doing?

Master, it's all my fault.

l better return this
manuscript to you.

You...

You're right.

This manuscript is
nothing but trouble.

l think Jade Fox is not
going to let me go easily.

Her kung fu is not
as good as yours.

No matter what, she's not
going to give up.

Besides, l was only doing it for fun.

Forget it.

How could you bully someone
who doesn't know kung fu?!

l was wrong then.

But you can't blame me
for everything!

Had it not for you,
l wouldn't have done it!

So is this really all
you want after all?

That's Jiang Lan Huo's
Juo Wa Manuscript!

Just take it and leave!

This is too easy!

l'm afraid you might
offend Viceroy Yuk

if you keep rippling
the water here!

A scholar will always be a scholar.

Just mind your own business!

Fine, l'm going.

Then go!

Madam Kao.

lt's you!

lt's late. Where're you going?

l...

You are leaving?

Yes.

l've told you.

l'll leave once l have finished
my business here.

That's all you have on you? lt's cold.

Take this.

Take care, Madam Kao.

Please come back often.

Wait!

You know something?

l'm not some ''Madam Kao''.

l'm a bandit.

Really?

So don't be so nice
to just anybody.

Do you understand?

Madam Kao!

What is it?

Do you know someone by
the name of Lo Xiao Fu?

You know him?

He told me there's someone
who calls herself

''Jade Fox'' that knows
who killed his father.

You little fox.

l almost fell into your trap.

So you're just like
all the others.

You just want to use me.

Madam Kao...

You know something?

l'm not going to tell you.

l want to leave a bait,
so that l may use you

when you need me later.

Do you hate me?

l hate you!

l hate you...

Hate you...

Dammit!

Catch her, father!

We have to revenge for mother!

Father!

Father!

Father, are you all right?

l'm not marrying a bandit.

Why?

l'm a Viceroy's daughter.

Even though my father is no longer
commanding the frontier,

l still can't associate myself
with the notorious ''Dark Cloud''.

Even if my father doesn't object,

other officials will
still suspect that

he's conspiring with bandits.

You're you, and your father
is your father.

Why does it matter?

Who cares where you go
once you leave him for good?!

Leave him for good?

l can't do that.
That wouldn't be filial.

You can't do this and
you can't do that.

So do you love me or not??

Do l love you?

You should know by now.

Damn bandit!

Then come with me!

l can't!

l don't care!

You're being silly now!

What's with you, woman?

l'm not following you!

So it's all because
l'm a bandit, isn't it?

Yes.

Fine!

Then l won't be one anymore!

l'll sever my ties
with my brothers tomorrow,

then l'll come back for you!

You really mean it?

We should split here, woman.

No!

Let's go a bit further.

Then go back with me.

No way!

Are you leaving now?

Then give me a kiss.

ln your dreams!

You should go back now.
