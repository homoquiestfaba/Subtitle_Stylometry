<i>...this is a busy time.</i>

<i> So, if you wanna shop...</i>

<i>Maybe a pedicure.</i>

<i>A pedicure?</i>

<i> Okay, that's where
we draw the line. That's it.</i>

<i> But in any event,
go to today.com</i>

<i> for all the rules
and regulations</i>

<i> and what you need to do,
'cause I'd love to come</i>

<i> and wake up with you.
All right.</i>

<i> Breakfast, tractor driving
and shoveling...</i>

<i>Hey, big Boston Marathon,</i>

<i> 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

<i> The wheelchairs go off
by noon.</i>

<i> Temperature about 50.
Partly sunny.</i>

<i> 3:00, 55 degrees
and light winds.</i>

<i> It's gonna be a perfect day.</i>

<i>You know,
there is a renewed hope</i>

<i> for the Red Sox
after two of the last plays...</i>

Here we go, John.
Feeling good about this year.

You said it.

Go Sox.

Seriously?

Hey, Tom! Don't spray.
I'm walkin' through here.

What's that smell?

Shit.

Ah! Shit!

What'd you do?

<i>I'd been checkin'
on the timer,</i>

I didn't turn on by mistake,

so I didn't hear the noise,
I didn't hear the beep.

And if you hear the beeps,
then you'd be able

to stop 'em...

You're supposed to

clear the roasters before
you empty the trash, Jeff.

...'cause I didn't hear
the beeps.

Okay, Maya, I'll sign off
on an hour of OT,

so Jeff can help clean up.
Does that work

for both of you guys?

Actually, sir, there's...

I got something I gotta do.

What do you got's
so important...

You just make
this big mess

and leave me here
to clean it up?

Look, the Sox lost
two in a row

because of me, all right?

I missed both games
because I was at work.

I wasn't in my lucky seat
with my lucky beer.

You got a lucky beer?

Yeah, I mean, I just...

Beer in general's lucky,
right?

Okay, this is your call, Maya.

All right.

I got you. Look at you.

Thank you, Maya.

You owe me.

Do me a favor, sir.

Don't report
our office romance, okay?

I know it's against
Costco policy,

but sometimes you gotta
make a sacrifice, right?

Please go
watch the game.

Here's my baby boy.

Can I get another pitcher?

Don't you think

he's gettin' too skinny,
Patty?

And he needs
a fuckin' haircut.

Friggin' perfect.

Look at that face.

The face is cute.

Shit!

Oh, Ma, hey.

She's good.

Careful, there.

You wanna sit somewhere lower?
That fall's a doozy.

Yeah, you go
fuck yourself, sweetie.

All right, thanks. Hey.

He's my favorite nephew.

Jesus, Jeff,

you still smell like
fuckin' chicken carcasses.

Buchholz is on fire.
Look at him.

He's a fuckin' beast.

That coulda been you, D.

On TV. Rich and famous.

Yeah.

Quit pitchin' in high school
like a fuckin' pussy.

You're a pussy.
Shut up, faggot.

Nobody says "faggot"
anymore, D.

Oh, really? What do you
know about it, huh?

What do you mean?
I'm down with the homos.

My boss at Costco's gay.

Your fuckin' boss?

You think
I get this fashionable

without it's some sort of
fuckin' insider help?

For the record, hey...

For the record,
I didn't pussy outta shit.

I had a herniated disk.
You both know that.

Shut the fuck up,
both of you.

You're an asshole. Shut up.

Who you callin' a faggot,
Derek?

No, apparently we don't say
that word no more, Uncle Bob.

You know,
Jeff's boss is a gay.

What? He is!

Where have you been?

Not with
the rest of us, apparently.

Bauman? You havin'
a stroke or somethin'?

Oh, shit.
Look who's here.

Hey, give me a second.

Nobody wants to fuck a guy
with chicken in his hair.

Why you touchin' my hair,
Uncle Bob?

Come back after she tells you
to go fuck yourself, okay?

Sit down
and watch the game, bro.

She broke up with you.

Hey.

Hey.

Are you...

What?

Are...

The sister's here.

Who? Gail?

Yeah.

She looks good, though.

Hey.

Hey.

I, like... I texted you,

like, six times.
You never get...

Did you get my texts or not?

Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah, I got 'em.

Cool.

Hey, Gail.

Jeff.

So what are you two
Amesbury ladies

slummin' it here for, anyway?

I'm collecting donations
for the Marathon.

No shit?

Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

All right.

Yep.

You got a jar, huh?
With pictures of yourself.

That's so great.

So you show people
pictures of yourself

and then you ask for money.

Yes. It usually works.

That's very...
That's a smart idea.

It feels like
you're self-promoting.

That's really...

I am. That's literally
what I'm doing.

Yeah, but you know what?
Like, if you try and pass this

around with
pictures of yourself,

it's gonna be like, it's...

You shouldn't do that.
You need my help.

I already got...

You're gonna need
inside help.

Oh, really?
Gonna give money or what?

No. Hey! Listen up!

Hear ye! Hear ye!

Give me a heart attack.

Citizens of Chelmsford!

Oh, no, no, no.

Citizens of Chelmsford!

Jeff. Jeff.

This young lady here
is running the Marathon

for Brigham and Women's
Hospital. Okay?

Where she also works
as a big-shot administrator.

So skip a round o' Stella,
ya fat fucks!

And donate to a good cause.

Yeah!

Hey, listen.

Put your moolah
in the fishbowl.

Just a couple o' bucks.
All right?

Here ya go.

She'll take food stamps...

Stop smiling!

...Chuck E. Cheese
tickets, whatever you got.

You are such a...

What?

Whoever thought
you'd end up being in, like,

this torrid melodrama with
a chicken roaster from Costco?

What do you have
against him? He's a nice guy.

You broke up with him
three times. Real nice.

Erin! E.

E, E, E, E!
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.

Can I come cheer ya on?

Why don't you
run it with her, Jeff?

Well, you know,
I suffered an injury

from a chicken-related

industrial accident today,
Gail, so, you know.

But, hey, I'm gonna be there
at the finish line for ya.

Don't the Red Sox
play tomorrow?

So?

So?

I'm gonna make
a big sign for ya!

I mean, that's gotta be worth
at least a dinner, right?

Bye, Jeff.

No, come on, I mean it!

I mean it. Hey,
I'm gonna be there,
all right?

Take care
of your finger, Jeff.

Hey, I'll be there, all right?

Dinner's pushing it!

You're gonna win it all!

E. E!

So lunch it is?

Oh, yeah. Go Sox.

It's too high.

God. Never again.

Jeffrey!

What, Ma?

Will you get me
some aspirin?
'Cause I can't reach.

Is there a...
You have an orange marker?

Ma!

Yeah!

There's an orange marker.
It was right here.

Don't make me shout, baby.

Never mind.

Tiny mice
with big hammers in my skull.

I can't reach the aspirin.

Ma, it's on the...

I'm gonna be late.

My God. Why do you
always put it up here?

Who puts it up here?
I don't understand.

Thank you, baby.

It's a new one. Yeah.

Okay. All right.

Hey, Can...
Can you fix the chirpy thing?

What?

Chirpy chirp.

What? You mean the low battery
alarm on the smoke detector?

Yeah, it's driving me
bat-shit crazy.

That's not a long drive.

You can't have
Uncle Bob come by

and do it on his way to work?

Jesus Christ.

What you got there?

It's just a thing.

I don't know why you keep
tryin' with that girl anyway.

Hey, wait,
I made breakfast.

<i>More than 27,000 runners</i>

<i> are running in today's
Boston Marathon.</i>

<i> The race is just now
getting underway.</i>

<i> More than
half a million people...</i>

Oh, that's your brother?

What's... What's his name?

Go Chris!

Is that guy runnin'
in his underwear like that?

What's that about?

Ah!

<i>Coming up in a big plume.</i>

<i> We're hearing from one of</i>

<i> our producers
there on the ground</i>

<i> that it was this large bang
on one side of the street.</i>

<i>What are they trying to do?</i>

<i>Erin, are you okay?</i>

I'm fine. I'm fine.

<i> Where are you?</i>

Just a bar.

I don't know...

<i> How are you gettin' home?</i>

I dunno.
My stuff is all back...

<i> Thank God you're okay.</i>

Yeah. At the buses.
It's back at the buses.

<i> How are you gonna get
your car keys?</i>

I dunno.
I don't know how to get there.

<i> Stay where you are.
I'll come find you.</i>

Yeah.

<i>At least five,</i>

<i> six people hurt.</i>

<i>Where can I meet you?</i>

<i>But I have a feeling
there are more.</i>

<i>Where can I meet you?</i>

<i>The photos, injuries to those</i>

<i> in the blast area
are quite severe.</i>

<i> Just a tragic scene here
in Boston today.</i>

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

Yeah, hello.

It's Patty, yeah.

And you know
they would've told you

if he was dead, right?

How do you even know that,
Karen?

You know I spent
my fair share of time

in a goddamn hospital.

Well,
this ain't about you!

Didn't say it was! Jesus!

Will you two stop?

They're gonna be
calling our name.

You can't right now,
you can't.

Where's my son,
God damn it?

What the hell happened?

Oh, Jesus Christ!

Where is he? Patty?
What's goin' on with my son?

Calm down.

Don't tell me what to do, Bob!

Patty, what's going on
with my son?

We don't know yet.

Bauman family?

Yes!

Bauman!

Yeah, we're with...

We're with Jeff Bauman.

Right here. We're his family.

Mr. and Mrs. Bauman?

Yeah.

Mmm. Yes.

I'm Dr. Kalish.

Jeff's alive.

Your son's alive.

Yeah. All right.

Thank you, thank you.

So, Jeff came in bleeding
with tourniquets on both legs,

and he was intubated
right away

and then
brought up immediately

<i> to the operating room.</i>

Hi.

I'm looking for Jeff Bauman.

Um, you're gonna
have to sign in here.

Put his name here and
we'll find out where he is.

Um, can you tell me if
he's at this hospital, please?

I... I can't tell you.

I saw a picture.
I know he's at a hospital.

I just don't know which one.

Please go to the waiting room

and I'll get you in here.

Can you please just
tell me what floor he's on?

It's crazy right now.
I will help you.

<i>Jeff underwent a double</i>

<i> above-the-knee amputation.</i>

<i> Most of the destruction had
actually already been done</i>

<i> by the bomb below the knees,</i>

and it was very obvious
to all the surgeons involved

that there was no way
to salvage anything

below the knee.

We had to get higher than
the knee to get clean skin,

clean muscle, clean tissue.

Oh, my God.

I gotta get
something to drink.

Um, do you want me
to get you a Coke,

or chips, or something?

<i>As they look through all these</i>

<i> little pieces, Brian,
they think the bomb now</i>

<i> was made
by putting the components</i>

<i> inside a pressure cooker pot.</i>

<i> And in there were nails,
BBs and ball bearings</i>

<i> to magnify the destructive</i>

<i> and injury-causing nature
of the blast.</i>

<i> And the explosive
was gunpowder.</i>

Some guy asked me

if my son is still unconscious
while I'm takin' a leak,

and I'm supposed to know

this freak
is a fuckin' reporter?

It ain't suspicious to ya?
A stranger chattin' it up

while you got your dick
in your hand?

Jenny, I was washin' my hands.

Shut the fuck up! You're
fucking yelling about Jeff!

Ah, Jesus...

Stop talking about her son!

He's my son, too.

It's hers.

Shut up.

What do you want?

I'm so sorry to intrude.

You're another
reporter, aren't you?

Don't let him in, Jeff.

I'm sorry, I'm, um,
looking for Patty Joyce.

I'm Patty.

Did you not hear us?

I'm Kevin Horst. Uh...

Who?

I'm Jeff's manager at Costco.

Check his ID.

These reporters
will try everything.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're... You're Carl, right?

Yeah, Jeff talks about ya.

Well, ya heard
what happened, huh?

Yeah.

You know our son
lost his legs, right?

I know.

And you brought breakfast?

That's not helpful.

Uh, thank you very much.

Maybe we should
wait to eat 'em

so you can go
grab your camera.

Take a picture
for your Costco newsletter.

I'm... Really, I'm happy
to bring whatever you like.

What could you
possibly get us

that we need right now, Kevin?

Well, I took the liberty
of printing up...

A fucking joke.
You kiddin' me?

...his policy
and I've highlighted the areas

that you'll need to sign.

Don't sign nothin'
without a goddamn lawyer!

Can you just let him talk
for a second?

Who are you again?

Yeah, shut the fuck up
and let him talk.

What's he gonna say
that we need

to hear right now?

I don't know.

Okay, answer me this.
Answer me this.

My son makes it through this,
where's he gonna work, Kevin?

Where's he gonna work?

Hmm? You gonna hire him back?

Jesus Christ.
We need this right now?

Yes, we do!

Who's gonna hire him
without any legs, Patty?

We can't
rehire him, sir.

See? I told ya.

Mr. Bauman, please,
let me finish.

We can't rehire him,

'cause he'll never have
stopped working for us.

We're not letting Jeff go.

And these... This is stupid.
But this is just...

You know, this is just to
get the insurance goin'

and get that rollin'.

Wait, insurance?

Yes.

Jeffrey has insurance?

Of course, of course. Um...

Plus legal, mental health,
or financial advice

for Jeff or any member
of the family.

And I've included
my personal cell

at the top there. Um...

All right, good.

Good, I'm glad you guys
are doin' the right thing.

So, what kinda
muffins we got there?

<i>All of those things happened</i>

<i> in preparation for this event.</i>

<i> But there was
no specific intelligence</i>

<i> that anything
was going to happen.</i>

<i> At this point in time,
it's too early</i>

<i> to get into the specifics.</i>

<i> These were powerful devices</i>

<i> that resulted
in serious injuries.</i>

<i>Do you have
someone in custody?</i>

<i>Those reports are not true.</i>

<i> There is no suspect
in custody.</i>

<i> We're questioning many people,</i>

<i> but there is no one in custody
at this point in time.</i>

Jeff?

Holy shit. Are you awake, bro?

You hear me?

Okay. Okay, okay.

Uh, so I gotta tell ya,
there was an explosion.

And your fuckin' legs...

They're gone, bro.

What are you doin', buddy?

I can't tell what
your fingers are doin'.

What, you wanna
write somethin'?

Hold on.

Here, buddy, here.
Here's a pen.

Yeah, grab that.

Erin? Erin, yeah, she's fine,
she's here. She's...

The whole family's here.
Everyone's down the hall.

You okay? How you feelin'?

"Lieutenant Dan"?

<i>You mean the guy from
Forrest Gump with no legs?</i>

Oh, shit. Don't move.

Bob, Bob, wake up!

What the hell, D?

Jeff's awake.

Huh?

He wrote this.

The last part.

Holy shit.

What happened? D?

He's awake.

Where's the FBI office?

Bob.

Hey!

Bob.

Hey!

Bob.

Hey!

Hey!

Jeffie.

Cut it down, guys.
This is just...

Jeffrey? Hey, baby.

Oh, my God, we are so happy
you're back with us.

Uh... Um, now listen,

some of the FBI guys
are gonna come in.

They're gonna ask ya,
y'know, a... A few questions.

So... Okay?

And all ya gotta do is
just tell 'em what ya saw.

That's great.

We're removing
the intubation tube.

We need everyone to clear out.

But we just got...

We'll be back.

We're just getting ready to
take the breathing tube out.

See ya later.

It'll be okay.

Let's go. Let's go.

We gotta get
that tube out, okay?

You ready, buddy?

What's wrong, bud?
You want her?

Yeah. I'mma let her stay.
It's okay.

It's okay.
You're all right, buddy.

Relax, okay?

All right, we have
a couple minutes of hubbub

before we get the tube out.

Open your mouth. We just gonna
clean your mouth first.

Then we're gonna get
that tube out.

Relax. Lemme just take off
some tape. Perfect.

Slow breaths.

We have a cuff link.

Here we go, bud. Ready?

One, two, three.
Take a big breath.

Big breath, big breath.

Big breath.

Take a big breath.

Okay. Relax, relax.

Slow breaths. She's just gonna
suction your mouth again.

Slow breaths, bud.

Good job. Can you say "Hi"?

Hi.

Okay, good job, good job.

We're gonna put
this mask on.

Put that on. Relax.

All right.
You can talk to him,

but he can't answer you, okay?

Okay.

Yes and no.

Okay? All right, buddy.

Great job, great job.

Good to go, kid.

Hey, E.

Mmm?

You're sittin' on my leg.

Oh.

Hi.

Hi.

No talking. No talking.

I'm a tough guy.

No talking.

I know you're tough.

Is he in there
tellin' 'em
about the bomber?

Yeah, I think so.

Fuckin' miracle.
My boy. Fuckin' hero.

You bet.

Sorta the same
kinda build,

but, like,
maybe a little taller.

But I looked him
right in the eyes,

so he's the same...

Was he young or old?

Yeah, he was young.

Yeah.

<i>What do you remember
after the blast?</i>

<i>Uh...</i>

There was, like, this smell.

Like, it smelled like...

Take your time.

Like the Fourth of July.

<i>...is now, in fact,</i>

<i> we know, dead.
All right Dr. Schoenfeld,</i>

<i> thank you so much
for joining us.</i>

<i> We really appreciate it.</i>

<i> Obviously, Dr. Schoenfeld,
limited by what he can say</i>

<i> because of the situation,
obviously,</i>

<i> this huge manhunt
being watched worldwide.</i>

<i> An individual,
Suspect Number 1,</i>

<i> now dead, we know.</i>

Fuckin' A!

Oh, my God!

You son of a bitch!

Kill that
other son of a bitch, too!

Jeffrey, I just met Carlos.

He's the guy
who saved your life.

Would you
like a coffee?

I brought some...
I've got some coffees.

Don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

I think everyone
in that hospital

is thinking
that same thing.

Yeah.

We broke up
about a month ago,
me and Jeff.

It's not the first time,

but we usually
get back together.

Not this time?

Doesn't show up
for anything.

He's always late.

You know, he...
He never wants
to leave his apartment.

I'm just fed up
with it.

And then he shows up.

<i>Sounded like
multiple assault
rifle shots to me.</i>

<i>FEMALE REPORTER: 8:15 p.m.
A person is cornered</i>

<i> on a boat in a yard
in Watertown.</i>

<i>A suspect in the boat.</i>

<i>Hundreds of law enforcement...</i>

Hi.

Jeff, how you doin'?

So, Jeff, we have to do

the first dressing change
today.

Okay, we're gonna take
these bandages off.

I'm not looking.

Things get
too rough, please let us know

and we can figure out
how to help you.

I'm sorry?

And did you
already pre-medicate him

for the dressing change?

Yep.

He's already gotten his oxy
and his dilaudid PO.

He has a PR in fentanyl
for breakthrough.

And I have plenty
in my pocket.

Now some
people like to look.

Some people
don't like to look at all.

No.

I don't wanna
look at me now.

So, Marion, if you
can hold up the right leg...

Okay.

...that would be very helpful

and we'll unwrap 'em now.

All righty.
I'm gonna just lift ya up.

You're gonna feel my hands.

I'm sorry, hon.

So I'm just
taking the tape off

and I'm gonna unwrap
the Ace bandage first.

This shouldn't be too bad.

But if you have
any sharp pains
or anything,

please let me know.

All right,
you're gonna feel my hands.

Tell me if you're ready.
Did that kick in yet?

Doing okay?

Yeah, yeah.

All right.

Almost done with the gauze.

Fuck.

You okay?

Yeah.

You let us know
if you need a break, okay?

You're okay.

Don't look at 'em.

I'm not lookin' at 'em.
Lookin' at you.

Okay, now
this might be a little sticky.

God!

Doin' great.
Doin' great.

You're doin' awesome.

Okay, the dressing's off.
We'll give you a minute.

Nice little breaths.

Good job.

In your nose,
out your mouth.

You're doing so great.

That was the worst.

Getting the dressings off
is the worst.

Want a little
more fentanyl?

Okay.

'Cause now we're gonna

take off the dressing
on the left side, okay?

Yeah.

You mind going
over there, Marion?

We're just gonna set up.

We're not touching
anything yet.

We're just settin' up.

Just gonna shimmy
this down a little.

Okay. All right, I'm gonna
lift up, one, two, three.

You're gonna feel this again.

Pretty much
just like the other one.

Cock!

Sorry, hon.

You're okay.

I have the fentanyl
in my pocket.

Do you want me
to give you that?

Yeah, yeah.
Let's give that to him.

All right,
we're gonna take a break.

We'll give you
some more medicine.

Okay,
let me just get to...

I'm just gonna
work around you,

so I'm just gonna
get to my IV.

We're almost done.

Now, same thing,
dried blood, big pull.

One, two, three.

One, two, three.

That's it, that's it.

Right here.

Hey.

Hey.

Was I asleep?

Yeah.

A good two hours.

You need a haircut.

No shit.

Mmm-hmm.

You need to wash it.

No.

Yes.

No.

Yes.

Still smells like...

You should have seen
the sign I made for ya.

What'd it say?

Had, like, 3D letters
and everything.

Hey.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Don't say that.

I'm so sorry.

Hey.

Don't say that.

You don't owe me anything.

Yes! Yes!

What's that?

I don't know.

Maybe they caught
the other guy.

Bye, Jeff.
We're so proud of you.

<i>...hours ago</i>

<i> now seems to be finally over.</i>

<i> The last suspect
being searched for, police...</i>

<i> According to
Boston Police Department...</i>

It's nice
they turned out for ya.

I think... I think he wants
to do it himself.

Yeah, okay.

I'm gonna lock you off,
honey. I'll lock you off.

Hold on. Okay.

You just let me know
if you wanna...

Thanks, Kevin. Thanks.

Take a picture
with Erin for us.

You look great.
You did that great.

Does it feel good
to be going home?

Is Carlos Arrendondo

your guardian angel?

They hated each other

and that's why
Pete got busted for it.

'Cause Bob was using
his computer.

And Pete didn't rat him out.

And he... He almost
had to go to jail for that.

It was in the papers
and all that.

Hey, listen, look at this.

Hey.

Ain't that somethin'?

Oh, my...

Both sides.

"Boston Strong."

Let... We gotta wave.

What does
that even mean?

Wave.

You're a national

fuckin' hero, kiddo.

You wave, Jeff.

They're all out for ya.

You're a real hero.

Isn't that somethin'?

And it's just the start.

That's really somethin'.

I'm a hero
for standin' there

and getting my legs blown off?

Yeah,
what are ya talkin' about?

That's the HOV for
electric vehicles and whatnot.

No, it... Like for, uh,
just for handicap cars.

No, no, there's no
handicap drivin' lanes.

Jesus, what a bunch of morons.

Okay, we're fuckin' morons,

'cause we care about
people with disabilities?

Oh, oh,
Jeff, Jeff! He's here.

Fuck you.

Here we go.

All right, let's do this.

Yes!

Come on.

Look out.

Hey.

I got this back there.

Oh, shit, don't pull it.

Okay, got it, buddy?

Got the back?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Patty, I still think
Jeffie could live with me.

Oh, yeah, all the way
up there in Cow-Hampshire.

All his friends are here,
ya idiot.

All due respect,
I got more room
than all of yas.

And I'm the only one
with a credit score above 520.

I'm the one got a pool.

Above fucking ground!

Oh, careful, careful.

Ow!

For God's sakes!

Jesus! My shin splints.

God. You're gonna have to get

a place with a ramp
or an elevator.

We're all gonna end up
in a fuckin' wheelchair.

Just tryin'
to take it real lightly.

He's home!
That's all that matters.

God, I got a lot to do and...

So psyched.

Oh, my God, I thought it was
gonna be better than this.

Yeah, look at this, huh?

Where's Jeffie?

Oh, Jeff. You okay?

Hey, there he is.

All right. This is it.

This is it. Welcome home!

Is it good to be back?

Oh, my God, it's a little
crazy at the moment,

because people, you know,
they send you these...

This stuff...
It's, uh, every day.

It's, like, packages.

From all over the world!

Packages all

Ya gonna have to look at some

Oh, can he drink yet?

'Course he can drink.
Didn't cut his balls off.

It's cute.

The whole world's
watchin' ya, kid.

Yeah, you're like
a symbol to
a lot of people.

For what?

Ya know,
you're Boston Strong, right?

Huh?

We're proud of you, Jeff.

I'll have
one of them beers, Patty.

E.

Can you help...

Can you give me
a hand for a second?

Yeah.

Uh, the, uh, bathroom.

Gotta go to the bathroom.

Yeah.

Pizza, Bob?

I'd love a piece,
Big Jeff, thank you.

All right.
You gonna come get it

I'd like you

Do you need the chair?

Yeah. I think.

Yeah.

Careful of your bandages.

I got it, I got it.

Okay.

Mmm-hmm.

Do you want me to close it?

Yup.

You can just

What?

You can just

Here.

You can go, Erin.

You sure?

Call me
if you need me, okay?

I don't need a doctor.

Oh,

What time is it?

You know what time it is,

and we have to be going.

Jeffrey?

Jeffrey, good morning.

Jeffrey, are you awake?

Gonna be late for rehab.

Come on.

No, I'm up. No, I'm up, Ma.

Oh. Okay. All right.
I think he's...

I got my coat.
I... I'm wearing my coat.

This is what I'm wearing.

What the hell was that?

Fuck.

Jeffrey?

Sweetie, Jeffrey,
are you okay?

I hear it.

Shh!

Jeffrey! Just tell me
you're okay, baby.

I don't know what he's doing.

What do you think is going on?

Jesus, Patty, what do you
think boys do in their room

when they lock their door?

Yeah, I think
he's doin' it.

You think he...

The kid's got no legs
and he's blowin' loads.

Dirty fucking...

Jeffrey?

It's gonna be
very special, Jeffie.

Everybody wants to see ya.

See how good you're doin'.

I just wish you would have

let somebody
cut your freakin' hair.

Oh,
stop pickin' on him.

It's gonna be good.

Hello.

Hello.

Hi. He's doin' good.

He has an appointment. So...

I'm his Aunt Jenn.
I'm here for support.

<i>After the bomb blast</i>

<i> at the Boston Marathon
took most of his legs,</i>

<i> 28-year-old
Chelmsford resident</i>

<i> Jeff Bauman
is lucky to be alive,</i>

<i> but his real struggle
has just begun.</i>

<i> Bauman told reporters that
he will one day walk again.</i>

<i> After multiple surgeries</i>

<i> and endless
painful rehabilitation,</i>

<i> many people would give up.</i>

Erin, come here!

<i> But with the support</i>

<i> of his family and friends...</i>

Jeff's on TV!

My Jeff?

Come here.

<i> ...supporters
all over the world.</i>

<i> Jeff Bauman
has found something amazing</i>

<i> here at Spaulding Hospital.</i>

<i> That something is called hope.</i>

<i> In the days following
the Marathon bombing,</i>

<i> this photograph
showed the carnage
at the finish line.</i>

<i> Jeff Bauman was standing
next to one of the bombs</i>

<i> when it detonated,
obliterating his legs.</i>

<i> A day later,
from his hospital bed,</i>

<i> Bauman scribbled a note.</i>

<i> "I know what happened."</i>

<i> He's a real hero, my son.</i>

<i> He's helpin' this city heal.</i>

<i> Be Boston Strong.</i>

<i>Is that true, Jeff?</i>

<i> Are you Boston Strong?</i>

<i>You did
real good today, kiddo.</i>

That kind of exposure,
you know...

That could lead
to opportunities.

Make things, you know,

easier for ya...

Yeah.

...down the line.

You got a call from Carlos.

He wants to visit with ya.

<i> And we should
be thankful for him.</i>

In here. Hey.

Sir, how you doin'?

Hi. How are you?

Paul Martino.

How are you, Paul?

Nice to meet you.

Uh, casts shouldn't
take more than...

Hour, hour and a half.

Okay.

Cast is a very
quick procedure,

but it's
the most important part.

If we get
a good impression of you,

then the rest of the procedure
is gonna go nicely.

You okay?

Yeah.

We're gonna start
on this side, okay?

We're gonna slip a sock
on you here.

It's just
a cotton stocking that...

This is so that when
we wrap the plaster on you,

it doesn't stick
directly to your skin.

D'you hear the one

where the farmer
was paintin' his bathroom?

Figured he'd shellac
the toilet seat,

make it look prettier.
He didn't tell his wife.

Daughter says,
"What's the matter, Dad?

Ain't you ever seen
one of these before?"

He says, "Yeah, I just never
saw anybody frame it."

Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, Jeff.

Don't make him
laugh too hard.

...allow this to get hard.

And then we're gonna
make a slice in it.

We're gonna take it
right off you, okay?

Maybe you could, uh,
use your new legs

for next week
at the Bruins game, huh?

Ma, that's, like,
in a week.

Give me
a couple of weeks

of fabrication and delivery.

Get outta here.

Couple of weeks, Jeff,
you'll be up.

I can't wait.

We can get you up
any time.

We're gonna clean up this side

and then we'll go on
and do the right.

We'll be just as quick and...

I wanna have it signed.

Less pain. Okay...

Yeah, yeah.

...but at least you know
what to expect.

Right.

They've asked him
to go out

on the ice and wave the flag.

<i>Jonny Gomes
coming to the plate here</i>

<i> for the Red Sox.</i>

Go, Jonny!

Get us a fuckin' hit.

<i>Be one to one now.</i>

Don't swing at that shit.
Let that shit go.

<i>Gomes
with a special bat in hand,</i>

<i> to remember the victims</i>

<i> of the Marathon...</i>

Hey, Jeff!

You hear that?
His bat says "Boston Strong."

Hey, leave him be.
He's snappin' a deuce.

No, no, no, no, no!

God damn it.

Not too good, huh?

No, he fouled up.

After everything
we've been through?

Haven't we suffered enough?

Hey, so is he gonna do it?

Oh, I dunno.
He's nervous.

He's nervous about what?

Jeff, we heard
about the Bruins game!

Sounds pretty cool, bro.

They're gonna
give us box seats.

Wait, us?

Said we could
bring the whole crew.

Yo, you gotta do this, Jeff!

Free drinks!

Bruins need ya!

Don't be a pussy, bro!

Shit. Ow!

What kinda food
they got?

All-you-can-eat.

It's all-you-can-eat,
Jeff. Come on, man...

Stop being selfish
about this shit.

Is that my phone?

Hello?

Smells delicious, Ma.

Thank you.

Dad, I'm gonna sit with you.

Sure.

<i>E-Money.
What're you doin'?</i>

Uh, talkin' to you.
What are you doin'?

Dancin'.

<i> Hey, let me just
step out of the club.</i>

What?

<i> Can you hear me now?</i>

Yeah, I can hear you.

How you doin'?

Yeah, you know.

Hey, so I hope...

I hope that I didn't
get ya at a bad time,

but I, uh, you know,
it's the, uh,

<i> Bruins playoff game
against Chicago next week</i>

and they asked me
to come out there on the ice.

On the ice?

Yeah, I'm not,
like, on the...
Not to play,

but, y'know,
to be the banner captain

and, like,
wave the flag and shit.

<i> It's kind of like
singin' the national anthem,</i>

<i> but for people
who suck at singing.</i>

You sure you wanna do that?

Well, everybody says I should.
It's the Stanley Cup, so...

<i> Listen, Erin, I... I know
we're not together, but...</i>

I was just, um...

I was wondering
if maybe you wanted

to come with me
and my family.

<i> I don't think that
I could do it without you.</i>

And I know that it's
not really fair of me to say.

I'm really...
I'm sorry, um...

But I...

I really need you right now.

<i> And, uh, please.</i>

Okay. Yeah.

<i>During tonight's warm-up,</i>

<i> we would like to invite you
to purchase</i>

<i> raffle tickets
for the Boston Bruins...</i>

Hey, they had
that Carlos "cowboy hat" guy

all over the news last night.

Jeff, he told the story
and I was fuckin' bawlin'.

You all right?

Yeah...

Gonna squeeze through
and get outta your way...

Mom's way here.

Oh, thank you.

Let's go, Boston!

All right!

Okay,
a toast, a toast!

You cool?

Yeah, I'm good.

Know why they
call Chicago the Windy City?

'Cause you guys blow!

Do you have a smoke?

Oh, oh.

Jeff, we'd like to, uh,
stage you sooner.

Oh, yeah.

If that's all right.

Yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Okay. All right.

Let's do this!

They're goin' now!

<i>And now...</i>

Ooh,
big crowd out there.

Completely full tonight.

Hey, don't be nervous.

How are you doin', Jeff?

Yeah, I'm great.

You okay?

Great. Just stop here.

I'm gonna get the flag.

Thanks.

Here's the flag, Jeff.

I'm gonna be standin'
right over there,

and then I'm gonna signal you
when to come out, okay?

All right? Have fun.

Have fun, okay? Get pumped.

Uh...

I don't think
I can do this, E.

Jeff, look,
it's gonna be okay.

You just wave the flag.
And then you leave. Right?

Okay, Jeff, that's
your cue. Get out there.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

<i> Welcome to TD Garden and
game two of the NHL playoffs.</i>

<i> Please give
a warm Boston welcome</i>

<i> to tonight's honorary
fan banner captain,</i>

<i> Jeff Bauman!</i>

<i> Jeff's continued strength
and perseverance</i>

<i> in the face of adversity
represents all that is...</i>

<i> Boston Strong!</i>

Go, Jeffrey!

Whoo!

I'm gonna get you
out of here.

Get away from me.
Get the fuck away from me.

Jeff...

Get away from me.

Get away from me!

You stay calm.

You stay calm,
you help somebody else.

Babe.

Hey. What...

Get away from me!

Jeff!

Get the fuck away from me.

Go help somebody else!

Go help somebody else!

You stay calm!

You stay calm!

You stay calm
and go help somebody else.

I'm sorry.

You need to tell your family
what's going on with you.

No, no.

Believe me, it's better
if they don't know. Trust me.

They keep trying to make
a hero out of me.

Does it hurt?

No.

I missed you.

I missed you, too.

I'm here, Jeff.
I'm here.

I'm here.

Did you have sex with my son?

Yeah.

Don't you think...

Shouldn't you
be leanin' on me?

Hmm?

I wish you were leanin' on me.

Just happy to be
sitting here with you.

<i>They are so futuristic,
aren't they, Jeffrey?</i>

What you have
is a Genium knee.

Genium is a microprocessing,

top-of-the-line,
high-tech knee.

Two carbon fiber sockets
with suction suspension.

Deep breath as you go up.

<i>And, like, you know,
you just gotta work, like,</i>

<i> you know, your core strength
and everything,</i>

<i> and then you gotta
stand up on 'em</i>

<i> and get your balance right.</i>

<i> But they're like...
They have...</i>

<i> They're like feet.
They are like feet and legs.</i>

And, like,
they're attached to shoes.

Mmm-hmm.

And you can just, like...

Were they cool?

I'm gonna walk.

You know, I'm gonna walk
with you again someday.

Read them at the same time.

Go.

See if they link up.

"Determination is...

"Don't be hasty.

"...the wake-up call

"Prosperity will knock...

"to the human will."

"...on your door soon."

I didn't hear yours.

No, I didn't
hear yours either.

Okay.

I'm gonna get it.

All right, keep going.

<i>I'm not gonna help you.</i>

You have to eat them
to be real?

That's, like, a super-loud...
You have a super-loud crunch.

Arms up. Get those arms up.

Do you wanna,
I don't know, like,

come live with me
or somethin'?

You serious?

<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

You have to tell Patty.

Yeah, I'll tell Patty today.

Okay.

She's so hungover, she won't
even remember, all right?

She won't remember.

We'll be living there
for two weeks.

We gotta fuckin' celebrate.

Boston Strong!

Look at ya!

Boston Strong!

Jesus Christ. Oh, God.

Can you believe this shit?

We needed a win, Bob.
We needed a win.

How we supposed to
not take this personally?

Hey, you got
a leaf in your drink.

It's a mint leaf.

A mint, huh?

It's a mojito.

You muddle
the lime and the mint.

You add sugar and ice

and you pour
over rum, soda water.

You "muddle" it?

Yes, you muddle
the lime and the mint

and then you add
the sugar and ice.

Hey, when we gonna
hear this big announcement?

Yes, just tell us already.

Oh,
when the game's over.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey, so, Dale,
I need two burgers ready.

Um, you take that down,
that would be helpful.

Chips, too, if you don't mind.

Holy shit, you can taste
the mint, bro. Try that.

I'm happy
to make you guys one.

Yeah,
that'd be great, yeah, sure.

That's so nice
for having everybody over.

Three?

Hey, anybody that knows me

knows I don't do
nothin' half-assed.

Except high school.

Go fuck yourself, Bob.

Hey, Erin,
how are things at work?

You still at
Brigham and Women's?

No, no, I, um...
I actually gave them
my notice.

Ya get fired?

No, no...

What's...
What's his guy's name?

We're just taking
some time, Jeff and I...

I'm gonna be there...

That's wonderful, honey.

...through the therapy
and everything.

Yeah.

I'm moving in, actually.

Huh.

So, just to be around,

you know.

Wait, what?

Jeff told you.

You knew that.

No.

Jeff, you didn't
tell your mom?

Huh?

Jeff?

You didn't tell your mom
I was moving in?

I... I thought
that's what today was for.

Like, you know, uh,
announcements and shit.

Very small apartment
for three people, Jeffrey.

Yeah, but technically
it's only like two and a half.

That ain't funny.

That ain't funny.

Oh, Patty, did you give
everyone the big news?

What? You told him
and you didn't tell us?

She didn't tell me shit.

I just knew there was
gonna be a big announcement.

Yeah, what's goin' on?

So, spill it already. Christ!

All right, all right,
all right, okay. This is it.

Come on, get me up.

Patty.

Get me up.

Okay, listen up,
this is how it's gonna be...

Fasten your seat belts.

Oprah's comin'.

Oh, my God!

Shut up!

Oprah called me!

She is flyin' down
to interview Jeffrey.

Day after tomorrow.

Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

You're gonna meet Stedman!

Hey, man.

No, no, no.

Oprah's fat ass...

Gayle! Oprah!

She's comin' to...

Patty. Patty.

What?

Jeff's not doing
that stuff anymore.

What do you mean? Fuck.

Fuck off.

Uh-huh.

He's not.

Come on, it's Oprah.

He's not doing interviews.
He's not doin'...

Jeffrey?

...public appearances.

None of that.

Jeffrey, talk to me.

It's too much.

Jeffie.

It's not good for him.

It's too much, because...

Yeah, 'course.

It's fuckin' Oprah Winfrey.

He doesn't want...

She's the most famous
person in the world.

Patty, all those
people looking at him,

asking him questions

and needing something.

Yeah, butt out.

Come on, Jeffrey, talk to me.

It's a lot of pressure.

And somebody's always tryin'
to take something from him.

It's too much, Patty.

You gonna let her do this

or you gonna tell me
for yourself?

I wanna hear from you.
You're not so drunk...

I'm speaking for him.

...ya can't speak to me.

If you would
listen to me...

No, you don't
speak for my son.

Why'd you... Why didn't
you tell me sooner?

What?

Why didn't you tell me sooner?

Why do you think? I wanted
to make it a surprise.

I wanted a big announcement.
You know?

It's Oprah Winfrey.

I'm sorry, Ma.

Where would I have
been without Oprah?

She got me through
the bad times.

And I don't know where,
what I would be.

I would've...
I would've hung myself

in the bathroom without Oprah.

Just sayin'.

Just sayin'.

So, hey,
if Oprah's your lifeline,

you got a lot
deeper issues, Patty.

I'm just sayin'.

Fuck you, Bob.

Shut up, Bob.

I just wanted people to see
how amazing my son is.

That's all.

What's so bad about that?

Aw, E, come on.

Sorry.

E, come on, push it.

I am.

There ya go.

I got it.

Hey.

Oh, hey.

Oh, how you doin'?

Um, really well. How are you?

Sully bought me
a fuckin' sombrero.

I'm...

He did?

Yeah.

This is from him?

Yeah, he said he was out

at a Mexican restaurant
last night, so...

They got super hammered
and brought back two sombreros

and I got one of 'em.

Lucky.

One...

Two, three!

Oh, fuck.

Fuck.

Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

I'm sorry.

<i>â™ª Let my love open the door</i>

<i> â™ª Let my love open the door</i>

<i> â™ª Let my love open the door</i>

<i> â™ª To your...</i>

<i> â™ª ...heart</i>

<i> â™ª To your heart â™ª</i>

<i>It's not over.</i>

<i>Oh, God.</i>

You listen
to this one, Jeffrey.

Listen to this.

This is from Denver, Colorado.

"You...
I have never seen a stronger,

"more brilliant person
in my life."

Go to sleep, Ma.

"Thank you so much."

She's talkin' about you,
Jeffrey.

Jeffrey?

She's talkin' about my son.

Hey, Jeffrey, we should go...
We should go to Colorado.

We should go to Denver.

Ma.

And go see those nice people.

I think we should
go to Denver, baby.

We should go to Denver
when you're better.

Just you and me, huh?

Go to fuckin' sleep, Ma!

Oh, all right.

Bye.

I don't wanna hear
any more of those letters.

Don't forget
about the Red Sox.

Want you to throw out
the first pitch.

Look, I gotta tap out, boys.

I have rehab in the morning.

I don't want
the lady gettin' pissed.

Want some pills?

You fuckin' retarded, Sully?

I just told you,
I gotta get home.

What are they?

Not sure.

Found 'em
on my sister's dresser.

You're either
gonna get high as fuck,

or they're gonna
regulate our periods.

Pretty sure.

Excuse me.
Are you Jeff Bauman?

We have been
following your story

ever since we saw that photo.

Then we saw you at the
Bruins game, wavin' the flag.

It's so good
to see you're healed

and that you didn't
let them win.

Can we take a picture?

Yeah, sure.

Okay.

Who didn't I let win?

The terrorists.

Can we... Yeah,
let's get a picture with him.

Oh, right, yeah.

Are you sure about that?

Yeah.

'Cause I mean, like...

Where I'm sittin'...

Y'know, looks like they at
least got on the scoreboard.

Y'know,
I'm never gonna walk again.

Ooh!

All right. One more,
one more, one more.

You don't get this picture,
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

Just one more.

Hey, Jeff!

God bless you.
Thank you, Jeff.

It was so nice to meet you.

Keep your stumps
together, though.

No. Come on,
give me some speed!

Oh, watch it, I'll get him.

Get him higher, Sull.

He's not gonna clear it.

Fuckin' clear over
your fuckin' head!

He won't fuckin'
clear me, Sull, get him up.

Come on, get me up, Sull!

Get him up, Sull!

Here we go.

Use your arms, Sull,
use your arms!

I think I'm gonna puke.

Shut up!

It's great!

Please...

Shut the fuck...

Gets...

Oh, shit!

Oh, shit!

Fuck you, Bauman.

I spilled my beer.

Watch me do a flip.

I give it a seven!

Seven?

I give it a seven!

Excuse me, excuse me!

That was a six.
That's a generous six.

At most.

He didn't stick
the fucking landing, bro.

Oh!

Ouch.

A tour of their facility.

But I'm gonna get a...
Should get a medal.

I'm your fuckin' hero.

Why, thank you.

You're welcome.

For finding the fucking
bombers, you piece of shit.

I should not be operating
machinery tonight.

Hey! Hey! Easy!

Shit, Sull. Ah!

Sull, didn't you get
your license yanked
for driving drunk?

Didn't you blow, like, a .08?

Better than who you blew
last week.

Hey! Hey.
Sull, no, you'll go to jail.

I'm just trying
to get you home

before your fuckin' wife
kills us.

No, she's not my wife!
Give me the keys.

Do you still even
got a license?

No, they don't lose...
You don't lose your license

when you fuckin'
lose your legs. Dumbass.

How you gonna
reach the pedals?

Fuckin' get down there.
You gonna push 'em for me.

Is that even safe?

No.

Okay.

There you go, buddy.

Get down there.

Hey! Watch... Watch the leg.

Sorry. Sorry.

Gas. Gas.

Gas.

Go back to sleep,

Where is he? Oh, shit.

Sull, I said the pedals,

What are you

D, I got my legs back, D!

Whoo-hoo!

Brake pedal?

That was

Let's go do donuts.
Jeff, let's do donuts.

Brake pedal.
Whoa, Sully, shit!

You gotta stop! Stop!

Come on!

Don't be a pussy!

Don't let

Brake pedal, gas pedal.

Sull, gas, gas.

Whoa. Brake, brake,

Let's go.
No, go over the hill!

Sull! Easy, easy,

Easy on the gas, bro.

Whoa, shit! Shit!

<i>Pull the car over.</i>

Anybody else in that car?

Let me see your hands,

Hey, wait a minute.

You Jeff Bauman?

Yeah, yeah.

What?

Yeah.

You are?

Yeah.

Can I get a picture with you?

<i>You, um,
put the sauce in too early,</i>

<i> it falls right to the bottom
of the cake.</i>

<i>Look at that. So soft.</i>

<i>And if you put it in too late,</i>

<i> it sits right at the top edge.</i>

<i>Oh, I love that.
That's a fun fact.</i>

You take your pill?

Did you take your medication?

No.

Jeff?

No.

Hello? What?

No.

No?

Could you take it, please?

Please, please, please.

Please? Pause it.

Pause?

No, keep going.

Hey, wasn't Patty supposed
to take you to rehab?

Pill packer.

Wanna go in front
of all those people

with the noise and the lights?

You'll be there.

You don't even have
to be there, Erin, you know?

Jeff is goin' out
on the field with
the Carlos guy.

It's why he's eatin' lunch
with him next week.

My God.

He's gonna
get to know him.

People think of them
as a team.

No, you think of us
as a team, Ma.

No, the whole fuckin' world
thinks of you as a team.

It's not just me.

It's just weird.

I don't wanna meet him,
I told you.

Oh, Jesus, Jeff.

Hey, guys.

God's sake, I made
the fuckin' reservation.

I don't wanna
meet Carlos.

I don't wanna relive
the worst day of my life.

We really have to be

on time for these
appointments. Okay?

We got stuck in traffic.

Yeah,
she forgot the sleeves.

She forgot the sleeves.

You okay?

Let's get about
a 30-second count there, okay?

Just add a little more
strengthening to it, okay?

So let's start off
with the right arm,

left leg for a count of...

One, two, three, four...

Remember, concentrate here
on the glutes.

Don't arch your back.

This is the first time
you're in this week

and you have
three appointments.

Okay?

You gotta get in here
as many times as you can

for your appointments...

I know.

I keep tellin' 'em, y'know?

...or it's not gonna work,
okay?

You have to keep
your appointments

and you have to come in
ready to work.

I mean, look at everybody
around here, Jeff.

They're recovering because
they put the time

and the energy into it.

And they make it a priority.
And you have to do that, too.

Did you find
everything?

Yeah.

Do you have a bathroom?

We do.
It's right over in the corner.

Jeff?

Jeff?

Jeff.

Jeff.

Wake up.

Wake up.

You and Patty get hammered?

Wake up.

Blanket?

Mmm-hmm.

You want the board?

Yeah.

Can I have my Gatorade?

I got it.

Yeah,
he'll be helpin' the Red Sox.

It's his favorite team
since he was a little boy.

Jeff's throwin' out
the first pitch

isn't gonna help 'em win,
Patty.

Bruins lost that game
that we went to.

Whoa!

Thought we said we weren't
gonna say that out loud.

You see,
the fact you say that, Erin,

shows how little
you know about baseball.

Are you...
Are you even from here?

Smart.

Okay.

Huh? What?

How they feel? Good?

Yeah.

All set?

All right, when you're ready,

you're gonna scooch ahead
before you stand up.

Okay, let me just
straighten that leg there.

Mmm-hmm.

Yup.

Okay.

Okay, scooch ahead.

Okay, got it.
I'm gonna get this.

Up. Hips back, hips back.
Chest up.

Chest up.

Jeffie. You're up!

Chest up, okay?
Chest up.

My God!

Chest up. Chest up.

Good, good. Okay? Good.

That's amazing. Wow.

You okay?

God, you are so tall.

All right? Okay.

It's a little sore there.

Oh, my God.

Okay.

Nah, it's like needles
in my legs.

Okay.

Yeah,

but you look awesome.

Good job, Jeff.

Oh, you're amazing,
Jeffie. Looks amazing.

It's the first time.

Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

I can't, I can't.

Good job.

Let him sit.

I gotta sit down.

Okay, yup. Okay.

Good job. Good job.

Wheels, before... It's
gonna make it easier for ya.

Ya lock the wheels first.

I just... I did.

E.

And then ya pull up

the seat.

Hey, E,

can you get my Gatorade?

I don't have it.

Ya didn't lock...

Fuckin'...

...the wheels, 'cause if you
did, it wouldn't be movin'.

No, you still haven't done it!

Would you back off?

Oh, Patty!

What?

Jesus Christ,
I'm sick of this shit.

I'm sick of both of you.

What?

E, what the fuck? Calm down.

I'm tired of you

fuckin' talkin' to me like
I'm an idiot.

A child
is what you are.

Okay?
I am not an idiot, Patty.

Every time you open your...

Ma, cut it out.

This is behavior
I've come to know and love.

Do you understand me?
Really, I can't...

I'm just callin' it
like it is.

I'm tired, Jeff, okay?

Everybody's tired!

This didn't
just happen to you.

What do you mean,
it didn't just happen to me?

It did just happen to me!

Could you just open your eyes
for one fucking second,

and acknowledge
the huge circle...

Look at me! Look at me!

Jeff, the huge circle
of people

that have fucking
altered their lives

to orbit around you. Okay?

You have no fucking idea
how much...

You act like this is
fucking easy for him!

When do I act
like this is easy?

Last night,
he's fucking wasted

and covered in his own shit.

Hey...

And I have to clean him up.

And nobody else is there
helping me.

Oh, it's my fault?

I have to carry him
to the bed.

Can you not fucking say that
right now?

What?

Can you not talk

about that right now?

People are watching!

I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit.

Well, maybe they don't teach
you manners in Amesbury, huh?

You say one more fucking thing
about Amesbury, Patty,

I'll punch you in the fucking
face, you understand?

Don't you threaten me.

Get in the car!

Go. Get in the car.

You gonna let her
talk to me this way?

You just fuckin' walk away.
You're not on the team.

So you gonna
tell me what's goin' on?

Uh, stress, lack of sleep,

uh, minor surgeries,
fittings for his legs.

Okay.

Physical therapy sessions.

His mom yelling at me

for every fuckin' thing
I have ever done.

I knew this was gonna happen.

This is what you do,
you just take on too much.

You take on
other people's problems

and you forget yourself.

Uh, what the fuck is this?

Did... Please tell me
you found this in a dumpster

and you're playing
some prank on me.

I'm just kidding.
Okay. Uh... Fuck.

Um, how long?

Five weeks.

Does he know?

No.

I'm tellin' him tonight.

Here we go.

Yeah, so I saw...

Saw him on the news
again yesterday.

That's good rotation
on that.

It's like a shish kebab.

Burn that shit.

Oh, yeah,
light that up.

Him and that...
That goddamn cowboy hat.

It's a whole event, that hat.

He really wear
that thing in real life?

You still talkin' about
that Mexican guy?

Costa Rican. Jesus, Bob,

welcome to 1965, buddy.

You know what I meant.

For God's sakes.

I tell ya what, I'd really
like to meet that guy.

Costa Rican, Mexican,
Honduran, whatever he is.

I don't care.

Why?

He's a fuckin' American hero,
Jeffie.

Not for him,
you wouldn't be sittin' here

drinkin' beers on my tab.

Fuck that guy.

Come to think of it,
maybe he ought to pay.

Hey, Jeffie,
wasn't I supposed to take you

to pick up your girl,
like, 10 minutes ago?

Hey, you want...
Who wants another round?

I'll have one. Who's paying?

Who you think?

Not you.

Uncle Bob.

Hey, can I just get

the check?

What's up?

Can I just get the check?

Oh, sure.

Yeah, four...
Four mai tais.

Give me an order
of fried rice

and some, uh, chicken wings.

Yeah, yeah.

I dunno.
I like pizza, too.

Don't forget my order.

Hey, you're the guy.
From the wheelchair.

One in the picture
with the guy

in the fuckin' cowboy hat?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Hey, that's awesome.

Hey, you know what?

Me and this
fuckin' handsome guy...

We work, like, 10 blocks away

from where
the bombin' happened.

Yeah.

It's fuckin' crazy, right?

Yeah, like, right there.

We were right there.

Right there.

We saw
the whole fuckin' thing.

Hey, you know what, though?

No shit.

Let me ask you.
That whole thing,

it was a conspiracy, right?

Mai tais?

The whole thing
was a hoax.

Yeah.

It was like
a fuckin' false flag.

It was like it didn't happen.
It was all, like, bullshit.

Fuckin' so Obama could
send us to war with Iran.

We're not gonna tell anybody.

What?

You...

You got paid
to do the bombing.

Fuckin' Obama
did this whole thing

so we'd go to a war
with Iran, bro.

What the fuck
are you talking about?

He's got a point.

Hey, you know what?

We're already at war
with Iran,

you fuckin' douchebag.

Oh, yeah?

Ooh.

Fuckin' douchebag?

The fuck you talkin' about?

Fuck you.

This guy's
fuckin' phony-baloney.

Easy, easy...

Phony-baloney.

Fuck you!

Hey, come on, man!
Say, take it easy.

You fuckin' make pizza,
you piece of shit.

Fuck you, man.

You're fuckin' nuts, buddy.

Come on!
Somebody fuckin' hit me!

Fuckin' hit me, huh?

Fuckin' hit me!

Fuckin' hit me!

Hey, stop, stop.

I got
your messages after,

when I was
tryin' to call you.

That's...
That's such bullshit, Jeff.

You drunk?

Not anymore.

Were you ever gonna
show up tonight?

Or were you just gonna
leave me sitting there?

What is this?

Open it.

What is it?

Open it.

Why?

Open the letter.

"Someone small
and wonderful

"is about to happen to you."

"Someone small and..."

Is this a fuckin' joke?

No, it's not a joke.
Why would I joke about this?

Is this like a...

Yeah.

Like what...

I can't do this.

Someone else
you don't show up for.

Erin, you... You...

Jeff, I gave up
my family for you.

And my job.
I'm not giving this up, too.

This is bigger than you.

I thought you were careful.

Careful?

I can't do this.
I can't do it.

I can't raise a kid.
I can't look after him.

I can't... I can't look...

What am I supposed to do?

I'm supposed
to chase after him?

Like, I'm supposed
to chase after him?

How am I gonna
take care of him?

I'm gonna...
I'm gonna mess him up.

Yes, you are gonna
mess him up.

But not because
you don't have legs.

Because you're
a fucking kid still.

You let your mom
push you around

like a baby in a stroller.

Oh, fuck you, Erin.

You do!

Fuck you, Erin!

You just have to show up
for once.

Show up?

Yes.

Show up?

Yes!

I fucking showed up for you!
I showed up!

I was standing there for you!

Oh, fuckin' what...

And look what it got me!

So this is my fault, then?

I showed up for you!

All of this
is my fault, right?

I showed up for you!

It doesn't scare me!
Just show up, that's it!

I can't! I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

Why do you even want me?

Why? I'm such a fuckup!

Can't do it. I'm not...
I can't do it. I can't.

Don't walk away from me. Erin!

Erin!

Erin!

Don't walk away from me.

Erin! Erin!

Erin!

Erin, don't walk away from...
Erin!

Hey!

Mind your own
fuckin' business!

Hey!

Erin!

Hey!

Open the door!

Erin!

Erin. Erin.

Erin. Erin!

Please!
Please! Please!

Go help somebody else.

Lay back, I got you.
I got you.

Help somebody else!

Stay calm.

Go help somebody else.
I'm good.

This one's critical.

We need help.

Hold on. Just relax.

You're going to be okay.
Help is coming.

Over here!
We need a chair over here.

Erin...

Please, open the door.

Carlos.

Jeff.

Oh, you want one of these?

Uh... Coffee, please.

Want to have a beer,
anything like that?

No. Thank you.

It's too early for me.

Not for me.

Well, thanks for showing up.

It's the least I could do.

So...

Yeah.

Why were you there?

At the finish line?

Yeah, I mean, y'know, like,
based on that hat

and my limited knowledge
of aerodynamics,

I assume it wasn't to run.

No, no, I...
I wasn't there
to run, I...

I was there for my boys.

They were running in the...

No, no, my...

My boys are dead.

Shit.

They died years ago.

Uh...

Oh. Thank you.

Do you have kids?

Mmm. Uh...

Mmm.

Alex, uh, was my oldest.

Uh, he was a Marine,

but he got killed
by a sniper in Najaf.

You know,
the way I find out is,

a van pulls up in front
of my house and...

And three Marines,
they get out.

But I knew.

I knew before they rang
the doorbell, I knew.

And then I did something
very stupid, right?

I grabbed a can
of gasoline
and a blowtorch

and I ran past them and...

And I locked myself
in their van.

They tried to
pull me out. The...

The blowtorch sparked
and I, um...

Those Marines,

they could have died,
and they saved me.

The worst part is, I...

I had to go to my son's
funeral on a stretcher.

I'm not proud of that,
you know.

What about
your other son?

Brian.

You remind me of Brian.

He took his own life.

It was too much for him.

You know, losing his brother,
and seeing me like that.

Shit, Carlos.

I can't tell you how much

I wish I had been there
for them when they needed me.

Hmm. But now I...

I travel the country,
talking to soldiers.

Mostly about PTSD
and depression.

I help a little.

And it keeps me going.

But the truth is...

I don't understand.

Mmm.

I was there that day
at the finish line

handing out American flags
for my boys.

When the first bomb
went off,

I looked up and I saw
a big ball of fire

and my body wanted to run.

But I thought,
this is a moment, huh?

Make a better choice.

So I ran to the fire
and there you were.

Helping you

made me feel

like I had helped my son.

And for that,
I am grateful.

You're grateful?

Yeah.

You help me
as much as I help you.

And I came here to say,
"Thank you."

Hmm.

Straight to voicemail, huh?

I don't blame ya.

<i> Listen,
I've been thinking, um...</i>

<i> You know, our...
Our kid, he or she</i>

is, uh... Gonna have legs.

<i> You're gonna be, like,
a really good mom.</i>

<i> 'Cause you been dealin' with
a big, dumb kid already.</i>

<i> Sittin' here, uh,</i>

<i> bein' without you, it's like
the worst fuckin' thing</i>

<i> that's ever happened to me.</i>

By a long shot.

<i> There was this, like,
there was this time</i>

<i> in the hospital when,
like, I...</i>

<i> I just wanna give up.</i>

<i> Y'know, like, where I...</i>

<i> Just, like,
didn't care if I...</i>

Come on. Come on.

<i>...died or not. And...</i>

<i> Now I just wanna...</i>

Come on, man.
Come on, man.

Come on, man.

<i>I just wanna walk.</i>

<i> Y'know, I just wanna stand up.</i>

I wanna see the world
from higher up, y'know?

I just...
I just wanna be normal.

Conference
on the mound.

You wanna just go
out there and just make

a fool outta yourself
in front of everybody?

You can't do it like this.

What, I got the catcher
walkin' out to the...

Let's go, Coach.

What?

I'm gonna put him in.

What are you talkin' about?
I threw one ball, guys.

It's your whole
shoulder, your whole body...

Aim for his balls,
he's wearin' a cup.

See, that's a little better.

How 'bout you throw
that over the plate?

Here we go.

Oh, Jesus Christ!
That's terrible.

Thirty-seven thousand fans
are gonna be booin' your ass.

You're all messed up,
all right?

So listen to me.

Just listen. All right?

You're a bunch
of fuckin' disasters.

Jesus.

You got that right.

But I wouldn't trade ya in
for anything.

So just do me a favor,
all right?

Help me out?

All right?

Let's go. Okay.

Come on, buddy,
muscle memory.

You know how to do this.

<i>And now it's just about
healing, getting better</i>

<i> and showin' the world
I'm fine and that, y'know,</i>

<i> I'm not gonna let this
hold me down, y'know,</i>

<i> 'cause then
maybe if they see that,</i>

<i> then maybe they won't let
stuff hold them down, either.</i>

<i> And y'know there's always
gonna be pain, I think,</i>

<i> y'know, but, I dunno, I just</i>

<i> wanna, like...</i>

<i>...live.</i>

<i>...the Marathon tragedy,</i>

<i> was a man in a cowboy hat,</i>

<i> rescuing a severely
injured man.</i>

<i> The man in the cowboy hat
had lost one son...</i>

How you feelin', Carlos?

A little nervous.

Yeah.

My hands are shakin'.

My boys would have loved this.

Hey, Carlos.

Yeah?

I'm gonna be a father.

That's wonderful.

It's time, Jeff.

Ready?

Yeah.

A hero and his hero,
right?

Hi. How are you?

Hello.

Good.

I'm Jackie.

How are you, Jackie? Jeff.

How are you?

Jeff, nice to meet you.

So nice to have you here.

Hi.

Hi, there, how are you?

Nice to meet you, Carlos.

All right,
so we're gonna walk you out

right in front
of the mound and...

...sound good?

All right.

All right, let's go.

Been practicing?

Yeah.

Go Bauman!

Your boy's on the TV.

There he is,
there he is.

Oh, wow.

Here comes the ball now.

That's a special ball.

Yes, it is.

Hi, I'm Pedro Martinez.

I think I know
who you are.

Oh, great.

How you doing?

I'm good.

You're very brave,
you know?

We're all proud of you.

Thank you.

Here.

You gotta show me
how to do a circle changeup.

Well...

Go Bauman!

Yeah! Whoo!

All right, you got any tips?

Well, aim high.

You're gonna be
all right, kid.

All right.

How did you get so good?

Let's go!

He was good
under pressure.

You've gotta
give it to him.

All right?
You've gotta give it to him.

He is under pressure.

There's a lot...

A lot of people watching that.

<i>Carlos and Jeff
have gigantic smiles</i>

<i> from ear to ear
on their faces.</i>

<i> What a... What a great moment.</i>

<i>See those guys coming out,</i>

<i> you know, everybody
cheering and clapping.</i>

<i> Actually, you know,
I got goose bumps.</i>

<i> I got chills. So emotional.</i>

<i> The fans were on their feet.</i>

<i> Wonderful tribute
by the Red Sox.</i>

It was a nice pitch.

It was not on the corner.

Thanks...

Either way,

I'll still buy you a beer.

No, it wasn't. It was on...

I'll still get you a beer.

Hey.

So I try and do
a circle changeup.

How you doin', man?

Did Pedro show it to you?

Good job, Jeff.

Hey, maybe
we should turn around.

You're Boston Strong.

Thank you.

All right,
watch the shoulder,
that's his throwin' arm.

Careful.

I know. Careful, I gotta

protect my throwin' arm.

Got a career ahead.

Hey, don't pat
the throwin' arm, man.

Hey! Hey!

Jeff!

Sounds like you, Sull.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Whoa, stop.

Can I talk to you
for a second, man?

What's goin' on here?

Kind of in a rush.

Just gimme a second here.
I just wanna talk to him

for a second.

What can I help you with?

Uh...

My, um...

My kid brother, he, uh,

was in the Marines, uh...

You know, over in the war.

And 'bout five years ago,
he got hit with an IED.

He's gone, man.

But, uh...

Sorry about that, man.

Yeah.

You know what, I saw
your picture that morning.

You know, after the bomb?

All I could think about
was Thomas.

Just lyin' there in the dirt.

I... I get so fuckin' angry,
y'know?

Y'know, but seein' you
out there today,

throwin' that fuckin' pitch,

you showed the world that
they can't fuckin' break us

no matter what
the hell they do.

Y'know, it...
It gave me a little hope,

made me feel a little better,
and I just wanna say

fuckin' thank you for that,
man, that's all.

What's your name?

Uh, my name's Larry, uh...

Can I shake your hand, Larry?

You wanna shake my hand?

Yeah.

It's gonna be all right.

Yeah?

I'm gonna be okay, right?

So you're gonna be okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

All right.

Hey, go Sox.

Thank you. Go Sox.

Go Sox.

Go Sox.

Let's go, Sox!

Let's go get that beer.

Mr. Bauman?

Hi. Um...

My daughter here actually
wrote a report on you

for her third grade class.

Oh, yeah?

What's your name?

Sophie. Do your legs hurt?

Uh, sometimes. Yeah.

What'd you get on your report?

I got an A-minus.

<i>Just wanna
share this with you...</i>

<i>2009,
I ran the Boston Marathon...</i>

<i>The 89th floor
of the South Tower, but...</i>

<i>...and I remember
going through that...</i>

<i>...confirmed there were
77 people on that floor,</i>

<i> 67 died.</i>

<i>The only reason
they got out was because...</i>

All right.

Y'know,
I did the best I could

with what I had.

You did all right, Ma.

And I... I just wish
I'd done better for ya.

You did all right, Ma.

You're gonna be
a wonderful father.

All right.

You're all right there,
Jeffie.

We're good.

I'm good.

I love you.

Good.
