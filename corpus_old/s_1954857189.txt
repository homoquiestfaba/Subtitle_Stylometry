I used to be somebody.

Well, let me put it this way,

I used to be a tabloid
television producer,

the dirtiest, most unethical
bastard in the business.

That means I was
one of the best.

I was somebody.

But times change.

I got older,

new kids moved in.

Suddenly, an old hack
like me was unhireable.

And that's how this all started.

Stranded in that hellhole
called Los Angeles,

out of work,

out of options.

And knowing if I
was going to work,

I'd have to write my own ticket.

So, I decided to create
my own television series.

A travel show for stoners.

I'd find marijuana makers
all over the world,

smoke dope and
drink beer all day,

and get paid for it.

Huh, fucking genius
if you ask me.

All I needed was a cameraman.

And that's when my old
buddy Roland came in.

What's the hook?

He could use a gig, too.

Only problem?

He doesn't drink, smoke,

or do any drugs at all.

I can tolerate that.

Paying him was out
of the question.

So, I plied his
imagination with images

of exotic locations,
gorgeous beaches,

beautiful women.

Take Two.

Exotic locations, nude
beaches, naked women,

all on his air miles.

It wasn't long before Roland
was dusting off his gas mask.

It was simple as that.

A brainchild born of pot,
booze, and desperation.

And you know what?

It may have been better
if it was never conceived.

Because then, all this
never would have happened.

I'm Dave High, and
this is my story.

* Pack up your troubles

* Come on along

* When I start dreaming

* And life's a song

* In Honolulu across the sea

* Making wiki waki
down in Waikiki

* Those hula dancers
are sure good news

* Those joy dispensers
are cure for the blues

* It's absolutely
the place to be

* Making wiki waki
down in Waikiki

* No evening calls

* Anything goes

* Believe it or not

* And when the
night shadows fall

* That's when they're
all getting hot

* On the ukulele

* They use the movies
to light the night

* And every tune seems
to sound just right

* It's absolutely
the place to be

* Making wiki waki
down in Waikiki *

We were
somewhere over the Pacific

on the edge of 40,000 feet

when reality began to take hold.

The pre-flight joint
was wearing off

and I had a mother
of a hangover.

Roland's words
echoed in my brain.

What's the hook?

And that's when it dawned on me.

That's a pretty good question.

Who needs a hook?

Oh, shit.

I'm having a panic attack.

I try fighting it off
with a couple a beers.

Fuck a joint, I'd kill
for a fucking cigarette.

It is what?

Buffalo pork sandwich.

It's our upgraded meal.

It's $14.00.

Ah.

We're flying to Hawaii
to shoot a TV series,

and I don't have a fucking
clue what I'm doing.

I don't even have
anything set up.

This is what happens
when you believe

your own bullshit.

All right, settle down.

Take two.

We're flying to Hawaii,

to some remote place
on the Big Island

that's suppose to have the best

and cheapest pot on Earth,

and a nude beach.

Ah, that's better.

Oh yeah, Rosanne Barr
happens to live there, too.

I told Roland I know her.

I'd interviewed her once,

and I'm pretty
sure that I can get

the old pothead to fire
one up with me on camera.

I lied.

Panic, panic, this
is an emergency.

I immediately administer
20 milligrams of Valium

and another beer
to induce a coma.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

we will be landing shortly.

Five hours later, I awaken
in a place called heaven.

How come nobody told me it rains

every fucking day of the year

on this side of the island?

Pissing down rain all the
way from Hilo to Pahoa.

Pahoa, the pot
capital of Hawaii.

The Promise Land.

We traveled 2500
freaking miles for this?

Hmm, looks more like

an old Wild West town
than an island village.

And I don't know
whether to pull out

a one hitter or a six shooter.

It's sundown by the time
we arrive at our lodgings.

I wangled an invite from
the mother of an old friend.

Guess I forgot how old.

Oh, Jesus, we've checked
into the fucking Bates Motel.

Oh man, I've got to think fast.

I offer to pay for a
hotel room, for me.

Roland can have this
place to himself.

Him and Mrs. Bates,
five cats, two dogs,

a nest of cockroaches, and
a plague of coqui frogs.

Meanwhile, David has

a luxury suite in
downtown Pahoa.

Dolphins, nice
big king bed, I like this.

This is a new favorite.

Here it is.

Now, the next order of business,

stock the fridge and
procure some pot.

I don't walk 100 yards
before I score a cheap eighth

off a street dealer who
calls himself Surfer Dave.

And I hit the first bar I
find to have a few beers,

and wait and see if
this shit's any good.

We've either ended
up in Alabama,

or that asshole, Surfer
Dave, spiked the pot.

I set out to find the bastard,

to get some more.

Who's there?

Five-0.

That's not fucking funny, man.

Fucking $300.00 eighth.

What happened?

Oh man, I don't
know, I got ripped off.

How? What?

I was just a fucking idiot.

I hate to admit it, I
don't even want this in it.

Oh, it's got to be in it.

Yeah, yeah, I supposed
to know what I'm doing.

Dave High got ripped off? No.

Until I come to fucking
cow town Hawaii and I get,

I'm ripped off by a skel,
and it's a bit embarrassing.

I'm from LA, I
should know better.

Look, my hands are fucking
shaking, look, I'm still, ugh.

I could have been killed
for Christ's sake.

My body could be chopped up
and lying out in that jungle.

I need to smoke a joint
to tell you this, man.

I got to calm down, I'm
a bit shaken by this.

I feel like a fucking moron.

I'm feeling better already.

Oh yeah, I'm back to normal.

And finally I tell him how
Surfer Dave took me for a ride.

So, sure enough, I walk out
and there he is, Surfer Dave,

and I said, "That's
really good shit, man,

"you know, I'd like
another ounce of it."

But the catch is he
doesn't have it with him.

We're going to have to go out to

where he's got the pot,
some fucking house,

and it's supposed to
be about five miles.

Driving, driving, driving.

So, we most have gone
about 20 freaking miles.

I've no idea where it is.

And he says, "Well,
pull over here"

in pitch black, pitch dark.

And he says, "Okay, give me
the money, I'll be right back."

I had to step back.

Roland doesn't have the
best of nights, either,

at the Bates Motel.

You should have been here

about a month ago.

The whole house
smelled so beautiful.

That must have been awesome.

Oh, yeah.

Test for sound in driving rain

at 2:00 in the morning.

Between the frogs, the
cats, the odd screams,

and this heavy downpour, I
just can't get any sleep.

And Mr. T, the
tomcat, pissed on his tripod.

Mr. T--

This one,
yeah, you got to watch him.

We both need to get
out of Dutch for the day.

I want to score some more pot,

and find that nude beach.

But Roland's all fired up
about finding Roseanne.

So, we leave a few calling cards
around town and head north,

in search of sunshine,

and Hawaii's most famous
grower of macadamia nuts.

And God knows what else.

The Queen Liliulakalani
Kamuela Museum,

Roseanne bought the place
around the same time

she bought the macadamia
nut farm down the road.

Strange, we're the only
ones waiting to get in.

What kind of fucking
museum is this?

Hmm, gate's not locked.

Hello!

A woman in a white
bathrobe answers the door.

So, is the museum open?

The gate was not locked.

Holy fuck, it's her!

Are you Roseanne?

I didn't expect to see you here.

Oh, I'm sure.

She doesn't quite know
what the fuck's going on.

She's disturbed I got in,

and she thinks some
stalker's broken in.

Oh, I'm sorry.

No, it wasn't, didn't have a
lock, I just went straight in.

Now she's pissed.

So, we couldn't come back
at another point and see it?

No, okay, thanks!

So, it was getting to the point

where I knew that
I better just say,

"Sorry for bothering
you," and leave nicely,

or, you know, the shit
was going to hit the fan.

Oh, I'm so sorry to bother
you, okay, thank you.

That door just
slammed in my face.

I got to get the fuck out of
here before the cops arrive.

Whatever just happened,
what a fuck up.

If I thought quick,

I would have done the
whole thing differently.

But I don't think
that quick anymore.

Everyone says she's
living at the nut farm.

I guess you've got to wonder
why she's living in a museum.

If that wasn't enough, now
I have to deal with Roland.

I thought you knew her.

Well, you know, a long time ago.

Why didn't you remind her?

I figure if she
doesn't recognize me,

then how the fuck is she
going to remember me.

She's getting on, she's
probably got Alzheimer's.

Roland's like dripping
fucking water.

You got to call the publicist?

Yeah, of course I am, man.

All the way back to Pahoa.

The next day, Roland wakes
me up with more bad news.

Bet you drink that,

you know, instead of coffee.

He's had another
rough night at the Bates.

You know, I'm sick of you guys.

I've had 23
hours straight, no sleep.

And once again, damn cat
squirted on my tripod.

But the real bad
news is today's top story.

It's all over the local news.

The DEA's been
conducting drug stings

all over the Big Island.

And wouldn't you know it?

The operation began the
day we arrived in town.

What does that mean? Aloha!

Well, that just might explain

the welcome at the local pub.

Against the DEA?

Yeah, I know you, right?

I met you last night.

Everybody thinks we're narcs.

Look!

What was that, FBI taking
pictures of somebody?

How you doing? Aloha!

Aloha.

Where you from?

None of your business.

Huh, can't really blame him.

We're driving around
shooting cameras

out of a white Chevy that
screams undercover cop.

I'm never going to score pot
in this fucking town again.

And that's not the worst of it.

Now we got the
fucking chainsaw going.

Just shoot him
outside the window.

No, the worst of it is
three days on the Big Island

and we're under surveillance.

Those DEA fuckers
are watching me,

and I suspect a
connection to Surfer Dave.

Dave's got his watchdogs out,

telling him when it's
safe to come back to town,

cuz he thought I'd be gone
and he'd be able to come back.

He didn't count on us staying.

So now, you know, he's
holed up out in the jungle.

You keep
looking outside the window.

What's going on?

You know, man,
I feel like I'm in

a fucking Witness Protection
Program or something.

I'm looking out here and seeing
dudes spying on me out here.

I barely got enough weed
left to role a joint.

So, we're just going to have
to get out of Pahoa again

to find more pot
and that nude beach.

About 15 minutes
and 10 miles later,

we're in another
world of mighty waves

and towering palm trees,

scouring the virgin coastline

for people with
pot and no clothes.

Then, bingo, we hit the
daily double, the nude beach,

and about a dozen
dealers selling all kinds

of good stuff out of their cars.

Who's this guy parked
in a black pickup truck?

And he's wife's
sitting there with him

and they've got their kid,

but they shoo her
out of the car.

What really caught my
fancy was the hashish.

But I'd become a
discerning shopper.

Since Surfer Dave, I've
grown a bit more cautious.

So, I betted low
first to make sure

I wasn't buying
hardened dog shit.

I buy a piece and
offer the first puff

to some guy I get chatting with.

I used him as my
human guinea pig

and tried the hash on him.

I wait a few minutes
to see if it kills him

before I smoke it, man.

It actually turned out
to be quite good hash.

That was good, I enjoy it.

It's nice,
it's gentle, isn't it?

Hmm, seems safe.

Oh now, you can pakalolo.

This saves the marijuana.

His name's Tony,
he's a native Hawaiian healer.

I do the ancient
Hawaiian lomilomi.

Interesting.

And it's a type of
massage that is done.

Fascinating.

But it goes a little bit further

than just your regular massage.

I got a feeling he wants to do

that lomilomi on my dicky wicky.

But not now.

First give me the rub
on that nude beach.

Everyone here
knows that, you know,

you can go down
there and get naked.

Everyone here knows that you can

go down there and not get naked,

and nobody will
say or do anything.

Hey, hey, hey!

No one thinks anything sexual.

Everybody looks out of his heart

and beauty at
something beautiful.

You know, like a woman's
body dancing is beautiful,

and a man's body
dancing totally naked.

It's a beautiful thing.

I think Tony's
trying to get me nude.

I like the hair thing
and the hippie,

and the beard and the
whole thing going on.

You got the whole thing going!

Oh yeah, this
bastard's hitting on me.

Oh, just marry me, already,

just get over your stuff.

Well, same sex
marriage is legal in this state,

and I can't afford
to piss him off.

A girl doesn't
like to be rushed.

Give me time to think about
that marriage proposal.

I'll play blushing bride

as long as he escorts
us to the nude beach,

and gets the okay for us
to shoot the naked people.

I don't know, he could make
me a very good husband!

It looks like it's way back.

It was like I was
in a time warp.

That wedding's on hold.

Looks like we stumbled
upon the lost tribe.

You want to take pictures?

They don't mind if
you take pictures,

but try not to get anybody

that doesn't have any clothes on

out of respect, out of respect.

Unless they say it's all right?

Right, right, right.

Cuz I'd like to
put that element in,

but I'm going to
say give permission.

Yeah.

We're not going
to need permission,

and I don't want it.

That wasn't that
many nude people.

I probably saw more nude
men's asses than I did tits.

Most of these hippies
are as old as I am,

and they're not even
as pretty as me.

How am I going to sell this
fucking shit to pay cable?

Aloha.

Aloha!

I offer her 50 bucks
to take her clothes off,

which she declines.

I decide to change my approach

and lower the bar a little.

What the hell, she's got
a nice rack and no taste.

I have a friend

and he looks exactly like you.

A friend who looks like who?

You!

There's another me?

And she's got a
friend for Roland.

I say it's wonderful, mahalo.

Jaime.

Hi Jaime.

Isn't she beautiful.

Aloha.

You're welcome.

I prime America's next top
nude model with pot and beer,

but I still can't get her
to take her clothes off.

She'll never work on
this island again.

It's like someone spiked
my life with acid.

This seems to be going around.

So, look at this, the
way that package is.

What's going around?

Uh, the shits.

Ripped off by Surfer Dave,
Roseanne a fucking disaster,

somebody watching
our every move,

the nude beach a bust,

and now my guts are under attack

by some tropical parasite.

I'm in a race against time,

with a bottle of Kaopecktate.

Can you get this fucking
thing off, this is ridiculous.

It's designed that
way, it's for your protection.

Yeah great, well, I'm
trying to get this into me,

and I can't get the
fucking top off it.

What are you
going to get into you?

I get this into me.

Okay, where's the fucking top?

A measure--

Proper dosage.

I've got it, and
I've just been so sick.

That looks like shit!

I'm so sick.

That's disgusting.

No.

You're going
to do it in one shot.

Here's looking at you, kid.

What did that taste like?

Like sort of chocolatey flavor.

It's the only way I can survive.

I'm so sick, I'm a dying man.

That tells the story!

Kaopecktate
and plenty of liquids.

Oh, shit.

Is that just one day?

Roland's getting
impatient with me,

and he's fed up with
the Bates Motel.

It's now Sunday morning,
approximately 3:00 a.m.,

and here's the driving
rain once again.

Almost like clockwork, you
just can't get any sleep.

Same time every night.

Mrs. Bates gets up
to feed the pets.

So, for entertainment,

we watch the cats chase
and kill cockroaches.

Roland gets the leftovers.

Oh yeah,
they kill those roaches.

I think there's one
half dead in my bedroom.

Or else.

Don't argue with your mom.

Don't give her talk back.

And then, you know,
I get so upset.

Roland's become Norman Bates,

handyman, wheelchair
pusher, chauffeur,

and some other jobs
we won't talk about.

And I thought
maybe we cut some of the,

oh, what do you call
it, the one plant,

and put it in the pot.

You like action, don't you?

Oh, I like lots of action.

Yeah, I love you, baby,

you're so cute!
- Oh, wow.

I know if I don't get Roland

out of the Bates pretty fast,

he's going to pack
up and go back to LA.

To appease him, I sent an
email to Roseanne's publicist.

And I head up with my fiance,

I mean Tony, to meet Kimo,

a guy who rents out a
guesthouse on the ocean,

a place maybe Roland
and I can share.

And is this going
to be available?

Yeah.

I'm energetic and I
want to go three miles,

I can take my binoculars
down to the nude beach.

It sure is a good location,

only 100 yards from
Uncle Robert's,

a kind of hippie
community center

with an outdoor
market, general store,

and a tiki bar frequented by

some of the best pot
farmers on the island.

It runs west and there's
no assholes around.

It's fabulous.

Even better, they start
serving rum here at 9:00 a.m.

And at closing time

it's just crawling
distance to the guesthouse.

Only one little drawback.

It's at the base of a volcano.

Not long ago the
volcano erupted,

spewing rivers of red hot lava

that swallowed houses.
Villages, beaches,

and God knows how
many marijuana plants.

And that lava came
up within 20 feet

of devouring our future home.

Right here was the beach.

Was that lava flow?

That was the lava flow, 1990.

Did you stand
here and watch this?

Yup.

Only watched molten lava.

We watched the
lava just coming in.

For how long?

For two weeks.

Jesus!

As I'm talking to Kimo,

that fucking parasite
starts biting at my asshole.

But it turns out Kimo
has a nice native remedy.

I mean, what is that?

That's a noni.

So, what does it do?

What the noni does,

it cleans and takes
all the rubbish

from lining of your stomach.

Can I drink beer?

You can drink beer, you
can drink anything you want.

Really?

Hmm, now this sounds
like good medicine.

What do you think about
reefer, is that wikoni?

Noni.

Oh, sorry about that, man.

To me, reefer is good,
and the noni is good.

They kind of go together.

Seems like he
might be a cool landlord.

Smoke the reefer
and pick the noni.

If I rent this joint,

you going to get me
whacked on noni juice?

Oh, yeah!

Then, a little reefer?

Yeah, reefer and noni juice?

Oh, yeah!

The noni's extra though, right?

The noni's extra.

If we're going to settle in,

we may as well go native.

You like that?

Yeah.

Hmm?
It's you.

You know, they got change rooms.

Where's the fucking sleeve?

Fuckers, mother fucker.

It's you, man, that is cool.

What do you think?

Buy it, it's you.

What do you call this shit here?

Pakalolo.

Pakalolo.

I can never get that name right.

Pakalolo?

Is it pakalolo?

Yeah.

Pakalolo.

Pakalolo, by George,
I think I've got it!

And if you want more than one?

I guess it's Pakaloli,
right, is that plural?

If pakalolo would be pakaloli?

I don't know, I don't think so.

I don't speak Hawaiian.

* Good tea is my weakness

* I know it's bad

* It sends me gate and I
can't wait I'm viper mad *

Now speaking of pakalolo,

I've heard it grows
wild all around here,

and I've been combing
the tropical jungles

looking for more.

I got to keep reminding myself,

I'm supposed to be filming
a television series here.

Especially on this
side of the island

because of the volcanic soil.

Wouldn't it be funny
if we actually found it?

If we actually found
a pot plant here

it's sure to make
me back that money,

you know, Surfer Dave
ripped off from me.

What are my chances of
walking through there

and finding a nice pot plant?

Zero to nothing.

Seems the locals have
a monopololo on the pakalolo,

and they're not about
to give up the farm.

They're a great crash crop,

It's a very big cash crop here.

Majority of all the people

who do grow marijuana,
or pakalolo,

it's their livelihood,
that's how they make money,

that's how they feed their kids

and support their family.

Pot's the backbone
of the local economy,

and although it's
not exactly legal,

the cops look the other way.

I got to rank this

as the most 420 friendly
place for a user,

not a distributor, but
for a smoker of pot,

that I've seen in a
country, maybe in the world.

It's a mellow place.

You're not bothering anyone,

no one's going to bother you.

I meet this guy over a joint

and a Mai Tai at Uncle Robert's.

At first, I'm sure
he thinks I'm a narc.

I suspect he might be one, too.

This is my job.

You're freaking cool.

This is my job, okay?

Cool.

Cuz cops don't hug.

He wants to keep
his identity a secret.

The reason will become
clear soon enough.

So, for now, let's just
call him Deep Shit.

And let's just say he's got
vast personal experience

with the local pot industry

and the Big Island drugs laws.

What happens if I get
busted with an ounce?

You know, if
you get busted with an ounce,

more than likely the
judge is going to say,

"Do you have $100.00
to pay this fine?

"Pay your fine, and get
out of my courtroom.

"Next case."

Hawaii's a medicinal state.

Marijuana's only legal
for medicinal use.

But even without a card,

you're not likely to get
hassled by the local cops.

What's the
big deal smoking a joint?

No one's going to really
pull you into jail

for smoking a joint.

Nobody is going to bother you

for being in your place
or communing with nature,

and smoking a little pot.

The feds though,
that's a different story.

They don't want you

until you're starting
to mess with money.

Between the lines

there's a drug war
being waged here.

Ask Roger Christie.

He's one of the most prominent
cannabis activists in Hawaii.

And he brought the
battle to the Big Island

when he started
the THC Ministry,

a church that regarded
marijuana as a sacred herb,

and served it up
during services.

In 2010, the DEA busted him

on marijuana possession
and trafficking charges.

And as I stand here,

the poor bastard's
still locked up

in a nasty little
Guantanamo in Honolulu,

awaiting a trial that
never seems to come.

It's like Stalin's Russia

to be held without bail,
without official charges.

Maybe this place
isn't heaven after all.

Roland wants me to get an
interview with the local cops,

thinks it will give our
travel show more credibility.

Hawaii Police Department, can
you get that through there?

Here you go, better
put this in here.

Why, what's the deal?

Well, there's a
little bit of pot in there,

my daily supply.

Wait a minute,

you had that at a
police department?

We'll say no.

Fuck credibility,
cops are a buzzkill.

But I go through the motions.

Thank you very
much for your help.

I tell Roland the sarg has
to run it by the chief.

I lied.

I only asked the desk clerk
for directions to the volcano.

Hello?

And I texted Tony to
call me in 15 minutes.

Oh, hi Sarg, how are you?

Oh, cool.

Uh huh.

Oh, okay.

Oh okay, so really.

No, that's fine, but thank you,

I appreciate you taking the time

and I'm sorry to trouble you

but thank you very much.

Okay, I appreciate
it, take care now.

Oh fuck!

What was that?

That was the sarg.

And?

No ride along,

can't do an interview
with an officer,

and if we want any
crime statistics,

we can basically get
them off public records.

You know, or they
can get them to us.

So, in other words, they're
not going on camera.

I wonder why.

Don't know.

He sounded a little
bit hostile, actually.

He didn't sound real friendly,

"Hey brother," you know,

so I don't know what
the fuck's going on.

Oh, now the cops hate me
and they got my name--

As long as it's another
payoff, that's all it is.

I don't know what
the fuck it is.

I don't know what they
found on my background file.

No trap for
David High, too high?

Yeah, this is too high.

I think Roland buys
it, stupid bastard.

Coming back to the nude beach.

No worries at all
at the nude beach.

Bala the coconut
boy's hard at work,

and Tony's
entertaining the crowd.

What do you call a
lesbian from Alaska?

Klondyke.

And now I've got a new plan

for getting footage of
all these nude people.

There's a lot of them out today,

and some of them are pretty hot.

This time me and Roland
are going to make

like a pair of gay tourists.

He'll pretend to take
romantic home video

of me at the seaside,

while he's really getting
shots of the naked ladies.

I guess 40 years of tabloid
taught me something worthwhile.

Hi!

I'm a fucking genius.

Ah, good to see you again.

Good to see you.

It's the beauty who
turned down 50 bucks

to take her clothes
off, for free!

Maybe our luck's
changing for the better.

Aloha.

Then again, maybe it's not.

Back in Pahoa, Surfer
Dave's got another

spy station on my doorstep.

In my book he's public
enemy number one.

At least the other fuckers,

at least they delivered.

They said it was good,
and it is really good,

and at least they
freaking delivered.

They didn't take
the money and run,

although they tried to.

And it looks like I
might be under siege

a little longer than I'd hope.

That fucker Kimo's rented
our lava-front guesthouse

to someone else.

Now, I got to break
the news to Roland.

How am I going to do that?

This is going to send
him over the edge.

I can't take it anymore.

I'm going to have
to find a new pad, pronto.

Aloha!

Hello, my love.

Hello there, nice to see you.

Oh, good to see you again.

You look fabulous, darling.

My search leads to Tara.

She drives me up the coast
to another rental house.

It's kind of like Kimo's place,

only a whole lot better.

Two bedrooms, two
baths, lush gardens,

a nice koi pond out back,

the Pacific out front,

and that nude beach just
a walk down the sand.

Mm, this is nice.

We seal the deal with a joint.

For a grand,
including utilities!

What did you do to deserve this?

I don't know.

I think it's what I didn't do.

Oh, okay.

Roland's pretty excited.

How did this happen?

I don't know.

I'm just a lucky guy.

Roland's a lucky guy, too.

He gets the downstairs.

The bad news is
he'll have to stay

at the Bates Motel
a little longer,

until his bathroom's finished.

Coming slowly, slowly.

He actually takes
it better than I expected.

I've realized something.

We were supposed to be
passing through here,

getting video of the locals,

then moving on to shoot the
next stop in the travelogue.

Instead, I'm
becoming one of them.

Kind of part of the family now.

Yeah, kind of like
the Manson family.

These people are
crazier than I am.

It'll kill you.

A raggedy bunch of refugees

from civilization
and the drug war.

Social misfits, dropouts,

living in huts they
built themselves.

No electricity,
no TV or internet,

just cheap land where they
can grow their own food.

And pot.

Be careful of the big hole.

This hole is easily,
I don't know,

several cars wide and long.

It's enormous.

And my dad always had
a chance of growing,

you know, huge crowds
of something down there.

One of the more
intriguing characters

in this community
is Share Christie.

You know, there's a
lot of purple sheep here.

People that didn't quite fit

in the communities
on the continent,

and they've come here
to just live their life

as peaceful as they could.

She ran for mayor
of Hilo in 2010,

the same year feds busted
pot advocate, Roger Christie.

Yeah, that's right, he's
her fucking husband.

I really should take some
time to think about that.

But, there's exciting
new drugs to discover.

They grind it up, blow
it in people's faces,

and it turns them into zombies.

They'll help you rob your house.

This is the zombie
drug, I heard of that.

This is the extra, oh wow!

Fast forward 12 hours.

What is that?

Holy shit, what
the fuck is that?

And what the fuck was that?

I don't
know, what the fuck was it?

You saw it, and it's crazy.

Oh, I love you, Dave!

Oh, Alien Tom, my brother!

All these people,
they look at me,

I don't know why they
look at me like they do,

but they need to be nice,

they need to be keepers.
- You're an alien.

Well yeah, obviously, I guess,

I'm not like anybody
else, but that's--

Well, you know, I'm
friendly to aliens.

What do you make
of these humans?

They are not observant,

and they have no idea
what they're doing.

What's going to happen, man?

They're not going to
get into the bomb shelter.

And I found a way
to save Hawaii.

And we're going to keep this,

but I found a way.

What we have to do is,

Hawaii can make everyone
else not relevant.

They could build the best,
newest bomb shelters,

the most high tech bomb
shelters in the world,

just for the locals and
preferred customers.

I was drawn here
by the drumming.

Heard the drumming
and the whistling,

and wanted to find
the source of it.

Then, as the sun begins
to set, I meet the E girl.

E, I like E!

How about hashish?

I like E!

Wants ecstasy, you
know, that's like code

for fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

What the fuck are you doing?

I like that song.

Do you like it?

I missed the entire
conversation there,

it looked really good--

What the fuck is going on?

I can feel movement
in the dead zone.

Massive quantities
of pot and beer

and that South
American zombie drug

have stripped me
of all my defenses.

What would you like?

He's not that young.

E for tonight.

Any suspecting
individuals around here?

I don't know, who's this?

Hey!

He doesn't want to be on camera.

He's intelligent, though.

Or maybe he does, okay.

Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, nudge,

say no more, say no more.

I'm running around to whoever

and seeing if they've
got any ecstasy for her.

You're kidding.

No.

Find some E man, let me know.

It's hard to find.

Ecstasy's hard to get.

You know, it's not the sort
of thing I do that often.

I only do it when I have sex.

We will be high
and looking sharp

and smiling at us and
saying, "Are you okay,

even though I know your high?"

And you'll say,
"Yeah, I'm fine!"

How's that, is that a good date?

I love it!

Television series?

What television series?

You're rolling?

Looks good, yeah.

Hello.

Well, here it is.

Here it is.

Who would have thunk it, hey?

Yeah really, who would have?

We were smoking, we're drinking,

we're taking every pill known
to man, I think, as I recall.

Such as?

I don't know what
the fuck they were,

but they were good, you know.

It's coming in.

She's a Seventh-day Adventist,

Blood of Christ,
Blood of Christ.

* I went to Hilo

* To see the volcano

* I met a Hawaiian girl

* She presented me
with lei lehua *

Refill.

What time is it, five o'clock?

That's 4:20 up there.

After a long night
in the cold light of day,

I offer the E girl a screen test

for my television series.

Now you can get up out of bed.

Don't look at me.

Just get up as if you're
getting up, like that.

Hold on, do that again.

And then you just get
up, put your robe on,

and walk out of shot.

Hold on, when I say action.

Lay down first, you're sleeping.

Okay, okay, okay, up you get.

Oh, morning.

Oh god, at least
it's sunny today.

Oh, oh shit.

Okay.

Good.

Turn around and look
straight in the camera

and hold your gaze,
and don't blink.

Again.

Do I have to smile or what?

No.

Fuck!

Only on your eyes.

Okay, damn.

My eyes can't smile,
they got to be serious.

What you want my eyes to do?

What do you want
them to express?

What would you like?

A little surprise--

Surprise?
Turn that way,

Turn your head, no,
not so far, a little back.

Okay, now I'm going
to be in closer.

Just turn and do the same thing.

Hold your stare next time.

Okay, that was really good.

Do it again.

Surprise, right?

You do want surprise.

I'm hungry now.

That's very good.

One more, is that it?

I'll buy you
lunch, I'll buy you lunch.

Will it be a fucking wrap?

Come on.

You got a crooked picture

over there in the background.

Should we straighten that?

That's okay.

Okay, one more time
doing a bit faster.

Just one more time.

Oh, stop it!
- You're killing me!

Oh, Jesus!

This is like fucking
Greta Garbo, come on.

I just need some value.

That's why they all took
drugs, I know why now.

Turn and just
look at the camera.

Keep looking at the camera.

Oh God, please.

Someone else can star in
tonight's nightmare.

So, I got the fuck out
of there, thank good.

Fucking gone, you know,
some other poor bastard

can deal with this.

My bender was just beginning.

On the way home I stop in
Pahoa for a half stuck.

I stumble into the
local boutique,

still fixated on that
screen test idea.

Shake it for me, babies!

Jesus Christ!

Come on.

Oh, come on, come on.

Okay.

The camera loves you.

She's great!

This is HD camera, too.

Well, that's good to know.

I was feeling like I
wasn't photogenic at all.

Totally photogenic,
come over here for one moment.

Okay,
one more, and then I'm done.

I want you to just
lean down, that's it, oh!

Aren't they amazing?

Okay, what breasts?

I don't see any breasts.

Oh, my God!

This is your brain on drugs.

Oh, my God.

Can you do what she did?

What did she do?

Not going to do it,
I'm not going to do it!

Oh, come on now,
cuz I might not have got it.

Give it to me one more time.

You can only if you're
going to put money in there.

It's going to
make you a lot of money.

Your store will be
absolutely mobbed.

Put some money in there.

Do that one more time.

Give me some money.

All right.

Of course, it went into
the night, another night.

I know you're buying
me a drink, right?

You're buying me a
stiff nog, right?

I'll buy you a stiff anything.

So, is this your camera man?

I guess you can call him that.

I have other names for him.

Do that again.

Can you get that low angle, man?

And will you do that again?

I'm thirsty.

Kind of just slow.

I might, I'm thirsty, though.

Bend down and touch your toes.

I mean, I'm thirsty, though.

Okay, what do you want?

Home at last.

Oh God, fucking
morning after, man.

Sipping bear and
it's not even 8:30.

I been lost in the Pahoa
triangle for two days

since meeting the E girl.

What's that, from last night?

No, that's the one,
I opened it and forgot.

I thought, shit, that
beer went down fast!

And I'm still fucked up.

Where's that fucking
pot delivery man?

It's 8:30, he was supposed
to be here at eight o'clock.

Drying, huh?

Yeah, home delivery.

I'm really settled
in out here now.

Is there a delivery charge?

There's a delivery charge
even when they don't deliver!

It costs me half the stash

just to get it pried out
of their greedy little

fucking grasping hand.

You know, it's like
Charles Dickens in Hawaii.

You know, really.

More please, may I have more?

Oliver Twist.

Which one first?

Help me make up my mind.

Will I have a long
blip, or a Longboard?

Here, this one's half done.

I might as well finish that
before I start the other one.

What a fucking night.

I'm sleeping on the couch
with a woman telling me

how she had a fucking
hammer embedded in her head,

and then giving me the details

of how the doctors
couldn't get it out,

and they're using like a
jackhammer on her head.

No kidding, it was
like I couldn't sleep.

I fell off the couch.

You slept on a couch?

With her, yeah, it was
the only bed in the place.

I don't know, Dave,

it seems like you're
quite popular in town.

I don't know.

What is it?

I don't know, I guess,
I really don't know.

I buy them drinks!

I buy them drinks and drugs.

The way to a girl's heart!

I don't want a heart, I
want the tits, oh yes!

What a man will go through
to grope a set of tits, huh?

I'm disgusting,
I disgust myself.

Sometimes I make myself so sick.

Now my lighter won't work.

Oh, fuck.

What's the plan today?

I don't know, I guess I'm
going to get hagged again.

The hag net? No, don't do it!

Don't do it, Dave!

I can't help it!

Don't do it!

I can't help it!

You know, I even
attracted hags like,

you know, iron shavings.

They stick to me,
they work like gum.

Don't know what it is.

What have I got, what is it?

You know, they're too old,
not pretty, they love me.

Guess I pay them
attention, I think.

That's the secret.

You know, fawn all
over them, lie to them,

tell them they're
fucking beautiful.

Ejaculate and get the fuck
out of there.

Wipe off the DNA off the table!

I should have
listened to Roland,

taken his advice and dried up.

Instead, I'm right
back at the bar.

Ah, aloha, aloha!

Aloha!

Aloha.

Aloha!

Suddenly I see
Roland's rental car,

and I realize he's following me.

Fuck you, you son of a bitch!

Come here, you fucker, yeah!

There's a cop down there.

I don't care!

You're going to get arrested.

I'm not smoking.

You're fucked up!

I've never seen
Roland so fucking pissed.

Come on, want to go?

I remind him I know
feng shui, and it's over.

Maybe for good.

It's been close to a week
since Roland's intervention.

It didn't work.

My round the clock binge
is entering day 10.

And I don't know where
the fuck Roland is.

He hasn't picked up my calls,

or returned my messages.

For all I know, my designated
driver's back in LA.

Great.

Oh freedom, I can't let you go.

So, it's just me and
my little HD cam.

But the way my
hands are shaking,

I could probably
use a steady cam.

What did he say?
Coconut culture?

Coconut culture, herbalology.

Herbanomics.

Herbanomics!

I figure maybe Tony
can take over Roland's gig.

How do I do it?

Just frame me up, it's rolling.

Oh, okay.

You're going to love this one.

Very slowly, while
you were drinking it,

I went to it and it's
just the top of Bala,

and Bala's taking
a hit off the pipe

and all you see is the
top so Bala's head,

and he's smoking off the pipe!

But you're still drinking,
I was like real slow,

and I'm like, and then you
see Bala in the background.

You're going to love that,
you're going to love what I did!

Roland who? Who needs that fuck?

You realize you've interrupted
my work here, don't you?

Severely,
but you needed a break.

It's LeAnn, the tile lady,

working on what was going
to be Roland's bathroom.

That's the great fucking secret.

You cough like me!

I did need a break, yeah.

You were exhausted.

You know what?

These two hour days
are killing me!

You know what?

After a joint and
a couple of beers,

LeAnn looks pretty good for 68.

You look good on camera,
you have good lines.

I doubt it.

God, you're awfully close there.

I wonder what
she looks like at 69.

Start the tea.

It's a damn fine joint.

Oh, it's huge!

All the girls say that!

The rest is easy.

Would you like to do
a screen test for me?

No.

Really? It's really nothing.

It's easy, it'll take two
minutes, it's painless.

You simply disrobe, I'll
see how you look on camera.

Right!

What do you think?

Yeah, yeah, then what do I do

after I get the
rejection notice?

Would you like a beer?

No, I wouldn't.

You sure?

Yeah.

It'll relax you
for your screen test.

No, I don't need
to be that relaxed.

You don't?

Are you comfortable doing

a nude screen test
for me, my dear?

Not at all, not at all!

You don't mind?

Would you?

He takes no for an answer!

Oh, you said no?

He takes no.

Oh, I thought
you were saying yes.

LeAnn, my sweet!

Stay back!

We have to think
of something new!

Did you say yes or no?

I said no, N-O!

Now, hold on, we set it up,

we've got the suspense now.

If you did this, you would
be the star of an art movie.

So boring.

Okay, you had your chance!

So boring!

This is how Marilyn
Monroe got discovered.

What if she said no?

That's a hell of a
shower you got there.

Have you seen my
shower upstairs?

Yes, I have.

Would you like to see it again?

No, I wouldn't.

You're not very good at this!

Thank God the E girl's
not finished with me yet.

Hey, come here
for one sec, love.

Sweetie!

Please help me.

I'm trying to work
out this camera.

I need you, please.

Please, what have I
done for you lately?

Nothing!

Okay, walk in here, let me test.

I won't use it without your
permission, I promise you.

You love me.

Just come in here, come in here.

Walk this way.

I've got to see if this works.

No, I am not going to
bare my fucking makeup--

You don't,
you've got a towel on.

I am not going to be makeup-less

on to the LA camera, no way.

Are we on?

I'm dressed, yes I'm dressed.

You want me to buy this?

Well, I think so.

I do look very hard.

It's very difficult
to be on camera.

No, just say it's real hard.

It's just really hard.

And right back here,
on the back of his neck.

Eeough, Eeough!

It looks like a little,
almost like a mosquito bite.

Oh shit, and
that's how it starts out.

Turned out big as a basketball.

Cover me up!

And the party's just started.

Well, I just got here, man!

You're my favorite martian!

Much love, brother!

Oh, brother!

It's the alien.

He's a Jezy freak like I am,

he's a Jezy freak like
I am, a Jezy freak!

And Daryl, some
guy the E girl knows.

She's naked and everything!

And he's got more
refreshments at his place.

Best that you
have, big or small,

it's not what you got.

Per usual, no
electricity or running water,

but refreshments
are going to do.

That's Andrea, Daryl's wife.

That's the E girl,
hitting on Daryl.

That's me hitting on Andrea.

That's the alien
hitting on the E girl.

Looks like we've
got us a love-in.

Andrea, just smoke it.

Okay, now Andrea it's your turn!

Everything's
going just as planned.

Thank you Lord, you are good!

David, your life is errant,
and we are the cloud.

We are the cloud, brother.

We are at 700 megahertz,
we are the cloud.

We own the world in a word.

We can stop it
all with a breath,

because we know how to
mix the words they can't.

We are the future.

We're on the island.

Fucking right
on, we are gypsies!

We are nomads,

and no land is our
nomad land, right?

We are fucking gypsies!

They're fucked up,
they are so fucked!

Like that, I can read the
dots and read the zone zeros.

Biometric code is.

Fuck you!

That's not even a way
not to do the job, mama.

* I went to Hilo

* To see the volcano

* I met a Hawaiian girl

* She presented me
with lei lehua *

Day 12 and my
binge is rudely interrupted.

An unexpected phone call
from Share Christie.

Okay, well is there a chance
could get together today?

She says she wants to
discuss something, in person.

It sounds serious.

I sure hope she hasn't gone
online and found my bio.

We meet at a popular spot

where drinking for 12 hours
straight is smiled upon,

and where the no-smoking
signs ban cigarettes,

but not pot.

It's known as the healing pool.

A kind of local Lourdes,

where the sick come
seeking miracles

from the magic waters.

Hi, nice to meet you.

Aloha.

And Share Christie
could use a miracle.

She and her husband Roger
are facing up to 40 years

in the federal pen in
that THC Ministry case.

They're among 14 people charged
with marijuana trafficking.

Everyone but Roger
got out on bail.

He's been locked up

for more than four
years without a trial.

From the third time that
he was let out on bail,

I said, "Oh my God, he
is a political prisoner."

Oh, I guess
Share did look up my bio.

She wants me to get some
national attention on the case.

Listen up, I'd going
to talk to him.

I call Roland again,

and leave a voice mail about
the Christie development.

This is a really
good one for Geraldo,

he loves legal shit like this.

This time he picks up in
the middle of the message,

around the part
where I mention money

and selling the story to one
of the big TV news shows.

But Roland interrupts and
tells me to stop talking.

His spyware's detected a bug.

Someone's listening in on us.

Holy shit, our fucking
phones are tapped.

Surfer Dave and Roseanne

are just two insignificant
memories now.

Paranoia has taken over.

Then again, is is
paranoia if it's real?

I knew what the NSA was doing,

I just didn't know they
were doing it to me.

I'm seeing federal agents
behind trees, under rocks.

I got to get my stuff
out of the beachhouse

and get off this island
before it's too late.

Hey!

It's Tara the landlady.

Who goes there?

And what the fuck?

God, we're glad you're alive.

First time I've
seen Roland in nine days.

Nice to see you, mother fucker.

Yeah.

Thanks for
leaving me, you bastard.

Now you're back,

and I supposed you want
me to welcome you in, huh?

Well, it's up to you.

Fuck you.

Just got to be sure this
isn't another AA intervention.

Oh, I missed you my boy!

Come in.

I missed you, man.

I guess not.

You don't bring beer
to an intervention.

But this is worse.

Roland and Tara are an item.

I missed you, brother.

I'm so glad you got here.

I was worried, I
thought, no, shit.

These are from Tara.

I thought I told
him I wanted to fuck her.

Fucking prick.

You fuck.

How could you do that?

You fucking piece of shit.

Since he went AWOL on me,

that sneaky
bastard's been living

at her island spread, rent free.

This is my
new room at the estate.

It's really incredible.

That's it, that's it, you know,

he settled down with Tara,

have a nice, happy
fucking life, you know.

Be Tara's bat boy,

and you know, I'll get
back to see my kid.

You know, maybe get a job as
a Walmart greeter somewhere.

On the plus side,

I won't be hearing him whine

about the Bates Motel anymore.

And I do have my shooter back.

Oh, that sick face.

Hold on, go back a bit.

With this new contraption
he's rigged up,

he's looking more
like a gynecologist.

What's the plan?

What's a plan?

And all you have to do is say,

"I knew I should have
brought the gas mask."

I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

That's good.

Look at that.

I might have to wind
it around a bit later.

Still fucking make
out what it is!

Now you're starting
to look like Colonel Sanders.

Right.

I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

He's starting to look
like Colonel Sanders.

Flat.

Yeah, flat.

I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

He's starting to look
like Colonel Sanders.

I knew I should
have brought the gas mask.

He's starting to look
like Colonel Sanders.

That's it, that's the believer.

That's the one that
works, we got you.

We got plenty to cut
with, have a look at it.

Once the tests are
out of the way,

I bring him up to date on
the latest developments.

Yeah, what was I going to say?

I don't know.

Can't fucking remember,
it was important.

It's not just the
phones being tapped.

I think my laptop's been hacked

because Share Christie
went and put me

on her husband's
prison email list.

There's some deep,
dark fucking conspiracy

going on with this.

On the street, at the
beach, wherever I go,

I feel I'm being watched.

Aloha.

And they don't look
like Surfer Dave's spies.

They look like those
law enforcement types.

This is very
fucking frightening.

It's like the rise of
the goddamn Fourth Reich.

Now Share's ready
to spill her guts

on the marijuana church
and puke all over the DEA.

I don't want anything
to do with this shit.

You know what that says?

Dot dash dash dash dot, SOS!

Get my fucking foot weights now!

All I want to do is
direct naked screen tests

and get fucked up.

And then it hits me.

The booze, the pot, the drugs,

the sex, the paranoia.

I don't know if I'm
sweating from an overdose,

fear, or the fucking humidity.

Fuck this humidity.

In two showers I'm
still soaking wet.

I don't know what it is.

It could be the alcoholism,

I could have TB,
dengue fever, scurvy.

Anyway, this is a trick I found

that is effective
in the tropics,

you know, especially when

your girlfriend's
about to come over.

You don't have time
to take a shower.

Some nutcase turns
up on your door.

You just do this,

and it pretty much, you know,

freshens you up pretty good.

Is that an old outback trick?

I don't know.

Yeah, my dad taught me.

This is good, too.

I don't want to go anywhere
near the Christie's

or their marijuana church.

I don't want to
piss off the DEA.

I need a break.

I want to get the
fuck out of here.

I'm scared.

Mummy, I want my mummy!

But Roland sees money in it.

So, I tail off and
head back to my source.

My Deep Shit.

Well, this was a
place of empowerment.

There's a reason he
wants to stay anonymous.

He was one of the first
ministers ordained

into Roger Christie's
THC church.

Roger has
always been quite brilliant.

He was in the
military in the 70's.

He was trained to be
military intelligence.

Being that he was
trained to be CIA,

and that he was
pushing the envelope

where people were
going into court cases

and using the
defense of sacrament,

and using cannabis
sacerdotally, and winning,

caused him to be a hot
potato, so to speak.

Reverend Deep Shit would
have been the 15th offender,

if he hadn't seen red flags

a couple of months
before the DEA moved in.

At that point,

I personally felt like it
was time to just back away,

like it was really
getting dangerous.

What, reckless people,
people doing reckless things?

Not necessarily reckless,

but attitudes as to how to
handle business changed.

Okay, I got you.

And that's
when these influences of,

this is a business
type of thing,

and hours of operation
became hours of operation

rather than an open ministry.

It all came down to this.

Roger Christie's ministry
was handing out free pot,

and raking in more than

a million dollars a
year on donations.

He was just too successful
for his own good.

When you start
messing with people's money

on those levels, people get mad,

and they're going to go
after the figurehead,

they're going to go after
the head of the dragon.

Could it get any more fucked up?

What the hell
happened last night?

I'm in fear for my life,

and Roland's living as a
kept man at ChÃƒÂ¢teau Tara.

That remote
control's not for a TV.

That's for my bed.

It's fucking leave it
to fucking beaver, isn't it?

Oh, look at the happy family!

I'm going to
rinse these just in case.

I feel like the
spare prick at a wedding.

Don't touch me, I'm sterile.

They actually forced me to watch

a home movie they made together.

And maybe slightly
a little bit in love.

At first I want to puke.

Then I go into shock.

This is Roland,
now on his seventh shot.

No way, seven?

Wow, that's smooth.

In the entire
time I've known him,

I've never known
Roland to drink a drop.

And here on your eighth shot,

Roland is not yet
slurring his words.

And here he
is, wasted on tequila.

That's good, that's good.

He's getting pot, a
little skin, some fur,

a good combination.

And I can't believe it.

He's actually smoking pot.

Tasty.

Yeah.

It really is tasty.

No effect, though.

Right on cue.

I'm okay.

Okay!

Well, we're going to
have to, by the way,

he's still not
slurring his words!

Roland's found a
girl, and I've lost one.

No, I hope she's not
fucking dead.

Not the E girl.

Yeah, and I could be a
suspect if there's foul play.

I had a feeling
something was wrong.

So, this is about a week
before she goes missing.

Hey sweetie, it's Catherine!

And I got this one, too.

I'm clean and
sober for a week now.

I got anointed by my
girlfriend from church.

She did the John
the Baptist on me

and we moved 47
spirits out of me.

It was amazing!

So, I feel really clear.

No more alcohol for a week

since I got arrested.

Fuck, what if it's a hit?

And what if I'm
going to get framed

because of the Christie's
and the marijuana church.

It's a little bit
disturbing, Roland.

My fears escalate when
Share Christie shows up

at the beach house to
talk about the case.

I get it.

The feds don't like
Roger Christie.

Eight times denied bail.

Why was he denied bail?

They say he's a
danger to his community.

We want to know whose community,

cuz it isn't ours.

Something's very wrong here.

They must be
really scared of him.

I think they must
be or something.

It's very odd.

Done all kinds of things
like mirrored the computer,

tapped the phone, and all that.

So, now she tells me.

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

10, 11 beers, and it's
not even 10 o'clock.

It doesn't matter how
many beers I drink now.

Even the pot's not working
on me, has no effect.

I'm un-sedatable.

I got to get back to LA, and
get the fuck out of here.

I don't have many options

before I'm framed,
busted, or killed.

My final wish is that Roland
completes the travel show.

I don't know, this could
be the last hurrah for me.

This shall be my masterpiece.

My finest work!

Oh yes, they shall
remember Dave High.

And I grant Roland what could
be my last interview, ever.

I don't get it, Dave.

Why does everyone
have to be nude?

Do it again.

Just say flat, "Why does
everyone have to be nude?"

Why does
everyone have to be nude?

It's never really
let me down, Roland.

Oh, and sex sells,

and you got to go for
that shot, you know?

Sex, nudity, bestiality, incest,

nothing's out of bounds,

and I'm prepared to go anywhere.

You know, it's a
shock proof society,

and I can't shock them
the way I used to.

You know, that just
means what I used to do

doesn't shock anyone anymore.

So now I'm going to
go for the shock,

nothing's out of the
question, you know.

I believe in nude, you know.

It's naked, sex,
drugs, booze, idiocy,

horrible degenerate stuff.

I mean, that's what
people want to see.

Give them all they fucking want.

Why do you like
getting fucked up so much?

Do it again.

Why do you like
getting fucked up so much?

I just do it, you know,

you fucking live till you die.

Yeah, it'll kill you,

but it won't kill you any
quicker than anything else.

You know, cigarettes,
booze, pot,

mushrooms, drugs, acid,

step right up, step right up.

You know, it's just a
bit of a fucking joke,

you know, just people
forgot to laugh.

Have you ever
thought about going to rehab?

Do it again, lower, flatter,

"You ever thought about
going into rehab?"

Have you ever
thought about going to rehab?

It's the woman
who got the hammer

stuck in her head.

She's drunk and wants me to
meet her at Uncle Robert's.

Roland's happy to get rid of me.

He drops me there.

I could always
sleep on the beach.

Will you come get
me in the morning?

Once before I die

I want to lay on my
back on the black sand,

look up at the moon and stars,

and get some hammerhead.

It's Monday
morning, about eight o'clock.

I have no idea where Dave is.

We left him over there
near the lava fields,

and he was going to spend
the night on the beach.

Went over there, can't find him.

We have no idea where he's at.

I'm just backtracking from
where we left him last night.

Have you seen Dave?

No, I haven't seen Dave.

Have you seen Dave?

No.

Have you seen Dave?

No.

Have you seen Dave?

Have you seen Dave?

Dave who?

And no sign of hammerhead,

either the woman I left
him with last night,

I only got a quick
glimpse of her.

I don't know who she
is, or where she lives.

I'll go take a second look.

I hope everything's okay.

The town folks have
mounted a search party,

and drug-sniffing dogs are
trying to pick up Dave's scent.

I'm really getting worried now,

he's been gone over 12 hours.

He may have fallen in the ocean,

or swept away by the high tide.

I couldn't find him.

What happened to him?

Who knows?

He could be dead, you know.

I think you're right,

the waves, the tides.

Oh no, don't say that!

with that cat there
