Hello, my name is Ethan Hawke,
and I just wanted to talk to you briefly

about the new film
I'm working on

called <i>Zeros and Ones,</i>
by Abel Ferrara.

I've been a fan of Abel since I
first fell in love with the movies.

He's a completely unique
and extraordinary filmmaker.

He's got voice with the camera.
He has depth with his actors.

The work that he's done most recently with
Willem Dafoe has been wildly inspiring to me,

so I was very grateful
to get the script.

Especially considering that the
script speaks to this moment.

Not in any obvious,
uh, didactic way,

but you can feel
that this is Abel's hit

on what we've all been going
through for the last year or so.

Uh, it's a beautiful script.
I play a military man.

You're not exactly sure whether
I'm a good guy or a bad guy,

and I also play my own brother,
who's a revolutionary.

And so, that's very dynamic
for me to get to play

these two characters that are
representing contrasting viewpoints.

I think we're gonna be able
to do something really special.

Uh, I consider the most
important aspect of my job,

who I choose to work with,
that's what actors do.

You know, we champion filmmakers,
uh, we champion voices.

And I'm excited for the world
to see Abel's response

to-to this wild year
we've been living through.

I hope you enjoy it.

Still here.

<i>All right, here,
let me pull it up.</i>

<i>Hey, let me... let me
work with this some more.</i>


[bus engine revving]


You're still alive.

You trust it?

[soft chuckle]
Come on.

[receding footsteps]

[car doors close]

[car engine revving]

That's the news to the world.

[man, voice-over] <i>It is

<i>The religion of sincerity.</i>

[Valeria clicking tongue]

[child crying]

His father?

Your brother...

is still in prison.

Well, at least he's alive.


Are you sure?



Is that your rabbit?

Does he have a name?

What are you dreamin' about?

Fish?

Porcupines?

Goodnight.

I only have tea.

That's fine.

[tea pouring]

Have you figured out
what you're doing in my country?

I'm workin' on it.

Lots of honey?

[JJ] Mm-hm.
Right.

What's with you
Americans and honey?

You don't care
if he ever gets out.


He won't last
ten minutes on the street,

knowin' what he knows.

How do they know what he knows?

You told them?

[JJ breathes deeply]


[phone ringing]

[woman over phone]
<i>I heard you're back.</i>

<i>Show him.</i>

<i>And they're both negative.</i>

[bus engine revving]

[loud knock on door]


[bottle sprays]


[snapping fingers]

He's addicted to the screens.

In another time and place,
it could be castor oil,

and I'd call you <i>partigiano.</i>

Made in Swiss...

made popular in San Francisco,

and perfected recently by a chef
not far from here.

It's quicker and more effective.


No... you don't...

[gasping for air]


Where?

Where... and when?

Okay?

It takes more than guns
to kill a man.

You think I'm your enemy?

Yeah, is that what you think?

Your fear made me,
and now, here I am.

I am your enemy, but your enemy
won't be gone when you kill me.

You can't kill me.

Try it, watch what happens.

I'll be right back after the
sound and the fury is finished.

Where, and when?

Come on.

This machine kills fascists.

This machine is my voice.
It's the human voice.

My heart is the drummer...
Okay, all right.

You wanna know... you wanna know
where the door is, eh?


[Justin sniffs, laughs]

No, wait, wait.

I'll tell you...

I'll tell you...
I'll tell you...

I'll tell you where the...
where the door...

I'll meet you...
I'll meet you there.

And I'm not afraid to die.

And you?

You're dead already.

I would light myself on fire!

How come no one is lighting
themselves on fire, eh?!

<i>How come no one is lighting
themselves on fire anymore?!</i>

This country
was conceived in liberty,

dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

This is a battleground.

The world is watching
what happens here,

and it is up to us,
the living...

to finish the work of the dead

so they will
not have died in vain

and that a government
of the people, for the people,

by the people, shall not perish
from this earth!

Hail Caesar! Hail Augustus Caesar
'cause he-he got it, he got it.

And you-you, are you American?
You're American, right?

I can't see him,
behind his mask!

Are you American?

<i>â™ª One Sunday morning â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª By the relief office â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I saw my people â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They stood there hungry â™ª</i>

<i>You know the song!</i>

<i>Are you American?</i>

<i>â™ª One Sunday morning â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª By the shadow
of the steeple â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª By the relief office â™ª</i>

nature, nature's God.

We hold these truths
to be self-evident

that all men are created equal
and that they are endowed

with certain unalienable rights:

Life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

Do you know who said that?

Who knows who said it,
raise their hand.

It wasn't one man,
yet you wanna kill one man.

All right, all right, all right.

You wanna know
where the door is.

Didn't you find it?

When you were
rifling through my bag?

Writing my suicide note?

come up with that idea, huh?

You learn that
from your scoutmaster now?

Are you guys Boy Scouts?
Do you swear to be faithful and true, huh?

Huh? Don't you even know
that your strippers are Marxist?

Your shoemakers are my soldiers?

That your cameraman
is my brother, huh?

Nobody living's ever going to stop
me from walking the freedom highway.

Nobody living's gonna
make me turn back

'cause this land
was made for you and me.

You don't know
how to work with wood.

You don't love it, huh?

You hate trees, that's why you hate me...
Okay.

No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no!

Ah, fuck! Oh!

Oh, please, Lord,
grant me the courage

to love those who hate me
so that we may change the world.

Oh, please, Lord, grant me the courage...
[men chanting in Arabic]

...to love those who hate me
so that we may change the world.

Grant me the courage to love those who
hate me so that we may change the world.

[chanting continues]

[JJ sighs]

So when is this gonna happen?

It has been happening
for a thousand years.


He was born here.

Do you remember how you felt when
you first put on that uniform?

I felt useful.

Did your brother
ever wear a uniform?

No.

[intense snare drum beat]

We had a deal.

Oh, my American friend.

Always talking about a deal.

Hm.

You still wearing your vest?

At all times, Captain.

So how are things with you?

You tell me.

Stop playing games,
imperialist.

You worship it.

It is time to live it.

Oh.

Where is he?

In training.


[windows shatters]
[door explodes]

Don't move!
[speaking in foreign language]

Don't move!
I said, don't fucking move!


[clattering]
[indistinct shouting]





[gasping for air]


You think we're playing
fucking games?

[man breathing heavily]



Everything you need to know is on
this, in five languages.

Get it?

[speaking Arabic]

Study it, destroy it,
make it happen.

[speaks Arabic]


[woman speaking in Russian]

[all laughing]


[woman speaking in Russian]

Oh... [laughs]

[speaking in Russian]

It's funnier in Russian.
[woman] Yeah.

[speaking in Russian]


That's happenin' here
in real time.

The waiter's filmin' this.

The last thing he'll ever do.



And the other guy?

His boss.

I want to drink
for our future big success.

[American ambassador]
Very good.

[woman laughs]

To our friendship.
Yes.

they could be sisters.</i>

Know them?

Your brother's dead.

We're negotiatin' for his body.

how he wants to die?</i>

<i>I paid dearly for the words
you put into my mouth.</i>

<i>You fooled me
that I can see the hereafter.</i>

[church choir singing]

[door creaks open]

[preaching in foreign language]

[no audible dialogue]


It was told to me
from the Holy Father...

in his prayer.

He wants you
to initiate the response.

Ask help from no one.

They will all betray you.

They will deny
you even existed.

Do you know
what happened to my brother?


He sits with his father now.

[footsteps]
[breathing heavily]

[coughing in distance]


<i>Aiutami!</i>

<i>Aiutami!</i>

Okay, soldier boy,
hands up!

Drop the gun.

Nice and easy.

Get in the car.

[man and woman
speaking in Russian]


Hey, relax!

We're all negative here!

[speaking in Russian]


When was the last time
you did some giga giga?


[speaking in Russian]

Here's the deal:

You knock her up
and you walk out of here.

How's that gonna work?

He's a doctor.

We have methods.

Call it advanced medicine.

Now turn that
fucking camera on.

Jesus.</i>

For you.

<i>Being out of uniform

[laughing continues]

<i>Listen, soldier, convening with
the enemy is a serious offense.</i>

<i>Can you understand that?</i>

<i>When?</i>

<i>When?</i>

keeping this to yourself?</i>

Have you talked to Steven?

<i>You just got him killed.</i>


<i>Your brother was an anarchist.</i>

<i>Your brother was a communist.</i>


My brother
was a revolutionary.

We gotta get out of here.
Where?

New York?

Shit.

[stairs clanking]

[intense music playing]

When?

Right now.

Get the baby.

It's on.

Thank God.

[no audible dialogue]

Well, the movie's over.

Uh, when I first
spoke to you, um,

I was really
just recording a video

to help raise money
to make the movie.

And now, uh,
we've made the film!

And I just watched it,
and you just watched it.

When Abel gave me the script
and, uh...

script is a really, uh,
not accurate term for what he sent.

I really didn't understand
a word of it...

Yeah.

But I really liked it.
[soft chuckle]

Uh, I did, but I didn't know
what was happening.

I felt like somebody
was up to something,

and that I wanted to be
a part of it,

but I didn't know
what he was trying to say.

And now,
after watching the film,

I think what I began to feel
while we're making it is true.

Which is that you're...

You can have kind of two
opposing outlooks on the world

and that they're both accurate.

You kind of can
align your shoulders one way

in which you realize you wake up
in the morning and you think,

"Oh, shit, I'm gonna die.

I mean, this is real.
I'm gonna die."

And the world is run

by corrupt, greedy individuals

and there's great tragedy
and disease

and the planet is eroding.

And not only am I gonna die,
everybody I know is gonna die.

And brothers lie to each other,
and people hurt each other.

And you just... you just don't know if you
can go on, or what the point of it all is.

And then almost
with-with the same ease,

you can align your shoulders
a different direction and go,

"I was born! Why was I born?
I'm so glad I was born.

Everybody was born,
and the sun comes up and there're flowers.

And guess what,
a lot of people are really nice!"

And there's a kind of
pervasive kindness and healing

that runs through the world
as it spins away.

And there's all this
tremendous beauty!

Every child is a miracle

and I wonder why I was born,
you know.

What I'm doing.

Both those outlooks
are a hundred percent true.

This is part of the movie,
by the way.

And now it's over.
