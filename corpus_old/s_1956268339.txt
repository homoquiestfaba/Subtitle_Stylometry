        Whoa!

   Look out!
                   Look out!

              -Aah!
              -Aah!

How dare thee show a noble lady
of the court such disrespect!

                  Aw, man!
             We hit a princess!

             Grrrrr!

         Come on, dude.
          We gotta go!

      These Ren-fair people
       are way too extra!

              -Pig!
              -Aah!

              -Huh!
              -Uhh!

        Such impropriety!
            Servants!

     To think such ruffians
 could so easily accost a lady.

                  The king
           will hear about this!

      Your Highness, I had
 the most distressing encounter

         with a pair of
        strange vagrants.

                     Oh?
  Distressing vagrants, you say?

           It's always something
             with you, Princess.

I fear the safety of the kingdom
       may be compromised.

Out of my way, ladies!

        Security's fine.

                         Uh...
     H-Hi?

               Oh!

 'Twas them, milord!

   Don't worry about it, kid.

 The kingdom's plenty safe with
 security like this on the case.

      I'm sure our honored
        guest will agree.

    Ain't that right, Spooky?

How are we to punish
   the intruders?

       Come on, Princess.

      You know how we greet
   new guests to this kingdom.

            Oh, yes.
        The magic trick.

Magic trick?
                  Magic trick?

          Magic trick.

          Hoo-hoo! Ha!

      Nothing up my sleeve.

         Ooh. Anyway...

          hope you boys
      are ready for a show.

               Wh-- Waaaa....

       Don't you remember?
    You're my loyal subjects.

   And I'm the just and noble
          King Zombozo,

       lord of everything
        the light touches

             here in
   the Kingdom of Zombozelot.

      Not too shabby, huh?

Parlor tricks are of
no use to me, jester.

          Tough crowd.

Wow!
Oi, milord.

 What are our orders
to march, so to speak?

              Uh...

          Oh, I got it!
          Yoo-hoo-hoo!

      How about we make you
   my new personal attendants?

  But, my king, they should be
       <i> my</i>new attendants.

         Oh, I'm sorry.
 Which one of us is king, again?

The injustice of it all!

  Oh, the wretched unfairness!

  Expecting a lady of the court
    to maintain her standing

      with so few servants?

         Oh! Can no one
     understand my hardship?

            Uh, what?
       What am I wearing?

        Is this a forest?

      Wha-- But -- But how?

             We were
     just in the Rustbucket.

          Ben? Grandpa?

Okay, okay.

I can figure this out.

    But, first, I can't think
 with all these stupid ruffles.

              Uhh!

   First order of business --
       finding my family.

Uh, Grandpa?

           Maximus want eat pig!
         Girl make pig get away!

         Maybe Maximus eat girl!

     Uh, ha ha.
Okay, funny game, Grandpa.

Princess!

   The king has sent for you.

    You must return at once.

      Finish your business
      with this wilder-man.

             Ben? The who, now?

Forest belong to Maximus.

Very well.

               Prepare thyself
              for a trouncing.

      Do you accept defeat, dog?

Forests belong to Maximus!

                 I have had
           enough of your games!

               Away with you.

Huh?

    Am I wearing a wolf pelt?

              Gwen?
     Gwen, what's going on?

It's the reflections.
                  The what, now?

Whoa!

       Ben, what are you -- Aah!

 You have to get him
to look at his reflection.

            Uh, sure.
   Making it my top priority.

   Okay, Ben, just
calm down and -- Whoa!

   Look out, Gwen!

         Oh!
      Uh, Ben.

     You should have run off
         with your tail

              between your legs
 while you still had the chance.

           Wait. Stop!

       Thou shalt not harm
           the, uh...

          man-beast --
    by order of the princess.

             He said
    I was a princess, right?

      You side with the wildling
          over the king's guard?

                  Traitor!
                  So be it.

       The great one shall judge
       this betrayal personally.

        Uh, Ben, please.

         This is no way
        to treat family.

    Thou art no kin of mine,
           beast-man.

           I trust there will be
          no further resistance?

    What on earth
    is going on?

What's wrong with Ben?
         I have no idea.

 One minute, we're on our way to
 the Lactose Intolerance Museum.

            The next,
   I'm waking up in the woods

             wearing
     a frilly princess dress

 and watching you wrestle a pig
  in fuzzy barbarian underwear.

        Hmm.
If I didn't know better,

I'd say it sounds like
 we were hypnotized.

           Hypnotized?
        But who could --

        What am I saying?
     It's Zombozo, isn't it?

                What's this?

  Looks like someone figured out
          how to break my spell.

              Where'd you find
                a reflection?

The river!

             Oh, I knew I should
             have drained that.

        Now, please don't ignore
     our special guest of honor.

             Guest?

        I don't know what
      you two are planning,

          but you won't
       get away with this!

    Yeah, we know
how to break your --

          Silence! Don't talk to
    the king without permission.

             I did your bidding
               again, my lord.

          How do you wish for me
               to handle them?

                Hoo-hoo-hoo!

               Note to self --
       next throne, less stairs.

   Why do you even
  want to be king?

           I want to eat, relax,
        and be fancy, of course.

              Idea!
      Tell you what, kiddo.

          You're doing
        such a great job.

 How about you decide what we do
  with the prisoners this time?

              Ooh!
       He went Four Arms.

     This is gonna be good.
        He's my favorite.

                    Huh.
              It's just a hole.

Good thing Ben not that's
creative, or we'd be in trouble.

             Well, I don't care
             if he's hypnotized.

                He's grounded
                 for a week.

              Huh. What do you
              suppose that is?

It's two dozen rabid badgers
that are about to join you...

as soon as this rope
   burns through.

        For once, Ben has
        proven me wrong.

     That's really creative.

          Hey, uh, brave knight.

   I never noticed how strong
       and mighty you are.

Flattery will not stop
 the badgers, girl.

    I just mean to say, well,

        you work so hard
     to protect the kingdom.

                   Oh, oh.
                  Uh, yeah.

              Much harder than
   the so-called king, at least.

  What game do you
  traitors play at?

       What game, indeed.

              Look.
      What's he doing now?

   I'll bet he's just having fun
      and bossing people around.

  Ah, my lord is a,
 uh, very busy man.

He --
He hasn't done anything!

  He just bosses people around
      and stuffs his face.

It's true. He has been partaking
in much merriment today.

               If you ask me,
    <i> you'd</i>be a way better king.

  What you speak of
sounds like treason, girl.

        Think of how much better
  it would be for the kingdom --

             big strong warrior
      like you running the show.

    A real man of the people.

Hmm.

   Yes, I believe
I see what you mean.

      Zombozo!

A true king does more
than sit on his royal duff

 and stuff his face.

                Say what, now?
Consider this a coup!

        Watch it, ya big tomato!

  Your move, clown.

                     Oh!

          Bit of advice for you,
                  kiddo --

              Come at the king,
               best not miss.

        Whoa!

         Oh!

                    Aah!

What kind of trickery
      is this?

               Magic trickery.

  Whoa!
                Come on, kid.

               You're supposed
              to be hypnotized.

       Get back on Team Zombozo.

        Sir Ben, a little faster
               would be nice.

Overthrow him already!

You're done giving orders.

          You can't question me.

               I am your king.

        Huh?

                What the heck
                is going on?

       Hey, you guys okay?

          Why you guys
       sitting in a hole?

     Is there something cool
            in there?

    I wanna sit in the hole.

              He must have seen
     his reflection in my crown.

              How unfortunate!

           Make room.
         I'm coming in.

               What? I thought
             I had him for sure.

                  You will
             not screw this up.

                  Come on.
    We were such a great team --

              brains and brawn.

        Stop avoiding your place
    as my double-right-hand man.

Okay. Then how about
 you get over here?

Aaahhh!

            How did we end up in
   these gross Ren-fair clothes?

         This isn't what I meant
                 when I said

           I wanted more vintage
           stuff in my wardrobe.

          Let's get out of here.

      Then you turned into
      a Shock Rock knight.

           Grandpa was
       a savage barbarian.

          Yeah, you locked us up
           in a crazy trap, too.

Sounds like I was pretty
cool -- and creative.

       This is
really uncomfortable.

   How did people
wear this back then?

       Yeah, I was wearing
        some dumb dress.

              Oh, I don't know.
          I don't mind my getup.

        Great range of movement.
                Very freeing.

  No! Get your hands off of me!
          I was a king!

             A king!

      Don't fool yourself.

     You were never a king.
