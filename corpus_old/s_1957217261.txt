â™ª

is probably the most

useful theorem in geometry.

We start by drawing
the altitude

to the hypotenuse
of a right triangle.

Now, we already know
that either leg

is the geometric mean
between the hypotenuse

and the segment
of the hypotenuse

adjacent to that leg.

adjacent to that leg.
So we know that
C/A equals A/P.

So we know that
C/A equals A/P.

And C/B equals B/Q.

What's the next step?

Fuck you.

Isolate the hypotenuse.

Using the addition property
A squared plus B squared

equals CP + CQ.

And using the
distributive property;

A squared + B squared
equals CP + Q.

By substitution;
A squared + B squared

equals C squared.

â™ª

Pythagoras was right;

the square of the length
of the hypotenuse

equals the sum of the squares
of the other two legs.


For a love note,
this lacks subtlety.

How would you know?

No one would ever
fall in love with you.

Love is ephemeral.

Mathematics is eternal.

Love is arbitrary.

Mathematics is consistent.

Love is elusive.

Mathematics is available
right here in this room.

When you're ready.

[class laughing]

How would you feel
if I wore a necktie

with a picture
of Genghis Kahn?

That'd be cool.

Mmhmm.

Hi, Mrs. Lumpkin.

Hi, Nick.

I need a shirt.


I've got just the thing.

Thanks, Mrs. Lumpkin.

we have 7x + 3y equals 24.

We know that x is
equal to y + 2.

So plugging in
our x is unknown.

We have 7y + 2,
+ 3y = 24.

Now multiplying that out;
7y + 14 + 3y = 24

Or 7y...

[bell ringing]

Now the common
variables there...

y is equal to
24 - 14 and 10.

Therefore y is equal
to 1, to solve that,

Therefore y is equal
to 1, to solve that,
plugging it right in.

plugging it right in.

Uh, 7x + 3 x y.

How about a little
one on one tonight?

Oh, is dinner included?

That's a deal.

I'll be there.

Rom.

Hey, Carly.

Hello, Dinah.

â™ª

Hi.
Hello.

Hi, Miss Groshardt.

Hey, Avery.
How's it going?

Not too good.

Oh really?
What's the matter?

Over population,
destruction of the rain forests,

nuclear weapons,
violence, player strikes,

acid rain, racism,
child abuse.

The national debt...

The national debt...
Come on back.
Dinner's almost ready.

Come on back.
Dinner's almost ready.

Killer bees,
tongue piercing.

Hi.

Welcome.

Can I help?

I don't need any help.

Smells good.

What is it?

It's French.

Oh, I hope the wine
goes with it.


I hope there's
enough for everyone.

Val.

Yeah.

Miss Groshardt's here.

Hi, Miss Groshardt.

Hi, Val.

What? Oh.
Where do I put it?

On the table.
Oh.

[ball bouncing]

Come on, coach...

â™ª

I'll be back.

Mind if I get
a drink of water?

Thanks.

Um, thanks for dinner, Carly.

I really liked those
French vegetables.

It's ratatouille.

Where'd you learn
to make that?

The Frugal Gourmet.

It's cheap, easy and it
makes good leftovers.

The recipe's enough to feed a
family of four for two meals.

See?

Here, take it.

You can have it
for lunch tomorrow.

No, I can't.
Why not?!

â™ª

Hey, I brought you
some ratatouille.

Avery, hot or cold?

One hot
and one cold.

Mom, did you wash my bra?

Uh, what does it look like?


Two straps, two cups.

Two straps, two cups.
Which one?

Which one?

The green one.

Why do you wear
a green bra?

Forget it.

Green means go.

What are we talking about?

Sex.

Does it ring a bell?
Ding-a-ling.

When you were her age,
you didn't wear any underwear.

That was during the sexual
revolution, which is over now.

We're supposed to try
and prevent teenage sex.

Why?

I don't know.
Because.

What's for dinner?

Fried chicken,
creamed gravy, mashed potatoes,

and who-made apple pie?

Mom, that's fantasy.
What's the reality?

I don't know.

Something good.

You can't wear that to school.

She's not.

She's just wearing
it to breakfast.

[pager beeping]

Excuse me.

Don't worry.

Why shouldn't I worry?

It makes you eat more,
then you gain weight.

â™ª

How's the team, Dinah?

Hmm, getting a lot
stronger on defense.

We've got some
good shooters too.

Rochelle's a
scoring machine.

Val's got a good
feel for the basket.

A chip off the old block.

No, good coaching.

I have a ghost
of a husband.

I only know he's
there because things

get moved from one
place to another.

I'm getting fat.

I don't know whether
I should go on a diet

or jump off a building.

Have an affair.

It's the most effective,

short-term pain reliever
there is.

That's not
very good advice, Albert.

Why not?

Because.

Who would have
an affair with me?

Girls' basketball used to
be a lot less important

to people than
boys' basketball.

I think that's changing.

I predict that someday
women's athletics

will be almost as
important as men's.

[stall door closing]


Um, excuse me.

Do you have any
toilet paper over there?

There's not any in here.

Um.


Sorry, there isn't
any here either.


Um, there's something--

I already know!

I don't see how you
possibly could know--

Stop beating around the bush.

I'm not beating
around the bush.

You're having
an affair with Rom.

No, I'm not.

I saw the note.
The note?

"Fuck me after basketball."

That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

There's nothing you can say.

Val wrote that note.

I'm not the type
to have affairs.

Val wrote that note?

Mhmm.

You know, she passed
it Jamie Hooper.


I think she's
in love with him.

She better not be!

Well, it happens to girls.

I know that!

Don't you think
I know that? I know that!

It makes me so mad!

Love makes girls
do stupid things

that they regret
for the rest of their lives.

I have a class.

It's a fairy tale;
Snow White, Cinderella.

It's a big crock!

There's no such thing
as happily ever after.

Six months happiness...

...to slow death.

It can't be that bad.

Haven't you ever
been in love?

No, not really.

Lucky you.

â™ª

Happy Valentine's Day.

Happy Valentine's Day.

Happy Valentine's Day.


â™ª


Should we have
a cigarette?

Yeah.

You don't smoke, do you?

I like a cigarette after sex.

Yeah, me too.

I'm sorry.

For what?

For accusing you wrongly.

And for going
through your purse.

And for not giving you
any toilet paper.

â™ª

Hello, Roosevelt High.

We're Automatic Assault Weapon

and we're gonna massacre
your Valentine's Day with music.


Be careful down there
in the mosh pit.

There are girls with
nice dresses on.

One, two, three, four.

â™ª

[hard rock music blares]

Hey!
You two!

This is a dance.

It's not
a simulation exercise.

You can't dance
to this music!

It must be why
they invented moshing.

I wish I felt
that young again!

Is that how, I just throw
my body around like that?!

I guess I'm not
too old for mash!


Need a man?

There's only one of me
but I'm on duty.

Good night, Dad.

Good night, Mom.

Good night, Miss Groshardt.



Do you think Val's in love?

Mmm.

She's too young
to be in love.

It won't last.

We lasted.

Hi, kids.

Hi, there.

Good morning.


That's it for today.

If you've got a hoop
at home, practice.

If you don't, go to
someone's house who does.

Hi.

Ooh, sorry.

I can't play ball.

You just need
a good coach.

I can't play any sports.
I'm not coordinated.

Oh, everybody can play ball.

Oh, everybody can play ball.
It comes natural.

It comes natural.

Here.

Um, that was...
That was...

Hold the ball like this.

Okay?

Keep your eye on the basket.

Forget about the ball.

Connect yourself to the
basket through the ball.

Move a little closer.

I made it!


That's my
very first basket.

Could we do this
again sometime?

â™ª

Sorry.

I'm fine.

I'm sorry.

Oh, I'm fine.

â™ª

Coffee is the one thing
we all have in common.

Even if the word coffee
means the same thing

in every language.

And a cup of coffee
means the same thing

in every culture.

Cloris was just telling
us about the meaning of coffee.

You know, it means the
same thing in every country.

What does it mean?

Communication.

Right.

Hey, Carly.

We're talking about coffee.

Hmm.

What's your opinion?

Is it a social lubricant
or a dangerous stimulant?

I don't have
an opinion about it.

It's just a drink.

Marcel Proust saw an entire web
of memory in a cup of coffee.

That was tea.

Coffee, Henry.

Tea, Cloris.

I know it was coffee.

You're wrong.
It was tea.

Let's change the subject.

Abel, what's happening
with the fruit flies?

Uh, they're multiplying.

[clicking of typewriter keys]

Any questions?

Yes, Philip.

What does this stuff have
to do with real life?

Algebra is a system of
logic which shows you

how to find the unknown
when you have some information.

In real life, you have to
do the same thing;

find the unknown with the
information you've been given.

[door squeaking open]

Do you see
six months of happiness?

More than that.

â™ª

Wow.

What do you mean "wow"?

You're beautiful.

I am?

Perfect.

Wow.

How did we get here?

I don't know.
I think it's a dream.

No, I never
dream about sex.

I've tried but
it never happens.

Hmm...

It's real.

What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

This.

What's so bad about this?

Fried chicken?

Is it a holiday?

This dinner
looks wonderful, honey.

Shall we say grace?

Grace?

Sure, let's say grace.

How does it go?

Thank you, God.

â™ª

It's distracting
and demoralizing

and it's not
fair to those students

who have their studies
foremost in their minds.

It's wanton, obscene.

Sexual isn't the
same as obscene.

I know what
obscene means.

Oh, even the Supreme Court
can't decide

what obscene means.

Constitutionally speaking,
it means

whatever turns you on.

Fuck the Constitution.

Is nothing sacred?

Uh, Rom, what about you?

What?

No, I don't think
I've noticed anything.

They're humping
in the hallways.

We've got to do something.

These are powerful libidos
we're trying to control.

We simply can't quash
their carnal energy.

You have to channel it
into art, into drama.

Well, they sexualize
everything anyway.

We might as well give them
something useful to sexualize,

then you'll get something
interesting out of them.

The question is should we
prohibit physical contact

of a sexual nature
between boys and girls

on school grounds?

Why not?

Why not?
We prohibit
between teachers.

We prohibit
between teachers.

If I can't feel up
Miss Paul on the premises,

why should my students
get to have all the fun?

I, uh, I think
that's settled.

â™ª

You bragged to your friends,
didn't you, Jamie?

Did you do it with me
because you wanted to

or just so you could get
points for it with the guys?

I asked you first.

Yeah, I wanted to.

I didn't think when we did it,

you were going to spread
it all over school.


Yeah, of course
you gotta go.

Bye!

Is something wrong?

No.

Oh.

You look like you might
have something on your mind.

Like what?

I don't know.

S-E-X?

Mhmm.

It's not all it's cracked up
to be, that's for sure.

It's not like in the movies.

It's like, it's kind of weird,
the...

What you gotta actually do,
you know?

I know.

They should give lessons.

I mean, it's not as
simple as it looks.

That's true.
It's true.

And then there's
diseases and pregnancy

And then there's
diseases and pregnancy
and all kinds of
shit to prevent.

and all kinds of
shit to prevent.

It's like life or death
every time you do it.

To tell you the truth,
Mom, it's a big mess.

I thought it was gonna
fix everything.

It may seem like now is
the time, you know, but...

Sex will be there
when you're older.

Even when you're my age.

Do you love him?

Yeah.

I like his music...
and his clothes.

And the way he smells.

That's love, isn't it?

[TV blares]

No, really, marriage is
a great institution.

Yeah, I think people
should get married...

Rom?

Hmm?

I'm having an affair.

Did you hear me?

With whom?

With, uh...

Dinah.

[Rom chuckles]

That's a good one.

You had me going
there for a minute.

I'm serious.

Come on, Carly, I've got
to finish these papers.

I'm not joking.

You're having an affair
with Dinah Groshardt?

How did it happen?

It just, uh...

...happened.

It just happened
that you...

You're with a Geometry teacher
who is a woman.

It's a little weird, I guess.

It's very weird.

It doesn't feel that way.

Jesus, Carly.

Sorry.

What are you gonna do?

I don't know.

I guess I was hoping you
could help me decide.

Just stop doing...

...whatever it is
you're doing with her.

I don't know if
I can do that.

You can't stop having
an affair with Dinah Groshardt?


It may be funny,
but it isn't a joke.

Hi.

Hi.

What happened?

He laughed.
He laughed.

What's so funny?

I don't know.

We are.

We are?
Mmhmm.

Mom!

Hi, Avery.

Hi.

Did daddy tell you
where I was?

He said you were
staying with a friend.


I'm, uh, staying with
Miss Groshardt.

Oh.

Why?

Well, that's what
I came to tell you.

I came home to
talk to you.

And then you're
leaving again?

A funny thing
happened to me.

I fell in love
with somebody.

And the person I fell in
love with is someone you know.

It's your geometry teacher -
Miss Groshardt.

Miss Groshardt?

It's pretty
shocking, isn't it?

Mom, how could you
fall in love with her?

She's a lady.

Well, that's what's
funny about it.

Ha! Ha!

Our mom's a lesbian.

I guess you could
put it that way.

What about dad?
Is he a lesbian too?

Moron!

A lesbian's a woman
who does it with women.

Does what?

Oh, boy.

Your Dad and I
love each other very much.

But it hasn't been
romantic between us

for a very long time.

Miss Groshardt and I--

Gross.

Do you still love us?

Of course I do.

I love you two
more than anything.

Bullshit!

Mom.

What's for dinner?


This is great.

It's cheap, easy,
makes great leftovers.

I said that, didn't I?

When you made that delicious
French vegetable dish.

Ratatouille?

Mhmm.

I, I love you.

I love you too.

What's up, bud?

Nothin'.

Marital troubles.

How did you know?

A guy starts looking depressed,
eating extra desserts,

he's gotta be
having female trouble.

You make it sound
like I have PMS.

Huh.

I guess men could have
some kind of biological,

hormonal kind of cycle.

Nah.

What's the problem?

Carly left me.

Anything I can do?

I don't think so, Rick.

She'll come back.

A woman like Carly
has got to have a man.

She didn't leave you for
another man, did she?

No.

Now?

Naked?

â™ª

Something fishy is going
on in this school.

I guess my question is -
what's going on

between Carly Lumpkin
and Dinah Groshardt?

Carly is staying with
Dinah because

she and Rom
are having problems.


I know amore
when I see it.

It's written all over
their faces.

There's Bill Borden.

â™ª

Well, hello again.
Hi.

Separate or together?

Separate.
Together.

Together.
Separate.

Separate.

You know, Dinah never
seemed too interested in men?

How would you know?

She never looked
at me that way.

There aren't enough
good men these days.

Sapphic love does not
correlate to the availability

of acceptable men,

however big a problem
that may be.

What's sapphic love?

Women.

Together.

Intercourse?

Technically no.

Right.

You're never too late
for sex education.

What are we going
to do about it?

The only cure
for being in love

is to fall in love
with someone else.

â™ª

It never would have
occurred to me

in a million years that
you would steal my wife.

I'm sorry.


I don't want
to hear that.

I don't want
to hear that.

I, I want you to explain
it to me because

I don't understand it.

I can't explain it, Rom.

I fell in love with her.

I never, uh...

I never knew you were like that.

Like what?

Queer.

I love Carly.

Whatever that makes me.

Your Mom is living
with Miss Groshardt?

She's just staying there.

She's having problems
with my Dad.

I'll tell you the problems
they're having is

she's aardvarking
with the hypotenuse.

Shut up, Jamie.

No way...
That's it?

I don't know.
What if it is?

My girlfriend's Mom is a dyke.

My parents would cut off
my allowance if they found out.

My fucking friends are
going to make fun of me.

And my fans...

Oh, it's all about you, huh?

No, I'm...

You're going to look
pretty stupid too.

Thanks, Jamie.
You're a big help.

I'm sorry, Val.

This whole thing is
just way too weird.

How do you think I feel?

How do you feel?

Weird.

Yeah.

Maybe nobody will find out.

Miss Lumpkin?

A bush bumper?

A muff diver?


That's intense.

That a girl!

Go inside...

Foul, ref!

Didn't you see that?

You're not qualified to
watch basketball on TV!


2-3! 2-3 zone!

[buzzer sounds]

Can I come over?

You want to come over?

Yeah.

I'll give you a key.


Angie, we've got to do
something about 41.

Next time down,
I want you to front her.

Make them lob it to her.

Val, if you see the lob,
slide over from the weak side

and double-team her.
Got it? Alright!

1, 2, 3, Cougars!

Set it up.
Set it up!

Woo-hoo!

What kind of mother could
do that to her children?


How can you show your face?

Come on, Avery.
Let's go.

But what about the game?

It's almost over.
We have to go.

Angel!



Excuse me.

You ought to have
a little more respect for her.

Alright, we can win
this one without Angel.

We've got the ball.

Sherry, Rochelle will inbound
to you and pick for you.

Look for Val or Cindy
across half court.

Once we get setup,
we'll run number 3.

Let's go.

1, 2, 3, Cougars!



Sir, excuse me.

Uh, you better not go in there.

Why?

They're not dressed.

â™ª


No boys allowed?

Hi, Rick.

Hi, coach.

Aah, they just lost
their concentration.

Yeah.

Hey there...
Chin up.

No, Rick.

No, Rick.
Don't try to
cheer me up, okay?

Don't try to
cheer me up, okay?

Okay.

I won't even shoot for a smile.

But you don't mind if I
help you relax a little?

â™ª

Relax.

Game's over.

There.

A lot of tension
hides out in the deltoids.

Mmm, traps too.

Good definition.

Nice lats.
Uh, Rick.

Relax. You've got a knot
right down here.

I'm just going to work on it.

Relax, Dinah.
Rick, what are you doing?

I'm just trying to
make you feel good.

If you loosened up a little,
I think you'd like it.

Like what, exactly?

The touch of a man.


I'm an expert.

What's going on?

I want you.

Oh, come on.

Come on.

I do.

I have feelings for you.

I don't,
I don't understand.

It's natural, Dinah.

A man like me.

A woman like you.

Let me finish the job.

The job?

What - someone put you
up to this?

Of course not!

I'm just trying to help.

Oh, God.

People were saying things.

We lost.

Avery could hear them.

What happened?
I don't know.

But I could feel it.

It felt like
everybody hated me.

It'll blow over.

In a few days,
people will get bored

and find something
else to talk about.

You really think so?

No.

What will happen?

I don't know.

But it's already started.

[phone ringing]

Eleanor B. Roosevelt
High School.

Yes, he's in.

It's Anthony Haynes.

Anthony, what can I do for you?

[nervous laugh]

That sounds like an
ugly rumor to me.

I, uh...

[phone ringing]

Eleanor B. Roosevelt
High School.

Yes, of course I have
concern for your daughter.

I have concern
for all of the students

at Roosevelt High School.

But I don't see what the...

[phone ringing]

Excuse me.

The principal will be
with you in a moment.


Chapter 16,
Congruent Triangles.

Come home.

We're not a family
without you.

Why is there only one way
to be a family?

I thought I knew you.

I'm changing.

You can't just start changing
after all these years!

I'm sorry.

My timing was bad.

Your whole concept was bad.

But my intentions
were good.

But my intentions
were good.
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

The road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

I'm not going to hell
for trying to fix a problem.

You just assume,
like everybody else,

that the problem
is me and Carly.

Well, maybe the
problem is you.

It's not me.

Yeah?
What makes you so sure?

For one thing...
I'm not the subject of

a special PTA meeting tonight.

We're going to be crucified.

It won't be like that.
Times have changed.

Not for us.

We've called this special
meeting of the PTA tonight

because some of you
have expressed concern

over the relationship between

Dinah Groshardt and
a member of our staff.

I need cookies.

[nervous laugh]

I certainly hope we can discuss
this reasonably as adults.

We have to take a stand
against this kind of thing.

Otherwise we might as well say
that homosexuals are safe,

normal authority figures
for our children.

Well, if they're normal
then what are we?

Dinah Groshardt
coached my daughter

to a college
basketball scholarship....

What else are they
teaching those girls?

That's what I'd like to know.

We got AIDS from men
sleeping together.

Women like them will
probably start some

new disease for us
to die from.

AIDS was not created
by homosexuals.

AIDS was not created
by homosexuals.
That's just the kind of
ignorant, bigoted opinion

That's just the kind of
ignorant, bigoted opinion

that makes people
like you dangerous.

I'm a Christian.

The Bible says that what
they do is an abomination

in the eyes of Lord.

That's scripture.

It's in the book of
Leviticus, chapter--

Actually, Leviticus,
chapter 18, verse 22

states that it's an abomination
for man to lie with man.

It doesn't say
anything about women.

Well, man means woman.

Chapter 15, verse 29
instructs us that on the

eighth day after the
onset of menstruation,

a woman shall take two turtles
to the temple for sacrifice.

Chapter 19 mentions
something about

no shaving, no tattoos--

Never wearing a garment made
from linen and wool blend.

Also not gossiping or
spreading stories about others.

And doing no unrighteousness
in judgement.

And not standing up
against your neighbor.

â™ª

In California, they had a
special prom for gay students.

The girls danced with girls and
the boys danced with boys.

Is that what you
want to happen here?

I don't like homosexuals
any more than the next man.

But God dammit, we've got
a winning basketball team!

Can't we wait and fire them
after the season?

I don't understand how
any self-respecting mother

could do this to her children.

A mother should put her
children's happiness

before her own.

I don't think anyone here
really knows how this

will affect her children.

Our children.

Can't they just go
back the way they were?

If they did, I'd like
to think that we could

forget the whole matter.

We could go back
to the way we were.

Act like it never happened.

And everybody would be happy.

Except me.

And me.

I've known Dinah Groshardt
a long time...

...and Carly Lumpkin too.

I've always thought
the world of them both.

Right now I don't know
what to think.

Fire them!

They're a disgrace
to the community!

That's right!

[unintelligible shouting]

You're the devil!

Sit down!

Everyone just sit down and
put your heads on your desks!

And, just, uh...

...get control of yourselves.

Let's go to bed.

There are 12 mistakes in this.

There are 12 mistakes in this.
See if you can find them.

See if you can find them.

The triangles you will be
studying are regular triangles.

[door creaking]

Um...

Hi.
Hi.

Smells good.

What's for dinner?

Chicken Dijon.

Chicken Dijon?

Frugal Gourmet.

Mind if I stay?

I can do it.

You don't need me anymore.

That's not what I said.

I saw a lawyer today.

We're getting divorced?

It's better that way.

I don't know if I can go
through this whole thing, Rom.

Yes, you can.
You have to.

Why?

Because I can see you again.

You're beautiful
and you're strong.

And it really makes me
love you again.

You can see all that?

Yeah.

Do you think Val and Avery
can see it too?

They've got eyes.

Can we talk?

What's there to talk about?

You.

And me.

Why don't you
just go away, Mom?

Go away!

Go away!

Go away!!
Go away!!!

I don't need you
as badly as they do.

What are you saying?

I'm saying you can leave.

I'm not holding you prisoner.

I didn't say you were.

I don't, I don't want
to feel like this.

You want me to leave?

â™ª

If I were a man, I know
what I'd do right now.

You'd ask me to marry you.

Good morning.

Good morning.

You think we'll live
happily ever after?

No.

How much longer?

A while.

We've still got time.

For what?

For the good stuff.


â™ª

Everybody got one?


This, I believe, is real life.

Let's try to find the unknown

using whatever information
we've been given.

Philip, what information
do we have?

That Miss Groshardt
and Mrs...

Miss Lumpkin
are getting married.

What else?

They got fired.

What is it that
we don't know?

Why they're getting married.

And why they got fired.

This is what
we have to deduce.

Now just think logically.

Why do people get married?

Because they love each other.

Makes sense to me.

Why did these two
people lose their jobs?

Because they set
a bad example for us.

Is love a bad example?

Ever?

Are you sure it
isn't too romantic?

What could be more
romantic than a wedding?

Thanks for sticking up
for us at the meeting.

When you're gay, you hear
a lot about Leviticus.

So we took The Bible
to bed with us

every night for a month.

Learned it forward
and backward.

Don't worry, if you stay
together long enough,

straight people will
forget that you're gay

and you'll be respectable.

You'll have to act gay
to remind them.

I've never made an
alternative wedding cake.

It's the same kind of cake.

Isn't it?

Yeah.

Nothing funny?

Nothing funny.

Nothing funny.

Think of it as theatre.

Avant-garde theatre.

Oh, I have the perfect hat.

We're no fools. Love rules!

Is love ever a bad example?

Read my comments.

Find the unknown.

Think for yourself.

Your Mom is really cool.

What, are you crazy?

They're like martyrs.

They sacrificed their jobs
and everything for love.

I've tried, you know,
but it's just not working.

What do you mean?

You and me, Val.
It's not working.

We fuck, we hangout,
we get high.

What's not
working about it?

Well...

Why don't you say
what you really mean?

How would you like it
if one of my parents

did something that
was totally sick.

It's not sick, okay?

Maybe it's fucked up,
but it's not sick!

Okay, but what do you
want me to do?

I mean, I can't go out
with a girl who's Mom

is getting married
to another woman!

Yeah, I see your point.

Hey, you're cool and all...

I really like you a lot.

Spare me, Jamie.

I was going to break up
with you anyway.


What do you think?

It's okay.

I prefer short skirts.

This is actually okay with you?

Oh, yeah.

Lesbian chic.

I know all about it now.

It's the new big thing.

â™ª

Love is believable.

Keep that as a smooth stone
for sometimes,

you may be the only one to love.

For sometimes,
you will be hated.

And all the love within reach
will have to be your own.

And would we could tap
from the spirits

who fly to be with us
at those moments

and lend us their wings.

Who land on the lamps
to give us comfort and courage

when we think
we have nothing to say.

When we have nothing to say,

perhaps it is
the time to listen.

To take dictation from
the saints of the past,

without judgement
can one say that, saints,

without judgement
can one love.

Seek out people
who make one feel good.

Love is free sometimes
and costly other times.

We may only
have each other.

When it comes, will it
come without warning

just as I'm picking my nose?

Will it knock on my door
in the morning

or tread in the bus
on my toes?

Will it come like
a change in the weather?

Will its greeting be
courteous or rough?

Will it alter
my life altogether?

Oh, tell me the truth
about love.

You have to know
what it felt like

to be me before...

...to understand what it
feels like to be me now.

Um...

I know what love is now.

It's me squared
plus Carly squared.

One human being
multiplied by itself

and added to another...

Equals the unknown.

The mystery.

It's a simple equation.

With only one answer.

Finally, a love has come
which would

cause me more shame
or rumor to conceal it

rather than lay it bare
for all.

Those are the first lines
of a 2,000-year-old poem.

And they express my whole
reason for being here today.

I would feel more shame
for hiding this love

and happiness from the world
than I could ever feel

for having it revealed.

Dinah, these are the
promises I make to you.

Of my own free will...

and before these people
as witnesses.

To always be on your--
To always be on your side.

To see you and love you...
To see you and love you...

...for who you are.

The light and the
dark inseparable.

...and the dark
inseparable.

To honor our differences.

And to stay with you.
And to stay with you.

As long as we breathe love...

...breathe love
into each other's hearts.

And life into...
...into each other's souls.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Dinah and Carly.

â™ª

You know, Jamie, I really...

I really like those
drawings that you did.

The hypotenuse
and...the other one.

Yeah, I guess I was a jerk.

I could give you a
recommendation for art school.

[music blares, crowd cheers]

Art school?

I'm- I'm sorry I didn't
speak up for you.

It's okay.

No...

No, it's not.
