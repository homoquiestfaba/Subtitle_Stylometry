My name is Dalton Russell.

Pay strict attention to what I say

because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

I've told you my name. That's the "who. "

The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

<i>But there's a vast difference</i>

<i>between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.</i>

The "what" is easy.

Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

That's also the "when. "

As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

it's exceedingly simple.

Because I can.

Which leaves us only with the "how. "

And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

lies the rub.

So, your mother tells me about

a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

Okay?
All right, okay.

He's crazy.

Now? On 51st? 50...
Yeah, that's where he is right now.

He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

What do I have to...

Yeah, we'll get lobster.
I'll put it on Mr. Ansinori's card.

Whatever. It's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

So what?

So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

Okay. This is funny.

I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

Fantastic. God damn it.

Excuse me.
Yeah.

Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

Yeah. Fine.

I don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

Sorry.
All right?

Yeah, you got it.
Thank you.

It was a security guy.

I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

Manhattan Trust.

...from Yale.
And this fucking rich prick I work for.

Thank you.

Excuse me. Sir?

Easy.

Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now!

Get down on the ground!

You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

One! Two! Three!

Back away from that counter!
Get your hand away from that button!

Put your hands on the floor! Now!

Oh... What the... What is this?

Todd, what are we gonna do?
What the fuck do you want me to do?

Keep your head down, fat man!
All right!

Get your fucking face on the floor!

You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

Get down.

Now, my friends and I are making

a very large withdrawal from this bank.

Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

Get your face on the floor.
All right, I'm down! I'm down!

Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.
20 Exchange Place.

I have got hostages.

You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

I not fucking kidding, man.

Central. Give me an 85.

Back up, sir! Back up! You!

Shit!
Back up! Back up!

Stay around the corner!

Central, give me an 85.

Perp with a gun. Possible hostages.

I repeat, possible hostages.
20 Exchange. Manhattan Trust.

Baby, I'm fighting for my life over here.

Keith, every time we have this conversation,
it's the same thing.

<i>- "Not now. "
Listen. Listen.</i>

Do you know what kind of thin ice
I'm on right now

with this check-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

<i>If this $140,000 doesn't show up
somewhere soon,</i>

<i>- things gonna get rough for me.
But you didn't take it.</i>

Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

trying to save his own ass
by fucking me over.

<i>- Eventually, it'll go away.
Then what?</i>

<i>- What about us?
Then, you know, I'll make First Grade</i>

and we'll have enough money
to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

<i>- or gets caught stealing a car?
He's the only family I've got.</i>

All right, I'm sorry, baby. You okay?

You still love me?
I'm sorry, too.

<i>- You still love me?
I love you, baby.</i>

All right. Big Willie and the twins for you
when I get home.

I got the handcuffs.
I got the gun.

Bye, Big Daddy.

Big Willie and the twins, huh?
That's correct.

Her lowlife brother, he's got three priors,
one for armed robbery.

17-year-old high-school dropout.
Doesn't have an honest bone in his body

and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

Can't you get rid of him?
I could, couldn't I?

No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

How's he feel about you?
Oh, he's thrilled.

To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem. "

Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

And what's wrong with that?
A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

You know what a diamond ring costs?

Come on, man. You've been married.
Please. I was 21.

Yeah, but you give her a ring?
Yeah, but she won't call me back.

You guys cops?
Oh, shit! He made us!

Christmas came early for you this year.

Bank robbery. Hostage situation.
20 Exchange Place.

What?
Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

What about the Madrugada thing?
The check-cashing thing?

I thought I was in the doghouse.
I just threw you a bone.

As far as I'm concerned, you still work here,

but if you don't think you're ready...
No, no, he's ready!

Oh, good. Good.

I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

This is it, baby. The show!
Yeah.

You got the call, man. God damn!

I guess I should be happy.
I might get to put off I.A.B.

Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

You look around. There are five armed men
pointing Uzis at you.

Just picture them in their underwear.

How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

Get back around the corner!
Get back!

I told you, move it! Move it!

Get those people back!
Get them the hell out of here!

All right, guys, as soon as we pull up,
I want everybody out.

The second floor window. Now.

Let them in there!
Let's go! Go now!

Sarge, what do you got?

I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

Who's on today? Who's your boss?

Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here.
Get him down here.

Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
On the air. Go.

Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

Can you come over to the other side?

Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

Back up! Go around,
around the corner.

Pull back. Pull it back.
We got to keep this secure.

Collins? What you got?
Hernandez.

I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

Let's go. Set them up. All right.

We've got it under control.

Step back, please!

Step back!
Get back! Thank you.

There's nothing going on.

You'll see it on the news tonight.

Step back, please.

Mr. Case?

Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

Oh, my.

Has anybody been hurt?
I don't think so, but there are hostages.

Oh, how awful.

Which branch is it?
Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

Which one?
20 Exchange Place.

Thank you, Katherine.

I'm sorry, Mr. Case.

Oh, dear God.

Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

The door was locked.
I tried to take a look inside

and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a. 357 in my face,

screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

See any other gunmen?
No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

You hear anything inside?
No, sir,

but with that. 357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

Okay.

Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

Yeah, once.
Really?

Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

What was that like?
Not one of my better days.

I bet. All right, well, look.

As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

at least until we make contact.

That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

Pop, what's going on? Yo.

All bank employees,
raise your hands!

Bank employees, this side!
Everyone else, over there!

Now, I need everybody
to take your cell phones and your keys

out of your pockets and handbags
and hold them in the air.

What's your name?
Peter.

Peter what?
Peter Hammond.

Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
I left it at home.

Peter, think very carefully
about how you answer the next question

because if you get it wrong,
your headstone will read,

"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

"who valiantly attempted
to prevent a brilliant bank robbery

"by trying to hide his cellular phone,

"but wound up getting shot
in the fucking head. "

Now, Peter Hammond,

where is your cell phone?

I'm telling you, I did. I left it at home.

Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please.

Hey. Don't worry about it.

Just let me talk to you!
Please, please, listen to me.

Let me explain.

Help! Help me.

Stop!

Stop!

Anyone else here smarter than me?

And you are?
Vikram Walia.

Vikram Walia. Thanks, Vikram.

Hey, mister.

Keep it.

Men here. Women here.

Move!

I need all of you
to strip down to your underwear.

Now.

Lady?

Believe me. This is the only situation
where I'd ask you to do this.

But take off your fucking clothes.
No.

You should be ashamed of yourself.

<i>What's with you mishegoyim?</i>

Go ahead. Make my day.

Take your fucking clothes off, lady.
No!

Stevie?

Let's go!

Now, I need all of you

to put on one of these suits
and these masks.

<i>I'm Shon Gables, with CBS 2 News,
outside Manhattan Trust Bank,</i>

<i>where we have just been told
by investigators,</i>

<i>the bank has been robbed.</i>

<i>The suspect or possible suspects are inside,</i>

<i>holed up with an unknown number
of hostages.</i>

Captain Darius?
Yeah.

I'm Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell.

Hey.

You may remember,
we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

during my training?

Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

Yeah, it was. It was.

So, what do we got?

I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

so I'm kind of busy.
I understand.

The way this works, Mr. Frazier,
is I deal with Mr. Grossman.

So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

No, it's not okay, Captain.

Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

I guess it'll have to be.

That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

Berk!
Yo!

Get these guys some vests!
Okay.

And check them into the command log.
Okay.

You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

Okay.
We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

All right.
Good to see you, Captain.

Shouldn't we be in there?

Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

he'll only dump on us.

If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

Your call, Keith.

Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

That's the one thing I learned
from Grossman,

is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

How do you mean?
Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

Told you, you could handle this.
Yeah.

I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

"Here's what we do. "

What happened at the hospital?

Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend.
Thank you.

I told you, I've got

a heart condition.

Get up.

Put down
your fucking weapons!

Don't move! Don't move!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

Don't move! Don't move! Come here!
I haven't got...

Come here, come here, come here!
I work in the bank!

On your knees! Down on your knees now!

They sent me out here!
Now!

He said stay away!
Cuff him.

If you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

Who said this? Who?
I don't know who!

The guy with the big fucking gun!

That's who!
All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

There's four of them in there!
Come on.

Christ!

Calm down!
Let's go!

Am I gonna be on TV?
Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

Was it a time when I thought
I might not see my family again? Yeah.

Yeah, I thought about it.
I mean, at first, I wasn't...

It was too much to think about at that point.

You know, with a gun in your face,
but after a while I...

You know, I thought about...

Yeah.

My wife, you know,
not seeing my wife again.

My kids. I got a 10-year-old son,
17-year-old daughter.

Yeah, I thought about it, man.
What do you think?

Those are my babies.

Beautiful.

Go ahead.

Miss White, I want you to rest assured

my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

And no business with your uncle?

In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
Is that right?

You are extremely well informed.
I have to be. Yes?

I have a Mr. Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

We'll need to end this here.

I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

and I'll be in touch.
Thank you, Miss White.

Right this way, sir.

Arthur Case? You sure?

<i>- That's what he said.
He said his name, just like that?</i>

It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

<i>- No, ma'am.
All right. Put him through.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>- This is Madeleine White.
Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.</i>

Oh, good morning, Mr. Case.

<i>- Have we met formally?
No, sir, I don't believe we have.</i>

Yet, you're always turning up

at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

Yes, we know some of the same people.

It seems.

I'll come right to the point.

I have a small problem
which requires someone

with very special skills
and complete discretion.

Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

<i>Go on.</i>

Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

I'll be downstairs.
Thank you.

They had a kind of genius plan

for throwing us out of whack

and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

They were... They were very

insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

All I know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

And they called you what?

They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

You know a lot about guns.
No.

I don't know anything about guns, except...
But you know they had an AK-47.

Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
Everybody?

Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

You ever rob a bank before?
Are you kidding?

Me rob a bank? No.

Never stole a dollar?
Never.

Never?
Not ever.

You know what?
That one time. That one time, that one time.

I stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

She was Polish.

<i>I used to go up to her and say,
"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah. "</i>

One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

I took it.

That was the only thing I ever took.

Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

they'd throw out two dead bodies.

He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

There's a video system in the bank.

We're working on getting a download

from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

What about the phones?

Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

but so far nothing.

911?
It's up on the screen.

Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

Beg your pardon?

Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

I'm not gonna call him
and ask what I can do for him.

Let's see what he does.

Your call.

Now, Mr. Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

Please. That would be nice.

Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

That's fine.

But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

that handle these kinds of things.

And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

Their people call me.

So, immediately, I know
that there's something in that box

that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

No problem with me.

You tell me I don't need to know
what's in that box and I don't need to know.

But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

and I find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

Have you finished?
Yes.

What's inside that box, young lady,

has belonged to me
since before you were born.

It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

Except you.

Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

Of course.
All right.

Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

I don't.

Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

Not them, not you, not the authorities.

And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier I'll be.

Is that specific enough for you?
No.

The contents of that box

are of great value to me.

So long as they remain my secret.

And if they're exposed?

I'll face some difficult questions.

So, it stays locked or it disappears.
Precisely.

Can you make that happen?
Yes.

I hope so.
I have to say, I can't help but be skeptical.

Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

Steve?

It's time for Steve-O.

I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

Guess what I found?

That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

Yeah.

Probably stolen.

Have them run it and check it for prints.

Everybody on?
Yep, I'm there.

Sure you got the right number?
Absolutely.

Okay. Nothing yet.

We got video.

Let's have it.

What happened to that camera
right there?

Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

It's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

It's weird, isn't it?
It's like nobody else sees it.

You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
It could be infrared.

What's that?
Infrared bulb.

See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

Right, right, right, right.

He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

So, for approximately two minutes,

we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

It was just a few minutes.

Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

And then I just remember one of them

telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

<i>- The video cameras?
I don't know.</i>

Anything else you want to share with us?

No, just...

You sure?
Yeah, I...

Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

You okay?
Thank you.

Okay.

It was pretty awful.
Was it bad?

I mean, they made us strip.

They made us take off our clothes.

I don't understand why they had to do that.

I really just thought...

I thought I was gonna be killed.

Well.

All right, my dear.
Okay.

I can go?
No.

No?
No, you got to stay.

You got to stay.
No, you can go.

No, stay. No, go.

Did you rob the bank?

You did.
Did you rob the bank?

No.
You sure?

There's movement at the front door.
Let's go.

Put down the fucking weapon!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

Don't move! Don't move!

He's got a device on him there.

I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

I said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

Hands are tied!
Hands are tied.

Jesus, pat him down.
All right.

I'm one of the hostages!
Careful.

Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

I can't see him from where I'm at.

I can see him. I got a clear shot.
Any weapons?

Who are you?
Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
What? No. I'm a Sikh!

Is that a bomb?
No.

Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
No.

Are you booby-trapped?
No, fuck, no.

Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

Jesus, give me a hand.
I don't know.

Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

Team, take him down.
Mike, now, get him.

What the fuck? Easy, easy.

Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

Come on, shut up. Relax.

What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

You can't fucking rip my turban.
Shut up, already.

What the fuck?
Come on, move it.

Get your fucking hands off me!

And the 11:00 and 12:00...

And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

Oh, Madge. What a day...
Your Honor.

Madeleine! How are you?

I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

Sure. Madge, are we through here?
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

This way, Miss White.

I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

Who are we saving this week?

Well, I'm doing a round of support

for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

It would be my pleasure.
Is there anything else I can do to...

What the fuck do you want?
A favor.

No shit. Which kind?
The last one I'll ever ask of you.

That's the kind I had in mind.

You know about this hostage situation.

On my way. What's it to do with you?

All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

So, I want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

to extend me every courtesy.

You're out of your fucking mind.

If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

It's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

I may have to give out a few.

Then that's exactly what you'll do.

You're a magnificent cunt.

Thank you.

<i>It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.</i>

<i>It's unclear how many hostages are inside</i>

<i>and how many robbers
police are dealing with.</i>

<i>Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,</i>

<i>but has turned into this hostage situation.</i>

<i>Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard</i>

<i>and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.</i>

<i>Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest</i>

<i>and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.</i>

<i>That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.</i>

<i>Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.</i>

"Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

It's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

Okay, we'll find your turban.

Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

I didn't hear that.
I heard what I heard.

I'll give you all the information you want.

I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

We'll get you your turban.
We'll find it for you.

No, no, no. Not "get me. "
I want my turban now.

You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

It's a dangerous situation.

You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

You can write a formal complaint.

But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

I could apologize on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

We're gonna try and find out...
What do you want to know?

How many were there?
I think there were about four.

How many hostages?
I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

I get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

I go to the airport.

I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

I bet you can get a cab, though.

I guess that's one of the perks.

Put the ice on your face.

<i>"Two buses with full gas tanks.
One jumbo jet with full gas tank</i>

<i>"and pilots at JFK,
parked at the end of runway. "</i>

<i>They give us until 9:00 pm to do this,</i>

<i>then they kill one hostage every hour
in front of TV cameras.</i>

"Bank is secured with Semtex.
We will demonstrate if necessary. "

Whatever you do, don't give them a jet.
There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

For now, we wait.

Let's let them wonder
what we're doing, okay?

Excuse me, Detectives. This is Arthur Case.

He's the...
I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

Of the bank. You wanna talk to him?
Absolutely.

Mr. Case, how are you?
I'm Detective Frazier.

Anything in particular
you think we should know?

No. I just wondered
if I might be of some assistance.

Have they made any demands?
They want a jet.

Oh, I see.

Would you like me to arrange one for you?

I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

That's quite all right, Mr. Case.

Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

I'll be very quiet right down...
Sergeant Collins!

Mr. Case, we'll try and keep you posted
as best we can,

but you're gonna have to excuse us
for now, okay?

Right this way, sir.
Thank you very much.

Absolutely.
This way, sir.

Thank you very much.
And thank you all so much.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

This way, sir.

"Fifty hungry people need food now. "

All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

Is she for real?
Are you for real?

Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

They can move around
and I don't have 50 transmitters.

What's this?
It's a digital recorder.

You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

James Bond shit.
Well, you can get them on Amazon.

You gonna ask for a hostage?
He already gave us one, didn't he?

I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

No, he knows what he's doing.

He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

I don't want to get caught bluffing this guy.

Fuck this shit. Look, they want to shoot me
for taking off my mask, they can go ahead.

Do you wanna get us all killed?

You wanna relax?
What the hell is the difference?

They're out there robbing the bank!

Can't you see they fucked him up?
Shut up.

<i>You think they dressed us like this for fun,
puñeta?</i>

I have no idea
Please shut up.

...why they made us put on all of this crap.

Probably so when the cops break in
and try to rescue us

we all get fucking shot.
Oh, my God!

It's a great plan, but, no, thanks.

I told you to shut up! Leave him!

No! Don't do this to me! Please, don't.

I'll do as you say! No! Help! Help!

Please, don't! Don't!

One guy did most of the talking.

He told everyone else what to do.

So they were talking amongst themselves?
We couldn't hear them.

They had us in these rooms.

The doors were locked all the time.

We didn't know what they were doing.

Did you hear anything they said?
I have problems with my hearing.

I see.
I wear hearing aids.

Where are they?
They're in my ears.

Let's see.
Let me see them.

Yeah, let's take a look at them.
Yeah, it's a hearing aid.

That's your other one, there?

What's the red part, there?
What does that do?

They're different colors.
You need two different...

And to distinguish right from left, also.

Distinguish right from left?
Yeah.

Right from wrong.

I don't understand.

Steve?
I'm sorry?

I didn't say anything.
Oh.

Steve. Is that your name? Steve?

Stevie? Steve-O?

How much are they gonna pay you?
I'm sorry?

You heard me.
No, I didn't.

How much are they going to pay you?
Who's gonna pay me?

Were you involved in this robbery?
Absolutely not.

Were you involved in this situation?

What situation?
Don't lie. Don't lie.

If he gives us a tip, I'm keeping it.

Put that gun down!
Check that weapon!

All right, everybody, relax.
Calm down. Calm down.

Calm the fuck down!

How you doing?

I'm Detective Keith Frazier,
Hostage Negotiation Team.

How's it going?

Okay. I hope the pizzas are okay.
They might be a little cold.

Listen, you pick up the phone
anytime you want.

It's a direct line to me.

I would love to talk to you.

Nice talking to you.

Shit. Fucking Russians.

Call Operations. See if they can get
a Russian translator over here ASAP.

And get some fucking body bags.

I hope you know what you're doing.

Because if my guys got to shoot it out
with those fucking savages...

Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

Check with either one of the hostages.

Find out if they heard any Russian
or Russian accents when they were in there.

We'll be all right.

No!

Down on the floor!

Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go.

Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

Get in there! Sit down! Put your masks on!

Come on, let's go. Come on, boobs.

"Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to?
Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

Why?
Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

"Fat ass"? Are you kidding me?

If you don't shut the fuck up,
I'm gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

Put your masks on!

Put your hands on the ground!

Okay, okay.

On the floor. Hands are on the floor.

Masks on!

Put your hands on the ground!

Come on, boobs, let's go.

Oh, shit. Sit down! Sit down!

She was on line in front of me.

He was the teller on my line.

This guy was to my right
and his kid was in front of him.

He was playing with a video game.

I remember her.

Why do you remember her?
Great tits.

You remember seeing any of them after?
Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

How are you sure you saw her again?
I could see under the suit.

Can't hide quality like that.

This guy, he almost got us all killed.

How?

They put eight or nine of us
in an office for a while.

This guy took off his mask
and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

"I don't have to wear this damn mask,"
you know?

So, they come in, pull him out of the room
and smack him around a little.

You see him again after that?
No.

Was he okay?
Seemed fine.

You...

You recognize anyone else from that room?
I can't be sure about the others.

No one?

Why don't you keep looking?
You know, I was terrified.

What about before it began?

You didn't look around
while you were waiting in line?

I was talking to my girlfriend on the phone.

You wanna take another picture?

I could bend over and pick up a pencil.

Whatever.

This guy.

Asshole.

What the fuck? This ain't Russian.

No? What the hell is it?

It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

Bulgarian, maybe.

It's Central European. Sort of.

That's it?
I mean, you're the language expert.

What? No.

What do you think?
Well, okay.

Well, this is New York City.

Somebody on the street
must know what it is.

Probably the hot-dog man.

Berk, play that over the speaker for me.
Excuse me.

Excuse me!

Does anybody know
what language they're speaking? Anybody?

Yo, my man.

Hey, Phil, let that guy through. Come on.

You know what language they're speaking?
Yeah, they're speaking Albanian.

Albanian?
Albanian. From Albania.

What am I doing here?

Yo, am I getting arrested for something?

No, you're not getting arrested.
Come on. Come on.

Whoa.

Okay. What are they saying?
I have no idea what they're saying.

You got no idea?
I thought you said you spoke Albanian.

No. I never said I speak Albanian.

You said you spoke Albanian.

I never said I speak Albanian.

Well, how do you know it's Albanian?

My ex-wife and her parents are Albanian.

Her parents couldn't speak English for shit.

I have no idea what they're saying,

but I'll tell you right now
that the language is 100% Albanian.

100%?
100%.

Call the Albanian Consulate.
See if they can get somebody over here

to translate this for us. Make it happen fast.

Okay, you hang out
in the back for me, okay?

Oh, man, not again.

Van was stolen two days ago, but it's clean.
No prints.

Nothing?
Nothing.

Albanian?

My man, like I told you, 100% Albanian.

Undeniable.

Hey.
Thanks.

<i>Yo, yo, yo.
There go that motherfucker right there.</i>

<i>Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna
get away with that shit, didn't you?</i>

How does this game work?

You get points for doing dirt,
like jacking a car or selling crack.

And you lose points
if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

<i>Come on, baby.</i>

<i>Take that! Take this! What? What? What?</i>

<i>Talk shit now! I don't hear you!</i>

<i>Eat this! Eat that! Eat this! Eat that!</i>

<i>You're gone, baby! You're dead! Bye-bye!</i>

Jesus!

What's the point of this?

Like my man 50 says,
"Get rich or die tryin'."

Yo, you'd get mad points
for knocking over the bank.

You think that's cool?
Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

Finish your slice.
I'll take you back to your father.

I got to talk to him about this game.

Is it good?
No doubt.

It's gonna be okay.

Cool.

You'll be home soon.

That's whassup.

Sir?
Yeah.

No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
What do you mean?

I couldn't tell what the guy
was talking about. I think he wanted money.

And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

Okay.

Call her.
Are you crazy?

I hate that bitch. Come on.
You said she speaks Albanian, right?

Yeah, she was born there.
Call her.

I'm gonna regret this.

Who's Detective Frazier?
Right here.

I have Ilina Maria over here.
Miritia.

Oh, how you doing?
Hello.

How you doing?

What's this?
Parking tickets. You can fix them?

Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

Can you listen to this
and tell us what they're saying?

You can't smoke in here.

Shit. Go ahead.
