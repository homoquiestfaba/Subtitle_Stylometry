Oh my God! Jeff Woods?

My man.
Yo-- straight up? No homo.

But I got love for the man.

This guy was the architect
of comedy as we know it today.

Brilliant mind, comedic genius,

quick-witted,
improvisational skills,

crowd work!
He was the master of ceremonies.

He made other comics
sit down and take note.

He was a comic's comic!

Jeff Woods.

I mean beyond question,

if you're talking about
somebody who is the best,

then I think
that the name says it all.

I mean, you encompass
comedy and performance

and brilliance, and you take it
and you shake it up

and what you create is the expression
that he was able to give to the world.

He's just so--

he's so funny!

You-- I wanna...

I actually wanna
break him off somethin'!

'Cause he's so funny.
I mean, I ain't it.

He's just that funny!
He's that funny!

I don't know what to give him!
But some--

you know,
some chubby pussy!

Hey, man, listen,

Jeff Woods was GOAT.

That's what I used
to call him: GOAT!

Greatest Of All Time.

If you don't know
what that mean. Yeah.

What a shame what happened
to Jeff Woods.

It's a damn shame.

Naw. See, what had
happened was--

From the first time I saw Jeff Woods

I knew he was going to be a star.

Born on the Southside of Chicago

in the early '70s,

Jeff displayed natural comic
talent at a very young age.

He was the funniest
child in the world.

He would-- he could stand-up
in front of anybody

and make jokes! Even when the family
members would come over,

or the members of the church.
He used to talk about me and my husband.

That got a little embarrassing.
That wasn't funny though.

No no. Sometimes he used
to tell too much!

I didn't like that.
Now we didn't spare the rod, baby!

We could beat his li'l ass.
Oh-- ohhh!

We didn't have
no problem with that!

Can we say that
on camera? Ass?

No no no. I don't know.
But anyway--

oooh, it just came to me.
Excuse me.

But anyway, um, no,
he was-- he was somethin.

I always knew he was
gonna be something.

We are so proud of him.
Yep.

Yes! Put that down, please.
Down, put it down.

Yeah, we're proud of him. I'm-- I'm--
Put it down.

I'm proud of him.
Yes!

Yeah, shit, I knew Jeff. Yep.

Sho' did. His ass--
he used to crack me up.

That motherfucker,
he knew all the records!

He knew Bill Cosby, Eddie Pryor!

I mean--
that's not Eddie Pryor.

That's Eddie Murphy!
Eddie Murphy.

Eddie Murphy,
Richard Pryor,

Bill Cosby.
I mean he would have us crackin' up!

We'd be on the floor, and I be like
"Damn, nigga, you are funny!"

I knew he was gonna be a comedian
'cause that motherfucker had me rollin'.

And it's hard to make me laugh.

Oh yes, I remember Jeffrey Woods.

He sat in the third row,
fourth seat from the back,

but he spent more time standing
in the corner and missing recess.

Jeffrey was an intelligent child,

but he was always trying
to be the class clown.

I think it was because he wanted
the other children to like him.

Once he set fire to my wig

by shining sunlight
through a magnifying glass.

Little bastard!

See this hole in the chalkboard?

Jeffrey Woods!

After growing into young adulthood,

Jeff started to make his rounds

at the open mikes
in the local comedy clubs.

Jeff quickly became the hottest name

on the Chicago comedy scene.

I just smoke these--

'cause it helps me cut down
on my coughing, see?

But anyway,
Jeff Woods?

Yeah, I know that motherfucker.
Known him a long time.

Taught him every
goddamn thing he know!

Every-fucking-thing. You know
that little bullshit saying he got?

The one that-- "Naw.
See, what had happened was"--

the motherfucker stole
that shit from me.

See, I used to say
"What had happened was this."

I'ma sue the motherfucker
if I see him!

And I'ma shoot him!
You know what I'ma do?

I'ma shoot him
and then I'ma sue his ass!

Like millions of dreamers
from around the world,

Jeff came to the place
of palm trees,

sunny days and fame.

But the cutthroat stages of Los Angeles

weren't showing him any love.

When Jeffrey Woods first started out,

they used to flash the "time's up" light

before a nigga could even
finish saying his name.

After a while, his name started buzzing.

"Did you hear about
this dude Jeff Woods?!"

"Did you hear
about this dude Jeff Woods?"

And I'm like,
"Man, who da fuck is Jeff Woods?"

So then I caught his act one night.

Yeah, and the nigga was funny.

I mean he was all right.

Couldn't fuck with my act though.

Jeff started making memorable cameos

in low budget
straight-to-video comedies.

Naw. See, what had
happened was...

See, I'm telling you, it was that

"Naw. See, what happened was"
line that blew him up.

See, most comics don't know
how to market themselves.

He had a franchise line.
Think about it.

It wasn't that funny.

I mean, but if you hear
something enough times,

it'll grow on you.
Now I got a franchise line

and it's actually funny.

"Damn. I'm sho' glad
that wasn't me!"

Maybe y'all didn't
get it the first time.

Damn. I'm sho glad
that wasn't me!"

Wasn't me!

Wasn't me-- no?

In what seemed like a short time,

Jeff became one of the hottest comics

in town.

Having finally tasted success,

Jeff began to live the Hollywood life.

Hollywood life.

Don't stick me, man.
No, you got it.

Jeff Woods is my man, man.

Came out here from Chi-town,
did his thing.

I remember he used to be broke.
We used to get coffee together.

You know what I'm saying? We didn't
have two little pennies to do nothin'.

And then all of a sudden he blew up,
made his little money,

got to hanging around
with the wrong folks!

Now personally, me,
I told him, man.

You know what I'm saying?
If you get yo money,

just still act like you broke!

He went out there,
hanging with the wrong folks.

White folks, that's who
he was hanging with.

Hanging with them white folks,
got the wrong drugs,

and now he blew his little mind.
I told him that, man!

You see, wh-- when--
when you're black,

you can't do all them
type of drugs, man!

You gotta be like me. Chill out,

smoke your little weed,
have a little drink, that's it!

You get to doing them drugs--
white folks'll do anything.

You're gonna wake up
buck naked in the bathtub

with your kidney missing,
your asshole wet and your mouth hurt.

Ohhh Jeff...

Jeff and I would do all kinds of things.

Drugs, alcohol,

SEX-.

Whips, chains,

asphyxiation.

You name it.
We was nasty.

But that was
before I found the Lord.

I am now a Christian-

born again, saved, sanctified
and filled with the Holy Ghost.

Hallelujah!

Talking about when I was
on the road with him one time,

I got to see him-- ughh!
I walk in the room, the door open.

I see him there-- he didn't know--
I'ma tell this story.

He was in there,
had his underwear down,

sticking 8-balls
up his ass. Yeah!

Freak! Talking about
it hit ya harder that way!

I don't know what it did for him,
but it scared the shit outta me.

As fast as Jeff's star was rising,

it was falling.
Then it happened.

After spending months
in the hospital and rehab,

Jeff has all but totally faded
from the spotlight.

He was very reluctant to let us
film a documentary about him,

but after months
of begging and stalking,

I finally convinced him
that his story

would be an inspiration
to those coming behind him.

Yesterday he finally called

and agreed to do the documentary.

But he made me promise
that if he decides to do stand-up again,

I can't ever film his act.

Jeff is being released today.

We're on our way to pick him up now.

Yeah, I work for the post office,

but let me tell you what make me mad.
What make me mad

is people always assume
just 'cause you work at the post office

that you're gonna lose
your mind and go off sometime!

I never go off! I never tell
people that I'ma kill 'em!

Or run 'em down there!
Guess what? Your mail ain't coming!

No mail for your ass! Ha ha!

Jeff was one
of the first guys I met

when I got to LA.

We met at like at an open mike
or something, you know.

We clicked right away.

We clicked.
It was crazy.

Before I knew it, we were
tighter than Preach and Cochise.

We played the circuit,
all that stuff, man.

But the thing is
he was actually funny.

I wasn't.

And then she said, "it's wet"?

Hubie, take your arms
off the table!

See, Jeff and I were
in the comedy trenches together.

And we always said

when we blew up,
we would keep it real--

with comedy and each other.

My Hubert loves comedy!

He's been dreaming about being
a comedian since I've known him.

And I told him, I want you
to pursue your dreams,

but you better take care
of your responsibilities.

And he does!
My Hubert always seems to know

who and what is important to him.

Now Jeff on the other hand?

Huh!

Don't even ask me about him.

<i>Mmmm.</i>

After all that's happened, Hubert,

why are you still Jeff's friend?

I learned something about
friendship a long time ago:

Dealing with people is hard.

I mean they-- they fuck up.

They make mistakes.

They do some
of the dumbest shit imaginable.

But you accept your friends
for who they are--

good or bad!

That's what real friendship
is all about.

And that brother Jeff?
He my friend.

Yeah.

My man.

I don't know what I would have
done without Hubert.

He was the only one--

the only one to hold me
down the entire time.

I don't even think they make
friends like Hubert anymore.

Get in there, yes sir.
Get in there, boss.

How do you feel, Jeff?

It feels good to just have
a clear head, you know?

Yo, you know he from Chicago
like me-- Southside!

Go way back.
And let me tell ya something else--

I understand his situation.

I'm an addict myself-- Michael Coylar.
I don't mind admitting it.

Crackhead. Once you're an addict,
you're always an addict.

So I know what it's like
to get into recovery,

how to bring yourself back.
Oh man!

I was out there so bad.
I remember I was so high one night,

I broke into my own damn house!
I ain't lying.

I was halfway out the door with the TV
before I realized it was my damn place!

So I know what the brother is
going through, so I'm proud of him

'cause he's coming back, man.

He went into his li'l rehab thing,

now he's coming on back
and getting hisself together.

They gonna be glad to see you!

Told y'all somebody is going
to be staying with us!

Uncle Jeff.
Uncle Jeff!

When you're making money the way I was--
so much money, so fast?!

You really think it's gonna
keep coming like that forever.

Now I'm crashing with Hubert
till I get back on my feet.

I admire Hubert, man.

I really really do.

Family--

that's what it's all about.

Man, if I could have my comedy tight,

a wife,

kids at home...

I'd be the happiest dude
on the planet.

Donna, this is the best food
I had in a long time.

For real, for real.

Thank you.

Now Jeff was supposed to be
my Hubert's best friend.

But after he blew up, he wasn't even
returning Hubert's phone calls.

I guess he was out,
too busy getting high.

Now he's all saved,
sanctified and cleaned up.

Ha! Yeah right.

I told Hubert-- and I mean it--

Jeff's got three days
in my house-- three days!

I don't do crackheads
around my kids.

Who are you writing to?

Iris.

Oh, Iris?

Now that was Jeff's girlfriend.

Cute little schoolteacher
from Chicago.

She came out to LA with Jeff.

And while Jeff was trying
to get noticed,

Iris took care of all the bills.

I mean she was really
down for that brother.

I mean really!
She was a soldier.

I started writing to Iris

my first week in rehab.

I write her or mail her
a letter every day.

She never responds.

I understand.

Ladies, there some drawbacks to messin'
with these dudes on that Viagra.

I mean his penis is incredible,
but his hip ain't no damn good.

You understand me?

Hip be clicking.
Click click! Click click!

Hip be clicking!

And I tell you what, you don't wanna
mess around and have no baby

with no old penis like that.
You mess around and have a baby,

baby come out
seven or eight years old!

Step out like, "Ah!

Where my cigarettes at?

God damn.
And where are my shoes?

Where my clothes at?"

I'm killing this bitch, ain't I?

I'm terrified.

It's been so long

I can't even remember

the last time I actually
did any stand-up.

You know what the worst part
for me might be?

The expectations.

'Cause I know whatever
I say might not be enough, you know?

Once I get in the club,
it's like, everybody's like,

"Oh, girl, he outta rehab, girl.
Let's see how funny he is now, girl.

He ain't funny.
They were smokin'."

You know, I-- you never know.
They wanna see you fall on your face.

That's kinda scary.

As a comic, you know,

you like to think you can just walk
into a comedy club

at anytime and be
the motherfucking man!

Now I used to feel like that.

Now I don't know.

That's scary.

Hey, Joyce.

He got a lot of nerve
showing his face around here.

That boy was nobody
when Grant found him.

Grant put his heart and soul
into guiding that boy.

Grant was gonna take him
to the top!

And then what'd he do?

Like a nigga, he fucked it up!
Piece of shit!

Now? Okay.

Right to the camera-- okay.

Um, well.

You know, every--
every manager

dreams of having

that special client.

You know--
the one with a spark,

with that touch of magic!

And, uh, that's what
I found in Jeff.

Man, there's a whole lot
of stuff that I wanna tell Grant.

I wanna tell him
I'm ready to get back-

the right way.

I wanna tell him
I'll do whatever it takes!

I wanna tell him
I know I can't do it without him.

And most importantly,

I wanna tell him I'm sorry.

Grant, don't believe
this motherfucker!

That nigga's crazy, Grant!

Oh no.

Oh no, he gonna hit him.

Oh my God!

Oh.

Oh! God damn it!

I think it's particularly
hard in this town

when you've had
a "fall from grace."

Especially-
and I'm gonna say it--

for a black actor,

it's very difficult to get back.

You know, the pressure
from the media,

the fans, it's-.

Hmm, I don't know.
It's very difficult.

It's three times as hard
as anybody else.

Four.

No.

It's six times as hard.

So I flushed
that shit down the toilet

just as the po-pos were
comin' through the door.

Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

Proud to say it--

I ain't smoke none of it!

We love you, Marcus!

I love y'all too.

Thank you for sharing
that with us, Marcus.

Thanks for your strength
and resilience.

Congratulations.

Cornelius!

Would you like to share with us?

Give us your latest testimony?

Okay.
How about you, Jeff?

Would you like to share?

Oh, man.

I'm not gonna lie.

I think about getting high every day.

You know what I mean, Machete?

They say once you're an addict,

you're always an addict.

Which is not the most
encouraging thing you ever heard!

But to sum up my week...

I'm lucky to be alive.

I used to do it all--
coke, "X," heroin.

But O.D.ing
and damn near dying?

That's a wake-up call
like a mother.

It forces you to put things
in perspective.

Best thing for me now
is just to stay active.

What's the saying?
"The idle mind

is the devil's playground"?

I believe that.
I really believe that.

It's best for me to just keep
nurturing my mind and my spirit.

That's why I got back into church.

Man, I don't even speak Spanish.

Not a word-- maybe uno.
That's it.

But one night I was walking by

and the spirit

was just calling me.

I been going ever since.

Most of the time I don't understand
a word that preacher saying-

"Okay, all right."

But I feel what he's saying.

That's what's important.

It's like in a weird way
he's speaking in tongues

just to me, like only I can hear it.

I don't know.

I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message after the tone.

Hey, Iris.
This is Jeff.

Um,

I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop by.

Uh, if you got my letters,

you know I'm outta rehab.

Um, I hope you got the letters, um.

It feels weird
calling you Iris, babe.

Look, this is what I--
I just wanna say--

When I first started getting high...

she asked me if I needed to get help.

I told her I had it under control,

just now and then.

Classic okie-doke.

She hung around for a long time.

A lot longer than she should have.

All right, y'all.
Y'all ready for your next comic?

Make some noise?

All right,
y'all know how we do it.

We like to give some love
to the young comics in the game.

So let's show some love to my man as
he come to the stage from Gary, Indiana.

Let him hear it, y'all. F.U.

F-you! F-you!

F-you! F-you!

F-you, nigga!

Nigga trying to take my shine.
What's up, motherfuckers?!

Naw, gimme some more energy!
I mean, what's up, motherfuckers?

Me and Jeff, we studied
all of the old school comics.

I'm talking Carlin,
Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor.

See, we wanted to have
some substance to our comedy.

We didn't just wanna be willly-nillying
our way through the comedy world.

So these young bucks nowadays,
they kill me

'cause they-- they don't
do nothing but cuss.

Every time I turn around
there's a shit joke,

a dick joke,
a fuck-you motherfucker,

shit, pussy, dick.
You can't-- you can't do that!

That ain't comedy.

Shit, motherfuckers know, nigga,

when when I get on the goddamn stage,
I'm bringing that fucking realness.

You know what I'm sayin'? Niggas be
like "That nigga coming to the stage,

he bringin' that fucking real hard,
nothing-but-God-damn- that funny shit!"

That's all I do!
I'm that nigga!

You know what I'm sayin'?
Motherfuckers look to me

for the real shit.
They can't get it nowhere else.

I'm bringin' it.
I'm packaging this shit up.

It's what the fuck it is.
You know what I'm sayin.

Niggas don't understand, son.
They don't fuckin' understand!

I'm F.U., bitch. I'm F.U.

Shit.

Oh that's fucked up.
That's the light?

Y'all gonna give a nigga the light?
I'm up in here killin' this bitch.

Motherfucker started doing good,
y'all wanna get a nigga offstage.

That's fucked up though.
You know what?

Fuck y'all niggas! Y'all should
be glad I was on this bitch

in the first goddamn place, but before
I walk off this motherfucker tonight,

I wanna know one thing!
What bitch in here

is fuckin'
this nigga here? Huh?

F-you, nigga.

F-you.

Oh yeah, and for anybody
that's interested,

F.U. is also available
for birthday parties and church gigs.

Enough of that!
It's time to really kick this show

into third, fourth, fifth gear.

Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure

to give y'all
a special treat tonight.

Coming to the stage-
oh my God!

We 'bout to hit y'all
with somebody

y'all already know,
somebody y'all already love.

We about to go celebrity
on you. That's right.

A man who cut his teeth
right here on this stage.

He been away for a minute,
he coming back.

Ladies and gentlemen,
start clapping right now.

Start clapping right now!

Show some love for my man,

Mr. Jeff Woods!

What up, LA?

What's going on?

You know what?
It wasn't good, man. That shit was--

it wasn't-- it wasn't
about nothing, man.

I mean he saying the same old jokes
he said two years ago.

I mean it's good to see him
back out there, man,

but, you know, talk about
something new, you know?

This dude up on stage
that I came to see--

I thought he was funny
'cause I saw his old shit.

But he didn't do the Old shit I liked!

What happened to the "Naw.
See, what had happened was"?

He picked some old old shit
like some Moms Mabley old shit.

I mean I like her,
but this is fucked up!

It's such a shame! You know that's what
happens when you mess with those drugs.

I'm telling you, dog, Jeff is one of the
funniest comedians out there right now!

Don't get me wrong.
He messed up, you know what I'm saying.

This how funny--
this how funny he was to me--

C'mon, dog.
It wasn't that bad.

Okay, it was bad.
It was, it was.

But it's like-- it's like
not working out in a while.

You know?
You're just a little outta shape.

For me to watch him

doing whatever that is
on stage right now--

it-- it-- it just makes me weak.

It makes me wanna cry,
you know?

It's like watching your dad
get his ass kicked.

You know what I mean?
Like, this is the guy you look up to,

all of a sudden now
the neighbor is whooping his ass.

And you're like,
"Daddy, what-- what happened?"

Maybe it's time

that you write some new material.

Hubert's right, man.
I gotta write some new material.

I'm coming back,
I gotta come back different.

I'm done with that old shit. I don't
even wanna hear that shit no more.

Naw! See, what had
happened was--

Guess who I just saw, bro.
Guess who I just saw!

Like I said, I don't wanna hear
that shit, all right?

I'ma get me a pad and a pen
like back in the day,

write some new shit.
It's gonna be funny.

Okay. Love you too. Bye.

Well. Ahem.

Somebody has
an audition tomorrow

for a cameo role

on that new hit show
"Baby Mama's House."

What?

Why the long face?
This is a cameo on a hit show!

I'd say that's a pretty good start.

I don't know, Grant.

I mean I knew we were
starting all over again

and I knew it was gonna
be harder than before,

but-- damn!

You know,

when this guy first
came into my office,

he had an energy
that could not be denied!

He had drive.

He had purpose.

He knew what he wanted!

Hey!

Has anybody ever told you you look like
Jeff Woods, you handsome devil you?

Now come on.
Let's hear it.

Come on, say it!

Say it!

Don't make me beg.
Naw. See, what had happened was--

Oh, I knew it. I knew it!

Joyce, he said it.
You owe me lunch.

Okay, now look look, Jeffrey!

Listen up.
I want you to go there tomorrow

and I want you to nail it!

-Okay? Okay!
-<i>I</i> got you.

I'ma kill this audition, dog.

See there.
This nigga sucks.

Look at them cheap
bargain-basement shoes he got on.

Trash, dog.

And word on the street,
he's still smoking.

I don't think there
is any other job

where you experience as much
hate as stand-up comedy.

Y'all think we're like
the Kappas or some shit,

it's one big fraternity.
It's not!

It's all jealousy, hate and envy.

Fuckin' crazy, man.

Larry Laughs, what's up, baby?

What's up, baby?

What's up, dog?
Good set the other night

about yo mama and stuff.

Check out Jeff over there,
trying to steal our shine.

Yo, Jeff!

Jeff, what's up, man?

How's it going, bro?
Larry!

Larry Laughs!
I'm a comic too.

Oh! Nice to meet you, man.

What they filming you for?

Oh, it's a documentary.
Documentary, huh?

Yeah.
That's pretty cool, man.

I'm surprised to see you here
auditioning with us.

I thought you were big time.

Naw, man, I ain't big time.

Not no more you ain't!

You still messing around
with them drugs, man?

Heard you used to get
fucked up back in the day.

Hey, Larry, no disrespect, man,
I just wanna focus on my sides,

you know, so I can be prepared
when I go in, if you don't mind.

Well, fuck you then, nigga!
Fuck you and this damn documentary.

That's why you fell the fuck off!

Fucking wannabe arrogant up in here.

Go back to open mike, motherfucker.

You guys, I need, um...
Jeff Woods!

No!
Hey-

I was next.
Oh God, it's good to see you.

I been here like two hours.
What the fuck is this?

Guys, stop stop!

Stop!

How did it go, Jeff?

Fallen off!
He's fallen off!

Go back to your crib.
Okay, guys, settle down.

I need, um... Larry.

This from y'all?

No.

It's from Iris.

I can't believe she still has this.

"Dear Jeff,

every time you look
at this little man,

I want you to remember that
you are a very special person...

who has others
that believe in you.

Most importantly,

always remember to believe in
and love yourself.

Never forget who you are

and what you can do.

Love lris."

Oh man.

So, shit, I told the bitch
"it ain't my fault you ain't cum,

So, shit, I told the bitch
"it ain't my fault you ain't cum,

'cause I'm about to go.
You hear me, ho?"

You get it?
Shit, fuck y'all! Anyway, nigga,

they gave me the light 'cause there some
bitch-ass niggas in this club.

But before I walk off this motherfucker,
my normal routine is

to ask what bitch
in this motherfucker

is fuckin' this nigga
right here tonight? Huh?

Talk to me in the back!

There you go.
Fuck you, nigga.

All right, y'all, uh--

let's get back to real comedy.

Are you nervous, Jeff?

It's like they say:
if you're not nervous,

then you're really in trouble.

All right, y'all. Ladies and gentlemen,
coming to the stage,

my dog, my brother,
my friend and yours.

Ladies and gentlemen,
show some love

for my man Mr. Jeff Woods!

What up, LA?

Oh, he was--

oh my God.

The thing with the bed sheets--

I just couldn't--
he was so funny!

And the letters-

oh, we felt so sorry for him,

but I couldn't stop laughing.

Jeff was amazing tonight!

I mean I don't know where
he's been this last year.

He kinda disappeared
off the face of the earth,

but, I mean I'm glad he's back. The joke
about the Mexican pigs had me rolling!

You know, I don't
know Jeff personally,

but I'm very proud of him.

Very inspirational.

And very funny!

Whew!

Hey, Jeff?
Jeff Woods, is that you?

Hey, brother,
I love your work, man. I love your work.

Thank you.
Naw, what had happened was!

All right.

Is that her?

Can you--
can you stop filming?

Hey, give us a second, fellas.

Hustle some mo'
Panama raw

Name Malone breaks laws,
I'm kinda hot dog

Like stolen credit cards,
hella flaws

Chameleon dipped
with the triple gloss

Y'all niggas lost,
my cup full of the sauce

H2 move like
old-school mob underboss

Might stop row,
my living room filled with my folks

Watching "Afro Samurai"

Getting high,
high-definition screen

1080pi, c'mon

5.3 Dolby Surround Sound

How we get down, clown

Brandish the pound,
disperse the plastic

They making love
to the ground

My vernacular spectacular,
oh, watch the sack

And if Opie be blowing,
you know the five and town

Pressed to bark with the muscles,
though I must confess

That getting caught
with depression brings tons of stress

At least the thing is,
so get your dough, right?

C'mon, hustle
productions, why not?

I keep my bitch...

So this gen' be
in the show, right?

Oh yeah!

Well, like I was saying,

I don't give a damn
how famous he used to be.

Iris is with me now.

I didn't like the way
he was looking at me

when I came to pick her up
the other day either.

He was looking like
he wanna do something.

Now dat is really
motherfuckin' funny.

We have got to start mingling!

I don't even know anybody here, G!

Look, you know how
the game is played, Jeff.

If they don't know you,
they can't hire you!

We're not here to have fun, remember?
We are here to work.

Work it, girl!

Oh-- uh, Sergio!

Hi! Grant-- Grant Flowers.

Oh, Grant Flower. How are you?
Hi.

40 and fabulous!
How are you?

Fine.
Somebody's been working out.

Oh listen!
You remember Jeff Woods?

Jeff, this is Sergio Weinberg,

"Movie Times" senior editor.

I mean senior.

Jeff Woods.
You know what? It's funny,

I thought you were dead.

Oh no!
Oh, you are so funny.

No, actually Jeff is on the verge
of a huge comeback!

Kind of a phoenix
rising from the ashes!

Which I thought would make
kind of an inspiring story

for your magazine-
kind of a Lifetime, kind of Oprah thing.

Sorry, but honestly, had he died,

that would make a great story.

Bye!

Oh please-- snap!
Had I died, G.

Oh listen, please!

I remember when he was the cabana boy
at the Chateau Marmont.

Ignore him. There's plenty
of other people here.

Oh my God!

That's Preston Stone.

Who the fuck is Preston Stone?!

Only the most influential
exec at ADO.

Somebody you should know,
and more importantly

somebody
who should know you!

Come on.
How's my breath?

Go head, I'm following you!
All right, come come come.

Excuse me.
Hi, Mr. Stone.

I'm Grant Flowers
of Flowers Management.

We've actually met about five times.

Okay.
Yes yes, of course.

Of course! Great to see you.
Great to see you again.

Oh hey, listen, have you met my hottest
client, the comic genius Jeff Woods?

How are you, sir?
Uh, Jeff Woods?

Jeff Woods, aren't you
the guy that used to say...

"Yes, what I meant
to say was"?

No, actually it's "Naw.
See, what had happened--"

Yeah okay,
that's close enough.

That's amazing, that's amazing!
I had no idea you were a fan.

I have to tell you, Preston--
can I call you Preston?

--That is a huge honor for us.

A real talent is hard to ignore.

You know, I couldn't agree more.

In fact, Jeff and I
were just talking

and we were saying
it would be fabu--

uh uh, incredibly smart idea
for him to have an ADO comedy special.

Oh, that might be
a remote possibility.

Of course you'd need
a few more credits to your name.

Oh well, yeah of course!
A successful tour.

We're working on that actually.
A few memorable cameos

in some big-budget stuff.
Wasn't I tell--

Breakout performance
in some sleeper indie.

Absolutely.
You know, little things like that.

Absolutely right.
He needs some real buzz!

Buzz buzz, right? Was I--

Yeah yeah.
Absolutely!

You know what?
You are so right.

And I'm gonna be
buzzing around like crazy

getting some buzz for you.
So when I do,

this buzzy little bee is gonna
come buzzing back to you

and we can discuss business--
uh, "buzzness."

Well, I'll look forward to that.
All right, great.

Nice talking to you. Take care.
Take care.

Hey, how 'bout those Lakers, huh?

Oh my God, was that fabulous or what?

That was "or what," G!

All right,
I was a little over-the-top butch.

But listen, I am gonna get
some buzz for you, okay?

We're gonna get a lot of buzz!

And then-- and then--
Buzz?

We're-- ADO, it's like,
"Here we come, ADO."

They're gonna be our bitch.

He said buzzing, he said a tour!

My act's not even together, G!

That is why you have moi.

Smile.

Oh hell motherfuckin' no!

Is that my nigga J to the E to the F
to the motherfucking F?

What's up, brother!

What up, Rick?
What's goin' on, brother?

I'll just...
Everything good, man.

How you doin'?
Life is good, man. Life is good.

I got my TV thing going here,
I got my movie thing going there.

Man, they're even thinking
about putting me in my own reality show!

But you know what, man? Fuck all
that shit. What's up with you, man?

Word on the street is you just
got outta rehab. What's up with that?

Yeah yeah, you know.
Like they say, one day at a time.

I hear ya, I hear ya, brother.

Check this out: I'ma pray for ya.
Thank you.

But I need for you to pray
for yourself too, brother.

Yes sir, yes sir.
'Cause God is good! God is good.

All the time.
I know how the devil can be out in LA.

I know how it can be!
Yeah.

Well, check this shit out, man.
On some real devilish shit?

You wanna step back to the car
with me and do a little bit of this?

You with me?

And the one night I was at, uh...

"The Comedy Crib."

And Grant has some
network execs there to see me.

And I was tired.
I was just tired!

And I just knew I was about to get up
there and bomb in front of them people.

And this other comic--

I'm not gonna say his name.

It was like, "Yo, Jeff,
try this shit right here,

you gonna go up there
and kill that shit!"

I just knew that no drug
could hook me, you know.

So I just--

Man, next thing you know...

I was the funniest
motherfucker on the planet.

I was the baddest
motherfucker in the world.

I was the coolest motherfucker
in the world, you know?

Every time
I got high after that,

I was trying to get back
to that feeling.

I lost everything I had
trying to get back to that feeling.

Everything-

Man, that's the holy grail
of comedy!

Uh-huh!

You know all my success,
I owe it to you, Hugh.

You were the one that kept
encouraging me to get back on stage.

I'm not gonna forget that.

Pause it.

When I get my special,

I want you to be the opening act.

Man, you're bullshitting, man.

Naw, I'm serious, man.

You know how we do.

I appreciate that, dog,
for real.

I love you, man.
Pick your shit up

and let's finish
this goddamn game!

On the real?
For real, between me and you, man?

You don't owe me nothin'.

That's what friends do for each other.
You know what I'm saying?

Yes sir.
They do stuff like help each other,

put people on an ADO special,

and whip their ass! Ugh!

Touchdown, bitch!

I knew I was about
to bust your ass on that play!

Mine's broken.
You see the motherfucker

go up the sideline?
Ass whoopin'! Yeah, it's broke,

just like this foot I broke in your ass.

You know Donna don't
let me play at the house?

We gonna have a footrace next.
I bet you I'll win that.

Oh, you gonna win that.
You're better than me in that.

Iris called me.
We're going to meet at a coffee shop.

You seem excited.

I am, man.
Oh snap!

Naw. See,
what had happened was!

What up, brother?
All right!

Hey look,
I told her when we got there,

I wouldn't have cameras
all up on her face.

So y'all gotta fall back
just a little bit, all right? Cool!

Feeling the way we thought

We flow,
just wanna let you know

Wanna let you know

Never thought I'd fall

Never thought I'd fall,
the magic of it all

<i>Mmmm</i>

Let's take it nice and slow

Slow...

She says she still has
all my letters.

She broke it off with dude too.
That was cool.

She got everything
off her chest.

She really let me have it.

She said she wasn't sure
if she ever wanted to see me again.

So we'll see what happens.

Hello, Iris.
If you don't mind us asking,

how do you feel about Jeff?

That's a broad question.

I love Jeffrey.

We've known each other
a long time.

We'll always be friends.

Do you believe that Jeff can make
a comeback in his career?

I believe that the only thing

that can stop Jeffrey is Jeffrey.

Do you think that you could
see Jeff again romantically?

You know this is my stop.

Um, it was really nice
talking to you guys.

Thank you.

Because of you

I learned what love is

You taught me how

To give all that I am

Stretched out your hands

Told me don't fear

Because you'll be there

To help me through

And now I've fallen

Fallen in love with you

With the woman of my dreams

This day I give to you my heart

I pledge my life to only you

Only you

Only you, only you"

Will have my heart
to the end of time

Only you

I dedicate my life to you

And you alone, only you.

Man, I'm so happy
right now and it's scary.

Damn, man!

I dropped the ball, y'all.

The casting director asked me
to improv some lines and I just froze!

I don't know what
the fuck happened, man!

I just was-- shit!

It's for that new
sitcom too, "Before Obama."

I fucking-- damn it!

They were smiling when I left,
but that don't mean shit.

Damn, I just thought I was
getting it back together too, man.

This Grant right here.

Yeah, G.

Man, the casting director
asked me to improv.

What?

Get the fuck--

you serious?
Yo, G, don't play with me!

I got the part?
I got the part!

I got the part, baby!
I got the part, yes!

I got the part!

Yes! Jeff Woods, boy!

What you know! Jeff Woods!
Come on now!

I got the part!

G, G, we back, baby!
Are we back?

Yes!

I know I'm lactose intolerant,

but this cheeseburger
is worth the gas.

You gonna eat all that?

Every last artery-clogging bite.

But don't worry,

Kenny will be here
with your lunch soon.

Six lines and I stole the show.

Hey, dude, I see you got a real problem
staying away from my woman.

Let her go, let her go...

Come on, let's get closer.

Then you gotta let her go,
let her go

Let her go...
All right, all right.

I got something for you, dude.

I got-- you-- you wait right there,
dude. You wait there.

Business as usual,
buying you designer things...

Yeah, what's up now, partner?

Who's gonna mess with Luther now?
He's got a gun!

Looks like you're going to have
to do a little time, Luther.

Are you afraid of prison?
Man, hell no!

I'm from the motherfucking streets!

These fools in here can't handle me!

I'm running shit!

Yeah.

I want my mama!

Tsk tsk tsk tsk.

What am I gonna do
with you, hmm?

You could have been hurt!
You could have been...

killed, okay?

Now if you're not gonna think
about yourself, think about me.

Okay, anyway,

remember I told you I was going

to buzz up a little buzz?

Well, I wasn't "buzz-shitting."

What are you talking about, Grant?

Oh, guess who's going on tour?

On tour?! For real?
Mm-hmm.

For reals, for reals.
Yes, baby!

How'd you pull off a tour?
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

Sit down.
The important thing is it's a tour!

Yes! Okay, so where
we going first?

New York? Atlanta?
Chicago, baby!

Slow your roll, kemosabe.

Gotta learn how to crawl again
before you can saunter.

Now you're starting off

in Wet Beaver Creek, Mississippi.

Wet Beaver Creek,
Mississippi?

Mm-hmm.

Then let's see,
Cotton Plant, Arkansas-

The Ha Ha Hut.
I heard it's good.

And then we're finishing up
at Laughs and Farts

in Sunrise, Louisiana.

That's the sweet potato capital.
I'm just saying.

Look what can I say, Jeffrey?

It's the chitlin' circuit,
but it's still a tour.

You're right. It's still a tour.

That's the spirit.
It's still a tour!

That's the spirit! Gimme--
Okay, so when am I leaving?

Ow. Oh well, lemme just--
come on.

Let me just cross the "I"s
and dot the "T"s

and then we can-- oh listen,
we do need an opening act.

Do you have anybody in mind?

Yeah, heh heh.

I can think of somebody.

How am I supposed
to deliver mail and go on tour?

You can't!
That's why it's time to quit this.

Look, it's always been
a dream of yours to go on tour,

to be able to do
stand-up full time, right?

Well, here it is!

Look, Jeff,

I appreciate the offer.

Man, I love you for the offer,

but I got a family to support.

I'm talking food on the table,
clothes on their backs.

As much as I want to,

dude, I-- I can't see me

leaving a good-paying job,

benefits for my family

to go on some chitlin' circuit tour
where I don't know what's gonna happen.

I can't see it.

I don't know, I don't know.

Go Mommy!
Go Mommy

Uh-huh uh-huh!

I'm outta this bitch

I quit, I quit

I'm outta this bitch.

Hey hey!

Yeah yeah?

How do you feel Hubert?

I don't know how I feel.

I mean when you want
something for so long,

and then it's right here--

I mean it's real...

I wish I could take Donna
and the kids with me.

My son--

my son said
he was proud of me.

I'm just really thankful right now,

especially to my boy Jeff.

What can I do?

What can I do?

Since the boys have been on tour,

I've spent a lot of time with Iris.

I've always liked Iris.

She's a real sweetheart,
you know?

But I've often found myself
feeling sorry for her.

I don't know how she does it.

I don't trust Jeff as far
as I can throw him,

and I can't throw Jeff
from me to you.

I worry.

I worry a lot.

I worry about him relapsing
on the road with my Hubert.

I trust Jeffrey.

He's worked really to get
to where he is right now.

And I know that
he won't do anything

to jeopardize
the second opportunity that he has.

HEY, guys.

Um...

he said it's okay
for y'all to come in,

but he's going through
a thing right now.

So just be cool.

I see you.

I love you, man.

Every step you take,

I'm with you.

You're not alone.

This is me and you on this ride.

Me and you on the world tour.

When they see you, they see me.

It's our time.

It's our time.

Damn!

I fucking got high, man!

I said I wasn't fuckin'
with that shit no more!

Then I fucking--

what the fuck is wrong
with me, man?

Damn, they say everybody
relapses at least once.

That was my one
and only fucking time!

I ain't fucking
with that shit no more.

I'm glad my brother Hubert
was there to catch me

before I fucking fell
all the way off.

I told Hubert and I'm telling y'all,
I don't nobody saying nothing to Iris.

The last thing I want is
her worrying about me, man.

I'ma fuckin' get right.
My fuckin' head is on straight.

I'm back to business, man.
Fuck that.

Oh, he don't
get high no more? Ha!

We'll see.
We'll see how long that last

'cause he likes the stuff!
I'm just sayin'.

I mean I-- hey!
To each his own.

He could do his thing--
Ow.

--But getting clean
ain't one of his things.

In fact I wish he
would call me back.

I do comedy too.
I'm kinda funny.

Ain't this funny,
when I'm combing your hair?

It's funny right?
Ow.

Ha ha ha!
I mean I wish you well, Jeff,

but good luck, boo.

Did you really make enough
money from the tour

to buy this house?
No.

But it was time to step it up.

It's good for morale.

Iris is moving in with me.

The way I see it,
with her here,

I know I'll stay
focused and clean.

She's a no-nonsense type
of sister.

You know, where I'm silly,
she's serious!

Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

God is good, baby!

God is good!

The comic that was supposed
to be on "The Talk Show" tonight,

he got strep throat,
so Grant got me in.

I don't know how he did it,
but he did it, man.

God is good! I'm gonna be
on "The Talk Show" tonight!

Oh shit!

Whoa-- sorry! Sorry!

I'm Jeff Woods. I'm gonna be
on "The Talk Show" tonight!

I would have hit that bitch
and kept going. Fuck that.

That would have been my intro.
"He killed a bitch on the way here."

Fuck that! I'm goin'
to "Talk Show," baby! Let's do it!

It's "The Talk Show,"

with comic guest Jeff Woods.

It's, um-- it's scary.

I really-- I don't know
how Jeffrey deals with it.

I mean 'cause having cameras
in your face all of the time...

I mean he says
that he appreciates it.

And-- and he keeps me away
from it for the most part,

except for you guys, of course.

I'm really proud of Jeffrey.

'Cause he's really-- he's really staying
grounded through all of this.

Stop.

My daughter sees my heart,
you know what I'm saying?

But my boys-- oh my God.
These two are just--

they're always fighting.
They're always damn fighting.

And that's the thing.
I don't mind their fighting,

but I'm trying to figure out
where it come from.

'Cause I don't fight like that,
their Mama don't fight like that.

But I realized one day

me and my wife,
we were giving in.

Now it's time to bring
a brother to the stage

that has proven that
no matter bad shit gets,

you can always turn
everything around.

Ladies and gentlemen,
my hero, my brother, my friend.

Show some love
for Mr. Jeff Woods, y'all. Jeff Woods!

Is he gonna watch this?

'Cause, you know, if he is,
I got a message for him.

Dude, get it together!
Go back to rehab

and go meditate!
Figure out who you are,

'cause this was some bullshit!
It wasn't shit, okay?

We wasn't happy.
The crowd was booing.

This shit--
the house was coming down.

It was not going on at all.

He was so high. And believe me
I know high when I see high.

Jeff, we fans, man,
we love you,

but that wasn't
a good look, man.

I thought you go
to rehab to get better.

You-- you got worse
in everything-

with the drugs, with your jokes.

God damn!

I mean the funniest thing
is when you walked off the stage!

Jeff?
He's gonna be okay.

He's under a lot
of pressure right now.

And when you're under
that type of pressure

that's when it's hardest
to leave that shit alone!

But all we gotta do

is show him a little more love.

Yeah.

<i>Mmmm!</i>

He gonna be all right. Yeah.

We love you, Jeff.

I love y'all too.

Thank you. Thank you!

Thank you so much for having me.
Hey, sweetie.

Thanks for coming out.
I appreciate it.

My man still. What's up, homie?
Yes sir, you know how it goes.

Come on now, come on!
I'm sorry, can I just--

Not at all. Not a problem at all,
not a problem at all.

Can you get my heels?
Make sure you get the shoes.

It's amazing, man.

Everybody's your fucking friend
when shit's going good.

Everybody wanna work with you.

Phony motherfuckers!

What up, man?
You blowin' up since I seen you.

How you doing? Good to see you, man.
Good, dog.

Yes sir!
You know it, you know it!

Jeff Woods.
What's up, brother?

Big fan of your work, dog.
Oh, thank you very much.

The name is Roosevelt Steele.

Okay.
Roosevelt Steele Management.

Roosevelt Steele Management.
I know you might have

some representation,
but our motto is

"We'll kill a motherfucker
for our client!"

All right.

Understand?
Up-and-coming superstar like yourself

needs a real nigga representing him.
Ya understand?

Well, I have a manager.
This is my manager Grant Flowers.

Grant Flowers, Roosevelt Steele;
Roosevelt Steele, Grant Flowers.

Enchante.
Yeah, what's up?

Oh my! Ha ha ha.

That's cool. That's cool.
Word!

Holla at your boy.
All right.

All right.
Be cool, brother.

Roosevelt Steele would kill...
What was he wearing?

...a motherfucker for a client.

The '80s called,
they want their suit back.

You gotta always watch out
for the sharks, man.

They're always swimming
around your ass,

talking about all the shit
they gonna do for you.

Only thing they gonna do
for you is bring you down!

I got a little something for you.

Hey, y'all,
I'ma catch up with y'all.

Jeff Woods is starting to do
the same dumb shit

he did before all over again.

This past weekend, he and I were
presenters at the "Soul Awards."

Jeff comes out on stage
with a little white clump of cocaine

on the tip of his nose.

On stage,
cameras rolling,

in front of an audience
of hundreds of positive black people.

Coo-coo right there.

Coo-coo!

Can you be honest
with yourself, Jeffrey?

I am being honest with myself!

Are you?

'Cause I-- I know that you're under
a lot of pressure right now

and I wanna support you

and I wanna encourage you,

but I can't go through
that again, Jeffrey!

Go through what?

You know what I'm talking about!

Don't try to play me like I'm a fool!

Girl, you tripping!
I am not tripping!

Jeffrey, it's like
the same thing all over again!

Do you-- do you want
this to happen again?

Why do you keep sabotaging
yourself, Jeffrey?

Jeff Woods?
Aw, no way, Jeff Woods!

Hey, I'm a comic too, man.
I saw you--

I saw you way back in the day.
Ohh, Jeff Woods!

Not right now, man.
What's up, man? What's up?

I gotta take a picture
with you real quick.

Real quick, I'm sorry.
No, now is not a-- excuse me!

Excuse me! Now is not a good time.
This is Jeff Woods right here.

Look at me-- now is not--
now is not a good time!

Jeffrey, move him now!
Not right now!

The only one that
can stop Jeff is Jeff.

He's the only one
that can stop him.

You know, and with
the egos in Hollywood

and the egos in the business
that we're in--

there's a lot of laughter,
there's a lot of ridicule

and I know exactly how he feels.

Every time I get high,
I tell myself this is the last time.

That shit wear off and then I'm...

fucking tripped out!

Yo, when I was a kid--

when I was a kid,
me and my friends we would run...

sun up to sundown.

I had a ball, man,
some of the happiest times in my life!

Man.

I damn sure
didn't need it then.

I'm going to
the support group tonight.

That'll solve everything!

Yeah, we were really hoping
to see Jeff tonight.

But, um, you know,

Jeff's not gonna get clean

until he decides that
he really wants to.

It's just that simple.

Maybe he needs to hit
rock bottom again

before he makes that decision,
I don't know.

But whenever that is,

we're here for him.

I was really hoping
Jeff would make it tonight.

Just to give him a big hug.

I'm not gonna lie,
we're pretty worried about him.

We all know how Jeff feels.

We've all been there before,
you know what I'm saying?

That's why you gotta stay in touch
with people that want to stay sober.

Shit, that's why I keep
coming to meetings, man.

Otherwise I'd be out there with Jeff.

And that wouldn't be no good.

I don't know where you are,
Jeff, but we love you.

And I know you think
the drugs love you,

but they don't.

I don't believe this,
I don't believe this!

I don't believe this.
Where-- where the hell is he?

He's supposed to be on stage-
oh, right now!

Right now is when he is supposed
to be on stage. I cannot believe this!

I've got some very very important
people in the crowd tonight.

Very very important! This is--
this is not-- this is not funny!

It's not funny, Jeff,
wherever you are.

It's not funny, Okay, I don't--
I don't think we actually need to--

to film this part, okay? This is about
Jeff, not about-- not about me, okay?

Uh, I-- do either of you guys
have a-- have a-- have a--

have a Rolaid
or something? Xanax?

Anything?

Oh God, oh God! I don't believe
he's doing this to me again!

I don't believe it!

I was sick, Grant.

I was coughing
and sneezing and shit.

Took some strong-ass medicine.

And that shit knocked me out, man.
Fuck, man,

I didn't even wake up
till this morning, man. I was gone.

Sick?

Sick.

Trust me, Jeff, when I tell you

you could not possibly
have been one fraction

as sick as I was last night.

I had Hollywood heavyweights
there to see you.

I had the people from ADO
there to see you,

to see if you were good enough

to have your own comedy special.

And you didn't show!

I told you the medication
knocked me out.

Oh right, yes. I believe
you were on medication,

but it sure as hell
wasn't Nyquil.

You promised, Jeff.

You promised me this would
not happen again!

I think you're very talented

and I care about you.

L-- I really do.

But I refuse to let you
do this to me again.

Now if you wanna destroy yourself,
that is your choice,

but I will not let you
destroy me as well!

Damn, is you my manager
or my mama?

If I say the medication knocked me out,
that's what happened, God damn it!

If you expect me to believe that,
then you must be high--

oh, what am I saying?
Of course you're high!

Fuck you, man!
No no, there is no need to fuck me.

You are doing a very good job
of fucking yourself--

without protection!

Yo, who the fuck you think
you're talking to, Grant?

Excuse me.
Who you think you talkin' to?!

You know who I am?
Now you're in my space.

You know who I am?

Leave my office! Get out of my office!
I'm Jeff Woods, motherfucker!

I'm Jeff Woods, nigga!
How dare you!

No, stop stop!
Okay, this is enough.

No, you hear me,
I've had it-- stop!

What's up, y'all?

This your boy Roosevelt Steele

hollering at ya.

Yeah.
You know what time it is.

Yeah, that's fucked up
what happened with Grant,

but that's Hollywood.

Sometimes you get to a point

where you just don't see
eye to eye no more.

I mean,

I got love for Grant,

but we were just outgrowing
each other, okay?

That's why I like Roosevelt.

He picked up the ADO negotiations

right where Grant left off.

And he ain't kissing ass
like Grant was!

Now we on some new shit!
Now we on some gangster shit!

This is an important time
in my career-

time for me to go to another level.

I'm about to come with some new shit.

Yeah, I'ma come up
with some shit nobody was expecting!

Sorry, fellas,

we're gonna need some privacy.

I swear, man,
I'm not messing with that stuff.

I need to just shut the fuck up.

I keep saying I'm not gonna do it,
then I end up right back.

I need to start saying it,

believin' it and doing it.

It seems like the intervention
was a success.

Jeffrey's been doing
so much better.

I just think that he needed
to know that he was hurting

more people than just himself.

Jeffrey has a really good heart

and he just needed a little
extra motivation.

Trust me, my nigga.

I know this motherfuckin' business

like the back of my
motherfuckin' hand, ya understand?

And you know what you need?

You need an openin' act!

A motherfucker that's gonna get
the crowd all charged up.

Get 'em ready for the main event,

which is you!
Yeah.

Motherfuckin' Jeff Woods, baby!
Yeah.

You need somebody
that's gonna compliment your style,

your caliber and your
motherfuckin' finesse.

And of course, baby,

I got the best
motherfuckin' nigga for ya!

My nigga!
Nigga, who else, nigga?

Who else gonna fuckin'
hold you down?

Nigga, let's go out here and get this
goddamn money! Fuck all dat dumb shit!

You know what da fuck I'm sayin'?
Me, you-- huh?

And this motherfucker here? Shit.

Nigga!

Yo, let's toast.
Fuck what you sayin.

To success, money,

and mo' bitches!
More motherfuckin' bitches!

Who can't use mo' bitches?

Yeah, nigga! I know I can't.

F.U., nigga!

So Iris is gone-- for real?

That's what it seems like.

I don't know.

Maybe it's for the best, man,
I don't know.

Man, for-- what?
What is going on?

I got a new manager.

A real manager!

We're about to sign
the deal for the special.

ADO?

But you haven't been
doing any stand-up, Jeff.

Like how do you expect
to be sharp for an ADO special

and you haven't been going up?

Okay, forget that!

Why don't we go to the club tonight?

You can do a set, I can do a set.

Shoot, I got some-- I got
a new one I wanna do anyway.

These jokes are so funny.
What do you say, man?

Hey, speaking of the special,
lemme talk to you, man.

What's up?

So I've been talking to my manager...

Well, it was fun while it lasted.

I had a good little run.

I got a family to take care of.

Put food on the table,

clothes on their backs.

And who am I?

Who am I to think that

I could be a full-time
comic anyway?

Hey!

Uh...

thank God they always
got a job for a brother

at the post office, right?

I got a bag full of mail

and some people to give it to.

I might have your shit in here.

I swear to God,

when I see Jeff Woods,

I'm gonna beat his ass!

I'm sorry!

Y'all don't love me!

Y'all don't even know
who the fuck I am!

Huh?

You wanna know? You wanna--
you wanna know really who I am?

You wanna know who
the fuck I am?

Yes! We really want to know.

Who the fuck is Jeff Woods?

Listen closely, you motherfucker!

Listen closely.

I'm motherf--

Yeah, what ya need?!

We want to ask Jeff
how he feels right before

the biggest performance
of his life!

Hey, tell them motherfuckers
Jeff is in the zone right now

and he ain't tryin' to be bothered
with no motherfuckin' documentary!

In fact, y'all are bullshit!

I don't think we interested
in doin' that little bullshit no more!

You heard the man.
Kick rocks!

But-- but we--

Tonight, ADO is proud to present,

starring in his first,
very own comedy special,

Jeff Woods!

Baby, I'm trying to creep low

Don't want to be the po,
forge some credentials

I tinted my windows,
baby, just get in here

You be there,
get in, girl

Ain't no empty space,
just that look in that face...

Jeff, now that you've finally

reached the place that
you've dreamed about

and worked for for so long,

what do you want
to tell the world?

Man.

Life is a motherfucker.

After that, I lost contact with Jeff.

Once again,
at the peak of his career,

Jeff disappeared from the spotlight.

It was as if he had
vanished into thin air.

I was worried about Jeff.

Would Jeff pull himself up
by the bootstraps again?

Or had he fallen off for good?

Months went by.
I assumed the worst.

Then, nearly a year later,

I received an invitation
to a ceremony

being held
at a small Spanish church.

Yes, I do, I will

Share each moment
with you

Our love will fly

Yes, I do

Yes, I do

l do

I believe in you

And everything you do

Through fire, the rain

And the pain we've been through

Hand in hand we'll walk together

As we face this world forever

One we'll always remember

So I do and I will

Go the distance with you

Our love will fly

Yes, I do, I will...

I's married now, y'all!

Said I's married now!

How does it feel to be married?

You first.
Why I gotta go?

Go!
Uh...

it feels different

and the same
at the same time, you know?

I mean,

I always knew Iris had my back.

And now if we break up
I get half her shit!

I think it's safe
to say that we're both

very happy and grateful that things
worked out the way they did.

Very happy and grateful that
things worked out the way they did.

Can we expect any little ones?

Well, I mean I wasn't
gonna mention it,

but--
Oh!

Yeah! Ugh ugh ugh!
Oh stop!

I figure I'd just go ahead
and knock her up real quick, you know.

What now, Jeff?

I'm just grateful, man,

'cause this could have
turned out so differently.

I'm blessed. I'm blessed.

I feel blessed!
Man, I'm doing stand-up comedy.

I love that.

I got people behind me
that love me and support me

no matter how many times
I fuck up.

Man, I don't even think I would have
given myself that many chances.

If I learned anything it's

nobody reaches success
by themselves.

You reach it by standing
on the shoulders

of the people that love you
and support you the most.

You know, so when you
get to that point

that you've been praying
and begging and crying to get to,

you owe it to them
to make them proud.

Last and final question, Jeff:

what advice would you give to anyone

who is willing to listen?

Man.

Just love and believe
in yourself.

It took me a long time
to learn that.

Pshaw-- shit,
I'm still learning.

Thank you, Jeff.
Thank you.

Thank you.

Hey, Jeff,
how about one more?

For-- for the road.

Naw. See, what had
happened was--

As I watched Jeff disappear
in the distance,

I was hopeful.

Hopeful that Jeff had finally slain

his demons once and for all,

hopeful that he'd raise his family

and become the superstar
that so many

always knew he should be.

I'm very proud to say,

Jeff kept his promise.

He never did drugs again.

You know I think it's a damn shame.

I mean, first he kicks the shit,

then his heart gives out?

It hurts, it hurts.

I miss you so much, Jeff.
I don't even think--

I know he's up there,
laughing at us all crying about him.

Shut up,
I know you up there!

We miss you, man!
We miss you, we miss you.

We're gonna miss you, Jeff.
Naw. See, what had happened was--

The day is long

and it's real dark

'cause today we lost
a great pioneer of comedians.

Right here,
the number one comic in my mind,

Mr. Jeff Woods!
We love you, brother!

And I don't care what nobody say.
He will go down as one of the greats!

Yep.
Like a Redd Foxx,

Richard Pryor...
Yeah. Bro, talk.

...Bernie Mac, Robin Harris.

We really cared about him!

He was good.
He was a good boy!

A good, good man.

We just want the world
to know that this family

is proud of our son.
Yes yes.

And, uh...
Yeah.

And, uh...

look, can-- can-- can you turn
that thing off, please?

When I first decided

to film a documentary
on Jeff Woods,

my intention was
to capture the story

of a person
who had fought his way up,

had fallen hard

and endeavored to fight
his way up again.

Luckily, I managed
to get that story

and so much more!

It's funny--

during my time with Jeff,

I felt that I really got to know him,

and barely knew him
at the same time.

Jeff that rare ability

to make you love him,
hate him,

then love him again!

That was his charm.

It was also his curse.

Maybe if we look close,

we can all learn something
from Jeff's journey.

As a very special person
once told me,

life is a motherfucker!

Hey, I'm dedicating tonight's show

and the rest of the shows of my career
to my man Jeff Woods, y'all!

Give it up for Jeff Woods!

And since we're giving it up
to Jeff Woods,

let's talk about
this nigga right now!

Jeff Woods got
this special one time--

nigga left me at home
watching this shit on TV.

I was so goddamn mad.

My daughter gave
this nigga the finger so hard,

I was like, "Bammm!" I was like,
"God damn, go ahead, baby girl!"

His girl Iris is
in the house tonight.

Give it up for Iris, y'all.

That girl--
know you're looking good.

Yeah. All jokes aside,

man, Jeff is somewhere
laughing at us

and high as hell.

Jeff got high off everything!

I seen Jeff smoke
some bleach one time.

I once seen-- I once seen
Jeff high on cocaine, heroin...

and taco sauce!
I'm like, "Nigga!"

Like one time I saw
the motherfucker-- pow!

Right to the vein!
Right before he went on stage

the motherfucker was like--

Then they was like,
"Jeff Woods!"

And he popped up
and went on stage.

Fucked me up.

I couldn't do it like him.

I mean he took it to the edge.

Boy was crazy!

I remember one time, we were on the 101

in Jeff's Bentley.

I think we were going
to our friend Jamie's house

who was having a party
in the valley or something.

Anyway, Jeff is high
as a kite, misses the exit,

does a U-turn on the freeway
and goes up the down ramp.

One time, he stood on the stage

for a whole hour, didn't say nothin',

just stared at the audience.

I mean, no-- no talking,
no cracking jokes,

no nothing, just stood there like
a coked-out zombie and shit.

Just starin' at 'em!
For a whole hour?

Come on, man!
And the tripped-out part about it was

the audience still laughed!

They wouldn't let me backstage, right?

So I waited outside until they
brought him out to his limo.

And when he came out,
I just ran up to him

and grabbed him
and gave him a big hug!

And he looked at me and was like,

"Do I know you?"

Can you believe he said
some shit like that to me?

Sol looked at him and I said,

"Does this jar your memory?"

I used to beat that nigga Jeff's ass
everyday after school.

He was one
of them motherfuckers

who could really make
fun of you though--

talk about your clothes,
the shape of your head,

shit like that.
He was good like that.

One of them witty niggas.

Couldn't fight
worth a damn though.

He was amazing, man.

I seen him kill this dude
for like an hour straight.

Man, one time he said
the dude teeth were so yellow,

he looked like
he had a urine tint.

Jeff had the shit.
Special guy, special guy!

I told him, "Dude, you got it!

You gotta go to LA
and make that money."

Sometimes he come, we see him
in front of a comedy club,

passed out.
You know what I mean? Just high.

Not even off liquor.
"Yo, get up, man!

What's wrong with you?"
"it's none of your business!"

That was Jeff's thing. "it's none
of your-- it's none of your business."

So I just made it
none of my business.

We just hope that Jeff
really does it this time.

Jeff, we love you
and we're praying for you

and make it, baby!

Excuse us, madam,
why are you leaving so soon?

No no, I am outta here!
It is too goddamn wild up in there!

People are getting high,
sucking dicks,

waving titties everywhere,
doing anal, no!

Fuck this!
I am an actress.

And side note:
I can play anything. IMDB me.

So sure yeah, I came here
thinking that I could get put on,

but this is too much.

Oh God, and then Jeff's
shady-ass manager Roosevelt Steele

gave me his card:

"Will kill a motherfucker
for a client."

Really?
I'm gonna give him a call,

but right now, I am outta here.
So, deuces!

Hollywood has definitely
lost a talent, a huge talent.

It's a crime that
I'm selling this book

for only $49.99.

What would you say to your critics

who question your sources
and accuse you

of exploiting Jeff's death
for financial gain?

I'd say fuck 'em!

Naw. See, what had happened was--
