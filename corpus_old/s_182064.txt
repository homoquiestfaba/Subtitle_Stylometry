In 1964, Run Run Shaw

head of Hong Kong's biggest film studio...

gave a rare interview

We have at least 50 actresses

and 24 actors

In Hong Kong
actresses are more important than actors

Because we have more beautiful girls

It's paradise, it's dreamland!

As I look at the heavenly dome

Stars twinkle in the dark night

We cling to each other tightly

Lunching with Run Run Shaw in 1964

are two of his latest crop
of young actresses

This is Lily Ho

Within two years she will be
as famous in the east

as Jane Fonda in the West

Shaw had built the biggest studio in
what was by then

...the third largest film industry
in the world

For three decades

he would provide Chinese cinema
goers with

every possible genre of movie

From epics to operas

from dramas to musicals

But he offered his audience
something else too

Home-grown film stars

beautiful glamorous women
who would...

promote his films and
become celebrities through them

In 1960, the rest of the world
got its first glimpse

...of the truly epic scale
of Hong Kong cinema

And of its beautiful stars

That year
a Shaw film- 'The Magnificent Concubine'

won a special prize
at the Cannes film festival

It starred a mainland-born actress

Li Li-Hua

The Magnificent Concubine is the story
of Yeung Ke Fei

...the Emperors favourite concubine

San Lang

The lavish sets & spectacular
costumes of Imperial-

China, all served to enhance
Li Li-Hua's star quality

Li Li Hua was very beautiful
very intelligent.

She was a big star

very popular.

Everyone agrees she was a superstar.

The Magnificent concubine
plays on an epic scale

At its conclusion

Yeung Pei Fei offers herself
in sacrifice...

to appease a mutinous army

Alright

If you will be loyal to His Majesty...

and escort him to Szechuen;

I will willingly die for it

Li Li-Hua's parts frequently
married beauty & strength

Epics like The Magnificent Concubine
were produced at

...Shaw's Movie Town
at Clearwater Bay

where 1200 people were employed.

There were 16 permanent outdoor sets

with streets, palaces and pagodas

Hollywood greats paid courtesy visits

Shaw wanted to create
a Studio-Star system

in the American style

Li Li Hua was one of his first big names

Already an established actress

she had been lured in 1956 to Hollywood

appearing in the film 'China Doll'
with Victor Matuire

Li Li Hua had an opportunity
to go to Hollywood.

She went to make a film...

called 'China Doll'

But the times were very conservative.

She refused to do a kissing scene
with the leading man

She decided that Hollywood

was too unreasonable for her

...and she returned to Hong Kong.

I think if Li Li Hua...

had been willing to pursue a career
in Hollywood

her style would have worked there.

Li Li Hua was one of the
few Chinese actresses...

to be sought after by Hollywood

But following a rumored flirtation
with Yul Brynner...

eventually she returned to Hong Kong

and married actor-director Yan Jun

Signed to the Shaw Studio

she was now cast in a variety of roles...

to exploit her acting talent

The beautiful young girl...

In the film 'Between Tears And Smiles'

she plays a singer
in pre-war republican China...

who is forced to perform
for a local warlord

I'm your sixth concubine

Who dares come near the sixth concubine?

Sixth concubine...

sixth concubine

She is driven mad

Sixth concubine...

You crazy woman

You're a disgusting sight

Beat it or I'll shoot you

I'll die anyway

What are you doing?

You beast

You monster!

I'll kill you

This performance won her

the best actress 'Golden Horse' Award

When she began working
for Shaw Studios...

she became very, very famous.

Very popular indeed

At the time, film stars of her age...

especially Hong Kong film stars...

were regarded as past their prime.

During 'The Magnificent Concubine'
and 'Empress Wu'

...she was in her late 30's.

You're outspoken

Guards!

Yes

You do believe in the old laws?

A woman in power...

is against them

I'll show you what the law means

Take him out and execute him

Yes

She plays a strong character

...who is independent and opinionated.

She also has a Ionely human aspect

...and a nasty side.

She plays the complexity of
the character very well.

Wait!

Her Majesty pardons Hsu Yiu-Kung

She wants to see him

We don't abide by the laws here

But don't worry

Nobody can inform on us

Your Majesty

Epic costume drama
was hugely popular with...

the Hong Kong audience
at the start of the 60's

The population of the British colony...

had doubled in the previous decade

...as immigrants
from the new communist China

flooded across the border

Shaw offered them an escape...

into an picturesque
and spectacular imperial past

He transferred to the screen
popular Chinese culture

in the form of traditional stories

and what was known as Huang Mei
or 'Yellow Plum Opera'

In 'The Grand Substitution'

based on a Chinese folk tale

Li Li Hua plays a princess

who gives up her baby-son to her retainer

...played by her own husband Yan Jun

to save the child
from a plot to murder him

15 years later the boy returns

Mother and son meet, without knowing

It appears that you've suffered too

The part of the son is played by a woman

...not unusual in Chinese Opera

Her name is Ivy Ling Po

I grasp my sword and go out

Her success in these male roles

would make her...

one of Hong Kong cinema's
best loved actresses

To kill the traitor for revenge

You have to get the character right

and you have to play it well.

It's not easy. Right?

I think...

it was quite a good experience

I never thought of myself

as being abnormal.

Nor did I feel weird about it.

I felt comfortable.

At that time...

Cross-gender roles became trendy

with Ling Po's fame.

In Chinese history...

particularly in the theatre

cross-gender acting was common

both, women playing men and vice versa.

This was a very conservative period.

People didn't want to see...

men and women on stage at the same time.

In 1963 an opera,

'The Love Eterne' with Ling Po...

as the male lead broke
all box-office records for Shaw

It was far & away...

the most popular film of the year

The story concerns a girl

Zhu Ying Tai played by Betty Lo Ti
who...

disguises herself as boy
in order to get an education

Way of great learning lies in virtue

In the scene
the class of male students...

is almost entirely played by women

One must regulate one's home

To regulate one's home...

One must cultivate oneself.

Ying Tai falls in love
with fellow student, Liang Shan

...played by Ling Po

Despite some obvious clues

Shan Po never guesses...

Ying Tai is really a girl

Okay

See, it's as good as new

Good, better than a girl's work

The Love Eterne' shot Ling Po

to overnight stardom

After The Love Eterne...

So after this movie...

Ling Po...

became a household name.

It's also a turning point...

in my life.

Marry you! Marry you!

But you are not a girl

In The Love Eterne,

I like every part of the movie

every scene

but my favourite part

is when Liang Shan Po

realises Zhu Ying Tai is really a girl.

Is Ying Tai really a girl?

Of course she is

He is ecstatic

so happy

and goes to find her.

They'll always be together in this life

When Shan Po discovers
Ying Tai's real identity...

he proposes to her

But her parents...

have already arranged a marriage

But my father has given me

On her wedding day, news reaches her...

of Shan Po's death from consumption

She asks for her wedding procession...

to go by his tomb

That's Liang Shan Po & Chu Ying Tai

Some people were so crazy
about The Love Eterne...

they went to see it dozens of times.

I think it's
because they liked to sing along.

To a Chinese ear the music
was simple to learn

And audiences frequently sang along
with the film

'The Love Eterne' started a craze
for Huang Mei Opera

throughout Southeast Asia

and the Shaw Studios
started churning them out...

mostly starring Ling Po

Hua Mulan was
another Chinese folk tale...

of the girl
who enlists in the army as a man

and becomes a hero

The same story would later
by taken up by Walt Disney

...in his cartoon, 'Mulan'

Don't make a move or I'll kill you

She falls in love
with a fellow General...

who once again

wants to marry her when all is revealed

The script even makes reference...

to the story of Liang Shan Po
and Chu Ying Tai

You and I shared a tent for 12 years

But it is only clear to you now

You are more stupid than Liang Shan Po

It was on the set of Hua Mulan...

that Ling Po first met
her co-star Zhin Han

who in real life

she would eventually marry

although strongly against the wishes...

of Run Run Shaw

The relationship was very strained.

We were young...

and reckless.

Everyone was very unhappy.

They said we can't get married

We insisted.

We continued arguing...

with the studio...

so they gave in and said "OK...

but you have to let...

Run Run Shaw be the witness

and you should hold
the wedding banquet...

in the studio ballroom."

We said "No...

no way"

and they gave in again

and said, "OK that's fine"...

but asked us not to go...

to Taiwan for our honeymoon.

We on the other hand...

deliberately went to Taiwan.

So in the end we went to Taiwan

we didn't have the wedding in the studio

and for quite a while

we were on bad terms with the studio.

Shaw believed that
for his actresses to be married...

was bad box-office

He exercised enormous
control over their lives

If an actress wanted to leave
for a rival studio...

he could be quite ruthless in
trying to prevent her

I kept my Taiwanese passport.

The Shaw Studio had always sponsored...

my work permit.

So they used this as a weapon.

Suddenly without warning...

they withdrew their guarantee.

If this had happened...

I would have been
forced to leave the country.

We have no restrictions here

We have no labour problem

Everybody is willing to work long hours

and they have an interest
in this industry

They feel happy to work for a film

and I think that contributes a lot

With 'cinema-going'

the colony's principal entertainment

Run Run Shaw
used his publicity machine...

to build up a dedicated following...

for his screen goddesses

The Studio produced a magazine
for the cinema-goer...

with articles on the actresses
and the productions

The audience was given story-lines...

for the latest production
in a comic strip

This edition is paving the way...

for the release of
the latest Shaw blockbuster

starring the queen of
the Shaw movie stars, Lin Dai...

in 'The Kingdom And The Beauty'

Lin Dai, who has been likened
to Marilyn Monroe...

was one of the great beauties
of Hong Kong Cinema

With a propensity
for being cast in tragic roles

roles which echoed...

the tragedy of her own short life.

Before joining Shaw...

she was already famous.

But with Shaw
she became even more popular.

Shaw was good at spotting talent.

Lin Dai had that something
which appealed to audiences

So Shaw invested heavily
in two films for her

Diao Sin and The Kingdom & The Beauty

and they made her a big star.

In 'Kingdom & The Beauty'
the heroine is betrayed by

a philandering emperor
who is travelling incognito.

He visits the inn
where she works and seduces her

Next morning she finds out his secret

The emperor promises to send for her

and bring her to court

But he goes away never to return

He went his way, but with her heart

When she gives birth to his child,

she is reviled and humiliated
by the townspeople

She falls ill with a broken heart

But when news of her condition
reaches the emperor...

he repents at last

and sends an escort...

for her to be brought in splendour
to the Capital

But her illness worsens on the way

By the time the emperor sees her

it's too late!

Unhappy endings were popular

even expected in the Hong Kong Cinema
of the period

And it was always the heroine

not the hero who suffered

Cannot forget, cannot forget

In "Love Without end"

Lin Dai plays another tragic heroine

...this time, a nightclub singer-

Li Tsing Tsing

I cannot forget your good

It's impossible to be forgotten

In Hong Kong Cinema
nightclub singer, or songstress

...is synonymous with misfortune

Tsing Tsing, Tsing Tsing

When her ex-boyfriend, Peng-nan

with whom she's still in love...

discovers from doctors
that Tsing Tsing has leukemia

he keeps the truth
from her and offers to marry her

But in the bridal parlor

she overhears a conversation

According to your estimates...

three or four months after the wedding

...she will die!

She decides to run away

What if Peng-nan finds out?

Peng-nan may not really love me

He knows that I am sick

He pities me

Peng-nan tracks her down
to a remote island...

but once again, it's too late!

Be quiet, my child

Let me go in. Please, let me go in

Tsing-tsing!

Tsing-tsing!

In Lin Dai's own private life

both love
and death quartered her attention

At one time

she had been the girlfriend of Yan Jun

...but he jilted her

and married her screen rival
Li Li Hua instead

He wasn't very attentive to Lin Dai.

Say, even if she had been broke...

he wouldn't have bought her
a pair of shoes.

He didn't care for her life

...so she was very disappointed.

Later she discovered...

that Yan Jun seemed to like Li Li Hua

and also had a wife in Shanghai...

though they were later divorced.

She had tried to kill herself once

because of this.

Lin left Hong Kong...

to spend several months
studying in the USA

There she met Leung Chan Chuen

son of a prominent warlord
of pre-communist China

They were married in Hong Kong in 1961

She was four-times best actress;

She had a great career and so much money.

She had married a good husband

had a wonderful

and beautiful child

Her son was cute
and with big eyes like hers

So, to me...

everything about her seemed perfect.

Despite all that...

I never saw happiness on her face

I found that very odd indeed.

When I grew up, I eventually understood.

She had everything...

but it wasn't what she was looking for.

She wanted a peaceful

and stable family.

Maybe her expectations of family...

didn't match the reality.

'The Blue And The Black'
was Lin Dai's last film

A tense drama set
during the Sino-Japanese war

Lin plays Qi
an independently-minded girl...

much younger than Lin's own 30 years

who faces an arranged marriage.

I've been tolerating with you

till now

I don't wish to argue and make you mad

Not because I am scared of other people

She runs away from her aunt's house

to be with her lover Sin Ya

Have you packed yet?

In the emotional melodrama
of the 50's and 60's...

the heroine was expected to suffer

Yet usually it was the woman
who showed strength

and the man weakness!

Qi

But I love you deeply

Can't you do better than just talk?

The audience is mainly housewives
with their kids...

so naturally they choose films
they can relate to.

For example the male character
will be weak...

and the female lead will be exploited

But in the end she triumphs...

through her strength and endurance.

The audience relates to this
and is moved.

In 'The Blue And The Black'

Lin's character supports herself...

working in a hospital

I don't think they're coming, Sir

But then she suffers
further humiliation...

when she is assaulted by her boss

Here, have one more
then I'll take you home

I've had too much already

When news of the rape is reported

she is disowned by her aunt's family
and becomes...

a singer in a nightclub!

I don't know if it's morning...

But Lin Dai never finished the film

One day, driving back from the studio

she stopped to pickup fellow actress
Qui Ping

She said, "Sister Qui Ping...

get in, get in."

I said, "I can't, I have to go home."

She said, "I'll take you home."

I got in

and asked, "What's the matter?

...Why the urgency?"

"Don't go home" she said.

"Come home with me
I've something to tell you...

something very important"

Then she started crying

I said, "Don't cry
you've got everything.

You've got money

fame and love...

and you've even got a child.

What could possibly make you unhappy?

Tell me now

I can't come home with you."

"So many people take advantage of me"

she said.

People take advantage of you?
I was thinking

how can someone with money
fame and family...

be taken advantage of?

Why are you being so petty?

I told her to relax.

"You need to be more like me
more optimistic.

Nothing's too important
every problem can be resolved

You must look after yourself.

Be strong

nobody can take advantage of you."

At this point I arrived home

and got out.

I said, "I'll call you tomorrow."

But the next day she had killed herself!

Chinese communities
across the world were shocked

Thousands attended her funeral
in Hong Kong

For a long time I felt so bad
about this news

...that I cried whenever
anybody mentioned it.

I still couldn't believe it.

One of the reasons I was so sad...

is that I started to realize

Sometimes what we are chasing
isn't actually

what we want.

I don't believe
she meant to kill herself.

I think there may have been
a small intention

On the other hand,

it was meant mainly...

as a warning to her husband.

'Blue and Black' is an exceptional film

because it is Lin Dai's
last unfinished film.

Shaw found a Lin Dai look-alike

Do Dip

I think that with the help
of cosmetic surgery

they made her look more like Lin Dai

...to finish the film.

By the time of Lin Dai's death
in 1964...

Run Run Shaw had begun to gather together

a stable of young actresses
with an eye to the future

He started an acting school for them

and housed them in purpose-built
dormitory blocks

on the studio lot

The new dormitory blocks had a few floors

It was for Yueh Hua, Lily Ho

Chan Ping, Jenny Wu, Li Qing

We lived together on that floor

It used to be quite big actually

There were 2 or 3 bedrooms
and a living room

So, other actors...

Their flat may be smaller

With only one bedroom

I mean
it used to be different for everyone

We listen to everything

We look to their living quarters

their comfortable living

their dresses

their social problems

The only thing that we cannot control...

is their loving affairs

Mr. Shaw found his starlet
by holding open auditions

Anyone could apply

Auditions were held not just in Hong Kong

His biggest star for the next generation

he found in Taiwan

Her name was Lily Ho

Lily Ho was a product of the 60's...

and of direct appeal to
Hong Kong's youthful audience

In search of that audience

Run Run Shaw starred her

in a series of modern roles

They're really rough customers!

Join them and find out what's up

Angel With The Iron Fists aped
just about every aspect

of the James Bond thrillers newly
released in the West

Got a light?

'Flying Horse Nightclub'

Lily Ho plays Agent 009

assigned to break-up the Devil girls

...a group of glamorous female gangsters

Find out where the headquarters is!

Then blow it up!

We'll be right behind you!

We'll capture them all

I'll try my best!

I have a couple of things for you!

Take this handbag

If you press here...

bullets will be fired from both sides

It's lethal within 20 yards

She infiltrates the gang

where failure carries a heavy price

The corrupt member of the group...

will now be punished

The masquerade is over.

Stand up!

What's the meaning of this?

She isn't Lona!

She is a cop!

Who are you anyway?

Agent 009!

I'll teach you a lesson!

Grab her

Among her peers at that time...

Lily Ho was the most feminine.

Cheng Pei Pei is young...

and pure

...and Chun Ping is more submissive
and soft

On the other hand...

Lily's striking feature
is her mature feminine side

Hong Kong's nights are uniquely beautiful

Those 3 actresses Lily Ho
Cheng Pei Pei and Chun Ping

co-starred in the 1967 musical

Hong Kong Nocturne

Hong Kong is a lovers' paradise

Love, like mist, covers blemishes

After their family conjuring
act breaks up

three sisters pursue
their separate careers and loves

Lily Ho's character...

aspires to be a film actress

...but is duped by a conman

Which dress should I wear?

No dress required

No. I mean, which dress should I wear?

Western dress or oriental cheongsam?

No dress!

No clothes at all!

She ends up as a singer in a nightclub!

Woman

Woman

Woman

She's a masterpiece of creation

She's the devil incarnate

she's the devil incarnate

Let me go, let go of me!

There she is rescued by a musician...

with whom she falls in love

But the conflict of marriage and career

Chinese girls of the time...

were not expected to have both

...means they decide to part!

Good bye!

I love you, I always will!

You're the most gifted person...

I've ever met

I wish you every success

Thank you

I'll remember your words

In the end, the three sisters
come together again...

to for a song-&-dance partnership

and the film ends with...

a grand Broadway style production number

Sing!

Dance!

Sing!

Dance!

Dance! Sing!

Hold your head high and strive on

Let no barriers stop your advance

New dancers and singers must arise

Let the world sing with music

Despite her association with...

these modern Western-influenced films

one of Lily Ho's best remembered roles

was in a period drama

...'Intimate Confessions Of
A Chinese Courtesan'

Boss

What's up, done with the checking?

Almost

She plays the part of Ai Nu

...a girl abducted
and sold into prostitution

When she refuses to cooperate

the beautiful brothel owner, Madam Jian

played by Betty

tries to whip her into submission

But there is a deeper sexual
undercurrent at play

You know... you are very beautiful

It seems I'm falling in love with you

In an ancient film, there was

actually such a movie

In the movie

Lily Ho paired with a girl
called Betty who came from Taiwan

It certainly was a breakthrough

to have some lesbian scenes

In that era...

Like the historical epics of Hong Kong

...it had never happened before

I think the performance of Lily Ho

is unhampered by conventions

So I think...

her performance is very sucessful

Four of the brothel's clients bid for...

Ai Nu's virginity

...and she is drugged into submission

Ai Nu attempts to escape but is caught

And you...

do you want to die?

If not, you will obey me

She decides it's better to live
for revenge than die

All right, I'll obey you

She agrees to comply;

Not only with the requirements
of the job, but...

with her employer's sexual tastes

In the beginning there was hatred

and then they developed
a lesbian relationship

Enmity surfaces again in the climax

It's a very complicated and interesting...

...character

Once established, and in demand...

Ai Nu takes revenge on the four men

who bid for her

Wei Chien Chung

Remember the first time you took me?

You too had tied me up then

From that time, I swore...

I would tie you up

and kill you

Now my chance has come!

This character was a good opportunity
for Lily Ho

So, to many people
it's a very strong film.

Intimate Confessions
Of A Chinese Courtesan...

foreshadowed a relaxation
in the laws of censorship,

...which would noticeably
affect the films...

of the 1970's

Li Han Hsiang who had directed

many of Shaws' historical epics...

...like 'The Kingdom And The Beauty'

now turned his hand to erotic films

known in Chinese as Fung Yue
or Wind-Moon films

What is this?

It's a Burmese bell

What's it for?

I performed in many fung yue films

...with director Li.

I've always been very self-confident

I'm not concerned
with what other people think.

Tanny Chen Li,

1seen here in the 1974 film 'Golden Lotus'

was one of Shaw's more prominent stars

who appeared in erotic cinema

To me,

if I couldn't perform in...

many different genres of film...

I would not be a good actress.

In terms of exposing myself...

I knew where to draw the line.

In 'Golden Lotus'
the other star was Hu Chien...

who made seven erotic films for Shaws

Hu plays wife no. 5

to the priapic womanizer Ching Hei-Men

a man who takes what he wants from women
But

there's a moral to the story as
what finally kills him

He is a surfeit of sex

from wife no. 5

Now Ching Hei-Men is dead

He died of too much sex and wine

He was an official and a landlord

But he was also a gangster, a hoodlum

And a sex maniac!

Such moral lessons in 'Fung-Yue' films...

left little to disguise
that soft-porn appeal

In 'Moods Of Love' the temptations
of a Buddhist monk

...well presented as a moralstruggle
for him

transparently offers the audience
something quite different

You're likely to catch a cold

Actually, I didn't depict much of...

a sexual expression

But there's a scene where...

I clutch my Buddha necklace tightly

and let it fall apart

So that it was expressed
in such restrained way

and not by any overt action

Sex scenes today and in the past
are quite different

They used to focus a lot of...

facial expressions in close-up.

The director would teach you

"you need to glimpse left

and smirk and go...

like this."

And we'd do just that.

We thought it was funny...

because most of the directors
were macho men

...showing us these feminine moves.

But in 1978

with a more liberal attitude
towards sex...

censorship rules were relaxed

You couldn't show the private
parts of a woman

But it was alright for the back

And the male actor wasn't allowed to...

touch the sensitive regions of the actress

You know what I mean

Later, the front of a woman's body
was allowed

However, touching wasn't permitted

Run Run Shaw tailored his films...

to the changing tastes of his audience

His leading ladies
starred in historical epics

in operas

dramas

musicals

the erotic

In the late 60's

he had added another genre...

usually more associated with male actors

Martial Arts

I'll settle the bill for one
who is sitting there

Alright

Reckon won't be able to leave
this place alive today

For one rising young star...

it was to herald the breakthrough
of her life

Cheng Pei Pei was just 19
when she was cast

to play the lead in King Hu's
'Come Drink With Me'

Cheng Pei Pei...

is a very dedicated actress.

She is quite different...

from other actresses.

She is a very down-to-earth sort

...doesn't wear much make-up.

She's very serious about her work...

and she's very punctual.

In 'Come Drink With Me'

Cheng plays a legendary swordswoman
Golden Swallow

...trying to release her brother
being held hostage

She has a very strong dancing background

...very good at ballet.

So...

when she's working on martial arts scenes

her movements are like dancing

...very beautiful postures.

She was a trained ballet dancer...

who learned her martial arts on the set

Director King Hu had chosen her

over a more established actress

Looking back on 'Come Drink With Me'

Director Hu had a good vision.

He could make me portray...

a convincing female fighter.

'Come Drink With Me'
is widely considered...

as one of the greatest
swordplay films ever

...and it propelled
Cheng Pei Pei to stardom

'Come Drink With Me'
has influenced me a great deal.

Because of 'Come Drink With Me'...

because of the character Golden Swallow...

I'm still working in action films.

But Cheng's career
had begun quite differently

Her first film
made when she was only 17...

was the Huang-Mei Opera
'The Lotus Land'

...in which she played the male part

opposite the great Lin Dai

I'm not suited to...

cross-gender acting.

Even though I'm tall and sturdy...

I can't imitate the aura of...

a real man.

Ling Po was much better at this.

So my cross-gender acting...

was not very successful.

Also I was quite young

...only 16 or 17

I had too much of a babyface.

In the second part of the film...

my character has aged

So I had to wear a false beard

and it was even less convincing.

Shaws deliberately promoted
Cheng Pei Pei's

...innocent youthfulness
and girl-next-door demeanor

Before 'Come Drink With Me'

she looked set to be the queen
of teen romance

But her success as a swordswoman...

changed all that

By 1969

the press had nominated her
'Queen Of Martial Arts'

Two years after 'Come Drink With Me'

she repeated the same character
in Golden Swallow

But under a different director
Chang Cheh

Little Roc

Don't you realise you're the one I love?

Chang believed that martial arts
was about masculinity

and relegated Cheng Pei Pei's role to...

second place love-interest behind
his hero Silver Roc

...played by Wang Yueh

Of course it bothered me!

But looking back now...

guess I shouldn't be bothered.

'Come Drink With Me' is
simply 'Come Drink With Me'

but in fact I'm really famous
for Golden Swallow.

However I was bothered for...

another reason.

When director Chang first asked me
to do this film...

he didn't tell it the way it was

So I felt a little deceived...

by him.

I was upset

...so I never went and saw the film.

Today Cheng Pei Pei rehearses
one of her daughters

for a stage performance

She left Shaws in 1973

when she married
and immigrated to America

From a certain perspective...

I left when I was at my peak.

If I had carried on...

maybe I could have gone further.

But if I had chosen that way...

I wouldn't have my four kids, and...

I would have missed out
on many beautiful experiences.

But Cheng Pei Pei did
return to the cinema

And is now internationally known...

for the role as the wicked swordswoman
Jade Fox...

in Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger
Hidden Dragon'

Cheng Pei Pei has every intention...

that the tradition of the swordswoman
should live on

With plans to cast her daughter

in a sequel to 'Come Drink With Me'...

recreating for a new generation...

one of the great heroines

of the Shaws Studio at its height.

In the mid 1980's

Run Run Shaw moving with the market...

wound down his film-making business

and turned the Studios over to
television production

For almost 20 years

over 800 films lay in the vault...

slowly deteriorating!

It seemed as if
the great performances of...

Shaw's screen goddesses were
never to be seen again

But in 2001...

the library was bought...

with a purpose of re-releasing the films

Now they would be digitally remastered...

to restore them to their original quality

Hold your head high and strive on

Let no barriers stop your advance

New dancers and singers must arise

It means younger generations...

can now watch the mandarin films
from the time.

Shaws were a movie empire

and they'll be able to see...

those achievements.

Thanks to 21st century technology

the golden age of Hong Kong Cinema

...is now safely preserved
for posterity

Making the screen goddesses
of the Shaw Studio...

truly immortal.

I'd really like to see...

the films I acted in

to see how I look in them

It's already been a few decades, right?

I can see when I was young,

what do I look like

I'm not as pretty as I used to be

I'd like to see how beautiful...

I once was.
