(. ''If I Had $ 1 000000'' 
 by Barenaked Ladies))

You know, you ever heard 
 someone say that old expression,

''Everything happens for a reason''? 
 Well, I don't think that applies to me.

I mean, I spend every morning 
 rushing to work

trying to catch the same subway 
 to the same lousy job.

What's the reason for that?

See, I'm a researcher for one of the 
 biggest publishing houses in Chicago,

but where I really belong is in Creative.

The problem is, is my boss doesn't 
 know it yet, so I'm totally frustrated.

While my friend Paul keeps telling me,

''You gotta be optimistic. 
 You gotta be positive. ''

OK. OK. You know what?

Today is gonna be my lucky day. 
 Today is gonna be my...

Aah! 
 - Oh! Wow!

Hey, look at that, lt's your lucky day, 
 - Did you just see that?

Oh, l've seen it a million times,

You want it? 
 - No,

l don't want it, Go ahead, 
 You got a new briefcase,

Yeah, maybe its got a name 
 on it or something,

Oh, come,,, What are you, nuts? 
 - What?

You're gonna return it? 
 - Yeah,

Did you not just say 
 you needed a new one?

Yeah, when l get my raise,

Haven't you been working 
 there for, like, a year?

l bet Taylor doesn't even know 
 you work there, l'd be pissed,

Are you pissed? l'd be pissed, 
 - Yeah, l'm-l'm a little pissed,

You know, come to think of it, 
 l've never really seen you angry before,

Henderson, you ever 
 seen Tom really angry?

No, 
 - All right, fine, So l don't get angry,

What is that, a bad thing?

lt's, you know, you keep it bottled up 
 and then sooner or later,

you come into work and you mow 
 everyone down with one of those,,,

AK-47, 
 - AK-47, You know, just to impress, uh,,,

Jodie Foster, 
 - Jodie Foster,

 on your day off, all right?

 lt's your Jodie Foster,

Paul, come on, man,

How you ever gonna get 
 to know her if you just sit there?

lt's Taylor's daughter, man, l can't just,,,

You can't just what? Huh? Are you 
 gonna be a loser your whole life? Hmm?

Just go over there 
 and talk to her, Go, Go,

OK, fine, l'm going, l'm going, 
 - You're going,

Excuse me,

Aah!

(baby crying))


Hi, l'm--

Ah,,,

l-- Oh!

Uh,,, l-- He wa--

Oh,

(dog growling))

Oh! Uh,,,

What are you doing to my dog? 
 - Ma'am,,,

Who's taunting my dog? 
 - No one's taunting your dog, He--

Oh! Uh,,,

Um, the-the d-- Um,,,

Here, why don't you take my seat? Here,

Great, Now, that's great,

Two more minutes, and l'm gonna 
 be closer than you are,

Look, Opening, Go,

Just go,

Go, Go,

lt's OK, Go, just go,

 Lake Street is next.

You're Tom Stansfield, right? 
 From Research?

Yeah, Yeah, Tom, Tom Stansfield,

Stansfield from Research,

lt's a growing sport, you know?

Paul, there is no way that she thought 
 that it was a wrestling magazine,

Oh, come on, Get over it, OK?

You're a little embarrassed, 
 lt happens, OK?

Let me tell you something, 
 lf l had a dime for every time

a gay naked magazine fell out of my,,, 
 l'm kidding, l'm kidding,

What? Paul!

No, But seriously, 
 so you're a little humiliated,

At least now we've established 
 that she knows who you are, right?

l'm gonna have to leave the company, 
 - No, you're not,

Oh, God, There she is,

Oh, and l need to see the proofs 
 on Thailand immediately,

All right, What else have we got?

Are you Tom? 
 - Yes,

Mr, Taylor wants to see you, 
 - Oh,,, OK,

OK,

OK, you see? This is your chance, This 
 is fate, This is what l'm talking about,

lt's about that new opening in Creative 
 and you're the man for the job,

You're gonna go in there and you're 
 gonna pitch him those book ideas,

No, l just,,, l'm really not ready,

Let's get to business, 
 Now we're steppin' up, OK,

Come on, You're gonna go in there, 
 you're gonna pitch him an inside curve,,,

Wait, wait, Where is my blue folder?

You don't need it, Enough with 
 the excuses already, Come here,

You look good, You feel good? 
 - l feel like l'm gonna throw up,

Well, that's good, 
 l want you to use that, OK?

What is this? This dad's? 
 lt's nice, Now get in there, OK?

Don't-don't touch my ass, 
 - What? lt was a light spank, lt was light,

Hey, 
 - Hey,

Uh, do l just go in there? 
 - Um, no, He's not finished yet,

but you can have a seat over there, 
 - Oh, OK,

Let me explain something 
 to you, Henderson,

l did not dislike your ideas, 
 l found them loathsome,

l hated them,

You're dismissed, 
 - From your office?

Nice try,

Good luck, You're gonna need it,,, 
 - He's ready to see you,

You can come in,

You know what? We should have 
 never let up after the Revolution!

Sit down, Sit down, Coffee?

We shouldn't have left you at toehold, 
 We should have driven you to the sea!

Now,,, what's this l hear 
 about you making threats

to spray this place with an AK-47?

What?

Oh, oh, oh, No, That,,, 
 l was just making a joke,

Oh, that's funny to you? 
 Killing everyone in this office?

No, No, No, no, no, no, The,,, 
 Paul said how l never get angry,,,

And what about you 
 making fun of midgets?

l never made fun of midgets,

You said it'd be fun to date one

because then you could rest 
 your beer on her head,

No, No, l never said anything like that,

Apparently Henderson thinks you did,

Now l've got a good sense of humor, 
 but that's just plain sick,

But, sir, l didn't say,,, 
 - Audrey?

Which file did l ask you for? 
 - Uh, the Platt file?

John Platt, Not Sam Platt, 
 - l'm sorry, l guess l didn't think that,,,

That's right, You didn't think,

Now if it's not too much trouble, 
 if you could fetch me the right file,,,

OK, 
 - And get Tom and me some doughnuts,

OK,

Now,,, l'm told you've been trying 
 to schedule a meeting with me

about some ideas, What are they?

Oh, uh,,, yeah, l had-l had some ideas,

Something wrong with the coffee? 
 - Uh, no, lt's fine,

Why'd you make a face? 
 - What?

Oh, well,,, lt's-it's a little bitter, but,,,

Jesus, Audrey, get in here! 
 - Sir, really, it's f,,, lt's not a problem,

l've burped up stuff better than this, 
 - Sir, it's fine,

ls something wrong? 
 - Taste Tom's coffee,

No, really, lt's OK,

How would you rate that? 
 - Well, it's not that great,

Not that great? l guess so, 
 Tom thinks it's shit,

Audrey, are you retarded?

lt's not a rhetorical question, 
 Are you retarded?

No, l'm not retarded,

Because a retarded person can make 
 a cup of coffee, Am l right, Tom?

Oh, l,,, l don't-l don't really know much

about the limitations 
 of the handicapped,

l know of an employment agency that 
 hires out retarded people for $4 an hour,

So, if making a cup of coffee is too 
 difficult a task for you, Miss Bennett,

perhaps you'd be good enough to let 
 me know, and l'll contact this agency

and give a retarded person a job,


l wasn't too rough on her, was l? 
 - Well, she is new and all,

Maybe l was out of line, But do you 
 understand what l'm dealing with?

l mean, here l am trying 
 to fill a position in Creative,

and l can't seem to find one person 
 responsible enough to earn my trust,

l sometimes wonder if anyone here 
 even knows what they're doing,

l can understand how you 
 could see it that way, sir, but,,,

So you don't think l was out of line?

Well, if what you're saying 
 is that a company

is only as strong as its weakest link, 
 that makes sense, but,,,

Exactly, That's exactly right,

A company is only as strong 
 as its weakest link,

Yeah,,, 
 - Audrey, get in here!

You were right, Tom, 
 l was too soft on her,

What? No, 
 - Yeah?

Audrey, after talking it over 
 with Tom here,

l've come to realize that 
 l'm gonna have to let you go,

You're firing me?! 
 - l'm sorry, lt's just not working out,

But, sir, l was suggesting,,, 
 - l take my job very seriously,

A chain is only as strong 
 as its weakest link,

Right, but there's a whole other side, 
 - Thanks for the support,

Audrey, empty out your desk 
 by the end of the day,

Fine, 
 - Sir, this,,, l,,,

Thanks for straightening me 
 out there, Tom,

Right, right, But l didn't get to say 
 what l wanted to say,

Oh, your ideas, of course, Schedule 
 an appointment with my new secretary,

Tom, Are you OK?

Uh,,, yeah, sure,

l'm guessing by the way 
 you look he's on another one

of his rampages this morning,

Definitely, 
 - Damn,

l was hoping to catch him 
 in a good mood,

Yeah, that's, um,,, 
 that's probably not gonna happen,

l'm supposed to go to this party tonight, 
 but my dad's making me housesit

for his stupid bird while 
 he's away this weekend,

Well, why don't you go in there 
 and tell him you're not gonna do it?

l can't just,,,

You can't just what? l mean, live your 
 own life and have a free weekend?

No, it's not that,

Wait, it is that, 
 - Yeah,

l should just go to that party, 
 - Yeah, of course,

Well, um,,, OK, l'm gonna 
 go back to, uh, work,

OK, sure,

Tom? l know this might seem 
 a little out of place

because we barely 
 even know each other,

But, do you have any plans tonight?


Uh,,, no, l'm-l'm wide open, 
 - We won't be home too late,

Hey, it's no problem,

So the party starts at 7, 
 You could be at my dad's house by 6?

Sure, 
 - You sure you're cool with this?

Are you kidding me? 
 - Tom, you're such a sweetheart,

Thank you so much, 
 l'm gonna love you forever for this,

All right, Yeah, who's the man now? 
 - See? What'd l tell you?


How the hell could he be 
 so excited about housesitting?

He's nice, Daddy, That's how, 
 Most guys wouldn't even offer to do that,

l don't know if l want him 
 around my bird,

Oh, Dad, will you just relax? 
 lt's gonna be fine, l promise, OK?

l'll check in as soon as l get there, 8:00,

lf l sense anything's wrong, 
 you're coming back here,

OK, OK,

(. light rock)

Very good, Right on time,

Oh, sir, Uh,,, Hey, is that a bear trap?

Yes, lt's to keep the neighbor's kids 
 out of my yard,

Sir, l just wanted to let you know 
 how much l appreciate you,,,

well,,, letting tonight happen,

l mean, l know it means a lot to Lisa, 
 and l think you're doing the right thing,

l don't know what 
 you're planning, Stansfield,

but you're attitude 
 is making me very nervous,

Those socks are clean, right? 
 - Um,,,

You hesitated, Put those on, 
 - Are you serious?

lf you want to watch TV, 
 the remote's there,

That panel controls the lights, 
 alarm, skylight, etc,

Yeah, l probably won't 
 use any of that stuff,

You know, since the party starts at 7, 
 - Party?

l made it clear to Lisa you're not 
 to have any guests in here,

You're the only one 
 allowed in the house,

What? Lisa's not here? 
 - No, Of course not,

Lisa's at the party,,,

and l'm staying here,

ls this concept too complicated 
 for you, Stansfield?

Don't touch the furniture,

And this is my bird's room,


That's cool,

(gasps)) 
 - How's my little boy?

This is OJ, 
 - OJ? Like the murderer?

No, Like the football player, 
 OJ Simpson,

l've set the alarm, 
 When you hear it go off, feed him,

(mice squeaking)) 
 - Aw, What do l feed these little guys?

They don't get fed, They are the food, 
 His diet varies, but they're his favorites,

Hey, don't you have to shut these doors?

Not anymore, He's been depressed 
 since his mate died,

He won't fly, Just sits in his cage,

Medication, Give him two 
 of these at 1 0:00,

l have to shove these down his throat?

Just one, The other is inserted 
 into his rectum,

Don't worry, lt's not 
 too unpleasant for him,

He doesn't bite, does he? 
 - No, Not unless you taunt him,

You're not planning on taunting him, 
 are you, Tom?

No, 
 - l mean, that'd be really sick,

No, of course not,

And the most important thing, 
 make sure he gets a pint of water,

The medication tends to dry him out 
 and then he can't breathe,

OK, 
 - Well, l must be off,

Henderson should be waiting outside, 
 - Henderson? l thought you fired him,

Because his ideas were stupid? 
 Of course not,

He's gonna drive me to the train station,

So, you can leave as soon 
 as Lisa and Hans get back,

Hans? 
 - Lisa's boyfriend,

So remember, uh,,, water in the bowl, 
 medication, and,,,

anything happens to this house 
 while l'm gone, l'll kill you,

(door shuts))

(Paul over phone)) You're housesitting? 
 You gotta be kidding me.


What are you talking about? 
 Don't you see? This is a test.

You watch Taylor's house, 
 come up with a couple of great ideas

and if everything goes smooth, 
 you get the promotion.

You think so? 
 - Of course I do. What could be easier?


(. ''Not What I Wanted'' by Evan Olson))

(Lisa giggling)) What are you 
 doing, Hans? Come here.

Baby, you're gonna burn so bad if you 
 don't let me put this on you right now.

Oh, my God. You scared me, Hans. 
 You're insane. Put that down.

Want to put some on me? 
 Put some lotion on me.

ls Jack around? 
 - Hey,,, what? Who are you?

lt's OK, l'm Red Taylor, l'm Jack's son, 
 l let myself in the back,

Oh, Hey, Tom Stansfield, 
 - Hey,

Tom, nice to meet you, 
 Am l interrupting something here?

Oh, no, Uh,,, l was,,, uh,,, 
 Oh, your shoes,

Nike, Uh, listen, Tom, can you 
 do me a favor? l lost my TV Guide.

l came over here to see if maybe 
 my dad's got a copy of one,

You haven't seen a copy of 
 the guide laying around, have you?

My sister in? 
 - No, actually she's out for the evening,

Bingo, (chuckles)) 
 - Oh,

So, uh, you're here to,,,

Housesit, 
 - Oh,

Yeah, it's probably for the best if you 
 don't, uh, tell Lisa that l stopped by,

Why? ls there a problem? 
 - Well, you know how uptight she is,

Really? 
 - l'm more the free spirit of the family,

Oh, Oh, boy, See that right there?

Kirstie Alley? 
 - Yeah, l dated her maid,

Really? 
 - l boned Kirstie Alley's maid,

And this is while they were 
 making Look Who's Talking ,

Wow, that's really something,

l'll tell you another thing, 
 You know Michelle Pfeiffer?

Yeah,

l did the deed 
 with Michelle Pfeiffer's cousin,

Wow, 
 - Right out there in those bushes,

Right, 
 - Ah, she looked just like Michelle, too,

except she was brunette 
 instead of blond,

and she was kinda short and dumpy,

Well, uh, ya certainly have 
 an interesting life, Fred,

You married, Tom?

No, l'm single, 
 - No girlfriend?

No, and, no, actually l had a girlfriend, 
 but we, uh, broke up,

Ah, 
 - Ah,

Listen, l really gotta get back to work, 
 and since you got your TV Guide and,,,

So, you broke up, huh? That's too bad,

Was your ex a looker? 
 - Yeah,

Yeah, in my opinion she was,

l bet you you still keep a picture 
 of her in your wallet,

Yeah, l do, 
 - Can l see it?

Yeah, l suppose, 
 - OK,

Let me find her in here, There she is,

 Tom, you lucky man!

Yeah, 
 - Oh, she is a real piece of ass!

Oh, l could knock on that back door 
 all day long!

Yeah? Sh-she's a pretty girl, 
 - Wow,

She has gotta be wicked in bed, 
 Tell me she's wicked in bed, Tom,

l bet you she banged your johnson raw 
 every single night,

OK,,, 
 - ,,,'cause that is one fine-looking broad,

All right, Hey! Would ya--

l me-- You're talking about my girlfriend,

Ex-girlfriend, you said, 
 - Yeah, but still, it's,,,

Come on, l'm just making conversation, 
 You know, guy-talk,

Look, l just,,, l don't tell comfortable

talking about my intimate relationships 
 with a complete stranger,

Understood,

Well, you know, given how uptight 
 you are talking about sex,

you pretty much 
 answered the question,

l am not uptight! OK?

Just because l don't feel like 
 revealing personal details

about my ex-girlfriend's sexual habits 
 does not make me uptight,

l didn't ask you anything personal,

Well, then, what the hell 
 do you consider personal?

Well, it'd be like, you know, 
 if l asked you how big your rod was,

Then l would be out of line, 1 00%%%,

No, no! That is no worse than 
 asking me if my girlfriend's a nymph,

l just asked you if she dug sex,

Besides, l wouldn't have asked 
 if l'd known she was frigid,

Yeah, well, she is not frigid!

Are you leaving?

Oh, yeah,

And listen, Could you do me a favor?

lt's no big deal, 
 - What?

A business associate of my dad's 
 is gonna come by to pick this up,

lt's frozen steaks, it's a gift, 
 - lt's not cold,

Dad says that's the way the guy 
 likes 'em, What are you gonna do?

Will you give it to him?


Just one second,


Audrey, 
 - Tom,


Oh, l guess this makes sense, 
 He's got you living with him now?

Uh, no, l'm just watching his place, 
 - (car horn))

He's,,, Jack's out of town, 
 - He is?

Yeah, 
 - Aw, shoot!

l came by 'cause l was 
 hoping to get my job back,

You know, the one that 
 you got me canned from

'cause l made a bad cup 
 of coffee? Remember that?

Listen, l'm really sorry about that,

How can you fire someone 
 for making a bad cup of coffee, huh?

l know, That's what l tried to say to him,

l mean, who do you think you are - 
 Juan fucking Valdez?

l might have had a future at that place 
 if you'd just give me half a chance,

(man)) Let's get a move on, saddlebag! 
 - Oh, my God, That's my idiot boyfriend,

(car horn)) 
 - Hold your pants, you freakin' psycho!

God, He drives me crazy,

Oh, hey, you know, since you're on the 
 rug, would you mind putting these on?

They're medical,,, l got 'em on, too, 
 - Ugh! Licorice,

l hate licorice, l need water 
 or l'm gonna throw up, Ugh!

Thanks to you, l lost my second job 
 inside a month and now l'm flat broke,

You lost another job?

Yeah, l got fired from my waitress job 
 just last Friday,

Why did they fire you? 
 - Oh, l don't know,

One of the assistant managers 
 caught me making out with a customer,

Excuse me? 
 - Well, l mean, actually the customer

was my boyfriend,

l mean, he became my boyfriend 
 after the incident anyway,

You got any beer in here? 
 - Uh,,, Hey,

Here we go, 
 - Would you mind putting these on?

lt's a house rule, Oh, actually, 
 that's a twist,,, Aah!

That's the counter, Listen, Jack, 
 is just a real stickler, That'd be great,

No kidding, l found that out this morning,

 and l'm gonna come in there,,,

Oh, man, Spike's in a real mood, 
 - Uh,,,

Don't even,,, hey, 
 - (doorbell)

Come on, come on, come on, Shit, 
 - (Spike)) l swear to God, Audrey,

l'll piss on this guy's front steps! 
 Let's go!

(knocking)) 
 - (doorbell)

lf you don't open this door this second, 
 l'm gonna come in there and,,,

Hi, 
 - (burps))

(clatter) 
 - Don't worry, Nothing broke,

Hey, Baby, come on, What are you 
 doing leaving me in the goddamn car?

Shake that tail, baby, 
 Come on, Let's get a move on,

Hold your horses, Try acting civilized, 
 - Audrey!

This is Tom, the guy that l was 
 telling you about from the office,

Oh, the coffee dude,

You got some black ass karma 
 headed your way, superfreak,

Oh, we don't need no lecture 
 from you, Mr, High and Mighty,

Hey, shut that sass-trap of yours, little 
 lady, before l bounce you off the wall!

Look, l would appreciate it 
 if you would take this outside, please,

Hey, l'd appreciate it if you'd go 
 and buy yourself a bagel, Jewy,

Jewy? l'm not Jewish, And l don't 
 think that making fun of the,,,

Don't pay attention to him, He's nuts, 
 - l'm nuts?

Who do you think you are? 
 - Look, can we please take this outside?

Oh, come on,

You know what you are? 
 You're a filthy, little tramp,

Me? What about you and that waitress?

Keep going, 
 - l never touched her ever,

Swear? 
 - So help me God,

You swear on your mama's life?

Hell, woman, l ain't gonna 
 swear on my mama's life,

Why not? lf you're telling the truth, 
 - l think he's telling the truth, Audrey,

Then why won't you swear 
 on your mama's life?

Well, because l don't feel 
 like l have the right

to gamble with my mama's life, 
 that's why,

Gamble? But apparently 
 you got nothing to worry about

unless you're lying like 
 a hunk of morgue meat,

Hey, l ain't gonna sit here and get 
 called a liar by no skankin' whore!

Who you calling a whore, 
 you shrimp-dick bastard?!

Audrey, see now 
 you're just provoking him,

That's a vicious, flat-out, 
 bold-faced lie and you know it!

ls it? ls it? l don't think so! 
 - l'll whip it out right now!

No, no, no, l don't wanna see it, 
 - l'm gonna whip it out right now

and prove to you that she's a lying slut!

Keep your meat in the fridge! 
 - You wanna see my piece?

All right, All right! That is enough! 
 - Go get me a ruler, Tom! You go get,,,

That is it, l don't care 
 if you have a tiny shrimp dick!

Or a giant whale dick, which that's,,, 
 - Goddamn it, Audrey!

You tell him you're a liar or l'm gonna 
 smash your face in, l swear!

Wait a minute! You put that down! 
 - All right, Can we please just use fists?

Come here, you little,,, (slap)) 
 - You hit me, you bastard!

l did not and you know it! 
 - He hit me!

He hit me as sure 
 as l'm standing right here!

Did you hit her, Spike? 
 - Yes,

With an open hand, 
 lt was with an open hand,

So what if it's open? 
 - You can't,,,

Then it don't count, 
 - Says who?

Says anyone, Ask the Jew,

All right, that's it, 
 You two have got to leave,

All right, that's fine, 
 But she is not coming with me,

You are not welcome in the double ride,

Fine, l don't care, l don't need your lousy 
 trailer, l'll stay right here with Tom,

Fine, Stay with Tom, 
 - l'll stay right here,

Wait a minute, Whoa, Guys, you need 
 to try to work this thing out,

He hit me! He knocked me on my can! 
 - l know, l know,

Well, but it was with 
 an open hand after all, and,,,

Relationships have their 
 ups and downs, you guys,

and you don't want to ruin this great,,,


Oh, God, The bird, OJ!

Oh, my God,

(continues yelping))

(squeals)) 
 - Oh,

You come back here or Tom's 
 gonna kick your butt! So take that!

(revs engine)) Ooh, l'm shaking 
 in my boots, baby!

Look at those two, OJ,

(phone ringing))

 running away, dummy!

Hello? 
 - (Lisa)) Hi, Tom. How are ya?

Hey, Lisa, l'm great, l'm great, 
 - (squawks))

ls that OJ? 
 - Yeah, yeah.

We just had a little drink of water, 
 - l haven't heard him squawk in years,

Oh, yeah, 
 He's quite the crazy bird, you know,

Yeah. Anyway, Tom, 
 I just wanted you to know

how much I appreciate 
 you helping me out tonight.

But l'd like to crash at a friend's place 
 tonight after the party,

Would you think it was horrible if l asked 
 you to stay the whole night tonight?

Oh, well,,, l-l don't think your dad 
 would want me staying here,

Please? 
 - Yeah, l suppose l could stay,

Thanks, Tom. I really appreciate it. 
 See you tomorrow. (hangs up))

 sure as hell ain't scared neither!

Butthead! Loser!

(tires screeching))

Oh, my God, Thank God he's gone, 
 Hey, so is it OK if l stay here tonight?

Oh, man, it's,,, it's not even my house,

Oh, yeah,

OK, Well, l sure as hell 
 don't want any charity,

l mean, it's not like you 
 owe me anything, so,,,

And l'm sorry about 
 that whole office thing,

l know that you didn't mean 
 to get me fired,

Yeah, You didn't deserve to get fired, 
 - Thanks,

OK,

Well, l guess l'll just go try

 attraction between us, you know?

Yeah,

You know, there's none 
 of that sexual tension,

Why would your father say that l'm gay?

l don't know, Well, you can't blame him 
 entirely, l mean, you are a little feminine,

(gasps)) 
 - Don't be hurt,

lt's OK,

Hans is a bit of feminine, too,

What exactly did Hans do anyway?

Well, it's not like he did just one thing,

lt's more about trust,

Who's your boss? 
 - Jack Taylor,

Jack Taylor, huh? l did time 
 in Joliet with a Jack Taylor,

Average height, medium hair, 
 horrible case of folliculitis on his ass?

l wouldn't know about the folliculitis, 
 - l thought you said he was your boss,

He is, 
 - And you never saw his ass?

Why would l see my boss's ass? 
 - lt stands to reason,

You work for a guy long enough, 
 sooner or later,

you're gonna get a glimpse of his ass,

Listen, l-l don't know 
 what line of work you're in,

but l've never seen my boss's ass,

Hey, man,,,

 - Yeah, That's what l wanna know,

What's going on with your dad's gift? 
 See,,, Do you see that guy?

He was gonna kill me!

Don't you think you're 
 overreacting a little, Tom?

Overreacting? The guy had a knife! 
 l don't think that l am overreacting!

He probably just had the wrong address,

l mean, there's gotta be over a dozen 
 Jack Taylor's in Chicago alone,

l'm gonna go to my dad's bedroom, 
 You tell me if the guy shows up again,

All right, All right, You listen to me,

You're not even supposed 
 to be in this house,

What, you surprised she'd go out

Let me get you a tissue, 
 - Thank you,

Whoa, Hans, you know what?

Maybe right now isn't a great time 
 for you to see Lisa,

What say, uh, we get you a drink?

Oh, OK, Yeah, she's 
 probably really upset,

You see, we got in a misunderstanding 
 tonight and, well, she left me,

Wow, that's unfortunate, 
 - Yeah,

Uh, what happened?

Well, l think seeing me naked from 
 behind like that kind of shocked her,

Oh, So, tonight was the first time,

Yeah, Tonight was the first time, 
 lt was awesome,

l mean, l was lying up on the bed like 
 this with one leg straight up in the air,

l don't think l really need to see,,,

Whoa,

Hans, Hans, No,,, you cheated on her,

You know something, Tom? 
 You're right,

Aw, l guess that was cheating, 
 And now l've gone and lost everyone,

l should have known 
 from the start it wasn't right,

She kept telling me 
 l reminded her of her dad,

Hans, you gotta realize 
 that this is over, you know?

And you gotta put an end to it, 
 and-and move on,

And get yourself to a better place, OK? 
 - Yes,

l think you know what l mean, 
 - Yeah, l do know what you mean,

And l'm ready, l know what l have to do,

Well, l guess this is good-bye,

l got 'em from Speed, Here, 
 So strong, so be careful,

lt's powerful stuff, 
 - Here, Just one,

Be careful,

Hey, Excuse me,

You know, l just wanted to apologize 
 for pulling that gun on you earlier,

That was totally out of line,

Hey, you know, l don't 
 even know your name,

l'm TJ, 
 - TJ? That's nice,

l guess maybe l was out of line 
 by pissing all over everything,

Man,,, that was funny, (laughs))

Yeah, l've always enjoyed a good prank, 
 What are you drinking there?

Whiskey, You want some?

There's plenty of booze 
 around here, that's for sure,

Yeah, l'll take a shot of bourbon,

Oh, my God! Wow! 
 - What?

Whoa! Look at those 
 two blondes going at,,,

Oh, wait, are there three of them? 
 - Where?

They're going at it right up there 
 on the second floor,

Where are you looking? 
 - Right th,,, uh,,, Oh, man, they left,


Damn, l was all psyched up 
 for some action,

Lesbians are very special,

Oh,,, Hey, l'll drink to that, huh?

Cheers, 
 - All right,

Mmm,

(grunts)) 
 - Oh, are you,,,

Whoa, 
 - Here, Why don't l,,,

(glass breaks)) 
 - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,

(steps on glass))

Whoa, 
 - (gong))

Audrey? 
 - (babbling))

Audrey!

 He's like a human vibrator,

What,,, All right, 
 what is wrong with him?

l don't know, Did you slip him the pill? 
 - Yes,

Then that must be it then,

You didn't give him the pill 
 with whiskey, did you?

Yeah, 
 - Oh, no!

You're not supposed to mix the two, 
 - Audrey, you did not tell me that!

Everyone knows that you're not 
 supposed to mix booze with pills!

Come on! 
 - OK, ls he gonna be OK?

Don't worry, He'll be fine, 
 l used to be a paramedic,

Tom? l think l found OJ, 
 - OJ? l don't care about,,,

We have a situation here, 
 Audrey, call 91 1 !

l'm telling ya, he'll be fine, 
 - Are you sure?

He just needs some rest, l'm positive, 
 - OK, You watch TJ, Use this,

lt's not loaded, but he doesn't know that,

(doorbell) 
 - Oh, man!

Oh, hey, 
 - Julie,

From,,, yeah, 
 - Down the block, That's right,

You mind if l come in?


Why don't we go 
 to that room over there?

(Speed) OK, yeah, l got this end, 
 - (Audrey)) Man, he's heavy,

Do you mind if l sit down?

Uh,,, yeah, Sure, 
 - Thank you,

Oh, hey, Sorry to butt in, Hi, l'm Red,

Hi, it's nice to meet you, 
 - Nice to meet ya,

Anyway, l realized you were telling 
 the truth when my real date showed up,

Of course he didn't stick around, 
 - Well, that guy is a bum,

Well, l'm sure that had 
 nothing to do with you,

No, l know it did,

l've never had any guys attracted to me, 
 even before the accident,

Now that cannot be true,

Well,,, about six months ago, 
 l was hitchhiking

and a trucker tried to rape me, 
 but other than that,,,

Come on, You're gonna tell me, 
 you never had a real boyfriend?

Well, once, but l think 
 he just felt sorry for me,

Oh, well, uh,,, how long did that last?

Um,,, about six years 
 and then one day, he just left,

Another woman? 
 - No, He got hit by a bus,


Well, he didn't seem to try 
 very hard to avoid the bus,

l think he just wanted 
 out of the relationship,

Julie, why don't you sit in this chair?

Oh, geez, l'm starting 
 to feel a bit woozy,

(blood squishes))

OK, All right, l have to go find OJ,

So, Red, if you could watch things 
 for me, that'd be great,

Got ya,

Look, l think you're being 
 way too hard on yourself,

l mean, besides, l bet there've been a lot 
 of guys who've been attracted to you,

No, he was the only one,

What about that trucker? l mean, 
 he was obviously attracted to you,

 would have raped anyone,

l doubt that, You were probably 
 pretty special to him,


l'm not just jerking 
 your chain either, l mean it,

(giggles)) 
 - Yeah, (chuckles))

What are you doing to the lawn? 
 - lt's OK, Tom, We just had to bury TJ,

Bury,,, what? You mean, he's,,,

You said he was gonna be OK! 
 l thought you were a paramedic,

Well, l took a course, 
 - You took,,, you-you guy,,,

You can't just bury him, you guys!

Well, we're not gonna put him in my car,

(Audrey)) That's right, 
 - All right, Forget it, l'm calling 91 1 ,

That's for emergencies, 
 - What do you think this is?

The guy's dead, ln 20 minutes, 
 he's still gonna be dead,

There's no sense of urgency here, 
 - (chuckles))

No, we have to call the cops 
 and report it!

And tell 'em what? 
 - The truth! That there was a,,, accident,

They might not see it that way, 
 - Let's face it, Tom, You did kill him,

You gave me the pill, 
 - Hey, l didn't tell you to kill nobody, OK?

Well, you didn't tell me 
 not to use the whiskey!

Well, if you'd listen to me,,, 
 - You didn't say anything about whiskey!

(whistles)) 
 - l would think you would listen to me!

There's no time for blame games,

Why don't you spread around 
 some leaves? Make it look good,

l am not gonna help 
 you conceal a dead body!

Hey, you know what? Don't you 
 think we should say something?

What? 
 - You know what? She's right,

Some kind of last rites or eulogy 
 or something like that?

l'm so screwed, 
 - We should say something,

Fine, fine, You know what? Say 
 something, Get,,, just make it quick,

Lord, this day we lay to rest TJ, 
 who was, uh,,,

l really didn't know him, 
 - l don't know him,

l mean, Tom, you know him the best, 
 Why don't you say something?

Me? 
 - Yeah,

All l know is that the guy was a violent, 
 sadistic goon that was into lesbians,

Amen,

Tom? 
 - Lisa,

l can't believe you're still here, 
 - Listen, please,

You have to let me explain,

Look, Tom, Tonight was just a 
 big mistake, That's all there is to it,

No, you,,, that,,, what you saw with 
 the girls, all that was was weird timing,

Red? What's Red doing here?

Red? Oh, uh, Red 
 was in the neighborhood

and he-and he stopped by,

But, you see, nothing really 
 bad happened tonight,

ls he the reason OJ's gone? 
 - No, No, uh,,, OJ got loose,

And that's a little problem, 
 But we're gonna find him,

And we're looking for him, so,,,

What's this?

Oh, uh, Tom killed a guy 
 and we're burying the body,

OK, that was bad, 
 - Aah!

OK, well, now you're 
 overreacting, lt's not,,,

Oh! 
 - Aah!

(all yelling))

All right, all right, hey,

Anybody moves, there's gonna be 
 a big hole where her brain used to be,

Yeah, Go ahead, shoot,

Well, what are you waiting for? 
 Come on!

What are you waiting for?! 
 Waste the bitch!

Tom! 
 - No, l don't give a shit!

Hey, l'm not joking, asshole, 
 - Yeah?

Pull the trigger, Come on, Come on!

l think you're just all talk,

Looks like we both got guns,

Who's gonna shoot first this time?




Tom! You are so brave,

No, no, lt's not even that big of a deal, 
 This gun's not even loaded,,,

(gunshot) 
 - (grunt)


l never should have doubted you, 
 You risked your life for me,

Audrey found some bullets in 
 the kitchen and l may have reloaded it,

Yeah, l did,

Yo, excuse me, Does anyone here 
 know a Jack Taylor?

Why?

This dude just called, said if l don't pick 
 him up at the train station in 1 5 minutes,

l'm out of a job, What do 
 you suppose that means?

Oh, my God,

That's what l thought, 
 'cause l ain't got no job,

He's coming home early, 
 - OK, don't worry about it,

l'll take care of everything, OK? 
 Trust me, Just don't drive too fast,

Got it,

And, um, maybe you 
 should put that away,

Oh, God,

(. ''Go Home'' by Barenaked Ladies))

Ooh,



(. whistling))

l knew that was you,

(beer bottles clank)

 for the meeting on Monday afternoon,

Yeah, We can pick it up 
 when we refuel in Hawaii,

Hey, uh, do you wanna stop 
 and, uh, get something to drink,

go to the bathroom or something?

We'll take the departmental heads now

and the Creative team 
 in a couple of weeks,


That's the agenda up to lunch, 
 then there's lunch,,,


OK, And then,,, 
 - (squawks))

(horns honk) 
 - (tires screech))

OK, OK,

OK, fine,

Stansfield, what are you doing? 
 - Nothing, sir,

Hold on a moment, please,

Stansfield,,, why don't you 
 just concentrate on the driving

and let me get on with making my call,

Wait! 
 - What is it now, Stansfield?

Oh, nothing, sir, Almost home,

Hey, How'd this get in there? 
 - Oh, be careful with that,

l will, Good thing l found it,

There's several ways to properly 
 dispose of a handgun,

none of which include 
 putting it in a garbage bag,

(cop over megaphone)) 
 Freeze! Police! Freeze!

Let go of the girl 
 and put your hands in the air!

You're completely surrounded, TJ!

Put down your weapons 
 and put your hands on you head!

No, you guys, Wait, He's not TJ, 
 l'm Lisa Taylor, This is my dad's house,

Ma'am, we've received 
 numerous reports

from this neighborhood: theft, gunfire,,,

All right, Look, l know you probably 
 think we may have killed somebody,

but Tom didn't know 
 he poisoned the guy,

and we thought he was dead when 
 we buried him, But he seems OK now,

His head's just a little bloody 
 from where we hit him with the shovel,

And l swear when Tom shot the gun off, 
 he didn't think it was loaded

'cause l put the bullets back in, 
 so if you'll all just step inside,

you'll see there's nobody dead here,

He may have had the wind 
 knocked out of him temporarily,

but with a little first aid, 
 l think he'll be just fine,



(screams)) 
 - (screams))

Holy mother of God!


Yes, l see, l see,

(squeaks)) 
 - OK, fine,

(squawking)) 
 - Whoa!

Could you say that again? 
 You're breaking up!

One moment, please, OJ!

(tires screeching))

l just can't understand why you would 
 do this, Hans, what were you thinking?

He'll be fine, He may complain 
 about a sore throat,

but he's in a lot better shape 
 than this chandelier,

Well, l'd hate to be here 
 when the owner gets back,

You can say that again,

(man)) Whoa! 
 - (car horn))

Tom! Daddy! 
 - What do we got?

What was that? 
 - Watch the glass, OK, everybody?

Let's get 'em out of the car, 
 - Oh, my God! Daddy!

Everybody, stay back and remain calm, 
 - (Lisa)) Are you all right?

That's him, That's the one spying 
 on me through the bushes,

He shot the bullet right through 
 my Julie's bedroom window,

Here, Tell 'em, Julie,

You guys, Tom wants the body in here,

(TJ)) Take it easy, Put me down, 
 - (gasps))

Stansfield, what have you done?

Lisa, pack your things, 
 You're coming with me to Thailand,

No!

Get his ass out of here,

lt's funny you should mention 
 the word ''ass'', Jack,

Why don't we start 
 by talking about yours,

Excuse me?

Lisa, your father is not 
 who you think he is,

The whole publishing operation, 
 lt's a great cover,

Now how'd you do it? What'd you do? 
 Did you hollow out the books?

Oh, and locating the plant 
 in Thailand, lt's genius!

What are you talking about? 
 - What am l,,, Jack,

You know, l-l would've believed 
 you, Jack,,, until l met this man,

who seems to know a lot about ya,

Recognize this? l hear it's very 
 effective in relieving folliculitis,

l don't have folliculitis,

He's given me no choice,

He's given me no choice! 
 - Tom, what are you doing?

This is insane! 
 - Yeah? Take a look at your dad's ass,

No! 
 - Then tell me l'm insane, huh?

(all) Oh! Ooh! 
 - Huh? Huh? Look at it!

Look at it! Huh? Huh?

Ooh,,, 
 - What?


l told you l don't have folliculitis, 
 you blithering idiot,

Well, guys, the ointment 
 must have worked,

Let's go,

Wait! l have something to show ya,


 and the ass cheeks?

My real name is Jack Taylor,,, Jr, 
 Red is my nickname,

Now you know why, 
 l'm the whole reason that TJ's here,

Goddamn it, Red, You've been 
 dealing drugs out of my house!

No, Dad, l swear, 
 l gave this guy a bag of flour,

l dumped a kilo of the real stuff 
 down the toilet,

l'm finished dealing for good,

The lime green toilet 
 with the wooden seat?

Yeah, why? 
 - (squawking))



Wait a second, He's flying,

He's flying,



(OJ squeals)) 
 - (car horn))

(tires screeching)) 
 - (crash))

Get him out of my sight, Now, 
 Lisa, let's go,

That's the one, He got my ear! 
 Evander Holyfield's ear,

You have to right to remain silent, 
 Anything you say can and,,,

Lisa, wait!

 for God's sake,

(thunder rolling))

(squawking)) 
 - OJ?

OJ! Come to Daddy, 
 How's my little boy?


You're going with him? 
 - What choice do l have? He needs me,

Are you actually feeling sorry for him?

He's manipulating you 
 and you are buying it,

All right, fine, You do what you gotta do, 
 l am gonna bail Tom out of jail,

With what? Your drug money?

No, no, no, l stole this out of Dad's safe,

Look, the important thing is, 
 somebody has gotta help Tom,

You know that nothing that happened 
 here last night was any of his fault,

lt's funny, The nicest guy in the world's 
 the only one with enough balls

to stand up to Dad,

All he wanted to do was 
 to spend some time with you,

Look what it gets him,

Classic Dad, l'm not allowed in the 
 house, you're not allowed out of it,

He doesn't care about us, 
 Only that stupid bird,

Hey, Red, can l tell you something? 
 - Sure,

l know this is gonna sound weird, 
 but ever since l was a little kid,,,

l used to always wish 
 that l was that stupid bird,

Aw,


Look, l think it's about time 
 you talk to Dad,

At least tell him how you feel, 
 You can do it,



Don't you see, we have no reason 
 to be afraid of him?

Aah! 
 - (screaming))

Aah!


(yells)) 
 - (thud)

Daddy! 
 - Lisa, don't let him do this to you,

Lisa! Aah!

Lisa! 
 - Tom!

Red bailed me out,,, and told me you 
 were here and l'm not letting you go,

Yeah, but l'm,,, 
 - No, You're gonna let me finish,

l went through hell last night and it was 
 my fault 'cause l let people do it to me,

And now you're gonna 
 make the same mistake,

Yeah, but,,, 
 - This isn't what you want,

This is what your father wants, 
 And you know what?

Maybe you and l,,, never 
 are gonna work, And that hurts,

But not as much as watching you 
 be controlled by a ruthless tyrant

that would screw his own mother 
 if he thought it'd help him get ahead,,,

Tom! l'm not going,

She's-she's not going,

ls this whole concept too complicated 
 for you, Stansfield?

No, No,

All right, (chuckles))

Wha,,, l,,, What made you stay?

That,

How did you guys,,, 
 - We finally had our long overdue talk,

Then-then who's taking 
 your place in Thailand?

He is, 
 - (gong))

What's this? 
 - (neck cracks)) Ow!

l'm kidding, 
 - l don't wanna go, l'm afraid,

Nonsense, Everyone knows that, uh,,,

Asian people are very 
 intimidated by, uh,,,

Tall men? 
 - Canadians?

Republicans? 
 - Blacks?

Henderson? 
 - Yes, sir,

l won't have that kind of thinking 
 in this company,

There's no room for racism here, 
 You're fired,

Now, Tom, the point that l'm getting to 
 is that with a big part of the team away,

l'm gonna want you to take over 
 the Creative Department,

Me? 
 - No need to be modest,

l saw those ideas you left 
 in the living room,

Your theory on the JFK thing, brilliant, 
 And the moon landing, a hoax?

You're really on to something there,

That's the kind of thinking 
 that's gonna sell books,

Uh, thank you, sir,

Bye, Daddy, Have a safe flight,

Well, Dad,,, that's fantastic, 
 You promoted Tom,

Yeah, well, l figure anyone who's got 
 the guts to piss on my Persian carpet

has gotta have what it takes, 
 Stansfield!


What the hell are you doing? 
 - Just trying to get my job back, sir,

(. ''If I Had $ 1 000000'' 
 by Barenaked Ladies))

(Lisa squeals)) 
 - (chuckles))

 that happened, after all I went through,

I guess it was my lucky day. 
 And I'm not the only one.

Based on Lisa and Red's suggestions,

Jack restructured the company 
 from top to bottom.

Even instituting casual 
 Fridays every day.

And last Friday was Henderson's 
 2 7th straight day on the job

without being fired.

OJ's back off the drugs 
 and now he only drinks beer.


 an occasional flashback.


Jack begged Audrey to come back, 
 but she got a job

at, of all places, a coffee shop.

Ew! 
 - Ugh!

Ew! 
 - Ew!

This is terrible!

Hans succeeded in turning around 
 the company's factory in Thailand.

But apparently he's still struggling 
 to cope with the local customs.

Back of bus! 
 - Excuse me?

You people belong back of bus, 
 - That's an outrage!

Man, l'm not gonna let you treat me 
 like that merely because l'm,,,

Smoking! Smokers belong back of bus!


As for me, with my new promotion,

I could at last write books 
 based on my own experiences.

So I did. 
 - Thank you,

And Lisa was finally able to pursue 
 a career that she loved.

You know, you ever heard 
 someone say that old expression.:

''Why does everything bad 
 always happen to me?''

Well, I don't get those people... 
 'cause I've learned that if they just stop

and look around, they'd realize 
 that everything happens for a reason.
