[music playing]



[man 2] Mm-mm.

[man 2 laughing]

[woman] This is ridiculous.
Mm-hmm.

That's actually impressive.
You're kidding me.

[man] Cough it up, baby.
Okay.

I'm gonna give you five.

I don't know how you do it, man.

I'm just blessed.
[woman] Hmm.

Thank you for contributing
to my slush funds.

Jesus.



You should get an exterminator.
Yeah, that's above my pay grade.

Oh, my God.
Oh, geez.

[man laughs]
You're such an asshole.

You know, they say when you see one,
there's thousands more in the walls.

Shut up, Jeffrey.
[man] Yeah, shut up, Jeffrey.

Why don't you make me?

Make me shut up.

[clears throat]

Don't mind me.

Trash coming through.

[man 3 retching]

[man 3 coughs]

How you living, Eric?

Large.
Expect nothing less.


you drink for free.

No. [chuckles]
[man] Just saying.

Oh, yeah?
That's bar policy.

You get naked, it's free drinks all night.

Isn't that right, Mary?

Damn right.

I don't make the rules.

Come on. Give me a shot.

Now we're talking. Now we're talking!
Line 'em up.

Maybe you will see something
by the end of the night.

Don't you tease me.

Where you going?
I'm just going to the bathroom, babe.

He seems like a good kid.

He is a good kid. [laughs]

Wonder how long this one's gonna last.

I'm kidding! Come on, look...

May you both live happily ever after.

Cheers.

Nah, I'm going to wait for my boyfriend.

Your loss.

[door opens and closes]

M'lady.
[rattling]

Who the fuck are you, man?
Whoa, whoa. Eric!

Who the fuck are you?
Hey! Eric! He's with me.

That's just Jeffrey, man.
You remember him.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

How you doing, brother man?
Fine.

Thanks.

Good game.

Scored a goal. I'm here!

I was so close.

If you break one more stool, Rosie's gonna
to make you stand while you're here.

Long night?
[Eric sighs]

Just getting started.
Yeah?

Usual?
Yes, please.




You go buy yourself a drink.


And drinks for the progressive couple
over there doing the smooching.

You're a real gentleman, Eric.

Oh, no, man. It's fine.
You don't have to do that.

Yeah. I know I don't have to.

I want to.




That shirt better come off now.

[clears throat] Um... to, uh, Eric.




Everybody 21?

Yeah.

What about everybody else?

Yeah, man.

Want me to get them?

No.

Fuck it, you're fine. What do want?

Just beer. Four, please.

Just beer?

All right.

These are twist-off.
Y'all should be able to handle that?

Yeah, man. We can handle it.

You know those kids are underage, right?

Whatever. They're harmless.
Let them have their fun.

[indistinct chatter]

Hit me again, please.

Ah! Right, yep. My bad.

Jesus.

I swear, we got more bugs
than people in the bar tonight.

Bugs were fucking on the whiskey.

[Eric] Thank you.
There you go.


[grunts]
There you are.

What's up, brother?

I'm all right, how are you?
Good.

Give me a hug, dude.
Enjoying your last days of freedom?

You know it.
Good. Good.

What's going on?

You fellas, let me know
if you need anything else.

We're good for now, brother.

[Eric] Let's shot some pool!
Pool!

Hey, Mary.
You wanna play?

He's been on a non-stop bender for a week.

He's back on the rig on Monday,
so I think we'll be safe.



Mary, come on. They're only kidding.

[woman 2] Mary, wait.
Kiss my ass, jerk.


You're breaking my heart.
[man] Hey, fellas!

Just be cool, all right?

It's a family establishment.
Sorry, Mom!

Fucking animals.

Hey, what'd I just say?

Well...

You're a dick, Eric.

Whatever, babe.

What happened with Mary?
He was shoving the cue in her face.

Should we get out of here, maybe? Like...

go?

I'm sorry.
Can you get this man a drink, please?

Yes. Yes, I can.

No. No, no. I don't want... I can't...

Technically, it's my job.
I got a deadline. Gotta work. I'm tired.

No, no, no. I have a deadline, so...

Why don't you get wasted and write drunk?

[Jeffrey sighs]

That's what I'd do.
[chuckles]

That doesn't sound like the best advice.

Got my ass through college.

Well, yeah, that was college.

You know he went to Tulane.

Really? That's where I went.
Yeah?

I think I was there a bit
before your time, sonny.

When did you graduate?
The year I dropped out.

[glass shatters]
Whoa!


Now what, bitch?



Eric!



Hey, Eric! Come on, man.

Someone get the bottle
out of that guy's hand!

Will, call the cops.

Motherfucker.

It's the bartender at Rose's.

We've got another fight breaking out.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

You wanna cut me? You wanna cut me?

[screams in pain]


Holy shit.

Fuck!
Jeffrey, stop!

[groaning in pain]

Okay, okay, okay.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

Did you call the cops?

Yeah. Yeah.

Let's go.
Let's go.

You got him.

Dude, what the fuck?
What the fuck? Dude...

[door closes]
You gotta go to the hospital, man.

You call the cops?
Of course, I called.

I shoulda called an ambulance.
Fucking pussy.

Dude, you got...

[coughs]
Let's go.



Let's get outta here.
[Eric] You're fine.

[door closes]

Here you go, man.

You all right?

Just fuck off, dude.

Yeah?

All right. Tell that to the cops
when they get here.

is chicken shit.


What the hell was that?

You're not a tough guy.
You coulda been hurt.

He coulda killed him, I mean...

What else was I supposed to do?
Yeah, okay.

[Will] You did good, kid.
Fuck.

You did good.

Oh, fuck.

It's probably one of the kids'.

Fucked up that they actually filmed
the whole thing.

Fucking millennials.


Anybody need a drink?




Hey, honey.


Guess who's home?

You feel like waking up?

Mm-mm.

Hmm?

Mm-mm.


[soft rustling]

[rustling continues]

[bottle cap clangs]

[phone vibrates]

[rustling continues]

[phone vibrates]

[phone vibrates]


[phone vibrates]

Now stop fucking around.

[phone vibrates]


[food sizzling in pan]

Good morning, pretty little thing.

Well... Oh...

You're going to make me burn the eggs.

Whose phone is that?

Just some chick. She left it at the bar.

So you brought it home?

Just picked it up...

and forgot to leave it there.

There was bit of a fracas
at the bar last night.

Cool.


How's your paper coming?

I'm nearly there.

I just have to go over it again,
and probably rewrite the ending.

Turn it in to Steve and hope he likes it.

I'm sure he will.

He better. It's a quarter of my grade.

Yeah.

What are you gonna do today?

Don't know.

I don't have any plans.

Probably gonna check on Eric
at some point.

Why?

He's the one in the fight last night.

I thought you said it was a girl.

No, there was a group of college kids,
but when the fight started,

they got spooked and took off.

Eric got cut pretty bad, though.
It was brutal.

Well, that's not shocking.

I should probably go check on him.

What are you doing?

Trying to find out whose phone this is.

Why? Should I not look?

Am I gonna see something
I don't want to see?

No.

Why are you asking?

I don't know.

Why do you know how to unlock it?

From the smudge marks on the screen.

I'm not lying about the phone, Carrie.
Okay.

I believe you.

Oh! Fuck!

What?

What's wrong?

Who were you talking to last night?

What do you mean?

You were texting someone.

What is that, Will?


Um...

Don't fuck with it.

Give it to the cops.
Somebody got hurt last night.

Yeah, someone could be fucking
with me, though.

Listen, it's...

Wednesday, so Duane will come in
after his shift. I'll give it to him then.

But what if that girl comes
to get it first?

Just say I don't have it.

Let's let the cops deal with it.

Okay.

Don't worry
your pretty little face about it.

You let your man handle things.

You're gonna make me late.

Yeah, I am.
I have to go.

Mm-mm.
Will...

you truly smell.

God!

for that night,

so I said that we would have
dinner with him.


Dinner with your sober uncle?

What is the problem with that?

So he can fucking judge me the whole time.

[Carrie] What?
[tires screech]

Shit!
God, Will.

Look at these guys.

Fucking here for a higher education,

can't figure out how
to cross a goddamn road.

You know what happens to idiots like that?

You're gonna tell me.
They spend four years here.

Four years becoming an economic prisoner.

He should just go work at Rosie's.

Get a real job.


I don't think he's Rosie's material.

No, he should stay here,

and fucking take lessons
from dillholes like that.

Hey, Steve.

Hi, Steve.

I'm gonna go learn from the dillhole.

Yeah.
See you later.

Love you.


How's it going?

[phone line ringing]


Come have a beer with me.
[Jeffrey] <i>Babe, who are you talking to?</i>


It's like, 10:00 a.m.
What? Are you still sleeping?

<i>Yeah, I didn't get to bed until sunrise.</i>


You're gonna have a beer with me
or not? I'm pulling up to Rosie's.

<i>I'm gonna go back to sleep.</i>

When did you become such a pussy?


<i>You have one for me,
and I'll see you tonight, okay?</i>

All right.
[Alicia chuckles]

[Alicia] <i>Bye.</i>
Bye.

What the fuck?

How's it hanging there, Rosie?

Oh, right and tight, loose, large.
Pick one.

Anyone come in looking for a cell phone?

Nope. Lost and found?

Yeah.

I heard what happened
with Eric last night.

Oh, yeah.

You should stop serving him
when he's fucked up.

He's always fucked up when he's home.

All right.

I can't leave the bar right now.
Can you go check on him?

[bells ringing in the distance]

Holy shit, Eric.

What is it?

You gotta go to the hospital.
I'm calling an ambulance.

No, no, no.
No, fuck that. Dude, your face.

Your face is fucked up!

I can see the inside of your mouth.

It's just swollen. That's all.


I can get a buddy of mine to stitch it up.

A buddy of yours?

Come on, Eric.
You're not in fucking Afghanistan, dude.


They'll ask questions.
[Will] Like what?

You wanna be able to eat food
without it falling out of your face?

[Eric groans]

What?

Nothing.

Thank your friend for me.

What friend?

The one who's banging your girl.

She's not my girl, dude.


Okay.

I just came to check on you.
I'll let you get your rest.

Hey, don't leave.

Nightmares.

Yeah. All right, man.

I'll stay for a little bit.

Hey, man, you got any more beer?

Mm-hmm.

Thank you.

[pops can open]


[clapping in the distance]

Uh, $22.50.

Oh, wait.

Don't forget to buy your girlfriend
something pretty.

He'll love it.

[both laugh]

Ooh! He looks good in them tights.
Yes, he do.


I thought you said you didn't want a beer.

I think I meant that I didn't want
to have a beer for breakfast.

Hmm.

Hey, Will.

Hey, Jeffrey.

You get your little project done?

Yeah. Um... turned it in this morning.

Just chilling now.

That's a gold star for you, then, right?


You hear anything about Eric?
Yeah, I went and saw him this morning.

His face is all cut to shit.

He's refusing to go to the hospital,
because he thinks he's Rambo.

You want to join us?

No.

No, no. I got to go.

I got a bunch of shit to do.
Just came for some to-go.

See you guys.

Hello?

Carrie?

Hmm.

[video game music playing]

[video game sound effects]

[man on video game]
<i>Monorail, up those stairs!</i>

[phone vibrates]

[video game sound effects continue]

[phone vibrates]

[video game] <i>More of these clowns.</i>

Fuck off.

[phone vibrates]

[screaming from video game]

[man's voice]<i> That's amazing, dude.</i>

[woman's voice] <i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I literally can't believe this.</i>


[man's voice]<i> Hey, stop goofing around.</i>

[woman's voice] <i>Shut up.</i>

<i>- You think we did it right?</i>
[man's voice] <i>I don't know.</i>

<i>We did exactly what it said in the book.</i>

[woman's voice]
<i>Oh, my God. Look at the cockroaches.</i>

[man's voice] <i>Fuck.</i>
[woman's voice] <i>Oh, my God!</i>

[man's voice] <i>Fuck!</i>

[indistinct chatter]

[woman screams]


When'd you get home?

Right now?

What are you looking at?

Nothing.

I thought you were
going to bring that to the police.

I am.

I'll take it today.

What were you looking at?

Who's fucking phone is that?

I told you, it's...

some chick from the bar.

One of the chicks from the bar?

I can't believe you're
still going on about this.

So, what?
All my friends just have to be guys?

Is that the deal?

What about Steve?

What about Steve?

You fucking talk about him all the time.

He's my professor.
And he obviously wants to fuck you.

You wanna check my phone?

You wanna go through my texts,
see if I sent him any pictures of my tits?

Go on, look at it.

No.

Go on, check it.
I don't want to.

I don't want to, because I trust you.

I want to trust you.

But you're being all shady
with some cunt's phone,

and you're acting guilty as shit.

Give it to me.

You don't wanna see it.

You don't wanna see it. It's awful.

Go to the last pictures.

Is that... Is this Garrett?

Is this who you were talking to?

I don't think so.

Those pictures were already on the phone.

[sniffles] Call him.
No.

Then I'll call him.
No, it's a bad idea. Don't.

I don't want to think about someone

dying like this,

and you'd ignored him.

I ignored him?

He was begging.

That's bullshit.

No one's dead. This is...

It's obviously some fucking nerd

who's into special effects.

[phone line ringing]

[rustling over phone]

[heavy breathing over phone]

Hello?

[indistinct sound]

Garrett?

[squealing sound]


Ah!


No.

I'm going to call the cops.

Don't.

Listen, don't.
[gasps]

What are you doing?

I'll take it to Duane.

He's a friend. He'll take it seriously.

Do it right now.

Will, do it right now!

[phone vibrates]

[phone vibrates]

Fuck!

[tires screech]
[car horn honks]

[woman 1] Sir, are you okay?

[woman 2] Are you all right?
Want me to call somebody?

[woman 3] What's wrong with him?
The fuck is that?

[man 2] I got your ass right on camera!

I don't see no blood.

[indistinct chatter]

Crazy, man.
Right?

[man 3] That's crazy.

[indistinct chatter]

[car revs engine, tires screech]

Fuck.

Fuck!


'Sup, baby? How you doing?
Just another day. How are you?

Good. Beautiful day out there, right?


[Duane laughs]

What happened last night?
Why didn't you call us?

I did. Took you guys
an hour and a half to respond.

No, man. I don't mean Fifth District.
I mean us.

I didn't know I could do that.

When last time Rosie's been hit
with an underage sting, huh?

Last time anybody followed up
on a noise complaint?

That's our bar, we protect the place.

Yeah, I know.

'Sup, Will?
Hey, dude.

[clears throat] How are you?
Good, man.

Eric all right?

Yeah, he's okay.

I checked on him this morning.
Have a seat.

So...

what about the guy that did this?

I don't know.
I've never seen him before in my life.

Kind of figured it was
just something between them.

I tell you what. You see him, you call us.

I want to talk to him,
see how tough this bitch really is.


There was also
these college kids at the bar,

and they left a cell phone there.

I went through it to see whose it was,

and I found some
really fucked up shit in there.

Like what, exactly?

There was a dead guy.

He looked murdered.

Murdered?
Yeah.

Where's the phone?

I lost it.

You lost it?

Yeah, on the way here.

But I think it was
those college kids, man.

I think they took it.

They've been following me around
in a black Charger.

I know it sounds crazy,
but my girlfriend saw the pictures, too.

I'm telling you guys the truth.

So, uh, you got a license plate
on this black Charger?

Yeah, yeah.

Uh, I think it started with a six.

A six?

Yeah.

That's it?

Yeah.


Okay, Will.

Look, man, if you, uh...

want to make a statement,

just give us all the details,
and we'll see what we can do.

Sure.


I hate when people touch
my shit on my desk.

We going to see you tonight?

Yeah, man. I'll be there. Same as usual.

[grunts]
[laughs]

I put too much heat.


'Sup, bitches.
How's it going?

[Duane] What's up big hair?
How's the main bitch?

What's shakin', bacon?


It's quiet in here tonight.

Yeah, I finally get you all to myself.

Oh, ho, ho.

Speaking of, where's Jeffrey?

Punishing him.

He's being a jealous asshole.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Jealous of who?

None of your business, bartender.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-mm.

I'm just gonna do the one.
I'm trying to take it easy.

Why?

'Cause I don't wanna be wasted.

Then just don't get wasted.

Just do what I do, maintain the buzz.

It's like surfing, only more fun.

I don't think you should be telling me
how to drink.

[glasses clang together]

I need to drink tonight...

and you're here.

So, you just became my backup.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Just got some shit on my brain
I don't want on my brain.

I've also got an eight-ball in my pocket.

If you wanna play.



[Will] Try to talk to it.
Okay.



impressive if you caught it,

'cause you did extra flips.
That's extra brownie points.

Okay, just like easy, like,
"Hey, how you doing? What's up?"

It's been a while.

That's too much.
Yeah, she's playing hard-to-get.

Try a different one.
Okay.

This one's Hubert.
Okay.

He's much nicer. Try. Ready?

Boom!

It's that easy. Really.
It's like, finesse.

Yeah, just like I...


Douglas.

What the fuck are you doing here?
William.

The fuck does it look like?
I fucking work here.

You know that, come on.
It's your shift already?

What time is it?
I don't know.

Y'all drunk, huh?

You're drunk.
Uh-uh. I'm handsome.

You drunk.
[Will] We both are drunk.

He's handsome.

I'll take it. [laughs]

I don't wanna go to sleep yet.

I don't either.

Don't do that.
See. These are scheming fingers.

What are you doing?
Scheme, scheme...

Let's go to The Fly.

Let's kill this thing.


Okay, there you go.

[groans, laughs]

Co-pilot responsibilities.

Oh, fuck.

So much for cutting back.

Well, I guess there's always tomorrow.

That's the point, Will.

I'm almost 30,
and I'm wasting my life away.

No. I don't think you're wasting it.

I think you're living it.

I don't know.

Listen...

you're drinking tonight
because I asked you to drink,

so that's an exception.

You're basically drinking out of sympathy.

You're like a saint.

Canonized.

Is that the word?

Yes.
Deified. No, that makes you a god.

You are a goddess. Let's be honest.

[laughs]
Can a god be a saint?

Hey.
Hmm?

You know if you ever need to talk to me
about anything, I'm here for you.

Yeah.

[bottle cork pops]

[indistinct chatter]

This is so nice.

It is.

There's no people.

I like no people.

God, you smell so good.

[Alicia moans]

Will. Will. Will...

Will, stop!
What? What?

What? What's wrong?


You know what's wrong.

What is it? Jeffrey?

Yeah, of course it's Jeffrey.
Come on, Will.

Yeah, but why?

Why? I don't even understand it.

I don't know. Jesus.

I dunno. It's your girlfriend, too.

Yeah, but...

don't worry about her.

Will, stop.
Come on.

Will, stop it.

Stop it!
Fine.

We should just go.

She doesn't even love me anymore,
you know?

I'm sorry if she doesn't love you anymore.

That's true. I really am sorry.

[car door closes]

[phone ringing]

Hey, sorry I'm late.
I'm on my way. I'll be back in...

[phone line beeps]

[phone beeps]

[car engine starts]

[door closes]

Carrie?

Hello?

Hey.

Carrie.

You okay?

Hi.

What time is it?

What is that?

Nothing.

Did you just get home?

Yeah, I... stayed at the bar,
played a couple games of pool.

Let's go to bed.

Hey...

I found your phone on the floor.

Did you send me a picture?

No.

Maybe, I don't know...

I don't know. I feel foggy.

Are you drunk?

No, Will. I'm just really tired.

Come on. Let's go to bed.

Yeah, uh...

I'll meet you in there.


[scraping sound]


Garrett?

Hey, man. I'm really sorry I didn't help.
I thought you were kidding around.

[Garrett whispers] There was a ritual.

We opened a portal.

Something came and possessed us.

You called it into your home.

Now it sees you are
the perfect vessel for more.

It is in your bedroom right now...

staring at you as you sleep.

[high-pitch pinging]

[breathing heavily]

[breathing heavily]


I told you,
they'd call if they heard anything.

Do they not care?

Of course they care, Carrie.

What was his reaction
when you showed him the pictures?

I don't know.

He was shocked.

I googled that name...

Garrett.

To see if there are any references
on Nola.com

of someone missing or being hurt,
but I didn't find anything.

Because we don't know
if anything happened to him.

I don't understand
how blasÃ© you are about all this.

You didn't even want to bring it
to the cops in the first place.

God.

Fuck this.

People look so normal on the outside.

What are you talking about?

But on the inside, it's all just...

worms.

[door opens and closes]

[mouse clicks]

[man singing
"When the Saints Go Marching In"]

<i>â™ª Oh, when the saints go marching in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, Lord, I want to be in that number â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, when the saints go marching in â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Oh, when the saints... â™ª</i>
For fuck's sake, pipe it down!

<i>- â™ª ...go marching in... â™ª</i>
Shut up!

<i>â™ª Oh, when the saints go marching in... â™ª</i>

Hey, Willard.


<i>â™ª Oh, when the saints go marching in... â™ª</i>

That seat's reserved.

Shut the fuck...

I don't know what to tell you, princess,
but that seat's taken. All right?

<i>â™ª Oh, Lord, I want to be in that number â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, when the saints go marching in... â™ª</i>

Coming right up.

By the way, man, how's Eric?

If one more fucking person
asks me about Eric, I swear to Christ...

Sorry, man.
People have been asking all day.

Any luck with those kids?

The ones with the cell phone?

No, man, sorry. Nothing.

You didn't really give us
much to work with.

Let you know if we find something.

Hey.

Jeffrey.

Where's Alicia?

Hey.

Uh...

Usual?

Just two beers this time.

Okay.

Need anything else, let me know.

Hey, bartender.

Bring me another beer.

I just brought you one, man.

[bottle shatters]

That one's empty.

Doing all right there, Jeffrey?

Hey, I'm good.

Jeffrey...
How the fuck are you, bartender?


Got started early today, huh?

Bartender, why don't you
bring me another beer?

You just got yourself cut off, my man.
Bring me another beer!

Don't take that approach with me, Jeffrey.

Bring me another beer!
You should get him the fuck outta here.

[bottle shatters]
Pick that shit up, bartender.

You're not a tough guy, Jeffrey!
Quit fucking acting like one!

Calm down, Will.
Hey, Alicia! I'll call you later.

Jeffrey! Calm down!
You got a problem?

I thought we were friends!
Yeah, we are friends.

Get over here so I can give you a hug!

What's the matter with you, prick?

Stop it!
Hey, don't talk to him. Talk to me.

I don't want to talk to you.

[door closes]

Hey, was that guy crying?


Yeah, he was,
'cause he's a little fucking bitch.

[breathing heavily]

[door opens]


[high-pitch pinging]

[Willard muffled] Will?


Will!

[phone vibrates]

Another beer?

No.

Bourbon, neat.

I thought you had a stroke or something.

Damn!
Shit!

Watch the bar!

[tires screeching]

<i>This is Carrie.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

Fuck!

[tires screeching]
[car horn honks]

They're fucking in here.

Carrie?

Carrie!

Fuck.

Is anyone else in here?

Carrie.

Hey, Carrie.

Carrie, are you okay?

Hey.

Fuck.

Oh, fuck. Jesus Christ.

Hey.

Is there anybody else in here?

Carrie!


[breathing heavily]

Fuck!

[phone ringing]

[indistinct sound]




Whoa.

[phone clatters]



Hey! Hey! Are you okay?
[coughs]

Don't touch me!

[breathing heavily]

[phone ringing]



Why did you come home?

Do you not remember
anything that happened tonight?

I was looking online for something.
I was doing research.

And then I...

I don't know. It's hard to think.

Was there anyone else here tonight?

I think there was.

Oh, my God. I think there was.

Who?

I don't know.

You sent me a picture of him.

No.

sending you that.

[phone line ringing]

[Doug] <i>Will!</i>
Hey.

Doug.

<i>Yo. What the fuck, man?</i>

<i>Look, are you okay?</i>

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be in tomorrow night.

If I still got a job.

<i>Relax. We got you covered.</i>

<i>Just do what you need to do.</i>

Thanks, man.

<i>It's no problem at all.
That's what friends are for.</i>

All right.

Hey, I appreciate it, man.

Bye.

<i>And your boy Eric called down here, man.</i>

Wait, sorry. What'd you say?

<i>I said Eric called down, asking for you.</i>

<i>I told him you went home early.</i>

What did he want?

<i>I don't know. Said something
about giving you a present.</i>

<i>I gave him your number, though.</i>

<i>Probably a booty call.</i>

[Doug laughs]

<i>Look, I don't judge, brother,
but I knew that's what it is.</i>

All right, gotcha.

[phone line ringing]


<i>You shouldn't call here.</i>

So, you told him, huh?

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, I didn't mean to.</i>

<i>Maybe I did. I don't know.
I thought we could go back to normal.</i>

<i>I was stupid.</i>

Is he there now?

<i>Yeah. He's in the other room.</i>

You sure it's a good idea?

<i>Everything's fine.</i>

<i>Look, I can't talk to you right now.
I have to go, okay?</i>

<i>Goodnight, Will.</i>

[phone disconnects]

What the fuck?

We really need to do something about that.

I think we should break up.

I don't think this is working.

Okay.

That's all you got?

"Okay"?

Why are you acting offended?
You're breaking up with me.

I can't believe how calmly
you're taking this whole thing.

I guess you can probably find
a place to crash

while you look for a new apartment, right?

Already? Today?

What did you expect? That we'd cuddle?

Fuck you.

I'm sorry. [scoffs]

It's just this whole thing with the phone,
and the pictures.

It's dangerous.

And I don't want you anywhere around it.

Really?

Are you a hero now?

Come on, Carrie.

Do you hear yourself?

You're scared.

I'm scared, too.

But I would never abandon you to it.

That's not what I'm saying.

Fuck you.

I wasn't mad until just now.

I was disappointed.

I was hurt.

But now, I'm just fucking pissed.

So, if that's what you wanted,
then, you got it.

It's not what I wanted.

You know what I think you want?

Nothing.

Because there's nothing there to satisfy.

You are a mock person.

You're just a body.

[breathing heavily]

[Carrie sobs]

[Carrie continues sobbing]

You okay?

Fucking Doug say something?

No.

Did something happen?

Nope.

Well, you look like shit.

Have you even showered today?

Hit me again.

I don't think that's a good idea.

Your shift starts soon, anyway.

I'm a grown ass man.

Do I need to worry about you?

Nope.

You really don't, Rosie.

Oh! I'm sorry!
Motherfucker!

I can buy you another drink, man.

I don't want your drink!
Hey!

No problem, man.


Go home.

Take a shower.

Get your head straight.

What about my shift?

Don't worry about it.
I'll cover you for tonight.

I don't want you to.

I don't want you to.

Well...

Fuck you, Rosie.

Excuse me?

Fuck me?

Fuck you.

Do you want to keep this job?

Fuck your job.

[door opens]

[door slams shut]

[phone line ringing]

<i>Hey, it's Alicia. Leave a message.</i>

Alicia, it's me. It's important.

I need you to call me back.

I know you're getting these messages.

Fuck!

[bottle shatters]

[breathing heavily]

[flies buzzing]

[flies buzzing]

Eric.

Christ.

Eric?

[sighs deeply]

Eric?

Eric, you in here, man?

How you living, man?

Did someone break in here?


Just checking on you, man.

I'm good.

I gotta crash here for a few days.

I gotta stay on your couch...

for a day or two.

No.

I'm up against a wall, man.

No!

I'm gonna clean up
around here a little bit.

It'll be good.

Don't worry about it.

[phone line ringing]



Yeah, but that was last night,
when you were with Jeffrey.

Where are you now? Are you okay?

<i>Will, I'm trying to fix my life, okay?</i>

<i>I need you to stop calling me.
It's not helping.</i>

Wait.

I left Carrie.

I broke up with her this morning.
[Alicia sighs]

<i>I'm sorry?</i>

<i>I'm sorry to hear that, Will.</i>

No, that's, that's good news... right?

<i>- I don't know. That's up to you.</i>
Wait, don't. Alicia...

<i>Will, I'm with Jeffrey.</i>

<i>I love Jeffrey. Do you understand that?</i>

No.

No, I don't understand that at all.

<i>I don't know when
we're coming back to the bar.</i>

<i>Maybe not for a while, okay?</i>

<i>Don't call me back.</i>

<i>If you really care about me,
you cannot call me back.</i>

[phone clicks then beeps]

You can't be in here. [breathing heavily]

You hear me?

I don't want you here.

Didn't you call me?

No.

[Eric grunts]

Someone called the bar last night
from this number, looking for me.

If it wasn't you, who the fuck was it?

They made me do it.

Those freaks.

Was it the fucking college kids?

Was it?

They told me to give you a present.

Now get the fuck off me!

I'll kill you.

I'll kill you.

[Eric panting]

[Eric grunts]

[Eric breathing heavily]

What's the present, Eric?

[phone vibrates]

[phone vibrates]

Are you the wrapping?

You can feel it moving around in there.

Can't you?

Please leave.

Shh.

Most people don't know you.

They don't see the evil

and the ugly in your heart.

You have to be dead first...

or will they rip you open
while you're still alive.

I wonder what would happen if I called it.

[indistinct sound]

[Eric groans]

[Eric groaning]



[screaming in pain]

[Eric continues to scream in pain]

[screaming continues]

[Eric screams and coughs]

Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it!

Don't do this.

[Eric groaning in pain]

[screaming in pain]

Fix me.

Make me whole.

[Eric groaning in pain]

[screaming continues]


[ambient music playing]

[music fades out]
