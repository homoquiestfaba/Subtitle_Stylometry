[WOMAN CHANTS WAILINGLY]


What?

Nothing.

It's just, I'm the
luckiest guy in the world.

Yes, you are,
and the cheesiest one, too.

Wow! That's...

I feel very loved
and appreciated right now,

against all the knives
stabbing my broken heart.

Oh, fuck it on a bucket,
here we go again.

Drama, drama, drama.

I love you, okay?

Even though you are cheesier
than a Valentine's Day card.

I love you, too.

Even when you act all cray-cray.

What did you just say?

Did you just say cray-cray?

Yes, cray-cray.
Stop.

Why stop?
Stop, stop, no.

I saw it on TV, it's cool.

People are saying it.
No, it's not cool.

Cray-cray.

You are such a girl.

The parade of compliments continues.
Come on, give me more.

Oh, okay, dork.

I'm your dork, so...
Yes, don't remind me.

Seriously, though,
are you okay with this decision?

What, marrying you?

Well, now that you mention it,
I'm not sure.

Ow, dude, that hurt.
Hey!

What was that one for?

I told you
stop calling me "dude."

[SMACKS LIPS]
Okay.

[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

I'll stop.
Good.

Hey!
Drive, cray-cray.

I am driving,
and you are the cray-cray one.

Cray-cray!
No. [GIGGLES]

You have to stop saying that,
it's never cool.

It's awesome.
No.

Like me, it's awesome!
Oh, yes, like you.

Yup.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

Okay, where are you
hiding the butler?

[BOTH GIGGLE]

How do you know him again?

Harrison?

We've been golf buddies
for the past few months.

And he worked with you?

No, he's not a lawyer,
he owns his own business.

Something with shipping,
exchange, and collateral.

Well, he has taste,
I'll give him that.

Very expensive taste.

He always dresses in
designer this, designer that,

with a $200 haircut,
smelling all GQ cool.

And he has this untouchable
way of carrying himself.

Untouchable?

Mm-hmm.

Maybe a little too intense
and too confident for some.

But not for you.
Come on, really?

If I was to fear
confidence and intensity,

we wouldn't be getting
married in two days, would we?

I don't know,
I always thought it was my

amazing personality and my
perfectly shaped intelligence

that made you propose.

Baby, baby, I equally love both,
your personality and your ass.

Correction. I'm sorry,
I mean, your intelligence.

People should make even cast
molds of it, and even post it

in the dictionary next to--
What'd you say?

Post it.
Post it?

Next to the words
naughty and perfection.

Oh, the defense rests,
Your Honor.

Are you sure?

Because I was really looking
forward to holding you

in contempt and punishing
you a little bit.

Contempt.

Contempt, contempt!

Who needs contempt,
Your Honor?

Foreplay is just for
overcompensating teenagers.

Punish me.

I'm overdue some punishment.

Overdue.

We just punished each
other before we left,

and I thought it was
a great punishment.

I know I felt punished.
Didn't you?

[CELLPHONE RINGING]

Speak of the devil,
it's Harrison.

Oh, he's FaceTiming me.

Oh, exciting,
ask him to beam you up.

Hey, man, is this your way
to show me we have WiFi here?


You know what they say,
"Why bother entering

if you don't make an entrance,"
right?

Do you like?
Like? I love it.

Plus, you managed to impress Kira, and
trust me, that's not an easy thing to do.

Oh, good, good.

Well, you two just enjoy,
and relax this weekend, okay?

Okay, cool. Thanks, man.
Oh, you want to see Kira?

No, Marco, this is not the
proper way to meet someone.

I'll see her Sunday
at the wedding.

You two just relax
and enjoy the weekend.

Make it a night in,
if you know what I mean, huh?

See you soon, buddy.

Cheers.
Cheers.

This guy, he is so fucking cool.

He is like, Bruce Wayne
and Gordon Gekko in one.

Wow, okay then, do you want
me to give you some time alone

and get your
bromance fantasy on?

Maybe some lotion?

[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

The guy gave us this kick ass
cabin for the weekend.

Can I at least give him
a compliment or two?

Baby, as long as that's all
you give him, I'm all good.

You are impossible,
you know that, right?

Unredeemable.

Let's finish
unpacking the car, okay.


I vow, to love you
beyond the rim of this earth,

to fight for every moment
of happiness together.

You are the air,

I want to breathe
for the rest of my life.

And teasing you or not,
I'd love nothing more

than to be your bride.

[MARCO GRUMBLING]

Crazy boy.

Why are you so mean?

You told me to wake you
up at 10:00, it's 10:27.

Five more minutes?

You said five minutes,
20 minutes ago.

Come on, get up.

Up, up, up, up.

No.
Such a baby.

Come on,
I'll make you breakfast.

What?

Well, get up and you'll see.

Again, I told you I don't mind
your stinking morning breath.

Hey, you don't have to be
an ass about it.

An ass? An ass.

[KIRA GIGGLING]

Okay, hello!


Good morning.

Are you ever coming back?

At least light up a match, okay?

Hold your horses, I'm coming.

You really just can't help it,
can you?

For your information,
Miss Smart Ass, I took a while,

to wrap this for you.

It's pink.

[GIGGLES SOFTLY]

Just open it.

What is it?
Open it and you'll see.

I know they are not your dad's,
but I also know how much

you hated losing them
and how safe they made you feel

close to your heart.

"Fuck it on the bucket."

I wanted to actually get you
something that you would wear.

"You are the air I want to breathe
for the rest of my life."

"In our future together."

So, do you like it?

I love it!

Try to... try to avoid
getting too romantic.

This is romantic.

It shows how well you know me.

It's me, it's us.

And tomorrow,
I'll become Mrs. Cheesy Man.

I couldn't be happier.

Well, that makes two of us.


What?
Now, my turn.

No, no, no, I liked where
that was going, come on.

The kissing thing and stuff.

Stay here,
or I'll break your legs.

What?
You know that even with a smile,

it's still
very emasculating, right.

So sad.

Close your eyes.
Okay.

And keep them closed.

They are.

Okay, open.

Baby, isn't it bad luck to see
the bride before the wedding?

Not if I strip it off, slowly.

Don't you think?
I do, I solemnly do.

Because it's like food and
the three second rule, right?

It doesn't really count
if it's taken care of fast.

Shh!

Something borrowed.

Something blue.

[GLASS BREAKING]

Babe, did you hear that?

Stay right here.

I'll come, too.
No, no! I said you stay here.


Marco?

Polo!

[GUN CLICKING]

Put the gun down. Please.

This isn't as bad as it looks.

Everything is under control, so let's
not escalate things beyond repairing.

Bitch, put the fucking gun down!

I'll put an air hole
in your hubby's chest. You hear?

What the fuck you doing, man?

Shut the fuck up!

Look, we are not here
to kill you, or him.

I can promise you that.

But, if you don't
put that gun down,

my drunk friend over there is gonna put
a bullet right in your husband's head.

Drunk friend, man?
It's my fucking b-day, man!

I can drink as much as I want!

Don't you put this
shit on me, man.

Shut your fat fucking hole!

Learn your place, or I'll dig one
and put you in it. Understood?

Listen. There is no
easy way to say this.

This is kidnapping, which means
we're gonna gonna take you

away from your boy there,
for a little camping trip.

The length of which is determined
solely by how much he loves you.

Listen, there is
no need for kidnapping.

I'll do it now, I'll do it right now.
Just tell me how much.

I'm not the one
dictating numbers,

nor is this a business that
can be resolved with checks.

No checks, I swear.

Just tell me how much,
give me a few hours,

I'll have someone here
with the cash, I swear.

What do you want dollars, Euros?
You name it.

Euros, we're fucking
Americans, man.

We don't take your pansy
ass colored monopoly money.

Marco, save your breath.

These are foot soldiers.

Like I said,
I don't dictate terms.

I just execute them.

If you two care to stay alive,

I will advise you
to put your guns down,

let Marco come to me,
and I'll let you go free.

I'll even let you pick up your
unconscious buddy downstairs.

Lee? Lee, where the fuck
are you, man?

She knocked him out, boy.

She's not lying.
No, sir, not this one.

What's your training?
Where did you serve?

[BULLETS FIRING]

What the fuck happened, man?

You said this was supposed to be
an easy scare and grab,

and some how we got fucking Jason
Bourne in a wedding dress on our hands?

How the fuck we gonna
explain this to the boss?

Relax.

Relax? Relax.

Fatty here just
killed our money man.

How the fuck do you
want me to relax?

Listen, from one soldier
to another,

if the boss finds out,
he is gonna kill us.

Listen you idiot, I'm sick
and tired of wannabes like you

who think that just because they
can hunt boar and fucking ducks

that they got what it takes
to be a solider.

Don't you ever
call yourself a solider

or compare yourself with one.
You got it?

Good, now instead of...
why aren't you out chasing her?

Or I'll fucking kill you myself!
Go!

She was here.

This way.

Earl, are you sure? She went to
that end of the forest, man.

What the fuck are
you babbling about?

She went into that
side of the forest.

You know the story.
That story is for fucking kids.

Man up and get a move on. Go!


[MAN HOOTS]


Nice shooting, bitch.

[GUN CLICKS]


[BIRDS CHIRPING]

Damn, she got you again, Lee?

Move away, Bobby Joe,
this fucking bitch is mine.

No, I got this, I got this.

Today is my birthday
you fucking bitch,

and this is not
how I planned it, hell no.

I'm supposed to be drinking
some cheap beer

and trying to fuck anything
I can find for a 20.

But, no, you had to get all Jason Bourne
on our ass and complicate this...

...complicated thingy
we got going on right here.

So it's settled then.
Step back.

Lee! I said,
step the fuck back.

Why?

The deal is dead,
the money is gone.

This bitch is just
collateral damage.

He's right man.
She's no use to us no more.

This skank gotta go.

Besides, look at us, man,
I'm shot in my fucking shoulder,

you're missing half of a ear.
Lee over here got knocked

the fuck out twice
in a fucking hour.

On top of it all that,
it's my fucking birthday, man.

Exactly.

It's his birthday.

I already gave him a present,

but give me that
Desert Eagle of yours

and I'd happy to give
him another one.

Straight through his
fat fucking heart.

How's this for a present?


[BONE CRACKING]

And it's an average size heart.

You got spunk lady,
I'll give you that.

But at the end of the day,
you caused a lot of ruckus.

Hell, you cost me half an ear.

But most importantly,
you cost us all 30 G.

But it's okay.

It's okay, because now
you're gonna make it up to us.

Mm-hmm.
Hey, Bobby Joe,

how would you like some fancy
caviar pussy for your birthday?

Hell, yeah!
Now you're talking!

Fuck!

Damn!


I'll teach you how to use
that fucking head, you bitch.

Fuck!

Put that limp dick anywhere near
my mouth and I'll bite it off.

She might.

You better go for
the safe hole, Earl.

Yeah, you're right, besides,
I'm more of an ass man.

Choke that.


Ricky, get over here
and grab her hand.

We gotta get out of here, man.

We gotta leave before
we wake her up.

We are right next to
the fucking blood tree!

Hey, retard, enough with all this
fucking voodoo mumbo-jumbo shit.

Get over there
and grab her hands.

Listen fuck-head,
it's obvious that hot pussy

is not your game, so why don't you
get your fag ass out of here?

We'll see you later!

We need to get out of
here before it's too late!

Get back to the fucking camp!

Can one of you
grab this bitch's hand?

[KIRA GURGLING]

Fuck.


That ought to hold her.

Look at that ass.

Townie whores.

Sure know how to
get my chubby up fast.

Bobby Joe.

Happy Birthday!

Why, thank you,
my kind sir!

[BOBBY JOE] Hey, share the
fucking wealth, motherfucker!

Alright, but I'm going
after Earl,

'cause, I always get 'em
dead or fuckin' passed out

by the time you idiots
are done with them.

Fine, but count that as
my treat for your birthday.

Plus, the wetter
the better, I say.

[WINCING IN PAIN]

Yeah, I'm good with that, buddy.

[EARL GROANING]

[WOUND SQUISHING]

All yours, boys.

Sorry, darling, unlike Earl,
I'm a traditionalist,

I like it missionary.

Look at this picture, Lee,
scary redneck with a shotgun,

half passed out bitch
in a wedding dress.

What do you get? Boom!


Take that.


Oh, I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

A gentleman always
offers the lady a drink.


Calm down, I just wanna make
sure you are still breathing.

Oh, yeah.

Earl got you nice and loose.

This is for shooting
my fucking arm!


This is for ruining
my fucking birthday!

And this is for my birthday.


Oh, fuck.

I do gotta lose weight.

She is all yours, man.

[HEAVY BREATHING]

That was some nice
and tight pussy, boys.

The bitch put up a fight
but, damn, she was fuckable.

Okay, all right, simmer down
and talk damage control.

Let's.
I'm all ears.

No pun intended, Earl.

What Ear-l? I only heard
half of what you said.

Shut the fuck up dummy.
We go back to the cabin,

we get the dead guy,
grab all their shit,

bring it back here,
dig a nice deep hole,

and bury them next
to that big ass tree.

Shit, she's still breathing.
Round two.

Go, go.
Go back to the cabin.

Clean it up,
bring shovels too, go.

Damn.

You don't give up do you?

Like I said,
you have spunk like no other.

[GUN FIRES]

Just put Napoleon
down over there and shit.

[HACKING AND SPITTING]

That bitch is fucked up, man.

She's done.

The hole in the
head give it away?

Yeah, it did.

It was a fucking
rhetorical question, dummy.

Just grab some fucking
shovels and start digging.

Ah...

Before anything, and not
to be the greedy one here,

but what about
our fucking money?

More importantly, what the fuck
are we gonna tell the boss?

The boss... The boss, of course,
is gonna ask what happened?

And we're gonna tell 'em,
what we'd tell anybody asking.

"This never happened."

"They never showed."

"We did our job, we moved in,
the cabin was empty."

Clean story, easy out.

We're clear?

Yeah, we're clear, but what
about my fucking vagina arm

and your ear bleeding
like it's on its period, man?

Well, he sees us as a bunch of
dirty no good rednecks anyway.

Why disappoint?


As far as money goes,
I reckon we still make bank.

We call on to Dale in the morning and
sell that SUV, for what Bobby Joe?

Shiny thing over there
with the new car smell?

Twenty.

Keep everything
that comes from the SUV.

With Ricky chickening outta the job, I
don't give a shit if he gets a share.

Deal?

You're the man with the plan.

Good.

Let's grab some shovels
and bury all this shit.

Hell yeah.

What the fuck
is wrong with you?

You don't go in there.

It's enough that all you blabbed
about today was this voodoo shit.

Why is it so hard
for you to believe me?

Why is so hard for any
of you to believe me?

To fear a fucking tree?

Is that what you want us to do?

It's not just the tree, man,
it's the fucking curse!

We all gonna fucking die!

Again with this fucking curse,
you dumb moron!

We should've left you at that truck
stop to fuck your way to a meal.

Lee, step back.

Let the kid be.

No, listen, it's because
of little shits like him

that this country ended up
being run by blacks, Jews, gays!

Don't fucking start this again.

Come on, man,
enough with the gay shit,

I happen to like Elton John.
His music soothes me.

You shut the fuck up!

Listen, it's our fault!

It's our fault that those
fuckers are running the country,

and you wanna know why?

You wanna know why?!

It's because our new generation
of white men are too busy being

afraid of a fucking tree!

All they wanna do is be vampire
motherfuckers and slap their

photos on FaceWeb pages
and YouTunes.

It's YouTube.
What?

Fucking YouTube, man,
you never been on YouTube?

It's cool, man, they got these videos
with this kitty cats playing piano,

that fucking squirrel
on water skis,

gets me every time,
he's like a human,

and he looks at you
and smiles.

You gotta be fucking
kidding me right now.

You... You don't get a cut
out of this deal.

Understood?

That's fine, I don't
want any of it anyway.


God, it's humid out here.

How do you people deal with it?

Ah, I like to use a little
lotion with aloe vera,

maybe like a little,
one of those tiny fans.

What are those,
loafers you are wearing?

Uh, yes, sir,
they're comfortable,

I love the color,
it blends in with the forest,

I can kick you
and you don't see my foot.

You should get some.

Right, and all this time
I thought Earl

was the brain in the group.

Anyway, enough dumb chit-chat.

I'm excited!
Are you excited?

Because I am, I feel like a
fucking kid on Christmas morning

who knows exactly
what he is gonna get.

So...

Where is my package?

Is it in there?

You know, when I was a kid,

I used to always throw a fit
whenever I didn't get what I wanted.

Used to drive my parent nuts.

But now you know the difference?

Well, I still throw a fit,
but these days I can do it

much more convincingly...

[GUN COCKS]
With a gun.

They never showed.

Excuse me?

The marks, they never
showed up at the cabin.

Really?

I see.

You're sure?

A hundred percent.
A hundred percent, well.

That's pretty
damn sure now, isn't it?

Sure enough to raise
your right hand

and swear on your
dear God, Jesus?

Really?

Sit your big ass down.

Who the fuck do
you think I am, huh?

One of your inbred,
retarded relatives here?

You think I just
do this shit on the fly?

Like I learned about this
business from some online course

or a fucking YouTube video.

[BOBBY JOE] I told you.
What was that?

Nothing, sir,
I think YouTube is cool.

Shut the fuck up.

I'm a professional
with an IQ higher

than all of yours combined.

Did you really think
that I wouldn't notice that

silk ribbon around your belt?

Or Dummy McPhee over here
with her garter belt wrapped

around his ham-hock
like a fucking trophy, huh?

You shot my fucking hand!

Three time champion of
Harvard's Gun Club, you moron.

So, if I were you,
I'd be very careful

how I choose my next answer.

So lets try this again,
shall we?

Where... is... my... package?

In the forest.

You left them in the forest?

No. We buried them
in the forest.

The job was simple,

rough up Marco a bit
and kidnap Kira.

Rough up Marco, kidnap Kira.

This was always a kidnapping
job, not a kill and bury job.

Am I right?


Ambushed?

By whom exactly?

By her, sir.

You're trying to tell me
that the four of you,

armed to the teeth,
broke into the cabin,

and got ambushed
by an unarmed woman?

She wasn't unarmed.

After she knocked me
unconscious, she took my gun.


Is this some kind of a joke?

There's a camera
somewhere around here.

Am I being Punk'd?
Is that it?

She is a fucking nurse!

Then she was a
fucking nurse from hell,

'cause that bitch can
fight and shoot like a pro.

Sort of training
was pure military.

He's... He's right, sir.
She shot me in the arm,

got him in the ear,

knocked Lee out twice on his ass
right before we put her down.

And Marco?

I shot him, sir.

I shot him by mistake.

My shotgun went off when
the bride lady charged in,

and... and he's dead.
And I'm sorry.

It was only me,
it was none of them.

But...

I also think is a part
of Aiyana's Curse, sir.

Part of what-who-what?

Aiyana's curse.

About 150 years ago,
our Federal troops

stormed an Indian wedding.

[BULLETS FIRING]

Really?

Sit your big ass down.

Today, gentlemen, your incompetence
has cost me a lot of money.

These people
that you killed and buried

were very much in love.

And love, now that's the
true currency of my business.

The more love they have,
the more money I make.

Marco would've paid
whatever to get Kira back.

Maybe even a million.

But now we'll never know,
will we? Will we?

I'm considering burying
our partnership right now.

You still need us.

Debatable.
Really?

Who's gonna take care of
that package over there? You?

The country is in recession
boys and unemployment is high,

ergo I don't think that
new employees will be

difficult to acquire.

Maybe.

Let's say you
lost money in that deal. True.

But I'm kind of a "glass is
half full" type of guy.

And the way I see it,
just bump up the numbers

on this last package
and make up for it.

It's not the same,
but it's not nothing either.

Glass half full, huh?
Yeah.

Look, I prefer to live
with a busted up right hand

than be buried with a good one.

Smart.

Funny, huh?

All right.

We'll continue this little
endeavor of ours,

but no more screw ups.

First things first,
we're gonna have to

clean up this... mess you made.

How far from here
did you bury them?

Under the Blood Tree.
Under the what?

The...

Oh, part of that curse that dead
Junior over here was talking about?

Yeah, the kid's crazy,
he had a fucked up imagination.

Watched too much Harry Potter.

Bobby Joe is right, sir, it's
nothing but an old scary story

from when we were kids
to prevent us from

wandering deep in the woods.

It doesn't matter,
let's just get going.

I'm starting to get quite excited
to see this legendary Blood Tree.

[SPEAKS INDISTINCT]

What's this?

"Fuck it on a bucket?"

Cute.

"You are the air I want to breathe
for the rest of my life."

I knew it.

I could've made
a million off of this.

A million. Come on.

All right, let's go.

Let my spirit
and the love you care

be the life force that drives
you to the ends of your revenge.






Fuck, man.

I knew we should've
dug a deeper hole.

You think the hole
is the problem?

The kid was right.

Jesus, fuck. Not you, too.

You're incompetent,
get over it.

Stop blaming a fairy tale.

I'm not fucking incompetent.

I shot her, point blank,
in the head. Bitch was dead.

Trust me.
Trust you?

I'm done trusting.

You fucked up,
and she's still alive,

now she's gone.

You realize what kind of damage
she can cause me and my business?

We'll find her.
You bet your ass we will,

because your stupidity
has made this my problem.

Look, she doesn't
know her way around,

okay, she's probably headed
back to the cabin right now.

We'll split up.

You dig up Marco, put him in
the back of the car with Ricky,

then meet us back at the camp.

I want you to go to the cabin,
and if you find her there,

I want you to shoot
her dead on the spot

and bring me her fucking head.

You think you can do that?

I'll shove a fucking stick of
dynamite up her ass if needed.

Okay, a little intense,
but I like it.

I like your enthusiasm.

You do it and I'll double
your fee, cash in hand.

Cash in hand.

$20K in your
pocket by morning.

And that goes to any of
you that bring her to me,

preferably dead this time.

What you want me to do?
Wipe the camp clean.

Pick up all the burn
phones and scramblers.

We gotta go move
the other packages, now.

Let's get it done!

â™ª Something borrowed â™ª

Who's there?

â™ª Something blue â™ª

â™ª Something old â™ª

â™ª And something new â™ª

â™ª Don't let the bride
catch up with you â™ª

[KIRA LAUGHING]

Is that you, bitch?

Show yourself.

â™ª Something borrowed â™ª

[BRANCHES CRACKING]

â™ª Something blue â™ª

â™ª Something old â™ª

â™ª And something new â™ª

â™ª Don't let the bride
catch up with you â™ª

Where are you?

Here.




Calm down, I just wanna make
sure you're still breathing.

Something borrowed.

â™ª Something borrowed â™ª

â™ª Something blue â™ª

â™ª Something old â™ª

â™ª And something new â™ª

â™ª Don't let the bride
catch up with you â™ª

[GASPING]
[SKIN REGENERATING]


Hell, yeah!
That's right, bitch.

You don't fucking mess with
me and get away with it.

Curse, my ass.

[PHONE DIALING]

[LINE RINGING]

[HARRISON] Yes?
Boss?

So do you have her?

Hell, yeah, boss!
The bitch is dead.

I shot her through
her fucking kidney

and stabbed her
with my sweet machete.

So where is she now?

Now she's hanging from the tree

like a piece of
no good game meat.

So, am I good or am I good?

Well, congratulations, sir.

You're now $20,000 richer.

Now I want you to bring
her body here to the camp.

Okay?
So, yeah, will do.

You want me to take a picture?
Don't be an idiot.

Boss? Boss...

[MOANING IN PAIN]

[GAGGING ON BLOOD]



Something blue.


[BLOOD SQUIRTING]

[MOANING IN PAIN]

[PHONE RINGING]

So, is that bitch dead or not?

Not.

Well... hello, Kira.

How's Marco?


Look, why don't you
tell me what you want.

What can I do for you
that we can put

all of this
unpleasantness behind us?

How about money?

Not interested.

Then what the fuck do you want?

I want...

...things to go back to
the way they used to be.

I want to see his
face in the morning,

kissing me through the sheets

so we don't smell
our morning breath.

I want to laugh
at his unfunny jokes,

one... more... time.


I want to feel his
fingers through my hair...

...when I go to sleep.

I want...

...to be his bride.

But you took
all that away from me.

You left me with nothing.

...nothing but rage...

...and insanity.

When you killed Marco,
you ripped my heart out.

So stay put.

I'm coming to return the favor.

Fuck!

[PHONE RINGING]

Yes?

So Mr. "I'm not incompetent,
I shot her in the head."

That bitch is very much alive.

So listen to me.

I'll give you $100,000 cash

the moment
you bring me her body.

You understand?

Do we have a deal?

What happened
with Lee and Bobby Joe?

She probably
killed them already, okay.

But they're not you.

They don't have your composure,

they don't have your training,
your demeanor.

One-fifty.


I'll do it, but for 150,000.

When I bring her to you,
we're done.

Do we have a deal?

Fine,
you just bring me her body,

a few minutes ago she picked up
Lee's phone. - â™ª Something borrowed â™ª

She's gotta be
somewhere in the area.

I don't need that info.
You don't need that info?

What are you gonna do,
track her scent to find her?

She found me.

Looks like you've been busy.

You know, I was right...

[UNZIPPING]
[METAL CLINKING]

...you do have a lot of spunk.

But somebody's gotta
put you in the ground,

for good this time.
And that's you?

I just got 150,000
reasons to make it so.

You have something
that belongs to me.

What, this old thing?

That...

...and your scalp.

I'm still...
not gonna fucking beg.

I don't care.

From what I recall,

you said you were
more of an ass man.


Something old.

[PHONE RINGING]

Damn it.

[MUFFLED SCREAMING]



[PHONE RINGING]

Shut up, shut up!


Hi, it's me.

Look, I got myself
in a little pinch here,

and I could use your advice.


Well, I still have one package
stocked and ready for payment,

but the shit just hit the fan,

and I feel the heat
is just around the corner.

What should I do?

Well, burn package.

Burn the package?
[GIRL SCREAMING]

But what about the money?

You burn the package,

you live like before,
worry free.

Keep package,
yes, you make money,

but you make 25-to-life, too.

So burn package.

Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

Of course it makes sense.

Now, don't bother me with
business on weekend, yes?

Of course, yes, sir, sorry.

Good, now go take
care of business.

Okay.

[MUFFLED PLEADING]

Okay, burn the package.


That's it?

That was your big entrance?

You missed.


Now didn't you say something
about repaying a favor?

Hmm?

Who? You?

What was that?

I'm sorry, I couldn't understand
you from all the blood

gushing out of your mouth.


Say hello to Marco for me.


Relax, relax, nobody's getting
burned alive today, okay.

[GASPING FOR AIR]

Fuck it on the bucket.


[BONES SNAPPING]

[GURGLING UP BLOOD]

Something new.

"You are the air I want to breathe
for the rest of my life."

[MUFFLED CRIES]

Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you for saving me.

Miss, thank you!

Wait.

Thank you.

Don't you wanna wait with me?

We can take his phone,
we can call the cops.

We can go home!

Miss, you really need a doctor.

Where are you going?

I'm going home, too.


Thank you.

â™ª Something blue â™ª

â™ª Something old â™ª

â™ª And something new â™ª

â™ª Don't let the bride
catch up with you â™ª
