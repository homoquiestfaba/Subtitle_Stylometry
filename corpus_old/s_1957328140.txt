HOW â€™BOUT THE UGLY, FAT, DUMB CHICK

THAT HE CHEATED ON HER WITH LAST SEMESTER?

COME ON, KARINA...

SHE WASNâ€™T THAT FAT.

IS THIS THING ON, HUH?

THAT WAS A JOKE.

LOOK, KARINA, I KNOW I MADE A BIG MISTAKE,

I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT... Iâ€™M SORRY.

YOU KNOW I GIVE AN EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE

END-OF-FINALS PARTY EVERY SEMESTER,

AND I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO COME.

I DONâ€™T THINK ITâ€™S A GOOD IDEA.

HEY, BRANDON. - DONâ€™T "HEY, BRANDON" HIM.

I OUGHT TO BASIC INSTINCT YOUR ASS.

WHATâ€™D I EVER DO TO YOU?

YOUâ€™RE LUCKY YOU AINâ€™T DO SHIT TO ME,

â€™CAUSE I WOULD BASIC INSTINCT YOUR ASS.

[feigns laughter] SO, KARINA, COME ON.

WHATâ€™S IT GONNA BE? - I DONâ€™T KNOW, BRANDON. I--

UH-UH. WHAT IS WHAT GONNA BE?

BRANDON IS TRYING TO GET ME TO GO TO HIS PARTY TONIGHT.

OH, REALLY? MM-HMM.

WHATâ€™S UP, TWO-TIMER?

HEARD YOU LIKE TO LIVE A DOUBLE LIFE, SON.

GOT A LITTLE DOWN, HUH, KID?

[women and Shawn laugh]

HE KNOWS KARATE?

I OUGHT TO BUST YOUR ASS, HOMEY.

[snickering]

MAN, YOUâ€™RE NOT GONNA BUST A GRAPE.

ME, ON THE OTHER HAND-- I USED TO BEAT UP FOOLS FOR FUN,

AND Iâ€™M FEELING LIKE I NEED TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF.

OH, MARCUS, THEREâ€™LL BE ENTERTAINMENT...

AT BRANDONâ€™S PARTY, RIGHT, BRANDON?

[mouths words] - OH, YOU HAVING A PARTY, HOMEY?

YEAH, BUT ITâ€™S KIND OF, YOU KNOW, EXCLUSIVE.

SO WHAT? WE CANâ€™T COME?

SORRY, FELLAS.

IF I GO, THE CREW GOES.

IF SHE GOES, THE CREW GOES.

SO BE READY ABOUT WHAT? 5:00?

5:00-ISH SOUNDS COOL. THANKS, MAN.

KARINA, MAKE SURE "THE CREW" IS READY,

OR THEYâ€™LL BE PLAYING GRAB ASS IN THE DORM TONIGHT.

[clicks tongue]

LITTLE PUNK ASS.

STRETCH YOUR HAND UP LIKE THAT.

HE IS PRETTY CUTE. - YEAH.

10-0-30, WOULD YOU ASK Z-1-10 TO MONITOR

WHEN HEâ€™S AVAILABLE?

CAN YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE?

HOLD ON A SECOND. Iâ€™M GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

DAMN IT, CRITON, MY OFFICE HAS A DOOR ON IT FOR A REASON.

DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

[man screams] [metal clangs]

JOHN, ITâ€™S BEEN TEN YEARS.

AS FAR AS Iâ€™M CONCERNED, THE WHALEY CASE IS OVER.

I SUGGEST YOU LEAVE IT.

COME ON, DAVID.

THEREâ€™S A CONNECTION. I KNOW YOU CAN SEE THAT.

WHAT I SEE IS THE MISTAKE THAT I MADE

WHEN I SENT A SUIT OVER TO THE WHALEY HOUSE TEN YEARS AGO.

SAME KIND OF WEAPON.

SAME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE GUY GOT A CALL JUST BEFORE HE DIED.

JOHN, THE WHALEY CASE IS ONE OF MANY UNSOLVED MURDERS--

ITâ€™S NOT THE FIRST, AND IT DEFINITELY WONâ€™T BE THE LAST.

LET ME DIG A LITTLE.

DONâ€™T WASTE MY TIME WITH UNSOLVED MURDERS

FROM TEN YEARS AGO

WHEN Iâ€™VE GOT THE PRESS DIGGING DOWN MY THROAT

OVER BODIES THAT ARE TURNING UP IN THE STREET TODAY.


Iâ€™D LIKE TO SOLVE THIS CASE...

BUT I CANâ€™T.

AND JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

I THINK I GOT A 4.0 AGAIN THIS SEMESTER,

SO IT WAS WORTH IT.

WOW, THATâ€™S REALLY GREAT.

OKAY, SO JODY JUST GOT AN A-PLUS IN CHEMISTRY.

â™ª THATâ€™S RIGHT, UH-HUH â™ª

â™ª A-PLUS, THATâ€™S RIGHT, THATâ€™S RIGHT â™ª

ALL THE TIME YOU SPENT AT PROFESSOR GORDONâ€™S OFFICE,

YOU SHOULD GET MORE THAN THAT.


Iâ€™M HIS AIDE, SHAWN.

YEAH, AND I JUST GOT SIGNED TO G-G-G-G-UNIT.

[eerie music]

â™ª

OH, YEAH, AND Iâ€™M SURE HE APPRECIATES IT

WHEN YOU LIGHTEN HIS LOAD.

[laughs]

Iâ€™M GOING TO THE BATHROOM. - MM-HMM.

[indistinct chatter]

YOU WANT ALWAYS EVERYTHING, GIRL.

I WANT EVERYTHING ALWAYS.

BOO. - OH!

KAREEM! DONâ€™T DO THAT.

DO WHAT? KISS YOU, BABY, HMM?

SNEAK UP ON ME LIKE SOME DAMN STALKER.

AS LONG AS YOU DONâ€™T PLAN ON LEAVING ME,

YOUâ€™RE FINE, â€™CAUSE WE GONNA GO TOGETHER.

OR WE GONNA GO TOGETHER.

[laughs] BABY, YOU CRAZY.

[headphone music playing faintly]

[singing indistinctly]

[door taps softly]

[door clicks shut]

YO...

WHAT YOU DOING IN HERE, MAN, CHANGING YOUR PAD?

HOLD ON, SON, AND LET A BROTHER PEE IN PEACE.


[urinal flushes]

MAN, IS EVERYBODY WAITING IN THE CAR?

YEAH. GONNA WASH YOUR HANDS? - NO.

EW. NASTY.

DO YOU THINK HE DESERVES ANOTHER CHANCE?

[sighs] GIRL, ONCE A CHEAT, ALWAYS A CHEAT.

WELL, I THINK IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEONE,

YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FORGIVE THEM.

FORGIVE, MAYBE. FORGET, NEVER.

WHOO!

â™ª BOYS, YOU KNOW YOU LIKE...

[humming] â™ª PARTY, PARTY, PARTY

â™ª BOYS, BOYS, BOYS

HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT YOUâ€™RE GONNA WEAR, KAREEM?

â€™CAUSE CHECK THIS FABULOUS BELT.

RELAX. - LOOK AT ALL OF US.

GO, GO, GO, GO.

OKAY. - HURRY UP.

COME ON, MAN. DONâ€™T START THAT BULLSHIT.

NAH, THAT AINâ€™T IT. THAT AINâ€™T IT.

HOLD UP. HOLD UP. - GRAB MY MP3 PLAYER.

AND GET SOME TOILET PAPER.

[horn honks]

[indistinctly yelling]

HURRY UP.

MAN, LETâ€™S GO.

[all cheering]

LETâ€™S GO.

[engine turns]

[rock music playing]

HEY, PARTNER. - CLOSE THE DOOR.

WHATâ€™S UP? - TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS.

[metal clangs]

[screams]

COME ON, JOHN.

I PIECED TOGETHER EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION I COULD FIND.

YOUâ€™VE BEEN CONDUCTING YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION?

AND WHAT DID THE CHIEF HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

I CAN USE AN EXTRA HAND.

THE WHALEY KIDS-- WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY ARE NOW?

ALL OVER.

SOME WERE PLACED WITH RELATIVES.

OTHERS BOUNCED AROUND FOSTER HOMES.

ANY NAME CHANGES?

YEAH.

MOST OF THEM ARE LEGALLY ADOPTED.

ALL RIGHT, LETâ€™S GO LOOK FOR THOSE RECORDS,

BUT THATâ€™S AS FAR AS I GO.

[upbeat pop music playing]

â™ª

CAN YOU PULL OVER SOMEWHERE? Iâ€™VE GOT TO PEE.

PLEASE.

GUYS, ARE THOSE SHEEP?

[sheep baaing]

LETâ€™S HURRY THIS UP AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

HELLO? IS ANYBODY HOME?

I BET YOU IF WE START STEALING SOME OF THEIR SHIT,

[girls chuckle]

THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT.

Iâ€™M FITTINâ€™ WAIT IN THE CAR.

[door bangs]

ding, ding, ding!

[yelps] - STOP RINGING MY DAMN BELL.

NOW WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

MY FRIEND HAS TO USE THE RESTROOM.

AND YOU WANT THE KEYS.

PLEASE.

EW. - WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

THANK YOU. - BUT NO, THANK YOU.

Iâ€™LL WAIT. - SUIT YOURSELF.

NOT ANOTHER FOR MILES.

HAVE FUN. - EW.

YOU SURE DO HAVE A PRETTY MOUTH.

THANK YOU?

[insect buzzes] - [groans]

OOH.

SHIT.

[door creaks]


OUF.

[groans] - NOT ANOTHER FOR MILES.

[door creaks]

KARINA?

JODY?

BABY, IS THAT YOU?

DONâ€™T BE FUCKING AROUND, MARCUS.

[footstep scuffs]

[yelps]


Iâ€™M JUST PLAYING WITH YOU, BABY.

FUCK.

WHY AM I NOT GETTING A SIGNAL? GOD.

[phone beeps negatively]

[softly] ENOUGH ALREADY.

ITâ€™S ALL YOURS.

LETâ€™S GO.

Iâ€™M SORRY, BUT THE FILES DONâ€™T LEAVE THE ROOM.

HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO DO OUR WORK--

HEY. WEâ€™LL FIGURE IT OUT.

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, MAâ€™AM.

SHIT.

[whistling softly]

CHUCK NEWTON, WHERE ARE YOU?

[clock ticking]

I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND OUR VICTIM.

JASON CHARLES ANTHONY.

ADOPTED BY KAREN AND ROBERT NEWTON.

YOU WERE RIGHT.

HOW DO WE FIND THE KIDS THAT ARE STILL ALIVE?

THATâ€™S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

[melancholy piano and string music]

â™ª

WEâ€™RE HERE.

I HATE THE COPS.

Iâ€™M SORRY, BUT I DONâ€™T THINK WE VIOLATED ANY LAWS, OFFICER.

YOU ARE A REAL OFFICER, RIGHT?

[police radio chatter]

[latch clicks]

[clears throat]

BRANDON Oâ€™CONNELLâ€™S THE NAME.

WELL, Iâ€™M SORRY.

I DIDNâ€™T KNOW IT WAS YOU, MR. Oâ€™CONNELL,

BUT WEâ€™RE MAKING OUR LAST ROUND FOR THE EVENING,

AND WEâ€™D SURE HATE TO SEE YOU GUYS HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

IS THAT ALL... OFFICER?

[people chatting]

[upbeat hip-hop music]

â™ª

OH, MY GOD.

DANG.

SHIT.

DAMN. - THIS IS HOT.

HEY, MAN, WHATâ€™S UP WITH ALL THESE DAMN CAMERAS?

MY DADâ€™S A TELEVISION PRODUCER.

YEAH, HE HAD THIS IDEA FOR A REALITY TV SHOW

WHERE ALL THESE KIDS LIVE IN ONE HOUSE

WITH CAMERAS EVERYWHERE,

BUT A RIVAL NETWORK BEAT HIM TO THE PUNCH.

NO BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW.

AINâ€™T NO PARTY LIKE AN L.G. PARTY...

[mumbling happily]

HEY, "B."

HOPE YOU DONâ€™T MIND. I KIND OF GOT THE PARTY STARTED.

YOU KNOW I DONâ€™T.

Iâ€™M SORRY. WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?



DR. GORDONâ€™S CHEMISTRY 386. JODY WALTERS, RIGHT?

YEAH, THATâ€™S ME. WHO ARE YOU?

CRAZY CAL.

CRAZY CAL, HUH?

CALUCIUS DUPREE, BUT YOU CAN CALL ME CAL.

I DID THE PRESENTATION ON HOW TO CHEMICALLY REDUCE

THE EFFECTS OF A NIGHT OF HEAVY DRINKING.

YEAH, RIGHT. LIKE THAT REALLY WORKS.

BEERS TEN, HANGOVER ZERO.

HERE, BEFORE YOU START DRINKING, SWALLOW ONE OF THESE BABIES.

IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, BREAK...


AND USE.

MAN, THIS NIGGER CRAZY. - DID HE JUST--

I THINK Iâ€™M GOING TO BE SICK.

CAL, CAL, CAL, BEFORE YOU, UH, SCARE ALL OF OUR GUESTS AWAY,

WHY DONâ€™T WE-- - TOUR, TOUR, TOUR.

YEAH, A TOUR.

WHY DONâ€™T YOU SHOW THESE GUYS AROUND?

TOUR? - MM-HMM.

LETâ€™S GO. WHOO-HOO.

THIS IS MY FAVORITE:

THE CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.

NOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE CONFESSIONAL BOOTH,

STAYS IN THE CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.

YEAH. - YEAH.

[grunting and moaning]

[shouts indistinctly]



OR SHOULD I SAY SMOOZE HOUSE?

OH, WHUP THAT SHIT! - DAMN!

WHUP THAT SHIT! - DAMN!

LIKE $500 AN HOUR TO DO STUFF.

THIS IS THE CONTROL ROOM.

OH, WHAT ARE THESE FOR?

YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING. OH, MY GOD.

THOSE ARE THE MONITORS.

THEREâ€™S A CAMERA IN EVERY ROOM, BY THE POOL, IN THE GUESTHOUSE.

THIS IS THE ONLY ROOM WITHOUT ONE.

CANâ€™T MISS A THING ON A REALITY TV SHOW.

SPIN IT UP, MAN.

[water splashes]

MAN, YOU KNOW I DONâ€™T DRINK.

ITâ€™S A GOOD TIME TO START.

YO, THERE SHE IS.

THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

WHO? - GO TALK TO HER.

WHO, SON?

LISA, THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS SINCE FRESHMAN YEAR.

LISA.

[softly] HERE SHE COMES, HERE SHE COMES.

MARCUS, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

HEY.

YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

SWEETIE, YOU DIDNâ€™T JUST TAKE ONE OF THOSE PILLS?

MM-MM. - YEAH, SHE DID.

OH, YOU DID. - YEAH, I DID.

BUT, YOU GUYS, ITâ€™S PERFECTLY SAFE; I SWEAR.

I KNOW CAL SEEMS A LITTLE BIT CRAZY,

BUT HE GOT AN "A" IN CHEMISTRY.

SO DO YOU,

AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A PERIODIC TABLE IS.

GUYS, I THINK HEâ€™S REALLY CUTE.

OH, HONEY, YOU THINK EVERYBODY IS SO CUTE.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

SAY WHAT YOU WANT, OKAY,

BUT YOU GET ONE SHOT IN THIS LIFETIME,

SO GO BIG, OR GO HOME.

ITâ€™S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT FOR SOME OF US.

WOMAN, YOUâ€™VE GOT TO LIGHTEN UP.

ITâ€™S JUST SEX.

ITâ€™S NOT LIKE ITâ€™S ROCKET SCIENCE OR NOTHING.

YOU KNOW WHAT, KARINA? I AGREE WITH HER THERE.

YOU HAVE BEEN WAY TOO UPTIGHT LATELY.

MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO LET BRANDON TAKE THAT ROCKET TO THE MOON.

I THOUGHT YOU GUYS DIDNâ€™T LIKE BRANDON.

GIRL, Iâ€™M DRUNK. - [laughs]

MISS EASTON?

MELISSA EASTON?

WE HAVE A SOCIAL.

I CAN RUN IT FOR HER CURRENT EMPLOYER.

PEOPLE WHO HAVE JOBS DONâ€™T LIVE IN TRAILERS, HASTINGS.

THANKS FOR THE TIP.

WE DONâ€™T HAVE A WARRANT.

SIR!

CRITON!

SIR! TURN AROUND WITH YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

JESUS.

GUESS WE FOUND MELISSA.

LET ME CALL IT IN.

ALL CLEAR IN THERE?

I GUESS.

THEREâ€™S FOUR MORE.

YEAH. - WHERE ARE THEY?

TWO ARE IN BRENTMORE UNIVERSITY.

ONEâ€™S IN FARLEY.

AND THE LAST ONE?

NO LOCATION ON HIM.

HIS FOSTER PARENTS REPORTED HIM MISSING THREE YEARS AGO.


WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

LETâ€™S GO TO BRENTMORE.


[all cheering]

OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. I GOT ONE. YOU GUYS READY?

HOLLYWOOD SLUTS. AND Iâ€™LL GO FIRST.

COLIN FERRELL--ASSHOLE. GO.

TARA REID. YOU.

ERIC BENET.

CARMEN ELECTRA.

WAIT, HOLD ON. DENNIS RODMAN. DENNIS RODMAN.


I GOT ONE, I GOT ONE, I GOT ONE, I GOT ONE.

STUPID FUCKING GAMES. Iâ€™LL START.

QUESTIONS.

[all oohing]

I INVITE YOU TO MY HOUSE. YOU DONâ€™T LIKE MY PARTY.

YOU DONâ€™T LIKE THE GAME I CHOSE.

LET ME GUESS: YOU GOT A BETTER FUCKING IDEA, HUH?

AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

75. HERE ARE THE RULES.

FIRST AND FOREMOST, ALWAYS-- AND I REPEAT--

ALWAYS DIAL STAR 67 BEFORE MAKING A CALL.

IF YOU DONâ€™T, THAT WILL ALLOW THE WEIRDO/ASSHOLE

ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE TO CALL YOUR DUMB ASS BACK.

YOU HAVE 75 SECONDS.

THATâ€™S 1 MINUTE AND 15 SECONDS

TO COMPLETELY TRICK THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE

INTO BELIEVING WHAT YOUâ€™RE PITCHING

IS ABSOLUTELY REAL.

IF THEY HANG UP, YOU LOSE.

IF THEY LAUGH, YOU LOSE.

OR IF THEY SIMPLY NOT BUYING

THE BULLSHIT THAT YOUâ€™RE PITCHING, YOU LOSE.

SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

WE JUST DIAL A RANDOM NUMBER IN THIS AREA?

NAH, CALL YOUR MAMA. [all chuckle]

OF COURSE WE DIAL A RANDOM NUMBER.

THATâ€™S THE POINT OF A PRANK CALL.

Aâ€™IGHT, NOW, WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

ME. LET ME GO FIRST.

RULE NUMBER ONE:

ALWAYS DIAL STAR 67 BEFORE MAKING A CALL.

AND YOU, BIMBO BARBIE, HAVE LOST YOUR TURN.

AW, COME HERE. - [baby talk]

AW.

Aâ€™IGHT, WHOâ€™S NEXT? - Iâ€™LL GO NEXT.

ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU.

STAR 67, HUH?

[line ringing]

HELLO?

HEY, LADY, I FOUND YOUR DOG DEAD IN THE STREET.

OH, MY GOD.

I GOT HIS FURRY LITTLE BODY RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME.

[breathily] Iâ€™M SORRY.

I ACCIDENTALLY HUNG UP THE PHONE WHEN I ROLLED OVER ON MY BACK.

UM, I THINK MAYBE YOU--

[exhales] OKAY.

Iâ€™M ON MY BACK NOW, ROY.

WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TOUCH NEXT?

HEY, SUGAR, IS YOUR HUSBAND HOME?

NO, HEâ€™S NOT. MAY I ASK WHOâ€™S CALLING?

WELL, Iâ€™D RATHER NOT SAY RIGHT NOW,

BUT DO HAVE TO GET SOMETHING OFF MY CHEST--

[crying] I DID IT. DO YOU HEAR ME?

I FUCKING DID IT.

WHAT? WHY DID YOU CALL ME?

AND WHO IS THIS? WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

I KILLED HIM, YOU BASTARD, JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

OH, MY NIPPLES ARE SO HARD.

[breathing heavily]

OH, ROY.

OH, I WISH YOU WERE HERE.

Iâ€™M ALMOST THERE, ROY. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

OH, MY GOD. - JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

WELL, LETâ€™S JUST SAY YOUR HUSBAND IS A SWITCH-HITTER,

AND HEâ€™S BATTING 1.000 FROM BOTH SIDES.

[chuckles softly]

WELL, SINCE YOUâ€™RE WATCHING ME AND YOUâ€™RE A KILLER...

[woman whimpering] YOU SHOULD REALLY ENJOY THIS.




[phone ringing]

DONâ€™T TELL ME YOUR DUMB ASS DIDNâ€™T PRESS STAR 67

BEFORE YOU CALLED THAT WEIRD MOTHERFUCKER, MAN.

I DID.

THEN WHY THE FUCK IS THE PHONE RINGING?

MAYBE ITâ€™S JUST SOMEONE CALLING.

WELL, JUST ANSWER IT.

HELLO?

WE GET DISCONNECTED,

OR DID YOU JUST NOT LIKE MY WORK?


[screams]

[grunting]

[screaming]

[sounds of torture]

I KNOW Iâ€™M A LITTLE ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES,

THIS IS FAR FROM A GAME.

LOOK, YOU SICK FUCK, YOU CALL BACK HERE ONE MORE TIME,

I PROMISE YOU, I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN

AND BREAK EVERY FUCKING BONE IN YOUR BODY.

NOT IF I FIND YOU FIRST.

[line beeping]

THAT GUY WAS PROBABLY JUST SOME FREAK, YOU KNOW?

YEAH, MAN.

ITâ€™S PROBABLY NOTHING.

I THINK WE SHOULD CALL THE POLICE.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

THE NEAREST POLICE STATION IS OVER 45 MINUTES AWAY.

BESIDES, NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THIS HOUSE IS ANYWAY.

NO ONE KNOWS WEâ€™RE FUCKING UP HERE EITHER.

THIS SOME BULLSHIT, MAN.

YEAH, I MEAN, MAYBE BRANDONâ€™S RIGHT, MAN.

THIS LITTLE DUDE RIGHT HERE WILL BECOME HIS BODY BAG.

THATâ€™S NOT FUNNY.

I KNOW, PAPA, I KNOW.

BUT IF YOU WANNA PACK THAT INSIDE OF ME,

YOU GOT TO PACK IT INSIDE OF THIS.

HOW â€™BOUT YOU JUST LET ME STICK THE HEAD IN?

DO YOU THINK ITâ€™S EASY TO SEE YOUR PARENTS

MURDERED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU...

[screams]

ALL OVER A FUCKING GAME?


OF COURSE, I HAD A FEW ISSUES AFTER THAT,

BUT THEY DIDNâ€™T HAVE TO SEND ME TO FARLEY.

YOU STILL THINK THIS IS A FUCKING GAME.

YOU CAN GET HELP.

I DONâ€™T NEED ANY HELP.

I GOT HELP EVERY FUCKING DAY

FOR TEN SHIT-FILLED YEARS.

THE ONLY THING THATâ€™S GONNA HELP

IS TO KILL ALL OF MY PROBLEMS

ONE BY ONE.

[door rattling]

[gasps]

[door slams]

THANK YOU.

[growling softly]

ARE YOU AFRAID OF HIM?

HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND IN FARLEY.

HE GAVE ME A NEW LIFE

AFTER YOU STOLE MINE.

[screams]

[choked moaning]

Iâ€™M SORRY. I HAD TO DO IT.

[body thuds]

NO MORE LOOSE ENDS.

[whimpers]

MY BROTHERâ€™S PROBLEM WAS...

HE WAS TOO WEAK,

DOING ALL THAT NIGGER TALK,

GOING ALONG WITH ALL YOU ASSHOLES

AS YOU KEPT PLAYING THAT GAME,

THE SAME FUCKING GAME THAT KILLED MY PARENTS.

DID YOU THINK THAT IF I GOT OUT

AND SAW YOU DOING THE SAME FUCKING THING

THAT IT WOULDNâ€™T FILL ME WITH RAGE?

MAN, THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO!

FUCK YOU!
