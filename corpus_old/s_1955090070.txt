You ready?

Yes.

Then get in.

This is Melissa.

Hi.

Hello.

So you're going to be
working with Miss Ricard?

That's right.

That's cool.

You'll probably be doing
most of the driving now.

Miss Ricard doesn't drive.

Okay.

Can you handle a gun?
You'll need that.

You'll need a gun.

Yes.

I worked security
for a few years.

That's just great!

That's great.

You can stay in the office
until you find a place.

Thank you.

Here's the box you
had me pick up for you.

Thank you.

What's in there?

I didn't look or anything.

I was just wondering.

They're just old memories.

Okay!

Well, I'll leave you to it.

If you need Miss Ricard you
just press that little button

there on your desk.

Thank you.

Can I help you?

I'm here to see Rose Ricard.

Do you have an appointment?

No.

One moment.

I need to see Rose Ricard.

I'm Grant. How can I help?

I need to see Rose...

How are you feeling?

I'm so sorry.

I just, I haven't eaten in days.

Would you like Melissa
to call you an ambulance?

No, no.

I'll be fine.

How can I help you?

I need to see Rose Ricard.

I'm sure I can help you.

Detective Rigers told me
she was a special consultant

with the sheriff's department.

He says that Rose has a gift.

My husband has been
missing for three months.

Who is your husband?

Daniel Landers.

The boxer?

Yes.

Police closed that case.

No, unresolved.

What makes you believe
your husband is still alive?

Because of this.

Was is it?

It's an inventory
list of all the items

he kept in a safe deposit box.

I checked that box three
days ago and there was a gold

necklace in it that
wasn't there before.

And what did the police day?

Police won't help.

They said it wasn't enough
evidence to reopen the case

but I know it was him.

I just know Rose could
find him, I know she could!

If your husband is alive
and what you say is true,

it means he didn't
wanna be found or,

the locker was always there
and your husband is dead.

Dead or alive,

I want to know.

I need to know.

I understand.

Hello.

I'm Rose Ricard.

Something's wrong.

Miss Ricard?

Can you please
come to the front?

Hey, Rose.

Stay there.

You're going to need that gun.

Please don't!

Please don't!

I asked for the bitch!

Not you!

Let's just calm down, sir.

Don't tell me to calm down.

Where is she?

She's not here.

Then go get her!

Ruined my life.

She ruined my life,
man. I was a teacher.

I used to help people.

He was raping and torturing
women in his basement!

Shut up!

You don't know that.

Neither does she.

Now, I got the cops after
me and I can't go home.

You don't really wanna
hurt anyone, brother.

Stop telling me
what I'm gonna do!

And go get her.

Look, I tell you what...

how about you just
walk out of here

and pretend this never happened?

All right?

Come on, man!

You and I know that ain't
gonna happen today, so stop!

No, it can. It can.

I'm putting my gun down.

All right? We can
make this work.

Mr. Shevers...

Come here, come here, come here.

Call 911.

Rose.

Detective Rigers

Self defense again?

Yes, he was going to kill me.

Your weapon came back clean.

Of course it did.

Can I speak to you for a second?

What do you really
know about this guy?

I know enough.

I suppose that's better
than knowing too much?

You be careful.

I always am.

So what do you think?

About what?

Abagail. Her case.

What should we do?

We should help her.

And the guy with the gun?

You don't think we
should talk about that?

What do you want me to say?

I wanna know what you're
thinkin'. What you feel.

It doesn't matter what I feel.

My mother used to say,

"Feelings are like
a thousand sun rises.

"All different, ever-changing."

Soon I'll feel
something different.

But that man was shaken.

He was a rapist.

And now he'll never
hurt anyone else.

Have you ever thought,
what if you...

-What if I'm wrong?
-Yes.

I used to, when I was young.

Eventually you
accept what it is.

You know what you
shouldn't know.

You see what you
shouldn't be able to see.

Do you ever wish
you didn't have it?

Who am I to decide
God's will for my life?

I just want to be sure I'm
living well inside of him.

Rose, come here.

Mrs. Bordeaux called
from the school today.

You know why?

Yes.

You cannot speak to
your teacher that way.

Daddy, she accused me of
cheating and I didn't do that.

And?

And, so I told her what I saw.

Her sin was great.
She's an alcoholic.

It is not your place
to speak of such things.

I want you to refrain
from using your gift

unless I instruct you to.

Daddy, God did not give
me this gift to hide it.

Neither do men light a candle
and put it under a bushel,

but on a candlestick
and it giveth light

unto all that are in the house.

Your gift is there to help
save people, not condemn them.

Judge not, lest ye be judged.

Do ye not know that the
saint shall judge the world?

And if the world is
to be judged by you,

are ye unworthy to judge
the smallest matters?

First Corinthians, 6:2.

You have not wisdom,
nor knowledge!

My people are destroyed
because of lack of knowledge!

But he that is spiritual
judgeth all things,

yet he himself is
judged of no man.

First Corinthians, 2:15.

When pride comes,
then comes disgrace!

But humility comes
wisdom, Proverbs 11:2.

The eyes of the arrogant
man should be humbled

and the pride of
men brought bow!

Isaiah, 2:11. The pride
of your heart deceives you!

Proverbs 28:26, He that
trusteth in his own heart

is a fool but he who walketh...

Enough!

You will learn that all
that is revealed to you

is not meant to be spoken.

Don't you test me again!

Now go to your room.

Rose.

Rose.

Yes?

Never mind.

Good afternoon.

-Good afternoon.
-I'm Rose Ricard.

This is my associate
Grant Summit.

Mrs. Landers is expecting us?

Please come in.

Thank you.

This way, please.

Thank you, Matty.

You're welcome.

Hello, Mrs. Landers.

-Mrs. Landers.
-Miss Ricard.

We decided to help you. We
just have a few questions.

Okay.

Where was your
husband last seen?

Let me show you.

Please.

This way.

It was here.

He was on a business
call and I went upstairs

so I wouldn't disturb him.

When I came back
down, he was gone.

His car was still in the
garage, his keys and wallet

on the dresser
where he left them.

There's so much sadness here.

I miss him so much.

I know you do.

There were allegations
of affairs before

and during your marriage.

Yes, well,

I guess I just
chose to ignore them.

I know my husband loves me.

But you didn't ignore them.

You're very angry
at your husband.

I was.

I was very angry.

But that doesn't mean
I didn't love him.

And your husband
hasn't made any contact

with you at all?

No.

All of his credit
cards and bank accounts

are still active,
haven't been touched since

he disappeared.

I don't meant to sound ignorant,

but how does it work?

How does what work?

It's a gift.

All spirit-filled
believers have discernment,

mines is just more
acute than most.

I went to psychics.
Soothsayers, voodoo priests.

No one was able to help me.

There's a spirit
world all around us.

Even now I hear them whispering

but it's not the vile utterings
of demons that I lean on.

It is the spirit of truth
who reveals all things.

Can you help me?

We will do our best.

I just, I wish...

Here's everything
that I've compiled

over the last three months.

Thank you.

We'll be in touch.

It says here that he
trained at the old gym

out on Westport.

Alexander Rachet runs that gym.

I used to train there with him.

Yeah, I didn't wanna
say this before but I,

I knew Daniel Landers.

We used to train
together for a while.

Rose.

Rose!

Yes?

What are you thinking?

I was just thinking,

he left behind everything.

His whole identity.

Who does that?

Someone scared. Someone running.

Even when you're scared,
you take some things.

Access to cash, identification.

Something.

Maybe it all happened too fast.

He didn't have time.

No.

When someone leaves behind
their identity it's because

they plan on getting a new one.

Jake Ballard.

Yes.

Jake Ballard.

What y'all doin' here?

You're trespassin'!

Keep that witch away from me!

Look man, we just wanna
ask you a few questions.

I ain't got nothin'
to say to you!

Hey hey hey hey.
Don't do that again.

I want y'all off my property!

Look...

Rose!

Just go on, just go on now.

I don't wanna hurt you.

Rose.

Just, don't go no further.

Just back up.

Don't make me hurt you.

You're not going to hurt me.

Just get your ass in the house.

What y'all want?

Did someone named Daniel
Landers come to you

for some new documents?

What kind of documents?

I don't know anything
about any documents.

The documents your
create for fugitives.

Did you create those
for Daniel Landers?

Well, I...

Do you think that
you can lie to me?

Do you think I don't
know the lies in your mind

-birthing as we speak?
-Well, I just...

Another lie!

This guy. Hey!

This guy, have you seen him?

Have you seen him?

Don't make me do this.

Tell me what you know.

He came for a new passport.
Birth certificate, the works.

Did he say where he was going?

They never do and I never ask!

Don't lie.

He's not lying.

He doesn't know.

Like she said, I don't know!

Come on, let's get out of here.

Wait.

There's something else.

Damnit.

Enough!

Okay, okay okay!

Tell me what you know.

Okay, there was
somebody with him.

A women, I never
seen her before.

What was her name?

I don't know!

What was her name!

He doesn't know.

Tell me what else you know.

She was black.

Short with long hair.

That's it, that's it.

Look, I said that's it, I swear!

The chain is slicker
than she think!

So I'II...

I'll wait in the car.

Here we go.

Harder! Come on!

My wife hits harder than you.

All right.

Harder!

Come on, put some snap into it!

All right, good.

Now, face me. There we go.

Here it comes.

No, no!

Here!

All right, all
right. Try it again.

All right. Harder!

It's all right.

It's okay.

Go and hit the shower.

Unbelievable.

You haven't changed
a bit, old man.

As bitter as an old
sock dipped in vinegar.

My God, look what
the devil drug in.

Ha!

Would it hurt you to check in
on an old man once in a while?

I know, I should
have done better.

I could use some help
with these young punks.

Really?

You saw what I was
doin'. Snap some.

That's what I'm talkin' about.

Come on.

Shit.

I'm getting too
old for this shit.

Well these boys need you.

What these boys need is
a swift kick in the ass.

That's what they need.

No.

All right.

So!

What can I do you for?

Daniel Landers.

What about him?

I'm investigating
his disappearance.

Investigating.

Yes, for his wife.

Well I told the police
everything I knew

a couple of months ago.

Yeah, but I want you to tell
me what you didn't tell them.

What good can come from
pissing on a dead man's grave

Who said he was dead?

Man leaves town,
doesn't wanna be found.

Just about as good
as dead, isn't he?

I'm just trying to help
his wife get some closure.

Closure. How about you?

You get closure?

I'm working on it.

Yeah, I heard you're working
with that Ricard woman.

Yes.

Does she know about your past?

What, haven't you heard?
She knows everything.

Well, what's that like?

I mean, being with a woman
who can read your mind?

She doesn't read minds.

What's the difference?

It's like walking around
buck naked with your dick

hanging out all day.

Well, she takes care of
me and I take care of her.

Tell me a little bit
more about Landers.

Daniel.

One of the best fighters
I ever worked with.

Heavy hands.

Lightning fast.

His footwork
defense, impeccable.

But...

he wanted a title shot.

What's wrong with that?

Desperate people
do desperate things.

Look, what I'm gonna tell
you not a lot of people know

but that fight was a set up.

A set up?

Some big money from Vegas,

they arranged him
to take a dive.

Daniel, he was supposed
to get half his purse,

word is, he stiffed him.

He didn't even pay him.

I mean, maybe it's their
way of cleaning up a mess.

I don't know.

And Razer?

Died in a drunken car wreck.

Razer didn't drink.

You and I know that.

But Daniel, Daniel got his shot.

That could have
been you, you know.

But so much rage, so much anger.

You were bound to burn out.

I didn't burn out. All I
needed was some guidance.

Maybe if you put the same into
me that you put into Landers

maybe things would have
turned out differently.

I loved you like a son.

There was a deep dark hole
inside of you that nothing

would fill, not me, not nothin'.

Take care of yourself, old man.

Shit.

Rose.

Hey, are you okay?

Yes.

I'm fine.

What did Rachet say?

He said a lot.

Daniel's championship
fight was a set up.

Razer was paid to take a dive.

Daniel was supposed
to split the purse

with the guys who set
it up, but he never did.

Well that's
certainly a reason for

someone to want you dead.

Yeah, right.

And these are the type of
people that wanna disappear from.

That still doesn't
explain the mystery woman

that Jake Ballard mentioned.

Well he did give
me one other lead.

Some little jazz house
on Williams street

which is a front for
prostitution among other things.

Apparently Daniel was a
very frequent customer there.

I'm not feeling very well.

Perhaps you can
just take me home

and see what you can find
out there on your own?

Of course.

Are you sure there's
nothing I can do?

Yes...

I'm sure.

You know, I can come in and
just make sure everything

is all right.

I'll be fine.

Okay.

It's very kind of you.

Okay.

Will these pass internationally?

You bet your ass it'll
pass anything domestic

or international.

Can I use your can?

Yeah, it's around the corner.

Wipe the damn seat
off when you're done.

What the hell are
you doin' in there?

Carter?

Carter!

What the hell?

What's your pleasure tonight?

I'm looking for
some information.

There are much more
interesting things in here

than information.

Let me pour you up something.

Give yourself perspective.

Well...

I have all the
perspective I need.

Information is what
I'm in search of.

Do you remember seeing
this guy in here?

You're funny.

You don't play well as a cop.

I'm not.

Have you seen him?

And I had such
high hopes for you.

Yeah but, maybe...

this will help.

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

I have a message
for someone special.

This goes out to Grant Summit.

We miss you. Come back.

This is my place. I'm Nia.

-I'm...
-I know who you are.

How would you know who I am?

I know many things.

This man that you seek.

Those desires
roaring in your heart.

The secrets that
you keep at bay.

I'm looking for Daniel Landers.

Sit down.

I know Daniel.

You know him?

Then is he alive?

A soul never dies, it
simply exists in one reality

or the next.

Do you know where
I can find him?

Your grandfather was
a powerful man, very

strong, earned his strength
from his father, the slave.

I'm not interested
in your parlor tricks.

Tricks are for those

devoid of gifts.

You've seen these gifts before.

No.

I've seen God's spirit working
someone in a powerful way.

I do know there is another
spirit in this world.

You think I work for the devil.

And no marvel, for Satan himself

transformed himself
into the angel of light.

Did Rose teach that scripture?

And how do you know Rose?

I know many things.

The righteous always
flaunt their wisdom

concerning the
things that they know.

What about the things
that they do not know?

Do you know where
I can find Landers?

You love her, don't you?

Do you know where Landers is?

You love her very much!

She can feel it, you know.

She can also feel the
blood-lust raging within you.

She accepts for who I am.

Do you think that you
can solve enough crimes

and help enough people
to make a difference?

To cleanse your
soul of its sins?

God forgives.

God's forgiveness may
get you into heaven

but it won't help you
at all here on Earth.

Acceptance is greater
than forgiveness.

You need someone to
accept who you are,

to believe that there is good

living alongside
the evil within you.

You sound like the serpent.

From the garden of Eden.

I'll keep my ears open
about Daniel Landers.

But if I were you, I would go
check back on Alexander Rachet

he knows more than he's saying.

Come back when you
want some answers.

About yourself.

Jake Ballard was
killed last night.

What?

I heard it over the wire.

How?

Brutally.

Someone...

is trying to cover their tracks.

What is it?

We need to get over to the gym.

I want you to keep the
perimeter locked down

and I need a list of
everybody who was in

and out of here today.

I called the manager,
he's on his way.

Just let me know
when he gets here.

All right.

Rose.

Detective Rigers, what happened?

Well...

we had two murders tonight.

Strange part is, this
one matches the one out

in Scouter County.

Jake Ballard?

That's right.

He also has his throat
cut from ear to ear.

Any leads?

No, not yet. You
getting anywhere?

I think we're getting somewhere.

Do you have any
information you can offer?

-No, all my leads are dead
-ends.

Seems like every time
I get a door opened up,

someone slams it in my face.

Detective Rigers?

She's not worth losing
your family over.

You gonna be okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Look, if you don't wanna
tell me, that's fine.

Just don't lie to me.

This is nothing but the obvious.

This man was like
a father to me.

Everyone we talk
to ends up dead.

Except for Abagail.

Take me back to her house.

Why?

I have something
I wanna ask her.

There's no one here.

Yes, may I help you?

We need to speak
to Mrs. Landers.

She's not here at the moment.

When do you expect her?

She's unavailable
for a few days.

Goodbye.

Let's go.

I'll see you tomorrow.

I just wanna go over the
police report one more time

and...

try to get some rest.

Grant?

Rose?

Why are you just
standing there like that?

You can't tell
what I'm thinking?

You know I'm not a mind reader.

Why haven't you invited
me into the house?

I mean, you came and
seen me for six months

and I'm finally out

and you act like
we're strangers.

My house is my
sanctuary. It's clean.

I'm not clean enough
to come into your house?

I wasn't saying that.

I know how you meant it, I
just don't know if I like it.

Grant.

Are you hungry?

I am.

Come on in.

Let me make you dinner.

So my parents had me in
prayer two hours a day,

and I never really
had any friends.

Wow.

Must have been tough.

They said they wanted
to open my spiritual eyes

so that I could see people.

When they were sure of my gift,

it went from two hours to four.

I still do it to this day.

Four hours of prayer, every day.

Yes. Every day.

Well, that's commitment.

It's the only way
to quiet my thoughts.

Is that how it happens,
you hear a voice?

Not quite.

I see it more than I hear it.

It's like you're wearing a...

white shirt and you have
a grape juice stain on it.

And the sin's the stain
and the more sin there is...

the bigger the stain.

Or sometimes I get
this feeling in my gut

that something's not right.

You know, everybody
gets that feeling.

You've had that feeling
before, haven't you?

Yes.

Yeah well,

whenever I get it...

I'm always right.

How did your family
find out about your gift?

We used to have church,
right in that room.

You must be in this world!

Yes, God.

But not of this world.

Yes.

Then God of this world
is the father lies

and evil and every
source of weakness.

That's why we must
open our spiritual eyes

so we can see!

Yes!

So you can see.

Somebody say, "No
more blinded eye."

No more blinded eye.

No more blinded eye!

No more blinded eyes!

But we wrestle not
against flesh and blood

but against principalities,
against powers,

against the rulers of the
darkness of this world!

Against spiritual wickedness
in the high places!

There's a monster
under your bed.

A demon in your closet!

So you can't fight him,
if you can't see him!

That's why you need the power!

Holy Ghost!

Mrs. Belaire, God sees
the lies on your tongue.

The sin in your words are
stench to God's nostrils.

Mr. Moy...

the lust in your heart
flows through your blood!

Your adulterous flesh
is enmity against God!

Woe unto you, woe unto you!

Hallelujah!

Hallelujah!

I just don't understand why.

What?

For all that you can
see, you don't see me.

I think we're too close.

Feelings are deceptive.

What's wrong with
having feelings?

They cloud my
judgement. My gift.

I need to be clear.

Clean to receive.

Grant...

I'm not the woman for you.

I'm not the woman for anyone.

Don't a man get to decide that?

I just...

I can't let myself
feel those feelings.

I can't be open that way.

Do you believe that
God would give you...

a gift like this and
have you bear it alone?

What if I'm your gift?

Why would God do that to you?

What do you mean?

I would have died in
that chair waiting.

Withering away.

You saved me.

Only God saves.

You can let yourself out.

I'm sorry.

For what?

For your sadness.

Your rejection.

At least you told her
there's a freedom in it.

There's always a price
to pay for freedom.

That something your
grandfather taught you?

Stop.

Rose Ricard may see
the sin in a man...

but I see the whole man,
the good and the bad.

It's unnatural for a
man to try to be perfect.

He needs an outlet.

For his rage.

For his masculinity.

I want you to be
the man that you are.

The good, the bad.

The in-between.

When I met Rose, she
was coming to the prison

to visit some inmates.

She would pray with them.

She heard about my
case and I told her

like I told everybody,
I was innocent.

I could see in her eyes
that she didn't believe me

but she didn't care.

She kept coming to see me.

At the time I didn't
know about her...

gift.

You beat to death three
men with your bare hands.

You told them it
was self-defense.

But it wasn't.

They thought it was,
because it was three of them

and one of you.

I went looking for them.

The men that lynched
my grandfather.

And you made them pay.

Damn right.

When I asked them about it...

they said my grandfather wasn't

little more than
a two-cent slave.

And I know why I
wouldn't ever know

that they're guilty.

And with grave-intent...

I avenged my grandfather.

And that was the
right thing to do.

Rose...

she stayed by my side.

She said when I got
out, I'd have a job,

and a place to stay.

She needed you more
than you needed her.

How...

how do you know
so much about Rose?

We grew up together.

And then I had to move away.

You see my future, right?

The future is full of
possibilities, but...

yes.

I can see yours clearly.

Lift your hands.

You're healed by the
blood of the lamb.

Be free.

Daughter.

Come.

My daughter.

You are meant for greatness

but the weight of your
sin is decaying your faith.

Be set free from bondage.

Be set free from your bondage.

Be free.

Be free from your bondage.

Do you wanna be free?

Yeah.

Yeah, I wanna be free.

Don't you wanna be free?

Don't you wanna be free?

Yeah, I wanna be free.

Be free!

Be free.

Hallelujah!

Yes, I wanna be free!

How does it feel,

to have killed a man
with your bare hands?

I can still feel the
anger inside of you.

Come on.

Wake up.

Come on.

Come on, be free, baby.

Yes!

I want you to take me.

Yes!

You want it?

That's right.

Take it.

You've gotta let God do it!

God.

You know I could have
walked, but thank you.

It's absolutely my pleasure.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

You seem a little distracted.

Maybe a little.

Rose, to whom much is given,

much is required.

But remember, emotions
cloud your discernment.

Separate it,

and you'll be just fine.

Good night.

Good night, Rose Ricard.

You should get your phone.

Rose?

Yeah. You okay?

Yeah.

Okay okay okay, I tell you what.

I'm on my way, I'll be there.

Stay with me.

I have to go.

I need you.

She needs me.

Rose!

Rose!

Are you okay?

I'm sorry.

Nia

Nia's my sister.

Sister?

I didn't know.

Daddy! Please don't go.

I just had a vision.

A vision of what, sweetheart?

Something really bad.

Nia, let your father go.

You shouldn't tell tales, Nia.

Don't covet your sister's gift,

you'll have a gift
of your own one day.

No, I promise I
really did see it.

Maybe you should
listen to her, Clarence.

Ella, don't encourage.

Please don't go!

Listen, I've told
you about that lying

and I want you to stop it.

Fear is of the devil,
you understand me?

Yes, but...

No buts!

We'll be back in a
couple of hours. Rose?

Watch your sister.

Wait!

Daddy!

Daddy, wait.

Nia. Nia!

I hate you!

We found out later that
day that our parents

had been killed
in a car accident.

That's why I don't
drive 'til this day.

So, what do we do now?

We move on.

Grant, I know that you
weren't trying to hurt me.

And without forgiveness,
there can be no redemption.

Forgiveness.

Yes.

You have to forgive the men
that killed your grandfather.

My mother died when I was ten

and my father was never around.

But my grandfather,

he was my hero.

He taught me how to be a man.

You never told me
how it happened.

It was just a regular day.

We were walking
home from fishing.

They pulled up on
us with some guns

and made us get in
the back of that truck.

I was so scared but
my grandfather wasn't.

It's like he knew
something I didn't.

They dragged in the woods and

tied us up and beat on us
for what seemed like hours.

Laughing...

drinking and pissing on us.

And then...

they made me watch.

As they strung my grandfather
up on an old oak tree and...

the last thing he said to me,
"Boy, don't you feel no fear!

"Don't you feel no fear!"

When a man sees
something like that...

he ain't never
gonna be right again.

That day all I wanted
to do was die too.

I know.

We have to go to the office.

Why?

Just a feeling.

I'm just thinking
if they get there,

because one more dead
body's not gonna...

Rose, Mrs. Landers
is here to see you.

Good afternoon.

Good afternoon, Mrs. Landers.

We weren't expecting you.

I know.

I wanted to thank you
for all of your help

in trying to find my husband.

But we're not finished.

I've just come to
accept the fact that

dead or alive, he
doesn't want to be found.

I wanted you to give me
closure but the truth is,

I needed to find
that for myself.

Thank you for all of your help.

Mrs. Landers, we feel that...

Rose, I'm sure that
you sense something

but I need you to
let it go, okay?

Just let it go.

She's afraid of
someone or something.

We need to get to Harvey's.

You know I can't go there.

There are answers
there that we need.

You haven't been back here
since the incident, have you?

No.

Why would I want
to come back here?

Hey.

I really don't think
this is a good idea.

Nonsense.

Why are we here?

I don't know.

I just feel that we're
supposed to be here.

What do you remember?

I remember everything.

He sat right there.

Rutger came in last.

Laughing.

When did you make up your mind?

I knew I was going to
kill him before I even went

into the building.

Just five feet away. He
didn't even notice me.

I wish...

I could kill him all over again.

It's Abagail.

Yes.

Now who do you suppose
is gonna walk in next?

You already know.

Daniel.

Don't.

Just...

watch.

I did what you asked me to.

Did you bring the
rest of the money?

It's in the trunk.

Keys are under the seat.

Good.

Take the black phone and
throw it into the river

on the way home.

How will you be
able to reach me?

Two days I'll send word.

Go now.

Don't.

Alex said you hit hard.

You hit like a fucking girl.

Come on, man.
That's all you got?

Come on. You got
some more, I know.

Get out.

Hey, I'm gonna drive
her over to the house.

You meet me there, okay?

Pick me up there in
just a few minutes.

Okay, okay.

I'm go and ask if
anybody knows anything.

Be careful.

You drive!

Stop the car, I'm not
gonna ask you again.

Okay, okay!

Someone delivered a phone
to my house yesterday.

At 5PM it rang.

-It was Daniel.
-Yes!

What did he say?

He said that he was alive

and that he had to
disappear because

because of this
money that he owed

to the Las Vegas racketeers.

Where has he been all this time?

Here in the city, hiding out.

What else?

That's all I know, I swear.

Get out of the car.

-What?
-Get out of the car!

Grant, I need you
to meet me at Nia's.

I'm on my way.

Yeah. Okay.

God...

please.

Please give me strength.

I'm looking for Nia.

She's not here.

You're lying.

And what if I am?

I'm not very fond of liars.

There.

-My long
-lost sister, at last.

Nia.

No hugs?

No kisses? No illustration
of love whatsoever?

Why, you'd think
we were strangers.

Don't.

You think I'd hurt
my only sister?

I know what you're doing.

What am I doing exactly?

I see your manipulation.

I know you've been watching.

Following me.

It was you in the black SUV.

Of course it was.

Why?

Nia, I know...

You know how I'm feeling?

You couldn't possibly
how I'm feeling!

Your gift is weak!

It's feeble.

It's your fault mommy
and daddy died that day.

All these years I've
wonder, "Who do I hate more?"

Mom and Dad for not
believing in my gifts, or you?

I...

I made a mistake and...

No, a mistake,

is made without the knowledge

of consequences!

What you did was much worse!

It's as if you put the gun
to their head and shot it!

Why kill all these people?

My God.

You still don't understand,
I didn't kill anybody.

I can taste your lies.

Stop lying!

Poor Rose.

So confused.

So flushed with revelation

and so little understanding.

You used Daniel
Landers to draw me in.

Daniel was customer.

He needed to disappear, I
helped him get a new identity.

And then you made sure
that detective Rigers

sent Abagail to me.

Do you think that you can deny

my existence?

I never tried to deny you!

I just didn't know
what to say to you!

You can tell detective
Rigers he can come out now.

Very good, Rose.

Another one of your customers?

We have a simple
business arrangement.

He does a few things for me,

his wife doesn't find out
about his frequent visits

to my establishment.

What can I say? I'm insatiable.

I thought it was you.

You came into my home.

Guilty.

You tried to kill me.

No, he didn't try to kill you.

That pleasure belongs to me.

No! Nia!

-Stop!
-Die!

-Please, stop!
-Die!

I want you to feel
the pain that I feel!

Please!

Nia!

Are you coming in?

I'm figuring you
want to be left alone.

You're probably right.

You know, there's something that

I still don't understand.

Yes.

When you came up the
stairs at Nia's you...

you shot detective
Rigers without hesitation.

How did you know
he was the killer?

Well...

when I came upstairs
I saw detective Rigers

just looking at Nia
trying to kill you

so I figured that
couldn't be good.

So I took the shot.

That makes sense.

Okay, Rose.

But wouldn't you hesitate...

just a little?

I was wondering how
long it was gonna take

for you to figure it out.

You know, if I
had to chose a gift

it wouldn't be this one.

Knowing the things
I wish I didn't know

and not knowing the
things I wish I did.

Always God's will
what is revealed.

Tell me why.

Why?

You know, so many times I
looked into those big ol'

pretty eyes and I
thought you knew!

But you didn't.

I never forgave Jake for turning
me down when I went to him

for help after I
killed those men.

I tried to leave town, I
bet you didn't know that.

I went back to Jake's house
that night and as I drove up,

I saw detective Rigers
driving off in the SUV.

I killed Jake that evening.

I never forgave those
men for what they

did to my grandfather.

And I never forgave
Alexander Rachet

for choosing Daniel over me.

I don't understand,
why are you doing this?

What are you doing?

No!

No!

Damn! I should have
been the boxing champion!

Alex, boy, he spent
all his time on Daniel!

And yes...

Nia wanted to kill you.

I could see it in her eyes.

And now what?

All those visits.

All those visits in prison, you,

you made me believe
you loved me.

I do love you, Grant.

It's why I couldn't
see you clearly.

Nah, nah, you never
loved me, man.

You don't love nobody!

I protected you!

I would have died for you!

You know what, Rose?

I got a gift too.

I am dangerous.

Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the Lord.

Yes, Melissa?

Tesla Richards is
here to see you?

Yes. Yes, send her in, please.

Good afternoon, Mrs. Richards.

Hi.

How can I help you?

My daughter's been
missing for over a week.

Rose!

I don't know what else to do.
