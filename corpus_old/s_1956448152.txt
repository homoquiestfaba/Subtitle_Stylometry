(RINGING CONTINUES)

ANSWERING MACHINE:
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

MAN: <i>...the Ardor residence.</i>

ANSWERING MACHINE:
<i>Please leave a message</i>

<i>after the tone.</i>

(PHONE BEEPS)

<i>Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, it's Dani.</i>

<i>Uh, I'm sorry
to be calling so late.</i>

<i>I'm just checking in.</i>

<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

<i>Um...</i>

<i>Listen, I got kind of
a scary email from Terri</i>

<i>and she hasn't
been responding.</i>

<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

<i>But, uh, yeah,
it sounds like you guys</i>

<i>have been fighting
or something happened.</i>

<i>Anyway, uh, I just got
a little worried.</i>

<i>So, um, if you can call
when you can,</i>

<i>and of course, you know I'm...
I'm always here</i>

<i>if you need anything,</i>

<i>of course.</i>

Okay, um, I love you.
All right, bye.



(LINE RINGING)

CHRISTIAN: <i>Hey.</i>
Hey, sweetie.

What are you up to?

<i>Um, just smoked
some resin with Mark</i>

<i>and now we're getting pizza.</i>

Oh, nice.

MARK: <i>Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani.</i>
CHRISTIAN: <i>Yeah, um...</i>

(CHRISTIAN CHUCKLES)

<i>He's saying "hi"
right now, over and over.</i>

Hi, Mark.
<i>Hi, Mark.</i>

So, I was calling
just to see if you...

You still wanted
to hang out later?

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>Did we talk about
doing something tonight?</i>

I mean, not...
Not concretely,

but, um,
I just wanted to see...

<i>Um... Well... Okay.</i>

<i>Yeah, I should be able
to swing by.</i>

Cool.
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>


(CHRISTIAN INHALES SHARPLY)

<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

Um, well... (SNIFFLES)

Uh, yeah, um...

I emailed her three times

and still no response

so I'm getting
a little bit nervous, so...

(INHALES SHARPLY)
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

Yeah, probably...

<i>She does this
every other day, Dani.</i>

<i>And only because you let her.</i>

Well, I don't let her,
she's bipolar, so...

<i>Yeah, I know.
But, you do though, babes.</i>

<i>You go straight
to crisis mode.</i>

Well, she's my sister

and even you said that
this email seemed different.

<i>Yeah, right, but...</i> (SIGHS)

<i>Is it though, really?</i>

<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention</i>

<i>just like every other
panic attack she's given you.</i>

Yeah, you're right.

You are right, yeah, I know.

<i>I mean, the more you respond</i>

<i>the more she's encouraged
to keep...</i>

No, I know, I know, I know.
You're right, you're right.

I just... I just needed
to be reminded, thank you.


I'm very lucky to have you.

<i>Yeah, well.</i>

I love you.

(INHALES SHARPLY) <i>I love you.</i>

Okay, uh, I'll see you later?

<i>Yeah.</i>
Okay.

Bye, Mark.
CHRISTIAN: <i>Bye, Mark.</i>


<i>All right.</i>
Bye.

DANI: It's in his tone, like,
you can hear it in his voice,

he's just working up the nerve
to say something.

WOMAN: <i>So be direct!
Confront him.</i>

What if
I've scared him, though?

I'm always roping him
into my family crap.

<i>How do you rope him in?</i>

I'm always leaning on him!

Like, I even called him today
in tears

because my sister wrote
another stupid scary email.

<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

What if I'm scaring him off?

<i>What did your sister write?</i>

Mmm.

Just some ominous bullshit

like she always does
and it's torture.

And I lean on him constantly
for support.

Like, what if
I have overwhelmed him

and he thinks that I just have
too much baggage?

<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

No, not if I...
I went too far, if I leaned too much.

<i>You didn't! He should be there
when you need him.</i>

Yeah, but what if
I need him too often

and it becomes a chore?

<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

<i>Because it shouldn't
ever be a chore.</i>

<i>Would it be a chore
if he leaned on you?</i>

Yeah, but he doesn't ask me
for anything.

I've never even seen him cry,

so I'm the only one
that's leaning.

<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

<i>The only one
making yourself vulnerable.</i>

<i>That's intimacy.</i>

MARK: Dude.
(CHRISTIAN SIGHS)

You have gotta
get off the fence with this.

CHRISTIAN: What if
I regret it later

and I can't get her back?

You don't want her back!
But I might.

Okay, well, then you can

bitch to us about how much
you regret it for that day

and then
we'll remind you again

that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

for, like, a year now

and then you can find a chick
who actually likes sex

and doesn't drag you through
a million hoops every day.

Do you think there is
a masochistic part of you

that is playing out
this particular drama

to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

What work do I need
to be doing, Josh, exactly?

Well, I dunno,
your prospectus, maybe?

Your PhD...

Wow, okay,
thanks for the psychoanalysis.

MARK: It's not
about academics, Josh.

I'm just trying
to get you focused.

WAITRESS: Change?
Um, that's for you.

See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

And don't forget about
all the Swedish women

you can impregnate in June.

Okay, guys.
Don't forget about

all the Swedish milkmaids.
Mmm-hmm.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

MARK: That's not her again.

Seriously?

Oh, my God.

She needs a therapist, dude.
She has a therapist.

Oh, so then she should call
her therapist and not you.

It's literally abuse.

She's abusing you.
'Scuse me.

Nope.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my God.

Okay, excuse me, guys.

Well...
Great.

Hey.
DANI: (CRYING) <i>No.</i>

Dani, babe?
<i>Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.</i>

(DANI SOBBING)

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)


(DANI SOBBING)

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

No, no, no, no, no!

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)

CHRISTIAN: Hey, babe.

How you feeling?

I'm up.

Where you going?

I was just gonna go
to that party for 45 minutes.

But, you just keep sleeping.

No.

No, I'll come with you.

You sure you got enough sleep?

I wasn't sleeping anyway.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

MAN: Yeah, I'm fucking
dreading the summer.

Stuck in a shit-ass hole

listening to my step-mom
fuck my dad all day.

MAN 2: I'll listen to
your step-mom fuck your dad.

MAN 3: Hey, Josh, you, uh,
going to Europe?

JOSH: Uh, yeah, yeah,
for my thesis,

you know, we all are.

MAN 3: Oh, you're all going?

Yeah, they're all coming to
visit my home in Halsingland.

Sweden.

MAN 3: Oh, any occasion,
or is it just for fun?

Uh, well, I'm...
I'm doing my research

on European
midsummer traditions,

these guys
are just tagging along.

MARK:
Mr. Pelle's invited us to

an authentic hippie midsummer
at his yodeling farm.

Oh, yeah?

I mean,
we were talking about it.

We were thinking about it.

For when?

Uh...

Mid-June to mid-July.

Yeah, two weeks from now?

Yeah.

I mean, that's if we even go.

I'm probably
not gonna go, but...

Yeah, we were talking
about it.

(CHRISTIAN SIGHS)

You okay?

Mmm-hmm. Fine.

That was just really weird.

What was?

The...

Sweden.

I had no idea.

Well, what do you mean?

'Cause I told you
I wanted to go.

Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

I just decided today.

I wasn't keeping it from you.

You already have a ticket.

I'm sorry?

Okay, well, just

imagine if you were at a party
and someone said,

"Hey, what're you doing
for summer?"

And then my friend said,

"Oh, we're going to China
for three months

"and we're leaving
in two weeks..."

It's Sweden,
for a month and a half.

And it was the first
you'd ever heard of it.

Okay.

I told you
I wanted to go to Sweden.

No, you said
it would be cool to go.

Yeah, and then
I got the opportunity

and I decided to do it.
Look, I don't mind you going.

I just wish you would've
told me, that's all.

Well, I just apologized, Dani.

You didn't apologize,
you said sorry,

which sounds more like,
"Too bad."

Maybe I should just go home.

What? No, no.

I'm just trying to understand.

And I'm trying to apologize.

And I don't need an apology.

I don't, I just wanted to talk
about it, that's all.

I really think
I should just leave.

No, no, no, no.

Please, please, please. I'm not...
I'm not trying to attack you.

It really feels like you are.
I'm not.

Well, then...
Well, then I'm sorry.

I'm... I just got confused.
I'm sorry, I...

Hey, please, c'mon,
can you come?

Just can you come and sit...
Stop.

...with me, please?

Please, and we can
talk about it.

Look, it just... It just felt
really weird, okay?

But I'm fine,
I think it's great

that you're going to Sweden,
I do.

I think it's amazing.

Are you going for your thesis?

I don't know
what my thesis is.

I know and it...
It can... It will...

It can be inspiring, right?

Right?

In Stockholm, are there
any, like, meatball sex clubs

we should hit up
before we head north?

No, we're going
straight north.

Not straight, straight,
though, right?

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
We gotta go through Stockholm

to get there.

No, it's
the opposite direction.

Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

CHRISTIAN: Guys, it's Dani.

She's coming up. (SIGHS)

Okay.

Should we clear all this?
No, it's fine.

(DOOR BUZZING)

CHRISTIAN: Um,
I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

So you guys know.

She's not actually gonna come,

but I invited her
just to not make it weird.

You invited her to...
Mmm-hmm.

But she's not coming.

She doesn't want to?

I invited her
and she accepted,

but she's not actually coming
to Sweden.

Okay.

Guys, you know
what she's been going through.

Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh,
thought it was...

Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

Okay, that's great.

And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her

and you all know
that she's coming...

Agreed?
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

Yep.
(DOOR OPENS)

DANI: Hey!
CHRISTIAN: Hey, babe!

DANI: Hey, guys.

Hey.
Yo.

DANI: How's it going?

We're chilling.

DANI: Nice.

So, Sweden.

Yeah.
PELLE: You're coming, right?

I mean, I...

I guess so,

if that's not completely
ruining you guys' plans.

Oh, no, no.
No, not at all.

Uh, Christian,
can I get you to take a look

at this paragraph real quick?

CHRISTIAN: Uh, yeah, sure.

I'll be back.
DANI: Mmm-hmm.

Hey, Pelle.
Hi.

What were you drawing?

Uh, just the table.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

How have you been?

Pretty good.
Yeah?

Survived finals, you know.
(DANI CHUCKLES)

And you?
Uh...

I didn't quite finish,

but they're giving me
a break this year.

Oh, God, yes, yes,
of course. Sorry.

It's, uh...

How did you like
the Anthropology department?

I like it, yeah.

Not as much as
this one maybe, but...

You're doing psychiatry,
right?

Uh, psychology, yeah.

Okay.
That's how you know I'm nuts.

Yeah, also that funny look
in your eye.

(DANI CHUCKLES)

So you're coming
to Halsingland?

I guess so, yeah.

And, um, we'll actually
be arriving on my birthday.

Well, happy birthday.
(CHUCKLES) Thank you!

Yeah, Christian says you've
got this special week planned.

Yeah, it's sort of a crazy

nine-day festival
my family's doing.

Lots of pageantry...
Uh-huh.

...special ceremonies,
and dressing up.

That sounds fun.

It'll probably seem
very silly.

But, it's like theater.

Yeah, Christian says you're...

You're from
like a commune, right?

Yeah, we're...
We're a small community.

Here. I'll show you.

Oh, wow.

I see what you mean
about the pageantry.

PELLE: Yeah, we make
those clothes special

for every
winter and summer solstice.

I mean, everybody sort of
does everything together.

That's an interesting symbol.

PELLE: Yeah, we're taught
the Runic alphabet, so...

DANI: Whoa, who's that one?

That's last year's May Queen.
Uh-huh.

Beautiful.

You know, I'm very, very glad
you're coming.

I... I think
it's very good you're coming.

Thank you.

Also, I...

I never had the chance
to tell you...

Mmm.
...but I was...

I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

Oh.
What happened, I mean,

I can't even imagine.

I mean...

I lost my parents, too, so...
Okay.

I kind of have some idea.

I'm sorry.
No!

No, I'm sorry.
No, you're...

I'm gonna just go
to the bathroom, thank you.

(IN ENGLISH)
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

<i>we are beginning our initial
descent into Stockholm...</i>

(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)


Oh, my God, the women here.

What is it
that makes them hotter?

JOSH: The Vikings
grabbed all the best babes

from other countries
and dragged them over.

MARK: Christian, you can do
your thesis on that.

How long is the drive?

PELLE: About four hours.

Oh, my God.

PELLE: Okay,
this is the first stop.

CHRISTIAN: This is it?

PELLE: Not quite, almost.

MAN: Pelle!

Hey!
GIRLS: Hey!

JOSH: Just beautiful.
Oh, my God.

Hey, guys,
so these are younger people

from my village.

They're also returning
from their trips outside.

Come on over.

Hey!

These are my friends
from America.

MARK: Oh, dude.
PELLE: Hey.

Just fucking walk.

MARK: Yeah, dude,
there's so many bugs.

It's beautiful, huh?
DANI: Mmm.

Okay, so this is, uh...

Mark, Dani...
Hi.

Christian and Josh.
(MAN SHOUTING IN SWEDISH)

DANI: What?
(PELLE CHUCKLES)

Give me just one second.

JOSH: You think
he knows that guy?

MARK: He sounded mad.

(MAN SPEAKING SWEDISH)


SIMON: That must be good.

(CONVERSING IN SWEDISH)

Here! Come on over,
come on over.

This is, uh, these are
my great friends from America.

Christian, Dani,

Josh, and Mark.
Hi.

Meet my brother, Ingemar.

Uh, best friends since
we were babies, actually.

Yeah.

So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

Dani? Yeah!
DANI: Yeah!

Awesome! And say hello
to my friends.

This is Simon and Connie

from London.
How's it going?

Hi.
Simon, this is Pelle...

And these are all the names

I just learned
two seconds ago.

(ALL CHUCKLE)

Perfect timing, by the way,

we... We just took these
five minutes ago.

Haven't even started
coming up yet.

Oh, shit!

Do you guys wanna take it now
or should we settle in first?

Fuck it,
let's just take it now, right?

Yeah. Yeah.
Great.

Uh, you know what,

I might have to find
my footing first if that's okay.

Uh, yeah, of course.
Yeah? Okay.

And listen,
if you're feeling uneasy,

you don't have
to take them at all.

No. No, no, no. I just...
I wanna feel settled first.

Okay.
Okay.

I'll wait.
No, no, you go ahead.

No, I'll wait.
Please.

I want us to come up together.

Ready?
Okay?

Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

Dude, we can't take them
at different times,

they'll be
totally separate trips.

CHRISTIAN:
You wanna wait for us then?

You know what,
it's fine, it's fine.

Babe... Babe, no.
(STAMMERS) I'm ready.

No, it's okay,
Don't feel rushed.

I don't, I don't.
It's fine, I'm ready.

MARK: Are you sure?

Yes, Mark, thank you.

They've made mushroom tea.
Mmm-hmm.

If you prefer
against the taste.

Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll try that, thank you.

Ingemar? Ingemar?
Ingemar.

Ingemar, okay. Thank you.
Perfect.

Don't let Mark be the one

to pressure you.
He's not.

Of all people.
He's not, he's not.

It will... It will get
complicated otherwise, it's fine.

Are you ready?
Yes, thank you.

There you go.
Ooh.

Thanks, dude.

INGEMAR: Okay,
here we go then.

Think happy thoughts!
Are you sure about this?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited.
MEN: Cheers!

(PELLE SPEAKS SWEDISH)

All right.
Yeah?

Are you sure about this?

I think it's gonna be fun.
(SNICKERS)

We're in?
Yep, go.

MARK: What time is it?

(EXHALING DEEPLY)
It's 9:00 p.m.

What do you mean?

CHRISTIAN: What do you mean?

That can't be right!
The sky is blue!

CHRISTIAN:
It's fine, it's Sweden.

That's not fine!
Why is it like that?

PELLE: It's okay, Mark.
It's the midnight sun.

That feels wrong,
I don't like that!

PELLE: I promise you,
it's okay.

I'm not okay.

CHRISTIAN: Oh, fuck,
it's a new person.

MARK: What?

I don't want new people
right now.

PELLE: No,
new people are good, Mark.

Hi, hi!

I'm just gonna lay down, okay?

PELLE: Yeah, do that.

Everybody else lay down.

Guys, do it, it feels so nice.

(DANI BREATHING HEAVILY)

Josh, can you lie down,
please?

PELLE: Can you feel that?

The energy.

Coming up from the earth.

(DANI BREATHING HEAVILY)

(WOMAN SINGING FAINTLY
IN SWEDISH)

PELLE: Look!

The trees too,
they're breathing.

Nature just knows
instinctively

how to stay in harmony.

Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

(SINGING CONTINUES)

MARK:
You guys are like my family.


You're like my real,
actual family.

(DANI GASPING)

Dani?

(SINGING GETS LOUDER)

Sorry.

Uh, I'm gonna go for a walk.

CHRISTIAN: I can walk, too.


(WOMAN CONTINUES SINGING)

DANI: No, no, no, no.

Don't think that. You're fine.

It's almost your birthday.

You're okay, you're fine.
You're fine.

(ALL LAUGHING)

Stop it! I'm fine. (EXHALING)

INGEMAR: Hey, Dani!

How are you?

They were laughing at me.

What? No, no, no,
I'm sure they weren't.

They've been laughing.

Want to come meet my friends?

Thank you.
I'm sorry, thank you.



Stop it! Stop it, fuck!


You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

(LIGHTS MATCH)



CHRISTIAN: Hey.

How long was I asleep?

CHRISTIAN: I mean,

we found you here, like,
six hours ago. (CHUCKLES)

Did it get dark at all?

For a couple of hours,
not completely.

Is it tomorrow?

I mean,
from yesterday's perspective.

Come on.

DANI: Where are we going?

What we came for.

MARK: Jesus, Pelle,
where are you taking us?

JOSH: Yeah, this is way
the hell out there.

MARK: Do they have ticks
in Sweden?

Sweden has a tick problem.

MARK: What?

No they don't, do they really?

PELLE: Actually,
it is a big problem.

Last summer,
a record number of people

got tick-borne encephalitis.

MARK: What the fuck?
Are you serious?

JOSH: Both my grandparents
died from ticks.

Had to give them
a closed casket funeral.

MARK: Okay, Josh, I actually
have an uncle with Lyme.

And believe me,
if you ask him,

it was not worth the pleasant
picnic in the park.

He's fucked.

(FLUTES PLAYING)

(FLUTES CONTINUE PLAYING)

CHRISTIAN:
So, this is the place.

PELLE: The tranquil
and majestic Harga.


CHRISTIAN: Pelle, you know
all these people?

PELLE: These are my family!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

MARK:
So we're stopping in Waco

before going
to Pelle's village?

Oh, thank you!

Oh, thank you.
What is it? Strawberry?

Oh, wow, thank you.
CHRISTIAN: Oh, thanks.

This bag?

Thank you... Uh, sorry.

PELLE: Hey, guys?

Meet my sister, Dagny.

Born the exact same day as me.

Hi.
Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

(SPEAKS SWEDISH)

DANI: Uh, <i>tack!</i>
Thank you.

JOSH: <i>Tack.</i>
Hey.

Father Odd!

(SPEAKS SWEDISH)

(CONVERSING IN SWEDISH)

(IN ENGLISH) Sorry,
these are my friends.

Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

FATHER ODD: Hello.
Hi.

(ALL EXCHANGE GREETINGS)

Welcome, welcome.

Hi, oh!
Welcome home.

We are so very happy
to have you.

DANI: Oh, thank you.

Pelle has an immaculate sense
for people.

DANI: I... I love
what you're wearing.

My frock?
Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES)

Yeah, quite girly, no?

We do these as a tribute
in respect of Ymir

and because of the nature's

I think, qualities. Yeah.

Wow, I think the Sakhis saints
do the same thing

in Brajbhoomi?

So, we are your hosts.

So whatever you need,
just say so

and we will accommodate, okay?

Thank you very much.
Yeah.

Today is all festivities.

Um, just tomorrow,
the official ceremony begin

and you are welcome!

Welcome, welcome, welcome.
DANI: Thank you.

Yeah. Enjoy.

Just... Thank you.

MARK: That guy
has a very red face.

PELLE: Yeah?

Do we eat these?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(DRUMS BEATING SOFTLY)

(SPEAKING SWEDISH)

JOSH: Can I take photos?
PELLE: Um... Discreetly.

(CONTINUES SPEAKING
IN SWEDISH)

MARK: Thanks.

SIV: (IN ENGLISH)
Oh, forgive me.

I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

Welcome to Harga,

and happy midsummer!

It has been 90 years
since our last great feast

and it will be 90 years
before our next.

And what poetry
that it's now the hottest

and brightest summer
on record.

We already have
so much to give back

and so, without any
further blathering,

let's raise our glasses.

Let our
Nine-Day feast commence.

(TOASTING IN SWEDISH)

(BREATHING HOARSELY)

(SPEAKING SWEDISH)

(DRUMS BEATING RHYTHMICALLY

(EXHALES AND INHALES SHARPLY)

(PEOPLE GRUNTING)


You guys should join.

Oh, no, I'm too scared.

All right.
Oh, thanks, babe.

What are the kids playing?

Skin the fool.

Skin the fool?
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

Precious.

CHRISTIAN: Hey, Pelle,
can anybody just join in?

You're an American,
just jam yourself in there.

All right.

Hey.

Happy birthday.

DANI: Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

Just something I do
for birthdays.

Maybe it's not appropriate?

No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

It's beautiful.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Anyway, just between us.

Yeah, well...

Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

Oh.

No. No, no, no,
I forgot to remind him

and it's not
his fault, it's...

Never mind, it's okay.


Thank you so much,
I'm really touched.

So, how do you support
this place?

Lumbering, linen,
homeopathics...

Water power plant.

School time over here.

Carving runes?

CHRISTIAN: Really?

They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

MARK: Oh, yeah.
I do that, too.

CHRISTIAN: Oh, fuck.
There's a big one.

JOSH: Oh, shit.

What alphabet is that from?

Uh, the Younger Futhark.

I... I think?
Or is that medieval?

Actually, that is
the Elder Futhark.

So, how long have you two
been together?

Oh, geez, um...
Um...

Just over
three and a half years.

Four years.

No? Really?
Yeah.

Four years in two weeks.

You're right, I'm sorry.

You're right. Four years.
Mmm-hmm.

Yeah, um,
how did you guys all meet?

Well, uh...

We were all working
on the same farm

and funny enough,
I was dating Connie

when Simon and me
first became pals.

Well, we'd been on a date.

And I didn't even actually
know it was a date, so...

You're right. No, no.

I meant that Connie and me
had just become friends.

We... We decided to be friends.

And that was just before

Connie and Simon
started dating.

And now they're engaged.

What? Congratulations!
Wow.

Which is amazing,
yes, congratulations.

Yeah, thanks. Yeah,
we actually asked Ingemar

to officiate the wedding.

Really?
Nah.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)
What's that building over there?

PELLE:
It's like a sacred temple,

but no one's allowed in there.

Uh, let me show you
where we sleep.

INGEMAR: Let me show you
the <i>Rotvalta!</i>

So we're just gonna ignore
the bear then?

INGEMAR: It's a bear.

What's that?

We can check it out.
Yeah.

INGEMAR: Love story.

Oh, wow. What? Wow.

CHRISTIAN: Wow.

Wow, wow, wow.

JOSH: Oh, man. Wow.

It's like in the Scripture.

PELLE: What do you think?

CHRISTIAN:
It's like another world.

JOSH: Amazing.

CHRISTIAN:
People just sleep here?

PELLE:
Yeah, all the younger ones

until we turn 36

and then we move
to the laborers house.

JOSH: Why 36?

Well, we think of life
like the seasons.

So you're a child until
you're 18 and that's Spring.

And then at some point,
we all do our Pilgrimage

which is between 18 and 36.

That's Summer,
and then from 36 to 54,

we're working age,
which is Fall.

And then finally from 54 to 72
you become a mentor.

What happens at 72?

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Not a lot of privacy.

MARK: Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

Especially with all these
dicks on the wall.

There's a lot of dicks.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

Did she say something?

No, no, no, absolutely not.

I just wanted to
let you know before, so...

Are these the May Queens?

Yeah.

Right. Uh, you'll actually
be here for that.

And who are your May Queens?

Uh, every mid-summer,
we have this dance competition

and the winner gets crowned
and this is...

DANI: Oh, wow.
INGE: Hey!

(SPEAKING SWEDISH)

MARK: Was that...

You saw that too, right?

Pelle, who was that?

PELLE: (CHUCKLES) Inge.

MARK: Oh, my God,
I want to give her a bath.

Hey, can I pull you outside
for a sec?

DANI: Yeah, sure.

MARK: Pelle,
tell her to come back.

(WOMEN SINGING FAINTLY)

<i>â™ªâ™ª Happy birthday to you</i>

What?

â™ªâ™ª <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

â™ªâ™ª <i>Happy birthday, dear Dani</i>

â™ªâ™ª <i>Happy birthday to youâ™ªâ™ª</i>

Fuck.

Stop, it's fine.
What?

You didn't think
I forgot, did you?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I got fucked up
by the daylight

and I thought
it was yesterday.

It's okay. It's fine.
Happy birthday.

Happy birthday.
Thank you. I'm not upset.

It's okay.

You should be.
I... I should be.

I'm sorry.


(BABY CRYING)

(CONTINUES CRYING)

All right, beauty rest.

Tomorrow's a big day.

What's tomorrow?

PELLE:
First of the big ceremonies.

<i>Attestupa.</i>

What's that?

Uh, it's too hard to explain,

you'll get
a better sense tomorrow.

JOSH: Wait, seriously?
You can't just tell me now?

JOSH: Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one?

PELLE: I mean,
it's pretty actual.

Fuck.

Do you know what it is?

Dude!

Is it scary?


That is so fucking annoying.

MARK: (WHISPERS)
Yo! Check my scalp for ticks,

then I'll check yours.


(BABY CRYING)

(WOMAN SINGING IN SWEDISH)

(CONTINUES SINGING)

MARK: Somebody should tell
those girls

they're walking stupid.

CHRISTIAN: How long
do they typically stand?

PELLE: We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

CHRISTIAN: Hey. Oh.

Are these for me?
DANI: Mmm-hmm.

You pick 'em backwards?
DANI: Yeah.


Are those the ones?

Yeah.

(CUTLERY CLINKING)

MARK: Dude, I'm so hungry.

It's like they're trying
to make it gross.

WOMAN: Her... Her mother
is on Pilgrimage.

DANI: Oh...
WOMAN: Helps her to detach.

DANI: Okay.

The babies
are raised here by everyone.

Wow. You want this?

(CHANTING IN SWEDISH)

MARK: Dude, are you

I'm beat.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

CHRISTIAN: Okay, okay. Yeah.
MARK: Yeah.

CONNIE: Wait,
what're we doing now?

(HORN SOUNDS)

(SIV READING IN SWEDISH)

JOSH: What is that book?

PELLE: <i>Rubi Radr.</i>
Our scripture.

Can I read that?

PELLE: You would not be able.

(DANI BREATHING HEAVILY)

(BREATHING STILLS)


(JOSH AND DANI SCREAM)


SIMON: Oh, my God!

INGEMAR: It's fine.

SIMON: Did she jump?

What the...

INGEMAR:
It's part of the ceremony.

CONNIE: What?
No, she fell, she fell.

SIMON: Fuck!

CONNIE: She fell, right?
SIMON: Did she jump?

INGEMAR: It's okay.

Oh, my...
Did she fall or did she jump?

It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry.

What do you mean it's fine?

She's fucking dead.
Look at her head!

Look at her head, she's dead!

INGEMAR: It's a part
of the ceremony.

SIMON: Why the fuck are you
standing there like that?

She just fucking jumped
off the cliff.

Are you freaking blind?
What the... Fuck!

Oh, my God.

SIMON: What the fuck?

No, he's doing...
He's doing the same thing.

He's doing the same
fucking thing!

Someone stop!
Sir, don't do it.

Tell him to stop.

Why's everyone just
standing there, what the fuck?

Sir, don't...
Don't jump, don't jump!

Please, someone tell him
not to jump.

CONNIE: What the fuck?
SIMON: Someone tell him...

(CONNIE AND SIMON SCREAM)


(DAN CHOKING)

(CROWD MOANING LOUDLY)

(CONNIE CRYING)
(SIMON SHUSHING)

Fuck, we're going.

Fuck! This is fucked!
CONNIE: Where?

Fuck this! You're fucked!

Fuck! You're all just fucking
standing there watching,

what the fuck is wrong
with you?

(CONVERSING IN SWEDISH)

Please! Please!
No, fucking leave her alone!

Please, listen to me.
Let me explain!

What? Explain what?

Please, my poor thing.
Fucked!

Please! What you just saw

is a long, long,
long observed custom.

"Custom!" It's fucked!
Yes.

Those two who jumped
have just reached

the end of
their Harga life-cycle.

And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

"Joy?"
Yes, and when it is my turn,

it will be a great joy for me.

Fuck.
We view life as a circle,

a recycle.

The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

And that baby over there
who is not yet born

will inherit that name.

Instead of getting old

and dying in pain
and fear and shame,

we give our life.

As a gesture.

A gesture?
Before it can spoil.

It does no good dying,

lashing back
at the inevitable.

It corrupts the spirit.

INGEMAR: I'm so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

You feeling okay?

I just really need to not be
here right now.

Yeah.

DANI: I'm gonna go.

CHRISTIAN: Just take some time
to yourself, okay.

(MAN SIGHS)

(INDISTINCT MURMUR)



(GASPS LOUDLY)


Hey, dude...
Hey!

Holy shit, right?

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Good.

Hey, listen. Um...

I've been thinking
about something

that I wanted to ask you.

Or tell you, actually.

Um...

I've been thinking
a lot about my thesis.

And, um...

I've decided I'm gonna
do it here. On Harga.

And I wanted to
tell you first.

Just so it didn't seem like
I wasn't telling you.

I feel like... I feel like
I can't tell if you're joking.

I mean... I mean, you know

I'm doing my thesis on
midsummer. That's the reason

why I'm here.
Yeah.

Yeah, but not
on this community.

I mean, you're going
to Germany and England next.

Well, you knew I was
gonna wanna do this.

No, I didn't.
Oh, my God.

I mean, did you even know
until just now?

Christian, of course you did!

Okay, do you think
I don't know

what you're doing?

It's actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle.

The fact that you're being
this bald about it.

I'm... I'm honestly
kind of impressed.

What the fuck, man?
What does that mean?

Yeah, what the fuck!
This is what

I've been working toward
and you know it.

That's why you look so guilty
right now, because you know.

You know
that what you're doing

is unethical and leechy
and lazy.

And, frankly,
it's kind of sad.

Fuck you!
No, dude, not fuck me!

Find your own subject.

Or... Or your own passion.

And, because...
All right, look.

I am... I'm actually
invested in this.

This is not some
glorified hobby

that I'm casually
dipping my feet into.

I'm gonna do my thesis here.

If you're gonna
do it here too,

I'm open to collaborating.

And if not, I guess we can
both do separate theses

on the Hargas.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

MARK: Dude, of all the things
to let me sleep through.

What?

SIMON: We're leaving
tomorrow morning.

CONNIE: I know we are.

I told Christian this already,

and now I think he's trying
to pretend like it's his idea,

so if he comes up to you...
PELLE: Well, no,

wait a minute.
I... I seriously doubt that

the elders will approve of
anything being written down.

They're extremely protective.

Okay, so then, I'll just use
aliases for everything.

Problem solved.
Then what would be the point?

You couldn't even get it
peer reviewed.

And Christian did already
ask me this, by the way,

and I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

Ah, fuck. No.

Okay, look, uh,
I'll ask the elders.

Okay? Good.
Yep.

Dani?

Um... I'm really sorry, Pelle.

Thank you for inviting me,
but I... I really have to go.

Can someone maybe
drive me somewhere?

I know I shouldn't have
let you stay for that.

I mean, I know it looks
extreme. But we only...

I don't know
why I'm here, Pelle!

I don't know
why you invited us.

I don't know.
I don't know why...

I don't know why I'm here.
Okay, okay, okay.

It's fine. It's okay.
I don't know and I can't...

Come on. Come on, sit down.
No. (SOBBING)

Dani, please.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Please sit down.

Dani.

I invited my friends

because this is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

and I wanted to share it.

Especially with my friends who
I knew would appreciate it.

Because I...

I am proud of this place.
Okay.

Okay, but I'm not
an anthropologist

and I don't understand
any of this.

Yes, yes, yes. I know.
I don't get it.

I know. And, and yet,

I was the most excited
for you to come.

(WHIMPERING)
Here. Here, smell this.

What is it?

It calms you down.
No, I'm fine.

(SNIFFS)
I don't want it. (SNIFFLES)

Are you sure?
No...

I really want to go, Pelle.
I don't... I don't want it.

Okay.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

I know what
you're going through, Dani.

What am I going through?

Because I lost
my parents, too.

What? No, no, Pelle.
Yes, yes, yes...

That is not what
I'm talking about.

I'm not talking
about my family.

I know that's not what
you're talking about.

I'm not talking
about my family...

I lost my parents
when I was a little boy.

They burned up in a fire.

No, I wasn't talking
about that. (SNIFFLES)

My parents,
they burned up in a fire

and I became,
technically, an orphan.

So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

Because I do,
I really, really do.

Yet my difference is, I never
got the chance to feel lost,

because I had a family here.

Where everyone embraced me.
And swept me up.

And I was raised by
a community that doesn't

bicker over what's theirs
and what's not theirs.

That's what you were given.

But I have always felt held.

By a family. A real family.

Which everyone deserves.

And you deserve.

Pelle, Christian
could walk in.

He's what I'm talking about.

He's my good friend
and I like him, but...

Dani, do you feel held by him?

Does he feel like home to you?

Hey. How you doing?

Today was tough.

You gonna be okay?

Are you not disturbed
by what we just saw?

Yeah, of course I am.

That was really,
really shocking.

I'm trying to keep
an open mind though.

That's cultural, you know?

We stick our elders
in nursing homes.

I'm sure they find
that disturbing.

I think we really need to just
at least try to acclimate.

(BABY CRYING)

Hey, do you... Sorry.

Um, do you have
a sleeping pill I can take?

Yeah, sure.

Thanks.

What'cha doin'?

Just working in the garden.

(JOSH SIGHS)

Hey, man.
Hey.

Any word?

Yeah, they said you can do it.

As long as you absolutely
don't use any names.

Okay. Wow.
Or the location

is never even hinted at.

Okay.
And you'll have to sign

an agreement to that.

And you're splitting it
with Christian

because he came to me first.

Well, that's... We'll...
We'll figure that out.

I gotta go take a leak.

Uh, here, can I
ask you something?

Yeah.
Uh...

Do you know what this is?

I found it
under Christian's bed.

Oh. That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

A love rune. Huh.
Yeah.

Under Christian's bed?
Yeah, yeah.

What's going on?

PELLE: Uh, the elders said
you can do your thesis

as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

Are you serious?

Yeah.
(LAUGHS)

Oh, my God, thank you, man.

That is incredible news.
Thank you.

You're splitting it
with Josh as well.

Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

Okay. Well, I think my sister

Maja has taken
a liking to you.

CHRISTIAN: Yeah?

The red head?

Actually, she just got
the <i>byxmyndig</i> last year.

It basically means that,
uh, you are...

You are allowed to have sex.
Pants license.

Okay. Good for her.
ULF: Hey!

(ULF SHOUTING IN SWEDISH)


(ZIPS PANTS)
Hey, whoa!

What? Okay, relax. Relax!

What did I do?

Pelle, what is going on?
What happened? What happened?

(CONTINUES SHOUTING

What did I do? What did I do?

Dude! Okay!

PELLE: You pissed
on the ancestral tree.

The tree... So what?
Yes, yes.

(IN ENGLISH) "So what?"

(CONTINUES SHOUTING
IN SWEDISH)

I didn't know.
No, it's...

That tree is tied
to all of our dead.

(ULF SOBBING)
It's a dead tree, though.

It's dead.
Yeah, yeah, I know.

But it's important to us.

I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

DANI: Hey.

CONNIE: Hey. It was
really nice to meet you.

I'm so sorry.
We're actually leaving.

DANI: What?

CONNIE: Yeah.
FATHER ODD: Connie.

CONNIE: Simon is getting
the truck with one of them now.

FATHER ODD: Connie.
DANI: Is everything okay?

FATHER ODD: Connie.

Oh, there.

Uh, Simon,
he told me to tell you

that, uh, Jan drove him
to the train station.

And after, uh,
Simon gets dropped off,

he's sending the truck
back for you.

What?

You will meet him, uh, there.

No. (SCOFFS)

Why would he
just go without me?

He... He wouldn't do that.

Well, the truck
only had room for two.

So...

What does that mean?

That doesn't even
make any sense.

He would have told me.

Today's only train
leaves in 90 minutes.

It takes about 35 minutes
to go there and back.

So they didn't
want to waste time.

sat on his lap.

Yes, I imagined that, too,

but, you know, we...
We don't break traffic laws.

Okay?

So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

Now, Connie. There was
no room in the truck.

Yet, it is coming right back
for you. Yeah.

(CONNIE SCOFFS)
(FATHER ODD CHUCKLES)

This is bullshit.

Okay, lunch in a bit.

(FATHER ODD HUMMING)

CHRISTIAN: And how are jobs
or roles assigned?

That's based on traits
we show as kids.

Hey.
Hey. Hi. Sorry.

Um...

Simon left without Connie.

Jesus, really?
Yeah.

What a dick move.

Is she okay?
Uh, no.

She just got told.
Did she say why?

No, no.

That sucks.

On the... On the subject
of couples actually, um...

Is there ever an issue here
with incest?

Sorry, I mean, you know,
small communities.

VALENTIN: Well, the bloodlines
are very well-preserved.

So, uh, the elders
must approve mates.

Cousins can sometimes mate.

But we do respect
their incest taboo.

So we often need to invite
outside people.

(WIND WHOOSHING)

(MAN SINGING IN SWEDISH)

Excuse me. Hey.

Would you like
to help join us?

DANI: Uh...

Sure, yeah.
Come.

DANI: Do you...
Do you know, um...

Have you seen Simon anywhere?

Yes. He was
driven to the station.

Did you not say goodbye?

No. No, I didn't.

But, uh, that's okay,
that's okay.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Hi.

What are we making here?

Meat tarts!

Oh, wow.

Oh, thank you.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

(SPEAKING SWEDISH)

She said you're so beautiful.

DANI: Oh, thank you.

Um, she's so beautiful.

(WOMAN SPEAKING SWEDISH)

(ALL CHUCKLE)

We describe it
like emotional sheet music.

Hmm. What does it say?

Well, each runic letter

stands for one
of the 16 affects,

which are graded from
most holy to most unholy.

This one, for example,
is about grief.

JOSH: Hmm.

You can see
at the end, however,

we have blank pages.

This is because the <i>Rubi Radr</i>
is a work forever in progress.

Forever evolving.

We have many,
many hundreds of these.

And who decides
what gets added?

Well, uh, this iteration
is being written by Rubin.

JOSH: Uh, the disabled?

ARNE: Since birth.

He draws
and we, the elders, interpret.

You see, Josh,

Rubin is unclouded
by normal cognition.

It makes him open
for the source.

Uh, what happens
when Rubin dies?

Do you just wait
for a baby that is...

Not clouded?


Uh, Rubin was a product
of inbreeding.

All of our Oracles

are deliberate products
of inbreeding.

Can I take a photograph?

What?

Uh, a photograph?

No. Absolutely not.
Okay, sorry.

Absolutely not.

Oh, great. She's walking away.

(GIRL SPEAKING SWEDISH)

Thank you.

Thanks.
(SPEAKS SWEDISH)

(IN ENGLISH) Thanks.

Has anyone seen Connie?

I think Mark saw her earlier.

I'm sure I saw her trying out

for the sprinting
Olympics earlier.

DANI: What? Where?

Sorry, but I can say
what happened.

Her boyfriend
called the landline

from the train station
and calmed Connie down.

Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

Okay, well, that's a relief.

Why would Simon leave
without her?

I'm sure it was just
a miscommunication.

I could see you
possibly doing that.

What the hell does that mean?

Never mind.

Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

Dude, is he going to kill me?

Did you learn anything
about the <i>Rubi Radr?</i>

Oh, so now
you wanna collaborate?

Okay, thank you.

I know that one elder...
Thank you.

...gave you a glimpse of it.

Thank you.
Sorry I brought it up.

Oh, my God, dude.
What the fuck?

Is that...
What is that?

Is that a fucking pube?
Ew.

It's just a hair.

Yeah, a pubic hair.

Dude, calm down.

MARK: Why are you embarrassed?

You're not the one
giving out hair pies.

Jesus Christ. He's still
fucking lookin' at me.

Hey. You'll come with me?

What?
You'll come?

Uh...
I'll show you.

Okay, sure.

Yeah?
Yeah, great.

Um...

I'll be back. I guess
she's gonna show me.

(BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE)

Hey, can I, uh,
borrow another sleeping pill?

Yeah, sure, yeah.
Thanks.

Thank you.


JOSH: (SIGHS)
What the fuck, Mark?

What the fuck are you doing?
Close the door,

we're not supposed
to be in here.


(MAN GROANING)

(CONTINUES GROANING)

(GROANING LOUDLY)

(TRUMPET PLAYING)

Do you think Mark's
still up with that girl?

I wouldn't be surprised.

What about Josh though?

I'm honestly
not too concerned.

Wow.

We, um,

have something regretful
to announce.

This morning
the 19th Book of <i>Rubi Radr</i>

was found missing
from the Temple.

We don't want
to point fingers,

yet, we kindly ask
that whoever took it

to return it
to its original place.

You can leave it
in the Temple,

<i>which will be left unguarded,
unwatched.</i>

<i>Nobody needs to know
it was you.</i>

Where is your friend, Josh?

I know. Uh, we have no idea.

He and your other friend,

they both disappears
the same day.

You see how it looks?
Yes, obviously.

But I swear to you
we're in the dark on this.

We're just as confused
as you are.

We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

STEN: What girl?
Inge.

Yeah, but Mark
wouldn't have done this.

Josh on the other hand,

he came to bed with us

and when we woke up,
he was gone.

And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

we don't associate
as friends of his

or collaborators or anything.

We would just be
so embarrassed

to be connected to this
in any way, shape or form.

Let's hope it gets returned.

I hope so too.

I feel responsible.

Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

Yes.
Maybe you can redeem this.

You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

DANI: Oh, hi.

And, uh, Siv wants to see you
in her house.

You okay?
Mmm-hmm.

Okay.

Okay.

This is the big one.

DANI: (CHUCKLES)
Okay. Thank you.

Look into her eyes.

DANI: Mmm-hmm.

Um, can I ask
what this is exactly?

It's, um...
Tea for the competition.


And then you, glass here.
Mmm-hmm.

And then we drink it.

Okay?
Okay.

Okay.

I just have to say,

I have no idea where Josh is.

How do you feel about Maja?

About Maja?

feel about her how?

You have been approved
to mate with her.

You're an ideal

And she has
fixed her hopes on you.

I think I ate
one of her pubic hairs.

Oh.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Okay.

Okay.
What does it do?

Oh, um...

It, uh...

It breaks down your defenses

and opens you

Okay.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

You know what? Um...

Oh, no, no. You won't.

we should all be

(ULLA EXHALES DEEPLY)

SIV: On this, the day
of our deity of reciprocity,

we gather
to give special thanks

to our treasured sun.

As an offering to our father,

we will today surrender
nine human lives.

As Harga takes,
so Harga also gives.

Thus, for every
new blood sacrificed,

we will dedicate
one of our own.

That is four new bloods.

Four from Harga.

And one to be chosen
by the Queen.

Nine in all to die

and be reborn
in the great cycle.

The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

As for our end, we have two
already dedicated

and two who have volunteered.

Ingemar and Ulf.

You have brought
outside offerings.

Plus volunteering
your own bodies.

You will today be joined
in harmony with everything.

And to Pelle,
who has brought new blood

and our new May Queen,

you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

And so,
for our ninth offering,

it is traditional that
our fair Queen shall choose

between a preselected
new blood

and a specially-ordained
Hargan.


Turbeyon.

Honorable Turbeyon!
Please step forward.

And...

Christian Hughes.

These are the candidates

for the ninth
and final offering.

We patiently await
your verdict.
