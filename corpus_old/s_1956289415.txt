Thousands of miles of tunnels
run across the United States.

Abandoned subway lines, road
networks and deserted mines.

Many are no longer in use.

Put some meat on that one.

Yeah, I guess I missed
my chance to go pro.

Oh, shh...

Tell you what...

Right now, you could walk away
with a prize from the second level

or you could keep going for
a prize from the third level.

Okay, what do you think,
Addie, should we stop...

or keep going?

Don't look at me,
it's your birthday.

I want number 11.

Yeah?

That one?

Yeah.
All right.

Uh, yeah, that one.

Thanks.
You're welcome.

Yeah.

That shirt better not
give her nightmares.

In trouble for winning
my daughter a t-shirt.

Haha, that's a new one.

She was terrified
when that came on TV.

You know...

You know they're filming
something by the carousel,

you should see if they're
looking for extras.

Ahh, I need another beer.

Hm.
I can't have a beer now?

Hey, how about the Big Dipper?

Addie, do you wanna try it?

Russel, you know she's
not big enough to do that.

And I, sure as hell,
am not doing it, so.

Whac-a-Mole!

Yeah, Whac-a-Mole guy,
that's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

How many tickets?

Two tickets.
Two tickets!

Two tickets!

Hey, Addie, come to the bathroom.
I don't have to go.

Russel?

Russel.

Can you watch your
daughter, please?

I'm watchin'!

Baby, stay close, okay?

Oh, my God!

We made it!

Dad!
Why!

You guys sleep too much.

Come on, let's go.

Careful.

Hey, back to the house, first!

What, what, what?

Ew.

Come on.

You're too old.

Don't judge me.

Don't judge me.

Lil dude.

The Wi-Fi's not working.

You don't need the internet,
you got the outernet.

Good one.

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

You.
You who?

Yoo-hoo!
Open up the door!

My gosh,
what's wrong with you?

Can we get a dog?

No, we can't.

You should run
while you're here.

Jason, eat something.
Something.

What?

What's with all the attitude?

I'm sorry.

Yay! Track and field.

Whoa.

You don't want to run anymore?

You love track and field.

Eh, what's the point?

The Olympics.

I'm not gonna make it
to the Olympics, guys.

You could do anything
you set your mind to.

Can I drive while we're here?

No.
No.

Well, that's what I set
my mind to.

Where are you going, Jason?

Jason?
I'm getting something.

You need to come
and finish your food.

Sarah and Hailey drove
with parent supervision.

Yeah, well, you don't need
to know how to drive

when you're an
Olympic-caliber athlete.

My God.

You run.
You run on the sand.

Why?

Because it's harder.

Okay? No traction.

Practice on the beach,
you get on dry land,

you take off.

We're going to the beach?

Yeah.

Well, later, once we get settled.

What beach?

Santa Cruz.

Josh, Kitty and the girls
are gonna be there.

What are you doing?

It's a magic trick.

I left it here last year.

Okay, let's see it.

This thing's kinda bullshit.

Hey!

What, are we cursing
at the table now?

When you point a
finger at someone else,

you have three
pointing back at you.

What's that supposed to mean?

That's four fingers
pointing back at you.

So, what is it?

I think she has post-traumatic
stress disorder.

She wasn't in 'Nam.

Okay, she got lost.

For 15 minutes, that's...

That can be very scary.

You don't know what
happened to her.

Anything coulda happened to her.

Okay, so-so, h-how do we
get her to talk?

Look, I think we need to
encourage her to draw,

to write, to dance.

Anything to help her
tell us her story.

I just want my little girl back.

It's gonna be okay.

I need to have a smoke.

We have a summer home
by the beach

and don't go to the beach.

What about the beach right here?

What beach?

There is a beach right there.

That is not a beach.

That is a bay, that is a shore.

I'm talking about a real beach

with people and sand,
an amusement park.

There's, like,
it's crowded there, and, like...

There's weirdos at the beach...

I-I'm not going to that beach.

We're not going.

Okay, I guess
I can just cancel then.

Okay.

It just sucks, is all.

I mean,

you know, Jason really was
looking forward to it.

It's the first time we've
been back here since

Grandma died. I know it's

been pretty hard on him.

We leave before dark.

Yeah. Yes. Yes.

It's gonna be great.
You're gonna enjoy it.

Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Are you really
not gonna kiss me?

Mm-mm.

You not gon' kiss me?
Hmm?

Where's your brother?

Your brother, where is he?

I don't know.

Really.

Jason?

Baby, that's why
you can't play in here.

Didn't this happen last year?

Zora, please.

Yeah!

That's right!

What is this?

Daddy's next home, baby!

Craw Daddy!

Ha-ha!

He's kidding, right?

He is not kidding.

It's got a cassette player
and everything!

Bucket seats!

Storage compartments!

Wow.

That's right.

It's even got
one of these, baby!

Oh, I got it, I got it.

They taught me how to do this.

It veers a little to the left,
so you gotta hold on to it.

Least, I got it really cheap.

Will we all fit, though?

You know, what?

Y'all are spoiled.

Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Spoiled!

Did you know that there's
fluoride in the water

that the government uses
to control our minds?

I forgot,

nobody cares about
the end of the world.

Maybe you could just tell us
what's supposed to happen

and then we can picture it.

Maybe you could
kiss my anus, Zora.

Ew!
Whoa, whoa!

Anus isn't a cuss word.

Why are you even
talking about anuses?

Why would you say that?

I would've actually,

preferred you use a curse
word, in this case.

Mom, I can see you laughing.

I am not laughing.

Where did you even learn that?

Okay, we don't always
have to be talking.

<i>â™ª I got more Growing Pains

â™ª Five on it â™ª

â™ª Messin' with that Indo weed â™ª

What does
"I got five on it" mean?

It's about drugs.

It's not about drugs.
It's a dope song. Don't do drugs.

Jason, come on.

Get in rhythm.

<i>â™ª Whenever I can â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't need no crutch â™ª</i>

Santa Cruz!

Five minutes.

She can't even talk.

I don't why she can't talk.

What's gonna happen?

If something happened...
What's gonna happen? Okay.

She left!

My God.

Don't look.

Is he dead?
Don't look!

You gotta be kidding me.

Hey!

Hey, what's up?

I thought you guys said 2:30.
Where's the efficiency?

Wilsons, you know
we take our time.

Hey!
Oh, my gosh, guys!

So big!

So pretty!

Becca, Lindsey!

Look who's here!

Hi!

No shit. You got the boat?
Yup, I got the boat.

Good for you, dude!
Boom!

That's fuckin' awesome.
What you get, a dinghy?

Ah, shut up.

You gotta make sure
you have the essentials.

You got the life preservers?

Got that.

You got a fire extinguisher?
Got that.

You have a flare gun?

Ernngh!

I knew you'd fuckin'
forget the flare gun.

You sure you don't
want anything to drink?

Oh, no, I'm good.
They're delicious.

Uh-huh, I'm sure, yeah.

You guys have a good
summer, so far?

Yeah, it's been great.

You good?

Yeah.

What?

I have a hard time just...

you know, talking.

Oh, I get that.

Yeah. No, I totally get that.

You guys, uh, want somethin'?

Got a full bar here.

No, all good. Water.

You want thirds, huh?

Thank you.
Okay.

Gotta get my wife
her medicine.

It's beautiful, isn't it?

Here you go.

Uh-uh.

What do we say?

"I hate you?"

That works.

Yeah? Good.

Never stops.

I think about murdering
him sometimes.

So nothing's changed, huh?
Nope.

Ooh, actually...

A little something has changed.

Oh, my God.

Did you get something done?

Just, like, an itsy-bitsy little-
little thing.

Oh, God.

Well, you look just like
you did last year.

Oh, thank you.

Well, I mean, that's
the idea, you know.

Just a little bit
can go a long way.

Not that you need anything,

whore.

What was it?

Just a stupid tunnel.

Ugh, destroyed such baby shit.

Your brother's so weird.

He just has
a hard time focusing.

Are you going in the water?

No.

Why not?
Yeah, why not?

Hey, where are you going?

To the bathroom.

Why don't you pee in the ocean?
Why don't you pee in the ocean?

Jinx.
Jinx.

Double jinx.
Double jinx.

Triple jinx.
Triple jinx.

Blackout.
Blackout.

Shut up.
You shut up.

Did you ever wish
you'd kept dancing?

Sometimes, yeah.

'Cause you were, like,
really good, right?

Yeah, well...

I peaked at 14.

Oh, I mean, didn't we all?

I think I could have been
a movie star.

If the girls hadn't been born
at exactly the wrong time.

I went to Stella Adler.

I was on two commercials
before I met Josh.

San Francisco was
a career killer.

Jesus! Watch it!

Uck.

That's crazy.

Been having so many crazy
coincidences lately.

Jason!

Jason!
Jason!

Where were you?
I went to the bathroom.

No! You don't do that.

You don't run off
without telling me.

Ow.
I'm sorry.

Okay, okay, we're all good.
We're good. All right.

I think we're gonna head out.

Yeah.
Okay?

You saw their new car, right?

He had to do it.

He just had to get that
thing to fuck with me, too.

That's mission accomplished.

Don't run inside!

Way to freak Mom out.

I'm gonna go say goodnight.

<i>11-11 tied in the 7th inning.</i>

You good?

I'm just gonna watch the
Giants highlights, okay?

I'll see you later
in the magic room.

Night, night.
Good night.

Phone off.

Mask off.

You thought I was dead.

Oh, no, I just...

I just didn't know
if you were lost, or

taken or...

By terrorists and perverts?

Stick with me.

I'll keep you safe, okay?

Look.

11:11.

Bedtime.

Who's this?

I was thinking about getting
some fishing gear tomorrow.

Four rods, we could all go,
fish off the dock.

You know?

Of course,
there's the boat, too.

I'm just sayin',

if we could get out there
in open water...

I'm not trying to force anyone.

Hey.

Gabe, I wanna go.

Where you tryin' to go?

I can't be here, I...

It's too much.

You serious?

Being here, it, um...

It feels like
there's this, um...

black c-cloud just

hanging over me and, uh...

I don't feel like myself.

I think you look like yourself.

Okay, yeah.

When I was a kid,

I went to that boardwalk
with my parents.

I wandered off.

I don't know why, I just did.

I ended up in that
hall of mirrors.

There was another girl in there.

She looked like me.

Exactly like me.

You were in the hall of mirrors...

She wasn't a reflection.

She was real.

She was real.

Sh-She...

I ran as fast as I could.

My whole life, I've...

I've thought that
she's a devil coming for me.

Okay, well, whatever happened

happened a-a long
time ago, right?

You know, how sometimes
things line up?

Yeah.
You know, like, coincidences?

Since we've been here,
they've been happening

more and more.

I think...

I feel like it means,
like, she's getting closer.

Who?

The mirror girl?

You don't believe me.

I-I-I do.

I do.

I'm processing, okay?

It's just...

I can't believe you

kept all this inside you
so long.

You know I'm here, right?

I'm pretty sure
I can kick your ass

so if she looks like
you, then...

Okay, bad joke.

All right, I'm sorry.
My bad.

I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

Shit.

We lost power.

Perfect timing.

See, this is why Josh
has a backup generator.

Jesus!

Okay, we lost power,
go back to bed.

There's a family in our driveway.

There is not a family
in our driveway.

Huh.

Who is that?

It's a family.

Y'all scared of a family?

The boogeyman's family

Okay, all right, enough-
enough of that.

Uh-uh.

Hey, hey, hey.
No.

What?

Zora, gimme your phone!

I'm not on it.
Zora!

Is someone outside?

It's just a family standing outside.

It's probably the neighbors.

You're kidding me, right?

Hello, my name is Adelaide Wilson.

Are you seriously calling
911 right now?

Hurry up?
We lost power.

All right, sure, okay.

Yes.
You know what?

What?
I'm gonna fix this.

No, we don't...
I'll find out

What?
Who they are.

No, they haven't
but I know they're gonna...

Everything's gonna be fine.
Calm down, okay?

No, no, no, that's too long!

No! You don't understand.

How about we all
just try to keep calm?

Gabe...
Dad...

Keep our heads and everything's
gonna be all right.

Don't... w-w-wait, just one second.
Gabe!

Can't I have a vacation

and my whole family lost
their goddamn minds.

Hi.

Can I help you?

Okay.

If y'all out here
trying to scare people,

I think you picked the
wrong house for that.

Zora.

Put your shoes on.

Aight. I asked you nice.

Now, I need y'all
to get off my property.

Okay, let's call the cops.

I did.

They're 14 minutes away.

What? 14 minutes?

Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

Jason, give me the bat.

What bat?

The baseball bat, the bat!
There's one in the corner.

Here.
Thank you.

Gabe.
All right, hold on.

Let's just try this again.
Gabe.

No, no, no, no, no.

All right.

Gabe!
I got this, I got this.

Now, I thought I already done
told y'all to get off my property!

Okay? So if y'all wanna get crazy,

we can get crazy!

Now, the cops
are already on their way.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey!

They're going around.

Is the back door open?

Back door's open.
Zora, no!

Gabe, Jason!

Now, I'm serious, man!

I will break your heads!

If I were you...

Gabe!

The key!
What?

The hide-a-key!
Hide-a-key?

Hide-a-what, shit!

Shit!

Oh, my God.

Just stay close.

What's going on?

What?

It's us.

We don't have anything here.

This is our summer home,
Gabe.

We just got in today, so...

Once

upon

a time,

there was a girl.

And the girl had

a shadow.

The two

were

connected.

Tethered together.

When the girl ate,

her food was given to her

warm

and tasty.

But when the shadow was hungry,

she had to eat rabbit

raw

and bloody.

On Christmas,

the girl received wonderful toys.

Soft and cushy.

But the shadow's toys
were so sharp and cold.

They'd slice through her fingers
when she tried to play with them.

The girl

met a handsome prince

and fell in love.

But the shadow,

at that same time,

met Abraham.

It didn't matter
if she loved him or not.

He was tethered to the
girl's prince, after all.

Then, the girl
had her first child.

A beautiful baby girl.

But the shadow

she gave birth to
a little monster.

Umbrae was born laughing.

The girl had a second child.

A boy this time.

They had to cut her open

and take him from her belly.

The shadow had to do it all

by itself.

She named him Pluto.

He was born to love fire.

So you see, the shadow

hated the girl

so much

for so long.

Until one day,

the shadow realized

she was being tested

by God.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

What do you want?

You could have my wallet.

You could have the car.

Gabe.

You could have the boat,
for all I care.

Nobody wants the boat, Dad.

How 'bout this?

You take me to the ATM...

What are you people?

We're Americans.

Tether yourself to the table.

Addie, don't do it.

Maybe I should cut

something off of you.

It's... It's okay.

Don't hurt my children.

Yo.

Hey, hey, hey! No!

Stop, please.

Get off me, man!

Gabe!
Daddy!

Please, please, please!
Stop!

Stop, please!

Gabe!

Wait! Wait!

Okay.

Okay.

Mom.

Little girl.

Run!

Go.

You want me, right?

He's not going.

Careful.

He has a te-emper.

No, no, no, no, no, no. Not.

Oh, shit.

Okay.

Don't be scared.

Look at me.

You're gonna be okay.

Show him one of your tricks.

Okay.

Go play, boys.

Don't burn our house down.

Stop.

Please, stop.

Stop it!

Please, no, no!

What the fuck?

Get off my car!

Come here!

Come... goddammit,
get your ass over here!

I said, come here.

Kid, I'm talkin' to you.

What do you want?

What?

What do we want?

We want

to take our time.

We've been waiting for this day

for so long!

I call it

the Untethering.

That's yours.

It hangs to the left.

It hangs to the goddamn left.

Jason?

Jason?

Come here.

It's your dad! Run!

Hey!

Come on, come on, come on.

Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go!

Josh, what was that?

What?

I heard something outside.

Okay.

Rustling.

Walking, like a person.

There's a person walking
outside our fucking house.

Could be a squirrel.
I don't know.

Would you please
get up and look?

I'm busy. I'm...

I'm busy.

So.

Maybe it's a-a pizza guy.
Maybe the girls ordered pizza.

Get up and take a look,
I'm scared.

Aw, I don't want to.
I wanna stay down here.

I wanna just stay in my cozy spot.

Get up and look.

Jesus Christ.

Hey, uh, Ophelia, lights up.

<i>Lights up.</i>

I think I heard the backup
generator go on, too.

What do you know about
the backup generator?

Can you stop being an asshole
for two seconds? Just look.

All right, I'm lookin'.

With my binoculars.

I see nothing.

I see beautiful stars.

Are you really looking?

Yeah, I'm looking.

Oh, shit, no. Yeah, I...

There's somethin' out there.

Don't fuck with me, Josh.

I'm not fucking with you.
I'm serious.

There's something out there.

Look. Look behind the car.

Where? I don't see it.

By the car! Look.
I can't...

Ho, shit!

What?

Oh, my God, it's OJ.

It's OJ Simpson!

What is wrong with you?

Seriously?

Ophelia, gimme some Beach Boys.

<i>- Playing "Good Vibrations"</i>
Really?

<i>- By The Beach Boys.</i>
Why not?

It's our last night here.
Let's have a little party.

Ophelia, turn it down.

<i>Turning down "Good Vibrations"</i>

<i>- by The Beach Boys.</i>
Would you chill out? All right?

There's nobody out there.

Just go back upstairs.
I'll be up in a few minutes.

Everything's gonna be fine.

What's going on?
Ugh.

Uh, nothin'.

Nothing, guys.
Jesus.

The backup generator
went on, we're just

trying to figure it out.
Go back to sleep.

Just because we're in our rooms
doesn't mean we're sleeping.

Fine. I don't know.
Go back to your rooms.

Guys, we have to be outta here
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, sharp, so.

<i>â™ª 'Cause I feel like it! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just sit your ass on the curb
and shut the fuck up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Man, fuck this shit â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Aight, smart ass,
I'm takin' your black ass to jail! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª MC Ren, will you please
give your testimony â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To the jury about this
fucked up incident? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck the police!
And Ren said it with authority â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because the niggas on
the street is a majority â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A gang, is with whoever
I'm steppin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And the motherfuckin'
weapon is kept in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª A stash box,
for the so-called law â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Wishin' Ren was a nigga
that they never saw â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Lights start flashin' behind me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But they're scared of a nigga
so they mace me to blind me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But that shit don't work,
I just laugh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because it gives 'em a hint
not to step in my path â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For police, I'm sayin',
"Fuck you, punk!" â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Readin' my rights and shit,
it's all junk â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Pullin' out a silly club,
so you stand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With a fake-ass badge
and a gun in your hand â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But take off the gun
so you can see what's up â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And we'll go at it, punk,
and I'ma fuck you up! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Make you think I'ma kick your ass â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But drop your gat,
and Ren's gonna blast â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm sneaky as fuck
when it comes to crime â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But I'm a smoke 'em now
and not next time â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Smoke any motherfucker
that sweats me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Or any asshole that threatens me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Takin' out a cop or two,
they can't cope with me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The motherfuckin' villain that's mad â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With potential to get bad as fuck â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I'ma turn it around â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Put in my clip, yo,
and this is the sound â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, somethin' like that â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck tha police â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck tha police â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck tha police â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fuck tha police â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah man, what you need? â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Police, open now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We have a warrant
for Eazy-E's arrest â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Get down and put your
hands where I can see 'em! â™ª</i>

Come on!

Dammit.

No, no, please. No!

No. No. No. No! No!

No!

No! No!

No! Please! No!

No!

<i>â™ª Creep on in... on in â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª See I'm ridin' high â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoa â™ª</i>

It wasn't locked.

Um, the boats are done.

I'm done with boats.

<i>â™ª Light another joint
like Cypress Hill â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I steal doobies
Spit loogies when I puff on it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I got some bucks on it,
but it ain't enough on it â™ª</i>

I can't believe they're dead.

Why are they doing this?

<i>I'm sorry, but all of our
operators are busy at the moment.</i>

<i>Please hold and the next
available operator...</i>

It's all just craziness.

<i>But all of our operators are
busy at the moment. Please...</i>

How does 911 keep you
on hold all night long?

I just don't get it.

Too many to answer.

How many of everybody
is there gonna be?

<i>The boardwalk was
getting ready to close</i>

<i>and a bunch of us
had just gotten out</i>

<i>and we were going to our cars
when the attack happened.</i>

Oh, shit.

Don't curse.

<i>And then we just saw red.</i>

<i>- Wait, you saw red?
Yes, they were wearing red.</i>

<i>They didn't look right.
They had scissors</i>

<i>and they were just walking
up to people in the crowd</i>

<i>and stabbing them!</i>

<i>You said they were
stabbing people?</i>

<i>Yeah, it was chaos,
and then we just started running.</i>

<i>Where did they come from?</i>

<i>What? I-I-I don't know.</i>

<i>Someone said that they were
coming from the sewers.</i>

<i>The sewers?
Okay, how many are...</i>

<i>Sorry, I think they're coming.</i>

<i>Uh, ma'am?</i>

Ma'am?

<i>Um...</i>

<i>Okay, uh, so we certainly hope
everything is okay there.</i>

<i>It's too early to say
what exactly is unfolding.</i>

<i>But it does appear
we are in the midst</i>

<i>of a brutal and terrifying attack</i>

<i>by people who are being
described as wearing red,</i>

<i>carrying scissors or shears</i>

<i>and doing what can
only be described as</i>

<i>wreaking havoc on folks...</i>

And they look like us.

They don't even know that yet.

<i>Okay, Chris, I'm gonna cut you off.</i>

<i>But we have new images
coming in here.</i>

<i>Here, we see a man
wearing red, who...</i>

Okay, this...

<i>This seems to be a group
of individuals</i>

<i>engaged in some sort
of demonstration,</i>

<i>protest...</i>

<i>It's not clear at this time</i>

<i>if or how these people are
connected to the attacks.</i>

What is that?

<i>They're forming what looks
like a human chain.</i>

What are they doing?

I don't know

but that would take a
shitload of coordination.

<i>Obviously, if you have children
watching this right now,</i>

<i>to turn them away.</i>

<i>Not sure what's about to happen.</i>

We have to go.

What? You're joking, right?

Zora, Jason, help your father.

She's tripping.
Where would we go?

The police, right?
No.

We need to move and keep moving.

We take the coast.

We go to Mexico.

Mexico?

Okay.

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

We got everything we need here.

Food, water, backup generator.

We're safe here as
we're gonna be anywhere.

Tell that to Josh and Kitty.
They're right here.

You're scaring the kids.

Too late.
Too late.

They think like us.

They know where we are.

They won't stop
until they kill us.

Or we kill them.

Then, let's make some
traps or somethin',

like some Home Alone type stuff.

That way, if she comes...

Tell me you did not just
reference Home Alone.

You know what I'm talkin' about.

Gabe,

they've been planning this.

They have the upper hand.

This is the time to run,

not to be sprinkling Micro
Machines on the floor.

What are Micro Machines?
What's Home Alone?

We're not going anywhere.
And that's final.

You don't get to make
the decisions anymore!

So,

does this mean we get their car?

Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

Who's got the keys?

Get in the car, get in the car.

I'm driving.
No way.

I told her, no.

Dad's leg is messed up.
You're handcuffed.

It's not safe. I'm driving.

Zora!
No.

I have the highest
kill count in the family.

You don't have the
highest kill count.

I killed both twins.

Wrong.
I just killed the second one.

I killed Kitty.

So that's one, one, one,
and two.

I killed two.
I killed myself and Josh, so.

It doesn't matter.

Zora, get in the back.
Look!

Oh, shit, put the windows
up, put the windows up,

put the windows up!

Okay,

you're gonna want to

back up.

Buckle up.

Huh?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Where is she?
Did I get her?

She's there! She's there!

Jesus!

Zora!

Careful.

You're going too fast!

She's dead now, right?

What are you doing?

Mom!
Where's she going?

And she left.

Your mom left the car.

Whoa.

Is that our car?

It's followed who looks like me.

Shit.

Stay in the car.
Lock the doors.

What is she doing?

It's a trap.

Get out!

Please.

No.

No!

Jason!

Jason?

Jason!

Jason!

No!

Adelaide!

Here.

What do we got here?

Probably got bandages and stuff.

Your mom knows what to do.

Look.

It's the line.

Looks like some kind of
fucked up performance art.

Where is he?

How it must have been

to grow up with a sky.

To feel the sun,
the wind, the trees.

But your people
took it for granted.

We're human too, you know.

Lives.

Gave them hands, blood.

Exactly like you.

And yet,

it was humans

that built this place.

I believe

they figured out how to
make a copy of the body

but not the soul.

The soul remains one
shared by two.

They created the Tethered

so they could use them to
control the ones above.

Like puppets.

But they failed

and they upended the Tethered.

For generations,

the Tethered continued
without interactions.

They all went mad down here.

And then

there was Addie.

Put some meat on that one.

Yeah, I guess I missed
my chance to go pro.

You remember?

We were born special.

I want number 11.

Yeah?

Addie, you wanna try it?

God brought us
together that night.

I never stopped
thinking about you.

How things could have been.

How you could have
taken me with you.

Years after we met,

the miracle of life.

That's when I saw God.

And He showed me my path.

You felt it, too.

The end of our dance.

The Tethered saw
that I was different.

That I would deliver
them from this misery.

I found my faith.

And I began to prepare.

It took years to plan.

Everything had to be perfect.

I didn't just need to kill you.

I needed to make a statement

that the whole world would see.

It's our time now.

Our time up there.

And to think,

if it weren't for you,

I never would've danced at all.

My baby!

My baby!

Oh, God.

Look, look.

They're all gone now.

They can't hurt you.

You understand?

Everything's gonna be
like it was before.

She wasn't in 'Nam.

Okay, she got lost.

For 15 minutes, that's...

That could be very scary.

You don't know what
happened to her.

Anything coulda happened to her.
Okay, okay.

So, h-how? How do we
get her to talk?

Encourage her to draw,

to write, to dance.

Anything to help her
tell us her story.

I just want my little girl back.

She left!

I told you to look after her.

Yeah. Yeah.

Look at you.
It's not my fault she left.

Look at you.

It's not my fault she...
Look at me. Look at you.

Look at you.

â™ª Will somebody wear me to the fair? â™ª

â™ª Will a lady pin me in her hair? â™ª

â™ª Will a child find me by a stream? â™ª

â™ª Oooh â™ª

â™ª Kiss my petals â™ª

â™ª And weave me through a dream â™ª

â™ª For all of these simple things
and much more â™ª

â™ª A flower was born â™ª

â™ª It blooms to spread love and joy â™ª

â™ª Faith and hope to people forlorn â™ª

â™ª Inside every man â™ª

â™ª Lives the seed of a flower â™ª

â™ª If he looks within â™ª

â™ª He finds beauty and power â™ª

â™ª Ring all the bells
sing and tell the people â™ª

â™ª Everywhere that the flower has come â™ª

â™ª Light up the sky with your
prayers of gladness â™ª

â™ª And rejoice
for the darkness is gone â™ª

â™ª Throw off your fears
let your heart beat freely â™ª

â™ª At the sign that a new time is born â™ª
