Excuse me? Excuse me?
Is it train late?

Hi, I'm here for a temp job.
Mr. Mahoney was in the hallway.

Excuse me, are you Mr. Mahoney?
Yeah.

Hi, my name is Janice ..
The temp From 'Permanent Temps'

Sorry I'm late. The train was...
What size jacket then?

Ahhh... Small.
Small says the late girl.

You could put that on.

Okay... See this door? The lock is broken.
Want stay locked.

On the matter, there's nothing inside
but an empty closet, see that?

Yeah.

Empty. But maintenance can't fix it until tomorrow.
So, I need you to stand here.

Well, if anybody comes down here, anybody gets lost,
and starts wondering around,

I need you to make sure they don't open this door.
Okay.

Like a guard dog, you block them. Got it?
Yeah.

The jacket is way too big.
I know.
Way too big.

If you got here on time, you could get a smaller size.
The smalls are the first to go.

I apologize.
That doesn't matter.

Nobody comes down here anyway

Get to work!

O, ticket one, please.

Hello?
You're late.

For what?
Tim?! We said no stilts inside.

Late for what?
For my work party.

You didn't say anything about the work party.
Yes, I did.

Do I have to go?
Yes

Shit!

I told you, it is going to be in suits. What did I say?
Can you at least take the hat off?

Hi, .. heh.

I have a bonus.
Really? Again?

S-Class 500, black, leather,
Fully loaded.

Great. Beautiful car.

May I ask for a whiskey, please?
See who just ---- to the party.

I got a new plasma TV,
How many inches?
50-inch, Full HD, surround everything.

You watch porn on it?
Oh, hey dude, when I was watching this one

This bitch is wearing this little bikini, and a zit on her ass is like this big.
In High Def? So raunchy.

Hey man, there's a lady right here, so?
OK, buddy.

So the 50-inch size, how much that costs you?
Like 3 grand.
Not bad...

You're kidding, right?
Excuse me?
3000 dollars for TV? Ever heard about books?

No, we did not have those at Harvard.
Tim, can we talk for a second?

Pauline, who is this guy?
He was joking. Sorry.

No, I'm not kidding.

Hey, what's that on your neck? What is the makeup?
Yes, makeup, silver makeup.

The dude wears makeup.
Bye bye.

We need to have a talk, Janice.

About what?
Honestly, I don't think this is working out too well.

What do you mean?
We got a lot of complaints about you.

What kind of complaints?
Just complaints, people who are not happy.

Do you want me to read you some?
Let's see...

"She seems distracted and disinterested".

"Her heart is not in it and her head in the clouds."

"Sometimes she reminds me of a speak and spell."
Do you have any idea that that means?

It does not matter. The point is we pride ourselves here on reputation
for smart, reliable and hardworking temps, ok?

I am reliable, George.
Hang on, let me finish.

You're reliable. And yes, you are a nice person,
but you do not personable.

What do you mean?
What do I mean?

Have you ever seen "Three's Company"?
The TV show?

You know Janet, the roommate?
She is an example of what I'm talking about.

She has a lot of charisma.
I mean, people want to see her again and again.

That's why show is lasted so long
I mean, I watched it every night.

So that you saying is that you want me to be more like
Janet from "Three's Company"?

I mean I'm saying that, but I'm not really saying that.
Because that I'm really saying is, you know, you're fired.

That's what I'm actually saying.
You're fired.

Ok.

Hi, I' m calling about the job listening in a paper today. Really?

Okay, thank you.

Hello, Janice. Got a second?
Sure, Craig.

The rent is due on the first.
I know.

Really? Because your rent is usually arrives in my box around the 20th,
 and that won't work.

I know, I'm sorry, Craig. I'm trying.
Look, times are tough .. I get it, ok ..

.. but there are certain facts of live we all have to live by.

Why is the rent due on the first day of the month?
Bits me, it's just work out that way, you know?

Someone invented months and someone invented rent.

And then someone decided that rent is due on the first day of that month.

Sorry that sounds harsh.
No, I understand... I'll figured it out.

Thank you.
Okay

There.

Hi, I'm Hal Baker, I have a segment on night news called
"Man on the street".

Anyway
I'm wondering if you be interested in being interviewed?

Hello? Ah, right...
Give him some money.

Interested?

Okay, here, give me a call.
Thanks.

Hey, I got some good news.
Okay, listen to this,

Today this guy, I'm downtown .. slow day ..
It is not important ..

The point is I'm gonna be on TV.

Did you hear me? I'm gonna be on the TV show,
I'm gonna be on a TV show.

I thought you hate TV.
Yes, I do, but not this kind.

What kind?
This is education, is on the news.

Okay.
Wow.

I'm trying to contain your enthusiasm, Pauline.

What's up, Mark?
Tim, you all silver.

I'll be right there.

What your brother doing here?

I'm leaving you, Tim.

What? Are you coming back?
No

You leaving?
Where is your suitcase?

I do not need a suitcase. This is not a movie.
I do not understand.

I'm seek of it, Tim I'm seek of the robot.

I'm seek of the struggle.
This again. The struggle is a part of the art, Pauline.

Van Gogh never sold a painting.
Tim, you're not a Van Gogh, okay?

I'm not saying I am an artist,
but people called me an artist.

You know what?
I do need a suitcase.

If it looks like a duck and
it acts like a duck, then it is a duck.

What's a duck?
I am a duck.
What are you talking about?

If it's quack, has wet feet and feathers
then it is a duck.

What are you talking about? - I'm talking about me.
But I'm not see, I'm talking about us.

I'm talking about leaving and you
talking about ducks.

Because I thought you believed in me.
I never believed in you, Tim.
I just thought it was charming.

I'll be in my car.

Hey ..
What a hell is going on out there?

Can I give you some advice, man to man,
Do you mind?
Because I really like you.

But you know that I see when I looked at you?
You are 30-something, you poor,

my sister is leaving you,
you got no real future to speak up

And you know why that is?
Look, I will tell you why that is.

Because people are not live like this

Painted like a metal guy.

There's a reason the entire population
gets up in the morning and clocks the freeways,
 because they gotta go to work.

That is a part of life and always has been.
You are a farmer.

Whether you like it or not, you're a farmer
and you have got to plow the fields.

What fields?
You know what I saying.

You think I want to sit behind a desk,
in a little room and push a pencil around the papers all day?

Hell no! But I do it.
Why?

You know the song by The Little River Band,
'Have your heard about the lonesome loser"?

Great song.
Well, Tim, if you're not careful, I gonna end like the guy in that song.

You are a farmer who plowed the fields.

Hello?
Where are you, Janice?
Hi, Jill.

Are you coming over? Hold on, hold on...
I know. We run out of dip.

Janice? - Yes
Did you hear me? I say we run out of dip.

I didn't know you're talking to me.
What?
I said I did not know you are talking to me!

What does that mean?
I thought you are talking to someone else at the party.

I'm talking to you, I called you, Janice.
No, I know, but...
Jesus Christ, Janice. Are you even listening?

We ran out of sauce for the chips
We have no more dip!

Okay, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry, just bring some more dip.

I'll pay you back, do not worry, you're coming, right? Jenice?
Yes, I'm coming!

Great, okay, just bring some more dip, and I will...

Why did you ring the door bell?
I do not know.

So weird. Just walk in.

You bring the dip?
Yes
Hi, Janice.

Honey, you have got to come to listen to the Larry story.
Okay, will be there in a minute.
Hi Brian.

I want you to meet someone.
What? No, I do not want to ..

I wasn't planning to stay, because I'm not feeling right.
You fine.
No, I'm really...

All right, let's go.
No, I'm not feeling well...

Just take off your jacket.
Stop it!

Doug, this is my sister I was telling you about.

Hi, Jill sister.
All right, you two have fun.

Hi, I'm Doug Duncan.
Hi, I'm Janice.

That's a really pretty sweater that you have on.
Is that wool?

I do not know.
Feels like wool.

Is it itchy? - Not really.
I've got once a wool sweater, it was really itchy.

I almost wear it when I was flying to London
First class, for book signing.

I am a author.
Oh, okay.
Well, I guess they flew first class for this sort of thing, you know...

But I am lucky I'm not wear this sweater because
when I got there right from the airport

to a live interview at the BBC.

It's the British Broadcasting Company.
Right.

Anyway, what do you do?
I .. I do not know really how to answer ..

Corporation, sorry.
British Broadcasting Corporation. I always do that.

But it was tough, you know, it was like 3 hours, and if had I worn the wool sweater.
I'd be like, you know, itchy much.

But this is serious, you can't be itchy on camera
It's like the big no-no.

Do you have any hobbies? One of my hobbies is
helping kids.

Blind kids, build a church.

Residents on the southern side is find themselves knee deep in sewage

after a pipe broke near the corner of
Washington Boulevard and Main Street

Officials shut down the Washington corner
to fix the problem.

And we were told that construction could keep
the road closed through the New Year.

That gonna make a rough for some of our commuters.
But let's hear Hal Baker, our Man on the street.

To actually is on the street today.He's in the studio, Hal?
That's right, John. Thank you.

Some of you may have seen my next guest out on the street
some afternoon and wondered "Who, the heck, is that guy?"

We're here to find out. His name is Tim Tucker
And he is known as the "The Giant Mechanical Man"

Hi, Tim
Hi.
That quiet a nice outfit you got there.

Thanks, I have sort of refinding it over the years.

That brings me to my first question.
Why did you choose to start doing this robot thing?

Why I choose to do it . This is happens to be my talent.

Interesting.
And I feel like...

And also maybe the people would, you know,
brighten people's life up.

What do you mean?
I guess, I think that modern life can be an alienating.

And It can be like you mindlessly
walking through it, like a robot.

And you can feel lost.

I guess I just want people to know that they are not crazy, okay?

Everybody at home, everybody watching the show today,
you're not crazy, I mean life is crazy, right?

Maybe if you see A Giant Mechanical Man, you know,
 wondering down the street, towards you.

Maybe that could put it in perspective everything.

You know?
You know that could be good for your routine? Break-dancing.
Break-dancing?

Like the wave. Can you do the wave?

No, I don't do that. I don't do the wave.
You know what I mean, the wave.

Yes, I know what that is, I just don't do it.
Right. Right. Do you know the moonwalk?

Here it goes.

That is not what I'm trying to say.
I am not do that sort of stuff, the wave, the moonwalk.
I'm not that kind of...

Are you sure? That's fun!

Alright. Are we done?

Hello?
Hi, Jill. Listen, I need a place to stay for a little while.

Why? Do you get evicted or something?
Yeah, I might...

Might? Where are you calling from?
I phone a pay phone.

I've been trying to call you.
What happen to your sell phone?

It got turned off.
What? How did that happen?

I'm just...I'm having hard time right now, Jill.
What's the matter, Janice?

I just need a place to stay for a while, okay?
Yeah. okay. That's fine. You can stay here. We come pick you tomorrow.

Okay, thanks.

Hi, I saw you on television.

Hi, I saw you on television.

I feel like 'those people' you're talking about.

Like I was just born into this life and
 I supposed to know that I'm doing.

Like I'm supposed to have it all figured it out.
But I don't have it all figured it out.

I just feel lost.

Anyway, thanks.

Oh God, did you guys know that Bianca Jones and Lee
Dermot broke up?

Oh God, you know who else is breaking up?

Joe Lorrie and Ashley Seib.

Okay.

I'm gonna get more coffee.

So, we have something for you.
A little welcome gift, I guess.

I think, you are really going to like it.
Oh my God, it's like the coolest gift ever.

What is it?
It's something that is one of the kind.

Totally, totally unique.
Wow, what's it?

Guess.
What?

Guess. I mean you will never guess, but just try to guess.
Okay, while you want me to guess...

Is it a hat?
A hat?

I do not know.
It is definitely not a hat.

Why did you guess that? Why?
I do not know, you said to guess...

No really, I mean, Janice. Please, once, for once in your
 life just take yourself seriously, alright?

Your life is upside down and is in shambles
and you guess a hat?

I'm taking it seriously.
Maybe we need just give it to her.

Fine. just give it to her.
Close your eyes.

Alright.

It is this.

Oh, it's a book.
Yes, Doug Duncan. Remember him from the party?

Yes.
I clean his teeth, Janice.

He want us to give it to you.
And he even sign it on the inside. Open it!

What is this say?

"Dear Janice, how about we discuss over dinner? Doug Duncan".

Isn't that awesome?
You should definitely go out with him, Janice.
Absolutely.

I mean this is the answer, you know? He's amazing. He'll teach you how to talk, because sometimes nobody get it that.

Thank you.

Well, I have got an opening in sanitation.
Sanitation?

Yeah. it's pretty simple. You just clean up the cages, take out the trash, kid drops his popcorn, you clean it up.

Does it bother you?
No, I'm used to it.

Good, the other downside is that you'll need to clean the toilets too.

That's all is clean the toilets, at this point.

I'm sorry to heard that. Okay, then, why don't we just get you your uniform, give you a broom, and you'll be on your way.

Okay.
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

Excuse me?

Excuse me?
Yes?

You work here?
Do I work here?

No, I'm trapped here.

What?
Miserable human being.

That's that they call us exhibit.

I'm looking for an employment office.
I just looking for my coin.

The employment office is right down there, pass the monkeys on the right.
You can't miss it.

Thanks.

Hey...

Okay, I mean you're over
 qualified for the job, but if you desperate, I can give you that.

I'm desperate.
Okay then.

Just one.
Hi.

Thank you.

Hi there.
Hi.

I think I saw you yesterday, I was cleaning the fountain?

Yes, they let you out?
No, I escaped.

So, looks like you got the job.
Yes.

What do you do?
I sell this little plastic gorillas with grape juice.

Yes, I've cleaned up a lot of those.

Hopefully it's just temporary,
until I figured out my life.

I get it.

It's depressing, right?
What do you mean?

I mean, human being evolved over billions of years...

From scratch, stood up, made fire, build shelter, invented a wheel.

For what? So you can stand with the funny hat
and selling grape juice gorillas?

Kinda try not to think about that like that.

I'm sorry.

Do not worry, you not the only one whose
 try to figured out their lives.

"How to have Win..."
"Winning Conversation".

Winning Conversation? Okay...

We having one right now.
My sister gave it to me.

And it good?
I do not know.

I guess, I'm having dinner with the author, so
I figured I should you know, read it.
Right.

Alright, well, I got ot get back to the work.

I'll see you again, Janice.
See you later.

Watch up, the polar bear.

Hi, what's in the gorillas?
Some kind of sugar drink?

It's grape juice
Want a grape juice, honey?
I want to grape juice.

No, just one, how much are they?
Six dollar.

Well, alright, just one.

Thank you.
Ok, hold on.

You said this was
grape juice, lady. It's not a grape juice.

It isn't?
No, it's grape drink, I want my money back.

Can I have it, daddy?
No, you can't, honey.
But I want it! - Too much sugar, I'm sorry.

Gosh, Indian giver.
Where did you hear that?

Thanks a lot, lady.
I'm sorry.
Bla-bla I'm sorry...

You need to get a live.

What are you doing in here, Janice? I'm really busy,
I'm trying to close a deal downtown.

I could do that, George.
No, damn it, no. Come on, don't do this, Janice.

Do not make me feel guilty.
I told you this is not the job for you.

Please, George, I need to pay my rent.
We all need to pay rent, Janice.

We just.... What is the matter with you?
Nothing.

Why you do that thing with your mouth?
Nothing, George. I just need to pay my rent.

What the hell, your teeth, Janice, They falling all out of your mouth!
I do not know what's happening to me, George.

All your teeth fall out of your face!

Good morning, Janice.

You missed a spot.

What?
You missed a spot.

I did? Where?
No, I was just joking.

What? What did I miss?

No-no. I was just joking. I was just making a joke.

Oh, I've missed a spot.
That's funny.

I don't know, maybe it's not.
No, it's hysterical, it's really funny.

He just poked the monkey!
What?

That guy.
How would he like if someone did that to him?

I'm gonna find out. Common. Hey! Hey!
What?

Do not poke the monkey, man.
Chill out, I'm not hurting.

I saw that you did, you pocked him.
I did not poke the monkey. Nice hat.

Yes, you did. How would you like if someone poked you?
Do you wanna poked me?

No, but I'm gonna pokes you, you asshole.
Yeah, but you like that.

-There, how you like it? You like it?
Go Janice!

Like that! Like that!

Don't poke the monkey!

Are you okay?

Yes. He was poking the babies.
I know, I know. I loved that.

Do not poke the fucking monkeys!

Did you see his face? He was freak out.
I loved that you grab it out of my hand.

He was totally freak...
Do not poke monkey, don't poke the monkey!

Do you think we gonna get fired?
No.
I can't afford to get fired.

We will be alright.
We need to rearrange that habitat or it just happen again.
You should tell her that.
I know.

Well, first of all, you guys are better that a security team.

But second ..
Sonia, look, if you gonna fire anyone, fire me, okay?

I started it. Jenice should not be fired.
I'm not going to fire anybody.

Look, between you and I,
I'm glad you guys stand up for the monkey.

But in the future, lets just call security, okay?

Okay
Okay.

I think Janice has a suggestion.

Tell the thing that you just tell me.

What is it?

Well... It's just that...
Right now the way that habitat is arranged...

people can get right up to the rail, which is right there the monkey sleep.

If we move the rail back or put in a tree
or something to give the monkey more privacy.

It would be just better, because when people
see a sleeping monkey, they start yell at it.

She's right. Some of this people are just wrack.
We need to protect the animals better.

Especially the babies.
I did not realize that they are so exposed.

It's wide open.
We gonna get fix that, then.

I'll call the habitat coordinator.
Thanks, Janice.

You're welcome.

Nice,

Webster's Dictionary defines the word 'conversation' as
as the oral exchange of ideas

opinions and observations.

Hi, I'm Doug Duncan, Thank you so much for

allowing me to be your tour guide today through
"conversation-nation"

Are you all ready to go on your tour or what?

Thank you. In order to have a meaningful conversation,
you gonna have that?

What do you need?

A desire to speak.

But in order to have a desire to speak,
 you need to have something to say

Where do we find these things?
Where are this things to say?

In your giant oversize purse, miss?
I do not think they are.

But look.

How about this handsome gentleman, here?
What is your name, sir?

Toby.
Ok, Toby, would you be willing to be my volunteer

in a little experiment, I'm gonna do today?

Sure.
You say that now, Toby, but just wait...

Just kidding. Common up here, Toby.
Toby, have you ever been on a date?

Once or twice.
Ok, what you guys talk about?
Just stuff. you know, stuff like that.

"Just stuff. you know, stuff like that."
Wow... sounds fascinating.

But seriously, Toby. That's why you are here today.
To learn the art of eloquence.

Now, I want you all to pretend
that I'm a beautiful woman.

And me and Toby here are on a date.
What do you want to talk about Toby?

Common Toby!
I do not know.

Okay, I want you to sit. Rule â„–1, people.
Stack the deck in your favor.

If you do not know what to talk about,
talk about yourself.

KEEP TALKING. D.D.

How are you?
Okay.
Good to hear.

Hi Doug.
Hey.

Sorry, this things just go so nuts.
You are great up there.

You are really good, Doug.
Jill, thank you, I really appreciate that compliment.

Hey Janice.
Hi Doug.

Have you had a chance to read my book?
Yeah, it's good.

I mean I've only read just a little bit of it,
 but it's good.

Well, the dinner is still stands.
Okay.

How about tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night?

Yes, she would love to.
Fantastic, wow! Okay.

Guys can have some "Winning conversations"?

Well, duty calls.
Thank you for the tickets.

You're great.

What we got here? Toby!
I was really impressed with your growth today.

Doug is perfect for you.
Perfect.

I mean, your life was been on pause, for so many years.
I just feel like it's time for you to push the play button.

What is that saying?
Which one?
You know about two kinds of people

There are two different kinds of people in the world.
There those who...

Something. Something...
They carry...
Never mind.

It's basically, there two kind of people in this world. And you don't want to end with the wrong kind.

We just try to help you, Janice.
We're on your team, Janice.
Your team, Janice.

Team that pays the bills.

Hey, Janice! Hey!

You left your book in a break room.
Oh, thanks.

I didn't get a chance to read it, but I did see the author
 picture and he...

Kinda look like a cheese ball, right?
Yes.

Look, I'm sorry for getting all "Charles Darwin" in the arctic castle.
That nonsense about the swamp and...

It wasn't nonsense.

It's kinda was.
I don't know it made sense

Did it?
I mean to me it did, cause I've no idea that I'm doing.

I mean, I have no clue.

No clue what I'm doing.
Neither do I.

But I'm talking about my life, I
do not want to sell grape juice gorillas.

Or go out with this cheese head, but I do not know ..
So, then why are you?

Why am I what?
Why are selling grape juice gorillas?

Because, what else would I gonna do?
I need a job.

I get it.

And I'm...

I'm actually living with my sister right now.
And she kinda won't living me alone.

"What's your job, Janice?,
What are you interests?"
Exactly.

"What are you doing with your life?
What is a point of you?"
Why should anybody care about.

Yeah, you sound just like my sister.
Just like my girlfriend, actually.

Right.
Yes.

That's funny.
Yes.

So, anyway...
People... weird.

Yeah, they are.

I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay, cool.
Okay.

I meant, ex-girlfriend, by the way.

What?
When I said that, I meant to say ex-girlfriend.

I didn't even...
No-no, that's cool...

I was just...
Yeah, yeah...

There she is.

Thanks.

I've written books about, you know,
 a lot of different subjects.

You name a topic, I've written about it.
This is go ahead, pick a topic.

What do you mean?
Just pick a topic. Any topic.

Diet, conversation, health, dreams,
travel... pick a topic .. Health, dreams, travel...

Dreams.
Okay, dreams. What do you want to know about dreams?

I do not know, I was just picking a topic.

Dreams are the subconscious mind,
telling the conscious mind that it needs.

Tell me about the latest dream that you had.

Do not worry, I'm not going to judge you.
Just tell me about the latest dream that you had.

Ok, well. I was at this a job interview and my teeth started falling out.

What?
In a dream my teeth were falling out.
Holy shit, that's crazy.

I mean, you must be crazy person.. just kidding.
But seriously, that pretty messed up.

You know that, just buy my book on dreams.
It'll tell you everything you need to know.

And what is for dinner.

They have a cheesecake.

There is also this box under the bed with some letters.

This is the box.
Thank you.

You've missed a shoe.
Okay, thank you.

And some of the books.

I also want to apologize to you.
For that? You don't have to apologize.

For that I said about that I've never believed in you.

Oh, that.
It was harsh, and I'm sorry.

It's okay, I'm gonna quit that stuff anyway.

Nobody really seems to get it.
Tim, you quit, what?

No.

It's a worthless skill. It's not like I'm a piano player
 or a painter or something.

It's got no value. I get it.
I was angry when I said all that, Tim

I don't think it's true.

I know you gonna take this thing and evolve it into...

I do not know... something bigger, whatever your brain takes it,
cause you don't see the finish line.

You don't ever put that pressure on yourself.

And that's so great about you.

I am really sorry.
Why?

Because I let you down.
Because I wasn't enough.

Tim, you did not let me down. Okay?

We just grew in different directions.

But I still really like to be your friend.

You gotta get in the conversation.
You can't just knock on the door, "May I come in?"

You gotta bust right in there!
In fact. I can't believe I'm gonna tell you this.

I used to be horrible in conversations. What?
Me? I know! It's crazy.

But I'm just, you know, could talk about
the weather and stupid stuff like that.

But when I came to true emotion, expression of feelings...

The words are just get blocked.
Right in the neck area.

Not anymore, now when I want something, bang, instant words.

For instance, gosh .. I do not know...

If I want to kiss you, I'd just say
"Hey, I want to kiss you."

Simple, just like that.
I do not mean right now, we are in the restaurant.

That'd be weird plus I don't wanna seem to be to forward or anything.

But I could easily say it any moment,
so, be on a look out for that.

Let's see what is for dessert tonight.

I need whiskey?!

I did a podcast, I have twitter

I forgot my jacket, I'll be right back.

Tim
Janice, hey.

What are you doing here?
I just get a drink.

Do you want to join me?

Oh, my jacket was on a god damn bus stop.
It's like a steak sauce or something.

Doug, this is my friend Tim
What's up, bro? Cool hat.

Thanks, bro.

Alright, I'll see you tomorrow at work, right?

Okay.

Oh, look at that guy.

Fine, see you self.

I think you gonna like it.
What, Jill? What? What is the news?

Doug Duncan asked Brian about you today.
I guess he liked his date.

Oh. yeah.
Yep, and he is taking the four of us out to dinner Thursday night.
And you're not saying NO. I'm not let you say NO.

What are you doing?, Jill.
You gonna burn. Jenice,
Doug likes slim girl.

There she is.

Happy birthday. You look beautiful.
This is Janice.

Janice.
Hi.
Hey, I heard a lot about you.

Really? Wow.
That's awesome.

What's up man?
Hello, Tim

This is my friend.
Hey, what's up? I'm Wesley.

I'm Janice.
I want you to have this.

You want me to have this? Alright.

I'll take your photos.

This guy is a great photographer.
A wonderful picture.

Thanks everyone.
I am so glad you all came.

You are the best friends,
 a person could hope for.

You are like family to me.
It's true, I don't care it's sounds cheesy, It's true.

I also want to thank my wonderful man, Wesley.

He is always so supportive of me and makes me feel loved.

And it's true what they say...

It only takes one person, just one person...

... to make you feel special, valued and like you belong
in the world.

Let's have some cake!

I thought he was talking to you.
No, no, apparently he was talking to you.

I did not answer him.
No, but he was standing there, he's very close talker.

Very close.

Where were you born? Were you born here?
No, I was born in Wyoming, actually.

Wyoming? I heard good thing about Wyoming.
 It's beautiful there.

Yes, I heard that to, but I do not really remember,
because I sort of moved away when I was little.

Sorta moved away?
I am adopted, so I was adopted, basically.

Ok, what was that like?
Being adopted?

Yes.
It was weird because my little sister, Jill, was
not adopted ..

So it was kinda...I mean.. But it's fine now.

But when I was 7, I really want to grow up and moved away.

I thought growing it meant that you loose your baby teeth
 and you get your big ones.

And I read in this book that
if you tie peace of string around your tooth

and then tie the other end to a door knob you can slam the door and you baby tooth will come out.

So I tried it.
What happened? Did your teeth fall out?

No, the door slam back in to my head and I had to get 3 stitches.

Oh, shit.
It's was a bad idea.

Let me see it.
Right there.
Okay, I see.
Right above my eyebrow? Can you see it?

Yes, I get it. I like that.

Makes you look tough,
 look like you kicked ass with this stitches.

Yes. My dad would tell me to say
"You should see the door."

You know, cause...
I don't know, it's a dad joke...

Sometimes I have dreams where my teeth are falling out.

Are you serious?
I just had that dream. It freaked me out.

Do not worry.
It's common...People have it all the time, or at least the say that they say

Do you know what it means?
You know, Teeth are for chewing, for biting.

You know, they are powerful.

And they are falling out, so you feel powerless.

Okay
Yes, I have it all the time.

But you know what helps?
Apple Pie.

Really?
Makes you feel really powerful.

We should split one than.
You want to split a whole pie?
Okay.

Do you want it?
Do you..
Yeah, absolu-- Excuse me, can we get that whole pie?

Can we take the whole thing?
Thank you, it looks tremendous.

Thanks a lot.
She just gave you a whole pie.

Yeah, let's do it.

Come on in.

Want a beer?
Sure.

I like your place.
Thanks, it's wreck control.

So they keep training to kick me out.

It's kinda drafty in here.
You cold?
No.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Where did you get it?
I found it.

It's so small.
I think it looks like me.

Really?
Yes

No. .. you're prettier.
How about now?

You're still prettier.
You think so?
I do.

I think you're just great.

You know that's so great about you - you real.

You don't pretend that you got it all figured it out.

Like everyone else walking around life.
You're real. You're genuine. And you notice things too.

You pay attention .., like the monkeys.

When I look at you ..

I can see you.

I see you.

I just think you're great.

Thank you.
I'm meant it.

Seriously, I want to quit the zoo
long time ago if you do not work there, really.

Thank you.
Do not thank me, just...

Are you dating the winning conversation guy or what?
No.

You're not?
Dating him? No.

Alright, I was just checking,
because you never know.

I want to ask you...

So have you running to that Giant Mechanical guy walking around?

I want to kiss you.

What?
I want to kiss you.

Okay.

That zoo job is the best thing that ever happened to me.

I always look forward to seeing you.
Me too.

You know what... we should definitely should hang out more.

Yes.
Yes. I'd like that.

Do you like silent films?
Silent films? I loved them.
Really?
-Yes.

Well, they do the silent film program
At the art-house cinema. Yes, I've been there.

Do you want to maybe go with me, Friday night?

You and me?
Yes.

And I thought, I could ask my sister and her husband if they want to join us.

I already get to meet your sister?

This is getting serious.

I was just..
No, it's good, that sounds great.

Okay, we don't have to get serious...
No, serious it was good. I like serious.

You do?
With you, I do.

Sonia.
Yes, Janice.

Can I talk to you?
Sure. What is up?

I do not like my job.
You do not?

No, I'm better than selling drinks.
Okay, what kind of job do you want?

Just something where I can think,
and make decisions.

You said I'm over qualified when you hired me.
I did say that, didn't I?

Did something happened to you?
Yes.

A lot happened to me.
I can tell.

What about assistant habitat coordinator?
I can do that.

Good, go do it.

Thank you.

Hang on, Janice?
Hey, Jill. Guess what?
Hey, we're leaving at 6.
We're going to what?
We have a dinner with Doug.

You didn't forget, did you?
Anyway, 6 o'clock.

Sorry, It was just my sister.

The most important part. Do not be
vegetation, try a conversation.

Absolutely, I get what you're saying, but I just say
it is different for guys.

No it's not.
Honey, sure it is, I mean women are more cautious.

I think, it depends on the woman.
Maybe.

Janice, what do you think?
I will not ask, cause she hadn't have that much experience with guys.

Yes, right Janice?
What?
Are you listening?
Not really.

I've just saying you haven't had many boyfriends.

Excuse me, I going to the restroom.

Okay.

There is a great little wine bar near just
 down the street, for the night cup?

Yeah, that sounds fantastic.
Yeah, but I'm Janice will say no.

You know what? Maybe I'll be able to convince her.
You guys go ahead.

We are here alone, we'll walk down together.
Great, it's just around the corner.

Great.

Where did they go?
You know what?

They had an idea to go down the street for a little night cup, but if you not up for it, we can...

No, that sounds great.
Okay, very cool.

It's chilly out here.
Yes, it's fine.

You know I can ..

Wow, this weird robot dude.

"Take me to your leader."

That was nice.

Doug, please, stop.

You do not feel the vibration?
No.

Loose it up.

Hey, Sonia, have you see Tim?
Tim? No, he did not come in today.

Oh, that's weird.

Assistant habitat coordinator.
Its amazing.

Congratulations, Janice.
Thank you.
What kind of outfit you'll be wearing?

Pants, probably pants
Probably.
Where is your friend?

He will here.
Yeah, but the movie is about to start.

Are you guys come to movie?
Yes.
We gonna be start.

They gonna be starting. Like now.
Okay, okay.

Come on!

Come on, Tim

Maybe I should call Doug?

Doug, hi, it's Jill.

Doug, thanks so much for coming, she's really bored.

Come on, it's all good.
She's gonna be so happy to see you.

Janice, look who's here, Doug.

What ..? What is he doing here?

Janice, do not be rude.
He came to see you.

Ouch, Janice.
She's just upset, cause the zoo guy didn't show up...

But she'll be fine, right, Janice?
You'll be fine.

What're you doing? Come on, Janice. You're being weird.
You just need a sense of accomplishment, Janice.

Yes, or yoga.

She just needs a new attitude, because she always so negative.
There's a chapter in my book about positive thinking...

Every time I read it,
it puts me in a real good place.

See? That's what she needs.
You need to read his book.

No, Jill.
I do not need this god damn book.

I do not need a god damn thing.
Okay.

Stop it, okay? Stop.

Stop with the books and the stupid dates
and stupid advise because I do not want it.

I do not want any of it.
Fine, what do you want then?

No, I just trying to help.
No, you not helping Jill.
You're not helping me.

Can you see that?
You hurting me.
Can you see that you're hurting me?

God, I just feel that you should really read the book.
Doug, stop trying so hard.

Janice...
He's go and on.

Okay, alright everyone .. Let's just calm down, please.
Doug let's give ladies a minute.

Why do you always have to be so weird?
Stop talking to me like that, Jill.

I'm supposed to be the big sister.
I'm supposed to be your big sister.

-Yeah.
Yeah but, you're always talking down to me.

No, I'm not.
Yes you are, Jill. Always. Always talking down to me.
 Telling me that I need,

Telling me that I'm doing wrong, all the time

I mean, I do not want what you want, Jill.

I do not want that you want.
Okay fine, what do you want, Janice?

What?
I do not know. I do not know.

Do I have to know? Is the fee of the universe like...
Why do I have to know?

Why do I have to be something?
Can I just be myself? Is not that just enough?

Sorry, can you keep it down a little bit?
Sorry.
Thanks.

Janice.

I'm just worried about you.

I feel like you are struggling and
I just want to help.

If you really want to help, just being my little sister. Okay?
Can you do that? Can you just be my little sister?

Yes
Thank you.

Because the truth is, right now I could really use a sister.
Okay.

I think...

What? Come on, Janice. You can tell me.

I think I'm in love with him.

Who?
Tim.

And I'm confused, because I do not understand...
I mean, he supposed to be here.

Yeah, I know.

I'm sorry, Janice.

Let us go home.
I do not want to go home.

No?
No, I'm really embarrassed.

I do not really want to see those guys.
Okay.

I kinda just be by myself for a little while.

You sure?
Yes.

Alright, I'll get the boys.

Hey, Remember me?

So you just stand out here all night.

I do not have any extra change, I'd give it to you, but...

Can I ask you something?

When I saw you on TV, you said
something about people feeling lost?

Is that how you feel?
Because sometimes...

Sometimes I just feel invisible.

And I heard someone say something recently, that it's
only take one person ..

Just one person to make you feel like you belong, to make you feel special.

And I think that that's true.

I know that that's true because I felt it.

The other night I was out with this guy that I worked with...

... work at the zoo.

And anyway, it was only for one night...

But it just felt different, you know?

And now it's complicated.

Tim?

The Giant Mechanical Man.

Hey, guys. This is Tim.
Nice to meet you.

I think we can move it a little to the left
to give them more room to eat.

And maybe bring up some enrichment here.
-I can see that. Right over there.

Alright, Janice. Thank you.

Now this whole thing. Everything we gonna do here, we gonna open up the whole space.

And we gonna have this extra little habitat area, right over there.

Jill, you guys should come down town to meet us.
We gonna see a play later.

Actually, I'm looking for a Tim right now.
There he is. Let me know.

Flag on a play!

Now, if you think about it.
A conversation is a little bit like a football game, isn't it?

You got one, two, three, four-quarters.

If you are really lucky, what do you get?

What do you get if we're really lucky?

You get over time. Right?

In order get to over time, you can not blow off
all your fun stuff, all your trick plays in the first quarter, can't you?

You gotta wait for half-time, or, as I like to call it, end of dinner

Just a stuff get a little stale, a little boring. Bang!
You pull out your best joke.

Or even better, a little story.
Doesn't matter if it's not true. Make it up. Lie. Doesn't matter.

The entire point is you gotta get to over time,
because that's is where all the fun happens.

This guy know what I'm talking about, right?
"Touchdown!"
