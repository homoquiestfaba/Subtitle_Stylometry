Oh, some people
really don't care, Violet.

They don't.

I know that.

They just let stuff happen
up there

and they roll with it.
Yeah, I know.

Content with whatever random
chance delivers to them.

But that's not me, Violet.

Really?
Sorry.

I'm talking about control,
Violet.

I know.
Carefully exercised,

meticulous control.

Oh, I got a call coming in.
Mhm.

Do not hang up.
Ugh.

Hi, hi, hi, hi.

Hi, hi, hi, sorry, yes, yes.

Would it help if I told you
that I'm on mushrooms?

No, okay, they're waiting
for you inside.

Who are you talking to?
Sorry, nothing, Bob.

Because life is too short,
Violet.

Hey, David,
this is coming off your time.

Well, you...
You know what I mean.

Uh-huh.
I think the expression

still applies here.
Welcome to the Death of Comedy!

Yeah!

How's everybody doing?

Hello, how's everybody
doing tonight?

Fair.

I respect that.

How's everybody else doing?

So when you come
to the show with a sack

of bottom-shelf booze
it makes a difference.

Not just to the talent
of the show

but to the prestige
of the show itself.

Top-shelf for now on, all right?

I don't want us
to look like assholes.

Oh, and uh, the... the dark
of the moon is coming up.

So uh, I... you know.
Yep, I know.

(distant police sirens)

Life's too short, Violet.

That's how racism works,
right, you know?

I don't mean like you know,

muttered, in-traffic,
casual, weekend racism.

Okay, alright!

With... and with that
searing social insight,

methinks this crowd has been
sufficiently warmed up.

You may know our
first performer from college.

That's how I know him.
Give it up for Andy Jocelyn!


Uh, hi, I'm Andy Jocelyn.

Um, tell you all a bit...
a little bit about myself.

Uh, when I was 6 years old,
I was first diagnosed as a hunk.

And it's been tough,
it's been tough ever since...

Hey, you're Violet, right?
Yeah.

Hi, I'm uh, Dax Hanlan.

Hi.
...every girl I go home with

has a body pillow.
I'm from Boston.

And why are they all named
Idris Elba?

Explain that to
me. Explain that.

Is this your show?
The one you're talking through?

Yeah, it's my show.
Cool.

Well, I was a uh,
regular at the Comedy Pit,

back in Boston, and then
Dave's Douchebag of Comedy

I did a few times, so...
That's really... okay just...

yeah, you can message
the show page

and I'll throw you up
if we have a spot for you.

Awesome, thank you, um.
That was all I could remember.

Oh, no, hold on.
This is true.

I was uh, I was driving home
last night

and uh, I went through
a DUI checkpoint, totally sober.

Have you ever done this?

Oh my God,
it's the greatest feeling.

I've never been
so confident in my life.

I've never been so confident.

I'm like, "Oh yeah,
I'm turning the radio up.

You'll have to ask
for me to turn it down."

Wait, can you get...
I was wearing a Polo.

So you book Too Late, right?

And he pulled me out
of the car in a Polo shirt.

No, I don't book Too Late.
Aren't you... you're Bob Devore's

assistant, right?
Sorry what was it? Dax?

Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, I am Bob's assistant,

but I don't book that show.
I've never booked that show.

No one will ever book
the show other than Bob,

because according to him,
basically

nobody's good enough to do it.
Okay?

And I don't really know
how things worked at whatever

you know, piss-stained wing hut
you came up in,

but around here,
generally speaking,

the way to get on a show
isn't harassing the booker

of the show during the show.

Got it?

So just message the show page.

Okay.
Right, okay.

These other local hangout
yokels, they're like...

Fuckin' stuck-up bitch.
"How do you know my dog?"

I was like, "I am too high to
be at the bar." This is crazy.

They didn't know my dog,
they just heard me

talking to my dog.

And then I was like,
"What, what, what, what?

Wh... why are you
talking to my dog?

Sir, this is a dognapping
in progress.

I'm not having any of it.
Are you kidding?

You're gonna steal
my dog under my watch? No.

But that's how
human trafficking starts.


â™ª â™ª

If you had any idea
how tired I was, you would

not be making bacon right now.

Hmm, you are a great friend
and roommate, Vi,

but between you and bacon,

bacon wins every time.

Wow.

That is so nice.

Oh, how did TDOC go last night?

Aside from David being
on mushrooms the entire time,

it was really good.
Are you serious?

Yeah, whole time.
Is there anything

he won't do on mushrooms?
No.

God, that lady from TelaVid,
she show up?

Oh, Donna Rudinsky?
Yes.

No, she did not come,
but uh, I have sent her office

so many invites that they
probably think I'm a stalker.

Oh, well, answer me this.

Why do you think people
go to a show?

To laugh.
No.

They come to a show because
there's something there.

What's that?
They come because you've

created something of value.

Will you tell that to uh,
the woman who runs Coffee Lust,

because she threatens
to shut down my show

like every other week.
Yeah, but she hasn't, because?

Value.
Yes!

Yes!
She gets it!

Look at that.
Okay, yes, so value yourself

Vi.
Alright, well, it's not

as easy as that, Belinda.
Mm-mm, no, no, no, no.

Mm-mm, get my name
out of your mouth

if you're gonna say stuff
like that, okay.

It's not easy,
but that's how it's done.

Value yourself.

Okay. Thank you.
Mhmm.

(phone vibrating)

You jumped.
Uh, the water sloshed.

You jumped like a gun went off,
Vi.

I'm... I'm tired.
No. No, I'm tired.

I am tired of watching you
slave for this guy

thinking it's gonna
lead anywhere.

I don't slave!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Do not lie to me today.

Today is bacon day.

Do not ruin it with your lies.

It's not so bad.
He's never gonna let you go.

I feel like I'm on an island.

There's like... there's like
a million bridges off it

you know, but every single one
burns the second I try to leave.

That job is your whole life.

I can't even remember
the last time

there was any Vi-oriented
penis in this house.

Oh, well, it...

It's a drought, okay?
Okay, easy.

Yeah.
There's more to life than...

Oh, than a boss that only lets
you peek in the party

but never invites you in?

TouchÃ©, Belinda.
Yeah.

TouchÃ©.
Okay, go.

I'm going, I'm gone.
Go scurry off to your phone.

Okay.
Oh, and you're welcome

for the bacon, by the way!
Oh my...

Alright, cue one.

Cue two.

Next.

What the fuck... Fredo?

Huh?
What the fuck is this?

Cue three.

No, the... the blue,
what gel is this?

Hmm?

The blue, what gel did you use?

It's a 60.

No this... mist blue.

I asked for a mist blue.

Yeah, mist blue, this is 60.

No, 61 is mist blue,
60 is no color blue.

You want me to look like
a corpse up here?

My bad, sorry.

Alright, well, switch it out.

Corpse anyway.

Oh, I'm glad you could make it.

Is this what you got?

Yeah, that's what they had.
Ugh.

Alright, look,
if Gina gets upset,

it's your head, not mine.

You got Gina Obispo?

Yeah, she was in town.

Nice get.

What do you think I do all day?

Set this up backstage.

Fredo.
Yeah?

Let's run it again,
uh, this time I'll pretend

that I don't know
the blues are all fucked up.

Yeah, I'll pretend I care.

Oh, and uh,
Violet, don't forget,

dark of the moon.

I don't know why
but I feel so cosmo tonight.

Cosmopolitan pink.

Just add vodka
and I'm ready to drink.

Aw, listen to me going on
about pink martinis with

and without cherries, here
I am supposed to be watching

my figure and I tell you I have,
I've been watching it for years

and I still can't figure out
where it went,

I know it's inside me somewhere.

Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

(audience laughing)

Hello? Oh, hi.

Do you have any ice back here?
Hm?

I mean I like warm well whiskey
as much as the next lady.

I just thought...
Right.

Get lucky
and live like a princess.

You a comic?

I saw you writing
in that notebook.

No, no, I just... I work for Bob.

Is he making you take notes?
No, no, no, no,

this is just something
I'm working on.

Hmm, aren't we all
working on something?

He's a cocksucker, right?

I don't...

It's okay, I won't tell.

You can admit it. Say it.

I think it's more like
he just like loves

for the show to be perfect.

So he's a cocksucker.

Yeah.

Don't worry, uh...

Violet.
Violet!

They all are.

And you're a comic, so...
Here she is...

I gotta go.
...Gina Obispo, everybody!

Be professional.
Yep, to you.

(audience cheering)

Hey, did you guys know
you can do a bunch of yoga

and still be an asshole?

(Audience laughing)

My husband told me that,
random fact, I know.

And then he said,

"It's not a random fact.

I'm telling you to your face.

You're an asshole."


Very intimate.
Pretty great.

You hear the laughs immediately.

Yeah, this is a treat.

Thanks for having me.
Next time better bourbon.

Hey, it's the comedian.
Hey, nice act.

The comedian?

Yeah, we met backstage earlier.

No, no, this is Violet,
my assistant.

Oh, are you... you have something
against women comedians?

Me? Never!

I had two on the show,
you one of them.

Yeah, you're counting them.
Right? Come on.

On one hand.

He's afraid of the competition.

Oh, knock it off.

Do you need something?

I was just hoping
maybe I could hang with Gina...

Hey, Bob, be careful
how you treat your assistants,

cause they know
where the bodies are buried.

Well, Violet would never
leave me, would you, Violet?

No, no, no, in fact, I think you
would probably die without me.

Ah, Fredo!
Uh, sorry.

I forgot to ask um,
are you going to David's?

Oh, right, the cult thing?
Yeah.

Yeah.
Can I maybe ride with you?

Sure, yeah, I could use a drink.

Let's go.
Oh.

Well, not all the way
to the party,

my apartment's on the way, so.
So you wanted a...

so you wanted a ride home?
Mhm yeah, but you should go.

I should?
Yes.

Why?
Because you seem tense.

No.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

Drink, my children!

Drink and become one
with the cosmos!

Ey, Vi's here!

The prophecy has been fulfilled!

Yes.

So your party
is mass suicide-themed?

There's no comedy police, Vi.

Only censors.
Oh.

Oh shit, that's really good.

I gotta... I gotta write that
down.

Well...
No, that's good.

I don't know
if it's writing-down good.

(Indistinct chatter)

Ah.

(muffled conversations)

Oh yeah,
look at all that value, Vi.

Ugh!

Ugh.

Oh, congratulations, Violet,
you found a closet.

Slash my bedroom.
Oh, sweet fancy cock.

Hi.
Hi, Jimmy Rhodes.

Okay, hi.
Hi, I rent David's closet.

Violet.
Hello.

Uh, it... I know it's small,
but it's also super pathetic.

So...
That tickles.

Well, I think we're trapped.

What? Like existential...

Uh, okay.

Right.
Naughty like that.

So um, what do you do
when you're not in your closet?

I uh, I'm a dog walker.

You're a comedian?

Yes.
Uh, okay.

Now, well,
you're in good company.

Oh, do you do stand-up?

No, but I'm a booker.

I know.

Then why'd you ask?

I don't wanna seem desperate.

Mhm, all right.

Well, this is where you ask for
a spot

and I tell you
to just message the show page.

Why would I do that?

I mean you've never even
seen me perform.

I could be terrible.

Jimmy Rhodes, thank you.

You're welcome. For what?

Well, for being
the least desperate person

I've met in years.

Well, give me a few minutes.



Uh, just not much further
you can go in Columbus.

Ooh.
Comedy-wise.

Yeah.
There are like a few clubs

in the city, but you know,

mostly you're going up
in between trivia nights

and music open mics.

It's pretty much
the same as here.

Except here you get paid.

So uh, where are you from?
Here.

Oh, you saved yourself the trip.

You know, that's why I did it.
Smart.

Yeah, I came out
and I was just like,

Let's just... yeah,
save on gas for the family.

Yeah, not a lot of babies
worry about that.

Well, those babies are dumb.

Okay.

No.

No.

No, no.

Oh.

I think they're done.

Should probably make your escape

in case they get a second wind.

Oh, yes.

Yeah, a third wind.

Can I uh, can I give you uh,
my number?

Yes.
Okay.

(Indistinct muffled chatter)

It's R-H-O-D-E-S,

just in case you forget.

Forget all this?

Nuh-uh.

You know where to find me.

Goodnight, Jimmy R-H-O-D-E-S.

Um, goodnight, Violet.

My friends call me "Vi".


Hey.
Jesus!

People should wear
fucking bells.

What's your problem?

You don't remember me?

Lance something?

Dax!

Dax from Boston.
Okay.

Alright, Dax.

Good night, Dax.

Hey, where are you going?

I'm going home, it's late.

No, it's not.

Yes, it is.

No.
Okay, stop.

Look, it's early.
Okay.

You don't think I'm good enough
for your show, hmm?

Stop, give me the keys.
Mm-mm.

I'm gonna show you
how good I am.

You don't want this.

No.

You really don't.

I really do.

Please stop.

Please, okay, please, stop.

I want it.

Too Late.
Hm?

I can... I can book you
on Too Late.

Are you fuckin' with me?

Come on!
That's what I'm talking about.

Okay, just come
to the next show.

You'll be ready for me?

Oh yeah, I'll be ready.

I'll see you then.

Okay.

Too Late.

Too Late.
Hm?

(car door slamming)

(audience laughing)

This... uh, I read this
really interesting fact today.

I read that, uh,
more soldiers in the Civil War

died from diarrhea

than from actual war wounds.

That's true.
Isn't that interesting?

Yeah, I was reading about it,

because I am
a huge diarrhea buff.

You ever seen
Ken Burn's diarrhea?

18 hours...

The iPhone started...
Boo.

Ah!
What is this?

No, give it back, Dax,
those are mine.

I said give it back!

Are these your jokes?
Dax, stop.

I said give it back!
Sh!

You're Bob Devore.

I'm Dax Hanlan from Boston.

This is the comic I was,
uh, telling you about.

The new talent
you wanted me to find.

Well, enjoy the show, Dax.

Knock 'em dead, pops.

(audience laughing)

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Bob?

Come in.

Hey.

Bob, you remember Dax?

Right.

See you in a couple of days,
Bob.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

You wanna stay
and uh, party with us?

Ah, I wouldn't wanna
keep Bob waiting.

Thanks, babe.

(keys jingling)

It's a pretty good show.

I mean I thought the juggler
was a little bit faggy,

but it's your shit, right?
It's not for everybody.

â™ª â™ª

Dude.

I cannot believe
I'm about to rail lines

with Bob fucking Devore.

It's unbelievable.

â™ª â™ª

You know, not to tell you how
to do your business or anything,

but you gotta get yourself
a new assistant, dude.

I mean she's a hot piece of ass
and everything,

but she is way too stuck up.

What the fuck?

What the hell?

Come on, man!

What the hell?

(muffled shouting)

You keep the cocaine.
You can keep the cocaine,

I don't care!
Goodbye, Dax.

No!

No!

No!

â™ª â™ª

Fredo, I got soda!

They didn't have
that cactus thing you like,

but I got a Japanese one.

Looked it up and it stands
for happy pineapple.

How fun is that?

Okay, Fredo?

Fredo, popcorn machine is down.

Above my pay grade.

Hey, Fredo,
can you help me with this?

I don't know
what any of it means.

Fredo!
He's out.

Ah! Bob, I thought
you were still recovering.

Dax wasn't much of a meal.

It's been like three days.

It was like eating air.

You're making me nervous,
Violet.

Oh, I'm making you nervous?

I can make things happen
for you,

but only if you do your job.
I am doing my job!

I drove all the way to Ontario
last week to scout talent.

And what did you find?
It was Ontario.

You went into this
with open eyes, Violet.

We could have ended it
right there, but you agreed.

You've got four weeks
till the dark of the moon.

I've been patient with you,
Violet.

Don't test me.

â™ª â™ª

Listen, when you get inside,
please do me a favor...

Wait, is that Violet Fields?

(car motor humming)

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Vi.

Jimmy.

Rhodes, R-H-O-D-E-S.

Uh, how is the show going?

Oh, it's about to start, so...

Right, yeah.

So you come to beg for a spot?

Yep, I'm the worst.

Hey, are you coming in or what?

Hey, yeah, give me one sec.

Oh no, I... if you're busy,
I can just go away.

No, no, Violet's never too busy
for her friends.

This is Jimmy.
Hello, Jimmy.

We met at David's, you know,
mass suicide party.

Oh, that's nice.
Um, sorry.

So I just give them
the one-minute light.

What?
When I'm running the show

tonight,
so you can have a break.

God damn it.

I'm sorry I... I gotta get that.

No, I've got it.
Violet!

Hi, this is Violet,
please leave a message.

Pick up the phone!
He hung up.

Well, you have the night off,
do you wanna go get food?

Yeah, Vi, do you?

I...

â™ª â™ª

You know what? Fuck Bob.

Yeah, yeah!
Yeah!

Fuck Bob.

Is fuck Bob a "yes"?

Yeah.
Cool.

Okay, yeah.
Cool.

Yeah, yeah, okay, go.
Get out of here.

Get out of here.

He'll call.
Bye, bye.

Thank you.
Have fun!

God, I hope she remembers
how to use that thing.

Yeah, are we ready to start?
Where's Vi?

Mm, she's not coming,
she is on a date.

Really?
Yes, really.

Are you on shrooms right now?

No.

Not as far as you know.

It's good enough.

Fuck it.

So uh, how's the old closet?

All right, it keeps me
off the streets, okay?

Uh, I am looking for
like a nicer place,

but uh, I don't know, you know?

No, I do not know. What?

Right, um, my friend got me
this writing job uh,

in New York on an award show
and once that was over,

I was like,
"Well, I have this one sort of

tenuous connection
to this place.

What I should probably do
is move

to the other side
of the country

where I have no connections

and know absolutely no one."

That's a great plan.

People often say,
"You can plan real well."

Okay, but you know, David.

Does anyone really know David?

Mm.
Yeah.

You know me.

That I do.

Thanks for dinner.
Oh.

I really should have paid.

I was the one who invited you.

Jimmy, you live in a closet.

You're funny, Violet.

Mm.

I wasn't being
like condescending.

It... that was
like an admission of envy.

Envy?
I've just never really met

anybody like you before.

So why are you booking
but not performing?

Uh, why am I...
I mean you know, life costs.

I needed a job, and Bob offered,

and I couldn't say no.

Right, but not even
on your own show?

Well, it'd be a conflict
of interest.

The entire reason
people start shows

is so they can book themselves
on said show.

Okay, well...
So, it's a real racket.

Okay.
Yeah.

Mm, you know, I think...

I think we all like start out

with this idea of like
what we think we wanna be,

but we end up
just being what we are.

Do you like ice cream?
I like ice cream.

Okay, great. I'm just loaded...

You are...
With dog-walking money.

And it's absolutely
burning a hole in my pocket.

Good show, man, that was fun.

Uh, yeah, yeah.
You did great!

Well, thank you so much
for helping.

I'll see you later.

Bye!

â™ª â™ª

(faint growling)

â™ª â™ª

No.

No, no, no, no.

â™ª â™ª

Oh shit.

This is me.

Yep.

Scene of the crime.

What?

I don't know.

I just said it.

Okay.

Uh.

Thank you for dinner.
Thank you for ice cream.

Okay.
Okay.

Why don't you just go do it?

Hey, Jimmy.


â™ª â™ª

Can I tell you something
I've never told anyone

this soon after meeting them?

Okay.

I wanna book you on my show.

And you just tell me like that?

I'm so...
I just thought

it would be special.
I know.

The first time with...
Right.

...candles or music or...
I... yeah, I thought lots of

like harps and doves, but it's
just it's happening so fast.

Okay. Yes, I...
You wanna do it?

Yes, I'd like to do it.
You wanna do it?

Yes, thank you. I'm flattered.

Okay.

Oh God.

Brace yourself!

Andy!

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry, I just...
You almost got a face full

of key, dude.
Oh, I... hey,

I didn't mean to uh...
What do you want?

Is uh, Death of Comedy
still going on?

No, it ended.

Damn it.

What are you doing right now?

I'm going to bed.

Okay.

Alright, I just... can I...

can I ask you...

Yeah, can I... a word.

Just a word.

Um, just in the spirit
of trying harder

can um... Did Violet ever say

they were putting on Too Late?
Good night, Andy.

I just...

Okay, cool.

This is a sweet ride.
Good night.

Oh, okay, all right.
Bye.

Okay, okay!

Fuck it.

(keys jingling)





â™ª â™ª


(car engine revving)


Good morning.

Morning.

I'm just gonna borrow a bag.

You owe me for last night.

Oh!

Oh, I basically quit my job!

But was he nice?

Oh my God, you are
blushing right now, Violet!

He is nice!
Stop!

Yes.
Go away.

Someone got some last night!

Oh my God.

Oh um, excuse me, Mrs. Rhodes...

You're... what are we 12?
I'm just gonna borrow

this bag real quick.
All right, take the bag.

Get out.
Did he have soft lips?

I'm done.

Hey, Bob?

â™ª â™ª

Bob?

â™ª â™ª

Hey Bob?

â™ª â™ª

Bob.

â™ª â™ª

It's Violet.

â™ª â™ª

Ah!

â™ª â™ª

I know I look terrible.

I've just never seen you
this soon after eating.

Where were you?

I'm sorry, I should have called.

I just...
Look, don't apologize,

it turns my stomach.

Bob, who'd you eat?

Some open-miker
in Glassell Park.

No talent at all, but a lot
of well bourbon and nicotine,

and my head's killing me.

No,
there's got to be another way.

There's no other way.

Look, you have resources!

We can figure it out!

No, I'm not good with money.

Uh, after all
the years of performing,

you haven't saved up anything?
No.

Uh, how old are you?

What do you want from me?

I'm an entertainer.

You know what?
Here's what I think.

Look,
you're not supposed to think!

You're supposed to feed me!
That's it!

I told you a million times,
it's all about trust.


â™ª â™ª

Look, just... just do your job.

â™ª â™ª

I'm looking for comfortable
shoes that won't make me look

like a biblical character.

I went shoe shopping
and I told the sales person,

I was like, "I'm looking
for some comfortable shoes."

This lady brought out
the most hideous-looking shoes.

I was like, "Oh, hell no."
I am not trying to be

one of Tracy Chapman's
backup dancers.

Those are birth-control shoes.

I'll never get laid
in those shoes.

Someone will ask me,
"Girl, are you on the pill?"

I'll be like, "Nope,

but I got on some Birkenstocks!"

No sperm can penetrate these.

Hey, here he is.

Finally fucked
his way to the top.

Oh, it's too late
to turn back now.

Yeah, you just remember whose
closet it all started in,

you little skank!
Sh!

I was just calling him a skank.

I know.
It wasn't heckling.

I know.
I was like,

"It's only been two years."

How much wear
and tear did you think

I was gonna go through in
a two-year period, you know?

And I had to think you know,
when I was at a party

and I saw her, did she turn
to her friends, and say,

"You know what?
In two years, that bitch

is gonna look like Yoda."

"In two years, she's gonna look
like a Forever-21 dress

after the first washing."

Nothing but threads and rags,

that's all she's gonna be
in the end.

That's my time.

Thank you.

Uh, what can I say
about your next performer?

He's hilarious uh,

and I can also say as his
roommate, he's very tidy.

So please give a warm
Death of Comedy welcome

to Jimmy Rhodes,
ladies and gents.


I like going to uh, 7-Eleven
at like 2 in the morning,

cause you get to see
things there

you don't get to see
anywhere else.

Like I was at 7-Eleven,
2 in the morning.

Also, there was a woman
who was very, very obese.

Now, I am not including

that detail to make fun of her,

I am including that detail,

because she was also
wearing a t-shirt

that said on it "No fat chicks".

This lady fucking rules, man.

This is the best lady,
because she is going out

at a time of night when people
are most likely to be stoned

and she is blowing their minds.

He's good, he's good.
Because she's gonna be there

and like they're gonna look...
Yeah, he is.

...and then they'll look up,
and she'll be like...

I hate him.
"And yet here I am."

Not like you know,
not like as a person, but.

Ooh, I hate him.
Also, when she wears

that shirt,
it becomes empowering.

Like it should have
a comma on it.

Like no comma.

Fat chicks.


Uh, I uh...
Hey, how are you?

I get super... I get super nervous

to have sex
with like a new lady.

Not... the sex sounds good,
I'm just afraid

of like being made a fool.
What are you doing here?

Like I'm worried...
Your show is so great

that you're turning away
paying customers?

It's free.
And I'll be like, "Yeah!"

Do you need something?
"Look at me go."

No, I've never seen
your show before,

so I thought I'd check it out.

Yeah, but this is like just kind
of like my thing.

Yeah, don't worry,
I'll keep a low profile.

It turns out though,
it's actually super easy to tell

if a woman is faking her orgasm.

If during her orgasm a woman
is sexy, she is faking it.

That is not what
that looks like.

If she's like, "Oh, Jesus,
baby." Get out of here.

What am I, 12,
I'm gonna fall for that?

But if she's like, "Blah".

Then it's like, "Yes! Yes!

Call my therapist,
I'm not coming in this week.

Alright, I'm done.
Thanks a lot, guys.


Jimmy Rhodes,
killing it like a pro

on his first TDOC appearance.
Good act!

Hey, great set.
Oh, Bob Devore.

Oh, thank you.
It was great.

How come you haven't told me
about Jimmy before?

We gotta get him on the show.

Um, I...

We're booked for months out...

Nah, we'll make room.

Yeah, we've got
to snatch him up

before somebody else does,
right?

Ah, you're in luck, folks.

You came on a good night.

We got a special guest
dropping in tonight.

Give a big, warm, TDOC welcome
to Mr. Bob Devore.

Yeah!

(cheering, applause)

Holy shit.

Bob Devore just booked me
on his show.

â™ª â™ª

Holy shit.

Well, nobody can accuse you
of nepotism.

I was driving home last night
and I went...

Good job, man.

Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

What? He had a good set.
You put Bob up,

you didn't even ask me,
it's my show, David...

Well, what did you want me
to tell him?

Message the show page?

Hey, what's wrong?
Nothing. I'm fine.

I was like, "Yeah,
I'll turn the radio up."

â™ª â™ª

Ah, come on.

Anyway, it's great to be here

in this, um, tiny little place.

Haven't been on stage
in a place like this

in a long time, but...

Hey, Jimmy, this is Violet.

About Bob's show,
I'm so sorry.

I just was... we're...

We're just not gonna be able
to fit you in.

Bob wants what he wants
when he wants,

but then reality sets in

and I got
to come be the bad guy.

I'm so sorry.
We'll keep trying, though.

I promise.
We'll get you on eventually.

Okay, I'm really sorry, Jimmy.

Hi, need some help?
No, I'm good,

but I got your pudding cups.

Right there.
Oh, sweet!

Yes, I got you chocolate.

Thank you, Vi.
You're welcome.

I swear, you are doing
God's work.

Wow, you're just a little ray
of sunshine today.

Got my pudding.
Yeah.

Bob's in a good mood.
Bob's never in a good mood.

Well, Donna's coming tonight.
Donna Rudinsky from TelVid?

Like, not her assistant?

Like the actual
Vice President of Production

from the network
is coming to our show tonight?

Tonight.
I've been trying

to meet with her for years.

Please don't make him mad, Vi.

I mean, if Bob's not happy,
nobody's happy.


â™ª â™ª

Hey, Donna's coming tonight?

Oh, yeah, yeah,
I meant to tell you.

I'll introduce you
if I get a chance.

Bob?

Hey, Vi.
Yeah, I asked Jimmy to come by

a little early
so I can show him around.

There's a lot of history here.

A lot of things have gone on
behind these walls, right?

Yeah, I'm gonna put
Jimmy up tonight.

I'll make room between acts.

Can I help you with those?
Oh, no, no. She's okay.

Aren't you, Vi?

â™ª â™ª

Oh, yeah.

I actually love spending money
I do not have

on things that I do not need,
though.

I love, uh, when you go
to a coffee shop

and the coffee
is seven dollars.

I'm like, "Okay,
ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

Oh, a latte is seven dollars.

Okay, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta."

"Oh, hi, Donna Rudinsky.

Violet Fields.

Great to meet you."

Why not make it nine?

Why not make it nine?
How about...

Thanks for the intro, Bob.
...I exchange my life

for this hot, darkened water

because, you know, uh,
existence is a liability

and being is profitless
in the first place,

am I right, millennials?

Oh!
Hey.

Just watching the audience?

Yep.

â™ª â™ª

I love seeing their faces.

Like, when you're up there,

it's like looking over
the edge of a cliff

with laughs coming out of it.

...anymore.
I'm not calling you.

Okay, all right, all right.

You know it's all
because of you, Vi.

I'm only here because of you.

I saw your next act perform
in a small little coffee shop,

but you're really gonna love him

because this kid
is going places.

Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Jimmy Rhodes!

(cheering, applause)

â™ª â™ª

I have, like,
a very specific haircut,

and the first time
I told the lady

who cuts my hair
what I wanted,

she was like, "Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Uh, you mean the young Hitler?"

And I was like,
"I don't think I do.

I don't think
I'm ever going to mean

the young Hitler."

As if my problem with Hitler
was his age.

Like, oh, I don't want
to look like

some old, busted Hitler.

No, no, no.

Like a young Hitler, yeah.

Like a hip, fresh, cool Hitler.

Back when he was
still painting all the time

and he was like... just like
mixed on the Jews, you know?

Uh, I like to go to 7-Eleven
late at night

because it is
a singular experience.

â™ª â™ª

Great show, Fredo.
Thanks.

Hope Donna liked it.

Did you get to meet her?
Nah.

Oh, that's a drag.

Next time, right?

Next time.

Night, Fredo.
Goodnight.

Hey, Jimmy?

Jimmy?

Jimmy?

â™ª â™ª

Jimmy?

â™ª â™ª

Jimmy! Jimmy!

Jimmy!

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

Jimmy!

Violet?

Hey, here she is.

Donna, this is Violet.
Oh, hi.

Violet, Donna Rudinsky.

Were you on the show?

I feel like we've met.

No, no, no,
Violet is my assistant.

Oh, you and your assistants.

Oh, whatever happened to, uh,
what was her name?

Uh, Erica?
No.

Uh, Lorrie?

Corrie?
Ah, that's it, that's it.

You remind me so much of her.

Oh, really?
Whatever happened to Corrie?

Well, don't look at me.

In this town, people come,
people go.

Well, you know, actually,
Violet is a producer, too.

Oh, you produce Too Late?

No. No, no, no.

No, I produce, like,
I have a show at a coffee shop.

Well, the variety format
is ripe for a reboot

and Too Late is going to slay.
Oh, right.

â™ª â™ª

Wait, you're making Too Late
into a TV show?

A pilot, for development.

And Bob wants me
to be one of the writers.

â™ª â™ª

Isn't that great?

Look at her, she's in shock.
I'm sorry.

She's been working on the show
for so many years,

she forgot what it's like

to be where the action is,
you know?

Don't worry, you'll be
right by my side,

assisting me
every step of the way.

â™ª â™ª

Yeah.
Every step.

We're all gonna be rich.

David, you're already rich.

Yeah, but now you guys
are gonna be rich too.

It's been lonely.
To the immediate

and lasting wealth
we will all get

from this one single pilot.

Hear! hear!

Yes!

What's the matter, Vi?

You're not excited
to ride your...

your soon-to-be-rich-and-famous
man's coattails?

Rich and famous.

Rich and famous!

You guys want another round?

Mm-hm.
You'll help me carry?

I'm your man.

â™ª â™ª

That's fun, right?

What the fuck is he doing here?

Oh, damn it.

No.
Fuck him.

Everything okay?

You just don't seem
too excited.

Excited on the inside.

Hmm, that real thing.

â™ª â™ª

You're Bob's assistant.

If the show does well,
you're gonna do well.

In theory.
In practice. In science.

No, you have not worked here
long enough to know that.

Money messes
with people's heads, okay,

so just be careful.

Is that Chase Morrow?

â™ª â™ª

David...
I'm just, uh...

Did you see his live special?

It was hilarious.

Yeah.

Wait, why do you look like
he killed your dog?

You didn't know Melissa.
Who's Melissa?

Chase used to date Melissa,
and let's just say

if Chase worried more
about Melissa ODing

on his living room rug
and less about how the story

would damage his brand,
she might still be alive.

David, don't...
I'm just...

It's fine, it's fine.

Okay, now David is talking
to Chase. Okay.

Wait, how does David
know Chase?

He used to date Melissa.

Hey, leave us alone.
David!

Oh!
Oh my God!

Oh my God, David!

Fuck you, dude!

Oh my God.

Wow, whoa.

That was cute.

Let's go, let's go.

Okay.

Congrats
on actually being funny

for the first time
in your life.

We're leaving, we're leaving.

Jesus, David.

Did you break your nose?

It's not broken,
it's just blood.

Okay, well, let's go.

Yeah, let's go drink some more
where we don't have to drink

with a fucking murderer!

Oh, David!

David, okay, come on,
come on, come on.

Well, listen,
you guys are awesome,

and I think you're ready.

Remember, folks, the key

is to have as much fun
as possible.

We want to let
the network folks know

that this show is great,

and we want everybody
to get paid, and you all?

You all get to say
you were in the audience

for the first episode ever!

Make some noise!


Well, it worked in rehearsal.
The paper bag thing is weak.

I don't know, I thought
it was sort of classic.

Well, I'm cutting it.

Okay, well,
maybe the next episode.

Let's get through today first.

Right. Uh...

Okay, uh, break a leg.

Hey.

See you on the other side.
Got it.

All right, so how do I look?

Like the famous Bob Devore.

Well, you could be happy
for Jimmy at least.

You're a monster, Bob.

At least Jimmy gets it.

In fact, I think
I might bring him on.

He's the head writer.

No, I had something else
in mind.

I'm not going to live forever.

At least, I don't think I am.

I'd like to impart what I have
to someone else.

You can do that?

You thought I was the first?

Please, Bob.

â™ª â™ª

Showtime.


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Violet?

Mm-hm.

Hey.

What are you doing?

I was drinking alone.

Everybody loved the show.

Donna said it went
really organically.

What does that mean?

I don't know,
but she kept saying it.

Come here, you.

Come here, come here, come here.

You ever get laid at work?

Okay, mm, mm, mm, mm.

Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

Hey, hey, hey, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

What, are you trying
to get me fired

after literally
my first episode?

Silly me. I totally forgot
you're like a big TV guy now.

Hey, what is wrong with you?

Nothing is wrong with me.

I'm certainly not some farm boy
from Ohio

who's in way over his head.

What?
You have no idea

what you're getting
yourself into.

This is gross. I'm gonna go.

No, no, no! Please, please,
please, don't go.

Just...

You have to quit.

Just listen to me.
He's gonna get inside of you,

he's gonna twist you up,

and he's gonna
turn you into him.

I don't think you know
what you're saying.

No, please!
I think you wish it was you

instead of me.

Yeah.

You're probably right.

So we should just stop.

What?

You're right.

This is fucking things up
between us,

so why don't we just stop?

If you think...

I do.

That is what I think, so...

â™ª â™ª

(door closing)

What the fuck?

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Ah...

â™ª â™ª

Fuck!

Come on! Fuck!

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(heavy breathing)

â™ª â™ª

(pills rattling)

â™ª â™ª

(heavy breathing)

â™ª â™ª

Oh, man.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(pills rattling)

Okay.

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

Life's too short.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Vi.
Sup?

â™ª â™ª

Is it Halloween already?

You're gonna feel very badly
about that once you find out

who I booked for the show
tonight.

What?

Chase Morrow in the house,
bitches!

Oh, you booked him?
Mm-hm.

I thought he only does movies.

I do do movies, but I got
to get back to my roots,

so when shy little Violet here
hit me up

to work with Bob Devore,

I said, "Fuckin' when
and where?"

Well, it's good to have you,
Chase.

Bring it up!

It's gonna be fuckin' lit.

â™ª â™ª

Yo! Uh, when the fuck am I on?

Hey, soon.
Cool.

Don't have anybody light me,
all right?

I'll do as much time as I want.

I fuckin' hate that shit.
Okay.

What are you doing?
Want some?

Everybody, welcome to Too Late.

After. What are you doing?
I got to go on.

Fuckin' pussy.

(indistinct chatter)

Fuck you.

And if you want a good seat...

Let's fuckin' do this.

All right, well, we're ready
for your first act, uh,

this guy is super funny,
movies, he's in one right now,

Chase Morrow, everybody!

Chase Morrow!

Keep it going for
that creepy old fuck, everybody.

Wow!

Where are you from, ponytail?

Is that not a ponytail?
No.

Oh, what are you doing?

Get a ponytail, man.

If I can grow a ponytail,
I'm fuckin' using a ponytail.

What are you thinking?
Come on, where are you from?

Augusta, Georgia.
Augusta, Georgia?

You guys got golf, right?

And, uh, the Civil War
was bad for you, um...

I'm so good at crowd work.

Where are you from, sir?

Denver? Okay, I've heard of it.

Um, I don't have
any material on that.

So that's not ideal.

Is anybody from, um, my dad?

(audience laughter)

(Chase laughs)

Oh, fuck. Um...

â™ª â™ª

Jesus Christ, Bob, I'm gonna
fuckin' eat shit up here, man.

Like, fix the stage, dude.

Oh, fuck. Um...

Does the city know
that this is happening?

â™ª â™ª

'Cause they should. It's bad.

Um, it's not up to code.

â™ª â™ª

Uh, you guys have been...

you guys have been here
for that.

Um...

â™ª â™ª

Thanks a lot.
I've been Chase Morrow, guys.

(hesitant applause)

â™ª â™ª

Chase Morrow, everybody,
the first act.

Come on, let's hear it for...

â™ª â™ª

What's up, boys?

There he is.

You!
Violet.

Right, sure, sure, yeah.

Dude, those pills
are no joke, right?

I'm feelin' fuckin' loose.

Good, yeah.

I know why you booked me,
by the way.

You do?

You always lookin' at me
all these years.

It's cool, let's just do it.

â™ª â™ª

Oh.
Whoa.

Somebody moves fast.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Chase!

Yo, you want to meet
this friend of mine?

You got to. Come on,
we'll keep hanging.

Let me buy you one.

â™ª â™ª

Um, why don't you guys
get out of here?

â™ª â™ª

Fucking go!

Not everything I say
is a goddamn joke.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, what's up?

Good to see you.

Actually, I was thinking
why don't we re-up?

I mean, I don't know, man,
I feel pretty good.

That shit's no joke.
This?

I pour this shit
on my cereal.

â™ª â™ª

Fuck, all right.

I'll party.

Oh my God.

â™ª â™ª

Let's fuckin' do it, right?
Mm-hm.

â™ª â™ª

Um, yeah. Okay, all right.

I've been waiting
a whole hour...

â™ª â™ª

This shit is not joke.

Um...

â™ª â™ª


Fuck.


Come and get it!


What the fuck are you doing?

Din-din!

Who's hungry, huh?

Is that Chase?
Yep.

Is he dead?

No.
What were you thinking?

The dark of the moon
isn't for days.

It's called "initiative," Bob,
and I took it.

But he's a huge star.

People are gonna
come looking for him.

He's a fucking mess,
people will just think

he drank too much
and fell in a river.

â™ª â™ª

Hmm, hmm.

You know, you were the one
that said

the other guy had no talent.

I mean, say what you will
about Chase,

but he's very talented.

Uh, I could eat.

Be my guest.

â™ª â™ª

(clears throat)

I can't do it
if you're watching.

By all means.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(growling continues)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

What did this guy eat?

Oh, about a dozen sedatives.

What?

He...

You...

You said it first, Bob.
Oh, no.

Life's too short.

Mine is anyway.

Well, I don't have
another half decade

to give to you, so what?

That you'll give me
maybe a leg up?

Or worse, I'll end up
like your little...

What was her name? Corrie?

Is that right?

Not me, Bob.

I'll...


â™ª â™ª

(heavy breathing)

â™ª I love to paint things â™ª

â™ª All over your skin â™ª

â™ª â™ª

Fine, drama.

â™ª â™ª

â™ª You love it when I touch â™ª

â™ª â™ª

â™ª Your flesh with the brush â™ª


Your boss ate Chase Morrow.

Yes.
The movie star?

He does movies now, yes.

Because he's a monster.

Yes.
What? Like a vampire?

I don't know.
Do you believe me, Belinda?

No!

Like, maybe because it's like
some metaphor.

Or like a really bad prank,
then maybe I'd believe you,

but this is just another reason

why you have to quit
this stupid fuck...

Oh, fuck!

Oh my, I'm gonna throw up!
Don't be sick for me, please.

Okay, I know. It's okay.

You made me an accessory!
I wouldn't have done it

if there was any other way.

Please, Belinda, please.

Fuck, fuck, fuck.

What are we gonna do?

We're gonna get rid of it.

Ow!

You know what you're doing?
What?

Every Tuesday,
you're moving my car.

Alternate parking.
You bet.

I'm sleeping in.
I'll come back with a coffee.

Yeah, fuckin' latte.


â™ª â™ª

Okay. You know what else?

What?
I want to...

What?
I want to use your deodorant.

What? You want to use
my deodorant?

Yeah, I do.

You're a freak.

You know what?
I just want to do it.

Okay, well, you can do it, okay?

Okay.

So it doesn't.



That's probably just the road.

No, I don't want to do this.

Yep.


Okay, okay.

Oh my God.
What?

Sink.
Sink, Bob, sink, please.

Sink, come on!

Maybe if I just...

You got me?
I got you, I got you.

Careful, careful.
I can't, I can't, I can't.

That's smart.
Yeah, that's probably smart.

Okay.


Sink! Come on!

Please, just fucking sink!

Oh my God. Oh my God.

Oh my God, it's sinking!

It's sinking!


Okay, we've done it.

Thank you.

Wait, wait, no, no, no.

No, no. No, no, no.

No, we are not there yet.

No, nuh-uh.
Okay, I get that.

This is the last time
I do this for you.

Whenever you're ready.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, I haven't seen you at all
and I was hoping

you were gonna come
to the show tonight.

Still no sign of Bob,
but, uh, we're doing it anyway.

Well, I'm doing it, actually.

Um, so, yeah,
I just thought it'd be cool

to have you here, um,

because I miss you.

Um, yeah. So, there, I said it.

You officially have
the upper hand.

Okay, uh, your move.

Bye, Jimmy.
Still no sign of Bob, huh?

Uh, yeah, no.

You want to choose
one of these gels?

What?
Gels.

Bob was very particular
about his blues, so...

Oh. No, I trust you.

Whatever you think is right.

No. You choose.

Choose a blue.

No, I... do you like the one
you're holding?

Do you like it?

Yeah, it looks blue.

Can you please pick a gel?

How about we do the one
in your hand?

Great, thank you.
Okay, cool. Great choice.

Thank you.

â™ª Nothin' ever happens
by the lake â™ª

â™ª Nothin' ever happens
by the lake â™ª

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Sir...


Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

Sir!


Oh, uh,

it's just that after hours,

we're supposed to sign
folks in and out so, um...


â™ª â™ª

You know,
forget I said anything

and, uh, you have a nice night.

Just gonna walk backwards
for a little while.


Have a good one.


â™ª â™ª



You got this, okay.

You've seen it
a thousand times.

Hi, my name is Violet.

Hi, my name... huh...

Welcome to Too Late.

Hello. Good evening.

Welcome to Too Late.

I'm, um...

Uh, Bob Devore is not...

he's not gonna be
hosting tonight.


Sorry, I had a little...

It's like
one of those salt cra...

I just had a little...

Pita is the word.
A pita cracker.

Um, my name is Violet.
Fuck yeah, it is!

Yeah!


Those are my friends.

Um, yeah, my name is Violet
and, actually,

I'm gonna be hosting
the show tonight.

I am at a point
in my gender transition

where a trace amount of sexism

is also really validating
for me.

I was walking
through a neighborhood,

there was a guy on a stoop,
he saw me walk by,

he goes,
"Hey, girl, you like music?"

And I do like music.

And then I heard his buddy go,

"Hey, man, that's not a girl,"

and I'm like, "Oh no,
I'm gonna get stabbed,

this is gonna be a sad story."

And then he added,
"That's a woman."

Woo!

Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

The only thing I think to do

with, like,
an affirming cat call

was to, like, stop,
and flip my hair,

and name a product.


Right? "Hey, man, that's not
a girl, that's a woman,"

and I'm like,
"Feria by L'OrÃ©al.

Maybe she's born with it

or maybe she did go
to a series of doctors."


(indistinct whispering)

Does anybody...
who likes Shakespeare?

Ah!

Hi.
Hi.

Um, so, Bob's gone, huh?

Mm-hm.

You wouldn't know.
Thanks.

Yes, I just wanted to...

You go.
Okay,

I didn't want to kiss Chase.

He just grabbed my face
and had his way with it.

I kind of wanted to kill him.
Me too.

You were right about the pilot.

I shouldn't have taken the job.

Bob should've offered it to you,

and I never should've
jumped ahead of you for it.

Uh, I have to tell you
something.

If you... do you have any...
can you just stay here?

Okay.
Okay.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Phew.

â™ª â™ª

Bob fuckin' who?
Oh, thank you.

Just promise me you won't
start doing stand-up, okay?

I don't want
to have to hate you, too.

Okay.
Hello.

Hey, speaking of incredibly
talented people I despise.

What's up? What's up?

Are we fighting still?

Okay. All right,
you guys are good?

Come on, just kiss and make up.

Please.
Thank you.

Thank you, that's very helpful.

â™ª â™ª

You really were great tonight.

Thanks.

So what did you want to...

Okay.
Okay.

Okay.

Here we go.

Okay.


â™ª â™ª

Bob?
Uh-huh.

Not like a metaphorical monster?


â™ª â™ª

Wait. Chase?

Like the movie...
Shh.

The movie star Chase?
Yeah, that's the one.

You and Belinda...

â™ª â™ª

Fuck you.

Everything I've told you
is the truth

and you're the only person
in the world who knows it.

Mm-hm.

Me and Belinda.
You and Belinda.

Mm-hm. I don't get it.

It's the truth.

I don't believe you.

That's the only thing
I'm asking you to do.

I'll talk to you soon.

â™ª â™ª

You really were great tonight.

â™ª â™ª



Come back for you.



How was the show?

Did you make me proud?

I'm sorry, Bob.

You will be.

I had to do it.

Of course you did.

It was a clever trick
you played.

Maybe you're funnier
than I thought.

â™ª â™ª

Get away from me.

You're in my home, Violet.

You know, we didn't have much,

but we did have trust,
didn't we?

You don't have to do this, Bob.

I can go away.
You and I both know

there is only one way
this can end.

(growling, screaming)



â™ª â™ª

You know what
I had to go through

to get here tonight?

Chase did not agree with me.

And, now, I'm starving.


Go ahead.

â™ª â™ª

I'm just as guilty
as you are, Bob.

Every single thing
you asked for, I did.

Every single task,

every single chore,

every single person.

â™ª â™ª

All for what?

So that I could avoid obscurity,

maybe death,

or getting a real job.

You were nothing
when I found you.

You could've been so much more.

You're right, Bob.

I'm nothing.

I died the day I met you.

So go ahead.

Do what you do best.


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Violet?

Violet, are you in here?

â™ª â™ª

Bob?

â™ª â™ª

Jimmy.

Jimmy!

Hey.

What are you do...

Oh my God.

You are a monster.

I was going to tell you.

About this?
Well, yeah,

we're gonna be
working closely together

for several months,
so I think you should know.

That you eat people.

Jimmy, both you and I know

that comedians
aren't really people.

Oh my God.

People come and people go.

Nobody knows why
and nobody really cares.

Think of how many people
have gone in

and out of your life

and you don't even remember
their faces,

let alone their names.

Am I really that bad
when you come to think of it?

You eat people.

Yeah, but none of them
had a career.

None of them had a name.

Well, Chase, but I think
we can all agree

that he had it coming.

Wait...

Where's Violet?

I need help sometimes,
and she just couldn't

help me anymore,
you understand?

What did you do?

I do what I will!

â™ª â™ª

All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

You're going to go home,

you're going to tell no one
what you saw,

and when I need you,
I'll call.

You're insane.
Look, there are two kinds

of people in this world,
the eaters and the eaten.

To survive, you're going
to have to learn how to eat.

And I can show you
if you'll let me.

Someone will stop you.

Look around you, kid.

You'll do
what everyone else does.

You'll shut your mouth
and you'll play the game.

No one will stop me!

Not you, not Violet.


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Ah!

You can't do this!

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

I don't work for you
anymore, Bob.


â™ª â™ª

I came back to tell you...
It doesn't matter.

The impulse to be all, like,
coy and removed and meta,

but, like,
I love to see you shine.

Even if that means I don't win

because I love to see you shine
so, so much more

than I love to win
because I love you.

Please stop talking, okay?

Okay.
Okay.

â™ª â™ª

Oh.

Okay, yeah, that's disgusting.

I don't care.
Okay, me neither.

â™ª â™ª

The rent is more
than we had budgeted,

but I think we should take it

because we're not
gonna do any better

and I'm excited
to move in with you

because I love you,
which is a thing we say now

without feeling weird.

We sure do.
Have fun tonight.

Crazier things have happened.

Bye.

Hey, aren't you Violet?
I am.

Used to work
for Bob Devore, right?

I did, yeah.
Oh.

Whatever happened to that guy?

People come, people go.

He was one of a kind.

God, I hope so.

Are you still booking?
No.

So what do you do now?

So I was like, "Hey, officer,
I'm not wearing pants."


Okay, you guys have been
so awesome.

Are you ready
for your next comedian? Yeah?

Okay, yes, please
put your hands together

for the very funny
Violet Fields.

Thanks, girl.
