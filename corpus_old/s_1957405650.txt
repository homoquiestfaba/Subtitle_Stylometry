[INSECTS CHIRPING]

[BELL TOLLS]

HEADMASTER:
Lights out!

WOMAN:
Cletus, are you there?

CLETUS:
My angel.

This is for you.

What did the doctor say?

He said the mutations
are advancing.

My powers are too strong.

Cletus, I'm scared.

CLETUS:
It's gonna be okay.

They're coming to take me away.

[VOICE SHAKING]
They're sending me to a place

where there are others like me.

They can't do that.

[BREATH TREMBLING]

They can't take you from me.

You're my one bright light.

I will always love you!

CLETUS:
Frances!


FRANCES [GRUNTING]:
Get off!

Frances!

CLETUS: No! No!
[BANGING ON WINDOW]

[SIREN WAILS]

Any last words?

[SPEAKER BUZZES, CRACKLES]

<i>Welcome to your new home,

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

DR. PAZZO: <i>Your old
boyfriend's finally getting</i>

<i>what he deserves.</i>

<i>And the world will be
a safer place without him.</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

EDDIE: <i>Detective Mulligan,
with all due respect,</i>

<i>I don't want anything to do
with Cletus Kasady.</i>

MULLIGAN: <i>Well, that's too bad,
because he only wants to see you.</i>

Though, in my opinion, you had
your chance with Kasady

and you blew it.

Right, um, so...
what does he want?

Maybe he wants
to spill the beans

about where the missing bodies
are buried.

So you're gonna have to do
the right thing for a change.

[GRUNTS SOFTLY]

[VENOM SNARLS]

VENOM:
No!

Take your tiny hands off of me!

We should be out there
protecting the city lethally!

[VENOM SNARLS]
[CLATTERING]


What was that?

Unhand me!

Man should never
consent to crawl

when he has
the impulse to fly.

You are a bottom-feeder.

Be quiet.

How many times have I told you

that I want you to hide
yourself when I am working?

I am serious. It is important.

You have to show me respect.

Respect? Respect?
Yes. Yes.

Okay.
Okay.

Kasady gonna give you
the scoop, right?

Right.
Wrong.

What do you mean?
Because you blow everything.

Oh, okay, I see.

You're talking
about Anne again.

I miss her!

I will do it.

I don't like you.

VENOM:
<i>Let me eat him!</i>

You do not deserve nice things.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

CLETUS:
<i>Welcome back, Eddie Brock.</i>

I've been thinking about you.

What do you want, Cletus?

I mean, why am I here?

Do a man who's buried alive
a kindness, won't you?

Get a message out to all my...

fans.

And in return,
I'll give you my life.

What?

Story.

I heard the written word

hasn't been working out
so well.

Piece like this,
an exclusive...

[CLEARS THROAT]
...would put you back on top.

Go on.

People love...

serial killers.

All my secrets laid bare,
Eddie.

So much carnage.

But why me?

I like you.

All right, it's a deal.

[CLEARS THROAT]
What's your message?

[PAPER RUSTLING]

That distant cathedral

is all I see...
Mm-hmm.

<i>...fractured angel</i>

<i>the other part of me.</i>

Print that in your column.

Is that it? This, um...
Who's gonna...

Who's gonna read that,
some random haiku?

Print it,

and what's mine is yours.

Wow, lucky me.

Goodbye, Eddie.

Thank you.

Thank you.

VENOM:
<i>What a dick.</i>

<i>Eddie, look. Look.</i>

EDDIE [WHISPERS]:
What are you doing?

VENOM:
<i>Your job for you.</i>

CLETUS:
Eddie.

Don't forget me, Eddie.

[COUGHS, SNIFFS]

What did you get?

Uh, I got a headache
and probably got tuberculosis.

What? A little louder.

He read me poetry, man.

Is this some kind of joke
to you, Eddie?

Because I'm not laughing.

VENOM: <i>Yeah,
you could do with a laugh.</i>

Come on, man.

These things, they just take
a little time, all right?

Well, the second
he gives you something...

Of course.

Keep me ahead of the curve,
Eddie.

Don't embarrass me.
All right.

[ENGINE STARTS]
Do you understand?

EDDIE:
Trust me, the only scoop

I'm getting today
is double chocolate chip.

VENOM:
<i>No! I get brain freeze.</i>

[ENGINE REVS, TIRE SQUEALS]

VENOM:
<i>Come here.</i>

<i>Look.</i>

I'm looking.
<i>Grab those.</i>

All right.

Whoa. Okay.


VENOM:
<i>Now, what do you think?</i>

I think I'm Pablo Picasso.
<i>No!</i>

Okay.
<i>Come here. Look.</i>

[GRUNTING RAPIDLY]

<i>Well, say what you see.</i>
Uh, it's a house.

VENOM:
<i>Never mind.</i>

Oh, I know this one.

It's a tree.
<i>Idiot.</i>

<i>Sit down.</i>

<i>Now, pay attention.</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

VENOM:
<i>Bingo.</i>

Holy cow.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

REPORTER: Would you say your
friendship with Cletus Kasady

is what allowed you to solve
this decades-old mystery?

You are the only person
from the outside world

he's spoken with.

Seems he likes you.

Well, you know,
he's a serial killer.

I don't see how
he can like anyone.

REPORTER [VOICE-OVER]:
<i>Brock was able to uncover</i>

<i>what the FBI and police
could not.</i>

<i>Bowing to public outrage,</i>

<i>the governor of California
has overturned his moratorium</i>

<i>and reinstated
the death penalty for Kasady.</i>



<i>Brock's career has been given
a much-needed revival,</i>

<i>putting him back on top
once more.</i>

[ENGINE REVVING]

[NEWS THEME PLAYS]

REPORTER 2: <i>A harrowing story
finally comes to an end.</i>

<i>Vindication for the victims
and closure for the families.</i>

<i>Thanks to the diligence
of one man.</i>

<i>Thank you, Eddie Brock.</i>
VENOM: And Venom.

You know,
this could be us, Eddie.

Going out there, solving cases,
fighting bad guys.

Maybe I eat them, hmm?

And then we save the day.

EDDIE: <i>But we saved the day.
It's done.</i>


You said I could eat bad guys!

[SNARLING]
<i>This again?</i>

I need to be free,

feeling the wind in my hair
and the sand between my toes.

<i>You don't have any hair.</i>

You are not listening to me.

<i>Oh, I'm listening.</i>

I cannot live
like this anymore.

I'm starving.
<i>So eat those guys.</i>

VENOM: I can't.
[CHICKENS CLUCKING]

Sonny and Cher
are best friends.

EDDIE: <i>Are you serious?
That's ridiculous. That's what...</i>

[YELLS, GROANS]

Man, that was abusive.

That was abuse.


And that's a $2,000 TV.

You have got to get control
of your aggression.

That is why we have Snookie!

<i>I cannot live on chicken
and chocolate alone.</i>

<i>I need brains.</i>

Chickens have brains.

<i>I most passionately disagree.</i>

<i>Look.</i>

<i>Look at those poor idiots.</i>

[CHICKENS CLUCKING]

<i>Small brains.</i>

Come on, man, it's not
their fault that you, uh...

you live on
the old phenylethyla...

laphenylethylan.
<i>Phenylethylalanine.</i>

Yeah, I just...
I just said that.

<i>I've told you a thousand times,</i>

<i>because it is only found...</i>
Yeah?

<i>...in brains and in chocolate.</i>
And in chocolate.

That's right. All right,
well, how about this?

You live in my body,
you live by my rules.

<i>I live in your body because...</i>
Why?

<i>...unfortunately,
I don't have many options.</i>

Well, how about this, son?

The FBI is still
investigating us

for all of that stuff that
"we were involved with,"

so if one more head
goes missing,

we will get hauled off
into Area 51.

They will kill us both.

So somebody has to be
responsible.

<i>Responsibility...
it's for the mediocre.</i>

<i>Food!</i>
Can you stop doing that?

<i>Food! Food!</i>
Please just stop doing that now.

Come on, stop doing that.
<i>Food!</i>

I have a deadline! Will you...
<i>Food...!</i>

Goddamn it! Fine!

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

[BELL JINGLES]

Good evening, Eddie.
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

Good evening, Venom.
[VENOM SPEAKS MANDARIN]

EDDIE:
He says hi. Oh.

MRS. CHEN:
Chocolate hasn't arrived yet.

VENOM: <i>No!</i>
Oh, no. We have a deal.

What's gonna happen?
You gonna stop protecting me?

I don't think so.

I've been keeping
my mouth shut,

feeding your little secret.
Wow.

Little old Mrs. Chen is
a little old blackmailer, huh?

Less of the old. I am 39.

VENOM: <i>And I am Barry Manilow.</i>
Right.

VENOM:
<i>I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen.</i>

No, no, you cannot eat
Mrs. Chen.

What?
Well, I guess it's gonna have to be plan B.

What's plan B?

Aah! Not this again!
[CHICKENS CLUCKING]

I need human brains to survive.

EDDIE: <i>Uh-uh.
Now, pick up some chickens, man.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>


[CHICKENS SCREECHING]


[WHEEZING, COUGHING]

I'm done with this grossness.

Look at all the amazing things
that we can do.

We are wasting our talent.

[WOMAN WHIMPERING, GRUNTING]

Bad guy.

VENOM: Hello, kitty.
[GASPING, WHIMPERING]

EDDIE:
<i>Leave him. Leave him be.</i>

<i>Leave him be! Leave him be!</i>
[SCREAMING]

I shall remove your head.
EDDIE: <i>No, you won't.</i>

I will use it for bowling!
<i>No, you will not.</i>

VENOM:
I will take it to...

What is the one
that we like, Eddie?

EDDIE:
<i>It's Lucky Strike.</i>

Yes! Lucky Strike!
EDDIE: <i>Put him down!</i>

I will take you
to Lucky Strike,

and I will score
a 300-point game.

EDDIE: <i>You won't.</i>
The rest of your pudgy little

boy body will be left here...
[MUGGER WHIMPERING]

...rolling around
in dumpster juice.

EDDIE: <i>Oh, God.</i>
[SNARLS]

<i>No! Put him down!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,</i>

<i>no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>
[SCREAMING]

EDDIE:
<i>No!</i>

VENOM:
Fine!

EDDIE:
<i>She didn't want our help.</i>

She did not know
she needed our help, Eddie.

There is a difference.

[PHONE RINGING]

VENOM:
<i>It is Anne.</i>

<i>Anne is on the phone, Eddie!</i>
[EDDIE GASPS, WHIMPERS]

Hey, Anne.

ANNE:
<i>Hey, E-Eddie. Hi.</i>

<i>Hi.</i>
VENOM: <i>Be nice to her.</i>

ANNE:
<i>You sound out of breath.</i>

I'm-I'm not catching you
at a bad time, am I?

No, no, not at all.
I'm just, uh...

I'm just hanging around.
<i>Okay.</i>

Uh, I'm-I'm sorry
I haven't returned your calls.

I guess...

I just needed a little space
after the whole...

alien biting a guy's
head off thing, so...

VENOM:
<i>Ah, the good old days.</i>

Anyway, so I have some news,

and-and I was wondering
if we could meet.

VENOM: <i>Yes!</i>
Yeah, sure, that would be, uh...

<i>That would be fine. Great.</i>

Okay, great.
Uh, how's tomorrow night?

Tomorrow night? Yeah, great.

<i>8:00?</i>
L'AraignÃ©e?

Okay, great.
Looking forward to it.

Oh... Yeah, okay.
Me, too. Bye.

Great.

VENOM:
<i>It's over with the doctor!</i>

<i>That is the voice of a woman</i>

<i>who just got brutally dumped.</i>
[WHIMPERS]

<i>â™ª All right â™ª</i>

["HOWLIN' FOR YOU"
BY THE BLACK KEYS PLAYING]

<i>â™ª Yeah... â™ª</i>

Stop.

VENOM: <i>Don't you want
to look your best?</i>

Just leave me alone.
You are always nitpicking.

[QUIET CHATTER]

Wow.

Hey.

Hey.

[LAUGHING] Okay. Hi.
Yeah.

Wow.

VENOM:
<i>Awkward.</i>

So, uh, h-how's it going?
How's, uh...

How's Mr. Belvedere? Yeah.
Uh, good, good.

You know, he's still wiping
his ass on the carpet.

He learned that from you.
[CHUCKLES]

Yeah, how-how's, uh...
how's the legal aid work going?

Well, you know how much
I love an underdog, so...

Yeah. Yeah, that's why you...

put up with me
for so long, huh?

You said it.

S-So...
So...

VENOM:
<i>So?</i>

I don't know, I-I thought
it would be better

to tell you in person that...

Uh-huh.

VENOM:
<i>No!</i>

Wow. Oh, Anne.

Wow, that is, uh...

that is so much bigger
than the...

the one that I got you.

VENOM:
<i>Ugh, it's gaudy.</i>

That's Dan, right?
Doc-Doctor Dan.

Yeah, that... it's Dan.

Holy shit, Anne. Way to go.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm okay.

VENOM: <i>Well, I am not okay.</i>
Yeah.

You could just say,
"Congratulations.

I'm happy for you."

You know, like two people

who still care enough
about each other to lie

so that the other one doesn't
feel like complete shit. I...

Maybe we could do
that version of this?

No, I am...
I am happy for you, Anne.

You know, I'm, uh...
VENOM: <i>No.</i>

Congratulations.

Thank you.

VENOM:
<i>That was going to be us, Eddie.</i>

<i>I, for one, would not
be inconsolable</i>

<i>if Dan were to fall
into traffic</i>

<i>and lose his head and his feet</i>

<i>and all of his teeth!</i>
What?

What was that?

What? Nothing.

Whoa.

If I ask you a question,

do you have the ability
to tell me the truth?

You mean as in being

super happy for you
because of your engagement?

Because, I mean,
you just told me to lie,

so that's really,
really confusing.

Is Venom with you?

He's dead.

VENOM: <i>I am.
I'm playing dead right now.</i>

Yeah, I mean, he...

Right.
Okay.

Okay.
Okay.

Well, that's...

You just don't change, do you?

What are you talking about?
This is just a...

It's a huge shock.
Um, I'm in...

Anne, I'm in love with you.
This is a lot to process.

No, the truth is you don't
love anybody. You can't.

Commitment's just not
your thing.

All right, then, fine.

Do not marry Dan.

Dan makes me feel safe.
Ugh.

Okay, and you made me feel
like I was on a roller coaster.

And sometimes you just
have to know when to get off.

Yeah, and not yak.
VENOM: <i>And not yak!</i>

You know, not yak.

Yak.

ANNE:
Hey, Venom.

Take care of him, all right?

Don't let him keep
messing everything up.

VENOM: <i>I'm going to make you cry
now, Eddie.</i>

<i>She will love it.</i>

<i>Cry. Cry.</i>

It's a lot to process.


Congratulations, Anne.

It's great news.

[HORN HONKING]

[TIRES SQUEAL]

VENOM:
<i>Slow down, pal.</i>

EDDIE:
Why?

You don't believe
in consequences.

No injuries. You fix them.

No hangovers. You mend them.

I couldn't even hurt myself
if I tried.

[HORN HONKING]
[TIRES SQUEALING]

VENOM: <i>Eddie, I apologize
that I can't mend the heart.</i>

<i>Emotional pain,
it hits much harder,</i>

<i>and it lasts longer.</i>

<i>You just need to pull up
your big-boy pants and take it.</i>

Yeah, well, that's easy
for you to say.

<i>Why?</i>

Because I'm a real boy

and you're just an amoeba.

VENOM:
<i>I will only take that</i>

<i>because we are hurting
right now.</i>

[ENGINE RUMBLING]

<i>Don't worry, buddy.
I will get you through this.</i>

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Do you know what always
cheers me up

in the morning, Eddie?

[CYCLING THROUGH STATIONS]
Sausages and brains.

CLETUS: Oh, happy day for
you, Eddie Brock.

[EDDIE SNIFFS]
Mm, what a scoop.

The end of the Magical...

Misery Tour.

I worry for your soul.

How will you live
with the weight

of snuffing out a man's life?

I was, uh... I was hoping

maybe you could give me
a couple pointers.


Funny little guy, aren't you?

[BEEPS]
VENOM: <i>Don't need that.</i>

<i>My memory is outstanding.</i>

<i>Rude.</i>

Consequences.

Every decision you ever make.

Who do we leave behind,

and how do we leave them?

A connubial bed, empty,

waiting in the darkness

for the rescuer
who never comes.

Because of you.

VENOM:
<i>This guy makes zero sense.</i>

You and I are the same.

No. No, we're not.

Twisted insides, mean daddies.

You feel like home to me,
Eddie, like family.

And really, truly,

that is all I ever wanted
in this world.

Family.

Well, killing your grandmother
and your mother

sure is a funny way
of showing it.

Anything you want to unburden
yourself with before...

...um, this happens?

Yes.

I have wishes
to bestow upon you.

VENOM:
<i>Oh, that is kind.</i>

I want to wish you...

this heartbreak.

VENOM:
<i>Uh-oh. Too late.</i>

I wish for you
to see out your days alone,

as you always have been.

VENOM:
<i>Watch it, pal.</i>

Wh-Where are you going
with this?

You are a cancer

to everyone
who ever loved you, Eddie.

Deceived your trusting fiancÃ©e.

And no wonder Daddy
could never look at you again

after you killed his wife,
your mother,

just by being born.

VENOM:
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

No, no! No, no, no, don't!
Don't!

Hey, back up!

Eddie?

You're done.

Eddie Brock has a big secret.

Shut up, Kasady!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

VENOM:
<i>That may have been a mistake.</i>

EDDIE:
Shut up.

Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

I don't know anymore.

VENOM:
<i>Eddie!</i>

EDDIE: I don't want to hear
another word out your mouth.

VENOM: <i>Eddie.</i>
I don't want to hear it.

VENOM:
<i>Eddie, I am sorry.</i>

EDDIE: <i>That was his last
time on record ever.</i>

There's no more...
any words for his victims or...

You know, they're gone.

Any clues
of outstanding bodies,

we-we've lost forever
and completely.

VENOM: <i>I didn't mean to.</i>
[BLOWS NOSE]

You didn't mean to?
<i>And I said I'm sorry.</i>

You didn't mean to,
but you did it.

I mean, you just decided...
I don't know.

That's it, you did it.

You know,
you didn't even think

that we might get caught,
we might get killed?

No, you don't think about
things like that, do you?

You just think about chickens,
you think about you,

you think about what you want,
and you think about you.

<i>Let me remind you
of something, Eddie.</i>

<i>You were a loser
before I came along.</i>

<i>You were nothing.
I made you special.</i>

Oh, you made me special, huh?

Well, let me tell you
something, right?

Before you came along,
I had a life.

I didn't have chickens,
all right? But I had dreams.

Yeah, I had dreams,
and I had a fiancÃ©e,

and I had a really successful
TV show!

<i>Ah, but you destroyed all
of those things by yourself.</i>

Yeah, but you know what?
I rebuilt my life,

and now I just want to live it.
Good night.

<i>And how did you build
this new life?</i>

Hmm?
Excuse me?

Well, who found the clue
on the wall

so you could be
this big, shiny hero?

Hmm? Who found the clue?

Who?
Wow.

Yeah.

No, no, no.

This is not about
being a hero for me, man.

This is about wanting
to live in peace.

D-Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

No, you don't.

You don't understand
what I'm talking about.

Okay, this is about me
wanting to live

without you whining
in my ear all the time

about eating bad guys
or, like, nagging me about Anne

or destroying my place
or destroying my life!

Do you know how lucky you are
that I chose you?

You chose me?

Buddy, I'm the only person
that took you in

Yeah.

That's the million-dollar

his special visitor.

So, what did he tell you?

Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

Nothing about an escape plan?

Nothing about some kind

No.

Well, how come, every time,

you seem to be at the center
of these things

and then miraculously
you know nothing about it?

Maybe I'm lucky.

Yeah, right.

You-you said, um...

[CLEARS THROAT]

...the reports coming out

of San Quentin are bananas?

What-what do...
what do you mean by "bananas"?

Remember when I asked you
a similar question...

Uh-huh.
...the day you interviewed him?

Information is currency.

You of all people
should know that.

Come on.

I thought he'd come
to try to find the man

that nearly got him executed,

I'd lay low if I was you.

I'll see myself out.

"What else is Eddie Brock

"not sharing

"Now, why was it Eddie
that Cletus wanted

to witness the execution?" Huh?

Bad things happen around you.

Multiple dead bodies
at your building last year,

that bizarre outburst
at the lobster restaurant,

and only you
at the Life Foundation

when that rocket exploded.

And now Clyde's found Bonnie,

and there's a dead psychiatrist
at a facility

I knew nothing about
until today.

And people are talking
about seeing monsters.

Monsters?

you just need to tell

No. No.
No, I can't tell them

that they are chasing
a serial killer

got an alien inside of him.

And he's capable
of killing everybody.

Venom.

Talk to me. What's happening?

No, he's-he's not here.

[CLANGS BRIEFLY]






You didn't tell the world
how he was a scared little boy

that no one cared about

and no one came to save!

[EDDIE GROANING]

You never asked yourself why!
[GROANS, SCREAMS]

That's bad journalism!


[THUNDER RUMBLING]

Oh, happy days.

[GRUNTS, GROANS]

I'm not a crazy man,

but I am a vengeful one.

You're going to watch her die.



Anne! Anne!

[ANNE SCREAMING]
[CARNAGE GRUNTS]

Do something!


Eddie, I'm afraid
we cannot beat them.

[ANNE SCREAMING]

Baby, that's too much.

You got to stop him.

CLETUS:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

I'll shut her up for good.


No, stop! You're hurting her!

[MUFFLED YELLING]

EDDIE:
<i>Get up!</i>

I can't.

EDDIE:
<i>Look. Look.</i>

<i>They're not symbiotic.</i>

Get away from her!

Shut up.

<i>Get your hands off my wife!</i>

EDDIE:
<i>They're not a match.</i>

We are.

EDDIE:
<i>That's right. We are.</i>

Together, we are...

VENOM & EDDIE:

He did not taste good.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'm a killer

with or without
the monster, Eddie.

[COUGHS WEAKLY]

You know what I really wanted?

No. What was it, Cletus?

I told you,
but you weren't listening.

Well, I'm listening now.

I wanted your friendship.

I'm sorry, Cletus.

Fuck this guy.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[SIRENS WAILING]

You in there,
get him out of here.

They're gonna come
for you both.

I know.

Hey, Anne.

Take care.

Yeah, you, too, champ.

VENOM:
Dan!

You take care, too.

Thanks.

I like you.

We totally
didn't need him, though.

Honestly, I think he was more
of a hindrance than a help.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Monsters.

That there is Don Quixote,

and the guy next to him
is, uh, S-Sancho Panza.

They're two
very different people

who have very different takes
on the world.

D-Different ways
of doing things.

Sometimes they didn't like
each other a whole lot,

but ultimately...

they worked together to bring
out the best in each other.

VENOM:
<i>Eddie, the time has come.</i>

<i>I must go alone.</i>

<i>It is me they want.</i>

Yeah.

Well, my dear Sancho,

facts are the enemy of truth.

VENOM:
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

It means...

It means that we are...

frien...
VENOM: <i>Fugitives!</i>

Um, yeah. Yeah.

<i>On the run.</i>
That, too.

["LOVE WILL TEAR US APART" BY
HOT 8 BRASS BAND PLAYS QUIETLY]

Thank you
for bringing me here.

Yeah, you're welcome, buddy.

It's beautiful, huh?
Mm-hmm.

EDDIE: I'm sorry that we can't
do anything about the old

"wind in your hair"
situation, but...

Osho says,
when you love someone,

you accept the whole person...
Osho?

...with all of their defects.

"Defects." Hmm.

Nobody is perfect.

Just go back.
Go back a minute.

You telling me...
you just said that you love me.

Um...
You did.

Where will we go?

I don't know. I don't know.

Anywhere that needs
a Lethal Protector, I suppose.

Oh! You really meant it!

Yeah.

We will need a cape
and a mask.

No.

No, I think you got
that covered. We're good.
