Yo, Ug.
Nigga, put that shit out, man.

I'll show you.

I am. I'm gonna show you, for real.

I'll see you in Miami on Friday, right?

No doubt. I'm gonna be there.
All right.

Y'all get home safe.

Muah. Bye.
Bye.

Take care.
Bye, guys.

I want a big endorsement

I got you. I'll make some phone calls.

Are you ready to go, sir?

Wait. You ready to go?
Yeah.

A'ight, we out, we out.

You sure?
Yeah.

You sure?
You ready? You ready?

Yeah.

Yo, Ug, pass me that bottle, baby.

Here you go. Good looks.

Whoo. Yes, sir.

I'm saying, Sage, what is this
you got us listenin' to, man?

Yo, you got to keep an open mind, man.

I hear all that, man,
but, yo, check this out.

Unh.

Yo, I'm saying, man, what's up
with that meeting at Atlantic?

Hey, 12:00 Monday, man.
Jason Flom is feelin' us.

Plus he even took a copy of the CD.

Okay.

We're good to go.

Yo, Ug.

Keep Luther on a leash.

Yo, in and out, nigga.
Yo, I'm not playin', a'ight?

I don't want no fucking bodies.

A'ight, man.
I got you, I got you.

You good?

Let's do it.

Come on, Luther.
We got to behave ourselves tonight.

Motherfuckers is acting sensitive and shit.

Let's rock.

Get the fuck out the car.

Yo. Don't shoot.
Aah. Aah.

Chill. Chill, man.

You know what the fuck this is.
Come about your shit.

All right.

Aah. No. Please don't.
Please don't.

Yo, give a nigga a heads-up next time.

Business is between those who do it.

Aah. Oh, no.
Please don't do it.

Don't do it.
Oh, my God. Ohh.

Take this, man.
Just don't shoot.

That's a real pretty necklace.

Where'd you get that from?

I bet you somebody real special-

Aah. Aah.

Oh. Oh, my God.
Please don't kill me.

Oh, my God.
Please don't kill me.

Nigga...

Nigga, you fuckin' retarded, or what?.

What the fuck did I tell you?.

What the fuck, Sage?.
You said no one would get hurt.

Sage. Sage. Is that you?.

I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I love you.

I'm so sorry.

Please.
What you want me to do?

Please don't kill me. Aah.

Oh, no. Please don't do it.

Please don't kill me.
Oh, my God.

I'm not a rapper.

Though that perception
could be easily ascertained...

...from the outside, looking in.

I'm inclined to ask the question -...

...when I'm hungry and I make
myself something to eat,

does that make me a chef?

Or when I go to the playground
to shoot hoops,

does that make me a ballplayer?

I don't think so.

But for those into xicated
by these misconceptions...

...of who or what I am, I say to you...

...if you must define me...

...define me as a businessman,
a capitalist, a boss.

In a city of 9 million people,

where many see obstacles,
I see opportunities...

Like many other bosses,

has the ability to see 10 steps ahead,

figure out all the angles...

...and has the ungodly talent...

...of detecting, dissecting,
dismantling, dismissing...

...all potential problems and dangers...

...before it ever occurs.

When you're responsible for the livelihood...

...and welfare of others,

many times you're faced
with decisions and choices...

...the average soul can neither
comprehend nor condone.

But like the saying goes -...

...let your conscience be your guide.

And it's exactly that to which I abide.

So, as I struggle with my own demons...

...and try not to judge those who judge me,

I take comfort in knowing
one thing is undeniable -...

...everybody has a hustle.

What's yours?

Ah, yes, man. What you want?

I got all the mixtapes.
I got them.

I got the - the good movies
with the good quality, all new.

W- what you want?
You want CD or DVD?

You ain't got that superhead joint, right?

The superman?

No, man.
Never mind, yo.

Ah.

Yes, man.
That's my number-one seller.

I sold out of those last week.
I just got those.

Sold them shits all out, huh?

All of them.
I give you for two for $10.

Being that you sold them all out, homey,

I guess I'm here to collect
what you owe me.

What you talking about, man?

Listen, I'm the one who's in charge
of selling these shits...

...to you smelly
motherfuckers out here, man.

And I know I didn't sell any to you, right?

So you must've copied these shits
on your own, dawg.

So why don't you just give me
what you owe me, man?

What you talking about, man?
You crazy.

A'ight, look, check this, right?

Since you seem to be doing
so well out here,

I'm gonna sell you more
for double the price, dawg,

'cause you fucked up.

But I like you, though,
so I'm willing to do you that favor.

I owe you nothing.
I don't want your business.

You get away from my table.
You get out of here.

And here I thought
you was a smart guy, Ziggy.

Now, you're a lucky man I got places to be,

or we'd have a real problem,
feel me?

Yo, when I come back, man,

I suggest you change
that attitude of yours, yo,

but for now,
I'm just gonna take my shit.

You take nothing. Ay.

Hey, yo, G, man,
I got places to be, yo.

Come on.
Let's beat out, man.

A'ight, man, listen, look,

when you're done, yo,
grab the CDs.

I'll be waiting for you in the car, man.

Some 'old skool' shit, man.

Nice.

What's going on, fellas?

Hi, Mr. Blanche. I'm raising money
for my basketball team,

and I want to know
if you want to make a donation.

Okay. How's your grades?

They're all right.

What about you?
Sort of good.

Sort of good, huh?

A'ight, I'll tell you what.

You guys keep them grades up
and put me down for $100 each.

$100?
Yeah.

All right.
All right?

All right, y'all take it easy.

All right. Thank you.
All right.

And don't ring the bell so early, either.

Thalia. Wake up.

What's up, baby?

What's up is you said you was
gonna clean this room today.

Hmm.

Come on, Cart. I'm tired.

I'll do it later when I wake up.

You said that yesterday, Thalia.

Just like you said
you was gonna do the kitchen.

You still gonna hit the dishes up
at least, right?

Don't know why I bother with it.

Thalia.

Unh.

Ohh.

You awake now?

Uh-huh.

Good.

Get your ass up and clean the house.

Hey, I need you to go
into work for me today.

What?. Why?

It's Saturday.

I know what today is.
Bank got Saturday hours, right?

Yeah, the bank does,
but Thalia doesn't.

Yeah, well, Thalia does this Saturday.

I got some dough laying around.
I need you to take care of it.

I don't want it sitting till Monday, a'ight?

That's Max.
Put a robe on.

Yo, I'm telling you, man.

Everybody's amped
about your tournament this year.

All right. That's what's up, man.

That means we should have
an even better turnout this year.

Yo, you going to get Uglyman right now?

Yep. Going to get him.

Been seven years, man.
Long time.

Tell that dude to come holla at me, man.

I know his hairline is like back here.

I know how them jail niggas cut.

Put the money in the bag.

Stop pouting, you big baby.

Fuck you.

Can you hold up for a sec?

Wait a second.

Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

Just try to remember
I'm not one of your fucking friends.

Right.

Okay?

Okay.

Everything good, my dude?

Yeah, everything's cool, man.

Listen, you're shooting out
to Queens, right?

Yeah.

I need you to do me a favor...

...and drop me by my daughter's crib
in Rosedale.

She's mad at me, man.

Hey, we can't win, man.

No. Exactly.

Hey, yo, um...

Tell your man Douglas
I never got that receipt...

...for the cash I gave him.

Receipt?

Yeah, for the cash I gave him
for the tournament.

Cash?

Yeah, he said I had to give him cash...

'cause we were late getting him a check.

A'ight. I'll tell him.

A'ight. Cool.

You know, she really is mad at you.

Yeah, I know.

She gave me the Andrea attitude earlier.

I'm saying, what, do you make
her practice that or something?

'cause she's good at it already.

You are lucky that's all you got
some nights, Mr. Blanche.

Ask Al Green what a pot of hot grits
feels like, okay?

You got off with a nice cold shoulder.

Cold shoulder?

Andrea, I still get headaches...

...from you yapping in my ear
about what I need to do.

Like you didn't deserve it.

If I ever see you again with that no-good -

Now, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, killer. Calm down.

Boy, you better stop playin'.

No, I know, I know.
I don't want no problems.

Hey.

You mad at Daddy?

Come on, you know
you can't stay mad at Daddy.

I told you I'll take you
to the American Girl store...

...next weekend.

It'll be open on Saturday. I promise.

Hello.

Took you long enough.

Shut up.

Hey.
You love me now?

Yes, but I still want to go
to the American Girl store.

Behave.

Yeah, I'm going to pick up this dude
from upstate today.

You know what I mean?
Have him back on the streets.

Might throw a little something
for him tonight.

So, um, nah, basically,
it's all that, yeah.

It is what it is.

A'ight. One.

Mr. Cart Blanche. My dude.
What's up, baby?

J.B. What's good, playa?

Yeah, you see what's good with me.

A'ight.

Yes, sir. Ooh.

Looking good.

Yo, baby.

So, that's it, huh?

Yes, sir.
Okay, okay.

She's hot, man.

Yo, good looking out, man.

Your people hooked me up...

...with the VIN numbers and everything.

Cleaned the titles down south.

I ain't got to worry
about a goddamn thing, baby.

That's what's up.
Yeah.

But, um...

I kind of wanted to talk to you...

...about the numbers and everything, man.

What did Dell tell you?

Come on, man.
You know I'm a baller on a budget.

Look, a-a'ight,
he called me a price, man.

It was kind of high,
but I thought I'd talk to you.

Man, we got history.

You know, we could
work something out, man.

Talk to Dell, man.

Come on, man. You used to fuck
with my sister, man.

Yo, man, we go back
like Whitney Houston and crack.

Baby, come on, man. It's me.
Talk to Dell.

Yo, homey,
I'm talking right here, dawg.

Hey, hold up, man. I'm talking.

That's what it is, man.

What's up, man.
I'm glad to hear it, man.

A'ight, a'ight. Yeah.

You said you was gonna spit for him.

You got something for me, man?
Mm-hmm.

Okay, okay.
Yo, man, I spit miraculous.

Yo, yo.

Yo, what is this, man?

'Showtime at the Apollo' or somethin'?

Yo, I got one word for you, B.

'Chorus,' man. Got to learn
how to write a hook, B.

You ain't never gettin' signed like that, man.

Hey, you ready to go, boss, man?

Yeah, yeah, we good, man.

Fellas, fellas, man.
Sounds good, though, man.

Don't give it up, bro.

A'ight? Y'all stay up, man.

A'ight.

Yo, you a funny dude.

Dell, man.

Ah, damn, man.

You went above and beyond...

...when I told you to find a piece of shit.

Man. Shit all tight.

Yo, man, this shit remind me
of this whip I had...

...when I was in high school, man.

Yo, we used to call it 'P.O.S.'
stood for 'piece of shit.'

That's what we're gonna do.

We're gonna call this joint 'P.O.S. Jr.'

Yo, what the fuck is up
with this radio, man,

this Spanish 'Vida m ia' shit?

Where'd you get this car from -
Washington Heights?

Are we even gonna make it
up there in this?

What?

This is my mom's car.

It's your mo-

Yo, my bad, yo.

I mean, it gets her
from point 'A' to point 'B,' right?

That's all that matters.

Nigga, you know this car's
a piece of shit, dawg.

Yo, but how you gonna play
her car like that, though?

Yo, how you gonna
let your mom ride around...

...in some shit like this, man?

Come on.
With all the paper we getting?

You got to have her in something
better than this, man.

Yo, you're a horrible son, man.

Can you pull off, please?

Hey, you really think I'm a horrible son?

Uh, yeah.

Yo, that shock-camp shit ain't no joke, man.

I'm telling you, yo.

Now that I think about it, man,
it might be worse...

...than going to the motherfucking
marines or something, yo.

All them poor cats want to be doing
is push-ups in the morning.

At shock camp, though,

you got a bunch of drug dealers
and crackheads...

...running around acting
like they're soldiers,

working out all the goddamn time, man.

Shit don't make no sense to me at all.

I didn't even work out
when I was in gym class, man,

let alone in there.

Yo, if it wasn't for them cuttin'
my 3-to-5 down to 6 months, Cart,

I'm telling you, man, I might have
dropped one of them C.O.'s, for real.

What is this,
a medium-security joint?

Big motherfuckin' Carter Blanche.
What up, baby?.

Big Ug. What's the deal, player?

Goddamn, why y'all park
all the way down here, man?

Goddamn. What the fuck, player?

Thought I was gonna have to take
a cab down this motherfucker, man.

Damn.

Same old Ug. Still complaining.

What's good, boy?

Ain't shit, man.
What up with you, man?

Nothin', man. I see that jailhouse
workout never fails, bro.

Get out of here with that shit.

You know a nigga like me
wasn't working out.

But you looking good yourself,
superstar.

Yo, Cart, the whole time I was up in here,

all I heard was niggas bumpin' your shit.

Yo, the buzz is crazy up here,
baby, for real.

I told you, man.
That's what it is, bro.

I'm glad to be out this motherfucker.

I ain't coming back to this bitch, for real.

I'm glad to hear that, man,

'cause I got a lot of shit
that needs to be done,

and I need you to be on point.

No doubt, baby. I'm here.

This is Dell. This is the cat
I was telling you about.

He's been holding me down
since you been gone.

What's good, man?

What's good, man?
I heard a lot about you, B.

It's good to finally meet you, man.

No doubt.

A'ight, let's get up out of here, man,

before they find a reason
to keep all three of us.

Yo, Cart.
What the fuck is this, man?

Yo, I know you can be-
Wait. Hold on. What's the word.

I know you can be frugal at times,
but what the fuck is this, B?

Somebody's been reading the Webster's.

I mean, yo,
look at the fucking bumper.

It got a band-aid on it.

What you want me to do, man?
Come up here in a Bentley?

Next thing you know,
we got all type of heat on us?

No, thanks, man.
You can have that.

No, man, I'm not saying that.

I'm just saying I thought
I was gonna hit the streets...

...in some stylin' shit,
in some 'oh, shit' type shit.

What the fuck is this, man?

You got tape
all on the motherfucker - damn.

Yo, this is my mom's car, man.

Say word?

Yeah.

Yo, Cart, what the fuck
are you paying these cats, man?

Yo, what the fuck?

Is it like the Great Depression out here?

Well, fuck it. At least let me
whip this motherfucker.

No, man, I'm cool.
I'm gonna do the driving, yo.

Why don't you just sit in the back
and relax, man?

You just got out,
and we got a long ride.

Nigga, you act like
if I hit something in this shit,

you're gonna be able to tell.

It's like I said, man.
I usually do the driving, yo.

Come on, son.
Yo, I ain't drove in seven years.

That's exactly why your ass
is getting in the back,

so we can make it in one piece.

Y'all got plenty of time to argue
about who's driving, man. Let's go.

Yo, all I'm saying is this motherfucker
better not break down.

That's all the fuck I'm saying.

What the fuck is this, son?
Damn.

Hey, baby.

Hey, what up? What up?
Welcome home.

Thank you. Thank you.
How are you?

Good, good.

Hey, yo, this is my man, El.

What's up?
What's good? How are you?

Yeah, this is what the fuck I'm talkin' about.

Yo, Ug.
Come here, man.

Yo, give me a minute.

What up, son?

Who the fuck is that?

Oh, that's my man, El.

Yo, dawg, what,
you slip and bump your head?

You know how I feel about niggas
I don't know coming in my crib.

My fault, Cart. Yo, I didn't mean
no disrespect by this.

Listen, yo, he just moved
down here from Rochester.

And, man, when we was locked up,

the nigga held me down,
kept the flies off me.

So I figured fuck it,
I'd bring him through to meet you.

I mean, shit - he been hearing about you...

...for the last seven years.

Porno mags, towels, all that shit.

My man, you playing?

Yeah.

So, you gonna put up or something?
What the fuck?

And when we didn't have shit to play for,

we'd play for push-ups.

But the best shit was push-ups on demand.

That was the shit.

On demand? What the fuck
is you talking about, man?

If you lose,
you got to give me my push-ups...

...whenever I want, wherever I want,
however many I want.

But we had to start
putting rules on that shit...

'cause niggas was getting sent to the box...

...for doing push-ups on the mess-hall line.

Stupid motherfuckers.

That shit's crazy.

Yeah. We put on some real shit.

Yo, my man, El, from Rochester,

that motherfucker owed me
like 20 push-ups.

Well, I stretched that shit out
over four years.

I'd see the nigga and be like,
'Yo, give me five push-ups.

No, no, matter of fact,
hold them last two till tomorrow.'

you know what I'm saying?

I made the nigga do a half a push-up.

You got to see that.
That's some funny shit.

Showtime. $150.
What you want to do?

And it wasn't just - you
know what I mean -...

...it ain't like we just did it with card games.

We was betting on sporting events.

Niggas was betting on hockey.
Didn't even fucking like hockey.

But the funniest shit
was during the football season.

Yo, you'd see mad motherfuckers...

...in the yard the next morning,
Monday morning,

trying to get them push-ups
out in the fucking cold.

Shit was crazy.

Tell 'em, Dell.

You was sent up, right?

Wait. You did that boot-camp shit.

What was that, like three weeks?

Nah. Try six months, dawg.

Oh, excuse me. Six months.

That's county time, dawg.

Shit. Call it what the fuck
you want, Uglyman.

At least I was home, dawg.

Oh, 'At least I was home.'

Yo, son, what the fuck is you doin', man?

You can't smoke in Cart's crib.

'What the fuck is you doin'?
You can't smoke in Cart's crib.'

Don't worry about me, motherfucker.

Just worry about your little fucking cards.

Hey, baby, you want another drink?

Hello?
What?

I'm about to go in the kitchen.
You want another drink?

All right. Yeah.

Let me get one, man.

Yo, are you trying to get me killed?.
What the fuck are you doing here?.

You got to be, like, the most obvious
FBl agent in the world.

You're gonna get us both killed.

Where you been, Thalia?

We haven't heard from you in a while.

I was starting to get
a little worried about you.

Yeah, well,
Carter's been very busy,

and I've been with him most of the time.

So, I mean, fuck,
it's been kind of hard...

...to get in contact with y'all.

Yeah, I know.
He's been very busy.

You got anything new?

Yeah, they got this basketball
tournament coming up,

and, I mean, they're gonna have...

...a whole bunch of new sponsors there.

So, I don't know, check that out.

Sponsors, huh? W-where did
they get these sponsors from?

Probably Douglas Beck.

Douglas Beck.

Yeah, he's like Cart's business consultant,

spokesperson, or some shit.

I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

I just know that Cart and Dell
be talking about him all the time.

How come you haven't
mentioned him before?

I don't know.
I guess I fuckin' forgot.

Well, maybe I should forget
that in exchange...

...for not going to prison
for money laundering,

you're helping me with this investigation.

Do you know what the bank
that you work for would do...

...if they found out?

See what I'm saying?

Ohh.

Looks like they got
a nice big party going on in there.

Is there anything I should know about?

Ain't shit going on in there...

...but a bunch of drunk-ass niggas
talkin' shit.

So, if bullshit was a crime,

then, yeah, go lock them all up forever.

I don't give a fuck.

They're just throwing a party
for Cart's boy, Uglyman.

He just got out of jail.

Oh, that must be, uh,
Thomas Robinson.

Damn. Y'all motherfuckers
know everything.

What you need me for?

Well, see, Thalia,
these are the things...

...we need to be kept informed about.

We have a deal.

Maybe I should put a wire on you.

Oh, hell, no. Where you gonna
put a wire in this outfit?

Y'all need anything to drink?

Nah, I'm good, man.

Nah.

No.
I'm good, shorty.

Yo, Dell, give little man a tip.

I ain't got shit left.

Never mind, man.

Here you go, little man.

Sorry. I was talking to Lala.

A'ight, fellas.
Royal flush, motherfuckers.

Again, man?

Hate to keep doing it to y'all, man.

So, I'm saying, Ug,
what's gonna happen next?

I got to make y'all bet push-ups
being that I'm taking all your paper?

Fuck around, I'll have y'all...

...looking like full force
out this motherfucker.

Fuck.

I can't be playing
with these scrub-ass niggas, B.

Aw, nigga, stop complaining, man.

You control your own game.
If you lose, it's on you.

And put that shit out in my house.

Man, what the fuck
is you laughing at, seat filler?

What you sayin'?

Nigga, you heard what the fuck I said.

Hey, yo, man. Yo, both y'all
sit y'all asses down, man.

What's the problem?

Niggas got million-dollar dreams
and dollar thoughts, man.

You over here talking about push-ups.

You talking about boot camp, man.

You need to be worried
about the next score.

You need to pull up y'all skirts...

...and stop acting
like a bunch of bitches, man.

Y'all arguing about who lost worse.

Y'all both suck equally, a'ight?

I got all the damn chips, man.
For real.

And you.

Don't fuck up my night, okay?

I'm saying, Cart,
we're just talkin' shit, you know?

That's what I'm saying, man.

And, you, let me get at you for a minute.

Hey, yo, man, why you doin' that?

What?

'What'? Why you goin' at Dell like that?

Aw, man, I'm just havin' some fun
with the little nigga,

testin' his nerve.

Being sure he is who he say he is.

He is. You know why?
'Cause I said he is.

I know how you feelin', man,

but I told you there's enough for everybody.

You need to leave that dumb shit alone.

Nigga, you home.

I mean, come on, Ug,
you need to calm down, man.

I need your head in the game.
Things are different out here now.

You've been gone a long time.
Streets ain't gettin' no easier.

See, but that's what the fuck
I'm talking about,

'cause that's where we need to be.

I mean, what the fuck is this
'Cart the rapper' shit any fuckin' way?

Everybody in New York
want to be a fuckin' rapper.

Yo. You're not foolin' nobody, nigga.

You're a criminal just like the rest of us.

Man, fuck this B.E.T. Shit.
Let's do what we do best.

Let's get that motherfuckin' work,
hit the block,

and get that motherfuckin' money, man.

Yo, who the fuck you think
you're talking to, man?

Yo, Ug, the '90s is over.
Look around you.

Shit, nigga, look at me.
Dig in your pockets, man.

I put that money there.

How many niggas you know
could come home and say that?

Everybody talk about gettin' paper.

At the end of the day,
who's really gettin' it?

Go find them niggas
we was hustlin' with years ago...

...and see how many of them are starving.

I look hungry to you?

Hey, yo, fuck this, man.

Yo, you want to continue eatin',
adjust, nigga.

Bottom line.

Yo, man, I want to say thank you
for sending Thalia up there...

...with that money and shit.

That was some real shit.

Those was the only visits a nigga got.

Yo, it's a small thing, man.
You know I would've if -

Nah, don't worry about it.
I know you would've if you could've.

I mean, I'm not even talking about you.

I'm talkin' about Lynn.
You seen her?

Nah. Heard she moved out to Brooklyn.

Word. Brooklyn?
You know where?

You're not going to Brooklyn, man.

Leave that chick alone.

Nah, man, I ain't gonna check her.

But I'm saying it has been seven years.

And that's a long time.
That's a lot of this.

Do you know how much of this
that is, nigga?

A'ight, man, I know
it's been seven years, man,

but I got you covered, a'ight?

Oh, word?
Come on.

Oh, shit.

Hey, Ug, still need to keep your head
in the game, a'ight?

You like?

Why, yes. I believe I do.

Ladies, this is my boy Ug.
He just came home.

I need y'all to do me a favor...

...and give him the proper
welcome home he deserves.

I can't keep talking my way...

...out of paying for unused studio time.

He's irresponsible,
and it's his career.

I know. I-I get it.
He won a Grammy.

But that was six freakin' years ago, Charles.

What has he done since?

An episode of 'Cribs'?

Does he even still have that house?

Oh, he doesn't?

Wow. I-I was just kidding.

Anyway, that's why I was saying...

...what I said in the marketing meeting.

I know it's blasphemy
to talk bad about him,

but I'm just so fed up.

I have to speak my mind.

And if I made you look bad, I'm sorry.

Yeah. Okay.

Great. Bye.

So, Charles wasn't happy
with your anti-20 Below statements?

Nope. Not one bit.

20 Below is the bane of my existence.

I understand,
but he ain't all that bad.

And he made this label
a good deal of money,

and Charles does have
a sense of loyalty, so....

Have you heard the new tracks
on his album?

No. Not yet.

Oh, my God. They suck.

I wouldn't download those songs for free.

Who is this?

Cart Blanche.

Cart Blanche, huh?

Mm-hmm.

Ohh.

I would do him.

You're a whore.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, speaking of whores...

...that's why I'm here.

Can you take Sylvia...

...to Carson Daly's party tomorrow night?

I can't do it.

Yeah, I-I guess so.

You sure she won't feel like
she's slumming it with me?

I am the new guy.

No. She's oblivious to the world around her.

She only listens to her own music
and watches her own videos.

Hey, Monica, I've been
looking all over for you.

Oh, shit. This is Cart Blanche.

How do you know that?

You're kidding, right?

He's only the hottest
underground rapper out.

Me and my friends have all of his mixtapes.

I like 'Run For Cover, Volume 3' the best.

I guess I stand corrected.

Cart Blanche is hot.

Hey, baby.
Where are you?

Oh, my God.

Not on the whore part, though.

Well, looks like we got
a match made in heaven.

You both love Cart Blanche.
You got a lot in common.

New best friends.

Okay. I'm starving.

Um, salad?

No, I got a ton of stuff to do.
I'll grab a PowerBar.

Oh, fine. Okay.

Cool. Thank you.

No prob.

Yo, Max, what's good?

Yo, I heard from Cart
that you ran into Lynn last week.

You got an address on her?

Yeah. Yeah.
Hold up. Let me get it.

A'ight. No doubt.

What's up?
Hey.

How're you?

I'm good. How are you?

I'm all right. I'm all right.

You look so different.

Shit, girl, I've been gone for a while,
you know what I mean?

Seven years, not to mention
I was locked up for a time.

It's been a minute
since you've seen me, you know?

It has. It's been a while.

So, you want to come inside,
have something to drink?

Cool.

Oh, shit.

Bitch-ass motherfucker.

Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

Calm the fuck down, fat boy.

Where this nigga's pants at?

Y'all niggas don't know
who y'all fuckin' with.

Shut the fuck up.
Do what the fuck I told you.

Fat boy got some paper, huh?

Count it out, bitch.

Lynn, you know these motherfuckers?
You set me up.

Shut the fuck up.

I'm just sayin', G.
Seven years, man?

Homey, I know niggas who did four, man.

They was thinking about fuckin'
one of them he/shes.

Seven years, dawg?
No, real shit, man.

Nigga got some head
from a nigga or somethin', B.

Hold on, man.

This motherfucker here.

Yo, Paulie.

Yo, you are the worst promoter
in the fuckin' world, man.

I swear to God, you suck, B.

No, I'm just fuckin' with you, yo.

Yeah, I got the contract.

I'm about to take that shit
over to Cart in a little while, man.

You get my list for tonight?

A'ight, cool, baby.
That's what it is, man.

We gonna shut that bitch down,
a'ight?

Yo, who this?

Hi. Um, this is Rachel Anderson
from Highway Records.

How are you?

Highway Records?
Cool. I'm good. What's up?

Good. Well, let me get right to it.

I am feelin' Cart Blanche.

That's what's up.
We aim to please.

I got this mixtape,

and, oh, I can't stop playing it.

I mean, I haven't heard
something I like this much...

...in quite a while.

Oh, Rachel. Rachel, right?
I bet you say that to all the boys.

Not even close.

Look, Dell, I want to set up
a meeting with Cart.

Do you think that'll be possible?

Honestly, ma, we ain't really lookin'

to go the major-league route
these days at all, man.

We actually like to make money.

Call me crazy, but, uh,
we like it in the streets, man.

Shit's been good to us.

Fair enough.

All I'm asking is a chance to meet Cart...

...and let you know that we do it
a bit differently here at Highway.

Our deals are artist-centric.

So, when do you think we could meet?

Cart's schedule's mad booked, ma.
I don't know.

All I need is 10 minutes.

10 minutes, huh?
All right, we'll fuckin' check it out.

You said you feelin' the mixtape, right?

Yeah, yeah.

All right, then, well,
if you're feelin' the mixtape,

then the stage show will blow your mind.

You should come down.
It's at the pavilion tonight.

If you really want him,
we can chop it up there.

Cool. You got it.

Um...

Ohh. Shoot.

I can't. I...

I have to take one of my artists to a party.

That's a'ight. It's cool.
You can bring them, too.

If you really want to chop it up,
we gonna be at the show.

A'ight, cool, Rach.

So, I'm-a put you on the list,
plus three, a'ight?

Um...

A'ight. One.

Hey, Douglas.
Thought you got lost again.

No, I had to stop and put air in my tires.

Again? Don't you think it's time
you get a new tire?

I will. I will.

Come on in.

My wife will kill me if she finds out I ate this.

I'm sure something or someone
will beat her to that.

You're probably right.

So damn good.

Who knew mystery meat could be so tasty?

Hate to burst your bubble, bro.

Ain't no mystery to that meat.
That's turkey.

We don't do swine in this house.

No.

Why'd you have to ruin that for me?

Just plain mean.

Oh, nice phone.
When'd you get all 21st century?

Mm, my brother got it for me.

All the associates at his firm have them.

He thought it would help me
remember my appointments better.

But I'll tell you something, Carter,

I never missed an appointment
I wanted to go to.

Well, the good thing,
I can get sports scores on that.

Church will never be the same again.

A'ight. Everything looks good here.

What else you got for me?

Okay.

We're getting you out of Disney,
Syrex, and Tandem Health...

...and into Somaxon, Sharpe,
and Pfizer.

You're going extra hard on Sharpe, right?

Yeah.
You said that's the one, right?

Let's run with it.

All right, so, if that's it....

All right.

Not to say that your conversation
isn't stimulating,

but, uh, I got an appointment.

The Battery Park restaurant?

Yes.

Do you want me in on it?

Uh, no. That's all right.

But I do need you to send a check
over to Jackie at Land Rover.

I want to get a new Range Rover
for the winter.

Done and... done.

Oh, speaking of checks,

did you ever get that check from Max...

...for the basketball tournament?

Max?

Yeah, the barber.

Oh, yeah.

I did. He, uh, mailed me a check.

I... I got it the other day.

And the, uh, tournament info -
that's here, right?

I think so.

Okay.

Oh, Douglas...

I don't see it.

Mm. Here it is.

I, uh... grabbed it by mistake.

Okay. No problem.

A'ight, um...

I guess I'll talk to you a little later.

Oh.

You get that tire fixed.

Oh. I will. I will.

What's shakin', Dougie?

Ohh.

Well, either it's you,

or that delicious turkey dog
I just ate is giving me gas.

A turkey dog, huh?

You're not getting health-conscious
on me, now, are you, Douglas?

I was tricked into eating it,
thank you very much.

And a hot dog made out of turkey
just ain't right.

Mm.

It was tasty, though.

Yeah, I bet.

So, what's new?

Just go to the camera feature.

This button right here?
Yeah.

Cart doesn't say much, though.
Good luck.

It's not always what they say,
Douglas.

Ah.

Mm.

So, when are you gonna be
finished with this job?

It's only a matter of time
before he's on to me.

You're not afraid of getting caught...

...with your hand in the cookie jar,
now, are you?

Douglas...

You got to get some Tums
or something. Really.

It's not very appealing.

You need some air in that tire.

Asshole.

Damn, nigga.
What the fuck happened to you?

What the fuck it look like?

Well, it look like your ass
was playin' some jail-rules football.

Yeah, you real funny.

Now I know why Cart fuck with you.

Every king need a jester.
Clown-ass nigga.

Damn. Yo, what the fuck happened to you?

What the fuck?.
Everybody got jokes?.

Hey, yo, Ug, come here, man.

Get the fuck out my way.

Hey, Kenneth.
How are you, sweetie?

Crazy day.

You gonna be ready to go by 7:00?

Damn it.

What?

Kenneth, I totally forgot
about the screening.

What do you mean you forgot?

I have to do something for work tonight.

There's just been so much going on,
and I guess I...

I forgot.

You forgot.

Man, you got to be kiddin' me.

I'm sorry. I know.

What is it you have to do?

Remember that hip-hop artist
I said I wanted to sign?

No.

You know, the mixtape that I made for you.

That fuckin' rapper?

You know, you don't have to be so rude,

but, yes, the rapper.

So, I'm supposed to be meeting him
after his show tonight.

Do you know how hard it was
for me to get these tickets?

I know, baby, but it's really-

You know - you know what?
No, no, no. Whatever.

Bye.

Kenneth, wait.

Ha ha. New York City, man.
Talk to me.

Y'all ready for the king of New York, baby?

The king of paper chasin',
Mr. Carter Blanche.

Let's get it.

1, 2.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoa. Where you goin'?

Oh, I have a meeting with Dell.

Who are you?

Rachel from Highway Records.

Who?

Rachel from Highway Records.
He's expecting me.

Hi. And I'm Sylvia.

Hold on a second.

Yo, Dell.

There's a Rachel from Freeway -
Expressway Records?

Oh, Rachel from Highway.

Yeah, she's cool.
You can send her up, man.

You sure?
Yeah, no doubt.

All right.

All right. Go ahead.

Dell?
Rachel?

Yeah. Hi. So nice to meet you.

The show was off the hook.

Thank you.
I told you we aim to please.

Dell, this is Sylvia and Greg.

Dell is Cart's manager.

Sylvia, huh?
My ex has all of your records.

Your last album was platinum in her Honda.

Well, thank you.
Nice to meet you, Dell.

So, Dell,
can you introduce me to Cart?

Yeah. Come on.

Hey, yo, Cart.

This is Rachel, the shorty
from Highway I was tellin' you about?

Dell, what the fuck you doin', man?

These chicks fuckin'?

No, I'm just kiddin'.
Nice to meet you.

Wow, I finally get to meet
the legendary Cart Blanche.

It's a pleasure.

I don't know about the legend part, ma,

but, uh, the pleasure's definitely mine.

Oh, um, Cart,
this is one of my artists.

This is Sylvia.

How you doin'?

You killed it out there.
Your stage show - hot.

I might have to steal some of that for mine.

Oh, yeah?

Well, money talks.
For a small fee, we can discuss.

So, I was hoping
that we could grab a second,

and I could talk to you...

...about what I think we can do
for you at Highway.

Highway? What y'all need me for?

You got 20 Below holdin' y'all down.

Are you serious?

No, I'm not.

Oh. You scared me.

Oh, you're not even gonna defend
your own artist?

Not that one.

Look, everybody knows...

...that we have the hottest roster
in the industry.

We... just have one bad apple.

Look, you want a drink?

You guys want a drink?

Let's all have a drink.

I have all of your mixtapes and albums.

I absolutely love them.

Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

Well, my niece has all of yours.

Her mother won't let her watch
that last video, though.

Too much ass shaking, huh?

So, Rachel, were you from, ma?

I think what really gets me about you...

...is that your lyrics are so cinematic.

It's like I can see everything
you're talkin' about in color.

Like a movie.

What's your favorite movie?

Guess.

What do I get if I get it right?

Get it right, and I'll tell you.

Everybody signed it but Cube.

He was the only one
who had a lawyer look at it.

Next thing you know,
Cube went solo.

Wow. Very impressive.

The lady does know her hip-hop.

It's my life.

So, Rachel, you want
to come by my house tomorrow?

Mm...

I'll have to say...

'The Godfather.'

Wow. Not bad.

What? Are you serious?
I got it right?

You remind me of Al Pacino's character.

Michael Corleone.

I haven't seen that in so long.

Oh, really?

I was just watching it
on the way over here in the van.

Really?

Hmm.

We should go watch it...

Like, right now.

So, what are you doing tomorrow?

You should just come by
the studio or something.

Come on.

Why are you so quiet?

Rat got your tongue?

You're too funny.

I'm not feelin' this.

I don't want to do this anymore.

You don't want to do this anymore?

Are you in love or something?

You don't want to see your man go down?

Nobody made you do this, Thalia.

You did.

How? By offering you money?

That wasn't by force.
I offered, you accepted.

It was as simple as that.

Just like I offered you jail or freedom.

Just like coming to this hotel.

You always have a choice.

Well, maybe I changed my mind.

Yeah?

That's totally up to you.

I'll take you in right now if you want.

What I thought.

I don't know. I swear,
I feel like Cart knows, and....

It just scares the shit out of me.

That's just your conscience.

You got to beat that back.

'Cause there ain't no room
for conscience in this situation.

Why don't you help me
get rid of my conscience?

I thought I just did.

Don't flatter yourself, white boy.

I'm talking about my bank account.

I'm gonna need, you know,
more security...

...in case this shit goes wrong.

I love the way you negotiate.

I will take care of you.

And you won't ever have to worry...

...about your conscience
getting in the way again.

Oh.

By the way...

...this little meeting we had here...

...doesn't change a thing.

So what do you got for me?

Here.

I just wrote down any names
I overheard them discussing.

I don't even know
who half these people are.
