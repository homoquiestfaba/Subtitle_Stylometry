A dollar for a homeless vet.
Come on, little man.

Come on, little man.
I fought the war
with your daddy.

Y'all ain't paid me
for this leg yet.
Thank you, sugar.

Jackie Chan!
Jackie Chan!

Shanghai Noon.

I take traveller’s checks.
Arigato to you too.
Thank you, sugar.

Here you go.
Thanks.

You kids!

Here.
Hold it right there!

What happened?
Step away from her.

Oh, man,
he ain't done nothing.

Those kids.
Who took your bag?
This man?

No, it was a couple of punks.
They came and they just ran off.

Four-eight, this is Romano.
Robbery and assault victim...

with facial wound
at East 42nd entrance.

Sir, I'd like you
to just stand right there.

Certainly.
Are you travelling somewhere?

I have arrived.
My travels are over
for the time being.

Where's your luggage?

I don't require luggage.
Do you have a ticket?

Train ticket?
Ticket stub?

I didn't arrive by train.

Would you remove your sunglasses
for me, please?

Oh, I'd rather not.
I'd forgotten,
but I mean, wow,

Your planet
is really bright.

I see.
East 42, we have an E.D.P.

I have to ask you
to come with us, sir.

Of course.

Freddy!

Did you see this fella
come out of a gate?

He didn't come from no gate.
Brother came from nowhere.

You know what I'm saying?

Yeah, Freddy,
I know what you're saying.

I don't wanna go outside,
because there's things
that can kill you--

Thank you.

If you breathe
all those chemicals out there,

not to mention the cosmic rays
and the West Nile virus,

and that other one--
the new airborne pigeon disease
nobody wants to talk about.

The new pigeon disease.
I've heard of that.

Another thing that's been
bothering me is the food.

The cafeteria serves
lukewarm food,
full of germs.

You really need to do something
about that, Dr. Powel I.

Heat is the only thing
that kills germs. Heat.

Point taken.
We'll look into that
right away.

In the meantime,
I want you to start taking
Your medication again.

It'll help you sleep.
And you need the sleep, Ernie.

Sleep is good.

Is our time up?

Only for today, Ernie.

Two calls:
Your wife, bring home
a bottle of wine.

Yeah.
And Dr. Chakraborty.

A transfer from Bellevue
he wants you to take a look at.

Great. Who is it this time?
Jesus Christ or Joan of Arc?

Dr. Chakraborty didn't say.

He arrived at Bellevue
a month ago,

suspicion of
hallucinogenic intoxication.

But, uh, he was found
negative for substances
of any kind.

His EKG, his blood value
are all normal.

There's no sign of concussion,
no brain tumor,

no temporal lobe, epilepsy,
no indication of organic
abnormality whatsoever.

However, after one month,

his amnesia and his delusion
have persisted.

He claims to be not human.

A visitor
from another planet.

They administered Thorazine
on this guy for three weeks...

at 300 milligrams a day,
and he was unresponsive?

How can you be unresponsive
to 300 milligrams of Thorazine?
It's impossible.

That's why
they sent him to you.

Terrific.

No I.D.,
no missing persons report
matching his description.

What's this?

He had it on him.

Well, let's hope
extraterrestrials
qualify for Medicaid.

He's here, Doctor.

Thank you, Joyce.

Medical record 2-8-7.
Calls himself Prot.

This one's as gentle
as a pussycat, Doc.

Come in.
Have a seat.

"Have a seat."
Curious expression.

Well, let me introduce
myself. I'm--

Dr. Mark Powell,
Chief of Clinical Psychiatry...

of the Manhattan
Psychiatric Institute.

Good. You know
where you are.

Well, now, uh...
Prot, is it?

"Prote."
I see, "Prote."

Well, Prot,
we're here to--
May I?

Please.

Red delicious.
You call this variety.

It's my favorite.

I'd like to begin
by asking you...

if you know
why you're here.

Of course.
You think I'm crazy.

We prefer the term "ill."
Do you think you are ill?

A little homesick, perhaps.

Really.
Where is home?

K-PAX.

K-PAX?

Capital "K," hyphen,
capitals "P-A-X."

K-PAX is a planet.

But don't worry,
I'm not going to
leap out of your chest.

I'm not worried.

It’s just that I'm only
familiar with nine planets.

Well, actually, there are ten,
but that doesn't matter.

I'm not from
Your solar system.

K-PAX is about 1 ,000
of your light-years
away from here...

in what you would call
Your constellation Lyra.

That's quite a ways.

I'm curious.
How did you get to Earth?

It's a matter of harnessing
the energy of light.

I know that sounds
crazy to you.

You beings are eons away
from discovering light travel.

You travel
at the speed of light?

Oh, no. We can travel
many times that speed.
Various multiples of "C."

Otherwise, the trip here
would have taken about
1 ,000 years now, wouldn't it?

What if, um,
I were to tell you...

that according to a man
who lived on our planet
named Einstein,

that nothing can travel
faster than the speed
of light?

I would say that you misread
Einstein, Dr. Powell.
May I call you Mark?

You see, Mark,
what Einstein actually said...

was that nothing can accelerate
to the speed of light,

because its mass
would become infinite.

Einstein said nothing about
entities already travelling
at the speed of light or faster,

at tachyon speeds.
Tachyon?

I detect a note
of skepticism, Dr. Powell.

Oh, not at all.
It's just that you--

You speak English
so well.

I'm amazed.
Well, English isn't that
difficult a language to learn.

You should try speaking--

I'm--
I'm confused.

Maybe you can explain
it to me. Uh...

how is it that
being a visitor from space,

that you-you look
so much like me...

or anyone else from Earth?

Why is a soap bubble round?

Why is a soap bubble round?

You know, for an educated
person, Mark, you repeat
things quite a bit.

Are you aware of that?

A soap bubble is round...

because it is the most
energy-efficient configuration.

Similarly, on your planet,
I look like you.

On K-PAX,
I look like a K-PAXian.

Prot,

why did you want to
come to our planet?

Well, I've been here
many times before.

But what brought me
here first? I don't know.

Pure curiosity, I guess.

I'd never been to
a Class BA-3 planet before.

Class BA-3?

Early stage of evolution.

Future uncertain.

And if I give all my possessions
to feed the poor--

Howie. Go on.
Talk to him.

Go on.

You're really from...
up there?

Indeed.

I am from K-PAX.

What--

What sort of place is it?

K-PAX is bigger
than your planet.

But we are circled
by seven purple moons.

Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit,

bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit.

Go on.

Well, K-PAX is most lovely
when K-MON and K-RIL
are in conjunction.

Those are our two suns.
What you would call
Agape and Satori.

You finish
Your homework, Abby?
Yeah.

I lost another tooth.

Oh, yeah? Let me see.
Hey! Maybe the tooth fairy
will come tonight, huh?

There's no such thing
as the tooth fairy, Dad.

There’s just you and Mom.

I fed them already.
I couldn't wait.
How was your day?

Oh, 6:15 was late.
Didn't leave the station
til 6.:30.

Should have caught
the nearest beam of light.

You should have caught what?

Oh, nothing.
How was your day?
Good.

Sent the deposit in
for the house on the cape for
the last two weeks of August.

Which works out perfectly,
'cause Abby doesn't get out
of camp till the 15th.

Sent the deposit in?

Yeah.
Come on, Rache.

That wasn't definite.
We were just talking.
I said maybe.

Maybe sometime in August
we'll clear it.

Maybe. Maybe we should start
paying you for your time.
You got a family rate?

Oh, look.
They published my letter.

I spoke with Natalie about going
into the after-school program
next year,

in case
I go back to teaching.

And this morning my head
fell off, but I was able to sew
it back on with dental floss.

Waxed, of course.
Dental floss?

Sorry.
I wasn't I listening.

Yeah, I know.
Let's just eat.

Train was late.
I'm tired.

And to top it off,
the city is dumping
patients on us.

I know.

You stink.

Have a nice day, Sal.

I've been to 64 planets
within our galaxy.

Earth is the only one
with your species, Homo sapiens,
that I've visited so far.

And when did you arrive
on Earth?

Four years and nine months ago.

So that makes you how old?

In Earth terms, 337 years old.

I aged about seven getting here,
travelling at six multiples
of "C."

But really, Marko,
it only seemed like an instant.

Marko?
Time may warp
at super light speed.

I'd say
access one psychosis NOS.

That's glib to
call him a psychotic.
That's a wastebasket diagnosis.

Oh, yeah?
He believes he travelled
here from another planet.

What's your diagnosis,
jet lag?

Well, how come he didn't
respond to the Haldol?

Haldol can make you
more psychotic.

It's rare,
but it does happen.

Look. I'm not saying
that medication can't be
a useful tool...

to help somebody like this,
but you can't--

He maybe a good subject
for the "Betazine" protocol.
The drug's on clinical trial.

You want to experiment on him
before we have a diagnosis?

Do you have some other idea?

He's not a danger to anyone.
How about getting
to know him first?

In the meantime,
we have ten new transfers
to take care of.

You know, maybe what's
wrong with him...

is that he is.
Is what?

From the planet K-PAX.

Mmm.

Your produce alone
has been worth the trip.

Could you tell me...

a bit about your boyhood
on K-PAX?

Where were you born?

You were, uh,
born, right?

K-PAXians have babies?

Oh, yes, much like on Earth,
but unlike you humans,

the reproductive process
is quite unpleasant for us.

Could you compare
the effect to something
that I might understand?

Like a toothache?
It's more like having
your nuts in a vise,

except we feel it all over.

And to make matters worse,
the sensation is associated...

with something like your nausea,
accompanied by a very bad smell.

The moment of climax is like
being kicked in the stomach,

and then falling into a pool
of mod droppings.

Mod droppings?

A mod is a being,
much like your skunk,
only far more potent.

Uh, if it's such
a terrible experience,

uh, how do you reproduce?

As carefully as possible.

What are you doing?

Well, you just reminded me
of something I want to
include in my report.

Your report.
Yes, it's our custom...

to compile descriptions
of the various places
and people we encounter...

throughout the galaxy.

Morning, Betty.
Good morning, Prot.

Morning, Navarro.
Hey, what's up, man?

Mr. Friedman.
Morning, Maria.

I'm Vanessa.
Just chill.

Morning, Bess.

Morning, Bess.

She doesn't talk to anybody.
Afraid smoke will come out of
her mouth when she talks.

Been here since
she was a little girl.
Burned her house down.

Shouldn't play with matches.
Very dangerous.

It was an electrical fire.
Why do you make up stories
like that?

Ernie has a very powerful
imagination.

Philistine!

Come on, Doris.
You gotta come out of
Your room sometime.

Look what I brought
just for you.

Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh,
pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.

Do that again,
you go up to three.

Her Royal Highness never,
ever comes out of her room.
Not even to eat.

No wonder she's here.
I'm sick and tired
of this shit.

Everyday, coming up here
and shooting food at me.
I hate this.

The service here
is atrocious!

Good morning, Mrs. Archer.
Doris.

I wasn't expecting
any gentleman callers...

until this afternoon.

Excuse me.

You have a place
set for two.

Oh, yes. Um...
I'm expecting someone.

How long
have you been waiting?

Eleven years.

For some around here
might...

call that crazy,
but I prefer to call it...

romantic.

Romantic.
Like a, uh...

waltz in the moonlight,
or a...

candlelit dinner...

or a sunset.
Oh, we have those.

On K-PAX, we have two suns.

They rise together
only once every 200 years.

And that is quite a sight.

He most definitely
has a sensitivity
to white light,

but I think
it's his range that
You'll find interesting.

What am I looking at?

He can detect light
at a wavelength of up to
300 to 400 angstroms.

Ultraviolet.

Of course,
Prot's explanation is that...

due to his planet's
peculiar quality of light
caused by its two suns,

K-PAXians are used to
light conditions much like
our twilight most of the time.

W-Wait a minute.
Chuck, I didn't think...

human beings could see
ultraviolet light.

We can't.

Good morning, Joyce.

That's a lovely configuration
You're wearing today.
Thank you.

Macy's.
Come in.

This is so much better.

It's a lot like home.

Well, uh, Prot,

I was hoping you'd tell me
more about home.

Well, what would you
like to know?

Well, uh, do you, um,

do you have a family
on K-PAX?

It doesn't work on K-PAX
the same way it works
here, Mark.

On K-PAX, we don't
have families in the way
that you think of them.

In fact, a family would be
a non sequitur on our planet,
as it would on most others.

In other words, um,

You, uh, you never knew
Your parents.

On K-PAX, children are not
raised by their biological
parents, Mark, but by everyone.

They circulate among us,
learning from one
and then another.

Do you have a child?
No.

Do you have a wife waiting
back for you on K-PAX?

Mark. Mark. Mark.

You are not really listening
to what I'm saying to you,
are you?

We do not have marriage
on K-PAX.

There are no wives.
There are no husbands.

There are no families.

I see. So, um,

what about...
societal structure?

Government.
No, there's
no need for one.

You have no laws?
No laws. No lawyers.

How do you know
right from wrong?

Every being
in the universe knows
right from wrong, Mark.

But what if--

if someone did do
something wrong--

committed murder or rape--

how would you punish them?

Let me tell you
something, Mark.

You humans, most of you,

subscribe to this policy
of "an eye for an eye,

a life for a life,"
which is known
throughout the universe...

for its stupidity.

Even your Buddha and your Christ
had quite a different vision,

but nobody's paid much attention
to them, not even the Buddhists
or the Christians.

You humans,

sometimes it's hard to imagine
how you've made it this far.

Josh, be careful.

Okay, kids. Let's go.
The hot dogs are ready.

Hey. Where were you
just now?

Come on.
Okay.

Hey, kids, come on.
Wash up.

Okay!

Josh. Now come on,
quit teasing the dog.

Josh, let's go.
Settle down now.

Here we are.
Oh, park that right here.

Boy,
that looks terrific.
That looks great.

Steve, how was, uh,
how was your trip
up from Princeton?

Steve, how was, uh,
how was your trip
up from Princeton?

Not too bad.
We even stopped by
to see Michael.

Oh, that was
nice of you, Sis.

Quite a detour
for you guys.

Well, it was his birthday.

I know it was his birthday.

I sent him a card
and a nice, uh,

a nice, big check
as usual.

It wouldn't kill you
to pick up the phone
every once in a while...

and talk to your own son.

Thank you, Abby.
You wanna pass
the potato salad, please?

There you go.

By the way, I put him
through Dartmouth. He knows
how to pick up a phone too.

I'm thinking of inviting him
for Christmas.
Oh, great.

He spends Christmas
with his mother.

He won't come here.
How do you know? When was
the last time you asked him?

Am I on the couch here,
or what?

You want a beer?
Please and thank you.

You want some more?
Can I have corn, darling?

Steve, I, uh,

I have a rather unusual
favor to ask you.

What can I do you for,
Dr. "P"?
Well, I have a patient.

Sit down. I have
this patient, who, uh,

seems to know quite
a bit about your field.

A patient
who's an astronomer?

So, tell me about
this patient of yours.

Well, he, uh, he claims
to come from a planet
he calls K-PAX.

What kind of name
is that?
K-PAX?

He says it's a thousand
light-years away, near
the constellation Lyra.

Uh-huh. Bighead?
Green? About this high?

Yeah, I think
I know the guy.

No, he's, uh,
he's very convincing.

I mean, of course,
he's, uh, he's human.

It’s just that he's, um,

well, he's-he's the most
convincing delusional
I've ever come across.

If I can prove to him
that this K-PAX is just
a figment of his imagination,

then maybe I can find out
who he really is.

Well, sure.
I can give you...

a whole list of questions
to ask your fella.
Wonderful.

All his books and papers
and everything...

are spread all over the desk
like always, but he's
just sitting there.

Someone change
his medication?

I gave him his usual,
Anafronil, 250 milligrams.

Hmm. Well, something's
wrong with him.

An obsessive-compulsive
doesn't just sit there
looking out the window.

Howie?

Good morning,
Dr. Powell.

Good morning.
But are you looking
for something?

Bluebird.

The bluebird?

The bluebird of happiness.

Prot told me to find
the bluebird of happiness.

Prot told you.

It's a task.

The first of three.

I don't know what
the other two are yet.

He'll tell me.

If I complete all three,

I'll be cured.

There.
Maintain your breathing.

That's it.
Now you see?

There are none of
these ammonia particles
that you're so worried about.

In the first place,
I would be able to see them.
Good morning, Sal.

And I don't.
Good morning, Dr. Stinky.

Ringed monkey, 7:00.

Take a bath.
Take a bath.

Ernie, could you excuse us
for a moment, please?
Mm-hmm.

Good to, uh,
see you outside, Ernie.

Thank you.
Oh, Ernie, you stink.

Prot, it's one thing
to take an interest
in your fellow patients.

It's quite another
to make them think
that you can cure them.

You seem overly upset,
Mark.

To borrow a phrase from Navarro,
You need to chill.

For your information,
all beings have the capacity
to cure themselves, Mark.

This is something
we've known on K-PAX
for millions of years.

Listen to me.
On this planet,
I'm a doctor, you're a patient.

Doctor. Patient.
Curious human distinction.

It's not your job
to cure Howie.

Or Ernie or Maria
or anyone else.
It's mine.

Then why haven't
You cured them yet?

Oh, by the way,
here are the answers
to the questions you asked me.

I hope they meet
Your satisfaction.

I don't know what to say, Mark.

I mean, this is--
this is pretty wild stuff.

Gibberish, huh?
Well, not exactly.

I mean, see,

Your patient indicates
his planet, K-PAX,

orbiting an eclipsing
binary star system--
Agape and Satori.

Yeah.
Near the Constellation Lyra.

He could have
looked that up, right?

That's the funny thing, Mark.
Not really.

I mean, except for my boss,
Duncan Flynn,

one of the foremost
astrophysicists in the world...

and maybe two or three
of his colleagues,

nobody knows much about
the possibility of planets
in this star system yet.

It hasn't even been reported
in any journals.

Tell me, honestly,

did Duncan put you
up to this?

You know--
You know, like a joke?

No. It's no joke, Steve.

Uh, tell me,

do you know of any missing
astrophysicists?

Can't say I do.

But there's one or two
around here who'd sure like
to meet this fella of yours.

Thanks a lot, Steve.
I sure appreciate it.

But unlike you humans,
the reproductive process...

is an unpleasant one for us.
Start again.

What way is it unpleasant?

It's a pain--

Good. Not too fast.
Okay.

So, this is
Your neighbourhood, huh?

Hello, gentlemen.
Sure appreciate you
meeting with us.

Thank you, Dr. Powell.
We'd like to get to the bottom
of this just as much as you.

Thank you, Doctor.
Great. Let me introduce
You to Prot.

It's a pleasure
to meet you, Prot.
I'm Dr. Becker.

This is Dr. Flynn.

Drs. Patel and Hessler.

Doctor. Doctor.
Doctor. Doctor.

How many doctors
are there on this planet?

Here, Prot.
Have a seat.

"Have a seat."
Oh, shit!

Feel at home?

We found your notes
quite interesting, Prot,

and we'd like to ask you
some questions,
if that's all right.

Be my guest.
Good.
Then I’ll jump right in.

Make sure you can swim.

Yes, well,

let's start with this idea
of light travel, shall we?

What can you tell us
about that?

Absolutely nothing.

If I told you,
you'd blow yourselves up.

Or worse,
someone else.

You'd be surprised
how much energy
is in a beam of light.

Hmm. Well, then,

maybe you could show us
how this light travel works.

You mean a demonstration.

That would be... fine.

Adios. Aloha.

Well, when are you gonna--
I'm already back.

See, where I come from, Prot,
that's called "the fastest gun
in the West" routine.

Well, I don't come from
where you come from,
Dr. Becker.

Prot, you've indicated in your
notes that your planet K-PAX...

orbits around the twin stars
of Agape and Satori,
near the constellation Lyra.

Well, frankly,
we're a bit mystified...

as to how you gained knowledge
there's such a planetary system
around these stars.

Professor, where I come from,
that's common knowledge.

This was taken
from the Hubble.

We've computer enhanced it,
based on Dr. Patel's readings...

from telescopes
in Chile and Hawaii.

It's the clearest picture
we have of where you come from.

What we'd like is if you could
diagram on the light pad...

the orbital pattern
that your planet takes
through this system.

Mm-hmm.
My pleasure.

I think that's right.

Steven,
could you input that?

Already on it.

Wh-What's going on?

I take it my calculations
help explain the "protabations"
You've been seeing...

in the rotation pattern
of your binary star,

but have been unable to explain
until... this moment.

How--

How could you know this?

How could you--

Every K-PAXian knows this.

Just as every child
on Earth knows...

that your planet
revolves around your sun.

It's common knowledge.
Isn't it?

What, um,
what happened in there?

I mean, you--

He could be a savant.

There-There are savants
who have painted flawless
copies of Rembrandt,

who couldn't--
who couldn't remember
their own names.

You don't
believe him, Steve.

I don't know
what I believe, Mark,
but I know what I saw.

I moved. I moved.
It's your move.

One and two. Your move.

Bluebird.

Bluebird.

You just wait
till next game.
Bluebird.

Bluebird! Bluebird!

Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

Howie!
Bluebird! Bluebird!

Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

Howie.
Bluebird. Bluebird.
Bluebird.

Okay. Okay.
Bluebird!

Where's the bluebird?

Look, bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!

Oh, my God.

Bluebird! Bluebird!
Howie!
Howie, get back here!

Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

Do bluebirds bite, Sal?

Nah, they don't bite,
stinkhead.

Hey, Bess, it’s a bluebird.

Shit!
Disturbance on two.

It's the bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!

Bluebird! Bluebird!

Bluebird! Bluebird!

It's mass hysteria.

Betty!
Betty, what the hell
is going on here?

Come here! Come here!
Dr. Powell, come and see!

You see it?
Do you see it?

Lookit! Lookit!
Lookit!

What’s going on here,
Dr. Powell?
What on Earth is out there?

-Just a bluejay.
A bluejay?

A bluejay.

Off the chair.
Everybody, get off the chairs.

Mrs. Archer...
come out of her room.

Bluebird?

It’s a bluebird?

Come on over here.

I know who you are.

You're the bluebird.

Good night, Bess.

And how are we today?
Oh, just fine.

That's good, Maria.
My man.

Psst.

Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.

About that
light travel thing.

I was wondering if maybe
You could show me
how to do that.

I put up with
the stinkin this place
for ten years.

I wanna get out,
if you know what I mean.

I used to be the doorman
at The Plaza.

F-Fifteen years.

That's when I started
to notice it.

Notice what?
The smell.

They all stank.

I-I tried to tell 'em,
but, uh,

they put me here.

And, um, and-and--

And this-this place
smells worse than all.

Except for you.
Y-You don't smell,

so I figured maybe
You could help me.

You should smell
the york blossoms
on my planet...

in a gentle breeze.

Pretty much
like your sugarplums.

I would-- I would
like to smell that.

I would like to go there,
to-to your, um,

planet.

I'm afraid I can only take
one person back with me
when I go.

Uh, I had my weekly session
with Sal today.

He says you're
taking him to K-PAX.

In fact, I've heard
from most of the patients
on ward two,

they all tell me
that they're going to K-PAX.

I wonder if that’s a wise thing
to be promising patients
in a psychiatric facility.

No, no, no, Mark.
I made it clear to each
and every one of them,

I can only take one person
back with me when I return.

Return?
Mark,
don't get me wrong.

I mean, you've been
very hospitable.

Hospital.
Hospitable.

But my time here is almost up,
and I can't wait to get back.
Back?

To K-PAX?
Yes, of course.
Where else?

You're planning
to return to K-PAX.

You're repeating yourself
again, Mark. Yes, I have
one trip to take up north,

and then I am planning
on returning to K-PAX.

Joyce gave me these strawberries
this morning from her garden
in Hoboken.

They're delicious.
You'll have to
forgive me, but, um,

but this is
a bit confusing.

When are you planning on--
I'm departing on July 27.

Why? Why, uh,
why July 27?

Safety reasons.

You see, I can go anywhere
on Earth without fear
of bumping into someone...

travelling at super light speed,
but beings are coming and going
all the time from K-PAX.

It has to be coordinated.

You're telling me...

You're beaming back
to K-PAX on July 27.

At 5:51 a.m.,
Eastern time.

Hey, hey, hey, honey.

Mark,
You were just dreaming.

You were just dreaming.

Daddy?
Mark.

Mark, what’s going on?
Daddy's okay.

Go back to bed, honey.
Where is Daddy going?

Daddy's all right.
He has a tummy ache.
He's all right.

Daddy!
Get in bed!

And when did you arrive
on Earth?

Four years and nine months ago.
What's going on?

Shh! Listen.

And when did you arrive
on Earth?

Four years and nine months ago.

Your years.

Four years, nine months
and three days ago.

That'll be five years
to the date on July 27.
That's when he's leaving.

What?
To go back to K-PAX.

Mark, what is the matter
with you?

Rachel--
Mark, it is 2:00
in the morning.

What is-- What is
this patient doing to you?

He's telling me
that five years ago
on July 27...

something terrible
happened to him.

Some horrible trauma.
I gotta get to him
before that date.

Mom, what's happening?
Unbelievable.

Nothing. Come on.
Come on. Let's all
go back to bed.

Ah, I've got it!

Come on. Let's eat.

Is the spaceman here yet?
Shh. Don't call him that.

Spaceman. Spaceman.
No, no. No, no.

Whoo!
Everybody, come here.

Listen, everybody, look.
He's going to be here
any minute.

I want you guys to just
calm down. Be yourselves.
Act natural.

Okay. Spaceman.

Why, is he going to zap us
with his laser gun?

I mean it. I do.
Here.

Oh, Mom.

I can't believe
I agreed to this.

I tried everything else.
Rachel, look.

I want him to spend
Fourth of July with us...

to see if a normal family
environment might bring
something out of him.

Since when did we become
a normal family?

Please.
Look. They're here.

I just feel uncomfortable.
Well, don't.

Joyce's son, he's on
the high school wrestling team,

and Betty's husband's
an ex-cop.

Hey!
Hi.

Hey, Joyce.
Hey, buddy.

Glad you could make it.

Wow.
This is my husband, Dominic.

He looks like Data.
That's right,
embarrass him.

Welcome, Prot.

This is my wife Rachel.

How do you do?
Rachel.

Thank you so much
for inviting me today.

Thanks for coming.

Watch out. Watch out.
No.

Shasta, no.
Shasta, no.
Shasta!

Come here, good dog.
I know. I know.

Damn dog's
never liked anyone.
Shh.

Oh. Okay. Kids.

Girls. Girls.
Come here.

Okay.

She says she doesn't
like it when you hide
her favorite tennis shoe.

And she doesn't hear so well
in her left side, so--

so don't sneak up
on her anymore.

No way.

Let's get some lunch, okay?
Let's have lunch.

Let's go eat.

It’s good, Rachel.

Okay, you guys, come on.

Careful, careful,
Gabby.

All right. Come on.
Somebody else
want some?

There we go.

So, Prot, Mark tells me
You don't eat meat.

That's very healthy.
Speak for yourself.

Burger.
Burger.

You got it?

Yes, I want burgers,
thank you.
It's good.

Everything looks so good.
Pass me one of those hamburgers.

Come on.

Give me a push.

There's a photograph
on the piano of a young man
with all the others.

That's Michael.

That's Mark's son
from his first marriage.

How many marriages
has he had?

Just the two...
so far.

"So far?
No, I mean,

he's not out to set
a world record or anything.

But the young man
in the photograph,
he's not here today.

No, um,
he doesn't live with us.

You know,
he's away at college and--

and the truth is,
he and Mark don't
talk to each other.

I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

Probably because
I'm a locked-up lunatic,
so what harm could it do.

Maybe.

Maybe that's it.

Dr. Powell's been trying
to teach me the importance...

You beings place on
Your biological connections.
Hmm.

You think he means it?

You don't?

Do you know
what a family is?

You worry.

They don't
tell you that, you know.

You don't have a family.

No.

We don't have families
on K-PAX.

Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

I'll get you
some more lemonade.

# Hula, hula #
All right.
Incoming.

That's beautiful.
Thank you.

Fourth of July.

Thank you for inviting me
here today, Mark.

You're most welcome, Prot.

Come push me on the swing!

I'll show you
a trick.

This is called...

Go to the Table
and Have a Beer.
