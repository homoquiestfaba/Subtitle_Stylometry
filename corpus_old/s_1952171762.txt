Oh, Tabatha...

...your daddy's gonna be
awfully proud of you this evening.

Imagine. Pointing at your age.

Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, darling.

Hello, Tabatha.
Did you have a nice day today?

Well, we had
a very important day today.

Darling, you have
a most unusual daughter.

Well, what makes you say that?

Well, not many little girls can
do what she did at her age.

Well, what did she do
that was so unusual?

She pointed at that lamp.

Well, what did it do?

What?
The lamp.

Well, lamps don't do anything.

But she pointed at it.

Oh, Darrin, this has nothing
to do with witchcraft.

She simply pointed at the lamp.
I thought you'd be pleased.

I am pleased.
And very relieved.

Well, all right.

I'll go and fix dinner and you
hang on to her for a while, huh?

Okay.

Sweetheart, I apologize
for accusing you...

...of having any hocus-pocus
with that there lamp.

Sam. Sam!

What's the matter?

Honey, it must've been a delayed
reaction. The lamp... It went...

The lamp... It went on by itself.
Oh, Darrin.

Well, then how do you
explain how it went on?

Well, I can't exactly explain
it technically.

It's a big mystery to me too.

It is?
Yes.

But, as I walked out of the room...

...I flicked this switch right here
and the light went on.

Oh, is that all?

Is that all?

Well, I think that's remarkable.

Look.

Off.

On.

Now, that's what I call magic.

Well, have you recovered from
the marvels of electricity yet?

Thank you. And don't rub it in.

Anything else happen today?

No...

Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Gladys Kravitz telephoned.

She wants us to come over
and watch television.

How come?
Well, it's kind of a special occasion.

You remember
Gladys' brother, Louis?

How could I ever forget Louis Gruber,
the chicken fiddler?

Well, he isn't chicken anymore.

He's played a number of concerts.

Tonight he's making his debut
on national television.

He owes it all to you, Sam.

All he needed was a little confidence.
Well, you sure gave it to him.

Yeah, much against
your wishes as I recall.

You were pregnant at the time.

And you didn't want me
overexerting my nose?

No.

Let's just hope this
evening is not as disastrous...

...as the last time
we visited the Kravitz's.

That was a bit of a fiasco, wasn't it?

It all started with the banana cake,
as I remember.

Honey, do I really have to
wear a tie?

Yes, you have to wear a tie.
And hurry up. We'll be late.

I could be about three days
late for this thing.

We'll probably sit around all night
listening to him play the violin.

I hope he does play.

He's supposed to be very talented.
Mrs. Kravitz said so.

What do you expect Mrs. Kravitz
to say about her brother?

You should hear
what Mr. Kravitz said.

Oh, that reminds me.

I promised to take a banana cake
over for dessert.

Why?

Well, evidently Louis is a big eater.

Besides, I know you like my banana
cake better than Mrs. Kravtiz's.

Well, at least you peel the bananas.

It looks marvellous.

What recipe did you use?

Oh, it was one of
those instant mixes.

Hello, neighbours.

Hi.
Hi.

Louis will be down in a minute.

I can't wait.

Oh, please, please,
sit down. Sit down.

Louis said that if he's in the mood,
he'll play for us tonight.

Oh, that's marvellous.

And if she's in the mood,
she'll dance.

Go ahead, get your tambourine.

Abner, Louis is only here
once a year.

Like locusts.

It's only a stopover.

He's going on tour very soon.

On tour of relatives.

He goes from one to the other
with an open hand and open mouth.

He happens to be a brilliant violinist.

"A Genius of the First Magnitude."
<i>Buffalo Daily R</i>e<i>cord.</i>

Ask her if he works.
Go ahead, ask her.

He's just between engagements.

Twenty-six years
between engagements.

He should go out and get a job.

He can't get an ordinary job...

...he'd hurt his hands.

Then let him take
a job with his feet.

Maybe we should come back
some other time.

Why? It won't get any better.

Oh, good evening.

Oh, good, you brought the cake.

This is my brother, Louis Gruber.
Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.

Hello.
How do you do?

Easy.

Thank you.

Mrs. Kravitz said you were
about to go on tour.

Yes. L...

I had been giving it some thought.

I think that's wonderful.
When would it be?

One doesn't measure
these things by time.

He measures them by free meals.

Mrs. Kravitz was saying
you were only 9 years old...

...when you played in Carnegie Hall.

Please, don't mention Carnegie.
That was my last performance.

And what a performance.

Sounds interesting.

Full house, standing room.

I don't wanna talk about it.

I wouldn't talk about it either
if my knickers fell down.

Three encores he got.

Gladys, he's doing it again.

Abner!
I was telling the truth.

Gladys, let's eat.

Louis wants to eat. Let's eat.
Are you ready to eat?

Let's everybody eat. Shall we eat?

Come on, let's eat.
Louis, ready to eat?

You wanna see a great artist?

That's where he does his best work.

During his career,
Louis met very important people.

Kings, queens, dukes, dictators.

Yup. Those were the days.

It's not easy reaching
your prime when you're 9.

But what about your new tour?

Won't be the same.

There are certain things in life
that happen only once and then...

...gone forever.

Like that meat loaf.
Did you see it go?

Abner, Louis is talking.

At least he's not eating.

Louis, I'm sure you'll be
a success again.

I don't think people have
forgotten you.

How could they?
His knickers fell down.

Sam's right. A man with your talent
shouldn't have any trouble.

Talent?
What's the meaning of talent?

Who's got talent now? Who?

Well, Heifetz.

He plays with his thumbs.

Heifetz? He's brilliant.

He should play the square dance.

Well, what about Isaac Stern?

Plays a pizzicato
like I pick my teeth.

Well, then, why are
these men on top?

Politics. It's who you know.
It's knowing people.

You know how Stern got
where he is today?

He knew Heifetz.

They must've had some talent.

Talent, yes. Genius, no.

That's why they're afraid of me.
I've got genius.

"A Rising Genius
on the Concert Horizon."

<i>St. Louis H</i>e<i>rald.</i>

They're all against me.
It's common knowledge.

Well, Louis if you're as good
as you say you are, then...

You don't think I can play, do you?

Well, I didn't say that...

Say it. I'm a fraud.

You're a fraud.
Darrin, please.

It doesn't really matter.

I know I'm a genius.

"A Born Virtuoso." Arturo Toscanini.

"Born Eater." Abner Kravitz.

I am a proven artist.

Three world tours,
two gold records...

One snapshot.

Your little knickers on the floor.

Laugh, clown, laugh.

But I'll have the last laugh.

Abner! How could you do that?

You know he's so sensitive.
Sensitive?

He's scared stiff.

Since the knickers, he can't
play in front of an audience.

That's not true.

It's Heifetz and Stern
and the rest of the crowd.

They won't give him a chance.

I still think if he has
that much talent, he should...

Now, watch this.

Bravo!

I don't believe it.

He was extraordinary. Wasn't he?

No, not that.
He's gonna miss dessert.

And you thought it was
gonna be a dull evening.

Well, I don't know who gave the better
performance, Louis or Mr. Kravitz.

It's too bad he hasn't had
a chance to play.

Well, you heard what Abner said.
He's scared.

And I'm inclined to agree with him.
All he needs is a little push.

Well, if he stays with Abner,
he'll get it right out the window.

Louis could play at the
hospital benefit, Saturday.

Sam, don't...
There'll be a big crowd...

...lots of important people.
Might be good for his confidence.

Sam, you're a housewife,
not Sol Hurok.

I could call the entertainment
committee. It wouldn't be any trouble.

Sam, stay out if it, please.

Louis needs a chance.
The hospital needs money.

It's a perfect plan.

So was Custer's.

You're still at it?
You know I have to practice.

Since 5:00 this morning?

When am I gonna get
some peace and quiet?

Abner, let him alone.
He's practicing. Go for a walk.

I've been for a walk seven times
around the block already.

The neighbours think I'm...
I'm a peddler.

I cannot practice in this atmosphere.
Good.

Abner, if he stops practicing,
he'll lose his touch.

If he doesn't stop,
he'll lose his teeth.

So you want to hit someone, huh?

Well, then hit. Hit, hit, hit, hit.
The feet, the feet, watch the feet.

Gladys, think of what you're doing.

You've been protecting him
all your life.

You've treated him like a baby.
That's why he can't get a job.

A big baby!

I've tried to get jobs, dozens of them,
but they won't have me.

What about Philadelphia?

That wasn't my fault. I was sick.
Sick?

You were afraid.

He was sick. You know
he had fever, he was white.

He was yellow.
He chickened out.

He's the chicken fiddler.

I don't have to take this.

I'm leaving.
Good.

Only the room.

Louis, please.
Stay here and practice.

For how long?
Another hour.

Abner, he's got to perfect
his technique.

Keep his fingers in shape.

Why, we're having hot biscuits again?

You'll be proud of me one day.

When I'm back at Carnegie Hall and
I have the whole world at my feet.

That's better than your knickers.

Come in.

Hi, I've got great news.
I've arranged everything.

Louis, you're gonna give a concert.
A concert?

Yes, Saturday matinee,
the Hospital Benefit.

Is there an audience?
Oh, yes. It'll be a sell-out.

At least 500 people.

Five hundred people.

I know you're trying to help,
Mrs. Stephens...

...but you've gotta get Louis
out of this.

L... I can't.

The programs are printed and
the tickets are sold. Tell him that.

I did. He fainted again.

Now, Mrs. Kravitz, I know this
will be the best thing for him.

He's been ready for 26 years.

He's a big boy now.

He's going to have to
face himself some time.

What am I gonna do?

You won't have to do a thing.

Just leave him to me.
I'll get him to play.

My baby brother,
growing up so fast.

Hi, Mrs. Kravitz.

Soon he'll be going out with girls.

Oh, how soon we lose them.

What's wrong with her?

Oh, she's just worried about
Louis and the concert.

Sam, what are you getting
involved in this for?

Well, I am kind of responsible.
I got him into it.

Besides, he's a great violinist.
And he should be heard.

Poor Gladys.

Poor Gladys? Poor Abner.
Putting up with all that practicing.

Well, don't worry.

Abner won't be bothered
by that anymore.

Why?

Because Louis is gonna
do his practicing here.

Louis Gruber does not play benefits.

Why not? Everybody else does.

It's all wrong. I don't know why
I came here in the first place.

Because I made beef stroganoff.

Good. Let's eat.
Practice first.

You're going to have to play
for your supper tonight.

Tonight, yes. Tomorrow, no.

Now, Louis, what happened
with your knickers...

...at Carnegie Hall, well,
it's all over and done with.

Now, no more excuses.

The concert's tomorrow afternoon.

I can't. I can't.

Oh, but, now, Louis.
Louis, you were doing beautifully.

No, no, it's true
what they say about me.

I am afraid.
I am a coward.

I am a chicken fiddler!

Practice.

What's for dinner?
Never mind.

Start playing.

Start playing.

What must be done, must be done!

Blast!

What is this?

What kind of varnish
are you wearing?

Good, good.
I'm glad to see you're still practicing.

What got into you?

You see that?

Soup!

Gladys made it herself.

Chicken noodle
for the chicken fiddler.

Now, Mr. Kravitz,
Louis is doing just fine.

Look at him.
I should have brought a funnel.

You go and tell Mrs. Kravitz
everything's gonna be okay.

Why? Has the benefit
been cancelled?

No.

You be ready at 1:30.
We'll pick you up.

All right. Well, for the benefit
of the benefit, I hope he...

Oh, no!

He did it. He did it! He did it.

Louis, please, believe me, I'm sorry.

Mrs. Stephens, it was an accident.

It's perfectly all right.
Don't worry about it.

I won't have to play
that benefit tomorrow.

And I really wanted to.

What can we do?
Cancel the benefit.

No, no.

I have another violin in the house.

Well, I just can't play any old violin.

Good.

I think it's a pretty good one.

It's not as good
as a handmade Dimkis.

Stradivarius!

Gladys said she was bringing
him right over.

I shouldn't have let him
out of my sight.

He's only got 15 minutes.
Oh, he'll be here.

He knows they're gonna
have cake after the show.

Maybe I should call and find out...

It wasn't my fault!

I couldn't do anything!

What happened?
I couldn't stop him!

Gladys, what happened?

Louis is gone.

What?

He said he was going for a paper.

A paper? Where?

Philadelphia!

Chicken fiddler strikes again.

He took a cab to the airport.

Cab? Who paid?

Oh, I knew this would happen.

We'll get him back.

Honey, he's only got six minutes.

I guess we better call
the whole thing off.

I think we should wait a couple of
minutes. I have a feeling he'll be here.

Hey, what's going on here?

I don't know. Ask the cab.

I gotta get out of here.

Louis.

I'll get him.

Louis, come back.
That only works in the movies.

He went down in the manhole.

We've got to do something.

I know what I'd like to do.
Put the cover on it.

We'll never get him now.

Oh, yes, we will.

Ready, Louis?
I was just going for a paper.

In the sewer?

My baby! My poor baby!

That poor baby cost me 7
and a half bucks for a cab.

Come on, Louis.
No.

Come on.
No.

Here you go, Louis.
No, no.

And this one.
No, no.

No. No.

My poor baby. What's he doing?

I think he's praying.

No.

I think he's crying.

Louis, Louis!

Sam, is that you or him playing?

Oh, I just got him started.

Attaboy, Louis!

Play like you eat.

I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

Louis on a big TV show.

That's nothing.
He has so many concerts after this.

Well, Sam, he owes it all to you.

That's right, Mrs. Stephens.

That benefit gave him
the confidence.

No, no. He has the talent.
I just got him started.

<i>And now, ladi</i>e<i>s and g</i>e<i>ntl</i>e<i>m</i>e<i>n.</i>

<i>Th</i>e <i>world famous violinist,</i>
<i>Louis Grub</i>e<i>r.</i>

Oh, doesn't he look handsome?

Except for the chicken soup
on his lapel.

Oh, my stars!

The knickers routine again.

This time, coast-to-coast.

Well, Sam, when's the next benefit?
