<i>I have the honor today to introduce you</i>

<i>to Retired Captain William Miller.</i>

<i>He's been everywhere in the world
you all wanna go...</i>

<i>and a bunch of places you don't.</i>

I've asked him to come
and talk to you all today

at this important crossroad
in your careers.

I'm gonna step out
so this conversation can be frank

and to the point.

[man shouting orders in distance]

[door squeaks open]

[door closes]

About five years ago,
when I was on leave...

[takes a deep breath]

...I found myself standing in the middle
of the cereal aisle at the Publix...

with my arm around some guy's throat.

I was squeezing so hard he pissed himself.

My fiancÃ©e at the time had to climb
on my back

just so I didn't actually kill the guy.

Do you know why I was doing this?

Because he hadn't moved his cart
when I asked.

I was the best of the best,

able to shut down, control, manipulate...

all basic human instincts
towards one goal:

the completion of my mission.

But the effects of committing
extreme violence on other human beings

are biological

and physiological.

That's the price of being a warrior.

It's $400,000.

You lose nothing.

I already have the money. [sighs]

And... and Lorea?

[inhales sharply, stammers]

[grunts, groans]


Now you're turning on your own boss?


Fucking snitch. Shh!


In Mexico? Disneyland?

Where?

No, no.

He's hiding in the jungle, my brother.

He went there
because he doesn't trust banks

or any of those things anymore. [panting]

Sir, you could find him.

You just got yourself killed, fucker.

Jesus.

You said it was going down at noon,

It wasn't my bust.

It was never my bust.
[in Spanish] He changed it.

They took him?
I don't know.

They took my brother,
and you have to get him out.

Get him out?
Yes.

You're lucky he's still alive.

But he won't be alive for very long.

your idiot brother get involved

with this shit.


[in English] What if I told you I know?

I know where Lorea is.

I know where the money is.

How long have you known?

Three months.

And why wouldn't you tell me that?

Because I'm just your informant, right?

That's all I am?

If you've got something to tell me,
right now is the time to do it.


was given a promotion.

I deliver vans full of money...

to Lorea's house in the jungle.

That's where he keeps the money.

[in Spanish] His house is a safe.

[in English] And just so you know,

Lorea pays Diego and all of those men
that hired you way too much money.

They've just been watching you
chase your tail.

But now, maybe,
you can actually do something.

[somber march playing]

Your government has put a lot of time,
money, and training into all of you,

and it does not want to lose
that investment.

Over the next few weeks,

you will be bombarded with offers
to take your skill set and use them

in the private sector.

I was suckered into the same thing.

That's what I'm here to say,

that I have never had a feeling
as pure or proud

as completing a mission
with our flag on my shoulder.

Stay where you belong.

Thank you.

[man speaks indistinctly]

[door opens]
[William] Good luck.

[both chuckle]
[William grunts]

How many times have you given that speech?

It'll be 173.

[Santiago laughs] Still keeping count
of everything in your life?

Of course.

[Santiago] It's still a good speech.
Thank you.

How you been?

I'm okay. You?

Did you get my text?

Yeah.


Who else do you have?

I came to you first.

If you can get Redfly,

I'll do it.

Really?

Yeah.

Do you think he's up for it?

I just feel like we owe him.
Besides...

it's always a little harder
than you think it's gonna be, right?

Get the captain, I'm in.

So... this is three bedroom...
and one and a half baths.

Nice view out the back window here.

Gets good light.

Kitchen's right this way.

They're asking $120,000.

I think there's some flexibility there.
Yeah.

I don't think this is the one for us.
Thank you, though.

All right, thank you.

[door opens]

[door closes]

[man sighs]


I hear you're the guy to talk to.

Sorry to track you down like this.
Hey, man.

I called your office.

[Redfly] It's good to see you.
[Santiago] Good to see you.

You look great.
Ah, yeah, right.

No, you do.
It's been a while, huh?

Well, we didn't hear from you
for a couple of years.

We thought you might have gone full native
in the jungle.


Sorry.

So, how are you?
[Redfly sighs]

Uh... I'm okay.

I heard about you and Molly.

Yeah. It happens.

So, I got a job for you.

Guaranteed 17 grand
for a week of consulting.

No action unless you want it.
It's just a recce.

I'm retired.

I know. [chuckles]

What is it?

We're gonna get Gabriel Martin Lorea.

to do that for years?

Yes.
I could never find him, and I finally did.

I can't do it, man.

There's more of this shit
around now than ever.

Anthony was down hereÂ trying
to get me to go to Africa for a month,

but I... I can't... I can't do it.
[Santiago] I need you on this one.

It's less than a week of work.
I would love to.

God knows I could use the money,

but I'm supporting
two households right now.

There's potential
for significant upside on this.

Will you just take a look
at my work on it?

[sighs, clicks tongue]

Are you going to Benny's fight?
[Santiago] Yeah.

I gotta pick up Tess. I'm late.
Molly's gonna kill me.

Just ride with me, okay?
[Santiago] All right.

over here, even after the split?

Only in the garage.



Still drink?
[Santiago] Oh, yeah.

Want a beer?



The accountant, the bean counter
who gave you all the information.

I'm guessing she's hot.

[can opens]
What's that supposed to mean?

Oh, well, I just noticed, over the years,

your informants tend to be
very attractive women.

[Tom chuckles]

No, I'm not.

[clicks tongue, sighs] Why not?

situation as it is.




Wow, so grown up, man.

[Tom] Oh, I don't know about that.
[Santiago chuckles]

I made 17 grand my first year
in the service, man.

If you told me then I'd be passing that up
for a week's work...

Don't worry about her, she's 15.
She's not listening to a word we say.

Seventeen grand is just for the recce.

But if we decide to move forward,
this could be a whole lot more than that.

I've cut a deal
with the agency down there.

We keep 25% of anything we seize.

I've got estimatesÂ he's got
over $75 million in cash with him.

[Tom] Holy shit.
Yeah.

Let's say the money is there.
How do we get paid?

'Cause this shit is serious,
and it takes real planning.

And you know that.


who set up
an offshore shell security operation

that's ready to pay out a salary
and bonuses for the rest of our lives.

It'll justÂ come in
like any other paycheck.

Will you take a look at my work on it?

No, I don't want to see that
because then I can't unsee it.

This operation is... illegal, right?

This is not illegal.

My company's under contract
to an agency of a foreign government.

And besides, even if it was illegal,
most of the live fire you've done's been

against the Geneva Convention,
technically, so...

you're a better salesman than that.

This is a very different thing.

I'll be right back.

[door chimes jingle]

to go back to work?

[door chimes jingle]

Maybe. Why?

No reason.

You think your mom would still let him go?


<i>- She's </i>not the problem. [sighs]

Your dad's a good man.

You shouldn't be too hard on him.

[crowd clamoring]

<i>â™ª Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise... â™ª</i>

So,
I guess you'll just keep selling condos,

and I'll run and gun
until my knees finally blow out.

Or you could do this without me.

I could. But I don't wanna,

'cause I say we deserve better, man.

How many times did we fly around
with 20 million bucks at our feet

to pay off some cockroach somewhere,
and we never took a dime?

Hell, you've been shot four times.
Five.

You've been shot five times
for your country,

and you can't even afford a new truck.

That's the real crime.

Good to see you, Tess.
[Tess] Good to see you.

You coming back?
Yeah, I'll be back in 20.

I gotta drop her off. Is Ironhead in?

Only if you are.

Just take a look.
Fine.

I'll take a look.
Leave my truck outta this.

This isn't about my truck.

Yes, it is.
That's exactly what this is about!

<i>- â™ª Running in the shadows â™ª</i>
[brakes squeak]

<i>â™ª Damn your love, damn your lies â™ª</i>

Your mom will pick you up, okay?
Yep.

<i>â™ª Break the silence â™ª</i>


I love you.

I miss you.

<i>â™ª And if you don't love me now â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You will never love me again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can still hear you saying â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª You would never break the chain â™ª
â™ª Never break the chain â™ª</i>

[William] What'd he say?
He's taking a look at it.

He may not be up for this.

with something this complex.

And he needs this right now.

[crowd cheering]



C'mon.

Let your brother have some fun.
Support him.

since the day he was born.

[door opens]
That kid's a one-in-a-million talent,

going out there, playing the fucking clown
to a bunch of hillbillies.

[banging]
[Benny] Ah, yeah,

where are my corner men?

Holy shit, look who it is!


Oh, holy shit!


Hell of a night for you to show.

It's great to see you, man.
You as well.

[in Spanish] Hey! Every day you're uglier.

[Santiago chuckles]
Ah, you little shithead.

Good to see you.

[Santiago, in English]
Did you boys get my text?

Yeah?
[man chuckles]

Fish?

I need a pilot.
I can't do this thing without you.

I don't know, man.
I got the new baby now,

and my lady isn't into me
doing this kinda shit anymore.

What... What does that mean?

Did you read the text? This can change you
and that baby's life forever.

What happened to that bullshit
about going back to your mother's homeland

and empowering the people
to police themselves?

[chuckles softly]

Anyway, I lost my license.
I can't even fly right now.

Well, I don't need a pilot with a license.

I'm in with the army down there.
I just need a pilot I can trust.

Yeah, I don't think so.

[Santiago sighs, chuckles] Okay.
Lorea is destroying that country.

So we get to take out a very bad man,
and, oh, by the way,

there's a winning lottery ticket stuck
to the bottom of your cowboy boot.

Every guy in that gym would jump at this.

Come on, focus, guys! It's fight night.

Yeah, don't worry about that bullshit.

Sorry, Benny.

You ready for this?

Hell yeah.
[bell dings]


I didn't mean to call your shit bullshit.
[chuckles] It's all right.

I got busted.

It's not a big deal.

Actually, it's a big deal.

Coke?


Technically, it's a suspension.
I'm still under review.

Well, what about you?
What are you gonna do?

I said if Redfly's in, I'm in.

Come on, stick with me here, guys.
Oh, I'm with you, Benny.

But are you with me?

Are you in?

You know I am.

[pats back]
I go where you go.

That's what I thought. Benny stands tall.

Benny, take it easy! Nice and slow!

I took a look at your folder.
It's good work.

Thank you.

You need five guys and a pilot.

[Frankie] Yeah, Benny!
[bell dings]

Go! Get him, Benny!


The only thing missing is your entry plan.

I have a full set of bullshit passports
waiting for us.

We go through immigration
as power line consultants.

Once we're in-country,

they don't have
any facial recognition cameras yet, so...

we're ghosts.

So what's the verdict?

I'm in for the recce if you guys are.

[Santiago] You sure?
Yeah, just the recce though.

No live fire.

That's all right.
Okay.


When is it?

We leave Thursday.




All right, it's time to work.

At least a safe.

[Santiago over radio]

This looks like everything was done
about 82% right.

but these cameras aren't even aimed</i>

<i>at the weakest breach point.</i>

<i>She's prepared to record

<i>Pope, I have kids over here.
Does he have kids living in here with him?</i>

[children shouting]

'Cause that's gonna make things
a whole lot more complicated

and is not what I signed up for.

The family's not the problem.
They're the answer.



Lorea's very devout.

<i>Every Sunday morning,</i>

he sends three guards
to the 6:00 a.m. service.

When they get back,
he sends the rest of the team,

<i>along with his family, into town to mass.</i>

<i>That leaves him</i>

<i>and three guards in that house,
and that's our window.</i>

Why would he do that?

<i>about someone taking his kids.</i>

<i>And he never leaves his money.</i>

Also, I don't think he believes
anyone actually has the balls

to come out here and rob him.

It's probably 'cause it's a stupid idea.

<i>I got your girlfriend coming up right now.</i>

Holy shit.

She is beautiful, man.

I fucking knew it.

Fuck off.

[William whispers] God damn.

I got an execution

I don't know, I'm not sure.

Benny, I got two guys
on motorbikes coming your way.

<i>I'm trying to get out there to cover you.</i>

[informant, in Spanish]
Good afternoon, Mr. Lorea.

[motorbikes approaching]

[in English] A stock boy job
at Walmart's starting

to look pretty good right now, boys.

[in Spanish] It looks good to me.

Good.

[bookkeeper] Okay.
[slams]

Thank you, sir.

[indistinct chatter]

[in English]
I'm clear. They're coming back to you.


[all laugh]


I was getting onto the dÃ©jÃ  vu part, man.

[all laugh]
[dance music playing over radio]


Are their guys prepared to operate
across the border?

What's the scope of this thing?

Sunday soft hit is the way to do it.

Otherwise, you bring in an army,
you'd start a fucking war up there.

Mm-hmm. So, when do you need
to present to the agency down here?


[clicks tongue]
I'm not sure I wanna tell them.

Why?


It's full of holes.

So maybe we don't tell them...

[Benny chuckles]
...and we do this thing ourselves.

What?

[Santiago] What?
[Benny sighs]

Now, we each took 17 grand...

to help the narcotics unit map out
and plan this fuckin' thing.

I told you I wasn't even comfortable
helping them do it.

Now you want us to do it by ourselves?
Kill a bunch of fuckin' narcos?

If we hit that window, like you said,
when they're at church,

nobody but Lorea gets killed.


even know about this?

What do you mean?
Come on, man!

Don't fuck around.

Who paid our fees?

It's complicated,Â technically...

you guys were paid through an LLC.

Mm, no, not that complicated.

It's $100,000.
Where the fuck did it come from?

[men laughing]

[speaking Portuguese]


Thanks.

Great trip, boys. [sighs]

It's turning out
to be some full-on cowboy shit.

[Tom clears throat]

Whose money is it, huh?

It was my money.
Jeez.

[Frankie, in Spanish]
What were you thinking?

[in English] What?
Does that change anything?

Yeah, man.

You fucking lied to us.

No, I didn't lie to you.

I asked you guys to come down here,

do reconnaissance, and make a plan.

Now, we can execute that plan alone

and take all of the money,

or you guys can fuck off,
and I'll bring the team from down here in.

But I assure you, if I do that,
this fucker will find out about it,

and he'll be gone, and I need this guy.

You know how many fucking bad men
are out there all over the world?

Yeah, well, this is my last one.

[both chuckle]
[Santiago] And you may not believe it,

but I have been here
for the last three years of my life,

trying to make a difference,
but it's a fucking mess.

And it's all because of Lorea.

The thought of leaving everything
we've done behind for the last 17 years,

with nothing to show for it...

Fuck you, nothing to show for it.
[scoffs]

Look, if...

If we had accomplished half the things
that we've accomplished

in any other profession,
we'd be set for life.

Hey, man, that's the deal we cut.

Well, it's a shitty deal.
Yeah, well...

Because this man's a goddamn hero,

and he can't even send his kids
to college.

And Fish's the most talented pilot I know,
and he's grounded on a bullshit coke rap.

And how many times can your brother
get the shit knocked out of him for...

I didn't get the shit beat out of me.
I won that fight.

Sorry, Benny.

And how many more pep talks
can you possibly give?

I'm done, man.

Both knees are shot.

That neck operation I got last year
made the whole thing worse.

So, the question is,

do we finally get to use our skills
for our own benefit

and actually change something?

[engine revs]

So, are we doing this?

How the fuck am I supposed to know?

This guy doesn't come through
with the oneÂ key piece of intel

we needÂ to make this decision.

For all we know,

she could be setting us up
to get her brother back.

We'll know tomorrow.

She should have been recording
that whole thing today.

All right, if it does come back clean,

how would you do
the Sunday morning version?

I haven't thought about it.
Bullshit, you can't help yourself.

All right.

In the first pop, you'd have 40 minutes
to get in, get the job done,

and get out before the family
comes home from church.

That's a hard out.

We need to breach the fence,

sweep the premises,
find and subdue the guards,

scrub the hard drives
in the security room,

get rid of Lorea, find the money,
pack the money into 18 hundred-pound bags,

and then hoof it half a mile
to the nearest vehicle.

There's only two ways out:

the fence in the front,
or over the mountain we came down,

and I'm too old for that.

We need to use one of their vans.

There were two vans in the courtyard.

But if the family uses those vans
to go to church, then we got nothing.

So we need another van.

Can your girl work that out?
I can ask her.

Still got your aviation guy down here?

'Cause we would need
a heavy-lift helicopter in 32 hours

to get us over the Andes and to the ocean.

I don't know, but I'll give him a call.


Redfly's gonna be rich, boys!


Now we're talkin'.

[upbeat music playing over radio]
[indistinct chatter]

[in Spanish] Hello.

<i>Hola.</i>

<i>Â¿SeÃ±or?</i>

Thank you. Have a good day.
[vendor speaking Spanish]

[Lorea speaking Spanish on recording]

[Santiago, in English] Thank you.
That's it?


[in Spanish] Miss, two coffees, please.

[in English] My brother.
[Santiago] Yeah.

I might need you to do one more thing
for me.

Can you get an extra van...

into the compound, Sunday morning?

If I did that,
they're going to know it's me.

And everyone who works for him
ends up dead, sooner or later.

If you can get me an extra van
in there Sunday morning...

I will get you and your brother
out of the country

with new papers and money.

How much?

[chuckles softly]

Two million.

Two million?


And you'll only have a couple hours
to get my brother?

I'll find a way.

But I need that van inside those gates.


Yeah?
[informant] Yes. I'll get the van.

But if we're not gone forever
after you make your move, we are dead.

You'll be gone.

Yeah.

Thank you.


Take a look at this.


What the hell were you planning here?
Exactly this.

Every single gun,Â bullet,

and fucking toothpick here's been sourced
in-country.

The idea is to pin this
on a local rival gang.

Now, who was it
that didn't trust this lady?

'Cause not only is she going to get us
that extra van, but she got us this.

There's our man, Lorea.

And, oh!

Look at what's there behind him.

[Lorea speaking on recording]
Looks like money to me.

There's gotta be about 35 million there.
We don't know that.

Whatever it is, it's a lot.

What are you gonna do
with your share, huh?

Never spend your money
until it's in your pocket, Benjamin.

I'm gonna get that Ferrari, man.

[Frankie] How original.
What about the bird?

Well, he said if we're there
with three million bucks, he'll be there.

So we got a bird, we got a van,

we got Lorea confirmed
in the house with the money.

All right, give me... give me a minute.


[Frankie exhales]

Uh, you know, if you had pulled this shit
when we were active duty,

I would have court-martialed your ass.

Look, why don't we all
just have a dinner tonight,

get drunk, on me,
and you all can go home in the morning?

Nah, fuck that.


Somehow, I just...


...ended up against it here. You know?

I'm burning through my pension.
Molly's job doesn't cut it.

I can't sell condos
to save my fucking life.

The only thing I have
is taking care of these girls.


Yeah, I understand that.

Fuck, I missed this.

It's like they take your best 20 years,
and then spit you out.

Yeah.

about the mistakes.

[Santiago] What mistakes?
[sighs] Fuck, man.

All of 'em.

Didn't get better when you got out?
[Tom] No.

Only thing that made it feel better
is when you put a gun in my hand.

[clicks tongue]
So, I guess that's what we'll do.


[Santiago sighs]


<i>safety.</i>

There is noÂ medevac.
There is no ground support.

Any injuries we sustain,
we're walking out with.

Be mindful,
each of you has a medical kit in your bag.

Number two:

you cannot go back
to your normal life after tonight.

Make no mistake about it.
What we are about to do is criminal.

We do not have the flag on our shoulders,
and no amount of bullshit

that we tell ourselves
is gonna change that.

If we do our job right,

we will be committing one murder
and one armed robbery.

You guys need to own the fact
that you are desecrating

most of the oaths you ever took.

[Frankie sighs]
[Tom] Third:

family.

If they don't go to church,
or if they come home early,

it's an abort. Full stop.
They are not who we came for.

And lastly,

it's not too late to go home.

We had an agreement with Pope,

and we fulfilled that.

Any man here who wants to walk away now
can do so knowing they're the best of us.

But it's gotta be now.

I wanna make sure
we're not leaving that house

without taking care of Lorea.

If he's there like he's supposed to be,
we'll get him.

We leave at 0300.


[rain pouring]

[Benny over radio] <i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>these guys are so devout.</i>

Our dad used to say,

"When it's raining, it means
God didn't need us in church today."

He also said you go to heaven
for the climate and hell for the company.

<i>Actually, I think Mark Twain said that.</i>

All right, keep the radio clear,
let's stay awake here.

<i>How many is that getting in? Count it.</i>

Seven getting in the van.


Negative. We never saw him come out.

The wife and two kids are in
with a single driver.

<i>The family's left the building.</i>

<i>Repeat, family are all clear.</i>

All right, let's get ready here.

Damn, Pope, this lady is a keeper.

Punctual, smart, and brave as shit.

[in Spanish]Â Good day.
What's this?

I'm here to drop off this van,
and then my brother is taking me home.

That idiot didn't tell me.

[Benny, in English] She's in.Â She's in.


<i>Ben, you're first hit.
Call when it's secure.</i>

<i>With this rain,
the guards are gonna be inside.</i>


[Benny] <i>All clear, she's gone.</i>
<i>- </i>[Tom] <i>Copy.</i>


[soccer commentators speaking Spanish
on television]

[commentary continues]

[commentary continues]

[guard grunting]

[William grunts]


One guard secured in the kitchen.

[Tom] <i>Ben, come to the house.</i>
<i>- </i>[Benny] <i>Roger.</i>


Hold, Benny. Hold.

<i>Threat in the TV room.</i>

We're gonna go around the side.

[man groaning]


Eyes out for Lorea.

He sure as fuck heard us now.


Setting charges to the security room.

[muffled groaning]


in the leg.

They're taking him to the kitchen.
[Tom] <i>Coming down.</i>





<i>She said he never leaves.</i>

We got nothing. This guy's a ghost.

[commentary on TV continues]


[Benny, shouting] What the fuck?

And Lorea?

Nothing. A couple of bags.

[bags thud]
[William] He's gone.

With the money.

[Frankie sighs]
Your girl gave us up, Pope.

We gotta get the fuck outta here.

No, no, no, no, no, no.


What's that smell like to you?

Like a serious fuck-up.
[chuckles]

No.

Paint.


The house is the safe.

The house is the fucking safe.

Come on.

[Benny] I'll take the edge.
[Tom] Over there.

Go, come on. Come on, man. Come on!

[Benny] Holy shit!
[Frankie] Come on.

[Tom grunts]
[William] Go. Move, move.


[Tom] Oh, my God!
[Santiago] Fish, I'm up.


[laughs]
[Santiago] Holy shit!

What'd I tell you, boys?

Jesus Christ!
[Benny continues laughing]


It goes all the way up!
[William] Let's go!


We're gonna need some bags.

[Benny] I'll get another bag!
[William] Keep it coming.

What's wrong?

If the money's still here,
it means he's still here.

He's gone, man.

We got more!



Oh, we're just gettin' rich!


[panting]
[Benny and William] Eight minutes.

Millers, enough of that over there.

We gotta start getting this shit
to the van.

Yeah, we got this.

Come on, bro.
[Tom] Keep your eyes open.


I'm gonna go get the van.

Meet me there.
[William] Yes, sir.


[keys jangle]
Classic.

[Frankie grunts]

Jesus Christ.

[laughing] Help us, man!
Come on!Â Come on!

Come on. Over there.

[Santiago grunts]
Holy shit! [laughs]

[both laughing]

See if you can find something.

On it.

I tell you one thing, man,

you can tell your girls
they can stop studying

'cause Daddy's just gonna buy their way
into Harvard!

this is a fuckload of money!

Grab some of those and go.

How are we on time?

We got time for a couple more loads.

You sure?
Grab those and bring 'em down.


I got another wall over here!

[sighs] Holy shit!
Shit!

It's everywhere.


It's the whole fucking house.


The van's full, man!

It's all good. We gotta go.

What the hell are you doing?

Stop digging more out.
We got all this to deal with.

A couple more loads.


You know, in the ten years
I've been working with you, Tom,

you have never missed a hard out!

I gave us a 15-minute cushion.

It's 12 minutes to the church,
a 40-minute service, 12 minutes back.

Add 5 minutes
to load in and out of the van,

and we can subtract 7 to beat them
to the exit route.

We will be fine!

All right?
God damn it, look at all this money!

Just a couple more loads!

Fuck this!

Time's up. We gotta go.

I want one more sweep for Lorea.

All right?

And then we burn it all down.


I'll get these last one loaded down there,

and you call out when you're ready
to light it up.


[breathing heavily]


Lighting it up.
[lighter clicks]

[Lorea shouts in Spanish]

What are we shooting at in here?

Is that Lorea?

He's dead.

Good.


Shit!

[groans, inhales sharply]

Take it easy.
[Santiago] Where?


Did it go through?


[William] I'll be fine.
[Tom] It'll be okay.

[William] Get the clot kit.
[Tom] Straight through.

You'll be okay.

You'll be all right.

Just breathe.

I'm okay.

All right. Let go.

Told you this was a stupid idea.
Yeah, you sure did.

[William grunting]

Sunday school's over, boys.

They're back.

Oh, shit!

The family?
No, the first shift of guards.

You okay?
[William] I'm all right.

You gonna be able to move?

We don't got a stretcher.
Yeah.

Just help me get my kit back on.

All right, we can each take
a backpack of cash,

we go out through the back
into the jungle, and we're gone.

I'll cover the cost of the operation.
Fuck that.

No.We are bringing Ironhead home safe.

Not dragging him through the jungle.

And we're not leaving them
any of this fucking money.

Right, so we burn it all down and go.

There's about $100 million
for them waiting in the van out there.

We need to hunt and shoot quickly.

Call out your kills.
I don't want any fuckin' surprises.

Got it?
All right.

Let's do this.
[grunts]

we'll come down the front.

I'm all right.

Let's just do it.

All right.

All right.



[Tom over radio] <i>Here we go, fellas.</i>

<i>That's two down in the front hall.</i>




<i>I'm sure they dropped
a few guys out there.</i>

On the way.

[man mumbles]


[glass shatters]

<i>on that SUV the guards came in?</i>

<i>Because we're gonna need it.</i>



[Benny] <i>Coast's clear.</i>
<i>- </i>[Santiago] <i>All clear.</i>

<i>just passed me in the driveway.</i>

with the van.

What are you doing?
Come on! Let's go!

[engine starts]



Fuck!

Fuck!

Fuck!

[Tom] What?
What do you mean, what?

That was a shit job back there, man.
We don't leave messes like that!

<i>I've got the family waiting to go in.</i>


[birds calling]

[Santiago grunts]
[Frankie] Your girlfriend's here.

[in Spanish] Did you get out okay?
[informant] Yes.

We're almost there. Help me.

<i>Vamos.</i>

[in English]
Just load 'em up, and I'll weigh 'em.

[scale beeps]

[Frankie] Where's your guy?
He'll be here.

[plane engine roars]

What the fuck we gonna do with that thing?

William.

<i>- Habibi.</i>
[pilot laughs] <i>Kaifa halak?</i>

You made it.
[pilot] Count on me.

Mosquito bite?


Feels worse than it looks.
[pilot laughs]

Now how the hell are we all gonna fit
in that?

[pilot] Come when you're ready.
[man over radio] <i>Copy.</i>

[helicopter blades whirring]
[William] Feel free to count it.

I know where to find you.

VoilÃ !


We gotta get the rest on it inside!

[both speaking Spanish]

I don't know if that scale's fucked up,

but he's telling me
we got 6,000 pounds here.

That's $250 million.

We stole 250 million?

I'm definitely getting that Ferrari!

Are you sure?
Let's go!

If that scale is even close
to being right,

we're gonna have a weight issue.

What's the issue?
This helo can carry 9,000 pounds.

That's 9,000 at 2,000 feet.

If we want to get to the ocean,
we gotta fly over the fucking Andes, man.

Are we really leaving $200 million
on the fucking runway?

Okay, she'll make it. Let's go!

What's your plan for her?
We're already overweight as it is.

We promised them a ride
over the border into Peru.

And we're gonna stand by that!

Okay, we're gonna let you go now.

Thank you.


What's my name?

I... I don't know.

What about your buddy back there?
What's his name?

I don't know.

He said he couldn't tell me.

Okay, I want you to be real careful...
about what you're about to say

because the only thing
that ties us to them is you.

Now, when you finally had sex,

and you rolled over and looked him
in the eye and said,

"What's your real name?"
What did he say?

That never happened.

I can just go ask him.

He never told me where he was from.

He said that you served together...

and that you were honest.

Why'd he say that?

Because I asked him if...

if he wasn't afraid of you cheating him.

That's why.

Everything all right?

No!

[in Spanish]
Here's three million dollars.

And two tickets
with visas to Sydney, Australia.

On the way to the airport,
stop at this shipping company.

Make sure to send the boxes
to this hotel in Sydney.

You know that's a lot more
than 75 million dollars in there.

[in English] What does that mean?

It's not just Lorea's money in there.

A lot more people
are gonna come looking after you.

I can deal with that.
But do not stay in South America

because they will find you
and they will kill you.

[in Spanish]
Promise me that you won't stay here.

Yes!
Promise me!

I promise you.

[in English] How... How do I contact you?

You can't.

You did everything right.

You deserve this.

[in Spanish] Take care of yourselves.

[brother, in English] Thank you.

Go!

She's lying.

No, she's not.

There are consequences to this shit.

You know what we should have done?

That's one you wouldn't come back from.

<i>at higher altitudes.</i>

<i>I'd like to stay under 5,000 feet
till we hit the Andes.</i>

Ocean in four hours.

Roger that. Nice work.


between these two bigger peaks.

Find this valley I saw on the map.


[gentle rattling]

through the Andes.


<i>It's gotta be 11,000. Can't fly that high.</i>

<i>Head for that lower ridge.</i>

How are we doing up here, boys?

Can we make it over?

I don't know.

What the fuck is going on up here?

Go for it.

[engine whirring]

All right, baby.Â All right, baby.

Come on, now.

All right, baby.
[alert beeping]

We're redlining, man.
It's close, though.

It's too much weight.
It's too much fucking weight.

<i>We're never gonna make it.</i>

What does that mean?
It means we're losing fucking money.

You wanna leave $50 million
in the middle of the jungle?

Do you wanna get to the ocean?

All right, go do it.

I got it!

[Santiago grunts]

[Santiago grunts] All right, let me check.

[alarm beeping]
How's she feeling now?


Come on.Â Come on.


Come on.


[alarm beeping rapidly]

[engine sputters]

What the fuck are you doing, Catfish?

One of the gearboxes is blown.

What?

I don't want to go into a spin.

Okay, we might be in trouble here.



Ah, we should land. We should land now.

Crash-land here, and we all die.

I'm trying to get her back to flat.

Roger. Prepare for a hard landing!

<i>on the other side of that ridge.</i>

<i>- We passed it on the way up.</i>
[Frankie] <i>I remember it.</i>

[engine sputtering]

<i>I can't land this with that bag under us.</i>

We should lose the money,
maybe we don't die.

Lose the money, or we're all gonna die!

<i>Hit the external load release.
It's on the wall!</i>

Pull the lever, Ben!

[William groans]

It didn't work!

<i>There should be a manual override</i>

<i>on the cargo hook.</i>

Let me through!



[William] Benny!
[screams]

All right, I'm gonna try to land here.


I gotta jump!

[yells]
[William] Benny!


Bad landing.

[grunting]
[alarm blaring]


Fish! Fish!

You all right?
Yeah, I think so.Â I think so.

Yo, Benny!

Benny!
[Santiago grunts]

[Benny] I'm here!
[Santiago] Come on, we gotta move.

Come on!
[Frankie groans]

[William grunts]
Let's get our shit outta here.


[Benny] Fish!
I need oxygen. [grunts]

[clamoring in distance]
[Tom] Everybody okay?

[Santiago and William] Yeah.

[Benny] Whoa, whoa!
[William panting]

[Tom] They'reÂ into the fucking net.
What's the plan here?

over that mountain to the ocean.

Benny, cover us
from under that tree line there.

Fish, you take position up there.
[William grunts]

That's cocaine they're growing,
so they may have weapons trained on us

from those buildings right there.

We got working radios?

No, comms are dead.
[Tom] Go with hand signals.

Pope and I will get out there
and look as peaceful as we can.

We'll give you a hand signal
when we think it's secure.

Let's move.
[William] Benny.

[speaking Spanish]

[Santiago continues speaking Spanish]

[in Spanish] Please step back. Sirs!

Step back, please, that is not yours.

Who are you?

Who are you with?

We're with the army.

We are advisers.

You should call a rescue helicopter.

It's coming.
Yes.

In the meantime,
you are alone and don't have any uniforms.

[chuckles softly]

Okay, that can be resolved.

But what about the other passengers
from the accident?

We can talk about that.

But tell your people
to stop stealing our property.

These are our lands.

You fucked up, DEA.

No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down.

Sir, careful with that weapon.

We're not DEA.Â We're not DEA.
[man] We are calm.

[man] Tell your guy to put his gun down.
[Santiago] Stay calm. Stop.

[all clamoring]

[in English] Pope, what's he reaching for?
A weapon?

Pope, do you cop...

[in Spanish]
Stay right there. Don't get any closer.

[all clamoring]

[yells]
[women screaming]

[in English] Fuck! What the hell, man?

[woman screams] No!

[in Spanish] Assholes! Murderers!
[Santiago] Get out of there!

Get away from the money!
Get away from there!

[in English] Fuck!
[woman shouts in Spanish] No! [sobs]

We need horses or mules,
please, and then we will get out of here.

[in English] Benny, get these people
back up toward the village.

Fish, get this money on some mules.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

[Frankie, in Spanish] Get back!

[Santiago speaking Spanish]

Get up!

[Santiago and Frankie speaking Spanish]

[Santiago] Get up! Get up, lady!
[shouts]

[women sobbing]



[gunshot echoes]

[Santiago, in English] Go! Keep going!


[child crying]

All right, let's get these donkeys
saddled up, get the bags on 'em.

Where's Pope?

He's up there.

[baby crying]

[woman weeping]

[Tom sighs]

[bag unzips]

[Santiago, in Spanish]
That is for the mules.

That is for the families.

[wind whistling]

[pocket unzips]

That is for you.

Are we in agreement?

Good.

We're very sorry for what happened.

And we very much appreciate
your cooperation.

[bag zips]

[clicks tongue, in English] Come on.

[sheep bleat]
[rooster crows]

Sorry, kid.

[in Spanish]
Those men have paid their debt!

Let them pass.

[William, in English]
Did you pay for the damage?



A million for the families.

Which one of you shot first?

I don't know.

We need to watch ourselves here.

Yeah, we do.

What the hell does that mean?

Nothin'.

It just means we gotta watch ourselves,
that's all.

Roger that.

[thunder rumbling]

How far have we gone?

We've gone about 12 clicks.

To get to the boat,
it's another day and a half, maybe two.

Well, a fire would be righteous.

Lorea's guys will be on our tail.

Smoke from a fire will give us away.
We cold camp.

Well, we're dancing with the devil now.


We were dancing when we got on the plane
to come down here.

I would call this full intercourse.



Golden. [sighs]

Here.


We're a dyin' breed, boys.


The world's always going to need somebody
to go door-to-door to hold the line.

Cops go door-to-door and hold the line.

We were warriors.

Well,
it's hard to remember that sometimes.

Yeah, it is.

What are you talking about?

I was too quick on the trigger.
You know it, and I know it.

I killed those people.

No, you didn't.

We all did.

[thunder rumbles]

[Bob Dylan's "Masters of War" playing]

[mules braying]

We should just keep following it
all the way up.

Come on.

[wind whistling]

Stop pushing on me, man.
It's steep here.

Obviously, man,
we're on the side of a fucking mountain!

Just shut up and concentrate!
Jesus Christ!

Come on, just go.
Fuck you.

[mule brays]
[William] Oh, really?

Keep going!

[Tom] Stop.
[Benny] You wanna do this?

[mule brays]

Whoa! Whoa!Â Whoa!



Oh, fuck!

[rocks rumbling]

[Benny laughs]
What the fuck are you laughing at?

That was a living animal, man.

It could have been any one of us.
You're worried about the fucking donkey?

You need to get your shit straight here,
man.

What? Me?
[Santiago] Yeah, you.


You're the reason we're in this mess.
Oh, how the fuck is that?

Yeah, you had to grab every dollar
you could get your hands on, didn't you?

You could have gotten Lorea
two monthsÂ ago! We didn't need to be here.


Fucking bullshit!

We're all on the hook, are we not?

Stop it!

Yes. It's fine.
Relax. Relax.

We're not picking at the fucking scab
right now, okay?

One foot in front of the other.

All right? Come on.

Let's go. Jesus fucking Christ.

[both panting]




Are you sure you want me
to get rid of the mules?

We're not getting the mules through.

Yeah, it's on us now!

[Frankie shouts] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

[mules bray]
[Frankie shouts]


Well, if we can get over this,

it should be all downhill
to the ocean from here.

[men grunting]


[both pant]


Nice work.
You, too.

Look, I talked a lot of shit back there.

I didn't mean that.

Don't worry about it.
No, no, it's...

This is on me.

It's... all on me.
No, man, it's...

I'm on the hook for this.

You know? It is what it is. [sniffles]

Yeah, it is what it is.

I <i>am </i>a bit of a dick, though.
[chuckles]


You could freeze an Eskimo's asshole
out here.

I demand a fire.


[sighs, sniffles]

[bag unzips]

[lighter clicks]

Fuck you.

This is my "fuck you" money.

Dude, what the fuck are you doing?


to carry this money,

so we might as well be warm. [sniffles]

[lighter clicks]

Oh, Jesus.


[all laughing]


[Frankie] That's more like it.
[Santiago] <i>Este loco...</i>

Oh! Oh, my God! Holy shit.
[all laugh]


[all laughing]

[Benny sighs]
[grunts]

[all panting]

[Benny grunts]

[Benny grunts]


[Tom] Oh, shit! Shit.
[William] Ah, Fuck.



[William] Benny, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Just grazed my shoulder.

Shooter's up on the ridge line.

Oh, he likes me so much.
I'll stay here, hold his fire.

You guys go around the side.

Pope, can you step out?

Work up the trailhead.

All right.

Flank right, make sure no one else
is coming up below.

I'll cut up behind you.

Benny, you all right?

down here until you get into position.

[gunfire continues]


I think Pope's in position right now.

Yeah, let's move.





[rubble falls]

[gunshot echoes]
[grunts]


Tom!

Tom. Come on... Come on.


Come on, man. Come on...



Let's get him wrapped up.

We need to keep moving.

What the fuck are you talking about?
[sighs]

You're a heartless son of a bitch!

It was your little fire
that got him fucking killed!




[both grunting]

Stop this shit.Â Stop this shit.

[Benny shouting]
[Santiago] Fucking stop this!

Stop this shit! Stop it!

Stop this shit!
[William] Fuck you, Benny! Fuck you!

It wasn't the fire that gave us away.

That kid was from the village.

He's been tracking us for days.

He obviously wanted a clear shot at Tom.

He wanted him.

But we do have to get
the fuck out of here,

and we are taking
all of that money with us.

Tom's family deserves it!

And so do we.

All right, let's wrap him up.
We carry him down.

Rest in peace, brother.

You rest in peace. [sniffles]

<i>â™ª It's the best that he can be â™ª</i>

[all panting]

to meet the guy with the boat?

Five days.

Jesus. You think he's still there?

I can't see shit.


We need to get one of us down there.

Think one of you can make it
there and back?

I'll go.

Your Spanish sucks, Benny.

I got it.


Three?

Yeah.

You're looking for the <i>Hijo PrÃ³digo.</i>

Benny, watch your six.

You watch yours.

[bird calling]

I'm gonna say something.
Are you listening?

Yeah.

We gotta get back on our game.

Enough of this. It stops now.
You understand?

Copy that.


How many people
do you think you've killed?



As many as I had to.

Why would you ever wanna know that?

Forty-three.
Jesus!

Confirmed.

You keep count of everything, huh?

Yep.

How's your sleep?

I guess better than it should be.

[breathes heavily]


You all right?


I gave him half the money.

I hope he waits.

I didn't go into town,

but it looks like
whoever's in charge there...

has a... kindergarten army
that's looking for us.

[William] How many of them?
Two or three pros,

20 heavily-armed teenagers.

What about the next town over?

It's over 100 miles to the south.

I'm sure they've got
every town covered anyway.

Must be what's left of Lorea's guys.

So we go through 'em.


Through them?

What, do you mean we mow them all down?

What's the alternative here?


I'm not prepared
to wipe out every teenager in that town

just to get through with this cargo.


What about that cargo?

Will you do it for him?

Tom died for this money,

and we're not leaving this country
without it!

He didn't die <i>for </i>that money,
he died <i>because </i>of it!


Can't we carry itÂ out through the dark?

There's no way.

Let me talk to him.


Look, Benny's telling us these are kids,
man.

I can't believe...
I can't believe I let this happen.

Look, we all came here
of our own free will.

Yeah, but...

I thought we could...
I thought we could do this.


Yeah.

And we got what we deserved.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, me, too.

But we can't do this.
I know.

I know.

We can't just... go through 'em.

I don't know what I was saying.

It's all right.

We've just gotta get Tom home.

That's all that matters.

How are we gonna do that?


We fill our days packs
with whatever we can...

Whatever we can carry, and that's it.

What do we do with the rest of it?

[Santiago sighs]

Fuck.




That'll work.

Snow will be coming in soon.

Nobody'll ever see it again.

Good.

All right, let's keep going.

[Santiago, softly]
Let's put him down for a second.

[all grunt]


Benny, you should go.
The sun's coming up.

We'll meet you down at the cove in 30.

[Benny] All right. Be careful.
[William] Always.

[Frankie grunts]

[William grunts]

[indistinct chatter]

[dogs barking]

[dance music playing on stereo]
[teens laughing]

[woman exclaims]
[bottle smashes]

[indistinct radio chatter]

[Benny, in Spanish]
Thank you for waiting.


[William sighs]

[William, in English] No, wait. Whoa.

Is there anyone?

It looks abandoned.
Cover me.


[in English] Stop!
Put your hands up!

[Santiago, in Spanish] Wait! Wait!


Listen!

Little brother, be careful with that gun.
Don't point it at me.

[in English] I speak English! [grunts]
What's in the bag? What is that?


He's dead.
I call boss.

[in Spanish] No, don't do that.
[in English] Stop!

[Santiago, in Spanish]
We don't have any problem with you.

[in English] Right, guys?

We don't have a problem with him.
No problem.

I'm taking a shot.
No! No. Don't do that.

[in Spanish] It's okay.

[inhales sharply] Uh-uh.



[man speaks Spanish over radio]

Dumbass!

[Santiago] Where are the keys?
I don't know.

They just left me here with just the car
and the radio. [sniffles]

[in English] Fuck!

[Santiago, in Spanish] Are you sure?
Yes.


[in English]
Hey, hey, kid, just relax, all right?

[man over radio, in Spanish]
<i>Sixteen? Sixteen, is that you?</i>

<i>We're going to send someone.</i>

[engine starts and revs]

[in English] Yes! Fuck yes!

Let's move. Let's get it outta here.

[Santiago] Grab his radio.
[William] Got it.

[Santiago, in Spanish]
Here's a little advice:

[Frankie grunts]

Get away from these men.

[Frankie, in English] Let's move!

[in Spanish] Go home. Get out of here.


[Santiago sighs]

[in English]
Did you give that fucking kid money?

We should have killed that kid
as soon as he saw our faces.

We are not killing any more people.

I'll tell you right now, if we get
to that beach and Ben isn't there,

I'm fucking killing people.

All right, he'll be there. Fuck!
[car approaching]

[tires screech]

Shit.


[teens screaming]

Come on!Â Come on!
Can we go?

[engine revs]

[teens speaking Spanish]

What the hell is this?

Shit!

[teen on radio in Spanish] <i>They crashed</i>
<i>into us! Look out, be careful!</i>

<i>- They're heading to the beach.</i>
[man on radio] <i>They just passed.</i>

<i>- Everybody head towards the palm trees.</i>
[in English] What did he say?

[Frankie] More are coming.
There's two vehicles!

All right, it should open up
onto the beach any minute.

Pope, shoot!

Fuck!

Shoot the driver! What is wrong with you?

[man, in Spanish] <i>Give some room!</i>

[in English] Left!
[man, in Spanish] <i>They're firing!</i>

<i>Stay behind!</i>


[in English] They're right on us!

Where are they?

Left! Left!

[teens shouting in Spanish]

Left!

[passengers scream]


All right, here's the beach.

Where is he? Do you see him?

No, but the cove where we're supposed
to meet him's about a mile up this beach.

[motor revs]


Pope, kill them!

Just kill them!

[tire blows]

There it is!

Do I wave him in?
[William] Hell yeah!

Go!

It looks like this is the end of the road.


We gotta cross over the dune!
Cross over the dune!

Let's go!



[Santiago groans]

[indistinct shouting]


[peaceful instrumental music playing]

<i>and our administrative fee,</i>

that leaves $5,334,120...

cut five ways.

Which gives you five shares of $1,066,824.

Oh, and I need all of your signatures
on the fifth contract here.

It'll deposit the deceased's share
into the Redfly Family Trust.

Here you are.

I'd like you to please include my share
into the family trust.

[door opens, closes]

Me, too.

Thank you.

[door closes]

[door opens, closes]

all the payments to the family trust.

Of course.

Thank you. That's for you.
Thank you. I'll be in touch.

[indistinct chatter]

So, what are you guys gonna do now?

I gotta get home. [chuckles]

Not without these.

That'll help. [chuckles]

[in Spanish] See you.

Take care of yourself.

[in English] See you, buddy.

Love you, man.

[clicks tongue] I love you, too.

I'll see you in a bit, all right?
[Benny] See you.

So, what you gonna do now?


Maybe I'll, uh...

I'll go see this girl I know in Australia.

Yeah, you should.
I hear she recently came into some money.

I guess she made out
a whole hell of a lot better

than any of us did.

That seems about right.

When you see Molly and the girls...

remind them who he was.

Yeah, I will.

Take care of yourself, all right?

You, too.

do something good with it one day.
