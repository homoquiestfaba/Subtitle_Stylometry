You leaving?

Nothing.

Um, Mr. Sneider?

Good night, Simon.

<i>Good. Thank you very much,
Mr. Pensara.</i>

You have
macular degeneration.

<i>The part of your eye
that processes light</i>

<i>is diseased.</i>

Can you fix it?

I'm sure
you're going to want

to talk this over

<i>I'm gonna prescribe you</i>

these drops.

You take them
two times a day,

once when you get up

you go to bed at night.

<i>They've been effective</i>

How long do I have?

A few months.

<i>Oh, it's very progressed,

<i>I'm sorry,

Good morning,
Tommaso.

<i>Buenos dias,

Hello, Mr. Pensara.

I'm sorry

I'll be late

Well, you didn't have
an appointment.

Am I really going blind?

What do you do,
Mr. Pensara?

I'm a painter.

What do you paint?

People, mostly.

Well, did you talk
to your family?

I don't have one.

Do you have friends?

Of course.

Do I look like
a pariah?

I think you're gonna need
to talk to them

<i>(Tommaso)

Yes.

dear Isabel,

I would like to have
the pleasure of your company

for a performance
of Beethoven's string quartets.

If you would like to join me,

please let me know
at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely Yours,
Tommaso Pensara.

If business doesn't pick up,
we're cooked.

The guy who invented
the digital camera,

the number one reason

to repeal
the assault weapon ban.

Yeah.

Mr. Sneider.

You like that, eh?


Hey, Simon,
you finish your prints?

Yeah, and?

Yeah, well,
at least you got a hobby.

And hobbies are good.

They keep you
from going crazy

like me.


You're a funny kid,
Simon.

You don't say much,
do you?

[door closes]

Come on, Simon,
let's play.

You lost some weight.

For real?

Mm-hmm.

You got to eat,

or you're gonna
disappear

like Houdini.

[makes gobbledygook noises]


You're crazy, mom.

Oh.

Ma, ma.

Oh, come on.
It's terrible.

It's like
a third eye.

Who is she?

Let me get those.

No, I want to know
who she is.

Are you stalking her?


Well, that's perverted.

Why do you want
to take pictures

of girls
you don't know?

Instead of taking pictures
of women,

why don't you try
talking to one?

[door slams]

Since feeling is first,

who pays any attention
to the syntax of things

will never wholly kiss you.

Kisses are a better fate

<i>than wisdom.</i>

<i>The best gesture of my brain</i>

<i>is less than
your eyelids' flutter.</i>

<i>Hm.</i>

<i>Life is not a paragraph,</i>

<i>And death, I think,</i>

Is no parentheses.

So, what do we make of this?

Becca.

I love it when he says,

"the best gesture of my brain

is less than
your eyelids' flutter."

<i>Why?
He's kind of saying</i>

We can miss out on life

if we intellectualize stuff
too much.

Exactly, exactly.

He also goes on to say,

"kisses are a better fate
than wisdom."

Right on.


Okay, how about
the last line at the end,

"and death, I think,
is no parentheses."

<i>Well, what is a parentheses?</i>

Sort of like a time-out.

Okay, so what Cummings
is saying here

is that he's using
the parentheses as a metaphor

to say that death actually
is not a time-out,

that it's--
it's the end, final.

These were delivered

Hi.
Hi.

Simon.

Simon, could you come out

<i>(Mr. Sneider)
Come here, Simon.</i>

This woman--

I'm sorry.
I didn't get the name.

Rose Phippps.

Miss Phippps.

Miss Phippps says
she got these photos.

<i>She received them
yesterday.</i>

<i>You know anything
about them?</i>

No.

<i>We get a lot of orders here,
Miss Phippps.</i>

<i>I can't remember
every one of them.</i>

<i>Can you look it up?</i>

<i>Uh, no, not without
the order number.</i>

I'm sorry.

Who would do this?

Well, forgive
my forwardness,

<i>Miss Phippps,
but you are</i>

<i>an extremely attractive
woman.</i>

<i>Look, they were
obviously developed here.</i>

<i>Are you sure
you don't remember anything?</i>

No, I...

No, nothing's coming.

Melanie?

<i>Do you?</i>

Well, maybe
it's your boyfriend.

<i>(Rose)
He's not my boyfriend.</i>

How can he take the picture
if he's in it?

Excuse me.

[cash register buzzing]

Miss Phippps,

Can I talk to you
for a moment?

Listen, Miss Phippps,

I really don't want
to have a problem over this.

<i>Isn't there some way that
we can resolve this situation</i>

<i>so that everybody
goes home happy?</i>

That's not necessary.


Simon, would you
come with me, please?

I don't know what game
you think you're playing, son,

but it stops right now.

I got enough problems
with my business already.

Hey.

I don't want
to make trouble for you,

But I want to know
who took these photos.

It was a cold day.

You took them?

You followed me?

<i>Wait.</i>

Why?

I liked the scarf.

[classical music playing]

¶ ¶

No, no, not really,

because he could hear
the music in his head,

the rich, beautiful
melodies,

each instrument,

the other strings, the wind,
the percussion.

It's--it's like
they were playing it

right in front
of him.

No, what is sad is not
a composer going deaf, no.

What is sad is
a painter going blind.

You know, before today,

I had never been inside
Lincoln Center.

Never?

Paul and I
always listened to music,

But we didn't
go out much.

Paul didn't want
to spend the money,

and with our girls,
it was always,

you know,
save, save, save.

I never had children
so everything I saved

was for me.

Oh.

Have you
ever been married?

No.

Tommas, you're
a very cultured man.

Why do you work
in a mail room?

Where should I work?

I don't know.

It just seems
like an odd job

for somebody like you.

Well, I've been

with the agency
for 15 years.

I make enough money.

I report to no one.

People leave me alone.

What else do I need?

<i>Do you see what's happening?</i>

Did you know
that in his later years,

Goya became blind?

He used to touch
his subjects' faces

With one hand and--

Have you seen
those paintings?

They're grotesque.

<i>Well, Monet had cataracts
when he did the Water Lilies.</i>

We studied him during--

I'm not Monet,
Dr. Phipps.

It doesn't matter.

No, it does matter.

Do you think future students

will care about
why my work changed?

No one will study
Tommaso Pensara, believe me.

Well, many artists
are discovered

after their deaths.

Well, I'm almost there.

<i>Don't say that.</i>

Without my eyes,

my life is
completely meaningless.

It's not.

Do you know
what it's like to lose

the one thing
that gives your life meaning?

Have you any idea?

Do you know what it's like
to wake up each day

<i>with the knowledge
that your life has no meaning?</i>

I lost my son.

I lost my son
eight months ago.

He was almost two.

I'm sorry.

I was a boy
when my father died.

<i>When my parents' friends
came over,</i>

<i>they would take me aside,
and they would say,</i>

<i>"Tommaso, don't cry.
Be strong."</i>

But you know when they say
"be strong,"

They mean
"I don't want to hear about it."

It's a lot of bullshit
if you ask me.

if you'd like to come.

When is it?

Is that what you came
to talk about?

Oh, no,

I wanted to apologize
for what I said to you

I forgot

Rose, this is bullshit,
okay?

<i>I know that

have been very tough
for you, and I just wanted--

You act like it something

I just want you to stop

Do you still cry?

Of course I do.

Because I cry
every fucking night.

I know that.

How do you know?

Because I know you.

You think so?

If I don't,
nobody does, right?

You're wrong.

Another guy?

Yeah.


When'd you meet him?

Just recently.

Is it serious?

Not really.

Have you slept with him?

No.

Do you plan to?

I don't know.

Hey.

Hey.

You're home early.

Don't you got enough of me

Rose is seeing

Oh, Mark,
I'm so sorry.

I don't know

<i>She's making</i>

A big mistake.

Maybe.

What's that
supposed to mean?

It's her life.

You think
this is okay?

I don't know.

She's the one

Find what out?

You want me

No, Claire,
I don't want you

Great.

I'm really unhappy

You're bringing

but we should try and maintain

<i>You know there's
a price to pay</i>

for your--
for your idea of happiness

in this bogus,
idealized world you inhabit.

It's not bogus.

It's real.

And it's hard-earned.


So what am I supposed to do,

Just kick back and relax

<i>while Rose is out there</i>

enjoying her little escapade?

You know, I don't think
this is about Rose.

I never hear you talk
about Casey.

Fuck off, Claire.

Is that how you talk
to Rose?

What could you possibly know
about losing a child, eh?

I know more
than you think.

You don't have
any clue.

You have absolutely
no clue.

I've had
two miscarriages.

Not the same.

<i>I wanted
those babies.</i>

They were fetuses,

Fetuses, okay?

Casey was two.

Yes.

You hesitated.

Don't try to protect me.

I'm not.

<i>They didn't like you?</i>

No, they liked me very much.

I don't believe you.

<i>Mr. Pensara,</i>

I asked
if you told your friend Isabel

I guess she has some idea.

You guess?

Oh.

he had been responsible

for the death
of innocent people,

<i>That he had tortured them.</i>

How old were you?

<i>15.</i>

He had been sick
for a couple of days,

and--and as I sat there
beside him,

He pulled out a gun.


I wasn't really scared.

My father loved me
very much.

<i>(Rolando)
What did he do?</i>

He pointed the gun
inside his mouth

and shot himself.

Oh, no.

<i>I ran around the house,
the patio</i>

many, many times

and then sweating

and sweating.

You were just a boy.

<i>(Rolando)

That's--that's a hellish story.

Well, you asked me

That will help you.

About Isabel,
can I ask you a question?

Yes.

Can you imagine your life
without her?

Before or after
this happened?

I guess there's only
the present.

This is
a wide-angle lens.

Please don't break it,
Simon.

I appeal to the stars.

My heart peeled loose
in the wind.

Oh, damn it.

Excuse me, sir?

What is it?

What do you want?

Do you need help?

Leave me alone.

Excuse me, please.

Yeah, yeah?

I need to get
to the M-train to Queens.

Like, I'm going
to Booth Street.

Um, you got to take
the 1-train to Times Square.

But you got to get on
the other side.

Can you help me?

Yeah.

Yeah, come on.

It's this way.

What's your name?

Simon.

What about you?

Simon. My name
is Tommaso, Simon.

Tommas.
What is that?

Thank you.
Tommaso is an Italian name.

Italian.

What, but you got
a really thick New York accent.

I've been in New York
since a long time now.

A long time.

I'm going to see
my friend, Isabel.
