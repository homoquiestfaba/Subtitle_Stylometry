(scream, crashing)

What's happening?
I think it's hungry.

I don't know, I...

Honey! My God.

Oh no, no, no! Honey!

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(contained sobbing)

â™ª â™ª

Hurry up and shut the door,
the sun's still out.

I'm coming.
I have a bad hip.

And I have asthma.

but I'll hustle
in an emergency.

It's not an emergency.

It's over.

The baby's gone.

And the mom too.

Just the dad is left.

Dear, I'm so, so sorry.

Will you please make sure
he doesn't hurt himself?

In a minute.

I want to know
what you did wrong.

They got nervous
about the details,

and then she stopped eating.

But the baby,

it kept growing,

and we started
the rope ritual, and...

there was...

there was so much blood!

There's always blood.

Not this much.

Don't be angry with her.

We all make mistakes.

The baby is gone!

Oh, and if you think
I'm angry,

wait till the Foundation
finds out.

They'll think it's my fault!

They're gonna take me
and they'll...

Don't worry, sweetie.

Remember, the Foundation
is a family.

Let me handle this.

You put in the call
and go sit with Dad.

There. Thank you.

This is Lilith.

I'm at Marcia's.

Yes, we need
a complete cleanup crew.

Oh, it's a total cock-up.

She's just upset.

Let's get you
a nice cup of tea

and you can tell me
exactly what happened.

â™ª â™ª

Infertility is a big,
traumatic, multifaceted loss.

Today, the part
we're talking about

is the image you had

of the parent
you thought you would be.

Today's assignment
was to bring an object

that represents that image.

Something you can let go of
symbolically

that might help you let go
emotionally

just a little bit.

Okay.

I didn't have a lot of friends
in middle school.

Um, I was the weird kid
who would knit all the time.

I know you can't choose
what your kids are into...

For our sixth anniversary,

my husband got me
divorce papers.

A letter from a surrogate
we couldn't afford.

I would wrap
my stuffed animals in it

and pretend
they were my kids,

which was insane,

because I was 16 at the time.

It's $186,254.98.

We went bankrupt years ago.

Four miscarriages.

Four.

Bastard has the nerve to say

it's because
I'm working too hard.

Like that would somehow
fix my uterus,

if I just prayed
a little harder.

And every time,
Eric was so great.

I see these women
who are so oblivious

to what they have.

I see my nephew,
my sister's son, and...

I get so jealous.

I feel like...

I feel broken.

Like she let me down.

Like a failure.

I don't wanna be
this angry person anymore.

I know I'm supposed
to move on...

I have to move on.

I know. We have to move on.

At some point,

you have to accept
that the wall

that you keep
banging your head against

over and over and over again
isn't gonna break.

But I can't do it
if he's not...

if you...

If you're not ready
to move on too,

I can't.

You know? It just...
it won't work.

So... So you go, and then,
we can do this together.


This was my grandma's.


She always said
this got her pregnant.

I like that.

She also always said

she thought I would be
a great father.

You guys are all talking
about moving on

and some of you
about how hard it is.

â™ª â™ª

But you all seem to want to.

â™ª â™ª

And I don't want to give up.

â™ª â™ª

And I said, "Eight months
in a submarine or not,

you still have
to wear a condom."


God. I miss when sex was fun.

Not just apps and charts
and tracking and...

Yeah.

Does he still go down on you?

Yeah, but...

You know Eric's still pushing
for another round of IVF?

(softly scoffs)

I'm working double shifts
twice a week

to pay off the last round.

And the marks
on my stomach?

They still haven't faded.

(exasperated sigh)

My cousin just had a baby.

I know, I know; I'm sorry,
but it's a miracle.

Jesus. Cherise, I don't...
When she was 21,

she had cancer
and a hysterectomy,

and now she's got
a new baby.

She said some organization
helped her,

and maybe,
if you wanted to,

you can talk to her,
that's all.

(phone ringing)

Hello?

Hey, Susan?

This is Makayla Galiston.

Oh, hey! Cherise told me
you'd be calling.

You guys go way back, right?

Yeah. She was the cool RA
in my freshman dorm.

I bet.

She used to bring me pot
when I was going through chemo.

Which was for...
Uterine cancer.

It sucked.

Had the whole thing removed.

Been in full remission
a couple years.

And now you have a baby?

It's crazy, I know.

That can't be right.
I swear to God,

the stuff the Foundation can do
is...

(baby crying)

I've gotta go check on Frances.

Let me get you in touch with
the woman who worked with me.

She's awesome.

She'll explain everything.

A miracle worker, really.

Yeah, cool.

Thanks.
Of course. Good luck.

â™ª â™ª

Wait.
I think...

I think that's all there is.

â™ª â™ª

Do you think it's something?

I don't know.

Cherise wouldn't
have mentioned it

if she didn't think
it was something.

And... and her cousin had...

A hysterectomy,
then a baby.

No, that's not a thing.

I know. That's what I said.

Makayla, I, um...

I thought you wanted
to move on.

And I thought
this is what you wanted.

Thank you.

Hi!

Hello!
Hey! Come in, come in.

Oh, yes!

Thanks for coming.

And you must be Eric.
Yes, hi, hi.

Ola, right?

That's a unique name.

Oh, my parents were beatniks.


Would you like
something to drink?

Some water, coffee?

Um, water. Lukewarm, please.

Oh, and an egg, of course.

Right.

Oh.

This is a lovely home

and absolutely deserving
of a child.

The Gravida Foundation
is honored

that you are considering
allowing us

to help you achieve
your miracle.

Please, sit.

â™ª â™ª

Your hands, please.

â™ª â™ª

(exhales deeply)

â™ª â™ª

(chanting in foreign language)

â™ª â™ª

I'm sure you've been
promised miracles before

and you don't believe
that this is real.

But I wouldn't lie

to someone who's been through
what you've been through.

â™ª â™ª

The Gravida Foundation
helped me

when I couldn't conceive.

He's a geneticist now,

and I'm so grateful
that they taught me

how to share their gift.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(Makayla laughs)

It's your egg,

so it's your chick,
if you wish.

If not,
I'll take it for you.

Uh...

you go for it.

(nervous laughter)

â™ª â™ª

That's a little demonstration
the Foundation created

to show off what we can do.

It's not deception
or sleight of hand.

It's magic.

Powerful, old magic.

So you're a witch?
Oh no.

I just volunteered to help
after they helped me.

Yeah, of course.

â™ª â™ª

So... how... how does it work?

Well, there's a three-week
cleansing period

with a special diet
and some things you can't do.

And then, I will stay with you
for a week of rituals

to make sure
that the baby is stable

so that you get
the child that you want.

You absolutely deserve
the chance to be parents.

Let me give it to you.

(chick peeping)

That is quite an offer.

Yes. Thank you.

We'll talk about it
and we'll get back to you.

Of course! Take your time.

Thank you.
Thank you so much

for having me.

Oh... oh, and here.

Some homemade tea.

Steep it for two minutes
and then add a little whiskey.

Sounds like a party!

Here.

Take care, now.
Have a good one.

Come on, now.
Oh my God.

I know.

(kettle whistling)

â™ª â™ª

Oh, that's really good.
Want some?

Really?
Yeah, yeah.

(he sighs)

â™ª â™ª

Oh God.
What? I like it.

It's okay.

All right, fine.
That's more for me, then, mm-hm.

Oh, it's good. Mm.

â™ª â™ª

That thing with the egg?

That was nuts.
Yeah. It was a good trick.

Was it a trick, though?

Yeah. It was a good trick.

But was it really a trick?
Are you actually considering

she isn't full of shit?

I don't know, maybe...

Look, look.

My grandma tried for 20 years
to have kids.

Twenty years.

And then someone gave her
a carved-stone dick, and bam!

My dad.

Maybe...

maybe this is
our carved-stone dick.

You're drunk.

Compared to another round
of IVF...

what's the risk?

Energy? Hope?

The ability
to look at myself in the mirror

after agreeing
to work with a shaman

who looks like
Cherise's crazy aunt?

Plus, we can't afford
the days off.

If you were pregnant,
we would figure it out.

But this isn't real.

â™ª â™ª

Do you really think
this hippie lady

is a fucking wizard?

â™ª â™ª

Oh! Whoa! Excuse me,
I thought you didn't like it?

It's totally
fucking ridiculous.

I am so sorry.

I had no idea Susan was
so far down the rabbit hole.

It's okay.

It's not as bad as that
pyramid scheme lunch thing.

Um, I made $600 on that,
thank you very much.

Oh! See? Sometimes,
the scam is legit.

Well, it... well, it's
a pretty elaborate scam for,

what you'd say, free?

I know, right?

It's obviously
too good to be true.

I mean, I don't get why
Eric's obsessing about it.

But... what if this one time,
magic is real?

Do you want my actual opinion?

(Makayla sighs)

No, no, no.

Not soft enough.

Get a fluffy one.

Not wool... maybe cotton.

Fleece is nice.

Too much light.

These stay closed.

â™ª â™ª

What are these?

Fertility idols.

The red one
was my grandma's.

She said it helped her,
so I got a few more,

just in case.

Well, it didn't help you.

I can't have their magic
interfering with mine.

They need to be
out of the house completely.

Sounds good.

No cucumber, no shellfish,
no bowling, no smoking...

cigarettes or weed.

Not too much sun,
no liquor.

Red wine is okay,

but just don't go overboard.

And no sex.

But you can masturbate
if you need to

twice a week.

(he sighs)

Makayla, I'll need for you
to text me updates

on your cycle.

Now. You'll have to follow
all of these restrictions

perfectly for three weeks

before the week of the rituals.

If you don't,
the magic won't work.

â™ª â™ª

Oh! Okay.

(clears his throat)

â™ª â™ª

Oh, that's really good.

It's an old recipe,

with some herbs
to open up your chakras.

Oh. Mm.

â™ª â™ª

Mm-hm.

â™ª â™ª

Here's our contract.

It spells out
everything you need to know.

Each clause needs to be
initialed by both of you.

No problem.

Okay. Yeah.

What's this
required monitoring thing?

Um, Section 8B?

Oh, just a little visit
from the Foundation.

We'll stop by and bring you
diapers, clothes,

whatever you need.

See? Yeah. That's nice.

(pen scratching)

â™ª â™ª

If you wanna do this,
I'm in.

But if this doesn't work,
I'm done.

No IVF, no research studies
or idols or crystals

or crazy witch ladies.

No offense.

â™ª â™ª

But what if there's...
No. This is it.

â™ª â™ª

One last try.

Oh. Oh.

Well, after this,

there'll be nothing left to try.

We'll get dogs.

I want Schnauzers.

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

Here.

It's lace.

Put it in your windows.

It will help fortify
the light in your home.

Okay.

For your red wine.

Technically,
kosher is best,

but it's awful,
so it really doesn't matter.

What about sangria?

Honey, she just said red...
What? It's wine and fruit.

I can have fruit, right?

That's a good question.

You can ask
one of the representatives

through out app.

Here's the login information.

You guys have an app?
Of course!

Magic isn't stuck
in the dark ages.

The app's got all the rules

and a section for your
prayers and pronunciations,

my contact info.

But just use
the chat function.

They can help.

And, frankly,
they know the little things

better than I do.

If you need to delay
for any reason, that's fine.

But if you cheat
and don't tell me...

Anything unexpected
can be a disaster.

Hm. Okay, well, we'll behave.

You'd better.

Now. Before you begin
this journey,

take a night, get drunk,
eat junk food, get high.

Enjoy what you're sacrificing.

Understand it.

I'm so happy for you both!

â™ª â™ª

Come on, open up, open up.

Uh-uh.
Just practice, rehearsal.

We're gonna have a baby,
open up.

(he grunts)
Uh-uh... uh-uh...


I can't believe
we're doing this.

â™ª â™ª

I don't wanna go a month
without processed carbs.

â™ª â™ª

So you're in?

100 percent.

You're not gonna
accidentally eat a cookie

every two and a half weeks?

No!

Hm.

â™ª â™ª

Plus, it's easier than IVF,
and cheaper.

We could diet a little
and put lace on our windows.

And no shots.

â™ª â™ª

I think this'll be good for us.

â™ª â™ª

Maybe she can do magic.

She could be like Madam Pomfrey,

who went rogue
to help Muggles.

The next time she's here,

let's say "Voldemort."

See if she flinches.

That's good, huh?
That's good.

Fuckin' brilliant.

Dude, I think weed
makes me smarter.

Ra-dara nu...

come on.

Nu-ka ko-poer

e son.

Again.

Excuse me.

Ugh, I'm gonna be late.

â™ª â™ª

(Makayla exclaims)

You know, I'm gonna be at home
late tonight,

and she said you could jerk off
if you wanted to.

â™ª â™ª


Ra-dara nu-ka
ka-poer e son.

Ra-dara nu-ka ka poer e son.

Ra-dara nu-ka
ka poer e son.

Ra-dara nu-ka ka-poer e son.

Ra-dara nu-ka
ka-poer e son.

Ra-dara nu-ka ka poer e son.

Ra-dara nu-ka
ka poer e son

Ra-dara nu-ka ka poer e son.

(Makayla sighs)

You ready for tomorrow?

I'm ready for this to be done.

Sick of eating rabbit food.

And I miss, you know, sex.

Same...

same.

Um...

If this, um, doesn't work,

are you gonna be okay?

(insects chirring)

I think so.

I can't get any crazier
than this, right?

Hmph. Promise?

Promise.

Wonderful.
Now we can begin.

I just wanna say, we're so...
I'll be right back.

Wow.

Well, whatever happens,
it will be a hell of a story.

Seriously.

Do you, uh,
do you want some help?

Oh, no, no, no.

I've got it, sweetie.

Is this baby bondage gear?

What do you think
these lightbulbs are for?

The baby will have
sensitive eyes

from the magic.

Six months, you won't even
be able to tell at all.

Okay.

(car alarm chirps)

Let's get to it.

Where will the baby be sleeping?

Oh, uh, well, we thought
maybe with us for a bit?

It'd make the nighttime
feedings easier, and...

And then?

You have a bedroom
for your baby, right?

Yeah.
The guestroom.

Eric's old office.

We were gonna convert it
after the baby was born...

Oh no. It needs to be done now.

Preparing the space
is part of the process.

Oh. Okay.

It's all gotta go.

Can we move everything
to the garage?

Not really.

The baby's spirit
needs to know

it will have
a dedicated space of its own.

I'm sure you can
get it emptied by sunset.

Sunset... today?

I don't wanna delay.

Heh. No.

One, two, three.

There we go.

Woo! Ta-da.

Can't believe you guys
are really doing this.

It's your fault.

Thanks for the tip.

You're welcome, I guess?

But I am pulling
for you guys,

despite everything I know
about biology, physics,

science in general.

Oh my God. Is that her?

She looks like my Aunt Marge
who sold us that acid.

Maybe we can get
some good drugs off of her.

Or, uh, you know, a baby.

Either way,
it'll be a trip.

Really?
Yeah, yeah.

Eww.
Oh, come on.

(door closes)

All right,
let's get going.

â™ª â™ª

Kneel.

â™ª â™ª

I don't know
why you think I'm joking.

Kneel.

Okay.

â™ª â™ª

We hide the light
of the world away

and invite the light
between the stars

into our homes
and our hearts.

Stay.

â™ª â™ª


You think we'll get a treat
if we're good?

Ruff! Ruff, ruff.


â™ª â™ª

Done?

â™ª â™ª

What?

Take the chicken.

(soft clucking)

â™ª â™ª

Eric, you too.

â™ª â™ª

This bird,

the one hatched
at your table,

represents the child
you did not have,

the one you expected,

the one you will not have.

(gasp, bones crunch)

â™ª â™ª

I'm not hungry.

What are you worried about?

You don't believe
in any of this, remember?

Yeah. 'Cause it's weird
and it's creepy.

But you've bought into it,

so now I need to eat
a bird that died in my hands

in our living room.

Uggh.

I love you.

You're welcome.

Knock, knock!
I'm coming in!

Hey, Mama and Papa,
great to be here.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Dr. Zekeny, OB-GYN.

Yale undergrad, Harvard Med,
Duke residency.

You can call me Dr. Zekeny.

Dr. Z, Doc, Z.

It's all good.

I work at Mercy General
downtown

and I volunteer
with the Gravida Foundation

whenever I can.

My bio's in the app.

It's, uh, nice to meet you.

Likewise, likewise.

And you.

What are you doing here?

He's... helping?

Well, specifically,

Ola makes the magic happen

and I keep you safe
with modern medicine.

Pregnancy's tough,
magic or not.

Uh, if it's okay,

I'd like to get
a quick look-see,

just to make sure
everything's shipshape.

Shouldn't you have done that
three weeks ago,

before we started dieting?

Hon...

Ola would have caught anything
that would have been

incompatible with our process.

This is just for a baseline.

I'll give you a moment to

get changed and, uh,
get on the table.

(Ola chuckles)

Are you okay?

Can you get me a water?

(he clears his throat)

Hey, Eric.

How you feeling?

I'm just having some trouble.

I don't know.

This... this is magic,
and you're a doctor?

How does that work?

Well... we don't know
exactly how Tylenol works,

or penicillin,

but they do,
and so does magic.

I'm a big believer in results,

and the Gravida Foundation
made me,

and I turned out okay.

So you're a...
...Foundation baby?

Through and through.

And I'm pretty awesome.

Listen. I know this is scary,
but, uh...

it's gonna be the best decision
you ever made.

You ready?

Yeah, uh, I'll be right there.

(door closes)

(Makayla exclaims)

What's going on?

Oh... cold hands.

You okay?

Yeah.

(door closes)

(she breathes deeply)

(vague abdominal rumbling)

All right.

Before we do the draw,

any family or personal history
of anemia, sickle cell,

cancer, hemophilia?

Any blood disorders?

Nothing on my side.

My grandmother had
breast cancer.

But no history
of leukemia or myeloma,

nothing like that?

No.

Great.

The Foundation will be
very happy to hear that.

Why would they care?

I send them a full report.

It's their process,
they just make sure

I'm not missing anything.

But Makayla, look at him.

His parents, uh... well,
they used the Foundation too.

The Gravida Foundation
is a family.

Welcome.

Your veins are lovely.

Quick pinch.

(she exclaims softly)

Hold that right there.

All right.

Everything looks perfect.

You're healthy.

I'll be back to check on you
every night.

If you need anything
before then,

feel free to call me
on the app.

Oh, and, uh, you're
gonna feel pretty terrible

most of the time.

But, uh,
it's gonna be worth it.

Blink of an eye.

Wouldn't that be something.

I'll let you get changed.

Thank you, Doctor.

(door closes)

Let's begin.

â™ª â™ª

This first ritual
is the true beginning

of your journey into parenthood.

Take your place in front of me,
facing each other.

â™ª â™ª

Huh. That's modern.

Better for my asthma.

It's the ambience that matters.

Speeds things up, anyway.

The mats too.

â™ª â™ª

Blessed be the mother

who gives herself
for her child.

â™ª â™ª

Half.

â™ª â™ª

Blessed be the father

who gives himself
for his child.

â™ª â™ª

Whoa.

â™ª â™ª

Okay.

Now, please, strip nude.

â™ª â™ª

How did you think it worked?

â™ª â™ª

I guess, uh,
just pretend like

we're on that beach
from our honeymoon?

Are you gonna get sunburn
on your junk again?

Nice.

Man and woman
is all there is.

I am outside your world.

Your world is a void.

All you see is each other,

bathing in the light
of your love,

the light between the stars.

Don't think about me.

Don't think about
making a child.

This doesn't work
in our world.

It only works in the world
you create together.

The symbols I'm drawing
will bind you in that world.

So let your eyes be honest.

Look at each other.

Take it in.

â™ª â™ª

Think about everything
your partner has given you.

Every smile,
every laugh,

every flutter
of your heart.

Place your palms together,

and through your touch,

show your partner
the person they are to you.

Interlock your fingers

and become the person
you are to them.

You are connected.

You are alone
in your world.

Hold fast.

Stay together.

Don't let go.

â™ª â™ª

(chanting in foreign language)

Give yourself to her.

They await you.

Your light.

Be known to them,

O great ones!

(echoed incantation)

â™ª â™ª

Come to them!


â™ª â™ª

You did well.

I hope it worked.

But we'll know for sure
in the morning.

Get some rest.

I'll clean up.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


Holy shit!

Oh, God.

â™ª â™ª

Good morning.
Oh!

Sit, sit.

Morning.

Sleep well?
Uggh.

Well, some breakfast
should perk you up.

(liquid being poured)

Thanks.

(glasses clink)

Mm.

Um...

What?

Mm...

That's a good sign.

Come with me.

Eat it all, okay?

Okay...

(door closes)

This will be uncomfortable,

but you'll feel better.

It won't last too long,
I promise.

(Ola sings in foreign language
while Makayla retches)

(softly exclaiming)

(toilet flushes)

I think it worked.

The toilet?

I'm pregnant!

How could you possibly
know that?

Ola said that...
An egg can't implant

that quickly.

Of course it can.

I'm only here for a week,
not nine months.

â™ª â™ª

Wait, wait,
so, in a week...

She'll have a baby

and I'll be out of your hair.

(nervous laughter)

What? No, that's not, that's...

It's magic.

I've been telling you.

Why do you think
she's nauseous?

Food poisoning?

Eric.
What?

I can feel it.

A week?

How is that a bad thing?

Honey...

Oh...-uh, no, no.

â™ª â™ª

Let's get you to bed.

(toilet flushes)


She's doing great.

This is perfectly normal.

There's a lot going on
inside of her.

I don't know if I get
paternity leave at work

with no notice.

Oh, don't worry
about all that!

The Foundation can help.

Let's keep you busy.

Wow. Mancala.

It's been a while.

It's easy.
You'll remember fast.

Me again.

(beans clattering)

I just keep waiting
for you to pull out

a vacuum to sell me.

Oh, I promise you,

that's not what
the Gravida Foundation is about.

But obviously, you know,
they want something.

To bring life
into the world,

that's all.

When you went from barren
to a mother in a week,

which is insane,

what'd you tell people?

They'll just be happy for you.

â™ª â™ª

And after you had your son,

well, I mean, do a lot
of the kids that they make...

'cause they do make them...

um, do they all
become doctors?

I mean, your son is one,
and Dr. Z.

Some.

The Foundation
wants their children

to reach their full potential,

whatever they want to be.

We're a family.

And you'll be
a part of it.

The doctor said that too.

He would know.

â™ª â™ª

I'm so hungry!

(Ola chants in foreign language)

(Makayla slurps food
and makes relishing noises)

â™ª â™ª

Just ignore me.

â™ª â™ª

Like I said,

you guys are doing great.

This week's gonna be tough,

but just keep eating
what Ola feeds you.

Sure thing.

How long have you known Ola?

Oh, we go way back,

since she started
the Foundation.

Really?

Because she said

she started with them
when she had her son.

Yeah, that's true.

She said her son
just turned 40.

Did she?

She did.

Do you know what
she could have been talk...

Eric, please!
See you guys tomorrow.

(door opens, closes)

â™ª â™ª

(Makayla exclaims,
baby cries)

â™ª â™ª


Makayla?

(Makayla pants, exclaims)


Why were you screaming?

It hurts.
There's blood.

Oh, there's always blood.

Did you oil
like you were supposed to?

Uh-huh.

The baby's doing nine months
of growing in one week.

The skin can split
a little bit.


You're fine, you're fine.

It's okay, it's okay.

â™ª â™ª

I'm calling 9-1-1.

They won't have any idea
what to do with this.

Yeah, but...

Holy shit.


Come on, let's clean you up.

Are you sure we should move her?

Yes, give her a hand.

â™ª â™ª

Honey?

â™ª â™ª


Come on.

â™ª â™ª

Relax, dear, this is common.

Then why didn't you warn us?
It's okay, Eric.

This whole process
is scary enough.

It's better for the baby
if you're not all anxious

about every detail.

I'm gonna call the doctor.
Sure, if you'd like,

but he's gonna tell you
the same thing I did.

â™ª â™ª

(phone dialing)

Hello, Dr. Zekeny.
Hey, Dr. Z.

It's Eric Galleston.
Hey, Eric, how are ya?

Not very good, actually.

Makayla just woke up
with her stomach split open,

and... and then she started
licking her own blood.

It's nothing to worry about.

I know it's super scary,

but this is all part
of the process, I promise.

These are... these are
all good signs.

What about the licking?
Weird cravings.

Yeah, I had a patient once
who kept wanting to drink

window cleaner.

I'll see you tomorrow night.

â™ª â™ª

Oh, I remember what it's like.

But you knew pregnancy
would be hard.

Aren't we lucky
ours are so fast?


Oh, don't make it harder
for the baby too.

The process is working.

It's what you wanted.

â™ª â™ª

Hey, are you okay?

We got her all wrapped up
with some special bandages.

I'm wonderful.

You're gonna be a dad.

â™ª â™ª

(soft groaning)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

You two lovebirds sleep tight.

Thanks, Ola.


(door opens, closes)

â™ª â™ª

(birds chirping)

â™ª â™ª

Mmm.

How's yours?

I'm not that hungry.

Too bad.
Come on, eat, eat, eat.

Oh!

Ola...

the doctor said
he's been working with you

since you started
with the foundation.

That's right.

Which is when your son was born,

about 40 years ago?

Thirty-seven.

But Zekeny's bio online said
he graduated from med school

in 2002.

Oh, oh, that's right.

(she chuckles)

It was his father who helped me.

Mmm.

I sometimes get them
a bit confused.

Such a family resemblance.

Wouldn't it be cool if your baby
looked just like you?

I'm not naming him Eric Jr.
though.


What was his name?

Zekeny's father.

Um... Abraham, Aaron,
something biblical.

I like Abraham, or Isaac.
Zekeny also said it was him,

not his dad.
I really like classical names.

Or, ooh, how about Edith?

Makayla!
Hey, hey!

Let me talk for one second,
okay?

All right, I was just excited.
She's expecting.

Seriously?

(Eric laughs)

What is this?

Oh, no, I guess I'm in trouble.

(birds singing)

It's scary,

it's stressful,
and lots of things...

You guys are hiding something.

He's supposed to be
44 years old, that's bullshit

and you know it.
Good Lord!

It's clearly some sort
of miscommunication!

She's pregnant!

You can see that.

Breathe.

Eat.

Be happy.

(sighs, groans)



(phone ringing)


Hey, magic momma, what's up?

It worked.

I'm pregnant.
What?

How?

Magic.

Uh, well, that's... wonderful.

Crazy, too, but...

I'm so happy for you.

Thanks.

I wish Eric was as happy.

Well, if he screws this up,
I will fucking kill him.

Please don't.

You know, I was licking blood
off my hand last night.

Yeah, I think that
really freaked Eric out,

but the doctor said
it's just cravings, so...

Wait, wait, wait,
why were you bleeding?

Uh...

The skin on my stomach,

it... it ripped
when it grew so fast.

Jesus.

Well, no wonder Eric's freaked.

Yeah, but...

I know it's weird,
but I'm pregnant.

He should be happy.

Yeah, still...

Okay, um...

If it's real,
I'm sure he'll get there.

I just know it.
Thanks.

Really, for everything.

For being a good friend
and for telling us about Susan.

Well, I am a good friend,
but I will not babysit,

but I will hold your beer for
you while you change a diaper.


Wow, you're so generous.

Love you. Later.

Love you.

(phone dialing)

Cherise.
Hey, cuz.

Can I talk to you about...
Did she do it?

(baby crying)

She did, didn't she?

Yeah, Makayla, she's pregnant.

Can you come over in person
just in... case...

(baby crying)

Never mind.

Can you just come over, please?

(baby crying)

(birds chirping)


(door sliding open)

Someone's at the door,
get rid of him.

(door opens)

Hi! Sorry to bug you.

I'm Rufus
with Rufus Extermination,

and I'm here to protect
your family...

We're fine, thanks.
You might be fine,

but do you have any kids?

Not yet, my wife is...
almost due.

Congratulations!
Thanks.

Uh, my stuff's not so great
for newborns, so...

Awesome, thanks.

Eric, come in here please.

â™ª â™ª

This will be your child's
safe place in the world,

like a womb where the mother
surrounds the child.

Dad too.

Hold this.
Okay.

We'll take a bit of your blood
and mix it with the paint.

You will be all around,

watching, protecting,

part of the light.

â™ª â™ª

Okay, um...

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

What the hell are you doing?

We only need two drops.

I have a finger stick!


â™ª â™ª

That's way too much.

Why would you cut
your palm anyway?

There are far better places...
Okay, I don't know!

Okay, I don't know, I just...

You said blood, and I thought...

I'll tell you what to do,
then you do it.

Right now, do nothing.

â™ª â™ª

I'm sorry,
I was trying to be supportive.

It was very sweet.

You doin' okay?

Eh, it stings a little.

That's not what I meant.

Yeah, you know, I just...

â™ª â™ª

This is all crazy, you know?

Yeah, I know.

â™ª â™ª

This wrap will heal you
relatively quickly.

It's the same as her belly,
actually.

We match.

Don't do that again.

Next time,
wait for specific instructions.

â™ª â™ª


Now, Makayla,

we'll add your blood to Eric's.

â™ª â™ª


Get the paint can.

I got it, I got it.


Here?
Down.

â™ª â™ª

(knife scraping)

For mixing.

â™ª â™ª

(chanting in foreign language)

â™ª â™ª

Eric, it'll be your job
to paint.

â™ª â™ª

Be thorough.

Every spot.

You, with me.

â™ª â™ª


(birds chirping)

(shades clattering)

Come in.

Hey, I wanted to see
if you were okay.

Were you followed?
What's wrong, what's going on?

He's hungry.
I can't feed him anymore.

He's... he's always eating.
Have you talked to the doctor?

The doctors, they don't...

they're all part of it.

The foundation is everywhere.

You have to tell them
not to trust them.

It's not what they say.

What is it?

Makayla said her pregnancy
was only one week.

Is that true?

You have to get your friend
out of there!

Out of the house.

Just get her away.
Why?

What did they do?


They gave me... a monster.

Okay, where's Mark?


Mark?

He's got a really good job now.

He works for the foundation now,

but the baby, you see,
I feed the baby.

Could I maybe help you?

He's just hungry.

He's so hungry, and I have
been feeding him, but...

I think...

I think... I think
I'm getting sick again.

He won't drink from me.

(breathing heavily)

You could help.

â™ª â™ª

Could I have some
of your blood?

Please, I just need
a little bit,

just one bottle.

Please, he'll take him
from me if I can't!

(gently shushing)

Put it down.

It's okay.

Put it down.


You have to get her
out of there,

get her away.

Tell... tell her...

tell her I'm so sorry.

â™ª â™ª

He is just so hungry.


â™ª â™ª

(light thunk)


â™ª â™ª

Okay, um...

â™ª â™ª

Wow.


Okay.

(phone vibrating)

Hey! What's going on?

Hey, is Makayla okay?
She didn't pick up.

Uh, yeah, yeah, she's fine.

Uh, what's wrong?

I'm at Susan's and she had an...
I don't know, an episode.

The place is a mess,
and she kept going on and on

about the... what's it,
the Godiva Foundation?

Gravida Foundation.

Yeah, well, she said
she needed blood for the baby.

She... she asked me
to fill a bottle

while holding a knife.

Holy shit!

Eric?
Uh, uh, one second, one second.

Uh, go on.
Look, I called 9-1-1,

and some people showed up.

They're in the back
talking to her,

but I don't know who they are.

They're not cops or EMTs.

They're just... weird.

Cold hands, black suits.

Huh, well, I haven't seen
anyone here like that, so...

I'm just really worried
about Makayla.

I mean, she's okay.

I heard her stomach ripped

and she licked blood?

Eric, that is not normal.

No, but, uh, she's pregnant.

Cherise, it's, um...

It's real.
What is real?

Exactly what kind of baby
are you getting?

Look, I hope I'm wrong.

Just... keep an eye out, okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, okay, thanks.


Hey, Susan.

I'm so sorry.

My mom called.

I didn't have your dad's number.

It's fine.

You were right to worry.

The foundation sent out
some help.

â™ª â™ª

Why don't I stay too?

â™ª â™ª

What's going on?
Nothing.

Why did you say, "Holy shit"?

It was Cherise.

Her cousin Susan had an episode,
and, um, she wanted to warn you.

What kind of episode?
Warn me, about what?

She said not to trust
the foundation,

that Susan has been feeding
her... her baby blood,

and she pulled a knife
on Cherise.

Oh my God.
She's okay, but...

Postpartum depression can happen
in magical pregnancies too.

It... it can make things
seem insurmountable, unreal.

I'll have a pamphlet for you.

Okay, but that doesn't explain
why she's...

I'm sure someone
from the foundation

is on their way
to help her out.

They're the ones
behind all of this.

What are they behind?

Eric, what are you saying?

Whatever you and Zekeny
are lying about, huh?

I found out something
about the doctor.

He's lying about his age.
Eric, come on.

No, no, no, I want to know.

I want to know the truth
about Zekeny,

about our baby,
and about Susan.

Is she crazy
or is she telling the truth

about feeding her baby blood?

â™ª â™ª

Maybe sometimes a little, but...

Are you fucking kidding me?

Are we having
a fucking vampire baby?

That term has
a lot of implications.

Implications?

What?!

This is a person,

just like you,

with slightly unique needs.

People eat placenta,
bone, brain.

It's a monster.

All babies are monsters.

They... they scream and they cry
and they shit and they puke,

but this one's ours, so...
so what should it matter?

Susan tried to stab Cherise.

Cherise, your best friend.

That has nothing to do
with our baby.

Yes, it does, obviously!

â™ª â™ª

Makayla!

Back off!

What are you hiding?

What else could there
possibly be?

Give me your phone.

Give me the phone!

Give her the damn phone!

â™ª â™ª

Finish painting.

Think about what you're risking
if you screw this up.

â™ª â™ª

Did you get paint on your arm?

Yeah, sorry.
Don't apologize,

not your fault.

I was distracted.

Eric is...

All over the place?
Exactly.

Don't take it personally.

Once he holds the baby,
he'll forget all about it.

I guess.
I promise.

Now, stay away
from the wet paint.

Just one more ritual left.

We don't want to mess it up.

â™ª â™ª

The young cat
looks to his mother,

but she stays behind.

Thanks for hanging out.

Of course, anytime.

He'll have to climb
this tray on his own.

If my mom calls you,

tell her I'm sleeping.

Okay?

Yeah, sure.

â™ª â™ª

Oops.

Good thing it wasn't
too high up.

He'll have to try again.

This last ritual will ensure

the vitality
of your child-to-be.

Eric, you'll be chanting this.

What does it mean?

I can't tell you exactly.

Just focus on how
it makes you feel.

And at some point
during the ritual,

it'll turn into English.

â™ª â™ª

If you stop, it would be
very, very dangerous.

â™ª â™ª

Go on.

Um...

(chanting in foreign language)


This feels weird.

(chanting continues)


I don't like this.

Eric, Eric!

Focus, Eric, focus!


I forfeit my energy...
It hurts, it hurts!

...my person, myself.

Let me go!

I give it all away
to this, to you.

(chanting continues)

I forfeit my energy...

It's growing!
...my person, myself.

I give it all away
to this, to you.

Make it stop, make it stop!
I forfeit my energy,

my person, myself.
Help me!


I give it all away
to this, to you!

(chanting continues)


â™ª â™ª

Wonderful, Eric.

â™ª â™ª

Honey?

â™ª â™ª

We'll clean this up tomorrow.

Turn out the candles
before you tuck in.

The doctor will be here
sometime overnight.

Sleep well.

I'm... so sorry.


Why are you sorry?

â™ª â™ª

You were begging and screaming,
and I said, uh...

those words.

They're just words.

Just a way to access the magic.

But they felt true.

They're supposed to be.

And there was this thing,
and it was in my chest,

and I couldn't keep it in.

That's love.

That's how I feel
about the person

that's growing inside of me.

But it was... it was...

It didn't feel like love.

It was, um...

â™ª â™ª

It was terrifying.

It's supposed to be.

Here.

â™ª â™ª

Just wait.

It'll come.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(crickets chirring)

â™ª â™ª

(door closes)

â™ª â™ª

Lots of kicking.

(ultrasound whirring)

Just trying to find
the heartbeat.

I saw a picture of your father.

A handsome fellow.

Is it right that our baby
will drink blood?

Eric, what are you doing?
I'm just asking.

You're just trying
to find a problem.

No, I'm not...
He's just anxious.

All guys go through it
as it gets closer.

He's going through a lot too.

Yeah, but...

I know, but still,

it's a process.

My dad, on the day I was born,
drank a bottle of whiskey

and threw up
on the accoucheur.

(ultrasound pulsing)

Right.

The, uh, midwife.

Anyway...

(ultrasound whirring)

The heartbeat.

Nice and healthy.

(high-pitched sound)

Whoa.

A little too loud.


(sighs, chuckles)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(chanting in foreign language)

Morning.

â™ª â™ª

(soft chuckle)

â™ª â™ª

(water running)

â™ª â™ª

(breathing heavily)

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Don't move.

â™ª â™ª


(wood clacking)

Ow, Jesus!

Come now.
What, what's wrong?

(music box playing)

â™ª â™ª

(birds chirping)

â™ª â™ª

Susan?

â™ª â™ª

Susan?

â™ª â™ª

Susan?

â™ª â™ª

(door creaking)

â™ª â™ª

Your blood seeped into her skin,

and now... that...

What the fuck is that?

I don't know what it is.

I'll make a poultice

and call the doctor.

Help her to the bedroom.

â™ª â™ª

Not that hand.

â™ª â™ª

(phone vibrating)

â™ª â™ª

Draw this.

A triangle pointing up
right around the spot.

Then wipe it off
and do it again and again.

That should keep it
from spreading.

Is she okay?

I'm calling the doctor again.

They said he was sleeping,
but he has to get up for this.

(door opens)

(door closes)


â™ª â™ª

My client has an infection
or something.

I don't know what it is.

Yes, that's why I called.

Just wake him up!

(birds chirping)

(knocking furiously)

Makayla, Eric, let me in!


â™ª â™ª

Why are you stopping?

She sounds scared.

What about the baby?

I'll be right back.

â™ª â™ª

Come on.

Makayla, Eric!
Where are you?

Who are you? Shoo, shoo!
Cherise?

Stop! Eric, stop her, stop her!
The bedroom.

Cherise,
what are you doing here?

Come with me.
No, what's happening?

She is dangerous!

They are dangerous!

Makayla, you don't know
what's growing inside of you.

A baby!

A beautiful baby.

Susan is dead!

She killed herself
and her baby.

I saw.

I saw them in the bathroom.

â™ª â™ª

She took pills, and...
and the baby was in the tub.

â™ª â™ª

The baby...


â™ª â™ª

It wasn't a baby.

â™ª â™ª

What... what was it?

â™ª â™ª

Inhuman.

â™ª â™ª

What does that mean?

It had claws, she fed it blood.

We know.
Claws?

Makayla, let's go.
Ouch.

We gotta get you out of here!
No, no, no!

Let go of her!
Stop pulling her!

Ow!
How do you think this happens?

This is not natural!

Cherise, you don't know that.
No, it's not natural...

They were controlling Susan,
threatening her!

Helping her.
This is different.

She couldn't handle being
a mother; I'm meant for this.

Makayla, your baby
is an abomination.

Cherise, how could...
how could you say that?

Please, you have to believe me.

I'm trying to save her.

Cherise, I... I think...
I think you should go.

What?

(Makayla panting)

I'm sorry, I can't.

(growling, screaming)

(guttural growling)

Zekeny, what are you doing?
Get off her, let her...

Eric!


(growling, choking)

Get out!


Wait.


We might need her.
Need her for what?

(Cherise gasping)

Get the rope.


â™ª â™ª

I can't...

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

What's happening?

(muffled scream)

Zekeny, what are you doing?


(muffled screaming)

(screaming stops)


â™ª â™ª

Your baby is sensitive to blood.

You said the licking was fine.

That was her blood.

But yours, when it got
on the skin and it stayed there,

it caused the magic, the energy

that needs to be contained
in the baby, to leak.

Your body is not meant
for magic.

I can heal you, but the medicine
is bad for the baby.

Cherise!
Pay attention.

We need to induce labor now

or you could lose your wife
and your baby.

You gonna let me?


Yeah.


Save them.
All right.

(chanting in foreign language)

â™ª â™ª


Get ready for the big ones
but don't push yet.


(panting, exhaling)


You got this, honey.

You can do it.


â™ª â™ª

Hang in there, sweetie.

It's okay.

It's okay. It's okay.


â™ª â™ª

All right, next time you feel
a contraction coming...

Breathe, sweetie, breathe.
...push as hard as you can.


â™ª â™ª

Push, push!


â™ª â™ª

There she is.

I got her.

It's a girl.

â™ª â™ª

It's okay.


Ola,

we have a problem.

You need to drink this
before anything else.

What's wrong?
It's medicine, drink it.

Is she okay?
We have to be fast.

What's going on?

She should be crying.

Why isn't she crying?
What's happening?

Why isn't she crying?

She's barely hanging on.

What... what is happening?

An infection,
from Eric's blood.


You did this!

It's your fault,
it's all your fault!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

You...

I'm sorry.


I didn't mean it,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Get off!

There's still a chance
we can fix it,

but it's big, costly magic,

not the kind of thing
the foundation does

without total commitment.
Put me down! Get off!

You have to supply the main
component for the spell.

Yes, of course, what is it?

â™ª â™ª

A fresh human heart.

â™ª â™ª

Why are you looking at me?
What's she talking about?

No.

No, no way, no.

I understand.

It's your choice,

but there are no second chances.

â™ª â™ª

Eric.

We're not gonna murder
our friend.

â™ª â™ª

Eric.

â™ª â™ª

Please.

This is our only chance.

This is my only chance!

I love you, and I want
to do this with you.

Please.

I need this baby.

If you're willing
to murder your friend,

for that...

â™ª â™ª

...maybe you're not fit
to be a mother.

â™ª â™ª

Get the fuck outta here!

Get!


â™ª â™ª

Eric, Eric.
It's okay, it's okay.

A heart?

â™ª â™ª

What the fuck is going on?


â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

Enough, enough!


â™ª â™ª

Wait for instructions.

â™ª â™ª

(choking on blood)

Let me flip him over.

â™ª â™ª

Cut down.



Cut through there.

(slicing, grunting)

â™ª â™ª

Now give me the knife, reach in.

â™ª â™ª


â™ª â™ª

(Cherise whimpering)

â™ª â™ª

(Cherise gasping)

â™ª â™ª

Squeeze.

Take this life as your own.

May it sustain you.

Take this life as your own,
may it sustain you.

(baby crying)

â™ª â™ª

What about the friend?

Let me handle her.


(biting, screaming)

â™ª â™ª

(baby crying)

â™ª â™ª

You were worth it.

(baby crying)

â™ª â™ª
