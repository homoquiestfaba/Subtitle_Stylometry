[ Man Narrating ]
In another dimension--

a galaxy far, far,
really far away,

at the final frontier
of space--

Eh, yadda, yadda, yadda.

Does anybody really read these things?
I mean, come on, people.

If you're freeze-framing this scene
just so you can go and read the scroll,

well, what's up with that?

Just because words are
marching off into infinity...

against an outer space
background,

do you think there are some
universal truths printed here?

Well, you're right.
Here they are:

Look both ways before crossing
the street, and obey your mother.

If that's too tough for you, then
look both ways before crossing your mother.

Garfield's Pet Force!

[ Gasping ]

[ Grunts, Whimpering ]

Oh! Emperor!
Emperor!

I've got it!
I've got it!

The Klopman Crystal--
the ultimate power source.

Now I can finally complete
the "moscram" gun--

the molecular scrambler,
that is.

[ Power Charges ]

Take a look at this.
[ Yawns ]

If you please.
Hmm?

Mm-hmm. Ah.
[ Panting ]

Here we have the royal dog--
[ Barks ]

and the court's lawyer.

Now I fire up
the moscram, and--

[ Yelping ]
[ Whimpering ]

[ Both Grunting ]
[ Guards Gasp ]

I scramble
their molecules...

and create a dog who'll
not only bring in the paper--

[ Barks ]

but he'll read it to you
as well.

[ Yawns ] And what's that?
Oh, that.

That's a lawyer
who'll work for treats.

Right, boy?
[ Growls ] Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

[ Yawns ] And whatever you
moscram will be under your control.

Read the paper.

"Man Bites Dog."
Huh?

Oh, the humanity!

To reverse the effect,
we simply--

[ Yelping ]
[ Whimpering ]

[ Both Grunting ]

The moscram can
combine anything.

<i>Its potential uses</i>
<i>are infinite.</i>

What's that button?

That's super-scramble mode.

I'm still working
on that modification.

Well, the whole thing
looks dangerous to me.

Really, Emperor, there's
no need to be concerned.

It isn't that, Professor.
It's-- Well, look around you.

<i>This big royal hall seems</i>
<i>so empty without a queen.</i>

<i>[Cricket Chirping]</i>

The royal bloodline will come
to an end if I don't find a wife.

It's bound to happen soon, Emperor.

Are you kidding?
I'm too dorky even for Dorkonian women.

No. Any woman who'd marry me
will have to come from another planet.

[Engines Whooshing]

<i>[Spacecraft: Landing Thud]</i>

[All Gasping]

People will come from
across the galaxy...

to see the amazing moscram.

Oh, boy. Huh?
<i>- [Doors Open]</i>


Oh-Oh-Oh, oh!

[Slinky Voice]
Hello there.

Oh-Oh-Oh! Welcome!

I mean-Welcome to Dorkon.

I'm Emperor Jon. Uh, Miss-

Call me Vetvix, sweetie.
[Giggles]

Oh!

[Snickering]
Nice place you got here.

Well, Miss Vetvix, I hope
you don't think this is too forward, but-

Will you marry me?
Hmm?

I know I'm not the handsomest guy
in the galaxy...

<i>but I can offer you everything I have-</i>
<i>uh, jewels, my castle...</i>

<i>uh- uh, the keys to my kingdom.</i>

<i>- Um-</i>
Keys?

Why, of course I'll marry you.
Huh?

Wait a minute. You will?

Sure.
Wow!

Did you hear that, Professor?
She said yes!

I heard.
Well? What are we waiting for?

But, Emperor, uh-

Hello.
[Snickering]

[Chuckles] Well-
[Giggling]

Okay.
Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Whoa!
Here you are.

Perfect.
Oh, that's nice.

[Both Yelp]
[Snoring]

Aah!

<i>- ## [Organ]</i>
Hey! Aw.

[Chuckles]
Aah!

[Guests Exclaiming]

<i>- ## [Stops]</i>
[Sighs]

Do you, Emperor Jon,
take this... woman to be your wife?

I doody-do-do!
[Oohing, Aahing]

And do you, Vetvix...

take this man to be your husband?

Why not?
Yeah.

I now pronounce you emperor and queen.

You may kiss the bride.
[Vetvix Murmurs]

[Kissing Noise]
[Snaps Fingers]

Blech!

<i>- [Loud Smooch]</i>

[Emperor Sighs] Oh!
Ew!

Blech! [Spits]
That was... wonderful.

Likewise.
[Sighs]

Now, what about those...
keys to the kingdom?

You bet. Professor.
Are you sure?

Of course I'm sure.
My castle is her castle.

[Groans]
<i>- [Keys Jangling]</i>

Ha!
Hey!

I'll take those.
Honey?

Uh, what are you doing?
Uh, be careful with that, honey.

This is what I came for.

Guards!
In formation!

[All Sputtering, Yelping]

[Loud Karate Yell]

[Yelling]
[Chortling]

[Yelling Continues]


Hee-yah!

[Groans]
Uh-oh.

[Whimpering, Groans]


[All Yelping]

[Zombie-like Groaning]

Your guards are no longer a threat to me.

They're now under my control.

Must obey.

[Yelping]
[Screaming]

[All Groaning]

[Zombiefied Guard]
Vetvix is the greatest.

The moscram ray gun is
the perfect weapon...

for an up-and-coming
super-villainess like me.

[Laughing]
[Professor] Oh, no.

With this, I can mutate
everyone on the planet into my slaves-

step one on my to-do list
for universal domination.

But, honey, if you're off
conquering the universe...

when will we have time for our honeymoon?

[Murmurs]
[Beeping]

You'll never get away
with this, Vetvix...

not if the Pet Force
has anything to say about it.

Nothing can stop me.

We're here to put an end
to your wicked ways.

Bring it on!

Let the fur fly.

<i>[Professor Narrating] Odious-</i>
<i>the canine crusader with a potent stun tongue-</i>

[Grunts]
Wow.

<i>and a black hole where
his brain should be.</i>

<i>- Starlena- whose icy stare-</i>
Don't move!

<i>freezes all bad guys
in their tracks.</i>

<i>Abnermal- quick as a blink with pester
power of cosmic proportions.</i>

Is this your gun?
Hey!

Is this your belt?
What the-

[Grunts]
[Laughs]

<i>And Garzooka-hero ofheroes...</i>

<i>with his gamma-radiated hair balls!</i>

[Murmuring]
[Gasps]

Ha-ha!

Ha-ha-ha!

[Screams]
You're not gonna get me!

[Laughing]
[Yelping]

[Abnermal Head] Vetvix is my master.
[Screams]

Must obey.
All hail Vetvix.


Hmm?

Your Pet Force is no match for me.

I now control them too.


[Vetvix] Hey!
[Gasps]

Got it!

Get Garzooka, you fools!

[All Muttering]

Hey!

[All Panting]

Here, boys!

[All Grunting]

Garzooka!

I must return, Professor.

My teammates are under Vetvix's control.

And only the moscram ray gun
can unscramble them.

<i>We've got to keep</i>
<i>the Klopman Crystal far away.</i>

That'll buy you time to create
a temporary Pet Force to defeat her.

Create another Pet Force?
Exactly.

First, I'll scan the universe
for D.N.A. matches.


<i>Aha! There they are-</i>

D.N.A. matches to your
Pet Force teammates.

<i>- [Pounding]</i>
<i>- [Vetvix] Open up!</i>

Come on, come on.

But they don't look anything like them.

They will when they drink
the matching green serum.

When they do, they'll gain
the Pet Force's superpowers.

The red serum will turn them
back to their normal forms.

Program the coordinates into my rover.
<i>- Let us in!</i>

Hurry, Garzooka!
It's a dangerous journey.

You'll have to cross
the interdimensional barrier.

You can count on me, Professor Wally.

No asteroid storm
or exploding supernova can stop me.

<i>- Open up!</i>
The Pet Force shall rise again...

to battle the insidious-
Escape now!

Postulate later!
Yah!

[Engines Roar]


I'll get Garzooka if
it's the last thing I do.

"Will Vetvix capture Garzooka and use the
moscram ray gun to conquer the universe?

Read the anniversary issue
of <i>Pet Force</i> and find out!"

[Garfield Sighs]
Oh, wow! What a cool story!

What's so cool about it?

It's just a gimmick
to make you buy the next issue.

Speaking of which,
the supersized anniversary "ish"...

has a gold foil-stamped, embossed
holographic glow-in-the-dark cover!

Look!
[Laughs]

And it comes out today! Whoo-hoo!

Get a life, Nermal.
You don't really believe that stuff, do you?

It's not like real life-

like here in the newspaper comics.

What if it <i>is</i> real, Garfield?

I used to imagine myself
the cool ruler of an entire planet.


Uh, stab me another hot dog there,
Your Highness.

Seriously, wouldn't it
be great to get out there...

and really do something
that meant something?

Sounds like that would
mean actually, uh...

getting involved.

That takes a lot of effort.

Anything worth doing requires effort.

Nothing ventured,
nothing ventured, I say.

No pain, no pain.


Well, anything would be more exciting...

than sitting around here watching
pickle relish dribble down your chin.

Where?



Oh. Since when did you
start reading comics?

I'm just lookin' at the pictures.

Mmm, Garzooka's pretty easy on the eyes.

But he's got nothing on me. Hmm.
Huh?


Oh, brother.

[Gasps]
I'll take that.

It's all yours.
[Barks]

I'm here to put an end to your evil ways,
Vetvix.

Supernova? Ha!

I eat 'em for lunch.

Let the fur fly.

Sad.
So sad.

[Barks, Murmurs]
[Jon] What?

Oh. Thanks, Odie.
Hey, gang, we'd better get going.

I wanna get to the studio
early to get ready for the strip today.

[Nermal] Yeah!
Come on, Garfield.

Uh-oh. I- Listen, I'll, uh-

Oh, uh, you guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

So we get there early
to set everything up...

and you waltz in at the last minute.

I'll be there in time for my, uh, close-up.
Oh!

[Sighs]
Hmm!

[Simpering Laugh]

<i>Well, I'd like to see
Garzooka beat me...</i>

in a hot dog-eating contest.

Oh, Jon! Can we stop at
the newsstand? Please!

I wanna pick up that new issue of <i>Pet Force.</i>
Sure.

I am kind of curious about what happens
to that handsome emperor.

[Brakes Squeal]


Excuse me.

<i>- Yeah, down here.</i>
Huh?

Do you have the new
anniversary issue of <i>Pet Force?</i>

Huh? Yeah, sure.
Hey, hey, hey. Careful.

Don't crease it.
That's a collector's issue.

[Alarm Beeping]

[Male Computer Voice] Warning.
Approaching interdimensional barrier.

You know, readin' this stuff
will stunt your growth, kid.

<i>- [Engines Roaring In Distance]</i>
Huh?

[Ground Rumbling]
[Both] Whoa! Oh! Oh! Whoa!

[Rumbling Stops]
What was that?

Maybe it's an alien invasion.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

Don't make fun of me.
Watch your back, kid.

The aliens are comin'.

<i>- [Laughing] What a loser.</i>
[Muttering] Hmm!

[Tires Screech]

Goofy kid.
Who does he think he's foolin'? I-


Excuse me, kind sir.
Do you know these people?

That way.

The universe is indebted to you.

[Sighs, Groans]

"and Garzooka comes out"-
Whoa! I don't believe it.

What?

Thi-Thi-This isn't happening.
What?

We're in the comic book.

Here we are having our cookout.

Look. It even shows me buying
the comic and-and-

Oh, my gosh!
What?

It's Garzooka. He is in Cartoon World.

The D.N.A. matches
to the Pet Force are right here.

So, what happens next?
Um, let me see.

Let me turn the page and-

Hey.
[Gasps]

<i>[Arlene Gasps]</i>

The pages are blank.

Because... it hasn't happened yet.
Oh.

[Doorbell Rings]

Hello!

Hello?

Anybody home?

Hello?

Mmm! Mmm-hmm!

Mmm!

Ah! Mmm. Hmm.

[Grunts, Straining]


I wonder if we've got any relish
that's already open.


Huh?

[Gasps, Stammers]

Comrade.
Mommy!

There's nothing to fear.
[Yelping]

Don't eat me!
Don't eat me! Please!

Eat you?

You have a sense of humor,
my interstellar brother.

I have traveled here to call upon
your help to save the universe.

Uh, hello?

The evil Vetvix has stolen
the moscram ray gun...

and vowed to enslave the planet Dorkon.
Huh?

If she has followed me here...

then all of Cartoon World
is in danger too.

This is a gag, right?

A publicity stunt to promote
the <i>Pet Force</i> comic book.

Come here.

Is there an actor inside that mask?

If I were you, I'd fire my agent.

What are you talking about?

Where are these three?

I need them.
They're, uh, at the studio.

Very well. I shall go and get them.

[Yelps, Grunts]

Vetvix is sure to be looking for me.

I need you to hold on
to the Klopman Crystal.

Wow.
Keep the crystal safe.

It cannot fall into Vetvix's hands.

And remember-
[Mutters]

One cat <i>can</i> make a difference.

Uh, before you go, can you, uh...

open this?

We've lost Garzooka's tracks.

Scan for his exact coordinates.

Cat scan under way.
[Scan Meowing]

We've got to do something.

I'll have a talk with her, Professor.

After all, she is my wife.

Um, honey?
Oh, no.

If you could just give
us back the moscram...

Mm-hmm.
I'm sure we could-

Shut up, dork!

You're only here so you
and your Professor...

can answer any questions
I have about this moscram.

I guess we'll have to work
on our communication.

This happens with new couples.
Oh!

Heh, heh!
[Crackling]


Yes! There he is!

Program the coordinates and prepare
to cross the interdimensional barrier.

Superhero cat from another dimension.

I gotta stop readin' that stuff.

[Ground Rumbling]
[Screaming]

[Loud Clattering]
[Engines Roaring]


[Engines Whooshing]


Nermal, why don't you put that
comic away. We have to get to work.

Just a sec, Arlene.
You won't believe this.

Look!
[Murmuring] Yeah. Look!

This just appeared in the comic!

That's us comin' to the studio.

And look! Here comes another one!


[All Gasping]

[All Scream]

[Nermal Whimpers]

Hi there.
Oh, my gosh!

Oh, my gosh!
It's Garzooka! What are you doin' here?

As fate would have it,
I have come for you three.

You have?
Wait a minute.

You mean, when you left Dorkon
with the D.N.A. serum...

you were comin' to get <i>us?</i>

And with your help,
Vetvix will be defeated.

Dorkon will survive,
and so will Cartoon World.

Are you with me?

Count me in!
Where do I sign? I'm so there!

How are we supposed to help you?

This serum is matched to
the D.N.A. of each member of Pet Force.

The green serum will give us Pet Force powers!

In all of the universe,
only the three of you...

match the D.N.A. of my team members.

Cool!

Uh, has this ever been tested?

There has never been a reason to...
until now.

Drink up, fellow heroes.

The fate of two worlds
hangs in the balance.

What if it doesn't work?
What if it turns us into freaks?

Freaks?


Sweet!


Mmm! Pungent, yet satisfying.

So, fellow freaks, are you with me?

Yeah, yeah! Uh-huh-huh!

[Rattling Yelp]

Oh, here goes.

Blech. So now what's supposed to happen?

You should feel energy,
strength and vitality...

electrifying your entire body.


[Farts]
[Whines]

I don't feel any different.

Me neither.
Uh-uh.

That's impossible.

Maybe your metabolisms are slow.



[Jabbers, Grunts]
[Gasps]

Hmm. I was assured this would work.

Maybe it's just going to take some time.

Time is not a luxury we have.

Huh?

Whoa.

Ahh!

This is the life.

[Ground Rumbling]
[Ice Clinking]

Oh, come on. There wasn't a
cloud in the sky a minute ago.


[Engines Whooshing]
[Whimpering]

[Ground Rumbling]
Mommy!


Huh?

[All Chortling]
[Whimpers]

Huh?

Jon! Wally!
What the heck is goin' on here?

Who are you?
How do you know our names?

Wha-

You're now my prisoner, tubby one.

That's what's going on.

It's true- the story about the Pet Force.
It's all true.

Where is Garzooka?

I scanned for his D.N.A.
and got these coordinates.

Unless... you <i>are</i> he.

Me... he?

Of course. Ingenious, Garzooka.

How you did it, I don't know.

But that is quite a disguise-

hiding yourself within this fat, dumpy,
pathetic little body.

Hey, I hate to break it to you, Miss Megalomaniac,
but you got the wrong guy.

Me wrong?
[Shrieks]

I don't think so!

I'd like to scramble you
with that lawn chair...

<i>but I need the Klopman Crystal</i>
<i>to power my moscram.</i>


Whoa.
## [Humming Nonchalantly]

# Da, da, da, da, dum #

Tell me! Where is it?

Where is what?

Very well. If you want to play that game,
I can oblige.

I'm going to enjoy making you talk.

[Chortling]
[Whimpers, Gasps]

Ooh.

<i>[Chuckling, Laughing]</i>

[Chuckling]
[Laughing]

Hey, what's this, Betty?

Oh. It's my new idea.

I call it the "smile section."

Sort of like a coffee break area...

where people come to think happy thoughts.

Wow. What a great idea.

[Laughing]
Oh.


Hey, it's already working.
Ooh.

See?

All right, people, gather round.

Betty. Betty!

[All Chuckling]
Hmph!

All right, people, let's go.

Quickly, please! Time is money.

Could I have some light down here, Eli.
[On P.A.] You got it.

Thank <i>you.</i>

Let's review today's shooting schedule.

Betty.
Charles. [Clears Throat]

First up, we'll have "Garfield"...

and-and then
the "Life Stinks" comic strip...

followed by "Billy Bear's Woods."

Very well. Now, is everyone present?

I'm here!
We're gonna be here forever.

Where is Garfield?

Uh, he'll be here any minute, Charles.

Where are the others?
Here we are.

Huh? Whoa!

Yeow! Oh-ho!

Huh?

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Holy biceps! Who's that?

Oh, baby!
Is that Garfield?

Not unless he's been
puttin' something in his milk.

Who is this?
It's Garzooka!

He's a superhero.
Superhero?

It's a long story. Whoa!

Excuse me. Are you seeing anyone?

Uh, no.
Oh, that's good.

Because you're perfect and I'm desperate.

Betty, would you please
return to the stage?

I'm stayin' right here with Mr. Muscle.

Betty!
[Growling]

Now don't you go anywhere,
or I will hunt ya down.

You know, this could
be rather fortuitous.

Now, Mr. Garzooka, if you would, please-

[Straining]
Oh.

take the stage.
[Sighs]

You will have to be the stand-in for Garfield.
Ooh!

I don't have time for this.
Here is your script.

Today, Garfield refuses to go jogging.

He states that the only thing on him
that runs is his nose.

[Laughing]
Why would you make fun of jogging?

Exercise and strict diet should be
part of everyone's daily routine.

It teaches kids to grow big and strong-

[All Gasping]

like their favorite superhero.

Awesome!
Mm-hmm!



Hey, uh, this is kind of uncomfortable.

[Muttering]
A little more to the right.

Little more.
[Grunts]

[Spine Cracks]
Ahh. That's it.

You've withstood all of my torture
devices. I don't understand.

I'm a cartoon character.
We're supposed to squash and stretch.

That's what we do for a living.

You may be resilient, Garzooka...

but I'll find a way to make you talk.

For the last time, where
is the Klopman Crystal?

Ow. I told you.

I don't know where the crystal is,
and I'm not Garzooka.

Silence! I must ponder this.

[Snaps Fingers]
Guard!

[Mumbles]
Bring me that lemonade. I'm thirsty.

Um, that's simple enough.

Oh. Huh?

[Chuckles]
[Gasps]

What would it take for you to tell me
where the crystal is?

I wouldn't tell you
for all the lasagna in Italy.

I want that crystal
so bad I can taste it.

Oh!

Stop!
[Gasps] Oh.

Okay, I'll tell you
where the crystal is...

if you'll, uh, just give me
a drink of that lemonade.

What an odd little cat you are.

Very well. Here.

Mmm!

So?
[Mumbling] So, what?

So where's the crystal?

And what's that in your mouth?

Nothing. I just like-

sucking on ice.

Uh-huh.


[Both Gasp]
[Laughs]

You seem to have a
certain glow about you.

Ha!

I have absolutely no idea...

what you're talking about, lady.

Mm-hmm.


Get the crystal!
[Gasps]

<i>[Whimpers]</i>

[Grunting]
[Whimpering]


I got it! I got it!

Look at you!

Oh! Oh, yes!
[Giggles]

Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Look at you!

Yes!

Oh!

## [Humming]

[Ray Gun Fires]
[Laughing]



[Over Speakers]
You're under my control now.

You are my zombies!

Must obey Vetvix.

Oh, yes! Who's back?

I don't know.
Uh-

Vetvix is back. That's who.

And what's she gonna get?

I don't know.
What?

She's gonna get Garzooka.

And then the whole universe! That's what.

# Uh-huh, uh-huh #

# Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh ##

Uh-
Huh?

Say, she's not a bad dancer, is she?

Oh, dear.

Boy, I really blew it.
Yes, you did.

The real Garzooka
would never have been such a fool.

Run the D.N.A. scan again.

And this time, don't make any mistakes.

"Don't make any mistakes."

Always givin' me a hard time.

One day, she'll make a mistake and- Huh?

Hey! We found him.
Program the coordinates.

Garzooka is the only thing that stands
between me and universal domination!

[Maniacal Laughing]

<i>[Machine Whirs]</i>

Oh, hurry up, Wally.
And... take it.

[Shutter Clicks]

Do you notice any change yet?
Just a headache.


I think that juice is givin' me gas.

It's taking too long.
Vetvix could be here at any minute.

Wait. Do you hear that?

No.

<i>- [Engines Whooshing, Muffled]</i>
Oh, no!


Hmm.

Uh!

She's coming.
Who's coming?

Vetvix.
Who's this Vet- [Yelps]

[All Gasping]

[Gasps]
Look out! Look out!

[Vetvix Over Speakers]
Oh, Garzooka?

Where are you?

[All Gasping]

I must get you to safety
until the serum takes effect.

[Odie Whimpering]

This way.

<i>[Vetvix] Come out,
come out, wherever you are.</i>


Whoa!

Oh!

Whoa! What the-

Outside. Hurry.

<i>[People Screaming]</i>
<i>- [Jon] Wait for me.</i>



Stay put!
[Yelp]

Hey.

Don't move!


[People Screaming, Groaning]

[All Laughing]

This is all my fault.

If I'd kept that crystal from Vetvix,
none of this would be happening.

<i>[Whispering]</i>
<i>Garfield! You can still fix things.</i>

How? Pretty soon,
she'll turn Grin City into Zombie-opolis.

Remember the Garzooka credo:

"One cat <i>can</i> make a difference."
How?

Quick. Take my monocle
and put it in the window.

Why?
No time to explain. Just do it!

[Grunts]
What? [Simpers]


Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Here we go.

<i>One, two- Whoa!</i>

What are you doin' over here?
Huh? Nothing.

Come here.
Mmm.

<i>[People Screaming]</i>




Yikes!

Ah.
Go.



Help! The sky is fallin'!
Oh, no! Careful!


[Both Groaning]

Oh!

[Laughs]
[Clears Throat]

He won't stay put.
Well, get rid of the tubby little pest.

Yes, sir!
[Muffled Yelping]

Uh, ma'am. Right away. I'll-

[Gasps, Snoring]

<i>[Grunting]</i>
<i>Watch the fur, would ya?</i>

What's happening?
[Chortling]

You're not gonna-Wait!
[Echoing Yelping]

Whoa!

Maybe someone escaped to the alley.

All right! They made it.

That was only a small taste
of Vetvix's vengeance.

<i>- [Projectile Whistling]</i>
Huh?

[All] Huh?
Oh!


What the-
[Yelps]

Comrade!
[Groans]

Garfield!
It's good to see you.

Oh. Oh, it's good to be alive.

What happened?
How did Vetvix get the crystal?

Ooph! It was horrible.

She tortured me and took my lemonade.

I'm sorry.

Well, you did your best, comrade.

Then I saw you guys on the monitor.

I thought she was gonna
turn you into zombies.

And she still might
if somebody doesn't do something.

But the serum isn't working yet.

We've gotta speed it up somehow.
Oh.

What serum?
The Pet Force serum that we drank!

<i>- [Odie Barks]</i>
Huh?


[Gasps]
Huh?

[Grunts]
Oh.

[Belches Loudly]
[All Moan]

Oh, Odie.
You could change your name to Odor.

[Clears Throat, Gasps]

Whoa!

All right, Odie.

Mm-hmm!
[Shudders]

[Screams]
Do not be fearful, Arlene.

<i>- It won't hurt a bit.</i>
[Yelps]

At least, I don't think so.

Oh. Yeah.

Ha-ha!
Ha!

Man, gotta get me some of that serum.

Not fair.
You guys changed, and I haven't.

Except for the costume.
[All Gasp]

Nothing's happening to me.
My arms are still skinny.

[All Gasp]
I'm not big like you guys.

That stuff didn't work on me.

Nermal?
Yeah.

Do you have any idea how fast you're moving?
I am. [Gasps]

Yeah! Yahoo!

Abnermal! But I should have
my own name. Let's see. Flash.

Taken.
Kid Flash?

Taken.
Quicksilver.

Taken.
The Whizzer?

Believe it or not, that's taken too.

I'm over here. Now I'm here.
Now I'm here. Wha-

How about putting your superpowers
to good use?

Odie, try your new stun tongue.


[Gasps]
Hmm.

Hey, careful where you aim that thing.
Try it on something else.

[All Whimpering]
Careful, Odie.

Cool!

Arlene, try your icy stare.

Hmm.
Now wait just a-


How was that?
Impressive. Most impressive.

She's used that stare
a lot on Garfield...

but it's never quite
worked like that before.

Speaking of Garfield, Arlene,
don't you think you should-

Ah, all right.

...minute there, Arlene.

I'm not gonna-Whoa.

What the heck is going on anyway?

Your friends are now the new Pet Force.

They are going to save the universe.

All right!

Get Garzooka, my zombies.

[Zombies, Monotone]
Must obey Vetvix.

Get Garzooka!

[All Groaning]

Guard!

Yes, sir.
That D.N.A. scanner is useless.

My zombie army will find Garzooka.
Get this ship moving!

Right away.

We've got to find a way
to get the moscram from Vetvix.

But first, we'll have to
bring her warship down.

To do that, we need to get up high.

<i>That's it!</i>

<i>The antennae on top
of that tower...</i>

would make a fine harpoon
for a whale of a warship.

Good idea. That'll bring her down.

[Loud Rumbling]
Whoa! What the-

<i>- [Rumbling Continues]</i>
[All Gasping]

Vetvix is coming.

[All Gasp]

Watch out!

You can't help us with our plan,
comrades.

Keep yourselves safe.

Pet Force, get under here.

Be careful, Garfield.
[Gasps] You be careful too.

[Garfield] Jon, look!
Oh, no.

Hold it. Get down!

Look.
Oh, no!

Hmm.

<i>What? Guard!</i>

<i>[Garzooka]</i>
<i>Quickly.</i>

Yes, sir.
I thought I told you to get rid of that pest.

Huh? But, uh- uh, I did.

I meant for good, you idiot.

Do I have to do everything myself?

Oh, no! She's gonna shoot Garfield.

Welcome to the Fraternal Order
of Vetvix's Zombies.

No!


This sucks!


Whoa!

[Groans, Grunts]

What-What just happened?

You were almost zombiefied. That's what.

Get Garzooka, my zombies.

Must obey Vetvix.

Vetvix rocks.

Looks like Jon just got trashed.

This isn't good.
[Sighs]

Hey, what's that?

[All Screaming]

[Both Grunting]


[Screaming Continues]

Soon I'll have so many zombies
Garzooka will never escape.

[All Groaning]
No! No! [Screams]


Find Garzooka, my zombies!

<i>[Over Speakers]</i>
<i>Get Garzooka!</i>

[All Groaning]
Get Garzooka!

Get Garzooka!

Garzooka!

There's Garzooka!
They've spotted us. Hurry!

They're everywhere.

Get Garzooka.

Hold on tight.

Garzooka-

Quickly. To the tower.

[Zombies Groaning]

[Gasps]
[Nermal] Let's go.

<i>- [All Grunt]</i>
[Arlene Sighs]

Ah.

<i>[Grunting]</i>

Are we gonna be safe here?
Very safe.

[Pounding]
[Glass Cracking]

Well, sort of safe.

[Zombies Continue Groaning]

Okay, not safe at all.

This way! To the antennae.

Arlene, buy us some time.
You got it.


Hmph.
[Groaning Continues]

[Pet Force Panting]

We gotta make sure no one's buried
under all this junk.

You know, Garfield, you should have gone
with Garzooka in the first place.

What do you mean?

When he came to the studio
to get Arlene and the others...

you should have come with him instead
of sitting on your fat behind eating hot dogs.

Eli, it's me, Garfield.

I don't save the day.
I sleep through the day.


You can't sleep through your whole
life, Garfield. You have to get involved.

It's too late for that now.

Maybe being a zombie
won't be so bad, Eli.

You live forever and you don't
have to make small talk.

There's got to be some
way of beating Vetvix.

Do the math. There's a gazillion
of them and only two of us.

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Huh! Make that three.</i>

Who said that?


I did, doggone it!

I'm mad as heck, and I'm not going
to take it anymore.

You're not fighting
anyone without me, Walter.

All right. Bonita!
<i>- [Muffled Shout]</i>

Huh?

[Groaning]
Betty? Are you okay?

<i>Gar- Garzooka?</i>

Is that you?

I'm not Garzooka, Betty. It's Garfield.

Garzooka's at the tower
downtown fighting Vetvix.

He's with who?

Why, that little-
Oh, wait till I get my hands on her.

Eli, is there any way
for us to see what's going on downtown?

Maybe I can tap into
the tower's security cameras. Hold on.

Psst. Look.
[Excited Panting]

Hmph!

Way to go, Professor.

[Zombies Groaning]

<i>[Garfield] Oh, my gosh!</i>
<i>Arlene, Odie and Nermal are surrounded.</i>

They can't get up the antennas.
[Gasps]

That's Arlene, Odie and Nermal?

[Groaning Continues]

Awesome gamma-radiated
hair balls, Garzooka!

[Zombies, Monotone]
Garzooka!

Oh, Garzooka. My poor baby.

We've got to do something!
But what?

What do you mean "what"?
You have your fighting force right here.

<i>My</i> fighting force?

Time to step up, buddy.
Time to get involved.

We gotta do something.

You know, this is just
crazy enough to work.

What do you mean?
Eli-

<i>the big man with the nimble hands</i>
<i>at the controls.</i>

Mm-hmm.
Wally-

<i>- the hen-pecked, half-sized hero.</i>
Ha-ha!

Betty- the man-hungry assistant director.


And the lady with the
big nose for trouble-

<i>super-nag Bonita.</i>

Hey, wait a minute.

And me- the super cat
who <i>can</i> make a difference.

Okay, all we need now is a snappy name.

We don't have time for this.
The Feeble Five.

The, uh, Inferiors?

How about the We're About to Die Gang?

That's kind of a downer there, Wally.

You all crazy!
That's it! The Crazy Crew.

Yeah.
The Crazy Crew? I like it.

Ha-ha!
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.

Okay, gang, here's what we're gonna do.

Now first, we're gonna
get this place cleaned up.

[Groaning Continues]

[Moans, Exhales]


[Nermal Grunting]
Yahoo!

What's wrong, Nermal?

I don't know, Garzooka.
This super speed is making me super tired.

And my eyes are killing me.

Your newfound powers are putting a strain
on your Cartoon World bodies.

I cannot fight them alone.
Are you sure you can't use your powers?

[Nermal] We're too tired.
And the zombies keep coming.

But we must hold on.

[Garfield] We must obey.
Oh, no!

Vetvix rules.

They've been turned into zombies.

Come on, Wally. Whoa-oa.
It's okay, guys.

I am Vetvix. I command you to stop.

Vetvix.
Huh?

Hide under this.

I am Vetvix.
I command you to get Garzooka.

I am the great Garzooka.

Huh?
Garzooka?

Come and get me. Now, Wally, run.

Get Garzooka.
Get Garzooka.

Get Garzooka.

Good going, comrade. Let's go.

Look!

<i>My zombies have found Garzooka.</i>


Faster!

I'm going as fast as I can.

Go faster.

Get Garzooka.


Vetvix's ship is coming. Get down!

Where are my zombies going now?


[Gasps]
[Straining]

What's going on?

Give me a hand!

[All Gasp]
Whoa!

<i>[Vetvix]</i>
<i>The Pet Force!</i>

I thought I left them back on Dorkon!

I am the great Garzooka!

You can't stop me.

Why, I'm more powerful than a supernova.

<i>- [Wally] Whoa!</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[All Straining]


[All Gasping]

[Garfield Panting]

Come on. Follow me, the great Garzooka!

[Zombies Continue Groaning]

Move along, people, please. Come on now.

We're shuffling. We're shuffling.
Move it. Move it.

Oh, no. Oh, no.

[Garfield Gasps]

Now, Eli!
Here goes nothing.

[Beeps]
I am Garzooka.



[Zombies Continue Groaning]

Oh, it's working!

[Zombies Gasping]

Pull!

[All Groaning]

[Arlene Laughs]
[Garzooka] All right!

We did it.

Uh-huh, that's it.
Keep moving.

Move along, people, please.
Straight ahead.

We're shuffling. We're shuffling.

I am the great Garzooka.


That's all of them, Eli.

[Zombies Continue Groaning]

Yes, we did it.
[Laughs]

Yes! Great, man.
[Shouts]

Very good, my new Pet Force.

You seem reenergized with victory. Huh?

<i>- [Humming]</i>
[Gasps]

I don't know how you did it, Garzooka...

but I've had it with
you and your Pet Force.

Whoa!



[Male Computer Voice]
Super Scramble mode engaged. Danger.

Yuck!
<i>- Super Scramble mode engaged. Danger.</i>

Danger.

Super Scramble mode engaged. Danger.
Oh.

Super Scramble.
All right, let's take it up a notch.

[Cocks Hammer]

[All Yelping]


[All Groaning]

Who's your daddy now?

Vetvix. Must obey Vetvix.

This way.
<i>- [Nermal] No, this way.</i>

[Arlene] This way.
[Garzooka] I think this way.

No, this way.

[All Screaming]


Ah, all right, Professor! Way to go-

Shh.

[Untying Ropes]


Hey.

[Whimpers]
[Growls]


They went thataway!
Get 'em before they escape!

Yes!

Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Wait. Where are you going?

No.

Let's see what this baby can really do.


Wow!

[Low Growl]



Come to me, my lovely.



That way!

Let's go get my ship back!


Destroy everything!


[All Grunting]

[Pet Force, Monotone]
Must obey Vetvix.

What can we possibly
do against that thing?

Poor Garzooka.

All is lost.
<i>- [Alarm Sounding]</i>

Huh?

[Male Computer Voice]
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

Look!

Uh-oh.

Let's go.

[Grunts]
[Whimpers]

<i>- [Footfalls On Stairs]</i>
Now!

[All Shouting]
[Both Gasp]

Crazy Crew, meet Emperor Jon
and Professor Wally.

Hi.
[Bonita] Wally?

Me?
Fascinating.

Looks like the Crazy
Crew just got crazier.

<i>- [Roaring]</i>
[Betty Gasps]


Oh, no!
We need a plan.

Like what?
Well, fainting comes to mind.

The Crazy Crew never panics.

Now might be a good time to start.

Good idea. [Groaning]
No, no, no, don't do that.

You can't save the universe that way.

<i>- [Roaring]</i>
[Gasps]

Eli, you better get the Crazy Crew to safety.
You got it.

Time for me to get involved big-time!

Uh, can you guys give me a lift?
Of course.

My ship, it's getting away.

No!

Okay, Professor, pull around and
drop me off at the monster there.

Emperor, I hope this works.

Well, we'll give it the old royal try.
[Air Whooshes]




I told you to grab my ship, not break it.

[Low Moan]

Hey, Vetvix.
[Gasps]

Yoo-hoo. Neener, neener, neener.

[Growls]
Whoa!


[Laughs]
Huh? [Gasping]


Whoa-oa!



No-o-o!
[Roaring Continues]

Mmm.

No!




Huh?

Yoo-hoo, Pet Force.

[Inhales Deeply]


Come on. You can do better than that.

[Groans Loudly]

Whoa-oa! Ow! No.
Hey, Odie.

Hmm?
Got tongue?

[Gasping]
[Gasps]

[All Screaming]

Nice shot.


Time to take out the trash.


Get Garfield.

Okay.
Get Garfield.

Get Garfield.

[All Groaning]

Gotta run, guys.

Way to go, Garfield.
[Cheering]

There's still one more thing to do.

[Moans, Coughing]

<i>- It's all over, Vetvix.</i>
Oh!

That's what you think, tubby.

You'll never stop me.

Stop right there.
What the-

[Whimpers]
Say "cheese."

Huh? What-
Huh?


Have a nice day, everybody.

Yes!
Whee!

Open the pit, Eli.
You got it.

[Zombies Groaning]


[Sighs]
[Sighs]

Hi.
[Laughs]

<i>- [Door Bangs Open]</i>
Huh?

Good job, comrade.
I knew you could do it.

Oh!
Uh, Betty. W-Wait.

My hero.

Your Highness.
Oh.

Looking good.

Might be a good idea to keep this
locked up from now on, Professor.

I've learned my lesson. Once I use it
to reverse the damage done on Dorkon...

I'm going to destroy it for good.

I wanna thank you all
for what you've done.

And thanks from the people of Dorkon too.

<i>Emperor Jon. Hi.</i>

Oh. Oh, excuse me.

What can I say?

I was a bad girl.
[Sighs]

Can you forgive me?
Hey, nobody's perfect.

Of course I forgive you.

Oh, boy.
No.

<i>[Kissing]</i>
The new Pet Force was very courageous today.

But now I'm afraid you're going to have
to relinquish those bodies.

After all, there can
only be one Pet Force.

But I don't want to. I like being fast.

You don't need that superpower, Nermal.

You're a pretty super kid without it.

[Laughs]
Aw.

[Grunts, Gasps]


Hmm. Hmm.

[Gasps]
Oh!

[Barks]
[Groans]

Welcome back, baby.


Well, we've gotta be going.

And again, thank you all.

You're the real heroes today.

Farewell.

Oh, uh, Nermal.

This is for you.

Ha-ha! Sweet.

<i>- [Laughs] Garzooka.</i>
Whoa. Whoa. Betty!

So long, Garzooka.

Until next we meet, comrades.

<i>So long, Garzooka.</i>

We'll never forget you.


<i>- [Engine Roaring]</i>
Oh, no.


Oh, well. Third time's the charm.


They're renewing their vows.
Oh, isn't that romantic?

I once again pronounce
you emperor and queen.

You may now kiss the bride.

[Lips Smacking]

[Gasps]
<i>- [Kissing]</i>


[Guests Cheering]

[Fireworks Bursting]

Hmm.


What are you doing out here, Garfield?

Oh, I was just getting
a breath of fresh air...

wondering how much
I've missed out on in life.

"Missed out on"?
Yeah.

By not getting involved more often.

Well, you haven't missed out on me.

Hey, what do you wanna do tonight?

Save the universe?
Yuck.

Fight evil wherever it may lurk?
Boring.

How 'bout-

Oh.
Wow.

Dancing.
Now you're talking.


Whoo!
[Laughs]

Ooh. Oh!

There we go.
Whee!

[Both Laughing]

Wonderful.

[Arlene Laughs]

Ooh!


[Both Laughing]

Whoa.

Hey, is that the Big Dipper?

[Arlene Laughs]

Hey! It's the real Pet Force!

[All Cheering]

Betty?

I'd say you're going to need
a new assistant director, Charles.

Nermal's the name.
Here's my card and résumé.

Have your peeps call my peeps.
We'll do lunch.

[Both Laughing]
