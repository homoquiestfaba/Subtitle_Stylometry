You know, I always say there's nothing
better than Rose's roasted pork.

Why, thank you, Norman.

If I'd known, I would
have made you some.

That's lamb.
Oh.

Norman can't tell one
white meat from another.

But I can, and it's
delicious. Thank you, Rose.

Oh, it's the least I can do,

considering you're supporting
my son's family these days.

It was a loan.
Just to tide them over.

You know, if you need money, you
only got to ask me. You know that.

More lamb, Norman?
Don't mind if I do.

I don't understand how young
people can get by these days.

Not hungry, Eileen?
How's the job hunt going?

You looking for a job?

She got fired after 23
years of loyal service.

Mary rose, eat your beans.
Excuse me.

Ok, girls, bath and then bed.
Can I read?

Nope. It's a school night.
I still have homework to do.

I thought you said you did it all.
I forgot.

There's a cat.
I don't see anything.

It's just somebody's pet, girls.
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

There it is. Oh! Oh, look.

Oh, it's just a baby.
Can we keep her?

Her name is Rusty.
That's a boy name.

No, it isn't.
She looks hungry.

Dad, can we keep her?

Aw!
I thought you said 6:00, Dante.

I thought I heard 6.
O was sitting at the bar. It was noisy.

Well, what was it? Was it 6 or was it 7?

Now you have me worried
about the whole fucking thing.

I wouldn't steer you wrong, Ralphie.
No? Like the guy who sold you that hat?

You like it, huh? It's my
trademark. Like Lester Young.

Who the fuck is Lester Young?
You don't know Lester Young?

I thought your trademark
was a Red Sox cap.

Not me. I hate baseball.
You hate baseball? What?

What are you, a fucking towel head?

Fuck you. You don't even know
who Lester fucking Young is.

Ay yi yi.

Ah, here we go. What's this?

That's Michael Caffee. I told you, see?

Just 'cause he's meeting some
guy doesn't mean he's buying coke.

That's what I heard. He's trying
to take over the action on the Hill.

What's with the warehouse?

Maybe they're swapping skins.

You know, mutual masturbation?
Read about it at city vice.

Oh, you read about it? -
Fuck you. - Fuck you, too.

Let's go in.
No. Let's be patient. Let's wait.

Come on, Michael Caffee's
been jerking us around

since he got back. You know that.
Yeah.

I'm fucking starting to get pissed, too.

Let's see who Michael
Caffee's doing business with.

All right.

Get out of the car, Dante.
Get out of the fucking car, Dante.

Shitholes! How am I
supposed to get home now?

What the fuck...

We're almost to Mass.

If we cross that state
line, we lose him.

Well, pull him over on expired tags.
Right. Hit the lights. Yeah.

Put your hands up!
Show your fucking hands!

Let me see your goddamn
hands! Jesus! Fuck!

Is he dead?
There's no fucking gun, Ralph.

He had a gun. I saw a fucking gun.

You fucking called a gun, but I
don't see a fucking goddamn gun.

Bullshit. He had a gun.
There is no fucking gun in this car.

There's no fucking gun in this car,

and you just fucking
air-conditioned this douche bag.

Jesus! Ah, fuck.

Is this your fucking gun?
Fuck! Jesus Christ.

They will fire me. I will
lose everything. My pension.

23 years down the fucking
shitter. - You killed him? - Shit!

Jesus Christ, Michael.
What the fuck happened here?

Get out of here, ok? go. now. Ralph,
we're calling it in, all right?

Jesus. Who is this fucking guy?

Said his name was Morrill.
Lives outside of Attleboro.

Ah, Jesus. He's wearing a fucking wire.
Oh, fuck!

The guy's an informer, an
undercover cop or something.

Let me see that thing.

Get the fuck out of here. this
is evidence. Go. Right now.

Ralph, we don't have a choice,
ok? I am calling this in.

I wouldn't do that if I was you.

Well, you're not me,
so shut the fuck up.

You guys just shot

an unarmed black law enforcement officer

for no good reason.
They will crucify me.

Just stop your whining,
Ralph, all right?

You're not gonna starve.

Worst thing that'll happen is you'll get
a job as a security guard or something.

You'll be fine.
Why don't you get rid of the body?

What the fuck are you
doing here anyway, huh?

I saw you tailing Morrill.

Thought I'd follow you, see
what the fuck was going on.

He's right.
What?

He's right. We got to
get rid of the body.

No. This is crazy.

It is not your ass on
the line. It's mine.

This is crazy.
You didn't even fire your gun.

You'll skate. Go with me on this.
No. this is crazy. I can't.

You two guys did me a
favor killing this creep.

So why don't you just
let me help you out?

Michael Caffee is not
your fucking friend, ok?

He's trying to save
his own ass right now.

Use your fucking head
and do the right thing.

Fuck you.
Call it in.

The job's all I got, Decco.
Hey! How do we do this?

Go home. Go home.
Fuck you.

Go.

Look, Alex, I want a comprehensive
list of every out-of-state developer

who's petitioned the
E.D.C. in the past 60 days.

There's 2 companies? That's it?
Damn it. What's this doing here?

Rusty got hungry.
It's supposed to stay in the box.

Ok. Give me the docket for
today's zoning board meeting.

No, no. For the entire
city. You know, I warned you.

I wasn't thinking clearly.
You should've stopped me.

No. Today, ok?
Immediately. Get back to me.

I need $15, mom. -
For what? - Yearbook.

It's due today.
Check in my pocketbook.

Don't let it scratch your uniforms.

Oh, shit.

The first fucking car I
ever bought with my own money

was a '73 dodge charger.
your money?

Yeah, so to speak.
I need you to make it disappear.

Why? it'd be a fucking shame to
get rid of a nice car like this.

Oh, hello, nigger. Anyone I know?

He was wearing a wire. He's
probably some kind of cop.

Get rid of him. Today.

I got to work the register at the store.

So close early. - I'll
lose money. - Who cares?

I care.

Well, close early tonight,
open early tomorrow morning.

It all balances out.

No. No one's gonna
know we're open early.

Just get rid of it.

Fucking piece of shit.

Hey. Morning.

Did I drive?
No, baby. You were good.

You called me.

Well, at least I didn't puke, huh?
You wanna bet?

Oh, yeah. I flushed your
cigarettes. Thanks a lot, babe.

Always looking out for me, huh?

Hey, what was the name of
that refrigerator repair guy?

Sergei... Vlad... something
like that. Russian. I don't know.

Probably just gonna have to
get a whole new one anyway.

It's not even keeping
anything cold anymore.

You're probably just cramming
it with too much stuff.

No, I am not.

Besides, the ice maker
hasn't worked in over a year.

I am so sick of buying
ice at the market.

We can't afford a new
refrigerator right now.

You're just gonna have
to fuckin' deal, ok?

I thought we weren't worrying
about money right now.

Sorry.

What's wrong?

It's nothing.

Good morning. First order of business.
We've got a missing fbi agent.

His name is Jack Wyatt.

He was up here on an
undercover assignment,

investigating hijacked
semis along the mass pike.

Tons of merchandise
disappears every day.

Refrigerators, TVs, VCRs,
clothes, you name it.

In any event, the feds
have asked for our help.

Who are you?
I'm Ellis Franklin.

I've been sent up to replace Ned Mays.
What happened to Mays?

Same thing that happens to
everyone who can't deliver.

Transferred to Alabama.
Lucky guy.

Agent Wyatt's last reported
contact was at a gas station

near the connecticut state
border. That was yesterday morning.

FBI, huh?
Yeah. FBI.

They sent over this photo. Check it out.

Carbone and Wiley are downstairs
with a potential witness right now.

I'd like you two to liaise with them,

and if you come up
with anything, call me.

Refrigerators.

I killed that poor spook
over hot refrigerators?

It looks like it.

Fuck. You don't think
somebody saw us, did ya?

How the hell do I know?
With all those goddamn trucks going by...

Do we have to talk about it?
Somebody could've seen us.

Do we always have to fucking
talk about everything? Do we?

Can you shut up for once?
Is that too much to ask?

Well, there was 2 cars.
They looked the same to me.

Kind of dark-colored, uh, Sedans.
Like I said, I was on the highway

about a quarter mile down the road.

Mr. Sullivan, detectives
Giggs and Magno.

Mr. sullivan here was taking
a little nap in his car

on the side of the road last night,
and he was awakened by a noise.

Gunshots. Woke me right up.
So, you heard a sound.

Yeah. then I sat up and saw a flash.
You saw the flash after the sound.

Well, there was more than one flash.
You definitely saw a man fire a gun?

Like I said, I was about a
quarter of a mile down the road.

Couldn't see much of anything,
but... Yeah. I saw a guy fire a gun.

And why did you stop there, Mr.
Sullivan? You were so close to home.

I had a long day. I sell vacuums.

I cover the whole state. I must've
put 300 miles on my car that day.

I was tired.
And had you been drinking?

Well, uh, I had dinner with a
friend down on Kingston, and...

Yeah, I had a cocktail.
Just one?

Maybe a couple.

Well, which is it, Mr.
Sullivan? One? A couple?

I don't know.
You don't know.

Why don't you just start by
telling us what you do know.

Take a bigger hit than that.

This is pretty good
stuff. Where'd you get it?

A friend.

I didn't know you smoked, Mary Rose.

I bet your dad doesn't know.
Why? Are you gonna tell him?

Just after I tell my dad.

Hello.

You thieves figuring out how
to divide up the weekly take

or just trading horses?

Hey, Tommy. How's it
going? How's eileen?

Ah, we're squeaking by.
Davey.

Listen, I'll see you at
Sunday church, Maureen.

I seriously doubt that, Tommy.

Buy you a beer, representative?
Thanks for the thought,

but we've been waiting 3
months to get on the docket.

We're not going anywhere.
3 months. That's a long time.

Care to tell me what the problem is?
My problem is them.

Reverend Westlake's parishioners
have generously raised

a substantial amount of
money to build a new church.

But without zoning board approval,
they can't close escrow on the land.

Who did you offend?

Mr. Manfredo and Mr. Vieria

are upset about the proximity
of the proposed church

to their neighborhood on the Hill.

Your celtic compatriots have
chosen to side with them.

Oh, don't worry too much about
Davey and Mrs. Downing, Jerry.

They're not bad people.

They just need a little
help to see the light.

Do you have a real estate
agent representing the purchase?

Why would I need an agent?
Everyone needs an agent, Reverend,

to grease the wheels.

Mr. Caffee here is himself an excellent
and fully licensed wheel greaser.

Tommy Caffee.

Hey. Beer?

I went back to the warehouse.
the one in pawtucket?

Why?

Gee, I don't know. Investigating?

You find anything?
Oh, yeah.

Copiers, construction
equipment, refrigerators.

2 whole floors of stolen goods.
Fucking Michael Caffee, huh?

Oh, he's definitely up to something.
He may not be selling drugs,

But whatever it is, he's fucking rich.

Can't do shit about it now, can we?
Because of me?

Yeah, because of you.

Well, if that isn't the pot
calling the kettle black.

What the fuck is that supposed to
mean? Dina Finnerty. Slow Charlie.

You really put the screws to your
pal Mike Caffee there, didn't you?

Completely fucking different
situation, and you know it.

Fuck you.
You know what?

You compromised our fucking
friendship. You took advantage of me.

You turned me into your
silent fucking partner.

You shot an unarmed law
enforcement agent. What the fuck?

I was doing my fucking job,
trying to protect the both of us.

Well, now we're both in bed with
Michael Caffee, thank you very much.

Mary Rose, is that you?

You girls have got to
take care of that cat.

What's wrong with it?
It's out of control.

You promised you'd take care of it.
I've been at school all day.

I've got more to do with my day

than spend it running
around after a cat.

What are you doing? - I'm hungry. -
Supper's in an hour. - I'm hungry now.

How about feeding the cat?
Did you buy any cat food?

No.
Then how am I supposed to feed it?

Call your dad and tell him
to pick up some cat food.

Oh, he's gonna love that.
Too bad.

Just what were you doing all
day that you were so busy?

Set the table.
Whatever.

And don't use that tone with me.

Hello. Hey.
Hey, it's me.

What do you say I take
you to dinner tonight?

Lobster and martinis.
What are you so happy about?

I made a sale today.
Great.

I'm gonna be able to
pay your dad back, too.

Huh. well, I got kids to feed
and help with their homework,

plus I got bills to pay,

and plus I got a cat
clawing up the furniture.

So tonight's not a good night.
Ok. I'll sse you later, I guess.

Tommy. Would you pick up some cat food?

Sure.
Thanks.

And then there's the O'Neal funeral,
tomorrow at 9:00. Did you know her?

Who?
Molly O'Neal.

Yeah. She was a bingo
friend of my mother's.

Then you probably ought
to go. Ah, it's after 7:00.

You want me to call Eileen,
tell her you're on your way?

No.
No?

I'm gonna have another
drink. You wanna join me?

Sure. Scott's in New York tonight.

Just me and that spoiled
maltese bitch of his.

Hmm. we got a cat. I hate cats.
Hello. Kevin, two. Another round.

Yeah, Scott thinks the
dog's good practice for us.

What, are you two
thinking about having kids?

Hmm... huh?

Well, someday. But
why spoil a good thing?

Kids are great.
So is sex. - Yeah.

Thank you. How long have
you guys been together?

4 years.
You're amateurs.

Well, it's the longest relationship
either of us has ever had.

Well, I wish you luck,
my friend. I really do.

Thank you.

Ow! Ow! Stop it.

Oh! Goddamn it. Shit.

Fucking cat.

Mommy! Mommy! Mom! Mom! Mommy!

Mommy!

Rusty's gone! Mom, Rusty's gone!

I was gonna feed her,
but we couldn't find her.

Oh, god.
We looked everywhere.

She's probably just sleeping
somewhere. You know how cats are.

Mike, we got to find a
new place to bury people.

We've run out of room
under the overpass.

Anyway, they got all
this oil down there.

It causes cancer, you know.

That's all I could think about
when I was digging the fucking hole.

Am I gonna get cancer?
Absolutely not.

You're gonna die of something
else way before you get cancer.

Is that Sean? - Yeah.
How's he working out?

He's not one of our best.
Teach him a lesson?

No. I gave him a warning. He's only 12.

Hey, it's the young
ones you got to watch.

Those cocks, they got no
fear. Remember us back then?

What is this, dover?
Yeah. who's that?

That's got to be Willie. What the...

Mary Rose?

Get in the car and wait there.

What'd I tell you? Huh?
She's 16.

That was my 13-year-old
niece, fuckstain.

Get out. Get out the car.

Rusty.

Here, kitty, kitty. Rusty.

Here, kitty, kitty.

Sit down. - I'm not hungry.
I didn't ask. Sit down.

2 number 4s, 2 waters.

What?

Are you stupid?
No.

'Cause only stupid people
do drugs. Stupid and weak.

I don't think of you as stupid,
and you never struck me as weak.

So... what's going on?

2 number 4s.

George says they're on the house.

That's very thoughtful of
him. Thank George for us.

Are you gonna tell dad?

Why? You think I should?
No.

No?

You're a Caffee. Caffees don't do drugs.

You understand?

All right, eat up.
I don't like stuffies.

Taste it.

Mmm. Not bad, huh?

You're a Caffee all right.

Mmm.

Ok, I'll let you out here so
your mother doesn't see us.

Thanks.

It's all right. I don't
think she approves of me.

She doesn't.

Mary Rose. I know a lot
of people around here.

Nothing happens on this hill that
I don't find out about eventually.

If you ever try to buy
so much as a cigarette,

you don't wanna know what
I'll do. You understand?

Ok.

They found Wyatt's car. The
plates had been switched,

but they matched the vin number.
Yeah?

Abandoned at Logan
airport with a body inside.

It's not our guy, though,

so I guess this is
Boston P.D.'s problem now.

I need you two back on Freddie
Cork. keep me in the loop.

Fucking Michael Caffee.

Fuck.
Yeah.

Hey, Decco. Dater.

Listen.

I don't expect any
special treatment from you.

Your job's your job.

You got to do what you got
to do. I understand that.

I respect that.

Just 'cause I did you guys a favor,

I would never ask for
anything in return.

As far as I'm concerned, we're even.

You know, silence is argument
carried out by other means.

Tommy.

Norman, I hope I didn't pull
you from anything too important.

No. Not at all.
Here. Uh...

What's this?
That's a check for $15,000.

I thought you said
you needed this money.

Not anymore. I, uh, made a sale.
That was fast.

I got an advance on my broker's fee.

I told you you didn't need
to pay me back right away.

I wanted to.

Look, Tommy, about
dinner the other night...

Norman, it's... Listen, I got to run.

I got a corporation's committee
meeting starting in 20 minutes.

But thanks again, huh?
All right, Tommy.

We'll speak soon.
Take care.

Mary, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

Hey, Mike! Mike!

What?
There's somebody here to see you.

Mary Rose, what you doing
here? You should be in school.

School's boring.
Of course it's boring. It's school.

It's important. You got to learn.
I'd rather hang out with you.

Wanna hang with me.

I don't think so. Come on.

Let's get you to school before
they catch you playing hooky.

Come on. Let's move.

All right. If you have
nothing to do after school,

Why don't you come back. You
can work the cash register.

It'll teach you something
about people. All right?

Ok.

You know her daddy's
not gonna like that.

My fucking register.
Rusty!

Rusty! Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty! Here, girl!

Girls, I don't think he
would've made it this far.

He might have. Rusty! Rusty! here, girl.

I have an idea. Why don't we go
home and we'll make some signs.

I'll hang 'em up tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

Rusty!

Why don't we go get some
ice cream after dinner, ok?

Come here, Rusty. Where are you? Rusty.

Where the fuck are you?

Goddamn it. Where the fuck are you?

Hello.

What?

Hang on.

It's standard procedure.

But she passed the breathalyzer.
I want her released.

Mr. Caffee, she was erratic.

You know, we lost a
cat. Kids are a mess.

That's why she's running in the woods

at 2:00 in the morning,
barefoot, in her nightclothes?

No. She got scared of you
guys. Can you blame her?

Yeah, listen, Alex. It's me.

Get me the scituate chief
of police on the phone.

No, no. It's fine. It's just
a little misunderstanding.

How did the girls'
kitten end up in scituate?

Because I dumped her there.
You what?

She was driving me crazy, ok?
Eileen...

What's the matter? Come
on. Just... What's going on?

Talk to me, please. Just...
What's the matter? - Yeah.

I'll tell you what's going
on. I'm a horrible person.

A cat killer. Lock me up
and throw away the key.

What can I say? Sometimes
people do irrational things.

Are you on something?

Oh, Tommy, come on.

No. I wasn't on anything.

Here's your coat. Mary
Rose, here's your coat.

Ok, Noni, you have ballet
today. Leotard's in there.

Lila, your permission
slip's in the back pocket.

Ok, bus is here. I love you.

I ironed your shirt for you.
