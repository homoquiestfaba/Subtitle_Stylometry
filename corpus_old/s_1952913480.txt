You see, this is our gang.

They were all supposed
to end up as sausage.

I don't know where he is now.

Maybe he's searching...

Before the war my father ran
a movie theatre in PoIand.

He used to teII OIiver
aII about fiIm.

OIIie used to say that had he
not become a pianist,

he wouId have been
a fiImmaker.

He especiaIIy Iiked the
stories about

cameramen waiting for
the magic hour.

You know what I mean?

It's that short moment
at dusk and dawn

when the Iight creates
this gorgeous effect on fiIm.

My father used to say
that every person...

has such a magic hour
in their Iife...

in which aII dreams came true.

ShouId I speak PoIish
or EngIish?

PoIish.
Very weII.

Ahh, competitions!

They're the salt of the
performing arts.

A necessity of every pianist.

They are the key
to briIIiant careers.

They create an equaI
opportunity for everyone.

They aIIow us to discover
and promote the best.

With our awards,
we, the judges,

announce them to the world.

THE WINNER

My father loved tango.

And Oliver took it from him.

But my son cound't play such music...

Grandpa,

this tango is for you.

Is this it?
No, OIIie.

This isn't your magic
hour yet.

LittIe OIIie, even before
we Ieft for the States

kept asking us how one
recognized their magic hour.

Dad would only smile
mysteriously.

We visited him for the
last time

after Ollie won the
Montreal competition.

Soon after dad died,

taking his secret with him.

Mr. Linovsky,
pIease come cIoser to us!

Mr. Linovsky, how come you
never toured PoIand?

I'm mean you were born here.

Since your defeat at
the Chopin's competition,

you've stopped pIaying
Chopin's music. Why?

But you wiII pIay Chopin in WrocIaw. . .
Are you afraid of this concert?

Did you know that the peopIe
stiII Iove you?

That music Iovers from aII of
PoIand wiII come to Iisten to you?

I'm very pIeased.

Thank you very much.

Maestro, weIcome!
I'm so pIeased. We're aII happy.

I knew your mother,
even before she was married.

She was an incredibIy
taIented pianist.

If it onIy wasn't for that accident. . .
Ok, Mr. JuIiusz.

Thank you.

You knew very weII

that you were supposed to bring
him to the restaurant.

We waited with the mayor
for two hours!

I tried, sir, but he refused
taIk to anyone.

After that phone caII he
toId us to Ieave him aIone.

Then he just sat down at the
piano and began to pIay.

And he pIayed wonderfuIIy.
I don't give a shit how he pIayed!

You shouId have made him stop.
Do you understand?

No, I don't.

I don't have to go to Europe
if that's what you decided.

Fine, so she did.

Besides that's not important.

Your tour is the onIy thing
that matters now. Yes?

EspeciaIIy the opening.

Do you understand?
EspeciaIIy the opening.

You have to conquer WrocIaw!

OnIy then you'II win.

I don't want to hear from
you if you faiI.

What am I saying?

You cannot faiI. Ok?

We're a few minutes Iate.

But we aIways wait for
the audience.

Too bad the mayor is not here.

Was he offended?

What did you expect?
After what happened. . .

Ok, I'II come Iisten after
the intermission.

Did you save me a seat
in the front row?

Of course.

I'm sorry.

What's going on?
No idea.

The doors, doors!

I meant cIose the doors,
you idiot!

Hey, WaIdek! Give us a bottIe
and shots for everyone!

The Professor's paying.

Intuition again?

Not onIy, my friend.
Not onIy.

The usuaI?
Of course.

WaIdek get him a taxi.

He's staying in the hoteI.

Did you see that?
The guy's from Chicago.

So what?

Nothing.

If you don't have time
for anaIysis

and you don't know
the horses

because the races are
in EngIand or France. . .

I check the monitors to see
how the IocaIs are pIaying.

RegardIess of the nation,
race, convictions,

90% of the bettors Ioose.

To win, you've got to bet
against the majority.

Dubito ergo cogito,
cogito ergo sum.

So it's not just the facts?
Interpretation of facts.

''Imagination is more
powerfuI than... ''

KnowIedge.

AIbert Einstein.

Do you remember your sayings,

especiaIIy the ones before
the exams?

''Concert Cut Short for
Quarter Million Euros''
It's ''game time eagIes''
or the one about the frogs?

Wow, the kid got himseIf into
some troubIe...

Who?
The guy in the photo.

I met him yesterday at the bar.
HoId on, I'II get the paper.

What's going on?

KaroI, do something.
Don't just stand there.

Take him to the restaurant.

Ok, but I'II charge that
to your account.

What account?

Your empty one.

OIiver,

teII me something.

I'm mean you're pretty famous.

You've pIayed concerts,
you've mad recordings.

How can somebody Iike you
be broke?

Because a pianist aIways
comes Iast.

Have you ever seen horse
races?

What?

No.

HoId on.

Sit, sit.

Nothing's happening yet...
You see the grey horse.

Do you see him?
Fourth position.

HoId on.

Now Iook.

Look at the grey one.

He's hidden,
but he'II make a break for it.

Now!

Now! Look.
Look what's happening.

Look. Did you see that?

You know what OIIie?

I think...

I just had a decent idea.

That grey horse, Ruten,

we'II keep an eye on him.

This is an odd pIace.

I spent more than haIf
of my Iife here.

What's up?

Champ!
What's going on?

What are you pIaying today?

Which races? PoIish or foreign?
We'II see, we'II see.

Sit down, OIIie.

New guy, does he pIay?
AbsoIuteIy!

He Iost 250 thousand
Euros yesterday. Right, OIIie?

You're shitting me. Where?

Ask him, but he doesn't
speak PoIish weII.

Whatever. TeII us how you're
going to pIay.

Here you go.

No way. FabIes yes,
but Dandy in the third?

No chance.
He's out of shape.

How about in the second?
I'm skipping it.

Four horses have a shot
at winning.

Are you aIso not pIaying
in the second?

Paderewski.

What about Paderewski, OIIie?

He'II win.

What?

Paderewski? Maybe if he grows
a fifth Ieg. He's dead meat.

I wouIdn't be so sure.

Last time he Iost by 1 7 Iengths.

He's a rag.
Tadziu, caIm down.

Let's go.

What's he up to?

How are you betting?
WeII, sweetheart,

give me...

Maybe not.

We'II bet Iater.

This is the city's
wonderfuI girI.

She's a IittIe weird.
She reads books,

Iikes cIassicaI music.
Mr. Frank,

I think I've seen this gentIeman.
Somewhere before.

ReaIIy?
It's Mr. OIiver Linovsky.

Come on.

Why didn't you bet?

I have to think something over.

I've seen something invisibIe.

He's caIIed ''Horse'' or ''Banker''.

He used to be a jockey.
He came here from BuIgaria.

He seIIs information about
horses from PoIish stabIes.

Nobody knows if it's true.

Anyway, do you know what
he'd say about Paderewski?

If he knew anything,
of course.

Horse good - second time.
What does that mean?

It means that a good horse
that's running after a Iong break,

wiII take it easy in order
to win in the next race.

And today is the next race?

Let's go. We'II skip Dandy.

Ok. In the first race
give me fifteen.

And Paderewski in the second.
Paderewski?

Here you are.

But speak to me in PoIish.

Which is FabIes?

Do you see him?

We just won 400.

Let's get out of here.
It's stuffy.

TeII me about the army?

They shipped you straight
to Germany?

To BerIin.

I wasn't even 18 years oId.

I Ieft my girIfriend
in the States.

I didn't know she was pregnant.

Then I got a Ietter that
she died in chiIdbirth.

What about the kid?

Never seen him in Iife.

His name's Jack and he Iives
in Chicago.

Ok, OIIie, Iet's go.

They're racing.
Paderewski's running.

Is that Paderewski?

Someone gave you a tip?

Good job.

Everyone was mad at me.
My entire famiIy.

Here was I,
with an American passport,

first in Germany
and then in PoIand,

in those hard times!

I got married.

Then I found out that
I had a kid in the States.

I didn't know what
it meant to be a father.

I was a kid myseIf.

We'II win and you'II go back.

Ok?

We'II win and I'II go back.

. . . . What was that about?

The abiIity to read...

Paderewski's got great papers.

What happened with that
Iast horse, Dandy?

He won, that's aII.
But why didn't you bet on him?

A mistake.

I've got no excuses.

If I ever want to change my
bet to somebody eIse's, hit me.

Ok, but I'II charge that
to your account.

You'd beat the oIder?

Damn it. We won't make it.
I have 15 minutes.

How did you become so honorabIe
aII of a sudden?

You can pay tomorrow?

How much did Max send you?
Not even 1 0 %.

He took off.

OIIie, I don't know.
I have a probIem.

Hi!
Hi, sweetie.

HeIIo, Mr. Frank.
HeIIo, Iove.

For Grandma.

Listen, OIIie.

Ruten's about to run in Paris.

It's that grey horse
I showed you at home.

I remember.

It's his first race in France.

He's up against some
good horses.

He Iikes a wet track
and Paris has had dry weather.

So Iet's not pIay him.

I aIready did.

I'm sorry.

I Iike him.

How so?

A PoIish horse,
but born in the States.

It's going weII. Look.

Don't Iet them pass you!
What are you doing?

What was that?

You got it?

I won.

I can't beIieve this. How couId
he Ioose on a horse Iike that!

He couId've won the race.
Damn it.

It's a great horse.

We can win a fortune on Ruten.
Do you know why?

Because in the west countries
he'II aIways be an underdog.

Why?

Because he's from PoIand.
So what?

PeopIe know that PoIish breeding
isn't as good as in the past.

But they're forgetting
that he's bred in the USA.

If he won today. . .

Just think of that.

But he didn't.

Do you beIieve we'II win?

Yeah...

It's impossibIe.

How couId you cheat? In every
race you have 1 0 horses,

1 0 owners, 1 0 trainers,
1 0 jockeys,

and each one of them wants
to win.

Maybe in smaII races...

What?

Some coffee?

Good idea, good pIace.

You shouIdn't reject intuition
but you shouId support it.

With anaIysis, Iogic.
WeIcome, professor. Lunch?

No, thanks. Just coffee.
Is Hubert in?

He's with some new empIoyees.
ShouId I get him?

Don't bother him. Two coffees.
Of course.

Concerning intuition,

a guy comes in to the track
to bet on horse number 5.

And as he waIks over
to the counter,

intuition appears above
his head and says:

''Put it on 2, put it on 2''.
He says I don't want to pIay 2.

Intuition says ''Put it on 2. ''
Ok, I'II pIay 2.

He puts his money on 2.
The horses take off.

2 is in the Iead.
He runs very weII,

but in the Iast moment 5 takes
off and wins the race.

The guy yeIIs ''Oh, shit!''

and intuition repIies
''Oh, fuck it! ''

That's intuition.

Chris, may we?
Go ahead.

I don't know what to say.

ReaIIy.

What are you doing?

Are you crazy?

Did you see how they Iistened?

Did you see them?

Everyone.

Waiters, cooks, bussers,

with gaping mouths.

They stood and Iistened with
gaping mouths.

You pIayed wonderfuIIy,
OIIie. ReaIIy. I swear to God.

I've never seen anything
Iike this.

And to think you've pIayed
cIassicaI music in a joint Iike that,

I tip my hat.

You're right,

now I can onIy pIay in joints
Iike that.

It's over.

You know what?

I'II show you something.

Where is it?

In May of 45,

Truman came to Potsdam to
sign Germany's capituIation.

Everyone was trying
to come up

with a way to ceIebrate
this occasion.

They were Iooking for a pianist
or orchestra to put on a concert.

FinaIIy someone remembered that
we had pianist in our battaIion.

They said he wouId've
had an impressive career

had it not been for the war.

He pIayed Rachmaninov,
Beethoven.

Anyway,
he pIayed for Truman.

He was briIIiant.

At one point the President joined
in and they pIayed together.

Do you understand?

They pIayed together for
haIf an hour.

A kid from our battaIion
and the president.

The crowd was wiId.
The peopIe screamed.

Later he said that before the
concert he nearIy shit his pants.

He hadn't pIayed for a year.

What was his name?

Liszt.

Eugene? Eugene Liszt?

Eugene Liszt.
How do you know?

He was my professor in
the States.

You're shitting me?

Gene was your teacher?

I'm sorry.

I can't promise that.

Yes, that was before
the accident.

Why are you asking about this?

It's irreIevant.

They wrote that I was
a tyrant to my son.

That I forced him practice
6 to 8 hours a day.

Maybe...

It's true,

I didn't aIIow him to pIay baII,

ride a motorcycIe.

But it was my duty.

My duty as a mother and artist
to his great taIent.

Over here.

He aImost fainted but
he's conscious.

Your father wiII stay with
us for two, three days.

Then we wiII reIease him home.

We've Iucked out this time
but I warn you

that his condition
is a preIiminary to heart faiIure.

PIease don't disregard this.
No more smoking, no more drinking.

He shouId get pIenty
of fresh air and waIking.

I take it he doesn't move
around too much?

A change of cIimate wouId
do your father good.

That's impossibIe.
He won't go anywhere.

Try to convince him.
It's important.

''Happy Birthday to our
favorite Math teacher''

''HOW TO UNDERSTAND A HORSE? ''

Got it! This one?

Yes. Thanks.

But I can't pay out today.
Ok. HeIIo.

Got the programs?

You were smoking.

Me? Never.

It didn't fIush.

Give me the programs.

WeII, what did you choose?
The sea or mountains?

OIIie,

no montains.

I'm not going on any vacation.
It costs a fortune.

Besides, vacation in the middIe
of the racing season?

I won't Iet you go back
to that smoky betting pIace.

Listen. I can't afford a vacation.
Don't you get it?

Yes, we can.

What do you mean, ''we can''?
You won the Iottery?

Maybe there's something
I don't know about?

I haven't paid them anything.

I'm not going anywhere.

Because on the IocaI track
you can win shit, not money.

You were supposed to taIk
to me in PoIish.

Fine, then I wiII teII you
in PoIish!

How dare you taIk to me
Iike this?!

How dare you!

What do you know about Iife?!

Where are we going?

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to offend you.

Most of these horses here have
gone though heII, Iike BeIIa.

They were saved from
''the transport of death''.

She used to be the top
cIass race horse.

But when her career was over. . .
Let's go say hi.

. . .And it turned out she's barren,

the owners decided to seII
her to a sIaughterhouse.

But fortunateIy Frank
showed up.

This is my beIoved BeIIa.

She used to be a pretty
young girI.

Now we're a IittIe oIder,
huh grandma?

We won quite a few money
together.

What is it? Here you go.

AII of them are racehorses?

Most are farm-horses,

which are treated the worst.

LuckiIy, ScarIett showed up.

She started a foundation
with her husband,

and now I heIp out aIong
with other voIunteers.

I'm paying BeIIa's rent.

If you hadn't distracted her,

she couId've sent my goddamn coupon.
I couId've won 20 thousand.

Your ''idea'' doesn't interest me.

Why?

Look who's running.

You can't bet on him here.

ExactIy.

I don't understand.

Frank knows?

I'II teII him today.

I didn't come for you.

I can see.

How much money do you have?

What money?

For Baden Baden.

TraveI, stay and about a thousand
to pIay. Do you have that?

We're going?

We're going!

But remember, this is a Ioan.

The track isn't as dry
as they say it is.

If it rained for at Ieast 2 days,
Ruten wouId be unstoppabIe.

To rain.

I thought you wouIdn't
need me anymore.

What do I need you for?

Your German contact?

No,

a PoIish equerry.

He says Ruten is in top
condition.

AIso, he gave me a tip
in the fifth.

You said that tips aren't
reIiabIe.

Let's go.

See? The equerry's trust
worthy.

But we're stiII Iost?

This gentIeman doesn't pIay,
does he?

Just for fun.

It's more Iike finger exercise.

Good one, finger exercise. . .

Professor KarIoff is
a great pianist.

He teaches around the worId.
Once aIso in PoIand.

Do you gentIemen have
time tomorrow?

I'd Iike to invite you for some
champagne to ''Roemischbad. ''

It's not far from here.

UnfortunateIy, I have to say no.
I have business to take care of.

Too bad. And you OIiver?
I'd Iove to but. . .

You have tomorrow off.

WeII then?
At four by the thermaI pooI.

See you.

I don't Iike the fact...

that you didn't pIay
in WrocIaw.

OIIie, 3 thousand peopIe
came there.

They came for you,

for your taIent.

I know, but...

How?

I wouIdn't trust that professor.

Intuition again?

No.

I think he Iikes to pIay
with peopIe.

I thought a Iot about
you today.

Is it true that you broke off
your European tour?

You've aIready heard?

Dear OIiver,
may I caII you that?

You know our circIe.

You shouIdn't have done it.
I hate to meddIe in your affairs.

It'II be difficult to get
back to. . .

My pIace in the Iine?

The queue wasn't too Iong.

CouId you wait for me
by the tabIe?

I'm pIeased.

Dieter!

Did you know, that not Iong ago,

I considered you the greatest
taIent in the worId? Not onIy I.

If it wasn't for that
unfortunate competition...

Remember?

I took away your victory
in Warsaw.

What?

You know professor JakowIew?

After the second round
of eIiminations

he approached me with
a proposition.

I wouId Iend him one point,

in exchange for two in some
other competition.

I don't understand.

A simpIe favor.

I subtract a point from his
pupiI's most dangerous adversary.

Then, in the future
he wiII return the favor.

That's absurd. It's impossibIe.
You must reaIize,

that aII artistic competitions
are fiction.

Think about it.

How can you measure
and compare

the immeasurabIe
and incomparabIe?

Competition is a vioIation
of art. It feeds on it.

The ruIes of chivaIrous
rivaIry are a charade.

Those courtesies,

or vuIgar swindIes,

are an every-day affair.

I understand your feeIings.

StiII, I reaIize that you must
return because you're exceptionaI.

The newspapers caIIed him
,,the big Iooser''.

The jury?

Of course, they cheated him.

OIiver said something...

that sounded pretty naive
and sentimentaI -

that the prize didn't matter...

but onIy the music...

and those who Iove it.

OIIie! Are you asIeep?

OIIie?
No.

CIose your eyes.

What do you hear?

I don't know.

That's the sound...

of 25 thousand Euros!

OIIie I did it!

I figured it out aII by myseIf!
You see, that's what I toId you!

AII the favored horses Iost.

I got Iucky outsiders three times.
Three times!

Now onIy Ruten has to win

and I think I'II go to those
god-dammed States.

Pack your things.

Now?

Now the gentIemen are
changing hoteIs,

because they can afford it!

It's beautifuI.

For your wife?

No,

for Mom.

Very nice.

Why didn't you buy anything?

What couId I say to my grown up
son whom I never met?

Son, I bought you
a shiny watch?

If I was him, I'd kick my
ass off the stairs.

So you're not going?

I don't know.

Frank,

Iet's get whisky.

She hired ''mechanic''.

A mechanic.
What?

She hired a mechanic.

Then what?

Nothing.

A few days Iater we went
back to the States.

You didn't try to Iive
your own Iife.

I'II take a waIk. Ok?

OnIy you and I wiII know

that you were truIy great
on the day of your demise.

Perhaps it's just a whim?

Or perhaps it just amuses me
to appaII the music worId.

I'm afraid you have
no choice, OIiver.

Where were you?
You were gone a Iong time.

Did those professors Ieave?
Yes.

I did it differentIy.

I thought we were waiting
for Ruten.

I aIready pIayed him.
For how much?

Come, come!

I pIayed for everything
we had.

For 25 thousand Euros
at 7 different bookies.

Different combinations.

In each Ruten is in first pIace.

Exacta, trifecta and win.

For every exacta they pay
out 1 00 to 1 .

For a trifecta
700 even 800 to 1 .

And we got that multipIied by 1 000.
Got that?

For every 1 00,
we get 1 00 thousand.

For every 700,800 times 1 000.

At the track you can win
onIy what's in the pooI.

1 00 thousand maximum.

But the money at the bookies
is separate from the pooI?

That's the whoIe point.

OIIie,

we can win a fortune!

Even a miIIion.

MiI..?
Quiet.

MiIIion Euros.

With one condition.

Ruten has to be first.

And if he's second?

That's not an option.

We Ioose.

Are you asIeep?

I can't sIeep.

BeautifuI rain, huh?

Ruten must be getting
impatient.

OIIie! We're screwed!

Shit!

What?!
It's aII gone!

What?! How?!

Ruten is finished!
He has breathing probIems. Fuck!

But. . .

How much money do you have Ieft?!
A thousand, maybe.

Give it to me!
We have to hedge out bets.

The race has started!
Fuck!

Ruten won!

You hear! Come one!
Come one!

HeIp!

Frank wake up!

After winning he'd aIways
bring money for the poor kids.

He wanted to buiId
a daycare center,

ever since the city shut
its down.

He pretty much avoided church.

He said that he didn't
need a middIeman to taIk to God.

Now we can start.

RafaI!

Did you know that Frank
was twice imprisoned?

First time during the StaIinist
era for his American passport.

The communists considered
him a spy.

Then during the 80's
martiaI Iaw he got arrested

for the distribution
of banned Iiterature.

After that his famiIy in
America stopped taIking to him.

Did you know about that?
I just don't know why.

It's hard to say.

My guess is out of ignorance.

They didn't understand
the situation.

Your hand!

Hand, OIIie!

Fix it.

''If you're reading this,

it means that we've missed
each other.

I'm returning to Poland.

For ever.

I wanted to do so for
a long time

but I didn't have enough
courage until now.

Your disappearance and broken
off tour thought me something.

I understood that you need
time to find yourself, despite me.

Be happy, however you want''.

Come on, guys!
Frank is back!

See you soon.
