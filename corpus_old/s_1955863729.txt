[faucet squeaks]

-[hanging man groans, grunts]
-I got you.

[in Japanese] Guard!

Guard!

[in English] I got you.

-[grunting]
-[man] Come here, you.

[man 2] Get on your knees.

-[guards grunting]
-[prisoner speaks Japanese]

[man 3]
Are you proud of yourself for saving him?

Youâ€™d better mind your own business.

You thought you could get this note out?

What is this?

[cries out, grunts]

[man 3] Look.

What is this?

Iâ€™m asking you! What is this?

I donâ€™t speak Japanese.

Throw him in solitary.

[guards shouting]


[man 3] Nobody knows that youâ€™re here.

Youâ€™ll never get out of here.

[hanging man yells]

-[blows landing]
-[guard shouts]

[helicopter passes overhead]

[door opens]

[shouting, gasping]





[faint chatter]

Get out of the way.


-[groans]
-[door slams]

Food.


Kiyoshi.

[in English] My name is Kiyoshi.

Nick.

I need your help.

When someone tries
to commit suicide in prison,

they take you to the hospital.

Once I am there,
my brothers will come for me.

And then, I will have them come for you.

Okay?

[guard speaking Japanese]

[guard 2 speaking Japanese]

[guard 2 shouting in Japanese]

Break is over!

Go back to work.

-Walk!
-Hurry!

Hey! Go!

Hey! Walk fast!

[sniffles, exhales]

I need you to keep me from dying
and make sure the guards come.


[in Japanese] Guard!

Guard!

Hey! Hey!

Help!

Help!

Hey! Hey!

Help!

-Be quiet.
-[Nick] He cut himself!

Number 129. Emergency!

Ring the emergency bell!

[bell ringing]


Emergency!

[guard 2] The emergency bell!

[ringing continues]

[door slams]


One, two. One, two. One, two.

-Move!
-[guard 2] Go to work!

[guard continues cadence in Japanese]

The entire Shiromatsu family

would like to start by thanking you
for what you did for our member.

Do you speak Japanese?

[in English] A bit.

[in English]
Kiyoshi says we should offer you a job.

We have a problem
with one of your fellow Americans.

We have tried to reason with him
for a while now.

Maybeâ€¦

you could help us with that.

Yeah, maybe I could.

Good.


Come visit us. Weâ€™ll give you a discount.


[man, woman laughing]

[loud chattering]

Wait here.

Get some sleep at an inn.

Someone will pick you up tomorrow.

Wait for them.

[in English] Hey, cowboy.

American beer?

Itâ€™ll be 100.

One hundred?

Yeah.

-[laughing]
-[Nick] Okay.

Youâ€™re pretty good.

Hold on a second.

Here.

[in Japanese] Thanks.

Beer?

[man in English]
Canâ€™t believe you punched that guy.

-[in English] See the way he looked at me?
-He was a little out of line.

-Right.
-[man] Letâ€™s make some money.

All right.

-[man] Excuse me.
-[man 2] Excuse me.

[people shouting in distance]

[horn honking]

[train rumbling past]


-Park over there.
-Yes, sir.

[in English] Good luck.

Letâ€™s go over to Mr. Panettiâ€™s office.

Mr. Panetti?

I got a guy out here,
says heâ€™s here about a contract.

Just give him a minute.

Look,
Iâ€™m sure you got respect for these people

because they wear silk pajamas

and they bow like youâ€™re the fuckinâ€™
sun god when they pour the coffee.

Frankly, I donâ€™t give a shit
about their rules or their traditions

or whatever the fuck it is
that youâ€™re here to try to explain to me.

We won!

Whatâ€™s the point in winning a war

if now you gotta worry
about steppinâ€™ on Japsâ€™ toes?

-I wouldnâ€™t call â€™em Japs.
-Okay.

-So youâ€™re one of those.
-One of what?

I got a deal with the United States Army.

Your fuckinâ€™ country gives me metal
at two cents a cubic yard.

Do you know
where they get this metal from?

Any idea?

They get it
from breaking down war machines

that these fucking Nips built
to sneak attack us.

So excuse me
if they gotta buy it back from me cheap.

Now, I donâ€™t know
if youâ€™re banginâ€™ some slanty-eyed broad

and youâ€™re gettinâ€™ all gooked-out
and sympathetic,

but thatâ€™s the way it is.

-Thatâ€™s the way it is?
-Thatâ€™s the way it is.

And now,
you can get the fuck outta my office.

[Nick grunting]

-[Panetti grunts, wheezes]
-[exhales deeply]

Heâ€™s all bloody.


[in English] Did you kill him?

Heâ€™ll live.

[in Japanese] Letâ€™s go.

[up-tempo jazz playing]

Brother,
recently Iâ€™ve been doing some impressions.

-Let me see.
-May I?

Itâ€™s a worm.

And nowâ€¦ two worms.

-[laughing]
-[Kiyoshi] Thatâ€™s not funny.

[big man] You canâ€™t say itâ€™s not funny.

[in English] Nick. Your turn.

A penguin walks into a bar.

Says to the bartenderâ€¦

â€œHey, have you seen my brother?â€

Bartender looks at the penguin and saysâ€¦

â€œWhatâ€™s he look like?â€


[in Japanese] A penguin walks into a bar
and asks the bartender,

â€œHave you seen my brother?â€

â€œWhatâ€™s he look like?â€
â€œA penguin, of course.â€

Everyone, laugh.

Laugh. Whatever it means, laugh.


Shit, itâ€™s them.

Itâ€™s the Seizu family.

This is our city.

Hey, you, calm down. Sit down.


Smart move.

This is our territory. Go home.

The Yankee warehouse,
think you can get away with it?

We made a deal with the GIs, not you.

The warehouses are ours now.

Hey, handsome, listen up.

You came in here and talked to us,
like your boss told you to.

Thatâ€™s impressive.

Weâ€™ll pass it on, if we donâ€™t forget.

with the Americans,

but that wonâ€™t make this port yours.

Get it?

You expect me to take you seriously

with this little white kitten
at your table?

Oh, ho! You have a cute face.

Then why donâ€™t you take him home
and pet him?

No, you keep her.

You havenâ€™t heard the news in town?

The name Shiromatsu means nothing anymore.

Your boss is half-retired.

Heâ€™s blind to whatâ€™s coming.

Shut up.

[Kentaro chuckles] Itâ€™s true.

If your boss and our previous boss werenâ€™t
on good terms,

I would destroy your family.

Itâ€™s the other way around, idiot.

Next, we will take your women.


while weâ€™re at it.

Just like we took your port
before you knew it.

Go home.

-[woman screams]
-[Nick grunts]


Let them go.


Donâ€™t come back, fool.

Iâ€™m going.

Where are the dancers?

Dance!


Cheers.

Cheers.

[child singing]

[singing continues]

[singing stops]

[singing resumes]

[car horn blaring]

[horn blaring]

[women chattering]

Whose place is this?

Yours, if you want it.

Itâ€™s nice.

[key clatters]

Think about it.

Thereâ€™s a suit in the closet.
Should fit you.

[men laughing and chattering]


[shouting continues]

Let me join you.

[shouting stops]

How much?

Why isnâ€™t anyone saying anything?

-Who is in charge? You?
-[man] No.

Iâ€™m asking whoâ€™s in charge.

You?

Is it him?

Whatâ€™s your name?

Kimura.

So youâ€™re Kimura.

Nick. Kimura.

I want to ask you.

If my friend Nick was looking
to play cards in Osaka,

should he ask you?

I donâ€™t work with Americans.


Who are you?

You have a family in the Osaka docks?
Are you the boss?

I donâ€™t know.

Who owns Osaka?

Iâ€™m asking you. Who owns Osaka?

I wanna hear it.

Who is it?

Who owns Osaka?

The Shiromatsu.

Say it again.

-Shiromatsu.
-Wrong. Say it once more.

Shiromatsu.

Itâ€™s â€œMr. Shiromatsu.â€

Stand up.

Sato let me use this place.

Weâ€™ve been friends with Sato
since the old days.

I hear you threatened to tell his wife
that heâ€™d slept with one of his actresses.

He got her pregnant.

Itâ€™s your child.

She says you raped her.

Hey. Itâ€™s over for today. Off you go.

If you have any debts,
pay them to Akihiro Shiromatsu.

Never play in Osaka without paying.

Hurry up and get out.

[gamblers murmuring]

Now.

-Iâ€™ll pay if you want money.
-Pay.

How much is the Shiromatsuâ€™s usual cut?
Iâ€™ll pay double.

Okay, pay.

[in English]
He wants to know what Shiromatsuâ€™s cut is.

Canâ€™t you even negotiate
without permission from your white dog?



Donâ€™t make such a fuss.

Arenâ€™t you being dramatic?

Donâ€™t weep.

This is what happens
when you resist the Shiromatsu.

-[choking]
-[Kiyoshi grunting]

[Kimura gurgling]


[people laughing]

Why is he still hanging around here?

What do you mean?

That <i>gaijin</i> has already served
his purpose, hasnâ€™t he?

Why? He doesnâ€™t mean shit to me.

You sure?

Donâ€™t worry. Itâ€™s fine.

Whatâ€™s fine?
Iâ€™m asking you if you owe him a debt.

And I said no.

Listen, Kiyoshi.

He doesnâ€™t care about you or this family.

Send him away.

Okay?

He doesnâ€™t like me very much, does he?

Whatâ€™s the story with his fingers?

[in English] When you dishonor your boss
and you want to show remorse,

you give your finger.

Itâ€™s called <i>otoshimae</i>.

I see youâ€™ve got all your fingers.

I guess I got lucky.

[whispering in Japanese]

-[in Japanese] Iâ€™ll go down there now.
-Yes, sir.

[in English] Stay here.

[band playing mambo]

[singing in Spanish]




I get it. Let me go.

What are you doing here?

What does it look like? Iâ€™m dancing.

-I told you not to come here.
-Why? Whatâ€™s wrong?

-No reason. Just go home.
-No.

Donâ€™t test me.

What would you do if the Seizu men
walked in with guns in their hands?

Why would they come? Where are they?

Iâ€™m saying what if they came?

Nick.

[in English]
Take my sister home. Sheâ€™s drunk.

[in Japanese]
Thatâ€™s enough. Heâ€™s taking you home.

Go home.

[in English] Thank you for taking me home.

Yeah.


Iâ€™m gonna close the door now.

Youâ€™re very beautiful.

Thank you.

Youâ€™re welcome.

-You want to come inside?
-Yes.


[engine starts]

[rain pattering]

Morning.

[thunder rumbling]

I should go.

You should.

[thunder rumbling]

[clears throat]

Orochi says the US Army is shipping guns
back to the States.

Their plan is to sell some of it
before it leaves the port.

The US Army cannot know
that the Shiromatsu is involved.

Makes sense.

You will have to do this on your own.

I understand if you wonâ€™t do this,

but if it goes right,
everything will change.

And if it goes wrong?

It will come down on you and no one else.

Sounds like fun.


[in Japanese] You hear that?

This is our water. This is our port.

Your dead friend knew that very well.

He said youâ€™d sneak in tonight
to buy all the guns before us.


Your skin is so soft.

Should I lick it?

Brother, I canâ€™t find it.

Where is the money?

[in English] Where is the money?

Shoot him.

[in Japanese] Burn the truck afterwards.


-[man] Lower the gun.
-Brotherâ€¦

Lower the gun!

[in Japanese] The guns?

-Where are the guns?
-I donâ€™t know.

Father, I apologize.

It was my idea.

Two Seizu men are dead!

[in English]
It was my idea, not his. I killed them.

Speak Japaneseâ€¦

or Iâ€™ll cut your throat!

If you kill him,
youâ€™ll have to kill me first.

Are you choosing this <i>gaijin</i>
over your family?


We brought two million yen in cash.

But the Seizu didnâ€™t find it.

In other words,
someone told them where it would be.

Isnâ€™t that so?

Nick put it under the engine block.

They only looked under the seats.

Whatâ€™s going on? This couldâ€™ve only
happened if someone told them.

Who sent you?

I sent him.

Osaka is ours,
and I sent him to make a statement.

Are youâ€¦

the new boss?

Are you the new boss?

[Nick grunting]


He fucked Miyu.

That night when you asked him
to take her home.

He is no different from the Seizu.

He takes what he wants.

Wait outside.

Please allow me to do the same.

Good.

[elevator bell dings]

Father.

The Shiromatsu man is here.

Can that man still be trusted?

Yes.

Itâ€™s still fine.

Who is the traitor?

[in Japanese] I donâ€™t know.

If you knew, would you tell me?

Yes.

You have no family.

You have no home.

You are a stray dog.

But todayâ€¦

you may have a home.

You have to decide.

You can drink and join meâ€¦

or you can stand here, outside.


[in English]
Grab the <i>sakazuki</i> and take it.

they have become father and son.

Everyone, we will now clap.

Ready.

[all clap]

Congratulations.




[cheering, laughing]

[helicopter whirring]

[in English] Sheâ€™s 28 years old.

She can meet whoever she wants,
marry whoever she wants.

But not me.

Not <i>yakuza</i>.

The people here, they cannot love anyone.
You understand?

What if I promised you sheâ€™d be safe
with me?

What if I told you that before the war,

four men killed Akihiroâ€™s wife
and his son?

Akihiro found them and for three days,

he kept them alive,
begging for their deaths, their mothers,

while he cut off everything
that identified them as human beings.

<i>Yakuza</i> can never have that.

To become a <i>yakuza</i> is a choice.

You trade one type of family for another.
You can never go back.

So why does she work for you?

So I can watch her, keep her safe.

I have many brothers, but only one sister.

She was a virgin.

I donâ€™t think so.

Donâ€™t see my sister.

Congratulations.

Now we are real brothers.

[men laughing]


-[Orochi] Letâ€™s go.
-[all] Yes, sir.

Do you know what your tattoo means?

Do you know what it means?

Itâ€™s a fable.

The koi fish who can swim up a waterfall

becomes a dragon.

It means youâ€™re arrogant.

What do your tattoos mean?


-Mine?
-Yeah.

Do you get the same one as me? [chuckles]

-[Nick] You have two koi fish.
-I do.

One swimming upâ€¦

and one swimming down.




<i>I guess, in life,</i>
<i>sometimes we fight the current.</i>

<i>And other timesâ€¦</i>

Seizu tells me
he has a business proposition,

but he doesnâ€™t have the respect
to meet in person.

He sends a kid like youâ€¦

and this <i>gaijin</i>.

Do I look like a radio salesman?

Iâ€™m not selling you radios.

Iâ€™m selling you stock.

In ten years,
theyâ€™ll be making more than radios.

After the IPO,
theyâ€™ll be pouring money into research.

TV, automobile technologyâ€¦

[in Japanese]
They have a subsidiary in the US.

Good for them.

Where is Seizu?

Heâ€™s in Kobe.

He offers you this opportunity
for a joint venture.

He offers meâ€¦

indignity.

Seizu wants my family to come
under his command, and not only thatâ€¦

he wants me to pay you?

I am just a representative.

And weâ€™re talking about ten percent
of millions in dividends.

In US dollars.

With 400,000 shares, we could make
500 million yen in ten years.

All the Kobe families are participating
in this investment.

Are we in Kobe?

I will not come under the command
of Hiromitsu Seizu.

He doesnâ€™t have the guts to pay meâ€¦

but he sends me this college grad boyâ€¦

to beg for my money.
Not to a man like that.

Iâ€™m just saying
this sounds like a smart investment.

Letâ€™s have the non-Japanese
leave the room. You, leave.

[in English] Nick, get out.


Why? You know Iâ€™m right.

Itâ€™s not for us to decide.

Father doesnâ€™t want a war against Seizu.

Heâ€™ll bow to him all day long.

Heâ€™ll offer our fingers,

but then he spits at Seizuâ€™s money
for his honor.

Heâ€™s stuck in the old ways.

You really think
he should share investments with Seizu?

He would rather die.

If you donâ€™t take it, someone else does.

Youâ€™re too drunk.

Yeah, Iâ€™m drunk. So what?

My head still works fine.

[in English] Stay, brother.

You and I never really talked.

You see that guy?

When I was little, I didnâ€™t go to school.

I worked.

One day, I walk homeâ€¦

and a <i>chinpira</i>, a wannabe gangster,
puts a knife at my throat.

He takes my money, 200 yen.

I go home to my father.

Heâ€™s drunk. Angry.

He takes his glass.

I bleed every fucking place.

I run.

I run all the way to the river, crying.

A boy comes to me.

He says his name is Kiyoshi.

He walks with me
back to my fatherâ€™s house.

He takes a metal pipe.

He breaks my fatherâ€™s head.

From that day, I am <i>yakuza</i>.

And Kiyoshi,

he is my brother.

And nowâ€¦

You understand?

<i>Gaijin</i>.

You understand my English?

Huh?

[Kiyoshi clears throat]

Thatâ€™s enough. Go home.

Whatever you say, brother.

[clears throat]

Sorry, heâ€™s busy.

-[Orochi in Japanese] Move aside.
-Heâ€™s busy.

Youâ€™ve turned into a beautiful woman.

To whom do you owe becoming such a beauty?

Hmm?

-Whatâ€™s this?
-Donâ€™t touch me.

-Try and stop me.
-Stop it.

Iâ€™m not the same person I used to be.

Me neither.

What are you doing here?

I missed our times together.


We were over a long time ago.

I know.

Lonely, arenâ€™t you?

You canâ€™t hide whatâ€™s inside your heart.

Youâ€¦

-You still care about me.
-Stop it.

Why do you tell me to stop? You like thisâ€¦

No.

Stop.

You wanna be a whore?

That white bastardâ€™s whore?

Why do you like him? Tell me.

Huh?

What does he have that I donâ€™t?

Tell me!

[Miyu gasps]

You think heâ€™s going to protect you?

Is that what you really think?

If thatâ€™s the case,
I will make you a whore.

Like every bitch around here.

No, no, stop it! Let me go!




Sorry.

[muffled introduction]

[muffled cheering]

[muffled cheering]

[crowd cheering]


[referee shouts]


[speaking Japanese]

[crowd cheering]

Itâ€™s the Shiromatsu.

I heard you were insulted
by my representativeâ€™s offer.

I was insulted by you.

You think I have no respect.

I respect you more than you think.

Let me speak with respect.

Iâ€™m offering to build a fence around youâ€¦

to invite you into my garden.

There, you can retireâ€¦

and live for years.

What about my family members?

They can join my family.

They can do as they please.

As long as they do not form
any new family in Osaka.

You call thisâ€¦

an offer of respect?

You understand nothing
about your fatherâ€™s generation.

We are wolves.

Weâ€™re not dogs.

Can you keep wolves inside a fence?


Careful on your way back to Kobe.


Nick fuckinâ€™ Lowell?

You gotta be fucking kidding me.

-Wow.
-You look fuckinâ€™ good for a dead man.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hey, itâ€™s me. Itâ€™s Paulie.
Just on weekend leave.


You got somewhere you need to be?

Or you got five minutes for an old friend,
Captain?

Congratulations.

Itâ€™s bullshit.

Three years in Okinawa.

Thereâ€™s no one fighting anymore,
so whatâ€™s the point of this?

I donâ€™t know.

You ever go out there?
Where they dropped the first one?

No.

I did.

The fuckinâ€™ rats
almost built it all up again.

Look at you.

Looks like made
a good fuckinâ€™ life for yourself,

dressed up like a lounge singer.

You live here? Osaka?

I got a little place.


You werenâ€™t always so calm and quiet.
You know that?

Maybe you just didnâ€™t know me so well.

No, I guess not.

I got leave for another day.
I should come by, see your place.

No.

-No?
-No.

Your five minutes is up.

-Is that how it is, huh?
-Yeah.

Canâ€™t drink with a guy
from your own fuckinâ€™ unit.

Congrats on your stripes.

Yeah? Hey, fuck you.

If I didnâ€™t know better,
Iâ€™d say you were dodging court-martial.

Canâ€™t wait to hear what the guys are gonna
say when I tell them who I bumped into.

Iâ€™m sure someone would love
to come pay you a visit.

No, you know what? Iâ€™m sorry.

Wow.

Why donâ€™t you come back
and have a drink with me?

Old times.

You can see half of Osaka from here.

Not bad, huh?

Americans.

I still got a couple contacts.

Cheers.

Old timesâ€™ sake.

Old timesâ€™ sake.

Listen.

I know youâ€™re not in the army anymore,

and I can see you got
a good thing going here.

Man, I always liked you.

Donâ€™t worry. Okay?
Your secretâ€™s safe with me.

Thank you. I appreciate that.

All right.

Jesus, man.

I meanâ€¦

Yeah.

You like whiskey?

Yeah.

I have got a surprise for you.

Do your best.

-Iâ€™m sorry.
-What?

[gasps, gurgles]



Miyu?

-Are you okay? Hey.
-[whimpers]

-Hey.
-Justâ€¦

Who did this to you?

-Just go.
-Who did this to you?

Thereâ€™s a baby in me.

Thereâ€™s a baby in me.

Itâ€™s ours.

Who hurt you?

[in Japanese]
It doesnâ€™t matter who did this to me.

Just leave it.

Maybe you want to protect meâ€¦

but I donâ€™t want that.

Do you get it?

Iâ€™ve been fine my whole life.

Iâ€™m fine with it.


Whoâ€™s there?

Whoâ€™s there?

Nick.

I betrayed you.

Sheâ€™s gonna have a kid.

You want me to leave? Iâ€™ll leave.

You say the word.

You leave my sisterâ€¦

with your child?

Is that who you are?

I donâ€™t know.

Get inside.

[in Japanese] Hang on.

[in English] You know what these are?

They were my fatherâ€™s.

He left our home when I was young.

My sister was a baby.

The day he left, he was drunk,

and he came to me in the night with these.

And he said,

â€œThis is <i>daisho</i>.

One for war, one for honor.

One to kill, one to decapitate.

One for murder, one for suicide.â€

<i>Katana</i> and <i>wakizashi</i>.

This never left a warriorâ€™s side,
even in his sleep.

It was his honor.

My father told me the <i>daisho</i> was mine now.

Because I was the one
with a family to look after. My sister.

Sheâ€™s yours to protect now.

You understand?

If you are my brother, take them.

What?

Thereâ€™s just one other thing.

What is it?


That will do.

Okay.

[Kiyoshi grunts]

-Thank you.
-Youâ€™re welcome, brother.

Thanks to you, Iâ€™m now in a conflict
with my fatherâ€™s childhood friend.

Do you know what the other families think?

Does it look like Iâ€™m in control?

Hey. Iâ€™m talking to you. Look at me.

The Shiromatsu family is broken.
They pose no threat.

Trust me.

You donâ€™t need to get your hands dirty.



Iâ€™m all yours.


Itâ€™s a beautiful day.

Beautiful day.


-[gunshot]
-[Akihiro gasping]


[in Japanese] Get in, Nick.

Whatâ€™s going on? Where is Orochi?

What the hell?

We will circle the streets
until we find them.

Please duck down.

Fuck.


[tires squealing]

Kiyoshi.

Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi.

-No. Oh, jeez.
-[moaning]

[in Japanese] Brother.

[in English] Itâ€™s okay.

Itâ€™s okay.


Ryuhei, Taro, Ichiro,

Kazuo, Yuta, Eiichi.

That car was full of Seizu,
not our people.


You canâ€™t be sure.

A fifth of our men have betrayed us.

We cannot go to war with Seizu.

We cannot win this!

[in Japanese] It doesnâ€™t matter who wins.

You should care who wins.

They will send the killers into hiding
in Kyoto, Nara, Tokyo.

Now is not the time.

Thenâ€¦

when is the time?

This is for your sake too.
Donâ€™t you get it?

Is this war?

Is this war?

Is this war?

Nick.

Miyu is outside. You should go to her.

[no audible dialogue]



You like this kind of thing, right?


You fucking <i>gaijin</i>.

Thatâ€™s right.



-I have a message from the Seizu's boss.
-[grunts]

Please come tomorrow to the port factory,
which is neutral territory,

with no guns.

He said he wants to end the war.

He sent you here to tell me this?

Yes.

Thank you.

You can leave now.

He told me to bring back your response.

Right now?

Yes.

Understood.

I will meet him.


I know you are here!

Get out here now
and show me your dirty face.

What are you doing?

Iâ€™m here!

Here!


A tough one.

Iâ€™ll give you that.

You killed many of my most important men.

What do you want?

I donâ€™t want anything from you.

But I have someone here who might.

Orochi.

You are my son.

Itâ€™s not too late.

Come back.

I wanted to.

[all shouting]

My son.

The Shiromatsu family no longer exists.

The head of the Seizu is a generous man.

He wants all of you to live.

[in English] For youâ€¦

I can offer you peace if you leave Osaka
and your woman behind.

We make no promises for her safety
if you stay.

[in Japanese] Do you accept?

[in English] Youâ€™re all idiots.


-Fight me.
-Takeshi.

Fight me.

Fight me!

Orochi!


[winces, groans]

[Nick shouts]

-Get out!
-[crowd murmuring]

[officer yelling]

What--

Shh.

Akihiro.

Heâ€™s dead. Heâ€™s gone.

Orochi, he killed him.

Now, you pack a bag and we go together.

Yes?

-Yes.
-Okay.

Now get your things, and we leave.

Now. Now.

[phone ringing]

[ringing continues]

Hello?

Nick.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yes, of course.


-You!
-[shouting]

[all yelling, grunting]



[in English] What do you want?

[in English] I want you to allow meâ€¦

to kill him.

Give this warrior a weapon

and let him show us
how strong and brave he really is.

What do you have to fear...

[in Japanese] brother?

[in English] You walk into my home.

You take my brother,
you poison my fatherâ€™s mind.

Poison him against me.

Someone has to put out the fire.

You think you are a <i>yakuza</i> with this?

You arenâ€™t a <i>yakuza</i>.

You are a <i>gaijin</i>. Outsider.

You are just the way my brother found you.

Get up.

Get up!

No. I wonâ€™t fight you.


[in Japanese] Donâ€™t shoot!



[Hiromitsu in English] Go now. Go.
