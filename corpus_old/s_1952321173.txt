Falllng ln love ls beautlful

We do it forone reason: nothlng
ln the world makes us feel so good

-Don't!
-''Don't!''

-That hurts!
-Poor Kate Let me make it better

You're ugly You're ugly!

Flrst love ls the most powerful
because no one's been hurt yet

My flrst love was Bobby Norton

Everythlng he dld
had a sort of maglc to it

The way he smlled, talked

the way he walked llke my
favorite actor,Bllly Jack

Bobby was a movle star

You okay?

Maybe you shouldn't
shove so hard the next time

My heart just got bigger

When l do like this it looks like
you only have one eye

Thank you

One of the dlfferences between men
and women when it comes to love

ls the need to tell the world
every little detall

lf you choose to splll your guts
to someone

just make sure
it lsn't Becky Sussman

Bobby, are you okay?

-How could you do it?
-What did l do?

You told everybody
How could you do that?

All my friends are making fun of me
And now it 's over

lt 's over!

Bobby!

l'll tell you friends l was lying!

l'll let you hit me harder!
Bobby!

Love ls a mlnefleld We take
a step,get blown to pleces

put yourself back together agaln
and stupldly take anotherstep

l guess that's human nature

It hurts so much to be alone that
we'd rather blow up than be slngle

Hey, Frank

That doesn't make the elevator
go any faster, Kate

l know, but it makes me feel
more involved

-Are you angry?
-No Why?

l just heard single women

tend to be 8 times angrier
than married women

Maybe you should write an article
about it, since you're not married

l would, but

l'm writing about married bald guys
who can't get hard without Viagra

-You're late
-l know

-Not a good day to be late
-Why not?

Because the Anti-Christ
is really pissed at you

She wants to see you
in her office right now

-God Why?
-l'm not supposed to say

-Do you have any stretch marks?
-Not yet

Damn! l have a deadline
on my Vitamin E piece

That bitch in accounting won't talk
Anybody here have stretch marks?

Sit down

God!

Don't get old, Kate
Old is ugly, ugly is death

-You're fired
-What?

Get me Leo Was this a joke? Were
you planning to turn in this thing?

You said l should make
the article my own, so l did

Kate, this is a step-by-step
description of sucking cock

-Yeah, l called it ''Blow by Blow''
-Very clever

''When life sucks, so should you
Oral sex can cure depression''

What the fuck were you thinking?

Maybe the title is a little harsh
But l found a great hook, no?

l meant you should draw from your
own experiences and relationships

That 's what l did

l know ten times more about blow
jobs than l do about relationships

l failed at every relationship
l've ever been in

l don't know about your personal
life, and l don't give a shit

The point is,
our readers still have hope

This is called Monique Magazine
My name is at stake here

lt is not called ''Tired Old
Jaded Dicksucker Review''

What if Mary writes the piece
on perfect relationships

and l do the thing on stretch marks?
l know tons of people with them

l'm gonna be completely
honest with you

l can't cope with being fired

This is the only thing in my
entire life l haven't failed at

l can do the assignment,
l know l can

Can you finish 2,5OO happy,
perky words by deadline tonight?

-Absolutely
-Then you are temporarily unfired

Now get the fuck out of here

Shit! Shit!

So were you fired?

Not yet

Somebody made a copy
of your article and circulated it

Pretty good

So you use your hands?

Happy, perky notes

on how to find and keep
that perfect man

We allwant to be loved

It doesn't matter by whom,as long
as they make us feel less alone

What makes a relatlonshlp
last forever?

lf l knew the answer,lwouldn't
be llvlng alone with my fourcats

They say you have to klss
a lot of frogs to get to the prlnce

Rlchard MlItnerwas the most
borlng frog l ever dated

But sometlmes you just
have to get out of the house

You know,
masculine and feminine

We lucked out pretty good

My mother's corns
aren't usually this bad

Lucky for us she wasn't able to walk
well enough to come to the show

lt 's haunting, don't you think?

What?

The paintings
They're pretty disturbing

-You think?
-lf l had a kid

l definitely wouldn't put
one of these up his bedroom

Unless l hated him

My father would've hung
stuff like that from my ceilings

He hated me
My mother hated me too

She used to tell me l was dying
of cancer when l was four

lt always sent me in depressions,
which is exactly what she wanted

because then l wouldn't ask her
to make me lunch

She hated it when l bugged her
for food or stuff

-Would you like a champagne?
-What?

A champagne, would you like one?

Yeah, absolutely

Are you looking for me?

l wasn't really looking for anyone

Do you mind if l talk to you
for a minute?

Sure

ln the corner

-ln the corner?
-l don't like the middle of rooms

Just come with me to the corner
No one's behind you in the corner

-Who's the guy you're with?
-What guy?

Richard? He's a stand-up comedian

He seems funny
ls he your boyfriend?

Richard? No He's 3O years old
and lives with his mother

So what do you think
of the paintings?

l love the style, but l think
they're a little immature

lmmature? What makes you say that?

Look at that one over there

-What the hell does it mean?
-That?

That means there's a woman pulling
a severed head out of her ass

What 's the point?
What do l learn from it?

Maybe that 's it There's no point
You don't have to learn anything

l wonder what the artist looks like

He must be scary to make this shit

Maybe he has a highly developed
dark side you don't understand

So how long did it take you
to paint that one?

Gosh, there you are
l've been looking all over for you

You are a doll
Look at this! Thank you

Richard, Adam Levy

-You're the artist
-You're the lucky guy

We were just getting around
to discussing our future children

Right, but l don't think you're
gonna have a future together

-l'm sorry Excuse me?
-You'd need to see the person again

You're not gonna be seeing her
anymore 'cause she's my girlfriend

-What?
-What?

When we laid eyes on each other

we had this spark Right?

-Kate
-lsn't that right, Kate?

No, actually

ls this some kind of joke?

No, but this is:
two guys walk into a bar

One guy is a 3O-year-old stand-up
comedian who lives with his mother

Could we go now, please?

You know, it is women like you
who turn men into weirdoes

Don't bother Once l've been hurt,
there's no turning back

That wasn't cool l made it weird

-You shouldn't have done that
-l know

So where should we eat?

You are without a doubt the tallest
woman l've ever met in my life

Really?

l've been noticing you have
these

long ET fingers

Like a tree frog

My God! How big?

-Size 11
-Size 11?

-Yeah, size 11
-Woman's size 11?

ls this some kind of artist thing?
Focusing on people's flaws?

l don't see them as flaws,
but as God's artistic choices

l guess God decided to give you
this abnormally large head

You know what 's different?
You're being shitty and mean

And l was celebrating
your body, who you are

-You were celebrating my body?
-l was

-l like this part normally
-What part is that?

When it 's new, you know
You can ask all the fun questions

-Right
-Let me first

What 's you relationship like
with your dad?

My dad's dead

He was hit by a car in front of me
when l was six

God l'm so sorry

Just kidding We get along great

-Any brothers and sisters?
-lt 's my turn

l took your turn away
Any brothers or sisters?

Three older brothers How many
women have you slept with?

-Excuse me?
-l know you've counted How many?

-How many men have you slept with?
-Not that many 13

13?

As like 13 different guys?

Spread out over the years,
that 's not so many

Aren't you gonna
answer the question?

2 Okay?

-2? That 's it?
-That 's it

Some of us actually believe
in having full relationships

l believe in relationships
Mine just happen to be short ones

l'm sorry you're like a whore

-Excuse me?
-13! Jesus Christ!

Give me a break!

-Were you popular in high school?
-What do you think?

-l guess that 's a no
-l don't need this shit

l was very popular in high school

l was an artist, l used to draw all
the pretty girls, made them better

They all loved me

They didn't sleep with me,
but they loved me

How about you?

You must 've been
real popular with that attitude

No, l had huge buck teeth
and bony knees

And l slouched to hide the fact
l hadn't grown any boobs yet

And my hair was all stringy
and everybody called me Horseface

Horseface? lt suits you

-You think so?
-l like it

-You like it?
-What was your longest kiss?

The longest kiss?

Don't, it 'll just make me jealous

Just make sure this one's longer

Adam was unllke
any guy I'd ever know

We were lnstant best frlends

Two people who understood each
other without havlng to say a word

It wasn't llke that at all
ln my flrst relatlonshlp

lwas a bad ldea to glve up my
vlrglnity to my French teacher

lf two people want to be
a couple of them

it is good when they are making love
with each other, they feel nice

-What?
-Let 's make love

We will, Mr Bossard
l promise

l don't think l can tonight though
l'm not really ready yet

Because you feel we don't have
the quality of life together

-l am sad for this
-What?

Let 's make love, cheri, please
l am waiting for so long

-Will it hurt?
-Do not be scary

-l am there for you needing me
-What?

Mr Bossard

are you doing it?

l can't believe it lt 's supposed to hurt

Maybe it 's because l've ridden
horses all my life

Are you smaller than most guys?

My older man daddy phase
contlnued on rlght lnto college

lwas not a very evolved person
by the tlme l ran lnto Erlc

-Are you okay?
-Are you blind? Out of your mind?

What is wrong with you?
This is a brand new car!

You could've killed me!
What are you doing?

-l said l'm sorry, alright?
-This is a US$ 5OO shirt!

-l didn't see you
-You didn't see me?

-Were you painting you toenails?
-Listen, fuckface! l didn't see you!

l didn't wake up this morning
and go

''Today is the day l'm gonna crash
into some fucking uptight yuppie!''

You know what, lady? Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Shit! Fuck!

-There! You see that?
-How's that?

-Take that!
-Okay, break it up!

-Officer, l
-Shut up! Hands behind your back!

-Hit him with your big stick!
-You! Get up there!

-We got off on the wrong foot
-What?

You just destroyed my car!

l'm sorry about that
Maybe we could start over again

You got any plans for dinner
tonight after we make bail?

So this is where writers hang out?

What do you write about?

l'm working on a novel between
my journalism classes at UCLA

A novel?

-What 's it about?
-Death

That sounds interesting

So what do you do?

l work a lot with
Big Red-Ass Monkeys

lt 's a band You know, the band?

''Big Red-Ass Monkeys are here''
l direct music videos

lsn't that the one where the naked
girl swims with a chimp?

Ape Great ape

Right l guess chimps don't have
those big red asses

l don't know, l never checked

Do you think
maybe l could kiss you?

-Maybe later
-Maybe later when?

Maybe later like 5 seconds

5, 4, 3, 2

l hate when that happens

A toast to our
three-week anniversary

l think this is the longest
relationship l've ever been in

Well, not counting Mr Bossard,
which lasted one semester

-Did l ever tell you?
-Don't mention your French teacher

lt really disturbs me

-Good
-And your last relationship?

-God What about it?
-How long was it again?

-Five miserable years
-What did you have in common?

Nothing

What do we have in common?

-We have a lot in common
-Like what?

Like, how many people do you know

who have sex in public places?

Every guy l've ever met

Good morning You know
what day today is, don't you?

Sunday morning My turn

-l thought it was my turn
-Nope lt 's my turn

You know what?
This game is idiotic

-lt 's not spontaneous
-That 's not true

Scheduled spontaneity is the key
to long-term love

Don't look so happy

l like Sundays

Careful, careful

l'm not getting that

They can wait Come on

-Get it or you're not getting it
-l can't get it

Alright

l'll be back

Don't lose your
concentration, okay?

Where you going?

Now you want some, don't you?
Hold that thought, okay?

Daddy!

-Guess what l did at Kiddieland?
-We're gonna go Come with Mommy

lt 's not what it looks like,
l'll explain Nell, wait! Nell!

Kate, l can explain!

Will you come back?

Will you stop? Stop!

-What are you?
-l understand how you feel

You have no idea how anyone feels
You're a social climber!

-l'm planning on getting a divorce
-Don't ever touch me again!

-Kate!
-Daddy!

Even when bad relatlonshlps end

the paln can be severe enough
to screw you up foryears

We all plck up a little baggage
afterevery breakup

The hope ls that when the bags
start to accumulate

we're stlll able to drag them
lnto the next relatlonshlp

Fortunately when Adam and l
moved ln together

my carry-on baggage
was falrly llght

-Let 's put that one in the bedroom
-l was gonna put ''Paul's Entrails''

lt 's better for the bathroom

lf you want to be obvious

Okay, whatever you want

-l love you, Horseface
-l love you too

l mean l love you more than
l've ever loved anybody ever

in my life

Where are you going?

God

-Say it
-Why do you want me to say it again?

Because it was cute And l want
that cute moment saved forever

lt 's gonna sound forced
And l'm irritated Could we just?

-Just say it
-l love you

-Horseface!
-l love you, Horseface

l love you too Now strip

-Strip?
-Strip

-Put the toy away and we'll
-Come on

-Don't poke the bear in the zoo
-Come on

-Don't poke the bear in the zoo
-Take it off Come on

-Don't poke the bear in the zoo
-Whip it out

When you flnally share your lonely
bed with the one you love

llfe just doesn't get any better

-That was not me
-Stop Stop it

That was the first time you
That was your first fart

That was your first fart
You do love me

Don't blame it on me

That was so cute
You're embarrassed

Come here No woman has ever
farted in front of me before

Hi

-Hi
-What?

-What?
-Why are you smiling like that?

lt 's our one-year anniversary
You should be smiling too

l guess so

Come here Come on

No, come here
Are you a grouchy little bunny?

l'm taking you to some place
very special today

-Where?
-lt 's a surprise

Go fill me the tub
and l'll take you

-Now, in the middle of the day?
-l feel very dirty l need a tub

Forget it

Can you just fill me a tub?
Come on, you big grouch, just go

My God, it 's like pulling teeth
with you to get anything

My God!

Are you insane? What are we
gonna do with all these kittens?

l don't know
Make stew, l figured

What are they doing in there?
They like you, obviously

This one's Louie,
this one's Murray

This is Steve and
this is Mordecai

l got them from
the Chinese restaurant

Hi, Mommy

Hello Aren't l cute?

Hi You are my new mommy now

Bet the other 13 guys you slept with
didn't get you a litter of kitties

l'm pregnant

-You're really?
-l took a test and it turned pink

Pink? lsn't it supposed
to be like a plus sign?

Believe me, l know how to pee
on a stick and read directions

-l thought we were being safe
-Yeah, not safe enough

-God, we hardly know each other
-We know each other

l just don't know if l'm ready
to be a mother, Adam

l'm too confused, too immature,
too messy

What about abortion? Did you ever
think about that

possibility?

l just never thought this
would happen to me

-l don't know what to do
-Here, come here

Don't worry A lot of people think
it 's the world's greatest present

-What do you think?
-l'll tell you what l think:

that our baby would be the cutest
thing walking in poo-poo pants

Are you scared?

Of what? Of doing the most
natural thing in the world?

Of bringing a gorgeous little
brilliant genius into the world?

No l wouldn't be scared

What if it wasn't a gorgeous genius?
What if it was an ugly little troll?

l guess we just have to pray to God

that the baby takes after me

We could name it Ned,
after my grandfather

-What if it 's a little girl?
-Nedina, we'll call it

This one needs to be changed l want
you to practice to be a good mommy

God, my stomach is huge!

l look like Buddha

You're the same as always

So l've always had a Buddha gut?

Calm down You've been pregnant
a month The baby's too small

-Soon you'll look like a Volkswagen
-You have an abnormally large head

Come on, Horseface, get over here

Come on

Let 's see what we got here

Ned wants a womb with a view

Ned's not very funny

Well, Ned's just a fetus
We should cut Ned a little slack

And l think you're
more beautiful than ever

Are you okay, baby?

Are you okay?
What 's wrong?

l'm bleeding

Something's wrong

Something is going wrong

Get up Get up

Where's your robe, baby?

-Where's your robe?
-l don't know

Do you think it 's possible
to love the same person forever?

-Sure Don't you?
-l don't know

l haven't seen a relationship that
didn't end one way or another

What about your parents?
They've been together for 35 years

They live together, but they haven't
said ''l love you'' for 2O years

Maybe that 's human nature You spend
that much time around a person

saying ''l love you'' is probably like
saying ''cheese sandwich''

God, l hope not

Katie

-l cheese sandwich you
-l cheese sandwich you too

The longeryou're with someone,
the more annoylng they'll become

You'll become annoylng too So lf
you want perfectlon all the tlme

don't bother havlng
a relatlonshlp

Did you see that little old lady?

-Didn't she look sad and lonely?
-l didn't look l need some shoes

Her eyes were so hollow

Old people have hollow eyes
Especially old women

-What?
-Can we go in here?

What do you mean,
especially old women?

-Women don't age as well as men
-How could you say that?

How many 5O-year-old women
do you see with 2O-year-old guys?

That 's a societal double standard
lt 's got nothing to do with facts

Who looks better,
Sean Connery or Shelley Winters?

lt 's nature Men have thicker skin
That 's why women wrinkle more

-Shut up
-You're afraid to become obsolete

At a certain age men start to notice
younger girls lt freaks you out

Well, you're going bald!

l have the keys!
Where are you going?

l've got one What do you have?

This with topless female ninjas

Let 's just get one 'Cause
we'll forget to return them

and it will be 8OO dollars
for two movies

-And which one do you want?
-''Nosferatu''

You've seen it 5O times,
and every time you get depressed

l like being depressed lt makes
me feel deep and introspective

Wanna see what this is about?
Maybe you might like it

''Nasty naked ninjettes infiltrates
the mob and take over little ltaly

nunchacking their way to Mafia
Don Guido Mantucci''

That sounds incredible

Why do you have to do it?

You think l wanna go home
and snuggle

and read subtitles and
watch in black and white?

Can't we ever go to a goddamn
video store and not argue?

Not as long as you have
such shitty taste in movies

lt 's not true! How can you not
appreciate German Expressionism?

-l love German Expressionism
-Right

What l don't like is what you turn
into when you watch that movie

You get all fixated on death
''l'm gonna die, you're gonna die''

Fine You watch your stupid titty
movie, l'll watch my death movie

-You return yours, l'll return mine
-Fine

lt 's her birthday
One of these should be free

Romance

The most lmportant part of keeplng
a good relatlonshlp golng

Be sure to treasure each one of
those moments together ln bed

We haven't had sex in a while

We haven't had sex
in like three weeks

You're not even listening to me

No, l wasn't

l said we haven't had sex
in like three weeks

Maybe it 's because you clip
your toenails in our bed

What 's the real reason?

l don't know

Do you want to have sex right now?

No Do you?

No

-ls there something wrong with us?
-l don't know

Maybe we should force ourselves

-What? Like mutual rape?
-lt might turn us on

-l'm tired
-Me too

-Love you
-Love you too

Don't do that You don't know
how much that bugs me

l said don't!

lf you do that one more time,
l'm gonna scream

l think it 's over

What 's over?

Us l think we're done

What are you saying?

l think l need to break up

What did you just say?

l said l think we should break up

No You said you need to break up

-What 's the difference?
-There's a huge difference

Saying ''we'' implies it is mutual
Otherwise it means you're ending it

-Are you ending it?
-l don't know l guess so

Have you met someone else?

Nothing like that lt 's just we're
becoming this old married couple

God lt 's the 13 guys thing,
isn't it?

That 's what it is

You've been obsessed with my past,
now you want to make it even

Shut up about that
lt 's not the 13 guys

l'm over that, l've dealt with that
lt 's a non-issue, l promise you

Then why now?

lt 's that l've never been single

l've spent my whole life going
from one relationship to another

And l've never been alone

Do you realize what you're saying?
Do you realize what this means?

What does this mean?

lt means this is it, the end

And once it 's over, it 's over

Yeah, l guess so

But it 's not like
we won't still be friends

Who said anything
about being friends?

We love each other
l don't wanna lose you from my life

Know that when you get to number 13
l won't be here waiting for you

Give that up, it 's not about that
lt isn't working for either of us

-You're not happy, are you?
-No, l'm not happy

-So neither of us are happy
-You're right l'm miserable

Could you stop?
You're packing my laundry now

Breaking up would be
the best thing for me!

You know what?

-l feel good No, l feel great
-Come back to bed

Already it 's like a weight
has been lifted off my head

-Can't this wait?
-l can breathe, l can think

All of a sudden life is clear
lt 's amazing!

l am so happy!

When l look back
at the love l had with Adam

l see a pathetlc potted plant
nobody bothered to water

It started out green and lush, then
eventually became a drled up stlck

Breaklng up ls llke dylng,slowly

with nobody around

That's why ls so lmportant
durlng that dark perlod

to keep yourself busy dolng
the thlngs that don't depress you

Fuck me! Jesus! Kate!

l can't believe it

Our relationship hasn't even
started decomposing yet

-Who's this?
-My friend Kate

Kate, this is my friend
Peaches

This must be the friend
you just broke up with

And this must be the friend
you just started fucking!

Wait, wait

Peaches? My God!

What the fuck
is that thing on your face?

-Keep your voice down
-What are you doing here?

This is my movie! You came to make
out with someone called Peaches?

-How dare you?
-l wanna call you Can l call you?

No l'm gonna get over you
And when l do, l'll call you

That could take days

Okay, let 's see here

That 's hideous

Here you go Kate, how about this?

No That makes me look
like a drug addicted hooker

l wanna look great
Like a drug addicted model

l don't see what the big deal is
lt 's just a birthday party

Adam's gonna be there

-Aren't you over him yet?
-Of course l am

l just want him to feel jealous
when he sees me with Jerome Davis

Jerome Davis? Wait a minute

The perverted basketball player
who was obsessed with your ass?

He was?

You got a great ass
You're a big woman

but your ass is small and compact
to fit your size

And yet if you take that ass and
put it on your little friend here

it would be fucking huge

That 's it, l'm gone

God!

Thought it was you

l didn't expect to see you here
l didn't know Sam invited you

-No Mary invited me
-Mary? Of course

That 's great

lt 's nice to see you

l haven't seen you in a while
l've missed you

lt 's been a long time

-l'm sorry Hi, l'm Adam
-What 's up, Ad? Jerome

lt 's not Ad, it 's Adam
What 's up, Jer?

-Why don't l call you tomorrow?
-Don't make this a weird thing

-l'll give you a call tomorrow
-Give me a call

Give me a call or page me,
'cause my shit 's blowing up now

-Why don't you call me?
-l will

l'm running around a lot Star 82
so l now it 's you, l'm screening

-That was really weird last night
-l know, that was really weird

-So you're in love?
-l should be asking you that

-Why should you ask me that?
-You kept kissing that Lolita!

Come on, Michael Jordan
was sucking your tonsils out

Where did you find
that guy anyway?

-Let 's not get into that
-You're bringing it up

De Niro

Yeah He's a good actor

Good?

Good? l mean, we're talking
about Robert De Niro here

Good? Come on He's a

Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

De Niro, he's not

l mean, like ''Cape Fear''

Counselor

Come out,
come out wherever you are

l know you, you piece of shit!
l'm better than you all!

l can outlearn you,
l can outread you

l can outthink you

and l can outphilosophize you

That 's good, right?
And ''Raging Bull'', which is

the greatest performance
of all time

You're gonna get me down, Ray
You're gonna get me down

Are you alright?
l know the Heimlich

-You wanna ruin my relationship?
-Your nose is so cute

You never tried to get me back

-Can l kiss it?
-What?

-Your nose
-Stop screwing up my life

l'm involved with somebody else

Marry me? Please

-Are you listening to me?
-l get it, don't worry

l broke up with you
'cause l was inexperienced

You were my third girlfriend
How was l supposed to know better?

You had it so easy compared to me
l was your 14th You were my 3rd

-Look, you can't
-Just marry me

l'm sorry, l screwed up l can't
live with this kind of mistake

Don't you see?
This is really bad timing

You can't just wait until l'm
involved with somebody else

then suddenly propose marriage
or profess you love for me

l'll change How does that sound?
We're gonna make up a contract

everything you don't like about me
l'm gonna change

Death penalty You're against it,
l'm for it l'm against it now

We're gonna go do candlelight
vigils at the prison

-l don't want you to change
-You know what? l won't change

l'm enough l learned that from you
We're gonna fly, take trips

l'll go to therapy, l'll get over my
fear of planes and we'll travel

Adam, stop it
Stop it right now

Alright Let me just ask you then
Straight out, all kidding aside

Katie will you marry me?

No

l won't torture anymore then

lf you're happy,
l'm happy you're happy

l made you miserable and l'm sorry

-l just want you to know something
-What?

l can't be friends
l'm just too weak

-Adam
-l can't even be around you

You're here like this incredibly
juicy ham sandwich

that l wanna eat, and l can't
because my lips are sewn shut

-That 's a pretty analogy
-You know what l mean

Have a nice life

Don't say that You know
we'll see each other again

Yeah, right

ls lnfatuatlon love?
No But it feels llke it ls

All those chemlcals ln your braln
turn every word he says lnto poetry

Did l ever tell you what l used
to do with my little brother?

Whenever he did something wrong,
l'd put dog shit under his pillow

l'd say ''Jimmy, go put you head
under the pillow and count to 2O''

Half the time he'd get to 1O
before he realized what happened

That was pretty stupid

Jimmy? No

He's a lawyer now
He's the smartest of all of us

Now you remember me?

Relatlons based entlrely on sex
end the mlnute the sex gets borlng

So lf you want it to last
beyond borlng sex

You'd bettertry to connect
on a deeper level

l brought us some cheese sandwich

Thanks

Do you think people can stay
passionate about each other forever?

Yeah As long as they work
on the relationship

and don't get fat

l wonder

l'm not sure it 's natural l'd like
to think it 's possible though

l think that, over time, we'll come
to take each other for granted

And after the years
of staying together saying

''l love you'' is like saying
''cheese sandwich'', you know?

Do you know that Robert De Niro
is lactose intolerant?

Afterthe lnfatuatlon chemlcals
ln my braln stopped muItlplylng

l began to get over
my non-judgmental phase

Joey and lwere gonna have
a real conversatlon soon

l'm gonna die

-Are you listening to me?
-What?

l'm gonna die

When?

Someday

We're all gonna die
Watch the movie

Doesn't that bother you?

-l don't think about these things
-Why not?

Look, we're in the middle
of a movie

That 's when l think
about death the most

All these people staring into
the darkness freaks me out

-Don't you get that?
-No Okay? l don't get that

Why should l get that?
l don't wanna get that

That 's the problem
We are supposed to get each other

You don't get me, l don't get you

What? What the fuck
are you talking about?

You know what my problem is?
l'm a floater

l float through life like
a corpse on a river

bumping into rocks and logs
l don't choose my path

-Shut up!
-l just bump into stuff, like you

l bump into you in a porno shop,
Boom! l have sex with you

Boom! l'm in a relationship with
you l don't think, l just boom!

-Shut the fuck up!
-So that 's what l am to you?

l'm just some goddamn log
you bumped into in a porno store?

You're wearing sunglasses
in a movie theater

-They're subscription
-That 's prescription, you idiot!

Okay, Mrs Thesaurus l'm an idiot
You know, that 's it

Hasta la vista, baby Here is a man
who will no take it anymore

You're all gonna die
Think about it

You're all gonna die
And nobody will remember you

because they'll all be dead too!
Excuse me

Hl, thls ls Adam I'm not home,so
leave your message afterthe beep

Hl,Adam It's me

Adam,are you there?

l dldn't wanna call anybody else

Are you okay?

-What 's wrong, baby?
-We broke up

-God
-l broke upwith Joey

That 's horrible

-l'm such a failure
-You're not a failure

l am l am a relationship leper

Not true You have more relationship
potential than anybody l know

Fuck potential
Anyone can have potential

Are you kidding?
Your only problem is bad timing

Two people could be perfect, and if
the timing's wrong, it won't work

Bad timing is the reason that most
normal people end up single

Normal people?

Weirdoes are single because
they're weird

but people like us

we're single because
we're victims of bad timing

Since when did you have things
so figured out?

Since you fell in love and l've lain in
bed awake every night and wonder

if l'd ever find anybody
who l feel as normal with

No Bad timing, Adam

lf the timing's ever right,
you just let me know, okay?

How about now? You think?

Okay, that 's cool
Take as much time as you want

Love ls ecstasy and agony

freedom and lmprlsonment

longlng and lonellness

lt 's what keeps us together
when life tears us apart

So, when you find that perfect man,
hold on tight

And then call me so l can see
what he looks like and laugh

because he doesn't exist,
you sad, perky

little optimistic suckers

l quit
l couldn't do the assignment

l've always felt like a fraud here
Everything l wrote was crap

And l'm a total sellout,
l can't do it anymore

And honestly l'm sorry
if l've caused you any problems

Wait a minute
She's way too fat

Everything you've written here
has been bullshit?

-Nothing has had a grain of truth?
-Nothing

So your research on blow job
being able to cure depression

is completely made up

No, actually, that one was true

But it only works for the suckee

The sucker always stays depressed

l told you that

l'm here

Actually, could l ask you
a few questions if it 's okay?

Sure Go ahead

-Are you married?
-No

-Do you have any children around?
-No

Do you feel the need to have sex
with a lot of different women?

-No
-Are you a liar?

Yes

Just kidding

Good You've got a sense of humor

That was my next question
Can you listen?

l'm sorry, what?

-You see how l?
-l get it Just one more, l promise

Do you have a problem
with complicated women?

Great Let 's go

May l ask you one question?

Of course l'm sorry,
ask anything you want

Have you allowed Jesus Christ
into your heart?

-God!
-lf l could have one moment

-No Get out!
-May l?

-lf the next knock is the devil
-Go!

-Listen, have you allowed
-Go! Now!
