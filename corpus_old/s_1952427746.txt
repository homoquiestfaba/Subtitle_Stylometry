Oh my God!

Oh my God!

No! No!

Whoo. Sure is hot out tonight.

Hot.

Hotter than nine naked women
in a Volkswagen.

Stinking hot.

Hey, Jimmy.

Can we turn up the AC?
I'm about to fry out here.

It seems all right to me.

Cheapskate.

Than man wouldn't know air conditioning
if it was drop kicked up his ass.

He ain't never turned it on in here.

She going to be fine.

She's going to be all alone.

Starr, we talked about this.
You said you were ready.

I know.

It was talk.

This is real.

Hell yeah, it's real, baby.

We're halfway out of town,
the car is packed.

We can't go back now.

Stop.
What?

Stop!

We said we were going to film this.

We agreed.

The whole trip.

Come on, People love this shit.

Not now, Billy, please.

Fuck it.

Do you want to stay
in this shithole forever?

Not me.

I'm not going to end up
like my father...

...working my fingers to the bone in
a fucking mill for the rest of my life.

I'm getting out of here.

If we don't leave right now, we may
never have another chance.

I know.

Give me some love.

How's your mama doing, Erlene?

Oh, I don't go by Erlene anymore.
I changed it to Starr.

Two "R's".

Oh, well, tell her I said 'hey'.

Hey, Noreen.

Pretty hot for an old broad.

I'm thirty two.

Don't mind him.
He's an asshole.

What'd I say?

What?

Noreen, get to work!

Jimmy, I have been on my feet all day.
I'm tired.

You know what?

I'm gonna fire you.

Haven't you fired me enough this month?

I'm not kidding this time, Noreen.

Right.

And who are you going to get
to work in this dump, huh?

There's plenty of girls
who want to work here.

Jimmy you are full of bullshit
a Christmas turkey.

I'm not kidding you.

I am not kidding you.

Excuse me.

You have a pay phone inside here?
The one outside is busted.

Yeah, there's one in the back.

Yeah.

What's the matter?

I've got a headache.

Bad?

I'll be all right.

Hey, Noreen.

Can I get a piece of that lemon
meringue pie?

Yep.

Yeah, I know.
No, it was a tough call.

I had to do a bit of a tap dance on
this one, but I closed the sale.

Okay.

How's it going tonight?

Can't complain.

What can I get you?

A cup of coffee would be great.

I got to warn you.
It's pretty strong.

Really?

How strong?

You could pull a pistol in it.

Uh, sounds good.

I got a long drive.

The kitchen's about to close...

...so if you want to order something
you'd better do it now.

Oh, no.
Thanks.

How about a slice of pecan pie?

We make the best pecan pie
this side of the Mason Dixon Line.

That's a bold claim, young lady.

Can you back that up?

Well you can just ask anybody
in Silver Lake.

Since I don't know anybody
in Silver Lake...

I guess I'm just going to have to take
your word for it, huh.

You trustworthy?

I swear on a stack of bibles.

You know, maybe later.
Just-just coffee.

Suit yourself.

You're not from around here, are you.
You just passing through?

Yeah.

Where to?

Oh, I'm sorry.

Where are you headed to?

New York.

New York? Oh.
Yes.

You live there?

Brooklyn.

God, Brooklyn.

I have always wanted
to see New York City.

And you live there.
Oh, you are so lucky.

You obviously have never been
to Brooklyn.

No, I haven't been much of nowhere.

Well, you should go.

Oh, I wish I could.
But, I don't think

I'll be leaving Silver Lake
any time soon.

Sorry.
Oh, don't be.

It's not such a bad little town,
really.

It used to be this big vacation
spot, you know.

Lots of boating and swimming.

People came from miles
and miles around.

What happened?

The lake dried up a few years back.

Nothing but a great big hole
in the ground now.

Let me get this straight.

There's not actually a lake
in Silver Lake.

No.

Wow.

Wow.

You still have that pie.

Yes, we do.
I'm Noreen, by the way.

Oh, hey, Noreen.

John Dixon.

Nice to meet you, John.
You too.

Likewise.

So, hey, is there a restroom?

Oh, in the back, by the phones.
Okay.

Hey, you should flush it twice.
The handle gets stuck.

I'll keep that in mind.

And that's Lord of the Ball.

It's 101.
Your Hip Country WTKJ FM.

Next up, news headlines, including
a grizzly multiple homicide

in Union County.

Plus the start of the Lincoln County
Fair this weekend...

and a road widening for the proposed
shopping center on 501 has hit a snag.

But first, WTKJ news is sponsored by...

What's the matter?
Shh. Be quiet.

What's wrong?

Some murders over in Union County.

Murders?

Four murders are being investigated
by the Union County Sheriff's Department.

The execution style slayings occurred
in the town of Aberdeen.

The bodies of Tom Carter,
age forty four...

...his wife, Lucille, age forty one...

...and their two children, ages six
and nine...

...were discovered dead in their
home this evening.

Gosh.
Police Chief Ronny Gayle said

they were shot in the head...

...with a twenty two caliber weapon
after being tied up

and wrapped in plastic.

Authorities are on the lookout
for a male...

possibly driving a late model black
pickup truck in connection

with the murders.
In other... local news, Union...

Jesus Christ.

What the hell is the world
coming to?

It's crazy.

This shit is just crazy.

Suspect, black pickup truck should
be easy to pick up.

What kind of person kills a child?

A sick bastard, that's who.

Something's wrong.

Well, let's get back to work.

You okay?

There were some murders tonight.

Really?

Yeah. A whole family.

Wow.

A husband, wife, two little kids.

Did you know them?

No, no, I didn't,
but little kids, you know?

You have kids?

No, no, no.

The Lord didn't see it fit to
bless us with any.

It's probably for the best, though.

How about you?
Is there a Mrs. John?

There was.

She... she passed away
two years ago.

Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

She was... she was a good woman.

You know what?
I think I will have something to eat.

It gives me the heebie jeebies.

What's that?

There's some crazy lunatic out
there somewhere.

There ain't no lunatics out here.

How's Frank these days?

Oh, he's Frank.
Got a job yet?

Yeah, he's employed full time
by the television.

I'm sure he'll find something.

If he'd get off his butt.

You could kick his ass out.

I married him for better or worse.

This is just the worse part, I guess.

You could always leave him.

Yeah, where would I go?

What would I do?
I'm just some damn waitress.

I don't know.
You could always...

run away with me.

Now what would Bobbie Sue
have to say about that one?

Bobbie Sue.

She likes you better
than she likes me anyhow.

Speaking of which, I think I should
get home to the missus.

How much do I owe?

Uh, five ninety one.

Is that right?
Yeah, let me see.

Two twenty for the burgers,
seventy five cents for the fries...

A buck sixty five for the pies...

Ninety five cents for the ice tea...
That's five fifty five... plus tax.

Yeah, it's five ninety one.

Well damn, girl.

See you're not some dumb waitress.

Hell, you can count.

Oh great, I can count.

Well, you know that
and a nickel can get...

me a cup of coffee.

Cheer up, Noreen,
it's gonna get better.

I guess it can't rain forever.

Sorry, Mister, the kitchen's closed.

Where's the nearest town?

Silver Lake.

But everything's probably closed
by now.

Silver Lake, huh.

What's after that?

Nothing but cows
and cornfields for hours.

Can I interest you in a piece of pie
or a cup of coffee?

I'll think about that
for a little while.

Can I get you something?

Yeah, get me a... get me a steak.

Kitchen's closed.
Can I interest you in some pie?

No.

We got the best pecan this side
of the Mason Dixon.

When the fuck did I ask you for pie?

Give me some coffee.

Sure thing.
Can you?

Hey! Hey!
We got a problem out there?

Evidentially you can't hear.
The lady said the kitchen's closed.

That means I'm not making squat
for anybody.

If you don't like it, there's the door!

Hey Noreen... sweetie...
I should get my change... and...

Meet me in the back.

What's that?

I'm just going to get some coffee
in the back.

Oh, uh... It's late, Hank.

I'm gonna hit the head
before I head out.

Hey. What's going on?

That man.

What man?

The one thatjust came in.
I've got a bad feeling about him.

Why?

Maybe that's him.

Him?

The one that killed that family.

Oh, Noreen.

He doesn't look like
the serial killer type to me.

I'm a police officer.

Just because you watch America's
Most Wanted every night,

don't make you an expert
on serial killers.

Whoa. Whoa.

Let's just stop right there.

For your information, America's Most...

Wanted plays a... critical part
in the apprehension

of many fugitives in this country.

It's important.

Lonnie...

Noreen, you're justjumpy, that's all.
I am not.

Look, even if he was the killer,
which clearly he is not...

He wouldn't stop in here for a
cup of coffee.

If he had a lick of sense,
he'd be a million miles away...

and he certainly wouldn't be
in this county.

All right.
And what if you're wrong?

I can'tjust go question a man
because you think he's weird.

You're the cop.
Go talk to him.

Talk to who?

Oh my God, you scared the
shit out of me!

Jees.
We was... we was just talking.

What can I get for you?

Some more coffee.

Yeah, sure.

He just wanted more coffee, see?

He wanted more coffee, that's all.

Sorry.

You okay?

You look like you saw a ghost.

Hey.

You all right?

That guy's got her spooked.

Maybe you ought to go say something.

Who?

Me?

You're the one with the badge.
Go do yourjob.

Excuse me.

Pardon me, mister.

It's probably none of my business,

but I was just wondering
what brings you here?

Here?

Oh, just our little slice of heaven here.
What brings you out this way?

It's none of your business.

Oh, well
we're a little friendly around here.

We just...

We like to get to know strangers.
I just want to know, that's all.

Is that a fact.

Yeah.

I just want to be left alone.

Well I can appreciate that.
I can appreciate that.

Where are you heading?

That's none of your fucking business.

May I remind you that you're a
talking to an officer of the law.

When you're asked some questions,
I'd like your name, sir.

Is that what you are,
an officer of the law?

That's right.
You want to just take it

down a notch, friend?

I'm just asking you a few questions.

You're more like a deputy, aren't you?

I am in fact a deputy.

Now listen.

I'm just here to ask you
a few questions.

That's all.
I'm not here to start any trouble.

Are you looking for trouble?

'Cause if you're looking for trouble,
I'm here.

I'm just looking to be left alone,
like I told you.

I'll leave you alone as soon as you
answer a few questions.

Fuck you.

God damn this!

I've had just about enough of
your mouth.

All right, you walk in here using
that kind of language,

I won't tolerate it.

Now, I need you to answer
some questions.

This conversation is over.

This conversation is not over.

God damn it, I'm an officer of the law,
you will tell me what I want to know!

Hi, mister... I'm talking to you!

Oh yeah?

How's this?
This might get your attention.

How's that? Huh?

Now you tell me right now what
you're driving.

Are you going to shoot me, officer?

I know what to do with this.
You don't worry about that.

You just answer my questions.

You know if you take that thing out,
you better be ready to use it.

I don't want to have
to ask you again, buddy.

You answer my questions right now.

Mister!

God damn it.
How's that, huh?

Lonnie.

How's that?

Lonnie.

Did I get your attention now,
huh, tough guy?

Did I get your attention now?
Take another step.

You tell me what you drive.

You tell me what kind
of car you're driving!

I'm driving a truck.

A truck. A truck.

They said it was a black truck.

I know. I know.

What color is your truck?

It's right out there.

Why don't you step
outside and see for yourself?

It's dark.

I mean, it looks black from here.

It's red.

Would you help me out here, Hank?
Huh?

All right.

It's red, so you say.

We'll see about that.

This is awesome.

It's red.

Red?

You sure?

Well, I'm no Martha Stewart,
but I'm pretty sure...

I can still tell the difference
between red and black.

The truck's red.

It's red.

It's red.

I'm sorry, mister.

I'm real sorry.
I mean...

This has been
a real bad misunderstanding.

You see, we're looking for a fella
in a truck.

It was... There was a police report
on the radio.

They're looking for a man in a
black truck.

What did this man in a black
truck do anyway?

He killed some folks.

Oh my gosh.

Well, I think that's about enough
excitement for one night.

Check, please.
Yeah.

I'll be right back.

I should come by here more often.

I didn't know you guys had late
night entertainment.

Are you okay?

Yeah?
I'm still shaking.

It's going to be okay.

I don't think he'll be coming back
here any time soon.

Oh my god!

Please.

Sit down.

Come here.

I want everybody's keys.

Your wallets, your cell phones...

Put them on the table
right over there.

Everybody.
Right now.

You... Bring them over here.
What?

Me?

Yeah.

Everything.

Pick it up and
bring it over here.

Take everything out
and put it right here.

Is that it?

You sure that's it?

Okay. Go back and sit down.

Hey!

Oh my god.

Are we having a problem over there?

Jesus.

I said.
Are we having a problem over there?

No. No problem.

Then sit the fuck down.

I thought you said you
gave me everything.

Don't fuck with me, honey.

Yes, sir.

Go back and sit down.

Hey.

Jack in the box.

Why don't you just walk on
over here right now?

That guy on the floor over there?

You drag him out.

Get it out where?

Wherever you want him.

Just do it.

You're crazy.
I ain't touching that thing.

Do what I say!

I'll put a fucking hole
in you right now.

I can't do this, mister.
I'm going to be sick.

Then be sick.

Drag him out, like I told you.

We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

It's going to be okay.
We're gonna die.

I'm so scared.
Shh.

Don't say anything.
Don't move.

Oh shit.

Do you think he's going to kill us?

I don't know.

I'm really scared.

That's okay.
Me too.

I wish we could do something.

Do you live close?

Yeah.

Your husband.

Is he going to miss you,
you know.

Call the cops?

No.

Look, I figure he's got maybe
eight bullets in that handgun.

Maybe seven shells in the shotgun.

How do you know that?

Lonnie carries a 1911.

Standard eight rounds.

Are you a gun expert?

Sort of.

What are you saying?

I say we rush him.

Are you crazy?

No, I ain't crazy.

There's five of us.
There's one of him.

Odds are he can't shoot us all.

Odds are he's going to shoot
some of us.

He's going to kill us anyway.

At least if we rush him,
we got us a chance.

We don't know what he wants.

Jesus Christ.

I won't sit around here
to wait to find out.

Are you with me?

Why not?

Look, I'm a salesman.
I'm not a superhero.

What do you suggest we do then?

Wait?

Wait for what?
To die?

Fuck that.

Will you shut that yakking over there!

Mister?

What?

I know you're scared.

Of what?

It's not too late.

Too late for what?

To stop all this before it gets worse.

Please.

Please.

You guys just sit over there
and play dumb.

Whoa.

Hey. Hey, it's me.
It's Greene.

You must be Mr. Smith.

You're the man with the gun.

Whoo. Boy hey...

Nash told me you were one cold
hearted son of a bitch, but my god...

I had no idea.

Hey, would you mind
not pointing that at me?

I... I don't like guns.

Hey!

Oh, okay.

Not the friendly type.

I get it.

You're working.

You're busy.
No problema.

Yeah. Well, since you're busy...

I'll get right down to business.
Is it done?

Is what done?

Yeah, the job.
Is it done?

What do you think?

Well, okay.

Then this, my friend, is all yours.

It's all there.

You can count it
if you don't believe me.

Yeah. So, I guess we're square.

Well, it's been nice doing business
with you...

...Mr. Smith and I doubt I'll need your
services anytime in the future.

But I will highly recommend you.

Oh, and I hate to overstate
the obvious, but uh...

these people have seen my face,

so you are going to
take care of them, right?

Oh yeah.

Okay.

Well, I would love to stick around
and watch you do your work...

but I got a date, so good night.

Hey!

Sit down.

Why?

Because I said so.

What for?

Sit down!

I don't understand where you're
coming from here, buddy.

Sit down!

Look, is this some kind of scam?
Is that it?

Are you wanting more money
out of me?

I got your money.

No, because I don't have
any more money.

See, I was told you were a lot
more professional than this.

Yeah, and I don't know what the hell
you got going on in here.

But you can damn well believe
that I'm calling Nash,

and I'm gonna tell her.

We got a big problem.

A problem?
What?

What problem?

I ain't Smith.

All right, so... you're... you're not Smith.

And, uh you're not a cop, either.

Well, there was a cop in his earlier,
but he's dead now.

'Cause I shot him.

Okay.

You must want something.

All right.
I mean, right? Am I right?

Everybody wants something, right?
Sure.

Okay. Okay.

We're getting somewhere.
We're getting somewhere.

So... what do you want?

The truth.

Okay. I'll tell you whatever
you want to hear.

Who is Smith?

Smith.
Yeah.

Smith. Smith. Yeah, he, uh...
I don't know.

You don't know,
or you're not going to tell me.

Which is it?

Could you just untie me?
Let me go.

I'll pay ya.

I already got your money!

I'll pay you more.

You said you didn't have any more!

Now you're nothing but a liar,
Mr. Greene.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm not.
I'm-I'm... I'll look-what do you do...

I'll tell you anything you
want to hear.

I'll tell you...
what you want to hear.

The money in the case.
Who's is it?

Where did it come from?

It was... that was a business deal.

A business deal, huh.
Yeah.

What kind of business deal?

I don't think I can do that.

I think you can.

I can't.

That's the wrong answer.

Oh, no. Come on! Come on,
let's talk about this.

Let's talk about it.

I'm ready, I swear.
I'll pay you, man.

You know, I'm good for it.

Oh my god.

I shouldn't be here.

I just should not be here.

This is not right!

The stupid convention.

I didn't want to go in the first place
and my boss makes me.

Really.

I should have driven straight
home the hundred miles.

But I had to stop in this particular
diner on this particular night.

Just dumb luck.

I'm going to die
in this god forsaken diner.

In the middle of nowhere.

For nothing!

Jesus!

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry.

Listen to me.

I'm sorry.

It's not your fault.

I've had bad luck my whole life.

For what it's worth,
I'm glad you did stop.

Who's Smith?

And where did that money come from?

I... I... I can't tell you.

Oh, I think you can.

Ask me how come I know it.

Say, "How do you know it?"

How do you know I'm going to tell
you the answer to the question.

'Cause I've seen it before.
Been there before.

Hundreds of times.

Sooner or later you're going
to say everything.

Everyone always does.

You got to ask yourself
a question though.

How much pain can you endure?

How much pain can you endure,
Mr. Greene?

I think you need a little bit
more incentive.

No! No! Okay!

Tell me what I want
to know now, damn it!

No, no, please.

No, I'll tell you!
Now say it!

Okay, I'll tell you,
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

Don't hold anything back.

Okay.
I'll tell you.

Okay.

What do you want me... to tell you?

Everything. Everything.

Uh, where do you want me to start?

Well, the beginning
is always a good place.

Try that.
Okay.

I... I... I'm a businessman.
This is all business right?

Yeah.
I own...

some family land over
in Anson County.

A couple of hundred acres.

We're building a shopping mall there.
I'm donating the land...

the land, my partners put up the money.

Pretty sweet deal you know.

It's perfect.
I could start printing the money... now.

I just needed to sell one
more piece of land.

One more big chunk of land right
where the parking lot needed to be.

But the owner,

he decided he didn't want to sell.

So I offered him double,
triple what it was worth.

He still said no.

He wanted to be a farmer.

You know, cows, chickens and shit.

I mean, who the hell wants to be
a farmer anymore?

Anyway... without that land,
I'm screwed.

The deal is stalled.

And I can't tell my partners,

'cause they'll kill me.

The guys are loan sharks.
They're screaming for money.

And when they get sick
of screaming for money,

they start asking for fingers... and toes.

Look, I'm just a businessman.
I made a business choice.

I had to do something fast,
so I called an associate.

He put me in touch with a name.

Mr. Smith.

Smith.

Who is this Smith anyway?

I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?

I don't know.

I don't even have a number.

He calls me.

What's he look like?

I don't know.

How the fuck should I know?

I talk to him on the phone.

This Smith.

What exactly is
he going to do for you?

He's going to persuade
the farmer to sell his land.

How's he going to do that?

I... I... don't know.
I don't know his operation.

You don't know?

What did he do to the farmer?

What-what does it matter anyway?

Nothing to me, buddy.
What did he do to the farmer?

He killed the farmer.

What else?

His wife.

Is that it?

His kids.

There's no heirs.

The land goes to the bank.
And I get a better deal.

That's the way hit went, huh?

Yeah.

You have no idea
what's going to happen to you next,

but you got it coming.

Wait!

What are you going to do?
Hey, what are you going to do?

No! please... please don't shoot...

What?

We got a big quandary here.

What are you talking about?

I'm talking about that bag of money
on the counter over there.

So what?
So what? That belongs to Smith.

What do you mean?

That means one of you is Smith.

One of us?

He got here before I did.
That means it's one of you.

You god dammed idiot.

Do I look like a professional
killer to you?

I don't know.
Maybe you are.

You fucking nutbag.

How about you?
You a killer?

Yeah, if you count the wildlife
I've run over with my car.

How can you be so sure?
Maybe he never showed up.

Nobody's going to leave a bag
of money like that behind okay?

Nobody.

How about these two?

How about you, college boy?

I'm no killer.

I'm an artist.

I ought to gun you first.

Why don't you decide for me?

I got a couple of maybes here.

Maybe?

Maybe.

Which one is the man.
Who's Smith?

Neither.

How do you know?

Hank's in here a couple
of times a month.

It can't be him.

A couple of times a month, huh.
And because of that you think

you know him that well.

Not that well, but he's not a killer.

How about him?

He isn't either.

What if I make you guess?

What if I give you
three seconds on the clock?

I can't.

Who is it?

I can't.
Three.

I can't!
Two.

Please.
One.

Oh my god.

Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

I'll talk.

I'll talk to you.

Hell, no.
He volunteered. Take him.

I don't care what he did.
I want to talk to you first.

Let's go.

I just want to go home.

I know. I know. Shh.

Okay. Okay.

It's going to be okay,
I promise.

Look.
What?

He made a mistake.
He didn't handcuff him.

So?

So he's getting sloppy.
I have an idea.

I have to get his gun.

How are you going to do that?

I got to get close to him.

I don't understand.

Look, you see what's going on, right?

He's going to kill that hillbilly
and he's going to put me

in that chair next.

What for?

So I need you to distract him.

Get him to turn his back,
just for a second. Okay?

How am I going to do that?

Okay. When I come get you,
I want you to scream

as loud as you can, okay?

Get him to turn his back.

Then I'm going to go for the gun.

Can you do that?

Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

Good.

You might as well hold your breath.
I ain't no killer.

Says you.

So how is this going to go?

I'm going to ask you questions.
And then you can answer me.

Questions about what?

Questions about you.

Ain't nothing special about me.

Everybody's special.

Each and every one of us
is a beautiful, unique snowflake.

That is the stupidest shit I ever heard.

You saying I'm stupid?

Are you saying I'm stupid?
Is that it?

No sir.

You're a soldier, aren't you?

I was.

You see any action?

Gulf War.

Desert Shield.

I was in the shit.

What were you?

Gun bunny.

Pretty good view of the action.

The action I saw was a bit different.

What was that, sir?

Well, you can say that I was kind
of a people person.

What about Iraq?

Did you make it over there?

Got out before that cluster.

Good for you.

What do you do now?

I drive a truck.

You married?

Yes sir.

How long?

Eleven years.

Eleven years married.

What's your wife's name?

Her name is Mabel.

Mabel.

What a sweet name.

She must be a good woman.

The best.

The best.

Do you love her?

What?

I say, do you love her, soldier boy?

Of course I love her.

You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

I told you I did.

You're a liar!

Look, Mister, I don't appreciate you
calling me a goddamned liar.

You ain't lying?

What's that?

What is that?

It's your wallet, right?

What are you doing with that in there?

Carrying around someone else's condom.
Is that it?

Does it belong to somebody else?
Is it yours or not?

Yes.

Well all right.

What do you do with that damn thing?

You having sex with other people
besides Mabel?

You got what you want.
Can I go now?

Hell no, you can't go.

Why?

I done told you
everything you want.

'Cause I'm not through with you yet!

I want to know who these people are.
That you've been having sex with.

Other than your wife of eleven years.

This shit ain't none of your business.

I'm making it my business.

I'm done talking.

Who is it?
Huh? Who is it?

I don't know.
I don't know.

You don't know
or you're not going to say.

Which is it?

I don't know their names.

There's more than one, huh?

Who are they?
Prostitutes?

Some.

Where do you meet them?

Truck stops.

Gas stations.
Bathrooms mostly.

You having sex with men?

Yeah. Yeah.
Why?

Because I like it!

Exciting, huh?

Yeah.
Better than with your wife, huh?

Yeah.

Are you Smith?

Look, I'll be anybody
you want me to be.

Just don't shoot me again.

Please don't shoot me again.

Are you Smith?

Yeah. Yes, I'm Smith.

You ain't Smith.
No!

You killed an innocent man.

That's the trouble with
aggressive interrogation methods.

Sometimes you only end up hearing
what you want instead of the truth.

He didn't deserve to die.

That's debatable.
He did serve a purpose.

As far as I'm concerned.

His purpose?
What was that?

Why are you doing this?

Is this some kind of game to you?
Playing with people's lives like this?

You got to separate the wheat
from the chaff.

What the hell does that mean?

I read it in a book somewhere.

For people who don't understand
the situation that they're in.

And what is my situation?

You're a good person.

You're just at the wrong place

at the wrong time, basically.

You could change it.

No, I can't.

You have the power to change it.

No. Can't do it.

You can.

Please do the right thing,
and just walk away, right now.

I've got a job.

It's a job I'm going to finish.

That's the way it is.

A job?

A job?

You call torturing
and killing people a job?

Why are you doing this?

What difference does it make?

It does.
It helps to know.

Listen.
If you want to know the truth,

I'm telling you honey.
I just came in here

to get something to eat.

Yeah.

Then what happened
all hell broke loose.

That's what happened.
That's the way it is.

What am I going to do now?
I can't turn back.

You, John.
Get up.

No.

Get up.
It's not him.

Get the fuck out of that booth.

Hey, it's okay.

Get up.

Over there.
Sit down.

Come on, get up.

Go ahead.

Stop right there.

I'm not taking any chances with you.

Baby.

I'm going to die.

Don't say that.

We're going to fucking die.

We're going to die.

Get up.

Are you Smith?

I am not Smith.

My name is Dixon.

Dixon.

Sure you are.

Listen.

I'm in sales.

Really, I'm in sales.

Sales.
Yeah.

I'm mean really, seriously.
Come on.

Do I look like a killer to you?

I mean, do I?

What makes you think I'm a killer?

Huh?

You're the only one left.
It ain't her, that's for sure.

Please. Please, I am not Smith.

If you're not Smith,
you're no good to me.

Please, Mister, stop!

Can't you see
he doesn't know anything!

Wait.

Sorry.

Are you Smith or not?

You know, I can tell you
I'm the Easter Bunny.

But it wouldn't mean shit.

But you're Smith.

Yes. I am Smith.

Now we're getting somewhere.
Yes we are.

You kill that whole family?

Yes.

Professional killer?
Independent contractor.

Who do you work for?

Not your business.

I can make it my business.
And I can make you tell me.

I don't think so.

I'm very good at my job.

I'm sure you are.

It doesn't matter.

I can tell you that.

Certainly by now you know
I'm trained to do this.

Yeah, you were
talking about it all night.

Ex-military, right.

Yeah.

You're an interrogator, right?
Yeah.

I know your type.

Professional.

Sadistic fuck.

Yeah.

And you work for the government, right?

It fucking figures.

Human resource exploitation.
Scored real high on that one.

Yeah. Sick mind for a sick job.

That's what the government said right
before they shit canned me.

They dumped you.

Personality disorders.

Said I was mentally unfit for service.

Fifteen years
of doing their dirty work.

And that brass just hung me out
to twist in the wind.

Too bad.

Had two fucking years in prison,
that's what happened to me.

No gold watches, pension plans.

Fuck all I got.

That's a fucking shame.

Sorry to disappoint you, you know.
But... still not going to tell you

what you want to know.

I can make you tell me anything
I want.

I'm very good at what I do.

You know what I think?

I think you'll get tired of trying.

Then you'll just kill me, so

let's just cut
the bullshit all right?

I'll tell you this.

People I work for?

Family.

Very powerful family.

With connections everywhere.

Kill me and you open up a whole
world of shit, my friend.

You and I... we're very much alike,
you know that?

No sir disappoint you again,
but you and I are nothing alike.

I kill for money.

It's a job.
Nothing more.

Nothing less.

You kill because, you know...
you're looney tunes.

Look, you're gonna kill me, right?

Let's just get on with it.

Really, I can't take much more
of this talking.

You're not afraid to die.

No. I'm not.

I am afraid you're gonna
keep talking, though.

What?
Something wrong?

If I take... If I don't kill you,
you'll take the money.

Then what's going to happen?

People are going to hunt me down
and kill me.

If I don't kill you,
I take the money

and you're going to come
after me, right?

Yeah.

That sounds about right.

You know what?

You could, you could
just give me the money.

And go.

And you'd forget all about me?

No.

But you'd have a big head start.

It's a big country.
I might never find you.

How about splitting the money.
Why don't we split it?

Honestly.
Yeah.

I'd still hunt you down and kill you.

Why not cut your losses
and take half the money,

and then you'll live to spend it.

'Cause I'd only be half happy.

But you'd have your health.

You know... I don't expect you
to understand this cause...

you know, you're a homicidal
lunatic...

But it's the principal of the thing.

I did a job.

I earned my money.

I expect to get paid.

All of it.

It's a tough choice.

Yeah, it's a pickle.
I do not envy you.

What would you do?
If you were me?

What? If I were in your position?
Yeah. What would you do?

I wouldn't be in your position.

Not that your position
is so much better.

I guess it's a matter of opinion.

Is that what you think?

You know what I'm thinking?

I'm going to tell you something.

Here's what I'm thinking.

I'm thinking you're
having a very bad day.

In what's probably a very bad life.

You walk in here
and get your ass handed to you

by Barney fucking Fife...

And then you know, you snap.
You start killing people.

Why?

I don't know.

I'm not a psychiatrist.

But, you're in too deep now.

You're in over your head.

You're screwed and you know it,
so you're thinking about the money.

Maybe I can take the money
and go to Mexico.

Leave all this behind me, you know.

Live on the beach, sip tequila shots,
and watch the sun set.

But the truth of the matter is,
your troubles are just beginning.

You can kill me.

But my people
are like a fucking Hydra.

You cut one head
& two more will pop up.

You will never stop running.

You will never hide.

They will find you.

And they will slowly
but surely kill you.

I mean, that's what I think.

I calls them likes I sees them.

I can't have you talking to the cops.

Or talking to your friends.

Kill everybody.

Nobody will know I was ever here.

I thought you called
yourself a professional.

You're a fucking amateur.

You okay?

Yeah.

Thank God.

I killed him.

You didn't have a choice.

Is he really dead?

Yeah.

I can't believe I killed him.

It was him or you.

It's okay.

Hey. These are starting to hurt.

You going to unlock them?
Keys are over there.

You got that key?

No.

What?

I can't.

You can't what?

I can't let you go.

Noreen.

I know who you are.

I'd never hurt you.

I promise.

You're going to kill me
the first chance you get.

All right.

Okay.

Okay, so don't help me.

What are you
going to do... turn me in?

Make a citizen's arrest?

Yes.

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Why not?

You think the cops can protect you?

You will never be safe.

Don't move.

I'm not going to jail.

Hold it! Right there!

What?
You're going to shoot me?

Don't make me.

I don't think you will.

Oh, I will.

I don't believe you.

And how do you know?

Mostly because of the way
you're holding that gun.

I will. I swear it.

I don't think you have it
in you, Noreen.

To intentionally kill another person?

A human being?

You're not the kind of person
who stands up for herself.

You know.

You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.

Well, I know enough about you.

I know you've been stuck
in this dead end marriage,

what... five or ten years...
and you don't have the guts to leave.

Shut up.

Right? And you've been working
in this god forsaken place...

for I don't know how long,
serving rednecks, making slave wages.

No job satisfaction.

Retirement?
And you still

don't have the guts to go, do you?

Shut up!

So no, I don't think you have
the guts to pull the trigger.

Stop.

I will shoot you

Put the gun down, Noreen.

Don't come any closer.

Put the gun down.

I will shoot!
Goddammit, put the gun down, Noreen!

Stop!

Stop.

Stop.

I mean it.

No, I mean it, really.

Shut up.

You know what?

I don't actually think you have
any bullets in that thing.

What?

I mean, I think you're holding
an empty gun.

No, I'm not.

Okay, let's see.

Let's think about it, okay?
You and me, we'll just think about it.

How many shots were fired?
Seven?

Eight?

Wow, I don't know...
in all the confusion,

I kind of lost count.

And I'm a professional.

You're just a fucking,
stupid waitress!

You know what?

You know what?

You're right.
I am just a stupid waitress.

I have a crappy, pathetic life.

I'm terrified of change.
I stay when I should go.

I'm not very smart.

And I'll probably
never be truly happy.

But I know one thing that you don't.

Oh yeah?

What's that?

I can count.

Huh?

One for the tall man.

Two for Hank.

Three for the kids.

One for the ceiling.

Seven bullets.

And there's one for you.
