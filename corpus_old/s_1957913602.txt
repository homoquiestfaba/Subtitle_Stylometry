<i>â™ª Just a little eggnog
and holly â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On this holiday with you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So hurry up
don't keep me waitin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm in the mood
for celebrating â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Just want a holiday for two â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As long as I'm with you
I don't care what we do â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Cozy fire or snowflakes
under the moon â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Grab some candy canes
we'll go ice fishin' â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª As long as we're together
we can only win â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you're around it's â™ª</i>

Jess, my wallflower.
What?

I am so glad that you're here.

I'm always exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

You, my dear, are not.

See those people there,
those are the ones

that buy the art.

Now go, mingle, be bright.

Sonja, you know
how I hate these things.

Oh, and I hate how my girdle
cuts off my circulation,

but we all must sacrifice
to get what we want.

Besides, I've already
teased everyone

about your first show
in two years. Oh...

You and your buzz.
Embrace the buzz, Jess.

That's the only way
my gallery can sell your art.

Thank you.

How's your progress going,
by the way?

<i>â™ª Marching band â™ª</i>

It's progressing.

work itself.

You must put in a few minutes
with him, okay?

Otto! Otto.
I'm coming.

so good to see you.

Your holiday soiree
is spectacular as always!

So happy you could make it.

Ah, I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

We're so excited for your new
work. I'm dying to get a taste.

Well, of course.
Give them something.

I'm sure you've settled
on a title by now.

Yeah, of course.
[Sonja] Mm-hmm.

Um, the title
was carefully chosen, uh,

to express
the duality of nature.

Poetic.
Winter.

Ah.
<i>- Winter: Light And Dark.</i>

Mm-hmm. Moody, I love.

Good, I'm so glad you like it.

[glass clinking]

Uh, I'd like to introduce
Jess Woods,

the most exciting voice in our
contemporary arts community.

The Young Collector's Council
has just acquired

one of her pieces
for the museum.

Greatness is among us.
Oh.

None of you may leave
without meeting with her.

This is Jess Woods.

Hi.
Jess Woods.

Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

This is Jess Woods.

Hi.
Jess, this is Elsy.

Hi, nice to meet you. Oh, okay.

[Otto] Jess Woods. Jess Woods.
Hi.

Hi.
Nice to meet you.

Yeah.
So, um...

you must meet Jess.


<i>â™ª Merry and bright â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It's Christmas time â™ª</i>

<i>the Stags take a 5-1 lead
over the Bulldogs.</i>

<i>But what's worse here, folks,
the Bulldogs are on the brink</i>

<i>of a longest losing streak
in team history.</i>

<i>no way to sugarcoat this, Tom.</i>

<i>This has simply been a brutal
stretch for the Bulldogs.</i>

Sheesh! I really thought
this was gonna be the year.

but we are Bulldogs fans.

And Bulldogs fans are relegated
to a life of pain and suffering

and almost and could-have-beens.

But what do we Bulldogs fans
always have?


Hope, Annie,
you gotta have hope.

Okay, you know what, Danny? I'm
freaking tired of hoping, okay?

The last time we made it
to the playoffs, I was sitting

in a high chair
and I was shoving cereal

up my nose and then eating it.

Wow, uh, image forever burned
in my mind, thank you.

<i>Now it's in the record books.</i>

<i>What turned out to be
a promising season for</i>

<i>the Bulldogs
has quickly collapsed</i>

<i>into the worst
losing streak in team history.</i>

Oh, man.
[indistinct chatter on TV]

One of these days, pop.
One of these days.

[instrumental music]

<i>â™ª You said I could drop it
to find the answers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I need to know â™ª</i>
â™ª Hey â™ª

<i>â™ª Been overthinking lately
I can't let go â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Searching for the answer â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Tryin' to find the answers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoo-hoo â™ª</i>

Oh, ho, ho.

I brought hot chocolate.
Come on!

And you interrupted
a serious flow I have going on.

Sorry, grumpy-pants.
No, I'm sorry.

Well, Sonja, in all of her
passive-aggressive glory,

laid into me how behind I am
on my show.

So it's going well.

I see the season has brought out
your bright and cheery side.

Hey, yeah,
somebody's gotta be a realist.

Everyone's walking around
all cheery

forgetting that on December 26th

all your anxiety
is just gonna be waiting

to slap you in the face.

Peppermint?
Hm.

What's in here?
Extra peppermint.

Oh, oh, oh. Ginger snaps. Okay.

What do you want?
Nothing.

I can't just be a good friend?

Like...
Hm?

Can you please come with
me to my company party?

Please? Open bar.

Jared's not going with you?
He is.

Hopefully, he doesn't get me
fired tonight.

I love you. I can't, no.

I have all this work to do.
Shoo.

Fine. Be prepared
for that 1 a. m. drunk-dial.

I'll be waiting for it.
I love you.

Thank you for the coffee.
Bye-bye.

[instrumental music]

It's good, it's good.

<i>â™ª Wade in to December â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When you're walking
in the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All the retail stores
are open â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With their windows
shining bright â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You can try
and shake the grin â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But it makes halos

<i>â™ª Ooh oh oh oh â™ª</i>

I can't.

<i>â™ª So I watch the snow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And hang some mistletoe â™ª</i>

Fine.

<i>â™ª Wait for a miracle â™ª</i>

Hi.

<i>â™ª Ooh oh-oh ooh oh-oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And so I watch the snow â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And hang some mistletoe â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Wait for a miracle â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Miracle â™ª</i>

[bell jingling]

[indistinct chatter]

Um, how much is it?

Keep you warm. Yeah, got it.
You getting a good haul?

Oh, here, here.
[Danny] All right, stay warm.

You, too.

[bell jingling]

[instrumental music]


You can just keep the change.
[driver] Thank you.

Uh, ah, thank you.
Happy holidays.


[bell jingling]

[music continues]

[indistinct chatter]

[pop song on stereo]

<i>â™ª You can give your heart
walking by â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh oh oh oh oh â™ª</i>

Yes, oh. Hey.
Hi.

What do you get
if Santa goes down the chimney

when the fire is lit?

Uh...
A crisp Kringle.

Crisp...

A crisp Kringle.
Uh, I apologize for that.

But, also, to be fair,
you probably should've known

not to sit on the one stool
everybody's obviously avoiding.

Hey, I like a good dad joke.

Oh, you're gonna love
this guy, then.

Old man's full of 'em.
Oh, is he your dad?

No. But he's still an old man.
My dad's dead.

Oh, God, uh...

I-I didn't mean to...
But before when you had...

You, you said, but, but...
Ah, it's okay, don't worry.

It was a long time ago.
I'm just messing with you.

Honestly, it was kind of fun
to watch you squirm.

Not very nice.

Ah. You look like him.

Yeah, Danny Carmody Senior,
the legend.

I-I inherited this bar
from him, actually.

And the gentleman
with the terrible

Santa joke is my Uncle Pat.

Oh, and from you
he inherited the sense of humor?

And she's sassy.
What can I get you?

How about a Pinot?

And sophisticated.

Be right back.
Thanks.

Hi.
Hi.

Oh.
Here you go.

And ginger snaps,
if you're into that.

<i>â™ª Just let me take you
for a ride â™ª</i>

I think I like it here.
Are you from here?

[Jess] Hm.
I've never seen you before.

I take it you know
all of your customers.

Sadly, yes, yeah.
Uh, it's a local bar thing.

Most of them at least.
Um, what brings you out tonight?

So many questions.
I'm a bartender.

It's the holidays,
you've walked into my bar alone.

And that means there is a story.

Sorry, it's my job.
And blunt.

I'll stop.
Don't. It-it's fine.

You know, usually, I only get
to talk to the same ten people

that make it their job
to drink here,

and they're all pretty much
sick of me by now, so...

Uh, I'm Danny. Danny Carmody.

Nice to meet you.
Oh, Danny Carmody.

Makes sense.
That's my dead dad.

Oh, my God. Come on.
All right, all right.

I'm done giving you a hard time.
I promise, okay? I'm sorry.

Uh, uh, what do you do?

I paint.
[Danny] Oh, perfect.

Uh, we could really use a new
coat of flat white in here.

Okay, I thought you said
you were

gonna stop
giving me a hard time.

Oh, that's right, I forgot.

Uh, I think the closest thing
we've ever had

to an artist in here
is this guy Frank

who's a sign-spinner
for Superior Mattress.

He's really good, too.
I don't see him now.

Hey, we all got our talents.

But from the looks
of this place,

you could use an
upgrade, junior.

Well, um, you got any pieces
I could hang in here?

I don't think you would be very
interested in my aesthetic.

Hm, dark and brooding,
I take it?

Hm...

I prefer chic,
yet approachable cynic.

Ah, you sound fun.

Yeah, in an Edward Scissorhands
kind of way.

[Danny laughing]

Hm.
Hey, Danny. Oh, uh...

Just give me,
give me one second.

Oh, yeah, go, do your thang.

"Do your thang?"

So...
Oh, my gosh!

You're married?
What?

Are you married?

Um, no.
Oh, gosh, um...

Danny.
[Danny] I'm sorry, buddy.

Good.
Hm?

<i>â™ª And opened my sky â™ª</i>

Get another one going.

<i>â™ª Don't need no lie â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the kind of love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the kind of love
that I want â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That's the kind of love
that's the kind of love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I say
that's the kind of love â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª By myself â™ª</i>


[indistinct song playing]

So soon?
[Jess] Uh, yeah.

I, uh, promised my friend I'd go
to a company Christmas party.

So alone, but not alone.
Keep digging.

Well, you're kind of breaking
my heart here.

Hm.
[Annie] Danny.

Here.
Thanks.

Hey, Danny, um, we're thirsty.

Could you get a drink over here?

I think you'll be just fine.

It was, uh, nice meeting you,
Danny Junior.

Uh, nice to meet you,
mysterious artist woman,

whose name, your, can I...
Do I get your name?

<i>â™ª Oh oh oh oh oh â™ª</i>

Ah, dang it.

[bell jingling]


[instrumental music]

"Jess."

[instrumental music]

Why not? Right?

It's not like you could stop me.

All right.

[line ringing]

[cell phone ringing]
Yo!

Hey. You remember that girl
that came in last night?

The Pinot-drinker
you were drooling over? Vaguely.

Um, she, uh, she gave me
her name, but not her number.

Do you think
you could help me find her?

Well, lucky for you, I set up

a social-media account
for your bar.

Remember, with pass code
Danny-1-2-3.

Which spells,
"Hack me, I'm easy."

Hold on, hold on, okay.

[Rick] You got it?
Ah, I'm in.

Well, if she's well-known,
she should be easy

to search and find.

Oh, wow.

Jess Woods, you're, uh,

kind of a big deal.

Oh, um, oh, no.

What happened?
I clicked the like thing.

<i>you're stalking her.</i>

<i>Uh, send here a DM.</i>

Right, right, right.
What is a DM?

It's a direct message,
like a text.

<i>It's that little
paper-airplane thingy.</i>

Oh, okay, okay, got it, okay.

<i>- Okay, thanks. Bye.</i>
Bye, Danny.

It's done. It's done. She's...

She's either gonna say yes
or she's gonna say yes.

[dog whines]

You weren't there.
You don't know.

[dog whines]

No reply yet. Is that bad?

[dog whines]

[cell phone chimes]

Oh, no.

Ah...

[line ringing]

[Casey]<i>Jess.</i>
Oh, hey.

Cas, uh, can you meet me
at the lounge for brunch?

I will provide
the hangover helper.


Wait, hockey bar?
Yeah, he's the owner.

What, Danny?
You know Danny?

Everyone knows Danny. He's like
the Duluth golden boy.

Mm-hmm. Well...
Crushed on by all the ladies.

Yeah, he was a charmer, funny.

Smooth-talker, very handsome.
Oh.

Ah, and he kept calling me out

a few times,
which I, you know...

When are you guys
gonna get married?

Okay, slow down.

He was wearing a moose T-shirt

and he smelled like beer.

That's a Minnesota sex symbol

for most women around here.

Why do you think
she hasn't responded yet?

She definitely gonna respond,
though, inevitably. She...

Yeah, no, still hasn't replied,
in case you were wondering.

And I want <i>youto be happy.</i>

I am happy. I am.

You know, Mark and I,
we spent years

traveling
and chasing our big dreams.

And when we finally felt like
we'd made it, we settled here.

And he has roots here,
and, I don't know...

I just, without him, I wonder,

is this where
I'm supposed to be?

I think there's somebody
out there for you

if you open yourself up
to the possibility.

Like, maybe a hockey-loving,
beer-scented possibility?

Does lightning strike twice? You
know that I believe in signs.

Right, and have you ever seen
more of a sign that says

"You're not a match" than this?

What? I don't see a sign.

He wants me to go to

a college hockey game with him.

Jess, he like you!
What?

He's taking initiative.
Plus, he's a business owner.

So what he likes hockey?
Fine, but for our first date?

I mean, what could we possibly
have in common?

And I have work, right?
I have a show coming up.

Okay, let me remind you
that he is cute and he's nice.

Oh, and also he is cute,
and you really like him.

Stop fighting yourself.

You're a widow, Jess.
You're not dead.

It's one date.

Ooh, fine.

Okay, okay.

I'm doing it.
It's a Christmas miracle.

[computer chimes]

<i>â™ª La-la la-la â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fa-la la-la-la la-la la-la â™ª</i>

Well, man, she said yes.


<i>in the midst of the longest
losing streak in team history.</i>

<i>It would take a miracle
for the Bulldogs</i>

<i>to come back
this late in the season.</i>

<i>With playoffs
right around the corner,</i>

<i>they don't seem
to stand a chance.</i>

<i>I guess the only question is</i>

<i>when is this losing streak
gonna end?</i>

<i>â™ª Wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Good tidings we bring
to you and... â™ª</i>

Hi.

I gotta admit,
there's a part of me

that thought
you might not show up.

There's a part of me
that thought the same.

<i>â™ª Wish you a Merry Christmas â™ª</i>

Come on. After you.

[upbeat music]

Oh, oh.

Oh.
Oh, whoa!

Good job!
Yeah, I love this sport.

Well, these are great seats.
Yeah, uh...

You remember my Uncle Pat,
sat next to you at the bar?

Dad jokes? Who could forget?

Oh, he's retired now,

but he worked for Bulldogs,
for, like, 40 years.

He was in charge of maintenance
on the Zamboni.

What the hell is a Zamboloni?

Say you're not from Minnesota

without saying
you're not from Minnesota.

Indiana.
Yup.

I'm from Indiana, Hoosier state.

why don't you tell me

what you think a Zamboni is.

Okay, a Zamboni.
Simple. Yes.

Is it a horn that you blow

when someone gets a goal?

Maybe?
This close, so close. It's...

Okay, it's a giant machine that
someone drives on to the ice

to, yes, to shave
and clean the ice,

so it's ready
for the next part of the game.

I can't believe I didn't guess

that extremely technical
insider term.

I can't believe you thought
Bulldogs hired my uncle

to clean a giant trumpet
for 40 years.

Hey, Dogs, let's go, let's go!
Bring it! Whoo!

<i>â™ª Let's go oh oh â™ª</i>
â™ª Let's go â™ª

a little basic information.

The white, clear stuff
that they are on,

that's called the ice.
So it's very cold.

The little black thing
is called the puck.

The long, wooden bent thing,

it's called the hockey stick.

Wow, you don't say.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Very couture. Allow me, sir.
Very handsome.

Well, did you, uh, always know
you wanna be an artist?

Mm, you know,
for the longest time,

I thought my art would only
hang on my parents' fridge.

But then I had
the most amazing teacher

who made a living selling
her art, and it lit a spark.

I was, um, studying in Indiana,
and the university here

offered me
a teaching fellowship.

So I painted and I taught,
you know?

There's a very loyal collector's
scene here in Duluth,

and, well, the paintings
sort of took off, and here I am.

You're still teaching?

It's just not the time
right now.

Pretzels.
Yeah.

Zamboni. That's it, right?
That's a Zamboni.

<i>â™ª The magic of
the magic of Christmas â™ª</i>

[whistle blows]
Penalty!

[indistinct yelling]
Oh!

<i>Oh, no! It looks like we have
a penalty for the Bulldogs.</i>

Come on, ref!
Bull crap! Are you blind?

to get off the ice!

Are you okay?
Yeah.

No sweat.
Okay.

Kidding me! Rip that stripes!

It's not your pattern!
Try paisley!

<i>Time out. Bulldogs.</i>

<i>in regulation.</i>

<i>The Bulldogs
are taking their timeout.</i>

<i>It would take a miracle
for them to pull out this win.</i>

Right now it's just about
keeping the Blazers from

scoring. Lord knows we'll take
a tie at this point.

Let's end this streak, huh?


<i>It's time to get your kiss on.</i>

<i>Let's get into
that loving Christmas spirit.</i>

Here we go, matching hats
and all! That's nice.

<i>Oh, God, Kiss Cams
are so embarrassing.</i>

Yeah, don't worry,
I have been to, conservatively,

like, 300 games, never once been
on the jumbo-tron.

So we're good,
we-we're gonna be fine.

<i>deer-in-the-headlights couple.</i>

<i>Never seen this before,
apparently.</i>

[Tom]<i>Oh!</i>
It's our first date!

Cut us a break.
<i>- Put that pretzel down.</i>

<i>Let's make some noise.</i>

kiss, kiss.

Come on, you two.
You don't have to.

It's for the win!
You do not have to.

It's for the win.

<i>â™ª Can't live like this
no more â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Time for me to say goodbye â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Open up my eyes love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the old me goodbye â™ª</i>

[buzzer buzzing]
Stay strong, Bulldogs!

[crowd cheering]

[instrumental music]

Wait.

[whistle blows]
[crowd cheering]

Oh, my God!
Yeah!

We won? We won?
Yes!

We won, yeah!
Yes!

<i>Bulldogs win!</i>

<i>A Turpin last-second goal.</i>

<i>And the dreaded streak is over!</i>

Unbelievable!
Yeah!

Give it up for these two
and their lucky lips, huh!

[crowd cheering]

<i>â™ª Shake shake shake
shake shake it loud â™ª</i>

Hey! It's Carmody and Pretzel!
Oh, my gosh!

Okay, I gotta say,
I can't believe

what a good sport you've been
about all this.

Hey, I didn't wanna
incur the wrath

of angry hockey fans
if they lost.

Is that all it was?

This was fun, right?

Getting to see you wear that hat
made the whole day.

It was great. I loved it.

So let's do it again soon.

Yeah.

[instrumental music]

[instrumental music]

Ugh.

[instrumental music]



Danny-1-2-3.

<i>The inspiration
behind my most recent series</i>

<i>comes from my fiance, Mark...</i>

<i>Fiance?</i>

<i>He said he enjoys
Lake Superior most</i>

<i>when it's frozen,
so I started to...</i>

when he passed away?

Yeah, I know. And it was only,
like, two years ago.

Hey, listen, listen, listen.

"In addition to his success
in business,

Mark was also known
for his charitable spirit.

He was the driving force
behind the construction

and programming
of the Duluth Art Institute,

which will now be named
in his honor."

The guy's building's
named after him.

You have a bar
named in your honor.

Hey, come on, Rick, my dad
named this place after himself.

Named after your family,
which makes it legacy.

Look at this guy's
accomplishments.

Wait, wait, wait. Are you
reading me his obituary?

Is that weird?
Yes!

That's weird and creepy.

I guess I'm just surprised that
sh-she didn't mention anything.

Okay, well, not everybody
is like you and spills

their whole life story
at the drop of a coaster.

Everybody processes grief
differently.

Uh, think about
when you lost your dad.

Yeah, yeah, you're right, um...
You're right. What do I do?

Closing the window with his
obituary would be my first move.

[instrumental music]

Oh, my God.
You really like him, don't you?

Okay, I'm trying
not to go overboard.

But, yes,
we had a good time. Hi.

And he gets you
out of your dark little cocoon.

You know, which I thought
I would hate.

But... that kiss.

Mm, that kiss.

it was too forward?

It was a Kiss Cam, okay?

I was under a lot of pressure.

And heat. Well, just saying.

Oh, wait.
Oh!

No, no, I've...
Take it, take it.

I've been avoiding.
It's the art institute.

They want me to help them
with this after-school program.

Why would they bother you
with that?

Maybe because I promised them
that I would do it.

Jess!
I know.

I know.
It was always important to Mark.

And then it gets me thinking
about Mark.

And with this, you know,

whatever this thing is
with Danny...

You're moving on.
It's perfectly normal.

I just don't know if I'm ready.

Ah.

No one is ever ready,

but life goes on,
whether we like it or not.

So have you told Danny?
About Mark?

He's probably
figured it out already.

Well, that's not the same
as telling him.

And I doubt he figured
anything out about you.

The man has a flip phone.

You know, you're always
talking about how honesty

is the most important thing
to you?

Then just be honest.
Maybe you're right.

You know, he did say
he wanted to see my work.

A terribly normal response.

Are you gonna take him
to one of the galleries

that has your stuff?

I think I have a better idea.

Okay, settle down. Come on.

[instrumental music]

[cell phone chimes]
Oh.

<i>â™ª Shall we stop right here
for gas? â™ª</i>

Oh, I guess
I didn't screw up too bad.

What's that?
Someone got a second date.

Ooh.
Yeah. Oh, shit.

That's weird. She wants to meet
exceedingly early for dinner.

Mm, that's strange.
Yeah.

Um, have you been to Apostle?

Apostle? They opened back up?

Ah, okay, now I need a jacket.

Oh, you made her dress down,

so now she wants you
to dress up.

Okay, I have a jacket.

Not a rain jacket.
No, I know.

Like a, like a, like a...
Straightjacket.

Yellow jacket?
It is this guy jacket, but...

[instrumental music]

<i>â™ª I'm coming down the chimney â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just want you
here with me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And let's slide away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Near the fireplace â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I'm real and I'm â™ª</i>

[indistinct chatter]

Hey, guys!
Hey!

[indistinct chatter]

Grab me a stout.
Got you.

Hey, I, I forgot about the Santa
Crawl, I-I thought it started

at 9:00. I mean, I gotta go.
I really gotta go.

I'm not stopping you. Just
cursing you under my breath.

Yeah, thanks. Okay, good luck.
And, Uncle Pat.

As your favorite nephew
and main source of inebriation,

I need you to get back here
and help him pour beers.

I'm on it. I can handle that.

All right.

Oh, oh!

Oh, man!

The sport coat's
in the trunk of my car.

It's open, go!

Hey, are you okay?

[instrumental music]

[elevator bell dings]

I wanted to get here early
so you could

see the view of Lake Superior.

Once it gets dark,
you can't really see much.

my whole life.

I've-I've never been up here.


Yeah, it is.

May I take your coat?
Oh, thank you.

I'll get this.
Thank you so much.

Um, my, uh, dinner jacket

suffered an occupational
hazard earlier.

I dig it. I mean...

You know, the peekaboo
of the wrist, it's very sexy.

Thank you. Uh, this was in the
trunk of Pat's ancient Buick.

I'm pretty sure he wore it
to a Huey Lewis concert in '89.

Ms. Woods.
Oh, hi.

Your table's right this way.

Thank you so much.


Wait. Are these yours?
Mm.

These and, um, a few others.

Jess, they're amazing.
Thank you.

You said you wanted to see
some of my work,

and I thought my dining room
was a little stuffy.

No, this is perfect.
Oh, good.

Ah, this is lovely. Thank you.

So the owners were
some of my first collectors.

Normally when I sell the piece,
I don't get to see it again.

But with these, I get to stop in
and say hello.

Nostalgic.
I mean, that was the thought.

But suddenly I'm feeling weird.
Like, a...

It's a tad bit, um, narcissistic

to be having our second date
just surrounded by my art.

You know, I'm glad you brought
it up because I am actually...

Very uncomfortable right now.
Another thing we agree on.

I should go.
Don't forget your jacket.

Oh, I will never forget
this jacket.

Oh. Oh.
Oh.

I took the liberty
to order for us.

Is that okay? Great.
Yeah. Thank you.

Beats the heck out of a pretzel,
right?

I don't know.
I think they both have a place.

Ah, cheers to that.

Cheers.
Mm.

I basically grew up at that bar.

My dad would fix me cherry Cokes

and I would sit on the bar
and listen to all the old-timers

tell stories about, you know,

how Bob Dylan was born on their
street. All of them liars.

Wait, I thought
Bob Dylan was born in Duluth.

Oh, he was,
just not on their streets.

Ah.
Now, this was in the heyday.

Like, the Bulldogs
barely lost a game in the '90s.

By the time I was 12 or 13, I
was clearing and pouring beers.

You were pouring beers at 12?
A different time.


And my mom died
when I was just a kid,

so, um, the bar just...

always felt like home, you know?

I'm sorry.

Even though they're gone, uh,

this feels like
where my family is.

Mm.

You didn't ever wanna do
anything else?

When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a dinosaur.

And then an astronaut.

But, um, before I had any time

to put any real sincere thought
into my future,

uh, the path with the bar
was already laid out for me.

Uh, it feels really good
to get out of my little world

for a night.

Thanks.

I like your story.

Which part? The Dinosaur part?

The honesty part.

Hey, you know you can, uh,
you can be honest with me, too.

Right?

Of course.

So, question. Um...
Hm.

Do you wanna do something
really dumb with me tomorrow?

Yeah. But how dumb?

<i>â™ª Oh Christmas tree

Whaa!

<i>â™ª Unchanging â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh Christmas tree

<i>â™ª Thy leaves

Yes. Yes.
Wow.

You know,
back before this slump,

you couldn't hear
yourself think.

It'd get so loud in here
on game days.

Okay. Well... Well...

I'm going to risk
my brooding-artist reputation

and say I wouldn't hate

going to another hockey game
at some point.

Well, there is another game
tomorrow.

Uh, I said at some point.

Is that a no?

Can we get those seats again?
Uncle Pat!

Can we get seats again?

Nope.
Come on...

Uncle Pat.
Uncle Pat?

Fine. Only because
she brought us luck.

<i>â™ª Oh Christmas tree

<i>"Mark meets challenges
with a unique creativity</i>

which sets him apart
from others in his field.

Faced with difficulty,
Mark is fond of quoting Picasso,

'Everything you can imagine
is real.'"

I mean, come on!
With this guy...

He's perfect.

[cell phone ringing]

Shit!

I know. I know.

All right, okay, all right,
this is not healthy. Enough.

[upbeat music]

Hey! Glad you two are back.

Sure could use some more of
your, uh, luck tonight.

Huh? Big game.
We're on a roll, baby! Yeah!

You're cute,
but, you know, superstition

is just the figment
of your imagination?

Ah, you gotta let him believe
whatever he wants, right?

You know what they say,
"Everything you can imagine

is real."

That's Picasso.

Is it? You know, I knew
I heard that somewhere.

I-I-I never would've been able
to tell you it was Picasso.

Aw. Oh.

You're a little more
sophisticated than you let on.

Okay, so now that we won that,

where does that put us
in the whole playoff thing?

Ooh, do not say the P word.
We don't say that.

We can't jinx anything.
[Jess] So superstitious.

Yoo-hoo! Lovebirds! Hello?
Yes!

What? Otto? I didn't know
you were a fan.

Oh, nobody's a bigger fan
than Bebe.

And to see you on Kiss Cam

gave Bebe and I
the warm fuzzies all over.

Right, Bebe?

Mm. Yes, I see that. Um...

Uh, Danny,
this is Otto and Bebe,

two long-time supporters
of my art work.

She's the best. Such an eye.
Thank you.

Well, it-it's nice to meet you.
Likewise.

What do you do, Danny?
Oh. Uh, uh...

Uh, I am a-a bar owner.

Yes, only the nicest,
coziest bar in the city.


We'd love to come in sometime

for a splash of Madeira.

Oh, I-I love to hear that. I am
fresh out of business cards...

Allow me.
Oh.

Fantastic. I'll reach out.

How's the painting coming along?

Great. Just great.
[Otto] Good.

I'm glad you're getting
so much accomplished

because I have a feeling
they're going to want

a lot more of your time,
right, Bebe?

My, my time?

For the games.
We're a superstitious lot.

Aren't we, Bebe?
[Jess] Yes. Yes.

I can see that.

Well, uh, we should go.
We should go.

Yeah.
Very nice talking to you.

<i>- Enchante.</i>
Mm, um...

Yes. Thank you.
Bye.

See, this piece I love.
It's-it's mix-media.

It's water color with etching...

It just is about starting.
That's beautiful.

You just have to start.
Well, yeah.

Isn't that the case
with everything?

How does it feel?
It feels good.

It's so beautiful.

I know another woman that makes
a living painting abstract art.

She's pretty cool, too,

Here you go.

Art-gallery acumen.

Oh! That was cheating.

She thinks it's exciting
and fun, ladies and gentlemen!

[all cheering]

Well, since everyone's
in a jolly mood,

now's a good a time as any
to announce.

The powers that be have asked me
to invite you two

to host the Bulldogs
Annual Holiday Shootout!

What do you say?

Uh...
Um, heck. Why not?

[all cheering]

What did I just agree to?
Oh, man.

Oh, my family's gonna flip.
We make a whole day out of it.

We take my nieces out
to ice-skating

and pizza afterwards.
It's a whole thing.

You're gonna meet literally
my entire family.

Like, everyone.
The whole Carmody clan.

Wow, that's some...
Yeah.

That's-that's great.
That's so great.


Ahem.
[Casey] You guys!

Hi!
Hi!

Danny, you remember Jared?

Good to see you, man.
Likewise.

Yeah.
Hi.

People are officially
losing their minds over you two.

Today I literally saw someone
with a sweatshirt.

With both of your faces on it.
You think that's crazy?

I walked past St. John's
and the priest

yelled, "Pucker up, Pretzel!"

you're kind of screwed

'cause no one
can change anything,

because if they lose,
they'll blame you forever.

Do you want people to hate you?
No one?

No!
Not anything at all?

You haven't had the conversation
about Mark.

I can't.
Everything is so perfect.

I don't wanna cast a shadow
over it all.

You know what they say
the worst conversation is?

Illuminate.
The one you're not having.

Look, we always think
it's worse than what it is.

I'm just saying,
it's not gonna get any easier.

[upbeat music]

I can't be the first girl
you've danced with in your bar.

Mm. Is that a little jealousy
I'm sensing?

Maybe. Look.

All I've ever heard is that
everyone is in love with you.

So you being single
doesn't add up.

I-I live here. I work here.

I know everybody here.

It's, it's been hard
to meet someone.

<i>â™ª Can't be mine holding â™ª</i>

Mm. I'm glad I happened in.

Me, too.

Hey, you wanna do something
I've never done with anybody?

Promise, I've never done
with <i>anybody?</i>

Mm-hmm.
Okay. Come on. Come on.

<i>â™ª These red and green lights â™ª</i>

[Danny] Nice view, huh?
Yeah. It's beautiful.

Yeah.
Um...

of ruining the moment,

uh, uh, there's something
I gotta tell you,

and it's kinda hard to say.

Whatever it is,
I'm here for you.

It's okay. You can tell me.

I, I'm feeling kind of nervous

about spending a whole day
with your family.

I don't even do that
with my own family, ever.

Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
No. No, no. Don't be. No.

It just, I get,

uh, weird around the holidays.

Hey, it's, it's fine.

You do not have to do anything
that you don't wanna do.

Can I ask why the holidays
are hard for you?

It's just, um...

I... It's deadlines.

Uh, Sonja always schedules
my show around this time.

I am in the middle
of painting this series

and I am really behind.

Yeah, no. I didn't realize.

And Sonja,
she gets here tomorrow,

and when she see my progress,
she's gonna lecture me...

Uh, I, uh, wish

there was something
I could do or say to... help.

Someone once said to me they
liked the lake best in winter...

how the sun melts it one day

and then refreezes it
the very next day.

Reminded him it-it was alive.


I, I feel like
if you need to work

or, you know,
I can give you a ride home.

No.

No, stay.

For a minute.
I like this moment.

[instrumental music]


Hey, you and Jess
looked pretty cozy last night.

Things are getting serious, huh?

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I...

I think so.
You don't sound so sure.

There's something that we need
to talk about, but we aren't.

Ah! That's half of what makes
a relationship work.

Ignoring the right things.

But, uh, you think
it's something

that could end you two?

I mean, I, I hadn't been
thinking that, but, uh, maybe.

Let me give you
a piece of advice.

I would actually really
appreciate that right now.

Drag it out
until the season's over.

I don't care if you mess up
your relationship.

It wouldn't be the first time.

But don't mess up this season.
We're too close.

Thank you, Uncle Pat,
for your kind words

of comfort and support.

That's what uncles are for.

I wanted to...
Jj-jj! Unh!

I haven't exactly figured...

Jess. Jess.
What?

What is it exactly
that I'm looking at here?

Ah...
[cell phone chimes]

Um...
Mm.

I, I, I haven't exactly
figured out

what I wanna say.

Well, that much is clear.
But...

I promise you,
I am going to buckle down.

I-I feel a breakthrough coming.

Uh-huh? Really?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Oh, great. Wonderful.
[cell phone chimes]

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

You know, I saw a familiar face
puckering up

on the, uh, local news
this morning.

to have become a big hit

in this town.

I'm not laughing.

It is nothing, okay?
Really, Sonja, it's nothing.

Dating is not nothing for you,
Jess. It's a big deal.

I-I'm aware of that.
And I'm proud of you.

And that's your friend Sonja
talking. Hm?

The gallery owner who has
invested a great deal of time

and resources into you
is gonna talk now.

I do not represent artists
who aren't focused,

who miss shows,
who don't take opportunities

sitting right in front of them
seriously.

Are you dropping me right now?
No! No, no, no!

Most certainly not.
Well, not right now anyway.

But, look,
I need you to know this.

Your friend Sonja
will always be here. Understand?

Understood.
Okay.

Yes, well, I-I-I-I... Yeah.

Well, I'll-I'll just leave you
to it. Yeah?

Whatever that is.

[clears throat]
Hm.

Hello? It's fine.
Hey. How's work?

anything? Uh...

A coffee or a gingerbread latte
or something?

No. Um, thanks, though.

It would just be another way
to procrastinate.

<i>Well...</i>

I was just calling
to, uh, to see what time

you wanted me to pick you
up, the-the game starts at 7:00.

<i>Didn't know if you wanted
to get dinner first...</i>

Oh, Danny.

I can't tonight.
I-I-I have so much work to do.

Oh, okay. Uh, okay. Thought we,
thought we had a plan.

<i>and I'm sorry.</i>

But I just really, really need
to pull my show together.

Uh, are you sure, maybe just

if you wanna come
for the third period?

<i>Just a little distraction
for you.</i>

Distraction is the problem.

I can't go to every game. Okay?

I can't... I can't take on
that kind of pressure.

Yeah, no, totally.
Um, I get that.

I hope so.
[Danny]<i>Okay.</i>

I'm so sorry.


Hi. What's all this?
Where's Jess?

She's working.
What? No!

I told you about your shootout
costume-fitting at the party.

At least I think I did. Did I?

Uh...
Arms out, please.

We-we can reschedule with Jess.

There's still time
before the shootout.

Where is she?
We'll just go to her next.

No, you will not.
Danny-boy!

There is a schedule here.
Well, what can I say?

She's busy.
We'll-we'll-we'll figure it out.

You know, if your Aunt Laurie
and I had the opportunity

to dress up like
big, kissing lips...

puckering.

[cell phone chimes]

You know, we went
as Barbra Streisand

and Kris Kristofferson
for Halloween one year.

What? Why are you
telling me this?

I'm just saying. Got pretty
steamy when we got home.

Your aunt looked pretty sexy
with that beard.

[cell phone chimes]

Oh, no.
I can see it.

I don't like it,
but, but I see it.

Can't unsee it.

[instrumental music]

Hello? Oh. Danny.

Hey. Oh. I-I, I guess Pat did
tell you about the fitting.

You call this an emergency?
Wait, what?

Wait, I said I was
on a deadline. I'm painting.

No, I-I thought you were.
Well...

Wait, did you trick me
to get me here?

W-what are you talking about?

Um, I... Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Please. Can you just...

Yeah. Not-not right now.
Thank you.

Look, okay, Danny,
I'm sorry, but I, I can't.

I can't risk my career
over a superstition.

I can't do the shootout,
I can't do the games.

I'm not a mascot. I'm sorry.

No, I-I get that. I-I'm sorry.

Um, but I-I-I promise
that I didn't...

What did you do?
Technically, uh...

[Jess sighs]

[instrumental music]

[music continues]

[knocking on door]

if you're in there,

but, uh, that was all my fault
yesterday.

Danny told me
we shouldn't bother you.

Uh, uh, there's some coffee
and donuts.

I'm just gonna leave 'em
out here.

Sorry again, Jess.
Don't blame him.

Hey, did you know Santa's
biggest regret every year

after the hubbub of Christmas?


Lack of elf-awareness.

[Pat chuckles]

[door opens]

It was me, Jess.
Danny had nothing to do with it.

I-I'm sorry. Forgive me?

Show's over, Pretzel.

Better late than never?

Hi.
And I hate letting people down.

And I see that I missed it.
I'm sorry.

No. I-I... I'm the one
that should be sorry. I...

No, it's okay,
Uncle Pat stopped by

with donuts, bad jokes
and an apology.

I'm sure he did, because I was
about to ban him from the bar

for life.

I am sorry.
I lost my temper yesterday.

I never should've made you
feel pressured into anything.

Yesterday when I got home,
I was so overcome with emotion,

I haven't painted like that
in a long time.

I didn't mean to upset you.
It was good.

It was good?
Cathartic, really.

Look, I, uh...

Uh, I have to tell you
something.

What is it?

I was engaged.

And my <i>fiance, Mark...</i>

he died two years ago.

And I didn't wanna ruin
anything, so I didn't tell you.

[instrumental music]

Jess, uh...

I'm-I'm sorry. That's terrible.

And I'm not proud of myself
for keeping it from you.

So much has been coming up,
well, emotions and-and confusion

and, uh, pressure
from work and...

It's okay. It's okay. I'm-I'm,
I'm really glad you told me.

Yeah?
I understand.

See, you say that,
but <i>Idon't even understand.</i>

And... Well...
What?

Look, I realize
it's not fair to you

for me to pretend
like I'm single

when I-I don't have
the first clue

of how I separate myself
from him.

And...

that's the honest truth of it.

But you don't have
to separate yourself.

He's just a part of you now.

And I'm okay with that.
You're sweet.

I, I gotta get back to work.

I'll-I'll call you later, okay?
Okay.

but somehow it feels worse.

Gosh, she was all set
to marry this great guy.

She knows that I know, but
she doesn't know that I knew,

and I think she just thinks
it all feels weird and wrong.

Are you keeping track of all
this, 'cause I-I got a little

lost there myself,
but bottom line is that

I can't give up, I can't
give up, I gotta figure out

how to let her know
that it's okay, it's...

[dog whines]
Yeah. I know.

I gotta do something.

[instrumental music]

[cell phone chimes]

Yeah.

Where are you taking me?

there, we're almost there.


Wait, wait. What are we doing?
What are we doing here?

Hey, Danny,
what are we doing here?

Uh, this is the surprise.

Okay.

Look, I don't think
you understand.

No. No, no, no. I do.
I understand that...

You, yesterday you told me
about Mark.

I need you to know
that I'm okay with it.

Really? Wait, hold on. Hold on,
what are you talking about?

Yes, yesterday
I told you about Mark.

I didn't tell you
about this place.

No, but, um...

But, I, uh...
What, you, like, looked it up?

Well, yeah, I guess. Is that...

I haven't been here since Mark.

Hey, I-I didn't mean to...

That was
the worst year of my life. Uh...

When did you find out
about this?

How long have you known
about it, about Mark?

Uh, I knew, okay?

I got curious. I felt
that was a natural reaction.

I, but I knew it wasn't my place
to bring it up.

No, it wasn't. It wasn't your
place. This is not your place.

No, I know.
I know it's not my place.

That's what I'm trying to say.

Let's see, what else?

What else
did you find out about?

Oh, the lakes, okay.
No, Let's-let's not do this.

Um, his businesses.
I tried to ask you about it.

Get you to tell me
that you, you...

Did you read the interviews?

Oh, my God.

"Everything you can imagine
is real?"

So that wasn't a coincidence
at all.

You knew about it
and you used it.

Oh. No, no, no.
That was an accident, okay?

Jess, can you hear me out?
No, I...

I need to be alone.
I have to think.

It's freezing, just let me...
I'll give you a ride home, okay?

Danny, I'm sorry. Okay?

I thought I was ready for this,
but I'm not.

<i>as all this time, once again</i>

<i>the Bulldogs just can't seem
to get out of their own way.</i>

<i>With that loss,
the team is on the verge</i>

<i>of being eliminated
from playoff contention.</i>

<i>So much for
a Merry Christmas miracle.</i>

Just turn it off, Rick.

Anyhow, how about another IPA?
It's on me.

IPA? I don't want anything
from you. Gross.

Rick, our sweet friend, we would
love another drink from you.

blaming this on me.


You really know how to kick
a guy when he's down.

I told ya.
And you had to go screw it up.

Sorry, bud.

Hi.

All right, listen up,
everybody, okay?

On the subject of Danny, now I'm
sorry that our team is losing,

but this is Danny's entire life
we're talking about.

So let's cut him a little slack.

No!
Okay, tough crowd. Um...

There's gotta be a way
to get the magic back. Big J!

Yeah?
You're in a relationship.

You're on, baby.
[Kim] Whoo-hoo!

Pat, cough up the tickets.

[indistinct song]

[indistinct chatter]

Uncle Pat! Uncle Pat! Uncle Pat!


<i>â™ª I see sky so clear... â™ª</i>


<i>a couple. Here's a couple.</i>

<i>â™ª Life... â™ª</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>â™ª When you're near... â™ª</i>

[indistinct chatter]

<i>Sadly, the Bulldogs lose again.</i>

Failure.

<i>â™ª Here â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh-oh-oh-oh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I know... â™ª</i>

<i>from a lack of effort, though,</i>

<i>by the superstitious
Bulldog fans,</i>

<i>who's been desperately
trying to see</i>

<i>if they can replicate the luck
of the lucky-lips duo,</i>

<i>and find
another kissing combination</i>

<i>to stop the skid once again.</i>

<i>Unbelievably, all of the teams
in the conference</i>

<i>are separated by just one game.</i>

<i>One win or loss by any team

<i>a destination

<i>â™ª My hope was slowly fading â™ª</i>â™ª Ooh ooh â™ª

<i>â™ª But then this angel

<i>Maybe you two. Give it a shot.</i>

<i>Come on, we need some real love.</i>

<i>Little too lucky, wow.</i>

<i>â™ª The story goes... â™ª</i>

Come on, make it happen.

<i>â™ª Whoa I've waited for â™ª</i>

[whistle blows]
Uh!

<i>â™ª 'Cause you are... â™ª</i>

<i>Fans are starting to wonder
if the Bulldogs</i>

<i>really have a chance
at the playoffs.</i>

<i>â™ª That one â™ª</i>

[instrumental music]

This is ridiculous, you can't

just sit on your hands here,
junior.

I know, I know.
I-I gotta do something, right?

Hey, does she have a dog?

You can go to the same park,
you can...

Hobie's leash could get
all tangled up with hers

until you're so wrapped up that

you kiss her or something.
Dogs are good that way.

<i>â™ª Christmas ain't the same
without your â™ª</i>

Why don't you have
another one, Pat? Heh-heh.

[indistinct song playing]

Got it. I got it.
Got what? Uh...

<i>â™ª Those Christmas bells â™ª</i>

That's good.

Yes, and-and just make sure
it's even on both ends, please.

And then on the other si...

Other side, um,
if I could get measurements

of those two in the middle,
middle.

[Jess] Sonja? Hi.
Yes?

I-I see that you're very busy,

but I was hoping
that we could talk.

Nope. Show canceled.
Wait, sh-show canceled?

Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

I thought it was implied
in my, oh, I don't know,

100 conversations or texts.

Oh. I've had a huge breakthrough
and I'm halfway there.

Oh! This is good news,
isn't it?

Oh.
Oh, it will be fine.

What will be fine?

Okay, although you're definitely
on Santa's naughty list,

I really can't complain because
somebody's already bought

every piece of
<i>Winter: Light And Dark.</i>


Way to bury the lead!
I know.

This is, this is, this is
amazing. Who? Who is it?

They told me not to get
into any details with you,

they will meet you
at your place at 1:00 today.

I mean, thank you.

Shh. Not another word.
And, Jess...

Do you think I don't understand
what you're going through?

It's been heartbreaking for me
to be a part of it.

I just felt like you needed
to get back into your painting

just as much as you needed
to get back into life!

So as your rep and your friend,
hm, I love you.

I...

Mm-mm! Watch the dress.

Mwah. I know. Mm-mm-mm!
I love you, too.

Okay.
Go, go, go.

Perfect.

I said the middle. Uh!

[instrumental music]

[knocking on door]

[Jess gasps]

Bebe? It's you?

I-I... Where's Otto?

Oh, he had
a previous engagement.

I know you must be a little
surprised to see me here.

It is very unexpected.

Well, come in.
Um, yeah, come in.

Oh, my God. How did you know
I needed a buyer?

Oh, we stopped in Danny's
for a drink on Tuesday night

after he extended an invitation.

It's very charming there.
Mm. You can't deny that.

Uh, do you mind
if I take a closer look?

Please.

You know, I can't tell you how
much your support means to me.

I mean, the-the color,
the light, the texture.

Ah. These are tremendous.

I've been terrified
to show them to anyone.

Yeah, this must have been
a very difficult series.

Hm. I, I didn't wanna
be disappointed. I-I...

I can't take on
much more disappointment.

Ah, but that's life, Jess.
You knew that.

Without a bit of risk,
what would there be

to gain, in art and in love?

Now, I understand, this is only

half of what we purchased,
correct?

Yes, um,
this is <i>Winter Dark. Um...</i>

Some of the pieces
are wrapped up, but I,

I haven't started
on <i>Winter Light.</i>

Well, we'll have <i>Winter
Dark</i> picked up by courier

tomorrow morning,
and as for the other pieces,

I'd like you to choose
their home, where you see fit.

Hm?
You let us know.

We wanna make a donation.

What? Bebe!

That is so generous. Thank you.

No, thank you.

I haven't had this much fun
with a surprise

since I hid inside
Otto's 60th birthday cake.

Imagine his face
when his twin sister popped out.

Twin sister!

So d-do you have a place
in mind?

I think I do.
Good.

[music continues]

[Jess sniffles]

<i>this is the game</i>

<i>Bulldogs Nation has been
waiting for.</i>

<i>Thanks to some timely losses
by the Stouts</i>

<i>and also by the Whirlers,
the Bulldogs</i>

<i>playoff hopes are still alive.</i>

<i>Yes, and the Bulldogs
are now in a position</i>

<i>where they can control
their own destiny.</i>

<i>And it's really
a very basic principle.</i>

<i>Absolutely. Win, they're in,
lose and...</i>

Oh, well, we'll know
what happens then.

<i>after that epic losing streak,</i>

<i>that we would both be sitting
here right now?</i>

Hey. Jess!
[Kim] Hey, Jess.

Hey. Uh, Is Danny around?

Up on the roof.
Okay.

[Jess exhales]

Hey, stranger.

Uncle Pat told me
you were up here.

Hey, I just came
from the art institute.

Is that a good thing.
Mm.

Yeah, after you talked to Bebe
the other day, she decided

to purchase all my paintings
and donate the unfinished ones

to wherever I choose. Thank you.

Uh, that must feel amazing.

It does. Yeah, feels great.

Jess, I don't know
what I was thinking.

We weren't thinking or...

Maybe we were thinking too much.

Every day I wanted to tell you,
but every day I was

just falling
harder and harder for you.

And I did a dumb thing.

I mean, Mark didn't know
anything about art either.

But like you,
he just knew what he liked.

And he was kind and generous
like you, too.

[Danny] You don't have to...
No.

I know that I don't have to.

But you need to know
that you have inspired me

more than I could ever tell you.

But I do still miss him.

I still see my dad every day.

Um, every time I walk
by the place

where he used to add up
the receipts at his desk,

any time my uncle cracks
his dumb smile.

Yeah.
Uh...

I'm-I'm so thankful for the ways
that he's still here,

and the things he left behind.

It's different, but they're
never gone. They're never gone.

I appreciate that.

And I'm trying and I'm...

I've made mistakes, too,
and you've been amazing.

I just, um...

I'm not good
at all of this right now.

It's okay, it's okay.
Come here, Jess.

I just... I can't.

<i>out of their own zone,</i>

<i>they get to the red line
and move it up to the blue line</i>

<i>and dump it in
the Stingers' zone.</i>

<i>so far, Tom, I've really</i>

<i>been impressed
what those Bulldogs</i>

<i>have done in the offensive zone.</i>

Hey, Jess?

In case I don't see you again,

I just wanna give you a hug.

Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Don't give up.

Don't ever give up on love.

Okay, Uncle Pat.
Come on, walk you out.

So is this goodbye?

For now.

Uh, I can, uh,
I can give you a ride.

No. Uh...

It'll be fine.

Come on, you got a bar
full of customers.

It's not my first time
taking a cab.

[car door opens]

please.

<i>neutralize, they have to reset,</i>

<i>time 20 down on the clock,
an opportunity for...</i>

How did it go?

Uh, well...

She's gone and I'm in here,
so, I'd say, not good.

What do you always say
we gotta have?


Not sure it's in the cards
on this one, guys, but thanks.

Let me pour you a beer,
from your own bar?

[indistinct commentary on TV]

[Annie] Sorry, Danny.
Yeah, thanks.

<i>to the other side.</i>

<i>Back into the corner.
Then it goes to the high spot.</i>

<i>There's a shot,
there's a chip...</i>

<i>They gotta go back
all the way to the other side,</i>

<i>now across the blue line,
they get to the red line</i>

<i>and across to the blue line.</i>

<i>Now the intensity is
picking up...</i>

Come on, Dogs! Sorry.

I-I can change it if you'd like.

No, uh, it's fine.
You can leave it.

<i>In this period. Close game
between both these teams.</i>

<i>The puck goes inside the zone,</i>

<i>back into the corner,
back to the high top.</i>

<i>Then it goes back
over the other side,</i>

<i>back toward
the high neutral spot.</i>

<i>Then it goes into the corner,
it goes</i>

<i>from one side
to the other side...</i>

Come on. May as well
check out the game.

Only halfway through the second.

May as well.

Oh, no. No! No! No! No!
What?

That... My lucky silver dollar!
I don't have it!

Where is it?
Must be at home.

Well, go get it!
Go on!

Here's your ticket.
Okay, all right.

I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.

[indistinct chatter]

[man 1] Break up!
Pat forgot the silver dollar!

[man 2] It's all over now.

[whistle blows]
Oh...

I can't believe it. I thought
we really had a chance.

<i>it's flying off the clock</i>

<i>faster than we've seen
this Bulldogs season</i>

<i>slip away from us.</i>

<i>Wait, there might be hope.</i>

<i>It appears half
of our lucky-lips duo is here.</i>

<i>That's right,
"Lucky Lips" Danny Carmody</i>

<i>is seated and ready,
but no Pretzel in sight.</i>

<i>Let's see if he has any impact
on the Bulldogs.</i>


Where's Pretzel?

Uh, just-just gonna be me

and Uncle Pat today.

Oh. Screwed it up, huh?

You suck, idiot.

I don't disagree.
All right.

I was a little harsh
on the "idiot" there, right?

Thanks.
But you still suck.

[indistinct commentary on radio]

Uncle Pat.

I'm sorry, just...

just don't go back
'cause, it's, um...

I'm sorry.
Please don't apologize.

You shouldn't feel sorry.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

It's fine.

[man 1] Go! Go, go! Let's go!
[man 2] Let's go!

[crowd cheering]

[crowd cheering]

<i>but they just might have</i>

<i>a Christmas playoff miracle
in them after all.</i>

What's the score?
It's all tied up.

Probably not for long.

<i>for your Bulldogs.</i>

[crowd cheering]

You mind if I just sit here
till Pat gets here?

Be my guest.
[whistle blows]

Time out, Bulldogs.
Cool.

<i>it's time to get lucky.</i>

<i>And, boy, do we need it,
so pucker up!</i>

<i>Oh, wow.
The family sandwich kiss.</i>

<i>Haven't seen that in a while.
Okay, who's next?</i>

<i>Oh, foam-finger guy says,
"Pick me."</i>

<i>Damn, he doesn't waste any time.</i>

<i>And there is the trench coat
in the cheap seats.</i>

<i>Oh! She turns him down.</i>

This is it. Do it.


Anything for luck, right?

<i>of our lucky-lips...</i>

It's okay. It's just a kiss.

Is that Jess?

<i>It appears Pretzel
is back in the building.</i>

<i>Is that Pretzel?</i>

Oh, thank God.
What? Thank God what?

I'm not good enough for you?
No, you're great, you're...

Adorable. Yeah. Just...
Okay, okay, uh...

Pretzel's more my type.

Oh. I'm...

She... Totally.

[indistinct chatter]

Please.
[Tom]<i>Oh!</i>

I'm all right. Yeah. I'm good.

<i>I'm-I'm sure
your time is coming,</i>

<i>but first, all about these two.</i>

So, uh...

falling for me, huh?

Late head over heels in love.

Maybe that kiss
really was lucky.

Wanna find out?
For luck.

For luck. Yeah.

[crowd cheering]
<i>- Let's make some noise!</i>

<i>we've all been waiting for.</i>

No!
<i>- Back together again.</i>

[crowd cheering]

Pretzel! Pretzel!

Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel!
Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel!

[buzzer buzzing]

[man gasps]

Uncle Pat, I thought you were...

I saw that little devil sneak
the tickets in her pocket.

Good move.
Good going, Pat. Come here.

Hey, cheers, everyone!
Hey! Look, look...


Oh! Oh, look!

[Tom]<i>Five seconds to go.</i>
Oh, my God!

<i>Oh, my!
The Stingers' defender has...</i>

Get it in!
<i>- Fallen down! Oh!</i>

[all cheering]


<i>He has done it again!
That's it, folks.</i>

<i>The Bulldogs are going
to the playoffs.</i>

[all cheering]

Bulldogs!

[crowd cheering]

Oh, my gosh!

making things within the lines

or keeping everything
in its boxes.

Art is not only about
making you think,

but it's about making

your thoughts and your mind
feel free.

So paint what makes you
feel free. Yeah?

Oh, Theresa, I gotta go. Okay?
Oh.

Um, gang, keep up the good work,
and I will see you next week.


I'm not mistaken,
you gave me this vest,

uh, four years ago,
and I gave it back to you.

Wait, wait. Shh.
Shh. Shh. Shh.

what you want for Christmas.

I'm just gonna get you
another plaid shirt.

I know you don't need another...
What-what are you...

What's going on?
Why aren't you people drinking?

We all wanted to get you
something real special

for Christmas this year,
and, uh,

Jess came up
with a perfect idea.

I hope you like it.
Okay, everybody, ready?

One, two...

three!

Oh, it's just a mock-up,
the real one is gonna be here

in a couple of weeks. Oh.

And these.


Oh, my gosh!

This is only the coolest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

[both laughing]


Yeah. Okay. Now we can drink!

[all cheering]
[Pat] Hurray! Yes!

[indistinct chatter]


All right, pour the whiskey
and shake 'em.

[man 1]<i>Stevo,</i>
<i>it's your day, baby. Whoo!</i>

<i>Look at him, that's some
lettuce right there, baby.</i>

<i>That's a salad
coming out of that helmet.</i>

<i>Oh! Oh! Great!
She wants to play six on four.</i>

<i>Awesome. Why don't you just
hand him the dummy?</i>

<i>Let's gift-wrap it.
Let's throw a party!</i>

<i>We'll have nice picnic basket,</i>

<i>we'll put the win
into a picnic basket,</i>

<i>we'll get a blanket,
we'll go to a park...</i>

<i>I'm gonna vomit. I'm gonna
vomit on these people.</i>

<i>This is like playing backgammon
with my sister's kids.</i>

I will eat my foam finger for
an actual referee. Argh! Argh!

[man 2]<i>I'd sell some of that</i>
<i>hair, but it looks too good.</i>

[man chuckles]

<i>Hey, it really does.
I love the show here.</i>

<i>Great flow back here,
