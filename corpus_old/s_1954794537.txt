MARCIA?

MARCIA, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

MARCIA.

I'LL TAKE HER.

UH, A BRONX CABBIE WAS ROBBED
AND STRANGLED WITH A G-STRING

BY TWO TWIN SISTERS
WHO WERE TOPLESS DANCERS.

IF THEY WERE TWINS,
THERE COULD ONLY

HAVE BEEN TWO OF THEM, DOCTOR.

AND HE'S OFF AGAIN.

UH, THREE PEOPLE KILLED
BY A GUNMAN IN A SUBWAY CAR.

WE ARE LIKE RATS IN A MAZE,
SCURRYING AROUND,

DEVOURING EACH OTHER.

IT'S A VIOLENT WORLD OUT THERE.

DOCTOR, DID YOU BUY
ANOTHER PAPER

WITH ONLY BAD NEWS IN IT?

GOOD NEWS IS NO NEWS.

JESUS, WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

WHAT YOU TALKING TO HIM FOR?
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR NEXT MOVE.

HURRY UP, OLGA, SHE'LL GET THERE
BEFORE WE DO.

MARCIA, WOULD YOU
PLEASE SLOW DOWN?

I CAN'T HAVE MY STUDENTS SEE ME
BOLTING ACROSS CAMPUS

LIKE A HYPERACTIVE CLYDESDALE.

OH, GOD FORBID.

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

I'M IMPOSING
A TWO-MINUTE TIME LIMIT.

STARTING NOW.

NO TIME LIMIT.
WE AGREED.

YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU SUFFERED FROM ADD.

UH, A WOMAN IN THE BRONX
WAS LOCKED IN A CLOSET

FOR THREE DAYS FOR STARCHING
HER HUSBAND'S UNDERWEAR.

YOU MADE THAT ONE UP.

IT'S RIGHT HERE.

GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN.

HELLO, MARCIA, OLGA.

DAVID, GARY.

GREAT, ANOTHER DISTRACTION.

OH THANK YOU, MR. SOKOL.
IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU TOO.

OH, DR. CHEBRIN, YOU CAME.

OF COURSE, DARLING.

ALL I HAVE TO DO EVENINGS
IS READ MY PAPER, GROW OLDER--

AND FOLLOW HOMICIDE DETECTIVES
AROUND TOWN

FOR LATE BREAKING ATROCITIES.

WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CAKE, MARCIA.

IS IRENE COMING SOON?

YES, SHE HAS A CLASS UNTIL 6:00.

MY GOD, MARCIA,
NOT A MOMENT TO SPARE.

I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD
HAVE STARTED SOONER.

HEY, HEY, GENTLEMEN,
WE'RE PRESSED FOR TIME HERE.

CHECKMATE.

NO!

NO, DON'T.

THANK YOU.

I'VE BEEN BEHIND SCHEDULE SINCE
MY LECTURE CLASS THIS MORNING.

THE QUESTION AND ANSWER
WAS INTERMINABLE.

THEY'RE TRYING TO FATHOM
YOUR PROFUNDITIES.

PLEASE-- THE GIRLS WERE
MENTALLY FILING THEIR NAILS,

WHILE THE BOYS WERE DECIDING
WHO IN CLASS

IS THE WORTHIEST RECIPIENT
OF THEIR NEXT ERECTION.

NO ONE LISTENS ANYMORE.

IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THERE'S A LONG WAITLIST

TO GET IN ANY OF YOUR CLASSES.

OH, OLGA KNOWS THAT--
IT'S JUST A PLOY FOR REASSURANCE.

YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
BEING MARRIED TO A PSYCHOLOGIST

QUALIFIES YOU TO PRACTICE
ON UNWILLING PATIENTS, AND IN PUBLIC.

I'M YOUR SISTER
AND THESE ARE OUR FRIENDS.

DON'T BE SO SENSITIVE.

WHERE'S HARRY AND ANDREW,
ANYWAY?

CHANGING THE SUBJECT
AFTER SAYING SOMETHING

CRUEL AND INSENSITIVE IS A TRAIT
MARCIA PICKED UP AS A CHILD,

AND NEVER QUITE OUTGREW.

I'M YOUR SISTER,
THESE ARE OUR FRIENDS.

LET'S HURRY THIS UP.

SHE'LL BE HERE BEFORE WE'RE
SET UP AND RUIN THE SURPRISE.

YOU'RE GIVE HER
A SURPRISE PARTY EVERY YEAR.

YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'S NOT EXPECTING IT?

WOULD YOU WANT HER NOT TO?

IT WOULD MEAN A SERIOUS FLAW
IN HER REASONING POWER.

I TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO ARRANGE A PARTY THIS YEAR.

SHE BELIEVED US, MR. SOKOL.
IT'S NOT STUPIDITY.

IT'S SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF.

SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF
IS A LITERARY DEVICE,

BUT EMPLOYED IN LIFE,
IT'S CALLED PSYCHOSIS.

OH, SHE'S HERE.

WHY WOULD SHE KNOCK?

SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE
READY TO SURPRISE HER.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY
OVERCOMPENSATE.

OKAY.
COME IN.

SURPRISE!

OH, LOOK SHE SURPRISED US
BACK BY COMING IN DRAG.

IRENE, YOUR CARD.

DO I HAVE THE RIGHT ROOM?

I'M LOOKING FOR
THE PRIOR SISTERS.

WE'RE THE PRIOR SISTERS,
AT LEAST, TWO OF THEM.

I'M VINCENT ANTONELLI.

I WAS YOUR FATHER'S TEACHING
ASSISTANT IN CHARLESTON.

OH, I REMEMBER, YES.

JUST BEFORE HE CAME UP
TO NEW YORK TO ACCEPT THE CHANCELLORSHIP.

I'M--
DON'T TELL ME.

OLGA, THE SERIOUS ONE.

THAT'S RIGHT.

I KNEW YOU ALL AS GIRLS.

WOW! GOOD MEMORY.

I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO LOOK YOU UP FOR YEARS.

IT'S A PLEASURE
TO RENEW YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

LIKEWISE, VINCENT.

YOU, REMEMBER MY SISTER?

DON'T TELL ME.

MARCIA.

YOU WERE THE--

THE BEAUTIFUL ONE.
YOU CAN SAY IT.

SHE'S MY SISTER,
THESE ARE OUR FRIENDS.

THANK YOU, AND WELCOME.

NO, PLEASE.
LET ME COME TO YOU.

THIS GUY'S LIKE A DAY
IN FINISHING SCHOOL.

OH, I REMEMBER YOU NOW.

YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH THAT HYSTERICAL GIRL--

THAT GIRL WHO WAS ALWAYS
PRAYING, WHAT WAS HER NAME?

YEAH. HELEN.
I MARRIED HER.

I AM SO SORRY.

IT'S TERRIBLE TO SEE CHARM
FLOUNDERING LIKE THIS.

I MEAN, NOT THAT YOU MARRIED HER
BUT FOR MY RUDE REMARK.

PLEASE, DON'T MENTION IT.

IT'S LIKE WATCHING A CAT
LOSE ITS BALANCE

AND FALL IN THE TOILET.

WE ALL SAID THAT ABOUT HELEN
BECAUSE WE HAD CRUSHES ON YOU.

I MEAN, WE DIDN'T ALL SAY IT.

COUNTERING HER INSULT
WITH CLUMSY COMPLIMENT.

OH, MY GOD.

WE HAVE TWO LOVELY LITTLE GIRLS
NOW AND I ADORE THEM.

I'M SO GLAD.

OKAY.

COME MEET OUR FRIENDS AND
FACULTY MEMBERS, PLEASE.

DOCTOR CHEBRIN, THE HEAD
OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT.

IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, DOCTOR.

OH, DON'T CALL ME DOCTOR.
I CAN'T CURE ANYTHING.

DAVID TURZIN,
PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY.

OH, PHILOSOPHY?

IS THAT AN EXPRESSION
OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL?

DAVID'S A BIT DEFENSIVE
ABOUT THE SUBJECT.

IN MATERIALISTIC SOCIETY,
QUESTIONS OF ETHICS

AND LOGIC ARE CONSIDERED
LUXURIES NO ONE CAN AFFORD.

ETHICS AND LOGIC
ARE NECESSITIES,

NOT LUXURIES IN MY LINE OF WORK.

WHAT IS YOUR LINE OF WORK
MR. ANTONELLI?

VINCENT, PLEASE.

I WORK FOR
AN IMAGE-CONSULTING FIRM.

OH, AN IMAGE CONSULTANT?

DAVID, YOU'VE FINALLY
MET SOMEONE WITH A JOB

MORE EXPENDABLE THAN YOUR OWN.

OH, VINCENT-- AND THIS
BOORISH MAN IS GARY SOKOL,

POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR.

GARY PRIDES HIMSELF
ON BEING COMPLETELY CANDID

AND IRRITATING.

MERELY EXTERNAL QUALITIES.

OUR TRUE CHARACTER LIES WITHIN,
I BELIEVE,

BEYOND OUR IMMEDIATE PERCEPTION.

IF YOU CAN'T PERCEIVE IT,
IT'S NOT THERE.

IN YOUR CASE,
I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE.

AM I INTERRUPTING
A PRIVATE PARTY?

NO, NOT AT ALL.

IT'S A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY
FOR OUR SISTER, IRENE.

IRENE?

THE BABY.

YES, STILL THE BABY.
EVEN AT 22.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

YEAH.
HAVE FUN TODAY.

THANK YOU.

IS NANCY HERE YET?

NO.
AND NEITHER IS IRENE.

IT'S IRENE'S PARTY YOU KNOW?

ANDREW.
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

GOOD.
GOOD.

PLEASE, COME MEET VINCENT
ANTONELLI FROM CHARLESTON.

CHARLESTON, THE MAGIC WORD
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER.

VINCENT WAS FATHER'S
TEACHING ASSISTANT.

DO YOU REMEMBER?

NO.

OF COURSE, YOU DON'T.
YOU WERE JUST A BOY.

I WAS MUCH OLDER.

I REMEMBER
YOU WERE ALWAYS CALLED--

THE BROTHER.

SO, THE SERIOUS ONE,
THE BABY, THE BROTHER,

AND THE BEAUTIFUL ONE.

SOUNDS LIKE MARCIA WON
THE CHARLESTON NICKNAME POOL.

WELL, WELCOME.

THANK YOU.

GENTLEMEN.

WE WERE JUST TRYING
TO CONVINCE MR. ANTONELLI

TO STAY FOR IRENE'S PARTY.

I REALLY JUST STOPPED BY
TO SAY HELLO

SINCE I'M IN TOWN ON BUSINESS.

IRENE WOULD LOVE TO MEET ANYONE
FROM CHARLESTON,

THE MYTHICAL CITY.

YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

SHE'S HEARD ALL THE STORIES
BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER ANYTHING.

SHE'S NEVER BEEN BACK?

NO, WE STILL OWN THE HOUSE
ON KING STREET,

BUT WE'VE BEEN RENTING IT OUT
FOR YEARS.

BUT AS SOON AS THE CURRENT LEASE
IS UP, WE PLAN ON MOVING BACK

AND MAKING A HOME OF IT AGAIN,
BACK TO A SIMPLER WAY OF LIFE.

DO YOU STILL LIVE THERE?

NO. NO. NO.
NOT FOR A LONG TIME.

MY COMPANY IS BASED
IN BALTIMORE.

IS THAT WHERE YOU LOST
YOUR ORIGINAL ACCENT?

NO, DOCTOR,
I'M SECOND GENERATION ITALIAN,

JUST ENOUGH TIME
TO LOSE THE OLD COUNTRY ACCENT,

NOT ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE
A SOUTHERN ONE.

THAT DIFFICULT TRANSITION
FROM IMMIGRANT TO REDNECK.

WHAT CAME NATURALLY
TO YOU IS ACTIVELY CULTIVATED

IN OUR HOUSEHOLD.

HOW DO YOU MEAN?

SOUTHERN ACCENT
STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

YOUR DADDY AFRAID YOU'D WIND UP
IN A RUSTED OUT PICK-UP TRUCK

ON TOBACCO ROAD.

PLEASE.

I APPRECIATE YOUR HUMOR,
MR. SOKOL AND LOOK FORWARD

TO DISCOVERING
YOUR OTHER POSITIVE QUALITIES.

DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

THAT WAS PARTICULARLY VICIOUS
COMING FROM AN IMAGE CONSULTANT.

AM I LATE?
IS SHE HERE YET?

OH, WHERE'S ANDREW?

YES. NO. UP THERE.

OH.

HI.

HI BABE.

HI, BABE.

NANCE, I THINK
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY.

HI, ALL AROUND.

LIKE HI RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

OH, AND THIS IS VINCENT
ANTONELLI FROM CHARLESTON.

OH.

THIS IS NANCY PECKET,
MY FIANCE.

I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

LIKEWISE.
SO, WHERE'S IRENE?

WHERE'S HARRY?

OH, HARRY, HARRY.
HARRY IS PROBABLY

WITH A PARTICULARLY CRAZY
PATIENT WHO IS EITHER HAVING

A BREAKDOWN OR A BREAKTHROUGH,
SOMEONE WHO'S JUST REALIZED

THEIR FATHER'S A BASTARD
AND THEIR MOTHER'S A BITCH.

THAT'S EITHER ELATED OR
CRESTFALLEN BY THE DISCOVERY.

WHAT?

HER HUSBAND'S A PSYCHOLOGIST.

I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

OH, DOCTOR GLASS, YOUR WIFE
CALLED WHILE YOU WERE IN SESSION.

UH-HUH.

TO REMIND YOU ABOUT HER SISTER'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS EVENING.

WHAT TIME DID
SHE SAY IT BEGINS?

FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO.

GOOD. I'M EARLY.

SO, WHAT ABOUT IRENE?

IRENE HAS A CLASS UNTIL 6:00.

IT'S 6:00 NOW.

WELL, THEY'RE NOT
BEAMING HER OVER.

IT'LL TAKE A WHILE FOR HER
TO WALK HERE.

THE CANDLES AREN'T EVEN
ON THE CAKE YET.

ANDREW, HELP ME.

NO, NO. I'LL HELP.

NO, I'M GOING.
I'M GOING.

IRENE IS A STUDENT HERE?

SHE GRADUATES THIS SPRING.

WE'RE ALL DRAWN HERE LIKE MOTHS
TO FATHER'S BIG FLAME.

HMMM.

IRENE IS AN ENGLISH MAJOR.
OLGA TEACHES ENGLISH LIT.

I MET HARRY HERE WHEN HE WAS
TAKING ONE-DAY A WEEK

FROM HIS PRACTICE TO GIVE
A LECTURE COURSE ON JUNG.

BUNCH OF BULLSHIT REALLY,
BUT I WAS TOO YOUNG

TO REALIZE IT AT THAT TIME.

ANDREW WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT
IN MUSIC

AND IS NOW
AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR.

BRAVO.

AND THAT'S HOW HE MET NANCY.

AN EXTENSION COURSE.
I WAS NOT A FULL TIME STUDENT.

NANCY THINKS THAT TAKES
THE ONUS OFF OF SCREWING THE PROFESSOR.

I WAS JUST KIDDIN'.

YOU WERE BOTH ADULTS.
WHO CARES?

THAT'S HOW I MET HARRY,
RUE THE DAY.

IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY, MARCIA.
IT'S HOW YOU SAY IT.

OH, IT'S NOT MY CONTENT
BUT MY FORM.

MAYBE, MR. ANTONELLI CAN
HELP ME POLISH UP

MY SOCIAL PRESENTATION.

START WITH ME, AND WORK YOUR WAY
UP TO MR. SOKOL.

OH, I THINK YOU'RE THE FAR
GREATER CHALLENGE THIS EVENING.

IT'S NOT YOUR FORM OR YOUR
CONTENT BUT YOUR INTENTION

THAT DISTURBS ME, MARCIA?

MY INTENTION IS MERELY
INFORMATIONAL.

I WAS JUST EXPLAINING THAT
AS A CLERK AT BERGDORF'S,

NANCY HEARD THE CALL
AND WAS MESMERIZED.

"I'M A SHOP GIRL," SHE SAID,
WITH NO TIME FOR A DEGREE.

WHY NOT TAKE
AN EXTENSION COURSE?

MARCIA.

OH, MARCIA.

I CAN TELL MY OWN STORY,
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY STORY.

OH, I THINK I CAN TELL IT
MUCH MORE INTERESTINGLY

WITH MY OBJECTIVE DISTANCE.

THAT'S WHAT
A GOOD BIOGRAPHER'S FOR, RIGHT?

FASCINATING, SHE USED ME
AS A TEMPORARY DIVERSION

TO GET HERSELF OFF THE HOT SEAT.

THEN, SHE LIFTS HER SKIRT AND
PUTS HER ASS RIGHT BACK ON IT.

MARCIA?
YES?

LET NANCY TELL IT.

WELL, WHY DON'T I TELL MY
VERSION FIRST AND WE'LL SEE

IF IT'S NOT BETTER?

THANK YOU. SO--

AFTER A LONG DAY OF SELLING
BLACK PANTYHOSE

TO MIDDLE-AGED UPPER EASTSIDE
WOMEN OBSESSED WITH CELLULITE

AND VARICOSE VEINS,

NANCY WAS ATTRACTED
TO MANHATTAN CREST COLLEGE

LIKE TRILBY TO SVENGALI, LIKE
CZARINA ALEXANDRA TO RASPUTIN.

A VOICE KEPT REPEATING
IN HER HEAD--

"I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO
GET A DEGREE, BUT I COULD TAKE

AN EXTENSION COURSE."

OH, YOU ARE SO OBNOXIOUS.

"WOW ALL THE OTHER CLERKS WITH
MY KNOWLEDGE OF GREAT MUSIC."

"SMUGLY IDENTIFYING ALL OF THE
MONTAVELLI TUNES COMING OVER THE-

REALLY MARCIA, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S COME OVER YOU LATELY

BUT, WHOO--

HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.

NANCY SEES THE FUN IN ALL THIS.

SURE, NOT SINCE HER HEAD-ON
COLLISION AS SHE HAD

SUCH  A GREAT TIME.

YOU KNOW I DON'T, MARCIA.
REALLY, I DON'T.

I'M SORRY.

YOU TELL YOUR VERSION THEN.

OH, NO, NO--
BETTER YET, YOU CAN TELL

THE STORY THAT HOW I MET HARRY
TO GET BACK AT ME.

ALL RIGHT,
LET'S STOP NOW.

YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO TELL IT?

DO YOU KNOW IT?

I THINK SO.

THEN TELL IT.

OH ENOUGH.

INVITATION DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT PSYCHODRAMA.

PERHAPS I SHOULD LEAVE,
I FEEL SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE.

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

YOU'RE ABOUT AS INCIDENTAL

AS A SPECTATOR
AT AN ANCIENT GREEK TRAGEDY.

THE PLAY IS REALLY AN OFFERING
TO THE GODS, NOT THE AUDIENCE.

GO AHEAD, NANCY,
MAKE YOUR A LITTLE OFFERING.

LET'S SEE, UH.

TERRIBLE START--JUST LAUNCH
RIGHT INTO THE NARRATIVE.

ALL RIGHT, YOU WERE A LONELY
WOMAN IN HER LATE '20s,

WHO HAD JUST
AN UNHAPPY LOVE AFFAIR,

YOUR LATEST, THAT LEFT YOU
SUICIDAL AGAIN.

I LIKE THE USE OF THE
UNFLATTERING MODIFIER FOR EMPHASIS.

VERY EFFECTIVE.

THANK YOU.

SO, NO ONE COULD CONVINCE YOU
TO GO INTO THERAPY, BUT YOU DID

AGREE TO ATTEND SOME PSYCHOLOGY
LECTURES INSTEAD.

WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
WE'RE A FAMILY OF SCHOLARS.

AND YOU MET HARRY, WHO IS
ATTRACTED TO YOU BECAUSE YOU

ARE SO FUCKED UP.

ALL RIGHT,
LET'S STOP THIS.

YES, IT'S TRUE,
I WAS FUCKED UP,

A WALKING TEXTBOOK.

HARRY LOOKED RIGHT PAST MY
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES

TO WHAT REALLY GOT HIM HOT--
A DAMAGED PSYCHE.

SO GO ON.

SO HE THOUGHT HE COULD MAKE YOU
HAPPY SO HE MARRIED YOU.

BUT INSTEAD OF MAKING YOU HAPPY,
YOU'VE MADE HIM MISERABLE

AND DEPRESSED AND YOU WON'T HAVE
ANY CHILDREN.

OH, THIS IS HORRIBLE
AND PRIMITIVE! STOP IT!

NO, ANDREW, YOU'VE GIVEN NANCY
YOUR BALLS NOW.

LET HER USE THEM.

YOU WON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN
BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO SELFISH

AND UNSTABLE AND YOU
MIGHT HURT THEM.

YOU MIGHT HURT THEM EMOTIONALLY
OR PHYSICALLY.

OH, THIS IS A MAJOR
OFFERING TO THE GODS.

THEY'LL BE BELCHING AND FARTING
THIS ONE FOR DAYS.

THERE, I THINK NANCY TOPPED
ME WITH THAT STORY.

DON'T YOU, GENTLEMEN?

DEFINITELY.

MORE PROBING, MORE VICIOUS,
ALTHOUGH ALMOST COMPLETELY

LACKING IN HUMOR, AND I THINK
NANCY WOULD EVEN AGREE

THAT SHE HAD TO BORROW
SOME OF THE THREE

AND FOUR SYLLABLE WORDS
FROM ANDREW.

A REGURGITATION
OF HIS FAMILY RUMINATIONS,

BUT A CREDITABLE ONE
WHICH NANCY MANAGED TO IMBUE

WITH HER OWN DIRECT STYLE.

BRAVA.

COME ON.

I'M NOT GOING TO PULL YOU DOWN.

THE FALL WOULDN'T KILL YOU
ANYWAY, JUST GET YOU SOME MORE

SYMPATHY FROM ANDREW.

OH, HERE SHE COMES.

QUICK HELP ME LIGHT THE CANDLES.

OH GOD, GO, GO--

HURRY UP.

SURPRISE!

SURPRISE!

YOU ALL.
I HAD A FEELING.

CALL IT A CRAZY HUNCH.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

THANK YOU.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DARLING.

OH.

YOU SWEET GIRL.

HI.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

THANK YOU.

OH, NANCY.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

OH, THANK YOU.

DR. CHEBRIN.

MANY HAPPY RETURNS,
MY DARLING.

THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

HI, DAVID.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

GEE, DAVID WHY NOT USE IRENE'S
BIRTHDAY AS AN EXCUSE TO EXPLORE

HER DIGESTIVE TRACT
WITH YOUR TONGUE.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHUT UP, GARY?

YOU'RE REALLY RUDE
AND OFFENSIVE, YOU KNOW THAT?

OF COURSE.
YOU JUST NOTICED?

OH, DAVE,
HE WAS JUST KIDDING.

NO, IRENE, IT'S BEEN HAPPENING
ALL EVENING, IT MUST BE PLANETARY.

COME, MEET OUR FRIEND, VINCENT
ANTONELLI FROM CHARLESTON.

CHARLESTON, SO MUCH FOR GETTING
A PIECE OF CAKE, ANYTIME SOON.

OH MY, IT'S A PLEASURE.

PLEASURE IS ALWAYS HIS.

THANK YOU, MR. SOKOL.

VINCENT WAS FATHER'S TEACHING
ASSISTANT IN CHARLESTON.

HE KNEW US AS GIRLS.

REALLY?

UH-HMM.

AND NANCY AND I HELPED TO FILL
HIM IN ON SOME OF OUR MOST

RECENT FAMILY HISTORY.

OKAY, ALL LIT.
COME MAKE A WISH.

OH, OKAY.

BLOW OUT THE CANDLES.
NOW, MAKE A WISH.

MAKE A WISH.

OH.

JUST BEING HERE WITH YOU ALL.

NO, NO, NO-- COME ON,
MAKE A GOOD WISH.

SOMETHING INVOLVING
MAJOR APPLIANCES OR REAL ESTATE.

WAIT, I'VE GOT IT.

YEAH.

SPEECH.

SPEECH?

OKAY, OKAY.
I KNOW I'LL ALWAYS BE THE BABY

IN THE FAMILY, BUT I'M
NOT A BABY ANYMORE.

FATHER SAID SOMETHING TO ME
WHILE WE'RE STILL IN CHARLESTON,

HE SAID, "YOUR MOST PRECIOUS
POSSESSIONS ARE YOUR FAMILY.

"THEY ARE THE SUPPORTING BEAM
OF YOUR LIFE, THEY ARE THE LIGHT

THAT GUIDES YOU, THE SACRED--"

THREE METAPHORS
AND YOU'RE OUT.

WILL YOU JUST--

NO, GARY, HE'S RIGHT.
THIS IS SO CORNY.

I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I
LOVE YOU ALL AND EVEN THOUGH

I KNOW YOU'RE ALWAYS BE
THERE TO SUPPORT ME--

LIKE A BEAM.

YOU'RE RIGHT, GARY,
LIKE A BEAM.

I WANT VERY MUCH TO BE ABLE
TO SUPPORT MYSELF AND YOU,

IF YOU NEED ME.

THAT'S IT.
THAT'S MY GOAL FOR 22.

OH, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL, BABY.

I FEEL LIKE I JUST GOT HIT
BY A STACK OF HALLMARK CARDS.

OKAY, GARY'S RIGHT, LET'S EAT.

I'LL CUT THE CAKE.

CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

SURE, SHOOT.

DOWNSTAIRS, PLEASE.

UH-OH.

EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU'RE PISSED OFF.

WHY NOT JUST BE OPEN ABOUT IT
AND GET IT OVER WITH?

NOT NOW, PLEASE.

WHAT HAPPENED?

OH, NOTHING.

YEAH, EVERYONE KNOWS
I'M PISSED OFF.

BUT THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW
PISSED OFF I AM OR HOW I'M GOING

TO EXPRESS IT AND I'D LIKE
TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU ALONE.

I'M IN TROUBLE.

DARLING, HELP ME PASS THESE OUT,

MAYBE YOU COULD PLAY
THE PIANO FOR US LATER.

YEAH.

I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY,
BUT YOU KNOW I CAN'T STAND

THAT VULGAR GIRL AND YOU INSIST
ON FOISTING HER UPON YOUR SISTERS AND ME.

I CAN NO LONGER HIDE MY TRUE
FEELINGS ABOUT HER. STOP IT.

YOU WON'T EVEN GIVE ME THE
SATISFACTION OF CHEWING YOU OUT.

WHAT ARE YOU CHASTISING ME FOR?
YOU SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING;

YOU ATTACK HER AND EMBARRASS HER
WITH YOUR VICIOUS--

I RAN OUT OF CHARM WITH HER
ALONG TIME AGO.

YOU RAN OUT OF EVERYTHING,
MARCIA, INCLUDING BASIC HUMAN DECENCY.

YOU IMPUGN MY MASCULINITY
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

WAIT UNTIL SHE FINISHES
WITH YOU.

I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU,
I WANT TO WARN YOU.

YOU SEE HER AS A GIRL, I KNOW
THE KIND OF WOMAN SHE IS,

I KNOW WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE
OF DOING TO A MAN.

AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
DOING IT TO YOUR HUSBAND

FOR FIVE YEARS.

PERHAPS.

CALL ME A BITCH,
A SHREW, A HARPY,

THAT ONE COULD GIVE ME LESSONS.

AM I TERRIBLY LATE?

CERTAINLY MISSED
ALL THE JUICY STUFF.

I'M SO SORRY.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRENE.

THANK YOU.

HAVE A PIECE OF CAKE.

I'M SORRY.

OH THANKS, BUT WHERE'S--
OH, EXCUSE ME.

I'LL BE BETTER.

I'M SORRY, ANDREW.
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME.

I TRIED TO KIND OF JUST RANDOMLY
SUCK FACE WITH YOU EARLIER BUT--

YEAH, I--
IT WAS GOOD WASN'T IT?

IT'S A BOOK--

WELL, IT IS.

DID YOU SEE THAT SAID THAT AT
THE SAME TIME WITH YOU?

I'M PSYCHIC I THINK.

AM I INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

NO, NOT AT ALL.
SHOULD WE JOIN THE OTHERS?

I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE.

HI.

SORRY I'M LATE.

I KNOW, I HEARD.

JEEZ, MARCIA, I HAD A PATIENT.

I'VE HEARD THAT TOO, YES.

HOW LATE DOES THIS GO?

YOU JUST GOT HERE.

WE HAVE THE WALDEMAN SOIREE
THIS EVENING.

WE HAVE NO SUCH THING.

I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.
YOU SAID, "YES."

HOW COULD I HAVE SAID YES?
IT'S MY SISTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

I TOLD YOU, YOU SAID,
"YES, WE'D STOP BY LATER."

NEVER.

OR MAYBE YOU'RE BLOCKING IT
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

MAYBE-- MAYBE I'M BLOCKING IT,
REPRESSING IT, DENYING IT,

SUBLIMATING IT, BUT I GUARANTEE
YOU THIS, I AM NOT GOING

TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH THOSE
TWO OSSIFIED OLD FARTS.

WAIT, THEY HEAD THE FOUNDATION,
AND THE FOUNDATION SUPPLIES

MOST OF MY REFERRALS.

OR DID YOU THINK MY PATIENTS
JUST WALK IN OFF THE STREET

WHEN THEY'RE FEELING
A LITTLE CRAZY?

I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE
AIRLIFTED FROM BELLEVUE.

I'M NOT GOING.

YOU TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MAINTAINING MY CAREER,

WHICH MAINTAINS YOUR LIFESTYLE.

WHICH MAINTAINS YOUR CAREER.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITHOUT
A WELL-DRESSED WIFE

TO DISPLAY BEFORE THAT GROUP
OF OVER-EDUCATED DULLARDS

AND CLOSET-LOONIES
YOU CALL YOUR COLLEAGUES?

IT'S SYMBIOSIS, HARRY.

BUT LET'S BREAK THE CYCLE,
SHALL WE?

YOU TAKE THE ORNAMENTATION AND
I'LL TAKE THE EVENING OFF.

YOU LOVE THESE LITTLE
SPECTACLES, DON'T YOU?

THEY VALIDATE YOU SOMEHOW.

YES, YES, AND YOU TOO.

THE KIND AND CARING DOCTOR
WITH THE MAD WIFE,

PATIENTLY ENDURING ME LIKE SOME
ONGOING HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

YOUR STATE OF MIND IS NOTHING
FOR ME TO BE PROUD OF.

IT'S A PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY
AND SO ARE YOU.

AS USUAL, YOU'VE GONE FROM
POMPOUS TO OBNOXIOUS

WITHOUT STOPPING AT AMUSING.

KEEP THESE, YOU LOSE ALL
YOUR CHARM WITHOUT THEM.

WHY DON'T YOU PLAY
SOMETHING NOW?

TAXI, TAXI.

YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW.

I WOULDN'T HAVE CONSIDERED
LEAVING YOU ALONE.

WOULDN'T YOUR WIFE
BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?

MY WIFE'S IN BALTIMORE.

UH, EXCUSE ME.

THAT WAS SHAMELESSLY COY
AND INDIRECT OF ME.

BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO.

MY WIFE WOULDN'T BE
TOO CONCERNED.

IT'S NONE OF MY
BUSINESS, REALLY.

BEARING MY EMOTIONAL SCARS IN
PUBLIC IS A DISTASTEFUL HABIT

I'VE ACQUIRED OVER THE YEARS.

I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK YOU
OR ANYONE ELSE TO DO THE SAME.

BELIEVE ME.

WHY NOT?

IT'S JUST TO SEARCH FOR
KINDREDNESS AND CONSOLATION, ISN'T IT?

WHAT A DESOLATE SADNESS TO THINK
THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

WHO SUFFERS IN MARRIAGE.

MY MARRIAGE IS
AN ABYSMAL FAILURE.

A BARELY MANAGEABLE DISASTER.

SO, WHY STAY?

WHY STAY ON?

YOU BARTER AWAY SO MANY PIECES

OF YOURSELF
IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP.

I'M NOT SURE I REMEMBER
WHICH ARE MINE

OR HOW I GO ABOUT
RECLAIMING THEM.

AND THEN, THEY'RE MY GIRLS.

THEY'RE THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE AND
I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOSE THEM.

BUT I'M SURE YOUR FATHER FELT
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU, GIRLS.

OH, YEAH. EXACTLY.

HE WANTED US WITH HIM
ALL THE TIME, REALLY,

EVERY GOD DAMN MINUTE
FOR ETERNITY.

HIS VOICE ECHOING IN OUR HEADS,
HIS PORTRAITS AND PHOTOGRAPHS

PLASTERED ON OUR WALLS.

FATHER MARCHING
THROUGH TIME WITH US.

HIS PRESENCE INDELIBLE.

I HAD NO IDEA YOU--

HATED HIM A LITTLE BIT.

IT'S ONLY NATURAL FOR A CHILD
TO RESIST AUTHORITY,

DON'T YOU THINK?

FATHER WAS THE ULTIMATE
AUTHORITARIAN,

THE DEADLIEST KIND,
THE CHARMING KIND.

THE KIND YOU WANT TO PLEASE EVEN
WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE WRONG,

AND LATER--

MARCIA?

MUCH LATER, YOU'VE REALIZED
YOU'VE VIOLATED A PART OF YOURSELF.

SO, HERE I AM.

YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH,
RESISTING MY FATHER'S AUTHORITY,

"NO DADDY, IT'S OKAY TO BE
ALONE WITH VINCENT."

"I WONT GO HOME YET."

DELAYED REACTION, HUH?

YEAH.

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

YOUR FAMILY ALWAYS SEEMED
SO HAPPY TO ME.

FOR YEARS, I THINK, I'VE HELD
YOU UP AS A KIND OF IDEAL

TO STRIVE FOR MY OWN FAMILY.

NOT AN IDEAL, AN ILLUSION.

ON THE SURFACE OF THINGS,
OF COURSE WE SEEMED HAPPY.

AFTER MOTHER DIED, WE WERE
REWARDED WITH FATHER'S APPROVAL

BY DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE
EXPECTED OF US.

FATHER WANTED HIS FIRST CHILD
TO BE A BOY,

SO OLGA GAVE UP
HER FEMININITY FOR HIM.

AND AFTER MOTHER WAS GONE I
BECAME THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE AT 13.

HOSTESSING DINNER PARTIES,
AND FACULTY GATHERINGS,

A GRACIOUS SOUTHERN BELL.

HI, HOW ARE YOU?

I REMEMBER.
IT WAS CHARMING.

IT WAS UNSAVORY.

I WAS A MIDGET SCARLET OHARA.

A CHILD PRODIGY
MARTHA STEWART.

IT TOOK ME YEARS TO REALIZE
THAT IT WASN'T ME, BUT A ROLE

I HAD ADOPTED.

I'M SO SORRY.

BUT YOU SEEMED
TO HAVE REALIZED YOURSELF.

OH YES.

AS EVIDENCED BY MY
PERFORMANCE THIS EVENING,

I'VE BECOME A MOST COMPLETELY
GRACELESS, CHARMLESS

AND TACTLESS.

HONEST, I'D CALL IT.

THANK YOU.

I SUPPOSE I FAIRED BETTER
THAN ANDREW,

WHO HAD TO HAND HIS BALLS OVER
TO FATHER.

ONLY ONE PAIR ALLOWED IN
THE HOUSE AT A TIME, YOU KNOW.

AFTER FATHER DIED ANDREW
GOT THEM BACK.

BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH,
HE KEEPS LOOKING

FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO GIVE THEM TO.

OLGA AND I PASSED THEM BACK
AND FORTH FOR A WHILE,

BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T
WANT THEM.

HE FINALLY FOUND A REAL TAKER
IN NANCY, WHO IT SEEMS

HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR AN EXTRA
PAIR FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

AND IRENE?

UH, IRENE WAS SO YOUNG
WHEN FATHER DIED.

I REALLY BELIEVE SHE HAS
EMERGED UNSCATHED.

MOST OF HER RECOLLECTIONS
OF FATHER ARE ACTUALLY STORIES

THAT OLGA AND I
REPEATED TO HER-- "FATHER'S GREATEST HITS."

OTHER THINGS WE SIMPLY INVENTED.

LIKE THE STORY SHE TOLD
OVER HER BIRTHDAY CAKE TONIGHT.

FATHER NEVER SAID THOSE THINGS
TO HER, WE DID.

WHAT? I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE'S
LOOKING OR THINKING ASKANCED AT ME.

IT'S JUST YOU PRIDE
YOURSELF ON HONESTY.

YOU'RE BRUTALLY HONEST
WITH YOURSELF.

YES, A LOT OF OTHER POOR
UNFORTUNATE SOULS.

YES-- AND YET YOU SPIN
FANTASIES FOR IRENE?

NOT FANTASIES.
SIMPLY A REFINED REALITY.

WHY NOT GIVE HER SOMETHING
SOLID TO BUILD ON.

BECAUSE IT'S IMAGINARY,
FRAGMENTARY.

ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT
A TRUE FOUNDATION.

I'M SORRY, PERHAPS
I'VE OVERSTEPPED.

NO. NO.

YOU MAYBE RIGHT, IN THEORY.

BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK

AT IRENE TO SEE THAT SHE
TURNED OUT PRETTY WELL.

YES, SHE'S A LOVELY YOUNG LADY.

IRENE.

IRENE!

SHE SEEMED TO HAVE A LOVELY TIME
TONIGHT, DON'T YOU THINK?

YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

DO YOU THINK MY ARGUMENT
WITH HARRY UPSET HER?

ACTUALLY, SHE SEEMED
RATHER USED TO IT.

OH, I SUPPOSE SHE IS.
I SUPPOSE EVERYBODY IS.

I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY ASKING
IS IF IT UPSET YOU.

IT'S ALWAYS DISTURBING
TO WITNESS AN ARGUMENT.

ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INVOLVES
SOMEONE YOU ADMIRE.

AND YOU CAN ADMIRE SOMEONE
WHO BRAWLS WITH HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC?

ARE YOU BEGGING THE COMPLIMENT?

YES. PLEASE--
ELABORATE.

ALL RIGHT.

YOUR FEELINGS TOWARDS YOUR
HUSBAND DON'T CONCERN ME.

I FIND YOU TO BE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

WITH STRONG CHARACTER.

IS THAT A LINE THAT WORKS
OFTEN IN YOUR TRAVELS?

I DON'T HAVE MUCH
OCCASION TO USE IT.

OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME
TO BE FRANK.

I DO. I DID. I GUESS I'M
JUST NOT VERY COMFORTABLE

WITH YOUR FEELINGS OR MINE.

I HAVEN'T FLIRTED
WITH A MAN IN YEARS.

MY RESPONSES ARE THOSE
OF A COQUETTE FROM ANOTHER ERA.

I HAVE SEEN WOMAN
OUTSIDE MY MARRIAGE.

BUT MY MARRIAGE IS NOT
A HAPPY ONE.

SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY
YOU WANT TO GET LAID.

I'M SORRY, I'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
IT'S JUST A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

IT SOUNDS LIKE A CLICHE USED
BY ANY MAN ON THE MAKE.

BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE.

I'M A LONELY MAN
IN A BAD MARRIAGE.

PLEASE, I SAID I WAS SORRY.

AND I ASSURE YOU, PICKING UP
WOMEN FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES

IS NEVER THIS SOUL WRENCHING
OR TIME CONSUMING.

I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
TO APOLOGIZE, THANK YOU,

OR BE INSULTED.

WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
THIS IS NOT JUST A SEXUAL THING.

DO YOU REALIZE THAT?

HM?

AND IS THE FEELING MUTUAL?

IS IT?

OKAY.
OKAY.

SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?

GO HOME?

I'M REALLY JUST A GOOD GIRL
WHO'S MORE COMFORTABLE FIGHTING

WITH HER HUSBAND
THAN CHEATING ON HIM.

I GUESS I'D RATHER BE A BITCH
THAN A SLUT.

DOES CARING FOR SOMEONE
MAKE YOU A SLUT?

NO.

EXPRESSING IT DOES.

WE COULD SHARE A CAB.

WOULD YOU MIND DROPPING ME
AT MY PLACE?

I INSIST ON IT.

DON'T BE AFRAID.

I'M NOT,

BUT I AM AFRAID.

MY GOD, WE'VE BEEN CALLING
FOR YOU EVERYWHERE.

WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHERE'S ANDREW?

HE'S AT THE HOSPITAL.

WHAT HAPPENED?
IS HE HURT?

IT'S IRENE, A DRUG OVERDOSE.

WHAT?
OH NO! OH MY GOD!

SHE COULD HAVE DIED.

FOR GOD'S SAKE,
NOBODY WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

SHE COULD HAVE DIED ALL ALONE
WITH STRANGERS AROUND HER.

IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW
WE'RE HERE NOW.

WHAT HAPPENED,
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

SHE'S FINE NOW.
SHE'S RESTING.

WHERE IS SHE?

WHERE WERE YOU?

I WAS STILL AT THE COLLEGE,
I TOLD YOU TO I HAD TO CLEAN UP.

FOR TWO HOURS?

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
WE'RE ALL HERE NOW.

SHE'S IN THERE, THE OTHER NURSE
IS GIVING HER SOME MEDICATION.

HAVE YOU SEEN HER YET?

WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

WHAT, WHAT, WHY CAN'T
I SEE HER?

JUST A FEW MINUTES.
LET HER GET SETTLED.

WE SAW HER BEFORE IN EMERGENCY
BEFORE THEY BROUGHT HER UP.

IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
IS SHE IN PAIN?

SHE COULD HAVE DIED.

WOULD YOU STOP PUNISHING ME
AND JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

SHE WAS HAVING
RESPIRATORY FAILURE.

THE DOCTOR SAID IF THEY'D FOUND
HER A FEW MINUTES LATER,

SHE WOULD HAVE GONE
INTO CARDIAC ARREST.

OKAY.
WHO FOUND HER?

I DID.

I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HER
GETTING HOME ALL RIGHT AFTER

THE PARTY, SO I FOLLOWED HER
TO YOUR APARTMENT AND--

SHE COLLAPSED BY THE ELEVATOR--
IF DAVID HADN'T FOUND HER...

WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT?
WHAT WAS IT?

SHE TOLD THE DOCTOR
IT WAS CRYSTAL METH, SPEED.

WHAT?

MAYBE SHE WAS EXPERIMENTING.

MAYBE SHE USED IT TO STUDY
FOR EXAMS.

SHE'S BEEN MAIN LINING IT
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

SHE HAS NEEDLE MARKS
ON BOTH HER ARMS.

NO, ANDREW,
I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.

WE SAW THEM, MARCIA.

SHE'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

THE IMPORTANT THING
IS SHE GOT HERE IN TIME.

THANK YOU, VINCENT.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

AND THANK YOU, DAVID,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

YES, THANK YOU, DAVID.

PLEASE--I'M JUST SO
GRATEFUL I WAS THERE.

IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

YES, AND SHE LIKE TO SEE YOU,

BUT NO MORE THAN TWO
AT A TIME PLEASE.

FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES.

OLGA, YOU GO WITH HER.

CAN SHE COME HOME
WITH US TONIGHT?

THE DOCTOR WOULD LIKE
TO KEEP HER OVERNIGHT.

OKAY.

OH, MY DARLING.

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

I'M SORRY.

NO, SHHH.
JUST RELAX.

AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,
YOU'LL BE JUST FINE.

"SLEEP THAT KNITS UP
THE RAVELED SLEEVE OF CARE."

OH, I GOT YOUR TOOTHBRUSH
DOWNSTAIRS.

THANK YOU.

WHY HAVEN'T YOU ASKED ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

DAVID TOLD US.

DAVID?
WHAT DOES DAVID KNOW?

WELL, HE FOLLOWED YOU HOME
TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE ALL RIGHT,

AND WHEN YOU COLLAPSED
IN THE LOBBY, HE AND THE BUILDING MANAGER--

DAVID WAS FOLLOWING ME?

THAT'S WEIRD.

HE HELPED YOU DARLING.
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.

YES, I AM GRATEFUL
AND SURPRISED.

DAVID TAKES A BROTHERLY
INTEREST IN YOU.

HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF
ONE OF THE FAMILY.

I HAVE A FAMILY
AND I DON'T NEED A CHAPERONE.

APPARENTLY, YOU DO.

NO, I DON'T.

WHAT I DO ALONE IS MY BUSINESS.

THAT IS A STUPID
AND CHILDISH THING TO SAY.

APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S TREATED LIKE A CHILD.

I'M LYING IN THE HOSPITAL
AFTER A DRUG OVERDOSE.

YOU HAND ME A TOOTHBRUSH.

AND WHEN I ASK YOU IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

YOU SAY DAVID TOLD YOU.

WHAT DO YOU THINK DAVID KNOWS
ABOUT MY LIFE?

WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME?

I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU.

YOU NEVER WANT TO UPSET ME.

ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO READ YOUR MIND?

YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK TO US
ABOUT ANYTHING.

AS LONG AS IT FEEDS THE PERCEPTION
OF ME THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

IS THIS SOMEHOW OUR FAULT?
IS THAT IT?

NO.

NO.

IT'S MY FAULT I'M ON DRUGS.

YOU'RE NOT.

IT'S YOUR FAULT
YOU CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

SHH, STOP OKAY.
YOU'RE JUST TIRED.

DO YOU SEE?

YOU'LL BE TELLING PEOPLE
I HAD A LITTLE FAINTING SPELL

LIKE SOME OVERWROUGHT
SOUTHERN LADY.

WHERE IS SHE?

SHE'S ALL RIGHT, SHE'S IN THERE
WITH OLGA AND MARCIA.

SHE JUST NEEDS SOME REST.

DR., I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO COME TO THE HOSPITAL.

I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR MARCIA.

HOW COULD I NOT COME?

SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

SHE OVERDOSED ON CRYSTAL METH.

APPARENTLY IT WAS ACCIDENTAL.

YEAH, TELL THAT ONE
TO DR. FREUD.

YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR SARCASM
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN YOU?

GEE DAVE, I HATE TO SHATTER
YOUR NORMAN ROCKWELL VIEW

OF THE WORLD, BUT PEOPLE WHO
DRUG THEMSELVES TO OVERDOSE

ARE TRYING TO KILL THEMSELVES.

AND WHO ARE YOU TO ASSIGN
MOTIVES TO HER.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HER?

MORE THAN YOU COULD HANDLE.

EVERYTHING SEEMS WARPED
FROM WHERE YOU STAND,

BUT THE DISTORTION
IS INTERNAL, NOT EXTERNAL.

STOP ARGUING.

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TWO?
YOU'RE GOOD FRIENDS FOR GOD'S SAKE.

YOU'RE BOTH TIRED AND UPSET.

IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

HOW'D SHE GET HERE?

DAVID FOUND HER IN HER APARTMENT
LOBBY AND CALLED THE PARAMEDICS.

WHAT WAS DAVID DOING
IN HER APARTMENT LOBBY?

I WALKED HER HOME.

SHE LEFT THE PARTY BY HERSELF--

AND I FOLLOWED HER TO MAKE SURE
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.

WHAT, DO YOU HAVE SOME
SIXTH SENSE ABOUT POTENTIAL DRUG OVERDOSES?

LOOKING AFTER SOMEONE MUST BE AN
INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONCEPT TO YOU.

DON'T DIGNIFY YOUR PERVERSIONS
TO ME, YOU CREEP.

HEY.

HEY, HEY, HEY!

HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

PLEASE.

UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO LEAVE, GARY.

OH REALLY, ANDREW?

WHAT ARE YOU THE HOSPITAL
BOUNCER NOW?

ANDREW? ANDREW,
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

NOTHING.
DR. CHEBRIN AND GARY ARRIVED.

EVERYONE'S VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT IRENE.

HOW IS SHE?

DR. CHEBRIN, SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU.

I THINK IT WAS THE PRESSURE
OF FINALS.

I THINK SHE WAS JUST TRYING
TO RELEASE THE PRESSURE.

ARE YOU A SPIN DOCTOR NOW?

TAKING IMAGE CONSULTING
FROM MR. ANTONELLI HERE--

WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?

EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO DISTORT
THINGS FOR OUR FRIENDS, OLGA.

YEAH, WE'RE ALL FAMILY HERE.

EVEN MR. ANTONELLI KNEW YOU AS CHILDREN
AND HE'S GOTTEN MUCH CLOSER THIS EVENING.

EXCUSE ME, IRENE PRIOR.

HER FAMILY'S
IN THE WAITING ROOM THERE.

THANKS.

IS SHE ALL RIGHT.

SHE'S RESTING.

WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

SHE OVERDOSED ON CRYSTAL METH.
DAVID FOUND HER.

AFTER LURKING ABOUT
FOR A FEW HOURS--

WOULD YOU SHUT UP.

--WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO
ASSERT HIS FRAGILE MASCULINITY.

HAVE YOU BOTH GONE CRAZY?

HE SAYS THAT TO EVERYONE HOPING
TO INCREASE HIS BUSINESS.

EVERYONE'S NERVES ARE A LITTLE
FRAYED THAT'S ALL.

YEAH, THIS ONE'S OUT OF HIS
FUCKING MIND TONIGHT.

SHE OVERDOSED, DAVID FOUND HER,
THAT'S IT?

YOU GET HERE LATE,
YOU GET A SHORT SYNOPSIS.

THE HEART OF CONCERN.

I'M ASKING ABOUT
YOUR GOD DAMN SISTER.

PLEASE DON'T START THIS HERE.

YOU LEFT MY GOD DAMN SISTER'S PARTY
TO GO TO THE GOD DAMN WALDEMAN'S.

SO DON'T COME STROLLING IN HERE
AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR

WITH YOUR PROFESSIONAL ARROGANCE
AND YOUR RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION

EXPECTING ORAL REPORTS
FROM ALL THE LAYPERSONS.

YOU'RE NOT THE DOCTOR HERE, HARRY,
ONLY ANOTHER GUY WHO MISSED THE SHOW.

MARCIA WAS A LITTLE LATE HERSELF
IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER.

NOT AS GOOD AS IT MAKES
YOU FEEL.

ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO SEE MY SISTER.

IS SHE STILL AWAKE?

YEAH.

EVERYBODY ON THIS FLOOR'S
AWAKE NOW.

DO YOU WANT TO COME
WITH ME, DOCTOR?

OH, HE'S HALF ASLEEP AND HALF
DRUNK; THAT'S ALL SHE NEEDS.

REALLY, GARY, IS NO ONE EXEMPT
FROM THESE LITTLE CA-CAS

YOU SEEM COMPELLED
TO MAKE IN PUBLIC.

JUST GIVE HER SOME PRIVACY,
THAT'S ALL.

NANCE?
DOCTOR?

I--I'LL STAY OUT HERE.
JUST GIVE HER MY LOVE.

ALL RIGHT.

OH, HARRY.
THIS IS VINCENT ANTONELLI.

HE'S A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.

FEELING ANY BETTER?

YEAH.

OH GOD, WE WERE SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, BUT YOU LOOK GREAT.

REALLY GREAT.

I MEAN YOU'RE A LITTLE PALE,

BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT
OF HERE TOMORROW AND

THEN YOU ARE GONNA
FEEL, YOU KNOW, GREAT.

THANKS, NANCY.

CAN WE GET YOU ANYTHING?

NO. THANK YOU.

WELL MY DARLING, I THINK
I'LL GO HOME.

WHAT GOOD IS AN OLD MAN
IN A CRISIS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

IT'LL MEAN SO MUCH TO IRENE
TO KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

WHO KNOWS ANYTHING?

THIS WHOLE THING
MAY HAVE BEEN A DREAM.

WE MAY ALL WAKE UP TOMORROW
HAVING HAD THE SAME BAD DREAM.

APPARENTLY METAPHYSICS ARE GOING
TO SAVE US FROM THIS ONE.

CAN I WALK YOU DOWNSTAIRS,
DOCTOR?

HE'S GOOD AT THAT.

UH, NO THANK YOU MY BOY.
I GET IN AN ELEVATOR.

I GET IN A CAB.
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

YOU'RE MOTHER MUST HAVE DROPPED
YOU WHEN YOU WERE A BABY,

AND SOMETHING BROKE IN HERE.

THOUGH NEVER LITERALLY,
I'VE BEEN DROPPED A FEW TIMES, DOCTOR.

IT SHOWS.

GOODNIGHT.
GOODNIGHT. GOODNIGHT.

HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU GOING
TO STAY?

I DON'T KNOW.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IN FACT, PLEASE DON'T.

I DON'T WANT YOU LEAVING HERE
ALONE AT A LATE HOUR.

OH, PLEASE--
ALL THIS OBLIGATORY GALLANTRY IS TIRESOME.

YOU KNOW I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

WHAT I KNOW IS THAT YOUR
DEFENSIVE SKILLS ARE MOSTLY VERBAL.

ANDREW AND I WILL DROP HER OFF.

OR I'D BE HAPPY TO SEE HER HOME.

I SEE.

WHAT BETTER PROTECTION
THAN NOSTALGIA PERSONIFIED.

GOODNIGHT.

GOODNIGHT.

ANDREW, YOU KNOW WHAT
I WOULD LIKE?

WHAT? YOU TELL ME;
I'LL CALL THE NURSE.

NO, SHE CAN'T GIVE IT TO ME.

I WANT TO GO BACK TO CHARLESTON
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

ALL OF US.

SPEND SOME TIME IN THE HOUSE,
INHABIT OUR OLD SPACE,

FIND OUR OLD SOULS.

YOU THINK WE COULD DO THAT?

SURE, I THINK WE COULD, YEAH.

THE CURRENT LEASE IS UP
ON THE HOUSE IN A FEW MONTHS

AND AS SOON AS THE TENANTS ARE
OUT, WE COULD FLY DOWN, YEAH.

OR MAYBE WE COULD DRIVE DOWN
AND SEE THE COUNTRYSIDE.

OH, I'D LIKE THAT--
SEE THE LEAVES CHANGING.

STOP AT FARMERS' MARKETS
AND ANTIQUE SHOPS ALONG THE WAY.

SOUNDS LOVELY.

WE'LL MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
WHEN YOU FEEL BETTER.

YOU GET SOME REST NOW.

I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU UP,
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO.

WOULD YOU LIKE DAVID TO COME IN
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP

JUST SO THAT YOU
COULD THANK HIM?

OH.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

NO.
I--I SHOULD.

YEAH, PLEASE ASK HIM TO COME IN.

ALL RIGHT.
GOODNIGHT.

YOU'LL BE MY SHINY NEW PENNY
IN THE MORNING AGAIN.

THANK YOU.

YES, GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
AND THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE--

I KNOW--
"GREAT."

YEAH.

OKAY.

I NEED TO GO CALL
MY WIFE AND KIDS.

OH, VINCENT I'M SO SORRY.

HOW INSENSITIVE OF ME.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY HERE
WITH ME.

I KNOW, YOU'RE SELF-SUFFICIENT.
I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.

UH, IRENE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT, DAVID.

THAT GUY GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

HE JUST HAS A HARD TIME
EXPRESSING HIMSELF.

HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF TOO WELL,
IF YOU ASK ME.

IT'S OKAY, DAVID.
YOU CAN COME IN.

HOW ARE YOU?

I'M ALL RIGHT NOW.
PLEASE COME IN.

DAVID, WHAT'S WRONG?

I WAS JUST--
SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

THERE WAS AN INCIDENT,
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO IT.

HELEN, HELEN--
I CALLED AS SOON AS I COULD.

WHAT WAS WITH
THAT ROADTRIP CRAP?

SHE'S JUST FEELING
A LITTLE SENTIMENTAL.

MENTAL IS MORE LIKE IT.

I MEAN, IMAGINE BEING IN A CAR
WITH YOUR SISTERS

ALL THE WAY TO CHARLESTON.
SOMEBODY WOULD GET THERE DOA.

HELEN, I HAVE TO GO NOW, OKAY?
JUST TELL THE GIRLS I LOVE THEM.

WHY WOULD SHE DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

AND HOW COULD WE NOT KNOW
ABOUT IT?

WE ALL CARRY OUR SECRETS,
I GUESS.

DON'T WE HAVE SECRETS FROM HER?

YOU?
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

YOU TELL EVERYBODY EVERYTHING.

RIGHT.

LOOK, IF THERE'S MORE.
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

I KNOW.
YOU NEVER DID.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

NOTHING.

I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

I KNOW HOW YOU HATE THAT.

OH.
PLEASE CONTINUE.

DON'T SPARE ME.

TELL ME HOW I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL TURMOIL,

YOUR BAD MARRIAGE.

IT'S NOT WHAT DO YOU THINK.

I DON'T NEED THIS.

GO HOME AND DO THIS
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

YOU'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?

YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
WHEN I MARRIED HIM

THAT IT WOULD SOLVE
ALL OUR PROBLEMS.

OUR PROBLEMS?

WHAT FATHER DID TO ME
IS YOUR PROBLEM, TOO, OLGA.

AND IN SOME STRANGE WAY, I THINK
IT'S EVEN BECOME IRENE'S.

WELL, IF SPEWING VITRIOL
FOR ETERNITY

IS YOUR WAY OF COMING TO TERMS
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,

THEN IT'S BECOME EVERYONE'S--

IT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,
IT'S WHAT FATHER DID TO ME.

ALL RIGHT.
I ACCEPTED THAT A YEAR AGO.

I BELIEVED YOU
EVEN THOUGH FATHER

WASN'T HERE TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

YOU INSULT ME IN SO MANY
SUBTLE WAYS

AS IF I WAS FATHER'S
POSTHUMOUS PERSECUTOR.

WHAT IS THE POINT
IN GOING OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

IT'S NOT FINISHED.

IT'S NEVER FINISHED
UNTIL YOU ACCEPT IT.

I TOLD YOU I DID.
BUT I LOVED HIM.

HE WAS MY FATHER, AND HE NEVER
DID THOSE THINGS TO ME.

EXACTLY.

HE DIDN'T DO THOSE
THINGS TO YOU.

STOP IT NOW, MARCIA.

I HEAR SOMEONE, FATHER.

THERE IS NO ONE.
NO ONE.

WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

IT MEANS YOU KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING TO ME

LONG BEFORE I TOLD YOU.

WHILE YOU WERE A CHILD,
WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING.

THAT IS A LIE.

AND ON SOME LEVEL
YOU WERE JEALOUS.

AND YOU HAVE LIVED--

YOU'RE SO TWISTED.

YOU HAVE LIVED WITH A JEALOUSY,
AND THOSE FEELINGS

OF INADEQUACY FOR YEARS,
IT'S CREATED A BARRIER

BETWEEN YOU AND IRENE,
YOU AND ME, AND YOU AND YOURSELF.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

IF VINCENT IS SEEING YOU HOME,
I MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE.

PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

FOR IRENE, IF NOT FOR ME.

WE REALLY HAVEN'T GIVEN HER
THE FOUNDATION SHE SPOKE OF TONIGHT.

IT'S A QUICKSAND OF MYTHS
AND HALF-TRUTHS.

YOU AND I HAVE LEARNED
TO LIVE WITH IT

WITH ENOUGH SUCCESS TO GET BY--
A BITTER FRUSTRATED WOMAN

EXERCISING HER DEMONS
WITH VERBAL ASSAULTS

AND A CLOSET LESBIAN, TRYING
TO BE THE FATHER SHE LOVED AND HATED.

MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION
IS MY BUSINESS,

AS A NECESSARY SECRET
FOR A SCHOOLTEACHER.

YOU WANT TO THINK SO?

BUT WHY HAVE YOU NEVER
SHARED IT WITH IRENE,

AND ONLY BY INFERENCE WITH ME?

WHY SHOULD I? WHY EXPOSE
MYSELF TO YOUR POP-PSYCHOLOGY?

POOR OLGA HAS TO BE HER FATHER, BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T LOVE HER ENOUGH TO MOLEST HER?

BULLSHIT.

IS IT?

YES, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
MY COMPLEXITIES

ENOUGH TO ANALYZE
AND CATEGORIZE ME.

ALL RIGHT,
THEN SHARE THEM WITH ME.

LET ME SEE YOU.

I DON'T KNOW.

I DON'T KNOW
IF I TRUST YOU ENOUGH.

HOW IS SHE NOW, DAVID?

FINE.
SHE'S GOING TO SLEEP.

SHOULD WE LOOK IN ON HER?

NO.

JUST LET HER REST.
WE'LL SEE HER IN THE MORNING.

DON'T SAY GOOD NIGHT.
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

I WASN'T SAYING GOOD NIGHT.

COME, DAVID.
LET'S GO HOME.

I LOVE YOU.

WITH THIS RING AND ALL THAT I AM
AND ALL THAT I HAVE,

I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU.

ANDREW AUGUSTUS, WITH THIS RING
AND ALL THAT I AM

AND ALL THAT I HAVE,
I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU.

AS YOU HAVE PLEDGED
YOUR LIFE-LONG COMMITMENT,

I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

THOSE WHOM GOD HAS JOINED
TOGETHER LET NO ONE SEPARATE.

ANDREW, YOU MAY KISS YOUR BRIDE.

UH, A MAN IN TRIBECA CUT OFF
HIS BEST FRIEND'S THUMB

FOR BEATING HIM
AT A GAME OF PINBALL.

HIS BEST FRIEND, HIS THUMB.

UH, A WOMAN IN RIVERDALE
WAS RAPED BY A MAN WITH WHOM

SHE HAD REFUSED TO GO TO THE
HIGH SCHOOL PROM 10 YEARS AGO.

IMAGINE CARRYING THAT KIND OF
RESENTMENT AROUND FOR 10 YEARS.

UHHH, THREE CARMELITE NUNS
IN BROOKLYN--

WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

HUH, WHAT?

I DON'T GIVE
A CONTORTIONIST'S FUCK

ABOUT THREE CARMELITE NUNS
IN BROOKLYN.

I WASN'T EVEN
TALKING TO YOU, GARY.

WELL, I'M THE ONLY ONE
UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE SHARING

THIS ROOM WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

I WAS READING TO MYSELF.

AT 50 DECIBELS?

YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT CALLED
THE "READING OUT LOUD ROOM"

OR THE "ATROCITIES ROOM,"

IT'S CALLED THE "FACULTY LOUNGE,"
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LOUNGE.

WHY DON'T YOU GRADE
YOUR PAPERS IN YOUR OFFICE?

BECAUSE I AM NOT
DISTURBING ANYONE.

IF YOU HAVEN'T MASTERED
SILENT READING SKILLS,

WHY DON'T YOU GO TO YOUR OFFICE?

THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

WHAT? WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU UNDERSTAND, OLD MAN?

YOUR SHORT TEMPER
AND YOUR POOR MANNERS,

I SHOULD SAY SHORTER AND POORER.

I UNDERSTAND WHERE'S
THIS COMING FROM, "OLD MAN".

REALLY?
ENLIGHTEN ME.

PERHAPS A CERTAIN JEALOUSY OVER
A CERTAIN YOUNG LADY'S INTEREST

IN A CERTAIN OTHER YOUNG MAN.

OR HIS IN HER.

WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?
YOU STUPID OLD FOOL.

YOU SHIT.

WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

NOTHING, I JUST DROPPED A BOOK.

FIFTEEN-FOOT GRAVITY
DEFYING DROP.

I'LL BE SURE TO CALL RIPLEY'S
WHEN I GET BACK TO MY OFFICE.

YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME.

AND WATCH YOU BECOME
ONE OF YOUR PRECIOUS HEADLINES.

"UH, ENGLISH PROFESSOR
KILLED  BY FLYING POLITICAL SCIENCE TEXT."

I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU
THE POST MORTEM SATISFACTION.

SHEESH.

I'VE GOT PAPERS TO GRADE.

WELL, DON'T LET US
FORCE YOU OUT.

I WORK BETTER IN MY OFFICE.

WELL, WHY DON'T YOU STAY
AND JOIN US.

WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE PARTY.

OH, REALLY?

ANOTHER SOUL STRIPPING TRIBAL
DANCE BY THE PRIOR FAMILY,

WHAT'S THE SPECIAL OCCASION?

IT'S A BABY SHOWER
FOR ANDREW AND NANCY.

OH GOD, HAVE THEY
PERFORMED AMNIOCENTESIS

TO FIND OUT WHAT SPECIES
IT'S GOING TO BE?

MR. SOKOL, I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU RESPONDING TO AN INVITATION

BY INSULTING ALL OF THE MEMBERS
OF MY FAMILY INCLUDING THE UNBORN.

YOU THINK BEING CHANCELLOR
ENTITLES YOU

TO GIVE ME LESSONS
IN DEPORTMENT?

YES, AND I WON'T HAVE YOU
THROWING BOOKS

AT OTHER TEACHERS.

THE FUHRER MEETS EMILY POST.

HEIL!

I'LL BE SURE TO STOP BY LATER
FOR SOME PRACTICAL LESSONS

IN BEHAVIOR FROM THE REST
OF THE FAMILY.

GRR.

INSUFFERABLE LITTLE MAN,
HE ALMOST BEGS ME TO FIRE HIM.

OH, HE DOESN'T CARE,
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

WHY NOT?

WHAT TRAGEDY IN HIS LIFE HAS DESTROYED
HIS MECHANISM FOR SELF-PRESERVATION?

HE SIMPLY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
THE SAME THINGS MOST PEOPLE CARE ABOUT.

MAYBE HE CARES TOO MUCH.

DID HE HURT YOU DOCTOR?

NO, NO.
HE'S NOT ANGRY AT ME.

I'M JUST A CONVENIENT TARGET.

WHO IS IT THEN?
HUMANITY IN GENERAL?

IT'S MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT.

IT'S ME, ISN'T IT?

YOU? WHY WOULD HE
BE ANGRY WITH YOU?

IT IS ME, ISN'T IT DOCTOR?

OH, YOU COULD ONLY BE THE OBJECT OF
LOVE TO ANY MAN, MY DARLING, NOT ANGER.

NO, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
HE'S INCAPABLE OF LOVE.

EVERY MAN HAS SILENT DREAMS THAT
HE DOESN'T SHARE WITH THE WORLD.

DELICATE LONGINGS
THAT HE FEARS WILL BE SHATTERED

BY RIDICULE AND SO WHY SHOULD
GARY BE IMMUNE TO SUCH FEELINGS?

BECAUSE HE SHOUTS?
MAKES SNIDE REMARKS?

THOSE ARE NOT HIS EMOTIONS,
THEY ARE HIS HIDING PLACE.

SO THE OBJECT OF LOVE
BECOMES THE OBJECTS OF SCORN?

THE OBJECT OF YOUR LOVE BECOMES
THE OBJECT OF HIS SCORN.

DAVID.

UH-HMM.

HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS, DOCTOR?

I KNOW NOTHING MORE
THAN YOU DO, MY DEAR.

I SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH
WHEN IT PRESENTS ITSELF TO ME.

FORGIVE ME, SWEETHEART, I HAVE
SOME PAPERS I HAVE TO ATTEND TO.

OH, WON'T YOU STAY
FOR THE PARTY, DOCTOR.

NOTHING ELABORATE, JUST A TOAST
TO ANDREW AND NANCY.

PERHAPS, I NEVER OLD YOU THIS,
BUT I DESPISE THAT WOMAN.

OH, SO DO WE ALL, BUT,
BUT PLEASE, PLEASE COME FOR OUR SAKE.

WE NEED GOOD SPIRITS WHEN SHE'S
AROUND, LIKE AT AN EXORCISM.

I WILL DROP BY, MAKE A TOAST
TO EVOLUTION.

IN NANCY'S CASE,
IT'S A DAMN NECESSITY.

CIAO.

YOU KNOW, I THINK
I FORGOT SOME THINGS.

DO YOU WANT TO RUN
TO THE MARKET WITH ME?

SURE.

THESE FALL DAYS
ARE SO PRECIOUS, AREN'T THEY?

WE NEVER KNOW HOW MANY
WE HAVE LEFT UNTIL WINTER.

DAVID AND GARY
WERE GOOD FRIENDS.

DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

I'D HATE TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HOSTILITY BETWEEN THEM.

HOSTILITY?

WHAT COULD HAPPEN BETWEEN
TWO CIVILIZED EDUCATED MEN,

A CHESS MATCH TO THE DEATH?
PLEASE, DON'T BE MORBID.

OH.

BUT IT ISN'T AS IF DAVID AND I
WERE THE ROMANCE OF THE CENTURY.

WHAT'S THERE TO BE
SO JEALOUS OF?

YOU'RE ENGAGED TO THE MAN, DEAR.
AREN'T YOU?

YES.

SO, GARY IS OUT OF LUCK,
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT,

UNLESS YOU'RE NOT REALLY
COMMITTED TO THIS ENGAGEMENT.

OH, OF COURSE, I AM.
I AM.

BUT THE INTENSITY
OF MY FEELINGS--

NOBODY KNOWS THE INTENSITY  OF
YOUR FEELINGS AND NOBODY SHOULD.

IT'S NOT PUBLISHED
WITH THE MARRIAGE BANDS.

SO, DON'T EXPECT GARY
TO BE LESS JEALOUS,

BECAUSE YOU DON'T LOVE DAVID AS
MUCH AS YOU THINK YOU SHOULD.

AS MUCH AS HE LOVES ME?

SOMEHOW, OVER TIME
IT EQUALIZES ITSELF.

LOVE IS NEVER THE WAY
IT'S PRESENTED IN FICTION.

WE ARRIVE AT IT
WITH SO LITTLE EXPERIENCE

AND SO MANY FALSE EXPECTATIONS,
DON'T AGONIZE OVER IT, TRUST YOUR DECISION.

BUT IT ISN'T ME
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ANYMORE.

I'M NOT EXPECTING
A WHITE KNIGHT.

IT'S DAVID--HE DESERVES BETTER.

DAVID HAS DONE QUITE WELL FOR
HIMSELF, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

HE'S WON A PRIZE WITH YOU.

HE'S GRABBED THE RING
ON THE CAROUSEL.

BRASS, NO TIMBRE, NO SPARKLE.

I'M SETTLING FOR SECURITY
WITH HIM AND HE KNOWS IT.

HOW DOES HE KNOW IT?

I TOLD HIM.

DARLING, DISCRETION IS CALLED FOR,
EVEN IN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS.

DON'T MAKE HONESTY AN EXCUSE
FOR UNBURDENING YOURSELF

OF UNWANTED THOUGHTS
AND EMOTIONS.

THAT'S WHAT YOUR SISTER DOES,
AND HER MARRIAGE HAS BECOME A SIDESHOW.

THANK YOU.

MARCIA.

STOP.

I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HELEN
TODAY--AN UNPLEASANT ONE.

ABOUT US?

YEAH.

WHAT ABOUT US?

I COULDN'T START OUR LIFE
TOGETHER WITH A LIE.

WHAT IS THE TRUTH, ANYWAY?

SOMETIMES IT'S JUST
A VERBALIZATION

OF OUR SURFACE INSECURITIES AND FEARS, BUT
ONCE SPOKEN THE WORDS DEFINE A REALITY.

THAT IS THE REALITY
I NEED TO INHABIT RIGHT NOW.

OLGA, I'M IN RECOVERY.

I'M FIGHTING TO STAY OUT OF THAT WORLD
OF DRUGS AND DELUSIONS THAT I INHABITED.

AND HONEST WORDS,
NO MATTER HOW IMPERFECT,

ARE MY ONLY TOOL
FOR GETTING BACK

AND FOR KEEPING
MY WORLD STRAIGHT.

CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

YES.

WE WANT TO MOVE
TO CHARLESTON.

CHARLESTON?

WHY NOT?
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT ALL THESE YEARS.

DAVID CAN GET A JOB IN THE PHILOSOPHY
DEPARTMENT AT THE COLLEGE.

WE CAN STAY IN THE HOUSE.

THAT IS, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU AND MARCIA AND ANDREW.

YES, YES OF COURSE, WHY NOT?

THE CURRENT LEASE IS UP IN A
MONTH OR TWO; YOU COULD MOVE IN,

MAKE A REAL HOME OF IT AGAIN.

COMPLETE THE SISTERS
WHO VISIT AND STAY TOO LONG.

NO.
NEVER TOO LONG.

OH, MY GOD.
RIGHT IN THE COURTYARD.

HOW INDISCREET?

NO, SOMETHING'S WRONG.

VINCENT'S LEAVING TODAY.

FOR WHERE?

WHERE DOESN'T MATTER,
WHY IS THE QUESTION.

BALTIMORE.
MY WORK HERE IS FINISHED.

HIS WORK HAS VERY
LITTLE TO DO WITH IT.

WHAT, YOU'RE STILL HERE?

WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?

NEVER.
HE'S NEVER COMING BACK.

AT LEAST NOT TO ME, NOT TO US.

MARCIA.

I'M SORRY.
MAYBE I WAS WRONG.

WAS I--WAS I WRONG?
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.

ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD.

THIS WASN'T MY IDEA.

IF THIS HAS TO END WITH OPEN
WOUNDS FOR YOU, GO AHEAD.

ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T--
IT WASN'T VINCENT'S EITHER.

IT WAS HIS POOR CRAZY
WIFE'S IDEA.

YOU DON'T MIND
IF I CALL HER THAT DO YOU.

IT SEEMS THAT CRAZY HELEN
WAS PRAYING ONE DAY

AND GOD TOLD HER TO TAKE
HER TWO LITTLE GIRLS

AWAY FROM THEIR SLUT
MONGERING FATHER.

SO, IT WAS REALLY GOD'S IDEA.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MAKES ME?

EVEN A CERTIFIABLE LOONY
LIKE HELEN WOULD WIN CUSTODY

OF THE GIRLS IN A DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS WHAT WOULD VINCENT

HAVING BOFFED ME A FEW TIMES
A WEEK FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW.

BETTER A CRAZY MOTHER
THAN A CORRUPT FATHER, I GUESS.

MARCIA STOP THIS.

END IT WITH SOME DIGNITY.

I'M ALL OUT.
BUT I'M ALMOST THROUGH.

SO, DIVORCING CRAZY HELEN
WAS OUT BECAUSE VINCENT

LOVES HIS GIRLS
AND CRAZY HELEN KNOWS THAT.

AND MURDERING CRAZY HELEN
WAS OUT BECAUSE VINCENT'S

ONE OF THOSE SENSITIVE HUSBANDS,
SO THAT LEFT DESERTING ME.

YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, MARCIA.
YOU KNOW THIS IS TEARING ME UP.

OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH, RIGHT?

LIKE UM, LIKE WHEN I WAS A
LITTLE GIRL FATHER USED TO SAY,

"YOU CAN HAVE EITHER
THE CHOCOLATE BUNNY

OR THE GLAZED EASTER EGG."

BUT I CRIED FOR BOTH
AND I GOT NOTHING.

SO, YOU SEE,
YOU'RE RIGHT, VINCENT.

YOU'RE DOING THE SENSIBLE THING.

I CAN'T GIVE UP MY GIRLS,
YOU KNOW.

IT'S NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR COMPANY.

IT'S NOT THAT SELFISH.

I CAN'T HAVE THEM GROWING UP
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR MOTHER.

THEY'RE SUCH GOOD,
BRIGHT GIRLS.

IT WOULD JUST BE TOO
DESTRUCTIVE FOR THEM.

SO, I HAVE TO MAKE
THE SACRIFICE.

AND UNFORTUNATELY
SO DOES MARCIA.

IF THERE WERE ANY WAY THAT I COULD
BEAR THIS ALONE, BELIEVE ME I WOULD.

I'VE ENJOYED MAKING
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE AGAIN AS ADULTS AND, UM,

I HOPE THAT MY GIRLS
GROW UP TO BE AS CLOSE

AND MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE
AS YOU THREE SISTERS.

AND I LOVE YOUR SISTER, DEEPLY.

OTHERWISE IT NEVER WOULD
HAVE COME TO THIS.

I HOPE YOU BELIEVE THAT.

OF COURSE WE DO, VINCENT.

YES, VINCENT, OF COURSE.

GOODBYE, OLGA.

I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE
A FINE CHANCELLOR.

THANK YOU, VINCENT.
GOODBYE.

GOODBYE.

GOODBYE, IRENE.

I HOPE YOU
AND DAVID WILL BE HAPPY.

THANK YOU.

I HOPE YOU WILL BE TOO.

MARCIA, WOULD YOU WALK ME OUT?
HELP ME FIND A CAB?

I SEE.
OKAY.

WELL.

GOODBYE, MY GIRL.

MARCIA?
PLEASE.

VINCENT.

I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

I'M ALL RIGHT.
OKAY?

IT'S ALL RIGHT.

COME ON, WE'LL PUT YOU
IN A CAB.

HE'S GONE.

FOUR MONTHS.

ALL LOVE SONGS MUST BE WRITTEN DURING THE
FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF A RELATIONSHIP.

IT HAD TO HAPPEN
EVENTUALLY, MARCIA.

YOU KNEW THAT.

YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
PREPARED FOR THIS.

YES.

THE SAME WAY I'M PREPARED
FOR THE EVENTUALITY OF DEATH,

THAT'S HOW PREPARED I AM.

"THOUGH LOVERS BE LOST,
LOVE SHALL NOT."

YOU'LL GET BETTER.
SLOWLY.

REALLY?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

DON'T TURN ON ME
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE UPSET.

NO, REALLY.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT.

CONSOLE ME WITH YOUR VAST
STOREHOUSE OF EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE.

IF YOU NEED TO SWIM IN YOUR OWN
BILE TO REVIVE YOUR SPIRITS,

GO AHEAD, BUT DO IT BY YOURSELF.

MARCIA, SHE'S TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

OH, YEAH, THE SAME WAY
SHE ALWAYS TRIES

TO HELP WITH
HER INTELLECTUAL PLATITUDES

AND LITERARY ALLUSIONS--
A LITTLE MILTON

OR EDNA SAINT VINCENT MILLAY
WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN.

YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVER LOVED SOMEONE

AND HAD TO SAY GOODBYE
AND GET ON WITH HER LIFE?

JUST BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
PARADED ALL MY LOVERS BY YOU,

AND ARGUED WITH THEM
AND CRIED OR--

DON'T PARADE ALL OF THEM.
PARADE JUST ONE.

ARGUE WITH AND CRY OVER
JUST ONE FOR ME?

NO, HISTRIONICS
ARE YOUR DEPARTMENT.

STOP IT. BOTH OF YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

THERE IS A SPACE BETWEEN
HISTRIONICS AND COLD TIT.

TRY INHABITING IT SOMETIME.

I HAVE.
YOU JUST WEREN'T PRESENT WHEN IT HAPPENED.

WHEN I FALL IN LOVE,
NO ONE SMILES AND CONGRATULATES.

THEY SMIRK AND DISPARAGE
AND WHEN THE AFFAIR'S OVER,

NO ONE CONSOLES.

THEY SIGH WITH RELIEF
AND CALL IT INEVITABLE.

I WOULD NEVER DO THAT, OLGA.

NEITHER WOULD I.

I WONDER.

HOW WOULD YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER
TRUSTED US ENOUGH TO TEST US?

I'M SORRY ABOUT VINCENT,
MARCIA.

I KNOW HOW MUCH--

I'M JUST REALLY SORRY.

THANK YOU.

DON'T BE NERVOUS.

YOU JUST TELL THEM
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

GOOD NEWS.
GOOD NEWS.

OKAY.

WELL, I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
WHAT IS IT?

THE AGING PROCESS.

SO WHERE'S THE BARRACUDA?

ARE YOU REFERRING TO MY WIFE?
YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW?

THE MOTHER OF YOU NEPHEW?

I'M NOT RELATED TO FETUSES
REGARDLESS OF GENDER,

BUT YES I WAS REFERRING
TO THAT WOMAN.

FUCK YOU.

ANDREW, PLEASE.

SHE'S TOO MUCH.

SHE TREATS MY MARRIAGE WITH THE SAME
IRREVERENCE SHE TREATS HER OWN.

ANDREW, LEAVE HER ALONE.
SHE'S UPSET RIGHT NOW.

RIGHT NOW?
SHE'S ALWAYS UPSET.

IT'S A CONSTANT STATE.

AND HER FAVORITE, SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE ANOTHER IF YOU PAID HER.

IT'S STRANGE, WE SEEM TO BE
GROWING MORE ALIKE--

THAT'S A DISTURBING THOUGHT.

AS WE GROW FURTHER APART.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?

WILL SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

VINCENT HAD TO--

STOP. DON'T.

VINCENT WHAT?

VINCENT'S WIFE MADE ANOTHER
FEEBLE ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE

THIS TIME BY HOLDING
A PAPER BAG OVER HER HEAD?

VINCENT'S DAUGHTERS PLACED FIRST AND
SECOND IN THE GLORIOUS YOUTH COMPETITION.

VINCENT SMILED.
VINCENT BURPED.

I'M SORRY TO HAVE OVERBURDENED
YOU WITH THE INCONSEQUENTIALS

OF MY AFFAIR WITH VINCENT.

I DID IT TO AVOID
THE DEEPER ISSUES

I WASN'T COMFORTABLE
DISCUSSING WITH YOU.

YOU'VE BECOME A STRANGER TO ME,
ANDREW.

A GENETIC ACQUAINTANCE.

MARCIA, STOP.
SHE DOESN'T MEAN THAT.

YES, SHE DOES.
THAT IS TRUE FOR ALL OF YOU.

YOU'VE ALL MADE ME A STRANGER,
SIMPLY BECAUSE I MADE

ONE DECISION
WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL.

DON'T CONGRATULATE YOURSELF
TOO HEARTILY,

YOU STUPID LITTLE BOY FOR
MARRYING THAT LOW-LIFE BITCH.

SHUT UP.

GOOD ANSWER.

YOU THINK WE FULFILL OURSELVES
BY FOLLOWING YOU THROUGH LIFE,

WIPING YOUR ASS AT EVERY TURN?
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

IF YOU COULD MAKE
ONE INTELLIGENT DECISION

BY YOURSELF, WE COULD DEVOTE
OURSELVES TO WORTHIER PURSUITS.

LIKE EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIRS?

THAT'S A DANGEROUS
TOPIC FOR YOU.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO COME TO THIS
EVERY TIME WE'RE TOGETHER?

BECAUSE WE'VE LEARNED EACH
OTHER'S COMBAT SKILLS

IN ORDER TO DEFEND OURSELVES
FROM EACH OTHER.

WHY WE CAN'T WE LEARN SOMETHING
POSITIVE FROM EACH OTHER,

OR IS THAT TOO RADICAL
AN IDEA FOR THIS FAMILY?

YOU'RE RIGHT, DARLING.
WE SHOULD ALL LEARN FROM YOU.

I CAME HERE WITH GOOD NEWS.

WHAT, ANDREW?
TELL US YOUR NEWS.

WELL, IT'S REALLY
KIND OF A SURPRISE.

WHAT IS THIS?

$175,000?

FOR EACH OF US.

WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

FROM THE HOUSE IN CHARLESTON.

WHAT?

I SOLD THE HOUSE IN CHARLESTON.

YOU SOLD THE HOUSE?

YES.

HOW COULD YOU DO THAT WITHOUT
EVEN CONSULTING YOUR SISTERS?

I'M THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE.

OH, ANDREW.

I'M THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE.

I DON'T HAVE TO CONSULT YOU
FOR EVERY DECISION I MAKE.

NO, BUT I'M SURE
YOU CONSULTED YOUR WIFE.

NO ONE WANTS
TO BE BOTHERED WITH THE DETAILS

OF MAINTAINING THE HOUSE,
OF INTERVIEWING

PROSPECTIVE TENANTS,
OF COLLECTING THE RENT.

THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES, YOU
TACITLY ENTRUST TO ME

BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A DECISION
OF ANY MAGNITUDE--

ANDREW, LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

I SUPPOSE YOU FELT YOU MADE SUCH
A SUCCESS OF THAT OTHER GREAT

DECISION IN YOUR LIFE,
YOUR MARRIAGE, THAT YOU WERE SUDDENLY

QUALIFIED TO SELL OUR HOUSE
WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION?

I'M A GROWN MAN NOW.

I DON'T NEED TO.

YES, YOU DO.

YOU DON'T ASSUME YOUR MATURITY
WITH THOUGHTLESS INCONSIDERATE ACTS.

THAT'S NOT MANHOOD;
IT'S BRUTISHNESS.

IF I HAD PRESENTED IT TO YOU,
WE WOULD HAVE DISCUSSED IT

ENDLESSLY, FOUGHT OVER IT,
AND NEVER REACHED A DECISION.

THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR CHOICE,
NOT YOUR CHOICE.

NO, NO I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

I'M STARTING MY FAMILY NOW.

I'M NOT GOING TO BE TIED
TO THAT HOUSE

AND YOUR APRON'S STRINGS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

DON'T YOU DARE THROW
YOUR NANCYISMS IN OUR FACES.

YOU'LL ALWAYS BE TIED TO US,
WE'RE YOUR SISTERS.

IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE, ANYWAY.

YOU DID IT FOR THE MONEY.

I HAVE MY CHILD TO THINK OF.
THAT'S THE FUTURE.

THE HOUSE IS A THING
OF THE PAST.

IRENE AND DAVID WERE PLANNING
ON MOVING INTO THE HOUSE

AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

NOW YOU WEREN'T SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING THAT WAY, WERE YOU?

WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
WE SPOKE ABOUT DRIVING DOWN, REMEMBER?

YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
THAT THAT WAS JUST--

JUST DELUSIONS OF A SICK GIRL?

NO, I MEANT IT AND IF YOU WERE
JUST WEAVING A SICK BED FANTASY

FOR ME, I BELIEVED IT SO
COMPLETELY, IT MADE ME STRONGER

AND GAVE ME HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
AND I THOUGHT I HAD ONE, TOO,

YOU KNOW, EVEN IF IT WAS TIED
TO MY PAST.

I'M SORRY.

I HAD NO IDEA.

NO, OF COURSE NOT.

YOU'VE ALL PATTED ME ON THE HEAD
SO MANY TIMES;

YOU CONSIDER IT SUSTENANCE.

WE CAN STILL GO DOWN.

WHAT'S THERE FOR US NOW,
ANDREW?

WHEN YOU SOLD THE HOUSE,
SO MUCH WENT WITH IT.

FATHER SAID WE SHOULD BE
LIKE ONE HEART BEATING IN FOUR BODIES.

DID HE?

NO, OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.

REAL ESTATE MARKET HASN'T BEEN
THIS GOOD IN YEARS.

I COULDN'T PASS UP
THE OPPORTUNITY.

SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND'S
A GREAT PRICE.

YES, A VERY GREAT PRICE.

TAKE IT.

I THOUGHT IT WOULD
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

NO, YOU DIDN'T.

DID YOU TELL THEM?

HE TOLD US.

ISN'T THAT GREAT NEWS?

OH SPARE US,
HE TRIED THAT ONE ALREADY.

$700,000 IS A GREAT PRICE.

THE MARKET HAS NOT BEEN
THIS GOOD IN YEARS.

ANDREW KNEW HE COULDN'T PASS UP
THE OPPORTUNITY--

THE OPPORTUNITY, YES.
WE HEARD THE SPIEL.

LET'S JUST HAVE OUR LITTLE PARTY
AND GET IT OVER WITH, SHALL WE?

YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME
A PARTY.

NOBODY'S FORCING YOU.

ANDREW, WHY DON'T
WE JUST GO HOME, HUH?

IF YOU WANT TO.

NONSENSE. DAVID'S COMING
AND DOCTOR CHEBRIN AND HARRY.

AND VINCENT.

NO. NO.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE.

THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

NEITHER WILL I.

BUT YOU MUST EVEN THOUGH
THE PARTY'S NOT FOR YOU, ANYWAY.

IT'S FOR OUR LITTLE
UNBORN NEPHEW.

GOD SAVE HIM FROM YOUR GENES.

DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY CHILD LIKE THAT.

HE'S NOT A CHILD YET,
DEAR, JUST SOME PROTOPLASM

DOING THE BACKSTROKE
IN YOUR UTERUS.

BESIDES, I'M SURE
HE COULDN'T EVEN HEAR ME.

YOU REALLY HATE ME, DON'T YOU?

NO. NOT AT ALL.

DO YOU HATE A DOG
FOR PEEING ON THE CARPET?

OF COURSE NOT.
SHE CAN'T HELP IT.

IT'S HER NATURE.

YOU JUST HAVE TO LEAVE HER
OUTSIDE.

YOU REALLY HATE ME.

IS THAT YOUR GOAL?

BECAUSE I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE
TO ACCOMMODATE YOU.

MARCIA, STOP IT.
YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS TOO MUCH.

ANDREW, ARE YOU GOING TO LET HER
SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT?

YOU WANT ME TO BELT HER?
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HELP.

I WOULD LIKE TO GO.

WE WON'T BE SPENDING MUCH TIME
TOGETHER AFTER MY CHILD IS BORN.

DON'T KEEP BRINGING
UP THAT CHILD

OR SOMEONE JUST MIGHT ASK YOU
WHO THE FATHER IS.

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

I SAID, I HEARD
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING YOUR WAY

THROUGH THE SCHOOL ORCHESTRA.

WHERE WERE YOU FIVE MONTHS AGO,
THE STRING SECTION?

YOU BITCH.
YOU FUCKED UP--

LET HER, ANDREW.
LET HER SHOW HER ROOTS.

YEAH.
I'M TEMPTED.

GET OFF ME.

HAPPY?

ARE YOU?

YOU HYPOCRITICAL BITCH.

IF YOU WERE CAPABLE
OF CONCEIVING,

YOU'D BE PREGNANT WITH THAT
DAGO'S ILLEGITIMATE BASTARD.

XENOPHOBIA AND REDUNDANCIES,
ALL IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

GO TO THE BACK OF THE CLASS.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

THE USUAL.

TELL HIM WHY, ANDREW.

THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A FESTIVE OCCASION.

IT IS AND WE'RE ALL DOING
WHAT WE ENJOY MOST.

OH, I CAN IMAGINE WHAT
THAT WAS FOR YOU.

YOU SURPASSED YOURSELF TODAY.

SO DID YOU.

THAT BITCH IS EVIL.

OLGA, WHY CAN'T YOU
CONTROL THESE SITUATIONS?

YOU'D HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

REGARDLESS, OLGA.

APPARENTLY, HARRY
MADE YOU CLASS MONITOR

AND YOU FELL SHORT
OF HIS EXPECTATIONS.

I'M LEAVING.

I'VE TRIED TO BE PART
OF THIS FAMILY.

I HAVE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND
YOU AND BE PATIENT--

IRENE, STOP PLAYING
THE GOD-DAMMED THING.

I HAVE TRIED TO BE PATIENT
WITH YOUR "ECCENTRICITIES,"

AS ANDREW CALLS THEM.

BUT I THINK YOU PEOPLE
ARE ALL JUST LOW, MEAN

AND NOT NEARLY SO SMART
OR HIGH-CLASS

AS YOU THINK YOU ARE
OR AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

YOU KNOW, WITH SOME ASSISTANCE
FROM THE BOOK

OF SYNONYMS AND ANTONYMS,
THAT WOULDN'T BE A BAD SPEECH.

SHUT UP.
THAT'S JUST WHAT I MEAN.

I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU
ILLUSTRATE YOUR POINT.

I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART
OF YOUR FAMILY ANYMORE.

I'M STARTING MY OWN FAMILY.

AND ANDREW, YOU NEED TO DECIDE
WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO BE PART OF.

DRAMATIC PAUSE.

GO AHEAD, ANDREW.

YOU MADE YOUR DECISION
WHEN YOU GAVE US THESE.

WHAT IS THAT?

UH, MAD MONEY.

HOW APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.

IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH TO DRAG
YOUR SORRY ASS OUT OF THERE.

JESUS--

DO NOT JESUS ME, ANDREW.
YOU GET ME A FUCKING CAB.

JESUS ME.

OH, LEAVE HER ALONE, HARRY,
THIS ISN'T THE TIME.

WHY NOT?
ANDREW WILL BE BACK.

HE ALWAYS FORGIVES HER.

ASSUMING I'M THE ONE REQUIRING
FORGIVENESS.

WHAT HAPPENED?

VINCENT LEFT.

ANDREW SOLD THE HOUSE
IN CHARLESTON.

OH MY GOD.

PEOPLE IN 12-STEP PROGRAMS
ARE SO ANNOYINGLY HONEST.

IT'S QUITE BARBARIC, REALLY.

I SEE.

WHAT DO YOU SEE,
YOU FOOLISH LITTLE MAN?

I'M SUPPOSED TO OPEN MY ARMS
TO YOU NOW.

PLEASE DON'T BOTHER.

AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

I'M SUPPOSED
TO WELCOME YOU BACK.

SO IF YOU SUPPOSED--

I'M SUPPOSED TO WELCOME YOU BACK
AND FORGIVE YOU.

HARRY, HARRY.

IF YOU WANT
TO WITHHOLD APPROVAL,

INTIMIDATE AND GIVE REWARDS
AND PUNISHMENTS, BUY A DOG.

OH, THE "LITTLE MOTHER"
HASN'T ARRIVED YET?

"THE LITTLE MOTHER," AS YOU
SO APPROPRIATELY CALL HER,

HAS COME AND GONE.

I MISSED THE TOAST.

WE ALL DID, DOCTOR.

WE DON'T NEED THE HOUSE.

WE COULD STAY AT MY APARTMENT
AND LATER--

LATER.
IT'S ALWAYS LATER.

IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT, IRENE,
YOU'LL SEE.

I KNOW. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO POSTPONE GRATIFICATION.

MAKE CONCESSIONS.

BUT IF WE GET TOO FAR FROM WHAT
WE PLANNED FOR OURSELVES,

IF CONCESSIONS AND COMPROMISE
BECOME OUR LIFE,

WE DISAPPEAR
WITH OUR ASPIRATIONS.

SWEETIE, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO BE HAVING SUCH THOUGHTS.

AM I, DOCTOR?

YES.
IT'S ALL TRUE, OF COURSE.

BUT DARLING, YOU SHOULDN'T
REALIZE IT 'TIL MUCH LATER.

YOUR CYNICISM IS DISCOURAGING,
DOCTOR.

I'M NOT DISCOURAGING HER.

I'M ENCOURAGING HER
TO KEEP HER DELUSIONS.

YOU NEED THEM WHEN
YOU'RE YOUNG.

I'VE HAD THEM FOR SO LONG,
I'VE OUTGROWN THEM, PREMATURELY.

AND I'VE SWORN OFF
ALL SUBSTITUTES THAT I FOUND.

SO, WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME?

FILL THE VOID WITH LOVE.

FILL THE VOID WITH LOVE.

A CONVENIENT PHILOSOPHY
FOR YOU TO ESPOUSE.

I WASN'T ADDRESSING YOU.

WHERE IS OUR TOAST?
WE WERE GOING TO TOAST NEW LIFE.

NOW, WE'LL TOAST LOVE AND HOPE.

THEY'RE BASICALLY
THE SAME THING.

I'LL GET THE GLASSES.

MR. SOKOL.
WON'T YOU JOIN US IN OUR TOAST?

CERTAINLY.

WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

TO LOVE AND HOPE AND
THE SUGARPLUM FAIRY.

MR. SOKOL, YOU DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE THE ESPRIT D'TOAST THIS EVENING.

WHY NOT JUST LEAVE US
TO OUR COMFORTING RITUAL.

NO, NO.
I'D LIKE TO JOIN YOU.

MAYBE THIS WILL BE MY TICKET
TO FOOL'S PARADISE.

WHY DON'T YOU TO GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

NO ONE INVITED YOU.

DAVID.

ACTUALLY THE SISTERS
DID EARLIER, TO TOAST THE EXPECTANT MOTHER.

ALTHOUGH NOW, I SEE IT'S SHIFTED
TO THE DISTRAUGHT FIANCEE.

WE WERE JUST BEING POLITE,
MR. SOKOL.

NOT REALIZING THE EXTENT OF
YOUR BITTERNESS AND DEPRAVITY.

NOW, THERE IS A TOAST.
TO BITTERNESS AND DEPRAVITY.

THEY'RE BASICALLY
THE SAME THING, RIGHT, DOCTOR?

MR. SOKOL,
YOU REALLY SHOULD LEAVE.

YES.
PLEASE DO.

TO LOVE AND HOPE.

YES.

TO LOVE AND HOPE.

TO LOVE AND HOPE.

GARY.

NO, NO.

GARY, STOP.

STOP THIS.

STOP IT.

NO.

STOP THEM.

OH MY GOD, HE'S NOT MOVING?

CAREFUL.
DON'T MOVE HIM.

DR., CALL A PARAMEDIC.

OH, MY GOD.

GOD, DAMN IT.
SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE.

YES.

WAIT. NO. NO. NO.
NO. NO. NO, DARLING.

HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW,
DARLING.

HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT IN HERE?

SEE, EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL, OKAY.

HE'S FALLEN AND STRUCK HIS HEAD.
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

YES, HE'S BLEEDING.

WHY DON'T YOU PLAY SOMETHING,
DEAR?

HERE.
COME ON.

THE SECURITY WILL
BRING YOU TO US.

YES, PLEASE HURRY.

DAVID.
DAVID.

HE'S OVER HERE.

NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.

THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

STOP TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
JUST GET OUT OF MY WAY.

MARCIA?

MARCIA, I'LL TAKE HER.

NO, FATHER. WE HAVE HER.
SHE'S SAFE WITH US.

WE HAVE HER.
SHE'S SAFE WITH US.

ALL RIGHT?

YES.

JUST TAKE HIM UP.

DAVID.

STRAP HIM.
STOP.

WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MAN?

I AM.
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

DAVID.

HE HAS A SERIOUS CONCUSSION,
MA'AM.

HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

YES, HE CAN.
I'M HERE, DAVID.

UH.

HE HEARS ME.

STRAP HIM IN.

EASY UP.

EASY.
