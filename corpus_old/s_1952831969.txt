[STUDENTS CHEERING]

Hey, man, let's get out of here!
School is out.

What's up, little brother?
I gotta catch up with the twins.

Hi, Will.

Hi, Gwen. Come on, let's go.

PAUL:
Hey, Will.

Any thoughts on your first semester
as an American overseas?

WILL: Guys, stop it.
PAUL: Just answer.

ROBIN [IN ENGLISH ACCENT]:
In an English place.

PAUL [IN ENGLISH ACCENT]:
At an English school.

The people wanna know
if you made any friends.

That's their question to you.

Any, uh, lady friends, maybe?

ROBIN: Looks like a pretty lady there.
Okay, guys? Guys, back off.

Shut up.
Talk to her.

Why don't you talk to her?
ROBIN: Because I see you want to.

Hey, that's the new girl, right?

Will, why don't you go talk to her?

I mean, why not?

WILL:
Wait, you forgot your scarf!

JAMES:
Are we gonna go to any soccer games?

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

[CAR HORN HONKS]

Good afternoon, Stantons.

Miss Greythorne wishes to extend
an invitation to the whole <i>family...</i>

<i>...to</i> attend a Christmas Eve party
at the manor. Mince pies, mulled wine.

Can we count on you?
Yeah.

What about you, Will?

Oh, yes, Mr. Lyon. We'll be... I'll be...
It's Merriman, please.

Okay.
Look forward to your company.

We'll be there.

JAMES: If you refuse, I'm afraid we'll be
forced to ridicule you behind your backs.

GWEN: What's a mince?
ROBIN: I hope it's a fruit.

Would it kill them to put, like,
a cherry or apples in their pies?

Lf it has meat in <i>it...</i>
WILL: Guys, wait up.

<i>...I</i> don't think
it should be called a pie.

MARY:
Hey, guys, look who's home.

JAMES: Whoa! Look at this stranger.
GWEN: Max!

MAX: Hello, fellas.
ROBIN: Oh, my God, Max.

PAUL:
What are you doing here?

MAX:
Hey. Family Christmas.

Family Christmas?
Didn't stop you missing last year.

Or the year before.
MAX: Hey.

Hey, Gwen, sweetie, you don't
let these guys corrupt you, all right?

JAMES: So, Max, how's college?
Uh, it's pretty good.

Hey, Max.
You still doing that tae kwon do?

Come on.
ROBIN: Here it comes.

MAX:
Challenge me.

[BOTH GRUNTING]

Don't kill him. He just got home.
Guys.

WILL:
Hey, Mom.

How was school?
WILL: It was good.

Yeah?

MAX:
Will.

I got your room.

MAX:
Hey, Will.

How long are you staying?

I don't know. A week, maybe two.

All this for a week or two?
Come on, Will, do me this one favor.

People to see,
I got phone calls to make.

I can't do that
if I'm sleeping in the attic, can I?


But I can?
Yeah, well, you're young. Versatile.

Hey. We gonna go all out
for your birthday?

Special day. I didn't forget.
Don't change the subject.

Thirteen.

They grow up so fast.

Fourteen, actually.

ROBIN:
Hey, man. Lame about Max. Come on in.

Glad to have you here.
<i>Hey...</i>

...this will be your designated area.
PAUL: Yes. Smile.

ROBIN: It's tape. What?
That's funny. Come on.

[WIND BLOWING]

Boys, turn the TV off. James.

MARY:
Come on. Everything's getting cold.

ROBIN: Ketchup.
JOHN: Where have you been, honey?

[DOGS GROWL]

None of your business.

Maybe, uh... Maybe next year we'll get
Stephen home, make up the full crew.

Would you like to see Stephen?
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

Well, we'll try to get him home.
Depends where the Navy sends him.

JAMES: The Bermuda Triangle.
To Stephen.

ALL:
To Stephen.

JAMES:
How come yours is in a can?

JOHN: So, Max,
how did the semester finish off?

Oh, it was, uh,
it was good, you know.

Any more thoughts on grad school?
MAX: Nope.

Just still, you know,
weighing my options.

Weighing your options.
And what about you, Dad?

JOHN:
Things are pretty good.

Good, so then you're coping?

I mean, it's a lot, you know.
New place, new job.

It's been a long time
since you've felt able, right?

Max, drop it.

No, it's all right. It's all right.

It's turning out to be a good year.
Yeah.

The move here has been good for us.
It has.

All of us.

[DOGS GROWL]

PAUL:
Will. Will!

What are you staring at?

The dogs.
ROBIN: Hey, man, I know that look.

PAUL: Yeah, it's the look that girl
gave you on the bus.

You met a girl on the bus today?
No, he looked at a girl on the bus today.

ROBIN: Wasn't his type.
PAUL: She looked at me.

MARY: All right. Leave him be.
PAUL: I'm good-Iooking. Can't help it.

Isn't this nice?

[DOGS GROWLING]

[BELLS RINGING]

GEORGE: I told you
we should have trimmed it first.

MARY:
Hey, guys, the tree's here.

[GEORGE AND DAWSON GRUNTING]

DAWSON: Come on, George, push.
GEORGE: There we go.

Come on. It's gorgeous. Just bring it
on through. Be careful of the boots.

Boys, come and help.
Isn't that gorgeous?

Just lean it up against that wall
and my boys will take care of it.

Will, this is Mr. Dawson
from Court Farm, and George.

GEORGE:
I got it.

DAWSON:
<i>So...</i>

<i>...this</i> is Will Stanton, eh?

A pleasure to meet you.
And you, sir.

Hey, George, look here. It's Will.

So it be. And with a birthday today
as well.

Yeah.
MARY: That's right.

Yeah, that's right.

Can I get you gentlemen something,
coffee or tea?

No, we're only stopping.
Too much to do before the storm sets in.

The storm?
DAWSON: Yes.

Bad weather on the way.
Tomorrow will be a bad night.

The nights <i>after...</i>

...beyond imagining.
Really?

Excuse me.

Well, you have a good day, huh?

Come on, George.
MARY: Thank you so much.

DAWSON: Missis.
Will.

You gonna come open your presents?
Oh, yeah.

MAX:
Hey, heads up.

Happy birthday, big guy.

Sorry, I made a little mistake with
the age. I'll fix that right up for you.

No, no, that's okay.

ROBIN: Here you go. Happy birthday.
Thanks.

Second one comes on Christmas.
There's two.

Yeah, happy birthday, man.

ROBIN:
Is this all the milk we have?

MARY:
I'm gonna make some eggs, all right?

Boys, come on.
Give me a hand here.

Gwen.

You shouldn't have.
I knew everyone else would forget.

Thanks.
Here, let me help you.

So what's your wish?
What?

It's your birthday.
You're allowed to have a wish, anything.

Snow. You know,
like we used to get back at home.

Yeah.
I want lots of snow.

GWEN: You guys, I got him. He's here.
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

Stephen!
Hey, son.

<i>Hey, Mom and Dad.</i>
<i>Bros! Gwen, look at you.</i>

<i>You're becoming a heartbreaker.</i>
MARY: Isn't she?

<i>Sorry I can 't be there. As you can see,</i>
<i>I'm busy defending the free world.</i>

JOHN: We miss you, son.
ROBIN: Very tropical.

<i>All the gifts sort of have</i>
<i>a Hawaiian theme.</i>

JAMES:
Yeah, perfect for winter in England.

<i>Hey, Will, listen, yours is different.</i>

<i>I was walking the street market,</i>
<i>and...</i>

<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>I knew it was for you.</i>

Cool. Thanks, Stephen.
How cute. Oh, these are fantastic.

<i>Anyway, enjoy the day,</i>
<i>and I wish I was there.</i>

JOHN: You too.
We wish you were home too, Stephen.

<i>Take care of Mom and Dad, guys.</i>
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

JOHN:
Merry Christmas!

SANTA:
You want all those things, do you?

Can I help you?

Hello? Are you going to buy that?

Sorry. Um, it's for my sister.

It's 5 pounds.

Thank you.

There you go. Thank you.
Thanks.

Excuse me, sir.

I wonder if you wouldn't mind
coming back with us.

We think you left the store
without paying for an item.

What? No, I don't think so. I'm sorry.

It might just be a simple mistake, <i>sir...</i>

<i>...but</i> perhaps you would
accompany us to our <i>office...</i>

...rather than dealing with it
here in public.

This way.
Please.

You all right, then?
WILL: Mm-hm.

Nicked something, didn't you?

"Nicked"?
You stole something.

We've been watching you
from the moment you came in.

SECURITY GUARD 1:
He looks like trouble.

SECURITY GUARD 2:
Looks like a thief.

SECURITY GUARD 1:
Wandering hands have deep pockets.

Children are always the worst.

SECURITY GUARD 1: You won't mind
if we search you, then? Mm?

What?
Or you'd rather we call your parents?

Tell them you're being investigated
for <i>shoplifting...</i>

...which is a criminal offense
in this country.

That's right.
Don't waste our time, Will.

[IN DISTORTED VOICE]
Just give us the Sign.

How do you know my name?

Give us the Sign, Will.
Just give us the Sign.

Give us the Sign.
Just give us the Sign.

The Sign. Give us the Sign.

Give us... Give us the Sign.
Give us the Sign!

WILL:
Get off!

Robin. Paul. How many times
we have to tell you? Not in the house.

PAUL: Sorry.
ROBIN: Sorry, Dad.

Dad... Dad, can we talk?

[TELEVISION SQUEALING]

Can we do it later, Will? I have to
grade all this before the holidays.

Since nobody wants to stress about
physics over <i>Christmas...</i>

<i>...I</i> have to do it myself. Later, I promise.
Just for a sec, please.

Look, something is going on with me.
I'm... I don't...

It's mixed up.

Will, you're 14.
These changes are normal.

Uh, you talk to your brothers about it.

Thank you very much.

Do take something to eat.

Hope you're hungry.
PAUL: I am.

They're always hungry.
JOHN: Yes, they are.

Merry Christmas, Miss Greythorne.

We need to talk to him.
Discretion, Merriman.

There is a right way to do things.

And a way of getting them done.

A drink for the vicar, please.

VICAR: Thank you very much, Merriman.
Less haste, Merriman.

[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]

No way.

WILL:
Ha, ha.


It's fruit. Mince pie is fruit.

Oh, thank God.
PAUL: It's fruit?

GEORGE:
All right?

Something to eat?
No. No, I'm fine.

Drink?
I'm cool.

Nice to see you again.

Out of your league, buddy.

Watch and learn.

Hey, how you doing?
MAGGIE: Hi there.

Thank you.

JAMES: Want some food or something?
MAGGIE: Sure.

MERRIMAN: He slipped away.
He had his reasons.

We ought to go after him.

This may not be the best moment.
The boy is troubled.

I'm used to dealing
with warriors, not boys.

This warrior is a boy.

We can't afford to wait.
You know what's out there.



[HORSE NEIGHS]

[DOGS BARKING]

[WILL GRUNTING]

RIDER: Why do you run, boy?
Who are you? What do you want?

The Sign.
I don't know what you're talking about.

[HORSE NEIGHS]

Are you frightened of me?

You should be, Will. I'm very angry.
All this time it was you.

Give me the Sign.
What Sign?

Give it to me!
I don't know what you're talking about.

You escaped me once before,
a mistake I won't repeat.

Now, give me the Sign.
DAWSON: Leave him be.

Leave the boy alone, Rider.

You can't fight us all.

You're not strong enough.
Not yet, but I will be.

My power rises now.
Five days are all I need, then <i>you...</i>

<i>...and</i> all your kind will be destroyed.

Merry Christmas, Will.

[HORSE NEIGHS]

Walk with us, Will.

Where?
Through time.

Where am I?
MERRIMAN: This is the Great <i>Hall...</i>

...where we are strongest.
You're safe here, Will.

No one may enter here
without our invitation.

WILL:
Who are you?

We are the Old Ones.
Well, to tell the <i>truth...</i>

...we're neither young nor old,
being outside time.

You're the last of us to be born.
You are the Sign Seeker.

Everybody keeps
talking about these Signs.

Sorry. Honestly, I don't know
what that is.

GREYTHORNE:
<i>Will...</i>

<i>...you</i> are part of something that
has been waiting for you all your life.

We, the Old Ones, we serve the Light.

The Rider, he serves the Dark.

The Dark is rising, Will.

It is you who must restore
the power of the Light.

Um, I'm sorry, Miss Greythorne,
but maybe you've got the wrong guy.

MERRIMAN: A thousand years ago,
a great battle was fought <i>here...</i>

...between the Light and the Dark.

The Light won, but only <i>just...</i>

<i>...and</i> the Earth was saved.

The Dark was defeated
but not destroyed.

GREYTHORNE:
To protect the power of the <i>Light...</i>

<i>...it</i> was divided and hidden
in the form of six Signs.

And the <i>Seeker...</i>

<i>...will</i> find the Signs.

WILL:
And you think I'm this Seeker?

MERRIMAN:
On your 14th <i>birthday...</i>

<i>...when</i> you were
first able to sense a <i>Sign...</i>

<i>...the</i> Dark sensed you.

In five days' time, it'll reach its peak.

Unless you have all the Signs,
you won't be able to fight it.

I don't know how to sense a Sign.

The book will tell you
how the Signs are to be found.

Only the Seeker can read the book.

You are special, Will.

The seventh son of a seventh son.

You got it wrong. Sixth, actually.
I only have five brothers.

I guess you made a mistake.
I'm sorry. I'm not the one.

GREYTHORNE: You will not be able
to run from this, Will.

MERRIMAN:
Better open that now.

See what'll happen in five days' time
if the Dark prevails.

Tell us.

Leave me alone!

[BOTH GRUNT]

ROBIN:
You okay?

PAUL: Yeah. You?
Yeah.

PAUL:
What was that?

ROBIN:
I don't know. Puberty?

Where did you get this?

Surfing. Seemed sort of <i>cool...</i>

<i>...and</i> I figured, physics problem,
I know the man to ask.

Since when did physics become cool?

I don't know.
You spend all your time on it.

I thought maybe
we could spend time on it together.

I always hoped you'd stick to
more fulfilling pursuits, like Xbox.

Dad. Really, I'm interested.

It's, like, some sort of equation
about light and darkness.

Almost like they're fighting
for the same space.

What I need to know is, can dark win?

That's not how it works. There are
no winners and losers in physics, Will.

But according to this, Dad,
maybe darkness isn't just dark.

But <i>like...</i> But like a thing.

So I <i>mean...</i>

...could darkness...?
Could it hurt someone?

"Hurt someone"?

That's not how <i>it...</i>

Look, Will, don't waste your time with
this stuff. It's theoretical. It's boring.

I wanna know.
Well, you can't.

Look, Will, you're a kid. Just enjoy it.

Just be happy you don't have to
deal with it. I have work to do.

You know, Dad, when I was <i>little...</i>

<i>...you</i> never told me
not to be afraid of the dark.

[WINDOW RATTLING]


MARY:
Will, stay off that foot.

Mom, it's fine, okay? I just twisted it.

I called the doctor to see
if you should go to the hospital.


I do not want to go to the hospital.
I know. We'll see what he says.

WILL: Mom, I do not want
to go to the hospital.

MARY: Hello, doctor.
RIDER: Good afternoon.

MARY: Come in.
RIDER: And I hope you don't have to.

Hello, Will.
Let's have a look, shall we?

MARY:
Come on, sweetheart.

Come on.
WILL: Wait a minute, Mom. Mom.

Honey, it's all right.
RIDER: Come along.

Don't worry, I don't bite.

Come on. There we go.

RIDER:
Here we are. Let me see, here.

RIDER:
Mm. I wonder, Mrs. <i>Stanton...</i>

<i>...do</i> you have a tape measure
so I can check the swelling?

Yes, yes, I'll go look.
No.

Thank you.
Mom, stay here.

Somebody doesn't want to
be separated from his mommy.

MARY: Come on, now.
You'll be fine. I'll be right back.

Leave me alone.
These old <i>fools...</i>

...would have you do work
that they <i>can't...</i>

<i>...but</i> they haven't told you
that you'll fail.

Now, give me the Signs, Will.

I don't forget those
who stand with me.

Nor those who stand against.
I don't have what you want.

Will, I'm the Dark on this earth.

I'm the end of everything
you see and know.

But I can help you.

Or I can make things
very much worse.

MARY:
Here we go.

Ah! Wonderful.

Actually, it's fine.

The good news is he hasn't broken it.
Yes.

But I do think he's damaged the
ligaments, so it's going to take time.

Now, my advice to you, William,
is take it easy.

And don't look so worried.
It's not the end of the world.

Not quite yet.

[MARY AND RIDER CHUCKLE]

I so appreciate it.

What...? What happened?

We... We don't know. We don't know.

What do you mean?

Mom, what do you mean?

When you were <i>both...</i>

<i>...just</i> 2 weeks old,
just new, just <i>babies...</i>

[BABIES CRYING]

...there was a storm one night.

[THUNDER CRASHING]

<i>You were both crying</i>
<i>and I took you downstairs.</i>

<i>Your father was working in the study.</i>

<i>I asked him to check on your brother.</i>
<i>He was distracted for a few minutes.</i>

<i>And when he went in...</i>

<i>...Tom...</i>

He was gone.

What, kidnapped?

They searched for months and <i>we...</i>

We hoped for years,
but they <i>didn't...</i>

They never found anything.

Why didn't you ever tell me?
We were devastated.

Especially your dad.
You know, he just blamed himself.

As the years went <i>by...</i>

<i>...we</i> just spoke of it less and <i>less...</i>

...until <i>finally...</i>

<i>...just</i> not at all.

<i>So...</i>

<i>...was</i> Tom born before me?

Yeah.

Yeah, he was.

Another big brother.

Seventh son.

WILL: "Six Signs were created
to contain the power of the <i>Light...</i>

<i>...from</i> stone, bronze, iron,
wood and water.

But the sixth was to be carried
in the essence of a..."

The essence of a human soul?

"The Signs were hidden
and scattered throughout time.

The Seeker will find them."

Okay.

Look at this.
This pattern, it's a fractal.

It's physics.
My dad teaches this stuff.

Like a hiding place
that goes on and on forever.

Like a clue hidden in plain sight
that declares the presence of a Sign.

WILL: George, can you
pass me your hammer, please?

GEORGE:
Here you go.

Thank you.

Gwen, I'm sorry.

[WILL GRUNTS]

The Sign of Stone.

Five more to go.

You are the seventh son
of a seventh son, Will Stanton.

You step through time.

One by one, the Signs will call to you.
You will gather <i>them...</i>

<i>...and</i> gain the power of the Light.
You are the Seeker.

MERRIMAN:
Not all the Signs will be so easy.

And the Rider wants them too.

He may try to trick or threaten you.

Well, then how do I face the darkness?
You'll learn to face it as you are.

You have powers, Will.

You'll be able to
command light or <i>fire...</i>

<i>...move</i> objects,
summon great <i>strength...</i>

<i>...and,</i> of course, step through time.

Can I fly?
What?

You know. Zoom. Fly.

No. No, I don't think you can.

MERRIMAN:
Merry Christmas.

RIDER: Mrs. Stanton.
Yes.

May I introduce you to my mother?

Mother, this is Mrs. Stanton.
She lives in the village.

Hello.

And this is the young boy
I was telling you about.

VICAR:
A very happy Christmas to you all.

If we can now <i>stand...</i>

...we'll sing hymn number one from
the hymn book, "Joy to the World."

[ALL SINGING "JO Y TO THE WORLD"]

Where is everybody?

Exactly when they were.

It's we that have moved.

They can't see it, of course.
You've sensed a Sign, Will.

You've moved us through time.

It's late 13th or early 14th century.

I see.

The crypt has not been bricked up,
so that means we're before the plague.

About 1290, I'd say.

Be quick, Will. The Rider was present
and he will hunt you through time.

I don't know where it is exactly,
just that it's here.

[CROW CAWS]


I suggest we prepare.

Merriman, guard the Seeker.

What do you reckon?

Dragon.

GEORGE: He wouldn't
send a dragon against us, Mr. Dawson.

Knows better than that.

It could be a shapeless beast, I suppose.
No. Dragon.

GEORGE:
I don't think so.

Flagon of ale says it is.

[FOOTSTEPS POUNDING]

GEORGE:
That ain't no dragon.

GREYTHORNE:
Be careful. She's not what she seems.


Will, where's the Sign?

I'm looking. I'm not sure.
Concentrate!

I'm trying!

Guys!

Stand back, Will! Stand back, Will!

Hurry, Will! Hurry!

Find the Sign!

Will, use your powers.

My powers? Right. My powers.

Light!

Awesome.

"Thomas Stanton."

You all right, Miss Greythorne?

GREYTHORNE:
This is highly unpleasant.

Will, do hurry up!

Will! Do something! Will!

Okay, Will. Your powers.

MERRIMAN:
Will, hurry!

[WILL YELPS]

I found the Sign.
Guys, I found the Sign!

[ALL SINGING "JO Y TO THE WORLD"]

MARY:
Thank you very much.

Merry Christmas to you.
VICAR: And you.

Professor, are you aware that we have
a Stanton buried in this churchyard?

A Stanton here? No, I had no idea.
MARY: Really?

GREYTHORNE: This section is the oldest
part of the church. You see there?

A stone built into the wall.

Did you enjoy the service?
How about your dear old mom, eh?

[MOTHER HISSES]

Your time will come.

"Here lie the remains <i>of...</i>

...Thomas Stanton."

Stanton, Tom.

GREYTHORNE: He's buried
in the crypt below the church.

An ancestor, perhaps.

My ancestor was an Old One?
Oh, not only that, Will.

He was a craftsman.

MERRIMAN:
<i>In a time...</i>

<i>... of great danger,</i>
<i>when the Dark threatened...</i>

<i>... he made the Signs in secret,</i>
<i>even from us.</i>

<i>He told us that five</i>
<i>were made of common substance.</i>

And the sixth Sign?

Stanton said it could never be found
because it was never hidden.

Then how am I supposed to find it?

You're the Seeker. You're our guide.
Only you can interpret the meaning.

A soul freely given to unleash
the power of the Light.

His own?

Stanton, he made a choice, Will.

His <i>family...</i>

<i>...fled</i> from the Dark,
across the <i>land...</i>

<i>...and</i> his descendants,
across the water.

Until one <i>day...</i>

...they returned.
MARY: I don't see any dates.

Oh, so, there's no way of knowing,
is there?

It could be nothing to do with us,
right?

I mean, just coincidence.
Right.

Yes, of course. Coincidence.

Well, Merry Christmas.

Yes. Merry Christmas to you.

Miss Greythorne is
a generous supporter of the college.

You fixed a job for my dad?

Destiny brought you here, Will.
We just took care of the details.

RIDER: My power increases by the day
and in three, I reach my peak.

But the Seeker has two Signs now
and with each, his strength also grows.

My offer is true.
Work fast, bring me what I <i>want...</i>

<i>...and</i> then you shall
reap your reward.

JOHN:
Best one yet.

MARY: Thank you, sweetheart.
It was good, wasn't it?

JOHN:
Oh, I'm stuffed.

MARY: I am so full.
And we've got lots of turkey leftovers.

Fantastic for sandwiches.
JOHN: Good, sandwiches.

MARY: Hi, guys.
JAMES: Hey. <i>Um...</i>

Everyone, this is Maggie.

Maggie, everyone.

Can I help with anything?

MARY: No, we're fine, really.
Don't worry about it.

We're just stopping for a minute,
then we're gonna run...

James, come on, help your mom.
JAMES: What?

MARY:
That's right, James. Help your mom.

JAMES: Thanks.
MARY: Yeah. Come on over.


Are you an Old One?

Do I look like an Old One?

No, no! I <i>just...</i> Older.

I'm just here to look out for you.
Okay?

Brr. Catch your death out here.

Can I help you?
Yes, Max, I think you can.

Very good.

Here you go.
Thank you.

I can do much more.

I have powers.

Come here.

So you and James, are you <i>guys...?</i>

Are you guys, like, <i>um...?</i>
What?

Friends?
Yes. I like your brother.

I mean, "boyfriend-girlfriend" friends.

Will, aren't there more important things
for you to be thinking about right now?

It's important to me.

I've been thinking about you...

I <i>just...</i> I felt like we were connected.

Hey, where you been?

Waiting for you,
and hanging with your little brother.

So sweet.

Let's go.

Yeah.

"Sweet." Aw.

Can we talk?

I've spent my life being Will Stanton,
a social inadequate.

Most of the time I'm just invisible.

Then you come along and tell me
I'm special and that I've got powers.

So I'm like, "Great, now life's
gonna be better now, right?"

No. No, it's not.

I am no superhero.

I'm still me.

You are the Seeker, Will.

The future of the human race
rests on you. Don't you understand this?

Look, I'm supposed to save the world?

Okay, I can't even figure out
how to talk to a girl.

Don't let a girl distract you.
You've got work to do.

There are only three days left. Go on.

Fine.
Go on!

Three days, Will.
I got it.


Miss Greythorne. Look.

What is he doing? Hm?

[WILL SCREAMS]

Expressing himself.

MERRIMAN: Doesn't he know
he'll exhaust his powers?

You are not without
your own lessons to learn, Merriman.

He came to you, not for more warnings.
He needed you simply to listen.


Will?

Gwen, what are you doing here?

Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

[THUNDER RUMBLING]

What?

Stay close.

[MEN YELLING]

What happened?

We stepped through time.
What?

Gwen, go!

[KITTEN MEWS]

Gwen! Gwen, get down. Get down.

[MAN SCREAMS]

There it is.

Shh. Shh. You're okay.
It's gonna be okay.

I need to get that shield, Gwen. It's
the only way we'll get home. Trust me.

[HORN BLOWING]

Be quiet. It's okay.
Stay there. It's okay.

[KITTEN MEWING]

[MAN GRUNTING]

[WILL YELLING]

Will!

[GWEN SCREAMS]

WILL:
Leave her alone!

Will!

[WATCH BEEPING]

Okay. You want the watch?
Yeah? Yeah?

All right. Trade? All right.
Watch for the shield. Okay?

All right.

Gwen, we got it.

We got it!

MERRIMAN:
Will! I warned you!

Gwen, go home. I'll catch up.
Don't tell anybody about this, okay?

Okay, go home. Go.

You exhausted your powers.
You could have been killed.

I got the Sign, didn't I? On my own.
I didn't see any of you helping.

You were selfish and irresponsible.
Every day, the Dark is tightening its grip.

Only you stand in its way.
Yeah. Yeah, you keep telling me.

Will, Will, Will, please!
All right, I'm sorry. If you <i>wish...</i>

<i>...to</i> express yourself,
I'm sure that I can listen.

It's so... You know, and I'm like...

The whole thing's just, uhn!
You know?

Is that it?

Yeah.
Miss Greythorne said this <i>is...</i>

This is natural for someone your age.

What if I can't do this?

Trust that you can.

Even the smallest light
shines in the darkness.

Go on.

[HORSE NEIGHS]

RIDER:
The height of my power <i>approaches...</i>

<i>...yet</i> still the boy collects,
and now holds three Signs.

You know what you must do.
But <i>understand...</i>

<i>...you</i> are not the only one
that I've enlisted.

So deliver on your promise
or I shall deliver on mine.

[HORSE NEIGHING]

Seeker!

Witness my wrath!

[CROWS CAWING]

[WIND HOWLING]

GREYTHORNE:
Our Seeker has very little <i>time...</i>

...perhaps not enough.

MAN 1: Throw it on the back.
MAN 2: Leave it.

[SIREN WAILING]

They're completely out of food!

There's none left!

We're gonna have to eat
whatever Mom's got in the freezer.

Come on.

Max, you all right?
You know, about your <i>room...</i>

...it'll be more than a couple weeks.

Yeah? Yeah, okay. Whatever.

MAX [IN DISTORTED VOICE]:
"Whatever"?

I'm sick and tired of your attitude.

Saying things behind my back,
turning everyone against <i>me...</i>

<i>...you</i> think I don't see that?

Max. Max, what's going on?

[IN RIDER'S VOICE]
You've got issues, Will.

You wanna sort them out?


[MAX CHUCKLES IN NORMAL VOICE]

Well, well. What do we have here, huh?
You sense a Sign?

Is that what we're doing here, Seeker?
You're getting weird.

Dude, this isn't really you.
Oh, really? It isn't?

Is this real enough for you?

[MAX YELLS]

PROMOTER: Ladies and gentlemen.
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen.

PROMOTER: Gather around.
MAN: Gather around.

PROMOTER: For the main event.
MAN: For the main event.

We have the champion!

[CROWD CHEERING]

And challenging our champion today,
the challenger.

[CROWD BOOS]

PROMOTER:
Ladies and <i>gentlemen...</i>

...fame, fortune and happiness
await you. Lay your...



PROMOTER: Let the championship begin.
MAX: Where's the Sign?

PROMOTER:
Get him out! I want him out of here.

WILL:
Put me down! Put me down!

[WILL YELLS]

MAX: We jumped through time.
You sense a Sign?

Give me the Signs.

Give me all the Signs.

<i>I...</i>

<i>...hate</i> to do this to my own <i>brother...</i>

<i>...but</i> you're not giving me any choice.
So I'm gonna count to 10.

One.
Max!

It doesn't matter about college.
Two.

Three!
That's why your stuff's in boxes.

Because you're not going back.
Four.

Because you dropped out. So what?
Five.

Mom and Dad will understand.

Six.
The Dark is using you, Max.

Seven.
It is using your fear.

You flunked some exams.
So what? Big deal.

It's how you deal with it, Max.
Eight.

You don't have to deal alone.
Your family loves you.

No. Nine.

<i>Max...</i>

<i>...I</i> hate to do this to my own brother.

PROMOTER:
The champion!

[CROWD CHEERING]

[WILL READS ON-SCREEN TEXT]


[MAX GROANS]

WILL: You all right?
My head hurts.

What happened?
You fell.

MAX: Hey, uh, Dad?
Yeah.

You got a sec?

Yeah. Come on in.

[GEORGE AND DAWSON LAUGH]

GEORGE: It won't be stealing.
We'll leave some money, eh?

DAWSON:
Rather you will.

A little wager, George. A flagon of ale.
GEORGE: Yeah.

Nice try, Mr. Dawson.

Dragons indeed.

Anyway, it's a shame to leave
the old place all quiet and Ionesome.

RIDER:
Off duty, gentlemen?

Very careless,
straying out at a time like this.

We're here for a wager, Rider.

We'll take you up on yours as well.

Oh, you Old Ones.

You're not scared of anything, are you?

Well, that's good.

That's going to make it so much easier.

[HORSE NEIGHS]

[CROWS CAWING]

[WIND HOWLING]

MAN [ON RADIO]: <i>The government</i>
<i>has declared a state of emergency.</i>

<i>Attempts are being made</i>
<i>to deliver essential supplies...</i>

<i>... to the most severely affected areas.</i>

<i>Experts believe the current conditions</i>
<i>will last for at least another week.</i>

You guys, Miss Greythorne
has invited everybody in the <i>village...</i>

<i>...to</i> come stay at the manor.

They have their own generator there,
their own food, <i>fuel...</i>

...which is more than we have.

That was the last of our soup
heated on the last of our gas.

Okay, that's it.
We pack our bags tonight.

Tomorrow morning, we go.
PAUL: What if the weatherman's wrong?

He is. The storm will peak in two days.
That's all we have.

If it doesn't get better by <i>then...</i>

<i>...it</i> never will.

<i>Um...</i> Just thinking out loud.

"The Light and the Dark." Were you
working on this when Tom disappeared?

I should have been
caring for you boys.

Instead, I <i>was...</i>

My work. Well, I thought
I was onto something great.

A revelation.
It was just an obsession, though.

It was like I was <i>being...</i>

JOHN: <i>Being pushed to unlock</i>
<i>this darkness. I couldn 't stop it.</i>

And I lost myself.

<i>And worse...</i>

<i>...I</i> lost Tom.

It was my fault.
Dad.

That wasn't your fault.

MARY:
Max, come on!

PAUL:
No, no! Hey! Guys! Guys! No! Hey!

JOHN: Let them go.
They'll be fine. Come on.

MERRIMAN: We have four Signs?
Yes.

The other two?
Look, I'll find them, okay?

Will, tomorrow is what?

Will. Will. Tomorrow is the final day.

Yeah, I know.
But even if I find the fifth <i>Sign...</i>

<i>...I</i> have no idea how to find the sixth.

When I first saw you, I thought,
"No, a boy, not a warrior."

I was wrong.
You've come a long <i>way...</i>

<i>...both</i> as the Seeker
and as Will Stanton.

I believe in you, Will.
You'll find what you need.

Now, where are we strongest?
The Great Hall.

Lf the Dark reaches its peak, meet there.
I can't leave my family.

The only way to help your family
is to defeat the Dark. It's our only hope.

Where's George?

Our enemy knows no mercy.

[HORSE NEIGHS]

RIDER: Your tricks can only delay.
And you have just trapped yourselves.

MAN [ON RADIO]: <i>We are currently</i>
<i>experiencing a temporary calm...</i>

<i>... in what the Meteorological Office</i>
<i>describes as...</i>

<i>... the most ferocious storm</i>
<i>ever recorded.</i>

<i>Reports from around the world</i>
<i>say the worst is yet to come.</i>

<i>Arctic winds, bringing more snow...</i>

<i>... are expected to cause</i>
<i>disruptions in northern England...</i>

<i>... and further south to London</i>
<i>by tomorrow morning.</i>

RIDER:
Now with the darkness comes the cold.

[HORSE NEIGHS]

RIDER:
<i>Give me the Signs, Will.</i>

<i>Give me the Signs, or I will</i>
<i>hurt those who are dear to you.</i>

WILL:
<i>Leave us alone.</i>

RIDER: <i>Do you want to ever</i>
<i>go home with them again?</i>

<i>Give me the Signs and they will live.</i>

<i>Give me the Signs, Will.</i>

WILL:
<i>No.</i>

Gwen! Look out!

[DAWSON YELLS]

[ALL YELLING]

MERRIMAN:
Hang on.

[WOMAN SCREAMS]

DAWSON:
Come, child!

RIDER: <i>Do you love your family?</i>
<i>Do you care about them?</i>

Give me the Signs
or I will choose for you.

Mary. Mary!

Look out.

Help Dad!
Boys, get under the stairs!

WILL:
Get back!

[HORSE NEIGHS]

RIDER: The boy is more capable
than I thought.

Return to him. Bring me the Signs
and you will never age.

MARY: Are you all right?
JOHN: Thank God you're safe.

MARY:
What's going on?

RIDER: Now let water finish
what ice has begun.

JOHN:
Stay together.

Stay together.

It's just water.

[ALL SHOUTING]

Will!

Come with me. You're not safe here.

You need to give me the Signs.

They're my responsibility.
I can handle them.

Let me protect them.
I don't think I can do that.

It's me, Will.

Maggie.

Do you believe what you said?

That we're connected?

Yeah.

I felt it too.

You need to give me the Signs
before it's too late.

You need to trust me.

Do you trust me?

Yeah, I trust you.

RIDER:
<i>Hurry, witch.</i>

<i>With another Sign, he will undo you.</i>

Give me the Signs.

Aagh! Just give me the Signs!
No!

[WILL YELLS]

[ALL SCREAMING]

RIDER:
<i>You have failed me for the last time.</i>

MAGGIE: Agh! Give me the Signs!
WILL: No!

MAGGIE [IN DISTORTED VOICE]:
Give me the Signs!

WILL:
Back off!

[MAGGIE SCREAMING]

JOHN: Help!
MERRIMAN: Hold on!

I'm coming!
MARY: We're under the stairs!

GWEN:
Help, please! Help!

JOHN:
Grab Mr. Merriman's hands.

[HORSE NEIGHS]



The Rider's reached full strength. But
he can't enter here unless we let him.

I still don't have the sixth Sign.

Keep the faith, Will.
You'll find it, I know you will.

MARY:
No.

MARY: Will.
JOHN: Will.

Will, let us in. Please, Will, let us in.

Dad, is that you?
Don't listen, Will.

JOHN: It's your mother.
GWEN: She's hurt real bad.

Gwen, is that you?
MERRIMAN: Don't listen!

[MARY CRYING]

MARY: Open the door.
Don't listen!

MARY: Help me, Will.
Mom!

Mom!

JOHN:
Open this door, Will!

Don't open the door!

Don't open the door!

MARY:
Help me. Open the door!

[HORSE NEIGHS]

[IN MARY'S VOICE]
Thank you, Will.

[RIDER GROWLING]

RIDER [IN NORMAL VOICE]:
Where are your guardians now?

[HORSE NEIGHS]

Have they abandoned their Seeker?

Did you disappoint them, Will?

A thousand years of waiting
and what was there to show? Nothing!

Nothing but a boy who could not
do what was asked of him.

Generations of hope and promise,
all a waste.

I have something here
you might recognize.

Once before I made you an offer, Will.
Now here it is again.

Give me the Signs
and the boy will live.

WILL:
I'm not afraid to die.

I'm not afraid to die!

RIDER:
Who says it's you?

Tom?
RIDER: Yes.

Poor little Tom.

The wrong twin.
My prisoner these last 14 years.

Imagine how he's missed
his dear twin brother.

MERRIMAN:
Resist him, Will! You're Will Stanton.

You are the Seeker.

RIDER: Give them to me.
WILL: No!

RIDER:
Then your time is at an end.

[MERRIMAN SHOUTING]

[MERRIMAN GRUNTS]

[MERRIMAN YELLS]

[GREYTHORNE YELLS]

RIDER:
Say goodbye to little Tom.

WILL:
No! Tom!

[RIDER GRUNTS]

You're alone, boy.
You failed to find the sixth Sign.

And with only five,
you're no match for me.

You're a failure, Will.

MERRIMAN:
<i>I believe in you, Will.</i>

<i>You'll find what you need.</i>

<i>A soul freely given</i>
<i>to unleash the power of the Light.</i>

It's me. My soul.

[HORSE WHINNIES]

I am Will <i>Stanton...</i>

<i>...the</i> seventh son of a seventh son.

I have read the book.

I have walked through time.

I have gathered five Signs.

The sixth could not be found,
because it was not hidden from me.

I am the sixth Sign.

And I have <i>restored...</i>

<i>...the</i> power of the Light.

[RIDER YELLS]

[RIDER SCREAMS]

It's over, right?

It's never over.
But today is a good day.

WILL:
George.

GEORGE:
Mr. Dawson.

George.

I wanna go home.

GREYTHORNE:
I think you should.

There's someone
who wants to go with you.

Tom.

There's some people
I want you to meet.

Come on.

Will?

You did all right.

He might have shown some appreciation,
after all we've done for him.

He's only 14. It's a difficult age.

<i>John? John.</i>

MAX:
Go ahead.
