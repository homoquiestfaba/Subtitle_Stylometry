that takes place</i>

<i>on an island full of wonder.</i>

<i>The story of two lost souls
searching for one another,</i>

<i>although they
don't know that yet.</i>

<i>Because, you see,</i>

<i>no matter how alone
or out of place one feels,</i>

<i>magic is all around us</i>

<i>if you just know
where to look.</i>

[upbeat music playing]

[puppies barking]


[clattering]
[barks]



[dramatic music playing]

[animal control 1] Easy, girl.


Hey, Mama. Good girl.

Come on. We're gonna
take good care of you.

Come on.

[animal control 2]
Let's go, gang.

We're going
to the pound.

[dogs whimpering]


[animal control 1]
Come on, girl, you're okay.

Come on, girl.
[whimpering]

[dramatic music rises]



[melancholy music playing]


[upbeat music playing]


New girl.

put the unit on Airbnb.

We don't play that
'cause we got rules.

No subletting,
no water beds and no pets.

Y'all got that?
Absolutely, Mr. Packard.

We won't even drink water
in bed.

Hey, 5-C!

If your mama
wants her dishwasher repaired,

tell her try a little grease.

She'll know
what I'm talking about.

O-Okay, Mr. Packard.

Yes, I know it's important

and I wouldn't ask unless...
[door opens]

[Emily] Hey, Mom.
[door closes]

Yeah, okay, I understand.

Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

Packard wants a bribe
for the dishwasher.

Splendid!
Just grab a stack of hundreds.

I think they're over there
by the gold bars

that Aunt Irene left us
in this rent-controlled flat.

How was your day, sweetheart?

Somewhere between
abysmal and atrocious.

Those are
two beautiful words,

which you probably
wouldn't use

if you didn't go
to such a good school.

Great! I'll have
an epic vocabulary to use

in my upcoming decades
of therapy.

Okay. It is hard
being the new kid at school.

Those other girls
still bothering you?

It's mostly
just this one girl, Florence.

She calls me "Food Stamp."
[Maggie] Why?

Maybe because I'm on
scholarship, or I'm small,

or because we just
moved here from upstate.

I don't know.
Well, you're different

to those other kids
at school.

That's good.

You know,
people who are unique,

they're the ones
that change the world.

Great!
I'll tell Florence that.

Just let me call her mother.

We can have them over here,
and we can all talk about it.

My gosh,
were you ever a child?

No.

Um, but I was bullied, too.

You know, you just have to
learn to stand up for yourself.

Well, I guess I'm just
not as brave as you.

I don't want to stand out.

I'm gonna go change

and then I'll collect
some more cans

for the charity drive.

Oh, did you talk to your boss
about the Chicago thing?

Okay, so, apparently,

the case has been
moved forward two weeks,

and I'm the only
paralegal who...

Mom!

I am so sorry.
I'm just gonna be gone a couple of days.

Really?

Well, who's gonna
stay with me?

I'll get a lovely sitter.
Yeah?

Just not Uncle Casey.

Uncle Casey?

Who thinks that green M&M's
are vegetables?

No, no, that is not an option.

[loud knocking on door]

Mmm! Wh... Wh...

Coming!

Hey there.

Sorry, I was just, uh,
grabbing a little power nap,

Officer Jackson.

What's this
you got going on in here?

Oh, this is
just a temporary thing.

I'm in between apartments.

Hmm.

Your meter's expired.

Actually, no,
the meter is broken.

Actually, no, it's working.

It just had this bag
over the top of it.

Oh! Who put that there?
Hmm.

It is so disheartening.

I'll get rid of that.
Do you want to give me that?

Just to... Okay.

No, I want to give you this.

Can we do this later?
I am so late. Okay.

Give it to someone else!
Pay it forward.

Ooh. [grunting]

I'm okay. I'm so sorry.
I've got to go.

So late.

[upbeat music playing]




[hand sanitizer dispensing]

Ah! Burn. Burn.

[sighs]
[Casey clears throat] Hi.

Casey Porter here
to see Mr. Harrington

about the illustrator job.

Hi. Yeah.

That was at 3:30 and it's...
Mm, it's 4:15.

Wow. Pretty sure
he said Mountain Time,

so guess I'm early.

No. Sorry.

Okay, then,

are these complimentary?

Sadly, yes.
[candy rattles]

Lunch.

[candy bounces on floor]



Idiot!


[knock on door]

Hey!
[Emily] Hey, Malik.

I'm collecting cans and bottles
for my school's fundraiser.

Do you have anything?
It's Malik the Magnificent now.

I'm going to magic school.
Hey, do you wanna see a trick?

Sure.

Okay, a deck of cards.

Ooh.

Fantastic.


How about you,
Mrs. Crullerman?

Do you have any cans for me?

You can have this one,
<i>malyshka.</i>

No, no! Moment.

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

Here.

Condensed milk?

Magic school. Good luck.

Hey. You know, when I get really good
at magic, you know what I'm gonna do?

Make her disappear?

No, I'm gonna cut her in half.

Oh. Or that.
[door closes]

[upbeat music playing]

Hey, Mrs. Jarvis.
Hi, Emily.

Do you have any more cans for me?
I do.

Does Packard know you're collecting
canisters in his edifice?

[Mr. Jarvis] He'll insist
on a retroactive commission.

Not if we file a 501[c][3]
<i>in loco parentis.</i>

Then, she's protected.

You guys must be good lawyers.

Because I don't know
what you're talking about.

[Emily] Hey, guys!
[bell jingles]

Alonso!
Get the cans for Emily!

Hey, you do it! I'm busy.

I'm doing the tofu!
Eh!

Emily, come check it out.
We got regular, seasoned...

What's there to know?
It's the white stuff in the water.

Here you go, Emily.
[speaking Spanish]

<i>Mira, mira...</i>
[in English] Two years ago,

genius here cuts his hand off
with a meat slicer.

Now he's a tofu-eating vegan.
[chuckles softly]

It was a sign.


[vendor groans]

Doggone it.
[barks]

Ah! Get out of here!
[whimpering]

[honking]
[barks]


[indistinct chattering]


[pigeons cooing]





[whimsical music playing]

There you are.

Come on.

Now, just because you're lost,

it doesn't mean that you're
any less of a treasure.

You understand?
[barking]

Oh, standing up for yourself,
are you?

[dog yelps]

Yes, yes, I know.

You're a dog.

Ah!

Hello.

Now, let's introduce you
to all the others, shall we?


Hope they don't mistake you
for a lobster.

[door closes]

The whole block is bonkers.

What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

You know I said I was gonna get a sitter.
[door opens]


What up, fam?

[door closes]
You promised.

How's my favorite sister?
Hey.

And my favorite little niece?

Money is gonna be
in this drawer here.

And emergency numbers

here.

"911"?

Give me some credit.

Till the super fixes it,
please don't use the dishwasher.

Emily has to be at school
by 7:45.

In the morning?
What are they, farmers?

Ooh, Mom won't be back
till Monday.

So, what are we doing?

"Get a little crew together?
Hit up the club?"

Isn't that what you
young people say?

We don't say that. Ever.

"Get lit?"
Please stop.


Now, Casey,
I'm really counting on you.

Are you sure
you can handle this?

[in British accent] You're
bloody well right I can.

[in American accent] You see,
if I hadn't moved here when I was two,

I would've grown up
with a British accent also.

[in British accent] Bollocks.
Rubbish. Collywobbles.

Are you finished?

Dumbledore.

[Maggie sighs]

I love you.
Love you.

Look, Mags, I got this, okay?

Got the keys?

You've been here two minutes!
I may have lost those.

Um, okay, this is
my only other set.

Okay.
Do not lose those.

I love you guys.
Love you.

[in British accent] Cheerio!

Shocking.


[door closes]

So, how's everything going in,

I'm gonna say fourth grade?

Sixth.
[Casey chuckles]

Joking.

Where's your sense of humor?

I lost it. On the subway.

I lost you one time.

Okay, twice
if you count Atlantic City.

But I won you back!

Hey! I'm gonna
make it up to you, okay?

We're gonna do something
super cool this weekend.

Money is absolutely no object.

As long as there's enough
of it in that drawer.

people up at this hour?

Hey, you want to get a coffee?

I'm twelve. I'm not allowed
to drink coffee.

Red Bull?
Really?

Whew! Being a kid sucks.

[whimsical music playing]

Oh, my gosh. Look,
there's an animal rescue tent!

Can we go in? Please?
[sighs]

My instinct is, "Sure",
so we probably shouldn't?

But how could I say no
to that little face

with those cheeks
and the, ah, missing tooth?

I just want to dust you
in sugar...

Okay, okay, enough.
Okay, okay.

Come on!

[upbeat music playing]

Wow. So beautiful.

Hi!
Hi.

Hi.
[blows raspberry]

Well, you're kind of creepy.

[screeches]
Ah! Sorry!


[ethereal music playing]

Whoa.
Whoa.

Hi.
[cat purrs]

[Emily chuckles]

Oh, my goodness.

Whoa! Uncle Casey,
there's a sloth!

My spirit animal.

[Emily] Whoa.
[Casey] Don't touch that.


[hisses]
[gasps]

Why would you put that there?

Shoo. Go away.
[Emily] Look at you!

Splendid backpack!

It matches.
Cool.

Well, you are obviously
a young lady

of immaculate taste.
Thank you.

Bridwell's the name,
and welcome to my

Tentus Animalus Rescuus.

Is that Latin
for "Animal Rescue Tent"?

No, it's just regular words
with "us" on the end.

Makes me sound smartus.

So, what sort of animals
are you looking for?

A temperamental tortoise?
A stand-up chameleon?

Maybe something small,
cheap and stuffed?

I want them all.

Ah, yeah, we're not really
looking for a pet.

Perfect! Follow me.

The thing about animals is
that the best time to find them

is when you're not looking
for them.

Huh, does this tent
seem bigger on the inside?

That's ridiculous!
It's smaller on the outside.

[horse neighs]

Is that a baby giraffe?

Or a long-necked hyena.

I can't be sure
till I tell it a joke.

no sense of humor.

Here we are. [sighs]

This is it.

There's no animals in here.
That's right.

You said you weren't
looking for a pet.

And we're not.

So you won't be interested
in him.

Who?

[soft music playing]



You're just the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

Look at you.

Aw.

I got you.

Oh, he's so cute.

And... And so tiny.

And so red.

I love that he's red.


How did he get that way?

I don't know. I found him in
the park trying to be a pigeon.

I think he's lost his family,
so he's a little confused.


I'll be your family.
No, you will not.

Please, Uncle Casey?

He's so tiny,
he wouldn't bother anyone.

Mr. Bridwell, how big
is he gonna get?

Well, that depends, doesn't it?
On what?

On how much you love him.

Okay. Adorable. Put him back.

Please, just look
at this little tiny face.

I'm sorry. I'm new,
responsible Casey now,

and letting you get a little

radioactive micro-dog
is not responsible.

So give him back.

No, I'm not gonna
fall for that again.

Give me the dog.
[dog whimpers]

Be careful.

Well, thank you very much for giving me
the opportunity to crush my niece's dreams.

I always wondered what it
felt like to be the bad guy.

My pleasure.

[dog whimpers]

Oh, by the way,

do you know what sound

porcupines make
when they kiss?

"Ouch!"
[laughing]

Ah! Hyena.

Okay, come on.

Let's get you to school.
No word of this to anyone.

[school bell ringing]

[indistinct chatter]

OMG, did you bring
your garbage to school?

No, this is the recycling.

For the fund raiser?
Isn't that today?

Yeah, but nobody
actually does it.

The school just wants the money.

My mom wrote a check.
Mine, too.

Classic Food Stamp.


Hey! Don't listen to her.

She's just cranky because a
house fell on her wicked sister.


I think it's awesome
you actually did the work.

Really makes you stand out
around here.

It was one of the last things
I was hoping to do,

but thank you.

It's Owen, right?
[loudly] You know my name?

Did I say that out loud?
[chuckles]

Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

I collected cans, too.

Really? Where are they?

My dad threw them away.
Said I looked like an Asian Oliver Twist.

Oh, good job, Emily!
[school bell ringing]

Come on in, we're starting.

[cans clanking]
[students murmuring]

[kids gasping]

Can we get a cleanup
on aisle four?


We'll get this cleaned up.

Good talk.

[whimsical music playing]

What?

[dog whimpers]
What the... Hey, it's you!

How did you get in there?

You were in my bag all day?

They're gonna think
I stole you.

Who put you in here?
[panting]

Oh, my gosh, you are just the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

Maybe you could stay
for a little while, right?

[dog whimpers]
[chuckles]

[upbeat music playing]

Mr. Bridwell didn't tell me
your name.

So maybe you don't have one.

What about something cool
and old-fashioned?

Like...

Floyd!
[snorts, whimpers]

No? Okay.

Um, Ebenezer!
[grunts]

Sorry. Um, Ishmael.
It's from the Bible.

[grunts]
No.

Clifford.
[yelps]

You like Clifford?


Perfect for you.
[yelps]

Shh! No.
Uncle Casey will hear you.

Clifford, where'd you go?
What...


Hey, there's my retainer.

[Emily laughs]

You hungry, boy? Come on.

Perfect.

[Clifford snarling]

Clifford, no!

Those are my brand-new
slippers. Clifford!

Clifford, no, give it back.

Really?

I'm gonna call you Ebenezer
if you act like this.

Come on, drop it.
Drop it, Clifford.

Good boy.

Clifford?

Clifford! Where are you?


[Clifford grunts]

[light music playing]

Hmm.

Where'd you go?


Oh, no.


You didn't.
I didn't! I found him in my backpack.

I specifically said no to the dog
and you completely ignored me.

I swear, he just showed up.

Oh, it just "showed up", huh?

What is that? What are you doing?
Air quotes.

It's a thing that grown-ups do when
they say something that they don't mean.

Please, Uncle Casey,
can't he just stay for one night?

No! Absolutely not.
I promised your mom.

No, please.

[thunder rumbling]

I'm not gonna fall
for your little girl powers.


Oh! Okay, one night.

And then, first thing
in the morning,

he is going back to that weird old
man that we met in the animal tent.

Mm, saying that out loud
makes us going in there

seem like such
a poor choice.

Why? I don't understand.
Why can't I just keep him?

Because you can't have a dog!

One night. That's it.

Don't you...

[door slams shut]

[thunder rumbles]

[rain pattering]

[melancholy music playing]

[Emily sobbing]

[Clifford whimpering]

I wish we were big and strong,

and the world
couldn't hurt us.

[thunder rumbling]


[thunder rumbling]

[whimsical music plays]

[music rises]




[Clifford whimpers]

[Emily grunting]

Oh, my gosh.
[yawns]

Clifford?

Wait, wait. I'm going to wake up.
It's all in my head.

I'm dreaming.
I'm going to wake up

in three, two...

Oh, my gosh, I'm not dreaming.
This is real.

Clifford, it's really you.

How did this happen?
How are you so huge?

I mean, it's crazy,
but it's great.

I did wish
for you to be big,

but I didn't mean
big on the outside.

I meant, like,

mentally big.


Clifford.

[Emily chuckling]

What are you doing?

[thuds]
No! My bed!

Clifford, no,
that's my mom's pillow!

Clifford, drop it.

Come on, be a good boy
and drop it.

Give it back!

[Emily yelps]
[Clifford whines]


Ew!


Bless you.

Oh, no! My computer!
[clatters]

Don't wag your tail. Sit, boy, sit.
[Clifford whines]

Clifford!

Clifford, just

be quiet, stay here, okay?

Shh. I'll be right back, okay?
Just shh, shh, shh.

Casey! Casey! Casey!

The meter's broken.
Casey!

[Casey groans] It's 7:30. Huh!
We're gonna be late for school.

Casey.
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up!

Um, about the dog...

You know,
I've been thinking about that.

And I don't want to be the no guy.
That's just not who I am.

So if you really want to keep that weird
little thing, then it's fine with me.

So I can keep him?
You just got to tell your mom I knew nothing about it, okay?

You snuck it back here, you hid it from me.
I had no idea it was here.

I don't know if she's gonna believe that.
She is.

The thing is tiny.
It's completely plausible that I would...


Run!

Come on.
We got to get out of here!

There's a monster in the apartment!
Casey, this is the dog...

Uncles and children first!

Stay back! Stay back.

...from the tent.

But last night it was...

Yeah, I think something happened to him.
You think?

He's the same dog
he was last night,

he's just a little bit bigger.

"A little bit bigger."

It is the size
of a hippopotamus.

Listen, he's not gonna hurt you, okay?
He's harmless.

He's the same dog
he was last night.

Stay.

[cell phone ringing]

Oh, God. It's your mom.

What am I gonna say?

I don't know.
Uh. Just act natural.

Act natural.
[whimpers]

Shoo. Stay still.


[ringing continues]

Okay.

Remember. Natural.

Hey, girl.

It's Maggie.
I know, girl.

Why do you keep
calling me "girl"?

What? That's just a thing that
I say when I'm super chill.


I just wanted to call to make sure
you were on the way to school.

We're walking to the subway now.
[Emily] Clifford, no!

Not gonna lose her this time.
[Maggie] <i>That's not funny.</i>

You're right, that incident is not
something we should joke about.

Clifford, no! Whoa!
But we are being so safe right now.

[clattering]
What is that noise?

Nothing.

But we're at our stop.
Uh, bye, girl!

[softly] Get up.
Okay, bye.

Okay. You, sit.

No, don't say that!


Somehow I thought
you'd be better in a crisis.

We are finding
that Bridwell guy immediately.

Why?

So we can get rid of that.

But you just said
I could keep him.

Yeah, that was
before he 'roided up.

Oh, come on.

How is there nothing
on this guy?

He doesn't even show up
on Google.

"Bridwell's Animal Rescue"...
nothing!

You can't give people pets that go
nuclear and then not be on the Internet.

That is so irresponsible.
Even by my standards.

[Clifford whines]
Oh!

That means he likes you.
Oh, great.

[knock on door]

Who is it?
Packard.

Oh, no, it's our psycho super. We can't have
pets in the building... we'll get evicted!

to fix the dishwasher.

Coming in!
One second!

Not on my watch. Hide the dog.


[dramatic music playing]


Oh! Maybe I should do
my English accent.

No!

[in British accent] Hello.
You must be Mr. Packard.

Who are you?

[in American accent]
Uh, Casey.

Um, Maggie's sister. Brother.

Um, this is not a great time.
It's now or never.

Never?

[door closes]

Well, what the heck
is going on in here?

Oh, we were just doing
a little <i>feng shui.</i>

It's Chinese
for "moving things."

The dishwasher's right there.

Yeah, but the water cutoff
is in the bedroom closet.

Don't... Don't go in here.
No.

Why not?

It's private.
It's haunted.

There's a lot of girl stuff in there
that I wouldn't want you to see.

Yeah.

I can do it, though.
Yeah! Thanks, Uncle Casey.

Just get in there and give it
a little... [clicks tongue]

You know, he's family.
[Casey] Yeah.

So, the, um...

So, the dishwasher!

So, it makes, like,
this weird crackling noise when it drains.


Shh.

No, no, no. Stop!
[thumping]




Everything's under control!
Just shutting off the valve.


Must be these old pipes, huh?

What the heck is going on
in there?

into my room now!




Dog?

No, um...

That is just me.
I don't believe in deodorant.

Why mask our natural essence?
In fact, we should smell each other.

Bring it in.
Mmm, no. No!

Okay.


[Clifford whimpers softly]


[bottle rolling]

Yeah, I think I found
the problem.

I got to order a part.
And I will have to return.

Well, thank you very much
for coming.

You are a super super.

Ow.

[Emily] Bye!
Bye now!



This is the craziest thing
I have ever seen,

and I've been to Burning Man.

If we can't find Bridwell,
how are we gonna return him?


Wait, return him?

We can't abandon him.
We're all he's got.

We just need to make him
small again.

He needs to see a vet.

A vet?
[Emily] Yeah.

We don't know
what's going on with him.

What if he's really sick?
[groans]

What if he's still growing?

[distorted voice] What if he
grows to be a hundred feet tall?

[distorted panting]

Okay. We'll take him to a vet.

But after that, we are finding
Bridwell and we are giving him back...

Whoa!

[chuckles]
[Casey sighs]

...his giant dog.

Come on.

[light music playing]

[Clifford panting]
Nice job with the belts.

Lucky your mom went through the
Madonna phase in the '80s, huh?


Uh, shouldn't we try
to hide him or something?

Nah. It's New York.
No one'll even notice.

No, no. I don't care if it's Johnny
Appleseed, don't touch my petunias.

[Clifford grunts]

[Emily] You live here?
Haven't you ever seen a mobile home before?

Not like this one.
[sighs]

My girlfriend and I broke up,
and what with my college loans, I...

Mmm-hmm.
Look, this is a valid,

financially responsible
life choice

which your mother does not
need to know about. Okay?

[Clifford whines]

Oh, you're judging me as well.

In.
Come on, boy.

Just down the front here.
[clattering]

No, oh! Or stick your big
fat butt right on my bed.

No! Clifford.


financially responsible life choice.

[Clifford barks]

Emily!

Owen. What are you doing here?

I thought you were sick,
so I was gonna bring you your homework.

And I also skipped P.E.

Which I'm suddenly realizing
makes me look

a lot more desperate
than I anticipated.

So you're not sick.
No, we're going to the vet.

Don't you need an animal
for that?

[Clifford grunts]


[people murmuring
in background]

Dogzilla!

[Casey] No!
[girl] Is that a dog?


Nothing to see here, folks, just a big
red puppy. Nothing to be afraid of.

[whines]
In.

We're trying to keep this quiet until
we can get him small again. So...

Shh.
This is so cool. You guys got to let me come.

This is the kind of education
you can't get in a classroom.

I've seen TED talks
about this.

Sorry, pal. I got enough on my
plate keeping one kid alive.

There is no way...

[Owen screams]

Okay, I guess
he's coming with.

[upbeat pop music playing]

Don't you dare.
[barks]

Clifford, no. No fetch.

No fetch!




Bad doggy!



[people screaming]

[man] That's a good boy!
[Emily] Clifford, no!




Oh!

[man grunting]

How has he
not popped that yet?

[body ball pops]
Ah. There we are.

Clifford, put him down.

Drop the ball.

Drop the ball!
Clifford, drop it.

Unbelievable.
Good boy.

No, bad boy. Very bad boy.

[man 2] He's cute.
Right over here.

[indistinct chatter]
[laughs]

[Clifford whimpers]
[Owen] What is he doing?

What is he doing?
[Clifford sniffing]

Uh-oh.

[Owen groans]

Awesome.
Not awesome.

[splashes]
[Emily] Oh!

[Owen grunts]

Oh, I hope I'm not around
for number two.

TV interview

was brilliant, Mr. Tieran.

I mean, I don't want to have
high expectations,

but I'm excited
about what I'm gonna see.

Uh, well, unfortunately,
Mr. Tieran, we haven't seen

exactly the kind of
genetically induced growth

we were hoping for.


[Tieran] That's a two-headed goat.
[bleating]

We're trying to feed the world and
you're creating more mouths to feed?

I guess you could look at it that way.
Oh, I am.

[goat bleating]

And it's looking back at me
with four eyes.

That's a little unsettling.

What's our goal?

Well, to feed the world.
Stop talking.

Our goal is to grow giant food
through genetic engi...



How much money have we spent?

Is it...

$400 million.

That is so much money, huh?
I know!

Surely you have something to show for it. Right?
Well...

So far, sir, not...
I heard a "so far."

Did you hear "so far"?
I heard "so far".

And what that tells me
is we have not failed.

We just have not succeeded
so far!

Can I get an amen?
Amen!

Not you.
I was talking to them.

So with that $400 million,
what have we produced?

Larger chickens,
cows that poop chocolate, what?

Why don't I just show you?
Oh! That is what I like to hear, okay?

Well, this sheep at least
has one head. That's a bonus.

And what do we have here?
Thicker wool that shears itself?

Fur that smells
like Santa Claus? What?

Uh, not exactly.

We included her because she's m...
Why, Albert?

She's m...
She's what?

She's...

mean.

She's mean?

She's nasty.

Well, now you're just
lying to me.

No.
You're telling me that this gentle, sweet...

[sheep growls]
[screams]

Neat, huh? Kinda cool?
[thumping]

That's not cool. Stop it!


This is my childhood!


Colette. Yes.

From the look on your face,

I'm assuming you have
more good news.

[sighs]
You need to see this.

That can't be real.

the Internet.

There's a ten-foot dog
in upper Manhattan.

Oh, my...

I smell your hair.
Sorry.

grow could make our food grow.

And then save Lyfegro.


Please find him. Yes!

[dog whimpers]

[Clifford slobbering]


Eh, yeah, um, eh, well...

He's, uh... um, well...

Whoo!

Are you gonna examine him?

Yes. I am.
Because I'm a veterinarian!

That's what I do,
I examine... animals.

I'm gonna take a look inside your mouth, buddy.
[snarls]

Oh, easy.
You want to maybe tell him?

Oh, yeah. Clifford.
That's not gonna...


Oh, maybe have a little
more faith in the kiddies.

Good job there, buddy.

All right, let me take
a look there.


Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Yeah!

Yes, they're large teeth
on a big red dog.

Is that a medical opinion?
It sounded very scientific.

All right, yeah, so,
why don't we get you on the scale, bud?

But slowly!
[crackles]

[kids] Oh!
[Clifford whines]

It's just the platinum edition
of the X-9000.

Yeah, sorry about that.
[vet] No problem.

I'm just gonna write...

"heavy."
[Clifford whines]

All right.

Yeah, why don't you
take his temperature?

What? Why? I...

You know him a little better.
Uh...

Where?
You know.

No, I don't "know"
because I'm not a vet.

Well, in the animal
temperature-taking place?

Which is...
Rhymes with "nut-hole."

[Clifford grunts]


No way.
You don't wanna... Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

Don't even worry
about that, Clifford.

Why don't I just listen to his heart?
Yes!

That! Yes.
Let's do that. Let's do that.

I'm gonna listen to your heart
now, buddy. [blowing]

here we go.

[heart beating rapidly]
Oh.

Yeah! Clifford, Clifford,
Clifford, Clifford...

[both clear throat]

Oh, sorry.

Well, I mean, I got to say,

besides being big and red,
this dog is healthy as,

well, healthy as a horse.
So you don't know what made him grow like this?


Live near a toxic waste dump?

On top of a burial ground?

I saw this movie...
Okay, I think we're done here.

All right.

Crazy idea: How about
we leave Clifford here

with this professional

until, I don't know,
your mom comes home?

And if he hasn't shrunken back to a normal
size, then you can figure it out without me.

Casey!
That is cold.

[Clifford snarls]

Why don't I
finish up the examination?

You guys can just go
wait in the other room.

All right. Thank you so much.
Thanks.


the easy part now

and get you
out of here, Clifford.

That's one big handsome fella
you got there.


Sign here.

Very good, very good.
[sneezes]

Yeah, who wants a treat, huh?
You want a treat?

There you go, buddy.

Yeah. Good job. Okay.
[whimpers]

No, no,
you'll get another treat

in a little while.
[sniffing]

Another treat
in a little while.

You'll get it in a little...
[Clifford whines]

[indistinct yelling]



You know, I've got to say,

I've never seen a dog
that big before.

He was tiny last night.

[whimsical music playing]

Really?

You didn't happen to get him from Bridwell, did you?
How'd you know?

Sweetheart, I have been working in
this office for more than 20 years.

Whenever anyone brings
a unique animal in,

it always seems to come
from Bridwell.

This one guy
couldn't speak a word

until Bridwell gave him
a parakeet.

That bird kept repeating
positive affirmations daily.

Now the guy
can't stop talking!

[vet exclaims]
Another woman, she couldn't walk.

She couldn't even move!

Bridwell gave her
a spider monkey.

Every night...
Lucille, help!

her feet,

and since then,
she's taken up tap dancing.

Wow, this guy's like a wizard!
Do you think he could make Clifford small again?

Are you kidding?
That's nothing for a man like Bridwell.

The guy
could perform miracles!

How do we find him?
You don't.

He's more of the
there-when-you-need-him type of guy.

What do you do,
say his name three times and rub a lamp?


Have you got any information
on your computer?

What kind of dumb question is that?
Dumb question?

He just suggested
rubbing a lamp.

That's it!
I know how to find him.

Bridwell was at our school yesterday.
He set up his tent there.

So that must mean he had to fill
out paperwork with his info on it.

So the information is on the school's computer.
Exactly!

We hit the school fast,
get the info on Bridwell, and we bounce.

I'll get Clifford
something to eat.

Is it safe to leave
the keys up there?

Who's gonna
want to steal this?

Sometimes you pray
for a miracle

to save your company
from ruin,

and then you actually get it!

But we don't
have him yet, sir.

Oh, come on, it's hard to hide
a ten-foot red dog, Colette.

And what is this?

It's an I.D. chip.
It's an I.D. chip.

And when this little guy finds its
way into our new large friend...


...the dog becomes
Lyfegro's property.

And red becomes
my new favorite color.

Mr. Tieran.

What?
[technician] Sir?

Yeah.
[technician] Take a look at this.

This girl appears with the dog

in 67% of the images that we've examined.
Oh, that's unfortunate.

Now, I've traced the crest on her
uniform to an elite private school.

Ugh! That's a litter
of terrible.

And...
Oh. All right.

"Emily Elizabeth Howard."

Bingo!

[upbeat music playing]

that is a lovely broach!

Could you break a 20?

There's kids in the hall selling peanut
brittle, and I got a thing for P britty.

Peanuts? Ugh!
Yeah.

Just down the hall.
Far as you can go!

She does not like peanuts.

Nice job.

I'll lift the intel...
stealth mode.

They'll never even know
we were here.

That would've sounded
so much cooler

if you weren't holding
a SpongeBob flash drive.

Shh.

Working.
[typing]

[sighs]
[sarcastically] Charming.


[car door closes]
Hello, good sir!

How are you?

I'm gonna guess that you're
either the superintendent

or you're a part of the New York
Lantern Preservation Society. [laughs]

What do you want, smart aleck?
Okay.

I need some information on one
of your tenants, please.

Well, if you think I'm gonna
divulge some confidential infor...

There we are.

What do you need to know?
Yes.

If you could just let me know
if you've seen these beings.

[Packard sighs]

I knew I smelled a dog.


[light music playing]


And one more, please.

Thanks.

[woman gasping]

Stay! Stay, stay!

Dog! [screams]



Hey, Food Stamp.

Thought you
weren't here today.

Hi, Florence.

Oh, you know, if you need
extra food for home,

I'm sure we could organize
a food drive or something.

I'm kind of in a rush.

[dramatic music playing]

[students exclaiming]

[sets tray down]

Do you know
how much this blouse cost?

I'm sorry. It was an accident.

You're an accident!
You shouldn't even be here.

Why do you get to come here for
free when everybody else has to pay?

[students exclaiming]


How'd you get in here?

all over Instagram!

[girl 1] Is that Emily's dog?

[Emily] Come on, let's go.
[Clifford whimpers]

Clifford, what?

What are you doing?
Why are you pushing me?

Can we pet him?

Um, sure.

This is my dog, Clifford.

[Sid] How is he so big?
He's so cute.

I love him!

Oh, this is perfect.

The biggest nobody in school

has the biggest freak
in the world.

I guess freaks of a feather...
He's not a freak!

[students gasp]
What did you say to me?

You're just mad 'cause he stole
all the attention from you.

[students laugh] Whoa!

that means he likes you.


Burn!

[students laughing]


Okay, time to go.

Yes, definitely time to go.

[light music playing]

Okay. We can't risk Packard
seeing Clifford.

Owen, you stay in the truck.

Wait a minute. What...

Oh, and maybe get Clifford some water.
Thanks.

Okay, we plug
into your laptop,

download the info on Bridwell,
and then get out of here.

Oh, my God.

No.
We're evicted?

be happening.

[doorknob rattles]


Now I've really done it.


This looks very complicated,
Mr. Jarvis!

I'm not even sure if you're on the
right step for what I was reading you.

Did you even read the legal
disclaimer on self-installation?

Certainly, Mrs. Jarvis!
In what world would I ever...

[both scream]

Somebody help! Somebody help him, please!
[Mr. Jarvis screams]

Somebody help!

What are you doing?

Priscilla!
Jeron, please!

[Mrs. Jarvis] Somebody grab a ladder!
[Mr. Jarvis] Somebody!

Clifford!
[screams] He's slipping!

[Mr. Jarvis screams]
[Mrs. Jarvis] Jeron, please!

Hold on, man!



Jeron!

[Mr. Jarvis panting]

[crowd gasping]

You just got fetched
by a big red dog!

[crowd applauding]


Thank you.

Whose giant dog is this?

It's Emily's!
It's Emily's dog.

Emily! Your dog
just saved my life!

[crowd cheering]

Clifford?

did you see that?

It was the greatest
Frisbee catch ever!

Clifford, good boy. Good boy.

Thank goodness.

This is my dog, Clifford,
and that's my Uncle Casey.

Wait, Packard
lets you have this dog?

Um, not exactly.
But we're trying to figure it out.

Oh, Owen, we couldn't get the computer.
We were completely locked out.

[Owen] Really?
Yeah.

All right, I'll try
to figure something out.

Thanks.

[Clifford whimpers]

[indistinct chatter]

Excuse me?
Yes.

Can me and Emily
borrow your computer?

Of course you may.

[man 1] Let me take
some action shots

as I'm walking with him.
[man 2] Yeah?

It's not your fault.

Oh, it is my specialty.

Screwing stuff up
for your mom.

I bet you didn't know your mom
got a scholarship to Oxford.

She did?
Yeah.

Wanted to go back to England
for college.

And then our mom died,
Dad went to pieces.

So she stayed here
to help raise me.

She sacrificed everything.

This is how I repay her:
"Surprise! You're homeless."

That's why no one
ever believes in me, Em.

Holy cow!

Guys! I got into the file!

I found a letter that Bridwell
sent to the school.

But check this out: One of the days he
said he wasn't available is tomorrow.

Because he's gonna be at St. Benedict's
Hospital for a prior appointment.

So we can find Bridwell tomorrow!
Exactly.

[Owen] I'll be right back.
[dramatic music playing]

<i>We've got eyes on her.</i>

[Owen] Mrs. Jarvis!
What? No.

Have you not listened
to a word that I've said?

Emily, we're not playing this game anymore. This is over.
No.

We're calling Animal Control,
a zoo, a carnival, whatever.

Oh! Hello!

You must be Emily Elizabeth.

Who are you?

I'm Zac Tieran, from Lyfegro.

It is so nice to meet you.

Here's my card.

You are a lifesaver,
young lady.

I cannot thank you enough
for finding our dog.

Your dog?
One of our clumsy janitors left the gate open

and this large fella
slipped away from the lab,

didn't ya, big guy? [laughs]
[barks]

Okay.

So,

I'm sure he has been
a huge inconvenience,

so if I may,

I would like
to offer you this.

I'm really coming around
to this guy.

[Emily] Hold on.
All right.

Well, don't hold on. We...

Can I have a minute?
Sure.

[Casey] What are you doing?
Ugh, I hate children.

[tires screech]

This fixes everything.
Clifford goes home,

we bribe our way back
into the apartment,

no one knows any of this
ever happened,

and, well, I will take a very
small babysitting fee off the top.

Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

You're lying.

Excuse me? What?
Ah, that's a little strong.

You said when Clifford escaped
he was big.

I found him when he was small.

Oh. That's weird.

Everything okay, Emily?

Hold your roll.
I was talking to Emily, my friend.

Everything's fine.
Well, good. I'm Alonso with the Neighborhood Watch.

We're watching you! But we're not seeing much.
[Tieran] Oh.

I tried to be nice. Albert!
[dramatic music rises]

Sorry.
[Clifford whimpers]

[barks]
Thank you.

Clifford, run!

No. No, no, no!
Emily!

Get him! Get him!

now!

Clifford! Come here, boy!
[Tieran] Come on!

[Raul] Come, everybody!
[Tieran] What do I pay you people for?


In there! Go!

Oh, no.
[Casey] Get into the truck! Go!

Okay.
[Owen] Hurry, let's go!

Clifford, come on,
we got to get to the truck!

Come on!
Come on, come on!


That'll hold them.


[upbeat pop music playing]




[groans]
Chips!

Don't make me hurt you.
Alonso!


[screams]
Raul!

Oh, my bad.



[engine starts]
What are you doing?

I'm getting Clifford out of here.
You know how to drive?

If Casey can do it,
how hard can it be?

Oh, Lord.

[engine revving]

Try that stick thingamabobber.
My dad uses it sometimes.


Whoa, whoa!

[Owen yells]

Whoa!

Okay, not "R".

This is both unsafe
and illegal!

That's two firsts for me.

Oh.

Ow!
Sorry.

[both grunting]


Whew.


[Emily] I... I am sure we're fine.
[Owen] No, we're not fine.

We're not fine!
We're not fine!

Her mother is literally
gonna kill me.

doesn't have airbags.

Please keep that in mind
while we're crashing.

Cops! Be cool.

[breathing heavily]

What are you doing?
Two hands on the wheel!

Two hands! Even I know that!

Two hands!

[Emily] They're coming!
Uh, take a left! Take a left!

[both screaming]
[groans, gulps]


That's my building up ahead!

Garage is open.
Turn left right here!

The garage is right there!
Turn now!


[both grunt]

do that again.

the toxicity reports, right?

[Maggie] Yes, I do.
[cell phone ringing]

It's Emily's school.
Just one...

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's fine.

Oh, hi, Mrs. McKinley.

Hi, Maggie. I just wanted
to check on Emily,

see how she's feeling

since she wasn't in school today.
What?

[elevator dings]

Oh, for the love of Mike!

Siobhan, he's with us.

Put the Swiffer down.

Are you insane?
You're driving now?

What are you upset about?

I still can't get
my butt cheeks to unclench!

Where are we?
Is this a museum?

It's just a pied-Ã -terre.

You live here?

Yeah.
[cell phone rings]

Oh, geez.

Your turn.
What? I don't know what to say!

I'd go with anything
but the truth.

Hey, girl!

Emily, I just got a call
from the school,

and they said
that you weren't there today.

What? That's crazy talk, girl!
Of course I was at school.

Okay.
You know what? Casey can explain.

You're a better liar than me.

Hey! There must have been
some confusion at the office.

I heard they had
a peanut scare today.

<i>But I will straighten
it out Monday.</i>

No problemo.
[barking]

Brutus! No!

Is that a dog?
A dog?

What? No. No. No.

It's the, uh,

dishwasher.

Just try kicking it.

I think he wants
to smell Clifford's...

you know.

Okay. Hey, Brutus.

Look, there. It stopped.

You know...



Good boy.

By the way, have you thought
about finding a new apartment?

It might be time for a change.

[kids exclaiming]
[screams]

Uh, sorry.

Just checked my phone battery.

It's on, like, 1%
if you lose me.

[Brutus yelping]

[Clifford grunts]
[Owen] Whoa! Brutus!

Well, you don't
see that every day.



He's okay. He's okay.

Really?
[Clifford burps]

Maybe it's time to feed him.

thank you so much for seeing us, Captain.

Chief.
Sure, of course.

You telling me this dog is yours?
Absolutely.

We were in the middle of an
experimental trial when it escaped.

This creature
is a medical mutant.

Medical mutant?
That's right.

And I'm worried
that this mutation

could potentially
jump species.

Jump species?

We need to capture this animal

and return it to my lab
as soon as possible

or the consequences
could be catastrophic.

Picture this, okay?
You're going outside.

Cockroaches that size...
Ugh!

...flying around
the air! Okay?

Rats that size walking around
the grocery store with you.


Flying rats!
Fl...

Let me make a call.
[Tieran] Great, make a call.


He eats like an animal.

Well, he is an animal.

I'm talking about him.

What?

[indistinct TV chatter]

[newsreader on TV] <i>We take you to breaking news.</i>
Hey, guys. Look!

<i>I'm Chief Watkins,
New York City Police Department.</i>

<i>We are offering
a $25,000 reward</i>

<i>for any information
leading to the capture</i>

<i>of the big red dog.</i>

<i>The safety of the citizens...</i>
And look who's there.

<i>...of New York
is our primary concern.</i>

<i>We are currently working
in conjunction with Lyfegro.</i>

That is a very slappable face.

<i>Please, if you see something,
say something.</i>

[Mr. Yu] Owen! I'm home!
<i>Any questions?</i>

Dad!

Hey! [chuckles]

Who are you?

Um, this is Casey
and that's Emily.

[Mr. Yu] Emily?
Yeah.

As in the Emily?
Dad!

Sorry.

He's never mentioned you.
Ever.

Not once.

So, can they spend the night?
They've got a problem.

What's the problem?
[glasses shatter]

[Brutus barking]

[light music playing]

I withdraw the question.

owns this place?

500 acres.

A lot of space, tons of animals.

It's perfect for Clifford.
And it's thousands of miles away.

the cops are after us.

[speaking Mandarin]

[in English] Okay, bye.

Okay, so things are falling
into place.

My shipping company has a
freighter docked in Newark.

Leaves for Hong Kong
tomorrow night.

Owen showed you our place
outside Shanghai.

It's fully staffed.
Clifford would be safe.

We're not gonna
send Clifford away.

Emily.
We're not doing that!


Would you mind
if I spoke with Emily alone?

Of course. Come on, Owen,
I'll tuck you in.

Dad!

I never tuck him in. Ever.

Let's go, big man.

Good night.
[Owen] Bye, guys.

We're having words
about that debacle.

Debacle?

China's not that far away.
Really?

Okay, that's a terrible lie.
It is very far away.

But this is definitely
what's best for him.

I don't care.

Clifford came to me

when I was alone
and had no friends.

He's the best part of my life.
I'm not gonna abandon him.

We don't have a choice.

We've been evicted.

And now,
according to the news,

we're, like, actual fugitives.

Bridwell could help us!

You heard Lucille at the vet's office.
He can do it!

We just need to find him.

Emily...
Casey,

what if you found someone
who was so full of love

they made you feel
like you could do anything?

How would you feel
if you had to let that go?

[melancholy music playing]


Okay.

We'll go to the hospital,
look for Bridwell.

But if we can't find him,
or he can't help,

Clifford's got to get
on that boat tomorrow night.

Deal?

Deal.

Looks like we're on the couch,
T-bone.

Whoa. This place
is $27 mil on Zillow?

Hey, T-bone,

does Owen
have an older sister?

[snarls]
Okay.

Just asking for a friend.
Understood.

[snarls]
Dude. Forget I asked.

[upbeat pop music playing]


Owen, you stay with Clifford.
We'll go find Bridwell.

Why do you always
leave me behind?

Because it's the
kind of education

you can't get
in a classroom.

[Casey whispering] Act natural.

you sense things.

You sense any chemistry
between me and Emily?

Because I sense...

[Clifford farts]


This is what killed
the dinosaurs!

There are rules!

You can't let one rip
in confined space!


that was really uncool.

[people clamoring]

Clifford! Get in the truck.

Are you looking for someone?

Um, older guy, silver hair.

Tall. Kinda speaks in riddles.

That... That's his tie!
He wears a polka-dot bow tie.

Oh.
What?

The man with that tie?
Your friend?

[melancholy music playing]

He passed away this morning.

No.

That's impossible.



He was so kind and magical.

How could he die?

If there's a memorial,
I could email or something.

Yeah, thanks.

Uh, here you go.

What about Clifford?

I can't believe it.

Bridwell was our only hope.

[police sirens blaring]

[dramatic music playing]

[Casey sighs]
I bet that's for us.

It'll be fine. Come on.

[engine revving]

I just can't believe
that Bridwell is,

you know.

[police siren blaring]

We can go back
to my apartment and hide.

Owen, the New York City
Police force is after us.

There's no more hiding.

If they find us, they're gonna
hand Clifford over to Tieran.

So what do we do?

No.
Em.

I'm not gonna give him up!

We've got to do
what's best for him.

I'm what's best for him.

Not if you can't
keep him safe.

[melancholy music playing]

Call your father.

[melancholy music continues]

[Mr. Yu] All right,
everything's been arranged.

Colin will stay with Clifford from the tug to
the freighter, then all the way to Shanghai.

He'll be met at the port
by my staff,

and they'll bring
him to the house.

we got to get going! [claps]

Mr. Yu, we can't
thank you enough.

You're welcome.

Bye, Clifford.

I hope to see you
again someday.

[Clifford whimpers]

Okay, go wait in the car.

I'm sorry it worked out like this, Emily.
Thank you.

Hey.

[Clifford whines]

I know you don't
understand, Clifford.

It's just...
It's not safe for you here.

You're just too big.

And if they find you,
they'll do really bad things to you.

I can't let that happen.

[Clifford whines]

There are no other dogs
like you.

And people, they just...

They don't like things
that are different.

[Clifford whining]

What's the matter?
What's he doing?

I think he's trying
to be small.

[Clifford whines]
[voice breaks] I'm sorry I let you down, Clifford.

I thought I could save you
and I couldn't.


We have to be big and strong.

Remember?

So that the world
can't hurt us.

You have to go
with these men now.

It'll be okay.
[Clifford yips]


Real proud of you.

[Clifford whines]

[melancholy music rises]


Bye, Clifford!

I love you with all my heart!

Be good for me, okay?


[Clifford howls]

Apparently, the county
was sued in 1994.

[reporter chatting on TV]

[woman] Maggie! Is that Emily?
[Maggie] What?

capture of this Internet sensation.</i>

<i>The city-wide search continues in New York City...</i>
[Steve] What's the matter?

<i>...for the big red dog.</i>
That's my daughter.

<i>He was last seen in Harlem.</i>

You go, yes.
[Maggie] Yeah.

Didn't get much sleep, huh?

Breakfast?


I know you don't drink coffee, but feels
like now might be the time to start.

He's gonna
be happy there.

You know who's not
gonna be happy?

My mom. Living in a van.

Nah, I think she'll
get used to the van life.

Sleeping on the floor.
Peeing in a bucket.

I woke up to some fun texts
from her this morning.

Yeah.

"Please call, right now."

All caps, exclamation,
angry face, angry face,

gun emoji.

Do you think she might be mad?

You want to finish
getting ready?

The maid comes around ten.

Ah, guy from the hospital sent
the info on Bridwell's memorial.

I don't want to see it.

Wait a sec.

That does not look
like Bridwell.

It's probably just him when
he was younger.

Meh.

[light music playing]

That's not Bridwell.

Not Bridwell.
Definitely not Bridwell.

The patient in the hospital
must've got the wrong guy.

So if that's not Bridwell,
that means...


This guy's dead, which is
tragic, but Bridwell's alive.

Bridwell is alive!
Yeah!

Feels weird high-fiving
the dead!

There's still hope for Clifford!
Let's focus on that.

Yes.
R.I.P. Hamilton Wilder.

[Both] Long live Bridwell!
Yes!

Guys!
Owen, Bridwell's alive!


Online... I researched...

I found... Bridwell...
the park.

Okay. Again. With sentences.
[Owen inhales deeply]

Bridwell is alive,
and his tent is in Manhattan Bridge Park

at the Freedom Festival.
[sighs]


Emily! Come quick!

<i>The giant crimson dog was
stopped earlier this morning</i>

<i>by the authorities on a freighter.</i>
[Raul] Can you believe this?

What?
<i>No one is certain how or why he got aboard,</i>

<i>but it seems an effort
was being made</i>

<i>to transport him
out of the country.</i>

<i>The enormous dog
is being returned</i>

<i>to his home at Lyfegro labs,</i>

<i>the biotech firm
that created him.</i>

No! No, we have
to help Clifford.

Uncle Casey, we have to save him.
They'll hurt him!

Yeah. We do.

I guess we're paying Lyfegro
a visit.

I'm in. I'll go get the van.

[uplifting music playing]


Looks like Harlem wants
its big red dog back.

[cell phone ringing]

Guess who.
Let me talk to her.

Hi, Mom!
[Maggie] <i>Emily, what on earth is going on?</i>

Clifford's in trouble.
I'm in the taxi on the way from JFK.

There's no time to explain.
[Alonso] Everybody, get in!

[Maggie] <i>I am an hour away...</i>
Mom, I can handle this.

[Maggie] <i>Handle what? You're twelve years old.</i>
I got this.

And besides, Uncle Casey's with me.
[Maggie] <i>And I am so sorry,</i>

but, my darling, you... Emily?
[line disconnects]

I'm grounded for life,
aren't I?


It's in Brooklyn Yards,
off Vanderbilt.

Okay, I'll meet you
over there.

[Mrs. Crullerman] Hey!

Get out of my way.

They should have left
that dog alone.

Ooh. Now they're in trouble.

All right, let's start
sequencing its DNA.


Hello! How are you?

It's okay.


I got a speech, but what I have
to say comes from the heart,

and I apologize
if I get emotional.

We here at Lyfegro,
we've got one mission.

It's to feed the world.

Hey, Mark, I like your tie.

[dramatic music playing]

team of scientists...

[Tieran continues
indistinctly]


Whoa! You carry bolt cutters?

Never leave the house
without 'em.

You live in a truck.

Zip it, Owen.

And to prove that,

I'm sure you saw
that beautiful,

magnificent creature
walking by, who... [chuckles]

playfully escaped
from our lab two days ago.

And I tell ya,

we are very, very thankful
for that big red dog.

Okay. Now we just need
a diversion.

We can handle that. Right, Mr. Jarvis?
Yes, we can, Mrs. Jarvis.


[Mr. Jarvis] We'll go make some
trouble at the press conference.

You have an opportunity

to make a sizeable return
on Lyfegro's investment.

Thank you so much.
[Mrs. Jarvis] Uh, Mr. Tieran.

Mr. Tieran!
Yes.

Will you please address the lawsuit
that's being filed against you?

Lawsuit? I don't...

[dramatic music continues]

[doorknob rattles]

It's locked. Don't worry.
I got a solution.

We learned how to pick locks in magic class.
I bet you did.

[Mr. Jarvis] We'll be filing a
class-action lawsuit against Mr. Tieran,

Lyfegro Research Facilities,

and any and all...
Guys, we've got bogies.

Yeah, I don't speak legalese.

We've already named Emily Elizabeth
Howard as head class representative,

and we've attached an assault and battery
claim, inclusive of ethical violations.

[Mr. Jarvis] Hey, let me go. Get your hands off her!
[Tieran] This is unfortunate.

This is way too focused on me.
Look at that!

What is the matter with you?

You're gonna set off
the fire alarm!

There's another one. Just...

[alarm blaring]

Security inside the building, what's going on?
[guard 1] Go, go, go.

Check all the doors!
[guard 2] Yes, sir! On it. Doing it now.


[alarm continues blaring]

What's going on?
[clamoring]


Ah, look. It's a cute sheep.


Look.

[growls]
[screaming]

Holy sheep.


I'm out.
Step aside. I know sheep.

Come here, <i>mamachka.</i> Come to mama.
Yeah, come here, come here.

[speaking Russian]

[singing in Russian]

You see? Everybody likes
condensed milk.

Go get it. [laughs]

Yes, even the can tastes good,
doesn't it?

[guard 1] Sectors three
through five clear.

[guard 2] It's a false alarm
at the loading dock.

Copy that.

False alarm
at the loading dock.

<i>Resetting all systems.</i>

[man] Whoa!
[Emily] Clifford!

Sorry, my friends,
we're taking the dog.

I've got 30,000 volts
that says you're not.

[crackling]
[grunts]

I've got a plastic hand.
But I have a real one.


[Mrs. Crullerman] No!

Oh!
It's heavy because it's condensed, <i>tovarishch.</i>

Okay, anyone in a lab coat...

[crackles]
...take a hike.

Okay.

Huh.


Are you okay?

Clifford.

[soft music playing]

Clifford?

Clifford!

You're okay!

[uplifting music playing]

Clifford, buddy.

I know, I know.



[Emily chuckles]

Aw!
[yips]

Hey, buddy. I'm happy, too.
[Casey] I don't want to break this up

because it is, like,
the most adorable thing

I've ever seen, but how are we gonna get
him to Bridwell in Manhattan Bridge Park?

Listen, you guys take off without me.
Maybe I can distract security.

I am a magician, after all.

What?
We got to get him to the truck.

Uh, no, no, no,
they'll grab him.

We're not taking the truck.

[triumphant music playing]

[panting]
[bleating]



Whoa!

Oh, come on! Get my car!

Let's go!
[bleating]


Head to the park.
I'll meet you there.

[Chief Watkins]
We need backup, now!

Come on, boy!


[men grunting]

Hey. What are you doing?

You like magic?

[laughs] Watch me disappear!
Hey! Get back!

We're here at Lyfegro...
Can I borrow this?

Hey!
That dog was stolen by Lyfegro.

[Clifford panting]

[sirens wailing]


[Emily panting]


Come on! Go!

[helicopter reporter]
<i>It looks like the big red dog</i>

<i>has escaped
the Lyfegro facility</i>

<i>in the strangest chase
I have ever seen.</i>

Come on, come on! Yeah!


I see red.


Come on!

[Emily] Go, go!
[police siren chirps]

He belongs to my niece, Emily.

She rescued him
when he was just a tiny puppy.

If her mom is watching,

I'd like it on record
that I told her not to.

Casey?
<i>But she didn't listen.</i>

<i>Because she knew,
right from the beginning,</i>

that that dog

was her dog.

<i>And now, a big corporation</i>

<i>is trying to steal a puppy
from a little girl.</i>

Are we gonna do
anything about it?

And finally, to my ninth-grade
math teacher, Mr. Beamus,

who told me that I would
never amount to anything,

<i>I would like to point out</i>

<i>that only one of us
is on TV right now.</i>

<i>So, Mr. Beamus,
you can kiss my...</i>

Oh, snap.

<i>Sir, where is that dog going?</i>

<i>Manhattan Bridge Park.</i>

Can we go faster?

[woman] Over here.
I'm gonna need a ride.

That dog right there!

the park should be really close.

[Mr. Jarvis] Just step on it.
I'm stepping! I'm stepping!

Guys! Emily! She's on TV!
What?

Careful!
Two hands on the wheel!

Everybody calm down!
Okay, okay, okay!

[police sirens blaring]


[patrol cop] Sarge,
big red dog heading north!

[triumphant music playing]


[both] Yes!
[helicopter reporter] <i>We have police security vehicles</i>

<i>all chasing after</i>

a young girl riding
a giant red dog.

[Clifford panting]


[Emily chuckles]
[police sirens blaring]

Come on, boy, faster!

[siren wails]
I mean, this is crazy!

Doesn't she understand
she can't win? Come on.

[dramatic music playing]

[Clifford panting]
[vehicles honking]

Oh, no!

[siren wailing]


[Emily grunting]

Come on, jump!



Oh, perfect.
[man] Wow.

[Emily chuckles]

[Emily] Yes! We made it!
[kid 1] Look at that dog!

[kid 2] Look at the dog.

[indistinct chatter]

[people exclaiming]


Mr. Bridwell!

My goodness!

Someone's been eating
their spinach. [laughs]

You are hot! You need a drink.

Go over there to that big blue
dunk tank over there.

[Emily] Mr. Bridwell!
Emily!

[siren wails]

We were looking for you,
and we thought you were dead.

Well, I hope not.
I just booked a safari.

But at the hospital,
we saw your bow tie.

Oh, I understand.

Well, I went there to spend
time with an old friend.

A very sick old friend.

And he'd always
loved that bow tie,

so I gave it to him

so that he could stand out
from the crowd up there.

[sirens blaring]

Mr. Bridwell, you have to make Clifford
small again or they're gonna hurt him.

Small? But it was your love
that made him so big.

Nobody can take that away.

But will he be okay?

Your love is all he needs.

[Chief Watkins]
Create a perimeter!

Do not let that dog
leave this park.

[over PA] Emily
Elizabeth Howard,

for your own safety,

please step away
from the animal.

He's dangerous.
He's just a puppy!

That creature is the property
of Lyfegro

and is a threat to our city!

No, he's not!
He never hurt anyone, I swear.

[man] Lock him in a cage.
[barks]

Whoa, you see that?
He's violent!

[Emily] No, he's just scared.
[Clifford whines]

You would be, too.
Please, leave him alone.

Mr. Bridwell,
you've got to do something.

I can't do this on my own.
They're not listening!

Really?
Well, why have they come?


And you thought you didn't
have any friends, huh?

[Chief Watkins] All right, ladies
and gentlemen, disperse immediately.

Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

See what happens
when people break the rules?

Emily, if you want them
to listen,

you'd better speak.

Hmm?

Let's go get that dog.
No, please, stop!

No, I have something
I have to say.

[Clifford whimpers]

There's a lot
of people here.

You got this.

My name is Emily Elizabeth,

and this is my dog, Clifford.

I know he's bigger
than most dogs,

but he's also the kindest,

most loving dog
in the whole wide world.

[man] He's a freak!
[people clamoring]

It's dangerous!
No, he's not dangerous! He's just different.

That's all.
[Clifford whines]

I know how he feels,

because I know
what it's like to not fit in.

Just because you're different,

it doesn't mean that it's okay
to be teased or bullied.

And I'm gonna guess that many
of you know how much that hurts.


[uplifting music playing]

Someone once told me

it's the people
who are unique,

they're the ones
who change the world.

If Clifford was just a regular
dog, we wouldn't all be here.

We've got to stand up for him!

Emily's right!
Yeah, that's right!

That dog saved my life!

[yips]
[Emily] He doesn't hurt anyone.

He just...
He loves.


And if we can
love each other like this,

none of us would have to feel
small and all alone again.

Right, Clifford?
[yips]

It's not right
to take him away

just because he's big and red.

So, please.
Please let me keep my dog.

[people cheering]

Who's with me?

[cheering]
[uplifting music rises]



Bravo!

Bravo! Bravo!
[growls]

That was so inspiring, Emily.

I've got chills.


Man, I hate to ruin
this beautiful moment,

but I've got to reclaim
my property.

Because we all know this dog
you call Clifford

belongs to...
[clicks tongue] Lyfegro.

[crowd protests]
No, he doesn't.

Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
Please do not take my word for it.

You see, he was microchipped
at birth.

[crowd groans]
Yeah.

[whines softly]

Officer, could you
please do the honors?

[Raul] Go home!
He converted her property!

[Albert] It's in his left neck.
That's right, left neck.

Oh, my gosh, this is glorious.

Excuse me, young lady.

[dramatic music playing]


[beeping]
[sighs]

[beeping rapidly]
[Tieran chuckles]

This dog belongs to...
Yeah.

...Emily Elizabeth Howard.

[Clifford barks]
[cheering]

[triumphant music playing]

What? That's impossible.

Good for you, Emily!
That's bonkers!

This is a mistake. Nah-ah. It's a mistake!
It's got to be a mistake.

[Chief Watkins] We need to have a talk about
the bill the city will be sending you.

Please escort this gentleman
to my vehicle.


Come on.
Colette, where's my attorney?

I quit.
What? Colette!

I'll never leave you, sir.

I don't care about you.
Colette!

Ouch.
Colette, come back here.

Isn't technology amazing?

People say
it's quite like magic.

[laughs]
So, if you'll excuse me,

I have some other people
I need to help.

After all, you're not
the only person in the world

who isn't looking for a pet.


[Bridwell whistling]

[Chief Watkins] Officers!

Stand down!
[crowd cheering]

[Clifford barks]
[man] Make way!

Come here, Clifford!
Way to go!

Come, come.

[Maggie] Hey, girl.
Mom!

My bold and brave little girl.

Just like you taught me.

Oh, by the way, Mom...
we got a dog.

Yeah, I noticed.

As for you,
I have no words to...

"I love you. I forgive you.

You are
the responsible brother

that I always dreamed
of having."

Okay, we'll go with that
for now.

Well, you did it, Em.

You saved him,
just like you said you would.

Well, I couldn't have done it without
my mature and super-dependable uncle.

You have another uncle?

You know how you said
no one believes in you?

I believe in you.

You just need to believe
in yourself.

How do you know so much stuff for a fourth grader?
Sixth.

I was doing air quotes
behind your back.

[Clifford whines]
Okay.


We love you, too, Clifford.


Let's take a picture
of Clifford.

A group photo.

Everybody scooch in.
Get in, get in.

Uh, Casey, you know what?
Casey, just get on the dog.

No. No!
Yeah, yeah, that'd be neat.

Get on the dog, it's fun!
I'm not getting on the dog.

If you don't get on the dog,
I'll tell Mom about...

Okay, let's get on the dog.

[indistinct chatter]

[Mr. Jarvis] There he goes.
Yeah, get up there.

Come on, Casey.

Get up there.

[Casey grunts]
[crowd exclaiming]

There you go.
[Casey grunts]

That's perfect. Perfect.

[upbeat pop music playing]
Oh, no.


[Emily] Clifford. No fetch.
Oh, no.

No fetch!
No. [screams]

Clifford! [screaming]




<i>simple love
between a girl and her dog</i>

<i>changed everything.</i>

<i>Emily and her mother
were welcomed home,</i>

<i>and Packard even acquired
a uniquely helpful assistant.</i>

<i>Other people matured.</i>

<i>And by "other people",
I mean Uncle Casey,</i>

moved out of his van</i>
