Good morning, Doctor.

I'm not afraid anymore.

I'm good.

It worked.

I feel so much better
than even yesterday.

Sleeping better and
feeling a lot better.

It will be great to join
up with my family again.

Next week's my daughter's birthday.

It would be quite a great homecoming.

I just want to say, Dr. Greiss,
that I'm feeling a lot better

today than I was yesterday,
and yesterday I was feeling

better than before that and
tomorrow I'm gonna feel better.

Doctor, please! You already helped me,
Dr. Greiss, I'm fine!

(ANNOUNCER-1 V.O.)
Multiple sources reporting

that a fire has broken out
at Eloise causing significant...

(ANNOUNCER-2 V.O.)
Witnesses reported seeing

smoke and hearing screams
a little after 10:00 o'clock

last night as firefighters
rushed to the scene...

(ANNOUNCER-1 V.O.)
Reportedly broke out

just after 10:00 PM last night.

The cause of the fire is not
yet known but investigators

believe it was intentional...

(ANNOUNCERS V.O.)
Multiple casualties, among them,

Dr. H. H. Greiss,

Chief physician at Eloise
known for his controversial

and brutal therapies.

(ANNOUNCER-1 V.O.)
And vicious medical experiments.

It's also believed that
many patients perished

in the fire as well...

(ANNOUNCER-2 V.O.)
Firefighters rushed

to the scene but were too late
for many patients and staff

who were trapped on
the upper floors of Eloise

and are believed to have
died in the blaze.

(NARRATOR V.O.)
In the years since its closing

in 1982 after the fire.

Countless locals have explored
the vacant buildings

of Eloise and reported
chilling tales of hearing voices

or screams and in some cases,
seeing apparitions

or even ghosts
of deceased patients and staff

roaming the asylum's empty,
decrepit corridors,

prisoners still.

One former patient was reported

as saying,
"People tried to escape all the time."

"But once you're committed
into Eloise, you can't leave."

"You can never leave."

( SCREAMS )

( BABY CRIES )

( DOOR CLOSES )

Hello, Pia.

My name is Detective Frazer.

I'd like to ask you a couple
questions, if you don't mind.

Some kids found the body of
this man at Eloise two days ago.

In your statement, you had
mentioned a Dell Richards.

Is that him?

( GUN FIRES )

After we discovered the body,
we decided to scour

the building and look
for your brother, Scott.

And uh, Jacob Martin, prior statement.

We did find your brother's remains.

The gas explosion was so intense
that only dental records

were able to make the positive ID.

But we can't find Jacob Martin.

During the course of my investigation,

I've come across some things that are
very strange, and I'm hoping that

you can help me wrap
my mind around them.

This is an old case file
from a patient at Eloise.

In it is Jacob Martin's
birth certificate and these.

Can you explain these, Pia?

Pia?

Pia?

( HARD ROCK MUSIC )

All right, try again now.

( ENGINE REVS )

Yeah, that's the sound.

Should be good, buddy.

Jacob, you got a call inside.

Yeah, Jacob here.

(DAVIES OVER PHONE)
Jacob, finally, I've been trying

to reach you for a week.

It's Arlen Davies, your father's lawyer.

Yeah, well, I haven't spoken
to my father in years.

(DAVIES OVER PHONE)
I see, well,

I hate to be the one to tell you

but your father has passed.

Wait, what?

(DAVIES OVER PHONE)
I realize this must be a shock.

Since you are his only surviving heir,

there are important details
that need to be discussed

concerning the estate.

The funeral's tomorrow
at Elwood Cemetery, 2:00 PM.

Yeah.

(DAVIES OVER PHONE)
Perhaps we can talk afterward.

Yeah, okay.
I'm sorry for your loss.

I'll be there.

Who was that?

Oh, nobody.

You all right?

Yeah... I'm fine.

I just gotta go up
to Detroit for a few days.

Why?

My dad died.

( ROCK MUSIC FADES UP )

you weren't able to make it

to the funeral.

It was a lovely service.

I realize this must be a very
emotional time for you.

We haven't really spoken since he

sent me to Juvie when I was 16.

Well, it was the court
that sent you to Juvie.

I don't need to be rude, Mr. Davies,

but if you please,
just get down to bussiness here.

In the last two days,

I'm afraid a small
complication has arisen.

There's no more money, is there?

No, there's money all right.

And with no siblings and no
mother, it all falls to you.

And then there is an account in
the amount of $1.2 million.

That's before taxes of course.

Turn of the last century
your people were pretty big

into real estate.

What's the problem exactly?

His sister, your aunt.
Genevieve Martin.

What aunt?

She was committed to Eloise
Insane Asylum in the late 1960s.

A decade or so later it closed,
but she was never released.

Most probable reason, of course,
is that she died there.

So, you are still the sole inheritor

with proof of her death.

If we have to have her declared dead,

you won't see a dime for seven years.

So, where do I find proof?

Well, as a happened. Eloise still
has a small administrative office.

I suggest that you stop
by there tomorrow.

As a relative, you can request
the records.

Thank you.

There's something you should know.

Your father had cancer
the last three years.

But, it wasn't the cancer
that killed him.

When things got really bad,
he decided to take his own life.

With a straight razor.

I didn't know.

( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING )

( SIGHS )

( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )

( DOG BARKING )

( WATCH TICKING )

When things got really bad,

he decided to take his own life.

( EERIE MUSIC FADES UP )

Holy shit!

What the fuck are you doing
with that razor?

You scared the shit out of me.

What the fuck are you
doing in a ski mask?

Look, I saw the lights on,
took a chance.

Look, I was fucking with you, okay?

Did you hear about my old man?

Yeah, I'm sorry.

Don't be.
Yo, man.

Oh, you scared of a little
straight razor?

Come on!

( LAUGHING )

What's up, man, how you doing?

I'm good, man.

Yeah, I can see, you're like
the GQ of delinquency.

Thugs can have style, too...
thugs can have style.

( MUSIC PLAYING )

What can I get ya'?

I will have a Last Word.

Wait, if you don't know how to make it,

I mean, I can show you.

I'm a pretty good bartender myself.

Beer is good, too.

Uh... just two Atwaters, please.

I'm gonna need to see some ID.

Really? I'm like 30.

Awe, just a baby.

Sit anywhere, I'll find you.

It's a tradition around here.

The birthday boy buys everyone a round.

Oh shit.

Yeah!

Really? That's a great tradition.

( CROWD CHEERING )

Happy birthday. Man, I didn't
know it was your birthday.

It's not, it's tomorrow.

Anyway, what's up with
you, man? How's work?

I've been straight for like,
what? Two years now.

You've been straight for two
years? Running around with

a ski mask on, huh?

I got smarter, you know,
I no longer wear them

in bars, you know?

You evolved, that's nice, man.

But you right, I'm still running it.

You know...

Got something hanging
over my head right now.

Like what, some money shit?

Come on, man, it's always a money thing.

How much?

20 G's.

20 G's? Holy fuck, man,
what were you doing?

Fuck, I'm in some deep shit, man.

Well, look, I might be coming
into some money.

Might be able to help you out.

What, 20 G's worth?

Yeah... more like 1.2 mil.

Bullshit.
No bullshit.

You just got 1.2 laying
around the house?

Fucking love my white friends.
Are you serious?

At least that's what I'm hearing
from my father's lawyer anyway.

So, how do you get it?

I have to get this death
certificate for some aunt...

I didn't know I had.

Her name's Genevieve.
Here take a look.

She was locked away in that
mental hospital, Eloise,

right outside Detroit, you know?

Yeah, yeah, that place closed
down like, what, 30 years ago?

It burned down, right?

That's what I thought, man,
but there's still a couple

old buildings there,
just a bunch of files.

All I have do is swing
by there tomorrow, pick it up,

piece of cake.

Yo, I'm happy you're home.
Oh my God!

Yeah, I bet you are.
Bet you are.

All right.

Here you go.

She's beautiful.

That's my aunt.

She looks familiar.

[BAR PATRON]
Pia, some shots!

Pia? That's a pretty name.

Hey, what time you got?

Awe, come on, man, you know
I don't carry a watch.

Oh, you don't carry a watch
on you like the one you just

pulled from my father's house?

You profiling motherfucker.

What, you want it back?

Nah... all good, man.
That's you.

Thanks, Anton.

So, when do you get off?

Jacob... good luck finding
that "Last Word" around here.

Happy birthday, Jacob.

Yo, it's good to see you're
still a closer, man.

Fuck off!

( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )

Hi, I'm looking for
administrator office.

Hi.... I'm the one who called
about my aunt's records.

Of course, Martin.
Come right in.

Thank you. Right here?

Yes.
Okay.

Please have a seat, I'll go find them.

Thank you.

I noticed that painting outside.
What's the deal with that?

Oh, that's actually young Eloise.

They nicknamed the asylum
after her, when she was a child.

Lucky kid.

Mm... About 7,000 former
residents were officially

buried in the cemetery but
the real number is actually

ten times higher.

This was not very easy to find,
believe me.

But, here you are.

I appreciate it, thank you so much.

You're welcome.

Bye.
Bye, bye.

( RINGS BELL )

Uh, yeah, it just says here
that it's been remitted

to the Annex, per Dr. H. H. Greiss.

Oh yes. The Annex is where we
keep all our nonpublic records.

Sealed even to me.
You'll need a court order.

Ah... and uh...
How long will that take?

We could put in the request right now,

we'd hear back in six or seven months...
Hopefully.

Um... yeah, is there any way we
could maybe just, you know,

bend the rules a little bit
on this just once?

Oh no. No, no, no.

But here's what I can do.

Fill this out for you.

J... A...

Oh, Jesus.

Shit.

Dammit.

What the fuck?

Oh, my God.

Oh, man... Jesus.

Holy shit!

Awe, you scared me, man!
Are you okay?

I'm sorry I just, uh... hit your
cart here.

Are you good?

It should be okay.

I didn't bend the wheels or anything.

So... it's all here.

Uh...

I'm gonna get going if you're good.

Um, you know...
no harm, no foul.

Okay, I'm going.

Oh, fuck.

Big day, man. Big day.

Okay, I think we celebrate,
which is good news.

Great fucking news.

Did you get the certificate?

I hate this place, man.
So fucking depressing.

Did you get the certificate?
No, I didn't get it.

Found out the file, has been
moved to some other place

on property in Chita.
Court order to get to.

Fucking Annex shit someone tagged.

How long this will take?
6 to 8 months.

Shit!
Yeah, so...

and see what happens.

we wait for the courts,

you'll never get a dime, right?

You want that?

Can you imagine what we can
do with that money?

Yo, we could start our lives over.

Shit, we could start them.

We have been through some
crazy shit, huh?

That's the Jacob I know.
That's the Jacob I know.

Any security in there?

No, not really, to be honest.

So, what are we waiting on?

Look, people break in that
place all the time just for fun.

Yeah but how are we gonna find
the fucking Annex of all places?

Man, you call me crazy.
I've been doing some research.

Check this out.

Wow.

Scott Carter... this guy's got
blueprints and everything.

We get in, get the file
and get the fuck out.

Yeah... let's do it.

Yo, he lives on Schaefer.
That's right up the street.

Well, dude, let's get
over there, come on.

What are you waiting for?
Call him on the way.

Oh, so now I'm your secretary.

( KNOCKING ON DOOR )

( DOORKNOB RATTLING )

Yo, Scott!

Get the lights to on!

Yo, Scott!?

Scott?

What the fuck is all this weird shit?

Holy shit.

Scott!

This is ain't right here.

He was expecting us though, right?

Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

You know, maybe this wasn't
a good idea after all.

Yo... Jake?

Look at this.

Whoa!
Shit!

Really?

( GIGGLING )
Jesus.

What up, man?

So you ain't wearin' no pants.

Jeez. You steal all this stuff?

No... I collected it.

That's a good one, I should
use that one, collected.

You can use anything you want
as long as you return it.

This is Dr. Greiss,
known for his famous

confrontational therapy.

Yes, yes! Oh, do you want
to see my favorite thing?

Doctor, your critics have been
extremely vocal

about this radical, what do you call it?

Confrontational Therapy.
Some liken it to torture.

What do you say about that?

I've heard it all before.

What they fail to realize

is that we need to confront our fears.

Conquer them, not coddle them.

Our deepest fears, the ones that
terrify us the most,

cannot be alleviated by locking
people up and drugging them

into catatonia.
It's our moral imperative

to get to the root of these fears
and destroy them.

Confrontational therapy does this.

Yes, there are side effects,
but there are side effects

with chemotherapy and surgery.

We submit our patients

to their phobic triggers
in a safe environment.

Reprogramming them, so to speak.

Eloise was the biggest asylum
in the world at one time.

It had its own zip code, farm,
fire department, train station.

The first X-ray machine
was developed here,

tested on patients.

Not you, Emma...

Oh, oh, oh, do you want to
hear about the lobotomy craze?

Yo, man, he's touching me.

Stop.
Maybe not.

( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )

Hey, man, come on, man, cut
the camera off, dude. Cut the camera!

Look, I took out the IR filter,
so it only shoots infrared.

I've been dying to try this out!

I'm hoping to capture some
ghosts with it.

I just recorded three seconds,
one for each of us.

Good. Three seconds.

Beautiful, buddy.

Hey, Scott. I have
a proposition for you.

How would you like to use your
camera here tonight?

Uh... listen, I need to collect
some papers...

Documents.

Documents... on my aunt,
and they're locked away

in a top secret location...

Annex.
What?

The Annex.
Yes.

The Annex, it's on
the 5th floor of the Annex.

Yeah, let's go!

The Annex, the Annex,
it's on the 5th floor,

I need to get permission first.

No! He's gotta get
permission first.

But she's running away.

Yes, you go in through here,

then down this corridor,
up the back stairs.

The administration building
is locked tight,

but you can get in
through the power station.

They never lock it.

Oh, oh, this will be great!

This will be, an adventure!
And he's touching me.

[WOMAN'S VOICE]
Hey, Scotty, can you help me

with the groceries, please?

There's just a few more bags in the car!

Who's that?
I don't know.

Who's that?
I'll be back.

Keep walking back slow.
Look at this.

No, no, no, hell no, man.

I know what you're thinking.

I am not going to Eloise,

with a crazy dude, jumping on
the bed like he's Daffy Duck.

You know what, I'm done, dude.

Look, he obviously knows all
of this shit like the back

of his hand, we're golden.

Rain Man's on me.

Yeah, you babysit him.

Okay.

This is them.

This is Dell. This is...
I don't know his name.

What the hell are you doing here?

I was just gonna ask you
the same question.

I live here, he's my bro and
you've got 15 seconds

before I call 911.

Whoa, whoa.
I have friends!

How did you meet them, sweetie?

No, no, we found him,
we found him, all right?

We just want to take a tour of Eloise,

and Scott's the best person...

How did you meet?

[DELL] We met him on his site.
Yeah.

He's got a hot, little site @eloise.

We looked him up, right?

We found the site, his picture's
on there, all the information.

It's great.

Okay, well then,
tomorrow we can call the staff

and get back to you guys.

No, no, I was gonna use my new camera!

He wants to use his new camera.

I just said that.

I need to talk to you
outside for a minute.

Okay.

Scotty, you stay with Dill.

Jacob, no. Don't leave me...

Okay, just let me start
from the beginning, all right?

My father just passed away, okay?

Hey, man, Jacob, man, come on, man,
y'all playing games.

I wanna touch you.

No, not with no pants on.
Get your pants on.

And I know it's asking a lot,
but no one knows

that place better than your brother.


I know, and he's all I've got
and I won't

have him taken advantage of.

He is obsessed with that place

and if he wanders off
or something happens...

Quick in, quick out.
I'll watch him, I promise.

You'll watch him?

Yeah.
In Eloise?

I think you're gonna have your
hands full keeping up with him.

Put your head here.
Yo, man.

Put it there. Put it on!

Now that you got him all riled up,

it's impossible to say no to him.

Okay, quick in, quick out,
and I'm coming.

Yes! Thank you.

Hey... Pia's in.

You guys wanna see something funny?

Scott, don't!
( CHUCKLING ) No.

Don't!

No, this will be fun,
this will be an adventure.

Yeah, yeah...

It's all good.
...it's gonna be something.

Don't look too happy about it.

It's gonna be a disaster,
that's what it's gonna be.

This is ridiculous.

Pants!

Do you need like a bag or...

Bag!

Has anyone ever died during
this therapy, Doctor?

Medicine is not an exact science.

Why is he so fascinated with this place?

Careful, careful, man, careful!

Our mom used to be a nurse here.

She left for work one day
when I was about four,

so Scotty was six.

She just never came home.

Never heard from her again, either.

Sometimes I think Scott still thinks

she's in here for something.

So, you know where we are?
Yes... I have a map.

You got a map. So, what used
to be here, anyways?

It's always been this, it's a cemetery.

Potter's Field, it's where they
buried the patients.

The patients? You mean all this
time we walking

on crazy dead people?

Of course they're crazy,
it's a mental institution.

Our dad went a little nuts
with Scotty needing

special attention and all,
so it was pretty much

up to me to look out for him
once we realized

she was never coming back.

That's gotta be pretty tough
for a four-year-old.

Yeah, but... that's life
I guess.

So, what was it like living
without a mom?

You have no idea.

Actually I do.

I barely even remember her.

When she left I was probably
a little angry,

so I tried to just forget all about her.

What about you?

Never really met her,
so I don't know what I missed.

My father, he would never even
speak about her.

He didn't really get along too well.

Hey, y'all know we're walking
on crazy dead people, right?

Oh, okay, okay, y'all in love, okay.

( THUNDER ROLLING )

Okay, we're gonna go in through
here and from here,

we're gonna go through the power
station and from there

we're gonna go to the
administration building.

Hey buddy, is there uh...

Is there any other way into this
situation besides... this?

No.

Okay.

"Any other way into this situation?"

How you holding up, Jacob?

Okay.

Oh, God.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm just a little claustrophobic.

You know, no big deal.

Everybody's afraid of something.
I don't do needles.

I wouldn't say afraid necessarily...

just, you know... a little
uncomfortable.

[PIA] Okay.
That's bullshit. Bullshit.

I wasn't talking to you,
dipshit... fuck.

All right.
It's okay.

Here we go.

Oh shit.

( LOUD CLANG )

Yo, what was that?

That's the building settling.

This area's famous for its sinkholes.

What, are you scared?

Man, hell no, I ain't scared.

Ah, bullshit.

Yeah, bullshit, don't tell
me that didn't scare

the piss out of you just a little bit.

Look at that, what's that on your pants?

That's rain, dipshit.

That's some pissy-ass rain.

A minute ago, you was crying
about being claustrophobic.

This place gives me the creeps.

Thank you. Finally somebody
can admit that this place

gives them the creeps.

This is my favorite part.
Down here are the catacombs.

This is where they used to store
the dead bodies

when winter hit because it
was too cold to bury them.

Enough with the dead bodies, man.

Come on.

Okay, these are stairs.
We have to go up 43 more.

Scott, easy.

Yo, what's that?

The lights are on a motion
sensor. Du'h, Dell, du'h!

That ain't funny.

Wait, wait, stop, stop!

That's her... that's Eloise.

So, where the hell are we?

Okay, we're here now...

Do you remember?

Mom... Mom used to take you
to work sometimes,

do you remember?

Not really.

No, no, do you remember mom used
to take you to work sometimes?

No.

Annex is on the 5th floor
of the next building.

You go through these stairs.

It's not in this building?

No, that's why they call it the Annex!

It has very restricted access.

( TAPPING ON WINDOW )

Flashlights! Flashlights!

( WHIMPERING )

Shh!

Hold on, I think I hear something.

(MAN OVER RADIO)
All right, I'm pulling around.

We can check back
after dinner, I'm starving.

Copy that.

Yo, man, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

Shh!
That was scary.

Okay, they're gone. Hey, let's
go before they come back.

Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go.

It has very restricted access.

Why is it restricted?
What else is in the Annex?

The nursery, you asked what else
was in the Annex, the nursery.

Isn't this fun?
No.

This is the Annex.

I've never come this far.

Dr. Greiss.

Mom.

Maybe Mom's picture will be here.

Pia, maybe Mom's picture's here!

Where's mom's picture, Pia?

I don't know, bud.

Pia, where's mom?

Mom?

Mommy?

Mom?

Anybody know where we're going?

Where are we going?

There should be a hallway up here.

Yes, this way, this way!

These are people's ashes.

Families just left them here?
Yeah.

Scotty, don't touch!
Whoa, whoa!

Unh-unh.
No, come on.

Nah, man.

Why?

Come on.
Don't touch.

Let's go.
Come one, let's go.

It's okay.

Where we at?

Should be a little...

This is it, I knew it, this is
the records room right up here!

All right, watch out, on our
grand adventure.

What's up with these dead birds?
Aw, shit.

Fuck that.

These are dead birds!

Hey, wait up!

Shit, how many rooms are there?

Yo, look at this.

Agh!

( GIGGLING )
Scotty, it's okay. Come on.

Aw, shit.
Come on.

Oh, my God.

So they just said, fuck cleaning up.

Holy shit.

Right?

Scotty, stay close.

can't find that shit.

are we supposed to find

a certificate in a place like this, man?

Yo, I'm gonna go into
another record room.

Hi, pigeon!

Don't touch, buddy.
Okay.

What's your aunt's name again?

Genevieve... Genevieve Martin.

That's me.

Agh!

( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )

What the hell...

What's happening? Who are you?
What's happening?

Hello?

Jesus, Greiss is one
sadistic motherfucker.

Any luck?

( SIGHS )

Not really. Found the M's.
Find Scott?

No, I can't find him.
I'm starting to worry.

He's probably having a ball.
Right?

Yeah.

Look, I just found the M's,
so... I'm really close.

Shouldn't be too long.

I can help you.

Catherine...

Whoa, whoa, whoa, I got it,
I got it! Yes!

What?

Genevieve Martin! Yes!

Dell, Scotty, we found it.

Fantastic!

( THUNDER CRASHING )

( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING )

Died here.

Hold on.

So she died May 5th.

Yeah, that was 30 years ago to the day.

Wow.

Doesn't say... doesn't say
how she died?

Yeah, well...

Round up the troops
and go celebrate, huh?

Hey... I couldn't have done this
without you and Scott.

We'll find him.

( WATCH TICKING )

My watch... what the hell?

What the fuck?

Agh!

Oh shit. What do we have here?

Gotta love Codeine.

Fuckin' shit, man.

Y'all must be stoked.
Where's Scott?

We got it!

Is it hot in here?

Let's get the fuck out of here.

Scotty, we got what we need,
please respond.

Will one of you guys try him
because he's just

not listening to me.

Yeah, I got him.

Yo, Scott, get your crazy
ass here, man, we found it.

Hey...

You okay?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

Are you sure? You look a little crazy.

Put that bag down.

You put the fucking bag down.
Shut the fuck up.

Brother, hey, look at me.
No one's there. No one's there.

You're telling me you don't see him?

He keeps telling me to put the bag down.

Hey, hey, brother, no one's there.
Look at me, it's just us!

No, you see him, he's right
behind you, keep looking at me.

Relax.

Dude, you keep looking
at me like that, dude.

Dell, we've all been seeing
crazy things, it's not real.

We got the certificate,
we got the money.

Snap out of it, we got the certificate.

Stop fucking looking at me!

Whoa, what the fuck, man!
Dell, stop it!

Hey, put the gun down!
Jacob, do something!

Dell? Look at me, look at me.
What happened to your hand, man?

What about it?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, look at me, it's okay.

Yeah, yeah, it's Jacob, it's just me.

Why's my hand bleeding.
Just relax, it's okay.

You did this?

I did not do anything. It's just us.
Look at me, trust me.

It's just... look at me, it's
just me, it's Jacob.

Okay.
All right?

Jacob, watch out he's right...
( GUNSHOT )

Dell! Jacob, do something!

Dell! Dell!

Dell!
Hey, Dell!

Wait, where are we?

Get away from me!

No, those are my glasses, I need those.
No, not my cross!

Oh, no, my glasses!

Gentlemen, prepare for a transorbital.

No, I don't want a transorbital.
Get off me! Get away from me!

Nurse, neutroplast.

Get away from me! No!

This is a mistake!

No mistake. Strap him down, please.

( SCREAMING AND CRYING )

Dell!
Scott?

Scott?

( WHIMPERING )

Anesthesia, Doctor?

Not necessary.

If you don't remember pain,
then you never really felt it.

Just calm down. In a few
minutes, you'll be a new man,

and you won't remember a thing.

( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP )

Dr. Jones, hold that eyelid open.

( WHIMPERING )

Hammer.

( SCREAMING )

( SCREAMING )
Scotty!



Shit.

No, no, no! Scotty!

Go, go.
You lead the way out.

( GUN SHOT )
( GAS HISSING )

Agh! Agh!

Agh! Agh!

( GUN CLICKS )

Agh! Open the door!

( RUMBLING )

( GURGLING )

Go down.

Scotty!

Okay, he should be down here.

What did you say you were seeing?

A little girl. She was trying
to show me a box or something.

Inside the nursery...
Then she just vanished.

You think I'm nuts.

No... yeah... well, maybe.

The hole should be here.

I mean... it went down some
floors, it was pretty deep.

Maybe I got turned around.
Are you hearing music?

Yeah.

( DISTANT MUSIC PLAYING )

Scotty?

( MAN SINGING IN DISTANCE )

You're hearing that, right?

( SINGING CONTINUES )

â™ª Looks like it's all
just falling on down â™ª

â™ª Oh but it's got soul â™ª

â™ª I'm in a hole â™ª

â™ª Maybe we're all
just getting old â™ª

â™ª There's no place
here that I belong â™ª

â™ª I thought I'd be lucky
Man it's all wrong â™ª

â™ª So I motored back
to Newtown â™ª

â™ª Well it feels right â™ª

â™ª I motored back to Newtown
on a Saturday night â™ª

â™ª Oh I motor back to Motown
back to where I belong â™ª

( MUSIC STOPS )

( DOOR CREAKING )

Scotty, no! Scotty, no!
Scotty, why!

Baby, no!

No, Scotty! Why? My God, no!

What'd you do?

What the fuck did you do?

Fucking answer me!

Get the fuck off me!

As you can see, medicine
is not an exact science.

But now it's time for your treatment.

Come on, let's go!

Go, go!
Let's go!

Hey!

Jacob!

Go!

Hey, hey, stop please!

Hey, hey!

We need help!
Please, please!

Somebody just attack my friend inside.
Please, we need help!

Hold on, hold on.

Please, we need help,
somebody will get hurt, hurry.

Please stay here!
I'll be right back, stay here.

Hey, thank God. Hey.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, this is some mistake.

Where are the other officer?

No other officer.
No!

What are you talking about?

There's other officer,
go through that door.

No! No, no, no. This is a mistake.
Listen to me, please!

The rain just stop.

The building is a cloak.
Everything's changed.

When were you came outside.

Wait, wait, wait, I get it now.
Making it all change back to the past?

Is that what you says?
Just sit there and shut up!

take your seats.

Quiet down.

We have two interesting
case studies today.

This patient suffers from an
acute form of claustrophobia.

The most severe and frightening
of which is specifically...

the fear of waking up and discovering...

that you're buried alive.

So, when his anesthesia wears off,

he'll find himself in a morgue drawer.

Forcing him to face his ultimate fear.

Perhaps you're wondering
why he's gagged.

Well, when he comes to,

we wouldn't want him to wake the dead.

( LAUGHTER )

John, take him away, please.

Now, this is a most interesting case.

There are several names for it.
Aichmophobia is one.

Anyone?

Tryp... Trypanophobia.

Excellent. A deathly fear of injections.

A fear so strong the patient
would rather suffer...

the illness than to allow its cure.

This phobia has plagued us
doctors for many years.

You'll notice that
the patient is gagged.

What is most important to remember is,

is we must not lose our resolve.

No matter how we feel for the
patient, we have to remember

that we're helping them,
not hurting them.

Nurse Fletcher will take over?

As I have
a very special birth to perform.

( MUFFLED SCREAMS )

You're okay.

( BREATHING HEAVILY )

Come on.

Thank you, Officer.

Cover up and just try
to blend in, Jacob.

( INDISTINCT CHATTER )

East corridor...

Where would they take them?
Look at the name.

( SCREAMING )

( SCREAMING )

Oh, my God. She was...

She was pregnant.

On your birthday.

( SCREAMING )

No, no, it can't be.
It can't be.

( WHIMPERING )

Oh, my God.

Whoa, whoa, Jacob, you can't.
There's security everywhere.

( SCREAMS CONTINUE )

( BABY CRYING )

It's a boy.

Congrats, Doc.

Oh shit.

Don't.

I have to.
No, Jacob.

( SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING )

Hi.

It's Jacob.

It's me... it's Jacob.

Here, let's take this for the pain.

Here we go.

( WHIMPERING )

He's so beautiful.

Thought of a name?

Jacob.


That's a beautiful name.

Sorry, I can't hear you.

( WHISPERING )

Don't worry, Gen, this is one
child that won't grow up

in this God-forsaken place,
I don't care who his father is.

I'll call your brother right now.

( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING )

Where'd they go?
There.

( EERIE MUSIC FADES UP )

What... What the hell is she doing?

( BABY CRYING )

Pia, come here, sweetheart.

That was my doll.

Pia, Look... look at this baby.

I'm gonna cover him up
a little bit, okay?

That's my mother.

Thank you, sweetheart.

This is gonna be yours now.
You take good care of it.

There's a gentleman waiting
outside by a car, okay.

And I want you to give this box to him.

He's gonna take really
good care of him,

make sure he gets home safely, okay?

So, now go, Pia, and don't
stop for anybody. Okay?

Pia?

Go on... go.

Where's my son?

Where's my son?

Where's my son?!

Find that kid.

Immediate lockdown, seal all exits.

All right, let's go.

( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )

You wonder why I'm claustrophobic.

I spent my first
full fucking day in that thing.

What are you gonna do?

There was a fire on this day in 1980.

Now... now there's gonna
be a bigger one.

Unless I missed my guess,
my uncle... no, my father

is going to be pulling up
and you smuggle me

out in that box you've been carrying.

Okay.

Here, take this and stand back.

( MUSIC CONTINUES )

Go, go, go, stay back!

Here, go! Hit the fire alarm.

Come on!

( ALL YELLING )

Clear the hospital!
Clear the hospital! This way!

Let's clear the floors now!

everybody exit the building.

( ALL SHOUTING )

Wait, Jacob, look.

No, no! Jacob! No, Jacob!

No! No! You gotta go!
Jacob! No, let me go!

Somebody get him!
Somebody has to help him, please!

Why won't you listen to me!

Will somebody listen to me please.

He grabbed my friend.
Lady, listen, come with me!

This place has been closed down!
Come on.

There's a doctor in there!
Listen to me! No, no doctor!

Wait, no please, there's
a doctor. No, listen!

He killed my brother and my
mother. Please listen to me!

No doctors have been
in there for 30 years.

Blanket.

They tried to kill him!

( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING )

( MUSIC ENDS )

Pia?

Okay.

Okay.

Well, I thought you might
like to have these.

What really happened to Jacob Martin?

Get anywhere?

( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING )

(PIA V.O.)
He is obsessed with that place

and if he wanders off
or something happens...

(JACOB V.O.) Quick in, quick out.
I'll watch him, I promise.

(DELL V.O.)
Yo, Scott,

get your crazy ass here, man,
we found it.

(SCOTT V.O.) Do you remember?
Mom used to take you

to work sometimes. Do you remember?
Do you remember?

(JACOB V.O.)
Pia... that's a pretty name.

(PIA'S MOM V.O.)
Pia, you take good care of it,

make sure it gets home safely, okay?
