HOYLE:
I'm waiting for something.

It's an elevator.

Yeah, an elevator at a hotel.

One of those antique ones,
like you see in old movies.

I think I'm supposed to get on.

But-- I'm afraid.

PSYCHIATRIST:
What are you afraid of?

I don't know, I...

There's somebody here.

Somebody else is here.

I can't see her.
I think...

It's a woman.

She's telling me something.

PSYCHIATRIST:
Do you know this woman?

I think she's come back.

Back from some other time
to change things,

to stop me from ruining...

She wants to help me.

Help me have a second chance.
But I'm afraid.

PSYCHIATRIST:
Try to look at the woman.

I don't want to believe her,
but I'm afraid she's right, you know?

The wrong choices, mistakes.

PSYCHIATRIST:
Can you look at the woman?

Yes.

Yes.

PSYCHIATRIST:
Can you tell me who she is?

She's me.

<i>DUDAS (RADIO):
And that's what Jung said,</i>

<i>that the unconscious knows things.</i>

<i>It knows everything, really.</i>

<i>He called it "absolute knowledge,"
and it surfaces in dreams.</i>

<i>RADIO HOST:
And we can tap into it any time?</i>

<i>DUDAS (RADIO): Well, normally
the knowledge is overwhelmed</i>

<i>by our conscious mind.</i>

<i>It blinds us
to something far greater.</i>

[Phone rings]

<i>The tip of a secret
known only to certain people.</i>

[Turns off radio]

[Phone rings]

Hoyle.

Be right there.

You okay for this?

Keep those flashlights
away from me, will ya?

Get some boys in here
to cut through this bolt.


What do we got?

Green door.

First one on the right.

Damn!

TRENCH COAT MAN:
Over here.

Hoyle.

Poor bastard.

[Camera snaps picture]

Check for exits at the end.

You won't find any.

Excuse me?

There's no way out down there.

I... think I've been here before.

[Man whistles]

You find it?

Diplomatic papers.

This notebook you're looking for
must be pretty damn important.

It is.

What d'you got there?

T.S. Eliot, eh?

Never got into Eliot.
Can't understand a word of it.

It's just a book.

<i>* I don't need your photograph
to keep by my bed</i>

<i>* Your picture
is always in my head</i>

<i>* The very thought of you</i>

<i>* And I forget to do</i>

<i>* The little ordinary things</i>

<i>* That everyone ought to do</i>

<i>* I see your face in every flower</i>

<i>* Your eyes in stars above</i>

<i>* It's just the thought of you</i>

<i>* The very thought of you</i>

<i>* My love</i>

Subtitles: Arigon

Wait. Don't tell me.

Manhattan.

You're a regular fortune teller.

Classy drink for a classy gal.

Nice set.

I beg your pardon?

Your set, on stage.
Nice job.

I always wanted to be a singer
when I grow up.

What are you working on?

It's complicated.

You ever feel
like you hit a brick wall

and you're never
going to get through,

and you ought to know damn well
to let it go?

So I come in here and tip a few,

wake up with a migraine
tomorrow afternoon and try again.

Anyway, that's the crop.

I meant your drink,
what kind of drink you're working on.

But, hey, whatever you feel
like sharing.

BARTENDER:
Manhattan.

Mmm!

You know the secret
to a good Manhattan?

It's balance.

A lot of people are shy
with the vermouth.

Or they forget the bitters.

And you gotta have rye.

A bourbon Manhattan's
just not the same.

I don't mean that Canadian whiskey
they call "rye."

I mean the real stuff.

Yep. Balance.

Deep thoughts
for a girl who never drinks.

Only when I'm working.

I'll be damned.

Dudas!


Oh, hey. Sorry.

Share a cab?

-Did you catch up with Dudas?
-No.

I'm sorry. It's just...

I know. Rough day.

Kind of like Prufrock.

"Through certain
half-deserted streets."

It's T.S. Eliot.

-Have I...?
-This is me.

Oh.

Driver?

Don't worry about it.

Thanks.

I think he found something.

Dudas.

CAB DRIVER:
Ma'am, ain't you going to get out?

Sorry?

Didn't you want me to stop here?

Oh, no, I'm a little ways up.
This was her...

Never mind. Keep going.

<i>DUDAS (RADIO): It's the old allusion
of God's chess game.</i>

<i>Feynman called it that.</i>

<i>We can watch the game,
but we don't know the rules yet.</i>

<i>RADIO HOST: That's how
he described the universe.</i>

<i>DUDAS (RADIO):
Right, right.</i>

<i>And if you watch the game
long enough,</i>

<i>you can figure out how it's played.</i>

<i>That's the secret.</i>

[Cat meows]

No, you don't want any of that.

[Cat meows]

"Well, hello there.
I'm Schrödinger."

"Well, hello, Schrödinger!
How are you tonight?

I bounce up-and-down
when I talk for no apparent reason!"

Here. There you go.

[Water runs into bathtub]

[Computer chimes]

[Phone rings]

MACHINE:
Hoyle. Start singin'.


<i>HOYLE (ON PHONE):
Dammit!</i>

[Phone disconnects]


Dudas?

Dudas, wait!

HOYLE: Amazes me
what some people will drink.

No, thanks.

Thought you got lost.

Something like that.

TRENCH COAT MAN:
Here's all the dope I could dig up

on this lost lab notebook.

It's pretty sporadic. Everything keeps
coming back to that warehouse.

HOYLE:
Well, that's what we'd expect.

TRENCH COAT MAN:
Yeah, but it wasn't there.

HOYLE:
Not when we got there, it wasn't.

TRENCH COAT MAN: You're thinking
Dudas beat us to the punch.

HOYLE:
Hmm.

TRENCH COAT MAN: Found one lead
you might want to put the screws on.

Retired German research scientist.
Emeritus professor at the university.

Specialized in phantom energy,
quantum entanglement,

all that wise-head stuff you're into.

Surprise me.

This was decades ago.
Very secret research, unpublished.

That's impossible.

My boys got their ears to the ground.

They seem pretty confident
in this one.

And get this: Word is,
he skipped outta Berlin

during World War II
and high-tailed it over here.

Defector?

Just like your notebook's
anonymous writer.

You think he's our man?

Too young then.

But I'd lay odds he knew the guy.
Hell, he probably worked with him.

We need to find Dudas.
He knows something.

Fella's one hell of a sociopath.

Like he dropped off the face
of the earth.

Blew his research, lost his job.

Something God-awful
must have happened to him.

An art gallery?

Do me a favor.

Get me a ticket to this.

You got it.

Hoyle, make sure
you're not chasing shadows.

Hey, is she going to pay
for that paper?

Thanks!

What I'm saying is that if we're
not satisfied with this reality,

we create a new reality,
a more perfect one.

Yes, but perfect for whom?

-That's a revisionist reality, isn't it?
-Yes.

And the more the artist
escapes into it,

the further he separates himself
from the real world,

real relationships.

And thus, therapists make a living.

Salvador Dalí.

"Persistence of Memory." 1931.

Wonderful use of browns
in his palette.

I'll have to take your word for it.

See those cliffs in the background?

They say that's the coast
of Catalonia, Dalí's home.

So, he included something familiar,
even among all that decay.

The loss of reality.

Or maybe that's the memory
he couldn't escape.

You an art historian?

Couple different things.
Not enough to quit my day job.

Of course, my day job's at night,
but, hey...

I think we're supposed to be
embarrassed by this.

Yeah.

You know, I never understood that.

Me neither.

Hoyle.

Nice to meet you, Miss Hoyle.

You need a drink?

I'm a girl who never drinks,
but knock yourself out.

How do you take your brandy, Miss?

In a glass.

SINGER:
So, you into surrealist art,

or you just come here
for the fashion?

I'm actually looking for someone.

Or he's looking for me.
I'm not sure yet.

SINGER:
Dudas.

What do you know about Dudas?

I know he's in pain.

The human psyche's the most
beautiful thing in the universe.

So resilient, yet so fragile.

I want to show you something.

There's a wing through here
that's closed off.

"Urban archaeology."

It's what Dudas
was dabbling in before...

You know.

A lot of people think it's like
fitting puzzle pieces together,

chunks of life,
divorced from their context.

But I like to think of it
as more like...

like shutting off your left brain,

seeing beauty in things
the way they are,

realizing it's all disconnected--

or connected, in a different way--

and being okay with that.

Shutting off your left brain, right.

A lot of cultures say that
you perceive reality more clearly.

Aborigines' dream-time,
Indian peyote rituals,

or just plain alcohol, of course.

The choice of the urban shaman.

Give me a puzzle with an answer.

Pieces that fit like they were
made for each other.

Things don't always
fit perfectly, Hoyle.

Sometimes it's the rough edges
that make life interesting.

Somebody told me once,
"The mind is like a surge protector."

It prevents you from experiencing
certain things.

Is that what you dragged me
in here to say?

You mean non-linear things.

Reverse causality,
precognition, déjà vu.

Excuse me, ladies.

HOYLE: You, um...
You said Dudas is in pain.

It's become his home.

How do you know?

What if the surge protector
could fail

from emotional overload?

Jolt you out of this linear façade.

Trauma creates ripples.
Some of 'em slip through.

[Cell phone rings]

Oh, I gotta get back.

I'm staying at the hotel
down the street, room 6626.

Drop by
if you want to chat sometime.

[Phone rings]

Dammit!

[Knocking on door]

Yeah?

[Door opens]

We need to talk.

I'll meet you for dinner tomorrow.

Wait a minute.

DUDAS:
Tomorrow night, same time.

HOYLE:
Dudas!

[Phone rings]

Dammit!

[Knocking on door]

Yeah?

Long night?

Not long enough, I guess.

What's wrong?

Shoulder acting up on you again?

I'll live.

Listen, if I tell you something...

You ever heard
of these experiments?

A series of images
shown to a test subject?

Now, most of them
are harmless, pleasant,

but every once in a while,

a traumatic picture
appears on the screen.

Turns out, the subject
has a negative response

a fraction of a second
before the picture appears.

You mean this is some kind
of evidence of-- of precognition?

I mean that trauma creates ripples.

Some of them slip through.

Somebody's messing with me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Look, Hoyle.

I'm fine.

Really, I'm fine.

What are you doing here?

Hello.

I was wondering if I could speak
with this professor.

Oh. I-- I don't think so.

Maybe I can help--

I really need to talk to him.

What's this in reference to?

A lab notebook.

An old journal
I think he might know about.

Hey, what are you? Like a cop
or a reporter or something?

I think you should leave.

And tell your friends they're not
welcome here anymore, either.

Somebody else has been here?

Look, that professor doesn't
teach here anymore. He's... old.

Like, older than you.

You, uh... you should go.

Thanks for your time.

Drop a dime if you want to talk.

What is--? What is this?

Is this his work?

What is this number?

Research in this field is...
very progressive.

Our work is not for public view,
you understand.

DUDAS:
Time never earned my respect...

Ma'am? Ma'am, are you okay?

[Siren wails]

NURSE:
Blood pressure at 80/40.

MEDIC 1:
Get 2 large bore IVs in her.

Pulse-ox 95%.

How you feeling?

HOYLE:
What happened?

You got clipped.

HOYLE:
No, I...

That's...

What are you talking about?

Took a shell in the shoulder, sister.

You're lucky.
Looks like you got 8 lives left.

<i>TV: If you had to do it over again,

CORONER:

Thanks.

How many folks
wear that kinda iron, huh?

Hoyle, tell me ballistics isn't going
to match that pill to your piece.

Is there something
you're not giving me here?

I'm not sure.

I don't know how long I can keep this
between you and me.

I understand.

I gotta take off.

Thanks.

Thanks for everything.

<i>* And you don't know me</i>

<i>* For just one second that was true</i>

<i>* Keep me feeling so brand-new</i>

<i>* You know why yesterday...</i>

I'm late. I'm sorry.

How are you today?

Better than last night.

I can agree on that.

I'd offer to buy you a drink, but
I see you've, uh, got a running start.

I fund my own vices.

Stubborn as always.

Shall we?

<i>* Did I sell my soul

<i>* You know why yesterday

<i>* I can't keep thinking

<i>* Don't go</i>

Not bad, huh?

Did you ask me here
to discuss music, Mr. Dudas?

Never one for small talk, were you?

Okay. I've got a theory.

People say my work

is about fitting disjointed
puzzle pieces together, right?

What if the pieces don't fit?

What if your mind
is like a surge protector?

It keeps you from seeing
the disordered nature of time,

and-- and reality, and...

I'm being-- I'm being ridiculous.

What you got there?

Come on.

Planck's constant?

Excuse me?

It's the most fundamental constant
in nature.

You see, all the stuff
in the universe is really just waves.

And everything vibrates
at a wavelength,

related to a mathematical constant.

WAITRESS:
You like another?

-No, thank you.
-Please.

You know, some people believe
there are other realities,

alternatives, similar to this one,
yet the details are changed.

We can't see them

because they vibrate
at different wavelengths.

And every choice we make
spawns another.

It's pretty amazing, huh?

A simple decision
can create an entire world.

Or destroy one.

Do you remember this time?

This place, this conversation?

I remember.

It doesn't have to end this time.
Not anymore.

You know, maybe--
maybe you should...

John, don't start on me
about this again.

Yeah. Yeah, I know.
It's one of the reasons.

You ever going to let me know
what the others are?

Oh, please.

You know what bothered me
the most?

You pretended
that we were nothing more

than peripheral acquaintances.

Something about that struck me
as so disingenuous.

This wasn't a good idea.

You haven't moved on.
You haven't moved on.

Moved on? I don't even know
what that means-- "moved on!"

Look, I'm not dwelling on you.

I don't sit at home at night, drowning
my self-consciousness in bourbon.

But have I put you away?
In my past?

No. No way.

This was a mistake.
I'm sorry.

This was a mistake.

NURSE:
Hey, you're awake.

How you feeling?

What-- what happened?

TRENCH COAT MAN:
You tell me.

Guessing you went to talk
to that professor,

but you passed out.

Lucky the girl there knew CPR.

Wait a minute.

Wait a minute, I feel like...

Did we do this...?

NURSE:
Hold on there, hon! What...?

-You pay a visit to the university?
-Why?

The student there said I wasn't the
only one asking about the notebook.

You know who she could be
talking about?

No, but I don't like it.

Make it your business to find out.

[Phone rings]

Hello. Doct--

Yes.

Wait. Where are you?

Hi, Doc.

Well, you aren't crazy.

It's not like you're prone
to cognitive dissociation,

but you're certainly not immune to it.

People can experience
that condition when--

It's not a "condition."

Well, from the way
you described these events,

I'd say that's what's going on here.

They're not "events."
It's not that specific.

It's more like-- like just a general
feeling that things are off.

Time is off.

But at the same time, it's not.

Look, something
is happening to me,

and I think...

And I think someone's doing this.

They're either following me
or they're one step ahead.

-Listen.
-I feel like I'm losing.

I need you to tell me
I'm not losing my mind.

All right, all right.

Look, I want you to take
a deep breath...

Don't patronize me.

and tell me
how long you've been here.

I knew you wouldn't believe me.

Look, we both know
you have a problem.

I haven't been drinking.

I put down a couple, okay?
So, shoot me.

You want my help or not?
You called me here for a reason.

Yeah.

Yeah, I did.

I keep coming across a term
in something I'm investigating.

Fenestra.

Fenestra aeternitatis.

"Window of eternity."

Jung believed there's
an idealized female archetype

deep within a man's psyche.

It's called the "anima."
Latin for "feminine soul."

Yeah.

Some feel that this anima
is a sort of bridge

between personal self
and higher knowledge

held in the collective unconscious.

When a man falls deeply in love--

when he projects his anima
onto a woman--

she can become
his window to eternity.

Hey, be careful.

You're getting
into some pretty obscure stuff here.

Just trying to figure out
how I fit into it.

I'm a Jungian.
I'm not a fortune teller.

[Phone rings]

Hello?

Hello?

Anybody home?

SINGER:
Can I help you?

Not the kind of stuff
you'd find in a museum, is it?

You? You're the psychic?

SINGER:
A girl's gotta make ends meet.

I just help out here
when I'm in town for a gig.

Of course you do.
What a coincidence.

Are you following me?

Whoa, hold on there.

Don't bullshit me. I saw you.

Hoyle, I'm here to help.

You know the arrangement.

You remember?

Yeah.

Yeah, I think so.

Good.

So...

Again...

Can I help you?

Ask questions. It's your job.

How is Dudas involved in this?

Where is the lab notebook?
Do you know what's in it?

Wait, wait, wait.
These are...

I was thinking more like,
"How's work?"

"Do you like this weather?"

"Want to grab a bite?"

Let's grab a bite.

You keep odd hours.

Look who's talking.

I work better in the dark.

I see better.

That's interesting.
I didn't know it worked that way.

Your crystal balls
and your Tarot cards

didn't tell you that, huh?

Check this out.

Run-of-the-mill
sweetener packet, right?

One gram.

And there was something
like 5,000 grains in here.

Take my word for it.

Okay.

Okay.

So, how much
did each grain weigh?

Total weight
divided by number of grains.

0.2 milligrams.

Really?

How many weighed
exactly 0.2 milligrams?

Well, it's their average weight.
That's the whole point.

No, it's not.

The point was to figure out
the weight of each grain.

Keep talking.

Formulas only give approximations,
averages based on models.

Science is incomplete.

There's something deeper
we can't define beyond probability.

So, you're about to tell me
that's what mediums do,

tap into the deeper level.

I'll let you in on a secret:

Crystal balls and Tarot cards
are just devices

to shut off the conscious mind.

Anything where there are
patterns within chaos.

Lines on a palm,
reflections in a gemstone.

Tea leaves.

SINGER:
There's nothing "magic" about it.

Divination isn't about specifics.

It's about understanding
the patterns of our world,

how they repeat,

creating a "hole"--
a "window to eternity"--

and tapping into the collective.

It's all psychology,
if you believe in that stuff.

What about... numbers?

Symbols.

An intricate sequence.

Could that do the trick?

I'd love to find out, wouldn't you?

We compiled as much urban lore
on the notebook as we could.

Haven't had time
to read through all of it.

Anything grabbing you?

Depends what you have in mind.

[Knocking on door]

Hi.

Hi.

Wow, this gets better and better.

You gonna gawk
or you gonna talk?

Oh, yeah. I-- I--

I just want to say I felt bad
about what happened in the lab

because we weren't
very nice to you.

I, uh...

Well, glad to see you're all right,
in any case.

Good. Good.

All right.

Do you want anything?
A glass of water? Coffee?

I'm fine, thanks.

-Bourbon?
-Please.

So, you think maybe...

If you were free,
if you might be interested in...

Sorry.

Look, I know what you guys
are going to ask me,

but I can't squeal
about that notebook.

There's no way.

So, they say this notebook
hasn't been seen

since the Second World War, right?

Some of the greatest minds
in 20th-century physics

worked for these underground
societies in Germany back then.

I'm talking nontraditional research.
Alchemy, occult arts.

-Really?
-Yeah. We're only beginning to understand

the consequences of their work.

Most of it was never made public.

That's fascinating.

So, this backdoor research
you're doing, how does it fit in?

Let me set the scene first.

How do you know
where you are in life?

You're asking the wrong gal.

Seriously, how do you know?

Your memories.

Okay, think of time as a row,
a sequence that always exists.

You orient yourself
in the sequence--

you know "when" you are
by looking at what's behind you.

What's supposed to have
just happened, your past.

You can't see the future,
but that doesn't mean it's not there.

Go on.

Now, what if you were jumping
from place to place in the row.

You wouldn't know the difference,
would you?

Because at any point, you'd only
be able to see what's behind you,

what's supposed to have
just happened.

So you're saying
that everything that I experience--

I'm saying linear time is a myth,

an illusion forced on you
by your left brain.

You don't live life in order,
you just think you do.

Hold on.

I've heard this theory.

What if I told you it's not a theory?

A few decades ago, Feynman
and Wheeler cooked up something

called "time-reversal symmetry."

The idea is that everything
in the universe

is actually the same stuff--

existing over and over again
in different places, different states.

Back up a minute.
Different places at the same time.

It's been known to happen.
It's called a "cat state."

A side-effect
of nonlocal entanglement,

what Einstein called
"spooky action."

Cut to the chase, kid.

Don't you see?

Extend the metaphor
to people, thoughts.

The same consciousness...

Skipping back-and-forth
through time,

forever re-experiencing realities
from other perspectives

like some cosmic 'clerk'
is shuffling different events,

different lives, only giving
the appearance of distinct selves.

Okay.

Even if what you say is true,
why all the cloak-and-dagger?

Certain knowledge...
it can be dangerous.

Try me.

You know, I wouldn't be telling
you guys this if you were... guys.

No kidding.

All right.

All right.

Some cutting edge paraphysicists
in Europe

are conducting
thought experiments

into ways that time-- reality--
can be reversed.

The idea is that, if you could
experience true non-linear time--

what some call "dream time"--

then you could interfere with reality,
just by making choices in your life.

Would there be any observable
phenomena associated with this?

Side-effects?

Like...?

Uh, electrical?

I don't know. Maybe.

But you think the answer's
in the notebook?

That's just it.
We don't have the notebook.

Nobody knows where it is.

Somebody knows.

"Let us go, through certain
half-deserted streets,

The muttering retreats

Of restless nights
in one-night cheap hotels."

He can't love, you know.

That's why Prufrock wanders
through half-deserted streets.

He won't allow himself to love.

Do you think he's right?

Do you think that's the system?
The way things work?

Kinda out there, isn't it?

What if someone could perceive
linear and non-linear time?

If something happened--
something happened to the sequence

so that you could interact
with memories,

change them.

Well, that would mean--

It would mean something's off,
something's not working right.

A jam in the cycle.

A jam in the cycle.

The totality
of human consciousness,

accumulated, rarefied,
distilled in one person

without even being aware of it.

Tell me one thing.

Why?

You broke something.

Wait!

Wait.

What if something you did--
if something somebody did--

caused the system to bottleneck,
to fragment?

What makes you think
you could fix it?

Well, what would you do?
Wouldn't you eventually try...

Come on, Hoyle.
It doesn't mean anything.

Forget about it.

Listen to me!

If it were true,
what would you do?

Well, I guess...

Once you realized--

at least, once you suspected
what was happening--

I'd say you'd try to warn yourself.

Get a message through.

At first, it would probably be
little things--

phone calls, e-mails, pictures.

But after a while,
as you got better at it,

as you learned to manipulate
the rules of the chess game,

you'd leave subtler clues,

you'd try to create thoughts,
dreams, feelings,

people.

I'll never catch on.

I'll never get through, will I?

It doesn't mean you can't keep trying.

Maybe you need a little help.

Walk me to my room.

Come on.

Hello?

Hello?

[Bell dings]

Yes?

Who are you?

CLERK:
I'm the Clerk.

Can you help me?

What can I do for you?

[Indistinct speaking]

HOYLE: John.

You're not real.

John, I think it might be a good idea
if you stopped this,

all of this.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

I'm talking about reveling
in your own misery

because you're too goddamn afraid
to turn a corner.

John, there are other people
looking for this thing,

dangerous people.

You coming or not?

HOYLE:
John, honey, listen to me.

I think-- I think you're going to set
something in motion here,

something you can't stop.

You know what I think?

I think you picked a hell of a time

to start worrying
about what happens to me.

John.

John!




I'll be all right.

What the hell?

I'll be all right.

It's okay. It's not that bad.

You sure?

You sure?

Yes.

We gotta get you to a hospital.

John, give me the notebook.

Give me the notebook!

I will not let you
take our past away.

-I will not let you!
-John!

Stay away from me!
You get outta my mind!

Oh, my God!

You remember your birthday?

Of course!

It's beautiful up here.

We snuck off together over there.

Yes, we did.

Happy birthday.

I marked some parts
I thought you'd like.

Thank you, sweetie.

Am I your sweetie?

Yes, you are.

John.

John, are you okay?

Everybody's worried about you.

It stopped, you know.

I go through the motions.
Everyday, mechanical existence.

But... time stopped.

Look, hurting you
wasn't easy for me,

but life is hurt.

It's trial and error sometimes--
that's how we find ourselves.

The errors injure others.

That pain goes somewhere.
Where do you think that pain goes?

It goes from one person to the next.
It becomes part of the cycle.

And you know
what the most terrifying...

the most exhilarating part is?

Our capacity to not get over
the past--

our sincere desire not to move on.

I'm clinging to that
like there's no tomorrow.


No tomorrow.

Because it's uniquely,
remarkably, human.

John.

John, I'm sorry. I--

I didn't know it would do this.

Then don't.

Don't this time.

We didn't fit.

We didn't have to.

The world's not black-and-white
because you see it that way.

For some reason,
I remember details the most.

Details have a way of taking
on their own significance, don't they?

This...

Reflections off the water,

you standing before
100,000 tiny lights,

an extraordinary sense
of contentment.

Could you put that in the past?

John, what have you done?

You didn't just break my heart,

you broke your promises.

I'll never understand that.

I'm here.

Are you all right?

Oh, God!

Oh, my God! He's stuck!

He's trying to bend...
It's unraveling... He...

I need your phone.

It's out.

There's a pay phone
around the corner.

Let's go.

[Phone rings]

Come on.

MACHINE:
Hoyle. Start singin'.


Dammit!

Where are we going?

My place.

HOYLE:
John?

John, wait!

John?

John!

Hang on!

No...

Grab my hand!

For God's sake, John,
drop the notebook and grab my hand!

No, let me go.

You'll die!

Let me go, please.

John, drop the notebook.

Stop haunting me.

Stop haunting me.

John, you are pulling things
into the present,

things that are supposed
to live in the past.

They're memories.

You're not respecting time.

Time never earned my respect.

I think you dropped something.

Wait.

Wait!

Let him. It's all right.

Open it.

Go ahead, open it.

You're looking in the wrong place.

It's not about a notebook.
It was never about a notebook.

You still think there's some formula
that could explain all this?

No.

No, no. I am not crazy.

How is this happening to me?

You made a choice.

For John, it was the wrong choice.

It was the right one for me!

Then why do you keep
coming back here?

Choices have consequences, Hoyle.

No, no.

Look, you're dealing
with the tip of something

that really isn't comprehensible.

Your mind
chaining dissociated events

from different perspectives,
different realities,

into some kind of coherent story.

You mean experiencing dream time.

I mean experiencing regret.

I don't care if you attribute it
to your loneliness,

or your need to connect,
or your guilt over hurting him.

He speaks to you.

He sees you all the time
in his heart.

When he wakes up

and realizes
you're no longer there...

chaos, disorder
come rushing in again.

You were an important part of him.

That doesn't just evaporate
when you decide it does.

What are you saying?

He's putting himself into my life?

Or the other way around?

<i>* Where do you start?</i>

<i>* How do you separate the present
from the past?</i>

<i>* How do you deal with all the things
you thought would last?</i>

<i>* That didn't last?</i>

<i>* With bits of memories
scattered here and there</i>

<i>* I look around
and don't know where to start</i>

<i>* Which books are yours?</i>

<i>* Which tapes and dreams
belong to you</i>

<i>* And which are mine?</i>

<i>* Our lives are tangled
like the branches of a vine</i>

<i>* That intertwine</i>

<i>* So many habits
that we'll have to break</i>

<i>* And yesterdays
we'll have to take apart</i>

<i>* Someday there'll be a song</i>

<i>* Or something in the air again</i>

<i>* To catch me by surprise</i>

<i>* And you'll be there again</i>

<i>* A moment in...</i>

<i>* What might have been</i>

<i>* Where do you start?</i>

<i>* Do you allow yourself
a little time to cry?</i>

<i>* Or do you close your eyes
and kiss it all good-bye?</i>

<i>* I guess you try</i>

<i>* And though I don't know where,
and don't know when</i>

<i>* I'll find myself in love again</i>

<i>* I promise there will always be</i>

<i>* A little place no one can see</i>

<i>* A tiny part, deep in my heart</i>

<i>* That stays in love</i>

<i>* With you</i>
