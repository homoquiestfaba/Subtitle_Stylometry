Okay.

A million dollars.

Can you imagine?

Drink to Woody.

I do not want to ruin the party but

all know this is

a farce, gained nothing.

Nice try  Ross.

're Past that.

Ross is right,
gained nothing.

Try to keep it secret so that

not come to ask for money.

I understand.

True, Woody is not a millionaire yet
.

We should all remember that.

But tomorrow will be a different story
.

What is the first thing you will do with the money
Woody?

First.WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

Buy A truck

and a compressor.

What will you do with a compressor?

Need paint.

Å»SeguirÃ¡s you working?

No.

only must replace the compressor that Ed was

Why do not you
for him while you're in town?

Come on David.

Guys will not do that.

I will shoot  for
old piece of junk.

Am I the only string in this family?

Ok, Mom. All right.

But Ross thought to drive later.

To see the old house
dad.

That house.

You still still there?

There is a farm there.

But never demolished.

's Still there.

Why want to waste their time watching that?

Must be filled with rats.

Papa, will you go see it?

What?

David and I want to see where you grew up.

Why?

What makes the man?

Just go to the cars pass.

Remember when we were kids

and we had chairs all afternoon to see the track?

Yes

Hello David, Hello Ross.

Good to see you guys again.

We can not let so much time pass
again.

Yes Thanks Aunt Betty, good to see.

But something is
hard to say.

Feel it deserves to be mentioned.

What?

Good.

Well you know...

Woody has always had money problems.

The family helped him occasionally.

So in view of their good fortune.

We think your family would

fix things.

've Heard that quite lately.

You know, Cole and my people would not say anything if you only
out for them but,

are in this too.

Å»Dicen they want money from us?

Well because we think...

Family
Woody took over and that.

I stood tall.

We help and we were quite rich.

But it was my brother.

Could not bear to see the suffering family.

Aunt Betty Listen, guys...

To be frank and honest.

Woody gained nothing.

Is a farce.

're A fucking liar.
Do not give me that Ross.

You wanna fight?

Let's do it.

Watch my face,
'm on TV.

What is it?

Have they gone mad?

Aunt Betty and his thugs
request repairs.

Why?

's "" Profit "" Dad.
They say we owe them money.

You see, no money?.

Money?

Betty  What are you talking?

Help Woody know
when taken everything he earned.

You know as well as I was
backwards.

They did work on your car for free.

They got free fuel.

Not ask for much, only
symbolic.

I took records.

The money they gave him no
approaches what you are owed.

I could not tell anyone not
.

That ruined.

I think you're delusional.

Where do you think you got that money when

you went and opened that room?

From my parents when they died.

I can not believe what they do.

Usually a person has to die before ronden
vultures.

Worry, we did not want to imply anything
.

It was just a courtesy before
speaking directly with Woody.

Not dare to ask for money.

Is not poor, he is rich.

Even if you were not you would
a dime.

Not allow it.

Maybe not up to you,
Aunt Kate.

Enough.

Listen carefully.

Can go fuck each other.

Guys, go by his father.

What do you think man?

It looks almost the same.

That is true.

Here's how your mother did.

My dad built this place.

Really?

Yourself Why?

Yes, before I was born.

His brothers helped him.

I can.

This was my room.

That's where Brother Woody died
.

Remember that  Daddy?

Right.

This was the room of my parents.

They hit if he came here.

Guess nobody is going to hit me now.

The barn is still standing.

Zya seen enough?

Guess.

Just a bunch of old stuff.

Ever wanted to be a farmer
like your father?

Not remember.

Not matter.

There's the old farm hares.

She is dead and in the nursing
Valentine.

One son still lives there.

Ahi is the place right Ed.

What are you doing?

Let's do it.

're Here.

What do they want?

Papa, do not you want to see if you still have your
compressor?

Enough of this nonsense .

Dad,
finally have your compressor back.

That's not my compressor.

Yes it is.

Mine did not look well.

Has to be yours.

Is an old compressor that found in the barn of Ed

That was not the barn Ed

you talking about.

It was the home of Westendorf.

Oh yeah you're right.

Clear the Westendorf .

Ed lives closer to the people.

I got confused.

Ed's wife, Dorothy.

Oh My! sow that was it.

Anything you want to say about the Western
old?

No, are good people.WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

They had hard times.

Lost a son,
almost run out of money.

But they worked hard and saved the farm.

deserved what you did to them.

Papa did not you tell us that
that was not the home of Ed?

Did not know what the hell.

Have you ever seen our
steal a machine before?

I never know what they are doing.

Why do not you say it was not yours?

I thought you wanted it.

For what would we want an old compressor?

That was what I could not understand.

Hi George, Hello Jean.

We remember?
We are Kate and Woody Grant.

Sure, how are you?

Well, we were going and thought we should greet

I have twenty dollars.

Å»Veinte? No!

Was thinking, say 10 mil.

10000 Dale dad.

Woody ,
I always thought we were friends.

Remember it was you who convinced you to stay with
Kate.

If David, your dad wanted a divorce.

Why
was fucking a girl in the bathroom.

I thought I was in love.

Woody Is not that right?

When was this dad?

After Ross was born before you.

If I had not been here
possibly you were not here.

At the time
divorce was a sin.

Now I guess it's okay.

God must have changed his opinion or something.

Though do not blame Woody.

Because Kate was always a fucking.

Away from us.

I want that money.

Move.

Okay little David.

Let's do it your way.

But this is the last time the old
Ed will play fair.

I have.

Å»PapÃ¡ okay?

Where is what?

Just give it back.

I do not know what you mean buddy.

Ztu know?

Of course not.

Where is he?

We do not.

Shut up.

The throw.

We saw how stupid it was,

Not mention anything about this to Mom or Ross

They say you came back to your senses
and go home.

Å»Suena well?

Okay, at least a little change of scenery

And I am happy that
