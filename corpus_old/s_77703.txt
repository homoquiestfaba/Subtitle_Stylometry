(siren blaring)

(dog barking)

Quigley!

TV Host:
Spin again and risk it all,

or walk the plank
and risk your life.

(audience chanting)
Walk the plank! Walk the plank!

Mrs. Darmstetter?
It is a big one.

Oh, hi!

You left your door open again.

Heaven's sake, I wonder
how that happened.

So, how is everything?

Well, I'm worried
about my mail.

I think someone's stealing it,

because I haven't received
any letters from my kids

in a long time,
and they always write.

Are they taking all your mail
or just the letters?

No, just the letters.

You'd think they'd take everything else,
wouldn't you? But they don't.

Yeah, well, I'll talk
to the super about it, okay?

And if you want,
I'll keep an eye out, too.

Thanks, hon.

I...

I got dessert.

For heaven's sake,
I couldn't eat that whole thing.

Okay.

I suppose
I could eat some of it now,

and save the rest for later.

I suppose. Here you go.
Thank you.

I'm gonna be home tonight,
if you need anything, all right?

Good.
Okay.

Bye, me too.
Yeah? Okay.

¶... Like an angel ¶

¶ From above ¶

¶ Bring me home ¶

¶ Oh, you bring me love ¶

¶ I was lonely ¶

¶ Until you showed me ¶

¶ You made me feel those things... ¶
Hey, babe.

Hey.
¶ I never felt before... ¶

I know, I'm early.
I'm not gonna stay.

I just can't stop
thinking about tonight.

I had to see you.
Are you mad, hmm?

Well, you know, we did say
after rehearsal, right?

I know, and I'll be back
after rehearsal.

I just had to make sure you weren't having
any second thoughts.

This is a good thing
for us, you know.

After rehearsal, Carla.

How hard is it to fix a leak?

My outside key
didn't work again, either.

That guy with the dog
finally let me in.

I called the guy eight times already.
Fix the damn leak.

Just fix it.

So, you told Dwight you were gonna
be out of town this weekend, huh?

Is that the story?
Yeah, I know.

I don't get it.

I don't get it, Tepp.

Why lie?

Why not just say,
"Dwight, I can't do it." Huh?

There's nothing wrong with that,
if it's how you feel.

It's easier.
Yeah?

Except now, you can't
even come see my show.

I'll say my plans
fell through.

Why go through all that trouble?
It doesn't make any sense.

You know what?
Here's Tepper.

Here's Tepper,
and here's the truth.

And you go
all the way around,

just to end up right back
where you started,

where you could have been
straight up front in the first place.

TV: If these are your numbers,
you're six million richer!

It's silly.

As silly as pretending

to not check your numbers,
when I know you do.

So, I'll see you tonight, right?
Yeah.

You'll be here?
Yep.

Yeah?

I'm just confirming that
we have a date tonight.

Carla, you waited
six months, right?

Uh-huh.
Do you want to spoil the whole thing?

No, not if it's
a good thing.

I'll see you tonight.

Have fun with
your poker buddies.

Okay.

And I'll see you tonight.

Elephant juice.

I love you too.

Hey, loser, it's Coop.
Can't make it tonight.

Order for delivery, please.

Name's Tepper.

What listing, please?
Avery Phillips.

What city?
Manhattan.

Checking Avery Phillips.
No listing in Manhattan.

Any other boroughs?
No, sir.

Okay, thanks.
Thank you.

Avery, you should keep
a number in here, buddy.

Recording:
No one is available right now.

Please leave your message
after the tone.

Hi, Victor.
If this is you,

I found a wallet tonight.

It belongs
to an Avery Phillips.

Your number
was inside the wallet.

So if you know this guy,
have him call me.

My name is Tepper,

and I'm at 555-0186.

Actually, I'm gonna
be here all night,

so if you want to tell him
to stop by, he can.

My address is
411 West 13th Ave, apartment #7.

And if this isn't Victor,

sorry to bother you, man. Bye.

10.

23.

91.

(intercom buzzes)

Yeah?

It's Fish, I'm standing
in a river out here, let me in.

Come on up, Fish.

Recording: Tonight's Big Three jackpot
is worth $6 million.

The winning numbers are: 10...

23... 91.

To hear the numbers again,

press one.

Tonight's Big Three jackpot
is worth $6 million.

The winning numbers are: 10...

23... 91.

91! 91!

10, 23, 91!
Okay, right!

Hey, Fish, you're not
gonna believe this.

Do you ever check the numbers
before we play?

What?

Just say the word. Do you ever check
the numbers before we play?

No.
No. Of course not. Why?

'Cause the rule is,
you don't look.

You don't look. I don't look. Bolan
doesn't look. Cooper doesn't look.

But that pinhead Quigley,
look, it's numbers time,

and he's got his freaking TV on, so loud
I can hear him from the stairwell.

And look, I'm not saying
he's checking the numbers

but that kid put the thought in my head.
You know I don't trust him, right?

I don't trust that kid.
Why you're friends with him

makes no sense to me at all.
He's gonna rub off on you.

You know that little
rodent mole stink he's got?

It's gonna rub off on you.
Wake up one day be like,

"Jesus Christ, Mary, Joseph,
what is that stink?

Oh my God,
I smell like Quigley."

Better yet,
wake up in 40 years

and not have a friend,
it's 'cause of him.

Some people, they don't get it.
He doesn't get it.

Give to the Red Cross,
give to the United Way,

but this whole friendship charity
crap has got to stop.

I'm done.
I just need a beer.

I need a beer like a crack whore
needs a big fat rock.

And please, tell me you did not
just buy them across the street,

from the little punk who's
too cheap to turn on his freezer.

Oh, you're killing me, Tepp.

Cold beer one week,
that's all I ask for.

We're playing unlimited tonight.
None of this 50¢ cents max crap.

You know I owe everyone.

(intercom buzzes)
Wanna bet that's Bolan?

Bet you it's Bolan and
he's got to take a piss.

Yeah?
Tepper?

It's Fishman.
Get your ass and bladder up here.

Fish, let me
ask you something.

I found some guy's wallet
on my way home today.

No phone number.
No driver's license. Nothing.

I left a message with
this guy named Victor

whose number
was in the wallet.

Got any money in it?

No. I don't want the money.
Don't say you don't want the money!

'Cause if you don't want the money,
I want the money!

Okay, but I'm just trying to figure out what I
should do with it.

In this city what do you do,
give it to a cop?

Better chance of throwing it out
the window and him getting it.

So, what you're saying,
I should just...

forget it?
Don't worry about it?

If the guy's not smart enough to put
his number in the wallet, screw him!

(knocking)
I'll get it.

You're right.
It's just...

Get rid of it.

Holy cow, I gotta pee.
You're consistent, I'll give you that.

I've been holding in
so long, it hurts.

Shouldn't hold it in. Wear your
bladder out, have to wear diapers.

That's all I need...
sterile and wearing Depends.

At least I still got my hair.
Easy!

We're playing unlimited tonight,
none of this 50¢ max bullcrap.

Oh boy, I think I may have done
permanent damage this time.

You guys can say what you want
but those pills are working.

Thick as muff, this thing.

I feel good.

I look good.

I shouldn't be playing at all tonight,
so much going on with Carla.

We should make it
an early one tonight, okay?

So start already!

What the deuce?

10 to one on Five
it says it rains all night.

You know, statistically,
I never win when it's wet.

(knocking)
I hate this crap!

Yeah, Jake Poster, please.

What's up, Fish?
What's up fellas?

Who do you like tomorrow?
SC or Notre Dame?

Are you making a bet?
I'm having phone sex with your wife.

Who do you like?
Notre Dame.

Poster, it's Fish.
Give me three bills on SC.

Yeah, that's very funny.
Thanks.

I'm the one who played college ball.
You never ask me.

Suiting up is not playing.

Gotta win some cash tonight.
You know I got guys after me?

That's 'cause you bet
with money you don't have.

Stopped by work with a two by four,
missed me by five minutes.

I brought wine.
Hey, more pilferage.

Bolan, don't! It's not pilferage,
we're allotted so much a month.

Yeah, for business.

For whatever, I am a wine salesman.
Everybody does it. It's part of the job.

This a Bar-Mitzvah? You don't bring
wine to poker, for crying out loud.

My friends,
it's time to play.

We need to get it moving here,
I'm popping the question tonight.

So, bet big early with the deuce.

We're here five minutes,
getting grief already.

I'm just saying,
a bottle here, a bottle there.

Please, stop the lecture.

Look, if one of my counselors
takes home a box of pencils,

it's three bucks,
it's no big deal, right?

But if everybody takes home a box,
that's 300 bucks,

and somebody's
paying for that...

me. Companies lose
billions in employee theft.

Oh, now it's theft!

That's his point.
That's what pilfering is, it's theft!

You know what? Screw you, guys.
If you don't want to drink it, don't.

I'm not coming down on you, boy.
Yeah, you are, Bolan. You always are.

Dance with me.
I don't want to dance with you, Bolan.

When was the last time
you loved yourself?

Okay, Bolan, you've got
to stop with the therapy.

No, it's not therapy this time.
It was a seminar.

Power of suggestion.
Change your life.

Save your breath, Bolan.

The Quigley Mantra
will always remain the same.

"What they don't know,
won't hurt them."

Am I right, Tepper?
Yeah, I'm staying out of that.

You know what? You guys
got to learn to live a little.

Open yourself up
to new things, you know?

Hey.

How was "Jeopardy"?
Or was it "Wheel"?

I forgot.

Hey, Tepp.
What is it that comes on

right after the lottery
numbers?

I don't watch that stuff.
Fish?

Must have been another apartment.
Did you guys see the ring he scored?

What the hell's he talking about?
Under the second drawer.

What is he talking about?

This is great.
Got that for two bills.

Look at that.

Fell off a truck, did it?
Something like that.

It's a starter ring,
he can move up later.

Looks like
your kind of ring, Quigley.

You're smart not
to invest a lot.

It's nothing towards Carla,
but marriage can really suck.

No, your marriage sucked.
'Cause you're an idiot!

Carla's a keeper.

Love that girl.

Give me this.

Hey, Tepp!

Now, that's class!
Stolen ring?

Great way to start a marriage.
It's perfect, it's just what I wanted.

Gimme a hand with this.

Depending on what
date you set,

I've got to get you
up to camp.

You hang out
with the kids.

It's an experience,
it will bring you closer.

Okay.
Okay? One more thing,

Dance class.
Come with me.

Yeah.
Okay.

Carla knows something's
happening tonight, right?

Something damn well better happen.
She gave him the six-month deadline.

It wasn't a deadline.

Time to think, whatever.
The point is, you made the right choice.

Tepp,
when you do it,

do it right.

Get down on one knee.

Make her feel cherished.

I mean, she'll never forget it.

I hope these are okay.
Best I could find on a short notice.

They should have cost 10,
but they were in the $5 bin.

So, we got a deal.
What?

The guy says to put them in the fridge
and keep them fresh for tonight.

Hey, Quigley, it's cool,
don't worry about it.

You guys want a beer?
Yeah!

Grab mine,
it's on the counter.

And a water.
And wine for the whiner.

Tepp, listen,
if you decide that later

you wanna give Carla
something a little more substantial,

let me know, okay?

'Cause I got a guy,

and he can hook you up,
he can trade that thing in,

get you something
real special, okay?

Okay, great!
Okay.

What?
"I got a guy."

"I got a guy."

Where's Coop?
He's not coming.

What do you mean he's not coming?
That putz owes me 50 bucks.

Listen to me, Tepper.
He calls and I wanna talk to his ass.

Six million tonight, fellows,
and it's all mine!

Mary must have squeezed your brain.
You ain't taking shit.

All right, I'm bank.
There's a surprise!

And we're playing unlimited tonight.
None of this 50¢ max bullshit.

Let's get that chair out.
What are you doing? You sit here.

Will you turn that shit down!?
I'm sitting here tonight.

That's not your seat. You sit here.
Who cares where he sits?

I do!
Yeah, I'm sitting here tonight.

That's not his seat, that's
Coop's seat. You sit here.

Fine!

Like an old lady.

Thank you.
Cough it up, let's go.

Let's go!

What's this? This isn't enough.
We're playing unlimited tonight.

We're not playing
unlimited tonight.

Yeah, you know I might have
in the other chair over here.

But not now!

50¢ max,
three raises limit.

Same as always, buddy.

Thank you for your help.
Thank you very much.

You're welcome.

Tepp!

The wine.
Oh. Okay, yeah.

Thanks, Teppo!

What is this?
$10.

$10? Quigley, you've got to be
freakin' kidding me!

That's all I've got. Lay off!
Every week, it's the same thing.

The cab ride over costs more.
You know that, right?

You've got to get married
if only for the food.

You want me to walk?
(intercom buzzes)

Now, we're talking.
I got it.

You've got big brother
Bolan, come back.

Good evening,
this is Avery Phillips.

I'm here about the wallet.
Yeah, one second!

What happened?
Holy shit, what d'you do?

Nothing, I just cut myself.
Well, do you have a Band-Aid or...

peroxide?
I'm fine.

See now this
is the perfect time

to have your sweetie wrap that thing up
for you and kiss your little face.

Why don't you get the wine
for Quigley? Bring it in.

Intercom: Hello?

Hey, Tepper damn near pulled
a Bobbit opening your pilferage.

I had an opener.

Wine and poker are like horse
and church, they don't belong together.

Tepp, I had an opener!
Intercom: Hello?

You think I'd show up here
without an opener?

Nobody's thinking
about you at all, Quigley.

Yeah?
This is Avery Phillips.

Yeah?
You found my wallet.

Yeah. You're Avery?
Yes.

You called my
brother-in-law Victor.

Can I come up?

Yeah.
Come on up, Avery.

So listen, I cop a squat
and I drop a deuce.

Hey, Tepp, what are you
doing at the door?

The guy with the wallet,
he's coming by to pick it up.

I thought you said
there wasn't anything in it.

How the hell am I supposed to know?
The guy wants his wallet.

This shit was so big,
Mary couldn't believe it.

You call your wife in
when you take a dump?

I'm proud of it.
What? I've got no secrets.

That's sick!
That's intimacy.

Tepp, stop banging on your freakin'
leg already. You're driving me nuts!

So look,
the point is,

this thing's so big,
I clog the freaking bowl.

It cost me 65 bucks
to snake it.

I can't believe your wife
actually has sex with you.

You know what? Twice last night
and once again this morning.

And it's off the charts.

Pretty soon she's
gonna be all pregnant,

and I'll be kissing that belly,
rubbing her little feet.

Big brother Bolan's
gonna be big Papa.

Tepp, my sperm, they're
screaming for nourishment.

What's up with the food?

Tepper?
Yeah.

I'm Avery Phillips. I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

In New York City,
this doesn't happen.

You're a good soul.
It's no problem.

It's still kind of wet.

It's mine, all right.

I hope everything's in there.

That's how I found it.
I'm sure it is.

Good luck to you.
Would you mind

if I used your phone, called my wife,
let her know I found it?

She's worried sick
about the credit cards.

Unless you're
in the middle of something?

No, No.
It's no problem.

It's fine. Come on in.

Noah's Arc out there.

Phone's in the kitchen.
I won't be just a minute.

So, what's the deal?
You found this guy's wallet?

Yep!
Teppo did his good deed for the day.

It's not gonna help him
tonight, though.

Did you take the money?

There wasn't any in it.

That's what most people do.
They take the money, leave the wallet.

It's what the putz
before him did.

No!
That's a solid thing you did.

You know what,
that comes back to you.

Yap, yap, yap.
Bolan, it's your game.

Closest to bull
gets the deal.

Let's go!

I'm so zoned in tonight, fellas.

20 minutes, haven't
won a dollar yet.

Can you get ahold of her?

No. One phone's not enough
with a house full of girls.

Darts, huh?
That's a sign you're hearing.

Yeah, closest to bull.
You want in?

His wife is worried.
He's got to get home.

It takes two minutes.
Fish, the guy lost his wallet.

He doesn't have
any money on him.

I got money.
Avery.

You're gonna let this guy sucker you?
He's gonna take all your money.

Yeah, then lose it.
It's a buck!

I haven't played darts
in years and years.

You know, why don't you
give me the number?

You give me the number
and I'll call her your wife, and...

I gotta take a shot
at that bull.

If that's all right?

Yeah, that's all right,
you got a buck, you're in.

Tepp, get the man a dart.
Let's go! Chop-chop.

I'm Bolan.
Avery.

Nice to meet you.
I'm Fishman, I need a dollar.

Let's rock and roll.

So let's start. Come on, guys,
you say you wanna play

but then you sit around
and yack all night.

Quigley, just throw. You go first.
I'm up. Let's do this.

Don't come from here,
come from here. Feel it.

Yeah, I'm feeling it, Bolan.

The story of my life!
You weren't feeling it.

You weren't feeling it. Watch me.
Watch where it comes from, okay?

Watch where it comes from.

Center.
Center. Center.

I'm feeling that.
Tepp throw.

Oh yeah, notice
who's going last.

What's that? I can't hear you
with my dick in your mouth.

Think about what
you're doing, buddy.

See? Now Tepp's feeling it.
See, he's feeling it.

Aren't you glad you don't have
to listen to this all night?

Are you kidding?
I'm enjoying this.

I haven't been out with
the fellas for a long time.

This is for the deal, right?
No!

Can you just throw the dart, please?
Yeah, but...

You know what? I think that
Avery should get the last shot.

What do you think?
That's fine.

Don't get me wrong,
normally I'd say stay.

Tonight, it's gonna be
a little night.

A couple hands, tops.

I nail it, I don't get nothin'?
Wax on, wax off.

I can't say no to a game of cards,
even if it's only one hand.

You get a shirt.
You get a new shirt. I got new shirts.

Fish, look at this guy,
don't take advantage of him.

Come on, Avery!
Kick his ass.

Kick his ass. I'm gonna bet you
a dollar that he kicks your ass!

A whole dollar?
You're on!

Yeah! He kicked your ass!
You owe me a buck.

Well, easy five bucks,
huh, Avery?

You're still a barely employed
borderline alcoholic with no future.

You know what?
Let's get you out of here.

...make your life tolerable,
your little dollar.

Let's play cards.

Won a buck.
Avery, let me get your stuff.

(sirens blaring outside)
Hear that? Something's going down.

Who's bleeding?

Tepper, bleeding like a little girl.
Don't get your blood on it.

Let me get your box. The rain thing.
That's all? Only one game?

Why don't you sit down?
We're just getting started.

Check it out.

You did win the deal.
It's low stakes.

Somewhat friendly.

I can get you an umbrella.
A real one.

Sounds real tempting.
I got like 100 extra.

This game could use
the money, let me tell you.

We got an open chair.

Here's your new shirt.

Told you. Two cop cars out front.
Middle of the street, baby.

You don't have to twist my arm.

No, guys!

No.

Not tonight.

It's just not a good night.

A got a lot on my mind
and, uh...

I'm getting engaged
tonight.

Any other night,
it would be a good night, but...

tonight's not a good night.
I'm sorry.

No, I'm sorry, Tepp.
You're absolutely right.

You got a lot on your mind.
There's cops everywhere, guys.

It's all right, Bolan.
It's just, it's not a good night.

Thanks for
understanding, Avery.

I'm the one sorry.
I didn't mean to overstay my welcome.

Oh, for crying out loud.
Is this a poker game or an AA meeting?

Everyone's so sorry about everything.
You know what?

Another night,
huh, Avery?

Drop by again.
Sure.

I won't forget
what you did.

Good night.
Good night.

Get back in your apartment.
Close and lock your doors, sir.

What, are you deaf?
Get your ass back in your apartment!

This isn't his apartment.

I don't care whose apartment it is, close the
door!

(intercom buzzes)

Oh, it's got to be the food.
They're gonna seal her up.

Hello?

This is Officer Campbell, NYPD.

We've secured your building
for police investigation.

Do not open your door
until you hear from an officer.

We should get you
out of here now,

before you get stuck
in the building.

No, no.
I'll wait a second.

That is a smart man.

Guys, they closed off the building. We're
on lockdown.

Hey, what'd I tell ya?
Tepp, lock that door.

I don't want to get shot.

The roof is next.
Then they're going to go door to door.

There's one guy that
needs to get out,

he needs to get home.
Just real quick, okay, man?

Hello, NYPD?

Avery...

I know I know you.
What do you do?

I'm a...

I'm a bus driver.

There goes that, huh, Bolan?
Last bus you took was short and yellow.

Hey, make sure
that's a cop.

Hey, Mrs. Darmstetter.
How you doing?

Honey, why are
all the police here?

You know, I'm trying
to find that out myself.

They're all over the place.
Yeah.

Go back in your apartment,
I'll find out what's going on.

Okay.

Hey, Mrs. Darmstetter?

Lock your door and stay there
until I tell you it's okay.

You'll let me know?

Yeah, I'll tell you.

I can't believe they can
close down an entire building.

Only in New York.

Look, Avery, I'm sorry.
If you want, I'll walk down with you.

Whatever, you didn't
hear the cop?

We're closed up.
He's not going anywhere.

He's stayin'
and he's playin'.

Huh? Am I right, Ave?

Well, I must say,

it gives a convenient excuse.

Thank you.

Fate throws that in your lap,
you gotta grab it. Am I right?

Avery, let me
get that for you.

It's a 50¢ max,
three raise limit.

Give me your cash
and I'll give you some chips.

Heretofore known as the bank.

Hey, Tepp?
Where you going?

Getting something to drink.
You got drink.

Sit the butt.

Look, I'm not a card player.

You just tell me when
to bet and I'll do it.

Who-o!
That's what I like to hear!

Why don't you get on
him for 10 bucks, huh?

You grow a set of
balls with that beard?

He did have the lucky throw.
It's your deal.

Oh, uh...

Somebody else
should go first.

Oh, I'll deal.
Ah! Deal goes to Grizzly Adams.

Six of hearts, six of hearts,
six of hearts.

Just deal, Kreskin.

Come on, Quigley.
Deal.

Tepp, what's with these cards?
They're all the same.

I don't know.

Carla got them at
the MGM Grand in Vegas.

That's the way
they came.

It's not a salad.
Deal.

Seven card, no peek.
Already with the monkey games.

Keep it up.
I like wild cards.

(imitates monkey)
Monkey games.

Tepp.
Sorry.

Tepp, no peekie.

Guys, it doesn't matter.
It changes the way he bets.

It's okay. I gotta leave a message
with Carla anyway.

See? Now he knows
he doesn't have a hand.

Tepps, we're one card in.

Hey.

When you talk to her,
don't forget what I said.

Way he's acting you'd think he's
getting circumcised, not engaged.

He is getting circumcised.
He's getting married.

Hey.

What's up?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

No problem,
no problem at all.

I gotta get some
new silverware.

This is getting ridiculous,
you know?

Listen, I want
to thank you again.

My whole life
was in that wallet.

Well, you know,
I'm glad it worked out for you.

Mind if I try again?

Oh. Yeah, sure.

Do you mind?

You want some
privacy, I'm sure.

I was on "All My Children" last week.
No way. That's Mary's favorite show.

Hello?

You make some pretty
decent coin doing soaps.

A guy in my office hooked up
Susan Lucci, 10 rooms, Upper East Side.

This guy's on the phone all night.
What block?

Can't tell you.
What do you mean, can't tell me?

Stalkers and shit, I can't tell you.
He doesn't know.

The fuck I don't.

I know where a lot of people
live and I can't tell you.

Come on, Fish.
Mary loves that kind of stuff.

Who's gonna stalk
Susan Lucci?

I don't know, Bolan.
But say I tell you, okay?

And some freakin' freak overhears,
goes to her house and she goes down.

Cops, the media, the papers...
what happened? Nobody knows.

I know, okay? I know.
'Cause I'm the one that talked.

What are you saying,
that you got code?

Yeah, I got code. What's the fuck's
the matter with you? I got code.

I don't rat. I don't cheat.
And I don't pay for sex.

Now deal. As a matter of fact,
you lose the deal,

'cause you took
too freakin' long.

Texas hold 'em.
You know what, I got a code too.

Yes, you do, Quigley.
It's messed up, but you got one.

Bolan got code.
Bolan got code so pure

he don't even have
to think about it. Just is.

But this kid,

jury's still out on this kid.

He doesn't even hear me.

You have the number?

What are you
looking for, Avery?

I need a pencil.

That's silverware.

Here you go.
Here's a pencil.

What?

You know, honey, you're right.
You call him for me.

Thank you,
sweetheart.

We have to call work and tell
them we won't be in tonight.

Hey, Frick and Frack, we're playing Texas
Hold 'em. Are you in or out?

Sure.
Put a little hip in that hop.

So how old are
your girls, Avery?

One's eight, the other
just turned 10 last week.

October, that's the same as mine.
I got a five-year-old.

They're my grand daughters,
actually,

just living with us for a while.

Mine's in Florida.
Lives with her mom.

For now, anyways. She's...

she's got this prick lawyer.

Dumb Cuban,

going out of his way
to make me look bad.

I got a job.

Got a suit, got a tie.
I'm walking the walk.

I don't know what
the hell else they want.

Maybe they want you to move
to Florida and be a real father?

I would do that in a heartbeat
if I ever get out of debt.

You don't even know
what debt is, Quigley.

You ever been divorced?
Then shut your front door.

Hey, Avery, eight and 10's
a good age, huh?

Phyllis is already
into boys and baseball.

She's convinced she's gonna
marry this Derek Jeter fellow.

I bet against Jeter, once.

Once, never again.
Kid killed me in the ninth.

So good.
Renaissance man, that guy.

Avery...
does she have an autograph?

Well, how about that?

Think she'd like it?

What's that?

Your granddaughter.
Think she'd like to have it?

Damn Tepp, you already found
the guy's wallet.

Yeah, I think you've done
enough for me already.

I don't have any use for it.
It just sits there.

Tepp, you love that card.

I don't love the card.
It's just a card.

It's a pretty
nice offer.

Yeah, for a guy you wanted
gone a beer ago.

I'm your best friend. You never gave
my daughter anything like that.

Since when you his best friend?
And you are?

More than you.
Guys. What's the big deal?

Avery, it'd make me
happy if you took it.

Damn, Avery.
Take the card.

All right.

That doesn't mean
I gotta let you win, does it?

All right,
everyone's happy.

Could we play some
freakin' cards now?

Can you never just
enjoy a nice moment?

Bone me.
Play cards.

Hey, Tepp, I tried that
elephant juice thing today.

It works.
What's elephant juice?

When you say "elephant juice,"
it looks like "I love you."

I'm the one who
told Tepp about it.

Well, it sounds like Dumbo
coming in your hair.

It's romantic.

It's 5th grade,
it's talking around it.

You're getting married and
you still can't say, "I love you"?

I can say it.

When was the last time?
When was the last time you said it?

February '89, Paula Valley.

Took her to a Prince concert,
we rented a limo,

we wore purple,
and I told her I loved her.

To get in her pants.
No.

I meant it.

I did get in her pants.
But when I said it, I meant it.

Well, it's not
the same thing.

Okay.

But don't think Carla doesn't know
what you're doing, 'cause she knows.

I respect you for not saying it
if you don't mean it,

but if you mean it,
I think you should say it.

Amen to that.

Good or bad...
truth.

The only way to go.

Right on.

Cop: Roof is secure.

You hear that?
They're on our floor.

NYPD.

Doing an apartment search
and going door to door.

Doing the old lady
and we are next.

I got to use
the facility.

If they're checking apartments,
they'll want to check the bathroom.

Not if I was just in there.

No need for that.

Well then wait two seconds,
say hello, then go do your business.

No, I'll just say a little
hello through the door.


Yeah, don't worry, Avery.
NYPD.

We'll cover for you.

Guy's acting like an ass, huh?
Sketchy.

Simon says,
open the door.

Campbell, NYPD.
I'm gonna have to look around.

All right, Raymond.
Come on out.

Good thing that the game
is not going that late.

Raymond!

I hate the cops.

Who the hell are you?
Get out of the tub.

I got a bum leg,
just let me, uh...

Get out.

Okay, okay.

Come on, here we go.
Up, up.

There you go.

Step out in the other room,
put your hands on the sink.

All right, what's the story here?
Somebody talk.

Tepp, go ahead. You're the one
pointing like an arrow. Talk.

I don't know. You guys said
you were looking for someone, right?

And Avery, we just met him tonight.
We don't know who he is.

And as soon as
you knocked on the door,

he wanted to go run
and hide in the bathroom.

Three Mary two,
three Mary name.

Last of Phillips,
first of Avery.

Avery, I didn't know.
You just were acting weird.

Officer, we were
just trying to be cautious.

Yeah, that the deal, Officer.
You never know about people.

All right, Avery Phillips.
You got a driver's license,

something with
your face on it?

I did.
It's not in there?

Nope.

Somebody must
have lifted it.

I lost my wallet
earlier tonight

and Tepper here called me
over to pick it up.

Yeah, it's true. I was just
trying to do the right thing.

I didn't know
it was missing.

You're a fireman, huh?
Retired.

I drive a city bus now.

New York's bravest.

Stub your toe,
you're a hero.

We get shot,
we had it coming.

What's your route?

What's that?

Bus route.

Bronx.

Specifically where?

Broadway.

All right, Avery.

You're not who
I'm looking for.

And I'm sorry about that,
I'm ready to go home.

But I am curious to know
why you were hiding.

Well, it's kind
of complicated.

You see, I got a couple
of parking tickets.

Parking tickets?

Like I say,
it's kind of confusing.

See, l... I'm trying
to get them sorted out.

I don't know the status.

Radio: Phillips, first of Avery.
Two warrants out of Queens.

Failure to pay
parking tickets.

Well, I'll give you a little update.

They're warrants, that's their status.
You're wanted.

City bus driver,
you could lose your job.

I'm aware.

You a family man?
Yes.

Why would a man
jeopardize his livelihood

over a couple
of parking tickets?

They were unjust and
I'm contesting them.

Well, aren't you
the moral one?

You need to arrest me?
Go ahead.

If I decide I have to rap you
with my nightstick

upside that brave head
of yours, I'll do so.

I don't need
your permission.

All right,
consider tonight a gift.

Enjoy it.

You know, Avery
really just wants

to go home.
His wife is worried.

Well then Avery shouldn't
have wasted my time.

I'll tell you when
you can leave.

All of you.

Oh, boy, Avery.
You gotta be kidding me.

You run from the cops,
you got warrants.

You're a black man
in this city and you get off?

That doesn't happen.
Toto, wake me up.

There were some definite
power issues going on.

Look, Avery, l...

I'm sorry. I wasn't trying
to get you in trouble.

I understand.

Hey, what were
you trying to do?

What?
What were you trying to do?

What do you mean? You guys
weren't thinking the same thing?

Soon as he heard the knock he wanted
to go run and hide in the bathroom.

You know what, Tepp,
I don't care what went on, but

with all he's got on his mind,
I guess it's expected.

The fireman's fine, all right?
False alarm.

Zip it, skip it.
Let's play some cards, huh?

You okay?
Yeah.

You sure?

Yeah.

Wait a second.
Avery Phillips.

Avery Phillips.
I knew I recognized that name!

You're Mr. Fire Safety.

You spoke at my dad's
summer camp.

Echo Lake.

Oh, sure.

You're a hero.
Hey, this guy's a hero.

Tepp, I told you about this, right?
Yeah, yeah, that's wild.

He saved
his partner's life.

Pulled his partner out of a hole
with his leg, this man.

With his freaking leg,
he pulled him out.

That was a long time ago.
Still a hero.

If you're a hero,
why are you driving busses?

Quigley!

I got a pretty big family
to feed, and...

disability just doesn't
go far enough, so...

Say, Mr. Fire Safety,

I don't know if you heard
about it, but...

my dad passed a year and half ago.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, man.

Oh, no, thank you.

But anyway, I'm running the camp now, and
we're doing great.

We got all these kids
with special needs, and...

we just got to get you
back to camp!

Okay.
Story time's over.

What do you say we play
a little poker, huh?

Any poker at this point!

Wild card, seven card, peekie,
no peekie, I don't give a deuce!

I just wanna play
some cards, please?

Thank you.

You know, I say we play Last Man.
Juice things up a bit, huh?

We haven't played
a game of regular yet.

You're not the boss. Come on.
Yeah, you're not the boss of us.

So we'll play regular after?
Yeah.

I thought you didn't give a deuce.
That's fine. Avery...

We play for lottery tickets.
Last man standing takes them all.

Do you have a ticket?
Yes.

Actually, Avery, why don't
we trade places here?

I think this seat's going to be a little more
comfortable on your knee.

Then I can sit over here
in Coop's seat.

Oh, that's nice.
I like that. It's soft.

You are unbelievable.

Tepp, let's go.
Ante in.

Oh, yeah...

I'm not in this week.
The hell you aren't.

What do you mean,
you're not in?

I forgot to buy a ticket.
That's bullshit! You're in.

I'm serious.
It just slipped my mind.

You don't have
a ticket at all?

Sorry,
I had a busy day.

I meant to buy one
on my way home.

But then I found
Avery's wallet, and...

I don't know,
I guess I just forgot.

Well, then I guess
you don't mind

if we check in
your little hiding spot.

Go ahead.
Knock yourself out, Sherlock.

It's not that we don't believe you.
I've got nothing to hide, Quigley.

How do you live
with yourself?

How'd you forget?

For the tenth time, Bolan,
I just forgot, it happens.

That's lame. You should
be penalized for that.

What's the big damn deal?

The big damn deal is,
that's the way we play.

Yeah, that the way
¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh, we play it. ¶

Front pocket.

What's that?

Left side.

Shirt pocket.

What are you
talking about?

Empty the pocket.

Fuck you.

Yo, Tepp.
Yo, Bolan. What?

Empty the pocket.

What's in the pocket?
What's in the pocket?

What's in the pocket?
Get away!

For cryin' out loud!

Guys, it's time
to settle down, okay?

We're supposed
to be having fun.

This isn't camp, Bolan.

I came here to play cards.

I am so sick and tired
of screwing around.

Tepper, you're acting
more Quigley than Quigley.

I am so sick of you guys
bagging on me.

Why are you doing this?
We know you got a ticket.

You guys are the biggest
bunch of dicks.

Oh, we're dicks.
Oh, we're dicks.

Like you never bought
an extra ticket, right, Fish?

Extra tickets?
What are you talking about?

You can buy a freakin' 100
extra tickets for all I care.

All you need is one.
For here.

Well, I didn't have any time
to buy extra ones.

All right?
This one's...

this one's for Carla,
for tonight.

Maybe he's got a winner.

Yeah.
That's it.

That's it.
I got a winner.

No, he doesn't have
a winner.

If he had a winner,
he wouldn't be here.

Wait a minute, you really
think I do, don't you?

I just hope you're getting
frequent flyer miles

'cause you're all over
the freakin' map tonight, kid.

Call 'em if you do.
Go ahead, call 'em.

I don't want this shit
hanging over my head.

For crying out loud.
Seriously, Fish. Call 'em up.

Fine, all right!

You want me to call 'em?
Fine, I'll call 'em.

Forgive me for wanting to do
something special for my girlfriend.

If I may.

When trust between friends is broken,
it can never be repaired.

If you challenge him
and you're wrong,

that could haunt
this group forever.

Avery's right.

This is stupid.
So freakin' ridiculous.

Sit the butt.
Let's settle this.

The rule is,
you don't look.

Ever.
For any reason.

That's the rule and it's very simple.
Quigley...

look me in the eye.

Did you check the numbers?

I never have.

Bolan?

I know the answer,
but I have to ask.

No.

Tepp?
No.

Avery?

I don't know you,
but I'll trust you.

If you know the numbers,
you can't be in the game.

Do you know the numbers?
No.

Okay, then.

What about you?

No.

I never have
and I never will.

Let's play
Last Man Standing.

Avery, you get this, right?

You know you could
lose your ticket?

Winner or not.

I think I understand
the game.

No mistaking
which is yours.

I'm sorry, guys.

I don't know what
my problem is tonight.

I know what your problem is.
You're scared.

And you ought to be.

Doing what you're doing.

It's risky.

No, it's only risky if you pick
the wrong woman.

You haven't.

It's just marriage.

It doesn't mean forever.

One way or the other,
it'll be over soon.

Not soon enough.
Let's play some cards.

All right, Avery.
It's a very simple game.

Five-card draw.
I deal counterclockwise,

low man out on each hand.

Stay off the bottom
and you stay alive.

That deck ever make
its way around to me?

No, Fish always
deals Last Man.

He doesn't trust anybody.

For some reason,
we indulge him.

New rule: Anyone gets up
for any reason, you're out.

All right?
Agreed?

Hey, you guys,

does anybody smell that?

That's cat piss.
Tepp, you need some Renuzit.

Uh-oh. Witch doctor's
got a good hand.

What you got,
witch doctor, huh? A pair?

Maybe two?

Why do you call me that?

You call me that every week.
What's it mean?

You want to know?

Okay.

All right.

Seeing how everyone's
coming clean, starting fresh,

I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret,

all you guys... one of the reasons
why I constantly kick your ass,

and you're gonna remember me
come Christmas-time.

Quigley, every time
you have a good hand,

you get so excited
you start spinning things,

just like this,
twisting it around.

Yeah.
Dead give-away.

It's a tell.
Tells me all I need to know.

Everyone's got one. You don't know
you're doing it, you just do it.

Perfect example... Bolan.

Every time Bolan
is bluffing, he starts

tapping his foot like
he's got palsy or something.

Like he's screaming,
"Look at me, I'm lying!"

I guarantee you he's got nothing,
first one out, I bet you anything.

Tepper,
on the other hand,

like a Russian novel.

Very hard to read.

Especially tonight.
I need a Geiger counter for him.

Yeah, you don't show much.
Haven't figured yours out. Yet.

What's yours?

Quigley, I just got done
telling you, it's unconscious.

If I knew,
I wouldn't do it.

That's why it's called
a give-away.

Unbelievable. I hand you
the keys to the kingdom

and you can't even walk
through the freakin' door.

All right, big man Avery.
How many do you want?

Three.

Three for the big man.

Witch doctor?

Quigley!

What you got, two pair?
Going for that little full house?

Just play.
Bolan?

One, two, three, four cards.

Thank you.

Tepp?

Don't need a tell
to read that.

Man takes three,
dealer takes three.

That stinks, I can't believe
you guys don't smell that.

What you got, Ave?
Turn 'em.

Oh, pair of sixes.

Not too strong, but strong enough
to stay in the game, I'm betting.

Huh, Bolan?
What you got, Quigley?

What's that right there?

Witch doctor,
working the mojo.

Two pair. All you got
to do is beat two sixes.

What you got, Bolan?

Oh.
The queen.

Tepp, all you got to do is beat
a queen to stay alive. And he does.

Pair of three's.

It's a tough way to start
the game, huh, Bol?

What do you got?

Oh, let's see here.
What do I have?

There's one boy.
Here we go, starting early.

Oh!
And there's another.

The pair of boys kicks
the shit out of your bitch.

Bluffer holds true to form.

One down.
Three to go.

See how it works?

Last man alive
gets the pot.

All right that cat piss is killing me.
I'm gonna open the window.

You're out.

Yes!

What?
It works!

You're up,
you're out.

No, no, no.
It's you can't get up during a hand.

Bye, bye.
Guys, it worked.

What? Bullshit.
No, Bolan, it didn't work, okay?

That was a domestic thing.
I was doing it for everybody.

No, Quigley.
Check it out.

It didn't smell like cat piss.
I just said it did.

I suggested it.

You should have been
at that seminar, buddy.

What the fuck are you talking about?
Come on!

You guys are rough.
No kidding!

Look enough of this
Mickey Mouse crap.

This coming from a guy
who calls seven card no peekie.

Hey, guys.
Can I get a little credit here?

I mean I think I should have
been on "All My Children."

Come on, Tepp.
Back me up here, huh?

It's called tough love.

Embrace it.

Whatever.
I don't care anymore.

Yeah-huh.

That leave three of us.

All right.
We got A: Old and wise.

B: Good looking and young.

And C: All of the above.

Let's just see what happens,
shall we, boys?

Pow.
How you feel about that one?

Bingo!

Yo, yo, yo. I got a little
something-something in the window.

He's peeping again.

Bolan, please.
Go suggest he jump.

Two girls.
One's clothed.

One's in a bra,
they're trying on clothes.

She is definitely 18.

Bolan, check that out.

No, thank you.

What's the matter with you?

They've got the window thing up.
They want you to look.

How high up do you
think we are?

How high are you?

You sure you don't want
to take a look there, Fish?

A little coquette in the window
just for you.

We are playing for
six million bucks in here.

No time for high school
peep shows.

Okay, we're down
to panties now.

We're down
to panties now.

And you can see right through them.
Come on, Bolan.

Three stories up, straight across.
I won't tell anyone.

Give it a shot.
Maybe I'll spot the food guy.

Spot the food guy.

You know, I've always questioned
the fascination with voyeurism.

Must be one's lack of...
holy mother of God!

Oh, shit!

You knew! You knew!
The one time I looked.

The one time.

Welcome to my seminar.
Come here.

Avery, how many you want?

Two.

Ein, zwei.

How'd those feel, Avery?
They feel sexy those cards?

Tepp.

God.
Oh, Christ.

Oh, God.

You know what?
Just go ahead, deal.

No, go clean that thing up.
I'm not leaving the table.

I'll watch the tickets.
Go clean that thing up.

For crying out loud,
it's making me sick.

You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. Hurry. Go.

This means you're out.

It's worse than puberty in there.
This kid's like a rabid dog.

Just going on what you said.

I think under the given
circumstances...

Right. Sort of like a home court advantage,
I guess.

You can call it that.
Hold up.

Avery, you want
the tickets that bad,

just take 'em.

Oh, no wait.
Hold on a second. Clip the lip.

First of all,
I'm still in this game.

Second of all, no one's out.
I said he could go.

You the king?
I didn't agree to anything.

Maybe it's because
you don't have a vote.

Fish...

I got a ticket in that pot
and I figure I got a vote.

You figure wrong, old man.

'Cause you're an outsider
and you're outnumbered.

So don't come to my game
and tell me how it's played.

Back off!

You're out.
He's up, he's out.

He's not out.
Whatever. If I'm out, he's out.

Fuck that.
You're out too.

He's not out.
I told him he could get up.

When did you
become a pit boss?

Fishman, how can you do this?
Every single time you change the rules.

You're not the boss.

I've had it...
Guys, guys!

You know what we do
when the kids can't get along?

We end the game.
Hey, hey! Bolan!

Relax.
Don't panic.

Then stop your freakin' whining.
You're worse than my kids.

Now, I'll be the arbiter.

Okay?

That's fine.

What I say goes.

No arguing, no debating.

Just ca...
Just shut up for once!

Avery...

are you going to be okay
with my call?

Sure.

He's not out.

He's not out.
Meaning he's still in.

So. I'm in. Right?

Yes. You're in.

Oh, this is fun.

Do you have to say that
every five minutes?

What?

For crying out loud.
You say it every other sentence.

So what?
So, it's annoying.

So, grow up.
You're an ass, Fishman.

And you can moonwalk
back to fuckland.

Having fun yet, Avery?

It must be great
having kids, huh?

Kids are wonderful.

First time around...

it was great.

Now that I got
the grand-daughters,

light of my life.

I'd do anything
for my girls.

I bet you would.

You know, all day,

I'm at camp, working
with my kids, but...

but I don't have
any of my own. Yet.

I got all these people
telling me that

I'm not ready.

But I feel like you're
only not ready

if you haven't lived
enough life for yourself.

I have.

I want 'em.

My wife and I are having

a little trouble
getting pregnant.

I was at this clinic today.

And this nurse puts me
in this little room

and gives me...

a big butt magazine.

So I do my thing,

and when I'm done,
I peep my head out

and l...

what do I do
with this container?

This nurse says,
"Leave it on the shelf."

I'm sorry?

I mean, my self-esteem
is at an all-time low.

I'm in a little green closet
with big butt magazine,

suspecting that
my semen isn't potent.

And you want me
to leave it on the shelf?

So I left it on the shelf.

What'd you do
with the magazine?

What's he doing in there?


Uh, yeah?

Hey, how can you
stand Fishman?

He's ridiculous.

D'you mind? I gotta whiz.
Sure, go ahead.

Fishman!

Tepp. I literally can't do this
with you standing behind me.

There he is.
About time.

Avery and I made up.
BFF. Best friends forever.

Sit it.

We'll play some cards.

(music plays)

That's disgusting.

What do you guys suppose
the chances are

that one of these
is a winner?

One in 900 million.

Sh-h.

Tepp, I'm gonna use your phone.
I'm gonna call my daughter.

I've got one
of those calling cards.

All right, Tepp.
How many you want?

Three.
Three.

Dealer takes three.

That's right, Avery.
I'm coming to get ya.

All right.

Let's turn 'em, boys.
Avery, what you got?

Oh.
That's not bad.

That's not bad
for a fireman hero

turned bus driver with
two outstanding warrants.

A, B, C.
Tepp, your turn.

Roll 'em or show 'em.

Tepper?
Roll 'em or show 'em. Let's do it.

Aw! Bitch!

I get my daughter her own phone line
so I can talk to her once in a while,

her mother takes it
off the hook every night.

Nice, huh?

Fantastic.
Tepp!

Stop with the drama.
Roll your cards, please.

Tonight would be fantastic.

I will.

Am I missing something?

All right, I'll tell you what,
I'll make it easy on you, Tepper.

See you start
with a pair of threes.

Then you go right in

to the pair of eights.

Bang, bang, boom.

Come on, Tepp.
Can you do it?

Well,

I think I can.

Fish.

Oh. I think he's pulling
a Fishman.

I believe I have

these two aces, Fish.

And... oh, what's this?

What's happening?

Oh, and a third one.

What'd you have?
Two and draw one?

Yeah, something like that.
I got lucky.

Something I never
have been.

Unbelievable.
I lose with two freakin' pair?

I can't buy a freakin' break.
Where's the phone?

I gotta cancel a bet.

I'll deal.

Yeah, let Houdini deal.
I gotta get a plan.

Now there's a surprise.
What'd you say?

Nothing.
I'm gonna deal.

Damn. Feels like a deck
and a half in here.

What do you say we use
a new deck for the last hand?

Tell him Paul Fishman's
on the line.

Yes, I'll hold.

You know, the funny thing
about lottery tickets,

it's such a leap of faith.

I've been playing
the lottery for 10 years now,

one ticket every week
for 10 years.

And I always play
the same numbers.

I'd sooner forget my birthday
as my lottery numbers.

And I always buy them

from the same little
Korean fellow.

He's got a place right across
the street from our church.

Every Sunday, after I thank
the Lord for my blessings,

I sneak in a little
prayer for myself.

And I say,
"Dear Lord, this week let me win."

Then I take the girls
across the street,

and buy them juice
from the little Korean fellow,

and buy me
a lottery ticket.

The odd thing
about this Sunday,

the little fellow
wasn't there.

Sick or something.

First time in 10 years.

But I buy the ticket
anyway from his wife.

Same numbers,
different hand

punching them
into the computer.

And I say to myself,

Is this a sign?

Could this be the week
I'm going to win?

Maybe the good Lord knew

I needed a different hand
typing in the tickets.

So he made
the little guy sick,

just so I could win.

Then I go and
lose the ticket.

And you find it.

And here you are
gambling it in a poker game.

Now here's where
the faith comes in.

If the good Lord
intended me to win,

and mine is the winning ticket,
I'm walking out of here with it.

Because,
He wouldn't do that,

play a trick on me
like that.

Because he's too busy
screwing with me. Deal, Quigley.

You listen to me,
you little rat bastard.

You tell him Fishman's
calling back in two minutes

and he better
pick up the phone.

That's unbelievable.

I have the only bookie in New York
with a freakin' receptionist.

Hands on the table, fellas.

I don't want
any controversy.

Hey, guys. You think we'll still be playing
poker in 50 years?

God, I hope not.

And take your time.

Six million reasons
not to screw this up.

(music plays)

I think we should split it
if someone wins.

Since when?
I've always thought that.

Especially after everything
that's gone on tonight.

Then why even play?

I don't know, Fish.
For the fun of it.

What is it with fun tonight?
This isn't supposed to be fun.

This is gambling.
There's winners and there's losers.

Yes, I'll hold.

How many, Ave?
One for Ave.

Hi, Mrs. Darmstetter.

Tepp?
How many?

Well, sure you can,
you've done it for me before.

Honey...

What?

Do you think they'd know
to check the basement?

How many, Tepp?
The police.

Draw time. Let's go.
How many?

Tepp.
Mrs. Darmstetter.

I don't know.
I'm sure they do.

Are you telling me all the money I bet, you
can't do me this one thing?

Remember the exterminator?
Come on. How many?

He didn't know.
Tepp, pay attention.

He's worked this building for years.
Pissing me off, this guy.

If he didn't know,
how are they gonna know?

Unbelievable.
Draw, Tepp, how many?

I don't know, but
they know, okay?

How many?

Hello?
I want to double my bet.

I want six bills on SC tomorrow,
do you understand me?

Maybe you should say something.
I want you to count 'em out for me.

She's trying to talk to you.
I'd say something,

but they're not going
to listen to me, an old lady.

Where are you?
Bitch.

Tepp, Tepp.
Tepper.

Pissing me off this guy.
The exterminator.

Tepp.
Where's your head?

Maybe if you said something?

Would you put
a fucking sock in it!?

I'm sorry.

Mrs. Darmstetter, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

Oh God,
I didn't mean that.

I'm having a rough
night here.

I would never hurt you.

I would never ever hurt you,
I'm so sorry.

You know that, right?
You believe me, right?

This isn't about you.
What happened just now is not about you.

You scared me.

I know I did.

I've never seen you like this.

Yeah.

Yeah, me neither.

Could you please forgive me?

I forgive you.

You want to stay here
and watch some TV?

No, I guess
I better get back,

in case somebody calls.

Are you sure you're all right?

I'm okay.

Good night.

I dealt you already.

Ave?


Tepp?

I got nothing.

You got a flush.

Hey!

You don't draw a three for a flush
in a two-man game. That's idiotic.

You don't deserve to win.

You don't draw a three
for a flush ever.

I mean the chance of that
happening are like zero.

Unbelievable.
Quigley, get out of my seat.

Tepp, take your tickets.

Why don't you ever play like that
when my money's on the freakin' table?

Take your tickets, Tepp. Here you go.
I'm gonna check the numbers.

I'll do it.
That's okay, I got it.

Quigley, give me
the phone now.

It's ringing.

Still want to split it?

Tonight's Big Three jackpot
is worth $6 million.

The winning numbers are: 10,

23,

91.

To hear the numbers
again, press one.

No winners.

Hey, thank God for that.


Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

Will you get the door,
Bolan?

All right, turns out
you guys are not

the biggest idiots
in the building.

Raymond got himself stuck
in the garbage chute,

ass end up.

I live off 229th.
I'm gonna keep and eye out for you.

Now you can leave.

Thank you, Officer Campbell.

Finally, we can play
some freakin' cards.

Too late, Tepp.
No take backs.

What's done is done.

What are you doing?
I'm going home.

Well, no.
It's still early yet.

Not for me.

Bolan!
Yeah, guys. I gotta call it too.

What, are you kidding me?

We've only played one
freakin' hand all night.

Well, we can go
again tomorrow night.

I can't play tomorrow.
Tonight's my poker night.

Hey, guys, I'm cabbing it.
Anybody wanna share?

I'm so tired of humping
this freakin' ride.

Guess it wasn't in the cards
today, huh, Fish?

And the sun just set on another
day you gave head to, Quigley.

But what does that
do for me? Huh?

Avery, it was nice
to meet you.

Guys.
Later, Bolan.

Hey, you want your cash?

I guess that's for me.

You probably want to get
going too, huh, Avery?

Let me... let me get
your jacket and stuff.

No need to rush off just yet.

God, I thought
they'd never leave.

Sorry, Tepp,
this had to happen.

Did you see that?
Did you see how smooth I was?

Three clubs right off the bottom.
Like butter, I'm smooth.

Avery, I'm going
to get a towel.

No, you didn't catch that because
I'm Kreskin, mother-fucker.

What the fuck?

It's okay,
it's okay.

We got an emergency,
411 West 13th, apartment 7.

Tepp, Tepp, hey,
hey, no, no.

That doesn't work!
Get away!

We got $6 million,
God damn it!

We got a winner here.
I'm protecting our money.

Tepp, our money.
We've got a winning ticket.

You said no winners, Tepp.
He lied. He had to.

And Bolan would never go for it.
Why are you doing this, Quigley?

Because it's his ticket.
And he can prove it.

What are you talking about?
Because Fireman Frank here

plays his grand-daughter's
birthday.

But neither one of you
caught that did you?

I did.

I did.
Quigley did.

Show him the ticket, Tepp.
Show him the ticket.

First number: 10.
Month: October.

Second number: 23, day.
Last number: 91, year.

October, 23, 1991.
He plays his grand-daughter's birthday,

and he's been
doing it for 10 years.

And don't you think
for a fucking second

that all his neighbors in the hood
don't know about it,

probably planning
a big ol' barbeque right about now.

We got no choice,
we got no choice here.

Think about it, think about it.
Four white boys.

Four white boys
rip off a...

a Black man.

A hero no less.
We're fucked.

At the very least we have Al Sharpton up
our ass for the rest of our lives.

Plus, this is the kind of guy
who doesn't even quit his job.

Screw that.

Screw that.

I'm quitting.

I'm getting
my daughter back.

You're getting those guys off your ass,
and Tepp, you can do whatever you want.

Oh, God.

It's him or us.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

Stop it.
Stop what?

This was your idea.
Please.

(intercom buzzes)

You guys, shut up.
Stop it.

Carla:
Hey, hey. It's me.

Let me in, baby.
I'm drenched.

I wanted to look
so good for you, too.

Can I tell you something?
I am really nervous.

I know it probably
sounds silly, but...

I don't know. It's like
our first date all over again.

You're going to have to let me in.
My key is jammed again.

Tepp.
Don't bring Carla up here.

It's not a good place for her.
Not now.

What are you doing up there?
I am freezing.

Let's go, let's go.
Let me in.

Help me with him.

If it's about the guys,
I don't care if they're still there.

I'm sure they know everything
that's going on anyway.

I'm trying real hard to give you
the benefit of the doubt right now.

Come on, I've waited
six months for tonight.

Tepp, if you have something
to say to me, then just say it.

Don't leave me
standing out here.

You know what
the problem is?

You never chose me.

I asked you out.

I kissed you first.

I wanted to get married.

You never once took
the initiative with anything.

You just let it happen.

Now you're doing it
again, aren't you?

Well, I'm tired of waiting.

I'm tired of spending every
moment trying to figure out

what it is you want
and how I can be that.

I'm just tired.

We'll straighten it all out
tomorrow, all right?

I promise you we'll
straighten it out tomorrow.

No we won't.

Fish, you won't be
straightening it out tomorrow.

What are we doing, man?

We're friends, Fish.
What are we doing?

Oh, come on.

You're friends.

Since when do friends
cheat each other?

Yep.
I caught that too, Tepp.

And since you're feeling all righteous then
why don't you tell Fish?

Tell Fish just how good
a friend you are.

See, Tepp.
I figured out your tell.

When you're lying,
you look him straight in the eye.

Yep.

He cheated you, Fish.

He looked you straight in the eye
and he cheated you. Three aces?

Three aces, my ass.

You cheated me, Tepp?

I did.

I'm sorry, Fish.

You dumb-asses.

30 years I've been waiting for a break like
this, you screw it up in a night.

It's what the wall
was all about?

Jesus, Tepp.

And Quigley, you smashed his head
'cause he's a threat to you?

Did you listen to a word
he said all night?

He's got a wife
and kids, man.

We know where he lives.
You don't have to hurt a guy like that.

Now...

you know, now,
it's a problem.

Avery.

You're a problem.

Not if we split it.

Look, I'm a poor man today.

Tomorrow,
I'll be a millionaire.

Either way.

Just want a fair share.

You see, Quigley,
there's a man who's thinking.

He's living in the moment.
Half his head is freakin' gone,

and he's smarter than
all three of us put together.

Avery.

I don't want to threaten you.

I know what that feels like.

But if we do this,

and you turn on us...

I don't want anybody else hurt.

Right.

I got no problem with that.
I'm good with that too.

No.

We're not splitting it.

What?

10 minutes ago,

you were Johnny-split-it-all.

What are you, the Moral Majority now?
What, am I in the freakin' 700 Club?

We're splitting it, Tepp.

It's his.

It was his to begin with.

No, Tepp.
You found the wallet.

That ticket became yours,
and then you bet it in a game.

We're splitting it.
We're splitting it, Tepper.

And you damn well ought to be happy
about it, seeing as how you cheated me.

Don't complicate this,
Tepper, please.

Just don't complicate it.
This is the best way to do it.

We've all got something
on each other.

No one's going to talk,
it would only hurt us all.

I'm going to take the ticket,
I'll cash it out, I'll divvy it up.

See, I can handle that.

We're not splitting it.

It's his and
he's leaving with it.

No, what is this?
What is this, Tepper, huh?

Come on. This is about...
you feel guilty, Tepp?

'Cause if you feel guilty,
give us the ticket.

Give us the ticket, Tepp.

I'm doing this 'cause
it needs doing.

Take your ticket,
Avery.

I appreciate
the gesture, but...

it just doesn't seem
decided yet.

It's not that simple, is it?


Campbell: Guess who?

Tick, tick.
Open the door.


I was two blocks away
from getting clocked out.

I should have run the light.

What did I tell you, Tepp?
Officer, I'm sorry.

This is a little embarrassing.
I'm the one who called, actually.

L... I panicked.

What happened to you?

Like he said.
He panicked.

We were rough-housing and

I took a header,
and the little shit panics.

Yeah, I thought he was hurt.
He just panicked.

So he said.

I've grown tired of you guys.

I'm the one who called 911.

Well, I'm all out of gold stars.
Work it out with your buddies.

Well, that's 'cause I've done
something illegal.

And I want to confess.

I'm sorry, Fish.

You wise guys...

I'm finishing
a double shift

at the end of
a very long week.

I've got daughters home from school
waiting to spend time with their dad.

You are cutting into my quality time
and I do not appreciate it.

This ticket...

belongs to Avery.

Not me.

And not us.

Well then, I suggest
you give it to him.

The problem is,

it's a winner.

It's worth $6 million.

If I give this to you,

will you see that Avery
gets home safely with it?

Courtesy, professionalism
and respect.

That's me.

Nice.

This your ticket?

Yes, sir.

Does that mean
it's stolen property?

Look, I just want
what's fair.

There's no problem.

Oh, but there is a problem.

See, I wanted
to get out of here.

I wanted you guys to settle
this thing on your own,

on account
I've got family at home.

But like a boil on my ass,

you guys just
wouldn't go away.

So, whether you want
to press charges or not,

I have all the paperwork to do.
Procedure, I'm sure you know about that.

I'll do it Monday morning.

You'll find it in lost property
with your name on it, Avery.

Yeah, and I'm 10 inches.

Are you bragging,

or are you
doubting my word?

Yeah, just another
dirty cop, huh?

Maybe you're right.

Paperwork does have a way
of getting misplaced.

You girls have
a nice night.

Tepper,

please tell me you just
pulled a fast one.

And we're about
to work this out

like men.

Right?

You didn't just give
a New York City cop

a six million dollar
lottery ticket, right?

Right?

I did the right thing, Fish.

You did.

Oh, for crying out loud.

You did.

Congratulations, Tepp.

You just got code.

I just wish it could
have been tomorrow.

Nice knowing you, Avery.

Call her.

I appreciate what
you tried to do.

You did the right thing.

What?

Oh-h!

Son of a...

There's no mistaking
my ticket, is there?

Son of it!

Go home to your wife,
okay, Avery?

What's this?

Hey, oh!

Oh, God.

CD:
This is big brother Bolan

Hey, it's Carla.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

Hey, it's me.

I love you.

And I hope it's not
too little too late.

I love you.


How you doing?

I'm Avery Phillips.
