Is it popping yet?

Yeah!
All right.

By the way, I got a line on that
apartment I told you about.

It's beautiful, man. You
should check it out.

Where is it at?
On Ninth Street, between B and C.

Carlos, can I see you a minute?

I've been going
over your drawings.

What do you think?
Good.

They remind me a little
of Tommy Cashman.

Tommy Cashman? Holy fuck. That
dude draws some slick shit.

How long have you been
working on these?

About a year. Can you show these
to your friend at Gotham Comics?

I can... but I'm not going to.

But you just said they were good.

So is 'The Hulk,' but I
don't have to like it.

Your drawings are
technically fine,

but it just shows that you can copy
well, and they've got no soul.

I've known you for two years,

we've had a hundred
conversations... about comics.

You are a passionate
dude with deep ideas,

so I'm looking at this and thinking,
'Is this all you've got to say?'

Aliens from Jupiter want to
enslave the women of the Earth?

Yep!

You dumb motherfucker.

Cans go in the blue,
green is for paper.

What's going on?
I ain't touching those hands.

How did it go this morning?

David totally dug my shit, man.

He might send something
over to Gotham Comics.

That's excellent.

Check it out. It's the
Brunswick Monster.

How much did you pay for that?
What does it matter?

I predict this ball is gonna
add 15 points to my game.

Now all I got to do
is get to Vegas.

Vegas?

The Amateur World Classic is next
month, it costs 3,000 to enter,

but get this... the purse
is a hundred grand.

I don't know,
Mick... three grand?

Gracias, mi amor.

Hey, mi amor!

When you're finished playing with
the kids, come play with me.

Where is the car?

I got a guy tuning
her up in Yonkers.

Going out to the
track next weekend.

I'm ready for Le Mans.

You ready to come with
me? Take a chance?

I can't leave the kid by himself.
Excuses, excuses.

You're just fooling around
with that register.

I have to pay you back, right?
That's right.

Good morning!

The light, Mag. I'm
trying to finish this.

Good morning to you, too.
Hey, hey, muñeca.

Buen día.

What is it with
these space chicks

and the hugest tetas I've
ever seen in my life?

What happened to the eggs?

The eggs I asked you to bring
home last night? Those eggs?

I guess they're at the bodega.
I guess so.

Why don't we go out for breakfast?
We haven't done that in a month.

I've got to work.
I thought you were hungry.

I am, but-- hey, why
don't you get the eggs?

I've got to pick up
beads for the dress.

You can't do me a favor?

I got that part for
your sewing machine.

So? You said you were
gonna do that for a month.

And then, you finally did
it. Ha ha. Big favor.

See you later.
Hey, Mag, wait.

Maggie, wait. I don't want you
to leave like this, all angry.

I'm not angry, I just want
to know what's up with you.

It's just that I...

I don't know what I'm
doing with my drawings.

David said some shit,
yesterday... you know what, babe?

You know what? I'll
get the eggs, okay?

Okay?
Really?

Yeah.

I'll scramble them real
nice, like you like them...

with spinach in
them... mm-mmm.

Okay?
Okay.

I'll even get the beads.

Benny Moré?

Sí.

No hay problema.

Viejo, you know she ain't
gonna pay you, right?

What do you care? I mean
she's been coming in here

for 12 years.

If you divide 98 by 12,

it makes $8 a year
for her loyalty.

Then throw in Señora Rodríguez,
Señora Salcedo, Señora García...

Son, we have to have the
sense of the community.

That's very important.

Tito understands that, right?
Claro.

Tito understands everything.

You're a day late!

Hey, Miss Mercedes.
Miss Mercedes!

I need you at the other building.

Can I clean up first?
Later.

What's the fucking rush?

I told you we have to get these
windows in by the end of the month.

Why are these cans in
with the newspapers?

Didn't we have this
conversation before?

I posted notices on every floor.
That's not enough.

At the end of the day, you're
responsible, not the tenant.

My man! What's
happening?

Maggie, my buddy Mickey.
What's up?

Mickey... and Daisy.
Fuck you...!

Daisy, what's happening?

This is Berna. She
draws comics, too.

Hi, it's called
'Little Coffin Annie.'

It's Victorian
necrophilia pornography.

I've got to go to the girls' room.
I'll come with you.

Where do we go?
Negotiating hostages in there?

Fuck it. I ain't waiting
in this line, come on.

We have to wait.
I ain't waiting. I've got to pee.

You're not gonna pee in the sink?
No?

Oh, God. You're so crazy.
I've got to pee.

That's what Mickey says.

You know, people are
fucking weird here, okay?

Did I tell you I got
a callback at Gotham?

That's great!
They're interested in my strip.

That's good for you, man.

He's got this comic where this guy
gets shrunk to the size of an atom.

It's a quark, man.

It's a quark. A
subatomic particle.

How's your thing going? You
were gonna show it to David.

Oh... he likes it a lot.

Yeah?
What's it about?

I'm kind of reworking it.
It's fucking awesome.

Mickey! You haven't
seen it yet, dude.

You told me about it.

Did you check out that
apartment I told you about?

Yeah man, it's the shit. Maggie,
you got to see this place,

it's a railroad flat on
Ninth Street and Avenue C.

Ninth Street?
Yeah, baby, it's great.

I'm not moving down there.

It's already rented out.
I don't care if it's rented out.

I felt like a little
pendejita sitting there.

I asked Danny 'cause it was an
idea, and he looked into it.

You even went to go see it.

It was beautiful, a gorgeous
place with a lot of sunlight.

I felt like I could breathe
for once in my life.

Really? Well, maybe you should
go breathe by yourself.

I can't be without
you. Don't you get it?

No, I don't, because you
don't talk to me anymore.

I don't know what you're doing.
I was thinking about both of us.

You sewing in the back and
me drawing in the front,

like we dreamed. Like
we talked about.

We've been here
our whole lives.

Our whole fucking lives.

Okay, good night.
Good night.

Show me the safe.

I take the money every afternoon...
Show me the safe or I'll shoot.

I don't have a safe.
Show me the safe!

Don't shoot me, because it's
gonna be worse for you.

Show me the fucking safe!
The rest of your fucking life...

See here?

The bullet shattered your
father's vertebrae right there.

It severed the spinal
cord. And my guess...

is that the gun was
fired at close range.

He's lucky to be alive.
So...?

He'll never walk again. He's
paralyzed from the waist down.

Viejo?

Viejo?

Soy yo. Soy
yo, Carlos.

When you're working
in a bodega,

there's this unwritten rule that
when some crazy motherfucker

walks into the store to rob you,
you treat him like he's king,

like he has God-given permission
to own that fucking bodega.

You chill and you smile and
you hand him the money,

then you throw in a pack of Camels,
for the road, on the house.

What are you saying?
I'll bet you that the old man...

talked trash with the
asshole who shot him.

Baby, that guy was a nutcase!
He never saw the safe, babe.

Okay.

The police said the
safe was locked.

The old man held out
on the fucking guy.

As plain as day.

Carlos, you want
another helping?

Carlos?

Carlos?

You want more ham?
Oh no, I'm fine. Thank you.

See you in a couple of days.

Mickey, wait.

Carlos, there's someone I
want you to see. Let's go.

Come on, help
me clean up.

Six months ago he came to
me and asked for a loan,

to stay afloat.

He shouldn't have been
in that position.

I shouldn't have
given it to him.

The thing is, this
is not a small loan,

25 grand.

Yeah.

Come on.

There's a bodega on every
corner of the Heights, Carlos.

What makes Eddie's profitable?

Eddie!

Why is Eddie in
debt? Eddie.

If he sells the place,
I get my money back,

and I'm not forced to
have this conversation.

We both know he
ain't gonna sell it.

We both know he ain't gonna be able
to work it for quite some time...

if ever!

The way I see out of
this, for all of us...

is you take over.

The bodega, it's
a cash cow.

You're his kin.

People would keep coming in,

'cause they associate
you with your old man.

Maybe you should hang
with las viejas on 190th.

Why are you looking
at me like that?

Doctor says you're
getting out of here soon.

They set you up with a daytime
nurse for a couple of months.

I spoke to the insurance lady.

I put a little extra in to get
you through the next few weeks.

Gracias.
You've got a real gift, Carlos.

Don't let go of that.

Put me down, carajo!
I got you.

Put me down, coño!
I got you.

Nice! Let's get
some light in here.

Better, right?

You have some nice plants here,
Mr. Eddie. Let me knot it for you.

They could use some water.

Let's take this jug.

Turn it, dude. You're
gonna break the window.

Stop fucking bitching.
What did I tell you?

You'll hit the walls.
Shit. It's fucking heavy.

Why don't you leave it here?
You'll be back in two weeks.

Don't you dare, I'll
beat your ass up.

All right, Mr. Eddie...
I will see you mañana.

Yes? Around 7:00?

You forgot the Yankees
cup at the hospital,

so bring it back, tomorrow.

I forgot your Yankees cup?
Yes, you did. Bring it tomorrow.

All right, you two have
a good night. Take care.

See you later.
I like her.

Carlos?

Carlos!

What's up?

I shit myself.
What?

I said, I shit myself.

Throw that shit
away. He ain't dead.

Hey, hey, hey!
Hey kids, kids!

Kids, take it outside
with the water.

Take it outside with
the water! Hello?

Go. Hey, take it
outside with the water.

'Regular.'
Okay, 'Regular.'

Ay, no. Dame
'Lights.'

'Lights.'

You still need 30¢.

I'll pay you back.
Ah, señora, sorry.

No more loans.
But Eddie said...

Forget Eddie, doña. No
money. No loans. Entiende?

Have a good day!

Why don't you clean up
the back or something?

Okay, 'Boss'!

Ay, coño!

She's crazy!
Let's take him back up, guys.

You see, she's
speaking in tongues!

Cuidado, coño! Cuidado,
carajo! Let's go!

Anybody listening to me?
Let's go. To the left.

That's it. Yeah!

You did a good job on
the building, son.

You know the tournament?

You know the bowling
tournament in Vegas?

Not that again.

It's an investment.

No. It's not an investment,
it's a $5,000 vacation.

It's for the tournament.
It costs 3,000 to enter,

I've got to have some
money to fly out there...

for food and a hotel.

It's not like on five Gs I'm
gonna be able to get fancy.

You know, this bowling
thing of yours...

it's making you
look like a sucker.

What kills me is... there's no one
even trying to talk you into it.

It's just you.

Excuse me, excuse me.

Look, here. Somebody take your
boy... take your son and gone.

Take your father and him gone.
What?!

What happened?
Some boys took your father...

and I don't know
where he went.

Coño! Tito, take care of the
register, I'll be right back.

It's not my fault. I
don't know where he is.

'Santa María, Madre de Dios...

ruega por nosotros,
pecadores...'

You're funny.

I swear you think about Mom more
now than when she was alive.

She understands.

That's what you're looking
for? Understanding?

Tell it to someone else,
'cause she ain't listening.

She is listening,
believe me.

She's listening.

Mamá...

Eddie is still fucking every
woman he can get his hands on,

except now, he has given
them all his money too.

You used to sing
that song to Mamá.

Carlos, put me to bed.

I think it looks cute.
Red...

red, red...
Looks kind of cute, right?

I think so.
Oh my God!

There!
You look like an angel.

That looks pretty good, right?
Yeah.

As long as I don't eat a piece of
food for a month, I'll be fine.

Yeah, I thought you said
you wore a size six.

She was a size six. Like
12 years ago, right?

Hey... yo, that ain't funny. Shit.
I'm sorry.

Don't be like that. You
know you look gorgeous.

You do, you're beautiful.

Hey, Carlos.
Hi, baby!

I said, uh!

The bitch is four feet tall. And
her man is supposed to have...

Here you go.
...a 10-inch dick!

Baby?

You're sure?
No.

Do you want some
of this, Carlos?

No. I'm not into that shit.

What are you into?

Are you sure?

I'm out of here.
Carlos? Where are you going?

Out.
But...

Carlos, wait!
What's up with you?

I'll catch you
tomorrow, all right?

If you told me a month ago

I'd be running my pop's bodega,
I'd say you were smoking crack.

If you had told me when
we were in high school

that I'd be the super
of our building...

I'd told you that you were having
some kind of psychotic episode.

That shit is not even funny, man.

And you know what
the thing of it is?

What?
I'm a pretty good super.

Don't take this the wrong way,
but it ain't that hard, man.

It can be hard,
you dumb fuck!

You've got to have all sorts of
different management skills,

you've got to know how to deal with
all sorts of different people,

you got to know your
accounting, and I recycle.

Don't forget:
'Always recycle.'

'Blue goes with cans.
Green goes with paper.'

Don't mix it with the fucking
plastic. Don't forget.

Oh, shit!
My ball!

Come here.
Oh, thank you.

Oh, you stupid fucker!

On weekends,

me and Daisy got this thing,
where she calls me...

to fix stuff in her apartment,

and I go up, and
we have sex.

I mean, if her mother's
not home, you know?

But, who else gets paid to fuck?
Ho's.

People, watch my shit.

Everybody on the floor!

Hey, bruja!

You better not be drinking
out of the bottle,

you know how
Carlos hates that.

Carlos? That
nigga ain't here.

Which one of your hooker
friends is this one for?

You should let me know, so I
could roll up and fuck her.

Sometimes I wonder how we come
from the same two people.

Get the fuck outta here. We both
got a talent for merchandising.

Merchandising? Is that what
you're calling it? Merchandising?

Why don't you let a
nigga set you up?

Set you up with a little shop.
We can keep all your shit there.

Because I can take care of all
my shit right here in my house.

It's all right, hermanita.

One day, I'm gonna
open you up a store,

when you come back
with me to the D.R.,

en la Calle del Sol,

we could call it 'Maggie's.'

Yeah? Give it to Darlene.

Are you trippin'?

You know Carlos ain't gonna
take care of your ass.

Like everybody else in
this motherfucker...

out for himself.

You know what, hermanito?

Why don't you support your
kids... y déjame de joder?

I was looking out for
my little sister.

This place is starting
to look like a dump.

Why don't you take some boxes away?
Okay, boss.

Don't call me that.

Where do you guys
get this from?

It's beautiful.

You know that can of paint
up front, the white one?

Yes.

Why don't you go get it
and paint over that shit?

Everybody gonna like this.

It gives some cultural
stuff to the store

and the kids love that.

I drew that.
Eight years ago.

My mom used to watch
me every afternoon.

Altogether, it took
about... a month.

Why you want to
take it down?

'Cause it's bullshit.
It's beautiful.

You said your mom liked
it, I'm sure your dad...

Why don't you cover that shit?

You put a part of yourself
into the store...

What are you...?

I did that shit for my father,

he covered that shit and
now you want to uncover it?

When I come back, this
shit better be gone.

Stop!

Yo! Ten cuidado, coño.
Watch where you're going.

Right, right. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, chau.

Hey.
Hey.

What's up, Carlos?

He's coming along.
Yeah?

Yeah.

Oye, those are selling fantastic, bro'!

Good.
You want it?

I'll take those.
Okay.

Carlos, are you still here?

I got to be downtown.

No, you've got to be at Hunt's Point
at 9:00 in the morning, Carlos.

I can't go, viejo.
You have to go.

Take! We're still sharing the
truck with Pancho en la 173.

Viejo, I can't go.
You have to go, Carlos.

You can ruin your life
with your muñequita,

but you're not gonna
ruin my bodega!

You have to go, take the keys.

So I worked on a new
color for this guy.

That's a great color.

I've got to show you something.

I just finished these panels,

I wanted to know
what you thought.

Jenny, go work on this.
We'll talk about this, okay?

You all right?
How you've been?

Hey, Carlos? How
have you been?

You all right?
I'm fine. Fine.

All right, what
do you got here?

So, what do you think?

It's good!

Good. Good.

I based that one on the old man.
How is he?

He's fine.
Listen...

can you show these to your
friend at Gotham Comics?

Who, Raquel?

Yeah.
Are you sure you're ready?

'Cause you only get one chance
with her, you know that.

These are good.

...which I assume is how
you got the idea for this.

They're based on the Dominicans
who fought for La Independencia.

Los Gavilleros?
Yeah.

They fought the US with a
guerilla waftare for four years.

For me, it's just another
way of talking about sugar.

That's what the Gavilleros
were fighting over...

foreign companies buying property
from people who don't even own it,

then kicking the
campesinos off their land.

Anyway, that's how I got
the concept for 'Europa.'

Carlos...

I've got to be honest with you.

I really like what you did.

Really?
I love it!

And it couldn't come in
a more peftect time,

because I just lost a series.
The artist was brilliant,

but he was terribly depressed
and he could never work.

And I had to find something to
fill the book in our slate.

Okay!
Great! How soon can you finish?

You never gonna believe it.
What?

You've got to guess.
I don't know. You won the lotto?

I asked Daisy to marry me.
Get the fuck outta here!

I asked her to marry
me and she said yes.

I am high as a
motheftucker right now.

Dude, do you know
what you're doing?

Of course I know. I know
I say shit sometimes,

but that's just me being stupid.
I'm getting fucking married, bro'.

All right then, well,
shit! We should celebrate.

I have no champagne, so here...

this will have to do.

Here you go.
Drink away, man!

When is the big day?

All right. You know
that I like...

there's this bowling tournament
in Las Vegas, I wanted to go to,

so I figure...

I'll just take care of
everything at once.

Like, I got a thousand
dollars saved up already,

all I need is like...

4,000 more dollars.

Please, don't ask
me for money, bro'.

Not from you, from the store.
I can't do it, man.

You told me the other day how
much you're taking in a week.

You don't understand.
I'll pay you back.

It's not that.
Then, what?

There's some shit you don't know.
What? What I don't know?

Right now, for all
intents and purposes,

your father owns la bodega.

Get the fuck out of here!
Mickey, I ain't fucking around.

Why do you think I
took over the store?

You think I want to run this?
No, but your papá...

Yo, listen man. Your father
told me I had no choice,

Eddie's into him for
25 fucking grand.

How is he gonna give
your father 25 grand,

and he's not gonna give me
nothing? What the fuck!

Look, chill, man.

Here... it's not much... a couple
of hundred. Why don't you take?

Take it.
It's okay.

It's okay, man.
I'll figure it out.

Mickey!

Remember when you were talking
about moving downtown?

Um-hmm.
Maybe we should do that.

Say what?
I mean, after Eddie gets better...

and things straighten out with Sean.
That could take some time.

We're like a team, right?
Yeah.

Like Paul and Belkis.

Yeah.

Yeah. About me?

What, Darlene? You learned
that word yesterday?

Fuck you, Darlene,
all right?

What's up, Angel?
Pon la luz aquí también.

Deja la luz.
This bitch, bro'.

Trying to convince me she
wasn't with some other nigga...

Can't this wait until later?
No, it can't wait!

That bitch is trying to
take money out of my fist.

That's it!
Out. Get out!

Wait. Darlene's busting
you for child's support?

She's trying to tell me this
Chinese-eyed motherfucker is my kid.

That's bullshit!
Un plato, and that's it.

Shitty day, man.

How is your kid in
Santo Domingo doing?

What, Junior?
My real kid?

Good, man. I can't
wait. Save my money,

soon as I get my 60 Gs,
getting the fuck outta here.

Go back to the D.R., live
with him and Carmen.

I'm gonna open
me a bike shop.

Stay with my tío in Baitoa,

just till I get hooked up.

He got a farm, and when
you're done working all day,

you go lay on this
hammock, next to the pond.

You just lay there, bro'. You
let the breeze hit your face.

You're chillin' with
your boxers off,

and the wind kissing
your balls...

Darlene is only asking
for 600 a month.

Guess how much she's
getting? Zero dollars.

The thing of it is,
that bitch rats me out,

I'm as good as
back in lockup.

That's why I don't
trust nobody.

That's why I don't get
no mail at my house,

I ain't got money in no bank.
He's got over 40 grand hidden.

Maggie, what the fuck?!
Why don't you give Carlos money?

¿Tú estás loca?
As a loan to get back the bodega.

Maggie!
This could be a way out of here.

You heard what he said,
he needs that money.

You were gonna give me that
money to open my own space.

Shut the fuck up,
you're family.

Carlos isn't family?
He'll pay you back.

It's my business, I can
take care of it, okay?

People buggin' out around
me today. Later, bro'.

You got a big fucking mouth,
and I ain't got no money.

Where did you put them?
Where'd you put them?

I'm tired of your fucking
bullshit game, viejo.

Where are my fucking drawings?

Carlos...

I should be the one

that would be making
the questions here.

How many gallons of milk
did you deliver today?

How many cases of
aguacate? Yuca?

Plátanos? Café?
I don't fucking know.

That's what you should
be worrying about.

Where are my drawings, man?

Maybe I burned them.

Maybe I threw them
in the Hudson.

Maybe I broke them
in pieces like this.

What are you gonna
do about it, huh?

What are you going
to do about it?

You're wasting your time, Carlos.

The gringos are not going to
print your fucking drawings!

I want you to tell
me what you see.

I can't see, Carlos. I
don't have my glasses.

You can see. You don't want
to see. Tell me what you see!

What else?

He has a kind of a uniform on.

What else can you tell
me about this drawing?

Look at the details.
Look, look!

What can you tell me
about this drawing?

The details, what can you tell me?

That's it?
Yeah. What else... ?

You have nothing else to say?
What else do you want me to say?

I want you to look at this drawing
and tell me that you like it.

Tell me that you like it, Pa.

Your mother liked them.
Isn't that enough for you?

Where the fuck do you get
off bringing up Mamá?

Your name and hers don't belong
in the fucking same sentence.

Fuck you! She
was my wife.

She was your mother, okay?

Then why the fuck did you
fuck everybody on the corner?

And when we own a fucking
bodega, doing the fucking girls!

She forgave me.
You fucking animal!

You fucking cocksucker!
She knew me.

For me, your mother was
everything, you motherfucker!

For me, your mother was God.
She was everything for me.

I loved her, and
I still love her.

And she forgave
me, all the time.

She forgave me all the time.

Your drawings are...

inside the closet.

Very nice.

This is gorgeous! It's
gorgeous. Listen...

my boss gave me the authority...

to cut a check if this
met with my approval.

Holy... Raq, yeah!

It's gonna be a few weeks
before you get it, so...

A toast to Carlito!

It's all thanks to this man.

You did the work.
You inspired me.

Well, it's not much,
but it's home.

It's nice.

We broke up a month ago.

That's cool.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Viejo...

when did Mamá first know
you were cheating on her?

Since the beginning.

I tried to play
the wise guy,

and say that I had
to go to the bodega,

or go downtown...

but she always knew.

From the peftume. And
you know what I did?

I bought a bottle of 'Colonia 1800'...

de Crusellas, la colonia cubana
to cover this... the peftume...

and she knew.

She always knew.

Are you cheating on Maggie?
No.

Is she beautiful?
Yeah.

No.

Hey, what would you do?

What would I do?

You know what I'd do.

But it doesn't mean that
that's what you have to do,

but that's what I'd do.

Super!

Super!

What the...?

Oh, shit...

You look beautiful!

Check the ring!

Your creation!
Thank you!

Do you think they got
merengue bands in Vegas?

Are you going?

Good luck, mamá.
Stay warm.

Okay.
See you later.

So, what did you think
of Belkis' dress?

It was nice.
Real nice.

How come you didn't
dance with me?

I don't know. I
wasn't in the mood.

I don't know.

Look, Maggie, maybe
this whole thing...

something is off.

I feel like I'm not
connecting with you lately.

Well, finally I get an
honest statement from you.

Ever since I was eight years old,
all I wanted to do was draw comics.

That's it! If you understand
that, you would support me, babe.

Support you? What are you
talking about, 'support' you?

What about supporting me, huh?

You think just because
you're some kind of artist,

you're better than everybody else?
Well, you're not an artist, okay?

You're just somebody whose
father owns a bodega.

Sean?

Señora Rodríguez?
Hello, Doña Marquez?

Martín? Hi, it's
Carlos. Hello?

I'm having a get-together
for my father tonight.

Can you bring some sopita
that you made last time?

He really likes that.

Beautiful!

Hello?

Hey, Mickey.
What's up, man?

Okay.

Sure. I'll
be there.

What's up? What's
the hurry?

Open it!

Where did you get this?

It doesn't matter. Now you
can pay back my father.

Please, tell me you didn't
take this from Angel.

I know you've been
working over there.

Please tell me you didn't
take this from Angel.

He had it hidden in some
records. I only took 30 Gs.

There was more. You
wouldn't believe it.

Stupid fuck, man!

Me and Daisy, we're moving to
Vegas. She's meeting me in an hour.

You're not using your brain.
Angel needs that money.

He finds out you took
it, he's gonna kill you.

He ain't gonna do
shit, all right?

Mickey, there's niggas in Baitoa
who'll kill you for a bean pie, man.

This ain't the island, man. He's
practically a brother-in-law.

He'd probably give it to you himself.

Actually, he wouldn't.

Just take it, all right?

I'm getting paid, man.
For 'Europa,' my comic.

I'll have the money, and
I'll pay back your father.

You couldn't use another
$25 Gs? Come on, man.

After you pay back my dad,
what are you gonna live on?

How are you gonna find
time to draw another one?

I'll go back to
Azteca, okay?

Fuck!

Don't tell me I did
this for nothing.

I did this for you, man. I
can't take this back now.

You don't realize, this is the best
thing that could happen to us.

My father, he thinks we're all about
the Heights, but he's fucked up.

He don't realize we're
better than this.

You don't think he'd rather
be at the track all day,

than busting his ass up
here in some building?

This is our chance, man.

Mickey? Open the door!
Oh, fuck!

The bag, the
bag. All right!

Mickey!
All right. One sec!

What's going on in here?

Nothing.
Why aren't you at the store?

I asked him to help me bring
down the oven from 4C.

Am I supposed to put every
single window in myself?

You should get back to
the store. Come on.

I've got to use the can.

Jesus H. Christ! You're
slower than your mother.

We'll see you later.
Okay.

Lock up after me.

Tell Daisy I'll meet her
at the store in an hour.

Angel?

What are you doing here?

I used to live here.
What are you doing here?

I had to return
something I borrowed.

I've got to go.

'And Mickey Kilpatrick...

throws a final strike
for a peftect game,

and the tournament!'

I'm just being stupid.

Did you ever really bowl one?

What? A perfect game?
Yeah.

Three times.

Really?

Oh, Juanito!

I wanna see my kingdom here.

Good work, son.

What the fuck?

What the fuck!

Where is the other five?
What?

Don't fuck around with
me. Where's my five Gs?

I don't know.
Oyeme!

Where the fuck is my money?
I don't know Angel, stop it.

You gave it to him?
No!

I fucking trusted you, you fucker!

Hey... hello, hello! Can I
get your attention, please?

Cállense!
I wanna make a quick toast.

Where's Mickey?
He's coming, relax.

I took care of everything.
I wanna make a quick toast.

Today... today's a happy day.
My pop is getting better.

Doctor says if he
keeps making progress,

he'll be back to work
in a few months.

You know, it
hasn't been easy,

but we nearly killed each
other a couple of times.

But, we're here.
We're here!

It's his day. So,
un toast to Eddie.

Hi, how are
you? Surprised?

I wanna thank everybody for
staying loyal to la bodega.

Come on, you make it sound
like you're leaving.

Sí, me voy.

As a matter of fact, it
is my last week here.

I sold some of my drawings.

I got this company
publishing my comics, man.

Can you believe that?
Oh, Carlos!

Yeah, yeah. I want to ask
Tito to take over the bodega

until the old man can
come back full time.

Está bien.
Yeah.

I took the money back. You
have nothing to worry about.

Did Angel see you?
No, it's all good, man.

No, it ain't all good. I
kept five grand for myself.

Aw, fuck! Fuck!

How do you think I got plane tickets
and the fee for the tournament?

I had to wire that this morning.
We've got to get you outta here.

We gotta go.
We gotta go.

Give me my fucking money!

Chill, chill!
Do you think I'm stupid?

I took it!

Stop it!

You stupid! Where the fuck is
my money? Stupid motherfucker!

Where's my money? You already
spent my fucking money!

I don't want to see
you again here.

Get the fuck out of here!

This ain't over
between you and me.

No! Mickey!

You saw him rush me.

He rushed me. What
was I gonna do?

Maggie, llama a una ambulancia, ve
a buscar una ambulancia, por favor.

Please.

Mickey, don't go.
¿ Tú me oyes papi?

Mickey? Mickey,
stay with me.

You know, when I
first came here,

I thought that was America?

Then I found out it
was only New Jersey.

Immigrants are some
ignorant motherfuckers, eh?

Juanito?
Sí?

I'm closing shop.

What are you drawing?
It's a new strip.

More Azucareros?
Nah.

This shit's for real.
