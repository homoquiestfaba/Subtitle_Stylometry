GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE!

GOOD MORNING.
MORNING.

I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL
HEREON THIS GLORIOUS DAY.

WE'VE ALL COME TOGETHER
ONE AND ALL

TO GIVE PRAISE TO
OUR LORD JESUS.

AMEN.

AMEN.

BEFORE I GET STARTED
WITH TODAY'S MESSAGE,

I'D, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ALL
A LITTLE STORY.

A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TRAVELING

WITH A VERY CLOSE FRIEND
OF MINE, A FELLOW PASTOR.

WE WERE DRIVING TO
A CHURCH CONFERENCE

AND WE HAD BEEN IN THE CAR
FOR QUITE A FEW HOURS

CHATTING ABOUT THIS AND THAT,
OLD TIMES,

AND IN GENERAL, PASSING THE TIME

AS THE ROAD AND TELEPHONE
POLES PASSED US BY.

BUT THEN THE TOPIC CHANGED,
I MEAN, HEY,

YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO PASTORSIN
A CAR FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME

WITHOUT THE TOPIC TURNING
TO OUR LORD.


THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO
A DISCUSSION OF REVERENCE,

SPECIFICALLY REVERENCE
OF OUR LORD

AND REVERENCE OF HIS HOLY NAME.

AND OUT OF THAT SPRUNG A
STORYMY FRIEND THE PASTOR TOLD ME...

ABOUT A TROUBLED YOUNG MAN,

A BOY REALLY,
16 OR 17 YEARS OLD.

A BOY THAT HAD BEEN MOVED FROM
FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME.

HE DIDN'T HAVE A SENSE OF PLACE.

DIFFERENT HOUSE, DIFFERENT
FAMILY, DIFFERENT FACES.

A BOY WHO, THROUGH CIRCUMSTANCE,
HAD BEEN LEFT ON HIS OWN,

ALL ALONE, TO FEND FOR HIMSELF
IN THIS WORLD.

HE JUST NEEDED A CHANCE.

HE REALLY JUST NEEDED
A FRESH START.

HE'S A BOY WHO MERELY NEEDED
SOMEONE TO CARE.

THESE PEOPLE, THEY'RE PART
OF MY CHURCH.

I FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM,
AS I DO YOU.

I'VE READ YOUR FILE
AND SPOKEN WITH YOU

AND ALL I REALLY KNOW FOR SURE
IS HOW TOUGH YOUR LIFE'S BEEN.

BUT THAT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE,
SON, IN HERE.

YOU WILL DECIDE THAT.

SO TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU WANT
OUT OF LIFE?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE?

SAY WHATEVER COMES TO MIND.

OKAY.

MONEY, ENOUGH SO I DON'T HAVE
TO DEPEND ON ANYONE.

OH, I GOT YA ON THAT ONE.

ME TOO.

BUT THAT'S THE EASY ONE.

BESIDES MONEY.

YOU'D BETTER SPEAK UP.

YOU RAN OUT OF OPTIONS LONG AGO.

LISTEN, SON.

YOU SEE, I'VE GOT A WHOLE GROUP

OF THESE OLD PRAYER WARRIOR
LADIES.

THEY'RE IN THE OTHER ROOM
KNITTING SHAWLS.

WELL, I'M THINKING THAT THEY'D
LIKE NOTHING MORE

THAN TO BE ASKED TO COME IN HERE

AND PRAY OVER A TROUBLED
YOUNG MAN.

YOU WOULDN'T.

IT'D MAKE THEIR WEEK.

MAYBE EVEN THEIR MONTH.

OKAY, I'D LIKE TO BE
ACCEPTED FOR ME.

NOT THE POOR KID WHO DOESN'T
HAVE A HOME.

I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE FEELING
PITY FOR ME.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I GOT IT.

AND I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HONESTY.

I MEAN, I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH
EITHER OF THOSE TWO AREAS

OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT, WELL,

'BLESSED IS THE MAN
WHO FEARS GOD,

WHO TAKES GREAT DELIGHT
IN HIS COMMANDS.'

THAT WOULD BE PSALM 112.

I THINK I'D RATHER LISTEN
TO THE PRAYER SHAWL LADIES.

YOU TAKING HIM
TO THE LEWIS' TONIGHT?

YES, LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

THEY'RE A NICE FAMILY, SON.

GO EASY ON THEM, OKAY?

OOH, I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THEM,
I'M SURE THEY'RE JUST LOVELY.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

THANK YOU FOR COMING.

IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I NEED
TO HANDLE SOMETHING.

YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO THEM,
RIGHT, PASTOR?

I WAS JUST GOING TO GRAB THEM.

LADIES, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

TOM, WHITNEY.

REVEREND.
HELLO.

I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH

FOR TAKING THIS YOUNG MAN
INTO YOUR HOME.

OF COURSE.
IT'S TRULY GOD'S WORK.

I WAS WONDERING IF I MIGHT
BEABLE TO SPEAK TO YOU IN PRIVATE,

IN MY OFFICE PERHAPS,
IF YOU HAVE A MINUTE.

SURE.
OF COURSE.

NATE, WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK
WITH REVEREND FIELDS

FOR A FEW MINUTES.

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'M COMING TOO.

IT'S OKAY.

NATE, WHY DON'T YOU SCOOT
OVER HERE WITH US?

NO. I'M OKAY RIGHT HERE.

UH, TOM, WHITNEY,
IT WAS ACTUALLY NATE

THAT REQUESTED THE MEETING.

HE, UH... IT'S ABOUT
THE FOSTER CHILD.

HE'S NOT A CHILD!
HE'S A 17 YEAR OLD.

NATE HAS SOME CONCERNS
WITH THE PLACEMENT.

YES, AND WE'VE ALREADY SPOKEN
TO HIM ABOUT IT.

IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE IGNORING
HIS CONCERNS,

IT'S JUST THAT, UM, WE FEEL
CALLED TO DO THIS.

THAT, THAT'S RIGHT.

WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS.

NATE SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT YOU INTO IT.

I'M BRINGING HIM INTO THISBECAUSE
HE BROUGHT THIS TO YOU.

AND SURELY WE CAN ALL SEE THIS

AS SOME SORT OF ATTEMPT
TO REPLACE JACK.

NATE! SHOW SOME RESPECT.

WHAT? HE WAS MY BROTHER!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

THE DECISION'S BEEN MADE.

HE'S COMING. THAT'S FINAL.

OKAY.

BEST WE PRAY ON THIS.

HOW 'BOUT WE READ FROM...

NATE.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I'LL TALK TO HIM.

NO, LET ME HANDLE THIS.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

THAT'S CUTE, BUT NOT HELPFUL.

HEY, WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE
UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS

BUT IT IS HAPPENING
AND IT WON'T BE FAIR TOO HIM

IF WE DON'T MAKE HIM
FEEL WELCOME.

LOOK, I'M SURE HE'S GOING
TO BE FEELING NERVOUS

AND TRYING HIS HARDEST
TO FIT IN.

HEY, WE LOVE YOU
AND WE LOVE JACK

AND NOTHING WILL EVER
CHANGE THAT, OKAY?

NOW WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE
AN EFFORT AND BE NICE?


THANKS, BUD.

PUSH YOUR HAIR BACK...
AND TRY TO SMILE.

YES, CAN I HELP YOU?

UH... I'M LOOKING
FOR MR. AND MRS. LEWIS?

OH, THEY LIVE NEXT DOOR.

WHAT'S HE DONE?

OH, NOTHING, MA'AM.

HE'S JUST A FOSTER PLACEMENT
WITH THE LEWIS'.

IS HE PART OF A GANG?

NO, MA'AM.

I LEFT THEM AND I'M
HOPING TO HIDE OUT HERE

SO THEY DON'T FIND ME.

HE'S GOT A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

WE'RE SORRY FOR THE MISTAKE,
MA'AM.

THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO START
LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME.

PLEASE TRY TO MAKE
THE MOST OF THIS.

HEY.

REVEREND FIELDS WORKED
REALLYHARD TO GET YOU THIS PLACEMENT.

THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

SO I HEAR.

YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACETHIS TIME?

[RINGS DOORBELL]

HI.

HELLO, MISS SWANSON,
AND THIS MUST BE MASON.

PLEASE, COME IN.

THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL HOME.
OH, THANK YOU.

YEAH, IT'S A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

NATE, THEY'RE HERE!

AND THERE'S LOTS OF KIDS
YOUR AGE AND LOTS TO DO, SO.

DO I REALLY HAVE TO BE HERE
FOR THIS?

YES.

[PATTING CUSHION]

THIS IS OUR SON, NATE.

HI, NATE! THIS IS MASON.

AND MASON, THIS IS NATE
AND MR. AND MRS. LEWIS.

NICE TO MEET YOU, MASON.

YOU TOO, CHIEF.
MASON.

IT'S MR. AND MRS. LEWIS.

YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

HE REALLY IS TRYING HARD
TO FIT IN HERE.

OH, OF COURSE, I AM.

IT'S BEEN MY DREAM
TO COME AND LIVE

WITH YOUR PERFECT LITTLE FAMILY.

I'M SO SORRY.

YOU KNOW TEENAGERS,
AND IT'S A ROUGH TRANSITION.

I CAN SPEAK WITH HIM
IF YOU'D LIKE.

WOULD YOU USE A CLUB?
NATE!

THIS IS GREAT...

WE JUST HAVE TO GET TO
KNOWEACH OTHER A LITTLE, THAT'S ALL.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

COME TO SEE THE NEWEST
ATTRACTION?

YOU'RE OUR FIRST.

IF THEY'RE ALL LIKE YOU,
I CAN'TSEE US GETTING ANY MORE.

WELL, ZOO'S CLOSED.

WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE
OUR DOORS CLOSED.

YEAH, WELL, I'M OLDER.
DIFFERENT RULES.

JACK WAS OLDER TOO.

HE FOLLOWED THE SAME RULES.

WHO'S JACK?

MY BROTHER.

THIS IS HIS ROOM.

WHERE'S HE, BESIDES
KEEPING AWAY FROM YOU?

HE'S IN HEAVEN NOW,
AND WE GOT ALONG JUST FINE.

YEAH, WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN HEAVEN.

[DOOR SHUTS]

WELL, WHERE IS HE?

DID YOU TELL HIM DINNER
WAS READY?

I TOLD HIM, BUT HIS DOOR
IS CLOSED,

SO WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S
DOING IN THERE.

NATE, WE HAVE TO LET HIM FIT IN,
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

WE HAVE TO EARN HIS TRUST
AND RESPECT

LIKE HE HAS TO FOR US.




EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY,
YOU GOTTA TO LET ME KNOW.

[RATTLING DOORKNOB]

MASON! OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW!

NICE CALL WITH THE DOOR.

THAT'S IT.

I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME
IN THERE, MASON.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

WHY DID YOU HAVE
THIS DOOR... LOCKED.

HE'S GONE.
WHAT?

WAIT, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

I'M GOING TO GO TRY TO FIND HIM.

SHOULDN'T WE CALL PASTOR FIELDSOR SWANSON?

NO, NO, LET ME, LET ME TRY
TO FIND HIM FIRST.

I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS
INTO A BIGGER DEAL

THAN IT ALREADY IS.

STAY HERE IN CASE
HE COMES BACK OR CALLS.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

THANK YOU.

[DOOR DINGS]

LEAVE YOUR BAG ON
THE COUNTER, PLEASE.


STORE POLICY.

YEAH, WELL, MY POLICY IS
TO KEEP IT WITH ME.

OKAY.

THANKS FOR STOPPING BY THEN.

YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS TO MAKE ME
LEAVE THIS BAG.

THIS IS DISCRIMINATION.

I HAVE TEENAGERS COMING IN
HEREAND STEALING ME BLIND.

IF YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM,
CONGRATULATIONS.

BUT YOU STILL GOTTA
TO LEAVE THE BAG.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I THOUGHT CHRISTIANS ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE TRUSTING.

'IN GOD I TRUST,
ALL OTHERS PAY CASH, '

AND LEAVE THEIR BAG UP HERE.

[EXHALES ANGRILY]

KIDDING ME.

I'M ABOUT TO CALL THE COPS.
FOR WHAT?

FOR NOT FOLLOWING STORE RULES.

FINE! HERE.

HMM.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

DON'T YOU WANT TO CHECK
MY POCKETS?

[REGISTER BEEPS]

WHAT IS THIS FOR?

SCHOOL PROJECT.

WHAT, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT TO BUY TOO?

[ZIPPERS BAG]

HERE'S YOUR CHANGE.
YOU WANT A BAG?

I GOT ONE.

[DOOR DINGS]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

GOOD EVENING. WHAT'S GOING ON?

A MALE TEENAGER BOUGHT
SPRAY PAINT FROM HER,

THEN VANDALIZED THE STORE.

UM, WHAT, UH, WHAT DID
HE LOOK LIKE?

AVERAGE BUILD, MAYBE 17.

CURLY DARK HAIR,
DARK BACKPACK, DARK CLOTHES.

THIS KID LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
GOING NOWHERE REAL FAST.

DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SIR?

HEY, HE JUST GOT BACK.

I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM
BUT HE WENT IN HIS ROOM.

I BET.

JUST GO EASY ON HIM.

WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING
TO BE CHALLENGING.

HE VANDALIZED
A CONVENIENCE STORE!

THE POLICE ARE THERE.

WHAT?

HEY.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

WHERE DID YOU GO?

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

MASON, WE'RE NOT STUPID.

OKAY, OKAY, I JUST NEEDED
SOME AIR, YOU KNOW.

I BORROWED A BIKE AND RODE IT
AROUND, BUT I BROUGHT IT BACK.

YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE,
ESPECIALLY THROUGH A WINDOW1

WE WANT THIS TO WORK,
WE WANT YOU HERE,

BUT YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR PART.

WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU.

HEY, NO ONE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR ME, BUT ME.

OH. SOUNDS TOUGH,
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

WHILE YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE,

YOU'LL RESPECT US AND
THE RULESOF THE HOUSE.

OR WHAT? YOU'LL KICK ME OUT?

BEEN THERE.

MASON, CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP?

I MEAN, WE'VE WELCOMED YOU
INTO OUR HOME.

WE FEEL CALLED TO HAVE YOU
AS PART OF THIS FAMILY.

A CALLING, HUH?

WELL, THEN IT HAS TO BE RIGHT.

"TO VISIT ORPHANS AND WIDOWS
IN THEIR AFFLICTION,

AND TO KEEP ONESELF UNSTAINED
FROM THE WORLD."

THAT'S FROM JAMES.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

GOD DOESN'T CARE
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU!

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DAD.

HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HEAVEN.

YEAH, FORGET THIS.

I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

GET BACK HERE YOUNG MAN.

WE STILL NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THE GRAFFITI!

TOM, JUST, JUST GIVE HIM
A MINUTE.

GOD, IT'S NATE, JACK'S BROTHER.


THAT I THINK ABOUT HIM
ALL THE TIME.

LORD, TELL HIM THAT
I MISS HIM SO BAD.

GOD, WHY IS IT THAT GOOD
PEOPLELIKE JACK GET TAKEN AWAY

AND THEN THE BAD ONES
LIKE MASON GET TO STAY?

WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE ONLY
GOOD PEOPLE GET TO GO TO HEAVEN?

ANYWAY, THANK YOU, GOD.

AMEN.

[CAR ENGINE]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I TELL YOU AGNES, THERE'S
SOMETHING HORRIBLE GOING ON

OVER AT THAT HOME.

HELLO, MISS SWANSON,
PLEASE COME IN.

HE'S IN HERE.

YOU GOT THIS?
I'M GONNA GO DEAL WITH NATE.

YEAH, YEAH.

HELLO, MASON.

WE NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK
ABOUT THE VANDALISM DONE

TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE
ON PLEASANT AVENUE LAST NIGHT.

DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

NO.

I WAS, I WAS HERE
ALL LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?

IT WAS MR. LEWIS WHO CALLED ME
AND REPORTED YOU

AS MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION
OF THE SUSPECT.

NICE.

GUESS YOU GOT A NEW CALLING?

THE STORE OWNER HAS ID'ED YOU
FROM A PHOTOGRAPH.

SHE'S GOING TO PRESS CHARGES.

YOUR FILE IS GOING
TO BE REVIEWED

AND A JUDGE WILL DECIDE
THE NEXT STEPS.

MR. LEWIS, THANK YOU
FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP.

I'LL JUST GRAB MY BAG.
I'LL BE READY IN FIVE.

AH, HOLD ON. STAY RIGHT THERE.

DON'T I HAVE TO GO WITH HER?

HERE THAT EASILY, MISTER.

NOTHING HAS CHANGED BETWEEN US.

YOU ARE STILL PART
OF THIS FAMILY.

WE'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS TOGETHER.

LET ME KNOW WHEN
HIS COURT DATE IS

AND WE'LL MAKE SURE HE IS THERE.

OKAY, AND IT SHOULD BE
IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

OKAY. GO AHEAD AND FINISH
YOUR BREAKFAST.

MISS SWANSON, I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

OH YEAH, AND BY THE WAY, YOUR
COURT-ORDERED GROUP MEETINGS

START AFTER SCHOOL TONIGHT.

YOU'RE ALL SIGNED UP.


[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

THAT'S FUNNY, AGNES.

I THOUGHT FOR SURE

THEY'D BE DRAGGING THAT
HOODLUMOFF IN HANDCUFFS.

IF THIS IS GONNA WORK AT ALL

WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEONE WHO
BELIEVES IS GONNA HAVE

AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
POINT OF VIEW

FROM SOMEONE WHO
DOES NOT BELIEVE.

YOU WITH ME?

HELLO LACEY, GLAD YOU
COULD JOIN US.

YOU WERE SAYING?

YEAH, I DON'T BELIEVE.

BIG SURPRISE.

AND YOU DO?

YEAH, BUT NOT IN SOME
GOOD GUY IN THE SKY.

MORE LIKE A PUPPET MASTER
LOOKING FOR LAUGHS.

READ THAT ON SOME T-SHIRT?

YOU HAVE A SMART MOUTH...

LOOKS LIKE THE NEW GUY'SGOT
A LITTLE BIT OF AN ATTITUDE.

RELAX, RELAX, RELAX.

WE'VE ALL GOT PROBLEMS
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

THERE'S NO ONE HERE TO JUDGE
WHO'S RIGHT AND WHO'S WRONG.

WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUTBETTER WAYS

TO DEAL WITH THOSE PROBLEMS.

TRY TO UNDERSTAND LIFE
A LITTLE BETTER.

AND HOPEFULLY, AS WE GO,
GET OVER OUR PREJUDICES.

[DOOR OPENS]

RUBY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

I SEE YOU'RE FAMILIAR

WITH THE NEWEST MEMBER
OF OUR GROUP, HUH?

MOM?
MMM HMM.

I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

MY FRIEND STEVE TO ME
YOU'RE TRYING TO COPE

WITH THE LOSS OF JACK BY
REPLACING HIM WITH MASON.

STEVE, THE 14 YEAR OLD
ON YOUR BASEBALL TEAM?

YEAH.

SOUNDS LIKE STEVE NEEDS TO
STOPWATCHING DAYTIME TALK SHOWS.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

HONEY LISTEN, LOSING JACK IS
JUST PART OF THIS.

WE REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN
HELP MASON.

BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT YOU.

YOU'RE OUR SON.

HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

HEY. WE'RE JUST, YOU KNOW,
JUST DOING DISHES.

WELL, HE'S AT THE GROUP.

HOPEFULLY WALLACE CAN HELP.

I HOPE HE DOESN'T GRAFFITI
THE CHURCH.

NATE.
WHAT?

LOOK AT HIS ROOM.

HE VANDALIZED MY STORE.

AND I'M HERE BECAUSE OF HER.

YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE OF YOU
AND YOUR ACTIONS.

SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?
YOUR ACTIONS?

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
EVERYBODY, PLEASE SETTLE DOWN.

RUBY, HAVE A SEAT.

COULDN'T YOU HAVE WARNED ME?
I DIDN'T KNOW.

THE COURT MANDATED HE ATTEND.

DID THE JUVIE COURT SEND
LITTLE MASON FOR SOME THERAPY?

HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
YOUR MOM SEND YOU?

DEE, SIT DOWN.

THE NEW GUY'S GOT A MOUTH
THAT NEEDS CLOSING.

NOT IN MY MEETING!

HE HAS ZERO RESPECT
FOR ANYTHING. GOOD LUCK.

BLAME YOUR GOD.

HEY! THAT'S IT, THIS ENDS HERE.

MASON, RUBY, YOU WANNA LEAVE?

I WILL TAKE IT UP WITH YOU
AFTERWARDS

AND WE'LL MAKE OTHER
ARRANGEMENTS.

I'M NOT LEAVING.

WHY SHOULD I LEAVE?


IS IT WORTH ALL THIS, DAD?

JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING'S
DIFFICULT

DOESN'T MEAN IT ISN'T
WORTH DOING.

I MISS HIM.

I DO TOO, SON. [CRYING]

SO ALL COMMENTS ARE
DIRECTED ONLY AT ME

AND ONLY ON THE SUBJECT
AT HAND, OKAY?

OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT RULES.

WHY DO WE HAVE THEM?

TO KEEP EVERYONE IN LINE.

YEAH. TO KEEP PEOPLE
FROM ACTING LIKE FOOLS.

WELL, YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

WITHOUT SOME SORT OF RULES,
THERE'D BE TOTAL CHAOS.

YOU COULDN'T PLAY FOOTBALL.

COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL
WITHOUT RULES.

AND WE EVEN HIRE PEOPLE
TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES

LIKE JUDGES, REFEREES,
POLICEMEN.

AND THEN THEY MAKE UP
THEIR OWN RULES.

MASON.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT SET
OF BASIC RULES

MANY SOCIETIES BASE THEIR CODE
OF CONDUCT ON?

THE PRIME DIRECTIVE?

NO.

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
FROM THE BIBLE.

WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS ARE HERE, RIGHT?

GOD'S LAWS.

YES, A SET OF BIBLICAL
LAWSRELATING TO ETHICS AND WORSHIP.

THE WORD OF GOD.

MASON, IF THERE'S ONE
COLLECTIVEKEY TO THESE LAWS OR RULES,

WHAT WOULD IT WOULD BE?

OBEDIENCE?

YEAH, THAT'S PART OF IT.

BUT IT'S MORE ABOUT WHY

WE SHOULD BE OBEDIENT
TO THESE RULES.

LOVE?

PRETTY CLOSE, LACEY.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

IT'S RESPECT.

RESPECT FOR GOD,
RESPECT FOR YOUR PARENTS,

RESPECT FOR OTHERS
AND THEIR PROPERTY.

SO THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S
SO MESSED UP.

SOME GUY LIVING IN A CAVE
LOOKING AFTER SHEEP

TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO IS
GOINGTO DICTATE HOW WE LIVE TODAY.

SO MASON, YOU DON'T FEEL
THAT CONSIDERATION

FOR OTHERS IS IMPORTANT?

WHY? HUH?

SO WE CAN HONOR PARENTS
WHO BEAT US?

SON, IF SOMEONE HAS HURT YOU,
I AM SORRY.

THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

BUT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING
SEEMS OUTDATED

DOES NOT MAKE IT WRONG.

LIKE WE CAN'T EVEN SAY
THE WORD, "GOD".

C'MON.

LITTLE KIDS SING 'STICKS
AND STONES MAY BREAK MY BONES'

BUT THE CREATOR OF THE
UNIVERSECAN'T HANDLE HIS NAME

BEING TOSSED AROUND?

I TOLD YOU.

MASON, ONCE AGAIN,
IT'S ABOUT RESPECT.

IT'S ABOUT REVERENCE.

AND WHO GETS THIS RESPECT?

YOU?
IF I'VE EARNED IT.

HER?
IF SHE'S EARNED IT.

THE MAN IN THE MOON?

IF THE MAN IN THE MOON
HAS EARNED IT.

YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE YOU?

WHY NOT HIM?

BECAUSE HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT.

AND YOU DO?

AT LEAST I'M NOT OUT
VANDALIZING STUFF!

YOU'VE NEVER MADE A MISTAKE?

OKAY, GUYS, THAT'S ENOUGH.

AS WE'VE PROVEN TO EACH OTHER
TONIGHT,

RESPECT FOR OTHERS IS NOT
ALWAYS EASY.

NOR DO WE ALWAYS DESERVE IT.

BUT JUST THINK, RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW,

IF WE DO RESPECT EACH OTHER,

HOW DIFFERENT THIS CONVERSATIONMIGHT BE?

IT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUIETER.


NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
FROM YOU.

YOU GOT SOME GUTS.

AND YOU'D ALREADY MADE UP
YOUR MIND?

PRETTY GIRL, NICE CLOTHES.

THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE IN HERE
TO HAND OUT COOKIES.


KEEP IT UP, MACY.

NEXT TIME I'LL TEACH YOU
ABOUT RESPECT.

HEY, SOMETHING GOING ON?

I'VE GOTTA GO.

SEE YOU NEXT TIME?

YOU BRINGING COOKIES?

THAT'S GREAT.

BUT YOU'D BETTER
STEER CLEAR OF THAT ONE.

HER DAD IS...
TOM.

MAY I, MAY I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

JUST GO WAIT BY THE CAR,
TWO MINUTES.

[CLEARS THROAT] TOM,
IT'S GREATWHAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO DO,

BUT THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

THIS KID HAS ATTITUDE.

OH, JUST DISCOVERING THAT.

I'M NOT SURE HE CAN STAY
IN THE GROUP.

THE COURT MANDATED IT.

THE COURT MANDATED A GROUP.

IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS ONE.

AND RUBY, THE CONVENIENCE STOREOWNER,
IS ALSO IN THIS GROUP.

SHE COMES BY.
OH?

YEAH, A FEW YEARS AGO
FOR ASSAULT.

SHE DID HER TIME,
BUT SHE LIKES COMING HERE

AND IT'S HARD TO ASK HER
NOT TO STAY, YOU KNOW.

BUT NOT FOR MASON?

I'M JUST TRYING TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE GROUP, TOM.

AND IT'S PROBABLY TOUGH ON HIM
TO SEE HER HERE,

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

A TALK WITH HIM.

THANKS, TOM.
YEAH.

GUESS HE DIDN'T SAY
I WAS HIS STAR PUPIL?

HE, UH, HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
IN THE GROUP.

TOUGH. THE COURT PUT ME THERE.

YES, BUT HE RUNS THE GROUP,

AND IF HE ASKS THE COURT
TO TRANSFER YOU,

THAT'LL, THAT'LL PROBABLY
HAPPEN.

TYPICAL.

WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING EVERYONE?

WHITNEY AND I ARE TRYING TO HELP

AND YOU'RE TREATING US
LIKE ENEMIES.

EVERYONE DOES STUFF
FOR THEIR REASONS.

SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH BEING
TRANSFERRED?

NO. I WANT TO STAY HERE.

REALLY?

WHY?

LIKE I SAID, EVERYONE DOES
STUFF FOR THEIR REASONS.

[DOOR SLAMS]

[TEXT SENDS]

ALMOST DONE, DAD?

JUST ABOUT.

I'M ON THE LAST DAY
OF THIS WEEK'S SCHEDULE.

GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M HUNGRY.

HOW ABOUT PIZZA?

WORKS FOR ME.


LOVING FATHER, I NEED YOUR HELP.

I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA
PAY ALL THIS.

I'M REALLY STRUGGLING.


[PHONE CLICKING]

[STREET NOISES]

WHERE'S MASON?

I TRIED.

I DON'T WANT TO PUSH TOO HARD,
HE'LL JUST DO THE OPPOSITE.

DAD, I'VE GOT IT.

ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, HONEY.

I'VE GOT TO RUN.

OKAY.


YOUR BREAKFAST IS ON THE TABLE.

YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES TO EAT
AND GET READY.

I'M NOT GONNA TO BE LATE
BECAUSE OF YOU.


[DOOR OPENS]



[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

DAD, WE NEED TO GO.

DAD, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

LET ME GO GET MASON.
DAD...

WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION ABOUT?

OH. WELL, GOOD MORNING.

LET'S GO.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

HEY, LACE.

HOW WAS SCHOOL?

FINE.

THAT DIDN'T SOUND SO GOOD.

JUST SOME OF THE KIDS ARE
BEING MEAN.

WELL, WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

PATTI'S IGNORING ME.

GRACE WON'T EAT WITH ME ANYMORE.

DID YOU DO SOMETHING?

NO!

WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

WHY IS IT ALWAYS MY FAULT?

SWEETHEART, I'M JUST ASKING.

LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW.

I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU DON'T KNOW.

I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

LACE?

YOU DON'T THINK THAT'D BE HARD?

NEW SCHOOL, NO FRIENDS?

AND YOU THINK MOUTHING OFF
TO YOUR TEACHERS

MAKES IT ANY EASIER?

I GIVE WHAT I GET.

BUT THEY'RE YOUR TEACHERS.

SHOW SOME RESPECT.

WHY SHOULD I?

YOU MIGHT GET WHAT YOU GIVE.

GO ALONG WITH THINGS.

MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER ON THEM,
THEY'LL MAKE IT EASIER ON YOU.

SO BE A PHONY?

NO, NO.

JUST SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT.

HEY DUDE, JUST BE SMART.

PLAY THE SYSTEM.

SCHEMERS AND PHONIES,
GREAT ROLE MODELS.

DINNER'S IN TWO HOURS, GUYS.

STUPID WINDOW.



GO AWAY.

I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK.

OKAY, FINE.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

LET ME PAINT YOUR ROOM.

YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M JOKING?

OKAY.

DON'T EXPECT ME TO RETURN
THE FAVOR THOUGH.

DON'T WORRY, IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

THIS ABOUT JACK?

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

OKAY, GO AHEAD.

HAVE WE MADE A MISTAKE?

I WAS NEVER SURE ABOUT IT,
BUT WE CAN'T BACK OUT NOW.

YOU SAID YOU FELT CALLED, RIGHT?

YEAH. FELT IT.

FIELDS SAID THE SAME THING.

WELL, THEN WE HAVE TO
HONOR THAT.

IT'S JUST BEEN SO HARD ON NATE.

I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE TWO
WILL EVER GET ALONG.

YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT PAINTING.

YEAH, FOSTER FAMILIES NEED
A LOT OF MANUAL LABOR.

WHAT'S THAT LIKE, LIVING
WITH DIFFERENT FAMILIES?

OH, WELL, SOME GOOD, SOME BAD.

I'VE HAVE FRIENDS WHO'VE
HAD GREAT FAMILIES.

BUT NOT YOU?

I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

I'M JUST SAYING THAT SOMETIMES
IT'S HARD.

I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY ON ME.

WHY'S THAT?

BECAUSE I HAVE THIS NEW
FOSTER BROTHER

WHO'S JUST MESSING UP
EVERYTHING.

YEAH, THAT SOUNDS TOUGH.

REAL JERK, HUH?

HE HAS HIS MOMENTS.

YOU KNOW, NO ONE'S EVER
CALLED ME BROTHER BEFORE.

NATE! MASON! TIME FOR DINNER.

JUST PUT A PLASTIC BAG OVER
ITAND I'LL PUT IT IN THE FREEZER.

IT'LL THAW AFTER DINNER
AND WE CAN CONTINUE.

THANKS.

YOU COULDN'T HAVE JUST
CALLED HER MRS. TUCKER?

MOM AND DAD ARE GOING TO FREAK.

HER FIRST NAME IS ANN.

YEAH, BUT SHE'S A TEACHER.

TEACHERS ARE CALLED MR.
AND MRS. AND MISS.

THEY ONLY DO THAT TO KEEP US
IN OUR PLACE.

YEAH.

YOU'RE REALLY BAD WITH NAMES,
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

IT'S WHAT FIRST DEFINES US.

PEOPLE CAN USE NAMES TO PUT
YOU DOWN OR CATEGORIZE YOU.

BUT THE TEACHERS WANT
RESPECT ALSO.

MAKE THEM EARN IT. COME ON.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

SO DO YOU KNOW LACEY AT ALL?

LACEY FIELDS?
THE PREACHER'S KID?

PREACHER'S KID, CAN'T BE.

SHE'S IN THAT GROUP WITH ME.

YUP, THAT'S THE ONE.

HER DAD'S THE PASTOR
AT OUR CHURCH

SO I SEE HER THERE ALL THE TIME.

SHE'S PRETTY.

SO YOU DO LOOK AT MORE
THAN JUST BOOKS.

OH, HA HA.

DO YOU LIKE HER?

I HEARD SHE GOT PUT
IN THAT GROUP

FOR BULLYING PEOPLE
ON THE INTERNET.

REALLY?

HA! GOT YOU, I WIN.

THAT'S NOT FAIR.

CAN I HOPE THIS IS ABOUT NATE?

HERE ARE THE ISSUES:

THE GROUP LEADER DOESN'T WANT
YOU THERE ANYMORE.

THE PRINCIPAL SAYS YOU'RE
OUT OF CHANCES.

THERE WON'T BE ANYMORE.

NEXT STEP IS SUSPENSION
OR EXPULSION.

AND THEN THERE'S
THE VANDALISM CHARGES.

ALL OF THESE IN JUST THREE DAYS.

WELL, ISN'T THERE SOME SORT
OF A GRACE PERIOD?

I MEAN, I THINK THAT WE'RE
DOING BETTER NOW.

SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.

THAT GROUP IS A MANDATORY THING.

IF HE DOESN'T ATTEND IT,
HE GETS SENT TO JUVIE.

AND IF HE'S NOT IN SCHOOL,
HE GETS SENT TO JUVIE.

AND IF THOSE CHARGES AREN'T
MITIGATED IN SOME WAY,

HE GOES TO JUVIE.

ANYTHING TO SAY, MASON?

LOOKS LIKE I'M HEADING TO JUVIE.

REALLY? THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO, JUST GIVE UP, MOVE ON?

YOU TELL ME.

COULD YOU EXCUSE US,
MASON, FOR A MINUTE?

I NEED TO SPEAK TO MR.
AND MRS. LEWIS ALONE.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]


YEAH, SURE, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

YOUR WINDOW.

I THINK IT'S BEST AND SAFEST
FOR EVERYONE

IF MASON'S JUST HANDED OVER
TO JUVENILE DETENTION.

HE'S BEEN HEADED THAT WAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

WE'VE... BUT WE'VE ONLY HAD HIM
A FEW DAYS.

THIS ISN'T YOUR PROBLEM.

THE KID WAS MESSED UP
WHEN HE GOT HERE.

DON'T LET IT BECOME MORE
THAN YOU CAN HANDLE.

JUST LET US THINK ABOUT IT.

THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP
SESSION TONIGHT.

MAYBE HE SHOULD JUST GO TO THAT

AND WE'LL, WE'LL SEE
HOW IT GOES.

OKAY.

I'LL BE AROUND IF ANYONE
NEEDS ME.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

WHERE ARE YOUR CHAPERONES?

I'M GOING TO BE SENT TO JUVIE
UNLESS YOU DROP THOSE CHARGES.

YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

WE SHOULDN'T BE
TALKING LIKE THIS.

I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

OH, DID SOMEBODY ELSE PAINT
'BLAME GOD' ON MY STORE?

YOU ANTAGONIZED ME.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET BY.

YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT HAS IT ROUGH.

I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT YOU
HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS.

YEAH, I GET IT.

NO ONE CARES ABOUT ANYTHING
BUT THEIR OWN STUFF.

NOT CHRISTIANS, NOT GOD.

HEY, SHOW SOME RESPECT.

IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT HE THINKS,

WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING ME?

MAYBE I AM BY NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

OR MAYBE IF YOU ACTUALLY SAIDYOU
WERE SORRY FOR WHAT YOU DID,

IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

NOT LIKELY.



MACE, COME ON. WE NEED TO TALK.


I'D LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HE WAS PRETTY MAD.

THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TALK.

DAD, MOM, HE JUST NEEDS A BREAK.

HONEY, HE'S NOT HAPPY HERE.

YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T
FORCE HIM TO STAY.

WELL, IF JACK WAS IN TROUBLE,
WOULD YOU SEND HIM AWAY?

THIS IS DIFFERENT, NATE.

IF YOU SAY SO.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST SEE
WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT.

YOU THINK HE SHOULD GO
BACK TO THE GROUP?

WELL, YEAH.

I MEAN, HE IS SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE.

YOU KNOW, WHY SHOULD
HE HAVE TO LEAVE

JUST BECAUSE OF OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE GROUP?

YOU KNOW, WHY NOT THEM?

YOU WEREN'T SO SURE
ABOUT HIM BEFORE.

YEAH, I KNOW, BUT HE'S
GOT A POINT.

YEAH.

MASON'S NOT JACK.

NO, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
PART OF THIS FAMILY.

THIS IS SOMETHING WE TOOK ON
AND I JUST...

I JUST FEEL LIKE WE NEED
TO SEE IT THROUGH.

I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU TOO.

WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET DINNER GOING.

OH YEAH, OKAY,
I'LL GO GET IT READY.

OKAY, I'LL SEE IF I CAN
GET HIM OUT OF HIS ROOM.


SHHHH! SHHH, SHHH!

MY DAD'S KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR!

MACE? [KNOCKING]

C'MON, OPEN THE DOOR.

WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

IT'S "MASON".

HOLD, HOLD ON.

MACE, OPEN UP! WE NEED TO TALK.

LET ME DO IT.

HE NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE RULES
OF THE HOUSE.

WELL, MAYBE IF WE GIVE HIM
A LITTLE RESPECT, HE WOULD.

LIKE, HE LIKES 'MASON'
NOT 'MACE," DAD.


[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

TIME FOR DINNER.

[DOOR OPENS]


LITTLE BROTHERS ARE FOR.


I'LL WASH MY HANDS
AND BE RIGHT OUT.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[STREET NOISES]

[DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE]

LACEY, SWEETHEART.

WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

JUST TEXTING WITH LORI.

MY HOMEWORK'S BASICALLY DONE.

I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR HOMEWORK.

I AM WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

I'M FINE.

YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
TEXTING, TWITTING, FACING,

ANY OF THAT STUFF.

IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, DAD.

OKAY.

SO WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

JUST GIRL STUFF.

FRIENDS, SCHOOL, BOYS...
HOMEWORK.

BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
GOT YOUINTO TROUBLE LAST TIME.

IT WASN'T MY FAULT!

WHY CAN'T YOU TRUST ME?

THERE'S TRUST AND THEN
THERE'S BEING BLIND.

DID YOU SAYING ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYONE ELSE?

DAD! EVERYONE DOES IT!

WOULD ANYONE BE UPSET
WITH WHAT YOU'VE SAID?

THIS ISN'T FAIR!

THEY'RE SAYING ALL
THIS STUFF ABOUT ME

AND I CAN'T POST BACK?

YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT
THEY'RE CALLING ME!

LISTEN, IF YOU JUST IGNORE IT
THEY'LL LOSE INTEREST.

I'M NOT FIVE YEARS OLD!

I HATE THEM AND I HATE THAT
I'M THE ONLY ONE IN TROUBLE

AND I HAVE THAT I HAVE TO GO
TO THAT STUPID GROUP!

WE CAN CHANGE GROUPS?

THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE IN A GROUP!

LOOK, YOU JUST NEED TO
GET THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

YOU DO YOUR BEST.

YOU LEARN EVERYTHING
YOU CAN FROM IT.

I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
A GOOD GIRL, REALLY.

AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T
BELONG IN GROUP.

HEY, LACE, I LOVE YOU.

I ALWAYS WILL.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

I'LL BACK YOU TO STAY HERE,
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TOO.

WHAT ABOUT WHAT SWANSON SAID?

SHE SAID THAT WE HAVE TO
FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK.

LET'S FIND A WAY.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

ALL THE LEGAL PARKING IS ON
THE EAST SIDE OF THE...

EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

AH, COME HERE A MINUTE.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

DROPPING MASON OFF.

HE'S DISRUPTIVE.
HE WAS TOLD NOT TO COME.

NO, NO, IT WAS SUGGESTED
THAT HE NOT COME.

THERE'S A COURT ORDER THAT
SAYSTHAT HE HAS TO ATTEND A GROUP.

ALL RIGHT, MAN, WE CAN
ALWAYS FIND ANOTHER GROUP.

AND IF THIS IS A SUPPORT GROUP
FOR 'PEOPLE ON THE EDGE.'

AND DOESN'T BEING DISRUPTIVEKIND
OF COME WITH THE TERRITORY?


MAN, OKAY.

I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL SWANSON.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

AWKWARD.

YOUR OLD MAN FIGHT
ALL YOUR BATTLES?

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT?

WHY DON'T YOU TEACH
THIS GUY A LESSON?

STOP!

OR BOTH OF YOU
WILL GET KICKED OUT.

NOBODY WANTS YOU HERE.

EVEN SHE WANTS YOU GONE.

HEY, LEAVE ME OUT OF IT!

BET THERE WOULDN'T BE
MANY HERE WHO'D VOTE

TO KEEP YOU AROUND EITHER.

AND YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN
IN THIS GROUP.

YOUR MOM JUST USES IT AS
AN EXCUSE TO SEND YOU AWAY.

WOW, NOW HE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MOM.

LEAVE MY MOM OUT OF IT.

AHH. SORE SPOT.

SHE HAVE OTHER GROUPS FOR YOU
ON OTHER NIGHTS?

SLOW LEARNER'S CLUB?

MOUTH BREATHERS NIGHT?

TIME YOU LEARNED SOME RESPECT.

STOP!

STOP IT!

OKAY, KNOCK IT OFF.

NO, NO!

HEY, HEY, HEY!

ENOUGH, ENOUGH!

MASON!


HEYA, BUD.

I JUST WANTED TO SAY 'THANKS'.

WHAT FOR?

FOR MAKING AN EFFORT WITH
MASON AND FOR WORKING HARD

THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

AND FOR PAINTING THE ROOM!

HE HELPED TOO.

A LOT ACTUALLY.

HAS TO BE A GOOD SIGN, RIGHT?


LACEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

WELL, DEE WAS MOUTHING OFF
TO MASON.

OH C'MON! HE WAS ASKING FOR IT.

LET HER SPEAK!

WHAT'RE YOU AFRAID OF?
NOT YOU THAT'S FOR SURE!

HEY, HEY, GUYS! KNOCK IT OFF!

OKAY, MASON!

NOT ANOTHER WORD, YOU GUYS!

FRIGHTENED OF SOMETHING DEE-DEE!

KEEP IT UP SMART MOUTH!

HEY!

COULD YOU GUYS PLEASE SIT DOWN?

SIT DOWN.

ALL YOUR GROUPS LIKE THIS?

HE'S GOT TO GO.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

HOLD, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT WAS
HIS FAULT.

IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

MR. LEWIS, YOU CAN MAKE
THE DECISIONS AT HOME,

HERE MR. WALLACE RUNS THE GROUP.

WELL, WHAT'S HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

WE'LL FIND HIM ANOTHER GROUP.

AND ANOTHER GROUP,
OR SCHOOL OR FAMILY.

THEY'LL DECIDE I'M NOT WORTH IT.

I'M THE EASY TARGET
SO BLAME IT ON ME.

WHY NOT?

UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE
CHARGES AGAINST YOU

THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO.

C'MON.

[HEAVY SIGH]

HOLD ON.

WHAT IF I DROPPED THE CHARGES?

WHAT?

WHAT IF I DROPPED THE CHARGES?

IT'S NICE THAT YOU'RE
FEELING SORRY FOR HIM,

BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S
TO HIS BENEFIT.

I'M NOT FEELING SORRY FOR HIM.

I JUST WANT A SOLUTION
THAT BENEFITS EVERYONE.

LIKE?

HE WORKS FOR ME AFTER SCHOOL
AND SATURDAYS, FREE OF CHARGE.

FOR... TWO MONTHS.

CAN SHE DO THIS?

SHE CAN DROP THE CHARGES. SURE.

THEN SHE REQUEST RESTITUTION.

KNOWING THE JUDGE,
SHE'LL PROBABLY GO FOR IT.

KEEPS HIM OUT OF THE SYSTEM
ANDABIDES BY THE VICTIM'S WISHES.

WHAT ABOUT THE GROUP?

HE'D HAVE ATTEND IT,
OR SOMETHING LIKE IT.

IT'S BEEN MANDATED BY THE COURT.

WELL HE'S NOT DOING IT HERE.

YOU SAW WHAT WENT DOWN.
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

IF HE'S NOT DOING THE GROUP,
I'M NOT EITHER.

I'M NOT MANDATED TO BE HERE
BY ANY COURT.

ME TOO.

YOU HAVE TO COME HERE.

MY DAD WANTS ME TO SWITCH.

WHAT ABOUT YOU?

IF YOU'RE NOW WILLING TO DO
THIS, NONE OF THIS MATTERS.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

FINE.

FINE ISN'T GONNA CUT IT.

YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME
AND DO WHAT I SAY.

THAT GOES IN HERE TOO.

YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO WALLACE.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

DO YOU STILL HAVE MY BACK?

I DO.

PART OF THAT IS POINTING YOU
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

THIS IS IT.

AH C'MON! HE'S NOT WORTH IT.

HE AIN'T GOING TO DO IT.

I'M SORRY ABOUT MY
BEHAVIOR, WALLACE.

I'D LIKE TO STAY.

I'LL DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

OKAY MASON.

WELCOME TO THE GROUP.

WE'LL TRY TO MAKE A FRESH
START OF THIS, HUH?

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

HEY, THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS
IS GOING TO WORK?

IT'S ALL GOING TO DEPEND ON HIM.

HE HAS ZERO CHANCES LEFT
AND NO OTHER OPTIONS.

AND THAT RUBY LADY SOUNDS TOUGH.

I WOULDN'T WANT HER
TO BE MY BOSS.

NO, I WOULDN'T EITHER.

ALRIGHT.

LET'S GET BACK TO
THE COMMANDMENTS.

WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY
ALL DEAL WITH RESPECT, RIGHT?

CLEARLY WE CAN SEE FROM
TONIGHT'S ALTERCATIONS

THAT WHEN THERE'S NO RESPECT,
THERE'S NO PEACE.

IF YOU RESPECT SOMEONE,
YOU DON'T STEAL FROM THEM,

OR LIE TO THEM, ETC.

AND IF YOU RESPECT GOD,
YOU DON'T WORSHIP ANOTHER ONE,

YOU DON'T TAKE HIS NAME IN VAIN,

AND YOU DON'T WORK
ON HIS DAY OF REST.

MASON, CAN YOU DISAGREE?

YOUR INTERPRETATION'S FINE.

IT'S THE IDEA THAT GOD
DEMANDS RESPECT FROM US.

WHAT FOR?

JUST SO HE CAN FEEL
ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY?

SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS
AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX.


YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE.

I SUGGEST YOU SHOW SOME RESPECT,

BUT I GUESS YOU THINK OTHERWISE?

'CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE.'

AND YET HE'S GOING TO WORRY
WHAT I THINK OF HIM?

WHAT I CALL HIM?

WHAT IF IT WAS GOOD FOR US?

WHAT, LIKE VEGETABLES?

EXACTLY.

WHAT IF HONORING GOD ACTUALLY
KEPT US SAFE AND HAPPY

AND LIVING GOOD LIVES?

PSALM 31 SAYS:
'HOW GREAT IS YOUR GOODNESS,

WHICH YOU HAVE STORED UP
FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU.'

YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.

I SAID "WHAT IF IT WAS".

WELL, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT SHOULD BE A COMMANDMENT.

'THOU MUST WORSHIP ME AND
ONLY USE MY NAME FOR PRAISE.'

THAT'S NOT SOMEONE
I WANT TO FOLLOW.

CLEARLY.

BUT WHETHER YOU
FOLLOW HIM OR NOT

THOSE RULES ARE STILL THE SAME.

AND, YOU KNOW,
I WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE

WHO CAN'T EVEN CONSIDER THE IDEA

THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE
OR SOME THING

THAT'S ACTUALLY MORE SIGNIFICANTTHAN HE IS.

YOU TALK ABOUT AN
INFERIORITY COMPLEX?

THE OPPOSITE OF THAT
IS A GOD COMPLEX.

SOMEONE WHO WON'T EXTEND ANY
COMMON COURTESY TO ANYONE

BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY BELIEVESHE'S
BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

WALLACE?

YES?

JUST A QUESTION ABOUT
WHAT YOU TOLD US BEFORE.

MMM HMM.

DID YOU SAY THAT WE'RE NOT HERETO
DECIDE WHO'S RIGHT OR WRONG,

BUT UNDERSTAND LIFE
AND OUR OWN PREJUDICES?

YES, YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. SORRY.

YOU SEE, BEING HUMAN
IS MAKING MISTAKES.

WHAT DETERMINES WHO WE ARE IS
HOW WE HANDLE THOSE MISTAKES.

SAYING 'PLEASE', 'THANK YOU'
AND 'I'M SORRY' ALL MEAN

THAT YOU RESPECT AND CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE

RATHER THAN JUST THINKING
EVERYONE ELSE OWES YOU

SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU'RE
BETTERTHAN EVERYONE ELSE.

SO MASON, I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

I'M SORRY.

THANKS FOR STANDING UP
FOR ME IN THERE.

NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED
FROM THE COOKIE SERVER?

I SEE YOU AT SCHOOL A LOT.

MIND IF I COME OVER
AND TALK SOMETIME?

YOU'RE ASKING FOR PERMISSION
TO TALK TO ME?

I'M NOT MAKING MANY FRIENDS.

I MIGHT NOT BE GOOD
FOR YOUR REP.

I THINK MY REP CAN TAKE IT.

HELLO, MASON.

I SEE YOU'VE MET MY DAUGHTER.

HEY, HELLO MR., I MEAN REVEREND,
REVEREND FIELDS.

WOW.

THAT IS A CHANGE.

I GUESS THIS GROUP HAS BEEN
GOOD FOR SOMEONE?

IT MEANS HE CARES.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT MASON?

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[PAPER CRUMPLES]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

SO THE JUDGE OKAY'D MASON
TO WORK HERE?

YES, AND BECAUSE YOU DROPPED
THE VANDALISM CHARGES

IT WON'T GO ON HIS RECORD.

WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

BUT, BELIEVE ME WHEN
I GET THROUGH WITH HIM,

THAT JUVIE THING'S GONNA
LOOK PRETTY GOOD.

I KNOW THAT'S TRUE.

SO WHEN DO I GET MY NEW
LITTLE HELPER?

TODAY.

THE JUDGE ORDERED HIM TO START
TODAY, RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.

HEY, HOW'D IT GO WITH LACEY?

I SAW YOU GUYS EATING TOGETHER.

SHE'S COOL.

BUT KIND OF SAD TOO.

AND SHE WON'T TELL ME WHY
SHE'S IN THE GROUP.

AND NO VISITS TO THE OFFICE?

NO.

TURNS OUT PLEASE AND THANK YOU
REALLY ARE THE MAGIC WORDS.

HEY, WHEN WE GET HOME DO
YOU WANT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

I CAN'T.

I GOTTA GO TO THAT LADY'S
STOREAFTER I WALK YOU HOME.

HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO REDEEM MYSELF

THIS WEEKEND FROM THE BEATING
YOU GAVE ME LAST TIME?

BRING IT.

[STREET NOISE]

YOU'RE LATE.

IT'S 4:00.

YOU'RE KIDDING.

IT'S PAST 4:00 AND YOU'RE LATE.

IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

I DON'T LIKE HOW
THIS IS STARTING.

YEAH, ME EITHER!

THEN SHOW SOME RESPECT
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME!

I'M SORRY I'M LATE MRS. WORTHY.

IT'S MISS AND YOU CAN
CALL ME RUBY.

THERE'S BEING RESPECTFUL
AND THEN THERE'S JUST

MAKING ME FEEL OLD.

THIS ENTIRE BUILDING NEEDS
TO BECLEANED AND REPAINTED.

ALL BY MYSELF?

ANYONE ELSE HELP YA GRAFFITI
MY WALL?

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

THIS IS MY STORE AND I
WOULDN'THAVE WORKED AS HARD ON IT

AS YOU DID.

JUST DOING WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO.

EASY KID.

I'M IMPRESSED.

YOU WANT A BAG OF CHIPS
OR A CHOCOLATE BAR?

NO. THIS IS GOOD.

AND SO YOU SAY...?

IF SOMEBODY GIVES YOU
SOMETHING YOU SAY TO THEM...

THANK YOU.

THAT WHY YOU GAVE THIS TO ME?

WHAT?

SO I CAN HEAR YOU SAY THANK YOU?

TO PUT ME IN MY PLACE.

SURE.

I DO NICE THINGS FOR PEOPLE
AL THE TIME

SO I CAN PUT THEM
IN THEIR PLACE.

THAT'LL TEACH YOU.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]


IT'S NATE.
COME IN.

WAS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

SHE'S LOVING IT.

TREATING ME LIKE THIS.

I WAS WASHING AND SCRUBBING
THE STORE THE WHOLE TIME.

WOW. THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.

YEAH, I'M EXHAUSTED.

JACK USED TO LOVE THOSE DAYS.

THE DAYS HE FELT LIKE
HE COULDN'T MOVE

AT THE END OF THEM.

HE SAID IT MADE LIFE SEEM FULL.

LIKE HE HADN'T WASTED ANY OF IT.

HE SOUNDS PRETTY COOL.

YEAH, HE WAS.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

HEY, MASON.

YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME TODAY.

I TOLD NATE TO TELL YOU.

YEAH, NO. HE TOLD ME.

SO, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU WANTED
TO BE HERE ON TIME.

JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOUR DAY DIDN'T GO TOO CRAZY.

YOU MEAN, DID I CAUSE
ANY TROUBLE?


WELL, THAT TOO.

I WAS OBEDIENT.
I DID WHAT I WAS TOLD.

IT'S ALL A PART OF LIFE, BUDDY.

JUST WAIT TILL YOU'RE MARRIED.

I'M GONNA TELL MOM
YOU SAID THAT.

GO AHEAD. IT'LL MAKE HER HAPPY.

MAKE HER FEEL LIKE
SHE'S DOING HER JOB.

ALL RIGHT, WELL.

DOING GOOD. KEEP IT UP.

DON'T BE TOO LATE.

REMEMBER YOU HAVE
GROUP MEETING TONIGHT TOO.

OH, JOY.

ANYONE HERE NOT BROKEN ONE
OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS?

SEE WHAT I MEAN?

HMMM.

ANYONE COULD SET UP
A BUNCH OF RULES

AND IN NO TIME THEY'D BE BROKEN.

GOOD POINT, SO WHY HAVE THEM?

LAWS ARE THERE TO PROTECT US.

STRUCTURE HELPS US FEEL SECURE.

IT'S LIKE WITH A DOG.

IF YOU LET IT KNOW
YOU'RE THE BOSS,

IT KNOWS WHAT IT CAN
AND CANNOT DO.

YEAH, BUT THAT'S A DOG.

PEOPLE WANT FREEDOM.

AND IF YOU HAVE TO DICTATE
THAT SOMEONE FOLLOW YOU,

WHAT HAVE YOU REALLY GAINED?

PROBABLY RESENTMENT AND ANGER.

AND IF YOU'RE JUST SETTING
UPRULES SO THAT PEOPLE FAIL THEM,

WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT?

JUST TO MAKE THEM FEEL BAD.

AND THAT THEY NOW OWE
YOU SOMETHING.

HOW'S IT FEEL MASON TO HAVE
DEE SUPPORTING YOU?

OKAY... MAYBE A
LITTLE SUSPICIOUS,

BUT GOOD.

LIKE MAYBE DEE AND LACEY
ARE LISTENING TO YOU

AND RESPECT YOUR OPINION, HMM?

SURE.

AND THAT IN DOING SO,
THEY RESPECT YOU?

THINK ABOUT IT.

OKAY, I GUESS.

LET'S ALL THINK ABOUT THAT.

THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT WE FIGHT WITH

AND ARGUE WITH
AND DO NOT LISTEN TO.

OR GOD.

ARE WE DOING IT FOR GOOD
REASONS OR PRIDE?

ARE WE PUTTING OUR EGO,
OUR WANTS, OUR NAME,

AHEAD OF EVERYONE ELSE, AND HIM?

IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING?

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]


[PAPER RUSTLING]

IF YOU REALLY...

IF I WAS...

OH, FORGET IT.


[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]


HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

IT'S LATE.

YEAH, I'M JUST TRYING
TO FINISH UP.

YOU'VE A GIFT.


GRUNT LABOR. THANKS.

AT WORKING HARD.

AND BEING PRECISE AND DILIGENT.

YOU KNOW, GOD GIVES EACH OF US
A UNIQUE GIFT.

IT WOULD BE A WASTE
TO LOSE THAT.

AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
'THANKS' - MEAN IT.

YEAH, BUT WHAT YOU'RE
PRAISING ME FOR IS EASY.

'HURRAY, I CAN PAINT AND CLEAN.'

NOT LIKE THIS.

PEOPLE CAN'T DO THIS
LIKE YOU DO.

PEOPLE WOULD PAY GOOD MONEY
FOR WORK LIKE THIS.

MATTER OF FACT,

I THINK I COULD GET YOU
SOME WORK.

REALLY?

YOU MEAN I'D GET PAID?

IT'S 'GRUNT' WORK.

WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
I'M GIFTED AT THAT!


I COULD SET UP A MEETING
WITH SOME PEOPLE

THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN YOUR WORK

AND WE CAN HAVE IT
HERE AT THE STORE

AND SHOW OFF YOUR WORK.

WOW!

RIGHT ON!

I MEAN, YES PLEASE!

THANK YOU, RUBY.

NOW THAT SOUNDED GENUINE.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I NEED TO BORROW
YOUR WINDOW AGAIN.

WHAT FOR?

I SAID I'D MEET LACEY.

BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT
AND YOU'VE BEEN DOING SO WELL.

I'M NOT SOME PUPPY.

OKAY, I'M NOT JUST DOING WELL
WHEN I'M FOLLOWING ORDERS.

MIGHT WORK FOR YOU
BUT NOT FOR ME.

OKAY. FINE.


I LIKE IT OUT HERE.

BIG AND OPEN.

NO RULES. NO JUDGMENTS.

THERE'S A SMALL CHAPEL
IN THERE THAT I LIKE TOO.

IT'S PRIVATE AND NEVER USED.

I LIKE BEING ALONE
SOMETIMES TOO.

I GUESS WHEN IT FEELS LIKE
I CAN'T TRUST ANYONE ELSE.

YOU ASKED ABOUT THE GROUP.

I'M THERE BECAUSE OF BULLYING,
ONLINE MOSTLY.

I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE!

IT'S NOT LIKE I THOUGHT
I WAS BEING MEAN.

I WAS JUST...

COMMENTING, BEING FUNNY,
AND THEN DISHING IT OUT

BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE COULD.

THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

NEW KID WITH EVERYONE
WHISPERING AND MAKING FUN

BEHIND MY BACK.

WELL, WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE?!

EVERYONE IS BENDING OVER
BACKWARDS TO HELP YOU

AND YOU'RE TREATING THEM
LIKE DIRT!

LACEY?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

AND MASON.

SON, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

[VEHICLE DRIVES AWAY]

[DOOR OPENS]

THAT WAS REALLY STUPID.

DO YOU JUST NOT CARE?

I MET A GIRL!
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

OH DON'T MASON!

YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

YOU WERE GIVEN SPECIAL
TREATMENTAND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.

YOU BREAK RULES.

YOU BETRAY TRUST.

YOU DISHONOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP YOU!

THEY'LL GET OVER IT.

YEAH, WELL WHAT ABOUT NATE?

HE'S IN TROUBLE NOW TOO.

DON'T YOU EVER THINK
OF ANYONE BUT YOURSELF?


[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

HEY, NATE.

I'M SORRY, MAN,
YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.

WAS IT WORTH IT AT LEAST?

NO. SHE'S MAD,
AND I'M IN TROUBLE.

I DON'T THINK
I'LL SEE HER AGAIN.

OH, SORRY.

YEAH.

IT'S YOUR RISK NOW.

ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO VOUCH FOR HIM?

YES, WE DO.

YEAH, WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO KEEP HIM HERE.

OKAY.

ANYTHING GOES WRONG NOW
AND YOU'RE ON THE HOOK.

YOU'RE CALL.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

OH, LOOKS LIKE THE AUTHORITIES
ARE BACK NEXT DOOR.

AND I WAS JUST GETTING USED
TO THAT BOY.

OKAY.

SO THE NEXT STEPS ARE UP TO YOU.

GOT IT. THANK YOU.

YOU BET.

NO ONE'S EVER STOOD UP FOR ME
LIKE THIS.

YOU'RE WELCOME.

HEY, DON'T FORGET
YOU HAVE THAT MEETING.

C'MON, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE MEETING

WITH WALLACE AND
REVEREND FIELDS.

COME ON, LET'S GO.

THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS:
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE GROUPS?


ARE YOU SURE?

BECAUSE TO STAY MEANS HARD
WORK FROM EVERYBODY IN HERE,

ESPECIALLY YOU.

IT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO START THINKING

ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE SON,
BEFORE YOURSELF.

I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

HOW'S LACEY?

DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT HER,
THIS IS ABOUT YOU, MASON.

THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO
GET THROUGH ALL OF THIS, SON?

I DON'T KNOW.

YOU KNOW, THINGS FINALLY
SEEMEDTO BE GOING GOOD AND NOW,

NOW IT SEEMS EVEN WORSE.

WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO
MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT YOU HAVE

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
BE THANKFUL FOR IT.

EVEN FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP YOU

ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

IT ISN'T ALWAYS ALL GOOD.

THAT'S JUST LIFE, PAL.

I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,
IF THAT'S ALLOWED.

SURE.


[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

I NEED HELP.

AND I'VE ASKED YOU
FOR STUFF BEFORE BUT...

BUT I THINK I NEED
FORGIVENESS MORE.

THE LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT
AND LOVE I GET

I DON'T EVEN DESERVE.

BUT YOU, YOU DESERVE IT ALL.

AND I CAN'T EVEN RESPECT
YOUR NAME...

I'M SORRY.

I'M SO SORRY.

HEAVENLY FATHER, LORD,

LET ME START BY JUST
HONORING YOUR NAME.

LET ME JUST START
BY RESPECTING YOU...

AND WANTING TO PLEASE YOU.

NOT BECAUSE I HAVE TO,

BUT BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

SO, HOW MANY CHANCES
DO WE GIVE THE KID?

I HAVE NO IDEA.

I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR CALL.

BETWEEN THE FOSTER OFFICE
AND THE COURTS,

THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH.

WHERE IS HE?

WE GOTTA LEAVE.

[STREET SOUNDS]

AND PLEASE HELP ME TO THINK
OF OTHERS, LIKE YOU LORD,

AND NOT JUST MYSELF.

LACEY.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

LACEY.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

LACEY.

I'M SO SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

I REALLY AM.

I'M AN IDIOT.

FINE.

YOU'RE SORRY, PLEASE LEAVE.


I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT
NOT LETTING ANYONE BE ABOVE ME

THAT I'VE FAILED TO SEE
WHAT I'M DOING TO OTHERS.

AND I HAD NO RIGHT TO JUDGE.

OKAY, I WANT TO BE ALONE.

I WAS JUST OUTSIDE THINKING
WHAT WOULD A GIRL WHO LIVES

BY TEXTING BE DOING WRITING
ON A CRUMMY PIECE OF PAPER?

[SHUDDERING BREATH]

I'M GUESSING THAT'S A PRETTY
PERSONAL NOTE TRYING

TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING REALLY BAD,
THAT CAN'T BE UNDONE.

HEY, I'VE WRITTEN NOTES
LIKE THAT TOO.

WHEN I'VE REALLY MESSED UP.

WHEN I'VE FELT REALLY ALONE.

I NEVER DID ANYTHING WITH THEM,
BUT CAME CLOSE.

HAVE TURNED ON ME.

LIKE I'M SOME SORT OF LOSER.

LIKE I DON'T COUNT FOR ANYTHING.

AND MY DAD, HE'S GREAT,
BUT HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.

BUT I DO.

AND YOU, YOU COUNT
FOR A WHOLE LOT.

AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

I USED TO BE POPULAR.

I CAN SEE IT.

THE PRETTY GIRL SERVING
PERFECT COOKIES

TO ALL HER PERFECT FRIENDS.

NOT SO PERFECT.

LOOK AT ME NOW.

HERE WITH AN OUTCAST LIKE ME.

BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
IT'S OKAY.

CAUSE WE GOT A FRIEND IN COMMON.

WHO?

JESUS.

MASON, I...

I KNOW. I KNOW.

IT'S A LOT TO TAKE, ESPECIALLY
FROM SOMEONE LIKE ME, RIGHT?

YEAH, I HEARD IT ALL MY LIFE,
OVER AND OVER,

BUT IT'S NEVER MADE
SENSE UNTIL TODAY.

UNTIL I REALIZED HOW
I WAS TREATING HIM.

I KNEW GOD BROUGHT YOU HERE
FOR A REASON.

REVEREND FIELDS...
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T COME...

SON, IT'S OKAY.

OH, SWEETIE...


I AM SORRY.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

THANK YOU, SON.

REALLY.

THANK YOU.

AH, OH MY GOODNESS.

YOU'RE LATE.

WALLACE ASKED ME TO GET YOU
TO RUBY'S.

COME ON, WE GOTTA GO.

I PUT MY NECK OUT FOR YOU!

AND NOW HE'S GONE.

HANG ON A SECOND, RUBY.

LACEY WAS IN SOME TROUBLE.

MASON HELPED HER.

HE DID. A LOT.

IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE'S GONE.

WHY'S THIS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

I, I WAS, I WAS GONNA SUPPLY
THE PAINT AND EQUIPMENT

UP FRONT FOR THE JOB.

I'M BEHIND ON BILLS AND THE
BANK'S READY TO FORECLOSE.

YOU SHOULD, DAD.

WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT
A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS

TO BE DONE AT THE CHURCH.

YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, RUBY.

WE'LL BUY THAT PAINT AND
THE EQUIPMENT FROM YOU.

WHAT DO YOU SAY?

YOU STILL INTERESTED, MASON?

YEAH!

THANK YOU REVEREND!

I MEAN, IF THAT'S STILL OKAY
WITH RUBY?

WELL, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
MY BEST WORKER

UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING
TO COME BACK.

OF COURSE.

THANK YOU RUBY.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

RUBY CALLED AND SAID YOU
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

TOM, IT'S OKAY.

MASON HAS A GOOD REASON
FOR NOT SHOWING UP.

HE WAS HELPING MY DAUGHTER.

MASON JUST GOT HIRED BY
MY DAD TO PAINT THE CHURCH.

AND THEY'RE GONNA BY ALL
THE SUPPLIES AND PAINT

RIGHT HERE AT MY PLACE.

WAY TO GO, MASON!

WELL, HE DID SUCH A GREAT
JOB PAINTING RUBY'S STORE

IT WAS REALLY A NO-BRAINER
TO BRING HIM THROUGH

AND HELP US REDO THE CHURCH.

WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD
OF YOU, MASON.

THANKS.

YEAH, WE REALLY ARE.
YOU DID SUCH A GREAT JOB.

I'VE ONLY GOT ONE THING TO SAY.

WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.


OH.

[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

SO YOU SEE,

ALL THIS YOUNG BOY NEEDED
WAS A CHANCE.

A FEELING THAT SOMEONE WOULD
STAND BY HIM NO MATTER WHAT.

HE NEEDED SOMEONE
TO TEACH HIM REVERENCE.

EXODUS 20:7.

"THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME
OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN;

FOR THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD HIM
GUILTLESS THAT TAKETH

HIS NAME IN VAIN."

"WILL NOT HOLD HIM GUILTLESS..."

THE PASSAGE IS ALSO ONE OF THE
TEN COMMANDMENTS, AS WE KNOW,

BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT IT
HAS THAT ADDITIONAL WARNING

ATTACHED TO THE END OF IT.

"THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD
HIM GUILTLESS..."

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU ALL,
BUT I SURE DO NOT WANT TO BE

NOT FOUND "GUILTLESS"
WHEN JUDGMENT DAY COMES.

CAN I GET AN AMEN TO THAT?

AMEN!

SO AS YOU SEE,

MASON LEARNED
THIS SPECIAL COMMANDMENT

FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANCE
OF SHOWING RESPECT,

BECAUSE RESPECT,
IT'S A HIGH STANDARD.

IT DEMONSTRATES TO US THE WAY
WE SHOULD COMMUNICATE

WITH OTHERS AND THE WAY WE
SHOULD COMMUNICATE WITH GOD,

TO THE LORD HIMSELF.

REMEMBER, IT IS RESPECT
THAT IS THE FOUNDATION

FOR EVERY RELATIONSHIP.

IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE WAY
WE EXPRESS RESPECT FOR HIM,

GOD ALMIGHTY, IN THE PRESENCE
OF OTHERS.

LET US PRAY.

DEAR HEAVENLY FATHER,

WE COME BEFORE YOU TODAY
TO PRAISE AND HONOR

YOUR HOLY NAME...
