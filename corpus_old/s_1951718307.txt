Welcome to the California Gold Coast

A magical land where
the sun always shines

and the surf always rolls

A place where a million dollars
might buy ya a view

of another guy's view

Once upon a time

this was the home
of the legendary Bobby Z

You see that out there, folks

That's Bobby Z's territory, my friends

He ruled those waters

He was Poseidon

He was Neptune

His heart beat with
the rhythm of those waves

And when the sun set

Z blessed this land
with the most amazing

weed known to man

In those days if 5 yuppies smoked a bowl
after their poached salmon

well, it was Z's weed, guaranteed

Z's gone now

6 years, maybe more

Some say he's in Europe

Some say even Thailand, maybe Japan

The doubters, the non-believers say
they all of course, he's dead

But he's coming back. I know it

Water is life

From it he sprang
and to it he shall return

Bobby Z is gonna be rebirthed

Bobby Z is gonna be resurrected

He's coming back

The great Bobby Z is coming back

This guy's perfect

His name is Tim Kearney
3-time loser from Palmdale

He definitely resembles him

Family

Mom's dead, dad split

Hm

Uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters

Tim's an only child
on his own since he was 15

First gets busted when he was a kid
for breaking and entering

when he trips over a lawn sprinkler
on the way out the door

carrying his stash

Goes to juvie, comes out, does it again

By this time he gets a court-mandated
stint in the Marines

Gets his ass sent to Iraq
Hm

Alright, where he wins the Navy cross

and then gets a dishonorable discharge

For what

Beating up an Iraqi colonel

Should've give 'im a medal

Then he comes back to the States

where he commits assault
and battery strongarm

on a convenience store clerk

for raising the price
on an ice cream bar

Thought it was eightyfive cents
Dollar fifteen

Strike 1

Now get this. He gets paroled, right
Mm

His dipshit buddy Wayne picks him up

On the way home
he stops at a gas station

Tim's waiting in the car, Wayne goes in

Okay, here's the beaut

Wayne robs the gas station

Tim takes the rap

Open the door! Open the door

Go! Oh shit, there's a cop

There's a cop

Open the door! Go

Strike 2

Which leads us to
our dead biker friend, Maddog

Been here 6 months now, boy

You need protection, and we're it

Just wanna do my time, man

Don't work like that, soldier boy

Strike 3

Heartbreakin'

Yeah

Yeah, he's fucked

The Brotherhood'll get him no matter
what prison yard he ends up on

Shit, Brotherhood'll kill you no matter
where you end up, period

How'd you get to be
such a loser, convict, hm

Uh, what is it, low self-esteem

Lack of impulse control

Man, I can't remember
what they described

Well I see you had a lot of practice
from your file, here

Yeah

You know why you're here

Probably 'cause you want me
to roll over on somebody, right

Wrong. We don't want you
to roll over on somebody

We want you to be somebody

That's what my mom used to say

Why don't you stop fooling around

and maybe just maybe
if you do like I say dude

you can walk away
from here and keep walking

Would you like that convict

Good

Look at him

Look at him

Who does he look like

Does he look like anybody you know

Well he kinda looks like me

You know who that is

That is Bobby Z

Robert James Zacharias, man

Grew up in Laguna Beach

While you were shitting
your life down the toilet

he was The Dude

The Man
Oh, he had it all, man

The hottest women, the finest clothes

the best dope

He was living the life, man

But he had another talent

See, Bobby was also
a very accomplished drug dealer

Matter of fact, he was a legend at 16

Couldn't even get a driver's license

He hitchhiked to
and from his first weed buy

2 Nike bags, 8 Ki's of Maui Wowee

Z turns 2 gym bags into 4
4 into 16, 16 into 32

Unlike you convict
he figures it all out

'Cause he never puts
his own ass on the line

But he's getting some unwanted
attention not from the cops

but from some other

businessmen, some rivals

2 of his best runners end up face-down

in a drainage ditch
out there in Riverside

So what does Z do

He disappears

like morning mist

Now the dope still keeps coming

And we're wondering how

Turns out

Bobby Z's got a marketing system

Yeah, it's genius

Cutouts, bonuses, agents

Profit-sharing

All kinds of shit

I mean he's bringing in boatloads of
the best weed from all over the world

brings it in electronically

running his empire from afar

like he's a goddamned
wizard of weed or some shit

So what do you want me to do

Don Huertero

Biggest drug dealer in Northern Mexico

Runs Tijuana, runs Baja, runs San Diego

He wants to partner up with Bobby Z
and start marching north

to Los Angeles

Now, this Don Huertero
is holding a man in Mexico

His name is Art Moreno
He's my partner

He's a good man. He's got five kids

and I'm godfather to all of 'em

I'd like my partner to see
my partner come home alive

Don Huertero has agreed
to make an exchange

Art Moreno for Bobby Z

But only for Bobby Z

So why don't you find him

We had him

Turned himself in, in the embassy
in Thailand, sick as a dog

Got bit by some Asian bug

Walks into the embassy

says his name is Robert James Zacharias

says he's dying

says he needs to speak with somebody

so I'm on a plane pronto

But I'm too late

Kaboom, heart attack

Drops dead right there in the embassy

God damn bug killed him

So listen up

This is where you come in

Look

Don Huertero's got
no sense of humor about this shit

If he finds out
that the real Z is dead

he'll kill my partner

Dead for dead

You pretend to be Z

We make a trade with you at the border

and if you walk away, well

you walk away

Man, the second I walk in there

Don Huertero's gonna know
I'm not Bobby Z

Huertero and Z have never met
It's up to you

You take your chances on the border
pretending to be Bobby Z

or we leave you here
at the Hotel California

Perfect

I'll be damned

Tell me how you got that scar again

l...

I. I, I

I was surfing and my head bounced
off a rock when I wiped out

Where

Uh, Three Arch Bay

What kind of car do you drive
A sixty-six Mustang

Favorite color
Yellow

Favorite football team
He hates football

I hate football

I hate football

Favorite meal

Uh...

Come on! Vegetarian chili

How many times we gotta go over this

Lunch time, Z

You're welcome
Oh, come on man

Can I get some real food

like a cheeseburger or something

No. Z was a vegetarian

And a leftie

You make one mistake
like that with Don Huertero

you're a dead man, okay

Remember her

That's Audrey
No

Not Audrey, Olivia

Olivia

Elizabeth

Oh, yeah, you remember her name

don't you

How long was I with her for

I don't know

I thought you guys knew everything

Why would I wanna be with anybody else

Shut up, and get up

Hey, one last thing

If Huertero mentions The Monk

he was your chief of operations

The Monk

You're just telling me about this now

They won't ask you

Well in case it comes up
you should know

Youguys went to high school together

The Monk went toNotre Dame
then joined the Franciscan Order

He has some serious math skills

Started putting
the monastery's books on Quicken

Fell in love with the internet

Discovered he loved it
more than he loved God

So he quits the church

and helps you
make your business electronic

Without The Monk, Z wouldn't be Z

Here's uh, The Monk's number
and address in case you need it

You got- you got another vest for me

Hey, you just relax
you stand over there for a minute

I sent that recommendation
for your promotion upstairs, Escobar

I'm gonna get your partner
back for you, sir

I appreciate it

Let's go

Good luck

Okay cowboy

Don't shoot

Don't shoot

Don't move

Oh my god.

There's an exchange...

I'm supposed to exchange...

God damn it

Shut up

Let me go
Get up

Get out of the tracks! Move out...

Senor Z

That's me

Mr. Z

Mr. Z

Huh

I brought you clothes

The bathroom's right there

You can uh, shave

I brought you a new toothbrush

Gracias

Mr. Z

Mr. Z. Hi

Mr. Brian would like
to see you right now

if it's convenient

Come on
Sure

Hey

The legend that is Bobby Z

Well, it's an honor, my friend

Brian. Brian Cervier

Good to see you

Well welcome to my humble abode

Get him a glass of wine

Squeezed from my own grapes

Don Huertero apologizes for uh

not being here to greet
you personally, but um

he'll be up on the weekend, so

'til then you just

chill and enjoy the oasis

Bobby Z

Bobby Z

At my hacienda

Who'd have thought

A hundred acres of vineyards

Dating back to the fifteen hundreds

So, what happened out there last night

Cop started shooting
man, so I hit the dirt

It's a dangerous place, the border

Get some towels

So what are your plans

Uh, man, I don't make plans. Just uh...

Really

I'm only asking because Don Huertero
has a proposition for you

A serious one

Well then uh, I'll talk about
that with the don when he gets here

Well I won't take that as an insult

Don't

Alright now, this is a beauty

Horse in England called Great Run

won The National a couple of times

And this, this is its foal

Unfortunately, it broke its leg

Fuckin' useless and I haven't
got the heart to shoot it

This is my most valuable product

You got connections in Thailand, right

Come here

Thais, I get a lot of money for Thais

Give ya a massage and then cook you
a nice green chicken curry afterwards

Hurry up
Hey, what you doing, Dumbo

don't bruise the fruit

It's a product

If you bruise it
then no one will want it

Okay

Bill, just get your men
in order, will ya

You give me some decent money
to pay for help

I wouldn't have morons working for me

Right. So

Massage parlor

Massage parlor

Massage parlor

You, massage parlor

These ugly ones over here
send them to the sweat shop

And this, this is Bobby Z

Pleasure

Likewise

Used to herd cattle

Jules, wait a minute

Who are these people

Oh you know, Eurotrash, crazy Russians

friends from the import export business

And of course the lovely Elizabeth

I trust you slept well

Yeah
And alone

Is that uh, is that her boy

Oh no, that's Olivia's beautiful

beautiful boy

Where is Olivia

She's at Betty Ford

This time for speed

She asked Elizabeth
to look after the kid

6 months ago

Sir Brian

Mm

Your gear

Wherever 2 or more
are gathered in my name

Shut up

Oleg

Oleg. Come on

Mind your own business, bitch

Bobby

He's gonna be dead in a minute

Hi

Hey

You know Bobby, I have never seen you

stick up for anyone but yourself before

I have to admit, the kid
was pretty impressed, too

I don't know much about kids

That's too bad

cause he's yours

Big, bad Boom Boom

How's the meth business

This is my business

Maybe you didn't see
the sign on your way in

I'm a tattoo artist

(speaks Spanish)

Easy, baby

Don't go nowhere

I'm not gonna bite ya

I got a tip for ya

About the guy that did Maddog

Tim Kearney

Mm-hm. Yeah

You and your brothers
been looking for him

but you can't find him, can ya

He'll turn up

Feds still got him in protective custody

Oh no

He's out

If I was you, I'd
start looking down around the border

Excuse me

What's your play in this

Oh, didn't I tell ya

I'm the one that turned him loose

I could do a car bomb

take your legs off, right at the knees

I bet you could

Just cause we doin' business
don't mean you got rights

Come on. Come on, please

What the hell do you want, Grusza

Let's just say Kearney being released
is a case of misplaced trust

Drop him off in a body bag
I'll pretend it was Santa Claus

and that'll be that

Adios

So the boy's mine

That's right

She never told me about him

Yeah. Well you'd have
to be around for that

So does everybody know

Hm-mm

Just Olivia and me

Now you

Olivia asked me not to tell you

So why did ya

'Cause you should know

It's been a long time, Bobby

Yeah, too long

Yeah

So what brought you back

Was it the money

Still want my share

I hadn't forgotten about you

Mm

You're giving me what's mine

Yeah, of course

You really have changed, Bobby

How

Well, in the old days

you would've definitely
had me in bed by now

Let's do it my way

You haven't forgotten
my favorite position, have you

No
No

Do you remember our first time

In my little trailer at El Morro Beach

It's still there, if you need it

Thanks

Noncommittal as ever

Was I bad to you

Yeah. Yeah Bobby, you were

Have you talked to Monk lately

No

You

Once in a while

He still dreams of having me someday

So long as that dream
is alive I'll get what I want

You need his number

No, I have it

You better get going

Why

'Cause when Don Huertero gets here
he's gonna kill you

How do you know that

You know Brian

Yap, yap, yap

Can I come with you? Please

Listen. Please

No, go back in your bedroom

Please. Can I come with you

Hey, I don't know much about kids

That's too bad, 'cause he's yours

Beautiful, beautiful boy

Where do you think you're going, son

I'm leaving

What, are you gonna shoot me

You're not the type

Stop him! Bring him back

Come on

He's getting away

After him

Get him! Go

Alright get off. Hide

Hah! Hah

You came back

Yeah, I'm not too bright

He's heading south
by southwest, Mr. Johnson

Let's go

H'yah, h'yah

Are we out of gas

Yeah, we're out of gas

Son of a bitch

What're we gonna do

Alright, alright
we're gonna play a game now

What game

You know what a marine is

Kind of soldier

No

Marine is a bad ass

You wanna play that game

No

Why not

Navy Seals are tougher

Okay

So we're gonna play Navy Seals

and we're goin' on a secret mission

And we're gonna go up
over that mountain over there

That's so gay

You know the truth of the matter is man

I don't really give a shit
what we play right now

but if we don't play something
they're gonna shoot you

Don't scream at me

You know, forget about it

Let's just go. That was stupid

Let's go, come on. Move it

What

we're gonna walk

No, I just called for a limousineman
It's gonna be here in fifteen minutes

Move out

God

See, you wouldn't 've made
a very good marine anyhow

Whatever

Why are you doing this to me

We were friends

You've ruined everything

You've put my job in jeopardy

Where was Bobby going

I don't know

You know what, I almost believe you

But Don Huertero won't

He might

You know what

He won't

And it's gonna be better for me

if it looks like
I tried harder to find out

Just not my face, okay

What's that

What
Listen

What
Sh

Can you hear it

Run! Run

I got 'em, Johnson

They're a half a mile due west
heading into Cable Rock

Come on, go! Run

Run! Run

Come on! Stop looking

Don't slow down

Go go go

They're all yours, boys

Bring him back alive

Stay outta sight

We're alright

You miss your mom

Yeah

But I like it better with Elizabeth

And why's that

She's not a drug addict

That's good

That's real good

Alright kid, I'm proud of you
but this is go-time right now

This is serious and I need you
to listen to me, Alright

Those bad guys, they're right behind us

They're gonna be here any minute

So when they get here
I'm gonna signal you

and I want you to hide
behind those two rocks right there

Alright, you see those rocks

Okay

There is no way some candyass
surfer from Laguna Beach

knows his way around a desert like this

H'yah! H'yah

Shit

Get behind the rock

Hide behind that rock

I'm gonna cut you up, boy

Come on, cowboy

Come on

Shit

C'mon! Go go go!
C'mon, go, run! Run, c'mon

I got you now, you son of a bitch

Ah, shit

Run your ass off

C'mon, c'mon

God damn horse

Look, I know this looks bad
but I can explain everything

He killed your men and escaped
even from you Mr. Johnson

Let Brian cook in the sun for a while

Mr. Johnson, follow me

Brian is a cowardly degenerate

who gallantly seeks to place
the blame on sweet Elizabeth

He tells me that she warned Mr. Z
about my plans for him

If that's true, and perhaps it is
