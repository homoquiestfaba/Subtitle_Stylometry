MIGO: <i>This is my world.</i>

<i>Harsh, jagged, freezing.</i>

<i>And I gotta say,</i>

<i>it's awesome!</i>

<i>It's got everything.</i>

<i>Ice, rocks, ice, snow, ice.
It's got a lot of ice.</i>

<i>Plenty of modern amenities.</i>

<i>And the best part,
everyone's happy.</i>

<i>That's because
our world is built</i>

<i>on a foundation of stones.</i>

<i>Not those. These.</i>

<i>See, we have these laws
that are written in stone.</i>

<i>Literally, written in stone.</i>

<i>Interpreted and enforced
by the Stonekeeper.</i>

The stones are here to
protect us and keep us safe.

MIGO: <i>They pretty much tell us</i>

<i>everything that we need
to know.</i>

<i>Important stuff, like how
the world was created...</i>

<i>when we all fell from
the butt of the great sky yak.</i>

<i>And how our world is an island</i>

<i>that floats on a sea
of endless clouds</i>

<i>resting on the backs of
the great mountain mammoths.</i>

<i>And how we have to feed ice</i>

<i>to the mammoths
so they don't overheat.</i>

<i>'Cause if they did,
they would die</i>

<i>and we would all fall
into the great nothing.</i>

YETI: There's nothing
down here!

MIGO: <i>But my favorite
stone of all</i>

<i>is the one that says
the gong must be rung</i>

<i>to wake
the great glowing snail</i>

<i>so it can crawl across the sky</i>

<i>and bring light
to the village.</i>

<i>I love that one.</i>

<i>It might be the most
important job of all.</i>

<i>And, humble brag,
that job belongs to my dad.</i>



<i>He does it with passion,
commitment,</i>

<i>and the help of
his able-bodied assistant.</i>

Up and at 'em, Migo!
Time to ring the gong.

MIGO: <i>...me.</i>

Yes!

<i>I guess you could say
I'm learning the ropes.</i>

<i>And the wheel.</i>

<i>And the crank.</i>

<i>Because if my dad
didn't ring the gong,</i>

<i>we'd all be in the dark.</i>

Launch!


MIGO: <i>It isn't easy.</i>

<i>It requires skill,
rock-solid nerves,</i>

<i>and a good,
strong head on your shoulders.</i>

(GONG SOUNDING)
(GRUNTS)

MIGO: <i>Because there's literally
no other way to ring a gong.</i>

Oh, yeah.

MIGO: <i>It gives my dad
a great sense of purpose.</i>

<i>Like I said,
it's an important job.</i>

<i>A job that'll one day be mine.</i>

Whoo-hoo! Good one, Dad!

<i>And I can't wait
for the day</i>

<i>that it's me
who gets to wake the village.</i>

<i>Look at everybody there below</i>

<i>All the yetis
that I love and know</i>

<i>And they're waking up to see
This awesome morning</i>

<i>They've all got a smile
on their face</i>

<i>Another reason
I love this place</i>

<i>'Cause it's always
full of life</i>

<i>And never boring</i>


<i>Look all around us</i>

<i>It's all rock and ice and snow</i>

<i>Frigid and freezing</i>

<i>Yeah, it's pretty great
I know</i>

<i>And hey, hey
It's another day</i>

<i>Like every other</i>

<i>I don't wanna change a thing</i>

<i>Not one little thing, I mean</i>

<i>Because I do
what the stones say</i>

<i>And I'm doing okay</i>

<i>What could be better
than this?</i>

<i>It is what it is</i>

<i>It is perfection</i>

(ALL GRUNTING)


<i>Look at everybody
do their part</i>

<i>And they do it
with a happy heart</i>

<i>And it gives them all
A sense of greater purpose</i>

<i>Well, that's the way
that I wanna be</i>

<i>I wanna make 'em all
proud of me</i>

<i>Just be a steady yeti
at their service</i>

Do you seriously believe

mammoths are holding us up?
CHILDREN: Mmm-hmm.

What's holding
up the mammoths?

Uh, hello.

It's just mammoths
all the way down.

CHILDREN: Oh!
Don't listen to them.

They're questioning
the stones.

And we don't do that. Okay?

<i>If there's a question
Causing you to go astray</i>

<i>Just stuff it down inside
Until it goes away</i>

Got it?
STONEKEEPER: Where's Migo?

Migo, you will never
be the gong ringer...

Wait, what?

...if you don't practice.

He's giving you
your own helmet.

Oh, I blew the surprise!

Sorry, Dad.
(STONEKEEPER GRUNTS)

My own helmet?
You mean today's the day?

Congratulations, Migo.

Big day, son!

Hey, everyone,
I get to do a practice gong!

(ALL CHEERING)
(MIGO LAUGHS AND WHOOPS)


<i>Hey, hey
It's another day</i>

<i>Like every other</i>

<i>And I don't wanna
change a thing</i>

<i>Not one little thing</i>

<i>I mean, because we like
living this way</i>

<i>And we're doing okay</i>

<i>What could be
better than this?</i>

<i>It is what it is
It is perfection</i>

<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

<i>I said doo-doo-doo, doo-doo</i>

<i>It is perfection</i>

<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

<i>You go, Migo, you go. Whoa!</i>

<i>I said doo-doo-doo, doo-doo</i>

<i>It is perfection</i>

Practice gong!

Practice gong!

Practice gong!
Practice gong!

Practice gong!
Practice gong!

YETI 1: Practice gong!
YETI 2: Practice gong!

DORGLE: (GRUNTS) You ready?

Beyond ready! Can't wait
till this is my actual job!

Yup. Soon you will join
a long line of family greats.

<i>Uncle Flathead,
Grandpa Smashhead,</i>

<i>Great Grandpa Shelfhead,
Aunt Crushedhead,</i>

<i>Uncle Mushbrain,</i>

<i>Aunt Bam Bam, No-neck Nando,
Cousin Squatly,</i>

<i>Doug.
And his dumb mallet theory.</i>

We don't talk about him.

And your mom.

<i>Wish she was here
to teach you.</i>

You're doing great, Dad.
Thanks, son.

Okay, first, check your wind.

Doesn't take much
to blow you off course.

Wind, check.

Good. Now, true your aim.

You'll never succeed
if your aim isn't true.

(CRANKING)
MIGO: Aim, check!

Great! Now, this is important.

Even though you know
it's gonna hurt,

Mmm-hmm.
you gotta hit it head-on.

Does it really hurt?

Only for the first
year or two.

Hmm. Did you actually
used to be my height?

Nope, I was much taller.

Took me years to achieve this.

Never missed a day!

Oh, yeah!
Cool!

Ready?
Ready.

Say the word, son.

Launch! Whoo!

Ow.

Uh, did I mention

you gotta keep your feet up?
No.

You gotta keep your feet up.
Check.

Okay. Launch!


Launch!

(WHIMPERS AND EXHALES)

Launch! (EXCLAIMS)

Never seen that happen.

Launch!

Whoo!

Ha-ha!

Attaboy, Migo!

Whoo-hoo!

Oh...

Meechee.


Migo, true your aim!

True your aim!
(GASPS)

Oh, no.
(ALL GASP)




Where's my...

(EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE)

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)


Hmm?

Wow!

What is that?

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

Uh. Uh...

Hey, hey! What?




Stop it! (GRUNTS)

Not funny! (SCREAMS)



Huh?

(GRUNTING)
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)


Argh!


Whoa!

Ahhh!

(SCREAMING IN SLOW-MOTION)


(GASPS AND SHUDDERS)


Whoa. Whoa.

Whoa!



Whoa.

(GASPS EXCITEDLY)

Uh.

(PILOT GRUNTING)


PILOT: Ugh!

(LAUGHS IN RELIEF)



Look at your small foot!

Small foot.

Oh, my gosh, it's a smallfoot!

Oh, no! No. Come back!

Oh!


Oh, holy wowness!

You gotta see this!

Come here, come here,
come here!

Hey, everyone!

Listen, listen! Everyone!

Hey, Migo.
You missed the gong.

I know.

You missed the gong, Migo.
I know.

Come here. Gather round,
gather round. Okay.

I saw a smallfoot!

What?
What?

What?
What?

What?
What?

What?
What?

What?
Ow!

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)
(GASPS)

Just come here and see for
yourself! Let's go, come on!

Everyone, let's go!
FEMALE YETI: Okay.

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

GWANGI: Hmm?
KOLKA: Mmm-hmm.

(FLEEM GRUNTS)

He's crazy!

Dad!



It came at me from the sky.

It was like some sort of
hard, shiny flying thing!

It made a sound like...

(IMITATES METAL SCREECHING)

And that's when
it scooped me up!

Look, it's right this way.


(WIND WHISTLES)

No! But...

Uh...

No! No, no! No!

It was right here!
Hmm?

Look, I swear!
This shiny, flying thing.

That's what the smallfoot
shot out of.

It was like, poof!
(ALL GASP)

And then this big skin thing
landed on top of it.

It was like... (BLOWS)
Ooh!

And then it saw me,

and it sang the most strange,
beautiful song.

It was like... (SHRIEKS)
(GASPS)

Almost, it was more like...

(ALL GASP)

Oh, it's probably still around here somewhere.
Let's look for it. Come on, everyone!

Still around here?

It could be in the village!
It could be at my house!

Get the children!

(ALL SCREAMING)
Migo's gone crazy!

FEMALE YETI: He said he saw
a smallfoot!

MALE YETI: Is that possible?

Oh, there you are!

FEMALE YETI: Is it real?
Wait! Hold on! Everyone!

It didn't seem all that scary!
It was kind of cute!

(ALL CLAMORING)
(HORN BLOWING)

Everyone, make way for my dad!

Uh, I mean, the Stonekeeper.
Sorry, Dad.

I mean, Stonekeeper.
Come on, Thorp. You blew it.

Good morning, everyone!
Hey, how are you?

Oh, boy.

Is this about Migo
missing the gong?

Stonekeeper,
he saw a smallfoot!

It might still be out there!

He said it fell from the sky!

Garry, calm down.
You know how you get.

Okay, I'll try.
But I'm just so scared.

Now, I know Migo has gotten
you all very anxious

with his little "story,"

but there's nothing to fear
because it isn't true.

But I saw one!
(ALL GASP)

No, you didn't.
I did.

You can't have seen it
because it doesn't exist.

I know, I know.

Because the stone says there's
no such thing as a smallfoot.

Yeah, right there,
clear as day.

I know, but it was right there
in front of me!

(ALL GASP)
Hey, Migo!

How do you know
it was a smallfoot?

Because it had a small foot.
(ALL GASP)

Uh, Dad?
(SIGHS)

Daddy, clearly,
he saw something.

Oh, I'm not denying
he saw something.

Most likely, he slipped,
hit his head,

got confused and saw a yak.

(ALL AGREEING)
Oh, okay, I get it now.

Because if Migo is saying
he saw a smallfoot,

then he's saying
a stone is wrong.

Uh...

Is that what
you're saying, Migo?

That a stone is wrong?

Nope! He is not saying that!

Let me talk to him.

Migo, what are you doing?

Challenging the Stonekeeper
in front of the whole village?

Dad, what's the piece of advice
you're always giving me?

"Do what you're told."

The other one.
"Blend in."

The other one.

"Follow the stones."
"Be a cog." "Do your part."

"Never disagree
with the Stonekeeper."

"Always be true!"

That was about hitting a gong.
Not challenging a stone.

'Cause if it goes against
a stone, it can't be true!

But if I say I didn't see
a smallfoot,

then I'm lying.

STONEKEEPER: Migo...

I thought you wanted
to be the next gong ringer.

I do.

Then are you still saying
a stone is wrong?

If saying I saw a smallfoot
means that a stone is wrong,

then I guess I am.

(ALL GASP)

Oh...

(DORGLE SIGHS)

Oh, Migo.

It pains me to say this,
it truly does.

But you leave me no choice.

Disobeying the stones
is a grave offense.

From this day forward,

you will be banished
from the village!

(ALL GASP)
What?

Until you are ready
to stand before us all

and tell us the truth.

I am telling the truth.

That's all, everyone.
Back to work.

Huh?
STONEKEEPER: Let's make it

another perfect day.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Stonekeeper, please.

That's my son.

Just give him a little time
alone out there to think.

He'll come to his senses.

(EXHALES SOFTLY)

Sooze.
THORP: Hey!

You're banished, remember?
You know what that means.

Yes, Thorp.

You do? What does it mean?

STONEKEEPER: Thorp!
Coming!

We'll circle back.

(SIGHS)
(MAMMOTH GRUNTS)

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

(WIND WHISTLING)

PERCY: <i>Few can survive
the cold, brutal environment</i>

<i>of the Himalayas,</i>

<i>but this ingenious creature
defies the odds.</i>

The rare Himalayan
jumping spider!

This week
on <i>Percy Patterson's Wildlife!</i>

This agile arachnid can
lay 1,000 eggs at a time

and can jump 50 feet
into the air!

There's an element
of mental preparation,

I'm sure.
(CAMERAMAN YAWNS)


Oh, no!
(GASPS)

Whoo! The venom!
It's going to my brain!

I can't feel my face.

Keep rolling, keep rolling.

Cut!
(PERCY MUMBLES)

I'm melting before your eyes.

BRENDA: Percy!

And we'll add an effect.
Melting, melting, melting.

(GROANS)
BRENDA: Percy!

Cut this bit out.
I'm gonna shut one of my eyes.

Oh, my eye! My eye!

Cut! What are you doing?

I'm saving our show.

Me being attacked
would get huge ratings!

Our show is educational
and enlightening!

A show that promotes respect

for our fellow creatures
on this planet.

I know.
That's why no one's watching.

That's why I don't watch.
(SIGHS)

Look, Brenda, unless
our spider jumps, it's boring.

Hey, it jumped!



Now, that was exciting.
Did we film that?

No, of course not.

All right, I'll just have
to go over here

and interview a piece
of bark, shall I?

(PANTING) Yeti.
What?

Plane crashed in the snow.

Teeth, claws, huge!

I saw a yeti!


Yeti, you say?

Let me buy you a drink and
you can tell me all about it.

You believe me, right?

PERCY: Of course,
I believe you!

PILOT: You do?
You can trust me.

I fly planes!

FLEEM: (WHISPERING) Migo.
Huh?

Who's there?

FLEEM: Migo.

MIGO: Hello?

Is that you?

Ugh.

Maybe you are going crazy.
No wonder no one believes you.

We believe you.
(SCREAMS)

Hi.
(SCREAMS)


BOTH: Fleem!
What?


Is it just me, or does he look
disappointed that it's us?

You want proof that you saw what you saw?
Yeah.

We got proof.

So, you believe me
that I saw a...

(SHUSHING)
A small...

They're listening.
MIGO: Who?

The ears of oppression.

Yeah.
Uh...

This way, stealth mode.


Could this day get
any more bizarre?

Is this too close?

Uh?
You know what you are now?

One of us.

Uh. Hey, wait up!

One of us! One of us!

Now, don't tell Gwangi
I said this,

but he's a bit paranoid.

GWANGI: Fleem,
are you talking about me?

FLEEM: Do you see what I mean?

Kolka talks to rocks like they can hear her.
KOLKA: Fleem! Shh!

I've been told I'm pesky,
annoying, and a real pain,

but, hey, who listens
to their mom, right?

(LAUGHS)
Uh...

Where are you taking me?

Our leader requests a meeting.

Wait, you have a leader? Who?

You'll see.

Oh, boy.

(CLAPPING)
(SQUEAKING SOUNDS)

GWANGI: He's here.

Meechee?

Welcome!
I'm really glad you're here.


What is this place, exactly?

The secret headquarters
of the S.E.S.

The Esias?

No, no, no.
It's three letters.

Like S-E-S.

Stands for
"Smallfoot Exists, Suckas!"

KOLKA: Fleem. (CHUCKLES)

It's "Smallfoot
Evidentiary Society."

I mean, my name's got
a lot more pizzazz, but...

Wait. You're, like,
a smallfoot club?

And, hold on.

You're the leader?
(MEECHEE SIGHS)

But you're the
Stonekeeper's daughter.

Look, I love my father,

but he isn't exactly
what you would call

"open to new ideas."

Because questions
lead to knowledge.

And knowledge is power.

So you don't just believe
in the smallfoot,

you've been looking for one.

Yes. You see all the X's?

We have searched
the entire mountain

for years trying to find one.

Why are you looking for X's?

We're not looking for X's.

We're looking
for the smallfoot.

And you have seen one.

But I can't prove it.

That is where we come in.

Gwangi, show him the evidence.

(CLAPPING)
(SQUEAKING SOUNDS)

Here's your proof.

First item, smallfoot pelt.

Evidence suggests it sheds
its skin annually.

Second item, smallfoot horn.
We believe it only has one.

And then there's this.

The scroll
of invisible wisdom.

Just imagine the amazing stuff
they put on here.

A bunch of crap,
if you ask me.

This proves nothing!

Show him the last one.

It's the first piece
I ever found.

It's the thing
that started all of this.

(GASPS)
That was a trigger.

He's triggered!
GWANGI: Mmm-hmm.

MIGO: <i>Look at your small foot.</i>

You did see one.
Where did it go?

I don't know!
GWANGI: Think!

Reach into your memory!
Slap him!

No! It got whisked away
on the wind, over the clouds!

MEECHEE: <i>Which way? Up?
Sideways? Where?</i>

Down!

Did you say down?

Slap him!
GWANGI AND KOLKA: Fleem!

Down! Of course!

You know,
I have always thought

it was weird
that a mountain floats

when there's obviously

some invisible force
pulling us downward

and keeping everything
around us

from drifting off
into the sky.

Of course, this is just
a theory. (CHUCKLES)

But that's why
we haven't found one up here.

Because it's down here.
Below the clouds.

And if you want proof,
that's where we need to go.

In the nothing?


Don't call me crazy.

Yeah. Never call
a crazy guy crazy.

You want to know why
it's called the nothing?

Because there's nothing
down there!

Why do you believe that?

Because it's in the stones.

So is the one that says
there's no smallfoot.

And yet, you saw one.

Yeah. Why is there a stone

that says something
doesn't exist?

Doesn't that just prove
that it actually does?

And if one stone is wrong,
then others could be as well.

What? Other stones?

How many do you
think are wrong?

The whole robe.

Huh.

You know what? This whole
thing's insane. I'm out.

Migo, wait.

Hey, I just wanna prove
that I saw a smallfoot

so I can get un-banished.

But you, you wanna, what?

Tear down everything
our world is built on?

It's not just about
tearing down old ideas.

It's about finding new ones.


You know what, come with me.


<i>And see the world
we think we know</i>

<i>And then look closer</i>

Wow.

<i>There's more to life
than meets the eye</i>

<i>A beauty to behold</i>

<i>It's all much bigger
than we know</i>

<i>It's only just beginning
to unfold</i>

<i>So let it all unfold</i>

<i>Far beyond all reason
in your mind</i>

<i>There's a world mysterious
There for you to find</i>

<i>All these questions
that we always had</i>

<i>All we are is curious</i>

<i>There's nothing
wrong with that</i>

<i>So go 'round every corner</i>

<i>Search every part of the sky</i>

<i>'Cause a life
that's full of wonder</i>

<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

Whoo!


(MEECHEE VOCALIZES)

<i>Dig beneath the surface</i>

<i>Find the lessons
there to learn</i>

<i>And then dig deeper</i>

<i>Feed your intuition
Don't leave any stone unturned</i>

<i>Be the seeker of the truth</i>

<i>Listen when you hear it
calling you</i>

<i>You know it's calling you</i>

<i>Far beyond all reason
in your mind</i>

<i>There's a world mysterious
There for you to find</i>

<i>All these questions
that we always have</i>

<i>All we are is curious</i>

<i>There's nothing
wrong with that</i>

<i>So go 'round every corner</i>

<i>Search every part of the sky</i>

<i>'Cause a life
that's full of wonder</i>

<i>Is a wonderful life</i>


<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

<i>Is a wonderful life</i>

Down there, Migo,
a world awaits.

Okay, I'll go.

Really?
Do you have a plan?

Of course we have a plan.

Uh, I think the plan
might need more planning.

FLEEM:
It was nice knowing you!

Hey, uh, I need to readjust
the harness.

It's a little too tight.

This should be enough rope.
Should be?

We don't know exactly
how far down it is.

It's also
all the rope we have.

Okay, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do it fast.

Gwangi, tell him the plan.

Oh, boy.
GWANGI: Listen up.

Whoa!
Pull once to go lower, twice to stay put,

three times to come up.
MIGO: Uh...

Four pulls means
you've reached the bottom

and it's safe for us
to come down.

Wait, what was the second one?

Look, it doesn't really
matter. (SCREAMS) Ow.

Your safe word
is "mystical creature."

That's more
of a phrase, really.

If you shout it, we'll abort the
mission and pull you right on up.

How about just "help"?

I'll scream, "Help!"
Nice and short.

You're gonna do great.

Yeah? You really think so?

Let's do this!
(SCREAMS)



Whoa! Oh-oh.
FLEEM: Migo!

If you die, can I have
all your worldly possessions?

ALL: Fleem!
Right. Sorry, when you die.

Uh...

What do you see?

Uh, so far just seeing cloud,
and more cloud.

Wait, wait,

Oh, no!
(ALL GASP)

MIGO: Sorry,
that was just my hand.

(ALL SIGH IN RELIEF)
Okay.

MIGO: Still clouds.

More clouds
KOLKA: Uh...

MIGO: Man, there's a lot
of clouds.

THORP: Meechee, you out here?

Thorp!
(ALL EXCLAIM)

Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh"? Why "uh-oh"?

Uh-oh. Mystical creature!

Hey, what are you freaks
doing out here?

MIGO: Mystical creature!

Uh, what was that?

Uh, it's, um, the wind!
Huh?

Yeah, it makes
strange noises out here.

(ALL SHUDDERS)
(WHISPERS) Mystical creature!


(ALL SIGH)

(ALL SCREAM)


Stop it.
You're all acting weird.

I don't like weird.
Weird is weird, okay?

(MIGO GRUNTING)

I thought I heard
Migo's high-pitched,

kind of annoying voice.
Where is he?

Hanging over the...
Ah!

Honestly, we have no idea...
(FLEEM GRUNTING)

...of the status
of his whereabouts.

How many times was up?

How many times?

Something's not right here.
Let me think about this.


Ugh, something's
not adding up.

Yeah, I can't do math.

You're coming with me.

(ALL GASP)

Oh, no!

Definitely not enough rope!


(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

(STOPS SCREAMING)

(RESUMES SCREAMING)

(EXHALES DEEPLY)


Oh.

Guys?


Oh, boy.


Oh, wow.

not nothingness!

(NORMAL VOICE) This is
definitely something-ness.

(BIRD SCREECHES)

Whoa.

(GOAT BLEATING)
(GASPS)


Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

Hi, little guy!

(GOAT SCREAMS)

Oh! No!

That is just harsh!

I'll teach you
a little lesson.

Take that!

(GOAT SCREAMS)

Yes!

Run, little one!
Run, run, be free!

Oh, the shiny flying thing!


(BOTH SCREAMING)

Uh-oh. Whoa.

No. No, no, no!

Whoa. (SCREAMS)

Whoa!



Phew.




(WIND WHISTLING)



Whoa!


Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!


No! Rock! Rock!

(SCREAMS AND GRUNTS)


Whoa.


No. No, no, no.


Hmm.


Ow.



Whoo-hoo!


Ow!






Huh!

BRENDA: Okay, okay,
back up, back up.

You wanna interview a man
who says he saw a yeti?

And you actually believe him?

Of course not.
But it makes for good TV.

That man
has altitude sickness.

He needs help!
(PILOT GRUNTS)

After he helps us.
What?

Brenda, do you know what
this village is famous for?

Yetis.

More reported
yeti sightings here

than anywhere else
on the planet.

So?

Picture this.

We're here looking

for the Himalayan
jumping spider...

but we capture on film a yeti.

We post the video,
it goes viral, then boom!

My ratings skyrocket!

Yetis don't exist.

Or do they?

Picked up a suit in town
this afternoon,

and it's a cracker.

Has stilts and everything.

You're gonna put that thing on
and deceive your fans?

I'll be on camera.

You'll be in the suit.

Wow!

What has happened to you?

Where is the Percy Patterson
who loved animals,

who inspired me to love them,
who had integrity?

I have integrity.

Mmm...

Okay, yes, I've gotta do
one thing without integrity

and then I'll just be
all integrity all the time.

I will ooze integrity.

I shall bathe in it.

I will have a sports drink
called "Integrity"

that I will endorse
not for free

but I will take that money
and give it to charity.

That's how much integrity

I will have!
(SIGHS IN DISGUST)

Brenda, please.
Nobody's watching my show.

You wanna save a species
on the verge of extinction?

Save me.
(SIGHS)

(MUSIC PLAYING)
Brenda!

<i>Yo, I'm really nervous.</i>

<i>This one goes out
to my girlfriend.</i>

Brenda, wait.

Let me explain.

<i>Lisa, will you marry...</i>

<i>I thought I'd made it</i>

<i>Celebrated when
I got my TV show</i>

<i>But the haters
out there hating</i>

<i>Got my ratings low, low, low</i>

<i>It's hard to compete
with videos</i>

<i>Of twerking hogs</i>

<i>And waterskiing squirrels</i>

<i>And monkeys riding
on the backs of dogs</i>

<i>So much pressure</i>

<i>Have mercy, I'm not the Percy
That you've always heard about</i>

<i>That Percy, he was successful
That Percy had a lot of clout</i>

I was high on that hill</i>

<i>But now I'm broke here
on the bottom</i>

<i>With no way to pay my bills</i>

<i>It's getting harder every day
To catch a break</i>

<i>So when I see a chance</i>

<i>Then it's a chance
I really need to take</i>

<i>I'm just looking for a way
of bouncing back</i>

<i>The rent is due, I'm in a fix
And I'm about to crack</i>

<i>Under pressure</i>

<i>Brenda? I'm making this up
on the spot.</i>

<i>He's under pressure</i>

<i>Which is impressive,
let's be honest.</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

I'm a desperate man</i>

<i>So help me get back on the top
Of rockin' again</i>

<i>No pressure</i>

<i>Brenda, Brenda
Won't you hear my plea?</i>

<i>The weight of all the world
Is really weighing on me</i>

<i>So much pressure</i>

<i>This is no time to quit
I'm on the verge of a hit</i>

<i>And I'm determined to
make this a success Yeah</i>

<i>Brenda, tell me you see
All the potential in me</i>

<i>I'll do whatever it takes
To make you say yes</i>

<i>Down on my knees
Begging you please</i>

<i>Won't you tell me
you understand?</i>

<i>Lend me a hand</i>

<i>Oh, you gotta save me, save me
Save me, save me</i>

Those aren't even the words.

<i>You think I don't know that?
Brenda?</i>

<i>Brenda?</i>

Oh, no, no, no.
The bag! The suit!

No!

(MAN AND WOMAN SPEAKING
MANDARIN AND LAUGHING)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Whoa.


(GOAT BLEATS)
Huh?



Hey, what you got there?

Shh! It's okay.
(BLEATS)

Hmm.
(CRASHES)

(GASPS) I must be close!
(DOOR OPENS)


There it is!

I should introduce myself.
Oh, but why am I so scared?

(SPEAKS GIBBERISH)

Hmm. No language skills.

Didn't see that one coming.

Excuse me. Um...

PERCY: Brenda,
please come back.

It's just this one time,

then we'll do the whole
integrity thing.

I promise. Please call me
when you get this!

Thank you, Brenda! Oh!

You've even put on the stilts.
Oh, I love it.

And the suit does not
look fake.

It's actually
quite convincing.

Okay, here's the shot.
I'll film over...

(SPEAKS GIBBERISH)


Uh...

He's doing all the talking.
Just say something, you idiot.


Hi.
Huh?

I'm Migo and I have...


Blimey, good growl.

Did you put an amplifier
inside there or something?

This is why I work
with you, Brenda.

When you're in, you're all in.

(RECORDER BEEPS)
Okay, hair looks good.

Nice bit of back light.

(BLOWING LIPS)

Here we go, yeti
discovery shot, take one.

Percy Patterson here,

high in the Himalayas.
I was looking for the rare...


Not yet. Thank you.
Cut that bit out.

In three, two...


for the rare Himalayan
jumping spider...

but I just heard
a low growling

coming from this direction.


Is that a yeti?

Do the growl.

(MOTOR WHIRRING)

Do you mind?

Ugh. Brenda,
will you turn that off?

I'm trying to shoot Brenda
in this... Wait a minute.

Brenda?

Brenda?


It's a yeti! It's a yeti!

I can't seem to shout.

You know, you'll laugh,
because in my world

everyone thinks you're this
terrifying monster that's all.


But you don't look
terrifying to me.

(GRUNTS)
You're adorable.

(SCREAMS)
Ooh, the smallfoot song.

I know this one.
I know it. I know it.

(SCREAMS AND WHIMPERS)

Was that not right?

(PANTING AND GRUNTS)


I just need
to take you home

and prove to everyone
that you exist

so I can get un-banished.
Okay?



(SHRIEKS) -MIGO: You
wanna bring anything?

(GRUNTS)
Okay.

Ha-ha!



You wanna bring that, too?
Okay, come here.


Ooh, that looks cool!



Wait! Where you going?
Look how excited you are.

(PERCY SHRIEKS)

(SCREAMS AND GRUNTS)
(LAUGHING)

(PERCY GASPS)
Stop it! (LAUGHING)

Argh!

That's ironic.


Um...

(SNORING)
Uh...

Smallfoot? Hello?

Oh! That supposed
to fall out like that?

We need to put that
back in there.

It goes there, right?

Oh, boy.


All right, take a little
bit of that...

I hope you don't mind,
but I'm taking you home.

I'm gonna be all like,
"Yo, what's up?"

And they're gonna be like,
"Yo, is that a... What?"

And I'm gonna be like, "Yeah!"

Their faces are gonna
be like... Ahh!

Then my face is like
' "Uh-huh!"

Smallfoot exists, suckas!
Whoo-hoo!


Is that a blizzard?






Wow, that storm came out
of nowhere, didn't it?

Don't worry.
We'll wait it out in here.

It's nice and warm.

(GASPS LOUDLY) No!



Please don't die, please
don't die, please don't die.

Don't worry, smallfoot.
I'm gonna save you.

I'm gonna save you.
Just hang on!

Hang on! Hang on!
(ROCKS CLICKING)

PERCY: (SIGHS) Fire.

So warm.

So nice...

Wait a minute. What's...

(SHRIEKS AND HUFFS)

No, no, you can't...

(CHATTERING)
How's that?

Nice and toasty
all the way around.

(SHRIEKS AND CHATTERS)
Oh, hey. What's wrong?

You hungry? I found your food.

Please...

(MUFFLED GRUNT)

(CHATTERS)
You still cold?

You have, like, no fur.

Oh, your cocoon is almost dry.

I'll clear off a space where you can just
lie down until the storm passes, okay?

(PERCY GASPING)

Percy Patterson here

in what might be
my last broadcast ever.

I might get eaten or roasted
or frozen solid

or some horrible combination
of the three.

But know this...

Know that I risked my life

in pursuit of something
extraordinary.

Something bigger than us.

Literally, so much bigger.

Oh, great! You're moving. I've
almost finished clearing off...


I think he's saying he wants
to have me for dinner.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Oh, what?

you stupid frozen fingers!


There we go.

Brenda, give me my glory.

Upload this video,
then send help.

Please work, please work,
please work!

Yes!

No!


(LOW GROWL)

Something else is in here.

Judging by the echo...

I'd estimate distance
is approximately 200 meters.

Estimation wrong.



(PANTING AND GRUNTS)



(SCREAMS AND GASPS)

My husband is back there
sound asleep!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Not to mention the children!

Took me weeks
to get them to sleep!

I don't even have kids,
but I can imagine

that that is just a really
hard thing to do.

All I get is six months
of a little mommy time...

and you are ruining it!

(BOTH GROWLING)

Huh?

(BEAR GROWLING)

You just walk into my cave.
You don't even wipe your feet!

Again, very, very sorry!
You better be sorry.

I don't know what you are
or where you came from

but you better
learn some manners!

(PERCY PANTING)

Did you see that? She was all,
"You're gonna wake my husband."

And I was like,
"You gotta get out of here."

And then you totally
understood me.

We were communicating.

This is amazing!

(LAUGHS IN RELIEF)

(METAL CLANGS)
(MIGO ROARING IN PAIN)

(MIGO GROANING)

Don't be stupid, Percy.

Do not go back to help
the big, ferocious yeti.

Do not do it!

Although he did just
save you from a bear.

Argh!

This is the wrong time
to grow a conscience!

(MIGO GROANING)



Wow.

It's okay, big fella.

Let's get this thing off.

Does this hurt?
(GASPS)

PERCY: Sorry.
This? How about this?

This? This? Sorry.
(GROANING)

Stop it!
Got it.

It's okay. I'm okay.

(GAGS AND SHUDDERS)

(PERCY SPEAKING GIBBERISH)


Oh, the storm's lifted!

What do you say me and you
get up that mountain

and prove you exist?

PERCY: Hmm?

Oh, right. Hand signals.

Um...


PERCY: This is unbelievable

but I think the yeti
is actually trying

to communicate with me.

And I think he wants me
to go with him.

This is either the bravest
thing I've ever done

or the stupidest.

Here's hoping it's the former.

Oh, I almost forgot.

Here. These should
keep you warm.

No, no, no. (HUFFING)

Oh! That's actually
quite nice.

MIGO: Yeah!


Whoo-hoo!


We're almost there.


Up and at 'em, Migo.
Time to ring the gong!

so hard this morning?


Launch!

Migo?

Migo, time to ring the...

Oh, yeah. Banished.


Uh-oh.




Huh? What the...


(GONG SOUNDING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

Two gongs?


Don't ask. Just push it down.

Push it down.

My helmet?

Drop me! Quickly,
before I change my mind.

KOLKA: You can't
do this, Meech!

You're our leader!

Exactly why I should do it!

Drop me!

Okay.

This is terrifying. I cannot
believe Migo did this.

Which is why maybe, you know,

I just wanna say,
I'm fine with it being you.

I should go.

I'm strongest
and I've trained myself

to sleep with my eyes open.

I'm asleep right now.
You're all part of my dream.

He's down there
because I convinced him to go!

And he might be lost or hurt.

Or dead.
BOTH: Fleem!

Oh, what? Now we're not
about the truth?

MEECHEE: Last time, we dropped
him because Thorp showed up

which he might do again,
so can we please go?

MIGO: Guys! Guys!

MEECHEE: Oh, I can still hear
his voice in my head.

Guys!
It's in my head, too.

MIGO: Hey!

Migo! He's here!

I know. And he always will be.

No, no, no. He's here!
As in, over there!

(KOLKA GASPS)
Guys!

Migo!
Migo!


Oh, no! Ahhh!

(MEECHEE SCREAMS)
I've got you!

Oh.
Migo!

(MIGO LAUGHING)
I am so relieved!

Oh, hi!
Hey!

(CHUCKLES) Hi.
Hi.

See? I told you he was alive!
My brother!

Oh, Migo! Oh, Migo.

Whoa-whoa!
Guys, easy. Easy, easy.

PERCY: Mmm? Huh?

What is that?

Smallfoot Evidentiary Society,
meet your mystical creature!

(PERCY GRUNTING)


Huh?

(ALL GASP)


I knew it was real.

No one's gonna think
I'm crazy anymore.

He's so beautiful!

And so short.

You did it, Migo.
You actually did it!

No, we did it. The S.E.S.!

(YETIS GROWLING)
Wow! Four more Sasquatch.

It's a whole Sasquad.

(GASPS)
(LAUGHS)

Fear me, little creature.
I am your god!

Fleem, what are you doing?
Establishing dominance.

KOLKA: No.
(PERCY SCREAMS)

We don't dominate.
We welcome him with open arms.

(PERCY SCREAMS)
Oh, did I just do that?

(GRUNTS)
I am so sorry!

Are you okay? Are you hurt?

I'm so sorry. I love you.
I love you.

We gotta bring this truth
to the village,

blow some tiny minds.

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)
What was that?

Their minds are really tiny.
Ah!

Gwangi's right.

Let's wake them up.


What? Migo's back?

(ALL GASPING)

Yeah, that's right.
In your face!

Oh! My face!

Hey, listen! Everyone!

Stop what you're doing
and follow us!

'Cause this is gonna be
the best part of your day!

GWANGI: You heard Migo.
Everybody.

MIGO: That's right!
Migo?

MIGO: Hey, you up there!
Come on down!

GWANGI: Come on, kids.

You, too, Garry.
Get over here.

MIGO: Let's go!
You're gonna love it!

Hey, Migo, welcome back...

Hold on, aren't you supposed
to be banished?

MIGO: Yep.
Ah, cool.

Everyone, listen up.
Gather 'round.

I promise, you're gonna
wanna see this.

(CLEARS THROAT)
My fellow yetis,

there are moments in life

that are imbued
with such importance.

We must pause
and look deeper

into the moment
of the place in which we are.

To hold such
beauteous gravitas

and take in the beauty...

YETI 1: I'm losing interest!
YETI 2: Get to the point!

Yep, okay. Here we go.

Fellow yetis,
behold, the smallfoot!

(ALL GASPING)

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)
GWANGI: Mmm-hmm.

I can't believe my eyes.

These aren't primitive beasts
living in caves.

This is a complex
civilization.

Do you know what this means
for the world?

A Percy Patterson
network special.

You're welcome, world!

STONEKEEPER: So...
(ALL GASP)


What's all the excitement
about this time?

Migo found a smallfoot!


But, Dad,
look at the small foot!

Hmm?

Don't yaks have small feet?
(SIGHS)

Let me take it
into the palace,

consult the stones

and determine what it is.

it is a smallfoot?

Does that mean
a stone is wrong?

GWANGI: (COUGHS)
They're all wrong.

(COUGHING)
Yeah.

(ALL GASP)

Garry, just breathe.

Everyone, please.

What do the stones
tell us about questions?

(ALL INHALE)

(STONEKEEPER EXHALES)

(ALL CLAMORING)

I have so many questions!

Where is it from?
Why is it pink?

How did you get it here?
What does it eat?

How does it think
with such a tiny little brain?

Honestly, I have just as many
questions as you do.

Where is its horn?
Is that its ear?

Does it want a bite of fruit?

How is it here if a stone
says it can't be?

than we know</i>

How?
Why?

What do you mean?

<i>It's only just beginning
to unfold</i>

I'm so confused.
There's more to know?

<i>So let it all unfold</i>

<i>I never knew
there was more to know</i>

<i>Isn't it all so amazing?</i>

<i>There's a world mysterious
There for you to find</i>

<i>Out of the blue,
there was room to grow</i>

<i>Isn't it all kind of crazy?</i>

<i>All we are is curious</i>

<i>There's nothing wrong
with that</i>

<i>So go 'round every corner</i>

You call that art?

<i>Search every part of the sky</i>

What is he doing?
Is he really gonna fly?

<i>'Cause a life
that's full of wonder</i>

<i>Is a wonderful life</i>


PERCY: Whoo!


Argh!
(MEECHEE GRUNTING)



(ALL LAUGHING)



Blossom, sit.
I got you.

Down. Down!


(BOTH LAUGH)

(CAMERA CLICKING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

STONEKEEPER: Do you see
what you've started?

MEECHEE: Yes! Do you?

Look at them!

We have been living in fear
for too long, Dad.

All I ever wanted to do
was keep you safe, Meechee.

Everything I do, I do to
protect the village. And you.

I don't need you
to protect me,

I need you to listen to me.

To all of us!

Especially Migo!

Dad, he went below the clouds.

They're talking to Migo because they
have questions and he's listening,

instead of telling them
to just push them down.

But, believe me,
you are their leader,

and they wish it was you.

So, just talk to Migo
about what he saw.

Please.

You're right. That's exactly
what I need to do.

Oh, thank you!
I knew you'd come around.

I'm gonna go get
the smallfoot! Bye!

That's a snood.
It's like a sort of scarf.

That's a fiber supplement.
I'd rather not go into it.

That's a sock.

It's a lining between
your shoe and your foot.

That's not how
you're supposed... Ugh.

Four days I had them on.
(CHILDREN GIGGLING)

Can you translate the Scroll
of Invisible Wisdom?

Ah...

Yes. Actually, I do need this.

Okay.

Ugh!

(GARY WHIMPERING)
It is not wisdom

and definitely not invisible.

GWANGI: Hmm.
Hey, where's Migo?

MIGO: Hey, Dad! Dad!

Oh, is this the best day ever
or what?

Dad?

What's wrong?
What happened to your helmet?

I missed the gong.

But the sky snail,
it came up anyway.

Whoa.
So another stone is wrong.

This is amazing.
DORGLE: Amazing?

What's so amazing about it?

The stones are supposed
to be stones, you know?

Sturdy, reliable, true.

And now the snail
is just rising on its own?

If it even is a snail.

Meechee thinks it might be
a flaming ball of gas.

Gas?

I've been banging my head
on that thing

to wake up a gas ball?

That's usually
what wakes me up.

all of this change is scary.

But maybe
this is a good thing.

Maybe there's something
even better

than banging your head
against the gong.

But if I don't ring the gong,
I'm not the gong ringer.

And if I'm not
the gong ringer

then what am I?

THORP: Hey, Migo!

My dad wants to see you.

MIGO: The Stonekeeper. Really?

Which must be nice for you,

'cause he never wants
to see me. (SCOFFS)

MIGO: Okay.

Why did I shout that out?
That's so embarrassing.

Ugh. Blew it again, Thorp.

Hey, Dad. I'll be back.

Dad?
Hmm.

Look at them.

The great Stonekeepers
of the past.

Each one adding new stones

as they received wisdom about
what was best for the village.

Robe looks heavy.
It is.

It requires a strong backbone.




Whoa. Secret stairs. Okay.

Um...

Where are you taking me?


Think it's about time
I give you some answers.

Whoa!

What is this?

You see, Migo...


<i>When yetis lived
beneath the clouds</i>

<i>We were alive
And we were thrivin'</i>

<i>Till we came across a crowd
Of smallfoot</i>

<i>That's right, we used to live
Down there</i>

<i>But there were actions</i>

<i>We could not forgive
Down there</i>

<i>And though they used
a different nomenclature</i>

<i>Man or human
They showed us human nature</i>

<i>A dangerous species</i>

<i>Though we approached
with wonder</i>

<i>They attacked
with their spears</i>

<i>And their smoking
sticks of thunder</i>

<i>They called us Sasquatch
They called us abominable</i>

<i>They chased us, pursued us
Their persistence indomitable</i>

<i>We had no choice
but to run and hide</i>

<i>Otherwise, we surmised
We were facing genocide</i>

<i>So we climbed this mountain
Just to stay alive</i>

<i>You see, we knew that up here
Smallfoot could not survive</i>

<i>So it was here the first law
Was written in stone</i>

<i>It was named and proclaimed
As a truth to be known</i>

<i>Our world is an island</i>

<i>That floats on a sea
Of endless clouds</i>

<i>That's how it would be</i>

<i>And then we wrote more laws
More rules to obey</i>

<i>For the sake of us all
It was the only way</i>

<i>To protect us from all
Of the human ravages</i>

<i>Heaped upon us
By those human savages</i>

FEMALE CHORUS: <i>Now you know
Now you know, now you know</i>

<i>Now you know, now you know</i>

<i>And new rules apply</i>

<i>Now you know, now you know
Now you know</i>

MALE CHORUS:
<i>That it's best just</i>

<i>To let it lie, let it lie</i>

FEMALE CHORUS: <i>Now you know
Now you know, now you know</i>

<i>Now you know, now you know</i>

<i>And you can't deny</i>

<i>Now you know, now you know
Now you know</i>

<i>That it's best just
To let it lie, let it lie</i>

But my smallfoot,
he's not like that.

They're all like that.

Tell me, when you found him,

did he greet you
with open arms?


STONEKEEPER:
They don't care about us.

They don't care about anything
but themselves.

Which is why
we must do the same.

If we care about our future.


MIGO: We're below the clouds.

STONEKEEPER: Or so it would
seem, but look closer.

Those aren't clouds!
It's steam.

The stones are working.

The stones?

STONEKEEPER: (RAPPING)
<i>Every job and every task</i>

<i>As pointless as it seems</i>

<i>All of it ensures
that this important machine</i>

<i>Keeps churning and turning
And spinning around</i>

<i>So those below don't look up</i>

<i>And those above
don't look down</i>

<i>And they'll look</i>

<i>'Cause even if they hear
of these atrocities</i>

<i>The only thing
Stronger than fear</i>

<i>Is curiosity</i>

FEMALE CHORUS: <i>Now you know
Now you know, now you know</i>

Wait, so none of those stones
are true? They're all lies?

<i>Let it lie</i>

Good lies.
To protect our world.

But they need
to know the truth.

Oh, do they?

By your noble quest</i>

<i>To find the truth</i>

<i>I chalk it up to the naive
innocence of youth</i>

<i>So let me share a secret
That you'll learn</i>

<i>As you grow older</i>

<i>What's true or not true
Is in the eye of the beholder</i>

<i>So do you wanna prevent
our own annihilation?</i>

Yes!

<i>Then our only goal should be</i>

<i>To control the flow
of information</i>

<i>Unless you want
To see the smallfoot</i>

<i>Conquer and pillage</i>

No!

<i>Then protect the lie
And you protect the village</i>

Lives are at stake, Migo.

Your friends, your father,
Meechee.

Okay. I want to know
everything there is to know

about you and your world.

STONEKEEPER: <i>She's curious.</i>

And you know what they say.
"Curiosity killed the yak."

So what do you want me to do?

Tell everyone you were lying
about the smallfoot.

But they've already seen it.

They're not gonna believe me.

You'd be surprised
at what they'll believe.

You think knowledge
is power, Migo?

FEMALE CHORUS: <i>Now you know
Now you know, now you know</i>

<i>Now you know, now you know</i>

Question is...

FEMALE CHORUS: <i>Now you know
Now you know, now you know</i>

...what are you gonna do
with that power?

(CHORUS HUMMING)

MEECHEE:
<i>Okay. It's a little fuzzy,</i>

but I think I'm starting
to get it.

Your job is to tell stories
that fly through the air

in a series of pictures
in rapid succession

that magically appear
in other smallfoots' homes.


TV. Right!

And what is this thing here?

That's the roof of my home.

Home.
Home?

(SPEAKS GIBBERISH)
(GROWLS)

Are we saying the same thing?

(SPEAKS GIBBERISH)
(GROWLS)

Oh, is that, like,
your best friend?

That is evil banker man.

He wants to take
my home away

because of something called
a "variable interest rate."

(GROWLS QUESTIONINGLY)

Apparently, I don't know what
it means either. (CHUCKLES)

thin up here, isn't it?


Those are animals.

(TRUMPETS)
(SHRIEKS)

(BOTH LAUGHING)

(MAMMOTH GROWLING)

Cheeky.

Anyway, the point is, this
is why I do what I do, see?

I was fascinated
with other species, like you.

Actually, nothing like you.
You're quite extraordinary.

But lately,
I started to only care

about how many people
are watching.

How popular I am.

Wow.

Hearing myself
say this out loud...

What's the yeti word
for "pathetic"?

When I was nine,
I saw my first lion.

It looked like this, see?


It looked nothing like this.
That looks like a fat poodle.

Here, I'll just show you.


Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Okay. What is that thing?

STONEKEEPER:
<i>They don't care about us.</i>

<i>Lives are at stake, Migo.</i>

<i>They don't care about anything
but themselves.</i>

<i>Good lies.</i>

<i>Which is why we must do
the same. Protect our world.</i>

<i>Your friends, your father,
Meechee.</i> (ECHOING)

MEECHEE: No, don't do that.

What are you doing?
You're ruining it!

Stop! Stop it!

Red one up! Up, up!
Now, over to the blue one.

Blue one. Three in a row! Yes!

Meechee?
Not now, Migo.

Ooh! Okay, down, down.
Right side. Purple thingy.

Slide it, slide it.
(EXHALES)

Oh! There we go! Boom!

Ha-ha! Whoo!

Migo, I'm putting shapes
next to other shapes

to make the rows disappear.

It's pointless
and a total waste of time,

but I can't stop.

There goes our high score.

Smallfoot?

Hey, are you okay?

(SPEAKS GIBBERISH)

PERCY: Getting a little woozy.

some more oxygen. Oxygen.

I can't remember my own name.

(PERCY SPEAKING GIBBERISH)
MIGO: Um...

What's all this?

Oh, uh, we learned
how to communicate!

That's his world...
(GASPS)

...and I think it's really big

and there are more smallfeet
down there.

Like, a lot more.

Migo, I think
something's wrong.

He doesn't look so good.
(BREATH TREMBLING)

He's cold
and his breathing is off.

STONEKEEPER: <i>You see,
we knew that up here,</i>

<i>smallfoot could not survive.</i>

MEECHEE: I think we need
to take him home.

What? No!

No? Why not?

What if he's really sick?
What if he needs help?

Just stop asking questions!

Stop asking questions?

(HORN BLOWING)

THORP: Attention, everyone!

The Stonekeeper
has an announcement.

What's going on? Do you know?

'Cause you look
like you know something.

Just stop. Please.

STONEKEEPER:
Well, well, well,

what an interesting day
it's been.

A day full of excitement
and questions.

So many questions.

I must admit,
the events of the day

even had me asking a few.

(ALL GASP)
Uh-oh, I smell cover-up.

So I asked Migo to join me

so I could question him
about his amazing discovery.

And together, we've reached
the same conclusion.

Migo, tell them
what we learned.

Yeah. Um...

(LABORED GASPING)

(DISTORTED GROWL)

The thing is, see... Uh...

Yeah, it's, uh...

What I was gonna
tell you is, um...

(INDISTINCT SCREAMS)
Uh...

It's not a smallfoot.

(ALL GASPING)
(LAUGHS) Wait. What?

Yeah. I was wrong,
I got confused,

and the Stonekeeper
figured it out.

It's actually a type of yak.

A yak?
(SCOFFS)

STONEKEEPER:
Migo found a rare breed that

even I didn't know about.
No...

A red-coated
pygmy hairless yak.

You know this is not a yak.

As you can see,
its existence is confirmed

in stone.

(ALL GASPING)

What is happening?

The stones have protected us
for generations.

But we've been ignoring them.

No one's been feeding

the great
mountain mammoths today.

(ALL GASP)
MALE YETI: He's right.

And because of that,
we are sinking.


Garry, you're right
to be afraid.

Everyone,
listen to Garry.

(ALL GASPING)

I don't wanna sink
into the nothing!

These are lies, Migo.

We saw you
go below the clouds.

I didn't.
I fell into the clouds

and I found him
inside of a cave.

What?
(ALL GASPING)

Don't listen to him.

This is all part of
a massive cover-up!

MIGO: Please, just...

We're all part of
a big machine.

Dude, no. Come on, stop!

In fact, I think it might be
a big machine

that's down there!
You need to stop!

It does sound like a machine!
I thought so, too!

You heard me!
Just stop!

(ALL GASP)

A big machine. (LAUGHS)

Right!

Let's all listen to Gwangi
and his whacked-out theories

because we all know
that Gwangi is

just straight-up crazy.
(GASPS)

What?
Don't call him crazy.

Come on, are we really
gonna listen to these guys?

They're the village weirdos,
right?

We all know that.

They're just trying to prove
all the stones wrong.

But if we don't follow
the stones,

really bad things can happen.

(ALL GASP)

STONEKEEPER: Well said, Migo.
That's the truth.

The truth?

I don't think anybody around
here cares what that is.


Migo, give him to me.

MIGO: Wait,
what are you doing?

(YETIS MURMURING)

No, no, no! He need warmth
and he can't breathe!

Meechee.

Why are you doing this?

This is something
we should discuss inside.

Inside.

Yes, Father.

Meechee, we need to talk.

I think you've said enough.

STONEKEEPER: Okay, everyone.

Now everything can go back
to the way it was.

Everyone, back to work.
The village won't run itself.

The smallfoot, what are you
gonna do with him?

We're taking him back to
the cave where you found him.

But I didn't find him
in a cave.

But you said you did,
so they believe you.

You've done a good thing,
Migo.

Stonekeeper, wait!

No!

STONEKEEPER:
You've done your job, Migo.

Go home.




(CRACKING JOINTS, EXHALES)


Migo?

What's wrong?
What are you doing?

about Stone 15.

Uh...

"Ignorance is bliss"?

Yeah. That one's true.

Ignorance is bliss.

Or at least it was.

I was pretty happy

when I didn't know
about the smallfoot.

Or the S.E.S.

Or how amazing
Meechee really is.

And I'm pretty sure
I'd be happier

not knowing that they hate me.

Or that I lied
and betrayed them all.


I miss being ignorant.

So let's just, you know,

go back to the way
things were.

With one change.

I'll be the gong ringer
from now on.

Maybe banging my head
into that thing

will make all of these
feelings go away.

Oh, yeah.
You'll pretty much go numb.

You won't feel a thing.

Good. Because I feel like
such a jerk.

Okay.

Now, you remember
the advice I gave you, right?

First, check the wind.

Pretty easy
to get blown off course.

Wind, check.

And you gotta true your aim.

You'll never succeed
if your aim isn't true.

Aim, check.

And don't forget,

even though you know
it's gonna hurt,

you gotta hit it head-on.

(GASPS SOFTLY)

Um...
He's in there.

She's in there.

But...

DORGLE: You already woke
the village, son.

Now, go make sure
they stay awake.

I love you, Dad.

I love you, too, son.

Now, say the word.

Launch!

Whoo!



(MAMMOTH GRUNTS)
Ow!

Meechee, I am so sor...

Oh, no.

Meechee?
(GASPS)

What are you doing here?

Meechee.

Where's the smallfoot?

(LABORED PANTING)

Hold on, little guy, okay?
You're almost home.

Wow.

Yeah, uh, so Meechee
took the smallfoot.


And, uh, convinced me
I have a lot of anger issues

because of something
called a father complex.

I don't know, something about

not getting enough hugs
as a kid.

Really doing some serious
processing right now, Dad.

What have I done?

Open the door!


Guys!

Guys! You have to help me!

Meechee's taken the smallfoot
below the clouds!

Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.

I can explain everything.
After we find Meechee.

She's in danger.
You have to believe me!

Why should we believe you?
You lied.

Friends don't do that.

Or stab you in the back
and call you crazy

in front of the whole village.

You acted like me.
I expect more from you.

You're right. I lied.


You know, you've always
searched for the truth.

No matter what anybody said.

They laughed at you,
they called you names.

Wait. What names?

But you never let fear
get in the way.

That's what
I should have done.

And it's what
I'm gonna do now.

(SCREAMING)
ALL: Migo!

FLEEM: Wait! What names?

(MIGO CONTINUES SCREAMING)


(MIGO GRUNTS)


Oh, Meechee, where are you?

(DISTANT SCREAMING)
(GASPS)

Huh?


(KOLKA GRUNTING)

Kolka!
Hi!

Hi! Wait.
If you're here, that means...

(SCREAMING)
(BOTH SCREAM)

Man! That is
a long way down!

(BOTH GRUNT)

Guys!

(ALL PANTING)

You came!

Of course we came.
For Meechee.


Yeah. Yeah, I know.

And a little bit for you.
But mostly Meechee.

Thank you. Even you, Fleem.

Wait, where's Fleem?

Okay, pros and cons.

Pro, Migo needs you.

Con, you're useless to him
if you're dead.


Cons, one, pros, zero.
Okay. Pro.

Yeah, Fleem sucks.

We can't wait.
We have to find Meechee

right now
before someone else does.

Wow.

It's so big.

How do we even know
she landed here?

(MIGO CLEARS THROAT)

Oh.

MEECHEE: Okay, little guy.

You can breathe easy now.
(PERCY SIGHS)

You're home. See?

Home.

What is that?


Wait, where am I?

Huh?

What?

Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

(YELPS, GRUNTS)

Okay.

Brenda?
Percy?

(PERCY SCREAMING)
(GASPS)

Ow!

Percy! You're alive!

(PERCY GROANS)
You're alive!

Oh, my gosh,
you are alive, aren't you?

Not dead. Raring to go.

PERCY: (ON TV)
<i>...know that I risked my life</i>

<i>in pursuit of
something extraordinary.</i>

<i>Something bigger than us.</i>

My video.

I uploaded it
like you told me to

and it went totally viral!

It was real, right?
I mean, I have the suit.

You found a yeti.

My phone has been ringing
like crazy.

Everyone wants you.

Haven't you checked
your messages?

PERCY: (ON TV)
<i>...my life in pursuit</i>

<i>of something extraordinary.</i>

AGENT: <i>Percy, my favorite client! It's
your agent. I want you back. Call me.</i>

<i>This is Mark Birden</i>

<i>I saw your video.</i>

(VOICEMAILS CONTINUE PLAYING

<i>Percy,
it's Gayle at the network.</i>

<i>I saw your video!</i>

<i>If you can
get that yeti alive,</i>

<i>you and your show are saved!</i>


BRENDA: This is
everything you wanted.

(FOOTSTEPS THUDDING)

Wait, the yeti is here?

I can't believe
what I'm looking at.

This is incredible!

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Ooh!

MAN: Huh?

What is that?

So pretty.
(GIRL GIGGLING)

Oh, my gosh, a baby smallfoot!

You are so cute!

Ooh!

Wow, you are so limber!


Wait, you're not real,
are you?

Ooh!

Super pointy.

Oh, it's so pretty. (GASPS)

Another smallfoot!
(GASPS)

How many of you are there?

Oh. A lot.
(PEOPLE GASPING)

Hi.

(HORN BLARES)

(GASPS) Wow! Those are fast.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)


(WOMAN SPEAKS MANDARIN)
(BOTH SCREAM)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

Guys, I've looked everywhere.
Meechee's not here.

Yeah, I think I found her.

Oh, this is amazing!

(SIRENS BLARING)

Oh!

Oh! Uh... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

Hey... Oh!

Oh, no, no, no.

Okay, that's really bright.

Oh! Hey! Ow!

What is going on?


(PEOPLE SCREAMING)


Why are you doing this?

(SIRENS WAILING)



Meechee! We're here.
It's okay.


Actually, it's not okay,
we're in the worst place ever.

But we're together!

Yes.
Yay!

Wait, where's Fleem?

Oh, this is torture!

Fleem's pathetic.
Yeah.

Are you hurt?
I'm okay.

But why did they just
turn on me like that?

Because they're
terrible creatures.

You! Why are you here?

You're angry.
You think?

Meechee, I'm so, so sorry.

But believe me, I said
what I said to protect you.

Protect me? By lying?

She's got a point there, Migo.

Haven't you been lying
to your dad,

secret leader of the S.E.S.?

He's got a point there, Meech.

This is completely different.

Besides, what did you think

you were protecting me
from anyway?

From that.

This is what your dad
showed me.

This is why I lied.

They're monsters.

No, they think we're monsters.

Guys, guys! Psst!
They're getting closer.

(SIRENS BLARING)

They're gonna find us.
What are we gonna do?

We gotta go. Now.

Are they really all bad?

I don't know.

But we can't wait around here
to find out.

(BANGING ON DOOR)
(OFFICERS GRUNTING)

(PEOPLE GROANING)

(ALL PANTING AND GRUNTING)

(OFFICER SHOUTS

Where are they?

I swear they came this way.

Whoa! Found them!
(SIRENS WAILING)

BRENDA: Oh, no!
Where are you going?

They're not gonna get 'em
before I do!

Percy!

MIGO: Let's go. Come on.
(ALL GRUNTING)

Getting down here was easier.

(ALL PANTING)


Oh, no! Migo, we're trapped!

Stay out of the light!


ALL: Huh?

(STONEKEEPER GRUNTING)

(ALL GASPING)

The whole robe.

(PILOT SCREAMING)

(GRUNTS WOOZILY)

I told you the stones
were here to protect us.

Daddy!

STONEKEEPER: Meechee!

You came for me.

Of course I came. I listened.

Thank you.


GWANGI: What are those things?


Whoa!

Migo, come on! We can make it.

Go!

What are you doing?

We can't let them
follow us home.

Migo!
Just go!

No!

Here I am! Come and get me!

(ENGINE REVS)
(GRUNTS)





(GWANGI GRUNTS)

Gwangi, come on! Gotta hurry.


(EXHALES, GASPS)

(PERCY PANTING)

Friends, right?

I hope you understand
why I have to do this.

No!

(MIGO ROARING)

Oh, no! They got him!

Meechee!
MEECHEE: Migo!

(STRAINED GROANING)


(OFFICER SHOUTS IN MANDARIN)

There!

(OFFICER SPEAKING MANDARIN)


No!

Oh, darn! You got me.

OFFICER 1: (IN ENGLISH) <i>Do you
think this is some kind of joke?</i>

That depends.
Did you think it was funny?

Just a publicity stunt
for ratings.

Loser.
(CROWD MUTTERING)

That's not Migo!
So, where's Migo?

MIGO: (SLURRING) He shot me.

ALL: Migo!
You smallfoot shot me.

I can't feel my face!

Wait, so he is bad?

No, no, he's not bad.

I think he shot me to save me.

Yeah. You're right. He did.

He saved all of us.

Well, there goes my fame.

Yeah. But you have
something better. Integrity.

Huh.
Where was that hiding?

Thank you, Brenda.

OFFICER 2: <i>You're under arrest
for disturbing the peace,</i>

<i>destruction
of public property,</i>

<i>discharging fireworks
within the city limits...</i>

PERCY: Wait. Hang on.

<i>...Internet fraud, loitering,</i>

<i>looking weird.</i>

(OFFICER 3 SPEAKING MANDARIN)

I love that little guy.
I love you guys, too.

And you are so awesome
and smart,

and I'm meet you. I mish you.

I mush you.


I mush you, too, Migo.
Mmm.

Okay, everyone, let's go home.

(MIGO GRUNTS)

(MIGO CHUCKLES)

(FLEEM SCREAMING)



Okay, what'd I miss?

(GWANGI SCOFFS)

MIGO: This is our history.
And these are our ancestors.

There was a time when yetis

lived beneath the clouds.
(ALL GASP)

We came up here

where the smallfoot
couldn't survive.

You see, I thought
the smallfoot was my enemy.

And then he saved me.

And I know that I said
it wasn't a smallfoot,

but that wasn't true.

And I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

The smallfoot is real,

and they live
below the clouds.

Clouds we make.

(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

And this is why our ancestors
decided to do that.

(ALL GASPING)

That's the truth. See?

It's complicated,
and it can be scary,

but it's better than
living a lie.

Like, way better.

(GWANGI GRUNTS SOFTLY)

So we didn't fall

out of the butt
of the great sky yak?

Probably not.

Whose butt did we fall out of?

You know what, we'll circle back.
Got it.

So, now you know.

We think they're monsters,
and they think we are.

And that is not gonna change
by us hiding.

We have to communicate.

So, it's up to us to decide
what we wanna do.

(ALL MURMURING)


Oh, yeah!

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

CYN: (SINGING) <i>It's time

<i>Celebrate all the ways

<i>I am optimistic
Yes, I do believe</i>

<i>We have the power to make

<i>But if it's ever gonna change</i>

<i>We gotta come together,
me and you</i>

<i>In a mo-oh-oh, oh-oh

(CYN VOCALIZING)

I'm not crazy!

Mmm-hmm.

(CYN VOCALIZING)
