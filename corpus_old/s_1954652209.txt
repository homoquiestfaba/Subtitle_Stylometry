<i>So as this journey comes to an end
and you begin your next,</i>

<i>Know that you were meant
for greatness and for good.</i>

<i>It won't be easy,
and certainly not quick;</i>

<i>it may take you
your entire life to fulfill</i>

<i>what it is that
you are meant to do.</i>

<i>But every step
will put you closer.</i>

<i>Every experience will
prepare you for the next.</i>

<i>Every failure will lead you
to your success.</i>

<i>You will be tested
in ways you can't imagine.</i>

<i>But I have confidence
that you will prevail,</i>

<i>that you will see
your dreams come to fruition,</i>

<i>and that you
will leave your mark,</i>

<i>your legacy on this world.</i>

<i>Congratulations
to the class of 2012,</i>

<i>the generation
of world-changers.</i>

<i>This is how college goes.</i>

<i>Freshmen year, you're
psyched to be away from home</i>

<i>and independent
for the first time.</i>

<i>Sophomore year,
you figure it's your second year</i>

<i>so you better
settle on a major.</i>

<i>Or not.</i>

<i>Junior year,
eye on the prize.</i>

<i>Your dreams
start to take shape.</i>

Maybe you even
meet somebody.

<i>Senior year,
you can't wait to graduate</i>

<i>because you're ready to go
out there and change the world.</i>

<i>Or, at least
go on to grad school.</i>

<i>And that's how college goes.</i>

<i>Unless you're me.</i>

Stop it, lots of people
take 5 years.

Smile.

Nice.

Ooh, hey guys, come on.

Dad, Catherine and Ryder
need to be in the picture.

All hail her highness,
the Valedictorian.

<i>I'm here to merely serve.</i>

Ah, good one.

Ooh, really?

Hey, congratulations
all of you.

Glad all of you made it.

Miracles still
happen, I see.

Professor,
any words of wisdom for us

on this auspicious occasion?

God has a purpose
for all of you.

Some of you see it clearly,
some of you don't yet.

But just go out there
and seek him.

<i>You'll find it.</i>

Hop up there, professor.

<i>One more picture, come on.</i>

One more, that's it.

<i>Smile everybody!</i>

<i>It was our time.</i>

<i>The whole world
was ahead of us.</i>

At that moment,
we never would have believed

<i>that one of us wouldn't
make it through the year.</i>

Okay, you two have been
married for months now.

Isn't it time you stopped
staring at each other?

Not a chance.

Hey, at least you
don't have to live with 'em.

Yeah, that's
gotta be awkward.

Listen, you all
will be as happy someday.

And Ethan could
have his own girlfriend

if he wasn't so Ethanish.

<i>Did you
break up with Holly?</i>

It's true.

<i>Oh, why?
She was great.</i>

Nah, I saw this, like,
clingy look in her eye.

What does that
even look like?

Kind of like this...

Stop it,
that's so creepy.

Cut it out.

Okay, why did
you call us all here?

I wanna buy
the next round of lattes

because I am the new social
media coordinator for Mogul.

<i>I start next week.</i>

Congrats, man.
That's perfect for you.

<i>It's not as high up
the ladder as Miss Catherine,</i>

most esteemed
investment manager.

You've got to
start somewhere, my boy.

I agree.
Keep at it, you'll make it.

I thought you were gonna take
that cool non-profit job

where they give away shoes
every time someone buys a pair.

It didn't come
with a company car, so-

You got a car?

I just thought there
was further to go

with an investment company.

You know, with
more ladder to climb.

Nice.

Besides, somebody has
to make a difference

in the corporate world.

<i>Fifteen minutes, Ethan.</i>

So AlÃ©, are you gonna tell them
your good news, as well?

Are you pregnant?
No, no, no.

Actually, AlÃ© and I have
been offered positions

with Embrace a Village.

What's that?

It's an organization that serves
leprosy colonies in India.

I am sorry,
did you just say "India"?

Did you just say
"leprosy"?

I mean, I didn't even know
that still existed.

Is that safe?

Oh yeah, it's totally
curable and preventable,

as long as you have
the right medicines on-hand.

The problem is,
most people don't get the help

that they need because of
the shame that's associated

<i>with the disease.</i>

People with leprosy
and their whole families

are just cast out
of society.

Yeah, the organization
works hard to catch it early

<i>and to keep up with
the medical needs,</i>

<i>but also to help them
experience a spiritual healing.</i>

We're gonna be working
with children in a home setting.

You guys look
absolutely inspired.

Yeah, we feel like
this is the call

that God's been placing
on our lives for years.

It makes sense now.

I mean, intercultural
communications grads

with hearts for God.

Congrats, guys.

When do you-
When do you go?

Oh, 3 weeks.
Three weeks.

Three weeks?!

So Ryder, it looks like
I'm gonna need a new roomie.

Well, my attempts
to spare Catherine

the despair of singlehood
have failed, so-

Though,
I appreciate your pity.

Absolutely, man.

Cool, 'cause there is no way
I'm moving back in with my dad.

Ethan, let's go.

I'll get the lattes, yeah?

<i>Be good.</i>

<i>Catherine, it's Ryder.</i>

You free for lunch?

You could see my office.

I have an amazing
view of a hallway.

And there is this Thai
restaurant rig ht around-

<i>I'm sorry, I can't today, Ry.</i>

I'm just--
I'm so busy.

It's my first presentation
with the big wigs, you know?

I'm sure your
office is great.

-It's cool.
-Can I call you back later?

I'll catch you later.
Okay, alright, bye.

Okay.

<i>If you want good Thai,
I can show you a better place.</i>

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm new around here.

I'm Whitney.

I work in IT, and the director
asked me to loop in with you

about all these tech updates
you're proposing.

I'm Ryder.

Oh, well, you've got
a lot of ideas, Ryder.

That's why they hired me.

Mogul's been a little slow
about adopting social media,

or media at all really,
so you should just know

the upper ranks are
a little old-school.

That's why they hired me.

Hey Catherine.
Hey Margo.

Hey, I was wondering,
have you guys ever had

any problems
with clients here?

Like, anybody freaking out or
showing up angry or anything?

Oh, you mean that
Investment West thing?

Yeah, somebody
just told me about that.

Oh, well, you never know what
people are capable of doing.

Oh, and I'm so sorry,
Catherine.

Mr. Rowley has rewritten
some of your report,

and he just wants me
to pass out the new ones.

Oh, um...
Oh, okay.

Well, do you know
what changes he made?

I mean, should I take a look
at these before I present?

I don't like to say
anything bad about anybody.

Oh Catherine, you are a
very sweet girl, and religious,

and I think you should
just stop worrying about

your crazy clients.

I think you ought
to start worrying about-

<i>Good, you
got the new reports.</i>

Let's get these
old ones off the table.

Catherine, Catherine,
you'll sit over there.

Not at the table?
What about my presentation?

I'll handle it.

<i>You just observe
and don't say anything.</i>

But sir, I have some
really good ideas as to how-

No, no you don't.
You don't have any ideas.

Don't say a word.

Are we clear?

Where do you want me to take that?

Donate it.
We don't need it anymore.

Just take it.

Oh, and there's
my new roomie now.

Hey, everybody.

Okay, so the flowery teacups,
those are gonna go away, right?

Because I'm gonna
need some room

for my collector's edition
Star Wars drinkware.

Those were Mom's.

We'll wait 'til she moves out
before we move in the pool table

and the cool neon signs.

Nice, stay classy, guys.
-What does that mean?

<i>Oh hey.</i>

Taking the investment world
by storm yet?

Not quite yet.

<i>Well, I have secured
a very large cubicle</i>

and charmed the IT department,
all in one day.

I bet you have.
-I have.

What is this?

Oh, we have
to show you guys this.

This is from Joe and Pat, the
founders of Embrace a Village.

Oooh.

How cool is this, look.

Wow.

<i>That's pretty.</i>

Dude, is that a dress?

No, it's a kurta.

Kurta.
Yeah.

Ooh, and look at this.
Oh, you're gonna love this.

<i>It's a bedspread!</i>

It's a curtain.

No, it's a sari.

And you wear it like this...

<i>Kind of beautiful.</i>

I know it'll be
just the guys here,

but that just--
that doesn't look rig ht.

Let's get to the send-off before 1 get emotional.

What send-off?

Oh, Dad's got a cool
surprise for you two.

We're not dressed
for anything.

<i>Oh, sari...</i>

I thought that
was kind of bad.

<i>Alright son, are
you ready for this?</i>

<i>Alright son, are
you ready for this?</i>

Been born ready.

Literally popped out with
a passport in my hand.

I am so proud of you.

Take good care
of my little girl, alright?

You know I will.

Hi.

Every body, could we gather
around Luke and AlÃ©, please?

<i>We love you both
so much.</i>

And we're gonna
miss you terribly.

I mean, I still
can't believe that-

Sorry.

Ethan,
do you wanna take over?

<i>Sorry.</i>

Well, Ryder's got the big mouth.
He should make the speech.

Go Ryder.
Get up there.

Luke and AlÃ©!

We send you off with our love,
support, and our prayers.

<i>You know,
not a for of people</i>

have the guts
or the determination

to follow God into hard
places, but you guys--

I mean, you dreamt it
and now you're gonna live it.

This is your time.

To Luke and AlÃ©!

<i>Alright, Professor Callahan,</i>

you prayed us through
a lot during college.

How 'bout
one more time?

Okay.

Thanks for coming.
Good to see ya.

<i>Put
your hands on these kids.</i>

<i>They're headed
for quite an adventure.</i>

<i>Father God, we ask that you
take the willing hearts</i>

<i>of your children,
Luke and AlÃ© Taylor,</i>

<i>and use them for
your purposes in India.</i>

<i>May they be a blessing
to all around them.</i>

<i>May your light shine
through their lives.</i>

<i>May people
in bondage and dismay</i>

<i>find hope and life in you
because of their work.</i>

Protect them.

<i>Provide for them.</i>

<i>And bring them back to us
safely in your time.</i>

<i>Amen. Amen.</i>

Luke, please, come.

Our hearts are full.

Thank you guys so much.

Man, we're gonna miss you.

<i>But we're confident
that God is gonna do</i>

<i>as much in your
life here at home</i>

as he will through ours.

Ry, you're gonna use
that big mouth for good.

<i>It's gonna echo around the world
and change lives.</i>

And Catherine, you're gonna be
a leader in your workplace,

<i>where many are gonna
follow your example.</i>

And Ethan, there are
great things ahead for you,

<i>and if not graduate school
then something else</i>

bigger and better.

AlÃ©, you wanna come up?

All of you,
just really gonna miss you guys.

<i>But we're just an e-mail
or a very expensive</i>

international
cell phone call away, so.

It's pricey.

You know, we love you.

Thank you.

Alright,
enough of this crying.

Come on.
It's time for some karaoke.

That's where
I say goodnight.

No, I have so much
packing to do.

No, no, no, come on.

Luke, this is our
last time together.

Get up here on this mic.
Right now.

<i>Wel, Luke and AlÃ© are
off on some huge adventure</i>

<i>across the globe,
and here we are cleaning up.</i>

What's wrong
with this picture?

Better find
a mate quick, man.

All the good ones
are dropping like flies.

I'm sorry, did you
just equate dating

with dropping dead
like a fly?

Yes, I did.
Isn't that how you see it?

No, no, I just-

No, I don't have
time for that right now.

I've gotta get back
to the office tonight

to submit some numbers.

Alright, well, guess I'll have
to turn to desperation then.

Story of your life.
-Yeah, what's new?

Status update:

"Anybody got anything
worthwhile going on tonight?"

Wow, that is desperate.

No, no, the saddest pan
is that my mom,

she'll be the
first to respond.

This is true.

Oh! There she is!
Right on cue.

Hello?
Hey Whitney.

Not much.

Yeah, yeah,
I think I can fit that in.

Hey, sounds great.
I'll see you in an hour.

Oooh.

I'm sorry,
what just happened here?

Girl from work
called me.

Is she stalking you
on Facebook?

She's following my Twitter,
thank you very much.

Yeah, she's following
a twit alright.

Hey man,
you don't mind, do you?

Please, you weren't
helping out anyway.

Get out of here.
Go see Whitney.

Hey dude,
I'll see you at the house.

Ah. yes!

Hey, drive safe, okay?

Don't make AlÃ©
worry about you.

Really?

What, she said that
he has one foot in heaven

because of his driving.

Uh-huh.

So, you know anything
about this Whitney girl?

No.

You worried
about them at all?

No, they're just
young and in love

and everything's perfect
for 'em right now

<i>Just wonder what it
would be like if the world</i>

came crashing in
on them, that's all.

Yeah, well, they're gonna get
a big ol' dose of real world

coming here in a few days.

Yeah.

No protecting
my little sister anymore.

I have to go
finish my reports.

I'm sorry.

Please, get out of here.
Thank you.

Hey, find out
about Whitney?

Aye-aye, Captain.

Get out of here.

See you later.

You okay?

Yeah, of course.

It's not lost on me
that everybody's off

on their own adventure
while you-

Get left behind?

I know it's not
what you planned.

Yeah, well.

Maybe Dad was right about
the whole English degree,

you know what I mean?
It is pretty useless.

He's not rig ht.

And those
grad school people...

Well, they don't
know you like I do.

Otherwise you'd be in.

Yeah.

Maybe I was meant to
make sandwiches, you know?

Although, it would've
been nice to know that

before racking up
5 years of student loans.

Ethan, God made you
for this time and place.

He has something really
important for you to do.

No, he has something
important for you to do.

So go do it.

Don't send me any
support letters either, okay?

'Cause that's
all I'm giving you.

No, this-

This is your entire
grad school savings.

I don't need it anymore.

No, you might.

And I-l can't accept
this much money.

Well, you're not
taking all of it.

I kept some of it back
sol can come visit you

in a couple months.

Oh!

Promise?

Okay.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Hey, take care
of Dad for me.

Do I have to?

Hey.
Hey.

Got the bags, got the tickets,
flight's on time.

You ready, Mrs. Taylor?

I'm ready.

<i>Alright, let's do this.</i>

Let's go.
Okay.

<i>- This is</i>-

<i>First you spend
your life dreaming about</i>

<i>how great things
are gonna be one day,</i>

<i>then that one day
finally arrives</i>

<i>and it's thrilling and scary</i>

<i>and it's everything and nothing
like you thought it would be.</i>

<i>And you thank God for the
amazing new things he's doing,</i>

<i>a new adventure, and the way
he put all the pieces in place.</i>

<i>And you pray that you'll
really be able to handle it</i>

<i>like you thought you could.</i>

<i>There's no shortage
of work at Embrace a Village.</i>

Now you're a part of a team
that serves 35 leprosy colonies

by assisting
with medical needs,

making shoes,
serving in pantry,

and working
with the children.

And that's what we're
gonna be doing mostly, right?

There are 300 children
in our after-school program

and 41 living in
our Little Lights Home.

That's a lot of kids.
Yeah.

Yeah, we are in desperate need
of more facility for them,

but we are making do.

Put us to work.

Yeah, first,
we welcome.

Our children want to
greet you in a special way.

I think they are ready.
Just come.

Okay.

Oh, that was great!

Oh, thank you!

Oh, they're so precious.

Rose, do the
children have leprosy?

No, these are the children
with their family members

<i>who have a disease,
but they are healthy.</i>

You want to make
some quick friends?

Of course.

How long did you have to do that
before you gain their trust?

Two years.

And one day I got invitation
from 40 leprosy village leaders.

<i>I shared with them my vision
and my dreams with them</i>

for the medical facility,
education for the villages,

<i>and food for the people,
you know?</i>

I tell them I did not have
funds to do all these things,

but I could feel that they
did not have trust in me.

I'm really worried.

And then Tibrek,
one of the leprosy patients,

asked me if I'd like tea
and I said yes.

<i>And he, with his wounded hand,
washed his cup of tea</i>

and served me
the same cup.

<i>Everybody in the room
was silenced</i>

<i>and wants to see whether
I drink that tea or not,</i>

but I don't have fear about it
because a little act of love

<i>and I really want
to change their life.</i>

<i>I really want to make
difference in their life.</i>

I had the tea

and five leader welcomed me in their village, you know?

You willingly
exposed yourself?

Yeah, see,
for the little act of love

I got five villages' fund.

That's really great.

Professor, how's it going?

Ethan, I'm good.

Just catching up on
some new required reading.

Ah, looks like
a Ryder book.

Oh, we're going to require
all our business majors

to start taking some
Communications courses.

There's so much
integration now.

Anyway, what are you
writing these days?

Oh, I'm not actually.

I'm mostly making
sandwiches, so--

Can you take a minute?

Uh, sure.

How's your sister doing?

Uh, she's good.

Yeah, she doesn't get
much of a chance to e-mail,

but when she does
it sounds great, so-

And you?
What happened to grad school?

I didn't get in.

<i>I got wait-listed
for Boston,</i>

<i>but there's probably like
50 people on that list, so...</i>

semester already started
so that's out.

<i>Luke and AlÃ© are off to India
changing it for good,</i>

<i>Ryder's got a great job
and a new girlfriend,</i>

and Catherine's
already got a company car.

And I've got an apron, so.

And an apron doesn't
compare to a company car.

Well, it does come with
the perk of being reminded

of my failure
everyday by my father.

What failure?

You've got a job.

That can be hard to come by
in this economy.

You've also got time
to figure some things out.

<i>Are you listening
for God's voice,</i>

<i>asking what
he has for you?</i>

Yeah, I mean,
I'm trying to stay close.

<i>You know, I look for signs,
but there are none.</i>

It's just silent.

You know, it's like
everybody else is in the game

and I'm just
sitting on the bench.

I mean, am I not
good enough for God to use?

How do you know
he's not using you?

<i>I get that you feel
like you're on the bench</i>

while your friends
are in the game,

but if that's
where God has you

then you just sit
on the bench in obedience.

<i>I promise, somehow,
what you're doing</i>

<i>will work into what
he has for you in the future.</i>

Makes sense in my head,

just doesn't makes sense
in my heart, you know?

Trust in God's timing.

Until then,
all you can be is-

Obedient.

Thanks professor.

Anytime.

My door, or table,
is wide open to you, Ethan.

Well, I'll be here.

Oh, there's one of my world-changers now.

Probably get to it.

You take care, Ethan.
-You too, professor.

See ya.

Hey you.

You okay?

No. This dream job is
turning into a nightmare.

What?

This whole
Investment West shooting...

It has me feeling like
every decision I make

is life and death.

Where's Ryder?

Uh, he's on his way.

I got a cool video
to show you guys.

Is it gonna make me
feel better or worse?

Uh, worse.

Awesome.

Hey everybody,
meet Whitney.

This is Ethan and Catherine.

I've heard so much
about both of you.

You're so nice,
letting me crash the party.

Nice to meet you.

Um, I'm just
gonna go to the--

Oh yeah, it's
right in the back there.

Okay, cool, thanks.

Hmm?

You know, Ryder, I think
Ethan was joking when he said

that you needed to find
a mate as quick as possible.

Is she the
first one you saw?

She's cute man.
Right?

Hey, you don't mind me
bringing her, do you?

<i>Are you guys,
like, officially dating?</i>

Yeah.

Um, yeah.
I think so.

Has she experienced
your driving yet?

Cate, can't you just
let him be happy for once?

Um, yes.
I totally am.

Rig ht.
You're jealous.

So Ethan, Ryder tells me
that your sister is in India.

It's so amazing.

I really admire
people like that.

Yeah, she's
really great actually.

Um, her only problem is that
she wants to adopt all the kids.

Here, let me show
you guys this video.

Oh, right.
Oh, yay.

<i>Oh, I wanna see.</i>

Yup, okay.

Hi, you guys!

Hi, we miss you terribly.

Oh, Cate, thank you
for the necklaces.

They love them.

You know, Luke's
actually off right now

at one of the villages
with Anil,

and I am, as you can see,
hanging out with the kids.

Say "hi," kids.

Hi, Aunties and Uncles.

So cute.

Hi, Aunties and Uncles.

This is Raj.

He is one of our
miracle children, literally.

They found him tied to a tree
when he was 3 years old

but he is thriving
here and so are we.

It really is starting
to feel like home,

except that you guys
aren't here.

We miss you and we'll see
you at Christmas, okay?

Bye!
Bye!

Bye!

They look happy, huh?
She looks so good.

That's great.

I'm sorry,
are you crying?

It's just-that was
just really beautiful,

I mean, don't you think?

<i>Just the little boy
and the tree.</i>

I mean, we're just
working with computers,

but they're saving
kids' lives.

Yeah, I need to go.

Oh, I thought you
had to tell us about

your good/bad day
at the office.

Nope, uh-oh.
Nope, yuck.

What?
Um, the--

Oh, Holly's here.

Who's Holly?

It's his ex.

Yeah, he broke up
with her.

Come on, lonely guy,
go talk to her.

No, I'm pretty
sure she hates me.

Oh, who would hate you?

Um, she could, yeah.

You should go
talk to her.

Yeah, I mean, somebody
has to take her order.

Yeah Ethan,
go take her order.

Take that order, milkshake,
two straws, two straws.

If this goes horrible,
you guys...

Uh-oh.

But I have to
go back to work.

Hey Holly.

Hey.

Do you wanna--
-Yeah, definitely.

Check this out.

<i>"Oh Holly, how
could I have ever been so blind?</i>

I should have
never let you go."

<i>"I know,
because I'm so beautiful and wonderful</i>

and muy caliente and-
And you just can't handle that."

<i>"Oh,
but I've changed I'm ready.</i>

Won't you drop dead
like a fly with me?"

<i>"Only if
you can handle my clingy eyes."</i>

"Oh, but I can.

I can handle
your clingy eyes."

And your static cling, too.

Oh...

So?

What did she say?

She wants me to call her.

When?

Never.

Yeah, she said that
she thought I was someone

who is going places,

but turns out I'm just a loser
who works in a sandwich shop.

That's not true.

That's not awkward,
is it?

It's a really cute shop.

Thanks.

Okay, I'm gonna go.

Uh, alright.
See you later.

What's with her?

Oh, she just had a bad day
at the office, you know?

Oh, we all have them.

Don't we?
Ain't that the truth?

Hey, can we
get two lattes?

Just, I mean-

I'm sorry,
I'm not your waiter.

Hey.
Hey.

You okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

Yeah.

I'm just-
I'm just tired.

Yeah.

Did you see that
older man that came in?

I mean, he's gonna
lose both of his legs.

The infection's
just so bad.

I wish we could've
caught him earlier,

but you just sit
this one out, okay,

if it's too much?

No, no, no. I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

You know what?

Let's go.

Let's take a break.

Just for
a few days, okay?

We could explore Chennai.

No, honey, come on,
that's so sweet,

but we just-
we have too much to do.

There's no way.

No, I think it'll be good.
It'll be fun.

I'll talk to Anil about it

and we can go see
Marina Beach,

St. Thomas Mount, yeah?

We could go shopping
in the marketplace.

How did I know shopping
was gonna be a pan of this?

Because I'm a girl.

Yes you are.
Yeah.

So?

Okay, okay, yes.

Thank you.

Hey Elizabeth.

Take Your Grand kid
to Work Day?

No, it's Dad's week to
pick me up from school

but he got held up,
so Grandma came and got me.

Oh, and Mr. Rowley has
some big visitor here

so she's so stressed out.

<i>Oh, are
you super bored here?</i>

Mm-hmm.

Would you like a personal
tour around the office?

Sure.

Can I?

Okay, um, what is exciting
here for a 10-year-old?

Uh, okay, well,
there's the Senior Accountant

and Tax Analyst that way,
which is super boring.

We have my
lovely cubicle, huh?

Oh, the big cat,
Mr. Rowley's office right there.

And the infamous board room,
where all the big deals go down.

Sweet.
Hmm? Shall we?

So, this is where all
the important stuff happens.

Big deals that change the world,
hopefully for the better.

Okay, alright, so, there's a
huge deal on the table, okay?

But the board needs
you to convince them.

What are you gonna do?
Go, do it.

Okay, um, my fellow board
members, I implore you--

Ooh, ooh,
big word, nice.

I implore you to
commit to this merger--

Oh, that's Mr. Rowley.

I don't want my grandma
to get in trouble.

Okay, just go, go, go, go.

So tell me, what did you
find out about the Sonji deal?

It would be
extremely lucrative,

<i>but we gotta work our way
around the bank Secrecy Act.</i>

So you do
suspect laundering?

Alright,
is it worth the risk?

In my opinion, absolutely.

<i>Yeah?</i>

Alright then,
let's move forward,

but keep this information
between the two of us, alright?

Who's working on this?

<i>I got a new girl.
She's very green.</i>

She won't catch on.

You sure about that?

I'm sure about that,
come on, let me walk you out.

Don't worry about it.

What were they
talking about?

Um, I don't know.

You know what?

Let's get you back
to your grandma.

Oh, it's Catherine.

Probably some detail
about my party.

You can pick it up;
I don't mind.

I'm good.
You're coming though, right?

I'll be there.
Okay.

So all these posts
from the VPs,

you've been writing those
and they're okay with it?

They asked me to make sure
they have a relevant presence

in social media,
so yeah.

I mean, I've set them
each a Twitter account,

but they hardly use them
which pretty much counteracts

the entire task
that they've given me.

Sol post things now and then
on their behalf.

Here's your file, Ryder.
Thanks Hannah.

What? I mean,
it's nothing bad.

No scandalous photos
or anything.

Have you talked to
Ed Blair about this?

No, who's he?

Ryder.

<i>Ryder, I need you down here</i>

<i>at the Chief Legal Affairs
office right away.</i>

Of course.

That's Ed Blair.

So you overheard them

say they're gonna ignore
BSA regulations?

Well, it's hard to tell
what the exact plan was,

but whatever it is
I think they're trying

to pin everything on me.

I just-I just don't
wanna be a target.

Well, why don't
you tell someone?

You think this is a little
overdoing it, maybe?

This is gorgeous.
And I can't just tell them.

I mean, mat-I'm gonna say
that, like, I was hiding under

the conference table
and I heard a conspiracy?

I mean, he's already
got everybody believing

that I have
something against him

and there's just so much
bureaucracy in this company.

It's like I can't even
go to anybody higher up

without going
through him first.

Hmm.

What do you want me
to do with this?

I don't know.

You know,
I called Ryder the minute--

The minute it happened
and he never called me back.

The minute
it happened, huh?

Yeah, well hejust--
he always knows what to do.

Oh, he always knows
what to do, huh?

Oh, would you stop?
Cut it out.

What do you want me
to do with your napkins?

Not wrinkle them.

That's definitely not
what I want you to do.

They're paper.

You know,
I bet you that he was just

too busy with Whitney
to call me, you know?

What is your problem
with Whitney anyway?

I don't have a
problem with Whitney.

It's, you know-
she just-she's fine.

She just makes
everything different.

Hmm.

I don't know, it just
feels like ever since

Luke and AlÃ© left we've kind of
just all gone our separate ways,

and-I don't know,
it just feels really different.

Maybe for you.

Yeah, well, I think
you have a few good years

left in you yet, so-

Oh, man.

Hey, you're not
supposed to be here.

<i>Hello, we're not done!</i>

We have to cancel the party.

What? What are
you talking about?

<i>I bought your
favorite cake.</i>

Yeah, I seriously made a
massive amount of sandwiches

<i>on my day off.</i>

I got fired.

Awkward.

It looks pretty in here.

Why didn't you
bring Whitney?

1 didn't want her to see me looking sad and pathetic.

But it's okay for us to see
you looking sad and pathetic?

You love me
in my low moments.

You two.

Sad and pathetic, right?

Yup, and perfect
for each other.

So if every body
had been here

I was gonna show you this
video as a surprise.

Just don't ask me
to make it go viral.

What is it?

It's from India.

Oh, yes please.
Hit play.

<i>Happy birthday, Ryder!</i>

<i>Wish we could be
there with you tonight.</i>

Let me be the
first to tell you

that we are excited for what
God has for you this year, Ry.

AlÃ© and I believe in you.

Oh, and we
miss you so much.

All your goofiness,

and every time I think
about you I smile.

What about me?

Oh, you know
I love you.

Okay, we got a special
birthday surprise for you.

If you can just put
the camera over there.

<i>Ready kids?</i>

Happy birthday!

<i>That was great!
We love you, Ry!</i>

<i>We'll see
you at Christmas.</i>

Say "bye," guys.

Bye!

Oh, they look good.
Yeah.

Totally on track
with their dreams.

<i>Remember what Luke
said to me at their send-off?</i>

About my voice being
heard around the world?

Well, that sure got
shut down quick, didn't it?

Hey, I can make your voice
heard around the world.

Hmm? What time is it
in Chennai, do you think?

<i>It's like 10 A.M. tomorrow</i>

Perfect.

Yes!
Yeah?

What, are you
gonna call them now?

Dude, isn't that, like,
crazy expensive?

Well, I'll pay for it.
Happy birthday.

We need to hear
their voices tonight.

Thank you.
Alright.

<i>Come on, come on.</i>

And we're ringing.

Hey, Ethan.

Hey, you must be calling
from Ryder's party.

Hey bud, yeah,
we just watched your video.

You know, these two
could use some cheering up.

Big time.

Hey, put that pretty wife
of yours on the phone.

Oh, I'll try.

She's shopping, I'll try.
But you know howshe gets.

Hey, AlÃ©.

Hey, hold on a second, guys.

Hey, AlÃ©.

<i>Lu--Luke?</i>

What just happened?
Hey, are you there?

Luke, are you there?

Did he find the driver?
Did you find him?

Not yet.
Then keep looking!

I could describe
the truck again.

The officer has
interviewed so many people

and all are agreed
that it was an accident.

AlÃ© come out
in front of the car.

No, it was the
driver's fault.

He was going too fast!

He wasn't even looking
where he was going.

What are you saying?
What is he saying?

Calm down.
He needs to find that driver.

Finding the driver
won't bring her back!

Dad.

What are you doing here?

<i>I thought you
had some big party.</i>

Dad, um...

What?

AlÃ© was hit by a car
in a market in Chennai.

She, um...

<i>She died.</i>

No, she didn't.

God is protecting her.
She's doing important things.

She's gonna be fine.

She's gone, Dad.

What are they gonna
do with my baby girl?

Luke will
bring her home.

<i>Thank you for coming today,</i>

<i>and for showing such love
to Alexandria and her family.</i>

<i>I had the honor
of baptizing her</i>

<i>and watching her grow
here in our church,</i>

leading her in
our campus ministry,

and marrying her and Luke.

<i>AlÃ© as always there
to lend a helping hand.</i>

It was her desire
to serve others.

That continued

and led her and Luke to India
where they would show love

<i>to others who
had been forgotten.</i>

I believe many of you were
touched by her life and I-

I wanted to give an opportunity
to some of you to speak.

Luke, son,
would you like to start?

Thank you.

I met AlÃ© sophomore year

<i>at a campus fellowship meeting
about upcoming outreaches.</i>

When I saw her I--

I couldn't think about
the bar outreach anymore.

I couldn't get over
her presence.

She literally glowed
with such love,

such a love of Christ.

And...

I can't.

One person that couldn't be
here to say a few things,

<i>but sent you
a message by video.</i>

<i>I'm Anil and this is
my wife Rose, from Embrace a Village.</i>

We are so sorry
we can't be there today

<i>to say goodbye to Alexandria.</i>

<i>She had the most giving heart
of anyone that I've ever met.</i>

<i>When she began work
here, that love,</i>

that spirit-filled presence
grew even more.

<i>I wish I had words for what
she meant to the children here.</i>

<i>She was only here
for a short time,</i>

<i>but she won't be forgotten.</i>

Our prayers
are with you all.

I love you, Auntie.

Bob.

Thank you all for coming.

<i>AlÃ©...</i>

AlÃ© was the best daughter her
mom and I could've asked for.

She had such a joy about her

<i>and the biggest smile
on Earth.</i>

She's the one good thing
I have ever done in my life.

<i>I wanna thank you
again for coming.</i>

What is it about funerals

that make people think you
wanna eat tuna casserole?

I mean, I don't even like tuna
casserole when I'm feeling good.

May be we should've
stayed with your dad.

I felt bad
leaving him all alone.

He has plenty of food;
he's fine.

Is this about
what he said?

It's nothing
he hasn't said before.

Well, I thought it
was really beautiful.

I'm sorry, but what
is she doing here?

She doesn't
even know AlÃ©.

Catherine-
I'm sorry, she doesn't.

You don't.

<i>And she's sitting there in tears
like she actually knew her,</i>

but maybe Luke needs
his friends to be here

<i>and not some strangers.</i>

<i>I mean, he ran right
off into his bedroom.</i>

Okay, well, that's
not Whitney's fault.

I don't have to stay.

Whitney.

I was just being supportive.

I can appreciate someone
that my friends loved, can't I?

But I'll stay
out of your way.

Great.

Ahem.
What?

Gone.
You happy now?

I'm sorry, Okay?

<i>Could you two
just stop, please?</i>

I'm just trying to wrap
my mind around this, okay?

I need to understand this.
I just--

1 mean, here 1 am, doing this lame job, right?

Going through the motions.

And then you have
my sister and Luke

trying to do something
worthwhile in the world,

<i>and then this happens.</i>

<i>I mean, how cruel is that?</i>

I mean, what is the
lesson in all this?

Stay shallow,
stay self-absorbed,

<i>stay safe,
and you'll be fine?</i>

<i>But no, try to do something
good in the world</i>

and you'll get cut down?

<i>I mean, what kind
of God does this?</i>

<i>I don't know.</i>

I guess you have to go
by what you know of God.

Yeah, which is a lot
less than I thought I did

<i>a few weeks ago.</i>

Why? Do you think
his character's changed?

You think he doesn't
have any power anymore?

You think we didn't
hear his call right?

If we had stayed here
and done some other work,

and if I hadn't dragged
her across the world--

Hey, you didn't
drag her, okay?

If you weren't in the picture
she would've gone anyway.

But I would've have called
to her from across the street.

<i>Okay, then we wouldn't
have called her on the phone.</i>

<i>Right, right, and
if I hadn't gotten fired</i>

<i>I wouldn't have needed
to call her.</i>

<i>How far back do you
wanna take the blame?</i>

There's always one little thing,
but the fact is God took her.

<i>And I'm not ready to think
that it was for no reason.</i>

<i>I'm not ready to
concede to some victory</i>

<i>to some random act
of violence, either.</i>

I have to find
some meaning in this.

There is no meaning.
There's no meaning in it, Ryder.

If any one of us deserved
to be here, it was her.

I should've been
in that street.

She'd still be here.

You two happy?

<i>This is how grief goes.</i>

<i>First you try to keep everything
as normal as you can;</i>

<i>you pretend it didn't happen,</i>

<i>or you pretend that you
can go on as if it didn't.</i>

<i>Maybe you get angry
at the world, at its injustice,</i>

<i>at anything
or anybody, really.</i>

<i>And then you're just sad.</i>

<i>Your joy is gone,
your smile fades,</i>

you see that
person everywhere,

<i>and nothing looks
the same anymore.</i>

<i>All the things
you believed in are shaken,</i>

<i>your whole foundation.</i>

<i>Things that were certain,
now come into question.</i>

<i>And then one day
you finally tell yourself,</i>

<i>"So that happened
and God let it.</i>

<i>"And if he did, then what does
he want me to do about it?</i>

<i>How am I supposed
to respond?"</i>

I'm out,
you need anything?

No, thanks.

What are you working on?

Resignation letter.

Um, are you sure
you wanna do that?

I don't think that's
what AlÃ© would want.

Well, AlÃ© wanted to go to India
and we see how that turned out.

What's this?

It's a package
from Rose and Anil.

Well, aren't
you gonna open it?

You open it.
I'm done with India.

Okay.

Later.

Here you go, professor.

Thank you, Ethan.

Can I interrupt?

Anytime.

Thanks.

How are you holding up?

Everybody's strong
for Luke, you know?

A few months ago
everything made sense,

everybody was ready
to take on the world,

"This is our time,"
and all that.

Well, it isn't
"your time" really, is it?

It's all God's time.

It's a little hard
to see it that way

when you look at what's
happened, you know?

AlÃ© was a special girl.

It was unfair
what happened.

Yeah.

But it doesn't mean God
isn't still in control.

That just
doesn't make sense.

No, it doesn't.

You look at all
the saints in the Bible,

in their own times things
didn't make sense at all,

even though some
of them were following

the audible voice of God.

Yeah.

Out of all of us, AlÃ©'s
calling was the clearest.

She knew what God wanted
her to do and she was doing it.

But that's the
problem with calling.

Too often we think of it as
something we are meant to do,

when really it's something
we're meant to be.

God may have seemingly random
assignments for us to do

all through our lives,

but they're only
going to make sense

from the person
he's made you to be.

I think AlÃ©
had that right, too.

Her assignments were
shorter than we expected,

but her hean was right
where God wanted it to be.

So then in this moment when
you're asking a lot of questions

that you'll never
have the answers to,

"Who is God asking me to be?"

Thanks Ethan.

You're welcome.

What's this about,
Ethan?

We just need Luke.

Luke?

Is Whitney coming?

No, she broke up
with me.

<i>Sorry.</i>

It's probably
for the best.

This better not be
an intervention.

It's not,
but you need to stay.

<i>Hi.</i>

You told me to open it
and I did.

What is that?

AlÃ© and the children
were working on them.

She made a special
card for each one.

<i>Rose sent them
from India;</i>

she thought we'd still
might like to have them.

Do you know about 'em?

Yeah.

<i>Catherine,
this one's for you.</i>

But it has a "B" on it.

Read the note.

"I had to choose a 'B' for you
because you are so very bold.

"Catherine,
nothing holds you back

"and no one sets
a more Godly example

<i>"in the workplace than you.</i>

I'm so proud of you."

She knew everything.

Ryder, you get a "V."

<i>- "Ry, you may not</i>-

<i>"You're the visionary
of our group, the voice.</i>

"You're gonna
do great things.

<i>I can't wait to see it and
be a part of it in some way."</i>

Whose is that?

My dad's.

It's got a "G" on it
but there's no card,

<i>so I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.</i>

It looks like
somebody knows.

There's no note

'cause she wanted
to surprise him in person.

She wanted to surprise
you all at Christmas.

"G" is for "Grandpa."

She was 8 weeks pregnant.

Why--

Why didn't you tell us?

I couldn't tell myself.

We'd just found out.

So now you tell me

<i>how any of that's
pan of God's plan for us.</i>

<i>So if it's God's call,
it's supposed to be easy?</i>

'Cause that's not what
Paul would tell you, or Stephen,

or Moses, or Jim Elliot
and Nate Saint.

<i>Do you want me
to keep going?</i>

<i>Because it seems to me the most
obedient ones in the Bible,</i>

<i>the ones who were
truly following God's call</i>

<i>on a daily basis,
get thrown in to lions' dens</i>

<i>and fiery furnaces
and shipwrecked and beheaded</i>

and nailed to a cross.

<i>And they're all praised
for being the most faithful</i>

and successful
in God's eyes.

Well, I'm not Jesus.

No, you're not,

but this is the call that
all of us have received,

<i>to be faithful like him,
obedient unto death.</i>

She wasn't saving them
from their sins.

Her death has no purpose.

Yeah? Well, I would argue that
you're wrong, on both counts,

<i>because she
was saving people.</i>

<i>She was pointing them
to Christ.</i>

You know what?

You can't continue
to use your grief

<i>to keep hiding from the work
that you've known is yours</i>

for as long
as I've known you.

That's enough, Ethan.

No, he needs to hear
the whole truth.

And what more
might that be?

That what happened to AlÃ©
could've easily happened here

<i>or anywhere in the States,</i>

and that it has
nothing to do with India

or the work you
were sent there to do

or the person who
called her out on the street

or the person who
called her 'cause he got fired.

Look, Ethan,
you've crossed the line, okay?

Well,
that's what brothers do.

<i>Luke, I know it hurts.</i>

It'll always hurt.

She was my sister.

<i>But you can't Jet the hurt
keep you from going out</i>

and making a difference
in the world.

<i>You gotta go
back there, man,</i>

<i>otherwise you
will never be whole,</i>

<i>you will never be healed,
and you'll never have the life</i>

that you were
meant to have.

<i>It's what she
would've wanted.</i>

You said this
wasn't an intervention.

Somebody
has to go after him.

No, just give him
a few minutes.

You didn't read
your bracelet, Ethan.

It has a "C" on it.

Connector.

"Ethan, your writer side makes
you an observer of people,

"but you do more
than observe;

"you see their hearts,

"and you're the glue
that holds us all together,

"our family, our friends.

"Don't let that job
seem unimportant to you.

Em brace it."

It doesn't look like
Luke sees it that way, huh?

Looks like we're all
falling a little short

of AlÃ©'s expectations.

What are we
gonna do about it?

<i>Well first off!</i>

you two need to realize
that you belong together.

Ethan--

It's true.

And second...

I don't know.

I think I know
who can help us.

Professor Callahan.

Ryder. what's up?

Not much. I wanted to talk
to you if you have a second.

Yeah, how is
everybody since-

Okay, I guess.

You know, it just-
it makes you think.

That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about, though.

Shoot.

Well, I was fired from Mogul,
you may have heard.

These executives were
Meeting such ridiculous things,

just mindless,
pointless garbage,

sol changed some of their
tweets to sound more inspiring,

more purposeful.

I take it that didn't
go over very well.

Yeah, no.

Legal department was not
pleased, to say the least.

They had to approve what
the company appears to endorse

or something like that, which is
crazy because I was so careful.

I mean, I researched each exec,
found out how they were serving

and using their
influences and--

And 1 highlighted their causes,
you know?

I mean, it was amazing.

You should've seen
how many retweets I got.

How many?
-Almost 19,000.

Wow.
Yeah.

I mean, imagine if
those 19,000 retweets

were all tied
to a purpose,

that there was a call to action
for each and every one of them.

I mean, AlÃ© said that I was
a voice to my generation,

and I wanna show her
that it was true.

I'm not supposed to be some
cog in a corporate strategy.

I just--I feel like I have an
opportunity to use this medium

to make a direct difference
for God's kingdom.

Ryder, I do believe
your world just went

from black and white
to color.

How can I help you?

Well, I have an idea,

and Ethan said that you
might be able to help me

take that idea
and turn it into a reality.

He also said that you've
been working on some strategies

for social media
and business.

I need a partner.

<i>Hey Dad.</i>

Hi son.

<i>AlÃ© and the children
made you something.</i>

<i>They made one
for each of us.</i>

It's a-
It's a bracelet.

Seems kind of impractical
for a guy who works with food

<i>and washes his hands
a hundred times a day,</i>

but it's
custom-made for you.

<i>It's got  a "G" on it...</i>

For "Grandpa."

<i>- I like to think it</i>-

For "good."

AlÃ©'s not the
only good thing

<i>you've ever done
in your life, Dad.</i>

You've served people
with joy for decades,

even though you get very
little thanks or recognition.

<i>So to me, that "G" could
stand for "generous, " "giving."</i>

I know I've been a
disappointment to you, Dad,

<i>but I'm not lost.</i>

I'm not unmotivated.

I just don't know why
I'm sidelined rig ht now.

I don't know why
I didn't get into grad school

or get a better job,

but maybe it's
because I was meant to be

right here right now,
with you and everybody else,

because if I had been away
at school when this happened-

I don't know.

Son, you are not
a disappointment to me.

I just want you to turn out
better than your old man.

I don't want you
washing dishes at 50.

You're better than that.

I want you to be more.

But if this is the assignment
that God has for me

then I'm gonna do it.

With singing,
just like you

and that's the most
important pan.

If this is what God has for me,
I'm gonna do it, whatever it is.

Hopefully it includes

giving you that "G" for
"Grandpa" pan one day,

and who knows what else.

I'm just gonna listen
everyday and obey.

Oh, son.

Oh, you're all I've got.

Yeah, sorry about that.

Hey, it's more
than I deserve.

You're a good man, son.

And I love you.

Love you too, Dad.

Good for me.

Alright, okay.

Alright, I wanted to thank
you all for getting involved

<i>and taking a risk
with this new venture</i>

<i>Callahan and I
dreamed up.</i>

I really wanted "Speak Now" to
make a difference in the world,

<i>so I hope you all
catch the vision.</i>

Okay, so here is a list
of all the social media sites

I wanna hit,
but before that,

<i>I just wanted you to
know a little bit more</i>

about AlÃ© and the
Little Lights Children Home

that we're gonna be
raising awareness for.

<i>So if you can all
just take a minute</i>

and check out
EmbraceAVillage.org,

<i>then we'll talk about it.</i>

Hey.
Hi, it's exciting, huh?

Yeah.

Tell me, how are Luke and Ethan
responding to all this?

Ethan gets it, you know,
he's on board.

He's actually even
writing something for me.

What about Luke?

Luke is a little harder
to talk to these days,

but it'll honor AlÃ©,
so he'll be glad.

I think you should have a
conversation with him about it,

before he reads it
on Facebook.

In fact,
why don't you go now?

I can keep things
going here.

No professor, I--
There is so much to do.

I really wanna be here.

I have timeto talk
to Luke, don't worry.

I think you're underestimating
your own influence

and the speed
of the Internet.

I'll talk to Luke, okay?

<i>Luke, good
to see you here.</i>

How you doing, son?

I'm hanging in there.

Look, I wanted to tell you
how pleased we are

with the tribute to AlÃ©.

I'm gonna ask
a couple of our church folk

to donate a matching fund
to the Kickstaner campaign.

I'm sorry, what?

Yeah, the fund
for the children's home.

What a wonderful way
to leave a legacy forAlÃ©.

Pastor, I don't know
what you're talking about.

<i>Hi, okay, I
brought emergency coffees.</i>

Thank you.

Why am I buying
emergency coffee?

Because "Speak Now"
is speaking.

Yup, we have raised over
$50,000 in less than 24 hours.

Oh, my gosh,
you're up and running.

Yep, our first campaign is
for Little Lights Home, look.

Yeah, we launched
AlÃ©'s story,

and the vision
of Embrace a Village

on every form of
social media site that exists.

Yeah, his team has been taking
out the information non-stop.

Wow.
The voice is spreading.

Okay, what can I do?

You could make us
some sandwiches.

Ooh.
Good luck with that.

Hey Luke, dude, come here,
I want you to check this out.

Does it have
anything to do with

you exploiting
my wife's death

to give your
company a name?

No.

That's what I heard
from the pastor.

That's not
what's going on, okay?

You know about this?

Yes, I do.

How could you
do this, Ethan?

Luke, Ethan wrote
a beautiful blog

about AlÃ© and
the children online.

You should read it.

He's building his business
on the back of my dead wife.

<i>He's trying to do something
to help the kids at Little Lights.</i>

I thought you guys
were my best friends.

How could you
be so selfish?

I was just
trying to help.

Come on, you guys are
doing something amazing.

He's just-

AlÃ© would be really proud.

<i>Let me ask you
a hypothetical question.</i>

Say you had
your dream job.

It was everything you wanted,
but you had to turn your head

to certain practices
that you knew were wrong.

What would you do?

What would I do?

A woman alone with a mortgage
and no college diploma?

<i>What would somebody like
you do, hypothetically?</i>

Who is someone like me?

<i>Well, a young beauty
with brains and talent</i>

<i>and integrity...</i>

and faith.

<i>Oh, I think that young woman
already knows what to do, hmm?</i>

It's been a pleasure
working with you.

You too.

<i>You have a moment, sir?</i>

Just
it's time for the meeting.

Did you put everything
together for the Sonji deal?

Yeah, I think you might
want to take a look

at my report
before we go in.

I'm sure it's fine,
Catherine.

We should go,
come on.

Well, I know I'm very green
so I just wanted to make sure

that I was catching on
to what you wanted here.

You think I'm gonna let you
show this to the board?

No sir.

I just wanted to
make sure I had it rig ht.

The company
could profit greatly;

this is a big deal for us.

And you could
also profit.

With all due respect, sir,

that's not how
I want my career to go.

Let me put it
to you this way:

you don't play ball here,
you go home.

Home sounds
pretty good to me.

<i>Greetings to
the weary and famished</i>

<i>Greetings to
the weary and famished</i>

Alright,
it's pepperoni, man.

Have you seen
the numbers?

Remarkable.
$80,000.

You haven't
been online lately.

Why? What?

With the matching fund added in,
you're within a few hours

of having the whole lot,
I'd say.

We have to call
Rose and Anil.

They're not
gonna believe it.

Hey, good to see you guys.
Hey, how's it going?

Thank you
so much for coming.

Hey, we're gonna get started
in just a second, okay?

Go get interviewed.
Yeah, yeah, no.

<i>In front
of the books there?</i>

<i>Just up
on the side, or-</i>

I don't know,
just put it somewhere.

Any word from Luke?

No, I called and texted
like a thousand times,

but no response.

What?
You, texting?

Yes, I know how.

Man, he has to come.

Ethan's gonna
give it one more try.

Okay, good.

Hey, I wanted
to talk to you-

I wanted to talk to
you about something.

I was gonna tell you about
it yesterday but I kind of,

you know, lost track of-

Okay, well,
let me just say

I wanted to wait 'til
we gotn the day behind us

but I think we
should date, formally.

You do?

Don't you?

Well, yes, sure.

I just--that's not what I
was gonna say, is the thing.

It's not?
No.

I was gonna tell you
that I quit my job.

You did?
Uh, yeah.

Well, good for you.

Really?
Yeah.

You absolutely made the
right choice, from what I hear.

Okay, okay then.

Okay, um-

Actually, I'd like to talk
about that dating thing

that you mentioned.

Look, our
guests are here.

Is tomorrow night
too soon to start?

Nope.

Hi.

<i>Hey, Professor Callahan.</i>

Joe, Pat, welcome.

You must be Jack.
I'm Ryder.

Nice to meet you,
Ryder.

You know, I've talked to you
guys so many times on the phone,

I feel like I know you.

Hi, I'm Catherine McGary.
Hi Catherine, Jack.

Hi, it's so nice
to meet you.

And thank you so much again
for flying in for this.

No, thank you Ryder.

What you've done
is incredible.

Uh, so where's Luke?

Um, he's-
He's not here.

We're actually
not sure if he's coming.

<i>It's all been
really hard on him.</i>

No, he'll be here,
I just know it.

I'm headed to the thing.

I'm sure everybody's
gonna be asking aboutyou,

<i>what you're up to,
how you doing.</i>

<i>What do you
want me to tell them?</i>

Whatever you wrant.

Look, I wanted
to apologize

for jumping on your case
the other day.

<i>I'm not sorry
for what I said,</i>

<i>but! 'm sorry
for the way I said it.</i>

Everyone's emotional.

Yeah.

You know, I've been thinking
a lot about AlÃ© today.

About how happy she'd be to
see the kids get a new facility.

<i>I bet she'd be right there,
digging the ground up</i>

<i>just to get it started,
don't you?</i>

Probably so.

I was also thinking how
happy she'd be to see you

tell them
about it yourself.

<i>I had the airline change
the ticket to your name.</i>

The date's open-ended so you can
go back whenever you're ready.

And when you get a chance,
read the blog.

Should we go ahead?

We just don't know if they're
coming, sol say yes, let's go.

Okay.

Is this on?
Is this on?

Hey, hey everyone.

<i>Can I have you all
come in for a second?</i>

<i>I just wanted to say thank you
for coming here tonight.</i>

And a special thanks
to Joe and Pat Clendenny

<i>and Jack Kennedy
from Embrace a Village</i>

<i>for being here.</i>

We're here tonight
to pay a special tribute

to Alexandria Taylor

and the legacy
that she left behind.

"Speak Now" wanted
to honor her efforts

<i>by continuing
the work there.</i>

<i>Thanks to all of you
putting forth your time,</i>

efforts, and money
into this campaign,

we were able to raise
the full cost of an addition

to the Little Lights
Children's Home.

Joe, Pat, and Jack,
please come forward.

We are just pleased

to present you with
a check for $100,000.

Now's your time
for the photo ops, press.

Joe, please say
a word or two.

Thank you all
so much, thank you.

You know,
the harvest is plentiful,

but the workers are few.

We were so blessed to
have had AlÃ© and Luke Taylor

as a part of our team.

<i>They were faithful workers</i>

<i>in a place they were
so desperately needed.</i>

Now Luke, don't hide now,
come on up front.

My friend, I know this is not
the way you saw your life going,

and I know
you're still in pain,

but the door's
always open to you, Luke,

if you're ever ready to
carry on with what you began.

You will always
be in our hearts

and a pan
of Embrace a Village.

And Luke, always
a pan of our family.

Would you like
to say a few words?

Uh, I want to thank my friends
for doing this in AlÃ©'s memory.

It really is an
amazing accomplishment.

A wise person recently
told me that God's calling

<i>isn't to do something,
but to be something,</i>

<i>you know,
to be obedient</i>

<i>and find the fulfillment
in God's desires</i>

in our character
and not our works.

Sol don't know that doing
something for God in India

<i>is really my calling.</i>

But I do know that I was the
best person I've ever been.

<i>More alive, more fulfilled,</i>

<i>and passionate
to hear God's voice</i>

and obey him
when I was in Chennai

with these kids
and this ministry.

So are you going back?

I've already got my ticket,
so I guess so.

Tell Raj that
I'll see him soon.

Thank you so much.

See you in Chennai.
-You will.

"W.C."

The world changer's
back, man.

<i>One minute
it's bright and hopeful,</i>

<i>and the next, something
seemingly inexplicable happens,</i>

but God is there.

Thank you.

What's that?

Boston U.

Someone couldn't
continue with the program,

so they had
a spot open up.

I'm first
on the waiting list.

I'll be a semester behind,

but hey man,
I'm used to that, right?

Congrats, man!

It's a good thing
I still have this.

Oh, no, no, no.

I wrote this for both of you.
It's still yours.

I'm good, and
you need it now, so.

Yes !

Ooh, that doesn't seem
like such a good idea to me.

Oh, but this one does.

Well, congratulate me, boys.

I am the proud owner
of a used Honda.

Hey!

Awesome, did you take
the job at the non-profit?

No, no, no.

I'm staying in the corporate
world; that's my battlefield.

Took a job with the
investment firm down the street.

Nice.
Yeah.

<i>One day you
think you have it all figured out</i>

<i>and then you realize
that there was something</i>

even better
because God is there.

This is it.

I'm proud of you, son.

Go show 'em
what you got.

Will do.
-Yeah.

<i>One day follows
the next, good times and bad times.</i>

<i>Times where your
dreams are on-hold</i>

and times where
they come true.

<i>Times where
you feel alone</i>

<i>and times where you
feel love overwhelming.</i>

<i>Times where
you make sacrifices</i>

<i>and times where you are
overwhelmed by blessings</i>

<i>because you're obedient
and God is there.</i>

<i>He takes all these times
and he works in you,</i>

<i>he works through you.</i>

<i>Give it all to him.</i>

<i>This is his time.</i>

Hi, I'm Joe Clendenny,
founder of Embrace a Village.

I hope you enjoyed the film,
but more than that,

I hope you will walk away
with an understanding

of how each life can
make a huge difference

and can impact
many others.

Though the characters
of Luke and AlÃ©

are fictitious
in the movie,

the stories
of Embrace a Village

and the Little Lights
children's program

are very true.

<i>Embrace a Village is a vibrant,
humanitarian organization</i>

<i>in India today.</i>

<i>We exist to help transform
the lives of leprosy victims</i>

<i>and their families, many
of whom you saw in this film.</i>

<i>Our mission continues to be
bringing Jesus Christ's</i>

<i>message of hope and healing
to these forgotten people;</i>

people like little Raj, who came
to us at 3 years old, unnamed.

<i>Today Raj is thriving.</i>

<i>He's being educated,
learning two languages,</i>

<i>studying God's Word daily,</i>

<i>and has positive dreams for
a bright and prosperous future,</i>

but he is just
one story of so many.

I invite you to watch
the special 3-minute video

of Embrace a Village
on this DVD

and to join us
in this heartfelt calling

to reach
these hurting people.

The harvest is plentiful,
but the workers are few.

Won't you support us?
