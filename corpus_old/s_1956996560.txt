("Overture" by Jerry Herman)

(pedestrians chattering)

(elves chattering)

[Elf] I love exercise.

â™« Teddy's vest has satin lining

â™« And the locomotive's brass is shining

â™« And the sparkle and the gloss

â™« We attribute to the boss

â™« Miss Muffet's hair is twice as curly

â™« And, we're wrapped and
packed and finished early

â™« So, a big round of applause

â™« To our sturdy and smart

â™« Top on the job

â™« Soft in the heart

â™« Positive, practical

â™« Mrs. Claus

â™« We still have seven days till Christmas

Oh team, we've done it.

1910 is a record year.

You are a magician Arvo.

No, you're the magician, Mrs. Claus.

Well, what counts is
we've done it all together.

I mean, look at these
wonderful teddy bears.

They stand up to a lot of loving

and that is the most important test.

[Elf] Oh yes it is.

And, now you can all
go home a week early.

(elves gasping)

And, have the very merriest Christmas.

Oh, aren't you tickled, Arvo?

I mean, with all of the toys made,

the only thing left is the delivery.

Of course, Santa will take care of that

and you'll be able to
spend a real Christmas Eve

at home with your family.

What about you, Mrs. Claus?

Another Christmas Eve alone?

After the first hundred years
or so, you get used to it.

[Santa] More mail?

Nicholas--

[Elf] That's not all.

More mail.

Well, don't worry, darling,
there are plenty of toys

for these children and much more.

Here's your cocoa, dear.

Nicholas, if you have a moment,

there's something that I'd
like you to take a look at.

Is it me, or are there more children

in the world every year?

Well, as it happens, there are,

which is why I was looking
over your navigational maps.

Yes, yes, sounds very interesting.

You see, if you change
course here and head off

in an easterly direction--

Oh, Easter is lovely.

Course it's no Christmas, but--

Nick, (chuckles) you haven't
heard a word I've said.

Yes, I have.

You wanna serve a new course for Easter.

Bread pudding's always
nice, don't you think?

(Mrs. Claus sighs)

Oh, Nick, I wish you'd let me help you

with the mail this year.

They write to Santa Claus.

They're gonna have their
letters read by Santa Claus.

Now, call me old fashioned,
but I only know one way

to do this job and that's to do it right.

We're getting behind, chief.

I've never seen this much mail.

But, I haven't made a
dent in the last batch.

(letters clattering)

Wait!

Do you suppose there's a letter in there

addressed to both of us?

Oh, didn't think so.

Well, at least drink some of your cocoa

while it's still warm.

Oh, it's very chilly in here.

I think someone must've
left a window open.

Oh look!
(dramatic music)

You can see it tonight.

Oh, the North Star.

Nearly as bright as on Christmas Eve.

When it guides you safely home to me.

Don't want to catch a chill, do we.

(Santa chuckles)

Well, if you don't need me for anything...

And, there's always the naughty ones

with the bad handwriting.

Hmm, did you say something, Anna?

Oh, no, no, nothing at all.

â™« I need something challenging to do

â™« Somewhere marvelous to go

â™« He's seen every little
corner of the world

â™« All I've ever seen is snow

â™« I'm Mrs. Santa Claus

â™« The invisible wife

â™« And Mrs. Santa Claus needs a change

â™« In her life

â™« I've been manning the business

â™« And planning each holiday plan

â™« And I'm tired of being the
shadow behind the great man

â™« For each December when
Santa's checking his list

â™« 'Tis the season that he forgets I exist

â™« So the moment has
come to beat my own drum

â™« Because

â™« I want the world to know
there's a Mrs. Santa Claus

Arvo, hitch up the reindeer, please.

The reindeer?

Where are you going?

I'm going to try out this map.

I just know that this new
route will save gobs of time.

Yeah, but what about
the chief (mumbles)?

When are you coming back?

Well, I'll be back before morning, dear.

Just tell him that I've
gone out for a little spin

around the world.

[Arvo] Please guys, look after her.

â™« I'm Mrs. Santa Claus

â™« Yes, I'm married to him

â™« And for centuries I've
been proper and prim

â™« But I'm tired of folding the bedding

â™« And spreading the jam

[Arvo] Oh boy!

â™« And I feel I'm about to
begin to find out who I am

â™« I've planned my strategy
and my flag is unfurled

â™« For I have gifts of my
own to offer the world

â™« So I'm coming your way

â™« Keep an eye on my sleigh

â™« Because

â™« I want the world to know
there's a Mrs. Santa Claus

â™« So I'm coming your way

â™« Keep an eye on my sleigh

â™« Because

â™« You'll have a Merry Christmas with

â™« Mrs.

â™« Santa

â™« Claus

(reindeer moaning)

Just a little heavy weather.

Steady boys.

(thunder cracking)

We'd better get down on the
ground until this passes.

Gently now.

Oh dear, I thought we were
supposed to be near Stockholm.

Uh, get ready for an
emergency landing, boys.

Easy.

Whoa, whoa boys.

Whoa.

(sleigh screeching)

Well, my goodness.

Are you all right, sweethearts?

(reindeer grumbling)

It was a bit unexpected, wasn't it?

(bells chiming)

It's all right, everything
is going to be fine.

That's a good boy, Prancer.

You're a very good boy.

(reindeer moaning)

What is it, darling?

Oh, Cupid.

Well, we're all safe and sound, aren't we?

Oh, you've hurt your poor leg.

(men chattering)

(Marcello vocalizing)

Lovely singing.

(speaking foreign language)

Good morning.

I wonder if you could help me, dear.

You see, I had a little mishap with my--

Horse?

Not exactly.

Come along, Cupid dear.

(Cupid moaning)

Yes.

[Marcello] It's a reindeer.

Yes, a reindeer.

Oh for a Christmas pageant.

Yes, a Christmas pageant (chuckles).

Quite a big one.

We do it every year.

Oh.

Is he very badly hurt?

Hey.

It's not broken, senora,
but he will need a rest.

You leave him here with me?

Oh, I'd be so grateful.

How soon will he be able to fly?

Uh, that is, how long will
it be before the poor darling

is all healed?

One week he will be as good as new.

Oh goodness, one week?

But, I absolutely have to
be home by Christmas Eve

at the very latest.

[Marcello] Nothing to worry, senora.

I give him extra special care.

Oh, thank you very much.

I am Marcello Damaroco.

I'm honored Marcello.

Where you come from Mrs. uh--

I come from the North,
uh, from the North.

Ah, Senora de North.

Well, actually, yes, I'm Mrs. North.

Marcello, I don't suppose you have room

for a few more?

More?

Well, it would be a very
sorry Christmas pageant

with only one reindeer.

Come along, dears.

This is the one we call Blitzen.

(reindeer groaning)

Comet.

And, Prancer and Vixen, of course.

No more, please, senora.

Oh, just Dasher and Donder and Dancer.

I realize that eight is a lot.

But, they won't be any bother.

I mean, they could double up.

Well we better get
them some breakfast, no?

Where are you staying, Mrs. North?

Oh, I hadn't given it a thought.

Any old place to unbutton
my boots will do you know.

Come, I take you to
the best boarding house

in all of New York City.

Right down here on Avenue A.

Women of the world unite!

A revolution is at hand.

Join us in the march to Union Square.

The time for change is now.

There she is, mouthing off again.

This is my Sadie.

She's beautiful, no?

[Mrs. Claus] Oh, she's beautiful, yes.

Is she a friend of yours?

Ah, no, no, no.

She speeches to me, but
I never speak to her.

Her mama is the lady I tell
you about who rents the rooms.

And, we need it now!

Brava, beautiful.

What she needs is a man.

Sawbuck Sadie, give it a rest.

Senora Shaughnessy, Senora Brandenheim.

It's time to throw down
the shackles of oppression

once and for all and march as--

Hey, enough.

Quiet Mama, I'm not finished.

Not finished?

The police look, down
the street is coming.

Quick before he sees you.

No Mama, this is a free country.

For free they'll throw us out of it.

Come.

â™« Welcome to the world of Avenue A

â™« Where there's a family drama

(pedestrians chattering)

This is the lady I
was telling you about.

Senora Lowenstein, she's right down here.

She has beautiful rooms, reasonable rates.

It think it'll be suitable for a few days.

Senora Lowenstein.

(speaking foreign language)

I bring to you a new boarder.

May I present, Mrs. North.

I'm delighted to meet you.

A pleasure, Mrs. North.

Sadie!

Ah, Mr. Kilkenny, one
of my finest boarders.

Good morning, ma'am.

If you don't mind, I have
to go catch the trolley.

Now, goodbye, Nora.

And, make sure no trouble today.

I'll be good, Da.

All right.

Sadie, help our new guest to the house.

Enough with the women's suffering.

Women's suffrage, Mama.

One man, one vote.

The law says nothing about women.

(chuckles) Excuse my daughter.

She's a little excitable.

Oh, but she does have a point.

Why thank you.

I'd like you to meet your
greatest admirer, Sadie.

This is Marcello Damoroco.

An honor, signorina.

I come to listen to you every day.

To my speeches?

To you is speech,
signorina, to me is a song.

If I could, I would give my vote to you.

(child shouting)

[Officer] Come back here.

[Nora] Oh, I didn't
do nothing, you dirty--

Don't you lie to me.

You raising the devil out here.

Get inside.

I'll go, I'll go.

Just let go of me.

(kick thudding)

(officer shouting)

Hooligan!

You wait and see, but I'll be speaking

to your father.

Come, you shouldn't freeze out here.

Oh, where I come from, this
is picnic weather (laughs).

Oh, I'm afraid I can't take

one of your rooms, Mrs. Lowenstein.

You see, I have no money.

A fine lady like you?

You'll get a job.

You'll pay me when you can.

Come.

Thank you, Marcello.

â™« I've landed in the world

â™« Of Avenue A

â™« Where you hear como esta

â™« And bless my soul and oy vey

â™« So, a lady from a cold and distant place

â™« A lifetime away

â™« Still can become part of the world

â™« Of Avenue A

(lively music)
(pedestrians chattering)

And, this is the parlor.

(Mrs. Claus chuckles)

I take in a little sewing
on the side, as you can see.

You want something mended, you just ask.

Well, I'm afraid I only
have the clothes on my back.

(gasps) Oh!

Well, I know a ladies emporium.

Gorgeous second-hand
clothes, on credit yet.

(women giggling)

Well don't tell me that you made this!

For my fancy customer, from uptown.

Let me.

Oh thank you.

Dinner, I serve at 6:00.

Extra five cents a day should you want.

Oh thank you, I want.

(light knocking)

Excuse me.

Where's that little
hellion, Nora Kilkenny?

Is her father at home?

No, no, not here.

On the trolley car he's working.

Day and night.

Well, you tell him for
me that his little hooligan

has been raising holy hellfire.

Excuse the language, missus and missus.

I'll tell him sir,
officer, Your Honor, sir.

Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein, you're shaking.

I think he's coming to take away Sadie.

She makes such trouble.

Oh, just for speaking on the sidewalk?

I have seen what comes
from this in the old country.

(somber violin music)

This bag in the closet, this

I always keep packed and ready.

A candlestick from my grandmother,

pictures of my husband,
may he rest in peace.

He didn't live to see America.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

And, at the rate my Sadie is going,

they could throw out tomorrow.

So, always the bag stays packed.

Women of the world, unite!

A revolution is at hand.

And, when we take our rightful place...

Well, some day.

You'll see.

Everyone will see.

Here, beautiful miss.

Please, let me help you down.

It may surprise you to know that a woman

is perfectly capable of taking a step

without a man's help.

But, thank you.

My pleasure, signorina.

â™« In the middle the slush, the noise

â™« The teeming grind of the day

â™« Look how a lovely rose can bloom

â™« On Avenue A

Now, tonight latkas
I'm making for Hanukkah.

Oh yes, Hanukkah.

Hanukkah.

While you're having Christmas.

So, we're having Hanukkah.

So, what happened to all my eggs?

Ush!

Now, I have to go out and get.

So, you don't celebrate Christmas.

No.

But, between you and me, I'm
enjoying it more than I should.

(women giggling)

(Nora coughing)

Officer Doyle.

Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein.

Well, hello.

Hello.

Well, you darling girl.

You found the eggs that Mrs. Lowenstein

was looking for.

I seen you, you little brat.

By God, I have you now.

Oh cripes, Doyle!

In here.

(loud knocking)

Uh, where is she?

The girl?

Oh, did I hear little
footsteps going out the back way?

Thanks very much, missus.

(light knocking)

[Mrs. Claus] All clear.

Hey, why did you do that?

It so happens that I
like children very much.

You living here?

For awhile.

Me too.

I'm Nora.

Oh, I'm Mrs. North.

Mmm, and where is your mother?

She's back in Ireland.

My old man's working double shifts

to pay for a steamship ticket to bring her

and my baby brother over.

So, your mother is in
Ireland and your father

is working all the time.

Hey, I pull my own weight.

I got me a job over at Tavish's.

You have a job?

Well, why shouldn't I?

Don't you?

At the moment, no.

Uh, but I do need one.

All right, you did for me
so I'll do for you, kiddo.

Kiddo?

That's New York talk.

Oh.

I don't suppose you'd know
anything about making toys?

Oh.

(comical music)

â™« The red balloons may stain your ceiling

â™« And the fire engine's paint is peeling

â™« Put my heart

â™« Just squeals with joy

â™« I've just made a Tavish Toy

â™« It only has to last till Christmas

â™« A few tight smiles I'm always cautious

â™« 'Cause those dimpled
faces make me nauseous

â™« So to each

â™« Sweet girl and boy

â™« You deserve a Tavis Toy

â™« So when you're low

â™« And when you're down

â™« Remember kids

â™« Because of you

â™« I live uptown

â™« A house in Chelsea

â™« So the teddy bear
has popped its stitches

â™« And the cowboy doll
has lost its britches

â™« But to all

â™« In my employ

â™« Be proud you made a Tavis Toy

Sing kids!

â™« We're proud we made a Tavish Toy

And?

â™« A one of a kind

â™« Tip of the line

â™« Fully insured

â™« Rather unusual

â™« Tavis Toy

â™« It only has to last till Christmas

Ah, here she is now.

Workers.

(cane tapping)

Allow me to present Mrs. North,

your new supervisor.

Welcome, welcome to the
wonderful world of Tavish Toys.

We're so lucky to have found someone

with Mrs. North's experience
and on such short notice.

Uh, yes.

Well, it certainly
looks as if I'll have to

roll up my sleeves a bit.

(chuckles) Well, I shall
leave you to your own devices.

Just keep in mind, time is
of the essence, tick, tock.

Well, I'm certainly used
to the Christmas rush.

[Tavish] Outstanding.

Now, my little elves,
I do not want a repeat

of what happened to the
last supervisor, hmm?


Well, hello.

You're awfully small to
be using such a big broom.

That's Emilio.

He don't talk.

He's new in America.

I know just how he feels.

Now, if I might ask, what
happened to the other supervisor?

I was told that he was taken ill.

Yeah, he tripped over something.

Yeah, your foot.

(children laughing)

Hey, Mrs. North is all right.

She's my friend.

If she's your friend, tell
her to get us some heat.

Yes, it is a bit
frosty in here, isn't it?

There must be some kind of
malfunction with the stove.

[Child] Yeah, it don't function

till Tavish puts some coal in it.

Well, I'll have to speak to Mr. Tavish

about that, won't I?

I've always felt that a happy workshop

is a productive workshop.

Don't you agree?

Have you ever worked in
a factory before, lady?

[Girl] Tell her, Fritzie, tell her.

Well, it so happens that we're

in the toy business ourselves back home.

Get her.

What's an old lady know about toys?

(children laughing)

Old lady?

Certainly, you're not referring to me.

â™« I'm holding back the hands of time

â™« And though a fool might say

â™« I passed my prime

â™« My heart has always clung

â™« To staying almost young

â™« A few gray hairs, a few gold teeth

â™« Can never hide the kid that's underneath

â™« A kid whose hopes are hung

â™« On staying almost young

â™« My walk is swift and sporty

â™« My disposition is evergreen

â™« Why say I'm over 40

â™« I'm over 17

â™« I'll still have all the speed it takes

â™« When all the others
have applied the brakes

â™« And when my knell has rung

â™« I'll still be struttin' and kickin'

â™« Like some little chicken

â™« I'm almost young

I hope you're almost finished.

Not a chance, kiddo.

â™« So if you think this spunky pup

â™« Is either boggin' down or slowin' up

â™« You'd better hold your tongue

â™« I'm feeling almost young

(children laughing)

See, I told ya.

â™« My bones are often racked up

â™« They always act up

â™« Each time it rains

â™« But my arthritis and my phlebitis

â™« Are simply growing pains

â™« So let them say I passed my peak

â™« That I'm a million
years from hide-and-seek

â™« But when my dirge is sung

â™« I'll still be tough as a
riddle and fit as a fiddle

â™« And struttin' and kickin'
like some little chicken

â™« And almost

[Boy] Come on, Mrs. North.

â™« Young

(children cheering)

(children giggling)

Happy workers, that's what I like.

Grateful, happy workers.

Yes, but, there are
some problems, Mr. Tavish.

I mean, the heat, for instance.

Heat?

I don't feel any heat, do you?

Oh, and there's a matter of quality.

Mr. Tavish, have you ever seen how a child

plays with a teddy bear?

What's your point, Mrs. North?

Well, give this bear a hug
and you'll see what I mean.

Um, no.

Oh just a little hug.

Get that bear away from me.

Well then, I'll show you myself.

This is how a child hugs
a teddy bear, Mr. Tavish.

There, you see what I mean?

I mean, what's needed
here is thicker cloth

for the fur.

And, good, strong thread.

You worry too much, Mrs. North.

You look at the bear and see the flaws.

I look at it and see
the happiness it brings.

Oh, but I don't think that defective toy

makes any child happy, Mr. Tavish.

I was referring to the
happiness it brings to me.

The more we make, the more
we sell, the happier I am.

Tick, tock, Mrs. North, tick, tock.

Mr. Tavish, if you've
ever see a child's face

when a toy breaks.

Workers, what's our motto?

[Children] It only has
to last till Christmas.

Oh, but Mr. Tavish.

The children's hands are
shaking with the cold.

Can't anything be done?

Of course something
can be done, Mrs. North.

Mittens.

But, Mr. Tavish, Mr. Tavish, sir.

Auggie Tavish.

Children, the conditions
in here are intolerable.

So, what are you gonna do about it?

Well, I haven't decided just yet,

but when I do, I do know

that we all have to stick together.

What do you say?

(children cheering)

â™« So let them say you passed my peak

â™« That you're a million
years from hide-and-seek

â™« But when my dirge is sung

â™« You'll still be tough as
a riddle and fit as a fiddle

â™« And struttin' and kickin'
like some little chicken

â™« And almost young

(children cheering)

(delicate music)

Here we go.

Piping hot.

Thank you, Arvo.

Rrruck!

My wife made this cocoa?

Uh (chuckles) looks like
nice is beating naughty

'bout 100 to one this year.

Arvo, I asked you a question.

Who made the cocoa?

I made the cocoa.

I'm a supervisor.

I'm not a cocoa elf.

Why didn't Mrs. Claus make it?

Arvo, I repeat, why
didn't Mrs. Claus make it?

Uh, Mrs. Claus isn't here, chief.

Isn't here?

That's impossible.

Where would she be?

Uh, well, she said to uh, tell you, that

she's taking a little trip.

Around the world.

Arvo, why didn't she tell me?

I would've stopped her.

Maybe that's what she didn't tell you.

Well, why didn't you tell me, Arvo?

I've been expecting
her back any minute now

and I didn't want you to worry.

Besides, you didn't even
notice she was gone.

Well I wa...

Well certainly I...

Well she hasn't been gone--

Two days.

That's not possible.

Surely I would've...

Look, if you had taken
notice of her now and then,

maybe she wouldn't have left.

Where on Earth can she be?

In a few days it'll be Christmas.

Well, if she's not back soon,

we may not even have Christmas.

She took the reindeer.

Can't bear to think of
her out there, somewhere,

helpless and alone.

[Santa] Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas.

Thank you, young man.

A very worthy cause, dear.

But, the boots aren't quite right.

(lively music)

(trolley bell ringing)

Good morning, Mr. Kilkenny.

It is time for change.

We have the right to demand the vote.

Look at Susan B. Anthony.

Look how one woman has taken up--

(speaking foreign language)

Oh, nice and crunchy (giggles).

Just like the boys like them.

I wonder, would you be a dear
and send over eight bunches

of these to the Delancey stables?

And, some of these lovely apples, too.

I think 20 pounds should do it.

And, tell Marcello that
Mrs. North sent them.

He'll know what to do.

[Man] Marcello, Delancey Stables.

Mrs. North.

(speaking foreign language)

The workers were not afraid
to speak up for their rights.

And, when the bosses wouldn't
give him a better wage,

the workers demanded it.

And, the right to vote will not be granted

until women demand it.

I demand some hot water.

Why don't you holler
on my landlord, Sadie?

Who will march with me to Union Square?

It's hopeless.

All these women care about is
the price of pushcart onions.

I know.

You know, Sadie, I'm in
a bit of a predicament

and I think you might be just the person

to help me.

[Sadie] Really?

Now, try to imagine a group of workers

in a factory, let's say.

Now, how might they improve
their working conditions?

Keeping in mind that the boss
is a rather difficult man.

Not inclined to give in to
demands, if you know what I mean.

And, that's all you have to do.

It's really that simple?

Oh, it's been successful in factories

all over the country.

I wish the other women
around here would listen

to me the way you do.

I promised I'd...

You're a good influence, Mrs. North,

keeping my Sadie out of trouble.


I promised that I'd
bring a whole contingent

from Avenue A to the rally tomorrow.

Instead, I'm just bringing a soapbox.

Well, if you wouldn't
mind a little advice

from a Johnny-come-lately like me?

No, please.

I so admire your fervor, Sadie.

But, I don't believe anyone
likes to be shouted at.

Well, I shout so my
message can be heard.

Perhaps if you try
talking to these ladies

without your soapbox.

Good afternoon, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

Well, if it isn't Soapbox Sadie.

I'll have none of your blarney now.

Good day to you, Mrs. North.

And, to you, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

You know, Sadie was just telling me

how you came all the way
over here from Ireland

when you were just a girl.

My own mother brought
10 of us over from Dublin.

Oh, did you say Dublin,
on the River Liffey.

Bless my soul.

You know Dublin, Mrs. North?

Well, I'm very keen on geography.

Now, Mrs. Shaughnessy,
there must've been some

who told your mother to stay put.

Oh well, there were many that tried.

But, you don't know my mother.

But, are you very many
of the women like her?

You for example.

That's why we're asking you

to stand strong, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

Just like your mother.

And, march with us.

[Mrs. Claus And Sadie]
For a woman's right to vote.

(stick thudding)

Mr. Brandenheim makes all the decisions.

What do I need the vote for?

But, Mrs. Brandenheim, you yourself

make 100 decisions every day.

Don't you decide what you make for dinner?

Yah, I do that.

And, don't you decide
how much coal to buy?

Yah, I do that.

And, how many nickels
to put in the cookie jar?

Yah, I do that too.

So, shouldn't you
decide who gets elected?

Yah!

Oh, all this deciding.

It wears me out.

[Sadie] Oh well, I guess it's only

the two of us after all.

Still I'm proud to
march with you, Sadie.

â™« I'm Mrs. Shaughnessy
and I'm marching with you

â™« I'm Mrs. Brandenheim
and I'm joining you too.

â™« It's time to stand up,
step out, and be counted

â™« And then

â™« How about tying an
apron on all of the men

Vote for women!

â™« Now, Mr. Brandenheim
thinks how clever he is

â™« But, this old girl has a
brain that's equal to his

â™« So, remember our call

â™« A line that you all can quote

â™« It's time for every miss
and missus to have a vote

But, beyond the vote.

I mean, men must acknowledge what we do

in little ways every day.

Mrs. North, wait for me.

Oh yes, come along, Nora.

Isn't it marvelous what happens

when people speak up for themselves.

And, you know what, Nora?

[Nora] What?

That's what's going to
happen at Tavish Toys.

Now Sadie was telling me
about something called

a work slowdown.

I think it just might do the trick.

[Nora] We'll get heat?

Only if we stick together, Sadie set.

I'm with you, Mrs. North.

Oh Marcello, thank goodness.

I'm on pins and needles
about getting home.

Tell me, how is Cupid?

What are you doing here, Marcello?

I want for you having a vote, signorina

and all that your heart desires.

[Santa] Ho, ho, ho.

Merry Christmas.

Ho, ho, ho.

We mustn't catch cold, must we dear.

Thank you.

Wait for me.

I'm coming.

(women shouting)

â™« We planned our strategy
and our flag is unfurled

â™« For we have gifts of
our own to offer the world

â™« So, remember our call

â™« A line you all can quote

â™« It's time for every miss and missus

â™« To have a vote

(gentle music)

How are we doing, sweetheart?

(reindeer grunting)

Oh, I know, I know.

Oh, I imagine that Santa
is terribly worried

about us by now.

And, that's why you've got to
stay off that leg, darling.

Give it a chance to heal.

There's a sweetheart.

(reindeer grunting)

I know, I know, Christmas
Eve is fast approaching.

Only three days until.

There she is.

Brava, Sadie.

Mazel tov, Sadie, mazel tov.

Thank you.

No, you're gonna run for president now?

Or even mayor of New York?

Signorina.

Scusa.

Sadie, one moment, please.

I'm very busy now, Marcello.

I've got to shop for
my mother and get home.

Yes, Christmas Eve, the
policemen they make a big party

for the neighborhood, everybody come.

I was wondering dearest
Sadie, if you would,

if you would be there too?

I have more on my mind than parties.

Yes, but you dance as well as you march.

Look Marcello...

â™« A girl with a drive
and a fellow with a dream

â™« Are like pickled herring
with vanilla ice cream

â™« So, as unromantic as my words may seem

â™« We don't go together at all

â™« My big loud mouth and your quiet ways

â™« Are like August evenings
with December days

â™« Are like corned beef and
cabbage topped with mayonnaise

â™« We don't go together at all

â™« We're like chicken soup

â™« And a slice of ham

â™« We're the big bad wolf

â™« And the little lamb

â™« Like a picnic lunch

â™« That's ruined by a sudden squall

â™« We don't, no we don't

â™« No we don't go together at all

â™« Like an overcoat

â™« And a hot July

â™« Like a bowl of borscht

â™« And a pizza pie

â™« Like if I asked you

â™« To come to the policemen's ball

â™« We don't, no we don't

â™« No we don't go together at all

â™« An onion roll at a Mayfair tea

â™« Like a march by Sousa in a minor key

â™« So forget all the magic
that was meant to be

â™« We don't go together at all

â™« A stable boy and a suffragette

â™« Are about as peculiar as a pair can get

â™« So it's, oh, such a pity

â™« That we even met

â™« We don't go together at all

â™« But, I like your spunk

â™« And I like your pride

â™« So I'll still be there

â™« Marching at your side

â™« So, I guess, my friend

â™« We must admit the simple fact

â™« That opposites

â™« Oh yes opposites

â™« Attract

But Da, I haven't even
told you about the rally

after Sadie's speech or nothing.

I'll hear about it some other time.

Bye child.


You know I'd like to
stay with you, Princess.

But, if I'm late, I'll be docked for sure.

(mouth clicking)

Mrs. North, evening.

Good evening.

Looks like it's just
the two of us tonight.

All that walking, all of us
gathered there in the square.

It was exhilarating, wasn't it?

I've never seen so
many people in one place

in all of my life.

I was just thinking how much my husband

would've enjoyed it.

He so loves high spirits.

My mother too.

Well, there will certainly
be many more good times

after your mother comes over from Ireland.

Yeah.

Ah, who am I kidding?

I'll never see her again.

Oh, of course you will, Nora.

It's been over a year.

She probably won't even recognize me.

You remember what she
looks like, don't you?

Of course.

She has red hair, sorta
brown red, like a penny.

Like mine.

(somber music)

And, she has freckles on
her arms and on her cheeks.

And, two right up under her eye.

She probably looks different now anyway.

She misses you just
as much as you miss her.

She thinks about you just as often,

maybe even more.

Yeah?

Can you keep a secret, Nora?

I'm missing someone too.

Someone who's also very far away.

And, when I'm missing
someone as I am right now,

you know what I do?

Well...

I look up at the night sky
and find our special star.

And, with every twinkle,
I know that the one I love

is thinking of me.

You think my mother's
thinking of me right now too?

I know she is, kiddo.

Oh, Mrs. North, look.

Ever seen the Vaudeville show?

No, but shall we buy a ticket?

Are you kidding?

It costs two bits.

Oh.

Come on.

(lively music)
(crowd chattering)

Oh, aren't they something?

Oh, I must say, they're a rare talent.

(audience applauding)

(audience cheering)

Oh, Maud and Claude.

I'm seen 'em a million times!

(Claude whistling)

Come on, Nora.

Out you go.

Before I gotta start charging you.

Oh, just another minute, Sean.

My friend ain't seen it before.

(Claude whistling)

Aye, you've got moxie,
Nora, I'll give you that.

But, I don't wanna lose my job.

All right, we're going.

Don't bust your suspenders.

Thank you very much, Sean.

(Claude whistling)

(audience applauding)

[Man] And, that's the last time.

Good night!

(door slamming)

Hey, look it.

Will you look at all this stuff.

(Sadie whistling)

â™« Whistle

(Sadie whistling)

â™« When you feel that no one is near

(Sadie whistling)

â™« Whistle

(Sadie whistling)

â™« And you'll find me standing right here

(Sadie whistling)

â™« Here to help smooth out the wrinkles

â™« Here to make loneliness end

â™« It'll do you a lot of good

â™« Knowing you've got a good friend

â™« And all you have to do is whistle

(Sadie whistling)

â™« And you'll find me holding your hand

(Sadie whistling)

â™« When life

â™« Doesn't go the way that you planned

(Sadie whistling)

â™« Whatever rut you get stuck in

â™« You'll feel me pulling you through

â™« And then and forevermore

â™« You'll hear me whistling for you

â™« Whistle

â™« When you feel that no one is near

â™« Whistle

â™« And you'll find me standing right here

â™« Here to help smooth out the wrinkles

â™« Here to make loneliness end

â™« It'll do you a lot of good

â™« Knowing you've got a good friend

â™« Whatever rut you get stuck in

â™« You'll feel me pulling you through

â™« And then and forevermore

â™« You'll hear me whistling for

(throat clearing)

(Sadie whistling)

(Mrs. Claus whistling)

(both whistling)

â™« And, all you have to do is whistle

â™« And, you'll find me holding your hand

â™« When life

â™« Doesn't go the way that you planned

â™« Whatever rut you get stuck in

â™« You'll feel me pulling you through

â™« And then and forevermore

â™« You'll hear me whistling for

â™« You

(both whistling)

(crowd applauding)

[Woman] They're good!

Hold up.

Now, just where do you think
you're going with that tree?

We ain't stealing it, I swear.

Oh.

We're just taking it over to Tavish's.

[Girl] Nobody else wanted it.

[Boy] It's ours free and clear.

Oh it is, is it?

Well, we'll have to see about that.

And, in the meantime, I'll
be taking it, thank you.

I beg your pardon, officer,

but these are very hard-working children.

And, if they say that they
have not stolen that tree,

then I believe them.

Oh, I see.

So, they have you fooled
now as well, have they?

Listen here, Doyle--

Uh, Nora.

Officer Doyle.

Look, I promise I ain't
gonna kick you no more, okay?

Okay, I ain't gonna throw
no more eggs at you either.

So, can we have the lousy tree?

Well, it is a bit of a
scrawny old thing, isn't it?

Take it.

Thank you, officer.

Mrs. North, I was wondering, ma'am,

seeing as you take to the children so,

maybe you'd be interested
in buying a ticket

for the policemen's benefit.

It'll be on over in Foley's Saloon.

And besides, we can't have
you spending Christmas Eve

by yourself, can we?

Well, it wouldn't be the fist time.

But, it sounds lovely.

And, I'll take two tickets.

Okay.

That'll be 50 cents, ma'am.

And, there's something that
you could do for me, officer.

Ma'am?

You see the second
ticket is for my landlady,

Mrs. Lowenstein, and
I'd very much like you

to deliver her ticket to her personally.

Me?

Oh, I don't think herself wants
much to do with me, ma'am.

I wonder if she might not
be a little bit afraid of you.

Afraid of me?

Oh.

Well, I wish to God some
of it'd rub of on that one.

I told you, Doyle, I reformed.

Oh yes.

I'll believe that when I see it.

Well, I'll do that for you, ma'am.

Good night to you now.

Mrs. North, come on.

I was just telling the kids
about your idea for tomorrow.

Yes, well Sadie gave me the notion.

Tomorrow, we all work as slowly

as we possibly can.

It'll drive Tavish crazy.

So, that's the plan okay?

Tomorrow, slow as molasses.

Everybody got it?

[Children] Got it.

But, what if Tavish gets mad?

What if we get scared?

â™« Then all you have to do is whistle

â™« And you'll find me holding your hand

â™« When life

â™« Doesn't go the way that you planned

â™« Whistle

â™« When you feel that no one is near

(children whistling)

(somber music)

(Santa sighs)

(loud knocking)
Chief?

Come in.

Surprise!

(lively music)

Okay fellas, bad idea.

Well, we'll be leaving now.

I said we'll be leaving now.

Goodbye.

Merry Christmas.

[Girl] We're going, we're going.

(speaking foreign language)

Okay!

Gee whiz.

Not even one little ho, ho, ho?

Ho.

(bells jingling)

Look chief, she's gonna be back.

We've been together
from the very beginning.

Without her I feel like, I feel like

there's no such thing as Santa Claus.

If only I'd taken the time to tell her

what she means to me.

Why don't you tell her now?

Now?

Millions of children write
letters to you every year.

Maybe it's time for Santa to write one.

We don't even know where she is.

Maybe just getting the
words on paper would help.

It's just a thought.

(somber flute music)

â™« Dear Mrs. Santa Claus

â™« Wherever you are

â™« I'm without you as lost

â™« As some little star

â™« You're not there when I call

â™« And, so everything's all askew

â™« So I guess little wife

â™« That the joy in my life is you

â™« Dear Mrs. Santa Claus

â™« How I hope you can see

â™« From now on

â™« What a drastic change there will be

â™« So, I wish on the moon

â™« You'll come home to me soon

â™« Because

â™« You'll never know how Santa

â™« Misses Mrs. Claus

(bells chiming)

(horse hooves clomping)

My fancy customer from uptown.

So, now she decides she
don't want red after all.

Hmm!

(loud knocking)

Oh, Sadie.

I was wondering is your mother in?

Oh, Mrs. Lowenstein.

Officer, Your Honor.

She's a good girl.

She didn't mean to start nothing.

Well, from what I've been told,

she started plenty.

Oh no!

Sure did my own mother
go up there to Union Square

to hear them all cheering for your Sadie.

Susan MacAnthony, that one.

See Mama.

Oh, and by the way, Mrs. L,
somebody bought you a ticket

for our precinct Christmas party.

It'll be on over in
Foley's Saloon, so it will.

Who is this does such a thing?

Well, let's just say
it's your own Secret Santa.

And, it'd be giving myself and to the lads

at the precinct much pleasure

if our favorite hostess could attend.

Me, you're talking about?

Sure, who else?

So, we'll be seeing
you Christmas Eve then?

Good day to you both.

(slow music)

No, my dumplings, I
think a proper slowdown

would be even slower.

Slowly.

Oh that's perfect, Emilio.

Fine.

You think this is really gonna work?

It's better than do
nothing and freezing.

But, we've got to stick
together like glue, Fritzie.

It's only when the wheels turn together

that the train can move.

(train clattering)

Oh.

And, how are my little elves today?

What, may I ask, is happening here?

Busiest week of the
busiest season and I see

four, five, six trains.

Three teddy bears.

Mrs. North, I demand
an explanation at once.

(cane clacking)

I believe that it's the cold air

that is slowing up down, Mr. Tavish.

Perhaps some coal on the
fire would pick up the pace.

I'm on to you, Mrs. North.

This little slowdown is
your handiwork, isn't it?

Oh, not just mine,
it's all of us together.

[Children] Yeah, that's
right, together, yeah.

Well then, it's my pleasure
to inform all of you together

that you'll be spending
Christmas Day right here!

[Children] No!

Oh now just a moment, Mr. Tavish.

What possible use could
all the children be

to you on Christmas?

I mean, all of the toys
will have been delivered.

Clean up, Mrs. North.

A good scrubbing down of
all the walls and floors.

[Children] No!

Now children, remember,
stick together like the wheels

on a train.

(children chattering)

I will let you off an
hour early for Christmas

if you tell me did Mrs.
North put you up to this?

Yeah, she's the brains
behind the whole thing.

She made us do it.

[Boy] It was her.

Then she took Christmas
away from you, didn't she?

Shall I let her go?

[Children] Yes!

Find you a new supervisor?

[Children] Yes!

There you have it, Mrs.
North, democracy in action.

Now, get out!

[Man] Careful with those.

[Man] Okay watch it.

Nora, I am so sorry.

It's not your fault.

To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't have minded

working on Christmas.

I hate Christmas anyway.

Oh Nora, you can't mean that.

I'm afraid I do.
(dog barking)

Without my mother here, it's
just another day of the week.

Well, I know just what you mean,

but Christmas or not, people
shouldn't have to work

under those conditions.

Well, we tried.

Well, thank you for standing
up for me with Mr. Tavish.

That took moxie.

Well, I guess I better
start looking for another job

or we'll never have
enough to bring my mother

and my brother over.

When I think of those poor
children working so hard,

their little fingers turning to icicles.

Nora, there must be
something that we can do.

â™« Whatever rut you get stuck in

â™« You'll feel me pulling you through

â™« And then and forevermore more

â™« You'll hear me whistling for you



(dynamic music)

(lively music)

Always wanted to do that.

Mmm, Auggie Tavish.

Right, sweetheart, the coast is clear.

Hey, how'd you do that?

Oh, little trick my husband taught me.

Anybody see ya?

Not yet.

We should've stuck with Mrs. North.

Then we'd be out of our jobs.

Yeah, but at least we
wouldn't be freezing.

Ah, quit your bellyaching.

The slowdown didn't work.

And it didn't work because--
It didn't work because

we didn't believe in ourselves enough.

[Boy] Mrs. North.

[Girl] What are you doing here?

You better not let Tavish find you.

Tavis don't scare us,
does he, Mrs. North?

The only way we'll succeed with Tavish,

is if you children stick together.

Not that again.

Well, not just the children in here,

but all of the children
in the entire city.

What if you told every
boy and girl in New York

that Tavish Toys fall apart
the day after Christmas?

What if everyone knew that
little children suffered

to make them.

I'm talking about a strike,
a boycott, citywide.

And I want to know who's with me.

Mr. Tavish ain't gonna like that.

He'll just fire us and hire other kids.

Oh, not when they find out how shabbily

you children have been treated.

Nobody cares about kids from Avenue A.

Well, I care, Henry,
and I care very much.

And, I know that others will too.

But, we've got to tell them.

Now, who will join me?

I will!

Big surprise.

And, what about the rest of you?

Will one more join in?

Will someone else say strike?

Who will help get Tavish
Toys off the shelves?

Strike!

He talks!

If Emilio's in, I'm in too.

And I say strike.

Me too.

Hey, move over, you aren't in before me.

Strike.

[Children] Strike!

Strike, strike, strike, strike,

strike, strike, strike.

[Nora] Take Tavish Toys off the shelves.

Don't buy Tavish Toys.

[Children] Strike, strike, strike.

(lively music)

(neighbors shouting)

Thank you very much.

Sorry, lady!

Here are some Tavish Toys for you.

[Child] Oh, thank you.

(lively music)

[Nora] Take Tavish Toys off the shelves.

Tavish Toys aren't built to last.

You know, darling, I
may have underestimated

the difficulty of your job.

[Nora] Tavish toys are defective.

[Mayor] As mayor, I pledge
that no child will ever again

work under deplorable
conditions like those

of the Tavish Toy Company.

[Photographer] Over here, Mr. Mayor.

(crowd applauding)

Right here, please.

(flash powder exploding)

[Paperboy] Extra, extra.

Children's crusade
closes down Tavish Toys.

Read all about it.

Extra, extra.

(dramatic music)

Mrs. North!

(toys clattering)

There's an outcry for child labor laws

all over New York.

Thanks to you, Mrs. North.

Oh, you were the inspiration, Sadie.

Another picture of your
father, may he rest in peace.

And, my grandmother's candlesticks.

Look, Sadie.

Only one candlestick now.

The other was lost.

It's beautiful.

So, Mama, tell me,
you're unpacking your bag.

Does this mean we'll
be staying here awhile?

What?

You don't like America?


Oh, my mother's broach.

I think I'll wear it to the
policemen's party tonight.

You're going to the
Christmas party, Mama?

I got a ticket, so why shouldn't I go?

You're coming, Mrs. North?

Oh, I wouldn't miss it (chuckles).

And, this is what you're wearing?

Hmm?


(crowd chattering)
(upbeat music)

Ah, Mrs. North, I have good news.

Eh, Cupid, his leg is all fixed.

(sighs) Oh, thank you, Marcello.

Thank you.

(crowd applauding)

Everyone, may I have
your attention, please?

May I, please?

Thank you.

I know it may seem unusual, a Jewish girl

making a Christmas toast.

(crowd chattering)

But, as most of you know,
I have the biggest mouth

on Avenue A.

(crowd lauding)

Oh no.

I'd like to thank
someone we've only known

a very short while, but who
has already given so much

to me and especially to the children.

Mrs. North, you've been
our good luck charm.

Come to think of it,
what you've really been

is our Santa Claus.

Mrs. Santa Claus.

Right (chuckles).

Here's to the Mrs.
Santa Claus of Avenue A.

(crowd applauding)

Brava, brava.

Brava.

(slow dance music)

[Boy] May I have this dance?

(horse hooves clomping)

Nicky?

It's only me.

Officer Doyle, Mrs. North.

What are you doing up there
in the cold all by yourself?

Oh, I was just looking for a star.

Good night to you now.

And, Merry Christmas.

(tinkling music)

â™« Every time a star is falling

â™« Someone that you love is calling

â™« He needs me

â™« Yes, he needs me

â™« Don't even ask me how I know

â™« I know

â™« When he calls me

â™« My heart hears him

â™« And tells me that it's time

â™« For me to go

â™« He's my world

â™« And I am his

â™« He's my world

â™« And journey's end

â™« Is where he is

â™« And his laughter

â™« Is my laughter

â™« And tells me what I'm living for

â™« And so, if he needs me

â™« I'll go

â™« 'Cause I need him

â™« Much more

I have to leave now, sweetheart.

All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

Well, I'm afraid not.

You see, I'm needed back home.

But you can't go, not yet.

I'm afraid I have to.

But, I haven't forgotten
about the Christmas presents

for you and for the others.

Am I ever going to see you again?

Oh, I hope so.

But, until then, remember, just look up

at the night sky and you'll know

when I'm thinking about you.

â™« He's my world

â™« And I am his

â™« He's my world

â™« And journey's end is where he is

â™« And his laughter

â™« Is my laughter

â™« And tells me what I'm living for

â™« And so, if he needs me

â™« I'll go

â™« 'Cause I need him

â™« Much more

Cupid?

(horse whinnying)

Comet?

Donder?

Where are you boys?

(horse whinnying)

Oh.

(ominous music)

Missing something, Mrs. North?

Or should I say, Mrs. Claus?

Oh, how did you know?

Oh, I've had my suspicions all along.

First, there was your
knowledge of toy-making.

And, then the name, Mrs. North,

as in North Pole.

Nice touch.

And, when I realized you'd
come down the chimney,


(sighs) Mr. Tavish, without the reindeer

the children won't be able
to receive their toys.

(horse whinnying)

Pity.

But, you'll be ruining Christmas.

Precisely.

By morning, all of New York
will come crawling back

to Augustus P. Tavish.

Of course.

Poor little Auggie Tavish.

You wrote to Santa
asking for a stuffed bear

back in 1872, was it?

And, Santa brought you
the most beautiful bear.

It had a vest with a satin lining.

But, then you never wrote to him again.

You mean, Santa noticed that?

Oh, he mentioned it several times.

Well, you see, my step
brother, he stole my bear

on Christmas Day.

And, you loved it so.

And, you thought you'd never
have another one like it.

Yes, that's right.

So, you wanted to ruin
every child's Christmas

just the way yours had been ruined.

Yes, it's true.

I can't deny.

Well, Auggie, you don't have to destroy

anyone's Christmas ever again.

Here, dear.

Just like the one you lost,
right down to the satin vest.

And, remember, it's not the
gift itself that matters.

It's the love behind it.

Thank you.

Would you take me to my reindeer now?

Of course.

And, tell Santa I said hello.

Of course (chuckles).

Oh!

Christmas Eve and the
worst night of my life.

Ah, there's still time.

You have to believe.

Hello.

Whoa, boys.

(upbeat music)

So sorry I'm late.

If only you'd known
how worried I've been.

Oh, did you miss me, Nick?

More than you could ever know.

Where in the world have you been?

Oh, you better hurry, kiddo.

Kiddo?

Oh, that's New York talk.

I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

Tonight, the children are waiting for you.

Here, here.

Mustn't catch cold, must we.

Now, off you go.

I'll be here tomorrow morning
just like I always am.

Anna, close your eyes.

And keep them closed.

[Elf] Excuse me, Mrs. Claus.

Who is that?

What are you doing with my...

Arvo, what are you doing?

Earrings.

[Mrs. Claus] What is all this?

I have a surprise for you.

But first, you're going to
have to put on something warm.

Open your eyes now.

Oh, Nick, Nick,

it's beautiful.
(dramatic music)

This year, Anna, come with me.

Oh, don't be silly.

And, this year, I want
to use your new map.

You are?

Step lively, Mrs. Claus,
children are waiting.

Well, when you put it that way.


(reindeer groaning)

(elves chattering)

[Santa] Oh, so sorry, Anna.

Oh, this is so exciting (giggles).


All right, then.

On Dasher.

Come on, Anna, you must know this by now.

On Dancer.

On Prancer.

On Vixen.

On Comet.

Oh, how awful, I forget who's next.

Cupid.

Oh how silly.

How could I have forgotten
Cupid (chuckles).

On Cupid.

[Both] On Donder and Blitzen.

(both laughing)

(bells jingling)

[Santa] Merry Christmas, Anna.

[Mrs. Claus] Merry Christmas, Nicky.

â™« Through a navy blue night

â™« Crowned with shimmering stars

â™« To the kids of the world
I'll be paying my annual call

â™« But, now that you're sitting

â™« Beside me

â™« We'll have the best Christmas of all

â™« Flying over the clouds

â™« Floating under the moon

â™« As we watch and we wait

â™« For the first chimney top to appear

â™« But, now that you're sitting

â™« Beside me

â™« We'll have the best, Happy New Year

â™« Though the wind may be strong

â™« I will never complain dear

â™« I'm happy as long

â™« As there's you and my reindeer

â™« Through a navy blue night

â™« Crowned with shimmering stars

â™« In a moment I know

â™« That the first little
snowflake will fall

â™« But, now that you're sitting

â™« Beside me

â™« We'll have the best Christmas of all

â™« Though the frost in the air

â™« Means a change in the weather

â™« But, what do we care

â™« When we're flying together

(both laughing)

Oh look, we're coming
up on New York City.

[Mrs. Claus] I know, Nicky.

Nora, come.

(Mrs. Lowenstein crying)

(loud knocking)

[Nora] Mama!

Nora!

Oh.

â™« When you're no longer kids
and have kids of your own

â™« You'll remember what
somebody said to you

â™« When you were small

â™« As long as you love one another

â™« You'll have the best Christmas of all

â™« As long as you love one another

â™« You'll have the best Christmas

â™« The best Christmas of all

("The Best Christmas of
All" by Jerry Herman)
