["Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika"]

And so we commit one of our own,
dearest Rika,

child of the folk,

to the beloved earth
that we call home.

South Africa.

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

[speaking foreign language]

[somber music]

[mourners chattering]

Gogo says that when you die

you will fly with the eagles
to your ancestors.

[soft music]

Come.

See, there.

[eagle whistling]

Rika.

[eagle whistling]

Rika, Rika, look at me.

[ominous music]

[plane engine roaring]

[dramatic music]

[sirens wailing]

Several black men
killed in a shootout

with police last week.

A member of the police force
was hit by shrapnel

from a Soviet-made grenade.

He died later from the injuries.

Troops were called in today

to restore order in the bureau,

which turned violent when a
foreign news reporter

was stoned to death.

His vehicle was
later set alight.

According to a police spokesman,

this unrest will only
serve to prolong

the current state of emergency.

Figures in from the bureau...

[mellow, sensual music]

I said, kick for fuck's sake.

Five, six, seven,
eight and kick.

Okay, okay, girls, that's it.

Mediocre.

Go away and practice.

Go home, go to bed.

We've got three weeks.

Marcel is now angling to get
us to wear G-strings

covered front here
for the finale.

But you don't honestly
believe this government

would allow us to float
around on stage

wearing nylon snatchers, huh?

Yeah, I do.

Well girl, you can always go
back to the ballet.

What ballet?

That's not what this
country wants to see.

Uh-uh.

Your tits and my ass.

That's what they wanna see.

Well, lover, you can be
thankful for that.

It's when they stop
wanting to see them.

That's when you know
it's all over.

What?

I went to church, with
Steph's parents.

Can you believe that?

Oh God.
Oh, exactly.

They were so fucking weird.

Hardly spoke.

And Steph, it's kind of like, he
was scared of them.

Like he worshiped them
or something.

It was like there, right in
front of me where he came from.

If I could just get
through to him.

If I could just soften him
somehow, then...

You think too much, darling.

I don't know.

He's changed.

[dramatic music]

Sorry, missus.

I'm sorry he fell.

Bye.

Bye.
Come, Rhona.

[car engine revving]

[car engine stuttering]

Shit.

Need a push?

Would you, please?

Thanks.

[car engine revving]

Thanks.

Can I give you a lift somewhere?

No.

I don't think so.

Unless you want to drive me
to the township.

Oh.

Right.

Well, bye.

And thanks again.

[speaking foreign language]

[soft music]

Shit.

I didn't think you'd
arrived yet.

How long have you got?

Two days.

Two nights.

[soft music]

I missed you.

[gentle flute music]

He was about 10 years old.

I had seen him many times,
perhaps hundreds.

He was small for his age, and
seemed deeply afraid.

His future, you could say,
seemed uncertain.

In fact, from where I stood,
it seemed doomed.

[gentle music]

One day, they will slaughter us,
my boy.

They will overwhelm us.

Yeah, and on that day, it will
be up to you to protect us.

Our country.

[speaking foreign language]

We will look to you to
protect us one day.

[somber music]

[upbeat music]

[playful clamoring]

[singing in foreign language]

Check your little babies.

What'd you say?

What did you say?

Tront.

Tront.
What's your problem?

No fucking problem, I dig
your little...

Hey, listen.

You're looking for kak, you come
to the right place.

I'm not looking for anything,
man.

Fuck you.

Fuck off, you're gonna get hurt.

Fuck off.


Fucking sissies, you're acting
like babies, man.

Fuck you, Tront.

This is how you are now.

Wait until you hate the ground.

Fucking bullets flying in at you
from fucking everywhere.

Bam, bam, bam.

Coming at you from nowhere.

You're gonna kak, my boy.

You're gonna kak big.

Light this, man.

You'll be lucky if we
don't bring you all

back home in bits.

In a bag.

[upbeat drum music]
[background chattering]

Hey.

Take your fucking dog.

It's not my dog, commandant.

That's it. What did you say?

[speaking foreign language]

Yeah, well, take a [speaking
foreign language] off my wheel.


[dog barks]

[background chattering]

Hey, good boy.

[speaking foreign language]

Keep it up.

Now, piss off.

Bye bye.

Still looking at these pictures,
hey ma?

You were a funny looking child.

You still are.

Hey, he would have been
good for you.

Instead, look at you.

You at 28 years old
with no wife.

What's the matter with you?

I'm tired.

Tired? Tired?

You're always tired.

[heavy knocking]

At this time of the night.

Hey, good evening, mother.

I'm not your mother..

Hey Vusi, man. What's happening?

Are you coming?

Where?

The tavern, man.

[speaking foreign language]

Get out of here you
bloody hoodlum.

Hold on, ma.

Bingo, I'm coming.

At first you're tired.

Now you're going off
into the night.

[speaking foreign language]


That guy was a fucking bull,
hey?

Gotcha.

You shouldn't be on the streets,
my China.

Come on, leave him, man.

Where's your dumb pass.

There.

That's not a pass.

This is a pass.

Right.

From now on, you will no
longer be required

to think for yourselves.

You can leave it up to us.

We will do it for you.

'cause believe me, when you
come face to face

with this bastard 20 miles into
the Okavango Swamp,

unless you hear me now,
you will be dead.

Tront.
Yeah, man.

See you Os, okay.

Oh man, where are you going?

Can't you see we're just getting
all warmed up here?

No, man.

Better get back.

Stick is waiting for me.

See you Os.

Cheers, Wes.

Give her one for me, yeah.

Check you Oosthuizen, on
the plane, yeah?

[speaking foreign language]

[upbeat music]

[background chattering]

Hey, bra.

Where are you going?

Home.

[speaking foreign language]

Too much juice?

Hey, Bingo.

This way of yours.

You're gonna get yourself
killed, my friend.

My way is the only way.

Direct action.

We're building something here.

And you, what are you doing?

You can't work for the
Boer forever.

Here is where you
have to put him.

So what?

We have to die to be free?

If necessary.

And that doesn't make you angry?

All our lives living like dogs.

And the only way to get our
dignity back is to die for it?

My friend, these Boers,
they've never changed.

Check their schools out.

They don't learn our history.

[speaking foreign language]

straight to the army,
brainwashed.

If we have to die

so that another generation
can live in dignity,

then so be it.

You got to be here, my bra,
with us.

You got to be here.

But you know all that.

You know all that.

Come.

Free your mind.

[somber music]

[car engine revving]

Hello, honey.

How are you?

How's the dancing, eh sweetie?

Having good time?

Steph, come.

Now, you be good, huh?

Come, leave it.

Hey.

Fucking O, piece of shit.

Hey, what's wrong with you.

Hey.

[upbeat music]

What's wrong with you?

Fuck you.

[singing in foreign language]


Hey, hey.

You wanna go?

You wanna see?

Hey, baby?

What?

Nothing.

It's not pulling teeth.

What are you thinking?

I was just looking at you,
that's all.

Tell me.

Sometimes you remind me of my
sister, sometimes.

Rika?

Yeah.

[soft music]

Enough now.

You were very close to her,
weren't you?

Yeah.

She's with the eagles now.

What?

What did I do wrong?

Nothing.

Nothing.

[train rumbling]

[somber flute music]

Fire bombings earlier today.

Sources close to the community
based organizations

in the strife torn...

[dogs barking]

Township's burning.

Fucking army.

So why don't you join the End
Conscription Campaign

if you hate the army so much?

You're fucking crazy.

How'd you get up that way?

Even if I could, I'd
never live it down.

The okes would rag on
me for years.

My parents would
fucking kill me.

So end conscription that.

South fucking Africa.

Why do you hate the army
so much, Steph?

Enough now, hey.

Asshole.

You never fucking talk to me.

You wanna know why I
hate the army?

I hate running five
miles every day

with a telephone pole
on my shoulder.

Me and that telephone pole,

we come first every time.

I don't love waking
up in the dark.

Without you.

And I hate...

What Stephy?

What do you hate?

[soft music]

That I can't get cool with it.

I can't.

What?

It's getting crazy, huh?

Hey.

Soldier boy.

Yeah.

I may hate the army but you
smack them army boys, hey?

You're gonna be late

for roll call.
Roll call, yeah.

Attention.

About-turn.

By the left, quick march.

Three months.

Three months, and I'll be
here waiting for you.

Now go.

Go.

Three months.

Yeah.

You take care.

I worry about you when
I'm not here.

Yeah. Yeah.

You just come home, okay?

Yeah. Promise.

[soft music]

Can you see all right?

Yeah, kind of.

Would it help if I turn
on the lights?

No, I can see.

Do you think it might be the...

Are you okay?

No, no I'm fine.

Thank you.
Sorry.

Look, leave the car.

Don't worry about me.

Don't you have to catch a train?

I mean, won't they make
trouble for you

being out on the streets with
the curfew and everything?

Yeah, they will.

But I think I missed it already.

The train.

So what do you do now?

I find a place somewhere.

I'm gonna have to find
a place anyway

when the show starts.

Might as well start now.

No, no, no, no.

You don't have to do that.

You could...

Look, I don't live too
far from here.

You can stay at my place
tonight if you want.

No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

No, no, no. I have a
sleeping bag.

You could sleep on the floor.

Yeah, it should be okay.

Look, I insist. It was my
fault kind of.

Look, the thing is,

I've never had to walk home from
here alone at night.

And well, it's a bit of
a dodgy area.

I'd appreciate the company.

Yeah. It's no problem.

It's okay.

It's okay. Come.

Come in.

I don't think I have any foam,

but I think these things have
their own padding, don't they?

Please, come in.

Sit down, make
yourself comfortable.

Okay.

So tea, Rooibos?

Okay.

Do you think...

It's just...

It's just that...

I'll go.

No, no, no, no.

Don't be silly.

It's just...

If they found me in your flat,

it might not look right.

What if someone saw us come in?

So I'll go.

No, no, please, please don't.

It's okay.

You know, it's just,

you hear about people calling
the police sometimes, but...

You know what?

Fuck 'em.

[soft music]

Oh, here.

Well, thank you, Emma.

You called me Emma.

That is what people do.

Call each other by their names.

It sounds silly,

but no black man has ever
called Emma before.

It's nice.

Hey, I'm glad you liked it.

That's the first time I've
called a white woman

by her first name.

Strange country, huh?

That it takes so long just to
get to know a woman's name.


Well, goodbye.

Bye, Joseph.

It's Vusisizwe.

My real name.

Vusisizwe.

That's beautiful.

What does it mean?

It means to wake.

To wake up.

Oh, well goodbye Vusi...

Hey, Vusi to you.

Vusi is good enough.

Okay. Goodbye, Vusi.

[somber music]

[Vusisizwe VOICEOVER] His
future, you could say,

seemed uncertain.

In fact, from where I stood,
it seemed doomed.

And this little boy, his
name was Vusisizwe.

His teachers, they all told him,

"One day, you will go out and
work in the white man's world.

In his kitchens, and
his gardens.

And Vusisizwe is much too
complicated for them.

Better that you use a
name like Joseph.

They like that."

But then this little
boy said no.

His father had told him that his
name was Vusisizwe

and that he should be
proud of it.

It carried the spirit of
his ancestors.

It belonged to him.

But you see, when this boy
began to grow up,

he found that he slowly began
to lose this spirit,

his rebellion.

And he found in order to
make a living,

that he would have to go and
work in the white man's world.

And that is what he did.

And every night he
tried to dream,

to remember that child,
remember his spirit,

but no matter how hard he tried,

he just couldn't.

Until the man realized that
inside he was dead

and that all that would ever
come were the nightmares

and a great, great fear for his
people, for their future.

Oh, what the fuck is that?

Looks like a fucking rat
wearing a G-string.

Look, it's not my idea,
all right?

Marcel loves the finale.

Just that he thinks
that this thing

will give it that extra
little edge of-

Disaster?

Look, just think about it.

Yeah, right.

All right, Joseph.

Oh God.
Oh thank you, Fonz.

You prick.

You must have wondered what
happened to it.

I thought I dropped it
on the train.

I'm sorry I didn't give it back
to you right away.

But I did read some of it.

And I just have to say, I
really loved it.

I couldn't put it down.

Oh well, it's just a
children's story.

Still have to change the names.

Finish it, all that kinda stuff.

What will you do with it?

What will I do with it?

Yeah. You could publish it.

[Vusisizwe laughing]

I don't know. You really could.

It's good. I wasn't
just saying that.

Oh, no.

It's just for me, I guess.

It's just my thoughts,
that's all.

Like I said, it's just
a kid's story.

Oh, you see?

I thought it was much
more than that.

I mean, you know, not that a
kid's story makes it any...

That's not mine.

I mean...

No, no, no, it's not mine.

I mean you saw what
happened there.

You saw him give that
to us and...

No, no.

I know. I know.

All right, thanks.

[both laughing]

Shit.

Well, goodbye.

Hey.

How about a cup of tea
and a sleeping bag

in exchange for an escort home,
huh?

A deal?

Tea sounds good.

[phone ringing]

Hello?
Yeah, Em.

Listen, we drop tomorrow night.

I just wanted to hear you.

I wanted to ask you something.

What?

What did you wanna ask?

Let's do it.

What?

Get married like we dreamed of?

You and me.

You're crazy?

Yeah.

I know.

So listen, does that
mean you will?

Will you?

I suppose.

You suppose? What do you
mean you suppose?

[soft music]

I suppose.

Yes.

You're sure?

Yes.

So we'll do it then?

Yeah, yeah, we will.

We will.

Okay then.

Look, I better get back.

I'm on guard duty tonight.

Look, we'll talk later, huh?

You take care of yourself, okay?

Yeah.

Yeah, I will.

I'll see ya.

Bye.

Em, Em!

Shit.

Yeah.

Are you okay?

Yeah, yeah.

No, no, no, no. I'm okay.

Come.

[siren wailing]

I envy you.

You envy me?

Yeah.

You know why I do?

Because you belong here,

and this is your country.

It's yours too.

You're born here.

My parents are from England.

So it's always been this kind of

safety raft, floating out
there somewhere,

just in case things
get a bit too...

Black.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Your story really got to me.

[somber music]

You must really hate them

for what they're doing
to this country.

Yeah.

Of course I do.

But my love for this country,

for my people, is stronger
than that hate.

It has to be.

That's the trick, you see?

Otherwise, I'm nothing.

You know,

I really could take a close look
at that car of yours.

[Emma chuckles]

If you want me to.

What?

You are a strange man.

Thank you.

[crickets chirping]

[children giggling]

[speaking foreign language]

How many times have I
told you that?

They're like animals.

They're not like the rest of us.

You must go away, do you hear?

Before I kill you.

It's up to me to protect.

Go away. Do you hear?

Wait.

Phindi.

I'm sorry.

It's just a game.

Come back.

Okay.

Try it now.

[car engine revving]

Come.

Where?

I'll take you home.

To the township?

Well, it's where you live,
isn't it?

Yeah, it's where I live, but...

But what, huh?

You wouldn't be embarrassed to
be seen with me, would you?

No.

It's just that I don't think
it'd be a good idea.

That's all.

But if you really want to...

I do.

Okay.

[gentle music]

[singing in foreign language]

Where are you heading, ma'am?

To the township.

Township?

It's not safe for a young woman
alone such as yourself.

Look what they're doing now.

I'm not alone.

The madam is taking me home,
boss.

Yeah, well, I'd drop him
on the outskirts

and turn around and go
straight back home

if I were you, okay?

Yes, boss.

Okay?

[gentle music]

Okay.

[singing in foreign language]

[speaking foreign language]

Hi.

[somber music]

If I would have one
wish right now,

it'd be that the the nightmares
would end for you.

And never begin for them.

[upbeat music]

[singing in foreign language]

[soft music]

I'll walk you to your car.

No, I'll be okay. Really.

You go on back.

It's just over there.

Okay.

I am...

Bye.

I'll see you Monday.

Monday.

[dramatic music]

[chopper whirring]

[radio chatter]

[gentle melancholic music]

[gunfire blazing]

[man screaming]

You must go away now.

Do you hear?

Before I kill you.

It's up to me.

To protect.

Do you hear?

What the fuck's the matter
with you, Oosthuizen?

Get out now.

[gunshot blaring]

What the fuck were you doing in
there with that O?

Hey, Oosthuizen?

Look at me.

You fucking tucking
him into bed?

Listen, China, if that's how
you're gonna open it,

you're off my unit, you got it?

I'll deal with you later.

All right?

You're taking pity on
the floppies now?

Fucking moffy.

Whose side are you on?

Uh-oh.

You're not bailing.

Outta here, man.

I seen it before.

It's in your eyes, man.

Hey, you're fucking outta here?

Here.

Take that.

Fuck knows you're gonna need it.

Well, it's deep fried butter
cheese for you, my China.

[dramatic music]

[insects buzzing]

[car engine revving]

The hell's wrong, my China?

Looks like you need a little bit
of shimmy up, hey?

Rats.

You need some help?

What happened to you?

It's okay. It's okay.

I can help you.

Come on, come with me.

I'll take you just down the road
here down the farm...

I tell you what?

We can pray together.

Come on. We can pray to Jesus.

God is a Boer.

He's one of us.

That's it, my boy.

Come in, I'll help you.

Come with me, boy.

[car engine revving]

You sure you don't need
a toothbrush?

'cause I think I've got one
here somewhere.

No, I'm fine.

Are you sure?

I know I've got one, somewhere.

Thank you, no.

If the show keeps going
late like this,

we're gonna have to buy you one.

Come sleep here.

It's okay.

There's no need to sleep on the
floor, that's all.

Really, you'll be far more
comfortable here.

Look, you're my friend.

It's ridiculous you
sleeping there

when there's plenty
of room here.

It's okay.

The light.

You can turn out the light.

[solemn music]

Thank you.

For what?

For being my friend.

Well, goodnight then.

Goodnight.

[dramatic music]

[ominous music]

Baby.

Jesus.

Fuck.

On the ground, now.

Steph.
What the fuck is this?

This isn't what you think.

No, he couldn't sleep
on the floor.

Get up. Get off there.

Okay, okay.

Steph, please.

Please just stop.

Stop.

Stop, I can explain, Steph.

[dramatic music]

Shit.

Oh, shit.

Don't you look at her.

I don't want you
fucking looking her.

Three months.

Three months, soldier boy,

and I'll be waiting for you.

Try three fucking weeks.

Stephy, what happened?

What happened to you?

No, no, no, no, no, Em.

You want to know what
happened to me, fine.

But first you tell me
what happened here.

Stephy, this is Joseph.

Do you think that I want
to know his name?


He does the lights at the show.

It was late.

I said he could stay the night
because of the curfew.

We couldn't find any from...

Yeah.

Steph, nothing happened.

Really, nothing happened.

Oh yeah.

Please, please just,
just let him go.

Please.

And we can talk about this out,
all right?

And we can talk?

Yeah.

Okay, he can go.

Joseph go, get out of here.

[somber music]

One day, they will slaughter us,
my boy.

They will overwhelm us.

Yeah, and on that day, it'll be
up to you to protect us.

You take one more step and it's
tickets, my friend.

Kaput.

[Emma sobbing]

You think I can just let him
walk out of here?

AWOL from the army.

I come all this way to
see my sticky.

And what do I find?

She's in bed, with a kaffir.

No.

That's what happened to me.

Steph.

You think that I can possibly
swallow this shit?

Here.

Here, a nice piece of floor.

And here, a nice piece of floor.

But no, no, no, no, no, Emmy.

In the bed.

My fucking bed.

So let me tell you one thing,
Emmy.

No one is going anywhere

till I find out what the fuck
is going on here.

[solemn music]

You got that, my China?

No.

No.

What do you think you're
fucking doing?

Em!

Steph.

Steph, please come on now.

Come on. Talk to me.

Please.

It all seems pretty
fucking clear to me.

Okay.

[gentle music]

Come here, dance with me.

Emmy, come, come, come.

Come here.

Come here.
Steph.

Come and dance with me.

It's like we'd
dreamed we'd dance.

Steph, stop it.
At our wedding.

At the Montreal.
What are you doing?

With a band stand and
the big boys.

Just stop it.

Fuck's sake.

A fucking big white wedding.

A fucking white wedding.
Fucking stop it.

I'm gonna finish the tea.


Vusi.

Vusi...

Vusisizwe.

Vusisizwe.

Is that your name, man?

I will never work in a
white man's world.

You Os.

Stop it, please.

What?

You think if we just give this
country over to you,

everything's gonna be okay?

No, my friend.

Can't be done.

Hey, Em, I suppose

you think we should just
hand it over, hey?

No, I bet you're right.

This place is fucked away.

I mean look at us three,
sitting here.

We should be on a
beach somewhere

scopping a soccer ball.

But no, here we are.

Sitting here.

Yeah, that's funny, hey?

[soft music]

Don't you laugh.

Don't you laugh at me.

It would be nice to
be on a beach.

Yeah.

Fucking beach.

Em.

This is how it should have been,
Em.

Will you hold me, Em?

[soft music]

I wanna sleep.

I'm so fucking tired.

We'll talk in the morning.

Figure out what to do.

I'm so fucking tired.

Em.

[ominous music]

You never touch her
before you eat.

How many times have I told
you that, Stephanus?

Stephanus, are you
listening to me?

That's filthy.
That's disgusting.

They're not clean like us,
Stepahnus.

They're like animals.


Yes.

[solemn music]

Oh shit no, Em.

Where are you going, Em?

Come on, Em.

Emmy.

Quick.

Emmy, why are you doing this?

It's locked.
Where's the key?

[ominous music]

No, no, no, no, Steph.

Steph, please.

Please.

You wanna know?

Steph.
You won't be, fuck off.

Is that what you want? Fuck.

This is wrong.
Fuck.

This is so fucking wrong, Steph.

Is this close enough for you,
Em?

Joseph, I'm so sorry [sobs].

You're sorry?

For him?

[somber music]

For him?


What's the matter with you,
Oosthuizen?

Get up, now.

Taking pity on the floppies now?

[indistinct chattering]

[man laughing]

Okay.

Come on the bed.

Come, come.

Steph, what...
Shh!

Steph, what are you doing?
Shh. Shh.

Now listen, this is
what you wanted.

This.

No, no, Steph.

Start fuck her.

Take off your clothes.

No, this is not what we want.

She's my friend.

I said, no.
What's wrong, man?

You don't think she's beautiful?

Stop, Steph. Please,
don't do this.

Oh no.
Fuck her.

No.
Take your clothes off.

No, this is my friend.

No, no, Steph.

Fuck her.

No, Steph.

Steph, don't do...

Look at me, Steph.

Steph, please.

Steph, look at me.

It's me.

What are you doing?


Rules are fucking skewed with
our lives, you and me.

This is me.


God.

[solemn music]


I needed you, Em.

And you weren't here for me.

I am here for you.

I'm here for you, Steph.

No, you're not.

[birds chirping]
[dog barking]

Emmy, pass us the cigarette.

There's none left.

What's that?

I said there's none left.

Well, why don't you go
and get us some

from the corner cafe?

Come here.

From the corner cafe.

And get three Augusta's coffees.

Make sure he grinds them really
fine way I like it.

Steph.

Shh!

It's all right.

For me.

Okay.

And, get us Kit Kit.

[somber music]

Hey.

Em's getting me a Kit Kat.

Want anything?

It's okay, Em.

Just the stuff.

Don't try anything stupid.

Go now.

[somber music]

Oh, good girl.

She's a good girl, hey?

Yeah.

So you operate the lights?

Some graft, hey?

All those little titties
bouncing around.

That ain't awful, China.

How'd you do it?

How'd you manage to
get in my bed?

I tell you what.

If you did do it, you tell
me and you can go.

I swear it.

I swear it.

Stupid.

Put the gun aside

and man to man, you tell me.

'cause see, she could never tell
me something like that.

And I know you couldn't say
anything while she was here.

But now, just
between you and me.

Did you?

Shit, man. I'm not
gonna hurt her.

I love her. You know
what I mean?

I do.

I love her.

But I can't be with her anymore.

Not if she slept with a...

Someone else.

I can't.

I can't.

Is that crazy?

So I just need to know
this one thing.

[ominous music]

Did you fuck her?

Okay.

I'm getting very bored now.

Come on, you tell me.

What's your name?

Joseph?

Vusi?

Come on bra, or she'll be
back here any minute.

You gotta tell me now.

Did you fuck her?

You fucking tell me.

Brat.

Did you fuck her?

Did you fuck her?

This is one bullet I
will not touch.

You shoot me.

Did I fuck her?

You think I would tell you that?

Don't you know her?

'cause if you don't, you
really should, man.

You work it out.

But this is one thing I
will tell you.

My name is Vusisizwe Ungwenya.

Vusisizwe.

Do you know what that means?

It means, wake up.

[ominous music]

Yo fuck you, Boer.

Fuck you for the pain.

Fuck you for the pain.

Fuck you for not
knowing my name.

Fuck's sake, wake up.

'cause whether you
like it or not,

you're going to have to
live with me.

And know this.

One day, our children will go
to the same school.

And my son will fuck
your daughter,

whether you like it or not.

So wake up.

Your son, fuck my daughter?

When is that ever gonna happen?

You think we can allow that?

It's up to me to protect.

You have no idea what
they'd do to me.

You don't understand, man.

Never to touch her before
you eat, Stephanus.

Never to touch her
before you eat.

It's up to me.

You understand? Me.

Big, strong, little boy.

Big, strong, little fucking boy.

Where do you think you're going?

No wait, I need to talk to you.

It was up to me to protect.

It was up to me.

And I couldn't kill...

Not like that.

Em's right, hey?

Oh yeah.

We're so scared.

But it's my whole life, man.

If I go against that, then

I'm nothing.

[solemn music]

Nothing.

Yeah.

Shit.

What are you talking to him for?

Shh! Shh!

Fuck.

Do you think she
called the cops?

Oh, fuck up that.

Emmy.

What did you do that for, hey?

You tell him to call the cops?

You know I'm AWOL, man.

They'll throw away the key.

Why'd you have to fuck it up?

I didn't say anything, Steph.

Yeah?

Then why did he walk half
the way with you?

I don't know.

Maybe he wanted to talk-

Don't bullshit me, Emmy.

What did he say?

Nothing.

Nothing really, Steph.

Steph, please.

Just let us walk away
from here now.

Please.

I promise you we
won't tell anyone.

Us?

We?

You want to run off together?

With this guy?

Is that what you want?

Steph, it's enough now.

Enough.

Answer me.

Is that what you want?

No.

No, I just want...

Drop it, China.

Drop it.

Drop...

[gunshot blares]

[somber music]

Emmy.

Emmy.

Emmy.

Oh God.


[sirens wailing]

Mr. Oosthuizen, you have
testified that you were alone

at the time of Ms. Hughes'
death.

But the laboratory
report shows clearly

that there was another person in
the flat at the same time,

as two sets of fingerprints were
found on the rifle.

The other set, it has
been ascertained

were not those of Ms. Hughes.

So I ask you again,

was there another person
with you in the flat,

at the time of Ms. Hughes'
death?

No.

[soft music]

Out of the experience of an
extraordinary human disaster

that lasted too long, must
be born a society

of which all humanity
will be proud.

A common victory for justice,

for peace, for human dignity.

The time for the healing of
the wounds has come.

The moment to bridge the chasms
that divides us has come.

The time to build is upon us.

It's funny.

I've never wanted to grow
anything before.


[gentle music]

What's that?

A cane, man.

Hey, you're gonna need it.

Keep all those little
horses in line.

No, man.

You keep it.

You hang on to it.

The boy looked up at
the morning sky,

at the new sun

and took a deep, deep breath
and held it there.

He just wanted to keep all
those smells inside him

for a moment, and
then [whooshes]

he let the air out all at once.

Beautiful early
morning to be alive.

The boy's name is Vusisizwe.

[somber music]

Vusi, see you.

[soft melancholic music]

[singing in foreign language]
