Let's eat.

It looks delicious!

So...

You should join the training.

Of course! You said that it's
starting this afternoon.

I was absolutely going to go, of course.
That's why I'm here. No matter what.

It's probably not your first kiss at age 23.

It was just a smooch for like
middle school sweethearts.

You're panicking.

Who's panicking?

I'm not! Why would I panic over
such a petty thing!

It's like a hello.

It's like that for me too.

It's not for me.

Huh?

I don't do it as hello.

I'm not a easy guy like that.

I am...

I thought that you may feel awkward
if I put too much meaning into that.

It's not awkward, but it's...

It was like a cheer up thing for the future star,
who's just made the hardest choice in her life.

Something like that?

Then we can just enjoy the breakfast
without you laughing all weird like this right?

Ok. Let's eat.

You got $50,000 investment as soon as
your fund was decided.

I think so.

As for project B, you received $170,000
four months after.

Additionally you received $30,000 for project A.

I think I took about $200,000.

You've received $320,000 total for
Projects A, B, C, and D.

-Can I get something to drink?
-You've never made a contract for a song right?

I did because the policies sort of changed.

Anyways, we're getting onto it right now.

Where's all the money you've received?

You know there are processing costs.

All the whiskeys and wines that you drink.
Hotels that you go...

You know the world of creation, Representative Yu.

I don't think people like you understand.

I don't need to know.
And I don't want to know.

Provide evidence for your spending by next week.

You would have to admit to embezzlement
for the ones that you can't prove.

Hey man, you know?

Then you would have to first find out
if I spent all that $320,000.

What do you mean?

Exactly as I said.

You know you weren't the one that
ran this fund in the beginning.

When I got the money,
it was when the other Rep Yu was around.

That guy! Your cousin.
Yu Jae Joon.

Didn't he tell you anything?

Can you hear that? You know those guys are
pretty new themselves.

Someone like you can even call
FF or 20 Body and ...

-Let's talk after you see her!
-That's why I'm saying FF or 20 Body...

Can you even afford those guys?

If it's working with Hong Jae Yi,
who would even ask for money?

Stop using your throat but
use your breath instead!

Oh, you're here!

This is Go Eun Bi.
This is Producer Gu Jak.

Say hi.

Ms. Go Eun Bi.
Nice to meet you.

-Nice to meet you.
-Oh yes.

Shouldn't the corporations sponsor
cultural movements?

A big corporation such as this,
giving such a meager amount of money...

then asking what? Investment? Profit?

That's not right.

Is it no-smoking?

Take a look.

This is when the lead actress runs out to the
center of the stage in shock.

It's the theme song.

<i>~It's not. It's not love.
Absolutely not. ~</i>

<i>~Whenever I see you.~</i>

Your heart is being stumbled
by the man whom you thought you couldn't love.

<i>~But my heart. My love. ~</i>

<i>~Whenver I call you it swift wind blows by. ~</i>

<i>~Since when was it? Since it became silver platter. ~</i>

<i>~Since when was it?~</i>

<i>~The excitement that I'm feeling for the first time.~</i>

<i>~Even if I try to turn my head
and look away from you.~</i>

<i>~Even if I shake my body and shake
off the silver fox fur...~</i>

<i>~I find myself holding you in my arms.~</i>

<i>~Your wound that only I know.~</i>

<i>~Your wound that I hold in my arms.~</i>

I don't think I should sing it like this.

It's beating quite excitedly right?

You like the song?

Is there someone that can impress
Hong Jae Yi in Korea?

Hello!

Do you know me?

Your songs, I mean your work.
I know all of them.

Thank you. Now will you excuse us?

I have something to discuss with him.

The door was open.

We're doing lessons right now.

That's ok. I'll just leave.
You guys have your conversation.

You shouldn't play around with kids.

If you say that you're not just playing around,
with someone like that then it's insulting me.

Say what you want and leave.

Just take a seat!

If we want to cover it,
we can cover the whole thing.

You know funds with that big of a size,
taking some money out for mutual benefits is...

Isn't it Father? When can there be a
deal without a broker's fee?

I said that it's not important whether you
took the money or you didn't.

The important part is whether it will be known
that you took the money or you didn't.

That's what's...

Since when were you here?
You didn't even let us know.

You were talking.

Who taught you manners...
-Sit.

I heard that you were taking care of the fund
Jae Joon used to work on.

Yes, they all expired.

I think Jae Joon made some mistakes
during the beginning of the fund.

Father those weren't mistakes.

Yes, they weren't mistakes.

If you call investing 3 to 4 times for a company
that has no intention of performing,

You should say that him doing business
at all is a mistake.

Hey!

It was a mistake. Jae Joon's mistake.

Father,

We let you run the fund believing
that you may put it back on course.

So, if you just blame Jae Joon for his mistakes,

you're just as incapable as he is.

Uncle.

In baseball, if the pitcher makes the bases loaded,

and leaves the game to the substitute pitcher,
the stats will be recorded...

Yes, on the first pitcher.
He will have the runs in his stats.

However, the pitcher that gets in the game
when the bases are loaded.

Takes a hit and losing the game is something
anyone can do.

What kind of a pitcher are you?

Are you the one that gets three strikes?

Saving the team and the face of the first pitcher?

You take the win.

Show everyone your ability.

Isn't that the way to build your career?

So, you're coming back to musicals with that song?

Umm... yeah.

If you don't like Rep Yu,
you can just do it with me alone.

As long as you say you're coming back.

Do you know what it means that you and I
are starting the musical again?

You already know clearly.

Yes. It's because I'm fully aware of what it means.

To Hong Jae Yi, musical is Bae Kang Hee.

Bae Kang Hee is musical.

That's what I'm trying to get rid of.

Help me.

Help you with what?

Help you try to get away from me?

You're the one who left me.

At that time...you know that
that was the only choice for me.

You admitted so yourself.

Because you loved yourself so much,

You chose to marry your husband.

There's no man.

No man that can have all of Bae Kang Hee.

But...

I can give you the big part.

No.

I left because I hate complicated things.
And now...

So?

Has it become simple?

Not yet.

Because of that girl earlier?

Maybe...

I don't know.
I wonder if it can be that simple.

I just hate irresponsible people
who care about nothing but themselves.

There are plenty of those people.

Especially in the field we're working on.

Talent.

If they can't use it for others,
for the world,

Then it's just useless.

That's why people like you should help them so that
they can use their talent

By investing money and giving them opportunities.

Have you gotten a call from someone?

I always get calls.

-President Han.
-Representative Yu.

Because of selfish people who only love
themselves, and who only do what they want to do,

Because of people who act and sing even
though they are starving,

We're here today.

In the process, injustice could happen.

There are situations that we can never understand.

Once the curtains unveil and the audience applauds,

you tend to forget everything.

Everything gets covered.

What do you want me to do?

You don't have to do something for me.

I'm just saying that you don't
have to be so tough on everyone.

That was sick! Did you see that?

When the lead actress came up after about 42 minutes.

I'm not a bad person. Don't hit me.

I just wanted to earn my way.
We're all the same people.

Did you memorize it by watching it just once?

That's so cool.

For people like me, it gets straight into
my head after just watching it once.

It's not something anyone can do.

What's interesting is that...

The scene right after. The poem.

The poem was from the roof scene.

What are you talking about? Do you know
how many times I've watched this?

You said it was your first time!

You said that you memorized
it after watching it once.

That's not what's important here.

The point here is that, the next scene is
the mountain scene.

It's not.

You wanna bet?

The loser gets to take everyone out
tonight for a full course dinner.

Call.

You've invested on a company
that performed once in 1991.

Now you're saying that
you've invested in their potential?

Director Lee, who has produced
"The Man of the King,"

is a man who has never produced in 15 years.

For artists, miracles seldom occur.

Representative Yu!

They say that you're the venomous snake
in the field.

You know better than anyone that Yu Jae Joon
is not the man who would invest knowing these.

How dare you to play dumb?

You always talk about honest,
public entrepreneurship.

It's always the same family business,
dirty crap kept within family.

It's negative 37% on the 50 million fund.

That's 20 million dollars.

Didn't you guys take all of these?

The agreement that we will minimize the loss on
Dae Hak Ro fund is still in effect.

I hope everyone understands that we had put in
our utmost attention to Amour Fund.

Hold on.
Let's just hear this out.

Amour Fund is still going well.

But still.

How can the 10 million dollar budget for Amour Fund
cover the loss of 50 million dollars?

Do you know what the profit should be then?

300%

Are you confident that you can make 300% profit?

Let's start all over tomorrow.

What time can you come?

We already decided to practice together.

I feel that practicing in the office is best.

Guests come to your house and stuff...

Kang Hee...

Used to be a very special person to me.

I understand very well.

Bae Kang Hee, even to me,
is a stunning person.

She really is cool.

Hey.

You should listen!

She USED TO BE a special person.

USED TO BE.

That's not the only reason.

Bok Ja too.

Anyways, I think it's best that I practice in
the office, teacher.

-Eun Bi!
-Teacher!

Like you said.

I made the hardest decision in my life.

I gave up everything for the musical.
So I want to focus only on the musical.

Goodnight.

She's saying that she thinks of me enough to
have her bothered, even for musical.

<i>Where are you?</i>

I'm wrapping it up.

<i>I heard that you defended very well.</i>

Who did you hear that from?

Good news travels fast.

It's Soo Ryung's birthday.
Sorry I can't be with you.

You want to come?

You know Jae Hoon right? Soo Ryung's fiance.

Jung Suh and Seul Ki's boyfriend.

What?

I still have to finish work here.

Sorry.

Have fun and go home safely.

Ok. You go home safely too, Sweetie.

Yeah.

I don't know.

Among the packages that's going to my place,
I think your Grandma packed some for you too.

I think she packed this and that.

It's ok if you're late.

I'll just wait for you at home.

Yes, I got it.

Ok.

Bye.

Oh yeah, Kwang Suh.

There's a friend at my place.

She's quite weird.

Hey... Hey...

Traffic accident.

The leg over there. And the arm here.

And the fracture on the shoulder. Be extra careful.

I know. Don't worry.

And from here on, it's better.

Natural death here.

Suicide here.

Ok.

If we get caught, you will lose your job.
And I'll be... Right?

I know. Don't worry.

It's not our first time.

Be careful then.

Yes.

How much money do you get per person?

Per body?

We don't call dead people people.
Per body.

So you've been washing them with that hand?

Come on...

It's normally not allowed.

The forensics must do it themselves.

I'm just doing it because of an
upper class man that I know. So you can't tell anyone.

That's illegal then!

So that!

How much do you get paid per body?

Why? You want to help me out?

Yes! I'll lend you money.

Did she make all of these?

Look at the fruits! (expensive in Korea)

They sent all this from Dae Gu?

I don't think it has to do with you.

You're so mean.

I live with Eun Bi under the same roof.

Aren't you her friend?

We're practically a family here!

Umm...

I'll just wait here until Eun Bi gets back.

Come on.

What's the rush?

You're quite good looking.

Name?

Kwang Suh. Hyun Kwang Suh.

Kwang Suh.

It's all about making a living.

It's not like it's hospital bill for someone dying.

It's just about means to get through.

I have a fully able body.
If I have to borrow money

Just for means to get through,
that's just being lazy.

You talk so funny...

This is how my Grandma talks.

It's all right, and it's all good.

But you don't have time.

If you want to get better before the competition,

I'll make sure that I won't miss practice.

-Is it ego?
-It could be that too.

That tastes so good.
She is so good at cooking.

There are so many kinds of food.

I can smell her family cooking already.

It's so good.
How often does she send these?

I hope she sends them often.

Among the following which one shows the...

I'll help Aunt cleaning up. You guys talk.

You don't need to help.

You're not married yet.

We have plenty of people here.

Yes. It's been a while seeing you.
Just stay here.

Yes sir.

I heard that you cooked that shrimp today!

That was really good.

Jin! The best thing you did in your life
was getting Ra Kyung.

I'm the one who's lucky here.

Don't be like that.

Everyone knows that here already.

It's a marriage that your family has a lot to lose.

Aren't you going to set up the wedding date?

We're not anxious yet.

In Jin's position, it is something to be anxious about.

He is not making any contributions to the family.

Shouldn't he at least settle to make his
in-laws happy?

Exactly.

There are good news about him wrapping up
well on the fund conference.

My Father was especially happy.

Your Father is so generous.

You should have attended the conference at least.

Because I had to talk in your position,
it sounded like I was making excuses.

You should have stood up yourself and made
statements about your investments.

You're the one who boasted and took the project.

Had I finished the project, it wouldn't have been
that bad you know.

By the way,

is it alright for you to not work like this?

Huh?

If you're staying out of the business,
Father won't be too happy.

Father and company?

If you say that you're just going to paint,
because you've been married to me.

Father will hate his daughter-in-law.

He may even hate our child later.

He won't.

It's alright.

That's good then.

Our child.

I'm really scared of Uncle.

I think he's being too harsh on you.

That's because my father always beat him.
And Grandpa never acknowledged him.

Grandpa always put the younger son, my father,
on top of Uncle.

Then one day, that mighty younger brother,

disappeared all of the sudden. Throwing everything away.

Because he wanted to paint.

But that's all in the past.

I'm really ok.

It's not like it happened once.

But still! Aren't you angry?

You've cleaned up the mess
your cousin made so well.

He's not even thankful.

Go in. You did a good job.

Tomorrow is the competition right?

See you tomorrow.

Don't get anxious!

You know what I mean right?

You know...
Don't think of it as an audition.

Practice like it's real. And do the real like what?

-Practice.
-Right like practice. Easy does it.

What's more important?

Don't get anxious! Don't be anxious and take it down.

You can do it! You can!

You're the one who's anxious here.

By the way...
Isn't Hong Jae Yi coming?

Shouldn't he play the song himself?

-Hey!
-You scared me!

Didn't I say not to mention Hong Jae Yi?

What are you going to do if others hear it?

His only condition was that his name
won't be put up on the work!

That was his only condition!

As soon as people find out that Hong Jae Yi
did our songs, he will leave.

Do you understand?

Don't ever talk about his name again.

OK.

For one to be this dumb,
it's not called sympathy. But hard beating.

You...

No, no, no.

The important thing here is that.

Oh yeah, Eun Bi.

Our lead actress.

Don't feel burdened.

You're doing half of it.

You know what I mean right?

Just do as you normally do it.

You know... Just do it as usual.

I'll take care of him.

You guys practice.

Don't let him come back today.

Ok get together.

Yes, teacher.

Next next!

It's alright.

No, I'm alright.

You're almost here right?

Even if I don't do well, the piece is great.

Yes.

OK, sure.

My friend.

He met a person.

<i>~Until now, he is still in my heart.~</i>

<i>~One letter from your name. One letter from mine.
That's how we were going to name our...~</i>

<i>~Singing, singing, sing with me.
In the morning...~</i>

<i>~Please remember me.~</i>

<i>~That's when the music comes out.~</i>

<i>~Song in the morning.~</i>

<i>~Song in the morning.~</i>

How do you like it Representative Yu?

Listening to one piece and the story
won't make it sound as good as the full musical.

I already like 2 pieces.

If it can impress Yu Jin in 15 minutes,
that's already global standards.

That won't be so easy.

How can you be full with just a shot?

Ok. next!

Hello!

Hello!

She's the co-actress next to the lead actress.

It's called "Dog Tail"

It's all a funny character.

Sister.

One, Two, Three, thank you.

Like it says on the synopsis.

The lead actress feels love from the lead actor
the first time.

She is trembling.

Let's begin.

<i>~For all those times.~</i>

<i>~Until I got here...~</i>

<i>~Through milleniums...~</i>

<i>~I still live here.~</i>

<i>~All the time, that I have endured.~</i>

<i>~It was all for this one person.~</i>

<i>~I always told myself to not fall in love.~</i>

<i>~I couldn't love anyone.~</i>

<i>~But ever since I saw you for the first time.~</i>

<i>~The time stopped. And the love grows.~</i>

<i>~Long lonely love compared to the millenium.~</i>

<i>~My footsteps towards you!
My heart is to you!~</i>

<i>~No matter how hard I try to look away.~</i>

<i>~There's only one thing that I want.~</i>

<i>~I can't stop right here.~</i>

<i>~My love...~</i>

<i>~Or you... I'll tell everything today.~</i>

<i>~I'll say it with my one last breath.~</i>

<i>~You are my only love.~</i>

Only two?

We have two more.
But the writer wants to edit them some more.

Who's the song writer?

It doesn't say here.

The writer... actually...

Hey!

The role is Doha. What's your name?

It's Go Eun Bi.

The song is very good.

But isn't the key too low?

It's the lead actress song.
But it sounds like a guy's song.

Can we take it up some keys?

But, the music isn't ready...

Eun Young. Take it up half a note.

Take another key higher?

That's good.

<i>~The only thing that I want is!~</i>

Like this.

I don't think that will match Go Eun Bi's.

We can always edit the song later.

Really?

But if a girl wants to do musical.

Shouldn't she be able to sing this much at least?

Can I have a try?

No. I want to listen to it with Go Eun Bi's voice.

Yes ma'am. I'll try that.

<i>~The only thing that I want is!~</i>

<i>~But I can't stop.~</i>

<i>~My love...~</i>

<i>~I'll be honest with all of my feelings today.~</i>

<i>~I will say it with my one last breath.~</i>

<i>~You're my only love.~</i>

Enough.

That's good enough.

The song is really good. The singing is...

I can't bear it.

I'm sorry.

It's ok. We're not auditioning for actress here.

Is it that the company is that poor to have
an actress who's not ready to come up?

Or were you taking this lightly?

It's not like that.

The key was set for her.

So if you get sponsored here,
will you have her as the lead actress?

We only need to talk about the piece here.

First...
Musical pieces...

are things that need lots of hands
in order to have their lives prolonged.

We can't be sponsoring on a song like this,
that's been written to suit one person.

No matter how good the piece is,
if it's like this...

Wouldn't there be problems with sponsoring?

It's not that.

Yes it's me.
I was the one who lowered the keys.

Other actresses can sing it with high tones.

It's not high.
It's normal.

Yes. It's normal.

I can't take it anymore.

Seriously. You don't even have the basics.
How dare you to...

If you don't have talent, you should give up.

Aren't you ashamed?

I'm sorry.

You've given me the opportunity.
I'm not ashamed.

-I am sorry.
-It's fine.

The professionals hate the word "sorry."

Be responsible and quit.

Having not enough talent is enough.
Don't ask for forgiveness. I hate such rudeness.

Kang Hee!

Let's take a 10 minute break.

Kang Hee.

Is something wrong?

I want to see Bae Kang Hee for a sec.

What she said as a judge...

It's not because of that.

I...

I wanted to get her autograph.

What's going on?

Excuse me...

This is embarrassing.

Let's go already.

We should wait for Eun Bi!

We just went through an embarassment all because of her.

Let's just go.

How come you become such a pain when
Hong Jae Yi isn't around?

Forget it.
Let's just go to a cafe or something.

Let's go to a cafe.
Text Eun Bi to come.

Is it that you have guts?
Or that you have no shame?

Or are you stupid?
Or are you really smart?

And are you inferring that I'm ok no matter
what kinds of insults you throw at me?

It's not that.

When this book first came out,
I stood in line to buy this.

I read it more than my textbook.

I read it with more attention.

The reason I dreamed about musicals.

And the reason that kept me going was all
this book right here.

When I saw you...
I wanted to get an autograph.

I just wanted to make a good impression.

Although it was quite heartbreaking today,
it's become really hard to see you again.

But next time,

I'll practice even harder and be here.

That's really touching.

I'll be cheering for you.

Thank you!

-Why did you?
-Let's start again.

How many do we have left?

So, by how much did she raise the key?

What about Eun Bi?

I see. I'll see you at the office.

<i>The number you've dialed...</i>

<i>Please leave a message.</i>

Go Eun Bi.
You're not someone who can't sing.

You're definitely not someone not qualified
for doing musicals.

And also.

About how you stood until the end.

Thank you!

Are you alright?

I am alright, thank you.

Did something happen during the competition?

No.

I sang really happily.

In front of the person that I respect the most.

I sang the song I really liked.

Thank you!

Are you going to watch the whole thing?

I didn't edit. It's really long.

No. I just need to watch one of them.
It should be the 7th.

The title is... "Chung Dam Dong's Nine Tails. "

It's the one they did when I was out.

Kang Hee had a strange reaction to it.

-Who says that?
-Director Cha who shot the film.

Although Kang Hee isn't the nicest person,
he said that she was especially hard on them.

What did you make with for this?

Something there.

You should have just asked me to do it.

You said that guys who can't cook
are not even guys.

Who says that?

-Her!
-Shh!

<i>A piece like this,
can be put on a big stage on a bigger scale.</i>

You don't want to sponsor them, but
make a full production investment?

That's right.
The content is interesting.

Music is even better.

And in my opinion, this "Chung Dam Dong Nine Tails"
has a very good Asian taste to it.

It can be even be exported worldwide.

Let's make a piece that will earn us the money.

If it can happen.
What could I possibly ask for?

But...
The reason they hid the writer --

We should check if there are problems.

We will have to see if it's original.

There are no other problems except you.

What?

Us buying the song and producing it.
There are no problems.

I'm just not sure if you will continue liking the piece,
after you've found out who wrote the songs.

Who's the writer that's impressed you so much?

Is this Representative Gu Jak?
This is Yu Jin from Amour Fund.

Yes I saw you at the competition.

Don't worry about me.
What she said was all true.

It is wrong.
I didn't write the song just for anyone.

I won't edit it to suit others' voices either.

It's not like that.

It's a good piece.
Make it suitable for a lot of people.

Lots of people watching it. Isn't that great?

This is a song that suited Go Eun Bi!

Geez!

Anyway the objective was,
to get this piece sponsored.

As long as we accomplish that.

And as long as I get better like it's been scheduled.

Doha in "Chung Dang Dong Nine Tails."

What?

It's me. Is it out already?

What?

He wants to go big scale from the start.

You know?

The Jin Dynasty background.
And the Roman Empire background.

What lines do we need? We just need to put
it up on the stage!

They don't want to sponsor it. But
they want to produce it themselves?

Yes! Co-producing.

-Forget it.
-Jae Yi.

I'm really sorry to break your dreams.
You know Yu Jin?

If he finds out that I'm the one who wrote the song -

He does.

He already knew.

So his condition was that you write all of the songs.

Jae Yi.

To me this is like,
jackpot in a lottery.

It's like getting the apartment.

It's like Jeon Ji Hyun falling for me on a blind date.
And her wanting to be in my shows.

It's like all of these happening at once.

They want to put in 4 million for my music.

<i>~I will say all of the things honestly today.~</i>

<i>~My last...~</i>

<i>~My last...~</i>

<i>~My last breath will tell it.~</i>

<i>~He is my only love.~</i>

That's good.

This song is yours.

Should I make it so that only you can sing it?
