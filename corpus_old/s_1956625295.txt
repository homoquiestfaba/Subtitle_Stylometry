As a police officer, we base our
careers off of factual evidence.

[ indistinct whispering ]

It was just a typical shift,

Looking forward
to a boring night.

â™ªâ™ª

What made me want to be
a police officer was...

My attraction to action.

â™ªâ™ª

I had to get out as fast
as I could.

â™ªâ™ª

I felt helpless.

â™ªâ™ª

Just couldn't believe
what I had seen.

â™ªâ™ª

It changes your opinion
on the supernatural.

[ siren wailing ]
you can't deal with something
that you have no idea about.

[ indistinct whispering ]

There was no police training
when it comes to this.

â™ªâ™ª

Aah!

â™ªâ™ª

By far, this is

One of the strangest experiences
of my life.

I can't put my finger on it
and say why,

But it happened.

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator:
The greater st. Louis area

Is more than a gateway
to the west.

It's home to over
3 million people,

And keeping them safe

Is officer sean haefeli.

I've been a police officer
for almost 20 years now.

I am the only person
in my entire family

That's a police officer.

It was a calling.

Man: Will you have the alarm
company respond, please?

Haefeli: Being a police officer,
most of us,

I would say, are less likely
to believe in things

That are unexplained --
the supernatural.

This is something that is not
talked about a lot.

[ police radio chatter ]

This is taboo.

â™ªâ™ª

Woman: 10-4.

â™ªâ™ª

[ telephone rings ]

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: This old home
on the edge of town

Has been quieter than usual.

An elderly woman lives here

With three of her
adult grandchildren,

But no one has seen
any of them for almost a week.

â™ªâ™ª

Officer haefeli is sent
to investigate.

Haefeli: We handle quite often
the welfare calls,

Which is what this was.

On November 26, 2006--

This was a Sunday
just after thanksgiving --

This family was concerned
because they hadn't seen

Or spoke to their relatives
in several days,

And they were concerned
for their safety.

I asked my partner

To respond to the house with me.

â™ªâ™ª

St. Louis police!

â™ªâ™ª

I'm gonna head around back.

It was important to try
to get into the house,

Because if somebody
was needing assistance,

We would be able
to offer that to them

As quickly as possible.

Nothing had sparked my suspicion
that something was not right.

â™ªâ™ª

Yeah, we're all clear.

[ gunshots ]

â™ªâ™ª

I suddenly felt myself
getting peppered with bullets.

I could feel the bullets
going in me.

[ groaning ]

No!

[ groaning continues ]

Officer down!
Officer down!

I'm trying to stay conscious.

I'm trying to stay alert.

I'm doing everything I can

To keep going
and to keep fighting.

Hang in there. Hang in there.
Hang in there. Ooh.

[ screaming ]

Come on, man.
Here we go.

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Officer haefeli
is rushed to the hospital

With multiple bullet wounds.

â™ªâ™ª

Back at the home,

Police have a 5-hour standoff
with the assailant...

[ police radio chatter ]

...Whose identity
remains unknown.

[ shouts indistinctly ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ echoing ] put your hands up!
[ gunshot ]

He was armed with a rifle
and a handgun.

A sniper wind up shooting him.

Narrator: The shooter,
who dies at the scene,

Is identified
as michael inman,

A former marine and
the missing woman's grandson.

At that time,
there was still the unknown.

There was three people missing

From the house at that point.

Police had been there
for several days

Processing the crime scene.

I found out later
that the bodies

Were discovered
in the basement...

â™ªâ™ª

...In a closet.

â™ªâ™ª

He murdered his family.

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Michael inman
killed his grandmother

And his two sisters.

I mean, he was normal
at one point.

He was a marine.
He protected our country.

I don't know what made him snap.

Maybe he was going through ptsd.

Maybe he heard voices.

Maybe they said
something to him,

Telling him to do something.

[ indistinct whispering ]

Aaaaah!

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: The victims
and the gunman are buried.

The home is abandoned,

And all the power
and telephone lines are cut.

â™ªâ™ª

Although officer haefeli was hit
by four bullets,

None of them proved fatal.

I definitely consider myself
very lucky to be alive.

I was off work for four
to five months.

When I came back to work,
this is when it all started.

â™ªâ™ª

[ telephone rings ]

[ echoing and whispering ]
he's got a gun.

Somebody has --

Somebody's got a gun.

[ dial tone ]

When I came back to work,
the house called 911.

There was between
5 and 10 calls.

How is that even possible?

How does a house that has no
power, no phone,

No gas running to it --
how was there 911 calls?

So, I did look it up
in the computer,

And I did see that
there were 911 calls

That were coming
from the house.

However,
nobody could explain why.

â™ªâ™ª

I felt compelled to go there.

I felt like the house
was calling me.

[ police radio chatter ]

â™ªâ™ª

I work night shift.

I was in full uniform
in a marked police car,

And all I had
was my flashlight with me.

I got out of the car.
I stood in front of the house.

â™ªâ™ª

I notice that there was four
crosses put up

In front of the house --

Three of them for the victims...

[ women screaming, gunshot ]

...And one of them for him.

Man: Aaaaaah!

â™ªâ™ª

So, I-I started moving forward.

It was dark.
It was chilly outside.

And, to be honest with you,
it looked like the house

Out of
"nightmare on elm street."

It was very creepy.

â™ªâ™ª

[ wind chimes tinkling ]

I had this, uh,
overwhelming feeling

Like I was not alone.

â™ªâ™ª

[ indistinct whispering ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ whispering continues ]

â™ªâ™ª

I went towards the back
of the house.

[ whispering continues ]

I started becoming overwhelmed
with feelings

As I got to the backyard.

I can't really put my finger
on it, how it felt.

It just felt surreal.

â™ªâ™ª

Man: [ echoing ]
officer down!

[ groaning ]

Send backup!

â™ªâ™ª

I stood there for a moment,

And I had to build up
the courage to go in.

â™ªâ™ª

I took a gigantic,
very deep breath,

And I held it for a second...

And I made entry into the house
through the back door.

â™ªâ™ª

I didn't know what to expect.

I didn't know what was
going to happen.

â™ªâ™ª

[ indistinct whispering ]

There was no police training
when it comes to this.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ indistinct whispering ]

[ dial tone ]

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Three people were
murdered inside this house

Just outside st. Louis.

â™ªâ™ª

[ woman screams ]

[ gunshot ]

And officer haefeli almost lost
his own life here.

[ gunshots ]

Man: [ echoing ]
officer down!

Shots fired!

Send backup!

Now he's back investigating
a series of 911 calls

Made from the abandoned home...

Even though the phone lines
have been cut.

The house was calling me.

It's impossible.
It can't happen.

I'm a police officer.
I want to know facts.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Woman:
[ echoing and whispering ]
he's got the gun?

Woman #2: [ echoing
and whispering ] yes.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

I could only imagine...

[ gunshot ]

...What was going
through their minds

When this was happening
to them.

They were completely helpless.

To be brutally murdered
like that is just beyond me.

â™ªâ™ª

It was my responsibility
to protect the people

In my community.

â™ªâ™ª

[ indistinct whispering ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ whispering continues ]

â™ªâ™ª

Hello?

â™ªâ™ª

[ heart beating ]

[ indistinct whispering ]

â™ªâ™ª

My heart was racing.

â™ªâ™ª

I- I felt that feeling
of wanting to get out.

â™ªâ™ª

But I knew I needed
to push it aside.

â™ªâ™ª

So I made my way
down the stairs,

And that musty basement smell

Was heavy.

â™ªâ™ª

When I reached the bottom
of the steps,

I could see the dust
that had been accumulating

Over the time that
the house was not maintained.

â™ªâ™ª

[ rustling ]

â™ªâ™ª

And that's when I-I saw
the ouija board.

â™ªâ™ª

As I shined my light down
towards it and got closer to it,

I noticed the marker
was on the letter "u,"

And it was pointing towards me.

My feeling at the time
was disbelief.

I couldn't believe
that this was happening.

â™ªâ™ª

[ indistinct whispering ]

[ thumping ]

[ water running ]

I felt that the people

That were brutally murdered...

â™ªâ™ª

...Wanted to see me.

â™ªâ™ª

[ indistinct whispering ]

The bodies were discovered
in that closet.

I could feel my adrenaline
immediately spike.

â™ªâ™ª

I felt constricted.

I felt like I couldn't breathe
very well.

â™ªâ™ª

It was an overwhelming
feeling to run,

But I knew I needed
to push through that.

I needed to see
inside that closet.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Haefeli: This family
was brutally murdered...

[ gunshot ]

...And shoved into a closet
in a basement.

It felt like
they were calling me.

[ telephone rings ]

[ indistinct whispering ]

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Officer haefeli
of the st. Louis police

Has been drawn back

To the scene
of a horrific triple murder.

I knew I needed to see
inside that closet.

â™ªâ™ª

In my brain,

Everything is slowed down

So I can replay it over
and over in my head.

[ woman vocalizing ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ indistinct whispering ]

There was a cool breeze
that ran right through me.

It went right through my body,

And it immediately made
the hair on my neck

And my arms
and my legs stand up.

â™ªâ™ª

You could say it was spirits.

You could say it was the family
that had been murdered.

They overtook my body.

I remember apologizing
to them...

That I wasn't there for them

When this happened.

Anything else,
I- I-I don't recall what I said.

It was how I felt at the time

And what I wanted to say
to get off my chest at the time

So I would have peace
and so would they.

â™ªâ™ª

I felt relief.

But then I felt...

Something else.

[ women screaming, gunshots ]

I felt like he was there, too.

â™ªâ™ª

It was not peaceful anymore.
It was not comforting anymore.

[ woman screams ]

[ indistinct whispering ]

Something bad was going
to happen to me if I stayed.

[ whispering continues ]

I knew I had to get out
as fast as I could.

[ echoing moaning
and screaming ]

And I ran.

[ screaming continues ]

I ran up the stairs.

â™ªâ™ª

I ran out...

The back of the house.

[ breathing heavily ]

I'm telling you what --
as soon as I got outside,

I felt relief.

I could breathe again.

[ breathing heavily ]

â™ªâ™ª

When you think back and of all
the other stories

You've heard in the past,

And you just kind of
discounted them

Because...

They were stories, you know,

There was no factual
basis to it all.

â™ªâ™ª

But when it happens to you,

It changes your opinion on...

The supernatural.

â™ªâ™ª

After I left the house,
the 911 calls stopped.

To my knowledge,
there was never any more.

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Several years after
the murders, the house is sold.

Within weeks of moving in,

The new owner begins
to hear voices.

He moves out shortly afterwards.

[ indistinct whispering ]

â™ªâ™ª

I mean, who's gonna believe us?

I still don't talk to people
about it.

This is the first time
in maybe 20 years.

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator:
Tillamook bay

Is a quiet inlet
on the oregon coast.

â™ªâ™ª

It's not a hotbed for crime,

But that doesn't
necessarily mean it's safe.

â™ªâ™ª

Poling: All up and down
the oregon coast,

You'll hear these tales

About haunted lighthouses
and so forth,

But a lot of us police officers,
we just --

You know, it just rolls
right off the top of our heads.

We're trained to only accept
half of what we hear

And to believe most
of what we see,

So skepticism fits right in
to the scheme of things,

Or at least our standard
operating procedure.

Narrator:
Officer phil poling

Has been patrolling the bay area
for eight years.

â™ªâ™ª

When this happened,
I was working the street,

I was a patrol sergeant
at the time.

â™ªâ™ª

It was just a typical shift.

â™ªâ™ª

Looking forward
to a boring night,

4:00 p.M. To midnight.

I know there was
not gonna be anything going on.

It wasn't even the weekend.

[ police radio chatter ]

â™ªâ™ª

So, I was patrolling
the north area, and I figured,

"well, since there's nothing
going on here,

I'll go do
some security checks."

And that's when I went down
to the warehouses.

â™ªâ™ª

I decided to spotlight some of
the buildings and check them out

And make sure everything's okay.

â™ªâ™ª

It was, like, dead quiet.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

All of a sudden,
there's this color or something

Reflecting off
some windows or --

I wasn't sure what it was.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Then I saw something again.

I knew there was
something else here.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

And then...

I saw something

Reflecting on the windshield.

[ electricity crackling ]

â™ªâ™ª

And what I saw was all these
different colors --

Red, green, orange, blue.

It was just -- it was nuts.

It just kept going.

â™ªâ™ª

I know it wasn't a helicopter.

I know what the lights
on a helicopter look like.

It was kind of a strobe, then
you'd see one flash on and off,

Then you'd see one cross over
another like maybe a spotlight.

â™ªâ™ª

I felt helplessness, you know,
and the shock of the moment,

That numbness...

And the awe.

â™ªâ™ª

But then I started getting
a little, um...

Nervous.

And I'm looking around.
There's nobody there.

I'm it.

I'm like the frontline.

â™ªâ™ª

It was a ufo.

What else could it have been?

I'm thinking to myself,
"here they come."

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Officer poling

Thought he was going to have
a quiet night

Patrolling tillamook bay,
oregon...

â™ªâ™ª

Until he encounters an unknown
light source in the sky.

[ electricity crackling ]

Poling: So, there I was,
standing out there,

Wondering what the hell
was about to happen.

And all kinds of things races
through your mind at the time

And all feelings
were coming across, you know,

And, of course,
that feeling of helplessness.

There's nothing worse
in a police officer's career

Than to feel helpless.

â™ªâ™ª

[ electricity crackling ]

â™ªâ™ª

And then these lights went away

As quickly as they came.

â™ªâ™ª

And I was just standing there,

Wondering if this was some
precursor to something

That was about to happen

That I was not prepared for.

â™ªâ™ª

And I was gonna go tell dispatch
and find out

If there was any reports
of anything strange,

But then I thought,

"you don't want people
to think you're nuts,"

Especially when you're wearing
a badge.

It just doesn't go hand-in-hand.

I didn't want to talk to anybody
about it, especially dispatch.

I mean,
who's gonna believe this?

I wouldn't.

I still don't talk to people
about it.

This is the first time
in maybe 20 years.

Man: Officer poling,
what's your 20?

And that's when I got a call
from dispatch.

â™ªâ™ª

Yeah, I'm at the wharf.
Go ahead.

Got some 911 calls
coming in

About something going on
over the bay.

Yeah, I'm on my way.

10-4.

[ siren wails ]

All the action was happening
over the bay.

[ wailing continues ]

[ wailing continues ]

There were 911 phone calls

About a ufo
hovering over the bay.

â™ªâ™ª

We get training in the
beginning of our careers --

We have academy,
we have in-service training,

Plus all the experience
you get on the road --

But this was a completely
different animal.

[ wailing continues ]

â™ªâ™ª

[ engine revs ]

[ wailing continues ]

I drove to the end of the line.

â™ªâ™ª

It just submerged
right underneath the water.

â™ªâ™ª

I was looking out at the bay.

â™ªâ™ª

I turned on my dash cam,
pointed it out towards the bay,

Just waiting for this
whatever it is to come back up,

Because I wanted it on film.

â™ªâ™ª

It was calm, quiet,

No animals.

I didn't even hear any seagulls
that night,

Which I thought
was kind of odd

'cause normally
you would hear them

Flying along the shoreline,
squawking.

Heard nothing.

â™ªâ™ª

That bay is only like
8, 9 feet deep,

Very shallow,

Mud bottom, no caves,

So I don't know why anything
would be going down there.

â™ªâ™ª

I felt very inept.

I mean,
police officer or not,

You can't deal with something
that you have no idea about.

No ufo class in police academy.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

You know that anticipation
of what's about to happen

And that electric feeling,
that rush that comes over you,

The chill that runs up
your back?

Well, that's the way it was.

That's -- that's the way
it was at the time.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

So, I was basically looking
at my last hour of shift,

Looking out at the bay,

But I saw nothing at all.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

So, there I was,
the end of shift, finally,

And, uh, I just logged it
in my patrol log,

Report of the ufo.

Didn't put much as far
as my own observations

'cause I felt it was
kind of pointless.

My dash cam recorded nothing
but calm water.

But I did tell my wife.

I went home and I spoke with her
about it,

And she grinned and she says,
"okay, honey, whatever."

â™ªâ™ª

Maybe it's still down there.

â™ªâ™ª

You can't help but wonder.

â™ªâ™ª

I knew what I had seen,

But I didn't know
what to say or who to tell.

I got the chills running up my
back right now, honest to god.

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Indian island
is a tiny community in maine

Floating
in the penobscot river.

Only a few people
call this land home.

[ police radio chatter ]

Not many officers want
to work the night shift,

But for a young rookie
like jamie dube,

Any assignment
is a good one.

Dube: What made me want to be
a police officer

Was my attraction to action.

I always wanted to be part
of what was going on.

â™ªâ™ª

But tonight, this young officer
is about to learn

You should be careful
what you wish for.

I'm not sure
why this happened to me...

â™ªâ™ª

...But I was afraid.

I was in shock.

Just couldn't believe
what I had seen.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Jamie dube
is a rookie officer

Patrolling the sparsely
populated community

Of indian island, maine.

Man: I'm about one out,
if you want to stand by there,
and I'll take over.

Dube:
Indian island, you know,

There's a lot of stories
over there -- ghost stories --

And I was always kind of afraid
of what I would see, kind of,

Just because, you know,
it's a native american island,

Lots of spiritual things
over there,

So I was always uneasy.

â™ªâ™ª

[ police radio chatter ]

Dispatch, this is dube.

Be advised conditions
are getting a lot worse

On hiawatha road.
Over.

Man: Copy that.
What's your 20?

I remember it was really,
really, really foggy --

Superfoggy.

It was almost like you could
take a knife

And kind of cut
through the fog.

And it was a still night --
very, very still.

I'm just gonna do one more pass
around the pond,

And then I'll be
back at base. Over.

I was a fairly new officer
when this happened,

And I think I had been
on the force

About six months at the time.

My role on the island
at the time of the incident,

It was mostly patrol.

Doing midnight shifts
was mostly what I did.

â™ªâ™ª

Patrolling midnights
were always a little, uh, eerie.

I would always patrol
the cemetery to see

If anyone's in there
that shouldn't be in there,

'cause after dark, you know,

You're not supposed to be
in the cemetery.

â™ªâ™ª

I never liked that part
of our job,

But, as a police officer,
you don't have that choice.

â™ªâ™ª

I was on the backside
of the pond.

I was driving up a hill.

There was no wind,

And it was just heavy.

It was a very,
very heavy night.

It was just one of those
thick, thick nights.

I was looking into the blackness
of 3:00 in the morning...

â™ªâ™ª

...And then
I kind of see something.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Dispatch, this is dube.

There's something
happening out here.

Copy, dube.
Do you need assistance?

â™ªâ™ª

Dube?
I'm just gonna check it out.

Over.

That's a copy.

I immediately get out
of the car.

â™ªâ™ª

And it's a very, very,
very old cemetery.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

But I'm not sure if my eyes
were playing tricks on me

Because of the fog.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ echoing ]
is there anybody out here?

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Hey!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

Narrator: Officer jamie dube

Is patrolling
near the old cemetery

On indian island, maine,

Just as he has every night

Since joining the force.

But tonight...

Something feels very different.

â™ªâ™ª

[ echoing ]
is there anybody out here?!

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

And then I see this woman

Coming up from the pond.

She was all in white.

â™ªâ™ª

Everything was white.

I kind of see her right now
as I'm telling the story.

So, I radio dispatch.

â™ªâ™ª

You know, what am I
looking at here?

I really wasn't sure.

Dispatch, this is dube.

There is what appears to be
a woman in the water.

And I said, you know,

"I'm gonna be off
on this call down by pond.

There's a lady coming up
from the pond.

She's by herself.

I'll let you know
what's going on here."

â™ªâ™ª

When I first saw her,
I honestly believed

It was a woman
that needed my help.

â™ªâ™ª

Hey, miss?!

â™ªâ™ª

You know, you really shouldn't
be out here this late!

And I'm getting closer
and closer and closer,

And I'm noticing
she wasn't wet at all.

Didn't look like she had come
out of the water or anything,

Because her clothes were dry.

â™ªâ™ª

And her face was blurred.

I could see the full body,

And it wasn't transparent,

But I couldn't see the face.

â™ªâ™ª

And I thought, you know,
"what am I looking at here?"

I really wasn't sure.

â™ªâ™ª

I knew I was looking at someone,

But, at the same time,

I had an eerie feeling

That something was wrong.

You know, am I looking
at a lady,

Or am I looking at a ghost?

â™ªâ™ª

Too close for my comfort.

â™ªâ™ª

Aah!

[ breathing heavily ]

She was gone.

It -- it was that quick.

I was looking at her,

But she just vanished on me,

And so, at that point,

I knew I'd seen a ghost, spirit,

Whatever you want to call them.

[ breathing heavily ]

â™ªâ™ª

I just couldn't believe
what I had seen.

And I looked all around.
There was nobody there.

[ breathing heavily ]

â™ªâ™ª

I mean, I got the chills
running up my back right now.

Honest to god, the hair's going
up the back of neck right now.

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

I knew what I had seen,

But I didn't know
what to say or who to tell.

And I went into dispatch,
and I sat down.

And he -- you know,
he had asked me, you know,

"who was out there
by the pond?"

I was almost embarrassed
to tell him what I had seen,

'cause, as a police officer,
you have to maintain

A certain
amount of credibility,

But I trusted
the dispatcher enough

To tell him what I had seen.

And I said it was a lady,

And she was dressed
all in white.

And I thought he was gonna look
at me and say, you know,

"what's wrong with you?"

Then he says,
"you saw the white lady."

And I said, "what do you mean,
the white lady?"

He was like, "well, you saw her.

Many people see her
around here."

I did find out there was
an old house down by the pond,

But it was torn down.

Some people had told me
that it was her house.

I never did find out
who she was.

I'm not sure why she revealed
herself to me

And then vanished.

I believe this incident
changed me as a person

And a police officer
in many different ways.

It just strengthens how I feel
about the paranormal,

And it made it
more real to me.

And once you see something
like this,

You can never not think
about it,

Especially, you know,
when it's foggy out.

After that,

I would go there many times,
many nights,

To see if I could see her again.

â™ªâ™ª

But it never happened.

Never happened.
