Murders not decided in Juarez.

El Pace, Tejas and Juarez, Mexicoâ€¦

Expressing its indignation.
Since 1993, more than 300 womenâ€¦

â€¦ she has lost the life. They exist suspicion of more
disappearances in unknown paradeiros.

Each time more young women
they disappear, and others appearâ€¦

â€¦ assassinated, forcene, mutilated.
Its bodies simply playedâ€¦

â€¦ in the desert as garbage.

If to cross the border, the laws
that in they conduct them they do not function.

It is in the hour of the company that
they enrich with this situationâ€¦

â€¦ to answer therefore.

E still thus, to each day and each night
this continues to be a death field.

One has constructed shelters
for the securityâ€¦

â€¦ but this is not consolation stops
a woman in the roadâ€¦

â€¦ the stopping of autocarro e enters
the quarter delinquent where it lives.

Lesson number five.
It repeats after me.

Priest Herrera! I am Karina Danes,
of the Newsweek of Los Angeles.

ChÃ¡ves professor gave its name to me,
he said that perhaps he would help meâ€¦

...com some contacts and with its
point of view onâ€¦

â€¦ murders of the women this way.

We will have an interview with one
employee of the policy. We will speak later?

Perhaps it can go I obtain.
Not, she will not be a collective one of the press.

We will speak with the policy stops
to improve the identification ofâ€¦

â€¦ victims, to give the notification
to the relatives.

I will make barulhos little of what
a rat. I promise.

Well, nothing will not ruin.

As it answers to accusations
of that the policy has partâ€¦

in a silence conspiracy?

We have arrested several
policies, as I know that it knows.

To mention more conspiracy of
policy ignores the advancesâ€¦

â€¦ in this fight.

But for the public point of view,
it has 300 women deceased and nobodyâ€¦

It makes nothing. It can comment to this respect?

We are a small force of the policy
with an enormous work.

I can assure to it that each track,
each signal, is followed and investigatedâ€¦

. total. Perhaps not
so fast as we wanted.

Yes we have a delay,
a great delay. We are not FBI.

As it is possible that they do not exist
defendant. Because he is that he has not suspected?

Let us see of the following point of view.
More murders in New York and L.A exist.

â€¦ in one month of what the ones that happen
here in one year entire. E how muchâ€¦

â€¦ corruption policy in such a way has there as here.
They are shameful small elements despite.

That is a respect lack.

These women are deceased of equal form.
She does not have no representative.

Perhaps she can in following them
in the next meeting, srta. You injure.

Will invite it?

Moan to make to wait them.
How he is priest?

It cheers to see it again to me.
Mr. Patrone, does not need to give to me hand to it.

Excuse. I know it?
Not, but I know it.

He is who represents
owners of the plant. Not?

I am the representative of Relations
Public of a trust ofâ€¦

â€¦ North American plants
here. E you?

Karina Danes. Work stops
the Newsweek de Los Ãngeles

It arrived until here.

That vision gives the sequestrations to it
e murders of women in Juarez?

One is not about vision, senhorita Danes.
The problem is of securityâ€¦

It does not have nor ideia of as this functions here.
It explains me.

We have shelters for almost
all the small ones, the workers.

We take them and we bring them
in one autocarro of the company.

One Would have to give looked at.
It would please me.

It was therefore that I came.
It would like to show to me?

Unhappyly I am of exit nowâ€¦
I understand.

What!?
El Pace is one of the citiesâ€¦

â€¦ safer of America, but
here, where we are stoppedâ€¦

â€¦ its life is alone in its hands alone
for being here it are in the sun.

Since they had constructed its plants
in the North America, they would have thatâ€¦

â€¦ to make as the laws and rules
of security of the local work.

Minimum wages. Conditions of
work. Here they make what they want.

Already it arrives. We came
to bring a benefit Ã¡ economy.

They are not victims. It comes e
they find a life better.

Good afternoon, Priest.

It helps me!

For the lesser door I
I cannot cross the border.

It wants to see the English lessons
what I have made?

E I go to continue practicando.

Senhorita Danes?

Later this night I will visit
the mother of a victim.

She can follow me. I have
certainty that will be very discrete.

Debtor, Priest.

Mr. Martinez

So I am worried mine amorzinho.

They are as many perigos.

I do not want that you are worried.

Its name was Light.

You say Spaniard?

Its name was Light.

I go to speak in Englishâ€¦

Not even we know if it arrived
in the plant in the turn of the night.

Or perhaps they have said to it
to come back.

If only to arrive one minute been slow,
order-in in return for house.

Teem that to make all
the trip in returnâ€¦

Of night, alone.

We said the policy that
it had disappeared.

She never was outside.
They had askedâ€¦

â€¦ if it had fiancÃ©. If
she left to dance at night.

It works during the night.

They had askedâ€¦

If it used, provocative clothes.

They had made repulsive questions.

In this place they were atreveram
to make these repulsive questions.

Not even they had said me that
they had found its body.

My neighborâ€¦ it it
she saw in the television.

They had shown its body.

They had listened?

Yes. What it was?

Who gave permission to the Priest?
What you find?

Priest!
Jorge Herrera!

Gabriel Lauro, to its orders

We never had in
known?

I am new here.

I am part of the inquiry
of homicides.

Excellent! What we have?

A body, priest.

We wait that it is here.

It has blood!

E they?

They areâ€¦
Suspected?

They were walking close
of the stopping of autocarro.

E had bound when
they turn this.

They had bound of where?

Of telemÃ³vel of the young.

AcreditaS thatâ€¦

It does not have money for shoes.
But has for one telemÃ³vel?

I am reporter. I came with it.

I feel very.

They had informed to me. It had another murder?
We still do not know.

What it has? It has something?
They are official subjects of the policy.

If to give plus a step,
I will have that arresting.

This excrement that speaks
on the Mexican arrests?

It is not excrement.

What they teem?

Blood for all part.

I am in Chihuahua, Mexico.

To the south of JuÃ¡rez.

In a called place â€œLa Mazapoleaâ€.

I find thatâ€¦

What it is this?

Something that does not serve very,
what it seems.

You are of all a solitary wolf?

To some other customers mine
they please to them to festejar in groups. Sabe?

It pleases to them to pass putinha
of one for the other.

Not, not, I not.

Yes, yes.

This.

She is perfect. It finishes of
to arrive. Nobody knows it.

I have somebody that I want
that it knows.

ACCESS FOR EMERGENCIES

Isidro. They had brought a young woman!

She is a worker of the plants.

It said that they had attacked it

It does not know if she is Lisbeth?

Detective Lauro!

It finds that this can help?

It finds that this setting will help in something?

Setting? It is to play?
The decent citizens of Juarezâ€¦

â€¦ they are running away.

E for the criminals this
it is an open invitation.

For all the parts these reminders.
A memorial is not alone, detective.

It is a warning.

They go to continue to go stops
the work and will follow them, killing them.

Because nobody protects them.
Please, somebody helps me.

You are American, speaks.
Somebody took my Lisbeth.

Who?
I do not know.

One and another time e came back
it asked and it asked.

Nobody said me nothing. Not
it arrived in house in fourth.

I am to come here and not
they say nothing.

It swims!

She is its wife?

They know that it is? It is of the desert.
It makes two days that have it.

We are a small group of policy. To
times we delay to identify.

It is a bureaucratic problem.
It is not for badly.

It is little what we can
to make. But we will have some track.

At night they had found
a young of the plant.

It survived to the attack.
Somebody survived? Who is?

Three men had found it
walking in the desert.

And they had not been they?
Not, they had finished to leave the work.

They had brought it.

Yes, she is in the hospital
where I work.

You know its name?
Not.

It does not speak since that it arrived.
I can interview it?

Not yet. The doctor said
that still he is in shock.

How is it?

Who could have done something thus?

This has that to finish.
Yes, it must finish.

Srta. Danes, would have to go now.

Yes, only a moment.

Please.

What it is to make here?
For what! it is not in house?

Not, not, my Lisbeth is deceased.

I gave my card to it.

A card with mine
name and telephone.

Yes, I did not find
between its things.

It listens, brazen,
it worries me that you appear.

What!?

You have the certainty?

Mariela that pretty name!

Therefore Mariela says me.
Of where you are?

Its family must be very
worried I obtain.

I it vi priest.

The Virgin.

She left the blackout and the vi.

Teeny.

Very you were bothered.

It is truth.

You have that to believe me.

Listen to-in?
Yes. Who Was?

The driver of autocarro
that the Lisbeth left.

He was the last one that he saw it alive.

The policy already interrogated it, but
already the sufficients had tests.

Isidro poor person.

AcreditaS in the stigma signals?

The church recognizes them.
Isidro feels that it saw a miracle.

And what you find of this?
I believe that it is a miracle thatâ€¦

â€¦ it has survived to the attack.

It walked investigating it. He stows
very busy in the east of Los Angeles.

Many of the members of mine
congregation has family in Juarez.

And very they are worried.
You have a great family.

He is its brother. You and yours
brotherâ€¦ is something very serious.

Lode to explore
situation between my brother and I?

It is a very impressive dichotomy.
You are a man of God.

E your brother is an outlaw. Certain?

As much God as the Devil is
in my brother, srta. You injure.

But, it tries to be
Christian to its way.

He is this? Is alone a good article?

Not. The reason is not this.
And which is then?

Because she is that a woman
attractive as youâ€¦

â€¦ it comes the alone Juarez and if it puts
in danger, if it will not be for fame?

It is not for fame. Already I have this, priest.

I wrote an article on women
Chinese who were imported.

To work in the industry of the sex.

An informer informed to me
on a full container of people.

Young girls.

Wise person where she was and since when
they were there. But it was not saidâ€¦

â€¦ the policy immediately.

It wanted to congregate one equips to film
the arrival of the policy to you fall it.

With the notice of the 6 of the afternoon.

Sabe, was my plan.

But it did not function, wise person?

The policy arrived e late
the reporter had finished.

E when they had opened the container
they had 36 girls deceased.

Nobody blamed me.

Nobody blamed me because he was one
good article and I had discovered.

But a girl was
to look at me. Direct in my eyes.

She blinked and she died soon.

E knows what I was to make?

To take off a photo to it.

All these weeks in one
container, and when they had finally openedâ€¦

â€¦ the cursed door, what if
it sees is its image in a lens dying.

I made this. I said.

God pardons it.

I do not believe, priest.

It will pardon it of
any form.

Yes.

What it is this.

Hidromorfina.

The doctor said that he is alucinando.

It is not alucinando.

The doctor is not a believer.

These drugs are poisons.

I can help it?
They had given to it high?

I feel very.
The young woman who was here. Where she is?

Iâ€¦

Isidro, waits!

Aid! Aid!

It helps me! It helps me please.

Debtor.

She is the young woman who was attacked.

This was another person.
They had not attacked to it.

Nobody touched to it.
She is it, you were there!

She is it! What it makes here?

It would have to be in the hospital!
It has that to speak with the policy!

Not, the mothers of
missing people will take care of of it.

It will be the saved one here.

The saved one?
You are not worried about it.

I am worried!

You see this? You see?

You see? You see these men?

Defendant to brutalize, to violate e
to kill women. You recognize some?

Srta. Danes!
Priest Herrera!

Please.

Isidro, shows to the women daqui.
Perhaps they recognize some.

It would have to be in the hospital.

Sabe that he is abetter
of sequestration of a young?

You are not melodramÃ¡tica. It wanted to leave there.
What she is to happen here?

Mariela the virgin, was changedded
in a change symbol.

A misfortune to
murders, a miracle.

For the supposed stigmata?
It has that to speak with the policy.

Its vision does not remember excepto you are welcome.
The policy is very busyâ€¦

â€¦ and nor all are reliable.

Yes we can join the Virgin with others
organizations that demand changesâ€¦

The Virgin! Of what you are to speak?

Its church approves this?
That is the church!

Still you are here!

You must see this. You must speak on it.
I will say how many people will be able.

It now has as much blackness, as much fear.

But it, this young,
bravely it crossed the desert.

Alone. E what it saw?

It wanted to ask something to it. Because it is
what it was to the desert?

Something took it. It was alone
this what it said.

Something compelled it.

Clearly, that pods not to understand.

You are as all. You have
lost the contact with God.

Isidro. What it happened in the desert?

It was covered of a brightness.
A shining light beautiful e.

E when it showed the hands,
I saw that the bloodâ€¦

â€¦ fluÃ­a of the hands, but not
he felt pain. E soon it spoke.

It?

It said that it had much what to make.

E that when it came back
to see, it would say more.

More on which
it would be its mission.

Mission?
It in will help them.

They are many.

Why it divided them?
I do not know. Because they search them.

This will attract them for here. They will kill it.
It must abandon Juarez.

It is to become itself, srta. You injure?
I do not want that they kill it.

Clearly that not.
It Would have to lead immediately.

Where she is your family?

Pods not to be here, are not safe.
Pods to go for house?

I do not have house.
To be itself here, kill you.

You are to understand?

Its will becomes.

Pods to choose. It has an option.

You have that to go, we can help.
The priest Herrera. I will help.

We will make a plan, is well?

Why nobody was to see Mariela?
Who?

The young that survived to the attack.
It has name, is Mariela.

I wanted to speak with Mariela,
but he ran away from the hospitalâ€¦

â€¦ and nobody knows where is,
or of where it came.

I know where I am. I saw it at night.

It changedded itself
in one simbolo religious.

She is of the people. E survived.
It is natural that they adore it.

Why they do not want to go to see it?
Later.

Later?
Beyond everything what it happens in Juarezâ€¦

â€¦ an American couple lost
its son of 13 years.

I find that all are with fear,
because you are here?

Each dayâ€¦ each day we receive
new advice, suggestions.

Training, and tomorrow will have
another reporter, another one cureâ€¦

Another person of FBI to say
how much imcompetent peopleâ€¦

â€¦ and corrupt we are.

He had a time that in Juarez
he only had a handful of menâ€¦

...com knives. Vendiam
alcohol, tobacco, prostitutes.

But now they are dollar millionsâ€¦

â€¦ in drugs and human contraband.

It has machine guns, airplanes. E
drugs fall in the head of all.

But the American dollar
it continues to enter to mounts.

If it did not have much hand
of cheap Mexican workmanship, and drugsâ€¦

Perhaps Juarez would not be
a yard of games for assassins.

With it offers and demand.

If to allow, I want to dedicate me
a time for the disappeared young womanâ€¦

â€¦ and probably assassinated.

She is white.

American.

American!

She calls me later.
I cannot speak now.

I am very busy.

It must be good.

It says soon what you want.

Necessary to smoke.

It calls me therefore?

Nor that he was selling
in the streets.

It has that to be stealing.

What it is to happen with you
youngster?

What you are looking at, old?

He knows it?

He is in the tomb.

I want to speak with FÃ©lix Sabas.

One does not meet available.

Where I can find it?

In the hell.

What it happened with the young woman?

Of that young you are to speak?

Of the Virgin

It is a legend.

Igualzinho to chupacabras.

It was grasped by chupacabras?

This scoundrel, was absorbs it blood.

What planeias to make?

To review my night.

You would have to be in the chain.

To protect itself exactly of you.

This will not change nothing.

Calm amiguinho. It takes more well-taken care of.

What it is to happen
with these women in Juarez?

These poor women live one
needy life. Many hours workâ€¦

â€¦ in the plants under conditions
horrible. E soon has that to goâ€¦

â€¦ for house with the favour of God
without they violate them or they kill them.

The Legend of the Virgin of Juarez.
Special news article of Karina Danes.

They wait!
Leave-in. They do not touch to it.

Transmitting to the direct living creature of Los Angeles.

I want that they know that I fight in
name of the fight of the worldâ€¦

â€¦ against the violence and the fear.

E for more, peace and harmony.

And you?
Very well.

Very well, Iâ€¦

I do not understand. I do not understand. Tem

I provided so that they had it
taken off of Juarez for some safe place.

E now is here
with these people.

In a species of cruzade.

What you want?

Why it came?
Because I want to write on you.

I do not know nothing. I want that it says me.

It does not remember nothing before
to go for the desert?

Iâ€¦ rememberâ€¦

...com leaves it.

E now is here.
In this place withâ€¦

With these outlaws.
They are not outlaws.

What they are then?
For me? They are warlike.

Encrostados in a battle
daily for the survival.

They are good men!
What it goes to happen now?

Where this goes to stop?
My intentionâ€¦

â€¦ it is to call the attention for
women. For the victimsâ€¦

â€¦ of the violence in Juarez.

â€¦ and for the women of the entire world.

Eâ€¦ I want to save them.
This is the taskâ€¦

â€¦ that the Saint MÃ£e gave to me.
E I am made useâ€¦

â€¦ to arrive until the end.

Until the day that to die.

How you could make me this?

Apunhalou me for the coasts!

I was the person who sent the Juarez.
He does not matter, Eve, he is of Los Angeles.

I want this article, Karina.
And many other people also.

Karina.
I am proprietor of the legal rightsâ€¦

â€¦ then it would be happy in arguing
the version in English I obtain.

Perhaps I can have control
total in the final version.

They hear me please.

The moment arrived.

The change moment.

E that we go. ,

â€¦ until sairmos of our oppressors.

For that they abuse us.

Let us banish the evil.

In all its forms.

The moment is now.

The moment is nowâ€¦

To hangâ€¦

â€¦ to that they abuse.

That they restrain.

FÃ©lix Sabas? I am?

Sabe what it is to happen here?
Who are you?

Detective Lauro?
These photosâ€¦

â€¦ that they had stolen of my office.
They are circulating for there, wise people?

Well! The people must know
what must take care, do not find?

They are kills them.
Who?

They are suspected! You understand this?

Suspected. Some interim
they are not died.

They are not obligatorily
culprits you are welcome.

Why he has photos of prisoners?
I know what he made. I know where it is.

I do not know of what he is to speak.
They want it here stops to interrogateâ€¦

â€¦ on the murders.
FBI will be informed.

Well, well, that is what it is called
stranger, sharing fellowship.

Srta. Danes. Knows Patrick Nuncio?
Clearly. They want to sit down?

They desire something to drink?

We came to ask for aid to it. All
we are in agreement that the violenceâ€¦

â€¦ it does not serve for nothing.

This is something unanimous.
Sabe what it spreads, this woman?

Sabeâ€¦?
I do not find that it has as much to see.

It does not matter what it believes.
Which is its interest?

Businesses. All the negative advertising
it moves with the nerves of the ownersâ€¦

â€¦ of the plant. China becomes more
atractiva and I lose customers.

E you? I thought that you were
against the plants?

Good payment, better
work conditions.

I fight therefore. But not
I want to see unemployment collectiveâ€¦

â€¦ because the plants will emigrate
another market of cheap work.

The situation alone goes to get worse for
people who if had moved with its familiesâ€¦

â€¦ for Juarez to put
food in the table.

Aid-in?

On what it has thought?
A meeting.

You wantâ€¦?
I not. It.

It would listen to it.
To listen what!?

That I finished everything this. She seesâ€¦

We can help it. Not this
group of the east of Los Angeles.

E its family? The church?

We want that in it helps them
to improve the things in Juarezâ€¦

â€¦ and you and Patrick
they will be puted in charge to supervise everything.

Why you find that it will hear me?
It seems that it likes to speak I obtain.

I only can assume that
it will also hear it.

The wine of the sacrament does not please to it?

Karina, I notâ€¦ Not
wise person that you were here.

This is not it.
What!?

It is not more thus.

This is the vision of a boy.
FBI the search and the policy in Juarez.

They accuse with murder.
This is ridicule.

We have that to even think
where this will arrive, priest.

God only knows of this.

What he wants of me?

We have a responsibility.
With who?

With the innocents?

Gio you do not trust me.

Priest, please.

I will make what he will be able.

With license.

When this movement was
gaining a supportâ€¦

â€¦ the church made a declaration
contradicting the miracle ofâ€¦

â€¦ supposed Virgin of Juarez.

It was the party?

The person in question alone is
known as Marielaâ€¦

â€¦ she is to be on to several
murders in El Paso and Juarez.

I will bind later for you.

It is associated with a group
of L.A that make traffic of drugsâ€¦

â€¦ and illegal armaments.

I have two things stops
to offer to them, gentlemen.

Where he will be. E when he will be there.

OK. Where and when?

With Patrick Nuncio.
It promised to cooperate completely.

He will make this?

E will leave to place a microphone?

Gio.
Because you are to make this? We had a plan.

A plan? I do not have plan.
What we had incluÃ­a not to sit downâ€¦

â€¦ to speak with the enemy.

Patrick Nuncio is enemy?
He is to capitulate.

To play for its rules. To say that
we will speak and arrive at a commitment.

This does not function, does not have
felt. I do not trust it.

What it is to happen, Gio?
I want to make this our way.

You are to lose the faith?

Not, I find that not.

Unger.
Unger Patrone, please.

As you want.

I thought that it would have to know
that it has place in the meeting betweenâ€¦

â€¦ its virgenzinha and Patrick Nuncio.

Now?
In this instant.

I have good notice.
Which are?

I spoke with the bishop on its
girl. We argue its beatification.

What!?
This exactly.

To become the things well, everything will give resulted.
It will put it in the way fastest.

It waits. Of what you are to speak?

To be saint, it must
to be dead. Of what you are to speak?

You are welcome. It hears it.
Not! When you said this?

Not even I remember you.
It said that it would forget it.

We go to cross fingers e
to pray so that all skirt well.

I do not cross the fingers when I pray.
Well! Perfect.

Unit 4. Its position?
Covering the exit, exchange.

Position in land?

Well, this is an only chance,
I believe. I wait that allâ€¦

â€¦ let us can prevent much pain e
suffering for many people.

This is what I believe.

It forgives me, I am one
little nervous.

I know it of some part.

We lose contact of audio.
It does not have movement.

They wait.

Where it left this?

It is mine.

It frees me, please!

It frees me, please! It frees me!

It frees me, please, not. Not!

With these handsâ€¦

â€¦ blessed with
blood of Ours Sirâ€¦

â€¦ I wait to find my exit.

She was the Virgin Maria.

Its voiceâ€¦ obtained that I was.

E gave force to me.

When everything what I wantedâ€¦

â€¦ it was that the blackness
e painâ€¦ painâ€¦

if they were.

The voice of it. Soâ€¦

So beautiful. E soonâ€¦

it appeared.

They return my medallion to me.

I am not this type of
person. Some thing happened.

Another person. She understands?

What you are to say me?

I am not an assassin.
He is not same?

Not.

It looks at, looks at.

It looks at.

It is not deceased.

It pardons me.

It pardons me!

Iâ€¦ perdoo you.

That excrementâ€¦?

A shot!

Here it says the policy!

They free its weapons and they leave
with the hands for top!

I have a target.

It arrives!

They stop!

Detective Lauro?

Senhorita Danes?

It is deceased.

The policy tried withholds it.

It had a shoot out.

Then it is everything finished.
Not even we know who it was.

It does not have as to identify
body. Not with certainty!

Some of the outlaws had run away.

They had been for some place of the city.

Perhaps you believe that it
she is alive?

What!?

I want that you know
that I fight in nameâ€¦

â€¦ of the fight of the world against
the violence and the fear.

E more than what this, for the peace
e harmony.

It looks at inside of itself.

We will come back to transmit again.

It has hundreds of disappeared women
in Juarez, who does not know the paradeiro.

Until today they continue to be
sequestradas, brutalized and assassinated.
