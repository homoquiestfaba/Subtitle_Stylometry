Yes, the problem and that we don't have nor it idealizes

You cannot make anything.

Do you want a little?
Yes.

Scat
Scat?

Lion shit.

Of agreement.

Judging by his/her consistence,
he/she ate r little time.

And difficult to know that, exactly.

He/she is a voracious hungry from the drought.

Or he/she ate a gazelle, which and good
because he/she won't be so much hungry...

Or then?

Or he/she ate another thing.
A human?

Judging by the temperature,
he/she defecated there is a pair of hours.

What means that already this
quite far away from here.

And that we do now?
Now we will camp.

Will we camp?
Exacto.

No forest guard had found his/her family
after putting of the sun...

Mr. Newman.

Li reviewed nalguma of fauna and flora.

I don't remember where,
but and rare that attack people.

I Read that they have more fear of us
of the one what us of them, no and truth?

Stupidity.
A starving lion eats what wants that is.

Amy, done these wake up?
No.

Me also.
The battery of my iPod finished.

Lament.

How did you meet my father?

Jess, don't want to speak of that now.

I only want to know.

Good... he/she was in an airplane...

Did they make him/it in an airplane?

If we made him/it in the airplane?

God! Lament.

Continue.

It was seating two lines behind him.

It was a flight for Chicago.

And the half of the flight...

...he came and he/she asked me one could sit down
in the empty seat, to my side.

Did he approach you?

What did want he/she?

We began to speak
and when I felt bill...

...we had to press the belt to cover with earth.

Of the one what did speak they?

Of things... his/her life, my life.

Things.

Is it then?

Then we covered with earth.

Your father had to be hit
another flight for New York.

You already imagine the surprise that I had...

...when I saw him/it to arise for my taxi.

Did he leave the airplane?
Yes.

He/she had un white lily.

Only a white lily.

And it invited me to eat lunch.

That curio...

Used to let to impress me
with things like this, but...

...he was so...

...persistent, do you understand?

Your parents were separate
when I met your father.

I swear you.
He/she would never have gone out with him if it continued married.

He/she would not be seating here right now
if he was married.

Yes. But here we are.

He/she is going r leaves of behind.

Stoop down! Stoop down!

Rest of the Leopard
pavilion of the luxury excrement...

They passed two days and two nights.

And if nobody doesn't come?

Tom will come.

Is it been not to meet?

Then we will wait.

Does it tie die of hunger?

We don't have a lot of opc.es.

We needed to go to a place
where they find us.

And as leaning to deceive le.es?

Maybe be full.

Maybe be full?

Maybe have eaten another person.

Maybe have given up.
Maybe have...

Yes, and maybe they are just waiting
that we leave.

We needed food.
We are dehydrated.

And this stupid car that before protected us
this falling to the pieces.

In some moment, we will have
that to leave the car and to see what happens.

Our only two opc.es right now
they are: or we died from hunger...

...or what do eat us?

I don't want to die here.
I won't leave that you die here.

What will make?

We are leaving with what have.

We needed of...

...for a barricade
in the windshields, of agreement?

I want that... Be careful with this.

I want that cut
the seatbelts...

...moorings in some way those seats
before the windshields, yes?

When you end,
we will cut these stuff and we will cover...

...the windows so that he/she doesn't enter the sun...
he/she makes too much heat in here.

Y I make the one what?

What can make?
Does to help me to do him/it inventory, ok?

Reviewed all of the pockets,
all of the sacks, all of the compartments.

I want to know that have exactly.

Mr. Crawford.

That has just pulled the foot.

David, for of looking.
But it pulled him/her the foot.

It is also found this.

And yes.

No and.

Ah, yes? Then of who and?

And mine, this certain?

Rs times tobacco when I am

It was nervous when I came for here and...

Rs times you leave me

I suppose that rs times we can be
an unbearable mouthful.

A little, I believe.

Don't worry.
Your secret this safe connosco.

Thank you.

This well, let us keep everything this.

Mr. Crawford, that no and a gazelle.

What did seek? What do make?
The rest of this type.

Wait there. Maybe have company.

They left all, suddenly.

As if they had fear or thing like this.

Fear?

Slowly. Let us retreat slowly.

He goes...!

That and a car?

Yes, and a car.

This on the other side of the cordillera.

The damned footprints disappeared.
Let us return to the jeep and let us proceed.

We will camp. Tomorrow of guile we will go to west.
Will we camp?

We will camp and tomorrow of guile we will go to west.

The forest guard this seeking to west.
He/she doesn't make sense to continue r it seeks in that area.

I propose that seek
where no this the forest guard.

Newman, some time was hit
a good fright, friend?

Yes?

More is worth that accepts the facto
that maybe don't find them never.

Let us leave the car and let us make noise.
And the lion? And if he continues there?

He/she left.

Well, I will approach the cordillera.
