That's the untraceable
question, but what is love?

Hmm. Mm. Mm.

Um...

People have tried to define
that for the longest time.

Love is when you can
look in each other's eyes

and just know they're...
she's gonna be there for you.

It's that sense of excitement

and... Adventure.

It's that feeling of
I can't live without her.

Don't want to live without her.

You want to be with someone,

take care of someone.

Be close with someone.

Caring for somebody
and their well-being

more than you care
for your own.

Finding someone you
can be compatible with

and be committed to.

Each year,
thousands of foreign women

marry American men

through so-called
international matchmakers.

A view from the room.

Come on, people, work with me.

One of the most important
things you'll ever do

is try to find that one person

you want to spend the
rest of your life with.

The international
matchmaking industry,

better known as
mail order bride business,

is booming.

Many of the men
that call me will tell me

it's difficult
to find women here

in the United States
that are even interested

in long-term relationships
and marriage.

There are so many

really sincere, wonderful,
wonderful women

in Russia, Ukraine,
China, everywhere,

who really want
to find somebody

to build family with.

Most of our clients,
they're not willing to settle,

so wy not look
for that life mate

in a different country?

There's a misconception
that these relationships

are set up to give
the men the upper hand.

I am upper hand.

You're the upper hand
in this relationship?

Are we ready to go?
We're ready. Let's do it.

You and me, babe.

How often does reality
really meet expectation?

Oh, quite often,

but it doesn't always
happen right away.

And welcome to
"a foreign affair live."

My name is John Adams,

co-founder of a foreign affair.

And I will be your guide
as we explore

the beautiful world of
international introductions.

I've always heard about
mail order brides.

Originally, a guy
would order a wife

with no idea,
maybe a picture of her.

But with the advent
of the Internet,

now it made things much
more visual and real

to see the girls,
to write 'em emails.

My name's Robert Wilson,

I'm from Fresno, California,

work in
heavy steel construction...

roads, Bridges, freeways.

Since my divorce,
it hasn't been great.

It's tough out there.

You know, when you have
a full-time job,

it's tough to meet people,

and I want to meet a woman.

One woman.

That's all I'm looking for
is one woman.

Meeting someone from overseas...

I feel like if I can
meet the right one

that she might be more serious

about actually
building a relationship

and giving it the time
we would need.

My name is Eric ireton.

I'm a mechanical engineer.

I live in San Antonio, Texas.

I'm 45.

What's your favorite gun?

Do you have it in there?

Favorite gun?

I don't know. It's hard
to have a favorite.

.357 Magnum.

The first handgun I bought.

Got my 12-gauge shotgun.

Ak-47, ar-15.

A little .22 caliber

with a 20-gauge shotgun
over/under.

When was your last
serious relationship,

like, here?

I've never had one.

I tried the army and a few of
these other regular dating sites.

Never worked for me.

My name's Bobby Cannon. I'm 46.

And I work in human resources

for the federal government.

And my views are mine alone,

not the government's.

So this is the living room.

This is where I spend
most of the day

when I'm at home.

I've got some of my collection.

I tend to be a little bit shy,

so I don't meet a lot of folks

for relationship purposes.

And to be honest, you know,

I'm a little bit heavier,

so that is something
that is a real negative

in the United States.

I hated dating.

I got on your popular sites,

and my first five dates

lasted less than five minutes.

All five of 'em.

I'm Ron Kirby. I'm from
north Carolina at pinehurst.

I married
my childhood sweetheart.

Met her when she was 12.
I was 13.

Got married at 18.
Three kids by 26.

We were married for 28 years.

If there was one thing
missing in our marriage,

it was this:

I felt taken advantage of.

What I wanted from my wife

was a pat on the back
now and then,

an "attaboy, I'm proud of you."

Just not being
taken for granted.

I do want to be married,

so I got to looking
on the Internet.

And of course, you know, you can
find anything on the Internet.

My name's Travis needham
from plain, Wisconsin.

38 years old.

So how many cows
are you going to milk today?

About 170, 175.

I don't know the exact number.

I know it's a lot more
than I want to milk.

I haven't really
dated a lot of girls,

other than one, and...

Let's just leave it at that.

Where are all the women
in this town?

There's a lot of guys.

I could think of six single
women off the top of my head,

and probably most
are divorcees.

Around here, work ethic.

You don't got time.

I wouldn't take it
as a personal thing.

It's just there's not
a lot of women here.

It's almost like living
with the eskimos, you know?

I got frustrated
with American women,

so I typed into Google
something about Russian brides.

A foreign affair came up.

Welcome to
the fascinating world

of a foreign affair,

where true love
knows no boundaries.

My name is John Adams,

president of a foreign affair,

and I would like to thank you
for taking the time

to learn more
about this exciting

and very real process

of finding
your special someone.

You look at John Adams...

and John, if you're
looking at this,

don't get mad at me...

but he's an average guy.

He isn't the best-looking
guy in the world.

He's a got a little bit
of a pooch, like he said.

And yet it worked for him.

I was lucky enough
to find my Russian bride

several years ago

with the assistance
of a foreign affair,

and I assure you that it
can work for you as well.

So then you have to say
if it worked for John,

you know, certainly, maybe,
maybe it could work for me.

She's kind of cute.

Cute.

Possibly.

A foreign affair

is really just
an international version

of any kind of
local dating service

that you would go to online

in order
to try to meet someone,

only we focus more on
the international sector.

We have about 16 or 17
different offices

around the world,
and we're dealing with

thousands and thousands
of clients every month.

All you do is find
the computers, you can register,

and you can start meeting
people from everywhere.

I was lucky enough
to meet Tanya

through a foreign affair,
actually,

so, yeah, I'm a great example

of how it can work,

and it does work.

What happens
when you're lucky enough

to meet the love of your life?

Over here.

What happens
when you're lucky enough

to meet the love of your life?

Pretty slow.
A little slow over here.

He's gotta wake up.
Get that coffee going.

I met John when I was 27,

and when I was 29,

I moved to the United States.

I came from
St. Petersburg, Russia.

John said it's my first
marriage and your last.

So, yeah, it's the second one.

The Internet really changed
the way we date,

both internationally
and domestically.

When the men do go to the site,

they have to register
on the site.

And then they can
start writing letters

to the women.

You've got to pay for letters

because it will actually
translate letters for you

and get them to the women

and get the replies
back for you.

I got on the afa website,

and I started
getting some letters

from some women in Ukraine.

I really didn't even know

what Ukraine was.

The women there
are just gorgeous.

I found 10 women
that I really liked,

so I started writing to them.

All 10 wrote back.

I spent a lot of money
in correspondence

and I thought, you know,
you just gotta go over there

and meet these women.

John: As the Internet does grow

and as the world shrinks,

people are going to continue

to start looking
outside the boundaries

because why wouldn't you?

It's right in
your own living room now.

I am Elena petrova.

I am the owner
of Elena's models,

a dating agency
that specializes

in introducing women
from eastern Europe

with men from
all over the world.

I was born in
yekaterinburg, Russia,

and I moved to Australia
to join my husband

about 15 years ago.

You were a popular
mail order bride.

Yes, I was a popular
mail order bride.

Marriage for a woman
in eastern Europe,

it's such a huge value.

It's so up there,

she's going to give up
anything to get it.

We have more than 200,000
active profiles.

We personally talk with
the majority of women

before we approve
their profiles.

Our business model
is very simple.

You place your profile.

You're responsible
for your profile.

We just do our best

to ensure that there are
only genuine, sincere people

on our website.

Okay. Let's go, mate.

God, dumb machine.

My name is Michael,

and I can actually say
that in Russian, too.

That's my name.

Nice area this, huh?

My first wife,

she left me after 10 years.

Threw all that out. So have I.

My second wife passed
away with cancer in '98.

She had leukemia
and it was quick.

We were only married
for four years.

Morning. How are you?

I'm not getting younger.
I don't want to be alone.

Been like that
for 12 years, you know,

and it's not really happy.

I support Elena's models

because it's the honor system.

You can contact
the girls, you know,

once they're interested in you.

And you can start talking
to them straight away.

Svitlana sent me some pictures.

That's svitlana.

There's also
another one she sent me,

and I really love this photo.

I don't know, because
I just like her smile there.

I saw svitlana.

She was a newcomer on Elena's.

I thought she looks nice,

and she had this sort of like
sad look in her eyes.

You know, I always
look for the eyes.

I don't know, you know.

And I thought I'll
give her a go, you know,

although she was,
like, 37 years old.

I thought, well, I'm just
gonna have a chat with her.

Sasha, Elena. Svitlana's girls.

Svitlana and that's Elena.

We started communicating
through Elena's

for a couple of months,

and then she gave me
her email address

and we started with email,
addressing her.

Elena: In Ukraine, there
is 87 men for 100 women.

And drinking is huge problem.

Most Ukrainian guys,

as they become
a bit older and older,

they drink more and more.

So lots of women
are using our website

to meet someone

simply because
there are not enough men

that she can choose from.

John: We want people to meet.

We want them to be successful,

to actually have
a meaningful relationship.

We always preach they should
actually get on a plane

and go over and meet
these women in person,

because that's the only way

anything's ever
going to happen for you

if you want something
to happen for you.

I'm sure you're wondering,

"can I really travel
halfway around the world

and develop
a meaningful relationship,

one that will result
in marriage?"

The answer is yes.

The romance tour
is absolutely amazing.

It is the best experience
that you'll ever have.

My cousin told me
he would never do it.

I said, "why?" He says,
"I wouldn't spend the money.

I'm too much of a tightwad."

And my answer was, "well,
what's happiness worth?

$12,000 to meet
a beautiful woman

that I love, that loves me?

That's nothing."

I don't really feel like
it's my last chance,

but I just didn't want
to be along anymore

and nothing was
happening around here.

Why would anyone else
spend this kind of money

to find a wife?

Bob: We're going to
three separate cities

during the trip: Odessa,
nikolayev, and kherson.

It starts in New York at jfk,

everybody's meeting
for the first time.

Everybody's kind of
sizing everybody else up.

It's kind of like a road trip

if you're in
a fraternity, in a way,

but it has a purpose,
of course,

which a road trip does not.

I'm Bob wray.

I'm a tour director

for a foreign affair tour.

There's a lot of faith
involved in this.

There has to be
because you're asking men,

look, fork over
a few thousand dollars,

take a couple of weeks
out of your schedule,

and come over with us.

That's ours?
That's ours.

Gotta move.

All right, guys. We made it!

Welcome to Odessa, Ukraine.

You can watch
the guys on the bus

and they're kind of looking
around out the window,

like, "wow, wow,
this is strange."

You can just see them
just thinking and looking,

and, you know, there's a
little bit of apprehension,

a little bit of fear, maybe,

a little bit
of all these things

going through their minds

because it's not the easiest
process in the world.

It really isn't.

Finding someone for
a relationship abroad

is very similar
to finding a job abroad.

If you can get better pay,

you probably will go.

Or if you want
adventure, you will go.

If I can get more
than I can get locally,

then I'll go.

One day, svitlana asked me,
am I for real?

I said I'm for real.
I'll come see you.

So I'm planning
to fly over to Kiev

for a week.

I don't like something
that's ordinary.

I like something that's
out of the ordinary.

I suppose that's why
I'm going to Russia for a girl.

I like something
out of the ordinary.

Michael: It's an adventure,
you know.

For me, I like adventure.

I feel motivated by doing it.

I really feel motivated.

I did not really achieve
what I wanted in life.

I need some more time.

I just want to be happy
and it doesn't matter where,

where I'm going to find it,
you know.

If it's here
in the Ukraine, why not?

I'll come here.

Yippy kay-ay.

All right, guys.

We're gonna get started here
with this orientation.

Now, a social,
it's not a cocktail party.

It's a great opportunity

to meet a lot of different
people at one time.

Right? It's all about
moving around

as much as possible
to try to meet

as many different people
as possible.

The first big event of this
whole tour is the social.

That's what everybody's
looking forward to,

so everybody is ready for that.

I don't have any expectations.

My plans are to shake the hands

of every single woman
there tonight.

Hi. I'm Ron.

I am Ron. And I am Ron.

I really want to welcome
you all for coming.

It's really important that if
you see someone that you like,

don't be shy.

Just go up to him

and say, hey,
can I talk to you?

I guarantee you that the men

are more shy than you are.

It was like being a kid
in a candy store.

I wasn't really quite
sure how to handle it.

My job is to go around

and encourage the men to be as
proactive as they possibly can

and talk to as many women
as they possibly can,

and have a good time
at the same time.

I'm overwhelmed by the
attention I've gotten.

A lot of my friends
who are single

thought I was crazy
to come over here,

but I tend to always
think outside the box.

We had 210 women
at that social.

20 guys.

A 10 to 1 ratio.

Welcome to paradise.

For me, it's been
very nerve-wracking.

A lot of beautiful women,

and it's not like that at home.

They just can't believe

that these women
are interested in them,

because they're used to
the situation at home

where nobody's
interested in them.

These women
believe in family first.

Not career first. Family first.

I'll tell you, it's like
dating a girl from the fifties.

It's like dating my mom.

ï¿½ American boys ï¿½

I can speak in front
of 3,000 people,

but getting on
that dance floor,

that makes me nervous.

You gonna do it?

Growing up Southern baptist,

I've never danced.

If I find the right one,
I might.

I've been trying to be
realistic in my search.

I'm in pretty good shape
for my age,

but I can certainly feel my age

in the last three years.

Would you like to dance?

Okay.

I want someone who still
loves me for me,

you know, when
I'm not as virile,

when I am starting
to fall apart.

You know, and I wouldn't mind

falling apart with someone.

My name is Ron.

My name is Serena.

So you speak English?

And how old are you?

It's a secret.

Well, that's important.

Yes, yes.

If you're 25 years
younger than me,

then they're not gonna be
falling apart with me.

Tell me about the woman
that you met.

What happened when you met?

Instant sparks.

I can't explain it.

Even though she speaks
very little English

and I speak no Russian,
it was just instant sparks.

Her name's Victoria.
We met at the social.

Danced for a while,
talked for a while.

I never left her side
till late the next afternoon

to go to the hotel, freshen up,

and went back to spend
more time with her.

In a perfect world,

this would just keep going

as awesome and wonderful
as it's been.

And if it keeps going
in the direction that it is,

I plan on being engaged
before I leave.

How are you?
Did you sleep well?

I did, the little bit
I slept, yeah.

Okay, guys, I'm glad to see
that you all survived.

Odessa so far.

So now that you have
one social under your belt,

you have a little better idea

how to manipulate
and maneuver in the social.

In nikolayev,
the social will be held

at a nightclub
that's called the illusion.

When you're dating, you know

that could be
appropriate, right?

You guys have fun with it

and hopefully you'll find
that one woman

that you can really
connect with.

We arrive
at the social at 5:00,

and it's jammed.

I mean, there are women
everywhere.

Guys are making time
in the line.

I mean, they're
talking to the girls

and the girls
aren't even in yet.

They got their coats still on.

They got one social
under their belt,

they're veterans now.
They're not rookies anymore.

They know what they're doing.

Ah, the beginnings
of another social.

How do they do that?

Did you see that?

I've been to Ukraine

on six different trips,

and when I walk in
to the social,

of course, I'm
always uncomfortable

'cause there's a lot
of people in that room

and there's a lot of beautiful
women in that room.

So the hardest part for me

is to just start
with the first one.

And I take my interpreter

and we start walking the room.

There sitting at
this table by herself

is a very tall, beautiful girl

with long blonde hair.

She fit all the criteria

that I kind of went
on this trip with.

We talked for quite a long time

and she was
definitely interested

in the possibility of
what it could turn into.

Some of these guys just
haven't dated in a long time,

and these passions,
these feelings

I don't think they've felt
for years and years.

And all of a sudden,

they're really just
exploring it all over again.

ï¿½ I want a girl like you ï¿½

ï¿½ who wants a boy like me ï¿½

ï¿½ who gets a girl like you ï¿½

I'm skeptical on this.

Having talked to some
of the translators here,

when I've asked them,

"tell me what percentage
of the women here

are truly in their heart
interested

in finding a man,
being married."

I mean, they're giving me
some really low numbers.

Do you have any children?

No.
Okay.

Hold on. I'm looking for
someone with no children.

I've certainly not met anyone
age appropriate for me.

Last night, I met
a girl at a social.

Somehow we started chatting,

even though she
doesn't speak English.

We ended up dancing together

the rest of the night.

And when we were at the club,

she asked me on a date,

so we have a date
tonight at 7:00.

And her name is vitalina.

I'm looking for
a partner, you know.

A lover, a friend.

I've got
a great life, you know.

There's just that
one piece missing.

Tell her she looks
very pretty tonight.

Thank you.

She say that she like you

from your first meeting,

and she say
she just want, like...

to hold with him,
that he hold me or hug me,

and just no talk.

Just sit and she feel
very comfortable with you.

Comfortable, yeah.

So we don't need
an interpreter for that.

I agree with you.
Yeah.

I agree with you.

I was sort of, like, nervous

because I didn't know
what to expect, yeah.

But I could see
she's all smiles

and things like that.

I believe that it's good

for both Western men

and Ukrainian women

to be able to explore
options elsewhere

because it's always great

when you can expand
your horizons

and understand
what is right for you.

I didn't come here
just for entertainment.

I really want to make it
with her, you know.

We've been talking about it
on the Internet all the time.

I told her we'll take it
one step at a time.

Who won? Who won?

I don't know.

All right, guys.

Well, you've now survived
two socials.

I congratulate all of you

for going to
the third and final social

here in kherson.

It's gonna be over
before you know it.

Nothing really matters.

Just go up, talk to
whoever you want to talk to.

Make something happen.

I mean, you know,
don't sit there and be shy.

Just go up and do it

because you'll probably
never see her again anyway.

She lives in the Ukraine.

This is your opportunity.
This is it.

It's the last city
and I'm down to one.

To be honest,
this is probably the one

that my eye
always came back to.

Her name is Julia.

She works at a travel agency.

Incredibly beautiful.

We've been writing
to each other

for... it's got to be
seven, eight months now.

We'll meet at the social.

I'm coming to basically try
to sweep her off her feet.

Do you have pictures of her?

Yeah.

How old is she?

26. She was a little bit
under my target age.

This is the one
from the website

where she looks like
Angelina Jolie.

Yeah. She does.

How can you go wrong there?

A little nervous.

Just waiting.

This last
hour and a half of wait

is just driving me up a wall.

Something a little special.

All the other guys,
they go out and buy roses.

I wanted to get
something that would last

hopefully as long
as the relationship.

So one gold rose.

Hopefully it gets her this
and everything will be okay.

And I'll be either
really happy or really sad.

This is like prom for old guys.

That's the way
I'm looking at it,

which is nice, since
I never went to prom, so...

Thank you.

I'm sort of hoping

to have a table off by
ourselves the whole night.

It will have a translator

because she doesn't
speak English,

I don't do Russian.

So we can just treat that
as our first date.

Every time I see someone with
black hair walk in the door,

my heart goes, uh!
Oh, it's not her.

Uh! Not her.

When I did my search, I looked
for certain specific things.

I like women that have
black hair, blue eyes.

People that are smart,
that are independent.

Someone that's gonna make me
want to be a better me.

Your climactic moment
is gonna happen any minute.

Yeah, I'm hoping.

When the guys come over,

they have their own set
of expectations,

which may be on target
and may not be on target.

And they think, oh, gee,

I've been writing to Irina,
svitlana, Elena.

I've been writing
to all these women

and they write to me,

and I wrote to them,
I told them I was coming over.

And maybe that works
and maybe that doesn't.

Hi. Are the women
checking in with you, too?

Only her.

Oh, okay. No English.

Perfect.

I thought she was going to show up.
I really did.

So I made sure I was
staying off by myself

because I didn't want to
have to fend off other women,

trying to keep them away while
I'm trying to wait for her.

Now, I wanted to come in here

to this place
to meet this person

and now I don't know
what's going on.

So how are you feeling?

Like anybody would feel.

Definitely not good.

So I had a conversation
with John this morning.

I said, you know, the lady
I'm talking to online,

the lady I'm writing to,

works full time
in a tourist agency.

Monday through Friday,
half a day Saturdays,

and isn't a student.

And the person
that Max is talking to

is a student half time.

I said, you know, I've
been writing this lady,

you know, almost daily
for months now.

Email are $10 a pop
going and coming,

so I'm probably out 10 grand.

My biggest fear
is that it was a scam.

That she's writing
to 50 or 60 guys

and she's getting
a cut of the fees

for the emails
going back and forth.

John said he's concerned
about that, too,

so he's trying to find out
what's really going on.

As he said, you know, well,
there's other women to meet.

I said I didn't come here
to meet other women.

That's not what I was here for.

I say, I can understand

why there's such a lot
of Ukrainian dating sites,

because the women here
are truly beautiful.

But I've only got eyes
for mine.

It's not easy giving
your whole life up and move.

Really, it's not that easy.

I live in Australia,

and there's
a lot of opportunity.

But then, she's got
a business here.

She's got her family here,
you know.

If she wants to have
a good life with me,

I will really look after her

and take care of her.

So she's got to decide
what she wants to do.

Max just called me and told me

that she'd be down there at
5:00 in the lobby, so...

They finally
got ahold of Julia,

and she is supposed
to be coming here

in about half an hour, hour,

for our first date.

I have to go in there

approaching it like she's
honest and all that

and hoping that
I'm not being screwed.

So...

And it's been hours.

I've been sitting here thinking
the same thing over and over.

How do I know?

How do you know?
How do you tell?

Hi.
How you doing?

Welcome.

Sorry.

We've been writing for about
seven, eight months now.

I was wondering
what your feeling is

on the relationship.

And what do you say?

We've been writing for so long,

I was hoping that we'd
be able to move on.

I came here to see you.

It's the only reason I came,

was to see if
you wanted to move

maybe further
in the relationship.

Do you feel like
she was the woman

that was writing to you?

I had some questions and doubts

because the pictures
I showed her

were pictures of things
that she's seen before...

the house, the yard, my work.

People in black.

This is actually pictures

from the last shuttle launch.

Wow.

If she wasn't the one
writing the letters,

does it matter?

It would have

and probably should.

But what I don't want to do
is for me to overthink it

and cause the problem
that isn't really there.

I guess, honestly, I can't get
this girl out of my mind.

Something that's special
and beautiful and unique

shouldn't be alone,
they should come in pairs.

And I was hoping...

I may not be,
you know, beautiful

and that unique, but I'm hoping

that maybe we could be a pair.

You are very inspiring.

Yeah.

And we'll have them, too.

Do you want to come to
America and marry me?

Let's move into this direction.

Okay.

Can I, please?

So, what was your
impressions of tonight?

I think it went really well.

I think I'm engaged now,

so I'd have to say
it's going really well.

Did you get her email address?

No. Gotta still go
through the service

because I need to have
the translations.

So we'll go through that.

I can ask her through that

if she wants to give me
her email address.

I don't know if she has one.

Didn't even think to ask.

A little preoccupied.

You're engaged.

I'm engaged.

I want to settle down again
with a good girl,

and I think svitlana
is a good girl.

We had a wonderful time
in Kiev.

I asked her
do you wanna marry me?

And she said yes,
and that's it.

So we're going
to get married in Bali.

I'm gonna try and I'll
give it my best shot.

If it depends on me,
I will make it work.

I'm very impressed
with the tour.

I think for the cost,
you get a lot.

Next Christmas, I would
like to be either married

or real close to being married.

They're not
that fucking friendly.

They're not.

Now that I'm leaving,
that's how I feel.

No, I don't think
most of the people here

like Americans particularly.

You take a woman
from the Ukraine,

and you have to overcome
the language barrier

if she doesn't speak
excellent English.

More importantly,
you have to overcome

the cultural difference.

But would I come back
to the Ukraine

or anywhere
to look for a bride? No.

I met one girl
that I really liked.

So we probably spent about

a total of three hours
actually face to face.

I was only hoping
that this would happen.

I never dreamed
that it actually would.

Yeah.

I really don't want to leave.

Kind of have to.

It's really rough
leaving Victoria here.

I'll try to keep in
constant contact with her.

Hopefully Skype a lot,
talk on the phone.

Anything else you want to say

before you say goodbye
to Victoria?

Too much. No, I can't.

You pretty torn up?

Yeah, very.

So are you gonna be okay?

I don't know. We'll see.

It's so hard to tell you

who I think will be successful,

because, to me,
if someone comes over

and has a wonderful time,
it opens their eyes,

that's a successful time.

But as far as finding
that one woman

and getting married, if you
define that as success,

that's really hard to tell

because this is real life.

This isn't controlled.

They're all adults
we're introducing,

and whatever happens happens.

It's been almost three
months since I've seen vica.

When I left Odessa,

I knew we had
a great connection

and, you know, we obviously
liked each other very much.

You know, I can't say
I was in love.

I knew I liked her a lot.

I've never felt that right
away with anyone else,

and I didn't want to lose that.

Come on, get up.

After coming back home,

I did not know
I was in love with her

until I seen the video
that afa had

on their website
from December tour.

Come on.

First time I seen it,
I balled my eyes out.

That was when I knew.

It just brought back everything

'cause I knew exactly
what she was doing.

She was singing to me
in Russian.

It brought that back instantly.

I still can't watch it.

I'll be there
in one week today.

I can't hardly sleep.

I've been to Ukraine
on six different trips

over the course
of about nine years.

I've probably dated
35 to 50 women

that I met there,

and all indications are
that I have found someone

that is truly serious

about building
a committed relationship

and coming to the U.S.

So I leave
on my seventh journey

in two days,

and we will be back together

in about a week and a half.

For inna.

I got her this engagement ring.

I can't wait to see you
at the airport.

I agree.

I'll miss you until I see you

at the airport.

Okay. Bye-bye.

Goodbye.

I really am looking forward

to coming through
that gate at the airport

and looking into her eyes again

and reconnect physically.

I just want to hold her.

Robert.
Hey, sweetheart.

How are you?

Oh.

I came back
and vita was available.

She would meet me anytime.

I said can we Skype
here, can we Skype...

she was available.

What did she say?

She's just laughing.

It's refreshing.

The innocence that she has,

it's just really made
an impression on me.

There's a lot of affection.

There was immediately.

When you're walking down
the street arm in arm,

who needs to speak
the same language, you know?

So when I came back,

within the first week or two,

I thought, "this actually
may work out."

And it wasn't
too long after that

I decided that I was
going back to see her.

And here's my lovely miss vita.

I went back with the idea

that I was gonna
ask her to marry me

and get engaged.

I think within
the first hour of being there,

I proposed to her, you know.

She said yes.

Logic would have said
wait a few days.

You never know.

The hell with logic.
It felt right.

And if anything, that made
the rest of the eight days

that much better.

She called her mom,
told her mom.

And then I asked that I would
like to meet her parents.

Probably the most nervous
on the whole trip

is when I met her parents.

I love you, Bob.

I love you, too, vitalina.

So what's the next step?

It's the application process
for the fiancï¿½e visa.

Eventually, she'll have
an interview with the embassy

where she'll
have to provide documents.

Once you file,
it's just waiting.

It's gonna be
a long six months.

Hopefully it works out with us.

If it doesn't, it doesn't.

I hope it does, I think
it is, but it may not.

You never know.

Two days before we got married,

I got an email that says,

my name is alexy.
You do not know me,

but I'm working with
svitlana for okina,

so I know her very well

and heard a lot about you,

so I want to warn you.

Svitlana works with
illegal dating agency,

which by fraud lures
foreigners to Ukraine

for dating beautiful women

and then takes all
their money. Bleed white.

I know that you have planned
a wedding in Bali.

She will fly to Bali
for your money.

She will bring the borrowed
wedding dress as proof.

But I can assure you
the wedding will not happen.

I told svitlana
about the bad email

that I got from Kiev,
and she's quite shocked.

I suppose it's somebody

that don't really want her
to get married.

The letter was saying,
you know, I'm just a donkey,

and they'll just
use me, you know.

I don't know.

I'm just very
stressed out, you know.

Already I can feel it.
It's building up again.

I was waiting for anything
to happen, you know,

but nothing happened.

We went to the Australian
embassy in denpasar

and we did the paperwork

and she was happy
to do everything.

You know, I mean, she could
have bailed out anytime.

She did not.

We can't get into
every person's head.

We don't know their motives.

We don't know how
they're going to feel

about this particular person,

how they're going to behave
in that relationship.

It's all basically
your responsibility.

And your responsibility is to try
to build a real relationship.

We got through.

We got married and that's it.

There's a temporary
visitors visa

where she can come over
in a matter of three months,

and I've got to apply for that.

So tomorrow we're going
our separate ways again.

How were you feeling
on your way home?

Mixed feelings.

I mean, sort of good
that, you know,

I met her and she was
a very attractive lady.

Thinking that maybe
something's going to happen,

but still had that
nagging feeling

that something was wrong.

But you left thinking
you were engaged.

I left thinking that we
were gonna get married.

When I got back,

we were corresponding
very, very frequently,

but every time I would
ask her something personal,

she just never answered
the question,

so it really started
bothering me.

Eventually I just gave up.

I said, listen, you either
gotta answer the questions

or that's it, I'm done.

I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

So she sent me one final letter

saying that
she was hurt, you know,

I wasn't the person
she thought I was.

I was like, well, okay.

It was over.

So why did you propose to her

knowing that
something was wrong?

What was I gonna lose
at that point?

You don't think that he
was mislead or scammed?

I don't think so, but
I'm not 100% sure yet.

You know, I have my doubts.

So we removed the woman
from the site.

We have taken her off.

You know, if she wasn't legit,

he still hasn't made
anything right by me.

I spent thousands
of dollars, you know,

just for the trip,

the letter translations
and photos.

Thousands of dollars
out of pocket for this.

All I can say is that
we worry about us.

We worry about
a foreign affair,

and we always try to do

the best we possibly can
for our clients.

We always try to act ethically.

If we find a problem,

we try to work to
resolve the problem.

There's always
gonna be problems,

but I think the measure
of the company

is how the company
deals with the problems.

Well, I'm in vienna right now.

We'll be boarding here
shortly, going to Odessa.

Pretty excited.

Can't wait to see you, vica.

Many people just assume

that women from other countries

are just looking to get into
America for a green card.

And after money.

I believe there might be a few
people out there like that.

But I think the majority
of the people

that actually going through the
process are fairly serious.

They're looking for love.

Hello.

Pretty!

Look what vica made me.
Balloons.

Vica. Vica wash clothes.

No, no. Please, no.

I disgusting here, okay?

Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

Well, this is my
third day here with vica.

I don't know what to say.

Not quite as I expected,
you know.

I thought everything
would be hunky-dory,

and I think everything's
gonna be all right.

I guess I...

For some reason, something
just doesn't seem right,

but I think everything's
gonna be all right.

I, uh...

I guess
I don't know what to say.

On the last day,
early in the morning,

somebody was banging
on the windows.

One was a police officer.

The other one was a loan shark.

The police officer explained

that she owed 4,000,

and he said if we
didn't pay it right away,

she'd have to go to jail.

And I said, well,
I don't have 4,000.

He said, well,
what do you have?

I said, well, I have
a couple hundred bucks.

And he said, if you give us
a couple hundred dollars,

we won't put her in jail.

So I just kind of
agreed with him

to make sure that I would
get to the airport on time.

I was hoping
to formally get engaged,

but everything
kind of seemed fishy,

so I decided not to.

It's 4:40 here in brisbane,

and it is 8:41 Ukraine time.

They don't really make
a specific time

for me to chat on Skype,

and that's why I get tired,
really tired,

because I sit long
hours here, you know,

waiting for them to chat to me.

Do you feel like she's
avoiding your calls at all?

No, I don't think so.
No?

I don't think so. Uh-uh.

No, when I get through,
she'll talk to me.

How long has it been
since you talked to her?

Not... before the wedding.

Who's this?

Cat. It's Lisa.

My cat.

We all want to believe
in something better.

We want to believe
that it's for real.

We want to believe that
it's gonna work out.

And so this is why
they continue with that,

because they kind of have already
investment and attachment.

I have a Skype
appointment today.

Busy.

Busy. She's busy on the phone.

I'll try again.

I like to be in control.

I like to be
in charge of a situation.

Then I know what I can do,
what's my next step,

and that's how I plan my life.

And I feel like
I cannot control it now

because I've got no means

of communicating
with her properly.

Do you feel like
you're actually married?

That's the worst part.

I don't feel like it, no,

because there's not really

a lot of communication
between us.

There was no intimacy
between us.

What do you mean?

No sex, nothing. Nothing.

The fiancï¿½e visa is at
least a six month process,

sometimes even eight months,

and during that time,
a lot's gonna happen.

They do a criminal background
check and a medical.

And they're looking for things
like tuberculosis or aids,

things like that
that would prevent her

from coming
to the United States.

It's everything incredible.

Everything's bigger?

Bigger, yeah.

Big trucks, big houses,
big supermarkets.

Big love.

Yeah.

Went to uvalde this weekend

with the main purpose of
introducing inna to my family

and showing her a little bit
of the town where I'm from

and getting her to
actually see and experience

some of the things I've
been telling her about.

You okay?
Yes.

How did your parents feel
about you coming over here?

What they think, my parents?

Yeah. Was it... I'm sure
it was very hard for them.

Yeah, of course.

My mom feels sad. Very cry.

And when we were
both in Ukraine,

just when we talk about this,

always cry.

And when I go, it's too much.

It was very difficult,
of course.

I don't imagine that...

I didn't imagine that
it was so difficult.

Oh, I was so backward.

I grew up in a very small town,

and I was scared to death
of the world.

I couldn't have gone
to some other country.

Anyone that would
make the effort

to come to the United States

from a country like Ukraine,

it's gotta be hard.

Something really driving
them to want to do that,

to leave behind
their family, the home,

the only home they've known,
all the familiarity.

Motivation can be either
positive or negative,

and, you know, fortunately

all that I've experienced

that she's here for
all the right reasons.

He's showing us
that video of her family,

our families are not that
much different, you know.

I can see they were doing

the same kinds of things we do

and it's kind of
the same place, you know.

People are more alike
than they are diverse,

so it's kind of
two worlds together.

It's a very big challenge

and it will take constant work,

but so is every other
relationship.

Just as you get older,
you have new challenges,

but you don't expect it.

I think that people are old enough
to make up their own minds,

and they should be able
to decide for themselves

what they want to do
with their lives.

It's their business.

I wouldn't intrude on that
one way or another.

So the flags are up
for Memorial Day,

which is in about a week.

I want to take a picture.

With the flags?

Yeah. Yeah. Just do it quick.

One, two, three.

One of my biggest fears

is this whole thing
not working out.

To me, this is for life,

and that's what I'm
certainly hoping for

and doing everything I know to
see that that's how it goes.

All I can say,

I'm going to give it
my best shot now.

I don't care what people say.

I'm going to give it
my best fucking shot.

Even if it means to you
moving to Ukraine

and fucking leave
my fucking lovely life

there in Australia
behind, fuck that.

I can have the same life here.

But I feel
I want to be with them,

with svitlana and the kids.

That's it, and I'm gonna do it.

Hi.
You look so beautiful.

Oh, thank you. I love you.

I love you so much.

I love you.
I miss you.

So together forever,
so together.

Together forever. Yes.
Together forever.

Where you at, in Kiev?

Yes. Home tomorrow. Tomorrow.

Tomorrow?
Yes.

Back to nikolayev?
Yes.

So how do you feel?

What's happening today?

Today we're going to
the justice of the peace

for our legal marriage.

Eric and inna.
Okay, here we go.

Greetings
to friends and family.

We're gathered here today

to celebrate the lives
of Eric and inna,

who will now be joined
in marriage.

Now, their marriage

will be the intertwining
of two life stories.

As individuals,
they bring to the marriage

their own unique history

as they choose to set aside
the single life

and unite as one.

Eric, do you take this woman

to be your lawfully wedded
wife, to have and to hold,

richer or poorer,
sickness and health

till death due you part?

I do.

Inna, do you take this man

to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

to have, to hold,
for richer, for poorer,

sickness and health,
till death due you part?

I do.
There you go.

So by virtue of the authority
vested in me by law

as justice of the peace
precinct 2,

I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

Oh, that's sweet.

She's here already.

She's here. She must
have started early.

You can stand a little bit.

Translator: Sorry, Michael.
Please don't get offended.

It's just that I don't
like the dead flowers

and I told you before that
I like the live flowers...

I didn't know that...

she said I shouldn't
buy her flowers,

but I never knew
the reason behind it.

Translator: She had
orchids on her wedding.

The wedding was decorated
with orchids.

Oh, well.

It was a very beautiful...

these were
very beautiful decorations

and everything
was very beautiful,

but anyway,
this was a big mistake.

What?

The wedding was a mistake.
Hmm?

The wedding was a mistake.

The wedding was a mistake?

Why did she wait
all this time then

to tell me only now?

She says that the only email

that she sent to you
after the wedding,

actually said

that she doesn't want
to continue any longer.

No, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

I actually remember
that email now.

She was saying she don't know.
She's very unsure of herself.

She was very unsure of herself.

That's what she was saying.

But she won't be able
to be your wife,

and actually it's time to quit
this interview because I don't...

no, no, no, no,
it's not over yet.

Let's think about it.

No, no, let me...
let me... let me...

let me explain.

You're not going anywhere

until we sorted this thing out.

If you don't like a person
from the first start,

you should not get
involved in relations.

Not even get married
to that person.

That is totally not on

to get the person
to take you to Bali,

get married to them,
and then afterwards,

you just disappear,
you just get quiet.

You know what, I just feel

like I've been used by her.

That's all I feel now.

And maybe that email that I got

from that alexy is right,

that you just
use people like me

to just get your kicks

for a cheap holiday.

Can I have my ring back?

It's already here.

Where?

It's in the...
Near the flowers.

Can I go now?

Okay. Goodbye.

Okay. Goodbye.

It doesn't make sense, really.

So what are you going to do?

Well, get the fuck out of here.

So what else can I do, huh?

At the end of
"the wizard of oz,".

Dorothy says
something like this,

I've learned that
if what I'm looking for

is not in my own backyard,

then I didn't need it anyway.

So I've learned
some appreciation

for the women back at home.

I'm dating a woman now,

and we actually dated before
I went to the Ukraine.

And then we broke up

and I think I had
some areas in my life

that I needed to give on.

I think she has some that
she needed to give on.

A special person like that

doesn't come around
but so often.

After all this, I got
depressed for a while.

It really, definitely
affected me.

I sat around.

I actually went and got
some bupropion

to help with that.

Finally worked through it.

Pretty much stopped
trying to date,

anything like that
until just recently.

I figured I might try it
one more time.

This is her, huh?

Yeah. This is becka.

It's not the same as Julia.

I'm getting personal responses

and actual, you know,

it looks like someone's
actually putting some thought

into the email.

Do you ever just feel like
you're just writing a photo?

Yeah.

Would you say you're
in love with vica?

Right now I don't know.

I thought I was,

and then...

It's this money thing.

It's completely the money.

If it wasn't for the money,
there'd be no doubt.

It seems like it's gotten
worse after this last trip

as far as asking for money.

I don't... I told her,

no more after this last trip.

I'm to the point
I'm just fed up with it

because if we weren't going
through the visa process,

there's no way I'd
keep going on with it.

There was no fear
of getting married

and marrying vita like,
you know, the jitters,

the pre-wedding jitters.

There was none of that.

This is what I wanted

was someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

Robert...

Robert...

Today I give...

Today I give...

My love...
My love...

To you.
To you.

Most people think it's
the guy going over there

and they pick the woman.

They're not waiting
to be picked.

They want the same relationship

that every other woman wants.

They don't want just anybody.

They want someone
that's right for them.

I'm a reasonable person

and he is, too.

And I always know that
I need to have man

who I will respect.

It's a very good feeling

when you think...
when you wake up

and think how I love here.

It's very good.

I've seen things in Eric

that I've never seen before
when he's with inna.

He's always been
thoughtful and kind,

but more attentive, more aware.

This year I got
a mother's day email

with pictures from them.

He'd never sent
a mother's day card.

Things are awakening in him

that he's never
had to think of.

Your mother and father told us

about a big development.

Oh, yeah?

Yeah, that is true.

What is it?

Pregnant. I'm pregnant.

About four months.

I have family,
what I always imagined.

I'm so happy for him
to have somebody,

somebody to be with,

somebody to do things with,

somebody to love.

You need somebody to love
and to love you.

John: Guys, it'll never
ever happen

just sitting on your couch,

whether you go with us
or you go with someone else

or you, I don't care,
get on a plane

and just go
over there yourself.

Put yourself in an opportunity
to meet someone.

Rob, will, everybody,
thank you very much.

Yes. Thanks for having us.

And we will see you
in just two weeks

with another great show.
So until then, bye-bye.

What is love?

Love.

I will start to cry.

Love is when you can say

that I will just give
my life for somebody.

I think that's love.

How does one find love?

I don't know.

I think you have to be
lucky to find it.

You have to keep looking

and if you are lucky,
you will find it.

If not, some people
will never find it.

So you just need
to keep looking.
