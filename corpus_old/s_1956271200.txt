Who are we talking about?

Oh!

Yeah, that little fish who crossed the ocean to find her parents.

Her parents!

Oh, yeah. no, no, I've known her since she was a cute little guppy.

When I meet her, I don't know,
I got a strange first impression.

I will be honest, the second impression wasn't much better.

Well, I don't ...

Look, I don't want to brag, but I could sense her before I saw her

No, I'm not kidding

Yes, I have this thing called echolocation.

Well, it's ...

You know what, rather than explaining it, I can give you a little

Sure. Uhh, if you could just give me a little bit of room

Thank you so much.

Okay.

She never said any mean word to me

Always good.
Always good.

Always forgiving.
Always forgiving.

You know, giant heart.
Giant heart.

Yeah.

Okay, here we go

Just a second

Just a second

This never happens

Somebody wearing metal?

You know, it's funny, I thought she didn't likes me at first

because she could never remember my name

But then I realized she never remembered anyone's name.

You have got to want it.

You got to want it. Get in there

Here we go.

Now, I'm feeling it. And there it goes.

I don't know what's happening, and I apologize.

Here's the thing though. I don't usually don't care for upbeats so much.

But she grew on me, okay

She tends to grow on you, whether you like it or not.

I am quite large.

She used to play hide-and-seek in my mouth

Olly, olly oxen free.

Um, I don't remember any of that
