Are you planning
on fixing that latch?

[Eva continues laughing]

I was very flattered.

-"But,

"I was not pleased to read,

"'No good in bed, but

[laughter continues]

[clock ticking]

Hmm?

Hey, I heard a good
one the other day.

"Cartoonist found dead in home.

"Details are sketchy."

"Details are sketchy."
He's a cartoonist!


It's like a pun.

It's not very good.

-You gotta get going.
-Max?


My shows are on.

And you have to get
back to your class.


It's fine. I want
to be here with you.

No. Now is...

-[Max] Please?
-I'm staying.

You're impossible!

Where do you think

loved fresh flowers
here, so I'll just...

-[Chris] You got that?
-[Annie] Uh-huh.


[jazz music playing]

I, uh, brought some movies.

I thought that might
be a good thing.

comedies. I remembered you...

Always loved comedies.

This one...

Is about a high
school gym teacher...

Who has big plans
for the summer...

but, is forced...

to cancel them to teach
an English class of misfit,
goof-off students.


his unconventional
brand of teaching
begins to inspire them.

I don't, uh...

Well, there's two of them.

[footsteps approaching]

-You got them?
-[Annie] Yeah.

-Oh, those look nice.
-[Annie] Mm-hmm.


to watch a movie?

-Well, I was just suggesting...
-[Max] We're fine, Chris.

We're fine.

Oh, I, uh...

I thought, uh...

we'd make a night of it.




That's fine.

I'm going to leave these...

in case you, uh...

There's no DVD player, huh?



Uh, Pop, uh...

I'm sorry.

[opens door]

[door shuts]

[Eva laughing]



[Eva laughs]

[man on TV]
Can't   see the rest.
Windows, windows, windows...

It's ideal,
this is a dream house.

I'm glad you like it?


Grandpa.

Hey?

Max, let's go upstairs, huh?

right here, Annie.

Max, it's time to go
to sleep, okay?


to go upstairs.

[Annie whispering] Okay, uh.


[piano music playing]

remembering Mom's birthday,
when I was quite young.

I don't know how old,
maybe five, six...

You and I made her cookies,
for her birthday.

And then we forgot
to turn the oven on.

we presented them,
she still ate two.


Have you thought any more
about something you might like
to say?

I think I'll do
a little soft shoe.

You can just express
whatever you're feeling. Okay?




Sixty five years.

I can't even remember...

my life without her.

Everyone tells me...

this is...

going to get better...

And easier.

I know they believe that.

But I can't see that happening.

I'm 87 years old,
and I've lost my Eva.

The truth is...

I've lost her a long time ago.


her life with me...

was a lie.

I don't blame her.

I blame myself.

She thought...

she married a
different kind of man.

A better man.

But, she was...

mistaken.

I'm a failure.

I failed my wife...


I...

failed my family.

I failed myself.

[microphone feedback]

You said something
to... that...

A few things today
I found distressing.

-Distressing?
-[slams table]

what distress is!

My wife, the love of my life,

is dead!


And you want me to sit here
and converse with you!

Okay.

I want you to know that
nobody thinks you're a failure.

a lovely marriage.

You have a family
that loves you.

You made a beautiful record.

Did something happen
between you and Mom,

that...

you haven't told me, or anyone?

No!

Nothing!

Absolutely nothing!

When Kat's father died,

her mom went to a
bereavement counselor,

"I'd like to make a
phone call, to see if..."

To make the phone call
and see if they'll accept you!

to your brilliant suggestion.

You're in pain.

That's all I see...

is someone in pain.

you talk to some...
someone else.

Someone outside the family.

You can't talk to me,
you won't talk to me.

Is he talking to you
about any of this?

About the stuff that he said
to a room full of strangers?

Enough!


[door slams]


ask you something,

but you have to be sure to
tell me if I'm out of bounds.

Why wasn't Scott here tonight?

He's in Chicago.

[distant dog barking]

No. He, uh... He took a job
with the philharmonic there.

Why aren't you there?

It's complicated.


Just go.


the restaurant...

on the moon?

They serve great food,
but no atmosphere.

Hoo-hoo.

He, he, he.

Are you sure you
don't want me to stay?

We could make Chicken Annie.

No, I want you to go home...

and get some sleep.


It still doesn't feel real.


Chicken Annie,

tomorrow. I'm holding
you to it, Buster.


[door opens]


[door closes]


[water flowing]

I thought about?

I was just lying there,

listening to you breathe.

And I never told
you, Eva, but...

You breathe nicer
than anyone I've
ever known in my life.

And...

I'm thinking to myself,

"We've had 65 years together,

but we never...

figured how old we were...
together.

-[Max] Do you know how old?
-[Eva] That's because my
arithmetic is so...

We're a hundred and
sixty nine years old.

Each?

No, not each!

-Both of us together.
-Oh, really?

A hundred and sixty-nine
years old.

It's a hell of a long time.

-[Max] Yeah.
-I wish we'd been together
a hundred and sixty-nine years.

when you get agitated.

-[Annie] Max?
-Yes.

that stuff yesterday?


Thank you.

Will you talk to me, please?



I always loved this.

[taps table]

Open it up.


What is that?

She never let me play with it.

you gave it to her.

Uh.

There are a thousand
explanations for this,

so, whatever you're thinking,
I'm sure you're wrong.


Let's make some dinner, okay?



where I said?

Yes I am, honey.


Uh, my eyes are on the floor.

[piano music playing]

[thumping on floor]

Stairs...

and...

escalator.

-[Max] Oh, God!
-[laughing and clapping]


I have a couple
of jokes for you.

Um, I asked
my 5th graders at school,

their favorite jokes.

What does a fish say
when it runs into a wall?

"Dam!"


Um...

Let's try, uh...

What do you get when
you cross a vampire
and a snowman?

Frostbite.

[Annie laughing]


Thank you! Thank you.


-[Max] Let me give
you a little sugar.
-[Annie] Mwah.

I'm so proud of you.
You were so good.

[Annie laughing]

You look like a skinny,
Roseanne Barr.

[Annie laughing]

Were meant to share

[floor creaking]

Eva.

Eva?

Are you there?


I know,

that we do things...

And we do things...

that we hope will
make us feel better.

-I feel better...
-[Annie] Max?

calling your name.

-[Annie] Max.
-Yeah, honey.

-[Annie] Max.
-I was... I was just
looking for my glasses.

Who are you talking to?

Let's go downstairs. Let's
go back to sleep, okay?

Yeah. Okay.

-[Max] Yeah, okay.
-[Annie] Okay.


to go back to sleep?

-[Annie] Uh-huh.
-[Max] Okay.



-[Max] Cause then we'll all be
sleeping at the same time.
-[Annie] Yeah.


[cello music playing]

[cellphone vibrating]

-[Annie] Hi.
-[Scott]  Hey, did I wake you?

-[Annie] No, no, I'm up.

-[Scott]  Is he there?


Any better?


about it later.

I looked at the flights...

Yeah. Look, uh...

I don't even know what's
going to happen this weekend,
so just...

Don't come, okay. I might be
with him the whole time.

I want to be there for you.

I'll come by after work.

Annie,

I don't want to be a burden.

You could never ever
be a burden, Max.


Hey, remember when
I peed on that clown?

[Max laughing]

That was the best
part of his act.


Yeah.

[Annie laughing]

Okay. I'll see you later.


You gotta take a bath.

about you if I could.

I love you just as you are.

He was here.

[instrumental music continues]

November 5th,

1959.

[instrumental music playing]

What are you looking for,
for God's sake?

to find a picture of him?

preoccupied with success.

Or should I say, failure.

Poor Max.

He didn't want to wake you.

And, your gray slacks...

were in the kitchen trash.

having them cleaned.

For what?

having them cleaned?

Because they were
in the kitchen trash.

And, look...

It's a new scarf.

Well, what's the matter
with my old scarf?

Nothing. I just...

Grandma was knitting this
for you, and so I finished it.

I gotta go home.

You said you'd give this a try.

I did. I gave it a try.

One night's not enough.

Well...

somebody...

has got to keep an eye
on the kitchen sink.

-It's got some leak.
-[Annie] I'll do it.

What do you mean you'll do it?

Yeah, don't worry about it.

You don't know how to do that.

I'll get a plumber to do it.

Oh, sure. Spend a lot
money. That's terrific!


I gotta go home.




I saw the picture.

Did you know him?

[knocks on door]

How are you doing?

Time for your pill.

I'm Colleen.


have those, okay.


Come on, now. Come on,
come on. Let me up.

All right.

Now, listen, I'll make
up your bed for you.

It's a nice place. You're gonna
like it here, I think.


All right. Let's see,
well, how you're doing.

Let me have this.


Here's your book.

Glasses.


Okay. I'll see you at dinner.


I'm, Colleen. It's time
for your pill.

How are you feeling, Mr. Rose?

Wonderful.

I'm in  One, Who Flew
Over the Cuckoos Nest.

[Ms. Flowers laughing]

Well, uh, I wanted to ask
you here because, uh,

I thought it was really
important for you to
have some, uh...

social interaction with...
with your peers.

And I was wondering if you had
a chance to look at some of the

fantastic activities
that we have here.

Activities?

[Ms. Flowers] Well, we've got
some, uh, great activities
like cooking class.

Do you like to cook?

[Ms. Flowers] Um...

Book club?

There is, uh, what about,
uh, working out?

Do you like to work out?

It's very good to exercise
at your age, Mr. Rose.

You know, I read in your file
that you're a musician.

Yes, some time ago. Yeah.

[Ms. Flowers] Mm-hmm.

Well, we've got this
performance series
every Wednesday...

where I could really use...

your talent.

Maybe you could... consult?

Listen, if you think
a cooking class is stupid...

[Ms. Flowers]
You know, that's fine.

You don't have to cook.

I'm just trying to help you.
I'm here to try to help you

find a little bit of happiness.

[Ms. Flowers]
Does that make sense?

[Ms. Flowers]  If you want to
sit in your room all day long,

and stare out the window
and feel sorry for yourself,
you can be my guest.

But I'm here to help you.

If there's anything
that you want to talk about,

I know there's a lot of
adjustments going on
right now, so...

Please come
talk to me, okay.
I would like that.

You live here now.

And I believe
that a whole new world could
be opened up to you.

But I'm gonna
need you to participate.

Could you pick out one...

And, um...

Four out of five,

if not historical.

of the place, so we, um...

we went in there...

and, uh...

and I thought it was good.

-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Annie] It was okay.

I don't know if I'd give
it four out of five, per se.

See what I made.

Oh, wow!

Pot holders.

In the shape of a body part.

These are kidneys.


These are great.

How's it going in here?

Okay.


Dad talked to the
real estate agent.

And she said the offer
from the Kay's is the
best we can expect.

Then we don't sell the house.


the thing is...

you need the money,

to cover the cost
of living here.

Look, I took the offer.

You took the offer?

It's like Annie said. This...

This place is very,
very, expensive.

The house...

wonderful memories
and a great life...

that... that we all had
there at some point, and...


You have to sell
in order to stay here.


to sell!

You put my name on the deed.

That was a convenience.

I did what had to be done.



Great to see you, as always.

One of your big shot friends?

bought it for yourself,

so you could go
and get another wife,

and a bunch of kids
that you don't take care of.

I take care of my kids.

for, Annie?

I, I care about you, Pop.
I don't want to fight.

I don't need
you to care for me.


we, we got to, uh,
deal with this.

Deal with what?

I'm not angry at you, Pop.

I love you.


I love you.

You try to say it?

I love you.

Okay.

All right. You win.

Scott's fine.

Anything new?

Maybe, about Chicago?

You know, I've got my kids
and my class here, so...

Do you know...

If they could package
how I feel about you...

millions of dollars.

Max, you're too mean to my dad.

You don't have to defend
your father, Annie.

I know. I don't have to.

He wants to be close to
you and you won't let him.

Annie, I'm just a little
bit older than you, but,

I think I know my own son.

No!

No. I don't think you do.

He has a lot to handle
right now between me,

and you, and everything
that's going on with, Kat.

He's being a good father to me.

He is.

Even if you won't see it.

And he tries to be a good son.

You're a different
person with him, Max,

and it isn't fair.

I know exactly
what you're doing.

You're staying here...

because of me.

But I'm fine, Annie.

I am.

I'm sleeping better.

I keep busy.

And all that stuff you...

you said at the
funeral was right on.

You were absolutely right.

And grandpa is okay.


I found it in one of
her books last week.

a thousand ways whether
I should give it to you.



[knocks on door]

Don't you know

"I can make a fortune if I can

And he goes to the owner
of the dog, he says,

How does a dog learn
to davin? He says,

-"The dog is Jewish..."
-[Max] Okay.

so he says, uh...

Producer says,
"I'd like to get the
rights to use that dog."

And the owner of the dog says,

"That's a very tempting offer,

but the dog has his mind

You know why?

Because...

I'm a star.

TV star.


I had my own series.

For fifteen years...

Everybody knew
me on the street.

with their babies and kids,

wanted my autograph.

You can't buy that, Max.

That's a gift.

You know, and I've been
very, very, fortunate.


what's your story, man?

You can tell me.

I'm your friend.

Is it bad?


If by bad you mean the
worst possible scenario...

Then, yes.

"Eva,

it's all settled.

I will arrive on the 5th,
after Max departs for his
recording session in New York,

I eagerly await an audience
with your latest pieces.

And, as always,

It's me, Lee.

What's up, man?


[Lee laughing]

Yeah, I'm doing all right.

Listen...

You remember this guy,
B.S. Tracey, that used to
give all those pool parties?

Yeah, him.

B.S. You got it.

You still have his address?

Is it now? Okay, well
lay it on me, man.

Hold on a minute.

Bob diddy, da, da, da.

That's it. Yeah, I got it.

Okay. Thanks again. Take care.

Hey.

[car approaching]


An old flame?

I gotta do.


Grandpa!

Grandpa, Max.

Grandpa, Max!


Hi, darling.

How are you two? You both
getting ready for bedtime?


I wish I could go with you,

'cause I'm so sleepy now.

-[Chris] You want to
play with your grandpa?
-[kids] Yeah!


Is that the way you like it?

-[Lucy] Yeah, and then
put that on.
-[girl] Put the hat on.

not wear a hat.

-[kids] Why?
-[Max] Cause I'll muss my hair.

-[kids] No, you won't.
-[Max] And I combed
my hair this morning

-for over 35 minutes.
-[kids] We won't muss
your hair.

mess your hair up.

-[Max] You cant have the nose.
-[girl] Why?

-[Max] 'Cause it's my nose.
-[girl] It's not your nose.

-Yeah.


Put your hand out. Let me see
if I can fit it on your nose.


Lucy, you don't
have enough nose.

They're great kids, Chris.

I know.

Are you doing okay?

I don't know.

My marriage is falling apart.

My mom just died.

My dad thinks I'm
a waste of space.

I'm great!

I don't think you're a waste.

No?

Then why is it that's
one of the nicest things
you've ever said to me?

You know how you think back...

to when you were younger
and you had wonderful dreams.

so beautiful, and pretty,
and nice...

and loving.

Those things just
don't go away.

We're guilty of
pushing them away.

I'm still a little groggy.
Is that an apology?

Don't push it, Chris.

You had your music.
You had Mom.

You guys somehow
loved each other

day in, day out,

for 65 years.

I'm two marriages in,
I still can't figure it out.

Sometime you have to act...

the way you feel.

The way you really feel.

That'd be nice.

Got anything in mind?

He's in there.

Good luck.

[clock ticking]

[clock chiming]


So close. I almost
made it underground...

without seeing your face.


Come here.

[labored breathing]

Come on over here.
Come here!

There you go,
you can do it.

[footsteps ]

Come on, have a seat.

Do you play the piano?

[Ben laughs]

No, just sit down.

Come on,
come, on, come on.

Sit down,
sit down, sit down.


I got cigarettes there,
can you get me one?

Ahh.

Okay, good. Yeah.

How about a light?

I know it's asking a lot.

[strikes lighter]

[Ben groaning]

[Ben exhales]

Eva...

Lillian Rose.

by her son, Christopher,

her grandchildren,
and of course...

ahh...

by her beloved
husband of 65 years,

Max Rose.

Hmm.

You don't know how
disappointed I am.

I was hoping
you would go first.

[Ben groans]


Uh.



What do you know about me?

You're my wife's lover!

[Ben laughs]



[water flowing]

I, uh, I bought your
wife's drawings,

so it's strictly a professional
relationship, okay?

I don't believe you.

Huh, well, you shouldn't.
It's a lie.

I want the truth!

[Ben laughing]

Max Rose wants the truth!

Everybody get that?





Now, that's the finest
chair in my house,

the most comfortable,

I hope you like it,
because it's throne-like,
and that befits you.

I'm saying? Um, um, oh...

Here's...

to dying.

with a slap on the ass,
and then we end up...

jealous old men,
wishing we had
what the other guy's got.





it's what we do in the middle.

And I got mine.

Hollywood, big time.

was impressed. That bastard!


Did you have
a relationship with Eva?

Yes, no.

What do you think?

November the 5th, 1959.

You crazy son of a bitch!

You come onto my doorstep
and ask me about one thing
that happened 50 years ago!


happened that day?


I don't remember.


[switch clicks]

November 5th, 1959.

Where did you get that?

[clicks open]

[Ben sobbing] She...

Oh, she kept it...

She kept it.




out on the table there?

[Ben coughing]

[clears throat]

[labored breathing]

Life goes on, huh?


[labored breathing]


I met, Eva...

at USC.



she was something more.

This woman gave
with her whole heart.

Then, uh...

she met you.

That, uh, you were playing
at some club or another.

And she was so
smitten with you.


Some cliche, some
passionate artist?

I, I could have
made you myself.

But she thought
she was in love.

And then she made...

the crazy decision
to marry you.


But I had to keep
her in my life, so...

I bought her drawings.

As I told her. She was
some kind of a Picasso.


But, she didn't care.

But I finally started
to get to her.

Yeah, November 5th, 1959.


and...

And I went all in.

"Leave with me.

Let me take care of you.

Let me rent you a studio, and
you could be a real artist."


What happened?

[Ben sobs]

What do you think happened?

She wouldn't leave you,
you putz.


I gave her this...

as a little reminder...


so she'd know
she always had a choice.



[Ben coughing]

[coughing continues]


Ah.

Ah.

Let me help you.


Okay.


[labored breathing]

She was a hell of a girl,
wasn't she?

Yes, she was.

[piano music playing]

want me to wait?


So what is this?

That's the greatest
Italian restaurant you've
ever been to in your life.

this hankering...

for their chicken cacciatore.

I love chicken cacciatore.

Yeah. Me too.

Look, I'll catch a cab.

-I'll be fine.
-Okay.

Are we gonna be all right, kid?

Salt and pepper.

Bread and butter.

Your kids need you, Chris.



You sure you don't want
me to wait? I don't mind.

-No, I'll catch a cab.
I'll be fine.
-Okay. All right.

and I was fine.

-Get out of the car.
-I'm still fine...

-Get out of the car.
-[Max] What?

Get out of the car.

-[Max] get out of the car?
-Yeah.

Oh, okay.


[phone ringing]

[phone vibrating]

-[Annie] Hello?
-[Max]  Hello, Annie.

-It's, Max.
-[Annie] Max?

Is everything okay?

Everything's perfect.


[switch clicks]


me your best promise, Annie.

Are you out somewhere?


What?

I want you to go to
Chicago to be with Scott.

a wonderful person.

So much love to give.

Sharing that love...

That's the most
important thing.


More important than dreams.

It's more important
than anything.


I understand.

And I always will.

You're going to have
a beautiful life, honey.


I love you.

I love you too.

Goodbye, cookie-face.

Goodbye, Gramps.

â™ª Remember days

â™ª Remember nights

â™ª When all we ever needed was

â™ª Each other

â™ª With looks reserved
For one another

â™ª Time wore a smile

â™ª And all the while

â™ª We lived, we loved

â™ª We asked ourselves how could
Our days ever end

â™ª We thought that we
Had our life always

â™ª To spend

â™ª We danced, we dreamed

â™ª How sweet it seemed

â™ª Remember then

â™ª When in each others
Arms we heard the music

â™ª We loved the sound

â™ª We heard the song

â™ª Of distant chimes

â™ª Other times

â™ª They seemed to say

â™ª If ever you should leave me

â™ª For a moment

â™ª As if you would

â™ª As if you could

â™ª I'd smile and whisper,
Darling

â™ª Hurry home

â™ª Hurry home â™ª

[instrumental music playing]

â™ª We danced, we dreamed

â™ª Of distant chimes

â™ª Other times

â™ª They seemed to say

â™ª If ever you should leave me

â™ª For a moment
