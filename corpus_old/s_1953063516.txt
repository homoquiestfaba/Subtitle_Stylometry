Benedict!

Is it true?

They've found the boy?

Yes.

It's not safe here.
Nonsense! this is a fortress.

The full resources of the order
are at our the disposal.

Respectfully, Benedict...

The Devil himself wants this child.

There is only one place that is safe.....
that is The Sanctuary.

<i>The Rider must take him.</i>

You do enjoy your wine Moreau

If in few days the winter solstice will be pass
and with it the hour of the prophecy.

And the boy would be
no use to the anyone.

By that time, Brother...

You will all be dead.

This conversation is finished.

Nadya....

I can help you.

Danny, I can protect you.....

Where are they?

Shut up!

Perfect.

Who is this guy?

Stupid ass.

Get down.

<i>It doesn't matter how far you run.</i>

<i>There are some demons, you just can't escape.</i>

<i>My name is Johnny Blaze.</i>

<i>I used to ride motorcycle
for a living.</i>

<i>I did a bare ass '360 triple back flip'
in front of twenty two thousand people.</i>

<i>It's kind of funny,
it's on Youtube check it out.</i>

<i>But when my dad got sick,
I did something way crazier then that.</i>

GHOST RIDER
<font color="#FF3300">Spirit Of Vengeance</font>

<i>You look like you could use a little help.</i>

<i>Are you willing to make a deal?
John...</i>

<i>Atta boy.</i>

Do it! Save his life.
Do it!

<i>Yeah, that is right.</i>

<i>I am the guy who made the deal with the devil.</i>

<i>I know what you're thinking?</i>

<i>Doesn’t this kid watch movies?
Does this ever workout for anyone?</i>

<i>Let's just say good judgment
was not exactly my 'Forte'.</i>

<i>I was possessed by an ancient demon.</i>

<i>In the presence of evil.
I change, into a monster.</i>

<i>And I prey on the wicked....</i>

<i>And ...I suck out their soul's.</i>

<i>You don't wanna be around
when that happens.</i>

<i>See, there's good and bad in all of us.</i>

<i>May be I am not a murderer.</i>

<i>But you did something.</i>

<i>You wouldn't want the ragged to see.</i>

<i>A white lie.</i>

<i>An illegal download.</i>

<i>What about you?</i>

<i>And you?</i>

<i>After I defied it..
to hold it back.</i>

<i>But the darkness inside me...</i>

<i>Only get's stronger.</i>

<i>That's why I had to run.</i>

<i>Half way across the world.</i>

<i>And I am still running....</i>

Who are you?

My name is Moreau.

My brother are dead as should I be.

If not for the intervention of God.

And you are Johnny Blaze.

Go away.

I can't do that.

Uh huh...

It likes the dark places.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

You are a rider.

The ghost says you could control it.

Make it work for you, huh?

That you...

Was stronger then
this deep hungry thing.

This sickness.

Why are you here?

What do you want from me?

I need your help.

And you need your soul.

So we make a deal.

You know about making deals,
don't you Johnny.

Nice bike.

This child..

He is in danger.

And for more than his life.

will save him.

I don't.....

Thousands of miles from your place of birth.

And your dark rebirth.

You were brought here.

For this.

This little kid.

What makes you think I can find him?

This men that you met
years ago, that put the curse on you.

Roarke.

The devil has many names.

He is the link the connects you to this child.

Let the rider follow his stench
and will lead you to the boy.

You said something about a deal.

The church of my masters,

Is in ancient one.

We are prepared to give to you.

The one thing you want most of this world.

Take a piss.

Carrigan.

I got your package but the cost of
doing business with me just went up.

I don't understand.

What's not so understand?

I want more.

You understand that?

We had an agreement carrigan.

Changing the defines term
of agreement is something we just don't do.

You told me to get a kid.

Not a problem.

I've done that for people before.

And I have a history
with his bitch of a mom.

So there's no better guy for the job.

But what you didn’t tell me?
Is that I be walking into middle goddamn horror movie!

How this is funny to you?

Three of my guy's get turned into match stick last night.

By a dude on the motorcycle....
with his head on fire.

Come again.
You heard me.

I've seen thing's, weird thing's, bad thing's.

But that thing last night.

No... no... no..... no.

Put the boy on the phone.

Talk.

Talk.

Danny?

Do you hear me?

I want you to listen very closely.
listen to me danny...

What the hell was that?

Think of the child was sort of computer.

You know computers, right?

I just upload it a little program.

A Firewall.

Our friend on the motorcycle won't be able to
sense him now..to track him.

Of course.

He is still maybe able to find you.
so......

I suggest to you keep moving.

Hello.

Who sent you to find me?

Is it the Devil?

The Devil walk's among man?

Does the Devil?
Own you answer me.

The kid.

Danny.

He is you're son?

Bullets can't hurt you anymore
Could the Demon?

But,I'm think they've gonna do!

Tell me why I can trust you.

You can't!

But if I, don't find your son?

I just assumed he'd be dead.

So if you wanna pull that trigger.

Do it.

Please.

You tracked us last night.

Can you do it again?

I could feel him before.

I could sense him, and then
nothing.

No no.He is not dead.
he is just....

Blocked.

But you know something.

Let's go.

Yeah okay, let me just get something straight....
The guy who kidnapped danny....

And try to kill you.....
blew me up.

With grenades.

You two were like boyfriend and girlfriend?

Carrigan was a gunrunner...
a drug dealer and a mercenary.....

I didn’t care about any of that.....
I just searched to get out.

Right ok!
so danny.... is.

Danny what?
Is he was Carrigan's son?

No.

When you met the seducer?

He offered you something?
yeah!..

My father's life.

Shocker.
He lied.

For me....
It was only myself.

It was supposed to be big scoff in Carrigan, but he want bad.....

I made it out of third floor in a rental.

I was choking on my own blood.

I knew!
I was gonna die.

I could feel it.

And that's when he found me....

<i>You look like you could use a little help?</i>

Roarke.

He promise to take the pain away.

To save my life.

But he ask for something in return.

Your son?

Maybe you can never understand.

No.....
I get it.

You are the Devil's baby mama.

I guess that explains why? Moreau wants....

Danny.
So bad.

Moreau?

Yeah...... Black, French, Alcoholic-
Priest, he's kind of a Dick. Why? you know him?

He tried to help us I didn’t let him.

We were both gonna work on our decision making.

Where are you headed?

Someone, I know.

He does Carrigan's dirty book.
He'll know where to find him.

Why does the Devil walk
on earth in human form anyway?

I have no idea.

Maybe he doesn’t know either.

Maybe he's just.....
Passes on from body to body.

Down through history...

Waiting for the perfect fit.

But! I know one thing.....

on earth.

He's weak.

His powers are limited.

He need's innocent emissaries.

To do his dirty work.

So he find's them or make's them.

Using his greatest power.....

The power of....

The Deal.

Can I open a window?

Do you think you can just talk?

You know, your mom thought she could just talk.

Until, I get doing your gypsy face.

Carrigan get me out of here.

Enjoy yourself in the twinkies cell.

Get me out of here.

Boss.

Come here.

You try that again....
you will return.....

What?

You speak English?

Yeah! Dude! what happened?

Is that your Van?

Ohh! Yeah.

Is it in run?
Yeah.

When we get over...
go ahead.

The Rider's going to come out.

When he does.

He'll destroy whoever got it coming.

Nadya.....

This thing......

There is no reason....

Of conscious.

Just hunger.

And in his eye's.

You're not different than Carrigan?

You are not different than any of them.

I'm not afraid of you.

Yeah?

Maybe, you should be.

That's the guy?

Look's like he work's on a crew ship.

Am I gonna regret taking you?

Um...

Yeah. Probably.

Count every dollar.

I don't want these idiots robbing me.

Everyone's robbing me!

Hello, vasil.

Long time Nadya You look good.

Shut up just shut up.

He's been talking to Carrigan.
last couple of day's and few hour's ago.

John.

You talked to Carrigan?

I've talked with lot of people.

Hey, i've got what your need for your shake's my friend?

Carrigan must told you about that thing?

Yeah!

That thing is inside of me.

See you are bad man.

And this thing, The Rider he feeds
on them and he is hungry!

He's hunger thats been year's
and that's why I am shaking.

Cause right now.. the only thing that's standing
between you and the rider is me.

He is just...

He is creeping at the door.
He's creeping at the door.

Who might if you don’t tell me what I wanna to know.

I am gonna let him out.

I want to stand with you.

You won't be anything left!
Do you understand?

Do you understand?
Shake your head yes or no?

Good.

Where is Carrigan?

Oh! Yeah all right. That's a good answer.

Good girl!
John.

FGM 148 Javelin.

Lock on fire and forget.

American Bunker buster.

Two stage detonation.

The first's creates super vacuum.

It's suck's the oxygen from the air.

How many men you go up against?

Just one.

Danny.

Mom.

Are you ok?

That's weird.

Where's my mom?

She is gassing up the truck.

Little awkward.

I mean, after everything.

Dude, you way cooler than the guys
she usually hang's up.

Huh!

Hey!

So, what's next?

Ugh! Moreau seems to think
the danger pass in a few day's..

And if we just get Danny in someplace safe.

A Holy place where's people can protect us,
where we can ride it out.

That's where we are headed.

Ok.

I've already contacted with Moreau
He's gonna catch up with us on the road.

We gotta move fast.

Cause the one that's hunting us.

They are not done.

Of course I have some personal issue's
I kinda like to get fixed.

Your not done...
Carrigan.

You are the bring me Nadya's son.

I do expect you to fulfill your obligation.

S.... S....S......
sorry, jackass.

But I am dead

Inconvenient.

What you do to me?

Gave you a second chance.

You a little less than alive, now.

But also more!

See..

I've giving you the power.

The power of decay.

Of darkness.

I want that boy Carrigan.

Now you've got no excuses.

The machine last night.

Yeah.
You made it change.

Thats how it works.
Whatever he rides changes with him.

But, what if you took the taxi?

Ugh..

I don't know!
I don't know.

Or a Rollercoaster or ski lift or..

Dude.

Hey! What if you have to pee
when you're on fire?

Oh, it's awesome.

It's like a Flame thrower.
You know, It's like..

When you change..

When you're him-

Does it feel good?

Sometimes.

What does that mean?

All you just bad?

No.

This power that we have,

comes from the dark place.

But it's not who we are.

and never will be...

And we can use it to do good.

To help people.

Like I am helping you and your mom.

I know why are you helping us.

She say's you wanna get rid of it.

I can't never do that.

Blazer!

Hey Nadya.....

I hope you have finished
shooting at me.

Hey!

You wanna have some fun?

You gotta hang on.

That's so weird.

So, this is it.
Moreau's happy place.

I mean this guy's gonna lift my curse.

They donn't even have shoes.

Sunger.

You mustn't be afraid.

It was God that
let you here.

What's up?

I know.

A little to uptight.

But, not so bad
when you get to know them.

Go on.

They will take good care of you.

What about you two?

Oh, We will join you later.

We have some business to complete between us.

I made promise to you, John.

Why can't he come with us?

No.

Danny.
Danny.

You're safe here.

We made it.

The only thing that can hurt you
and your mom now...

is me.

I need to make sure that will never happen.

It will be alright.

I promise.

Whatever.
Come on.

Are you sure about this?

Come on.

Where are we going?

To my favorite woman.

If there's one thing this sons of bitch's know, huh.

It's wine.

This bottle was fetch fifty thousand Euro's at an auction.

Moreau.
Oh.Yeah.

What is it?

It's........
It's thing inside of me.

I would like to know before we..

commence.

Zarathos,

was an angel.

A Spirit of justice.

Sent to protect the world of men.

But....

He was tricked....

captured.

Brought down to hell.

Corrupted.

Driven insane.

His mission to protect the innocent was
perverted into a lust of punish.

The Guilty, he became

The spirit of vengeance.

But the angel?

Spirit justice.

He's alive in there,

Somewhere.

It could be.

Do you feel him?

No.

Cheer up my man.

Soon you will be free.

This bottle....

This one......
is over two thousand years old.

I've had my eye on it for while.

When this is over....

We will share it too.

There is something else.

This thing that, work done to you
is not easily undone.

You risk of death.

Worse than that.

You must confess,

the one thing...
that is most difficult for you to talk about.

My dad..

I didn’t do it for him.

I made the deal from me.

I couldn’t let him go.

I was selfish.

He was ready to die.

He knew it was HIS time.

And I thought, I could change that.

I'm sorry.

This is the lamb of God.

That take's away all the sin from the world.

<i>Happy are those that are called to receive him.</i>

Would you say that,
you're not worthy to receive him?

I am not.

Ok. That's, that's good enough.

The body of Christ.

Amen.

Been carrying this bread around for while?

May God..

lead you into the eternal life.

That is John, if today is in fact-
your last.

Where you go now...

I can not follow.

Are you ready?

Hello.

Hello.

Make it quick,
you assholes!

Make the deal.

Moraeu.

Moraeu.

Moraeu.

Moraeu.

You did it.

Moraeu.

Moraeu.

It worked.

Hey!

What are you doing?

Let me go.

What are you doing?

What will be done.

The day of Prophecy is tomorrow.

You are to hold the boy
until the danger passes.

The danger will not pass, Moraeu.

As long as the boy exists.

The power will
always be inside him.

You lied to me.

You lied to me!

This child must be destroyed.

You might have protested while the child was been conceived.

Now, It is too late.

Take them away
until the thing is done.

Danny's soul can still be saved.

That boy..

is one of the God's children.

No.

He is not.

Pretty neat, huh?

Peace... brother.

Damn.

Bet you're happy to see me.

Did Danny do this?

No.

Somebody got here, before they could....
Before they could kill him.

There's no sign of him.

Whoever did this, wanted him alive.

I think we all have pretty good idea!
who had would be, Moraeu.

Yes, now he is with Roarke.

Some protector
you've turned out to be.

What exactly does Roarke
have in mind for the enemy!

What are his plans...
Is he putting money away for college or what?

It is the day of prophecy.

As was the day, Danny was conceived.

The child must be in his 13th year's before the rite
can be performed on the dawn of a new winter.

The Rite.

Roarke favor the boy as a vessel,
As a content of for his power.

The ritual will transform his...

essence.

His soul into the boy.

There will be no more Danny.

Only Roarke.
No.

Why the hell didn’t you tell us this, Moraeu?

You're the one that made a deal with Roarke.

Both of you.

Something, I would never do.

Alright, the prophecy.
You said, It had to happen at the dawn of a new day.

Well that's good.

Maybe there's still time.
Do you know where Roarke has him?

So what, now you want to play hero?

You got that you wanted.

Yes, I did.

Thank you, for holding up your end of the bargain.

You're welcome.

If I could spend the last day of my life as free man
without the curse hell hanging from my head.

Yeah, I will take that.

But, I promised Danny he'd be safe.

If I walk away now,
I'm just 'pretty one Demon for another'.

So, let's go.

Was there really doubt?
Don't touch me.

Cutting it a bit close, aren’t we?

Do you have any idea..

what I had to go thorough?

To get this little turd.

Look, the players don't align for your little
Pagan party until daybreak tomorrow.

So, get off my ass,
cause I'd said I'm ahead schedule.

Danny?

Do you know who I am?

Well....

I'm sure your mother told you a lot of thing's about me.

What's the matter with your face?

Uzak Gökten,
The furthest point from heaven.

That is where the ritual is to take place.

According to the prophecy, of course.

Of course.

Without The Rider..
We stand little chance against Roarke.

I thought, you're supposed to have faith?
I do.

But also, I think we should have weapon's.

Gun's...

and wine.

Naughty Priest.

I'm starting to like you again Moraeu.

You wanted to know,
why I look this way?

Think of the...

Flame thrower.

Is that funny?

Ok.

A Flame thrower made out of the paper Mache.

All that power.

Try to use it, you burn up.

This body, I'm living in,
Its weak.

Human.

It's dying.

It was never made to do the thing's
that I can do.

But you...

You're only part human.

You will have all the power
that I have inside of you.

Like Father Like Son.

But this corporial form...

Can wield the power,
without burning itself up.

To help you relax.

That will keep him sedated until the ceremony.

Who are they?

Politicians, Murderers,
People of influence.

the Devil's soldiers.

They've traveled from all over the world,
to witness of the annointing of The New king.

Oh...

The New King.

Please.

If Roarke succeeds,

we'll have a new form
One more powerful than is ever known,

And His shadow will fall upon the earth.

25-39..More inside.

The ritual has already begun.

Danny's soul be lost forever at the break of dawn.

This is when Roarke is at his weakest.

Nadya?

You alright?

I've made a lot of mistakes Blaze.

But..Danny...

Danny is the one....

The one good thing...

I ever did.

That being the case, we..

had better make sure he doesn’t
turn out to be the anti-christ.

Not much time?
What's the plan?

I need you go and grab the boy,
you run and you don't stop.

What about you?

Me?

I'm going for the front.

Okay.

Not bad.

This is my big honor.

Johnny Blaze.

Bona me

Go.

Bonjour.

Catch this one, huh.

What a waste of good wine.

Merde!

That felt good.

Okay, you listen to me?

We should've never of gone rid of the power,
I know that now.

He is gonna erase you Danny.

Moraeu.

I can still see the light.

That's gross.

You have no power Blaze!

You're nothing but an insect.

Like the rest.

Food for the meals of hell.

Oh, you wanna watch?

The apple doesn’t rot far from the tree.

Danny.

This is not who you are.

It never will be.

My powers and yours are the same.

That's what you said.

Right.

Dad?

Like Father, Like Son.

Do it.

No.

Come here.

I was never afraid of you.

Road kill.

You are the worst fucking deal,
I ever made.

Go home.

Danny.

The Angel.

Moraeu says, The Rider was an Angel.

That went crazy.

I can feel him.

The Angel.

I can feel him.

Danny.

Danny.

Did we win?

I'm gonna say yes.

Hell... yes.

<i>My name is Johnny Blaze.</i>

I AM THE GHOST RIDER.
