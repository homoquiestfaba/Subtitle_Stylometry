NARRATOR:
 I'm sure you've all heard 
 fairy tales like this before.

Once upon a time, there was 
 a master vampire named Ash

who ruled the clan of 
 the vampires in Eastern Europe.


So, Clair?
Yes?

Please accept this small token
of my admiration.

It's beautiful.

Thank you.

His name is Monsieur Ash.

He's a wealthy patron
of the arts.

A bit eccentric, perhaps.

A most gentle man.

He was quite taken
by your performance

and wishes to engage you in
a private recital at Club Mews.

[PIANO PLAYING]

Don't leave me, Sylvia.

Love goddess of music.


I can make you immortal.

[***]

During his long life, 
 Ash made lots of enemies.

One of those enemies 
 finally caught up with him

for some royal payback.

ZACHARY:
 Before me were 
 the spawn of Ash,

co-mingling with mortals.

To purge this den 
 would be a bloody nightmare.

You are a stranger
to my city.

You have stood between me
and my prey.

What is your name?

Zachary.

NARRATOR:
 But by that time, 
 Ash's evil bloodline

had already 
 spread across the seas.

One of his protÃ©gÃ© 
 made her way to the States,

seeking to become 
 master of a local inn.

Too bad this is no fairy tale.

 I want to feel the pain *

 I want to feel the rain *

What's wrong?

I don't know--
Come on, no, you promised.

Don't chicken out on me
now.

I know, but--
Oh, look, look, look.

Look, it's not as sleazy
as you think, I promise.

* I want to hear 
 Your laughter... *

Come on,
after that dinner I bought you?

Plus I paid
the cover charge.

You're not gonna make me
eat that too, are you?

Oh, baby.

Come on,
it's gonna be okay.

Come on.

Come on, come on, come,
it's gonna be good.

All right, gentlemen, take
your hands out of your pants

and put 'em together
for Cashmere.

And remember to show
your appreciation.

Tipping is not a country
in China.

Ow. Heh-heh.
Thank you very much.

I will be here all night.

Ah, come on, Bruce,
let's go home.

Come on.

[DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING
OVER PA]

She is hot.

And remember, men,
the more green they see,

the more pink you see.

Bruce, I mean it,
let's go.

All those guys
are looking at me.

That's because they're all
a bunch of losers.

They wish they had a girlfriend
as cool as you.

That's not true.
Have a drink. Come on. Drink up.

Okay, and then we go.
Fine.

I hope not.

Hey, sit down.

Spyce.

With a Y.

Spyce.
Hey. Yeah, right.

I'm Bruce,
this here is Tami.

Hi, there, Tami.

Hi, uh--

Oh, she--
She's a little shy.

It's her first time.

Mm, a virgin.

Hey, how much
for a lap dance?

You know what?
This one's on the house.

Baby, come on, relax.
It's gonna be okay.

[DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING

* I want to feel the sunshine 
 I want to feel the rain *

 I want to feel your pain *

Ho-ho. Holy shit.

That was incredible.

Man, I'm gonna
need a towel.

Please, baby,
you gotta do another one.

I can do better than that.

[***]

[DOOR CLOSES]

SPYCE:
Now, go down the hall,
second door on your left.

Mm, make yourselves at home.
I'll be back.

[BRUCE SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]

TAMI: I don't know about this.
BRUCE: Are you kidding?

Come on, baby, set free.
Come on.

[***]


This is creepy.

Are you kidding me?

This is so cool.

Why don't you
get undressed?

The strip club was one thing--
Oh, no, no, no.

--but this...
Oh, no, no, no. You promised.

Come on, you promised.

Remember in the strip club?

You said you weren't gonna
like the lap dance, right?

You did, didn't you?
Well, I know...

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

It'll be just like that
only way better.

I don't think so.

Oh, come on,
consider it a birthday present.

Your birthday's
in November.

Oh, c-- Look, consider it
an early birthday present.

Look,
if you do this for me,

I will never, ever,
ever, ever

ask for anything
ever again.

Cross my heart
and hope to die.

I hope the two of you
are thirsty.

I know I am.

[***]

Come on, baby,
it's gonna be okay. Don't worry.

I didn't hear you come in.

I didn't know
you were home.

I see.

So you weren't planning
on introducing me

to your friends?

You know how rude
I think that is.

I'm sorry.

Maybe
you'd like to join us.

How generous of you.

That is,
if you don't mind.

Are you kidding,
mind?

Thank you, God.

[***]


Don't thank him yet,
sweetheart.



[***]






Hi. I see
you've met Marvin.


[TAMI WHIMPERING]

[TAMI GAGGING]


My,
but she was a tasty one.


Oh.

I'm almost there, Marvin.

Only three to go.

After all these years,

only three.

Very well.

Ow!

You fool!

I've told you before
to watch your teeth.

Pathetic wretch.

Is there a problem?

SPYCE:
You finished her off.

Take her out
to the incinerator.

Where's your sister?
Why isn't she home yet?

She said she was working
till close tonight.

[***]

[WOMAN MOANING]


Why do you have
to take off?

I just do.

Gotta go
to your sister's place?

Come on,
Spyce isn't so bad.

Besides,
I just told you,

we're not really sisters.

We're just...close.

I bet.

Not like that, perv.

We've know each other
a long time, is all.

She's always
been bitchy to me.

She's bitchy
with everybody.

Maybe if she got
to know me,

she wouldn't
be like that?

I could come over
to your place

and we could all
hang out together.

No.

I told you, you can't ever
come to my house.

Whatever.

It won't be long now.

You won't have to live
above the club anymore.

We'll have our own place.

I almost have
enough money saved.

But, Sugar,
I just don't want us--

Shh!

I gotta go.

[DOOR OPENS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

[***]

WOMAN:
 There is no need 
 to sneak around.

[***]

Where have you been?

Working late.

Come closer, dear.

Is that mortal I smell on you?

No, I was--
Don't lie to me, girl.

And what if it is?

You know I've expressly
forbidden relationships

with humans.

But you never said why.

Because they aren't like us.

I know you've only been of
the blood for less than a year

but you've got to learn.

But it feels so right.

Forget feeling. Forget emotion.

You must never see him again.

Not in that way.

You may think
I'm being unjustly harsh

but you've got to trust me.

He will grow old and useless

and you will not.

You will remain young forever.

Stay away from him.

What have I done wrong?

Why am I being punished?

My dear,

I'm not punishing you.

I'm protecting you.

I was once in love like you.

With a mortal?

He was handsome and kind.

But he couldn't control
his impulsive desires.

I found him in the arms
of another.

It was then I revealed
to him my true lineage.

I sent his whore to hell,
quenched on her soiled blood.

And what did you do with him?

Hm.

For him I fashioned
an appropriate retribution.

One fitting of the sniveling
little whelp he was.

And I vowed never again to
be subservient to mortal man

in body or matters of the heart.


Sounds like Marvin's hungry.

His cage needs to be cleaned.

Let him sit in his own filth

till he learns to behave.

I'll clean it if you'd like.

Thank you, dear.

You might even enjoy it.

[***]

[***]

[***]

[***]

I'll do the ravaging
if you don't mind.

[***]

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

What the hell?

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

We're closed.

MAN:
I'd like to speak
to someone in charge.

Come back tomorrow.

MAN:
I'm investigating a murder.

[DOOR OPENS]

Lots of murderers, actually.

You a cop?

Nope.

Then you need to leave.

Oh, but I said the magic word.

Magic word?

Murder.

[***]

Seen these girls?

[***]

No.
Oh.

Nice poker face.
Let me know when you've got

a game together I'll take
some dough off your hands.

What do you want with them?
So you have seen them.

Did something happen to them?

They weren't involved
in the murder

if that's
what you're worried about.

But they're
not exactly alive either.

What the hell
are you talking about?

[***]

You do know what a vampire is,
don't you?


I know what a nut job is too.

I should call the police
so they can take you back

to your padded room.

Hey, why don't you hear me out?

A little story's
not going to kill you.

Last year I caught wind
of a couple of dancers

out of Phoenix.

Sort of a naughty and nice pair.

They lured men from the club.

Most of whom
subsequently disappeared

under mysterious circumstances.

What do you mean most
of them disappeared?

Well, the cops found one,

comic book collector in town
for a convention.

Drained of his blood.

Poor kid probably thought
he was going to get laid.

Instead he got laid out.

But his death kept me
on the trail.

I've been scoping out L.A.
for the past three months

looking for
this naughty and nice

or whatever
they call themselves.

And I suppose you're some sort
of vampire hunter. Is that it?

Yeah.

Here's who I'm really after.

[***]

Chasing her ever since
I was a kid

because of what she did
to my father.

Did she drain his blood too

or just turned him
into one of them?

Does your daddy turn
into a bat at night?

Give me a break.

They don't all turn into bats,
you know.

Vampires are just
like any other animals

spawn by different strains,

bloodlines, breeds.

This particular breed

believes when they kill someone

the first spray
of arterial blood

contains the victims soul.

They call it the primal blood.

That's what keeps them young,
gives them strength.

The rest of the blood
is just food.

And this one you're looking for.

She's the master.

Broken off from a bloodline
in Eastern Europe.

It's a long,
dark fairytale, kid.

A little too much for you.

Anyway, rumor has it

that if one of these vampires
feast on the primal blood

of 10,000 victims

10,000 souls

they will possess the power
over all vampires.

Maybe even become invincible.

Ten thousand?


That's impossible.

Not really.

A hundred a year

for a hundred years.

A vampire could stay alive
that long.

They could do it.

And this one that's around--

And I know she is.

--she's close.

Damn close.

The other girls
are just her protÃ©gÃ©s

but no less dangerous.

Those girls work here
but they're not vampires.

I can tell you that.

And how do you know that?

Look around.

You see all the mirrors?

Vampires don't have reflections.

That's just a lot
of movie horseshit, kid.

All vampires can see
their reflections in the mirror.

Their vanity would drive
them crazy if they couldn't.

[***]


Okay.

You are Stud Boy.

You can do this.

You can do this.

Okay.

Everything's perfect.

Bed--


Breath.


All right.

[CLEARS THROAT]

Hello.

You must be Dark Lady.

I'm Lester.

Stud Boy.

Stud Boy.

You can do this Lester.
Come on.

Calm down.


Okay. All right.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Uh-- Uh-- Be there in a minute.

Okay.

[***]

Oh, hi.

You must be, uh, Dark Lady.

Hi, there.

Nice to meet you.

Well, you're certainly
not what I expected,

Stud Boy.

Yeah, well, um,
I can explain that.

See, I-- I might have
exaggerated a little bit

on my online profile but--

I wouldn't consider
it false advertising.

Save it.

I don't care about looks.

You don't?

No. It is what's on
the inside that counts.

I can't tell you how refreshing
it is to hear that.

Most of the women I meet seem
so superficial.

There are a lot of shallow
people out there, Stud Boy.

Call me Lester.

Lester.
I-- I mean--

Some of the women I've--
Women I've dated I--

You should hear the horrible
things they've said.

Right to my face even.
If you believe--

Terrible.

See that's--
That's why I'm so glad I've--

I found a woman like you who can

appreciate me for a--

For who I am.

I always appreciate
a good meal, Lester.

What?

[LESTER GRUNTS]

[***]

Let me show you a little trick
I've learned.

Vampires leave traces of
themselves on all their victims.

Sort of like DNA,
but not exactly.

I broke into the Phoenix morgue

and took this cross
and what was left

of the comic geek's blood.

Now it acts like a divining rod

and points out the bloodline
when I get close.

That's interesting.

Well, I hate
to break it to you, Romeo

I think your
little Juliette's a vampire.

If she's a blood sucker,
why hasn't she killed me?

Because she loves you,
you moron.

Consider yourself lucky.

Take my advice.

Break up with her gently.

I still say you're nuts.

Oh, yeah?

Well, let me guess.

You never hook up
with her during the day.

You've never been invited
to her house.

You rarely see her eat.

Her favorite booze
is red wine, right?


Oh, cute.

Vampire with a driver's license.

Sugar.

What's the other ones name?

Spyce.

Nice.

Well, maybe she hasn't learned
to keep herself hidden.

What do you mean?

Let's see
if this address is real.

[***]

[***]

Thanks, Lester.

You really know how
to satisfy a woman.

[***]

Morella.

What brings you here?

What do you think you're doing?

Just having
a little midnight snack.

You took his primal blood.

Yeah. So what?

He's my victim, not yours.

Who says you get first dibs
on everything?

What gives you the right?

I have every right.

I'm your master.

Oh, master.

I'm so scared.

Wait. Do you hear that sound?

What sound?

My teeth chattering.

You insolent little brat.

You better learn some respect.

I only have three more

and then I become invincible.

Queen of the bloodline.

It would behoove you
to stay in my good graces.

Behoove?

What the hell kind
of a word is that?

I've had just about enough
of your attitude, young lady.

No, I don't take that
from anyone,

certainly not
from those under me.

Maybe I don't want
to be your slave.


You see?
You can't beat me.

So to pay for your little act
of defiance

you're going to go out
and find me another victim.

A fresh victim.

And bring him home
to the mansion for me.

Is that understood?

Is that understood?

Yes.

Very good.

And you will continue
to serve me for all eternity

if it is my wish.

And you will enjoy
every single moment of it

you sadistic little bitch.


[***]

[***]

Oh. Hey, Marvin,
what have you been eating?

You have to stay away
from those fatty foods.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

Oh.

Oh.

Oh, my God, Dex.
What are you doing here?

I got the address
from your driver's license.

Dex, you've got to leave.

I've just got
one question for you.

It's going to sound weird, but--

So it is true.

I'm sorry.

I was going to tell you.
How come I've never seen

the fangs before?

I only get them when I'm hungry.

I'd never hurt you.

But someone else would.

Who?

Spyce?

MORELLA: Sugar?
Go.

I'll tell you
everything tomorrow. I promise.

Satisfied?

I can't believe
she's really one of them.

Get over it, kid.

Find yourself a nice girl
who doesn't mind the sunlight.

See any others in there?

No. But one was coming
in the back.

It wasn't Spyce.

Morella.

The one I'm after.

What are you going to do?

What needs to be done.

You're not going
to hurt Sugar, are you?

She won't suffer.

I'm telling you she's not evil.

Look, kid, you've got
to get over this.

You're going to make
the same mistake my father did.

Where do you think you're going?

I'm going in there to get her
and you're not going to stop me.

Okay. But you can't go in
like that.

They can smell a mortal
a mile away.

Jesus. I thought vampires
hated garlic.

They do.

But this bloodline
can't smell it.

It will mask you scent.

But only for about 10 minutes.

By then you've got
to be out of there.

And kid--

Stay out of my way in there.

[***]

This way.

[***]

Sugar.

Dex.

In here.

What are you doing here?

Get your things.
I'm getting you out of here.

What are you talking about?
There's somebody with me.

He's here to kill Morella,
he'll kill you too

unless I get you out of here.

Oh, Dex,
nobody can kill Morella.

Maybe, maybe not.

But this guy knows his shit.

Come on.

If Morella finds out
I've run away

she'll hunt me down.

Forever if she has too.

I'm am willing to take
the chance if you are.

Give me a minute to pack.

[***]

So now that you've
got me up here

you want to tell me
what kind of job this is?

Hold on, baby.

I see you brought a guest.

How nice.

I see how this is.

You two are into the kinky shit.

Pay me an extra 40 bucks.

But by the looks of this place,

I think you can afford it.

[***]


Hmm.

Off with it.

You guys are into the real kink.

I want another 40 bucks.

That'll be fine.

We'll be in momentarily.

Umm...

I'd like a beer.
Do you have any beer?

Very well.


Not exactly the cream
of society, is she?

What do you want
on short notice?

See if you can find Sugar.

She should be part of this too.

[GRUNTS, GROANS]

Ohhh.


Come on.

Oh.

Where are you going?

Um--

Hey!

Looks like you're planning
on being gone for a while.

I'm sure Morella would love
to hear about this.

Spyce, please don't tell her.

After all the shit
she's given me?

Always thinking
you're little miss perfect.

SPYCE:
Oh, it's gonna be great

watching her give
it to your ass for once.

What's that I smell?

At least give me a head start
before you tell her.

Do you me that favor please.

No, fucking way.

I'm finally on Morella's
good side.

And I'm gonna milk it
for all it's worth.

I'm gonna love this.


What--?
What are you?

Some little fucked up monkey?

Oooh.
Get--

Mmm.

Ew.


WOMAN:
Enough!


You're not supposed
to be out of your cage.

Bad boy.

[CRIES OUT]

Just for that, no dinner
for a week.

Oh.

This shit ends,
I'm calling the cops.

Shut up, you foolish whore.

[CRIES OUT]



Ahh.

A smoker.

My skins going to be parched
for certain.

I'm sorry, girls, I wanted
you to be here to see this.

I'm so close after all.

But this one,
she irritated me.

What's this?

Someone's planning
on a little trip.

My dear, I'm so
disappointed in you.

I don't see what's
so wrong with me,

wanting to be on my own
for a while.

Where is he?

Don't try to fool me, girl.

I knew I smelled him earlier.

Did you dare bring him in here

after I expressly forbade it?

I'll show you what
he's good for.

Don't hurt him. I love him.

Don't you dare leave this room.

You keep an eye on her.

And take that out of here.

How does it feel to be the bad
one for once in your life?

[***]


You can't let her do it, Spyce.

Do what?

Hurt, Dex.
If she gets--

Oh, give it a rest.

There's nothing special
about him.

He's just a human.

Hell, there are billions
of them out there.

There's only one Dex.

God, you're so pathetic.

I can't wait to see
the look on your face

when she tears him open.

You might be waiting
a long time.

Who the hell are you?

The name's Ivan Burrows, honey.

And I've been chasing
you ladies for a long time.

Oh, yeah?

Well, you can catch us
at the meat market,

Thursday through Saturday night.

And all you gotta do
is pay a cover.

I'll stick to my porn
collection.

More bang for my buck.

Besides, you're a little skinny
for my taste.

Well, you got balls,
I'll give you that.

[SPYCE LAUGHS]

You see this, Sugar?

He thinks
he's Van fucking Helsing.

Remember Vicki? Cleveland?

That's right.
With their own.

It's a little before your time.

Sugar, went to sleep
in her coffin one morning,

never woke up.

That was me.

The closest I ever
got to Morella.

Until you guys skipped town

so I couldn't track your nest.

I wondered who that was.

That was a big mistake
on your part.

I liked Vicki.

You're gonna have to do better
than that, shorty.

Okay. Okay, all right.

You win.

I take my hat off to you.

Never send a boy
to do a man's job.



[GROANS, CHOKES]


Spyce.

[BREATHING HEAVILY]

Fe-fi-fo-fum.

I smell the blood of a human.

You fell for the wrong girl.

You're still here, young man,

consider this a warning:

Stay away from Sugar.

If you come near her again,
I'll kill you.

If you're lucky.

You think he'll pull
the stake out?

She suddenly reforms,
and comes to life.

Like in the movies.

Sorry, it doesn't work
like that.

She's done.

She's finished.
She's history.

Don't tell me you're
sorry to see her go.

She was a royal bitch.

But she was my friend.

You know what I think?

I think you have too big
a heart to be a vampire, honey.


That's why it's gonna be so hard
for me to do what I have to do.

You don't have to do it.

You could let me go.

Let you go?

Run off with your boyfriend?

There's no such thing as
romantic endings for vampires.

And I'm really sorry.

I'm sure you were a cute couple.

I promise, I'll make it quick.



[DROPS STAKE]


Dad?

Huh-huh.

Oh.


How did you manage to sneak
in here without my knowing it?

The door was open.

Argh.

Garlic powder?

I haven't seen that trick
since the old country.

Surely you didn't think
of it yourself.

Fuck you.


You didn't really think I'd let
you take Sugar away, did you?

You could never
be faithful to her.

You'd only break her heart.

I would never.

Of course you would.

You're a man.

That's what men do.

I said you'd be lucky
if I killed you.

Perhaps I'll turn you
into an Homunculus instead.

You know what an Homunculus is?

It's a tiny prehistoric human.

Part reptile, like all men:

Slimy, little snakes.


My heart was broken
by a man once many years ago.

The revenge came in the form
of a tiny little vial of blood.

Provided by an ancient witch,

with the blood of a Homunculus.

I tricked my lover
into drinking it.

Perhaps we should
go and meet him.

I can't believe it.


I thought when she turned you,

She-- She killed you.

Uh-uh.

She's been keeping you
in this cage all this time?

Thirty years?

I'll make her pay.

I promise, I'll make her pay.


[LAUGHS, GROANS]

Dex.

Morella,

it's been a long time.

Do I know you?

You may not remember me.

You used to baby-sit me.

Bounce me on your knee.

I'm Ivan.

Ivan.

Well, well.

Look, Marvin, your son's grown
into a fine young man.

Well, not exactly grown.

I think I can still bounce
you on my knee.

Yeah, well, you try it.

I'll send your ass to hell
with Spyce.

Spyce?

No one leaves here tonight.

It's a night
for a dark celebration.

Take a look, my little Ivan.

The marks on this book

represent the primal blood
of all my victims.

No, thanks.

Not my kind of reading.

I'm a Louis L'Amour fan.

Very well.

I wouldn't expect you
to read it anyway.

Certainly not when you have

such a limited amount
of time to live.

There are 9998 marks
in that book.

Hmm, you've been pretty busy
for an old bitch.

Only two more.

Two more
and I become invincible.

Queen of the bloodline.

Blah, blah, blah.

This is nothing to make
a mockery out of, Ivan.

It's a momentous occasion,

historical even.

First you.

Then him.

Don't you see the honor
I'm giving him, child?

To be the 10,000th.

His name will be revered

throughout the bloodline
for ages.

Dex. Dex.

Yes, Dex.

We'll have to do something
about that.

Hardly a name to be worshipped.

So, my little Ivan,

It was so nice to see you again.

But now it's time to bid adieu.

And with your father watching.

How fitting.


Do your worst.


I haven't survived this long
by sheer luck.

[DROPS STAKE]

Certainly I won't be done
in by a simple parlor trick.

What the hell,

I gave it a shot.

Before you do me in

are you gonna give me a
minute

to say goodbye to my father?

You can do that much for me,
can't you?

Why of course I can.

I'm not completely heartless.

Sorry about the way things
turned out, Pop.


Tried my best.

I-- I--


You think it will work?

Huh-huh.

Ahh.

I hope you're right.

All right, you high tall bitch.

Let's get this over with.

Make it quick.

[CRIES OUT]


Bitch.

Tasty little boy
you had there, Marvin.

Only one more to go.


[MARVIN GRUNTS]

What's wrong with me?

[***]


[***]

Listen,
we'll get to Mexico.

We'll take a plane or a ship
to South America.

Somewhere where
she'll never find us.

She'll chase us no matter where.
I don't care.

As long as I'm with you.

Oh, Dex.


Sweet plan.

Only it will be Sugar
and I on that cruise.

Not you, Dex.


[MIRROR BREAKS]

Oh, no.


What's wrong with me?

What's happening to me?


Marvin.


[***]

Is she dead?

She can't be.


Looks like Ivan turned
the tables on her after all.
