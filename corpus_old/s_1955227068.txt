MELISSA: Oh, Ryan.

This night was awesome.

I had fun.

It'd be way more
awesomer, Melissa,

If you showed me your boobies.

Oh, God, your so romantic.

Titties.

Mmm, I love when
you talk dirty.

Boobies.

Mmm.

Breasteseses.

MELISSA: Mmm.

Your male obsession with
breasts is turning me on.

I'm going to show you my boobs.

Close your eyes.

This is going to be sweet.


What was that?

Aw, kinda cute, aren't ya?


Melissa?

Melissa, where'd you go?

Goddamn it.

Can I still see some boob?

Oh, my God.

That is... that is sophomoric.

That is tasteless.

Shit!

Oh, my God!

It's eating my brain!

[Music playing]

THEME SONG: Tonight's
the night mass creatures

Emerge from their dens.

Traveling through dark woods
searching for lives to end.

So beware of the glare of
the bright silver moon.

They're coming.

They're killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They call them killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They're coming.

They're killer raccoons.

MAN (ON RADIO):
Looks like it's going

To be another beautiful
day around here

As summer is certainly
just around the corner

For the people of Independence.

The forecast is calling
for sun, sun, and more sun.

Just a smidgen of clouds
for the next couple of days.

Our high should be in the
upper 80s to the lower 90s.

So from all of us here
at WRZN, all talk radio

All the time, we encourage all
of our listeners to get outside

And please enjoy the
beautiful weather.

And don't forget to
wear your sunscreen.

Oh!

Oh, man.

That is... that is sophomoric.

That's tasteless.

Wow.


What the bumble?


Holy Hendrix!

[Phone ringing]

RICK DANGER: I'm
telling you, Daddy.

Going sober was the best
decision I ever made.

Yep.

No one's going to be laughing
at the name Ranger Rick Danger...

Not this year.

I might even be a
hero someday, Dad.

Just like you.

No, I been hanging out
in the hot tub all day.

Yeah, the mayor's hot tub.

SHANE: Ranger Danger!

Oh, shit.

Daddy, I gotta go.

I love you, too.

Bye.

What's up, Shane?

SHANE: I sent in the
camcorders and also

Set up the security camera.

Now I'm at the front entrance.

Good, good.

I'm almost done here too.

I also found an unusual
amount of rubbish in the woods.

I think the animals are
getting into the trash

And our food and stuff.

RICK DANGER: Yep.

Drunk kids will do that.

No, not drunk kids.

Animals.

Ranger Danger, you're
such as Silly Billy.

[Phone ringing]

Shit snakes.

[Phone ringing]

Daddy?

Danger.

Mr. Mayor?

Where the freak have you been?

I've been calling the
station for five hours.

Oops.

Uh...

Are you in my hot tub?

No.

Shit, no.

MR. MAYOR: Well, you better be
ready for this week, Danger,

Because I spent half our
budget on security equipment

To catch kids drinking
in your woods.

Oh, yeah.

Absolutely.

I'm putting up the
last camera right now.

You need to make some money
off these students, Danger.

That's sort of the
whole point of all this.

This "booze and lose"
program has got to work.

Oh, it... oh, it
will, Mr. Mayor.

I'm on it.

MR. MAYOR: You're
on thin ice, Danger.

People are still ticked
about the drinking arrests

Last year which
you didn't execute.

They think the place
is falling apart.

What's this new taser for?

Bullets are bad
news now, Danger.

Tasers are in.

Gives kids an electric
shock they can't fuck with.

That's enough to
kill an armadillo.

Speaking of which,
how's your AA going?

Oh, fine, fine.

Deputy Shane is teaching me how
to interact with people better.

Lots of singing and
dancing and shit.

MR. MAYOR: Good.

I need you to
swoon over a member

Of the Association
of African-American

Academic Advancement tomorrow.

You mean the AAAAA?

MR. MAYOR: Yeah.

Uh, AAAAA.

He... he can get us funding.

We need funding.

Really?

MR. MAYOR: And I would
certainly recommend

Staying off the sauce, Danger.

Remember, if you booze, you
will also lose... everything.

Okie dokie?

Buh-bye.

All right.

Fine, Mr. Mayor.

DR. BILLINGTON: Danger!

Come in!

This is Dr. Billington.

Shitsnakes.

What is it, doc?

Danger, I need you to report
to the emergency station

Immediately.

Now!

Yeah, all right.

I'll be right there.

Time to go to work.

Well, look who's taking
forever to do something.

What are you doing?

Fireworks, baby.

Beer and explosives
all in one store.

This town rocks.

We don't have
money for fireworks.

We only have money
for beer and food.

Dude, you are such a
virgin, you know that, Ty?

Just have sex once.
Honestly.

Have sex once.

It's awesome.

Right.

Which kind do we want?

Get the regular.

The light tasted bad,
not that you would know.

Zach two, Ty zero.

This is gonna suck.

I told you, we don't sell
explosives to your kind.

Well, can... can
I get a license?

No way, Osama.

You'd probably go blow
up freedom or some shit.

Look, a low-flying aircraft.

In the store?

La-la-la-la!

Lousy goddamn Arab.

Ah, hey.

Can I help ya?

Uh, yeah, I just
need beer here.

OK.

Can I see an ID?

No, actually.

That's OK.

Where you headed?

Raccoon Creek Campground.

Ah, should be fun.

But you might want
to pack some heat.

I hear the little critters
will get into trash and food

Down there.

Here you go.

You guys sell guns here?

Hell, yeah, we do.

Welcome to Independence.


[Screaming, glass shattering]

DR. BILLINGTON: This
morning, two bodies were

Found up on the North hill.

One is, or was, a girl.

This is all that's left
of her... her breasts.

That's sophomoric.

And tasteless.

And the other, he's a boy.

He was found with fecal
matter in his mouth.

It was disgusting.

He's gone into shock.

Well, he has a pulse.

RICK DANGER: Who discovered him?

I found him.

Jeff Tuck, I thought
I told you I didn't

Want you hanging around here.

Danger, man, you got a
problem on your hands.

It's not even hip.

Bitten breasts, poison feces.

I know their marks.

Most diseased-common
common animal in our woods.


The ring-tailed rodent.

The raccoon, man.

The bandit of the night!

I can't believe you
fucked up our fear

Hookup and our fireworks
hookup and our gun hookup.

The city would
still sell us guns.

SHANE: Welcome to Raccoon Creek.

Boys here to camp?

Uh, yeah, this
guy's first time.

Good.

You know how to start a fire?

Rub two di... sticks together?

You should have no
trouble with that, dude.

Stop, stop.

You're turning me on.


I think this dude's gay.

What happened to your shirt?

Bear attack.

Purr!

Raccoons aren't threatening.

They're cute.

Danger, there's more to these
raccoons than you think, man.

It's like Watergate.

Are you going to believe
that crackhead over there?

No.

Clearly that kid got drunk
and tried to eat shit,

And that girl fell
out of a tree.

She was probably drunk, too.

Prepared.

They're sacred killers.

They're working for the spirit
mother and their time has come.

RICK DANGER: Tuck, do
you even have any proof

Of these raccoon attacks?


Yeah, man.

I got proof.

I got... I got proof
out in the woods.

But, I left it out there.

SHANE: Info!

Our students are here.

Yeah!

Yeah!

Woo!

BOY: Goal.

Luke 9:11.

At that time, the kingdom
of heaven will be like this.

Once there was a man f

All right, guys.

It's my big break, so don't
screw it up, all right?

Oh, goddamn it.

This is gonna suck.


Goddamn it, dude.

Hey, what a pussy.

You boys gonna eat this?

It was stuck to your wheel.

That you were saving it.

All righty, you boys
enjoy the words.

Maybe the woods is
gonna enjoy you.

[Creepy laugh]

Goodness!

These backwoods heathens surely
could use some Bible-ing.

Hi, I'm Clayton.

This Is my friend, Greg.

Hi.

Jesus saves.

Are you all right?

Yeah, seriously.

Peace be with you.

Yeah, I'm fine.

[Romantic music]

Hi, I'm Janine.

I'm Christine.

THEME SONG: Hey.

All right, everybody.

Welcome to Raccoon
Creek Campground.

We're excited to have
you all here this week.

We've taken some
special precautions

To make sure everybody is safe.

I'm your head
ranger, Rick Danger.


All right, to get things
started, we got a band.

You all like bands.

Um, here they are,
The Happy Campers.

Ladies and gentlemen of Raccoon
Creek, are you ready to rock?

[Rock music]

Oh.

Hey!

Sorry, sorry.

Kick his ass, Rex!

Yeah, stick it in his ass, man!

You best be sorry, pussy bitch!

Don't mess with Rex or his boys.

Hi, are you a pussy bitch?

No.

No my name's... my name's Ty.

Are you from Thailand?

Uh, um...

That was a joke.

Oh, no, no.

This is actually my
first time camping.

A little old, aren't you?

No, actually my
dad wasn't really

Around for much
dad-son type of stuff.

So there's actually
a lot I haven't done.

Well, there are
some things your dad

Can't be around to teach
you for the first time.

ZANE: Summer break!

Woo!

Let's get wasted.

Woo!

[Music scratches]

RICK DANGER: All
right, nobody move.


It's Ranger... Rick Ranger!

Don't be a stranger
in my manger!

I'm gonna need to
see some ID, son.


I left it at home.

I'm gonna need to see some ID.

OK, um...


All right, everybody.

Party's over.

Get out of here.

Well, I'll see you later, Ty.

Yeah, yeah.

See ya... "latron."

Jeez, man.

That chick totally digs you.

Gotta be a whore.

No way.

She's cool.

[Imitating trumpet]


Danger!

$2,000?

That's fucking weak, man.

Save it, high roller.

The young boy I showed
to you earlier is missing.

Where'd he go?

I... I don't know.

I don't...

RICK DANGER: Don't
you go anywhere.

Hi, Ranger Danger.

TY: "Latron."

I'm fucking stupid.

Where the hell am I?

Goddamn it, Ty.

He was here just a minute ago.

I... Something's fucked up.

[Growling, yelling]

DR. BILLINGTON:
Shoot him, Danger!

Shoot it!


I'm gonna pop your cherry!


Oh, my God!

Ugh.

Fuck, dude.

You scared me into shit.

I knew you'd get lot.

Well, I'd rather be lost
than covered in shit.

Dude, I'm sorry.

That's shitty.

It's all right, man.

I got wet naps in the tent.

Wet naps?

Out of range.

Oh, my God!

No, I'm trapped in this cell!

Ah!

DR. BILLINGTON: What the
hell was with that shit?

RICK DANGER: I did
what I had to do.

DR. BILLINGTON: Danger, I know
you may have saved my life,

But we don't know why.

He was probably drunk.

Drunk?

No, no, no.

We have to get somebody
from the research desk.

What if Tuck was right
about the... the coons?

Tuck was not right.

Look, besides, I
can't let something

Like this get out to the mayor.

I'm sure these unusual
deaths were a one-time thing

And they'll all just blow over.

Shit snakes.

Jesus, what the hell happened?

I don't know, shit breath.

You leave the cooler unlocked,
the animals get your food.

He got the whole camp.

Still some shit over there
if you want to eat that.

I'm Dick Weener live
for Network News.

What was a happy summer
break camping trip

Has now gone terribly wrong,
and a college student, Zane,

Affectionately called
"The Train" is now

Dead because of animal attacks.

What's going on?

Some pussy-ass animal derailed
"The Train" last night.

Hey, it's TV's Dick Weener.

Authorities aren't saying much.

Shane, when you
were calling experts,

Did you happen to
call the media?

Let's see.

I called the CDC, the
ECA, the local church,

Pest control, and the media.

Shit.

Shit snakes, now
the word's out!

DR. BILLINGTON: No, no.

Danger!

I've done some research.

You see?

There is the bacteria that
lives inside the coon's stomach,

And it makes people sick.

What is it?

What it is?

What it is... it's called...

It's called [inaudible].

Raccoon roundworm.

Spread through a coon's scat,
it enters through the mouth.

Burrows in the brain.

Eats away until death.

Right, what... what he said.

My name is Chester
D. Charlesworth.

Your deputy, Shane, told me
to enter through the back.

I'm with the CDC and a
professor at Raccoon University.

That's a real university?

Is that a real mustache?

[Phone ringing]

[Dial tone]

Hey, guys.

I hate to bother
you, but we just

Heard some disturbing news.

They just brought in a raccoon
expert to research the killing.

Raccoons?

Raccoons?

You mean raccoons are
the fags who killed Zane?

Let's get the hell out of here.

[Agreeing in unison]

If some man were to
kill that raccoon,

I'd have sex with them.

I think I'd just
give them a blowjob.


She meant after
marriage, right?

Danger, what has happened?

Rumor around town
is that you have

Something of a critter problem.

Your deputy Shane said I
could enter through the rear.

Howdo, son.

Reverend Pookie.

From Church of
God, Independence.

How do you do?

Ah, shoot, Reverend.

We got a coon problem.

Coons?

They got diseases?

Distemper?

Rabbis?
Rabies.

Rabies?

And it could be something more.

Last night, these raccoons
ate some poor kid.

This ain't disease.

Raccoons eating boys?

You know darn well this
is the work of Satan.

What we need is an
exorcism to get him out.

Led by me, of course.

REX: What... What
the hell do we do?

When my dad goes hunting,
he gets totally ripped!

Well, let's get wasted!

[Rock music]

ALL: Chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug!

I'd like to catch
one of these bastards

And examine them before
we jump to conclusions.

POOKIE: Nonsense.

Danger, just let me
get the old book on it.

Well, either way we're going
to have to come into contact

With the coon, but how?

That's where I come in, fuckers.

You all need a raccoon?

I can get 'em.

My name is Jon, I'm
in PR... pest removal.

Yeah, your deputy told me I
could slip on in from behind

Anytime I want to.

Anyway, I'm here to help.

Well, fine.

Thank you, Mr. Charlesworth,
Reverend Pookie, and Mr. Jones

For coming.

And now, we just got to figure
out what kind of raccoon

We got.
Aw, man.

I'll tell you what it is.

It's the same damn
raccoons that's

Been coming here for 20 years.

They're back.

They're back for revenge!

Who's this?

Tuck, I told you to stay out.

And I told you yesterday,
man, it's a raccoon.

You wouldn't believe me.

I know my shit, dude.

I know these raccoons
better than anyone else

In these woods.

Yeah.

Tuck here bones animals.



These raccoons deserve to die!

REX: Yeah!

Kill the coons!

ALL: Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Danger, you need my
help for this, man.

Look, you old hippy.

What we need from you
is not to fuck this up.

We need to find a way
to get these raccoons.

ALL: Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

The college students.

How in the hell
did they find out?

Oh, I bet it was
the darn media.

Liberal mother fuckers.

If only someone could
talk to the crowd.

If they could sing or
dance or something.

ALL: Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

RICK DANGER: Shane?

Shane?

Shane, are... Shane, can you...

Mmm, fruit.

I love fruit.

ALL: Kill the coons!

Kill the...

I'll have to do it myself.

ALL: Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

My fellow campers.

I hear your cry and I
believe in your cause.

We are victim to
great evil that lurks

Unbeknownst to us in the
woods and right here among us.

Now, these folks that
stand here behind me?

They support your solutions.

We must rid this
camp of raccoons,

And we must do so for Zane!


If these raccoons change
the way we camp, they win.

We must fight!


God has given you a gift.

A gift to spread the word of
the Lord and destroy evil.

What we have here is a good old
fashioned coon hunt for Christ!


Uh, y'all some
great mother fuckers.


Hey, hey, hold on, man.

You guys... you guys can't rid
these coons by hunting them.

There's too damn many of them.


Electric shock you
can't fuck with.

Don't listen to this fool.

You gotta do what's right.

You gotta pick up
your guns and lead

This fearful fight against
the bandits of the night.

Zane, got a little insane

When he tried to hit the sauce.

coons in the name of Zane, then

His life ain't completely lost.

do is kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore!

I think I'm gettin' it.

(DEEP SINGING) I'd have it
made if I were to get laid,

And now is really my chance.

If I kill these coons
and impress Janine,

I'll have some
company in my pants.

he's gotta do is...

ALL (SINGING): Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore!

Night of the
bandits of the night

Of the bandits of the
night of the bandits

Of the night of the bandits!

The fact is coons are
attacking this town.

We must not falter.

We must step it up.

We got to join together in
the spirit of Independence.

Together, we must
kill the coons.

[Music scratching]


ALL (SINGING): Kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore!

(SINGING SLOWLY) Until we
just can't kill anymore.


Hey, kid.

Welcome to the show.

Aren't you happy to
be here today, Muffy?

I sure am, Clumpy.

First thing you all got
to know about hunting... you

Got to be aware of
your surroundings.

You oughta be alert.

Wait, what?

Now that is the position where
you want to hold your gun.

You must be wary of your gun.

You mean these guns?

No.

No, those are your arms.

Aren't these things
technically arms?

Yeah.

Yeah, some people do
refer to them as arms.

You mean these arms?
No.

Now, next thing you all
got to know about hunting

Is you gotta be patient.

There's one.


Jesus Christ, hold your
goddamn horses, people.

Don't worry, kid.

Muffy's going to be just fine.

There's another one.

We're gonna call 9-1-1...



Oh, goddamn!

We're supposed to be
destroying evil here.

My raccoons.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, people.

Can't you see this violence is
poisoning our children's minds?


OK, that's enough target
practice for today.


Dude, did you fart?

I gotta poop.

Yeah, let's go find a pooper.

It's just as I
suspected, gentlemen.

But worse.

This scat from the boy contains
the roundworm, all right.

And the bite marks that created
the rabies and distemper.

It appears that our raccoons
are incredibly diseased.

So what exactly are you saying?

God, I gotta poop.

Gonna have to poop
in the woods, bro.

How do we wipe?

Wipe with your hand.

CHARLESWORTH: Everyone
knows someone who's had

A run-in with an angry raccoon.

There are several
things... adaptable, smart,

And susceptible to disease.

[Farting, laughing]

Oh, man!

They are sneaky and aren't
afraid of human's trash

And waste.

They seem cuddly and
playful at first.


Hey, come on.

Come on, that tickles.

But if a raccoon is diseased,
pray that it doesn't have

Distemper or aggressive rabies.

For those dexterous claws get
on anyone who is vulnerable.


Vicious attacks.

And your raccoons
in particular... I

Don't know how they got
scat in the boy's mouth.

You'd think people
wouldn't eat shit.

Dude, you should really
try pooping over here.

Real nice.

Some people believe
that raccoons

Are even smarter than people.

So can these,
uh, raccoons carry

Sexually transmitted diseases?

Sorry.

Ah, I feel about
10 times lighter.

Damn, bro, what'd you eat?

Jon?


What the hell was that?

I don't know.

Let's go!

Dude, quit being gay.

Ah!

Fag!

Halt!

I got tranquilizers.

Oh, no.

I got bullets.

I have... I got bullets there.

Uh, uh, I'll be in
the ranger station.

What the hell was
wrong with him?

Dude, did he shit in his mouth?

Those are raccoons, man.

The scat of raccoons.

Raccoon scat makes men go batty
if it gets in their mouth.

Dude, you fell in
shit last night.

Oh, my God.

It got in my mouth.

Eww, Ty?

Hold on know, you
fell in by the trail?

Yeah.

Well, that's not
where raccoons poop.

That's where I poop.


[Gunshot, shrieking stops]

Breaking news now
from Raccoon Creek

Campground where the killer
raccoon has been shot dead.

Three out of three
experts have confirmed

That the dead varmint
is the same that killed

A college student last night.

We have captured the
varmint that was supposedly

Injuring some campers.

It was a coon... raccoon.

The executor of
this masked murderer

Is a timid college student
named Ty Smallwood.

And naturally, everyone
affected at the campsite

Is hailing his name.

I think he's a saint.

Uh, he dropped his
gun on the ground

And shot the thing by accident.

DICK WEENER: There was
some dissension, however,

From a local liberal hippy,
who according to sources

Lives and defecates
in the woods.

There's more!

There's a whole family of them!

A whole family!

There's a whole family of them!

There's a whole family!

Stop, stop, stop!

DICK WEENER: But
for now, campers

And authorities
both are determined

To enjoy the happy occasion.

We're holding a big
celebration here for Tom today.

Ty.

Right.

Tom.

See all the bloody
details and sports tonight

On Network News at 11:00.


There you go.

Yeah.

TY: I... I promised
I wouldn't do that.

I'd like to propose a
toast to my best friend.

He's not a winner,
he's not a loser.

He's a "Ty."

Thanks, buddy.

Hey, pussies.

Let's play some cornhole.

Let's get out of here.

What?
Why?

I just...

Sex.

Oh.

Take your time, you two.

Come on!

Cornhole!

Didn't two of your
best friends just like,

Die in the past two days?

Yeah, but I'm not a pussy.

Fag.

CHARLESWORTH: Danger, stop
worrying about those kids.

You deserve a break.

RICK DANGER: Still
gotta do my job.

Aw, can't what's
his face watch him?

No, Shane's off for the night.

Welcome.

I drink to our success
and future endeavors.

Naturally.

Who ever thought
raccoons would be so mean

And dangerous. [Inaudible].

Come on, Danger.

What are ya?

A pussy?

We've done great
work here today.

[Imitating trumpet]

DICK WEENER: And we understand
the hero is a virgin.

So hopefully after this
event, he will get laid.

God is on his side.

Thank goodness the raccoons
are no longer a threat...

Ty, you haven't been rewarded
yet for saving the day.

Oh, I don't... I
don't need a reward.

Just Ty being Ty, you know?

You have never
had sex, have you?

I think they were going to make
s'mores back at the campground.

They said they were going
to do it right after

They sing the kumba... um...

Who wants a song?

Yeah.

No!


Kumbaya!

Kumbaya, my Lord.

Kumbaya!

Kumbaya, my Lord.

Kumbaya...

Remember, stop
only means harder.

ALL (SINGING): Kumbaya, my lord.

Kumbaya!


Ah!

ALL (SINGING): Kumbaya, my Lord.

Kumbaya!

Hello?

Hello?

Who's there?


Ah!

ALL (SINGING): Kumbaya.

Oh, Lord, Kumbaya!


Ah!

Stop!

Stop!

Stop!

Ah!


Ah!

I know this reporter
first discovered the...


Excuse me.

Would you like to
take a picture?

ALL (SINGING):
Oh, Lord, Kumbaya.

Say pussy, bitch.


Holy virgin of pussy.

What's wrong, buddy?


[Rock music]

[Screaming, growling]




Help me, cornhole.



Are you guys hearing anything?

Don't think so.

Why?

Shit snakes, they're back!

TY (VOICEOVER): I can't
believe I'm finally doing it.

And she's a screamer.


Ah!

Shit snakes, only
one more bullet.

Ty.

Oh!

Zach, man!

Jesus!

Ty, man, did you get laid?

The best summer break ever.

Oh, God.


You guys head back
to that campsite.

I'm going to go
check on the doctor.


Goddamn.

No!

No, Doc!

Not you, too!

Rick, Rick.

I can't see, Rick.

Rick, they're smart.

They left me alive.

We're gonna get you out of here.

No.

No use.

Your gun.

Help me, Rick.

Shit, don't you say that.

We're going to get
you out of here.

Rick, help me.

Help me.


That's the same
racoons, all right.

My God, there are more
of them out there.

God had nothing
to do with this.

Let's head back to the station.

See if we can find
some survivors.

Oh, will one of you
fellas put out the fire?

I don't want to lose my job.


Ah!

Aw, sweet [inaudible], man.


[Louder chirping]

Run.

Shit snakes.

Danger, you might got
yourself a little bit

Of a raccoon problem.

RICK DANGER: Looks like we're
going to need a new base.

I know a place they can't get.

RICK DANGER: Well, I
was wrong about this.

My God, they got one over here.

JONES: Mother fucker.

Them fuckers is armed, too.

RICK DANGER: Gentlemen,
think I'm gonna cry.

POOKIE: Oh, Danger.

Come now.

It's all right.

It's OK.

It's all right.


I... I can't watch
another man cry.


Neither can I.

[All sobbing]

[Hippie music]

ANNOUNCER: Ladies
and gentlemen, Ty!

So you fucked any hot
dead chicks lately?

This guy's dead serious.

Let's go down to the morgue and
all get laid by dead chicks.

[Crowd groaning]

Ty, you must be strong.

You must conquer your fear.

I am with you.

I will always be with you.

Ah!

Janine!

Where am I?

Ah!

An Arab.

Ah.

With a lighter.

Easy, friend.

You're safe here.

Are you holding me hostage?

He's no bigger
threat than the CIA,

You ungrateful corporate copy.

The only thing
holding you hostage

Is a family of angry raccoons.

I have been saying all along.

Friend, my name is Al Jazeera.

You can call me Al.

Who are you?

Hi.

I... I'm Ty.

AL: Well, Ty.

Welcome to our fort.

It's built for these very
raccoon attacks you survived.

Wha... what do you mean?

He's got no idea, man.

The whole public's got no idea.

Forgive me.

I should mention that
the old man and I

Sort of knew the events
of the last few days

Were gonna happen.

There were signs leading
up to it all along,

But nobody paid attention.

JEFF TUCK: The raccoons are
waging a battle on mankind.

It is their destiny.

AL: He told me about it when
I first came to the woods.

I got kicked out of the
university for, well,

Let's just say for
being different.

Brown skin, beard.

Anyway, Tuck said
he'd train me to be

A warrior for a great fight.

We've more or less declared a
jihad on the little bastards.

But unfortunately, coons are
winning at this point... Viet

Cong style.

But how is this possible?

You knew?

There's been so much death.

My best friend, girl I
lost my virginity to.

Both dead.

AL: That's a shame.

First time's usually special.

JEFF TUCK: Yeah, first time's
usually pretty special.

Very cherished memory.

I remember mine.

I remember it too. [Inaudible].

I want to be a warrior, too.

I mean, I know I just met
you guys and everything,

But, uh, I need something
to do with my life.

You'll have to
tell him the story.

It was always known
coons would come back.

It was just a matter of when.

See, back in the Roaring '20s,
this land was a raccoon farm.

And raccoon fur coats... 15 coons
would make a nice, plush coat.

Well, when the
depression came around,

Then facilities rotted
and the farm went under.

Raccoons were left in
their cages to starve.

Some escaped... escaped to
the mystic Indian worshipping

Grounds.

They escaped to the
societies of man.

They caught the diseases.

They knew to come back?

The Aztecs used to call
mother racoons [non-english],

She who talks with gods.

What do you mean?

JEFF TUCK: These raccoons
are like no other animal

Amongst us, man.

They got no other
enemies except us.

And I had a tussle with one
of them a few years back.

He took my left ball,
and I took him for a hat.

And after I killed him, it
inspired this little number.

in the simmon tree.

That possum on the ground.

Possum say to the raccoon, sir,
please throw these things down.

Raccoon say to the possum, sir,
they smile from down below.

If you want these good
simmons, then just

Climb up where they grow.


Ho, ho, ho, ho!

God.

Man.

He do this every night?

Yeah.

Pretty much.

JEFF TUCK: Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Did you guys here that fart?


They've surrounded us all right.

Like fucking "Dallas," man.

I've got it!

I've got it.

Hello, come in.

Hello, can anyone hear me?

Come in.

Come in.

Is anyone there?

Hello?

Mayday!

Roger.

Mayday, mayday!

Roger, roger!

Little bird to big bird.

Hello?

This is Ranger Rick Danger.

Where are you calling from?

Who is this?

I'm calling from
Raccoon Creek Campground.

We've escaped to a
hideout on the North hill

And we're completely
surrounded by raccoons.

Repeat, our position
is surrounded.

How many of you are there?

There are three of us.

Two in college and
one old hippy man.

Tuck.

POOKIE: Praise Jesus.

There are survivors.

Looks like we're gonna
need a rescue party.

Somebody get their coordinates.

I gotta call the mayor.

This is going to take
some super strength.

They're sending a rescue party.

And then what?

JEFF TUCK: Then we
convince them to follow us.

Follow us where?

To the den.

All right, men.

These little bastards have
taken a lot of people out.

Now, if we succeed
today, it'll be

The greatest kill of our lives.

Now do it for... do
it for Independence,

For America, and for the
whole goddamn human race.

We will not be
beaten by raccoons!

Come on!

Let's go up this hill!

Come on!

RICK DANGER: Well, well
no... well, yeah, but things

Are looking up, really.

Do you realize what a
fucking nightmare I'm in?

I got reporters, parents,
the AAAAA up in my grille.

He wants to talk to you.

Danger, my plane is
minutes from here.

Let me drop some anti-disease
gas into this area.

I've done it before.

It works wondrously.

Blasphemy.

If the hunt fails, we must
turn to the ways of Jesus.

Exorcism should
not be ruled out.

Sure.
Fine.

Just talk to the mayor.

MR. MAYOR: Hello?

Yes?

Hi, Mr. Mayor.

MR. MAYOR: Is the scat real?

It's true, I've seen it.

This stuff is
incredibly dangerous.



Goddamn!



Aw, goddamn.




Fuck this.

I'm getting the plane.

CENSOR: Can't you see this
violence is destroying

Our children's minds?

Sounds like it's going well.

Yeah, all for talking, man.

This ain't doing shit.

We got to get to
the den ourselves.

Grab the fireworks.

Uh, why... why do we need to
go to the den with fireworks?

To destroy their secret hole.

Well, no, sir.

Everything's fine.

They're just returning
a little bit of fire.

That's all.
Really?

So they're armed, now?

Jesus Christ, you
are pathetic, Danger.

Now I have to save the whole
town and its reputation.

You can evacuate, and
you are freaking fired.


Operator, get me Washington.

Well, I did not
see that one coming.

All right.

All right, Jonesey.

Gotta outsmart the
little fuckers.

Game of wits.


Let's do it!

All right.

[Trap collapsing]


Aw, fuck!



[Trap collapsing]


Goddamn!



Bring it on, you furry fucks!


Danger, let me get
the book on them guys.

These things don't stand
a chance against Jesus.

Nothing ever does.

All right, I'm going to
go place some fireworks.

You boys meet me in
10 with the fleet.

Don't steal nothing.

Hear me, Lucifer.

Your evil ways are
not wanted here.

We will smite you down in the
pristine face of the Lord.

Oh, my.

Oh.

Oh, that's quite unpleasant.


Are they still coming?

I don't know.

We must put our
faith in the old man.

[Music playing]

[Airplane soaring]


Where are you, you
little bastards.

Danger, Danger.

They're... they're throwing
scat at the plane.

I think I can manage...

[Loud chirping]


[Chirping, screaming]

[Radio cuts out]

The plane killed Tuck!

I fucking hate planes.

Al Jazeera, don't
you lose faith now.

It's not over yet.

And it's over.

Lose faith now, because
Raccoon Creek Campground has

Been taken by killer raccoons.

Al, come on, man.

You're supposed to
be the warrior here.

We have no fireworks.

We have no way of
getting out of here.

No, but we have...

[Distinct talking]

Hey.

Listen.

What?

How... how did you get here?

What... what happened
to all the raccoons?

Well, I heard over the radio
that the raccoons were taking

Over the camp and I was
like, hey, when my mom wanted

To get raccoons
out of the garden,

She just turned on talk
radio and they scattered.

They hate it!

So, I started running
here as fast as I could,

And I looked over there
and I saw the flare

And I looked there
and I saw a torch.

But I got tired, so
I took a seat here.

You said you saw a flare?

Yeah, just right over there.

Tuck!

Ow!

Come on, Shane.

Bring your talk radio.

Fuck, yeah.

I'm ready.

RICK DANGER (VOICEOVER): I might
even be a hero someday, Dad.

Just like you.

Hi, I'm Dick Weener.

Network News now has
this shocking footage.

According to sources, the
death toll is astronomical.

And coming up, another
astronomical story as a puppy

Learned how to be an astronaut.

That, and the mayor.

[Indistinct talking on radio]

AL: Tuck!

Tuck, are you OK?

Peace.

Peace, love.

Hendrix.

Hendrix!

Hendrix!

I got my ball back.

TY: Uh, Tuck, that's a nut.

Yeah.

Did you bring a flame?

Hey.

No revolutionaries win the
battle... win the battle.

Let's roll.

[Rattling, growling]


Electric shock you
can't fuck with.

Jones!

Pookie!

Billington!

Charlesworth!

Shit snakes!

Shit snakes!

Shit snakes!

Shit snakes!

Shit snakes!

Shit snakes!

[Stabbing, yelling]

DICK WEENER: So, Mr. Mayor,
you're telling me you have

A plan to save Independence?

Yes.

Yes, I do.

Amazing and heroic.

And during this time,
were people blaming you?

Were people mayor-hating?

Yes, people were
hating on a mayor.

Mayor what?

Mayor, please.

Hey, what about that puppy?

MAN (ON RADIO): Carpet... what
is this American obsession

With carpet?

I just don't get it, and I
really don't care for it.

I think it's a scam run
by carpet salespeople

All over the country.

Hey, they sold you
a boatload of goods.

If God intended for your
floor to have carpeting,

He would have made
wood with hair.

But he didn't...

Over there.


Let's blow it up.

[Indistinct chatter on radio]

All right, give me the lighter.

Shit.

Where do you want to put it?

[Radio breaking up]

Oh, boys, we're losing power.

Blast.

Shit.

Come on, come on, come on.


We're gonna have to fight.

How are we supposed
to kill these things?

AL: In any way possible.

Ah!

[High-pitched screaming]


Guys, I feel like Rambo.

Over there.

I see a way out.

Come on.


Some warrior I
turned out to be.

JEFF TUCK: I'd take you
over Charlie any day.

Tuck!

What are you doing here?

Run, you fools.

Save yourself, man.

Tuck, no!

JEFF TUCK: Save yourselves!

Tuck, no!

You hateful sons of bitches.

This time, you've
met your match.


[Music playing]

[Fireworks exploding]

Hey, look.

I had my lighter in
my shoe all along.

[Growling, chirping]

Yeah.

Yeah!


Did I just hit something?

Probably one of those
singing white people.


Raccoons are finally dead.

Their mystic ways
are finally over!

I don't even know what either
of you two are talking about.

Whatever.


STRANGE MAN: Hey!

You boys gonna eat this?

[Creepy laughter]

[Indistinct police radio]

What the hell?

Son, it, uh, says
here that you're black.

AAAAA MEMBER: Yeah?

Mind if you step out of
the car for me, buddy?

What you got in there, buddy?

A little cellphone?

Call your, uh, your... your
brothers or to call your wife?

You boys the, uh, stranded
party from the woods?

Yes, sir, we are.

We blew up the raccoons' den.

They won't come back.

You say you blew it up?

Yes.

MR. MAYOR: And what did
you say your name was?

Al.

Al Jazeera.

Oh, OK.

Neat.


And, uh, Shane, you
were a part of this?

Um... um, yeah.

Yeah, I was.

I got you a Happy Camper
CD and some tickets

For their free
concert this weekend.

You're going to love it.

And if we could just
be quiet about what

Happened this weekend, OK?

Yeah.

Yeah, OK.

I don't understand.

Ty, I'm afraid I just can't
let you destroy the raccoons.

You see, I just signed a big
contract with the Pentagon.

Scat is a phenomenal
biological weapon.

Independence is back on its feet
and I'm going to make millions.

DICK WEENER: All right, I
want Chicago, I want New York,

I want Miami.

Hey, uh, we've got an underage
kid drinking here again, guys.

Let's move in.

DICK WEENER: Anybody
and everybody

Gives a shit about Raccoon
Creek to hear about the story.

All right, take
off the lens cap.

Take off the lens cap.

Dick Weener live on the
scene for Network News,

Where it appears that the siege
at Raccoon Creek Campground

Is over.

No!

No!

It's the raccoons!

It's the government!

It's gone straight to the top!

Mr. Mayor, what are
these incidents all about?

Dick, I just think
it's nothing more

Than the usual bunch of college
kids drinking in the woods.

And there you have it.

Once again, the youth of
America play games with alcohol

And Independence loses.

How was that?

Was that pretty good?

Looks good, Mr. Weener.
Great.

Let's get the fuck out of here.

This place gives me the creeps.

[Music playing]


THEME SONG: They love
the taste of leftovers.

But flesh will suit them well.

Their shriek will
pierce the night

Before they send you to hell.

They'll take a bite at midnight
or they'll eat you up at noon.

They're hungry.

They're killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They call them killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They're hungry.

They're killer raccoons.

If their fangs don't get you,
their scat most surely will.

The beast that lives within it
drives to the brain to kill.

For if your hit with their
shit, you're sure to die soon.

They're lethal.

They're killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They call them killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They're lethal.

They're killer raccoons.

So, America, get ready
for this fearful fight.

Your lives will change forever
due to bandits in the night.

Their forays in May will
only frequent in June.

They're everywhere,
they're killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They call them killer raccoons.

Raccoons, raccoons.

They're everywhere.

They're killer raccoons.

They're everywhere.

They're killer raccoons.

They're everywhere.

They're killer raccoons.

They're everywhere.

They're killer raccoons.

[Rock music]

RICK DANGER (SINGING):
Your friend, Zane,

Got a little insane when
he tried to hit the sauce.

REX (SINGING): But if
we kill these coons

In the name of Zane, then his
life ain't completely lost.

RICK DANGER (SINGING): All we
gotta do is kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore.

TY (SINGING): I have it
made if I were to get laid,

And now is really my chance.

If I kill these coons
and impress Janine,

I'll have some
company in my pants.

ALL (SINGING): All he's
gotta do is kill the coons!

Kill the coons!

Gotta, gotta, gotta
kill the coons.

Kill the coons until we
just can't kill anymore.

Night of the bandits of
the night of the bandits

Of the night of the bandits
of the bandits of the night

Of the bandits.

MAN (ON RADIO):
And, as usual, you

Are listening to the
one and only WRZN right

Here in Independence.

All talk radio, all the time.

And all of us here
at the radio stations

Encourage you to tell
your friends to listen in.

Oh, hi, there.

Looks like some little
cuddly forest creatures

Wandered into our studio.

Hey, my little masked friend.

You're kind of cute.

Hey, how about a little
bite of my sandwich?

Yeah?

Oh, hey!

I... I said sandwich,
not handwich!
