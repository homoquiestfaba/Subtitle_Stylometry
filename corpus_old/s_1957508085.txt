I know I'm late, Charlie.

MAN: "In this broad
Earth of ours,

"Amid the measureless
grossness and the slag,

"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

"Nestles the seed Perfection."

The poet's hope and optimism
in humanity

echoes our recent
universal victory,

the return of half
our population...

And, thank God, there she is.

Our brilliant museum
scientist, Ms. Sersi,

the person who will be

and was always supposed to be

giving you your
presentation today.

Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

Today, we'll be learning
about the importance

of apex predators in
a balanced ecosystem.


DANE: I completely
ran out of things to say,

and these kids
make me nervous.

Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

MAN: See you tonight.

Ooh! "See you tonight."
(STUDENTS LAUGH)

All right, settle down.

So...

who can tell me
what an apex predator is?

Animals that hunt their
prey for food.

Very good.

Apex predators do hunt
their prey for food,

like all predators.

But one thing that sets
them apart

is that there are no other
animals in their habitat

strong enough to hunt them.

Who can give me an example?

Lions.

Wolves.
SERSI: Correct.


Earthquake.


SERSI: Get down. Get down!
(STUDENTS SCREAMING)

It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

Let me help you.
Don't worry,
it'll pass soon.

(STUDENTS SCREAMING)

DANE: Is this from the

SERSI: It has
your family crest.

It must have cost
a fortune.

I'm a good eBay bidder.

Thank you.

Happy birthday. (CHUCKLES)

So, have you given
any more thought

to us moving in together?

Yeah, I... I thought about it.

I can't move in with you.

Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Thought you'd say that.

I'm sorry.

And I think I know why.

Are you a wizard?

What?

Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

No. I'm...

I've noticed some unusual
things happen

when I'm around you.

Like our water always
turns to coffee

whenever the waiter
ignores us.

That's your caffeine
addiction talking.

And Sprite says things...
Mm.

...like you and your
ex-boyfriend

broke up a century ago.

She said that?

And he can fly.

He's a pilot.

SPRITE: Get a room, you two.

Can we go now?
It's past my bedtime.

(DANE SIGHS)

Are you really in love?

What if I am?

SPRITE: You better tell him
the truth, then.

SERSI: I'm working on it.

You guys wanna get pizza?

BOTH: No, thank you!

He won't live forever,
you know.

Move in with him.

SERSI: I live with you.

Dane.


Shit! Is that
a Deviant?

Dane, run!


Sersi?
Let's go.

(DANE SCREAMS)

What is that thing?
A Deviant!

You said you killed
them all!

You told him that?

You believed me?
I do now!


What are you doing?

Keep Dane safe!

Sersi, wait! What?

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

You're fine, dude.

Sprite!

No. Stairs.

Did it just heal itself?

(UNINTELLIGIBLE GROWLING)


Ikaris.

It's good to see you.

It's good to
see you, too, Sprite.

I'm Dane.

Hello, Dane.

Well, I guess you must
be the pilot.

(SIREN WAILING)

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(INDISTINCT POLICE
RADIO CHATTER)

SERSI: We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

We came here
7,000 years ago
on the Domo,

our starship, to protect
humans from the Deviants.

We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago,

but now they're back.

Look, if you don't
want to move in with me,

you could just say.

Dane, this is serious.

Oh, I know. I'm just
still getting

over the fact you're
not a wizard.

I was hoping you could
change me into a giraffe.

I always wanted to be
a giraffe when I was a kid.

It's too bad I can't change
sentient beings.

You would have made
a very cute giraffe.

Why didn't you guys help
fight Thanos?

Or any war?

Or all the other
terrible things
throughout history?

We were instructed

not to interfere in any
human conflicts

unless Deviants
were involved.

Why?

SERSI: If we'd protected
humanity from everything

for 7,000 years,

you'd never have had
the chance to develop

in the way
you were meant to.

But if the Deviants were
eradicated a long time ago,

why are you still here?

We've been waiting...

to be told we can go home.

(SIGHS DEEPLY) So...

Ikaris.

The boy who flew
too close
to the sun.

Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

In the fifth century BC?

How long were
you two together?

5,000 years.

I guess you can call
that long-term.

What happened?

He left.

I always thought
he'd come back, but...

he never did.

So, I moved on.

I'm glad you did.

I'm sorry.

I have to go.

REPORTER: This morning,

an unprecedented
global earthquake

swept nation-states
across the world,

causing damage and panic.

Many have speculated
its connection with the Blip.

The UN has called
for an emergency meeting...

That Deviant healed itself.

They could never
do that before.

And it was coming after us
instead of humans.

What's going on?

I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

That Deviant is news to me.

Something's happening
to Earth.

Can't be a coincidence.

We need to find the others.

I haven't seen
some of them for centuries.

IKARIS: I doubt
much has changed.

I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

But we need
to stick together.

And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

Let's go to Ajak first.

She'll know what to do.

You hear that, Sprite?

Family reunion.

It's about time.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

Hey, that one was mine!
Oh, never mind.

(HEROIC MUSIC PLAYING)

(SOFT ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING)

ARISHEM: Ajak.

Arishem.

We continue to keep Babylon
safe from the Deviants.

More people have come
to seek refuge.

It is now the largest
city on Earth.

ARISHEM: The Eternals serving
their missions

across the galaxies

will learn from your success.

Thank you.

I respect
your grand design, Arishem.

But I have noticed something
special about this planet.

And I fear that maybe
this time the cost may...

ARISHEM: Do not become
attached to this planet.

You must focus on the true
purpose of your mission.

I understand.

I will not let you down.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

AJAK: Phastos.

Did you go to the party
last night like I told you to?


Yeah, it was...
MAN: He worked all night.

PHASTOS: Who was
talking to you?

AJAK: Get a life.

And where is Sersi?
Late as usual.

PHASTOS: I'm sorry,
but I have something

very exciting
to show you, okay?

Wait till you see this.

(EXHALES HEAVILY)

What is it?

PHASTOS: It's an engine.

It moves steam from
high pressure
to low pressure.

Uh, it'll help them
till their fields

at an incredibly
fast rate.

It's gonna freak them out.

I mean, they only have had
the wheel 1,000 years, so...

You know,
we could do that thing

where you use your mind
to control them

and then they could
do it quicker.

Ajak, you listening
to this?

Phastos, this steam...

Engine. It's a steam engine.
It's too soon.

And there she is.

What did I miss?

Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

AJAK: I am sure
you have something simpler.

PHASTOS: Simple.

Okay, let's see. Uh...

Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

the plow.

'Cause that's what it does.

Plows dirt.

I met another group
of settlers

who are building their homes
in the northern fields.

They'll need to plant
their own crops.

Thanks, Sersi.
AJAK: Listen,

humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

But there is no telling
what wonders

they will discover
as they advance.

(IN BABYLONIAN)
The wonders of the
world await you.

Follow Gilgamesh and
Enkidu into battle.

Be forever inspired
by their bravery and strength.

You and your fellow man...

...will go on great
adventures.

And become legends
of your own!

(CROWD CHEERING)

GILGAMESH: (IN ENGLISH)
I just saw that.

There's so many
other chairs, man.

KINGO: You know,
I could use my powers...

Come and have
a drink with me.

No.

I can't let you
go and fight
Deviants on your own.

We need to guard the city.
Get out of my way.

I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

We need to trust Arishem's
design for this planet.

Hmm.
Thena.

It's an honor to fight
alongside you.

And you.

My beautiful Makkari.

You're late.

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE) I needed
to get enough artifacts
to make a good trade.

(IN BABYLONIAN)
Just lie to her.

IKARIS: I promise I won't
let my feelings for Sersi

distract me from my mission.

Humans are far from being able

to protect themselves
from the Deviants.

We still have much to do.

is strong.

I can feel it.

But you are allowed
to live a life, you know?

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Try.

I'm making a mess.

(IN BABYLONIAN) See you.

I need to get to know them.

(SPEAKING BABYLONIAN)
I am very beautiful.


(IN ENGLISH) Wait,
what did I say?

You said,
"I am very beautiful."

You are

Ajak!


(THUNDER RUMBLING)


It was a Deviant.

(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

â™ª And our devotion

â™ª Were as deep as any ocean â™ª

It was the last time
I saw her.

Ajak asked me
to check on Sersi,

so I went to London.

Turned out, both of us
were lonely

and we needed each other.

I guess, in her way,

Ajak never stopped
trying to take care of us.

Bye, Ajak.

It's the first time
in 7,000 years

one of us has died.

I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London

killed Ajak and absorbed
her power.

Deviants have never
done that in the past.

SPRITE: It healed itself
just like Ajak.

I swear,
I almost heard it speak.

(ELECTRICITY BUZZES)

(ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING)

Arishem.
ARISHEM: Sersi.

It is almost time.

Sersi! Sersi!
Are you okay?

What happened, Sersi?

The sphere that Ajak used
to talk with Arishem,

it came out of her body
and went inside me.

Did you talk with Arishem?

SERSI: Yes. He said

it's almost time.

Can you try talking
to him again?

I don't know how.

But she chose you to
replace her.

And she gave you
the sphere.

Hold on, Sprite.

Are you sure
you talked with Arishem?

What else would it be?

Mahd Wy'ry.

Where are the others?

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
We had to split up.

There were more Deviants
than you said.

that was a lot of fun
for you.

It was.

kill these last Deviants,

we will have eliminated them
all from the planet.

(ENERGY HUMS)
Don't.

We don't interfere
in their wars.

DRUIG: This isn't war.

It's genocide.

Their weapons
have become too deadly.

Maybe it wasn't
such a good idea

helping them
advance, Phastos.

Technology is a part
of their evolutionary
process, Druig.

It's not exactly something
that I can stop.

No, you can't. But I can.

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
Stay strong.

THENA: It's too late.

SERSI: Thena?
Everyone is going to die.

Are you okay?

Thena?


Thena? Thena, no!

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

Don't listen

Listen to my voice.

You are safe.

You are loved.

You're our Thena.

Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

Is she okay?

Sersi.

Thena, please.

Come back to us.
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

Okay.


(LOUD THUD)


(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

I thought Mahd Wy'ry
was a myth.

There is no cure...

so no one
really talks about it.


(BREATHING HEAVILY)

What happened?

AJAK: Thena.

You attacked everyone.

Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

you nearly killed Makkari.

I don't remember.

AJAK: You have Mahd Wy'ry.

Your mind is fracturing

under the weight
of your memories.

And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship

where we have the technology

to help you.

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
But she won't be Thena
anymore.

What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

She could have killed
all of us.

Please.

Please, I...
I want to remember.

I want to remember my life.

Thena, I love you.

But listen to me.

It's not important
if you remember or not.

Your spirit will remain.

You will always be Thena
deep inside.

Trust me.

Why should she trust you?

You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

Druig, I know
you're upset, but...


We've trusted you
for 7,000 years,

and look where
you've gotten us.

I've watched humans
destroy each other

when I could stop it all
in a heartbeat.

Do you know what that does
to someone after centuries?

Could our mission
have been a mistake?

Are we really
helping these people

build a better world, huh?

(DISTANT CLAMORING

(DRAMATIC MUSIC RISES)

(EERIE INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

GILGAMESH:
I'll watch over Thena.

Let her keep her memories.

AJAK: One day,
when she attacks you,

you might have to kill her.

We'll take that chance.

You may all go.

The Deviants are gone.

There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

Shouldn't you ask
Arishem first?

We're a team,
we should stay together.

I didn't ask you
for your advice, Ikaris.

Do not forget your place.

This is where we say goodbye.

You are free to go.

I want you to go out there.

And live a life
for yourselves.

Not as soldiers.

Not with the purpose
you were given.

Find your own purpose.

And one day,

I want you to tell me
what you found.

We need to talk
to you in private.

Oh, Karun, he's worked
with me for 50 years.

I trust him completely.

Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire,

and he tried to stake me
through the heart.

I have apologized
so many times.

Not quite enough times.

Very close, though.
I'll let you know.

Oh, I have to get ready
for the next scene.

Come to my tent,
we'll talk there.

You guys are gonna love

Well, I am. But I am also...

an Eternal.

are you doing?

KINGO: I think we should be

I am making a documentary
about us.

You are about to meet

Sprite, tell them

Oh, wait.

Okay, well,
we'll circle back to her.

This is Sersi.

Sersi,

tell them about yourself.

Uh...

Well, uh...

I can change
a rock into water.

Uh, I could turn
a rock into wood.

Or a rock into metal.

Actually, one time,
I turned a rock into air.

Cut.

Um, you know what?
Why don't you think about it,

and we'll get back
to you, okay?


Sprite says
you're addicted
to this thing.

Oh, this? (CHUCKLES)

Look at this.

Whoa. (CHUCKLES)

SERSI: You know,
seeing as we don't age.

I think you look quite good.

Don't you?

how you managed

to be the leading man

Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

That is my
great-great-grandfather,

that is my great-grandfather,

grandfather,

father, and me.

I'm part of
the greatest dynasty

in the history of Bollywood.

Pretty impressive, right?

You abandoned me in Macedonia.

Okay, I got sick
of moving every five years.

People freak out when they
notice that you don't...

age.

I thought we were friends.

KINGO:Do you know why
I love movies?

Because of you.

I missed sitting
in the audience,

listening to your stories,

watching your illusions.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

We should've
all stayed together.

Ajak would still be alive.

She should have never
let us go.

This is the Deviant
you fought in London?

It's different.

There must be more out there
than we thought.

KARUN: Oh.

Is... Is this a Deviant, sir?

Yep.
(KARUN CHUCKLES)

It's a beautiful creature.

What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.

You've never had one

two of the greatest warriors

the world has ever known.

Thena, legendary,

I could have used some help.

Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

You couldn't?

Thena.

Everyone in Centuri-6

Give me your hand.

It's too late.
We can't save them.

Thena.

Thena.

We came to Earth
together on our ship.

You're an Eternal.

The greatest warrior
of Olympia.

The legendary protector
of Athens.

The goddess of war.

Remember who you are.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

GILGAMESH: Remember.

(ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYING)


Thena.
Hi.

Hello.

Hey, who's your gardener?

This is just what you guys
eat every day?

Yeah, this is amazing.
Every day.

Thank you for this.
Oh, you're welcome.

Help yourself.

This one is a trio of wine,
beer, and mead.

Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

That's so thoughtful.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

(LEND ME YOUR COMB BY
CARL PERKINS PLAYS ON SPEAKER)

Should she be drinking?

non-alcoholic. For kids.

I gave you
the same thing, Sprite.

(GILGAMESH AND KINGO LAUGHING)

KINGO: For kids.

GILGAMESH: I was just kidding.

Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you

after we helped defeat
Laufey's army in Tonsberg.
(ALL LAUGHING)

(LULLABY MUSIC CHIMING)
What? Oh.

I'm a big baby.

Very mature.
Can you stop?

Stop.
KINGO: Speaking of Odin...

Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone,

who do you think
is gonna lead the Avengers?

I could lead them.

I figure I'd be
good at that.
Yeah, you would.

Ajak didn't even choose you
to lead us.

KINGO: Whoa.
Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

Harsh.
I'm gonna let that one slide

because, you know,

you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

GILGAMESH: Oh,
so what, you can fly.

I'm better-looking,
everybody knows that.

(KINGO CHUCKLES)
IKARIS: Where you going?

I'm just gonna
get some air.

Mmm. This is
really good, Gil.

You know,
I could sell this.

Put my face on it,
move some units.

GILGAMESH: I made it
from corn.

I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.


SERSI: Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

Yeah, it's a planet.

She thinks
she used to live there

until it was destroyed.

Always talks about
massive quakes
ripping it apart.

Everyone died,
including herself.

We had an unprecedented global
earthquake three days ago.

Oh, that's what that was.

I thought I was drunk.

Ajak chose me
to lead us, but...

I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

I've tried so many times.

Maybe you're
trying too hard.

Sometimes, you just
have to listen.

(PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING)

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

ARISHEM: Sersi.

Arishem.

Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

We think it absorbed
her power.

And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

ARISHEM: It is a side effect
of the emergence.

The emergence?

It is time for you to learn

the true purpose
of your mission.

You were sent to Earth

to bring forth
the Celestial Tiamut.

Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

I plant Celestial seeds
into host planets

across the universe.

The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

In order to grow,

Tiamut needs vast
amounts of energy

from intelligent life.

The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans

until the Eternals
eliminated them.

Now, the human population
of this planet

has reached
the required amount.

It is time for
the emergence to begin.

(MUSIC CRESCENDOS)

(BREATHES HEAVILY) But...

everyone on Earth will die.

ARISHEM: The end
of one life, Sersi,

is the beginning of another.


Our universe is a constant
exchange of energy.

An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.

Celestials use energy

gathered from host
planets to create suns,

generating gravity,
heat, and light

for new galaxies to form.


Without us,

our universe will fall
into darkness.

All life will die.

Ajak knew the truth?

She has helped
many Celestials

to emerge
over millions of years.

So have you.

Earth was my first mission.

I was home, on Olympia.

ARISHEM: There is no Olympia.

(CELESTIAL MUSIC PLAYING)

This is your
true home, Sersi.

The World Forge.

It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

(GASPS SOFTLY)

(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

Everything dies except us

because we were never alive.

Why don't I remember
any of this?


ARISHEM: Because your memories
are erased and reset

after each emergence.

They are stored here.

Why do you keep them?

I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

I created the Deviants, Sersi,

for the same purpose
I created you.

Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.

I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them

so intelligent life
could grow.


But there was a flaw
in their design.

They evolved.

Became predators themselves.


And I lost control of them.

I built and programmed
you, Eternals,

to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution,

to correct my mistake.

Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place

as the Prime Eternal.

Do not fail me.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

And our past memories
are stored somewhere

in space?

SERSI: And Arishem
made the Deviants.

GILGAMESH: I'm sorry, Thena.

You tried to warn us.

SPRITE: The last time
Arishem reset your memories,

something must have
gone wrong.

What do you mean?

Well, that's what
Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

All this time,
Thena was remembering

all the other planets
we were sent to

and everyone dying
during the emergence.

GILGAMESH:
I thought we were heroes.

Turns out we're the bad guys.

KINGO: We're not
the bad guys, okay?

We've helped the Celestials

expand life across
the universe.

That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

Every time innocent lives

have been sacrificed
for the greater good,

it turns out to be a mistake.

We have to stop the emergence.

Sersi, we have no right to
stop the birth of a Celestial.

There has to be a way
Tiamut can emerge

without destroying the Earth.

We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

Could Druig control its mind?

Maybe put it to sleep?

SPRITE: "Put it to sleep"?

Are you serious?

Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

(GILGAMESH CHUCKLES)

So I could take a vacation
to Fiji, you know?

We're talking about
a Celestial, okay?

SERSI: We have to try.

Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

Right. (CHUCKLES)

I'm human.
I'm a little biased.

(SPEAKING HINDI)
The world is ending.

You need to go home.

(IN ENGLISH) And do what?

Watch TV?

When I could be
with the Earth's
original superheroes

as they try
to save the world?

Fine.

If you want to, stay.

KARUN: Thank you
very much, sir.

Gilgamesh,

could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

GILGAMESH: I thought
you like it, man.

We need to go. Now.

Find the others.

Once we're all together,

we'll decide what to do
about the emergence.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

It's very nice

Don't be fooled.

Hey. We're looking for Druig.

Is he here?

Yes.

How do you know Druig?

We're friends...

...from college.

(ENERGY WHOOSHING)

(IN ENGLISH) Hello, Sprite.

DRUIG: I missed all of you.

Please, make yourselves
at home.

You've given me
a lot of bad news

in one go, my lady.

Will you help us?

I am glad that...

(JUICE BY LIZZO

(RINGTONE STOPS PLAYING)

KINGO: Hey,
what's your service?

getting any bars.

(GILGAMESH SNORES)

DRUIG: Do you all remember
this forest? Beautiful.

It was the last place
we all lived together.

I've protected these people
for 20 generations now

from the outside world
and from themselves.

Your kind, my friend,
you will be responsible

for your own extinction
one day.

Don't you think?

I think we must learn
from our mistakes

and do better, sir.

You must not give up hope.
(ENERGY HUMMING)

Oh, no, you didn't.

Okay, new rule, no more
possessing people's valets.

Oh, where is your sense
of humor, Kingo?

I'm sorry, sir.

Don't apologize,
it's not your fault.

You are not a god.
You know that, right?

How ironic.
Kingo, the movie star.

I've directed
some things, too.

Oh, yeah? Like what?

Some Internet content.

How many views?

KINGO: I don't do it
for the views.

Let's go.
He's wasting our time.

SERSI: We need him.
DRUIG: Ikaris.

I missed you.

Are you gonna charm me
or threaten me?

I mean, there's
a third option,
if you prefer that.

It must be heartbreaking
to find out

that you're not
Mother's favorite.

And I'm sure
she'd be real proud

of what you've
been up to.
Druig, this is serious.

I'll tell you
what's serious.

I've just been told I've been
sent on a suicide mission

for the past 7,000 years,

and that my entire existence
is a lie.

So, excuse me
for not giving a shit

about your plan right now.

(DOOR SHUTS)

Druig sucks.

He does, sir.

(SOFT EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)

THENA: I don't like
this place.

GILGAMESH:
Druig needs to think,

and Sersi wants us
to wait, so...

we wait.
Mm.

I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

Those were the good old days.

What if I can't
fight anymore?

Of course you can.
Mm.

What if I hurt you again?

Come on.
You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.


Thank you.

For what?

For always
taking care of me.
Oh.

I'd do it again.

On any planet.

(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING)

KINGO: I like
watching him, too.

Jeez.

I don't think
it's creepy at all.

Have you read Peter Pan?

Okay, so, to me,
Ikaris is Peter,

Sersi is Wendy,

you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons,

and the rest of us
are the Lost Boys.

What's your point?

Tinker Bell's always been
in love with Peter.

And it's hard for her

'cause she can never
be with him.

I'm sorry, Sprite.

Kingo...

why did Arishem
make me this way?

KINGO: I don't know.

I thought you broke it.

Always bring backups.

You have
a very angry family, sir.

Yeah, it's a big issue.

What about King Midas?

Everything he touched
turned to gold.

Was that you?
Dane.

Confucius? Aristotle?
Call your uncle.

What? My uncle? No.

You've always wanted to make
amends with him, right?

Now is the time.
Trust me.

Sersi, you're so weird.
(LINE BREAKING UP)

Dane? Dane?
(LINE BEEPING)


You're breaking up?

How did he take the news?

Couldn't bring myself
to tell him

it was the end of the world.

There's nothing
he could do.

Sersi.

I'm worried about you.

If Arishem finds out

you're trying to stop
the emergence...

I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

I'm not afraid.

This violent cycle has to end.

Hey, stop worrying about me.

Old habit.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

Why did you leave?

I told myself

something must have
happened to you.

So, I waited.

Days became years,

and you never came back.

Sersi,

oh, I've missed you.

I didn't want to leave.

There's something
I have to tell...

SERSI: Ikaris!

Ikaris!


(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) Miss?

You're ok?

(IN ENGLISH) Watch out!

Clear the camp!

Get behind me!

SERSI: One of them
took Ikaris.

It's an ambush!


KARUN: Very nice, sir!

Are you mental? Hide!

We need action sequences.

did you bring, young man?

Her memories...

I understand now.

I can see what she saw.

So many planets.

So much life destroyed

every time a Celestial
is born.

Arishem used us

and left us to die
with each emergence.

We just wanted to survive.

And then he sent you.

I will kill you all

for what you have done
to my kind.

You are not saviors, Eternals.

You are murderers.

Ikaris!

(GILGAMESH BREATHING

Thena.

Hey.

Remember.

(GASPING SHARPLY)

(EXHALES SOFTLY)


No.

(CONTINUES SOBBING)

I'll remember.

(THENA CONTINUES SOBBING)

I'll remember.

(KARUN RECITING SCRIPTURE

(MOURNFUL MUSIC CONTINUES)

DRUIG: When I left,

I thought about
taking over the minds

of every human on this planet.

Violence, fear, greed,

all gone.

SERSI: Why didn't you?

Because without
their flaws,

they wouldn't be human.

Please, Druig.
You can't stay here anymore.

These Deviants
are trying to keep us

from killing their own kind.

They have a conscience now.

That makes them
more dangerous.

No, Sersi.

That makes them us.

Eternals and Deviants.

Arishem's children.

But you are asking me
to take control

of a mind of a Celestial.

I do not have
that kind of power.

We'll need Phastos.

DRUIG: Well, good luck.

He gave up on humans
a long time ago.

(WIND WHISTLING)

(PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING)

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

(CRYING SOFTLY)

I did this.

If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

Druig was right.

Our mission was a mistake.

These people...

they're not worth saving.

AJAK: Oh, Phastos.

They're not worth saving.


BOY: Thanks.
MAN: Give me a good one.

BOY: All right.
MAN: Over here.

BOY: And...

PHASTOS:
Oh, that's great, man!

Yeah!
BOY: Yeah!

Oh, yeah!
PHASTOS: Nice.

Good one.
All right, ready? Throw!

Oh, so close.

Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
Yeah, okay.

Watch this.
Let me see.
Let me see it.

BOY: Dad. I'm only a starter.

Hi.

Hello. Can we help you?
BOY: Throw it again.

Hey, Jack.
Ben. (CHUCKLES)

Hey, guys.
These are my friends
from college.

Uh, this is Sylvia
and, uh, Isaac.
That's Isaac.

Dad, that's Superman.

Dad, that's Superman!

Jack... That's really
funny, Jack.

No, no! He is Superman.
That is definitely
not Superman.

I saw him on TV.

He was in London,
fighting a monster.

And you were with a cape

and you were shooting
laser beams out of your eyes.

I don't wear a cape.
JACK: Oh, sorry.

PHASTOS: Okay,
well, we should
just go inside, right?

Can I call you Clark?

Is that what you go by now?
Because, you know...

You've called me worse.

PHASTOS: You got it, Jack?
JACK: Mm-hmm.

PHASTOS: Way to go.
JACK: Yes.

PHASTOS: All right.
Show me how it's done.

Round and round and round
and round and round.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Yep, you got it. Keep going.

(TV PLAYING FAINTLY)

Yeah. Incredibly
natural, guys.

So, after all these years,

even you fell
for Ajak's lies.

IKARIS: No need to rub it in.
Mm.

It all makes sense why she
wouldn't let us interfere

with human conflicts.

Conflicts lead to war,

and war actually
leads to advancement

in lifesaving technology
and medicine.

So our mission was never to

make a peaceful
or harmonious world,

but to increase the population
at all costs.

Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

IKARIS: That's bleak.

PHASTOS: Well, so is telling
your husband and your child

that they could be dead
within a few days.

Thought you'd
given up on humans.

I got lucky. Okay?

I have a family now.

They give me faith again.

And I see the good
in humanity in them

every single day.

So, look, I cannot help you.

I am never leaving them.
Phastos...

PHASTOS: I'm sorry, Sersi.

It was wrong for me
to use my powers

without thinking about
the consequences

in the first place.

So, now, I choose
to use my hands

to fix my child'
bicycle, okay?

Do you?

I don't use
my powers anymore.

IKARIS: You sure?

What are you...

What the hell
is wrong with you?

My child is right
down the hallway!

That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

Oh, my God.
I bet you've built

the perfect safe house.

What is this
even made of?

Vibranium?
PHASTOS: Don't!

Fall collection.

IKEA.

Ass.

PHASTOS: How did you even
deal with this guy

for over 5,000 years?

If you stay here,
you might as well

invite the Deviants to dinner.

Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

He has a point.

No, I'm sorry.
You can't just show up

in my life and expect me
to go with you.

I'm not gonna...
You should go, habibi.

You want me to go?

You know what my mom

would say to you right now,
right?

(SPEAKING ARABIC) Quit
procrastinating, Phil, and
take care of your business.

(IN ENGLISH)
He's a chronic procrastinator.

I'm not leaving
you two. No way.

I'm not happy about it,

but if there's a chance
for us to watch

Jack grow up to live
a life of his own,

we should take it.

At last my boredom is ending.

Have you seen my movies?

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
I don't have a DVD player.

KINGO: DVD?

It's all about streaming now.

is a Kindle.

Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

Miss me?

I'm sorry,
what are we watching?
Because this...

Is this new?
Are you two...

Because I hate it.

DRUIG: Phastos,

I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

Okay, get ready for it.

KINGO: Bracelets?

You made us bracelets?

PHASTOS: So, here's
a little Celestial 101.

Celestials are
the most powerful

energy generators
in the universe.

When Arishem made us,

he imbued us with infinite
cosmic energy

to keep our bodies
regenerating.

The bracelets, in theory,

shut down our
regeneration process.

And once that happens,

our bodies accumulate
extra cosmic energy.

What for?

Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

If I can find a way
to connect us all,

one of us could become
immensely powerful,

pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

forming...

a Uni-Mind.

"Uni" meaning "one,"
"mind" meaning "mind."

KINGO: Oh, no,
we heard you the first time.

Terrible name.
KINGO: We'll brainstorm...

"Brainstorm"!

That's a way better name!
No, I invented it,

so I'm calling it
whatever I want.

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
So suppose Druig can, say...
put Tiamut to sleep--

Then what?

We find humans a new home
on another planet.

Are we building
a big ship, too?

Take a pair
of each animal?

Well, you know
what's never
saved the planet?

Your sarcasm.

Space colonization
could take decades.

It can happen quickly
with our help.

What if we
end up accidentally
killing Tiamut?

We could be responsible
for billions of lives

not being created
across the universe.

Boss, am I right?

Say something, Ikaris.

You don't think
we should be doing this.

Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

Sersi should decide.

SPRITE: Forget who Ajak chose.

You're the strongest.

You should be making
this decision.

Fine. Just keep
lying to yourself.

Sprite.

(FOOTSTEPS RECEDE)

Okay, this is not...

Ikaris.
Don't run after him.

Kingo, I...

Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

when she wasn't there.

I'm okay, Kingo.

KINGO: If you think we should
do this, I trust you.

I will follow you

I will follow you to the end,

I'm not who you think I am.

I'm sure she's missed you.

If I'd gone
back to her,

I would only have
told her the truth.

She would've suffered

knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

AJAK: Ikaris.

We have to tell them
the truth.

What?

Why?
Because together

we might be able
to stop the emergence.

"Stop the emergence"?

Listen...

Ajak, I know it's hard
at the end...

Listen to me, Ikaris.

I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

And I have never doubted him.

Until now.
Why now?

Why now?

Five years ago,
Thanos erased

half of the population
of the universe.

Delayed the emergence.

But the people of this planet

brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

You know,
after I let you all go,

I traveled the world,
living among them.

I have seen them fight
and lie and kill,

but I have also seen them

laugh and love.

I've seen them
create and dream.

This planet

and these people...

have changed me.

The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

Not this time.

I trust you, Ajak.

I'll follow you to the end,

as I always have.

Thank you.

We have to bring
everyone back together.

There's something
I have to show you first.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

IKARIS: It's just up ahead.

They must have been trapped
in the ice for centuries

and broke free last week

when the glacier
started to melt

as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

I tracked them here.

I suspected you might
have changed your mind.

I can't let you
betray Arishem.

Why don't you
just kill me yourself?

When the others realize

something is happening
to the Earth,

they'll come to you.

When they find your body,

they'll know
the Deviants are back.

It'll keep them busy
until the emergence.

I've been loyal
to you, Ajak.

Kept your secret
for centuries,

lied to everyone
I cared about,

but never have I
doubted my purpose

to serve the Celestials.

Oh, Ikaris.

(AJAK SIGHS)

I've led you down
the wrong path.

It's the only path I know.

SERSI: Thought I'd
find you here.

I've thought about
this place a lot.

Amazing how things
change over time.

SERSI: Maybe we're the ones
who've changed.

I know you don't agree
with our plan.

I've always thought
of the Celestials

like the ocean.

They give life and they take
life away without bias.

If they were gone,

this universe
would eventually end.

What you're trying to do

is free humanity from
the natural order.

It's not natural
to allow all life

on an entire planet
to be destroyed.

Arishem's way is archaic
and violent.

I don't want to fight, Sersi.

It'll all end soon.

Except there is no end,
is there?

We'd carry on
without our memories

or free will

for eternity.

You're afraid.

I wouldn't mind
leaving this world.

I only wish that
when we do,

I would be able
to remember you.

I'm in love
with you, Sersi.

I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

Ikaris.

(ENERGY HUMS)

Sersi?


It's started. (PANTING)

PHASTOS: Oh, no. My God.

What about the Uni-Mind?

PHASTOS: I haven't
figured out a way

to connect us, but I'm close.

I'm very, very close.
SERSI: How much longer?

I don't know, Sersi!

Find the point
of emergence.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

DRUIG: You always knew
the end was coming.

It must be a relief.

That Deviant
is still tracking us.

Revenge won't bring peace
for you, Thena.

But killing it might.

Ikaris?

What are you doing?

IKARIS: I wanted you to leave
this world in peace.

Without knowing
about the emergence.

But I failed.

I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

(DISQUIETING MUSIC PLAYING)

I'm close to figuring it out.


Boss, what are you doing?

IKARIS: I've let this
go on long enough.

SERSI: Don't hurt him!
(PHASTOS GROANING)

He lied to us.

He already knew
about the emergence.

No, he didn't.

Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

What?

You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

IKARIS: No.

I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

If Ajak wanted you
to take her place,

why did she choose me?

What have you done?

He killed her.

I had to.

She loved you.

(PHASTOS WHIMPERS)

Did she?
SERSI: She loved you.

Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

To know that one day
all this would end?

To keep on lying to you?

If we gave humanity
the choice,

how many of them
would be willing to die

so that billions more
could be born?

We're not giving them
a choice.

Is this why
you're willing to kill?

You are so pathetic!

I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

I exist for Arishem.

As do you.

It's who you are.

I wouldn't change
a single thing

about who I am.

Born or made.

But I do not exist
for Arishem,

I exist for my family!

Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
I found Tiamut.

PHASTOS: No!
KINGO: Makkari!


Get out of here!

Kingo.

You do not turn
against your family.

Gilgamesh died
because of you.

IKARIS: You won't succeed
against me.

And I will kill
every one of you
if I have to.

(SERSI CRYING SOFTLY)


KINGO: Wait.

I'm going with you.

Sprite...

THENA: What is this?

Why did Sprite go with Ikaris?

KINGO: Because she loves him.

Oh, you guys didn't
pick up on that?

He really fooled us,
didn't he?

Karun, let's go.

Wait, where the hell
are you going?

I can't help you guys.

I still think
Ikaris is right.

So, that's it, huh?
Just gonna follow him?

I love the people
of this planet.

But if you stop
this emergence,

you are preventing so many
other worlds like this one

from being created.

I still have faith
in Arishem.

But I refuse
to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
We need you.

Even with my help,
we're no match.

It's Ikaris.

But...

I hope to see you
on the next planet.

(SPEAKING HINDI)
Thank you for all
you've done...

...for humanity.

It's been a great honor.


I will miss you all.

DRUIG: (IN ENGLISH) Look,

if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris,

we'll need to have
a backup plan.

All of our powers,
even if they're amplified,

are not enough
to kill a Celestial, so...

Well, Sersi did turn
a Deviant into a tree.

I'm sorry, what?

You didn't wanna
tell me that?

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
You've never been able
to do it before.

I don't know
how it happened, okay?

And I'm pretty sure
I couldn't do it again.

to try, don't you think?

Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

Our plan is to put Tiamut
to sleep, not to kill it.

I can't kill a Celestial.

Sersi. Sersi.

We can't!

We can't.

It's okay, Sersi.

I got this.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

There's no time
for that.

SERSI: I didn't see the lies
right in front of me.

I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

THENA: I asked Gilgamesh once

why he chose to protect me.

He said,

"When you love something,
you protect it.

"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

Sersi.

Get up.

Ajak chose you
for a reason.

PHASTOS: Sersi!

Sersi!

Oh, Sersi. We need you!

I already
gave that speech.

What?

You did... What...

Sersi, the sphere
inside of you,

it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

Maybe I can repurpose it

and create
a connection between, uh,

well, all of us.

And that can activate
the Uni-Mind.

Great.
Yeah.

But, um...

(SMACKS LIPS)
I have to take it
out of you.

Okay.

Do it.

(BREATHING SHAKILY)

Okay.

(ENERGY WARBLING)

Don't kill her.

Thena...

(PHASTOS BREATHES DEEPLY)
Do it.


(PHASTOS GASPING)

Will it work?

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

It has to.

You're really

IKARIS: Where's Druig?

THENA: He's busy.

Thena, play nice.

You've never had to fight me.

But I've always wanted to.

Go.

(GASPING QUIETLY)
Enough.



(STIRRING MUSIC PLAYING)

(IKARIS GROANING)

Thena, stop!

(THENA GRUNTS)







Why are you helping Ikaris?

PHASTOS: We can't
let it absorb our powers.

Too late.

Thena, he's trying
to goad you. Don't...


PHASTOS: Makkari!


Where's Sersi?

You always did
underestimate her.

Oh, no.

Not so fast.

Boss.

I don't know about you,

but this is really
satisfying, right?

IKARIS: Let me go, Phastos!
I can't let her do this!

I don't think so.

I've been wanting
to clip your wings

for a long time, Ikaris!


KRO: Thena.

Oh, you've changed.

You're broken.

Damaged.

Useless.

You can't protect any of them.

Sersi.

You're not powerful enough
to do this.

And you won't.

You're not a killer.

Maybe I've changed.

And is this really
who you are, Sprite?

Are you really willing to let
everyone on this planet die?

(BLADE STABS)

SPRITE: I'm sorry, Sersi.


I've always
envied you, Sersi.

'Cause you get to live
as one of them.

And I never could.

You know why I hated
living with humans?

Because they
reminded me of things

I didn't even know
I wanted.

Because of them,
now I wanna know

what it feels like
to grow up.

To fall in love.

To have a family.

And to know, in the end,
I've lived.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

It's all over now.

We get to start over
somewhere new.

(DRUIG PANTS)

Well, that was very moving.

SERSI: Druig.

I can't do this.

This is your fight now.

Thena.

It's me.

Gilgamesh.

Look at me.

Gilgamesh?

Stay here.


Say it.

Stay here.

You'll be okay.

Give me your hand.


Ah, it's a shame.

You and I,

we're just tools of a god.

Built to kill.

Remember.

PHASTOS: How?

How did you do it?

When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

I always wondered
how we survived

the destruction
of other planets
that we were on.

By being connected to
the Celestial as it emerged.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(IN SIGN LANGUAGE)
We became one...

...even Ikaris and Sprite

all because of Tiamut.

Is he gone?


Sprite.

I still have energy
from the Uni-Mind.

I think I can make you human.

you can have them.

But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

Are you ready for that?

I love you so much.

Are you okay?

I get confused sometimes.

Yeah. Me, too.

So, Dad said
you're the goddess Athena.

"Thena." Drop the "A."

JACK: Oh.
Hmm.

What's your superpower?

Um, can you just...
Look... One second.

Okay. All right.

See, that thing
is... Okay.

Almost gave you a shave
and a haircut, didn't she?

Stand behind me, actually.

Um, you remember earmuffs?

Remember how we practiced
earmuffs? Thank you so much.

You know that your
babysitting privileges

are completely revoked, right?

Like, it's done.

Thank you. (CHUCKLES)
Violence... Hey.

Violence is never
the answer.

Right, T?
THENA: Hmm.

You gotta always use
your brain, hmm?

Like you did fighting
on the beach?

Your dad

spoke calmly and firmly
to the bad guy

and he had no choice but to

listen to me,
so no violence.

JACK: Oh!

JACK: Yeah!

PHASTOS: Okay,
that's far enough, Jack.

JACK: Wow, Dad,
the Domo's so cool.

PHASTOS: Your dad fixed that
with his bare hands.

Can we go to space,
too, one day?

Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

Hey, Phastos.

Take care.

This world is lucky
to have you.

Thank you.

I know you're not
a hugger, so...

Okay. (CHUCKLES)

You think when we find
the other Eternals out there,

that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

to be in
a human environment.

You'll pick up
some social skills.

Oh, you didn't think
you needed those?

That explains so much.

SPRITE: Gonna miss you.

SERSI: Me, too.


Madam.

SPRITE: Thanks, Karun.

Sometimes I wonder
if we did the right thing.

Killing Tiamut.

KINGO: It's too late for that.

But you followed your heart.

We all did.

Even Ikaris.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

Looks like someone's
waiting for you.

He's a lot cuter in person.

DANE: So, after all that,

you still can't change me
into a giraffe?

Well, I could next time
I'm connected
to a Celestial

during an emergence
whilst performing
a Uni-Mind.

Yeah. That sounds like
a "no" to me.

What'll you do now?

SERSI: Not sure.

This planet's
my home, but...

I can't pretend
to be human anymore.

I love you, Sersi.

I don't care what you are.

Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

I have no more secrets,
I promise.

Actually,

I have one I want
to tell you.

What is it?

It turns out
my family history is...

complicated.
