[Music playing]

Yes, sir.

We're going to view the
footage momentarily.

Yes, sir.

I will, sir.

Immediately.

Are we ready?

Any time.

Just hit the switch.

Thanks.

That'll be all.

We'll call when we're done.

You ready?

Yeah.

OK.

The first part of
this is silent.

Trucker found her wandering
down the highway in a daze.

That's the girl's father, Duncan
Savage, the film's director.

Who's that?

It's the special effects
man, Harry Watson.

What's his status?

It's uncertain.

That's the movie's
producer, Frank Cohen.

His status hasn't been verified.

That's the last of the footage
we recovered, except for this.

[Gun shots]

[Gun shots]

My God.

[Phone rings]

Thank you.

Savage girl's here, Chris.

Good.

She's the only one that
can fill in the gaps.

Has she seen this film?

No.

Then keep it under wraps.

As of now, that
film does not exist.

Done?

Send in the girl.

Seal up that film and
put it back in the can.

Chris, this is a list of
the people we know about.

Come in, Kiersty.

My name is Chris Walters
and this is Mr. Stewart.

Hi.

Thank you for coming.

I don't really
understand why I'm here.

I've already talked
to the police.

I know.

I understand, dear.

But we need to hear
it one more time.

In order for us to
help you, we need

To know everything you know.

OK?

OK.

Would you care for
anything before we start?

No, Thank you.

Hold all calls.

Now, Kiersty, start at the
beginning and take your time.

There's no rush.

But please be as
accurate as you can.

We need to know every detail
that you can remember.

I was really excited
about spending

The summer with my dad.

I'd never been on
location with him before.

And the fact that he invited
me made it even better.

I remember we passed some no
trespassing signs on the way

To the location,
but dad said it was

OK, that we had
all of the permits

That we needed to shoot there.

The first few days I learned a
lot about how a film was made.

Everyone was real nice.

They all knew so much
about me, I felt like I

Had known then all my life.

Was there anything strange
going on between the cast

And the crew?

Just what you read in the
newspapers in the supermarket.

The man who was
playing the father

Was really sleeping
with the actress

Who was playing the daughter.

Busy, my ass.

What kind of bullshit
scene is this anyway?

Sav's never written so
much mushy shit before.

It's not that bad.

I think it's essential
for my character to show

His true love for his daughter.

You wouldn't know what would
be essential to a god damn shoe

Lace, let alone a character.

And by the way, stop
standing in my light.

Bad enough you can't act,
but don't ruin my close ups.

And stop trying to direct me.

I'm sorry.

I didn't mean it.

All right.

Just don't do it again.

If you um, listen to
me, I'll keep you happy.

[Squeaking sounds]

What about drugs?

A lot of that on the set?

No.

At least I don't think so.

Mr. Cohen would get real
mad whenever he saw it.

You know, angel, I
am really glad you

Could make it out here.

I'm really glad that
we could finally

Spend some time together.

Hopefully, I can
prove to you that I'm

Not a bad guy after all.

That's not what I've heard.

Don't believe
everything you hear.

Come on, eat.

You haven't touched a thing.

Frank, what brings
you out to the desert?

I gotta take a piss.

You come all the way out to
the desert to take a piss.

Don't fool around.

I'm gonna pee my pants.

Hi, Kirsten, sweetie.

How are you?

My, you've gotten
big and so pretty.

Thought you had to
use the john, Frank.

I gotta take a piss.
It's over there.

Excuse me.

[Sniffing sounds]

By the time I come out,
that shit better be gone.


Or you're fired.

What else?

I guess I was fighting
with the makeup

Girl for dad's attention.

Now, remember the
most important thing.

Yeah, I know, safety
during the stunts.

Not you, Stan.

Shave the back, don't cut.

And...

The dark circles
under your eyes.

See that?

Good people.

You've got to have good people
around you all the time.

I don't know how you
got in here, Stan.

Thanks a lot, Sav.

We'll be ready to go
right after lunch.

Keep us moving, sweetheart,
I got no time to waste.

I was into that
last scene, Sav.

That was great writing.

Well, thank you, honey.

[Clears throat]

There's my angel.

Sorry, Daddy.

Pull up a chair.

The first day Mr. Cohen
got there, I mean, Frank...

Are you all right, Kirsten?

Please go on.

The first day Frank got
there, Dad and Harry were

Testing some special effects.

Actually, Harry was just
pulling up a lot of dirt.

Stan, I don't think
we're going to use

The dynamite on this one.

Maybe we'll use a flare gun.

I don't know yet.

Now, you can really
see your dad go to work.

Stan, we're ready with the
effects test any time you are.

Let's see it happen.

Stay by the camper for now.

Let's go for it, Harry.

We're hot.

OK, people stand by.

Fire in the hole.

Ready, Sav?

Ready, sweetheart.

Action.

[Flaring sound]

Woo!

What the hell's
going on out here?

Testing some special
effects, Mr. Cohen.

Oh, that stuff.

We do that stuff in the
business all the time.

When I say the business,
I do mean the industry.

How are you and Pops doing?

He doesn't have much time.

I'm thinking maybe
it wasn't such

A great idea coming to see him.

Oh, give him three days.

If he hasn't finished
the movie, I'll fire him.

Then you guys will
have lots of time.

That may be the
only way, Mr. Cohen.

Mr. Cohen was my father.

Please, Kiersty, call me Frank.

I've produced films for
your father for eight years.

Call me Frank.

No one else offers
you that respect.

That's right, Frank.

Oh, Harry.

Harry, I want to talk
to you about some bills

For the effects.

Excuse me, honey.

It's strange that none of us
had any idea what was going on,

Just five miles away.

Let's go, you slimeball.

Ain't got all day.

Come on, mama's boy.

I bet you got to squat to pee.

Now, get up this mountain.

It's a long way down, girls.

All right, boy.

Don't think about it.

Just do it.

Forget about those
assholes up there.

Just... you can do it.

I can't.

I can't do it, man.

You gotta do it.

I can't with all
this shit on me.

What are you doing down
there, boy, whacking your meat?

You gotta do it.

Damn it, Parker, it's
going to be your ass.

These clamps.

I could pull myself up the rope.

Cowardice, gentleman, cannot
be tolerated in any company.

Especially, gentleman,
in the mission

We're presently confronted with.

You've got an attitude
problem, Grasso.

Now if you don't like
what we're doing here,

You can take a walk.

Colonel, I seen firsthand
the need for what

We're doing in Central America.

What I can't swallow is
this bootcamp bullshit.

There's big money in
this supply mission.

I put it together and
we'll do it my way.

That's the trouble
with you, Parker.

Big money.

There's no trouble with money.

Do we understand each other?

Return to the formation.

Your deplorable and
embarrassing behavior earlier,

Which may have
resulted in taking

The life of another soldier,
is deemed insubordinate

By this company and any other.

Do you recognize the punishment?

Do you recognize the punishment?

Yes, sir.

Let this serve as
an example to us all.

Adolescent behavior cannot
and will not be tolerated.

Dismissed.

Cowardice will not be tolerated.

Start walking now.

[Gun shot]

So you stayed on
the set all the time?

At first.

My dad got real busy and
didn't have much time for me.

[Gun shots]

I was so scared.

Why are they doing this?

I don't know, angel.

It's OK.

Daddy's here.

Don't worry.

I'll never let anybody hurt you.

No, Daddy.

Don't leave me.

Help me.

I'll never leave you.

You're my little angel.

Ah, shit.

Cut.

What the hell are you doing?

I'm sorry.

I thought you said cut already.

You guys never let me
get any stills anyways.

And then Frank gets all
over my shit about it.

Send them to lunch.

OK, people, that's lunch.

The next set up will be the
last scene, minus the still

Photographer, thank you.

OK, people that's lunch.

Remember, crew eats first.

One day I got bored and
left the set during lunch.

Oh, it looks like
the brains we blew

Out a guy's head in the last
horror flick I worked on.

No thanks.

Just some salad, please.

Hey, look at that sweet thing.

Shit, I got a better
bike than that at home.

Fuck the bike.

I'm talking about those legs.

Hands off if I were you.

Why, you doing her?

No, she's Sav's.

Sav's?

Bullshit.

I heard he's still
hooked on his ex-wife.

Sav's daughter.

Sav's daughter?

Yeah, that's why I
wouldn't mess with her.

Ah, shit.

How about a ride?

You don't have to be scared.

I'm a safe rider.

Come on, at least sit on it.

It won't bite you.

[Bike fires up]

Oops, my foot slipped.

Bye.

[Bike starts]

We lost track of time
and Rick missed his scene.

Thank you for your
patience, people.

Stand by.

First positions.

First positions.

All tal on the set.

First positions please.

What's the hold up, Booby?

What is taking so long?

Relax, Frank.

How can I relax?

We're three fucking
weeks behind as it is.

This is not the place to
talk about this, Frank.

Stan, what are we waiting on?

Rick.

Rick's not around.

Use someone else.

Fire him.

Frank, you're bothering me.

Stan, let's find him.

Eddie, where's Rick?

He took off.

He'll be back.

Yeah and so will Jesus.

We gotta make a fuckin' movie.

Get someone else.

Frank, please.

Eddie, where is he?

He took off with Kiersty.

They both took off on bikes.

Eddie, take someone and
bring them back now!

I'm making a record of this.

Well, your costing
us a mint, Booby.

So?

So?

Is that all you can say?

So?


We've always made money.

So we're a few weeks
behind on this one.

I'll make it up in
the editing room.

How do you plan to do that?

I wrote it.

I directed it.

I know what to do.

I wish you'd share some
of these secrets with me.

I am the producer.

Hello, hello?

Anybody home, Sav?

Frank, get off my back.

We were just
having a good time.

We had no idea what was going
on, when all of a sudden.

Sweetheart, you're on
government property.

Now, I want you to go back down
there and tell those Hollywood

Faggots that they got 10
minutes to pack up their shit

And get off this property.

You understand me?

Now move!

[Gun shots]

We moved.

Did he specifically
say government property?

I'm almost certain.

Did you give your
dad the message?

Of course.

They shot at us, for God's sake.

Then why didn't you leave?

Mr. Cohen, Frank, said
that he had too much money

Tied up in the film
already and that he

Had every right to be there.

That's when they showed
up the first time.

It was like a nightmare.

Who showed up, Kiersty?

The soldiers.

At least they were
dressed like soldiers.

They had the two
stuntmen that my father

Had sent after me and Rick.

You people have been
ordered to evacuate.

But you refuse.

That's a pity.

[Gun shots]

Daddy!

Hollywood.

Don't be here when I get back.

We're getting the
hell out of here.

I am three weeks behind
and three mil in the hole.

Frank, we got a
dead man over there.

Stuntmen get
killed all the time.

Frank, I'll call the police.

Please, I have to
go to the bathroom.

Dan, go with her.

Damn it.

We should have never let
Parker pick his own people.

Hillary's a documented psycho.

How did Parker to get
him out of the ward

At Washington Memorial?

Certain people
gave him the juice.

Damn it!

You know no matter
what happens, the man

Is not going to be pleased.

Would you be?

The poor kid's
throwing her guts up.

For Christ sakes,
Lauffers, how much longer

Does this have to go on?

As long as it takes, Dunne.

I didn't sign on to hurt kids.

Nobody did.

Now, just calm down.

I'm sorry.

It's all right.

Are you OK?

I'm OK now.

Do you feel like going on?

We can stop if you
don't feel like it.

No.

I'm OK.

I'll be all right now.

Please go on.

It was horrible.

People were screaming
and yelling.

And no one knew what to do.

Somehow my dad got
everyone together

And we started to load up.

Dad told me to start
packing up his trailer.

There was a lot to do.

It took longer than
anyone thought.

Dad, Harry, and I
were in Dad's trailer.

Suddenly, there
was more gun fire.

[Gun shots]

Over here.

I got it.

I got it.

[Rapid gun fire]

Pull out.

Why do you think
he let you live?

I don't know.

OK?

I guess he was more
scared than I was.

I heard his fucking neck snap.

His body just went limp.

You know the second and
third, knife went in so smooth,

I don't even think I hit a bump.

It all went so fast.

I bet they don't even
know what happened.

I felt such power.

I just wa...

That's the way it is
on your first mission.

Look in some poor soul's eyes.

To be able to feel
his total fear.

To know that you
control his destiny.

It's the ultimate rush.

Makes you wonder.

Do you breathe or are you breath
for something much greater?

It's called the
full circle, boy.

You understand?

The full circle.

You live and you die and
hopefully you make your mark.

You live and you die
and you make your mark.

You understand?

You live and you die
and you make your mark.

You understand?

These are innocent people.

What have they done to us?

Their bodies are still warm
and you talk about them

Like their flies on the wall.

Hey.

I wasn't hired to kill people.

I was hired to
try and save them.

These people aren't
harming anyone.

You fucking pussy.

I'm concerned about you, son.

You constantly refer to
the objects of your mission

In the present tense.

I'm not sure I like
the way that sounds.

Did any of you men
witness this soldier's

Performance in battle?

I take it from the
silence, the answer is no.

They're innocent.

They don't have anything
to do with our cause.

They had no reason to die.

And what's wrong with
the rest of you men?

We don't celebrate
after bloodshed.

We mourn.

We wear black.

We don't laugh and drink.

My first mission
assignment, I froze up too.

I saw this poor woman with
this little baby in her arms.

Tears filled my eyes.

I put down my gun.

I couldn't shoot.

I understand how you feel.

Putting a bullet in
someone is very difficult.

And when I saw that little
baby, and that woman,

I couldn't shoot.

I couldn't pull the trigger.

That's why I used the bayonet.

Warm up the vehicles.

It'll be daylight soon.

We've got to terminate
the rest of them.

Our friends from Central
America will be here tonight

To pick up the shipment.

By then, I want those bodies.

Nothing can stand in the
way of this transaction.

There's too much at stake.

Jones, Peters, Davis,
and Stellars, you

Stay here and guard the crates.

The rest of you, let's move out.

All right, you
heard the colonel.

Let's move out!

What did you do then?

We waited until it got dark.

Dad figured our chances
would be better at night.

When we came out, there
were bodies everywhere.

And the cars were all shot up.

Daddy, I was so scared.

Why are they doing this?

Why?

I don't know, my angel.

But don't be scared.

Daddy's here to
take care of you.

Don't worry.

I won't let anyone
ever hurt you.

No, please don't leave.

Hold me.

I'll never leave you.

You're my angel.

I was so scared.

We walked all night.

Did anyone else survive?

We found Rick and Ron,
the sound man once we

Reached this wooded area.

Dad started laying out
some plans to protect us,

Just in case they
came looking for us.

All right, how much of
the blood do we have?

Got about two gallons left.

What else do we have?

I got some great stuff on sound.

I don't know what we can do
with it, but we've got it.

I also grabbed a roll
of wire and a few tools.

Harry.

Most of my supplies
got burned, but I still

Found a few squibs
and a couple low power

Explosives and some rope.

I got some rigging, but
nothing I think we can use.

I don't even know why I took it.

Let's give it a go.

For you two, along the
tree line for three miles,

Work your way down.

OK, now you two,
I want you to do

The same thing along the river.

Hillary, you take these two
men and follow their trail.

I'm going to take the
Jeep and go back to camp.

Keep communications
open every 20 minutes.

If you find them,
I want them myself.

I want to see them die.

Don't worry, angel,
everything will be all right.

Trust me.

I trust you, Daddy.

Excuse us, angel.

What's happening, Sav?

Listen, we've got to move fast.

Maybe we can get lucky.

From this point on,
Harry, you go due north

And continue to leave
a trail of blood.

Ron, you do the
same and go south.

Each of you go for an hour and
then turn 135 degrees due west.

When you meet, go north
another half hour,

Where we'll meet you.

Leave those explosives
and the tools.

Anything here blow
off an arm or a foot?

No, but, you might try these.

Just combine the
red and the blue.

It may not do much damage,
but there's a possibility

F blowing off a toe or two.

That might be all we need.

Set your watches.

It's now 10:00.

I'll see you both at
12:30, God willing.

Be good, Sav.

Good luck, pal.

The red and the blue.

Are you sure you're OK?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Like I said, it's
going to be all right.

Yeah, whatever.

So what are we going to do?

We are going to try
and show those maniacs

That they're not dealing with
some flakes from Hollywood.

Kirsten, take this wire and
stretch it across to that tree.

Rick, take this one to
that tree down there

And fasten it
tight to the trunk.

Come on, Kirsten.

Hey, slow down.

Take it easy.

Let the other guys find them.

What are you talking about?

Let's move.

OK, that tension works good.

Got to tighten this one
up so you bounce, Betty.

OK.

Leave a surprise for these guys.

God, I hope this works.

Me too.

All right, let's move.

It's too hot to run.

So let's go quickly
and try not to stop.

River patrol to Parker.

Come in, Colonel.

This is Parker.

Go ahead, river patrol

No sign of anything.

Any further instructions?

Stay close to the water.

Sooner or later the
heat will get to them

And they'll have
to come in to you.

Copy sir.

Close to the water.

Why are we doing this?

I mean, the way
this pig's bleeding,

He's going to be dead
by the time we find him.

Shit, if it makes
Parker happy, I'm happy.

Fuck it.

Wait.

A wire.

Looks like some kind
of homemade booby.

Recon the area.

All right.

Parker.

Come in, Parker.

This is Parker.

Looks like we got us a
homemade mine here, sir.

Terrific.

Let's see what they got.

Yes, sir.

You ready?

What fucking Hollywood bullshit.

Parker, false
alarm on that mine.

I got meaner farts than that.



Hillary, Hillary, come in.

Fucking shit.

Man, they blew your
fucking foot off, boy.

Shit.

God damn it, Hillary, come in.

Colonel.

Come in, Colonel.

They set us up.

Yeah, there was a second one.

They blew his fucking foot off.

Continue without him.

He's no good to us now anyway.

Is he is great pain?

Yeah, fucking A he is.

Like a horse with a broken leg.

You know what to do, Hillary.

Yes, sir.

Hillary.

Yes, colonel.

I want to hear it.

No!

[Gun shot]

Hillary, please.

Please, Hillary, no.

I want to live, Hillary.

I thought we were friends.

Please.

Jesus Christ.

Mother of God, no.

Hillary, please, Hillary.

Please, Hillary.

Oh, Hillary!

[Gun shot]

Thank you, Hillary.

Now, I want you to get the rest
of those game players soon.

I don't want them
getting too cute.

Do you copy?

Copy colonel.

Do you think our little
surprise did any good?

By the sound we heard,
it did something.

We're not going to make it.

It's all my fault. It's
my fault Frank's dead.

It's my fault all
the others died.

It's my fault
we're going to die.

Stop it, Just shut up.

Grab hold of yourself.

You're not helping matters any.

Rick lost it.

He kept blaming himself
for everyone's death,

Saying that if we hadn't
left the set, none of this

Would have happened.

Daddy and Rick had a fight.

We never saw him again.

You better just
kill me right know.

They're going to kill us anyway.

Water.

I want some water.

We have no water.

Yes, there's a river I know.

It's three miles south.

I'll bring some back.
No!

We stick together until
Ron and Harry get back.

No, I want some water.

[Cry of frustration]

Nothing new to report, sir.

No sign of any of them.

Shall we come back to base?

Do not come near me until
these people are dead.

Do you understand?

Found something.

Hold on sir.

I think we found something.

Looks like more blood, sir.

It appears to be branching
off in two directions there.

Split up and find them.

We're losing light.

Keep me posted.

Out.

You heard the man.

What's your opinion?

[Tape tearing]

This is a squid When in doubt
trigger it, then play dead.

There will be a thump.

But it's better
than the real thing.

Here.

This will protect you too.

Honestly, Dad.

I wanted to spend time with you.

But I never imagined...

Some summer vacation.

What do you think's
going to happen?

Do you know when
you were born, I

Used to go around
to all the neighbors

Telling fantastic stories about
the times we had together.

What do you mean?

When you were a baby,
I told our landlady

At our first apartment that you
read to me when you were a year

Old and walked at five months.

And she'd grab your mother
down in the laundry room

And I'd get caught.

And I'd just say, she walks
and talks only for me.

And to this day, I
still believe you do.

You're still telling
stories today.

Mom says you've never changed.

I haven't.

You see in every
story I tell, there's

A father who loves his
daughter more than anything

Else in the whole world.

Get ready, angel.

The curtain's going up.

Parker to Hillary.

Come in, Hillary.

Yeah, go ahead, Colonel.

Just wanted to let you
know that Stevens might

Be doubling back your way.

Thank you, sir.

This ain't my day.

River patrol to Parker.

You were right.

One of them was thirsty.

Now he swims with the trout.

Parker to ridge platoon.

Do you copy?

This is one half of the
ridge patrol, Colonel.

Move in, then, ridge
patrol Close in tight.

I read you.

Over and out.

Parker to Stevens.

Come in Stevens.

Parker to Stevens.

Come in, Stevens.

Colonel this is Hillary.

Stevens already
knows where they are.

He's got a better
view than any of us.

[Gun shots]

Parker, come in, Parker.

This is Parker.

I've got two of them, sir.

Are you sure, soldier?

I'm standing over their
dead bodies now, sir.

Mr. [inaudible] May he
respectfully rest in peace.

[TAPE PLAYER PLAYING SOUND OF
BATTLE AND REVELE]

[Gun shots]

So Harry killed at least
three of the mercenaries.

Is Harry still alive?

Come on, honey.

I know it's rough.

But we've come this far.

Harry's dead.

He thought we made it.

Sav!

Sav!

We made it!

We got them all!

We did it!

We did it Sav!

We're home free!

[Gun shots]

[Gun shots]

Mission accomplished, sir.

I'm going to be bringing
two back in a cage.

I've had my fun for today.

You're sure Harry's dead?

Yes, he's dead.

Harry's dead.

Ron's dead.

Rick's dead.

Everybody's dead.

Why don't you leave me alone?

It's OK, honey.

Just a couple more questions
and you can get out of here.

I swear no one will
ever bother you again.

They took us back
to their camp.

What exactly did you see there?

Soldiers.

Some of them spoke Spanish.

And a lot of crates.

The soldiers were loading
crates and some kind of powder

Into trucks.

Do you know what
the powder was?

I think it was drugs.

What else did you see?

Dad and I were dragged
inside of the tent,

Where there was a
general from somewhere

In Central or South America.

You see, Colonel
Parker, my people

Would rather pay you in cash
for the help you are giving us.

Business is business.

Now you gave me the
choice of either cash

Or the equivalent
in white powder.

My decision still stands.

There's nothing you can say
that will change my mind.

What to keep me from pulling
out of the deal completely?

What's to keep me from
blowing your brains

All over our fine duck.

Then I keep the cash?

I keep the white powder.

And I take the guns and
I sell them to your enemy

And really make a killing.

That is something you
would never do because deep

Down you believe in our cause.

Just in time, Hillary.

To let our amigo here know how
we really feel about his cause.

You see, this man and this
is a luscious young woman

Almost completely
destroyed our plan today.

Had they succeeded, all
your little fighters

Would have died without any
chance to defend themselves.

What does this man do?

He takes what we do for
real and glorifies it

For the screen.

He makes movies.

You know, there are a lot
of problems in this world.

And I'm one of them.

You know the value
of this shipment

Far exceeds any
budget you'd ever have

For one of your cinematic lies.

But you gave us
good sport today.

So do you have any
final requests?

Any last words?

[Gun cocks]

Is there anyone you'd
like to say goodbye to?

Our Father, Who art in Heaven.

Hallowed be Thy name.

Thy kingdom come.

Thy will be done.

On Earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

As we forgive those who
trespass against us.

[Gun shot from outside]

Why don't you just go
ahead and kill us now.

I am a freedom fighter.

I do what I do for peace.

There is a Jeep out back.

You are free to go.

[Gun shot]

Hillary, they got away.

Take the men and go after them.

You're not leaving,
are you, General?

Hey, Lee.

Look at that shit.

Where do you want to
start to kick some ass?

What are you doing?

I don't know!

[Gun shots]


[Scraping, squealing sound]

[Glass shattering]

Fuck!

[Gun cocks]

[Trigger clicks]

[Gun cocks]

[Trigger clicks]


[Trigger clicks]


Yes, I know.

[Gun shot]

To you, Colonel.

Daddy.


Please don't leave me.

Daddy.


All he ever wanted
to do was make

Movies that made people laugh.

Can I go now?

I've told you everything.

Sure, honey.

Me and Mr. Dunne will
take you home now.

Your father would be
real proud of you.

Make sure all loose
ends are tied up.

This job sucks.

This is Stewart.

Put me through to him.

I'll be in Washington
in the morning, sir.

Yes, sir.

There's a company jet
waiting for me now.

The film is secure.

The girl was the only survivor.

The company is tying
up all loose ends

Left by Colonel Parker.

You'll have a full
report in the Oval Office

In the morning, sir.

Thank you, sir.

[Music playing]
