You're not doing as you're told.

The American is small and weak...

Weak.

How can you do this?

He's nothing... soft!!

He fights like a beast. How's my eye?

He's not human...

He's like a piece of iron.

You trained this fool. He's a disgrace.

Listen to them...

Our people cheer for HIM! ... You idiot.

WIN!

I fight to win!

For me!

For me!
