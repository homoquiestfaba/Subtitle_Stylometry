Karl!

Hello.

Hi.

Back!

Oh, what's the matter Karl?

Forget your umbrella?

Karl, Karl, Karl.

I told you

to stop coming by here.
This is our street.

Yeah! This is our street.

I live here too.

Hey Karl,

what does breast milk
taste like when you are 16?

Karl, is that you?

Karl!

Hey Mom.

Karl, I told you
to avoid those kids

now you're just gonna have to find
another way to go home.

They're just kids

'Mom'.
I can handle it.

Don't worry.

Come here.

Mom.

Come here!

You still going out tonight?

Yep.

It's a, little itchy, but

I don't mind.

Yes I suppose it is
hard to maintain, but

well,

you tell me if it's worth it.

Hello, this is
Karl Mulberry, reporting live

for the weather service.

My moustache?

Oh yes it is real.

It's hilarious.

Thank you so much.

You know you really
didn't have to do this.

Oh, it's no trouble at all.

Oh, Karl!

I didn't realize you were home.

Frank, this is Karl.
Karl, this is Frank Salt.

Colonel, Frank Salt.

Oh,

right.

You know son
when a man extends his hand

it's usually considered
polite to shake it.

Now if you were to pull a stunt
like that in the army

you might lose your own hand.

Tactical blade,

nice and neat.

He seemed nice, didn't he?

Hey,

did dad

have a moustache
when you first met him?

Yeah.

Yeah your father had
a moustache as long I knew him.

Mom,

how do I look?

All right, very handsome.

Let it rain!

He was standing there staring

and then she looked him
right in the eye and said:

Mister!

You put that right back
where you found it!

Oh Frank, she didn't say that.

She did too.

Karl.

Hey Karl,
what happened to you?

Oh, some,

some neighborhood bullies
have been picking on Karl.

Mom!

But if he would just avoid them

then this wouldn't be a problem.

Bullies?

Are they still out there?

'cause I know a little
something about warfare.

If you want to

we can get us a barrel of oil
and grab some matches!

What are you even doing here?

Oh, well your mom left

one of her earrings
at the store and I just...

Yeah.

I just brought it back to her.

And I invited Frank
to stay for dinner.

So Karl, your mom tells me to 
you're a...

heck of a rollerblader.

You have any other hobbies?

Nope.

When I was in the army,
I...got me an accordion.

Not much to look at,
but a great sound.

Has my mom
told you about my dad?

Oh, ah.

Thatâ€™s the man.

Oh yeah,

I can see where you
get your good looks.

What happened to him?

He was in the weather service.

No!

Gerald! This feels like
a Gerald to me.

Hold on

wait!

Hello!

It was his job
to name all the hurricanes.

Wow!

Well that is really cool Karl.

You think it...

it's really cool
that my dad died?

Karl!?

No.

That's, kind of
a rude thing to say.

No, I just meant,

you should be very proud Karl

of the work your father did.

I'm sorry.

No-no-no, itâ€™s not you.

He's been a little
moody lately thatâ€™s all.

When I was in the army

I, got me an accordion.

I, got me an accordion.

I, got me an accordion.

No way!

Oh, hey!

Is that you Karl?

I thought that was
your mom's room!

Frank?

Is that you?

Karl?

Oh, hey mom.

Almost ready.

Karl, there's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

Mom, I already told you,

I thought he was a burglar.

Oh, well,

even so,
you should know who your

throwing rollerblades at
before you throw them.

Jeez mom, I was just trying
to protect the house!

What's the problem?

Karl, I don't want you
to feel threatened.

I hope you know that,

Frank is not here
to replace your father.

Yeah I know.

And there is 'no way'
he could ever replace you.

He is not nearly
as handsome as my son.

Is that,

perfume you're wearing?

All set?

All set for what?

Would you mind if Frank
takes me dancing tonight?

But it's Friday.

Hey Karl, you're welcome
to come with us if you want too.

I don't want you to think
that I resent that whole

rollerblade thing
you know, heck.

I've been shot
in the head before!

You have?
Yes.

Well..., what,
what do you think Karl?

Do, you wanna join us?

Really, I don't mind sharing her!

I tell you what sweetie,

take this!

Okay? And you get
any kind of food you want.

And call me if you
need anything, all right?

I'll have her home before bedtime.

Okay.

Be good!

I don't know how you do it
in high heels though because,

my dogs are barking right now.

Well so are mine

because you were stepping
on them all evening.

Well that's because
I'm a work in progress.

Oh, okay.

Oh.

What?

Oh no.

Well now
what are we going to do?

Well I'm hoping
you know how to change a tire.

Me?

No, there's nothing to it.

You got to have the right tools.

Not much you can do
with the electrics

at least you can change
your tire when you need to.

What in the world!

Okay!

All right, that's funny.

Frank?

Oh, well, that is just a gag.

I mean, it's it, th..., this is.

what the... I don't even know.

What do you do
with something like that?

So what?

Mister Wonderful didn't want
to stay the night?

Well, I don't think we're
gonna be seeing

very much of Frank anymore.

How come?

Let's just say ...,

he wasn't the man
that I thought he was.

Oh,

I'm sorry mom.

It's okay.

I guess it's just
you and me, Karl.

As long we have each other
we're gonna be okay.

Hey, Karl.

I don't think my mom
wants to talk to you.

Oh that's... that's all right

I just want to drop something off.

She ...,

she might want to think
about getting a new

pair of earrings.

That one doesn't seem
to want to stay in.

All right I'll ... .

Well, itâ€™s good to see you Karl.

Tell your mom I said 'hi'?

Frank wait!

You saw me.

Why didn't you say anything?

I don't know, I.

Guess I tried to put myself
in your skates and I,

I guess if I was you
I'd have done the same thing.

You would?

Oh sure.

You were just looking out
for the woman you love.

That's what
every man should do.

Karl, what's wrong?

I donâ€™t know, I just, I

I put the stuff in Frank's car.

I'm sorry.

Why would you do
something like that?

I was just,

worried, that I lose you.

Oh, Karl.

Nice to see you again

Karl.

We are going to try
something new today.

Water was getting boring!

You wanna guess, whatâ€™s inside?

It's not lemonade!

It's human lemonade.

Any last words,

Karl?

Yes!

Now.

We got peed on!

Hi girls!

There he is!

Watch your flight, girl!
Watch your flight!

It's clear! It's clear!

Get away from me.

How does it feel girls?

You're a crazy old man!

What did we ever do to you?

Oh no! Throw it away!

Letâ€™s be friends!

The End
