OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Dispatch, this is unit 48.

We are investigating
a possible 261.

Location is approximately
three blocks south

Of Wilshire on Carrillo.

Over.

DISPATCHER (ON
RADIO): Copy that, 48.

Do you have a positive ID?

Over.

OFFICER (ON RADIO): Dispatch,
that is an affirmative

On the identification.

Repeat, we have a positive ID.

The victim looks
to be Tina Mason.

DISPATCHER (ON RADIO):
Oh, 48, could you

Repeat again the victim's ID?

Did you say Tina Mason?

Over.

OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Copy that, dispatch.

No bullshit.

Looks to be Jack Mason's
little girl, Tina.

DISPATCHER (ON
RADIO): Thank you, 48.

Jesus Christ.

OFFICER (ON RADIO): Roger that.

The victim's body appears to
have been sexually assaulted.

The DC has indicated
that the cause of death

May be due to stab wounds
on the lower abdomen.

Shit, has someone told
Jack yet or Jennifer?

Over.

DISPATCHER (ON RADIO):
Uh, that's a yes, 48.

Both Detectives
Jack and Jennifer

Mason have been notified.

Over.

OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Copy that, dispatch.

We have no suspects
at this time.

We're releasing the body
to the medical examiner.

Man, sometimes I hate this job.

Over.

DISPATCHER (ON
RADIO): Roger, 48.

I couldn't agree more.

Over.

JACK: Thou shalt not kill.

Generally, a pretty
good rule to live by.

But last year, my daughter
was raped and murdered.

We never found the
guy who did it.

Thou shalt not kill.

Today, I believe there are
exceptions to that rule.

Today, I believe there are
some things worse than death.

Not knowing is one of them.

Not knowing how
afraid she must've

Been, not knowing
who killed her.

Yes, there are some
things worse than death.

Oh, fuck me.

Oh.

Oh.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

Fuck me.

Oh, yeah.

Oh.
Oh, yeah.

Fuck me.

Come on.

Oh, baby, yeah.

Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

There's someone here.
Oh.

What the fuck are you doing?

What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

Fuck you.
No, thanks.

I'm working.

Hey, man.
Fuck off.

Shut up.

I'll only say it once, Manuelo.

Toss me the shit and tell
me the name of your boss.

Are you a fucking cop?

No, I'm from the
"Love Connection."

I want to know how your
dream date is going.

Now toss me the shit
and start talking.

Watch yourself, dick face.

Fuck you, man.

Fuck who?

Hey, I'm not
fucking joking, man.

Would you excuse us, please?

Now.

Fuck.

Fuck who, huh?

Fuck who?

Alfredo Marquez.

That's who you want.

Alfredo Marquez.

Afraid it was that cocksucker.

You'll live.

Sign, please.

What's that?

It's your signed testimony
that Alfredo Marquez

Is your shit distributor.

I'll see that you get a copy,
along with your attorney.

Sign it.
Sign it!

So who was the girl, huh?

Who's the girl?

Marquez sent her.

She gives me the stuff.

And the free fuck is
a fringe benefit, huh?

You're a bad guy, Manuelo.

You know that?

A bad fucking guy.

You're a drug pusher,
and you're a rapist.

Yeah.

I know, a rapist.

A little girl, last
year, seven years old.

She died.

They let you off.

Circumstantial evidence,
they called it,

A fucking technicality.

It's a neat term.

I hate that fucking term.

Sometimes I take the shit.

I go nuts.

I didn't mean to hurt her.

Are you gonna make
me sign for that too?

Suppose I don't.

Would you testify in a court?

Shit.

No fucking way.

What's the term you're
fucked mean to you?

Coming from a
rat turd like you?

Tell me.

Fuck.

Get him, you fucking asshole.

You want me to sign something?

Fucker.

Get his ass.

Kill him.

You are dead, motherfucker.

I got your ass.

Kill him.


Kill him!


Come here.

You are dead, motherfucker.

Now.

[Gun clicks]

No!

[Gun clicking]

You missed.


No!

You lose, fuck face.

No!


Hey, Milton.

Looking for someone?

You know, one day, I'm
going to end up shooting you.

That'll be the day.

By the way, you smell.

I can shower.

Good idea.


That wasn't making love.

That was fucking to forget.

You still love her, don't you?

Who?

You know who.

Your wife.

Ex-wife.

And I never see her.

I saw her today.

She was down at Central.

She's been made
detective over the 21st.

Homicide.

And she's been put on psych
evaluation, just like you.

Psych evaluation?

Those fuckers.

Of course they'd put
us on psych evaluation.

They got no pity.

Crazy cops.

Psych evaluation.

I guess no one can have a
shitty year in general anymore.

Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em.

Fuck 'em.

Fuck 'em.

Jack.

Oh, Jack.

Oh, Jack.

Bad day too, huh?

The worst.

Come here, you fucking
bitch, you little minx,

You little slut.

Come to daddy.

Come on.

Bring that black clad
leather ass over here.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

You minx.

You slut.

Oh, that's right.

That's right.


Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.


DOCTOR: I can do
this for you, Jack.

I need an official
identification, Jack.

Yes, this is my daughter.

Did she die quickly?

DOCTOR: We finished
posting her an hour ago.

She was raped and sodomized.

The abdominal perforations
are from some kind of tool,

A screwdriver maybe.

How long?

Five hours.

Maybe more.


PHIL: Sorry to get you
up at this hour, buddy.

Oh, it's OK.

I was sleeping shitty anyway.

Yeah, I thought you might
want to be in on this.

A lady called a little while
ago, said she heard screaming.

Hmm.

Let me guess.

We're the first ones here?

Yup.

God, I hate these.

OK.

Call it.

Heads.

Tails.

I win.

Lucky you.

Lucky me.

One.

Two.

Three.

This place is a fucking mess.

That room.

Got it.

Talk to me, Phil.
What do we have?

PHIL: We need some backup.

Move it, move it.

WOMAN: Freeze.

Don't turn around.

[Speaking spanish]

Hey, Jack.

Oh, you look like shit.

I feel like shit.

Thanks for playing.

What the fuck do
we have in there?

Well, we got a
boy without a bat.

Yeah.

I'll never eat hot dogs again.

Is this going to make me sick?

As a dog.

OK.

SGT. BILLY: It
looks like they've

Done the poor fuck in the
bathroom, right about here.

Shit.

He must have put up a hell of
a struggle before he went down.

I see a penny.

JACK: Pick it up.

And all day, you
will have good luck.

Silencer cap, no
fragmentation, .38 caliber.

As pro as it comes, gentlemen.

Vengeance is mine.

So sayeth the Lord.

Real poetry.

Yeah, real poetry.

Hey, uh, Jack.

Do you remember the
movie "Deliverance"?

Yeah.

Why?

Well, I said it was Ned Beatty
that got the dick of death

From the country fuck
with the bad teeth.

Phil thinks it was John Voight.

It was Voight.

SGT. BILLY: No fucking way, man.

It was Ned who got butt hosed.

What the fuck is this?

It was Ned Beatty, OK?

Bullshit.
No bullshit.

Would you pay the man?

It was Ned.

Stan, where the hell are you?

I need stats on this.

Stan's outside.

Where the fuck is he?

He just was behind me.

He's checking in
with pathology.

I got the stats.

Let's hear them, Bob.

Driver's license
and a full wallet.

$10.54 in change.

Had a prior on him just now.

Adams, Jason R, age
32, blood type, O plus,

Worked for the phone company.

That explains everything.

And the stats show
he was arrested

And indicted but
conviction for the rape

Of a 12-year-old girl in 1991.

The case was
dismissed due to lack

Of evidence, failure of
witness to appear and testify.

Other than that, he's
clean as a whistle.

This guy is carved
like a damn turkey.

Shooter saved us the
family jewels, though.

Mean piece of castration.

Get that shit out of here.

We had her, Phil.

Goddamn it, we had her.

Wrong, pal.

She almost had you.


Hello, Jenny.

What are you doing here?

Hey, Phil.

Jenny.

Still trying to
strangle rape suspects?

When they let me.

Oh.

Well, I wanted to
come and see where

The legendary Jack
Mason held his high noon

With his squad of scum bags.

Mm-hmm.

What are you doing here?

Ask Jack.

Shooting the Taurus
instead of the .38, huh?

Well, we came to
congratulate you, Jenny?

We heard you made Homicide.

21st.

Yup.

And I heard that you're
sleeping with someone in Rape

Down at Central.

Trish Anderson's
her name, I believe.

She's just a friend.

Obviously.

Are you still a
shitty shot, Jack?

After you.

I hate cans.

And Trish is just trying to help
us find leads to Tina's killer.

She's trying to help.

Well, I don't know
how to thank her.

I'll leave that to you.

Nice shot, Jack.

Phil, fuck you.

Oh, yeah.

Ooh, right there.

[Stabbing sound]



Why?

WOMAN: Because you deserve it.

No!

No!


STEVE: Mind if I
get a print on this?

No.
Go on, Steve.

It looks pretty goddamned ugly.

Left and right eye, potassium
vitreous humour consumer.

LNR, VH, check.

Time is 11:36.

SGT. BILLY: [inaudible] took an
ax and gave a penis 40 whacks.

Yeah, we found some hair fibers
from the Hollywood location

Last night.

Got them analyzed
about 10 minutes ago.

We got a blonde and a brunette.

It looks like we're dealing
with two shooters, not one.

Well, they could
be working together,

Like those hookers two years
ago that worked as a team

With the johns.

They get a threesome going
and then rob him at gunpoint.

Yeah, but these
two are flashier.

They tie the poor bastards
up, slice up Mr. Happy,

Then turn out the
lights with a .38.

Sounds like what
my wife does to me.

PHIL: Yours too?

Or our perp could be male.

The hair follicles
found at the other scene

Could belong to anyone,
girlfriend, housekeeper, maybe

Even his mother.

It proves nothing,
except that we have hair.

Our perp is female.

Just what the hell are
you doing here, Jenny?

This is my jurisdiction,
shared with Central, of course.

Good day, gentlemen.

Boy, Thanksgiving at their
house must be a bitch.

No shit.

I don't want you on this case.

I'm not asking your permission.

Still pissed at me, aren't you?

No, Jack.

I'm pissed in general.

I'm trying to get
my life back, and I

Can do that by doing my job.

So let me.

Shit.

It looks like we've got
ourselves a serial case here.

Yeah, it looks like it.

Listen, do me a
favor, would you?

I want you to ID
this guy, and I want

You to check for any priors,
rape specifically or attempted.

Jack, what do I
look like, a blonde

With big tits and a sign on top
of my head that says fuck me,

I'm dumb?

I do this for a
living, remember?

I know.
I'm sorry.

Man, you get
around your ex-wife,

And your brains turn to shit.

Yeah.

This department has enough
of a bad rap, dick head,

And you're not helping it.

Something on your mind, Billy?

Yeah.

I read the report last
night for Manuelo Carrera.

It sucks.

I think you shot the
fucker a couple of times

And got a confession out of him.

You got all that
from my report, huh?

Come on, Jack.

I read ME's autopsy.

What the fuck you
doing out there?

My job, Bill.

Oh, yeah?

Well, shit runs downhill.

And your guerrilla tactics
ain't helping us any.

You know, you've been an ass
ever since your kid kicked,

And your wife left you.

Funny guy.

Fuck you, man?
What the fuck are you doing?

Fuck you.

Get the fuck outta here.

Fuck you.

Lay off.

Your partner's a psycho case.

Fuck you, man.

Get the fuck out.


You're an asshole, Jack.

He's going to get
you killed one day.

You can bet on it, asshole.

You know something, Billy?

What?

The day I bite
it... that's going

To be the day Jack isn't there.

Get the fuck outta here.

Don't let Billy get to you.

Besides, we got our second ID.

Callister, Raymond B. He
works part time as a bartender

At the Shark's Cove.

I made a call to
the joint yesterday

And talked to the owner.

He said Callister left at 2:00
in the morning with a woman.

Uh-huh.

Well, it's a start, isn't it?

I also talked to your
new girlfriend in Rape.

What's her name?

Trish.

Yeah, Trish.

Pretty.

Anyway, this guy Callister, two
for two on a rape prior, 1991.

Same story as the first victim.

Released due to insufficient
evidence and a no-show

By the alleged victim.

A few minor misdemeanors since
'91, but other than that,

Nothing to get a hard-on for.

Let's pay the Shark's
Cove a little visit.

Yeah.

Anyway, Trish wanted to see you.

She wouldn't let me
give you a message.

Where's Trish?

She's in the lady's.

She'll be back in a second.

Can I say something, Jack?

Sure, Susan.

Shoot.

I know you and
Trish are involved.

She loves you.

You know, it may be
a cheap fuck for you,

But it means more to her.


Hi.

Hi.

You know Susan just gave
me the Bill of Rights?

I don't treat you
good, and I'm dog meat.

She's protective.

Yeah, like a pit bull.

I wanted to show you something.

Here's the list that you
wanted on your two victims.

OK.

Both arrested on
rape two months ago.

Both released on
insufficient evidence

And/or failure of appearance
by alleged victim to testify.

Pretty standard.

Well, it's some kind
of pattern, at least.

You're thinking this
mad woman is going

Around hunting these guys down?

Why not?

The trick is to see
who she hits next.

Well, out of 36
non-convictions and releases,

16 have been
re-incarcerated, eight

Show as being unaccounted for,
and two of course are dead.

That's two, four, six.

That leaves 10 that our shooter
might be able to track down.

True.

Only if she had this file.

Well, who has access to it?

Cops.

Cops.

Adams and Callister
were hit last night,

Both killed in
alphabetical order.

You know, I'm
having a tough time

Believing that our killer is
hitting these guys like that.

I'm having a tough enough
time buying the fact

That our perp may be a cop.

Me too.

You know, if we are
dealing with a cop,

We're dealing with a
very twisted sister.

You hear?

Yeah.

Evening, boys.

We got a $5 cover, and the
girls don't like to be touched.

Looks like your
kind of place, Jack.

Yeah, and the
girls look fragile.

Thank you, sir.


They look sweet.

I'll bet you have nine inches
of red, hot, pussy-loving dick.

Make that 12 inches...
From the floor up.


And what about you, blanco?

You look like a sad man.

I can make you happy for $40.

$40, huh?

Mm-hmm.

Do you play?

Yeah, I play.

You play with Manawa, you lose.

But I'll tell you what.

For another $40, I can show you
my favorite game in the back.

In the back, huh?

I have an idea.

Let's play with a
little white ball here.

You win, you win $40.

You lose, you still win $20.

Deal?

I like you, blanquito.

She likes me.

Maybe you and I could
be friends one day, huh?

Maybe.

Gentlemen, any special
services I can offer you.

Yeah, maybe.

Do you know Raymond Callister?

Yeah.

He's our bartender.

He works part time for me.

Actually, he was supposed
to come in tonight.

Well, that would be
a little difficult.

Why's that?

JACK: Because he's dead.

That's why.

We thought you might
be of some help.

You are, uh,
friends of Callister?

Did he leave anything here?

Yeah, behind the bar.

He left a duffel
bag here last night.

[Speaking spanish]

JACK: You got a nice little
place here, Mister, um...

Tyreen.


I own it.

Oh, you own it?

Well, that's really
bloody interesting.

You know most of your customers
here are snorting cocaine

Like there's no tomorrow?

That's against the
law here in America.

It's a pity if a couple
of cops would see that.

I don't like threats.

Get them.

Behind you.

What happened to
our friendship?

Fuck you, asshole.

Back off.

Back up.

You're my bitch.

You're my bitch!

Shut the fuck up.

You back off too.

No, pal.

He's my bitch.

Get the fuck outta here.

Get outta here.
Get out the door, both of you.

Come on.

Now.

Kneel.

Kneel!

You fuckers.

You always this friendly, man?

No.

Usually I'm a real cocksucker,
but you caught me on a good day

Today.

Tyreen, I want you to look
at this piece of paper, OK?

Phil, open that.

I want you to tell
me if you recognize

Any of the names on that list?

No.

No one.

Just Callister.

You told me that Callister
left here last night

Around 2:00 in the morning.

Is that correct?

Yeah, about that time.

Was he alone?

No.

Who did he go with?

A woman.

Describe her.

She was young, pretty,
nice tits, a great ass, man.

I even offered her a job.

What did she say?

She laughed.

She said she already got a job.

She said, would you
believe I'm a cop?

A cop?

You know, Phil, if you were a
woman in a pit like that, faced

With a slime ball like
Tyreen offering you a job,

Would you be saying,
no thanks, I'm a cop?

You know, that does
sound a little strange.

You know, it was
one year, two nights

Ago that Tina was found dead.

Same night as the first murder.

Coincidence.

That's all I'm going to say.

Coincidence.

I wonder.

[Engine starts]

You're late, Jack.

Yeah, well, I just want you
to know I feel great and really

Love the miracle of life.

Well, that sounds to
me like a crock of shit.

Yeah, well, would you
just sign the paper

Where it says I love my inner
child and jerk off regularly.

Then Meadows will stop
goosing me every two minutes.

Jack, word has it you're
getting laid these days.

You reading the
bathroom walls again?

I don't need to.

What is this?

Straight from the Commissioner.

He wants your psych sessions
to be taken jointly.

And frankly, I don't
think it's a bad idea.

Aw, fuck.

Shit.

Oh, good.

We're in mutual agreement.

David, let me put
it real simply, OK?

A year ago, someone raped
and murdered my daughter.

Now the best thing I
can do is stay working.

Me sitting here and
listening to my ex-wife

Tell me it was my fault
isn't going to help.

Don't lay a guilt trip on me
for you screwing up at work.

It was my daughter too.

Fine.

This is bullshit.

Jack.

Jack.

Doc, he's stressed.

So am I. Do you blame us?

No, I guess not.

LT. MEADOWS: All right.

Let's hear what we have.

What we don't have,
Lieutenant, is shit.

All right.

Why don't we go into specifics?

OK.

Two victims, both within a
12 hour period, both male,

Both found naked with multiple
lacerations of the stomach

And torso and a single
fatal gunshot wound

To the head or torso.

According to the
coroner's report,

The genitalia of both victims
were removed prior to death.

We have no witnesses,
no fingerprints, at least

None that corroborate with
existing computer records.

Oh, and by the way,
we have no suspects.

And nothing on the mystery
lady that whacked you, Jack?

JACK: Like the man said,
we don't have shit.

Ostensibly, our
shooter is female.

Ah, Detective Mason.
Good.

Thank you.

Please have a seat right here.

I've asked Dr. Wilson to
sit in with us on this one,

And Detective Mason is
part of a joint effort

Of the 21st in our precinct
to resolve this matter.

I object to Detective Mason's
involvement on this case.

On what grounds, Jack?

On the grounds that she is
psychologically unprepared

To be involved in a
case of this nature.

Well, due to the nature of
this case, as you put it,

Jack, are you any more
prepared to be involved?

Oh, come on.

Detective Mason
and Detective Mason,

I appreciate the personal
difficulties in your lives

At the moment.

This forum is not the
place to air them.

If, however, either one of you
feels that your past tragedy

In any way adversely affects
the prosecution of this case,

Let me know now, and
you'll be relieved

Of any further
responsibility to it.

Look, I've got a
partner on this already.

I understand that, Jack.

Jennifer is a liaison
between the 21st precinct

And ours on this case.

And you'll be her
primary contact, Jack.

Now Dr. Wilson, you've
read the preliminary file

On these killings.

Any comments?

Well, we're obviously
dealing with a

Paranoid psychotic personality.

The homicidal
tendencies are clearly

Combined with a psychosexual
hatred of everything male.

Now, if our killer is
selecting his victims...

His or her victims...
Randomly, we've

Got our job cut out for us.

Well, what if the
murders are revenge based?

It cuts down our
field of probabilities.

Look, look.

What we have to establish is
a motive and a commonality

Between the victims.

Well, gee, that sounds simple.

Lady and gentlemen,
let's get to work.

How dare you put
me down like that?

I told you.

This is my job.

Your job to worm yourself
back into this precinct

Again and make our lives
more miserable than they

Already are?

What is that supposed to mean?

It means, Jane, that we
damn near destroyed ourselves

Last year after Tina died.

And we wisely broke up.

Why are you doing this?

I didn't ask to be here.

You can blame our
shrinks for that.

Fine, I'll do that.

But you and I have
an understanding, OK?

You communicate through
channels only with me.

Got it?

Agreed.

Jack.

JACK: Excuse us.

Look, you're not the only one.

I keep hearing her talk to
that stupid pigeon of yours.

Milton, cuckoo.

I love you.

Milton, cuckoo.

I love you, Milton.

Cuckoo.

What I mean is I miss her too.


Good girl.

I think you found a new friend.

Yeah.

I'll take all I can get.

You know, it's been a while
since you've come around here,

Jack.

I'm sorry, Gwen.

Listen, this was
a hell of a meal.

Thanks.

Yeah, and you're
a hell of a dog.

She ate more than you did, pal.

She's made like a damn horse.

You know, when I was
first dating her,

All she did was
eat like a rabbit.

But now a year later, I've
married a longshoreman.

I heard that, buddy.

You're up shit creek now, pal.

You calling me a pig?

Well, pigs don't eat that much.

Oh, well, this
little piggy thinks

That maybe you'd just like
a little whipped cream

On your face.

You deserved that, pal.

PHIL: What are you doing?

What do you think you're doing?

I can't believe you.

Oh.
Oh.

Help me, Jack.
Help me.

He's killing me.
Sorry, Gwen.

GWEN: Stop.

Stop.

I don't think is
good for the baby.

Stop.
Wait, wait.

What'd you say?

Baby?

Is it a boy or a girl?

Why didn't you tell me this?

I...

PHIL: I'm sorry
about that pig crack.

GWEN: No, no.
It's not...

PHIL: You shouldn't be working.
A baby...

GWEN: I'm fine.


Ow, ow, ow.

Stop it.

Stop it.

Ow.

Oh, I'm going to get you.

I'm going to get you.

I'm going to get you now.

I'm going to get you.

I'm going to get mommy as well.

PHIL: We're pregnant, Jack.

A toast.

Cheers.

Cheers.

OK.

Let us assume that our
killer is being systematic.

J Donaldson is next after
Callister, then N Ford.

I think I'll pay a little
visit to Donaldson.

Why don't you snag Ford?

Yeah.

M Jefferson is next,
and then B Kelly.

There's a few in between,
but no addresses.

OK.

I'll take Jefferson too.

Why don't you make
some calls on Kelly?

You go on ahead, buddy.

I got me some celebrating to do.

Honey, if anything
ever happened to me...

What are you talking about?

I mean, if anything
ever did, do me a favor.

Go to Jack.

He'll take care of you.

Nothing is going
to happen to you.

You are going to be a daddy.

Nothing's going
to happen to you.

You got that, pal?

OK.

Yeah.

Me, a dad.

A daddy.

Donaldson,
Donaldson, Donaldson.


Open up.

Open up in there.

Goddamn it, open up.

Open... back up, motherfucker.

Back up.

Hands in the air.

Hands in the air.
Drop it.

Drop it.
Shut up.

What the fuck do you want, man?

Who's the fucking girl?

Who is she?

She's my goddamn wife.
You got a problem with that?

Why was she screaming, huh?
Why?

Man, I always make
my women scream.

You got a problem with that?

I'm a cop.

I heard screaming, goddammit.

Oh, you're a motherfucking cop.

Where's your search
warrant, pig?

Huh?

Look, I don't have a warrant.

I'm sorry about all this.

Eat me.

I pay my goddamn
taxes, you fucking pig.

You got a badge number?

Motherfucker.

JACK: This is my fault, OK?

Fuck you.

Get the fuck out of here.

Yeah, get out of
here, you fucking pig.

WOMAN: Asshole.

Fuck you.

Ford got married
two months ago.

The addresses is bogus.

The guy left town,
according to the neighbors.

Kelly was evicted
five months ago.

No one has a clue where he is.

Which means neither
does our shooter.

PHIL (ON PHONE): Copy that.

Who's next on the list?

Yeah.

Munsen, R and
Ellis, K. Munsen is

At a warehouse on 404 South 3rd,
and Ellis is 206 Pico, both LA.

My, this is fun.

How did Jefferson work out?

JACK (ON PHONE): Well, I'm
off to see Jefferson now.

You know, we can't exclude
Donaldson as a target

Just because he's married.

Yeah, I know, Phil.

But I have the feeling
that our lady is going

After single targets only.

A gut hunch?

Yeah.

Another gut hunch.

I'll talk to you.

Son of a bitch.

[Horn honking]

Damn, what's the matter
with you, you asshole?

I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

Jesus Christ.

You goddamned near killed me.

Can't you watch where you going?
Son of a bitch.

I'm sorry.
You goddamned near kill me.

I'm sorry.

You fucking asshole.

Watch where you're going.

I'm sorry.

WOMAN: Freeze.

Turn around, slowly.

Oh, Jack.

What are you doing here?

I might ask you the
same question, Jen.

The same thing
as you, obviously.

Obviously.

I saw her.

Who?

You know who.

She clobbered me 10
minutes ago again.

I couldn't see her face, but
I saw what she was wearing

And what color her hair was.

What color was it?

Your color, and she was
dressed just like you.

You think it was me?

I don't know.

I chased her.

I lost her five
minutes from here.

It's conceivable you could have
circled around and come back.

Yes.

Why would I come back?

You tell me, Jenny.

This is crazy, Jack.

You know that.

Jesus Christ.

I'm a cop.

Yeah.

I know, Jenny.

Jack giving you a hard time?

Jack always gives
me a hard time.

Thank you, gents.

Mm-hmm.

We found the car.

You were right.

No plates, no paperwork.

I'll check stolens too.

We got the, uh... the stiff
wanted to [inaudible].

You guys need anything else?

No, thanks.

I want to see the
postmortem report.

You got it.
Yeah.

I'll be outside if you need me.

Thanks, Billy.

Oh, and, uh, watch
yourself with Meadows.

He's got a real
stick up his ass.

What else is new?

Thank you for everything.

Sure.
Anything I can do, let me know.

Thanks.

Think she told Meadows
about your little list?

I think we're
about to find out.

It's number three, gentlemen.

And we're getting ripped
to shit by the press.

In other words, Metro's
finest ain't looking too good.

Lieutenant, mind if I ask
what you and Detective Mason

Were talking about earlier?

As a matter of fact, she asked
to be removed from this case.

May I ask why?

She felt that there were too
many issues in her own life

To make it impossible
for her to continue

With this
investigation properly.

Find this psycho, bitch boys.

Three dickless corpses in 24
hours gets me in a bad mood.

She didn't mention your list.

No, she didn't, Phil.

What are you doing here?

I live here, Jack.

Hi, Jack.

Um, Susan wants to
apologize for the other day.

Don't you, Susan?

No hard feelings, Jack?

Since when have you
become so tight with her?

Since about 27 years ago.

Susan's my sister.

Your sister?

She kept her married name.

Uh-huh.

Where's her husband?

They're separated.

She moved in here.

I owed her that.

Susan's the reason I'm a cop.

She got me into the auxiliary
and then the academy.

So you better be nice to
me, or my big sister's

Going to beat you up.

What's wrong, Jack?

It's my wife.

My ex-wife, Jenny.

Do you remember Jefferson, one
of the bad guys on your list?

Well, I found him dead
today, and Jenny was there.

And I'm starting to think that
maybe Jenny is... I'm thinking

That maybe she's one of...

Drink this.

Thanks.

That felt like an exorcism.

Sorry.

Don't be.

I felt needed.

It's kind of like love.

Where are you going?

I've got work, honey.

Right.

Get laid and leave.

Come on.

Don't do that.

Honey, what the
hell are you doing?

Look, I don't have
time for... Trish.

Don't touch.


PHIL: Have you heard
of psittacosis?

Pigeon shit disease.

The shit dries through.

It's a dust.

You breathe it in.

It sticks to your lungs.

You're one dead motherfucker.

Psittacosis.
Oh, psittacosis.

Yeah, I'll remember that one.

PHIL: Lose the bird, Jack.

That's my advice.

Milton, cuckoo.

I love you.

I can't do that, Phil.

Yeah.

Anything?

No, not a bloody thing.

I think we have to rule out
the alphabetical approach.

And there's no pattern to
her targeting based on dates

Of release, birth, or arrest.

There you go.

Whoops.

I know we're both
thinking the same thing,

Even though we haven't
said it officially yet.

We're both thinking
that Jenny's a suspect.

Yeah.

That's what we're thinking.

Well, [inaudible]
isn't our only go.

I'm going to research every
female cop on the force.

Psych evals and pre-enlistment
files should be easy to get.

If any one of them even
vaguely smells bad,

We're looking into it.

Right?

Yeah.

Right.

I ever tell you how
we met, Jenny and me?

JACK: Yeah.

15 years ago at the academy.

Yeah.

First time I ever laid eyes on
her was on the target range.

My god, she was beautiful.

And a crack shot, too.

With a .38.

Yeah, with a .38.

That was her favorite.

Anyway, there we were.

Targets come up.

She with the .38,
me with Beretta.

We shoot.

[Mimics gun]

She gets a perfect score.

Me?

I lay a big fat egg, scores
lower than a rat's ass.

She always said that I could
never hit the side of a barn.

By god, she was right.

Oh, Phil, I hope it's not her.

I worked with Jenny for a
month last April at the academy.

Yeah, I remember.

She was good, smart.

But she didn't seem like the
type, the type to go nuts.

She was always
cool, professional.

It's not her.

JENNIFER: You come
to arrest me, Jack?

No.

You mind if I come in?

Yes, Jack, it's
laced with brandy.

Since when did you
start drinking, Jenny?

Since about a year ago, Jack.

What were you doing
there yesterday?

I told you.

I have the same
list that you have.

Well, I was your
liaison, remember?

You're supposed
to tell me first.

Going to Jefferson's was
a spur of the moment thing.

Running into you is coincidence.

Yeah.

Coincidence, right.

Fuck you, Jack.

I know what you're thinking.

Yeah, fuck you, Jenny.
I think you did it.

Yeah.

All the evidence
seems to point to you.

OK, fine.

Prove me wrong.

Why didn't you tell
Meadows about the list?

Why didn't you?

Because I was protecting
your ass, that's why.

If I would've told
Meadows, he would

Have dragged your ass down
this morning for a word with us

About the murder.

That's bullshit.

That's circumstantial evidence.

Bullshit, fine.

I can still nail you
on one other thing.

What's that, Jack?

When Trish pulled up the list,
there were only two other IDs

Attached to the mainframe for
accessing and compiling it.

One was Trish's, and
the other was yours.

Oh, come on.

Anyone could have erased their
name from the log-on code.

If you were systematically
planning to murder someone,

Would you leave a trail?

Answer my question.

Why didn't you tell
Meadows about the list?

Have you ever
heard of IA, Jack?

Internal Affairs would have
pawed around in this thing

So much, our shooter would've
stayed under for months, maybe

Even years.

Jack, if this is a cop...
And we got to believe

That it is... then she's smart.

She knows procedure.

I mean, she knows protocol.

Yeah, she's smart, all right.

Boy, you seem to have an
answer for every question,

Don't you, Jen?

If the question
is logical, yes.

Meadows told me that you had
yourself taken off the case.

Oh, god.

Want to tell me why?

I almost shot you
yesterday, Jack.

One wrong move,
and I would have.

OK.

You're... you're right.

I'm not psychologically suited
for this particular case.

Oh, Jack.

The thought of killing you...

OK.

I'm sorry.

Jack, I haven't been
with anyone since...

Shh.

Penny for your thoughts?

I was thinking of
Adams and Callister.

Remember them?

What about them?

I'm wondering how
a bad girl got them

Naked, handcuffed and naked.

At gunpoint, maybe?

Well, maybe she
seduced them into it.

Maybe she promised
them a good time.

Maybe she kissed them first.

And then told them they were
about to experience something

They had never felt before.

Then when she has them tied up,
our bad girl makes her move.


Seduction, Jack.

That's her weapon.

The rest is cake.

She mutilates them.

And then she shoots them.

And then she [inaudible].

Can you buy that
theory, detective?

Completely.

Can I ask you a
question, hypothetically?

Shoot.

What if you discovered
that I was the killer?

What would you do?

Is that a confession?

Think about it.

It's not like the men on
that list were innocent.

In all probability,
they hurt those girls.

How many rape cases
get thrown out

Of court because of no-shows?

How many rapists
get off scot-free?

In a way, don't you
feel they're getting

Exactly what they deserve?

My daughter was
taken from... from us.

And now, what would you do?

I'd stop you.

I'll never forgive you
for what happened to Tina.

But I never stopped loving you.

And I never will.

Dad, Milton's food is gone.

Will you go out to the store?

Oh, honey, I can't.

I got to run down
to headquarters.

I'll tell you what.

You promise you'll be
back in five minutes,

I'll let you go out.

And don't tell mom.

She'd kill me if I
didn't go with you.

The store's only
a block away, dad.

I can handle it.

You can handle it, huh?

Handle it.

Oh.

Jenny?

I still can't believe
that she's gone.

You're right about
this case, Jack.

Let it finish by itself.

Maybe it'll all work
out for the best.

PHIL: Jesus Christ, Jack.

You still look
like a fucking pig.

Fuck you.

What do you have?

Did you talk to her yet?

Yeah, I talked to
her, more than talked.

She didn't do it.

Maybe she did.

She didn't do it, Phil.

OK, OK.

I believe you.

I was going through
personnel files,

Came across a bit of a
stinker, Susan Treadwell,

Works in Rape, same as
your new girlfriend.

Yeah, I know Susan.

As a matter of fact,
she's Trish's sister.

Scary lady.

Yeah, well, get this.

Two years ago, she shot
and killed her husband,

Said it was self-defense.

He had some kind
of drug problem.

They called it an
open and shut case.

It's all in here.

Open and shut.

Where the fuck are you going?

We still have reasonable
doubt as to Jenny's innocence.

I'm going to kill that doubt.

DR. CARL STEINER: Look,
detective, I really

Don't have time for this.

I have a parole meeting at 3:00.

I have lunch at
the mayor's office.

I have sessions running all day.

I realize how busy
you are, Doctor.

No, you don't
realize how busy I am.

I haven't had time to piss.

And when I don't piss, I
get really, really angry.

So why don't you just make
a meeting for next week

With my secretary?

No, Doctor, this can't wait.

This is very, very important.

Please.
10 minutes.

10 minutes.

That's all I ask.

Detective, you are
a pain in the ass.

10 minutes.

That's it.

Thank you.

What you're saying is
ridiculous, Detective Mason.

But just out of
curiosity, why would you

Think that Jennifer would even
be remotely capable of doing

Such a horrible crime?

Doctor, one year ago, our
daughter was kidnapped,

Raped, sodomized, and killed.

She was 10 years old.

As you know, we never
caught the killer.

Could something like this have
so changed a person, a mother,

For instance, turned her into
something completely different,

Something unrecognizable?

So what you're
saying is that she was

So enraged that she
vicariously seeks revenge

Through any rape suspect?

Well, the murder
victims in this case

Are either rape dismissals
or rape attempts.

And we have a list.

But living or dead,
the names on that list

Can only be accessed through
the Police Department.

So question.

Could Jenny have done it?

Well, given sufficient
cause and sufficient motive,

I mean, anybody is capable
of doing the unthinkable.

But as you know yourself,
I think you and Jennifer

Are suffering from
some degree of, uh,

Post-traumatic shock syndrome.

And Jennifer's depressed
and understandably so.

But is she a murderer?

In my opinion, no.

This tape was made a month ago.

It's an interrogation that
Jennifer did of a rape suspect.

And after this,
she came to see me.

And I think you'll see why.

PHIL (ON TV): Mr. Thomas,
let's start again.

Did you or did you not on
the night of December 2

Take Molly Tills to your
apartment and rape her?

Did you not then
shortly thereafter slice

Her throat with a hacksaw?

Go fuck yourself, pig.

That's not going to
help us, Mr. Thomas.

Now we have witnesses
attesting to the fact

That they saw you leaving
the shopping center

Where you met the victim.

We also have witnesses
attesting to the fact

They saw you entering your
apartment [inaudible].

JENNIFER (ON TV): We also
have the murder weapon

With your fingerprints on it.

MR. THOMAS (ON TV): All right.

I fucked her.

I fucked her good.

I fucked her till she screamed.

You see, I like to
hear them scream.

And then I sliced the
little fucking bitch up.

Is that what you wanted
to hear, Detective?

Huh?

Are you happy now, Detective?

You sick fuck.

Do you want me to fuck you in
the asshole, huh? [Inaudible].

Cool down.

PHIL (ON TV): A little girl,
knowing she was going to die.

MR. THOMAS (ON TV): You bastard.

He fucking could
have killed me, OK?

JENNIFER (ON TV): I know.

But I must admit.

A part of me wanted him too.

Fuck you.

Get him out of here.

MR. THOMAS (ON TV): Fuck you.

Fucking suck my dick,
you fucking pig.

Jennifer has a lot a
rage, but despite that,

She showed a lot of restraint.

And tell the truth.

Didn't you want Officer
Stations to pull that trigger?

Yes.

Doctor, as Jennifer's
psychiatrist,

Would you say that you have
her complete confidence?

Look, I'm confident that
Jennifer's told me everything

To do with her depression, yes.

Then would you say,
in your expert opinion,

That Jenny has forgiven
me for Tina's death?

DR. CARL STEINER: Absolutely.

This is your fault.
This is all your fault.

OFFICER (ON TV): Look,
Jennifer is not your killer.

You're going to have to find
yourself another suspect.

Thank you.

The landlord let me in.

Jenny.

Don't.

Don't say anything, not now.

I'm going to kill him.

I'm going to kill all of them.

Don't.

She was only 10, Jack,
just 10 years old.

I love you, daddy.

This is your fault.
This is all your fault.

And I'm never going
to forgive you, Jack.

I love you, daddy.

Goodbye, my love.

[Engine starts]

Christ.

Bitch.

What the hell are you doing?

Shit.

[Phone ringing]

Yeah?

We got a positive ID
on the driver, Jack.

It was Susan Treadwell.

Jesus.

You sure work in Rape
long enough, you go nuts.

Yeah, I guess.

Thanks, Phil.

Trish.

I know.

It was Susan who was
killed in the car.

They called me a
few minutes ago.

She killed her.

Oh, honey, it was an accident.

And you're still trying
to protect her, aren't you?

You still love her that much?

Honey, it was an accident.

Susan came after me.

You can't blame Jenny for...

Like hell I can't.

Can't you see what she's
doing, what she's done?

Listen, Susan
accessed that file, OK?

She killed those men.

She must've panicked when she
knew I was coming too close,

And she came after me.

That and she hated me.

Why?

Look, she thought
that I was using

You to get closer to Jenny.

The mutilations
and the killings.

She had set that
up to set Jenny up,

And she also knew that
I still loved Jenny.

No.
Yes.

Listen to me.

Listen.

I opened her file.

Susan was raped at age
16, and you knew it.

She was.

She hated all men.

She did.

Every man except the one
she was going to marry.

He was supposed to be
different, except he wasn't.

He was a cop, and he
had a coke problem.

And one night two years
ago, he came after her,

And he tried to rape her,
and she shot him with a .38.

Didn't she?
No.

Yes.

Toxicology came back
with the blood samples.

Final exhibits, Trish.

Look.

Jenny was right.

Our murderer wore a blonde wig.

No!

Don't, Jack.

I'm pretty good with a .38.

Pretty good with a .38?

Oh, god.

[Tires screeching]

Jenny!

Jenny!

Trish!

Jenny!

[Phone ringing]

Hello?

Jack-o, I knew you'd be there.

JACK (ON PHONE):
Phil, where are you?

Outside of Munson's warehouse.

You remember Munson, the
last guy on our list?

[Knocking on door]

WOMAN: Mr. Munson?

Yes?

WOMAN: May I have
a word with you?

I'm trying to take
a fucking piss here.

Wait a minute.

WOMAN: Please.

JACK (ON PHONE):
Phil, listen to me.

Susan Treadwell wasn't our perp.

Yeah, I know.

I've been doing some
checking myself.

I know who our real bad lady is.


Phil?

I just heard a gunshot.

I gotta get going.

Phil, what is it?

Ph... shit.

[Tires screeching]

Phil?

WOMAN: Turn around,
Phil, slowly.

Phil.

WOMAN: You shouldn't
have come, Phil.

Oh, no.

Jack.

Phil.

It's not fair, Jack.

It's not fair.

Who did this?

I wanted to see the baby.

It's not fair.

Who did this, Phil?

Take care of Gwen,
Jack, and the baby.

Promise?

Yeah, I promise.

Phil, who did this?

I... it was her.

It was...

Who, Phil?

Oh.

Phil.


Shit.

Oh, fuck this.

JENNIFER: Jack, stay down!

Jennifer!
JENNIFER: It's Trish.

She killed Phil.

TRISH: She's lying.

She just fired at you, Jack.

She wants you to
believe it's me.

For God's sakes.

JENNIFER: She killed
them all, Jack.

That's what I was
doing tonight, running

A search on the computer.

I found Trish's log-on.

She killed the men who
had raped only children

Or juveniles to make it look
like my own personal vendetta.

TRISH: No!

JENNIFER: She thought
that if she framed me,

She could get rid of me,
and you would love her.

TRISH: Jack, don't
listen to her.

She's a liar.


Fucking shit.
TRISH: Stay down.

She's firing.

JENNIFER: He doesn't
believe that, Trish.

He knows the truth.

TRISH: Jack, listen.

I didn't kill anyone.

Yes, I love you, but I
wouldn't hurt anyone.

JENNIFER: It's not
her fault, Jack.

She's sick.

TRISH: Fuck you, you bitch.

JENNIFER: Her file... I read it.

She's been raped too,
just like her sister.

TRISH: Please, Jack.

You have to believe me.


Both of you show
yourselves, Jack.

TRISH: She's got me in
her crossfire, Jack,

Just like she does you.

Come out with
your weapons down.

TRISH: She lied to you, Jack.

JENNIFER: I will if she will.

All right.

I'm coming out.

Both of you, up.

Up now.

First one who moves, I drop.

Kill her, Jack.

If not or me, then for Phil.

If I drop the
gun, she's got me.

Jack, the wig, that .38.

That's bullshit.

Those weren't Susan's.

Of course not, Trish.

They were yours.

Jack, she put them
in the apartment.

She planned the whole thing.

I did some digging, Jack.

That first night, two
murders, Adams and Callister.

Trish came to your
house at 12:00 midnight,

Didn't she, Jack?

Yeah, I know.

It's my job.

Anyway, Adams was
found at 10:30 PM.

ME put the time of
death at 10:00 PM.

But Trish went back to your
house to give herself an alibi.

Callister's TOD was 2:30 AM.

Now you tell me, Jack.

Did she spend the whole night?

Jesus Christ, Jack.

She knows about us.

She's spying on us.

Put the gun down, Trish.

It's over.

Jack.

Look out, Jack!

No, Trish.

Ugh.


No!


LT. MEADOWS:
Christ, what a mess.

Two crazy sisters, both cops,
both psychotic murderers.

IA's going to love this one.

Starting tonight, both
of you, on vacation.

Jack, go home.

This time, I mean it.

What is it?

Trish.

I still can't believe
that she did it.

I just can't buy it.

Sometimes the unbelievable
is what we have to believe,

No matter how much it hurts.

See you.

JACK: Care to give me
Trish's modus operandi?

JENNIFER: I told you I
had some explaining to do.

JACK: Shoot.

JENNIFER: She loved
you, Jack, and she

Wanted me out of the way.

She compiles her list of
rape attempts, all of which

Resemble Tina's case,
and she goes to work.

She knows the files
are open only to LAPD.

The finger points at me.

JACK: Why the mutilation aspect?

JENNIFER: She was
raped once, Jack.

So was her sister.

The castrations were a personal
vindication against all men.

JACK: But she loved me.

And I'm...

JENNIFER: A man.

Yeah.

I know.

You're a man, but you're a man
who, in a way, shared a pain

As horrible as Trish's,
the loss of a child,

Of the child within,
the loss of innocence.

I love you.

I love you, too.


Jenny?

Hmm?

Can you forgive me?

Can you ever forgive me?

No, Jack, I can't.

But I have a kind of revenge,
and I can live with that.

Revenge?

Revenge against who?

Him.

Tina's killer.

You.

Yeah, you.

You see, Jack.

I know you really
cared for Trish.

And she really loved you,
all the way to the end.

Jenny, can I ask you a
question, hypothetically?

Shoot.

What if it wasn't Trish
who killed all those people?

Adams, Callister, Munson, Phil.

What if it was someone else?

Then an innocent
woman died for nothing.

But Trish tried to kill
me in the warehouse.

Yeah.

It did look like that.

But it is possible that she was
just turning to you to plead

With you for you to
believe her, and you

Reacted exactly as
you should have,

Thinking she was
turning to fire.

You saw her gun come
up, and you shop first.

I think it worked
out for the best.

Oh, Jenny, you don't
mean that, do you?

You see, Jack.

That's my revenge.

You get to wonder
if I do or not.

JACK (VOICEOVER): There are
some things worse than death.

Perhaps knowing too
much is one of them.
