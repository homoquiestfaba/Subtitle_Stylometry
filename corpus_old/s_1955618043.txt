From all the places i've done,

Be happy, it's not complicated.

Even the simplest job can go
wrong, my friend.

What a hell are you doing?

Let me check first. Don't stop here,
keep going. Go down the street.

Jesus Christ!

All right. It looks ok. Make a u turn.
Pull around and let me out up front.

is your partner.

God help you...

when you are retiring in 11 months.

Half the precinct hates my guts

Well, it's not in our policy to

I'll like to meet your partner,
Jack sometime.

No, no...

No, no, no way, he does not

What's the matter?
You don't trust him?

No, i trust him with my life...
it's just that...

...i don't know how would he
take this?

-Take what? The heat?
-Yeah. Yeah, the heat.

Speaking of which...

We should take our close off, i think

What a clever idea, you think i
should take my close off?

It's just a thought.

You have make me cool,

-I'll think i'll take my chances.
-We live on the edge, aren't we?

You 're under a arrest.
Where's your gun?

-I don't have one.
-I don't believe you.

-Is it in here, ha?
-No.

-Is it hidden under your skirt?
-Why don't you find out.

Look, i don't know what to tell you.
I don't have any rooms, and i can't

give you what i don't have.
I told you this before.

You keep coming back.
I told you to wait at least 2 hrs...

Excuse me?

-Cantrell came yet? I supposed to
meet him. -Mr. Cantrell, yes he has.

-What's the extension?
-Oh, God...

It's 0219. Telephone is right over

Ok, now the best i can do for you
is i get you the room in two hours.

You have the right to remain
silent.

I'll confess. I confess.

<i>Anything</i> you say, can be used
against you <i>on the court of law.</i>

<i>I'm guilty. Mmm...
I am guilty.</i>

It's the new experience

<i>Don' move anything, don't step

-I guess he never learned his lesson.
-Shut up, Al!

Captain, i don't have to remind you,
this is a crime scene...

-What next?
-How do you mean "what next"?

How do you mean
"i guess he never learned his lesson"?

Captain said, Art was ripp the
man for dating a prostitute.

I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

-Captain? You allright?
-I can't breathe.

Give me some water.
Do you want me to...

-Here. Sit, right here.
-I'm tearing apart inside.

I knew Art for 35 years.
He was my friend.

-What a hell is going on here?
-Easy. Deep breathe, cap.

So... so, where the hell is that
water?

-Here you go, sarg.
-Thanks. Here.

Easy now.

I think i see one death too many.

-He was my friend.
-I know.

I don't know about you, how you
must feel. This must have been hitting you.

Same as you and, um...
Sick.

I lost somebody who was close
to me as Art was...

Anybody know anything about
that, um...

-That woman?
-No, nothing.

I just can't... i just can't believe,
Art was such a family man...

-Skeletons.
-What?

Skeletons. Everybody got one
in the closet.

You don't know anything about
anybody, really. Till after they are dead.

He was the best.

He took a bullet for me, one time.

The gun jammed, he stepped
in front of me. Got shot off.

Took the bullet for me.

After i got that desk job, i never
got a chance to pay him back.

-Are there any suspects?
-Just a whore.

Jumped of the balkony.
Hopefully we get ID from the prints.

<i>"You might be a hero today but,

<i>"Hi! It's Meredith. Saw you on TV.

<i>"Jackie Jack, hi honey, heard the

Hey, we will just have our own
prolonged slumber party, allright?

I have got 45 pounds of junk food

I just keep thinking you know,

Any description on the woman,
from Arts room?

Ah, just a half naked female
who runned trough a lobby.

Does gate keeper has anything
to contribute?

Yeah, he said that he saw it
but, what can we do when we don't

keep books anymore.

Description was a little more
detailed when he told me about it.

Look, what do you want me to do Jack?
I took down what he give me.

Clerk said anything about any
golfers?

Yeah, but he could not placed
them at the scene. I mean...

... hotel is full of golfers this
time of year.

I guess you didn't talk to the maid,
cuz she placed them 5 minutes

outside his room before he
got shot.

-A maid?
-Housekeeper at the hotel.

I'll check it out. Thanks Jack.
Thanks.

I don't believe this guy, rats out
on Lavery, now telling people

-how they do their job.
-It's nothing.

-"It's nothing"?
-Art was his partner.

Yeah. It should be him standing
in that hotel room instead of Art.

If Captain didn't put him in the
legal research, he would made it

-through the week.
-Probably less then that.

I would not bet on that.

Hi, Katie.

-Captain?
-Yeah, Jack?

I make the composite of the
arsonist. I liked to release to the press.

-Yeah, you wrep that up.
-Yes, sir. Umm.

-May i speak to you in your office, please?
-Yeah, go ahead.

It's about Arts murder.

I think Sherwin is blowing it.
I got back to a hotel, i talk to

witnesses, got information that
he did not have.

-Or wasn't following through...
-We have been through this before.

You are a sargeant in the legal
research department.

-But, there's vital information...
-No, no. no, buts about...

Sherwin has his job to do
and you have your job to do.

-Stay out of it.
-What about the leads?

I'll follow that with Sherwin.

Look, i just tought, if there was
a way...

You want me to be formal about this,
i will be formal about this.

I am ordering you to stay away
from investigating all the witnesses

in this case. Is that clear?

-Yes, sir.
-Good! Now, get out of here.

I've got a lot of work to do.

-Channel 6? Ron Masters, please.
<i>-One moment, please.</i>

<i>-This is Ron Masters.</i>
-Hallo.

This is detective Jack Flinder.
Do you remember who i am?

<i>Yes, detective. We meet at the

-Welcome to legal research, Jack.

-Hallo?
<i>-Jack?</i>

-Yes, who is this?
<i>-This is Mary, look...</i>

<i>... i don't have a lot of time right
now, so i'm going get right to the point.</i>

<i>I was with Art Cantrell the night
he was murdered.</i>

<i>And the same people who murdered
him, are trying to murder me.</i>

Really? <i>Can you prove that?</i>

What do you mean can i prove it?
I was <i>there.</i>

-Well, where are you now, Mary?
-Why?

Well, i think we have to meet <i>in
person.</i>

I wont do it. Not unless you
promise you wont take me downtown.

You know, i can't make that kind
of a promise.

I can identify one of his killers.
There were 2 white men dressed as golfers.

Can you meet me at 5:30 <i>at a Staffords.
Get in the back entrance.</i>

Ok, bye.

Are you Jack?

-Mary?
-Yeah.

-I mean no, no. Lisa is my real name.
-Okay.

Look, look, i need you to
understand when i say...

-Call the police.
-You are the police.

I did call the police.

They are only interested in me so
they can arrest me for Arts murder.

-What makes you think i wouln't?
-I trusted you.

-Can i?
-Lets sit. Comon.

This way please.

Ask the waitress to get us 2 coffee,
please.

Certanly.

-Is that allright? Coffee?
-Yeah.

Ok, why u don't tell me
what happened?

I was at Monica's apartment, door bell
ringed, she went to the door, i heard the shot,

-and she was murdered.
-Wait, who?

-Who's Monica?
-Monica is my girlfriend.

I went to her apartment after
leaving the hotel, they found me

-and they killed her...
-Alright, allright.

-They murdered her and...
-Stop. Allright.

Let's back to the beginning.
What's your name?

-Lisa Cates.
-What were you doing at the hotel with Art?

-You are prostitute?
-No, i'm not a prostitute.

-Well, Tell me what where you doing?
-I am not a prostitute.

How i know you are not envolved
in the murder?

If i were, will i jump from the balkony
into the pool, leaving my purse and my ID

behind.

-You left your ID in your purse?
-Yes.

Now you understand why i'm so
scared?

Ok.

Tell me what happened before that.

2 guys dressed as golfers,
broke into the room.

They had on Groucho Marx glasses.

They shoot Art, one of them
felt his glasses, i saw his face

-and he tried to kill me.
-Can you identified this guys face?

-Yes.
-Good.

-Here we go.
-Thank you.

And for you.

Why don't you tell me about this
other person, friend of yours?

I went... I went to her apartment
after i runned from the hotel.

They found me there.
And i know it's the same 2 guys.

I am not crazy. I am not draging,
i am not lying to you.

I need you to help find this guys.

I'll do everything to help you,
but i am not going downtown.

-Why are you so afraid of them?
-Because they know thing about me.

I am the perfect scapegoat.

You take me downtown and you
wont hear a beep out of me.

-I say you are restrained...
-Oh, that's comforting.

I put you in the hotel for a couple
of days till i sort this things out.

No! That's how Art was killed.

Look, you loose me,
you loose your only eyewitness.

I put you in my house, if i don't
uncover anything in 72hrs

i'm gona have to take you
downtown myself.

-This is nice.
-Thanks.

-What do you thinking?
-That i must have known,

that you and Art are meeting at the
hotel at that time.

-Well, yeah. We had a standing date.
-Aha.

You know, i resent that "aha"!

Stop putting as a defensive, i try
figure this out as well as you are!

In order to do that i have to put
you some question.

Questions i don't mind, it's the
insinuations that bother me.

I've been up all night, i am tired,
i am dirty and if you don't mind

i would like to freshened up before
we finish up this little inquisition.

-This is not an inquisition.
-Oh, yeah? Well, can you prove it?

Bathroom is down the hall,
towels are on your right.

Thank you.

-Who is it?
<i>-It's me. It's us.</i>

<i>-We are here.</i>
-Hi.

<i>-Arent you gona open the door?
-Sure.</i>

I think that Jackie Jack forgot ,
when he look through the window, he said:

"Oh, no, what are they doing here"?

I didn't forget, i, i just thought
they are got early then i expected.

If you tell me you forgot, i wouln't
be surprised.

-Disapointed yes, surprised no.
-Don't say anything, Jack.

-I didn't forget, i didn't forget...
-Don't tell me, don't tell me...

Let me guess?
A really bad time.

I'm sure daddy if he know what a busy man
you are gona be, we be consolting with you

for chosing his date of birth.
Maybe so he considerate that way that

men are always thinking about
themselvs and that...

-You must have a maid.
-No.

-Are you ready?
-No. Umm... Yes. No, umm...

-No, yes, no, yes, yes...
-Ann? Ann?

My God, i can hear that loud shit
of a music even...

...in the... bethroom.

-Hi.
-Hi.

I'm Ann. Jack's sister.

And this is Kurt, my everloving
hobi. I'm sure Jack speaked about us

frequenly and foundly, about his
shallow, selfenvolved, uninformed...

... sister and brother in law.

When you put it that way, yes
he mentioned you.

Well, we are not all that
superficial, we are just modern family

-in what those things Jack does so well.
-Yes, hes mastered that art.

I'm sure Jack told you about our
father's birthday partying?

Jack, where are your menors?

-She is...
-I... i really should not...

Oh, what pressing plansdo you have
this evening? Answer me one question.

It's run in the family.

What better evening could you possibly
have, then going to a birthday party?

Hanging out, on the fabulous yacht.
Drinking, dancing, going wild, yes.

-I know.
-So?

-Do you have a problem?
-No.

Look at this girl, she is so resursfull.
She can take care of herself.

I shop 4 days and spend more then
700 dollars, she's going into my

brothers closet, 5 minutes later
couple safety pins and looking like

a million dollar bucks. I'm not sure
if we can be friends.

-There she goes.
-WoW.

I'm here, the party can start now.

Are you sure this is ok?

I am gona stay here in case

-Did you not see me blink the lights?
-No, i missed that.

One of Arts killers, the one that i saw,
walked around the corner at the bar door,

and then he took off.
He had a gun...

<i>... and then just runned up
the street.</i>

I must have missed something
like that.

I know, i know, it's
not your job, right?

<i>Come on! Come on!
Let's book!</i>

That's the... that voice...
that's the other guy.

<i>-That's the other man.</i>
-Man? What are you talking about?

The second man. They killed Art,
and then he said: "Let's book".

-That's just an expresion.
-No.

Listen to me damn it!
Listen to me!

On his wrist he has a tattoo,
<i>on his right wrist.</i>

It's a domino, half a tic tac toe...

Somebody wanna tell me what
a hell is going around here?

-It's quiet a storm.
-I've gotta go.

-What can you tell me, Jack?
-Captain, i need to speak to you in private.

Well, hey, i can take a hint.
I'm gone.

Sherwin?

About this night, i just want to say
i havent been myself lately and i...

had a lot going on and, umm...

I havent been in my head mostly,
but i'm back and...

I just wanna say thanks.

-For understanding.
-Uh, well, hey, Jack...

I'm always there for you.
No problem, ha?

Thanks.

-Can i talk to you?
-Yeah.

I'm eagger to hear about
legal research.

Sherwin was in on Arts murder.

What?

Him and insurence investigator
Kraus fon Zack.

Are you out of your mind?

Lyman before got shot, connected
Kraus fon Zack to Arts murder.

Oh, you believe story of an arsonist
who's about to go to a gas chamber.

-Go on.
-Kraus was also the shooter

tonight.
He shot Lyman.

You saw it?

-Lisa Cates did.
-Lisa Cates? Lisa Cates!

We identified Lisa Cates as a
prime suspect in Arts murder, Jack.

-Let me finish...
-Where the hell is she?

-She's safe.
-Safe?

Safe?

Jack, Lisa Cates is a lighthook.
You know what lighthook is?

Lighthook is somebody who hooks
only when it's profitabile.

To... To move some drugs, to
run a con, anything that works.

She is tough and she is smart.

Very smart.

And you're over your head.

Then how come Lisa Cates,
can identified Sherwin's voice?

And a tattoo on his right wrist?

There has been a second shooter
on Arts murder.

Allright.

Allright. If you gona pursued this,
i have no choice but to roll in it.

But You, are gona have to bring
Lisa Cates in.

-No.
-Yes!

I'll put you in the witness
protection.

-No...
-Listen! Listen to me!

At least until...
i arrest and indict Sherwin.

-Witness protection?
-Yeah.

Half the cops out here, hate you
because what you did to Lavery.

Now you are accusing a homicide
detective of an obnoxous murder.

For a cop killing.

It's is the only way for me to
keep you for not getting killed, Jack.

Lisa Cates? Damn!

Allright, listen.

Listen to me, this is gona
take me...

at least a day.

And everything will be taken care of
so the earliest day to take you in,

is tomorrow night.

-Yeah.
-Ok.

Meet me at parking structure at
Royal Building on the 3rd level

at 8 p.m., and you bring the girl.
We will take you in, take your statements,

and i'll take it from there.

In the meantime, i want you to
go hiding, don't go home,

just rent some room in a hotel
or somewhere.

And don't you call me, i don't
wanna know where you are.

How am i suposed to go out
of here without being followed?

Well, i will walk you about 10 yards
or so...

... and then, umm...
you are on your own.

Allright?

Let's go.

I hope this turns out to be like
you said, for your sake.

So do i.

Ok, but how the shooter knew
where to find me?

-You said he could followed Lyman.
-Could have taken Lyman anytime.

Lyman? I don't understand what
are you saying?

I am saying that Lyman led the
shooter to me.

-Are you saying that i set you up?
-Did you?

No! I tryied to warn you!

-How?
-I flash lights just like you told me to.

I did not see them flash.

-This is not about me seting you up, is it?
-It's exactly what it's about.

No, it's not.

This is about people
letting you down.

And you can't stand a fact that
they are wrong and i am right.

Because you got this idea about
who they are not and who i am.

And you just fit with what you want.

Well, i didn't killed Art, i didn't set
you up and i am the only person

who wants the same thing what
you want, but you just can't

believe that, can you?

What is it exactly that you think
i want?

Well, i tought it was the truth,
but i don't know anymore.

There he is.

Jack...

-That van...
-What about it?

It was in front of Monica's house,
the night she was murdered.

Duck!
Jack!

Listen, listen, listen, listen...

-Lisa? We are safe...
-No!

Hey, listen to me...
Look at me.

Look at me.
Lisa?

Oh, no, please!

Look at me.
Look at me.

Deep breathe.

Easy.

I am sorry.

I am so sorry,
i have doubt at you.

You hear me?

<i>What's happening?</i>

cuz he found out that they are
making 3 million on a loss of a burned

building, <i>that they set up fires
and Durand was running the all show.</i>

He's been on television,
moping out the rug.

I know.

<i>You should surrender to a
criminal lawyer. I can arange that.</i>

-I don't know.
-Where are you now?

-I'm on the boat.
-Good.

I'll get the lawyer and come down.

Don't leave that boat.

-Don't tell me you don't love this?
-What?

<i>-Lawyer rescuing the cop.</i>
-No, i don't love it.

I love you.

I love you too.

<i>-Special operator.</i>

I never wanted that to happened.

I loved Art.

You sure having a funny way to
show it that, Captain.

Look, he was on to me.

There's too... gut.

Too selfrightness.

There was no way he was ever

-I lost everything.

My life savings, everything.

That means, to somebody at
my age.

Locals and insurence pay us

-I have nothing.
-What do you have now?

She... She came out...

Risking her life for you.

Something... i... never...
