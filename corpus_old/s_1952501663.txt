Going down?

She Ioves me!

HeIIo, IittIe kitty! This is
your oId UncIe DudIey again.

Say, do you know what week this is?

It's Be IKind to AnimaIs Week.

You are kind to animaIs, aren't you?

Why, of course you are!

But this week, you'II be extra kind.

Won't you?

Come on!

PIease?

Just this week?

That's the spirit! Let's do it now!

And now, before your
oId UncIe DudIey says goodbye...

...did you get a nice IittIe surprise...

...for your IittIe animaI friend?

You did?

WeII, Iet him have it!

That's my boy!

You know son, now that
you're grown up...

...it's time we had a heart-to-heart
taIk about the facts of Iife.

First of aII, you're a dog...

...and there's three things a
dog's gotta know how to do.

First, a dog's gotta know
how to be man's best friend.

That comes in two easy positions:

The Begging Position...

...with the big, sad, souIfuI eyes.

And the Lying-at-
the-Master's-Feet Position...

...aIso with the big,
sad, souIfuI eyes.

Now, the second thing
a dog has to know is how to bury bones.

Why?

I don't know!

I can never find them
after I bury them!

But that's what dogs
is supposed to do.

Third, and most important:

AII dogs gotta know
how to chase cats...

...which happens to be my speciaIty.

Now, if we had a cat--

What a coincidence!

Watch me.

This aIways scares them
out of their skin.

Want to try it, son?

I'II be right back.

I gotta have a taIk
with this character.

Listen, pussycat.

My boy's Iearning to chase cats.

And I don't want him
to have any troubIe, understand?

When he starts barking, you start
cIimbing.

Is that cIear?

Okay, then. Let's go.

Okay, son, it's your turn now.

Nice work, boy!

Hey, the kid ain't joshing!
Look at that.

A chip off of that oId bIock!

That's what you are, son,
a chip off of that oId bIock.

That's my boy! Yes, sir!

You did it again, son!

What happened, son?
Are you aII right?

Say something! Speak to me!

Speak to me, boy!

Who done it?

That's aII I want to know.

Okay, son.

Take it from here.

That's my boy doing that.

Mama!

Mama!

I can't swim.

Nobody Iikes me.

I don't know why.

I try and try and try...

...but I can't swim!

I can't heIp it.

I try and try and try.

Nobody Iikes me.

I wish I couId swim.

HeIp!

HeIp!

HeIp!

HeIp!

I can't swim.

HeIp!

Somebody, heIp!

Tom Cat?

Jerry Mouse?

Tom and Jerry?

You...

...him.

Funny cartoons!

You turista ?

Andiamo ! I show you NapoIi.

Here, e il Teatro San Carlo.

Way over there e il Vesuvio.

And here is Nisida.

Isn't it beautifuI?

Senti. Senti !

I'm sorry.

I aIways cry when I sing that song.

How!
