[Woman Narrating]
Guy Maddin, housepainter...

swirling around in his little dreams,
his little memories.

[Seagulls Squawking]

About to return
to his childhood home...

after an absence of 30 years.

Summoned by a letter from his mother,
also not seen in 30 years.

"It is my dying wish...

"that you go back
to our old home at Black Notch...

"and give the lighthouse
two good coats of paint...

"so that I might see it
spruce and proper...

at least once before I pass on. "

[Oars Creaking]

"I will come when I'm able,
if I am able.

Signed, Mother. "

[Seagulls Squawking]

The past.

The past.

Into the past.

[Wind Blowing]

The deserted Black Notch Island.

The deserted lighthouse.

Site of the old mom-and-pop orphanage
run by Guy's parents.

What distant, distant memories.

Slap a coat of paint on it!

Cover it up. Cover it up, Guy!

Two good coats. Two.

The past.

The past.

The past.

Painting, brooding,
thinking of the past-

of home, of childhood...

of loves lost...

of scattered friends...

of happiness grown cold.

Brooding and painting.

Painting and brooding.
The past!

The past.

The past.

Young Guy, 12 years old...

out at the secret meeting of orphans.

All eyes on Savage Tom...

the oldest orphan on the island...

leading a Black Mass.

[Radio Device: Static, Garbled Voice]

[Static, Garbled Voice]

Guy's older sister-

always living dangerously.

Sis, always in trouble,
always in trouble.

[Radio Device: Static, Garbled Voice]

[Wind Blowing]
[Buoy Bell Clanging]

To bend a young boy's will...

Guy's mother threatens daily
to sell the island.

Guy, heir to his father's island
and orphanage.

And the threats gnaw like worms
in the lad's bosom.

"I, too, am an orphan.

"My mother, I am told,
was very beautiful...

"but completely bald.

"Her sister had superb hair
but was barren of womb.

"The two girls
were so jealous of each other...

"of what the other had-
hair, a baby-

"they didn't waste words.

"Their hatred spilled over
into bloody violence.

"Knives were never far from hand.

"One was scalped
for her beautiful hair...

the other one stabbed into the stomach
to get at that baby. "

"From my mother's womb untimely ripped...

"I was carved from my mother's belly.

"Now my mother and aunt are buried
in the silt of the lagoon...

"next to each other...

disgraced, forgotten. "


The sights, the sounds...

the feel of Guy's beloved island.

While the orphans toil at their chores...

young Guy is free
to wander his island...

free to indulge himself,
free to remember.

Free to remember.

[Seagulls Squawking]

[Seagull Squawking]

So many secret spots to revisit.

And out gush the torrents of memory.

Everything that happens
will happen again, twice.

"The first time
I will just see something...

"smell it or taste it...

"but it won't stick.

"I know there will come again
someday...

a second chance
to really feel these things really. "

One day, Guy's solitary practices
received a spectacular, disruptive jolt-

the sudden appearance
upon his familiar island of a celebrity.

Is it?

Is it?

It's Wendy Hale, the sister half
of sibling teen detectives...

known around the world
to readers of crime stories...

as the Lightbulb Kids.

With her brother, Chance Hale,
these two intrepid sleuths...

have earned far-flung fame...

for both their harp playing
and their crime solving.

"I am here on Black Notch Island...

"to work on the case
of The Face in the Lighthouse.

"Seems many of the children
adopted out of this orphanage...

have very suspicious holes
pierced into the back of their heads. "

## [Playing Softly]

"Oh, Wendy."

Shh. Secrets.

Secrets.

Shh.

[Narrator, Whispering]
Secrets are always told in whispers.

[Gears Clattering]

[Radio: Static, Garbled Voice]

Guy, always on the run-
running to please.

Secrets.

Secrets.

Secrets.

"Mother!"

[Bell Jingles]

[Radio: Static, Garbled Voice]

Invented by Guy's father...

the aerophone allows
two people who love each other...

to communicate
over great distances...

merely by speaking into or bending an ear
toward the horn.

The signal is strongest
when the feelings are running high...

when the communicants
are deeply in love...

but also during outbursts
of extreme fury.

[Garbled Voices]

In other instances,
the signal is either weak or nonexistent.

And so, Mother has given little aerophones
to her two children...

in order to tell them she loves them
and to keep them out of trouble.

Just one of the fantastic devices
invented by Guy's father.

once threw his little brother's toy...

into a powerful transformer...

never expecting the toddler
would retrieve it.

The little one was fried to an ash...

and Neddie has been
ticking and twitching ever since.

[Aerophone: Static, Garbled Voice]

[Garbled Voice, Shouting]

"A nd both my mother and I
have identical birthmarks over our womb...

"as if a knife had cut us open too.

"Isn't that creepy?

It looks like Rumania, doesn't it?"


"Rumania! Rumania! Rumania!"

[Aerophone: Static, Garbled Voice]

[Garbled Voice, Shouting]

Charms just asking to be enjoyed.

[Buoy Bell Clanging]

Wendy decides that she can pursue
her interests on Black Notch Island...

much better as a boy...

so she quickly disguises herself
as her own brother-

Chance Hale, teen detective.

[Seagulls Squawking]

Chance explains that Wendy was called
back home on a secret business...

and that he, Chance, would be
taking over the Black Notch investigations.

"Oh, Wendy."

The detective gets down to work.

Chance is gathering all the evidence.

Guy, smitten again.

This time, Chance is the dazzling one.

"Oh, Chance. Chance."

Hero and role model.

"Chance-all to myself."

Chance thinks differently than the other boys.

Mother used suicide threats
as her primary teaching aid.

She kept orphans and offspring alike
in line with colorful bluffs.

Chance has this theory,
and his theories are always right.

Mother and Father are criminals.

Chance says so.

Fearing that Sis will touch him...

and discover his secret identity
as a girl...

Chance devises a strategy
of the kissing gloves.

"Only the wearer
of these nifty little items...

is allowed to do any touching, "
claims Chance.

Ah! Sweet gloves.

"I think they are lonely."

Chance wants Sis,
and Sis wants Chance.

Can it last?

[Seagulls Squawking]

[Rock Splashes In Water]

Both Guy and Sis
are crazy about Chance.

Guy pines for Wendy...

but loves every second spent
with his new hero, Chance.

The secret touches between Chance and Sis...

and the secret touches yet to come.

The kissing gloves
now the undressing gloves.

Mother is determined to age backwards.

To become a little girl again.
Even a baby-

a complete innocent.

She's even set aside
a cradle in her room...

for when the day of infancy
finally returns.

I will always be there for him. "
