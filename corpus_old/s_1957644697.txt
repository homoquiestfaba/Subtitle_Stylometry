[Announcer] Attention
Quinn University students.

The Student Med league of dormitory 17

would like to announce the
arrival of a new topical dressing

being tested for breast
augmentation procedures.

Female students with a
double D cup or under

are urged to take part
in this important study.

Students in the double D division
and larger need not apply

as the last subject
tested in this category

fell forward and suffered
a severe concussion.

No fee will provided for participants,

other than the personal gratification

of contributing to the
upliftment of humanity.

Refreshments will be served in
conventional styrofoam cups.

Debby Di Solman, please scrub
up and report to the lab

for emergency hydrotherapy.

Well Gina, you should
go to the polo match

with me tomorrow.

I didn't know you
Australian's liked polo,

I thought that was more
of a British thing.

Well, it's an acquired taste

but I think you'd have a good time

because you can meet
some very rich men there.

Oh well I'm game for that.

I'm tired of going Dutch all the time.

So you and Ron haven't
patched up your differences huh?

Well, only that one night

that someone put Spanish
wine in our punch.

Well actually come to think of it

we did have sex one more time after that.

Well how was it?

[Gina] Like beating a dead horse.

Well, that reminds of the story

of Catherine the Great of Russia.

Was she famous for beating dead horses?

Well actually dear it
was the other way round.

â™ª Fuel supply is low â™ª

â™ª As my target closes in at
almost twice the speed of sound â™ª

â™ª I'll shed a tear â™ª

â™ª For those below â™ª

â™ª Halfway to Heaven, halfway to Hell â™ª

Supposedly Catherine the Great

was this insatiable nymphomaniac

who no man could fully satisfy.

Well I can relate (laughs).

One day Catherine decided

that she wanted to make it with a horse.

A horse?

Yeah, a horse.

So she had the palace engineers

build this tremendous
harness above her bed

so that they could lower
the horse to hoist--

That's sick.

Did she actually do it with a horse?

Oh no, the horse fell and
it crushed her to death.

Oh god, what a horrible way to go.

I know.

At least she went with
her riding boots on.

I went to a past life
therapist this week

and I was regressed back to
my last three incarnations.

God that sounds pretty wild.

So who were you in your past lives?

Well let's see.

From 1774 to 1798 I was
a Zulu warrior in Africa.

Didn't live too long that time did you?

Oh no, it was a jungle out there.

Oh and from 1806 to 1867,

I was a promiscuous southern belle

on a Carolina cotton plantation.

Who were you after that?

A nun in Vatican City.

Huh.

Tell me about the
promiscuous southern belle.

You know, I thought you'd
ask me about that one.

My name was Nelly.

Nelly Anastasia Rydell.

(magical music)

My father, Obadiah Rydell
made a fortune growing cotton

for a French woman's
underpants manufacturer.

One morning when I was about 21 years old,

I was sipping a mint julep on the veranda,

a gentleman caller I'd
come to know quite well

came a calling.

He was a Frenchman named Hugh Hardone.

Monsieur Hardone was the buyer

for the underwear
manufacturer over in France.

He'd come back by my by, very
often to check the crops.

Making sure the cotton was good quality

befitting fine ladies underpants.

Hugh didn't speak the
English language very well

so we developed this sort of uh,

romantic shorthand.

Knowing my daddy was
out plowing the fields,

Hugh wasted no time making
his intentions known.

We went upstairs to the room
at the tip top of the house.

There were windows all around
looking out into the trees.

We pretended we were a couple of squirrels

jumping branches outside,

gathering nuts for the
long, lonely winter.

Like the gentleman that he was

Hugh helped me disrobe out
of the cumbersome apparel

that was fashion of the times.

(rock music)

Did you ever see Hugh Hardone again?

No, his ship sunk off the
coast of the Canary Islands.

Yeah he went down with
1,100 bales of cotton.

Yeah, well virgin cotton,

which is much more than I
can say for myself my dear.

Quite, what a sad ending.

Not really.

That's the nice thing about reincarnation,

you can just keep coming
back and doing it over again.

â™ª I feel my temperature rise â™ª

â™ª You make me sweat â™ª

â™ª And there's something
that my body can't forget â™ª

â™ª You make me sweat â™ª

â™ª My body's on fire but I'm dripping wet â™ª

â™ª Got a hell of a fever

â™ª When my breath gets short â™ª

â™ª My hearts starts to pound â™ª

â™ª I can't control what
I'm thinking about â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I always remember

â™ª It's dripping from my forehead â™ª

â™ª It's beading on my brow â™ª

â™ª I've used up all my body

â™ª You make me sweat â™ª

â™ª And there's something

(audience applauding)

[Announcer] Thank you Debby,

your test results are 10, nine, 10.

Very impressive.

Doctors Peters and Gruss would

like to schedule an appointment
for further evaluation

at your earliest convenience.

Have you ever thought about

going to see a past life therapist?

Uh, no way.

I mean if I found out
that I was someone like

Catherine the Great or someone like that,

then I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

Well the way I see
it, it wasn't her fault

she died an ignoble death.

I mean I think that it was the product

of poor structurous engineering.


[Announcer] Dr. Cleo
Theraidus please report

Whoa look who just walked in.

Wendy Waltsman, pre-med and

No way, I wouldn't even touch her

â™ª 'Cause I gave myself to you â™ª

â™ª I'll never be the same â™ª

â™ª Baby you're so vain â™ª

â™ª You're so vain â™ª

Good evening gentleman.

Hi Wendy.

Rough at the orifice dear?

Oh I see we have a fledgling
chlamydian in our midst.

So, you think proctology
is a joke do you...

Tony.

And this is my friend Ron.

Hi Ron.

We'll see just how much Tony's
funny bones gets tickled

if he ever has a hemorrhoid
that needs to be lanced.

(laughs) Touche.

It's a tough job but--

I know, I know, someone's gotta do it.

You know if there's one thing I hate,

it's people who use cliches.

It's kind of like wearing
old worn out shoes,

however, for lack of a better phrase,

I must admit a hard man is good to find.

Oh.

Hey if the shoe fits?

â™ª Will I keep offending â™ª

â™ª Can't you see â™ª

â™ª Hit and run â™ª

I have a confession to make Gina.

I lied about the Zulu war
in the late 18th Century.

Oh.

Well then, who were you then?

I mean Betsy Ross or Florence
Nightingale or you know, who?

Catherine the Great (laughs).

Oh my god, no wonder you are like,

How's your 10 foot pole Tony?

Last time I looked it
was 8.4 inches and holding.

Ooh that is a record?

No but it's a damn good average.

[Announcer] Thank you Cleo,

your test results are 10, nine, 10.

You are currently tied
with Debby Di Solman

for the lead position.

Please report to Dr. Beards
office for a second opinion.

This is the same technique
my past life therapist

used on me to help me regress.

I don't know about that.

I have really hard time believing
in all that voodoo crap.

It's just creation of your imagination.

Your eyes, they start drooping,

feeling really heavy,

drooping like a porno
stars wilting phallus

after an 18 hour marathon shooting day.

â™ª Wind me up like up a toy all day long â™ª

â™ª Until I have to go home â™ª

â™ª Oh â™ª

â™ª You really got me going â™ª

God I wish they'd keep
that noise down in there

with that ridiculous wet t-shirt contest.

I mean, it's a totally
gratuitous form of entertainment.

You've obviously never
had a hard on Valerie.

No, I can't say that I have.

You're getting very sleepy.

Very sleepy.

Now you go back through the white light,

back through the akashic records.

Back to the attic of your soul,

just like a high school year
book laid out in front of you

with all the memories of your past lives.

Oh Hugh, it was you.

(speaking in foreign language)


Oh Hugh it's been so long.

I just think I'll have to give
you a little French lesson

that you'll never forgot.

Oh Sally.

Are you sure this is French?

I always thought it was Latin.

Oh you just hold your horses there Hugh.

Or I'm gonna give you a
crash course in Greek.

(moans) Frankly my
dear I don't give a damn.

What's my toilet training

got to do with my aversion
toward cunnilingus?

Are you two talking
about me behind my back?

No, we were just discussing
Ron's personal eating habits.

Valerie listen, can I have
a word with Ron alone please.

Sure.

Maybe a little lip service
will do you both some good.

Ron.

I want all the lingerie I
left at your apartment back.

I, I'm sorry Gina.

I washed my car this week

and I didn't have anything
else to dry it off with.

What?

You pig.

You lose, those are my
favorite underthings.

I'm sorry.

Look, Gina this is probably
bad timing on my part but,

I want us to get back together again.

Oh after you use my personal things

to buff the bumper of your car?

Not.

Quinn University students.

The Quinn University
staff of oral surgeries

in conjunction with

the Lovelay Center of International
Post Orgasmic Research

would like to invite
all interested parties

to an open symposium at dormitory 17.

All hormonally charged students
with proclivity towards

literal stimulation are encouraged

to participate in the study.

Those without oral inclination
are urged not to apply.

Since the reputation of
our esteemed University

hinges on the unimpeachable authenticity

of our research experiments,

three Nobel Laureate neuro-surgeons

will monitor brain wave activity

to verify that none of the
participants orgasms are faked.

Pretzels and mouthwash will be
served immediately following

the final climax of the evening.

â™ª The power, the glory,
it's calling my name â™ª

â™ª I won't stop to play that game â™ª

â™ª 'Cause I'm proud to be loud â™ª

â™ª Proud to be loud â™ª

Do you really think this itching powder,

is it necessary Nurse Hatcher?

I'm appalled at the rampant promiscuity

at these dorm 17 parties.

Ah.

Someone's got to put a stop to it.

Yeah I'm afraid that's
like trying to stop

Oh look, someone else is

[Nurse Hatcher] Did you see who it was?

No, no one ever sees, but
don't worry he'll be out soon.

Listen,

how would you like to go out
back and get a little dinner,

have some on your way home.

Or something else.

Cupcakes or cookies?

How did you know I
was just thinking about

getting some cookies.

Well, I'd like to say that

I've grown psychic in my old age

but in truth I've heard
your stomach growling,

it's something I learnt in med-school.

Unfortunately that wasn't
my stomach you heard.

This lad standing behind

I tell you it reeks.

â™ª Gonna put the hell on you â™ª

("The Night Is Young" by Fitnessglo)

â™ª From the moment that I saw you â™ª

â™ª I started to adore you â™ª

â™ª A dream come true before my eyes â™ª

â™ª Oh yeah â™ª

â™ª Let's not wait another minute â™ª

â™ª We have each other let's begin it â™ª

â™ª 'Cause life's too short to compromise â™ª

â™ª Oh yeah â™ª

â™ª I just can't wait to get
you all alone tonight â™ª

â™ª We'll make each minute count â™ª

â™ª Until the morning light, yeah â™ª

â™ª The night is young â™ª

â™ª We're all alone, oh yeah â™ª

â™ª The night is young â™ª

So you're studying to be

an eye, ear, nose and throat doctor?

Yeah so tell me Rhonda,

when was the last time you had a check up?

â™ª Well I'm trying to figure out you â™ª

â™ª But there's something that's about you â™ª

â™ª That always brings me to my knees â™ª

â™ª Oh yeah â™ª

â™ª In the magic of the moment â™ª

â™ª 'Cause when I can't control it â™ª

â™ª When you do those things to me â™ª

â™ª Oh yeah â™ª

â™ª I just can't wait to get
you all alone tonight â™ª

You have beautiful eyes Rhonda.

Thanks doc.

What'd you say your name was again?

Tony.

Oh I have a terrible time with names,

especially when I start to get drunk.

Uh huh.

Let's see how the ears are doing.

Oh what beautiful earrings you have here.

Is this is a new examination procedure?

I'm prepping the lobe region

for a new experimental technique

aimed at loosening the libido.

You know what that means Rhonda?

(whispering drowned out by music)


I call it dirty talk therapy.

Oh it's more like filthy talk therapy.

You should wash your
mouth out with soap doc.

I have a better idea.

[Announcer] Resident
nurse Cleo Theraidus

your presence is requested

in the post-labic facility immediately.

Resident nurse Cleo Theraidus.

(rock music)

This is called the Eskimo exam.

Hmm, take me to your igloo
Doctor Nanook of the North.

Yeah, the nasal passages

seem to be in perfect running order.

What about my throat?

Aren't you gonna check my throat doc?

Now that.

That's something I'm afraid

we might have to delve
into a little deeper

to get to the root of the problem.

That's if it's okay with you?

You're the doctor.

[Announcer] Your test
results are nine, six, nine.

Good reading Cleo,

please report to the cardio-vascular unit

to assist in a quadruple bypass.

(audience applauding)

(upbeat pop music)

The punch is good tonight,
aren't you having any?

No I'm on a very strict diet.

Fruits, vegetables and goat water.

Goat water?

Yeah water that's been strained

through the beard of an alpine goat.

It's very high in calcium.

â™ª Tell me now â™ª

â™ª I would've made all of this â™ª

â™ª But now it's time for face to face â™ª

â™ª With someone else â™ª

[Tony] Rhonda.

I think it'll be in your best interests

to undergo a complete physical.

[Rhonda] How long do
you think it will take

to perform this physical?

Depends on the erectability variable

of the examining doctor.

So why'd you break up
with your boyfriend Gina?

Well he couldn't satisfy me in bed.

You know Ron had no problem
with me giving him head

for half an hour,

but when it came turn to
reverse the polarities

he complained about terminal lockjaw.

So Ron why did Gina
break up with you man?

I don't know,

beats the hell out of me.

[Announcer] Thank you.

Your lab report is eight, nine, seven.

A very respectable showing Lisa.

Dr. Schullhuster would like
to see you in his office

to go over your statistics one more time.

â™ª Put the head on you â™ª

â™ª I feel my temperature rise â™ª

â™ª You make me sweat â™ª

â™ª You give me something
that body can't forget â™ª

â™ª You make me sweat â™ª

â™ª My bodies on fire but I'm dripping wet â™ª


Oh.

I'm terribly sorry.

No, no, it's not your fault.

Oh do you mind love please.

Oh let's just see if I can't do a job

of mopping this up for you.

[Glasses] You certainly
do a very thorough job um?

Sally.

Listen Sally, there's a room upstairs

that's a little more private.

Maybe you could do a more
thorough job of mopping me up?

Oh yes dear.

See you know what I mean.

I wouldn't worry about Gina at all,

I mean there's just too
many fish in the sea.

Yeah it looks like
those two are about to go

scuba diving huh?

Well I wouldn't mind snorkeling up

one of their Great Barrier Reefs.

Yeah me neither.

â™ª You make me sweat â™ª

â™ª My bodies on fire but I'm dripping wet â™ª

Hey I wouldn't drink that if I was you.

Why not, you think maybe one of 'em

coughed a lugie in it or something?

No, Four Eyes McConaughey
dumped an aphrodisiac

in the punch bowl.

Oh come on Lester.

There's no such thing as a real
aphrodisiac, you know that.

Okay, I'll remember you said that

when you're dry humping
the furniture later on.

I am definitely getting
buzzed off this punch (laughs).

I think I'll take a pass on the punch.

Yeah that's a good idea.

[Ron] Not that I think
there's an aphrodisiac in there

or anything, I just think that.

Whoa, hello.

[Lester] (laughs) What'd I tell ya?

â™ª You make me sweat â™ª

There's some fucking flowers.

You know to tell you the truth,

I haven't missed Ron a bit

since I've been making
it with Carravaggio.

Ooh Carravaggio, is he Italian.

Made in Taiwan.

Taiwan?

Yeah Carravaggio is
what I named my vibrator.

Your vibrator (laughs).

Yeah.

Oh my god I should've known.

I got a nine incher at home I call Spud.

Spud (laughs).

â™ª My bodies on fire and I'm dripping wet â™ª

You know Ron woman
have a much harder time

getting over relationships than men do.

Yeah.

Gina's probably crying her
eyes out right about now.


Spud (laughs) that's classic.

Maybe we should all go out
on a double date sometime.

You, me and Carravaggio.

Aha and Spud.

[Announcer] Your test
results are 10, six, eight.

Tying you with the other two participants.

Since these results are not conclusive,

the panel of examiners has
requested the three of you

to come back for more thorough
examination at another time.

(upbeat rock music)

â™ª I've been in love â™ª

â™ª A few times before â™ª

â™ª Even though it ends
up breaking my heart â™ª

â™ª I come back for more â™ª

â™ª And when I met you â™ª

â™ª I felt it right away â™ª

â™ª That we had something you and me â™ª

Oh god, Valerie I don't know
what's coming over me but,

even the dorkiest guys are
starting to look doable.

Come on get a hold of yourself Gina.

Okay.

[Valerie] I didn't mean like that.

Oh sorry.

Stop that.

â™ª We just can't stop and
quit it between me and you â™ª

Hmm, that's quite a big head

you got on that beer there big boy,

need any help making it go down.

Well.

â™ª And my heart starts a pounding â™ª

â™ª When you smile it's perfectly clear â™ª

â™ª Someday soon â™ª

â™ª You'll stay with me â™ª

â™ª You'll be making me the happiest girl â™ª

â™ª That there ever could be â™ª

â™ª It's getting stronger every minute â™ª

Dean Crawley and Nurse Hatcher are here.

I know, I know and if
they see what's going on

our asses are grass.

Look, we've gotta find Four
Eyes and whip up an antidote.

â™ª It's getting stronger every minute â™ª

â™ª A magic feelings in it â™ª

â™ª We just can't stop and quit it â™ª

â™ª Between me and you â™ª

Young man, what on earth
is going on out there?

Um.

That's a new dance craze.

That's the uh, the horizontal lambada,

Whatever happened to those nice dances

like the fugue and watusi?

Uh yeah.

Jeez.

Oh I want you.

Oh take me.

Ravish me.

I relish the thought.

What? What?

Look Dean Crawley and
Nurse Hatcher are here man.

You've gotta come up with an antidote

for the aphrodisiac quick.

Can't it wait a few minutes?

Can't you see I'm in
the middle of something

very important here.

Oh god.
Yeah, yeah, but look

Look if we don't do something now,

the whole dorms gonna get expelled

and we will never become doctors.

Battle stations.

[Announcer] Attention
all hospital personnel,

please stand advised
that emergency procedures

must be implemented in
dormitory 17 immediately.

Why are they throwing
condoms out on the dance floor?

That's a safe sex drill.

A safe sex drill?

We do it at least once a week,

it keeps us in a constant
state of preparedness.

Oh.

â™ª It's getting stronger every minute â™ª


Gina think of what this
could do to your reputation?

Would you like to dance?

Yes.

(rock music)

Oh yes.

Red pepper sauce.

[Lester] Red pepper sauce coming up.

[Ron] Bella have you seen Gina?

Yeah she just went up to
the tunnel with local Tony.

That prick, I'll kill him.


Come on boys hurry it up.

Quick, quick the mosquito pump.

Okay, go ahead blast it.

What am I doing here?

Philosopher's have
been asking that question

since the dawn of time.

Excellent, the antidote works.

We don't have any time to philosophize.

If we don't get it on the
dance floor right away,

we are all gonna be royally screwed.

â™ª You're so vain â™ª

â™ª You can feel my emotions â™ª

â™ª Sure to deliver â™ª

â™ª Will I keep offending â™ª

â™ª Can't you see â™ª

â™ª Hit and run â™ª

This is what I like to see.

Med students having good clean fun.

("Proud to be Loud")

â™ª One dose of Valium â™ª

â™ª That's all it took â™ª

â™ª I've seen it, I've done it â™ª

â™ª I've heard it before â™ª

â™ª Now it's my turn â™ª

â™ª To settle the score â™ª

â™ª I'll sing it, I'll shout it â™ª

â™ª I'll say it again â™ª

â™ª I don't care if they
never give in 'cause I'm â™ª

â™ª Proud to be loud â™ª
