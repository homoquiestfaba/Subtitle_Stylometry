It's just us now, guys.

I'll always love and protect you.

You'll always be my baby boys.

But I won't be around forever.

So you have to learn
to take care of each other.

You have to protect each other.

Don't ever forget that.

<i>You think you know what's real,</i>

<i>but you don't</i>.

Oh, maybe we should go back now.

You should relax.

Did you hear that?

If you mean the blood rushing to my crotch,
then yes, I heard it.

I know you heard that.

God, Lori.
What if it's Travis?

He knows we're together.
We don't need to rub it in his face.

I'm not rubbing anything
in anybody's face.

I'm just making out
with my girlfriend.

Why are you so worried
about Travis?

I think he's been pretty cool
about everything.

I'm just finding it hard to believe
he's gotten over it so fast.

Because there's just no getting over you?
No. You jerk.

It's just stuff he used to say.

Like what?

It doesn't matter.

Look, I'm just not sure this little trip
was a good idea.

Do you want me to do something?
God, no!

Don't make any trouble, okay?
Then relax.

He's with Nadine now, all right?

He's over you, okay?

Do you want me to take a look around?
Yeah.

Jesus! Henry, you scared
the crap out of me.

Shut up.

I didn't say anything.

Did you... come here by yourself?

You like to keep
an eye on me, don't you?

There you are.
I'm sorry if he's bothering you, guys.

He must have wandered off
while we weren't paying attention.

No problem, man.

I was really worried
for a minute there, buddy.

What are you guys doing
all the way up here?

We just needed to grab
something from the car.

And... got it.

And it's okay, Henry.
I know you didn't mean to scare me.

Dude, I offered. Well, I said,
"Whose is this?" That's kind of like offering.

Are there bears around here?

Yes, there are.

They're black bears.
Tigers.

They won't eat much.

I don't think you have to worry about tigers
at this time of year.

They tend goats out here.

That's scary.
You afraid of goats, man?

I think maybe they should
be afraid of you.

Are you on crack?

Oh, sorry.

Let's play a game or something.

Yeah, that's a good idea.

What?
I don't know.

How about "Hide the Sausage"?

Perv.

How about "Flashlight Tag"?

Oh, my God! I haven't
played that in so long.

Yeah, that'd be so fun.
That'd be so gay.

Come on.
Comin' from a dude in those pants?

What? They're Levis.

I guess it's just how tight they are
that make 'em look like Jordache.

Come on. I want to play.

I'll get the flashlight.
Okay, come on.

Watch your step.

I got it.

You okay, pal?

Be careful! Oh, my gosh!

Uncle Greggie's comin' to town,

and he's liquored up
and pissed off.

Oh, we got a climber.

You suck.

Save some for Daddy.

Hey.

I love a woman that can hold her liquor,
you know what I'm sayin'?

So, you wanna go
back to the tent?

Sure.
All right.

God, I hate being "it. "

I can hear you.
You're gonna be "it," whoever it is.

Don't! It's cold.

So...

warm it up.

Hello?

We're done playin', man.

We're kinda busy in here.

Oh, shit!

He killed them.
What?

They're all dead.
He killed them!

What are you talking about?
What happened, Travis?

Henry... he killed them.

Henry?

Oh, God, Travis, you've got blood
all over you. Are you hurt?

I don't think so.

Let's get a blanket on him.

Are you sure they're dead?

I don't know.

Look, just stay with him.

What do you mean?
What are you doing?

Wait, where are you going?
We gotta get outta here.

We gotta get some help.
What if they're still alive, Sarah?

We can't just
leave 'em out there.

Travis, what happened?
Why would Henry do this?

Bobby and I got into a fight,

and Henry...
he just lost control.

Is he still up there?

He ran away.

Hike back to the car,
take Travis and get some help.

Wait a minute.
We're not leaving you here.

All right. Just stay here.
No, wait, wait.

Take a weapon or something.
We don't have any weapons.

What about that ax you guys
were using to cut firewood?

All right.

Where is it?

Travis, do you know
where the ax is?

Henry had it.

Who's there?

What happened?

Oh, my God, honey. It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you some help.

Oh, my God. Greg,
you gotta get us out of here.

I gotta find out if Bobby and Lori are still alive.
I can't just leave 'em out there.

Oh, my God.
This is so fucked up.

Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

It's okay.

I'm gonna help you.

There's nothing to be afraid of.

If I was gonna hurt you
or turn you in,

I would have already done it.

Right?

That's it.

Try to relax.

My name's Al.

I think you got a break
in that arm.

Put a in-bush cast on it.
Should do the trick.

Ever had any of this stuff?

Well, it's a good time to start.

Come on. Have a sip.

Sorry.

Not used to pouring
into someone else's mouth.

You okay?

Good. Have some more.

That was some fall you took.

With all that blood on you,
I thought you were dead for sure.

But that's not all
your own blood.

Is it?

It's okay. We can talk
about that later. Here.

Right now, we gotta
clean up these wounds.

Don't worry.

I've done this before.

Mostly to myself.

Whiskey should help.
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

It's still gonna hurt.

Not any worse than that fall though.
I can guarantee you that.

You just try to hold still.

If you move, it'll make it worse.

You're a tough kid, Henry.

Toughest I've ever seen.

Well, your modeling career
might be over,

but you're gonna
heal up okay I think.

Here.

Don't worry. It's just water.

Oh, you like that?

Be my guest.

We got something in common,
you and me.

I'm not talkin' about the whiskey.

Do you know what
I am talkin' about?

I'm talkin' about this.

I'm talkin' about what's behind that.

Oh, I got somethin' for you.

Some interesting stuff in there.

I like the ones of that woman.

Is she your mom?

They've already
started lookin' for you.

They'll be here soon.

Now...

as I see it,
you got three options.

You can keep runnin'.

If you do that, you'll either die out here
or they'll catch you.

You can turn yourself in.

If you do that,
they'll put you away for sure.

You won't go home to your mom,
I can guarantee you that.

Or you can stay with me.

I can hide you
so they won't find you.

They'll come and talk to me and
I'll tell 'em I don't know anything.

Then they'll take me to town
and ask me again

and I'll tell 'em
I still don't know anything.

And then they'll just
go away eventually.

I can teach you how
to survive out here.

I won't judge you, Henry.

That's what I heard them
call you, right? Henry?

Well, I won't judge you.

We can look out
for each other.

I got no time
for most people.

Most people are weak
and they judge you on... this.

Or they judge you
on one action...

rather than what's
in your heart.

I know what's
in your heart, Henry.

I saw it out there.

I see it in your eyes.

You gotta decide right now.
They'll be on top of us soon.

What's it gonna be?

I'll bring you
food and water when I can.

You can't ever step foot out of here
until I come and get you.

Okay?

Afterwards, no light at night.

And no fires ever.

The smoke will give away
your position.

It'll get cold in here at night,

but you're a tough kid.

Right?

You understand all that?

It's gonna be okay.

Trust me.

Come in.

Hey.

How you doin', man?

Did she talk to you?

Your mom?

She hasn't been talkin' much.

She didn't say much to us either.

We just stopped by to see
if you wanted to go grab a bite.

You know,
get out of the house.

You know how his face
got like that?

You mean Henry?

Yeah.

No. I mean,
we know he got burned.

One of Mom's boyfriends
was fighting with her

and got pretty rough,
more so than usual.

He knocked her unconscious.

I wasn't here for this one,
but Henry was.

Henry jumped on him, started
really going into the guy.

Tore one of his ears nearly
all the way off his head.

The asshole
grabbed a pot of water

that was boiling on the stovetop
and tossed it into his face.

Oh, my God.

That was the only time I've ever seen
Henry do something violent.

The only time.

Hey, none of us saw it coming.

They stopped lookin' for him,
you know.

They found his shirt
and one of his shoes.

We're really
sorry about all this.

It's hard to know what to say.

But you know that you can call us anytime
and we'll be there for you.

Yeah, anytime.

Thanks.

You wanna grab something
to eat with us?

Okay, we'll stop by
later in the week.

Okay?

Ow!
Get over there!

Henry! Henry, what are you doing?

Thanks.

Travis.

Yeah?

It's not your fault, honey.

It's not your fault.

You better get that look
out of your eyes, boy.

You think I like doing that?

I would expect you to know the difference
between violence and discipline.

Some people got it comin'.

I told you no lights at night!

I told you that to protect you!

You said you understood,

but you still used the light at night!

I saw it, Henry!

That's disrespect!

That is disobedience!

We will not survive out here if you can't listen
to me and do what I tell you to do.

Do you understand that?

Okay.

You have to show me
some respect

and follow the rules
that I lay down.

It's the only way we'll
make it out here together.

It's been over three months now.

They're not even talkin' about it at the store
or on the street anymore.

They're on to the next headline.

Ah, they forget.

But they never forgive, Henry.

They never forgive.

That's why we're out here.

I want you to wear this
from now on.

At least when I'm around.

Go ahead. Put it on.

I did a lot of work in that.

It's not too uncomfortable, right?

You know I care about you, Henry.

And I like being around you.

But you don't have to look at that face
all the time like I do.

You okay?

When's it gonna stop?
Do they think I don't notice?

What were they doing?
Tell me what happened.

I didn't do anything and I don't want to be
treated like a fucking murderer!

How long is this gonna go on?
Were they staring again?

They don't just stare, Mom!

Okay, honey.
I'm not doubting you.

I'm at the store

and I can hear them
on the other side of the aisle.

I'm not making it up.
I'm not imagining it.

I believe you.

<i>You should leave here, honey</i>.

<i>You know,</i>
<i>you're done with school</i>.

<i>You could be closer to work</i>.

<i>There's no reason to stay here</i>.

<i>You're not your father, Travis</i>.

<i>And you're still</i>
<i>young enough to start over</i>.

<i>You can leave all this behind you</i>.

Shit, you guys,
there's a weird man over there!

Get off him right now!
You're dead, dude!

Bobby, get off of him!
Stop it, you guys!

Get off him!

Henry!

Here you go.
Hey, thanks.

I can't believe
you actually have a pool.

Yeah, well, it's paycheck to paycheck
as long as I'm renting this place.

Well, you gotta let us come swim.

We promise we won't pee in it.

You guys can come over any time
you'd like for a small membership fee.

You picked
a great neighborhood, man.

We drove all around here
when we were looking for a place,

but there was nothing available.

You're gonna like it here.

To new beginnings.
Cheers, man.

Excuse me.
Sorry to bug you,

but I'm looking for this address,
and I can't find the street.

I know I'm close.
Let me see.

Oh, you are close.
It's a cul-de-sac.

Go down to the end of this street,
take a left and keep looking to your right.

It's the second or third street.
You can't miss it.

You'd be surprised.
Want me to show you?

No, I'm just kidding.
I'm sure I'll find it now.

Okay.
Have you lived here long?

A couple months. Why?

I'm supposed to be looking at a rental.
That's what this address is.

It's a pretty good neighborhood.

No problems so far.

You look like
you could be trouble.

Yeah, I'm wanted in 49 states.

This is my last hope.

How do you feel about roommates?

Roommates?
Just one.

I don't know. I just got
out of the roommate thing.

I have a pool.

I'm listening.

The bedrooms
are about the same size.

Right, so we can just
split it down the middle.

You don't have any unusual habits
I should know about, do you?

I'll only sell crack
from my side of the house.

Cool.

And even if one of us becomes
attracted to the other,

we keep things platonic
so it doesn't get weird.

Absolutely.

We have a deal then.

Deal.

Take off your helmet.

It's okay. Take it off.

You know what the hardest part
of bein' a father is?

It's bein' a second-class parent.

That's what we are, you know.

Fathers.

Second-class parents.

Get a divorce,
the kid lives with the mother.

Kid goes to jail,
it's the father's fault.

I swear to Christ, a woman could set her child
on fire and get a second chance.

We make one mistake...

and it's over.

I was a good father, Henry.

I know you don't know
where your father is, but I...

I'll bet you, at some point...

he was misinterpreted.

Forced to do something
he didn't want to do.

I can guarantee you that.

You're a smart kid, Henry.

I know you understand a lot.

I know you understand
that without me,

you'd be in a very
bad place right now.

I also know you understand how much
I've sacrificed to keep you here with me.

Most importantly,

I know how much you understand protecting
the people who treat you right

and love you,

and punishing the people
who treat you wrong

and hurt you.

I have a map
I want you to look at.

They'll be looking for me soon.

They'll wanna ask me
some questions.

You have to go back to the cave.

What's happening, brother?
How are you?

Good to see you, man.
Good to see you.

Good to meet you.
Finally.

This is Greg.
Hey, heard a lot about you.

Me too.

You look like hell, man.
Can I get you a beer?

Dude, I am beer, all right?

So you understand then?

Yeah, I guess. I just thought
you'd want to share it with her.

No, Lorraine's the first girl
I've met in a long time

who doesn't know
anything about it.

I love that.

I love the freedom to decide.

She just knows
what I want her to know.

And I like it that way.

That's why I moved down here.

She thinks Henry died
in a car accident?

Yeah.

Okay. It's your decision.

I'm behind you
whatever you want to do.

Thanks, man.
I better get back out there.

You can be anything
you want to be.

Come on, Dave.

Come on, man. We been hikin'
out here for over two hours

and we haven't even
seen a snake.

We're not even supposed to be huntin'
out here, let alone without a license.

Come on. Let's just go home,
all right?

Just admit this was a bad idea
and let it go, man.

Look, I don't hunt in some forest where there's
50 other drunk guys with guns, all right?

We're breakin' a few rules, but this is war,
man. There are no rules in war.

It's not war, it's sport killin'.

But I'm at war with Kim right now,
and I can't kill her so I gotta kill something.

Got any more of that gum?

I'm serious. I'm tired and I think
we may be lost. Let's get the hell out of here.

I'm not lost and I didn't come
this far to not kill something.

All right.
Well, here's the deal.

I'm staying right here.

I'm gonna park my ass against that tree
and have a little candy bar

and maybe take a little nap.

And since you're not lost,
you can find me on the way back.

And don't shoot me.

You got it.

Here, bunny, bunny, bunny.

Son of a bitch.

I'm sorry.
Is this your land?

Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

Mikey! Mikey!

Get up!

Man. I did fall asleep.
What's up?

Dude, I think
we should get out of here.

I just ran into some fucked-up
looking guy with a hatchet.

Well, so what? You got a gun.
I don't wanna shoot him.

I don't even know if he's dangerous,
but what if it's his land?

We should get out of here.
Now look who wants to go home.

Help me!

Help me!

Help!

Help!

Help!

Oh, God. Come on.

Come on, come on!

Shit!

Oh, God. Thank God.
You gotta help me, mister.

There's some
fuckin' lunatic out there.

He killed my friend.
We gotta get some help.

Take it easy.
Everything's gonna be okay.

Sorry, pal. I really am.

But some people got it comin'.

I wanna go home.

People are gonna come
look for those men.

They had to have parked
somewhere around here.

Sooner or later, someone will find their car
and start lookin' around.

Good-bye, Henry.

We'll be partners and
you guys can be partners.

Well, actually, you're gonna need a teammate
because it says, "Choose teams. "

That's how you start.

Oh, God. Okay, okay,
the hint is... it's a thing.

That's very helpful.

You can't spell it out! You're cheating!
I'm sculpting.

No! No, no, no, no.
This is legal.

You gotta sculpt...
Take a guess!

That was D.N.A.

How are you supposed
to sculpt D.N. A?

Well, obviously, you didn't.
Okay, okay, my turn.

Really?
He so totally has it.

You're good.
The colon?

Am I close?

The cheat book.
Hitler! It's Hitler!

Between the nose
and the mouth, that thing.

Oh, my God. You suck at this.

It's okay.

Moustache?
Yes!

Is it our turn?
Yeah.

I got this one. I got it.
Why does it look like Hitler?

He's got a very famous moustache.
I figured you'd be familiar with it.

Hello?

What?

Well, what happened?

What's wrong?
What happened?

Mom's sick. She's in the hospital.
What do you mean, sick?

She just collapsed.
They don't know what's wrong yet.

Sooner or later
it catches up to you.

I saw it coming
and I just ignored it.

She's the only person who can make
me feel okay about everything.

Hey.
Hey. I made coffee.

Thanks.

She really wants
to be at home.

Your mom really wants
to be at home.

There's no reason for her
to be at the hospital anymore.

Should we call hospice?

Yeah, okay.

Do you want me to call
from work this afternoon?

Sure. Thanks.

Okay.

I gotta run.

This is what he told my dad.

That's my terminology for getting rid
of the birth controls...

pulling the goalie.

Yeah, of course.

Everything's in
hockey terms, you know.

At least you'll have
a good time going there.

Oh, dear.

Is that the names
you're thinking of?

Now what do you want?
Do you want a boy or a girl?

Just healthy.

I'll give you a hand.
Thanks.

So, I was thinking

that maybe we could do this
for you a couple times a week.

'Cause I know you've been spending
a lot of time with your mom lately.

I thought it might be easier for you
if you didn't have to worry about cooking.

That is unless you think
you'd get sick of us.

I mean, we'd understand
if you wanted to be alone.

You okay?

Yeah. I'll be right back, Sarah.

It's okay.

It's okay. It's nothing.

We're gonna get home and be hungry again.
You know it.

I know it.
You okay, honey?

Yeah. Anybody
want some coffee?

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Travis, you're hurting me!

Travis, stop!

I'm sorry.

Would you please tell me
what's wrong?

God, I know you're upset about your mom,
but don't take your frustration out on me!

Ever since she got sick,
you've... you've shut down.

Would you say something,
please!

I am so sorry about last night.

I don't know
what's wrong with me.

I don't know why I did that.

But I promise you
it will never happen again.

Okay.

I just need you to talk to me and tell me
what's going on in your head, okay?

Okay.

Hey.
Hey.

How you feeling?

Oh, I feel fine.

Good. I want you to feel fine.

Where's Lorraine?

She's in the kitchen.

Oh.

You didn't kill her yet?

What?

You didn't kill her yet?

Why are you saying that?

Mom?

'Cause you're a fuckin' murderer!

Is she talking today?

No.

Trav, can we talk for a minute?

My head is killing me.
I really gotta get some sleep.

Okay.

I think I'm gonna
stay up for a little while.

Have a good night.

He has no idea what's going on.

Wait till he sees
what we have planned for him.

Lorraine?

He doesn't know.

Lorraine, who are you talking to?

Lorraine?

I'm not Lorraine.

No, I don't know why.

I really wanna talk to you
about all this.

No, he's still sleeping.

Can we get together later?

Thanks. God, I don't know
what I'd do without you right now.

I gotta go. Yeah, bye.

Hey.

Who was that?

Just Sarah.

Oh.

How are you feeling
this morning?

Okay.

Are you going to your mom's?

Yeah.

I'll have to meet you there later.

I'm gonna get some groceries.
We're out of everything.

Sure.

Yeah, Mom, that's me.

I'm having...

a lot of trouble right now, Mom.

I really wish you had made me
get some help a long time ago.

I'm really scared.

Is he still here?

Who?

Henry.

No, Mom. Henry's been gone
a long time.

He came to visit me.

That's not possible.

Ah, sure it is.

He gave me this.

Have you been talking to Lorraine?

Did she put you up to this?

No.

Who then? Greg?
It was Greg, right?

This is an old sketch.
Henry wasn't here, Mom.

Yes, he was.

No, he wasn't!

Is everything okay?

Has anybody else been
to visit my mom recently?

No. Why?

Are you sure
everything's all right?

Lorraine!

<i>You know how his face got like that?</i>

Lorraine!

Hey, Tami.
Hi.

Is Travis back there?
No. He left a little while ago.

Oh. Thanks.

<i>You better murder this woman</i>.

No!

Who are you?

I know who they want me
to think you are,

but you can tell Lorraine and Greg
that it's not gonna work.

They think that if I lose it, they can just leave
me behind and live happily ever after.

Right?

Well, I know what's real
and what isn't.

I know you're not real!

I just wanted them to feel some
of the pain that I was feeling.

They don't understand
how we feel things.

I heard them.
They were planning something.

We had to do it, Henry.

I never wanted
Nadine to get hurt.

I never thought
you'd run like that.

It just didn't happen
the way I wanted it to happen.

I'm sorry, Henry.

I swear, I'm so sorry.

I never wanted you to get hurt.

I always looked out for you.

I looked out for you!

We can't let them know
we're watching them.

They hate us, Henry. I heard them say it.
You have to protect me.

That's my hiding place, dude.

Sorry to spoil your plans, Bobby.

You're dead, man! You're fuckin' dead!
Henry!

Stop it!
Henry!

What are you doing?
Look out!

Please, Henry.

I can make this right.

Oh, shit.

What time is it, Tami?

It's... It's a little after 1:00.

Thanks.

Hey.

Hey.

What are you doing?

Just taking care of some garbage.

At 3:00 a. M?

I don't feel much like sleeping.

We need to talk.

We do need to talk.

I know what happened to Henry.

I don't think you do.

I do, Travis.

I know about the camping trip...
Lori and Bobby.

Been talking to Greg, huh?
And Sarah.

I know everything.

Not everything.

Look, this is it.

If you can't open up
to me right now,

then I'm leaving.

I need to know why
you're so angry with me,

why you won't talk
to me anymore.

I wanna know everything.

You gonna get that?

Hello?

No, he's not with us.

Okay, hang on.

Have you seen Greg?
Sarah hasn't seen him all night.

I'm sure he's around.

No, he hasn't seen him either.

Okay, call us back.

She's pretty freaked out.
He never does this.

Well, you never know
what people are gonna do.

What does that mean?

It means you should never make the mistake
of giving someone your trust,

your heart, because you never know
what they're gonna do with it.

Why are you being like this?

Will you please tell me what's wrong?
I can't help you if you don't tell me.

Lorraine, there's so much wrong
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

Please just let me know
what's going on.

What kind of a fucking idiot
do you think I am?

I don't know what you mean.

Oh, please, Lori.
Lori?

You're really scaring me, Travis.

You say you know everything.

You know where my dad is?

You said you don't know
where he is.

He left when you were little.

That's right.
He left when I was little.

Left us, left the state.

Well, now he's
on death row in Texas.

He murdered two women.

I have the same...

problem that he has.

We see things that
aren't there sometimes.

And the trouble is I don't always know
when it's happening.

So I thought maybe you and Greg weren't
fucking each other behind my back.

I tried really hard
to believe that, Lorraine.

But then he kept shoving it
right in my face.

You think Greg and I...

I'm never gonna
get away from this.

I know that now.
It's inside me.

Did you do something to Greg?

Did I do something to Greg?

Greg did something to me!

Did you hurt him?

You really care about him,
don't you?

Good. I want you to.

What did you do?

You really wanna know?

Oh, God.
What did you do?

See for yourself.

Oh, my God.

You're wrong, Travis.
We didn't do anything.

I swear, there was
nothing going on.

It doesn't even matter
what's real now, Lorraine.

I have to do this.

He wants me to.
I owe him that.

I love you.

My baby boy.

It's easier to take down my ass.
It is.

Why don't you pack the tent?
Why? I wanna stay here with you.

You all set?

Did you have fun?

I don't mean to beat
a dead horse,

but you know we can't tell
Mom and Alan about this, right?

Can I see? What, you don't want me
to look at them?

He won't let you.
He's got volumes of those pads.

He won't even let me
look at 'em.

If you change your mind,
I'd love to see them.

Oh, shit.

I'm in trouble, Henry.

This is so messed up. You weren't
supposed to be back till tomorrow.

Well, that's not the point, Travis.
That is the point!

If you came back tomorrow,
you wouldn't know that we went camping

and you wouldn't be upset.

We would have just had a good time
and everything would be fine.

Well, everything wouldn't be fine.

You still did something
very irresponsible.

You should know better than to have him
around a bunch of drunk college kids.

We weren't drunk.
We had a couple of beers.

I'm frickin' 23 years old.
What's the big deal?

Why don't you act like an adult once
in a while instead of a fuckin' baby?

I don't know if
I could trust you now.

Have I ever messed up
before? Ever?

I don't know. I don't know what you've been
doing behind my back.

This is about you not doing
what your mom and I asked.

This is between Mom and me, Alan, okay?
Hey!

I live in this house now too, pal.

Well, I can't do anything about that,
can I, asshole?

You better start showing me a little respect.
I'm only gonna put up with so much!

Now look, I'll talk to him, Alan, all right?
I'll talk to him.

Please.

Yeah, see what good that does.

Hey.

Your brother's really
getting it out there.

Some people got it coming.

Right?

You know, we're never
gonna make it as a family

if you guys don't respect me
and listen to what I say.

Sometimes...

I think it's too late
for him and me.

But you're different.

I know you don't say much,

but I can see it in your eyes.

We have a connection.
Don't we?

An understanding.

I can work with you, Henry.

Maybe you'll turn out all right.

You can go.

Go get the phone, will you?
It's in the garage on the workbench.

Thanks.

Hey, Henry.

Hey.

You know her?

Hey, it's me.
You coming over or what?

No, it's no big deal.

He doesn't have to know then.

She doesn't have to know.

I just wanna talk to you
for a little bit about some stuff.

Okay.

She's coming over.

Come on in.

Hey. What are you doing here?

Lori told me you called her.

Yeah. So?

You gotta stop, man.
Stop what, being Lori's friend?

If that's why you're here,
you can leave now.

I'm not leaving
until we talk about this.

So that's it?

He has to wash the car?

Now he's having friends over
and everything's back to normal?

I'm getting really tired of you questioning
the way I handle my own kids.

You don't handle them.

You don't even understand them.

Travis wanted to go party with his friends and
his fucked-up brother was holding him back.

So he dragged him in the woods
with a bunch of drunk college kids.

That's your interpretation.
No, it's the goddamn truth!

And you're doing
nothing about it.

Henry is not a normal kid.

You can't treat him that way.

You do, and he's gonna snap,
just like his old man.

You should be quiet now.

Lori's not comfortable
being friends right now.

I'll believe that
when she tells me.

What do you think I'm doing here?
You think I'm a mind reader?

She asked me to come
talk to you, Travis.

He sits there all day
watching horror movies

and making all those
fucked-up pictures!

To normal kids,
Henry is a freak.

Don't you ever call him that!

You lost one family.

I'm giving you a second chance.

You gonna blow it again?

Fuck you.

No, fuck you, Alan!

So, what?
You think I'm obsessed with Lori?

You think I'm a stalker
or something?

If the shoe fits.
Fuck you!

I'm just telling you the truth.
That's how you're coming across.

You're creeping her out.

Do we have an understanding?

You think I don't hear
what you guys are saying?

What are you talking about?

I know what
you're trying to do to me.

Well, why don't you do it, Bobby?
See what happens.

I don't know what the hell you're talking about,
but do we have an understanding or not?

No, we don't.

Now get the fuck
out of my house!

Henry, help!

Yeah, well, why can't
you take care of it?

Because I have something called a job, Kim.
You should look into it.

All right, I'll take care
of it when I get home.

Hey.

Can I see, huh?

Oh.

Alan took off to go cool down.

He actually put his beer down
and admitted

that he shouldn't argue
when he's drinking.

I think I might have been right
about this one.

There could just be
a decent guy in there.

Are Travis and Bobby
still in his room?

It's really quiet in there.

I know you've had
a tough time so far,

but that doesn't mean you guys
can't be happy from now on.

<i>I love you so much</i>.
