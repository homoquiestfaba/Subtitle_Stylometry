<i>Alan Ball: What is it about vampires</i>

that people love so much?


Vampires took over the entertainment world.

It talks about our society and our humanity

by looking at monsters.

(growls, barks)

It's the pathos of the human condition,

which is really, ultimately
everybody's search for love.

<i>(music playing)</i>

It's so hard to talk about the
show without talking about sex.

I was just in awe

that I was able to get
this type of opportunity.

It's been the best job
I've ever had in my life.

This was a situation of extraordinary,

sublime talent.

It sort of was this amazing amalgamation

of creativity.

It's changed my life.

<i>Alexander Skarsgard: It's
gonna be very emotional</i>

<i>now that we wrap up the final season.</i>

It'll be a real good-bye.

(tires screeching)

I had a dentist appointment in the Valley.
Oh, God.

I think it was in Encino.
(laughing)

For once in my life I was early

and I had, like, 20 minutes to kill,

so I went into a Barnes & Noble

<i>and I saw a little paperback
by Charlaine Harris,</i>

and the tagline on the front was

"Maybe having a vampire for a
boyfriend isn't such a good idea."

And I thought, "That's funny."

<i>I'd never read any vampire fiction before,</i>

but I could not put it down.

It was funny and smart and
very authentically Southern.

And I'm Southern, so I responded to that.

And I thought, "You know what, this
would make a really good TV show."

Hey, y'all have Tru Blood, for real?

You get vamps in here?

I didn't even think we
had any in Louisiana.

I think the idea of vampires
having come out of the coffin

and trying to assimilate
into mainstream society

is a pretty brilliant idea.

You two need to leave.

All right, fuck you, Billy Bob.

Fuck me?

<i>Ball: It's certainly an angle
on the vampire story that,</i>

to me, when I first read
it, felt incredibly fresh

and it made it sort of mundane,

which I think is what is so great
about her books and about the show.

<i>Deborah Ann Woll: I remember
when they first called me</i>

<i>to tell me that I was cast.</i>

<i>I was alone, I was staying
at a friend's house,</i>

and I remember just wanting
to celebrate so badly

and there was no one there
in this, like, empty house

and just kind of doing this little dance

by myself in the living room.

<i>It was just a dream come true.</i>

<i>Brian Buckner: Casting's
always kind of funny</i>

<i>- 'cause you'll start to doubt the sides.
Ball: Yes.</i>

And then somebody comes
in and makes it work

and then it becomes very obvious.

It's true. Sometimes
you're sitting there going,

"Oh, I thought this scene
worked, but it really doesn't... "

Uh-huh.
"... And I'm gonna have to completely rewrite this."

And then the person comes
in who makes it work.

<i>- Thank God I don't have to do anything.
Ball: Absolutely.</i>

(all laughing)
Thank God I don't have to work any more

than is absolutely necessary.

<i>Lafayette: John, check the catfish.</i>

<i>Ball: I remember the
casting director called me</i>

and she said, "Would you be
interested in Anna Paquin?"

<i>I was like, "Isn't she too big
for this? Would she do this?"</i>

I don't... I'm confused.

<i>They said, "No, she really read
it, she really responded to it.</i>

She'll come in and read for you."

And you did and we made
you jump through the hoops.

A little bit, yeah, but that's fine.

All the jobs I've ever really loved

were the ones that I had
to do some hoop jumping.

Otherwise, what the hell's the point?

I remember being very nervous asking you,

"How do you feel about
dying your hair blond?"

I don't know why, but I
thought you would say, like,

"I'm not gonna do that."
That's really funny.

I know.

I know, and your answer
was like, "Sure, whatever."

(all laughing)

I said I can't guarantee
I'll look good as a blonde,

but I'll totally do it.
(laughing)

<i>Ball: We had a really
hard time casting Bill.</i>

We had actually taken a
couple of people to the network

and they had said, "That's
not the right person."

And I was thinking, "How
are we gonna find this guy?"

I was in London and I
had just returned home

ignominiously with having
been fired from a pilot.

I had just decided that that
was it and I had given up.

<i>I told my manager I didn't
want to read anything,</i>

and then she said,
"Okay, there's one script.

Read this script and I won't
make you read any others."

<i>And that was your script.</i>

That morning I went in... it's the first
time I'd ever done the Southern accent.

I hadn't practiced it.

I just walked into the
casting suite in London

and put myself on tape.

The size of that file was about this big.

It was about the size of a postage stamp.

And the minute I started
watching it, I kinda went,

"Oh, okay, we found him."

(indistinct chatter)

<i>Sookie: Who's that?</i>

Oh, you noticed him, did ya?

No, it's not like that. I just...

Everyone does.

That's Eric.

<i>He's the oldest thing in this bar.</i>

Man: Three, two, one, go!

Ahh!

<i>Ball: I remember the first time I
met you, you had really long hair.</i>

<i>- And the second time...
Not wig long, but like... </i>

No, it was long. You had long hair.

I thought you looked like
a Scandinavian farmer.

Okay.
(all laughing)

Thank you.
You came in to read for Bill.

Yeah, I read the first book

and I was like, "I'm
gonna audition for Bill?

There's, like, a Viking, Swedish guy here."

(all laughing)

"But, hey, why not?" You know?

That was for the pilot.

Eric doesn't show up until the fourth episode.
Right, right.

But when you walked in, I
kinda went, "Oh, that's Eric."

My life sucks.
Tara, don't you be feelin' sorry for yourself.

That's just lazy.
Well, why can't I keep a job?

Maybe because you can't
keep your mouth shut.

Bitch, who asked you?

I'll never forget when I came into
that first scene I did with you

and you just kind of opened
your arms and you welcomed me.

And I cannot tell you
how safe I felt to work

and be okay even though
I was really nervous.


I was like, "Please don't fire me."

(all laughing)
"Please don't fire me."

I still worry about that.


Buckner: I remember their first day.
Yeah, it was down in...

at Alex's Bar.
In Long Beach.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Parking lot in Long Beach.

You had just flown in from...
The Philippines.

Literally just flown in.
Literally.

Went to a fang fitting, went to wardrobe.

They strapped me into that
corset I couldn't sit down in.

<i>Met Anna and Stephen.</i>

Who's the doll?
Pam, this is Sookie.

Sookie, this is Pam.
Pleased to meet you.

<i>Van Straten: And I
remember being so out of it</i>

that you had a line in Swedish...

(speaking Swedish)

... and I remember saying to you,

"Is that Cambodian?"
(all laughing)

And you went, "No."
"Yes."

Yeah! (Laughing)

I'm half Cambodian.
And you probably thought,

"Who is this chick I'm stuck with?"

And I was like, "I think
he's kind of serious."

(all laughing)

I don't know if it was the first day,

but one of the days on the pilot

was 4:00 in the morning or something

and you and me and Anna...
And Anna.

... started improving.

Ooh, Sookie.

Chicka-chicka-bow-wow.

It started with this one. He started doing it.
It was fun.

They ain't scared of you, honey child.

They scared of what's between your legs.
Lafayette!

That's nasty talk. I won't listen to that.
(laughs)

It was like we were on some kind
of psychotropic drug or something.

And y'all bitches just don't
know what you're missin'.

I got six gears on these hips.
Uh. Uh. Uh.

No, baby. You don't
know what you're missing.

You can watch it walk away.
Make you wanna slap it?

<i>Preston: And then Lynn starts
slapping herself on the butt.</i>

Yeah, six gears. (Laughing)

I was like, all right, all right, let's go.

Peaches 'n' cream.
And that's when we started doing this.

I'll give you a little cocoa.
A little cocoa.

Peaches 'n' cream and all this stuff.

Take these, baby. Peaches 'n' cream.

<i>- I'll give you a little cocoa.
Arlene: Peaches 'n' cream.</i>

A little cocoa.
The script supervisor turned to me and said,

"They're not anywhere
close to their lines."

And I said, "It's okay."
(laughing)

That's totally okay.

With the nature of the show, too,

because it is not necessarily
that episodic classic

where you sort of go
back to where you start

that we, as actors, have a chance to play

breadth and silence and
live with these moments.

It's about creating yourself.

So that's... which gives you
something of a journey to go towards.

You are one sad, sorry freak, bubba.

Get a grip!

Jesus, tits, and God America, Jason.

What the fuck is happenin' to me?

I have found the writing
consistently to be so self-evident

<i>that what you need to play a scene</i>

is 99.999% built into the scene.

And that's my justification

for why I've never done
any homework on the show.

(all laughing)

That's hilarious.

All of these approaches are equally valid.
Yes.

<i>Joe Manganiello: "True Blood"
fans are the most passionate fans</i>

<i>in the world, hands down.</i>

On the streets of Paris, I'd have someone

<i>point and yell, "Le loup-garou !"</i>

Which is, you know, "The Wolf Man."

<i>Or be in Barcelona, Spain,
and, "El hombre lobo!"</i>

<i>Tara Buck: It's like a
live audience in a way.</i>

<i>I've had people come up to me and tell me</i>

they cannot stand the pitch of my scream.


<i>And then I have people who
come up dressed like Ginger,</i>

and the love and enthusiasm is...

overwhelming.

You do get some crazies
every once in a while

who don't have boundaries and are...

you know, asking you
to lick 'em and bite 'em

and do all of that crazy stuff, so...

but... but, you know, I
wouldn't have it any other way.

I have a lot of fun with it.

<i>Ball: The fans of this show are... </i>

Dedicated.
Yeah.

Passionate.
Nuts.

(all laughing)
Yeah.

<i>Ball: They are a godsend</i>

because they turn...
Without them we don't have a show.

<i>Ball: Yeah, exactly. They turned this show</i>

into the phenomenon that it became

and we love each and every one of them.


<i>Ball: I had never been to Comic-Con</i>

and there were literally like 6,000 people.


<i>Ball: And it hit me that,</i>

"Wow, there's a lot of people
who really like this show."

All: "True Blood!" Whoo!

I love me some...
Together: Sookie.

You mean... (imitates Bill) Sookie.
Sookie.

I'd like to hear it again
one more time, please.

(lowers voice) Sookie.
(audience laughing)

When you're at Comic-Con
it's like you're the Beatles.

I mean, I felt like the
president for half a second.

<i>- (chuckles)
Trammell: You know? It's really a blast.</i>

It's kind of scary, though.


<i>Ball: I got a message
on my Facebook page... </i>

"I am a vampire and I
am not happy with the way

<i>- we are portrayed on the show."
(laughing)</i>

The Kenya airport, I got
recognized and I was like,

"Wow, in Kenya!"

And then she was like,
"Yeah, I love the show."

And I'm like, "Where are
you from?" She said, "Texas."

<i>- I was like...
(laughing)</i>

... that doesn't totally count.
So exotic.

Say, didn't somebody get a speech of
yours tattooed on their ass or something?

Oh... yeah.

<i>- Paquin: Seriously.
You know that speech about magic?</i>

What animates you no longer animates me.

What does animate you, then?

Magic.
Oh, come on, Bill.

I may look naive, but I'm not.

It's probably that big on her back...

<i>- Ball: Wow.
... and it's probably 70 or 80 words.</i>

Just because you understand the
mechanics of how something works

doesn't make it any less of a miracle.

Which is just another word for magic.

I love that the show speaks
to them the way it does

<i>because I think the show
is crazy entertaining.</i>

It is a fun ride.

<i>This is the kind of thing you hope for</i>

is for people to love the show

as passionately and as deeply as they do.

<i>Michael McMillian: "True Blood" broke
some sexual boundaries on television.</i>

It's certainly the first time

I know that my parents have sat down

and watched soft-core
pornography together,

so in that sense it's definitely
broken some boundaries.

Um... uh... sorry Mom and Dad.

<i>Janina Gavankar: The truth
is out there in the world</i>

people are weird,

people get freaky, it's okay. (Laughs)

<i>Ball: "The horrors of
intimacy," I have to admit,</i>

is a phrase I pulled out of my ass

when somebody at HBO...
basically I was on the phone

and they said, "In one sentence
tell me what this show is about."

And I kind of went, (stammers)

"the horrors of intimacy."

(laughs)
And he said, "Okay."

I would not have been able
to pull that out of my ass.

No.
That's pretty good.

And ultimately, I think, that
actually is what this show is about.

How could a show about the horrors
of intimacy not address love

and being in love and what that means?

Because to me vampires are
kind of a metaphor for sex.

You know, I read in "Hustler"
everybody should have sex

with a vampire at least
once before they die.

<i>(music playing)</i>


Every character in the show
has gotten a chance to sort of

fall in love, get their heart broken,

pick up the pieces, and keep going.

<i>Buckner: It's also when
you take a human life</i>

and measure it against a vampire life.

<i>- Vampires can have so many loves...
Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>... over the course of their lives</i>

and humans have less
time to have those loves.

So it's things like that
that we're playing with.

What was so wonderful about
getting this character,

the beauty and the poetry in
it, is that he falls in love.

For the first time in 140 years,

I felt something

I thought had been lost to me forever.

<i>Moyer: There is something about this girl</i>

that is completely
different from anything else

and it rekindles the possibility of hope.

I love you, Sookie Stackhouse.

I love you, too.

A lot of it seems to me to be
about Sookie's sexual awakening.

<i>You know, the whole... she's a fairy,</i>

but metaphoric for her power as a woman.
Absolutely.

<i>(music playing)</i>

<i>Preston: She's definitely
had her fair share of learning</i>

through sex in the show.
She has.

Yes, she has.
Arlene, not so much.

Um...
(Ball laughing)

You know, in an orgy with black contact lenses.
I remember that.

That was a good sex scene.
(laughing)

(music playing)
(people moaning)

<i>- Buckner: The night of the orgy.
Oh, God.</i>

Which orgy?
(laughing)

<i>Buckner: There was just
this moment where Alan and I</i>

were sitting behind the monitors

<i>and we kind of couldn't believe</i>

how fucking out of control
this thing had gotten.


I think whole relationships were had

within the three days of that.

I saw a lot of things that
I cannot burn from my memory.

Cannot unthink.
Yes.

(speaking Greek)

The thing about Maryann
is what she was preaching

was basically a life of sensual fulfillment

with no guilt and no shame.


There is actually something
kind of appealing about that

because, I mean, wouldn't it
be great to just sort of, like,

let some hot, sexy
creature just devour you?

Okay, we don't want that to happen in real life.
Really?

(laughs)
Well, some of us don't.

But I think, in a way, the show lets people

sort of vicariously experience that

through all the crazy things
that happen to all the characters.

<i>Buckner: That's part of
why the finale is daunting.</i>

As the person tasked with
bringing this thing home,

I'm very conscious of
bringing it back to a center.

I think we had a lot of wild sex.

<i>We really let go of convention,</i>

but I think people will sort of feel like

this was a love story
at the end of the day.

What about a song and dance number?

People love song and dance numbers.

They love that. Let's chuck
the finale and just do that.

That always works.
Yeah.

When in doubt...
Are you game?

Bucky, you know I'm game.
Okay.

<i>(music playing)</i>


The villains on this show
have never been "just evil."

Everybody has something
primal inside of them.

You know, how many of us would
love to, like, just... you know,

somebody pisses us off, wouldn't
it be great just to behead them?

A lot of times there's
good and there's bad.

And good must vanquish bad.

But our show's about all
of the stuff in between.

<i>Skarsgard: That's what... I had
so much fun with Eric's character.</i>

He's presented as the "bad guy."

People are quite lazy in a way,
or they want to be fed in a way.

It's like, "Okay, easy... good
guy, bad guy and the girl, great."

And you eat your popcorn.

<i>But then when Godric appeared,</i>

you realize, "Wait a
minute, he actually cares

about this guy and
there's warmth in there."

Godric.

<i>Skarsgard: I find that
dramatically very interesting</i>

because then people go, like,
"Wait, no, no, no. That was...

I was rooting for this guy,
but this was a bad guy."

Yeah, everybody's done something horrible.

Yeah, we love our vampires, but...

they can be pretty fucking savage.

It's that vampire... Russell...

what's his face?!

Edgington.

Peace is for pussies.

Russell Edgington, as played by

the absolutely extraordinary Denis O'Hare,

is a total badass.

Put your fangs away.

He just had so much fun with that part.

Fantastic!

From watching him do Russell
was just an absolute joy.

Ooh, they will suffer for
their sins, my beloved.

I swear...

Like, he was doing Shakespeare.
Yeah.


We will eat you

after we eat your children.

Now time for the weather. Tiffany?

<i>Moyer: When that episode
went out, the next day</i>

Obama came into a huge press briefing

and opened with, "Did anybody
see 'True Blood' last night?"

<i>- (all laughing)
Trammell: Are you kidding?</i>

Yeah.
Wow.


I like that scene when Sam is the fly

and then he goes inside and then...

<i>- Oh, yeah.
Van Straten: Yeah. That was good.</i>

(growling, gulps)

<i>- Buckner: That was special.
That was amazing.</i>

Longshadow puking in your mouth.

<i>- Moyer: Oh, that was amazing.
Buckner: That was... </i>

Beautiful.
... what I talked about the next day

around the water cooler, for sure.

(gasps)
(screaming)

Ginger, enough.
I asked you if you wanted

my eyes and mouth opened or closed.

<i>Buckner: That's correct.</i>

She's like, "Should I
take it in the mouth?"

<i>- Van Straten: Yeah.
"Should my mouth be open?"</i>

I'm like, "Yes!"
(laughs)

<i>Van Straten: It was a hose
up the side of Longshadow.</i>

And then if you followed the hose,

there was a big orange ladder
with, like, two construction workers

pouring gallons of blood
into this huge funnel,

like shoving it in there.

It felt like it lasted
like a minute or two.

(gasping)
(screaming)

It's scary when you have
that cannon shooting liquid

<i>- 'cause I had that recently.
Paquin: Actually, it's not.</i>

Do you know why? 'Cause nobody
had ever had it before on the show,

so I didn't actually know what was gonna happen.
(laughing)

That was the first time that anyone got...

That was the first fire hydrant of blood.
Yeah.

That was the day I fell for Anna.

Humans. Honestly, Bill, I
don't know what you see in them.

<i>- (Ginger screaming)
(swallows, gasping)</i>

<i>- There's a lot of good deaths.
Skarsgard: Nora's death scene</i>

last year was interesting 'cause
it was a very emotional moment.

And so we end as we begin.

<i>Skarsgard: When I realize
that she's drifting away,</i>

I kind of pick her up...
(gasping)

They switched wonderful
Lucy out with a bag of blood.


A blood balloon.
It's like... yeah.

Like this size, basically.


I have to play the second half of the scene

holding this blood bag

and then it explodes in my hands.

<i>Skarsgard: You're like, "I'm on the
set of 'True Blood' with a blood bag."</i>

Like this balloon, basically.
"Don't leave me."

"No, don't leave me! Don't... leave... me."


When Jessica and Hoyt
first met in my bar...


Hi.
Hi.

... the tension between
them was just wonderful.

How do you know I'm a nice girl?

'Cause of your smile.

That just has always stuck in my mind

as one of the most beautiful,
well-acted scenes in the show.

<i>Lauren Bowles: One of my favorite episodes</i>

was where I got to birth the fairy babies.


(baby crying)
Another girl.

<i>Bowles: Birthing those
babies was great fun.</i>

And my favorite line I've ever gotten
to say was in that episode as well,

where I just got to look at Andy and say...

You're a dick.


The drug trip that Lafayette
and Jesus got to go on.

Your teeth is wobbling.
(laughing)

We actually got to control the camera.

(both shouting, laughing)

<i>We were attached together</i>

and it was on a pole facing towards us.

<i>And so we were spinning
with it and moving around.</i>

Once you see it edited, it looks so trippy.

That was probably one of
my favorite experiences.

Jason.

Thank you so much for
invitin' me into your home.

My favorite scene was where Steve
came out of the closet to Jason.

You know, there's something
that I've been gathering up

the courage to tell you
ever since the moment

I found out you were sleeping with my wife.

What hurt me was that
she got to sleep with you.

<i>McMillian: That was,
really, for the first time,</i>

Steve Newlin revealed who
he was and what his truth was

and what his real feelings were.

I'm a gay vampire American.


And I love you, Jason Stackhouse.

It's insanity!
Our existence is insanity.

<i>Skarsgard: We had about 15 minutes
to shoot Godric's death scene</i>

'cause it was as the sun was coming up.

_

_

<i>Skarsgard: We rehearsed it for three hours.</i>

We blocked it and then
waited till the right time.

When we knew that it was six minutes

<i>before you would see
the sun on the horizon.</i>

Let me go.
(crying)

<i>Skarsgard: That was the only
moment, so far on the show,</i>

where we knew we had three
takes and that was it.

The difficult thing about
really coming to terms

with the fact that this show
is ending is that it's ending.


And, um, it's not another script

or plot point or story line.

It's actually ending.

<i>Buckner: I hope that it is thought of</i>

as more than just
another supernatural show.

Mm-hmm.
Like, I hope that people go, "It said something."

I would love for it to
be remembered as the show

that brought about world peace.

(all laughing)

To me, it's been the most
fun thing I ever worked on.

That's not to say all the
other things weren't fun,

but, this one is the most fun, yeah.

<i>Moyer: I completely concur.</i>

Obviously, I met Anna that first day

and you don't expect to meet the person

that you're gonna get married
to on the job that you're doing

and have as much fun on the job as well.

The first season I was like,

"This set... everyone's so great.

Everyone's so nice and welcoming."

You were like, "This
doesn't happen all the time."

(all laughing)
You were like,

"This is special. This is rare."

And I've just treasured that

the whole seven years.

It's been... I think, being on the
show has meant everything to me.

I felt like I was nostalgic
in the second season.

You know, it's...
(all laughing)

I was already dreading the end then.

It's gonna be very emotional,

I'm sure, now towards the
end of this final season.

<i>Ellis: Yeah, it's gonna
be hard walking away</i>

from Lafayette's shoes.

I'm gonna miss...
I'm sure they'll give you the shoes.

(all laugh)

<i>Ellis: I'm gonna miss the makeup.</i>

I loved, loved, loved, loved,
loved playing Lafayette.

My friends, sometimes, would be like,

"Dude, you walkin' like Lafayette, stop."

(all laughing)

Or out of... all of a sudden I'll be like,

"Well, you know what we gon' do?"

And I go, "Oh, that's a...
that's a Lafayette thing."

(all laughing)

<i>Woll: It'll be really
hard to say good-bye.</i>

Even when a character
dies or leaves the show,

you know, a little piece of you goes,

"Oh, God, I'll never see
that character again."

And a piece of that
will also be sad for me.

<i>Van Straten: It's actually
hard to encapsulate</i>

what being part of a show
like this means to me.

(voice breaking) I'll cry.

My husband was saying,

"That's longer than high
school and junior high."

You know, except we don't
have any of those bad people.

<i>Manganiello: It was a
childhood dream for me</i>

as a kid who grew up watching horror movies

to get to play a monster.

<i>McMillian: I will remember and
miss the people that I worked with</i>

on the show until my final days.

<i>Bowles: This little moment in time has been</i>

an absolute dream...
dream, dream come true.

<i>Paquin: This show has changed my life.</i>

I will miss it terribly.
