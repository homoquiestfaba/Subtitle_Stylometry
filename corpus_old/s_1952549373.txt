So, where is this renowned father?

Will father show his face to you, sir?

A shallow womanizer fashions
himseIf a dashing wit.

Perhaps he cannot hear
your whimpering, sir.

Pathetic palter.

Very quick.

Move.

Some other dog beat us
to the treasure.

Hear that?

No, pIease.

Mercy.

I will serve you.

AbeIar, does it still exist?

AbeIar?

Ah, yes.

RuIed by a queen, EIdoria.

She has passed on.

Her eIdest. . . eIdest chiId Ma'at
is queen now.

Really?

I won't harm the queen,

but I will make you do
with her seed.

Not that it matters now.
I. . . I was wondering...

how. . . how your enemies. . .
To dust.

That will sting.

And now?

And now,

say, ''I won't feeI anything
except a IittIe sting.''

Tanis.

Tanis.

Are you Iistening to me?

Sister.
It is upon us, your dream.

It's happening.

After all of these years, the Sorceress
has somehow returned from the dead.

Levana.

PIease don't go.

Go, Lenor.

PIease, find safety.

All of you Ieave at once.

I will aIert the GeneraI,
Your Highness.

And we must find he
who saved us before.

The Mercenary?

Your father.

But, our father is dead.

He died saving AbeIar
from the Sorceress.

Your father is not mine.

I was sired by the king but...

you. . .

...you were by this mercenary.

Mother said you were
the king's chiId to protect you.

You must Ieave the past behind.

Our kingdom needs us now.

Kingdom Bush is not my father?

No, but he who is Iives.

If we so be separated

mother said this will Iead you to him.

With this token, he will know you
and you shall know him.

And this will heIp you
to understand the sorcery.

My Queen.

They are within the paIace,
Your Majesty.

You must come now.

You have to go.

No, come with us.

My Queen,

you both have a Iong time
to struggIe.

I've trained you well,
Your Highness.

You are ready for what comes.

Stand.

We can make sure of your safety
if you follow this hall.

It will Iead you out of the paIace.

But what about you?

My duty is to remain here, Kara.

No.

If you stay, then so will I.

You can do nothing more here,
Dernier.

The RoyaIs will scheme
to save their skins.

We will be Ieft to fend for ourseIves
and not aIways with the truth.

They have no regard for us.

But I am sworn to. . .

You have sworn to Iove me, Dernier

or was that just to weaken my will.

I Iove you.

Then save us my Iove.

I must kill the infected.
Leave her. She's a friend.

It's your wish.

There, it Ieads to a quay
where our boat waits.

It will take you to Durris.
Durris?

An outIaw city?

If he still Iives the peopIe
there will know his whereabouts.

Tanis,

l'm find

remember what I said.

If we so be separated,
you must find him.

We've run out of time.

Run, Tanis.

But sister.
Hush.

You're not a chiId but
a Princess of AbeIar,

a Ieader with responsibiIities.

Act it.

Find your father.
Save our peopIe.

They count on us, Tanis.

I can't do this aIone.
You must.

Go. Now.

I command you.

Do not Iook back...

...or rest.

It's been what, 20 years?

Where's your mother's Iover?

What was his name again?

It seems to have sIipped my mind.

He has not sIipped mine.

Why, of course.
He sent your father to the Abyss.

I must have thought
of a million different ways

to make you and your mother suffer,

but nothing was ever terribIe enough.

I mean, how do you repay someone

who buried you aIive for 20 years?

Nothing smelled Iike Iife,
Your Highness.

You must be wondering
how is it she is back

Iooking so wonderfully restored.

CIearIy, we watched your destruction.

CIearIy, you shouIdn't have
given the finaI rights

to a high priest with designs
on your throat.

A pity he perished with some
mysterious pIague upon his return.

Who knows what Iives in dust?

And who are you?

Go,

go.

Where is my seat, Your Highness?
I'm not sure.

Kill her.

Get the girI.

The paIace is Iost.

The Queen is dead?
Or worse.

What are they?

Vampires.

But we will not die tonight.

I couId fight harder.

You Ieave the killing to me.

What is to become of us now

or the kingdom?

My master is the son of a race.

But, there is aIways a need
for a pretty servant,

and there is one against me as well.

What is it?
Hush, hush.

Why the guards they are so daunting?

They're trying to kill us.

What?

It is read.

It's my fauIt.
No.

On your Iife run.

I have aIways Ioved you.

I will.

And now, a Iadder across the Abyss
that I might free my father.

In my stead,
you will awaken my seed.

She is the true daughter of my race,
and though haIf human,

she will be human no more.

Ah, Denier.

I'm sorry.
No, you're not.

You used me.

What?

No, I Ioved you.

Really?

Yes, right,

I was using you, Dernier.

You are eviI.

Becoming a vampire isn't even
the worst of me.

That and more.

Are you going to kill me now?

Bite my throat,
drain me of my bIood?

I want you.

I couId soothe you, Dernier.

You couId use someone Iike me

for a sIave.

I have too much over the past.

I will bring victims to you

to fuIfill whatever dark
fantasies you have.

I will do whatever
I have to do for you?

You are a monster.

I will bow to you, Kara.

Kara, bow to her.

Life takes many forms
in many worIds

and she's in her finaI metamorphosis,

her chrysaIis.

Why me?

You are speciaI.

But you've aIways known that.

SpeciaI in a way that no one eIse
couId see untiI it was too Iate.

And even as a chiId,
you have aIways been cunning,

intelligent,

depraved.

You have tried to bIend in

or be a human,

safe,

but even as a chiId you knew
you were different,

filled with dark corruptness.

Are you ready to be free?

You're free now

but not yet fully transformed.

I have pity for those who can waIk in the
curse of Iight and among these creatures.

We have much more work to do
before we can be safe.

I sent the princess to the reefs.

If she's dust,

find her.

Know what she's pIotting,

and most importantIy with whom.

Why me?

Because she will know and trust you
when she's most vuInerabIe.

And if I refuse?

You've hungered for this day
when you couId be who you are

and what you are

to Iet those dark urges free.

Mother said this will Iead you to him.

With this token

he will know you
and you shall know him,

and this will heIp you
to understand the sorcery.

You're not a chiId
but a Princess of AbeIar,

a Ieader with responsibiIities.

Act it.

Find your father.
Save our peopIe.

My princess.

You shouIdn't have been wearing this?

PIease.

You cheated Dog.
What?

Go weep to the gods.

You will die.

I shall cIeave your thick ugIy faces.

No dog cheats me and Iives.

Thankfully, I'm not a dog
but I do Iike to cheat.

Now, I'm gonna have to kill you
Iike a bitch pup.

HoIy shit.

I want this man.

She wants me.

I'll tell you what, wench,

Iet me kill this dog

and then I will bed you so hard. . .

Somebody you want me.

Wench, you've diminished
my reputation.

It couId be diminished, sir?

Why bog me,

did I do your mother, huh,

or, uh, sister perhaps?

The Iast of it,

the Iate great AbeIar
and how it came to be overcome.

Sir.
I mean no disrespect, Iady.

I noticed your cIoak.

It came from the paIace guard.

So, it is.

Like yourseIf, I bareIy escaped
these fouI creatures.

I'm here to spread the word
of what these eyes have seen.

You've seen much.
Aye.

In this one worId.
That's why you're here.

You've seen far too much sir.

Brother and sister?

Different mothers
but a common father.

And you say we were meant
to find our father?

ExactIy. And together
we're to destroy the Sorceress Xia

and return AbeIar to the peopIe.

Uh-huh.

So, Princess, you speak
for the RoyaI House?

That is correct.

How much am I to be paid
to save your precious AbeIar?

Paid?

I didn't mention anything
about a bounty.

We do this because it's right

and just and it's what we shouId. . .
This sword will not be drawn

untiI it received proper compensation.

You disappoint again.

Oh, my Iady,
one night in bed with me and. . .

I'm your sister.

HaIf.

How couId I expect any nobiIity
from a pig Iike you.

Wait.

Look,

your taiI hoIds a certain fancy,

but I am in need of coin and I'm willing
to take your word that there will be a bounty.

What do you know about him?

Well, not much.

Nothing at all.

Nor a trickster?

Aye, but this trickster knows
where our sister may be,

and to her our dear father.

A sister?

Where?

About that bounty?

If your word proves true,

then you shall have it.

I gave you my word.

That shouId be sufficient.

I am called Aedan.

And what are you doing here?

What?
Can't a brother heIp his sister?

After five years?

No.

This comes with some terribIe price.

You're not a woman
with many an option.

There's a fouI tempered undertaker
and eventuaI traitor

wanting to see you skinned at dawn.

And what is this act of brotherIy
Iove going to cost me?

It's more priviIege than the price.

We get to save AbeIar.

I don't think I'm dressed appropriateIy.

PIus, of course, there is a bounty.

And where wouId you
get reaI bounty?

From AbeIar.

She's your sister.

But maybe a...

...IittIe more.

Well, what is your name.

You wouId Iike to sit down
and have a drink with me, huh?

Tell us the taIe, sister.

A fortnight ago
the Sorceress Xia captured AbeIar.

My sister, the Queen, was murdered.

Xia?

Didn't father
put that DeviI wench down

or is that another tall taIe?

Well, cIearIy he didn't put her
permanentIy down,

thus creating an opportunity.

She's back and she's taking AbeIar
with sorcery.

Which is to say she's infested AbeIar.

Don't you have
any conversation for me?

You are so beautifuI.

It's all Greek to me.

She will continue to feed,
to spread her darkness

untiI the next full moon rises.

And then?
Oh, this part is good.

Xia will open the doorway
to the Nether WorIds.

You were saying?

Thus ending our very existence.

It's all so dire.

You see, sister, there's no bounty
too great for saving this worId.

Say we fancy the idea for a moment.

And that there is this massive
bounty in goId, of course.

Aye, what makes you think us three here
can stop this Vampire Queen?

I toId her we're Iovers not fighters.

When need to have a pIan,
something Iess daunting, more rewarding.

I am at a Ioss.
We shouId take the traditionaI action,

and hire mercenaries,
Iike our dear father.

Yes, yes,
but we're under time constraints.

In onIy a fortnight
the moon will be full.

I have a thought.
It was onIy a matter of time.

MaIia, you will find father and see
if he has any ideas on the matter,

and I with what funds to princess
has on her presentIy

will arrange for a dozen armed men.
Not just any men,

no, no, no, but the type with honor
and courage enough to win back AbeIar.

By the gods I've heard that there are
experienced barbarians in nearby Primeria,

preciseIy the type of warriors
that we needs. So, the Princess...

she can wait here at Durris for our return,
you know, hoIding down the fortress

sort of thing.
Or Iet us spIit the funds you possess,

give us both a chance to hire
the best warriors we can find on our way.

Aye, that couId work as well.

Well, sister?

You take me as a fooI at your own periI.

You are both much Iess
than I'd hoped.

At the prison I spoke to the magistrate
and he gave me your recent histories,

theft, assauIt, cheating, embezzIing. . .
Right.

Pick pocket and street whore?
I have never picked a pocket.

You're both are the Iowest
of character,

but my sister was firm
and we must find our father

and you are my onIy hope.

We'll need horses.

I can acquire them.

Are there other brothers and sisters?
Ah, yeah, yeah,

she's a day's ride away
in a village called Chiba

Agreed then to Chiba Village.

Our father still Iives?

I suppose. Last summer he was
carousing in the secret of Nobu.

That was years ago.

The dog is IikeIy dead as a cock, though,
rotting in some dungeon.

50,000 goId pieces.

55
50

50 and that's my finaI word.

And I suggest we seaI this fast.

What's going on, sir?

Having an adventure, sister?

A bitch dog.
Come to Iose again?

It isn't Iong now.

An entire new worId.

I use Xia's body as a conduct.

It's a doorway.

What have you Iearned?

The princess seeks one Iike her father.

The warrior who heIped with Mitadonia.

He can see us fall into the Abyss.

Reduce her to dust.

ShouId I kill them now,

the Princess and these two fooIs?

Learn the whereabouts of this father.

As you wish.

I tried to find father once
right here.

What was it Iike?
Ah, it was Iike this...

except for peopIe trying to kill me.

It's earIy yet.
Maybe they'll remember you.

Oh, MaIia, they wouId
if they were still aIive.

I meant what was it Iike to see him?

I didn't see father.

I found Rajan,

our haIf sister.

Stay put.

What does Rajan do here as a trade?

You mean when
she's not drunk or passed out?

Hello sister.

I have a wonderfuI opportunity for you.

No thank you.

It did not work out Iast time.

It's onIy because you Iack
a sense of humor.

What do you think they seek?

This drink.

Sister toId me great stories
about father...

aIthough I thought she spoke of a hired
mercenary sent to save AbeIar.

That was before I knew
he was my father.

The man who I thought
was my father, the King,

well he was killed by Xia.

You really want to know
who father is, God's truth?

Yes.

Our father is the Iowest
form of cowardIy dog,

a man who takes advantage
of wives or widows,

sells out his cohorts for coin
and runs from a reaI fight.

That's who father is.

What's the matter?

You don't Iike the truth?

You married, have sons?

LuckiIy no.

They're not so bad to Iook at.

Your whores?

Rajan, say hello to your sisters.

More famiIy?
And with your heIp, we four...

will save AbeIar
before the full moon.

The full moon is six nights away.

Time is short.

Ho, an adventure.

AIana

AIana?

I'd forgotten her.

She's all grown and ready
to Ieave this stink hoIe.

AIana, your favorite
uncIe has returned.

Don't you remember me?

I remember.

As formidabIe as she is,
the girI is but a girI.

I meant no offense, niece.

I taught her a few things in my days
as emperor's assassin.

Yes, I can see.

Sir, this is the most serious
and most dangerous mission.

It's the Sorceress Xia we must destroy.

The Vampire Queen.

Yes, and it is not suitabIe for a chiId.
You think I'd be afraid.

Look, it's time my AIana
saw the worId,

had a few wiId, bIoody adventures.

And vampires and sorcery
are all a part of that.

The truth is, she will Iove many

and Ieave many more choking
on their entraiIs.

A sister, heh?

And a princess no Iess.

Do you pIan to rob her?

Give me a IittIe credit.

This comes at a good time.

I was worried.

How so?

With my adventuring
and killing days were behind,

I wouIdn't be abIe to give her
proper parenting.

Oh, betting brutes, horribIe wars,
ghastIy death, and it's all still ahead of you.

I am sure it's all with my daughter.

The gods must choose
to smiIe upon me.

You wouId really cut
my throat back there?

Of course, uncIe.
Yours particuIarIy.

Sweet girI.

What of grandfather?
Might he want to go as well?

Grandfather?

Our father?

Aye. He might crave one Iast good battIe
before setting down the sword?

He's still killing?
Oh, that rascaI, his sword is aIways poised.

Want to meet the oId dog?

Oh, Iet's be off.

There are kingdoms to save
and men to bed.

I prefer wenches.

Then he Iives?

Why not use your sorcery
to destroy them all?

Sorcery hasn't been needed
untiI the full moon,

but it's now needed instead
of your coId steeI, Kara.

Her father was a great sorcerer

callousIy taken by gods

Iet aIone by human

yet this one day.

But how is that possibIe

against their power?

Because there exists a breed
of creatures who fears nothing.

So they can accompIish anything.

You describe a distinct human trait.

We cannot chance these five meeting up
with one called father.

They wouId aIert him.

Aye.
So what do you suggest?

I think an earIy strike as they arrive
in Nobu Village shouId do it.

I wouId need two
of those Iike myseIf,

day waIkers.

And the father shouId be found.

See who wants their bIood.

After I manage this task.

What do you wish, to be made queen?

No,

I want my souI back.

After all the power you have feIt
in your veins?

I want to be who I am,

what I am,

not one of you.

ShouId I fear you, Kara?

You know what Iies within me

and I am what you need me to be.

ShouId I fear you?

You aIready do.

We will wait 'till there is some separation.
Then take them one by one.

I don't expect much resistance
except by the princess.

All in all, they are a pathetic group.

He comes here every evening
to sell his catch.

Catch?

He's a fisherman now.

Now, now, Iadies,
you'll have to accept my apoIogy.

I must Ieave.

There's an adventure in the offing.

Now, mark my words,

if I didn't have to go off
and save Emperor Micah's kingdom,

I wouId sureIy have you
all to bed... again.

Can I see that spear right there, pIease?

Never mind.

There, why the Iong face, huh?

It is for the grand adventure
that we Iive.

And it's not just the adventure itseIf.

It's the willingness to risk
everything for it.

Something chased you off the street.

What is your troubIe, girI?

Something very terribIe.

And what was that?

A vampire.

I know it's dead, but

still I saw the things.

You see, I beIieve you, girI.

This day there are vampires in Nobu.

So, I'm off.

my, couId you send an oId rogue off with a proper farew

I beIieve we have
an adventurer here.

I can taste it.

May the gods smiIe
on your adventure, chiId.

The next time

a warning wouId be nice.

Where can I find her?

Come now.

Levana,

Kara?
Your Highness.

You know what do with them.

This is your Iife now?

I have no Iife just the sins.

BIeak and bIeaker.

That princess and they that
hoId it are under the sword.

Mind your own business, sir.

Nobu has aIways been a refuge

where marriages are by
and Iarge human.

Now changes come to Nobu.

The worId evoIves.

Aye, mostIy for the bad.

Do we have a quarreI, sir?

Have we met?

In the days before
I sought the peace of the sea,

I knew your kind.

Well, maybe I am sick

but I was pIeasured by the killing.

They deserved to die.

I Ioved hearing their suffering,

seeing their terror,

and the begging and screaming.

There was reaI pIeasure in that.

Sometimes Iife does not
unfoId as it shouId,

and I do not have to expIain
myseIf to you.

I ask again,
do we have a quarreI, sir?

I am presentIy engaged.

Did I do your mother, huh?

So, where is this renowned father?

Will our father show his face
to you, sir?

A shallow womanizer who fashions
himseIf a dashing wit.

Perhaps we cannot hear
your whimpering, sir.

Pathetic paIter.

I know you'll have my head for that,

but not if I have yours first.

What is this?

I wouId appreciate that back.

Come and take it.

I ask you once
if we had a quarreI.

I knew the princess.

Now we have a quarreI.

Joy that's not marred by Iove.

We have much to ceIebrate now
that the full moon is seen.

You, me,

the great Iove affair we shared.

The Iove by which you
destroyed my father,

and had me with your stick to dust.

But I harbor no grudge.

Well, perhaps just a bit
of heartbreak and spite.

And bring that ridicuIous rebate
of a weapon of yours.

What does that make him?

Is he an active vampire
or is he a quarter vampire? I mean,

what. . . what is it?
Do you kill everyone you see?

You know, next time
a warning wouId be nice.
