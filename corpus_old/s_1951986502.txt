SWING VOTE

<i>After a hotly contested race,</i>
<i>Americans go to the polls today...</i>

<i>in what promises to be</i>
<i>a very close election.</i>

<i>The Republican Andrew Boone,</i>
<i>hoping to hold on to the Oval Office...</i>

<i>by edging out...</i>

<i>the Democratic challenger</i>
<i>Donald Greenleaf.</i>

Bud... Bud.

Bud!

I'll call...
I'll call him back.

If we had a phone, you could.
Come on!

Goddamnit! It's cold.

We're gonna be late again.
You need a shower.

Can't believe
you slept in your clothes!

Leave me any hot water?

I don't know.
Water heater fix itself?

Christ, Molly! Why don't you
just take the day off, okay?

I'll write you a note.

Now!
I'm not going to tell you again!

Get up!

<i>Bud!</i>

Alright, I'm coming!

What?
Egg salad.

Again?

You like egg salad.

Well, not every damn day I don't.
You could mix it up a little.

We're on a budget.

You wanna eat better?
Drink less beer.

Fine.
Fine.

And don't forget today.
What's... what's today?

Election day, dummy!

I'm supposed to do a report
on you voting, remember?

I already told you before
I'm not even registered.

I registered for you
in the mail.

That's great,
I could get jury duty now.

It's your civic responsibility.
It's my civic, my what?

It's your civic responsibility.

My civic responsibility?
Where you learning this crap?

Mrs. Abernathy.

Well, stay away from her.

She's my teacher.

Sign this.

What is it?

A questionnaire. I'm supposed
to ask you about your politics.

Well, go ahead.

I already filled it in.

I wanted you to sound smart.

Give me
the first question anyway.

What's your political affiliation?

Alright,
I'm a conscious objector.

It's not a war, Bud. It's an election.
And you are an independent.

Independent? Why in the hell
would I be an independent?

Because the two party system...

has neglected the needs
of the working poor.

Let me tell you something, baby...
Here we go again.

The voting doesn't count
for a goddamn thing.

Just a way to make you feel
like you're in control of something.

It doesn't matter who you vote for,
we can't afford insurance and...

if you get sick, I'm gonna have
to start selling my blood again.

Mrs. Abernathy said every vote counts.
It's a social contract.

It's a social contract.
This Mrs. Abernathy is full of shit.

Meet me at the polling place
after work.

Fine.

You forgetting something?

Bud, screw this up
and I'm leaving you.

Do good!

Where...

Where the hell is Dewey?

He got laid off.

Bullshit! He got insourced.

Insourced?

Insourced. Instead of exporting
our jobs to Mexico...

they're importing Mexicans
to take our jobs.

You're paranoid,
you know that?

<i>Attention! The opening</i>
<i>this morning is officially cancelled.</i>

I can't even read
the damn signs no more!

Our days are numbered, fellas.
You mark my words!

These hombres work twice
as hard for half the money.

I just figure they need this job
twice as bad as us!

Whose side are you on?

I don't take sides, Lowell.
Just stating the obvious.

Next thing, they'll be taking
away our right to vote.

You voting, Bud?

It's a social contract,
isn't it?

Who are you voting for?

Shit if I know!

I think I picked up a couple shades.
Looks like an eight.

What do you think, Marty?

I don't like
the margin in Florida.

Bus some young Republicans down
to the polling stations in Palm Beach.

Make sure they're tall,
they're blonde and they're men.

Because old Jews see a pack
of angry young white males...

and they're gonna think twice
about getting out of their car!

Kennedy was a nine.
And he put a man on the moon.

That's what we need.
Something to shoot for.

A defining moment.
Like... I don't know.

Cure for cancer.

Ohio run the gay marriage
ad every twenty minutes.

Let's see if we can't get those God
fearing bastards off the fence.

We take a bunch of scientists,
put them in the desert somewhere.

Like the Manhattan project. Are you
listening to me? I'm serious about this.

I think that cancer is going to be
a tough nut to crack in one term, sir.

So, we make it a ten year plan.

Lincoln got to see the end of slavery?
No.

Did Kennedy get to see the moon shot?
Nope.

No! But they got the credit!
It's the idea that counts.

The guy that sets the goal
gets in the history books!

Hope and positivity! Marty,
the American people want a bright...

shining smile to represent
the promise of this country.

Take old Georgie there.

Boy, he was off the charts.

They wanted to make him King.

Son of a gun!

Thank you,
thank you for coming.

Galena and I would like
to thank America...

for this glorious opportunity.

I have met people of every race,
color and creed...

during this long campaign.

I pledge to you that my White House
will be a rainbow house.

It'll be open to people
of all colors and creeds.

Now, please, go and vote.
We need your support.

That was great.
I'm gonna go do press.

Great.

Greenleaf! Greenleaf!

Gallup has you down by a point.

CNN, USA Today, has us up by two.
News has us down by sixty.

What message are you trying
to get out to the undecideds today?

The same message we put out yesterday,
last week and last year...

when we started this campaign
and that's why we're going to win.

Because we have the answers.
Not platitudes and jingoistic rhetoric.

This is the truth
train operation real deal.

In recent days, the president
has aired ads claiming Greenleaf...

has vacationed
at a nudist colony.

Come on, now, that's a tired
accusation. It's pure fiction.

Then, how do you answer for the photos?
Right wing blogo-smear, that's how.

I could stand here and perpetuate
the rumor that as a young man...

the president had a gambling addiction,
but I'm got going to sink to their level.

Despite eye witness
accounts and documentation.

They sling mud,
we sling ideas.

Still, if Greenleaf loses,
you'll be 0 for 7 on the national scene.

Thank you, Betty. Sorry, folks,
that's all I have time for.

Leeches!

Why it's important to vote.

Many brave soldiers
sacrificed themselves.

A right we take for granted.

For the people.
By the people.

We the people!

I can't read my writing.

All the world's great civilizations
have followed the same path.

From bondage, to liberty,
from liberty to abundance...

from abundance to complacency.
From complacency to apathy...

from apathy back to bondage.

If we're to be the exception to history,
then we must break the cycle.

For those who do not remember
the past are condemned to repeat it.

Very good, everybody.
Very good.

Hold this.

Okay, remember, no running
till you get out to the playground.

Your last one was great.
I'd like to use it on the news.

Molly?
Yes.

Molly, come here.

This is Ms. Madison.
She's the reporter from the news.

Hi, Molly.
Hi.

How you doing?
Good.

Your essay was very thoughtful.

Thanks.

Ms. Madison is going
to show your essay tonight.

Isn't that exciting?
Yes, madam.

Tell me something. What do you
want to be when you grow up?

I go back and forth. Either
a veterinarian or chairman of the Fed.

Where's Bud?

Went to take a leak half an hour ago.
I heard his name over the loudspeaker.

What'd you have for lunch?

Egg salad. You?
Hard boiled.

Hey, Bud.

Just giving you a heads up.

Management wants us
to cut another ten percent.

Well,
you are management, Carl.

Look, you haven't punched
in on time in six months.

So, I'm five minutes late every once
in a while. What is the big whoop?

You took thirty-one
sick days this year, Bud.

Well, I gotta kid, Carl.
She brings it home from school.

<i>Shit! Goddamnit!</i>

Well, hell, Carl!

You could have showed me
your footage when you walked in.

I know we went to school together, Bud.
I've always liked you.

You gotta give me one good
reason why I should keep you.

Why I can keep you.

All hellsabelle!

Sorry you lost your job.

That's alright, Henry. Just...

As soon as take your money,
I'm going from fired to retired.

Hey, Bud!
Yes?

Molly is on TV!

<i>Apathy back to bondage.</i>
Geez!

<i>If we are to be the exception to history,</i>
<i>then we must break the cycle.</i>

Curly, what time you got?
Nine past seven.

God!

God, man! Shit!

Goddamnit!

PLEASE,
INSERT YOUR BALLOT

ERROR CODE - RESTART

I hurt the top of my head.

Come on, lay down.

I'm so sorry, baby.

I want to live with Mom.

Me too.

<i>New Mexico</i>
<i>is a classic swing state.</i>

<i>Mrs. Madison?</i>
Speaking.

<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>from the New Mexico election board.</i>

The what?
<i>The New Mexico election board.</i>

<i>Madam, did you cast your vote</i>
<i>at a Texico polling station last night?</i>

I voted in the morning.

<i>In the morning. Alright.</i>

Is there something the matter?

<i>No, no, sorry to bother you.</i>

<i>It is amazing. With every state</i>
<i>but New Mexico reporting...</i>

<i>we're now in a dead heat</i>
<i>for the American presidency.</i>

<i>Each candidate with virtually</i>
<i>the same amount of electoral votes.</i>

<i>270, the magic number to win.</i>
<i>This is a real photo finish!</i>

<i>And it goes to whoever wins</i>
<i>the popular vote in the state.</i>

<i>All five electoral college votes</i>
<i>then swing to that party.</i>

<i>Well, they don't call it the land</i>
<i>of enchantment for nothing.</i>

<i>Whoever takes New Mexico,</i>
<i>takes the White House.</i>

<i>It's déjà vu again. 2000 presidential</i>
<i>election came down to Dade County.</i>

<i>400 votes in the state of Florida,</i>
<i>out of a total of 105 million cast.</i>

<i>If this is a certified tie, neither the</i>
<i>candidate would receive the majority.</i>

<i>Do we even have a president</i>
<i>to deal with this?</i>

<i>Pursuant to the 12th amendment, the</i>
<i>House of Representatives would decide.</i>

<i>That hasn't happened since...</i>

<i>John Quincy Adams defeated</i>
<i>Andrew Jackson back in 1824.</i>

<i>We're talking rare.</i>

<i>No, this isn't a great civics lesson</i>
<i>to the people of this country?</i>

<i>If anyone in New Mexico didn't vote,</i>
<i>he be kicking themselves right now.</i>

<i>The latest reports coming in,</i>
<i>Curry County still too close to call.</i>

<i>This election is down to a single</i>
<i>county. Is this even possible?</i>

Listen, John, there's only 653
registered voters in Texico.

<i>And they've already</i>
<i>recounted those votes.</i>

I know. With that information
and a dollar, I could buy a chalupa!

Everyone I know who voted
has been personally called.

So what?

So, the election. The fact
that it's down to Curry County...

it has something
to do with Texico.

Oh my God. Call you back!

Bud!

Come on!

God, my head!

What? What time is it?

There's some people
here to see you.

Some people?

They look official.

Child services?
That's what I'm thinking.

Okay.
Here we go.

Mr. Johnson, we would have called first,
but you don't have a telephone.

No, no, no, we got a phone.

It's just not connected right now.
But I'm on it, you know.

I'm not gonna say it's been easy
since the wife left, but...

we're getting on fine.
Sure are.

And I'm gonna pay these off, I swear.
Just as soon as I find a new job.

A new job?
Yes.

I used to be in this Willy Nelson
tribute band. I was thinking about...

getting the guys back together again,
soon as our bass player gets paroled.

And the drinking, I know it,
I know it looks bad.

And licking that sucker
is at the top of my list.

Please don't take away from me.

I'll do anything you say,
I swear.

She's just my only good thing.

Mr. Johnson,
we're not from Social Services.

No?

We're from the State
Election Bureau.

Fuck! Thank you, Jesus!

I'm Secretary of State Brower.
And this is Attorney General Wyatt.

Mr. Johnson,
did you cast your vote last night?

Last night, did you vote?

That's right,
it's my civic duty, isn't it?

Indeed it is.

Mr. Johnson,
is this your signature?

I guess.

You guess it's your signature?

No, no. That's right.
That's my signature.

Did you retain your stub?

What stub?

The perforated stub
on top of your ballot.

Where's that perforated stub
that I gave you for your school project?

I've got it.

It's him.

Yeah, it's him. What do you mean,
"him?" Me, him?

Sir, your vote didn't count.

Mr. Johnson,
it's our duty to inform you...

that you are entitled to recast
your ballot in a timely manner.

What if I don't want to?

Bud!

Alright then, how about if I, how
about if I just whisper it to you then?

Right here we'd get it over with,
right now and you can listen too!

No, sir, there are strict rules
and legal procedures.

Legal shit. Shit, fellas,
I can't afford a lawyer.

You're not in trouble.
You don't need a lawyer.

However,
I will have to administer an oath.

An oath?

An oath. Please,
place your hand on the Bible.

Do you, Earnest Johnson...

swear to recast your ballot
in the spirit of the law?

Yeah, yes, sure. Okay.

So noted.

A petition will be filed on your behalf
and a date will be set for your revote.

Does this put me
on some sort of fast track list?

You know, for like jury duty?

Considering the gravity of this
situation, keep all of this a secret.

Have a good night.

<i>Sorry.</i>

You should be! I could get into
all kinds of trouble because of you!

Gosh, Molly!

Why can't you
learn just to let things be?

I told you this was important to me,
but you never listen!

<i>Another astonishing development:</i>
<i>New Mexico Elections Bureau is reporting...</i>

<i>a single irregular ballot is holding</i>
<i>up a final decision in the state.</i>

<i>As I said, a single ballot.</i>
<i>That's one vote, folks!</i>

<i>This really couldn't get any stranger,</i>
<i>MSNBC has learned that the voter...</i>

<i>has been identified and has</i>
<i>agreed to recast the ballot.</i>

<i>One voter will decide the fate</i>
<i>of the state's five electoral votes.</i>

<i>On this bizarre day, no one</i>
<i>will soon forget, one American citizen...</i>

<i>will effectively choose the next</i>
<i>President of the United States.</i>

Apparently the electronic
voting machine malfunctioned.

The ballot was scanned, but the machine
died before the vote was counted.

It's an anomaly.

No shit, Larry! What polling
station was the machine in?

Texico, New Mexico, sir.

Is that a place?

Where the hell is Texico?

New Mexico, sir, Curry County.

New Mexico election law dictates
if a voter's right is violated...

The voter shall be-entitled
to recast the ballot. I know.

Alright, kids,
we're going to war.

A map!
Somebody get me a map!

There's one schmuck standing between us
and the White House. Find out who it is.

We can't do that legally.

Just find him.

We were supposed
to my cytoplasm out of Jell-O today.

What kinda kid would rather
sit in a crummy classroom...

than be out here?

What kind of father goes fishing
when he should be looking for a new job?

The kind who would just like...

to spend a little more time
with his daughter.

That's who.

Fine.
Fine.

Anyway, I've been thinking.

How refreshing!

Jesus! You gotta quit being
such a smart ass all the time?

And you've got to stop using Jesus
as a cuss word all the time!

He's a billion people's Savior.

Alright, fine, okay?
I get it.

Fine.
Fine.

I wish...
your mom could be here...

to talk to you about
everything that's going on.

I really do.

No, she... no, she can't.

She's just, she can't, baby.

Bud.

Next Tuesday, is bring
your father to school day.

So?
I want you to come.

It's not gonna embarrass
you that I don't have a job?

I don't care.

I want you to come anyway.

Think you can remember?
Of course.

How?

Well...

I'll write it on my forehead.

Can I go to school, now?

Yes. Just one more cast.

Why don't you go
start the truck.

Try to get a two shot, alright?
Okay, come on!

Earnest Johnson!

Yes?
Kate Madison.

Hi, there.
Hi.

Shit! You're the lady
from the news.

I am, and I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

You know, you're much prettier
than you are on the TV.

Thanks. I would...

Don't get me wrong,
you're pretty on the TV too.

Just, we got an old set
that kinda "squirshes" you.

Squishes everybody.

I believe, Mr. Johnson.
I believe...

You can call me Bud.

Bud. I was hoping you
could tell me why those men...

flew from Santa Fe,
to see you in the middle of the night.

Well, actually, I kinda promised
to keep that a secret.

You mean,
you're going to recast your vote.

Well, shit, I guess that I guess
it ain't that much of a secret then.

Now, listen, Bud,
you need to watch your language.

We're taping this for TV, okay?
The language?

Goddamnit, yes of course!

The question now is, who you voted for
and are you going to vote the same way?

Remind me again who's running?

What you're saying is,
you're keeping an open mind?

Yeah, that's...

That's the kinda guy I am.

You gotta be kidding me!

This is OJ big. Bigger!

I gotta call network!

John,
let me break the story.

I thought I was gonna die
in this shithole.

You said that when the time was right,
you'd give me a chance. That's the time!

We'll be back to a real market.

The city! With elevators and Chinese
restaurants and crime and traffic.

I got the tape
of Mrs. Zachary's prize winning sow.

Screw Mrs. Zachary.
And screw the sow!

You promised me.

Get network on the phone.
Don't screw it up.

You won't regret it!
Better not! Darlene!

So... is your dad coming
to talk to our class?

I don't know. Doesn't really leave
the house much since my mom left.

Mine left too.

She's pursuing
a singing career in Albuquerque.

I'm going to move there
when she becomes a big star.

And she's gonna take me
on tour and everything.

She'll probably do
a concert in Austin.

I could get you free tickets.

Maybe.
Guess I could borrow my dad's car.

I'll wait till he gets drunk.
Sometimes he passes out.

Do you think
I could try your skateboard?

Okay.

I'm the king of Curry County, John,
and I've been 15 years at this desk.

I feel for you, Ted.
Don't make me call security.

Holy crap!

You, desk! Sit!

People,
we go live in 30 seconds!

From this point on,
the news counts!

So excited,
I got my accent back. My god!

And cue graphics!

And cue music!

And cue!

Good evening. This is Madison, coming
to you from Curry County, New Mexico.

Over the last 24 hours,
the American political process...

<i>has ground to a virtual standstill</i>
<i>as the world watches...</i>

<i>waiting for the outcome of an election.</i>
<i>Today, I uncovered the identity...</i>

<i>of the person the entire</i>
<i>world has been looking for.</i>

<i>The one swing voter</i>
<i>who will decide the election.</i>

<i>Those of you hoping to hear that</i>
<i>decision will be sorely disappointed.</i>

<i>Because you are about to meet</i>
<i>a registered independent...</i>

<i>who claims to be</i>
<i>keeping an open mind.</i>

<i>Imagine,</i>
<i>on this man's shoulders...</i>

<i>stands the future</i>
<i>of the free world.</i>

Just the kind of guy I am.

Let it never again be said,
that a single vote counts for nothing.

Bud!

Bud!

What?

There's some people outside.

Geez, you gotta stop
waking me up like this, okay?

You're gonna kill me.

There are some people outside!

People?

God!

No, not there! Out front!

Oh, God... What now?

Dad, hurry up!
Yeah, I'm going, honey.

There's a lot of people
out there.

Okay, honey, let's see
what the fuss is all about.

<i>Is that him?</i>

Bud!

Mr. Johnson,
any decisions yet?

Holy shit!
What do they want?

I don't know.

Go turn the TV on, baby.

<i>We are in the midst</i>
<i>of a historic moment.</i>

<i>The swing voter</i>
<i>has finally been identified.</i>

<i>We go live now to a trailer</i>
<i>in Texico, New Mexico.</i>

<i>Earnest Johnson made</i>
<i>an appearance just moments ago.</i>

<i>Apparently, overwhelmed</i>
<i>by the media presence.</i>

<i>And Mr. Landry, exactly how long</i>
<i>have you known Earnest Johnson?</i>

<i>Earnest Johnson?</i>
<i>Hey, Earnest!</i>

<i>You mean Bud?</i>
<i>We all grew up together.</i>

<i>How do you think he's</i>
<i>shouldering the responsibility...</i>

<i>of picking the next President</i>
<i>of the United States?</i>

<i>Well, I'm sure that...</i>

<i>Earnest is...</i>
<i>crapping his pants.</i>

<i>He's a good guy.</i>
<i>He likes to treat them good.</i>

<i>We used to light</i>
<i>the mesa back here on fire!</i>

It's all my fault, isn't it?

No! No, no, no, baby, no.

None of this would have happened
if I hadn't let you down.

What are we gonna do?

Well...

I'm gonna back these people up.

Holy shit!

There's so many!

Ok, I'm just gonna go out there,
right? I'm gonna...

I'm gonna walk out there and tell
those people it wasn't me who voted.

No, you can't!

Why not?

You swore to that judge,
on a Bible and everything.

What? That was the middle
of the night. That can't count!

You were under oath, Bud.
Voter fraud is a felony.

And one more felony
and they take me away from you.

You're right. Shit!
I am down to one!

What do we do?

We lie. We have to.

Okay, that's a good plan.
Just a little white lie is all this is.

Between us.
Just between us.

Who knows,
maybe this thing, all these...

Maybe all these people,
they just go away.

Stop! Stop!

What the hell is this?

The biggest space we could find.

How we gonna do this?
Build a campaign around one man?

I don't know how to do this.
You're gonna leave it to me.

We're gonna win him, Don!
We're gonna win this guy.

We got the issues on our side!

There you go!
He's gonna love me!

What's not to love?

We're in trouble. I need you to dig up
everything you can on Earnest Johnson.

Talk to his family, his friends.

I want to know what he reads,
what television show he watches.

His hobbies, his favorite foods,
his hopes, his dreams, everything.

All we have to do is win
over one American mind!

You know, I was just thinking,
Marty.

I'd like to get to know
this Bud Johnson. Personally.

Okay. Good.

Maybe take him out
for some ice cream.

Ice cream?

What grown man
doesn't like ice cream?

No higher education,
not much lower education.

Divorced single father,
recently laid off.

What's our first step?

Put you in a room together. See if you
persuade him to come over to our side.

I like it. Him and me in a room. Yes,
talking ideas, seeing what comes up.

Great plan.
I'll get you some talking points.

I'm good off the cuff already.

Of course! We're just gonna get
an itty bitty think tank together.

We'll run the data, see what you two
could possibly have in common.

Your petition has been processed.

And in accordance with New Mexico state
law, Chapter 1, Article 13, Section 11.

Could you do us a favor and back
these news people up a little bit?

We could barely
sleep last night.

said voter Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized...

to recast his vote 10 days
from today along official.

And there's a fat guy there,
he keeps leaning on my truck...

fixing his hair
in my side mirror.

Said voter, Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized to recast his vote...

10 days from today. Along official
documentary notification...

to both state,
federal regulatory authorities.

Bud, life's gonna be
a little different from now on.

You'll need security
around the clock.

For what?

You're a household name.

Every political nut job in the country
is gonna make their way down here.

In 10 days, you gonna make the most
important decision in the free world.

And it is our job to make sure
this thing comes off fair and square.

So, if there's anything
that you think we need to know...

Like what?

Something
we may find out later.

Better now, than later.

No, sir,
there's nothing to know.

Molly! Molly! Molly!

I don't believe it. She's his daughter!
Who's his daughter?

The Chairman of the Fed,
the girl that won the essay contest.

Remember, I ran the story on her,
election day?

This is perfect! The network wants
to do an interview with her daddy.

I'm not going
to use this little girl!

I've told you this before.
I have integrity, like Paula Zahn.

I met Paula Zahn.

Paula Zahn eats
where my friend is a waiter, alright?

I don't want to hurt
your feelings, you're no Paula Zahn.

No Paula Zahn?

I booked this story.
It was me.

Yes, that's why everybody here
is trying to rip it out from under you.

You want a desk in New York,
you want a desk in Los Angeles?

Forget everything you learned
in journalism school.

This isn't new anymore. This isn't life.
This is bigger. This is television!

<i>The Johnsons have been virtually</i>
<i>besieged inside their trailer.</i>

<i>but we're lucky to be joined</i>
<i>by their pizza delivery man.</i>

<i>How would you characterize</i>
<i>Earnest Johnson's state of mind?</i>

<i>Mostly I'd say, he was hungry.</i>

<i>He was hungry.</i>

<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

I ain't tipping him anymore.

I ought to trim
Mrs. Hardy's elm.

Looks like it's moving in our roof.
What do you think?

Hard to tell.
What do you think?

Definitely.

<i>Since has become the most Googled</i>
<i>town in the world...</i>

<i>narrowly edging out in Jihad.</i>

Holy crap!

You Bud?
Yeah!

You're Richard Petty.

You got it, man.

Hold on. Honey!
It's the king!

I got a friend down the road I want
you to meet. You wanna go for a ride?

Yes!
could my daughter come?

In that case, maybe you'd better
drive. Precious cargo and all!

Just a minute, Mr. Petty.
Hey, Chubby!

Just because it ain't rolling, don't
make it furniture! Back out of here!

Come on, baby! We gotta go!

You're Richard Petty!

Molly! Get a picture, honey.

If you told me two days ago
that I'd be driving your Dodge...

Did you get it?
Yes.

Get one more. Get it with my chin
out a little bit. Like that.

Like a hero.

I told you, you crazy!

You ain't seen nothing yet.

Bud!

This is the President's plane.

Hello, you be Molly. I'm Mr. Fox,
I work with the President.

Hi.
Hi. Bud, Martin Fox.

Hello.
How are you? Come in.

Take your hat off please.
Your hat.

So, this is the Johnson family.

Welcome to Air Force One.
Hi, Molly.

Thanks for having us, sir.
It's a pleasure.

Mr. President.
Huh?

Call him Mr. President.

It's an honor, Mr. President.

It's an honor to meet you, Bud.
May I call you Bud?

Yes, Mr. President.

Come on in, come on.

God, this...

This place
is it's really something!

It's my little home in the sky.

It's kinda,
like a trailer with wings.

Fine analogy, Bud.

Molly, I saw your speech
on TV the other night.

Very impressive!

Say thank you, baby.
Thank you, Mr. President.

You must be a very proud father.
Yes, sir.

God, I'm sorry.
Mr. President.

You can see why she's definitely
the brains of our operation.

I know what you mean.
we all need a Molly.

Marty here, is my Molly.

That's right. Molly,
I bet a smart kid like you...

would love to see the war room.

No, thanks.

Why don't we have a peek and then your
dad and the President can have a talk.

Go on, Honey.
Daddy has to talk to the President.

She's a firecracker!

Yes, sir, she's the whole deal!

I wouldn't mind seeing
the war room, Mr. President.

I'll show it to you later.
And please, call me Andy.

Andy?
Yeah.

Are you sure,
that-that other guy...

I know, things can get
a little formal around here.

Commander in Chief, running
the country and all that. Please.

I am just an ordinary man,
like you...

The kinda guy you can sit down
and have a beer with.

Would you like a beer, Bud?

A beer?

No shit?

No shit.

Well, then...

Yes. Hell, yeah, Andy.
Okay!

David, would you get us
a couple of beers, please?

Thank you very much.
So...

you're gonna have some
story to tell your friends.

I read about you in the paper.
They say you've never lost an election.

That's right. You can learn
a lot from reading the newspaper.

They also said that you don't
believe in anything anymore.

Even if it meant
selling your mother's soul.

No, see, no, see that's libelous,
Because my mother is a wonderful...

wonderful, wonderful woman.

If you met my mother,
you'd understand.

You a football fan, Bud?

Well, I'm an American, aren't I?

I played a little in high school.

Did you now? What position?

I was quarterback.

I always thought football was
a strategic game. A lot like diplomacy.

You got your offense, your defense,
the President is like your quarterback...

and the American voters...

Well... they're like the coach.

Never thought of it that way.

Now the coach's job
is to make sure...

that the right man has
the football at the critical time.

I know exactly what you mean,
Andy.

Do you?

Maybe not.

Bring in the football, please.

Bud.

You wanna hold the football?

There's a football in there?

That case holds
the launch codes...

to America's nuclear arsenal.

That's what
this election's all about.

launch codes like...
missiles and shit?

I want you to pretend
that America is a team...

and you're the coach.
Okay.

Let's say it's the 4th quarter. We've
got possession, but we're down by five.

North Korea has us pinned
in our own fifteenth line...

with one second on the dooms day clock.
What are you doing to do?

Okay, you go long. The only thing
standing between victory and defeat...

is a successful Hail Mary.
One play.

Who are you
gonna give the ball to, Bud?

Do you pin your hopes on some
liberal second string quarterback...

who hasn't had five minutes
in the big show? Of course you don't.

You do the smart thing.

The only thing. You go
with your strongest arm, the man...

who's carried you through the season,
who's never let you down.

Bud, America's counting on you.

Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna let them down.

But, here.

Wouldn't want to drop
the old football.

Blow up France or something.

You couldn't.

There's a whole bunch of secret
codes and these special little keys.

Here's to you!

Look at all... Look at all
this stuff they give us, Molly.

They give us the same shampoo
that the President uses.

Great.

So, what did you guys talk about?

Stuff.
What stuff?

You know...

grown up stuff.

Like?

Like...

Bud!

What stuff?

Like grown up stuff.
You know, coaching. Football.

Geothermal nuclear war.

Andy's, a great... great guy.

He's not Andy.
He's the President of the United States.

And he just wants your vote.

And gee, guess what?
He's gonna get it.

It's not even yours to give!

You're gonna...

ruin everything.

Andy, the President,
invited me to watch the game...

with him on Monday night.
That's a bribe!

That's not a bribe.

Is too.
It is not.

Is too.
It is not.

Is too!
Is not! What it is, "too"?

What the hell do you know?
More than you.

You do not.
Do too.

You do not.
Do too.

Fine.
Fine.

Did you smell
all the leather on that plane?

<i>If I made you feel second best</i>

<i>I'm sorry I was blind</i>

No, baby, leave it, leave it.
That's Willie.

<i>You were always on my mind</i>

<i>Hi, I'm Willie Nelson.</i>

<i>And when I'm not performing,</i>
<i>I'm usually getting involved.</i>

<i>Hey, Bud, if you're out there</i>
<i>and you're watching...</i>

He's talking to us!

<i>There's a special dinner,</i>
<i>especially for you in your honor...</i>

<i>hosted by my good friend and</i>
<i>Presidential candidate Donald Greenleaf.</i>

<i>I'll see you here tonight.</i>
I'll do it, Willie!

This is really getting weird.

Democrat or a Republican?

I'm Art Crumb,
Donald Greenleaf's campaign manager.

Nice to meet you.
Same here.

You must be Molly. Quite an essay.
You have a future in politics one day.

You might too. One day.

Shall we go in?

Not too hard to be nice,
come on.

Party. Party!

Right this way...
make yourselves at home.
