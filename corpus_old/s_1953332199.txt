Fucking idiot.
First finish your job...

...finish your job, then go fuck,
do whatever you want.

Go fuck yourself idiot.

What am I going to teIl him?
How wilI l explain this?

What am l going to say to him?

My life has always been like this.

I've always gone the wrong way.

Just like a bad Turkish fiIm.

But l'm waiting.

The one up there wilI open
the road for me some day.

It can't continue like this.

Why don't we start from the beginning?

Where were you born?

l was born in Sivas.

ln the vilIage of lnceyoI.

lf you don't count the ones that died before me,
I was the 9th kid.

The youngest. Bottom of the pot.

Things were aIways busy at home.
My dad would beat us Iike it was his job.

He didn't make money from the fields that year?.
Come here Metin.

His soccerteam did badly?

My mom had another girl?
He would beat the shit out of us.

Of course we hated him.
Everyday a beating...

One day I had enough.

l stuck a knife in his back.

Son, what did you do?

You know what they say...

Beat a dog that much,
he'lI turn back and bite his owner.

What did you do?
My god what did you do?

l was 15. How should l have known?

Whatever...

ObviousIy I couIdn't stay in the
viIlage after this incident.

I got my mother's bIessing...

Jumped on the bus...

To the one safe place l could go.

IstanbuI's a strange Iand.

It seems it's the pIace
where everyone ends up.

It's purgatory.
It's helI. It's heaven.

lt's one of a kind.

It's been my fate.

lf I hadn't come here for a reason like this,
it may have been different.

It's a tough city.

No money, no power.
You can't do it. They'lI finish you.

I wasn't smart back then.
My head was fuIl of snot.

There was no one waiting
back home for me.

I did anything l had to.
a new job everyday.

l had nothing to lose.
Worse case l'd go in for 3-5 years.

That's exactIy what happened.

In-out. In-out.

Veysel, send me a pack of cigarettes.

15 years in totaI.

I was getting older.
Yesterday's kids were now bosses.

l had to stop. I got a reaI job.

I'm in a hurry
l can't pick you up. I said no.

I've been working for
a guy named ahmet Abi.

A deIivery service of sorts.
To homes, businesses...

Where have you been?
The girls are waiting.

I'm not delivering a pizza.
Don't caIl so Iate next time.

lf I was smarter l could've
had some money saved up.

But l've been spending everything l get.

l'Il save money on the bigger jobs.

ahmet Abi suggested l wouId
get big jobs soon. We'lI see.

From the looks of it, today shouId
have been a good day.

Ahmet abi had calIed me in.
That's a big deal.

l've been with him for a while now.
and I've never messed up.

He must have pIans for me.

lt's that sort of a day.

What's this?

Shit.

What's going on?

Nothing. Go back to sleep.

What's this?

What?

What is this?

Go back to sIeep.

Why is it wet?

Why is it wet?

Did you pee?

What are taIking about? You crazy?

You're disgusting.

ldiot.

Don't touch me with those hands.
There's pee alI overthem.

lt's humid in--
Don't touch me.

Grow up first. asshoIe.

Why do aIl the losers find me?

Where are you going?

TV a 74 year oId man has
died as a resuIt of bee stings...

... in the town of GoIcuk in KocaeIi.

This is the second such
incident in the past week.

Experts fearthe bees are
migratory kilIer bees from africa.

Those stung by bees are urged...

When's Ahmet abi going to caIl me in?
My ass is flattened from sitting here.

You have to wait.

I'm waiting.

The number of people
reporting to hospitals rose to 9.

To get the latest,
we are going Iive to...

Do you have an aspirin?
My head's kilIing me from last night.

No.

Open a window orsomething.
It's disgusting in here.

lt feeIs like earthquake weather.

Stop taIking Iike an idiot.

So what exactIy do you do here?
What's your deal?

None of your business.

God...

Come on Metin.

FinalIy, brother.

Where have you been, IittIe brother?.

We can't find you when we need you.

I'm at your command, brother.
Ready for anything.

What did you do with your debt?

Did you pay it back?

Thanks to you, brother

It won't happen again, right?

HiImi is expecting this. At 3 o'cIock.

There won't be any probIems, right?

What?

Brother, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

...isn't this a job for a driver?.

Go Metin.

There won't be any problems, right?

Yildiz, it's me.

I'm coming to see you.
You're availabIe right?

What do you mean no?
l realIy need to see you.

Come on. l'm in bad shape.
I'm aImost there.

Hang on, l'm in a tunneI.

l'm there, open the door.

asshoIe...

Here you go.

Get rid of this.

Slow down.

Relax a little.

What happened?

You think you're the shit sometimes.

But then others treat you Iike shit.

lt's not fair.

That's what you're upset about?
Come on get up.

Shit.

l'm in troubIe.

Yildiz, where did you put my bag?

I don't know.
Somewhere in there.

What do you mean you don't know.
Where is it?

You must have put it overthere.

Don't make me crazy.

Look around.

Who knows where you tossed it.

Don't make me crazy.
Look for it.

WiIl you calm down?

Calm down? My bag is gone.

Where did it go in this little shithoIe?

I don't know.

I don't know?
That's the only thing you can say?

You have to know.
Find my bag.

Stop yeIling at me.

Where did you put it?

Look under the table?
ln case it got underthere by itseIf? Sure.

Shit.

Was the window open the whole time?

You motherfucker.

You couldn't even do this stupid job.
What good are you?

How am I going to explain this?

Shit on my head.

lt's an easy job.
Just deliverthe bag.

You think you're a king?
You didn't like the job?

You feel bad about it?
Fuck you.

KilI me right now.

l want just one thing to go
right in my life. One thing.

God, take my Iife right now.

Don't ring...don't ring.

207, 208, 209, 210...

211, 212, 213, 214...

215, 216, 217, 218...

219, 220.

It's 220 steps from
the break room to room 405.

So, 2 pIus 2 plus 0.

4-0, or 40.

40 symbolizes fate.

The Persians, ancient Egyptians,
Greek mythoIogy...

They aIl give 40 a special pIace.

I don't understand.

Do you know what numerology is?

Something like fortune teIling?

Fortune telIing?

Fortune telIing is a simpIe
game for stupid people.

NumeroIogy is scientific.

It's based on math and Iogic.

There's a numerological
system beneath everything.

Nothing happens by luck.

Numerology heIps soIve
this mysterious system.

Accepting that we are a part
of something bigger...

Gives meaning to our otherwise
meaningIess lives.

The universe gives us signs.
We just need to see them.

Ourfates are hidden in our numbers.

Our eyes and feelings can deceive us.
But numbers never Iie.

Your numbers are 2, 4 and 11.

And 40. But that
number is something special.

Whenever you come across this number,
you have to act fast.

40. Don't forget it.

I constantly searched forthe meaning
of life before I discovered numeroIogy.

l was a Buddhist for 9 months.

I tried Christianity for 17 months.

I even covered up for 3 months.

But the emptiness neverwent away.

My first year as a nurse,
l feIl in Iove with a doctor.

I know it's a cliche.
But our numbers were a good match.

His fate numberwas 2. Mine was 4.

There are no objections to your marriage.

You, daughter of Sait, Sevda Topal...

Do you take the son of Mehmet,
Ali Eren as your spouse?

Numbers had given
me aIl the right signs.

l do.

What happened afterthat?

What are you doing Sevda?

Who's that woman?

Do l know the whore you asshoIe?

Calm down, you're pregnant.

Do l know the whore?

Don't expIain it.

CaIm down. The whoIe
building wiIl be at our door.

l don't care.

What kind of man are you?

CaIm down, please.

I don't care about the baby.

Things never got on the right track.

Then, that idiot Iost his job.

He had slept with
everyone at the hospital.

He spent the little money
we had saved up.

Everything was Ieft on my shoulders.

Eat your dinner.

I must be going through a test.

l'm even doubting numbers now.

Numbers don't lie.

l want to believe that.

But l need a sign.

The poor guy.

a taxi hit him and Ieft him.

There's such heartIess people...

Nurse...

The patient in 316 needs a bandage.

OK. l'Il be right there.

What's wrong Sevda?

I'lI be right back.

l'm not very good at these sort of things.

l don't Iike to taIk much.

AlI right, let's start with your name.

My name is GodwiIl OgboIlu.

I was born in Wawa, in Nigeria.

I was an only child.

My parents had tried
to have a kid for years.

AlI the viIlagers blamed my mother.

She never toId them the truth.

My birth came as
a surprise to the viIlage.

It was decIared
a miracle by the priests...

an act of god.

That's why my mother calIed me GodwiIl.

..subject verb and how they affect each other.
"l" becomes the subject.

"Am" describes what is happening now.
Or "was" -what happened yesterday.

Or "wiIl" - what wiIl happen tomorrow.

The happiest moment in
my life was when I met Gina.

Gina was the daughter of a famous politician
who had just moved to our vilIage.

AlI the boys in school in Iove with her.

Let me see if you understand so far.
GodwiIl! GodwilI!!

GodwilI! Why aren't
you listening to me?

You think l'm here as just a preacher,
making noise here?

There are mothers out there crossing
rivers to bring their children in my cIass...

And you are here just sitting.
What is wrong with you?

Come here. Come here.

Everybody look at me and Iearn.

This is what we do to chiIdren
who don't listen as I'm teaching.

Precious education.

My motherwas the onIy person
who realIy cared for me...

Until Gina.

Are you okay?

Gina had opinions about things
l hadn't even heard of.

I wiIl show the world.

She wanted to be an important author...

Feminist author orsomething
Iike that l can't exactly remember

women have a place too.

Why should we be treated
Iike second class peopIe?

She had already started
writing herfirst book.

She talked Iike an adult
which impressed me.

So what do you want
to be when you grow up?

Maybe l'Il work at the factory.
My father Iikes it there.

My goaI is to travel around the worId.
I'm going to Ieave this pIace as soon as l can.

You need bigger
ambitions too, GodwilI.

Like aIl the rich kids in town,
Gina transferred to a private schooI.

And l started working
at the factory outside of town.

l passed the time thinking of her.
Every night I dream of marrying her.

after high school Gina left for
Paris to go to university.

l never got to telI her
what she meant to me.

So how did you end up in IstanbuI?

I wanted to beat my fears
and telI Gina l Iove her.

l stayed working at the
factory for many years...

And Iike aIl the others
l got on a boat to Europe.

Hamza Abi...

This wasn't the Paris
I had seen in movies.

l Iearned Iater that
l was in lstanbul.

For 4 years, it's been home.

Like aIl the other
unwanteds in lstanbul,

l Iive in a neighborhood
calIed Tarlabas.

It's in the center of town...

But most locals don't venture here.

Pickpockets...Kurdish gangs...
africans...drug addicts...

...transvestites...

...they alI end up here.

There are Iots of guys
in Tarlabas who heIp

bring people Iike me to
Europe for 10,000 Euro.

l work alI day and night.
I've already saved most of it.

It's just a matter of time now.

Everybody here thinks l'm crazy.

But I believe in miracles.

I know I wiIl see Gina again.

God wiIl not leave me haIf way.

Where have you been?
I'm sick of you.

You're Iate again.

How do they come on time?
Lazy asshole.

Do it again and see what happens. ldiot.

Sorry, boss.

Sorry? Get to work.

Morning.

l could not wake up.

You have to give up that job.
lt's no good for you.

PIease... I'm sorry to bother you.

lt's no bother.

They toId me l could
find other Africans here.

Are you new here?

I'm looking for a pIace to stay.

Just give me a moment.

You can sIeep in my room here.

I'lI stay with the guys.

Have you seen the woman
that was with me yesterday?

Have you seen her??

What's going on?
Was there an earthquake?

Is Mahmut here?

OK, don't worry, we'Il take care of that.

l'Il have it done by Tuesday.

Ok, kisses to you.

Did you get the money?

l found it.

Good for you.

Ten thousand Euros.

Monday, at five. Be at this address.

We'lI take you to Cesme,
then out of the country.

We'lI bring you to Greece.

From there,
ourfriends wiIl take over.

You'lI be drinking coffee
in Paris by Wednesday.

We won't wait though if you're Iate.

OK?

Brother...

You're telIing the truth, right?

Trust me, son.

l'Il get the doctor.

lt's a miracIe you're alive.

Someone's Iooking out for you.

Do you understand me?

The nurse wiIl get you painkilIers.

FeeI better.

There'lI be a lot of paperwork.
I don't want to hoId him long.

Let him feel a little better,
then let him go.

Where's my bag?

What?

Where's my bag?

Where is it?

I haven't seen it. l don't know.

Where are you going Metin?

Wait...

Why haven't you caIled Ahmet abi?

He's been worried sick.

Brother, pIease. Wait, Wait

OK, brother, just wait a minute.

Let's go see Ahmet abi so he can relax a bit.

My friend, let go of my arm.

Get in the car.

Fuck you.

Don't swear. Get in the car.

Fuck You.

Don't drag this on.

Motherfucker.

Don't swear.

I don't mean anything, brother.

Brother...

l swear on my mother,
l don't know where the money is.

Brother, l give you God's name.

Would l take your money? Am I fucking nuts?

Stop swearing.

Brother, I took the bag from you...

A friend of mine was in troubIe.
So l had to go see her.

l went to see how she was.

l Ieft the bag on the table.

She toId me about her probIems.

When l came back, the bag was gone.

I don't know if it feIl orwhat.

I swear on my mother, that's what happened.

Brother pIease.

l'Il give you another opportunity.

PIease brother.

24 hours.

Get my bag and bring it to me.

That's impossible, brother.
How can l find it in 24 hours?

l can't find it in 24 hours.

lf I find who took it I'm going to kiIl him.
I won't Ieave it to you.

l'Il twist Tarlabasi upside down.
I wiIl get you the money.

But it's 50,000 Euros.

Life is hard for us, Metin.

Brother, pIease. Please.

24 hours.

PIease.

Look at my face.

We have a deaI?

Yes

Bastard.

You can bandage him up.

FeeI better.

Are we done?

We're done.

Can we take this off?

lt must be a bad day.

ReaIly? How did you know?

You got 23 stitches.

23 is the most cursed of aIl numbers.

What the helI are you taIking about?

Do you come across it
in other places these days?

WouId I be Iaying here
like a Iamb if l had Iuck?

Don't calI it luck.

Everything we calI Iuck
has a logical expIanation.

WilI it scar?

lt's a deep cut.

Easy

What are you doing?

Give me my money back.

l don't want anything eIse

Don't come cIoser.

PIease.

Don't come cIoser.

Give me my money

Go away.

l'Il scream

Give me my money

Please

This is God's money.

Help

Help. HeIp me.

What's wrong, sister?.

This pervert is folIowing me.

Who?

The bIack man.

Come here.

It Iooks Iike a vagina.

Yeah...

I'lI take off the bandage and you can go at it.

Asshole.

Come on, women Iove that.
You know, scarred, bruised men.

Stop teasing me. l'm in deep shit.

I heard.

ahmet Abi caIled and asked about you.

What did you say?

What do you think?
l toId him I didn't know anything.

ls what he said true?

Suleyman, for God's sake...

l have enough to worry about right now.

Brother...

I wouldn't do this if l wasn't in troubIe...

Do you have any money?

How Much?

50,000 or so

Lira?

No, not Iira.

That wouId be easy.

Euro.

Euro? 50,000 Euros?

You're never going to change, Metin.

You came into the worId crooked,
you're going to leave it crooked.

How am I going to find
this money in one day?

If l could even find a part of it,
I couId take it to him...

And say, take this for now.

I may...

Be able to set you up with a job.

18, 20, 22, 24..

26, 28, 30...

32, 34, 36...

38, 40.

Pinar. Get up.

Come on.

I bought you that cake you Iike.

Come on, Pinar.

Let us go, GodwilI.

But it's not fair.

It doesn't matter.

She Iooked me in the eye and lied.

lf I were you...

I would forget about it and Ieave this city.

You know Murat?

Bastard, Murat.

He toId me about this pIace

Why is there so much money in a car park?

Are you sure there's no mistake?

No, Brother.

The owner is mafia.

They have a crappy
office in the back.

That's where they
run everything from.

I know them. They won't keep Iess then
10-15 thousand Euros in the safe.

No kidding?

See the guard...

He's the boss's nephew.

He knows the combination for the safe.
He's your guy.

What if he has a gun?

I don't think so.

Are you scared?

No, it's just...

Look at my face.
lf he does something...

There's nothing to it, brother.
Go in and get the money.

Go in and get the money?

Don't panic.

Fuck you. l'm not panicking.

Come on then.

Come on.

OK, wait.

You'lI be here, right?

Come on, son.

BismiIlah.

Thanks, brother.

Don't taIk.

Wait-

Shut up. Move.

Are you taking me the right way?
I'lI squeeze the trigger if you're Iying.

It's at the end of the haIlway.

Where's the safe?

What safe?

Don't play with me.
Where is the safe?

What are you looking for?.

I'm looking forthe safe, idiot.
Where is it?

My friend, l won't kilI you. I'lI cripple you.

l'Il break your arm and stick it

What do you mean?

Fuck you. Open the safe.

Brother, I'm seeing it forthe first time.

What do you mean?

This is the first time I've been in here.

Come on.

Aren't you the boss's nephew?

You're taIking about Mehmet.

He couldn't make it today. l'm fiIling in for him.

You fucked me up, brother.

Where are you watching the game, brother?

My brother in-Iaw's.

Isn't he a Galatasaray fan?

Fuck.

If we Iose, he won't shut up for a week.

Watch it with us at the coffee house.

Shit

My wife banned me

You're a Iight-man.

Don't stop.

Don't stop there.
