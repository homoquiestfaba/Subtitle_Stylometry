Do you have a reservation?
Welcome.

'Name: Joon-ha Seo'

Profession?

Profession.

Lawyer.

I'm tired, too. Let's help each other out, okay?

It's true. He's really a lawyer.

You assholes... Listen!

Is your living room, huh? Who are you kidding?

Oh, still hard at work...

The Gyu-sik Hwang case has been dropped.

-What was that all about?
-The bastard perjured himself.

Well, there's an endless list
of bastards we'd like to beat up.

But did you go to beat him up?
You look terrible.

Here's the case summary for CEO Choi
of the Taejin Group. Courthouse 514.

-Hey, did you eat yet?
-Yes.

This is the Ji-man Lee, biker case.
Courthouse 302.

And the settlement?

He's bringing it over today.

-lf we've got everything, shall we go?
-Sure.

Defendant, please stand.
Do you have anything to say?

I'm deeply remorseful for my crime.

Forgive me this once. I won't do
things like this again and work hard.

Sentencing will be in 3 weeks,
on Sept. 22nd at 2 PM. Next.

Case no. 3215.

Case no. 3215, defendant ll-man Choi,
not in custody.

Defendant ll-man Choi.

Where is your client?

Well...he's not here yet.

-What do you want to do?
-We'll postpone.

Next court date in three weeks.
Sept. 22nd, 3 PM. Next.

Case no. 1817.

Lawyer Seo.

I told you before, those sneakers...

It's not a big problem but
considering it's a courtroom...

Let's pay attention to our attire.

What time is it now? Didn't I tell you
to wear your school uniform?

Why are you hitting me? I'm not the one.

You're not?

You all look the same to me.
Can't tell one brat from another.

And the settlement?

Here.

But do I really have to wear this?

What are you good for?

You have to look decent for the judge
at least. Get changed and go in.

I've got damn egg on my face.

He should've had his secretary
call at least.

What the hell is this?
You can't even make sure the client shows up.

-Hey? Aren't you coming?
-I have one more case.

Another court-appointed one?

Last spring, you entered
a model airplane contest and won the bronze.

You also entered a writing contest
and your book review almost won.

But since it was an erotic novel,
you were disqualified.

-People felt bad, correct?
-Yes.

You didn't plan on stealing
the motorcycle.

You just wanted to ride it
and then return it, correct?

Yes.

You're very sorry about this
and can swear never to speed again, correct?

Now answer in a loud voice.

-Yes!
-Nothing further.

This is a settlement the victim
agreed upon on Aug. 31st.

Defendant, please stand.

Do you have anything to say?

First, I'm very sorry to have
caused trouble in this quiet society.

I'll live quietly from now on.

Sentencing will be held on
Sept. 27th, at 10 AM. Next.

Defendant, wait. You're suspended
right now, aren't you?

Yes.

Do you always wear
your school uniform?

No-no...

Then who told you to wear it?

I just...wore it.

Do you know that lying
before the court is perjury?

Uh...um, my lawyer told me to.

When did I tell him
to wear his school uniform?

As long as we win,
why does it matter?

Oh, I forgot to tell you,
a court-appointed case came in last night.

It's in the same case batch as the
Taejin Group so that must be why.

What's the case?

An appeal for a murder case.

It got the death penalty.

Might not be a bad idea to skip this
one. Plus, it's an open-n-shut case.

Present!

What? You call them students?

You saw him in his school uniform.

That was like a sausage
stuffed with pasta.

Wow, for a court-appointed case,
the reward's pretty good.

I'm Shin-young Lee's court
appointed lawyer for her appeal.

Lawyer visiting.

She won't see you.

Excuse me?

-2234, she refuses visitation.
-What's the reason?

No clue. She probably won't
see you in the future.

The first lawyer couldn't
meet with her either.

-You have a witness today?
-ln-suk Hong. -ln-suk Hong?

-Whose bag is this?
-Lawyer Kang's.

So he got his clerk to bring it over.
He speaks slow but acts fast.

Got be quick in one way if you want to eat.

Case no. 1627.

Case no. 1627, Defendant Shin-young Lee.

Prosecution, begin your case.

On Feb. 6, 2000, the defendant
injected her husband, Jong-hoon Sung,

with drugs to render him helpless.

With a scalpel, the murder weapon,
she cut him in 4 places,

hitting arteries and veins.

Arrested on the scene,
the court sentenced her to death on June 13th.

Proceed.

Her prints on the murder weapon,
the diazepam found in the victim's body,

no evidence of intrusion,

and pre-meditation,

The scientific evidence is clear.

Given that the defendant remained
silent throughout the investigation

and the first trial,
I have no further questions.

Defense, cross examination.

You stood before this court on Feb.
6th for the murder of Jong-hoon Sung,

correct?

First, about the pre-meditation
the prosecution is claiming...

Your honor...

I don't want...this trial.

-I want it to stop.
-Defendant!

You don't have the right
to refuse this trial.

-Why not?
-Shin-young Lee.

Stop...this trial.

Shin-young Lee.

-I request a postponement.
-I said, enough!

We'll take a short recess.

I'll see both councils in my chambers.

I never asked for another trial.
Just give me the death penalty.

Let me go! Let go!
Let me just die.

Why are you doing this to me? Let go!

Han-soo, take a picture of the tub.

Careful, careful...

And the murder weapon?

A scalpel was found on the bathroom floor.

Now, you remember where
you cut him first, right?

Do it just the way you did it.

-Shin-young Lee cannot see anyone.
-Excuse me?

She's been put into solitary.

-When will she get out?
-I don't know.

Where are you two going, stuck
gether like a pair of socks?

The verdict for Lawyer Choi's
first case is in.

So you're going to the courthouse?

Yes.

No, no, no. A lawyer should
never go for the verdict.

What do you mean?

There's nothing for a lawyer to do.

Also, if you lose, they'll hang you
by your collar.

And they'll tear you apart,
asking for their money back.

Even so, isn't it our duty to explain
the verdict to our client?

I'm not telling you this for nothing.

I'll see you later.

This is the research application
I told you about.

You've made the right choice.

Wrap up the Taejin case real nice,
study abroad for about two years...

Man, I might end up working for you!

-When do I leave?
-ln November.

You have about a month or two.
I'd start getting ready.

Hello? Joon-ha Seo.

She's claustrophobic.

We found her during the morning round.
She's been moved to the hospital.

Is Shin-young Lee...

What are you doing?

-Let go! Let me go!
-Call the doctor, quick!

-Let go!
-Why are you doing this!

I wanna die...really...

-Excuse me.
-Please wait outside.

Oh, they must've been beaten bad.

Did you...go with them?

How strange...

All she needs to do is to wait.
And they'll kill her anyway.

What's her big rush?

Some people would stick to a lawyer's shadow
like a magnet to bail them out.

She barely has a chance even if she did that.

You know what?

"l want to die..." sounds more
desperate than "l want to live..."

This is the hotel where
CEO Choi is. Go see him.

Everyone has a secret or two
in their closet.

He's not the nicest guy but you know...

The paperwork looks good.

It should. When you get to my age,
you pretty much have life figured out.

Law...it's a funny thing.

The punishment fits the crime? No.

You get as much as
the laws you've broken.

What are you going to do about
the unpaid wages?

Dogs can't help but chase after cats.

When a company goes bankrupt, it is
the labor unions that bark for money.

They're all the same.

Is that so?

Don't be rash. Sit!

There. Let's talk it over.

There are three types of people
in this world.

Those who make money like madmen
and spend graciously.

Those who make money like madmen
and spend like the dogs they are.

And there are those who make money
like madmen but spend like bastards.

Like you, you bastard.

What happened?

CEO Choi gave us the boot.

Why?

Lawyer Seo must've thrown a fit.

You have proof? Show me the holes
and I'll drop him!

That's not what I'm talking about!

Give me a name of someone who pays
that much and isn't a thief!

Apologize and then leave the case!

What's with the look?

What's really up with you?
What if this affects your research candidacy?

Lie low this once and do the case.

lt could've done wonders for your career.

Who're you?

I'm Joon-ha Seo,
lawyer for the Shin-young Lee case.

Was it 3 years ago she came last...

Since then, I never called.

When she came that time, her husband
was furious and dragged her away.

Excuse me? Dragged?

It was obvious. The scales were
so tipped against her in the marriage.

My first just had her baby...

Shin-young's things are still here.

Oh, I just fed the little sucker...

The victim, Jong-hoon Sung's parents
died in a car accident last fall.

Shin-young Lee lost her mother at 12.
She was left all alone.

No siblings for both. Until 19,
Lee lived with her aunt in Choonchun.

She then worked as a nurse's aid at a
clinic in Choonchun for 3 years.

There, she met her husband.

I mean, the deceased husband.

Can you uncuff her?

Are your wounds alright?

I'm fine.

How are you doing?

Shall we begin?

I...

Let me introduce myself. I'm your
court-appointed attorney, Joon-ha Seo.

I never asked for your help.

I'm appointed by the court,
not by your request.

And if you don't like me,
you can ask or someone else. Alright?

The records say that you stabbed him
in the neck and chest during a fight...

Do I have to repeat this again?

I know it's hard but it's the
first time for me.

Was there anything you wanted to say
during the investigation or the trial?

No.

Nothing?

Nothing.

-You're satisfied with the verdict?
-Yes.

Fine. Let's say you did it. Even so,
not everyone gets the death penalty.

Depending on us, you can avoid death.
Even drop your sentence to 15 years.

I don't want that.

Even if you don't want it right now,
you must accept my help.

I never asked for your help.

If we're done, I'll go now.

And, thank you for the coffee.

After putting on make-up, you changed, correct

I object to the time of murder,
the murder wounds,

and method of murder that
the court accepted at the first trial.

-You are a security guard, correct?
-Yes.

At the trial, you testified there was
no evidence of outside intruders.

What are your working hours?

Usually from midnight to 8 AM.

And on the day of the murder?

When discovered, did the defendant
ask for your help?

No.

If an intruder killed her husband,
wouldn't she ask for your help?

-Objection! Asks for speculation.
-Nothing further.

-What is your profession?
-I am a neurosurgeon.

You worked with the deceased, correct?

Yes.

I asked you to re-examine
the autopsy reports.

There were four cuts on the body,
including arteries and veins.

-Any special characteristics?
-All four cuts were at vital points.

The defendant is weaker than the
victim and had no criminal record.

What are the odds of her finding
and stabbing those places?

Well, I'm not a forensic expert but as
a neurosurgeon, it's highly unlikely.

What about a nurse's aid
in general surgery?

Probably better than the average.

This is a copy of Shin-young Lee's
work record as a nurse's aid.

She worked at Gun-min Hospital from
March, 1992 to November, 1995.

Your records say that you sold the
defendant sedatives on Jan. 30th.

Is that correct?

Yes.

What kind of sedatives?

Diazepam.

What happens if one takes
three or four tablets?

One would lose consciousness.

Becoming completely helpless, correct?

Yes.

Is it the defendant who bought the sedatives?

Yes.

As evidence, I present the defendant's
medical record of an abortion

performed on Feb. 4th,
the day before the murder.

This is not a trial on the
private life of the defendant!

This is crucial evidence in proving
the defendant's pre-meditation.

Continue.

Would she want a baby of
the husband she hated enough to kill?

In the cruelest way, she killed the baby
in the day, the husband at night.

That is all.

Do you have any questions for the defendant?

Ms. Shin-young Lee.

Lawyer Seo, refer to her as the defendant.

Defendant...

Page 235 of the investigation report
states that you killed your husband

with a scalpel after drugging him
at your home on Feb. 6th.

You then changed your clothes and
put on make-up to run away

when you were arrested at the scene.
Is this true?

Is this correct?

Please re-examine the police video
of the crime scene.

The clothes she wore during
the crime were not found

among the evidence collected
or written in the report.

I'll ask you again.

You never murdered Jong-hoon Sung.

Answer please, Ms. Shin-young Lee.

Objection.

The defendant has already admitted
to her crime by remaining silent.

Her absent clothes prove her careful
planning to cover up her crime.

If a corpse disappeared, would you
say that is also a cover-up?

If you've killed someone, would you
hide the corpse or your clothes?

As revealed, the scalpel, diazepam,
and her confession.

The court needs no more evidence
to prove her guilt.

Now, now, what is this?

Calm down, both of you.

Prosecutor. Weren't the seized clothes
the ones she wore during the murder?

This case will be adjourned until
two weeks from today. Next.

Case no. 3215.

Case no. 3215, ll-man Choi, not in custody.

Don't get too excited.
It's only a court-appointed case.

Did you kill him?

Did you?

Tell me if you did.
Is everything they've said true?

What's wrong? Why do you want to die?

Why do you...want to know that?

As far as I know, no one kills someone to die.

If I tell you, will you
leave me alone and the trial?

No.

I can't do that.

My duty is to do whatever
it takes to save your life.

I want to help you.

No one can help me. Not even you.

I'll try.

To some, just being alive is painful.

When you're alive...you remember.

You said you'd help me, right?

Then...just leave me alone.

What's the occasion?
Inviting me to a place like this.

I'd like to get you drunk today.

You sure you're not the one
who wants to get wasted?

How come I've never seen you drunk?

I do everything in doses.

I drink, I earn,
I gain weight only so and so much.

Not like someone I know.

-You must be swamped.
-No.

You know what they say.

"You bring it on yourself."

Let me ask one favor
before I get too drunk.

Will you find all of Lee's medical records?

I guess there are no freebies.

What?

This drink must be too fancy for me.
Is this water or liquor, I'm not sure.

Yes?

Are you up? You need to come.

There is something odd in Shin-young
Lee's medical records.

She wasn't just hurt,
it was a miscarriage caused by physical abuse.

-Physical abuse? -Yes.

It seems her motive just got stronger.

Congratulations!

Hey, congrats!

Mr. Seo. Congratulations.

You don't know yet?
The list for the research candidates is posted.

-Lawyer Seo, congratulations.
-Oh, thank you.

"Joon-ha Seo, Yale Law School"

Wow, you're finally going.

Congrats.

How about some coffee?

Um...can I push the schedule back a little?

It's not at our convenience.
Don't make a big deal. Just go.

Go for M&A. The firm seems to be
eyeing a take-over or a merger.

Try being in my shoes. Keep this up and
it'll be hard for me to keep you on.

Ambition, justice, that's all good.

Believing truth and justice always go
hand in hand is a noble but silly idea.

The law doesn't always reveal the truth.

If you can't reveal the truth in
front of the law, it's all an excuse.

The orientation for research candidates
is in two days. Be realistic.

I just came by.

I didn't come to ask you anything
so don't worry.

Actually...

I don't know why I'm here myself
but I had nowhere else to go.

I must seem crazy, huh?

So this is how you do it.

Do you...always wear sneakers?

Why?

I saw you wearing them
in the courtroom, too.

You did?

-My father.
-Your father?

My father was a farmer all his life.

When he heard I became a lawyer,
he brought me a new pair of sneakers.

So I asked him why.

He said a lawyer is a person
who listens to the less fortunate.

So since the world is full of them,
I should be doing a lot of running.

I've worn sneakers from then on.

Oh, whatever I wear is up to me.

The bigger reason is, don't they look cool?

If l...gave up your case,

would you miss me?

If you're doing this because
you don't like me,

you can get someone else.

About the last time...I'm sorry.

Should I stay?

It's almost time for evening check.

I'll be going.

Don't...

don't work too hard for me.

Don't keep making me want to live.

I'll see you again.

Man, I'm really tired from the night
shift. Calling a pro in for this.

So it was simple?

The door knobs are just on backwards.
What a wacky house.

Come here! Do you wanna die? Get in!

Do as I say! I told you not to think!

-Please, honey...
-Get inside!

I solemnly swear to tell nothing but
the truth according to my conscience.

If I lie, I accept the penalty for perjury.

Proceed.

Did Shin-young Lee often visit you?

Once in awhile. But never after
her husband dragged her away.

When was that?

About 3 years ago,
a day before my sister's death anniversary.

April 15, 1997.

April 16, 1997. It was a natural
miscarriage due to an external shock.

Her condition was so serious
I transferred her to surgery.

What kind of external shock?

She said she fell down stairs.
But her injury was inconsistent with that.

-Did you meet with her husband then?
-Ultimately no.

So I asked but she said he was busy
because he was a doctor.

He didn't even show up when his wife
lost his baby by falling down stairs.

Later, I understand you performed an
abortion for her. What was the reason?

The mother didn't know she was pregnant
and had taken sedatives.

What kind of sedatives?

Diazepam.

Thank you.

Did you confirm she took the sedatives?

My patient told me.

You performed the abortion
without even confirming it?

After her miscarriage,
she suffered from severe insomnia.

She started taking the sedatives
3 years ago at my recommendation.

You've treated Shin-young Lee, correct?

Yes. Suffering from claustrophobia
in solitary, they brought her in.

How does one develop claustrophobia?

It's a fear of being locked up.

Just a shut door makes them believe
that their oxygen is disappearing.

Will you explain
why one develops such symptoms?

It can be genetic or acquired.

If you lock up a normal person,
for instance, can confinement be a cause?

Of course.

Have you heard of claustrophobia?

Yes.

Did Shin-young Lee ever show signs of it?

No. In fact, she enjoyed doing things
in her room by herself.

These are pictures of the murder scene

the home where the defendant
and her dead husband lived for 6 years.

It seems just like other townhouses
but look closely at the door knobs.

Except for the library,
the knobs are all backwards.

They lock from the outside. Inside,
one can only open it with a key.

Jong-hoon! Open the door, please!
Jong-hoon!

Confined in her home from the day
she married till the incident,

the defendant was regularly abused
by her husband.

The bedroom where the defendant
was found is also the same.

These are telephone bills of the
defendant and her deceased husband.

For 3 years from April '97,

all outgoing calls were restricted
with only basic charges.

The defendant could not ask for
outside help even if she wanted to.

And the bloodstained clothes she wore
were never found in the house.

That is all.

Start your closing.

Given that the defendant
won't claim her innocence

and it cannot be proven scientifically

it is just conjecture based
on her lawyer's presumption.

It cannot be a basis for a judgement.

The defendant has rejected making
any statement during the trial.

She shows no remorse.

Considering her meticulous planning
and callous method of murder,

we ask that the death penalty
of the first trial be upheld.

Defense, your closing.

The evidence presented towards
my client's innocence is circumstantial.

However, so is the evidence towards her guilt.

Thus the best standard to judge

this case is the great principal
protected by the constitution,

"innocent until proven guilty."

There is no conclusive evidence of
guilt or innocence in this case.

Are you going to convict because
there's no decisive proof of innocence

or vote not guilty because there's no
conclusive evidence of guilt?

I ask the court.

That is all.

There is suspicion surrounding
the defendant regarding the murder of

Jong-hoon Sung but that cannot be
the deciding factor of guilt.

In accordance with the Criminal Code,
Article 325, my ruling is as follows.

I overturn the first verdict.
Defendant Shin-young Lee, not guilty.
