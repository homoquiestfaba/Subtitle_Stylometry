You have got to be kidding me.

Ghosts?

It's exciting, right?

I'm Katherine, ghost
of Christmas Present.

This is Arlene.

She's...

Past.

And this is...

Lovely to meet you.

I'm Roy, Ghost of
Christmas Future.

Well, ah-ha, yes.

And I am calling the cops.

Ah, they won't be able to see
us, so that could be awkward.

You think I was born yesterday?

Oh.

Trust me, you're
going to need those.

Oh, this isn't happening.

This isn't happening.

But it is.

OK.

I know that you folks are fake
because I have read the book,

and this is supposed to
happen on Christmas Eve.

Used to, but it didn't
leave people enough time

to buy a Christmas goose, save
a family, make things right.

So they moved it up to the 23rd.

OK.

All right.

All right.

Well, this is crazy.

This is cray... no one
is going to believe me.

Oh, you're not going to tell
anyone because you're not

going to think it was real.

Tomorrow morning, all you'll
be left with is the feeling.

What feeling?

You're telling me
you read the book

but forgot the part
about Christmas spirit?

Susan, your music is fabulous.

"Don't You Want to Be
My Christmas Angel,"

it's one of my
all-time favorites.

Thank you.

You brought so many people
so much holiday cheer,

but I'm afraid over the years,
you've lost all of yours.

Let's say we get it
back again, shall we?

That's my cue.

You and me, sister?

What is the...

It never gets old.

Merry Christmas to all.

Hello!

Be quiet!

Hello, my wonderful neighbors.

Hey, I'm trying to
sleep over here.

Keep it down.

Merry Christmas to everyone!

Oh, would you look at that snow?

What was our time?

3 hours 37 minutes
and 14 seconds.

That's a near record.

All right, there's a
Martini calling my name.

You guys go, OK?

I'll catch up.

I haven't been back to
Hartford since... you know?

I just can't pass up the
chance to see it again.

Well, things have
changed, my dear.

It won't be the same
town you remember.

I know.

But still...

Well, don't mess anything up.

How can I possibly
mess anything up?

It's not like anyone can see me.

I will meet you in the Great
Hall well before sunrise.

I have no interest in
getting myself snapped back.

Oh, I hate that feeling.

Go.

Have an extra Martini for me.

All right.

Hm.

Everything you need for
a Christmas Eve dinner.

Who are you looking for?

We're searching all our
lives, but all I really want.

Dance, just want you...

Hi.

Can I help you?

Yep, you.

Sorry, you look very familiar.

Do I know you?

No.

I think so.

Where do I know you from?

No, you don't.

OK.

Well, great conversation.

Look, I don't really
mind, but if somebody

were to catch you in here...

Sorry.

I just... I was in the
neighborhood, and well,

I used to come here a
lot, so I wanted to...

Really?

The Rootie Tootie has been
closed since before I was born,

but I think you're thinking
maybe the Frog Hollow Angel,

did you used to volunteer there?

The Frog Hollow Angel?

It was a little community
center across the road.

It was the blue building.

Yeah.

Yes.

Yes, I did.

That's it.

That's where I
recognize you from.

Yeah.

My grandparents
actually ran that place.

Well, I saw your set up outside.

It's nothing.

It's great.

Thank you, but it
just kind of makes

me feel like they're
still here, you know?

And everybody deserves a
warm meal at Christmas.

But I'm actually just
breaking it down, so...

Oh, you store your
stuff in here?

I do.

My family owns this place.

We kind of own the whole block.

No, that's so lame.

I'm so sorry.

That sounded really terrible
coming out of my mouth.

Wow, I'm so sorry.

Not a lot of people know about
my hobby across the street,

so if you could just keep that...

Mum's the word.

Your secret is
very safe with me.

Very, very, very safe.

Good.

Just not really
aboveboard, and we've

got to get it in
before daylight.

Oh, wow, I lost track of time.

Well, I have to go.

Oh, OK.

Actually, let me deal
with this quickly.

Great.

Dealt with.

And if I could get your...

Hey, how'd it go at the center?

You bet.

Hi.

I heard you had a good one.

I want to hear about it.

Yeah, how do you like it?

Oh, hi.

There you two are.

So how were the sites?

Honestly, it was a bit strange.

I was walking around
my old neighborhood,

you know, just
having a look, and...

You were right, Roy.

Everything is different now.

Well, you'll be happy
to know I had not one,

but two Martinis for you.

That's what I like to hear.

Let's hit it.

How would you ever know
that this is the moment

to walk through that door?

They say you just know.

But it's unknowable.

It says so right there.

Unless... wait, what do
you know about the unknown

that I don't know?

Only this.

That for a ghost
to pass through,

they must first know
where they want to go.

Oh, really?

Oh, you three are up next.

Oh, and you three are
up third, or fourth.

Could be fifth, but let me
tell you, worth the wait.

My good ghosts.

Lovely to see you this fine day.

All the days are fine, Charlie.

True.

True.

Hard to find a day here
that's anything but filled

with Christmas spirit.

It's everywhere else that
could use a bit of work.

So I just got word you three
are headed back to Hartford.

You're kidding.

Two in a row?

Rare, but it happens.

So let's see who
you're matched with.

And now for your mission.

Past, Present, Future, and
your shared purpose is...

Next Christmas, the
Foodstuff Grocery Corporation

will be handed down from Robert
Baron to his son, Peter Baron.

Where's the part about how
he lost his Christmas spirit

and why he wants it back?

I'm sure you'll figure it out.

You have almost a year.

Not a better ghost team
in the whole department.

Remember, keep your
research to yourself.

What do you think,
we died yesterday?

Oh, Arlene.

Ah, this is absurd.

What, Roy?

Oh, just future things.

You know, I've never
shared any of my research.

And we should keep that
streak going, don't you think?

But Roy, there are
things I've seen

that make me wonder whether
you and I should maybe...

Hi.

Hi.

Hi.

I'm so sorry that I'm late.

What are you guys talking about?

What are you talking about?

What?

What?

What?

What?

I just got here.

Wait, are you two
like, cahooting?

Oh, no.

No.

No one's cahooting.

Oh, time to go.

Hark how the bells.

Sweet silver bells all seem
to say, throw cares away.

Or on they send, on without
end, their joyful tone

to every home.

Hark how the bells.

Sweet silver bells
all seem to say...

Were you guys
talking about Peter?

Well, he is the man of the hour.

If you two were
swapping secrets...

Who's got secrets?

So we're really going into
tonight just winging it.

You're not suggesting sharing
our research, are you?

I'm just saying we have
absolutely no idea what

we are scrooging this guy for.

I've got plenty to work with.

He's not perfect.

No, not perfect is a far cry
from being perfectly awful.

And that's how
this normally goes.

When in doubt, go back
to our shared purpose.

What shared purpose?

All they told us is that
Peter is inheriting the family

business, and that's not a
purpose, it's a headline.

Whatever Peter needs to
learn this Christmas,

it's our job to figure it out.

Come on, Roy, just give
us a little something.

Does Peter go on to like
steal from children or set

fire to Christmas trees or...

Well, I won't lie.

This is an odd one, but why
one soul or another needs

a little Christmas
magic, that has

to do with the cosmic order.

Come on, let's make
it one for the books.

No, Dad.

There's no issue.

I just kind of wanted
to go over it again.

Bring it tomorrow
for the lawyers.

Tomorrow?

Sorry, as into the
Christmas party?

Business doesn't take holidays.

Right.

Well, speaking of which,
Merry Almost Christmas, Dad.

You too.

And Dad... Dad...

Yeah.

Hello?

Hello, Peter.

What?

How did you...

OK.

OK.

All right, just let's take...

You.

Hm?

Hi.

Oh, boy.

Oh, boy.

I was really hoping that
you wouldn't remember me.

Of course, I remember you.

One minute you're there, and
then the next minute, you're...

Katherine, what is...

I know.

I know it's so bad.

I wanted to tell you
guys, but you were so

insistent not to share your
research, which I completely

respect, but this has
been eating me alive.

And I'm, honestly, just
really glad that it's finally

out in the open.

So OK.

What happened was, last
Christmas, somehow...

And I don't know
how it happened,

but somehow, this guy saw me.

Did you know about this?

Of course, I knew.

I tried to talk to you, but...

I knew you guys were cahooting.

I'm so sorry.

Could I interrupt?

Could one of you
tell me what in the...

OK, let me explain.

We are ghosts.

One more time.

Every year, we visit one
person, and only that person

is supposed to be
able to see us.

And then they're
supposed to forget us.

So really, something
is wrong with you

since you could see me,
and something is definitely

wrong with you since
you could remember me.

This is his fault?

I think I'm feeling a little...

Are you guys hot?

I'm sorry.

I never should have
said that there's

something wrong with you.

Actually, I don't
know that there's

anything wrong with you.

And that's another problem.

Katherine.

Hey, could we go back to
the part about the ghosts?

Because... wait a minute.

Are you... it's nearly Christmas.

There are three of you.

Oh, good.

You get it.

I'm Future.

She's Past.

And you are...

Ghost of Christmas Present.

What?

That... wow, I have
seen the play.

I have seen all the movies,
and the one with Bill Murray

is actually my favorite,
although the Carrie Fisher

one is really good,
a quiet little movie

underrated, certainly.

And oh, the one where
they all come together

and they're singing in
the end about how grateful

they are about how Scrooge is
dead, which is really dark now

that I think about it.

But wait a minute, am I Scrooge?

Do people hate me?

Why don't we just...

It's because I'm
spoiled, isn't it?

I knew it.

My whole life, I've tried
to fight that, you know?

Better that you just
you go on a journey.

My parents.

No, it's my parents.

I should have tried harder
to keep them together,

but I didn't.

And my therapist always said
that it was not my fault,

but I kind of felt like maybe...

Was it?

I seriously doubt it, but come
on, you strange, guilty thing.

Oh, this is exciting.

Oh, you're coming, right?

Me?

Yeah.

No.

Ah, no, no, no, no.

We all work alone.

Well, it kind of feels like
I'm a special case though.

Well as much as I would like
to see Arlene do her work,

and Arlene, I really
am so curious how

you were going to
do your work, this

is about you and your past,
and that is not some place

that I belong.

You have already
been there, so...

He's not wrong.

Thank you.

Oh, come on, Roy.

OK.

Great.

But not a peep.

M-hm.

This is going to be fun.

OK, let's all grab hands.

How about this one next?

What could it be?

Shoes.

Look, Grandpa, shoes.

Thank goodness.

Hard to imagine
there has ever been

a kid who loved Christmas
more than you did.

Well, yeah, what's not to love.

You've got the music, the
decorations, the food.

The gifts.

That's what this is about.

Yee arr.

Dad, you got me a new bike?

Yeah.

OK.

All right, yes, I got
way too many gifts,

but in fairness, I
gave half of them away.

In fact, he was furious at
me for giving anything away.

Yes, OK, have I could have
given away more, maybe

half as much more.

Does that work out
mathematically?

This is what you're
working with?

I'd give away those shoes.

Those are cheap anyways.

Merry Christmas.

Oh.

Oh.

It's the Frog Hollow Angel.

I never thought I'd
see this place again.

This is the best
Christmas present ever.

Hey, Devon.

You two know each other?

He's in my class.

I wonder, Devon, if you love
LEGOs as much as my grandson,

Peter brought his today.

Why don't you two
go build something.

Come on, Devon, let's go.

You let me know what Devon
wants for Christmas, OK?

We'll make sure he gets it.

Grandpa Bob was the best.

He was always giving everything
he had away to everyone else.

I'm going to build a spaceship.

How awesome would it
be to have a spaceship?

So awesome.

Peter, we're going
be late for dinner.

Devon, you keep them.

But they're yours.

Merry Christmas.

Hey, I just bought
those for you.

You can't just give
away your toys.

Robert, it's almost Christmas.

Don't you think it's the best
time to give away our toys?

Hey, why don't you
two skip dinner.

We've got a Santa coming.

We have reservations
at The Plaza.

Well then, Merry
Almost Christmas.

You too.

After winter break,
your dad enrolled you

in a private school.

Oh, good.

Because that's what a rich
kid needs, only rich friends.

Oh, zip it.

Sorry.

In his defense,
he's not a bad guy.

He was just sort of one
of those guys that had

a what's-ours-is-ours mentality.

It's complicated.

Moving on.

Oh, wait can...

Mom, Dad!

Grandpa, hurry!

We're not in line yet.

Your family always spent
Christmas Day at the carousel

together.

Oh, I lived for it.

It was the only day of the
year that my dad did not work.

So we did this every year.

We'd get here as
early as possible

so that we can get into
that sleigh right there,

and we go around
dozens of times.

The whole trick was to
try and not get dizzy.

No, we talked about Monday.

Right.

All right.

Fine.

I gotta get back.

A meeting came up.

But it's Christmas.

No.

No.

No.

That's not right.

My father never
worked on Christmas.

Robert, can't you just...

Business doesn't take holidays.

OK, maybe he did a little bit.

Come on kiddo.

I'll sit with you.

But I don't want to go with Dad.

He's gotta work,
sweetheart, so we're

going to stay and ride
as much as you like,

and then we'll walk home later.

Yeah, come on.

It's going to be fun.

Come on.

That was the last Christmas
for Grandpa Bob, wasn't it?

You never know something's
happening for the last time

until it's over.

By the next year, your
parents were divorced,

and it was just and your
mother at the carousel.

The year after that...

You don't need to narrate it.

It's sad enough as it is.

Are we good?

Within a couple of years,
your mom got remarried.

And there was Anna.

Cute baby.

Everybody said so.

Peter, would you take a picture?

Yeah.

You spent more and more
time alone at Christmas,

wondering where you fit.

You should have been
in that picture.

Come on, Robert,
it's a money pit.

We should sell off
the whole block.

No, I'm not selling it.

I told you before,
end of conversation.

What about you,
Peter, what do you

think about the food business?

I think it's cool,
you know, as far

as commodifying a
basic human need goes.

I'll be back.

Oh, man.

Do we have to do this part?

I'm afraid we do.

For a period of time, you
thought your loneliness could

be cured by Rachel Finkenauer.

I did.

But she didn't feel
the same way about you.

She didn't.

So that was the first
and last time you ever

opened yourself up to anyone.

To be honest, Rachel had one of
these big and happy families.

I think I was more into that
than I actually was into her.

I was also really into her.

Maybe it's not too late
for you and Rachel.

Oh, no.

She married that
guy on the pony.

Anyhow, let's see what
the following Christmas

had in store.

Yes, please.

Ah, ah.

Oh, no.

Where am I?

There I am.

Dad, come on.

We're going to be
late to our own party.

Business doesn't take holidays.

Yeah.

Yeah, I know.

You know, it seems to me like
your dad worked an awful lot

on Christmas.

Well, how come we never
have a party here?

You know how much
those things cost?

Oh, come on.

That was a great idea.

We could have had musical
guests, maybe Susan Kraine.

We scrooged Susan Kraine.

What?

No way.

Yes.

Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

Why?

What was she like?

Super scroogy.

No way.

Yes.

Well, not anymore, I hope.

Wow, I guess you
never really know

what the long-term effects are.

My dad loved Susan Kraine.

Really?

Yeah.

I remember this day.

You have his kindness, you know?

Thanks.

But his kindness was
also his weakness.

Sit, Peter.

Have you thought about the
next chapter of your life?

Like college?

After that.

Not really.

Foodstuff has been a family
business, for better or worse.

Doesn't have to
continue that way,

but it could, if
that's what you want.

Say no.

Say no.

What?

You wish you'd said no?

No.

No, I don't know.

Wait, what's the answer.

You don't know if
you want the company?

No, no, no, I want the company.

I want the company.

Who wouldn't want this company?

It's a great opportunity.

It's destiny.

Destiny is a false construct.

Really?

I was really kind of
rooting for that one.

All right.

Yes.

No, I want the company,
and if I were in charge...

If you were in charge?

You're going to be in charge.

You've been in training to
take over for years and years,

and here you are.

But you can still
choose to say no.

Peter, you're about to inherit
the keys to the castle.

Maybe we're here
because this Christmas

you need to be reminded of
the you of yesterday knew.

It could, if that's
what you want.

Of course, that's what I want.

Merry Christmas to all of us.

Happy New Year.

Happy New Year.

Oh, dear hearts.

We need a huddle.

Yes, I love a good huddle.

You're not invited
to the huddle.

Go.

Go make yourself at home.

This is my home.

See how easy that was?

Are we huddling or not?

Sorry.

Yes, OK.

Huddle.

Get out of here.

All right.

All right.

Jeez.

You guys, he doesn't
want the company.

You weren't even
supposed to see that.

Fine, but now that I have,
what if that's why we're here.

To get Peter not to
take over the business?

Why would they need
Christmas ghosts for that?

I don't know, but Arlene,
you can scrooge anyone.

And I just watched
you dance in circles...

I did not dance.

In circles trying to
figure out why this guy.

He's so not scroogy.

I mean, he's like
the anti-Scrooge.

What if he's supposed to
do something different

with his life?

You know, when I met Peter last
year, and yes, yes, I know,

that wasn't supposed
to happen, but it did,

he was staying up all night to
feed people in a parking lot.

If taking over the company means
he's going to become anything

like his dad...

Now, there's a Scrooge.

So maybe we're
here to keep Peter

from going that direction.

What if he is supposed to do
something great for the world

as long as he is free to do it.

That is something I
could imagine them

using Christmas ghosts for.

Yes.

I figured pajamas
work in the past,

but maybe it's not for me to
be hanging out in the present.

I should.

Yeah.

He's right.

Why not dress the part?

Roy.

Wow, you... very festive.

So where are we going?

What's wrong?

There was a picture of Katherine
in the community center

on the table.

She came that
close to seeing it.

And what if she had?

If she realizes how it all fits
and starts asking questions,

I just don't want
her to get hurt.

This isn't about her,
it's not about any of us.

We're here to do a job.

That's all.

That's all, right, Roy?

All is as it should be.

Tha.

My father started the
Foodstuff Grocery Corporation

with his little corner store
right here in Frog Hollow.

This was like Monday.

Oh, yeah.

So Christmas present, we get
the whole week of Christmas.

So you can see tomorrow
and the day after too?

M-hm.

And now it's my
honor to announce

that I will be passing the
torch to my son, Peter.

How did you feel in that moment?

Good.

I mean, yeah.

Yeah, it felt good.

Let's see, we got all
the bread that we can.

This is Tuesday night.

M-hm.

One for you.

OK, I have to ask.

I've seen all the movies.

I know.

The Bill Murray one
is your favorite.

It is, so much so.

But was the first ever
scrooging Scrooge?

Is that a person?

No.

OK, get this.

Dickens was a real
piece of work.

Yeah.

So he gets scrooged one
year, it changes his life.

Next thing you know...

Classic novel?

Exactly.

Yes.

And on the one hand, it's
great because when we show up,

people are like,
oh, right, you guys.

But then there's also
the whole like, hey,

where's the scary ghost of
my dead business partner?

I was actually kind of
wondering about that part.

Writers.

It's like what, this
wasn't dramatic enough?

You needed to add another ghost?

You know what's
funny, all year, I've

been thinking about who was that
woman who totally ghosted me?

Yeah.

I did.

I did totally ghost you.

Literally.

Literally.

But we got to focus.

So why don't we just...

Why don't we skip forward
to this Wednesday?

It's not realistic for me to
be coming out here with a van

and handing out sandwiches
anymore because I have

all these responsibilities.

I know you know what
happened, so if we could...

Back up about 6 hours?

Yes, please, if we have to.

Yes, we do.

You don't get to
come into work tired

because you've been up all
night playing Mother Theresa.

You don't get to tell me what
to do with my downtime, Dad.

I get to tell you
what to do when

you're putting all that
I've worked for on the line.

You don't think it's
a little extreme.

You're out there
using a company van.

One call to the
city, we'll be buried

in lawsuits over food safety.

Shut it down.

OK, he's not... he's not
bad, he just grew it more.

Wait, I thought your grandfather
started this company.

That makes for a really great
story more than anything,

but in reality, he made some
pretty bad financial decisions

for the block and Frog Hollow.

Ew, yeah, he mean this block?

The one that your family owns?

Oh, come on.

I'm never going to
live that down, am I?

No, probably not.

OK.

Well, do technically own it.

My grandfather basically bought
it one building at a time.

And he and my grandmother,
they had this vision.

They were going to
turn this street

into a place for everyone.

They were going
to turn the Rootie

Tootie into this free
venue with music and food.

And there'd be a
shelter, daycare, and all

of these really cool ideas.

But I guess not that practical,
and they sunk all their money

into it.

So there were some rough
years, to say the least.

But you know what
the amazing thing

is that my grandfather, even
though he was struggling,

he still gave everything
that he had away.

So the community center went
under, but what happened to it?

My grandfather ran it
until the day he died,

and then my dad
took it over, and...

But in his defense, the
place was not built to code,

and fines kept piling up.

And he wasn't doing
it to be mean,

but it didn't make
sense for the business,

and therefore, it didn't
make sense for the family.

And I don't know,
it's just complicated.

Complicated.

Yeah, you said.

My dad is an
amazing businessman.

He took this struggling
little grocery company,

and he turned it
into this big thing.

I just feel that he believes
that to be successful,

you need to be tough.

Do you think he's right?

I don't know.

And he built an empire,
and I'm just inheriting it.

So if your dad is this
amazing businessman,

why is he holding
on to all of this?

It can't be cheap.

It's all about the bottom line.

Trust me, if the math doesn't
add up, my dad will sell it.

I do know he has
some plans though.

And the Rootie Tootie
and the warehouse.

You can't let that happen.

Oh, yeah.

Right.

No, you're going to be the boss.

Don't let that happen.

He's still going to
be head of the board.

I'm not really going to have
much more power than I do now.

But enough about
me, how about you?

What?

Oh, come on.

Tell me something
about yourself.

Uh-ah.

I don't think so.

That's not how this works.

Says who?

OK, what do you want to know?

Anything.

How about maybe how you...

How I died?

Oh, is that super
basic of me to ask?

Yes, I get it every
single scrooging.

Oh, Yikes.

OK.

OK.

Where did you grow up?

OK, it's not
completely original,

but it is an improvement.

Right there.

It used to be an
apartment complex.

I grew up there with my grandma.

Really?

You grew up right there.

M-hm.

Of course, you did.

I mean, what was
your grandma like?

You tell me.

What was your grandma like?

My grandma, I didn't
really know her.

She passed away
when I was young.

My grandma would put on a
full face of makeup just

to stay home in the afternoons
and listen to her stories.

Stories on the radio.

I'm not sure if you
know what that is.

It's kind of like a TV,
but without the picture.

Do you mean like a podcast?

What?

I don't know if you
know what that is.

I know what that is.

This kind of feels
like the moment

where I would say that
you're really funny and cool.

And I would like to buy
you a drink some time.

Come on, Peter,
there's more to see.

Thanks, Hannah.

I had a feeling we
were coming here.

Oh, OK.

Well, why don't I just go.

You can scrooge yourself.

I'm just saying I already
told my mom that I can't

make Christmas Eve dinner.

That it was a long shot.

Besides, it's like
a very busy week.

We've got the press
and the logistics.

He's got a busy schedule.

It's fine.

We should eat
before it gets cold.

She misses you when
you're not here.

She's got her family.

You are her family.

I'd just make
things complicated.

Haven't we established
that things are also

complicated with your dad?

No, actually, things with
my dad are quite simple,

as long as you just
talk about work.

Well, you do manage to make
it to his Christmas Eve party.

I heard you were handing
out food in the parking lot.

I'm glad your father
talk some sense into you.

If you go giving up
food for free, then

who's going to pay for it?

He wants to do good,
and I applaud that.

But I keep telling him,
you want to do real good,

make as much as you can
and write a few big checks.

Standing out in the cold
giving away sandwiches

isn't going to
make a difference.

This is painful.

This is so painful.

Why don't I say something?

Come on, say something.

Excuse me.

Where do I go?

There I am, a
little hiding spot.

I'm a coward.

You don't remember how you die.

That part is blank, and
maybe that's a good thing.

I don't know.

But however it happened, I
didn't know it was coming.

I wasn't sick or anything.

And I really thought
that I was going to do

great things with my life.

I just thought that I had
lots of time to do them.

But it's like you
said, you never

know when something is
ending until it's over.

I'm going to tell you something
I probably shouldn't tell you,

OK?

I'd be really upset
if you didn't.

Usually when we
scrooge someone, it

is all so obvious at
what they need to learn,

but with you, it's been tough.

I bet.

And no, you're not perfect.

OK, that's been established.

But this Christmas magic,
it's really special.

So if we're supposed
to use it for you,

then there must be something
about this moment that's...

You know, Christmas is a
time for people who are lost.

It's a time for them to
remember who they really are.

And you think I'm lost?

Well, that's not for me
to say, Peter, but I mean,

if I could go back, I
wouldn't waste a minute.

I would have just
been so much braver.

Well, if I were
braver, I would...

I'd turn down taking
over the company.

Yeah, it's not what I want.

Never has been.

Whoa!

What was that?

Ah, did you just
get snapped back?

Why did that happen?

It only happens if we overstay.

I'm so sorry.

What is happening right now?

Wait, Roy?

Roy, is that even possible?

Congratulations, my dear boy.

You must have
learned your lesson.

Yeah, thank you, but
I'm so sorry, what?

You're done, kid.

No.

I just... I just feel like
there are more things

that I need to show you.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And you know, I feel like I need
a lot more time in the present

to really work through things.

And no offense, Roy, but
the whole graveyard scene

was not really my bag.

I'd love to skip that part.

Not how it goes.

When it's done, it's done.

It doesn't feel done.

Well, Peter, you can't just
say it, you have to believe it.

If you really believe that
you need more Christmas magic,

then I'm sure there's
more for you to take.

Whew.

Whew.

Whew.

You can't just do that.

Sorry, what?

You can't flirt with me.

Well, you wanted more time.

Only because I thought
you had more to learn.

Maybe we both have
more to learn?

No, my learning days are over.

So you're telling me that
being back here where

you grew up, after all of
this, you don't feel anything?

Because as soon as
this night is done,

you're just going to
go back to wherever

it is that you go
between Christmases,

and I'm never going
to see you again.

Yeah.

Oh.

I love it when it
snows on Christmas.

Snow fall puts you
in the present.

Well, you'd be the
expert at that.

Close your eyes.

Close my eyes?

Yeah.

Let the snow fall on your face.

2 to 3 seconds, that's
how long it takes

to register the present moment.

Whoa.

So just to be clear...

Yeah.

We're here to work.

Absolutely.

I need to show you things.

Definitely.

Yeah.

Like this guy.

That is a very lonely
way to spend Christmas.

No, not at all.

Do you want to go for a ride?

No, I'm fine.

I'm fine.

Really, I'm fine.

OK.

A little better.

Could we go, please?

Yes.

What are we waiting for?

Oh!

You can give me a
little warning, I think.

No, it's way more fun this way.

So what's it like being magical?

I'm not magical, I
just get to use magic.

I think you are pretty magical.

Ugh, bad guy.

Well, to be fair, that
guy can't see the magic.

He feels like a
stranger, honestly.

He has no idea what destiny
has in store for him.

What?

Life is a series of choices.

Do you believe that?

Yeah.

Yeah, I do.

Oh, there's something else
that I need to show you,

something else that
happens this Christmas.

That's never not
going to be weird.

Is that Rachel Finkenauer?

Peter Baron?

Wow.

Oh, my god, I can't believe it.

Wow, hi.

Oh, yeah, you look great.

So do you.

Thanks.

Thanks.

Oh, is Jack... he's
working, I'm assuming.

We're separated.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, don't be.

I'm not.

Is that my future?

If that's what you want.

OK.

So I'll call my dad
tomorrow, tell him the truth,

and I will go from there.

Shall we?

Yes, we shall.

Merry Christmas, Peter.

Merry Christmas, Katherine.

Ah!

Hey, Dad, it's me.

Sorry to be calling so early,
but I didn't want to wimp out.

So here it goes.

I don't want the
company, and it's not

just that I don't want
to take over the company,

I don't want to be
anything like you.

And now, I immediately
want to apologize for that,

but no, no, I'm not going to.

I'm not sorry because, yeah
Grandpa Bob was pretty bad

with money, but he was so
good in so many other ways.

And quite frankly,
I would rather

be broke and good
than rich and broken.

So bye.

Oh, and Merry Christmas.

Cheers.

My good, ghosts.

Trust it went well?

It was delightful.

So Robert Baron's Christmas
spirit is fully restored.

You mean Peter Baron.

Yes, I believe his full
name is Robert Peter Baron.

But he goes by Peter.

Pretty sure he goes by Robert.

Peter.

Robert.

Charlie.

I don't know what to say.

Everyone in the Department of
Cosmic Order is flabbergasted.

This is simply unprecedented.

The book never gets
anything wrong.

I have a feeling
it's not so much

the book as a book's handler.

Let's just move
forward, shall we?

Because there is
no moving backward.

Though you might
disagree there, Arlene.

I'm about to move your face
forward into this table.

Right.

So you had the wrong guy.

Yes, Charlie.

We know.

So tell us what happens now.

What are we doing?

Are we going back to
Hartford next year

to scrooge Peter's dad?

Goodness, no.

I guess that's
probably for the best.

I mean, it's probably time
I say goodbye to Hartford

once and for all.

You're going to
get back out there

and scrooge Peter's
dad right now.

Just get back out there
and make sure Robert

learns all the usual stuff...
Greed, bad; family, good.

But it's already sunrise.

Not to worry.

I've gotten you an extension.

You're most very
welcome, and you

can thank me on your own time.

How long have we got?

Till sundown, an additional
nine hours on Earth.

OK.

But we haven't
done any research.

This feels impossible.

Said no, Ghost of Christmas.

Anything ever, not
impossible in the least.

Did I mention that
Robert can't see you,

and you can't guide him
through his life, obviously.

What?

Well, if you used
your one scrooging

this Christmas for Peter,
you can't use it for Robert,

now can you?

How are we supposed
to scrooge Robert

without being able
to scrooge Robert?

Yeah.

Charlie, you've got
us the extra time.

Just gives us the
extra scrooging.

Sorry, no can do.

Well, you know who else
no can do, this ghost.

OK, Arlene, look, what I think
Arlene is trying to say is what

if we can't?

I mean, what happens then?

The entire fabric of the
universe may collapse.

Or maybe just no
more Christmases.

We don't know.

It's never happened before.

Anywho, if I were you,
I would get going.

Tick tock.

Wait, Charlie.

Charlie.

Charlie.

Ah, if Robert can't see
us and we can't guide him,

our hands are tied.

I only see one option.

He likes you.

We need him.

Come on, you guys.

By now, he probably
doesn't even remember me.

He remembered you last time.

Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

Peace on Earth.

Hey, Peter, what's this?

Oh, hey, yes.

That is a peppermint patty
with a white chocolate ganache.

It's a family recipe.

So you made enough for
everyone on the floor?

Whole building.

Yeah.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas to you.

Hey.

Hi.

Oh, you remember me?

Yeah.

Wow.

Good.

Gosh, you know, I'm so curious.

They say it feels
like a fever dream.

No, it kind of felt
like we were hanging out

for the whole night.

So yeah, I guess something
is wrong with me.

Sh.

What?

Why are you shushing me?

Well, it looks like you're
talking to yourself.

What?

I'd put those in the fridge
because they melt rapidly.

So Merry Christmas.

So I'm confused as
to why you're still...

Yeah.

So I'm not here guiding
you through your life.

I'm visiting your life.

Right.

I got that.

And that is exactly why we
come in the middle of the night

because if people
see you talking

to yourself in the middle of
the day, it is so much worse.

I get that too.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I forgot you're the expert.

Was the scene in the
Bill Murray movie?

Hey.

Hey.

Hey.

Katherine, you seem
a little stressed.

Do I?

Yeah.

Why are you here?

I mean, it makes sense.

He's definitely like the
epitome of a scrooge, isn't he?

Like right down to the peacoat.

Well, so what do
you want from me?

Well, basically, we need you
to be us, and will help you.

We will help you figure
out how to get in there

and open him up.

I'm so sorry.

It's just when you
said open him up,

I've been trying to
open up my father,

and it has never worked.

I'm telling you, you will
just be wasting your time.

OK.

See, this sounds
like a challenge,

and I love a challenge.

Who was it said, um, life
is a series of choices?

I don't know.

You have no idea?

Nope.

So this is me making a choice.

OK, I'm going to level with you.

Look, in the entire
history of Christmases,

there has never been an
unsuccessful scrooging,

and we cannot be the
first team to fail.

But you didn't fail.

Do you know where I'm
going later today?

To make pies with my mom.

And then afterwards,
I'll go to the carousel

and see how that goes.

Great.

That's great.

But your dad.

I'll just let it go.

I've got some pies
I'm going to make.

Well, that wasn't
your best work.

Thank you.

I don't know.

Maybe he's right.

Do you think Peter knows
more about the cosmic order

of things than our higher ups?

Wait a minute.

Wait, what if this
wasn't a mistake?

What if... like you always say,
Roy, all is as it should be?

Not you two.

Guys, what if we are here
for Peter and Robert?

That's looking good, Peter.

I was worried I wouldn't
be seeing you today.

You're going to be
seeing a lot more of me.

I promise.

Peter.

What are you doing?

Come here, real quick.

I can't.

Go away.

Go away.

Come here, please, really quick.

Go away for a second.

Just go.

Peter.

Hi.

These earbuds,
it's going... yeah.

Gosh, I didn't
even realize you...

Yeah, they keep getting
smaller and smaller.

Let me... I'm just going
to go take them out.

Hey.

Hey, I know.

I know.

I know.

I'm sorry.

But Peter, what do you want?

I thought this was about my dad.

Yeah, I'm still asking.

What do you mean, like
if I could have anything?

You can have anything.

What, are you printing
bumper stickers now?

I'm serious.

I would want...

I would want... I would want
my life to mean something,

like my grandfather's
life meant something.

I would reopen the Frog Hollow
Angel, except some place built

to code and that's sustainable.

But come on, that's
not realistic.

Why?

Why not?

Because my grandfather
poured his whole life

into that place, and
then it just went under,

and he was dependent
on my father.

And I cannot do that.

Because I know this
sounds stupid, but as much

as I want to do
something that matters,

I also want my father's respect.

That doesn't sound dumb.

Maybe your dad just
needs to be a part of it.

Come on, companies
have charitable arms.

Not this one.

Not yet, but it does
have the perfect location

for a community
center, a big one

that's already built
to code, a place

that your grandparents
had a vision for.

Did you just forget the
part where my dad was

going to turn that into...

I don't know, a warehouse?

Peter, I'm not just
thinking about you.

Your father needs some
Christmas magic too,

a stingy tycoon opening
a community center

to feed the hungry is 100% what
scroogings were designed for.

You need your father just
as much as he needs you.

Right.

But he'll never go for it.

Peter, people can change.

I have been doing this for
a long time, and trust me,

people like your dad can change.

Ooh, there is one problem.

The voicemail that
I left him, I doubt

he would even take my call.

Oh, come on.

Like, he's probably
changed the locks.

How harsh was that voicemail?

Real harsh.

OK, that's fine.

Let's just think about this.

How else can we get to Robert?

How can we get to Robert.

What does he like?

He loves money.

He loves business.

He loves... hey, Mom,
I gotta out for a bit.

Where are we going?

Well, Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas, Susan.

Just follow me.

Follow me into my home.

Here you go.

Wow.

Oh, and this... this is
my Santa's workshop.

Oh, it's so big.

Big?

Oh, come on, Peter.

Look alive.

Ask about the little
elves on the mantle.

Don't question me.

I'm a pro.

Oh, so I was wondering, could
you tell me about the gilded...

Oh, my gold plated elves.

Aren't they just rare beauties?

Sometimes I carry these little
babies with me in my purse

because they're just,
they're so yummy.

And she's ready to welcome.

In for the kill, pretty boy.

So it's clear you've gotten
your Christmas spirit back,

and it's so amazing.

Thank you.

Speaking of Christmas
spirit, it's

what I wanted to talk
to you about today.

I was wondering...

I was wondering if...

Ah, spit it out.

Spit it... if you'd
happen to have seen...

I wish I could just jump in
his body and control him.

What was that movie?

Ghost.

I'm sorry, what did you say?

Ghosts.

Plural.

Three of them.

Does that ring a bell?

Yes, that sounds very familiar.

And you do not even want
to know about the rabbit

hole of twisted
subconsciousness I

can go down if you add
some pepperoni and mushroom

to that bad boy.

Really?

Yeah, but in all of my
years, I have never, ever

had a dream like that.

I swear to all that
is holy, I thought

I'd done some astral travel.

I mean, it is the only
way to explain how

lucid that dream felt to me.

So oh, boy, when you
told me it was real,

see, that's how it's
supposed to feel.

Something is definitely
wrong with you.

I mean, I would say we should
get you checked out, but like,

by who?

Thank you.

So are they in the
room right now?

They most definitely are.

Even the handsome
one with the ascot?

Oh, isn't she delightful?

Oh, the ascot is here.

So.

So.

So.

So.

Peter.

Oh, yes, as in, so
what do you want?

Right.

We would like your help.

I think we need a statement
for the press, you and Peter

together.

It won't be necessary.

It's simple.

I changed my mind.

That's weird.

What time is it?

No one should be
arriving until...

Oh, hello.

Merry Christmas.

Oh, Merry Christmas.

Oh, Robert Baron.

Susan Kraine.

Yes.

Oh, I hope this isn't
too much of an intrusion.

Not at all.

What can I...

You know, I know this
must sound very strange,

but you have such
a wonderful son.

Peter?

Peter, yes.

He tracked me down and asked
would I consider singing

at your Christmas Eve party.

He what?

He did.

And then when he told me
that you were a fan of mine,

I said no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

I am the fan of you,
you silly goose.

Oh, I loved your father.

You knew my father?

M-hm.

What he did at that
community center

all those years,
oh, what a love.

And I'm sure that you have got
that same charitable streak.

And as it turns out,
Christmas Eve parties

are my absolute favorite event
to play, if you would have me.

Sleigh bells through the town.

Hear the carols singing loud.

All I want for
Christmas is you here.

Your love is like a gift
all through the year.

Deck the halls of my heart.

That was beautiful.

Thank you.

Wow, that is the cheeriest
I've ever seen my father.

Then I guess it's now or never.

OK.

Wish me luck.

Oh, we're coming with you.

OK.

Yeah, great.

So just remember, talk about
the personal, not about work.

And you really
gotta push the past.

OK, wait to see a
tear before you...

Actually, I know it.

So sorry.

I think I got it, guys.

OK.

I'm good.

I got it.

Oh, ain't that the truth?

That's the truth.

Exactly.

Hi.

Hi.

Dad.

Susan, I mean, amazing.

Thank you so much.

No.

No.

No.

Thank you.

Thank you for asking me.

You know your dad
and I were just

discussing how easy it is to
forget what Christmas is really

all about.

Family.

Yes.

Yeah, family.

Yes, if you think
about the Christmases

of your past and
you compare them

to the Christmases
of the present

and then you ask
yourself, what do

I want the Christmases of
my future to look like,

and it all comes back to...

Families.

Yeah.

Yeah, right.

I mean, it's just so...

They're so right.

Well, you know what,
I am going to go

get myself an adult beverage.

Oh, yes.

Please, why don't you just...

You too talk about...

Well, important things.

Great.

Yeah, she's lovely.

I'm surprised you came.

Well, it's Christmas Eve.

I think it's going well.

Right, don't you
think it's going well?

Because I can't trust you.

How can you even say that to me?

Oh, yeah.

Just peachy.

You don't know the value
of fiscal responsibility.

You don't know the
value of people, Dad.

Excuse me.

Peter, just wait.

OK.

Peter.

Katherine.

I can't.

I'm done.

I just can't with him.

Will you please just talk to me.

Everything was fine
until you showed up.

I was fine.

Were yo?

Yes, I was fine.

I was doing what I was supposed
to be doing, what I was raised

to deal, which is just keep
my head down and my emotions

in check because they only
ever get me into trouble.

Oh, Peter, stop.

Please, people are
looking at you.

I know people are
looking at me because I'm

talking to a ghost in
the middle of the day.

Let's go.

Go where, my dear?

Home.

We don't belong here.

Look, I know it's hard
to believe right now,

but everything is...

As it should be?

Come on.

What is any of this even for?

What are we doing here?

Peter doesn't need us.

Robert can't hear us.

Nothing makes any sense.

Because it's not about them.

No time to explain.

Do you know where Peter went?

No.

No need to talk, Peter.

I have no intention of
being the first ghost

to get someone institutionalized.

I can't take your
dad to the past.

Yeah, I know.

But I can take you back again.

There's something
I want you to see.

No, thanks.

I'm not really asking, Peter.

It would be cold outside.

My heart so is warm.

We're searching all our
lives, but all I really want.

Wait, is this...

No, this is wrong.

This is my past.

It's Peter's past as well.

Just you.

Just you, baby.

Keep watching.

All our lives,
but all I really want.

Bets.

Is that Grandma Betsy?

Betsy Wilkins was your grandma?

Wilkins was her maiden name.

She was my best friend.

We grew up together.

Wait.

Wait.

So this means, are you here?

Well, I will be.

I'll be coming through.

I used to meet her every
night after her shift,

so we could walk home together.

Hey, good to see you guys.

Merry Christmas, Katherine.

Merry Christmas, Gabe.

Hungry?

Oh, starved.

How about a grilled
cheese to go.

You bet.

Kat.

Hey.

I've got two more tables,
and then we're out of here.

Take your time.

There you go.

How's clerical school?

Thank you.

It's all right.

Not the dream, huh?

I'll be glad to
have the work, but I

think that's all it'll be.

There's nothing wrong with work.

Never mind.

No, it's going to sound silly.

Try me.

Ah.

Well, I just feel like
there's so much more

that I could be doing for the
world to make a difference.

So what are you waiting for?

I don't know.

I just feel like I
have to figure out how.

There's no time
like the present.

I'm freezing.

Let's go.

And then he actually
snapped his fingers at me.

What?

I can't believe...
Can you believe

the gall of that man to
assume that I'd be there just

to serve him.

I wanted to say, listen,
mister, get your own drink.

I didn't, of course?

Hi.

Oh, here you go.

This is for you.

And I'm so sorry this is
all I have for tonight.

Thank you, Katherine.

Don't you be sorry.

You're an angel.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Goodnight.

Ooh, did that man
get on my last nerve.

If he comes in again...

I think it's
terrible that anyone

should have to live that way.

It's going to be
so cold tonight.

I wish they could spend the
night in the Rootie Tootie,

you know?

I mean, why should it sit
empty all night when people

are sleeping in the street?

That's a very good question.

You should ask Gabe.

He's into all that
charity stuff.

Yeah.

Good, this place
is finally open.

Grandpa Bob.

Grandpa Bob?

No way.

All the home.

Thank you.

Hi, there.

I'm in need of some gum.

Well, you're in luck.

Gum is something
I've got plenty of.

Grandpa Bob, you rascal.

Cold out there.

Yeah, how much are
these blankets?

$5 even.

You can't spend everything
you've got on other people.

They could freeze.

There's a family over there.

Kat already gave
them her dinner.

It's Christmas.

Everyone deserves a warm meal.

It's on me.

Really?

Wow, that is so kind.

What about it?

I've got some produce in
back that's going to go bad.

I know it would go to good use.

Well, he's dreamy, isn't he?

What do you think?

You think he likes me?

Betsy, I've always said there's
not a soul alive whose heart

you couldn't make beat faster.

Faster.

Wow.

Thank you.

And no need to thank me.

I should do this more often.

He'd be sick at how much
food ends up in the trash.

Well then, maybe we should start
stopping by here every night.

Oh, shoot.

I just realized I forgot
to pick up my tips.

I can run those things over.

Oh, no.

No.

No.

It's OK.

I'll do it.

I'll do it.

I want to run that
idea by Gabe anyway.

No time like the present, right?

Thank you.

I will just take that.

Oh, gosh.

Thank you.

I trust you won't get into
any trouble while I'm gone.

Have I ever?

It was nice meeting you.

So we have 13 different
flavors and 7 different shapes.

My personal favorite...

Go.

You died on Christmas.

Yeah, we all did.

That's how it works.

Bet you didn't catch that, huh?

No.

I mean, I always wondered.

I hope it wasn't a
mistake bringing you here.

No, it wasn't.

I'm just glad it was
me and not Betsy.

I'm glad you are here.

Me too.

We have one more stop to make.

OK.

Katherine Marley was a very
special part of our community.

And ever since she passed
away, a year ago now,

we've been trying
to figure out what

we could do to celebrate her.

That's why you look so
familiar when we first met.

That picture was on the
table at the community

center at all times.

Oh, I can't believe
I never asked

my grandfather who you were.

Now, to kick things off, I'm
going to call up Betsy Wilkins.

Excuse me, Betsy Baron.

Kat was my best friend, best
person I have ever known,

always thinking
about everybody else.

She died trying to help
people on Christmas,

and Kat was going to
help a lot more people.

She just needed time
to figure out how.

And see, I don't really
believe in accidents.

I think all is as it
should be, but that's

so hard to understand when
something like this happens.

But maybe, if the rest
of us live our lives

just a bit more like Kat,
it'll start to make sense.

So today we're
announcing that we

bought a little piece of
land right across the street,

and we're going to build a
community center over there

in Kat's honor.

She's our angel now.

So that's what it'll be
called, the Frog Hollow Angel.

You know, Kat...

Oh, I wish I knew
what else she wrote.

So when the Frog
Hollow Angel closed,

everything got stored
in the basement.

Newspapers, don't need those.

Wait.

Oh, wow, that's wild.

Moment of Truth.

Please, please be there.

Oh, Betsy.

Be careful.

Regardless, as it should
be, to cross the street.

Any luck?

He's not in here.

OK.

I bet you he's in
his grumpy place.

He has a grumpy place?

Yeah.

I thought that was
just his resting state.

Yep, see.

There he is.

OK.

Well, I'm going to go.

Give you guys some privacy.

Oh, you sure you don't want
to stay behind and push me

onto the tracks?

You know, I'm not worried.

Why?

He's your dad.

So all of that good
stuff has to be there.

Yeah.

Just speak from the heart.

And remember that no
matter what happens,

all is as it should be.

It sounds a bit like destiny.

Maybe it is.

Dad, I know you think that I
idolized grandpa, and I did.

I always idolized you more.

I did.

Why do you think I even
took a job at the company?

I just wanted to spend
more time with you.

But I can't pretend to
be something I'm not,

and I don't want to
take over the business.

Yes, you made that
perfectly clear.

But that doesn't mean that I
don't want to be a part of it.

You always said that this
was a family business, right?

And that part always confused
me because I don't say,

I always thought it was more of
a marketing ploy than anything.

But I'm starting to
think that maybe you

called it that because that's
what you wanted it to be.

Maybe that's why you never sold
off that block in Frog Hollow.

Maybe you got into
the grocery business

so that you could spend
more time with your dad.

My dad gave away everything
he had to strangers,

not just money, his time,
his love, all of it.

I may not be perfect,
but everything I've done

has been informative for
you, so you would never

have to worry the way I did.

You have no idea
what that's like.

You're right.

I don't.

And I'm very, very lucky.

Dad, there are so many
people out there spend

their whole lives
worrying like you did.

So why can't we be the family
that takes care of each other

and takes care of other people?

I have a proposal for you.

I think that we should carry
out grandma and grandpa's dream

and turn the Rootie
Tootie into a gathering

place for the whole
community, and I

think we should do it together.

That's why you're here?

No, I'm here because I
want to make you proud,

and I want to make
Grandpa proud,

and I wanna make myself proud.

And you know who else
want to make proud?

Grandma.

I never really knew
her, but I wish I had.

For Kat.

That was her friend.

Died young, I think.

Where did you find this?

Read it.

And if you're still
interested in what

I think you and I could build
together, I'd love to tell you,

Dad, it's not just my
legacy, it's yours too.

Kat was my best friend,
best person I've ever known,

always thinking
about everybody else.

She died trying to help
people on Christmas,

and Kat was going to
help a lot more people.

She just needed time
to figure out how.

And see, I don't really
believe in accidents.

I think all is as it
should be, but that's

so hard to understand when
something like this happens.

Maybe if the rest of us live our
lives just a bit more like Kat,

it'll start to make sense.

So today we're
announcing that we

bought a little piece of
land right across the street,

and we're going to build a
community center over there

in Kat's honor.

She's our angel now, so
that's what it'll be called,

the Frog Hollow Angel.

You know, Kat was there
when I met my husband, Bob,

and we just found out that we're
having a little one of our own.

I hope we raise this baby to be
as loving and generous as Kat

was every day of her life.

Because it wasn't
just on Christmas

that she was an angel,
it was every day.

So it looks like this
is actually the...

Yeah, I guess so.

Are you going to the
carousel tonight?

You know what,
don't answer that.

I'm not going, Katherine.

I don't really understand
what any of this means,

but I do know this one
very important thing, which

is that you are somebody
that I could love,

and I think that you
could love me too.

Now, that I know
that that's possible,

I don't ever want to settle.

And if I never feel this
way again, then at least

I felt it once, this
really kind, funny,

and beautiful ghost.

Go.

All right.

Not so fast, my dear.

Not so fast?

We have 5 minutes.

You know, in all my
years as a ghost,

never have I ever finished
a Christmas season

without a visit to the future.

Who are you going to
take to the future?

Please tell me right now
that you realize that you

were always the assignment.

Te

Just so I can see all the
people I'm going to scrooge

and how I'll help them?

Well, that's one future.

Sure, I can take you
there if you like.

You got 2 minutes, Roy.

But why would I
take you to a future

that you could already imagine?

Oh, that's...

I can't.

I can't have any of that.

Why would you show it to me?

All I can tell you is
that if you could see it,

it must exist somewhere.

60 seconds.

But be brave enough to
see where you want to go.

OK.

I know where I want to go.

That never gets any less awful.

You think they'd find a
gentler way to transport us.

So what's the verdict?

Don't worry, Charlie.

We cleaned up your mess.

Oh, that's a relief.

Well then, allow me.

Are we coming, or...

I hope whatever is through
there is exactly what you want.

Roy, I wish you
could come with me.

I'll be with you every
step of the way, my dear.

And Arlene.

Oh, no need for a scene.

Thank you.

For what?

Just for being you.

All right.

Well, before I get
downright soggy...

Bye.

So you're really going to do it.

Yeah.

Oh, thank goodness.

I tell you, this
was a hectic one.

Time, you know, it
is a funny thing.

It would be so much
easier if it was linear,

but as it is, sometimes we need
to speed someone up or slow

someone else down just to make
sure that all souls are where

they're supposed to be when
they're supposed to be their.

Souls as in soulmates.

Am I speaking kangaroo?

Yes, soulmates.

You don't even want to
know all the strings that

got pulled last year so
that boy could see you.

And then remember you?

You know what,
forget I said that.

Take good care, Katherine.

Thank you, Charlie.

Hello.

Oh, hey there.

Hi.

Sorry, do I know you?

Yeah, you look really familiar.

Hm.

Are you lost or...

No.

You're not looking for anyone.

And I found exactly
who I'm looking for.

It's OK.

So what do you think?

I think it's going
to be a lot of work.

Yeah.

And a lot of fun.

Yeah.

And I think it's probably our
destinies, so let's do it.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

There you go.

Something to eat.

Make yourself at home.

All I want for
Christmas is you here.

Your love is like a gift
all through the year.

Deck the halls of my heart
because on Christmas...

Hey, how's it going?

Great.

Hey, question, who's that?

Oh, that's Betsy.

You see, this place
is named after her.

She's the Frog Hollow Angel?

That's right.

Hi.

Hey.

I just wanted to
bring you some food.

Oh, thank you.

My parents would be
incredibly proud.

Oh, well, thank you.

No, I meant of me.

Thank you, Peter,
for all of this.

Yeah, of course.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

All I want for
Christmas is you here.

Your love is like a gift
all through the year.

Deck the halls of my heart.

'Cause on Christmas,
I need you by my side.

Won't you be my Christmas angel.

So wanna dance?

Absolutely.

Angel.

Angel.

My angel.

Angel.
