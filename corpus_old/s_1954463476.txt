Good luck to all you students
on your finals.

before you hit the bars.

Hi handsome.



A small isolation study

measuring all potential side
effects.

There will be five doses of
the drug,

given in two day intervals

physical exams

Because I'm...
No, I just...

Not happening.

Well, let's take a look.

Here we are.

No prostate exams, tape tests,
or anal winks.

No probes, enemas,
or rectal tubes.

I don't know what an anal
wink is, but,

I prefer not to have it.
Me either.

Feel free to review the protocol
yourselves.

Ravexin Pharmaceutical presents
RXZ-19.

The promise of the future.

Okay. What's it for?

As for compensation...

Subjects will receive $225
a day.

$225 a day... that's like...

It's $3,000.

To be precise, it's $3,150.

We'll do it.

So we miss a couple classes.
Big deal.

anyways.

Man, we're gonna miss Christmas
break.

C'mon. Fuck Christmas break.

we make some easy, EASY money,

and then come summertime,

we can go on a real vacation.

Europe.

And even you can get laid
there.

How many girls have you slept
with?

Many... one.

Yeah. We're doing it.

RXZ-19 is a theta class molecule

in the search for wide grade
antihistamine.

Okay, here we go. Including...

Nausea, dry mouth,

arrhythmia,

constipation and or diarrhea?

Can you even have both at
the same time?

And why are you even reading
that?

RXZ-19? Allergies?

C'mon.

Are you kidding me?

Because we were short on beer
money?

They paid us what? $20?

To play that game with all
the weird rules?

So?

This is-this is... Ravexin
Pharmaceutical, man.

They sold $14 billion in drugs
last year!

Good. Good.

Because she's paying us $3,150.

I dunno. This is...

By the way.

That doc...

She is a babe.

The best things in life
are free,

But you can take it to the
bird sand bees.

I need money.

What I want.
That's what I want.

What I want.
That's what I want.

What I want.

That's what I want.


Your love gives me such
a thrill.

But your love don't pay
my bills.

I need money.

That's what I want.

Can't be any worse than our
dorm.

Right, right.

And think about the money.
Yeah.

And Europe.


Right this way, gentlemen.

if you please.

Put your bags on the table here.

Both of em.
Alright.

And those cells. Lemme have
those cells.

Yeah. Yours too.

Okay.

No pictures allowed in the
facility.

What are you guys looking for?

The usual: dope, junk food,

cameras, cell phones.

And liquor.

Wait, are you serious?
I can't have that?

I didn't see that in the
pamphlet.

Yeah. We'll hang onto this
for you.

You can get it back when your
trial's over.

Patty, they're all yours.

(Door buzzes open)

(Door clangs shut)

Mind the clock.

Lights out at 2200 hours.

10 PM?

I mean, are we in elementary
school?

Okay!

The mattress is shit.

The view's shit.

On your daddy's yacht?

Name's Nigel.
Greg.

Rob.

You guys look like first timers.

Is it that obvious?

Me, on the other hand.

The resume speaks for itself.

Holy shit!

All in the name of science.

Right. That's enough about me.

Sweet.

Cameras. Note the cameras.

You see, the powers that be have

So, quite simply, we are
monitored.

24/7, seriously.

C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.

This thing is being a bit of
a pesterance.

So this is it. Next stop.

Med wing.

This is it. This is where
you gotta be.

do the skin scratchy bullocks.

Take a look, just down there.

That leads to the lab
downstairs.

Do all their dirty work.

[Skipped item nr. 139]

There's more! There's more!
C'mon! C'mon!

It's a run over.

You see? They call it a run over.

But the problem was, after about
a week,

everyone started getting the...

The shakes, the twitches.

But they leave shaking so
bloody much,

they can't even zip up their
own fly.

You've gotta love it.

Oh, hey hey. What's up with...

What's up with that guy?

Must be the placebo.

But just dosing him with like,
the...

The sugar water.

It's a fake. A fuckin' phoney.

A phoney, phoney pony!

Nono no no no.

The group is small. Can't
afford it.

Can't afford to waste one
of us. Nope.

Then again,

Nono no no no.

It's all a test. All a test.

See...

Alright.
Thanks a lot.

Well, he's kind of a wacko.

That was interesting.
Yeah.

To say the least.

Hello ladies. Lovely day.


The boys, the boys! The lads,
the lads!

Welcome to your last supper.

Rob and Greg, meet Linnea
the beautiful.

Hi.

Forks?

What do you need forks for?
It's pizza.

Lemme getcha.

Here ya go.
Oh. Thanks.

You're welcome.

Is food really gonna be that

It's revolting.
Oh God! Not again.

Okay.

Makes me what? Less of a man,
right?

Okay. Here's the little piggy's

Here's the little piggy's lips.

Like an old married couple, huh?

Okay. Great.

Hey. Cool ink, man.

Buthe informed me he's a

Thanks to our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

Amen.

Yeah. Amen. Totally.

We do not belong here.

Does toothpaste expire?

Cause this shit is fuckin'
terrible.

Dude I am fuckin' serious,
Greg. Okay?

We don't belong here.

Plus, that blonde chick.

She was eye fuckin' me the
whole time.

Dude, is sex all you think
about?

Yeah? Don't you?

Yeah. All the time, man.

All the time.

(Unidentifiable Shrieking)

Dude, what the fuck was that?

Sounded like two animals...

...like, going at it.


Back off!
Backing off.

Sup?

What is going on here?

This guy attacked me.

Aaron is our lab technician.

May he continue?

Hey Rob, it's just a needle.

Stop being such a pussy.

Okay.

I'll help you.

Interesting.

Not good.

Oh. Here we go.

Ah!

Sorry.

Man up, dude.

You're next.



Supmate.

She's watching.

What's up with all the bran?

It keeps everything moving.

In case the drug clogs you up.

Those eyes, they're watching.

What the hell? There's a hair
in my food.

Oh God, that is gross.

Gross? What are you talking
about?

It's natural. Even girls do it.

I don't.

Hello.

Do tell, do tell, do tell.

It's just chemistry. It's the...

But I'm really bad at science.

It's driving me crazy.

No! Rob-Rob could help you.

He's a...

...a whiz at chemistry.

He could tutor you.

Are you really?

Oh my God, yes.

Total prodigy, this kid.

He actually just got accepted
to...

...to MIT, for grad school.

Hey. Y'know, it was kinda...

He's a whiz at it

It's really not like that.

You got into MIT?
Yeah.

Boy Wonder, right here.

Okay. Well can you really help
me then?

It's kinda been a while.

He actually would love to.

He's the most helpful person

that I know.

Okay.

Fine. So maybe after lunch?

We can study?
Yeah. Sure.

I could try.


Hey, hey! I got it!

I got it. It's good.

Thanks.
Yeah.

That is not okay.


M I fucking T? Dude?
It worked, didn't it?

Yeah. But I'm not a fucking
genius.

Okay?

It's impossible.

You gotta roll with it. Done.

Gentlemen. Dosing room.

Remember to dress accordingly.

Accordingly?

This isn't so...
Stop it.

This really isn't...
Just stop it.

Just shut up.

We're just wearing dresses.

Just clam up, alright?

Don't cry, sweetheart.

Daddy has to do this.

I'll be home soon, sweetie.

Rob.

Yeah. That's me. Alright.

Go get em.

Temp.

(Machines beeping)

RXZ insertion at 10:21.

Run the IV rate at 150cc per
hour.

And be aware the drug may
feel...

Cold.

Up and down my arm.

You'll warm up shortly.

Okay.

Blood draws every 10 minutes.

Alright.

Hey doc.

Long time, no see.
Gregory.

You were a mermaid.

You were singing to me.

You had the voice of an angel.

RXZ-19 insertion at 11:21.

Run the IV rate at 150cc
per hour.

No, that's not my point. All
I'm saying is...

She makes me feel like a
naughty boy.

But she's... she's 60.

She's awesome

So you like the older women?

Hey, how'd it go?

Rob...
Rob.

I dunno. Do I detect a little
lover's tiff?

Has it all gone wrong?
Within these walls?

Has it pulled you apart?
Uh oh.

It's alright. He'll come about.

No.
Would that be a problem?

Where are you off to?

I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

I think that fiber just hit
my system.

Oh mate.

You've never had a mate like
this before.

Good luck.

Thanks.


It'll have to wait.

Greg. Hi.
Hey.

Did you just have a bowel
movement?

Yeah.

I did.
Great.

On a scale of 1 to 10,

1 being the easiest,

and 10 being the most difficult.

Okay. Yeah.

Let's say... 4.

Write down a 4.

4.

Okay.

In your own words,

Quality. Well, there wasn't
much quantity.

But the quality was good.

I've never had to...

...articulate this before.

Just try.

Well formed.

Solid.

Stringy.

No pain upon release, so...

Thumbs up.

I just wiped, and wiped.

How long?

I'm not gonna answer this.

Feel free to use a metaphor.

Like a thick oil.

Like a dirty oil.
Dirty oil.

Like hard?
Cloudy.

Not talking about it.

How about sound?

I just appreciate you helping
me so much.

Well hey, no problem.

I'm sorry. I just...

Thank you.
Piece of cake.

It's what I do.

Yeah. Alright see ya.
Okay bye.

So?

What?

Greg, alright. It's not like
that.

It was like a beautiful melding
of intellect.

You're not safe. Save yourself.
What?!

Everything. They get inside
your head.

Save yourself.

Save yourself! NO! NO!

LET ME GO!

LET ME GO! YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

NO!

LET ME GO!

NO!

Hey. What happened?

We found PCP in his blood.

He's a drug addict.

Except, of course,

the night before, they do that
one last hit,

just to say goodbye and then...

Hey Stacy. Crazy Stacy.

Rob.

You're bleeding.
What?

I'll finish up here, Patty.

Hey.

Everything okay?

Everything's fine.

Just be sure not to itch it.

And you'll be good as new.

What about me?

Doc, cause I have a...

I have a little cut here.

Y'know, it's a little...
Here's some antiseptic.

Okay.

Hey, Doctor Wilcox.

What's gonna happen to Ira?

Wesenthim down the road
to the ER.

The doctors there will take
good care of him.

Don't you think?

You guys have had a long night.

Get some sleep.



Hello, doctor.

Hello.

Today we're going to be
performing

scratch tests on your skin

to determine your baseline
allergic response.

Next, we take our allergen
samples from

core source material.

Oww.

Oh shit.


Fuckin' allergy medicine my ass.

(Growling and screaming)

Okay. It better not end up
online.

I was kidding.

Okay, so. You were attacked...

in the shower...

...by a rat?

Yes. By a giant fucking rat.

This thing was on like,
steroids and shit.

Something's not right here.

Something is fucked up.

What's up with all the tests?

I've just got a bad feeling
in my gut.

I'm just... I dunno. So...

Oh my God.

There's a worm in my food.

There's a worm in my food.

I've got a worm in my food!

Does anyone else have a problem?

Please. Check carefully.

I found one.

Me too.

One but... wait...

What the fuck is wrong with
this place?

I will report this to
Dr. Wilcox.

Empty your trays, please.

Oh, dude.

Does it flinch or anything?

What are you guys doing?

Looks like we found your rat.

Check out its scars. They are
so cool.

I wonder where it came from.

To every thing, there is a
season.

I think someone should tell
Aaron.

Time for your next doses,
not recreation.

C'mon.

I am thinking that it is... B.

B.

You are incorrect.
Damn it.

It's close, but not right.
What is it?

It's actually C.
Synthesis.

Oh God. Why is it so hard
for me?

Why is this so easy for you?

I wouldn't say easy.
No?

It's more like...

...practiced.

Yeah. Practiced.

That whole MIT thing.
That wasn't...

What?

I... I don't really go to MIT.

It's... it... the point is...

I've done internships, y'know.

Okay, well, at least all your
hard work is...

...coming into good use.

Well yeah, I guess.

It's not like that, no.
It's just...

I dunno. It's...

I've been okay with that,
y'know?

I've never really questioned it.

I dunno. It's weird.

For some reason,

now it's like I feel...

Like what?

I feel free.

Completely free.

Me too.

Me too.

Woo! Oh my God!


Let me.




What is that smell?


Who's been eating this?

Who has been eating this animal?

This is very dangerous.

A dead animal is full of
bacteria.

You need to tell me right now.

(Glass shattering)

Montell?

Someone help me.

Take him to the medical lab.

Hold him down.

Hold him down.

Alright, alright, alright.


Fuck me! He's got my hand.

Get him off! Get him off!

Fuck me!

Dr. Wilcox.

Immediately.

Dr. Wilcox says you should
get to sleep.

In the morning? You kidding me?

Can you believe this shit?

Greg. You heard her.

Go to sleep.



(Electronic beeping)






(Dogs barking)

(Barking gets louder)

(Angry hissing and barking)

Hello Gregory.
Okay...

I need you in my office
immediately.

You need to stay calm. Okay?

What's going on here?

What... What are you doing
to me?

We're not doing anything to you.

Don't you fuckin' mind fuck
me alright?

I wasn't hallucinating.

We can talk it over.

Just stay calm.

Stay back, alright?

Y'know what? Fine! HOLD ON!

Fine. Then I'm gonna show you.
Greg, don't!

You see this?

Fuck! You see that?

Nothing's gonna happen to me.

Catch him. He's gonna faint.

You see that? Nothing...

Greg...

Stop. Stop!

You're still woozy from the
anesthetic.

I'm the placebo.

Tell me, Greg.

What do you know about the
liver?

Like starfish in the ocean,

and under the right conditions,

regrow each piece to a perfect
whole.

This is a sample of normal
blood cells.

Take a look.

With ammonium hydroxide,

I'm going to erode the cell
walls.

That sample was from your body,
Greg.

And this...

...is from Nigel.

His cells are already infused
with RXZ-19.

Extraordinary, isn't it?

In all our testing,

I've never seen cells regenerate
so quickly.

Not even in our animal subjects.

Follow me.

This is Alexandra.

She won't win any beauty prizes,

but she's special in her own
rite.

Alexandra was our first animal
subject

to achieve 100% regeneration.

But with time,

we began to regrow muscle,

blood vessels,
even nerve tissue.

The heart, lungs, even the
brain.

It's only a matter of time.


What'd you do to her neck?

Our most recent success.

I personally severed her carotid
artery.

Quite the resilient one,
aren't you?

With Alexandra's regenerative
abilities,

came other changes.

She began to have more tolerance
for filth,

Have a seat.

Disgust had disappeared.

What do you mean "disgust"?

Or more importantly,
what purpose it serves.

The answer is rooted in our
survival, Greg.

protects us from bacteria.

keeps us from performing acts
that likewise

threaten the life of our
species.

the more hormones flooded into
her system,

It was too powerful for its
protections.

and then ate them.

First,

we must understand RXZ-19.

And then we must control it.

Yeah. Oh, I do. I do.

But first of all,
I just have to say one thing.

This is not what I signed
up for.

Greg, I can assure you.

You're completely safe.

And how about the others? Huh?

How are they gonna react?

That's what I thought.
You have no idea.

You have no right to fuck with
people.

That's very noble of you, Greg,

but they already know.

and how significant our work
here is.

Bullshit. This is a bunch
of crap, Rob.

Let's go.

Of course, if you choose to
leave now,

you will not receive payment
of any kind

as the terms of your contract
make clear.

There are conditions.

All of you will have to remain.

And in a study this sensitive,

You're fucking kidding me.

You guys are actually
considering this.

I'll do it.
Rob!

Lee and I are in.
Me too.

Fine. Y'know what?

I'm done playing guinea pig.

I don't think so.

Greg!

The doctors are here.
I don't care.

What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

Get off me.

Get your ass in there.

What the fuck? This is bullshit!

Now I'm just stuck in here?

What the hell is wrong with
you man?

Don't you see how dangerous
this is?

You have no idea what this
feels like, Greg.

I don't know.

Thanks, Rob.

Oh, and, she thinks it would
be a good idea

I'll do it.

(Computer beeping)


New message.

We're running on a time line.

Haven't heard from you.

And I don't like the sound
of it.

Call me.

Any bran left?


You gonna eat that?

No.

Hey guys. Look what I can do.


Oh my gosh!

Did that hurt?
A little.

I bet Benal could top that.
Top what?

What are you doing?

You do it, ya God damn pussy.

Whoa! Whoa!

May I have that, please?

Nigel's little incident
notwithstanding,

we're still a long way of
predicting

how effectively your bodies
can regenerate.

It's time for your next dose.

What wants to go first?






What are you doing?

God!

I've got nothing to say to you.

What are you doing here?



It's just sex.

Everybody does it.

You're right.


What the hell?

I'm not into that.
Shut up!

What the fuck is wrong -


What the fuck!

(Yelling and growling)

Get off of me.

Get the fuck outta here.

We're at a critical point.

Yes. I understand.


It's not in the protocols.

Protocols have changed.

(Machine beeping)

This may sting a little.

5.5 seconds.

Again.

3 seconds.

Again.

1 second.

That's enough.


Do you trust me?

Dr. Wilcox.

Dr. Wilcox, what are you doing?

Aaron get the suture!

(Beeping speeds up)

Stop! Stop.

What are you doing? You're
killing him!

Gimme another dose.

Do it!

(Beeping flatlines)

(Beeping stabilizes)


I was wondering when you'd
wake up.

You should be very proud of
yourself.

You've secured the future of
this project.

Rob?

Is everything okay?

STOP!

Rob! Stop!

Help!

Help me!

(Yelling and groaning)

Help!

Rob.

Help!

STOP!


(Groaning continues)

(Thunder rolls)

Y'know I believe in this,
doctor.

But without more security,
it's just not safe.

I know some guys that need work.

I could make a couple phone
calls.

No.

Dr. Wilcox, please.

We can't.

This experiment is sensitive.

If any of this became public-

Then I'm sorry. I quit.

This is not worth it.

You tell Ravexin to kiss my ass.

Technically, this isn't just
a Ravexin study.

It's more of a partnership.

And our employers are very...

...eager now, to see it
through.

How much is she paying you?

Same as I'm willing to pay you.

All of you.

Consider that an early bonus.

But I need you to finish this
with me.

Patty, please.

if not for the money,

then do it for science.

With all due respect,
Dr. Wilcox...

Fuck science.

I need a new car.


Hey Rob.

I have something for you.

It's gonna help you relax.

You can do whatever you want
to me.

It doesn't matter.

Nothing you can do tome
matters.

You'll never know what it
feels like.

Why would I lie to you?

I dunno. Why would you lie
tome?

I wouldn't.

So Taylor didn't tell you?

Well, I hope it's not gone.

You've gotta be shittin' me.

Right here?

In the facility?
That's right.

Taylor took it from me when
I checked in.

C'mon dawg. What do you have

C'mon.

I'm telling ya. It's up here.


Mmm, mmm, mmm.

What'd I tell you, dawg?

There ya go.

That's right. Liquor's liquor.

Oh yeah. Feel the burn.

Feel the burn.

Alright. Cool.

Yeah.

That's good.
Yeah.

Oh shit. Did you hear something?

What?

Put that away.

Oh man -

Oww Jesus. What the fuck!
Oh shit.

Ahh!

Oh fuck.

(Machine beeping)

I need everyone to listen to me.

Greg is trying to escape.

I'll give you more RXZ-19.


Greg! C'mere!

Hey! Stop!

Hey!

Hey!

Right here. Hey! Hey!


Stay down!

(Hard rock music)




(Yelling and groaning)

I said that's enough!



(Yelling and gunshot)

(More gunshots)

Jesus Christ, Benal!

You fuckin' shot me!
My bad.

You asshole.

You fuckin' asshole. I'm
gonna kill you!

Everybody, wait!


Is everyone else okay?

I'm... I'm okay...

Look. I'm...

I'm okay. I'm okay.

Look.

Lay down.

Lay down.

What the hell? She was shot?

He shot her.

(Machine beeping)

Keep the subject outside.

No one gets in here. Understand?
Yeah.

What's going on?

No exit wounds. What?!

The bullets,
they're lodged inside her.

We're gonna have to extract
them.

Her vitals are crashing.

(Beeping speeds up)

Here. Right here.

I can't get inside.

We're losing her.

I can't get inside!

Do something!
I can't get inside!

(Beeping flatlines)

FUCK!

Jesus.

Oh God.


We were unable...

Stacy...

I knew you two were close.

If there's anything you need,
just ask.

There is... one thing.

Of course. Anything.

You could...

...give us our dose now.

Like you promised.

What?

RXZ-19.

For finding Greg.

Remember?

The girl's right. A deal's
a deal.

A deal's a deal.

You promised.
We want it right now.

Okay! OKAY!

I'll give it to you. Yes.
Of course.

Yes. It's coming.

I'll just have Aaron...

...prepare it now.

Wait in the lounge, and...

We'll call you when it's ready.

Okay?

Okay.

Thanks.

It's coming.

Jolly good, jolly good,
jolly good...

I want the entire facility
locked down.

No one leaves.

Get the detox solution.

All of it.

No, Greg. Experiment's over.


(Thunder rolls and claps)


Are we ready?

Who do you want first?

My turn! My turn!
Real soon.

Patty, run the IV wide open.

I'm doubling the concentration.

We can't waste any time.

(Thunder rolls)

(Thunder rolls and claps)

Oh no.

Probably the storm overloaded
the circuit,

tripped the breaker.

Curtis, breaker's down.

Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

(Thunder rolling)


See, I told you. Nothing to
worry about.


Come on!

Hey!

Some one let me out!


(Beating on door)

This is gonna hurt.

Okay.




(Radio static)

Curtis! Curtis?

(Thunder rolling)

Is the detox working?

It's too early to tell.

Get the next subject ready.

We don't have much time.

(Thunder rolling)


Honey, what's wrong?

The others... they attacked me.

Honey, are you okay? C'mon.

I tried to stop them, but...

What'd you say, honey?




Not so fast, darling.


Where is it?
Where's what?

WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?


Anymore?

Anymore, doctor?

Anymore?

Doctor.

Doctor...

Don't be shy. Don't be shy.


(Thunder rolling)

(Thunder rolling)

(Thunder rolling)

Aaron!

Hey.

How do we get outta here?



My Jeep is this way! C'mon!

Where are ya going, Piggy?

Did you get my transmission?

I repeat, did you get my last
transmission?

That's affirmative.
What's your status?

Over and out.

Who are you working for, Aaron?

Who do you think paid for
RXZ-19?

They're gonna bury it.

All of it.

What's gonna happen to Rob,
Aaron?

What's gonna happen to Rob?

(Tires screeching)

You fuck!

Answer me, Aaron!
Okay.

ANSWER ME!
Okay.

They're gonna cover it up.

Okay? Don't be so fuckin' naive.

Jesus.

Turn around.

TURN AROUND!

Whatever you're thinking, don't.

Okay? These are not good people.

They don't fuck around.
DO IT!

If you're not back by-

Give me the keys, Aaron.



God damn.

Okay.

Okay. Hold on.

Nothing you can do...

There's gotta be some left.


They... used it all.

Maybe I deserve this.

I didn't want it to come
to this.


Tell him that if you get out.

Please.

(Inaudible communications)

Sir.

Is everyone still inside the
building?

Yes sir. As far as I know.

Has any outside contact
been made?

No sir. I'm certain of it.

What's your name?

It's... Aaron, sir.

Good work, Aaron.


Have your men ready to go
in five.

I've been waiting for you.





(Flesh packing)

(Gasping for breath)



(Metal clanging)

Rob.


Oh my God. Hey.

Listen. We gotta get outta here.

I thought it was all a dream.

It's real, isn't it? It's real?

Listen. That wasn't you.

Rob, go!

Okay? Alright, me and you.

Look at me. You and me.

There ya go.

Where's Linnea, Greg?
C'mon.

Greg, Where's Linnea?
Move, move.

(Metal clanging)

Is that my little piggy?

Piggy...

Come here, Piggy.

Piggy. Piggy, Piggy...

Piggy, Piggy, Piggy...

Piggy, Piggy...

Piggy?

Piggy, Piggy, Piggy, Piggy.






You shouldn't have done that,
mate.




Let's go.


Over here! NO!

(Automatic weapons firing)


(Beeping speeds up)

Run!

(Single beep)


Nothing but ashes in there now.

These buildings...

...with their faulty
electrical wiring.

Such a tragedy.

Oh yeah.




Thank you.

Thank you so much. Holy shit.

Oh my God.

Aaron!

Aaron.

Aaron. Take us to the police,
okay?

They killed everybody.

Everybody's fuckin' dead, man.

Can you take us? Please.


Do you have like a blanket?

Or something in your trunk?
Hold on.



Oh shit.


Thank you so much.

They can't get away with
this shit, Aaron.

Somebody has to know.

Nobody can know, Greg.

You can't stop them.

Yes. I can.

Good work.


Isn't the town back that way?

We're gonna take a small detour.

(Locks clicking)

It's complicated.
