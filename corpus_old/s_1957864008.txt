Bit of car trouble mate.

Hi. So whatâ€™s happened there?

My carâ€™s fickly.

Started smoking about
a mile down the roads.

The whole thingâ€™s just stopped me
when I fucking have to go anywhere.

Had a wee look saying thereâ€™s
just smoke pouring out everything.

It stopped new lake.

I cannot fucking do now.

If you need a ride I can take
you to the nearest servo.

Fucking yes.

Done again, Iâ€™ve got much to
offer you for your services like.

Itâ€™s alright mate.

Weâ€™ll think of something.

[Bag zip sound]

[Street noise sound] [Footsteps]

Here, here you are.
Have a good night.

Thank you, ma'am. God bless you.

[Street noise sound] [Footsteps]

[Car door opens]

Hi. Hi. How's your night going?

Good.

Oh, you don't need to
worry about that, Jessica.

Oh, well, that makes it easy.

Um, it's going good. I, you know,
just ran into a guy outside.

He asked for some money,
you know how it is.

Oh, I apologize. It's a
real problem around here.

It's no worries at all. I
always like helping him out.

Gave him some money.
You know, $20.

Well, that is very kind of you.

You can go ahead and have a seat.
They'll be starting shortly.


Okay, did you Mark her here?

It was Jessica.

Hi again.

Thank you for being here.

Of course. You know,
I love these things.

Can I see your ID please?

Oh, yeah. Of course.

Sorry. No, it's not.

What's the matter?

Oh, nothing. I just need
to update your information.

We had some issues
in our last video.

Oh, the address on there is old.
I haven't updated it in years.

Okay, look. I'm going
to level with you.

We don't get a ton of people
with your income level.

We have two tonight but they're
more interested in you than anybody.

Oh.

Try to make an impression
tonight. You know, stand out.

Don't I always. Of
course. Thank you.

Hmm.

You can go ahead and have a
seat. They're almost ready.


[Music plays in the background]

[Phone rings]

[Music plays in the background]

[Door opens]

I'm so sorry. The bus is late.

Can I see your ID please? Sure.

Okay. Thank you, Andy.

Take a seat. We'll be starting
very soon. Okay, thank you.


Hey.

Don't I know you? Nope.

[Music playing continuous]

I mean I don't I don't think so.

Cuz I swear. Iâ€¦ [Footsteps]

Okay. Hey, everyone.

My name is Aaron and I'm going to be
leading the discussion this evening.

First thing I gotta get you to
do is turn those cellphones off.

If you're afraid you can
get an emergency phone call,

you can leave your cellphones at the
front desk and they'll notify you.

Other than that, all
electronics have gotta be off.

Okay, we're good.
Phones are off.

Okay, let's head
back and we'll start.

[Music continues in the
background] [Footsteps]

Alright, good.

Great. Everyone
found their seats?

Perfect.

So, I'll introduce
myself real. [Man coughs]

Are we good? Alright, we good?

Yeah. Yeah.

Anyway,

I lead these discussions all around
the United States and the world

and companies hire me to be
a dispassionate listener.

Meaning, it's my job to get
unbiased information for

those companies to use when
creating their new products.

So guys, tonight, I
have no vested interest.

I'm not a cop.

I just want to better
understand your thought

process when purchasing
consumer products.

Make sense?
Yeah?

Yeah. Great.

Okay. So, let's get to
know you a bit better.

Let's get a conversation
going, shall we?

Let's start by just talking about what we
all do and what brings us together tonight.

Who wants to go first?

I'm cash.

Michelle, right?

Yeah.

Well, it's a great incentive certainly
but that's not the only reason, right?

Matthew, why are
you here tonight?

I'm a student.

You're a student?

Great. Okay. Um and
what are you studying?

Psychology?

Psychology.

Nice.

Okay. Wait. Anybody in the
room need to be evaluated?

Hey, whoa. Huh?

I'm kidding.

Kidding.

So, being a student
brings you here.

I mean, cash just like she said.

Told you.

Oh, okay. Fantastic.

Great. Um what
about you, Michael?

Is that thing on?

Oh, yeah. We record
all the sessions.

Oh, well, I don't think
I should tell them.

Oh, oh, it's just for
review purposes only. It's

internal. Don't worry,
completely confidential.

Okay, I want a boat.

Oh, that's interesting.
Um, what kind?

Big boat.

Oh, okay. Uh great. A big boat.

Now, let's see.

Uh Jessica, what do
you do for a living?

Uh I'm an attorney.

Really?

What firm?

Oh, it's a smaller firm.

Okay, great.

Which one?

I'm a partner. Oh, partner.

Okay, so what brings you here?

Well, honestly, I am here to maybe
field some potential clients.

Anybody here need
legal representation?

I think I might have something for
you. If you take government contract.

Well, a partner is
very impressive.

My mom's a partner. Which firm?

Blair and associates.
[Music playing continuous]

Anyway, how many
in your household?

Um my husband and my daughter.

Okay, good. Great.

Well, nice to meet you, Jessica.

Um who else haven't
we heard from tonight?

Uh Andy, what brings
you here tonight?

What? I'm sorry.
I wasâ€¦I was just

yeah. What do you do?

Um well, I work for a maid
service. We clean houses office.

How much longer is
this going to take?

I mean, can we just get
to the questionnaire

of whatever I work
in the morning?

Well, let's get to it then.

Thank you, Andy. Alright.

Michelle, what is
it that you do?

I'm a waitress.

Hold on a second.

Says here that you work
at the post office.

I used to.

I just started at this
new gig a week ago.

Well it's really important
that you specify.

They're very particular about the
occupations that you have here.

I didn't realize it was
going to be an issue.

[Door knock sound]
[Door open sound]

Uh one moment everybody.
Give me a sec here.


Sorry.

I'm just trying to place
where I know you from.

Can you help me out?

Uh...

Have you ever been
to Miller heights?

That's where I live.

I can't say I've
been there before.

Yeah, millionaires only.

Oh. Well, I grew up there.

Okay. How do we not
know each other?

You know, actually. Michelle,

can I have you grab your things
and meet me out here, please?

You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

Um okay.

Better be getting paid
for this bullshit.


[Door closes]

I apologize for that everybody.

They're very particular about the
occupations in regards to the study.

We need unbiased opinions.

[Message ring sound] Alright
let's continue shall we?

Uh now that we all
know each other.

What's the most important
factor to you when

purchasing let's say
an article clothing?

Jessica, we'll start with you.

What?

Oh, I would say quality.
[Music playing continuous]

And is price a big
factor for you.

Um, no, that's not
usually a problem for me.

Well, that's a nice
one for you to have.

So, when deciding to purchase a
good, the main thing to considerâ€¦

I'm sorry.

Am I the only person
that's hot in here.

Uh, yeah, it is still a little
hot, everybody else warm?

Yeah. Alright, you know, let me
just check on that real quick.


[Door open sound]

Hey, can we get the ac
turned on over here? I

am in a focus group. It's
like a freaking sauna.

[Music playing continuous]

Why do you keep looking
at me like that?

[Candy wrapper sound]
[Music playing continuous]

Oh. You don't even
know what's in there.

Okay. Jessica, can you hit me

you don't know me.

No, you don't.

I think I do. No. No.

Yeah. I don't. Just give me a
second. It's on the tip of my tongue.

It. Interâ€¦

inter Lewis. Just right here.

Bad news everyone. [Door closes]

We have no ac tonight. So, it's going
to be a little warmer than we thought

and I apologize for that. Sorry.

Anyway, Jessica, back to you.

What's the last thing that
you've purchased for yourself?

Well.

Probably this wallet.

That's a fake.

What?

No, it's how would you know?

[Scraping sound]

Hey. See?

Where did you buy
that? The mall.

Then you didn't check.

You got scammed then.
No, it's not a fake.

Hm.

[Phone rings] Hey, I
told your all phones off.

I'm so sorry. I am I
have to take this. It's

an emergency. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

[Phone rings] [Footsteps]

[Door closes and shuts]

I'll call you back
in a minute, okay?

Okay,


Are you leaving, Jessica?

Oh, I was just going to

you know that you have to wait
till the end to get the money.

Where's your bathroom? Okay.

Uh oh.

Down that, through
that door, to the left.

Thanks.

Yeah.


Big white bush.

[Water running]

[Phone rings]

What?

Okay, first off, I'm your brother.
Don't talk to me like that.

What do you need from
me right this minute?

Jessica, I need your rent
tonight. I am getting it now.

Since last monthâ€¦
I'm getting it. Now.

[Drop phone] [Water running]

[Music playing]

[Door open sound]
I bought a new hat.

Jessica, great to have
you back. [Footsteps]

Everything alright?

Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

My my son was acting
up with his tutor.

Okay. Well, glad it
was nothing dire.

Uh your phone? It's off now?

Great. Okay. Alright.

Well, it's good to hear.

Matthew, purchasing habits.

Well, with my non-existent
cash, I just save any way I can.

You know, ramen noodles
and shit like that.

Can I see your ID please?

Yeah. Of course.

Hey.

Do I know you? Nope.

I am just trying to place
where I know you from.

Particular about
the opportunity.

Okay. Jessica.

Now at your back,
what do you think?

What do I think about what?

Well, we're talking about splurging
on items outside your income.

[Music playing continuous]

What are you trying to say?

Well, since you're one of the
high-income respondents in the group,

do you ever hesitate when purchasing
things outside your financial obligations?

Sometimes, I suppose. I don't
know. I'm not made of money.

Okay, I mean.

[Music playing continuous]

[Man chews]

Oh

[chewing continues]
[Music playing continuous]

[Bottle crushing sound]

I got it.

Shut up.

Jessica, I need
you to calm down.

I I've never seen her
before in my life.

Please calm.

Long day?

Just trying to place

here? What are you trying to say?

I didn't realize it was
going to be an issue.

I got it. [Pen tapping]

Shut up. Jessica.

I've never seen her
before in my life.

Jessica. Jessica.

[Mug dropping]

[Music playing continuous]

[Music playing]

Thank you so much for coming with me.
Yeah, are you sure you're ready for this?

I mean, it was just a couple of days
ago. Someone has to do it, right?

Sure.


He's suing an ethics paper.

What do you mean?

[Hanging light sound]

That's due tomorrow.

Yeah, thatâ€™s right.

What? Iâ€™m sorry
if I have a life.

No, thatâ€™s not what I
meant. I just, you know.

We both know Iâ€™m going to end
up copying hers anyway so.

Alright.

What should I do with
this one? Whatâ€™s in it?

Uh perfume and stuff.

See if you can find
her black nail Polish.

She never went anywhere
without wearing it.

Your grandma wore
black nail Polish?

Gangster. [Plates clattering]

Not in this one.

Yeah, she was pretty amazing.

Should my grandma have friends
over for dinner every night?

Why?

Thought you said your
grandma was a terrible cook.

Never said terrible.

Thatâ€™s right. Itâ€™s a
vomit-inducing catastrophic.

You sure youâ€™re okay?

Yeah.

Um can you see whatâ€™s in
that chest right over there?

That one? Yeah.

[Woman drags &amp; opens chest]

Oh, hello.

[Music playing continuous]

Listen to this.

The one that reads it through
shall read it without an issue.

If your intent is to renew your
soul red is the path you shall go.

Your blood, flesh and bones shall
be fed with a piece of your own.

Once youâ€™ve started, there is no going back
for your body will only be alive with that.

Empty people for
a powerful soul.

That is the path youâ€™ve
now chosen to go.

Grandmaâ€™s poetry sucks.

[Closes chest]

[Woman coughs]

[Spoon drop sound]

[Bowl sliding sound]

The principle of morality,
could be reached by a standard

of rationality with our
own minds figuring it out.

He dubbed that a categorical imperative.
It had to be it was imperative.

Ladies, are we bothering you?


Emily, since you seem
to know all of this,

would you enlighten us with the
definition of morality please?

Morality is the
differentiation of intentions,

actions, decisions
between wrong and right.

Okay, on to the next.

Letâ€™s talk about right and wrong.
Who can give me a definition?

Thatâ€™s defined by your culture.

Yes, in some cases,
youâ€™re exactly right.

Uh ethics refers to rules
defined by an external source.

Whereas morality these
are the internal rules.

Ethically, it is
wrong to kill someone.

We all agree on that, right?

But letâ€™s say, letâ€™s
take it a step further.

Letâ€™s say your government
puts you into war.

Youâ€™ve got a gun.

The other guyâ€™s got a gun.

What are you going to do?

That is a moral dilemma
when you come face to face.

So,

[pen tapping]

Next class, Iâ€™d like you to
read chapters one through four

and weâ€™re going to talk about
this more deeply and just for fun,

bring in your own personal
example of a moral dilemma.

Okay? Thank you.
Class dismissed.

[Music playing continuous]

So whatâ€™s your
big moral dilemma?

I donâ€™t know. What choice?

What happened to likeâ€¦
oh are you are you okay?

Yeah. Iâ€™m going to go to the
bathroom. Can you watch my stuff?

[paper flipping] [Music
playing continuous]

[Dial tone]

Hello.

[Hanging light off sound]

I donâ€™t get it.

I really am sorry that happened to
you but you canâ€™t change it now.

How is it possible that I did a
ritual without even knowing it?

You read the book and
you put on the pendant.

Thereâ€™s gotta be another way.
It canâ€™t be that simple. I mean.

There isnâ€™t.

The transition only happens
after you have tasted.

[Music playing continuous]

Thereâ€™s no point in
trying to hide it.

We are the same now.

You can trust me.

What do I do now?

Youâ€™re getting
weaker by the day.

You need to eat. I canâ€™t.

You canâ€™t eat what youâ€™re used to. You need
flesh to survive and it has to be fresh.

Youâ€™re insane.

Why would anyone
choose this life?

I know this wasnâ€™t your choice
but as I said, you need to eat.

Now, itâ€™s kill or be killed.

You want to go get
something to eat?

Iâ€™m not hungry.

Come on, you can pick the place.

I said no.

Jesus, Iâ€™m just worried about
you. Why are you attacking me?

Trust me. Iâ€™m not.

Yeah, but I donâ€™t.
Just leave me alone.

Now, youâ€™re turning into a real bitch
lately. Not the Emily I used to know.

[Door closes]

[Pen drop sound]

[Music playing continuous]

Emily. Are you okay? Iâ€™m just...

Do you want me to
call the nurse?

[Music playing continuous]

Are you alright?

No. Iâ€™m Iâ€™m...

Iâ€™m so sorry.

How long have you guys

Well, my parents have lived all over
the place but this is a vacation home.

Theyâ€™ve had it for a while.

My sister and I havenâ€™t
visited them for years.

Years? What happened? Do you
guys get in a fight or something?

No, no, of course not.

We just all have our
own lives, I guess.

Sarah, how many this time?

Detective Hayes, I think that
youâ€™re working the cases anymore.

I am, fine. What we got?

One child, male,
approximately 7 months.

Cause of death looks
like strangulation.

The body is in advance decay. I think
itâ€™s been here about four to five weeks.

We found the body.

Some local children.

Anything is the body has the same markings
as the other bodies that have been found.

Alright, finish up here.

Take the body to the
coroner and get it analyzed.

Iâ€™ll meet you there.

John, good to see you back.

Evening.

Iâ€™m detective John Hayes cid.

Iâ€™ve been assigned your case.

[Man puts tape in VCR]

So, you are David
Hughes, is that correct?

Yeah.

Time is 11:26 pm on June the
ninth two thousand and sixteen.

So, from what Iâ€™ve
been made aware,

your wife and missus Anya
Hughes went missing from

your home in Redding last
night, is that correct?

Yes.

Okay, I need you to tell me everything
that happened starting from the beginning.

Iâ€™ve just told the other
police officer everything.

I donâ€™t understand. You
havenâ€™t told me, have you?

Is there any reason you can think
of why Arnie would want to leave?

Any recent argument?

No.

I already told
the other officer.

When I woke up, she
was already gone.

There was no note, all of her
stuff was still in the house.

There was no reason
for her to leave.

[Music playing] [Raining
sound continuous]

Where did you get that bracelet?

Oh,

sister Claire gave
them to me and my wife.

Said it was like a symbol of
starting a new life or something.

Whoâ€™s sister Claire?

Uh sheâ€™s a member of
my wifeâ€™s congregation.

Liam met about a year ago.

Um they became pretty close.

Whenâ€™s the last time you were
your wifeâ€™s sources declare?

Yesterday, she was over the
house before we went to bed.

Why is she at your house?

About a week ago,
Annie was telling me

she had been hearing things and s eeing
things in the house that werenâ€™t there.

I just thought it was a
bit of stress you know.

Weâ€™d only moved into
the house recently.

And this time of year
is itâ€™s difficult for us

about five years ago our
daughter went missing

Had a pretty big
effect on both of us.

[Music playing continuous]

Anyway, she called sister
Claire and sister Claire

came over to reassure her
and to bless the house.

What time did sister Claire
arrive at your house?

It must have been
after 10, maybe 10:30.

Yeah, about 10:30.

I let her in, told her
to make herself at home.

And you was upstairs.

Sheâ€™d been in bed all day.

So I went up stairs to tell
her sister Claire had arrived.

Obviously, itâ€™s been a difficult
time for Annie and well,

I know sheâ€™d appreciate
you being here.

[Music playing continuous]

Sister Claire.

Is everything alright?

Yes, I was just admiring
your beautiful mirror.

Itâ€™s actually a family heirloom.

I believe that originally
belonged to my grandmother.

And youâ€™ve always loved it.

After my my mom passed away last year.
We brought it with us to the new house.

At least youâ€™ll find
somewhere to put it up now.

Well, itâ€™s very beautiful.

My grandmother had a bohemus of a mirror
right in the center of her hallway.

Really?

Yeah, she was obsessed with it.

She used to just
stand there reticent.

She used to look past her
reflection as if she was waiting.

Waiting for what?

Claire.

Thanks for coming.

[Drop glass sound]

Honey, my dear, how
are you feeling?

Iâ€™ve been better,
not going to lie.

Look, I think we should
now bless the house.

It will put your mind at rest.

Iâ€™d like that.

[Music playing]

And bless this house oh lord.

Give it your protection
for this couple who are

starting a new chapter of
their lives together here.

May your love bring
happiness and joy.

Amen

[music playing]

Thank you for that.

I really appreciate you coming
here and on such short notice.

Of course, my dear.

Well, my work here is done.
I must go. Itâ€™s getting late.

Sorry, before you leave.

Can I just check there
wasnâ€™t something here?

Iâ€™m sorry.

I just feel more comfortable
knowing I wasnâ€™t crazy.

Look.

There is nothing to fear.

The miracle that is inside you
is his instrument for change.

And the world will
be blessed by it.

[Music playing continuous]

When you witness it.

Donâ€™t worry my dear.

Everything will
reveal itself in time.

[Music playing continuous]

Thank you dear.

I almost forgot.

I made these white
bracelets for you.

They represent a new life.

A new start.

Thank you, sister.

Right, we best be
letting you get on then.

Alright.

See you Sunday.

[Music playing continuous]

[Unlock door]

See?

Nothing to worry about.

We got each other, yeah?

Yeah.

Like sister Claire said, this
house is a fresh start for us.

[Kissing sound]

Iâ€™m going to head up, okay?

Yeah. Iâ€™ll switch
everything off.

Is that the last time
you saw your wife?

Yes. [Door knock sound]

[Door open sound]

Look, I donâ€™t even understand
how she couldâ€™ve left the house.

The keys were on the hook, all of
the doors and windows were locked.

I checked the entire house.

Do you recognize
any of these people?

Look, I just want
to find my wife.

Do you recognize
any of these people?

No.

Take a closer look.

Alright.

[Music playing]

Sister Claire.

You sure?

Yeah.

Youâ€™re absolutely
sure thatâ€™s her.

Itâ€™s definitely her.

That photo was given
to us 2 years ago.

Sheâ€™s someone of high interest in
a number of missing personâ€™s cases.

Wait.

Youâ€™re telling me she
isnâ€™t even a real nun.

If that wasnâ€™t the woman
at your house then no.

Her and some others are involved
in a series of copycat killings.

[Music playing continuous]

Thereâ€™s no way. Itâ€™s a mistake.

The case has all the
similar aspects to it.

Itâ€™s a mistake.

This case has all the
similar aspects to it

but thereâ€™s one thing
that does not make sense.

In all the other cases,

it was a child
that been missing.

So,

Iâ€™m trying to understand
why your wife has vanished.

[Music playing continuous]

She was pregnant.

She was only six or
seven weeks pregnant.

Did sister Claire know?

[Music playing continuous]

Iâ€™ll be right back, okay?

Wait.

What?

Whereâ€™s my wife?

[Door opens]

[Rain falls in the distance]

The ogres.

A fearsome and wicked entity

that serves the darkest of evil

feeding on the
young and innocent

with one single
objective to become human

only that from which is born pure can
this entity enter the realm of man.

One face.

Hi,

Are you really just
calling me for that?

Look, I need to know.

My sister Angela is
coming by this week and I

donâ€™t want her to see
your stuff in the house.

Youâ€™re acting like this
crapâ€™s not a killer.

[Knock on the door]

Could you hold on for a second?

[Door closes]

[Music playing continuous]

Lucy, look,

Iâ€™ll get my stuff when
I get my stuff and

please donâ€™t call me at
work anymore, alright?

Just not the best time.

You know what?

Iâ€™m just going to put your
stuff on the front porch, okay?

Goodbye, Lucy.

Hey, look.

I donâ€™t need my desk clean.

I donâ€™t need the windows washed.

I donâ€™t need the trash taken out.
Just leave me the hell alone.

Oh. Did I come at a bad time?

Don, sorry.

[Door closes]

What you need dude?

Nothing.

Just checking on
you before I leave.

[Typing continues]

Itâ€™s seven oâ€™clock. Donâ€™t
you have a few more hours?

I told Scott Iâ€™ll finish the Peterson
count first thing tomorrow morning.

Let me see.

So whoâ€™s flowers?

They are for my mom.

Sheâ€™s at the hospital, remember?

Oh, right. I am so
sorry. Hey, how is she?

Well,

open heart surgery was a success but
sheâ€™s currently at the icu right now.

Oh man.

Again, I I am so sorry. Hey, tell
her to get well for me, alright?

Will do.

Oh, I forgot to
tell you something.

So, I have two tickets to the usc versus
clemson basketball game this Friday.

Wanna go?

Sorry, man. I canâ€™t.

But you love the gamecocks.

You wouldnâ€™t miss
it for the world.

Well, Iâ€™m going
to miss this one.

I need to get these taxes done by the
end of the week and on top of that,

I mean my divorced
attorney on Friday.

Didnâ€™t I mention this
last night to you?

Damn.

Thatâ€™s why you did tell me that.

Howâ€™s things between
you and Lucy?

[Music playing]

You really want to know?

That bad? Iâ€™m really sorry. I wish
there was something I could do.

Donâ€™t worry about it.

Well, I guess some things
are just not meant to be.

[Music playing
continuous] [Chair creaks]

playing continuous]

You know, itâ€™s funny.

Have you been married to the love
of your life for over four years?

You start to think to
yourself, everythingâ€™s alright.

Everythingâ€™s perfect.

[Music plays in the background]

That is until one day
she walks up to you,

looks you straight in the eyes and
says, I donâ€™t love you anymore.

[Music playing continuous]

Thatâ€™s when it clicks.

[Music playing continuous]

Sheâ€™s seeing someone.

Do you have a place to stay?

Hey,

if you need somebody to
talk to, just let me know.

Look, I appreciate what youâ€™re trying
to do but I I donâ€™t need your help, man.

Just I want to get the
shit done and over with.

Understand.

I gotta get going.

Iâ€™ll see you tomorrow.

Yeah, you take care.

[Music playing]

Long night, huh?

[Music playing]

You donâ€™t have to say anything.

I can tell by the look
of your eyes, son.

Working nearly 80 hours a week tired,
frustrated by your boss and colleagues?

Going home every
night expecting dinner

complaining over small things that get your
wife irritated and started a big argument.

Youâ€™re the real mvp.

What the hell are you
even talking about?

First off, youâ€™re the
janitor, not my therapist.

Do you even know me?

I donâ€™t need to.

Iâ€™ve seen it all happen before.

Yeah right.

You need to be careful my son.

Oh, of what?

Yourself.

A wise man once said,

a relationship is like a house.

If a light bulb burns out,

you donâ€™t go out and
get another house.

You fix the light.

Otherwise, youâ€™ll
be in the dark.

Remember that.

Yeah sure. [Bell dings]

Well, thereâ€™s my stop.

You have a good
evening, mister mccray.

Iâ€™ll be seeing you again.

[Music playing]
[Street noise sound]


Hi. This is Lucy.

I am unavailable to take
your call right now.

But if you leave a message, I
will get back as soon as I can.

Love you. Mean it.

So,

Yep. This is their house.

The man went mentally insane.

He shot his wife,

the dude she was sleeping with,

and killed himself.

Damn.

Here you hear me?

Thatâ€™s crazy, man.

Nope. Thatâ€™s it for today.

Oh I thought you wanted
me to say something at

the end of the compilation
or in between shorts.

I prepared some lines. I.

Nope. Thatâ€™s it.
Itâ€™s a wrap hahaha.

Ah. Finally.

I was dying in that mask. Ugh.

Okay. Well, see you next time.
