But if you get scared, I want you to call me.

This is my number.
Will you do that? Good.

Oh, uh.... Don't forget to chain the Door.

Thank you.

You're wellcome.

Morbid sensation, not unpleasant.
someone there, I call out his name, "Billy!"

And who is Billy, Angie?

There is no Billy.
No Billy!  I don't know Billy!

Quit. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

What's new with me?

You'll be fine. you can sit up.
There's nothing we didn't know before.

We're not getting anywhere with this.
I'm leaving.

All right. Let's talk about repression.

Cliche.

Purpose of repression is the 
avoidance of pain.

This is accomplished by withdraw 
form objectionable ideas.

These ideas aren't dead or nonexistent,
but merely out of sight for the time being.

Why you don't tell me something
that isn't a cliche?

Right, right, all cliche. but the fact remains
something happened to you in your childhood

That your mind finds intolerable and 
has been denied conscious remembramce.

Look, I don't know what this has to do with me now.
I am 36 years old. 

All my friends are married and have children.
I've never even been...

Laid.

Come on. Say the word. 
You won't be punished.

Ah Yeah sure, say the word.
It just opens some magic door to love.

My first sexual experience was with some guy
who followed me into an elevator, threw me 
on the ground, and said "spread them."
That what I ....

Is that what sex is going to be for me?

No, of course not, Angie.

You know the difference between 
sex and sexual violation.

Let's examine the positive side
of what happened.

In the face of real danger, you managed to 
control the situation. Defended yorself. it's
a very important insight.

I want never to see that... bearded man again.

Your fears are perfectly normal, Angie.

That's funny.

What?

I'm perfectly normal.

What's the chance of your getting
an assignment today?

Oh, I don't want to work.

Keeping yourself busy is the best therapy.

I really think you should go to the agency.

See you next time.

Hi, Sweetheart.

I left my briefcase with my speech in it.
I'w due at the station in 15 minutes.

Hey, listen.
I've got an idea.

Why not stay home and play with me instaed?
Forget about politics for a day.

Really? Stephan, 
You in the middle of the day?

See you later my little satyr.

Ok. 477 Madoson, Third Floor.
See Donna.  You'll be fine.

OK. take care.

Hi, Bob. got anything for me today?

Hi, Angie. No sorry.

I want to work.

Sure. maybe tomorrow. In fact, I think there
 is a job coming up tomorrow..
If it happens, I'll call you.

Who is it?

Alex Morgan. Your neighbor.

I'm sorry.
I'm really busy right now.

We're having a few people over.
We've run out of ice.

Come in.

Feeling better?

Still... shaky, I guess.
Still looking over my shoulder.

Why don't you come join us?

I promise I won't let anybody to you but me.

I like to talk to people.
Infact I don't mind talking to people at all.

Good. come on by.

We'll see.

Thanks.

You're always be hungry.

What's that one?

90% butterfat, Terrible for your skin.

Thanks.

Well... Look who's here.

It's a good thing, The guy on the elevator
Didn't see her looking like that.

Oh, She's the girl who was attacked.

That's her. beautiful, huh?
Thanks for coming.

I thought you ran out of ice.

Well, it got you here. that's what counts.
Here, let me introduce you.

Miss Anderson, you're very hot tonight.

Angie Anderson, Nancy Leahy.

I heard about what happened to you.
It must have been awful.

You really can't trust this city or its people.
If it weren't for my business, I'd never come into it.

Nancy's an interior decorator.
A creator.

She just bought one of my paintings.
for a penthouse she's working on.

Alex, Darling would you make a favor for me?
walk me to the elevator? 

Good-bye, Miss Anderson. 
be sure to take care of yourself.

They used to be make quite a pair.

Almost seemed like it might go the distane,
till Alex cooled in her.

Left her holding a big tourch.
Poor little nancy.

You paint?

Yes, I do.
Come on. I'll show you.

Something Wrong?

No, They're Beautiful.

The Girls come and pose fore me
several time a week.

They're Good.
Is this the one you're working on now?

Can I uncover it?

That's the one I want you to see.

How did you do that?

Part imagination, part espinage,

And the fact that you're very
Careless with your blinds.

Why?

Because you fascinate me.

I'm going.

Don't!  you can't hate the painting.
It's you, isn't it?

Angela, I know more about you than your 
therapist or Alex will never know. Stop!

What do you want from me?

You.

You don't even know me.

I've known you for months,
I've watched you. I know you intimately.

Don't let this porsche I'm in fool you.
I'm still a man. ask them.

You're a virgin, aren't you?

Angela! Angela, come back! come back.

Oh, My God, Alex! It's him! 
Alex! Alex! Alex!

It's him. it's the man from the elevator.
That man with the red beard.

Take it easy.
Just take it easy. frank, come here.

Angie, this is frank brady.
He's an actor on the soap.

Hi, pleased to meet you.

Oh, My God!

It's all right.

Come in. please.
Please?

I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

You didn't.
Don't worry about it.

I want to talk to you about your brother.
He's driving me crazy.

Yeah. He's good at that.

How long has he been in the chair?

About a year.

We were driving back from the gape.
I was driving. there was an accident. that what I can say.

I've had in all kinds of specialists.
and did the best I can.

It's amazing.

what?

You're identical, but you're so different.

Yeah. We've always been different.
Cole was always the smart one...the genius with no ambition,

Never wanting to settle down till the accident made him.

Don't blame yourself. it's not your fault.

Can I ask you a question?

Would you dinner with me tommorow?
No

Lunch?
No

Breakfast?
No

A hotdog in a park?
No

Why do you want to be with me?
Because I like you. Because I've seen your dolls.

And you take broken things, and you make them beautiful.

Please. I can't stand to be touched.
I can't make love with a man.

You are not a lesbian? 
Why you make him think you are a whore?

It was an easy out at the moment.
Anyway, It got rid of him.

And that's what you really wanted?

I don't know. He's really nice, 
He's fun, He's handsome.

For some reason, he keeps 
coming on to me. but I stop it.

I want him to touch me, but I stop it.

So you see, Angie, Repressed thought it 
maybe you possess a sexual instict.

Do you possess a sexual instict?

Certainly. of course I do. 

How do you know?

How can I help knowing it?
If I see a pretty girl, I want to kiss her.

I findle her, I desire intercourse. 
If I don't have it at regular intervals, 

I'll find myself thinking sexual thoughts
and craving sexual satisfaction.

And you, Angie, are no different than me.

Save for a few mental barriers, we're the same.

I'd like you to touch me.

That's because you know nothing will happen.
You trust that, therefore you trust me.

I think I'm attracted to you, and that frightens me.

Why?
Because you're married.

Who frightened you the most, Angie? 
Me or my wife? Or is it Alex Morgan...

I told you that.
...or his crippled brother?

He scares the hell out of me.

Or ass-pinching Mr. Kramer? Or is it Billy?
There is no Billy.

But You told me there was! so I payback the tapes?

Come on Angie! You talk about this billy
but not what or who he is... she is!

Is Billy a woman, Angie?
No

How can you be so sure?
Because I know.

Because Why? Comon on Angie, do the work! 
Why?  Why?

Because woman don't have red beards !

I thought I told you... all right put her on.

Ann, Dear , I'm with a patient.
Three days? of course I'll miss you.

That's the price I pay for being marrid to a politician.
Yes. I'll be sure to watch you on television.

I'll tape it, I promise.

Sorry Angie.

Do you really are happy, aren't you?

Reasonably.

You don't have any children, do you?

You see, it's never perfect, Angie.
Never.

How about us doing it here, bitch?
We can do it right here. what you say?

What'll it be, Miss? what  can I get you, lady?
Water?

Anything else? 
Anything else?

Was dark in the movie house Angie.
How could you be sure that it was the same man?

Because I felt the scissors at my face.
Why didn't you call a policeman?

All I could think to do was to run.
I left, I ran out, and I called you.

I wasn't there. If you really certain that the man
return back, you should have called a policeman.

It would have been logical to do.

I thought you don't believe me.

I do believe you.
But also believe that are many red-bearded 
men living in the city and.....

Some go to the movies and try 
making out with pretty girls.

Why you've hanging up Angie? 
I'm trying to help you. do you understand me?

Your experience in the elevator was traumatic.
I Don't underestimate the shock of that encounter.

But it can't become an obsession.

I want you think about it is possible 
that your own panic is attracting these encounters.

I don't understand.

We'll talk about it.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

Angie, all right?

Hi, Sweetie.

He's kissing her... Long sensuous kisses
while he fondles her tits.

If this develops into something.
You just might end up on the street.

Don't worry. that's not going to happen.

What if Alex was to walk in that door
and see you standing?

I'd get down on my knees, and I'd cry "It's a miracle!
It's a goddamn miracle !"

What's the matter?

I can't do this. I'm no good at this.

It was me. I was just too eager.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Can we have that dinner tomorrow night?

Angela. Angela. I'm coming over.
I'm coming to see you.

911 emergency. How can I help you?

Here I come, Angela. We got to talk.

Cole, don't. don't be stupid.

Leaving the blinds open was stupid.

Please Cole. Come down.

Angie, this is Bob. You got a job for tomorrow.
Write this down:

"Richard Bailey. 434 West 23rd Street."
It's 2:00 O'clock.

2:00 O'clock. 
OK, Thank you.

That was a close call, huh? we got a job!

Hello?  Anybody here?

It's a sort of Fun being bigger than the city,
Isn't it?

People say that it's an ugly city,
But it's not.

It's provocative and challenging.

Those flagged buildings scattee thrushcut
the area... 

They're my buildings, and hopefully one day,
the whole city will look like that.

By buildings are conceived to filter cut dirt.
and sound from the outside.

You never get fading rays of the sun 
will never ruin your furnature.

Our polarized windows that can turn night into day
are designed so that the rooms never heat up.

But maintain a Liveable temperature and protect
you from the eyes of curious neighbors.

And if day is bleak outside, 

Your mood is automatically buoyl by
our lighting sensors... Watch.

Or if it's a mello, contemplative mood you desire,
Watch again.

And what's even more beautiful...
Just listen a moment. 

Silence. Yes blessed silence, whale outside,
the city surges and pulsates with shattering sound.

The Sanity and the health of this city

Depends on the evolition of 
just this kind of building.

Yes, You are now standing in a Richard Baily Apartment,
Designed to save our city and you.

You seen Angie?
No, why?

After spending half your time playing peeping tom,
I thouth you may could give me a report on her.

You want know about her,
Go knock on her door.

I did. All I hear is the cat. Cat's been yelling all day.
Angie doesn't answer.

What do you want from me?
maybe she left town.

She would bever left the cat.

How do you know what a psychologically
disturbed person would do?

Beside we had a dinner date.

Oh! of course. I'm sorry. who stands up a star?

I'm thirsty. I want bobbie.
I sleepy. I want sleep in bed.

My name is Betty. what's your name?
Angie.

Angie. that's a pretty name.

Look for the bird.
What bird?

Where is the bird?

Yes, of course it is. of course it's here.
Of course it's in the bedroom.

You killed him!
You killed him!

Voila. The mystery's solved.
She left town for a few days.

This doesn't make any sense.
Why would she send me a telegram?

Why she didn't pickup the phone and call me?
She doesn't say anything about feed it.

I'm sure she laid out plenty of food.

Then why is it crying?

All things cry and make a fuss
when they're lonely.

Didn't you know that?

Angie, You in there?

Now we'll go home.

Something's going on up there.

Mind your own business.
Mind your own business. Come on.

She had the lock changed.
I didn't get a key from her.

Then break the door down.

Your brother said she sent a telegram.

I don't care. She wouldn't leave her cat like that.

I can't break the door. it's against the law.
Sorry, I only work here.

You're really making a big thing out of this.

The card I left for Angie, it's gone.
It was under her door. someone took it.

Well, maybe the cat took it.

I think you took it.

Alex, This is your TV sense of reality talking.

Wait a second, Cole! What happening to us?
Where's all this anger coming from?

Are we enemies? Do you hate me?

I suppose you're going to tell me you love me.

Your're my brother. and I care for you.

All you care about is your next-door 
neighbor and her Goddamn cat.

I'm worried about her. 

I'm not. Her telegram's 
all the explanation I need.

I guess that makes me some kind of nut.

Isn't it going to get crowded in here?

Nancy... Alex just left.
He's gone looking for the girl.

well, I wish him luck.
It's a big bleeding city out there.

And there is no problem in this great city
that cannot be solved.

If we just have the patience, willingness, 
and energy to set about doing it.

We are in the center of fashion...

Just a moment, please.

Dr. Carter, this is Alex Morgan.
Angie's friend. yes Mr. Morgan?

I'm sorry I called so early.

That's all right. I'm an early riser.
What can do I for You?

Angie left town and I got a telegram from her,

Yes. I received a similar telegram.

She left her cat without food?

That is unusual.
She mentioned something about Tulsa.

Do you have her Tulsa address?

No
Or number? Does she have a family?

Mr. Morgan, I frankly doubt that Angie
come from Tulsa at all.

Dead mother and father, Rich legacy... I believe
it all to be a contrived fantasy background.

Angie's a very sick girl.

Sick enough to leave the cat she loves 
so much to starve to death?

I don't buy that, Doctor.

Maybe you should call the police.

I'm going to.
Thank you very much.

What are you doing out there?
Eavesdropping?

What are you doing in here?

There's a law against breaking and entering.
Didn't you know?

What you want?

I lived in your shadow long enough.
I want my dignity, Alex.
You took it away a long time ago.

I'm taking it back.

You bastard. You sold your 
life for a Goddamn handout.

You son of a bitch!

Right ! The son of the same bitch who bore you,
Greased your way with her slimy love,

Made it all so easy for you... who opened the
doors to all the good things in life

And spared you all its sick little whores.

You right brother. We're sons of 
the biggest bitch who ever lived.

Don't worry about me. I don't need you 
anymore. I don't need anybody.

I can make it on my own.
But you, Alex...

You're in terrible trouble.
Your audience left at intermission.

Me. Nancy, that little piece that lives here...
We're all out of your life now.

What's that suppose to mean?
Just what I'm saying.

I feel like taking a whole botlle of sleeping pills.
Jim certainly would be happier, and so would Madge.


After a decent interval of mourning,
they could marry.

Well, It's the perfect solution, isn't it?
It's time to go to work.

Dr. Carter.
Dr. Carter, I need to talk to you.

I want to buy a doll.

Angie, no, Put down the scissors.
Don't kill me, Angie!

Don't kill me, Angie Please.

I didn't. I didn't kill you. I didn't.

Where? where? where?
Oh You're gone.

This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy went home.

This little piggy had rosty beef,
This little piggy had home.

And this little piggy...
All the way home.

Ugly! ugly! ugly!

What are you doing here?
Where's Richard?

Where you usually find him. in the bedroom.

You killed him.

Yes. Two days ago with a pair of scissors.
I used to watch you come here for months.

I had a key made from the 
one I found in your bag.

One night I even dared to come in and listen to
you making love. You sounded fulfilled.

Why?
Morbid jealousy.

You killed him because...
I was seeing him?

For seeing him? No!
For screwing him, yes.

You're crazy.
Absolutely

The phone doesn't work.

You won't get away with this.
I'll going to the police.

No, You won't.

You're much too ambitious to risk at all that
your political career,

Everything for both of us, Down the drain.

You're pretty good at getting 
into people's heads, aren't you?

Top of the class at berkeley.

It's not going to work.
They're gonna to find you.

No darling. They'll find her.

I know her, She's one of your patients.

Positive Schizophrenic, Complex Father Fixation,
Repressed sexuality...

All of wich makes her a perdect
foil for this little drama.

But she'll go to the police.
She knows the truth.

Does she? I think she'll be this way for
long long time.

What is she doing?

She's keeping house for her stepfather...
in there. Transference is total.

Angie finally found her ignorant Billy.

I learned through hypnosis that her incestuous
stepfather sprted a red beard

and was murdered by Angie's mother
with the pairs of scissors. 

It's amazing... red beard, a few sound efects, 
some screws and bolts... a little production...

And Angie just slipped through the looking glass.

Your boyfriend's genius provided
the perfect theater.

Even the bird cooperated.

Memorized his lines like a trouper.

I love you, Ann. The past is out the way.
We can go on.

I'm willing to continue our life together.
Are you willing, Ann?

And pretend none of this happened?

No, I want you to remember 
that this did happened,

And I never want you forget it.

Now helping me in, we've got 
loose ends to tie up here.

We've still the scissors to locate.

I didn't think she'd have
the guts to pull them out.

and I didn't think she'd stab
me in the elevator eader.

You take the powder room,
and I'll check the bedroom.

Ann, Help me, Find the scissors.

Angie! Angie, Open the door.

Angie, Daddy wants you to open the door.

Angie, Pick up the doorknob
and open the door.

Angie, Daddy's not mad. he's not mad,
but open the door Angie.

Over there. Pull up over there.

You ok? It's Alex, it's Alex.

Everything's going to be all right.
Everything's going to be fine.
