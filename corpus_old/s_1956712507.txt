(ALARM RINGING)

Jeremy is leaving!

Hey, bud.
Jeremy is leaving!

Hey, not my head... phones, Josh.

JOSH: Jeremy is leaving!

JARED: What's with him today?
I don't know.

Have you seen my shoes?

He has my shoes?
JEREMY: Yes.

JARED: Josh!


Josh!
JOSH: Jeremy is leaving!

JARED: We know. Stop!

Jared, stop chasing
your brother!

JARED: Give me my shoes.
JOSH: Jeremy is leaving!

Tom. Do something!

Jared, stop chasing
your brother.

JOSH: Jeremy is leaving.

That... That's it? Really?

Jeremy is leaving.
We know. Stop.

Come on, dude.
Give me a minute.

Sit down, buddy.


Here's your shoes.

Listen.

I know, I'm leaving,

and you're upset and you
don't know what to do.

So just take
a deep breath, okay?

Jeremy is leaving.

I know.

Here. Listen to this.

This is gonna
cheer you up.


Just like the show, right?

Watch this.

"Kirk to <i>Enterprise."</i>

You try it.

JOSH: "Kirk to <i>Enterprise.</i>
Hello?"

JEREMY: Listen,
I'm leaving for a while,

but I want you
to have this, okay?

And I promise you
I'm right on the other side.

But that's your phone.

I'll get another one.
New life, new phone.

Sweet.
JEREMY: It's yours, buddy.

I love you, okay?

Okay, come on.

Here we go. Let's do it.

Let's go.
TOM: Come on.

JEREMY: Thanks, Dad.
You got it.

TOM: Jeremy.
Yeah?

Are you sure you don't
wanna take the old guitar?

Dad, it's yours.

Yeah, I know,

but you play it ten
times more than I do.

Dad, I'm not
taking your guitar.

That's your story.


Let's get you to college.

JEREMY: <i>I love you, Mom.</i>

I love you, son.


Okay, son.

Love you, Dad.
Love you.

See you soon.

Hey. Love you guys.

JOSH: Bye.
JARED: Bye-bye. Love you.

Jeremy.

Come here.

JEREMY: No way.
(CHUCKLES)

It's a gift
from all of us.

How did you afford this?

They took out a loan.

And we all agreed to no
Christmas gifts this year.

We worked it out.

TERI: (CHUCKLING) Sure.
TOM: Yeah.

You gotta go.
(BUS DOOR HISSES)

For me,
music is a hobby.

For you,

it's a gift.

So, go write your story.

Go on.

Hurry up.

(BUS DOOR HISSES)

What would you have done
if he took your old guitar?

TOM: Well, I...

I would've kept that one.
(LAUGHS)

(MELODIC MUSIC PLAYING)

JEREMY: Thank you so much.

Thanks. Thank you.

ORIENTATION GUIDE: Welcome
to Calvary Chapel College.

Not a bad front yard, huh?

Not bad at all.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(GIRLS CHATTERING
AND LAUGHING)

Hi.
STUDENT: What's up?

BOY: Wait up!

Hold up.

Hey, man.
Uh, Norm sent me to help load in.

Norm did?
Yeah.

Okay.
Wait, who's Norm?

Hey, man.
You're Jean-Luc, right?

Yeah. Are you in the crew?

Jeremy. I'm Jeremy.

I'm, uh...
I'm a student here.

I'm a freshman. I'm new.
I play the guitar.

Uh, cool.

Dude, I love your music.

You're, like, the reason
I came to school here.

You're a legend.
Oh, don't know about that.

Uh, anyway,
I was wondering, if, uh,

I could ask you some questions
sometime about music?

The industry,
how to make it?

"Make it?"

Yeah.

You're asking
the wrong question.

It's not about making it.

It's about whatever our
songs give people. You know?

So, what do you wanna
give people?

Figure that out first.
Yeah.

Nice to meet you, man.

Hey.

Yes? Yes?

Do you know
how to tune a guitar?


Half a step down.

(CROWD CHEERING IN DISTANCE)
(GASPS SOFTLY)

<i>â™ª Take My hand
and walk where I lead</i>

<i>â™ª Keep your eyes on Me alone</i>

<i>â™ª Don't you say
why were the old days better</i>

<i>â™ª Just because you're scared
of the unknown</i>

<i>â™ª Take My hand and walk</i>

<i>â™ª Take My hand and walk</i>

<i>â™ª Take My hand and walk</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

That was so good. Love it.

GUITARIST: Hey, kid. Guitar!

JEREMY: Here you go.
Thanks, man.

(CROWD CHEERING)


Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

Hi.
Hi.

I, um...

I'm Jeremy.

Melissa.

"Melissa."

Yep.

I saw you tonight.

I mean, I was watching you.
"Watching?"


Watched you.

You were watching me?

Okay.

Okay.
GIRL: Melissa.

I gotta go.


Well, I sing too.
Hmm?

I sing.
I saw you singing.

Nice.

Bye.

JEREMY: <i>A record deal</i>

two years after
you graduated here.

(CHUCKLES)
How?

JEAN-LUC: I just kept
writing songs, man.

It's all about
the songs.

Write what you care about,
what you're afraid of.

Whatever it is,
it needs to be truth.

Is that what you write about?
The truth?

love songs, to God.

Mostly to God.

Sometimes to a girl.
(LAUGHS)

I'm writing one
right now for a girl,

and this girl, man,
she is...


Write what you love, yeah?
Get after it.

Hasten the day.

What does that mean?

You know, a day
with no more pain,

no suffering,
every tear wiped away.

Our music
pulls that closer.

So...

Hasten the day.


JEREMY:
<i>â™ª Why it has to hurt so much</i>

<i>â™ª Give Me
all your sadness â™ª</i>

So, you actually do sing.

And?


I have pretty high standards
when it comes to music,

but it's good.

Like, very good, or...

Yeah, pretty good.

Oh, just "pretty good."

Yeah, pretty good.

Do you write
your own songs?

I'm working
on some stuff.

Can I hear it?

Can you hear it?
Yeah.

Sure, if I can read
your journal.

What? No.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

I should get to class.
Yeah.

You keep singing, Jeremy.

Camp.
Hmm?

Jeremy Camp is my full name.
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

Jeremy Camp.

Hey, what are you
doing tonight?

Tonight?
Oh, that depends.

There's lots of stuff
I could be doing, really.

A lot of things.

Oh, okay. Well, if you
find yourself free at 8:00,

I'll be at the beach,
Oceanside Pier.

You know, stop on by.

It's a date.

What? No.


Really? Because you
literally just asked me out

just right over here.

We'll see.

Oh, yeah, and you should, um,
bring your guitar as well.

Okay.

It's a date.
Not a date!


It's a date.

It's definitely a date.

(MELISSA LAUGHING)

JEAN-LUC: Oh, hey.

Hi! You showed up.
JEREMY: Hey.

Told you it wasn't a date.

JEREMY: Yeah.

Hey. Good to see you.
Hey, man.

Uh, you guys...
I didn't know you guys were friends.

MELISSA: Oh, yeah.
He's my best friend.

keep taking my food.

Well, why won't
you share these?

How long have you,
uh, been friends for?

Oh, um...

Like, freshman year.
I was working at Sunset Point.

JEAN-LUC: Right,
at the restaurant.

Mmm-hmm.
And then we kind of started

this, uh, tradition,
I guess, here.

MELISSA: Mmm-hmm.
Oh, actually, though,

you were truly
my running partner

for my first year at school.
Well, not by choice.

MELISSA: And then he decided
to become a rock star

and get lazy on me.
(JEAN-LUC LAUGHS)

Yeah. Here we are.

You brought your guitar.

I did. Well,
you asked me to.

Right, right. I did.

Maybe you should, um,
start us off with a song.

We always start off with
a song, so it would be nice...

Oh, no. I'm not...

JEAN-LUC: No. Let's hear
what you got. Come on.

Hey, you guys, this is Jeremy Camp.
Right?

(ALL GREETING JEREMY)

And he's going to, uh,
sing for us.

Except, no,
I'm not going to.

Please? Come on.
Do you have a song that you like?

I guess I'm playing a song.

(JEAN-LUC CHUCKLES)

Uh, <i>Find Me In The River?</i>

Yeah. I love that song.

JEREMY: All right.

(CLEARS THROAT)

<i>â™ª Find me in the river</i>

<i>â™ª Find me on my knees</i>

<i>â™ª I've walked
Against the water</i>

<i>â™ª Now I'm waiting if you please</i>

<i>â™ª We've longed
To see the roses</i>

<i>â™ª But never
Felt the thorns</i>

<i>â™ª And bought our pretty crowns</i>

<i>â™ª But never paid the price</i>

(SINGING ALONG)
<i>â™ª We didn't count on suffering</i>

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

<i>â™ª We didn't count on pain</i>

<i>â™ª But if the blessing's
In the valley</i>

<i>â™ª Then in the river I will wait</i>

<i>â™ª Find me in the river</i>

<i>â™ª Find me there</i>

<i>â™ª Find me on my knees
With my soul laid bare</i>

<i>â™ª Even though You're gone
And I'm cracked and dry</i>

<i>â™ª Find me in the river</i>

<i>â™ª I'm waiting here for you</i>

<i>â™ª I'm waiting here for you</i>

<i>â™ª I'm waiting here for you</i>

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

So nice.

Whoo. Hey. What are you...
Hey. What are you...

What are you doing here?

This is where I walk
every morning.

Uh...

Huh. But, how did...
What did...

Nice view.

Well, yeah.
It is really nice.

This is, like,
my favorite place to run.

Do you wanna join?

Run?


I'm not really dressed.

Okay. Well,
bet I could beat you.

I bet you couldn't.

Yeah?

Better give it
a try, then.

I'm not running.

Better run. Fast!

You're huffing pretty hard
back there.

JEREMY: (PANTING) I'm fine.

<i>Hey, can I
ask you something?</i>

MELISSA: <i>Yeah.</i>

What's the deal
with you and Jean-Luc?

You guys,
like, a thing? Or...

Oh.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
It's, um...

(CLICKS TONGUE)

It's complicated.

How so?

He was my first friend
here, actually.

But, uh, I think this year,
his feelings for me, um,

have changed.

And I never felt that way
about him, so...

So, uh,
what do you feel about me?

(CLICKS TONGUE)

This is last night?
JEREMY: Yeah.

You want me
to play it for you,

give you a feel
for the tempo?

No. It's about
the words.

Is there a bridge?
Yeah. It's...

(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

<i>â™ª So you will call
And I will answer</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah</i>

<i>â™ª I hold you
All through the night</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, you will make it
All right</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah</i>

<i>â™ª And I will guard you
Through the night â™ª</i>

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

JEAN-LUC: <i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Since we're all having
such a great time,</i>

<i>I'd like to do something
a little different.</i>

<i>I have a new friend,</i>

<i>and this friend wrote a song
that I think is pretty good.</i>

<i>And I'd like to bring him out
so he can sing it right now.</i>

my friend, Jeremy Camp!</i>

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I'm not gonna...
Go!

I'm not gonna... Melissa!
Oh, my God, go. Go, go, go!



<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

(AUDIENCE RETURN GREETING)

<i>This is kind of,
uh, unexpected. Um...</i>

<i>This song is basically
just, um,</i>

<i>just a bunch of questions
that I have.</i>

(CLEARS THROAT)
(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

<i>So...</i>
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

<i>â™ª In only a moment
Truth was seen</i>

<i>â™ª Revealed this mystery</i>

<i>â™ª The crown that showed
No dignity, He wore</i>

<i>â™ª And the King was placed</i>

<i>â™ª For all the world
To show disgrace</i>

<i>â™ª But only beauty flowed
From this place</i>

<i>â™ª Would you take the place
Of this man?</i>

<i>â™ª Would you take the nails
From His hands?</i>

<i>â™ª Would you take the place
Of this man?</i>

<i>â™ª Would you take the nails
From His hands?</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, oh</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah</i>

<i>â™ª Oh</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

<i>â™ª Would you take the place
Of this man?</i>

<i>â™ª Would you take the nails
From His hands?</i>

<i>â™ª Would you take the place
Of this man?</i>

<i>â™ª Would you take the nails
From His hands?</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, yeah</i>

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

MELISSA: <i>You were
really amazing tonight.</i>

Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

So, does this answer
my question?

What?

You are a piece of work,
you know that?

And?

And I made a promise

that I wouldn't get
distracted this year.

And you're very
distracting, potentially.

A promise to who?

God.

And my sister,
but mostly God.

it's pretty equal between the two of them.

You should
meet my sister.

So, I understand you now.

What?

You don't like
to disappoint people.

That's not true.

Okay, it's sometimes...

Okay, it's true.

This is about
Jean-Luc.

I can't. I...

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

I really
don't wanna hurt him.

So, yeah.
That's why I should just

never look at you again.

Melissa.

Okay.

Permission
to speak freely?

Okay.

What if this is destiny?

What if we were
supposed to meet

and we were supposed to feel
this way about each other,

and God wants us to run towards
it, not away from it?

I think we wouldn't
wanna miss that, right?


Just promise me
you'll think about it.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Raj.

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)


(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
(SIGHS)

Yeah?

Hi.

Okay.

Oh.

Hey.

I thought about it.

All night, actually.

And okay.

"Okay?"

Yes.

Okay.

One date.

Oh.

Yep. Okay, yeah.
All right.

I mean, okay.

Cool.

JEREMY: Yes!
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

It should be starting
pretty soon.

Here we are.

This was always my favorite
room when I was a little girl.

around here?

Mostly.

What do you wanna do
when you graduate?


Everything.

All of it,
you know?

But apparently,

I'm supposed to choose
just one thing,

and I can't
seem to do that.

So, that's why
I like to come here.

The stars always
seem to help.

(DOOR OPENS)

WOMAN: Enjoy the show.

It's starting.

Wow.

MELISSA: Mmm-hmm.


My dad used to take
us sailing a lot,

and you have
not seen stars

until you've seen them
on the open ocean.

Mmm.

Do you see that
right there?

That little blob of light?

That's right,
the little blob of light.

It's called Andromeda.

That's the farthest thing visible
to the naked eye, actually.

What is it, a star?

No, it's a galaxy.

See, our sun is one star
in the Milky Way galaxy.

Do you know how many stars
there are in the Milky Way?


Three hundred billion.

Yeah. Right.

And Andromeda is a galaxy
with one trillion stars.

They all shine together.

So, that, my new friend,

is the definition
of wonder.


God is so infinitely vast,

and this is His painting.

We paint with brushes,

He paints with a billion stars
and a trillion galaxies.

And He knows my name.

The God of a trillion
stars knows my name.

And He has a destiny
just for me.

And I'm gonna
figure it out,

someday.


So that's how
I see the world,

and myself in it.

What are you thinking?

That I've never met anyone
like you before.

Well, I'm just one star
in an infinite galaxy.

Some stars shine brighter
than others.

This is you, right?
No, that's not me.

You sure?
Nope. No, no, no. Shh.

It's late! You're gonna
wake people up. This is me.

This is me.

Okay.
This is me.

Um...

So, Friday night?
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

Yes.

But, um,
could we just keep it

between us right now at
first, you know?

Yeah. No, of course. Of course.
Right?

I'm great
at keeping secrets.

Oh, I'm great
at keeping secrets too.

Great.
It's a secret, then.

Total secret.

Good night.
Good night.

(KEYPAD BEEPING)

Hey, sis.

So, I met someone.

<i>Joshua Tree.</i>
Perfect album.

No way.
I think I have it.

MELISSA: <i>His name is Jeremy.
Jeremy Camp.</i>

<i>He plays music.
I love his songs.</i>

<i>It's so good.</i>

JEREMY: Right. So,
how do you play this?

Okay, Prince?

MELISSA: <i>And I don't know,
there's something about him.</i>

That is the dryer.

You may wanna start
with the washer.

Right.

MELISSA: <i>But we're just gonna
get to know each other.</i>

<i>That's it.</i>


(PANTING) I mean, come on.
That was amazing.

Favorite place?

Ocean.

<i>Definitely ocean.</i>

(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)


PROFESSOR ROCHESTER:
Community service.

When you realize
that life is bigger than you.

You grow when you see...
(MOUTHING) I don't care.

PROFESSOR ROCHESTER: Mr. Camp.

Hmm? Yes?

You wanna come back to Earth?

Honestly, not really.

(STUDENTS LAUGHING)

Aw.

You got a little girlfriend?

So cute. No, really.
It's really, really cute.

All right, you guys...
(MOUTHING) Sorry.

...sign-ups
are in the back.

What's this?

Right now,
it's just a blank tape.

MELISSA: Mmm-mmm.
Tapes have soul.

Why are you
giving this to me?

Well, our record label's
paying for a new album.

So I called the engineer.
He's a friend of mine.

If we hustle, we'll have
an extra couple of hours.

I can get you in there,
and we can turn that into your demo.

No.
Two songs, maybe three.

I'll send it off
to some producers.

I don't know what to say.
Are you serious?

Yeah.

JEREMY: That's amazing.
(JEAN-LUC LAUGHS)

That's... (EXHALES)
MELISSA: Very cool.

You're invited too.
Hmm?

Yeah.
Oh, no. I don't need to go...

No, no, no. Forget that.

Forget that.
I want you there.

MELISSA: I don't wanna go.

I have a song that I'd
like to play for you.

It'll be fun.
Oh. Um,

I don't think that's a...

Hey, look, can I talk
to Melissa for a minute?

Yeah, yeah, sure.

Uh... Oh, okay.
I'll call you later.

Yeah. I'll, uh,

see you later?
Yeah.

Yep. Bye.
JEREMY: Bye.

You were out there
for a long time.

Did he ask you out?

Sort of.

Okay. And?

Doesn't this all
just bother you?

Yeah, of course
it bothers me, Melissa.

You should just tell him.

I can't tell him. I...

Are you wearing his jacket?

Yeah.

You're wearing
Jean-Luc's jacket?

Yes. He gave it to me.
He said I didn't have enough clothes.

And I actually
really like it.

Wow.
This is just... I, I...

I really cannot look at you
in the jacket.

He gave me the jacket.

It's not like I took it
from him.

Maybe... (SIGHS)

Maybe we should
just rethink all of this.

Rethink what,
us dating?

See, now you're mad and
everyone seems to be mad.

I'm not mad.
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

Jeremy!

He's right there.
Hi!

Hey!

TERI: Is this your girlfriend?

Perfect.
JARED: Josh!

So, how long
you two been dating?

(JEREMY CLEARS THROAT)
BOTH: Um...

It's... Not like that.

Yeah. We're just trying
to get to know each other.

TERI: He's really told us
all about you,

like a broken record.
Mom.

Jeremy.
What?

I love Melissa.
(CHUCKLES)

(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Jeremy has a girlfriend!

Josh, that's enough. Come on.
(MELISSA CHUCKLES)

Eat your food.

(SOFTLY IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Jeremy has a...

Jared, shut up.

JEREMY: <i>Okay, you're walking
really fast.</i>

Why are you so mad?
I'm not mad.

Really? 'Cause you
seem mad to me.

Maybe it's because you're
embarrassed by your family,

and I don't get that.

I wasn't embarrassed
by them.

So, you're embarrassed
by me, then?

I'm embarrassed by the fact

that you don't want anyone
to know that we're dating.

It's... It's awkward.

What are we doing here?

What do you even want?

Give Jean-Luc
his jacket back.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

Oh, my gosh.

<i>â™ª This is my desire</i>

<i>â™ª This is my return</i>

<i>â™ª This is my desire</i>

<i>â™ª To be used by You</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, yeah</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah</i>

<i>â™ª This is my desire</i>

<i>â™ª To be used by You</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah</i>

(MUSIC FADES OFF)

How was that?

<i>Really great.</i>

Look who it is.
Look who's here.

<i>When did you write that?</i>

Uh, last night.

<i>After a conversation
with a friend.</i>

<i>All right, everyone.
Let's take five.</i>

JEAN-LUC: Gonna go
work on something,

but I'll see you
in a bit.

Can you hear me?
Do you wanna come in here?

Hey.
Hey.

That was
a really nice song.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, yeah.

I'm really sorry.

I'm really sorry.

Um...

I've been learning a new song,
just the chorus.

Oh.

Can I play it to you?
Sure.

<i>â™ª I love you
I love you, I love you</i>

<i>â™ª I love you, I love you
I love you â™ª</i>

Is that about God?

Not entirely.

Melissa.

(BREATHES SHAKILY) Yeah?

I love you.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Mmm.

I don't think
that I'm ready for that.

Um...

Oh.

Jean-Luc! Hey, hey.

I'm so sorry.
(SIGHS)

I did not want any of that
to happen. I just...

Dude, let me explain.

Don't bother.
There's nothing to explain.

Hear me out.
Dude, I wanted to tell you,

I just didn't know
what to say.

The truth.
(SIGHS)

You should've just
told me the truth.

Melissa, you...

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

Hi.
Hi.

Um, can I come in?

(CLICKS TONGUE) I...

I don't think
that's a good idea.

This is for you.

It's, uh...

It's another journal.

I figure,
after what I've done,

you could use
a lot more pages.

Mmm.

Wait.

I'm sorry that happened.

Obviously.

But

I'm also kind of relieved.

Relieved?

Yeah.

what that means.

I am not relieved.

I don't think Jean-Luc
is relieved.

Okay. "Relieved" isn't
the right word.

I'm happy that
this is not a secret anymore.

I didn't wanna
hurt him, okay?

So, I'm sorry, I just really
don't wanna see you right now.

Hold on. What are you saying?
We're breaking up?

Call it what you want.

Why, I call it breaking up.

Okay.

Then I don't wanna
see you for a while.


(TELEPHONE RINGING)

Hello?

JOSH: <i>Kirk to</i> Enterprise.


Hey, buddy.

<i>It's almost Christmas.</i>

I'm coming home.

(CHUCKLES)
<i>I miss you.</i>

I miss you too.

<i>We put up the Christmas tree.</i>

JEREMY: <i>Yeah?</i>

JEREMY: Thank you.

All right.

Hey, Mom.


(TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

Son.

Hmm?

How are things
with Melissa?

Jeremy has a girlfriend?

No, buddy.

Jeremy doesn't.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

(RINGING STOPS)
TOM: Hello?

(TOM SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

TOM: Jeremy.

Jeremy.

There's a call for you.

Some guy
with the name Jean-Luc.

Sounds important.

Jean-Luc?

JEAN-LUC: <i>Sorry to just call.
I didn't know if you'd heard.</i>

Heard what?

<i>Melissa's sick.</i>

Well, is everything okay?

<i>Jeremy, it's pretty bad.</i>

<i>You should get here.</i>

TERI: Jeremy,
there's a map on the seat.

You sure this is okay?

Yeah, fine. Go.

Just be careful.
It's a long drive.

TERI: Call us
when you get there.

Yeah.

(ENGINE REVS)

Hi.

Uh, I'm here to see Melissa Henning.
I'm a friend of hers.

(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT
OVER PA)

Hey. Hey.

You're Jeremy, right?
Yeah.

JANNETTE: Okay.

Hi. We're Melissa's family.
She's told us all about you.

Nice to meet you.

Hi. You must be Heather.

Mmm-hmm. Big sis.

Uh, how is she?

She's awake.

Yeah.

And I'm sure
she'd love to see you.

Come on.
Yeah.

Hey.
Look who I found.

Hi.

Hi.

When did you get here?

Last night.

I drove.

You drove? From Indiana?

Yeah.

Huh.

JANNETTE: You know what?
Let's...

Let's give them
a minute, okay?

(SIGHS)
(DOOR CLOSES)

(GROANS)
So, um,

what's going on?

Um...

(CLICKS TONGUE) They...

They removed a,
um, tumor

the size of an orange
from my stomach,

tested it,

and it turns out

it's Stage 3C cancer,

whatever that means.

And, um,

it spread to my liver.

So, the truth is,

the odds are not altogether
in my favor.

Melissa, I'm so sorry.

Don't be. It's okay.

I'm okay.

Somehow. I mean,

I can't really describe it.
It's, like,

warm,

like a blanket.

I've been listening to
this Ginny Owens song,

<i>If You Want Me To.</i>

Do you know it?

Yeah.

I just keep thinking,
maybe God

has chosen something
bigger for me,

something I wouldn't
have chosen for myself.

But to be honest with you,
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

I am so scared.

But I have to believe
there's a reason.

If one person's life
is changed

by what I go through,

it will all be worth it.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

JEREMY: Look, man.
I should've told you.

JEAN-LUC: Yeah.

Yeah, you should've told me.

It took me a while,
but I see it now, you two.

JEREMY: Oh, man. I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

I mean, I wanna be there
for her and I wanna help.

I don't even really know
what we are, you know?

How she feels about me.

We've talked about it,

but if she really is
that sick,

it's just hard to know
what's ahead.

There's only one question
you need to answer.

Can you live without her?

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

JEREMY: <i>God,</i>

if she tells me
she loves me...


This is ridiculous.

It's ridiculous.

(KEYS JANGLING)
(ENGINE STARTS)

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

Hi.
Hey.

You came back.

These are for you.

Oh. They're so beautiful.
Thank you.

Yeah. I thought I'd add
to the collection you got.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

You kept that.

Oh, yeah. I've been using it
for a while, actually.

I never got to say thank you.

Still, uh...
Still can't read it?

No, you cannot read it.

Will you, um...

Could you just help...

Could you just help me up
for a second?

Yes. Yeah.

Okay. All right.

Yeah. There we go.
There we go.

This is...

Okay. This is...

What I'm about to say
is gonna be...

Might be weird.

Could be weird.

All right.
Um...

Okay, uh, so, I...

Well, uh, the other day,

when you came by,

it just, uh...
It just really...

It meant a lot to me.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

After you left,

I had this feeling,

like God wanted me
to pray for you.

Okay.

And for your wife.

My wife?
Yeah. Is that weird?

I'm not sure yet.
Okay.

So, I started praying,

and then the more I prayed,

the more I realized,

I love you.

I love you.

Mmm.


I love you.

I do.

And you don't have
to say anything back.

I just really felt...
Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Yeah?
(EXHALES DEEPLY) Uh, um...

Can you just, uh...
Just wait here for one minute?

Just a minute.
I'll be right back.

Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

Okay. Yeah.

Just, uh, don't move.

I can't move.
I'll be right back.


MELISSA:
<i>That wasn't really a minute.</i>

I think you said
"minute," right?

JEREMY: Oh, yeah, no.
I'm sorry.

MELISSA: Yeah. It was,
for sure, like, a while.

Keep them closed.
Okay.

Open.

What?


How did you...

That's why
it took me so long.

MELISSA: Yeah.

I wanted to bring
the galaxy to you.

I want you to know

that whatever this is,
and wherever it takes us,

that I'm with you.

Every step, every moment,
I'm with you. I'm in.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I'm so in.

And, um...

And, you know, I figure
if we're gonna get married,

we have a lot
to talk about.

Married?
Yeah.


I love you.

I love you, I do, madly.

So marry me.

And I know relationships
need to be prayed about,

and you can take as
much time as you need.

But that's why
I brought you here...

Yes.

Yes.

Yeah, I'll marry you.
I'll marry you.

Yes.

TERI: <i>Married?
You're gonna marry her?</i>

<i>But will she get better?</i>

I... I don't know.

Son,

you're only 20 years old.

You just met this girl.

I love her, Dad.

And that's wonderful, but...

Look, look, look. Why don't
you just... (CHUCKLES)

Just slow down,

take a little more time,
you know?

Go one step
at a time here.

Dad,

I'm supposed
to be with her.


I can't explain it.
I just... I know that.

And I don't want it to just be
her story and my story.

I want it to be our story.

I know you're worried,
and I get it.

But...

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I'm gonna marry this girl.

(UPBEAT MUSIC
PLAYING ON PLAYER)

Hey.
Hey.

Thanks.

We made some breakfast.

Wanna have some?

Yeah. Sure.

I brought you something.

I want you to have this.

Mom.

My mom wore it her whole life
till my wedding day,

and I've never
taken it off since.

Are you sure?

Of course.

I just want her
to feel welcome.


When you go.

Are you sure about this?

Melissa, I love you.

And I believe
God is gonna heal you.


Our life starts now.

(CROWD CHEERING)

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)


<i>I want to introduce you guys

<i>This is my fiancee, Melissa.</i>

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

<i>Go ahead
and stand up, babe.</i>


<i>Come on. Stand up.</i>

<i>I know, I'm taken. I'm sorry.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

<i>Earlier this year,
we had some tough news,</i>

<i>some really tough news.</i>

<i>I've never seen a faith
like yours, babe.</i>

<i>It's a beacon for me.</i>

<i>It's a beacon for everyone
who knows you.</i>

<i>It reminds me of a story.</i>

<i>There was a woman who
was sick for a long time,</i>

<i>a really long time.</i>

<i>But she had this...</i>

<i>This total faith</i>

<i>that if she could
just touch Jesus,</i>

<i>just touch his clothes,</i>

<i>that she would be healed.</i>

<i>And that's exactly
what she did.</i>

<i>She broke through the crowd,</i>

<i>and with everything
that she had,</i>

<i>she reached for Him.</i>

<i>Just like I see you do at
every single concert, Melissa,</i>

<i>reaching out in faith,</i>

<i>touching heaven.</i>

<i>Can we do something special</i>

<i>for the most special person
in my life tonight?</i>

(ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD)

<i>Can we pray for her?</i>

<i>Because I believe
that God still heals.</i>

<i>You guys agree?</i>
CROWD: Yeah!

Yes.

<i>Anyone who's sitting
around her,</i>

<i>why don't you go ahead
and lay a hand on her.</i>

<i>If not, just put your hands
in the air.</i>

<i>God, heal the love of my life.</i>

<i>Heal her tonight.</i>

Melissa, your hair isn't
what makes you beautiful.

(DOOR OPENS)

HEATHER: Hey.

Um...

Why don't you go take
a walk or something?

This is kind of
a big deal for her.

Okay.
Yeah.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

No, no, no. It's okay.
Just, you know...

JEREMY: All right.

(MELISSA SIGHS)


JEREMY: <i>Yeah.
You know, she's...</i>

<i>Um, she's living at home now.</i>

<i>I'm just helping
take care of her.</i>

<i>And I just think that, um...</i>

That school can wait.

Right now, this is the only
thing that matters to me.

So, I'll be a semester,

maybe more.

Well, son, that's noble.

But I wonder,
is it really wise?

Well, it's, uh...

It's what's necessary, sir.

DR. FURST: So, even after
the chemotherapy,

we're seeing growth
in your scan.

I'm seeing them
on your ovaries.

And I'm sorry,

but you're going to need
a hysterectomy.

I know that this is
a serious decision,

but I recommend that
it be done very soon.

How soon?

In the next week,
two at the most.

Our doctors are extremely
skilled, and the risks are low.

Wait.

Are you telling me that I'm not
gonna be able to have children?

I'm afraid so.

JEREMY: Hey. It's okay.

No, no, it's not.

I love kids.

You're so good
with kids.

DR. FURST: Melissa,
it's my professional opinion

that this is
absolutely necessary,

given your condition

and what we're seeing
on the tests.

Well, then run more tests,
please. Just run more tests.

We've run them all.

And they're very conclusive.

Mmm.

(CLEARS THROAT)

(MELISSA SIGHS DEEPLY)

JEREMY: Want me
to make you something?

No, I got it.

Here. Let me do it.
No, no. It's okay.

I need a second.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)


(BREATHING HEAVILY)


(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Oh!



(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Oh, no. Oh, God.

Hey.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Okay, okay.
I just can't...

MALE DJ: (ON RADIO)
<i>Welcome back to The Fish,</i>

<i>Los Angeles,</i>

<i>and we have
a great young artist</i>

<i>in the studio with us today,
Jeremy Camp.</i>

FEMALE DJ: <i>Yes. And Jeremy's
gonna do some songs</i>

<i>live for us in just a minute.</i>

<i>But first, Jeremy,</i>

<i>you have some pretty big news
you wanted to share with us?</i>

JEREMY: <i>I do, yeah.</i>

First off, thank you so much
for having me. (CHUCKLES)

Um, for everyone listening,
my fiancee's name is Melissa.

Uh,

she has a huge surgery
coming up this week,

and it's really serious.

And basically,
she needs a miracle.

So I just wanted to
ask everyone listening,

if you could just stop
what you're doing and pray.

<i>I'll do the playing.
You guys do the praying.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

(DOOR OPENS)

Hey, buddy.
Hey.

I, uh...

I stopped by
the radio station,

and it's like
the whole city's praying.

Dude, these letters are
pouring in from everywhere.

No way.
(CHUCKLES)

I thought
you'd want to have them.

Hang in there.

Thanks, man.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

HEATHER: Can I sit with you?

Yeah.

It's so weird
seeing her here.

She's always been
the strong one.

Yeah.

I'm really glad that
in the midst of all of this,

someone is choosing her,

someone really special.

Thank you for giving her
a chance...

JANNETTE: Jeremy!

Jeremy!

Yeah.

(IMPERCEPTIBLE DIALOGUE)

MELISSA: Mmm.

(EKG BEEPING)

Hey.

Jeremy.

(JEREMY CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Your cancer,

it's gone.

They didn't go through
with the surgery.

You're cancer-free.

And that is the story you're
gonna tell our kids one day.

You know what you are?

JEREMY: (OVER MICROPHONE) <i>If
anyone here has ever wondered</i>

<i>if miracles still happen,</i>

<i>or if God still heals,</i>

<i>then I wanna introduce you</i>

<i>to the most beautiful girl
in this room.</i>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)

You're a miracle.

That's what you are.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

(CHEERING GROWS LOUDER)

JEAN-LUC: (OVER RADIO)
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

<i>I spoke to the doctor myself.</i>

<i>There is literally
no medical explanation,</i>

none whatsoever.

That is awesome.

For everyone listening
out there,

<i>on positive,
encouraging K-LOVE,</i>

<i>she's 100% cancer-free.</i>

JEAN-LUC: <i>Amen. Yes, she is.</i>

(CHEERING CONTINUES)

(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

I will love you,

cherish you,

honor you,

every moment of every day

without hesitation

and never looking back.

MELISSA: I'll encourage you,

lift you up,

I'll be your muse

and your anchor.

I'll be the love of your life

and your biggest fan.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Until death do we part.

Nope, past that.

I will love you past that.

Son, you may
kiss the bride.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Mr. and Mrs. Jeremy Camp.
ALL: Aw.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Through the storm
and out the other side.

Can you believe it?

Mmm-mmm.

Thank you,
Jeremy Camp.

I think I would have died
without you.

I would have been lost
and alone at sea.

God sent you to save me.

Melissa Camp.
(CHUCKLING)

JEREMY: I like
the sound of that.

MELISSA: <i>Ready?</i>
JEREMY: <i>Yeah.</i>

Okay. One, two, three.
JEREMY: ...two, three.

JEREMY: What did you wish for?

MELISSA: I wrote down
some names...

Names I've been dreaming of.

Family?
Mmm-hmm.

(IN SING-SONG VOICE) I've got
a surprise for you tomorrow.

Really?
Mmm-hmm.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

Phew.

That's, uh,
so strange.

What?

Oh, uh...
I don't know.

You've never
been sailing

and I'm the one
who gets sick.

(MELISSA MOANS)

JEREMY:
<i>â™ª Will I believe You</i>

<i>â™ª When You say</i>

<i>â™ª That Your hand will guide me
In every way</i>


(JEREMY CONTINUES SINGING
INDISTINCTLY)

<i>â™ª Walk by me</i>

(GROANS SOFTLY)

Jeremy. Hey. Hey.


Something's wrong.

Something is really wrong.

HEATHER: Hey.

How does it feel?

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

Jeremy.
Hey. Wanna come in?

No. Actually,
let's talk out here.

DR. FURST: (FAINTLY)
So, what's going on?

She's having a little
pain, feeling bloated.

Liss, hey.
I'm sure it's fine.

The cancer's come back.

It's spreading rapidly.
It's all over her body.

Okay. What does that mean?

That means we have
to have another surgery?

No. No more surgeries.

What? Chemo then?

No. We're stopping
treatments.

There's nothing else
we can do.

(VOICE FADING)
I'm afraid to say

she only has
a few weeks,

a couple months
at the most.

I'm so sorry, Jeremy.


I'll be right back.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(WATER RUNNING)


(MELISSA CRYING)

Okay.

This should help
with the pain.


Clamp.

Swab.

Okay.

We got this.

We got this.

Is there a concert
I didn't know about?

Not a great turnout,
Jeremy Camp.

No. I just wanted you
to see it.

See what?

Where it happened for me.

This is where
I was standing.

Right here,

when I fell in love with you.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

Come on. "Fell in love?"

On the first night?
Yeah.

You were sitting
right there.

The girl who sat there
seems so far away now.

I feel like
a shadow of her.

On our first date,

you said,

"Some stars

"shine brighter than others."

You know the stars
that shine the brightest?

The ones
with the shortest life.

And when they die,

they explode
in a supernova.

It's...

It's the most
beautiful thing.

Color and light
all mixed together,

God's painting.

The death
of a single star

outshines everything
else in the galaxy.

Melissa.

What if I'm not
supposed to be healed?

No, don't. Don't.

Don't say that.

I want you to
promise me something.

(VOICE BREAKING) I want you
to find someone else.

Don't. Don't.

You're going to be healed.

I promise you that.

Jeremy.

Would you just stop?

Stop making promises
that aren't yours to make.

(MELISSA RETCHING, COUGHING)

Jeez. Did I forget the dose?

It hurts. It hurts.

So bad.

I'm okay. I'm okay.
Melissa. No. You're not okay.

Come on.
No. I'm okay.

We're going to the hospital.
Come on.

Help! Somebody help!

Somebody help!

DOCTOR: Nurse, we're gonna
need a wheelchair!

(EKG BEEPING)

last time you slept?

Go home. Get some rest.
Go shower.

We got this.
I can't.

Just get a few hours.

Come on. Go home.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

She is my home.

(MOANS WEAKLY)


Hey.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

Did you finish the song,

the one from our honeymoon?

Yeah.

Will you please
play it for me?

(GUITAR STRUMMING)

<i>â™ª Would you believe me
When I say</i>

<i>â™ª That Your hand
Will guide every way</i>

<i>â™ª Every moment, every day</i>

<i>â™ª Well, I will walk by faith</i>

<i>â™ª Even when I don't see</i>

<i>â™ª Even a broken road</i>

<i>â™ª Prepares Your will for me</i>

(SOBBING SOFTLY)

<i>â™ª Well, I will walk by faith</i>

<i>â™ª Even when I don't see</i>

<i>â™ª Even when I don't see</i>

That was so beautiful.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

(EKG BEEPING STEADILY)

(EKG BEEPING RAPIDLY)

(GASPS LOUDLY)


(EKG BEEPS)

You okay?

(EKG BEEPS)

It's God.

It's God.
What do you mean?

I'm healed.

It doesn't hurt anymore.
I can't feel it.

You were right.

I'm telling you,
I'm healed.

I think I'm okay.
I think I'm okay.

Babe, lie down, lie down.
I'll get the doctor.

You have to believe me.

Just believe me.

I'm okay.

Okay. I'm gonna
get the doctor.

Excuse me, can I get
a doctor for my wife?

Okay. Slow down.
What's the issue?

Dr. Furst,
Melissa's awake.

(EKG BEEPING)

Someone help! Someone help!

(EKG BEEPING RAPIDLY)

I love you.

(EKG FLATLINING)

She's with Jesus.

JANNETTE: (CRYING) No.

I didn't get to say goodbye.

I'm Tom Camp.

I'm looking for my son,
Jeremy.

Mr. Camp.

He's still in the room.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

Get some sleep.

See you in the morning.

Mom and I will have breakfast
ready for you when you get up.

JEREMY: Dad?

Can I ask you a question?

Anything.

I remember I prayed
and prayed in this room

for Josh to be
born healthy.

It didn't happen.

And you prayed for so long
for your ministry.

Still nothing.

Dad, I begged God
to heal Melissa.

What am I supposed
to do with that?

Are you asking
if Josh's disabilities

were disappointing?

Yes, they are.

Did I have big dreams
that didn't come true?

Sure.

Do I understand why Melissa
isn't here anymore?

No, son, I don't.

I'm sorry.

But I know
my life is full.

I feel rich,

and I'm proud
of this family.

Honestly, at the time,

I didn't agree
with what you did.

I didn't understand it.

You chose willingly to walk
into the fire with her.

Right beside her,
all the way to the end.

But then,

that's exactly what I would do
for your mom and you boys.

That's what love is.

And I got to watch
my son do that.

For his wife.

That was a privilege.

I don't know the answers
to your questions.

But I do know this,

that my life is not full

in spite of
the disappointments.

It's full because of them.

I'm proud of you.

I love you, Dad.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

MELISSA: <i>Jeremy.</i>

<i>I'm healed.</i>

<i>I think I'm healed. It's God.</i>
(EKG BEEPING)

You know the stars
that shine the brightest?

<i>The ones
with the shortest life.</i>

You're going to be healed.

HEATHER: <i>I need a doctor!</i>

JEREMY: <i>I promise you.</i>

MELISSA:
<i>It doesn't hurt anymore.</i>

<i>I can't feel it.</i>

<i>You were right.
You have to believe...</i>

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

Why did You do this?

MELISSA: <i>Jeremy.</i>

<i>I know
you'll find this someday.</i>

<i>See? I'm finally letting you
read my journal.</i>

<i>And I've thought a lot about
the day I realized I loved you.</i>

<i>Remember?</i>

<i>I just watched you there,
awestruck by your gift.</i>

<i>Knowing God would use it
someday to touch the world.</i>

<i>I felt that day
the same way I do now.</i>

<i>You're asleep on my shoulder
right now.</i>

<i>I guess one of the benefits</i>

<i>of the pain is that
it's hard to sleep.</i>

<i>Which means I have
a lot of time to think.</i>

<i>And I've thought a lot
about the stories</i>

<i>you love to tell
at your concerts.</i>

<i>You're so good at it.</i>

<i>Ancient stories,</i>

<i>still relevant and true.</i>

<i>In one story,
God grants healing.</i>

<i>Miracles do happen.</i>

<i>Yet to another, His call
is to suffer, and even die.</i>

<i>And I realized something,</i>

<i>they both have value.</i>

<i>Because each is a chapter
in a bigger story.</i>

<i>Each is the stroke of a brush
on His beautiful canvas.</i>

<i>Each is the light of one star
helping to form a galaxy.</i>

<i>And I think I'm one of
those lucky people</i>

<i>meant to experience both.</i>

<i>I had my miracle.</i>

<i>It led to the perfect day
with you.</i>

<i>It was enough.</i>

<i>I've learned that suffering
doesn't destroy faith,</i>

<i>it refines it.</i>

<i>And God is worth trusting.</i>

<i>Even when we can't see.</i>

<i>I'm safe in His arms</i>

<i>going bravely into the light
with a peace</i>

<i>that I can't understand.</i>

<i>So, do one thing
for me, Jeremy Camp,</i>

<i>for my sake.</i>

<i>For the sake of your gift
and everyone meant to hear it.</i>

<i>When you're ready,</i>

<i>pick up your guitar.</i>


(CROWD CHEERING)

JEAN-LUC: <i>And now,
we have an artist</i>

<i>with his first gold record</i>

<i>with five number one
hit singles.</i>

<i>He has a story to tell.</i>

<i>Let's welcome
my friend Jeremy Camp.</i>

(CROWD CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)

<i>What's going on, guys?</i>

<i>My name is Jeremy Camp.</i>

<i>Uh...</i>

<i>A few years ago,
I met a girl named Melissa,</i>

<i>and she is, and always will
be, the love of my life.</i>

<i>Melissa died
with this incomprehensible,</i>

<i>selfless faith.</i>

<i>She was always
reaching for heaven.</i>

<i>And I believe
she finally touched it.</i>

<i>I believe
she finally touched it,</i>

<i>and she had to tell me that
there would be another day,</i>

<i>with no more pain,</i>

<i>with no more tears,
with no more sorrow,</i>

<i>another day where I would
get to see her again.</i>

<i>I know I'm not the only one
hurting here today.</i>

<i>She told me that
if just one person's life</i>

<i>was changed by her story,</i>

<i>then it would've
all been worth it.</i>

<i>Just one.</i>

<i>So, this one's for her.</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

I still believe</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

<i>â™ª Though the questions
Fog up my mind</i>

<i>â™ª With promises
I still seem to bear</i>

Slowly unwind</i>

I see You prepare</i>

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Jeremy.

Uh, you don't,
uh, know me.

I feel like I knew her,
your wife.

Melissa.

I was there the night
that you prayed over her.

We were the next band.

I'd just gotten in
from South Africa

and I was, uh,
going through a really hard time.

And I honestly
was trapped

in this web of, like,
apathy and disappointment.

I had lost someone
close to me.

I was angry
and hurt and...

I thought the world
was full of hypocrites

and I was the worst of them.

I guess
I just wanted to know

that God was real,
somewhere in the universe,

like, to a person.

An actual person in an
actual, meaningful way.

And I looked at her,

your wife, that night.

She was, like, glowing

with something
I've never had.

Her story
and your story, it...

It rescued me.

I'm the one

whose life was changed.

And there will be
millions more.

I just wanted you
to know that.

Thank you.

It means a lot.

Hey.

What's your name, again?

Adrienne.

JEREMY: You were right.

I've never seen stars
like this before.

I love you, Melissa.

And I'm gonna tell your story.


ADRIENNE:
<i>I feel very protective</i>

<i>of Jeremy and Melissa's story,</i>

(VOICE BREAKING)
<i>I think, because of how much</i>

<i>the Lord did in my life.</i>

<i>That it was something
that I needed to hear.</i>

JEREMY: <i>God was telling me to
pick my guitar up, and I'm like,</i>

<i>"The last I wanna do
is pick my guitar up."</i>

<i>I remember feeling the presence
of God so thick in that room.</i>

<i>Like, just, like,
I needed that.</i>

<i>Right what came out was just,</i>

<i>"Okay. I still believe."</i>

<i>Literally. Like,
"I still believe in You."</i>

<i>That's what I wanted to say.</i>

<i>This is something that God
gave me as a gift to heal me,</i>

<i>and I believe that God was gonna
use it to heal many people.</i>
