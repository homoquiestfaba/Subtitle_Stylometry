Ladies and gentlemen, your
hosts, Jonah Ray and Kumail
Nanjiani!

Yay!

This is for you guys.

Grabbing your boobs.
Grabbing your boobs.

Is that the wrong direction?

There's only One Direction.

How many One Direction
fans are here?

And just be honest,
this is a safe place.

Oh, you're an idiot.

I'm joking.
Yeah, yeah.

Are you a One Direction fan?

You are. No, it's okay.

So, how old are you?

20.
20.

That's slightly too old.
Yeah, yeah.

What's your name?
Frankie.

Frankie...
that's a great name.

Um, it's too weird,
it's like--
20, 20, Kumail, 20.

D'uh-- I'm--

KUMAIL (O.S.):
Um, what's their big song?

Oh, You Don't Know
You're Beautiful?

That's Why You're Beautiful.

Do you know you're beautiful?

You don't know?

20. 20.

Yeah, bro, could you just
give me like 30 seconds?

Do you know you're beautiful?

That's what makes you beautiful?
You're like-- you've like bought
into this.

JONAH (O.S.):
Yeah.

Well, you're beautiful, Frankie.
20!

Are you--

Did any--

Th-- who likes the Shins?

I just want her to know
she's beautiful.
Oh, god.

Tell her in your van, Kumail.

Have you ever had vodka?

Eeew!

It's really good.
It makes you feel beautiful.

This is-- this show
has two speeds.

Racism and statutory.

And baby, this ain't racism.

Steven Agee, you're so great!.

KUMAIL (O.S.):
Are you guys ready
for more show?

JONAH (O.S.):
Ladies and gentlemen,
Steve Agee!

Wow, that was awesome.
This is a very exciting night.

It's actually been a great day.

I found out earlier, I can in
fact, fuck my way out of a paper
bag.

Take that, Linda, my estranged
wife. It wasn't that difficult.

It's even easier if it's wet.

I, uh, when I was in college,
me and my best friend Sam,
were sitting there...

high, and I mean like
college high.

We were sitting around
in my apartment,
and we were desperately...

45 minutes, trying to remember
the name of the actress...

who played the receptionist
in Ghostbusters.

45 minutes, it's two of us
just sitting there going...

Agh! Don't talk, it's on the
tip of my tongue, dude!

After 45 minutes, out of nowhere
my friend just gives up
and goes...

"Screw it, I'm gonna make soup."

That was weird, because no one
ever cooked in my apartment.

So he gets up and he goes into
the kitchen, and I hear him
digging around...

and all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, he goes...

"Hey, man, do you
have any pots?"

I go, "Yeah, dude, nice one,
nice save, you got it."

And he's like-- he doesn't
realize it, he's like, "What?"

I go, "Annie Potts, the actress,
her name was Annie Potts."

He realized what happened,
and he comes out of the kitchen
trembling.

Like convulsing.

He's like, "Dude, what just
happened?"

And then, I realize it,
and I start shaking.

I'm like, "Dude, I don't know.
That's crazy, right?"

Try telling me there's
no God after hearing that.

I picture him up in heaven
watching us, going, "You idiots!
It's Annie Potts!

"People are starving and they
need my help, but I'm invested
in this now.

"Uh, okay, think, oh, okay, um--

"All right, I'll make
the little one crave soup...

"and then I'll hide
the fat guy's pots.

"And then I'm gonna invent
the internet...

"because I don't have time
for this incidental bullshit."

is first crushes.

Do you want to know mine?

Yeah, what's yours, baby?
All right.

First off, I want to state
that I am married, to a woman.

But my first huge crush
was Robin Hood.

The cartoon!

The cartoon Robin Hood fox,
that was like my first crush...

where I was watching the Disney
version of Robin Hood.

He's a fox.
He's a fox.

In more ways than one.

He, like, it's like I saw it
and I was just like...

"Oh, he's so charming
and he is so--"

And then, like, I started
becoming a big fan
of George Clooney...

and I never knew why
I was so into him right away.

And then when
Fantastic Mr. Fox came out...

I saw him in fox form
and I was like, "Oh!"

Because he's thinking,
if Robin Hood the fox
was a human...

Yes!
That's George Clooney's
entire life.

That's his life, he's just
a charming, kind of whatever...

wants to do, gives things
to the poor, it's great.

My first crush wa-- okay,
did you guys ever see, uh...

Sleeping Beauty?
That cartoon?

Oh, wait, that's like,
kinda rape-y.

Okay, but that's not my crush.

My crush was the bad lady from,
you remember, Maleficent?

Yeah, oh my god, so hot.

The one that turns
into a dragon?

Yeah! What's hotter than that?

You just like have sex with her
and then you get a dragon ride!

She's got two horns, I know
where one of them is going,
right?

I don't know where
one of them is going.

And then, I found out that
there's gonna be a movie...

coming out called Maleficent,
starring Angelina Jolie!

So, it's like I went back
through time and space...

and met a 12-year-old me and we
just high-fived our boners.

We just rubbed
our boners together.

And it's not pedophilia,
at worst, it's statutory
masturbation.

I feel like I could seduce
a younger version of me.

Let me guess, you like
Donatello? Here's a Twix.

Twix, that makes a lot of sense.
Two little brown sticks
next to each other.

And your husband's out there
talking about his first crush.

So I don't want to create
acrimony here...

I'm very comfortable.
Because they work
very closely together.

I'm very comfortable.
But he's talking about stuff.

He cheats on me constantly.

Wow, but only
with cartoon characters.

I have a wife and five kids
and sometimes I get sent
to the store.

If I get sent to the store,
it's for one item and usually
a convenience store.

In this case,
it was a carton of milk.

Outside the convenience store,
I noticed a man standing
over to the left.

He has one leg... but he also
has a t-shirt on that says,
"Leg story, $10."

What do I know? I have two
pieces of information.

There's a man with one leg,
and a story to tell.

Who am I to judge?

This guy could inspire me...
with his story.

Hand him a ten dollar bill, say,
"All right, sir, I'd like
to hear your story.

"What is it, are you a vet?"

He said, "No, sir,
here's my story.

"The wife and I went to a
second-hand thrift store.

"We came upon a recliner.

"I said 'We're buying it.'

"My wife said it smells like
mold. I said, 'Shut yours,
woman.'

"We loaded it
into the pick-up truck.

"As we got home, I put the
recliner in front of the
television and I sat down.

"And then I exclaimed, 'Argh!'

"A spring had sprung loose
from the back of the recliner...

"and impaled the back of my leg.

"I didn't let on to the wife.

"A little later that evening,
she exclaimed it was time
for dinner.

"I said, 'I'll be eating
in the new recliner.'

"I realized I could not
extricate myself from said
spring at that point.

"Even later that night,
she said she's going to bed.

"I said, 'I'll be sleeping
in the new recliner,'...

"which was a mistake,
because as I slept...

"that spring dug deeper
slinky-like into the back
of my leg.

"In the morning, my wife awoke
and announced she'd be staying
at her sister's...

for a couple days. 'Good for
you,' I said, 'bad for me.'

"As I realized soon thereafter,
that spring must have had
some rust on it.

"Because I got tetanus,
which causes lockjaw.

"She returned two days later,
and as you can imagine
at this point...

"I could not speak and I had
defecated all over myself.

"She called the emergency
medical technicians.

"They removed me from the
recliner, took me to the
hospital and removed my leg.

"End of story."

Well, okay, less inspiring
than I'd hoped.

More of a cautionary tale...
about hubris and arrogance.

But thank you for your story.
I have some milk to procure.

He said, "Would you like to hear
how I lost my left nut for
another ten dollars?"

I said, "No, I think I'm good."

He said, "I'll show you
for five."

Let me tell you something,
folks.

That's the best five dollars
I ever spent.

Yeah.

What were your first crushes?
First crush.

Let's--
just raise your hand.

Yes, sir.

Ooh! Wait!
Christina Ricci in the
Addams Family.

Addams Family Values was when
she tears shit up at the camp.

And then you want to--
like, yeah, that stirred up
a lot of stuff for me.

And then, like, the boy she
likes is like this nebbishy
glasses kid... yeah.

Let's do a couple more.
A couple more.

Joey McIntyre
from New Kids on the Block.

You know what, it's hard when
women had crushes on people who
were so different from me.

That's what's hard, like--
Oh, Jesus--

There was nobody here that had a
crush on anyone who was--

Aladdin?

I was wrong. That doesn't
feel good, either.

Well, tonight I'm doing
something where I'm
actually gonna do--

I'm setting three-- something
I've always wanted to do.

Three mics... one is gonna
be for regular bits.

One mic is gonna be for bits
that don't have very much--
just like orphans.

Just like one-liners.

In the middle is gonna
be for true emotional things.

We're gonna start with orphans.

Must be nice to be old, because
you can wear like a Band-Aid
on your face for no reason.

And also you can make noises
and people just accept it.

Where you can just be like--

( CLEARS THROAT )

Um, I've had two girls break up
with me in the last year...

and I like, fuck, I cried really
hard.

And usually I cry, 'cause
when I break up with girls,
because I feel guilty.

But this time I cried,
because I felt like, loss.

Look, these computers are too
powerful, am I right?

Just these phones and computers
are great, but they're
too powerful.

We're turn-- we're all like
Roman Emperors now...

just on our computers all day...

on Facebook and YouTube.

Don't like, that I like.

Incoming call... ignore.

We gotta figure this out,
because we have people giving
these, that are not qualified.

Because I was on YouTube,
Beethoven's 5th Symphony.

Dih-dih-dih-deh.
Dih-dih--

Like the most famous song
of all-time.

10,000 dislikes on YouTube.

I'm not kidding, that many
people were like...

"Your music stinks, bro, and
I know music, I'm from Tampa.
Thumbs down."

That ASPCA commercial,
with Sarah McLachlan?

And they had to-- they had to--
they finally stopped doing it.

Because they were-- they were
saving a lot of dogs...

but a lot of human beings
were taking their own lives.

Oh, um, so I have depression
and I take anti-depressants.

And people-- like people go--

It's like it's stigmatized,
people were like, "You're weak."

And it's like, I'm not weak,
I just, like, I don't wake up
and go, "I'm weak."

I just go like,
"Oh, this is fair."

I got no hobbies.

I actually, I watch
documentaries, that's my
only hobby.

I watched this really good
Lance Armstrong documentary.

It's called The Armstrong Lie,
anybody see it?

All right, it's fantastic,
one guy.

Um, fantastic.

Going to the movie,
I thought-- we all thought
about Lance Armstrong...

which was he's a piece
of garbage.

But now that I've seen the
movie, it's a little more
complicated than that...

because, all right, he won the
Tour de France seven times...

on drugs every time,
but here's the thing.

He also raised $100 million
for cancer research.

Say what you want about the guy,
but he figured out a way
to do drugs for charity.

That's something.

And it must have been hard to
resist, too, because if someone
came to me and was like...

"Neal, you can cure pediatric
AIDS, but you're gonna have
to do a ton of cocaine."

I'd be like, "Let's help
some kids, huh?"

Over right there.

Adam Scott, that's a new--
that's your first crush?

That's kind of new.

You waited a long time.
Yeah.

Late bloomer, that's not
a good--
That's-- I don't--

Uh...

Uh, I think someone
just said my name.

Wait, do you just show up when
your name's called.

Well, when it involves
a crush, I do.

Uh...
That's her.

Who? I'm sorry,
who is it, you?

Yeah.
Hi.

Uh, I'm Adam.
What's your name?

Danielle.

Danielle, hi.

I feel like we should
leave the room.
Yeah.

No, no, no, no, no, I don't want
to make this weird for anybody.

I just wanted to say hello,
and say thank you...

and, uh--

Do you want to like,
come up here and--

KUMAIL (O.S.):
What's gonna happen?
JONAH (O.S.): I-- I don't--

KUMAIL (O.S.): Oh, no.
ADAM (O.S.): Hi.

DANIELLE (O.S.):
Hi.

I'm Adam, sorry, I already said
that. I already said that.
You already introduced yourself.

Like, where are you from?

I live here in LA.

LA, did you--
Oh, that's convenient.

Sorry, Kumail, do you-- do you
have something you need to say?

Can I...
I'm sorry, bro.

speak with Danielle?
No, no, I don't want to--

Mow another guy's lawn,
I don't know.
Thank you.

It's not his lawn yet.

I-- I-- I hope
I'm not jumping the gun...

or any other, this is weird,
or whatever, but, um, like...

Will you marry me?

Uh, you're married.
Yeah, you're married.

You have a kid.

I am no longer married.

I more mean like--
Where do you
secretly want to go?

When I see a person that's
using-- like a Maria Bamford.

Well, that's so out of--
in the ether, it's hard to--

When I go, "Oh, man,
I wish I could do that."

It's like, well, I'm sure
everybody wishes they could
do everything...

that they're looking
and aren't doing.
Yeah, and yeah.

Yeah, I wish I could be
Rory Scovel and like
do a bong rip and kill...

harder than anyone in the world,
and do a different set
every night.

Well, I don't know
if Rory Scovel kills harder
than anyone in the world.

I do pretty well.

That's amazing,
I'm the best looking comic.

I think I'm the best looking
comic, not of all, but
tonight or whatever.

How do you think I look?
Do you think I look--

What do you think?
What do you think?

You like the look?
I feel like I look good.

MAN (O.S.):
Clown.

What?

MAN (O.S.):
You look like a clown.

All right.

No, I think you're pretty good,
but I just-- you look like
a French clown.

Doesn't he look like
a French clown? Look,
take off your glasses.

Take off those glasses.

Dude, I don't want to do--
I'm trying to do a TV set.

Look, you should be doing mime
or something, not comedy.

Take off the glasses.
Your glasses.

French clown, you look
like a French clown.

Doesn't he look--
French clown.

Do some mime for us.
Do some mime.

Please, do some mime.
I'm not-- I don't--

Imagine there's a banana
in front of you.
You're holding a banana.

All right, hol--

Hold up a banana in front
of you, in front of your
face, a banana.

Actually I don't-- I don't--
I don't know how to do--

I don't think
I want to do this.
Hold the banana in front of you.

No, I really, like,
don't want to do--

There's a banana
in front of you.
I don't want to-- no.

Okay, imagine there's
a penis in front of you.

Okay, yeah. Okay.

All right, like, okay, what are
you gonna do with this banana
penis situation?

All right, okay, you're
stroking the banana penis.

All right, I get it.
He's stroking the banana.

All right, you're peeling the
banana foreskin off the banana.

Okay, what are you gonna do--
okay, you've got a bana--

And he eats it, he ate it,
everybody. He ate the banana.

He ate the banana.

That's perfect, that's that
French clown magic right there.

Do another one.

Okay, he steps up to the plate,
he's-- okay, no--

He's gettin' the signal
from the-- the something.

Oh, he's pitching the ball.
He's pitching it.

All right, it's coming.

All right, he hits the ball,
it's a home run.

It's coming back, he catches
the ball, he eats it.

He ate it.
He ate the ball.

He ate the baseball.

This is the best. All right,
another one. Here we go.

Now you want to do it.
All right, good.

All right, he's going fishing.
He's fishing.

He's sitting there,
he's waiting for that big one.

Oh, he's caught something.
You got that great white!

You gotta pull it in.
You got-- okay, pull it in.

Pull it in, all right,
those are reins.

They're reins to a horse.
He's pulling.

All right,
the horse is sinking.

Artax, Artax, you're sinking.

You have to fight the sadness!
Artax, please!

These hands--

They look like big,
strong hands, don't they?

Wait a second.
Better save some for later.

We've got a long way to go...

but it was the only way
we can get in touch
with an earthling child.

But what if he doesn't
know what he has to do?

What do I have to do?
He has to give me a new name.

He's already chosen it.
He just has to call it out.

It's not real,
it's only a story.

It's not real.
Bastian, say my name!

I can't! I can't! I have
to keep my feet on the ground!

Bastian, please! Save us!

Okay, I will!
I will do what I dream!

( YELLING GIBBERISH )

Moon Child.

And this...
is all that remains.

A Fantasia... and he eats it!

He ate it, everybody!
He ate it!

Thank you, everybody.

That was everything I hoped
it would be... and more.
That was amazing!

Thank you so much
for coming, guys!

Thank you so much
for coming to the Meltdown!
Get home safe!

Thanks for hanging out!

KUMAIL (O.S.):
Thanks for watching!

Yeah.
If the crowd,
like doesn't get it, then...

We did it in New York,
they start screaming at him.

Sit the fuck down!
Really?

This isn't that kind of place!
We don't heckle here!
