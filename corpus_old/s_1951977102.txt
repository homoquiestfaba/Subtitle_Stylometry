20 years ago.

She's a divorcee.

Get outta here.

''...their lovely daughter Elena.''

''Good morning, my sweet.

''What a splendid day!

''Be careful you don't spill it!''

Martin! Come on in. Quick. Come on.

Quick! Get in here.

-No, sir!

-So, am l Sid?

Damn right l am! Have a drink, kid.

...no-previous-owner genius.

-You have? Who?
-Only the best radio writer in the US of A.

-News writer?

-Great news, Sam. Great news!
-Yeah.

Pedro Carmichael! Damn!

Great news, Sam. l'll see you later.

<i>''Margaret. That cup of coffee</i>
<i>really was delicious.''</i>

''Nothing is too much for you, my treasure.
How is my dear husband today?''

''Excellent. The attack of colic
seems to have left no lasting ill effect.''

<i>Thank goodness, my darling.</i>
<i>l was so worried about you.</i>

<i>That means you will be absolutely well...</i>

<i>...for the wedding of our daughter Elena</i>
<i>to Elmore Dubuque...</i>

<i>...New Orleans' richest, most eligible bachelor.</i>

<i>Yes, the son of one of the oldest...</i>

<i>...and wealthiest families in the Garden District.</i>

<i>-Think of it, Robert, our own little daughter</i>/
-Would you turn that garbage off?

My God, l think l used to live around here.

Yeah? l guess after New York
it must seem kind of small.

l'm sorry l never got to meet Uncle Max.

Why?

l heard he was an artist.

Yeah. Sure, l forgot. Vladimir was the last one.

Yeah, sorry. l got mixed up.

Maxie and Vlad. Boy, can l pick 'em.

-l hate men.
-You do?

Yeah, l do. l really do.

l really hate them. l hate what they do.
They're such jerks. They're so dumb!

But l got to find me one fast.

Well, Don!

You know my brother Don.
Better late than never.

Gettin' even thinner up there, baby brother.

lf l need a spare tire, l know just who to call.

Redecorated again? You lawyers have it tough.

You just keep catching 'em, Don,
because they pay my fees.

-Hi!
-Hi.

Excuse me.

-Go in there and talk to people.
-Olga, will you please relax?

How are you?

Here, Martin. Please talk to people.

Julia, my dear, l've been meaning to ask.

We have our annual convention this week.

Yes. There's a dinner dance tomorrow night.

A very pleasant affair.

Just the Fayette Parish Timber Merchants
and their guests.

-l was wondering if--
-Darn it! Wouldn't you know...

...Marty invited me to the movies tomorrow...

...and l can't disappoint him, now, can l?

l don't mind, Mr. Aslinger. Really.
lt's no problem. l couldn't care at all.

-ln that case<i>....</i>
-That isn't what you said before.

That isn't what he said before.

No, l yield to you.

-lt's not necessary.
-l yield to you.

Thank you. Excuse me.

l'll be right back.

Marty!

Thank you for saving me from the lobster.

l know what you're thinking.
Don't worry about it.

l'll pay. Even the popcorn's on me.

l still think you'd have more fun
with the Fayette Parish Timber Merchants.

-There's a new Gene Kelly movie at the<i>....</i>
-Abalon.

The Abalon. Right!
Tomorrow night at 6:00? Don't be late.

-We'll be late!
-Okay.

Hey!

-What's going on?
-Good evening.

That's my typewriter!

Wrong, turd bird. lt's mine.

Hey! What's happening? For God's sake!

This is the newsroom typewriter.

Okay, dick licker, outside.

Parking lot.

l'm gonna rip your teeny tongue out. Come on.

Out!

Come on! Take it easy.

What's going on?

This greaseball tried to steal our typewriter.

My God! Are you okay, sir?

-Sir? Mr. Carmichael?
-All right, that's it. l'm out of here. l'm walking.

No. God, no.

He's fired. You're fired.

Get out of here! Out!

Hey! Come on!

You know who you just
nearly bludgeoned to death here, you lout?

This is the man
who has syndicated 127 stations.

This is Mr. Pedro Carmichael. Mr. Carmichael?

Do something, Martin.

Look, l'm really sorry, Mr. Carmichael.
l had no idea.

-l thought--
-Forget it.

l'm used to being misunderstood.

Pedro Carmichael, an American...

...an artist, a friend.

<i>On a sultry day in July, Dr. Albert Quince...</i>

<i>...eminent New Orleans socialite</i>
<i>and brain surgeon...</i>

<i>...travels to his niece Elena's</i>
<i>glittering wedding party.</i>

<i>As he approaches his brother Robert's</i>
<i>imposing Garden District mansion...</i>

<i>...he little realizes</i>
<i>what dark and terrible revelations...</i>

<i>...lie in store for him.</i>

-Thank you, Lewis.
-Yes, Mr. Quince.

Albert! Wonderful to see you!

Robert.

My, my. Some style, little brother.

Hi! Maybe l should have thought about
the extermination business myself. Hi!

ls this the wealthiest brain surgeon
in New Orleans speaking?

-Come on. Say hello to Margaret.
-Margaret!

-Who's my favorite brother-in-law?
-Yes. Wonderful day.

Yes. And l want you to say hello
to the world's best son-in-law!

Dr. Quince.

Elmore, you call me ''Uncle Albert.''
You're a very, very lucky boy.

Yeah. Thank you, sir.

-Speaking of which, where is your lovely bride?
-Elena was asking for you a while back, sir.

Very anxious to see you.

-That my favorite nephew? Excuse me.
-Sure enough.

Richard?

Good morning, son. How are you?

Where's your sister?
Elmore says she's looking for me.

How are you, Uncle Albert? She's upstairs.

Richard?

ls everything all right? You feeling okay?

-You want pop down to see me at the clinic?
-Look, l'm fine. Thank you.

Excuse me.

<i>What fearful shadow is haunting</i>
<i>the young and brilliant Richard?</i>

<i>Albert Quince can only wait and wonder...</i>

<i>...what else this day has in store.</i>

<i>Elmore and Elena...</i>

...l now pronounce you man and wife.

You may kiss your bride.

Richard? What's wrong with Elena?
She seems a trifle upset.

Not to worry, Uncle Albert. She'll be all right.

What's wrong with you, boy? You look like
an Albanian peasant whose cow just died.

Uncle Albert<i>....</i>

l<i>....</i>

l love Elena.

Yes, of course you do. We all do.

-But today we should be happy for her, not sad.
-No, you don't want to understand.

l do love her.

l do. But...

...not as a sister.

Richard, what are you talking about, boy?

''lt's true. l don't care.
l don't care who knows it.

''You've got to believe me.''

''Don't say one word more!
You're not well, my boy. You're not well!''

''l do not love her as a sister!''

''l don't understand!''

''l love her as a woman!''

<i>l love her as a woman</i>/

<i>Good Lord, boy</i>/

<i>lf the family should hear of this scandal....</i>

Sir?

Good morning, my friend.

Listen, l thought the serial...

...the soap, was extraordinary...

...original...

...so brave...

-...and uncompromising.
-Yes! Of course it was.

Four hours of production.

Time for a little refreshment, l believe.

Comin'?

So, anyway, l finally got up enough nerve.

Thank you, Charles.

What did you say this was?

lt's my own recipe. lt's a blend
of eucalyptus leaves and uncured tobacco.

lt tones up the mind...

...clears the synapses.

Try it.

God! Do you like it?

Hey...

...do bears do big pooty in the woods?

Anyway, you were saying?

l had a story published in the <i>Picayune.</i>

l'm not sure, l mean,
l'm studying to be a lawyer, but...

...l think l'd kind of like to be a writer.

You'd kind of like to be a writer?

Yeah.

He'd kind of like to be a writer.

lt's not the kind of job...

...you kind of like to have.

You're forced...

...compelled.

You got no choice, man.

-Yeah, well, l do feel like that.
-Us writers, Martin...

...can't afford to sit around.

We got to make reality impact.

Sei<i>z</i>e the opportunity.

Know what l mean?

l'm going to have the prime rib.

-Excellent, excellent choice.
-That's wonderful, darling.

Donald, that's got to be expensive.

You missed a great movie.

Yeah? What movie?

The one we were meant to go to together?

You didn't think l was<i>....</i> Yeah, you did.

You know, l was on a date. Another date.

With Brent?

Worse.

So, Brent, what do you think
you're going to have?

l think a little steamed flounder will be ample.

Good choice.

Hey, Olga, do they do lobster here?

Would you excuse me?
l'd like to tend to the call of nature.

Yeah. Sure.

-Come on, honey. Once around the dance floor.
-Luke.

Come on, you're not so old.

-Come on, Donald, Frances<i>. Allons dancer.</i>
-Come on, it's a slow one.

-You can handle that.
-Come on, Marty, dance with me, will you?

Quick, while the flounder's away
visiting the little boys'.

Aunt Julia?

-Drop the aunt stuff and raise your hands.
-Sure.

-Julia?
-Yeah?

l don't think, if you don't mind me saying this...

...l don't think you should be doing
this kind of thing, with all these old guys.

You're still quite young and okay-looking.

Thanks.

This Brent guy is just so dull!

Marty, l tell you something,
sometimes you'd be happy to settle for dull.

Nothing fancy, you know. No fancy ideas.
No more mistakes.

l'd like a dull man for a change.

Sort of boring.
With a heart condition. And rich.

Doesn't even have to be that good looking.

So, what happened to romance?

l got nothing against romance.

l'd just like, you know,
the deluxe version this time?

You know another good thing about dull men?

They won't proposition you every five seconds.

They won't always be trying to,
you know, do things with you.

What?

Sure.

You're not listening to me. Why?

Because...

...you look so beautiful tonight.

l mean it. Really great, you know?

Little Marty Loader. My God!

Will you give this ''Little Marty'' stuff a rest?
The name's Martin, okay?

Thank you, Martin, for the compliment.
lt is sweet.

l wonder what your father
would have said if he'd heard you.

l don't care.

l don't care what he thinks.

But dear Elena,
if the family should ever hear of this scandal<i>....</i>

l know, that's why l had to talk to you,
Uncle Albert.

There's only one course of action.
Put these notions out of your mind forever.

Elmore is a fine boy, a perfect choice.
Any other decision...

<i>...l can't bear to contemplate.</i>
<i>The blood would be in the cream...</i>

<i>...as those tight-fisted Albanian milkmaids</i>
<i>would put it.</i>

-But Uncle Albert, there's more, there's more!
-What?

l'm gonna have a baby!

<i>My dear. Stop worrying.</i>
<i>l can see you've been tormenting yourself.</i>

Tell Elmore an adjustment of documentation
is all that's necessary--

No, you don't understand.
lt's not Elmore's. lt's my brother's!

<i>lt's Richard's.</i>

l'm going to have my brother Richard's baby!

''l'm going to have my brother Richard's baby.''

Can we take a picture?

Yes, l'll<i>....</i>

''l do not love her as a sister.

''l love her as a woman!

''We are off to Toledo!''

-Hi, Martin.
-Hi, Nellie.

Where've you been all my life?

l've got to<i>....</i>

So<i>....</i>

-See you later, right?
-Right.

-Hi.
-Marty.

-Where's Aunt Olga?
-Out.

Right.

So, who says romance is dead?

Thank you.

That's really sweet of--

No.

That is not romance. That is commerce.

A bunch of flowers buys a kiss? No, mister.

-What got into you?
-What about the other night?

The other night, an aunt dances
with her nephew. Call the vice squad.

Firstly, you're not my aunt.

You're my father's brother's wife's sister.

-You've been studying.
-And secondly, l am not a total innocent.

l can read the signals.

l'm 21, and l lost my cherry five years ago.

Well, l'm 36, and l lost mine
almost before you were born.

Think about it. l mean it.

So what? You don't look 36.
You don't even look like an aunt.

Look<i>....</i>

l've done some really cra<i>z</i>y things in my life...

...but this is definitely
not going to be one of them.

-You want a beer?
-Sure.

That's what you men drink these days.

You could almost be my son, you know that?

So l've almost got an Oedipus complex.

Well?

What?

Do you want to go out with me?

-My God.
-No, listen, we could go to the movies.

Really? What do you kids do after?

-You go for an ice cream soda, l suppose?
-Sure.

-They got chocolate sauce?
-Lots.

You gonna give me the flowers or what?

-So what are you doing tomorrow night?
-l don't know.

What am l doing tomorrow night?

-l'm not sure a whole day's a good idea.
-Sure it is.

-l'm not sure you'll like me after a day.
-Sure l will.

-Wait. You got an eyelash.
-That's worth waiting for.

Make a wish.

-You got your wish.
-When?

-Can anybody see me?
-Nope. Nobody can see you.

Nobody could see you
even if they were lookin' to see you.

l got one! l got one, Julia!

Well, go on! Pull it in!

You got to play a fish.

-lt's got to be tired, that's the whole point.
-Tired?

What're you doing?

For God's sake, Julia, that's my best racket!

ls this tired enough for you?

<i>A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

Are they not the saddest words
you have ever, ever heard?

-She talked like that.
-Who?

Miss Blanche DuBois,
in <i>A Streetcar Named Desire...</i>

...by Mr. Tennessee Williams.

-See, you don't know everything, college boy.
-You could teach me what l don't know.

She was too old for him, anyway.

-You're still talking about Blanche?
-Yeah. She made a fool of herself...

...and then in the end,
they took her off to the loony bin, so there.

l'm going to write a book about you.

Yeah, about me?

Good!

l'll be good for something. Good.

<i>My Aunt Julia.</i> l'll call it <i>My Aunt Julia.</i>

l think you better change the name.

Maybe l will.

Maybe l won't.

Depends.

Depends...

...on what?

The fish is done.

<i>Okay, you've gone belly-up in shit's creek.</i>

<i>You need a paddle, real bad.</i>

What do you reach for?

Art!

That's what l'm talking about.

The very apex of your art!

l want to hear your sinews crack and strain.

l want your souls...

...to enter those microphones...

...and emerge like ghosts...

...in the homes of our listeners.

There's an army of them out there,
groping blindly...

...toiling in the darkness, waiting.

For what?

For you!

For your incandescent, brilliant...

...palpitating talent...

...to light up their miserable...

...impoverished, dull...

...and worthless lives!

Okay, gang, take five.

And then we'll hit it.

-Leonard, may l speak to you for a moment?
-Sure, Pedro.

What's up?

The key to your part, Leonard,
is you're in love, got it?

Madly in love.

You're in love so bad,
you can taste it in your mouth.

Yeah, that's what l'm feeling.

But l ain't hearing it, Len.

lt ain't coming across the airwaves,
know what l mean?

What l'm hearing is tired blood.
Ain't doing squat for me.

Jee<i>z,</i> Pedro, l<i>....</i>

-l'm doing my best.
-Okay, l got a trick for you, always works.

l want you to go to the can right now, okay?

Lock the door and jerk off.
Then come on out and do your lines.

-What?
-You know. Jerk off. Beat your meat.

Choke the chicken. Polish the rocket.
Manipulate the mango.

You've done it before, haven't you?

Yeah. Sure, lots of times.

What're you waiting for?
You got seven and a half minutes. Give it hell.

Yes, sir.

-Where're you going, Leonard?
-To the john.

-l gotta jerk off.
-Most amusing, Leonard.

Very droll.

Places, everybody.

After the shock of seeing his sister Elena,
who was carrying his child...

...marry Elmore Dubuque...

...Richard Quince flees his family home...

...to take Holy Orders
and work in a leper colony.

His anguished father, Robert, has sent for
the colony's priest, Father Serafim.

''Where had l gotten to, Miss Jones?''

''Albanians, sir.''

''Yes.

''This firm has a strict policy
of not employing Albanians.''

This is largely because of their
bestial sexual habits...

...and their practice of attendin'
to their calls of nature in a bucket...

...located in the same room they use...

...for eatin' and sleepin'.

Sincerely...

...Robert...

...E...

...Quince.

-Yes?
<i>-Father Serafim from the leper colony is here.</i>

Thank you.

Show him in, Gladys.

Father Serafim? He'll see you now.

-Father.
-Mr. Quince.

Father Serafim,
l believe my son Richard is with you?

Yes, sir. He works with us down at the mission.
A good boy.

Please go on, Father.

Well...

...as long as l live...

...l shall never forget the day
he arrived at the mission.

<i>He was like some poor battered ship...</i>

<i>...seekin' shelter from the storm.</i>

Father, will you give me...

...shelter from the storm?

<i>Since that day, he seems like a man...</i>

<i>...possessed.</i>

<i>He never stops working</i>
<i>for the sick or the needy.</i>

<i>He seems haunted, driven...</i>

...as if he's trying to escape...

...from some terrible, dark secret.

Life is strange!

What is it, my son? Tell me.

You see, Father...

...l never knew my father, Father.

When l was a boy...

<i>...my baby sister...</i>

<i>...was sleeping in her cot.</i>

<i>l was meant to be watching her.</i>

There were rats everywhere.

They were as hungry as we were!

<i>Since that day, Father, l vowed never...</i>

<i>...to relinquish the fight</i>
<i>against those disgusting vermin.</i>

<i>And Albanians, of course.</i>

Have you heard?
Father wants me to meet with him...

...and Father Serafim says l should.

-You must talk to him eventually.
-He'll take me away from you.

lt's hopeless. You can't hide here forever.

You've a brilliant career as a lawyer
yet ahead of you.

l'd rather be an Albanian goat salesman
than leave you.

-Richard--
-l love you!

-No, don't say that.
-l love you.

-Richard, you mustn't say--
-l love you.

-You mustn't say that.
-l do love you, l'll marry you.

That's hopeless. You're my brother!

What are we to do?

-What are we to do, Elena?
-l don't know, Richard!

Elena<i>....</i>

Let's leave here.
Let's live together as man and wife!

Not too bad, everybody.

We're coming along.

We're getting better. Slowly, but surely.

That was wonderful, wasn't it?

-All in a day's work.
-His rain was beautiful, wasn't it?

How was l, Pedro?

Good. You were good, Len.
That little trick worked?

l did it three times. Just to be on the safe side.

That's what l call a dedicated artist, Leonard.

A dedicated artist.

<i>l don't agree, l don't think it trivializes Paris.</i>

Because it was a romance.
l mean, romance can take place anywhere.

lt could be <i>An American in Detroit.</i>
lt doesn't matter where.

-l agree.
-Yeah, good. l like that.

lt's just that it's not a Paris
that l'm very interested in seeing.

l thought it was a lie.

l'm interested
in the Paris of Hemingway and Henry Miller.

l know what you're getting at.

You think all the great American writers
go to Paris, right?

-Well, yeah.
-Yeah.

Because all American writers go to Paris.

-Yeah?
-l'm telling you, Julia.

You stay in a little hotel on the Left Bank.

You go out in the morning
and have breakfast at La Palette.

You sit outside with a big cup of <i>café créme...</i>

...and a warm <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

You walk down Rue Bonaparte
and come out on the river.

The sun is shining on the water,
and the plane trees are going cra<i>z</i>y.

You look up to your right,
and there's Notre Dame and the lle St. Louis.

A cool bree<i>z</i>e is blowing. You fill your lungs.

And you are inspired.

You feel fantastic.

You can do anything.

-When were you there?
-l wasn't.

But l read all the right books.

Anyway, pretty soon it's time for an aperitif.
We walk down the Rue--

-l'm there, too, am l?
-Of course! Of course you are.

We stroll up to the Deux Magots.

We order <i>sandwichs au camembert</i>
and two Pernods.

That first taste of aniseed. The bread.

The cheese.

You and l.

And then we sip and we plan which little bistro
we're going to eat in tonight.

Shall we go to the Brasserie Lipp...

...or maybe down to Montparnasse
and the Closerie des Lilas?

Can we get the check?

-What did l do?
-Nothing. l just...

...you know, came back to reality, that's all.
Look, l got to go.

Hey, what's going on?

lt's called being rational, you know?
lt's called common sense.

-Common sense?
-Yeah, common sense.

Julia, you are the least commonsensical person
l have ever met!

Thanks a bunch. l got news for you.
l got big stocks of common sense.

l got a warehouse of common sense.

Boy, you got me.
l can't believe you really got me like that.

l'm sorry, l don't want to be the one
to pop your balloon, but--

lf l'm interrupting, please tell me.
Hate to be a buttinsky.

God. Hi, Pedro. No.

This is Julia Busquet, my aunt.

-Pedro Carmichael.
-Very pleased to meet you. l love your stuff.

l usually never listen
to that kind of garbage at all.

Excuse me, l have to go now. l'll see you soon...

...and it's nice to meet you, Mr. Carlton.

Carmichael!

Well, well, well, Martin.

Your aunt.

My God, l got to say that l'm impressed.

Really? You like her?

Does Pinocchio have wooden balls?

Sure l do. This is good, Martin. l'm pleased.

You know...

...l feel reality impacting here.

Believe me.

Listen, you want to stop and get a drink?
l'll think of what we should do next.

Sure.

Are you Pedro Carmichael?

-Who wants to know? Who are you?
-We're the people who kill children.

Yeah, they're the people who have
the cream covered in blood.

Are you gentlemen, by any chance...

...of Albanian ancestry,
if you don't mind my asking?

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

We are.

You got your head up your asses, dick lickers.

You scum-sucking Albanian douchebags.

Get the fuck out of my way!

Police! Help!

Quick, run! The cops!

Run, you ass-licking geeks!

Don't think l ain't gonna get you.

White-bone, chicken-shit faggot!

You too, doughboy. l've seen your face!

You boys are foreigners. You're finished!

You fart sucker. Moron. Degenerate.

Unfair to Albanians!
l will not eat, l will not sleep...

...until they ban Pedro Carmichael.

What are we gonna do, Martin?

What are we gonna do?

About what, Sid? Sam.

Sid.

About this damned Albanian crap. Sit down.

l tell you, Sam is way<i>....</i>

Sam is out of his box.
And l tell you this, Martin.

He's got to stop this anti-Albanian stuff.
lt's getting out of hand.

Quite apart from that spectacle outside...

...l've got 80 letters of complaint here.

And now it turns out
that the Mayor's wife is half Albanian.

l never reali<i>z</i>ed there were so many
friggin' Albanians in this burg.

And yet, all praise to the Good Lord...

...our audience is up...

...183% .

What the Sam Hill am l gonna do, Martin?
You tell me.

l don't know.
Tell him to go easy on the Albanian gags?

Go easy?

Go easy.

l figured<i>....</i> l mean, are they that important?

-Are they really worth bothering about?
-Yes.

Yes, Martin. Yes, they are.

Everybody's got to have something to hate.

Hate burns.

lt burns like love.

But why Albanians?

Why not?

The impact of reality.
Without that, the artist is nothin'.

-l promised l'd ask.
-That's what l like about you, Martin.

All that reality, impacting everywhere.

-lt is?
-You bet.

So, how are things going
with the beautiful Aunt Julia?

Not so good. She just won't take me seriously.

Hey, look, you got to<i>....</i> How l should l say it?

You got to get more sophisticated,
more chic, like the French do.

l'll tell you, l invite you and Julia
to my house for dinner.

That'd be my pleasure.

-All right.
-Leave everything to me.

-ls this the right address?
-l think so.

God, l'm glad l got my shots.

Hi. Nice to see you. Come on in.

Forgive the mess.

Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

Don't mind me. Just doing a little dusting.

Lord.

-Do you see that? Did you see it?
-Sure.

What's it saying to you?

Good help's hard to find?

That the room is dusty?

And you claim you want to be a writer.
No, Martin. Shallow.

That says 20 years of dusting...

...eight kids...

...and a husband that's a drunk and a bum!

Yeah. Yeah, l got you now.

You see, Martin, with these little gi<i>z</i>mos...

...l can sort of...

...become the characters l invent.
They become real.

Trick of the trade.
Anyway, listen, l'm sorry, but l forgot...

...l got to do something, l got to go out.
So it'll just be the two of you.

But it's all set up in the kitchen. Come along.

And l'll try and make it back for dessert.
Navarin of lamb, vichyssoise...

...new potatoes,
and a <i>sorbet au praline</i> in the icebox.

l think you'll find
the 1928 Chateau Latour precocious...

...but very drinkable.

Got to run.

<i>-Bonsoir, m'sieu et 'dame.</i>
<i>-Bonsoir, madame.</i>

<i>Mademoiselle?</i>

Here's to us.

-Julia?
-Boy, this is the real stuff.

-l've got to say something to you--
-Hold it. Hold it, don't move.

l think he followed me from New York.
What were you saying?

-Julia.
-Yeah?

These last weeks<i>....</i>
Well, l want you to know that...

-...l think l'm beginning to fall in love--
-Hold it.

-What?
-A bad attack of mood is what.

Just send home the violinist, will you?
Just turn up the lights.

God, you're obnoxious!
l don't know why l even bother!

Jesus!

-Why do you guys do this?
-Do what?

Why do you think
you have to be filthy to be sincere?

l'm sincere, not filthy.

You're sincere and you're poor,
it's the same difference.

Listen, if you're happy,
it doesn't matter how poor you are!

You fell for that one, too?

God, what am l doing?
Send for the men in the white coats!

l'll tell you, l don't know much.
l don't know if l'll ever be happy...

...but l sure as hell know
l'm never gonna be poor again.

Sounds great.

Real hard-boiled. Real mature.

So why don't l believe a word
that you're saying here?

-Listen, l know you, and this is not you!
-You know me, you college boy?

-You don't know anything about me.
-Listen!

You are not afraid of being poor!

-You just got afraid of being hurt, that's all.
-Smarten up. You got to get things straight.

You were a friend, you know?
For a while, l thought l had a real friend...

...and that was something l'd missed out on.

lt made me feel good for a while,
it made me feel 18 for a while...

...but that's<i>....</i> lt was just dumb.

l shouldn't have, you know?

You're a really sweet guy
and l don't want to hurt you.

-Please, believe me. l don't want to hurt you.
-Then don't.

You've got to face reality. lt's over, finished.

l mean it. Face it.
lt was never real to begin with.

<i>l don't want to hurt you, Elmore,</i>
<i>and l've never felt this way before, either...</i>

...but it's useless! lt's got no future.

Elmore, we've got to face it. lt can't go on.
l can't go on. lt's over.

We are finished!
For heaven's sakes, l am your mother-in-law!

But don't you see, Margaret?
That doesn't bother me. l don't care!

Darlin', we're not living in Albania.

<i>But Margaret, think about it from</i>
<i>an Albanian point of view. Our love.</i>

<i>That of a virile, handsome young man</i>
<i>for the maturely attractive mother...</i>

<i>...of his pregnant wife. lt's positively innocent</i>/

Hi, Martin. Come on in. Quickly.

l've just got to catch the end of the serial.
Make yourself at home. Can l get you anything?

l haven't seen Julia for a while...

...and l was wondering
if she wanted to go to a movie.

She's not here. Haven't you heard?
There's a new man on the scene.

No. l hadn't heard.

<i>...because you're my son-in-law...</i>

Who is he?

<i>...because you're married to my daughter...</i>

A Doctor Ted Orson.

He's a ladies' doctor.

A gynecologist.

Handsome. Very rich.
Lovely house in the Garden District.

Hey, isn't that great news?

<i>-...we mustn't go any further.</i>
<i>-You can't be serious</i>/

<i>We've got to face it, Elmore, it's over.</i>

l better get going.

l guess Aunt Julia's
too busy for the movies these days.

Bye.

-What?
<i>-All this is perfectly normal.</i>

-Sure l can't get you<i>....</i> Bye.
<i>-No</i>/ <i>lt's foreign, it's unnatural...</i>

<i>...it's incestuous</i>/ <i>lt's totally Albanian</i>/

Bug off, pus-face, or you die.

Mom!

Hello?

<i>-Martin?</i>
-Yeah.

<i>-Boy, are you sore?</i>
-Sore? Why should l be sore?

-You're free, you can do what you like.
-He is sore. Can l meet so l can explain?

What's there to explain
about a wealthy gynecologist?

Look, Ted Orson is a decent, kind...

<i>...successful--</i>

Hello, Martin?

-What's the matter, honey?
-Nothing.

Just my nephew.
He thinks he's madly in love with me, that's all.

God, l do love your sense of humor.

l probably shouldn't have told you. l'm sorry.

No, it's all right. Pardon me.

Nellie! Hi!

-l was just wondering if maybe tonight--
-Martin.

lf l never see you again, it'll be soon enough.

-Hey! What did l do?
-Go look in your office, you pervert!

Pedro. What was that about?

Women! God! You can't figure them.

Yes, why, thank you for callin'.
l'm so glad you're enjoying the show.

Okay. Get this.

Don't you ever hang up on me again. l hate that!

Sorry. Forgive me?

l'm so sorry that you hate it
when someone hangs up on you!

How truly horrible that must be for you!

But what about me?

You just hurt me
more than anyone has ever hurt me before.

l'm sorry if l hurt you, but you've got to back off.
You don't have a hold over me...

...and l don't remember asking
for all these judgments!

And thank you, by the way, for all this pressure.

That's just what l need!
Nothing like a lot of aggravation...

...for settin' you up for the day.
What? What are you looking at?

-You.
-So?

You look great when you're angry.

<i>And thank you...</i>

<i>...thank you so much for all this pressure.</i>

<i>You know, that's just what l need.</i>

<i>Nothing like a lot of aggravation</i>
<i>for settin' you up for the day.</i>

<i>-What? What are you looking at?</i>
<i>-You.</i>

<i>-So?</i>
<i>-You look great when you're angry.</i>

<i>-l don't believe it.</i>
-Bastard!

Why, Pedro?

Why?

-Why what?
-Why did you do it?

-Why did l do what?
-Why did you put what we said on the radio?

-Martin, my boy, let me ask you one question.
-What?

-What's more important, life or art?
-But it wasn't art!

You just copied word for word what we said!

And where did you get the words you used?

Your attitudes...

...the so-called feelings in your stupid heart?

From me, from us. Writers.

You feed on us! We feed on you.

Art isn't just some guy's name, you know.

Art is two cannibals on a desert island...

...dying of hunger. Eat or be eaten, Martin.
Name of the game.

Eat...

...or be eaten.

You don't have to say anything, son.
You made a simple mistake.

Could happen to anybody.
l'm used to being misunderstood.

And to show you l have no hard feelings...

...l bought you
and the beautiful Aunt Julia a gift.

-Nero Nero Club. For tonight?
-Have a wonderful time, Martin.

Show her a good time. Eat, drink.

Maybe a little<i>....</i> Who knows? Enjoy.

<i>Zie gesund.</i>

May l speak to Luke Loader, please?
Mr. Loader?

This is Cynthia,
Mr. O'Grady's secretary at WXBU.

Congratulations, sir.

You have just won two free tickets
to New Orleans' most exciting nightclub.

-Compliments from Mr. Carmichael.
-Boy!

Well.

Here's...

-...to Pedro.
-To Pedro.

Let's cut the rug. Come on.

Cut the rug?

Cut the rug.

No. Don't look.

Get us out of here fast!

Get us out of here!

Where are we?

Look.

-Do you think they saw us?
-l don't know.

You know what? l don't care!

l don't give a damn!

<i>Elmore, my darlin', terrible news</i>/

<i>-What, Margaret?</i>
<i>-The family have discovered our affair.</i>

<i>-They know everything</i>/
<i>-But how?</i>

<i>Well, you remember that evil, squintin',</i>
<i>unwashed Albanian stable boy...</i>

<i>...the one we call--</i>

So, are you still taking Julia to the movies?

Not so much these days. You know.

You should ask her again.
l think she'd like that.

Sure.

You gettin' on okay with her?

Yeah, l guess.

Yeah, l guess so.

That right?

l think you should call her up.
l think that'd be nice.

Hello?

<i>They know about us.</i>
<i>They told me this morning...</i>

<i>-...they're going to tell your parents tonight.</i>
-My God.

<i>l'm dead.</i>

l'm across the street.
l know they're watching me.

They called me a fallen woman.
Can you believe that?

l said to stick it up their ass.
They say we've got to stop seeing each other...

-...l've got to go back to New York.
<i>-What? You can't</i>/

<i>Look, l don't care, Julia.</i>
<i>l love you, for God's sakes</i>/

<i>-l don't care what they say</i>/
-Yeah, l told them that, too.

<i>-What? That l love you?</i>
-No. That l love you.

<i>You do?</i>

Yeah!

This is cra<i>z</i>y.

But l love you, too.

l am cra<i>z</i>y.

l guess it's just not in the cards.

<i>Martin? Are you all right? Are you crying?</i>

You make me sick.
You make me sick to my stomach.

l should beat the living shit out of you, boy,
only your mother begged me not to.

-When l think of you and that whore bitch, Julia!
-l love her!

l could run her in, you stupid<i>....</i>

l could book her
for corrupting the morals of a minor!

-Dad, l'm not a minor.
-Three years in the slammer, no trouble!

For the sake of your mother and the family,
l'm gonna leave her alone.

But you ain't ever going near her again.
She's leaving.

Luke and Olga are gonna throw her out.

l warn you, Martin. You see her once more...

...and l've got her up in front of a judge
on a morals bust as quick as a bunny.

You got it?

Yes, sir.

My God.

What a quandary.

My God, what a can of worms!

What to do, what to do.

Boy, there's a lot of reality impacting here.

Listen, Martin.

Tell me how you really feel
about your Aunt Julia.

Your strong personal feelings. Honestly.

Well<i>....</i>

l feel<i>....</i>

-l love her.
-l see.

-And have you told her that?
-Yes. Lots of times.

-And what did she say?
-She said she loved me, too.

Okay.

-And you do love her, really, truly?
-Sure! Sure, l do.

Then there's only one thing to do.

Martin, you got to fish or cut bait.

-l do.
-You got to get married.

Married?

-Wait here a second. lt won't be long.
-Pedro!

-You sure you know what you're doing?
-Can you clean your teeth?

Everything's under control.

So here we are.

Point of no return time, l would say.

Julia, it's the only way. What else can we do?

l could get out of the car and walk away, for one.

This isn't what l planned.

You know, you were supposed to be
65 years old with a heart condition.

l'm working on the last item.

God, you are so great, you know.

You're so beautiful.

Yeah, but for how long?

When l'm 50, you're going to be 35.

What will you do when l get
my hot flashes and my mood swings?

l'm serious. What am l gonna do?

Face it, l'm not always going to be so gorgeous
and beautiful and funny and sophisticated...

...as l am today, she said modestly.

You are.

Or you will be to me.

One day<i>....</i>

One day, you're gonna get tired of me.

Julia, what can l say? l love you!

l love you...

...and l think l'll always love you.

l can't say any more than that.

No one can.

Kiss me.

Okay.

Okay, what?

l'll tell you what l'll do.

l'll make a deal with you.

Five years. That's all l want. Just five.

You know, but it's got to be a deal.
You got to promise, okay?

Love me only for five years,
and then when you leave me...

...it won't be too late
for me to find another Ted Orson.

-Julia, don't.
-Five years. Promise me.

l promise.

No. Think about it.

Think what you're promising me.

l promise.

Okay. l take your promise.

But l'm only holding you to five years.
For five years...

...l'll do this totally cra<i>z</i>y, totally screwy thing!

The ring.

-Excuse me?
-Martin, the ring?

Sure!

Sorry.

Repeat after me.

With this ring...

...l thee<i>....</i>

Goodness. Excuse me.

...wed.

Martin, come on.

-Hi, Leonard.
-Come on, Martin.

No hard feelings.

What's going on? Who is this guy?

Take it easy, old boy. Take it easy.

Go easy, son. Just a misunderstanding.

lmpact of reality?

Calm down, son.

Wait till this impacts on your face!

l warned you.

-Hold him down, Leonard!
-lt was only a joke--

Shut up!

-l think we should talk about this.
-Let's talk about this? Come here!

Come on. Let's talk about it!

You can't hit him, Martin. He's a writer!

What's going on here?

l don't understand.
What do you think you're doing?

-Julia--
-No, no! Don't come near me.

l thought we had the best thing,
you know, best thing ever.

-Julia, please--
-Keep away.

lt was just that l thought it was so great,
you know. lt was great!

l'm so sorry.

Let go! lt's the only thing.
You got to let her go!

Get out of my way!

Julia! Wait!

Moose poop. How're we gonna get back now?

l've got my motorcycle. l could go for help.

-Where? Where is it?
-Don't hit! lt's right around there.

Wait. lt'll all turn out fine in the end.
lt always does.

Open the throttle.

-Trust me.
-Go to hell, Carmichael! Go to hell!

Elmore, stop, for God sakes.

You're driving like a
one-armed Albanian with crabs.

l'm beggin' you, stop!

Margaret! Don't you ever call me an--

lt was Pedro!

Please, stop!

lt wasn't me!

-lt was Pedro! l had nothing to do with that!
-Go away!

Julia! l had nothing to do with it. Stop!

<i>Julia, honey. Please, don't.</i>

Maybe if you apologi<i>z</i>ed to Luke...

...and in a week or so, if you got together
with Donald and Frances.

They're reasonable people
and if you promised not to see Martin--

Olga, stop. Stop, now.

l'm not going to apologi<i>z</i>e to anyone.

lt was all going so nicely.
And you've just ruined everything!

We thought you'd changed.
We really did, we thought at last you were...

...being practical about things.

But you haven't changed, have you?

You're still the same old Julia. Just wild.

And stubborn. And impossible.

You'll never grow up, will you?

No. l guess not.

Sorry, sis.

Hi, Martin. What's new?

Listen, bastard.

You've got to find Julia now and tell her
l had nothing to do with that cra<i>z</i>y stunt!

l did it already. l told her. She knows.

You did? You found her?
You know where she is?

What do you know? Speak of the devil.

lt wasn't me!

l had nothing to do with it, l swear.

-Everything l said to you was true.
-l can handle this myself.

-l love you, okay?
-Okay, fella. Easy.

-That's wrong. You're an idiot!
-Come on now.

-Listen, slimebag, back off!
-Okay.

You just don't understand.

What'd he do? He hit you in the nuts?
He gave you a cheap shot?

He hit you low, l saw that.
Gynecologist, what do you expect?

Take deep breaths.

Bitch!

That goddamn bitch of hell!

l just knew she'd go back to that bastard.

Can you believe that? Women.
God, make you sick.

l gotta do something.
l'm not gonna let this happen.

-l'm not gonna let this happen.
-You've got guts, kid.

You gotta show 'em to the lady.

You gotta find that doctor
and scare the shit out of him.

And l'll tell you exactly how to do it.

You got a gun?

Back off, you slimebags!

l got a gun.

Run, you ass-kissing geeks! l've seen your face.

You're finished! l tell you, man...

...you bought the farm!

You fart-sucking moral degenerate!

Corn-holing, dingbat, finger man!

Take it easy, sir. We'll get 'em.

There's a gang of Albanian deviants
terrori<i>z</i>ing the neighborhood.

Albanians! l should have known.
That particular smell!

That hangdog, cretinous look.

As you know, sir, they're breast-fed
up until the age of 10.

That's disgusting!

l would say that's a little generous, sir.
l'd say they were subhuman.

Son of a bitch.

Hot damn!
Those boys out there are red-assed as hell.

Where in God's name have you been?
The show starts in 10 minutes, for Christ's sake.

-Unfinished business, Sid. Very important.
-No, l am Sam.

-l thought you were Sid.
-Sam.

Whatever. There's a lot of 'em
out there, ain't there?

lt's got to stop.

They poured tar on my lawn yesterday,
then they set it on fire.

Yeah! They slashed the tires on Sid's car!

-l thought you said you were Sid.
-l'm Sam.

-Sid, l told you they're dangerous lunatics.
-Sam!

-Sid.
-Sam.

-Sid! You got to call the cops.
-No! That's not<i>....</i>

l had a call from
the Albanian Liberation Organi<i>z</i>ation.

Something real bad-ass nasty's gonna happen.
This guy says--

-Sid, they're bluffing. l know it.
-Sam!

Sid talked to those guys.

-Don't you mean Sam?
-No, Sid!

He met with their top people
and he made them promises.

And from now on, every script
has to be read and approved by Sam!

Then you are Sid.

No, no. l meant Sid.

No, l'm Sam. l must have meant Sid.

And he said, ''No more Albanian jokes.''

-Who said?
-Sid said.

-Sid said?
-Sid said!

-Sam said.
-So you are Sid.

No, l'm Sam! Pedro, l mean it!

They got us by the balls.

l mean, one in each hand.

Pedro, you write so good.

You don't need this Albanian crap.

Brilliant script.

Grade A quality. lsn't it, guys?

That's what we need.
Just the sort of stuff you do so well.

And thanks for dropping the Albanian stuff.
You know what they said?

One more joke, they'd torch the place.

Can you imagine?
l mean, where's their sense of humor?

They ain't got none.

Yeah? Yeah, that's why it's best
not to mess with them at all.

Excuse me, Sam. l...

...have to take a leak before we go on.

Yeah. Yeah, sure.

-We only got three minutes.
-We're behind you, Pedro.

-Yes.
-You bet!

We need you.

Thanks, guys. Thanks for everything.

And l'm behind you!

<i>-Hello, Martin. Can you get it?</i>
-Yeah, l can get it.

Listen, l found out where she's staying.

28 Chapelle. Yeah.

lt's Ted Orson's townhouse. Good luck, son.

That's that fire alarm.

You bastards.

You Albanian bastards.

This is an evacuation. Everybody evacuate!

Take your buddy's hand. This is not a drill!
Evacuate, please.

-l've got to get my brother Sid. Come with me.
-Open the doors.

We apologi<i>z</i>e for that short interruption.

A small technical hitch here at the studio.

And now we continue...

...with our enormously popular
nighttime serial...

<i>...Kings of the Garden District.</i>

<i>Elmore Dubuque, his young and fevered mind</i>
<i>driven to near madness...</i>

<i>...by his forbidden love</i>
<i>for his mother-in-law Margaret...</i>

<i>...contemplates desperate measures.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, for Dr. Albert Quince</i>
<i>in his storm-battered clinic...</i>

<i>...time is running out.</i>

Uncle Albert!

-More oxygen. Push, Elena, push.
-l'm only four months pregnant!

l know it's a little premature,
but our time is running out.

Uncle Albert, you're a brain surgeon,
for heaven's sake!

Don't worry about that now, girl. Push!

Elmore, thank God that awful car crash
was only a dream.

l want you.

l must have you.

Elmore, that is your wife lying there.

And my husband's just yards away.

l know that, honey. That's what excites me.

lt excites me, too.

Elmore<i>....</i>

Nurse, swab.

Wait a minute.
There's something strange going on here.

Who are you?

Richard!

Yes, Uncle Albert, it is l.

-Richard.
-Richard, darling.

This is my child.
l have a right to be present at its birth.

You swine!

Come on, Margaret. We're calling the police.

Richard, Uncle Albert is trying to induce me...

...even though l'm only four months pregnant.

You keep your filthy hands off her, you...

...gynecologist.

-This is madness.
-Albert.

l feel so ashamed.

My own son and daughter.

l can't stand to see my brother in so much pain.

-There's something l have to tell you.
-What is it, Albert?

Remember in '32, when you were
putting down the rat epidemic in Baton Rouge?

Yes.

Something happened between...

...Margaret and me.

Something beautiful.

Robert, Elena's not your daughter, she's mine.

Albert! No!

Margaret.

Not my daughter?

Richard! Darling! lsn't that wonderful?

That means we're cousins!

You'll always be a sister to me, Elena.

Verminous mongrel!

l always knew l couldn't trust you.

But now l know why!

l found this letter...

...written by my mother on her deathbed.

When you were a baby,
she found you in a beat-up crate...

...by the cesspool behind our hovel...

...in the slums of the Batture!

You are not my brother, Albert!

That's right, l am not
your brother Albert, Robert.

But l wrote that letter.

And your mother isn't dead.

Richard, we are not even cousins.

Free, free, free at last, my love.

Evening, everybody.
l got here as quick as l could.

Excuse me, sir.

There's an Albanian outside.

And he's doing something unnatural
to your German Shepherd.

<i>Leaving the Quince family</i>
<i>still numb with shock...</i>

<i>...the gallant policeman runs to a squalid alley...</i>

<i>...inhabited only by rats, garbage...</i>

<i>...and Albanians.</i>

Good Lord, man, what in the hell do you think
you're doin' to my dog?

Sorry, officer.
l saw your beautiful, strong Shepherd...

...and l have overpowering desire.

l love animal, all animal.

Dog, pig, goat...

...even chicken.

l love little fluffy chicken.

Good Lord above, man, that's no excuse.

What reason can you give for this abomination?

ls easy explanation, sir.

ls old Albanian custom to love animal
in such a way.

Break it down with the hatchet.

<i>Robert, no. What are you doing?</i>
<i>Put that gun away.</i>

<i>Take it easy, sir.</i>
<i>l've been watching you for days.</i>

<i>-l know everything. lt's disgustin'</i>/
<i>-Elmore, take the gun. Grab it</i>/

<i>Give me that gun</i>/

He killed him. Elmore, you killed my husband.

<i>of you being with another man.</i>

<i>Margaret, l love you.</i>

<i>Take your hands off me.</i>
<i>l hate you. l never want to see you again.</i>

<i>You're sick</i>/ <i>You're mad</i>/

Elmore, l beg you on my hands and knees.
You say you love me.

How can you kill me if you love me?

<i>Margaret, hate burns like love</i>/

<i>Love burns like hate.</i>

lt's because l love you that l'm doing this.

We all kill the thing we love.

You're such a real man.

Margaret.

My darlin'.

lt's better this way.

My God! What?

You scared me!

l had to see you.

l can't stand it, Julia.

l can't bear to be without you.

l can't bear it, either.

What the hell is that?

Damn!

-lt's a gun.
-Yeah, l can see it's a gun.

Pedro told me to bring it.
l was going to scare Orson.

l don't know.

l think l might've even shot myself.

Boy.

Where is Orson, anyway?

Ted? l don't know.

-But you were with him this afternoon.
-Yeah.

l was saying goodbye to him this afternoon.

-But you were staying at his house!
-No, Pedro found me a place to stay.

-Pedro?
-Yeah.

-But this is Orson's car, right?
-No.

lt's Pedro's car.

Pedro's car? Where you goin'?

The back seat.

There it is, the burned-out shell of WXBU...

...already looking like a relic from times past.

And your name, sir?

Big John Coot, Voice of New Orleans.
Everybody knows that.

His name's Pedro Carmichael. You just shoot
him on sight now, the minute you see him!

-Shoot him on sight!
-Sir?

Did you find his body yet?
lt's a little squidgy one, about that big.

No, sir, not yet. But we did find this.

ls it a clue?

My damn brother. l wonder where he got to.

Now you keep right on looking for Carmichael.

-Yes, sir.
-Carmichael!

You bastard!

l'm offering $500 for any part of his body,
no matter how small!

-Where did you learn to do that?
-Right here, last night.

Get out of town.

You know l can't live without you now,
don't you?

You're never going to have to.

Come here.

-Where we going?
-Come here. We're going right here.

-Come here.
-Yeah.

We are gonna make love one more time.

And then we're gonna pack our bags
and go away.

We're gonna get married.

-For real?
-For real.

Good.

-And l'm going to write. l'm gonna be a writer.
-l'm gonna be a singer.

You're gonna what?

l'm gonna be a singer.

-You can sing?
-Yes.

-When did you learn to sing?
-Right here, last night.

-No, no.
-Damn.

-lt's my father!
-Come on! Here.

-Where's your shirt?
-How you doin'?

l'm doing okay. Here are your shoes.

Come on, the blanket!

-What?
-Pull in the blanket!

Hi, guys.

That was a squeaker!

-What happened?
-You look weird.

lt got a little hot down there at the station.

-l don't know what the big idea is--
-l got to talk to you.

l got two do<i>z</i>en red-ass cops on my tail
that haven't got time for the story of my life!

-l don't understand--
-Ted Orson's car?

-You give a guy in love a gun?
-Ted Orson's house?

-l could have shot her!
-He could have shot me!

l see a lot of reality impacting here.
That's good. l like that.

Anyway...

...l got to haul ass.

Pedro! This time you are not gonna get--

Cardinal Peter Carmichael, l think.

Yes.

Yes, that would be good.

My goodness, darlin'. My goodness.

l had no idea you were here.

God love you, child.

And peace to you, too, son.

l want you to know...

...l haven't figured it out yet,
just exactly what you did, but l will.

Come on. Without me, you guys'd still
be holding hands in the movies.

l got to run. Goodbye, Julia.

Look after this little sapsucker, here.

-l'll try.
-Keep writing, son.

You remember what l told you.
Life is a shitstorm...

...and when it's raining shit...

...the best umbrella you can buy is art.

Damn right.

Wait a second, man. Where are you going?
What are you going to do?

New York. Television.

That's where the rubber
hits the road these days.

-Television? You're sure?
-What about the Albanians?

Albanians? What about 'em?

Fine outstanding race.

l love the Albanian people.

l'm half Albanian myself, for God's sake.

-You are?
-But the Norwegians, now...

...talk about depraved! God!

The things that they'll do.

lt'd make a maggot gag.

-Listen, l got to go.
-Wait a second, man!

What about you? Are you gonna be okay?

Am l gonna be okay?

Does a frog have a waterproof ass?

Yes!

Bye!

-Good luck.
-Thank you!

-Were you serious about your singing?
-l never joke about my singing. Why?

Well...

...the French love American songs.

Good. They're the only kind l know.

You'll sing at night, and l'll write.
And in the morning, we'll make love...

...and walk in the Bois de Boulogne,
and people will watch us walking together...

-...and they'll say--
-''He's too young for her.''

Julia, in Paris...

...all the women are older than the men.

Good for them.
