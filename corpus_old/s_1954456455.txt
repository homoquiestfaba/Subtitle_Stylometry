      LET'S GO THIS WAY.

            OH, NO!

            NO, NO.

          OH, PLEASE?

                   WE'RE CLOSED.

        HEY, HEY, HEY,
    WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

             FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,
             LET THAT GIRL IN.

   HERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART.

       OH, MY GOODNESS.
       OH, MY GOODNESS!

      THANK YOU SO MUCH.

OH, LOOK AT YOU.

               OH, MY GOODNESS.

            -STAY.
      -OH, THERE YOU GO.

            OH, YOU'RE WET, TOO.
            OH, DEAR.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

                 YOU'RE WELCOME,
                 SWEETHEART.

ARE DOGS EVEN
ALLOWED IN HERE?

                             NO.

    WELL, TECHNICALLY, NO,
     BUT SINCE IT'S AFTER
           HOURS...

                     AND, SO...
                     YOU LOOK--

LIKE SOMEONE
LOST A GROOM.

         IT'S KIND OF
     THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

  DO YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN?

KITCHEN'S CLOSED.

       YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
        BUT THE TABLES,

     THEY ARE STILL OPEN.

              OH, HONEY, YOU ARE
              JUST A MESS.

         I'M SO SORRY TO SAY IT,
         BUT YOU ARE A MESS.

    I'LL BET THERE IS JUST
      ONE HECK OF A STORY

    TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS.

THERE BETTER BE.

I DON'T RE-OPEN THIS
PLACE FOR ANYBODY.

        OH... [SCOFFS]

DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT HIM.

 HE IS ALL BARK, BUT NO BITE.

   IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.

    YOU KNOW, I WAS WALKING
  DOWN THE AISLE ONE MINUTE,

        AND THE NEXT...

LOUIE, HEY, HEY, HEY.

WHAT?

                  BABE, COME,
                  SIT, SIT, SIT.

        I THINK THIS IS
      GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

        OH, SWEETHEART.

   WHAT'S YOUR NAME, KIDDO?

            BAILEY.

         BAILEY DALEY.

           MUSICAL.

             YEAH.
   AND THIS IS ADAM, AND EVE

         AND SHIRLEY.

           [LAUGHS]
   YOU'RE KIDDING. SHIRLEY?

           SHIRLEY.

     WELL, HELLO, SHIRLEY.

HELLO, SWEETHEART.

     ALL RIGHT, BABY GIRL,

NOW, YOU START
AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

             AND DON'T LEAVE OUT
             ONE SINGLE THING.

           [LAUGHS]

          OKAY. UH...

    I GUESS IT ALL STARTED

  THE FIRST DAY I MOVED INTO
        MY NEW HOUSE...

             [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

     <i> I'D LOVED THE PLACE</i>
           <i> FOREVER,</i>

    <i> IT WAS MY LITTLE DREAM</i>
            <i> HOUSE.</i>

   <i> AND I SAVED UP MY MONEY</i>
     <i> FOR YEARS AND YEARS,</i>

       <i> JUST VOWING THAT</i>
    <i> IF IT EVER CAME ON THE</i>
           <i> MARKET,</i>

       <i> I WOULD BUY IT,</i>

<i>   AND, AT LONG LAST, I DID.</i>

                HONEY, I'M
                SO PROUD OF YOU.

             YOU HUNG IN THERE,
              YOU STUCK IT OUT,

               AND LOOK AT THIS,
               YOU MADE IT.

     WELL, IT DIDN'T HURT
   THAT YOU CO-SIGNED ON THE
             LOAN.

           YOU KNOW WHO WOULD'VE
           LOVED THIS PLACE?

             -WHO?
            -HOWIE.

OH, HOWIE.
BEAGLE EXTRAORDINAIRE.

YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING, SWEETIE.

MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU GET A NEW DOG.

I MEAN, THIS IS THE LONGEST

YOU'VE EVER BEEN
WITHOUT ONE.

                       TOO SOON.

                 WHEN IT'S TIME,
                 I'LL KNOW.

      AM I BEING A BABY?

  WHY, BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
   TO SPEND YOUR FIRST NIGHT

 ALL ALONE IN YOUR NEW HOUSE,
     WITH ONLY THE STRANGE
            NOISES?

            MAYBE.

OH, BALES,

A "TOTAL BABY"
DOESN'T BUY A HOUSE

        ALL ON HER OWN,

  TO LIVE IN AND TAKE CARE OF
        ALL BY HERSELF.

    SEE, THAT'S THE THING.

      IT'S A GREAT HOUSE,

       BUT I'M REALIZING
     IT'S A HOME FOR TWO.

           MEANING?

             MEANING I HAVE
             A JOB THAT I LOVE--

YES, YOUR STUDENTS ARE
CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

                   SO ARE YOURS.

        NOBODY'S CRAZY
  ABOUT THEIR FRENCH TEACHER,

 EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE FRENCH.


      I HAVE A GREAT MOM,

         I HAVE AN AWESOME BFF,

      GREAT NEW HOUSE....

        THE ONLY THING
      THAT'S MISSING IS--

A DOG, YES,

BUT LIKE YOU SAID,

YOU'LL KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

            A MAN!

   I'M TALKING ABOUT A MAN.

OH, ONE OF THOSE.

                           YEAH.

         DO YOU KNOW,

      THAT BETWEEN WORK,
        HOWIE PASSING,

             AND BUYING A HOUSE,

    I HAVEN'T DATED ANYONE
          SINCE RYAN?

      THAT WAS AGES AGO.

                         I KNOW.

     OKAY, YOU NEED TO GO
      AND GET BOY-CRAZY.

         NO, I DON'T.

    I NEED TO FIND MY GUY,
   MY PARTNER IN CRIME, YOU
             KNOW?

AW...

THERE'S THE BAILEY DALEY
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.

     [SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

         THE NEXT BOOK
      WE'RE GOING TO READ

     IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME
          FAVORITES,

        EMILY BRONTE'S
     "WUTHERING HEIGHTS."

       [CLASS GROANING]

        NO, NO, NO, NO,
    IT'S A VERY GOOD BOOK.

  BUT IT'S REALLY SAD, ISN'T
              IT?

           IN A WAY,

     BUT IT ALSO CONTAINS

      ONE OF LITERATURE'S
        MOST PASSIONATE

    AND THRILLING ROMANCES.

       HOW THRILLING CAN IT BE?

           IT TAKES PLACE, LIKE,
           A THOUSAND YEARS AGO!

MORE LIKE 200.

BUT IT'S NOT "WHEN"
THAT MATTERS,

IT'S THE STORY
THAT'S TIMELESS,

AND WHAT MAKES IT
SO THRILLING.

   CATHY AND HEATHCLIFF HAVE
   A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME LOVE

  AND IT'S WHAT WE ALL ASPIRE
              TO.

      EXCEPT FOR THE PART
    WHERE IT DESTROYS THEM

    AND EVERYONE THEY KNOW.

        OH, SOUNDS LIKE
  MY LAST THREE GIRLFRIENDS.

       AS THE GREAT POET
   ALFRED LORD TENNYSON ONCE
            WROTE,

         "'TIS BETTER
    TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST

   THAN NEVER TO HAVE LOVED
           AT ALL."

           DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
           THAT, MISS DALEY?

          YES, I DO.

             WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

            HOWIE.

  ONLY THE BEST BEAGLE EVER.

          [CHUCKLING]

             SO...

        EMILY BRONTE'S
     "WUTHERING HEIGHTS."

          OKAY, LASAGNA COULDN'T
          ALL OF A SUDDEN

        HAVE LESS CALORIES THAN
       BAKED CHICKEN, COULD IT?

YEAH, NOT
ON THIS PLANET.

          EARTH?

YEAH, THAT ONE.

                           MM...

            BUMMER.

   [SIGHING]

THANK YOU.

  YOU LADIES COME HERE OFTEN?

NOT OFTEN ENOUGH,
APPARENTLY.

               TRANSLATION--
               ARE YOU NEW HERE?

         WADE INGRAM,
    SUBSTITUTE GYM TEACHER.

               JUST FILLING IN
               FOR TERRY JANSSEN

              WHILE HE RECOVERS
             FROM BACK SURGERY.

        AND YOU ARE...?

UH, BAILEY DALEY.

            POETRY?

    ENGLISH.

COMP AND LIT.

AND THIS IS AMBER.

            FRENCH.

        I TEACH FRENCH,

I'M NOT FRENCH.

          [CHUCKLING]

           I GOT IT.

           CHICKEN?

    UH... BRAVE, ACTUALLY,
           KIND OF.

      I'M SOMEWHAT DARING
         OCCASIONALLY.

   I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR
             MEAL,
        BUT, YOU KNOW.

                 I, TOO, LIKE TO
                 ROLL THE DICE

    EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

     GOOD.

      [CELL PHONE CHIMES]

                     EXCUSE ME.

             OH...

    I'M SORRY, IT'S MY DAD,

         IT'S KIND OF A FANTASY
         FOOTBALL LEAGUE CRISIS.

               I SHOULD PROBABLY
               GET GOING,

   BUT I HOPE TO SEE YOU TWO
      AROUND MORE OFTEN.

    MAYBE GRAB A REAL MEAL
           SOMETIME.

           OH. OKAY.

          ALL RIGHT.

  ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE.

             YEAH.

          [CHUCKLING]

     SO, WHAT EXACTLY DOES
   "SHARE A REAL MEAL" MEAN?

I THINK IT MEANS
HE WANTS TO TAKE ME OUT,

DON'T YOU THINK?

        YEAH, THEN WHY DIDN'T HE
        JUST ASK YOU OUT?

I DON'T KNOW, MOM,
WE JUST MET.

          I COULD ASK HIM OUT
          IF I WANTED TO, RIGHT?

YEAH, WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO PLAY IT THAT WAY.

        AND BY THE WAY,
    IF I RECALL CORRECTLY,

      YOU ASKED DADDY OUT
  FOR THE FIRST TIME, DIDN'T
             YOU?

    OH, YOUR SWEET FATHER,

      SWEET, SHY FATHER,

      GOD REST HIS SOUL.

    YEAH, IF I DIDN'T MAKE
        THE FIRST MOVE,

       WE NEVER WOULD'VE
       GOTTEN TOGETHER.

WELL, LUCKY FOR ME
YOU DID.

BE THAT AS IT MAY,

THIS WADE FELLOW,
FROM WHAT YOU TELL ME,

WILL DEFINITELY LET YOU KNOW
IF HE IS INTERESTED.

  NOW, CHECK OUT THIS TABLE.

DEFINITELY
WORTH 75 CENTS.

                  WHAT ARE YOU
                  TALKING ABOUT?

               THIS IS A DIAMOND
               IN THE ROUGH.

I SEE THE "ROUGH" PART.

         [SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION]

GRAB ONE END.

           OKAY, GOING THIS WAY?

             -YES.
            -OKAY.

   [AMBER]:<i> YOU'RE WORKING?</i>

   BUT IT'S SUNDAY FUN-DAY.

<i>  I KNOW IT'S SUNDAY FUN-DAY,</i>

     BUT IF I DON'T FINISH
     GRADING THESE PAPERS,

         NEXT WEEKEND.

              NO!

   BALES, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

     I LEFT HALF THE TESTS

     YEAH, CAN'T YOU TELL

             OKAY.

        BEFORE OR AFTER
       THE "REAL MEAL"?

         UM... WELL...

  SHE LIKES TO COOK ITALIAN,

AND WATCH SAPPY MOVIES,

         AND HANG OUT

            FRANCE.

MM-HMM.

   THIS ISIAH THOMAS B-BALL.

   I GOT IT FOR EIGHT BUCKS.

         I WENT ONLINE, FOUND

     CAN YOU PUT IT UP FOR
           SAVINGS?

           [LAUGHS]

    YOU REALLY NEED TO MEET
          MY MOTHER.

         I'D LOVE TO.

                GUESS HOW MUCH
                SHE PAID FOR IT.

    25?

                        12.

            -WHAT?
            -YEAH.

   THAT IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT
          IN ITSELF.

WELL, SHE HELD UP

                     WHOA, HEY!

               WHAT'S GOING ON?

           WHY ARE YOU STOPPING?

IT'S JUST FOR FUN,

JUST FOR FUN...

      WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,
      BUT IF WE COMPLETELY STOP,

          THEN WE HAVE NO CHANCE
          OF WINNING AT ALL.

                     YEAH?

     OKAY.

             -GO?
           -HIT IT!

                      YEAH!

                   YOU GOT THIS.

             OKAY.

             [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

TALK ABOUT
AN UPHILL BATTLE.

            YEAH, IT'S JUST FOR
           THIS LITTLE STRETCH.

             YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

I'M DOING GREAT.

                 YEAH, YOU ARE.


              OH!

           [WINCING]

             WADE!

             YEAH?

             WADE!

             WHAT?

          I HOPE I DIDN'T
          RUIN THE RACE FOR YOU.

OH, NO. NO, I MEAN,
NO WORRIES,

AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY.

           ARE YOU?
         ARE YOU OKAY?

          I THINK SO.

  OKAY, THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

 DO YOU WANT TO TRY STANDING?

                           OKAY.

             GOOD.

                      YAY!

                     [LAUGHING]

             YOU SHOULD BE FINE,

JUST GO EASY ON IT
FOR A WHILE.

                      OKAY.

           RIGHT ON.

   SO, YOU WANNA FINISH THE
             RACE?

       I'M JUST KIDDING.

        BUT, SERIOUSLY,
   YOU MIND IF I FINISH IT?

              OH.

             OKAY.

                           UM...

    YEAH, I'LL BE... HERE.

      MEET ME BACK HERE?

             YEAH.

YEAH, UM...

                   I'LL BE HERE.

YOU'RE THE BEST.

                         THANKS.

AND YOU...

     YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER.

     THANKS, UM, BUT, UH,
    I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.

        YEAH, YOU WERE.

                       [GIGGLES]

             UM...

               YOU SURE
               YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

YEAH, I'M TOTALLY FINE.

I'M JUST SORRY I COULDN'T
RUN THAT LAST "K."

            YOU'RE A GOOD SPORT,
            YOU KNOW THAT?

                     SO, LISTEN,

       I'VE KIND OF GOT
   A HUGE FAVOR TO ASK YOU.

      I'VE GOT TO GO AWAY
         THIS WEEKEND

           FOR THIS
    BACHELOR PARTY THING--

      WAIT, THIS WEEKEND?

     YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT?

      WE PLANNED TO DRIVE
         TO THE BEACH.

             I TOTALLY SPACED
             ON THE VEGAS THING.

      ANYHOW, I WAS JUST
          WONDERING,

        MAYBE YOU COULD
      WATCH ADAM FOR ME?

                           HMM?

        YOU KNOW ADAM'S
      AS CRAZY ABOUT YOU

        AS I AM, RIGHT?

      YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SAY "NO"
      ONCE IN A WHILE.

          IT MAKES THE "YES"'S
          ALL THAT MUCH SWEETER.

SAY "NO" TO WHAT?

                 I JUST, I THINK

                 YOU DON'T NEED
                 TO TRY SO HARD.

             I MEAN, AFTER ALL,

        IT DIDN'T STOP WADE
        FROM LEAVING YOU BEHIND,

               WITH A BUM ANKLE,
               AND A DOG.

[GASPING IN DELIGHT]

                           WHAT?

        DOG ADOPTIONS!

                   NO. PUPPIES?

             I WANT EVERY
             SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

             I WANT TO TAKE YOU

           OH, YEAH.

WHAT'S YOUR DOG'S NAME?

           OH, UH, THIS IS ADAM.

         HE'S ACTUALLY
      MY BOYFRIEND'S DOG.

     IS ADAM IN THE MARKET
   FOR A BROTHER OR SISTER?

             YES.

                     YOU KNOW...

  YEAH, MAYBE, NOT RIGHT NOW.

WELL, WHEN YOU'RE--
ADAM'S READY--

COME ON BACK.

DOG ADOPTIONS
ARE EVERY SATURDAY.

             OKAY.

  I WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP IT.

     THANKS FOR COMING IN.

           YOU BET.
       NICE TO MEET YOU.

           YOU TOO.

    LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
    LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

OKAY...

                     [CHUCKLING]


             OH, YOU'LL BE BACK.

MOM, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

                       WHAT?

               I'M TALKING ABOUT
               TO ADOPT A DOG

                   WHEN THE TIME
                   IS RIGHT.

YUP, I WILL BE BACK

                     [CHUCKLING]

[CLEARS THROAT
AND SIGHS]

      OH, YOU WANT SOME?

          [CHUCKLING]

    YOU MISS YOUR DAD, HUH?

       WELL, I CAN'T SAY
         I BLAME YOU.

   I JUST HOPE HE MISSES US.

            MM-HMM.

       YOU KNOW, I HAVE
    AN OBSERVATION TO MAKE

        ABOUT YOUR DAD.

       ON THE ONE HAND,
   HE'S SWEET, AND HE'S FUN,

      AND HE'S ADORABLE.

         ON THE OTHER,

    EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE
    HE'S PAYING ATTENTION,

           HE'S NOT.

    IT'S LIKE HE'S WAITING
 FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO SHOW UP.

            I KNOW.

      AS LONG AS THERE'S
      FOOD IN YOUR BOWL,

        WHO CARES, HUH?

                     THANK YOU.

     I SO WANT TO KISS YOU

    OH, I THINK MAYBE NOT.

       MY ANKLE IS STILL
        A LITTLE WEIRD.

                 [GIGGLING] HI.

        HOW YOU DOING?

                    I'M WELL.
                    HOW ARE YOU?

I WAS LOOKING
FOR SOME ICE.

                     [CHATTING]

       SO, SEATTLE, HUH?

    I HEARD IT'S PRETTY RAD
            THERE,
           ACTUALLY.

                  I KNOW,
                  IT'S FREEZING,

  BUT MY GIRLFRIEND OPENED UP
      A NEW DANCE STUDIO,

    SO I FIGURED, I WANT TO
    HELP HER OUT, YOU KNOW?

   BESIDES, I HAVEN'T REALLY
      MET ANYONE SPECIAL

                   TO KEEP ME
                   AROUND HERE--

            WADE...

          BALES, HEY.

          AND SUSIE.

      UH, BAILEY, SUSIE.
        SUSIE, BAILEY.

   SERIOUSLY?

I'M WAITING FOR YOU
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
DOING?

YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH
"RUNNER-UP" OVER HERE?

               UH, I SHOULD GO.

YEAH, SORRY,
YOU SHOULD GO.

     WE WERE JUST TALKING.

   YOU'RE SO OVERREACTING ON
             THIS.

     I'M NOT OVERREACTING.

YOU FLIRT WITH EVERYONE.

YOU THINK I DIDN'T
NOTICE THAT, BUT I DID.

            AMBER.

   AND THAT NURSE AT THE 5K,
       YOU MADE HER DAY.

 OKAY, SO I'M A FRIENDLY GUY.

    YOUR DOG IS "FRIENDLY."

       YOU ARE A PLAYER.

      AND I DON'T WANT TO
         PLAY ANYMORE.

  CAN I GET BY HERE, PLEASE?

                     [WINCING]

BAILEY, HEY.

                          HI.

I SAW WHAT
HAPPENED THERE.

I GOT SOME FROZEN PEAS.

             OH. PET STORE GUY.

            -YEAH.
             -HI.

             -HEY.
       -THANK YOU. OKAY.

PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

           [WINCING]

       AND THE THING IS,

       IT WAS JUST NICE
    TO BE DATING AGAIN, YOU
             KNOW,

               AND, I CAN'T LIE,

                    HE WAS EASY
                   ON THE EYES.

                  AND I LOVE
                  HIS DOG, ADAM.

           HIS DOG IS SO GREAT.

    HE'S SUCH A SWEET GUY.

     OKAY, THIS IS BORING.

        NO, NOT AT ALL.

               [LAUGHING] OKAY.

              YOU KNOW WHAT
              I LOVE ABOUT DOGS?

       NOT JUST THAT THEY DON'T
       TALK BACK, THERE'S THAT,

      BUT THAT THEY'RE SO
          ACCEPTING.

      THEY'RE SO CAPABLE
  OF THAT UNCONDITIONAL LOVE

             THAT'S KIND OF
             A SUPERHUMAN TRAIT,

                       YOU KNOW?

         MY MOM SAYS,

    "IF YOU CAN FIND A MAN
 WHO CAN LOVE YOU LIKE A DOG,

      YOU WILL HAVE FOUND
          TRUE LOVE,"

     WHICH IS... MAYBE WHY
    SHE HASN'T FOUND ANYONE

        IN THE 10 YEARS
    SINCE MY DAD HAS DIED.

  ALL RIGHT, I'M SHUTTING UP.
          THANK YOU.

  I REALLY FEEL MUCH BETTER,
          SO THANKS.

       HEY, NO PROBLEM.

       YOU EVER SEE THAT
     WADE CHARACTER AGAIN?

                       [GROANS]

    AT SCHOOL A FEW TIMES,
   BUT I PRETTY MUCH IGNORED
             HIM.

    I TRIED IGNORING LOUIE
           FOREVER,

            BUT I STILL COULDN'T
            GET RID OF HIM.

      OH, SO YOU TWO...?

MM-HMM,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

           31 YEARS,

ROCKIN' AND SOCKIN'.

YEAH, LIFE'S FULL OF
CRAZY SURPRISES.

   YEAH, WELL, THE OPERATIVE
             WORD
       THERE IS "CRAZY."

    YOU NEED TO FINISH YOUR
            STORY.

            OKAY, SO ABOUT
            A MONTH OR SO LATER,

    I GET A CALL FROM WADE.

      YEAH, SO, YOU KNOW,
 TERRY JANSSEN'S COMING BACK,

         MY GIG IS UP,
       AND I'M THINKING,

        "HEY, YOU KNOW,
      MAYBE IT'S A SIGN,

       "MAYBE IT'S TIME
      TO SHAKE THINGS UP.

      MOVE SOMEWHERE NEW,
         START OVER."

       WHAT'S HER NAME?

            SUSIE.

       WAIT, "RUNNER-UP"
        FROM THE PARTY?

    YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S HER.

   "KILL ME NOW," SHE SAID.

     OH, SUSIE'S ACTUALLY
      A REALLY NICE GIRL,

        AND SHE THOUGHT
  THAT YOU WERE VERY PRETTY.

     REMIND ME TO SEND HER
       A THANK YOU NOTE.

     ANYWAY, SHE'S MOVING
          TO SEATTLE,

    AND I'M GOING WITH HER,
      SO I FIGURE, "HEY,

        THEY TEACH GYM
      EVERYWHERE, RIGHT?"

    IS GYM REALLY SOMETHING
          YOU TEACH,

         OR IS IT MORE
     JUST A STATE OF MIND?

    ANYWAY, SUSIE'S GETTING
         AN APARTMENT,

      THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED
      TO HAVE PETS THERE,

    AND I THOUGHT, YEAH, I
            DIDN'T
  WANT TO SHOW UP WITH ADAM,

YOU KNOW, AND IT BE
ALL AWKWARD, SO--

         SAY NO MORE.

    I'M HAPPY TO ADOPT HIM.

             YES.

        ALL RIGHT, BUD.

THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME, 'KAY?

           COME ON.

                           SEE?

             GIVE ME HIS STUFF.

       THANK YOU, BALES.

     I KNEW YOU'D SAY YES.

   YEAH, OF COURSE, YOU DID.

             BYE.

AND THAT IS
HOW I GOT ADAM,

         THE FIRST OF
  THE THREE LOVES OF MY LIFE.

BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN
HOW YOU ENDED UP HERE,

        IN THAT DRESS,

     ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS?

     PLEASE, LOUIE, GEEZ,

        WOULD YOU JUST
     LET THE GIRL FINISH?

 SORRY, BAILEY, YOU GO AHEAD.

        [CLEARS THROAT]

  WELL, AS GREAT AS ADAM WAS,

       HE CLEARLY NEEDED
       SOME DISCIPLINE.

              MM.

          ADAM, DOWN.

         BUDDY. ADAM.

           GET DOWN.

        SOMEBODY'S GOT
      A MIND OF HIS OWN.

  YEAH, HE JUST HAS TO LEARN

       HE CAN'T GO AFTER
      EVERYTHING HE SEES.

   KIND OF LIKE HIS EX-DAD.

             YEAH.

                           YEAH.

              OH.

           ACTUALLY,
   EXACTLY LIKE HIS EX-DAD.

                     [CHUCKLING]

                           ADAM!

      [LAUGHING] OH, WOW.

                             HI.

                   THIS IS ADAM.

                 COME ON, BUDDY,
                 COME HERE.

OH, WOW.

                         THANKS.

YOU KNOW, BALES,
 I'VE GOTTA SAY,

I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
WADE WAS FOR YOU.

                     YEAH. OKAY.

              I KNOW, BUT
              I LEARNED FROM IT.

    WHAT?

            THAT FUN AND CUTE
            IS NOT ALL THERE IS.

                 THAT, YOU KNOW,

             HONESTY AND LOYALTY
             COME FIRST.

         AND, WHILE WE'RE AT IT,

     MAYBE A LITTLE MORE DEPTH,

       A LITTLE MORE INTELLECT.

      WELL, I WAS INVITED
 TO AN ART OPENING NEXT WEEK.

TRAVIS IS COMING.

SHOULD BE CRAWLING

     WITH THE DEEP AND THE
            BRAINY.

WE SHOULD GO.

          OKAY, GOOD.

             WHICH ONE'S
             YOUR FAVORITE HERE?

OH, UM, YEAH,
I DON'T KNOW.

THEY'RE ALL
PRETTY UNIQUE.

               UM, WHAT'S YOURS?

WELL, SINCE
I'M A STRICT DISCIPLE

                OF BOTH ABSTRACT
                EXPRESSIONISM

         AND FANTASTIC REALISM,

         I PREFER THE INK WASHES
         AND MEZZOTINTS.

                        YOU?

                WHO WANTS
               CHAMPAGNE?

            I'M IN.

 IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
FOR JUST ONE MOMENT.

[CLEARS THROAT]

THANK YOU.

                 THAT WAS FAST.

HMM...

I WANT SOMEONE SMART,
NOT INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

DID YOU HEAR THAT?

         THAT'S FUNNY,
  BECAUSE, NORMALLY, IT'S MEN

      WHO FIND THAT WOMEN
    ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

              MAYBE IF THEY JUST
              PAID ATTENTION.

   IS THAT A CRACK ABOUT US
     NOT GETTING MARRIED,

       BECAUSE IF IT IS,
      I KEEP TELLING YOU,

      IF IT'S NOT BROKEN,
         WHY BREAK IT?

HOW-HOW TO--

                           SEE?

        IT MAKES SENSE.

                           YEAH.

I HOPE THAT'S
RHETORICAL,

AND ON BEHALF OF WOMEN
EVERYWHERE--

             LIKE WHAT YOU SEE?

          UM... YES.

      I LIKE YOUR SCARF?

               [LAUGHS] THANKS.

           BUT I MEANT THE ART.

          I'M SO GLAD
      YOU MEANT THE ART.

           [LAUGHS]

       UM, THE ART IS...

      UH, WHAT'S THE WORD
            FOR IT?

                   PRETENTIOUS?

     OH, THAT MIGHT WORK.

             YEAH.

      ARE YOU AN ARTIST?

                YES, UH, BUT NOT
                THIS KIND.

           WORDS ARE MY CANVAS.

OH, A WRITER. MM-HMM.

       PLAYWRIGHT, TO BE EXACT.

     MM-HMM.

              I'M JONATHAN.
              JONATHAN MITCHELL.

BAILEY.
BAILEY DALEY.

               HOW ALLITERATIVE.

UM... NO, THAT WOULD BE
"BAILEY BALEY."

                     YES...

OR "DAILEY DALEY."

                    ...IDIOT.

NO, NO, I'M SO SORRY.

I'M AN ENGLISH
TEACHER, SO...

             AN ENGLISH TEACHER?

YEAH.
[CLEARS THROAT]

                   LISTEN, UH...

           I NEED TO GET BACK
           TO MY FRIENDS, BUT...

OKAY.

       ARE YOU KIDDING?

        I-I LOVE JAZZ.

      I'M A JAZZ... NUT.

                    YEAH?

    YEAH.

                SUPERB.

   DO YOU WANT TO CATCH THE
             SHOW
        ON FRIDAY NIGHT

        AT THE BAKERY?

       I WOULD LOVE TO.

         WHICH BAKERY?

  Y-YOU KNOW, "THE" BAKERY--

       THE JAZZ BAKERY.

     OH. YES, THE JAZZ...
       CLUB THAT I LOVE.

                   ON CRESCENT.

             YES.

   THE SHOW STARTS AT 9:00.

OKAY.

      FRIDAY NIGHT, THEN.

FRIDAY NIGHT, THEN.

       [SQUEAKING IN EXCITEMENT]

    YES.

SO, I ALSO NEED TO LEARN
EVERYTHING I CAN ABOUT JAZZ

BETWEEN NOW AND FRIDAY.

                     YEAH. JAZZ.

MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

                       JAZZ NUT.

        YOU HEARD THAT?

          [LAUGHING]

WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING?

MILES DAVIS, STAN GETZ,
DAVE BRUBECK?

WHEN DID YOU BECOME
A FAN OF JAZZ?

                       JUST NOW.

  IT'S A LITTLE CRASH COURSE
      BEFORE MY DATE WITH
           JONATHAN.

            I SEE.

  WHAT WILL YOU PLAY THEM ON,
   YOUR IMAGINARY TURNTABLE?

          OKAY, SO...

  IT'S KIND OF JUST FOR SHOW.

               I JUST, I WANT TO
               HAVE THEM.

       IT'S VERY HIP AND
         INTELLIGENT.

WELL, IN CASE
YOU FORGOT,

        YOU'RE ALREADY
   A VERY INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

           YES, MOM.

             YOU TELL ME TO BE
             OPEN TO NEW THINGS?

         I'M OPEN TO NEW THINGS.

                         JAZZ!

MM-HMM.

JOHN COLTRANE,

IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO IMPRESS HIM.

      OH, LISTEN TO YOU.

      [CHUCKLES RUEFULLY]
     OH, I WISH YOU WOULD.

    WOW! THAT WAS SUBLIME.

                       YEAH.

YOU KNOW, I DON'T
MEET MANY WOMEN

THAT ARE INTO JAZZ.

           I DON'T MEET MANY MEN

             WHO USE
             THE WORD "SUBLIME."

YOU WANT TO GO
SOMEWHERE FOR A DRINK?

                       SURE.

OKAY.

          AND... GO.

             WHOA!

                GOOD BOY.
                WELL DONE, MATE.

WOW, YOU TWO
ARE GETTING ALONG.

DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY, THOUGH,

HE LIKES EVERYONE.

           ADAM SHOULD MEET EVE.

      UH, METAPHORICALLY
           SPEAKING?

                       NO, EVE.

                         MY DOG.

   YOU HAVE A DOG NAMED EVE?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?

WELL, CHEERS

       TO ADAM AND EVE.

            CHEERS.


      SHE'S A GOOD GIRL.

EVE CAN BE
A BIT MOODY.

         KIND OF GOES
    HER OWN WAY, YOU KNOW?

    WELL, I ADORE ALL DOGS,
   SO I'M HAPPY TO MEET HER.

                  [CLEARS THROAT
                  AWKWARDLY]

MILES, BRUBECK,

           COLTRANE.

CLASSIC.

           [LAUGHS]

     YEAH. I MEAN, RIGHT?

    IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY
            BETTER.

     AND ON VINYL NO LESS.

          VERY COOL.

    WHERE'S YOUR TURNTABLE?

    LET'S GIVE THEM A SPIN.

   UM, MY, UH, TURNTABLE...

   JUST COMPLETELY DIED LAST
             WEEK.

       IT'S BEING FIXED.

      AH, WELL, A SHAME.

ANOTHER TIME.

             YEAH.

           SALINGER,

BRONTE, DICKENS...

       YES, AS YOU KNOW,
   I TEACH LITERATURE, SO...

VERY COOL.

                     [CHUCKLES]

 BUT I KIND OF DIG
THE TOUGHER STUFF,

THOMAS PYNCHON,
JAMES JOYCE,

        MARCEL PROUST.

TALK ABOUT DEEP.

           SO DEEP.

  YOU'VE READ PROUST, RIGHT?

WHAT AM I SAYING?

YOU TEACH LITERATURE.

OF COURSE, YOU HAVE.

I'M ACHING TO KNOW
WHERE YOU STAND

ON "IN SEARCH OF
LOST TIME."

       IT'S SUCH A HUGE
         CONVERSATION.

       WHY DON'T WE JUST
    SAVE IT FOR NEXT TIME?

            PROUST?

YOU'RE KIDDING.

         IT'S AMAZING.

        I CAN'T BELIEVE
  I'VE NEVER READ IT BEFORE.

             HMM.

          PAGE FIVE.

         YOU'RE REALLY
      RIPPING THROUGH IT.

     IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
           IMPORTANT
        LITERARY WORKS

    OF THE 20th CENTURY, SO
            I'M...

      SAID THE TALL, HOT
          PLAYWRIGHT
    WITH THE DREAMY ACCENT.

           HE'S ALSO
     A REALLY GOOD KISSER.

             HMM.

         KEEP READING.


              OH!

   I WANT TO INVITE JONATHAN
         OVER TO MOM'S

      FOR SUNDAY DINNER.

             YOU AND TRAVIS
             WILL BE THERE, YES?

        DON'T YOU THINK
     YOU SHOULD GO THROUGH

  A FEW MORE CHAPTERS FIRST?

AND I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE BOOK.

         IT'LL BE FUN.

        I JUST WANT HIM
       TO MEET YOU GUYS.

             OKAY.

             'KAY.

YOU ALL RIGHT?

             YEAH.

           I'M JUST
       A LITTLE WORRIED

       ABOUT THE ENDING
        OF MY NEW PLAY.

    DOES IT WORK? NOT WORK?

       I MEAN, THE REST
       IS PRETTY GREAT,

  EVEN IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

           [LAUGHS]

  WELL, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
   IF YOU'D LET ME READ IT.

    THANKS, BUT I'D RATHER
      YOU HEARD IT FRESH.

 YOU KNOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME
  AT THE STAGED READING NEXT
             WEEK.

     IT'S A WRITER THING.

          OKAY, WELL,
   I'M SURE IT'S BRILLIANT,

     INCLUDING THE ENDING.

           WELL, HERE'S HOPING.


                   HEY, SPEAKING
                   OF BRILLIANT,

            ARE YOU READY
            TO RAP ABOUT PROUST?

YOU KNOW, I AM RE-READING
"IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME,"

AND... [SIGHS]
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

   WHICH VOLUME ARE YOU ON?

          THE FIRST.

             OKAY.

 OKAY, WELL, WE'LL WAIT UNTIL
  YOU'VE REVISITED ALL SEVEN,

   AND THEN WE'LL GO AT IT,

    YOU KNOW, PAGE BY PAGE.

   [CLEARS THROAT AWKWARDLY]

       WOULD YOU LIKE TO
     COME OVER FOR DINNER

 AT MY MOM'S HOUSE ON SUNDAY?

 IT'S KIND OF A WEEKLY RITUAL
       WITH MY FRIENDS.

AND I WANT
TO MEET EVE.

UNLESS YOU HAVE PLANS.
IT'S...

  I'M NOT ALL THAT BIG ON...

                         RITUAL.

         BUT, SURE...

          [CHUCKLES]

            IF IT MEANS SPENDING
            IT WITH YOU.

OKAY, GOOD.

ADAM AND EVE
SURE ARE GETTING ALONG.

           JONATHAN, HOW DO YOU
           LIKE YOUR ROAST BEEF,

                 MEDIUM OR RARE?

        MOM, JONATHAN'S
          VEGETARIAN.

              OH.

                 YOU KNOW WHAT,

    I CAN GRILL YOU UP SOME
            SALMON?
    I DO HAVE SOME FROZEN.

PRETTY SURE
FISH IS AN ANIMAL.

        NO, SOME VEGETARIANS
        DO EAT FISH, DON'T THEY?

PESCATARIANS EAT FISH.

   OKAY. YOU'RE THE TEACHER.

              RICE AND SALAD
              WILL BE JUST FINE.

         THANK YOU.

                        OKAY.

                WHEN IT COMES
               TO VEGETABLES,

         NOTHING BEATS
    DINA'S CANDIED CARROTS.

       THEY'RE AMAZING.

        YEAH, I TRY TO
       AVOID SUGAR, TOO.

    BUT I WILL TAKE A ROLL.

        GO CRAZY, PAL.

    JONATHAN, TELL EVERYONE
     ABOUT YOUR NEW PLAY.

           OH, YES.

         SO EXCITING.

       WELL, IT'S CALLED
        "SUFFER TIME."

I'M SORRY?

        -"SUFFER TIME."
        -"SUFFER TIME."

OKAY, UH...

WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

         WELL, UH, DASHED HOPES,
         LOST DREAMS,

       UNREQUITED LOVE.

               SO IT'S A COMEDY?

          [LAUGHTER]

     YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY
    RATHER NOT DISCUSS IT,

     IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

           OH, YEAH.

       WELL, EVERYTHING
      LOOKS LOVELY, MOM.

                 IT'S SUPER,
                 AS USUAL, DINA.

            HEY, JONATHAN, AFTER
            WE'RE DONE EATING,

     DO YOU WANT TO WATCH
        SOME FOOTBALL?

   I THINK MICHIGAN'S GONNA
       CRUSH PENN STATE!

      AMERICAN FOOTBALL'S
   A LITTLE RAH-RAH FOR ME,

BUT, HEY, ENJOY.

 I HOPE JONATHAN
ENJOYED HIMSELF.

     HE SEEMS A LITTLE...

           SERIOUS.

NO, HE'S JUST DEEPER
THAN MOST GUYS.

AND HE HAD A GREAT TIME,
I PROMISE.

        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      YOU HARDLY TOUCHED
       YOUR ROAST BEEF.

          I TOLD YOU,
   EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS.

    I'M JUST TRYING TO BE--

   TRYING TO BE CONSIDERATE
    OF YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND.

DID YOU KNOW

VEGETARIANS CAN LIVE
EIGHT YEARS LONGER

THAN MEAT-EATERS?

    DOESN'T MATTER IF A GUY
             LIVES
        TO BE A HUNDRED

     IF HE ISN'T FOR YOU.

WELL, WHAT IF
HE IS FOR ME?

            LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING
            IS JUST...

                WATCH OUT FOR
                THOSE KIND OF...

       COMPLICATED ONES,
         OKAY, HONEY?

             OKAY.

            ADAM...

                LOOK WHAT I HAVE
                FOR YOU.

THERE'S A GOOD BOY.

       LOOK WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU!
       WANT ME TO PACK THIS UP?

         YES, PLEASE.

          THANK YOU.

OUR FATE CHOOSES US.

               IT'S NOT AS EASY
               AS ALL THAT, TOM.

IT'S AS EASY OR AS HARD
AS YOU MAKE IT,

WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

         I WOULD SAY WE'RE
         JUST LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

OR ARE WE?

            LUCKY?

NO... ALIVE.

      [HESITANT APPLAUSE]

                 JONATHAN, HEY.

YOU HATED IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

                   NO, I DIDN'T.

             IT WAS... STUNNING.

     OH, SAVE IT, BAILEY.

           IT STANK.

    YOU KNOW IT, I KNOW IT,

    THEY CERTAINLY KNOW IT.

         YOU'RE BEING
   WAY TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

   YOU SHOULD BE PROUD, YOU
             KNOW?

         YOU REALLY--YOU REALLY
         ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING.

        SERIOUSLY?

               SERIOUSLY.

      YOU KNOW, YOU MADE
         SOMETHING...

        SO... SPECIAL.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

    IT PROBABLY JUST NEEDS
     A LITTLE BIT OF WORK.

             YEAH.

MAYBE...

      FILL IN A FEW GAPS,
    CLEAN UP SOME DIALOGUE,

  MAYBE EVEN TRIM A SCENE OR
             TWO.

 TRIM. TRIM, TRIM AWAY, YEAH.

    YOU KNOW, LESS IS MORE.

     THAT'S WHAT I TELL MY
           STUDENTS.

        THANKS, BAILEY!

     LESS REALLY IS MORE.

             HEY.

                             OH.

         CHEERS.

      [CLINKING GLASSES]

                   TO TRIMMING.

          AND GENIUS.

                       [SIGHING]

SO IT WAS
REALLY THAT BAD?

         I'M AN ENGLISH TEACHER

       AND MY BOYFRIEND
       IS A TERRIBLE PLAYWRIGHT.

             IT'S DEEPLY AWKWARD
             AND IRONIC.

AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T TWIST
YOUR ANKLE THIS TIME.

             NO, JUST THE TRUTH.

[AMBER CHUCKLES] OH.

               DINNER IS READY.

           ALREADY?

           ALREADY?
           IT TOOK ME TWO HOURS.

WOW, I HAD NO IDEA.

     OH, WELL, COME TASTE

        THIS DELICIOUS,
  DAIRY-FREE SOUP I MADE YOU.

   ACTUALLY, I'M ON A MAJOR
             ROLL
      WITH THIS REWRITE,

       BUT YOU... ENJOY.

   NO, NO, NO, I'LL WAIT FOR
             YOU.

      I'LL KEEP IT WARM.

       I APPRECIATE IT.

REALLY.

       BUT I'M TRYING TO
    MAKE THIS PLAY AMAZING,

 AND, WELL, YOU WOULDN'T WANT
              ME

    TO INTERRUPT THE FLOW,
          WOULD YOU?

           NO... NO.

               GO WITH THE FLOW.

             [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

          HEY, GUYS.

    [WHISPERS] DOWN, GIRL.

    LET'S SEE WHAT THIS IS
            ABOUT.

          [CHUCKLING]

            OKAY...

          BAILEY, HI.

             -HI.
           -WELCOME.

           HEY, YOU.

      I'M NOT ONE TO MISS
    A "SUNNY SUNDAY SALE."

          WHICH IS...
    WHICH IS WHAT, EXACTLY?

   IT'S SUNNY, IT'S SUNDAY,
     AND STUFF'S ON SALE.

WHY NOT, RIGHT?

         THERE YOU GO.

     HOW'S MR. ADAM DOING?

HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

        OH, HE'S GREAT,
        AS YOU CAN SEE.

      HE'S ALWAYS GREAT.

        AND ADAM'S DAD?

     UM, MOVED TO SEATTLE,

              BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
              WITH...

   THE GIRL FROM THE PARTY.

          NO. REALLY?

                           YES.

    TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN
           FICTION.

                BUT I GOT ADAM
                OUT OF THE DEAL,

  SO, YOU KNOW, HAPPY ENDING.

HAS ADAM BEEN ASKING FOR
A BROTHER OR SISTER YET?

  UM, HE ACTUALLY HAS KIND OF
   A HALF-SISTER RIGHT NOW.

         A DALMATIAN NAMED EVE.

         ADAM AND EVE?

        [LAUGHS] YEAH.

    WHEN HER DAD, JONATHAN,

             TOLD ME ABOUT THAT,

                   I DIDN'T EVEN
                   BELIEVE HIM.

    ARE ADAM AND EVE CLOSE?

     YEAH, THEY SEE QUITE
     A BIT OF EACH OTHER,

           SO YEAH,
    THEY'RE GETTING THERE.

                 HI, SWEETHEART.

                   UM, SO, HEY,

    IS DOG FOOD PART OF THE
             SALE?

NO, BUT, UH,
FOR YOU AND ADAM,

I CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

HOW ABOUT 10% OFF?

OKAY, 15, BUT THAT'S
MY FINAL OFFER.

                 [LAUGHS] OKAY.

  WELL, WHAT CAN YOU SHOW ME

     IN THE WAY OF A NICE
     LAMB AND RICE KIBBLE?

      [KNOCKING ON DOOR]

     [INSISTENT KNOCKING]

             HEY!

                  LISTEN, I HAVE
                  GREAT NEWS!

YOU DO? WHAT?

 I JUST FINISHED THE REWRITE.

 THE PLAY IS OFFICIALLY DONE.

       CONGRATULATIONS,
   I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT!

I CAN READ IT, RIGHT?

   NOT ONLY CAN YOU READ IT,
  YOU CAN READ IT RIGHT NOW.

     BUT WE'LL HAVE TO BE
  AT AMBER'S IN 10 MINUTES--

BAILEY, I NEED
 YOUR OPINION.

IT CAN'T WAIT.

   I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT I'VE
             GOT.

  WE'LL MISS THE WHOLE PARTY.

   WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO
      TO SOME SILLY PARTY

   WHEN YOU COULD BE MAKING

       SUCH AN IMPORTANT
    CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION?

    ALL RIGHT, I'M CONFUSED
       ABOUT SOMETHING.

       WHEN I WANTED TO
       READ YOUR STUFF,

   YOU PROTECTED IT FROM ME

              LIKE IT WAS SOME
              FRAGILE BUTTERFLY.

             WHEN YOU WANT ME
             TO READ YOUR STUFF,

        I HAVE TO MISS MY BEST
        FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

     YOU WANTED AN ARTIST,
        I'M AN ARTIST.

THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

       I WANTED SOMEONE
    BRIGHT AND INTERESTING,

        NOT SOME MOODY,
         SELF-ABSORBED
     PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL.

           "PSEUDO?"

        [QUIETLY] YEAH.

         I KNEW THINGS
   WOULDN'T WORK OUT BETWEEN
              US.

LOOK HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU
TO RE-READ PROUST.

I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF
AN ENGLISH TEACHER ARE YOU?

     ONE WHO LOVES TO READ

      AND HAS NEVER BEEN
  SO BORED BY A SET OF BOOKS

         IN HER LIFE.

       ARE YOU GOING TO
     READ MY PLAY OR NOT?

      HAVE YOU NOT HEARD
   ANYTHING I'VE JUST SAID?

 ACTUALLY, I THINK I'VE HEARD
    MORE THAN I NEEDED TO.

               GOODBYE, BAILEY.

GOODBYE.

DON'T LET THE DOOR
HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT.

         [SLAMS DOOR]

        [SIGHS HEAVILY]

HE JUST LEFT YOU?
         [SLAMS DOOR]

     RIGHT THEN AND THERE?

                  WELL, IT WAS
                  PRETTY MUTUAL.

               BUT IT WAS OKAY.

 I HAD AMBER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
           TO GO TO,

    SO I HAD A GREAT TIME.

          ATTA GIRL,
   YOU HAD SOMEWHERE TO GO,

 AND YOU WERE ALL DRESSED UP.

THE GUY WAS A WET BLANKET.

WHO NEEDS HIM?

       I DIDN'T EXACTLY
     PUT ON BLINDERS WITH
           JONATHAN.

    BUT I DEFINITELY PUT ON
  SOME ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.

   HONEY, SOMETIMES, WE JUST
              SEE
     WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.

          [LAUGHING]

      IS THAT HOW YOU GOT
          SPOT HERE?

   WELL, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
      EVE WAS VERY MOODY?

    TURNS OUT SHE WAS MORE
           ATTACHED
      TO ME THAN I KNEW.

      SINCE WE BROKE UP,
   SHE'S BEEN INCONSOLABLE.

   I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

     SO I BROUGHT HER HERE
          TO SEE YOU.

            EVE...

          COME HERE.

      SO YOU'LL TAKE HER?

    UH... TO FOSTER, OR...?

     JUST UNTIL SHE'S BACK
       TO HER OLD SELF.

         I DON'T KNOW.
    I MEAN, SHE'S YOUR DOG.

  NOBODY REALLY OWNS ANYBODY
         OR ANYTHING.

           BESIDES,

     LOOK HOW MUCH BETTER
       SHE ALREADY SEEMS

WITH YOU.

   SO, THAT'S HOW EVE BECAME
             MINE.

      AND ONCE I HAD HER,
    I WOULDN'T LET HER GO.

STILL DOESN'T
EXPLAIN THE DRESS.

     YEAH, OR LITTLE MISS
        SHIRLEY THERE.

  WELL, NOW'S WHEN IT REALLY
       GETS INTERESTING.

                 OH, HEY, I, UH,

            I HEAR THERE'S A HOT
            NEW SCIENCE SUB.

             ROAMING THE HALLS.

         WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT?

NO, NO.
NO MORE SERIAL DATING.

THE NEXT BOYFRIEND
WILL BE PERFECT,

OR THERE WILL BE
NO BOYFRIEND.

        DEFINE "PERFECT"
        AFTER WADE AND JONATHAN.

MM... BALANCED, TOGETHER,

KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS,

KNOWS WHO HE WANTS--

     OF COURSE, AND WITH
     THE FACE AND BODY OF A GOD.


LET'S GET FIT.

             OH, HEY, WANT TO GO
             POWER-HIKING

             WITH ADAM AND EVE?

MM... LET'S DO YOGA.

                   YOGA, HMM...

            AND CONTINUE
            IN OUR DOWNWARD DOG,

         HIPS UP TO THE CEILING,

           SHOULDERS
     AWAY FROM YOUR EARS,

     FEET HIP-WIDTH APART.

     I'VE NEVER SEEN A DOG
       IN THIS POSITION,

DOWNWARD OR OTHERWISE.

       THIS IS FUN, SHH.

             -NO.
             -NO?

         IT'S NOT FUN.

AND COMING INTO
PLANK POSE...

LOWER TO CHATURANGA...

AND INTO UPWARD-FACING DOG.

          BEGINNERS?

      WHAT GAVE US AWAY?

    ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10,
       HOW ARE WE DOING?

       OH, UH, SOLID 7.

             NICE.

DON'T WORRY,

YOU'LL BE "UPWARD DOGGING"
 WITH THE BEST IN NO TIME.

   NOW, WE'RE GOING TO STAY
             HERE

AND TAKE A FULL
THREE BREATHS.

      [BREATHING DEEPLY]

                         NO.

       [EXHALING DEEPLY]

             GOOD WORK, LADIES.

           YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY
           YOGA SURVIVORS.

                I'M ERIC STRANG,
                BY THE WAY.

I'M BAILEY.

AMBER.

SO, ERIC, UH,

WILL WE SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
AT THIS CLASS?

             UH, IF I'M NOT
             DRIVING GOLF BALLS.

            I USUALLY SWITCH OFF
            WITH YOGA, SO...

OH, I LOVE GOLF.

                    YOU DO?

YEAH.

        YOU SHOULD SEE HER SLAM
       AROUND THAT LITTLE BALL.

SHE SHOWS IT
NO MERCY.

      SHE'S EXAGGERATING
         A LITTLE BIT.

                           YEAH?

          OKAY, WELL,
          WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME?

           WHY DON'T YOU MEET ME
           AT THE DRIVING RANGE

         NEXT SATURDAY MORNING,

     OVER ON BRIAR THERE.

        WE'LL KNOCK OUT
        A FEW BUCKETS.

         MAYBE I WILL.

             OKAY.

    WELL, NICE MEETING YOU.

                     YOU DO KNOW

      HE'S TALKING ABOUT
     BIG BOY GOLF, RIGHT?

       NOT THE WINDMILL,
      LOOP-DE-LOOP KIND?

      HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

            RIGHT.

           OH...KAY.

         UH, I TOLD YOU
         THAT AMBER EXAGGERATED.

NO WORRIES.

HEY, I'M JUST
GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

           [LAUGHS]

                    SO, I AM NOT
                    AN EXPERT,

    BUT, UH, CAN I GIVE YOU
   SOME ADVICE, ABOUT GOLF?

      "KEEP MY DAY JOB?"

"DON'T GO PRO."

  BOTH OF THOSE ARE ACCURATE.

   NO, I DOWNLOADED THIS APP
         JUST IN CASE,

    JUST TO HELP YOU HERE.

     UM, SO SEE THIS GUY?

   SEE WHAT HE'S DOING THERE
   WITH THE FOLLOW THROUGH?

        IT'S ALL ABOUT
      THE FOLLOW THROUGH.

                   RIGHT?

        OKAY.

         OKAY, SO WATCH ME HERE.

       YOU WANT TO, UH,

   TRY TO THINK OF THE CLUB

        AS LIKE A WHIP.

          YOU WANT TO
     WHIP THROUGH THE BALL

   AND THEN FOLLOW THROUGH.

          THE KEY IS
  THE FOLLOW THROUGH, RIGHT?

             NICE.

       IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

  WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A GO?

        [LAUGHS] OKAY.

          WHIP THROUGH THE BALL,
          FOLLOW THROUGH.

             OKAY.

      FOLLOWING THROUGH.

          IS THAT...?

OH.

            WHOOPS.

               THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
               WE GOT THIS.

                   OKAY, GRAB
                   ANOTHER BALL,

                     AND, UM...

THAT'S GOOD.

OKAY, SO TAKE
THE POSITION AGAIN.

            OKAY...

NOW, JUST RELAX,

AND REMEMBER
THE FOLLOW THROUGH,

AND NICE AND EASY SWING.

GIVE IT A SHOT.

             OKAY.

     FOLLOWING... THROUGH.

THERE WE GO!

           [SQUEALS IN TRIUMPH]

         I TOLD YOU
         AMBER WAS EXAGGERATING.

NO, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

I'M JUST GLAD
WE DID THIS.

IT WAS FUN.

                     IT WAS FUN.

          IT WAS MORE FUN
          THAN YOGA, I MUST SAY,

               AND LESS PAINFUL.

WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

I'VE HAD A FEW FOUR-PUTTS
THAT WERE PRETTY PAINFUL.

                           YEAH?

          SO, I DIDN'T EVEN ASK,
          WHAT DO YOU DO?

OH, I'M IN RETAIL.

WHAT ABOUT YOU?

             I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL.

         [MUMBLING] UH, I TEACH
         HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH...

         I CAN HARDLY SPEAK IT.


WELL, ENGLISH,
THAT'S GOOD

BECAUSE I SPEAK ENGLISH.

                   THERE YOU GO.

YOU WANT SOME HELP?

LET ME HELP YOU.

               SURE, THANK YOU.

UM... LET ME...

THERE YOU GO.

YEAH, A GOOD BOOK,
A GLASS OF WINE,

ROARING FIRE,
I'M A PRETTY HAPPY GUY.

             NICE.

             HAVE YOU EVER READ

   "IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME"
          BY PROUST?

            BY WHO?

       THAT IS ACTUALLY
      THE CORRECT ANSWER.

         PLEASE FORGET
     THAT I MENTIONED IT.

        OKAY, I'M GLAD
      I PASSED THAT ONE,

      WHATEVER THAT WAS.

          I'M SORRY.

             OKAY.

          WELL, UH...
   WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN--

 NOT GOLF, BUT A PROPER DATE.

      I WOULD LIKE THAT.

            -YEAH?
            -YEAH.

          OKAY THEN.

UM...

PHONE NUMBER?

        SO, OF COURSE,

     I AM MISS GOLF KLUTZ
         OF THE YEAR,

     BUT ERIC IS SO KIND,

            AND HE'S SO PATIENT,
            AND SO SWEET,

         THAT, BY THE END OF IT,

               I KIND OF KNEW
               WHAT I WAS DOING.

WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

               YOU HOPE SO HOW?

HONEY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE SEEING WADE?

DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID TO YOU?

               YOU SAID TO
               STOP SEEING WADE.

NO. [CHUCKLES] NO.

THE POINT IS, ANY GUY
WOULD BE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU,

WHETHER YOU RUN MARATHONS,
EAT MEAT, OR PLAY GOLF.

      OH, ERIC DOWNLOADED
        THIS APP FOR ME

         THAT SHOWS ME
     A PERFECT GOLF SWING

               START TO FINISH.

               IT'S SO HELPFUL.

HMM, AND THOUGHTFUL,

       AND PRESUMPTUOUS.

             OH, MY GOSH, MOM--

      WHAT?

  I SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST.

            LISTEN,

        I GOOGLED HIM.

YEAH?

       HE'S ERIC STRANG
  OF STRANG'S FASHION SALONS.

WHAT?

                V.P. OF BUSINESS
                DEVELOPMENT.

OKAY. OKAY,
SO HE'S THE HEIR

OF A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL
NATIONAL CHAIN

OF HIGH-END
CLOTHING STORES,

BUT HE IS STILL
JUST A GUY.

       A CLEARLY SOLID,
  RESPONSIBLE, AMBITIOUS GUY.

MM-HMM.

BAILEY,

DO YOU LIKE ERIC?

              I THINK
              HE'S PRETTY GREAT.

OKAY, SO THEN,
AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

THERE'S REALLY
ONE OTHER THING

THAT SHOULD
MATTER TO YOU.

             WHAT?

 WHERE DOES HE STAND ON DOGS?

     SO, ADAM HERE IS THE
           SWEETEST,
      HAPPIEST BOY EVER,

        AND EVE IS, UH,
      SHE'S MORE SERIOUS,

    SHE'S KIND OF ANXIOUS.

            YEAH...

       DO YOU LIKE DOGS?

                     UH, TRUTH?

          I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN
          A BIG DOG PERSON.

OKAY, YOU'VE NOT MET
THE RIGHT ONE, CLEARLY.

HERE, TRY THIS GUY ON
FOR SIZE.

                  OKAY...


                  HERE WE GO--
                  OH. ALL RIGHT.

HEY, WHO'S WALKING
WHO THERE?

                   WHAT DO I DO?

        JUST-JUST STOP.

OKAY.

       [CHUCKLING] OKAY.

                           PHEW!

      HERE. OKAY, THANKS.

                     THANK YOU.

        YES, SIR. OKAY.

         HE'S ACTUALLY
    CALMED DOWN QUITE A BIT

      SINCE I'VE HAD HIM.

         CALMED DOWN?

     REALLY, THAT'S, UH...

       YOU MUST HAVE HAD
  YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU.

           OH, YEAH.

     UH, SPEAKING OF WORK,
 YOU SAID YOU WERE IN RETAIL.

TURNS OUT,
YOU ARE RETAIL.

          I GOOGLED.
       COULDN'T RESIST.

                     YEAH, WELL,

     WHEN YOU'RE A STRANG,

      THERE'S NO ESCAPING
     THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

     NOT THAT I'D WANT TO,
            THOUGH.

         I MEAN, IT'S
  THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD.

      IT'S CREATIVE, IT'S
         CHALLENGING,
       IT'S PURPOSEFUL.

          IT'S GREAT.

      YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY.

                WELL, I MET YOU,
                DIDN'T I?

     YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?

                           YEAH.


HERE, BOY.

      [LAUGHING] OKAY...

                   OH. OH, WOW.

       ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

OKAY, DOWN, BOY.

                   HE'S A LOVER.

WHAT'S THE--
WHAT DO I SAY?

                   I DON'T KNOW.

                 I DON'T KNOW
                 HOW TO STOP IT.

                 I NEVER TRIED.

UH, HE IS A GOOD KISSER,
I'LL SAY THAT.

       [LAUGHING] OKAY, OKAY...

         HERE, I THINK I HAVE...

I GUESS I'M NOT SO MUCH
GOOD WITH DROOL EITHER.

                     OH, WELL...

                 HOW AM I DOING?

   I THINK YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

               I'VE GOT... YEAH.

          THANK YOU.

          [CHUCKLES]

             [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

                             HI!

           HI, YOU!

       OH, MY GOODNESS,
     LET ME SEE YOUR FACE.

      [GASPS IN DELIGHT]

             OH...

          YOU THINK ANY OF THESE
          DOGS HAVE PAPERS?

PROBABLY NOT.

IT'S NOT ABOUT PEDIGREE,
IT'S A RESCUE, YOU KNOW?

        HEY, YOU GUYS.

        THIS FELLA HERE
    COULD USE A GOOD HOME.

HEY, COLE.
HOW'S IT GOING?

                 WAIT, IS THIS
                 THE FAMOUS EVE?

THIS IS THE ONE.

                         HI! HI.

         WHICH, WAIT,
   SHOULD MAKE YOU JONATHAN,
             YES?

           OH. NOPE.

             UM...

SO, EVE WAS JONATHAN'S,

      AND NOW SHE'S MINE,

       AND THIS IS ERIC.

UM, BABE, THIS ONE
IS SO CUTE.

DID YOU SEE THE LITTLE FACE
ON THIS ONE?

    WHAT KIND OF DOG IS HE?

  OH, HE'S A LITTLE OF THIS,
       A LITTLE OF THAT.

        DO YOU HAVE ONE

        THAT'S A LOT OF
    ALL OF ONE THING, OR..?

     AROUND HERE, ALL DOGS
      ARE CREATED EQUAL.

    BABE, LOOK AT HIS FACE.

     HE'S A SWEET POTATO.

LOOK AT HIS FACE!

                           YUP.

[SQUEALING IN DELIGHT]

            I KNOW,
  BUT I GOTTA THINK ABOUT IT.

             OKAY.

              LOOK, IF I COME
              ACROSS A PUREBRED,

    I CAN GIVE YOU A SHOUT.

             OKAY.

IT'S LIKE BUYING A CAR,
I WANT TO LOOK AROUND.

                IT'S SO NOT LIKE
                BUYING A CAR.

        IT'S LIKE CHOOSING
        A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY.

               IT'S ABOUT LOVE.


                         IT IS.

                 COME ON, FELLA.

YOU'RE REALLY SPECIAL,
YOU KNOW THAT?

             THANKS. SO ARE YOU.

THANK YOU.

SO, NOW THAT MY PARENTS ARE
BACK FROM THEIR WORLD
CRUISE,

I REALLY WANT YOU
TO MEET THEM.

                I WOULD LOVE TO.
                WHEN?

IT'S ALL SET.

A SUNDAY BRUNCH,

AT MY MOM AND DAD'S
COUNTRY CLUB.

                 A COUNTRY CLUB,
                 THAT'S SWANKY.

IT'S JUST A PLACE
THEY'VE BELONGED TO FOREVER.

MY GRANDPARENTS, TOO.

IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A STRANG TRADITION THING.

                 YEAH? DOES THAT
                 INCLUDE YOU?

UH, MARRIED
COUPLES ONLY.

                       AH-HAH.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

AN OLD BYLAW.

                       THIS WAY.

BUT I AM HOPING
TO BECOME A MEMBER

AT SOME POINT.

                       MM-HMM.

           HEY, YOU!

      BAILEY, WHAT'S YOUR
           PLEASURE,
    PROSECCO OR CHAMPAGNE?

           OH, UM...

          CHAMPAGNE.

  IF IT'S OKAY WITH EVERYONE
             ELSE.

  A BOTTLE OF CRISTAL, 2004.

MIGHT I SUGGEST THE 2006?

                 IT WAS A BETTER
                 GROWING SEASON.

I'M IN YOUR CAPABLE
HANDS, ERNESTO.

                   WELL, BAILEY,

           TELL US,
   WHAT IS IT YOU DO AGAIN?

  OH, I'M AN ENGLISH TEACHER.

       AT PARKVIEW HIGH.

PARKVIEW HIGH?

  ISN'T THAT A PUBLIC SCHOOL?

       YES. YES, IT IS.

OH.

             WELL.

       ISN'T THAT NICE?

          TEACHING IS
      A NOBLE PROFESSION.

    WE NEED MORE TEACHERS.

  AND WHAT DO YOUR PEOPLE DO?

GRANDMA,

   THAT'S A LITTLE PERSONAL.

NO, THAT'S FINE.

      UM, MY FATHER DIED
      ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO,

                     HE MANAGED

A VALU-MART DOWNTOWN,

         AND MY MOTHER
     WORKS FOR A DENTIST.

        OH, HYGIENIST?

         RECEPTIONIST.

                         WELL...

               WHERE WOULD WE BE

   WITHOUT THE GATEKEEPERS?

          AM I RIGHT?

          ABSOLUTELY.

     SHE RUNS THAT OFFICE
  LIKE A WELL-OILED MACHINE.

        LOOK, I KNOW
        THEY'RE A LITTLE FORMAL,

                BUT THEY'VE BEEN
                GREAT PARENTS.

             AND MY GRANDMOTHER,

              SHE'S ALWAYS
              BEEN THERE FOR ME.

WELL, THEY SEEMED
VERY NICE.

I JUST HOPE
THEY LIKED ME.

             ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
             THEY LOVED YOU.

REALLY?

WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

             BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

               I WANT YOU
               TO SEE SOMETHING.

                   TAKE A LOOK.

        WHO LIVES HERE?

DO YOU LIKE IT?

                 IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

     YEAH, I'VE HAD MY EYE
      ON IT FOR A WHILE.

            TO BUY?

                     [CHUCKLES]

            IT'S KIND OF
            A BIG HOUSE, THOUGH,

            FOR JUST ONE PERSON,
            DON'T YOU THINK?

   IT'S KIND OF A BIG HOUSE

         FOR MY ENTIRE
  TENTH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS.

                       [LAUGHS]

   [BAILEY]: I MEAN, IT HAS,
 LIKE, ITS OWN LITTLE FOREST.

   AND THE STONEWORK OUT IN
            FRONT,
         IT'S AMAZING,

      AND THEN THE HOUSE
          IS SO HUGE.

     IT'S LIKE A LOG CABIN
    CROSSED WITH A CASTLE.

OOH.

YEAH, WELL,
FIRST THINGS FIRST, HONEY.

I MEAN, ERIC HASN'T EVEN
 ASKED YOU TO MARRY HIM.

       THE WAY HE'S BEEN
        ACTING LATELY,

      HE MAY AS WELL HAVE
      AN ENGAGEMENT RING

    TAPED TO HIS FOREHEAD.

    HMM, AND IS THAT A GOOD
            THING?

                HE'S ALL
                I'VE EVER WANTED

                     IN SOMEONE.

        [PHONE CHIMES]

OKAY, BUT
DO YOU LOVE HIM?

             OH, MY GOSH,
             THIS IS SO PERFECT!

            TWO PUREBREDS JUST
            CAME IN FOR ADOPTION

             AT COLE'S PET SHOP,

   AND IT'S ERIC'S BIRTHDAY
          COMING UP.

YOU WON'T FIND
 A BETTER DOG.

         WE NEVER GET
  FULL-BRED LABS FOR RESCUE.

      LAB, THAT'S LIKE
      A GOLDEN RETRIEVER, RIGHT?

                     LIKE ADAM?

             YEAH.

            YEAH, UH...
            ADAM IS A BIT, UM...

       TOO ACTIVE FOR ME MAYBE.

       AND, UH, HE'S A BIT WET.

                   THERE YOU GO.

WELL, THIS IS SAM,

HE'S A WIRE-HAIRED
JACK RUSSELL.

HE'S A SUPER LITTLE DUDE.

TERRIERS ARE PRETTY

           HIGH STRUNG, THOUGH,

           FROM WHAT I'VE READ.

      THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH

        AS HIGH STRUNG
    AS WHOEVER RAISES THEM.

         OKAY, BUDDY.

  BUT THEY SHED, TOO, RIGHT?

WELL, MOST DOGS DO.

           KNOW WHY?
         THEY'RE DOGS.

WELL, UH...

   LET ME SLEEP ON IT, OKAY?

     DON'T SLEEP TOO LONG.

   DOGS LIKE THESE, THEY GO
             FAST.

        I SO WANTED YOU
         TO HAVE A DOG

      FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

                         I KNOW.

    [QUIET CLASSICAL MUSIC
            PLAYS]

         I DON'T KNOW
  WHAT COULD BE KEEPING ERIC.

      HE DID SAY HE HAD A
           SURPRISE.

      THE ONLY SURPRISE
      IS THAT HE'S NOT HERE YET,

      AND I AM STARVING.

           [BARKING]

SURPRISE!

      [GASPS IN DELIGHT]
         OH, MY GOSH!

                     WHO'S THIS?

         -WHO IS THIS?
         -IT'S MY DOG.

MOTHER PICKED HER OUT.

          OH, I THOUGHT
          WE'D DO THAT TOGETHER?

         OH, COME ON,
     WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

               I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
               PICK HER OUT.

          I HAVE AN ACQUAINTANCE
          AT THE CLUB

        WHO SHOWS DOGS,
  AND WINS TROPHIES AND SUCH,

 AND I ASKED HER TO RECOMMEND
          A SMALL DOG

WITH GOOD BREEDING.

       IT'S A SHIH TZU.

       THEY DON'T SHED.
   THEY'RE HYPO-ALLERGENIC.

AND THE BREEDER
PROMISES

    THAT HERS RARELY BARK.

              NEVER, IF PROPERLY
              TRAINED.

       WHAT'S HER NAME?

                 UH, BALTHAZAR'S
                 IMPERIAL BELLE,

                   ACCORDING TO
                    HER PAPERS.

      OH, FANCY SCHMANCY.
          [CHUCKLES]

OH, BELLE?

OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

NO, I THINK YOU'RE
MORE OF A SHIRLEY.

           SHIRLEY?

    MM-HMM.

    THAT'S MY LATE SISTER'S
             NAME!

                    OH, HOW NICE
                    IS THAT?

   THEN YOU CAN THINK OF HER
  EVERY TIME YOU SEE THE DOG.

          [CHUCKLING]

     I REALLY DON'T THINK
    I WOULD WANT AN ANIMAL

    NAMED AFTER MY SISTER.

                   OH, NOW,
                   MOTHER, HUSH.

       IT'S ERIC'S DOG,

        HE CAN NAME IT
      WHATEVER HE WANTS.

                 SHIRLEY IT IS.

SHIRLEY IT IS.

          TO SHIRLEY.

         TO SHIRLEY.

                     TO SHIRLEY.

             AW...

            OH, WATCH
            THE FURNITURE, DEAR.

OH.

             OKAY.

             YEAH, LET'S JUST...

         DINNER WAS DELICIOUS,
         MRS. STRANG, THANK YOU.

                         YES.

   OH, WELL, I WISH I COULD
  TAKE ALL THE CREDIT FOR IT,

    BUT THE CREDIT GOES TO
            SYBIL.

       I DON'T KNOW WHAT
    I WOULD DO WITHOUT HER.

YOU COULD START BY LEARNING
TO LIGHT THE STOVE.

                   THAT'S ENOUGH
                   WINE, MOTHER.

                   SYBIL, DEAR,

           WILL YOU, UH, HELP ME
           IN THE KITCHEN?

            PLEASE?

       I AM SO GLAD THAT
     BOTH OF YOU ARE HERE

       TO HELP CELEBRATE
         MY BIRTHDAY.

        I SECOND THAT.

COUNT ME IN.

                AND I WOULD LIKE
                TO THANK YOU

               FOR WELCOMING US
                INTO YOUR HOME.

YOU CAN THANK ME.

I PAID FOR IT.

     [CHUCKLING AWKWARDLY]

                 HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
                 SWEETHEART!

     [GUSHING IN DELIGHT]

LOOK AT THAT!

          [LAUGHING]

OH, THANKS, MOM.

             THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

             THANK YOU SO MUCH.

             PHEW.

                     [LAUGHING]

UM, BAILEY,

             OKAY.

                         OKAY...

              OH, MY, THIS COULD
              FEED AN ARMY.


           YOU BETTER BE HUNGRY.

                   WHAT IS THIS?

THIS IS...

   TONIGHT'S REAL SURPRISE.

      OPEN IT.

         BAILEY DALEY,

      WILL YOU MARRY ME?

    [LAUGHS IN SHOCK] YES!

                 [LAUGHING] YES.

                        YES.

    [CLAPPING IN JOYFULLY]

          [LAUGHING]

THESE ARE JUST
SOME OF THE DRESSES

THAT WE SELL AT STRANG'S.

MY PERSONAL FAVORITE...

           OH, WOW.

IS THE ONE WITH
PEARL BEADS

AND A HIGH-NECK BODICE.

TRES ELEGANT.

          [CHUCKLES]

              YOU'D LOOK AMAZING
              IN THAT, BAILEY.

             YOU HAVE TO GET IT.

      OH, IT'S GORGEOUS,

       I JUST--I'M SURE
   I COULD NOT AFFORD THIS.

OH, NO, LISTEN, DEAR,

LIKE I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE,

ERIC'S FATHER AND I,

WE'RE HANDLING EVERYTHING,

SO NOT TO WORRY.

           AND THAT'S AN ORDER.

          [CHUCKLING]

           OH, AND THAT YOU WEAR

            GRANDMOTHER STRANG'S
            RUBY EARRINGS

       AS YOUR "SOMETHING OLD."

YES.

     OH, I WAS GOING TO WEAR
     THESE LITTLE PEARL EARRINGS

           THAT MY DAD GAVE ME
           FOR MY 10th BIRTHDAY.

                       PEARL?

                 BUT, HONEY,
                 THESE ARE RUBY.

         THEY'RE ONE OF A KIND.

               YOU COULDN'T EVEN
               BUY THEM TODAY.

MM-HMM. NO,
THEY'LL BE PERFECT.

YOU'LL LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

    SO, OUR TABLE SHOULD BE
    IMMEDIATE FAMILY ONLY,

          OF COURSE.

WAIT, WHAT ABOUT
AMBER AND TRAVIS?

            UH, AMBER AND TRAVIS
            CAN SIT... HERE...

              WITH MY ASSISTANT,
              AND HER MOTHER,

                 AND MY COUSINS
                  FROM NEWPORT.

WAIT, BUT THEY DON'T
KNOW THOSE PEOPLE.

     WELL, NOW THEY WILL.

  ALL RIGHT, WHY ARE WE EVEN
     DOING THIS RIGHT NOW?

          WE HAVEN'T
     SENT OUT INVITATIONS?

  WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING.

            OH, I'M JUST
            GETTING A HEAD START

                 ON MY TIMELINE.

YOU HAVE A TIMELINE?

                       OH, YEAH.

              I HAVE SCHEDULED
              EVERY SINGLE THING

                WE NEED TO DO
                FOR THE WEDDING,

         IN ORDER, FROM A TO Z.

              TAKES OUT
              ALL THE GUESSWORK.

                   LOOK AT THIS.

OH, WOW.

IT TAKES OUT
ALL THE SURPRISE, TOO, HUH?

                       EXACTLY.

HI, EVE.

                 NO, NO, NO, NO!

                           OH...

      BAILEY, COME ON...

     WHY-WHY AREN'T YOU--

EVE-- OKAY.

    WHY AREN'T YOU TRAINING
             THEM?

     BECAUSE THEY'RE DOGS.

   BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE PARK
    AND THEY'RE BEING DOGS.

   WELL THEN, THEY SHOULD BE
   ON A LEASH AT ALL TIMES.

     NO, THEY SHOULD NOT.

     AND LOOK AT SHIRLEY,
    SHE DOESN'T RUN AROUND.

       WHAT ABOUT THAT?
           I MEAN...

NO, I KNOW, THIS IS...

THIS IS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

THIS IS WHO SHE IS.

YOU KNOW, ALL DOGS
ARE DIFFERENT.

  WELL, AT LEAST SHE DOESN'T
  SLOBBER ALL OVER EVERYONE.

             I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
             HOW MANY GERMS

           ARE IN A DOG'S MOUTH?

          HOW MANY THINGS
          YOU CAN GET FROM THEM?

           ALL KINDS OF STUFF--

NOPE, ZERO.

LOOK IT UP.

                         OKAY...

         YOU KNOW WHAT, BAILEY,

        SOMETIMES, I THINK
        YOU CARE MORE ABOUT DOGS

       THAN YOU DO ABOUT PEOPLE.

YOU REALLY
DON'T LIKE DOGS, DO YOU?

     THEY'RE NOT MY THING.

  THEY'RE YOUR THING, BAILEY.

                I TOLD YOU THAT,
                REMEMBER?

        AND SHIRLEY...

   YEAH, I GOT HER JUST FOR
             YOU.

    YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN'T
  UNDERSTAND MY LOVE OF DOGS,

   THEN YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
              ME.

      WHAT DOES ONE THING
   HAVE TO DO WITH ANOTHER?

            [SIGHS]

            I THINK
 IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT...

I DON'T KNOW,
WE SHOULD BE...

WE SHOULD RECONSIDER
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

          RECONSIDER?
       WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
          RECONSIDER?

  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
       RECONSIDER WHAT?

                       BAILEY...

         I'M GONNA GO.

             WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
             YOU'RE GOING TO GO?

                   WHERE ARE YOU
                   GOING TO--

             SHIRLEY, COME HERE.

BAILEY...

          GOOD GIRL.

    WATCH YOUR HEAD, ADAM.

DON'T JUST LEAVE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

    I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
       THERE IS TO SAY.

  LISTEN, YOU BASICALLY THINK

      THAT MY PRIORITIES
     ARE ALL OUT OF WHACK,

      BUT YOU'RE MISSING
       WHAT MAKES ME ME.

       NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

 I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS,
    AND IT'S FINE, REALLY.

            "FINE?"

   "FINE" IS LIKE SOMETHING
  YOU SAY ABOUT THE WEATHER.

  IT'S NOT HOW YOU TALK ABOUT
    SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE.

        BAILEY, JUST...

     PLEASE, JUST TELL ME
        WHAT YOU WANT.

        I WANT SHIRLEY.

WHAT?

               COME HERE, GIRL.

YOU CAN'T JUST
 TAKE SHIRLEY.

        YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT
        YOU GOT HER ONLY FOR ME.

     BESIDES, NO DOG SHOULD LIVE
     WHERE THEY'RE NOT WELCOME.

      ERIC. WHY DIDN'T HE
         JUST TELL ME

   THAT HE DIDN'T WANT A DOG
      IN THE FIRST PLACE?

    IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US
   SO MUCH TIME AND TROUBLE.

I THINK HE DID,

JUST NOT IN A WAY
YOU WERE HEARING.

              MM.

          TO BE FAIR,

        I HAVEN'T BEEN
  COMPLETELY HONEST WITH HIM.

    I SAID "YES" TO GETTING
            MARRIED
     WHEN I REALLY MEANT,
           "MAYBE."

     WELL, NOW THAT WE'RE
 ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS,

         WHY DID YOU?

     BECAUSE MEN LIKE ERIC
     DON'T GROW ON TREES.

    I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON
             THAT.

     NO OFFENSE TO TRAVIS.

          NONE TAKEN.

         I WISH TRAVIS
  HAD HALF OF ERIC'S INTEREST

         IN MARRIAGE.

     THERE IS SUCH A THING

          AS TOO MUCH
  OF A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW.

 YOU KNOW, ON OUR FIRST DATE,

    WHEN ERIC BROUGHT THOSE
           PICTURES
  OF THE PERFECT GOLF SWING,

       I THOUGHT, "LOOK,
 THIS GUY IS SUPER-PREPARED."

   BUT... A BIT OF OVERKILL,
            RIGHT?

GOOD.

    THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
        A DEAL-BREAKER.

         JUST KEEP IT IN CHECK.

                  EVERYONE'S
                  GOT SOMETHING.

     SPEAKING OF TOO MUCH
      OF A GOOD THING...

                         MM-MM.

IF I MUST.

          [CHUCKLING]

        OH, GOOD GIRLS,

  SAFELY CROSSING THE STREET.

          COLE, HEY.

         BAILEY, HEY!

  SO, WHATEVER HAPPENED WITH
     YOUR BOYFRIEND'S DOG?

    I NEVER HEARD FROM YOU.

                       OH, UH--

WHOA, WHO'S THIS?

       THIS IS ERIC'S--
         MY SHIH TZU.

                       SHIRLEY.

     SHIRLEY THE SHIH TZU?
            SWEET!

           [LAUGHS]

  THOUGH HE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
     THE LITTLE DOG TYPE.

     NO, HE'S NOT, REALLY.

             HE'S NOT
             THE "ANY DOG" TYPE.

    HE JUST GOT HER FOR ME,
             SO...

     WELL, YOU GOTTA LOVE
         THAT, RIGHT?

           UH, I DO?

        TAKING IN A DOG
        IS A HUGE DEAL.

      IF SOMEONE WENT TO
 THAT KIND OF TROUBLE FOR ME,

  I'D BE LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU
             DOING
    THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?"

   EVEN IF SHE DIDN'T REALLY
          LOVE DOGS?

  AS LONG AS SHE REALLY LOVED
              ME,
      I'D FIGURE IT OUT--

PROVIDED I LOVED HER BACK,
OF COURSE.

            RIGHT.

BUT, YOU KNOW,

I'M A LITTLE PIE-IN-THE-SKY
ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF.

                 YEAH, I THOUGHT
                 I WAS, TOO.

HEY, WATCH THIS.

         ADAM, CATCH.

OH!

                     GOOD CATCH.

             OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

                     GOOD GIRL.

HERE, YOU WANT TO TRY.

       SURE, HERE, TAKE SHIRLEY.

I'LL HOLD THE DOGS, AND...

       OKAY, OKAY, SIT.

         WAIT, WAIT...


HE'S INCHING CLOSER
AND CLOSER.

                 OH, GOOD CATCH!

    COOL, WELL, NEXT TIME,

   WE'LL KICK IT UP A NOTCH
      WITH TENNIS BALLS.

      OH, MY, WE'LL HAVE
   OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US.

SHIRLEY...

AW, GREAT DOG.

                   YEAH, SHE IS.

    IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

                       YOU TOO.

           COME ON.

           COME ON,
  WE'RE GOING TO GO HOME NOW.

         <i> THAT IS NOT</i>
    <i> THE END OF THE STORY.</i>

          IS IT?

           HOW COULD IT BE
           THE END OF THE STORY?

         WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY

             SHE'S WEARING
             THAT WEDDING DRESS!

        OH, THANK YOU.

       LOOK WHO JUST GOT
       HIS SECOND WIND.

       CONTINUE, PLEASE.

    WELL, THE NEXT FEW DAYS
    WERE PRETTY EMOTIONAL.

      ERIC KEPT CALLING.

     I COULDN'T ANSWER THE
           PHONE...

       OKAY, EASY, GUYS.
           COME ON.

   WE'VE GOT TO LET SHIRLEY
       KEEP UP WITH US.

           COME ON.

    COME ON, SHIRLEY GIRL.

       OH, I KNOW, HEY,
        WE'RE SO CLOSE.

              HI.

   I WANTED TO SEE SHIRLEY,
      AND GIVE HER THESE.

          OH. WELL--

      COME HERE, SHIRLEY.

WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE, UH,

         LIKES TULIPS.

  EXCEPT MAYBE TO NIBBLE ON.

  YEAH, WHAT WAS I THINKING?

       DO YOU KNOW WHAT,
        I HAVE AN IDEA,

 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THEM?

 I GUESS I'D HATE TO SEE THEM
         GO TO WASTE.

     HERE.

                         TRADE?

YEAH. [CHUCKLING]

                     I GOT HER.

             SO, HOW IS SHIRLEY?

ASK HER YOURSELF.

                  HEY, GIRL,
                  HOW YOU DOING?

                           HUH?

                 SHE SEEMS GOOD.

      YEAH, SHE IS GOOD.

               [GROANING]
               THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

SHE'S LOOSENED UP A BIT,
YOU KNOW.

ADAM HAS THAT EFFECT
ON OTHER DOGS.

                           YEAH?

    YEAH.

               BAILEY, I HAVE
               TO SAY SOMETHING.

                   I MAY NOT...

               LOVE DOGS AS MUCH
               AS YOU DO, BUT...

                 I DO LOVE YOU.

     HOW MUCH? [CHUCKLES]

       VERY, VERY MUCH.

                     AND I'M...

         I'M JUST HOPING
         YOU STILL LOVE ME, TOO.

         I DO.

     I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

           -YOU DO?
            -I DO.

     THIS IS REALLY GREAT,
         YOU KNOW WHY?


               BECAUSE ACCORDING
               TO MY SCHEDULE,

         WE STILL CAN SEND OUT
         THE INVITATIONS IN TIME

          AND MAKE OUR
          ORIGINAL WEDDING DATE.

THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

                         I KNOW.

             INVITATIONS, CHECK.

                   CAKE, CHECK--

WAIT, DID WE DECIDE ON

A LEMON CAKE
WITH VANILLA FROSTING,

 OR THE VANILLA CAKE
WITH LEMON FROSTING?

    WHAT? NO, NO, NEITHER.

    WE CHOSE THE RASPBERRY
    BLACK SATIN FUDGE CAKE.

NO, YOU CHOSE THAT ONE.

I SAID SOMETHING LIGHTER
WOULD BE NICE.

          BUT, BABE,
          THAT BLACK SATIN CAKE,

              I MEAN, THAT MAKES
              A STATEMENT.

      AND, DON'T FORGET,

      THAT'S CHEF DUBOIS'
      SIGNATURE DESSERT.

  OKAY, PHOTOGRAPHER, CHECK.

     VIDEOGRAPHER, CHECK.

        WALTZ LESSONS,
        WALTZ LESSONS--

   WE STILL HAVE TO SCHEDULE
            THOSE.

OKAY, SO,

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WALTZ.

        I'M ENVISIONING
      SOMETHING DIFFERENT

     FOR OUR FIRST DANCE.

   LOOK, BAILEY, WE STRANGS
   ARE A FAMILY OF WALTZERS.

     I MEAN, THIS HAS BEEN
      A WEDDING TRADITION

      FOR, LIKE, FOREVER!

  YOU'LL LOVE IT, YOU'LL SEE.

                   MUSIC, CHECK.

           WEDDING DRESS, CHECK.

           AMBER'S DRESS, CHECK.

UNCHECK.

SHE'S REALLY--SHE'S NOT
INTO THE WHOLE SUIT THING.

SO, ONE OF THOSE OTHER
OPTIONS
THAT WE LOOKED AT,

THE LIGHTER-COLORED ONES?

       YEAH, BUT THE WHOLE POINT

      WAS FOR HER DRESS TO MATCH
      THE ROSES IN THE
      CENTERPIECES,

      SO, I'M SORRY,
      THAT ONE'S NOT NEGOTIABLE.

    [MUTTERING] GOT THOSE.
          HAIRCUTS...

           DID I GET A HAIRCUT?

                     YES, I DID.

                BAILEY,
                FOR PETE'S SAKE,

   YOU HAVE TO STOP SHAKING,

    I CANNOT GET THIS DRESS
          ZIPPED UP.

IT'S SO COLD.

  ISN'T IT FREEZING IN HERE?

          MM-MM, NO,
  IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY WARM.

     THE ONLY THING THAT'S
           FREEZING
      ARE THE DAIQUIRIS.

       OKAY, THERE, HOW'S THAT?

         OH, SO TIGHT.

     IT'S SO MUCH TIGHTER
         THAN IT WAS.

    I CAN'T REALLY BREATHE.

HONEY, IT FITS YOU
PERFECTLY.

YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.

            OKAY...

           AND DONE.

         THANKS. OKAY.

           GORGEOUS.

                         THANKS.

       I AM SO SORRY...

        ABOUT THE SUIT.

             AH...

       [SIGHS NERVOUSLY]

           OKAY, UM,

I'M GOING TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS AND FIND TRAVIS.

[SIGHS EMOTIONALLY]

      OKAY, NO, I PROMISE
   I WON'T CRY UNTIL AFTER.

YEAH.

     YOU LOOK SO GORGEOUS.

         OH, BAILEY...

YOU LOOK
GORGEOUS.

            THANKS.

BYE.

SHE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW,

  YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST BRIDE
             EVER.

 OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

   I'VE SEEN YOUR PICTURES.

  HOW ARE YOU FEELING, HONEY?

     BESIDES THE FACT THAT
    I CAN'T REALLY BREATHE

     AND I MIGHT PASS OUT?

                       I'M GOOD.

        YEAH, I'M GOOD.

     I SO WISH YOUR FATHER
     WAS HERE TO SEE THIS.

HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO PROUD OF YOU.

               WHEN DID YOU KNOW
               THAT HE WAS...

      YOU KNOW, THE ONE?

          [CHUCKLES]

        YOU KNOW WHAT,

        IT WAS ACTUALLY

WHEN WE WERE
STANDING UP THERE

ABOUT TO GET MARRIED.

I LOOKED AT HIM

LIKE I HAD NEVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE,

AND I JUST KNEW,

HE WAS MY SOULMATE.

AND HE WOULD LOVE ME
FOR EXACTLY WHO I WAS,

AND ME, HIM,
COME RAIN OR SHINE.

     HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU

      YOU'RE THE BEST MOM
         IN THE WORLD?

      YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

    [CHUCKLES FONDLY] OKAY.

          ALL RIGHT.

BEAUTIFUL, ARE YOU READY

TO BECOME
MRS. ERIC STRANG?

  I'LL BE OUT IN ONE MINUTE.

I LOVE YOU.

               I LOVE YOU, TOO.

           [SIGHING]

    WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

  AM I DOING THE RIGHT THING?

     IS ERIC MY SOULMATE,
   COME RAIN OR COME SHINE?

AM I HIS?

     I'M TALKING TO DOGS.

OKAY.

LET'S GET MARRIED!

             [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

   DEAR FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

  WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY

   TO WITNESS AND CELEBRATE

   THE JOINING OF BAILEY AND
             ERIC

      IN HOLY MATRIMONY.

             AND DO YOU, BAILEY,

           TAKE ERIC

      TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY
        WEDDED HUSBAND?

   FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE,

    FOR RICHER, FOR POORER,

          IN SICKNESS
        AND IN HEALTH,

    TO LOVE, AND TO CHERISH

    TILL DEATH DO YOU PART?

   [STAMMERS QUIETLY] N-NO.

           NO, I...

      NO, I DON'T. I'M...

      ERIC, I'M SO SORRY.

      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

I WANTED TO BE

    WHO YOU WANT ME TO BE,

          BUT I'M...

     I'M NOT THAT PERSON.

WE CAN'T...

       DO IT LIKE THAT.

            BAILEY, WHAT ARE YOU
            TALKING ABOUT?

              YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
              BELIEVE THAT.

      NOW, JUST, COME ON,
    GET IT TOGETHER, AND--

    I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.

ANY WOMAN
WOULD BE SO LUCKY

   TO BE STANDING HERE WITH
             YOU,

        BUT YOU'VE HAD
   THIS WHOLE THING PLANNED
             OUT,

   YOU KNOW, YOUR WHOLE LIFE
         PLANNED OUT,

         AND IT JUST--
      IT WASN'T MY PLAN.

        WHAT ARE YOU...

         I'M SO SORRY.

          COME HERE.

           COME ON.

 [CROWD MURMURING IN CONCERN]

        [RAIN POURING]

        <i> SO, I GUESS...</i>

  I JUST REALIZED, YOU KNOW,

  THAT I CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT
              MAN

        BY TRYING TO BE
   THE RIGHT WOMAN FOR HIM.

I JUST HAVE TO BE...

YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
BE TRUE TO YOURSELF,

       AND THEN THE REST
 FALLS INTO PLACE, HOPEFULLY.

               THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,
               BAILEY.

SEE, HE'S JUST A BIG
SOFTIE AFTER ALL.

           AW...

                     [CHUCKLING]

           [GIGGLES]

        YOU TWO REALLY
  LOVE EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU?

YEAH, WE'RE, UH,
WE'RE PRETTY INSEPARABLE.

      YEAH, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
      OF THIS JOINT, EITHER.

OH, HONEY...

    I HOPE TO SOMEDAY HAVE
        WHAT YOU HAVE.

                  YOU KNOW WHAT,
                  SWEETIE,

I WAS JUST ABOUT YOUR AGE
WHEN I STARTED WORKING HERE.

I WOULD STAND BEHIND
THAT COUNTER EVERY DAY,

              WAITING FOR
              MY PRINCE CHARMING

TO COME WALKING
THROUGH THE DOOR.

GUYS CAME IN,
AND GUYS WENT OUT,

AND GUESS WHAT?

THERE WAS NOT
A SINGLE PRINCE AMONG THEM.

              [CHUCKLES]
              AND THEN, ONE DAY,

           RIGHT OUTTA THE BLUE,

THIS ONE SAYS TO ME,

"HOW ABOUT
WE GO OUT SOMETIME?"

AND I'M LIKE,
"GO OUT WHERE?"

           [LAUGHS]

HE'S LIKE,
"ON A DATE, DUMMY!"

          [LAUGHING]

AND PRETTY MUCH

           THE REST IS HISTORY.

ANCIENT HISTORY.

FOR YOURSELF.

           THE POINT IS, HONEY,

       SOMETIMES--

       SOMETIMES, THOSE ANSWERS
       ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

                WE JUST HAVE TO
               OPEN UP OUR EYES

                   AND SEE THEM.

      [DINER]: A KIND AND
           BEAUTIFUL
      WOMAN ONCE TOLD ME

     "DOGS LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY.

     "IF YOU FIND SOMEONE
 WHO CAN LOVE YOU LIKE A DOG,

    YOU JUST MAY HAVE FOUND
          TRUE LOVE."

             COLE?

HI, BAILEY.

          GOOD STORY.

   [GROANS IN EMBARRASSMENT]

   YOU'VE BEEN SITTING THERE
        THE WHOLE TIME?

OH, HONEY,
HE'S HERE EVERY NIGHT.

REALLY. TILL CLOSING
AND SOMETIMES AFTER.

            SITTING OVER THERE,
           HUNCHED OVER A BOOK.

             YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

YEAH.

      WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
          SOMETHING?

I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS I JUST ENJOYED

   HEARING THE SOUND OF YOUR
            VOICE.

                           AH...

    OKAY, I'M... I'M STILL
     KIND OF EMBARRASSED,
           ACTUALLY,

  ABOUT EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU

                 AT THAT PARTY.

       ARE YOU KIDDING?

      THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

     BESIDES, I'VE HAD THE
           BIGGEST,
     BADDEST CRUSH ON YOU

          EVER SINCE.

   OKAY, SO NOW YOU'VE HEARD
        ALL OF THAT...

        WHAT CAN I SAY?

         I'M A GONER.

      WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
          ASK ME OUT?

    YOU WERE ALWAYS SEEING
           SOMEONE,
 OR BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE,

   AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
            RIGHT.

    THAT'S SO NOT WHO I AM.

      I REALLY HAVE NEVER
      DATED AROUND MUCH.

       IT'S JUST BEEN--

             IT'S A CRAZY TIME.

  WELL, I THINK YOU'RE GREAT,
     JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

     [CHUCKLING AWKWARDLY]

          [CHUCKLING]

              [CLUCKING TO DOGS]
              HERE WE GO.

THAT WAS
QUITE THE STORY.

           [LAUGHS] WELL, YEAH.

    SO...

WHERE ARE YOU
GOING NOW?

                           UM...

                   I DON'T KNOW.

         I'M NOT TIRED, THOUGH.

 WELL, HOW WOULD
YOU AND THE DOGS

LIKE TO MEET
MY NEW BEAGLE, FLAPJACK?

                       A BEAGLE?

                       OH, BOY.

                 I THINK
                 WE'D LIKE THAT.

   COOL.

                     WHICH WAY?

                     ALL RIGHT.

             [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

                     YOU MUST BE
                     FREEZING.

               ADAM... GOOD BOY.

             [â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]
