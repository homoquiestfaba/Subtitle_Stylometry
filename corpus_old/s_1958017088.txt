{\an8}[man over PA] <i>Welcome to the store.</i>

<i>Are you a Busy Beaver?</i>

{\an8}[Otto] No, I am not a Busy Beaver.

{\an8}[gentle music playing over speakers]

<i>Are you a Frequent Beaver?</i>

<i>Join our rewards club for savings.</i>

<i>You can get your teeth
into our dam good deals.</i>


<i>Don't forget:</i>

<i>If you need help, ask a Beaver.</i>

Oh. Oh.

{\an8}Hey. Oh.
Can I, uh, help you with that, sir?

Do you think
I don't know how to cut rope?

No, it's just we usually do that for ya.

Do you think I'm gonna cut myself
and bleed all over your floor and sue you?

No.

Then I don't need your help.

{\an8}Have an excellent day.

[cuts rope]

{\an8}<i>I'm a Busy Beaver.</i>


[scanner beeps]

Did you, um, find everything
you were lookin' for today?

Yes.

Good.

Let's see here.

Uh, your total is 3.47.

You charged me for 6 feet of rope.

Oh, yes, it's 99Â¢ a yard.

I didn't get 2 yards. I got 5 feet.

Yeah, we don't charge by the foot.
We charge by the yard.

99Â¢ a yard is 33Â¢ a foot,
times 5, that's 1.65.

You charged me $1.98.


No, I know, but I can't put it into
the computer the way that you just said.

What the hell kind of computer
can't do simple math?

-Can I speak to your manager?
-He's at lunch.

Lunch. All anyone cares about
these days is lunch.

-Is there anyone else in charge?
-You want the assistant manager?

-Yes, I'd like the assistant manager.
-'Kay.

[keypad beeping]

[over PA] Hey, Taylor?

Taylor? To the front register.

What's up?

Hey, Taylor.

This is the assistant manager?
How old is she?

Shouldn't you be in gym class?

Sorry, what?


Let me cover that extra 33Â¢ for you.

Sir, I do not want your 33Â¢.
And this is not about 33Â¢.

This is about the fact that I got 5 feet
of rope because I want 5 feet of rope.

And I shouldn't have to pay
for 6 feet of rope if I don't want 6 feet.

Did you want another foot of rope?

[lilting pensive music playing]


[beeping stops]

{\an8}[razor buzzing]

{\an8}[lilting pensive music continues]



Hm.

How hard can this be?


{\an8}[groans]

{\an8}That bike goes over here.

{\an8}Hey! What the hell?

That's mine.

{\an8}-It belongs in the bike rack.
-I was only gone half a minute.

Next time, I'll lock it up
in the lost and found.

{\an8}Grumpy old bastard.

{\an8}Jeez.

Not on the mirror.

[shoes squeaking]

-Hey, Otto!
-[grunts]

{\an8}[squeaking continues]

{\an8}[woman] Okay.

[lilting pensive music continues]


Hey!



[dog barking]

Don't you dare let that little rat dog
piss on my walkway again.

{\an8}-I know it was you.
-Ignore him, Prince.

{\an8}He's a nasty, bitter old man.
And he has no idea who's doing that.

Well, it was one of you.

And tell that useless boyfriend of yours
to stop stretching his groin in public.

{\an8}Looks like a 14-year-old Romanian gymnast,
for God's sakes.

[cat meows]

Go on. Get outta here.

Go.

-[indistinct chatter]
-[machinery beeping]


What's all this?

It's, well, retirement cake, I guess.
Call it what you like.


"Have fun."

Doing what?

Have fun with the rest of your life.
We wanted to, you know...

Celebrate?

Yes! Well, no.

Give you a nice send-off.

"Nice."

Come on, Otto.

You're the one who decided to leave.

And you did get a nice severance package.

You took me off Operations.

You cut back on my hours.

You made Terry,
who I trained, my supervisor.

Terry, who can barely figure out
what year it is without his phone.

So, yes, I took the severance package.

I'm sorry you see it that way.

We all had to adjust after the merger.

But you've been quite an asset
to this company over the years, so--

You have. Reliable as hell.

We're gonna miss
those schedules of yours.


To Otto!

-To Otto!
-To Otto.

Okay, Otto. Want a piece of your face?

-Who's hungry?
-[employees laughing]


No, no.

Hey, hey, wait!

No, no, no. Hey, you cannot use
this road without a permit.

I'm not parking.
I just dropped off a package.

The sign doesn't say
anything about packages, does it?

It says "permits" and you don't have one.

This is not a through street.

Have a nice day, sir.

Every time you come in here

that means one of the residents
can't park in front of their homes!

The other guys don't do this.
The guys with the white trucks.

How come it's always you brown guys?

And I don't mean that racially!

[telephone ringing]

Hello.

[woman's voice]
<i>Oh, hi. Sorry, can you hear me?</i>

Yes.

<i>It's Susan.</i>

Susan who?

<i>I have great news
about your health insurance.</i>

Oh, no, no, no. Robot, robot, robot!

[lilting pensive music playing]

Well, who do I have to talk to
to get this phone number disconnected?


Can you transfer me
or should I press a number?

Well, I have been listening
to that music for seven minutes.


I would like the electricity shut off
at this residence.

<i>-Are you moving home?
</i>-No, I am cancelling the account.

A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.

And why can't you refund me
for the six days?

O-T-T-O.

Oh, it's policy.

Well, my policy is that
if I'm going to pay for six days of gas,

then I will use six days of gas.

Then we are done here.

[music fades]

Idiots.

[vacuum whirring]

[quirky ominous music playing]

[drill whirring]

[woman speaking in Spanish outside]

[Otto groans]

Okay.

[speaking in Spanish]

[in English] Go, go, go. Stop. Go.

Okay. Yeah. Stop.

Back. You're in the blind spot,
be careful. Use the Force.

Good, good.
No, you're going on the sidewalk.

Okay. [speaking in Spanish]

[in English] Back, back, back.

Go away.

[speaking in Spanish]

-[radar beeping]
-[in English] Stop. Stop.

[speaking in Spanish]


Ah, shit.

What the hell is he doing?

[in English] Yes! Exactly!
That's exactly what I was saying.

-Hey, you can't just drive here.
-[radar beeping, then stops]

I'm not driving.
Am I driving the car? No.

You can't just bring a car
on this street without a permit.

No, we have a parking permit.
Right here. See?

What the hell's it doing in your pocket?!

Well, I'm the driver.

We're renting here. Yeah.

{\an8}In 206.

That doesn't mean you can back
the trailer up to your front door.

No, I wasn't. I was, uh, parallel parking.

Parallel to what?

Yeah, that, uh, didn't go so well, huh?

I'll just give it another try.

-Oh, my God.
-[speaking in Spanish]



[speaking in Spanish]


[Marisol in English]
Keep backing away. Keep backing away.

Now go away more.


[speaks in Spanish]

[in English]
The other way, but first the other way.

-[Otto] Easy.
<i>-Exactamente.</i>

-[Otto] Easy, easy.
-[Marisol] Uh-huh. Good.

No. No, no. What? No!

-No, no, no! Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!
-[yelling]

-Stop! Stop. Get outta the car.
-[engine turns off]

-Get outta the car.
-I'm sorry.

How you could make it
this far through life

without knowing how to back up a trailer.

My God, a dog with one front paw and
cataracts coulda done better than that.

And an automatic, of course.
Give me the keys.

Oh, they're in the cupholder.

It's a push-button start.

No, I knew that.

-[engine starts]
-[radar beeping]

What the hell is that?

Uh, that's the radar.

The trailer's too close
to the side of the car.

That's why it's still beeping, but--

Okay.

Hello.

Hello.

What's your name?

-Otto.
-Otto?

Otto. O-T-T-O.

I'm Abbie, O-T-T-O.

[laughs softly] And I'm Luna.

Nice to meet you.

[Marisol & Tommy speaking in Spanish]

[in English] Oh, that was good, huh?

He just did it in one shot, huh?

<i>-Perfecto!
</i>-Thank you, sir.

Anyone who thinks
they need to use radar to back up a car

shouldn't be allowed to drive one.

They shouldn't be allowed
to use the radio.

That's what I said.

And the permit goes on
the rear-view mirror. Not in your pocket!

-[in English] Okay, okay.
-Got it.

-Bye! Thank you!
-Thank you, sir. That was very nice.

Idiot.

[electricity powering down]

[groans softly]



All right.


Come on, sweeties.

<i>Chiquitita, </i>take your stuff.


[poignant music playing]


[young Otto] <i>Three shelves.</i>

-How many more boxes of books do you have?
-[Sonya] Seven or eight.

"Then I'll build you another bookcase."

[young Otto]
<i>Then I'll build you another bookcase.</i>

[knocking on door]

-[Marisol] Hi.
-[Tommy] Hey.

Hi. Otto.

Right? Yes?

Otto.

Yeah, that's what I said.
No? What did I say--?

It doesn't matter what you said.
Otto. O-T-T-O.

-Ah! Otto.
-Otto.

Otto. Okay, so it's the same forward
that is backwards.

-Otto.
-It's Otto, Mari.

It's just you don't hear
that name very often.

I do.

Okay. If we're interrupting,
we can always come back.

What is it you want?

I brought you some food.

Why?

Because you looked hungry.

That's why we go so well together.

She loves to cook,
and I like to eat everything.

[Marisol & Tommy chuckle]

Anyway, we just, uh...

We wanted
to properly introduce ourselves

because we're gonna be neighbours
and everything, so...

-So...
-Okay.

-Okay.
-Bye.

My name is Marisol.

And I'm Tommy.

Otto.

Are you always this unfriendly?

I'm not unfriendly.

-I'd say you're a little unfriendly.
-I'm not unfriendly.

<i>-Un poquito.
</i>-I am not.

No? Okay, you're not.

No, no, no, no. You're not unfriendly.

Every word you say is like a warm cuddle.

It really is.

Enjoy it.

What is it?

Be careful with the <i>salsa,</i> please.

It's, um, <i>pollo con mole</i>.

It's really good.

It's a Mexican dish.

I'm Mexican. [speaks in Spanish]

[in English] I was born in El Salvador
because my father is from there.

But my mom is Mexican,
so we went to first Mexico and then--

-And you?
-I'm an IT consultant.

[speaking in Spanish]

Oh, I'm from Anaheim.

Oh, from Anaheim.

Anaheim, yeah.

Yeah. El Paso.

Okay, well, I have some things
I need to do.

Excuse me, Mr Otto.

You wouldn't have an Alvin wrench
I could borrow, would you?

You mean an Allen wrench.

No, an Alvin wrench.

-It's Allen wrench.
-[Marisol] Allen wrench.

It's "Allen" wrench, right?
It's Allen wrench.

It's Alvin.

All morning, "Alvin wrench, Alvin wrench."

Honey, it's Alvin, trust me.

Everybody else I know
calls it an Alvin wrench.

-Everybody else you know is wrong.
-Oh, yeah? You wanna Google it?

My God.

Google it! Google it!

Google it. <i>Wikipediale. Wikipediale.</i>


No, my phone. You use your phone.

[lilting music playing]

Do you know what size you need?

Ah, just the usual size.

Take the set.

-Thank you.
-Thank you.

We go because you have things to do, so...

What do you want, huh?

[music fades]

Mmm.

Mmm!

Hm.

Mmm.

[haunting music playing]


That's a Chevy engine for you.

<i>Dependable.</i>

<i>Not enough you can depend on
in this world.</i>

Dad, this is Otto.

[music intensifies]

That's enough now, darling.


-[groaning]
-[music fades]


Huh.

Two for $8?

[birds singing]

Maybe I should just run myself
over with a car. That'll work.

Found some of the flowers you like.

Pink.


On sale. Two for 8 bucks.

I'm sorry I didn't get 'em here earlier.

Got distracted.

By some new neighbours.

Nitwit husband.

Didn't even know an Allen wrench
from one of the Chipmunks.

Renters, of course.

No commitment to anything.

I know, I know.
Maybe they can't afford to buy yet.

But what will they do
when those real estate bastards

decide to tear down their house

and put up more
of those ricky-ticky condos, huh?

It's gonna happen. I promise you.

They're already driving around the gates,

driving right across the grass.


Dye & Merika.

What idiot thought that was a good name
for a real estate company?

Sounds like "dying America."

It is, of course.

Can't even buy
a decent screw hook anymore.

Or rope by the foot.

Nothing works when you're not home.

[poignant music playing]


I suspect you have
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

which is a genetic enlargement of the--

I know.

My father had it.

Well, you'll likely be around
a good long time,

but I'm afraid
your military prospects end here.

<i>Next.</i>

[poignant music continues]

One return ticket to Pittsburgh, please.

That'll be 1.10.



[train bell clanging]

Hey, you dropped your book!

Miss, you dropped your book! Hey!

[conductor blowing whistle]

[hopeful music playing]

Is that mine?

What?

{\an8}-Yes. I saw you dropped it, so I...
-[chuckles]

Thank you so much.

I'm halfway through reading it.
I would hate not knowing how it ends.

Oh, here. Why don't you join me?

I'm Sonya.

I'm Otto.

It was my father's name.

I'm on my way
to visit my father right now.

I go every Thursday.

Do you take this train a lot?

Oh, no, I had to come into town
for my Army physical.

Oh, God.

Oh, that must be so hard, not knowing
what you're gonna face over there.

-When are you leaving?
-I'm not--

Not for a while.


Thank you.

All right, thank you.

I'm afraid you're on the wrong train.
This is an eastbound ticket.

I must have, um...

I'll get off at the next station.

Uh, how much is it?

Uh, $1.75.

One.

Here. I have some change.

Thank you.

There you go. Thank you. Have a good day.

A quarter to spare.

It's 1964.

-It's pure silver.
-Oh?

Keep it, then. It's lucky.

Yes, it is.

[poignant music playing]

[door closes]

[lilting music playing]


Hey, Otto! A little late
for your morning rounds, isn't it?

No.

No? Aren't you supposed to be at work?

[shoes squeaking]

No.

Oh. Cool.
You wanna come over for lunch, then?

-[hip-hop music blaring over car speakers]
-Lunch.

Yeah.


Well, it's pork tenderloin,
in case you change your mind!

No, no, no, no.

Hey, excuse me.

It was you.

This is a private road, and these gates
are to keep down the flow of traffic.

Not so idiot drivers can go around them
and tear up the grass.

-[music stops]
-Okay. You got me. I'm with Dye & Merika.

I'm gonna have the groundskeeper
come down and fix that up for ya, okay?

Good as new. Even better.
You have a good one now, okay?

The rules are here for a reason.

[music resumes]

I know what you guys are up to.

Okay, Mr Anderson. Whatever you say.

Keep up the neighbourhood watch.

-[dog barking]
-Get out here, you little bugger! [grunts]

Come on. Yeah.

Get out here!


and I swear I'll dropkick that little
rat dog of yours right over the roof.

No, I'm not throwing it at your house.
That nasty cat scratched Prince.

I'm gonna kill that piece of shit.

No, you're not.


It's probably full of all sorts
of disgusting diseases.

So are you, most likely.
I don't throw rocks at you.

Andy.

-[Andy] What's up?
-Did you hear what he just said this time?

how he talks to me.

Get outta here while you can.

I'm not your friend.

the old people on this street into a home.

The sooner the better!

[knocking on door]

[Marisol & Tommy speaking in Spanish]

-[in English] Hello.
-What now?

[in English]
I just wanted to bring the wrenches back.

-I found one that came with the furniture.
-Congratulations.

And I made you some <i>salpores de arroz</i>.

Is that chicken and mole?

No. These are Salvadoran cookies.
They were my father's favourite, so...

They're delicious.
You're gonna love 'em.

Yes, because I made them.

Also, Otto, I was wondering
if you have a ladder I can borrow.

Our window is jammed.

Why do you need a ladder?

Well, it's the one up there.

It won't open.

And you're gonna try to open it
from the outside?

Yeah. Right.

I'll get my coat.

Okay. Thank you.

I like how his hands are waving.

Let's put the arm in.

[Marisol speaking in Spanish]

-Good.
-Anita.

Uh, Otto, hate to bother you,
but, um, we don't have any heat.

Could you come take a look?

Try bleeding your radiators.

How would I go about that?

By bleeding the radiators.

Otto. Don't be rude.

I wasn't being rude.

Well, it's hard to tell the difference
sometimes with Otto.

Yeah.

By the way, we, uh, just moved to 206.

-I'm Marisol.
-I'm Tommy.

-Welcome, honey.
-[Tommy] Nice meeting you.

I'm Anita.

My husband, Reuben,
is the one who used to handle the heat.

-Okay.
-But we always knew a day would come

when he wouldn't be able to handle things
around the house any longer.

Maybe Reuben should have thought of that
when he organised his coup.


That was a long time ago.

A coup?

It was a misunderstanding.

It was a coup.

Otto, can't you just go
breathe Anita's radiators for her?

No. Because you don't breathe radiators.

You bleed them.

-Honey, look at this ramp.
-[Anita] That's Sonya's.

-This is what we needed for the trailer.
-Put that down.

Put that down!
Who said you could touch that?!

-[Tommy] Sorry.
-All of you get outta here. Go, go.

Take your ladder and go.
Get outta here. All of you.

-[Marisol] Okay.
-[Tommy] Thank you.

Watch out.

-[speaking in Spanish]
-Right. Right.

-Thank you!
-[in English] Thank you!

[Marisol speaking in Spanish]

[cat meows]

No. What are you doing in here?

How did you get in here? Come on.

Come on. Go! Get outta there.

No, get out. Get out of there.

Come on, go.

-Hey.
-[meowing]

Let go!

-Let go.
-[hisses]


You scratch me, I'll bite you.

-That'll teach you.
-[cat grumbles]

Stupid cat.

-Hi, Otto!
-Hi, Otto!

-[both giggling]
-[Abbie] O-T-T-O.

Hm.

[knocking on door]

[jazz music playing over speakers]

Otto. Um...

I loaned you my garden hose last August.

If you give it back to me,
I'll bleed your radiators for you.

Come in.

So those new neighbours of yours,
they seem quite lovely, don't you think?

Lovely.

Yeah, well, you may have
some more new neighbours soon enough.

The realty people,
they've been telling us...

Reuben and I have to move out.

No, that's a load of crap.

They don't own this house. You do.

Yeah, well, that's what I said.

They, uh, have been
talking to our boy, Chris.


Now he's saying that I can
no longer take care of Reuben,

that he needs to be
in a special care place.

And I should move into a retirement home.

What does Chris know about it?
He's an idiot. He always has been.

They can't make you do anything.

Does he even know we're here?

Of course he does.

Don't let him fool you.

He's still in there.

Um...

Let me go find your hose.

is falling apart these days.

They don't even have
a homeowners' association anymore.

No one left to keep things running.

Not like we did.

Now, just to be clear...

I still haven't forgiven you.

I just didn't realise
you would fall to shit so quickly.

Now...

they're tearing apart
everything we worked so hard to build.

I haven't even left yet,
and they're trying to erase us.

Well, I am not staying around
to see that happen.

I'm leaving.

-For good.
-[Jimmy] You ready for lunch?

I'm making that creamed corn you like.

Oh, thank you.

Thank you, Otto.
I'm sorry it took so long to give it back.

Um, you wanna stay for lunch?

Yeah, Anita made a pork tenderloin.

No, I have a lot of things I have to do.

[Reuben grunting]

Reuben, what are you doing, hon?

[Reuben & Otto grunting]

-Let go.
-[Anita] What are you doing?

-Let go.
-[Anita] Reuben. Reuben.

-Let...
-[Anita] What are you doing?

...go.

[poignant music playing]

[door slams]


[lilting determined music playing]

Try opening it from the inside a little.

It's higher than I thought.

I'm a little bit dizzy, honey.

[duct tape tearing]

[music fades]


Mmm.

Mmm. Mmm.

[radio turns on]

[stations changing]

["Til You're Home" playing on radio]

to take the next one.

Otto.

It was your father's name.

You remembered.

Did you have to go back
to the military centre?

No, I wanted to pay you back
for the train ticket.

Wouldn't it be nicer
if you invited me to dinner?

<i>â™ª The best gift of this life â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Is to see you up close â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª All these moments I've found â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Til I see you, my love â™ª</i>

[song ends]

[diners chattering]

So, what kinds of things interest you?

Interest me like...?

What are you passionate about?

Machines. Engines.

I like knowing how things work.

<i>I like knowing how things work.</i>

What each part does
to make a car run smoothly.

It's more complicated than people realise.

A carburettor has to mix gas and air
in just the right combination,

and then the spark plug
has to ignite that mixture,

which drives the piston

and the connecting rods
and the drive shaft--

Where did you learn so much about cars?

From my father.

It's all we really talked about.
He was a good dad.

Dependable.

He passed away.

Two months ago.

It was sudden.

I'm sorry.


And your mom?

Don't remember her much.

Just how it felt when she was gone.

Why didn't you get an entrÃ©e?


I ate at home.

Why?

[tender music playing]

So you could order whatever you wanted.

Look, I lied to you.

I'm sorry.

I'm not in the Army.
I couldn't pass my physical.

If I had, at least I'd have a job now,
which is what I was counting on.

But I don't.

And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

I should go.



[pounding on garage door]

[sirens wailing]

Otto!

[pounding continues]

I'm coming.

I'm coming!

What? What do you want?

-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing?

-I'm looking for you.
-Well, you found me.

Can you please take me
to the hospital? Please?

Tommy fell off the ladder,
and the ambulance just took him away.

Well, you can drive yourself
in that imported toaster you call a car.

I don't have a licence.

-How old are you?
-Huh? Thirty.

And you don't have a driver's licence?

I have a driving's permit.

I just never got to the other parts.

How many other parts are there?

[speaks in Spanish]

[in English] Please!

Focus! Please, listen!

Tommy is in the hospital,
and he may be dying as we speak.

So are you gonna drive me to the hospital,
or are you gonna make me take a bus?

-I will drive you to the hospital.
-Thank you.

Was it so hard?

Where are you going?

I'm going to get the children!

The children?

[quirky pensive music playing]


[Luna whooshing]

Bam everywhere. No! No!

Smack, smack, smack!


Are they some kind of superheroes?

Um,<i> Luchador </i>are wrestlers. Yeah.

Wrestlers.

-I found a Mr Bear book!
-So I see.

She wants you to read to her.

Exactly.


'Are you there, Baby Bear?'
Mr Bear says.

'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear.'"

No, talk like a bear.


Bears don't talk.

Um, this one does.

[clears throat, then growls]

[in deep voice]
"'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear?'

[Abbie & Luna giggle]

'Are you there, Baby Bear,
up in that tree?'"

-[growls]
-No, it's an owl!

"'There's nobody here but baby and me.'

'Are you there, Baby Bear,
deep underground?'"


I'm Beppo!

-Hi, Beppo!
-Hi, Beppo!

-Do you want to see a trick?
-Yes!

Actually, I was reading to them.

"Actually, I was reading to them,"
Mr Bear grumbled.

Say, could I borrow a coin, Mr Bear?

Yes, yes, yes, please?

Please, please, please?

-Yes, yes, yes!
-[gasps]

I need this back.

Absolutely.

[speaks in Spanish]

[Beppo sobbing]

He doesn't even own the costume.
That's owned by the hospital.

He's gonna have to pay for that.

Beppo means happiness.
He volunteers his time to be here.

[in English]
Otto. What the hell did you do?

Nothing.

<i>Abuelo </i>Otto hit the clown.

-I did not.
-Yeah, you did.

<i>Abuelo Luchadoro!</i>

<i>Luchadoro!</i>

It was all the clown's fault.

Ooh!

Where is it going?

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Here you go.

Blow.

[both gasp]

Wow! Here it is!

-How'd you do that?
-Oh, it's magic.

-[groans]
-Thank you.

I hope you have a magical day!

-Bye!
-Bye, Beppo!

-[Beppo] Thank you.
-Hang on.

This isn't my quarter.

Well, it came from your ear, sir,
so that's a you problem.

No, this isn't my quarter.

"No, no, no. This is not your quarter."

Look. I gave you a quarter
that I said I needed back.

-You want a dollar?
-And you switched them on me.

-The ol' switcheroo.
-You gave me this quarter.

Is Otto going to get in trouble?

-[Beppo] It's just a quarter.
-[Otto] No, it's not.

-Do you see the copper?
-He's not calling the coppers.

-I gave you a 1964 quarter.
-Please calm down.

I want it back! Where is it?

-You have it on you.
-Officer, help me.


Where is it?

Let go of the clown! Sir! Sir!


[imitates roar]

Where's my toy?

It's in your backpack.

What pocket? There's a million pockets.

What?

My father used to smile like that.

I'm not smiling.

Exactly.

You should never be mean to a clown.

-What about Alvin Wrench, is he coming?
-[gasps] Look!

-Hey, guys!
-Mom, there he is!

[speaks in Spanish]

[in English]
Pull the car up please, so we pick him up.

Otto!

-[Abbie] Yay! Yay!
-[Luna] Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

-[Marisol] Thanks for driving us.
-[Luna] Bye, <i>Abuelo Luchadoro.</i>

-[Tommy] Thank you, Otto.
-Okay, good night.

-[Abbie] Bye!
-[Tommy] Thanks again, Otto.

Bye, then.


Let's go.

They look like a robot leg.


[speaking in Spanish]

Otto!

[in English] Oh, my God, is he dead?

No, he's probably sleeping.

Otto. No, no, no, please.
Please. Please. Take him out. Please.

No, why can't you?

Because I'm pregnant. I cannot handle
the cats because I can get the toxo thing.

Well, he got himself in there.
He can get himself out of there.

Ay. [speaks in Spanish]

[in English] Why are you like that?

I'm not good with cats.

Hey, man. What's going on?

Jimmy. Jimmy. We have a...


We gotta warm you up, buddy!



-Oh, I've got you.
-[meows]

He's so cold.

Where do we go?

-No. But no. Toxo. Otto.
-[Jimmy] Oh.

Okay, let's go. I've got you now.

Otto. Open the door.

Oh, it's all right, buddy.

-It's gonna be okay, <i>chiquitito.
</i>-Poor guy.

Okay. You're okay.

-Snow all over my floor.
-Oh, sorry.

Oh, my God, it's so freezing here.

Okay, how about this one? Please?

No, no. Don't touch that coat.
It'll stay here.

-Okay. Can you please bring a blanket?
-For the cat?

-It's okay. I got this.
-What are you doing?

Oh, body heat works wonders.
I've got plenty of body and heat.

I'm gonna turn on the oven.

You are not putting that cat in my oven.

some heat in the house.

Your counters are so low.
Where did you get them?

I built them.

For Sonya. For my wife.

Ah. Is she short too?

Sonya passed away.

She was a great cook though,
wasn't she?

I used to eat here all the time.

Oh.

I'm sorry.

Well, can you go now?

I have things to do.

Well, it was great seeing ya, as usual.

Oh, hey, who's gonna look after this guy?

You are.

-[meows]
-Aw.

Okay.

[poignant music playing]


[students cheering and whooping]

It was so beautiful too.

Okay, now I'm hungry. Now I'm hungry.

Let's see.

{\an8}"The Board of Regents hereby certifies
that Otto Anderson,

having completed all the requirements
for a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering--"

Would you ever wanna...

get married?

-'Cause if you did...
-Look at me.

[tender music playing]

Now ask me the right way.

Will you...?

Will you marry me?

Yes.

Yes!

-[students cheering and chattering]
-Yes.

Yes.

-Yes! Yes!
-[horn honking]

[Sonya whooping]

[music turns poignant]

[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

[indistinct chatter]

-[man] Oh, my God!
-[woman] Someone call 911.

-[chattering]
-[tense dramatic music playing]

He fell down!

-Somebody help him!
-Get the camera on him. No, take video.

Oh, for God's sake.

-Who's gonna do something?
-Oh, my God, he fell.

-Get him off the tracks. Somebody help.
-Hey! Can you move?

[train horn blows]

You gotta move! Come on! You gotta get up!

Will somebody help me?

-[man] Come on.
-[woman] Film it, film it, film it.

-Get the shot.
-I have him. I see him.

[commuters chattering]

Zoom in on his face.

-Tell me what happened.
-We were going to the museum...

[train horn blaring]

[tense dramatic music continues]


Say hello.

<i>Take a breath, Otto.</i>

<i>Take my hand.</i>


Take my hand now!

Hey, are you out of your mind?
You could have been killed.

[woman 1] Sir, you saved his life.

[woman 2] He saved that guy's life.

You're amazing. Oh, my God.

[woman 1] That was amazing.

[commuters chattering and applauding]

-Whatever. Follow us.
-Anyway, follow us.

[poignant music playing]

Hey.

Are you trying to scare me to death?

Look at this.

Um...

Abbie wanted to make a picture
of her new neighbour.

She wants you to have that.


She always draws you in colour.

What do you mean, "always"?

Hm!

I have a very good idea.

You can be my driver's instructor.

No.

No, no, no.

I don't have time for that.

But don't worry,
I'll pay for the gas and everything.

Hey, there you guys are.
I've been looking for ya everywhere.

-[cat meows]
-Hi, Jimmy. What are you doing?

-Cat in there?
-[Jimmy] Yeah.

-[cat yowls]
-Oh, jeez! Calm down, dude.

-[hissing]
-He really doesn't like this.

Let him out of the box.

Okay. Sorry, buddy.

What do you think you were doing?
Taking him for a walk?

Well, I had to bring him back.
I forgot that I'm allergic.

-So...
-[gasps]

-Oh, Jimmy.
-Yeah. Yeah.

I put oatmeal on it,
and it didn't help at all.

You know what, you come with me.
Tommy has a prescription from last year.

-He found a wasp's nest.
-Are you sure?

-I don't want to be a bother.
-It's okay.

-Don't scratch.
-I feel like I should scratch a little.

Hey, hey, what about the cat?

Uh, looks like he's yours now, Otto.

Love him.

-Get in the box.
-[grumbles]

Get in the box.

Get in the box.


["Til You're Gone" playing]

Sorry I haven't come yet.

It's been harder than I thought to...

And now he's moved in.

I have a cat.

I have to figure out what to do with him.

Then I'll come to you, Sonya. I promise.

{\an8}I miss you.

<i>â™ª And I finally see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª How your love is the best of me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, there's so much
I want you to know â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, there's so much
I want you to know â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Guess I'll wait till you're home â™ª</i>

Oh, no, no, no.

You are not taking over my bed.

This is your bed.

[song ends]

Would you rather sleep outside,

back in the snow?

That can be arranged.

You'll be the best dad
our children could ever hope for.


[quirky pensive music playing]

Hey! Hey!

What?

Is this what you use that bike for?

Yeah. It's my job.

Waiting tables and pumping gas,
that's a job.

I also work nights at a pizza shop
and weekends at a thrift store, so...

Oh.

-Huh.
-You're Mr Anderson, aren't you?

Mm-hm.

You used to come
to presentations at school.

When was that?

Mrs Anderson was my teacher.

She was the first person
that didn't treat me like a freak

'cause I'm transgender.

She was the first
to call me by my new name.

She got the other teachers to do it too.

It really helped me at school.

I won't leave these here anymore.

Hey.

What's your name?

-Malcolm.
-Malcolm.

Otto.

Nice to meet you, Otto.

[horn blares]


Otto! Good news.

Andy's teaching me how to drive.

The wrong way.

-Thank you.
-Of course.

-All right.
-Okay.

-Bye.
-Bye.


You're still in drive! It's an automatic.

You were still in drive.
You gotta put it into park.

In what?

Bye!

Mm.

-[Luna] Help!
-I'm coming!

Saving the princess!

-All right. Coming!
-[Luna] Otto!

Otto's here!
My mom made her <i>salpores</i>.

Hey, Otto. Come in.

I can't stand watching
one idiot teach another how to drive.

You. Put on your coat. It's lesson time.

What?

[speaks in Spanish]

[in English]
You're gonna teach me? Really?

Otto, thank you!

-Mm.
-Thank you.

I'll be right out!

That's really, really nice of you, Otto.
Thank you.

Mm.

I tried once.

Mm.

You guys, okay.

Bye, Otto!

-Mama's going on a ride.
-Be careful, honey.

-Bye, Mama!
-Bye, <i>mi vida</i>.

-[Tommy] Have fun, guys!
-[speaks in Spanish]

Bye, Mama!

All right.

-No more grown-ups. Come on!
-Yay!

Ah. Otto, <i>pero</i> can we go in our car?

Because I've only ever driven automatic.


I'm teaching you how to drive. Get in.

[speaks in Spanish]

[tyres screeching]

Now, coming up on the red light.
You're going to have to stop.

Okay, but I get the clutch, right?

You get the clutch
and then press in on the brake.

-Do I hit the brake or the clutch?
-No, keep the clutch in.

Put in the brake, I put the clutch.

Clutch and brake. And now brake.

-Brake. Brake.
-No. No.

[yells in Spanish]

-[in English] Don't shout at me.
-I am not shouting at you.

Clutch in. It's in, it's in!

We're going to stop, and...

Clutch in, and brake.
Brake. Brake. Brake.

The car is stopped.
Don't hit the car! Brake, brake!

Yes. All right, let go.

Oh, my God.

Brake.

It's clutch and brake.

I suck at this.

-[groans] I suck.
-You're learning.

Oh, my God, I almost hit the car.
It's like this.

It doesn't matter. It's a hybrid.

It's a hybrid, okay.

-Okay, I should move back.
-No, no, no. No.

-You're fine right where you are.
-But I'm very close.

-Doesn't matter.
-I don't need to go back?

-Just wait for the green light.
-[rock music blaring over SUV speakers]

And here we go. So press in on the clutch.

And give it a little gas.

Slowly let out on the clu--

Oh, you're not in gear.

[SUV horn blaring]

Green!

Press in on the clutch, shift into fi--
You don't have to turn the key.

-[man] Go!
-Just press in--

-Oh, my God. [speaks in Spanish]
-Press in on the--

-[horn blaring]
-Slowly let out the clutch,

-then press the gas.
-I can't do this.

-That is all you have to do.
-I can't do this.

No, Otto. Otto, no.

[horn blaring]


Oh, shit.


She's learning how to drive.

Did you not have to learn how to drive?

Calm down, old man. Hey, hey.

I'm not your old man! You son of a bitch!

If you honk that horn one more time,

it'll be the last thing you do.
You hear me? Huh?

<i>Â¿Comprende?</i>

Oh, shit.

Now you listen to me.

You have given birth to two children.
Soon it'll be three.

You have come here
from a country very far away.

You learned a new language,

you got yourself an education
and a nitwit husband

and you are holding that family together.

You will have no problem
learning how to drive.

My God,
the world is full of complete idiots

who have managed to figure it out,
and you are not a complete idiot.

So...

Clutch.

Shift.

Gas.

Drive.

Ah...

Yeah.

<i>Que bueno</i>.

<i>Que bueno</i>.


Just pull up, parallel,

and back the car up until that bumper
is in line with your side-view mirror.

Now straighten out.

Back up all the way up to the curb.

-A little bit.
-Well, a little bit.


Neutral.

[shifter clunks]

-Brake.
-[brake clacks]

Key.

[engine turns off]

Is that it?

That's it.

-[bell rings]
-And we're right on time.

I have it.

-[cheerful music playing over speakers]
-Uh-huh.

-These are semlors.
-[gasps]

-Swedish Ã©clairs.
-Oh!

They're a little messy.

-But let's try.
-Yes.

With your finger.

Mmm!

How did you find this place?

This was Sonya's place.

We used to come here
every Saturday at 1:00.

And then? What?

Go home at 2:00.

I'd wash and wax the car,

and she would grade her papers and cook
and spend the rest of the day reading.

What kind of books?

-Her books.
-[Marisol chuckles]

I tried to read some of them, but...

I'm just...

I'm not into books.

Her friends said
that we were like night and day.

My life was black-and-white
before I met Sonya.

She was the colour.

[tender pensive music playing]

I would have liked her.

She was a force of nature.

She convinced the school
to start up a programme

for the kids that needed extra help.

A lot of kids had problems at home

or, uh, social anxieties.

But by the time Sonya was done with 'em,

they were reciting Shakespeare.

I ran into one of her students,

just the other day.

A kid named Malcolm.

You need more cream.

Okay.

[upbeat music playing]

when we first moved in.</i>

<i>It was like a gift.</i>

Welcome to the neighbourhood.

{\an8}-Hi, I'm Sonya.
-I'm Anita.


[young Otto] So I got my Allen keys...

<i>And Reuben and I were a lot alike.</i>

Hey! Slow down!

<i>About most things.</i>

Idiot.

<i>But people change.</i>

<i>Or they don't change.</i>

<i>Things happen. People drift apart.</i>

<i>They build walls. They take offence.</i>

<i>Who knows why.</i>

<i>Maybe it was all the construction
that drove everybody crazy.</i>

<i>You know, there used to be
a forest up on that hill.</i>

<i>That's why they call it Birchwood.</i>

<i>Then they started building
all those condos</i>

<i>and cut down all the birches.</i>

They didn't even realise
what they were doing until we told them,

Reuben and I.

But this was before the coup?

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Reuben and I were friends then.

After that,
all we saw were the differences.

[quirky tense music playing]

A few years later, their son, Chris,
he, uh, took a job in Japan,

and I don't think
he's been back to visit them since.

-Oh.
-Reuben and he never did get along.

<i>Anyway, that's when I decided
to bury the hatchet.</i>

Reuben.

Hey.

Sonya gave me this a while back.

Never found the occasion.

I thought maybe we could start fresh.

[quirky tense music continues]

Hey, would you like to see my new car?

Sure.

It's a new model.

Just came out.

VoilÃ .

A Toyota?

You bought a Toyota.

Celica GT convertible.

Five-speed automatic.

You gotta change with the times.

Otto!

I don't know what went wrong with Reuben,
but that's when I knew I'd lost him.

I mean, a man has to stand up
for what he believes in.

Even if it is an F-O-R-D.

[Marisol chuckles]

And you and Sonya,
did you ever think about having children?

Well, 2:00.

Okay.

Yes.

I was wondering
if you could help us out tonight.

Me and Tommy don't get a lot of time
to go out for dinner

before the baby comes.

I'm not gonna drive you two
around on a date.

No. We're gonna take a cab.

What do you need me for, then?

-Mama, I did not! Why would I?
-Yes, you did!

-Give it back!
-You gotta catch me!

You guys, <i>por favor</i>.

-[Marisol yelling in Spanish]
-[door slams]

[in English]
And learn to share your everything.

[speaks in Spanish]

I'm not sure about this.

[in English] No. Don't be silly.
It's gonna be very fun.

If you remember,
Abbie has to be in bed by 9:00, okay?

-You're good?
-[grunts]

So, alarm code, 4491. 4491.

I'm setting it to "Armed Stay."
Are you paying attention?

So if you wanna go out,

you just have to press this button here,
and it's disalarmed.

I'll be right here.

Right. Yeah.

Well, you never know.

Be good to <i>Abuelo </i>Otto please, okay?


I don't see chocolate milk in here.

You make it with the syrup.
But not too much. It'll keep her awake.


What is that?

That's the goddamn useless dishwasher.

Dad said he wanted
to throw it out the window,

but Mom said Dad isn't allowed
to open windows anymore.


<i>Cabeza</i>.

<i>-Cabeza.
-Cabeza.</i>

Good.

Eyes.

<i>Ojos</i>.

<i>-Ojos.
</i>-<i>Ojos.</i>

Why?

Because no one stands a chance
against a <i>luchadoro</i>.

<i>Abuelo Luchadoro!</i>

<i>Abuelo Luchadoro!</i>

Help me, help me.

Wait, no, he started it.

-Ready?
-Rub it and smack!

Rub it and smack! Smack! Karate chop!

[gentle pensive music playing]

[Abbie & Luna speaking indistinctly]


[both whispering in Spanish]

[in English] Wow, it's awfully quiet, huh?

[whispers in Spanish]

[Marisol speaks in Spanish]

-[Luna speaks in Spanish]
-Hey, guys.

[Marisol in English] Hi.

Hi.

She was already asleep.

[speaks in Spanish]

[in English] How was it?

-Fine.
-You did a good job tonight, Otto.

You should pat yourself on the back.

-[Tommy] Thank you, Otto.
-[Otto] Yeah.

[automated voice] <i>Exit now.</i>


Okay.

How did he do that?

-[gentle music playing]
-[rattling]

-[Malcolm] Hi, Otto.
-Malcolm.

You can't hear your chain rattle
when you switch gears like that?

-My bike's getting old.
-Don't blame the bike.

You just have to adjust your derailleur.

-My what?
-Your derailleur needs adjusting.

Uh, excuse me.

-Hi, I'm Shari Kenzie.
-Hi.

I'm a social media journalist.

I'm, um, looking for Otto Anderson.

Are you sure you wanna do that?

Wow. It's great. That's amazing.

You treat it right, it'll treat you right.

Here. Keep the set.

Thanks, Otto.

I can't believe I'm helping you
throw crap onto people's lawns.

Isn't two jobs enough?

I'm saving up for a car.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

What kind?

Volkswagen.


[engine turns off]

Young lady, you're blocking the garage.

Mr Anderson? My name is Shari Kenzie.

I'm a social media journalist, and I--

What is that?

I have an online series
called <i>Everyday Heroes</i>.

What you did the other day
at the train station was amazing.

You saved that man's life.

You have the wrong guy.

No, I don't. I've watched the video
at least a dozen times.

-It's you.
-Video?

You haven't seen it?

Oh. A commuter recorded what happened
on their phone and posted it online.

Someone in the comments recognised you.
That's how I tracked you down.

It's gotten over a million views.

A million? A million.

Why can't people mind their own business?

Because stories like yours are inspiring.

If I could just talk to you
for a few minutes--

No, now I've got too many things
I have to do.

I recorded a video message
from the man you saved.

You should see this.

-Um... just pull it up.
-[Marisol] Otto! Hi!

Good morning.

Good morning.


-So you ready for another driving lesson?
-[pounding on garage door]

-Now's not a good time.
-No?

Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm still in here!

-I didn't lock you in.
-[Shari] Hello?

Turn the knob, open the door.

-[speaks in Spanish]
-Opened a door before, haven't you?

Idiot.

[Marisol in English] Otto! It's me.

She's gone.

Good. I'm not through with my rounds.

"Social media journalist"?

What the hell does that even mean?

Buncha knotheads pointin'
a camera at themselves.

I thought you handled it really well.

I mean, closing her in your garage.

That was, like, excellent strategy.

-[growls]
-Good job. [laughs]

Otto, also, I was thinking
you've done so much for us.

-I wanna do something for you too.
-I don't need anything.

Well, I think you could do
with some decent food. Sometimes. No?

Those cookies...

The what? The <i>"salporanz"?</i>

Those are not bad. They're not bad.

And, also, I was thinking

that I can help you clean out your house
and clean out the front hall in your home,

and help you pack the coats and shoes
you have there of Sonya's.

That's not needed.

No, but it can help you move on.

I don't wanna move on.

She's always gonna be with you.

-But you're still here.
-Ah...

That's enough.

When my father died,
my mother, she stopped living.

-She just stopped like she used--
-Stop talking!

-Stop it.
-Okay! Don't yell at me.

Why can't people mind
their own business? Idiots.

Interrupting me at every turn.

The more they babble, the more
they drown out the memory of her voice.

I don't want to clear Sonya from my life.

She was everything.

There was nothing before her,
and there's nothing after!

I'm something.

-[car approaching]
-[hip-hop music blaring from speakers]

That son of a bitch!

Uh-uh. No, no, no.

Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh.

Stop right there. You stop that car!

Did you leave that gate open?
You left that gate open, didn't you?

You're the only one who gives a damn.

I give a damn
about people following the rules.

Yes, I know. I know all about you.

There's a file on you at the office.
It's this thick.

I know about your wife.

How you blame whatever happened to her
on everybody else.

You shut up.

Don't you say one more word. [gasping]

Take it easy, Otto.
Look, I'm not trying to upset you,

but you really shouldn't be living alone.

I mean, we know more about you
than you probably realise, so...

Just look after that heart of yours, okay?

What do you know about my heart?

Hey, what do you know about my heart?!

You prying bastard!

Otto, Otto.

Otto, what's going on?
Are you okay? Do you feel okay?

You wanna help me, close the gate.

[tense music playing]

[lock clicks]


-[knocking on door]
-Otto.

Otto.

Talk to me, Otto. Please?

[tense music distorting]

Otto.

[speaks in Spanish]

[in English] Talk to me, Otto.

Otto.

[knocking on window]

Otto.

[distorted tense music continues]

Thank you.

[music turns poignant]


-[young Otto]<i> No.
</i>-[Sonya] <i>Aw, c'mon.</i>

Honey, you look really cute. [laughs]

[poignant music continues]


[beeping and screeching]

playing over radio]



Give me your hand.

Sonya!

<i>â™ª I should be crying
But I just can't let it show â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I should be hoping
But I can't stop thinking â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Of all the things I should've said

<i>â™ª All the things we should've done â™ª</i>

Sonya!

<i>â™ª That we never did â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, darling â™ª</i>


<i>â™ª Make it go â™ª</i>

[song ends]

[poignant music playing]

You're angry. I know.

And sad.

So am I.

But now we have to live.

-[knocking on door]
-[gunshot]

-[music ends]
-[dogs barking]



What now?

Malcolm.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

I'm not gonna shoot you.

What was that noise?

The generator blew and the power is out.

What d'ya want? It's freezing.

I was hoping you might let me crash
on your couch for the night.

This is not a hotel.

No. I'm sorry.

Why can't you go home?

My dad kicked me out.

There's a sofa you can use.

Don't go into the dining room.
The ceiling needs repair.

It's upstairs in Sonya's old study.

So why did he kick you out?

Because you're Malcolm now?

Yeah, because I'm Malcolm.

Because I dress like this.

I read too much.
I don't like sports. Take your pick.

He's embarrassed 'cause I'm trans.

Then he's an idiot.

[tender music playing]

This is you.

Try not to touch anything.

Okay.


[dishes clattering]

Well...

Good morning. The power's still out

so I cooked up the last of the eggs
while they're still good.

Hope you don't mind.

I have to do my rounds.

Don't you at least want some coffee first?

Yes.

There you go.

Uh, some eggs?

I wouldn't say no.

All right.

[upbeat music playing]

That can...

goes in here.

Hang that up.

Hey, Otto! Making your rounds.

You mind if I join you?
I need to get my steps in.

-[Otto sighs]
-Okay.

-I'm Jimmy.
-Malcolm.

-Nice to meet you.
-Aw, thanks.


Yes.

Hey, Otto, if you want to slow down,
we can 'cause my beats are up.


Otto, did you hear they're moving Reuben
into assisted living this afternoon?

Who is?

The Dye & Merika guys.

-My God.
-[music fades]

They convinced Anita to sell the house.

No, they made the deal with Chris.

-Chris? He can't do that.
-Yeah, he can.

After Dye & Merika found out
Anita had Parkinson's,

they tracked Chris down and--

-Parkinson's?
-Yeah.

So last year Chris convinced Anita
to give him power of attorney

in case she got worse.

So Dye & Merika made the deal
with Chris to buy the house.

Those pricks.

Wait, Anita found out
she had Parkinson's last year?

No, that's not right.

She would've told Sonya.
Sonya would've told me.

Well, Anita and Reuben
didn't want you and Sonya to know.

They said you had enough
on your plate as it is.

They said that?

[lively pensive music playing]

I need to see everything
you ever got from Dye & Merika.

Notices, letters. Do you have
a copy of the power of attorney?

How do you know about that?

-Do you have it?
-Yes.

-Get it.
-Yes.

And any records
of Reuben's condition and yours.

Did Jimmy tell you that?

Can you get it now?

Yes.

I've been an idiot.

I got so wrapped up in my own troubles,
I stopped thinking of anyone else.

And I figured
they weren't thinking about me.

[inhales deeply]

Friends shouldn't do that.

So...

This isn't easy to say
after all this time.

But I'm sorry.

And I will sort all this out.

[lively pensive music continues]

I need to use your phone.

Why can't you use your own?

Mine is disconnected at the moment.

-Why?
-That doesn't matter.

I just need to use your phone, okay?

You know what?

No.

-No?
-No.

You won't tell me
why your phone is disconnected?

You won't tell me
why you need to use my phone?

You won't tell me what happened
to you in the street yesterday?

And then you went inside
and you wouldn't even open the door?

You scared me, Otto.

Do you know how long I was out there?

And I didn't know
if something had happened to you.

Or if something was gonna happen to you.

And I'm sorry if I said
the wrong thing about Sonya's coats.

But I was just trying to help.

And you left me out there.

So, no. You can't use my phone.

You think your life is so hard
because everybody's an idiot

and you have to do everything
on your own, right?

Right?

But guess what.

You can't.

No one can.

And I think you should just be happy

that someone was trying
to help you get through a crappy day.

Even if they're an idiot.

-So...
-The real estate bastards

are trying to force
Anita and Reuben out of their home.

That's why I need to use your phone.

Okay, fine. Come on.

We had never had a vacation.

[poignant music playing]

Sonya was six months pregnant.

And she wanted to do something special
before the baby came.

So we booked a trip to Niagara Falls.

On the way back, the bus crashed.

There'd been a recall on the brake lines,

but the company never had them fixed.

Sonya was paralyzed...

and we lost our son.

<i>After three months,
she was finally able to come home.</i>

<i>But they had started building
the new condos</i>

<i>and the community centre
and the walkways,</i>

<i>none of which were designed
for people in wheelchairs.</i>

The builders could have
changed their plans.

But the laws weren't in place back then,
and they didn't care.

<i>I did.</i>

-We're putting in a new playground...
-<i>I cared.</i>

<i>-There's places for people like your wife.
</i>-And I was so angry.

What does that mean?
People like her? What does that mean?

-What're you tryin' to say?!
-[yells]<i> Get off of me!</i>

That's when they voted me out
as head of the homeowners' association.

I wanted to obliterate them all.

The builders, and the realtors,
and the bus company, the bus driver.

I never would have let it go...

but for Sonya.

Sonya said we had to keep living.

That's what I did.

I lived for Sonya.

Six months ago she passed away.

<i>Cancer.</i>


I was going to join her.

That's why I had them disconnect my phone.

But now I think
she wants me to keep living.

And I have things to do.

{\an8}[beeping]

[hip-hop music blaring over speakers]

[engine turns off]

You're wasting your time, Otto.

It's a done deal. Reuben's coming with us.

And if you get in our way,

I'll have you arrested.

-I'm not doing a thing.
-Don't you take another step.

You are not taking my husband
away from me.

Anita, please.
We're doing this for your own good.

What you're doing
is trying to take my property.

{\an8}I want Reuben to stay right here
for the rest of his life,

with me in our home.

Okay, but who's gonna take care of Reuben
when you're no longer able to?

Who's gonna take care of you? Otto?

Otto's not in the best health either.
Are you, Otto?


-What are you doing? Put that down.
-Anita and Reuben are like family to me.

I'll take care of them
as long as they need.

They're not your family.

Uh, their son, Chris, has decided
they're not fit enough to be on their own,

and so what we're doing is--

Excuse me. When was the last time
Chris saw his parents?

He lives in Japan.
They've been estranged for 10 years.

Chris would have no idea
how his parents are doing,

except for what you told him.

Okay. And who are you?

My name is Shari Kenzie.

Social media journalist.

-We're streaming live right now.
-Uh...

{\an8}All right, all right,
shut that camera off. You can't film this.

It's a public sidewalk.

You told Anita's son, Chris,
that she had Parkinson's,

{\an8}but Anita never told anyone
about her diagnosis.

{\an8}So how did you know?

I'd have to check the records.

Mr Anderson over there
is something of a local hero.

{\an8}He tells me you know details
about his private health records as well.

So how are you and your company

getting illegal access
to the medical records of seniors?

[uplifting music playing]

{\an8}Okay, let's go. We're done. We're done.


No, you're done. You're done!

-Get that goddamn camera out of my face.
-[Tommy] Goodbye.

-We did it!
-Oh, we did!


{\an8}I first uploaded Anita and Chris's story
an hour ago.

{\an8}Already dozens of people are saying

{\an8}Dye & Merika forced them
out of their homes.

-[Otto] That was easy.
-Yeah, goodbye.

share it with me at Shari_Kenzie.

-I got it. I got it.
-[Otto laughing]


He just rolled right over. Gave up.

In our day, the bastards would
at least put up a fight.

They haven't gotten rid of us yet.

[poignant music playing]

Yeah.

It does feel pretty good. Doesn't it?

a thing of the past?

Well, I'm here with eyewitnesses
Anita and Jimmy to find out more.

Jimmy, you mentioned that Anita
and Reuben are like family to you.

What does that mean, exactly?

Well, I have dinner at their house
nearly every single night.

[speaking indistinctly]

I know what you're waiting for.
You're ready for lunch, aren't you?

I know what you want.

Whoa. Here we go.

You moved into this community recently.

{\an8}-How has that been for you?
-It's been beautiful.

{\an8}[Shari] And your family,
to have people there that are--

{\an8}Yeah.

{\an8}-Otto?
-Will you air this in Mexico?

Otto!


[poignant music continues]

-Ms Mendes? You can see him now.
-Yes?

Yes. Yeah.

<i>Hola, Abuelo </i>Otto.

[medical devices beeping]

[speaking in Spanish]

Ms Mendes?

I'm Dr Ellis.

Mr Anderson listed you as next of kin.

Yes. Yes, that's correct.

Your uncle had a close call.
Has he spoken to you about his condition?


No, not really. No.

It's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Basically, his heart is too big.

Too big?


Oh, okay.

Oh.

[laughs, then speaks in Spanish]

[in English] No, sorry. It's okay.

-[Otto groans]
-[Marisol laughing]

You're really bad at dying, you know that?

[Marisol continues laughing]

Ay. [speaks in Spanish]

[in English] Otto, I think it's time.

I think it's time.

It's time.

Oh, uh, I'm a cardiologist.
I'll page OB for you.

[lively music playing]

Do something. It's time!

[speaking in Spanish]


All right, picture, everybody!

Picture, picture, picture.

All right. Ready? Everybody say, "Marco."

One, two, three.

Marco!

Otto!

<i>-Hola.</i> Hi!
-[Tommy] Hey, Otto. Come in.

Everyone, this is our friend Otto.

Hi, Otto!

Hey, Otto.

Sorry, is this about the cars
that are in front?

No, I brought you something.

[Marisol gasps]

Otto.

Otto.

I gave it a fresh coat of paint.

I love it.

-It's for the baby.
-Yes.

Thank you.
Okay, hold him one second, please.

-Why?
-To show Tommy.

Hold him. Oh, he's gonna cry.

-[speaking in Spanish]
-Whoa...

[in English]
I'll be right back, <i>bebÃ©. </i>Okay.

Tomaso?

Hello. There we are.

-[fussing]
-Uh, should I put this thing back in him?

There.

Oh. Yeah.

Okay.

<i>Yo soy Abuelo </i>Otto.

Okay?

Uh, well, let me show you how this works.

[tender music playing]

You don't have to do anything.

Easy.

Your little head...

Now, you just go...

like so.

Huh?

[heart thumping]


They have something for you.

-Hi, Sonya.
-Hi, Sonya.

-That's, uh, brand-new little Marco there.
-[speaks in Spanish]

And Marisol, Tommy. I told you about them.

Say, <i>"Hola</i>. Hola, Sonya."

She loved pink flowers, girls.

You chose well.

I like pink too.

[tender music continues]

You see that?

[cat purring]

[tender music playing]

-[Tommy] Ready?
-[Marisol] Yes.

Okay.

[heart thumping]


[thumping subsides]

No.

No, no, no.

Come on, Otto.

All right, Malcolm,
check that oil. Check it.

And let's see, what does it say?

Looks good, right?

-If you say so.
-Okay.

That's it. Okay, now...

Here's your manual.

Here's your papers.

And the key.

It's your car.

Are you kidding me?

Nope.

What?

Otto!

Thank you. Oh, thank you.

-Oh, my gosh.
-Saved you from a Volkswagen.

I have a car! I have a car!

-[Jimmy] <i>This is your car!
</i>-[Malcolm]<i> Are you kidding me?</i>

[horn honking]

[Marisol speaking in Spanish]

Otto? You got your truck!

Oh, my God!

Wanna go for a ride?

-Let's go for a ride?
-That's a nice truck, Otto.


I like your car, Otto.

Yeah? Wait till you see how it rides.

[speaks in Spanish]

[in English] It's enormous.

Jimmy, would you like to say
