Oh great, mighty Rapu.

We pray to you.

For water and sustenance.

I pray to you, not for me...

But for my daughter.

I'm tired.

You have suffered...

Come to me...

You have suffered...

Ah, what do we have here?

Look at it...

Gobbling up all my fruit.

Rapu.

Bringer of light.

Oh, it's one of mine.

I am Gorr.

The last of your disciples.

We have lost everything, my lord.

The land is dry.

All life is lost.

But our faith in you,
never wavered.

And now we await the promise...

of the eternal reward.

Is this why you celebrate?

He thinks there's
an eternal reward.

No...
No, sorry.

There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

We just vanquished
the holder of the Necrosword.

Before he could harm any other
gods with that cursed blade.

You see...
Threaten to end my entire empire.

But my lord...

Your empire has already ended.

There's no one left to worship you.

There'll be more followers to replace you.

There always are.

We have suffered...

And we have starved.

My daughter died...

in your name.

And well, you should.

Suffering for your gods
is your only purpose.

There's nothing for you after death...

...except death!

You are no god.

I renounce you.

Now, your meaningless life...

...finally does have a purpose.

To sacrifice yourself to me.

So it's revenge you seek...

Kill all the gods.

Go to Eternity.

It's revenge you seek.

Summon...
The Bifrost...

Go to Eternity...

Summon...
The Bifrost...

Go to Eternity.

Kill all the gods.

The sword chose you...

But you are now cursed.

Funny...

It doesn't feel like a curse.

Feels like a promise.

So this is my vow...

All gods will die.

Come...

Come, gather round...

And listen to the legend
of the Space Viking.

a.k.a. "The God of Thunder".

a.k.a. "Thor Odinson".

Raised in the way of the Warrior...

Thor was taught to
help bring balance.

Fighting the good fight, for
those who can't fight neither.

He grew.

And he grew.

And he grew.

He was sensitive,
like a smile.

And his loving nature
did not discriminate.

He once loved a swash-buckling fashionista.

Another time, he
loved a wolf woman...

on a woman wolf.

But Thor's one true love was an
Earth woman named Jane Fonda.

Oh, wait no...

Jane Foster.

But sadly...

In the battle for love, Thor lost.

In fact,
he lost a lot of people in those days.

His mum.

His dad.

And that guy.

And that guy...

And whoever that is.

And Heimdall.

And his brother.

And his brother again.

And again.

Poor Thor had to watch
his planet explode.

And then he said,
"What have I done?"

it seemed that everything
and everyone he loved, he lost.

And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod...

So it could never be broken again.

But just because he was done loving,
didn't mean he was done fighting.

He teamed up with
the Guardians of the Galaxy...

and set off on some
classic Thor adventures.

He got in shape...

Putting in the hard yards...

Turning pains into gains...

And never skipping leg day.

He went from dad bod to god bod

But beneath this god bod...

There was still still a sad bod,
just trying to get out.

Because all of the bods that
Thor had worn over the years...

Couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.

So, he gave up his search for nothing.

Accepting that he was
only good for one thing.

Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say...

Thor...

We need your help
to win this battle.

Thor...

We need your help
to win this battle.

Let's go.

Alright, I'm game.

Come on, Stormbreaker.

Let's hurry, okay?

People are dying.

See you down there.

Hurry up!

Gimme those!

You're gonna break it.

I am Groot!
Oh, you got sap all over it.

Hello, everybody!

Well, well...
Look who it is!

How are we doing, guys?
Horrible!

We're all about to die!

You said, this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

I said, it was going to
be like a relaxing holiday.

Well, look at that resplendent skyscape.
Three suns of Saturn.

What can be more
relaxing than that?

An actual holiday!

Die, Booskan scum!

God of Thunder!
King Yakan.

You have finally joined our fight.

Well, as they say,
better late than not at all.

It's very nice.

As you know, we
used to live in peaceful oasis.

But then, our gods were murdered.
Murdered?

And now, our sacred temple
has been left unguarded...

And Habooska's horde
took control of it's path.

It is our most sacred
shrine and... He desecrates.

Not for long.

King Yakan...

Tell them what happened here today.

Tell the time that Thor...

Ragtag, motley crew,
misfit desperados...

Turn the tide in the battle and
etch their names in history.

The odds may be against us...

But I'll tell you this for free.
Here we go.

This ends here, and now!

Please don't let him
go into the temple.

Well done, everybody.

We can collectively take credit for that,
because we worked as a team.

We used our hearts and
our minds to defeat the enemy...

With minimal loss or damages.

What a classic Thor adventure.

Hurrah!

Good book?

Yeah.

I wrote it.

You're...
You're Dr. Jane Foster?

I am.

Hi!
Hi!

How's the Einstein-Rosen bridge?

Tough.

Yeah.
Really tough.

You need a 3D model.

You ever seen Event Horizon?

No.

Interstellar?
No.

That movie explains
everything really clearly.

Um, alright.

The Einstein-Rosen
bridge folds space...

So that point A and point B
will coexist in space, like that.

You just ruined your own book.

Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

You watch those movies.
Okay.

Ah, the hot Cheetos.
Had to get it.

So how's the...
How's the club?

It's going amazing.

Have you...

Told anyone else besides me?

When people find out.
they start acting weird.

They're just...

different.

And I'm not afraid now.

Anyway, it's not that serious.

Jane, it's stage four.

Out of like, how many stages?

Four.
That we know about.

Oh, you have uh...

Somewhere else you gotta be right now,
that's more important than chemo.

No...

You're trying to get back
to the lab, aren't you?

I have a few ideas I'm trying.
Okay, no. Time out.

I know you think your lab work
is something you have to do.

Otherwise, you're letting
down all civilization, but...

You're not getting what the universe
is actually trying to tell you...

So let me translate.

Slow.
Down.

Use your energy to fight this thing.

I'll fight it my way, okay?

Um, FYI...

"My way" does not have
to equal alone in a lab.

Maybe it's time to play
the Space Viking card.

It's not a card.
Yes, it is.

There's no card.
There's a card.

It's tall, and blonde,
and it's gorgeous.

It is a handsome card.

Jane, are you sure?

I will figure this out...

By myself.

Results are just
coming back the same.

I'm afraid the chemo
has very little effect.

I'm so sorry, Jane.

If there's anything I can do
or if you just wanna talk, call me.

Smell like a king...

Because you're worthy.

Old Spice.

Look at this place.
It's beautiful, oh.

Allfather.

We're here to take you home.
Yes.

To Planet Asgard.

Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

It is a people.
It is you.

And now it is time for me
to pass on to the spirit realm.

I will take my place

in the great banqueting hall of Valhalla,
the resting place of the gods.

Oh, one more thing.

You have a sister.

And so now I turn into godly
stardust and say farewell.

Oh, look.

Do you see?

Dad?

I'm disappearing.

No!
Father!

But wait, brother!

An ominous portal has appeared behind us.

Transform!

I am Hela,
Goddess of Death.

Now, I return to Asgard, to stake my
claim as the rightful heir to the throne.

And no one will stop me!

Join me or die.

We'll never join you, witch.
MjÃ¶lnir.

Impossible!

I broke your hammer!

Time to die!

Bifrost!
Bifrost!

You can almost feel the power

of these magnificent and immovable stones.

Okay, let's head back to the village...

where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

Come on.

God of Disaster...

We thank you.

We feared we would be at war forever
without the protection of our gods.

But now, peace shall reign.

In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

It is tradition, protectors of our
world are bestowed with great... beasts...

Giant goats?
Oh, look at those. They are wonderful.

Korg, look at that.
Those kids are beautiful.

King Yakan,
thank you so much.

Listen um...
about the temple.

I don't want to talk about the temple.
I know, but if we were to talk about it.

It's important... Okay, I'll stop talking.
It's making me sad and mad.

Don't forget the goats.

Which you accepted and now must take with you.

No whacking.

Awh, they are beautiful.

Yes, they are beautiful.

They also scream quite a lot.
They'll be fine.

We need to find a damn remote so
we can download the distress signal.

Well, re-retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

One of these goats
probably ate it.

Goats don't eat remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

Alright, he can do that crap.

I love them.

These will live with us forever.

Found the remote!

I'm putting them down.

Don't shoot.

No, it's not working.
It's not charged.

Well maybe, you need
to find the charger.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

Korg, you okay?
Yeah, bro. All good.

Alright.
Everybody, just relax.

The goats are going
to be fine.

If not, we can just
turn them to meat.

...ting people... meeting people.
They are great conversation starters.

And... been told you can summon them
with a special whistle.

It goes something like this...

No, that's not it.

No, that's not it.

No, that's not it.
You have a go.

No, that's not it.

Oh! Hey, guys!
Kraglin!

You've been here,
this whole time?

Yeah, you said to
stay with the ship.

This is Glenda.
We're married.

I am Groot.

What did I tell you about
jumping into new relationships?

That I shouldn't do that.
Yeah!

You can't get married on
every single planet we land on.

I am Groot.

Finally!

Alright, here we go.
"Distress Calls".

Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!

God Butcher?

It's just a dragon.
It's a warning!

All of these gods murdered.

Our greatest champions...

Now laid to waste.

The horror.

Who could have done something like this?

Where are you?
Wait, wait, wait.

What was that?
Go, go, go back.

Play that one.

Thor, where are you?

Sif.
We need you here.

Well, my friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

Start the ship, my friends.

Oh. Maybe,
we should split up.

So many people to save, I mean.

Look at all these distress... calls.

Thor, you're gonna be okay?

I admire your commitment to each other.
It's a beautiful thing.

Alas, it's something
I'll never have.

Buddy, if I may

You may.

After thousands of years of living, you
don't seem to know who the hell you are.

I've been lost before.

Then I found meaning,
I found love.

And yeah, it got taken
from me, and God, that hurts.

But that shitty feeling is
better than feeling empty.

My hope for you is that one day,
you will find something...

To make you feel this shitty.

I have loved before.

Didn't work out.

They either die a brutal death or
they dump you with the handwritten letter.

I don't know which is worse, which is
why I keep everyone at arm's length.

I've grown too attached, damn it!
I knew this would happen.

You must go!

I'll find, Sif.

You answer the other calls.

The Galaxy needs its guardians.

Cool, yeah. We were just thinking.
Shhh! I know this hurts.

But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

To ease the pain,
why don't you uh...

Take the ship here,
as a parting farewell gift.

Oh, you're giving me my ship?

Yes, she's yours.

May you make as many
memories with her as I have.

She's a temperamental old lass.

Serve you well,
in a tight pickle.

Start the ship?
Thank you.

Goodbye, old friend.

Human handshake.

Asgardian shake.

Into the snake that
you cannot trust.

Really dragging this out
Finish the classic Asgardian high one.

Let's go.
Take care of my crew.

It's going to be
hard for them.

Hurry up!
Not her.

Remember what I told you.

You ever feel loss?

Just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

They'll tell you exactly where you are.

Alright, bye.

Once more, but we
had good memories.

We Asgardians say, "May you travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens".

I'll see you in Valhalla
where we shall drink mead.

They're gone.

Alone again, just me and you.

Stormbreaker!

Careful with your crazy ax.

So what do we do now, bro?

Let's go get Sif.

Who or what is that?

Falligar,
God of the Falligarians.

One of the nicest
gods you'll ever meet.

Sif!
It's me, Thor.

Odinson.

You're missing an arm.

Let me get you home.

No!

Leave me here.

I want to die a warrior's death.

On the battlefield, in battle.

And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

Oh, I hate to break it to you.

But for a warrior
to get into Valhalla,

you have to die in the battle.

You survived.
Ah, shit!

Maybe, your arm is in Valhalla.

What happened here?

I've been hunting a mad man.

I followed him here!

It was a trap.
Who is this mad man?

The God Butcher,
he's coming.

He seeks the extinction of the gods.

Asgard is next.

Look, it's Thor! Thor!
Take Sif to the infirmary.

Hey! Who'd you piss off now?

It's not my fault.

I've never even seen these things,
whoever the hell they are.

Welcome back.

Die!

Whos' the new guy?

That guy...
You're gonna love that guy.

MjÃ¶lnir.

MjÃ¶lnir!

It's me, Thor.

Have you seen my hammer?

MjÃ¶lnir, here boy.

MjÃ¶lnir?

MjÃ¶lnir.

You're back.

MjÃ¶lnir!

'Scuse me.
Hello.

That's my hammer you got in there.

and that's my look.

Hey!

Enough tomfoolery, wench.

Take off that mask
and reveal yourself.

Grant...

Hey.

Jane?!

Let me tell you the
legend of Thor and Jane.

He was a God of Thunder.

And she, a woman of science.

And although they were
from different worlds...

Somehow, it just made sense.

And together, they embarked
on the journey of love.

Thor taught Jane,
the way of the warrior.

And Jane taught Thor,
the way of the people.

And as time passed, their
love grew deeper and deeper.

She's incredible.
Isn't she, MjÃ¶lnir?

I need you to promise me,
you'll always protect her.

I love you too, buddy.

A love that deep, has a way
of becoming magical.

Thor set a path towards a future
and all it might hold.

But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.

And although Jane didn't want to admit it,

she was scared of loss as well.

And so, they built walls between them.

Thor got busy,
saving humanity.

Heimdall!

Jane got busy, doing the same.

Real busy.

And eventually, the space
between them grew and grew

Until it became too wide to bear.

Some things
had to give.

I have to stay up all night,
then go through this data.

While I just stay up all night
eating and clean all of this up.

There's two plates!

And then one night,
it didn't give.

Jane wrote a note.

And Thor read that note.

And their legend
suddenly became myth.

Or so they thought.

You okay?

Yes.

It's a little hot,
isn't it?

Just trying to feel...

Bit claustrophobic
with the helmet.

How?!

Can we talk about this later?

Yeah, sure.

Great seeing you!

What?!

Hey! Is that the Necrosword?

That's cool. I've only ever
read about it in stories.

Then, you know
this is going to hurt.

Pain.

What is pain, but a construct
invented by the weak.

Oh, okay!
That's very sharp!

Ready?

Don't touch my things.

You better run,
you coward.

The children!
They're taking the children!

Mommy!
Mommy!

Dad!
Mom!

Mother!

Shadow monsters,
disgusting.

Flew around the world twice, nothing.

Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.

Quite a reunion, huh?
Ah, you're telling me.

What's it been like?
Three, four years?

Eight years, seven months and six days.

I haven't forgotten.

The last time I saw you or
didn't see you, because you left.

Kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.

Ah, no, you left.
You did.

You wrote me
a beautiful handwritten letter.

I should know,
I was there.

You weren't there, actually.
I was.

Hence, the note...

And if you weren't there to see me
leave, then maybe it was you that left.

Fair point.

Not that it matters, like...
No.

Just keeping track, right?
Yeah.

I supposed we both left
and both got left.

Now, you're leaving again.

Miek, we need detailed
accounts from all the witnesses.

Darryl, get all the names of the
children who've been lost.

Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken.
Don't worry.

And she'll be found.

Guys, they're bleeding!
Get them to the infirmary, now!

Darryl!
Majesty.

Should we start working on a
performance of this entire debacle?

People need entertainment.

Particularly now,
in times of crisis.

Particularly.

I did not hear a "no".

Nor did I.

Asgard, at night.

We open on some
sleeping children.

So that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

The old ex-girlfriend,
Judie Foster.

Jane Foster.
The one that got away.

The one that got away.

That means escaped.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend

and your ex-hammer hanging out 
and getting on so well.

What you up to, bro?

Come on.

Come to daddy.

Come on, MjÃ¶lnir.

Hey, there you are!

Hey!

I was just calling you.
...Start an army.

With what?

Half our soldiers are dead.
Half our soldiers are always dead.

Everyone, please. Go home.
Where are the children?

I promise you will have news soon.

I don't know.
Can't go far.

I think the worst has happened.

She'll find them.

You know what?
This is all wrong.

Asgard!

My friends,
we must not quarrel.

Times like this, we need
to unite and come together.

See what's happening here.

We're afraid.

Hm?

Scared.

Afraid.

Anxious.

If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.

I'm sorry, Miek.

It's very hard to give a rousing
speech with the eh-eh-eh noise.

What are you doing?

She's taking minutes.
Well, precious minutes we don't have.

Want the kids back?

I'll be back in a moment.

Write that down, Miek.

Stormbreaker,
what are you doing?

Is this about MjÃ¶lnir?

Everyone out!

Didn't find 'em.

Your cape is on fire.

It's fine,
it'll grow back.

I'm invoicing you for this.

Okay.

What do we know about this guy?

He travels through shadows.

And he creates
monsters with them.

Absolutely, freaky monsters.

Also wields the Necrosword.

How do I know that?

Because he almost speared
me in the face with it.

What's a Necrosword?

It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands, since the dawn of time.

It has the ability to slay gods.

It slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...

Oh, so it infected him.
It's infecting him. Yes, it must be.

So basically, we're up against a
cursed shadow, zombie kidnapper.

Awesome!
When do we leave?

Thor?

Can you see me?

Uh, floating head alert.

It's Astrid.

Heimdallson.

Astrid, are you okay?

I no longer go by the name, Astrid.

I'm now known as Axl.

He's a singer from a
popular band I heard on Earth.

GNR.

Astrid...

Your father gave you a very tough Viking
name and I intend to honor his wishes.

Axl.
Astrid.

I said, Axl.
Astrid.

Axl!
He's Asshole! Now, listen to him.

Alright, fine.
"Axl"...

Where are you?
I'm not sure.

I don't know how to
use my magic powers yet.

Your father told me
and I'm here to teach you.

I need you to focus
and hold out your hand.

Okay, good.

Now, focus.
Close your eyes.

Thor!

Hey!
How's it going, kids?

How's it going?
Look where we are.

We're in a cage made of spikes.

Yeah, that's right.
Not good.

You gonna do something?
Yes. Yes, I am.

But just not right now.
I'm the vision ghost, look.

See.
What will happen to us?

You can tell,
this is a very, very bad situation.

You know, the good news
is, you're Asgardian.

So if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

Oh, my God, go away.

Okay, kids.

Alright, kids. Don't cry.
You'll survive, okay?

Listen, I got a plan, okay?

I'm putting together a
really, really good team.

We've got
um, uh...

Uncle Korg.

King Valkyrie.

Um, yeah...

My ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole
'nother story I won't bore you with, okay?

But it is a top notch team, and we're
gonna have you home before you know it.

Yeah.

I know where you are.

I'm gonna get
you out of here.

I'm scared.

We all are.

Look out for them.
Take care. Okay, take care.

See you soon, alright?
I'm gonna get you out of here.

They're in the Shadow Realm.

How do you know?

The atmosphere there has
a darkness like no other.

As if color refused to tread.
It's unmistakable.

Well then,
if it's color we need.

Let's bring the rainbow.

Bring the rainbow? Is that a
catchphrase or something?

She's only been a
Thor for a minute.

I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.
But the rest, she needs work.

How many catchphrases have there been?
A lot.

Yep, jumped the gun.

Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the shadow realm.

It seems like that's where he's
going to be the most powerful.

You're right. We can't
just go launching in there.

Could be a trap.
Could be endangering the children.

We need reinforcements.
We should raise an army.

Are you thinking what I
think you're thinking?

I'm thinking it.
What are we thinking?

Thinking what?
Taking it to...

Omnipotent City
Omnipotent City

What's Omnipotent City?

It's the home of the most
powerful gods of the universe.

We can put together the greatest team ever.

We can recruit Ra,
Hercules, TÅ«matauenga...

QuetzalcÃ³atl, maybe.

And Zeus, the oldest
and wisest of them all.

Did you say, Zeus?
Yes, Zeus.

Like the Zeus.
Zeus Zeus.

I'm not sure if
he has a second name.

You think my god will be there?
Ninny of the Nonny.

Well, you never know, Korg...

But if they are, we'll 
ask them to join our team.

Yes!

Stormbreaker.

Calm down, relax.

No, no, no, mate.

We are not traveling on
Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

Look what just happened.

We can't exactly go in your tiny
little flying portal horse, can we?

We won't all fit.
What are you talking about?

Warsong's awesome.

Stormbreaker's
awesome too.

Stormbreaker just
needs a conduit.

Anything that can
handle space travel.

I love when she talks science.

It has the power
to get us there.

Just need something
to focus that energy

So it's not so...
unpredictable.

You know, uh.

If we had a ship, we could harness it
and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

Ooh, like an engine.

Like an engine.
You need a ship?

I got a ship.

Throw all those seats.

There you go.
No, tie those goats to the front.

We leave in 15 minutes.

Essentials only,
everyone.

That's essential.

Bet you moved on quick, didn't you.

You are some piece of work.

Oh, hey!
Hey.

Catching up with an old friend.
Yeah.

I've been meaning to apologize.

Sort of acting a little weird before.

I just haven't really been myself lately.
You know, now that...

Trying to figure out who I am and
uh, just felt a little bit lost

And then all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me.

And it's been kinda...

It's a lot for me, too.

So how did uh...

you guys get together?

How did this happen?

I swear, I heard
MjÃ¶lnir call to me.

Ah, did it?

And so I came here to investigate and...

Pieces started glowing and swirling...
Crazy.

Thor.

Well, you know what. It looks
good on you. It works, so...

Just checking.

See you later.

What?

We were just talking.

Mommy, don't leave me.

Don't be afraid.

Even when I'm gone, honey.

You won't be alone.

And whatever happens...

Never stop fighting.

Hey.
You alright?

Great!

The sink would say otherwise.

You think I really
should be coming?

I'm not getting any better.

You're a Thor.
Of course, you should come.

Besides, what else
are you gonna do?

You're a Viking now.

Means you pretty much
have to die in battle.

It needs to be
devastatingly painful.

Otherwise, you
don't get into Valhalla.

My plan.

What about you
kinging and stuff?

I love being king.

I love my people.

But it's all meeting
and raven mail.

And meetings that could
have been raven mail.

I miss fighting.

I miss my sisters.

Which is why you need to come
because I need one.

Okay, we should go.
You packed?

Are you packed?

Yes.

A hand grenade?

No, it's a portable speaker.

Let's go.

If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps.

I got you.

My fellow Asgardians...

Wish us well.

For we shall travel with
the speed of Odin's ravens.

We will return with children.

Many children.

Then we should feast,
along the children.

We do not do that anymore.

It was dark times.

Shameful time.

Okay, we should go.

So...
Still rollerblading?

No, no.
You?

Oh yeah, every weekend.

Once you blade, you never fade.

Right, Korg?
Skate twins for life.

Hey, can I run something by you?

Yeah.

So I was thinking,
when we get to the bad guy...

What about if I had, like,
the cool catchphrase, like...

"Eat this hammer, bang!"

Or like?

"Check out my hammer, boom!"

Like, what about?

You know,
I'm workshopping it.

No, they... They're all
really good. Mine is uh...

"This ends here and now."

Oh, that's such a good one.

Took me a long
time to perfect it.

You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

This is my first bad guy.

You never forget your first.

Yeah.

So you got a girlfriend?

Oh, no, no.

Too busy. Don't have time.
You know, just...

With work and everything.

Cool.

Let me check this place out.

So cool.

Who's so cool?
Huh?

The buildings are cool.

What's happening there?

What?
Am I, uh...

Sensing feelings?

Feelings, what?
With Jane?

Yeah.
No, don't be ridiculous with feelings.

The last time we had feelings
were long time ago. Long, long gone.

Not even...
She said you had feelings.

Mate, relax.
We're on the same team.

I know exactly what
team we're on, okay.

Team Jane.

Thing about Thor is that
he always bounces back.

Like when Hela stole his
hammer, he went and built an ax

which is forged in
the heart of a dying star.

And with the same ax,
he used to cut off Thano's head.

Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Now, come on.

What a neat story.

Oh, with all this talk
about chopping off heads...

I wanna have a go.

What's this?

Oh...

Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho...

Oh.

This is Harpy.

Hello, Harpy.

How are you?

Do you know
what Harpy loves?

Having his head ripped off.

What? You liked it
a second ago.

Alright.
Alright, alright.

Harpy's gone.

Come on.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

Ah, you.

I knew a little girl,
just like you.

And she was brave.
And she was smart...

And funny.

And, she liked to draw.

Let me ask you a question...

About gods.

They're meant
to protect you, right?

Well, where are they?

Thor is on his way.
Yeah!

Yes...

I'm counting on that.

That's why you're here.

It's invitation only, so we're gonna
have to keep a low profile and blend in.

Luckily, disguises are my speciality.

Philosopher.

It's all a painting.

What are those?

Actual disguises.

They're the cloaks of
the emotion gods.

Every color signifies
different emotions.

Where are the emotion gods?
Hm, don't ask.

Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

This is where the most powerful
creator gods in the universe hang out.

There's the god of magic.

God of dreams.

God of carpentry.

Ah, look at that one.

Ah, yes.
That's Bao, god of dumplings.

Pst! Hey, Bao.
Bao!

Look up there, guys!

The Kronan god,
Ninny of the Nonny.

Hey, Ninny Nonny.

Zeus!

Hey!

I am Zeus!

Bless us!

Oh, there he is!

The man, the myth, the legend.

Oh, I don't know if you know this,
but I based a lot of what I do on this guy.

He's the god of lightning
and the god of thunder.

Huge source of inspiration.

That's really good.

You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

Um, how do we get up there?

We should like, fly?

Well, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of his entrance.

He's famous for his entrances.

Thunderbolt.

Thunderbolt.
Yes!

Zeus!

Calm down!

Calm down!

Silence.

Silence!

I hereby open...

this holy council of the gods.

Where we have many,
many serious matters...

To be talked about.

Such as...

Where are we going to
hold this year's orgy?

Is this guy for real?

Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

I'm sure he has important things...
Shh!

So now we're going to announce...
Sorry.

The winner of the most human souls
sacrificed in the name of a god.

Yeah, okay.
Maybe, he's not that great.

Oh, no,
not good.

No, I don't think it's going
to get any better than this.

And at least,
god's army can help

But that thunderbolt,
I think that might be huge.

Judges!

Jane, you go right.
Thor, you go left.

We bum-rush him,
take the bolt, ding dong.

All right, let's go get it.
No, no, no, no, no.

There's no ding donging
or bum-rushing.

Especially not, Zeus's bum.

When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

Time is right now.

Time is not right now.
Who is talking?

Who is talking?!

These guys!
Korg, shut up.

You guys have something
to say to the group?

Sorry.

I'm bashing heads in
60 seconds, so speak fast.

Literally, heads will roll.

Who are you two?

Hello!

Uh, let me be the first to say
it is an honor and a privilege...

to be here.
No, I can't hear you.

Why don't you take the stage?

The stage, down there?

Well, yes. You see the area
that looks very much like a stage?

Gotcha.

Oops, sorry.

Good luck, bro!

Mighty Zeus!
Heh, wow!

Gods of the universe.

I come here to ask for help,
to raise an army.

There's a maniac, called the God
Butcher, which seeks to end us all.

His destruction is everywhere.

Entire planets, realms, have
been left completely unprotected.

There's nothing but
chaos in his way.

But I know where he is.

With your help...

We can crush him before
he kills anyone else.

That guy.

He killed a couple
of low-level gods.

Eh, boo-hoo.

If that's all, pretty boy...

You go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

Um, yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not
hear any of what I just said?

He's, he's murdering on mass.

I tell you, one time.

Now, you shut up.

You'll be quiet.

Because you are this close
to being uninvited to the orgy.

Zeus!
We must do something.

You can not come to the orgy!

You have to listen to us.

That's it!
Shut up!

Your highness. Whenever
you're ready, you just tell me.

We go on my signal.

What is the signal?

It'll be go.
Hmm...

Let's see who you are.

Take off your disguise.

And flick!

Flicked too hard, damn it!

Should we help him?

Eventually.

Grape?

Looks like a shy...

And what about the others?

We take off their disguise too.
Oh, no, you don't. We got this.

Disguise off.
Mine's off.

Asgardians...

I thought you've seen the
last of him when Odin died.

You...
are Thor.

The God of Thunder.

It is not thunder,

Just the sound of lightning?

Good one, dad!

Zeus, this is bigger than us.

He's taken Asgardian children.

Who do you think we are?

The God police?

Every god watches
over their own people.

Nothing more,
nothing less.

Asgardian problems...

are Asgardian problems.

How the mighty have fallen.

My hero, Zeus...

Afraid.

Couple of things...

One.
Yes, I am scared.

Gorr has the Necrosword.

Which means, he will kill us.

Not good.

Two, I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

I understand.

But all you do,
is causing panic.

Panic is not good.

We are safe here.

You, my friend.

You are safe here.

So chill up here, okay?

Have some wine. Have some grape.

Anything goes here...

In Omnipotent City.

Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

If you do that,
I put your clothes back on.

Now, I put your clothes back on.

Flick, flick, flick.
It's the Golden Temple of the Gods.

It's not a rude
and nudy festival.

If you're not gonna help us,
then at least, let us use your weapons.

We need your lightning bolt.

My lightning bolt is
called Thunderbolt.

So I think, to use somebody's
secret weapon like this...

That you should, at least, get
the name right when you ask.

Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

Thunderbolt!

No.

Do not worry.

The God Butcher...

He will not reach Eternity.

Eternity?

What does he mean,
"reach Eternity"?

Oh, shit!

Eternity.

It's a very powerful being at
the center of the universe.

He will grant the desire of
the first person who reaches it.

Like a wishing well?

What do you think a guy called,
the God Butcher, would wish for?

If he seeks the altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.

Zeus, we must act now.
He's not going to make it.

He doesn't have the key.

Is this the
purpose of the gods?

To hide away in a
golden palace, like cowards?

Maybe we have lost our way.

You know what?
We're gonna stop him ourselves.

I am afraid,
I cannot allow that.

This is a secret place,

known only to the gods.

You know where we are...

The God Butcher could use you...

To find us.

This is not good.

So now...

You must stay.

Guards!

Hey!

Can we do
my plan now?

Yes,
rush his bum.

Hell, yeah!

Oy,
you didn't say "go".

Coming, guys.

Thor, catch!

Korg!

Val, duck!

Korg!

Thor.

Oh, no.

No!
Korg!

Thor!

I'm perishing.

Zeus!

You're next, Odinson!

That's the sound of lightning.

No.

Korgy!

Thor, I'm down here.

Great! Where are you?

Here I am.
Korgy!

I thought I died.

Yes!
You're alive!

Turns out, the only part of
the Kornan that's alive is its mouth.

Korgy, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

I'll do my best.

My god, I need you alive.
I won't mind.

Ready to go for a ride?

Now,
you got me six.

Eight o'clock, Val.

7:48!

You can do this, dammit.

That's not it.

That's not it.

Nope.

Come on, Korg.
Push those lips.

I did it!

And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us, and we flew out the window.

The end.

Another classic Thor adventure.

Can't believe you killed Zeus.

Well, you know what they say...

Never meet your heroes.

What's important is, we are on
our way to you, right now.

How are you guys doing?
Are you okay?

We're alright.
A little scared.

Well, listen. I know what
it's like to be scared.

And I'll tell you,
when I was your age...

I don't think I would
have been as brave as you.

Really?

In fact, you might just be the
bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

All of you.

So I need you to keep
being brave, alright?

And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

Team kids in a cage.

Can you do that?

Yeah.
I think we can do that.

I know you can.

Alright?

Thor?
Yeah?

I'm glad, I met my hero.

Wow.
Thanks, buddy.

How are the children?

As you can imagine, they're a
little bit scared because they're kids.

But I told him that
everything is going to plan.

And so you lied to them.

You still have a plan?

Yes, there's a plan.
There's no plan.

There is a plan.
No, there's no plan.

We failed to raise a god army.

Korg is dead.
He's not dead.

I'm not dead.
Well, he's a head.

And you, you were properly humilated.

No, I got properly naked,
which I'm okay with.

Jane?
I was okay with it.

Korg?
I loved it.

We're not going into the Shadow Realm
weaker than we were before. We...

We're gonna die.
No one's gonna die.

We...
Okay.

Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

We killed Zeus.
You killed Zeus.

For you, that may or may not
be catastrophic for the whole universe.

And surely,

The entire god kingdom is probably gonna
hunt us down for the rest of our days.

But listen, you stole
this beautiful weapon.

Alright, this is the army right here.

It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful, it's beautiful.

Well, for you, I love it.

For you, Valkyrie.

I mean, it's not
really what I'm into.

But I got my,
my weapon out there.

Can I borrow that for a sec?

Ah!
There you are, old friend.

That was quite
an entrance, back there.

Listen, uh...

We good?

Yeah?

I mean, I don't feel weird having
my ex weapon around, but come on.

MjÃ¶lnir, in the past.

It's you and me now, buddy.

You know what?

I think it's time
for your first beer.

What do you say?

Delicious.

I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

Hey.

Oh, hey.

It's quite the...
view, huh?

Yeah, it's beautiful.

As I was saying, I was very, very
impressed with what you did back there.

You and MjÃ¶lnir.

Yeah.

In space, there are dolphins.
What?

This...

You should see
some space dolphins.

Beautiful.

God.
They're so beautiful, so rare,

They're very loyal creatures.

They mate for life...

In packs of 6.

Just... love.

â™« Oh, brother.
Man, you look so hot â™«

â™« I wanna get in your rocks â™«

â™« When we get together,
we're gonna get it on â™«

â™« I'm gonna make some babies â™«

That is the song that my dad sang to
my other dad when they were courting.

When two Kronans want to make a baby,
they get together inside a mountain.

They go down to
a little lava pool.

They hold hands
over the hot lava.

And then after a month,

They pull their hands apart...

and they finally created a
beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

Oh, it's fascinating.
And hot.

Did you ever had
a special someone?

Oh, I've had...

many special someones.

But, I don't know.

I don't know if I want it again.

Is that because you lost your girlfriend
in battle and never forgave yourself?

And now, you're just trying to find
the answers in the bottom of the bottle.

And some meaningless goings-on,
which only serves to numb the pain.

Instead of bringing you
real happiness or satisfaction.

Yeah, something like that.

They're beautiful.

Beautiful thing.

Jane.

What?
I want to feel shitty about you.

What?

For me, I want...

I...

I want to feel shitty
about something.

I think that's you.

Not really getting attached.
Not as attached.

Well, uh...

My friend, he told me that
it was better to feel shitty

for losing love than it is
to never experience love,

and to feel nothing at all, and
feel empty and I think he was right.

Which is how I've been
feeling for a long time.

I push people away,
kept them at a distance

because of the fear of that loss.

But I don't want to do that anymore.

No, no, no.

Close off your heart
will seal the pain.

That's what I did.

Yes, I closed off my
heart and I meditated.

You meditate?
No, it's so boring.

It actually made
me more angry.

But I'm tired of giving
myself up as the idea of fate

and try to figure out what
the universe wants from me.

I want to live in the moment.

I wanted to live like
there's no tomorrow.

Throw caution to the wind.

I want...
I want to be with you, Jane.

What do you say?

I have cancer.

I'm sorry, what?

I'm dying.

Wait, what is happening?
God!

I...
No, no, no, no.

Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

Wait, Jane.
What did I say?

I didn't mean that.

Just kidding.

I...

don't have cancer.

I want to smash something.

Jane, I'm so sorry.

Don't be sorry.

When did you find out?

Um...

About six months ago.
I...

I was just feeling tired.

And then, they told
me I have stage four.

Get my fears in order.

And then, I heard MjÃ¶lnir
calling me and so...

I thought, maybe...

If science didn't help,
then maybe...

Viking space magic.

And that's why you came to New Asgard.

Yeah, I think the hammer...

Knew what would
be good for me and...

Maybe not.

Jane, none of us know how long we have.

You don't know
what tomorrow holds.

And MjÃ¶lnir,
MjÃ¶lnir chose you.

It chose you because
you are worthy.

And that's something.

When I first met you,
I was unworthy...

I was unable to
pick up my hammer.

You told me, there was no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

You made me worthy.

So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

Look, what do you wanna do?

I'm gonna get those
children back to their families.

I want to finish that mission.

Spoken like a true Thor.

How do you feel now?

So scared.

How do you feel?

Shitty.

How shitty?

Really shitty.

I wonder what those two
are talking about, out there.

Yeah, they're not talking.

Oh!

Do you think those two will ever
hold hands over a hot lava pool

to make a Thor baby?

Unlikely, sadly.

Oh, that's too bad.

I think Thor would make a great dad.

Hey!
We're here.

This is where color goes.

They're not here.

Where are they?

The hell is this place?

Bifrost is the key.

It's a trap!

Can you tell me why you just threw
Stormbreaker out the window?

He needs it to open the gates of Eternity.

We really have to
stop meeting like this.

Call the ax.

I'll call the ax when
you call the dentist.

Call the ax.

Tell me where the children
are or I'm gonna kill...

Call the ax.

How ungodly you are.

You know nothing

of being a god.

You went to the gods for help

and they did nothing.

We're alike, in that sense.

He's nothing like you.

What was that?

I said, he's nothing like you.

That's right.
I'm not a hypocrite.

I'm truly creating peace.

You're murdering innocent gods.

Innocent?

Are you a Valkyrie?

Huh?

Haha, how exciting.

Oh, my gosh.
They're onto you too.

Your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

Did you pray to the gods...

When the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

Did you beg them for help...

As your family was massacred?

Good chat.

This one...

You're interesting.

You're different.

Yes.

Awh...

You're dying.

I'm sorry.

We're on the same path.

Just as the sword empowered me.

The hammer empowered you.

But it did nothing
to change your fate.

The gods will use you...

But they will not help you.

There is no...

eternal reward...

for us.

She'll be gone soon.

And you know who won't help her?

I give you one guess.

I know your pain.

Love is pain.

I had a daughter once.

I put my faith in a higher power,
hoping it will save her.

And she...

died.

Now I understand...

My daughter is the lucky one.

She does not have to grow up in a world...

Of suffering and pain

run by wicked gods.

Choose love.

Call the ax.

Call the ax.

You okay?
Yeah.

Hmm, I want to kill that guy.

So do I, but we have
to take him alive.

He's our only link to
finding those children.

Oh!
Thank you, Mr. Goat.

Val!

We gotta get her out of here.

I got you.

The goats are here.
Come on, let's go.

Stormbreaker, take us home.

Look, there are other, more aggressive
forms of treatment we can try,

but something's affecting her
body's ability to fight the cancer.

I'm sorry, Thor.

Oh, there you are.

What's going on out there?

Oh, some moron made a fridge
without a door. Can you believe it?

Don't you worry, I got it open
and got you all sorts of goodies.

How's Val?

Oh, she's in a lot of pain,
uh, but she is stable.

Okay, good.

Now, I just gotta get this...

out of my...
Woah! No, no, no.

That's gotta stay in there.

That's all the magic potions
and elixirs doing their thing, so...

Just gonna pop out for a moment.

Pick up the kids.
Uh, kill a bad guy.

And then, I'll come straight back.

You're going without me?

Uh, yeah.

What happened to like...
doing everything together?

He's gonna use those kids
to distract you.

You need me.

I do need you, Jane.

I need you alive.

Would be great to have
you on the battlefield.

Fighting Gorr side by side,

but that hammer is killing you.

Every time you use it,
it's draining all of your mortal strength,

leaving your body unable
to fight the cancer.

What happened to live
like there's no tomorrow?

It was before I knew
you might not have one.

Why not have
one more adventure?

Jane, if there's a chance to live.
You have to take it.

Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

I know, I seem like some cool
astrophysicist from New Mexico.

Just living the dream.

But, look at me.

I wanna keep fighting.

I'm the Mighty Thor.

And you want me not to do that?

What's the point of
more time than this?

Because I love you.

I've always loved you.

And this is a chance, for us.

If you pick up that damn hammer
again, then that chance is gone.

It's your choice, Jane.

But I'd regret it,
every single day.

If I didn't ask you to stay here, so we
can try and figure this out together.

You better come back to me.

I'm coming back,
as soon as I can.

Break a leg.

I'll break all his legs.

Remember that, the gate
to Eternity is at the literal center...

of the universe.
Universe.

You have to pass the comet.
Yes.

Yes, yes. I know.
We've been over this.

I'm not going to get lost.

So how are you feeling
with the old stab wound?

I think I lost my kidney
Gone? Completely?

I wish I could join you, but...

I'd probably die and that
won't help get the kids back.

So you'll have
to go it alone.

All you have to do,
is destroy that sword.

It's his source of power.

You won't survive
long without it.

Hey, don't die.

Hell, no.

Eternity.

Finally.

Hey, kids.

I knew you'd come.

Go, kids.

Everyone okay?

Alright, gather round.
Gather round.

Good to see you, in person.

Thank goodness.

Alright, listen up!
Here's the plan.

We sneak our way towards Stormbreaker,

Being very careful not to bump into,
any of those big shadow monsters.

They're behind me, aren't they?

Does anyone here
have battle experience?

Well, no time to
learn like the present.

But, we're not
strong like you.

We're just kids.

Hey, don't forget.
You're Asgardian kids.

I'm not.

I'm just a Lightfusion.
And I'm a Ligathian kid.

Okay.
Okay.

But today,
you're Asgardians.

Now, collect your weapons.

What?

Go and find anything
you can pick up.

And bring it back here.

Hurry, hurry.

They're getting closer,
hurry up.

Today, is a day that
will go down in history.

Today's a day they'll talk
about for generations to come.

Today, we are Space Vikings!

Present...
arms!

Whosoever
hold these weapons

and believes in going home
if they be true of heart.

is therefore
worthy and shall possess...

For a limited time only.

The power of Thor!

General Axl...

Lead your army
to that ax.

We shall do our work...

For Asgard.

Jane.

Destroy that sword
and he's dead.

The gate is almost open.
You gotta stop Stormbreaker.

It's okay.
I got him.

Stormbreaker, stop this!

Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing.

I'm gonna get you out of there.

Come on!

Let go of my friend!

You've lost, Lady Thor.

First off,

the name is Mighty Thor.

Secondly...

If you can't say Mighty Thor,

I'll accept Dr. Jane Foster!

Thirdly,

eat my hammer!

Stormbreaker!

I knew you could do it.

Axl!
Get them home.

Jane?

I'm okay.

You gotta stop him.

Gorr, stop!

What kind of father
would I be, if I stopped.

I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

It's not death
or revenge that you seek.

What do I seek?

You seek love.

Love?

Why should I seek love?

Because that's all
any of us want.

How dare, you turn
your back on me.

You won, Gorr.

Why would I spend my last moments
with you, when I can be with her?

I choose love.

You can, too.
You can bring her back.

Make your wish.

I'm dying.

She would have no one.

She would be alone.

She won't be alone.

My love.

I've missed you,
so much.

I've missed you, too.

I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

As soon as I picked up that hammer...

It's like...
I've gotten an extra life.

It's just...

Magical.

Not too bad for a human.

Not too bad for a god.

I think I figured
out my catchphrase.

Really? What is it?
Come closer.

Perfect.

It's the best one yet.
Thank you.

Keep your heart open.

I love you.

I love you too.

Protect her.

Protect my love.

Let me tell you the
legend of the Space Viking.

a.k.a

"The Mighty Thor".

a.k.a

"Dr. Jane Foster".

Her sacrifice saved the universe and
taught us all what it means to be worthy.

She helped the
children of the gods.

Who laser beamed
their way back home,

to their dozy, little fishing
village turned tourist destination.

Mommy!

Look at you!

Are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm okay.

Are you sure?
I'm okay.

The kids were safe
to be kids again.

Widen your stance.

Especially after their king, made
them all go to self-defense classes.

Look at all those budding Space Vikings.
And the most important part,

The war cry!

Even Heimdall's son,

Axl Heimdallson,

who could now do his
dad's freaky eye magic,

was becoming
quite the warrior.

The future of Asgard was secure.

Speaking of futures,

I was forging one of my own.

Now, that my body
has grown back.

With a dude I met called Dwayne.

What about Thor, you ask?

He embarked on a new journey.

Because he had found something to live for.

Something to love for.

A little someone who
turned him from sad god

into dad god.

Breakfast is served, bon appetit.

Hello!

There you go!

Hey!
Breakfast!

Excuse me.

What is that?

They're...
They're panflaps from Earth.

I don't think
I like panflaps.

You love them.
No, I don't.

Yes, you do.
Never had that in my life.

Come on, eat up.
We have to go. We're gonna be late.

Now, where are your boots?
I'm wearing them.

You're not wearing those.

Yes, I am.
No, you're not.

Yes, I am.
No, you're not.

Go to hell, demon!

It's brand new.
Now, destroyed.

Thank you very much.

You know what,
you wear what you want.

Don't come complaining to
me when your feet get sore.

Alright, you get no
sympathy here from me.

Ugh, fine.
I'll wear the boots.

Thank you.

I remember what
my mother used to tell me.

Listen to the grown ups.

And if you see anyone
scared or being picked on,

Look after them. Okay?
Okay.

Most of all, have fun.

Gotcha.
Gotcha.

Now, where is MjÃ¶lnir?
Where did I put it?

Over there,
sleeping in the bed.

It's in the bed.

Oh, wow!

That is not coming off.

What did you do?

Eh, she looked boring before.

Ah!

Supposed it did.

I love it.

Very creative.

Okay...

Now, see the aliens down there?
The stripy ones?

They look nice.

Yeah, they are nice.

That's why we have
to look after them.

Got it.

Protect the nice ones.

I love you, sweetie.

Love you, Uncle Thor.

They will always
be there for us.

The Space Viking
and his girl born from Eternity,

with the powers of a god.

Two warrios...

Fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

The have travelled far
and have been given many names.

But to those who know them best,

They're simply known

as Love and Thunder.

It used to be that being a god,
meant something.

People will whisper your name...

Before sharing their
deepest hopes and dreams.

They begged you for mercy...

Without ever knowing,
if you're actually listening.

Now...

You know, they look to the sky.

They don't ask us for lightning.

They don't ask us for rain.

They just want to see one
of their so-called superheroes.

When did we become the joke?

No.

No.

They will fear us again...

When Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

Do you understand me, Hercules?

Do you understand, my son?

Yes, father.

Oh, hey!

Jane Foster.

Heimdall?

I see you're dead now.

Uhh... yeah.

Thank you for looking after my son.

You are very welcome here
to the land of the gods.

Welcome to Valhalla.
