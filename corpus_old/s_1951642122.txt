The guy's been shot, Jesse.

-You found him?
-Yeah.

I'm on the 11:00 to 7:00.

I pulled over to take a leak and saw the dog.

Don't know him.

His wallet and licence are still in his pocket.

Kenneth Eisley.

Big house on the other side of the water.

Another commuter who moved here
looking for paradise.

Well, he found it.

Looks like . 22s.

lt's a murder, isn't it, Jesse?

Probably.

Do you think the tide washed him up here?

A body that's been in the ocean and
washed up on shore doesn't look like that.

-More beat-up.
-Yep.

-He's got some marks on his face.
-That would be the gulls.

I could have lived without knowing that.

-What about shell casings?
-No.

-Maybe the killer picked them up.
-Or used a revolver.

Anthony said on the phone
we got a murder?

You're the crime scene guy, Doc,
but there's two bullet holes in his chest.

That'll be a clue.

-He's not in rigor yet.
-What does that mean?

He ran into his killer
less than two hours ago.

Or killers.

D'Angelo, close the area.

lt's November, Skipper.
Nobody uses it anyway.

This guy did.

What about the dog? He's just sitting there.

Jesse, it's Jenn.

Are you there?

lt's late.
Guess you're asleep or out on a date.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound like that.
I've had a long day.

I was pointing to Teaneck, New Jersey...

when I was giving the forecast
for Long lsland.

Actually, it didn't matter.
Weather girls aren't taken seriously, anyway.

Then I was out all night until now...

and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

I guess I'll talk to you....

...seriously, anyway.

Then I was out all night until now...

and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow.

Hey.

lt's 7:00 in the morning.
What are you doing here?

I'm up early, fighting crime.

-Can you come over tonight?
-I'd be foolish not to.

-We can order in.
-Chinese?

Because you know how erotic I get
when I eat Chinese.

Or when you don't.

Age: 37. Divorced, no children.

His parents live in Amherst.
They've been notified.

Somebody killed him
and they had to have a reason.

Talk with the people he worked with.

Perkins said he'd get to Eisley's autopsy
around lunchtime, Skipper.

D'Angelo, in all the years I've been a cop...

I have never heard the police chief
referred to as "Skipper. "

Chief, there's a couple here
with their daughter. The Penningtons.

-What do they want?
-They didn't want to say...

but I think you need to talk with them.

Call Capt. Healey. Tell him we're sending
the bullets down for ballistics.

Right.

Good morning, folks. I'm Chief Stone.

Please sit down.

-My daughter has been raped.
-Mother!

Molly, you might want to stick around.

-l didn't get raped.
-Please, honey.

She came home late last night.
She tried to slip into the house.

Her jeans were ripped, her hair was a mess,
her lip was bleeding.

I insisted on inspecting her myself.

She had on no underwear
and her thighs were bruised.

Did you take her to the doctor?

And have it all over town? God, no.

I cleaned her up
and brought her straight to you.

Cleaned her up? How?

I put her in a hot bath and scrubbed her
myself, like she was 2 years old.

Who did this to you, Candace?

-l don't want to talk about it.
-You tell them, young lady.

Candace, if we don't know who did it,
it might happen again...

to somebody else or to you.

-Tell the Chief what happened right now.
-No hitting.

Molly, take Candace outside.

Come with me, Candace.

lsn't there some kind of a test?

A hot bath tends to wash away
that kind of evidence...

-but the hospital might be able to tell us--
-No, I won't take her.

Margaret.

This incident must remain confidential.
Can you promise me that?

Of course not.

We don't plan to blab about it.
But if there's a trial, people will find out.

We can't discuss this any further.

I want my daughter,
and we're going home now.

I've said what I have to say.

-Mrs. Pennington, why don't you let us--
-l have nothing to say to you.

Anything you want to tell me?

Poor kid. What are we gonna do?

You heard her mother.
She doesn't want a scandal.

So we're not gonna do anything?

I didn't say that.
Why don't you go down to the high school?

-And do what?
-Keep an eye on her.

-Find out who did this.
-How?

You'll think of something.

-Am I late?
-No.

You can't invite someone over for dinner...

and just plunk down cartons of food
on the table.

Of course you can't.
I just wanted to see if you knew that.

Yeah, right.

-There's a dog in here.
-Yeah.

Where are you going?

Do you want water?

Wine.

The floor's gotten cold.

The season's over.

I'm worried.

Someone will find him.

I just couldn't kill a dog.

Let it go. Let's go, Reggie.

Go, boy. Ready?

-You ever met him?
-Who?

-The baseball player on your wall.
-Ozzie? No.

But he was the best shortstop I ever saw.

Would you have been that good
if you hadn't been hurt?

I might have made the show,
but I wouldn't have been Ozzie.

Do you miss it?

Every day.

Why do you think we get along?

I don't know.

We're an odd pair. I'm way too old for you.

So why do you think we get along?

-Because we're pals.
-Pals that have sex.

You're like me.

You won't commit to a relationship
just to have it.

Neither one of us requires a commitment
from the other.

Which produces a kind of commitment
to each other.

I don't mean this in any negative way...

but you may be the simplest person
I've ever met.

You know what you know, you do
what you do, and you just keep doing it.

-Like a mule.
-Or a jackass.

One shot, straight through the heart.

The other clipped the descending aorta.

You want all the details
about what got penetrated?

I'll read the report.

Looks like 40 grain, standard velocity,
$10-a-brick ammunition.

Almost like a pro.

Shots entered the body
about 30 degrees apart.

What's that mean to you?

I don't know, Jess.
I'm a paediatrician most of the time.

This is the first murder I've seen.

You must have seen
lots of stuff like this in LA.

lt could mean that the victim moved
after the first shot hit him.

Or one shooter with two guns.

Or two shots at the same time
from two shooters.

We should pull
all the city and state firearm records.

Good luck.
Everyone in the state owns a . 22.

We could cross-reference
for people who live in and around--

lf it was bought in Massachusetts,
if the gun store did its paperwork...

if we didn't lose it in the computer,
and if they live in Paradise.

We've got him cornered.

-What, so we shouldn't?
-No, go ahead. We have to.

But smart criminals
don't use registered guns to commit murder.

-You think he's smart?
-He or she.

Hey, Pennington.

What? No hello?

You see these? Don't you say a thing.

Actually, that's my favourite.

You say anything and you're dead.

Listen, I'll have to call you back.

Does that translate to, "I've lD'd the rapist"?

-There's a dog in here.
-Witness protection.

Bo Marino.

-The football player.
-Football star and two of his teammates.

Bo showed something to Candace
that scared the hell out of her.

-You know who the boys were with Marino?
-Kevin Feeney and Troy Drake.

-You got anything else?
-Not yet.

You got a plan?

I'm going to haunt them.

-You have to work here some time.
-My time.

-lt's company time, too. Company business.
-lt's women's business.

Men may know things women don't.

Yes, but rape is one of the things we know.

So I'm going to haunt them.

Don't lean so close....

Higher!

-Are you done with your paper?
-Yeah, you can have it.

-Thanks so much.
-Yeah, just keep it.

-See something you like?
-Yes. Take a look at this.

-l didn't know you were shooting this.
-I'm always shooting.

But ljust wanted to read it.

She's the one.

She was nice.

She wanted to borrow my paper.

-You think she's good-looking?
-l think she's great-looking.

-Well, see you later.
-Thanks.

She looks kind of horsy to me.

She's the one.

How does it make you feel
that she's sleeping with other men?

-She has every right.
-But how does it make you feel?

lt makes me want to kill
every man she's with.

But you don't.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

You know that I'm a wiser person than you.

Which gives you the right
to offer me advice.

Yes. lt's a rule.

Jesse, you've been divorced now for what,
five years?

-And you advise me to forget about Jenn?
-l do.

-ls anyone advising you otherwise?
-No.

lf you could resolve this thing with Jenn...

then maybe you could put
this drinking thing behind you, too...

and just be a really good police chief.

I've never been drunk on the job.

You have never been drunk on the job here.

Good point.

-So?
-So?

Are you suggesting that I shut up?

No. Your advice is good.

lt's just not good for me.

Nobody's touched the body.

Who was she?

Her driver's licence says Barbara Carey.

Notice she got shot, just like the last guy.

-Yeah, I noticed.
-Thought I'd mention it.

D'Angelo, I want pictures of all the cars
in the parking lot...

licence plates so we can read them.

-All of them?
-Yeah.

Who's going to pay for the film?

I will.

-You think the killer's still here?
-Would you be?

You okay?

He's interesting.

I didn't notice.

They're taking down licence plates.

-They'll find our names.
-So?

They'll find a lot of other names, too.

You think they'll bring us in
for questioning?

Small-town force.

I don't think they've got the manpower.

lt might be kind of exciting if they did.

-You need a ride?
-What do you want?

To talk.

lf you want to slump down so nobody
sees you, I won't take it personally.

There's a dog here.

What's his name?

-What do you think his name is?
-Reggie?

You think he looks like a Reggie?

lt's what it says on his collar.

Bo Marino, Kevin Feeney, and Troy Drake.

We both know they raped you.

And we both know they threatened you
about telling.

-How do you know?
-I'm the police chief. I know everything.

lf you let them...

they will make your life miserable
for as long as you live in this town.

lf you tell me about it,
I can give you your life back.

-My mother is....
-l can help you with your mother.

I want you to call me...

any time, about anything.

This will be just between you and me...

until you say otherwise. lt's our secret.

What are you going to do?

I'm going to haunt them.

-You won't tell?
-No.

But we're in this together, okay?

Okay.

-How come you're not in uniform?
-Casual Tuesday.

-Skip Wilder, Boston Herald.
-No comment.

You came all the way up from Boston
to pick up two bullets?

I came to see
if I could be of some assistance.

I didn't bring him.

Find out if he drives a black BMW.
One was following me around.

Did you get the licence number, Skipper?

-You heard?
-I heard.

-Same m. o. ?
-Same m. o.

No obvious motive?

I think it might be random.

I'm the State Homicide Commander.
I'm not God.

-l thought they were the same thing.
-Think how disappointed I am.

lt could be a long process.

The sooner we confirm it, the sooner
we'll have the national media on us.

The process just got longer.

Thanks.

Suit?

Write me up a paper for the local paper
about how we have this all under control?

-Me?
-Yeah, you're good at that.

-l am?
-Yeah.

-Do we?
-What?

Have it all under control.

-Your wife's on Line 3.
-Ex-wife.

Call me.

Hi.

-How are you doing up there?
-You heard.

I heard.

How about I drive up tomorrow?

This isnt a very good time, Jenn.

-I want to see you.
-Me, too

-I'm very disappointed.
-l know.

-Working too hard, Jesse.
-l know.

What about therm?

ls there any reason to think
the killings are related?

We have two killings.

We're not sure whether it's the same weapon
or weapons.  Thank you.

Larry, Curly, and Moe want to talk with you.

On behalf of the Town Council...

Jim, Carter and I thought we ought to
get brought up tp speed on things.

So, what's really going on?

-That's all you know?
-Correct.

Correct.

-Hell.
-I told you he wasn't a talker.

-So what do we tell the press?
-l like "no comment. "

Over at the hight school?

Maybe you could allocate your personnel
a little better.

Damn it, don't you talk?

Only when I have something to say.

Couldn't we get this thing resolved quicker
with FBl or State help?

The FBl and State Police
bring the national media.

You won't like this town
when they're through with it.

I'm a cop. I've been a cop for a long time.
I'm good at it.

-l know how to do this. You don't.
-Damn it, we can fire you.

You can. But you can't tell me what to do.

You know that I'm wiser than you.

Is this friendly advice,
or are you speaking as the town lawyer?

I'm speaking as your pal.

You want to come over tonight
and make dinner?

Don't change the subject,
and don't piss them off.

-No bones.
-That sounds good.

-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

Don't piss off the Town Council, Jesse.

So, shall we say 7?

I know.

-What do you think?
-She's too young for him.

She's about your age.

Well, I'm more worldly.

Does the killer scare you?

Don't shrug. I want you to answer.

I suppose I'd be an idiot not to be scared.

-Would you shoot him?
-lf I had to.

-Have you ever shot anyone before?
-Yes.

Did you kill them?

Yes.

-Do you want to tell me about it?
-No.

So you shot him dead?

-Did you mean to?
-Yes.

You didn't try to wound him,
shoot him in the leg or something?

He had a machete.

lt feels like you can't catch your breath,
there's a guy with a machete...

you aim centre of mass
and try not to jerk the trigger.

You've got about half a second
to figure out what needs to be done.

I guess you need to be that way
if you're a policeman.

Maybe I'm a policeman
because I am that way.

Do you think the killings are connected?

-Don't shrug. Do you have a guess?
-l try not to.

Sure, but you're not just a cop.

You are, after all, also a person.

I'm better at being a cop,
and it's best if cops don't hope.

I'm not so sure you're a
better cop than a person.

I know. Thank you.

He was shot up here. He must have fallen.

-Family?
-Wife, three daughters.

I'll talk to them.

And they won't have any idea
why someone killed him.

I'll ask if they know Kenneth Eisley
and Barbara Carey...

and they won't. And we'll find
no connection between the three of them.

lt's the same, only different.

We've got a witness.

-l want to talk to him.
-Okay.

Philly, this is Chief Stone.
Tell him what you told me.

Sure.

The streets need paving.
With unpaved streets, it's very dangerous.

Water in the streets,
the street's full of holes.

Now, Philly, you told me you saw some cars.

Police cars, too.

Well, there was one car. A red Explorer.

You sure about that?

Hold it there a minute, Bo.

You can't come in here.

-You're using a controlled substance.
-A what?

-This is a men's room.
-I'd like you to come down to the station.

Screw you, lady.

-Don't make me arrest you.
-You?

Get the hell out of my way.

-You have the right to remain silent.
-You crazy bitch!

lf you give up that right,
everything you say...

could be taken down and used against you
in a court of law.

Watch yourself.

So, he could have gotten the colour wrong.

Exactly. And besides,
just because the car was in both places...

hell, there's maybe
20, 000 red Explorers in the state.

Maybe 2, 000 in the county.

And that assumes
they stayed around and watched us.

On the other hand,
at least we have a credible witness.

Chief Stone.

Your secretary called ahead.
Andrew Lincoln.

-And this is my wife, Brianna.
-Hello.

-Hello. This is Officer Simpson.
-Hi.

Please, come in.

Suit, why don't you wait here?

-What did you just call him?
-Suit.

Short for "suitcase. "

Like Harry "Suitcase" Simpson,
the baseball player?

Exactly.

-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

So, is this about the killings?

Yes, ma'am, it is. Your car
was in the parking lot of a murder scene.

Where that woman was shot.

That's where we first saw you,
investigating the crime scene.

How was I doing?

I was wondering if you own any guns,
specifically a . 22?

We do. Registered, of course. A . 22 rifle.

We used to plink vermin
at our country home from time to time.

I was wondering if I could borrow it
for a couple of days.

We'll just test-fire it
so we can cross you off the list.

-Of course, Chief Stone.
-Jesse.

I'll go get it.

It's a great view, isn't it?

On a cop's salary,
I could never afford a view like that.

Enjoy the seaside, then get to Palm Beach
so we don't freeze to death.

Good idea. What do you do, Mr. Lincoln?

I used to be an ophthalmologist.
I invented an ocular scanning device...

that uses laser refraction
to detect corneal depth. lt's....

Anyway....

So you don't practise medicine anymore?

Why? Do you have something in your eye?

-Mrs. Lincoln?
-Brianna.

-Brianna, do you work?
-No, not now.

We've been together about 15 years.

ln that whole time,
we've never had an argument.

-lt'd be pretty suspicious if we didn't.
-Have a fight?

-No, let you borrow the rifle.
-lt would.

I hope you get the son of a bitch, Jesse.

People come up from the city
and think they own the place.

Well, they do.

-He seemed nice.
-Just a stupid cop.

He didn't seem stupid to me.
He seemed polite.

He was staring at your ass, for God's sake.

I told you he wasn't stupid.

I'll have the lab check the rifle for ballistics.

And you feel in order to certify our copness,
we need to scarf these down?

Yes, I do.

-You're not going to eat a dozen donuts?
-Sooner or later.

You're right, it's been too long.

I want to know everything
about Andy and Brianna.

where they live, where their country home
is, where they plink vermin...

where he practiced medicine,
where he went to school.

"Plink vermin. "

Who the hell talks like that?
People don't talk like that.

As soon as we fire the thing, we'll know.

We'll know the bullets weren't fired
from that gun.

-What, do you think they have another gun?
-Two.

-And you think they did it?
-Yes.

You have everything you need but evidence.

-Except motive.
-Yeah, that, too.

But you never told them
about their car being at the parking lot.

There's no need to tell them all we know.

Because you've got some kind of instinct?

Because there's something
very phoney about them.

But they're the only phonies whose car
was parked 10 feet from a homicide.

So, you gonna arrest me, or what?

-I'm walking out of here.
-No, you're not.

-You think you can stop me?
-Of course I can.

You're all show muscle.

Hell, a 1 20-pound woman
hauled you in here in handcuffs.

-Who's the young lady?
-l don't know.

I found those pictures.

-Where?
-School library.

Somebody must have dropped them.

You aren't one of these guys
holding her down, are you?

Do you see my face
in any of those pictures?

You don't have to say any more, Bo.

Rita Fiore. I'm Mr. Marino's attorney
and his son's.

-l didn't do anything, Dad.
-What the hell is going on?

I'm holding Mr. Marino's son
on a controlled substance charge.

You brought my kid in for smoking pot?

You're looking at a police brutality suit.
I'll tell you right now.

Shut up, Mr. Marino.

We've arrested your client
for possession of a controlled substance...

with intent to sell, resisting a lawful order,
and assaulting a police officer.

And then there is the matter
of these pictures.

I could see my way to releasing Bo...

if he would identify
the boys holding her down.

Chief Stone, my client is 17 years old.

He has no previous convictions.

You're not really gonna
keep him here overnight, are you?

I am.

I want you to understand something, Bo.

You deny knowing the people
in these pictures.

lf you're lying to us,
it would be wise if you told us right now...

with your attorney present.

I don't know them.

Officer Crane, please take Mr. Marino
to the holding cell.

Come on.

-You son of a bitch.
-Chief son of a bitch to you.

Unless you want to spend
the night here, too...

I suggest you and Miss Fiore go someplace
and plan your brutality suit.

I'll meet you outside.

Healey told me you were....
What did he say? lt was kind of cute.

Oh, yeah.
He said you were a real straight shooter.

That is cute.

See you.

-Why're you keeping the kid overnight?
-Because I don't like him.

How was the father?

The tree doesn't grow too far
from the apple.

lf you flip one of the other kids,
there might be a plea-bargain...

and she'd never have to appear.

You look tired, Jesse.

You can only do what you can do.

lf the killings aren't random...

they're certainly connected
in a way only the killers understand.

Suit said you've got a feeling.

Cop-ly intuition.

So, what are you gonna do?

I'm gonna eat my pizza and mull.

Mulling's good.

-Good night, Jesse.
-Good night, Moll.

I know you're married,
but maybe we could have an affair.

I'll put you on the list.

Anyway, there's this banquet hall...

and it's brightly lit,
and there's a big, warm fire.

And outside, it's cold and dark.

But inside, everybody's eating and drinking
and having a hell of a time.

And a sparrow flies
into one end of the hall...

out of the cold darkness.

He flies through the bright, warm hall
and out the other end...

into the cold darkness again.

So?

Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

Or was it a swallow?

I don't remember. But the point's the same.

We're only here for a little while
and we have the right to make the most of it.

Yeah, I know, Reggie.

"You can only do what you can do. "

Do you know Bo Marino?

-Did he take those pictures?
-l don't know.

-Was someone holding her feet?
-l don't know anything.

Okay, Kevin.

I'm gonna have to arrest you
for sexual assault.

-No, wait a minute.
-Am I going to jail?

We have pictures of you...

forcibly restraining a naked young woman
who is crying.

There's probably a crime
in there someplace.

Tell him, Kevin. Was it Bo Marino?

-Do you want to go to jail?
-He'll be pissed at me.

Was it Bo Marino?

Yes.

Who else?

Yes.

-He's never been in trouble before.
-Now he is

-But he's not gonna go to jail, is he?
-Not tonight.

But, Mrs. Feeney, your son participated
in the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl.

He'll have to answer for that.

What else?

through 1990.

They have two cars.
the red Explorer and a black BMW.

How'd you know that?

I'm the police chief. I know everything.
Listen, I have to call you back.

Hold that thought!

-Miss Fiore.
-Save the "Miss" for court.

ls this a house call?

Pour me a drink, would you?
A very large, very dry martini.

-You have kettle One?
-I do.

My plan was for you to be so taken
with me that you'd do whatever I wanted.

lt's working.

That was a lousy way to get
Bo charged with sexual assault.

He deserved it.

I could take you apart in court for that.

But if I did, how would I get you into bed?

-Mostly, I'm thinking 'wow'.
-Good.  I like 'wow'.

ln the small moments,
between thinking "wow"...

Try not to babble.

I had to know what I was dealing with.

You were a homicide detective
in Los Angeles...

but your marriage went south
and you had a drinking problem.

-How's the marriage?
-Still south.

-And the drinking?
-Better.

I also know that
you have a serial killer operating here.

-You must be stretched pretty thin.
-We are.

But you still had time
to run down this rape thing.

Usually, you get into
one of these small, suburban towns...

they have a homicide,
and the State Police take over pretty quickly.

We try to handle as much
as we can in-house.

Buy me dinner!

I'll dress up.

Fluff up my body a little.

Wow.

I know how much pressure
you must be under now...

But we agreed that
if we blew the whistle and corroborated...

we might not get them, and that would
make her life very difficult in Paradise.

They were gonna show my picture
to everyone.

Now they probably won't.

I'll give a statement.
I'll testify, if I have to.

-Get off me!
-You can't go in.

This is all bullshit. Kevin Feeney lied.

-I'm sorry, Skipper.
-lt's all right, Tony.

Close the door behind you.

My kid told you he didn't threaten her.

He told her that if she testified
against him, he'd kill her...

Come on, it's just his
word against hers.

-Don't force me to make that choice.
-What's that supposed to mean?

lt means I have found Bo
to be a chronic liar.

I didn't do anything to the little bitch.

Let go of my son!

Arrest him! I want that son of a bitch
arrested for assault.

I promise they won't assault you again.

What?

You saw the whole thing.

I saw you and Bo insult Candace
Pennington and attack her father.

No, that's the way I saw it.

Me, too.

He punched my kid for no reason.

I think there was a reason.

What, the picture of you in my bedroom?

What do you do with it
when you have a sleepover?

-So, what do you think?
-About sleepovers?

No, about me coming up.
See, every news outlet in the country...

is dying for some sort of
inside something on this.

I know.

I thought I could come out with
a cameraman and track the investigation.

An inside look at how you're handling it.

-No.
-We could do a whole series about it.

-No, Jenn.
-I'd stay out of the way.

Hey, Abby.

Hey, Jesse.

Two in the chest, just like the others.

Cold morning.
Might make the time of death a little harder.

Hey, Doc.

Not now.

Jesse, I'm sorry.

Maybe I should just say, "The hell with it, "
and be a drunk.

I don't see what purpose is served
by locking these children up.

You think they didn't know it was wrong?
That they couldn't control themselves?

-Well, they didn't.
-No plea-bargains. They deserve jail time.

Right now, Candace can't imagine
going to school tomorrow.

She cannot imagine facing all the kids
that will know...

she was gang-raped
and photographed naked...

and the three guys who did it
will be in the same school with her.

Maybe the same class.

I may not be a little girl anymore,
but I am a woman.

And as a woman, I sympathise with her.

Did the court specify
the community service?

Not yet.

Let me have each of them in a cell for
an hour. Let me beat the crap out of them.

-You're joking?
-l am.

But why not let them serve their sentence
with the police department?

You would, of course, take your
supervisory responsibilities seriously.

I would bust their chops

I'll see what I can do.

What about unsolved murders
in the Cleveland area?

A young girl was shot at a bus stop
in Parma, which is near Cleveland.

I know where Parma is.

The only thing that matches this m. o...

are two killings in Hilton Head, 1999...

and three in Florida, 2002.

Where in Florida?

There's a guy from CNN here.
He wants to speak with you.

He won't like that.

There's a press briefing every morning.
Tell him where and when.

Okay.

Maybe now we can get a search warrant.

No judge is gonna give us a search warrant
with what we've got.

And the weapons won't be there.

-We can try.
-l don't want them to stop!

That's good work.

You may make Detective someday.

We don't have any detectives.

Well... if we did.

I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

She wasn't my girlfriend. She was my pal.

No, thank you.

-You're not drinking?
-l don't drink.

I did, but I don't.

The DA went for your plan.
So what are you gonna do?

I'm gonna take them over to Doc Perkins
and have them sterilised.

The Marino family wants me
to file charges against you.

-lt all happened so quickly.
-I'm sure.

I could tell you're kind of slow to react.

Bo attacked Candace's dad
who responded in self-defence.

Then Joe Marino jumped in and Chuck
had to defend himself from both of them.

I was a prosecutor in a previous life.

Don't beat yourself up.

lt's the toughest kind of case:
motiveless, random killing.

lt seems that serial killers only screw up
when it gets personal.

So, when do we go to court?

This one isn't a winner for our side.

I'll persuade my clients to drop it.

-And if they won't?
-They'll drop it.

So, off the record, what really happened
with Bo and his father?

Pennington smacked the crap out of Bo
and his old man, and I let him.

-I'm shocked.
-Not that shocked.

lt'll be our secret.

Perhaps before we're through,
there'll be several more.

Ballistics came back on the third victim.

Same as the first two. Same two guns.

-Who else knows about this?
-So far, just you and me.

lt's freezing out here.

The day I left LAPD,
I drove out to Santa Monica...

and just looked out at the ocean.

I lost my wife and my job. lt calmed me.

-Are you feeling that way now?
-No.

I'm angry.

They killed my friend.

So you think it was intentional,
this killing your friend?

Yes.

I know who did this.

I know who killed Eisley,
the woman in the parking lot...

The guy in ther alley, and Abby...

I know who killed them.

-Do you have a motive?
-No.

-Witnesses?
-No.

Hell, I'll warm up a cell right now.

There's two of them.

And they're not gonna stop. I won't let them.

So these two people,
they have an interest in killing people...

and now they seem to have an interest
in killing you?

ls this a great country or what?

Jesse, you might want to be a little careful
with these people.

-I'm a little careful with everyone.
-The hell you are.

lt would not be good to take this personally.

I've been at this thing too long to be wrong.

I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for someone to find another body.

You just love to make me nervous.

Need a ride?

He's going to see you.

That sounds good.

-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

I think he looks worried.

Maybe we've been too hard on him.

Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

This is Reggie.

Thought you might need this.

-They took a ballistics test?
-Yes, we did. We sent it to Boston.

Come into the living room.
Brianna doesn't wanna miss you.

Bri, honey, it's Jesse.

I assume it's not linked
to a drive-by shooting or anything.

Actually, the rifle's never been fired.

So much for plinking vermin.

-Must have been one of your other . 22s.
-No.

I have no other guns.

Jesse Stone.

-Brianna.
-Hello.

What a beautiful dog you brought!

Hello. What a sweet doggie.

Hello, you little noodle.

Actually, I've kind of adopted him.
He belonged to the first victim.

Well, that's awfully good of you.

How sweet.

-l think he likes you.
-Of course he likes me.

You going someplace?

Well, like we said,
we're only here a short time.

-When do you leave?
-Tomorrow night.

-How's the investigation going?
-Actually, not too good.

I hope the victims didn't suffer too much.

I wonder what it's like
to know you're gonna die.

Have you ever been in that position, Jesse?

I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

lt must make everything very intense.

I always wondered what it was like
for the shooter. That must be intense.

Exercising the ultimate human power.

-lf he thinks about that kind of stuff.
-Do you think he does?

I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

-Do you have any leads?
-l was pinning my hopes on you.

Everyone needs a hobby.

Seriously, though,
why would we do such a thing?

A shared sickness.

At least we would be sharing.

Who was the last victim?

A friend of mine.

Abby Taylor. I read that in the paper.

lt must be very hard
when it's someone so close to you.

I'm sorry.

So am l.

Abigail, oh, Abigail
Have you met Abigail?

The queen of the tattooed ladies

How is it?

My mother is kind of sulky.

-And your father?
-Daddy's great.

I never saw him fight with anybody before,
for me.

-You didn't try to stop it.
-He was winning.

Daddy boxed in college.

He must have been pretty good.
There's not a mark on his face.

-Did you ever box?
-l don't box, I fight.

-What's the difference?
-Rules.

So, how is it at school?

Sometimes Bo or Troy will stare at me
when I go past.

But they don't say anything.

Everyone else, most of the kids,
have been okay about it.

Good.

I want you to know
I appreciate what you did for me.

-Could you do me a favour?
-Sure.

Reggie here has got no owner, no family.

I'm never home...

and he really needs someone
to look after him.

-Could you do that?
-l don't know, my mum--

I can talk to your mum about it.

But you have to take care of him.

-Feed him, walk him, clean up after him.
-l know.

I can do it.

I know you can.

What?

I'm sorry about your friend.

Thank you, Candace.

-So, why Abby?
-Because she was close to me.

-So you think they want to kill you next?
-l kind of wish they'd try.

I know they're not finished.

They know where you live. Why don't
they lurk around your house and shoot you?

They want to do something more artistic.

They are crazy. I tend to forget that.

I think they made a mistake.

lt's not random anymore.

They seem to want to taunt me,
see my reaction.

You might want to think
about being a little careful.

I need evidence.

You think they'll come at you the same way?

Serial killers like ritual.
They'll do it the same.

Jesse, you're a good man and a good cop.
Better than this town deserves.

lt matters what happens to you.

The ugly truth of it, Moll,
is it doesn't matter a hell of a lot to me.

A lot of people love you, Jesse.

-lncluding you?
-Especially me.

And don't shut me off by being cute.

lt's hard for me not to be cute.

I think Reggie will be good for Candace.
That was sweet.

I don't know if I thanked you enough
for all that you've done for me.

I mean, you did so much,
and now maybe Reggie and....

Well, ljust wanted you to know that
I'm your friend...

and I feel really close to you.

-It's Jesse

Listen, I need to see you
both beofre you leave.

The parking lot by the canal,
where Abby Taylor was killed. You know.

-When?
-Tonight, 10. 00.

ls this official?

He thinks he's setting some sort of trap.

-Can he do anything?
-lt doesn't matter.

This just makes it easier.
Now we know where he'll be.

Why am I here, again?

That's lovely and chivalrous of you...

and I know you do it because you
care about me, but it's still dreaming.

-You see anything, Sult?
-Nothing yet

That's why I've got you, Molly.

Jesse, I don't think they're coming.

We'll get there as soon as we can.
You got that, Suit?

On our way.

-l won't have a dog in my house.
-This is different.

-I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

Dad.

Margaret, this means so much to her.

-You know the rule.
-Can't we bend the rule this time?

Reggie needs a home.

You know how I feel
about animals in the house.

He's a great dog. He's already housebroken.

-I promise, I'll take care of him.
-Margaret.

-But I really want him.
-l won't have a dog in my house.

-This is different. I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

Candace isn't home.

Pick it up.

-And let you execute me?
-Pick it up.

I didn't shoot anybody.

I may do some jail time,
but no court of law will execute me.

I'll outlive you, Jesse.

Get up.

Put the gun away, Suit,
before you shoot somebody.

You all right?

Two guns, one shooter.

Give that to Healey.

What are you looking at?

Jesse, are you there?

I'm sorry.

I want you to know that I realise I was
thinking only about myself and my career.

And I know
I've often been that way with you.

Jesse, are you there?
