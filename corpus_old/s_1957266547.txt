ï»¿1
of America,

there's a small town

struggling with people trying
to make a life for themselves.

And this town
ain't no different.

We get up in the morning,

we work hard all day,

and we say our prayers
every night.

But it's not 40 years ago...

and fortunes around here
have been fading fast.

Blessed or cursed,

it was my father...

who won this bar
in a card game

over Blitzer's German bakery.

But lately,
I've been wondering...

whether it's my luck...

her pulse...

or time's magic kiss...

that'll restore her charms.

The friends I've kept
over the years

have stayed the same.

Some would call that noble.

To others, it'd be foolish.

But to me,

they're all I've ever known.

There we were,

just five guys going together

in separate directions.

Just trying to work out an understanding of who we are...

and what's best for us in life.

I got your page, buddy.

Let me back this out
for you, okay?

Vikings plus ten,
equals at the points,

two dime parlay.

Okay, hot size, both Bears
and Tampa Bay,

four o'clock, you want the Pats
over the 9ers in a pick 'em.

It's two and eighty
gets the spread.

You can't live without it?

Well, I'm not gonna tell
Missy a goddamn thing.

No. Hey, on the off-chance that you come out ahead, buddy,

I still pay off.

One o'clock, Mondays,
The Florentine.

"Bad Ass" Bobby Williams.

Moving around like he's got
the whole town on lockdown.

Look at him,

filling his ribbon
on the street.

Well, this explains
why my numbers are off.

Sheets are down
at the high schools.

Same kid used to book
bets at McManus, right?

That's it.


you draw on a guy with a rep,

wind up with a second asshole.

Now, every
nailed-back motherfucker

and his brother
make a move on it.

Hey, Pretty. Just the asshole
I wanna see.

What's up, Bob?

Tryin' to make a monkey
out of me?

No. Whatever gave you
that impression?

Well, my wallet for one.
Don't fuck me off.

Listen,
I ain't skipping or nothin',

I just got jammed up
with these broads and all.

-You know how that goes, right?
-No, not really.

You know,
I wasn't banging broads

a week before my fights.

Listen, it's 2,200
since the final four.

Unless you wanna be picking up
your teeth with broken hands,

-I'd pay me.
-I'm not hanging you out,

you know that.

Listen, I got a purse
coming my way

this week, Friday.

And when it comes, I promise
you'll get a slice of it.

And then we'll really
get moving on things.

A big slice,
with all the toppings,

because I'm getting
real hungry these days.

-Okay.
-Oh, and, Pretty,

if we're not smooth by Saturday
morning after the fight,

Chloe and Coco
gonna read about it,

if they can.

[tapping on window]

his hand.

No big deal.

He don't know that the price
of poker just gone up.


do you know what the eighth
wonder of the world is?

Frankie, I don't know.

Let me guess.

The electric...

target pussy.

No.

But I like the way
you're thinking.

No, my friend,
it is compound interest.

That's the...

That's the great invention
you want to tell me about?


Okay. So, here's what
I was thinking.

Say, you and me,
throwing our lots in together,

get us a small stake,
I'm thinking a few grand, right?

We'll lay it out on the street
for a percentage.

Soft loads.

I'm thinking maybe a deuce a
week, you know, keep it working.

Push it back out,
whack it back up,

do you have any idea
how much fuckin' money

you and I would have
after five years?

Don't move your head.

What?

You know why?

-[Frankie] Huh?
-Well, I figure

if you tilt it over
to one side or the other,

your fucking brain's
gonna fall out.

[Frankie chuckles] Fuck.


Look, man,
the fucking vig alone

will eat your kids,
look at that.

Um, did you do all this stuff
for Molly,

for the wedding,
you ordered the flowers?

I--

-The altar?
-[Frankie] Listen.

My cousin Dukie's girlfriend,

she got a piece of an FTD,

she's gonna give 'em to us
at a cost.

So Wednesday before the wedding,
we go over there

like a pack of fucking monkeys.

Pick that place quick.

I do appreciate it.

Take a big load off my mind.

-Thanks, Frankie.
-[glasses clink]

Anytime.

I mean that.
You can count on me.

What's up Whitey's ass
with this wedding?

They come together,
it's a last-minute affair.

throw on it, you know.

Jack ain't got two nickels
lumped together.

And for Whitey,
it's his only sister.

-You know how he is.
-[Bobby] He's from a tribe.

Right, keeps his people.

Why in the world would Whitey
wanna hire Cozy for this

-fucking wedding anyway?
-I don't know. He's traditional,

-he's Catholic.
-Yeah, he's Catholic, all right.

He was at The Last Supper,
he just didn't stick around

-for the picture.
-[Truby chuckles]

Let me run a name through
your meter,

tell me what you think.
Nicky Napolitano.

-Fucking Victor Moon.
-[Bobby] Exactly,

without the paycheck.

He's the young Dean Martin,
he knows how to carry himself.

Is Nicky expensive?

He owes me heavy, though.

I'd get him at a bargain.

[whipped cream squirting]

The apron, that's Ms. Fuck Eyes?

Okay.
Can I just tell you things?

You know, they're really...
heading that way.

I'm bringing that
to the wedding.

Oh, yeah.

But I still have
to ask her, but...

to pull your cards, Truby.

What do you know
from love, you know?

A broad like that,
who knows what she wants?

A guy with a car?
Someone to smack her around?

Money with a big dick?

Dangerous for a guy like you.

Bobby, I'm trying to date her,
not outwit her.

She ain't a cyclops.
She's, what? A counter waitress.

How hard is that?

is a fucking nightmare.

You know what she's good at?
Walking,

because she ain't stopped
for two fucking seconds

since I got here.

Oh.

Bobby, did you--
Did you hear of Teddy Finn?

All right. Okay, my mother's
at the 6:30 every day,

Father Quill lets out with,
"Teddy Finn's

-coming back to town."
-The altar boy?

-You gotta be kidding me.
-[Truby] No, that's what I hear,

I guess things
didn't work out for him.

He's supposed to be heading
back east.

You don't think he knows
Molly's getting married, do you?

I don't know.


What are the odds of that?

What are the odds
that motherfucker

blowing into town now?

Teddy fucking Finn.


Oh.

Oh, my God. Look at this.

I can't believe this.

-[Brenda scoffs]
-And guest.

-And stripper.
-[Vikki scoffs]


Who?

Your Uncle Danny's
bringing his...

dancer friend.

-Exotic dancer.
-[Molly] Oh, my God.

Where are we gonna seat them?

Well, why don't we put them
at Trisha's table?

No, because Mike and Kelly
are sitting there

and she's Jonie's cousin

and we won't get through
the salad course

before Michael starts in
on them.

Hey, what do you expect though
when you leave your wife

for some 19-year-old stripper,
what, no one's gonna talk

-about it?
-[Molly] You know, I met her

and she's... She's nice.

I just don't know what she sees
in a creep like that, you know?

Brenda, he's Molly's uncle.

Not by blood.

Yeah, but I was the flower girl
at his wedding, okay?

I was at that wedding, too,
and he hit on me.



He did not hit on you.

You know, you-- Ow!

This is my wedding...

...and I just want it
to go really well

with no drama.

So, seat them wherever you want

as long as they're far away
from me, okay?

The kiddie table.


with kids, right?

He's great with kids,
obviously.

Come on, he belongs
at the kiddie table.


["Ring Them Bells"
by Bob Dylan playing]

â™ª Ring them bells,
Sweet Martha â™ª

â™ª For the poor man's son â™ª

â™ª Ring them bells
So the world will know â™ª

â™ª That God is one â™ª

â™ª Oh, the shepherd
is asleep â™ª

â™ª Where the willows weep â™ª

â™ª And the mountains
are filled â™ª

â™ª With lost sheep â™ª

â™ª Ring them bells â™ª

â™ª For the blind and the deaf â™ª

â™ª Ring them bells â™ª

â™ª For all of us who are left â™ª

â™ª Ring them bells â™ª

â™ª For the chosen few â™ª

â™ª Who will judge the many â™ª

â™ª When the game is through â™ª

â™ª Ring them bells â™ª

â™ª For the time
that flies â™ª

â™ª For the child that cries â™ª

â™ª When innocence dies... â™ª

for I have sinned.

I haven't confessed
in, uh, 100 years.

[Father Quill] I haven't heard
that voice in a long time.

Is there anything
you want to talk about?

I'm not having any problems
with the faith or...

impure thoughts...

but if you could call down
a blessing...

I sure could use a...

place to stay for a few days...

and maybe, you know...

help out around the church.

The foxes have their holes...

the birds have their nests...

but son of man has nowhere
to lay his head.

Is that it?

Yeah, something like that.

[Father Quill] You still got
that long second toe?



[Father Quill] Teddy...

Yes?

[Father Quill] Stay here
for as long as you like.

Until your heart starts
to beat of the good again.

If you need anything,
just ask.

If it's money...

make sure it's only a little.

[Teddy laughs]

[Father Quill] May the peace
of God be with you always.

And also with you.


where McCollough's line's at.

You gotta honor your bets,
Vinny.

-[phone beeps]
-[Bobby] Where you going?

I'm looking for a quarter
so I can walk a half mile

to use a payphone,
thank you very much.


John? Wexler?
Yeah, yeah.

Hold the line.

-I'll be off in a minute.
-That's what you said

over an hour ago.

I'd appreciate it
if you'd keep your word.

Appreciate-- Well, honey,
that's a 50-center.

You learned that
at night school?

I'd appreciate
a lot of shit, too.

You're in, you're out,

you're with this one,
you're with that one.

This fucking wedding's
got everybody's head

-screwed right up their asses.
-[sighs]

Tell you something,
look at this place.

It's like a fucking shit house
in distress.

You know, this fucking wedding
has got nothing to do with this.

I'm busy.
I work 48 hours a week.

It's what's known
as a J-O-B.

Oh. Are we gonna go
over that again?

God forbid.
What'll Mrs. Grundy think?

Let me tell you
something, Vikki.

Regardless of what you think,

there's nothing wrong
with what I do.

-Aha.
-I book a few horses,

I write a few bets

and I cover football
each week.

The big crime in that, honey,
I'm missing.

Sitting judges bet the pros.

Little old ladies
in church hats

with flowers on them,
they play the ponies.

A nice little Irish priest,
they still got their brogues,

they bet the dogs.

-Honey, even the pope plays--
-All right.

No, he does, seriously.

Honey, I hear he doubles up
on Christmas.

You're gonna wind up
in jail, Bob.

that's a fucking joke.

They can't even put murderers
in jail.

No, the fucking judges
are too busy

shaking down the lawyers.

Vikki. Vikki!
Goddamn it.

Yeah, John, I'm back.

something, Whitey.

I'm not a random creature.

I love money...

I love pussy.

I love having
a home field advantage.

Been coming up here
about 30 years

and every time I turn around,

someone's looking
to get over on me

like I'm a fat bag of popcorn.

Look, I hold a note
on this bar.

And as good as your old man was,
he lost it fair and square.

And the arithmetic
that you agreed on

to get it back is all fucked up.

I'm behind, that's a fact.

to decide on your own.

You don't call shots on check.
The fuck is wrong with you?

If you're a tough guy,
nobody told me.

I'm just trying to get by.

I'm trying to get out
from under.

The business is slow,
my sister's getting married.

Maybe you should grab a boost
from that enterprising

young friend of yours, Bobby.

Mr. Badass has just about
hung out his shingle.

Someone should tell that kid

his fucking head's
screwed on crooked.

Look, people still
come here, right?

Uh-hmm.

You got customers,
they grab a beer,

they read the Funnies.

Pick a horse...

It seems to me you got more
opportunity at meeting people,

customers, than, say,
a guy like me.

Lay off some of this stuff...

and middle it out.

Probably help with all
this bleeding

you got on your hands.

And help towards some
of the money you owe me...

wouldn't it?

And maybe I wouldn't--
I wouldn't be

as insulted as I am.

Maybe you should call Toby.

He's a fence.

Toby ain't into me
for 12 fucking grand,

Whitey, you are.

Look...

I didn't wanna put it
in your ear like this,

but I'm gonna need about $6,000
of the money you owe me.

Else I'll just bust
his fucking joint out.

Up to you, kid.


[indistinct chatter]

-Four or five?
-Five, five.

-We're gonna get to the--
-[utensils clatter]

Just put that anywhere for now.


Hey, ain't a party
till something is broken, right?


Did my friend and I overhear
you say

you're putting down some gas
line near the old Rockhorn?

Near it? In it.

Who you with, DPA?

Do I look square ass
to you, huh?

No, but Bippy McDuffy
was telling me

that the feds were around,

squeezing the stones
over some lease fees and all.

Bippy McDuffy, huh?

There's a Latin scholar
for you.

Bippy McDuffy?

He's a ten-pound bag of shit
in a five-pound bag.

And you tell him I said so.

Jimmy fucking Christmas,
I'm funning you, you bastards.


Come on!


Bippy and I go back
ten, 15 years.

Asshole buddies.

Where is he?

Hey, you tell him
Billy said hi, all right?

No.

Fuck him.

Don't tell him anything.

He'll be there
this afternoon.


By the quarry.

Off old Samuel Road
where Monument crosses 63

near the mattress factory.

Oh, the old mattress joint.

Yeah. Yeah, my ex-wife
used to work there.

Quality control.

Really?

I'm taking the piss
out of you, you bastard.

Christ.

Hey, but listen, you know...

I'm gonna scoot by there.

You know, if I don't get there
today, probably tomorrow.

Do me a favor.

Don't tell Bippy that I'm
coming. I wanna surprise him.

I ain't seen the fuck
six, five years now.

I wanna have a little fun
with him, all right?

at the munitions plant

until the asshole congressman
lost contracts.

And, uh...

don't need any more cannonballs?

No way, no more.

So, I had an in over here,

so I used my in over here.

My grandfather was a statuer.

He, you know,
carved a lot of these himself.

And this is one of my favorites,
there you go.

-He did that?
-Fucking awesome.

Goddamn work of art right there.

Did that one.

Wow.

And that one.

My God!

Mm-hmm.

So, I don't get it.

Why didn't you follow
in his footsteps?

Uh, he had big feet.


All right, not funny either.
Watch your step.

No, you know,
people gotta spend so much

to see somebody's bones
in the ground these days.

Nobody's got anything left
over for details and stuff.

really, you know...

don't wanna think about it.

you know--

I think a lot of people
don't wanna think

about a lot of shit
these days, you know.

-[Claire] Truby--
-[Truby] Oh, I know, I know.

We talked about this, I know.

Sorry. Oh, wait, hey.

Here it is. He had it in
his will, paid for it himself.

So where you're from,

did they have anything
like this where you're from?

Yeah. Well, I mean,
we moved around a bit.

Your father is an army guy
or something?

No, he was a heart surgeon.

Very professional.

You know, it seems the only
heart he couldn't fix...

was my mother's.

I'm sorry.

So was she.

She killed herself.

Hey...
you should, um...

think about good stuff,
you know.

Think about, you know...

-Can we just go?
-[Truby] Yeah.

-Wanna go?
-Yeah.



It's not your fault the world
doesn't devote itself

to making him happy.

He doesn't wanna hear
the truth anymore

than you wanna tell it
to him.

And if he's ever gonna have
this attack of conscience,

don't you think
he would've had it by now?

It's just...

we shared a lot
of things together.

Including a mattress.

I've heard this all before,

one's standing up,
one's lying down.

Look, he wants you
sitting at home

clipping coupons
and how-to articles,

than going outside
and making a life for yourself.

He's scared of you,

and it's about time you woke up
and saw that.

I did, and I feel great.

You do?

Sometimes.

How do you end something
with somebody after so long?

Ten years.

You decide to.

Decide to. [scoffs]

Vikki, you gotta have
a bigger imagination

than he's got balls.

Baby, you're miserable,

you ought to do
something about it.

Got any twos?


I just--
I couldn't call you before,

there's so much going on.

Oh, all right.

Okay. Why don't you
just call me later?

I know. I love you, too.

I don't know here, John.

Going back...

five, six months here.

Oh. Well, that ain't
so much, Whitey.

Well, I think it's fair enough
to say that it is...

enough.

I mean, you're still getting
your checks, yeah?

None of your goddamn business.

My finance.

Listen, I'm just
a little backed up.

I'm just trying to get out
from under.

I mean, how many times
did I buy you back tonight, huh?

I just thought maybe you could
work with me a little bit

and we could get the numbers
going in the right direction.

I know...

everybody's doing the best
they can.

Rita, what are you doing?

I mean, come back.

Come-- Would you please
come back?

I got one here
with your name on it, okay?

Here, sit down.

John, what are you drinking?

if you could touch me off

with a little of
that Old Grand-Dad.

-[John chuckles]
-[Whitey] Okay.

Forget about this.

[taps glass]

Christ Almighty.

John and Rita
have been drinking here

since before
you were in diapers.

You got no business
putting them through

something like that.

[Whitey sighs]

The road gets rough out there,
Whitey,

and life beats a man down.

It's rare you'll ever win
back some measure

of what it all really means.

They're happy for that.

A gesture.

A good bar brings forth a lot
in people, Whitey.

Opens 'em up.

Hell, you can drink booze
anywhere, but a bar...

that belongs to them.

There's the good thing it does.


-All good.
-You guys take care.

See you next week.

Four-eighty.

Those inspection stickers
I gave you last spring,

-they move out fast enough?
-Hundred miles an hour.

All right. Right, right.

Have a cookie?

Chickie, Chickie, Chickie.


Bought it for ten cents
and a dollar face value.

-This is good shit.
-[Chickie] It's the ink.

It's cured right in the paper.

There's all
the security threads,

all the fibers.

It's the shits, man.

Clean as new money,
all the way from Montreal.

You didn't cook
this up yourself.

No, no, no, no.

Friend of mine named Paris.

Him and his party get them over
at a card game in Pittsburgh.

But that's it
for the month, though.

You don't wanna burn out
the area.

These guys are smart.

You can get 30, 40 points
in those notes and sleep.

It's like selling ice cream
at the beach.

Finally made yourself
a deuce in life, eh, Chick?

[music playing]



Very, very, very unforgiving.

I'm referring to the table,
of course.

Most of them
aren't made here anymore.

All this crap's from Asia now,

India, subcontinent countries.

It's a fucking shame that is.

These balls?

Used to be made out of ivory,

imported then manufactured
stateside.

Now it's all acrylic.

Crap, garbage.

Is that a house stick?

You know, I was watching you
for a few minutes.

You got yourself
a pretty sweet stroke there.

It's fluid.

Keep your elbow tucked in,
where'd you pick that up?

I've been playing all my life,
you know.

Who taught you how to bridge?

Nobody. Myself, I guess.

only louder

so the whole class can hear?

It's a fundamental, kid.

You're doing it all wrong.

There's a day I'd run
a hundred balls for breakfast.

That was a bad day.

Big dollar guy.
Big dollar player.

One pocket, bank pool,

three-time nine-ball
tournament champ

out of Vegas late '70s.

I was so good I'd
spy God in the eight ball.

Then things happened.

Things started to crumble,
you know.

Got so fucking weird
I can hear the fibers bending

as the balls
ran over the felt.


Methamphetamine.

All day, all night.

Fucking cuckoo boo,
thought I was Christ.

Then things started closing in,

I had to quit.

Placed my faith
in higher things.

I think of the money
those motherfuckers

made off my arm.

Wow...

really chaps my ass.


Here I am, pissing
and moaning getting all rummy

on you like a fucking little
Girl Scout.

I didn't catch your name.

Oh. Frankie.

They, uh-- They call me
Frankie Eyelashes.

-You're good-looking.
-[Frankie] Yeah.

You from around here?

Yeah.


You know, shoot for money?

No, no, no.
I'm just killing time.

Good. I don't think
you're looking snazzy

with your ass hanging out
and all.

Can I buy you a drink
in the lounge?


buddy?

I had this cold
since the Preakness,

I can't seem to shake it.

next to a goddamn meat locker.

Draught alone is enough

to knock the fucking hat
off your head.

Thermostat's broke.

But you know me, Bobby.
I bring my own heat.

Nick, I need you to square
a favor with me.

What's the dance?

I need you to sing
at the wedding reception

for Molly Riley
and Jack the Plumber

on the 22nd of the month.

Well, it's out of the question.

That's next weekend.
I got the boat show.

A thousand people
come to see me.

A thousand people
come to see boats, Nick.

They get you, but they come
to see the boats.

Any other weekend's fine.

I'm booked.

For years
I'm in solid over there.

I gave them my word.

Who are you, Pike Bishop
and The Wild Bunch?

Well, who the hell am I gonna
get to cover the date?


Called Abe Moby
at the civic center

and he's gonna book
our stumble-bum friend, uh,

-Cozy Miller.
-Cozy Miller?

The guy can't hold my laundry.

He's church dances,
beef and beer shit.

Besides, Cozy,
he won't do it. Nah...

The money's right,
but it's my crowd.

They'll throw his ass
in the trout pool.

every worm, rat, and snake

in that joint made out
except us.

Why pay a man a living wage?

You can hire a Chinese kid
get out of prison camp

to work his ass off
for nine cents a week.

How do these people
sleep at night?

Don't get it.

My old man...


23 years, call and time.

Do you know he's got the show
for his time on this planet?

What's that?

Limp dick, a lollipop
and two sticks of bubblegum.

Picture of good living, huh?


Now, this is the best thing
to happen to you anyway.

I mean, you could sit
around here all day,

call 'em all the "motherfuckers"
in the world,

and they're still gonna do
the right thing for who?

For them.

What do you mean?

You're playing beneath
your speed, Frankie.

Their game is designed
to let you down,

gives them no greater pleasure.

And for what anyway, huh?
A nowhere's job?

Life without prospects?

Living out your days
like a fucking zombie?

For what,
a little spending cash? Huh?

Let it go.

-Let it fucking go.
-All right.

Count your blessings,
Jesus Christ.

Mm.

What do you want
out of life, anyway?

What would it take for you
to feel...

successful?

Feel like a...

Like a man?

I don't know,
but a lot.

You don't know?

Well, that's as dumb
as dog shit.

"I don't know."

A mentality like that
will get you a good job

driving a peanut truck.

Frankie, you sound like
everybody else.

Like you're stuck between
a shit and a sweat.

Timid, dreaming.
It's all about disappointment,

dashed hopes, hard luck.

Never turning over the coin,
never seeing an opportunity.

Never peeking
at the seeds of triumph.

Frankie, they're there.

For you, for me, for everybody.

They are there.


very long but it's skinny.


to make the same mistake

everybody else has made
when they take the plunge.

Which is what?

Which is disappearing
up your own ass, Jack.

All in the name of love.

You know what a
decision like this means?

Do you know what a handicap
this wedding vow is?

Let's say you're bowling your
ass off at McManus's.

You told Molly you'd be home
by 9:45.

-Fuck it. Fuck it.
-[Truby] Fuck that.

We would say fuck that.

Five hours later, you roll in,
half a nut on,

you're smiling from ear to ear.

Okay, Jack. Her head then...

okay, that's spinning
so fucking fast

she's not gonna know whether
to shit or blow her nose.

You know, and I like Molly,
don't get me wrong, man.


You see, some women
need to be needed, Jack,

and that just can't be,
you know.

You'd be spending
your whole life together,

you know, trying to avoid her
driving you nuts.

Yeah, she'll resort to the whole
circus full of tricks.

She'll say this,
she'll try that,

-blah, blah, blah. Fuck that.
-[Truby] Blah, blah,

blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Jack, just smile...

scratch your ass...

and say, "Honey...

do you remember to put gas
in the fucking car?"

-[laughs]
-"Did you?"

The more shit she pulls,
the more shit you let her.

You just let her.

But it ain't gonna be so bad.
Marriage and all.

Neither's a train wreck
as long as you ain't in it.



Jack!



-Jack is here.
-Yeah, he's back.

Jack is gracing us
with his presence.

-[man] Hey, Jack.
-Spin, Jack.

-[man] That's me boy.
-[Bobby] Spin.


See, Jack?

Who said all the good ones
are taken?


Oh. Gee, Jack.
You need a break, Jack.

Absolutely not, Jack.

-Definitely not, Jack,
-[Truby] One, two, three.

I drink to your good health.


Bobby, I told you
to take him out,

I didn't tell you to kill him.

Frankie. Frankie, get a mirror.

-Put it under his nose.
-[Frankie] All right.

-And then do the other side.
-[Whitey] Jack.

Hey, Whitey, take the cork

out of your ass, all right?
He's having a blast.

You're acting like
I killed a pet.

-Jack.
-[Bobby] It's a party.

So, let's party, goddamn it.


-Oh, great.
-[Truby] Jack.

-You're giving me a headache.
-[Truby] Jack!

Jack!

Jack!

[footsteps approaching]

Bobby, let me tell you
something.

There's a proper way
to conduct business

and this ain't it.

I'm just charging my batteries,
buddy.

I don't trust you anymore.

What's that supposed
to mean, Whitey?

I mean, what the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

You've always been a tolerant,
decent guy, right?

And where the fuck's
it gotten you?

And don't worry about me, buddy.

I'm the only guy in the world
who knows

what the fuck he's doing.

with your chin

on this Joe situation.

The guy is like
a fucking cancer.

Did you know that?

Remember what happened
to my daddy?

I remember.

But he's giving me the elbow.
Big deal.

He's a fucking heavy-hitter.
He's a fucking jerk-off.

Started with the jukebox,
a candy machine

and a quarter pool table.

You don't think I know
who the fuck

I'm playing chicken with?

He ain't crowding you, is he?

Because if he is,
I'll lump the motherfucker.

I wish you would.

Fucking guy needs a beating,
I'm telling you.

Look, I'm just
raising his hand a little.

Nothing to worry about.

Says you.

[machine rattles]

If I, uh...

If I roll this thing on,

can I-- Can I then
go fuck myself?


Whatever makes you happy.


Just a thought.

-Whitey.
-Where have you been all night?

We've been waiting for you
for a long time, for God's sake?

Well, Jack was busy.

Yeah, I can see that.

So I'm set up with Cozy, right?

I got to be honest
with you, Whitey.

I'm allergic to the whole idea

of this bastard
singing anywhere,

let alone a wedding I'm at.

This guy's got crowds
around him?

Damn. [scoffs]

If Molly were my sister,

and I was shopping
for a night of music,

Cozy would be my first mistake.

You can't dance to Cozy Miller.

We shouldn't even be having
this conversation.

I mean, you know how I feel.

[man grunts]

Go play with the girl.

Yes.

Altar boy, altar boy.

That brings back time,
doesn't it?



It sounds like
you dropped out, man.

No. It's just some things
are going on I don't--

Need some distance,
some distance.

I didn't do right by people.

You know?

I didn't do right
by Molly at all.

I ain't proud of it.

Just the way it went down.

I just figured I'd call,
you know,

if I have some good news.

Never did.

Sorry if I let you guys
down, you know.

So, everybody all right?

Well, other than that,
Mr. Lincoln,

how'd you like to play?


What do you mean all right, huh?

You know, some things are good,

some things are bad. You know...

Some things are different,
you know.

are real different.

Molly?

You mean getting-married-
next-weekend Molly?


She...

I don't wanna say there's
a price on your head,

because nobody knows your back,
but there's a lot of people

who might
feel a whole lot better

if you made yourself scarce
for the time being?

Who is she marrying?

Jack Ryan.


Wow.

Wow.

Wow.

Jack Ryan...

-Well, he's a nice guy.
-Yeah.

-He a plumber?
-Yeah.

-He's a plumber, right?
-Right.

-He's a plumber.
-Yeah.

We're standing in with him.

Me and Bobby,
Frankie and Whitey.

You know, he's...

He loves her, Teddy,
you know?

Yeah, I know, cool it.

He's a stand-up guy.
He's banging.

And Whitey?

He's coming down hard, Teddy.

Pulling out like that and all...

You know how he is.

-He's still behind the stick?
-Yeah. Yeah.

Florentine's still
creeping along.

Still breathing.

-You seeing anyone?
-[gasps]

You seeing anyone?

-Teddy, this--
-Are you seeing anyone?

This-- This--

This girl. You have to see--
Wait. Just wait.

She is...

-She is a doll.
-Really?

This girl could make you
wanna run home

-and shoot your whole family.
-Oh, really?

-This girl... bang!
-That's good.

She's-- Teddy,
she's pretty, you know.

She's-- Hold this one sec.

She's pretty,
you know what I mean?

She-- Any girl in any magazine,
forget it.

It doesn't come close.

If you've seen her,
you'll hear music in your head.

It's what I hear, church music.
More church music.

So, how long this been going on?

Oh, you know, it's...
Quite some time. Yeah.

-That's good.
-Yeah.

You wanna stay?

Um, you know,
what are you doing right now?

You wanna come with me?

I'm taking--
I'm supposed to meet her.

I'm not doing nothing.

Come on,
she works at Needleman's

-Right? Yeah.
-Okay.

Where the fuck you've been gone?

Needleman's which is now Dina's,
right?

The old Jew died
of fucking throat cancer.


came in, took over.

They're shitting in his grave,
what these people did.

I know this because I work
in the cemetery.

Well obviously doing things
your own way

ain't exactly worked out
for me, has it?

You know who you are, Pretty?

You're a guy that owes me money.

That's crook in the house,
Bobby.

You're buying dollars,
it's washing money.

And more importantly,
it takes my foot

completely out of your ass.

Pick the groundman'â€™s, right?

Thursday night.

Joe's got a bunch
of tables there,

he runs some heavy dice action.

When you go in,
don't go in double-fisted,

just relax, have a few drinks,
enjoy yourself.

And then, slowly,
slowly load the wagons.

You're gonna get even on this.
It's a good deal for you.

Trust me, all right?

All right.
I know I can count on you.

as everyone said you did?

No.

Harder.

What happened that you're out
of the game?

It's a long story.

Your eye, right? Your retina?


Be careful, Pretty.

You can see everything
in a man's eyes.

for something, Frankie,

you know where you
normally find it?

Right in front of you?

[Billy chuckles]

Hundred years of tradition.

I'm hampered by progress.

Louisiana tail meat.

Small scale cray fish market.


-Cajun popcorn?
-Uh-uh.

Crawdads?

An eighth and a quarter a pound,
without that tariff,

those Jap trawlers
can't compete.

We're priced to move.
This ship? Hotter than summer.

In less than two years,

every kid in America
is gonna be eating it

like French fries.

Wall Street Journal
calls it paycheck of the future.

All this and without
getting your shirt dirty.

Hey, Phil!

Say hi to Carol for me.

I'm godfather to both
of his boys.

You know, potatohead looks
over this land,

-he sees a fucking sinkhole.
-Yeah?

That's why he stays
a clown ass all his life.

What we're talking about here,
it's pure.

It's flawless.
Immutable.

And way beyond guys
like you and me.

I'm talking about
three parts, forty acres,

sixty thousand
pounds of fish per yield.

Set up right,
your fish will Saint Pete.

Profits roll in
like water down a hill.

You set the net out
a little farther,

probably talking about
a pond side restaurant,

gift shop,
all sorts of horseshit.

Monkey trick here, Frankie.

So, keep Castro's army here
on the move,

working all the time.

That way, late January,
the pond is stocked

for peak season in June.

Then we double back
in December

and we're in the black.

Problem is
I'm running through money

like Grant through Richmond.


I could ask around.

you're on the balls of your ass.

I know that. It ain't fair.

You going out there,
trying to goose some bread up

for me, you know,
it's dangerous.

Dangerous, man.

I mean, next thing you know,
every mayonnaise-eating

motherfucker and his cousin
will be out here

like a truffle pig
horning in on our action.

I ain't from around
these parts.

I can't afford
another partnership.

I got to keep a lid on this,
tight.

Anyways, I'm only looking
for five, six grand cash, tops,

to push me through.

Ah!

Hey, Frankie, I'll scare it up.

Believe me.

Thanks anyway.

-No problem.
-Appreciate the offer, really.

No, it means a lot to me.

You know, doing turn-away
business as I suspect,

maybe I could use a guy
like you.

Free me up a bit.

You know, I don't wanna
wind you up or nothing,

but if things
work out well for me,

maybe you lucked in
to something good.

Remember.

This stands for something
other than itself.

Oh, Frankie.

Yes!

-You believe any of that shit?
-Like what?

You know, soul mate,
life partner.

you know,

because to me it's all

so hocus-pocus, you know?
Life, especially my life,

it's a roll of the dice,
you know?

Sometimes you win the bear,
sometimes you don't.

-It's true.
-Right?

What, you planning
on settling down?

Well, you know,
can you picture it?

I think I might.

I think I'm gonna--
I'm gonna try, you know.

Have a few kids.
Raise a family.

My family.

Just be patient.

It's got to be a hell
of an undertaking.

Don't you think?


Look at that.
Look at that, huh?

What a beauty.
Here we go.

Come, come, come, come, come.

Look at that, look at--
So beautiful.

Claire, um, I want you to meet--
Uh, this is one of my oldest

and dearest friends,
Teddy Finn.

Teddy Finn, this is Claire.

Now, just do me
one favor, okay?

Whatever you do,
under no circumstances,

do not look
at what is behind Teddy

right on the car,
right behind Ted.

Don't-- Do not look, okay?

-Because you might--
-What are you doing?

Because who knows
what you might...

Oh.


This-- Claire, this is for you.

-Truby, I--
-It's all for you.

-Really, I don't want a gift.
-Oh, no, no.

I want you to have it.
I want you to have it.

Here you go.

-Um...
-So, uh, tear it open.

Hey, that's nice--
Very nice to have met you.

Oh, yeah. That's-- Oh.


You got it? He's got it.

It was really nice
meeting you, too.


Got to go!

I tell you where Billy Clooton's

place was, Whitey.

It was in Brown's Mills.

You walked in there
with a dollar,

you had the world.

And, boy, was he good
with his mitts.

Beat the shit out of Frank
De Brosas one night.

Made quite a few friends
in here when he did.

Never told her I...

knew about him though.

Who's that?


All my years I'd been faithful.

Not so much as look
at another broad.

1953, over on Fern Boulevard,

we lived above Growser's
Pharmaceutical.

Soda shop,
she worked the fountains there.

Used to see 'em strolling
along Superior Avenue,

wanted to tear off
after them,

kick the Italian half to death.

I didn't do it. Lost my nerve.


I'll only admit this to you...
now, Whitey.

Only now.
I thought if I did that,

I'd lose her, okay?

So, I let it go on.

She thought it had to do
with her getting old.

She cried for every new line
across her face.

I tried to tell her,
"You look good to me."

I guess it wasn't enough.

After the Italian
was another guy

and after him
some Hungarian fella.

Plus, I'd gotten pretty well
to drinking

and all by then, so...

Just upped and left.

It wasn't right.


Because I never saw her again.

You know,
I hate to think of her.

Spending her days
like some old whore.

Lying in a filthy bed.

Crying about the one
that slipped away.

All the while, I'm...

clinging to some fake memory
of a beautiful...

beautiful...

28-year-old girl
working the soda fountain.

Making a lime rickey.


Pinkest blouse you ever seen.

I let her down.

you let each other down.



whipped his ass up
in a terrible way.


You should've seen him.


God makes green apples,

you're gonna get all
my fucking money back to me.

-[laughter]
-Got that?

Because I'll fucking
put your lights out, kid.

Yeah. Tell Chubby
the same thing, okay?


[indistinct chatter]

[bowling pins crashing]


My God.


-[Joe] What's up?
-[Frankie] Okay.

Um, you told me once, if I
ever had anything, you know,

that was interesting,
that I should...

Well, I got this thing, right?

And it's, uh, on paper,
it just looks good.

It just looks so good,
it bring tears to your eye.

You wanna put down a move
and you want me

to float you the cash,
right?

Yeah, I don't want you
to lend it to me.

It's just I need to borrow it.

For a couple of days, you know.

For, like, show purposes,
you know?

You just fall out
of your mom's ass?


On this side,
we don't do things like that.

What's the knock down?

What's your end?

Well, uh, it's kind of
hard to say, really.


I like to, kid,

only my business dick says no.

It's the future, Joe.
There's money in it.

Yeah, there's money
in payphones too, Frankie,

only I don't see you
getting any of it.

Shit outta luck, kid.

Sorry, I can't help you.

[tires screech]

The motherfucker fucked us.

You mind telling me
what you're talking about?

funny money, shit money.

There's 87 guys
over at Starbright Vending

and they all want
their money back.

Oh, Daniels gave me that. $280.

He wants it to be turned dollar
for fucking dollar today.

How big did we get hit?

by sundown.

People have been waiting
for this for a long time.

I should've known it
the minute he didn't split aces.

I didn't fucking react.

The boxer?

Pretty little young fuck.

For his life, he couldn't cover
a two-dollar bet.

There's a night
he comes in there

like a nigger
with a hit record.

Doubling down,
betting stacks of blacks.

Had to be him,
who else could it have been?

I'll beat ten motherfuckers.

Isn't this some shit?

Isn't this some fucking shit?

[car engine starts]

That's it?

She just said
she didn't want it?

It was the way she said it.

The way she said it,
like she has no fucking

regard for me.

I did nothing to her
but treat this girl right.

-Nothing.
-I know.

So, maybe you ought to,
you know, let it go.

Let what go?

Her.

What?

She doesn't wanna go out
with you anymore, okay?

She-- You know,
you can't fit a square peg--

-I'm so fucking square?
-Square peg, man.

-What?
-I don't need a kissing lesson,

-okay, Teddy?
-Oh, fuck it.

Truby, calm down, man.

You're getting your balls up
over nothing.

You know,
she ain't the end of the world.

-Jesus Christ.
-How is it that

I've been smothering you,
exactly?

-What?
-Can you tell me that, please?

How is it that I have been
smothering you?

Look, Truby, I can't get
into this right now, okay?


is how have I
been smothering you?

Look, you're a very nice guy.

No, you're such-- You are--
You're such a nice guy,

but I'm sorry
if you misinterpreted anything.

I am not a nice guy.
Do you feel sorry for me?

Is this what this is?
You feel sorry for me?

-[manager] Claire.
-Did I ask...

-[bell rings]
-Claire, pick up.

Look, you're gonna
get me fired, okay?

You know what?
I'm trying to be nice here.

Can you tell him
to shut the fuck up?

-I'll take care of this.
-Oh, you walking away?

You're walking away?

I'm talking to you.
I'm talking to you right here.

We're talking right here.
This is talking.

-[manager] Claire...
-Hey! Asshole!

Fuck you.
Can you not see right here

I am talking to the lady?

You stay there,
you stay there.

-Come on.
-[manager] You stay there.

-Come on, Popeye, come on.
-[manager] You stay there.

-Fuck you, come on.
-You know I won't say

-fuck you, man.
-Oh, yes.

-You never say "fuck" to me!
-Fuck you, you-- Fuck you!

-[apron tears]
-Never say "fuck" to me!

-[Claire shouting indistinctly]
-Motherfucker!

-[Truby] This is America, pal!
-I don't need any of you.

I'm a fucking American!

Okay, calm down.
Truby, come on, man.

Come on.


Calm down.


-You got that?
-Calm down.

-Truby?
-[door opens, closes]

Hey, Truby!

Son of a bitch...

-He's your friend?
-Yeah.

-He's crazy.
-Everybody's crazy.

You're crazy, too.

It's over.

It's over. The fight's over.

Yeah, well,
I don't even know

why I'm taking a bet
this small, Phil.

All right. If we're doing
the points, I'll add.

[phone beeps]

Vikki, did Phil call here
for me today?

You were out getting a six pack.

What are you doing?

I'm gonna be staying
with my sister, Bonnie,

and her kids for a few weeks.

There's just a few things
I need to work out.

Wait a minute. What--

Relax, I mean...

Look, Connie, I know
we've been under the gun lately,

you know, it's just, uh,

we've gotta get through
this bullshit

and we'll be able to live
like people again.

That's all.

Bobby, I don't really even know
who we are anymore.

Or who we ever were
for that matter.

On Saturday,
Molly's gonna stand up

on that altar
and she's gonna promise

to love Jack
for the rest of her life.

And I think...

I'd like to be able
to do that myself one day.

It's just a whole lot of things
going on, that's all.

Like what?


Like...

Like when I think back
and I remember how hard

my mother worked

and struggled to raise six kids
without a husband.

And now that nobody's
on drugs or in jail, I think

how hard and tough that must
have been for her, you know?

To lead a decent life...
And she did it.

We did it.

I'm better than this, Bobby.

And I thought you were too.

And I'm not
walking away from you,

I'm just not gonna walk away
from myself anymore.

-Vikki, I just think--
-No. Don't say a word.

And let's keep this a secret
until after the wedding, okay?

We had our dance.

Now, let Jack and Molly
have theirs.


[Vikki cries]

[indistinct chatter]

[music playing]

You still there?

[clears throat]

Luke still going out
with Laura?

Oh, they broke up?

That's sad.
They seemed so tight.

Look, I'm really sorry
about today.

You know, thanks for, you know,

helping me out
and stuff, you know.

Oh, no big deal.

Are you all right?


Fine.

I used to be fine too, you know.

Fucked up, insecure,
neurotic and empty.


being fine, though.

No?
So, you're not anymore?

Hey, you know,
you look okay to me.

-[Teddy] Really?
-Mm-hmm.

You ought to see me in my cape.

You ought to see me
in my glass slippers.

Oh, I'd like to.

-So, about Truby--
-[Claire] Hey.

Hey, I know he's your friend
and everything.

I know, I know, um,
he overrates things.

He's a great guy, though.

He's one of the greatest guys
that ever walked

the face of the earth,
you know,

he just hasn't walked
very far on it.

Well, those simple guys
who don't have

all those simple answers but...

it's part of their charm,
though, I guess.

I guess so.

It's the whacked dudes like us

that keep the world
all screwed up.

[both laugh]

No, trust me, man.
It's over with her.

She'll never see me again.

She really blew a gasket on you,
huh?

Mm-hmm.

Does she have
a forwarding address?

But you got her
phone number, right?

Do you know her last name?

Yeah, I can, um...

I can see how you'd be
all broke up about that.

You'll be all right.

What are you doing?

I'm making a list of my enemies.

I could be here
for quite some time.

-Hey, Frankie?
-Mm?

Put this in the safe for me,
will you?

Watch it.

-[thud]
-Oh... [sighs]

knock some sense into you.

Hey, Whitey, you, uh...
You know about that?

That's the, uh,
balance for the caterer.

For Gumbrowski,
for the wedding.

I got to drop it off.

Oh, shit.
I'm going out there tomorrow.

I can take it out,
I'm getting my brakes done,

it's just across the street.

-[Whitey] Your brakes went out?
-Yeah.

No, that's a lot of money.
I'll take it myself.

What? You're gonna go
30 minutes out of your way

when I'll already be there?
Come on.

Well, that's, uh,
four big ones in there, Frankie.

You know
what you're doing, yeah?

Yeah.


Okey-doke.

That's done.



I was just--
I was just thinking that

you should...
You should, you know,

I think you should probably
know something.

You think
I should know something?

Yeah.

Everything's, you know--
It's no big deal.

Everything's...

just cool beans and...

Well, what the hell
is it, all right?

Spit it out.

It's Teddy Finn.

Teddy Finn is back in town.

He's at the church,
but, you know, everything's...

Everything's cool.

[clears throat]
He's at the church.

I got a cousin near Butler...

so maybe I'll bus down there.

I'm-- Actually,
I'm thinking Saturday now.

I really do wanna...

wish you the best of luck,
Claire, because it...

really is a long waltz,

no matter who it is
you're dancing with.

It took me a long time to
find out the tail I was chasing

wasn't really attached to a dog.

It wasn't really attached
to anything.


Um, they're expecting
sleet tonight.

I got to get up early.

I got to salt the walk
for the parishioners.

To keep them happy. You know.

Got to-- Got to serve
somebody, I guess.

So, um, if you, uh, you know,
wanna give me a call, um,

over there before you leave.
I don't know.

You know,
maybe get a cup of coffee.

That is, if you know
some place that serves coffee.


Look, I got to split.
[clears throat]

[door opens]

Hey there, Teddy.

Hey, Whitey.

She's, uh...

moved on with things
and, uh...

I hope you're gonna
respect that.

We were good altar boys once.

Yeah, once upon a time.

You know...

the night before I left,
I was over at your house,

I was, uh...

I was sitting on that...

couch glider you got out front.


I flicked down that AM radio
of yours.

Steam here, it was blowin'.

And, um...

I had your sister's hand...

in mine...

Saw my future that night.

Whitey, I didn't
come back here to...

you know, win your respect...

because of what I've been
through on my time on the road,

because it was bullshit.

But I'd appreciate it
if I don't have to fall on

anyone's spear...

to do the things I got to do.

Just like any decent man,
I just wanna...

do what's right.

Get on with things.

And I thought that...

you-- you'd understand that.

[slaps hand]

It's kind of funny you and me
winding up back

in a church, huh?

I'm gonna call down
a blessing for you.

-Yeah, I could use it.
-[chuckles]

Thanks a lot.

I'll be seeing you around.

You'll be seeing me around.

the same serial number

but they've been
spending real nice.

Particularly at the colleges,
bookstores and shit.

The only problem is,
the motherfucker I get it from

works about
as much as Santa Claus.

So, the next batch I get in,
I got to get 20 points on.

-Too heavy for you?
-No.

Chickie said you used to box.


some troubles.

Kid named Carpenter.

Why'd you quit?

I didn't quit.
I got knocked out.

Marysville, Ohio.

I had the kid out on his feet.

He was all opened up.
He didn't even know

what state he was in.

You couldn't put him away?

He was away.
What do you got,

shit in your ears?


But, uh...

I lost respect, you know,
I got caught.

Woke up in the eye hospital.

Wait till you hear what happened
to the other guy.

You knew him?

Kenny Carpenter,
from Dayton,

tattoos up
his fucking arms?

That's the guy.

Everybody had a piece
of that motherfucker.

Kenny never had much sense,
but he had too much sense

to take that kind of shit.

Wanted to go his own way
so they fucked him.

Yanked his license,
full amount.

Where is he at now?

He's dead.


Got his brains blown out
trying to take off

some tip-and-touch outside
of Cleveland.

Off-duty cop.
That's going back

four, five years now, huh?

Heard he was on the pipe
pretty good, too,

so I guess it was expected.

Hey, Mills,
your turn to tell a sad story.

Yeah, here's my sad story.


I need any more of that stuff,
I'll get in touch

with you through Chickie.

And remember,
20 points on the next batch.

I got steroids
if you need them, too!

Bootleg!


Hey, angel eyes.

Hey, why don't you fix ol',
uh, Billy boy here,

uh, some spaghetti,

little coffee,
and give me a little sliver

of that layer cake over there.

And fix my uncle over here

a malted and, uh,
bowl of macaronis.

[music playing]

What the hell get you
so out of breath,

you couldn't wait till Monday?

All right, look,
I know you're busy

and everything and, you know,

because you been out there
covering yourself,

getting your dough together
and all that,

I just-- You know,
I wanted to show you

what a guy like me
will be willing to do

for a guy like you, you know,
in the pitch.


"Let him who seeks
continue to seek

until he finds.

And when he finds,
he will become troubled.

And when he becomes troubled,
he will become astonished."

Gospel according
to Saint Thomas.


Man, I had you all wrong, kid.

You know,
this is gonna come back to you,

big time.

You count on that, okay?


Man, Frankie.

Look at that stupid
son of a bitch,

left his parking lights on.

I'm gonna go tell him.

I'll be right back.

â™ª You've got me goin'â™ª

â™ª Well, I guess you knowâ™ª

â™ª Well, if it's not showin' â™ª

â™ª Well, I love you so â™ª

â™ª There's no resistin' â™ª

â™ª All your sweet kissin' â™ª

â™ª And now I'm givin' up â™ª

â™ª Oh yeah, I'm giving upâ™ª

â™ª My heart and soul to you â™ª

[tires screeching]

Oh.


Look at that. [chuckles]

You know, if you were a woman,
I'd kiss you right now.


You don't happen to have
anything that don't belong

to you now, do you?

Now keep your hands
where I can see 'em, clown.

Pull off the road.

Now put everything back
just the way you found it.

Put it back.

And slide it back to me.

I'll shoot you.

You don't think I will?

I'll shoot you, man.


Okay, I'm gonna leave now,

and you're gonna leave.

And we're never gonna see
each other again, okay?

Okay?

But if you got a dumb idea
of coming back on me,

I'm gonna get an equally
dumb idea.

And I'm gonna blow big holes
in your head.

Okay?

Okay?

Cool, cowboy.

Didn't see it coming.

Did not see it coming.

Very nice.

Let's go.

[car engine starts]

"Cowboy." What an asshole.

my mother's dress?

-[laughs]
-[doorbell rings]

No, the only thing
that was missing was two buttons

and I found them. Yes.

Wait, hang on a second.

Teddy.

Molly.

Uh, I gotta--
uh, I gotta call you back.

Okay, bye.

[door closes]

Hey.

Oh, my God, Teddy.


Still overdressing, huh?

I don't know what to say.

Oh, I already know. I heard.

-You're getting married.
-Yeah.

Yeah. Whole town's talkin'.

Jack Ryan?



Can't think of
a more deserving guy.

Hey look, um...
[clears throat]

I feel like an asshole, okay?

But I'd feel like
a bigger asshole...

you know, if I didn't tell you
a few things.

I was afraid of, um...

What?

I could never
have made you happy.

I couldn't make myself happy,
how could I make you happy?

I couldn't...

And, um, I didn't have the guts
to tell you then, so...

I'm sorry.

Oh well...

I mean, I guess things have a
way of working out in the end.

Yeah.

Listen, thanks...

Thanks for coming by.

And, uh, I'll see you down
the road.

Christ, um...

don't talk about the road.

Um, I got you something, so...

Um, consider it your first
wedding present.

[clears throat]

It's kept me good company
over years.

I'm sure it can do the same
for you.

It's beautiful, Teddy.

Thank you.

I gotta go.

[door closes]

[siren wailing]

[men shouting indistinctly]

to my fucking face!

You wanna tell me to relax?

How the fuck are you telling me
to relax?

Look at your face,
look at my fucking face!

[all speaking indistinctly]

[Pretty screams]

["Dam" by Kacey Chambers
playing]

Fucking face!
I'll kill that motherfucker.

[continues shouting
indistinctly]

â™ª Do you think â™ª

â™ª That you've come far â™ª

â™ª Through winds so hardâ™ª

â™ª And are you
as disgruntled â™ª

â™ª As you appear â™ª

â™ª Are you wishing
I wasn't here â™ª

â™ª Well, one day soon
That dam is gonna break â™ª

â™ª It'll wash you away â™ª

â™ª It'll wash you away â™ª

â™ª Yeah, one day soon
That dam is gonna break â™ª

â™ª And it'll wash you away â™ª

â™ª It'll wash you away â™ª

â™ª From me â™ª

Hey, Molly.

What are you doing here?

I can't sleep.

Oh...

Can I, uh--
Can I get you something?

No.

I just wanted to be here.

I guess you got a kind of
big day tomorrow, huh?

Yeah. It's a big day
for everybody.

Yeah, well,
I'm gonna miss you, kid.

Just gonna be
down the block, Whitey.

Yeah, well...

When people get married...
sometimes...

just down the block and,
uh, it seems like

on the other side of the Earth.

I, uh-- I never told you
this before but, uh,

you know, after Dad died, uh...

I don't really think that

I could've made it without you.

I mean, can't you just see him
right now...

pacing back and forth
over there...

[mutters, laughs]

...with a Lucky Strike
hanging out of his mouth?

Oh, my God. He'd be going on
about the wedding,

and probably, uh, telling me
to get married.

Giving me that big speech
about how one day

everything's gonna be mine.

And, uh, I, uh...

I miss him.

And sometimes when I'm in here
at night and by myself and...

I swear, I can hear him
speaking to me.

What's he saying now?

He's telling me to...

take care of my baby sister.

Take care of your people.

If there's one right thing...

that I ever do

in this lifetime,

it'll be that.

You're making me cry.

-[laughs]
-Sorry.

I just thought, uh, it'd be just
the right time to say it.

I'll always be there for you,
Whitey.

You gonna be holding
my hand tomorrow?

Until that drunken plumber
takes it away.


He's not.

-He loves me.
-Yeah, I know he does.

I love you, Mol.

I love you, too, Whitey.

I'm gonna sweep up
and, uh...

You can hang around
if you want, all right?

-Yeah.
-I'll, uh...

I'm gonna finish up around here.

Good luck tomorrow.

It's gonna be good.

â™ª It's the morning
I have lived my life for â™ª

â™ª Waking up and looking
In your eyes â™ª

â™ª And I know that you â™ª

â™ª Feel the way I do â™ª

â™ª I'm not sure
That I believe my eyes â™ª

I didn't know
he was lying to me.

One minute we're talkin',
everything's great,

I'm seeing my future, you know.

And it's looking good,
it's looking pretty good

and then I look up
and he's like this

and then like that,
and all I'm seeing

is brake lights.

And that's the truth.

Well, that is, without a doubt,

one of the greatest fish stories
I've ever heard.

You see this?

That's an imaginary tear
running down my cheek.

I've heard enough goat shit
in my day to fill up Lake Erie.

I didn't bread pork chops
for 27 years

to get barreled by some punk
like you.

You got sandbagged? Shanked?
Tough shit.

It means nothing to me.

If I don't have the money, cash,
in hand in ten minutes,

I'm pulling the plug
on the Dago

and personally throw each
and every last one of you

deadbeat motherfuckers
out of here.

â™ª I can't remember whenâ™ª

â™ª This was a dream
We share forever... â™ª

Sorry it had to be
like this, buddy,

but I had a reputation
to protect.

What are you sorry about?

Well, you know, Nicky.

Are you kiddin' me?
He's the best.

That guy's the greatest.

I mean,
I'm surprised we got him,

working the boat show and all.

Things worked out good.

Fucking guy's
better than Frankie Valli.

-Know what, Whitey?
-What?

You look sharp.

Thanks, Bobby.
So do you.

I love you, buddy.

Oh, what do you want?

-Hey, hey, hey.
-What do you want?

I'm getting the old glad eye.

Oh, yeah?
Who?

It's a layup. Skeeter's cousin,
you know, the blonde from...

wherever she's from,
Philly or something?

Uh-huh, uh-huh.

-She sharp? What's her name?
-Oh, yeah.

-Nancy something or other.
-Nancy something or other?

-Nancy whatever...
-That's an interesting name.

What are you gonna go?

Well, she's in the john,
she's getting dolled up,

she's getting ready,
here I am.

Easy, Suave, okay?
Got a little advice for you.

Take your time,
try to be friends with her.

-I'm fine, I'm-- I'm--
-"I'm-- I'm--"

Just... learn her last name.

Yeah.

Right?

All right, I'll do that.

-I'll do that.
-Good.

-Hey
-Yeah?

She wants the same things
out of life you do, buddy.

Trust me.

-All right?
-All right.

Go get her.

Just testin'.
Ah, almost got you.

-Would you look at that?
-Yeah.


â™ª Right here by my side... â™ª

on Hail Marys this week.


You know, Frankie,

in all the years
I've watched you boys grow up,

all the battles you've been in,

I'm amazed at the one truth
you all keep returning to.

Which is what?

That there's not a question
in this life that you can ask

that God isn't already
the answer to.

You wanna bet?
[clears throat]

Denying your faith?

Give it a shot.

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

That's it.

Act in full faith
and with purpose,

that you will receive
this blessing.

And give thanks to Almighty God
for this wonderful gift,

no matter how unworthy
your soul may be. Amen.

It works when you want it to.

So, uh, Sandy Mugridge?

-Sandy Mugridge?
-Yeah.

-Okay. Sandy Mugridge.
-Truby...

Just Truby, just--
that's what my friends call me,

all right? Both of them.


Whitey, I got something
for you here.

Slightly over 11 grand there.

Whitey, the day
your father died,

I never told anyone this,

there were two things
in his side pocket.

A racing form,
with Sly Cindy

circled in the fourth,
with chalk,

and $320 cash.

You wanna know
the name of the horse

that came across first,

in the fourth race that day?

Sly Cindy?

No.

Bald Cat.

The long shot.


Somethin' your old man
would never have done.

I had a hunch,
so I called it in.

Marty Daley's outfit
took the action,

damn near broke him.

Took him three weeks
to pay me off.


Had it all sittin' aside
for you ever since.

Why'd you wait so long
to pass it on?

Whitey.

And with life being so short,

and me being so thirsty,

ain't no sense in going into it.

I think today I'm truly blessed.

And, uh, so are you.

â™ª People like you â™ª

â™ª People like me â™ª

â™ª We build our lives â™ª

â™ª Around a dream of fantasy â™ª

â™ª What do we know?â™ª

â™ª What do we feel? â™ª

â™ª How will we ever know â™ª

Can I get you another drink?

No, I'm fine.

Thanks.

[piano music playing]

How's things over at Bonnie's?






Hey, Jack.

Can I talk to Jack a second?

-All right.
-I haven't done anything yet.

You're a very lucky man today.

Thank you.

Here.

What's this?

Holy shit.

Take care of her.

I will. Uh, of course I will.

-Okay.
-Thanks, man.

All right.

Thanks, Whitey.

Vikki.

I'm gonna be taking
some time off,

putting some things behind me.

Like what?

Like a lot of things.

Ways of life.

Things I've been doing.
Things I never should've done.

I haven't had a lot of time
to thinks about this, but...

I know you don't get many
chances in life...

like us.

Bobby, don't do this.

Not now, okay?

I have to do this now, Vikki.

I know I love you,
and I think you still love me.

And...

And, uh...

I know I got a lot wrong
with me. I do.

But it's nothing
that what's right can't fix.


Vick.

I wanna learn to be
your friend again.


Bobby.

Bobby, Bobby.

[woman laughs]


-Yeah.
-[mutters indistinctly]

[clears throat]


[laughter, indistinct chatter]


Goodbye.

[indistinct chatter]

with your dress...

Truby, come on,
you're killing me! Hey!

That's a brand new suit, man!

[man laughs]


Be good to her!

Good luck!

[bird chirping]

[horn honking]

a bar is a place

where people to come together,

to share things,

to be thankful,

to know that they're not alone.

And I guess it's this everyday
grace of ordinary people

that'll sustain us for now.

[laughter, indistinct chatter]

We've awakened to the fact
that we're not young anymore.

And perhaps our future
is no longer limitless.

But was it ever?

Tonight,

in this tightly-defined
little corner of the world,

the lights of my father's
bar burn bright,

because we've come to learn what he must've known all along.

And that is that life's
not always about

holding good cards.

It's about playing well
with the ones you've got.

â™ª Well, I sought gold â™ª

â™ª And diamond rings â™ª

â™ª My own drug
Ease the pain â™ª

â™ª That living brings â™ª

â™ª Walked from the mountain â™ª

â™ª To the valley floor â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª From a house on a hill â™ª

â™ª A sacred light shines â™ª

â™ª I walk through these roomsâ™ª

â™ª But none of them are mine â™ª

â™ª Down empty hallways â™ª

â™ª I went from door to door â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Well, your hair
Shone in the sun â™ª

â™ª I was so high â™ª

â™ª I was the lucky one â™ª

â™ª Then I came crashing down â™ª

â™ª Like a drunk
On a barroom floor â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Tonight I can feel
The cold wind at my back â™ª

â™ª I'm flyin' high
Over gray fields â™ª

â™ª My feathers
Long and black â™ª

â™ª Down along the river's
Silent edge I soar â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª

â™ª Searching
For my beautiful reward â™ª
