[crickets chirping]

[fire crackling]

[fabric rustling]

[gentle orchestral music]

[fabric rustling]

Ugh.

[gentle orchestral music]

[fabric rustling]

[gentle footsteps]

I didn't hear you get up.

[gentle music]

I'll make some coffee.

[gentle music]

[rustling footsteps]

[backpack rustling]

[gentle music]

[crunching footsteps]

[ominous music]

[crunching footsteps]

Fuck.

[gravel crunching]

[insects buzzing]


[heartbeat pounding]
[ominous music]

[crickets chirping]

Live in the present.

Life is a great adventure.

[car passing]

Hm.
What?

Fortune cookie.

Cute.

[muffled shouting on television]

Why are we staying here?

We're living the adventure.

Can this adventure be
a, a little less stained?

This is all that was vacant.

I thought you didn't
want it all mapped out.

Yeah, I know.

But at our next stop could we

at least eat at the restaurant?

Are we gonna stay cooped up in

crappy motels rooms all the way there?

That wasn't the point of all this.

It's 10 o'clock at
night on our first night.

[carton thumping]

And look, Game of Thrones is on.

At least we have HBO.

[muffled shouting on television]


Hey.


We'll have our adventure, I promise.

[muffled shouting on television]

[fabric rustling]

Oh, I saw a pamphlet at the check-in Desk.

The world's largest ball of twine,

it's just off the interstate.

We could hit it up before lunchtime.

Why do you have to tease?

Relax love, it's just the beginning.

[muffled shouting on television]

We're really doing this?
Yeah.




Tell me again when we're
going to do in Denver.

You just can't get away from
planning anything, can you?



Butt head.

I assume we'd find
a place and settle in.

There's some awesome condos overlooking

the west side of the city,
the foot of the Rockies.

I've never seen the Rockies before.

Let's go up 'em.

[peaceful music]

Isn't it cold?
Yeah, it can be.

Cold won't get you.

[peaceful music]

That sky, though?


[peaceful music]


The colors, the light.

You'd think nothing so
beautiful could be so real.


[peaceful music]

[birds chirping]

[phone vibrating]

[tense music]

[light tapping]

[hair rustling]

[light tapping]

C'mon.

[hair rustling]

[phone vibrating]

[quiet sighing]

[ominous music]

[hair rustling]

[tense music]

[curtains sliding]

[fabric rustling]

Trent.

Hey.

I've got a headache.

I'm just looking for the keys.

Is there any Advil in the car?

Yeah, Center console.

Hurry up, come back to bed.

Yeah, yeah, okay.

[door opening]

[door shutting]

[tense music]

[phone vibrating]

[light tapping]

What the fuck?

[dramatic music]

No.

[phone vibrating]

Mm-mm.

[tense music]

[light tapping]

[phone vibrating]

[light tapping]

[tense music]

[keys jingling]

[car door opening]


[gun chamber opening]

[gun chamber closing]

[phone vibrating]

[tense music]


[muffled crying]

[phone vibrating]

[door closing]

What the hell are you doing?

[fabric rustling]

Trent.
Get your things.

It's after three in the morning.

What's going on?

Please stop asking
questions and grab your stuff.

You're skimming with me.

What is it?

Is that a gun?

Why do you have a gun?
Yes,

now get the fuck out of bed.

Please do what I say.

Just grab your things.

We're going.

[fabric rustling]

You'd better explain
to me what's going on.

We're not safe.

What did you do?

I didn't do anything.

I mean, do you trust me?

I don't know, you have a fucking gun.

If you get your things,

I will tell you everything in the car.

I'm not going anywhere with
you until I get some answers.

Okay.

Maybe I haven't been completely honest.

My line of work isn't really

legal.
Drugs?

No.

Did you kill someone?
Good God, no.

Then what is it?

I can't tell you exactly.
Why?

Why, Trent?
Because if you knew,

then they would be after you, too.

The less you know, the better.

Too.

Trent, stop hinting around
it, tell me what is...

No, see, if I tell you anything...

This is why we're going
to Denver, isn't it?

Not exactly.

You've been running.

This trip.

How can you be so selfish?

Masking this dream we have

as an alibi for your problem.

I'm sorry things have
gotten complicated,

but my life is messy, Ali.

I know you can't understand
that, but this, this trip, this,

this trip, it'll change
everything, it'll fix it.

[heavy breathing]

Denver is still our future
and that hasn't ever changed,

not even with what you know now.

I am scared, Alison.

I don't want to lose you

and I don't want to do this without you.

[tense music]

These people,

do they know who I am?

[tense music]

I don't, I don't think so.

You don't think so?

This is our lives, Trent.

Which, that, which is
why we have to go now.

It's the only way.

I'm going ahead of you.
What?

Why would you do...
Trent,

if we are going to get to
Denver, we need to be safe.

This way, it protects both of us.

I can protect us.
Can you?

Here.

[gun cocking]

Take this.
No, I don't want this.

I've never touched a gun before.

Just please take this, in case.

It would make me feel better.

How are you going to stay protected?

I'll be careful.

Here, this, this should be enough.

Rent a car, ditch ours,
they'll be looking for it.

Don't talk to anyone and make
as few stops as possible.

Get food and bathroom breaks in

only when you fill up for gas.

How are you going to get there?

Don't worry about me.

I'm good at thinking on my feet.

I will be there.

Oh, no cell phones either.

Another way they'll be able to find us.


How do I get ahold of you?

You won't.

Just trust.

There's a diner off of Colfax Avenue.

I'll be waiting for you
in the booth in the back

at 11:15 am sharp two days from now, okay?

Hey.

Hey hey, that mountaintop.

Love, we gotta climb if
we're gonna see that sky.

[hopeful music]

I love you, girly.

I love you, too.

[heavy breathing]


[door opening]

[crickets chirping]
[tense music]

[birds chirping]

[water trickling]


No.






Just you and me, just you and me.

I'm sorry, oh God...


Color looks beautiful on you.




Fuck.


Henry, you wanna get in on this?


Excuse him.

Who needs you?


[rustling footsteps]



Now just let it out, yeah.

Oh, give me a shower.

Don't spit on me, piece of shit.


That's not looking too
good, I'll make it better.


Oh.

You done good, man, you done good.

Woo!

Ah, yeah.


Hey oh.

You want a cigarette?

Nah, you don't smoke.

[birds tweeting]

What's your deal, man?

Think I got a piece of
bone stuck in my knuckle.

Got anything I can clean
this shit off with?

[keys rattling]

There's a towel in the back.

[car door opening]

[car door closing]

Don't get any of it on the car.

Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

Why do you always have to
make such a fucking mess?

Because I like to have fun.

You know, if I'm going to fucking work,

I'm gonna have some fun doing it.

A mess just means more work.

You're just fucking nuts.

Yeah.

Yeah, maybe I am.
Sloppy.

So, what's next?

What do you mean, "What's next?"

Bury the damn body.

Fuck you.

I cooked dinner, you do the dishes.

Why do you always turn
this into a circus act?

If they wanted a beating,
they would have asked for one.

They wanted this one dead.

Taking 20 minutes out of our morning

to turn his face into hamburger

doesn't make him any more
dead, it just makes a mess.

You risked breaking your hand
over one lousy little job.

That's what bullets are
for, you fucking moron.

Goddamn bull in a China shop.


[car door opening]

[car door closing]

You know, I'm retiring soon.

saying that for a while now.

No, it's happening.

I'm done, I'm getting off this ride.

[bird tweeting]

You think there's some sort of

pension check waiting for you?

Sorry to inform you, man,

but there wasn't a 401k
when you signed up.

They already know.

What do you mean they already know?

I told them.

I'm moving on.

And just like that, they
said, "Hey, no problem, Henry.

"Let us know if you need a
letter of recommendation."

Stop finger fucking me, man.

Just get the lime and the
shovel outta the trunk,

let's bury the body, and go eat.

I'm tired, Tim.

I've been around death way too long.

You're a goddamn angel of death.

You were made for this shit.

This is who you are, Henry.

Why do you think they've kept you around?

Why do you think they
make sure your tracks

are covered up?
My tracks?

No no, those are your tracks

and I'm always covering them up.

I'm constantly wiping your ass

and I'm fucking exhausted.

It's time you cleaned up your own shit.

Fuck you.

All right, I make sure the job gets done.

It's not my fault you've grown
some sort of pussy down there

and now you want to complain
about being my cleanup bitch.

You've gone soft, you limp dick.

No pussy exit on this ride.

[gun firing]


Now get over there
and clean that shit up.

[phone ringing]

Yeah.

Yeah, we're done.

I'm just wrapping things up.

Okay.

We're still in agreement, right?

One more and I'm gone, a clean break.

Two more?

You promise me after this...

Goddamn, you are heavy.

Gotta work out, buddy.

All right.

Oh yeah.

[package rustling]

Mm, yummy yummy.

Okay.

You want something to drink?

Yeah, probably dehydrated.




Asshole.

All right, two more and I'm gone.

[dirt crunching]

Yup.

All right, dinner's served, bitch.


[crunching footsteps]

[car door opening]

Shit.

Well, anything I do, it doesn't matter.

To them, anyway.

As long as they got big boy
Henry swinging his hammer.

[car door shutting]

[fabric rustling]

[leaves rustling]

[crunching footsteps]

That them?

Yup.

Told 'em we took care of it, yeah?

Yeah.

I'm kind of hungry, you
wanna get some pancakes?

We've got our next job.

Some kid, shit head,
running with their stuff.

Where?
Out in the Flint Hills,

they think he's headed for Denver.

Shit.

I was really looking
forward to some pancakes.

[car door opening]

We have time.

[car door opening]

[car door shutting]

[car door shutting]

I could go for a coffee
and scrambled eggs.

Yeah?

Think I saw an IHOP a few miles back.

Let's grab some grub, get a move on.

You know they don't like us to be late.

[car engine starting]

No, they don't.

[tense music]

I say we head west
today across the bluffs.

These byways aren't giving us any luck.

We should hit interstate by nightfall.

Ha.

I spoke too soon.

[car approaching]

Hey man, need a ride?

Yeah, that'd be great.

My wife and I have been
walking all morning.

[tense music]

Hey buddy, you okay?

[tense music]

[hurried footsteps]

[car driving away]

[water running]

[gentle music]

Hey.

What are you doing?

We just missed a ride.

Come on, see if you can
get one all the way across.

We gotta keep moving, love.

[gentle music]




[crunching footsteps]

Isn't this nice?

Yeah.

I love spending time alone with you.

Too bad we can't get enough of it.

I'm just never home.

Ever since I married you,

all I ever wanted was
just to make you happy.

It just seems like it never added up.

Remember that shit old apartment
we stayed in on Jefferson?

With the spent oil tank.

Didn't get above 10
degrees the whole week.

And you got up in the middle of the nigh

to go to the closet and
grab another blanket

because you knew, because you knew

if we'd raise that thermostat even

one degree, we wouldn't make rent.

And I just laid there,
pretending to be asleep,

knowing there was nothing
I could do about it.

Do you know how that
makes me feel, Michelle?

As a man?

We started a family.

Did you have to bring that up?

Benjamin.

[gentle music]

We have to get back to the road.

[gentle music]

[pack rustling]

[tense music]

I'm tired.

Michelle.

I'm not ready.


[crunching footsteps]

[tense music]

[insects buzzing]


[crunching footsteps]



Fucker.



Fucker.






[insects buzzing]

[insects buzzing]

[thermos scraping]

[water glugging]


Snake bite.

Yeah.

Did you do this?

You weren't gonna make it.

Poison had gotten pretty
deep into your system.

Gave you some antivenom
and got you all cleaned up.

Thanks.

[insects buzzing]

You carry antivenom on you?

Of course.

These hills are infested
with rattlesnakes.

You gotta be more careful.

They'll come out to the
road this time of year.

Take care of yourself.

Wait, what, what, are
you, what are, what,

what are you doing out here?

Playing hero.

See any cars lately?

We're probably due for one.

You should rest.

I got somewhere to be.

Well then don't let me keep you.

[ominous music]
[insects buzzing]

Shit.

[ominous music]
[insects buzzing]

[approaching footsteps]

Got any water left in there?

Uh, yeah.

Here.

[thermos clunking]


[water sloshing]

You really do need to
be more prepared out here.

Yeah well, I don't do this that often.


[water sloshing]

What's "this"?

Um, hitchhiking.

[pack rustling]


What?

[throat clearing]

What are you doing?

Why are you laying there?

I'm hitchhiking.

What if, what if a car comes?

You're not gonna be able to see it.

I'm not going to try and see someone

that won't try and see me.
What?

I'm filtering.
Filtering.

Yeah, the bullshit.

Saves me the hassle of broadcasting myself

to an audience that won't listen.

What does that even mean?

You're lying in the dirt in the

middle of nowhere.
Yeah.

Sound familiar?

What's got you in such a hurry, anyway?


I'd say by that right hook,

you're trying to get away from someone.

You don't know me.
No, I don't.

But I do know when I see
someone who's running.

Name's Ben.

Mine's Travis.

Running thief, huh?
What?

Well, let's just hope Trent doesn't

find you out here.
What?

The bag.

You don't have to worry, Trent.

I wouldn't trust some
guy sitting in the dirt

out in the middle of nowhere either.

Besides,

I'd never lose a fair fight.

So how long you been out here?

Oh, I don't know.

Couple days?

Weeks?

[insects buzzing]

Oh shit, years?

Give or take.
Years.

Did Obama get that second term?

Fuck this.

[crunching footsteps]

Okay.

That was short-lived.

He's definitely running.

[insects buzzing]

[crunching footsteps]

Want some?

Do you know where the interstate is?

[wheezing laughter]

What's so funny?

What's so fucking funny?


I've never seen someone
run so fast to nowhere.


Okay I'm just a little lost

and I needed a little sense direction.

Do you think you can help me
out or are you just going to

sit in the dirt another couple years?

You know, I make it a point

in my meager existence to say your truth.

I've been alone out here for a while now.

It allows me just to let things pass by.

Gives me a chance to soak it all in.

I know when I see
someone who's on the run.

Look, you don't understand...

Hey hey.
You don't get...

You know where you're heading out there?

Being lost is a pretty shitty feeling.

I know a lot about that.

So, I offered you the only thing I had.

A little bit of water
and a shit load of time.

I don't have that.

You're gonna have to, out here.

I mean, that snake bite
almost took you out.

You're not invincible.

[insects buzzing]

[gravel crunching]

Ever have deer jerky before?

No, not much of a hunter.

No, me neither.

I'm not into killing animals.

Do you know I picked this shit up

off the side of the
road a couple days back?

Oh fuck.


Fucking [spits] fuck, God.


It's just jerky.


Ugh, God.

Where are you headed?

You know, I don't know yet.

You don't know?
Yet.

So, when will you know?

Oh, when I hitch a ride.
No shit.

No, the right ride for me.

What, you're trying to tell me you're

some Forrest Gump trek
of life or something?

I didn't exactly pack my magic shoe.

You running, too?

Too?

I'm not running, I'm,

I'm chasing.

Oh yeah?

What's that, other than a run?

Okay, this is going to sound dumb.

I'm looking for ever after.

The proverbial happily ever after?

Yeah, it sounds lame when you
say it like that, nevermind.

Why do we always have to put our asses

out there for other people's bullshit?

I mean, why is it bad
to chase what I want?

Is that wrong?

Fuck em.

Who?

It doesn't matter now.

Hey give, let me have
some more of that jerky.

I didn't know how hungry I was.


Life is an interesting game, isn't it?

[insects buzzing]

I've crapped out lots of times.

I used to let things get to me.

Now I just let it roll off.

How are you satisfied with that?

It's not about satisfaction.

It's about understanding.

That's bullshit, then.

You're not a fucking tumbleweed.

Isn't there anything
you want more than this?

I don't know.

So,

where you're from?

Kansas City.

Oh yeah, Kansas or Missouri?
Missouri.

KCMO.
Okay.

There's a difference, trust me.

What's that?
A shit ton.

The one thing we share is a name.

Fucking hate Kansas.

What about you, where you from?

All over.

What does that mean?

I've been traveling so long,
I really don't have a from.

What do you carry in that bag?

Excuse me?

Being here in the middle of nowhere

with nothing to your name but

that beat up old hat, this
crusty jerky, and that bag,

that bag's gotta be the most
valuable thing in your life.

Um.

All right.


What the hell's this?

[phone ringing]

[flip phone opening]

Hello?
Hey babe, how's it going?

[truck door closing]

Hey, love.
How're my ladies doing?

Oh, we're hanging in there.

You're in the nursery,

aren't you?
Mm-hm.

Gotten anything new done in there?

Well, the walls are painted purple

because you know I hate pink,

the crib is up, and the mobile is hung.

What about the bookshelf?

It's up, too.

I've been filling it with some

books I found in my mom's attic.

On one of my runs, I stopped at

a flea market down in Phoenix.

There's this older woman there
who made these worry dolls.

She said you were supposed
to share all your worries

to the doll and it'll
take them away from you.

You are always buying stuff.

I don't think this nursery

can hold everything you bring home.

I made that one, the
woman taught me how.

It's beautiful, I love it.

Well, I gotta run.

I'm gonna grab a hot shower.

I'll see you on Thursday.

I love you.
I love you, too.

[flip phone closing]

[tense music]

Let go of that.

[insects buzzing]



[rocks clattering]

Why are you carrying rocks in your bag

I don't need to explain
shit to you, all right?

How dare you invade my life?
Invade your life?

What's wrong with you?

Don't expect people to pour
their hearts out to you

so you can guide them through life,

give them a piece of your wisdom,

and then bitch our when they
put it into the spotlight.

Excuse me?

You don't know shit.
It's all over your face.

Who saved your sorry ass?

You think you know something?

You think you know somebody?

I've got years on you, you piss ant.

You've got a lot to learn
about life and people.

Yeah, more like you forgot.
Stay away from me, Trent.

Forget we ever crossed paths.

What are you doing?
It doesn't matter,

you can be somebody else's problem.

No, I didn't mean it that way.

No, you're hurt, Ben.

It's obvious.
Hey, stop, all right?

You're right, all right?

I buddied up to you trying to solve

your problems like some roadside Dr. Phil.

You found the bullshit card,
so just move on, Trent.

I'm sorry, all right, I'm sorry.

So that's it.

This is bullshit.

Who's running now?
C'mon.

[backpack thudding]

What the fuck do you want from me,

huh?
I don't know.

That I'm some piece of shit truck driver

that was always working,
always on the road?

I drove as fast as I could,
but I honestly thought

everyone was freaking out over nothing.

I,

I didn't see the signs.


I was ignorant

and a fucking idiot.


[dramatic music]

I took them for granted.

I didn't realize.
Ben.

She was the only one

who loved me.

Even when I wasn't there
for her, she still loved me.

I knew what they were all saying.

I knew what they all thought.

But I didn't give a shit.

[dramatic music]

But she knew, she knew the truth.


I was her strength, dammit,
and I fucking lost her.

I lost both of them.

I lost both of em


This road.


[dramatic music]

[sharp inhaling]

So I walk.

Lost.

Because I lost everything to this road.

I ain't running, man.

[car whooshing past]

[car approaching]

[brakes squealing]

[shifter clunking]

What's your fucking deal, man?

You haven't said shit to me
since breakfast and you just

sat there staring at your
phone the whole fucking time.

What's going on?

We are all formed of frailty and error.

That is the first law of nature.

What the fuck are you talking about?

Voltaire, an asshole.

Is that some sort of
men's cologne or something?

Look, instead of being
all cryptic and shit,

if you've got something to say,

just say it to my fucking face, all right?

You don't have a problem
whizzing bullets past my head.

I want 30 on pump one and
I want some sunflower seeds

and I want change.
Okay.

Buy your own smokes.
All right.

[car door opening]

[car door closing]

Guy is fucking losing it.

[tin clanking]

[car door opening]

[car door closing]




Yeah, it's a pretty town, eh?

Yeah.

[door creaking]

[bell jingling]

[door closing]
[bell jingling]

[car door opening]

[car door closing]

[door opening]
[bell jingling]

[tense music]



[soft footsteps]

[door opening]

Hey, where are you going?

Where you going?

That your ride over there?

It's a nice ride.

Where are you staying, you new in town?

Well, you got a phone number?

Hey, I bet you got them panties
with the words on em, huh?

[car door opening]

[car door opening]

[car door closing]

[engine starting]

[gravel crunching]

[car doors closing in succession]

Did you get my seeds?

Yeah, I got your seeds.

What'd you think about that one?

That one?

Eh, he was okay.

Keeping my options open.

That option I think
wouldn't be a real good catch.

Henry, you old horn dog.

She's not gonna want a suck
on this old saggy balls.

Why don't you leave the bitches to me

and do what you do best?


That's exactly what I'm doing.

[car engine starting]

[tense music]

[engine revving]


[wrench clanging]

Well, this here's your culprit, ma'am.

I really appreciate this.

Oh, you're welcome.

You know, you're lucky I
was headed out this way.

I got a bull that got outta
pasture about 10 miles west here

and I don't get out here too
often, so you're pretty lucky.


[car door opening]

You folks use a hand?

Actually, I just got this
young lady taken care of, so.

Sorry about this.

[gun firing]

[gravel crunching]

[gun firing]

[gun firing]

Woo!


Don't fucking kill her.


Man oh man, the reaper bleeds.

Shut up.
Hey,

don't get any on the seat.


Shit man, seriously, though.

In the eight years that
we've been working together,

the hits that I've seen you take down

and the near death moments that we've

just fucking scraped by and nothing,

nothing compares to your
ultimate rival, 120 pound Barbie.


Oh God, when the guys here about this,

they'll stop busting
my balls for a change.

[tape ripping]




Yeah?

Yeah.

Do you think we're close?

Where there's smoke, there's fire.

Then let's light this bitch up.

[tense music]

[insects chirping]

So what's going to happen?

Kill me, of course.

Can't let that happen, though.

She's waiting for me.

Who?


[paper rustling]

Whoa.

She's beautiful.

Alison.

How'd you meet her?

[breathy laughing]

You know how they say love finds you?

Yeah.
It found me.

You'll never believe where.

[car engine idling]

So you fall?
No.

Yeah, kind of.

You never heard of indoor skydiving?

Not really.

Whatever.

These jobs keep getting
weirder and weirder.

Come on.

[car doors opening]

[car doors closing]

[traffic passing]

[muffled music]

Drop's over there.

C'mon Robbie, you can
be smarter than that.

Let's get our suits and stick to the plan.

Hello.
Hi.

Hi guys, okay, so you're
going to need a suit.

Oh.
This one's mine?

Yeah.
Thank you.

Okay.
This is way too much cool.


Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.

[door opening]

[fabric rustling]

You okay?
I'm fine.

Let's just get this shit done.

What's going on?


Robbie, half the shit
you say I don't like.

Just tell me.
Hear about Darrel and Jason?

What about em?

They were supposed to
be on a high dollar drop

last week.
So what?

They asked me to go with Jason instead.

Wait, what?
Yeah, I know.

But I think Darrel fucked up.

I heard he wanted to know if
the that was inside the bag

was worth more than the
money they were paying him.

So they're switching up co-ops now?

I started asking around.

His crew, his family,
nobody's heard from him.

Trent, that's what they
do with people like us,

you know, if we don't stick to the plan.

Apparently I'm not
part of this new plan.

Trent, I'm worried things are changing.

Get this shit done.

We'll talk more about this later.

[door slamming]

[tense music]


[muffled music]

You ever do this before?
No, first time.

You're gonna love it,
there's nothing like it.

It's not every day
you get a chance to fly,

right?
Exactly.

I'm here once a week.
Once a week?

Yeah.

If you had the opportunity to fly,

wouldn't you do it as much as you could?

She's weird.
Yeah,

we tried to get her to go shopping

or to the movies with us, but she'd rather

be here with her head in the clouds.

It's a different way to spend your time.

You ever have a flying dream before?

Not in a while.

This is what it feels like.

[throat clearing]

Sup guys, y'all ready to fly?

Yeah.
Cool, all right,

well let's go ahead and
get all of our gear on.

That way we'll have
everything ready to go.

Ali, you don't need to hear this again,

but for everybody else,
just remember relax,

all right, hold nice and still,

and just try to keep your
chin up the entire time.

Okay.
All right,

so Ali, I know you probably
wanted to hop in solo this time,

but we're kind of backed
up and really busy.

Do you mind pairing up with somebody?

Yeah, sure.
Cool.

How about you go with your friend here?

Sound good, friend?

Who am I supposed to go with?

Do you mind going with my friend here?

Yeah, that's fine.

I'll go with you and then
Ali, you can go with...

Trent.
Cool, all right.

Ali, Trent, are you guys ready to fly?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Sweet, well let's hope in and fly.

All right.
All right.

Hey, don't get too distracted.

[door opening]

[gentle music]

All right I'll turn up

your time.
Okay.

Nervous?
No.

A little?
Don't be.

Here, hold my hands.

When they start it up, don't
fight it, let it take you up.

Then what?
Go with it.

I'll hold onto you.

[gentle music]

[air hissing]

[gentle music]


So?
All right.

What'd you think?
All right, all right,

it was cool.
[laughs] Right?


not look like too much of a fool in there.


Looks like your friend
is handling it well.


Oh god.

So you really come here once a week?

Yeah, I've been coming
for about a month now.

It's crazy, I know, but it just

seems to be the best way to get a break.

You don't need to know about that.

A break from what?

People.

Ah, like a boyfriend.

No boyfriend.

My parents.

They're always poking
their head into something.

It can be a little much.

I actually have no
idea what that's like.

It's exhausting.

They mean well but they have
everything mapped out for me.

That I know about.

It sucks when other people
are calling the shots.

It is exhausting.

Even more so, you just feel robbed.

Hey.
Hm?

Did you forget something?

Thanks.
Uh huh.

What'd you think?

You like it?

Eh, it's not really my cup of tea.

Next time.

It gets better with practice.

Oh, yeah.

We can't be late.

Sorry, I,

I gotta get going.

It's okay, I better
get back to my friends

anyway.
Yeah.

Can I see you again?

You know where to find me.

Yeah.



Was she there next Sunday?

Yeah.

Yeah, we met up there every Sunday

for the rest of the summer.

Indoor skydiving?

Yeah, indoor skydiving.


You know how you look at a
woman that you're attracted to

and then she gives you a look
back and then looks away,

you know, waiting for the chase?

Yeah.

[insects buzzing]

She never looked away.

Her eyes never left mine.

She didn't want the chase.

[insects buzzing]

So where is she waiting for you?

Denver.

We gotta be there by tomorrow.

Denver?

Tomorrow?

You do know that's more than

500 miles west?
I know.

We'll make it.

There's not a lot of traffic out here.

The nearest city is 30 plus miles...

Just because you didn't
make it doesn't mean I won't.


I didn't mean to say it like that.

No, it's okay.

You're right.

I don't, I don't care who's right.

I just want to get there.

Don't you think they'll expect you

heading west?
Maybe.

Which is why I got to stay a step ahead.

That's what brought me out here.

I thought going through this,
this would keep me hidden.

You know, if I'm in nowhere,
how can they get me?

Yeah, but 500 miles in one day on foot?

I don't know, Trent.

[insects chirping]

How about you?

Ben?

Me?

Yeah.

Ben, you.

Help me.

Help me get out of this.

I mean,

I mean, shit, all this time.


You've been here, no, how
long have you been out here?

Years, right?

Just out here in these hills.

I got my own...
No, no, you'd be perfect.

No, you know these hills,
you know these hills

like they were your own home.

Come with me, Ben.

You know all the shortcuts and the byways.

You'd be the perfect person

to get me out west under the radar.

Can't you tell her
you're running behind?

No, no, there's no
contacting each other.

I don't have a phone.

Cause then that way
they'd be able to find us.

All we have is a location and a time.

Ben, please.

They won't just kill me.

I can't be a part of any more...

Fuck.
I just can't.

[heavy breathing]

All right.

I know this back road,
five miles east of here.

That's the wrong way.

There'll be a truck stop there

where a lot of I70 truckers stop.

There'll be a lot of Colorado plates.

You're bound to catch a ride there.

[insects buzzing]

You sure?

Yeah, it was my route.

I guess.

I've been trying to find
a faster way out of here,

a better way,

since I lost them.

[insects chirping]

Trust me.

Okay.

[gentle music]

[car approaching]

[crunching footsteps]

[car door opening]

[car door opening]

[car door closing]

[insects buzzing]

[car door closing]

[engine revving]

Thanks.
No problem.

Where you headed?

Oh, there's a truck stop
about five miles east of here.

Yeah, we know where that is.

Car break down?

Oh, I don't have a car.

So what are you doing out
here in the middle of nowhere?

Uh, just traveling.

Traveling? On foot?

What, are you on some kind
of crusade or something?

Aren't we all?

[ominous music]

Where you guys heading?

Not really heading anywhere.

How do you mean?

It's uh, It's not so much a where.

But a who.

Who are you looking for?
A friend of ours.

Got lost out here.

The Flint Hills, they're like,

like the Bermuda Triangle of the Midwest


You know, people, they, they get in he

and then they just disappear.

It's kind of freaky, really.

What do you think, Henry?
Shit, yeah.

It's, it's open, desolate.

Real easy for somebody to lose their way

[tense music]

Could you pull over?
What's wrong?

I just gotta piss.

Can you hold it?

We're almost there.

Yeah, no, I really gotta go.

If you could just pull
out right over here.

I'll be quick.

All right, Henry.

I guess when you gotta go, you gotta go.

I guess so.

[tense music]

[gravel crunching]

[brakes squealing]

[car door opening]
[car door shutting]

You don't have to be shy,
we're all men out here.

No, don't worry.

What's the matter, you got a small dick?

I mean it's okay if you got a tiny pecker,

we won't laugh too hard.

Hey, where do you think you're going?

[gun firing]

I don't think you want to be running.

[tense music]


Ali, Ali.

No no no no, don't shoot
her, don't, don't shoot her.

Yeah.


Does she think you have a little dick?

Do you?


Does he got a little midget dick?

No no no, don't, don't,
don't, don't hurt her, please.

That's pretty fucked up.

This midget dick motherfucker
got you into shit.

Gonna get you killed and couldn't
even probably get you off.

Please don't, don't hurt her.

Did you really think he
couldn't be found, Trent?

Look, I know who you are.

I know they sent you.

I'm not trying to hurt anybody.

I'm just trying to get out of this shit.

[gun firing]

Fuck, no, fuck, stop.

Just stop, please stop.

No, you know what,
you fucking stop, okay?

Don't fucking move.
Okay, no, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, just, no, I'm sorry.


I'm sorry, no no, tell them I'm sorry.

Yeah, it's a little
late for sorries, Trent.

Damn, I know my head wasn't on straight.

Yeah, no, here.

Here, here, here's the bag.

Here's the bag, now just don't hurt her.


She's bleeding, man, come on.

No, just, she just...
Just stay the fuck back

or I'm gonna put her
brains all over the ground.

Okay, okay, I'll do whatever you say.

Shut the fuck up.

Jesus, just shut up.

You must have a small dick, man.

Look at you, look how pathetic you look.

Crying like a little bitch
and your woman's in harm's way

and bleeding out here in the
middle of fucking nowhere

and you're running off
like a little pussy.

Do you even know who you're fucking with


[ominous music]

[car door closing]

It's here, it's what they want.

Good.

I guess we got what we need.

Yeah, it is.

I've done everything you said.

Now please, will you let her go?

[crunching footsteps]

Come on, baby.

[gentle music]

And they lived happily ever after.

[gun firing]

[stark silence]

[tense music]

No, fuck.

No.

Oh God.

[pained crying]

[gentle music]

That is beautiful.


Oh God.

[gentle music]

You know how this works, Trent.


You take from them, we take from you.

Ah, yeah.

[gun firing]

[tense music]

Woo!

Oh.

Mm. [laughs]


Oh fuck, they should've paid
us double for that bitch.

Yeah.

Yeah, we've got it, package is secure.

So are you going to
help me this time, huh?

Cause I'm not burying
these fuckers by myself.

Yeah, I should be back by nightfall.

Hey, what'd you mean by "I"?

I'm taking care of that now.
Oh shit.

[gun firing]

[gentle music]

[gravel crunching]

[gentle music]

[grass rustling]

[rustling footsteps]


[fabric rustling]


[fabric rustling]


[gentle music]

[fabric rustling]

[gentle music]

[insects buzzing]

[trunk shutting]

[gentle music]

So what about you?

What brings you out here
in the middle of nowhere?

Ah, I had some loose ends to tie up.

Now that that's done, get back to my life.

Oh yeah, what's that?
My life?

Retirement.

Retirement?

At your age?

You either have a good paying job

or the health risk must be high.


So, what are you planning
on doing in retirement?

Fish, paint model airplanes,
play chess at the park?


Um.

I have no idea, but

whatever it is, I'm ready for it to start.

It's time, man.
It is.

Mm.

You have a family?

Never married.

I do have a son, though.

He's gotta be

15, 16 years old by now.

Hm, been a while since you've seen him?

Yeah, the career didn't really

mix too well with family life.

Demanding line of work.

Yeah.

The same thing happened to me.

I was a truck driver.

I was always out on the road.

Ended up losing my wife
and daughter because of it.

Yeah, they tend to not
stick around too long

when you're gone working all the time.

Yeah.

Are you gonna try and see your son?

Yeah.

Yeah, I think so.

I look forward to him telling
me what a shitty father I am.


Let him flush all that out.

Being there for him to do it, it'll count.

It'll help heal.

What about you, you
talk much to your family?

No, my, my family passed away.

I'm sorry to hear that.

You know, when, when death is

all that's been a part of your world,

having a life is
impossible to think about.

You know?

Yeah.

Yeah, I do.

[rock music]

Mind if I turn this up?

I like this song.

No, not at all.

[rock music]

â™ª Say the mean guy's gonna find you â™ª

â™ª Oh wherever you roam â™ª

[rock music]

[car approaching]

[car door opening]

[car door closing]


[car door closing]

I really appreciate this,
Henry, for the ride.

No problem.

I've been out there a long time.

Too long.

It's hard to get a ride out
in the middle of nowhere.

It's just a matter of time.

Somebody would have
picked you up eventually.

Thanks.

[gas cap flipping]

[ominous music]

Something the matter?

No.

No.

I'm good.

Well, I hope you make
it to where you're going.

Yeah.

Thanks.

You okay?

Yeah, yeah I'm good.

Hell, I've been on the road

for seven years now, I'll be fine.

[tense music]

Be careful, there's a lot
of dangerous people out there.

Yeah.

Yeah, swell.

Thank you for everything.

Hey, good luck with your son.

[gas nozzle clicking]

Good luck finding where you're going.

[tense music]

[birds chirping]

[gas nozzle clattering]

[tense music]
[birds chirping]

To new beginnings.

[car door opening]

New beginnings.

[car door closing]

[engine turning over]

[tense music]

[door creaking open]
[bell ringing]

[tentative footsteps]

You got any maps of Colorado?

Uh, yeah.

How much?
Uh, $2.25.

[money sliding]

[map crumpling]

[bell tinkling]
[door creaking]

[tense music]

[paper crinkling]

[insects buzzing]

[crunching footsteps]

Okay.

I need you to do something for me.

What?

I need you to swear to me,
swear you'll get this to Ali.

What do you mean, "Get this to Ali?"

If I don't make it.

You'll make it as long as you

keep moving...
Ben, stop.

I'm running pretty hard
from some pretty heavy shit.

If you get there first.
First?

You've gotta help me.
I am.

No, stop, please.

I got to get to her somehow.

If not in person,

if not in person, then by this.

[sighs] Trent, I can't.
You can.

You know these roads better than anyone.

Hell, you're probably the
best person who could do this.

[insects buzzing]

I got my own problems...
Ben.

I don't need to be screwing up yours.

Ben, people used me, took from me.

Maybe that's why I'm
running, but why I'm taking,

she's never asked for anything
from me, and this is me.

Even shit as fucked up as
it is, this is who I am.

Yes, on the run, but I ran into you.

Maybe there's a reason for this.

I mean, shit, look, look at us.

It seems pretty obvious
on this empty road.

I trust you, Ben.

[insects chirping]


How do I find her?

There's a diner, it's on Colfax Avenue.

Be there at 11:15 am sharp.

Sit in the far back.

Then what?
Just wait.

She knows the location and the time.

And will she know that I'm with you?

When she gets up to the
table, call her girly.

She'll know you're with me.

All right.

can't thank you enough.

Head three miles up that road,

you'll find that truck stop.

Good luck.

[receding footsteps]

[gentle music]

Hey, do me a favor.

Like this isn't enough of one?

Don't come back.

Here, out here.

She doesn't want the chase anymore.

I'll see you in Denver.

Hey, you owe me a cup of coffee.

All right.

[receding footsteps]

[paper rustling]

[rustling footsteps]


[toast popping]

[cutlery clattering]

[bell tinkling]

[bell tinkling]

[cutlery clattering]

Hey, can I get you something?

Oh.
Other than coffee?

No, coffee will be just fine, thank you.

Listen, are you, are you
sure I can't get you something?

Eggs, some bacon, I'm sure I can

rustle something up for you.

Thanks, but I'll be fine.

Wait, is that clock correct?

Yes, sir.

[gentle music]

[paper rustling]


If you're reading this, it's
because I wasn't fast enough.

I'm so sorry for all this.

I saw a life that was perfect.

I was actually happy.

I can honestly say I don't
think I had ever been

truly happy with my life
until you were a part of it.

Out of all the mess in my
life, all the wrong, you,

you were the only thing
that made sense in it.

I just wanted to get away from the mess,

get away from the lie I was living.

I wanted it so bad for us that
I ignored what it would cost.

[Trent & Michelle] What was that risk?

But you were worth it.

You are worth it.


You can show me that you
love me by moving forward.

Live for me.
