INTERN
MUNDO FASHION -

Is that Nina Zamoi?

I can't believe that the editor of
"Vogue" is going to parade...

her bony at the Skirt party!
Dare she!

Fag!
Asshole!

So I don't care about
a neurotical, I mean...

he got me to stop eating sushi for
about 20 min. But then I said...

seize the damn!
I'm not gonna be sway

I mean... it's not that I'm dying
to tear it out but...

honestly, what's the worst
thing that can happen?

I get a tapeworm and I eat
what I like, and still...

Iose 20 pouds? I'd rather be
like Karen Carpenter...

on the top of the world,
looking down on creation.

Wouldn't that be dreaming?

But enough about "moi". What did
you say your name was again?

Jocelyn.
And you work at...

Skirt Magazine.
Roxanne Rochet, I love her like a sister!

What do you do there?
You know... this and that.

Details, darling!
Are you a writer, a stylist?

I'm a "head pian".
Excuse me?

The resident xerox core.
And what is this?

I'm an intern.

She's an intern

She's an intern

A pathetic, nulling
intern

Slaved little
intern

Fax this

Slaved little
intern

Get me coffee
Kiss my ass

Sometimes she may get the blues
But everyone would spin and lose

You may think life isn't fair

But everybody's got
to start somewhere

Get me coffee
Kiss my ass

If the paginator loses the notes
Your duty then should be harpon

Vegetables, cocktails
cappucino skin

That's the way it goes
in the mags

Honey, it sleeps on twirls

Get me coffee
Kiss my ass

Capuccino skin
Kiss my ass

Sometimes she may get the blues
But everyone would spin and lose

You may think life just isn't fair

But everybody's got
to start somewhere

The pathetic

Nulling intern

I am Jocelyn Bennett, and we are at
the Skirt Magazine headquarters...

i.e., where fashion trends
are invented.

How about how you got here.

Well, I think I took my school
model a little bit too serious.

When I was taught not to be
served but to serve...

I think they had God's
delivery in mind...

and not fashion magazines. I could
be in the staff of "Glamour"...

but I'd rather be
an intern at Skirt.

I like to think of myself as a
missionary to salvage the tacky.

This is our Associate Greeter,
a.k. A, receptionist.

Hey, Deborah.

Deborah Duchet is the Gatekeeper,
the "Saint Peter" of Skirt...

She separates the men from the
boys. Let's watch her in action.

What the hell are all these
cameras doing here?

I'm doing a tour for channel 13
that nobody else wanted to get.

Hello, Skirt.
Isn't she a genius?

Let's move on.

That's Roxanne Rochet,
our Fashion Director...

let's follow her.

Don't you just love
her Chanel?

This is her first day back
since the accident.

Her breast implant exploded
on a Concorde.

The show must go on. Messages?
Get Tokio on line 1.

Get my boots back to Christine,
because they need new legs.

Give me an overwrap.
Did you call Garin?

What's going on with
John Bartlett photo shoot?

Get me an overwrap,
I want an...

Himalaian rejuvenation lime
and berry acid peel.

And get me some Valium,
I'm suffering from such jet lag.

Where is Cecilia Soleil?

She's on maternity leave
this month.

This month?

It only takes one day to bung with a baby.

Yes, Roxanne?
Capuccino.

Right away, Roxanne.

Okay, let's move on.

This is the Editor Large.

This is the Editor Super Large...

and this is the Editor
Slender Regular.

Actually, I'm not sure
what they do.

They just sort of gormegan
from sale to sale.

Excuse me, Antoinette?
Bob.

No. I'm Jocelyn.

No, you need a bob.
Everybody, there's been a tragedy.

Chi Chi Chemise's fainted.

Messages?
No, let's go take at that.

"C'est quis pas"?
Perspective, Vogue just came out.

There's an article on it just like
we'll have on our next issue.

Of course there's been a leak.
Another leak?

Can you believe it? It's the third
issue in a row this's happened.

That is no coincidence.
There must be Yuri.

What's a "Yuri"?
A spy, you idiot...

like Mata Hari, James Bond...
When was the last time she ate?

She had an apple 2 days ago,
she should be fine.

Just the trauma from the article?

Maybe we should take her
shoes off or something.

Oh, my God!

Where are my shoes?
Here.

We should get out of here.

Many years of pointing, you know...

ballet.

Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
Don't worry, Jocelyn.

How do you know my name?

I don't know.

This is Paul Rochester,
Deputy Art Director.

Hello.

Have a nice tour.

Thanks.

Well... you go...
you go that way.

Where to now?
The Beauty Department.

What, what is it?
Whore!

Who?
Whore is here.

Roxane Rochett?
Not that whore, the nail enamel!

Whore!
What does it mean?

It means fuck me,
but respect me.

Worship my body, but the
upkeep is going to be costly.

Stripe me, spurn me,
treat me as your Spaniel.

I'm your dog and I'm
gonna break the leash on you!

Calm down, Cornelia! Arf! Arf!
I'm sorry!

Just transports me to a dirty
corner of 42nd street.

Breathlessly.
That's naughty!

I adore the shade!
Who the fuck are you?

Why do we care what you think?
What are you, an intern?

Yes.

What about that last intern?

She had those bug eyes, looked
like Courtney Cox on chemo.

Let me give you two pieces of
advice: Always wear black and...

you never finish shitting
until you piss again.

Remember that and
you'll be fine here.

Thank you, I'll keep it in mind.
I'm just busting your balls!

Come on!
You can laugh!

I like her vibe, though! - Nice vibe.

Good vibe! Come visit me
in my office and...

We'll chat sometime.
A little less rouge.

Are we working or
are we chatting?

Pardon me?

Yeah! Obviously you!
Who else would I be talking to?

Rocky, the camera man?
Director "odd" Photography.

Oh, great!
Come here now! Chop-chop!

You remember when I asked you
to do a special project for me?

Did you see it...
Yeah, I saw it!

I found it. You'd better look
your intern ass I found it!

And I found something along
with it too: Errors, major ones.

Errors that we cannot
afford to make.

Like what?
Honey...

we are not at "Harper's Bazaar".

The big boss down the hall
would not be thrilled.

She'd be very glad that
I had a spare moment...

to oversee this...
this "work".

I delegated this project to you
because I thought you could...

handle it, unfortunately,
I've learned you can't.

Re-typing my rolodeck was just
that difficult task for you, huh?

For example:
Lann Wayner's card.

Why is there only
one "n"on lann?

Did you know he added
an extra "n" years ago?

Andy Warhol's card, did you even
think to verify this number?

No, because he's dead.
Excuses!

You just don't get it, do you?
Dead or alive, I still...

need their phone
numbers.

This is for your own benefit,
not mine, okay?

No bad blood?

It's curse!

Dolly! You're back from the
couture show! How is Lacroix?

That is Dolly Bellows,
she's an institution.

Give me a tissue.
That man is a genius!

The word genius is
really in overuse

Lacroix transcends the
English language. My God!

How could they think threatical
vehicles as words can express...

what Lacroix is all about?
Don't they get it?

Don't they understand?
He's not about a dictionary...

he's about spirit!
Oh, God!

Spirit, spirit, spirit!
Any messages?

A fax is coming in.

From Europe!

Paris studios.
Carl Lagerfeld to...

the Editor in Chief.

I have a fax for the
Editor in Chief.

The Editor in Chief is
waiting for it.

You can go in.

I'm sorry to interrupt,
I have a fax for you.

Okay. Thanks.

The work is piling up, and
I really should be getting to it.

I have to retype a roll of decks,
get tea, pick up a huge garment...

bag, anyway, the xerox
machine awaits me.

So, now you know the people
on staff aren't really snobs.

They're just better than
everybody else is. Is it enough?

That was great, thank you
. - Let me know when it's on.

I can watch in my time
off on Channel 13.

Thanks a lot, kiddo.
Hang in there.

It seems like a pretty
tough place to work.

Hey, Paul.

These are the photos for
the acessory page.

She's gonna come here and show
you exactly how she wants them.

Why won't these people
let me do my job?

I know!

What's that stuff you're
always playingwith?

"Silly Putty"!

It calms me down.

'Hobos on a Grassy Knoll"?
I love them.

They're the best band!
You know "Hobos on a Grassy Knoll"!

Totally! "The Americans"
is my favorite song!

That's impossible, no one
in the States knows them.

I saw them when they went
to London last March...

in Cambridge.
That's insane! I was there!

Get out of here! You were there?
That's crazy!

I worship this poster.
Where did you get it?

Well, I designed that, actually.
Do you know them?

Bob Green and I went to
Eton together.

Paul, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

Everywhere except
my office, I guess.

I heard you were in the shitter.

Roxanne needs you to discuss the
concept for the cover shoot...

Pardon me, Jocelyn.

Hey, cut it out. You can't
go through his drawers.

Does he not smoke? What is this?
The 21st century, no smoking...

in office buildings, go out on the
street with the rest of the junkies.

Spank me again!

I think there's a part-time
position opening at the vault.

Let's look in here.

Maybe we'll find
some naughty toys.

He doesn't exactly seem like
the kiddie-porn type.

He's such a sweetie, gorgeous!
I wished he was into sausages...

I think I'll never be graced
by his sweet ass.

You mean Paul's no gay?
Your "gaydar" is failing.

Paul is as straight as
Mark Jacob's pleat.

Interesting!
Every fashion magazine...

needs their token
hetero male.

It's like reverse feminine
action.

Fuck! I gotta dash.
I'm off that Palm press.

I think Judaism beats
Buddhism...

in the next century. I really do.
And I've got the jump-start.

I'm taking kabala classes.
I'm sure I've seen sketches of a...

Moses collection come cross my desk.
Wait a minute, haven't you seen...

at Skirt magazine?
Please, darling!

Are they finally eclipsing Vogue
in fashion for advance?

Skirt will only race clean when
it shows the bat about one ways.

It's true! They totally missed
the ball on those princess skirts.

That's because Roxanne
Rochett is Coco.

No! She's only addicted
to painkillers.

Remember her breast
exploded?

You know? I do think they're
the most creative.

Who else would've paid me to
scout that active volcano and...

and keep the diary of it?
And that burger salt layer...

was genius!
True.

Gwyneth, you like them because
you have been in every issue...

for the past three years.
Excuse me!

I like them because
they're innovators.

You'd better watch your back, Jack!
I'm not worried...

I've got someone on the inside.

You crocodile! - You know me, girl!

As you all know, our Editor
Chief's husband is suffering...

from testicular cancer.

Once again, Skirt Magazine will host
this year's carnival and ball...

"Save our balls" ball.

We'll have booze there and
I need all of you to sign up.

The clipboard will now circulate.

We have some very serious
issues to get down to.

As you know, Vogue
magazine ran...

a canteen chic feature,
and that means...

we still have an info trader
in the midst of our operation.

It was dreadful enough when they
copied that year moth explosions...

on terrific towing spreads
but now this?

I abhor Nina Zamoi.

I abhor that whore.

I wish the most evil thing in the
world would happen to her.

I wish that...

an anti-fur activist marched
into the "Four Seasons"...

and dropped a bloody dead
raccoon carcass...

onto her freezing salad,
Spiring the balzabic and blood...

all over her Valentino
contourship...

Easy.
Okay, sit down.

We are not in this battle alone,
I've enlisted the aid...

of a very valued ally.

Deep Throat?

He was instrumental in cracking the
case of the missing Manolo Blahnik.

Roxette, do you really think
we need the Deep Throat?

Why can't we just find the
Yuri within ourselves?

Call me silly, but I have
a hunch it might be...

Pierre Larroux.
Nonsense!

Pierre may be an obsequious,
ass-licking meretricious...

sick offend, but Yuri he's not.

He's off to a secret shoot...

for Vogue.

What?
Lies!

He'd better not be.

Ok, now let's move on.
Cornelia?

Chi Chi, any trend report
from the front?

I heard from the chef at "DaveÃ©",
who heard from his boyfriend...

who works backstage at Galliano,
with Orlando Pitta...

whose blow drier system just
came from the Gautier show...

that his next collection
will be revolutionary.

The girls will come out
on the catwalk...

in wheelchairs.

Wheelchair chic?

Genius!
Inspirational.

I think Da Vinci did sketches
of wheelchair prototypes.

We can use those for the layout.
I have goose bumps.

Nine pages!

Jocelyn, I see you put your name
down for the...

"make your own video" booth.
Do you know?

I think I'm gonna join you
on that one.

Paul, Jocelyn, why don't you guys
run over to Gustav's studio now...

and I'll be there in a few minutes
All right? Just sit tight.

Great!

Hi, this is Luke Perry telling you
to buckle up...

cause anything worse than
slamming into the windshield...

is getting a whip of Jason
Priestley's breath in the morning.

Who's bad enough that every taxi
in New York reaps...

but now he's in the terciary level
celebrity though...

pouring us not to plunge
through the windshield.

It's an interesting way to
attempt to comeback.

It's gotta be a bummer to
be all famous...

be on the cover of Tiger B
for one decade...

and be virtually anonymous
the next.

I'd rather never be famous,
thank you.

I totally agree, but actually I
think it would be a bad attitude...

to cover a great cult or kitsch
project and disappear...

like Suburbia or somewhere
in the pan-States.

It's true. But I guess it's too
easy to get sucked in.

What the fuck is a white and
black cow doing here?

I asked specifically for an
all-black cow!

We were expecting this.
Uh! I hate cows!

Where is everybody? We're
completely understaffed.

Thank God!

You look stunning, darling.

These people are driving me crazy!

The tone art has made me!
What did he do?

He filed my second nail toe
too much, now it looks weird.

It looks perfect, darling.
The level of my eyes is...

garish blurred Mahogany rouge,
totally clashes with the rouge...

concolor lipstick. You know how
my cosmetic company hates it...

when the lip line is darker than the
lipstick, it's totally distracting.

He can't understand what I say!
Darling...

it's a cover shoot, you don't
have to say anything.

Don't speak. No more.

Whatever. Do you want to see
what they want me to wear?

I'll let you tie my bikini strings.

Excuse me, you're not supposed
to touch that!

I beg your pardon?
No, I'm just kidding.

You are Jocelyn, right?

Alex? We met at the Couture
Birthday Fashion shoot.

Oh, yeah! How are you?
I can't believe these people, man!

They are nuts! What's up with the
tooled on that broad, you know?

We're doing fashion here,
not high art.

I guess she just takes
pride in her work.

I need you to fill the water bottles
to spray on Resin.

What? - Pierre insists...

on the misty look, I need you to
put this Evian into the bottles...

and practice spraying, now.

Yeah, I'll help you.
That's what he said.

He said to paint the cow...
You!

You are the sprinkler?
Fantastique!

A vision!

Gentle worrying eels just
outside Dublin...

Meteorology: 66 degrees, a crispy
October haze on a gray day...

the charcoal clouds, they
come, yet, back home...

I'm ready now!

Okay, okay! Let's get
this party started now!

I'm not painting that cow!
I don't care!

I told you on the phone I
wanted an all-black cow...

and you and your make-up people
are gonna paint the goddamn cow...

all black. You have to
do what I told you...

That was a long day,
wasn't it?

I can't believe we've been working
for 8 hours.

They could fly to Moscow without
they mingle ice with ice flake.

You know, Jocelyn, I gotta tell you
one thing, I think you are...

the best sprinkler
I've ever seen.

Indeed, indeed.

Marvelous!

I got a new calling. Mom
and dad are gonna love this one!

Dad, I gotta follow my heart!

Okay, my U$20.000 degree...
This is me.

I created the haze of Dublin in
a Greenwich Village studio.

You want my vision?
You want my vision?

Where is Kathy Bates
when we need her?

"I'll never let go, Jack."
Send the life-boat...

Paul, let's go.

I was just knocking around
with Jocelyn.

This is Jocelyn, your spritzer,
you met her.

Hi!

I'm gonna be late for Patrick
Tomarce's book party.

I gotta split.

Are you all right with your...

what is that?
Ribbon?

Yeah, ribbon rapping?

Jocelyn, I can help you.
Thanks, Alex.

Well, I'll see you at
the Carnival tomorrow.

Don't touch me,
you're all wet!

Jocelyn, I think we could get a cup
of coffee after or something?

Sure!
Clean-up time, Jocelyn.

Jocelyn, how are you doing?
Where have you been?

Hi, Nate, I need to pick up
Sebastian's packages.

Really? What are his packages:
Big or small?

It's his luggage from the trip
to St. Bart.

It's that stuff back there.

It's too big for you, Jocelyn.
We'll take it up.

Thanks.
While you're here...

do you think you can help us out?
Sure. What is it?

We found this package outside
our door this morning...

But it didn't have no telephone
extention or return number.

So we took it to the 4th,
Time Square, but...

That's Conde Nest.
Yeah.

It was addressed to an Andre
Leon Talley, but...

Andre Leon Talley?
Let me see this.

I don't even know where it came
from, what can I do with it?

I'll take it. Thanks!

Slow down, punter foot.
This isn't Sports Ilustrated.

Look what I just found
in the messenger center.

Where did you get this?
In the messenger center.

Somebody was trying to send it...
I've been looking all over for these.

I know, that's why...
This is very serious, Jocelyn!

I don't understand. Why you
have these layouts...

and why you're "messengering"
them to someone.

I wasn't the messenger,
I was asked to return it.

Someone left it there.
Someone?

Maybe that someone is you.
And maybe you were planning...

on sneaking them back into my
drawer before you were discovered.

Sebastian, I'm not the Yuri.
Interesting!

You're very defensive.

I can't believe this!
But I'll believe it...

until you come up
with another Yuri.

I'll keep my eye on you.

Watch your back...

jag.

Over here...

Over here.
Where?

Over here. I told you to
never contact me again.

It's an emergency.

You helped me with Manolo's
and I really need your help now...

This is different.

This goes deeper.

How deep?
Fucking motherfucker...

cock-sucker, fuck...
sorry.

It's my Tourett syndrome again.
I know. I'm used to it.

Now listen.
Red fuck!

We need help.

Somebody has been stealing our
story ideas and trading them...

to Nian Zamoi, at Vogue.
I know all about it, pussy.

Do you know who it is?
We're not gonna do it that way.

First, you're going to tell
me what you know and I'm gonna

tell you if you're right.
I have a sneaking suspicion...

it could be Pierre Larroux,
our make-up artist.

Look deeper.
Look closer.

Follow the fashion!

What do you mean?

They are brilliant!
Did you design them?

No. I have to give credit
where credit's due.

Sebastian designed them.
Yes, darling, you do know...

that I have a better grasp
on the subject than he.

It's time to pile into the town
cars and you can check the list...

for what booths you're assigned to,
and the times. And remember...

when you're not in the booths,
you're still representing Skirt.

I wish I could always have a cock
this big this close to my face.

You are disgusting!
Actually...

my room service boy in Paris...

wasn't so different from the
dimensions on this shirt

You should see him serve
more than a petit dejanuai.

You chaseabout! What did you have
on your customs card...

when you came back:
Business or pleasure?

Honey, no matter how many times you
have your croissant buttered over...

there, it's still work.
All right. Time to move out.

If you need to reach me,
you can call my beeper.

It's 197-UP-SKIRT.

The most important thing
to do right now...

This is absolute disgrace!

I can't believe we're
all the way downtown...

volunteer for this damn
charity carnival.

It's pathetic! You don't see anyone
at Vogue having to do this.

I'm the Hair Editor.
I don't crawl around...

on the ground picking up dart
in the name of expertise.

It's a fairly unusual
charity.

Although balls are important.

Antoniette, how's you husband?
You're married?

Absolutely!
And does he still live in Spain?

Yes, the Atlantic is a fabulous
thing for our relatonship.

How often do you see
each other?

At holidays!

You were a great director
in that video.

Maybe you don't screw this.

Actually I was going to be a
photographer, but the only people

who would hire me is sleazy balls
in those tabloid photo agencies.

What did you have to do?
Stalk people?

Exactly what I did.

Casually I needed to follow
Carol O'Connor...

with the sun acid by the
roof in the quarter.

That's sick!
Yeah, beyond.

I had this severe moral thing
when I was crop star...

with my first thirty pound
laker.

I backed up after that.

So, how did you end up at Skirt?
I just love Skirt.

They have the best photography
of any magazines, really...

the most innovative, stylish,
artistic shoots around.

How did you end up
in magazines?

I had an excentric uncle...

who was my idol when
I was growing up...

he was a sort of black sheep,
hip, rebel type.

While my parents are always trying
to drag me off to polo, blablabla...

he was always abducting me
and taking me...

on the most amazing adventures.
Sounds like a cool uncle.

Yeah, he was.

He was pretty much my savior
when I was a child.

My parents had a messy split,
and he saw me through that.

He knew I liked to paint
and he always encouraged.

So why don't you
paint full time?

That's what I'm trying to do...

but I like graphic design and
it helps pay the bills.

So I made a routine out of that.

Furthermore, I don't think anybody
would like to buy my paintings.

Except maybe a pizza parlor.

I'm sure people would buy
your paintings.

I have to get out of here!
I'm being harrassed!

These little beasts keep
snugging me...

begging for an autograph...

annoying me!
They are children.

And I'm not the fucking
Pied Piper.

I don't want them
following me. Shoo!

Get away! Go!
Calm down. I'm gonna be...

half an hour more
at this. Then we take...

a nice walk.
I hate walking.

Besides, my driver's around
the corner.

I have to go meet Simas
Gort Morgan...

and he's going to introduce me
to Milo Norbuck...

who's gonna be in the new CK
campaign with me.

I can. Should I come with you?

It's business.
It's business, right.

Page me tomorrow and maybe
we'll have dinner, okay?

Page?

You know, Jocelyn, I have
been inside all day...

and I would like to take
a nice walk.

Would you like to join me?
Sure, I'd love to.

Darling, change of plans.

I have to meet Norbuck,
at the Mercer, at 2AM...

let's have some dinner at Raul's.

I'll take you next time, okay?
Sure, no problem.

Okay.

Antoniette, can I borrow
your intern?

The Doyle Gallery
just called and...

they desperately need this gown.
It's the dress Kim Basinger orderly...

asked, the one with only one sleeve,
the one for the celebrity couture...

auction, immediately.

You can finish this when you
get back. Hurry up!

You heard her.
For God's sake, watch your back.

There are spies everywhere.
Trust no one.

Guard that with your soul, darling.
I shall.

I owe you lunch. November,
December or something...

our girls will figure it out.
Take yourself way back.

Look who is here,
Miss Sunshine.

Hello, Jocelyn.
Hi.

How is everything at the
mental ward downtown?

You know, reigns, but always
a learning experience.

You're a tripper!

That is lot 163.

Jocelyn, where have you been?

Kim Basinger needed to go up on
that wall hours ago.

She's the cornerstone of this
entire operation. What could've...

possibly hold you up?
Well, I guess you haven't heard?

Heard what?
Oh, nothing.

Just the revolutionary new
nail color from Mac.

Everyone's freaking out.
Chi Chi fainted.

You should've said that
right away.

I'm gonna have to have
someone messenger me some.

Where did you learn that from?
You know...

tricks and betrayals.
But it can be tricky sometimes...

to take yourself at him.
I'll try not to.

You've been upstairs?

If you get the chance, there's a
fantastic photo exibition...

up there, it is brilliant
I think you'll really love it.

Reminded me of you.

I've wrapped it up downstairs.

Maybe we can...

Maybe we can take that
walk afterall.

Sounds great.

Aren't they amazing?

Aren't they the best French
fries you've ever tasted?

I'd give them a silver medal.

Silver medal?

What are you, a German judge?
No, but I've had better.

We're gonna do a taste test.
Fine, if you go by the Printer's.

Where is this place?
In Bruges, in Flanders...

it's probable in Belgium.
Yes, I know.

I see someone with you or with a
bunch of girl friends.

I went by myself.
Did you?

How many countries did you visit?
I traveled the world.

I graduated early and got
a grant from my college...

to do a photo essay...

as part of my thesis
and that was incredible!

That is amazing. I can't believe
you did all that by yourself.

I'm so impressed!

So...

were you scared?

They tried to stripsearch
me in Indonesia.

I got a little heat from my
bubblelicious probe but in...

other letters, smooth sailing.

And did you make...

Did you make any
disposable friends?

A couple, but no crazy night
with Ethan Hawke in Vienna...

but I still have this Moroccan
family who writes to me.

I have the best pictures of them.
Really? Then I'd love to see them.

Really?

You would?
You are so observing...

I bet you'd make a
great photographer.

Home sweet home.

I really had a great time,
Jocelyn.

Anytime Resin is indisposed,
I'll be your walking partner.

Tomorrow will be a rough day,
I've been assigned to...

Skirt's security task force to
find the Yuri.

Sounds very gums.
It really bothers me.

All this fashion espionage.

Someone just takes
our hard work...

and hand it over to Vogue.
It really pisses me off!

I'm going to make it my
mission to aprehend Yuri.

If anyone can do that,
you can.

A spy's work is never done.

Right, I really enjoyed that walk.

Good night, Jocelyn.

Sweet dreams.

I'm sorry, Jocelyn.
No big deal.

Quick, quick, quick!

I need my comb!

Fabulous, fabulous!
That, wonderful.

This is the best session!

Come on, ladies!
Embrace the water!

Embrace it!
Make love to it!

Let the water wash away
your sins, ladies!

It takes a lot more
than this rain...

to wash away their sins.

Be sexy in the rain!

Thank God!
Aleluia! Aleluia!

You know what we need?

The lightning machine.
Lightning!

Lightning machine?
Let's get out of here.

Maybe we should stick around,
get lost then start to move faster!

I'm freezing. Call me a cube.

This is unbeareable, cube.

I can't believe they're
making rain...

for the photo shoot with,
water from the Hudson river!

They're crazy! We're all gonna
get typhoid-d!

Listen, we gotta take off
these clothes.

We don't wanna get pneumonia.

Do you think they'd mind if I wore
something from the wardrobe?

No! Go for it.

It's too jay.

These things are supposed to
be worn, not framed.

I'm swimming in it!
Hang on. Where's your head?

Hang on.

That's it, that's it.
There you go.

What's that?

Hang on! Excuse me, you've
got a tag here.

I can't get it.

Where the fuck is my
eyelash collar?

I get so mad. These
stupid people...

Here it is!

We're gonna do it this time!
We're gonna...

I think maybe we should
get back out there.

We've got some time left.
They won't be finished for a while.

I'm gonna sew you out.

It's hideous out there.
I can't take it anymore.

I just walked off.

I don't feel well, Paul.

I just wanna go home
and cuddle off with you.

Okay, I'II...

I'm gonna get your car.
You're so sweet to me.

I had a great time the other day.
Me too!

I loved working with you
at the shoot.

And I think we make great
walking partners

We should consider the marathon.
Listen, Jocelyn...

I think you are amazing...

and I loved...

that walk with you as well...

and I loved hanging out
with you on the shoot...

and God only knows I'm always
so happy when I see your face...

I think we make great friends...

But...

Resin is a little pissed off because
that I see so much of you...

and I realized that...

I just hope I wasn't giving
you the wrong idea.

No. How could I forget
that you're going out...

with the "cover girl"?
Everyone else is orgasmic...

that you're going out with her.

Good, because I just wanted to...
Don't worry about it, Paul.

It's good to keep things open.
That's what I...

Here. There are many more where
these came from.

What the hell are you doing?
I was just wrapping this up...

so I can go to Carl's photo
book party.

I'll send Carls your best,
because you're not going.

You have a very important
project to do.

Have you noticed people's
desks lately?

Atrocities!
I haven't seen so many colors...

since Todd Oldham's
debut collection.

It's all about black.

What it this bullshit, anyway?

This is not Lucky Charm cereal.

This is not "Oz".

This is not "Skills".

I want you to replace
each and every one...

of these hideous five-a-dime
acessories immediately.

Everybody's desks should be in
ship-shape by tomorrow morning.

Philip's just messengered over his
new line of desk acessories.

From now on, everything
should be black.

Those bitches...

they all said:
"Brown is the new black".

I got news for you, baby:

Black...

could kick brown's ass.

Jocelyn, what are you doing
working so late?

I'm making the bulletin boards
clash-proof.

God forbid we have a stray
yellow damn tag!

I'm so sorry!
You missed a great party!

Everybody was there. I could
have stayed all night...

But Paul forgot his stupid disk
and we had to come...

all the way back uptown.
Bummer.

We won't keep you from
your work...

I'm sure it's very important.

Come on, Paul, I wanna go home.

Jocelyn, don't work
too late, will you?

You are pathetic!

What a disgrace!

You're fired.
You are over!

What are you doing? You are
stupid, you're a bad person!

You fool.

You ashamed Skirt and you're never
ever gonna work here again.

You!

A new fuse!
Look at you!

You're fabulous!
You're incredible!

The eyes, the hair, the smile!
That's it:

The new muse!

I know her
wicked ways

The parts
you never see

Our supergirl
You are our supemodel.

Although you have
a reputation

Can I afford

To abandon
my station

Mine is not the only heart
you harbor

And I love America

God!
Can she be cruel...

Hi, Joce!

What's wrong?

I just had the worst day!

I don't know how much more
of this crap I can take.

I've been there for hours,
re-acessorizing the bulletin boards.

How is the hottie?

So completely taken.

It's hopeless, Josie.
It's completely hopeless.

I'm beginning to think
I'll never get on staff...

and my summer money
is running low.

Look on the bright side:

You are the star of
public television.

They are running your
office tour again...

for the fifth time this week.
They must have it on a loop.

Come here.
I'm horrified!

Hey did you see that?

She was coming out of
the fax room.

So?

She never sends her own faxes.

What's the big deal? Maybe she had
something to do in the fax room.

So what I'm thinking.

I'm loving this tone.

Tone for a just, isn't it genious?

It's good she does LOB ingenious...

I'll have her messenger over
some for me.

Vuitton Gellys is planning a hostile
takeover of Fava.

Vuitton Gellys. I loved it.

Did you see Fendi broche bag?

I've got to have it!
It's gonna be a success.

I'll make 4 pages on it.

What's that deal with that Vogue
stealing on your stories?

I heard there was a curry.

It's Yuri, dummy, we're
talking Russians, not Indians.

It's not me. I won't work for
Vogue anymore.

They didn't airbrush me properly.

The designers are butchers.
Butchers?

Now I have my own private
airbrusher over here at Skirt.

Paul is such a sweetie!

The duke with the Macintosh.
I love working with royalty.

I love sleeping with royalty.

Who are you, the fourth Mallard sister?

Not quite, Olivier.
I don't do exiles.

I like my men underfed and overbred.

Can you give me a tiara?

Anyway, this one has
got polo fields...

and the largest private estate
in all of England.

Whores!
All of you.

Hey, man!

Do you know where
Jocelyn is?

French fries, yeah!

See'ya, Alex.
Peace.

Alex, what are you doing here?
So nice to see you!

I was dropping off some contact
sheets and I figured I'd stop by...

and say "hi". How are you doing?
Holding up?

Barely. I just about to transfer...

the Western shoot all day.
Yee-haw!

Do you wanna get some coffee?
I can sneak out of here for...

five minutes before I have to
get back to this closet.

Cool.
Let me just get my coat.

Jocelyn, I'm sorry you had to work
late. Hang in there! Paul.

John, Simmon, How sweetie!
Hello there!

How art thou?
Good, what about the Yuri?

Brutal! - Brutal...

I can't even think about it
before breakfast.

Jocelyn, you missed it!
What?

Raw brilliance!
Helmets...

helmets.
Helmut Lang?

Safety is chic.
Living is chic.

Helmut Lang.
Helmets...

for motorcycles, mopeds,
vespas and scooters, even.

To die for!
Fooffy, green tea.

We gotta make sure this trend
catches on. We gotta make sure...

this trend is covered with
pages in the magazine.

Roxanne doesn't understand this.
It's gonna be an outrage.

By this time next year, We'll
have every single woman...

wearing helmets.
Helmets on Wall Street...

helmets in the opera...

women in maternity wards
with helmets.

No more will lesbians have
a lock on helmets.

I'll see that personally.

It's great. Great.

Everybody is gonna run out
and spend 4 grand for a helmet.

It's insane, these people wouldn't
care about safety if a top...

designer didn't tell them to.
How do you deal?

A sense of humor is
essential for this job.

Richard, how are you doing?
Kenneth!

Great shoot.
Hi, Cornelia, great to see you.

Did you just see that?
Statement.

Statement? Kenneth Cole
just cut me dead.

Obviously he didn't appreciate
our dominatrix baby shoot.

Where were we... US$ 25.000,
I repeat, is not enough...

to do a piece. It's an insult
to the designer, it's an...

insult to the make-up artist, it's
an insult to the photographer...

and it's an insult to me.
Don't hurt her.

Raymond Meyer said Skirt
isn't wort his time...

if we can't put out the dough
to hang the Henry Winston...

on the gargoyles of the
Chrysler Building.

I agree with Raymond.

Can you blame him for saying that?
No.

We can't spend that much money,
not on this day...

not with this technology.

I can just superimpose them and
I Photoshop them on my Mac...

But you'd be cheating yourself
and the reader.

I don't think the reader is
really gonna know.

The reader knows.
How do I know?

Because I knew! Look, I
was raised in the trailer part...

that won't leave this table.
Oh, God!

But the point is:
I looked foward to...

getting my monthly Skirt.
I dropped off right on the trail...

to get me just a dollop
of gloss and glamour.

I needed that, so did other
millions of teenage girls...

ass-wash clad,
coming off the arcade.

We needed that. We wanted
hope and fantasy.

And we want our gargoyles real.
Yes, we want real gargoyles...

Do you understand us?
Real gargoyles!

There's my sweetie.
Hey, sweetie...

sit you cute butt down here.

She's great!

Am I interrupting something?

We are entrenched in
this serious debate...

about the importance of
investing in beauty.

Have you any thoughts?
They want to sacrifice...

their soul for some change.

Do you want to decide between
the budget and truth?

What they're saying is if there
should be caps on our shoots.

Well, I don't think that
the sky should be the limit.

But I do think that...

magazines offer an escape
in innovation and...

I hope to always hope to find
fantasy and novelty...

on the pages of Skirt.
Thank you, just as I thought.

Thank you, but fantasy doesn't
come cheap, sweetheart.

Please, I don't wanna
hear the "c" word.

Hello, darlings.
Don't you dare throw that away.

Don't you know people
are starving at Vogue?

Take it.
Jocelyn, did you finish testing...

all of the mousse in the closet?

I was almost done, I just
wanted to grab a bite.

Charmingly naive, but don't you
think problems are so important...

that you shouldn't take
time for lunch? Besides...

if you haven't noticed,
these are all editors.

Take it easy, Antoniette.

Be nice to her She's the best
intern you've ever had.

Over here!

I'm so glad you got my signal.
I really need your help.

You blew it.
They got you again.

Cock-sucking,
hussie, cocks'n pants...

I know, but I need your help. Is
there gonna be another leak?

And if so, what's story?
Think deeper, think FDR.

East River Drive,
traffic jams...

squeegee boys.
Think deeper...

think tacky blond bombshell.
Sharon Stone.

No! You fucking roadkill.
Who...

who kept wide eyes...

when she jaws?

What?

We're on a deadline and there's a
shortage of interns. Bullshit.

I have appointments and I need
someone to carry my Polaroid.

But we need her, darling.
Get Foofy.

I don't know where Foofy is.
Filing cards for upcoming shoots.

You know we only use 5 models
anyway. Are you an idiot? No!

So don't act like one.

So here is the trick for
getting free stuff:

You call Louis Vuitton,
call in 4 bags and send back 3.

The next day, call in 2 and
send back 1...

Then call in 5 and send back 4.
When they ask you to cough up...

this luggage you delay and tell
them it's on a shoot in Barbados.

Until you find somebody over
there quit, which is weekly.

And say you just sent it back
to Sheila and fake surprise...

when they say she
left the company.

No way.
Lf they keep questioning you...

tell them you messengered it over
to Vogue. An editor requested it.

That's hilarious!
Works every time. Hello, Louis V.

This soup is delicious.

It beats throwing an
acceptable layout away.

It's such a chaos over there.
This whole Yuri hassle journey...

is insane. I've had enough of
the Cold War when we did...

the "Doctor Jivago" shoot.

You got the chicken, too?
So good.

But I got the pieard.

I don't like playing with bones.

I'd bite my tongue on that one.

You are so great, Richard.
I'm so glad you work at Skirt.

Some of the people there
are so snobby.

The irony is they were all from
trailer parks and they're all on the mate.

I was on the fashion closet and I
heard Olivier and Resin talking...

what is it with Paul?
The duke?

What the hell is that?
Is he royalty or something?

Prince Chuck is his cousin or
something. You'd never know, huh?

Why do you think Resin
is going out with him?

Do you think she'd be attracted to
some guy in the art department?

But he's really cute...

and funny...

and smart...

Is it an arrow in your ass
from Cupid Squivert?

Yeah.
But it's hopeless.

Why do you say that?
Things could work out.

You never know a man's heart.
Yes, I do.

He already told me. He thinks of
me as a "great friend".

The kiss of death!

But then on the other day
he bought me fries.

He did? That's a sign.

He's so thoughtful!
I'm smitten.

I can tell!
You look green!

Is that your heart broken
to cut chips?

Somebody gets a Pepto!

Spritzer girl?
Where is the art department?

Things should be clearly
marked in these offices.

It's down there.
I'm supposed to meet Sebastian.

We're going to discuss strategies
for covering up heroine tracks.

It's so, so sad!

I know. It's terrible that these
girls do that to themselves.

It causes so much extra work
for us, matching skin tones...

blending palletes.

For arms can be quite
difficult for artists.

I can imagine, good luck!

My God, you're sick!

I think I got a full
poisoning atrophy.

I'm so sorry.

I'm horrified! I didn't want you
to see me like this.

Don't worry, it happens to everyone.

I'll get some water.

Honey, are you all right?
You got it all dripping!

I just chugged in front of Paul.
I'm gonna kill myself.

Don't worry, you'll
lose weight.

Here he comes Remember: Binding
over boyfriend is key.

Here's some water.
Great, she'll need some.

Here you go.
Thank you.

I have some mints.
I'll leave them here.

I'm okay, I just...

I gotta get back to work.
No, you go home.

I'll put you in a cab.

Here you go.

She's sick, buddy. Come on!
What the hell are you doing?

Listen. Go home, cuddle up and
get some rest.

Youve gotta take better care.
You're working too hard.

Come on.
Thank you so much, Paul.

See you on Monday on Romeo
and Juliette, okay?

Slamming into the windshield
won't win you any...

model contract.
This is Resin...

telling you to buckle up because
safety is so in fashion...

What?

I can see the dresses have
arrived for Juliette...

beautiful, sensuous, feminine.

Thanks, Dianne,
you are a goddess.

Remember, child: Life is love
and love is life.

Whining, yet charming.
New York subway in the summer.

Meteorology: 112 degrees.

Mood:

Hassled, hot, hostile, relaxed.
You're histerical.

I'm used to hanging out with
these people too long.

It catches on.
Totally.

I like to stay away from the
fashion car when I'm not working.

But it's so incestuous, everybody
is doing everybody else.

They feel like they don't get to
miss out or something like that.

It's pathetic.
Listen, I gotta get back to work...

before I get fired, but maybe we
could grab a drink after?

I'd love to, but unfortunately
my day doesn't end here.

Maybe tomorrow.
Great.

There's this cool band named
Nimbus, playing at the Rebard's...

it's like some disco, some funk,
interested?

Sounds fabulous, I'd love to.
Cool.

And definitely bring that
silly putty. I'm all over that.

Time to take your places!
I'm not ready yet.

I'm still in make up.

See, Chi Chi? I told you.
I don't work like this.

Supermodels.
I know. Attendance!

I needs standants,
standants, you...

spritzer girl.
Did I hear my name?

Go stand at the top of the balcony.
I need another.

I'll do it.
Go climb at the terrace...

and stand on the other side
of the balcony rail.

Pierre, mon cher,
we need a vision.

The year, 1323,
no... 1324.

The setting: A stony alcove
in the alps of the Capuleto...

hanging from the rocky, gelid
cliffs of Stratfordshire.

Meteorology: 50 degrees, with a
post perceptive chilling the air.

The tempest has fled to bomir
pastures, but its icy kiss lingers.

The mood:

Unbridled passion...

a passion that unravels
nature's tiring volcanoes...

and rumbling earthquakes.
This deeds are acts of gods...

so is this union.

You need to show Romeo
and Juliette how to pose.

And you can bet your
sweet ass I will.

Romeu: You've just been
running in from Mars...

you're hot and sweaty, but you're
taking some danger.

Juliette is looking hot, you know
what I'm trying to mean?

I want the body language to be
a lot more charged, okay?

So move a lot tight
closer together.

Look into your Juliette's eyes
and..."Oh! Romeo, Romeo"...

"where art thou", boy.
Come on, open your heart...

and show some love, some affection
for her. And Juliette...

you love this man!
Oh! Yes!

You know he's your knight in
shiny armor. I like that!

Hold that, I'm gonna take
some Polaroid photos.

Alex, move your ass. Move your ass.
Out, please. Move!

I like that!

I love that! Romeo e Juliette!
Romeo loves his Juliette.

Wait! What the hell
is going on here?

Resin, you'd better watch out!
We got good models over here.

I'm not worried about her
taking my job.

She couldn't even fit into
the samples.

Your hair looks like
a sheep dog...

and Juliette croaks anyway.

You thought there was something
going on when you saw that big...

drop of sweat in his hand
like Mission Impossible.

And Harnesee seemed so hot.

This is a bit bigger than
breaking into"Quantico".

You got the story from Skirt?
And hot full details!

Vogue is in Fort Knox!
Nina will be euphoric.

Man, this neighborhood is dead.

Soho used to be fly...

but now it's all just sell-out,
sell-out. Sell-out.

Then Tribeka was the e-hood,
but now it's gone to yuppies...

with their editting facilities,
waiting 45 minutes in line...

for lunch at Bubbie's.

See, it's all about the alphabet
city in the Y2K!

Paul, what are you doing here?
You remember Alex?

I need to talk to you.
Is something wrong?

I need some liquids.
What's your poison, Joce?

I'm okay.
Jocelyn, listen.

What's wrong?
What?

What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

Hanging out with that...

grunge poser.
He's beneath you!

Why do you care who I hang out with?
He's beneath you.

Let's not get started people
hanging out with people...

who is beneath them.

Are you talking about
my cover girl?

My sexy, gorgeous cover girl?
Just look at her!

Everyone else wants to sleep
with her or bathe her.

Everyone except me.
And what is that about you?

How you can see through her?

Hey, man you like this music?
Yeah, I think that's great choose.

Terrific choose, man! Yeah!

Take it easy!

You should go for Resin.

She's looking for you.

So, Resin was coming...
Oh, hi!

I assume this is finally
my iced cappucino.

Yes. And your change.
Thank you.

Geez! You really sucked
that puppy back.

Are you sure this was
skimmed milk?

No, they ran out, so
they used 2 percent.

Oh, my God!
Okay. Come on!

Oh, my God!

Come on, baby. Do it.
Do what you have to.

Okay. Here, sweetie.

My God! How dare you? I
specifically asked for skimmed...

and you bring me this fatty,
moogeous cow loyd?

I'm sorry, I'm so, so sorry,
it's just you're so thin!

Don't patronize me!

Get this out of here.
Clean it up now.

Did you get my husband
on the phone?

The hotel said he checked out.

Can't you do anything right?
Call again!

I tried three times.
Did you ask for the right name?

It's. De la Paix, I'm sure
you got it wrong.

De La Paix
It's not that hard.

I'm certain that I said it right.

The hotel specifically said
that Mr. And Mrs. De la Paix...

checked out.

Jocelyn, I'm so terribly sorry
for the way I behaved.

I'm off to London for a week.
It's my father's birthday.

I'll see you at the Return Bash.
Take care. Paul.

Thank you, Lester.

J, London's great, but I'm missing
the New York skyline.

I hope you're well.
Paul.

Fax this to Galliano's buttmaker's
boyfriend stylist...

in Monaco.

You freak!

What are those for?
We're doing a strain...

on say gal shalls and
Roxanne gave it 6 pages.

Come in.

I have to talk to you.
You want another raise?

I don't get paid, I'm an intern.

I think I might know
who the Yuri is.

Let's continue with the
pedicure later.

Privacy.

Let's talk.

Delicious!

Good morning!

Good morning, boys!

Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

Wow, are we silent!

Did somebody die here?
Yeah.

Every dog has his day...

It's obvious that, the way you two
are dressed, you're not here...

to talk to me about fashion.
I'm afraid we're not.

Lieutenant Pathmark, you're under
arrest for the insider trading...

code 327B, for industrial
espionage.

I always knew you were
the Yuri.

You have the right to
remain silent...

Yes, I did it. I wanted to make sure
these were cross-the-board trends.

I wanted to make sure if they were
pre-featured, they would come.

But you want to know
why I did it?

Because I love fashion.

Fashion is my life,
or at least...

a good portion of my day.

My dream is that every man,
woman and child in America...

will learn to spell
"Ferragamo" and...

the 5-year-olds would learn to play
hopscotch on simplicity patterns...

that words like poliester, leisure
suit and house dress...

were stricken from
our vocabularies.

If that's my crime, I'm proud
that I did it.

And if I have to go to jail...

so be it.

As long as I can take
my wardrobe with me.

Officer...

go cuff me.

Your trend-making days are over.

You can share your precious
fashion advice...

with the bitches in the slammer.

I can't wait to tell the girls
in my cell block...

"Yes! You can make stripes
with floral!"

They'll be so happy!

People, people!
I have something to say.

This has been a monumental day,
marking the end...

of a bitter and tragic era
that cast upon...

our very headquarters.

The Yuri has been aprehended!

And it's thanks to a brilliant
counter-espionage...

by a very industrious,
pro-active intern.

So let's raise our booth recall
to Jocelyn.

To Jocelyn!
To Jocelyn!

Bravo! Good eye!
Good girl!

And I have more good news:

Jocelyn is my meeting assistant...

she's on staff...

and she's our newest little Skirt.
Congratulations!

Good luck, sweetheart.

We were just messengered
the photos from the shooting...

including the Polaroids of you
and Paul, they are adorable!

I'm just dissapointed that
Paul missed my cue.

I gotta get the guy out
of my head.

I need some mental floss.
Sweetie, take a thought shower.

The important is that Editor Chief
knows your triumph...

and put you on staff.
I guess...

You're going with me to pick up
stationery from the colleaguer.

I've got to get this down to the
messenger center by 6.

I'm totally going. I'll just do a
quick e-mail and we're off.

We'll go to "II Cantenore" and...

and celebrate the end of your life
as an intern slash slave.

Hold on, I got another
call waiting...

Cornelia, have you seen Jocelyn?
Who is Jocelyn?

Pink!

The beauty is that he got a bony
campaign with Calvin Klein...

She was swallowing everything...
I'm sorry, have you seen Jocelyn?

The intern? Absolutely not!
Thank you.

Jocelyn, I hear you got to do
the Las Vegas shoot...

com Roxanne. Am I green
or what?

Oh, yeah! I'm so excited.

I see Resin found herself
a new boyfriend.

Get a room!

What about Paul?
He's over Sabrina's heels.

She swings like Tarzan,
through the vine.

I don't think that Paul chews that.

Can you believe Antoniette?

Watching her in predator
mode is better than...

Shark week on the
Discovery Channel.

Hello, whores!
There is special China Chow...

He' s probably giving some hints on
how to remain in the spotlight...

without actually doing anything.

I gotta take notes.
I think I'll follow you.

How are you doing, sweetie?

I don't know.

Kind of tired, I don't
feel so well.

I think I'll just go home and
get some sleep.

Have a drink of bourbon
it hits the head for 15 hours.

You'll be a million times better.
I'll walk you to the door.

I told her: You can have your Gucci
socks you can have your fancy title...

but really you're nothing but a
short fat Jackie O' wannabe...

with hideous feet.

There's good news and
there's bad news.

The good news is they gave
her a nice title...

Director of Special Projects.
The bad news is...

there are no special projects.
Excuse me, I have to...

Where are you going?
Let's go get a drink.

No, Antoniette, not tonight.

No hard feelings, right?

No, of course not. Look!
You make a perfect couple.

I can only imagine all those
philosofical conversations...

you would enjoy
for years to come.

Richard, please tell me
you've seen Jocelyn!

She just left, right behind
the Editor Chief.

She's in FranÃ§oise.
Right! Good!

Why did you leave? I haven't
seen all night.

Well, I wasn't having very
much fun, I guess.

Why?
I realized that...

It doesn't matter.

Resin and I have split up
I didn't love her.

And I noticed another blonde
has gone in her place.

Antoniette? Are you insane?
She's a nightmare.

She means nothing to me.
I'm standing here with you...

leaving those
phoneys behind me...

cause I'm crazy about you.

You are?
Yes

But I could never be
like them.

You don't have to be. You and I
both know how absurd it is.

You don't understand I love the
fact you're not obsessed with it.

I'm not into that bullshit, I don't
know what I was thinking before

All that glamour fades fast...

and when it's gone,
there is nothing.

I've seen who you've been with.
How could I compete with Resin.

She is gorgeous!
She is not gorgeous!

I've been so stupid.
She doesn't like French fries.

She doesn't play with that
silly putty all day long...

she doesn't make me laugh
and you know?

She would never be clever
enough to find Yuri.

How do you know about that?
Richard e-mailed me...

the whole story.
Listen...

Listen to me.
I...

Listen to me, please.
No, it's ok.

Jocelyn, listen, you are...

an updated version of the
Crocked Express...

you are the short line
of the DMD...

you are a walk around
New York in the fall...

You are funny and fun
and exciting and kind...

and beautiful. And when I went
to England I missed you.

I missed you.

I missed you so much!

Jocelyn, you have the
whole world inside you.

Hi, this is Jocelyn Bennet,
photo editor of Skirt magazine.

There are lots of beautiful
things to see in NY...

but your view can be ruined. If
you struck the head of your cab.

So buckle up!

There are lots of amazing things
that will happen in your life...

and you won't wanna miss.

And this is the kitchen.

Here is our water supply.

Most of our editors have
a preference like...

Chi Chi Chemise is
into Velvet...

Cornelia Crisp gets so upset
if there is no more "Pelegrino".

Here is the design studio...

That is Jocelyn Bennett,
the senior photo editor...

She is so nice!

Hey, Charlotte.

That was Paul, he used to work
here, now he is a famous artist.

He shows in Soho and stuff.
So ripe!

He and Jocelyn are getting
married next month.

Yoji Yamamoto is
doing her dress.

They are so cool!
I love them!

Oh! Get a room!

Can I ask you something?
What's with the angry?

I'm angry too!
