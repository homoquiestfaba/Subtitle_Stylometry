A little green monster
grows inside of me

He comes out to play when I wish
to look like she

I wanted her hair, her eyes,
her nose, her breast

I wanted to be inside her skin

A little green monster
grows inside of me

It get stronger...and stronger
when I run away from me

and she used to be someone else

I wanted her intelligence

her speed, her heart, her soul

I wanted to be admired
just like her

A little green monster
grows inside of me

Look who is here? Dembe

Look at you? As you were before.

Yeah
Good

You're going to the "masi"

I walk with you

Did you tell your mother hello 
when I can

Are you going back?

I must show you

Barry. He is good to me.

So...how have you been giving along
since I've been away?

Dembe

Need a man up

Do you think that people mess with me?

No, look at me! Look at me!

People don't care I'm gay
cause I'm my own man

Here, take this

I'm down hope here

Dembe

Oh, Ojore, oh my dear

Look at you

That's a true man, young man.

Look at him Dembe

Omi, you must stay for dinner.

Eh...I'm sorry Namazzi, I cannot
I eat with my mother

Oh yes...
I was walking Dembe home

It was nice to catch him
And where was he?

You always come home
with so much sun

Go and wash up. Now that you are
home we can have dinner

You must take this to your mother

Oh...no, no Namazzi, I cannot.

Let me give you something.
No, no!!

I wanted her intelligence

her heart, her soul

Bye, Dembe

Bye

Omi...

Thank you.

A little green monster
grows inside of me

It get stronger and stronger
when I run away from me

She used to be someone else

I wanted her intelligence

her speed, her heart, her soul

I wanted to be admired
just like her

A little green monster
grows inside of me

The promise is to expire
when I'll learn to smile in my reflexion

even while rend the flesh of a man

a woman cannot be herself

Where do you go
when you're all in your head?

What is this?

What did I tell you
about shrouding?

You can't tell them
That's right. Now tell me

Poetry

Poetry about what?

Everything that I am

Poetry is not what a man does, Dembe

I need you to be a man for me
and help

I don't want to

I don't want to be a man

Don't you start with me today

If you father was here
you will be gone all day

and that's it,  there is so much to be done

Boy!
I'm not a boy

You are not a boy?
But you're not a man.

So what are you? Eh?

I am...

I wanted her intelligence

her speed, her heart, her soul

I wanted to be just like her.
