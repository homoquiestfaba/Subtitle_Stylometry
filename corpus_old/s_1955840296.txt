I have become death,
the destroyer of worlds.

After the failed invasion
Nephilim of the mid-21st century

The victorious humanity
it expanded throughout the galaxy.

By the end of the 22nd century, humanity
I had divided into two different species.

The Homo Sapiens and the
genetically superior ...

... Homo Technicus. Also
known as the Construct.

With the passage of each generation the
homo sapiens were decreasing.

Until in the year 2820, only one
a handful of human colonies survived.

Humanity's End

New Shanghai
Capital of Pleiades.

They are too many!
Resist!

Shit!

Contact Sheetak

Look to see if there is someone
and to evacuate!

We have to raise the alarm.

Find those who remain and get out of here!

Contact the Blue Whale!

We have to evacuate.
Right now?

That's an order.
We have to go out into space.

Orion 2
Repair Station.

It was seven years ago.

When we were under
the command of the Konstrukts ...

went to his museum,
there was an auction ...

but nobody bought anything.

That's when I saw Blue Whale.

She was lying on the side.

I'm surprised there was a
auction of old reliquaries.

Nobody cares about that old ship
which is behind the museum.

In addition everyone wants to make money.

I decided to stay with her.

How old are you?

I do not know. I guess 10,000 years.

But inside is a
Virgin on her honeymoon.

They already gave me the tour,
It smelled pretty bad.

We are doing a total repair.

First the engines,
then the interior.

I was thinking about
a beautiful decoration.

I had never seen that in
a running ship.

Yes, without mentioning
military torpedoes.

Yes.

Also taken from the PDD,
on the 28th and 22nd ...

She will be the fastest ship ...
in the sector!

Nothing of Vera.
This is the great moment!

Captain.
Do not do that.

Transmission of Konstrukt 3.
I'm fishing.

Why are you fishing?

It's the stupidest question
what have they done to me all day?

You were supposed to be in
Konstrukt 3 this morning.

What is the trouble?
Just keep waiting.

What's inside the package
is what interests us.

Well, you'll have them when you have them.
Agree?

So, three days.

But if they pay more money,
and buy more fuel ...

they will have it faster.

Roj, did you ever let that
Your crotch will be stocked?

You mean sex?
You should try it sometime.

It would be good for you.
It will relax you a little.

You know, put it in mmm.

When will we receive the merchandise?
In two days.

Putos contructores!

Derasi, I finished the repair.

It was already time.
Let's get out of here.

There are no fish here.
I did not catch anything all day.

You're done?
I'm connecting the injectors.

Blue?
He only touched them by arribita.

I should see how it was.

It is the only mechanic in 60 light years.

Mira gets a bit of a fool,
because he is only happy when he pilots.

Yes, I know his bad mood.

And the attacks?
I do not care.

They destroyed three human worlds.

<i> There are always wars somewhere. Has
the final verifications and let's go. </ i></i>

I heard it was Nathalon.
Who?

Another hybrid human.

They added alien DNA to
his system. It's very dangerous.

They are classified as Homo-superior.

I'm not interested in politics
nor the hybrids.

Maybe you should do it.
To the captain bridge.

That seems like an order.
I'm sorry, captain.

What did you call me?

Captain.

Yes, I am the captain,
I give the orders ...

and you obey them.
You...

I know you want to look good
in front of your clone friends,

but on this ship ...
It's Sheetak.

It's urgent, he says he needs ...

Very good.
Why did not you take her to my cabin?

And you, make sure you check
the cables before you leave.

Derasi?
Sheetak, did you miss me?

This is not the moment.

I heard about the crisis.

I have something to tell you.

Where are you?
In Pleiades 5.

A sperm bank?

You left me because you did not want children
and you're in the damn sperm bank.

...to the humans.
They have vaporized everyone.

What are you flying?
An elliptical tank.

First you have to confuse them.

I need you Derasi.
Sheetak.

We're going to the Pleiades system.

But we have to go to ...
She needs us.

Are you ready Blue?
Starting the engines.

Sublighted engines.

Hello?
Does anyone listen to me?

Curse.

387 is a hero.

Pleiades NMR system.

25 light years in 20 minutes.
Your best time Blue.

What's going on?!
You're still here?

I was checking your cables
when you started the engines

Why did not you tell anyone?

Because it is the central core.
I could have fried there.

I doubt it.
Increase speed.

Where is my ship?

I guess next to the reactor.

Blue?
Yes, it's still there.

It's right in front.

This would never happen in
a ship of the fleet.

Calm and active
communications.

You took your time.
Better late than never.

I'm on my way to NMR, I need your help.

Where is the head of the fleet?

They are gone.

Where did they go?
They died.

Something big is coming.
They came back.

Leave everything you have
and get out of there.

I have no chance.
Ships are approaching.

General, we have company.

I'll open fire.
Copied. Watch out!

I'm falling.
Load the Blue torpedoes.

Which?
The illegals.

What?
Armed torpedoes.

Greet me to Jesus.

The torpedoes are illegal ...
I do not see any police around here.

Turning on
leveling impellers.

Take that!

I'm here.
There are two more.

It was everything we had.
Start praying.

I am already praying.

State.

Low atmosphere. Y
one more pursues us.

Let's go there.
No way.

Yes.
I will not leave the load.

And your ship?
Is small.

Can we land?
Not fast enough.

Rewrite.
You promised me Derasi ...

I'm sorry, baby
Let's go there.

Derasi connect me again.

Did you understand?

Leave that here.

Do not shoot unless you're sure.
It is understood.

Aim well.
Yes. I will not fail.

Shut up.

There is no sign of these things.

What a bad smell.
Yes, it smells like a cabin.

This was the ocean.
Do you think you're a professor?

If I were a captain I would move away
as soon as possible from here.

You are not a captain so
do not try to think

I do not like...
You know what?

I'm sorry captain, I'm going to shut up
and I will do what they tell me,

Because I do not know how to do anything else!

I found them.
All right.

They answered your prayers.

Come on, shoot now!

I saw what you did.
What?

You signed me up
x

You signed me up!

Clones.
They are not human.

They are ugly.
And you too.

Do not shoot,
we are humans!

He does not.

Sorgon 387.
Clone released.

They thought they were exterminated.

They found a hiding place
in Vera.

It is not a hiding place if you
You say it to the whole world.

Take my hands off my coat.

So ... where is Sheetak?

The pilotaba that was in the area.

The ship is overheated.

Start the engines.
Wait 30 seconds.

Rewrite.
Try turning on the motors.

Are you upset?
Enters.

It had been 7 years since you saw her.

Yes.

I know that...
What the fuck do you know ?!

Half of the fleet is
at our disposal,

but our people will not serve
next to your drones ...

The Konstrukts are not easy
to dominate like the homo-sapiens.

If we continue acting
on the margin of our ...

... advice, our fleet
and technology will be removed.

You require modification
genetics. The violence...


 s ... animal is an insult
to your Nephilistic wound.

What happened?

I am...

Idiot, take the schoolgirl out
from here.

My name is Alicia.

How?
Alicia.

Breeder of class A, Alicia.

Take her to the ship.

He is...
I have to ask.

They castrated him from birth.

Do not think about sex.

Come on Mr. Twinkle,
I can not leave you behind.

I had seen other breeders,

but she seems more capable.

I'm glad you're here.

Junior Frietag.
Derasi Vorde.

He was a pilot of ... you know.

Does the Derasi Vorde of the
offensive of Pleiades?

Look, that was a long time ago.

PediCrime's life changed
after your Martial Cut.

Look, I do not ...

That offensive was just a massacre!

Well, we all make old mistakes.

You're smart.

You live there, do not you?
7 years ago.

There are no humans there.

Do you know anything about the other colonies?
There are no other colonies.

Yes, good...
There is none left.

Not even one.

They used bio-robots to infiltrate.

They had been there for years.

And they gave the signal.

We could not even form a fleet.

Everything disappeared in a matter of days.

There must be someone
in some place. I'm here.

We search for months.
Pleiades is dead.

Not the least trace.

Well, the Konstrukts will have rescued
to some to take them home.

They must be safe.

Our technical friends formed
an alliance with the Nephilim.

You go there and you will be executed.

I have a contract
2. 3. 4

So I have some protection.

Listen to me, boy

The Nephilim date from
millions of years ago...

just like the Konstrukts,
They want us all dead.

It is not so strong general.

You ... and I are the last
men in the galaxy.

There is not much left of you.

But Alici ...
is his daughter?

She is the last one we have left.

How disgusting ...

that a man of your ilk
Put your hands on it.

If you and she ...

maybe...
He's hallucinating.

They have no other option
than having a child

First we fight and then ...

There's nothing left.

The military fell first.

You, regroup and hide.

There is a military secret,
on the planet Mars.

All illegal weapons
of the War of Liberation.

I have two rules in my life.

I do not go out with stupid girls
with super developed ovaries,

and I'm not going to prohibited areas
of radiation.

You know what's good for you
Yes

So listen.

The human race is exhausted.

Nothing remains.
Does not exist.

You are all that remains.

General?

World Konstrukt.

We welcome you to
our empire Nehilim.

We welcome you under
the Empire of Nephilim.

We recognize your responsibility with
our DNA, now we will be a single race!

The Homo-Sapien DNA has been
exorcised from our universe.

Soon immortality will be ours,
as it was before the Lords Nephilim.

Our alliance with
your ridiculous people are ...

... based on you deliver
the DNA code.

We have dispatched a small fleet to
Collect it from your remote location.

The genocide of the Homos-sapiens
changed the course of our plans.

We do not tolerate criticism
to our policy.

Make the delivery as you promised
or we will burn the planet.

We are Homo-technis, and I do not know
It can intimidate us with violence.

Is everyone dead?

That's what the general said.

But there are colonies and seasons
throughout the galaxy.

Well, they found the
way to penetrate them.

The question is:

Why are we still alive?

You were hiding
on the most remote planet ...

out of space.

Well, I'm not going to hide anymore.

Damn Konstrukts!
Move Blue!

They do not come so fast.
Why do not they shoot us?

We carry a load that interests them.

I'm going to release her.
Hurry up.

Ready?
Yes captain.

Drop the load.

Put the course to NMR.
No way!

Do it!
Do not you dare!

The regulators ...
It's not in your control.

They already go twice.

You are making me angry.

Regulators 3 and 4
They are overloaded.

Stabilizes Blue.
With what?

Where?
Anywhere!

Loving You.
Not there!

Come on!
We are on our way!

That was very fair!
Fair?

For the love of God Derasi.
Let's go back to NMR.

Do not fuck Captain.
Fix the regulators.

I'm not a member of your crew.

Yes now.

How are you going Blue?

As I am, we will not get far.
Motin?

The injectors do not work
and the regulators are failing.

Good thing you have
to your mechanic on board.

Markus was the mechanic
and he knew it.

You are nobody...
Yes, we understand you.

How lucky she is here.
Excuse me

I need new injectors.

If we stop at the Finian station
I will give you what you need.

Do you think it's OK?

Everything is fine.

Next time I will have a
crew of men.

I searched for all human frequencies.

Only this is transmitted.

I hate that sound.

What does that mean?

They say that the DNA code of
Homo sapiens has been eliminated.

And that the Empire of Nephilim reigns.

The Homo-technis, the Homo-superiors,

the Konstrukts and the Bio-Clons,

must report to the local barracks

to be registered
in the new regime.

Are we just them and us?
Yes

And Derasi?
Yes

To 4 days of Pleiades and not a whisper
in no frequency.

The odds of
Eating a hamburger are few.

I wish I was happier here.

We see ships Konstrukts in the distance.

We are one day away from Mars.

I hope you have a good hamburger.

Or at least a good
place to fish.

Why is it so cold on this ship?

All ships with well.
Have you been to space before?

I never left Pleiades 5.

It's hotter there, on the beach.

Yes.
Sit down.

How much did you know Sheetak?

She was the head of the program.

Did you ever talk about me?
Surely yes.
3. 4. 5

Never.

But he talked a lot about Freddie.

Why, you and her ...
Yes. 18 months.

Well, you do not look like your type.

Yes, I suppose not.

Why did you want to be a breeder?

Do you like sex very much?
I've never done.

The goal was to prepare ...

to restore the human population.

Well, I've been out for a while now.

Well, a disease was
affecting the ovaries.

Mine work so ...

I was happy to be in the program.

Finian Station.
Military deposit.

There was a mass.
You threw her?

I left a part in the station.

Put me with Derasi.
Its busy.

It has been some time,
I hope to be at height.

I need to know your story.

My father was military.

He forced me to do many things ...

Your medical history

Well, he broke three bones
When I was 12 years old.

I'm not supposed to touch
to anyone who is less than 90.

Well, I'm 39 years old.

Very disgusting.

Are you my mom?

What happened?

My mom left.

How long have you been here?

Would you be my mom?

I would love to be your mom.

Only one robot!
It was a damn robot!

Would you like to be my...

I'm ovulating.
I also.

Open the Blue doors.

I'm sorry, Contessa, I can not do that.

Open the damn Blue doors!

Open doors.

It's my first time.
I am a virgin.

It's my first time...

with a virgin.

I am sorry.

That is nice.

Oh God.
Yes!

I was absent for a while.

This is strange to me.

I ended up with Sheetak,

or she finished with me I ...

She did not want to have a family.

I do not remember.
You wanted this

And I do not know, I'm ready
to have a family.

I want, but not so fast.

I want to know you better.

She left 10 minutes ago.

I know.

Did you find anything at the station?

What's wrong with me?

You find me attractive, do not you?

Since I knew you, you were
Married to Markus.

Markus was older than me and ...

We both miss him.

I like to feel loved.

It's okay.

Markus told me about the days
of forced attacks.

That was 20 years ago.

Did Markus ever take you fishing?

Yes, in the winter of 2833.
It was spectacular.

I went in 2824.
I caught one 25.7 kilos.

28 kilos?

Your arms are very thin.
You are skin and bones.

Do you like Derasi?

You are one of ours

And I have a girlfriend.

Besides, I'm just sperm.

Did you hear that?

It's like that Derasi,
a disaster.

Tell him the truth

I will never tell you.

That is my rule.

Shit!

Nothing good.
Open fire.

With what?

Your present.
Are you crazy?!

Send me out there and I can
make some holes.

Inbound transmission

There is a reason why
they do not use this anymore

Why do they work?
I said:Incoming transmission.

I had some of these in my hands ...

and they tend to ... explode
before using them

What do I answer?

Ask for the hamburger recipe!
I do not give a fuck!

Onscreen.

Captain, you have orders
to surrender and ...

Why do you follow me?
Go away!

The whole galaxy is looking for you.

We just want to put an end to it.

What if I give you a deposit bag?
Will that make you feel better?

He has no weapons aboard the ship.

Yes, we are faster than you.

The desire of Kons ...

Why do not you feel about this
and you shake your pig?

Do what she says captain.

Is he one of you?
It does not leave me another option.

You and them.

5 years of service,
And so you pay me?

Shut up!

Master pig!
Monkey brain!

You are in this together,
What do you want from me?

Our stolen ship.

We believe that the corpses contain
the DNA of an ancient Lord Nephilim.

They need this
to be immortal.

They will share it with us.
You're a fucking puppet.

Do it.

Let it go!

Turn off the screen

You know what?

You have to learn to respect
to your captain

Thank you.

Moron!

You had the opportunity to live well.
And you threw her overboard!

My brothers and sisters
They do not have to die.

Yes, that's why you should have stayed
in your position.

Damn slave!

I brought you out of nowhere!

And I made you my first boss!
Second.

Second!

You treated me like
to a pet, sir!

Do you want to be a captain?

You wanna be?

This is your chance.

Captain of an escape pod.

I'm sorry, captain.

Are we still headed to Mars?

We have no other option.

They go to a place called Mars.

What's on Mars?

A human colony, weapons.

Maybe an army.

It seems unlikely.

The whole system is full
of radiation.

We will stay for a few weeks.

We will fish, we will look for some weapons.

And then we go to war.

The planet Earth was
destroyed years ago.

There can not be anything in that system.

Follow them until the fleet arrives.

Threatened 387 with
a nuclear weapon?

Hi.
Where were you?

I was tired.

I do not like this, captain we're
releasing plasma from the starter motor.

Why do not you try to stop the leak?

You are not working?

They follow us.
They are more than 18.

Must be more aggressive

Is it true what they say
of my processor?

No, it's envy of ships.

You are still the bitch more
speed of the galaxy.

Derasi?
What?

Can I talk to you in private?

After.
Not now!

Wait for me!

If we destroy the ship
we lose everything.

Our fleet will arrive soon.

Your starter motor is weak.

We only hit a fraction
and the helmet can be broken.

It will be slow, we can reach it quickly.

We destroy it and destroy your planet.

Look, if you have a rash or something ...

it was not me because
I'm clean".

In addition there is no where to choose.

Probably the only one in existence.

It does not taste like beer.

Yes, I did it myself.
Go.

Yes. Last night she was a little mobile.

Well, really, I expected a little more.

Fireworks.

Now you have some.

I just do not feel it with you.

Yes, you felt something.

Look, all that kissing
as if you were my boyfriend.

It was not for that that I entered the program.
Let's try it again.

I have a sample of your sperm.

We no longer need to have more sex.

I have samples of ovaries
and Sheetak's eggs.

I can make some links
and do different things.

We need that for a healthy child.

Can you clone Sheetak?
Yes

Not without an installation
to make clones.

There is none of those near.

Partner, she went ahead.

Baby.

Contessa looks at you a lot.
Do not start with that.

She is beautiful.

You and her...
Do not.

Is it your sister or something?

She is married to my mechanic.

I was.

He died.

Is a ghost watching you?

I am going to tell you something.

You can not tell anyone,
You swear?

I swear.

She is a robot.

What?!

Yes, it was a model of pleasure
and reprogrammed it.

She thinks she is human.

We programmed her to fall in love ...

and have a serious relationship.

What are you doing out there?

Long distance pumps.

Does Blue always hear what you are talking about?

How about?

She was looking when we were ...

The lights were off
but I heard everything.

All. So Derasi.

Slowly.
Very fast.

It is funny.

You remind me of someone.

She is not a normal AI.

Strange.

You used a famous profile, right?

Where did you find it?

In a Konstrukt museum.

You stole it, do not you?

I like the personality.

But I had to erase his story.

You know, change it.

Did you do what ...
Nothing.

What happened to my personality?

Well, you know ...

You were very dominant.

How much did you erase?

Look, you were just a hole,

and a micro-processor,
They did not use you thousands of years ago.

You're lucky that I put
to work again.

What personality did you use?

This is good.
For.

I ... I used Sheetak's personality.

I knew it!
She?!

I had some memories
of happy moments.

Do not tell me.

I thought if I merged them ...

You fused my personality
with hers

You evolved distinctly.

Wait a minute.

If she is so old,

So it was a Nephilim ship?

Probably.

That's fine, maybe I should
Do not join my family.

What are you doing out there?

They are shooting at you
to my starter.

Shit.

Come on Derasi.
Time to be sober.

Blue, keep up the speed.

We are 100%
and they are approaching.

What can we throw at them?
We can launch an engine.

No way.

The boot does not work.

We put an injector
that explodes when it is close.

Sparkly Let's do it.

They will not resist.
Go do that.

We almost have them.

What do they do?
It worked.

No. I know the captain
and his way of acting.

Activate the magnets.

They are already on.

It's a bomb!
Shoot!

Shield connected.

State.

Helmet destroyed.

The engine does not work.

We are not going anywhere.

Do what you have to do
but get close to them.

Very impressive captain.
Send to others.

Que?
They will tell us where they land.

Well, we'll land shortly.
I already want to be down there.

It's a personal ship, is not it?

You will be safe there.

Any order before landing?
Stay hidden.

You carry a part of me inside.

Captain...
Come on.

We're wasting time.

We are approaching the place.

You're good?
Yes

There are no places to fish.

Find a place to land Blue.
Scanning.

You're a nuisance miss.
How important was it for them?

For the Konstrukts?

They had you in a museum.

You were unconscious and
You were alone for thousands of years.

You did not have anyone to talk to.

You were alone.

You could not move.

He was who he was.
You were not like that, Blue.

And you're not shit,
You are unique, special.

You know it, do not you?

I know, and you?

Hold on tight.

They landed?
It looks like it is.

That's not good.

There are many.

Are we going to land soon?

I can not stay here.

Why did you become a breeder?

I could not get a
work in the nucleus.

And I wanted to leave my house.

For how many babies did you sign?

It can reach up to 10
but I signed for 5.

The pay was almost the same.

Maybe I enjoy it,

but now...

You are about to be pregnant.

I've never been with a man before.
Y?

He is not...
that's not what I expected.

Here I have sample of
the best men.

And Derasi is ...
Common?

Well not yet.

You like it right?

Curse!

My husband...

He died a short time ago
and I'm recovering.

Can we land now?

Listen to my story
Your history?

It is funny.

What do you want from life?

I want to be with a man
that loves me ...

and have a family.

Que?
Curse!

You should not have said that.

I can say what I want.

You have to...
What are you talking about Alicia ?!

You are...

You are a damn robot.

What?!

You are a model of pleasure.

Your ex-husband reprogrammed you for
that you thought you were human

No, I'm sure I'm human.

Everyone on the ship knows
that you are a robot ...

except you.

You just think you're human.

You can not have children

If I can.

I have my periods,
I bleed and I have pains.

I have cramps.

A bio-robot.

Designed to imitate humans
in every sense.

That is the point.

Derasi told me.

That's why he does not want anything with you.

But I...

Where is the military depot?
-20 miles to the east.

How is the air?

Something changed with
respect years ...

... previous but what
you will find little dense

This was a good gift.

Be carefull with that.
Yes mom.

Derasi?
What?!

Come back soon.

In Pleiades there were beaches
everywhere.

There is not much land.

Shallow waters.

Open spaces.

The water scares me.

Do you love me Mr. Twinkle?

That was the last one.

Mr. Twinkle has five
of our best minds.

Do you want to be in love?

Maybe it's programmed that way.

My emotions do not exist.

Why did he make me ... feel?

Why did he make me love things?

Why?

Why?

I want...

What is that?

Return with the weapons.
I will do what i can.

I love this.

They're here.

Can you see us?
Of course.

They are not going to stop.

Why do they do this?

Damn Nephilim.

Are they going to hit us from behind?

They have more important goals.

Hello son.
I'm not your son.

387.
It was.

You are still a slave.

What generation?
G-7.

Three hearts, bio-plasma skin,

double layer of Creniun.

Do you know him?
The genetics program.

We were in all the colonies.

I had three masters for
When I was 12 years old.

Until the captain bought me.

And one day the captain released me.

He made me his second.

I've paid.

Who is the first of you?

Some time ago we know
of his illegal colony.

If they had stolen ships ...

we would have occupied them.

I have done things of which
I regret.

The captain deserved a lot of this.

I read "The prohibited saga
of humanity. "

It is punished with my death.

The humans and the Konstrukts were
once the same spice on Earth.

It was a human doctor, Hatcher,

he had the dream of seeing
evolve to Homo-sapiens.

They programmed me so that
I would worry about those things.

Nephilim hoped there would be less
humans before the genocide began.

I have doubts as to whether
they will keep their promises ...

about sharing immortality.

Do you think they will turn against you?

I want to kill the Nephilim
that is on board,

and look for another way.

It's better than I thought.

Yes.

What do we do?

Restart the engines.

How?

I will do it manually.

We will go more slowly, but
We have to try.

I have a surprise for you, Blue.
Derasi!

Go back, lady.

I'm a fucking robot!
What?!

I'm sorry...

You knew all the time
And you did not tell me anything!

It's okay, you're just a robot.

Let it go!

At least I have a body.

If I kill you with the force of a robot,

it would not be murder
because I do not have a soul

You were happy and
I needed you on the ship ...

so...
Fuck you!

I had fantasies with you!
Really?

To have a child with you and everything.

What happened to that?
Why did you not tell me?! Why?

Markus asked me not to tell you.

I wanted to be with you!
Everyone wanted to be with you!

Markus was your husband.
If I slept with you ...

You would like to be pregnant and then ...
And after that?

You would not have made the robot happy!

May God save me from doing
happy to a robot.

You already pregnant your reproductive!

That was before she ...

There is another ship on the way.

We have enough weapons so ...

You will need more than that.

Fix me the ship.

Por favor.
That's an order?

Yes.

If I do not do it
we all die, right?

Yes, that is the plan.

Why should I care ?!

I'm just a machine without feelings!

Trust me, you have feelings.

They're here.

If you had put me an engine
again we would not have this problem.

Did you know I'm a robot?
Everybody knows.

You could have told me.

If it were you I would have noticed.

This is your heart and your soul
I can finish you.

I slip something and ...

You can do that, but
You will live with guilt.

Do you think your feelings
are real?

Of course yes.

We are not very different
to the humans.

You have your DNA and you
biological programming.

You excel in mind
and you have a body.

You can do things with your feelings.

Target the target.
Do not shoot like crazy.

I already killed three.
You can not fail!

You will see!

Very impressive.

I will finish with these
You fucking sons of bitches.

Leave them!
Come on.

I want to do this!

They have to pay!

What a pity you do not show
this in bed.

Close the door!

There is no energy Derasi.
Contessa is working.

Give me a gun!

How long?
A few minutes for the restart.

I can not promise you that
just minutes

Can you load a couple of missiles?

I do it
Back off.

Take Alice to the cave.
It is 20 miles to the east.

That way you'll be safe.
There will be a few explosions.

Come on, move!
I need a few minutes.

They keep coming.
Empty.

Close the doors!

Come on, Blue!
I do not have energy!

You, humans, took us away
of our immortality.

Your species must die.

You guys are ugly.

I'm sorry, Derasi,
I do everything I can.

Stay here and you will be safe.

I am safe.
I'm not a robot.

It's okay.

They are in my central core!
What I do?!

Stop them!

Derasi I ...

Blue?

Talk to me Blue!

I will be on the bridge.

Get off the ship.

Do you want to die now?

You are a race of cowards.

Many Konstrukts are alive
for my cowardice.

But there were mejroes
ways of doing it

I want to see them dead as much as you.

The strategy of catching the fish.

It's not just patience, it's the strategy
against the fish. And then catch him.

First you have to
attract him to the hook.

Then make sure
of having caught him.

You have to make sure of that
before taking it out.

Remember that.

So shall.

I'm too young to have a baby.

I also.

Your ship is in good hands.
Yes cool!

Is Blue okay?
I'm sorry, captain.

The central core is fine ...

but we could not connect it to the ship.

Contessa says ...
What did you find in the cave?

We found a missile deposit.

It's out there, dealing with
the rest of the Nephilim.

She has a big heart.

Objective at 28-7.
Load. Fire.

It would be better if you come back.

I wish I had ... you know ...

I would have liked...

It hurts.

Hopefully...

Blue?

It is trapped in the glass.

Your conscience is still alive.

Find the way to ...

With the loss of your fleet,

the Nephilim Empire was left without control.

The progeny of Homo sapiens
continued for years.

A geneticist Konstrukt, used the collection
of ovaries from Alice for ...

make a clone of Sheetak.

We thought it would be good
for Blue's conscience.

Derasi would be pleased.

We travel two galaxies before
that we found a new home.

8 births for the new humanity.

Where do I update?
There and there.

Explain to me because I have to do it.

You have to touch these three ...
Do not touch.

Alicia discovered her true calling,

after giving birth to 5 children
to take care of them

She never returned to our world.

But I always assumed that it helped
to overthrow the Nephilim Empire ...

because in a few decades
they were all dead.

The sperm sample that Alicia had
He gave me a beautiful son.

She never told me the identity
of the donor.

But I know it was Derasi.

Our home has changed.

And fishing is our way
of survive.

We are happy here.

A part of me misses Derasi.

He made many mistakes,
but he was a man ...

and lived as a man should live.

I hope my son grows
and do not look like his father.

But sometimes I wait
that is equal to him.

I have become alive,
the creator of worlds.

I am a machine and I have a soul.
