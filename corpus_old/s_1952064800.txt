Hi.

Do you have by any chance a guest
under the name of Mrs. Lazar?

Lazar?

Dori Lazar.

I don't think so.

Are you sure?

Let me check for you.

Yes, check it out, please.

No sir, we don't have a guest
under that name.

Dori!

Dori!

Dori, don't do it! No!

"RETURN FROM INDIA"

Close him up.

Dr. Rubin, come with me please,

Lazar from administration
wants to see you.

Subtitles by:
Elrom Studios

Can we wake him up?

Lazar, this is Dr. Ben Rubin,
the ideal man for the job.

Nice to meet you. Have you
been an intern here for long?

For 12 months, in surgery.

Have a seat. - Thank you.

Don't we need someone from internal
medicine, Prof. Hissin?

Although Dr. Rubin desperately
wants to be a surgeon,

If you ask me, he was born
to be in internal medicine.

Nevertheless, I hope you
let me stay in surgery.

Dr. Rubin, have you
ever been to India?

India? - Yes.

We need a doctor to go there
and examine a sick young woman.

She's very ill and we need
a doctor to bring her home.

What's wrong with her?
Hepatitis B, most likely.

When am I supposed to leave?
Immediately.

We'll go as soon as the shots
and visas are in order.

What do you mean "we"?
I'm going as well.

It's my daughter, Einat.

Her friend got back yesterday
and said it's getting worse.

Will you do it?

I'll think about it.

Good evening, Dr. Rubin.
Good evening.

Come in, make yourself
at home. - Thank you.

I called you earlier
but you weren't in.

I thought it over, Mr. Lazar...
Call me Abe. - OK, Abe.

I hope your passport hasn't
expired. - No, it hasn't,

but about the trip... - This is
Michaela, my daughter's friend.

She got back from
India two days ago

and told us everything
that's happened.

Michaela, meet Dr. Rubin,
who's going with us.

Nice to meet you.
Hi, hi.

Ben. - Michaela.

So you were with her
when she got sick?

Yes. I'm no expert...
It's OK.

She looks really ill.
What did you see?

Her skin turned yellow,
she lost a lot of weight.

Her urine looks like tea,
it's so dark,

and her body is covered with
scratching bruises.

She's really ill.

Michaela brought maps. Come
see where we're taking you.

Einat is here in Gaya,

a holy place, that has
something to do with Buddha.

She's in a hospital there,
or what they call a hospital.

Don't mind him, Dr. Rubin.
India is an amazing country.

I'm sure it's fascinating.

However, regarding the trip,
I simply can't go.

This is my wife.

Dori, this is Dr. Rubin.

How do you do.

We're very happy you're
joining us, Dr. Rubin.

My wife is going with us.
Is that OK? - Yes...

It's none of my business.
The more the merrier.

Yes, it's OK.

Please, Sit down.

We'll fly to Bombay, then
take a train to Varanasi

and from there to Gaya.
Hey, give him a minute.

Look, it's a very
flattering offer,

but I only have a month left to
finish my cardiology internship.

I thought you were transferring
to the internal ward.

Isn't that was Hissin said?

Hissin can say
whatever he likes.

I'm not leaving surgery.
If it's not at your hospital,

there are other hospital,
it's not the end of the world.

Why don't you bring us
a drink, maybe some wine.

I'll help.

I understand your dilemma,
try to understand our distress.

We must bring Einat home.

Dr. Hissin says you're
the ideal man for it.

We'll pay you generously.
Money's not the issue.

What's so great about me?

That's the third time
I've heard it today.

Believe it or not,
Hissin likes you.

Yet he doesn't want me
in his ward.

Can I show you her picture?
Yes, please.

Our only daughter.

How old is she? - 20.

She's very pretty.
She's very ill.

Good morning, Dr. Rubin,
This is Dori Lazar,

I have the tickets. Don't forget
to bring the shots.

We leave at 8 o'clock,
we'll be waiting for you. Bye.

Are you sure about going
to India, Mrs. Lazar?

Didn't we just buy 3 tickets?

By the way,
my name is Dori.

That one was for typhus,

The next one is
for meningitis.

May I have your other arm,
Mrs. Lazar?

I hope I didn't hurt you,
Mrs. Lazar.

I hope you'll call me Dori.

OK, Dori.

Ben!

Abe, why do we have to
stay in Bombay?

Honey, it's 2000 km to Gaya.

We have to make a stop
at Varanasi.

Then let's go to Varanasi.
But we missed the flight.

We'll never make it to Einat.

There's a train to Varanasi
at 8AM, but it takes 20 hours.

We'll have to find a hotel.

Do you know a good hotel
in town?

Not a tourist,
just a local hotel, alright?

I'll take the other rickshaw.

I hope we don't lose
each other in this crowd.

Look, Abe. Wow!

What a sight!

This must be the hotel.
Are you crazy?

If this is the hotel,
I'm not staying here.

You wanted a local hotel.

Let's see if they have
any rooms available.

Come on, come on.

All those children,
The heat...

Welcome to Golden Hotel.
What can I do for you?

You could really save us.

Yes, we need two rooms for
one night, please.

You have reservations? - No.

Sorry, it's full,
tourist season.

But wait, we have one room,
very small, it's upstairs.

Could you please show us
the room?

Bell boy will show you up.

What about Ben?

It's just for one night.
What could happen?

Abe, look. It's amazing.
The world's largest launderette.

You amaze me, Dori.
Do you love me? - Yes.

What's the matter,
is something wrong?

No. Why? - The way
you were looking at us...

I don't remember ever seeing
my parents like that.

Like what?

A couple of teenagers in love.
We are teenagers in love.

Ok, we'll take the room.

What about Ben?
Will we all share one bed?

Can we have another extra bed?
A cot will do.

Yeah, and some sort of screen,
please.

I will ask the manager, Mam.

Thank you,
thank you very much.

Don't worry Ben,
We'll be very quiet.

No problem.

Hi, Ben. - Hi.

Where were you?
Sightseeing. Did I wake you?

No, nothing can wake Abe.

I can't sleep,
I'm worried about Einat.

What did you see?

A market, a famous temple,
hanging gardens.

Millions of people
sleeping in the streets.

Interesting? - Sad.

I'm very tired,
I want to get some sleep.

Good night, Ben.
Good night.

Abe.

Dori, stop it,
We're not alone.

I'm so worried,
How can you sleep?

Hi. - Hello.

Are you on tour
to our country?

Not exactly, we have come to bring
our daughter back home.

She is very ill.

Oh, this is my wife,
this is Dr. Rubin.

Hi.

Oh, I'm also a pysician.

Really? Perhaps your are familiar
with a hospital in Gaya,

by any chance?
I am actually.

Is it a good hospital?
What's your daughter's problem?

Hepatitis B, apparently.
Oh my goodness.

Seems there is some complication
and secondary infection.

In that case may I suggest
that you contact the lab hospital.

But Gaya is not so bad.

As long as they have a good lab,
can we trust the results?

Well I would suggest that
you contact the lab in Vernasi.

If you need my help,
contact me.

Thank you very much.

Are you visiting Gaya?

No, me and my brother are returning
to Vernasi from Bombay.

Our father died,
we are taking his body

to be cremated
in the river Ganges.

Do you always cremate
your dead?

Well we have to, to help
their souls come back quickly.

You see, this body is just
a temporary vessel

and must eventually
be disposed of.

Exactly, who needs the body,

it's just a big pain
in the ass, isn't it?

You're a doctor, do you
believe in life after death?

Well I'm a doctor
and I'm a Hindu.

What do you think, Ben?
Is there life after death?

The way things are,
there's no life before death.

This train's moving
at a snail's pace.

Goodbye, you know where to find me
if you need me.

Yeah, yeah, thank you very much,
all the best, doctor.

Bye bye.

What's going on?

Conductor!

Isn't this train
going on to Gaya?

It doesn't look like
it's going anywhere.

Vernase Junction!

Conductor! Excuse me. - Yes?

Doesn't this train
go to Gaya?

No! This train goes back
to Bombay.

Which train goes to Gaya?

Platform No. 2.

Vernasi Junction!

What's going on? - We have to
change trains. Come on.

Porter! We need some help
with our suitcases.

Sorry, we're going to Gaya,
you said platform No. 2, right?

Tomorrow morning,
8 o'clock. - What?

Better hurry and find a hotel,
tourist season, you see.

Come on, let's go.
Follow this lady.

Be careful with the lady, right?

It's only 6 hours by car.
Let's take a taxi.

Come on.

So this is Gaya?

How is she?
Can I see her?

They released her a week ago.
Then where is she?

In a monastery called
Bod-Gaya, in the mountains,

20 km away from town.

They said there was nothing
else they could do for her

and that she was taking
up a bed.

We can assume
one of two things.

She either feels much better...
Or much worse.

They threw her out. - Calm down,
Dori, we'll soon find out.

Stop.

May I help you?

Yes, we are looking for our girl
who was brought here 3 days ago.

Oh yes, she's is here.
We've been waiting for you.

Come, I'll take her to you.

Sir, do you know how is
my daughter? Is she OK?

Come after me,
I'll show you.

Please remove your shoes here.

Where is she?
I don't see her.

OK, here is your daughter, Madame.

Einati! - Dori, Dori!

It's contagious,
cover your face.

And don't touch her.
Don't touch her.

Put the mask on.

Einati, we've come
to take you home.

This is Dr. Rubin, he came
especially for you.

Dori, you mustn't touch her.

What's going on? - Let me
examine her. Just one second.

Both of you, let me examine her,
please. Excuse me, Mrs Lazar.

Hi, Einat. I'm Dr. Rubin.

I'm going to
examine you now, OK?

Are you running a fever?

Let's take a look at your eyes.

Does that hurt?

Does this hurt?

OK, you're going to be fine.
I'll take care you,

and improve your condition,
I'll stabilize it,

and then we'll fly you home, OK?

May I roll up your shirt
a little, Einat?

Are you really a doctor?
Yes, I am.

Then you can roll up my shirt.
OK.

All this is from scratching?
It's all over my body.

This cream will help.
Rub it on every few hours.

Can I draw some blood?

She needs to be
taken home right away.

Abe, we brought a doctor
all the way from Tel Aviv,

why don't we hear
what he has to say?

She has a very high fever,
Both her liver and kidneys

were affected.

I gave her a blood test,
I need urine tests as well.

Go to the bathroom with her.

Tell me the truth Doctor,
how is she?

I really can't tell you
till I see the test results,

but you should ask the monks
to find her a room

of her own, where she'll be
comfortable, this is no good.

I'll take care of it.

We have to take you to the
bathroom, hold on to me.

Mom...

Yes, darling.
I want to go home.

Soon darling, soon.

Tea, please?

No. Thank you very much.

I'm Tomaio, I'm from Japan.

I'm Dr. Rubin. May I ask you
Tomaio, what are you doing here?

Come to do "Vispana",
2 weeks seminar of silence.

You came all the way for that?
Can't you be silent in Japan?

Yes, but this is the place
Buhda received enlightenment

until he reaches nirvana.

Here's her urine.

OK, they've given us
a bungalow in the garden.

Excuse me, can you take me
to Gaya hospital?

Make it fast please.

Is it far from here?

Don't move, OK?
It may take a few hours,

just stay here,
don't move, right?

Excuse me...

Please wait in line, sir.

Please just tell me where
I can find the lab, just tell me.

All these people are waiting
for something they want to know,

please wait in line.

Just show me where I can find the
lab, sorry, sorry, I'm a doctor.

Wait in line.

Sir, can you just tell me
where I can find the lab?

I'm lost.

We are all lost.

Hi, can you please just
direct me to the lab?

Yes, there is a way outside.

Yeah?

And it goes to a garden,
people are waiting there in the line.

You may also be there
one of the line.

Maybe that you'll find your
laboratory, and if not, pray Budha.

He may be there
in the line also.

Please wait for a minute,
can't you hear me?

I said wait for a minute.

Please, sorry, sorry,
excuse me, I'm a doctor.

I need to gat some blood
and urine tests.

Excuse me, hi,
I'm a doctor from abroad.

I need an urgent report on these
blood and urine samples.

My patient is dying.

All the people are
dying here, sir.

Please wait in line.

No, I can't wait.

You'll have to.

Look, I'll pay you
for the test,

I'll double the fee you charge
if you just do them immediately.

This is the Budhist hospital
and Budha is the God of the poor,

there are no charges here.

Yeah? My patient
is a guest in your country.

Just please help me, Madame,
OK, please?

OK, OK, please fill out
this form.

And write it down exactly and clearly
which tests you need,

then sign it here, OK?

OK, yeah.

And come back next week
to collect the results.

What?

Next week...

No, I can't wait till next week,

I'm telling you
my patient is dying.

Then go and tell God Budha...

What are you doing, sir?
Sir?

I'm going to Vernase, OK?

Vernase is...

Shut up! This is hospital,
this is not your home!

How will you get
to Varanasi today?

The driver said there are
trains to Varanasi.

He's waiting outside,

I think I'll be able to
make it back this evening.

I'm going with you.
Why? What for?

We don't want to loose
our doctor in India.

Really, Dori.

I have to go for
my own peace of mind.

I can manage on my own.

I'm of no help here,

and it's hard for me
to see Einat like this.

What'll I do in the meantime?

Rub this cream on
every couple of hours,

It'll relieve the itch.
Make sure she drinks a lot,

Tomaio will help you
in any case.

Shall we go?

Can you go to this place, please?

Thanks.

Sorry, sorry.

Go, go!

Sorry, excuse me please,
thank you.

Oh hello, please come inside.
My brother is expecting you.

Please, come in.
My brother is waiting for you.

Oh hello, Welcome, please come in,
Dr. Rubin, please sit down.

How is your daughter, Madame?
I wish we knew.

Yeah, well actually we need
your help, Dr. Sandin,

with some blood and
urine tests,

this is urgent.

How much time do you have?

Em... we would like to
go back to Gaya tonight. - Yes.

Good, I will need at least
about 6 hours

but your most welcome
to stay here

and wait for the report.

Thank you Doctor, I think
we shall walk for a while,

is that alright, Ben?
Yeah, sure.

Yeah, there are so many
places of interest.

You are in India's
holiest city.

Vernasi is the city
of the dead.

Doctor, we can thank you enough.

Oh, don't mention it.

OK, we'll leave you to
your patients,

it looks like you have
at least 100 out there.

Only 100? Then I have
an easy day ahead of me.

Oh my God...
Thank you, Doctor.

Look at them.

They were born dead, never
having the chance to live.

They're just waiting for Buddha
to redeem them from this life.

Yes, if he exists,
I'd say he's a cruel God,

Just as cruel as our God.

Where do you think
they're going?

To burn the bodies
in the Ganges.

Let's follow them.

What's going on?

I don't know, a religious rite
or something.

Why doesn't anyone help her?
I don't know.

Let's get out of here.

Dear brother,
Dr. Rubin is here.

Ah yes, Dr. Rubin,
I've been waiting for you.

Here are the reports.

How is my daughter?

Not well I'm afraid,
but not without hope.

It's OK, I'll study them later,
we have to catch our train.

We are very grateful.

So tell me, did you have
a good time in our holy city?

Oh yeah, I mean if you call it
a good time.

We... we saw a woman jumping
onto a funural pire

and burn herself to death.

Oh, a "Sati". You know that was
her husband's funural pire.

This still happens in India
although it's against the law.

Why did she do it?
Was she punished?

No, to save another soul.

Another soul,
I don't understand.

Well, she went to Sati because
she didn't want

to have another man in her life.

She wants to find the sould
of her husband in Heaven.

As you perhaps know that
Hindus believe in 2nd life.

This was a horrible sight.

I'll pray for your daughter,
Madame.

Thank you very much. - OK.

All the best, Doctor.

How is she doing? - Want
something to eat? - No, thanks.

Is Einat asleep?
I've asked you how she's doing.

I can't tell yet,
I'd better go in.

I have to give her
an interferon shot,

and you should prepare
to give her some blood.

As far as I know,
you need my blood.

Why, what about his?

He's not healthy himself
and has a rare blood type.

What's your blood type?
O plus.

You're sure?

OK, let's go in to see her.

How are you feeling?
You'll soon feel much better.

When are we going home?
Soon, really soon.

You must get stronger.

I'll give you some of your mother's
blood now, OK? Healthy blood.

Mom, are you really giving me
blood? - Yes darling, I am.

It's time to do it.
Come here, please.

Take off your blouse, Dori.
Let me help you.

Sit down on the bed.

Put your arm up here,
lean it against the pillow.

It must be high up, you know,
the law of connected vessels.

Hello, Air India? I need
to talk to Air India.

Yes, are you closed?

So when are you open?
Tomorrow morning?

OK, thank you, thank you.

Have you ever done this before?
A direct blood transfusion?

Yes, in the army.
In an emergency.

Is this an emergency?

We are in battlefield.
Who is the enemy?

The angel of death.

Mom, what do you think, will
we beat the angel of death?

Of course, trust Dr. Rubin.
I do.

Direct blood transfusions
aren't customary nowadays.

They may even be prohibited.
You're right sir,

but under the circumstances,
I have no choice.

How are you feeling, Einat?

Like a vampire.

You look fine, ladies.

Some tea, Mr. Lazar?
No thank you,

I have to go out.
Maybe later.

Are you going somewhere? - Yes,
to Gaya, to organize the tickets.

Do you really think we're
going home today? - Yes.

There's a flight tonight
from Bombay to Tel Aviv.

I'll come with you.

I want to do some shopping
before we leave India.

OK.

How is Einati this morning?
Still sleeping, so is the doctor.

Good. We'll be back in an hour.

Take care of them Tomaio.
I will. Bye.

Abe...

It's so beautiful here.

Yes, there's something
about India.

This is exactly how
I imagined heaven.

Look at all the flowers,
the statues, the smell.

After I leave this world,

my soul will look at your photos
and know exactly where to go.

You're not going anywhere.

That's why I'm here, right?
Don't move.

I'm in love with India.

I want to stay forever.

You're feeling much better,
aren't you?

Yes.

Great. - It's as if I was reborn.

It's your mother's
blood that's doing that.

Let's sit down a bit.

What do you think about her?

About who? - My mother.

She's great.

She's a wonderful woman.

I think she really likes you.

I think she planned all this
so that we'd meet.

I think she's planning
for us to get married.

It's good to see you laughing.

But she doesn't understand that
I'll never be like her and Dad.

Their love is boundless,
they're glued to each other

like Siamese twins.
I guess they share one heart.

I wish I could love that way.

I must be back in Tel Aviv
on Sunday,

for the opening of
the annual conference.

Doctor look, she's bleeding.

Do you have a tissue, Tomaio?
Yes.

Can you bring
my kit from my room?

You know, the blue one. - Yes.

Lay down for a bit.

Here. OK. That's it.

Lean your head.
That's it.

Hury up, Tomaio.
What is she doing there?

What's wrong with her?

I'm fine. - She has
a nose bleed, that's all.

Let's get her back to her room.
Help me, Dori.

Hold the tissue, but don't
touch the blood, careful.

Let's take her back to bed,
just don't touch her blood.

Why did you take her outside?
For some fresh air,

to prepare her for the trip.

I'd better go see
how she's doing.

Do you think Einat
can make the trip today?

Today? No. No way.

Tell your husband, Einat
is in no condition to travel.

We're leaving today.
No, if it's up to me...

We're going home today.
No, we're not,

but if your husband must go home
today, he can go by himself.

Maybe he's right and
the best thing to do,

is to take Einat to our
hospital right away?

Her condition is critical.
She has a high fever.

The trip could endanger her life.
Don't you understand?

It's dangerous!
Staying here is dangerous!

OK Dr, listen to me.

I take full responsibility.
She's my daughter.

We're taking her home today
and that's that!

You're making a big mistake.
A very big mistake.

Tomaio, don't forget
to write to me, alright?

I'll write to you, bye.

Miss Einat, go with
the blessings of Budha.

Einat. Einat.

Can you just take...

take the snake
and just go away, please.

Einat! - What's happening to her?

We must stop this insane journey
before it's too late...

I must give her another
blood transfusion, now!

Then take charge, you're
the doctor. You decide.

The tickets. We got an upgrade.

What happened?

Can I have a word with you?

What are you doing, Lazar?

Do you want to kill
Your own daughter?

Your daughter will die today if
I don't give her a transfusion.

Do you understand
what I'm saying?

Why did you drag me
all the way to India

if you don't listen
to a word I say?

What do you suggest we do,
Dr. Rubin?

Take her to a hospital
in Bombay?

A hospital, whatever,
let's find a hotel room

and I'll give her
the transfusion there.

Then she must rest
for at least 24 hours.

OK, I'll find a hotel.

Abe...

Listen to me.
Get on the flight.

I know you have to
attend your conference.

People are coming from
all over the world.

We'll come in a day or two.

Dad, get on the flight.
I'll be fine.

Here are your tickets.

Bye.

Take care of them, Ben.

They're both in your hands.

Call me.

Abe.

Hello?

Hi, it's me.
What are you doing? - Hi.

I fell asleep.

Join me downstairs,
I'm in the lobby.

How's Einat?

She's asleep. I think she's feeling
much better now.

That's great.

Are you coming down or must
I go see Bombay without you?

Can we have something
to drink?

Thanks.

Thank you.

How much?

My head is spinning.

But let's have
another glass of wine.

No, not for me.
I can't drink anymore.

Come on.

Here?

A glass of your
best red wine, please.

Take it easy.

I like it when
my head is spinning.

OK, I'll have
another one too.

Make it 2 please.
Of course, Madame.

Thank you.

Won't you ask me to dance?

Would you like me to?

God, you're acting
like a baby.

Isn't that how you
want me to act? - No.

I want you to act
just as your eyes express

when you're looking at me.

Oh no, you're reading
in my eyes now.

Can't I hide anything
from you? - No...

You can't.
Come on, let's dance.

My head is spinning...

Why don't you kiss me?
I know you want to.

Are you sure you want me
to kiss you? - Yes.

Everyone can see us.

So what?
Do we know them?

Kiss me.

India. What a strange place.

Remember the woman who jumped
in the fire at the Ganges?

I can't get it
out of my head.

Remember what the Indian doctor
told us about that ritual?

Sati, That's what
they call it.

I keep asking myself,

what exactly did he mean

when he said
she was saving her soul.

Maybe she didn't want
to stay alone in this hell

without the man she loved.

It was so sad.

I feel as if it was me
burning in that fire.

Dori...

I think I'm falling
in love with you.

Slow down, Ben.
We have all night.

We only have
what's left of it.

Mrs. Lazar,
I'll take it from here.

Wait, here's her medical report.
I don't need it.

When will I see you?

I don't know,
call me at the office.

Come on, Dori,
get in the ambulance.

Ben, take a few days off.
You need them. - Yes.

What about Einat? - Prof. Levine
will take care her.

Thank you very much. Bye.

This is Dr. Rubin speaking.

May I please speak
with Attorney Lazar?

Yes, she has my number.

Thank you.

This is
Dr. Ben Rubin speaking.

Yes, I already left a message
this morning, that's right.

Can you ask her to call me
on my mobile phone?

Yes, she has the number.

There you are. Our hero.
How was your vacation?

Good. How's Einat? - Fine.

Thanks to Prof. Levine's
wonderful treatment.

Go visit her.
She'll be happy to see you.

Dr. Rubin, how was India? We heard
how well you did. - Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Prof. Hissin,
may I have a word?

Hello, Dr. Rubin,
you're back?

I heard you worked wonders in India.

I'm glad I recommended you
for the trip.

Professor, can we meet today?

Not today, I'm busy.
When, then? - I said I was busy.

Mrs. Lazar, there's a young man
heading towards your office.

He doesn't have an appointment.
OK, I'll handle it.

Ben! What a surprise.

Sorry for sneaking in
your office without notice.

I left you a million messages.

I got them. I had many things
to attend to after the trip.

You're ignoring me. It's been
3 weeks since I last saw you.

Was there something important
you wanted to tell me? Sit down.

The truth.

And you think
I don't know the truth?

This can't go on.
That's the truth. - Is it?

Even if I think about you
every minute of every day?

Even if I realized
how much you mean to me?

Look, Ben, this is all
very flattering,

but where does it lead?

I don't care where it leads,

I just know that my life
is empty without you.

Look, I didn't want it
to happen in India.

But it happened.
It got our of control.

And since that night, I...

I want you and
I don't want you.

I'm so confused.

I want you, Dori,
I've missed you.

Ben, we can't.
It's wrong.

I don't understand how you managed
to sneak into my marriage.

But I'm just as
guilty as you are.

I could've stopped it
that night.

No, you couldn't have,
just as I couldn't.

Ben, you have to find
a woman your own age.

You have to get married,
build a home,

a family, have children.
That's the way of the world.

I hate this world.

Ben, nothing's changed
between Abe and I.

I do love you,
But I can't live without Abe.

You love him? - Of course.

How can you love him and me
at the same time?

I don't know, but I do.

Mrs. Lazar, Mr. Greenberg's here.
Just a moment.

I have a meeting,
you must leave.

I'm begging you.

OK Dori, what do you expect me
to do with my life?

Mr. Greenberg?

Thank you for coming,
Dr. Rubin.

And don't forget to find
the girl we talked about.

Come in, Mr. Greenberg.

Hi. - Hi.

It's you.

Ben Rubin, remember?

Of course, Dr. Ben Rubin.

You're back from India?
3 weeks ago, with Einat.

I know,
I saw her this morning.

When do you get off work?

In an hour.

I'd love a ride home.

Great. - Great. See you then.

Where are we going?

To Jaffa. There's an isolated
Beach, where we can be alone.

You want to be alone with me?

I didn't bring a swimsuit.
Neither did I.

What else did Einat tell you?
That you saved her life.

That's all she said?
You saved her from her parents.

What do you mean?
I don't get it.

You spent a week with them,
you should understand.

Didn't you the kind of
relationship they have?

They love each other very much,
is that what you mean?

It's not love,
It's an obsession.

An obsession.

An obsession. It's better
than what I saw growing up.

My parents barely
touched each other.

The last time
my mother hugged me,

I was about 5 years old.

Good morning.

Good morning.

Where are you going?
To make some coffee.

I'd love some.

Hello?

Where are you? I was
calling you all evening.

I'm out of town.
Is there something wrong?

I miss you, Ben.
Did I call at a bad time?

No, it's fine.

I couldn't sleep all night.
Where are you? - At home.

I took the day off,
I was hoping to see you.

There's an emergency,
they couldn't find anyone...

Do you want your coffee,
or prefer to leave right away?

Would you mind
if we went home?

I never felt like this.
Like what?

Happy.

I'm worried.
What about?

That I'll call you tomorrow
and you'll tell me it's over.

Anything can happen.

Dori, don't play games.

This is so hard. Suddenly
everything's so complicated.

I loved one man for 25 years.
I was never with anyone else.

Suddenly you show up,

and my whole world
turns upside down.

Falls apart.

What about you?

Me? - What about Michaela?
Michaela?

Einat told me.
I'm not jealous.

Michaela is a wonderful girl.
Einat's alive thanks to her.

Yeah, she really is a wonderful girl.

Then why aren't you with her?

You know why.

She's what you need. Pretty,
young, she can have kids,

she won't get wrinkled
like me, in a few years.

Why did you call me? To say
I can be with Michaela?

I called because I miss you.
I wanted you to touch me.

I was suffocating without you.

That's exactly how I feel
when I don't see you,

or when you won't listen to
what I'm going through.

Don't be mad, Ben.
I'm not mad,

it drives me crazy, Dori.

I hear your voice and
come running like an idiot.

Do you know where I was
when you called?

With Michaela.
Yes, with Michaela.

I hear your voice and
come running like a madman.

OK, now what? Tell me.

You're in charge, directing
my life. What happens next?

You go on with your life,
having nothing to do with me.

Is this how it's going to be?
You come, take me someplace,

we have sex, what's next?
Want to move in with me?

To your apartment?

I have to think about it.

Michaela? - What?

Do you believe in reincarnation?

Why do you ask?
Just curious.

You're the doctor.
Do you believe in reincarnation?

I used to think the soul
was a mere fabrication,

a yearning for the eternal,
a search for spirituality.

Since I became a "soul pilot"
I'm confused.

Come to me,
my soul pilot.

You're a confused doctor,
prepare for landing.

Do you like my apartment?

It's nice.

Intimate.

That's it?

It's quiet, pleasant.

What does that mean?
It's a nice apartment.

Yes, but what does it mean?
Will you move in or not?

Can I think about it?
OK, start now.

Come on,
I need some time.

Yes or no? - I won't say.
What does that mean?

Yes or no?
Leave me alone.

Are you OK?

It hurts.

It hurts.

It feels good.

"Soraski Medical Center,
Tel Aviv"

Ladies and Gentlemen.

We are hear tonight, to honor
and thank the Gershon Family

for their exceptionally
generous donation

which has enabled us
to open our new ward

for Lupus and blood diseases.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure

to introduce to you,
Mr. And Mrs. Charles Gershon.

Mr. Charles Gershon, please.

Ladies and Gentlemen...

How are you? I haven't
seen you in... - 4 weeks.

I'm also counting the days.
Are you OK?

Yes, I'm fine. - And Einat?

She's back home,

but she's moving to Jerusalem,
to study Psychology.

That's great,
I'm happy for her.

We're very grateful for
what you did for her.

Abe is also convinced
you saved her.

Abe is a wonderful man.

He's a lucky man, Dori.
I wish I was Abe.

What's going on in there?

What's going on?

Give him some room!
Let him breathe!

Mom, it's Dad!

Why the urgency to operate?

There are rhythm disruptions,
as a result of ischemia.

Are we sure?
Yes, we are sure.

His pulse is irregular,
he's about to go into VF.

Shouldn't we stabilize
him first? - Don't interfere.

We all think we should
operate immediately.

I'm removing a vein
from his right leg.

We're ready. - Go ahead.

Cover.

Scalpel.

6:30, cutting skin.

Is everything OK,
Dr. Rubin?

Yes, everything's fine.

Hissin, look.

Fibrillation.

Defibrillator.

Gel.

Unsynchronized 300,
stand clear.

Fibrillation.

Gel.

Unsynchronized 360,
stand clear.

Fibrillation.
Let me try. - Move!

You're losing him,
let me do it! - I said move!

Unsynchronized 360,
stand clear.

Fibrillation.

It's no use.
He's brain-dead.

360!

Fibrillation. - Come on,
Lazar! Come on! 360!

Fibrillation. - Come on, Lazar! 360!

It's no use, Lazar is gone.

What's going on?

What's come over you?
Nothing. - You're lying.

Do you want to tell me
what's come over you?

This whole Lazar thing,
the bypass was unnecessary.

You can't be sure.

I'm sure.

I've known everything about
heart surgery since childhood.

I was there, he shouldn't
have been operated.

But all Prof. Hissin ever
thinks about is his reputation,

the department's reputation,
he has to operate,

even if it's unnecessary.

Lazar died of internal bleeding.

We killed him.
It doesn't matter anymore...

It makes no difference
to Lazar. It doesn't matter.

What'll happen to Dori?

Who will take care of her,
he did everything for her,

she doesn't know how to do
the simplest things,

like using a washing machine,
things we do every day,

she knows nothing,
poor thing. - Ben...

I'm going out for
some fresh air.

Ben? - What?

Nothing.

Go for some fresh air.

Dori?

What are you doing here?

I was afraid you were
left alone. Is Einat here?

No, she went back to Jerusalem,

to study for her exams.

Are you OK?

I don't know.

You have a fever,
you should be in bed.

Let's go upstairs.

I haven't seen you since
the mourning period.

I'm here now and
you won't get rid of me.

What'll happen to you, Dori?

What'll happen to us?
I don't know.

All I want to do is sleep.

I just want to sleep.

Shall I give you a pill?
No, Ben, go home.

I'm groggy.

I want to sleep.

I'll make you a cup of tea.
You must drink.

I'll make you a cup of tea.

I thought you left.
No, I'm still here.

You should go home, Ben.
You should be with Michaela.

No, I should be with you.

Did you know that nothing
works in your kitchen?

The gas... - You shouldn't
leave her alone.

She understands, she went
to sleep a couple of hours ago.

Take this pill.

You know,
Abe liked you very much.

He always said
you'd go places.

I'm completely bleary now.

Go to sleep.

You'll feel better
in the morning.

Abe...

How will I manage
without you, Abe?

What will I do
with your Dori?

Talk to me, before I...

I was sure you know
what happened in India.

Mom?

Mom...

Einat, what are you
doing here this late?

I called but you didn't answer,
I thought something happened.

I thought you were sick.
I guess I was wrong.

Wait, I want to talk to you.
I have nothing to say to you.

Let me explain. - You're wearing
my father's robe! - Wait...

Hi.

I was sleeping...
I guess I fell asleep.

I called, but you didn't answer.
You must've also fallen asleep,

that's why you didn't answer.

I couldn't leave,
she's in an awful state.

What a mess. Nothing works,

a grown woman who can't manage...

I see you shaved.

Yes, you noticed?

Are you growing a moustache?

Dori fell asleep,
so I had some time...

Did you sleep with her?
What?

Did you sleep with her?
Did you fuck her?

What are you saying?

Did you fuck the old hag?
Did you stick your dick in her?

Stop it!
Stop it!

Stop it, Dori!

Dori? Michaela.

What's come over you, Ben?

Do you really think Lazar's
soul entered your body?

Or is that what you
want her to think?

I don't know.

I don't know what's
happening to me.

I have no idea
what happening to me.

What's happening?

It's you and all
your crazy ideas

about reincarnation...

Everything's so fucked up, Ben.

I was up all night
waiting for you.

Waiting to tell you something
I thought you'd like to hear.

What?

What did you want
to tell me?

I'm pregnant, Ben.

I'm pregnant with your child.

And I know it's yours
because unlike you,

I don't fuck others.

How long have you...
It doesn't matter.

Thank you. We won't
inconvenience you.

Michaela, please don't...
Don't touch me.

It's over between us.
I'm late for work.

Michaela, listen to me.

I'll stay here till
I find another apartment.

No, you stay here, I'll leave.

Ben, this was my fault as well.

I knew exactly what
was going on with you.

I was a fool.

I lied to myself.

I let this happen.

Be careful not to lose
your soul completely.

What do you want?

I'm so sorry, I thought
you were... - It's OK.

I'm sorry.

Michaela told me everything.

How is she?
It's nice of you to ask.

She's fine.

She moved in with me.
That's why I'm here.

And your mother?

Didn't you know? - What?
Didn't she tell you?

No, what?

She's in India.

In India?
She left this morning.

It's funny how India's
affected you.

I thought they took you
with them so that...

you'd meet me. But you fell
in love with my mother.

I know you think
I made a mistake.

I didn't plan on it,
it just happened.

You fell in love,
it can happen to anyone.

But letting someone else
fall in love with you,

without loving her and
getting her pregnant,

that's wrong.
You understand, Dr. Rubin?

Will you do me a favor?

Tell Michaela that if
there's anything she needs...

She doesn't need
anything from you.

How did you get in here?

Would you give me
back the keys?

Can I please have
my father's keys back?

Do me a favor and get
the hell out of here.

Hi.

Do you have by any chance a guest
under the name of Mrs. Lazar?

Lazar?

Dori Lazar.

I don't think so.

Are you sure?

Let me check for you.

Yes, check it out, please.

No sir, we don't have a guest
under that name.

Dori!

Dori!

Dori, don't do it! No!

Sir, there is an overseas call
for you.

She says it's urgent.
I think it's your mother.

Mom? Mom.

Excuse me. - Yes?

Michaela Weiss?
She's in room no. 1.

Hi. - Ben.

When did you get back?

Just now, I came straight
from the airport.

A girl.

A girl.
She was born last night.

She's so beautiful.

She looks like her father.

What did you name her?
Shiva. "'return" in Hebrew,

Shiva? Like the Indian God?

Not exactly.
I called her Shiva because

I was hoping her father would
return from India one day.

Forgive me, Michaela.

Sure. So you'll
come back to us.

I'm here.

I returned from India.

I'm here, Michaela.

"RETURN FROM INDIA"

A film by Menahem Golan

Subtitles by:
Elrom Studios

Once I thought that a soul
was just a human invention.

"A Menachem Golan Film"

It's a lust for immortality.

A search for the spirit.

"Adapted from A.B. Yeshua's
best seller"

Do you believe
in reincarnation?

"In a place where death
comes before life"

"In a world where beliefs
come before love."

Dr. Rubin, have you been
in India? - India? - Yes, India.

"Three people leave
for a journey"

We're speaking of my daughter,
Ainat, she's very ill

and we need a doctor who will
bring her home.

We're very pleased that
you're joining us on the trip.

My wife is traveling with us.

"A journey to save a life"

Ainaty. - When are we going
home? - Really soon.

"And when time is running out"

She's quite sick.

She's still
in critical condition.

Tell me, do you want to
kill your own daughter?

Her fever is over 104.
It's simply dangerous.

To stay here is dangerous.

"When life is almost over"

What do you say, are we going
to beat the angel of death?

"Something else begins"

"An impossible love"

It's possible that I'm falling
in love with you.

I didn't plan it,
it simply happened.

I miss you, Ben.
Did you sleep with her?

I'm pregnant, Ben. - You must
find a woman your own age.

No...

I need to be with you.

Acki Avni

I have no idea what's
happening to me.

Dori, don't do it, no!

Riki Gal

What happened between us in
India

is not something thatl wanted to
happen, but it did.

Asi Dayan - We're taking
her home today, and that's final!

Dana Parnas

Just be careful, Ben, that you don't
completely lose your soul.

Orly Perl - You fell in love with my
mother instead of with me.

What's happening with you,
Ben?

Funny what India did for you.
