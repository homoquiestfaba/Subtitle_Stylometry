(WIND BLOWING)

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(BIRD CAWING)

Jason?

You shouldn't be here.

Mom and Dad want you
to come home now.

I can't.
Why?

He won't let me.

No, no, no.


Bad dream?

Yeah.
Same one?

Yeah, Sof, same one.

(GIRLS GIGGLING)

GIRL 1: We are going to be so late.
GIRL 2: I know.

(PEOPLE CHATTING)

Hey!

Hello there!

What's up?

All right, everybody! Come on,
everybody,  listen up,  listen up.

All right.

We've got a lot of work ahead of us
over the next few days

to lock this place
down for the winter.

Hey, you guys.

RICK: As I was saying...

We've got a lot of work over
the next few days

before we
lock this place down,

so I've arranged for
an extra set of hands.

I want you all to meet James.

He's an old family friend.

Hey, everybody.
What's up, man?

James is hitching his way across
the country on his way to USC.

He's a got full scholarship,
no less.

Ooh.
Congratulations.

RICK: I roped him into
sticking around for a couple of days,
helping us out.

Let's get to it. Any volunteers who
want to pair up with James for the day?

Me.  I will.

Okay. Nice to see your
enthusiasm, Sofie.

Oh, one more thing.
We got some weather coming in,

so if you want to grab some extra blankets
from the shed tonight, go ahead.

Who needs blankets?
(EXCLAIMING)

RICK: All right. Let's go,
come on, everyone, let's go.

Freaks.

RICK: Ryan!

Can I see you for a second?

Here we go. I'll see you.

Did you put the wood chipper back
in the shed like I asked
you to last night?

Shit.
I knew it.

I'll take care of it right now.
No, it's too late.

The rain last night ruined
the motor.

I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

It's just like
the leaf blower.

The leaf blower
wasn't my fault.

And the canoe paddles?

Look, why are you always
on my ass?

Because you're a screw up.

What'd you say?

You heard me.

Look, I'm not impressed
with your macho bullshit

like your little girlfriend.

I'm going to say this once.

Your screw-ups are
costing me a lot of money

and I don't like it.

So what are you
going to do, Rick? Huh?

Are you going to fire me,
with only three days left?

Ah, the trees are turning
early this year.

Yeah. So much for
our Indian summer, huh?

Yeah. It's kind of lonely here
without all the kids.

Do not tell me you
miss them.

It's sad. The end of
summer and everything.

Don't you miss them?

Now that you bring it up...

Nah!

Come on, Mr. Tough Guy.
You can't fool me.

Deep down inside,
you're just a great big softy.

Actually, you know that kid
with the lazy eye?

He kind of got to me
a little bit.

See. I knew it.

(ALL CHATTING)

RYAN: I'd like to propose
a toast.

ANGELA: To what?

To the end of camp.

(ALL CHEERING)

ELVIS: Fuck, yeah.

May we not have to clean up
another camper's puke for
another ten months.

Or Elvis'.

(ALL LAUGHING)

That shit
was fucking nasty.

And now that the little bastards
have gone home to their
mommies and daddies,

we can turn our thoughts
to more adult pursuits.

Oh, hear, hear.

So what's tonight's mischief?

How about a game of
Bloody Murder?

Ooh!

RYAN: Great idea.
Who's up for it?

Elvis.

Come on.

Do I have to?

Don't be a chicken shit,
you're it.

Who's being
a chicken shit?

(MIMICS CLUCKING)

Fuck you, okay.

How about you, Mike?
You up for it?

Yup, yup. - Yup. - Yup.
Yup. - Yup.

Tracy?

Actually, I think I'm going to pass.

Trace.

It's fine.
You guys have fun.

Come on, Trace.

Actually, I'm really tired.
I'm just going to go
to bed early.

I thought we were gonna...

I'm serious.
You guys have fun, okay?

ANGELA: How lame.

ELVIS: Bye, Tracy!

Let me walk you back.

ELVIS: Bye, Mike!

(ALL LAUGHING)

Jesus. You guys are
so insensitive.

What?
What?

Don't play innocent. You knew
exactly what you were doing.

Mike of all people should know better.

I think I might have
missed something here.

Tracy's brother Jason disappeared
up here about five years ago.

Disappeared?

Well, there was a series of murders
that summer,

and Jason's body was never found.

The locals claim it was
Trevor Moorehouse.

They claimed.

Exactly.
Claimed it was Trevor Moorehouse.

I'm sorry, Tracy, that was...that
was insensitive of me.

It's okay.
I'm fine, really.

I just wasn't really thinking.

It's okay. I didn't even mean to
make a thing out of it.

Why don't you and I
just hang here

while the others run around
the woods like idiots?

Uh...
What do you say?

Mike...

What if I begged?

Mike.

What if I cried?

Even if you cried.

So, I'm sensing you're trying
to tell me no. Hmm?

Trust your senses.

I've tried really hard to get
close to you this summer.

Listen, Mike, don't make
a thing out of it.

I'm just saying, I mean,  I've tried so hard
to be sensitive to your family situation.

My family situation?
Is that really what you think of this?

I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

Well, What did you mean?

I can't get close to you.

You put up this front.

I'm tired of being treated like
I've got six heads.

Then you shouldn't have
told us about your brother.

What are you saying?

I'm just saying
it's a little confusing.

You know, you either want the attention
or you don't.

I don't think I want to talk
about this anymore.

Fine.

(ELVIS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

(ALL LAUGHING)

RYAN: Hey, you need a beer?

ANGELA: Hey.

Amen, brother.

Got back kind of quick.

Looks like
somebody's not getting any tonight.

(ALL SNIGGERING)

What else is new, man?

James here has been asking about
Trevor Moorehouse.

Fuck Trevor Moorehouse, man.
That guy's putting a serious
dent in my sex life.

Who was he?

Somebody else tell that story.

Trevor was the son of the meanest
camp director that Placid Pines
has ever seen.

See, he had this habit of ratting
on the counselors to his old man.

Well, one year,
several of the counselors

got this half-assed plan
to get back at them.

But things got out of control,
and before they knew it,

Trevor was at the bottom
of a ravine half-dead

with his face
eaten by hungry birds.

What happened to him?

Well, naturally...

Naturally, he went to the hospital.

Medical at first, then mental.

His face was so badly disfigured
that he took to wearing a mask all the time.

Yeah, how did you know?

Every summer camp has
a Trevor Moorehouse.

JAMES: Here, let me see.

At some point he was either released,

or he broke out of the mental hospital.

Then it's said he returned
to Camp Placid Pines

to forever seek out
his revenge on the place

and the people
that did this to him.

How'd I do?
Smart ass.

Set up the new guy, huh?
Nice try, boys.

Trevor Moorehouse is just some
fictitious local psychopath

to get campers into bed at night.

Fictitious local psychopath, huh?

Did you really think I'd be
stupid enough to fall for that?

You think I'm making it up?

I hope not.

I would think you'd be able to
come up with something

a little better than the old
'psychopath-in-the-woods story.'

Well, then, tough guy,

since you've got nothing to fear,
you won't mind being it.

(ALL CHUCKLING)

Okay, sports fans.

It's time for a little game of...

Bloody Murder.

Angela, do the honors.

Of course.

Wait a minute.
I didn't say anything...

What's the matter, Jimbo?

Huh? You having a little
change of heart?

Scared?

You afraid Trevor might
break up the game?

No. I just
don't feel like...

Good! Then let the pretty lady
blindfold you.

Remember there's
nothing to fear...

But fear itself.

Let the games begin.

(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

Remember, you've got to count to 20 before
you can remove the blindfold.

Okay.

Everybody ready?
Yeah!

Go!

One 1000. Two 1000. Three 1000.
Four 1000. Five 1000.

Eighteen 1000. Nineteen 1000.
Twenty 1000.

Oh, man.

Me and my big mouth.



You're not in Compton anymore.


(EXCLAIMING IN FEAR)

Trevor!
Trevor Moorehouse!

(JAMES SCREAMING)

You were saying something about
fictitious local psychopaths?

We got him.
Amen, brother.

What's going on?

We're just having a little fun
at James' expense.

Tell him about the psychopath,
then they come out
dressed as him.

That's hot, baby.

That was beautiful
with the blood.

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Trevor Moorehouse!
Oh, my God!

Rick was right about you.

Yeah, well, what's that?

You are an asshole.
What did you say?

ELVIS: Oh, shit.

I said you're an asshole.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Come on, man.
Fuck.

Break it up, guys!

Come on, you're dead,
you little fucker!

MIKE: That's enough. Get up.

Don't fuck with me!

Fuck you, bitch!

Get your little friend out of here
before he gets hurt.

Easy!

RYAN: Shit!

You okay?

Yeah.

He's not the first asshole
I've had to deal with.

He certainly
won't be the last.

I'm gonna head back up,
but I'll see you in the morning.

Yeah, if I decide to stay.

Don't let that loser
get to you.

We'll see.

Good night.
Good night.


(FOOTSTEPS RUSTLING)



All right, guys.

Give it a rest.

Fuck, the joke's over.


Very funny, dickhead.

Oh, for Christ's sakes,
I am too fucking tired for this shit.

Aah!

Help me!

Ah! Help me!

Help me!




(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

(KNOCKING ON DOOR CONTINUES)

Special delivery for the world's most
forgetting boyfriend.

I'm sorry, Mike.

I was up all night thinking about it,

and I have been so wrapped up
in myself all summer.

I mean, I couldn't have been
much fun to be around.

I'm sorry, too.

It's just that things were never the same
at home after Jason disappeared.

My Mom and Dad were destroyed,

and all the other families, they knew
what happened to their loved ones.

They were able to have funerals,
and counselling,

and all that other shit that's supposed
to give you closure.

I feel like I've been carrying around
this huge weight,

and I'm just ready to move
on with my life.

You know I'm here for you.

So...

I was thinking that, uh,

maybe we should just enjoy ourselves
for the next few days.

I'd like that.

(PAGER BEEPING)

It's Rick.

He wants us to, ah, meet him
in the mess hall.

(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)

Oh, God, turn that annoying thing off!

Oh, shit.

Who is it?
Oh, wait, let me guess--Rick.

Yeah, get up. He wants to
meet us in the mess in five.

Oh, fuck!

You look like you need
something for a hangover.

Hey, have you guys
seen James this morning?

No. Man, he didn't even come
back to the cabin last night.

(EXCLAIMING FEARFULLY
IN SPANISH)

That's Trevor Moorehouse.

Juanita, you blame Trevor Moorehouse
if the milk spoils.

I see him come out at night.

Okay, Juanita.

Hey.

What happened last night?

What do you mean?

James left a note saying he thought
it would be best if he moved on.

Well, we had a little too much
to drink last night,

and things kind of got out of control.

A little bit.

You better have a
goddamn good story.

I will talk to you later.

Senor Rick?
Yeah, Juanita?

Senor Rick, I don't want to
stay with Trevor Moorehouse.

Juanita, I can assure you there is
no such thing as Trevor Moorehouse.

If you could just stay on for the next
couple of days until we get
this place packed up.

I make everything and freeze it
for you today, but...

(EXCLAIMING FEARFULLY
IN SPANISH)

Trevor Moorehouse.

So what do you think happened to
James last night?

James?

Best case scenario,
he took off like Rick said.

Worst case scenario,

Trevor turned his ass
into lunchmeat.

Don't tell me you actually believe
that stuff about Trevor Moorehouse.

Nah, I'm just messing with you.

I mean, if I did,

you think a guy like me would
be hanging around for much longer?

What do you mean,
a guy like you?

A black man.

Everybody knows black guys
get it first in horror movies.

It's like horror films 101.

Black guys?

What about women?

Girls always buy it
early in those movies,

usually after they show their boobs.

Yeah, but even so,
I still have it worse.

How do you figure?

(BOTH GRUNT)

You have some degree
of choice

of whether to show your boobs
or not, and to whom.

Me?

I'm black
no matter what I do.

How many tubes
are there supposed to be?

Rick said eight.

Shit, I've only got seven.

Here, use these.

I'm going to go look for it
on the other side of
the lake, okay?

Mike?

Hurry back, okay?

Yeah.

You know,

seeing you around mattresses all day  has
got me thinking of certain things.

Really?

You just smell like
sweat and piss stains.

Well, maybe we should
just hit the showers.

Maybe.

(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)

What's that?
What?

I thought
I heard something.

(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)

Oh, shit, it's my pager.

Ignore it.

(BOTH MOAN)

(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)

Oh, I can't.

Yes, you can.

No.

Rick wants to see me up at the point 'ASAP.'

Oh, fuck.

Tell me about it.

You're not going to go?

If I don't,
he'll be all over me.

And what am I
supposed to do here?

You'll think of something.

You're sick.

Rick!

This is a waste of time.



(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)

Oh, my God!

Fine, don't answer.

Elvis, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

No, it's okay.
What's the matter?

I think I just saw Trevor Moorehouse.

What?

Tracy, you're trippin'.

Mike, thank God.

What's up, Trace?

I saw him.
Who?

Trevor Moorehouse.

All right, come on, let's
talk outside.

Just give it to me
again, okay?

Just this time slowly.

I was at the lake,

looking for
the missing tube,

and I saw him
through the binoculars.

The mask, the workman's
clothes, the whole bit.

You're sure?

You don't believe me,
do you?

Trace, isn't it possible you just let
your imagination get the best of you?

I know what I saw, Michael.

Okay, I have an idea.

So you say you saw the person
walking somewhere
in this area?

Yeah, I think so.

SHERIFF: Could've been
late summer tourists.

Sometimes they don't clear out
for a couple of weeks
after Labor Day.

Do many tourists walk around
the woods wearing masks, Sheriff?

(SHERIFF CHUCKLES)

All right, Tracy,
I'll tell you what.

Here's my card.

You see anything out of the ordinary,
you give me a call, day or night.

In the meantime, I'll have one of my deputies
come up here a couple of times a day,

check the camp out, okay?

Thanks, Sheriff.

Hey, Tracy, why don't you finish up
with Mike and call it a day?

Uh, Sheriff,

there's something I think
you ought to know.

Tracy's brother, Jason,

he disappeared up here
about five years ago.

There's a rumor that
Trevor Moorehouse got to him.

Well, that would explain
the mask she thought she saw.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

That jerk.

Huh?
I said, that jerk.

Which jerk would that be?
Guess.

Ryan.
No, Rick!

Me and Ryan were in
the shower cabin,
about to do it,

and Rick pages him,
telling him to go to the point.

I haven't see him since.

Rick's just jealous of Ryan.

He's got, like,
a thing for you.

Ugh, could you imagine?


And that, my fair lady, is it.

Not right now.

Hey, I thought we agreed
to enjoy ourselves,

and leave all
the other stuff behind?

I know.

I'm sorry, it's just...

that thing before kind of threw me.

Come on, Trace, it's our last
couple of days up here.

Mike, it...
it really shook me up.

You said yourself you have
to just kind of let it go.

Let's just try to get past it, okay?

(TRACY GROANS)

Mike...

I don't think I can do this.

You know what,
just forget about it, okay?

Please don't be mad at me.

I'm so tired of this shit, Tracy.

Just get in the truck, okay?

Just get in the truck, I'm taking you back.

Hey, guys.

I got a little bad news.

I got a page from Ryan
about an hour ago.

He quit and he headed home.

Just like that?
Yeah, just like that.

I'm not surprised, I didn't think
he'd make it this far anyway.

You're joking, right?

He didn't tell you?

No.

I would've thought for sure
he'd have told you.

Bastard.

I need a cigarette.

Let her be alone.

Anyway, with all this attrition,

there's an extra $50 bucks
in it for each of you

if we close camp on schedule.

(DOOR SHUTS)

I don't buy it.

Tracy, you're reading into things.

Reading into things?

Three people have left this camp
in the past 24 hours,

and not one of them has even bothered
to say good-bye.

We've spent the entire summer
with two of them,

and they just up and leave?

First of all, they didn't just up and leave.

James left a note,

Ryan just paged Rick,

and Juanita gave her notice.

Besides, she's been jumpy
all summer anyway.

But they would have at least
said good-bye.

I mean, don't you guys see anything
wrong with that?   Sofie?

It is a little weird.

I mean, come on,
Elvis, think about it.

It doesn't seem even the tiniest
bit strange to you?

Well, what do you think
happened, then?

I don't know.

But I want to find out.

What should we do?

Shit, I'm going to tell you
what I'm going to do.

I'm not taking any chances.

Anybody approaches my crib,

I'm gonna get straight totally hitting
video on his ass.

What else?

We should try and find
Mike and Angela,

and have them meet
back at our cabin.

Elvis, why don't you go down
to the lake,

and then to the obstacle course
to look for them,

and Sofie and I'll
check their cabins,

and if they're not there,
we'll leave a note.

You got it.

Oh, and, Elvis,

don't make a big deal out of it.

And definitely
don't say anything to Rick.

Hey.
Hey.

What are you doing?

I had to take a walk.

You shouldn't be out here alone.
Get in here.


What's the matter?

Did Ryan say anything to you?

About what?

Leaving.

He left this afternoon.

He went home?

That's what Rick said.

Really?

I knew it was just
a summer fling.

And I knew all about
his girlfriend back home.

I knew about all that.

Like, he left, he didn't
even say good-bye.

Nothing.

Can't believe I let myself fall for him.
I was so stupid.

Hey, hey, hey.

(ANGELA SOBBING)

You're not stupid.

I'm such an idiot.

MIKE: Hey.

You're not an idiot.

I can't believe
he did this to you.

Angela!

Mike!

Do you have anything?

No. I took my school physical.

I mean protection, idiot.

Up at the cabin.

No skinny dipping allowed.

You want me to go all the way
back to the cabin?

Nice try, it's right around the bend.

Go.

Wait here, I'll be right back, okay?

Mike?

Mike, are you in there?

(MIKE AND ANGELA MOANING)

Oh Shit.

Mike, you dog!

Damn, she's fine.


Oh, man.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Yeah?
Hey, it's me, Elvis.

Hey.
Hey.

So did you see 'em?

Uh, no. You?

No, but we left notes.

Man, this is some
deep-ass shit.

Did Rick see you?

I don't think so.
Good.

Look, I didn't mean for
this to happen.

It's okay.

I won't say anything
to anyone.

We've got to
get out of here.

Yeah.

Shit.
What?

Where the hell are
the rest of my clothes?

I don't know.
Where'd you drop them?

Kind of hoping you could
help me with that one.

Check over there.

Shit, I cannot see a thing.

Keep looking.

I'm going to go in the truck,
I think I have a flashlight.

I fail to see
the humor here, okay?

(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)

Ryan?

Ryan, it's not funny.

(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)

(ANGELA SCREAMING)

That's Angela.

(ANGELA SCREAMING)

(ELVIS GROANS)

(TRACY GROANS)
ELVIS:  You okay?

Don't touch me!

Stop it. Stop it. Angela.

Listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

<i>ELVIS: Angela!</i>

<i>ELVIS: Angela!</i>

Oh, shit, Angela, they're coming.

They cannot find me
with you like this, okay?

I got to go, okay?
Okay--

The medical examiner thinks
the kid was probably
buried there,

but some hungry animals dug him up
and made a late night snack out of him.

Lovely. Thanks, Tim.

Needless to say,
we're dealing with a homicide.

Unfortunately, you're all
under suspicion.

What?

I'm going to have to ask you all to
stay put until we can make some sense of this.

Is anyone unaccounted for?

Mike and Rick.

Rick's SUV isn't here.

Have somebody go into town,

find him, send him back
as soon as possible.

Don't tell him
what it's about.

Got it.

When's the last time
you saw Mike?

The last time I saw Mike was
late this afternoon.

Check it out. When he turns up,
I want to talk to him first.

I'm gonna leave a couple of
my deputies up here.

They're gonna keep an eye on you,
ask you some questions.

I need you to cooperate.

Am I at least allowed
to take a shower?

I mean,
I'm all covered in mud.

Yeah, me too.

Go with them.

I'm going to run
the body up to the morgue, okay?

Hey.
Got everything?

Yeah.

The boys' shower is right up  the path.
Okay.

Fucking lights!

(ELVIS SCREAMS)

(ELVIS GASPING)

Oh, my God,
what happened?

I think somebody sucker-punched me.

Tim?

Tim, do you copy?

TRACY: Oh, no.
Tim, you all right?

Someone hit me from behind.

Wait here.

Hey, hey.

Oh, my God.

Oh, God!

Hey, Boss?
Yeah?

I'm gonna go search the cabins.
You want to take a look?

I'll be up in a minute, Ben.
Thanks.

This is a real mess, isn't it?

I've never seen anything like this.

Any luck finding the weapon?

No, I got Carver and the guys
out there but they haven't
found anything yet.

Well, keep on it.
We'll see what happens.

Okay.

What happened, Sheriff?

Where you been all night?

I was in town, picking up supplies.

Anybody see you there?

Yeah, several people, I think.

Jimmy at the market for sure.

What happened?

Well, it seems we have a couple
of bodies on our hands.

Not again.

POLICEMAN: Sheriff, you should hear this.

Thanks. Gopher One.

Really? Great, thanks.

Seems we have a psychopath
on our hands.

Just found another body.

Male, late teens, USC T-shirt.

It's James.

You know him?

He was an old friend.

He worked here for a day
and then he moved on.

At least-- at least--
I thought he did.

All right, stick around.

Any word on the Mike character?

Not yet.

Okay,  Tim,  you stay here;
keep an eye on the girls.

I'm going to take all the guys,
we're going to check all the roads,

we're going to catch this guy
by morning, okay?

Okay.

TRACY: Sheriff?

Yeah?

You can't honestly think that Mike had
anything to do with this, can you?

Well, it's beginning to look that way.

It's impossible.

Sheriff, you're going to want to see this.

Where did you find this?

That kid, Mike's cabin.

Really?

So do you guys really think that Mike
had anything to do with this?

I don't know what I think anymore.

Angela, I'm really sorry about Ryan.

Me too.

Thanks, guys.

When was the last time you saw him?

We were in the shower cabin,

and Rick paged him and told him to meet him
up at the obstacle course.

Rick paged him?

Yeah, that's what he said.

Ssh, he's coming.

Hey.

I'm really sorry about all this.

If there's anything I can do,
just let me know.

I just feel awful.

<i>Hey.
Got everything?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

Oh, my God!

Hey.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Stay away from me!

What?

Everybody's looking for you.

I know.

Ryan,
Elvis and James are dead.

Tracy, I had nothing
to do with that.

Don't come any closer.

Tracy, you are the only
one who's going to believe me!

Stop or I'll scream!

Help! Somebody, help me!

Help! Somebody, help me!

TRACY: Help!

Help me! Help!

Tracy!
Help me! Help!

Tracy!
Help me! Somebody, help me!

Help! Help!

Help! Somebody help me!

Help!

He's here. Mike's here.

Where'd he go?
Up that way.

Stay here.

<i>Carver?
Gopher Carver. Over.</i>

That kid might be headed up your way.
I'll come up from behind. Over.

Freeze! Don't move.

He's going to need
a real good attorney.

All right, Sheriff.
Thanks for your help.

God!

I thought we were going to make it
through this summer without any trouble.

That's what they say every summer.

I'll keep you posted, all right?

Thanks, Sheriff.

What's wrong?

I don't know.

It's too much to
think about right now.

You think you really know the people
who are closest to you.

Then you find you don't know
anything about them at all.

It's scary.

(CHAINSAW MOTOR WHIRRING)


Where's Rick?

I haven't seen him yet this morning.

I've just been replaying this whole summer
over and over again in my head.

And it just doesn't make sense.

We're missing something.

Trace, you saw the video tape
with your own eyes.

I can't believe that I could have
misjudged Mike that way.

I mean, did you ever think in your wildest dreams
that he was capable of that?

No. But that's the way it always is.

But why would he do it?

I didn't know psychopaths
needed motives.

I still don't buy it.

Well, then, who else would
have done it?

Rick, for one.

I mean, he was also unaccounted for
during all of the murders.

Rick had an alibi.
At least he says he does.

So did Mike.

What?

He was with me.

What do you mean?

I mean that we were together.

That pig.

Don't blame Mike, okay.

It was my idea.

I'm sorry, Trace.

Under different circumstances,

I would probably
scratch your eyes out right now.

But we have bigger things to deal with.

So I'm going to take a rain check
on the eye scratching out thing.

All right.

Why didn't you tell us this last night?

I don't know, it just all happened so fast.

I was about to,

and then they found that mask
in his cabin.

And I didn't know what to do
or think about it.

We found Ryan's body, right?

And then
all you guys came running.

Mike probably didn't want to get caught in
a compromising position

so he hid for a while.

No. Mike was still unaccounted
for during Elvis' murder.

Come on. Do you guys really
think that Mike's a killer?

I mean,
the guys is a lot of things

but a killer?

Come on.

What about the tape?

It could have been doctered.

Exactly.

Howdy, campers.

Listen, girls, Look, I think we've
been through just about enough,

so I'm going to bring in some
locals and finish up here.

Why don't you
give your folks a call?

If you need it, I'll arrange transportation
to the town for you.

Get you back home.

In the mean time,
I'm going to get showered and

head into town for a bit.

If you could, I could use a little help
for dinner tonight.

Sure.
Yeah.

Yeah.

(DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS)

Wait a minute.

You said that Rick paged Ryan and told him
to meet him at the obstacle course

right before he disappeared, right?

Yeah.

Well, and Rick said that Ryan paged him
to tell him that he was leaving.

So?

So our pagers hold up to 50 incoming
and outgoing messages in the memory, right?

Yeah.

Right, so all we have to do  is
compare Rick's pager to Ryan's and Mike's

and we should be able
to narrow down the killer.

All we have to do
is find Ryan's pager,

and get a hold of Rick's pager
without him knowing.

How the hell do we do that?

So let me get this straight.

You never saw Elvis last night,

and that isn't you on the tape.

Yeah, that's me on the tape,

but I haven't seen that
Trevor Moorehouse outfit

since last when we played that joke
on James a couple of nights ago.

Somebody must have doctored up
that tape.

And where were you at
approximately 10pm last night?

I told you, man,
I was with Angela.

I was messing around with Angela,

and I didn't say anything at first 'cause
Tracy's my girlfriend.

But that is the truth.

And Angela can vouch
for your whereabouts?

You talk to Angela,
and I'm in the clear, okay?

(SHOWER RUNNING)

(VELCRO RUSTLING)

(SHOWER TURNING OFF)

There are no pages from Ryan
in Rick's pager memory.

And then the pages from yesterday
were erased.

So we can only assume
that he's lying.

Shit.

(CAR PULLING AWAY)

He's gone.

Angela, I need you to go
look for Ryan's pager.


I'm going to have another look
at that video tape.
Mmm-hmm.

Why don't you stay here and start
cooking dinner in case Rick gets back?

So he doesn't get suspicious.

<i>Hey.
Got everything?</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>

(VIDEO REWINDING)

<i>...Sofie and I'll check their cabins,</i>

<i>and if they're not there,
we'll leave a note.</i>

(JINGLE ON PAGER PLAYING)


Please.


(EXCLAIMS IN SURPRISE)
Where's Angela?

She's not back yet.
We have to get out of here now.

Why?
I don't have time to explain.

Where does Rick keep the keys
to his truck?

In his office.

Where, Sofie?
I don't know.

Go find Angela and
meet me up front, okay?

Just go!

(DOOR SHUTS)

I can explain that.

I'm all ears.

I found that the morning
that James left.

Why didn't you tell the Sheriff?

I didn't want to scare
everyone unnecessarily.

I have my entire life's savings
invested in this camp,

any bad press, I lose everything.

Besides, I thought it was
another one of Ryan's
practical jokes.

Look, Tracy,

I admit I should have
done something sooner,

but I'm not a killer.

Don't you come any closer,
I'm warning you.

Tracy, it's all true.

What about Ryan?

You were the last one
to page him.

I never paged Ryan that day.

You killed those boys.

And then you tried to frame Mike.

Tracy, you don't know
what you're talking about.

You have to believe me.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

RICK: Drop it!

(RICK GROANS)

Angela?


Tracy? I know you're in here.

If we can just talk,
I can explain the whole thing.

Tracy?

I'll explain everything if
you'll just come out.

(TRACY GRUNTS)

(BANGING ON DOOR)


Oh, come on, answer the phone,
damn it, answer the phone!


<i>Miller.</i>

It's Tracy.
The tape was rigged.

It's not Mike, it's Rick
and I can prove it.

<i>Where's Rick now?
He's locked in the shed.</i>

<i>All right, I'm on my way.</i>

Tracy?

I know you're in here.

If we can just talk,

I can explain the whole thing.

Tracy?

Just come out, Tracy.

Tracy!

Don't!

Come on, Tracy.

Let me explain.

RICK: Calm down, Tracy.

RICK: I didn't...
(GUN FIRES)

Still no sign of the other girl.

All right, pull your guys,
call it a night,

we'll start the search again
in the morning.

Roger that.

Don't worry, we'll find her.

You know, it never ceases
to amaze me,

how much trouble can happen
up at one camp.

I told them.

I told them they shouldn't
open this place

after all the trouble they had
here five years ago.

Did they listen?

Well, I guess they'll listen now.

And you know,
I have you to thank for it.

Well, I thought I was in the clear

when I framed your boyfriend
for all those crimes.

You know, digital video,
conclusive evidence.

Then you put a glitch in my plan.

Why are we stopping?

Oh, I think you know.

No, no, no, it won't open.

You're not dealing with some
Johnny-come-lately camp psychopath.

Now we're having fun.

Isn't that right, Mike?

Oh, my God, no! No!

Oh, my God, no!

Oh, no, no!

(TRACY SOBBING)

You're going to die out here,
just like your brother did!

But why?


Why, Tracy?

'Cause somebody's got to pay
for what they did to my boy!

Trevor Moorehouse's father?

That's right.

Meanest camp director
Placid Pines ever had!

They just didn't know
how mean.

You lay low for a couple
of years, you go out of state,

get some
law enforcement experience,

change your name, of course.

Then you come back,
the local sheriff dies mysteriously,

they got to
replace him quickly.

Enter Clayton Moorehouse!

Back to the place that
ruined his life.

But this time to get even!

(SOFIE GRUNTS)

Run, Sofie, run!

(BANGING ON DOOR)

Shit! Damn it.

Shit!

If you think for one second,

I'm not going to find you,
you're sadly mistaken.

Remember, I helped
build this place.

When we first came out here,
there were nothing but trees.

Trees everywhere, pine trees.

And then you counselors came along
and you ruined everything.

God damn it!

(BOTH SCREAM)

Ssh.

Thank God you're okay.

Where is he?

I don't know.

The phones are dead.

Shit.
What are we going to do?


Tracy!

You're really just making this
harder on yourself.

You should have never
come up here.

You of all people
should have known that.

Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

I know you're in here!

Now come on out where
I can get a good look at you!

Come on out where
I can see you!

Well, well, well,
look what I found.

Now.

(SOFIE SCREAMS)

(SHERIFF SCREAMING)

(BOTH PANTING)

Now what?

The main road, the hard way.
Okay.

That's far enough, girls.

You ever get deja vu? Huh?

'Cause I'm having one
right at this very moment.

This is the exact spot where I killed
your brother five summers ago.

You killed Jason?

You always remember your first.

(CHAINSAW MOTOR WHIRRING)

Trevor!

Trevor, son!

It's me, Daddy!

No, Trevor!

SHERIFF: No, Trevor!
(TRACY SCREAMS)

(TRACY SOBBING)

No!

(MOTOR REVVING)

Please don't.

(MOTOR REVVING)


(MOTOR REVVING)

No, no.

(MOTOR STOPS)

Are you okay?

I think so.

(CARS APPROACHING)
