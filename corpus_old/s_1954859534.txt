              Yup.

       Are you mad at me?

              No.

      You ready for this?

       Yeah. Let's do it.

    I just want to go home.

          That was it?

      [man] <i> Good morning,</i>
        <i> Lake Arrowhead.</i>

    <i> Today's forecast calls</i>
  <i> for highs in the upper 80s</i>

   <i> and lows in the mid-70s.</i>

    <i> A great day to get out</i>

   <i> and enjoy some sunshine.</i>

         - I love you.
       - I love you more.

        I love our love.

          Oh, my God!
I hate this field trip already.

         Why aren't you
     a hot chick, too, bro?

             Ouch!

         Shut up, Chad.

    And can you please stop
   making out with my sister

        in front of me?

I'm sorry that this bothers you

      and that she happens
       to be your sister.

            [woman]
      Eww, eww, eww, eww.

          It's 7 a.m.
     What's wrong with you?

       This entire school
     is riddled with STDs.

   OK. Listen up, everybody.

            Today is
    an important day for me.

  We are going on a field trip
             to see

       one of my favorite
 artists' work--Pablo Picasso.

       He is just simply
        one of the best,

   second only in my opinion
        to Anne Geddes.

      Love her photographs
        of little babies

      in pumpkin patches.

     So I don't want anyone
   breaking any of my rules,

    and if one person breaks
            a rule,

  then every single one of you

           will fail.

   Let's have an awesome day.

   We're missing two people.
        Where are they?

     OK. You got everything
           you need?

   Yes, sir. Packed a lunch,
        got my notebook,

        bottle of water,
      two trail mix bars,

  phone charged, ready to go.

     Heh heh. You are your
       father's daughter.

  OK. Serious. Please, please,
 please be careful down there.

  I know what happens at these
    spring break trips, OK?

    Dad, I already told you.
This isn't a spring break trip.

       It's a field trip
      for Miss Goldstein's

       art history class.

You get extra credit if you go.

      You are a straight-A
         student, Abby.

       OK. How about you,
       me, your brothers,

  we do a little deer hunting
       this weekend, huh?

    We play a little poker?

 Sounds fun, but I don't know.

        I actually like
     going to see museums.

Plus, I don't need extra credit,
      but Kate needs it to

       graduate in time.

     You're a good friend.

          OK. Please,
       please behave, OK?

       And let's face it.

       There's something
    about you and Kate, OK?

  Kate can get you in trouble.

     [woman] Why would you
        trust technology

     over someone who knows
      what they're doing?

   a billion-dollar satellite

        that updates it
      every single second.

  - It knows what it's doing.
      - I don't think so.

        I'm sorry, Kate.

     [dad] Yeah, I'm sorry
    we've ruined your life.

           [mom] Ohh!

     Oh, look. We're here.

          Oh. Finally.

   Thanks for the ride, guys.

   - Have a great field trip.
            - Ah-ah.

        Y-you know what?

          Um, there is
    actually something that

    your father and I wanted
     to talk to you about.

   Can it wait until tonight?

          [dad] Sure.

  Uh, no. We should do it now.


      [mom] Uh, no, it's--

   [dad] Oh, the other--yeah.

    All right. This is--this
    will only take a second.

     [Abby] Morning, guys!

      Who's excited to see
       some art museums?

I'm excited to go back to sleep

    once that bus gets here.

     Museums are just man's
      pathetic attempt to

    document our meaningless
   existence on this planet.

         Dude, come on!

    Can you please not start
      with this nonsense?

       It's 7 a.m. Jesus!

         Our love isn't
       meaningless, baby.

         No, it's not.

     [Goldstein] Actually,
       it is meaningless.

   Your love is meaningless.

     Sweetheart, we know we
    said we would pay for it

      if you got into NYU,
       even if you didn't

   get the track scholarship
        you didn't get,

but turns out we didn't mean it.

          Is that bad?

     We don't have the--we
        can't afford it.

      We don't have the--

       we're not liquid.

   W-wait. What do you mean?

      Your father blew all
  of our money on another one

 of his stupid business ideas.

     Uh, a dating web site
   for pets is a great idea.

      Liz, you even said,
     "That's a great idea."

    No. Pets don't know how
       to use a keyboard.

  That is the dumbest idea I--

     Do you realize this is
     exactly what happened

    last time with the car?

       Bees were supposed
         to go extinct.

 That was gonna be a cash cow.

       Read the Internet.

      Look. You don't even
   know what you want to do.

    Why don't you just take
   a year or two off, travel,

  you know, go abroad? That's
 what I did after high school.

Loved it. Totally found myself.

    -That costs money, too.
      -Oh, not that much.

   I always found a place to
   crash for a night or two.

  [Kate] Got it. Thanks, guys.

           Hmm. Heh.

      She'll be OK, right?

         Probably not.

        Hey. Thank God.

      I was gonna kill you
     if you didn't show up.

   Let's get today over with.
       I hate it already.

         Oh, I'm sorry.

        Do you guys have
        difficult lives?

           Try living
   on a teacher's salary, OK?

   It feels like my jeans are
    made out of Tupperware.

        Morning, people!

       Bear, you're late.

  It's Saturday. I overslept.

     Unrelated statements.

How are you this bitchy on a...

     <i> â™ª Saturday morning? â™ª</i>

     Everybody on the bus.

       - What's up, Bear?
      - What's up, my man?

        Go on, brother.


             - Hi.
           - Morning.

         - My brother!
            - Yeah!

        - Morning, Bear.
             - Boo.

             - Hi.
       - Good to see you.

     [Bear] I got one free
       ticket to hugtown.

       - Do you want it?
         - Rain check.

     Come on. We gonna stop
    to get something to eat?

    My stomach's grumbling.

      I've never seen food
      these colors before.

    Ugh. Looks like somebody
     already ate that once.

          Oh, my God!
    It smells like it, too.

  Do you want a trail mix bar?

         - I have two.
        - Yeah, I guess.

            Oh, ho!

        This is awesome.

     Well, we had a little
    time before we got back

          on the road,
   and kids did great today,

so thought it would be a special
  treat at The Flavor Circus.

       Oh, is that beef?
         Dude, protein!

    Yeah! About to put this
     place out of business!

     Ha ha! Thanks, Mrs. G.

     You're quite welcome.

            Really,
the pleasure's mine today, kids.

I feel like Mrs. Claus. Heh heh.

   And it's Christmas morning
      for all of you guys.

          - Ohh! Baby!
            - What?

         We should make
      each other's plates.

          Oh, my God!
  Why didn't I think of that?

   You know what? You always
      have the best ideas.

       Such a good idea.

  - Here I come, here I come.
         - Oh, stop it!

   [boy] The buffet's symbol
   of Western overindulgence.

      This is why the rest
     of the world hates us.

   Trevor, just put something
     on your plate, please.

      My name is Beowulf!

              Err!

     Is that clams casino?

      [boy] Babe, this is
        the best dinner

     that I have ever had.
        You're a genius.

    - Baby, you're a genius.
           - Stop it.

   I feel like my taste buds
 are falling in love with you.

          Oh, stop it.

          [Goldstein]
     So did everyone enjoy

      the Picasso exhibit
       as much as I did?

       [Chad] Not really.
        That guy sucked.

 None of his stuff looked like
    what it was supposed to.

      It's called cubism!

   Should be called dumbism.

        Ha ha ha! Boom!

     He combined styles to
  paint things as he saw them,

          not as they
      were seen by others.

     He broke all the rules
       to prove a point.

That is essentially what art is.

        Thank you, Abby.

     That's exactly right,
   and some of his paintings

     are the most expensive
       in the world today

      and sell for upwards
        of $150 million.

        Go to your room!

        For a painting?

 I got to start painting again.

        Yeah, seriously.
   We got to get out of here,

go steal one of those paintings,

  sell it on the black market.

           Who's in?

          [Goldstein]
    Very funny, Wanda Sykes.

    Now, everybody, eat up,
       and let's get back

          on that bus.

   I'm getting one more bowl
        of marshmallows,

   pinto beans, and craisins,

  and then we are out of here.

         I don't know.
      How are you feeling?

     I'm fine. Are you OK?

I think it was that food we ate.

   It's making me feel sick.

          Sitting like
    a pine cone in my colon.

          [Goldstein]

        are you guys OK?

            - Fine.
  - No. I'm scarred for life.

   Shut up, shut up, shut up.

     OK. Guys, don't panic.

   Everybody's gonna be fine.

       You're not dying.

    We're a little car sick
   from all the bumpity bumps

          of the bus.

We're gonna get some fresh air,
     enjoy the parking lot,

    and then get right back
          on that bus.

 Listen. It's not gonna happen.

    I can't drive like this.

        We got to spend
        the night here.

    Bear, give me your keys.
    I'm gonna drive the bus.

  - No. I'm gonna lose my job.
Bear, I'm gonna drive the bus.

  You don't know how to driv--
    this is a large machine.

   - I'm gonna drive the bus!
     - You're not licensed.

     You could kill us all

    if you already haven't.

           [Kate] So?

       Don't you remember
 from biology class last year,

       -the butterflies?
              -No.

    They both look the same,
   but only one is dangerous,

     so since the predators
 can't tell which one is which,

  they just leave both alone.
 It's like a defense mechanism.

     Well, uh, doubt these
     are their real names.

  A lot of, uh, working girls
 use this motel to turn tricks.

       Trust me, they're
        not butterflies.

      Uh, they're hookers.

              Oh.

           Oh, yeah.

      And it looks like we
   have four rooms available.

        I'm not a driver

  I don't care if aliens come
       down to invade us,

I don't care if there's a ghost
   in the hallway screaming,

      "Help me, help me,"

      and then he gets in
        and he kills you

    and you become a ghost.

    You as a ghost will not
     be leaving the rooms.

         Jessie, you're
       with your brother.

    -We're switching rooms.
   -Chad, you're with Jesse.

     You two are together,
   and, Bear, you're with me.

         Hey. We'll get
     through this together.

              No.

       Ahh. You ever here
       of, uh, Van Gogh?

   Yeah, of course. The, uh,
   Dutch post impressionist.

       I have line on one
   of his missing paintings.

   I think it's called <i> Boy,</i>
   uh, <i> Pissing on Sunflowers</i>

         or something.

   Pretty sure that's not it.

         I don't know.
      I'm not homosexual.

  Anyway, I know where it is,
        and I have buyer

   willing to pay two million
      for it cash tonight.

       It's just sitting
        in some old safe

 in some real estate company's
     liquidation facility,

     which is why I'm going
         to swap it out

     with replica tonight.

   OK. Are you sure these two
     are the stealthy team

     -you want on this job?
           -You nuts?

 I hire couple of pros on this,
      the same ones who do

        the museum heist
  in Amsterdam broad daylight,

 dressed as tourists, you know?

 Oh, I think I read about them.

    Anyway, Ari reaches out,
         they say yes.

   All you got to do is pick
   them up, make a few stops,

      wait for them while
        they do the job,

and make sure you get back here
   before my buyer gets here.

     You get hundred large,
    I get to start new life

           in Brazil!

          Why Brazil?

 Very loose banking regulations

      and fastest growing
    recreational activity--

        roller skating.

I'm going to take the money and
        build new rink,

    my dream rink, perfect.

       Not oval, circle.

           So you in?

           - I'm in.
             - Yes!

       Thank you, Wheels.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

    Where are they staying?

         Down the road
      at the Crest Motel.

     They are under names,

  uh, Monarch and "Wis-a-roy,"
            I think.

           - Viceroy.
         - Wheels, go!

   They're expecting you. Go!

           All right,
    but this is my last job.

      After this, lose my
     number and my e-mail.

     Don't try to Tweet me.

I'm unfriending you on Facebook,

    and definitely don't try
   to follow me on Instagram.

           Snapchat?

          OK. Just go.
   Keep mouth shut and drive.

          Hey, bozos.

        What's up, boss?

   Make sure everything goes
    exactly as planned, OK?

             Yeah.

Anything goes wrong, kill them,

     and before you leave,
         polish these.

      Polish, not Polish.

         Polish these.

       This isn't so bad.

    At least we're not sick.

          Heh. Funny.

        You want to use
         the bathroom?

           I'm done.

        Nope. I'm good.

        You're not gonna
       get ready for bed?

  What do you mean? What do I
have to do to get ready for bed?

          I'm in bed.

    OK. What's up with you?

       I don't think I'm
      gonna go to college.

        Are you serious?
            Why not?

       I mean, I've been
       thinking about it,

     and I don't even know
       what I want to do

  with my life yet, so why not
   just take a few years off

and travel abroad or something?

   Kate, everybody knows that
   take a couple years off to

   travel abroad really just
   means going and get drunk

    and hook up with a bunch
       of foreign dudes.

    You're better than that,
    and college is all about

 where you figure out what you
   want to do with your life.

You're just so lucky you already
   know what you want to do.

     You're gonna be, like,
   the first female president

     one day or something.

         Hopefully not.
   There are currently a lot

       of qualified women
      serving in Congress.

          I'm hungry.

Me, too. Want to order a pizza?

       No. I want to get
          out of here,

        and I want to go
     somewhere nice, and...

  it's gonna be on my parents.

           - Really?
           - Why not?

    I mean--OK, technically,
     it is for emergencies,

  but seriously, if this isn't
     an emergency, what is?

  How are we gonna get there?

   I'll just order us a ride.

  I'll even say our names are
      Viceroy and Monarch

     like the butterflies,
        not the hookers.

        Hold on. What if
         we get caught?

  We're not gonna get caught.
   I'm not gonna tell anyone,

      and you're not gonna
          tell anyone.

         My clothes are
       covered in vomit.

       I guess that means
          we should go

       to a thrift store.

      OK. That is actually
       such a good idea.

        We haven't done
        that in so long.

See? We'll just go really quick,
    we'll have a nice dinner

  and some new fresh clothes,
           come back,

      and no one will even
       know we were gone.

      Well, I did find one
       that's still open.

      And there's already
       a ride on its way.

        We have to be so
    careful leaving, though.

   If Miss Goldstein sees us,
         we're screwed.

   Oh, my God. I do not think
   we have anything to worry

         about with her
  or anyone else here tonight.

            Oh, God!

  Get out, get out, get back!

     Babe, if you love me,
    get out of the bathroom!

    Chad, I'm gonna explode!

        - Get ouuuuttt!
           - No, no!


       Do you hear that?

        [Bear groaning]

         What are they
        doing in there?

 Let's go over the plan again.

 - I downloaded the building--
         - Don't worry.

          We got this.

   Ari's gonna lead us right
       to The Collector.

    Now let's just hope that
      guy Ari's sending as

       a driver is a pro.

Well, if he isn't, we shoot him.

          In the leg.

   You didn't let me finish.

  All right. It's time. Ready?

              Yep.

         Wait. Hold on.

         I got to pee.

    Hi. Are you our driver?

     I don't know. Depends.

   We're Viceroy and Monarch.

  Can we just get out of here?

      We don't want anyone
       to see us leaving.

        Whoa, what? OK.

      Be cool. All right.

     Just a couple hotties.

       Just be yourself.
    Be cool, Brian, be cool.

          Hi. Are you
      Monarch and Viceroy?

    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

      - Are you Monarch--
          - No names.

  That's rule number one, OK?

       OK. There's rules.

  I love that. That's awesome.

      What is, uh--what's
        rule number two?

      Don't ask questions.

      As you can imagine,
    discretion's a big part

         of what we do.

     Oh, yeah. I get that.

         Yes, I totally
        get--I get that.

      I get what she said.

    I like it. I'm into it.

           Ha ha ha!

  Yeah. I love to be discreet.

       I get that a lot.

    My friends are all just
   like--I'm crazy discreet.

 Is there a rule number three?

          Yeah. Drive.

  I cannot believe I actually
  just got you out right now.

     Calm down. I can make
     him turn around still.

         No, you can't.
      We're not going to,

       and plus, this car
    is actually pretty sick.

      Yo, sick car, dude.

           All right.
    So, uh, where we going?

     Oh. Um, could you take
        us here, please?

      Yeah. What's there?

     Let's just say we have
    to settle an old score.

    [Brian] So I got water,
          I got mints,

      I got breath strips,
  I got a really sick Spotify

    if you guys like music.

    Anything you guys want,
       just let me know.

    I'm here to please you--
      or please, you know?

       Thanks. No water.
   Just drive and don't talk.

     OK. Cool, cool, cool.

    So where you guys from?

        In town on, uh,
     business or pleasure?

      Or I guess pleasure
    is your business, right?

           Ha ha ha!

             What?

       Nothing. Nothing.
        I'm--I'm sorry.

       I should--I--what
      am I--listen to me.

    I'm asking--I ask a lot
     of questions sometimes

 when I get nervous, you know?

     Not that I'm nervous.
 I'm calm, you know, I'm cool.

  My friends are always like,
   "Oh, Brian, he's so cool.

    You got to meet Brian."

 So, like, don't even sweat it,
           you know?

     It's just I'm saying--
  I'm saying I'm open-minded.

   So anything you guys want,
       just let me know.

    Look. Just do your job.

     No one will get hurt.

          OK. Got it.

   I'm gonna text Ari and let
    him know we're in play.

       Yeah, and tell him
     the driver's annoying.

        Driver. Are you
       guys talking golf?

      [cell phone chiming]

              Heh.

        Yes. Here we go.

        That's the spot.

       I'll be right here
        when you get out

   unless you want me to wait
       in the back alley.

   No. It's OK. This is fine.

        [Kate] You sure
        want to do this?

      Once we go in there,
    there's no turning back.

          - I'm sure.
          - Oh, yeah?

            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

            - Yeah.
            - Yeah?

           - Mm-hmm.
            - Yeah?

            - Yeah.
            - Yeah?

            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

           I mean...

          [both] Yeah!

 [Abby] Now remember the rules.

      I'll whatever outfit
    you pick just as long as

 it's not too slutty or dirty.

    You can't tell everyone
        it's a joke like

       you did last time.

        That's cheating.

     OK. It's not cheating
       if it's the cops.

   First one to break loses.

            - Deal?
            - Deal.

         What the hell
      are they doing here?

        It's so obvious.

   They're buying disguises.

        Check this out.

   Says right here they were
     dressed up last time.

   Right, man, but the point
     is we could have done

      this job ourselves.

         Uh-huh. Look.

       They were orphans
     trained by the Yakuza.

      Sounds about right.

             Yeah.

            - Right?
            - Yeah.

   Everything on the Internet
            is true.

          Is this it?
    I think that this is it.

    This is fine. Just wait
    for us here, all right?

 OK. Well, I mean, this doesn't
 look like a safe neighborhood.

     Are you sure you girls
        are gonna be OK?

     What did we say about
       asking questions?

         Oh. Uh, what--
       I don't remember.

         - What was it?
    - It's safe, I promise.

     Just stay in the car,
     don't talk to anybody.

We'll be back in a few minutes.

             phone?

            - Sure.
             - No.

 [Brian] I just want to talk to
         some buddies.

    Tomorrow, me and a bunch
         of my friends,

     we're going skydiving,
 which I'm pretty jazzed about

        because I love,
      like, extreme stuff.

  I'm, like, live on the edge.

         I'm just like
   an extremist--sportswise,

        not politically.

      I--all right, girls.

           All right.
     Let me do the talking.

              OK.

              Da?

         We're here to
        see The Painter.

             Nyet.

           Good job.

         - Oh, come on.
          - Too slow.

 What in the good Lord's name?

        [Kate] You have
      never looked better.

    I would totally hire you
   to be my personal trainer.

     Mmm. I think I'm more
        of a life coach,

         but thank you.

   I would totally marry you.

      Let's see how dinner
       goes first, honey.

  Hey. Sorry it took so long.

          No worries.
       Get what you need?

       Yeah. We think so.

       What do you think?

         I don't know.

   Come on. You can tell us.

        We look awesome.

         Where to next?

          - I had it.
   - Yeah, I'm sure you did.

      You can't just break
         someone's nose

      every time something
      doesn't go your way.

 Somebody could have seen that
      and called the cops.

I told you, I'm more than happy

    to teach you some moves.

      It's not that hard.

      I know how to fight.
        I prefer not to.

            Boring.

       Master, somebody's
        here to see you.

          Is he dead?

        [man] No. The--
    The Painter is resting.

       The Painter smells
        like he's dead.

          "Kreh-tos"?

        "Krah-tos," sir.
     We've talked about it.

          - Kreh-tos--
          - Krah-tos.

          - Kreh-tos.
          - Krah-tos.

      Kray-ah-tos. Say it.
          You say it.

           -Krah-tos.
         -Kray-ah-tos.

      We said the exact--
  it sounds exactly the same.

            No. Ah.

       It doesn't matter,
     and didn't I tell you

not to wake me when I'm clearly
            working?

      [Kratos] Sorry, sir.
    They, uh--they insisted.

              Man.

        You hit Kratos.

         Who does that?
     He's a big teddy bear.

             - Sir.
         - Ari sent us.

       [The Painter] Oh.

       Well, well, well,
    well, well, well, well.

       Well, well, well,
       well, well, well.

          Well, well,
       well, well, well.

    Well, well, well, well.

       Well, if it isn't
   Viceroy and the other one.

        It's a delight.

              Hi.

      Yes. May I help you?

 [Abby] Table for two, please.

   Do you have a reservation?

         Right. I see.

      Well, I wish we had
    a table for you, but...

           I do not.

       [Kate] "I do not"?

 Did you just say, "I do not"?

      Oh, my--oh, my God.

      That's exactly what
   Jason said at my wedding!

     "I do not, I do not"!

              Aah!

         My meatballs.

           My dress!

           [whimpers]

         You know what?
    They can have our table.

        We'll come back
         another night.

      [The Painter grunts]

           Oh, yeah.

          [urinating]

   I tell you, I'm a big fan.

            [pbbttt]

             Whoa.

 What you guys did in Amsterdam
      was just next level.

           Thank you.
      It was all my idea.

    Oh, yeah? I don't care.

           [Monarch]
     So what is this place?

 I mean, the money you charge,
   and this is how you live?

    No toilets, no windows.

        I got a window.

    Yeah, that's a painting.

   Heh. I think I would know
     the difference between

    a painting and a window.

        Anyway, this is
       not where I live.

       This is my office.

      You know, I have to
      live like an artist,

       I have to breathe
        like an artist,

         I have to eat
        like an artist,

        I have to smell
        like an artist,

     dance like an artist,

      talk like an artist,

do this gesture like an artist.

        I can't do that
          at my house.

     You know what I mean?

    - I'm a method painter.
           - A what?

  A method painter, you know,
      like a method actor,

        except I paint.

      It's pretty--I would
    get that the first time

        someone said it.

Jesus. Did you cut your ear off?

   "Got to feel pain in order
     to work with colors."

         Maya Angelou.

       Yeah. I think you
      should probably see

      a doctor about that.

     You're kind of pretty.

     I'd like to draw you,
 give you a nice pencil twirl.

         You interested
       in a nude drawing?

         You don't have
         to get naked.

    I'll just get naked and
           draw you.

           Yeah. No.

        Do you have what
          we came for?

             - Huh?
Do you have what we came for?

             What?

  Of course. You think I don't
     have my shit together?

    You know, when Ari first
   told me that he found it,

   I was like, "Yeah, right."

     But when he hired you,
        he certainly hit

     a ground-rule double.

          <i> â™ª Oh, oh â™ª</i>

        Can you see it?

   Can you see the painting?

 And the wood and metal's aged?

  It will pass carbon testing?

        Oh, yeah. Yeah,
    all that stuff you said.

   You know, I was rock hard
    for all 12 hours it took

         to paint this.

      Yeah. We got to go.

         Appreciate it.

    I'd get that ear looked
    at as soon as possible.

 Oh, and I'm sorry about that.

        This isn't over.

      Yeah, I think it is.

      Get some ice on it.

          Thanks, bro.

     You're a good person.

     Take a picture of me.

    I have a strong feeling
    this is exactly what I'm

        gonna look like
   on my actual wedding day.

       Pfft. As if you're
       gonna get married.

        Are you serious?

        Now I'm not even
    smiling in the picture.

             - OK.
      - All right. Got it.

      Just send it to me.

 I still haven't gotten it yet.

It still isn't in my phone yet.

          - Calm down.
    - Have you sent it yet?

    Do you realize there was
     a period of time where

    people didn't even have
      cell phones at all?

      I wasn't alive then.

         Neither was I.

      So how do you know?

         [man] Bonsoir!

         Good evening.

      My name is Theodore,
    and I'll be your server

       for this evening.

     Before we begin, I am
    going to have to remind

  you to remove your headwear.

 We do have a dress code policy
      at this restaurant.

   This doesn't mean I lose.

        It kind of does.

           Thank you
      for your compliance.

        We may now begin
     a culinary adventure,

     but first, I'll leave
  you with these, your guides

       for this evening,

       for you to peruse
        at your leisure.

And I will very quickly tell you

   about tonight's specials.

      Tonight, we feature
    an Alaskan salmon slowly

   marinated in a balsam-sick
     vinaigrette reduction

     and then flash cooked.

      It's very dangerous
      but very delicious.

              Mmm.

           [inhales]

             Damn.

      I'll be right back,
      but please remember

        our policy here.

       No GMOs, yes OMGs.

    Was that guy even real?

        Oh, there--there
         are my girls.

    I was just worried sick.
  I mean, not worried. I was--

    What were you thinking?
  It was not safe back there.

      Relax. Everyone got
       what they wanted.

    Relax? It was bad enough
   you had to do the bouncer.

  Who knows how many more guys
 he could have had back there?

      What would you have
    done then, do them all?

    Yeah. If I had to, yeah,
       I'll do them all.

      I can handle three,
 I can handle four, no problem.

         Good for you.

              Huh.

  Kate, are you sure it's OK?

       This restaurant's
       really expensive.

   I mean, I know you're mad
         at your folks,

   but their appetizers cost
      more than my house.

    I seriously don't care.

      Let's just have fun.

         OK. I'm down.

      I hope everyone's OK
       back at the motel.

     I'm sure they're fine.

     "Though I walk through
    the valley of the shadow

   of death, I fear no evil,
     for you are with me."

            [pbbttt]

            No more.

              Oh.

           OK. Yeah.

            [pbbttt]

       Her name is Carly,

not iCarly, but for years--heh--

   I got so confused by that.

      What are you saying?

      What are you saying?

          Hee hee hee!

          [Goldstein]
     iCarly? No. YouCarly.

        [both laughing]

     Can I get you started
    with anything to drink?

      Let's do champagne.
    It's been a rough week.

   Champagne. Yes. Of course.

       I'll just need to
      see some photo I.D.

  We'll just have two waters,
            please.

   Actually, make that three.

    I got to get this stain
          off me stat.

       Excellent choice.

      [Wheels] I miss you,
  too. I miss you, too, baby.

         Heh. Hey, hey.
         Send me a pic.

          Yeah, yeah.

             [ding]

Tsk. Girl, I meant of the baby.

           Ha ha ha!

     I'm messing with you,
     I'm messing with you.

          Oh. Hold on.
      I got another call.

      I got to take this.

 Hold on. Do not hang up, baby.

   Do not hang up, all right?

            - Yeah.
        - Hey. It's me.

       Hey. What up, Ari?

 [Ari] Oh, nothing much, buddy.

    I'm just checking to see
    how your night is going.

         Must be pretty
       weird to be back.

This is just one job, all right?

     But thanks for asking,
     though, Ari, you know,

   because at first I thought
   it would be kind of weird.

       Wheels, get real!

          I don't care
     about your night, OK?

        I need updates,
        I need updates!

   All right. Well, nothing's
   really happened yet, man.

      I mean, it's kind of
     weird stuff actually.

    They got some disguises,
      and now they got me

        waiting outside
      of some restaurant.

OK, OK. They're weird. It's OK.

      What are they like?
         Are they hot?

     Hey. Tell them to come
     over here afterwards.

      I got hot tub fixed.

          Dude, what's
        wrong with you?

    What? You can come, too.
      There's two of them.

         I'm out, man.

       Baby? Booga-booga!

     Wheels, I'm not wife.

          Thanks, Ari.

        OK. Here we are.

          OK, weirdo.
      You know the drill.

     [Brian] Again? My God,
  you girls must be exhausted.

OK, but real talk for a second.

    I need to get a burrito
          or something

        because my blood
       sugar is crashing.

       I'm hyperglycemic,
           so if I--

         - Bye, Brian.
      - It's a condition.

    OK. Yeah, no. I'll just
    stay here while my body

 eats itself and I slowly die.

  Don't worry about old Brian.

          I'm stuffed.

     I don't think I'm ever
     gonna be hungry again.

            Me, too.

    Guten abend, Frauleins.

  Have you enjoyed everything?

            Mm-hmm.

  Will there be anything else?

         Perhaps a cup
      of our house coffee.

   Each bean is hand-picked--

 - Aw, thanks, Teddy, but, uh--
          - Theodore.

   Just gonna take the bill.

           Thank you.

     This was so much fun.

       I seriously don't
        want it to end.

       I know. Me either.

      What else can we do?

      I will literally do
       whatever you want.

           Anything?

 As long as this night doesn't
    end, let's do anything.

  I mean, it would be a shame
    to waste these outfits.

      We do look amazing.

          Yeah, we do.

  That was so fun. Great idea.

      I know. I just wish
  I got this stain off of me.

  Dude, you can hardly see it.
     Don't worry about it.

   Baby, I say we home school
            our kid.

Look. I'm down for home college,
     you know what I mean?

     Oh, I got to go. Hey.
     What happened to you?

         You all right?
    What happened in there?

        Oh, you said you
      could barely see it.

     You can't, you can't.

  I hate to see what happened
       to the other guy.

         So can we make
       a few more stops?

        Do we have time?

We do if you drive fast enough.

     You didn't say nothing
         but the word.

   Just get the ball rolling.

           One like.

     Now we wait. Heh heh.

    [Kate] This is awesome.

    I don't know about this.

         Are you sure?

        Are you serious?

      We have to remember
      this night forever.

   We could just take a bunch
   of pictures or something.

         No. Those will
    disappear in the iCloud.

   This needs to be permanent
      like our friendship.

        All right. Fine,
   but my dad's gonna kill me

        if he finds out.

        I wasn't asleep.

        I wasn't asleep,
        was not asleep.

    I was dealing with some
      important inventory.

         What's--whoa!

       What is happening?

           Oh, wait.
       I--OK. I'm sorry.

        OK. Oh, you guys
         are on drugs.

    No. We're not on drugs.

   Me neither up until a few
   weeks ago when I found out

 I was eight months' pregnant,
       but, um--pbbblll--

       it's like you live
    and you learn, you know,

          on that one.

  We just want to get tattoos.

 She does. I'm still not sure.

     You know I want to get
      a real job someday,

       and statistically
        speaking, people

      with tattoos really
      limit their options.

            Thanks.

   Sorry. I didn't mean that.

[tattoo artist] All right. Look.
        Here's my book.

Look through it, see if anything
   kind of jumps out at you,

  but I don't do tramp stamps
       or Chinese symbols

unless you happen to be Chinese.

    These are really great.

           Thank you.

          Oh, my God.
       Look at this one.

       It looks just like
     a penis or something.

             Ha ha.

      It's a rocket ship.

       [Wheels] Oh, yeah.
         I see a rocket

       with balls on it.

   I love space exploration.

         She does. OK.

       Why don't we just
        do butterflies?

   [Abby] That's not too bad.

           - Really?
           - Mm-hmm.

     All right. Tat us up.

      OK. Two butterflies.

     I will try not to make
     them look like penises

          with wings.

           Excuse me.

    All right. I texted Ari,
let him know we made the switch.

              OK.

       Look at this guy.

         Huh? What? Yo.

           [Viceroy]
      Hey. Open the trunk.

         [siren blips]

             Shit.

   Oh, no. What is going on?

    Yeah. All right, Rocky.
          Go get them.

         I'll be quick.

      [officer] Excuse us.
     What's going on here?

           [grunting]

      Oh, God! Oh, my God!

              Aah!

    [Brian] Oh, my God! Aah!

          [car starts]

     What is happening? No!

          Ohhh, shit!

           Aah! Aah!

       What is he doing?

       [Brian] Ugh! Ohh!

         You got this,
      you got this, buddy!

              Aah!

       [tires squealing]

      [car alarm blaring]

 He is the worst getaway driver
        I've ever seen.

       No argument here.

  I wish I had my contacts in.

          You're done.

       Oh, it is so cool!

 I love it so much. Thank you.

    Oh, you are so welcome.
        It looks really,

     - really good on you.
           - I know.

           All right,
    Buzz Aldrin, you're up.

     I don't know anymore.

        What do you mean
    you don't know anymore?

        We made a deal,
and I have a tattoo on my foot.

   I didn't sign a contract.
 I don't want to do it anymore.

  What do you mean a contract?
      We're best friends.

        We don't need to
        sign a contract.

    It's already engraved in
           our heart.

  It's a friendship contract.

            Exactly.

    Fine, fine. Let's do it.

           Whatever.
     I don't care anymore.

        Ink me. Come on.

   Ink me hard. Let's do it.

        Hey! You need to
         calm down, OK?

     I'm hung-over. Please.

              OK.

   [Viceroy] <i> Start talking.</i>

        [muffled shouts]

     You can probably take
   the gun out of his mouth.

       What is happening?
    What are you guys doing?

     Why do you have guns?
        What's going on?

         Don't kill me.
     Please don't kill me.

        I want to live!

       I changed my mind.
        Put it back in.

      Tell us everything.

     I don't know anything.

         Start talking.

        [Brian] OK, OK.
       I have five cats.

          I love them.

 I also love romantic comedies
      and--and reality TV.

       I binge watch it.

       I find it calming,
     and-- and--and I'm not

    skydiving tomorrow, OK?
       I lied about that.

          I don't have
     an extreme lifestyle.

      As a matter of fact,
     I would never skydive.

        I hate heights,
    I don't like parachutes.

   Flying makes me nauseous.

     Please don't kill me.

        Did Ari tell you
         to rip us off?

        Who--who is Ari?

   You heard of The Painter?

        I know painters.

          Rembrandts,
    the Ninja Turtles, sure.

     [Viceroy] Wait. If you
    don't know Ari, why were

    you at the Crest Motel,
      and how did you get

 the names Viceroy and Monarch?

         Because I had
      a pickup there, OK?

       Those--those were
 the names on the pickup form.

        I'm sorry I was
       two minutes late.

          Pickup form?
  What are you talking about?

         I am a driver
    for a rideshare company,

   or at least I was a driver
    for a rideshare company

    because I'm surely gonna
    get fired now if I live.

       Not to mention my
     dad's gonna freak out

  because this is his car, OK?

       I lied about that.

  I lied about having friends.

   I don't even have friends.

          I'm a loser.

  The five cats are my world.

    Please, please, listen.

  I thought that if maybe we--
     we were cool with each

  other you guys would like me
       and be my friends,

   and maybe that would turn
      into something where

      you guys would maybe
       have sex with me.

             What?

     Because you're--you're
     prostitutes, you know,

      women of the night!

     We're not prostitutes,
           you moron.

     We're undercover FBI.

           Like--like
    Female Body Inspectors?

     My dad has that shirt.

    We got in the wrong car.

We have to go back to the motel
        and look through

       security footage.

    We got in the wrong car.

   Who got in the right one?

           Yes. Wow.

       I think I just got
    the hang of it on yours.

    It's so good. Thank you!

        You know, you're
     actually really cool.

     Aw. I'm so sorry about
     all that stuff I said

     when I first got here.

     I don't get out much.

   No. It's OK. You're young.

        I get it because
        I'm young, too.

It's like we're peers, you know?

  No. I--I think I'm younger.

          Eh, agree to
     disagree on that, OK?

    OK. So I got to ask you,

 what is up with these outfits?
        You look insane.

   You look like you had your
  period and then splashed it

       back on yourself.

   No. I stopped doing that.

      We're actually just
        on a field trip

 for our AP art history class.

   Everyone got really sick,

    but we decided to go out

  and actually have some fun.

    Oh, OK. Field trip, huh?

    Where are you guys from?

      Ugh. Lake Arrowhead.

     Really? Wait. No way.

 What high school do you go to?

            - Dixon.
           - Get out!

         Get right out.

            Get out!
     Wait! I went to Dixon!

           - Really?
           - Really?

           Ha! Yeah!
  Dixon High Cougars for life,

          you bitches!

          Oh, my God!
        That is so rad.

  Why didn't you guys tell me
       you went to Dixon?

         Seriously, why
      didn't you tell me?

    Err! Why didn't you guys
    tell me you're Cougars?

       I would have used
         a new needle.

          Oh, my God!
This is, like, blowing my mind!

           You guys.

   Oh, my God! Is that creepy
    gym teacher still there,

          the one with
the thick glasses and no teeth?

         - Mr. Abrams.
         - Mr. Abrams.

     Well, he made me call
      him Badger, which...

       He's in jail now.

    Oh, that's--that's good.

  That's actually really good.

      So what are you guys
      doing after school?

I'm probably gonna go to college
   for poli sci in the fall.

    - Because you're smart.
            - Yeah.

    Yeah. I'm probably gonna
      take a few years off

       and travel abroad,
      really find myself.

    OK. I think we all know
     that means you're just

        gonna get wasted
     and hook up with guys

   - who don't speak English.
  - [Abby] That's what I said.

            - Right?
            - Yeah.

            We have
 something. Two little besties.

      Yeah. She's a slut.

    Ha ha ha! You know what?

         You guys wait
    right here, old Cougars.

        I got something
        to show you, OK?

              OK.

      Get the old gal up.

             - Ooh.
           - Got it.

        Ha ha ha! Whoo!

Lightheaded. The doctor told me
        to stop working,

      but I was like, "No!
  You stop working." Ha ha ha!

           BRB, guys.

    Heh. You two are a trip.

     How did you know about
   that Lake Arrowhead stuff?

       What do you mean?

  I mean, did you make it up,
       did you Goggle it?

     Like, how did you know
       she went to Dixon?

      We didn't make it up
    because it's the truth.

  Yeah, right. You're a couple
      of high school girls

          down here on
   a art history field trip?

        AP art history.

           Ha ha ha!
      You messing with me.

     She's good. Ha ha ha!

            - What?
            - What?

  So what are your real names?

           I'm Kate.

  I'm Abby. What's your name?

             Andy.

        Nice to formally
        meet you, Andy.

       Nice to meet you.
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

      So how did you know
   about Viceroy and Monarch?

      Yeah. We just saw it
     on an envelope when we

    checked into the motel.

    I mean, it was my idea.

     I was the one who put
    it into my phone, so...

         We got to go.

       We got to go now.
   Put your foot in the shoe.

Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

           Let's go!

       Man, I got to pee.

      OK. Can you hold it?

      Hold it? Man, I been
        holding it, man.

      You're just hearing
         about it now.

     A grown man telling me
        to hold my pee.

           OK. Sorry.

        Why don't you go
      outside, grown man?

      Go outside? Come on.
        I can't do that.

        So uncivilized.

       I met you in jail,
    but that's uncivilized.

 It's Ari, it's Ari, it's Ari.

              OK.

          - Ari, hey.
          - It's done?

         Is what done?

        <i> How many things</i>
   <i> are you doing right now?</i>

       Oh, right, right.

         Right--ha ha.
       He's doing a bit.

       They haven't done
       anything yet, Ari.

      We're still watching
        and surveilling.

       What do you mean?

       <i> Uh, they got some</i>
    <i> clothes, they went into</i>

    an artisinal restaurant,
       and so now they're

        getting tattoos.

            Tattoos?

   I know they hit the place.

     I got text from them.

   What the hell is going on?

      Are they paying you
         to play dumb,

 or are you doing it for free?

      Mr. "Airy," we been
   sitting on them all night.

       We'd have seen it.

         It's "Ar-ee,"
        and no "mister."

         Jesus Christ.
     Something's happening.

  I bet Wheels is in on this.

           I knew it!

   Bring them all to me now!

             - Who?
             - Err!

    [Ari] Who do you think?

     Wheels and the broads!

         Are you high?

           He's good.
  We're gonna take care of it.

   We'll talk to you so soon,
        and I thank you.

            Idiots!

            Come on.
    Let's go. We got to go.

     Guys? My little kids?

             Hello?

  Did I just imagine all that?

         Did--did we do
        something wrong?

       Are you mad at us?

     [Wheels] Not you. Just
    time to call it a night.

 Wheels, how's it going, buddy?

 What are you guys doing here?

     Oh, I think you know.

   There's been a big mix-up.

    I really think you guys
      should let this go.

    Sorry. Not gonna happen.

       Mr. Ari's orders.

       I'm not gonna let
         you take them.

        Oh, don't worry.
     You get to come, too.

      - What's happening?
        - I don't know.

        Get out of here!

         [both scream]

              Ohh!

        Go get the car!

       Hold on, hold on!

        This dress is a
      nightmare to run in.

            I can't.
     My legs won't let me.

         You're wearing
        workout clothes!

              Aah!

      Come on. Are you OK?

   Stay right there, sweetie.

     What are we gonna do?
     What are we gonna do?

        Where do we go?

           This way!

     [dance music playing]

          - What the?
             - Go!

         Did he see us?

       I don't think so.

  - What the hell is going on?
        - I don't know.

    I just want to get back
   to the motel before anyone

     finds out we're gone.
   We should have never left.

    I can't believe you got
       me into all this!

    I got you into all this?
        Are you serious?

     I didn't plan for this
        to happen, Abby.

       I know you didn't
    plan for this to happen

because you don't plan anything.

      You just do whatever
       the hell you want,

      and let other people
       clean up the mess.

    That's--that's not fair!

    I'm not gonna apologize
    for wanting to have fun.

     If it weren't for me,
   you'd never even have any!

        How is this fun?

        I have a tattoo,
    we almost got kidnapped,

    and we're in the middle
           of a rave.

      This is a bad night!

             Yeah.

     Dude, will you please
       put the gun down?

 Did you not see <i> Pulp Fiction?</i>

          Put it down!

   I got to ask were you guys
        orphans trained

     by the Yakuza ninjas?

             What?

         We're not who
       you think we are.

   It's them, man, it's them!

       Put the gun down!

      [Ari] <i> Where is it?</i>

         Where's what?

       What do you think?

    The painting I paid you
          lot of money

        to steal for me.

      I would hate to kill
     the legendary Viceroy

          and Monarch,
   so please do not make me.

    Those aren't our names.

 We didn't steal any paintings.

         We're just two
      high school students

on an AP art history field trip.

     Oh, what is this now?

    You're only high school
  student on art history trip

      dressed like Madonna
        and Jane Fonda?

             - Who?
           - Shut up.

    I swear. AP art history.

            OK. Heh.

This is how you want to play me.

      You now have exactly
    three seconds to tell me

     what I needs to know.

            - One...
   - We don't know anything!

            - Two...
         - Sir, please.

      Kate, do something.

             Three!

   Fine. You win. You got us.

             What?

          Yeah, what?

Yeah. We're Viceroy and Monarch,

        and we have what
      you're looking for.

 You can put the gun down now.

  Ha ha! I knew it! I knew it!

       I knew it! Brains.

 Just let us go, and we'll come
    back with want you want.

        OK, but no, no.

           Question.

 And please be totally honest.

       Do I look stupid?

              Hmm?

 You really think I let you go,
     both of you walk away?

              No.

You go, your friend stays here,

   and if you don't come back

   before my buyer gets here,

    I will have to kill her.

              OK.

  OK? You can't leave me here.

    I'll be back, I promise.

          Don't leave.

              Go.

 Kate, you can't leave me here.

           Trust me.

 Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

        Kate, Kate, you
      can't leave me here!

             Kate!

     Kate, don't leave me!

        Kate, you can't
         leave me here!

          Kate! Kate!

   [Ari, high-pitched voice]
          Kate, Kate.

  Hush, please. It's annoying.

     [Ari] OK. Tie her up.

     I must make pee-pees.

      What a weird night.

        Congratulations.

  [clerk] Don't you guys need,
        like, a warrant

     for this or something?

   Not if we never saw this.

     [Viceroy] Right there.
        There they are.

 [Monarch] How did that happen?

        You had to pee.
    That's how it happened.

     Damn it. They could be
        anywhere by now.

    Help! Help! I need help.
  My friend, she's in danger.

   I need someone to call the
 police or something right now.

           [panting]

   It's the girl from the TV.

             What?

       [Ari] OK. 50 more.

             Call.

        I'll do 50, too.

         Getting close.
 I hope your partner shows up.

I'd hate to disappoint my buyer.

      OK. What do you got?

   Check this out. Pair aces.

    Ah. Two pair. Got lucky.

       Shit, damn, crap.

     You know what happens
        when I see crap?

  I straight flush it. Ha ha!

 Damn it. Straight flush where?

  - Look at that. Right there.
           - Damn it.

      You should've raised
     before the last card.

 That's when he made his flush
  and he hit his second pair.

     They both had nothing
          before that.

             What?

  This one, he made his flush
       on the river card.

          Am I right?

             Maybe.

          Definitely.

 Impressive. You want to play?

    Come on. Hey...shut up.

   This will be interesting.
  You can play for your life.

   [Kate] I don't know, guys.

   This honestly sounds like
        a terrible idea.

 If anything goes wrong or you
  feel in danger at any point,

   just say, "Safari," and we
   will come in and get you.

            Safari.

     I don't know anymore.
     Can I change my mind?

I'm sorry. You girls interfered
 with a federal investigation,

   so if you and your friend
   want to stay out of jail,

  this is what you have to do.

            Safari.

 [Viceroy] That's the code word
   for us to come in--safari.

          Personally,
 I think you're gonna be fine.

           - Shut up.
          - You ready?

        Safari. Safari.

       - That's the word.
           - Safari.

      That's what's gon--
        Yep. That's it.

  No. I'm saying it right now.
            Safari.

     [Abby] <i> Should I deal?</i>

I'll deal. Your hands are tied.

           [laughter]

             Right.

  [Ari] So, uh, where did you
      learn to play cards?

    I play with my brothers,

   even started a poker club
        in high school.

  Enough with the high school
        stuff, already.

        - I'm not idiot.
       - It's the truth.

    So I suppose you want me
     to believe you're not

this, uh, Viceroy and Monarch or
whatever the hell names you are.

       No. My friend just
        used those names

      because she thought
         it'd be funny.

       I don't even know
  what she's up to right now,

     but I can assure you,
she's not getting any painting.

      [Ari] Ach, garbage.

             Ah...

    - I can prove it to you.
             - How?

  Could I borrow your laptop?
   I'll show you my profile.

       It has everything
     that I told you on it.

          OK. Go get.

        [clears throat]

              See?

          Oh, my God.

        Lake Arrowhead?
     I love Lake Arrowhead.

          - So pretty.
            - Yeah.

  - I almost moved there once.
       - Why didn't you?

  Went to prison instead. OK.

     OK. Says it's private.
      You have to add me.

     Sorry, but I only add
         people I know.

         Ha! I respect
     your privacy settings,

    but, uh, given the fact
  that this is life or death,

 I suspect you make exception.

          Good point.

      Let me just sign in
         really quick.

         Smarty pants.

       Totally understand
    the whole privacy thing.

     You don't want a bunch
       of random weirdoes

  routing through your photos.

           [chuckles]

      You have a Facebook?

 Uh, I'm still over on MySpace.

              My--
        You have a band?

            - Yeah.
      - Your band is lame.

          [Abby] See?

       That's from today.

     Holy crap. Holy crap.

   2,000 friends? Impressive.

      Yeah, pretty popular
      around the Internet.

 Heh. Poker club. Is real. Ha!

 So wait. You are named...Abby?

             - Yep.
             - Hmm.

    - You look like an Abby.
           - I know.

    - Spanish club, pom-pom?
             - Ha!

     You're pom-pom? Prom?

           [laughter]

         Look at this.
  Oh, my God, AP Art History.

   Christ, this is hilarious.
           Ha ha ha!

      She is not gangster.
         She is child.

  That's what I've been trying
  to tell you this whole time.

    We almost killed minor.
           Ha ha ha!

             [man]
   You almost died. Ha ha ha!

       Look at your face.

  I had the plastic laid down
   in my van and everything.

    There's egg on my face.
           Ha ha ha!

     Where is my painting?
      We need my painting!

           Good luck.

           [exhales]

          I don't know
  if she's got what it takes.

           - Shut up.
           - Shut up.

     [Ari] Apologies, kid.
Hell of a mix-up. Cut her loose.

          No worries.

     Look. I'll have my men
    take you back to motel.

 Go home. Don't come back, OK?

            - Deal.
            - Right.

    Hey, hello. This is Ari.

  For-real Monarch or Viceroy,
          please call.

    Emergency. Call me now.
     Damn it. Gosh darn it.

             - Hey.
        - What the hell?

            - Kate?
    - I got what you wanted.

            - What?
             - Yep.

            - What?
         - Here it is.

      Now let my friend go
       like you promised.

      - We're square here.
  - Kate, what are you doing?

     I told him the truth.
   He was about to let me go.

  Don't call me Kate, Viceroy.
     I'm saving your life.

   Whoa, whoa, whoa. Viceroy?

       I--I have no idea
   what she's talking about.

   I'm not Viceroy. I'm Abby.

    I'm so Abby. Look at me.
   You even said so yourself.

   Ha ha ha! I can't believe
          I bought it.

Oh, my God, you two are so good.
      Wowee, wowee, wowee.

       [Kate] We get it.

  I gave you what you wanted.
         Now can we go?

 Ha! I suppose a deal's a deal.

    - Who are you right now?
  - Drop the act. We're beat.

    He's onto us. Can we go?

  You can leave when my buyer
  authenticates this painting.

            Please.

    Little late, gentlemen.

       Now let's see what
    all this noise is about.

   [Abby] Is that a painting?
 Kate, where did you get that?

    You know where I got it,
            Viceroy.

     OK. Have seat. Relax.
         We have time.

     You need soda, chips,
      Chex Mix, pretzels?

       I have everything.

      Wowee, wowee, wowee.

           She's in.

      - Can I have a gun?
             - No.

         It feels like
      I should have a gun.

Oh, we might just pull this off.

          Who's that?

        [tires screech]

   [Ari] Anyone can play CD.
       "Look. I'm band."

      You're basically DJ.

     - Why'd you come back?
   - I came back to save you.

           Great job.

         [Wheels] Ari?

  [Ari] Wheels, what the hell
      are you doing here?

     I thought you would've
           gone AWOL.

      I trusted you, guy.

          Ari, listen.
   You've got to let them go.

          They're not
    who you think they are.

  They're in high school, man.
   I have their real clothes.

    - Ugh, smells horrible.
           - I know.

    There's something wrong
           with them,

   but they're not your pros.

    You got to listen to me.
       I made a mistake.

          Mistake. Mm.

        Perhaps you can
      explain this, then.

              I--

 Wheels, only mistake you make
      is coming back here.

      You are liar, liar,
         pants on fire!

    I don't understand, man.

      When'd you do this?
I was with you the entire time?

Don't ask me. I don't know what
 the hell is going on anymore.

      [Viceroy] That's it.
    He's about to kill them.

   I can't believe I let you
       talk me into this.

       We have to get her
       out of there now.

          - Just wait.
       - I'd love a gun.

     [Wheels] I don't know
   what you told these guys,

          but they're
     very dangerous people,

   so whatever you told them,
    you need to untell them.

        - Oh, ho ho ho!
            - Kate!

         Wowee, wowee.
This is what I'm talking about.

            - Kate?
 - Shut up. My name's Monarch.

            Listen.

  - Even, like, a little gun.
             - Shh.

      This is who you sent
  to pick us up, Ari? Come on.

      Listen. I don't know
  what you think you're doing,

    - but you need to stop--
        - Oh, ho ho ho!

You are the worst criminal I've
  ever worked with in my life.

  Took you about five minutes
   to spill your guts, Andy.

         What? "Andy"?

           - "Andy"?
         - Hello, Andy.

          - Hi, Andy.
    - Hello, Andy. Ha ha ha!

     Oh, it's Raggedy Andy.
           Ha ha ha!

 I told you that in confidence.

      I love these girls.
      Poker club? Please.

          Uh, Wheels--
  excuse me--Andy, take seat.

Ha ha ha! You got bitch-slapped.
          Now you sit.

    Oh, Andy. Shit, I'd want
   to be called Wheels, too.

           [laughter]

           Good girl.

        She's got balls.
        I give her that.

      Is this fun for you?

          Who is that?

         [Vlad Holiday]
 <i> â™ª Romanticize my very being â™ª</i>

   <i> â™ª Till the thought of me</i>
     <i> corrupts the youth â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just want the truth, baby â™ª</i>

    <i> â™ª I just want it a-all,</i>
    <i> I just want it a-all â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I just want the truth, baby â™ª</i>

  That is an awesome pantsuit.

  [Kate] Why'd you come back?

   - I came back to save you.
          - Great job.

         You don't need
     to be slapping people.

     Let's make this quick.

       The jet's leaving
        within the hour.

    - I'd like to be on it.
       - Yes, ma'am. Ari?

         In here. Look.

    I hope, for your sakes,
     this painting's real.

      Keep an eye on them.
         Watch my back.

 Welcome. Thank you for coming.

          Hello, Ari.
   I'm the one you spoke to.

  Ha ha! Wowee, wowee, wowee.
        So much better.

         Who are they?

Oh, this is Viceroy and Monarch.

       They are the ones
    who steal the painting.

   Yeah. I heard about them.

       You guys are gonna
        be huge one day.

    May I get you something
           to drink?

      I have soda, chips,
        so much in back.

    No. I don't need snacks.

   I don't even want to know
 what you have in the back, OK?

The only thing I'm interested in
  is a lost Van Gogh painting.

    Right, right. It's, uh--

              Oh.

 I can't believe you found it.

   <i> Boy Peeing On Sunflowers.</i>

            - Cool.
          - It's real?

  Now let's see if it's real.

             [snap]

        [clears throat]

   [Ari] Of course it's real.

           - Uh-huh.
          - Of course.

   Crazy. There's no painting
          on the back.

            Mm-hmm.

       [Viceroy] Come on,
       come on, come on.

      [Monarch] Why is she
        taking so long?

      - I don't like this.
           - Shut up.

          Mm-hmm. OK.

     Crazy person painted.
         You can tell.

           Good job.

  I never thought that I would
  see this painting in person.

            [sighs]

   Do you know that Van Gogh
          once said--

  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
     Do you have my money?

           Of course.

          Gotcha! Yes.

      I can't believe it.
      It actually worked.

   Right. I'm going in there.

      Hold on. We're gonna
    wait for them to leave.

     But she's right there.

  We're not gonna go in there
     and start a shootout.

These girls are in high school.

      Call it in and have
       a team on standby.

     I'm actually with her
          on that one.

  I think that's a good call.

    I know. I know. Shut up.

You can count it if you like.
         - I trust you.

    You are beautiful woman.

   I, uh, heard this painting
       is worth millions.

   You'll make a lot of money
       when you sell it.

 I already have a lot of money,
     and I'm not gonna sell

 this painting, but I wouldn't
 expect you to understand that.

     You're right. I don't.

     We're done here, Ari.

          [door opens]

           Hey, Ari!

     Ari, I got your money!

How many buyers did you line up?

          None. None.

     Ari, I got your money.

     Would you like to see
         a magic trick?

             - Aah!
      - Get down! Come on!

     Come on out! Let's go!
          Go! Come on!

         What the hell
     is going on in there?

I told you we should've gone in.

     - I'll come with you.
        - You stay here.

         Oh, thank God.
 I don't know why I said that.

      I did not mean that.

     I'll cover the front.
       You take the back.

           All right.
     Hey...watch yourself.

           You, too.

         I'm an idiot.

           [gunfire]

     - You girls all right?
            - Yeah.

      OK. Out on the rink,
 I'm gonna cause a distraction.

              Go!

           [gunfire]

             - Aah!
             - Aah!

             Shit.

    You could've been rich,
      you greedy bastard.

      I didn't set you up.

           He's clown
     with gambling problem.

            Safari!

 Why are you yelling, "Safari"?

  That's what the FBI told me
  to say if we're in trouble.

            The FBI?

     [disco music playing]

    Ha ha! It's party time.

    I ran back to the hotel
       to call the cops,

 but the FBI was already there.

They told me I had to come back
          and do this.

        - What? Safari!
           - Safari!

    You have what you want.
          Just leave.

You better spend all that money
        on disappearing.

    That's the whole point.

         [click click]

     I'm out! We got to go!
            Come on!

          Stupid Red!

    FBI. Drop your weapons.
      Down on the ground.

         Can't shoot us
      if we're not armed.

         [guns clatter]

            Make us.

      Oh...you know what?

      That actually sounds
          really nice.

              Oh!

        FBI. Don't move.

     FBI? Shit, damn, crap.

             - Oh!
             - Aah!

        - You set me up!
            - Sorry!

           [gunshot]

             - Ooh!
             - Go!

             - Uh!
             - Ooh!

              Uh!

 [Abby] Kate, Kate, are you OK?
       Did you get shot?

             Yeah.

           [panting]

            - Oh...
 - Is that a bulletproof vest?

   Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

   - My God, you're an idiot.
           - I know.

    Do you know what happens
    to bitches who snitches?

           - Huh huh!
             - Ah!

  Ari, Van Gogh fuck yourself.

          - Hey, Ari.
           - Uh! Ooh!

    That's it. I'm going in.

 Yargh. I'll wait five minutes.

    I'll wait five minutes.

 Five minutes, then I'll go in.
          Ten minutes.

          Yeah, right.

           Ooh! Ah...

             - Uh!
             - Ooh!

           [gagging]

              Hah!

         - Whoa, nice.
    - Yeah. Well, you know--

    - Where's The Collector?
        - She got away.

   She can't have gotten far.
            Come on.

      [Brian] 15 minutes,
         then I go in.

          Oh, no way.

    That's it. It's go time.

         [Brian] Aaaah!

             What?

             What?

              Yes!

          U.S.A. Yes!

           Oh, ho ho!

    Well, well, well, hello.

        Oh, no big deal,
  just took out The Collector.

 I don't want to talk about it.

      - All right, Brian.
     - Yeah. That's right.

 Now, you see, I saw her there,
     and I knew who she was

   because of what we've been
       saying, and so I--

     I automatically knew.

        You know, I used
       the IPDE process--

       identify, predict,
       decide, execute--

   really hit her hard, too.

   She didn't see it coming.

      The look on her face
     I'll remember forever.

    She's not dead, is she?

        Uh! Damn it. Uh!

              OK.

           All right.

         Hundred large.
    Thanks for the gig, Ari.

      Good luck in Brazil.
      You girls all right?

          We'll live.

Thanks for coming back for us.
      - Sorry about that.

   I really didn't trust you
     until I got back home

    and smelled your clothes
  in the back seat of my car.

   Yeah. We're probably gonna
        need those back.

        [Viceroy] Kate?
      Where are you? Kate!

   Guys, chill. It's the FBI.

     I'm over here. Safari.

    The FBI? What the hell?

           - Freeze.
    - Let me see your hands.

       Hands in the air.

    [Kate] Guys, it's cool.
           It's cool.

  This is Abby. This is Andy.

       He was our driver
   I was telling you about--

       he literally just
       saved our lives--

        and that's Ari.

       Uh-huh. Hey, Ari,
  nice meeting you in person.

       Who are you guys?

        They're the real
      Viceroy and Monarch.

    to pick up at the motel?

             - Yep.
       - And you're cops?

       Well, not exactly.

 We work for an undercover unit
        that specializes

       in recovering lost
      and stolen artwork.

       It's complicated.

   [Wheels] After everything
        that's happened,

        this is probably
the only thing that makes sense.

           - No way.
     - I tried to tell you.

     We should leave before
    the local cops get here.

    I don't want to fill out
      all that paperwork.

 [Viceroy] Yeah. You're right.
     That sounds horrible.

       Am I under arrest?

             - No.
            - No...

      but the three of you
      are coming with us.

     There's one more thing
    we got to take care of.

         Get a move on.

            Coming.

            [sighs]

       Crazy night, huh?

              Yup.

       Are you mad at me?

              No.

      You ready for this?

       Yeah. Let's do it.
    I just want to go home.

          That was it?

  Make it look so much better
         in the movies.

They make losing your virginity
look better in the movies, too.

    Movies are full of sh--

          You guys did
      a great job tonight.

      So what happens now?
       Are we in trouble?

     [Viceroy] No. As long
 as you guys don't tell anybody

  about your involvement here,
   this car is the last link

           between us
   and what happened tonight.

  We won't tell if you won't.

         We made a deal
 when I got back to the motel.

      They said as long as
         I helped them,

    they won't tell anyone.

      You did that for me?

      Someone had to clean
         this mess up.

    [Viceroy] All we wanted
 out of this was The Collector.

      With her in custody,
    we will recover millions

       in stolen artwork.

    See you around, ladies.

     [Brian] What about me?
     What about old Brian?

          You guys put
   a loaded gun in my mouth,

   made me hit a strange lady
       with my dad's car,

    which you just blew up.

        Well, you can't
      win them all, Brian.

         Sucks for you.

         Sucks for me?
   I didn't win any of them.

         I won nothing.
     I didn't win anything.

      Sun's about to rise.

      If my dad finds out
    we went out last night,

       then he finds out,
    doesn't matter anymore.

 [Wheels] We can still make it.
           Let's go.

        [tires screech]

        [tires screech]

   [Wheels] Sorry about that.
         You all right?

Uh, yeah. Don't worry about us.
          We're fine.

  Yeah. We're fine. Go faster.

 [Abby] I can't believe the FBI
   let you blow up that car.

         I know, right?
 I've always wanted to do that.

           - Me, too!
      - It was so badass.

     Even if we get caught,
      it was so worth it.

       [Kate] Yes. Whoa!

    [Wheels] Hey, you're not
       gonna get caught.

    You're going to college,
and Kate, she's going to Europe

        to do her thing
     with a bunch of dudes.

      Oh, my God, I am not
      gonna go to Europe.

  Staying here to do her thing
     with a bunch of dudes.

   I'm not gonna do anything
      with any dudes, OK?

      My parents can't pay
          for college.

     [Abby] Why didn't you
       just tell me that?

   I found out this morning,
    and I'm embarrassed, OK?

   I know how excited you are
         about college.

      I don't want to ruin
       your whole thing.

  Kate, there's really nothing
    to be embarrassed about.

       There are so many
       successful people

     who don't even end up
       going to college,

      and you could go to
community college or something.

   Maybe I'd even stay and go
 to community college with you.

       - What? You would?
          - Hell, no.

        [tires screech]

             - Aah!
             - Aah!

  Ladies, we're getting close.
      Put your clothes on.

            - Gross!
  - Oh, these smell so gross.

        [tires screech]

         - Whoa, Andy!
            - Andy!

          Ha ha! See?
    I told you we'd make it.

   - Hey, we still got time.
        - Thanks, Andy.

        Hey, no worries.

      Uh, maybe we should
   take a second to thank me,

   the one who saved the day.

      What? You smacked me
       in the face twice.

  Yeah, and I was held hostage
           with guns.

     Don't be so dramatic.

  [Wheels] Ha! You know what?

     Actually, I should be
       thanking you guys.

      If you didn't wander
  into my vehicle by mistake,

 I'd be dead or in jail by now,
         so thank you,

 and here's a little something
     for your college fund.

      Oh, are you serious?

         Better take it
    before I change my mind.

    See? Everything's gonna
           work out.

             [Kate]
 Oh, my God, we should go back,

    sell an actual painting
      on the black market.

             [Abby]
     No. We--we need to go.

   - You never listen to me.
         - Bye, Wheels.

           Bye, Andy.

       [cell phone rings]

         Ha ha ha! Oh.
       Hey, boo-boo. Hey.

I--I was just coming home. yeah.

              Hi.

   Thank you for being early,
         Kate and Abby.

  Oh, wow, smells a lot worse
   than yesterday, you guys,

          a lot worse.

        [engine starts]

Yeah, and there's--there's still
    vomit in a couple spots,

       so just be careful
         where you sit.

    [Chad] Bro, I'm so sorry
    I ever made fun of you.

   I was just self-conscious
     about my own identity,

    so I took it out on you.

       No. I was a dick.
       You're a good guy.

   [Goldstein] Jessie, what's
  going on? What's happening?

       Hey, how are you?

        Fine, except for
   I fricking hate everyone.

     What's happening here?
        What's going on?

  How was your night, you two?

          - Uh, uh...
         - Pretty good.

 I mean, you guys probably were
      having a lot of fun,

  but we decided to sneak out

   because it was getting all
            stinky,

and so we got in the wrong car,

    tried to sell a painting
      on the black market.

       The FBI showed up,
   but they were super nice.

        - It was weird.
        - She got shot.

     No. Yeah. Yeah, but it
      was mostly marinara.

        OK. Very funny,
       Paula Poundstone.

      Bear, stop laughing.
Just stay in your seats, please.

        Another awesome
      Saturday night, huh?

        Hey, Goldstein,
  we gonna stop for breakfast?

 No. We're not. No. We're not.

You don't know how to have fun.

          Let's party.
