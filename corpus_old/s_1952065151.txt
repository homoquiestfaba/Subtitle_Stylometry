Open your mouth.

Open your mouth.

How nice, my little boy.
Give daddy a kiss.

You're a beautiful boy,
Emilio...

...l love you so much.

Put that sweet in my mouth.

l want another candy.

Let's go.

You will go and get

lt's your turn to get
them.

One...

...two...

...three.

Get the balls.
Run, Emilio. Run.

Perla...
Take care of Emilio.

l'm going to my radio show.

Juan, l am fed up with all
the gossiping!

l can't stand it anymore.
Niurka, l just want...

...to tell you,
that all your effort...

...to keep your career may
finish with it.

You must be prudent.

Yes, honey.

l see you later.
Send you a kiss. Bye.

Have a nice life.

Juan!

Why don't we take advantage
of the media scandal...

...l'm ready to star
your soap opera.

Besides, we can make the
beautiful story l wrote.

Don't worry, Niurka.
You will be the first one...

...to have an audition
in my next soap opera.

<i>If you ever...</i>

<i>...think of me...</i>

<i>...and feel
in your heart.</i>

<i>If you are...</i>

<i>...ever happy...</i>

<i>I want to ask you
in the name of our love.</i>

Ml VERDAD
A LOVE STORY

<i>I beg you not to hurt it.</i>

<i>When I think of you,
my hands shake...</i>

<i>...you are still here.</i>

<i>If you ever...</i>

<i>...remember the man...</i>

<i>...who gave you his heart...</i>

<i>...in an act of love.</i>

<i>And who always loved you
regardless the past you had.</i>

<i>If anytime...</i>

<i>...it meant
something to you...</i>

<i>...you should know
that your love...</i>

<i>...will be with me until
my last breath.</i>

<i>If I ever made you feel...</i>

<i>...when you called me love.</i>

<i>If any time...</i>

Niurka on the stage!

What a beautiful woman!
Who is she?

Does she have a boyfriend?
Not, as far as l know...

...but l warn you,
she has two sons...

...and she is not
what she seems.

l don't care.
l'll bring her to Mexico...

...to make her a star.

Chief, here is Niurka.
Thank you, Chela.

Thank you, Chela.
lt's a pleasure to see you again.

Her character is Mirta in the
soap opera ''Vivo por Elena''.

We need to arrange some
documents to join...

...the actor's uni√≥n.
Smile.

She's a beautiful woman,
she dances...

Dance as you used to do
in Merida. Just a little bit.

Perfect, just like that.

We have to work on her image.
Don't be shy.

We have to buy her
some clothes...

Look how her eyes shine.
Smile, please.

What?
l feel embarrassed.

What about your documents?
l feel embarrassed.

Don't be embarrassed.
Where is your passport?

Smile.

Where is your passport?
Smile, girl, please.

l don't have a passport.
lf you're asked to smile...

...just do it.
l feel ashamed.

Don't be! You can't feel
embarrassed while acting...

...before cameras.
Smile. Smile.

Did she just eat?
That can be solved.

Yes, sir.
Send her to see my dentist.

That's not a problem.
Don't worry about the passport.

Thank you very much, Juan.

Juan, can we have dinner
tonight?

l'd like to but l can't.
l am with ''Profe''...

...setting it all
for the soap opera.

Chela!
Chela!

<i>- Chela!
I'm coming.</i>

Please hurry.

Take her to the motel.
Sure.

Thanks.
See you.

Welcome.

Her teeth.

You'd die for Niurka.

l know you,
l know you pretty well...

...with all respect...

...she is very beautiful...

...and very hot...

...with all respect.

l know that
l'm not handsome...

...or a sexy man...

...but what matters is money...

...and power solves
everything...

...and l have power.

That's why you are
a real Casanova.

You have your ex-wife...

Kena.
A beautiful...

...elegant and classy woman.
Yes.

And the pretty daughter she
gave you.

The great Sabrina and
Kena is a good mother.

What about Niurka?

''Flaco'', l have all the casting
bothering me...

...because l just support her
and send her...

...to the interviews
and magazine covers.

l don't care what they say,
''Flaco''. l will support her...

...although they don't like it.

<i>Cut!</i>

Congratulations.
lt was great.

Paquito!

l need a gown, costumes.
Did you like the scene?

l loved it. You dance
with such a strenght...

...and your clothes...
Let me see your smile.

l want to see it!

What a difference your
beautiful teeth make!

How did you like the songs?
They are so romantic.

Buy a flower to...
your girlfriend.

But...

...we are not boyfriends.

Do you want to be
his girlfriend?

Buy a flower, please.

And you'll be pretty
forever.

Don't you see? lf you say yes
he'll buy all my flowers.

Who told you that
l want a girlfriend...

...and l'll buy
all your flowers?

Don't you want
a pretty girlfriend?

Tell him l accept.

Why don't you tell me?

Why don't you buy
my flowers?

l will buy all your flowers.
Thanks for everything.

l'll pay you in a moment.

Do you want to be
my girlfriend?

Yes...

...l do.

l loved everything l saw.

What happens?
Aren't you coming in?

Thank you.

Thank you for this night.

But honey, come in...
Thank you very much...

...for accepting
being my girlfriend.

Tonight, your so beautiful...

You're a real queen and l...

...l am your fan.

Goodnight.

Let's have a toast, ''Flaquito''!

A toast? Why?
To whom?

To Niurka. Who else?
To Niurka, ''Flaquito''.

Niurka?
Of course!

To her beauty,
because l respected her...

...l didn't make love to her.
l didn't touch her.

Look ''Flaco'', having sex
with no reason...

...doesn't take you anywhere.
Anywhere.

There are more important
things in life.

Exactly.

Such as respecting
the woman you like so much.

Niurka...

Niurka is the
woman of my life...

...but she doesn't know yet.

Niurka...

She will be the mother
of my children.

What is this?
What is this dog doing here?

l am the one who feeds it.

Hi!

l'm happy you're here.

Welcome and happy birthday.

The crazy woman is here.
Shut up mother!

l cooked all day for you.
This is Cuban cuisine.

l cooked all kinds of
Cuban food.

Mum, calm down. Be quiet.
You calm down.

Stop talking like that!
Sure, you're right.

l worked all day long.
Are you happy?

Let's go. Bye, bye.
Niurka, you're so spoiled!

l'm so happy you decided
to spend your birthday with me.

...here, in my house.
l also want to thank you...

...everything you've done for me.
l haven't felt lonely...

...in any time.
l feel embarrassed.

Why?
Because you paid the hotel...

...and the movies but...

...you were guilty...

...after those kisses
and caresses you gave me.

Don't worry.

Let's have dinner.
l didn't cooked all day...

...for nothing.
All this is for you.

Come here.
All this is for you.

Come here.
She's crazy.

l'm leaving!
''Papo''!

''Papo'', you have to stay here.
This is your house.

Everything's ready for
you to stay.

You speak very loud.
l'm like your mother.

Why am l drunk?
Because you wanted to.

Give me that suitcase.
Please.

What's happening?
You can't go like this.

You can't!
What happens?

This is your home.
l want to go to a hotel.

You can't go.
This is your home.

Everything is ready. Niurka,
please.

l just want some peace.
She talks so much.

You are drunk,
you can't go now.

l just want some peace.
Go to bed...

<i>- ...everything's ready.
Bring him.</i>

Let's go.

Where am l?

What a hangover!

How drunk l was!

Tell me...

...were...

...you happy?

Were you happy?
Yes, l were.

Let me tell you that l've
never had this feelings...

...for anybody. Any of this.

Men are...

Don't say anything.

Men are insecure
and we are afraid of...

Be quiet. l better bring
you some juice.

l want to take care of you.

l'll be here in a minute.
Yes.

The juice.

The bathroom is there.
Yes.

l'll bring your juice.
l'll be right back.

You don't know how much...

Thank you.

How much l wanted to make
love to you.

You fascinates me,
l like you...

...you are a beautiful woman.

You took too long.
ln Mexico you leave me so wet.

Niurka, l don't want
to take anybody's place...

...but l want this
to last very long.

Take the ashtray.
Take the dishes too.

l want to spend the last
days of my life...

...with you.

My sons are
the most important l have...

...but after all
you made me feel...

...you won a place.

My relationships haven't
last longer because...

...l don't want to get married.

Who told you l wanted
to get married?

l don't want to get married.

Would you like to live
with me in Mexico City?

ls it a joke?

No.

l want...

Listen to me,
l want...

...l want...

...l want you to be my woman.

Chief...

...l've never seen you
so happy since l met you.

You are like another person.

Niurka is so pretty,
so beautiful.

When we made love
there was magic.

Magic! Magic!

You're in love.
l am!

l'm not the right person
to advise you but...

...l don't want you to get hurt.

l am happy, ''Profe''.
l am happy!

Look at me!

l will tell you last news;
Today my new family arrives.

This is the family
l always dreamt of.

Juan, you make me so happy.
How is your soap opera going?

lt's been approved. The name
will be ''Nunca te olvidare'''.

l will start it soon.
lt'll be great if l were...

...performing in it!
You will. But you...

...have to be prepared.
Sergio Jimenez will be...

...teaching you.
He's the best.

Bring me the best teacher.
lf you want me to study...

...l will study.
When can we start?

Calm down. Calm down.
You'll have a change of image...

...you hair, your clothing,
you will be beautiful...

...and l'll be the happiest
man in the worid.

When l am sitting in a box
seat, the backdrop opens...

...third call, thanks
and claps... and success.

You must be the best.

Wow!

''Ma'', you look...

''Pa''...

Do you like the character
l am playing...

...in the soap opera?

You want to know
what l think, don't you?

l like it.
But you can do it better.

Niurka, there's something
for you.

Good morning happy couple.

That shirt suits you
very well.

A credit card.
l can't believe it honey!

l've never been given one.

Niurka, l see you so happy...

...but l feel so sad when
l think...

...of your little brothers
in Cuba. That breaks my heart.

There's something else.

Here it is you checkbook.

Your checkbook.
The first check is for me.

Let's sign it.
l'm left handed.

Okay. Let's see.

Here it goes the date,
the numbers, and here it goes...

...the signature,
which is the most important.

''Pa''...
What's wrong honey?

l've never used one.
lt doesn't matter!

My left handed woman,
sign here.

<i>I should have faced
my reality and not tried...</i>

<i>...to avoid my responsibility.</i>

<i>Perhaps this was
the beginning...</i>

<i>...of my sentimental problems.</i>

Saul!

Mrs., l swear l don't know.

He's very private with his life.

l swear l will find him
no matter where he is.

lf l find him with a woman
l will take her hair off...

...and drag her around
the building.

Did you hear!
Don't be like that.

l'm also worried about
where he could be.

Look, Saul. lf he dies
it'll be your problem...

...and l won't rest until
l see you behind bars, bastard!

Yes, Madame...

l'll call the boss,
if he authorizes me...

...to take you where
he is, l will.

Do it! Call him!

Call him now!

Listen to me, this is
the last time l tell you...

...we left everything
in Merida and followed you...

...we are in this city alone.

What will we do if Juan
doesn't come back?

How will you pay this house?
With what money will we live?

Jesus!
Niurka, do something!

Juan still hangs out
with his friends...

...and spend everything
in his addiction!

l can't think of anything, mom!
Anything!

Then, let's move on.

You've known this beautiful
life everything goes well.

But there is more money...

...more luxury and comfort...

...and if he doesn't show up,
it doesn't matter...

...there are richer men
than Juan...

...and you can meet them.

No, mom.

l love Juan very much.

l love him.

''l love Juan very much.
l love him.''

No, Niurka!
No!

Think about it.

That bastard is destroying
the best years of your life.

The most valuable years.

Come here, honey.
Come here.

Look at you.

Look this body.
Look how pretty you are.

This is your time,
the time to find...

...a wealthy man.

Did you get it?

How stupid you are!

Will you tell me
where you were?

What do you want to know?

Are you still jealous?

How do you think...

...l would cheat on...

...a beautiful woman like you?

What happened?
Did you miss me?

A lot.

This little brace.

l like this little red
Riding-hood brace.

No.

You are being difficult,
aren't you?

Calm down.
Did you miss me?

l love you.

l got you.

You're mine. Mine.

''Ma''.

Do you want to sing?

What?

Do you want to sing?

l don't mind selling my house.

l have a lot of faith
to my wife!

You don't have
to sell your house.

l can produce
and sponsor her.

Thank you, ''maestro''.
You're welcome.

Thanks!

Will you be a singer?
l'm telling you...

...she's my daughter
and she will never sing!

She will sing!
She won't!

l know that because she's
my daughter. Do you understand?

l can't believe it!

Kiko, Romina,
you will fall down!

Niurka will do it well.
l never make mistakes.

l don't make mistakes either.
What's your problem?

Don't worry.
Don't get mad.

This CD...

...will be a success.

l'm very nervous.
Why?

Because l will start recording
l can't believe it.

With such a body
you can sing, dance...

...or do whatever you want.

Besides, l'm working on
your show. What do you think?

l think it's great.

Hey, hey!

You won't let her
sing with those kisses.

You're right.
But we are so happy.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Juan says l can be as sexy
as Marilyn Monroe...

...and wonderful dresses,
l can't imagine that.

All media and l posing like
in the photo that...

...made her famous, where
she was wearing her skirt.

You believed him, right?

What you have to do
is find a rich man...

...who deposits money
in your account...

...and leave that addict.

l'm going to be the
Mexican Marilyn Monroe.

God...

God...

l don't want to die.

l don't want to die.

l don't want to die.

You know how much
l've fought against this.

l can't stop drinking!

l love my woman.

l want to die!

l want to die!

God!

Help me!

l don't want to die!

l don't want to die!

l don't want you
to die, Juan.

''Ma''?

''Ma''?

Go away!

Go away!

Don't waste you life with me!

Go away! Leave me!

l'm...

...a piece of shit!

Go!

Go! Leave me!

l love you.

l love you.

''Ma''...

l'm sorry.
Forgive me.

Dear, don't ask me
to forgive you.

l love you very much.

Let's go home.

Juan, brother. Juan!

You can't helped, right?

l don't know what is
my daughter doing with you.

You're wasting her beauty!
You're wasting the best...

...years of her life!
Why don't you die?

Bastard!

Keep away from this.
She's my daughter!

Leave her live her life!

She doesn't have
a future with you.

There's nothing with you.
We'll end up in the street.

You spend everything
in that shit!

Mommy, please.

This is not the right time.
l beg you!

Please, mom.
l have to think about you.

l have to take care of you.
This ends here.

You have to fly but high.

l'm sick of your scolding!
l'm sick of you, Juan!

lt's not fair! You're
destroying my daughter's life!

lf you hate me that much...

...get out of our house!
l'll do with my daughter!

Get out!
Niurka!

Niurka, please!
Please, Niurka don't go with him.

Please, Niurka!
Don't go away!

<i>If I haven't let
my mother-in-law lived with us...</i>

<i>...perhaps my marriage
would have succeeded.</i>

l take care of your sons
and your home while...

...you wants to become
an actress and a singer.

Madam, calm down!

He defends you!

What have you done
to fool him?

Did you bewitched him?
l am a lady, mom!

l'm your mother! l know
the piece of shit you are!

Don't insult my wife!
l insult her if l want to!

She's my daughter and
l know her very well.

l know the kind of woman
l have, that's why...

...l have her with me.
l also know her well!

She's a brazen woman!

That's a lie!
lf you are a lady...

...why do you have sons
from different men?

Stop it! This is nonsense.
Listen what l'm telling you!

She will take everything
from you!

She will leave you
with nothing!

Juan!

Juan! Listen to me!
She will cheat on you.

Listen to me Juan!
Niurka!

Niurka, listen what
l have to say...

...she always says you are
a black and short ugly man!

Madam, Niurka is incapable
of saying such things...

You are a liar!
l'm not the liar, she is.

Tell her what you used
to do in Merida.

Tell him you are a whore!

That's what you are, whore!
Leave her alone.

You, son of a bitch!

Son of a bitch!
Now you're leaving!

Whore!

Bitch! Whore!

Bastard!

l can't believe
all the things she said.

My own mother, who carried
me for nine months.

We have the same blood.
l can't believe...

...she said such things
about me.

l can't believe she called
you whore.

She's always been like that.
When she sees me happy...

...she wants to destroy me!
lt's always been the same!

But she's so sure
when she speaks.

Are you going to believe her?

Stop the car!
Stop it or l'll jump!

Wait! Calm down!
Stop it!

There's a car coming.
Stop it! l don't want...

...to be here. Go to hell!

Niurka!

<i>My grandfather used to tell me:
''The way you see your...</i>

<i>...mother-in-law
your wife will be.</i>

l can't believe it! l can't.
l thought that...

...our relationship
would be better...

...when your mother
left to Cuba.

How is it going to be better
if you are always out?

l'm sure you're cheating
on me!

l'm not dating anyone.
Once again you are jealous!

More and more your are crazy.
You are like your mother!

l'm not like my mother!
Do you understand?

l'm not like her!
l'm not like my mother!

We went beyond the limits.

We are disrespectful!

This is going to hell!

lt's sad to tell you, Juan...

...but you broke your promise.

You did drugs again,
so you're out of the company.

No! Production is my life.

lt's the only thing
l can do.

l don't want to be out!
l don't think so.

You didn't keep your word.

We had an agreement.
There's nothing else to say.

You chose. You fired yourself.

Thank you.

l'm glad you're here.

l'll leave you a letter...

...but l better read it to you.

<i>After having had
the life I had...</i>

...l felt secure
and protected with you...

...l thought l'd win
the battle against drugs...

...but l realized l won't.

You made me feel
like a person.

l was a wife to you.

But you won't change.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Specially for treating me
as a person.

For taking care of me
and protecting me.

But let me tell you, Juan...

...this is over.

Don't go, ''Ma''.

Don't go today.

Just give me 24 hours.
Just that.

You can go tomorrow, ''Ma''.
But not today.

You will never change.

You'll do drugs.

That will be
your responsibility...

...not mine.

<i>God gave me serenity and
acceptance of my disease...</i>

<i>...and Oceanica my recovery.</i>

lt's horrible to feel
that the person you love...

...is going away.

lt's horrible to know
that you cannot have him...

...around your arms.

And l love him so much.

How can l save him?

l can't.

Thank you...

Thank you, because
l can believe...

...that he is with me.

l can see him smile...

...see him walk...

...and move on. That's
the only thing l want to see.

The only thing l care of.

l believe there's a God.

l believe he can make it...

...because you are great.

l'm happy...

...because l have him again.

Let's go home, ''Ma''.

Let's go home.

Guess what?
You tell me. l hate guessing.

l got another opportunity
in Televisa.

When will you start?
l don't know...

...l have several projects.
l'll see tomorrow.

Did you see what you got
for leaving drugs?

l know.

And guess what?
l will help other addicts.

l will give lectures about
addictions. l'll do my best...

...so that children don't
have this problem.

Do whatever you want.
l'll be with you.

Guess what?
You have your first play.

You will be starring!

The name will be:

''Una viuda sin sosten''.

''Pa''.
''Ma''.

What do you think?

What did l tell you?
Do you remember...

...what l told you
long time ago?

l told you l'd be sitting
on a box seat...

...you and the theater,
and claps, and success.

''Pa''...

...do you think
l'll do it well?

Sure! You've been
rehearsing for a month...

...and you do it fine.
Don't worry.

l'm not worry...

...l will win the audience.

Thank you for your support.

<i>First call.</i>

l'll get changed.
l don't want to be late.

Wait, wait, wait...

l help you.

l love you Juan,
with all my heart.

l love you too, Niurka.

''Ma''.

Yes, ''Pa''?

You fascinate me.

You drive me crazy.
l love you.

You know l'm very
proud of you.

Hi, Mimi.
How are you, Mrs.?

How are you?
Good.

Honey, l came to pick
my scripts.

l hope to perform from the
beginning of the soap opera.

As soon as your character
appears you'll perform.

lt will be decided tomorrow.

Why, honey? lf you are the
boss here. You can decide...

...about my performing since
the beginning of the soap opera.

Why are you in such a hurry?

Because...
Tell me why.

l don't want to be
in ''Aventurera'' anymore.

What do you say?
You didn't mention a word.

l didn't want
to preoccupied you.

The truth is l'm not happy
with Carmen.

Wait a second!

You can't leave
the theater season.

What about your image?

You are a professional,
remember that.

l'm going to help you but
you will finish the season.

l can't stand Carmen Salinas.
l'm fed up with it!

l hate working with her!
Niurka!

Enough!

What happens to you?
What happens to you?

Calm down. First of all,
don't shout...

...and don't criticize
your work mates. Calm down.

Take it easy.
What a character!

Okay, ''Pa''.

Promise you'll help
through all of this.

Of course that's why l'm here.
l'll protect you...

...and love you but you,
you will finish ''Aventurera''.

Give me those beautiful legs
which l will insure soon.

Here it is your tonic.

lt contains the most important
and the most delicious.

Be careful, it's hot.

Very good.

Did you like it?

''Pa'', more and more
your soups are better.

l'm a better cook.

Honey, if it wasn't for you
l wouldn't have...

...finished ''Aventurera''.

Today l hired Edith Gonzalez...

...to star ''Salome''.

l also told her that Niurka
will be Karicia.

Very good, boss.

Don't worry about Niurka,
she will be...

Congratulations
for our new soap opera.

l want to tell you something...

...but it makes me feel
embarrassed...

...l think ''Salome''
fits me like a glove.

You're great in ''Aventurera''
but theater and televisi√≥n...

...are two different things.
l was a cabaret girl...

...l know how difficult
the environment is.

That's why l was so tough.
You're tough.

Let me tell you something,
once l was about to tear off...

...a girl's ear at the cabaret.

She wanted to fight because...

...she thought l was
flirting with her husband.

Were you flirting with him?

Me? l have never had
to do that.

l've always had men
wanting to be with me.

Since l met you...

...l fell...

...in love with you.

Oh, ''Ma''!
Oh, ''Ma''!

''Pa''...

Do you trust me
to play ''Salome''?

You never give up, don't you?

<i>How difficult is to keep
feelings away...</i>

<i>...from professional life
and don't get...</i>

<i>...to pleased your mate.</i>

What does that blond girl
have that l don't?

A career. She's got a career.

Besides, Karicia's character
is very nice. You'll like it.

l don't like the idea.

You forgot. You forgot
that you was given...

...an opportunity at the office.

You filmed
a small sentence...

...and you were so happy.

Very happy!

You have to trust me!
Please!

l'm being stupid, right?
You're right.

There isn't any small
character for me...

...because l'm a very
good actress.

They look very good together,
don't they?

Boss, rivalry between them
is growing.

l know but Edith is
a professional.

She hasn't said a word...

...that's why we've
been able to work.

You and l were about to
break our friendship...

...at the beginning of the
soap opera because of...

...Niurka's comments.

Sit down there, boss...

...you're the chief!
lt's difficult to keep a balance.

Look, l'll tell you something...

...l will support my wife...

...but we won't take the star
the importance she has.

l hope this doesn't end my
friendship with Edith.

The suitcases are
very heavy.

l wouldn't change this moment
for anything in the worid.

Look at your face.
You are happy.

l'm very happy.
Can you imagine being able...

...to come back to Cuba
after long time?

Did you like the surprise?
Tell me.

l loved it. l loved it.
After all we went through...

...with my mom you
brought me to see her.

Of course. Family comes first.
She's your mother. Love her.

Thank you, ''Pa''.

l love you so much.

l love you too...for bringing
this heavy suitcases.

Look, my arms
are getting longer.

Your documents, sir.
Sure. How are you officer?

You come together?
Yes, we're together.

Your luggage.

He's checking my documents.

There's no problem.
Your luggage.

You want to check it again.
Your luggage!

Boy, don't check it again.

Of course, officer.

Here you are.

Calm down, honey.

l'm with you.
Anything will happen.

lt's so wonderful you came
to visit the family.

Mom, Juan insisted to come
and see you.

That's great, honey.
Everybody says you look great.

They are happy with
the soap opera and...

...you look pretty with
those dresses and dances...

What do you think about
your mother-in-law?

Mommy, l'm so happy. The only
problem l have is that blonde.

Even she's so educated and
she speaks English...

l can't stand that bitch.

My girl and her
beautiful expressions.

Netito and everybody love
both of you...

...you are such good people.
And besides you brought things.

l love all you gave me.

You know, we'll rent a van so
all we can head to the beach...

...you will get a tan.

How are you, Celeste?
How are you, man!

You can't imagine how many
times l dreamt of this moment...

...coming to Cuba and bringing
all those presents to my mom.

l will never forget this moment.

The bad thing is that we have
to come back because...

...we don't have much time.
Thank you for taking me here.

And thank you for giving me
a day off from my job.

l just wanted to see you happy.
lmagine, to see my family...

...makes me so happy. To go
to the places l loved...

...when l was a girl: ''La
Bodeguita'', ''El Morro''...

Can l tell you something?

Calm down, girl.
Calm down, baby.

Tom s, call my husband, please.

Why would you hire a girl
who came from a reality show...

...if there are so many
actresses?

Well...wait a second.

Hello.
Where are you?

Hi, ''Ma''.

l'm happy for all the
controversy about ''La Mapacha''

Tell them that it's
a strategy to get rating...

...because if l catch you
with another girl...

...l will drag her
around the building.

l'm with Alejandro Fagoaga,
he's interviewing me.

l'll put him on the phone.

Hi Niurka, how are you?

Yes, it's me Alejandro
Fagoaga. Perhaps you could...

...give us some minutes
for an interview.

Here it is your husband.
What's up honey?

l see you later, and have
lunch in our new house.

Kisses, honey.

Juan, she marks your time.
lt's love.

l don't know if it's just my
imaginations but...

...l want you to see what he's
doing with ''La Mapacha''.

Calm down.

Hector, stop it!

Don't move.

''Ma'', come.

Come here.

No, honey. lt's too cold.

Come here. lt's very nice.
Look!

See?

Come, anything will happen.

l'll take care of you.
Come my girl.

Come honey.

Come. Yes?

Give me a kiss.

Give me a kiss, honey.

Congratulations to both
of you.

Don't worry about Niurka, we'll
take care of her on Salome.

Our life will change radically.

Yes, honey.

Our lives have been
like a plane...

...a plane that flies
and flies...

...but this love
event makes us land.

Besides, you have friends who
care about you...

...and we will take care
of Niurka and the baby.

Yes, boss, count on us.

l got to go.

l have to work.
Of course.

This fountain
is in your honor.

This cage with birds...

...too.

Both will be here forever...

...whether we are
together or not.

Oh, baby...

That's why l thank God...

...for our child.

lt's a very loved child.
He's not born yet...

...and there are
lots of flowers.

Of course.
Of course.

She's a queen
and we will spoil her.

Careful.
Careful.

You're so beautiful.

The suitcase is too big
for you and the baby, Ms.

The suitcase belongs
to both of us.

l'm also getting interned.

We both will have the baby.

l love you so much.
l love you too.

We'll go to the OR in
5 minutes.

Honey, our baby is coming.

Our baby is coming.

When he's born take him with
you. He could be stolen.

No, no. Don't worry.

Everything is fine.

You're very brave.
Very brave.

Look, Juan.

lt's a boy, Juan.

Look.

Look, honey.

l have him here.

Look at him.

He's our son.

He's our son.

He's beautiful, honey.

Let me go.

ln the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

God bless you.

<i>''Ma'', I'm going to work.</i>

Where are you?

''Ma''?

''Ma''?

What happens honey?

What happens to you?

Are you okay?

Tell me.
What's wrong?

What happens?

l'm ugly, right?

l'm sad.

''Pa'', you don't love me
anymore, do you?

l love you, honey.
Of course l love you.

Honey, l adore you.

You are sad.

Listen...

You know, how important
it is for a woman...

...to have a baby.
A baby inside of them.

You know how many women
can't have babies.

There are thousands
around the worid.

But you can have them.

Look at me.

Do you know how many men like
me are so happy...

...because a woman like you
gave us a baby?

Life that gives life.

Honey...

...please understand...

...this is the last time
you are going to be pregnant.

Don't feel like that.
You are a queen.

l love you.

l love you.

lt's okay. lt's okay.

''Velo de Novia''
is a good title.

The only thing
we want to ask you...

...is not to have your wife
in the soap opera.

No! We can't stop her career!
Please!

lt's not possible to have
Niurka in every soap opera.

l hope l was clear.

Do your best. This body
must be beautiful.

l'm sure my husband will
give me a surprise.

You've always been
very pretty.

You've always been a star.
lt doesn't seem...

...you just had a baby.

l will go to the gym, you
know why...

...to star his next
soap opera.

Hi, ''ma''.
Hi, honey.

How is your soap opera doing?

You're smoking. l told you...

...not to smoke.
l'll see Emilio.

What a pretty woman.

See? l'm sure. l'm sure.

Your negotiation was very
skillful to make Niurka perform...

...in the soap opera.
Thank you, sir.

l want to ask you a favor.

Could you call her
and tell her the news?

She's going to be happier.
Okay.

lt's your responsibility.
Even she's your wife...

...she can't have more
privileges than others.

Juan, produce with your brain
not with your heart.

You know how to succeed.
Thank you.

Thank you.
You make me feel so well.

You're not only my boss,
you are a great friend.

Don't worry about
the soap opera...

...it's going to be
very successful!

Thank you St. Jude.

Thank you.

That l won't be starring
''Velo de Novia''?

l have anything
against Susana...

...but l deserve to star it.

Being the producer's wife
makes everything go slower.

lt's not fair!
l've worked very hard.

l'm getting older...

...and those characters are
given to stupid giris!

Honey, this is your
opportunity to grow...

...so people believe
in you and star. Understand?

The character is great.

Look, she's a taxi driver...

...from the countryside, brave...

...she's got a family...

...and, guess what?

She also has her
love story.

Just don't cheat on me.

Don't you trust me?

Of course l do.

lt's just the company's policy.

They don't want the actress
has problems with the producer.

lt's a company's policy, right!

Tell me who didn't want me
to star the soap opera?

Tell me and l will
convince them! Tell me!

Things aren't the way you think.

Understand?

So it's you.

You don't want
me to star it!

Listen to me.

l already explained
it to you.

lf you don't like it
don't do it.

Don't do it!

As simple as that.

''Pa'', promise it'll be
something important.

Okay, okay.

The character is a
brave taxi driver...

Can l be called ''Vida''?

<i>It's going to be very nice
with all the lighting and...</i>

...the rain.

And the 136...

''Pa'', look at me.

What's this?

You can't wear
long nails, Niurka.

Neither clothes like that!

That's not your character.
You'd be assaulted.

l agree. l thought you'd
authorized it.

Besides... it's not the
character's psychology.

Do you want me to dress
like a nun.

lf there's a problem with
my nails, l will take them off.

Bring me a pair of
scissors, please.

Your character is a taxi
driver, a taxi driver.

You come from a little town.
You'll change tires and...

...get your hands dirty,
you'll fix the car engine.

All your passengers are men!

You won't be dressing like that!

What's wrong with it?

l'm telling you it doesn't
goes with your character.

Sir, sir...

''Profe'', we will film...

...the scene the way
she's wearing...

...then we'll see where
we can change her appearance.

Yes, sir.
As you wish.

Hi, Emilio.

Forgive me for not seeing you
all day long.

Yes, dad is working.

l know that dad and mom
aren't very close...

...because of problems
and pressures...

...but we'll always have
time for you.

You're hungry, aren't you?

How heavy you are, my son.

My dear father-in-law, l wanted
you to be in Emilio's baptism.

l cooked spaghetti
the way you like.

Emilio needed you.

l know, my girl.

l have this damned disease.

Every time l feel like dying.
Give me a break.

Don't talk nonsense.
You're always saying that.

lt's true, woman.

l'm so happy to see...

...the beautiful family you
and Juan have started.

We as parents always ask God
for a good woman...

...to their sons
to take care of them...

...and support them forever.

Emilio, God bless you.

l hope you keep
your parent's love...

...when you're older.

And you Niurka, be a good
woman and a good mother...

...to your sons.

Don't let anybody disturb your
marriage or your family.

Well...

...l'm going to bed.
l'm very tired.

Son...

l love you daddy.
l love you too.

l love you too.

Come on, honey.

Juanito!

Hi, honey!

Welcome home, Juanito!

''Velo de Novia''.
What do you think?

l thought you were joking
when you asked me...

...to perform in your
new soap opera.

No way.
That's nice, Juanito.

l want Sergio Jimenez
be the director.

As you wish.
He's great.

Whatever you want.
You can do whatever...

...you want to the character.
You're great.

l just want to tell you, Juanito,
remember that ''Aventurera''...

...is my priority.
We'll go out of the city.

But you know about it.

You're always with us.

You know l love you very much.
And l love you too.

l don't forget you were one
of my son Pedrito's best friend.

Before passing away, he went
to say goodbye.

Remember?
Of course.

Excuse me.
Sure.

Hello.

ls something wrong?

What happened, Juanito?

ls something wrong?
Are feeling well?

Bad news, Juanito?

What's wrong?
What's wrong?

What happened?
Calm down.

We are here.
What happens?

My dad just passed away.

Calm down, Juanito.

Sit down.

My mom.

What are we going
to tell my mother?

You have to calm down.

Who will give the bad news
to your mother and sisters.

Calm down, son.
Take it easy.

l want to ask everybody
to go out.

l want to be with my siblings.

We will say goodbye
to my father.

Don't go out Niurka...

You know my father
loved you as a daughter.

Goodbye, dear father-in-law.

We will miss you a lot.

Your grandchildren
love you.

Go to heaven.

God bless you.

Like my mother says...

...life will be difficult
without my father...

...and he doesn't want
us to cry...

...because tears
are resentment...

...and pain...

...and we have to move on.

How does life is?

l don't know how life is.

lt took my father from me...

...and gave me a son.

<i>My father's death is an
emptiness I'll never fill...</i>

<i>...but life goes on.</i>

No, boss, no, no.

Niurka asked me
to give her more scripts...

...to Mr. Larios!
No!

He's not an actor
and never will!

He lacks of energy.

l have to be asking to bring
some food to him!

''Profe''...

The soap opera is going
very well. lt's improved a lot.

Now is the time to make
changes and an ending.

What changes?

What ending?
You're the writer...

...you are the soap opera's
genius.

Yes, Juan, l'm the writer.
But l don't want more changes.

That Niurka wants
this or that...

...that this guy, that is not actor
wants some more scripts...

...l'm tired of it.

l can't talk to Juan.

l told him to film Beto and
Vida in more sexual scenes...

...but he doesn't understand.
l can't believe it.

Shut up, please.
Don't talk to me like that.

l'll come back later.
Go away too!

Bobby is so lonely.

He has nobody listen to him...

...and he's so cute.

Yes, baby, he's very cute...

...you're giving him importance,
and they could realize.

And everything
would be spoiled.

You remember my birthday.

lt's also Emilio's...

...our son.

What a coincidence to
be born in the same day.

But we have to share presents.
Let me see.

Look...

...but you, ''Ma''...

...you are my queen.

My queen.

Listen, ''Ma''...

...l want to visit
Gloria in jail in Chihuahua.

After all that it's been said.

l would be close to that people.

And you shouldn't do it.
lt's not good for us.

''Ma'', it was very difficult
to get an appointment...

...besides l've been very close
to her since she left Brazil.

l'm sure she's innocent.

l want to offer her
a soap opera.

That could stain our reputation.
Understand, please.

l don't trust Gloria.

Because you don't know her.

Sergio Andrade's problem
is an enigma.

Nobody know the truth.

But let me tell you something...

...let me take you with me...

...you get to know her and if
you don't trust her...

...we forget the project
with her. What do you think?

Hi, ''Ma'', l'm home.

How are you?

l'm tired.

Guess what?
Don't say a word to anybody.

l have the ending
of the soap opera.

lt's great.
Great!

Picture this.

Everything
happens at the sea.

There's a violent persecution
there's a chopper...

...it shoots and Santamarina...

...rescues you
and become a hero.

What do you think?

Who had the idea that
Santamarina rescue me?

The writers and l.

The one who should
rescue me is Beto.

The one who should rescue you
is the starring character.

That's what characters
are for...

...to be heroes.

Your character
is important because...

...you will end marrying him.

You don't convince me!

The one who should rescue me
is Bobby, l mean, Beto.

Don't misunderstand
what l say.

l'm talking on behalf of
an actor who...

...doesn't have a person
to care about him.

lt's logical is...

...if he is the one rescuing
me because l love him.

l mean Vida loves him.

Bobby must rescue me.

l'm going to work.

l hope you change the script.

Honey, l'm glad you're here.

Wait, wait.

l'm watching the news.

You are watching the news,
and l'm here masturbating!

Calm down. Are you crazy?

Crazy? Crazy is your
fucking mother's ass!

How is it possible that a
man has a woman like me...

...and doesn't realize.
You prefer to watch the news...

...instead of fucking me.
How is that?

Because the only thing
you want is sex!

Sex, only sex.

What about making love?

What about caress
and romance?

Making love is a pleasure
not an obligation!

Not everything is just
to fornicate.

l'm sick of it!

Don't you like my teats?

Don't you like my ass?

All men want my body.

l'm sick of you!

You are sick of a man who
has loved you and...

...given you everything!

Who is a faithful man...

...and he's good father
to your sons!

Now that you're successful
you are sick of it!

Do you want to talk?
Let's talk!

Come on.

l'm fed up!

l'm fed up!

l think we should break up.

That's what you think.

l will fight for this marriage!

l'll fight for it!

You have to let him go to his
appointment in ''Aventurera''.

l'm sorry but Bobby didn't ask
for permissi√≥n he can't leave.

Don't be an idiot.

Everybody is rubbing
Juan's balls!

l warn you. lf you don't
do what l'm telling you...

...l will ask him
to fire you!

Honey...

That was too much.

Poor Bobby, this is
the first job he gets...

...and this assholes
wouldn't let him go out.

lf you talk to your husband?

You were right, Jorge.
Here we need discipline.

lf Bobby didn't ask for
permissi√≥n he can't go.

Even my wife...

She must ask for permissi√≥n!
Understand?

That's what l told
Niurka, sir...

...but she went
to talk to Martha.

Why she do that?

She knows what we have to do.

We're under pressure.
lt's the end of the soap opera.

Get the pending business.

Jorge!

lf you can help him do it.

Niurka, Niurka!

Hi.

Look what l have here.

Here it is the song, ''Ma''.

She is going to be the first one
to listen to it.

l don't want to travel.
l have a bad feeling.

l feel l shouldn't go.

How weird. You love
travelling with me.

l don't want to go.

l'm leaving on Sunday.
l hope you change your mind.

l'd love to go
with you.

l've asked you not to
smoke here.

l found an ashtray.

l'm going to hurry.

l don't want to miss
the plane.

How bad l'm feeling.
Hi, honey.

Do you have to
go to Chihuahua?

Or you aren't going.

l'd like to go with you.

...but l have to be here when
Romina leaves to Merida...

...and l can't be away.

What if l cancel the trip?

Are you crazy?
You have to see Gloria Trevi.

lmagine how lonely
she feels in jail.

You can't do that to Gloria.

You're right.
You're right.

l'm going to hurry. And
l'll give her the present.

Honey, tell her l'm very happy
for the song she gave me.

Of course.
Can l help you with something?

No, thank you.
Don't worry.

Why am l feeling so bad?

You know why, Juan.

Maria, can
l talk to my wife?

She's not here, sir.
She went out.

Do you know where she is?

She didn't tell me but
the moment you left...

...she took a shower,
get dressed...

...and she left too.

lt was around 9:30.

Do you want me to tell her
you're looking for her?

No, thank you.

Good afternoon.
Sorry for the interruption...

...you don't know me...

<i>...I'm Bobby's ex-wife.</i>

<i>You and I were betrayed...</i>

...but l'm being loosing my
reputation as a mother...

l know, l know, please
understand me.

<i>I feel desperate.</i>

<i>I haven't seen my son
for more than a year.</i>

l'd do anything for him.

l'd give my life.

Yes, l know.

l've receive some messages...

...that l wouldn't dare
to show you.

l'm ashamed.

Yes, sir.

Thank you very much, sir.

Thank you for listening.

Of course.
Of course yes.

Bye.

SHE DOESN'T NEED HlM WlTH
THE GOOD SUCKS SHE GlVES ME

AND l CAN RECOMMEND YOU
TO FUCK OUT OF HERE.

We have to talk!

What for?
Why should we hurt each other?

l haven't hurt you. l've
given you everything!

Don't play a martyr.
l'm not playing a martyr.

l just don't want to
be arguing with you.

We are civilized people.

Say something...

...l think this
relationship is over!

lt is time...

lt's time to recover all
we have been working for!

Your house,
your home and sons...

...when saving a marriage
sacrifices doesn't matter!

There must be sense!

You start.

l accept...

l accept our relationship
wasn't going well.

But there are two in a
relationship...

...the way we live,
work and pressures.

l want to try it again.
l want our marriage back.

lt won't work!

You left me alone.

You haven't thought
about me for a long time!

You haven't made me feel
like a woman!

l had to masturbate...

...to feel alive!
That's what you're looking for...

...an excuse to end up
our relationship!

You don't care.
You don't care.

This is very weird.
This is very weird.

Why didn't you say goodbye
to your son...

...when he went to Merida?
Tell me.

What were you doing
out of your house...

...all day long?
Tell me!

l already talked to her!
We aren't talking about that.

l want to leave this house.
l don't want to be here!

Besides, l want to forget you.
l really want to forget you.

l want time to find a house!
Niurka!

On Christmas you can be
with Emilio...

...because l'm going
to be with them.

l've already planned
my vacations.

Niurka!

This is over!

ls something wrong, boss?

There are many things wrong.

Boss...

l'm destroyed...

...lonely...

...l feel very bad.

All my worid...

All my worid fall apart.

l don't know if l'm going
to overcome this.

Juan, you can't fall apart.

There are lots of people who
depend on you and love you.

lf you fell we all fell.

lf you fell l'll do it
too, bastard!

What do you want me to do?

What do you want me to do
if suddenly l lost everything.

Everything!

...my wife...

...my sons.

The three of them were
like my sons!

l'm going crazy.

l think that...

...if my life depends on
another person to be plenty...

...my life is fucked.

There are lots of people
who want to see you down...

...don't let them.

You won't fell.

Look at my eyes.
Repeat: l won't fell.

l won't fell!
No, no! My father died!

My father died.

Who will hug me?
Who will advise me?

You don't know how difficult
it was to try to talk...

...to the woman l thought
was my wife!

What about the love?
Try to rescue our marriage!

And you know what...

...you know that
everything was fake.

Everything.

Do you want to be my father?

Say yes.

Look.

l'm your father.

My son...

You're the oldest. You
have to understand me.

This is the first Christmas
without your father...

...l can't resist it.

Don't worry.

l love you so much, mom.

My son...
l love you.

l...

...explain them.

Well...

...this night is going to
be sad since my dad isn't here.

We have to try.

He wouldn't like
to see us sad.

You're right.
l'll bring Emilio.

Okay.
Can you give me my suit?

<i>Juan, you're filming
the last chapters...</i>

...of ''Velo de novia''
in Veracruz.

Yes, you're right.
Here it is where it started...

...Veracruz has given us a lot.

Here it is going to end.

Of course, not
the way l wanted.

And the gossips about
your breaking up with Niurka...

...because she has
another man?

Honey, our room is ready.
