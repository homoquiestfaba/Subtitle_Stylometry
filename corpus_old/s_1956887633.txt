We were a big family and, uh,
we was too many children.

Uh, it was very
difficult to manage
all the families,

mm, for my father
and mother,

and, uh, you know,
they had to do--

they had to do
very hard work...

every day, you know,

and life was very difficult
at that moment.

We liked, uh--
W-W-W-We liked...

our mother better
than our father.

It, you know,
it's very difficult to say.

You know,
I'm sorry to say this...

because, uh,

when we compare
with our father,
and our father, you know--

Our mother, she was,
uh, very nice, uh, for us.

Yeah, he was very tough.

Always he beatin' us.

Then, sometimes
twice a day...
[ Chuckles ]

or three times
he beatin' us,
and, uh,

it was very, uh, hard.
[ Laughs ]

Yeah, this is the--
This is very, you know--

I remember it always,
this tree.

When we--
When I was young--

This tree is, uh, uh,
something special...

for me.

Always, I pray, uh--

That is very important.

You know, uh--

If, uh--

If the God not help you,

your work is, uh,
nothing.
