You have to learn
to fight for yourself.

I won't always be around.

Don't say that. Yes, you will.

I don't know
what I would do without you.

You're a strong woman,
you take after me.

I do?
Yes.

Whoa! Mom!

Yes, but this isn't always
the most effective weapon.

It runs out of bullets.

Where did you get a gun?
It doesn't matter.

All right, now, if a horde
of zombies comes at you,

you got to use
everything and anything

you can get your hands on
to throw at them

or bash their brains in.
Grab a saucepan like this,

hopefully there's
some hot grease in there

and just swing it at them,
just swing it

at their head, okay?

That's an option,

or you can use a knife,

okay?

But not a serrated one
because it will get stuck.

You can use this phone cord.

You can just grab it,
pull it tight,

wrap it
around the zombie's head,

pull and just... just choke him!

Choke him with the phone cord.
Okay.

Choke him. That's what you do,
that's what you do, honey.

Okay.
Okay. Hang on,

there's something else.
There's this.

Whoa!
Yes.

Just take this and just cut
their fucking heads off.

Just... Just... Just right over,
right through their neck,

right through their neck.

Doesn't that need electricity?
Oh, this one runs on gas.

That's why I keep
the gas can over there.

Oh!
Mm-hmm.

Okay. What about the bottle?
Oh, shit, that's for me.

It's for my nerves,
you know, it is the apocalypse.

Oh, okay.

Ah, that works.

Come here, listen,
repeat after me.

Okay? I am a strong woman.

I am a strong woman.

I am a strong woman.
I am a strong woman.

One more time.
I am a strong woman.

Yes! I am a strong woman.

Hey.

Oh.
Ah.

Andrea.
I'll be there in a second.

<i>Andrea, Thanksgiving meal.</i>

<i>You leave the stove on
all the time.</i>

I'm gonna miss the show.

<i>Hey, maybe I'm gonna bash
some zombies' brains...</i>

But, Timmy,
why are you eating my food?

Guys.
Hmm?

I want to watch the zombie
show with Doris and Marcus!

They always
get to watch it without me.

What do you think?
Not bad for canned food

for Thanksgiving dinner.

Thanksgiving lunch,

and why don't we go to the beach
like we always do as a family?

We can't.
It's not safe at the beach.

Ow!

I miss Dad.

Let's say a prayer, shall we?

Shall we?

Mm-hmm.

Dear Father in Heaven,
we thank you

for your blessings
and your graces.

We thank you
for our food, shelter,

and health,
and we especially thank you

for our family
during this apocalypse.

We thank you for...

No phones at the table, please.

Can you put
the volume up, please?

Mom, turn it down.

<i>Andrea, stay out of my closet.</i>

<i>Just 'cause the world's ending
doesn't mean I have to ask you "please."</i>

Damn it! One bar.

Look, I understand your need
to feel connected,

but I am right here
and there's nothing

more important
than spending time

with your family
during the Thanksgiving meal.

Thanksgiving lunch,
and Dad is dead.

Don't you dare talk
about your dad like that!

I will talk about my father
whenever I want!

Don't sass me, young lady!

You go to your room!
I <i>will</i> go to my room

because I want
to charge my phone!

And don't come out
until you've apologized!

I'm not gonna apologize!

And don't break everything
like you did last time.

<i>I'll break
whatever I want, bitch!</i>

Yes!
<i>- Ah!</i>

Ah!

Yes!

Yes, yeah.
Doris, you're in the way. I can't see the TV.

Doris?

Doris? Doris, are you okay?

Doris?

Frank? Frank?
Something's wrong, Frank.

Frank! Frank, something's
wrong with Doris! Frank!

<i>Andrea! Andrea!</i>

If you can hear me,
I'm going to miss you, Doris.

I'm gonna miss you.

Bye.

Can we pray?

Sure.

Lord, we miss Doris

and we ask that you send her
to watch over us tonight

and help us have good dreams.

Amen.
Amen.

Can you tuck me in?

Marcus, you're 23 years old.

I miss her.

You still got me. We're family.

We're all God's children.
Brothers and sisters.

Do zombies have families?

Hmm. Yes.

'Cause Jesus rose from the dead.

Yes, Jesus was a zombie.

He was?
Yes.

Frank, can you leave
the light on?

Sure.

Good night, Marcus.

Good night, Alfredo.

All right, guys. Fresh hot
eggs. Here you go, Timmy.

There we go.

Marcus, there's something
for you there.

Zombie brains.

Gunshot.

Timmy, Doris isn't here anymore,
Timmy. She's gone.

Shut up!

Guys!

Calm down.

Hurry up.
Your day program is waiting.

Go to the program.
When you come back,

you can watch another episode.

There's a big marathon
on tonight.

All right?
Okay.

All right.
All right, let me look at you.

That's what Mom would want.
All right, let me see you.

It's good. I like the tie
and green T-shirt.

Thanks, Frank.

All right, have a good day.

Andrea!

Andrea?

Andrea! Andrea!

Andrea!

Mom, are you okay?
Andrea!

Mom?

Mom! Mom! Mom!

I gotta charge my phone.

Did I hear you say you like
brains?

Yeah, I like brains.

'Cause I'm Captain Kill.
I got brains in a capsule form.

Oh, well, then,
give it to the specimen.

Oh, no!

Marcus!

I thought I lost you.

Marcus, Frank.

Hi, Nicole.

Nicole.

I see you're still doing
the zombie thing.

Yeah, I, uh, Captain Kill
made me take my medication, see?

Captain Kill?

Nice, Frank, that's really nice.

So, let's get started, okay?

It's been a long time
since my last visit, clearly.

We need to talk
about your behaviors.

We need to discuss your goals.

I want a chainsaw
like Captain Kill.

Okay, no,
you can't have a chainsaw.

Anything else?

I want to spend Thanksgiving
with my mama.

Wait, what?

I want to spend
Thanksgiving with my mama

to watch the last episode
of <i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i>

and have Thanksgiving lunch.

Do you even know
your mother's name?

It's Mama.

We'll see, Marcus, but the information
I have is probably out of date.

You may not be able to have
Thanksgiving dinner with her.

Thanksgiving lunch.

Okay, well, have a happy
Thanksgiving, Marcus,

and I will see you
in three months.

And, Frank, I'm sorry
about your mother.

I'll miss Doris.

Well, I can... I can get a job
at the laundromat with Kim

so I can make enough money
to earn a ticket to see my mama.

Whoa, man, to join my family
has an initiation fee

of 23 years hard labor.

Bills are free, though.

Kim, can I get a job
at the laundromat?

Is he serious?

Ah...

Thank you, Kim!
Thank you, Kim! Thank you, Kim!

Marcus. Sign out.
I'll see you for dinner.

Kim! Kim, what... what's it...
What's it like to have a family?

Do you sing songs together
at the dinner table?

No. Dude, I sleep away
at the "laundry mat"

in between classes.
I basically don't have a life.

Yeah, me neither.
What are you talking about?

Frank cooks and cleans for you.

You're free
to do whatever you want.

Did you get everything?
Yeah, I got everything.

Yeah, you certainly do.

So does your mom sing songs
for you before you go to bed?

Dude, what is it
with you and singing?

You know what? Yes, yes,
she does sing to me.

She sings to me,
"Why don't you work harder?

Ah! My back!"

All accompanied to the soothing
mechanical rhythm

of washer-dryers.

"- Ah! My back.
Ice! My back."

Is that... is that a Korean song?

I think I've heard it before.

Throw the laundry in.
Kim, is this your car?

Yep.

Can I... can I ride in it?
Yeah.

Can I ride in the front seat?
Yep. Let's go.

Okay.

Hey, Nicole.

He needs stability.

He has mental illness
and developmental disabilities.

Yeah, and I think
he's got grand delusions

and hallucinations
in there as well.

I mean, don't we all?
Yeah.

I'm gonna double check
his file and I'll be back.

Have a blessed day, Frank.

So this is
our "laundry mat." Um...

Oh, I have to let you know
that my dad's

something
a little old-fashioned, so...

Is he like a dinosaur?

Kind of, yeah,
pretty much in a sense.

You'll get it when you meet him,
really kind of...

Marcus?

Marcus, hey.

Marcus, hey, focus.

Come on, let's go. Come on, this way.
Wha... okay!

You want a job, right?
Yeah, I want a job.

Okay, then you need
to follow me. Come on.

Okay.
Back here. The office is over here.

I'll introduce you to my dad.

Yo, Dad,
um, I found you some help.

Are you serious?

Marcus, hey, give me the...
Hey, I'm Marcus. I'm your new worker.

Kim, what are you doing?

Hey, you're always telling me
that you need extra help

and he could clean
the dumpster area.

If he does a really good job,
I mean, eventually,

he could maybe take over for me.

Can you clean dumpsters?
Yes, I can clean dumpsters.

He can clean dumpsters,
there you go.

All right,
I'll leave you two at it.

Kim! Kim.
Marcus you be good. I'll see you at home, okay? Bye!

Bye, Kim.

Don't touch that.
Okay.

Follow me, please.
Okay.

All the garbage?

It's all the garbage.

Is it Bambi?

Candy?

Daisy? Is it Paris?

No, those are the names on
the <i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i> show.

I must know my mama's name.

I... I must know their names.

Wow! You did
a great job, Marcus.

Thank you.

I've got something for you.

Hold on a second.

Okay. All finished.

Wow, what is this?

This is your knapsack.
You can sit here

and hang out
and read zombie comics, all day.

This is my favorite one.

Marcus, why are you
in a group home?

'Cause I ain't got nobody.
That's bad English.

"I have no one"
or "I don't have anyone."

Say it.

I don't have anyone.

Better.

Can you count money?
Yes.

I mean, no.

It's too bad.
I might have had a job for you.

I... I... I can learn!

I can, I can learn how to count.
I can learn how to count.

Come back when you're ready.

Okay, I'm ready. Oh!

Now I'm ready.

No, you can't just drop
this information on him.

We are not dropping information
on him, we are doing our jobs.

But you have to prep him first.
Prep him or deprive him?

'Cause that's exactly
what you're doing.

No, I want him to know too.
Then tell him.

Hi. Hey, Nicole.

Hi, Marcus.

Uh, you, you look...
You look pretty, like a flower.

Marcus, your mother
is in Lompoc Prison.

Oh, I know where my mom is!
I know where my mom is!

I know where my mom is!
I know where my mom is!

Thanks.

No, no, you need
toothpaste, weirdo.

There you go.

All right.
Not too hard, not too hard.

Little circles, little circles.

There you go.

If you brush too hard,
you'll hurt yourself

and you end up having to be

on pills the rest
your life, like these.

Good morning, Miss Smith.

Marcus, where did you
get these drugs from?

I found them on the floor.

Don't lie to me, Marcus.
People don't leave bad drugs

like these
lying around on the floor.

I'm not lying.
I found them on the floor.

That's it. You're suspended.

Frank's waiting for you outside.

Hey, where's Kim at?

He's not here.

I said where's Kim at, yo?

Kim's not here.

Please leave.
This is for customers only.

What you gonna do
about it, dawg? Huh?

I said please leave.

Those security cameras
ain't shit.

No red light.

Hey, I know you. Come here.
You got me kicked out of school.

Come here. I'ma kick his butt.

Yeah, let me out.
I'm telling Luis, man.

Yeah, you go tell Luis,
dorsal fin.

You want to go to jail? You
can't go around hurting people.

But he was going
to kick your butt.

I know, but sometimes
you gotta forgive people,

even if they wanna hurt you.
Everybody?

Yeah, sometimes
even your family.

But I ain't got no family.

You want to join us
for dinner tonight?

Yes, sure, yeah.

All right.

Welcome to my house.
This is your house?

Yeah.
What?

Smells delicious!

Thanks.
I brought a guest.

Hi.

Marcus? What are you doing here.

I made a lot of money today.

You did. You worked hard.

Yeah, I worked my butt off.

Yeah.

I worked so many hours.

I love that comic book place,

that bed thing that you made.

Yeah, it was hard work.

You worked hard.

Yeah, I had to use
all my muscles.

You did. He was a great help.
I was really impressed.

It's all for you, best friend.

Thank you.
Yeah!

I made so much money today.

Jung, who's this?

This is Marcus.

He saved me
from the gang bangers.

Yeah, I'm the hero
this town deserves.

Dad, why didn't you
just hide in the office?

Why didn't you fix
the security cameras

like you promised?

Welcome
to the reality television show,

<i>The Koreans
of South Central L.A.,</i>

starring my family, the Parks.

Marcus, what are you
grateful for?

I don't have anything
to be grateful for.

You sound like my son.

Oh, I know
what to be grateful for.

I'm grateful for my mama.

She's at Lompoc Security Prison.

I want to have the most apocalyptic
Thanksgiving lunch with her.

But Frank
won't drive me down there.

Who's Frank?
Um...

You know you don't need
Frank to take you, right?

It's only $167
round trip to the prison.

Apparently too much
for my parents to afford to come

and visit me, but, hey,

you can have
dinner with your mom.

Kim!

Is this enough?

Oh! Oh.
Marcus. Marcus.

Yeah?
I made a chart for you.

Five of these pennies
make a nickel.

Yeah.

Two nickels make...
That's a dime.

That's a dime, right.

Two dimes
and a nickel make a quarter.

You know what a quarter is?
Yes, I know what a quarter is.

Right, so, four quarters
make a dollar.

And everything in the laundromat
costs a dollar.

So take this chart

and practice.
Okay, yeah.

And then you'll know
how to count money.

A dollar for every time
someone says thank you.

I call it
my mustard seed money tree.

This is our secret,
okay, Marcus?

Oh! My show's on.

I guess you could watch it on my computer.
Okay.

Just sit down right here.

All right, have a good show.
Wait. Don't go.

Watch it with me.

Hello?

Oh! Yes!

It's charging.

Frank lets you watch this?

Oh, they're just zombies,
and it helps me sleep at night.

<i>Hello? Anybody here?</i>

I am a strong woman.

I am a strong woman.

I am a strong woman!

I...
Quiet!

<i>- What?
They can hear you.</i>

<i>Who?</i>

Oh, that's nice.
Found a good friend.

<i>First rule
of the zombie apocalypse is,</i>

<i>don't let the enemy
know your whereabouts.</i>

What's with the bandana?
You look like a mini Rambo.

You don't want to get caught
doing a picture-perfect ninja move

and then blood gets in
your eyes. You get infected.

Come on, this is
a zombie apocalypse.

All my mom would do
is non-stop chatter

about the apocalypse as if it's the
most important thing in the world.

You just told me to be quiet.

Shh!
I'm signaling for my father.

Who told you?
What?

The bomb shelter. It was our
idea to raid the bomb shelter

while everybody was stuffing
their face for Thanksgiving dinner.

Thanksgiving lunch,

and I'm supposed to meet
my girlfriends here.

God, where are they?

I don't know who this bozo is,
but I hope he can kill zombies.

Family that slays together
stays together.

You okay?

I'm okay.

Good morning.

How you doing today, son?

Great, great.
Yeah, been drug free

for like five whole minutes,
staying strong.

You paid Marcus.

Did you raise the prices?

I had to pay him.

If I can teach him how to count,
maybe we can hire him full-time.

Besides, I'm good at teaching
people who have problems learning.

Oh, you mean me.

Really, you're going to compare
me to a guy who has special needs?

I cooked you breakfast
and studied for my calculus exam

at the same time.
Can he do that?

Hmm? No, no, I didn't think so.

Kim, one, parents, zero.
What up?

I think you're on drugs now.

Only uppers.

It's too early
for downers right now.

Enough!

Geez, Kimmy!

Mom, are you okay? Damn.

What did I tell you
about eating so much junk food?

Now you're just too big
to make it upstairs.

No mother deserves
to be spoken to like that.

Marcus, help me upstairs.

No, no, here, I was kidding.
I'll help you.

No! Turn around, Marcus.

Okay.

You okay? You ready? Okay.

Oh.
There we go. Let's go.

One at a time.

Don't drop me.
Okay.

Okay. You all right?

Yeah.

Okay.

You're gonna be okay?

Yeah, yeah.
All right.

Oh, man. What the hell
are you doing in my room?

What happened to you?

Do you mind?

Okay.

Look, um, when I was in prison,

I saw my mom.
She was nagging the whole time.

Nag, nag...

Yeah, yeah, in prison.
I thought I was going crazy.

I couldn't tell anybody

and they would have put me
in some straight jacket

and throw me in an asylum.

It wasn't actually until rehab
that I realized how much pain

I had caused my family.
And then, poof.

Just like that she was gone.

Look, this stays between you
and me, all right?

Okay.

Don't hug me.

Now get the hell out of my room.
Oh, okay.

Girl, you got a major hickey!

Are you kidding? They're
really zombies. I'm serious.

Whoo, they smell really bad.
Let me explain something to you.

They're zombies. Zombies bad.
Oh!

Go!
Oh, oh!

And then he was getting lava
poured all over him

and he was burning,
but then, the... the baker zombie

came out and he said,
"Get that boy out of there."

And then he grabbed him
and took him out of the lava

and then snapped his neck.

And then... and then season six
ended in a cliffhanger,

so I don't know
what happens next.

What is your obsession
with zombies?

They are disgusting

and that is why you have
violent behavioral episodes.

Thanks, Nicole.

He's gonna go nuts.
Then sell the business.

I can't sell the group home.
I grew up with some of them.

They're like my family.
We're here to serve

the clients,
not institutionalize them.

What kind of a relationship
do you think he can have?

You just want the money,
don't you?

Frank! Nicole! I need help.

I need to decide which zombie
my mom would want to see.

Should I show her this one or...

Or should I show
zombie Steve Jobs?

You're a mama, you should know.

I'll see you tomorrow, Marcus.

Nicole?

N-Nicole! You didn't give me
an answer.

I will see you tomorrow, Marcus.
I just wanted...

I like that one.
I like it too.

Thanks, Frank.

I gotta go.

Bye.

Can you work another night
to give your father a break?

Why can't you do it? You're
feeling better, aren't you?

My back!

Okay, fine,
if your back hurts so much,

why don't you go see
an acupuncturist or something?

I mean, it's like
you're pretending

your back hurts even more
to make me feel guilty.

Okay, then take me now.

No, I can't just take you n...

You can't just spring
something like this on me

out of nowhere.

I have plans.
Hey, I can take you.

And don't you have
to be somewhere?

Yeah, I got a hot set
of wheels out front.

Hot set of wheels?
Yeah. Hot set of wheels.

Yeah, it's nice, it's comfy,
it seats two people,

if you count the driver,

and it's really easy
to get around.

What's an, uh, an acu...
An acupuncturist.

Yeah, what's an acupuncturist?
A doctor for my back.

I overworked myself for Kim.

Well, Kim works so hard,
he doesn't even have time

to watch
<i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i> with me.

He abandoned
his responsibilities

while he was in prison
and left us alone.

Why do you yell at him so much?
Because I care.

Like, Kim's so nice.

Just take me
to the acupuncturist, okay?

So, tell me about the hospital.

Pretty nice or bad?

It was bad.
It was bad.

So at the hospital
people were given drugs, right?

Yeah.

What if the people
didn't want to take drugs?

They strap you down
and force them down your throat.

Morning, noon, and night.

One time, these twins
were given a lobotomy.

I could hear them
screaming all night long.

There was pus oozing
from the stitches

on their ears and their eyes.

They were wearing hockey masks.

Wait, what hospital
are you talking about?

Are you talking
about the hospital you were in?

Oh, no, that was...
That was the hospital

on <i>Apocalyptic Zombies.</i>

No, the hospital
I was at was nice. I liked it.

I never wanted to leave.

Do you even own a shotgun?

Too easy.

There's so many ways
you can kill them.

You could trip them

and, uh, smash their heads
into the floor.

You could, uh, behead them
with a ninja sword.

You could take their limbs
and shove them

into a trash compactor.
And then, and then,

you have the mother
of all weapons,

which is the chainsaw.
It's good for close range,

and you can...

All right, let's see
what we have here.

Not bad. How many ways
can you behead a zombie?

You can behead them.

That's one.
You can strangle them.

Strangle them.
I love zombies.

Me too! I love...

How do you kill zombies?
Oh, you electrocute them!

You can starve them to death,

but they don't really die
of starvation.

Their flesh just rots off.
Well, how many is that?

Oh, you put them
in the microwave.

You can take a broom
and you can take the...

...handle and...

Ah!
Choke them.

Choke them.
Bang their head in.

Bang their heads.
You can mess up

their credit rating.
That's fine, keep going.

That was a good broom!

Oh, you throw them in the water.

Sometimes it's not the zombies
you need to look out for.

He's not fun.

No, you can't forget
the chainsaw.

If there's an apocalypse,
you wouldn't have electricity.

Gasoline.

That makes 22.

You're getting it. You got it.

I got it! Yeah!

Oh, let me help you.
No, no, no, let me finish.

Mom?

Me Young, you're doing it!

She's doing it, Kim!

Okay.

Sorry.
Careful, I'm still sore.

I'm sorry.
How did this happen?

Marcus took me
to the acupuncturist.

Good job, Marcus.
You're welcome.

Hey, hey, um, uh, uh...

I'm sorry about what happened
in the laundromat earlier.

Jung said I can't go
around hurting people

and I hope I didn't hurt you.

You didn't hurt nobody, man.
I am Paco. I roll with Luis, yo.

Okay, so we're cool?

Yeah, we good, dawg.

Whoa! What's that?

My homeboy Luis.

Oh, that's cool.

Oh!

So what are you doing here, yo?

I'm trying to earn some money.

Wanna make some real money?

Right, follow me.

Oh!

Why didn't you kill them?

I saved you. You can go now.

Wait, wait, where are you going?

Why are you following me?

My mom was burned alive,
I can't find my friends,

and my phone is dead.

You may be a fashion risk,
but you're all I've got.

I'm Andrea, by the way.

What?

Uh, you should kill them.

Kill them?
Uh-huh.

Kill them.

When I stuck my hand
up her shirt,

I pulled her guts out...

This shop right here.

Tattoo.
Oh, Paco.

What's up, dawg?
What's up, yo?

It's good, man.

Who's this?
-Hey, it's cool, it's cool.

Hey, you're the guy
on Paco's tattoo.

That's right. See these tats?

They represent
blood brothers for life

and who's got your back
when everything goes down.

Do you guys sell drugs?

Do we sell drugs? This guy.

He goes to that special school.

Oh! We don't sell drugs.

Drugs bad.

Yo, he's retarded, not deaf.

No, no, you have
mental retardation,

you aren't retarded.
There's a difference.

See, Alfredo,
Alfredo is retarded.

Yo, he could be our muscle, man.

They ain't gonna put special
people like him in prison.

I took the test and I passed
'cause I'm too smart.

You were supposed
to fail, stupid.

So you don't go to juvie.

Huh.

Wanna make some easy coin?

I just want to earn
enough to see my mama.

See your mama?

Yeah.

Hmm. Tell you what,

why don't you join our family?

You can make
all the money you want,

see your mama all the time.

What do you say?

Go ahead, Marcus.
Welcome to the crib.

Yeah.

Hi, Luis.
-Come on down, man, have a seat.

Okay.
What's up, Paco?

All right?
How are you doing, Marcus?

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
sit down, sit down.

Okay.
Let's get comfortable.

<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

Check this out.

Like what you see, Marcus?
Do you work out?

There she is.
She does more than work out.

Hey, baby.
She's pretty.

Yes, she's pretty.

Why don't you turn around for
him, baby, show him what you got?

See that.

She's a ballerina!

Yeah, she's a ballerina!

Yeah, I'm a ballerina.
Sit down, baby!

Baby, I want you to get
to know Marcus over here.

Hi, I'm Marcus.
I'm 23 years old.

I'm sure nobody messes with you,
tells you what to do, right?

Right.

Do you know what
<i>"hermano"</i> means?

No.
It means brother.

You want to be
my brother, Marcus?

You want to protect
little old Sophia

from the bad guys?

Sure, I'll be your brother.

Maybe we can make
a little bit of money.

You want to make some money?

Okay.

Are you ready to be
part of the family?

Family is everything.

That's right.

<i>Mi hermano.</i>

It looks good on you.

You know?
You wanna go for a swim?

I don't have any swim trunks.

It's okay, I'm sure
the boys got something.

Right, Luis?

Okay.

Uh, Sophia has a jiggly butt.

Sophia has a jiggly butt.

Come on, come on.

Can you believe this guy?

Yo, check this out, yo.

Yeah, get him.
Hey, punk!

Where's my money at?
I don't got your money!

You hear this fool?

Your own people are stopping you
from seeing your mama.

They're not your family.

Get him!
This chump?

What?

Punk. Yeah.

That's right, boy.

It's all good. You got this,
man, you got this.

So get some new swag, yo.
You got this.

Let's go before the cops come.
Let's go.

The next time you stay out
this late, I'm calling the police.

<i>I've killed lots of zombies
before. Lots of them.</i>

Did you even hear
what I just said?

Go make me
something to eat, dawg.

<i>- When?
Uh, last summer.</i>

Have you been drinking?

<i>So, you've actually gone</i>

<i>all the way and killed them.</i>

<i>So, uh, why didn't you kill
them if they were zombies?</i>

<i>Because. You know,</i>

<i>I've killed lots of zombies
before. Lots of them.</i>

You just lost
your weekly allowance.

<i>Let's see a photo...</i>

You blew it.
Gang clothes, Frank?

He has the right
to wear whatever he wants.

Somebody else gave it to him.

Oh, Marcus,
Marcus they're really loud.

Shush!
And he's moving

to another facility.
What?!

You can't just do that!
No, Marcus.

They're yelling
and they're really mad!

Shush! Shush!
I have to go.

I can't afford to lose a client.

He needs more attention

and another psych evaluation.

There's nothing wrong with him.
He wants to be with his mother.

Bye, Marcus.

I want to be with my mother,
but she passed away.

There's nothing
psychologically wrong with me.

Shit.

Marcus, meds.

We're a family and we have
to take care of one another.

I have the right
to refuse medication.

And you also have the right
to be homeless

where you have no family.

Hey, show me.

Mama, I want to see you again,
but I don't...

I don't think you'll remember
what I look like.

I've changed a lot, Mommy,

and I hope
you can still remember me,

because I... I still love you
like I used to.

I'm... I'm trying
to raise enough money

so I can come see you.

But I'll be there.

We can... we can have
Thanksgiving lunch

and watch
<i>Apocalyptic Zombies</i> together.

Go make us a drink.
Okay.

Paco!
Marcus, check this out, man.

You ever seen one of these?
Yeah, it's a pistol.

I want you
to be protected like a man.

Whoa, yo, chill, chill, chill!
He's all right.

Oh, no, no, no,
that can't go in there.

Why not?
The colors with colors.

But if you put
the wrong piece of clothing

in the wrong place, it
could ruin the entire laundry.

Well, well, well,
look who's back.

Hey, Luis.

You think you can do me
a favor and hook some up?

Hook some up? You still owe me.

Kim. Kim, we gotta go
to the bus station.

I got enough money
to see my mama.

And where'd you
get the money, Marcus?

Oh, I got it from...
From Jung's office.

There's a big safe
with all kinds of money.

Marcus, shut up.
Oh, yeah?

Let me see it.
Okay.

With all this money,
you can stab them, cut them...

Let me see that.

Hey, that's my money!

Very good.

Uh. Ouch.

You know what?
Your debt's clear with me, Kim.

There you go.

Now get out of here.

Come on, Marcus.
No, no, no, no,

I want to talk to Marcus.
You go.

Get out, go.

Damn it.

What are you doing?
Oh, shit!

Um...

Look, Dad, I... I know
what this looks like,

but all I'm trying to do
is put the money

in the bank for you.
Are you on drugs?

You don't understand.
Luis knows where this money is.

I don't care who Luis is.
Just take your stuff and go.

You're not listening...
Leave us alone!

Life was better
when you were in prison.

Just go! Just go! Go!

This is a gun!

All you do is cock it back,

put this, and then bam!
You're dead.

Does that make sense?

Uh, this is yours, I want
to make sure that we're cool,

that, uh, you got
what you need and, uh,

we don't have a problem.

What up?

You think you're tough, huh?
You think you're tough?

I'm someone.
Nobody messes with me.

Nobody.

I'm sure nobody messes with you.
Tells you what to do.

I said don't you mess with me!
I got the gun!

You're late.
Hey, I know you.

You got Paco in a headlock.

<i>So what you gonna do?</i>

That's not the way
it went down at, uh...

<i>You know, killing your first one</i>

<i>will give you special powers,
yeah.</i>

What about this, man? Huh?

Who's... Who's retarded?

Marcus, what are you doing
with that gun?

Luis gave it to me.

He said that if I keep
this gun on me,

no one will mess with me.

Give me that gun.

You could get hurt, you could
hurt someone, you could go to jail!

No, it's not dangerous.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Don't point that gun at me.

I'm not gonna hurt you!
Give me that gun.

I'm... Uh, I'm sorry.

Uh. I didn't mean to scare you.

Can I have the gun back?

I'm giving this gun to Frank.

Luis said if I don't
give the gun back,

he might come after me.

Don't ever bring that gun
back in here again.

I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

Gangs have brought nothing
but misery in our family.

All right, come on,
let's pick out a tat.

Okay.

Scroll through there.
Uh, that one?

Relax.

All right.

Shh. It's all right.

Marcus, I want you
to do us a favor.

The Korean family,
they've been taking advantage

of us poor people for years.

Now they're going
to raise the prices.

Hey, you're all right,
all right.

Come on, calm down. It's okay.

I'm right here with you, buddy.

That's all right,
that's all right, come on.

Think about it like this:
when the apocalypse comes,

do you think it's fair
that that family's gonna hold

their supplies
and not share 'em with you?

Come on.

<i>AdiÃ³s,</i> dawg.

Have you seen this man?
He's one of our clients.

Marcus!

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

Here. Hi, it's Me Young.

Come on, let me get you inside.

Come on.

Breakfast is served.
Marcus?

Yo, man,
you're wearing my apron.

And where is...
Mom and Dad?

What did you say? Mom and Dad?

They went for a walk.

Mmm, what smells
so good in here?

It's all right.
How'd you sleep, Marcus?

Whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on.
You were letting him move in?

He was sleeping on the porch.
I don't care.

He's... He's taking over my life.
You jealous of Marcus?

What?

Are you jealous of a kid
with special needs?

You mean a retard!

Kim, get back in here!

Come on, Marcus,
I'll take you to the laundromat.

Okay.

<i>Sure.</i>

<i>You'd be dead
if it weren't for me.</i>

<i>You'd be dead.</i>

Yeah, I don't like
that guy, anyway.

Ooh, there goes his left arm.

Oh, I didn't like him.

It's crazy.
It's like spreading all over.

Hey, did you see I fixed
the security camera?

Yo, Dad.
That's... that's... that's good.

Andrea's gonna die.
Oh, no!

<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

They're gonna do
a zombie hat dance.

Really? Really, you two?
It's just a TV show.

You know what? Forget it.

Yeah, yeah, you two go ahead,
hang out here,

best friends, and I'm gonna
go back to work and...

All the zombies
are circling her.

Uh-oh!

Same damn thing.

Marcus, I was worried about you.

Hey, calm down!

You're keeping me away
from my family.

Hey, if we leave now,
there's still time

to catch <i>Apocalyptic Zombies.</i>
No!

Marcus, we're a zombie family.

We gotta stay together.
Zombies don't have families!

Frank, can I see you
outside, please?

You know Marcus is safe
with us, right? He's like family.

You can't take him home
with you. He's not like a pet.

Of course he's not a pet. Why
didn't you just lock him up, then?

You can't lock him up, it's against
their God-given right to be free.

That's why they're not
in an institution.

He's a child's tantrum
inside a giant's body.

What are you talking about?

Marcus.
What?!

I've never seen him like that before.
He's got to be off his meds.

Is he dangerous?
Yes, that's why I came

down here to tell you
you're not safe.

Where did everybody go?

They left me.

Oh, I'm sure
they're around somewhere.

Here's to Thanksgiving Day lunch.
Wow!

What?

Uh...
What are you looking at?

Uh...

Dad! You're alive.
Dad?

This is my dad.
No, that's a zombie.

He's not a zombie,
he's just drunk.

He does this all the time,
stumbles around...

Oh, God, Andrea, run.
He's a zombie!

Marcus, what happened?

Do you know
why I am in a group home?

Why?

She said he took one look at me

and left.

Marcus.
I took a hose...

pushed her against the wall,

and beat her with it.
Marcus.

What...

Marcus, Marcus...
The cops...

They took her away from me.
She never came to see me.

It's okay, Marcus.
No one wants me!

Marc... Marcus!

Nicole just called.

She'll be here in the morning.

Thanks, buddy.

Oh!

You shouldn't be here.

I'm sorry, I need one more...
I need to work one more day.

I'm... I'm gonna get kicked
out of my group home.

Marcus, you threw me
down on the ground.

You hurt me.

I'm sorry.

But you told me
I need to forgive everybody.

Yeah, I guess I did say that.

All right, let's go do
the money chart one more time,

see what you remember.

Four quarters make?

There he is.

Marcus, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

Yo!

No.

Where's the safe at, Marcus?
I don't know.

Where is it at?
I don't know!

Where is it at?!
I don't know!

Oh, you think I'm playing? Huh?

Do you think I'm playing?

Tell me now or I'll kill him.
Okay, I'll tell you.

You ain't gonna tell me,
you'll show me.

Okay, okay.

It's... it's here.

Don't hurt me.

Oh, please!
-Come on, man, there's the safe.

Paco, watch the door.

Come on. Let's go.

Come on, man, open the safe.
Okay, okay! Oh.

What's the matter?

I'm trying. Give me a second,
give me a second.

You think this is a game? You'd better try harder.
No!

I'm not playing with you,
Marcus. Open the safe.

I'll put a bullet
right through your head.

Open it! Get down.
Okay, okay. Okay.

Open the safe.
You got five seconds.

Um... Uh, uh...

82nd episode,

um...

33 survivors.
Three...

Two...
It's 47 zombies.

One...

I'll shoot you, Marcus.
Oh, no, okay, it's open.

Yes!

Come on, you did good.
Okay.

Look at this!

Get your money on that,
come on, that's your money too!

Come on, come on, come on.
Go. Let's go.

We gotta go. We gotta go.
Come on, come on.

Dad? Dad, Dad, Dad?

No, no, no, no, no! Dad, Dad,
Dad. What happened? Dad?

Dad, wake up! Dad.

Hold on, Dad. Just hold on!

Whoo!

Hi!
Mom! Mom!

<i>Yeah?</i>
Something's happened to Dad

<i>at the laundromat.
I don't know what's going on!</i>

<i>- He won't wake up.</i>
What?

There's blood and I...
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>

I called an ambulance.
Just get over here, please.

Okay, okay,
I'll be right there. Bye.

<i>Appa!</i>

Marcus...

Please, Dad!

Hey!

Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, come here! Come here!

Are you disrespecting me?
Why are you fucking pushing me like that?

Why are you dancing on him?
That's what you want me to do, right?

Huh?
Quit playing with me. Huh?

What I want you to do:

I don't want you
disrespecting me no more.

Get the fuck off me.
That's disrespecting me.

Looks like Marcus cares
about me more than you.

Oh, you like that?
Makes you mad, doesn't it?

Get off me, fucker.

Sophia!

Fuck her, man.
Yo, get this money, man.

Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

Take the money.

Take the money.

Take it, take it, go!

Go, go, go!

I...
Marcus!

The hell
are you doing here, man?

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
You're sorry?

Yes. Yes.
You're sorry?

I just wanted to apologize.

Apologize?
Yeah, yeah.

Do you know what you did?

No, I mean, I just, I'm sorry.

Do you have any idea
what you've done?

Yes. I didn't... I didn't mean
for all of it to happen.

Marcus, shut up.
I'm sorry.

Just get out of here, man.

Okay.

Shit.

Hey, Marcus.

Hey, get in the car.

I think you should see
your mother.

We'll have
the apocalyptic Thanksgiving

I always wanted.

Who the hell is that?

What do you want?

I'm... I'm your son Marcus.

Oh, my God. Marcus?

Yeah.

Oh, honey.

Mama, why did you put me
in a group home?

I n... I... I really never meant
to do that, Marcus.

I never meant to do that.

I... I... I love you, Mama.

I love you too, sugar pie.

Oh, I love you so much.

Boy, look at you
after all this time.

Goddamn, I got me a big, fine,
handsome son. Look at you, Marcus!

Wow!

Happy Thanksgiving, Mama.

Oh, happy Thanksgiving, pumpkin.

Did you bring me anything?

Yeah, yeah, I got you...
I got a... Look, I...

It's an action figure
from the 23rd episode

of <i>Apocalyptic Zombies,</i>

when they have
to escape through the...

Zombie what, Marcus?

That's what you brought me?

That's what you brought me,
Marcus, huh?

Marcus, you still retarded!

Let me tell you something.

You want to know why

I couldn't take care
of you, Marcus?

Do you want to know why I
put you in that home, Marcus?

We could have been together.
We could have made it,

you know, we could have made it.

But you, you used to kick,
bite, and fight me all the time,

Marcus, all of the time.
I'm sorry.

Do you remember
the day at the car wash?

When you hit me
with that hose, Marcus.

Do you remember
that day at the car wash?

Yes!
The cops took me to jail for dealing!

They drove me to jail, Marcus,

'cause of your dumb ass.
I'm sorry.

Oh, baby we could have made it,
though. I had the perfect thing.

Used-up, old druggie
and her retarded son

seek redemption. Amen.

Oh, yeah, that would have been
the best hustle.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Look at you. What do you want?

Time!

Wait a minute.

You know what?

God didn't give me
no star athlete

or no computer genius.

He gave me a monster.
You're a monster.

Look, I said time.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

Stop! You see how they treat me up in here?!
Wait! Hey!

You see what they do to me?
Wait!

It's because of you!
Hey, get off my mama!

Mama never stopped
thinking about you.

Hey, get off of her!

No, Mama! No, Mama, no!

Sorry.

I'm sorry!

Happy Thanksgiving, Marcus.

Got Salisbury steak
and mashed potatoes.

Here barbecue ribs
and mac and cheese.

Salisbury steak, mac and cheese.

I know you like mac and cheese.

All right,
I'll put it over here.

I'm sorry about your mother.

She doesn't realize
how special you are.

I gotta get this.

Marcus.

Who is it?

Hi!

Hi! Nicole said
that somebody was moving out.

Oh, wow.

This place is more beautiful
than the pictures.

Doug!

Oh, you must be Frank.
Yes.

Nicole was wrong...
I'll take it.

No, Nicole was wrong.
There's no room available.

Look, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I didn't know

that you wanted to stay here.
I thought you were moving out.

I haven't signed
the papers, Doug.

Zombies are so yesterday.

Marcus!

No, Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!

Did you fix
the security cameras?

Dad, just watch the video, please.
-<i>Paco, watch the door.</i>

<i>All right. Come on! Come on.
No, no, no, no, no.</i>

<i>Okay, okay, no!
No, no, no!</i>

<i>- Open it!
Okay.</i>

<i>It's the 82nd episode,</i>

<i>um, 33 zombies,</i>

<i>- 47 survivors...
I'ma shoot you, Marcus.</i>

<i>No! No, okay,
it's open! It's open!</i>

<i>Come on, come on, come on.
You did good. Hold that.</i>

<i>- Hold that! Hold that!
Okay.</i>

Okay, enough.
<i>- Good job, Marcus. Get that money.</i>

I knew he was not to be trusted.
He stole our life savings.

No. No, Mom, Dad.
No, Dad, Dad, he...

He saved your life. I...

Those guys wouldn't have been
there if it wasn't for me.

I... I take full responsibility
for my...

I accept full responsibility...

...f... for my actions.

I'm not asking either one of you
to forgive me, okay?

I just... Please forgive Marcus.

Don't... Don't press charges.

When they put me
on the electric chair...

...and I resurrect
as a zombie...

...will you be the one
to take me out?

With a chainsaw.

We have to forgive.

Help me.

Happy Thanksgiving.
Welcome back.

I'm happy to be back, Mrs. Smith.
Hmm.

And I'm sorry about your plant.
That was rude of me.

Well, that's okay.

Well, Marcus,
Frank told me everything,

including how you helped
the police arrest a gang.

Yeah, I took those suckers down.

<i>Happy Thanksgiving.
Gobble, gobble.</i>

<i>Gobble, gobble, Marcus.</i>

Now, you two are sure
you're gonna be okay

with me gone, yeah?
We'll be fine.

Well...
Good luck.

Thank you.

Frank, who's at the door?

Who's at the door?
Who is that?

Oh, you're here?
Yes.

So is my wife.
Happy Thanksgiving!

I'll get that.

Doris' Group Home,
Marcus speaking.

Hi, sweetheart.
Oh, hi, Mama.

How was your Thanksgiving?

Me and Frank, we ate
turkey all day, yeah.

He said I can eat all I want
'cause zombies eat all day, so.

Oh, that's nice,
that's nice, sweetheart.

Look when you come at Christmas...
All day.

<i>...can you bring me
some money?</i>

<i>All you have to do is put it
in my prison account, okay?</i>

Yeah, okay.
No, I have to go now.

Can you do that
for your poor mama?

<i>Bring me some money, please?</i>

Yeah, my show's on.

<i>Please bring me some money.</i>

No, my show's on.
<i>- Please, Marcus.</i>

My show's on!

Okay, bye.
Marcus! Marcus, Mama loves you!

Damn it, shit!

Hi, Marcus.

Marcus, what's wrong?

Marcus, you're a trickster.

Ah, get some popcorn.

Sharon's alive! Sharon's alive!
Oh, my gosh!

We thought she was dead. We thought
she was gonna be a zomb, but she's not!

Mom?
Andrea?

Andrea!

Aw, they're together.

They're reunited again.
They're like a family, Frank.

They're like us
'cause we're a happy family.

That's right,
just like we're a family.

Happy Thanksgiving, Mom.

Happy Thanksgiving, darling.

Your dad would have really liked
to have been here with us today.

The end of the show.

Yeah!
Yeah! The show! It's my show!

Can we watch it again?
Rewind it! Rewind it!

Good episode! Yeah!

I'm a zombie. Ah!
