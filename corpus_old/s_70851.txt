Look over my right shoulder.

Good.

Look over my leFT shoulder.

Very good.

You know. Mr. Gromberg...

you're not going
to want to hear this...

but for a man of your age...

less than a year aFTer a stroke.
You are in remarkable shape.

Well. My damn ticker.

Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom...
a mile a minute.

Well. Your cardiogram
showed no abnormalities.

Blood pressure... high?

Your blood pressure?
Better than mine.

How about my liver?

Your liver's
holding up perfectly.

Kidneys?
Fine.

What about this?
What?

What. This?

That's dry skin. Mr. Gromberg.
It's not cancer.

Say. "Ah."
Ah.

So. Are you still seeing
your speech therapist?

No. She talks worse than I do.

Well. I hate to tell you this.
Mr. Gromberg...

but it looks like you still
have a few good years leFT.

"A few good years."

How do you know?
Do you talk to the man upstairs?

Hey. Gromberg.
What's that supposed to be?

A sensei.
A what?

A sensei. A karate sensei.

Yeah? Has your karate guy ever
seen a pair of these before?

Morning. Everyone. I'd like you
to join me in welcoming back...

your classmate Abigail Staley.

Most of you have known her
since kindergarten.

Is there something you'd care
to share with us. Gentlemen?

So. No matter
what you've heard...

over the last
couple of months...

I know that you will be
kind and considerate.

Isn't that right. Mr. Cooper?

Abby.

What the hell
are you looking at?

What the hell
are you looking at?

Gromberg. I am going to have...

the red-lined
martine agreement...

in time for the meeting.
Aren't I?

I am working on it
as we speak. Barney.

Just checking.
Sure thing.

Asshole.

Alex?
Yeah.

I have your wife on line two.

What time are the martine
people getting here?

Any minute.
Shit.

Yeah. Hiya. Bec.

Hi. I have five minutes
between patients.

I just needed
a moment of sanity.

So you're calling me?

Am I on speaker phone?

I'm sorry. Honey. I'm up to
my ass with this martine thing.

Oh. OK. Don't forget
your parents are coming at 6:30.

Don't you dare be late.

And they're bringing
Uncle Stephen.

Oh. My God.
Better get out the body bags.

I'll pick up some matzo
on my way home...

aFTer the soup kitchen.

OK. Bye.
Bye. love.

Got a minute?

Oh. Deb. Deb. Deb. Please.

This is Rosario.
She's the sister-in-law...

to maria Elena.
Who cleans my house.

It's very nice to meet you.
Rosario.

Lf you'll excuse me...
Rosario has a problem.

She lives with her four sons...

her sister. Her sister's
husband. And their three kids.

And they haven't had
hot water for three months.

And they just made it through
the winter without heat.

Almost made it through.

Her father just passed away
from pneumonia.

Sorry.
I'm sorry about your dad...

but I don't know
what you want me to do.

I haven't done public advocacy
stuff in years.

Well. It's what
you should be doing.

All right. Rosario. OK.

I'll take a look at this.
I'll see what I can do. OK?

Gracias. Senor. Muchas gracias.

No problema.

Is someone coming to pick you
up later. Mrs. Gromberg?

Yes. My grandson.

Oh. Well. You let us know
if you need a taxi. OK?

You shouldn't be walking.

I have two grandsons.

Eli's the youngest. He's eleven.
He's Pappy's favorite.

And Asher's the one
who's picking me up.

I didn't want him to bother.
But my son insisted.

Asher's very laid out.

Laid back.

Oh. Back.

Right. Laid back.

Are you among the living today.
Mr. Gromberg?

Yeah. I'm here. Man. Ask away.
What do you want to know?

I asked you
if you had any thoughts...

on the progress
of mr. Stein's one-act play...

"Three Kikes and a Heeb."

Yeah. I mean.
To tell you the truth. Sir...

I was completely blown away
by this piece of material here.

I mean. Stein. Man.
That part where you have...

you know. The antagonist
antagonizing the protagonist?

I mean. That was...
What is he talking about?

That was rock-solid. Man.
This is ridiculous.

How many pages of mr. Stein's
hard work did you actually read?

That's a good question.

I believe it was
all but the last nineteen. Sir.

Out of twenty?
Mr. Edwards.

Not bad. Yes. Ms. Maloney.

I am amazed at you people.

Did no one but I find
the sickening display...

of anti-Semitism dripping from
every page incredibly offensive?

I did. I certainly did.
Would you... thank you.

I am sorry. But when
you have a Jewish character...

playing charades.
And you devote ten pages...

to his feeble attempt at acting
out the word "Holocaust"...

and make no condemnation
of the Nazis...

I'm sorry?

I mean. Do you have
no sense of decency?

Have you no sense of humor?
Humor?

How can I be anti-Semitic?
I was bar mitzvahed.

Oh. I'm sorry about that. Guys.

It's my grandma.
I gotta pick her up.

Could you possibly be
any more unappealing?

You are like a zoo monkey
smeared in his own feces.

Someone should follow you
around with a pooper scooper.

Pooper scooper. Huh?

OK. Mr. Gromberg. Show a little
class on your way out. Please.

Yes. Sir.

Watch out. Man.
Yo. Dude!

OK. My beautiful ladies...

today. We are running
a little bit of a special.

Two bags for ninety.

Nicky said he got two
for one twenty.

Well. For Nicky.
Two bags are one twenty.

But for Katie and Erica.
Two bags are ninety.

Do you take checks?

Cash only. Sweetie.

I don't have any cash.

Oh. Shit.
I gotta get outta here.

But I have to go to an ATm.

Don't worry about it.
I'll get you guys next time.

You see. Dr. Gromberg...

in the window
was this display of socks.

Beautiful. Fun socks.

Every color imaginable.

Cashmere.

Next thing I know...

the saleswoman is wrapping up
ten pairs for me.

Forty bucks a pair.

That's a lot of money for socks.

Does Noah
buy you special giFTs?

I can't remember
the last time...

he came home
with anything for me.

Son of a bitch.
Sir?

No. No. Not you.

My ex-partner... Kipling.

He died.

At last!

We're here. Sir.

Stephen.
Your brother is here.

Ahoy. Captain.
Are you ready to go?

Where are we going?

Pesach. We're going to a Seder.

Passover?
Yes.

Not yet. Not yet.

Gefilte fish?

Mama makes good gefilte fish.

Gefilte fish. Yes...

but not mama's.

Zabar's.

My daughter-in-law can't cook.

Ew! Ew! What are they doing?
That's gross.

You don't know what that is?
That's sixty-nine.

Sixty-nine's all right.
But it's nothing like oral sex.

Get away! Get off. Shea!

Anybody wet their pampers
today?

No. You?

Hey. You. You're in little
Abby Staley's class. Right?

Well. You tell little Abby...

that she never finished
what she started.

Tell her I've waited too long.
And my balls are gonna burst.

Whoa! Miss Congeniality!

Jesus. Gromberg.
Are you following me?

Following you?
Why would I be following you?

You just called me a zoo monkey
smeared in my own feces...

which I actually thought
was kind of funny.

But. No. I'm actually
just on my way uptown...

to go pick up my grandmother.

Your grandmother? Oh. Please.
That is such bullshit.

No. I am. I am. Sometimes
I pick her up from dialysis.

Oh. You are so following me.
And I wish you would stop it.

You know what. Peg?
You excite me.

You are so moronic it is unreal.

Oh. Screw me.

I don't think so.
No. No. I gotta go.

But before I do.
Let me get your digits.

Excuse me?

Your phone number.
I wanna give you a buzz.

You don't get the message.
Do you?

What do I have to do.
Barf on your Nikes?

Just give me your number...

and I'll quit hasslin' you.
All right?

It's on the class roster.
Oh. Yeah?

Under "unavailable."

At least give me some skin.

Later.

Excuse me.
Is mrs. Gromberg here?

You just missed her. I put her
in a taxi ten minutes ago.

Damn! Was she OK at least?

Listen. She's old.
It takes a lot out of her.

If you can't be here on time...

get somebody else
who can pick her up.

What kind of shit-ass portion
is this? Now serve it up!

Everything OK here. Suzie?

I explained to him
that we don't give seconds...

until everyone's had a turn.

She ain't gave me
but a few carrots.

A man needs his vitamin E.

It's vitamin A. But you're
right. It keeps the eyes sharp.

But we can't serve seconds till
everybody gets their firsts.

But I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do...

why don't you sit down
and enjoy your meal?

And I'm gonna make a plate here.

And if you're still hungry.
You come on back here...

and this plate will be
sittin' waitin' for you...

right... right here.

Aren't you
the little peacemaker today?

They should give you an award.
They already have...

most dishes washed.
Lake Kiamasha. 1966.

Yeah. But not
for how many you do.

It's for how damn good you look
when you do them.

Wait. Wait a minute.
What?

Oh. Don't tell me
you haven't felt it.

Felt what?

The heat between us
for weeks now.

Suzie...
All the steam...

the chafing dishes.

Suzie. Suzie.
What?

Oh. I'm so wet.

Come on.
You know I'm married. Suzie.

Yeah. I do. And so am I.

You are such a troublemaker.

Oh. But you see.
I'm kinda worth it. So...

Oh. Shit. Oh. Shit.

I can't do this.

Oh. You see.
I have evidence to the contrary.

You said
if I was still hungry...

Suzie...

Oh. Thank you. No.
It's a little early for me.

Salud.
Salud.

OK. What can I do to help?

The dishes. Don't break any.

You're such the happy helper
this evening. Aren't you?

It's called survival. Honey.

Mom?

Yeah. Honey?

What a farkakte neighborhood!

Hello!
Hi!

Hi. Mom. How are you?
Let me give you a kiss.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Hi. Uncle Stephen! How are you?

He's not deaf.
Hiya. Dad.

How are you doing?
He's not deaf.

He's just demented.

Where are the boys?
Eli!

Where's Asher?
He'll be here any minute.

Everybody move
into the living room.

Can I get you a drink?
That'd be lovely. Thank you.

You want the usual?

Alex.
Yeah.

This year. Please.
Some real wine.

Mitchell.
Aw. You don't like...

the kosher wine
we serve you. Dad?

You schlep me
all the way down here.

At least give me wine
that I can drink.

Well. That's a point
well taken. Dad.

Would you get me a tequila
while you're at it?

She's jumpin'! She's jumpin'!
She's...

Stephen.

Grandma. Grandpa!

Give me five.

Now. Eli. This is important.

First...

a quick kick in the shins
gets his attention.

Then. Using the palm. Whack!

Smack in the kisser.

Push his nose
right into his brain.

Mitchell.
What are you telling him?

Don't worry. Don't worry.

Your finish... a knee
right in the family jewels.

Mitchell. Please refrain
from filling my son's head...

with your blood-and-guts
stories.

Every boy
should know these things.

Every boy
should not know these things.

Yes. I should.
Yeah!

Not yet. Not yet.

Was he always like this?

Oh. No. Dear.

No. Uncle Stephen
was a great navy man.

Very brave.
And very dashing in his uniform.

All right. Everybody.
Let's come to the table.

Where's Asher?

He's probably hanging out
on some street corner.

We'll go ahead and start.
He'll join us when he gets here.

Manners of a caveman.
Mama. You're there.

Thank you. Mitchell.
What? He should be here.

Not yet. Stephen!

Not yet.

"We thank you.
O Lord our God...

"king of the universe...

"who created
the fruit of the vine."

Amen.

Only 1927!

Give me a hard-boiled...

This is the bread
of our affliction...

and this one is the afikomen.

I will hide the afikomen...
and don't you cheat.

"Why is it on all other nights
during the year...

"we eat bread or matzo...

"but on this night
we eat only matzo?"

Excuse me.
Now what?

I'm sorry. Son.

Alex. You have
to take this now?

This may be an emergency.

Hey. My grandson
is reading the four questions!

Eli. Please. I'm sorry.
No. It's OK.

No. No. No.
Go ahead. Start again.

Ignores his duties
at the firm for years.

Now he has to work.
Mitchell. Not now.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

What did you say?
You heard me.

You're talkin' to me about duty?
Dad. I know all about duty.

Duty to my family
as well as my work.

What about me?
Alex. Don't start this.

I mean. Where were you. Huh?
I mean. Where were you?

At least I've made an effort
to be here.

Eli. Read it like you mean it.

"Why is this night..."
Hey. Everybody.

Well. At least you got here
before Elijah did.

Uncle Stephen. Pappy. Mom.
Hello. Darling.

Hey. Little man.

Good to see you. Son.
Good to see you. Too. Dad.

Glad you could make it.
Yeah. Me. Too.

You want to find out if anybody
else would like the last piece?

Would anybody else like
this last piece of brisket?

No. Thanks.

At least somebody else here
likes the wine.

You're not doing too bad
yourself.

Mom. Mean brisket.

It's my best work yet.
Isn't it?

It's wonderful.

What is it?
Tell me. Stephen. Tell me.

Is he all right?
He's all right.

He's having a good time.

Abby Staley came back today.

Who?
What. Honey?

Abby Staley...
she came back to class today.

Who's she?
She did?

Who did?
This little girl in his class.

She ran away with an older boy.
She's twelve years old.

This happens
at artsy-fartsy school?

Kids run away?
Did you talk to her?

No. I don't even like her.

She thinks she's cooler than
everybody else in the class.

If she wants to run away.
It's OK with me.

You should be a little more
compassionate than that.

She's obviously going through
a very hard time right now.

Whatever.

Do you ever think about
running away?

Sometimes.

I would run away. Too.
From such a farkakte school.

That's helpful. Mitchell.
Come on. Dad. That's enough.

Enough!

He said it.

Good for you.

You want to tell us
why you didn't pick up...

your grandmother
from dialysis today?

Alex. You promised me
you wouldn't say anything.

It's no big deal.
I think it's a big deal.

Asher. We ask so little of you.
We counted on you...

Do you know how serious it is?

Do you have any idea
what dialysis is?

Yeah. Dad.
I do. As a matter of fact.

Kidney dialysis
is the process...

of filtering the accumulated
waste products of metabolism...

from the blood of a patient...

whose kidneys
aren't functioning properly.

You guys hear that?

If this is too much
responsibility for you...

I don't want you
fighting over me.

When I was his age...

I supported a wife. A kid...

Oh. That's not true. Dad!

When you were his age.
I wasn't even born yet.

All of you. Let it pass!
Let it be!

As a matter of fact. I had
a very interesting experience...

aFTer I leFT dialysis.

What happened?
I got in the cab...

and then I went
to my mother's old building.

Why did you do that?
Didn't you go home?

I'm not sure. I just...

I just found myself there.

I think it's a sign.

Honey. What the hell
are you talking about?

A sign? What sign?

Look. Granny. I'm sorry.
Oh. That's all right. Honey.

I'm gonna go drain my dragon.

Drain his what?
His dragon. Dear.

You can't always run away
from consequences. Asher.

Sooner or later.
You're going to have to...

Oh. Jesus.

Silent. But violent.

You win! You win! I surrender.

OK. We'll do it your way.

What?

I didn't say
you can come in here.

I didn't ask. Man.

So. What's your secret. Bro?

All this ying-yang stuff
bring the pootie tang?

What's that mean?

You got yourself a lady friend
these days?

None of your business.

Hmm. You pokin' her?

I'm eleven.

Who cares. Man?
Tell me you've at least...

slapped the old Gromberg
lip-lock on her.

Not yet. But I'm gonna.

That's all right. Man.
Come here.

How many girls
have you macked so far?

None.
None?

None?

Now. What's this
supposed to be?

It's whatever you think it is.

What does it look like to you?

Like a piece of shit.

Mitchell! He's just being
provocative. You know him.

Now he's an art critic.

Hello! What was this place.
A paint factory?

Ink factory. Dad.

Strange place
to raise kids. Huh?

Four thousand square feet.
Supportive parents.

I mean. How bad can it be. Dad?

And that's why Asher
is a social misfit.

Mitchell!
That's it.

Boys. Time for the afikomen!

Forty-nine years...
I don't know how you do it.

That's not fair. He's been
through a lot this past year.

This year isn't any different
than any other year.

He's still a ballbuster.
Except this year...

it's more difficult for him
to enunciate his insults.

When are you gonna
learn to ignore...

the things
you don't like about him...

and embrace the things you do?

He loves you.

Well. He sure has
a funny way of showing it.

Alex. He's not gonna be
around forever.

Found it!
Wow. A thousand dollars.

What?

One for me and one for Asher.

Wow!
Aren't you the lucky boy?

Thank Granny and Pappy for
being so unbelievably generous.

Thanks. Granny.
You're welcome. Honey.

Hey. My boy. My boy.

I wish you and Alex would stop.

What? Jeez.

They're waltzing. Mitchell.

Look at that.

Isn't that glorious?

I can't remember the last time
we danced together.

Hey. We're gonna still see
the end of the game.

I thought this night
would never end.

What?
Uncle Stephen.

Oh. Jesus. "Enough! Eno..."

Do you think Asher was stoned?
No.

I don't know.
It's hard to tell. Isn't it?

He's always like that.

I don't like
what's happening with him.

I feel like we're losing him.
He's twenty-one. Honey.

I wish he would talk to us.

I wish both of them
would talk to us.

I mean. What's with this?

What's going on
in that little head of his?

It's not that complicated.

He's asking for a $10 raise
each week with his allowance.

An 11-year-old boy? You don't
think this is a bit absurd?

Absolutely.
It's a highball number.

That's not what I mean.

I mean our son presented us
with a spreadsheet.

It's not about finances. Alex.

It's about our son...
both of them...

feeling comfortable
talking to us.

We're comfortable.

What do you mean?
Talking to each other.

Well. Yeah.

Compared to most couples.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Good night. Sweetie.

Hey. Watch where you're going!

On your right!
On your leFT!

Oh. I'm so sorry!
Sir. Are you OK. Sir?

Are you all right. Sir?
Would you like to sit down?

Would you like
a smack in the kisser?

Get off of me.
Sorry.

How was your walk.
Mr. Gromberg?

Mr. Gromberg?

Hi.
Hi.

I can't figure out
this damn e-mail.

It looks like Eli
sent me something...

but I can't figure out
how to reply.

Use a pen.

Mitchell?

I fell.

Are you all right?

Evelyn. Let me give you
some good advice...

never get old.

Hiya. Becky. Sweetheart.
Hi. Honey.

I know you want to wish Eli
good luck...

since you can't be here.
Here he is.

Hi. Dad.

Eli. You go get 'em. All right?

Thanks. Dad. Here's mom.

I got all your roses. Darling.
It was very extravagant.

Happy anniversary. Sweetheart.

Twenty-two years. Huh?
Twenty-two.

Happy anniversary to you. Too.

I'll see you later. Bye.

OK. See you tonight.

I love you.

Deb...

"a little rent strike"?

This is not
a little rent strike.

This is a goddamn uprising.

You can handle it.
Just be yourself.

Myself? Oh. You're talking
about that knee-jerk liberal...

who hasn't been above
86th Street in years.

Senor Gromberg.
I gotta go. Deb. Thank you.

So. Together. We will succeed...

not only in getting your heat
and hot water back on...

What did you say to them?
I don't know.

I just asked them how they felt
about hot showers.

I guess they like them.

Yay. Eli!

What you got. Man?
What you got. Drew?

What you got. Dawg?
What you got. Dawg?

All right. You ready for this.
Man? You ready for this?

Come on. Admit it. Dawg.
You checking out my ass?

You like this?
Watch this. Watch this.

Sub! Sub!

Oh. You are such a sad boy.

Come here.

Come here.

Excuse me.

I tell you. Man.

Punk ass hit me
with the body. Sheesh.

Looked like a foul to me.

What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in class?

Didn't feel like going
to class today. I guess.

What. I can't cut class?
What about you?

This is your fiFTh time
this semester.

At least someone's counting.

I couldn't care less
how many classes you cut.

You're the one
wasting the tuition. Not me.

Yeah. Well. looks like
I'm going to have to cough up...

another year's worth.

I just got a letter
from the registrar...

and they want me to
stick around for another year.

You know. My grades
are the pits. So whatever.

I'm sorry. Asher.

Yeah. It's all good.

What'd you expect?

Shit. I'm late. I got to go.
All right.

Give me your hand.

What?
Your hand. Fool.

OK.

What's this?

My digits.
OK.

Call me.
I will.

Maybe.

This is so high school.

Oh. Are you going to pretend
nothing ever happened?

Nothing did. You know. Happen.

What is that.
The Bill Clinton defense?

Because I could've sworn
something happened. You know?

Why don't you just
finish me off?

Suzie. Suzie.
I am so flattered. OK?

Oh. Good.
But we got to let this go.

Because. The truth is.
Guilt is stronger than lust.

I was so proud of you.
You did so good.

Let's put this right here...

so Dad can't miss it
when he comes in. OK?

Wonderful. I'm starving.

Eli. Dad and I talked about
your allowance request.

We have no problem
giving you more money.

We know you'll spend it wisely.

We just wish
that you'd let us know...

a little bit more
of what you're thinking...

in words.

You know what I mean?
Whatever.

I just want you to know...

that you can talk to us
about anything...

anything at all.
Whatever's on your mind.

There's nothing you can say
that will upset us.

Understood?

Do you and Dad ever sixty-nine?

Will it be the usual.
Mr. Gromberg?

The usual.
All right.

And for you. Mrs. Gromberg?
She'll have the usual.

What's good tonight. Bruno?

Well. Tonight...
tonight. We have the osso buco.

Very nice. Served
with potatoes and broccoli.

We have a veal chop cooked in
a marsala wine... very lovely.

I'll just have the usual
as well.

Oh. Good decision.

At least I entertain the idea
of trying something new...

a concept
that you've never grasped.

Let's do presents.

Oh. Maybe there's a job offer
for our oldest son in here.

Oh. Boy. Huh?
I could only hope.

Wait a minute. Ladies first.

I may be a selfish.
Money-grubbing lawyer...

but I am still a gentleman.

God knows
where you learned that from.

My mother. Of course.
Of course.

It's on order. It's got
automatic button-holing...

auto-embroidery. Auto-eroticism.

This little puppy
can do everything.

It's called a Pfaff.

A sewing machine.

I...

Thank you.

All right. Now. Wait.
Is this a schmucky thing to do?

No. No. No. No.
You always talked about...

wanting to design
your own clothes. Didn't you?

I did. Didn't I?
Yeah.

Thank you. Honey.

Gosh. I don't know
when I'll find the time...

but. You know. I will.
I'll make the time.

Open yours.

Ooh. I think I may be
the winner this year.

This is feeling awfully light...
awfully light.

Cashmere. Ooh. Now.
What did I do to deserve this?

Oh. Well. I have no idea.

Look under the socks.

Florence?
I thought that we both...

could use a little Florence.

A second honeymoon.

Honey. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

Shit.

Barney.
Go ahead. Go take it.

Nah. The hell with him.

I've taken up a new case.

The martine account
wasn't enough for you?

A pro bono.

I'm working on
a rent strike in Harlem.

Oh. Honey.

That's the best thing
I've heard you say in months.

Asher.

Asher? Asher!

Oh. Oh. What's up?
Hey. Yo. Let her in. Man.

Hey. Come on.

By the way...
What's that?

It's Katie.
I know that. Sweetie.

I'm just reminding you...
for the morning.

Can I ask you something?

Anything you want. Katie.

Whose number is that?

That?
That number right there...

is a number for the burn unit
at the mount Sinai Hospital.

You know. In case it gets
a little bit too steamy tonight.

What the hell's
going on here. Alex?

Prostitution. Drugs.
Rock and roll.

We just got a call from Waxman
over at martine.

Yeah?
How's his lisp these days?

Have you gone wacko?
Could you excuse us. Please?

Not that I'm aware of. No.

You just took opposing counsel
against a client of ours.

What do you mean?
What do I mean?

Do the words "due diligence"
ring a bell?

That project
that you just flew into...

with your goddamn pro bono cape
flapping all over the place...

happens to be owned and run
by martine.

They're threatening
to switch counsel.

That's a $9 million account
for this firm... 9 million.

They are breaking the law.
Barney.

Morning. Barney.

What's this?
They're called pupusas.

They're from Rosario.

Must I remind you
that our currency...

does not come
in the form of tortillas?

Pupusas.

You have been taken off
the martine account.

Given the facts. That probably
makes the best sense.

Might as well
take me off everything.

What was that?
Nothing.

Look. Alex. Just because
you thumbed your nose...

at becoming a partner
doesn't mean...

you don't have obligations
to this firm.

This is too big a screw-up
to ignore...

even for the founding
partner's son. Yeah.

Oh. Shit. Dad.

Alex. It's Asher
returning your call.

Hey. Ash. Where'd I catch you?

I'm in the library.

Oh. What'd they do.
Roll a couple of kegs in there?

No. Dad.
I'm just doing a little writing.

Oh. That's good. That's good.

You know. I'd love to read
something you write...

whenever it feels OK.

That's fantastic. Dad.
I appreciate that.

How's that job hunt coming?

Listen. Dad.
I'm late for class...

Ash. Ash. That's not
the reason I called you.

I wanted to know if you wanted
to go to the game tonight.

I got a couple of tickets.
You know?

Thought we'd have
a couple beers.

I can't. OK?

Ash. I'm talking about
the Yankees... box seats.

Listen. Dad.
I can't go. All right?

I'm sorry.
I'll give you a call back.

What the hell?

Hey. I'm watching the Yankees.
Turn that thing off.

Let's go.

Up. We're going to dance.

Are you out of your mind?
Just about.

That's why you're going
to turn off that damn box...

and dance with me.

Off. Mitchell. That's not off.

And if I tried

I still couldn't hide
my love for you

I wanted to see that game. Too.

Hold me.
I am holding you.

No. You fool.

Hold me like you love me.

There. That's better.

You went away

And my heart

Went with you

I speak your name

In my every prayer

If there's some other way

To prove that I love you

I'm sure I don't know how

You'll never know

If you don't know now

It's good. Isn't it?

So. How you doing. Buddy?
Everything OK?

Yeah. The game's good.

I didn't mean just the game.

The food's good.

No. I mean...

how's your life going. Eli?

Anything you want to ask
the old man?

Now's your chance.
And I've had...

a little bit of experience.
You know?

No. I'm good.

Charge!

I was thinking a nightgown...

in that mercerized
Egyptian cotton.

Oh. Lots of pictures appear.

Slinky. Yeah.

It moved. This is great.
OK. Let me get a pen...

because
I don't want to forget this.

I want to write this down.
Wait a minute.

Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.

Let's see.

Comfortable...

talking!

Evelyn! Ninth inning.
Get in here.

Lousy game.

They should've yanked that
pitcher in the third inning.

That was a big mistake...
a big mistake.

Your bath is ready!

And I'm ready. Too.

Hey. Hey. You can't take a bath
in your clothes.

Get up.

Jeez.

Get up. Woman.

Oh. No. No. No.

Don't you dare do that.

Get up. Woman.

Goddamn. Evelyn. Get up!

Get up.

Get up. Evelyn. Get up. Get up.

Well. We were wondering
what happened to you.

I thought you'd give public
transportation a break...

come out with your family today.

I always take the train.

I know you like the train. Dad.
Somebody would've picked you up.

Or I would've come
and picked you up.

Where's Uncle Stephen?

He's in bad shape.

The doctor
wouldn't let him come.

Hey. What are all these cars
doing on my place?

They're friends of mom's.
Come to pay their last respects.

When I think of my mother...

I think of her posture...

the way that she carried
herself through life.

She was upright...

with dignity. Always.

And those laser eyes
of hers...

seeing right through you.

One look from her...

and she knew what the truth was.
Whatever the situation was.

When I think of my mother...

I think of the word "grace."

That was a word
that was invented for her.

She set the standard...

in loyalty...

family pride...

and love.

And she taught me well...

in what to look for
when choosing a wife.

So. Mom. I thank you.

Hey. What the hell
are you doing?

I got to pick up
some stuff in town.

I thought I'd take it
for a ride.

What's the matter
with your kraut car?

It's Japanese. Dad.
Still the enemy.

We're not at war anymore.
Remember?

They're not the enemy.
They may be yours.

My brother lost his legs
because of some Nazi bastards.

I know that. All I want to do
is just take it for a spin.

Nobody else drives
this Chevy but me.

Fine. Fine.

You just keep
your precious car.

You shouldn't be driving
a goddamn shopping cart...

better yet a '55 Chevy.

Are you all right. Mitchell?

No.

Was everything
the way you wanted it?

The service?

Not very religious.

You're standing on one leg.

What?

An old prophet
was once asked...

"Can you tell me
the meaning of religion...

"standing on one leg?"

And what did he say?

Do unto others...

as you would have them do
unto you.

That's my belief.

We must be nice to people.

And are you?

God. No.

Did you get the bread?

Yeah.

Do you believe
in doing unto others...

as you would have them
do unto you?

What?

Your father does.

My father believes you do
to others before they do to you.

Sorry. Dad.
I couldn't resist that.

Isn't it time
you learned how. Alex...

at least occasionally.
To resist?

What do you want to eat.
Mitchell?

Fish.

We have whitefish.
And we have lox.

Fresh fish.

We don't have any fresh.

We have a lake.

Well. Why don't
you and Alex...

take the boat out
and go catch a fish?

Now?

Rebecca. This is ridiculous.

I need a partner
to row the boat.

You and me both.

Your father needs a partner.

Asher!

Ah. Jesus.

Your father's asking
for your company.

Rebecca. What is the problem?

Fish don't like that.

I got a call from Jim Lindsay
the other day. Dad.

What's he calling you about?

He said he saw
a guy out here...

who was assessing the property
on your instructions.

So? Testing the market.

Testing the market?
Yeah.

Does that mean you're
trying to sell the house?

Why do you care?

What do you mean?
I love this house.

It's got mom's memories
all over there.

Why the hell would you
even think about...

You never even
come up here anymore.

We used to come here
all the time. And we will again.

Why wouldn't you have
the decency to tell me?

Maybe Rebecca and I...

would like to take over
ownership of the property.

I'm not asking you
to give it to me. Dad.

God forbid.
We'd write you a check.

Hey. Dad. Could you chill out?
You're scaring my bites.

Asher. Don't hold
the pole like that.

Dad. Please. Let's stop with
the "moby Dick" crap. All right?

Just leave Asher
out of this whole thing.

Dad. I don't need your help.

I'm not gonna have you
bringing Asher...

into what happened to me
when I was growing up. Dad.

Is that so?
That's so. Dad. Enough. OK?

Your wife died.
I've lost my mother.

That's enough. OK?
Just... enough.

OK. Everybody. Group hug.
Come on.

Don't be a smart ass. OK?
I wasn't talking to you.

Stop trying to make everybody
cry with you all the time.

I'm sick of that.

Some men cry inside.

That's what I'm saying. Pappy.

Not everybody's a soggy
cracker like you. Dad.

Holy shit! I got a fish. Man!

Good going. He got it.

Look at that thing!

It's a big one.

I know. It's a big one.
Oh. Shit.

The net.
Where's the net?

Hurry up. Dad!
Get it up!

Use your hands!
I got it!

I've got him.
I've got him. OK?

OK. Here we go. All right.

What the hell you doing. Man?
Damn! Tell me you didn't just...

Schmuck!

What the hell?
You had it in your hand!

I'm sorry. OK?

I'm sorry!

Let's see if we can get
another one. Schmuck.

Mean brisket. Mom.

I had nothing to do with it.

What's Pappy doing?
Can you see him?

Watching TV.

How can you just sit there?

Go get him.

Dad...
Not hungry.

I'm sorry about the fish
and everything.

If you change your mind.
We'd love you to join us.

I finally get it
all the way into the boat...

and what does my father do?
He drops the slippery sucker.

Are you upset
about your grandmother?

Asher?
Yeah. I'm here.

You want to talk about it?

No. Not particularly.

I'm really sorry.

Yeah. I know.

So. What are you doing
aFTer graduation?

Doing that Eurorail...

"Get on the train
with Americans...

"who look exactly
like you" thing?

I have a job.

Of course you do.

I'm actually starting
at the end of July.

I'm going to be
an editorial assistant.

What about you?

AFTer my fiFTh year?
I have no idea.

Can I ask you
a personal question?

I don't deal with death
very well. So...

Are you wearing any
exciting undergarments?

Christ. Asher.

Does death always
make you this horny?

I don't know.
This is my first death.

Oh. Pappy!

Hello?

Yeah. No. It's my grandfather.

Look. I better get going. OK?

Peg?
Yeah?

I'm glad I called.

Me. Too.

I'll talk to you later.

Who was that?
Just a lady friend.

You schtupping her?

No. Actually. Not yet.

Why the hell not?

Let me give you
a quick pointer.

When you're ready
to close the deal...

get up. Put on your shoes
and leave.

What do you mean?

Just what I said.

Put on your shoes
and walk through the door.

That's your pointer?

Hey. Mark my words.

She'll come back
when you least expect it.

I know he thinks
he can handle it alone...

but mom.
She did everything for him.

What happens
if he has another stroke?

Breaks one of his hips?

Becca. What is this? What?

Look what the tooth fairy
leFT for you.

Oh. Jesus.

I tried to wait. I really did.
Oh. My God. Oh. Jesus. No.

I loved your mother very much.
And I know you did. Too...

but she of all people
would understand...

that I couldn't go through
the motions any longer.

Honey. I know this looks bad...
Bad?

But it is not what you think.

Oh. Bad!

I have been acting like a crazy
person for the last two days...

carrying around
another woman's panties...

wondering what the hell
to do with this!

This is nothing. It's nothing.

Nothing?
Don't tell me it's nothing!

Bec! Bec! Bec!

This is definitely
something. Alex!

Whatever the hell it is.
It's something!

And it's got lace all over it!

Nothing happened.
I'm washing dishes...

in the soup kitchen.
This woman comes up...

I don't want the details!
I'm telling the truth!

How did her frigging panties
end up in your pocket?

I don't know.

All right.

All right. Let's say that...

nothing happened.
Just like you said.

Did you want
something to happen...

with this woman. Alex?
Did you?

That's all I needed to know.

Rebecca. I can't do this
right now.

I don't expect you to.
But it's out there now...

and we're gonna have
to deal with it.

You OK. Little man?

It's so retarded.

It's OK. Don't worry. Man.

Mom and Dad'll kiss and make up
before tomorrow morning.

As gross as that sounds.

It's not mom and Dad.
It's dancing.

What?

Dancing.

There's a school dance
on Wednesday.

Yuck. It's stupid.

I don't get why anyone
would want to do that.

Isn't your lady friend
gonna be there?

You remember.

The one you wanted to slap
the ol' Gromberg lip lock on?

Whatever.

Man. Sixth grade dance.

The spring fling.

If anything's gonna go down.
That's where it's gonna happen.

Trust me.
I got your back on that one.

Yeah. Whatever.

She has a nose ring.

The runaway?

That's your girlfriend?

It's Abby. Thank you very much.

No shit.

I'm impressed. Wow. Man.

What's wrong
with a nose ring anyways?

It's in her nose.

I think I miss her.

Who. That little punk chick?

No. Granny.

Yeah.

I miss her. Too. Eli.

You'll never know

Just how much

I miss you

You'll never know

Just how much

I care

And if I try

I still couldn't hide
my love for you

Alex!

In the doghouse. Huh?

Don't ask. Dad.

Let's go for a ride.

What?

You can drive.

I had a thought.

What if you and Rebecca
took over the deed?

Which deed?

"Which deed."
The deed to the house.

Just thought about that. Huh?

Wonder what made you
think of that.

Pull over.
Lf you just hold onto it...

there's a gas station
up on route 9.

I don't have to pee.
Please pull over.

Right here.

Dad? Dad?

Dad. You OK?

I met your mother here.

I thought you met
in law school.

No. I met her...

right there.
Bake sale.

I bought a piece
of poppy seed cake.

Went in to get another
just to see her again.

I must have had six slices...

before I had the nerve
to ask her to go out.

Your mother
was the best thing...

that ever happened in my life.

I can hardly breathe
without her.

You know. For thirty years...

every Friday
I took the express...

from Grand Central.

I used to love that train ride.

Spending some time
alone with my dad.

Your mother liked
to drive up on her own...

so we'd greet each other
fresh for the weekend.

The train would roll in.
I'd step out...

and there she was.
Waiting for me.

Always.

Rebecca and I
are in some trouble.

Did you hear what I said?

Now what did you do wrong?

She thinks
I'm having an affair.

With another woman?

Yeah. Dad.
With another woman.

It doesn't surprise me.

What do you mean.
It doesn't surprise you?

You never had a real sense
of follow-through.

See? I mean. That's it.
I'm trying to talk to you...

and you can't have
one minute go by...

without trying to insult me?

I'm just telling it like it is.

Like it is
or how you'd like to see it?

Just because your old man
was a cold-hearted prick...

doesn't mean that you and I
got to be that way. Dad.

Why is it that whatever I do...

I always feel like
it's not enough.

I always feel like
I'm coming up short. Dad.

Why? What is that?

Why. Dad?

What. Mom's not here
to defend you...

you don't know what to say?

She was always ready
to serve you.

When she was here.
She was excusing...

Stop.

Don't talk about
your mother like that.

I will talk about her
any way I want...

because she is my mother.
And. Dad...

you're my father.

Couldn't you just at least...

have a little bit
of approval about my life?

Is that really
going to kill you...

just to give me
maybe that much?

What? What do you
want me to say?

That I love you?

You know.
I'm not like your mother.

I can't say everything
out loud.

It doesn't mean I don't.

And I love you. Too. Dad.

I'm not always proud
of my behavior.

Nobody is. Nobody.

And. Alex. You're a much
better father than I was.

Thank you.

But you didn't exactly
set the bar all that high.

Come on. Let's go home.

To the side if you're
gonna stop. Please!

Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

Sweet!
There we go.

You know what your problem is?
What's my problem?

You're not confused.

It's painfully obvious
that you're...

That I'm what? Paralyzed
by the fear of failure?

As long as you're aware of it.

I couldn't sleep at night.
Oh. No?

I guess we're different.

Why do you care?
Why do I care?

'Cause you're acting
like a pussy. That's why.

And I don't like hanging
out with pussies.

Pussy?

What are you doing?

Wait. Wait. Wait.
What? What's wrong?

Wait. Wait.

What? Do I have B.O.?
That's not fair.

I didn't get a chance
to shower.

I was running
all over the place.

I don't want to ruin this.
I'm sorry?

I just think what we have
going right now is so good.

I don't want to rush it.

Are you high?

No. I just think we should
respect the connection.

It's a game.

No. I'm serious.

I'll call you later. OK?

Can I call you later?

Yeah.

OK.

Mr. Gromberg.

Are you OK. Sir?

The usual.

Yes. Sir.
Thank you.

Abby Staley.

Hey. Eli. You want
to go get a drink?

No. I'm good.

All right.
Talk to you later.

Hey.
What?

How come you're
just standing here?

How come you look
like a banker?

I don't know.

My dad bought me this.

I like your bracelets.

Do you? Or are you making
a dick of yourself...

being nice to the runaway?

No. I do. They're nice.

Do you dance?

Here? No.

But I would get
the hell out of here.

So. How did Eli look
for the dance tonight?

If you had been here
to see him off...

maybe you wouldn't have to ask.

A little early for bed
tonight. Isn't it?

Excuse me.

How long are you going
to keep freezing me out?

I don't know.

I need time. All right?

Bec. I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

So am I.

I'm sorry and sad
and exhausted!

Oh. God. Just...

talk to Barney.

It's my father.

Oh. Better!

Yes. Dad.

What?

If you would just sign here.
And that should do it.

Your late brother's remains...

are now officially
in your custody.

Are now officially
in your custody.

My deepest condolences.

Thank you.

I'm assuming you've made
suitable arrangements?

Don't worry.

We will see that he gets
a fitting burial.

Asher!

What's up. Man?

Prolific.

Just waiting on my muse.

She's a bit tardy
this evening. No?

Or should I say this semester?

She'll be here. Man.
She'll be here.

As we await her arrival...

how about we do
a little drinky-poo?

Jeez. Pappy was right.

What?
Nothing. What's up?

I could hear you all
the way down in the lobby.

It's really loud.

This is my buddy
from down the hall.

Don't be fooled
by his fancy grammar.

He's really kind of
a slimeball.

Malik. This is Peg.

It's a great pleasure
to meet you.

See what I'm saying?

I thought I'd surprise you.

It's a nice surprise.

Chablis 2002.
Boxed wine.

I liked
the rectangular element.

I'll take it.
Take a seat.

So. What have you guys
been up to?

Cramming.

Yeah.

For what. Chemistry?

Well. Perhaps you'd like to try
an experiment or two.

You wouldn't lead me
astray. Would you?

No. No way.

No way.

Welcome to my laboratory.

I'm gonna get the sodas.
Get me a Pepsi.

I don't think
the graphics were better.

Hey. look! Check it out!

Over there! Let's get 'em!

Abby Staley!
With a pet!

Quick. It's Shea! Let's go!
Out the back gate!

Where the hell are you going?
Come here!

Leave me alone!

What. You don't like me
anymore. Abby?

You're a good kid. Aren't you?
Leave him alone!

What. He can't speak
for himself?

Leave him alone.
You shithead.

You believe the language?

Sixth grade gutter whore.

You think I wouldn't find you?

That's your little game.
Huh. Abby?

Leave me alone. My brother
will beat the shit out of you.

That's for your brother.

Leave her alone. Shithead!
Get him!

You little rat!

Shit! He broke my Tony Hawk!
Damn it!

He broke my goddamn board!

Go get her! Come on!

Get up!

Get 'em!
Come on!

Come on! Let's go!

Come on!
You all right. Shea?

Please be careful.
Can you handle it?

Yeah. I got it.

I think so.

OK. We'll put him in the bow.

Now. Watch out
for the ledge right there.

Yeah. Dad. Where's the bow?

Right in here.

Shit. My back.
Christ. My back.

Dad. What are you doing?
You could hurt yourself.

Someone has to do it.

Dad. This is absurd.
This is totally absurd.

It is not.

He lived by the sea.
Now he dies by the sea.

This is not a sea. Dad.

This is Lake Winnipac.
It's not the Atlantic.

It's a sailor's sky tonight.

He was in the navy. Dad.
He wasn't a Viking.

This is what he always wanted.

This is what he gets.

Dad. We got
neighbors here. OK?

The hell with them!

Jesus.

Dad?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

He held on for a while.
Didn't he?

The only way he knew how.

You could have learned
a thing or two from him.

No. I did.

I learned how to tie
36 different ship knots.

The hell with knots.

The man had character.

You could have learned
that from him.

I tried to learn that from you.

I'm getting blisters.

Let's go over here.

So. How come you hang out with
that asshole morgan Cooper?

I don't know.

How come you ran away
with that guy?

I don't know.
Thought he was cool. I guess.

Was he?

No.

Where'd you go?

Cape Cod.

Why'd you come back?

I don't know.
Guess I got bored.

Were you homesick?

Hell. No.

I don't know.

Maybe. A little.

I get homesick
when I go to camp.

That's 'cause camp sucks.

Are your parents
as boring and angry...

and always screaming
at each other like mine?

Kind of.

Do they never
talk to you like mine?

No. My parents are
always talking to me.

They ask me questions
whenever they can.

You're lucky.

No. I'm not. You're lucky.

It's OK.

You really do like it.

How come you haven't
tried to kiss me?

What? I don't know.

Do you want to?

I don't know.

'Cause. Like. You can.
You know. If you want to.

No. Thank you.

OK.

Go. Asher.

Break it down. Asher.

Go. Asher. Go. Asher.

Police!

What's going on here?
What's all this noise?

Asher! Asher!

Where the hell do you think
you're going?

What are you doing?

Against the wall.

Spread your legs.
Spread your legs.

Asher!

I'm so sorry. Peg.

I'll give you something
to be sorry about.

My keys. My keys.

Asher.

What have you gotten into?

What's happening?

Hey. No talking.

Jesus.

Jesus. Man.
What are you doing?

I can't believe I trusted you.

Closet back here?

No. I don't know.
It's not mine.

Yeah. Right.

Let's get this
out of the way.

Move that thing.

You got a key for this?

No. I told you.
I've never used it before.

Come on. Get something...
anything.

Give me the door lock.

Asher.

Oh. My God.

Holy shit.

Jackpot.

How about this
for a noise complaint?

Wow. We're looking
at fiFTeen years here.

What do you think? There must
be eight plants in here.

I don't want anything
to do with you ever again.

Peg. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

I'll do something. I promise.

I can see the headlines now...

"Father and son burn uncle
in makeshiFT Viking funeral.

"Wife and children shamed."

Is this legal. Dad?

All right. So what do we do?

We say something or...

It's not about words.

I'm sorry. Of course.
You've done this before.

It's about this man's
connection with the sea.

It's not about you or me...

or words of grace.

Push it to the water line.

All right.

Now...

when I say. "Ahoy"...

give it a big shove
out to sea.

Aye. Aye. Captain.

Sorry. Dad.

Look. We don't have to do this.
You know that.

We're doing it.

Ahoy. Ahoy!

We got to go. Dad.

Dad. Dad. Come on.
We got to go.

Dad. We got to go.

Thank you. Alex.

Thank you.

You know. We could go to jail.

If we're lucky.
We might be cellmates.

Yeah. Hi. Honey.

What?

Bec. Is he OK?
Where is he?

They're processing his papers.
They had to fingerprint him.

Oh. Jesus.

He'll probably get off.
The little sneak.

The police
didn't have a warrant.

Thank God.
He's always getting off.

That's part
of the problem. Alex.

It can't go on like this
any longer.

Look at us.
Can you believe this?

You OK?

I'm still here. Aren't I?

Asher. Honey.

I didn't know the shit
was there. Mom. I swear.

Save it. Asher. Do you realize
how serious this is?

I'm so sorry. Dad.

I'm sorry. Too. Buddy.

I'm sorry. Too.

Oh. God.

Asher. Do you know
you could've gotten...

up to fiFTeen years for this?

I'm such a screw-up.

You're not.
You are not a screw-up.

Yes. I am.
You're not.

Does Pappy have
to see me this way?

Everything's screwed up. Dad.

Everything's shit. Dad.

I was with this girl
who was there.

She didn't do anything.

I don't know where she is.
She's going to hate me now.

This just gets
better and better.

It's OK. It's OK.

You have to help her.
Please. Dad.

We got to make sure
she's all right.

It's all right. Asher.
We'll take care of her.

Don't worry about her.
She'll be all right.

There was no search warrant.
Thank God.

It's OK.

And I've also screwed up
with school. Mom.

I'm going to have to go
back for another year.

You're failing
your senior year?

My life is shit!

You're a bright kid.
For God's sake.

I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't get into it.

What the hell can you do?
Sell drugs?

Now. Wait a minute.
Let's face this. All right?

We have all been in our own
little worlds. Haven't we?

It's going to stop right now.

We're a family. We're going
to figure this out together.

Figure what out?
This? And school and...

And everything else.
That's right.

Asher. You're not
a kid anymore.

You got to find out what
is important in your life...

what do you love. And you let
nothing get in the way of it.

Asher. Listen to your father.

He knows what
he's talking about.

Oh. God.

Who's calling you now?

I don't know.
This is probably a patient.

Hello.

Mrs. Gromberg?
Yes.

This is mrs. Hodgson.
Is Eli with you?

What?

He disappeared
from the dance tonight...

Is he in there?

Yeah.

You are staying here
with us tonight.

I don't want you
out of my sight.

Where should I sleep?

Why don't you sleep
in your old room with Eli?

We've got a lot
of talking to do.

But in the morning.

I couldn't take one more
surprise tonight.

Good night. Honey.

I'm going to bed.

Good night. Mom.
Good night. Boys.

What about me?

What about you?

Where do I sleep?

Couch.

What are you doing?

I was getting
in bed with my wife.

Are you out of your mind?
Aren't things confusing enough?

We have two kids.
Both of them weird.

Very weird. Alex.

One of them is a drug dealer.
And the other one is...

What's Eli? He's what?

I don't know
what the other one is.

But. Alex. Do you want
to work at this?

Yes.
Really work at this?

Yes. I do. Yes.

Will you see her again?

No. I'm not...
I wasn't seeing her.

Look. Rebecca.
I got sidetracked...

with the office
and the soup kitchen...

and I wasn't paying attention.

Life... it's always getting
in the way of us. Isn't it?

Yeah.

The couch.
Rebecca.

The couch.

Alex?
Yeah.

In the morning. There are
three things you can do.

You can get our son
a good lawyer...

find us a marriage counselor...

and you can wash the dishes...

in our kitchen.

I love you. Bec.
Good night.

I love you. Too.

What the hell
are you doing. Dad?

Insulin.

Your mother used to do this.

You going to be
comfortable here?

In the war. I slept
in blood-filled trenches.

Hope you don't mind
if I join you.

No. You take this couch.

Thanks. Dad.

Still in the doghouse?

Well. Dad. I thought
we'd relive my childhood.

You know. All those nights
we went out camping together.

Yeah. I remember.

Oh. Yeah. In your dreams.
You were a pain in the ass.

Yeah. We had a lot of nights
out together. Didn't we. Dad?

You should've seen him.
He was. Like. Seven feet tall.

Huge. Like The Rock.
When he swung his board at me...

I just put my fist
right through it.

Broke it in half...
A Tony Hawk. Too.

And when he got up.
He charged at me.

But I just went like this.
And I kicked him in the shin.

Then I went...

right in his mug.
Laid him out.

Smack in the kisser.

Good night. Boys!

Good night. Eli!

Good night. Pappy.
Good night. Dad.

Night. Dad. Night. Pappy.

Good night. Mom.

Night. Mom.

Good night.

You'll never know

How much I love you

How many verses
do you know. Dad?

It's a lullaby
that puts me to sleep.

It's keeping me awake.

Bro.

What's that bracelet all about?

You get that for taking care
of your lady?

No. Man. That's
a good thing. Buddy.

I wish I had done the same.

I'll never find

I never could hide

I guess I'm not the father
I thought I was.

I got one kid
who could be in the can.

And the other one...

There's something about him.
I don't know what it is.

You know. When we were kids.
Stephen and I...

we got in trouble
with the cops.

Really? You never told me.
What for?

Selling booze
that fell off a truck.

We did OK. Too.

Dad. I'm thinking about
leaving the firm.

I want to try
public office again.

I've waited ten years
to hear you say that.

Really?

Maybe this time
you'll vote for me?

Not a chance in hell.

Dad. You're not planning
on this becoming...

a permanent arrangement.
Are you?

Don't worry.

The doctor says I've only got
a few good years.

Don't worry.

You'll never know

Just how much I miss you

You'll never know

Just how much I care

And if I tried

I still couldn't hide

my love for you

You ought to know

For haven't I told you so

A million or more times

You went away

And my heart went with you

I speak your name

In my every prayer

If there is some other way

To prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how

You'll never know

If you don't know now

You went away

And my heart went with you

I speak your name

In my every prayer

If there is some other way

To prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how

You'll never know

If you don't know now

If there is some other way

To prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how

You'll never know

If you don't know now
