Fuck my lungs with smog.

Do you have an outlet

No.

I want to lash out.

I have for everyone,
everything!

(THUMPING CHEST)
Just to fucking purge

"Purge."

Interesting term.

You may have a chance
to purge soon.

REPORTER 10:
We are now only days from this

controversial experiment,
this night of legalized crime

that people are now
calling the Purge.

And there are protests
all over.

Conflict between
anti-Purge protesters

<i>and Purge supporters broke out
early today in North Carolina.</i>

REPORTER 11: Yes, Susan,
I'm here in Charlotte.

There's been about
20 arrests so far,

and we'll keep you informed
as protests

<i>are continuing.</i>

(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

Staten Island, the chosen site,

has become the focus
for the entire world.

We have reporters
across the island

who will be giving live updates
for the next several days.

Let's go now to correspondent
Van Jones, who's in Park Hill.

VAN: Yes, James. I'm here
outside the Park Hill Towers,

a low-income housing project,
and I can see citizens are...

Isaiah, our tower
made the news.

ISAIAH:
Are you serious?




Dolores. Good morning.

Have you seen Tony?

My sink is leaking again.

Good morning, sweetie.

I'm so sick of this
piece of shit building.

The damn elevator's
down again, too.

As bad as my asthma is, got me
sweating like a fucking snitch.

We need five or six supers
in this raggedy motherfucker.

I'll let him know what's up
if I see him.

Thank you.
You're welcome, sweetie.

Hey.

This bullshit experiment
really happening, Ny?

Talk to you later, okay?
All right, sweetie.

The Pope has continued
his condemnation of the Purge.

And France's president,
Lemercier, has called upon...

I'll see you later, bro.
I'm out.

I'll see you tonight.
A'ight.

JAMES: ...if the NFFA
doesn't stop this, quote,

"barbaric experiment."

Locally, protestors
have started to gather

at the evaluation sites,

as well as outside
local government offices.

(WATER DRIPPING)
So far,

there has been no sign
of violence,

but tensions are high
as the clock ticks.

MAN:
<i>Are you an angry person?</i>

Who ain't?

Just tell me what I need to do
to get paid.

If you remain on Staten Island
during the experiment,

you will receive monetary
compensation of $5,000.

You'll give me $5,000

just to stay home
during this thing?

How would you know if I stayed?

We would implant
a tracking device in your arm.

Not harmful.

And if you decide
to participate beyond that,

there would be
further compensation.

What do you mean,
"participate"?

Go out, release your anger.

You mean kill someone?

If you feel compelled.

Okay. Let's do this.

I need the money.

NEWS ANCHOR:
<i>Let's go to our News Four</i>

<i>on-the-scene reporter
at the Park Hill Towers.</i>

REPORTER:
<i>This is one of a dozen sites</i>

<i>being set up across the island
where citizens are signing up</i>

<i>to participate
in the experiment.</i>

They are also being
psychologically evaluated here

to determine
their mental status

<i>before they purge.</i>

<i>And they will be
evaluated again</i>

<i>after the experiment,
if they survive,</i>

<i>to see how they
were affected by the night</i>

<i>that is being described
as a "societal catharsis."</i>

WOMAN:
Are you angry?

Damn straight.

People around here been making
fun of us our whole lives.

We keep to ourselves, but they
just won't leave us alone.

Are you ever inclined
to hurt someone?

What do you think, Doc?

The island was chosen
because its demographic

is a perfect representation...

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
REPORTER: <i>There are numerous</i>

<i>drug and street gangs
on Staten Island.</i>

<i>Many are wondering
if they'll participate.</i>

<i>Many citizens are leaving.</i>

<i>For those staying,
the financial reward</i>

<i>seems to be the incentive.</i>

REPORTER 2:
Despite the weather conditions,

the protesters are out.

They have their signs,
and their fists are raised.

They are against the Purge
experiment that is happening.

This is wrong!

CROWD:
Do not purge! Do not purge!

Walk away from their money!

Do not purge!

Do not participate!
Do not purge!

Do not participate!

VAN: <i>So we are here
with Arlo Sabian.</i>

<i>He is the chief of staff
for the NFFA.</i>

<i>He got this whole thing
pushed through Congress.</i>

Well, you got protests
all over the place now.

Please. The idea of the Purge
was analyzed for years.

We allowed island citizens
to vote on participation.

They voted yes.
Yeah, and you know why?

Because a lot of those people
felt coerced by the fact

they don't have money
and you're offering money.

So, what do you say
to the lower-income people

who are out here
risking their lives tonight?

Well, Van, as with
any scientific trial,

those who participate
receive payment.

You know, I'm gonna turn
to you, Dr. Updale.

You are the behavioral
scientist

who actually came up
with this whole experiment.

A lot of people have
a lot of concerns about this,

and one concern comes up
over and over again.

I want the truth from you.

Is the Purge
a political device?

I do not work for the NFFA.

I did not conceive
of the experiment for them.

The NFFA had the courage
to test it,

but the conceit
is not a political one.

It is a psychological one.

The benefit of acting violently
without worry of consequence,

that's a freeing violence.
"A freeing violence."

Okay, that's a...
that's a new one on me.

I have a question for you.

What is your definition
of success?

Well, the level
of participation

in certain areas is key.

Uh, the Park Hill Towers,
for example,

are the center
of this community.

If there's considerable
participation there,

I think that'll be
a strong indication

that this night
is a great success.

Well, we'll see.
NYA: They have monetized

and incentivized murder.
CROWD: Yeah!

Walk away from their money!
Yeah!

The wealthy areas
are already clearing,

but the NFFA knew that we,
"the impoverished,"

would stay if there
was monetary gain.

(CROWD SHOUTING IN AGREEMENT)

This is another way

to keep the brown
and black people down!

CROWD:
Yes!

(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY)

(MUSIC STOPS)
CROWD: Do not purge!

Do not participate!
Do not purge!

Do not participate!

Do not purge!

Look at all of this.

Everybody want to be
a gangster.

You really think
these regular folk

gonna pop each other like
gangsters when the time comes?

Shit yeah. People pissed.

They ain't got no money.
They ain't got no food.

They gotta release their anger.
Bullshit.

They participate,
it'll be for that paper.

Trust me.
Nah.

People gonna riot.

They gonna steal,
act like clowns and all that,

but there ain't gonna be
that much killing.

Nah, killing comes
from the heart, B.

Yeah.
A damaged heart.

These people, they don't got
that type of damage.

Do not participate!
Do not purge!

Believe me.
Do not participate!

Do not purge!
Do not participate!

Do not purge!
MAN: D!

You come to see the show?

OG.

All three of you old men
out today?

What's the occasion? Am I...

Am I the luckiest man
in the world?

Three kings at your service.

Nah, we the Three Wise Men.

Man, who are you fuckers
kidding?

We the Three Stooges
on our best day.

Moe, Larry, Jheri curl.


What you think
about all this here, Fred?

Oh, man.

Look here.

This is the greatest shit show
on Earth.

They turning our island
into ancient Rome.

Our hood into the Colosseum.
Now, the question is:

Are we gonna be the Christians
or the lions?

Gladiators or the slaves,
right?


Stay safe, Three.

If you need anything...

We three okay, man.

We done seen it all
and then some.

We three, we've been
through some shit.

DMITRI:
Y'all be easy.

Hey, tough guy.

You here to participate
or protest?

Still fighting
the good fight, woman?

Fighting the only fight.

Oh, I see.

No cops, no law.

Sounds like a dream come true
for a man in your business.

You got me wrong
on this one, Ny.

I don't like it.

Why not?

I don't know what it is.

When I don't know
exactly what something is...

I don't trust it.

Not one bit.

(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

Keep it moving, man.

Hey, yo, pocket that money
quick, son.

And then send these niggas
on their way, a'ight?

Man, listen.

We one of Dmitri's top corners
'cause we keep shit moving.

A'ight.

Let's go, man.

FRED:
Isaiah.

Your sister know you here?

You're better than this, son.

Come by the shop,
you want a job.


(LAUGHING)
The fuck you doing, man?

You got a customer.

The customer.

The-the one and only.

What you need, Skeletor?

Mmm, yeah, I smell your sweat.

Innocent Isaiah just...

(INHALES DEEPLY)
fresh-fresh.

What the fuck
you talking about, nigga?

Ah, you green.

Our first transaction's
on you, hmm?

A little initiation fee
to get my biz

with your fine-ass sister.

Hey, yo, fuck you, fiend.
Move on.

Get the fuck out
of my face, man.

A blood baptism for Innocent I.

Sure enough.

See, that's what
the doctor ordered.

And I'm the practicing
practitioner!

(ISAIAH YELLS)
(SKELETOR LAUGHING)

Yo, hold up, hold up.

MAN:
Yo, yo! Yo, we out!

Hey, yo, clear out, yo!

Hey, yo, come on, Isaiah.
Come on.

Come on.
He cut me, man.

For real?

DMITRI: I called y'all here
to discuss this experiment.

I don't give a shit what other
people do during Purge night.

I care about what you all do.

You get hurt or you die,
I lose money.

And I don't lose money.
Word. Word.

And we got enemies, right?
Yeah, true.

Niggas might use the night
to make a move on us.

Maybe the police
might use the night

to take out motherfuckers
like us.

Who knows?

Point is, we gotta
be prepared for anything.

So we lay low.

We stay inside, and we protect

what needs protecting.
Word. - That's what's up.

Our kin, our skin,

our product and our money.

Yo, D. We should all
just go to Brooklyn.

You know what I mean?
So we don't even take a chance.

Nah.
Nah, we can't move our money

or our stash off the island.
It's too risky.

And it'll make us look weak.
Come on, my G.

This is bullshit.
I want to fucking purge, man.

I want to tear shit up
and have some fucking fun.

For the first time in my life,

I could be
a law-abiding citizen.

(LAUGHS)
(OTHERS MURMURING)


MAN:
Oh!


If you so much as blink,

Blaise will remove the skin
from your face, fat man.

She does exactly what I say.

You know why?

We're family.

I put food on her table,

and I put money in her pocket.

My only question for you is:

I put food on your table.

Why don't I get the same type
of discipline

from your big ass?

My bad, D.

I'll stay home.

Good boy.

DMITRI: Let's get through
this Purge bullshit

so we can get back
to business as usual.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

D.

There's been an incident.

(WATER RUNNING)
Isaiah, man.

What you thinking?
(DOOR CLOSES)

(SIGHS)
NYA: Isaiah, you home?

Yeah. I'm just showering, sis.

Did you hear what happened
at Fourth and...

Isaiah, what's going on?

Why's there blood on the floor?
Are you good?

(DOOR RATTLING)
Yeah, I-I cut myself shaving.

You need facial hair
in order to shave, boy.

Open up the door,
or I'll kick it in.

You know I will.
(DOOR RATTLING)

A'ight.

Jesus Christ,
what happened to your neck?

(ISAIAH SIGHS)

MAN:
Keep your left up.

Jab, jab, jab.

Get it out, get it out!

There you go.

Hey, hey!

MAN:
It's all locked and loaded.

We're gonna have
at least 20 soldiers

surrounding this place,

keeping it secure
during the experiment.

Me and Blaise
will be at the stash house

with about two dozen niggas
on the perimeter.

We'll be protected.

PLAYERS:
Oh!

The eyes, Terence!

The eyes, the eyes.

Your eyes went right to Aesop.

Now, me, you, everybody know
you tossing to Sop.

You ain't talking, but you
telling me everything, man.

Let's pay attention to that.

Everything else
is good money, a'ight?

Let's keep up the pace,
a'ight, boys?

Whoa, what are you doing?

Thanks, D. Appreciate it.
Of course.

Run it from the top.
NYA: Let me through!

Let me through!
Get your hands off of me!

Don't touch me.
Yo.

Put your hands on me
one more time,

I'll rip your fucking
balls off. Believe that.

PLAYERS:
Ooh.

To what do I owe this...

Cut the shit.
I need to talk to you now.

My office.

â™ª Motherfuckin' joke â™ª

â™ª Steph Wes stay with
the fuckin' pole â™ª

â™ª You fuck around â™ª

â™ª And get poled... â™ª
(DOOR CLOSES)

You son of a...

Yo, yo, yo.
I don't believe you.

What is it? What's up?

Isaiah was just cut

by some junkie
off one of your corners.

What? Is he all right?
He's going to be fine.

He didn't want to go
to the hospital,

'cause he was too afraid
I was going to find out

he's been hooking school,

working the corner
for the past week.

I had no idea
he was involved, Nya.

Oh, bullshit.
You think I know

who works my corners?
Nya, come on. Nya.

I would never let Isaiah get
anywhere close to the business.

You know that.

I watched that boy grow up.

Why'd he... why'd he do it?

Why else?

He's sick of struggling.

He wanted to make life
a little bit easier for us

with some extra cash.
And I told you I would

give you money for that.
Stop.

I'll never take
your blood money.

You know that.

I-I tried talking to him.

I tried...
I tried being his mother,

his father, his brother,
his sister, but clearly,

I'm not doing a good enough job.
Nya, Nya, hey.

Clearly, I can be...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

It's a'ight. I got you.

I want you to stay with me
during the Purge, a'ight?

You and Isaiah.

As far as that...

as far as that fiend
who hurt your brother, I'm-a...

I'm-a take care of that,
a'ight?

Take care of it?

Yeah.

What you gonna do?

You gonna hurt him, kill him?
Ny, come on.

No, no, no, no. 'Cause that's
your answer to everything.

Right? That's who you are.

Today, it was two people
we know,

but every day,
it's at least two

who are hurt 'cause of you, D.

I know no other way.


I grew up here, too.

We all have to make
choices in life

to heal or to hurt,
and you chose the latter.

(SIGHS)
Don't you care

about this Purge or what it
could do to our community?

I mean...

More selfish bullshit.

Wow.

Now, the Purge is one day.

You, Dmitri,

destroy this community
364 days a year.

You weren't always like this.

The man I knew and loved
years ago

had courage and had soul.

I miss that man.

But thank you for the invite.

I, uh, uh...

We're gonna be fine
without you.

Oh.
Uh, um...

Stay the fuck away from us,
Dmitri.

(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

WOMAN:
<i>And you're angry.</i>

ISAIAH:
Yes.

I'm angry.

Very angry.

You want to release that anger?

I need to.

Thank you for
your honest answers.

First, a few formalities.

Baptisias, the official flower
of the experiment.

They represent rebirth.

In the box,
you have recording lenses.

Contacts.

Should you choose
to actively participate,

wear them on the evening,

and they'll document
everything you do.

As I said,
greater participation

yields greater
financial compensation.

Next, we'll implant
a tracking device.

After that, you'll be all set,
as they say...

to purge.

â™ª â™ª

MAN: What do you mean,
I can't get off?

MAN 2:
No, let me through!

(HORNS HONKING)
Turn around. You gotta get out.

No.
Let me off this island!

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

A lot of people you know
are gonna be there, okay?

Why can't we just stay home?

Selina, because we can't, okay?

This is the safest place
in the neighborhood.

I'm scared.
I'm gonna take care of you.

I won't let anything happen,
okay, <i>mamita?</i>

Okay.

Hey.
(CHUCKLING)

Okay, come on.
Okay.

<i>Venga, ven.</i>
Let's hurry up.

(QUIET CHATTER)

Hey.
Hey.

Luisa, Selina.

Hey. Oh, I didn't expect
to see you.

I thought you would have left
the island by now.

Oh, I was going to,
but, you know, the money, Nya.

$5,000 to stay?

That's life-changing for us.

We need it.
Yeah.

Pastor Almory opened up
the church to everyone.

Mm-hmm.
Okay? We got cots.

There's gonna be security
at the door, food.

And Pastor's going to deliver
a sermon later tonight.

DOLORES:
Oh, Lord, forgive me.

Pastor's a wonderful man,

but his sermons
bore me to death.

It's a goddamn
snooze fest, okay?

(LAUGHTER)
DOLORES: Yeah.

Why don't you make
yourselves at home?

Anything you need.
ALMORY: You'll be all right.

Thank you for coming.

Thank you so much.

Thank you for coming.

Of course. I appreciate it.

Hey, y'all doing good?

We gonna be all right.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

Sis.

Are you there yet?

I'm-I'm already
in Brooklyn, sis.

A block away from Uncle...
Uncle T's place.

Um, I-I got the last bus
off the island.

Yeah, I wish you were with me.

I know. I know.

But I just had to get
as many people

off the street
and into the church as I could.

Stay safe.

I'll be fine.

He's got a whole bar up there.
Are you kidding me?

Thank the Lord.

Monopoly is not gonna get me

Oh. He gonna see you.

Mm-hmm.
ALMORY: ...no man but God.

(CONGREGATION MURMURING)

It tastes like old-man ass.
(LAUGHS)

Don't ask me how I know.

You sure you don't want a swig?

No, thank you, Dolores.

Okay. Gonna be a long night.

Every dark night,

(OTHERS MURMURING)
Tough guy.

What you think
you're gonna do with that?

Stand down, motherfucker.
Yo!

I'm exercising my right to
purge by taking all your merch.

And if you stand in my way,
I will fuck you up!

MAN: Motherfucker.

Let's fucking purge, y'all!
Yeah!

I'm coming for my free shit.


Get back, get back, man!
Hey, you get back, nigga!


Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chill, chill.

Fall back. Yo, Isaiah.

Damn, K. Scared the shit

Oh, I see. You out here looking

There's a Purge party
down the block.

What the hell is a Purge party,
my nigga?

Nigga, I don't know.
Could be fun, though.

Let's go find out.

Maybe your boy
Skeletor's there.

Let's go, y'all. We out.

There's nothing happening.

Look at this.

Some kind of block party.

There are actually a couple

(SKELETOR GROWLS)


Where you gonna run to, Isaiah?

You can't run from me.

I'm the night, Isaiah.

I'm gonna find you.

UPDALE:
It's starting.

The basic tenets of morality
have to be abandoned.

Religious dogma
must be dropped.

People are beginning
to participate.

Don't get too excited.

NEWS ANCHOR:
And to this point, we've seen

mostly looting and vandalism,
with only a few instances

of real violence
across the island.

ANNE: Take, for example,
the Park Hill Towers,

the center of the community.

Many people are looking at them

as a gauge
of the Purge's success,

but so far,
it's been relatively quiet.

that you could use their purge

to take my ass out, but...

Didn't anybody tell you, A?

I don't know how to die.

You can't purge me, man.
I purge you.

Yo, D.

never to step foot
on this island again.

(TWO GUNSHOTS)

(DISTANT SCREAMING)

How accurate are these figures?

They were just updated, sir.

You predicted a much higher
level of participation.

UPDALE: We should have
expected the unexpected.

This is an experiment.

There are variables.

Variables?
Human nature.

Behavioral patterns vary
according to environment.

Data suggests
that this socioeconomic group

is not reacting the way
that I predicted.

Question is: Why?

I don't give a shit why.

The NFFA put a lot of faith
into this evening.

If it's deemed ineffective,
the entire regime

could be judged as a failure.

I told you that science

does not obey the laws
of politics.

My job is to analyze this data,
nothing more.

(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Excuse me.

I have to take this.

Yes, sir.

(DOOR OPENS)

Yes, sir, we're looking
at the data right now.

We've gotta get to the church.

We'll be safe there.

What do you want me to say?

That I'm wrong and I'm sorry?

That I learned
my lesson tonight?

Or that I was just being
plain-ass stupid?

Yeah, that's what
I want you to say.

I just said it.

I fucking hate
our apartment, Nya.

The leaks, roaches.

The fact that we never
have anything for anything.

I don't like it, either,
but there are other ways.

Are there?

'Cause I ain't seeing 'em.

I ain't seeing a way out, Nya.

(CLATTERING NEARBY)

When I was with Dmitri,
I saw a lot of stupid shit.

People getting hooked.

Friends getting locked up.

I've been down this road
before,

and I saw a way out.

Just let me help you
see it, too.

Deal?

Deal.

(LAUGHTER, WHOOPING)

(TIRES SQUEALING)

(MAN WHOOPS)

MAN:
Yeah!

Where the hell
did they come from?

We are seeing
an interesting trend

emerging tonight.

Some of the people
participating in violence

have been seen wearing masks
and disguises.

The whole world is watching
and wondering...

â™ª When nighttime comes â™ª

â™ª I close my eyes â™ª

â™ª Uh-huh,
when nighttime comes â™ª

â™ª When nighttime comes â™ª

â™ª I close my eyes â™ª

â™ª Uh-huh,
when nighttime comes â™ª

â™ª When nighttime comes â™ª

â™ª I hide my face â™ª

â™ª Uh-huh â™ª

â™ª And I lower my crown â™ª

â™ª I close my eyes. â™ª

ANNE (OVER TV):
And psychologists are already

speculating about why
they're doing this,

why they're disguising
their identities.

Is it that the participants
are ashamed of this need,

ashamed that they want to
commit these acts of violence?

Have you seen the chief?
Or is the regalia

just a chance for them
to add ceremony and jubilee

to this night of lawlessness?

â™ª Well, how 'bout
the new generation? â™ª

â™ª How 'bout
the new elevation? â™ª

â™ª What you gonna do
when you make it? â™ª

â™ª Hop out the Lamb,
then I skated â™ª

â™ª I brought the gang
with me... â™ª

DMITRI:
So I...

I release my anger, right?

I'm-I'm... I purged, right?

I'm a new man now, right?
Uh-huh.

Fuck, man.
(LAUGHING)

That's dumb shit, man.
Yo, boss, I was thinking.

You want me to try
to find some new girls

to bring up to your office
tonight?


Fuck you, Seven.

Fuck you seven
different ways, man.

Oh, shit.

Look at these crazy fuckers
bucking the system, yo.

DMITRI:
Oh, shit, I mean,

that's illegal,
so I guess they purging, too.

Yo, I'll purge like that
every night.

A large group of people

are participating
on Main and Third.

Gang activity across the island
on multiple screens.

Participation levels
increasing.

Increasing violence
on various screens.

Purgers everywhere,
especially in low-income areas.

All data supported
early violent behavior

and then a downturn.

This doesn't make any sense.

Where are these gangs
coming from?

Why weren't they out earlier?

NEWS ANCHOR: <i>Islanders

LUISA: Nya!

Sorry, sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.

It's us.
Jesus Christ.

You scared the shit out of me.

Are you okay?

What the hell happened
in there?

Bastards went inside.

About a dozen of them
started shooting at everyone.

We had to pretend we were dead.

We covered ourselves
in somebody else's blood.

I'm so glad you're okay.

D-Dolores. Dolores.

Where's Dolores?
Have you seen her?

We don't know.
We don't know where she is.

She left earlier.
She went looking for you.

Isaiah, try Dolores's cell.
See if you can find her.

No, no.
No.

No!

Some people got out, Nya.

But not everyone.

They badasses for hire.

They'll work

as long as the cash is correct.

Like Blackwater
back in the days.

Usually ex-military,
and not just American.

These fuckers
are the real deal.

Show me Park and Fourth
ten minutes ago.


Here.

UPDALE:
Follow those trucks backwards.

Use drones, street cams,
whatever you need access to,

to see where the hell
they came from.

SABIAN: There's purging
going on all over the city.

It's turning.

I knew it would.
MAN: Sir.

We have a breach
inside a private office.

I tracked those trucks
all the way

across the island to here:

a remote area
of abandoned factories.

Watch this now.

At around midnight,
something strange happens.

I did a vehicle search
on all systems,

and every one of these vehicles
ended up in Park Hill,

Mariners Harbor and Stapleton.

The low-income areas
of the island.

And they're attacking
crowded places:

churches, apartment buildings,
Purge parties.

The gangs know
where people are gathering

because of
the tracking implants.

How would gangs know
how to monitor

the tracking implants?

They're not gangs.

I want all this footage
on a flash drive.

SABIAN: Did you really think
you could just snoop around

an NFFA building?
I know what you're doing.

You're sending soldiers
into the island

disguised as gangs,
as citizens,

hunting people down
using the tracking implants.

You're making it look
like people are participating

because there wasn't
enough purging.

But they're not soldiers.

They're mercenaries
from all over.

This country
is overpopulated, Doctor.

There's too much crime,

too much unemployment...
Is that even true, or did you

falsify those numbers, too?
And a bankrupt government

that can't afford to care
for its own citizenry.

People don't want us
to raise taxes?

Our debt has tripled.
We can't pay for anything.

We, the NFFA...

we inherited all this mess.

All right,
something needed to be done.

Not like this.
Well, what then?

You tell me, because we
exhausted every possibility.

I need for this to work.

I need to sell this
on a country-wide scale

because this is our last hope.

You're trying to depopulate
the lower classes

just so the NFFA
doesn't have to support them.

Come on.

We both know there's...

there's no easy answer
where somebody...

some group doesn't suffer.

What have I done?

You saved us.

I thank you for it.

No. No.

Don't-don't do this.

The American people
don't need this.

Do not build this on a lie.
I'm terribly sorry.

I was wrong.
The NFFA and America

will remember you fondly
as a hero to your nation.

a big new batch

from an unknown supplier.

This shit was cheap,
got all new tech.

I snatched it all up, yo.

The hell is this?

This is an explosive device.

It's like C-4
with a handheld detonator.

NFFA been putting all this shit
in the streets, y'all,

hoping that we'd off
each other.

We didn't, and now they're
stoking the fire

in another motherfucking way.

Our neighborhood
is under siege, gentlemen,

from a government who doesn't
give a shit about any of us.

Now, there's a lot
of good people out there

who we're gonna have
to protect now.

See, the NFFA forgot
about one thing.

They forgot about us.

(GUNS COCKING)

This is our home.

So let's show these
white-haired motherfuckers

never to fuck
with our island again.

Let's go.
Let's go.

â™ª â™ª

Thank you, sir. That's more
than we could've imagined.

Yeah, it seems like
the people...

people really needed this.

Okay.

Now make that footage
disappear.

(KNOCKING)
DOLORES: It's me.

It's Dolores! Open up!
What the fuck?

Well, I guess nobody
missed me, huh?

Dolores, you're okay.

No, I'm not okay.

I was out there looking
for your little narrow ass.

I was scared to death
out there.

I lost my damn cell phone.

I couldn't call nobody
for help.

Then I get the bubble guts,
tried to run home.

That was a bad idea
'cause I realized

I don't have my asthma pump.

Oh, but it gets better.

'Cause I shit on myself
a little bit

when I was on my way home.
(QUIET LAUGHTER)

My fucking bowels
done joined the Purge, too.
