MONSTER: It is with considerable difficulty
that I remember the original era of my being.

All of the events of that period
appear confused and indistinct.

A strange multiplicity
of sensations seized me.

And I saw, felt, heard
and smelled at the same time.

And it was indeed a long time
before I learned to distinguish

between the operations
of my various senses.

I remember a stronger light
pressed upon my nerves

so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.

Darkness then came over me
and troubled me.

But hardly had I felt this when
by opening my eyes as I now supposed

the light poured in upon me again.

(GASPING)
(INSTRUMENTS BEEPING)


Okay. Hold on.


(BEEPING STOPS)

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)


So beautiful.

You're a miracle.

(DOOR OPENS)

You're so beautiful.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

It's okay. Don't be scared.

I don't think you can see.

Unless it's very close,
it takes a newborn days to master that.

He's alive.

He's conscious. He's conscious.
(MONSTER WHIMPERING)

Could this be muscle spasms?
No, no.

Look at the way he looks at me, Victor.

Look at the way he looks at me.
(GULPING)

He needs water.

I'm going to get you
a drink of water, yep.

Open. Ah...

(COUGHING)
Oh! (GRUNTING)


Such trauma.

(ELIZABETH SCREAMING)


ELIZABETH: Get him up! Get him up!

He's alive!
(LAUGHING)

He's alive!

(LAUGHING)
Shh!

(MONSTER MUMBLING)

It's okay.

Shh...

What?

Let me try him.

Try. Here. (SHUSHING)

Be careful. Careful.

Trusting that he has
the reflex of a newborn.

Yeah.

Will you look at that.
Wow!

Okay.

Very strong.
(MONSTER MUMBLING)


Okay.

We're not going to hurt you.
Here we go.

I can't...

It's amazing. He won't let me.
ELIZABETH: Okay.

Okay. (GRUNTING)

Hey, get up.

Okay, okay.
VICTOR: This is it.

Treat him like a mama. Like a mama.

Yeah. Yeah.
(SUCKLING)

ELIZABETH: Okay, you can do it.

Here we go.


Good, good. Yeah.

Yeah.

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

VICTOR: Oh, my God.


Oh! Oh.

(WHEELS RATTLING)

DR. MARCUS: Yes, I know the mechanics.

That doesn't explain
how you finally did it.

VICTOR: I don't know, Dr. Marcus.

Quite honestly, I'm quite overwhelmed
by the immensity of it all.

Oh, come on, Victor. Don't be so coy.
I'm not being coy.

I want to know what the breakthrough was.

Well, it must have been something
quite wonderful. Brilliant.

But this is something far too important...
VICTOR: Simple.

...for you not to share
with the whole team, Victor.

Now, I already noticed
that some applications are out of control.

And what I was thinking was that maybe...

VICTOR:
So what? It just means he'll heal faster.

DR. MARCUS: Not necessarily.
Uncontrolled cell division...

VICTOR:
I'm not interested in your analysis.

He's going to be healthier, stronger,
far, far more resilient.

Okay.

(MONSTER SCREAMING)

VICTOR: Administer the sedative.

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

(GASPING AND SOBBING)

Yes.


(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

ELIZABETH: Oh!
(MUMBLING SLEEPILY)

Look at you.

Well.

It's okay.


There you go. Good.

Yeah?

That's good.

Very good.

Okay, so...

Mmm. Yum, yum.

Okay?

Open your mouth.

Like this. Ah...

Ah...

Ah.
Now.

Ah.

ELIZABETH: Okay.

Ah... Mmm.

Yum, yum.

Okay?

Ready? Ah...

Ah...

Good. That's it.



Okay.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Do you like that? You want it?

Why don't you have that?
(WHIMPERING)

Mama.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

DR. MARCUS: Peekaboo.

Good.

And back.

Brilliant.

Whoa!
Oh! (CHUCKLING)

Good boy.
That's a good catch.

Oh! (GROANS)
(LAUGHING)

Fuck!
DR. MARCUS: Here. You okay?

Yes.

It's okay. You didn't hurt me.
It's fine. It's okay.

Oh! (CHUCKLES)

Okay. You can let go now.


Let go. Good boy. Good boy.

(DR. MARCUS SIGHING)

Yeah, I can see that, too.

We're going to have to do a biopsy.

(MONSTER GRUNTING)

ELIZABETH: Okay.

Okay.

Ready?

That's it. That's it.

(MONSTER WHIMPERING)

I got it.

Yeah. Good.

Good. Good.

(MACHINE WHIRRING)

(BREATHING RAPIDLY)


Oh, no.

(BEEPING INTENSIFIES)




(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

(BEEPING SLOWS DOWN)

I don't want to talk about it right now.

ELIZABETH: I'm sorry.

VICTOR: This is not what I intended.

He can hear you.

He doesn't understand.
Yes, he does.

Mom.

ELIZABETH: Look.

Dad.

They're just sounds. Crude sounds.

Babies make them
and we ascribe meaning into them.

ELIZABETH: Don't kid yourself.

Dad.
ELIZABETH: Don't justify.

He's a conscious entity.

We can't just put him down.

VICTOR: If we accept that he is conscious,

then the concept of
prolonging his agony is unacceptable.

We can't...
I can't have anything to do with this.

I can't. It's...

It'd be murder. I can't do it. I can't.

Murder?

Murder.

What was that?

He was never born. He does not exist.

Look at him, Victor.

Murder.

(ELIZABETH SHUSHING)

(MONSTER MOANS)

Do you think that he's in pain, Victor?


I don't know.

ELIZABETH: Are you in pain?

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(ELIZABETH GRUNTS)

(DOOR OPENING)


(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)
(GASPS)

Okay.

It's okay. You're going to go home now.

I can't find a goddamn vein.

The pain is going to go away.


Come on, Dr. Marcus.
Wait a second.

Now then, what have we got here?

That's all right. Leave it.
DR. MARCUS: All right.

ELIZABETH: You're doing really good.

Okay.

(YELPING)
ELIZABETH: It's okay. It's okay.


DR. MARCUS: No, not yet.

Now.
ELIZABETH: Okay.

Come on, Dr. Marcus.

(MONSTER WHIMPERING)

She is gonna fit.
ELIZABETH: That's it.

You did it.
VICTOR: Okay.

You did it. This is good medicine.

Good. Good.

Good.
ELIZABETH: Rest, baby.

(MACHINE POWERING UP)

Close your eyes. Just go to sleep.
VICTOR: Start it.

ELIZABETH: Close your eyes.

(BEEPING)
(ELIZABETH SHUSHING)


That's good medicine.
Just relax and go to sleep.

Go to sleep.

VICTOR: Very good.

And go.

(VICTOR EXHALES)


You ready?

Uh-huh.

Yeah.
VICTOR: Go.

One, two, three, four, five.
(HISSING CONTINUES)



Oh, my God.
I'll do the rest. Hang on.

ELIZABETH: Okay. Okay. Please!
DR. MARCUS: Clear out.


(ELIZABETH GRUNTS)

ELIZABETH: Oh, my God.


Okay.

ELIZABETH: (SOBBING) Please, stop.

(SCREAMING)
Stop! Do something!

DR. MARCUS: I'm trying.


(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

Yeah, fine.


DR. MARCUS: Wait, wait.

VICTOR: Wait.

That's it.


(VICTOR GRUNTING)

(MONSTER CHOKING)


VICTOR: You checked his pulse?
DR. MARCUS: Yeah, he's good.

(WHEELS RATTLING)

DR. PRETORIOUS: Oh.

See? Victor fucked up.

I'll say.

DR. MARCUS: Yeah. You can see
the cell replication issues.

And I think the circuitry issues as well.

Maybe next time he'll listen.

DR. MARCUS:
I want you there more. Seriously.

You know I want to be there.

DR. MARCUS: Here we go. All right.

DR. PRETORIOUS: Hold on a second.

You got him?


Hey, give me a scalpel.
There's something wonderful going on.

These eyes, look at them.

Each one took six months to print.

Billions of microlayers.

I'm keeping these. Give me the scalpel.

DR. PRETORIOUS: Scalpel.


DR. PRETORIOUS: Wait, wait, wait.

Let me section the cranium.

That way you'll have
easier access to the eyeballs.

Good idea. Yes.

(SAW WHIRRING)

(DR. MARCUS GROANING)

Get off.


DR. PRETORIOUS:
Get the fuck off him! Fuck off!



Okay. All right.

No, no. That's dangerous.

That's... It's not a toy.
(SAW WHIRRING)

No, no, no.

No, no, no. Put it down.
Put that down. Put it down.

(MONSTER LAUGHS)

No, no. You don't want to do this.

No. I'm a doctor.
I can help you. Trust me.

No, no. Stop! Help!


Stop! Stop!

You are magnificent.

You have the strength of 10 men.

You are the future, my child.

MONSTER:
Here I lay, resting from my fatigue.

Until I felt tormented
by hunger and thirst.

This roused me
from my nearly dormant state.

I staked my thirst at the brook.

And then, lying down,
was overcome by sleep.

(OWL HOOTING)

It was dark when I awoke.

I felt cold also.

And half frightened, as it were,
instinctively, finding myself so desolate.

I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

I began to distinguish my sensations
from each other.

I gradually saw plainly
the clear stream that supplied me with drink.

And the trees,
they shaded me with their foliage.

(RODENT SQUEAKING)

I began also to observe with greater
accuracy the forms that surrounded me.

And to perceive the boundaries
of the radiant roof of the light

which canopied me.

One day, when I was pressed by cold

I found a fire
which had been left by someone.

I was overcome with delight
at the warmth I experienced from it.

In my joy, I thrust my hand
into the live embers,

but quickly drew it out again
with a cry of pain.

How strange, I thought.

That the same cause
should produce such opposite effects.

(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

Hey, Tom. You see that?

Oh, yeah. Oh.

Come on.

Puppy's so cute.

At any rate, I had no means

MONSTER: The strange system
of human society was explained to me.

I saw the division of property

of immense wealth and squalid poverty,

of rank, descent, and noble blood.

Hey, Monster.

MONSTER: A man might be respected
with only one of these advantages.

I hope you're checking out them ladies.

MONSTER: But without either, he was
considered as a vagabond and a slave,

doomed to waste his powers
for the profits of the chosen few.

(WOMEN LAUGHING)

And what was I?

Of my creation and creator,
I was absolutely ignorant.

But I knew that I possessed no money,
no friends, no kind of property.

I was, besides, endued with a figure
hideously deformed and loathsome.

in which I distinguished nothing.

Okay, well, I ain't giving no mercy fuck.

Who was I? What was I?

You don't have that kind of money, Eddie.

MONSTER: Whence did I come?

What was my destination?

Monster, is that shit all over your body?

When did you last take a bath?

Wanda, Wanda, all you got to do is take him
to a room and scrub him down.

WANDA:
A room? You got money for that, too?

I'll tell you what. I've got $100.

And that includes room and everything.

Sorry, honey...

But I can't.

I knew you were a bum,
but I thought you were a man.

You don't even look human.

Love.

I will personally cover the hotel room.
I'll refund the money, okay?

Love.

Get the fuck off me! Stay away from me!

Get... Stop. Stop!

Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off me!


No!

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

(BONES CRACKING)


No. No. No.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

EDDIE: What's going on in there?

Lay it off!

Hey, Wanda, are you all right?

What's the problem?
(NECK CRACKS)

(BANGING ON DOOR)

Monster?

Monster!

Hey, yo!

(BANGING CONTINUES)

Open up the damn door!
Open up the damn door!

Damn it!

Wanda?

What's happening, huh?

Wanda?

Monster, how come
you didn't open the door?


I hear you. I hear you.

Wanda?

Eddie. Eddie.

EDDIE: What did you do?

Move. Move.

Are you fucking nuts?

You weren't supposed to do that to her.


You weren't supposed to hurt her!
(SCREAMS)

You weren't supposed to hurt her.
Mannish boy!

Are you a man or are you an animal?

You fucking animal!


(BONE CRACKS)

MONSTER: Eddie.

Eddie. Love.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Eddie. Love.
(GASPING)


(SIREN WAILING)



Eddie!

Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings

who, pardoning my outward form,
would love me for the qualities in my heart.

I cannot believe
that I'm the same creature

whose thoughts were once
filled with beauty and love.

(SIRENS APPROACHING)

(GLASS SHATTERS)

AUTOMATED VOICE: Starting route
to 26800 Mulholland Highway.

Tum left onto West 7th Street.

Hey!



AUTOMATED VOICE: In 400 feet,

Stop. Stop right there.
AUTOMATED VOICE: In 500 feet,

(GROANS)

What the fuck?

(BANKS CHUCKLES)

How the fuck? What the fuck?


Fuck you!

Fuck you, freak show! Fuck yourself!

Shoot! You don't even
have the balls to shoot me.

Shoot me!


(GUN FIRING)

MONSTER: The fallen angel
becomes a malignant devil.

Yet even that enemy of God and man had
friends and associates in his desolation.

AUTOMATED VOICE: Proceed to the route.

MONSTER: I am alone.

AUTOMATED VOICE: In 9.8 miles, keep right

If I cannot inspire love,

I will cause fear.

(TRAIN PASSING)

You have reached your destination.

(MONSTER GASPS)

(ELIZABETH HUMMING SOFTLY)

VICTOR:
I don't know what's wrong with that guy.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

(VICTOR CHUCKLING)

Sit on the bed.

Now here comes Dr. Feelgood.

(ELIZABETH LAUGHING)

VICTOR: I love you so much.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

(SLOW FOOTSTEPS)

Oh, what's happened?

Don't hurt him.

VICTOR: No!

No! No!


Let him go. Let him go.
MONSTER: Mine!

Why?



You said you did not know me.

I ugly.

VICTOR: Stop!

No.
VICTOR: Stop. Leave her.

ELIZABETH: No.

It's okay.

It's okay, Adam.

I'm sorry.

Adam?
ELIZABETH: Yes.

Your name is Adam.

(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)

(MACHINE WHIRRING)

See? That's how we made you.

And we'll make you again.
No.

Oh, no, yes.

Yes.

And this time you'll be beautiful.

Beautiful.

Oh.

You make me

ugly.

Why?

I don't know. It was a mistake.

The cells didn't replicate correctly,

and God only knows
what turned you into such a vicious beast.

ELIZABETH: Victor.

He is not me.

Not me.

He is...

Other.

He is exactly like you.
No.

I am

I.

Yes.

And you will be you again.

My boy, I understand your unhappiness.

I understand your pain.

And I can make it go away.

You will close your eyes
and you will sleep.

And when you wake up,

you'll be just fine.

He is dead?

He's nothing but clay.

But we can all breathe life into him.

You see, that is the secret
that God is so jealous of.

The formula for life.

And I, me, Dr. Frankenstein,

discovered it,

and I will do it again.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(MACHINE BEEPING)

MONSTER: No!

I am!


I am.

I am.

I am. I am.

I am.

You.

You made me.

You

hate me.

No.

I'm alone.

I'm

alone.



I'll decapitate him
and then incinerate his head.

Get off.
No.

Move.
I can't.

Don't be ridiculous.

(ELIZABETH GRUNTS)




No. Oh.

Oh, my God. Oh, no.


(BIRDS CHIRPING)

(VICTOR SOBS)

(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)

MONSTER: I shall collect my funeral pile
and consume to ashes this miserable frame.

That its remains may afford no light
to any curious and unhallowed wretch

who would create such another
as I have been.

She is dead, who called me into being.

When I shall be no more,

the very remembrance of us both
will speedily vanish.

I will no longer see the sun nor stars,

or feel the winds play upon my cheeks.

I shall ascend
my funeral pile triumphantly

and exalt in the agony
of the torturing flames.

The light of that conflagration
will fade away.

My ashes will be swept into the sea
by the winds.

My spirit will sleep in peace.

Or if it thinks,
it will not surely think thus.

Farewell.

I am Adam!
