[helicopter blades whirring]

It's shaping up to be
a beautiful day here

in the City of Angels,

where Republican presidential
candidate Patricia Lonsdale

makes a quick and somewhat
less serious campaign stop

to dedicate the opening
of a recreation center

for disadvantaged youth
in the Venice area.

This mark's the governor's
first trip to California.

# #

Due to an increased threat level,

the governor's visit will be
marked by heightened security.

Lonsdale's controversial plan
to clamp down on port security

and the importation of illegal goods
has sparked heated debate

even among her own supporters.

Detractors have called
her stance reckless

and warn of potentially dire
economic consequences

should she be elected.

Lonsdale has recounted that America
needs a strong leader

who is willing to make tough decisions.

reporting in Venice, California.

[people cheering]

So did you see the game last night?

Game?

More like a massacre.

Hate to be the poor guy
who had his money on Atlanta.

Don't worry, John.

I haven't welshed on a bet yet.


Hey, where's your body armor?

It's too hot.

Stupid.
All clear.

Copy.

We're moving.

[cheers and applause]

Ladies and gentlemen,

please welcome
the Republican candidate for President,

Governor Patricia Lonsdale.

Welcome.

Please.

[cheers and applause]

We will offer these kids a choice,

an alternative
to a life behind bars.

With your support,
I promise an unprecedented war on crime.

Now it's on to Washington,
and let's win this thing.

[cheers and applause]

I'm gonna count on your vote.

Okay, thank you, thank you.



Let's go, let's go, this way!


[people shouting]

Come on!

The alley, it's clear.


Get down.

Hey, don't worry.

Everything's gonna be all right.

Thanks.

But I think it's your friend down there
that needs your help.

Ridley, stay with the governor.

But you can't leave him out there.


Ridley, if you're not gonna
do something, I will.

Hey, stop it.

If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead already.

They're trying to draw us out.

Look, if we leave him out there,

he's a dead man,
and you know it.

Can you live with that?


Okay.

Whatever happens,
you stay put, okay?


19, 20, and you're out, my friend.



Hey, Boyd.
Ridley.

Leave me, man.
I'm finished.

I'm not leaving you,
'cause you still owe me money.

Shut up.

I'm saving your life here.



And I had the impression
I was dealing with the best.

Seems like you need a refresher course.

Now tell me,

what's the first rule of a bodyguard?

Fuck you.

Wrong answer.

Tell me again.

What's the first rule
of a bodyguard?

Never leave the client alone.

You remember that next time.





[jumping rap music]

You sure this the place?

This is it.

Lovely.

You can do better than that.

Keep the left up.

Don't drop it.

Keep it up.

Come on, put something behind
those punches.

Don't stop moving.

Don't stop moving.

The minute you stop...

Is the moment you die.

Hey, hey.

What are you doing down here?

Huh?

How long's it been, two years?

Oh, try three.

So why didn't you
ever stop by,

pick up the phone or something?

I was beginning to think maybe
you didn't like me anymore.

Oh, it's just like-
I wanted to,

but you know how it is.

Yeah.

You remember Ozu?

Sure.
Hi, Ozu.

He just stepped up
as my right-hand man

ever since your extended
leave of absence.

Well, well,
guess it's true what they say.

Those who can, do.

Those who can't
wind up in shit holes like this.

Still haven't lost your razor-sharp wit,
Ozu, have you?

Looks like you're really
coming up in the world, Ridley.

Guess this is what happens
when you lose your edge.

Ozu.

Wait in the car.

Sorry about that.

I don't know how you do it, Graver.

Huh.

Yes, he's still pissed
about the whole-you know.

I'm sure you haven't come
all the way down here to talk about this.

No, it's not.

I've got a potential client, John,

big government witness.

I need the best for this job.

I don't do this anymore.

This client specifically
asked for you,

knows that you're the best
in the business.

I'm not in the business.

You're part of the package.

Without you, I lose the account.

All right, fine.

I'm in way over my head here, okay?

So call this what you want,
a personal favor,

a professional courtesy, whatever.

Just do this one for me, John.

Look, when I walked away
from this three years ago,

it was for keeps.

You don't mean that.

I know you.

You weren't there.

You didn't have to watch her die.

Take a good look at yourself.

You don't belong here.

You're better than this.

No, I'm not.

I'm through with it.


You always were
one stubborn son of a bitch.

Anyway, in case you change your mind.

I won't.

Nice card.

Thank you.

Don't stop.

Come on.

Where are you going?

Salvitti called in sick today.

You're joking, right?

No, I'm not.

So you'd rather spend your time
with a bunch of gangbangers

than with me.

Honey, you don't understand.

No, I understand.

I understand all right.

I understand that John Ridley died
in the alley that day,

because the man who came back

isn't the man I fell in love with
five years ago.

I don't know who you are anymore.

You're like a stranger to me.

When you come back,
don't expect to find me here.

Okay.

John, you need
to work this out for yourself.

I will.

John Ridley.

I'm looking for Graver.

Training ground.

Thanks.

[explosions and gunfire]

Be one step ahead of them at all times.



Ouch.

Well, well.

Seems we have a genuine celebrity
joining us today.

Let's all give a warm welcome
to John Ridley.

They don't make them
like this anymore:

washed-out fools who can't keep
their clients alive.

That's something this man
knows all about.

Isn't that right?

You know, Ozu, if looks could kill,
I would be half dead.

Go to hell.

Been there;
done that.

Ozu!

You have a class to teach, don't you?

To be continued, Ridley.

I didn't think I would be
seeing you again

for quite some time, John.

Does that job offer still stand?

What changed your mind?

Let's just say I'm ready again.

Well, I can't tell you how good it is

to have you back on board, John.

Okay then.

What say we go meet the client?

Sounds like a plan.

Tell me, John, how's your Spanish?

Probably a little rusty.

Come on.

[gunshots and explosions]

So tell me again,
why are we in Spain?

It's not just Spain, John.

It's Barcelona.

Wow, somebody pinch me.

You gonna answer my question?

Part of our deal with the client.

Speaking of which...

"Lee Maxwell."

This is all you got, no photos?

That's it.

Feds are playing this one
close to the vest.

All we know is he's
a high-price contractor,

international circuit,
strictly freelance.

So how did they finally get him?

They didn't.

A few weeks ago, Maxwell waltzes
into the American embassy here,

turns himself in.

Says he's ready
to name names, dates,

the works.

Just like that?

Just like that.

So why Barcelona?

One of the conditions
for his testimony

was that he be kept here
until his court date.

Look, all I know is,
he testifies in three days.

Your job is to keep him alive that long.

Oh, and one other thing.

Part of the deal for his testimony

was that you be brought in
as his personal bodyguard.

Oh, yeah.

Almost forgot.

Got a little present for you.

Wow, more surprises?

Your guns.

Don't get any crazy ideas
about actually using it.

This gets better and better.

Maxwell has flipped.

Obviously, this poses a grave threat
to the organization.

So exactly what does
Maxwell have on us?

Everything.

One of our inside sources

tells me he's cut a deal
with the U.S. government,

and he's scheduled to testify
before a grand jury in three days.

We can't allow that to happen.

This matter must be dealt with swiftly

and with the utmost urgency.

Lareina.

How are things progressing
on your end?

The wheels are in motion.

We should have closure
within 24 hours.

I hope so, for all our sakes.

It'll be clean, no loose ends.

What about this new security guy
they brought in?

Our source on the inside assures us
he won't be a problem.

I'm counting on it.

Now if there's nothing further,

I'm sure we all have
other matters to attend to.

Thank you, gentlemen.

Wait a minute.

You're putting the fate
of our entire operation

in the hands of this broad?

I take it you don't approve.

No, sir, of course not.

Since you see fit
to question my choice...

The one on the steps.


Sorry about your man.

Thank you, gentlemen.

<i>Bon dia, senyor.</i>

Hi.

Well, this is it.

Well, they seem
to take good care of Mr. Maxwell.

Oh, yeah.

He made sure of that.

Excuse me, sir.

May I have a word with you?
Is there a problem?

No, no, no.

Well, there is Mr. Maxwell's,
or rather, should I say

the bill of Mr. Maxwell.


Lobster, caviar, oysters,
and two cases of Cava Reserve.

Never thought a killer could be
such a prima donna.

They tailor, shoemaker, valet,
and in-room masseur, sir,

that will go on another bill.

If I could just have your signature?

Sorry, you've got the wrong guy.

Uncle Sam's picking up this one.

Send him the bill.

Morning.

He's with me.

[stirring opera music]

Aames.

So, Graver, this him?

Agent Franklin Aames.

John Ridley.

Hi.

For the record,
I think this is bullshit.

There is no way just one man's
gonna cover this guy.

I don't care how good you are.

Nice to meet you too.

Excuse me.

Mr. Maxwell.

I really hope you like this music.

He hasn't stopped
playing this shit since he got here.

Talking about me again
behind my back, Franklin?

Now, that's not very polite.

And you haven't even
introduced me to our new guest.

I'm gonna have to take this up
with your superiors.

I'm sorry, Mr. Maxwell.

Your, uh-
your bodyguard is here.

Oh.

Excellent.


Let me prepare myself
for the big moment.

Holy shit.

You mother... fucker.

Let's all chill the hell out.

Okay?

[beautiful choral music]

Well, that was exciting, huh?

Wasn't it?


Well, I think I'm gonna go clean up.


Look, I'm sorry it had
to go down this way,

but my hands were tied.

I promised Maxwell
I wouldn't say anything.

You've got every right in the world
to want to kill him.

I don't blame you.

But face it.

That's not gonna happen, not now,
not with the feds involved.

He knows all the names and faces
of the criminal underworld,

not to mention the present government
who have used his services for years.

Look, I don't care
what I have to do

or who I have to go through.

This guy is a dead man.

Understand?

I have no problem with that.

Excuse me?

You're absolutely right.

The son of a bitch deserves to die.

But not just yet.

All you have to do is keep him alive
for three more days.

Three days,

till he testifies.

After that, frankly,

nobody's gonna give a good goddamn
what happens to him.

Think about it, John.

You finally got a chance
to even the score.

I bet you lie awake at night
just thinking about

what you'd like to do to him.

Well, now's your chance.

But you got to decide now.

You don't take this job,

you'll never see
Maxwell again, ever.

They'll bury him so deep,
even a psychic won't be able to find him.

Just think,

three days from now,
he's all yours.

Plus, you get a nice fat paycheck
on top of it.

It's win-win all the way around.

I don't get it.

Why me?

What does he want with me?

Who knows how his sick mind works?

Just play along.

Babysit his sorry ass for three days.

Then...

So what's it gonna be, John?

I need an answer.

Everything secure?

Yeah, no thanks to your boy.

Ridley, a word of advice.

Now, that is government property
we got in there.

In other words,
his ass belongs to Uncle Sam.

You got me?

Now, I'm gonna be right outside.

If I hear you try anything,

I'll be through that door faster
than you can speed-dial your mother.

Do you understand me?

Yeah, I just didn't think
a tough guy like you

would have a soft spot
for a piece of shit like Maxwell.

I don't.

I'm just doing my job.

I suggest you do yours.

So you're ready to do this?

Yeah, let's get this
dog and pony show on the road.

Just try not to let him get to you.

Okay?

Sure.

Our field offices
are a couple of blocks away.

It's a private line.

Don't hesitate to use it.

What's the matter?

You don't trust me anymore?


Just protecting my investment.

Remember, three days.

They say crime doesn't pay.

Ridley.

It's good to see you again.

But where are my manners, right?

Let me offer you something.

Would you like something to drink,
a little local beer?

Some wine?

A little scotch maybe?

You like that?

Oh, wait.

Am I bad?


Am I bad?

You can't drink, right?

That's right, no drinking on the job.

It dulls your reflexes.

Yeah.


Come on, you know,
you got to relax, Ridley.

You're way too uptight.

Maybe you can't drink, but I can.

So how about
you share one with me, no?

Cheers.

Mm, it's nice.

Uh, something to eat maybe,
like a little surf and turf,

a little paella?

I could have the room service
set it up for you.

Here we go,
some nice Cuban cigars.

How about it?

Cuban, just for you.

Fuck it.

They'll kill you anyway, those things.


Stop with the silent treatment,
Ridley, huh?

You and I,
we have a lot of catching up to do.

Nothing?

That's it?

Well, how about some music?

Here, a little Brahms, huh?

Stravinsky,

Vivaldi?

Vivaldi is powerful.

It's like the planets, the moon, stars.

No passion?

You're gonna like this.

[uplifting strings music]

# #

That's nice.

Feel the passion.


# #

[music stops]

I prefer hip-hop.

Don't push it, Ridley.

Don't push it.

So, Ridley, you're not serious
about this hip-hop stuff?

Shut up.

Pardon me?

I didn't catch that.

I said shut up.

Got that?

My God, it speaks.

What a breakthrough.

Listen, asshole,
I'm only gonna say this once.

Just go over there,
fix yourself another drink,

and shut the fuck up.



[phone beeping]

You have three seconds
to hang up the phone.

Okay.

I've had enough of this game.

Let's get it over with right now,
all right?

'Cause that's what you want anyway,
so here's your chance.

Go ahead.
Don't tempt me.

You think you can wait
three whole days

before you kill me, huh, Ridley?

Huh?

Let's stop prolonging
the inevitable, huh?

Come on, let's do it right now.

I'm standing right in front of you,
'cause I'm the guy.

I'm the guy who ruined your life,

who killed your client,
who blew her away.

Come on, Ridley.
Let's do it.


[glass smashing]

What the hell is going on?

Just having
a little discussion here, right?

Yeah.

I'll be in my bathroom.

What are you,
in the third grade or something?

Grow up already.

Graver said you're a pro.

Maybe you ought to start acting like one.

Yeah, that guy just knows
how to push my buttons.

I hear that.

Truth be told, he had me
jumping through a few hoops too.

I got to admit,

I came very close
to punching him out a couple of times,

but come on.

There is a line.

Ridley, suck it up.

Bite the bullet,
and when this is all over and done,

you go take a vacation and drink heavily.

What the fuck?

He took the fire escape.

He's gone.

Check the hotel.

All teams, I want an immediate
room-to-room sweep of all floors.

Elvis has left the building.

I repeat, Elvis has left
the damn building.

[tires squealing]

<i>Capullo!</i>

[horn honks]

Excuse me.

Sorry.

Hola?

Catherine?

<i>Quien es?</i>

It's me.

What do you want?

Listen, I know it's been some time,
but I need to speak with you.

What?

You thought you could
just call me up out of the blue

and I'd welcome you with open arms?

You know how I feel about you,

about what you do,
about everything.

So why are you calling me?

Listen, people change.

No.

You'll never change.

I-
listen, let me just explain.

First rule of the bodyguard,
never leave the client.

Give me the phone.

Give me the fucking phone.

You weren't thinking of leaving

without at least saying good-bye,
were you?

Mr. Maxwell-

I wasn't running.

I told you I had to make a phone call.

Do me a favor.

Lend me your cuffs.

Come on,
you got to be kidding me.

I'm not.

All right, Ridley, come on.

The joke's over, all right?

Take these off.

Why don't you pour me one of those?

Who was that girl?

None of your business.

Come on, can't you
pour me a drink, all right?

A drink?

Yeah.

Why didn't you say so?

Now you just sit there
and shut your mouth,

or I tape it shut.

You're a real class act, Ridley.

A real class act.

So, Ridley,

this bodyguard thing, I mean,
why do you do it?

I mean, I could never understand
why someone would take a bullet

meant for somebody else.

I mean, is it the money?

'Cause I don't get it.

You could never understand.

Well, let me take
a wild guess, all right?

Is it some nonsense about integrity

and duty and honor?

Maybe.

Yeah.

Sounds good, but I don't buy it.

I guess this is what separates
someone like me from someone like you.

Really?

And what exactly is someone like me?

From where I'm standing,
you are the scum of the Earth.

Why, 'cause I kill people
for a living?

Yeah, for starters.

<i>La porta se esta tancando.</i>

It's the way of the world, Ridley.

I didn't create it.

I'm just a little piece of the machinery.

Besides, it's all business.

If I didn't do it,
somebody else would.

That's supposed to make it right?

No.

It just makes it the way it is.

Hold it.

Where's the regular guy?

Called in sick.

Flu or something.

[electronic beep]

Whoa, so on top of being
a stone-cold killer,

you're also a pervert.

Nice.

That's not the way it is, Ridley.

What's the matter?

You don't think I'm capable
of doing anything good?

The only thing you're capable of
is pain, misery, and death.

You know what?

When you're dead and buried,
nobody's gonna give a shit.

Nobody's gonna care one bit.

Got any keys or coins?

No.


What's this?

Sorry, forgot.

Just got it done last week.

Ouch.

That's got to hurt.

Not as much as this.

[muffled gunshots]

You know why I picked you
to be my bodyguard, Ridley?

Tell me.

Who better to guard me than the man
who wants to kill me the most?

You got to love the irony, huh?


[knocking at door]

Yes?

Room service.

[muffled gunshots]

[distant crashing]


Get me out of these.


Fuck you.

Fuck me?


Let me guess.

They sent you here to dispatch me?

Would that be a fair assumption?

[gun clicking]


[tires squealing]

What the hell was that
standing out in the open shit?

They teach you that in assassin school?

I wanted to see how good
you really are.

Look, if anyone's gonna kill you,
it's gonna be me.

Got that?

Stop the car.

What?

I just said stop the car.

You can take a leak
at the next gas station.

This is no joke.

Stop the car now.
Forget it.

If you feel like getting out,
be my guest.

If you insist.

[tires screeching]

[loud crashing]

Maxwell.

Damn!

[doorbell buzzing]

Catherine.

What are you doing here?

Look at you.

You're a woman now.

Well, I'm not a child anymore.

I make my own decisions now.

It's my life,
and you're not a part of it.

I just want you to give me a chance
to make it up to you.

Too late for that.

You show up after all these years
and decide to play the loving father?

Look, things are different now.

Oh, really?

So you've given up killing for a living?

I'm gonna turn myself in.

I am.

I promise you,
it's gonna be different now.

It's not gonna be like it was.

Hey, Houdini, let's go.

I'll make this short and sweet.

I don't ever want to see you again, okay?

So take your trained gorilla here,

and get out of my life.

Who is Miss PMS?

Huh?

Let's go.

[phone rings]

Ridley.

Yeah, it's me.
We got hit hard.

They wiped out the entire suite.

Christ.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

What about-

Don't worry.

He's still in one piece for the moment.

Okay.

I'm gonna get you to a safe house.

Where are you now?

Somewhere in the Eixample Esquerra

from the looks of it.

It's your call, John.

Just tell me how you want to work this.

Okay, remember my friend
Rogelio's place,

the one I used
on the Scagnetti case?

Yeah, sure.

The nightclub over in Barri Gótic, right?

That's the one.

After dark, okay?

We'll be there.

Don't worry.

You'll be sucking down brandy
and caviar again in no time.

You assured me
this little problem of ours

would be dealt with,

and now you tell me
this seemingly simple task

has been somehow-
how did you put it?

Fucked up?

I can't afford incompetence.

Our window is rapidly closing.

If you cannot get the job done,

maybe it's time
I find someone who can.

If you'll excuse me
for saying so, Mr. Tolkin,

you'll recall it was your man,

I mean,
woman who was in charge-

If you're referring to Lareina,
she would never disappoint me.

You gave me your personal guarantee

that this bodyguard would be
of no consequence.

Just a minor setback, sir.

But in a short while,
all your troubles will be over.

I can assure you.

Your assurances don't mean
very much right now, Graver.

Just get the job done.

I don't want to have
this conversation with you again.

Understood?

Yes.

We wouldn't have been in this mess
if you'd brought me in earlier.

Just send over a half dozen
of your best men.

Here's the address.

You're making a mistake.

Let me go alone.

I'll have everything cleaned up
nice and tidy.

Just do what I tell you.

Oh, oh, oh.

Don't fight the feeling.

Oh, oh, oh.

[jumping hip-hop music]

I'm here for Rogelio.

It's amazing what passes
for entertainment these days.

[jumping hip-hop music]


Holy shit, man.
Holy fucking shit.

I can't believe this,
right in front of me.

Bigger-than-life Ridley,
John fucking Ridley.

Hey, Rogelio, nice to see you.

Man, haven't seen you in,
like, forever.

Well, didn't catch the name, buddy.

Maxwell.

Any friend of Johnny's
is a friend of mine.

That's great.

Now, I know you didn't come
to Barcelona

just to see my ugly mug again.

No.
So what's up?

In some kind of trouble?
Need my help?

Whatever you need, you got it.

Just say it, Johnny.

Come on, what's the 411?
What's the dealio?

Break it down for me.

Hey, take it down a notch, okay?

We just need a place
to hold up for a while.

We're kind of hot right now.

You mean you're back
in the game?

Well, all-freaking-right.

Just like the good old days,
huh, Johnny?

Just like in the good old days.

Anything you need.

Just let me know.

I can give you 100%, okay?

For right now,
we just need some food.

We're hungry, right?

Yeah, food.

Say no more;
say no more.

I'm on it.

You guys make yourselves at home.

Kick back, relax, chill.

Be back in a flash.

Okay.

Hey, you want some girls with that?

No, thanks.

I take it this gentleman here
is a friend of yours.

Well, he's a very good friend of mine.

I guess it's something
you wouldn't understand.

Yeah, well, I never had
much use for friends, you know.

Oh, how come
that doesn't surprise me?


Yeah.

Rogelio and I, we did a few
campaigns together.

Rogelio was a mercenary?

You've got to be kidding me.

That guy?

He was the best demolition man
in the business.

He was really talented
in blowing stuff up.

But deep down in his heart,
he always wanted to be a rock star.

Guess this is as close as he got.

Yeah, tell him it's called
self-denial, you know?

All right?

Tell him to get over it.

You really are a heartless bastard,
aren't you?

Yeah, well, it comes
with the territory.

You know, in my line of work,
that's the way it is.

That's bullshit.


Gustav.

Bon appetite.

Get a room, okay?

Yeah, bon appetite.

[pulsing dance music]

So who's this guy?

Do you really want to know?

Ahh.

Let me get this straight.

You mean to tell me
that guy sitting in there,

right in my office,
is the same son of a bitch

that killed your last client?

Yeah.

And almost fucking ruined
your entire life?

Yes.

And you're his bodyguard?

Yes.

Excuse me for asking,

but have you completely
lost your fucking mind?

I think that's a distinct possibility,
yeah.

I can't believe this.

How can you be so calm about it?

How come you're not in there right now
laying the smack down on his ass?

Rogelio, that's a long story.

I don't get it, man.

I just don't get it.

I mean, call me crazy,
but if it was me,

two seconds after that motherfucker

walked back into my life,
he'd be dead.

Look, all I used to think about
was killing this guy.

I must have murdered him
a thousand times in my sleep.

But now...


I just want this job to be over with.

And I want to keep on
with the rest of my life.

[pulsing dance music]


[people screaming]



[glass shattering]

Oh, we're back in the business.

[gun clicking]

Fuck.

Sorry, big boy.

But this one's all mine.

You, my friend,

need to get in touch with your,
shall we say,

feminine side.


Are you okay?

Whoa, man.

Shooting that bitch
was a real tattoo moment.

A what?

You know, something that will
stay with you forever.


That's funny.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I did not know this was
going to happen.

Oh, don't worry about it.

I just wish I could have
helped you out more.

I think you did just fine, bro.

I owe you one.

A big one.

Yeah.

What, are you waiting
for an invitation?

Move over.

I drive.

I didn't know boosting cars
was part of your repertoire.

Let's go.

[tires squealing]

Graver sold you out.

Fuck, no way.

Who else knew we were gonna
be there in the first place?

No way Graver would set me up.

That's not possible.

Come on, Ridley.

One thing you got to learn,
in this business,

anything is possible.

Shit, Catherine.

Catherine, the girl from earlier?

Yeah, we got to go back and get her.

What, the one that despises you?

No way.
Forget it.

Listen, I got no time to sit here
and argue with you, okay?

I'm not gonna explain it to you.

Her life's in danger.

We got to go back and get her.

Listen, asshole,
I am sick and tired of playing games.

So who is that girl?

She's my daughter.

I don't believe this.

Listen, if I'm a target,
then so is she.

We got to go back and get her
before they do.

What makes you think
they even know about her?

'Cause there's only one person
who knows about her.

And that one person is Graver.

Rogelio was right.

I'm losing it.

All right, we'll go back to the city.

<i>Café?</i>

<i>Y quieres algo mas?</i>

<i>No? Vale.</i>

Catherine.

What the hell are you doing here?

Listen to me.

We've got no time to explain.

You have to come with us, okay?

It's not safe here.

You must be joking.

I'm not going anywhere with you.

Catherine, listen-

Get your goddamn hands off me.

<i>Catherine, Te estan molestando</i>
<i>esos hombres?</i>

<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>estos caballeros ya se iban.</i>

Look, you have every right
in the world to hate me, all right?

But it's not safe here.

You have to come with us now.


[people screaming]


What are you gonna do
to get us out of here?

I'm working on it.
Relax.

Well, do something.


Stay down;
don't move.

I'll be back.


Where's your bodyguard now,
Maxwell?

Where the hell is he?

[engine revving]

You need an invitation?


You know, really,
I know you're not as dumb as you look.

When you gonna get it
through your thick head

that Graver sold you out?

When are you gonna accept it,

and what are you gonna do
about it?

I still say that's bullshit.

Graver would never do that to me.

You know, you better talk straight,

or you're gonna end up
as dead as Lonsdale.

Say that again.

Say that again,
and see what happens.

You heard me, huh?

You want to see what happens?

I'm gonna show you what happens.

Stop it.
What the fuck are you doing?

It doesn't help anything.

You know what?

She's right.

No more talk.

Huh, how's that?

Huh, huh?
What are you gonna-


What happened?

I didn't hit you that hard.

It's not you.

You still hit like a pussy.

What's wrong?


I've got to take my pills.

Ahh.

Saw about a dozen doctors.

They all said the same thing.

They said it's terminal,
you know.

So either way I'm dead,

so it doesn't matter.

I guess my body's
turning against me.

I can't blame it though.

How long?

I don't know,
two, three months tops.

It seems like I'm getting paid back

for all the horrible things I did,
you know.

Payback's a bitch, huh, Ridley?

So this is what it's all about.

That's why you're testifying.

No.

Seems like I want
to show some people

that I still got some good in me.

You have your mother's eyes.

You know that?

Her hair.

You're the spitting image of her.

I just want you to know
that leaving you both

was the hardest thing I ever did.

Then why did you?

Catherine, because I knew
as long as I did what I did,

both of you would always be in danger.

I wouldn't have that.

Why you didn't just quit then?

You can't quit, Catherine.

First time you do what I do, that's it.

You're in it for life.

I just want you to know
that I never stopped loving your mother.

And I never stopped loving you.

Okay?

Come on.

I think it's better we get out of here.

Wait, wait, stop the car.

Stop the car.

Where in God's name are we?

This is Rogelio's country house.

It used to be like my second home.

We'll be safe here.

[knocking at door]

Johnny boy.


Since you're here,
you must be still in trouble, right?

Nice, huh?

Come on, guys.

Get in here already.

You've got to be kidding.

You see?

This is my grandma, my grandfather.

When I travel the world,
I buy things.

I got this in China.

I got this in Japan.

Well, actually, this is fake.

And that horse over there,

it was a real horse
that I bought in Japan.

Come on, come on.

So who is your decorator,
the Marquis de Sade?

Well, you know what they say.

A man's home is his castle.

Don't believe I've had the pleasure.

Rogelio, please meet Catherine.

Welcome to Camelot, my lady.

<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

Thanks.

So where is the dungeon?

Down the hall and to the left.

Beautiful and sarcastic:
I like.

And of course
you remember Lee, huh?

Of course.

Yeah, charmed, I'm sure.

Ozzie used to own it back in the '70s.

Got to maintain that
rock and roll image, you know?

Hey, Rogelio, listen.

What happened in the club-

Oh, forget about it.

You know, I was getting bored
with that joint anyway.

Probably would have ended up
torching it myself

for the insurance money.

So what's the plan, man?

Well, I don't know.

I make it up as I go along.

Well, looks like you won't be
going anywhere for a while.

Drink, anyone?

Drink?
Yeah.

How about bring the whole bottle?

Wow.

Hey, mind if I come in?

No.

Who's that?

My father.

He always taught me to be strong,

always pushed me to try harder,
to do better, to be the best.


He wanted to toughen me up
for the real world.

But one day, he got sick:
lymphoma.

And I had to watch this man who always
seemed like Superman to me

waste away to nothing.

And there was nothing
I could do about it.

Is he the reason you became
a bodyguard?


Maybe.

Maybe I was just tired of being
on the wrong side.

Yeah.

Why do you still keep this thing?

As a reminder,

as a reminder of a mistake
I will never make again.

So, Maxwell, tell me.

Why did you let me live?

Was it another one
of your noble gestures

of wanting to do something good
before you die?

Maybe.

You see, in my line of work,

you get used to pulling
the trigger for someone else.

It's so anonymous.

Faces don't mean anything.

After while, you know,
you get a little dead inside.

So in that alleyway
when I saw you leave your client,

protect your friend,

as stupid as I thought that was,

there was something
very honorable in that.

Like I said before,

I can never understand how you guys
take a bullet for somebody else.

I could never do that.

But what you did-
yeah.

I just thought maybe you should
die in a better place

than some alleyway.

What?

Now I'm supposed to be
thankful for this?

I'm just telling you the way it is.

Listen, I got an idea
how we could make things right.

What do you mean?

You call Graver.

You tell him I'm ready
to surrender,

but tell him only
to him personally.

If you're right about Graver,
you're setting yourself up.

You're gonna be a dead man.

Yeah.

Don't you love the irony?

Make the call.

Shit.

I guess the old saying is true.

If you want something done right,

you've got to do it yourself.

How very true.

And since you seem incapable
of following through on your promises,

the task has fallen to me.

I've given Mr. Tolkin my word

that this matter would be resolved
once and for all.

All right.

Let's finish this, shall we?

You, get the men.

You're gonna love this.

[machinery whirring]

Just a few souvenirs
from some of our previous ops.

Always thought this stuff
might come in handy some day.

Nice, huh?

Let's see what we got here.

It's a-

Heckler & Koch PSG1,
650 millimeter heavy-duty barrel,

four grooves, right-hand twist,

Hendsoldt scope with illumination,

target-type pistol grip.

Nice.

That's what I was gonna say.

Let's go to work.

[electronic beeping]

Hey.

Just thought you might
need something to warm you up.

It gets pretty chilly out here.

Yeah.

I take it you spend a lot
of time at fountains.

Well, I do some of my best
thinking at fountains.

That's what I was doing;
thinking.

I don't know.

I feel all mixed up.

That man in there-

That man?

You mean your father?

Yeah, my father.

I still have problems saying that.

You can't change the past,
but you can change the way you feel.

It's never too late for this.

Maybe it's time to forgive
and move on.

And what about you?

Can you forgive him?


I don't know.

Hey.

Take this one here.

Thanks.

It's nice and warm.

They're coming.

How many?

Enough to go around.

Rogelio, take her upstairs.

Get her safe.

Go ahead.

I got this from Rogelio.

I can never understand these things.

They're uncomfortable as hell.

But I think it's time
you got a new one, right?

Thank you.

Come on.

Let's go welcome them.

Let's get this over with quickly.

Let me handle this.

It's personal.

Good to see you again, John.

So where is he?

He's dead.

Dead?

Ah.

Guess he pissed me off
one too many times.

I had to kill him.

Why don't I believe you, John?


You tell me.

I know you too well.

That's not your style.

You always did have
a warped sense of honor.

Now let's stop playing games.

Where the hell is he?

First tell me why.

I think you owe me that much.

For old time's sake, huh?

Sure, why not?

I did it for the money,

a lot of money.

That's what it's all about
in the end, isn't it?

Wave enough green
under someone's nose,

and they're liable to do anything.

Like sell out a friend.

You were the perfect scapegoat, John.

Who better to pin Maxwell's death on
than the man whose life he ruined?

Nobody would ever question it.

And I'd be home free.

But you had to play the hero.

Anyway, I'd love to stay here
and chat all night,

but I have a deadline to meet,
you understand.

I promise I'll make it quick,
for old time's sake.

Now, where is he?

What if I don't feel like telling you?

Face it, John.

The odds aren't in your favor.

Well, maybe we can help
even things up.

[electronic beep]






Chase him down.






Catherine, give me another clip.

Get my pills.

Stop, Ridley.

No more heroics.

You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

I'm going to leave you
with more than just a scar.


Oh, damn, damn.


Oh, damn.

Mr. Maxwell.

I'm afraid your services
will no longer be required.


It's okay.

It's okay.

I had to do it.
I know.

I had to.

[both grunting]

[both screaming]

[metallic scraping]

[metal clanging]



[both grunting]

[distant gunfire]


Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm all right.
You sure?

Okay.
Let's go.

Maxwell.

You've been one colossal pain
in my ass, Maxwell.

Leave her alone.

She knows nothing.

True.

But it's not a good idea
to leave any witnesses.

You of all people should know that.

You want me, Ridley?

You got to go through him.

You prepared to do that?

Yeah.



Say hello to the devil.


Why did you do it?

You shot me.

I don't believe it.

How'd you know?

I didn't.


[siren wailing]

Hey, Aames.

Glad that you could make it in time.

Why the hell didn't you call me sooner?

This guy hasn't been giving you
any trouble, has he?

You have no idea.

Didn't we have fun tonight, huh?


Just like the good old days, Johnny.

Like the good old days.

We got two hours to get you
on a flight back to the States.

I hope you're ready.

I'm ready as I'll ever be.

Thanks, Rogelio.

You take care, Johnny.

So you think
you're gonna be all right?

I guess.

[people talking at once]

Over here, please, sir.

How did it go in there?

It felt good to get it off my chest.

I'll tell you that.

Bye-bye, Victor.

Have a nice life.

You ready to meet your new world?

Bring it on.

Let's go.

[people talking at once]

Shit.

Good-bye, Ridley.



Hey, how do I look, huh?

I got to look good
for the cameras, right?

You look fine, Daddy,

just fine.

Please don't try to talk.

Now we're even.

[dramatic music]
