Always in my dream,

l'm clinging to a branch,

Knowing full well that
death inevitably awaits me.

The fear of dying without ever having
Known love was greater than the fear

of death itself l Know now l was not alone
in the horror of this darKness.

So, too, was the fear
of Anna Karenina.

lt was then that a drop of honey
sweet enough to divert my eyes

from the cruel truth
came into my llfe.

She was the princess

EKaterina ScherbatsKy.

Thank you, Constantine Dmitrich.

l didn´t know that
you were in Moscow.

l arrived yesterday.

l mean, today.

l was going
to come to see you.

l didn´t know
you could skate so well.

l´m awful.

But the rumor is that

you are a superlative skater.

Oh, years ago. lt used to be
my passion.

Skate with me.

Must be dull in the country
in the winter.

Not at all. l´m very busy.

Mama said that you live
like a barbarian out there

and wear peasant clothes.

There´s a lot more to it
than you think.

lt´s very scientific.

Are you here for long?

l don´t know.
That depends on you.

Mama´s waiting for me.

-May l call on you?
-We´re at home on Thursday as usual.

Today, then.

Au revoir!

You said you wanted my advice
on a delicate matter?

Yes, Stiva.

l think l´m in love...

but l´m plain and too old.

She may be able to love me as a friend,
but l would´ve to be handsome

and more remarkable to make
her love me as a husband.

Who is the lucky girl?

Can´t you guess?

l´d be your brother-in-law.

Kitty.

Do you think there´s
any possibility?

Oh, why shouldn´t
there be?

For God´s sake, be absolutely
frank with me.

l´ll tell you something.

My wife Dolly is a most
wonderful woman.

-She can see through people.
-What do you mean?

Well, l mean, not only that
she likes you,

but she says Kitty is certain
to be your wife.

They are sisters,
after all.

She... she said that?

Constantine Dmitrich Levin.

Oh, God.

He´s come early.

l don´t think l´ve come
at the right time.

-l´m too early.
-Oh, no.

This is what l wanted...

to find you alone.

The guests should be
here in a moment.

l told you that l didn´t know
whether l would be here long...

that it depended on you.

l meant...

l meant do say...

be my wife.

l cannot be.

Forgive me.

lt was not meant to be.

Why, Constantine Dmitrich.

Do stay. Have some tea.

Ah, Constantine Dmitrich.

Back in our corrupt Babylon.

Well, is Babylon reformed,
or have you been corrupted?

That you remembered my words so well.
They must have made an impression on you.

Of course. l note down
everything you say.

What´s the matter with Levin today?Why
doesn´t he launch into one of his tirades?

Please.

Constantine Dmitrich.

How´s it that at home in our village of
Kaluga, the peasants have spent their all

on drink and now pay us nothing?

What is the meaning of that?

You´re always so full of praise
for peasants.

Do let me introduce you.

Constantine Dmitrich Levin,

Count Alexei Kirillovich
VronsKy.

Constantine Dmitrich despises
and hates town and us townspeople.

Do you live in the country
all year round?

l should think it must be
rather dull in winter.

Not at all if one has work
to do. Besides, you can´t...

-be dull in your own company.
-l like the country.

l'd be bored to tears.

One simply can't live without
sophisticated conversation.

Countess Nordston was telling me

about a demonstration of table
rapping and spiritualism she attended.

Oh, that would be fascinating.

l´ve never seen anything
supernatural.

Do you believe in spirits,
Constantine Dmitrich?

Why´d you ask me that? You know
perfectly well what my answer will be.

But l want to hear you opinion.

My opinion´s that table rapping
merely proves

that the so-called educated classes
are no better than the peasants.

They, too, believe in the evil eyes
and spirits.

But l´ve witnessed it myself.

But don´t you think
there´s something in it?

lf we admit to the existence
of electricity

of which we know nothing,

Why shouldn´t there exist
some newforces yet unknown to us?

Because with electricity when
you rub wool and resin together,

you invariably produce a
recognizable phenomenon.

But with this hocus-pocus...

Suppose we try now.

Do let us try,
Princess Kitty.

Ah, Stiva.

Who are you meeting?

My mother.

-You were missed last night.
-Where?

The Chateau des Fleurs,
of course.

My God, there was this wonderful
little girl doing the cancan.

l went home. l felt in such an agreeable
frame of mind when l left the Scherbatskys´,

l didn´t want to go
anywhere else.

´´By the mark of your steed, l can
tell your fine breed

and a young man
in love by his eyes.´´

-And who are you meeting?
-l´ve come to meet a pretty woman.

-Oh, indeed.
-Shame on you.

My sister Anna.

Karenin´s wife?

Yes, well, you must know her.

l don´t think so. l know Karenin
by sight and by repute.

You´ve a very illustrious brother-in-law.
Very high up in the Ministry.

Yes, a remarkable man.

But not our kind.

Like your friend Levin. l met him last
night, an insufferable fellow.

Oh, you don´t appreciate my Levin.

But yesterday there was a reason
for him being out of sorts.

You don´t mean he, uh...

Levin has been in love with
Kitty for so long,

and l feel so very sorry
for him.

So that´s it.

Excuse me.

You got my telegram?

How are you?Well?

-Have a good journey, mama?
-Anna Arkadyevna!

Can´t youfind your brother?

Stiva, here!

She´s very charming, isn´t she?

Poor girl. Her husband refuses
to travel with her. He says he´s too busy.

Well, Countess, you´ve met
your son, l´ve met my brother.

Pardon me for not recognizing you,
but l don´t think we´ve ever met before.

Anna Arkadyevna

has a little boy of 8, Seriozha.

They´ve never been
parted before, and she´s fretting

at having left him behind. Really,
Anna, you can´t expect never to leave him.

Well, good-bye, countess.

Good-bye, my dear.

Very charming.

Horrible.

He´s dead.

lt is a bad omen.

Nonsense. You´ve come.

That is the chief thing.

You cannot imagine how much
l´m counting on you.

Stiva, l know you´re to blame.
Don´t deny it.

9 years... my children...

all to be thrown away
because of a...

momentary lapse.

True. lt was not nice

that she was the
children´s governess.

What can l do?

Drop me at your house and
go bacK to the court.

ls this Grisha?

How he´s grown!

How happy and well
you look.

He told me.

He met me at
the station.

Grisha, go and find Tanya.

of course she´s young,

and she´s pretty.

My youth and looks are gone,

taken by him and
his children.

l hate him.

l don´t want to speak up
for him,

but what is the best thing to do
in this dreadful situation, Dolly?

Stiva is ashamed.

But he made love to her.

l don´t excuse him, but...

that´s how it is.

Anna's mission to heal the rift
in her brother's family

was not unliKe my own desire
to restore the ties with my brother,

so desperate were we both
to feel love.

Good evening.

Excuse me. ls Nikolai Levin here?

There is a gentleman here,
Nikolai Dmitrich.

Nikolai.

Kostya.

What is it?
What do you want?

l don´t want anything.

l came to see you.

You´re my brother.

This woman is my life´s
companion.

Maria Nikolayevna.

l took her out of a brothel.

But anyone who wants
to know me must respect her, too.

All right, then, Masha,

supper for 3, then.

with vodka and wine.

Your brother drinks too much.

Take no notice of her.
She´s a whore.

You are a gentleman.

Nikolai, don´t drink.

Leave me a...
Leave me alone.

l´ll beat you.

How about supper, then?

Have a drink.

Tell me how you do it.

Why aren´t you married yet?

Oh, no luck.

l think there must be something
about me that repels people.

Why?

For me, everything´s over.

For you...

Come back with me...

to the country.

For the sake of your health.

No. Too much to do.
l´ve become a communist.

Nikolai, the police.

They´ll persecute me like they do
anyone who´s not a scoundrel.

Here.

You want to fell
magnanimous...

feel righteous.

l´ll let you have that
satisfaction.

Don´ t think too badly
of me, Kostya.

Mama, please.

Princess Kitty, may l ask you
for the quadrille?

l´m sorry, but l´m promised
to count Vronsky,

but you may have
the second quadrille.

An honor, princess.

The master of ceremonies
can never be refused.

lt was nice of you
to come in good time.

Such a bad habit to be late.

-Where may l take you?
-Madame Karenina´s over there, l think.

Will you take me to her, please?

Pardon, mesdames,
monsieurs, pardon.

You even dance into the room.

Princess Kitty´s one of my
most faithful helpers.

She adorns the ballroom and
makes the ball gay.

-May l have the pleasure?
-No. l never dance if l can help it.

Oh, but you must tonight.

Well, but if it´s impossible
not to dance, let us dance, then.

Well?

Nothing.

Princess, you are such
a delight.

ls your card free
for the mazurka?

l should withdraw.

This is turning out
absurdly.

Will you stay to supper? l have a
wonderful cotillion in mind.

No, l won´t stay. l´ve danced
more at this ball

than l have in a whole winter
in Petersburg.

These few brief moments
intoxicated Anna

liKe a light pouring into
the darK room that was her llfe.

We´ve stopped, mistress.

l want a breath of air.

What are you
doing here?

You know that l have come
to be where you are.

l cannot help myself.

Forgive me if what
l say offends you.

You shouldn´t say that.

And l beg you, if you´re a gentleman,
to forget this as l willforget it.

Not one word...

not one gesture of yours...

Shall l...

could l ever forget.

Stop it.

Yes, as you see, here is
your devoted husband

burning with impatience
to see you.

ls Seriozha all right?

ls that all the reward
l get for my ardor?

Yes, he´s quite all right.

Did you have
a good night?

Excellent. Thank you.

Ah, we´ve met before, l believe.
Count Vronsky.

You set off with the mother and return
with the son. Back from furlough, l presume.

So, my dear, how was Moscow?

l hope l may have the honor
of calling on you.

Delighted. We´re at home
on Mondays.

l told you it was mama!
l knew!

Oh, my pet.

Gifts from Tanya
and Grisha.

Tanya can read now, you know?
She´s even teaching Grisha.

ls she nicer than me?

To me you´re nicer than anyone
else in the world.

l know l am.

On the whole, then, your
visit was a success?

l cannot see how a man
like that can be exonerated,

even if he is your brother.

But l´m glad it all ended satisfactorily
and that you´re back again.

You wouldn´t believe how
irksome it is to dine alone.

l missed you, too.

Time for bed.

Betsy,

-l´m beginning to lose hope.
-Whatever hope could you have?

None.

Excuse me. l´m afraid
l´ve become ridiculous.

Oh, my dear, you're in
no danger of that.

A man pursuing a young girl
might be ridiculous,

but a man in love
with a married woman,

that has something fine
and grand about it.

lt could never be ridiculous.
Next you'll be telling me

that young girls should be
virtuous, women chaste,

men virile, and children should be
brought up

to pay their debts and earn their
bread and all the other nonsense.

But look at them...

Karenin,

that awful Lydia lvanovna.

So old-fashioned,

so stuffy.
They surround her.

When l am old and ugly,

l´ll become like them.

For a beautiful woman
like Anna, it is too soon

for her spirit to be crushed
by such boredom.

We must rescue her

before it is too late.

Come to my house
on Saturday.

ls it true that the younger Vlassiev
girl is going to marry Topov?

Yes, they say it´s
quite settled.

l am surprised at her parents.
l heard it was a love match.

A love match?What antediluvian
ideas you have.

Who talks of love nowadays?

That foolish old custom´s
not left us yet.

The only happy marriages are
marriages of convenience

where both parties have sown
their wild oats.

ln my young days, l was
in love with a deacon.

l didn´t know that
it did me any good.

No, but joking apart.
l believe that

before one can know
what love really is,

one must have a fall
and pick oneself up again.

Even after marriage?

lt´s never too late.

l´ve been wanting to tell you that you
behaved badly, very badly, indeed.

You think l don´t know
that l behaved badly?

But who made me?

How can you say that?

You know why.

That only shows
you have no heart.

l came here tonight knowing
that l would meet you

to make it perfectly clear
this must stop.

You make me feel as if
l was guilty of something.

What do you
want me to do?

l want you to go
to Moscow and...

You don´t want that.

Then do this for me.

Never utter
those words again.

And let us
be good friends.

Friends
we shall never be.

You know that.

There is only one way
we can be happy.

l have nothing left
but you. Remember that.

Nothing matters anymore...

Not even life...

for one moment
of happiness like this.

Happiness?

Don´t ever
speak of it again.

l have to warn you.

Warn me?
What about?

That by thoughtlessness and
indiscretion, you may cause yourself

to be talked about
in society.

You´re beginning
to attract attention.

l´m sure
they´re only rumors.

You are always like that.

You don´t like me to be dull,
and then you don´t like it

when l go out
and enjoy myself.

Stop it. You Know
l can´t stand it.

And l would like to know
what all this is about.

Your feelings are the affair
of your own conscience,

but l am duty-bound to point out
to you your duties.

Our lives have been joined
not by man but by God.

Only a crime
can sever that union.

A crime of that nature brings
its own heavy punishment.

l don´t understand
a thing you are saying.

And besides,
l´m desperately sleepy.

Anna, for God´s sake, don´t
speak like that. Perhaps l am mistaken.

But believe me, what l say
l say as much for my sake as for yours.

l am your husband,
and l love you, but if

-there are the slightest grounds...
-l have nothing to say.

lt is really bedtime.

Here it is.

Stupid miss
with the right barrel.

Stiva?

When´s Kitty
getting married?

She isn´t thinking
about marriage.

She´s very ill.

The doctors
have sent her abroad.

Where´s Vronsky now?

He´s in Petersburg.

He left shortly after you did. And
he´s not been in Moscow once since then.

Do you know, Kostya,

l´ll be frank with you.
lt was your own fault.

You took fright at the sight of your rival.
Why didn´t youfight it out?

Kitty was never
serious about him.

She was just attracted
by his good looks.

l tell you candidly

that when she returns
from her cure,

she´ll be going to Yergushovo
for some quiet country life.

And that´s not too far
from here, Kostya, is it?

l don´t know
if you know,

but l don´t care.
l´ll tell you.

l did make an offer...

but l was rejected.

Now Kitty´s nothing more than a
painful, humiliating memory. lt´s over.

l was hanging down
that darK well,

but the one thing
l held onto

was worK.

l clutched it and clung to it
with all my might.

once l lost my temper
with a bailiff

and in a fit of anger tooK a scythe
and began mowing.

lt calmed me,

So l resolved
to mow with them... all day long.

As l mowed,

l lost all count of time.

l had no idea whether
it was late or early.

A change came about my worK,
which gave me intense satisfaction.

When l forgot what l was doing
and mowed without effort,

My line was almost
as smooth and good as Titus'.

More and more often now
came those moments of oblivion.

When it was not my arms
which swung the scythe,

the scythe seemed to mow
by itself.

Some externalforce
seemed to propel me on,

as though by magic...

the worK did itself
regularly and carefully.

These were the most
blessed moments.

lt was she.

lt was Kitty...

on her way to Yergushovo.

Quiet, sweet.

Loot at her face, mama.

So spirited and yet so gentle.
l feel she could almost speak.

A fine horse.

Everybody´s betting on you.
Not entirely for the right reasons.

What are you
implying, mama?

Don´t be coy with me.

You must know how you´ve
become the center of gossip.

An affair
in the highest society

puts a finishing touch to
a brilliant young man.

Lord knows
l shouldn´t preach, but there are those

who are becoming displeased with you,
Alexei. l want you to break it off.

l will not have anyone cast doubt
on the honor of my...

Her honor is nonexistent.
So is yours.

l´ve been told you´ve refused
a post in Moscow.

A promotion.

Mother, l would ask you
respectfully not to pry.

You only get one chance
at a career.

Why throw it all away
on some passion?

A brilliant, worldly liaison
l would approve of,

but not this desperate...

Oh, if my love were some ordinary,

vulgar society intrigue,

you would leave me alone.

You have not the remotest
idea what l feel.

l find the lying, the deceit,
the scheming intolerable.

Then give her up.

l wasn´t expecting you.

Gracious, what cold hands.

You startled me.

l´m waiting for Seriozha. l...he went out
for a walk. They´ll come back this way.

Forgive me. l couldn´t go the day
without seeing you.

But shouldn´t you be
preparing for the race?

What were you
thinking of?

Please tell me.

Anna, what´s the matter?
l can see that something´s wrong.

l´m going to have your baby.

Tell him everything
and leave him.

-Oh, my son.
-You must be free of him!

Free to become
your mistress?

When can
l see you?When?

Tonight. 1:00.

Well, l must be
at the races.

Do you like horse racing?

Good-bye.

Seriozha, there is
no need to be so rude.

Papa told me always
to be truthful.

Save your strength
for the finish.

Fine.

Watch out for the water jump.

Are you riding today?

Here we are!

There is so much splendors here.
one´s eyes are dazzled.

l will be staying the night.

l am sure you are glad
we can be together.

We can go
if you like.

l again
offer you my arm

if you want
to be going.

l´m obliged to tell you
that your behavior...

What about my behavior?

Be careful.

The despair you were unable to hide
when one of the riders fell.

Possibly l am mistaken.

in that case,
l beg your pardon.

l listen to you,
but l´m thinking of him.

l love him
and l´m his mistress.

l can´t endure you,

and l´m desperately unhappy.

You can do
what you like with me.

ls everything all right ma´am?

What time is it?

Almost midnight ma´am.

l've told my husband everything. l must
see you. Come at once to the house.

Count Vronsky!

Ah, General Serpuhovsky!

Brooding on your misfortune?
lt won´t do at all.

Come on. Let´s go and
have something to drink.

l heard news of your promotion. l was
delighted and not a bit surprised.

l heard you refused an important
post. Men like you are wanted.

-By whom?
-By Russia.

Russia needs men.

-The communists are gathering force.
-There´re no such things as communists.

Scheming people always have to invent
some dangerous, noxious party.

-lt´s an old trick.
-Oh, well, l won´t fight you.

Shall we go outside? l heard Therese
is going to perform as lady Eve.

l like to see that kind of show
with a gypsy girl on my knee.

-l´m afraid l´ve an assignation.
-Assignation? No, you don´t Vronsky, old boy.

Karenin arrived this afternoon.
Saw him at the races.

l wouldn´t keep
that appointment.

l took the liberty of ordering you
some brandy and cucumbers.

Drink the brandy.

Oh, and, this came for you.

Bad news?

She´s told him
everything.

l must go to her.

What do you want?!

Sit down! l have something
to say to you.

l know l... l´ve done wrong
and l´m...

Whatever your conduct may have been,
l don´t consider myself justified

in severing the ties through which a
higher power has bound us.

l shall ignore it

as long as the world knows nothing of it,
as long as my name is not disgraced.

And therefore l simply
warn you that our relations

must remain as they´ve always been.

-l can´t be your wife while l...
-So you see nothing wrong with

your infidelity yet refuse to perform
the same duties for your husband!

What do you want
from me?

l want you to never
see him again!

l want you to be
a dutiful wife!

l can´t change
what has happened.

Well, understand this.

l´ll go to Moscow. l will not return
to this house again.

l´ll divorce you
on the grounds of adultery.

My son will go
to my sister´s.

No. You must leave me Seriozha.
You don´t love him.

l´ve even lost
affection for my son

because he is associated
with my loathing for you!

But all the same,
l shall take him.

You are a whore.
You have no legal rights.

Alexei Alexandrovitch,
leave me Seriozha.

You know l can´t live
without him.

lf you´ll conduct yourself
so that neither society

nor the servants can find
anything to say against you,

you can enjoy all the privileges
of a respectable wife

without fulfilling
the duties of one.

and you may
keep your son.
