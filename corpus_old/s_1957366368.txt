the variable scope for this?

No. I've got a lock
on vector and trajectory.

You ever hear that saying,
"Listen to your elders"?

Big phrase, especially here in Japan.

So you're an elder now?

"Elder" doesn't necessarily mean old.
It just means older.

As in smarter, wiser.

But hey, I'm serious.
We blow this chance, it's seven years...

Seven years of hard work down the drain.

Ah, so you do listen to me.

Vâ€¦

I haven't missed once in 12 years.

Not gonna miss.

All right. Let's dance.

Oh, one last thing.

See? And you say
I only think about the work.

[bottle fizzes]


{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[in English] No.

Hold on. There's a kid here.

Please reconfirm.

<i>It was wrong.</i>

[thunder rumbles]
[rain pattering]

Nobody knew she'd be there.

We had one rule, V.

One simple rule. No kids.

I know.

I mean, this ain't your first rodeo.

You know there's collateral damage.
You know that.

I can't shake it.

Trust me, I've tried.

Almost to the head of the snake.

Look, I promised
I'd finish the job, and I will.

And then I'm out.

I want a life, V.

You know, I never had one.

A real, regular life.

What does that mean?

I mean, whatâ€¦ Family? Kids?

Picket fence? Dogs? Suburbs?
I don't know.

Something like that.

Two trips to Walmart, you'll be back.

You haven't even touched your Merlot.

It's Margaux.

I'm sorry, that was a total pick-up line.

Fuck it. I mean, listen.

The worst way
to start a conversation is a "Hey."

It's boring, it's dull. It's for horses.

So anything but that.

I'm Stephen.

Hey.

What's your name?
Kate.

Kate. I'm Varrick.

<i>I'm your handler now.</i>

That makes me your mother,
your father, your best friend,

<i>and your therapist.</i>

Left. That all you got? Left.

Good.

[footsteps echoing]


You've been out almost a day.

[whispers in Japanese]

[in English] Have you had any recent
exposure to radioactive materials?

No.

The reason I ask is you appear to be
suffering from accelerated ARS.

Acute radiation syndrome.

Lethal.

Caused by subjection
to potent radiation inâ€¦

Extremely short amount of time.

Which substance?

We looked for the usuals.

Iodine-131, thallium, but uhâ€¦

It appears to be more specific.

Polonium-210?

204.

[inhales sharply]

We'll take the Margaux to go.

Please do not try toâ€¦

How much time do I have?

A day, maybe.

But we will make it painless for you.

Shit.

It's possible that...

Five liters of blood in the body,

Gun's on your femoral. You do the math.

I need something to keep me going.

I want stimulants.

These. Load them in the shots, go.

Give me five.

Come on.
Okay.

I don't have all the time in the world.

What are you trying to do?

[woman speaking Japanese on radio]

Shibuya-ku Sendagaya.

[Stephen speaking indistinctly]

[woman] â€¦take a shower.
[Stephen] We should just have fun!

[Stephen] It's the last night. Come on!
I know.

But I still have stuff to do.

Oh, my God! [gasps]
[Stephen groaning]

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[in English] Why'd you poison me?

What are you talking about? Poison?


They told me it was just a roofie,
so they could lift the room.

Who? Who told you?

Even if I knew, I'd be dead if I tell you.

Aw, she'll be dead if you don't.
Wait.

Don't.

[Stephen sighs]

Sato.

Kazuo Sato. He manages a Yakuza club.

Which clan?

Kijima.

Fuck, it's a Kijima clan.


Sato said that
if he did this one last thing,

that he would set us free.

We could actually start over now.

A different life.

Please.

[spits, coughs]

These might fit you.

Can I get you something?

Anything?

Boom Boom Lemon?

You got any?

Oh, umâ€¦

No, sorry.

I'm Kanako.

And it seems we're the same.

Collateral damage.

I'm Kate.

And they're gonna know I was here.

Who?

Everyone.

[tense music playing]

Poisoned by who?

to figure out.

There must be some antidote.

For polonium-204?

Who was the mark, V?

Kate, you know, uhâ€¦

V?

Who was the mark?

You won't get any more
questions from me after today.

A man named Kijima.

I recognized him from Osaka.

Who is he?

Grand honcho
of the biggest family in Tokyo.

Your mark in Osaka
was Kijima's younger brother, Kentaro.

[gunshot]
[blood splatters]

for us as it's been for you, andâ€¦

[clears throat] Kijima, apparently,
who hasn't been able to let it go.

This was revenge for Osaka?

Some people have this extraordinary
attachment to their siblings,

as if genetics make a family andâ€¦

Anyway, all that honor shit,
Kijima's been on a tear against theâ€¦

[Kate sniffles]

How do I get to him?

Kijima doesn't surface.

Not after Osaka.

Last night was a very rare opportunity.

What about Sato? Kazuo Sato. Ring a bell?

I know that some of his guys hang out
at a place called the Black Lizard.

That's a start.

You Sato?

Kazuo Sato?

[in English] Who are you? What...

Did you poison me?

You don't tell me, I kill you.

I think you're lying, I kill you.

Did you poison me?

[wounded yakuza wheezing]

Yeah.

Why?
[wounded yakuza groans]

Hey!

Why'd you poison me?


{\an8}- From Kijima?
[yakuza lieutenant speaking Japanese]

[in English] Please.

Where is Kijima?

How do I get to him?

Nobody knows.


All right. Same question, same deal.
[men shouting in distance]

[in English] You killed him! He is the...
He is dead. You worry about you.

You crazy! I don't know!

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

Where is Kijima?

[Ani breathing heavily] Okay, okay, okay.

Next one goes in there.

I'm sorry.

You're gonna call Kijima for me.

What?

Kijima. Call him.

I can't. I don't have his number.

Oh, you don't have his number? Really?

Kijima, yeah, I don't have his number!

How do you reach him?
Okay, who are you?

How do you get in touch with him?

I don't know, I just call <i>ano baka </i>Renji.

{\an8}- Renji?
[speaking Japanese]

[in English]
The only person that talks to him.

Okay. Call Renji.

{\an8}- [Renji]<i> Ani?</i>

[in English] I got the kid.
If Kijima wants to see her again,

he can meet me at the center
of Murakawa marketplace in one hour.

A second more and she dies.
[Renji in English]<i> Who is this?</i>

[in English] You're crazy.

You wanna get Kijima?

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[in English] You think you canâ€¦
You can't get to him this way.

He doesn't give a shit about me.

No one does.

Come on.

{\an8}[Renji speaking Japanese]

Huh?

{\an8}[all speaking]

[sucks teeth]

[indistinct announcement over PA]

[in English] And you know,
for your information,

I haven't talked
or seen my uncle in, like, a year.

Shit.

Ew, what the fuck?
Oh, my God, what is wrong with you?

Sit down.

I said, sit down!

Yeah, no way. You're all gross and sick.

And you know what?

Fuck you, cancer bitch.

[Japanese pop song playing]


Me, too. Come on.


{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[Kate groans]

So many scars and blood. It's soâ€¦

It's gross, I know.

No, no, no.

I think it's awesome.

Ow!

[Kate] You better get out of here.
Wait!


Hey. Where are we going?

Stop following me. Stop.


You're useless to me now.

Did you see what just happened?

My own family wants me gone.
Where the fuck will I go?


I'll be dead before the night's over.

Hey, that makes two of us.

Why did you save me, then, huh?

You're making me regret it!

You can't abandon me.

I know Kijima killed my dad,
and he will kill me.

What did I do wrong, huh?

I haven't done anything to anybody,
but they still treat me like shit!

[gun clicks]

[all laughing]

[Ani crying] Everybody, all the time,
just throwing me around,

like I'm some piece of garbage.

Shut up!

You don't know what you're talking about.

You just yap, yap, yap.
Just "fuck this, fuck that."

You don't know anything! You're a kid!

[Kate breathing heavily]

[Kate groans]

[syringe clatters]

Medicine. Dropped it.

What's wrong with you?
[autoinjector hisses]




I'm dying.

Kijima did this, right?

Are you gonna go kill him?

You're a badass killer motherfucker.

You'll need me, you know. Likeâ€¦

Just look at you. Youâ€¦

You won't make it an hour
without my help, okay?

And I can do everything, okay?

I know who, where, when, whatever.

I can help you get him, get my uncle.
Okay.

And I'm really good
at shortcuts and maps andâ€¦

What?

I said okay.

Okay.

Umâ€¦

You can't walk around like this.

[vending machine dispenses]

{\an8}[Kate groans] Sold out.

{\an8}Boom Boom Lemon?

You know what? This is stupid. Let's go.

Yeah, clean clothes are stupid.

"Everything I should wear
should be just covered in blood."

Aw, it's so cute on you.

Come on.

You're so cool.

But you're also a Terminator, bitch.

Oh, my God.
[imitates gunshot, exclaims] "I die."

[Ani chuckles]

Seriously, we'reâ€¦

We're actually pretty much the same.

It's scary.

Who has a line into Kijima?

Only Renji. I told you.

His main advisor.

That was my dad's job.

But he got shot.

Kijima did it, I'm sure.

And Renji was there, too.

How do I find Renji?

Um, probably with his <i>aijin.</i>

His what?

His boyfriend, Jojima.

Tell me where.
Mmm.

It's this fucking cool penthouse,
top of the tower.

The entire floor is theirs.
Security?

I mean, two in the lobby, at least.

Service entrance?
Yeah.

The back, by the kitchen.

We could just shoot our ways in.

And risk Renji escaping?

No. I have to get to him
before he knows what's wrong.

We'll be fast, okay? Bang, bang! Brrap!
[imitates gunshots] "You're dead..."

Stop. Speak less, open your ears.

We're gonna distract them.

<i>You're</i> going to distract them.

How?

By being you. Just, you know, louder.

Okay, cool. Soâ€¦

Can I have a gun?

No.

Ani-chan?

{\an8}[Jojima speaking]

[gun cocks]

[Kate in English] Where's Renji?

What do you want from Renji-san?

It's not your concern.


Of course it is my concern.

Your concern is to stay whole
until I leave here.

Renji?

You may do to me what you must.

But I will not be
disclosing his whereabouts.

Shut the blinds.

Shit, there's one remote for everything.
[loud pop song starts playing]

Hey.

Come on. Come here.

No. No, stop it. Stop it! Stop!
Hey. Look at me.

[sobbing and babbling]
[shushing]

Look only at me and breathe.

[whimpers]
Breathe.

Breathe.

Okay? You're gonna live through this.

Okay?

All right? You're doing great.

Okay?

Come here.

Come here.

Hey, maybe we should
check this house, huh?

Maybe there's some, uhâ€¦

Clues?
Clues. Yeah.

[glass shards crunching underfoot]


Bingo.

Hey, I think I know where Renji is.
Yeah?

Check this out.

Cellular tracking.

{\an8}I can see exactly where Renji is
and where he will be.

{\an8}That's very good.

"Useless."

[in English] Hey, Renji.

I gotta be honest,
I'm having a rough night.

I really need to see your boss Kijima.

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

Speak English, motherfucker.

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

English, I said.


{\an8}[speaking Japanese]


{\an8}<i>Fuzakenna.</i>

[in English] Family killed my father.

Family tried to kill me.

All of you asshole hyenas
getting fat off of my dad's carcass!

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[Kate in English] Look.

Just give him to me,
and you'll live. Okay?


When he disappears like this,
he says, "To be amongst family."

I don't know what it means.

I know where he is.

[Kate panting]

Your phone.

[line ringing]


I'm gonna finish it, V.

<i>Hey, I promised you, didn't I?</i>

Kate, tell me where you are,
I'll come to you right now.

Let me help you.

<i>Don't. I'll already be dead anyway.</i>

You can find my body
near a house in Hottazaka.

<i>In the hills.</i>


Goodbye, V.

Kate?

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[in English] Does that hurt?

When you do that.

No more questions.

I don't know anything about you.

Don't need to.

Do you wanna know about me?

I know enough.

But I'm the last person
you'll get to know.

You don't wanna know me?

That's sad, Kate.

I think that's reallyâ€¦

It's sad.

My mom's a <i>gaijin,</i> too.

That's why I've never met her.

Never even seen a picture.

They won'tâ€¦ Iâ€¦

I don't know what she looks like.

She was like you, I bet.

Tall andâ€¦ pretty.

No shit from no dudes.
Just doing what she wants all the time.

Total killer babe.


[slow sentimental music playing]

[camera shutter clicking]

It's the old family house.
No one really knows about it.

Where they all grew up.

The elders and shit.

My dad, too.

Go on.

I'll finish this.

What? You'll finish it?

Hey, look at you.
You can't stand, and you can't see.

Okay? You're gonna die.

Yeah, after I kill him.

I'm here now. I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.

Why not? I go where you go.

Because you're a fucking kid.

Go be one.

I never could.

Hey, Aniâ€¦

You're young.

You have time to forget.

Be someone less angry.

Take control of your own life.

[in English] Kentaro, your brotherâ€¦

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

Renji.

[car approaching]

[in English] Hi.

Get lost.

Yeah.

You know, I thought
I had the coolest bracelets.

I realize now,
you have the coolest bracelet.

I have a gun, you know.


Your parents raised you right.

Yeah, you don't know
shit about my parents,

so just fuck off.

Well, I know it couldn't
have been easy to lose 'em.

You know,
I lost someone that I love a lot.

And you know her.

Kate?

Maybe my best friend.

And, uhâ€¦

I'm very worried about her.


I didn't know Kate had any stupid friends.

Well, she's got you, doesn't she?

But you're right.

She and I
aren't really friends, more family.

{\an8}[Kijima speaking Japanese]

[in English]
No, but Varrick, he'sâ€¦ he'sâ€¦

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[Kate gasps and chokes]

[in English] Have you ever wondered
about Kate's obsession with your family?

You mean my uncle?

Yeah, sure. Him, too.

Sorry.

I know you've been through a lot.

What do you mean?

Kate ever share with you what she did
in Osaka when she first met you?

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[gagging and struggling to breathe]

[in English] I have to finish this.

I'm dying. I have to finishâ€¦
I have to finish something.

Death is the time for the beginnings.

{\an8}[speaking Japanese]

[gun cocks]
[tense music plays]


[in English] No, no, no.

No, Ani. Ani, noâ€¦



Ani...
You killed my whole family.

Youâ€¦ You bitch!

No, please.

Shoot me if you want,
but don't get in that car, okay?

Look at me. I'm begging you.

You're stronger than I am.
You don't have to end up here...

Shut the fuck up!
I have nothing left, okay?

It's what they do.
You and me, we're collateral...

[Ani screams]



[engine starts]

[Ani sniffling]

Now what?

Nowâ€¦

You start the rest of your life.

[ominous music playing]


I know how much you must be
hurting right now, losing your parents.

<i>But it's gonna be okay.</i>

[screaming]
[Ani screaming]

[woman over radio]
<i>I repeat, take the shot.</i>

[men laughing]
[young Kate]<i> The gun was empty.</i>

It's empty!

I know.

Shoot 'em in the stomach,
they die slow, in agony.

And they know it's personal.

Let's go.

[Ani whimpering]
Breathe.

<i>Breathe.</i>

<i>let that pain overwhelm you?</i>

<i>- Control you?</i>
[groans]


Maybe you can embrace it.

<i>- And let it empower you.</i>
[gasping]

[dramatic music playing]

{\an8}[Kijima speaking Japanese]

[dramatic music continues]

[autoinjector hisses]

Renji?

[in English] What is she doing here?

She's the future. Mine at least.

Ani, sit.

You went after my girl
without my permission.

I could fucking kill you right now.

And destroy your own operation?

My issue is not with my operation.

It's with you taking it on yourself.

You ordered her termination.

"If she's leaving, I will terminate her."

Your words exactly.

"If."

I said "if."

Key word, "if."

She was coming back.

I just had to work it.

I was working it.

She would have changed her mind.

I would have changed my mind.

Polonium-204?

Fuck you!


That was always the deal, Varrick-san.

After Kentaro's death,
all eyes were on me.

I panicked.
I moved too quickly, and I'm sorry.


Yeah.

You know what? You blundered, I blundered.

Let's, uhâ€¦

Maybe we do our best
to put this behind us.

In the name of being human.

I prefer self-interest.

I trust it more.

I can't say I can trust you going forward.


Trust was not a part of the deal.

Neither is friendship.

Welcome to the Yakuza, Varrick-san.

[voice breaking]

I'd do anythingâ€¦

To undo it, to take it all back.



Be nice, right now,

who we are now.

And you know, Kate, that we areâ€¦

One that cannot accommodate dissent.

I promise you

[Ani crying]

Hey, hey.

Yeah. It's okay.

I know you.

No, no, no. [sobbing]

[slow mournful music playing]

[heartbeat slowing]

It's okay.
