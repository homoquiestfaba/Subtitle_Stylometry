I remember the first time in my life
I felt that everything would come to an end.

Contemplating Death
looking straight into his eyes.

Dragons!

They say that when we are
die, everything looks in slow motion ...

Ah, that's me. At that time
my life, I knew I was two seconds
entering into eternity ...

"Be prepared"? I do not! For
at least, not ready to die!

Now that I think, looking in
perspective, not really going to die.

But then, when I was so
young, it seemed certainly death.

Which is weird because
it all started very well.

SCOUT CAMP

1. The Scout is worthy of confidence.
2. A Scout is loyal.

3. The Scout serving and helping others
without expectation of reward or praise.

4. The Scout is friend to all and
brother to other Scouts.
5. The Scout is courteous.

6. The Scout sees in nature
God's work and that's good
to animals and plants.

7. A Scout obeys without
replication and does nothing by halves.

8. A Scout smiles and sings even in difficulties.
9. The Scout is cheap and respects the property of others.

10. A Scout is clean in 
thoughts, words, deeds
and the use of all their senses.

We were all in the Scout mobile
and the way to adventure.

I remember like it was yesterday: friendship,
camaraderie, the rivalries, the outputs
the power to eat what you want ...

I went in the car.
Camp Road.

Guys, I was thinking about making a
Court of Honor to analyze camp
once you get back. What do you think?

It would be great!

It would be nice to report that
win some specialties.

Specialties?

Yes, Logos Specialties. My brother
won one in less than two minutes.

In less than two
minutes? What did?

It was the special observer.
Reported to Synod all the evidence
I had to find and voila!

In one out? Your brother
is a lucky guy!

Yes, and so won the special observer.
Your brother is a grosso.

Belonged to the Scout Group # 909,
Dragons of Fire Patrol.

Before it was called only
"Dragons" but wanted York
it was something more spectacular ...

Hey York, you know what the
record for most specialties
won in Camp?

49, and so did the Owls
Forest Camp in the past.

49 Specialties? In four days?

I know, it's amazing.

Yes, they're like 19, 20 ...
They are 7, Reggie 7.

Yes, there are 7 Specialties
per person! I knew!

You could win the "Turtle"

Hey, I have the guilt of
Too late! My mom had to
wash the car and go for a haircut.

And that took three hours?

Hey, Clint, calm down, we are part of the
team, remember. I want to do
be proud of in this camp.

Kerry, it is assumed that we can not
bring electronics to camp!

Or cell phones!

"We cannot hear the
nature if they bring their cell phones! "

I did say that, but ...

I could have called my girlfriend!

I could have called my mom!

It is a call from BP,
pass me the phone.

BP? What is BP?
"Good pancakes?

Baden-Powell?

Who is Baden-Powell?

Do not know who is
Baden-Powell?

Hand me the phone. Is "Well
Prepared on the District Council.

Baden-Powell is
Founder of Scouting.

What? How come you cannot?
Sub-Sos Scoutmaster!
You cannot leave me alone now!

They will not go to the bathroom?

For what?

This is the last stop
urban by the Camp.

And during those days, only
KYBOs can use.

What are the KYBOs?

What are the KYBOs?

Reggie, my friend
do not really want to know.

When you hear, you stand up straight
all the hairs on your body,

ask your instinct to escape,

but your body will be paralyzed by
terror, almost on the verge of convulsing

your eyes turn white, 
and throat feel dry, like
if it were full of sand.

Once you log in, if you cross that
door, you know the real FEAR

because inside you know, that about
the Kybo, there's someone lurking,

waiting for the opportunity to knock
the Kybo, leaving the occupant helpless

and the Scout is screaming and crying, until
the rest of his Patrol comes to the rescue,

and cannot even
finish pooping.

Can stand if they want,
but, while this is a station
old and dusty Service,

has a comparative luxury bathroom
with which we find there.

The choice is yours.

Cute story, York!
Bathrooms Camp
cannot be so bad!

We went to Camp Rakhouta one
of the most prestigious camping sites,
respected and old on this side of the Mississippi.

The Scouts were not only
to Rakhouta lived Rakhouta.

All glory, all
spirit, any tradition.

York always told us stories
had lived at Camp Rakhouta,
now going to live our own history.

Scouts! Silence and Attention!

Novices, Scouts, Scoutmasters,

welcome to my camp.

My name is Mike and I Adler
Country Head Rakhouta.

It is a pleasure to welcome you
to be the best day of their lives.

The best days of our lives!

Before starting the activities, we will
raising of the Flag, led by Patrol
Polar Bear Ice Cream, # 44 Scout Group.

Attention Patrol Service ...

Marchen ...

Scouts ... firm ...

Patrol Service
Flags placed.

Will find
a "gift" in
Camp bathrooms?

That would be disgusting!

You're the disgusting.
You're too disgusting.

Guys, we will not get
at the Opening Ceremony.

Big deal, we will not
to die for that.

There is a ceremony either. Are performed
screams from the camp, have the Rod of Spirit
not there is a lack of respect.

And, as we are now Fire Dragons, I
I really do things well, so I have
prepared something special for our Patrol:

Red Berets.

One for each suit.

You cannot be serious! You're going to make
we use these things? Let's look
cocks! NO I get it!

I think we can still reach
Vara ceremony of the Spirit.

What is the Rod of the Spirit?

Reggie is the main
Rakhouta tradition!

White Feather is the
explained in detail.

In 1888, two American explorers,
Henry Phelps and Marcus Fisher, explored
this land, seeking new frontiers.

Fisher wrote in his diary, "After
of years of travel, we Indians
have committed a hidden place

of extraordinary beauty
where the eagles fly free
watching, guiding ...

See also constantly
big bears, walking vigilant
and protecting this land.

The Indians say they are
Protectors of the Earth Spirits.

In my life as an explorer
I have seen many beauties: The
exuberance of the tropics

imposing the Great Plains, coastal
east and west, but nothing
compares to the beauty of these lands.

These valleys have been really
blessed by God with their beauty.

My journey continues and my body must
follow, but my Spirit, will remain
forever in this land.

Rod of the Spirit that we have here
Camp is Rakhouta
same as Fisher used in his travels.

Has passed from generation
generation, and all the campers
Rakhouta and live in legend,

Eagle acquire speed and strength
Bear, as the Guardians accompanying
the Spirit of Fisher, and live in the Vara.

Live then, the Legend
Rakhouta camp with the strength
Bear, Eagle and speed.

May the spirit of
accompanying guardians.

That camp begins!

Ok guys, thanks to Reggie and
their occurrences, we arrived late.

So try to arrive at least
at the end of ceremonies to introduce
to the other patrols and make a good impression.

But, my backpack?
Let it be me, Reggie.

But, my tent?
Let it be me, Reggie

But, my toothbrush?
Reggie!

Come on, guys!
Kerry, you can download things?

Okay, I'll
load the backpacks ...

Hey!
Reggie ...

Hello, Dragons?

All right ...

They hold the record ...

Were lost, ladies?

Miss you see any around here?

We are the Fire Dragons.

Let's go.

No hard feelings, eh?
And without pants!

And our revenge, yes ...

Now I see how many do ...

Oh, God!

What you did to your sandwich?

I did it "Super Shell"

What?

Super Shell, I took
all the bread shell.

You have to eat
the shell as well.

Yes I eat,
but separately.

You're crazy.

Why not clothes to match?
I want to implement a survival technique.

This patrol will not call us "girls"
Seriously, no one will.

It seemed too hard.

Not so.
No?

Reggie, if we do not respect,
all other patrols bother us
throughout the camp!

Want to spend all these days
defending you from abusers?

No, of course not.

So just remind you,
that we do not play.

Ok, I got tired of waiting.
Let's use some fuel.

With this light.

Call it a lot.

Careful, that's dangerous!

Here comes the Scoutmaster!

Need help?
No, thanks.

How's the fire?
It will soon be ready.

In two minutes at most.
We are about to turn.

Well done. The pyramid is well armed
they put enough tinder, the fence
security Stone either.

And when you turn it on
friction will be a perfect fire.

Yes, I am sure
You can turn it on well.

However,
I would like to comment you something:

It is important that the fire is ready
cooking time, therefore, just use ...

No, Kerry, do not use matches!
We prefer to turn that way!

Oh, my God! Kerry!

You okay?

I'm fine, I am the Scoutmaster.

A tip: If you put fuel to the fire
must tell all the troops!

Dude, your eyebrows ...

Oh, well ...

Want something cool for ...

I think I better go
to find the kit ...

That was ... Incredible!

Oh, my God, they saw his face?

It seemed an alien, ha ha ha!

So what can we
found in the Provedur√≠a?

Basically, everything.

Do not think they have "everything"
Want to bet?

Wow ...

Which of these is the sharpest?

It.

He says "No, my son" ...
Sorry ...

How much are soguines?
A million dollars a meter.

Just kidding. Dime
meter. Want this?

The multipurpose saw it work?

You think?

You have tried?

I have to charge you measure it.

How is everything?

All right.
How much are these?

These are free. Replicas of the Rod
Spirit, that is kept in memory.

Incredible! Look over there!
What bombonazo!

Reggie, come here, 's hide!
Why? What happens?

What is the fire?
She is the fire!

Someone noted above
your basket workshop?

No, not yet ...

Well, it's better to be always ready!

I scored to Basket!
Me too!

From now ...

I love the Basket!

Beware, they will break these things!

What does it matter? They're free!

Ay!

Not even hit you!

But almost hit me!

Remember guys, if not
swimmers cannot perform
any aquatic activity.

Thus, not only will his Camp
boring, but will be unable
Specialty yield no water.

Now, I can see some of you
are a little worried. "No, that water
must be very cold, I freeze, bua ... "

Do not worry! At this time of year
this lake is practically a hot spring!
They add a couple of bubbles and have a jacuzzi.

My grandmother is bathed in cold waters, have no
scary! The waters are shallow and very
sun exposure, are really good!

At my signal, may enter
for the swimming.

Now begins the function.

Wait for my signal
may soon enter ...

May enter upon
exact turn signal ...

It's just a ...

Just a second ...

This trash does not work ...

Now, boys, here comes ...

Done! Water!

So much for that mess? Should
simply have said "T√≠rense!"

Hold our towels, steward.

Hey, that's not funny.

Come to the water.

These waters are warm, makes
the same speech every year.

What, you do not know how to swim?

No, but the camp is for
kids enjoy it, not me ...

Ok, whatever you want ...

Ryan, slip into the water.
No.

Do you mean? Join this group.

Do not you remember the last camp?
Yes, what is?

There were sharks in the water!
But that was in the Coast! There is nothing like that here!

But what if there?
Get in, nothing!

No.
Ryan, Get in the water!

You could put your Patrol in the water?
I have other things to do.

What is it, Dragon? You afraid
it turns off your fire?

Patrols must work together. If a
your dragons are afraid of getting wet, they will
that all the water out and do something else.

Ryan, slip into the water, I'm here!
No.

Troopers do not make your case?
What a great guide that you are!

I will not repeat it, or put all ...

Enough, Ryan, water!
NO!

Full disobedience in
your face, Dragon Guide!

Here you have something to your face!

I left the half, Dragon.
We are the Fire Dragons.
They smell like manure Dragons!

Silence and Attention!

Okay, that never happens
Fashion! How about the applause of
Watermelon for Scoutmasters?

So many seeds!

They had a good day?
Yes!

Ok, before doing the lowering, I
make them reflect on the beauties
We here at Camp Rakhouta.

Stop a moment and look around.
Look at God's creation, the magnificent sky,
stars, towering mountains, the lake ...

Year after year, many Scouts as you today
Rakhouta went through in this same land and under
this same sky, and heat of that fire.

Look, feel ... Can you feel the
Spirit? They can live the legend?

All rise, please.

Ok, now all my signal, I want to put
full force, all their heart and all your Spirit
to shout the name RAKHOUTA to the mountains.

If you want to live the legend should
fully engage should
shouted with all his might.

Ready?

My sign:

Rakhouta!

Rakhouta ... Rakhouta ... Rakhouta ...

That, Scouts, is the Spirit
of Rakhouta, who lives in these
land, and waving,

so that you too
leave your mark on history
of our camp.

Over the next few days
listen carefully, because
the Spirit could speak ...

The soul of Camp Rakhouta
also be composed of
actions from now ...

So I ask:
Shares will be worth
to be part of our Spirit?

Make sure that each of its
actions, is something worthy of emulation ...

Esfu√©rzence every day
that is the Scout Spirit.

Can sit.

Is this a joke?

Scouts cannot use the Rod
Spirit of jokes
make them happen.

They just informed me that
Rod is in place.

If it was someone from my Troop I
I will wash dishes for a year!

What happened?
Must be a joker.

If any of you know
where is the Rod of Spirit
return it immediately.

Do not let something like that ends with
the joy of our camp.

Is it good?
Yes, brown.

Who will the be taken?

Probably the Forest Owls.
Those guys do not know what is respect.

I am sure that, whoever the
is taken, will repent and return.

You'd better.

Who wants more meringue?

Not me, thanks.

Ok, Troop, I'm tired
I go to sleep. Behave yourselves,
feed the fire, good night.

Good night.

I also go to sleep.
We will have a heavy day tomorrow.

Good idea.

Yes, let's go to sleep. Come?

No, I will make the first call.

Guard?

For what?

By mosquatch not know?

What is a mosquatch?

This is how Henry
Phelps called the monster.

Monster?

Yes, it is in the final pages of his diary.
Says that's what killed Fisher.

Although, it really should not
tell you this right now ...

Yes, I prefer not to know ...
No, tell us! What happened?

Reggie sounds like
you're scared ...

Please my nothing scares me.
I've seen The Goonies on TV

That's not scary!

Sure scared! Well,
maybe the Cubs ...

But not me. Except
the type of hook ...

Whatever.

When Phelps and Fisher were to leave,
climbed to the top of that cliff ...

and Phelps told Fisher he had to go
Nevada, and again in the morning.

Why did you leave?

Because he had forgotten something.

And what he had forgotten?
Do not know.

I could not wait until the next day?
Reggie, shut up and listen to the story!

So Phelps was prepared to go ...

Fisher said goodbye, not knowing that
would be the last time I would live ...

and before he left, he gave his staff

had the same
accompanied on all journeys.

it would become
in the Rod of the Spirit.

Fisher was left to sleep
at the top of the cliff, but could not
sleep, something bothered him ...

There was something wrong with the trees in the wind
and that sound of something breaking ...

Like when you step on a branch?

It could have been that. But that
sound was too loud,
and came from one direction.

Fisher felt fear. He was alone
to fight anything.

Decided to go down the cliff. While
had found traces of Phelps.

While perceived
a strong smell of pine ....

I also smell!

That was Clint!
Very funny, Reggie!

Seriously, it smells like pine!
Yes.

So Fisher continued to decline,
looked around and saw nothing but that
persistent sound goes on around him ...

Began to flee without knowing why, and
encountered at every step, as if the trees
wanted to stop him in the forest ...

The sound was becoming
stronger and the smell of pine,
so I kept running ...

He dared not look back, but I knew
something was chasing him, could feel a
hot breath close to his neck ...

Continued to run, but the root
tripped, then turned around and saw ...

a hideous pair of red eyes
who pounced on him!

Was mosquatch!

Ha ha ha, they fell!

For you to hold my leg!?
You got me why mine?

You're a punk!
You should have seen their faces!

What was that?

Guys ...

Oh no ...

Is the mosquatch!

Run! Run!

It went really well!

What's wrong?!

Sorry, I was scared!

Guys, it's over.

Reggie, I thought do not panic.
Do not get scared.
Liar!

Want to explain how
get this?

Yes, it's mine, I found it.
Reggie, do not be silly ...

Calm down ...
No! Listen: This staff says Reggie
he found, is the Rod of the Spirit!

This is the Rod of the Spirit?

Why you got off?
Do not know ...

The gift gave the Provedur√≠a.

These were replicas,
this is true!

Did not know!

If the other patrols found out,
take us for fools!
We need to return.

Now?
Yes, right now.

But it is past midnight.
We can not wait until tomorrow?

Ok, we'll do tomorrow. Early!
I do not want anyone to know that we have a
socket on the Dragon Fire!

"You're not my father"

"You think I'm pretty?"

"May God bless everyone"

"You have my bow, my sword and my ax"

"Let my people go!"

"Black ball in the hole in the corner"

"Wingardium Leviosa"

"When the Saints come marching"

Who are you hiding, doll?
From you.

It is a hopeless case.

Scouts, firm.

Service Patrol, march.

Patrol Service
Flags placed.

Greetings, one!

Thanks, Dragon.

Where's Reggie?

Ah ... Behind you.

Guys, good job!
They showed great respect
Raising Ceremony on.

How did it go?
Eh ... well.

Somebody saw you?

Reggie, what happens?

I need your help.

Let's go.

Is everything okay?
Yes, back then.

... and when they removed the trash,
there was a squirrel, eating ...

Rod?
Garbage!

Where's the Wand?
Garbage!

It's amazing, right?
Uh, I found ten cents.
And where's the Wand?

And last night at midnight I woke up wet
and I thought I had made the pi, but was
my canteen that had been spilled ...

Where's the Wand?
Look at that butterfly! Oops, that
bird has red feathers ...

Think you've reached Knight Scout?
May be ...

Because my mom says I should learn
to handle if you want to be a full Scout, but ...
Where's the Wand?

And when I saw that kid, I thought
I was going to beat me, but ...

Did you threatened?
No, but his face was so ugly ...

Hey, do not worry
not going to spend anything.

But let's talk about that later.
Now, let's get the Rod.
I know, I know, my Patrol is my Shield.

Yes, we care for one another.

Well, here it is.

Or, I think it was around here ...

Where is it?

You put the Rod
Spirit in a tree?

Ah, yes. But no longer.

You sure this is the place?

Yes, I think so ... I was coming down
that road and I meet ...

Wait! Somebody saw you?

Yes

Who?

I do not know there were three Scouts.

Patrol what they were?

I do not know, I said it.

They saw you?

Yes, I asked if I
was hiding, I told
yes and then left.

You have to find that Rod.

Where are you going? Waiting!

We are the Owls
are the Owls,

we have a "Buhen" day
we have a "Buhen" day

I would not have ruined.
Yes, I'd ruined.

Good morning, Dragons, Always Ready!

We are the Dragons of Fire!

Raising Good, Dragons, where
believe that we are in the Army?

You have to respect national symbols.
That you did your brother? Where got?

Is burning your
Patrol Corner.

Look dwarf, do not mess with
Owls in the Forest ...

Who?

With the Forest Owls!

Who?

With the Forest Owls!

The "Buhen?

Enough.

You're lucky that
Cubs will not stick to.

Scouts Okay, welcome
for target practice.

My name is Stan Gallagher.
Leslie, stop the music.

In the next few hours, will be
MY world, where there are two rules:

1. I give the orders. 2. What I say, it is,
not to kill anyone, okay?

Unable to handle weapons if they do not pay
attention and not follow the rules,

they have been whole and do not want
return as a gruyere cheese.

Ok, the first to be made funny, receive
My Assistant Leslie a stick over his head and
immediate expulsion from the camp, right Leslie?

Absolutely!

Any questions? No, no questions
ask later. Understood?

I asked if they understood.
Yes!

Yes, why?
Yes, Lord!

Yes, Mr. Stan.
Yes, Mr. Stan.

What?
Yes, Mr. Stan.

Okay, not going to touch the rifles to
tell them to do so, nor will they shoot
until told to do so,

not going to breathe until I tell you
they do, understand? Because this is my
world, who does not obey, he dies.

Start practicing!
Roger!

Prepare ...

Aim ... Fire!

Nice shot! Shoot! Very good, continue!

What is the problem?

Recharge ... Ceasefire!

Rod returned?

What?

Rod could return?

No, Rod was lost.

Lost? What happened?

Do not know. It seems that
another patrol took her.
Who?

I do not know, Reggie says
saw some Scouts.

Reggie, who saw?

What?
Beware!

Sorry ...
Rifles always in front!

My grandfather said
we should put the rifle ...
Charge!

Leaning on the shoulder, hence
point y. .. Yes, in that position,
point, and then shoot.

Although never shoot
anything, we practiced with cans ...
So you've never fired.

Look, I do not know who's Vara
but it is our responsibility to return it.

Why us? No
known to us had.

Whoever it is carried saw
Reggie, and will tell everybody.

That dishonor us for life.

That's not good.

Who will do something like that?

Maybe it was the crickets Cantores
Polar Bears and Ice Cream ...
Combat Or Yaks!

Or maybe the Forest Owls,
for having dropped his pants
one of their patrol.

Yes, they should be
wanting revenge!
Why?

Because ...
Never mind, it already happened.

It will cost us care for our
reputation, not the other Patrols
we have exactly love.

Hey, do not know who has the Vara.

The only thing we have to
do is stay alert.

If you see or hear something,
Keep calm, and let me know.

Then recover
and return.

Anyone have a better idea?

Ok, then we will do that.

And I learn a lot from
guys, is really good.

Long have
Scoutmaster sos?
Three years ago.

Really?
Yes, indeed.

How old are you?
31.

Want to reach 32? Then
Shut up and let me work.

Focus!

Hey York!

This is my world ...

So we wet the fiber
before passing it through the media.

They must be careful not to twist
fiber, or the basket will be deformed

Basketry and may not approve.

Reggie, is here any
which you saw with the Rod?

I had not noticed ...
For fijate!

Hey, why you do not
yet begun?

It is enough, I quit!

Learn how.
Hey, that yes it is cute!

Ok, Scouts, listen.

I will turn my canoe. Their job is
to get this far, rescue, and carry the canoe
to the bank, without turning your own canoe. Ok?

Who goes first?
Us.

I like that! A brave Patrol!
Here we go, rescue me ....

Wow! What good is the water!

It's so hot that if I put
noodle soup would be made!

Okay, come on
side, do not be afraid ...

Is this the guy?

What guy?

Forest Owl, who stopped you
on the road. Clint told me everything.

Yes

How did you cope?

I only see stupid
over all his Patrol.

But how?
Do not know.

AJ defended you?
No, I did it myself.

And now what do we do?

We have to make them pay.

Why?

Because I threatened.

Nothing happened.

Do not be silly!

Tonto why?

Threatened you in front of the whole Patrol!

Not even scared me.

Not understand it, Jared.

We are a patrol, if anyone messes with
any of us gets to everyone!

I'm just trying to protect,
I do not want anyone hurt you.

Okay, but why do you think
I can not defend yourself?

Because you never do.

But this time it did!

Okay guys
very good rescue!

Should have brought my
skies, what a great trailer!

We will do
better go!

"You all stand up straight

I can wait!

Anyone want candy?

That will send them ...

This device is
very good, Jared.

Reggie, cut it!

If you floor it, I
slip and kill me!

Not just me doing it!
Who else?

Anyone else ...
God!

Thanks, Poseidon!
Sorry ...

They are ready to sleep, Miss?

York! York! I do it?
He told us ladies!

Do what, Reggie?

The other time someone
told us ladies, York ...
Reggie ...

No, what happened?
What did they do?

York pulled down his pants.

Reggie, please!

Okay, it's good
who can defend.

Well, I would never do that.
Yeah, me neither.

Okay, Jared, but
sometimes you have to leave
clear that one can not play.

All right, everybody to sleep,
and no flutter by.

You know, once I dropped my pants
someone. Once I fought with someone
also, for a girl.

As Instructor
basketries?

Yes

She looked at me with affection.

Impossible! I was looking
MY fondly. I saw her.

What?

Why would you look at yourself?

I do not know, maybe I just
could not resist my charms.

You're delusional, would look at a frog before.

I know I was looking at me.

And how are you so sure
you looked at yourself?

Saqu√©monos doubt:
I'll ask.

No! AJ, that's not fair!

Right?

Are you sure you talk
you will love.

And, what's the problem?

I am sure
I was looking at me ...

Silence! At my signal ...

Reggie, stop spitting!

Cut!
What is it?

Hey!

Wait, you do not know what
may be out there!

I'll catch them!

They had better run!

Who already are! Tomorrow
arrange accounts!

The shoes
have achieved.

Who were they?
It does not matter.

Were caught?
No, they escaped.

But who were they?
It does not matter.

What matters is that he was somebody.
What do you mean?

These things should not happen.
They cannot come and attack us like that!

We are the Dragons of Fire!
We have to earn respect!

Have something to do with the Rod?

Even so, they have no right
to disturb this!

Maybe they learned
we have the Rod.

We had it!

Guys, do not understand!

This is not the wand,
is respect!

We have taken for fools, not
we are doing anything about it.

Basketry was recorded in only
because the instructor is cute?

Ryan does not get to fresh water because it has
fear of sharks saltwater!

We do not need nobody to make us
look bad, we ourselves
do well!

We took the greatest treasure
Rakhouta camp, and let
someone else we hand it off!

We can not leave
to keep things well,

or continue to haunt us!

And what about the Raising that
guided? That did not do well?

I do not think that counts ...

If you like to be awake
bombuchazos at midnight, I think
perfect. But I can not live like this.

And then, what are we doing?

Be Prepared!

A sleep!

Wait, I'm still not ready!
Sorry ...

Reggie!

Okay, I'm ready.

Good night.

What is "hovering"?

Going well, Reggie, Keep it in
pan, to cook well.

Keep it in the pan.

Jared, for breakfast.
I have no hunger!

Ok, I show you how you have
to do: Once you are
gilt, the turn around y. ..

If you drop of bacon grease on clothing,
is very difficult to remove, so ten√©
careful not to get dirty.

Keep it in the pan! Oil
jump and you can burn!

Anybody want eggs?
No. ..

Eggs, Ryan?
No, thanks.

Clint, eggs? Today will be a day
heavy, need protein ...
No, thanks.

AJ, eggs?
No thanks, I'm vegetarian.
Ok, more for me ...

These eggs are very good!

Come on guys, I have a gift for you.
Keep your eyes open.

The symphony of proteins.

These are for you.
Thanks.

All of these eggs for me!

Ryan, be brave.

These are going to do well.
Ok.

Roger, good luck.

A win!

To my favorite Scoutmaster.
Tomorrow you cook.
Yes, sir.

Novices, Scouts, Scoutmasters ...

Who wants to make a
Camp cry?

Okay, let's start with
The worker bees!

Why Buzz?
Because we want!

Why chop?
We are hot!

Why are "yellow" (cowards)?
Not we!

We are the Road Runner!
Eat our dust! Beep! Beep!

We are the Yaks of
Fight! Attack!

Okay, guys, well done!

This is not to win badges.
Neither of Knots.

Not to walk much.
Walnut squirrels are crazy!

Forward Chipmunks!

Squirrels ... Squirrels ... Squirrels ...

It's true ... They are totally crazy!

Are you ready?

Reggie ...

Yes Sir, we're ready.
Okay, go ahead then.

Hey Reggie, use this.

Ready? Let's make
Camp better cry!
Yes, we are ready ...

Put on the glasses. Ready?

Guess Who's Coming?

Here they come!

Fire Dragons arrived here
and are all ready to say,

If you mess with us will pay,
be friends, or out of here!

If you're feeling bad and you know rap,
Think it twice, I'll show you!

At Camp we play,
and in any competition the first place!

At Camp needs to be done,
over the Dragons, nobody can beat!

And everyone knows it, and everyone sees it,
the best rate, the Dragons have it!

So come on guys, are not thieves,
and give a good round of applause for the Dragons!

Forward Dragons! Yes!

So, the Dragons have fire
in the mouth and rhythm in her blood!

Now that was rapping!

Roger! You just watch! Go and tell!
I can not! I'm scared to death!

Where are you going?

Hello!
Hello ...

Hello!

Hello ...

How are you?
All right. Vos?

All right.
Ok.

What are you doing?

Only leather work
we had to do ...
I like, is very nice.

It represents the love I have for ...

What?
He said ...

Your friend said you wanted me
ask me anything.

No, not really, it's nothing.

Wait! In fact, there is something.

I think you're very cute.

I was thinking ... Perhaps at some point
now or after the Camp ...

We might, go to
watch a movie or something ...

That's a yes or no?

No sharks in fresh water.

No sharks in fresh water.

Yes that is me fighting back!
It's quite a monster!

Do not you run away, do not leak!
Yes, it seems like one big,
must have eaten too much!

You're the one who must have eaten
the 17 Scouts who disappeared from
Camp last season!

No escape ...

"A Scout smiles and sings
even in difficulties "

You'll end up in my frying pan!

Rakhoutaaa!!

Ops, I hope that
Scout can swim ...

I do not want to escape
a piece so big!

I must be brave, I must be brave
I must be brave ...

Thanks!

You swim like a shark!

Well done!

Great!

Now we pay the
Aquatic Specialties.

Go to change you.

The sandwiches are really good
when you do "Super Shell"

Yes, it's amazing!

You did your pancho Super Peel?
Yes.

I wish I had happened to me!

Clint, are you okay?
Yes

Bye Kerry.
Goodbye ...

Is that what I think it was?
Went to the bathroom alone!

We must achieve if we
get it back in one piece!

You got to make cake?

Wait for me!

We'll be back.

Is rich.
Chau Kerry.

What nice guys!

I have a hurry!

That was not Dragon Patrol?
Yes, and had toilet paper.

Go to KYBOs.
Follow him!

Guys ...

Where were they?
With my future wife!

Seriously? The Instructor
Basketry? That caramelito?

Not a caramelito. It is a bombonazo! Chocolate
hot sweet and falling on my lips ... After
see, I can not call "nice" to anyone else in the world!

You gonna call?

Man! This girl is writing!

Hey, let's go!

What happens?
Clint went to the KYBOs, alone!

Please!

Should have gone in
Service Station!

Forest owls!
Kybo hide yourselves behind!

Disperse in silence!

Forward, slowly ... Get down.

Must be more behind the KYBOs.
Reggie! Shh!

I told him it was in the
Service Station!

That was four days ago!

Silence! Could listen!

A dragon in there?

Come on, I left! We want
teach us to rap!

I left it now This is no time
keep your eyes open.

Keep your eyes open?

Kybo "Keep Your Bowls Open"
(Keep your eyes open)

Ah, I see!
Shh!

Hey!
Ohh, looks like it
there anybody in there!

Whose hide, doll?

Hey, those are the Scouts who saw me!

You see?

Yes, when I had the Rod of the Spirit!

Are you sure?

Yes, he also called me
"Doll", I remember it well.

Brother, are many.

Better. It will take several to stop!

Hey, you!

Sorry ...
Shut up!

Watch the door.

They have three seconds to take the
most important decision of their lives.

Oh yeah? What do you do?

I'll see you all!

Dragons!

Now we will see who is the best!

Fly with your wings, Dragon!

You have stolen the Rod of the Spirit!

And you took it away!

Of course not! Tu
Tommy was left in a tree!

Will throw the Kybo!

You have it! Where is it?

I tell you do not have it! It's true!

CONFESAL! I know you took it away!

I tell you no! On my Honor Scout!

Scout's Honor ...

Clint! Done?
Yes!

Boys, you know what to do ... Now!

How do you know that they
really do not?

I just know.

I could see in her eyes.

One cannot lie in
a moment like that.

I think so.

No. I swore by his Honor Scout.

While they were fighting.

I do not think we violated the law both
Patrol. We will have our
differences, but both are Scouts.

I have to find that Rod.

Hey ...

I think it's here!

What?

Yes, this is where
Reggie says he left the Rod!

It's crazy!

I cannot see anything!
We want you to bring a flashlight?
No. ..

I cannot believe we
Rakhouta lost the Spirit!

Rod are you referring to?

Everything is so different from last year ...

Our patrol was more ... together.

Always trying to outdo ...

And I keep thinking that ...

This year, we have not done anything good!

What legacy are we leaving
for future Scouts?

York, who cares who took the wand?

What do you mean?

Well, it's just a stick.

Yes, you're right.

Nobody knows that we take it off.

So back home,
without saying anything, and we could
save our reputation, right?

York, I mean it's just a stick.

Rod of the Spirit of Camp
Rakhouta is a symbol ...

I must be brave, I must be brave ...

... Which represents the strength of
Bear and Eagle speed ...

If you talk, surely conquer.
And what is the problem?

... Is the greatest treasure and the largest
Rakhouta Camp pride ...

Go ahead, Rakhouta!

... Which reminds us of what it represents.

Is that you never defend ...
This time I defended myself!

... For all Scouts
camp out here, get the force
Bear and Eagle speed.

You're right, it's just a stick!

Let's go to sleep!
Definitely.

And if someone sees us?
It does not matter.

And if we get into trouble?
It does not matter.

Come on, guys.
W√°cala, sticky ...

Reggie, get comfortable on
handkerchief, and suddenly the middle.

Ok, enfrent√©mosnos to
consequences of our actions.

Reggie, I'm going to talk. And remember,
no matter what happens, always
Fire Dragons will be.

Go ahead.

Hi guys.

Come in, come. How are you?
Glad to see them ...

Your Dragon Patrol has left us
impressed these days.

We are Dragons of Fire!
Ah, yes.

We've been having fun,
so expressed in the song
what we did in Rakhouta.

That is fine. Should be fun and
learn, that's the idea of ??the Camp.

Will have several stories
have when they return home.

You bet it does.

Very good, very good.

How they fare with
Camp activities?

Very good! One of the boys
Audrey got the phone.
It's pure chocolate!

Chocolate?

As a chocolate,
hot sweet and falling on my lips ...

What a good boy!

I can help you?

Lord, it was our patrols the
which was the Rod of the Spirit.

It was an accident, I took her thinking
I was one of the replicas ...

We had been before ...

but did not want it all
Scouts we know that
such fools in our Patrol!

I see.

This Patrol cut a tree,
Kybo fell just above, while
his Scoutmaster was inside.

These two eight canoes sank
while in the camp!

When they returned to their homes, swimming
better than an Olympic medalist!

This Patrol ...

... They had to sleep in wet bags
because someone accidentally spilled
canteens all over them.

This is You?

Believe me, if the Spirit of Rakhouta
could be ruined by errors
committed by the Scouts,

this camp would
closed many years ago ...

Rod is a very important symbol
for the camp, but more important
Scouts are learning from him.

I am proud that they
had the courage to come
return personally.

Is ...

Where is it?

We lost.

I'm not the only one
to know about it.

Novices, Scouts and Scoutmasters.

What wonderful days we spent!

Field Headquarters
has enjoyed as much as you
These days we spent together,

We have had wonderful experiences, and we
learned together to be more respectful of
Nature and tradition, and ourselves.

So who wants to delight
Camp with their cries?

What is your name?
What is your name?

What sound do?

Crickets are the singers! Yes!

I love you guys! You make me happy!

We are the Polar Bear Ice Cream,
not that we are lazy, is
we're frozen! Brrr!

To this should
remove to the Uniform!

And now, a message
Fire Dragons.

It's time.

Those are my boys!

In fact we will not do
a Camp Gulch.

Just wanted to say it was our
Patrol which took the Rod of the Spirit.

Are the worst!

Keep calm, York, finished speaking.

One of our Scouts
took it by mistake, and we lost.

What? How is that possible?

It was not intentional.

They are a disgrace!
Tell them it was an accident!

They are a disgrace to
Scouting around!

It's all we had to say.

Come on guys, that's all.

Get lost! Manga's useless!

Were right to tell the truth,
and I'm proud of you for that.

Fire Dragons showed
great value to take care of their mistakes.

Stayed together
as a real Patrol.

Although the Rod of the Spirit has been lost,
Camp Spirit Rakhouta endure.

We had still a long way
Scouts to be exemplary

we then several more camps,
earn more badges, including some
of us become Knights Scout.

But it was from that moment, from
that York gave us this important lesson,

that each of us went
to make every effort, from that day.

Okay, now we must continue
Screams from the camp.

It is up to the Fire Dragons.

Adelante!
