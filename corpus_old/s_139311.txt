Another one coming down.

Hang on.

THE MASK

I got those...

concert tickets you wanted.

You're kidding!

For Friday night?

Stanley, this is great.

What time do I pick you up?

Here's the thing.

My best girlfriend is here
and she'd die to go to this...

so could we get an extra ticket
for her?

They're sold out. That means
there's no more.

I can't let her sit home all alone.

I'll tell you what.

Go with your friend.

I couldn't do that.

No, come on.

Stanley, you are the nicest guy.

Really, you are.

Isn't he the nicest guy?
The best.

That was the most sickening display

I've ever seen.
I disagree.

I'm wearing her down.

Buddy, you need a little
change of pace.

Tonight, I'll take you
on a love safari.

Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungle.

Tell me more, bwana.

The Coco Bongo Club.
Hottest new joint in town.

Only the cr me de la cr me
need apply.

How do we get in?
Are you kidding?

Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy.

This will be the perfect...

night on the town.

Hold the phone.

Killer at three o'clock.

Stand back and observe.

Where do I open an account?

New accounts,right here.

You're lucky, I was on my way out--

Hold this for me, please?

I'll hold anything you want.

Can you help me?

So...

what kind of account do you want?

Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
just terrible with things like that.

That's an interesting tie, Mister...

Ipkiss, Stanley lpkiss.

Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.

Pleasure's all mine.

May l?

What?

I'm such a mess.

Oh, of course.

That's what they're there for.

As I was saying, that tie...

reminds me of those,
what do you call it, ink blot tests.

A Rorschach test.
Right.

It sort of looks like...

a young woman riding bareback.

Sort of...

Lady Godiva or something.

Of course.

What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

I don't know.

Bright colors...

It's a power tie.

Supposed to make you feel...

powerful.

Does it work?

Now, how about that account?

We have...

several different plans.

Savings.

Checking.

Savings and checking.

Savings and CD's.

Checking and CD's.

Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills.

Or we can throw your money
in a big mattress.

Now, I have some forms
for you to fill out.

That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right.

Keep it down back there.

We'll try.

What do you think?
Layout's not bad. But...

the motion detectors are a pain.

But you can pull this off, right?

You talking to the Doctor.

I do have one question.

Which is?

What's Niko have to say about this?

Nothing.

This isn't his grift.
Get real, man.

Everything is his grift.

He owns you, he owns this club,
he owns this whole stinking town.

Things change.

You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap.

He's the only one who's napping...

and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up call.

But we need cash...

so first we take the bank...

then we take Niko...

and then, my friend,
school is out.

And this whole city is our playground.

Bub, watch where you're going!

Hang on, hang on!

Don't get your panties in a twist.

What the hell is it?

I don't know...

about seven hundred bucks, eh?

Now, what can I do for you, bub?

I'm here for the Civic.

The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission.

What?!

All I wanted was an oil change.

Lucky we caught these problems
before they caused serious trouble.

Sign right here, and press down hard.

There's no price.
There will be.

I've no car.
I need a car tonight.

Bring around the loaner.

The loaner?

The loaner?

It's a classic.

Gals, meet my buddy Stanley lpkiss.

Humungo in the banking business.

Not really.
Let's get in this joint.

How you doing, buddy?

It's Charlie!
How you doing?

How you doing, my friend?
Long time no see.

Good to see you.

Come on, gals.

See you on the inside.

This is a mistake.

You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

My friends are inside.
Lose him.

This isn't fair.

Watch it, I'm a bleeder.

Put me down now, or I am
never coming back here.

Jeez.

Mr. Ipkiss!

Hi.

Are you okay?

Me?

I'm great..

Really good.

I never felt better, really.

I'm just...

catching some air.

Your car, sir.

That's not my car.

It matches the ticket.

Alright...

I'll take it.

But I am very angry!

Believe this?

You drive in in a Porsche...

Hey, Mister!

Hold on!

I know CPR!

Hey, you!

What are you doing down there?

I'm just looking for...

my mask!

I got it.

Do you have any idea what time it is?

Actually, no.

My new carpet!

Well ,this is coming right out
of your security deposit.

You know...

What?

Nothing.

Well, that's what you are, lpkiss,
a big nothing.

Aren't you due at the lab
to get your bolts tightened?

I should have said that.

Hey, you.

Milo!

No jumping up allowed.
It's against doggie ordinance.

What do you want?

You want me to throw that?

I'm very tired.

I'll throw it one time.

I won't throw it with you
attached to it.

You ready?

Get it.

Ipkiss!

Turn down those cartoons!

Alright, Mrs. Peenman!

Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody
wears a mask?

That's correct.

We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking.

We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

and adopt a more socially
acceptable image.

The book is "The Masks We Wear"
by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

Thank you for being here.

What's the matter with you?

What is it?

What are you looking for?

You like this thing? You like it?

"The Masks We Wear".

"That's correct.

We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking".

Yeah, right.

Smoking!

It's party time.

P-A-R-T-Y

Why? Because I gotta.

MANAGER

QUIET PLEASE

Snooze!

Look, ma, I'm road kill!

Get out of the road!
I think he wants to communicate.

squeeze me gently

Hey, mister...

you got the time?

As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

Look at that!

Time to honk your nose and pull
your underwear over your head.

Come on!

Step right up here, don't be shy!

Nobody likes...

a bashful leather head.

Move it!

For my first trick...

I'll do something for you, son.

We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

Now...

Sorry, wrong pocket.

For you...

a little body English.

A French poodle.

The dog was rabid, had to put it down.

At last but not least, my favorite.

A Tommy gun.

This is incredible.

With these powers I could be...

a superhero.

I'd fight crime,
protect the innocent...

work for world peace.

But first...

RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING

Hold onto your lug nuts...

it's time for an overhaul.

It was a dream.

It was a dream.

I must lay off the cartoons.

Lt. Kellaway. You know anything
about the disturbance last night?

Disturbance?

Some prowler broke in
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

Attacked?

You didn't hear anything?

She unloaded a couple of rounds
of buckshot 5 feet from here.

Look at the floor.

He put that right in my floor,
then he jumped out...

the window. Officer,
are you writing notes?

This is...

impossible.

Those pyjamas are impossible.
This happened.

See, I have...

an inner ear problem.

Sometimes I can't hear anything.
Is that so?

Here's my card. If you recall
anything unusual about last night...

anything at all, call me.

You bet. Thank you.

And good luck...

cracking the case.

Oh, my God, I'm late!

Keys, keys...

Where's the keys?

Damn.

Get the keys.

Find them.

Get the keys.

I am so late.

Good boy.

Come on, Milo. Give them to me.
Drop it.

I want a proctologist standing by.

The best one you can find.

Can you tell me what happened?

No, you can quote me.
Looks like some Mob tactic.

She broke the case. Come on,
get these rubbernecks out of here.

Where were you last night?
We looked all over for you.

Did you happen to look outside,
in the gutter?

Did you check the paper?

Your girlfriend got a great review.

Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo

You're 50 minutes late.
That's like stealing.

I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never
happen again. I've been a jerk.

If you weren't busy oogling
girlie pictures...

you might get some work done.

Sir. She's a perspective
client of Stanley's.

Really?

The next time she comes in...

send her to my office.

You bet.

Gee, I wish "my" daddy
owned a bank.

Then I could be a rich
little creep too.

You think she'll ever come back?

Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.

Girls like her always look for
the BBD: Bigger Better Deal.

You don't know that.

She's an artist. She's...

sensitive.
Forget her.

She'll rip out your heart,
put it in a blender and hit "frappe".

You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth.

Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

red hair...

full, pouting lips...

a white blouse, green jacket...

and a name tag.

You really narrowed it down.

Too bad she's already taken.

Hello there, may I be of assistance?

Stanley lpkiss?

Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune.

I canceled my subscription because
they kept stealing--

No, actually, I want to ask you
a few questions.

Really? About what?

Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?

Me?

I don't even have a car.

You know, 'cause they pollute.

You don't own an '89 Civic?

Oh, that car, yeah.

It's coming back to me.

Miss... What was your name?

Peggy Brandt.

Wait a minute.

Peggy Brandt?

Of "Ask Peggy"?

That's right.

You printed one of my letters
last year.

Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."

You're Mister Nice Guy?

Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

100's of women are looking
for a guy like you.

Really?

You know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.

Why are you covering this story?

Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

I'm looking to become a real reporter.

When you were at Ripley Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

Anything?

I won't make trouble for you.

I just want the truth.

God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do.

If you think of anything...

this is my number.

This is my...

you know, personal number.

100's of women are looking
for a guy like me?

Sure.

I'm one of them.

120 yards.

Hello, Dorian.

Thanks for dropping by.

Next time, call.
Leave the delivery boys at home.

The cops...

tried to shut the club
down this morning.

They say you've been using the place
to run your own small-time scams.

When I hear things like that...

I start losing my concentration.

My game...

it goes straight to hell.

You could too.

205 yards.

I'm fed up with you...

but....

I'll cut you a break.

One week to get out of town.

After that...

I'll use your empty little skull
to break in my new nine iron.

Are you okay?

Your car, sir.

I am now.

Tina, come on.

You can't.

You can't.

Go on.

I don't believe it.

Stupid.

She would never...

No way!

Hold on, Sugar.

Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

Somebody,stop me.

Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green.

I better make a little stop.

EDGE CITY POWER
"SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR"

How's it going, Freeze?

It's looking good here.

You're on your own. I must
go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.

Do it.

The doctor is about to operate.

Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.

Cops!

Not on the list, not in the club.

How do?

You on the list?

No, but I believe my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?

Franklin, Grant...

and Jackson.

That's it! No one gets in.

Now we present the most beautiful
flower of the Congo Bongo...

Miss Tina Carlyle.

Beautiful.

Love makes me treat you...

The way that I do
Gee, baby...

ain't I good to you

There's nothing too good...

for a boy that's so true

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

I bought you a fur coat
for Christmas

A diamond ring...

a Cadillac car...

And everything

Love makes me treat you...

the way that I do

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Love makes me treat you...

the way that I do

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing too good...

for a man so true

Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

I know how to make a man happy
I'll treat you right

Why are you here?
There's trouble.

You better come upstairs.

Come on, let's go.

They got me paying taxes...

for what I gave to you

Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Let's rock this joint.

Smoking.

What happened?

Someone hit the joint before us.

Get that, Doc.

Suck on that.

Son of a bitch!

Who did this, man?

Who?!

Him!

That's the guy.

The guy dancing with Tina?

He's dead meat.

Come on.

I want this place cleared now.

Club's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

Party's over, let's go!

Get out of here.

Get lost!

Okay, Twinkle Toes.

Where is my money, tell me now.

You've got 17.5 %  in T-bills
amortized over the fiscal year.

8 %  in stocks and bonds.

Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

Fortunately, funeral bouquets
are deductible.

Ice this deadbeat.

Shoot him!

Thanks.

You got me, partner.

Hold me close,Red.

It's getting dark.

Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.

Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home
this Christmas.

Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.

Pardon me.

Thank you.

You love me.

You really love me.

You're not going anywhere.

Drop it, Tyrel!

Drop it.

You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?

What I got is probable cause.

Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.

Easy. You're giving me a woody.

And one was wearing a big,
green mask.

For once, you're right.

Except it wasn't one of my boys.

Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

Cuff him.

We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist.

Call that high-priced
lawyer of yours.

We'll go downtown for a chat.

Get him out of here.

I know you're in there.

Police!

Open up!

Oh, my God.

I know you're in there!

Open up!

Come on, I'm getting blisters
on my fingers.

Stop it.

I'm coming, okay.

I'll be right there.

Let's go, move it!

Alright!

Hi, Lieutenant.

This isn't the best time right now.
I just--

Won't you come in?

Where were you last night?

Here, mostly.

Something wrong?

What do you know about The Mask?

"Mask?"

Don't insult my intelligence.

He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

There can't be 2 idiots
with these pajamas.

May I see those pajamas?

Those pajamas?

Those pajamas...

were stolen.

Somebody stole your pajamas?

What is this city coming to...

when a man's pajama drawer is
no longer safe!

Look at that guy.

Nobody's that fast at my bank.
I'll say.

That's one hell of a rubber mask.

Lab reports?

We got fingerprints from currency,
but nothing matches Tyrel's men.

He beat them to the punch.

Get the bank employee files and run
down the prints on a guy named lpkiss.

You figure it was an inside job?

I need some prints to lock
this whack job up till doomsday.

50 grand...

to whoever finds that green bastard
before the cops.

I want you to get the word out
to every street hustler...

every low life in this town.
Understand?

I want him here tomorrow, alive.

You still here?

Come on, let's go.

What are you looking at?

You.

You're losing it.

I'm not losing anything...

except maybe some extra baggage.

What's that mean?

You didn't fight much last night
when that freak kissed you.

Did it look like I had much
of a choice?

Maybe you did...

maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

I'll tell you one thing.

It's going to be payback for anybody
who crosses me.

We have a crisis here and you
stroll in an hour late?

If I must put up with--

Back off, monkey boy...

or I'll tell your dad you treat
this place like your piggy bank.

Or we should call the IRS...

and arrange a vacation for you
at Club Fed?

That'll be all.

Genius.

That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.

God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

I'm not sure.

I haven't exactly been myself lately.

You don't look real fabulous.

Really, do I look bad?

Don't worry. This'll put the color
back in your cheeks.
