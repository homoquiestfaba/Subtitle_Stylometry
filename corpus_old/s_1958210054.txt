Are you ready?

We're ready.

Ready to forget,
once and for all.

Good, Mr. Lambert.

So then, close your eyes.

Both of you.

Now take a deep breath.

Now feel yourselves
getting sleepier and sleepier.

Neither of you will remember
the last year.

There is no place called
The Further.

You will only remember
Dalton's coma.

And his recovery.

And let the darkness drift

further and further away.

"For everything,
there is a season.

"A time to be born

"and a time to die.

"A time to kill

"and a time to heal.

"A time to keep

"and a time to throw away.

"A time to weep

"and a time to laugh.

"A time to mourn
and a time to dance.

"A time for silence...

"...and a time to speak.

"A time for love
and a time to hate.

A time for war
and a time for peace."

Amen.

Amen.

We therefore commit
this body to the ground.

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

dust to dust.

Amen.

It was a beautiful service
for a beautiful grandma.

She loved
you guys so much.

Your mother was
a fine friend, Josh.

Thank you.

I miss Grandma.

I know.
She misses you, too, Kali.

Dead people
don't miss anything.

Okay, that's-that's not true,
and she does miss you.

See you guys
next weekend, okay?

Dalton.

Dalton!

See what I mean?

He's just anxious
about leaving.

For school next week.

I know. Yeah, uh-huh.

Um...

Thank you
for organizing all this.

I just haven't had
the bandwidth.

Why don't you drive him
to school?

You have a few weeks until all
your students show up, right?

Nah, he-he-he wouldn't
want me to.

He's not the parent. You are.
I mean, if you don't want to,

then that's
a different story,

but...
I... No, I can't.

Why?

Well...

It was just an idea.

Maybe s-some way that you guys
could connect, that's all.

You know,
he's gonna be gone soon,

so, anyway, think about it.

Bye.

See you, man.

Excuse me.

Excuse me. Hey.

Do I know you?

I knew your mother.

Years ago.

Um, but w-we lost touch.

What's your name?

Carl.

Nice to meet you, Carl.

Appreciate you coming.
I'm sorry I grabbed you.

I got a lot on my mind.
I'm sure.

Death floods the mind
with memory.

But there's always
new ones to make, right?

Yeah.
Bye, Josh.

Carl.

What did you just tell me?

Well, just tell me, Dalton.

Change it?

Do you want a clean...

Do you want to keep
the same diaper on?

Yeah?

I tell you what.

We can clean... we can
just clean out the diaper,

and then put the same diaper
back on.

Would you like that?
Would you like that?

Okay, yeah, I'll do that then.

What kind of outfit
do you want?

What kind of outfit
do you want?

Yeah? Well, tell me.

All you got to do
is talk to me.

Come on.

The greatest guy in the world.

Oh, shit.

Uh, I mean...

Yeah, great.

All right.

Okay.

Okay.

â™ª As soon as you are able â™ª

â™ª Woman, I am willing â™ª

â™ª To make the break that we â™ª

â™ª Are on the brink of â™ª

â™ª My cup is on the table... â™ª

You hungry?

You're gonna have to pull out
of your little funk,

or it's gonna be
a long few days.

Mom said you got
that art teacher you wanted.

What's his name?
Her name. Armagan.

She good?

She's the best.

Good job.

I mean, she better be,
with what we're paying.

â™ª To love and cherish â™ª

â™ª To guard and guide... â™ª

All right.

Let the fun begin.

â™ª Oh, God, forbid â™ª

Thank you.
â™ª That one should perish... â™ª

Yeah, you. Come here.

Hey, man,
welcome to JPU.

Kappa Tau, huh?

I was, uh, Kappa Z.

Long time ago, of course.

I'll take one for him.
Just put-- Thank you.

Hey!

â™ª They live so far â™ª

â™ª Away... â™ª

Sorry.

Oh, all right.

You get first dibs.

Why don't you
pick a bed?

Mom got you this, uh,
power station thing.

What do you got here?
You got, uh, two outlets,

USB port and, uh,
two jumper cables,

which are useless.

There we go.

Okay.

Okay.

You still need this?
Guess Mom put it in there.

Whoa.

This is intense.
This what you been working on?

Put it back.
No, it's really good.

Did you do this from memory?

It's from a photo
I found at the house.

Wow, looks like she's, uh...

Like she's hiding something?

That's what it feels like...

felt like,
the last few years.

She had a tough go, you know,

being a single mom.

Yeah, yeah.

That's... yeah, that's tough.

Guess I didn't make
the wall, huh?

I don't blame you.

You know, I'm sorry
I haven't been around lately.

Course, my dad wasn't
around at all, but...

Could be a lot worse.

I've just been a little foggy
past few years.

I don't know, my brain just...

I just...

haven't been able
to manage time for, uh,

you and your brother
and sister.

Have you ever thought
about getting help?

I'm just trying
to push through.

Are you Dalton Lambert?
Yeah. Are-are you...

Chris Winslow. Mm.

Everything cool, fellas?

Yeah, no, everything's fine.

I just-- I thought my roommate
would be a, um, um...

A-A guy.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Oh.

I just figured
it's a liberal arts school,

and we mean "liberal."

Yeah, pr-probably just confused
by the name Chris.

Right.

'Cause that would never happen

with a name like Dalton.

You know, I'm gonna go down

to the housing office
and get this all sorted out.

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

Please, Father of Dalton.

Allow me.

I clearly interrupted
some... boy bonding.

I'll be back.

Hey, uh,
I snagged this for you.

You should check it out.

If you hate it, no worries,

but you're not gonna hate it.

You really don't know me,
do you?

I mean, you really think
I want to join a frat?

It's just a party, Dalton.

Go. Have fun.

I mean, do it for me.
I drove you here.

You didn't even want to.
Course I did.

Stop lying to me!

I-I heard what Mom said
at the funeral.

Well, I still did it.

Oh, so that makes you
father of the year now?

At least you've got a father.
Stop blaming your dad

for the shit
that you screwed up.

He left like 40 years ago.
Get over it.

God knows I'm not gonna be
defined by you.

Are you kidding me?
After all we have done for you?

When did you become
this ungrateful little shit?!

No wonder Mom divorced you.

Thanks for the ride.

Excuse me.

Want me to take that?
Yeah.

Here, I got it.
Thank you.

You can tell
it's Shania Twain, right?

Yeah.

So, what'd they say at housing?

They said, "Tough titties."

I got to sleep here tonight.

But I'll get
a new room tomorrow,

so it's not a permanent thing.

Heartbreak, right?

You're in the art school,
I take it?
Yeah.

Are you music?
Math.

I thought about music,
but the artist's life

is one of nomadic instability
and much gnashing of teeth.

But I'm sure
you'll be super successful.

You want to blow my hooter?
What?

Do you play?

Oh.

Uh, just-just a little piano.

It's the same thing.

Just blow.

My cooties are good cooties.

What's that?

It's just something
my mom wrote.

Sweet.

So, what's some weird shit
about you?

I don't know.

"Uh, I don't know."

Come on, man.

Everybody's weird.

Y-You first.

On Sundays, I wear a monocle

and I order takeout
with a British accent.

That is weird.
Thank you.

Okay, sometimes I eat
instant oatmeal,

uh, with no, like, water
or milk or anything.

It's just kind of dry.

You're bad at this.

Let's try again.

When I was ten,
my parents died,

and I went to go live
with my Grandma Perkee,

who once went
almost nearly blind

from a gnarly case
of athlete's foot.

I don't remember
when I was ten.

Like, the whole year.

What do you mean?

I was in a coma.
Viral meningitis.

At least
that's what they told me

the few times
that they would talk about it.

But I don't remember anything.

I don't even remember
being sick.

It's like I woke up one day
and a whole year had passed.

That's awful.

And pretty weird.

Well done.

Yeah, honestly,
I wish I could have forgotten

a whole year when I was a kid.

Could've used
a little meningi-gi.

Uh, you know, there-there is

one more weird thing about me.

Um, ever since my coma,
I've...

I've been afraid
of th-the dark.

I was afraid of Barbie dolls
till I was, like... now.

There's nothing wrong
with being scared.

Just as long as
you don't keep me up

with some bright-ass
night-light.

Um...

Seriously?

Sorry.
Oh, man.

Whatever.

It's fine. I'll deal.

Hey, this is Dalton.

I can't get to the phone
right now,

so leave me a message,
and I'll give you a call back.

Hey, bud. It's me.

Just making sure
you're getting settled in okay.

Um...

I was just, uh, thinking about
what you said,

and, um...

I don't know. I don't know
what's going on with me,

but, um...

...I'm gonna find out.

And I just wanted you
to know that.

Okay, bye.

Hello. I am Professor Armagan.

Shut off your phones.

Open your portfolios.

Pull out something
that will interest me.

Pin it to your easel.

Stand beside your work.

Stand proud.

Alec Anderson.

Your technique is obvious.

It looks like a photograph.

Thanks.

That wasn't a compliment.

Tear it up.

Excuse me?

The drawing.
Tear it up.

I worked my ass off
on this piece.

No one will miss it.

No way.

Alas.

Our first casualty.

Usually, I go through
introductions

before someone quits.

I didn't quit!
Yes, you did.

You just haven't
realized it yet.

You can go.

Good luck.

Any fool can learn technique,
even master it.

It doesn't mean anything
if it doesn't come from inside.

I am not interested
in the rules of art.

We are going to break
the rules.

Then I want you
to break them again.

See how broken you can get.

Dalton Lambert.

Yes, ma'am.

Why in the hell
would you destroy

a beautiful drawing
like that?

Once more for good measure.

Wasn't so hard,
was it?

Good.

You must let go of your past,

shed your skin
in order to grow.

I'll count backwards from ten.

With each number,
I want you to sink further

and further into yourself.

Do not lift the charcoal
from the paper.

Ten, nine,

eight, seven,

six, five,

four, three,

two, one.

Draw whatever your soul
brings forth,

an experience that defines you.

You've got to be willing
to dredge up

your ugliest,
innermost thoughts.

Is it keeping you in or out?

You'll have
headphones on.

The machine is quite loud,
but you'll be able to hear me.

And I'm gonna need you to stay
as still as possible

throughout the procedure.

You feel like you need
to get out of there,

give the call ball a squeeze,
we'll give you a break.

You good?

Overjoyed.

All aboard.

Don't forget this.

Okay. You comfortable, Josh?

Yep.
Let's just get this over with.

Hello?

Dr. Brower?

Dr. Brower?

There's someone with you.

Wh-What?

What did you say?

Dr. Brower, what did you say?

Wh...

Come on.

Um...

Okay, can you
let me out, please?

Hello! Hey!

Can you let me out?!

The door is open.

Okay, okay. Let me out.

Let me out! Hey! Dr. Brower!

Dr. Brower, let me out!

Come on. Get me out of here!

Hello?!

Hey!

Just let me out.

Let me out, let me out,
let me out.

Dr. Brower?

Come on.

Let me out.

Okay. Come on.

Okay.

Mr. Lambert?

What was that? What was that?!
Are you okay?

What was that?!
Why did the lights go out?!

Calm down.

Y-You said the lights went out?

All the lights went out,
and I got stuck in there, man.

And I saw...

Mr. Lambert, you've been asleep
for 15 minutes.

You went right out.

Uh, your MRI
went perfectly.

What?
Take your time and get dressed.

Come on through.

There's nothing
physically wrong with you.

No growths or spots
on the brain.

Nothing to be concerned about.

That's good news,
Mr. Lambert.

Yeah, no, I know.

I, uh...

I guess I was just hoping
for something real.

Something that could
explain this... fog.

The memory issues
you're talking about,

they could be spurred on
by a number of things.

Increased stress,
change in daily habits.

Have there been any disruptions
in your home life?

My, uh, mom
passed away recently.

I'm sorry for your loss.

Not to mention
my son left for school,

and, uh, my ex-wife
hardly talks to me, so...

That certainly
sounds stressful.
Yeah.

Maybe a grief counselor
could be of some help.

Yeah. Sure. Probably would.

Do you have any history of
mental illness in your family?

Mental illness?

It's nothing to be
alarmed about.

It can be informative
as we try to make a diagnosis.

Not that I'm aware of.
It's worth looking into.

Meanwhile,
there are exercises,

games you can do
to stimulate your memory.

Matching games,
like-like-like kids do.

You want me to play
kids' games?

We could learn a lot from kids.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Whatcha doin'?

Got my new
room assignment today,

so, alas,
no more panty parties.

But consolation: I'm in 323
now, right above you.

So be cautious, young man,

lest I hear you slap your
sausage in the dead of night.

You want to join a frat?

What? Oh.

No, it's just something
my dad got me.

We should go.

We can make fun of their
khaki pants and trust funds.

Unless you're not done
redecorating.

Come on, Dolphin.

Do something nice
for your old man.

What's the worst
that could happen?

May I offer you
some diaper pudding?

Uh, I'm good.

Uh, no.

Whatever.

Seriously?
Oh, come on.

Quit your bitchin'
and come here.

To memorialize the night

that Dalton Lambert
actually has fun.

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

What's "frat juice"?

Don't ask.
Hey, hey, hey!

Everyone, my name's Nick.

Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick!

Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick!

Welcome to the Kappa house,

and welcome back to school,
baby.

I'm just here to remind you,
fine folks,

that frats,
they're under attack.

Right?

And we must protect
our right to party

and to be awesome.

White, Black, brown or blue,
you're all welcome at JPU,

provided that you recognize
and respect

that the frat house
is the last house

where men can still be men!

Thank-thank you.

Now, we got a lot of drinking
to do tonight,

but pace yourselves.

We do not need
another incident.

Yeah, rest in peace.

Party's lame.
Confirmed.

So let's go upstairs and
look through everyone's shit.

Yeah.

We should make this quick.

Permission to proceed granted.

Wait.

Huh. Oh.

Oh, no.

This is Nick's room.

And this is
Nick's butthole cream.

I'm gonna go spread this
on the communal crapper. BRB.

Wait.

Hey, man.

Hey, man, you-you okay?

You need water or something?

Make it stop.

Make it stop.

Make it stop.

Close the door.

Close the...

Close the door!

No, no, no, no. No, don't leave.

Come on, I just...
I-I'll be right back.

I just need some, uh, supplies.

Hey, Paige. I am Nick.

â™ª Tonight is your night, bro â™ª

â™ª Tonight is the night. â™ª

Gotcha.

Come on, man.

Just be you, bro.

You want to dance?

Let's dance.

Let's dance.

Oh.

â™ª Tonight's the night, bro. â™ª

Be quiet.

Are you good?

I think I just saw...

What?

We need to go. Now.
But this is just getting fun.

Yo, is somebody in my room?

Shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Come here.

One of you peckerwoods
is about to get the hammer drop.

Mmm, mmm.

What the hell?

Oh, my God. So sorry.

We were just looking
for some privacy, you know?

We were gonna do it.

I'd rather watch
my parents do it.

But you should stick around.

We might get drunk enough
to find you attractive.

Even though
you look like a clown.

Nick the Dick, huh?

I'm more partial
to kick the dick.

Run.

That was pretty quick thinking
back there, right?

I, uh...

Oh, crap.

Ugh, I should've asked
before I kissed you, right?

I am sorry. I was just--
I was going on instinct.

Oh, no.
Are you okay?

I'm fine.
It's just, I, um...

I'm just sorry
for what he said to you.

Oh.

Whatever.

You think I care
what Vineyard Vines thinks?

He should be so lucky.

Hey, buddy, it is, uh, me again.

Um, I went to the doctor.

Um, and-and everything's okay.

Well, not okay, but, uh,

I'm getting
to the bottom of it, so...

Uh, just give me a call
when you can. All right.

I lo... I-I, uh...

I'm really sorry, Dalton,

about what I said
the other day.

All right, bye.

Where is my mayonnaise?

Who is it?

Please don't tell me
you're really just a creep.

What? No.

Then what the hell
is going on?

Come on in.

Something's happening to me.

I'm seeing things,
crazy things.

You know that kid
at the frat house

that they talked about
with the incident?

Uh-huh.
I saw him, and he was dead.

It started with
an art exercise,

and she asked us to dig deep
into a memory,

into our-our subconscious.

So I did,
and I drew this door.

You really need
to lay off the frat juice.

I'm serious.

Tonight, I was painting,
and I fell asleep.

And when I woke up,
this lantern appeared.

It... it was like a dream,
but it wasn't a dream.

And then I-I walked
to your room.

I-I know
how this sounds.

I feel like I'm getting
closer to something.

Or something's
getting closer to me.

You got an extra pillow?

Okay.

Foster.

Renai.

Dalton.

Kali.

Dalton.

Dalton?

Dalton!

Mom.

Okay.

Okay, Mom, help me out.

Kali.

Dalton. Dalton.

Mom.

Mom?

Mom.

I don't know. I don't know.

Okay.

Right.

Chiaroscuro.

The dance of light and shadow.

An effect used not only
to create volume and definition

but also a specific,
unseen light source.

Right.

This is one of Goya's best.

The negative space
draws our eyes towards Saturn.

Does it represent darkness
or some void?

Goya mastered it on the canvas,
but family problems

and health issues...
Please, Daddy.

...sent this once revered
court painter

into a dark spiral,
leading him to create

this grisly portrait
of a father devouring his son.

This balance between
light and dark

is what we're after.

Get ready.

Your own experiences
shape your artwork.

Embrace them.

Use them.

Sink deep into
the darkness of memory.

Ten, nine,

eight, seven,

six, five,

four, three,

two, one...

'Sup, nerd?

A red door.
A purple pecker.

Come on, man. Doesn't that
mean anything to you?

A red door?

You sound weirder than usual.

It's a thing from art class.
It's a painting.

We had to find a memory.

I thought it was something
from our childhood.

Did you ask Mom?

No, I don't want to worry her.

Why would that worry her?

I don't know.

Is this what happens
when you go to college?

You get all cryptic and shit?

I guess.
Well, I'm not going, then.

So, after the whole spooky

dream-not-a-dream thing
the other night,

I started thinking,
"Yeah, okay, Dalton's a weirdo,

but he's not insane, right?"

I'm gonna need that key back.
Right.

So, I started poking around
the old interwebs,

and guess what.

You're not crazy at all.

You are an astral projector.

Check this out.

Looks like they filmed it
in between shifts at Best Buy.

Hey, guys,
this is "Spectral Sightings."

I'm Specs.
This is Tucker.

Say hi, Tucker.
No.

Okay. We are PPI, Professional
Paranormal Investigators.

Today, we're gonna be
talking about something

that dozens of you
have been asking us about.

Astral projection.

It's a real phenomenon.

Our physical body falls asleep,

and our astral body

leaves that physical body and
floats off into another realm.

That's exactly
what it feels like.

See, I told you.
It's cool, right?

Our former mentor,
Dr. Elise Rainier,

she had a name
for this other realm.

She called it The Further.

Hold on.

I am Elise.

It's nice to see you all.

So, I'm here to talk to you
about astral projection

and The Further.

Okay.

Give me a minute here.

Three,

two,

one.

The Further is a dark realm

filled with tortured souls
of the dead,

and some are doomed

to live the worst mistakes
of their lives

over and over and over
for all eternity.

When you astral project

or you travel to this realm,

these are the souls that
you awaken with your presence.

They can smell you.

The presence of life.

Life is what they crave
more than anything,

so the further you travel,

the riskier
the journey becomes.

They want life, and they can
come to our world to get it.

Keep a steady stride.

Oh, I see those gears turning.
What is it?

That kid from the frat house?

The pukey kid?

Yeah.
He said something to me.

He said, "Close the door."

I'm sure he did. It probably
wasn't his proudest moment.

Yeah, but what if
he meant something else?

What if he was
talking about this door?

So, what,
you want to go back and ask him?

Seriously?

I need to know.

I-I feel bad for the dude,
I do, but...

dark realms are typically
places I try to avoid.

There's something...

important about
this painting, Chris.

I have to find out.

Okay.

But it's not like Nick the Dick
is just gonna let you

waltz into his bedroom and chat
with the ghost in his toilet.

He'll never know I'm there.

So, what's the plan?

I got this.
Can I help you?

Hello.

I have left my brassiere
in Nicholas's room,

and I was wondering
if he is perchance home?

I think he's upstairs
studying with Paige.

Great job, Dolphin.

So, I'm gonna read you this.

It's called "In Flames."

Very vulnerable piece.

"Looking across a campfire,

"they say it's beautiful.

But without you
on the other side..."

I need a room with darkness.

Okay.

Then what?

You gonna float through the air
and do a little, "Ooh"?

I'm not, like, a ghost.

And you never will be
with that attitude, Casper.

Bingo.

What are the chances
those bedsheets are crusty?

Probably snap
like a taco shell.

I'll take the dirty floor.

Okay.

Can you, like,
give me a little space?

Oh, yeah. Sorry.

Okay, you ready?

Ten, nine,

eight, seven,

six, five,

four, three,

two, one.

Are you floating yet?

Farewell, traveler.

You out here, Dalton?

Probably be a creative
writing double major.

But I'm also crazy good
at finance,

so I don't want
to waste that gift.

How long do you
have to keep that on?

Oh.

Yeah, it's good now.

My pores are good.

Uh, I'm-I'm-a be a while.

Gross.

Dalton?

Dalton?

S-Someone, turn on the lights!

Dalton? Dalton?

Dalton, wake up.
Chris.

Guys! Seriously.
Guys, who's messing with me?

Close the door!

Close the door!

Dalton?

Close the door!
Chris!

Oh, God.

Come on!

Chris.

What?

Come on.

What?

Chris. Chris. Hey,

I didn't mean, like, that...
Don't.

I-I just wanted to see
if you're okay.

I'm okay.

I'm sorry.

I didn't know anyone could
get hurt in the real world.

Well, they can.

You have no idea
what you're messing with.

I can't be
a part of this, Dalton.

And neither should you,

because next time,
you might not wake up.

Hey.

Hi.
Uh, it's not your weekend.

Kali's at a sleepover,
and Foster's...

I'm not here for the kids.

Can we talk?

Sure.

Wow, two calls in one week.

Come on, man.

Haven't you made
any friends yet?

Tell me everything you remember
about my coma.

You should talk to Mom.

I-I think these-these things
I-I'm drawing, they-they...

The door?
And now a guy with a hammer.

A hammer?

I-I think they could be
clues from my past,

thoughts that have disappeared
'cause of my coma.

I don't know why
that they're coming out now,

but they are, and I...
Wait. Dalton.

What is it?

I've had this image
in my mind for years.

Mom always says it's not real,
it's just a bad dream, but...

Tell me, little brother.

Come on.

Okay.
We're in a room somewhere.

Like a basement.

Do you remember that?

Dalton, you there?

All I ever wanted was to be
better than my father.

You know that.
Just to be a... a good dad.

You were. You are, Josh.

Well, Dalton would disagree.

Well, uh,
if it's any consolation,

I can't even get him
to call me back.

My dad abandoned his family,
and I've done the same thing.

No, you haven't.

You're not him, Josh,

and you're allowed
to be angry at him.

I am angry.

I've been angry
for a long time,

angry at a man
that I have never met.

Angry at a man
that jumped off the roof

of a mental hospital
in 1978.

For more than 40 years,
that man has been dead and gone.

My dad. Ben Burton.

So how in the hell is
he terrorizing me here, now,

in the real world?

He attacked me
at Mom's place...

He attacked you?
Yeah.

So-so am I just crazy or...

I don't know.

He, uh...

...left this for my mom
the day he died.

What ends with him?

Josh...

Is-is that the answer?
Am I just crazy?

Is his madness inside of me?

And is that why I've been
so lost the past few years?

I mean, did I pass this curse
on to our kids?

I mean, is he gonna haunt them
like he haunted me?

Josh. Josh. Josh.
I mean, why didn't my mother

say anything about this?
Stop. Stop. Stop.

You're not crazy.

You're not crazy.

Then what's happening to me?

Dalton.

So Dalton and I could travel
to some other...

...dimension,

where we were haunted

by ghosts and goblins.

More like entities,

like the one in those photos
that haunted you.

And your father,
he saw them, too,

and maybe
he's just reaching out.

Back then, he told your mom.
She didn't understand.

She-she didn't know
how to help him.

Oh, help him
like you helped us?

By suppressing our memories?

We all thought it was for
the best, Josh, you included.

But you got foggy.

The suppression,
it-it slowed you down.

And your mom and I,
we didn't know what to do,

and I was too scared
to tell you the truth.

Dalton was right.

He said my mom had secrets,

that she was hiding something
from us.

I just never thought
you did, too.

For ten years...
You have no idea how hard

it has been for me.
For ten years,

you kept this away from me. Why?
Honestly, you don't know.

Just why? Why? Why?!
Please. You don't understand.

Because you tried
to kill our family!

You chased us around the house
with a goddamn baseball bat!

What?
I mean, I knew
that it wasn't you.

I knew it was that thing
in those photos.

But the kids?
They don't understand.

All those night terrors
that Foster had.

I've been lying to our children
for a decade,

telling them
those memories aren't real.

"They're just your imagination.

Dad's not gonna hurt you."

I couldn't.
But you did.

Doesn't matter to them
what was controlling you.

What they saw was your face.

It was you who was
causing all that pain.

That's why I pulled away.

I just...

I couldn't live
like that anymore.

You know...

...we could've gotten
through this together.

Is this you?

Dalton just sent this to me.

He's been having nightmares
and visions.

Something about a red door.

And now this.

What do we do?

I'm scared.

It's gonna be okay.

It's gonna be okay.
I don't know...

Hey, nothing's gonna
happen to us.

I promise you, okay?

Take care of your brother,
Dalton.

Okay.

Here.

But why is Daddy mad at us?

Mommy. Mommy.

I can go into the dark place
and find Daddy.

No, no, no, it's too dangerous.

I-I can do it, though.

Okay, just be careful.

No! Stop! What are you doing?!

Stop! What are you doing?!

Dad, please just stop.
Just stop!

No!

Stop!

And now, my dear friends,

I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of you out there,

wherever you may be.

This song is for you.

â™ª Fill your heart
with love today â™ª

â™ª Don't play the game of time â™ª

â™ª Things that happened
in the past â™ª

â™ª Happened in your mind â™ª

â™ª In your mind,
only in your mind â™ª

â™ª In your mind â™ª

â™ª Forget your mind,
and you'll be free. â™ª

Just checking on you.

Okay.

Sitting on the floor,
being weird.

That's normal.

So you're good, right?

Because I thought
that when the power went out

that maybe you're messing with
that dark realm shit again.

And I know that you
don't really care for the dark,

so I figured
I would illuminate your room,

much like how
I illuminate your life.

I'm not afraid
of the dark anymore.

Okay.

Well, I hauled these
all the way down here,

so they're going up anyway.

Even though they're
totally freaking annoying.

Geez.

So, um, listen.

I got your text,
and I wrote a snarky response,

and then I deleted it,
because Grandma Perkee

always told me to never
escalate an argument over text.

Doesn't convey tone.

But, I mean,
if you want my opinion,

here it is.

Don't go digging around
in your past.

Some things are just better
left buried, you know?

And sometimes
you just have to move on.

Dalton?

Hey.

Dalton.

You okay?

â™ª Knee-deep â™ª

â™ª In flowers, we'll stray â™ª

â™ª We'll keep the showers away â™ª

â™ª And if I kiss you
in the garden â™ª

â™ª In the moonlight â™ª

â™ª Will you pardon me â™ª

â™ª And tiptoe â™ª

â™ª Through the tulips with me? â™ª

Dalton.

Dalton.

Dalton?

No.

Oh, no.

No, no, no!

Daddy's here.

I'm gonna get you out
of this place, Dalton.

We're gonna get out of here,
and we're gonna get home, okay?

We're never going back there.

Dalton. What?

Dalton?

Dalton, tell me
you're in there.

Dalton.

Dalton, I know you're in there,

but if you touch me again,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

Dad, no!

You tried to kill me.

It wasn't me.

I saw you.

Dalton, these things,
they can possess our bodies.

It happened to me,
and now he's done it to you.

He's coming back for you.

We've got to go.

Come on.

He's coming. Go.

Dalton, help me!

Dalton, come help me
hold the door!

No!

We can't hold it back, Dad.

Son, we got to try.

Go! Get away!

No! No!

Dalton, come on!

We're gonna have to find
s-something to block it,

something to seal it!

Come on. Let's go.

Dad, please.

Dad, we have to go!

It's okay.

You go.

Go.

Get away!

No!

No! Oh, God.

Josh.

Josh.

This ends with me.

Paint?

Paint. Dalton.

You need
to get rid of that thing.

Burn it. Forget about it.

No, no,
forgetting it doesn't work.

We need to remember.

Even the things
that hurt.

Dad?

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Is Dalton okay?
He's okay.

Okay.

That's him.

Dalton.
Is Dad back?

Yes. Yeah, he's back.
He's okay.

Are you okay?

I'll see you next Friday.

And tell Foster to pack
his history homework.

I'll help him with it.

Could come a little earlier
if you want, join us for dinner.

Yeah, I'd like that.

Okay.
Thanks.

Lovely home.
Oh, thanks.

Do you live here?
Uh, I hope so.

That's a weird answer.

Guess I'm just
lost in memories.

They can flood the mind.

I know you.

May have seen me around.

I know your mother.

There's so much
I want to tell her.

I know.

And you can.

And you will.

Someday.

You have a bright future ahead.

You and Dalton.

Keep a steady stride, Josh.

Wow.

I made the wall.

Yeah.

I love you, son.

I love you, too.

â™ª If this world
is wearing thin â™ª

â™ª And you're thinking
of escape â™ª

â™ª I'll go anywhere with you â™ª

â™ª Just wrap me up in chains â™ª

â™ª But if you try to go alone â™ª

â™ª Don't think I'll understand â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª In the silence of your room â™ª

â™ª In the darkness
of your dreams â™ª

â™ª You must only think of me â™ª

â™ª There can be no in between â™ª

â™ª When your pride
is on the floor â™ª

â™ª I'll make you â™ª

â™ª Beg for more â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª With me â™ª

â™ª You'd better hope and pray â™ª

â™ª That you'll make it safe
back to your own world â™ª

â™ª You'd better hope and pray â™ª

â™ª That you'll wake one day
in your own world â™ª

â™ª 'Cause when you sleep
at night â™ª

â™ª They don't hear your cries
in your own world â™ª

â™ª Only time will tell
if you can break the spell â™ª

â™ª Back in your own world â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay â™ª

â™ª Stay with me â™ª

â™ª Stay with me. â™ª
