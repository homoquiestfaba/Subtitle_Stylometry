Fifhteen years ago in Tromaville,

New Jersey, the Toxic Chemical
Capital of the world

little mop boy Melvin Fyrd,
a 98-pound weakling

was teased taunted, and other bad stuff,

until he fell into a barrel of
toxic chemical waste.

Transforming him into a hideously
deformed creature

of superhuman size and strength;

Melvin became The Toxic Avenger,
the first superhero from New Jersey!

Then two really shitty sequels were made...
sorry about that.

This is the real sequel.

Okay kids, today we're going to celebrate
our special friends below the border.

We are going to celebrate take
a Mexican to Lunch Day.

Can we say that?
Mexican.

Very, very good.

Now that's where the hard working
Mexicans take naps during the day.

Just like us?

Just like us. Exactly like us.

Tito, v_hat do you think you're doing young

Listen bitch, iust because l'm a tard

doesn't mean that you have to treat
me like one.

But because l'm ''special,'' l don't

for the

We're going to go live now to the
Tromaville School for the Very Special

where our correspondent Cindy Tata
is

Tromaville police chief Newman
about this very subject.

Stick with us aRer the break where
our very own Josh Levitsky

will share some of those mouth-watering
recipes for butternut squash.

Oooh, aaah, l like that
That's good

Like a living Martha Stewart
But isn't she still alive?

Nigga, please.

Chief Newman, what caused the
Diaper Mafia

horrible acts of violence?

Well, uh, ah, no comment.

l can't believe this is happening in

You ask me, these diaper mafia punks
ale

What is the use of sending these
retards to school in the first place?

All right, Tex, time to
kill another one.

Yes, daddy.

Chief Newman, the Diaper Mafia has said
they will execute

a special student every half hour
until their demands have been met.

Really?

Yet it's been at least 35 minutes since

never mind

Well, that's a damn shame it had
to happen on

Take Mexicans to Lunch Day and all.

You hear that, pigs, you hear that?
You

A tard dies every five minutes unless

You got that?!

Got that got that?

l'm working on it, really
l'm working on it.

Please don't shoot any more
of those tards.

l mean those special kids.

Fuck the fucking tards! l'm sick and
tired of their drooling and whining!

Now why is it when l shit my pants,
it's a fucking social faux pas?

But when a tard shits his pants,

a good-looking nurse wipes his ass
for him, huh?

She's got her head up her ass.

Tex, Tex, Tex check it out! Pregger
pi-ata! HA HA HA!!

Hey hey, you've got your head
up your ass!

Fuck you!

Fuckin people!

That's what separates us from the
pussies like the Trenchcoat Mafia,

the Flat Top Mafia, and
the No-Pants Mafia.

Didn't you hear what Kazinski said?
Fucking tard.

Gun!
Nooooo!

Mayor Goldberg, how do you feel about
the

Try not to harp about the five
that are dead.

Think about the hundreds of students
that are still living, still breathing,

and let's pray for an end to all
this murder and mayhem and garbage.

Let's pray.
Let's pray.

Get off the phone!

Let's pray, godammit!

You too.

Oh lord, in your divine wisdom,
please find it in your heart

to put an end to this murder
and filth and trash and garbage.

Oh, and please help us to get
re-elected one more time ok?

Thank you very much God, and amen.

Amen.

Dye-a-nu

Thank God you're here.
What took you so

l had to change. It takes a while.

Yeah, ok. All right, kid, hold on,
all

l got the Really Real Bikini TV crew here.

The Diaper Mafia's demands have not yet
been issued, and yet,

speculation has already begun as to the
motivation behind the senseless attack

on the mentally feeble student body.

What do you think, Nick?

l'm gonna have to go with heavy
metal music on this one, Jason.

Aah, interesting.

But what about that best-selling
video game Kill All the Retards?

Could be a factor, Jason

But we cannot forget about
the rap music.

Very popular with the kids. l
personally, am not a fan of rap music.

l think you could put a c in front
of rap and call it you-know-what.

l don't think you should go that far.

Not a fan.

l think you're going too far.

Not a fan.

All right, l think you've
established that.

You know l think the worst part is that
we'll never know

Well that won't stop me from casting my

We would never glorify it.

You like that, don't you retard?

Hello, Tex, Samantha Chambers,
Really Real Bikini TV.

This is my morbidly obese sidekick.

l mean, cameraman, Joe.

Well Samantha, looks like l won't
have to frisk you for weapons.

Hey, listen lady, l didn't call you
in here to fuck you.

l called you in here because the
Really Real Bikini TV show is

the number one show in America.

Now tell fatty there to turn
on the camera.

l'm gonna show ya something.
Okay.

You see this bitch right here?

Wasting perfectly good tax dollars
trying to ''teach'' the un-teachable.

And if there's one thing the Diaper
Mafia hates more than RETARDS,

it's genetic traitors.

Now, l'm gonna show you what we do
to bitches like that.

Kiss your school goodbye.

He understands this world is full of
unthinking cattle that need to be

And the first step in the process is to

genetically mutated freaks and shit!
Ha-ha-heh-heh.

That' wasn't a nice thing to say.

Excuse me, miss Wiener

Toxie, you were always my best student

Thanks!

No Toxie! Don't let your Tromatons

Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D why aren't
you in there helping the Toxic Avenger?

l'm a New York City police officer

besides Toxie suggested l stay out here
and stake out the area.

Yeah because l can guard everyone

l think you should actually come
in here

Thank you for shopping at Kmart.

No Melvin, there's no time!

Lardass, no! Don't eat the bomb

Lardass, NO!

Even your superhuman stomach
can't contain it! Noooo!

What have l done?

lt's ok, Toxie, sweetie loves you

Speak for yourself, biotch.
Fuck this man,

l'm outta here. Get outta my way pussies.

Oh Lardass!
My friend.

Alright men, ready, aim,

make guns go bang.

Alright men, move aRer him
and use extreme caution.

That lumpy headed bastard is dangerous.

Get in the car!!

Oh? Ok. l suppose l owe you a thanks.

Don't mention it boss,
l'm just glad l decided to stick around.

You iust can't trust school
kids these days.

Crack deal?

Crack deal? Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD
what are you talking about?

Sgt? NYPD? What?

Huh?

What's wrong with you, Noxie?

Are you selling the crack or
are you smoking it?

Huh?

Shit! Hang on Noxie!

Noxie?

Did you see that? That was a stop sign!

Oh!

Lookout!

What are

Those are police!

What's wrong with you Noxie?

You'd think you've never been
chased by the cops before.

l haven't.

Everybody back, everybody back,
just relax, stay calm.

Toxie you alright?
What happened in there?

Hey medics, get over here,
get Toxie over to the emergency ward.

You alright?

Come here!

Stay back everybody! He's armed.

What the hell did you do to the chief?

Wow! Go Toxie!

Toxie, what could've prompted this

vicious attack on the citizens of Tromaville'

No fucking comment.

Here how bout some hand me downs.

YES!

Any final statement?

Shut your fucking cake hole!

This doesn't look good.

No it doesn't fuckin' look good.

We should do something

Do something like what? Did you see
what he just did to the fuckin' chief?

Fuck that, l'm leavin'. Are you comin'?

Yeah, ok.

Faggot #1 meet faggot #2. Bingo!

Say it ain't so Toxie, say it ain't so.

lt is so. Hold this fat ass. Oopsie daisy!

Coming up at 1 1 =OO, Toxie kills
virtually everyone in Tromaville.

And our very own Josh Levinsky
gets jiggy with it.

Hang on Noxie, l can't pass this up.

Kabukiman! That was an illegal U turn!

Old Lady dead ahead!

This is an American made car.

Every time they flip 25 feet in the air
and crash down,

they blow up! Let's get out of here.

God damn.
Oh Toxie!

Toxie, the children picked these for you.

Ah, go fuck yourself.
Toxie!

What the hell is going on here?

What is going on indeed.
The events, which you are witnessing,

have proven my theories regarding
the truly fragile nature

of the space-time continuum.

Nurse.

Blackboard

Perfect.

As you can plainly see,
for every dimension,

there exists a diametric opposite of
that dimension. When two explosions

of equal mass occurred simultaneously,

the barrier between Tromaville, and
it's dimensional doppelganger,

Amortville, was weakened for a moment.
This breach caused the Toxic Avenger,

and his evil opposite the Noxious
Offender to enter each other's reality.

Well, that's pretty good for a shriveled
up cripple, who can't get it up.

That is it hell-bitch. l don't need to
take this shit from you.

My erectile dysfunction has been
resolved see. Thanks to the modern

miracle of penile implant it merely
takes a few squeezes of my scrotal

_ey Noxie! Where ya been? Long time no see

Hey Noxie, want some of this?

Ah No thank you.
Thanks for the offer but no.

What is this evil, evil place?

Toxie! Nice work at the school my friend.
You need a ride some place?

Grandma, grandma, grandma, grandma,
grandma, grandma, grandma

How am l supposed to smoke this crack
without a fucking pipe?

Fuck off Spazmo, that's the deal.

But, but, but, the deal was the three
of you guys for a rock and a stem.

Look, look, look, you got your crack
right, right? Now, go smoke your shit,

and get out of here.
We'll try not to fuck her up

too bad for you, okay?
Bu but but, that wasn't the deal

That's it. Now l'm going to have
to freak you.

Stop that right now.

Hey, hey Noxie. What's going on man?
You wanna help us beat up the retarded

guy?
Or you, hey you wanna help us rape her?

Yeah, yeah.

Didn't you learn your lesson last time
l Disemboweled you, shoved your head

up your ass, and killed you
with your own diaper?

What? What? Huh?

Guess not.

Sweetie, are you okay?

The bad boys were trying to touch me.
Bad boys, bad boys.

They're gone now, everything is okay.
Keep calm you sweetie and honey.

What's your name little girl?

Sweetie Honey.

Uh, okay. Do you know where you live?
We gotta get you home.

l tried but, my home was gone. 1 122
Maplegrove Rd. Tromaville, New Jersey.

Just like Grandma said,
and it was gone.

And you? What the heck were you doing?

Looking for a crack pipe.
What did it look like l was doing?

lt looked like you were selling
Sweetie Honey for drugs!

And it looks like l saved you
from a severe beating.

What are you doing here,
and where is your home?

Man, l don't have a home. l am a loner.
And Sweetie's house is gone,

iust like she said.

That is ridiculous.
Come on, Sweetie Honey.

See kids, here's the dump, right where
l said it would be.

Now we'll go in my shack
and call your parents.

Parents? No parents, mom and dad died
and then Auntie Em took me in,

but Auntie Em hit me too much so then
nice lady took me to grandma.

Well, we'll call whoever, and Sarah
will make you some lunch, and

Where's my shack? It was right here.

See? l told you.

Yeah, it's a lot safer here.

lt's dangerous and unpredictable

So iust stay here and l'll be back for
you just as soon as l can, okay? Bye.

Stay here, stay here, stay here.

Who does the Toxic Avenger think he is?
My parents? Fuck this place man,

l'm out of here.

No! Tito, you can't go. Toxie said
to stay here. He's over there,

and you're over there and we have
to stay here. Tito, no,

Kay.

Let's go. l am in charge.

Thanks Tito. Will you hold my hand.
No.

That's okay. Please hold my hand.

You know Toxie l used to think that
you were one of those namby pamby

pussy-footin' mother fuckers.
You know one of those bleeding heart

heroes that's always makin'
my job difficult.

But you're actually a bad guy.
You're all right.

Thanks.

Uh oh. You better split Toxie.
This press conference is about you.

l'll hang around and
see what the deal is,

then we'll meet at your house later.
Go on.

My place?
Go go go.

Oh lick my balls. Mother fucker.
Jesus Fucking H. Christ. Fuck.

l never trusted Toxie!
Yeah!

l knew he was bad from day one!
Yeah!

That's my husband you're talking about.
He loves you people!

Bullshit! We all loved Chief Newman.
Face it! Toxie's gone mad!

Yeah!

Wait! Wait Everybody!

Toxie saved me and my unborn child
from the bomb. Toxie's a hero!

Hero's don't double amputate
police chiefs

and hurl twelve-year-old children
into brick walls!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Please. Please. Quiet down folks.
Let's get down to the Lord's work.

We all saw the Toxic Avenger kill,
not only our beloved police chief,

but innocent bystanders as well.

So, we've got to bring him in.
For questioning!

Not shot by some
vigilante citizens group.

Fear not citizens!

l have assembled the only team capable
of bringing him in.

Super Heroes, united one and all,
to protect Tromaville.

And l thank God for it.

Now to introduce them

first, please put your hands together
and give the clap to The Vibrator.

Hhhhhhhhi!

Yeah!

Our next superhero protects creatures
of the ocean.

Please give a warm Tromaville
welcome to Dolphin Man!

Unfortunately, there's not much water
here so Dolphin Man is pretty useless.

But, we have somebody stronger,
more powerful, much better looking.

Who are they going to bring out next?
A cow that walks upright?

Please welcome Mad Cowboy!

Jesus Christ!

Now, when rock super star
Mastur G

and mild mannered
sex offender John Bator

went into the same faulty elevator

little did they realize that they would
emerge as one man

a man that could fight crime with

shear repulsion and bad rhyming.

Please give a warm welcome to combined
Mastur G and John Bator

Masturbator!

Yeah, yeah, yeah. l'm the masturbator,
the freaky palm god.

y egg nog. 01 =42=20=25 ,01 =42=23=10 ,Look out
Here it comes, here it comes,

it's comin' up Tromaville.

What a dumbass.

Why, l could take him out with
my heat seeking chopsticks,

or, or l could suffocate him with my
computerized 16 bite sushi,

or burn him, burn him with my
pyro projectile parasols.

l have many more to take him out, but
l don't think that will be necessary,

Toxie will come in on his own.
He was just having a bad day.

We all have bad days! You know,
maybe we don't go around ripping

off the arms of the police chief, and
bash priests and cops in the heads with

Thank you!

He's probably bi-polar. Abraham
Lincoln was bi-polar and what did he do?

He freed the slaves.

So you see, if we iust sit back, relax,

everything will come to a
peaceful Kabuki conclusion.

Thank you Kabukiman well as you can see
Tromaville is in very capable hands.

This concludes our press conference.

Now, the moment you've all been
waiting for= the puppet show.

Fucking metal ball, fucking grass,
fucking street, fucking fence,

Mayor Goldberg, Tromaville's liberal

kubla khan, dead at 52.

What is to become of Tromadu?

Tromadu!

What will happen to the stately

pleasure dome he built with the

taxpayers money?

Tromadu, where man and beast play,

and women play with each other.

Tromadu, haven to the artsy

and to the fartsy,

and who can forget the

interpretive dancers?

People are letting it all hang out

at one of the famous Tromadu

grotto parties.

Look here, it's the Toxic Avenger,

Tromaville's newest mayor.

Mr. Toxie, how did you find cultural

conditions in Tromaville?

With great difficulty.

Hey Toxie, what do you make of this

easy on the eyes Jackson Pollack-esque

painting here?

Oh,

well l guess everyone's a critic.

Look at these young lovers, enioying

the bounteous pleasures at Tromadu.

l could die in these breasts.

Bullseye!
Cupid strikes again.

And so does Toxie.

That's what l call a faceliR.
Looking good, Toxie.

At Tromadu,
Toxie is always ahead in the polls,

or a pole in the head.

Whoopsie daisy.

Uh oh, the party's over says Toxie.

Wow. It looks like Toxie's
really tuckered out.

Uh, What's that on your face, Toxie?
Nose blood.

Toxie promises his first action
as mayor will be to kill

all those goofy superheroes,
especially Kabukiman.

Oh my gosh, we're doomed.
We're doomed.

We're gonna die.

Wait, we getting all chicken, it's

That doesn't matter now.

All that matters is that l'm here

Oh Chester!

Ooh Yea!

Do you remember the cheese?

l saved the cheese for you, Claire.

l've been waiting so long to
cut the cheese for you, Claire.

Oh Claire, l love you.

You're pregnant!
Ha-ha-ha!

That's wonderful doctor!

You're pregnant with two babies.

Two babies!?

From what appears to be two
completely different fathers.

And that's preposterous!

That must be

good

and evil.

Right.

Well what can l do about that doctor?

Well l'm glad you asked that question.

Nurse?

Oh lovely, iust like that. Thank you.

What l have done is extracted the actual
fluid from the feti inside your body.

This is the good fluid,
this is the evil fluid.

You can tell because it's red.

Now, inside your body you
have to make a choice

because these two right, they're
fighting, fighting, fighting.

One will win, and eventually
this is what it will look like.

That sizzles.

That will be you.

The choice is very simple
and clearly yours.

Either A, you can choose to explode,
or B, you can choose to abort.

Explode or abort.
What does one do?!

l'll have to think about that, doctor.

Ponder not too long because actually
you only have about two or three hours

until this whole process takes place.

Melvin, where are you!?

Look! l told you he'd be here!

Claire says that she knew
you'd be here, in this dump!

lt's the only place l know.

We'd like to thank you again,
for bringing us back together.

Yes, thank you.

So come on, let's get you out of here.

What's the point?

the garbage and the rotting food.

You seem to have forgotten something.

gonna get you out of here,

l meant this dimension!

Dimension.

Come on.

Come on.

Let's go.
We Go

A scientific comrade of mine was
recently killed in a freak accident,

and he bequeathed me his
y 02=19=21=10,02=19=30=05,and all of his insanl
inter-dimensional travel.

Travel.

l hope you don't mind the mess.

Um, no, l didn't even notice it.

Now let's get you back to Tromaville.

l think l've got it, Toxie.

l've found the key to
inter-dimensional travel

in this seldom read scientific tome.

Please tell me it doesn't
involve exploding

a school full of special children.

No, it's much simpler.

You see Toxie, You've had the power
to go home this whole time.

These will help you find your way.

Oy gevalt.

Ooooh.

The operating procedures
are quite simple.

All you have to do is think of home
and click your heels three times.

You may have to try this
more than once.

lnter-dimensional travel is not
an exact science.

You might find yourself in Heaven.

Or you might find yourself on a
1910's gay porno set.

Ready?

Upsy daisy.

Come on, Tito.
Come on, Tito, hop up.

l'm not going.

What do you mean you're not going?

Tito, come on, we've got to go
back to

We don't belong here.

l don't belong anywhere.

But as long as there are people
like evil mabuki pagoop

Kabukiman running around, l must stay
and protect the citizens of Amortville.

Don't forget about your sidekick, Pompey,

the baddest bodyless mother-fucker
in all of Amortville.

l want you to have this,
in memory of Lardass.

Actually, Tito, you've already
made me proud.

My man

Toxic Avenger.

even more deadly!

AIDS. Now that was a good one!

AIDS!

God?
Yeah, what do you want?

We iust wanna go home.

You bastard!
What do you wanna go home for!?

This is Heaven!
This is the best place around!

Ok.

Toxic Avenger, he's from Tromaville.

Alright, you can go back to Tromaville,

but you gotta do me two favors!
Uh-huh.

First you gotta kick the asses
of all the murderers and child rapists!

Yeah.

Toxie is that really you?

You've gone power mad.

The evil version of me?

She's been kidnapped by the evil
Toxic Avenger, the evil you, and

Tonight at 1 1 , bad Toxie goes out

And congratulations Toxie,

Hey, all right.
Also at 1 1

super heroes shopping for tights.

He's a beautiful, big,
bouncing baby boy!

Sixty pounds and four ounces.

Oh, he is beautiful.

He looks iust like you!

Toxie.
Oh, hey Ms. Wiener.

l iust really wanted to thank you

Laqueesha.

She looks iust like her mother.

And l've also brought the special
students in to thank you, too.

Come on in kids.

Hey Sweetie.

Toxie

of the Tromaville School
for the Very Special

and you're very special.

Wow. Thanks kids.

Now we could talk about head
and all that stuff later,

but are you ready to meet your
other new child?

Wait a minute, another child?

The evil baby!

l think a child is as much a product
of his environment as anything.

And l think we have enough love to
raise any kid as a good kid.

Well, if you think so, Melvin.

Yeah, a real American family
for the new millennium.

Awesome!

Now let's take a peek.

What?

What?

Hey, cute kid.

Uh-oh.

Toxie, Toxie, l can explain.

l was drunk, she was tied down.

l forgot to zip up.

Alright, later.

Due to the depletion of the ozone layer

and the careless dumping of
hazardous nuclear waste

thousands of people
find themselves trapped

in an evil parallel universe every year
and the numbers are rising.

This film is respectfully dedicated
to those who have lost their lives

facing down their own
evil doppelgangers.

So if you find yourself thrust into an
alternate reality look to the horizon

one hideously deformed creature of
superhuman size and strength

will be there

yes dear reader he'll be there.
He's the Toxic Avenger.

And please don't forget to recycle
your bottles and cans.

This iust in Jesus out, Satan in.

And l for one worship the dark lord.
Really?

Yeah l do,

You guys get together
and have worship?

We do. Actually this Sunday we're
having a calf slaughtering

at the ninety second street Y,

and our very own Josh Levinsky
will be running a cake walk

and then we're going to sacrifice him.

Really?
Yeah.

That's amazing.
