..more dotcom biIIionaires
per square miIe...

Time to trade in
that oId Ferrari for a brand new...

ModNet's gonna bump my annuaI by ten Gs,
pIus throw in 5,000 shares of stock.

What does ModNet make again?

Nothing. They're an ISP.
CoupIe of weeks from their IPO.

I'm teIIin' ya, this is the crest of
the goId rush, my man. It ain't gonna Iast.

I heard about some guy - came up with
food dot somethin' - he's a miIIionaire.

Food? He makes food?
No, he patented it. The name.

Then he soId it to a company
that buys names. He's set for Iife.

We're aII a dotcom away
from earIy retirement.

Is this the Iife, or what?

You know, my dad used to Iove
making things with his hands.

He was a metaIworker at GeneraI Dynamics.
Right.

One morning, there's a picture
on the front page of the LA Times -

astronauts inside the space shuttIe.

And my dad is beaming because behind them
you can see this paneI that he made.

I mean, he heId this paneI in his hands.

And he said to me that he feIt connected
with something bigger than himseIf.

And that's what I came to the VaIIey to do.
And I haven't done it.

You can't hoId a dotcom in your hands.

Are you having
some sort of mid-Iife crisis thing?

I'm onIy 23.

Go ahead and dream.

FaIcon Fire. Making the improbabIe possibIe.

Chicken suits. You're a genius, Andy.

I don't know what FaIcon Fire is.
I aIready want four of 'em.

Hey, Andy, which cock do you want?

What?
For the bus ads.

BIowfish! Yum.
Uh, the bIack one.

Hey, Andy...

Your ten has been pushed back to 12.

Your four and three are at ten
to prep you for your two.

It Ieaves your ten and two free for your five,
which needs to be rescheduIed.

Your 11 and 12 are coming at ten
to prep you for your two,

and your two has been canceIed.

Look at those geeks. You'd think
they'd shower before a big meeting.

Look at that ugIy IittIe contraption.

Whatever it is, they think
it's beautifuI. And they made it.

What's wrong, Andy?

This morning... I feeI so disconnected.

I'II make up for it tonight.

Go on. Ben's expecting you.

Other way, Iover-boy. It's Tuesday.

Ben's in the parking Iot
getting his teeth cIeaned.

He feIt connected to something
bigger than himseIf.

And that's what I came to the VaIIey to do.
And I haven't done it.

Hey, Andy. Ow!
Hey.

Hey, Boy Wonder! What can I do you for?

I quit.
What?

No more chicken suits, Ben.
I wanna work at La Honda.

La Honda? Are you nuts?

I know it's the worId's most prestigious
research Iab, but that's why I wanna do it.

To work with the top minds.
To be an iron man.

I wanna... I wanna make something.

Something meaningfuI
that touches everyone's Iives.

Some thing that wiII sit on every desk
in every city in every country in the worId.

I want...
The joIt.

You can get me in. PIease, Ben.

You know I can do this.

Shit!

Shit!

C'mon!

Huh? I can't be Iate, buddy!

Hank?
Now what?

You snuck another name on my Titan team.
The team is aIready fuII.

I handpicked that team.
There's no room for this new Caspar.

Andy Caspar comes highIy recommended
from Omega Logic.

LIoyd's continued generosity
funds La Honda.

Boy Wonder's...
Boy Wonder's supposed to be briIIiant.

Came up with those funny ads
for your FaIcon Fire chip.

Chicken suits?

I wanted to sIit my wrists when I saw that.

Everything I invent is dumbed down
by some marketing puke named Andy.

You're 20 minutes Iate, Mr Caspar.
I'm sorry.

I...

I got sidetracked.

This pIace is amazing. It's Iike, uh...

Christmas morning and DisneyIand and sex,
aII wrapped up in one.

This is Francis Benoit, our chief engineer.

I wanted you two to meet before we made
our finaI decision about who's on Team Titan.

Francis, I'm so amped to be here.
I wanna do what you do.

I want a chance to work on something
bigger than myseIf. I want the joIt.

Why do you think you shouId be part
of the Titan? You're just a marketing puke.

With a degree in eIectricaI
engineering from Stanford.

I guess that makes me different.
How?

I might approach a probIem differentIy.
How?

I might see simpIer soIutions.
SimpIe soIutions Iike chicken suits?

Is Francis Benoit reaIIy an asshoIe,
or does he just pretend to be?

FYI, newb, Francis is just everywhere.

Notjust here, but in the VaIIey.

If you get on his bad side, he'II crush you.

So he's an asshoIe?
Pretty much.

To the Iast hurrah!

I can't teII you how jazzed I am.
I don't care about the pay cut.

Do you know how Iong
we can Iive off Top Ramen?

Ten cockroaches can Iive a year
off a singIe postage stamp.

ExactIy. We'II be Iike the cockroaches -
totaIIy unencumbered.

I don't need that big apartment.

Andy, I think you missed the point
of my IittIe cockroach factoid.

I don't want any part
of your poverty experiment.

So... you don't want anything to do with me
without my huge saIary?

WouId you have anything to do with me
without... the saIine twins?

Just drop my diaphragm in the maiI.

The twins are awesome.

No Ioud noises.
Bathroom's at the end of the haIIway.

No hanky-panky in the shower.

Hi, how are you doing?

We have a few rejects from
the Stanford marching band.

MostIy tubas, but I've had everything.

Trombones, piccoIos, ukuIeIes,
you name it, over the years.

I Iived with a fIautist once.
Boy, couId he triII!

Oh, come on, boys.
PIease keep it tidy for me, wiII ya?

Pretty fabuIous, huh?

So what's through the sIiding doors?
Your neighbor. Leave those shut.

No hanky-panky.

I'm sorry, I didn't, um...
Knock?

Is... this the women's?

It's a boy/girI's party, but we stiII knock.

You're gonna have to do it
the oId-fashioned way.

Do what?
Whatever. There are no outIets.

I'm Andy. I just moved into three.
ReaIIy? I think we connect.

I'm feeIing a IittIe something here too.

I meant our rooms connect.

I'm in two. No peeking.

Team Titan, WiIIy. I'm an iron man!

Congrats. Hey, I got my ModNet stock
options today. I'm a paper miIIionaire!

Who says it's sIowin' down?
CooI. Drinks are on you.

I'II meet you at Mr Kim's in an hour.
Not tonight, man.

I'm having dinner...
with your ex-assistant, actuaIIy.

Robin?! My girIfriend Robin?!

Yeah. Uh... she toId me
about the breakup. Sorry.

God, she is so insaneIy hot, man!

HeIIo?

I oughta maiI it through your IittIe skuII,
you Ieeching dragon-woman...

WiIIy's my best friend!

JeaIous? No, I'm not... jeaIous!

In fact, I am having sex right now too.
Yes, I am! You hear this?

SqueaI Iike a tuba for Daddy!

So... taIking to your mom?

Ex-girIfriend screwing former best friend.

Uh, weII, what are you Iistening to?
SiIence.

Safety earmuffs. 97% noise reduction.

I Iike quiet to work.
So you're a scuIptor?

Yeah.

I'm a grad student at Stanford.
My dad wanted me to study digitaI art,

but then I'd be in serious danger
of having a marketabIe skiII.

You're funny.

And pretty.

Brains and boobs. KiIIer combo.

What do you do?
WeII, I work at La Honda.

Ooh. La Honda. EI Car SaIesman.

No, no. La Honda.

The worId-famous research center.
Never heard of it.

Hey, newb. Francis is havin'
a Titan team party.

You can't bring your DS.
DS?

Docking Station?

Oh, my God.

Marketing puke!

Hey, Caspar.

Hey, I'm gIad you're here. Come on in.

Oh, I didn't actuaIIy bring a bathing suit.
That's OK. Nobody did.

There's room next to Griff.
Come on.

I'm...
You're not staying on the Titan.

What?

But Hank put me on the Titan.
Because you worked for LIoyd at Omega?

I don't care.
There's no vanity spots on the Titan.

Move down!
Move down!

Don't worry. I've got another project for you.

VoIunteer for this one and I'II make sure
you work on something, down the road,

that gives you the joIt you're Iookin' for. OK?

It's time.

What's this other project?

A Iaptop computer that retaiIs for $99.

Is that ajoke?

The worId needs a cheap,
portabIe computer, Caspar.

Third WorId schooIchiIdren
wannajoin the information age.

I thought Third WorId
schooIchiIdren wanted... food.

Do this for me and I promise
you'II be part of my next big project.

Titan! Titan! Titan!

It's up to you, Caspar.

You can fiII paiIs... or you can Iight fires.

Now... Iift your arms.

You're quitting the Titan to do what?!
The PC-99.

Are you nuts? Did Francis threaten you?

No, no. It seems chaIIenging.
Who do I report to? Who's my team Ieader?

WeII, you're the onIy one on the project.
I guess that makes you team Ieader.

The onIy one?

But this is an important project, right?
Cheap computers, Third WorId kids.

Anything stopping me
from recruiting a team?

No, but there are onIy
a coupIe of unassigneds Ieft.

If you can get them to voIunteer for your
project, go ahead, knock yourseIf out.

I'm Iookin' for SaIman Fard. SaIman?

Hi. Andy Caspar.
Yes.

Christ! What have you got, a T1?

It cranks. I've got a brown box that sniffs
out the miIitary's secret fiberoptic pipe.

CIA's got a cIassified fiIe on me.
You want to see?

My girIfriend says
don't mess with the CIA, IRS or bikers.

I'm onIy afraid of bikers.

''Domestic and internationaI
eIectronic trespassing:

NASA, Microsoft, the KuaIa Lumpur
Department of Transportation...''

You're a hi-tech bad-ass.
I provide a service.

AII the systems I've hacked are more
secure today because of my efforts.

My girIfriend caIIs me Robin Hood.

It's a doubIe entendre. I'm uncircumcised!

WeII, um... thanks for that image.

So... I'm putting together a team,

and maybe you couId heIp me track down
some of these other names on the Iist.

Curtis Reese is a wizard. TG: Top Gun.

This guy thinks in binary and he craps C++.

Trust me. He couId design the Titan aIone
if Francis gave him a shot.

So why is he unassigned?

Shit.

OK, so he Iacks certain sociaI skiIIs...
Like the power of speech?

I'm teIIing you, Andy, this guy's got the stuff.

Besides, if we don't take him,
they'II put him to sIeep.

I'II handIe this. You go check out the Iab.

Andy? You in here?

Yeah. Over here.

Hey.

Andy Caspar. WeIcome, Curtis.

Tiny.
What's goin' on, Tiny?

Entropy is winning.

OK...

Oh. You Iike that desk? It's aII yours.

Andy? I want the desk next to the firepIace.

There's one more name on this Iist,
and that is... DarreII CIaxton?

This guy is a totaI hard-wired
moby motherboard jockey.

Is that good?

He took an AthIon 750 and overcIocked it to
2GHz, and it's running constant at 38 degrees.

Which is good.
Great! WeII, where do we find him?

Don't buy into the rumors.
I've never had a run-in with him.

What's that he's pIaying?
It's his anger stick.

It's a homemade stringIess guitar.
Lasers teII it where his fingers are.

It Iooks Iike a weapon.
Don't go there.

DarreII.

DarreII?

DarreII!

Don't yeII in DarreII's ear.

Hi, DarreII, I'm An...

I'm Andy.

One drop of this on DarreII's paIm

and you'II be pushin' the mercury past 105

and chokin' to death
on your own mucous in 24 hours.

But you'd be dead too.

DarreII's been inocuIated.

Right.

So I guess a hug's out of the question?

DarreII, I hear you're good with your hands.

Are you coming on to DarreII?
Andy's putting together a team.

Is that drump on your team?

Good. You aII know each other.
How about I buy you guys Iunch?

Fine. But no project-speak before chow.

Nice ride!

Shotgun!

DarreII actuaIIy owns a shotgun.

You take it.

What's wrong with him?
Hey, it's gonna be OK.

Drumpy can't function in the big room.

Where are his shoes?
He doesn't have any.

Now what's wrong?

How do you think peopIe get sick?

Some guy picks his nose,
scratches his ass and grabs that handIe.

You touch it, next thing you know you're
bIeedin' outta your eyes, outta your anus.

Go ahead. Be my guest. Touch it.

Live dangerousIy.

Speak, Caspar. What's your project?

OK. You guys ready to change the worId?

We are gonna buiId... the $99 portabIe.

The cheapie box?!

The cheapie box is La Honda's viIIage idiot.

That project comes up every year.
Nobody voIunteers for it.

It's a topmost WOMBAT.

Waste Of Money, Brains And Time.

DarreII came to La Honda
to burn to the big iron,

not work on some Costco
speak 'n' speII science project.

WeII... DarreII must feeI a tad frustrated
because DarreII didn't make the big iron team.

DarreII is just another broken toy
with no project to caII his own.

Who are you caIIing broken?

Look, I think you're aII terrific,
and I can see you're just marking time here

untiI you get your big breaks as...
Armani modeIs.

But untiI then, I'm the onIy game in town.

DarreII couId be an Armani modeI.

Whatever. Let me just pay
and we'II get outta here.

Pay? That's so cute. Pay...

Son of a...

DarreII gets his best ideas
between 101 and 103 miIes per.

Sorry, Caspar.
Not interested in your cheapie-box project.

DarreII's strictIy big nums or no nums.

Why didn't DarreII teII me that
before I Iet DarreII drive my car?

DarreII wanted to drive your car.

Screw it!

It's a stupid bitty-box project anyway. The
parts aIone are gonna cost more than $99.

It's impossibIe.

WeII... OK, Andy. I'm in.

No, I said it was impossibIe.
Yes, I know.

Anybody can do something that can be done.

My first project.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

WeII, weII, Iadies...

Let's give the PC-99 iron men
the oId Titan saIute!

Bunch of Iosers!

Aqua tofana is
a transparent tasteIess poison

that deIivers death with no reaI symptoms.

I'm in.

He's never officiaIIy been Iinked to any
murders, but I'd stick to bottIed water.

Oh, one more thing.
I get to drive your Porsche.

OK, we're the Iaughing stock of La Honda.
The cheapie-box pussies.

But we're gonna prove 'em wrong.

You're iron men.
You're the brightest. You're the best.

And you are...?

I'm Kriss KringIe.
I'm gonna make the magic happen.

Come on, guys.

Let's buiId a $99 computer.

And nothing's gonna stop us.

Who took the dry markers?

I Iove you, Tiny.

I Iove you.

$1390? Shit, this is impossibIe.

Can't we get rid of some of this stuff?
Why the PC-99? Why not the PC-300?

Because it's the goddamn PC-99,
not the PC-300.

WeII, caII it the goddamn PC-1390
and we're done.

SaIman, any ideas?
The name sucks.

OK, fine. WeII, Iet's start
by thinkin' up a new name.

That's marketing.
If I had wanted to be in marketing,

I wouId have had 'em remove my forebrain.

TeII you what. You naiI the new name
and I'II take you out for a night on the town.

Dinner, dancing, the works.

You're an attractive feIIow, Andy,
but... I'd rather bring my girIfriend.

You don't have a girIfriend!
Yes, I do.

She's very sexy. Oysters make her horny.

You've never had a girI that didn't
cost $3.99 for the first five minutes.

Your mother uses Macintosh.
What?

You heard me. System 7.

AII right, Fard, that's it.
You're dead. You're goin' down.

Sodium oIefin suIfonate.

Boom.

Go team.

New scuIpture?
No, same one.

So what's it gonna be?

I don't know yet.

WeII, how wiII you know when you're done?

NewsfIash. Sometimes it's OK not to know
what you're doing whiIe you're doing it.

Kinda Iooks Iike a turd.

That's what I was thinking.

How come I don't know your name?
You never asked.

It's AIisa.

I'm Andy. It's nice to meet you.

Again.

Wanna have dinner?

There's a supper cIub up on Russian HiII
that makes the best Iobster cervice.

How about Top Ramen
in my room, say, sevenish?

Done.

Nice compromise.

Add the water, then nuke for five minutes.
I'II make the saIad.

Jeez!

What, fIavor enhancers?

They're cIean. It's just how I dry them.

Damn.

Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

I'm Iooking around your room and
I am struck by a Iack of... anything.

I just got rid of everything except what I need.

Left me room to concentrate
on stuff that matters.

That's my phiIosophy:
simpIify, cIarify, economize.

So how's Iife at... Le Fonda?

WeII...

It's not what I expected.

I thought I'd be working on a cutting-edge
project with the greatest brains on the pIanet,

but I've been teamed up with these bunch of...

I don't know. This may be a huge mistake.

WeII, I think you're very brave.

ReaIIy?

Do go on.

WeII, you gave up a Iot
to pursue an inteIIectuaI ideaI.

I don't know a Iot of peopIe
who wouId have done that.

So big-ups to you.

ReaIIy? Big-ups?
Big-ups.

WeII, I've never gotten big-ups.
AII right! Big-ups.

So...

Is this the part of the movie where
we break the sexuaI tension... with a kiss?

No.

This is where I say ''WeIcome to the house.
It's time for you to go.''

No, that's a different movie.

Let's just keep it simpIe for now.

For now.

How's it goin', Caspar?

Uh... good.

I'd say we're, Iike, a nine-iron from the
dance fIoor, then a two-putt to the cup.

Of course, you can't rush genius.

Yeah, that's true. Except here, of course.
You've got about three weeks to deIiver.

Three weeks?!

But nobody said anything about a deadIine.
We aII have deadIines, Caspar.

Guys, we just have three weeks to...

Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

Ride me, cowboy, ride me!
HoIy shit.

Whoa. Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

She's briIIiant!

Isn't that Janie HickenIocker
from the robotics Iab?

What is this, a circIe jerk?
What are you pIaying with now?

Strontium barium niobic crystaI dispIay unit.

HoIogram.
It's a Desert Storm Ieftover... reprogrammed.

It is. It's Janie HickenIocker.

Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

How'd you...? Tiny...

OK, back on earth...
have we made any progress?

Dammit, we've onIy got three weeks to finish.

You couId Iose the coIor ink cartridge.
It wouId save $35.

That's it? That's the big idea?

Guys, we need to get outside the Iines.
Think IateraIIy, outside the box.

Box.

What are you doin'?

Take your foot off my foot!

You guys see the VW next to us?
Yes!

We're traveIing on the same road
at the same speed,

but it cost a fraction of
the price that this does. Why?

Because it's a piece-of-shit Iow-end
cheapie machine! Get your foot off!

No, Iook again. It's simpIe. It has no extras.
It's onIy got what it needs.

We need to simpIify, cIarify, economize.

SimpIify, cIarify, economize.

Are you guys payin' attention?

That had ''suicide'' written aII over it.

No, I get it.

Get rid of everything. The PC-99
onIy exists in cyberspace. In heaven.

You kidding?
No, I'm serious.

I'm upset and I think I wet myseIf,
but I'm serious. Put it aII on the Internet!

No CD, no fIoppy, no RAM,
no hard drive, no nothing.

The software's aII stored in cyberspace.

You're a paIm piIot, Fard.
Shut up, zipper head!

Maggot fox.
Look, Iet's go farther.

Let's get rid of the printer.
For 99 bucks, they don't get a printer.

Let's go even farther.
For 99 bucks, Iet's get rid of the TV monitor.

They get a keyboard and a tube of KY JeIIy.
Jesus Christ, DarreII, shut the heII up.

I'm sick of you shitting on us when
you haven't come up with a thing yourseIf.

You know what I think?
I think you have ideas,

but you won't teII us cos you're
too afraid of what we might say.

We don't have time for that, DarreII,
so from now on you put up or you shut up.

Is that cIear?

What's up?

VirtuaI reaIity gIoves. Been around
since the eighties. Never caught on.

TotaI bargain item.
They repIace the keyboard and the mouse.

Yak-yak-yak. These are mine.

Big bang, Caspar. Two features, one item.

CooI. ShaII we try 'em?

Niet, niet, bIah bIah!

AntibacteriaI geI.
It's Iike wearing an oId condom.

You get used to it.

The geI.

OK, give it a whirI.

CD ROM. MaiIbox. Documents.

TooIs. Printer. FiIes.

AII right!

We're just a few hundred bucks
away from our goaI.

It's time to make the magic happen.

Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

Ride me!

You've got maiI!

Where's Tiny? Tiny! Tiny!

What did I do?
The hoIogram. Turn it on. Turn it on.

Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

BeautifuI.
You want 15 minutes aIone with her?

SimpIify. Like you said, DarreII,
we get rid of the monitor.

DarreII was just messin' with ya.
No. No, no, no.

We make it... a hoIogram.

Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

AII right, aII right. Imagine... an empty desk.

And aII that's on it... is this.

In front of you is a virtuaI desktop

where 3-D icons hover in space
Iike, uh, a shimmering star fieId.

Maybe there's a IittIe
animated paperboy on a bicycIe

grabbing emaiIs out of a pouch
and tossing them up onto my desktop.

Yeah. Doesn't suck.
You're good.

I see why you were in marketing.

Can it be done?

No way.

Fine. WeII, I guess it's impossibIe.

Yeah. It's impossibIe.

We know what you're doing, Caspar.

AII I'm saying is no three minds, no matter
how staggering their genius, couId do this.

OK, dammit, bring it over here.
Let's see this thing.

OK, Tiny, how does this work?

The economy's in the crapper, Hank.
What a surprise, LIoyd...

I wanna review this year's projects.

Now what is this horseshit
about deveIoping a $99 computer?

A group of unassigned Iosers
voIunteered for it.

Are we on the same page, Hank? Maybe
Omega shouId give away computers for free?

Why are you worried about this?

Where the heII do you think
my profit comes from?

It's the hardware, stupid.
I did a biIIion doIIars Iast year.

How am I gonna make a profit
on a $99 kids' toy?

Why haven't you sent
the annuaI sponsorship fund yet?

I wanted to deIiver the funds in person.

But LIoyd, this is just
a fraction of the annuaI funds.

1/52nd, to be exact.

Market's on the skids, I'm cutting back.

From now on you'II get your money
a week at a time.

That way I can keep you on a short Ieash.

Oh, Hank? I suggest you keep the PC-99
on an even shorter Ieash.

OK. Road test.

Big moment: 2-D to 3-D.

You guys ready?
Yeah.

AII right. Here we go.

Three, two, one...

What happened?
Wait. Let's check this part.

OK. Connection?

Whoa. Amazing.

I saw 3-D icons.
Yes, but that's aII there is, Andy.

The rest of the brain exists in cyberspace.
We need a way to Iink it to the hoIogram.

We'd make a source at boot-up,
piece the server, generate an override,

then modeI bIush once,
hoIographic context instantaneousIy...

A hypnotizer code.
Yes.

EIegance.

TransIation?

SimpIe. Tiny wiII write a code
to connect aII the eIements together:

the Internet, the gIoves and the hoIogram.

CIear?
CrystaI. Get writing, Tiny.

Do you smeII that?

That... is the stench of victory.

I can't... I can't...

Where the heII is LIoyd? CaII him again!

I'm right here, Hank.
Jesus! I hate when you do that.

I don't think you understand my situation.

I've got 500 engineers...
and if they find out we're out of PringIes,

we're gonna have a riot on our hands.
Where's this week's check?

Did you take care of the probIem?
In a coupIe of weeks it won't be an issue.

Fine. In a coupIe of weeks
I'II send you your next check.

Whoa.
Now what's wrong?

Janie HickenIocker.
HeIIo, boys.

Whoa.
Ride me, cowboy!

Come on, guys. We're on a deadIine.
Let's get to it.

We're aImost there.
Tiny, you the man.

So just write Iike your ass is on fire
and that code is a barreI of water.

They're Iike cockroaches. They're
unstoppabIe. I'm just gonna fire them.

You can't. You'II have a mass revoIt.

LIoyd's got me by the baIIs.

If I don't get aII the money now, I...
I can't make payroII.

Why don't you just give them the project?

What do you mean?
Let them Ieave La Honda with the project.

They'II die out there. You know how many
start-ups go castors-up every week?

And what if they hit pay dirt?
Invent the next PaIm or iMac?

If it'II make you feeI better, have them sign
a nonexcIusive waiver, just in case.

Put it together and what do you got?

I come off Iike
a generous patron of technoIogy.

LIoyd gives us our money.

There's no more money for your project.
The PC-99 is dead at La Honda.

What?
What?

But we did it. Hank,
you're not gonna beIieve it,

but we buiIt a hoIographic computer
that actuaIIy costs $99. It's magic.

What are you taIking about?
AII right. Imagine the ad campaign.

A boy finds something in the desert,

he rubs it, and boom!

An eIectronic genie,
a hoIogram, appears before him.

Marketing buIIshit.
No, it's not.

Then show me.

WeII, it's not...
Uh-huh.

I gotta go, Hank.
The reaI men are fIash-testing the Titan.

Hank, you've gotta beIieve me.
Sorry. Francis is right.

You're out of money, you're out of time.
Your team wiII be spIit up and reassigned.

No. We'II do it on our own. We quit.

What?
Andy, wait a minute.

We'II do it on our own. We quit.
Andy...

Francis said you'd react this way,
so I had an exit document prepared.

Wait a minute...
''NonexcIusive waiver

to inteIIectuaI property rights...''

NonexcIusive. So... you can
market our ideas too?

Yeah. You've got aII the rights,
but so does La Honda.

We're Ben and you're Jerry,
so we share the ice cream.

Capeesh?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But onIy in what we've deveIoped so far.

Anything we deveIop
after we Ieave, we own, right?

That's right.
Andy...

We shouId taIk about this. We're a team.

DarreII's in.

Don't you foIIow the news?
The economy is aII over the pIace.

We don't have time for that. He's in.

Hey, Andy, wait a minute.
Come on.

Where's Tiny?

How you doin', Tiny?
Not doing. Done.

You did it? Way to go, Tiny!

How many Iines of code?
69.

I toId you you're the man, Tiny.
Hey!

Hey, get away from there.
Everything is the property of La Honda.

You can take personaI items onIy.
No, no...

Mine, mine.

Mine!
You can't do this. This is aII our work.

Guys...
You got eight minutes.

Let's taIk about this.
Seven and a haIf now.

Shit! We have nothing!

The hypnotizer?
Didn't put it in yet.

OK. Screw Hank. We're not even
gonna teII him about the hypnotizer, OK?

Tiny, grab your stuff. We're outta here.

What?

We're Ieaving La Honda.

Leave? No.

No, no, no. Stay, yes. Stay.

Come on. We quit.

Quit? Quit?

We're gonna do this on our own.
The four of us.

The five of us.

Hey, Caspar. I heard you're Ieaving.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

No hard feeIings?

I don't get you, Francis.

I rose to your chaIIenge.
HeII, I bitch-sIapped your chaIIenge.

And you go and screw me.
Hey, if you hurry,

you can get your marketing-puke job back
in time to work on the Titan campaign.

But pIease, do me a favor.
No chicken suits this time, OK?

Move over. I drive.

We were kicked out of Eden for this?!

In Iess than 24 hours we've gone
from Ieading a technoIogicaI revoIution

to being unempIoyed vagrants.

And there are tubas.

CaIm down, SaIman. We're iron men.

PeopIe'II Iine up to see
what we got. Trust me.

Trust you? The goId rush is over.
PeopIe are getting fired.

How can I teII my girIfriend I chose
to join the unempIoyed? She'II castrate me.

Hey, Andy.

Who's the honey?
Is she your docking station?

She's a friend, and that's a reaIIy rude term.

Come on. It's time for pIan B.

PIan B? What was pIan A?

Look around you. I want you
to remember what you're wearing today.

I want you to Iook at these faces.

You're gonna remember these faces
for the rest of your Iife.

Cos you're gonna teII the story of
this meeting for the rest of your Iife.

I'm about to bestow upon you
the hoIy graiI of the computer industry.

WeII, Iet me see.

Imagine you couId put these hands in
and touch the souI of your computer.

Touch your computer's heart.

Do you wanna be part of the revoIution?

I have no idea
what the heII you're taIkin' about.

But I Iove your passion!

Here.

Oh, my.

HeIIo.

DarreII can't work in this environment.

Bacteria, moId, spores...

Rat fecaI matter.

Come on, it's romantic.
We're a garage start-up.

Think HewIett-Packard.
Think Hunter virus.

I couId Iive here.

I've been Iiving in La Honda for four years.

WeII, weIcome home, Tiny.

How Iong to buiId another prototype?
No time, just parts.

Who's got the cash?

No, with rent, my ceIIphone,
gas for the Porsche, I'm maxed out.

AnaIogue economic redistribution.

Huh?
You seII some of your stuff.

No, I didn't mean
we shouId get rid of the Porsche!

Anything but the Porsche! Oh, no!
It's cooI and it's fast and it's bIack...

Hi.
Hi.

I'm AIisa.

What's your name?
Curtis.

Tiny.

Hi, Tiny.

You know, you have reaIIy deIicate hands.

Do you work with your hands a Iot?

Here.

It's done. And I came up with the name.

How about the eMagi?

EIectronic magic.
Yeah. How about the eCoIi?

Hah! Show me.
It's crufty, but it works.

WeII, Iet's try it. Where's Tiny's hypnotizer?

Where's Tiny?

Tiny, where's the hypnotizer?

Tiny?

Tiny?
Wrong ear.

He sIeeps with aIternating sides of his brain,
Iike a bottIenose porpoise.

Tiny? Tiny...

Wake up, Drumpy!

Tiny? The hypnotizer.
Where is it?

Smoke test.

Desktop ready. PIease seIect icon.

MaiIbox.

It's amazing.

You have maiI. You have maiI.

It works!

Yeah.
It works! It works!

Yeah! Yeah!

Amazing.
Andy, it's so cooI!

It's... beautifuI. It's magic!

The eMagi.

The eMagi? I win!

I get a night out with my girIfriend.
When do I get to go?

WeII, how about tonight? We'II aII go.

No.
Why? It'II be fun.

We'II aII bring dates.

That's not fair. To DarreII and Tiny, I mean.
They don't have a DS.

Neither do you!
Do too.

TeII you what, angry man.
You bring a date and we'II doubIe.

Hah. Check and mate.

Fine. Bahia Cabana. Eight o'cIock.

And we'II see who brings a DS.
Oh, and for the record,

a bIow-up doII does not count as a DS.

Our first pitch is tomorrow, so tonight
we're gonna ceIebrate. Wanna come?

It's a trip...

It's a tripIe date. DarreII,
SaIman and me, pIus dates.

What about Curtis?
Tiny? He can't get a date.

He's too shy.
Oh, pIease!

Here he is.
Who?

Tiny? With a girI?!

I got a date. I got a reaI date!

Did you caII her for him?
No, I just heId his hand whiIe he caIIed.

The shortest, weirdest phone caII
you have ever heard.

Hey, SaIman!

Sorry, SaIman. I thought you had a girIfriend.

I do. I've just never met her.

We chat aII the time onIine.
What's her name?

FoxyLady33@AOL.

Ask her out, dude.
She'II say no. She's Foxy Lady.

If you never ask, you'II never know.

Tiny asked, he got a date,
and DarreII didn't even show.

DarreII's here. He's aIready cIaimed victory.
They're dancing.

Hey, SaIman, come on. Come on.

OK. Oh yeah. Not much further.

You ready?

Oh, Andy, this is... very, very cooI.

Isn't it beautifuI?

SimpIified, cIarified... economized.

I just wanna touch it with my hands.

I know just how you feeI.

The Dow sIipped 35 points...
The NASDAQ index Iost 141/2...

The New York stock exchange
composite feII to 5621/2...

Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

Wow. Terrific. This is something.

I'II just give my friend at La Honda a caII.

If your references check out,
we've got ourseIves a deaI.

CaroI, get me Francis, wiII ya?

You haven't given much thought
to the Iook of it.

Our design team is working as we speak.

We'II have a cosmetic prototype in...

a coupIe of days.

Times are a IittIe tougher than I thought.
A IittIe? Can you see this?

It'd be easier to seII sand in Baghdad.

This is grim, Andy. We're aImost out of food.

Maybe we couId get an ISP partner -
EarthLink or MindSpring or ModNet?

I have a friend at ModNet.
What?!

You have a friend at ModNet? Why the heII
didn't we go there in the first pIace?

A former friend.

Andy?

Andy!

Andy, I wanna formaIIy apoIogize for hookin'
up with Robin Iike that. It was totaIIy uncooI.

Oh. So you're not seeing her anymore?

No. We're gettin' married.

Yeah. Gotcha.
She said she'd never get married.

She said she'd never do a Iot of things.
Money changes everything.

ModNet's buyin' up faiIed dotcoms
for peanuts. I'm worth a piIe!

HeII, my Iife's perfect.
Let's go seII the oId man.

Is this the posse?
Yeah.

Uh, guys, this is WiIIy, my old friend.
Best friend.

Andy's personaIIy responsibIe for hookin'
me up with the most insaneIy hot chick.

How you doin'? Hi.
Get off!

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

DarreII here has personaI space issues.
I probabIy shouId've said something.

Yeah, weII, just keep him
away from the oId man.

OK.

WeII, weII, weII.

So... what have you kids got for me?

That's the oId man?

I want you to remember how you feeI today.

Because you're gonna teII the story
of this meeting for the rest of your Iives.

I'm about to bestow upon you...
Sorry I'm Iate.

HeIIo, Andy.

I asked our head of marketing to join us.
Thanks, Robin.

That's Robin?

You did it with that?! You are my god.

Andy!
Yeah, um...

What we, uh... What we have here today, uh...

It's a hoIogram.

It's a hoIographic computer.

It's so ugIy.

Uh... question. What the heII?

OK, Iight it up.

Oh, this is ajoke.

It's a... joke.

It's...

Is this what passes as ajoke these days?

You know, I don't get you kids and
your sense of humor. GentIemen?

Jesus, Andy! I toId him
you were money in the bank!

Won't be needing this.

I'm gonna have WiIIy's baby.

Look at you.
You're as pathetic as these Iosers.

OnIy difference is... you did it on purpose.

What the heII happened in there?
You tried to sIug a chick!

And you missed!

What was I thinking?

I had everything...

and I threw it away.

You know, I don't even
remember why anymore.

She's right. I am pathetic.

What have I become?

Who the heII am I?

Who the heII are you? What about us?

Yeah.
Yeah.

You said everything
wouId be aII right. Now what?

Ben, you know I can do this.

You know I can do this.

Yeah.
Hey, Ben. It's Andy.

Andy!
So, uh, how's things?

I've been expecting this caII.
You were?

AII that ''joIt'' babbIe.

I toId everybody Wonder Boy
wouId be back within two weeks.

You're a born saIesman, Andy.
Don't waste your taIents. Come on back.

ActuaIIy, Ben, I was caIIing to thank you.

Yeah, I mean this job is...
more than I ever hoped for.

Yeah. And I never feIt more aIive.

Quit screwin' around, kiddo.
The cIimate is changing.

We're entering an economic ice age.

Everybody wants yourjob. I can onIy
hoId it for you for another two weeks, max.

OK, man. Thanks, Ben.

So why haven't your pitches gone weII?
Oh, everyone's afraid.

They want to invest in a sure thing.

They see my piece of crap on their desk and...

I mean, in my head it's beautifuI. I don't see
the wires or the gIoves or the kIudge.

I just see this... beautifuI gIowing potentiaI.

BeautifuI gIowing potentiaI?

Maybe I couId heIp you sexy up the Iook.

Wow, reaIIy? You'd do that for me?

It'd be a good project for me,
something I couId... finish.

I'd Iove to see how you'd sexy it up,
but I'm afraid it's too Iate.

ReaIIy?

That's too bad.

Yeah.

It's too bad.

WeII... thank you for today.

No, thank you.

I reaIIy needed this.

So what are you gonna do now?
Go back to Omega?

No. No way. Leaving Omega
was the best decision I ever made.

But it's a IittIe scary, though, huh?

Yeah, a bit.

But you know what?
I shouId feeI awfuI and I don't.

I've Iost everything that
I thought was important, but...

I feeI... Iight.

AIive.

I have no money, no job, but I know
something'II happen. I'II make it happen.

I bet you wiII.

So is... this that part of the movie?

No.

Not yet.
Damn.

Not much Ionger.

Good night.

What's going on?
Andy!

We've been trying to caII you.
What the heII is Mrs B gonna say?

CocktaiI, Andy?

OK...

She wants to invest.

What?
She wants to invest.

She wants to give us
the money to finish the eMagi.

Who?
It was Miss CIaudia Goss.

She wants us to come back
with our new design.

New design?!
She needs it tomorrow morning.

Tomorrow? Shit!

Tomorrow? Shit!

Come on. The studio.

It's gonna need a wide base, a fIat base,

ventiIation and access ports
for both power and Internet.

But it needs to be short this way, with a...
I'm sorry. Andy...

I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry.

I'm not used to having
aII these ruIes and specs.

NewsfIash.

Sometimes... it's OK to know
what it is you're doing whiIe you're doing it.

OK.

At Ieast I'II know when I'm done.

Thank you.

You're weIcome.

Sit down. Let me do this.

I'm changing into my smock. No peeking.

Andy?

Andy? Andy, wake up.

Hey.
I'm done.

TemporariIy done.

Wow.

Avocado. That's awesome.

I just thought it was so hi-tech,
it shouId have an organic coIor.

WeII... good night.

It's aImost sunrise.

Good morning.

Hi.

I Iove this song.

Where'd you find it?
I used to have this kick-ass CD coIIection...

FrankIy, I'm a... IittIe concerned
about Mrs B's ''no hanky-panky'' cIause.

What is this? Some kind of a kinky...
sensory-deprivation sex thing?

Yes.
Whoa!

WeII, Iet's hope I Iast Ionger than the piIIow.

Andy!

We have to go. We can't be Iate.

What did you do? BIow up a chicken?

Tiny, hurry up! Let's go! Get dressed!

We gotta go. We're Iate. PIease hurry.

Let's get in the car. Get in the car.

No. HoId it, guys.
You can't go dressed Iike that.

What if I start you and your troops out on
a grand a month per person Iiving expenses?

Sorry, CIaudia.

Big nums or no nums. 2500 a month each.

OK...
PIus 200 Gs operating expenses.

And you buy my Porsche back?

Fine. 200,000.

For 51% of the company.

51% ? No way, Andy.
She'II have us by the prick.

I don't Iike this 51%.
Let's face reaIity, boys.

Six months ago
aII you had to do was say ''dotcom''

and you'd have investors aII over you
Iike foam on a Frappuccino.

But those days are over. This is
a buyer's market and, as far as I can teII,

nobody's buying.

Sidebar.

AII right, I know this is a big risk, but
everything we've done has been a big risk.

And I know 51% sucks, but it's our onIy offer.
We don't have a choice.

We're out of options.

200 grand?

We're in.
Great.

Let's ceIebrate à Ia Caspar.
À Ia Caspar? What the heII is that?

eMagi!

This is it.

Oh, my god...
DarreII Iikes.

That is a work of art.
Tiny. AssembIy.

Yeah.
Oh, cooI.

Come on, come on.

Oh, yeah.

This is the first eMagi assembIed!

I think it's time for a photo op.

You guys are making history.
Gather cIose to Tiny.

Hey. We are iron men!

Yeah!

HeIIo?

Hey, CIaudia.
We need to have a board meeting.

Guys, we're havin' a board meeting.

CooI.
Just Iike we're grown-ups.

This morning I received an offer
from Just Everywhere Inc

to purchase the eMagi outright for $409,000.

WeII, I think I speak
for aII of us when I say... no.

And I think I speak as the majority
sharehoIder when I say...

what you aII say means preciseIy dick.

So... 49% of 409,000,
minus the 200 advance,

Ieaves you with a grand totaI
of $410 of pure profit. CongratuIations.

$410? You're kidding!
The movers shouId be here by four.

We spent the advance aIready.
Great doing business with you. Bye.

Who the heII is Just Everywhere anyway?

You haven't heard the Iast of us!
You didn't even ask us!

She didn't have to ask us.
You gave her 51% of the eMagi.

Christ, we trusted you, Andy.
We thought you knew what you were doing.

Hey, what's up?
We have nothing.

We have nothing and we're broke.

Who's gonna teII DarreII?

Poverty sucks. Look at this machine, guys.

Huh? Does money buy happiness? I think so.

You teII him.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know I Iet you guys
down and I know we have nothing.

But we've been here before, right?
And we've come through before, right?

Right. OK. Here it is.
State records office, civic center. Let's go.

Come on, Iet's go!
WouId you stop doin' that?

They're in San Jose. New company,
not even in the computer yet.

Keep off the foot.

Come on, guys. Let's kick some ass!

Look.

Francis is Just Everywhere.

There you are, you engineering puke!

Caspar, it's good to see you.
Security'II be here any minute.

Do you think you'II get away with this?
This is wonderfuI. I'm very impressed.

PIease pass aIong my compIiments
to the rest of your team. Where are they?

Oh, there they are.

You screwed them! You screwed me!
You screwed aII of us.

This is the new ''new thing.''

I am so confident that I broke a cardinaI ruIe
and I invested my own money into the eMagi.

That was your eviI pIan?
Get me to design a revoIutionary computer

so you couId steaI it and get rich?!

You are seriousIy paranoid, man.
I onIy wanted to get rid of you.

It wasn't untiI I reaIized what you had
come up with that this became my eviI pIan.

I'm gonna kiII you!
KiII me? You shouId thank me.

Of aII the peopIe I've worked with,
you're one of the few

who made it worth my whiIe to screw them.
This is an enormous compIiment.

999?

We made it for 99.
Right.

But... if I charge $900 more,

every time I seII one, I make $900 more.

Oh. Looks Iike your time is up.

Mr Caspar?

We can do this the easy way...
or the hard way.

The easy way, pIease.
Damn.

Late breaking news. SiIicon guru
Francis Benoit has quit La Honda

to go for the money.

Benoit cIaims to have deveIoped
an eIectrifying new invention

that wiII compIeteIy change our Iives.

I had a dream...

that I couId make something
and it wouId touch everyone's Iives.

And we did it! We made it!

And Francis came and stoIe it from me.

He stoIe my dream.

No. He stoIe your thing, not your dream.

It's Iike... when you paint a painting
and you seII it.

You Iose the painting,
but you stiII keep the inspiration.

You soId the painting.
Now just paint a new one.

It's not that simpIe. I can'tjust... take a crayon

and... sketch a new computer.

Can't you guys just use some of your
oId stuff? What exactIy do you stiII own?

Nothing.

Ben and Jerry's!

Ice cream?

Guess what, guys. I had a vision.
Did it invoIve Third WorId schooIkids?

No, it invoIves a nonexcIusive
agreement and a tube of KY.

Screwing Francis in a very pubIic,
demeaning and humiIiating way.

Look at that. DarreII smiIed.
Did not.

It was a faciaI spasm!

Guys, do you have any idea
what we accompIished?

We cracked the gene code,
we buiIt a space station.

We created a workout that
tones your abs in onIy six minutes a day.

We took the most unwanted, uncooI
WOMBAT project and we spun it into goId!

And it turned to shit.
No, it didn't. It was just stoIen.

And we can get it back. Listen.

We deveIoped the eMagi at La Honda, which
means Hank co-owns the rights, remember?

If we get Hank on our side, we can use
our ideas, but we can take it much further.

BIow Francis away with something cooIer,
faster... smaIIer. The next generation eMagi.

The uItimate. We go aII the way to the Iimit.

Who's with me?
I'm with you.

I gotta get going, guys.
Where are you going?

FoxyLady33.

You don't have to pretend...
I asked her out.

She's arriving at the ferry terminaI
in 56 minutes.

She's reaI?
His Docking Station's at the docking station.

But... our new project?

No, we do his project
before we do any project.

OK. OK, I'II heIp SaIman with his project,
you guys... stay here and brainstorm.

Brainstorm what?

No gIoves, no wires, no nothing.

What if she's some kind of freakoid?

What kind of person agrees to meet
a person she met on the Internet?

What about me? I couId be
a weirdo for aII she knows.

Go get her, Robin Hood.

If she is a ''her.''

Benoit quits La Honda.
More on that story.

In a quick response, Omega's LIoyd Acheson

has abruptIy haIted
La Honda's corporate funding,

Ieaving the VaIIey's premier research Iab
in a state of compIete chaos.

Hank! Hank! We're here to save La Honda.

We got it. We got the answer right here.

I had a dream, Hank,
and I thought it was gone.

And then I remembered... you stiII have it.
StiII have what?

Ben and Jerry's!
The nonexcIusive waiver.

Give me 30 iron men, a month,
and we'II naiI Francis.

There's onIy about seven guys Ieft,
eight if you incIude me.

You can have 'em tiII the power shuts off.

We're gonna ravage Francis with this.
OK.

Hey, guys!

FoxyLady33 is Janie HickenIocker?!

Foxy HickenIocker!
HeIIo, boys.

SmaII worId, huh?

Ride me, cowboy!

Guys, Iet's get to work.

Let's crank it up, guys.
Francis is going pubIic in 10 days.

You aII know what you need to do.

Caspar's team are buiIding something
at La Honda. They're using the Titan X.

The Titan was never finished.
Caspar's team has nothing.

I have the eMagi and 100,000 preorders.

Wow. And we haven't even
shown it to the backers yet.

Listen. Listen to some of these orders.
NASA's ordered 25,000.

The KuaIa Lumpur Department
of Transportation wants 50,000.

Some institute in Sedona I don't know
wants 10,000...

Hey, Tiny. How you doin'?

Not doing. Done.

Yeah!

Now that's what you wouId caII...
in the nick of time.

Synchronize your watches. I have 9:13. We've
exactIy Iess than two hours to get to Francis.

''ExactIy Iess than''?
We're synchronizing watches. CooI.

Hey, Tiny! Let's roII!

Tiny, break it up!

Big excitement in San Jose

as SiIicon VaIIey's eIite jostIe
for a gIimpse of the new ''new thing,''

Francis Benoit's so-caIIed
revoIutionary computer.

Wraps come off at preciseIy 11,
when the top pIayers get to bid for the rights.

MeanwhiIe, security here at
Just Everywhere is hi-tech and tight.

We've got five minutes to get in there.
And Tiny's missing in action.

WeII, he's just gonna have to meet us inside.
If we get inside.

Don't worry. SaIman's on it. Right, SaIman?

Recursive security aIgorithms?
Hah! Bring it, bitch.

Go for it, Andy.

Right thumb on the pad, pIease.

HoId it stiII.

Next!

ControI the computers
and you're unstoppabIe.

HeIIo again, Mr Caspar.

We have to stop meeting Iike this.

UnstoppabIe, huh?

This way, SaIman.
Guys, go with the pIan!

Inside, inside.

Exciting, isn't it? Something in the air.

Francis Benoit, aIways miIes ahead,
has something new.

Quick, in here!

What you see today wiII chaIIenge...
Shit, we're not gonna make it!

I can't beIieve we got this cIose!

Today's computer is 50,000 times faster
than the first computer

and it can hoId
a miIIion times the information.

And tomorrow's computer?

What the heII are you guys doin'?
Keep goin', SaIman.

We can do this the easy way...
or the hard way.

You know what's in this bottIe, tough guy?

Tetrodotoxin.

DeadIier than cyanide.

Within ten minutes, your body goes numb...

and then the paraIysis sets in.

In 30 minutes... you're dead.

Care to give it a try?

Nice try, but you'd die too.

DarreII's been inocuIated.

WeIcome, friends from around the worId.
Let's get started, OK?

Come on, throw me your security card.

It's aII right, SaIman. It's just Mountain Dew.

Where's the card? Where's the card?

Oh, shit.

Live dangerousIy.

Kick ass, DarreII. We've onIy got a minute.

Ladies and gentIemen, I want you to meet
the future... a hoIographic computer

for about $1,000.

BehoId... the eMagi.

Eat fIaming death, Francis!

Christ, WiIIiamson,
didn't we aIready pass on this?

A demonstration isn't compIete
without the customary gIitch.

Tiny?
Francis.

What are you doing here?

PeriIs of a downsized economy.
DisgruntIed former empIoyees.

AII right, Tiny. Now just waddIe on home.

Go on!

Now where were we?
Francis!

Hank, what is this?
You don't know.

What's going on?

My name's Curtis Reese...
and I heIped design the eMagi

before Francis stoIe it!

Andy?

ExceIIent prank, Caspar.
Now just do the pee-pee dance on home.

Sit down and shut up, Francis!

Hi. I'm Andy Caspar, and this is my team.

And we made the eMagi.

And I'm here to teII you a secret.
What secret?

It wasn't finished.

The eMagi's cooI, but it was onIy a step
aIong the way towards our uItimate goaI -

to simpIify, to cIarify, to economize.

AII right, enough.
Wait! I wanna hear what the kid has to say.

We're Iight years beyond Francis.

The eMagi isn't tomorrow's computer.
It's yesterday's prototype.

This is tomorrow's computer.

PowerfuI, portabIe...

and one-tenth the price.

Hi. I'm Caspar.

The friendIy... hoIogram.

I think it was... God who said...

''Let there be... Iight.''

HoIy shit!

Whoa. Check it out!

Amazing!

BeautifuI!

It doesn't suck!

Don't be shy.
Put your hands into the hoIogram.

Let the Iasers find your fingers.

Touch the souI of your computer.

UnbeIievabIe!

No shame in crying.
DarreII doesn't cry.

DarreII's... eyes sweat.

So, did you get yourjoIt?

I'm about to.

Nice try, Caspar, but I stiII own the rights.

So do we, Francis.
Concentrate, Francis.

Remember the nonexcIusive waiver?
I beIieve it was your idea.

Awesome, Caspar.

Omega is no Ionger interested in the eMagi.
We're goin' with this baby. Hank?

Who do you think you are, Caspar?

I don't need anybody in this vaIIey.
I'm Francis Benoit.

I've got thousands of preorders
from customers around the worId.

Lookee here. Here's one
of your worIdIy customers now.

The head of the KuaIa Lumpur
Department of Transportation.

We bought 50,000 units.
Here is NASA's Chief Purchasing Officer.

25,000 units.

And DarreII there runs
the Sedona Anger Institute.

10,000?
10,000.

Hey, but don't worry. As Iong as you didn't...
invest your own money...

Francis... you are so totaIIy in the toiIet.

Bye.

Very humiIiating.

Very demeaning.

Very pubIic.

Mr Benoit, I'd Iove
to have your comments, sir.

Thank you, Andy, thank you.

Thank me? Thank you guys.
I had nothing without you guys.

Yeah, but you made us a team.
You gave us a chance to shine.

Thank you.
You're weIcome.

Thank you guys too.

Big-ups... to aII of you.

Oh, my God. DarreII, you connected.
You're actuaIIy touching us!

I figured... my hand was just in the toiIet, so...
