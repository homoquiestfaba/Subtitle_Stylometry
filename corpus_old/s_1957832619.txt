(Jenny sighs)


My father would say,
"Start with history."

But do you start at
the beginning of time

or just current events?

Anywhere in the world,

or just at home?

Our nation is the enduring dream

of every immigrant who ever
set foot on these shores

and the millions still
struggling to be free.

This is a great contest
between hope and fear.

This is a contest between
unity and division.

A contest between
the courage to change

and the comfort
of the status quo.

We are looking on the edge
of a revolution of young people

who are starting to realize
that we, our generation,

put them four trillion in debt

and they don't like
it and they shouldn't.

My name is Anita F. Hill.

I was scared and I was alone.

Can we all just get along?

Can we get along?

(tape rewinding)
(intense punk music)

start with my story.

(intense punk music)

So...

Why Harvard?

When I was nine years old,
I visited Harvard with my dad.

I remember standing
in the Harvard Yard

and seeing all the fall colors.

It was like something
out of the movies.

I remember everybody there
seemed so important, so serious,

and that my dad was one of them.

It was like the
best of the best.

And that's when I realized
that I wanted to be one, too.

(students chattering)

Hey, girl.
Hey.

Let me see this.

Uh, what asshole put
AP chem first period?

I know, I'm gonna die.
Oh my God.

How was your summer?

It was fun. I
hung out with Drea.

Oh, good.

Hola, chica.

What is on the menu for today?

I actually have AP
chem first period.

Oh my gosh.

Same! We can be study buddies.

Owen, I've known you
since freshman year.

We both know you don't study.

Oh.

You hurt me.

Kelly Norman, what's up?

Owen Riley, color me surprised.

(Owen chuckles)

(bell rings)

Well, enjoy your
ridiculous science.

I'll see you in English.

Ready for chemistry?

welcome to the wonderful world

that I like to
call AP chemistry.

The wonderful world of AP chem.

So what are you looking
forward to this school year?

What I'm really
looking forward to

is this year's election.


Because I'll be 18 in time.

Have you been
following the coverage?

Oh yeah.

When Ross Perot dropped out in
July, I couldn't believe it.

Was he the candidate you
were going to vote for?

Oh, no.

But it made everything
so much more interesting

with his third party run.

Let's sort of do a quick summary

of what we discussed before
in terms of where we are,

then we'll go to the solution.

I've offered a
comprehensive plan.

And my agenda for
American renewal,

an integrated, comprehensive
set of answers.

We're going to ask the
rich to pay their fair share

so the rest of America
can finally get a break.

I wish it were that
easy, but it is not.

And it will take new solutions,
comprehensive solutions...

Since we're dealing
with voodoo economics,

a great young lady from
Louisiana sent me this voodoo stick

and I will use it as
my pointer tonight.

Why is this an important
year in US history?

It's the year of the election.

Why is this an
important election?

it's the President.

(students laughing)

This is the first
presidential election

since the fall of the Soviet
Union, the end of the Cold War,

followed by a brief
but controversial

Gulf War in the Middle East.

Last year, a man was
pulled from his truck

and beaten by cops.

This spring, the
officers were acquitted,

sparking riots that
lasted for days.

We're in an economic downturn.

What is the temperature
of the country right now?

This year is touted as
the year of the woman.

There are how many
female candidates

on the ballot in November?

How many of you will
be old enough to vote?

Congratulations, it is
an honor and a right.

This is one of the foremost

pieces of literature
in the world,

quoted and analyzed to death,

and you will do the same.

I need four volunteers
to read act one.

Mr. Riley, how lovely to
have you in my class, again.

Always a pleasure.

Mm-hm.

All right.

Okay, you three young ladies,
please open your books.

Ms. Johnson, how
was your summer?

It was fun.

Thank you, how about yours?

Short.

Yeah.

I'm applying early
decision to Harvard

and I would appreciate
some help on my essay.

Well, when you have a draft,
we'll schedule some time.

Tell me something I can't
read in your application.

Who are you?

What are the things
that make you, you?

Movies, books,
television, music.

Everyone who applies for
Harvard has an excellent GPA,

is overloaded with
extracurriculars,

and some are legacies
like yourself.

What makes you stand out?

So tell us about your interview.

It was okay.

You tell him about your 4.0,

your literary magazine,
all your classes?

Oh mom, the mole is so good.

Mm-hm.



(Camelia chuckles)

sign up for the SAT again.

But I did so well.

Statistics show
that students score

at least 100 points better
the second time around.


Then a 1560 would get you

closer to a perfect
score, won't it?

was your day, Jack?

Upper management...

Came up with some new nonsense

and everybody nods
their head and says,

"Yes please, I want some more."

Like lambs to a slaughter.

Maybe you should do
something fun this weekend.

You know, go see a movie.

Go for a bike ride.


Who am I?

Who am I?




Do you ever feel like there's
a black hole inside of you?

(intense punk rock music)

The music fills me up,
but sometimes I wonder...

â™ª Oh, traitor traitor â™ª

Maybe I want to get sucked in.

â™ª Whoa, traitor traitor â™ª

â™ª Whoa, traitor traitor
traitor traitor â™ª

â™ª Whoa, yeah â™ª

â™ª Whoa oh oh â™ª

â™ª Whoa oh oh â™ª

Oh, open. Oh, sorry.

Dad stop.

What?
Stop.

What?
No, stop.

Oh, that would've...

If you would've
just opened your...

Okay.
You could have had that.

No, no, no, no, no.

(Jenny laughs)

Oh, you almost caught that.

Okay, open up quick, sorry.

Gosh.
What are you laughing at?

Okay.
Stop.

Oh, you weren't ready,
I'm sorry, my bad.

Ah, I'm not good at it.

So what are you
reading in English?

Hamlet.

Oh.

"To thine own self be true."

Haven't gotten to that part yet.

Polonius.

Good advice.

(Jenny sighs)

So define gregarious.
Dad.

Come on, gregarious, gregarious.

Come on, you got this.

Maybe I should
just take a gap year.

(Jack chokes)
(Jack coughs)

Over my dead body.

Dad, I'm kidding.

I mean, I've been thinking
of Harvard for forever.

(grand orchestral music)

(Jack seal barking)

(grand orchestral music)

I'm heading off to Drea's.

Dad?

You have a good time
at Andrea's, okay?

You say hello to
her mother for me.

(intense punk music)

No, no take that off.

Yeah.

(intense punk rock music)

â™ª To play this way,
look up in the sky â™ª

â™ª Can't you see,
we're all gonna die â™ª

â™ª The world's corrupt,
but will they join â™ª

â™ª We have the power
but what's going on â™ª

â™ª Wake up, hold the fight â™ª

â™ª Wake up â™ª

â™ª We're still all right â™ª

(people chattering)
(muted punk music)

[Lead Singer] Hey
everyone, we're Giant Kitty,

and we want girls to the front!

(upbeat punk music)

All right boys, you heard
what I said, move along.

â™ª I like to wear it â™ª

â™ª In my hair â™ª

â™ª It keeps things
all too well there â™ª

â™ª It clips back my bangs â™ª

â™ª To show my pretty face â™ª

â™ª But now and then I
feel out of place â™ª

â™ª Yeah him beggin' â™ª

â™ª I'll catch you fading â™ª

â™ª Once more my fascinator â™ª

(crowd cheering)

Yes.

What's up, J?

Owen, what are you doin' here?

Owen, Aaron, this is Drea.

We actually used go
to school together.

Hey.

Would you like a sip?

How did you even get this?

(Owen laughs)

Aaron.

You're running, you're

Faster than you've

Faster, faster,

So, what are we up to next?

What is he seeing?

You want to see for yourself?

Are you kidding me?

There's more than enough.

You're welcome to a tab.

Um, I'm straight-edge by choice.

Oh.

And you, J?

Hey, what is up with you?
Who the hell is that guy?

He's just a kid from my school.

Come on. Would it be bad

Oh, what if he tries something

(intense punk rock music)


gave me a heart attack.

I'm sorry, I had all these
thoughts going through my head.

I just needed to
get some fresh air.

So how are you feeling?

Amazing.

Thank you.

(Jenny laughs)

I thought you were
cool with how you are.

(tense music)

Maybe.


I'm straight-edge by choice.


(Drea clapping)

Wakey, wakey!

You guys got to get out

before my mom gets
home from her shift.

(Owen sighs)


Running through the forest.

Faster than you've

Faster, faster,

(water running)

(Jenny sighs)

Hey.

Want to go grab some grub?

I can't.

My family has this whole thing

where we eat breakfast
together on the weekends.

Nice.
Mm-hm.

Out.

Out, get out.

See you guys later.

But, I'll see you at school.

Bye.

First time I have
the opportunity

to go to the Republican
National Convention,

it's here in Houston, I'm
not even sure I want to go.

Bush is talking about
all this new policy,

this new attitude.

Well, I already
know his attitude.

them to notice something.

I wonder if I looked
different somehow.

If they would be able to tell.

(upbeat punk music)


Well, I know where
his money comes from.

(Jack seal barking)

So...

I'm interested in...

(Camelia speaking
in foreign language)

What are you doing?
Hey.

(Camelia speaking in Spanish)

Mom, why did you
never teach us Spanish?

Um, they say it's harder

for bilingual children
to learn in school.

Does dad know Spanish?

(Camelia laughs)

When I first heard his accent,

I told your father never
to speak Spanish again.

Did he ever, did he
ever try to learn for you?

Mija, I wanted to leave Mexico.

I wanted to be an American.

You could teach me.

Or, you can put up your laundry.

Ross Perot jumps
back into the race.

into the Presidential race

and Bill Clinton.

States have asked me to run

as a candidate for President
of the United States.

(upbeat punk rock music)

Hey, how's this look?

Yeah.
Yeah, yeah?

Look at this.
(Drea gasps)

Yes?
Yes, yes!

Okay, I have to
leave it here, though.

Oh yeah yeah, that's fine.

Hey, you know what will
look good with that?

What?

Since your birthday
is Wednesday,

I wanted to give you your
present early for tonight.

Oh, don't freak
out, they're used.

They're amazing!
(Drea chuckles)

(Jenny and Drea squeal)

(upbeat punk rock music)

(Miss Tran speaking
in Vietnamese)

What?

So what?

That's what they think of us.

It's nice to see you, Jenny.

Tell your parents I said hello.

I will, Miss Tran.

You okay?

Ugh.

Talk to me about the patriarchy.

Okay.

(Jenny sighs)

"Because us girls
crave the records

and books and fanzines
that speak to us,

we feel included in and can
understand in our own ways,

to make it easier

each other's work."

Scoot over.
Oh?

(Jenny sighs)

I can't believe in five
days I'm gonna be 18.

I could just do something that
I couldn't do the day before.

Oh, you should
buy lottery tickets.

Oh, and cigarettes. (chuckles)

You already dropped
acid like a crazy person.

Exactly.

(Drea sighs)

I can get a job.

I could get real arrested.
No.

I can get married.
(Drea chuckles)

I am never getting married.
Yeah.

Before our last song,

I wanted to let you
know that I lost

a very good friend
of mine this week.

She lived through
the pain and shame

of an abusive relationship.

Jesse, this one's for you.

â™ª Draw my eyes to yours â™ª

â™ª Draw my eyes to yours â™ª

â™ª What's between my ears â™ª

â™ª What is it good for â™ª

â™ª What's between my legs â™ª

â™ª What is it good for â™ª

â™ª Assess me â™ª

â™ª I come up short â™ª

â™ª Undress me â™ª

â™ª It won't take much work â™ª

â™ª Deduce me â™ª

â™ª I read like a book â™ª

But, you told me

Uh, it is awesome.

Okay.
Okay, okay.

awesome it'll be again.

Oh, so awesome.

Yay!

don't move, don't move.

Okay, sorry.

Okay.
Okay.

(girls laughing)

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

Okay.
Okay.

Okay.
Okay.

were going to UT with me.

That's assuming I'll get in.
You'll get in.

Mm, and if not, then
community college.

Apply again in a year or two.

Probably not a bad idea anyways.

It would be so much cheaper.

I don't, I don't
even have a plan B.

Uh well, duh, you're
going to Harvard.

Yeah, but I don't know.

I never even thought of like,
what if I don't go to Harvard?

It doesn't matter.

You'll get in.

I'll go to UT and
I'll get financial aid

and maybe a scholarship or four.

You know, I'm the
one who has to stick

with the stay in school and
don't get pregnant plan.

You can do whatever you want.

Fuck the plan.

Eh, I can't get pregnant,
or do any, you know what?

I'm not. I'm a bad Riot Grrrl.

(Drea laughs)

Don't make me laugh.

(upbeat punk rock music)

I think it looks
pretty, and cool.

â™ª You're my friend,
but you suck â™ª

I love it!

(girls squealing)

Oh my God, your parents...

Hey, quit it.
(Jenny chuckles)

Whoa, what happened?


(game music blaring)

You made me die!
Oh whatever, that was you.

(controller smacks)

Ah!
Shit.

(Camelia speaking in Spanish)


(Jenny sighs)

Shit.

You should probably
hold his head down.

Que pasÃ³!

I just needed a change.

You look like a boy.

(Camelia sighs)

I'm starving, is
the food ready yet?

What happened buddy?

What happened?

It was an accident.

Cutting your hair
was an accident?

What? No, I just
needed a change.

What kind of impression
is this gonna make?

It's a haircut.
You look like a lesbian.

(Jenny scoffs)

You don't have permission
to mutilate your body.

I didn't.

It's hair.

It's my hair, it's my body.
I can do whatever I want.

What's gotten into you?

Nothing has gotten into
me, I'm just sick and-

Go to your room.


You know what? Whatever,
I'm going back to Drea's.

Wait. (hand grasps)

(body thuds)

(tense music)

I just want to go to my room.

Is that okay with you?

(Jenny sighs)

(soft tense music)

â™ª Don't flinch, don't cry â™ª

â™ª Don't burn dinner,
don't make any noise â™ª

â™ª Don't hate when he's around â™ª

â™ª Don't tell anyone â™ª

â™ª Your brain is broken
and he will fix it â™ª

â™ª Remember his version
of the truth today â™ª

â™ª Keep eye contact, don't
make the wrong face â™ª

â™ª Can't say I didn't try â™ª

â™ª Don't burn dinner,
don't make any noise â™ª

â™ª Can't say I didn't try â™ª

â™ª Your brain is broken
and he will fix it â™ª

â™ª Remember his version
of the truth today â™ª

â™ª You can't say I didn't try â™ª

You should apologize.

Apologize for what? He's
acting like an asshole.

Jennifer.

What is this?

It's nothing, Mom.

(Camelia sighs)

Come with me.

(soft music)

I don't understand.

Your father doesn't believe

so he did not want you to
be raised in the faith.

But, I baptized you myself
when you were babies.

Who cares about what dad says?

You are so lucky.

My father didn't like
for me to go to school.

Even my own mother thought I
should simply learn cooking

and taking care of the
house, but I wanted to go.

I wanted to learn.

I wanted to be a doctor.

Really?
Mm-hm.

But my grades
weren't good enough.

And without the
support of my family...

Eh.

But your father, he works very
hard to give you the best.

You should trust him to
know what's best for you.

Whenever I have a problem or
a worry I come here and I sit.

And pray?

To God?

Mm-hm.

(soft music)

Mijo no, you must say a prayer
for each candle you light.

Who do you light a candle for?

My family.

In Mexico?

And you and Michael,
and your father.

Say a prayer, light a candle.

For what?

That is up to you.

(pensive music)

(Jenny sighs)

(pensive music)

(Jenny sighs)

Miss Johnson.

Did you take every
pamphlet we have out?

Oh dear, what happened to
Harvard early decision?

That's still the plan.

Just wanted to see what
else was out there.

What are you planning
on majoring in?

My dad says to
keep my options open,

excel in every subject
and decide in college.

Is that what you think?

Well, see, I'm
good at every subject

so that's not really
that big of a deal,

but the only subject that
I really love is English.

Well, brown-nosing me isn't
going to get you anywhere.

I'm serious, I do.

I love the words, the
imagination, the impact but,

like what career do
you make out of this?

Like a writer?

Teacher?

Tell me about the haircut.

It's just a haircut.

Not many people would
make such a radical change.

Well, I'm still me.

Just wanted to try something
new, something different.

Is that important to you?

Trying something new, different?

Hm, we have big universities,

small liberal arts
colleges, Midwest,

East Coast, California,
Reed College.

I like the
nontraditional structure.

[Miss Johnson] Do you now?

I don't know.

I just...

I don't know.

It just feels like any and
everything is interesting. Ah.

Well, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

Doesn't really matter
where you go to college.

What matters is what you
do when you get there

and what you do when you leave.

Who you become in the process.

How's the essay coming along?

How am I even supposed
to know what to write about

if I can't even figure
out where to apply to?

Oh, that's the easy part.

It's called a personal
statement for a reason,

because it's personal
and it's a statement.

Kinda like that haircut.

(inquisitive music)


Just needed something different.

It's soft.

You don't think
I look like a dyke?

You're still gorgeous, if
that's what you're asking.

Are you telling
me you like girls?

(Jenny laughs)

What do you do when everything
just seems to be too much?

Any and all mood
enhancing substances.

Not the biggest fan of alcohol,
but it'll do in a pinch.

How do you function
at this school?

I have a genius IQ,
a State Rep father,

and a mother on
the school board.

I just, I just need to get
out of my head, you know?

I don't have anything on me
right now, too bad, so sad.

But, there are other ways
of getting out of your head.

Mr. Riley.

Miss Johnson.

Control yourselves, or I
will have to write you up.

(Owen and Jenny laugh)

(phone ringing)


"Hamlet: Is this is a
prologue or the posy of a ring?

(tense music)

(woman speaking in Spanish)

(Camelia speaks in Spanish)

hell just happened?

(distorted chattering)

What the hell just happened?

How am I supposed ever
figure out who I am

if I don't even know
where I came from?

Welcome to adulthood.

(singing in Spanish)

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday, dear Jenny â™ª

(singing in Spanish)

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

Happy birthday mija!
Thank you.

I made your favorite
for dinner tonight.

Tamales?

Yes.
Yeah!

Happy birthday.

Okay, no, no.
Ah.

Okay, I guess.

You're gonna wear this.
You're officially an adult now.

Oh my gosh don't say
that. Don't say that.

Are you excited?

Everybody make sure
you've got your goggles on.

Now, if it's acidic,

what color should the
litmus paper turn?

Mr. Richards?


You got it.

Now let's see if all of you
can get that same result.

Cool.

(Owen gasps)

It's acid.

Stop, you'll poison
yourself one of these days.

Most drugs are
laced with something.

Jesus Christ, now I'm
gonna think about it

the next time I do it.

Next time?

Yeah.

Also, why are you doing
all the work? Here.

Pipette, enjoy.

Me gusta mucho tamales.

Gracias madre.

Bravo.

(insects buzzing
in the distance)

So, Dad, how was your day?

Long.

You want to go see
a movie this weekend?

Yeah, sure.

What's out?

I don't know.

But I heard that there's
this new theater policy.

No barking like a seal.

(Jack chuckles)

(Jack seal barking)

(all chuckling)

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday dear Jenny â™ª

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

(Camelia clapping)


What'd you wish for?

I'm not telling you.
(Camelia chuckles)

(soft music)

new dress for the holidays.

Hey, what do you say?

Gracias, Madre.

De nada.

Happy birthday.

(tense music)

(women cheering)

Oh my gosh, I only
get these things here.

I like your hair.

I had a similar cut
when I was young.

Really? In Vietnam?

My daughter, she lucky
to know you as a friend.

Going to Harvard.

You can learn so much from her.

(Drea scoffs)

I got to get to work.

(Drea laughs)

I love my mom, I do.

And I feel like an asshole

because I know how much
she sacrificed but,

sometimes I just
want a mom, you know?

Someone to make me waffles
and tell me to go to bed.

Someone to wake me
up if I've overslept

and drive me to school.

She's a survivor.

She's like the fucking
toughest person I know.

But as soon as my brother and I

were able to do some
things by ourselves,

she needed us to take
some of that pressure off.

Now it just feels like we're
all just surviving together.

Damn.

Both my parents are role
models in different ways.

I appreciate my
father's work ethic

and my mom's devotion
to the family.

In my family, the man
has all the power.

(whispered chattering)

If our bodies are a battleground,
then what are our minds?

Are they separate or the same?

If you control my body,
do you control my mind?

There are no laws for
thought, only for action.

But people believe that
if you control one,

you control the other.

Miss Johnson. (sighs)

This is a mess.

"They're calling this
the year of the woman

and movements like Riot Grrrl
that don't ask for equality

but take it without apology.

In my family, the man
has all of the power,

so how am I supposed
to find my own?"

Dissecting how society's
patriarchal dynamics

play out in your own family

as you explore your independence
as a woman is a good start,

but this is an emotional
torrent of victim hood.

You're not showcasing how this

will fuel your further studies

or your contributions
to society.

This whole women in punk music

is always talking about
accepting your anger

and standing up and
fighting for your rights.

It's all so inspiring but I
just, I don't, I don't know.

I don't know how
to put it out there

without sounding
like a huge mess.

Well you edit it.

Use that critical mind
you've honed here.

Carving out sense from something
emotional is difficult.

Yes, especially when you're
so biased, but not impossible.

You think I'm biased?

Well, let me ask you this,

your mother chose your father

and every time he
acts like a patriarch,

she chooses him again, why?

So you're saying
that she wants that?

And that's not okay?

You want your parents to
respect your choices an adult.

Can you accept theirs?

Do you believe that your
father, in his mind,

is doing what he
thinks is right?

I mean, he could do
it in a better way.

Well, are you always
doing everything

to the best of your abilities?

I was just, I'm just...

I hate how I can't
change anything.

I mean he never listens.

I have no power, my
mom has no power.

There is no perfect choice.

Just a choice, which leads
to another and another.

But thinking and
planning and stressing

doesn't give you any more
control over the outcome.

Your father is still
fighting that lesson.

You have a chance
to learn it now.

Oh.

This is so exhausting.

Go back over your paper

as if you were an
admissions person.

Use emotion where
it's effective,

but make sure the
reasoning is sound.

to thank the three panelists

and thank the three
candidates for participating,

President Bush, Governor
Clinton and Mr. Perot.

They will appear again
together on October the-

(Camelia humming
in the distance)

Why don't you take
out your college essay

and we'll go over it together.

Ms. Scattergood
has it covered.

Jennifer.

It's not finished.

Then we'll work on it together.

(Camelia singing in
foreign language)

(Jack clears his throat)

(Jenny sighs)

What is this?

All I've ever wanted
was for you to succeed,

to be anything you ever
dreamed of becoming.

I work so hard to make sure

that you have anything you need

and I'm some sort of monster?

Your mother and I,
we are partners.

She is not a victim.

You treat her like dirt.

You never let her speak

and you never let her
speak Spanish to us,

which probably makes you racist,

which I don't even want to
know what you think of me.

And you think, you think
that Mom agrees with you,

because it's
impossible for anybody

to have another opinion
other than yours.

And you may not beat us, but
you definitely control us.

Hey, Jennifer.

Are you done?

No, I'm not.

You can't dictate me.

I'm 18 and I'm going to college

and I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing with my life.

I'm scared to try anything new

because I'm scared of failing.

But I don't want
to go to Harvard.

(tense music)

We used to be pals.

When did you decide you
couldn't talk to me?

I don't know if I ever could.

(melancholy music)

(Jack clears throat)

The kids that go to
that fancy private school

that you go to are
from wealthy families,

prominent in the community.

They are all going to
Ivy League schools.

They have trust funds.

You don't.

What you do have is access

to a very exclusive club,

one that can open
up any door for you.

You want to experiment?
You want to explore?

They have the power
for you to do that.

They can give you all of that.

Don't throw it away
before you even get there

because they don't
let you in twice.

Not very smart for a
smart girl like you.

(pensive music)

Not very smart.



For you to succeed.

Your mother and I,
we are partners.

She is not a victim.

and you want to rebel â™ª

Good evening from the
University of Richmond,

where tonight the
candidates and the voters

mix it up in a
freewheeling format

that's never been tried before.

This evening will be part
debate, part game show,

part talk show,
and all important.

For your reports
on the election,

I want you to watch
the TV coverage tonight

and write a summary of
the event and its results.

What if our parents
won't let us stay up late?

Get up early in the morning
and read the newspaper.

Mr. Riley.

Can we do it as a group project?

I suppose.


wrong one and vote for Bush?

to say who you're voting for.

I'm not voting for.

Where is everyone?

election night thing.

They didn't make
you go with them?

They try and give me space.

When I told my dad
I was coming here,

he was expecting this
whole big political party.

Nope.

Just little old me.


(speaking in Spanish)

Isabel's tamales are bomb.

She makes 'em like once a week

and I just eat my
way through them.

(speaking in Spanish)

Gracias, Isabel.

(Isabel speaks in Spanish)

So you wanna get
fucked up tonight?

You can.

You don't have to worry,
I'll take care of you.

No one's here to stop you.

So you wanna get fucked up?

I already feel fucked up.

Wanna get out of your head?

(soft music music)
(Jenny and Owen panting)

Is it wrong that I
kinda think that's sexy?

(Owen grunts)


(both laughing)

Yes!

Is this okay?

What?

I don't know.

I just keep asking
myself, so this is it?

(both chuckle)

(Jenny sobs)

Oh, shit.

No just don't, don't stop.

(Owen sighs)

Did you vote today?

Mm.

What? It's not gonna
make a difference.

Texas is solid red.

You asshole.

Oh, are we breaking
up all ready?

I'm kidding. I
voted with my dad.

(soft music)

Jesus, Mom.
Where were you?

I was watching the
election for my assignment.

The election
doesn't go this late.

I fell asleep on the couch.
What's going on?

Aye Mija, I was
not born yesterday.

I will always worry about you.

(phone line trilling)


(Jenny exhales)

Hey asshole, you
should get a life

and stop calling teenage
girls just to breathe heavily

and not say anything, all right?

Fuck off, don't call again.

(Jenny laughs)

(phone line trilling)


Drea, it's...

(Jenny laughs)

It's Jenny.

(Jenny sighs)

So, what happened?


sex mean you're now a woman?

Why does it mean we
have to be together?


what I'm thinking or feeling.

Although for a minute, I
forgot about everything.

We now have six women in the
Senate and 47 in the House.

Six out of 100 in the Senate

and 47 out of 400 in the
House isn't exactly a lot.

Well it's more than before.

We've had so many
election cycles

when we said this is the year
when women are going to win

and then, you know,
something happens.

That horizon of gender
equity is limitless for us.

And what we see today is
simply a dress rehearsal

for the day and time
we meet in convention

to nominate Madam President.

(crowd cheering)

So, is this change,

or is this progress?

out to be the bad guy.

You're driving a
wedge between us.



God damn it.
(glass shattering)


(ominous music)

(indistinct shouting
in the distance)


Hey.

(door slams)

Let me go tuck you back in.

We don't just need
a new generation,

we need a new gender of
leadership in America.

(people cheering)

for a new Cadillac
or Oldsmobile.

Westminster Motors knows

you have to go a
little bit further.

I uh, didn't apply.


Application's
completely filled out.

I can't believe you opened it.

Robert McGill, the
guy that interviewed you

is having a holiday
party next week

and he's extended the invite.

His son, who also
goes to Harvard,

is having a few of his friends
over that you can meet.

This is really good news.

Oh.
(Jack snaps fingers)

News, news is about to start.

Where's the remote control?

The news is starting right now.

Congratulations.



Application's

(melancholy music)


I got into Harvard.

What?

Yay.
That's awesome.

You deserve it, it's
what you wanted.

It's what I want.

It is what I want.




Application's

(Jenny sighs)

What I want, is
to get fucked up.

completely filled out.

Application's

(people chattering)

This is your night, enjoy.

Jack.

Robert, good to see you.
You too, how are you?

Fantastic.

You remember my
daughter, Jennifer.

I certainly do.

She left quite the
impression at her interview.

My son Parker's right over there

if you want to say hello.

Let's get you a drink.


(people chattering)
(festive music)

Grace.

Martin?

You went to my school.

Class of 1990.
Yeah.

I'm sorry, what is your name?

Jenny. Jenny Johnson.

How funny, it's
like the Jetson's.

â™ª Judy Jetson â™ª

(Grace chuckles)

I'm Parker, Robert's son.

Jenny.

Uh, do you go to Harvard?


now I oversee bonds in the city.

So you're a legacy?

Yeah.

Lucky you.

Well, it was great
to see you again.

And it was so good to meet you.

Yeah, all right.

Bye.

(festive violin music)
(people chattering)

Hey, dad.

Excuse me.
All right.

Can we go?

I'm kinda tired.

We just got here.

Some of these people
may be your future.

(people chattering)

(phone line trilling)

Johnson's residence.

Hi, Mom.

Could you come pick me up?

I'm bored and Dad
doesn't want to leave.


Not just for your future
but for your father, too.

Okay.

Bye.

(Jenny sighs)

Hey, where were you?

Your father called.

He is worried sick.

He's on his way home.

Why?

He wanted to stay, I wanted
to go, so I called a taxi.

(tense music)

What's gotten into you?

What's wrong?

Everything is wrong, Dad.

I don't want to go to Harvard

and you're just not
listening to me.

Everybody gets nervous.
It's perfectly normal.

You're gonna be okay.

Everything's gonna be fine.

Is that the best hug
you can come up with?

(tense music)

(indistinct
whispered chattering)



No way, J, what are you doing?

Oh my gosh, thank you.

Party at mine?

Maybe.

There's actually this
concert coming up, yeah.

Oh cool, scary chicks
screaming. I can dig it.

Hey, they're proving
a point, you know, okay?

They're angry, women are angry

and they have every
right to be angry

about so many different things

and you wouldn't know
about this, okay?

Okay, okay, you're right.

You know what? You
don't get it, whatever.

(Jenny sighs)

Sorry, just stressed.

I needed this, so thank you.

Is it Halloween?

(Jack chuckles)

I'm going to a
concert with Drea.

What kind of concert?

It's a punk concert.

Where is this concert?

Does it matter?

I'm 18, I can go wherever
I want with whoever.

(hand slams)

Jack!

That's enough of this.

I'm not gonna
tolerate that behavior

while you are under this roof.

Are you kicking me out?

What? No.

No, of course not.
Dad.

Are you kicking me out?

You're 18.

An adult under the law.

But let me remind
you of something,

you're still in high school,

a school I pay a
pretty penny for

Then I'll go to a public
school or I'll get my GED.

Is that what you want?

Throw all of your hard work,

everything you've worked
for, right down the drain?

Just tell me.

Tell me.

'Cause I just might
grant you your wish.

(tense music)

(phone ringing)


I'm sorry Andrea, Jenny's
not available right now.

Mom, I got it.


Drea, my parents
are being psycho.

Jennifer!

I dropped acid.

You dropped what?

I dropped acid.

I dropped acid.

I dropped acid.

(tense music)

(Camelia speaking in Spanish)

(Jenny laughs)

Who gave this to you?

Was it Andrea?

Maybe you should take
her to the hospital.

A doctor can't do anything.

Maybe we should call the police.

I'm 18, I could go to real jail.

We gotta call the school.

If you got that from
anybody, anybody!

You could get expelled.

You could get brain damage.

Brain damage.

Your kids, they're gonna
have birth defects.

Brain damage.
(Jenny chuckles)

You do realize that
I'm, like, hallucinating?

(soft strange music)

I'm hallucinating and I could...



She's not listening Jack-

she would lose focus.

I need a highlighter,

Oh.

I need a crayon.

I said hush. Hush.

Hush.

What's gotten into you?

What's gotten into you?

What's the matter with you?

What, what's gotten into you?

Don't touch me.

Could you just
stay with me, please?

At least 'til I fall asleep?

Let's change you to
your bedtime clothes.

Mom.
Hm?

What's going on in Mexico?

And don't say nothing.

My mother.

She's dying.

What?
Mm-hm.

We have to go down there.

It's not a good time right now.

Says who, Dad?

I love him.

He's your father and
he loves you very much.

And me and your brother.

He has a weird
way of showing it.

Sometimes we hurt the
ones we love the most.

That's terrible.

You'll understand someday.

No, I won't.

You want me to rub your
back and sing you a lullaby?

Yeah.

Yeah?

(singing in foreign language)

believe I did that.

But somehow I feel lighter.

Relieved.

Happy to be alive.


How are you feeling?

I'm good.

So, you want to go see a movie?

No, I don't want to see a movie.

Mikey, you wanna go see a movie?

Harvard costs a lot of money

and I'm not sending you
halfway across the country

if that's how
you're gonna behave.

I already told you I
don't want to go to Harvard.

All schools cost a lot of money.

Then I'll apply
for financial aid.

It won't be enough.
I'll get a job.

Then I'll take a gap year,

and I'll figure this out.


How are you gonna
support yourself?

You can't choose my path for me.

So you expect me to pay
for all of your choices,

like the choice you
made last night?

You could have been
severely injured.

And you put your mother
and me through hell.

It won't happen again.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Could you pass me the syrup?

(Jenny sighs)

Can't believe I did
something that crazy.

Maybe you should just stick
to other forms of escape.

I just don't know what to do.

My parents have
spent a lot of money

trying to help me,
give me the best.

In middle school I even spent
some time in an institution.

What, why?

I'm better now.

Functional, the doctors say.

I pass my classes, I ace
my standardized tests,

haven't gotten arrested,
play nice with others.

So I made a deal
with my parents,

as long as I'm not
slitting my wrists

or jumping off bridges,
they let me be.

How can you be that honest?

I'm a terrible Riot Grrrl.

(both laughing)

What?

I thought you were pretty-

some big revelation

and figured it all out.

â™ª Pushing forward,
not looking back â™ª

It felt like defeat and
triumph wrapped in one.

â™ª Not looking back,

â™ª Pushing forward,
not looking back â™ª

â™ª In the back of my
head, things that I try â™ª

â™ª Facing forward â™ª

â™ª Underneath your bed â™ª

I'm trying real
hard to understand

what's going on
with you right now.

Everybody knows
what they want to do.

What they want.

Kelly's going to Spelman.

Owen doesn't fucking care

but he's gonna end up at
some Ivy League think tank.

I mean, even you
know what you want.

Don't be a bitch.

You have everything you
could ever fucking want.

Fuck.

I'm worried about you.

Yeah, I don't
think I'll be doing

anything like that anytime soon.

Silly rabbit,
trips are for kids.

(both chuckle)

Will you still be my best
friend when we're real adults?

Always.

Congratulations.

Early decision, Harvard.

It's not binding,

so I can still apply
and decide in April.

It's frowned upon.

It's the best I
can do right now.

Nice work on the
literary magazine.

They're a little unpolished.

I thought that was the point.

"If it be now, 'tis not to come.

If it be not to
come, it will be now.

If it be not now, yet it will
come, the readiness is all.

Since no man of aught
he leaves knows,

what is it to leave betimes?"

Let be.

This is awesome.

Thank you.

you ready to take the oath?


Will you please raise your
right hand and repeat after me?

I, William Jefferson Clinton...

say everything changed,

that everything
was better, fixed.

But the truth is...

Complicated.

Though we march to
the music of our time,

our mission is timeless.

Each generation of Americans

must define what
it means to be...

remembering this all wrong.

Maybe I'm missing the point.

But all of these moments
are frozen in my memory

of a time when I became me.
