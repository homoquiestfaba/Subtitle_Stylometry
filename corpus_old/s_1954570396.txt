 <i>Guten tag, Herr Marshak.</i>       

        (gasping)               

        (sighs heavily)         

    (big band music playing     
        on radio)               

    (knocking on door)          

        Who is it?              

                            MAN:
                    Mr. Cook?   

    Yeah. Who are you?          

                  A war buddy of
                 Jack Marshak's.

              Oh.               

                  May I come in?

          Hell, yeah.           

    Any friend of Marshak's     
is welcome in this house.       

Would you like a cold one?      

                  No, thank you.

    Where did you know Jack?    

          Oh, we spent some time
            together at Belburg.

Oh, "Hell's Toilet." Yeah.      

     I was one of the guys      
    liberated it, you know.     

Yeah. I know.                   

You don't look old enough       
    to be a WWII vet.           

Let's just say                  
I've been well-preserved.       

Is this your unit?              

                     Yeah. Yeah.

                 Seven guys from
                 five countries.

                Crack commandos.

                We captured this
                 Nazi scientist.

                    He was doing
            experiments on POWs.

Horst Mueller.                  

    Ah, we should have killed   
              that evil bastard.

    Guys like that don't deserve
        to live, even in prison.

                That's me there.

        The good-looking one.   

                Bet you can't   
            pick out Marshak.   

                That's right.   

          That's him.           

    You know he got a medal     
          that night?           

Really?                         
             Yeah.              

      That's me and Shaw,       
     Caruthers, Ivanovitch,     

  Simpson and Frenchy Leroux.   

      Not many of us left.      

            No, there aren't.   

(choking gasps)                 

        (raspy gasping)         

         (sharp crack)          

    (speaking German):          

    (cuckoo clock sounding)     

(bell clanks, door closes)      

Reporting for duty,             
Captain Marshak.                

                     Present and
             accounted for, sir.

             Shaw.              

            Simpson.            

You old bastard.                

        (laughing)              

                     It's been a
                lot of years.   

Been a long time, Captain.      

We should be meeting            
under better circumstances.     

You ready for the funeral?      

                I'm not going.  

                    Why not?    

        I just don't want to.   

Jack, when we shot our way      
         into Belburg,          

    it was Lefty led us in.     

If it wasn't for him...         

              Look, I don't want
            to go, all right?   

Jack, you got to.               
                        Why?    

     What good is it going to do
     seeing Lefty in his coffin?

Jack, we're getting old.        

All we can do                   
for each other now              

is to see that                  
we get buried right.            

        Here's to you, Lefty.   

    What's that stuff,          
         lighter fluid?         

          It's the same stuff we
        drank in the foxhole.   

        You going soft on me?   

Why would anyone                
kill Lefty?                     

         Or Caruthers.          

Caruthers?                      

                  Yeah, somebody
              murdered him, too.

    How?                        

                I don't know.   

Jack, what                      
are you doing?                  

                    My God. Look
                  at this wound.

Jack,       He's been strangled.

        for God's sake.         

        MAN (on radio):         
No, you can't, my friend,       
but you can't be bullied either.

Maybe, if we made an example of 
one of these tin-pot dictators, 

took his country away from him, 

  people might not be so quick  
    to make trouble for us.     

    What a jerk.                

        Makes you wonder        
why we fought the big one.      

          Hmm. Kind of makes you
             think, though. Hmm.

      Hey, I'm not saying       
        we should go in         

and blow these little countries 
          off the map,          

  but we sure as hell deserve   

    a lot more respect          
      than we're getting.       

    (radio continues playing    
         indistinctly)          

Come on, Jack.                  
Let's do some drinking.         

This is supposed                
to be a wake.                   

          Didn't Lefty have a 20
        game season in Triple A?

Only problem is,                
it was three and 17.            

      To hear him tell it,      

    he would have made          
the world forget Cy Young.      

            I just called the   
        Veterans Administration.

        Ivanovitch and Leroux   
            are dead as well.   

         I want to know         
  if they were murdered, too.   

    Barbed wire is how          
      the Butcher killed.       

Jack, the Butcher is dead.      

  I dreamt about him the night  
that Lefty was strangled.       

      A week hasn't passed      

     where I haven't had a      
    nightmare about the war.    

         This was real.         

 I was back there about to die. 

          (loud thud)           
             JACK:              
        Oh, God...              

          Where am I sleeping?  

Don't be ridiculous.            
I'll be fine.                   

            You need a friend   
            around you, Marshak.

          I can stay a few days.

Shaw...                         

 Look, you're not getting rid of
  me until you shake this thing.

Micki and Ryan                  
are out of town.                

So take Micki's room, it's      
at the head of the stairs.      

                Don't be so damn
                morose, Jack.   

            We all die sometime.

We don't all get                
murdered, do we?                

        Let's get some shut-eye.

          A few days with me and
     you'll be out of the dumps.

Shaw, thanks.                   

        I hope you still feel   
        the same way tomorrow   

    because you're gonna have   
        a hell of a hangover.   

                      (chuckles)

(whistling "Lili Marlene")      

        Simpson...              

    (chains rattling)           

    (speaking German):          

         (man groaning)         

          (screaming)           

          (screaming)           

        (gasping)               

      (panicked screaming)      

Easy, Jack, easy.               

    Easy.                       

You were screaming like         
someone was killing you.        

              Jack Marshak, yes.

                  Ah, thank you.

    (cuckoo clock sounding)     

                Who was that?   

Courier from the                
Veterans Administration.        

Coffee's over there             
if you want it.                 

Oh, my God.                     

              What is it?       

Ivanovitch and Leroux were      
both murdered in Europe.        

And they were strangled,        
just like Lefty and Caruthers.  

             I can't believe it.

        When did this happen?   

Within the year.                

All since I've been             
having these dreams.            

    Oh, snap out of it, Jack.   

            Mueller's rotting in
                some German jail

             and Rausch is dead.

I wish I could                  
believe it.                     

    Mueller was experimenting   
         with reanimation, Shaw.

     The bodies in that lab that
      were cryogenically frozen.

What are you saying?            

That he froze Rausch            
before we captured him?         

                  He had time.  

Don't be ridiculous!            

                 Stranger things
                  have happened.

Not in my lifetime.             

Just listen to                  
yourself, Jack.                 

Nobody comes back               
from the dead.                  

Now, I don't know               
who's doing this,               

but it's not some               
phantom from our past.          

              MAN:              
You can't sterilize people      
 because they're mentally ill.  

Sterilizing people              
in mental hospitals             

is an American idea,            
my friend.                      

It was very popular             
before World War II.            

Are you suggesting to me        
that American doctors           

would do something like         
that without giving it          
a lot of thought?               

    Well, no, but that          
     doesn't make it right.     

Of course they thought about it.

    And so should you.          

    And while you're at it,     

why don't you think about       
     those people out there     

spreading sexual diseases.      

Maybe it would stop them.       

     Hey, don't get me onto     
      that subject, Karl.       

     Well, I'm going to...      

        tomorrow night.         

  (lively theme music playing)  
  That's all the time we have.  

     Tomorrow, an epidemic      
  is sweeping across the land.  

A disease without a cure.       

      I want to know what       
      you'd do to stop it.      

  Think about it, and tomorrow  
I'll tell you my solution.      

     This is Karl Stiener.      

    Thank you for listening,    
            America.            

    You have the uncanny ability
  to make the most radical ideas

                sound acceptable
              to the common man.

You make it sound as            
if I'm trying to deceive them.  

People aren't that stupid.      

The reason they tune me in is   
because I tell them the truth.  

        You've become a major   
influence over the past year,   

         yet people seem to know
          very little about you.

        Tell me about your past.

I'm much more                   
interested in the future.       

         You're on the cover of 
           <i>Newsmaker</i> this month.

    And they're saying that your
    days in radio are numbered--

                that your future
                 is in politics.

            MUELLER:            
             <i>Rausch.</i>            

Let's just say I intend         
to keep reaching                

the citizens of this            
country with my message.        

    (speaking German):          

You'll have to excuse me.       

        One more thing, Karl,   
      just what is your message?

We must restore this country    
to a position of power.         

Let the weak, the lazy,         
the uneducated                  

get out of the way.             

    (door opens then closes)    

    (toilet flushing)           

            MUELLER:            
              <i>Nein!</i>             

Jack, you're making me nervous. 

          You should be nervous.
         He's trying to kill us.

 The Butcher isn't hunting us.  
          He can't be.          

        All right, then you tell
            me what's happening.

        Look, I'll admit        
          that Mueller          

         was into some          
      pretty weird things.      

     But he didn't know how     
    to raise the dead.          

         I wouldn't be too sure.

     I haven't opened this      
         since the war.         

                What the hell is
                     this stuff?

Things I collected              
in Europe.                      

        This...                 

is Mueller's diary.             

             Diary?             

                Look at that.   

It's just a swastika.           

Yes, but the surrounding circle 
    makes it a symbol           

     for the Thule Society.     

          Come again?           

    The Thule Society           
 was an ancient Teutonic group  

  of alchemists and warlocks.   

 They believed they could grant 
     ten centuries of life.     

  You're not making any sense.  

I'm trying to tell you that     
Mueller used Thule secrets      

to bring Rausch back to life.   

                Do you expect me
                to believe that?

          Look, Jack, you need  
         some sleep, right now. 

      I'm phoning Simpson.      

     He should be with us.      

                      Good idea.

He may talk some sense into you.

    (engine starting)           

        ANNOUNCER:              
    You are listening           
    to a re-broadcast           

of The Karl Stiener Show.       

     No phone calls please.     

            RAUSCH:             
Karl Stiener. What do you think?

              MAN:              
  I think you're a racist pig.  

            RAUSCH:             
      Listen, I don't have      
    anything against anybody    

     if they're productive.     

    But let's face it,          
        some people use         

 aspiring to impossible heights 
 as an excuse to go on welfare. 

They think "If I can't be       
      Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,      

        I'll sell crack         
      till I get a break."      
         What an idiot.         

              MAN:              
      You know something?       

      If this conversation      
         was in person,         

      I'd be real tempted       
    to rearrange your face.     

         (sharp crack)          

     Should have been here      
         two hours ago.         

     Where the hell is he?      

        (phone ringing)         

Curious Goods. Marshak.         

     Oh, God.                   

(indistinct radio transmissions)

    (camera shutter clicks)     

            We found him slumped
      over the wheel of his car.

    We think he was strangled   
     with a piece of piano wire.

              We're still trying
                to figure out   

            what caused these   
                 puncture marks.

          Barbed wire.          

                    Could be.   

(whistling "Lili Marlene")      

Rausch can't be alive.          

It isn't possible.              

    You'd be surprised at the   
    things that are possible.   

  The Thule Society was feared  
  throughout Medieval Europe,   

     very powerful wizards      

          said to have          
     learned their secrets      

  from the ancient Norse gods.  

Jack, I can't believe this      
sort of thing can happen.       

              I can, and it did.

They infused their powers       
    in silver amulets           

      which could seek out      
         their enemies,         

communicate over great distances

      and raise the dead.       

          Rausch would have been
             an ideal candidate.

                He was one of   
            Hitler's favorites--

            an intelligent...   

                      dangerous,
                powerful man.   

And Mueller has such an amulet? 

         Yes, he does.          

But he's been                   

in prison since the night       
        we grabbed him.         

  There's no way that Mueller   

     could resurrect Rausch     
          without it.           

                So he got it, or
         someone got it for him.

              Overseas operator?

            I want to place a   
        call to West Germany.   

              Yes, to the warden

          of the Allied Military
            Prison in Berlin.   

        Thank you, I'll hold.   

            RAUSCH:             
 I know it isn't a very popular 
    view to hold these days,    

      but, uh, the simple       
    facts of life are           

that this country's being       
     held back by deadbeats     

 living on welfare, food stamps 
     and Medicare handouts.     

The people who work for a living
      are being bled dry.       

              MAN:              
      You're right, Karl.       

    You're absolutely right.    

        You know, I paid        
  a fortune in taxes this year  

and what did I get for it?      
        I ask you.              

            MUELLER:            

              MAN:

            WARDEN:             
     <i>Of course, Herr Mueller</i>    
   <i>is in custody, Mr. Marshak,</i>  

        but regulations         
      strictly forbid him       

     receiving phone calls      
      or uncensored mail.       

                Warden, I've got
                to speak to him.

 Then you'll have to come here. 

              Okay, then I'll be
              on the next plane.

Jack, you're in                 
no shape to...                  

                Yeah, well...   
             When can I see him?

      Whenever you arrive,      

    but you will need           
     a security clearance.      

      It has been required      
    since his escape.           

                Mueller escaped?

          A year ago.           

    He got across the wall,     

but the East German police      
    caught him the next day.    

          Oh, my God.           

Why aren't you ready?           

The plane leaves                
in just over an hour.           

                 I saw enough of
                 Germany in '45.

                  I'm not going.

You can't stay here             
    by yourself.                

                I never ran away
             from anybody, Jack.

        I'm not starting now.   

We're not running away.         

We're staying together          
until this thing's over.        

Look, if you're alone,          
he has a chance                 

of picking you off,             
just like he did the others.    

                  I'm not going.

Well, then you'll be            
a sitting duck.                 

        Lefty and Simpson didn't
             know what hit them.

                I'll be watching
                for the bastard.

This...                         

saw me through Europe.          

Keep it close.                  

Here.                           

              Don't worry, Jack.

                  I can take    
            care of myself.     

    Yeah.                       

You're the only troops          
that I've got now.              

Got a plane to catch.           

(door opens, bell jingles)      

                    These are in
             order, Mr. Marshak.

All right.                      

             Please have a seat.

      I'll get a guard to escort
     you to Herr Mueller's cell.

          Oh, my God.           

        Hey, yeah, yeah.        

      Can you, uh, give me      
 an overseas operator, please.

      (footfalls receding)      


(German accent):                
I've been expecting you.        

I'm so glad you                 
could make it.                  

             Why are you killing
                 my friends?    

Your friends are dying          
halfway across the world.       

What have I got                 
to do with it?                  

            Where's the Butcher?

Isn't he in                     
his grave?                      

                 You know damn  
                 well he isn't. 

Mmm...                          

How can that be?                

You killed him,                 
didn't you?                     

Isn't that why they gave        
you all those medals?           

                I killed him,   
                all right.      

        You brought him back.   

You don't                       
look rested.                    

Are you having trouble sleeping?

 Too many... unsettling dreams? 

What's it like                  
to be hunted, Jack?             

What's it like to know that he's
 after you even in your dreams? 

     Why did you bring him back?

For the Reich to be reborn.     

                Rausch will fail
                 in his mission.

                    Shaw will be
                waiting for him.

     Your friend is             
  already dead, Jack.           

                You're lying.   

You fell asleep a few           
moments ago, didn't you?        

                    You bastard.

 You don't know how happy I am  

      to share this moment      
        with you.               

         I'll kill you, Mueller!

            45 years            
I've waited for this day.       

Now everyone who put me in here 
            is dead,            

except you, Jack.               

I wanted you saved for the last.

Go on, Jack.                    

Take it to him.                 

He's been waiting to meet       
you for a <i>very</i> long time.       

We were the master race,        

burying the weak,               

the purposeless,                
the malformed...                

purifying the world!            

We are still the master race!   

We <i>will</i> rise again!

              MAN:              
     I'm telling you, Karl,     
        I've had enough.        

    I think we should           
     put every one of these     

    on a slow boat to China.    

     When the boat arrives,     
          nuke China.           

That may not be such a bad idea.

          As you know,          
this is my last broadcast.      

Now, some of you may have heard 

    that I'm throwing my hat

    Well, that's true.          

        So you and I are        
     gonna keep on talking,     

     only not on the radio.     

    I'm gonna need your help    
    for what I have planned.    

      And I think you know      
         what that is.          

  I know what you're thinking.
