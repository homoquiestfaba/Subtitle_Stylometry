Three Communist PT boats
attacked an American destroyer

off the coast of Vietnam
yesterday,

and today, President Johnson's
response was hard and tough.

He has ordered the U.S. Navy
to continue patrolling there,

and if they are attacked,
to destroy their attackers.

I understand the feelings

of those who regret that
we must undertake air attacks.

I share those feelings.

Some nights, we're
the only airplane going up...

going up into the north

and when you're thinking
you're the only Americans

over North Vietnam,

it kind of makes you wonder
just a little bit, you know.

"What am I doing here?"

We have carefully limited
those raids.

They've been directed
at concrete and steel

and not human lives.

There are at least 850
antiaircraft and missile sites

around Hanoi and Haiphong.

These figures make
Hanoi's air defense

the toughest in the world.

If you can get between...

a ridge between you
and that radar site,

they can't guide
a missile at you.

It's just when you get down
in the delta in the flatlands,

that 30-mile ring around...
the city of Hanoi,

it's... it's a bear.

Representatives of Hanoi
simply returned our message

in a plain envelope.

Residents of North Vietnam's
capital felt confident

in the knowledge
that their city was off-limits

to U.S. warplanes.

With American sons
in the fields far away,

I shall not seek, and l
will not accept the nomination

of my party for another term
as your president.

The greatest honor
history can bestow

is the title of peacemaker.

Do you think it's worth it?

Yeah, l... I don't know.

They... they say we're
fighting for something.

I don't know.

Through a long and bitter
struggle in Vietnam,

American fighting men

have served the cause
of freedom magnificently.

You're... you're pretty scared

when you have to roll in
on something out there,

especially when you look down,
and you see nothing

but a black cloud or
a white cloud down below you.

It's a... it's about as...
as scary a mission

as I've ever been on.

I think it tries you
to just about the maximum,

you know, the missions.

Hey, Morg.

Did you ever notice how...

how some nights you could see
more stars

than other nights?

Huh? You ever notice that?

Hmm?

The stars.

Oh, yeah.

I've got an update.

I'm cycling to
the coast-in point.

You're getting
in a rut.

You're getting in a rut.

I mean, did you ever
stop to think

you're taking your job just
a little bit too seriously?

Look at me--
I enjoy my work.

Yeah, I'll bet.

See, I'm happy.

See? Look.

Enemy search radar

Iooking for company.

Okay...

Time to get on down.

Here we go.

Black Eagle, Devil 5-0-5.
Feet dry.

That's a roger, 5-0-5.

Look at that small-arms fire
down there, Morg.

Every cousin with a rifle, huh?

Jesus, you call that a rifle?

I lost them.

Yeah, you hope.

You got that riverbend ahead?

Just picked it up.

One more minute on this heading
to the turn point.

23 Mike, Mike-- I see them.

Go active on ECM.

Jam 'em up.

ECM active.

We're jammin'.

Where is it?
You got it? You see it?

No, not yet.

SAM, 10:00.

Jam!

Ah, Jesus.

That was a piece of cake.

This is it.

Stepping in to attack.

Arm 'em.

Your pickle is hot.

Get us up to 500 feet, partner,

unless you want to frag
your ass.

Nag, nag, nag.

Ground lock.

Steady...

They're off!

If you got the time,

we got the beer.

How about it?

Did you see anything down there?

Any secondary explosions?

Nothing.

Well, that's real nice.

-Suspected truck park.
-Nothing!

Nothing.

Goddamn it.

Man, there was nothing there.

There never was.

Well, we're really raising hell

with the jungle tonight,
aren't we?

What is it?

What the hell is it?

What is it?

Oh, dear God.

-Oh, God Almighty.
-You got to help me!

Let go of it for a minute!

I don't want to...

Black Eagle,
this is Devil 5-0-5.

I'm declaring emergency!

My bombardier's been hit.

I repeat:
my bombardier's been hit.

Requesting a ready deck
upon arrival!

I'll be on the bridge outside.

This is the enforcer.
Make a ready deck.

We have an emergency inbound.

5-0-5, switch to button three
for approach.

Uh, roger that.

Button three, Devil 5-0-5.

Gear is down.

I got to let go
just for a second.

Come on.
I can do it.

-Got to hang on.
-I'm okay, Jakey.

Hang in there, shipmate.

We're gonna make it.

-Now keep the faith.
-I'll make it.

No strain, partner.

5-0-5, call your ball,
call your ball.

200 ball, six point zero.

Ride your ball.

Working 22 knots.
You're high.

We're gonna make it.

Gotta hang in there.

Oh, geez.

Shit, he's still too high!

Jakey...

You're too high!

Morg!

Steady your line,
steady your line.

Come left, Jake.

I'm coming in.

He's too high!
Wave him off!

5-0-5, wave off! Wave off!

Tie 'em down!
Tie 'em down!

I told you we'd make it, Morg.

I told you we'd make it.

Everything's cool...

We made it, Morg.

I told you we'd make it.

I got him, sir, I got him.

Just let go, for Christ's sake.

Let go!

Let go of him, sir!

I got him!

Come on, goddamn it!

Let go of him,
for Christ's sake!

Let me out,
corpsman, come on!

I need some pressure in here!

Get him out of here, goddamn it!

Medic, come on!

Watch, watch the head.

Stand by!

Bring it in, bring it in,
bring it in! Move it!

Morg!

He's gone, man.

Come on, Jake.

Come on.

Oh, Jesus Christ, man.

It'll be all right, Jake.

It's going to be all right, man.

Jake, we don't want any more
of this if we can help it.

What altitude were you at
when McPherson got hit?

300, 500...
something like that.

I'd just taken a gun out
with a snake eye.

300 or 500?

It makes a difference.

I don't know.

I'm a little shaken up
right now.

You're what?

I said I'm shaken up, sir.

I got Morg's blood all over me.

Maybe we can stop the war

till things get better then.

Nobody asked you to stop
the war, did they?

Put McPherson's death
behind you, Mr. Grafton.

Right here, right now.

Yes, sir.

Now, what altitude
were you flying at?

Uh... 200.

200 maybe, AGL.

I pushed the nose over...

started a shallow...

dive in on the gun
and leveled out.

Some SAMs had tried us
when we'd come in,

and I wanted to... to get
out of there low and fast.

You came out
by a different route?

Yeah. Yes, sir.

About 30 miles, I guess.

Lucky small-arms fire.

Mmm.

All right.

Just bad luck, that's all.

Just ran out of luck.

Take Mr. Grafton
off the flight schedule.

You got liberty in Subic
in a couple days.

You need the rest.

What was your target?

A suspected truck park.

You hit it?

Oh, yeah, we hit it.

Trees.

A bunch of trees.

There was nothing there again.

What's your problem?

Spit it out.

Well, I don't think trees
in a suspected truck park

is worth a man's life.

Targets are picked for
political consideration,

Mr. Grafton,

with the best intelligence
we have available.

You have any trouble with that?

Well, I don't think losing Morg

is a political
consideration, sir.

Look...

I know losing
McPherson is lousy.

I don't like the targets,
either.

I hate them.

But... I don't want any
blood feuds going on.

Half the time,
it isn't the mission

you're flying
that kills you,

it's the one before--
do you read me?

Yes, sir.

Good.

I want you to write
a letter to Morg's wife.

I'll mail it in
a couple of days

along with one from me.

Help put this thing
behind you, okay?

Thanks, skipper.

For what?

You die, son, and
I'll piss on your grave.

Down here, down here.

Hey, Jake. Jake!

What the hell?

You're not thinking
about jumping are you?

No, not yet.

You need any help,
Mr. Grafton?

We thought you might want
to talk or something.

Oh, I'm fine.
Thanks, Chief.

So Jake, how'd you guys do?

I mean, you know,
before it happened.

Trees.

Yeah, trees?

Right.

-Again.
-Again?

Hey, Jack, you were
with a Marine detachment.

You ever
get used to it?

Yeah, I got used to it.

I'm a doc-- that's what I do.

Naw, nobody gets used to it.

You can put your job in front
of it like the skipper,

or you can even joke about it,
but nobody gets used to it.

That's right.

How about the old man?

Has he always been
like he is now?

When he chews you out?

Mm-hmm.

Maybe he figures he might not
get another chance.

Hey, guys, come on.

We got a squad room meeting,
okay, Jake?

All right, all right, all right.

I got all night, too.

I want to introduce
our new replacement pilot.

Mr. Barlow, up front.

Let's hear about your life.
Come on.

Yeah! Yeah!

Up front, up front,
up front, up front,

up front, up front,
up front...

All right.

All right, all right, shut up!

I'm Lieutenant J.G. Jack Barlow.

Sit down, asshole!

How old are you, son?

24, sir.

You look 12.

Did they teach you how to shave
at the Naval Academy?

I didn't think so.

Razor.

Ah, that's your new
name for now: Razor.

Excellent name, skipper.

Yeah!

All right, Walter.

Thank you.

All right, at, uh...

tomorrow at 1000
on the flight deck

there will be a memorial service
for McPherson.

The uniform is tropical,
white, long.

Oh, yeah, one other thing.

Uh, somebody close that door
back there, will you?

Frank?

Now, this matter
of the phantom shitter.

Now, I know it's a phenomenon

that occurs on a
carrier in combat

that goes back
to World War I l,

but this has gotten
out of hand.

Last night, the
phantom left a note

saying he would strike,

and this morning, a turd was
found in the XO's ashtray.

That only means
one thing, gentlemen.

It is no fighter jock
or recon puke

who is doing this thing.

It is an A-6 driver,

because no one else
on this ship

can hit the XO's ashtray.

Yeah!

Right, right, right.

Hup.

Someone,

in this room right here,

is the phantom shitter.

Now, it could be your roommate,
pilot, bombardier...

Think about it.

Movie officer.

Yes, sir.

What's the film for tonight?

Uh, They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?, sir.

It's Jane Fonda, sir.

Any skin?

No, sir.

Cancel it.

Yeah!

Dear Sharon,

By now you've been notified
that Morgan is gone.

He was killed over Vietnam
flying a night strike

and... I wish I could say
that his death was necessary,

but... it wasn't.

The target we were bombing
was nonexistent,

and the mission was useless.

Too many good men have died like
Morgan these past two years.

I guess I knew him as well
as any man could know another.

He was... he was my best friend.

I know how heavy a burden

his loss is to you
and little Bobby,

and... and I know
how much he loved you.

Somehow I wish
there was something,

just one thing I could do

to make up for such a loss
as Morgan.

I go on, as Tennyson said,

and the world darkens around me,

"among new men, strange faces"
and other minds.

You have my deepest
and most sincere sympathy.

Jake.

Real sorry about Mr. McPherson,
sir.

What's this?

Thought he was single.

He was.

He was four days ago.

You know this girl, Chief?

Yeah, she's a looker.

Probably first piece of ass
he's ever had.

When did you get married, son?

Last time in port, sir.

You know you got to have
Navy permission

to marry a foreign national?

Your folks know?

No, sir.

Do you love her?

Well, yes, sir,
of course I do, sir.

I-I got a picture of
her here in my wallet.

No, that's all right.
It's all right.

You violated a major
regulation, Hardesty,

but I'm going to sign
your chit.

You realize that you're legally

and morally obligated
to this girl.

Do you know that?

Yes, sir.

Do you understand
what that means?

You got to support her.

Yes, sir.

This aircraft
has not been cleaned!

Why hasn't this aircraft
been cleaned?

I'll clean it myself, sir.

I'll see that it's done.

You do that,
you get it done!

Get it clean!

Sorry, sir, l...

No, don't explain, son,
just get it done.

Mr. Grafton won't hold it
against you.

He's just upset.

It's just that nobody's ever

come back dead like that, sir.

Whole ship knows about it.

A lot of them come down

just to take a look
at it, but...

I don't know why we
didn't clean it, sir.

When people die,
they're just gone.

But not like this, sir.

All right, all right.

That's all right, son,
that's all right.

This is the enforcer.

Stand by to recover the call.

Mr. Cole!
How you doing?

I'm Chief Poole.
You come this way.

Commander Camparelli
is waiting for you

down in the ready room.

Hold on, Chief.

All right, sir.

I want to smell it.

I've been away for a while.

I'm ready.

All right, sir.

Mr. Cole.

Have a seat.

I'm fine, sir.

Uh...

I was on the Coral Sea,
when you were on the Ranger.

Is that so?

Knew a lot of guys
in VA-35.

Knew Jim Becker.

Flew A-4s with him.

You went down with him,
didn't you?

That's right, sir.

And he didn't make it.

No, sir, he didn't.

I know the whole story.

Before and after.

I know a lot about you.

Well, I'm glad, sir,

because I know a lot
about you, too.

Everybody in the Navy
knows about you, sir.

Yeah?

What about me?

That you're a legend, sir.

Then that makes two of us.

And sometimes that can
be a bad influence on others.

I'll try and fit in, sir.

That's my job.

Make sure you do that.

Good evening, Mr. Cole.

We'll have to try
Sector A tomorrow.

Finding out now...

Mr. Grafton.

I'm sorry about
Mr. McPherson, sir.

Is, uh, Guffy around?

You seen him?

Uh, yes, sir.

He's... he's right there.

You wanted to see me, Guffy?

Yeah, just a minute.

Let me ask you something, Guffy.

You suppose there's anything...
anything valuable here?

If they had something,
it'd be up north, wouldn't it?

That's right, Mr. Grafton.

You see this?

This is Haiphong Harbor.

It's loaded with munitions.

They take 'em out of here,

and they stick 'em here,
in Hanoi.

But it's not for you,
it's restricted.

They didn't do it in '65,

we haven't flown
over it since '69,

so don't even think about it.

But I do have something here

that's gonna
brighten your day.

You know that strike you flew in
the south last week?

Yeah, we refueled at Da Nang.

That one?

Yeah.

Army bomb damage assessment
says you killed 37.

That's some body count,
eh, buddy?

You think I want
to know that, huh?

If you did what I did,
would you want to know?

No, for all you know,
those people were farmers.

You get that information,

you keep it to yourself,
all right?

I don't want to know about it.

Just keep it to yourself.

Do you even know who I am?

Yes, sir, I do, sir!

You're Commander Camparelli,
sir, the C.O.!

What kind of name
is Camparelli?!

It is an ltalian-
American name.

Have you ever met a black man
with a name like that?

No, you haven't.

I got that name

because somewhere in my past
there was a wop

in the woodpile.

Do I detect a smile

on your disgusting face,
Lieutenant Razor?

I thought not.

So it turns out that my family
are third-generation Mafia.

They were forced to make
a living in gambling,

extortion and murder,
so that their boy

could fly a jet aircraft
for the U.S. Navy.

So I take what I do serious.

Do you understand me, son?

Yes, sir, I do, sir.

Then get out of my sight.

Lieutenant Razor, dismissed!

Ah-- don't laugh.

He's your new wingman.

Just take one.

I'll hand it to you.

That's the one
I want you to have.

There's a pair of A-6s
going to Subic tomorrow.

I want you take one
with the doc.

I'll put Grafton and maybe
Boxman in the other one.

As soon as you get
Jake off the deck,

you fly him dizzy,
get him drunk,

anything to wind him down
before he goes up in flames.

Yeah...

All that guy needs is a...

strike on the match.

All right, now listen, Doc.

Don't touch anything.

Keep your hands in your lap.

Absolutely.

The only exception
is if you have to eject.

Eject?

Now, you got a yellow
and black handle

here and one here--
you pull it.

The command will be
"eject, eject, eject."

Three times, you got it?

Yes, "eject, eject, eject."

Do I say roger or...
just do it or what?

You even say "huh," you'll
be talking to yourself...

'cause I'll be gone.

Jake!

Give me 15 degrees lift.

We should make Luzon
in about 15 minutes.

You're getting pretty good
at this, aren't you?

I watch my BN a lot.

I sort of picked it up.

If I'm wrong, I don't know...

China.

What do you think?

Huh?

Swell.

That's good food man, good food.

You're my favorite pilot, Jake.

Did you know that?

I thought you were
your favorite pilot.

Hey, Sammy, how you doing
out there, man?

You enjoying yourself?
How's the doc?

I think Mad Jack's asleep.

No, I'm not.

Hey, follow the leader.

What do you think, huh?

How much?

Talk to the man.

Oh, I don't know.

What do you say,
five bucks, hard cash?

Oh, you're on, Cool Hand.

This is going to be
the most exciting thing

you've ever done
with your clothes on, Doc.

Oh, Jesus.

Oh, no.

Come on, Jake.

You can do better than this.

Now, I'm gonna have some fun.

Whoo!

Come on, Jake.

Doc's falling asleep here.

I'm getting a little
embarrassed.

Sammy, you're a dick!

Whoo! You can fly a plane, Jake!

Hey, Cool Hand.

Where are you guys?

Yee-hoo!

Here, Doc, take some oxygen.

You'll feel better...

Keep both hands on the wheel!

It's not funny!

Woo, yeah.

We're having some fun now,
aren't we, Morg?

It's not Morg, Cool Hand, okay?

It's me.

You take it easy?

You okay, huh?

Where are you guys?

That's all you get
for five dollars, okay, man?

We're gonna bring it in.

But are the girls clean?

Clean?

You afraid of a few bugs, son?

You afraid of disease?

What kind of aviator are you,
Razor, huh?

Well, who's on for Po City?

Checklist, yeah,
preflight, kid.

Money.

Yeah, yeah, I'm cool.

Prophylactics.

I've got two.

Oh, yeah?

I always carry 26, myself.

That's not a joke.

No shit, Razor.

It is the biggest cathouse
east of Port Said, man.

Whole town is dedicated.

Know what I mean?

You coming, Jake?

Cold beer, hot women...

Put the war in perspective.

Tell you what.

I think I'm going to
catch you guys later.

I've got something
to take care of.

Perspective.

Yeah.

Mr. Lieutenant?

Oh.

Excuse me.
Thank you.

I was looking
for Mrs. McPherson.

Sharon's gone.

Her husband was killed.

I know.

You're here on a duty call.

They send you here
to stroke the widow?

Who are you?

Callie Troy.

I'm helping pack their stuff.

The Navy pays me to help people
like Sharon.

What can I tell you,
Mr. Lieutenant?

They were here,
but now they're gone.

Like a lot people these days.

When you get in your airplane
and fly away alone,

sometimes you don't come back.

He wasn't alone.

And he did come back.

I was with him.

Commander Cole here
decided to join our posse, Jake.

This is Lieutenant
Jake Grafton--

"Cool Hand."

Glad to meet you, Jake.

How do you want
to be called, Commander?

Cole. Virgil Cole.

It's his third tour, man.

He really knows his shit.

You got the DFC and
the Silver Star, don't you?

Does it matter?

Hell, no, it doesn't matter,
Cole, Virgil Cole.

Here we are.
Home, sweet home.

Put on your wings, Jake.

You want to relax?

Hey, Jake!

Let's relax.

Ain't it great
to be home, Jake?

Some things
never change, right?

Thanks, Joe.
Hope you don't get the clap.

Give this man another beer
immediately.

Boxman, Boxman!
How are you?

Hey! All right!

When'd you get back?

Hey, Carrie, how's the baby?!

Looks just like you!

Carmen...

You didn't think

I was coming back, did you?

April, oh, my goodness,
you sweet thing.

You've been working
out, I can tell.

Come up here.

Some of them
are real dogs, Boxman.

They're all beautiful

after being with you chumps
for 57 days, right?

...gonna buy my baby
a diamond ring...

If that diamond ring
don't shine...

Get a fighter pilot to do it!

Are you a fighter pilot?

Don't ask a man
if he's a fighter pilot.

If he is,
he'll let you know.

If he isn't,
don't embarrass him.

Asshole...

Fighter-pukes make movies.

Yeah.

Bomber pilots make history.

Prove it, asshole.

Nice carrier landing!

I don't hear
your engines running!

And I don't see
your salute!

Launch the Intruder!.

Yeah! Yeah!

Bo Diddly, Bo Diddly,
have you heard?

How you doing?

Hey, flyboy...

I think you were lucky
and I lost money.

Do it again, boy.

You boys got a problem?

What's it to you?

What's it to you, nigger?

Hey, watch your mouth, mister.

You gonna stop me?

I got to go, man.

If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother knockin'

If the house is a-rockin'

Don't bother knockin'

If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother, come on in...

Watch out, Razor!

Nature calls.

Now, repeat after me.

Say, "Black is beautiful."

Hey, Jake, this place
is a drag, man, huh?

Let's go, come on.

Come on.

You get my hat?

I don't know.

I don't know!

I'm gonna throw you in, anyway.

Mess call!

Mess call!

Got room in here for a six pack
and a pizza?

Sure, sailor, okay.

Aw, man!

Shit.

I'm in shit, Morg.

Hey, Jake, hey, man.

It's the Boxman, okay?

Come on, Jake, come on.

If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother knockin'...

Come on, man!
Come on!

Oh, shore patrol!

Saved, man.

We're saved, Jake.

Emergency egress, gentlemen.

Cole, Virgil Cole,
let's go, man.

Hey, Box...

I, uh...

appreciate you getting me
out of there, man.

I know, l...

Hey, Jake, put it
down, man, okay?

Morg's gone.

Let him go.

Okay?

Have some coffee.

You going back?

Hey, my wingman Razor's

still out there... alone,
you know?

Hey...

Adios, compadre.

Thanks.

Cole.

Uh, hold on, Box.

You'll be all right,

Mr. Grafton.

I'm tactical.

I know this is foolish of me...

but I'm a little tipsy
and l, um...

I made a fool of myself earlier.

I... I was a real...

Slow down, slow down.

And I guess I owe you one.

Owe me one?

Yeah, l...

want to make it right by you.

What can I do?

Uh... okay.

Um... dance?

All right.

I want to jump, but
I'm afraid I'll fall

I want to holler,
but the joint's too small...

I make up
all my own moves!

Seems like it.

I got the rockin' pneumonia
and the boogie-woogie blues...

Yeah, I learned this
when I was a hippie!

I want to kiss her,
but she's way too tall

Young man rhythm's
got ahold of me, too

I got the rockin' pneumonia...

Tonight you're mine,
completely

You give your love so sweetly

Tonight, the light of love
is in your eyes

Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tomorrow...

Thank you.

Is, uh...

is that your daughter?

It's all right.

Where's her father?

He's scattered all over
North Vietnam.

He went out one day alone,
and the SAMs got him.

Since no one was with him

and his body
was never found,

they have him listed as MlA.

Of course, it isn't true.

You knew I was a pilot.

I married a pilot.

Didn't it make
you remember?

Maybe I wanted to remember.

Hardesty...

How's your wife?

She's fine.
She's fine, sir.

Really appreciate everything
you done for me, sir.

Nice to meet you, Mrs. Grafton.

Got a beautiful child, sir,

beautiful wife,
beautiful family.

Want to thank you again
for everything you done.

It's no trouble, Hardesty,
no trouble.

Nice to meet you, Mrs. Grafton.

"Beautiful family."

Callie, I know we don't want

to complicate things

any more than
we have to, but l...

I'd like to write to you,
if that'd be all right?

I'd like that.

It would be fine.

I'd like it very much.

Have you always been
this stupid?!

How did a person like you,
as stupid as you are,

become an aviator?!

Can you read?!

Are you that illiterate?!

This is no kindergarten!

This is no, no preschool!

Grafton!

Get in here.

You were part of this, too.

Sit down, both of you.

Now what's this crap

about you attempting
to feed a merchant seaman

to some alligators?

They were crocodiles, sir.

I don't give a damn.

Now go on.

Well, I attempted to throw

the aforementioned puke
to the crocodiles, sir,

when his belt caught on
the railing and I failed.

An altercation
then ensued, sir.

700 bucks damage,

30 men in the brig

and an alligator injured...

and you got away.

Using escape and evasion
techniques, sir,

I was able to avoid
being captured and, sir,

we didn't hurt that crocodile.

He was fine when we left.

Yeah, he was okay, skipper.

Damn it, stand up!

Who gave you permission
to sit down?

Who was with you?

I'd rather not say, sir.

That's the same thing he said.

Mr. Cole.

I couldn't help but overhear
the conversation,

and I thought
I might add something, sir.

Then go ahead, mister.

These men were victimized, sir.

"Victimized"?

Exactly, sir,
they were victimized.

We were lucky to escape.
I saw the whole thing.

Yes...

And I'm sure you'd let me know

if these gentlemen
were at fault.

That's affirmative, sir.

That'll be all, Mr. Cole.

Yes, sir.

All right.

All right,
I'll cover your asses--

both of you.

Because you told the truth,

and kept the faith.

But if I catch
either one of you

shitting in some
vital area on my ship,

you'll be keelhauled--

and that's serious
on an aircraft carrier.

Get out of here, Cool Hand.

Yes, sir.

As for you, Razor...

running with known
psychopaths now, huh?

Who am l, Razor?

You're third-generation
Mafia, sir.

Wrong!

You rodent.

I was built with this ship.

I am a weapons system,
and there was a cost overrun!

Dismissed!

Come on in.

Commander Cole.

Mr. Grafton.

Have you recovered yet?

Oh, yeah.

Uh, I saw the duty
roster out here,

and they've got us paired up.

Looks like you're
going to be my new BN.

I thought we may have
a chance to visit

for a minute.

What do you got on your mind?

Well, actually, sir,

I got the word that
this is your third tour,

and I was... I was curious.

What makes a man come back
for the third time?

I like to fight.

Have you had a lot of pilots?

Oh, four or five.

I'm kind of hard on pilots.

Have, uh...

you ever been up north?

Sure.

In the old days,
that's where the war was.

Boy, I bet... I bet
there was something up there

that really made the trip
worthwhile back then, huh?

I mean, I figure a guy like you
ought to know, huh?

There was a lot up there
worth it.

You know that.

SAMs are the scene here, man.

SAM sites are the most righteous
targets we got.

You ever fly lronhand?

No.

No, no.

No, not me.

I... I don't let them shoot
rockets at me for sport.

You get to kill them.

It's gratifying.

Yeah, but I bet
it's not as gratifying

as what was up north, huh?

I get your drift.

Don't even think about it.

Well, I just know

it's going to be a pleasure
to fly with you, Mr. Cole.

Hot dog.

Well, today's your lucky day.

The only A-6B qualified crew,
Jackson and Greeves,

were scrubbed because
they didn't have a day trap.

So your BN volunteered you
for SAM suppression.

Ever pull lronhand duty?

You fly the B?

No.

Wait a minute.

I'm not B qualified.

I've never even sat
in the damn thing.

Well, it's a good thing
Mr. Cole has.

Besides, you're all we got.

Whoa.

Do you know something
I don't know?

Maybe.

Maybe not.

Look, just relax.

I'll talk you through it.

I used to be an
instructor on the B.

The only difference is

a couple of black boxes,
and they're all mine.

So just... follow steering
and flow with it.

You see, lronhand's my thing.

It's simple.

We're the decoys.

We get them to turn their radar
on and shoot at us.

But then again,
we get to shoot back

and kill them
with our missiles.

That way, the bombers can have
a pleasant SAM-free evening

dropping their bombs.

When you shoot the shrike,
just remember not to look at it.

It'll blind you.

Otherwise, it's a simple deal.

When the SAM's radar goes on,
that's your target. You shoot.

They either have to shut off
and lose the missile

or eat the shrike.

Even if they do shut off,

sometimes the shrike remembers
where they're at.

Mean bastards, eh?

You know something?

I think that's the most I've
ever heard you say at one time.

Oh...

Look, man.

I hate SAMs.

I get all worked up
just thinking about them.

When I tell you to do something,
just make sure you do it.

Well...

I can tell this is going to be
a real love affair.

Break left.

All right, that's enough.

That's enough.

Just checking.

Devil 5-2-0, feet dry.

Roger, 5-2-0.

We copy, feet dry.

Good hunting, Cool Hand.

Let's let them know we're here.

Put your mask on,
it's going to be a gunfight.

Man, we've been made.

Give me 1 5 degrees, nose up.

A SAM just lifted off-- 1 :00.

Oh, Jesus,
there's another one!

It's not any fun until
they send up three at once.

Then we give the Gomers
our first rocket

while you dive under.

Oh, I do, do l?

Where do you get all this
confidence in my ability?

Now that's four.

Are you happy now?

Aim at the strobe.

Come on, come on.

They're going into high PRM.

Just a second.

Shoot, shoot.

Spread out, spread out left.

I told you not to look.

Hang a left and hit
the shaft, goddamn it.

Two more dead ahead.

Down.

Get your nose down!

Just another
flight-controlled radar.

Bullshit.

Look at that thread direction.

It's coming up behind us.

Maybe a conical missile scan.

That's no missile scan;

that's a MiG, baby.

Black Eagle,
this is Devil 5-2-0.

We got a bandit
crawling up our ass.

Get those F4s over here.

Expedite!

And I do mean expedite.

Now, let's get out of here.

Give me 20 degrees, nose up.

What are you, crazy, man?

That's a MiG.
We don't even have a gun.

No, but we got a shrike,
and that'll take care

of the radar site
that's guiding the sucker.

Come on, you crazy bastard.

Goddamn it, I'm going to shoot
before he gets it.

Not yet, not yet.

That's it.

Right there.

Close your eyes.

Shoot.

Righteous.

Drop your flares
and cut your heat signature.

Hard right.

Oh, God.

We got a flame out.

Engines just shut down.

We got to get power
for a restart.

Emergency generator on.

Okay, throttle up.

Here goes nothing.

A thousand feet and dropping.

You're decelerating.

Come on, come on.

Air speed 200 knots.

We're going to drop

Iike a rock at 180.

Well, then why don't you eject?

Screw it.
I came along for the ride.

Come on, you sucker, light up.

300.

Come on, baby.

250... 200.

Things are coming alive.

Yeah, we got restart.

Yeah, you beautiful, wonderful
little aerodynamic wonder, you.

Yeah!

Whoo! Flow with it, yeah!

This is X-Ray 201 and 2.

We have your bandit in tow.

He's ours, gentlemen.

Cavalry's on its way.

I've had enough fun.

Let's go home.

Wash the windows,
check the oil.

Hey, what happened
to you guys?

A couple of minutes back there
you didn't answer my calls.

Oh, that.

We had a MiG after us.

We did an engine shutdown
to throw him off.

In the middle of combat?

Whew.

Cool move.

Cool as a jewel.

That's bullshit.

I pulled back on the throttles
too much.

That was a major screw-up,
and you know it.

Well, don't worry.

It won't affect my decision.

Your what?

If you were a candy ass,
I'd ask for a new pilot,

but I figure you'll do.

Hey, Jake.

Hey, man.

Hey.

What you doing up here?

Ah, it's a good place to think.

Oh, yeah?

Me, too, huh.

I like the noise.

It's good, it's good.

What do you got there, Box?

Um...

It's just some mail,
you know, outgoing.

Is that all yours?

Well, yeah.

I got a lot of people
to write to, man.

This is only Post City,
actually.

These are my favorites.

These I like, too.

Now, wait a minute.

You had time for this
and for evaluation?

I got a lot
of responsibilities, man,

you know?

I'm a...

I'm a patriarch.

No, really.

A patriarch.

Yeah.

Want to hear something?

What do you got?

Hold on.

Wait till you hear this.

It's something else.

Listen to this.

Ready?

Yeah.

You hear that?

"Daddy."

No, no, no.

He said "daddy," man.
That's my son.

That's my son.
It's beautiful, huh?

That's your son?

How'd you know?

I don't know, and I don't
give a shit either.

He can be my son
if he wants to be.

Why not?
Sure he can. Yes.

Right? I mean,
she wants him to be.

So do l.

I mean, that's what's
important, right?

That's right,
that's what's important.

Right. Right.

What's she like?

She's butt ugly.

I mean, she's ugly,

but she's got a great body, man.

Well, you know...

You know, Jake,

I think I could love
an ugly woman.

I mean, you can trust her more.

The pretty ones...

they only care about
themselves, right?

Yeah.

Right? I mean,
you know what I mean.

Yeah, sure.

That's nice.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Thanks a lot, Jake.

Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

All right.

I'll see you around.

All right.

Mr. Grafton.

You wouldn't happen
to have anything

on North Vietnam, would you?

Like what?

Oh, I don't know.

Anything with...
maybe some maps?

Try this Geographic.

The map's in the back.

Keep it quiet.

It's not supposed to circulate.

All right. Thanks.

You want to bomb Hanoi.

You realize I could have you
court-martialed

for even making the suggestion.

That's right.

You took a big risk.

Yes, I did.

Why do you want to do this?

I think you know why.

There's guys like Morgan...

they're dying every day,
every single day.

This war...

This war's not going to end.

You think it would matter?

One plane?

Yes, I do.

It would matter to me.

I think it would matter to Morg.

It'd matter to all the other
guys that had gotten bagged.

It would matter to you,
and you know it.

So, you think putting
a couple of snake eyes

in the middle of party
headquarters is the answer?

Well, I don't know
if it's the answer,

but I'll tell you what.

It's going to get their
attention, isn't it?

You'd be going
right downtown.

It'd be no piece of cake.

Yeah, but it would be worth it.

And this time it's not going
to be a bunch of trees.

It's not going to be
a road junction.

It's going to be a
mission, a real mission.

You think it would change
anything at the peace table?

I don't know.

It might.

No dice.

I've been in this war
too long

to listen to this
idealistic bullshit.

Ah...

Let me tell you, friend,

there's nothing up there
worth dying for.

No, let me tell you something.

You risk your life.

You risk your life every
mission, every stinking mission.

I do my job.

I do my job.

Don't worry.

I'm going to forget
we even talked about this.

Dear Callie,

Last night, l...
I talked to my new bombardier

about an idea I had,

but he told me...
he told me it was crazy.

Now I'm very confused.

I know that I have to do
something about Morg's death,

but I don't know what.

Tonight we go out again to bomb
another useless target.

I miss you and little Sally.

I'll write again soon.

Jake.

All right, Jakey.

Bring it up a little tighter.

Here we go again.

Another important road junction.

Probably a couple of goat paths.

Locking down,
ground lock on target.

Okay.

Drop and try it, Jake.

Hack.

Bombs away.

All right, they're off.

Anybody see any secondaries?

Anybody see any secondaries?

I didn't think so.

Okay.

Give me some altitude.

Let's level off at 3,000.

Right with you, Boxman.

Oh, shit.

We got SAMs at 1 :00.

Okay, they launched.

Anybody see anything?

I think I saw two.

They're under that cloud bank.

You see it, Jake?

Jake!

Hard right! Hard right!

Okay, there's one left.

Uh, it just shut the radar down.

Where is the sucker? Jesus!

It's starting again.

All right, listen to me,
Box: turn into it.

Where? I can't see it!

I can't see it!

I'm hit, Jake, I'm hit!

Oh, my God, Jake!

Get out! Eject!

Punch out! Punch out!

He's gone.

Grafton.

Grafton...
you still with us?

We all miss Boxman...
but he's gone, okay?

Gentlemen...

I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Young and Mr. Reynolds.

They're the replacement
crew from Hubie.

So why don't you go ahead

and tell us a little bit
about yourselves.

Uh... I'm Lieutenant
Larry Young.

Shut up, asshole.

Well, we've got to name them.

Why don't we just call 'em
"new guys."

We used up all the good names.

Let's just call them "new guys."

New One, New Two.

Very good, Razor.

You just have such
a vivid imagination.

Movie officer,
what's the film tonight?

There's no movie,
sir, just news.

Okay, news in the ready room.

There will be a memorial service

for Box and Letto
at 1 000 tomorrow.

Dress is tropical white, long.

That'll be all.

A Swiss camera crew
in Hanoi, North Vietnam,

took this footage
of a celebration of sorts,

commemorating the defeat
of American air pirates.

Here in
People's Resistance Park,

they've set up trophies
of their victories:

grim reminders of the losses

taken in this seven-year-old war
over the North.

I'll do it.

I'll go downtown with you.

But first I want you to know
something about me.

I had a pilot
by the name of Jim Becker.

He was a good man.

We made an agreement

that if we ever went down,
one of us got hurt,

that the other guy would go on.

A SAM took us out.

We were down on the ground
for days,

sneaking around, eating bugs,
living in holes that we dug.

On the sixth day,
Becker stepped on a mine

and blew half his leg off.

I tied it off, and
he told me to go on.
