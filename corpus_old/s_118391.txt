Ow ! Wow-hoo !
Yah-hoo-hoo-hoo-ee !

Yah ! Whoo !

<i>Yeah, dude!</i>

<i>Bobby, do that again,</i>
<i>but this time don't fall down.</i>

## [ Humming ]

Aah !
Whoo-hoo-wow !

Huh ?

Do you realize going off
to college means no more...

well-meaning but totally smothering,
overprotective,

doting, ah-yucking dads ?

Yeah, well,
yours at least.

My dad's been counting down
the days until he can turn
my bedroom into a bowling alley.

Hey, we have a surefire way
to shoot straight to the top
of the freshman heap.

[ Together]
The College ''X'' Games !

First freshman team
to win it all !

First team to boot those
number one Gammas on their boot-tays !

Huh ! The Gammas
may be five-time winners,

but I hope they're ready
for a losing streak !

[ Together] Let's beat the Gammas !
Let's do it to it !

[ Cheering, Laughing ]

<i>Woo-woo-woo-woo!</i>

Gawrsh, Pete, one day
you're changin' their diapers,

and the next thing
you know...

they're all grown up
and leavin' for college.

Well, Goof,
the way I see it,

it's my last night of baby-sitting,
and I'm a free man !

Oh, yeah ! Ha-ha !
Free, free, free, I tell you !

Yah-hoo ! Ha-ha !
Come on, son.

I can't miss you
if you won't leave !

<i>Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!</i>
Yeah, free.

Hey, why don't you get the boys ?
Food's almost ready.

It's time to serve
these little babies now.

Ha-ha-ooh !

Nice rasta, pasta,
Maxman.

Ooh, Maxie's pretty good
at that boardin' stuff.

He is totally gonna kill
at college.

Huh ?

Yeah ! Yes !
[ Cheering ]

Listen, son, that there
''X'' Games fiddle-faddle...

may be all well and fun,

but remember, you're going off to
college to make something of yourselves.

Exactly.
You'll get a degree,

and the world
will be your clam.

Uh, oyster, Dad ?

No, thanks.
I'm saving room for weenies.

Now, let me show you
exactly what I mean.

Oh, no, not
the old horseshoe lecture.

You see, tossin' horseshoes
is a lot like how life works.

[ Coughs, Sputters ]

Sorry, Pete.

Uh, like I was sayin'--

[ Together] It's about
staying focused on your goals.

Right. You see,
every once in a while...

life gives you an important
tossin' opportunity.

Like, uh, well...
college, for instance !

If you want
that dee-ploma,

you gotta fix both eyes on it
like it was this here horseshoe stake.

And with the proper
''consecration''...

and follow-through,

Throw it, will ya !

<i>you should hear the clang</i>
<i>of a ringer!</i>

[ Clanging ]

Yah-hoo-hoo-hoo !
A ringer !

See, Maxie ?
You've just gotta stay focused.

Huh ?
<i>Hey, Goof,</i>

it's gettin' cold already.
[ Chattering ]

Save a weenie for me !

Hey, Peej, isn't ten hot dogs enough ?
Pass 'em over here.

Ooh, I can't wait
to get out of here.

Here, let me
help you pack.

Dad, I can do that.

I sure hope so. I'm not gonna be there
at college to pick up after you.

In fact,
it's gonna be a long time...

<i>before you see</i>
<i>your old man again.</i>

What, maybe Christmas ?

Ah, Dad,
it'll go by fast.

[ Whispering ]
Not too fast, I hope.

It's time to take charge,
live your own life.

You're a grown man now,
Maxie-Poo.

I'm not takin' ol' Stuffed Bear
to college, Dad !

Sure you are.
No.

What are you talkin' about ?
You love Stuffed Bear.

Come on. You're gonna need him.
I'm not kidding !

<i>No!</i>
[ Squeaking ]

Well, then,

I got somethin' else
for you.

[ Grunts ]
Son,

I want you to have this.

Oh ! It weighs
like a ton !

I bet it's one of those combo
TV/CD/VCR/Laptop/Scanner/Fax
things, right ?

<i>Oh, man,</i>
<i>they are so cool!</i>

<i>[ Camera Flashes ]</i>

Too stunned to speak, huh ?
No,just stunned. What is it ?

This was my father's.

And now, son,
it's yours.

Thanks, Dad.
This means a lot to me.

Oh, listen,
I'm gonna turn in.

[ Yawns ]
You know, big day tomorrow.

Good night, Dad.
Good night, son.

[ Squeaks ]

## [ Whistling ]

## [ Humming ]
Ah-yuck.

Ah-yuck.
## [ Humming ]

Did you brush your teeth ?

[ Gulps ]
Yeah, Dad.

Comb your hair ?
Yep.

Did you put on clean underwear ?
Dad !

<i>[ P.J.] Come on, Max!</i>
Oop ! Gotta go !

But, Max--

Ooh !

Goin' already ?
Gotta get there early for
freshman orientation. See ya.

What about breakfast ?

You need your three squares
a day, you know.
Don't worry.

We'll pick up donuts on the way.
Love ya ! Miss ya !
See you at Christmas ! Bye !

Don't forget to have some milk
with those... donuts.

Don't forget to have some milk
with those... donuts.

Good-bye,
my little college man.

Un, no, wait. I mean-- I don't know,

P.J., you couldn't spell Magellan.
Try hangin' a Louie.

No, no. Wait.
That's the other Louie.

Louie, Huey, Dewey ?
What're you talkin' about ?

Yo, it's right here.

Hiya, Dad.
Maxie.

Mr. Goof!
An assembly line is for assembling.

Stop daydreaming

Oh-oh-oh-oh !

Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah !

<i>Maxie!</i>

Yeah !

Look at that guy go. Oh, my gosh !
I can't look at anything else.

Whoa ! Did you see that ?

<i>[ Excited Chatter ]</i>

Well, well, well.

Look what the freshman cat
dragged in, baby. Some new meat.

Hey, easy, big fella.
That new meat looks like Gamma material.

Let's check him out.
Gammas, roll !

Ugh !
#Ta-da #

Check it out.

<i>Look who's</i>
<i>following us.</i>

[ Chuckles ]
Let's just make sure it stays that way.

[ Excited Chattering ]

<i>[ Waitress ]</i>
<i>Grande cap, extra foamy, hold the whip,</i>

<i>Iced double-tall, percent cap.</i>
<i>We have any scones ?</i>
<i>[ Man ] We got two.</i>

You guys grab a table,
I'll grab the java.

Life.
[ Clicks Fingers ]

Life is like a lime.

Hmm.
It's tart and tangy.

Sweet.
Ooh, so sublime.

[ Whispers ]
Quiet, speechless like a mime.

Bold and noisy
like a crime.

Don't you dare waste my time,

Don't you dare waste my time,

<i>[ Bobby ]</i>
<i>Bravo! Bravo! Encore!</i>

Author,

Suddenly
I'm feelin' dizzy...

with emotion.

Check it out, Bradley.
He's over there.

I'm gonna go give him
a Gamma welcome.

Ahh !
Ooh. I'm sorry, I, I--

No, no, no. No.
It's, uh, all right, really.

I'd wager that
if you were on a skateboard,
you wouldn't have spilled a drop.

[ Chuckles ]
You'd win that bet.

It's my best event.
Hi. I'm Max.

Bradley.
Bradley Uppercrust the Third.

<i>[ Man Clears Throat ]</i>
Ah, yes,

my right-hand man,
Gamma Brother Tank.

The pleasure's all mine,
baby.

Welcome aboard, little tyke.
You're class, the high kind.

Max, we have won every
College ''X'' Games competition...

since the beginning.

And we have decided to make you
our first draft pick.

Lucky you, huh ?
What do you think of that ?

No way.
You want <i>us</i> to be Gammas ?

Ha ! You guys,
you hear that ?

We're gonna be part--
<i>Hold on, pal.</i>

This reservation's
only for one.

Oh, well, I'm sorry, but P.J.,
Bobby and I are in this together.

It's all of us,
or none of me.

Max, Max, Max.

You don't wanna be weighed down
by those clowns, do you ?

I thought you wanted
to win.

Well, that's just what
we're going to do.

Ha ! Like you'll find any better
competitors than my teammates.

They're the real deal.
Serious athletes.

Check it.
Uh-huh.

[ Laughing ]
The Dynamic Dorks.

<i>Come on. The only thing</i>
<i>you three could win...</i>

is a loser contest,
baby.

[ Snaps Fingers ]

Wow, nice trick.

Do they go fetch
and play dead too ?

Why, yes.
As a matter of fact they do.

Gammas, fetch.

Uh-oh.
This can't be good.

[ Snarls ]
Back off, man.

I've got a biscotti,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

[ Nervous Laugh ]

All right, quit toying
with my emotions.

I thought
we were friends.

See, I'm giving you the opportunity
to join the Gamma Mu Mu Fraternity.

Mu, Mu ! [ Laughs ]
Who wants to join a herd of cows ?

Tank ?
Now, pray tell, sweetheart.

Would Mr. Uppercrust like a little power
wedgie for your viewing pleasure ?

Hey, leave him alone !
Huh ? Bobby !

Hey, don't worry, bro.

I'm a yellow belt.

Eee-ya ! Eee-ya !

<i>Hey, Daddy-os.</i>

<i>This is a real L-7 scene.</i>

Let's all take a trip down the road
of forgiveness and compassion.

Ooh, passion.
[ Laughs ]

I like your style, Little Miss
Mochachino, but I'm busy right now.

Well, I'm dizzy right now
from watching your downward spiral.

Ah, why don't you go off
and save some whales or something ?

Ha !

Oh, you slay me, Tiger.

You are the fly in my soup.
You are the eyelash in my eye.

You are so busy blowing out bad vibes
in every direction,

that we are all choking on your
secondhand smoke. [ Snaps Fingers ]

[ Snapping Fingers ]

<i>[ Snapping Continues ]</i>

Errr ! Knock it off!

What's wrong, Brad ?

Don't you <i>dare</i>
call me that !

Yeah. Don't forget,
he's the king, buster.

Yeah, well, we'll dethrone you
and the Gammas, your royal lowness.

Huh. You'll be lucky
to be my towel boy.

Why don't we just make
a little wager on that ?

Loser of the finals
will be towel boy to the other.

You got a deal.

Be ready to wipe the dirt
off my shoes, freshman.

Gammas, out !

Don't let the door hit ya.
Later.

Now, that's the first time
I ever saw the trash...

take itself out.

You've got the beat,
boys.

Well, you invented it,
girl.

You let your fingers
do the talkin'. Right.

<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Next!</i>

[ Tapping ]

Well, Mr. Goof,

I notice you don't have
a college degree.

Well, I did complete
three years, but--

Look, doll, I'm afraid
we can only get jobs...

for people who have
college degrees.

So, what do you need ?

What is ''a degree'' ?

Bingo ! We have a winner.

Oh, what's a Goof to do ?

Well, doll--
Uh, Mr. Goof,

the answer to your problem
is simple.

The only way to build your career
is to go back to college.

College ? Me ? I was there in the '7 0s.
I'm too old for that now.

Come on, doll. You're never too old
to learn a new trick.

''We who are godlike now
were once a mass...

[ Screams ]

<i>[ Students Laughing ]</i>

I'm just a yearnin'

Who is this goon ?

Right on, brother !
Ah-yuck !

Hey, Max, is my vision blurred...
Oh, no. Oh, no.

or does that guy
look like your dad ?

Maxie !
Kill me.Just kill me now !

Hey, Maxie,

looks like you and me
are gonna be classmates.

Ah-yuck.
He's my son.

[ Laughing ]

Daddy's little baby
couldn't be alone ?

<i>[ Laughing Continues ]</i>

Nooo !

So I got fired.
Guess I lost my focus.

Ah, Dad, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

Well, look, if you're here to stay,
I think we need to--

Focus more.
You're absolutely right.

Now that I'm with ya, I won't be
distracted no more. No, sirree.

I'm gonna get me
that college degree--

Whoa !

[ Laughing ] What a bonehead !
[ Girl ] What a loser.

Dad,
what I was saying...

is that we need to establish
some ground rules.

Well, sure.
Whatever you say, Maxie.

First thing,
lose the wig.

But I need to look
hip and groovy for college.

Dad, you're scaring people.

I know you're worried it might be hard
to get into the swing of things here,

and, well, it might be.

But I figure two Goofs
are better than one.

Two ''goofs'' all right.

Just think !
A whole 'nother year,

just you and me.

Ayear ? Did he say a year ? Tell me
he didn't say a year. I heard a year.

<i>Hold me and tell me</i>
<i>he didn't say a year.</i>

Ayear's like--
That's forever.

You realize this could
severely affect campus hijink-age.

Yeah ! And how we gonna
whip those Gammas now ?

With your dad's
''practice interruptus'' ?
Listen, guys.

Cut the old man some slack.
He has to be here.

He was fired, and he can't find
a good job without a degree.

Fired ? Whoa.

You mean like
his pink slip was showing ?

Don't push it, man.

Look, I talked to him
and laid out all the ground rules.

No interfering with
the ''X'' Games practice.

No hounding us about schoolwork.
No coming into our room unannounced.

And no acting
like a father.

Especially mine.

He's got his life,
I've got my life.

To take you to sign up
for your library card.

Dad, all new students
need one.

A-Ahem.

Good morning, gentlemen.
I am the Head Librarian,

versed in all aspects
of your school's library,

<i>including, but not limited to,</i>
<i>fiction, nonfiction,</i>

periodicals, reference
and policy.

How may I help you ?
Hi there, Miss '' Marpole-ee.''
Marpole. Marpole !

My Dad needs a library card.
Could you--

Oh, it would be
my pleasure.

We here at the college library
believe that owning a library card...

is a privilege,
not a right.

<i>Consequently,</i>
<i>we expect students...</i>

<i>to treat the Dewey Decimal System</i>
<i>with respect.</i>

You'll find these helpful
to your library experience.

[ Gasps ]
Well, I'll be !

Is that a genuine
mood ring you're wearin' ?

Well, oh--
[ Stammering ]

Yes.
Well, yes it is.

I'm a collector of'7 0s memorabilia
and such. Sort of silly, huh ?

What, are you kiddin' ?

This here's a <i>Gilligan's Island</i>
fan club seashell.

[ Gasps ]
Get out !

Do you remember the one
when the Professor built
a noncombustible engine...

out of coconut shells
and sand ?

Gawrsh, yeah,
little buddy.

[ Continues Indistinct ]
Come on ! We're supposed to be
practicin' for the ''X'' Games.

I love all that
'7 0s stuff!

Come on, we're out of here.
Oh, gosh! Remember the '' Boogie Duck''?

That was
my all-time favorite !

Quack, quack, quack, quack.
Ooh-ooh.

Quack, quack, quack, quack.
Ooh-ooh.

Here at the college library
you'll find a most-- [ Gasps ]

<i>A-A-Ahem !</i>

<i>In a library?</i>

Really !

And now, I actually think
that the Psych Department...

<i>will be most refreshing.</i>

Well, uh,
I really should be...

getting back to work.

Say, um, Miss Marpole--

Oh, you can call me
Sylvia.

Gawrsh ! Sylvia.
Ah-yuck.

I was just a-wonderin'
if maybe you'd like to--

Go out to dinner ?

Well, then maybe
afterwards, uh--

Go dancing ?
Sure !

So, if, uh--
Well, if you're free on--

Saturday ?
Oh, I'd love to. 7:00 ?

All right. Ah-yuck.
See ya then.

You know, Goofy,
you're pretty groovy.

Aw, shucks !

I'm pretty groovy.

Hey, Maxie, what if
I join your team ?

<i>We could practice together, and wear</i>
<i>them funny outfits and everything.</i>

<i>It'd be a lot of fun.</i>
Dad, as fun as that sounds,

there are no openings
on my team.

Okay ?

Mr. Goof!

Your performance was,
without a doubt,

the most breathtaking display
of alternative sport inventiveness...

yet to be parallelled
by mankind !

Gee ! Ah-yuck.
Thanks.

Whatever you said.

The Gammas, the number one team in
the history of the College ''X'' Games,

have an opening
on our team.

And it has got your name
on it, buddy !

Be a winner.
Join us.

Hey, welcome
to the team.

That's real nice of you
to ask,

but I'm really only interested
in stayin' close to Maxie.

Uh, I'm not sure you understand this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Well, ah-yuck,
I'm not sure you understand...

the bond between
a father and his son.

Guys, I have a plan.

Well, if you change your mind,
here's my card.

Gammas,
let's pack it up.

Gawrsh.
Yeah, get outta here.

Listen, Dad,
next to our team...

the Gammas are <i>the</i> team,
and they need you more than we do.

Oh, yeah, Mr. Goof.
The Gammas are like way hot, man.

Besides, we'll all still be
around each other at practices
and events all the time.

You'll have oodles of fun !

Well, son,
if you say so.

Go for it, Dad.

Hey, uh, Mr. Uppercrust,
you can count me in.

All right, then.
There you go.

Gentlemen, please.

Hey, hi.

No problem.

Oh, wow !

Me and a little crumpet like yourself...

could make beautiful

Whoa ! Easy boy.
You're foggin' up my karma.

Hey, you wanna sit with us ?
Sure.

Your cool balances out

Okay, whatever.

[ Chuckles ]
Well.

If it's all the same,
I, uh, forgot your name.

It is endemic of the current culture
that those with large stature...

<i>##I feel like dancing, dancing</i>
<i>Dance the night away ##</i>

<i>##I feel like dancing</i>
<i>Dancing ##</i>

<i>##Ah ##</i>

<i>##Ditty-ditty</i>
<i>dit, dit, de-dit ####</i>

Oh, Goofy,

this is the best night
of my life.

Mine too !

Oh, Sylvia !

Ohhh-aah !

<i>[ Sylvia Screaming ]</i>

[ Sniffing ]
Oh !

[ Kissing Sounds ]

Ohh !

Ohh !
[ Gasps ]

Hey ! What--

[ Sniffs ]

[ Gasps, Screams ]

[ Stammering ]

Aah.

I'll see you at
the qualifying rounds, freshmen !

And after, when you'll be
bringing me my towel, boy !

Ahh, this is everything
I dreamed it would be !

This place puts the ''rage''
in outrageous !

No kiddin' !
It buries what we're used to.

All right,just remember. There's
nothing here that we can't handle.

<i>Oh!</i>
<i>I seriously doubt that.</i>

We're gonna eat you alive,
freshmen !

Oh, Brad, we're quaking
on our boards.

<i>[ Sportscaster Over P.A.] Attention,</i>
<i>would Gamma Team One and Team 99...</i>

<i>report to the</i>
<i>street competition platform ?</i>

Hey, guys, that's us.
Let's do it to it.

Good luck, son !
Yeah, you too, Dad.

Hey-ho and
whaddya you know ?

Welcome to the Sixth Annual
College ''X'' Games.

<i>[ Crowd Cheering ]</i>

<i>[ Sportscaster ]</i>
<i>The contestants are gonna spin,</i>

<i>twist, lunge and plunge</i>
<i>like there's no tomorrow.</i>

Today's qualifying rounds will determine
who will compete in the semifinals !

And now, let's see what's
happening at our first venue,

<i>the skateboarders'</i>
<i>street competition,</i>

<i>from our man on the street,</i>
<i>Ken Clark!</i>

Welcome, one and all. Today--
Thank you, Ken !

<i>[ Sportscaster ] Word on the street</i>
<i>is that there's a new kid in town...</i>

<i>who poses a threat</i>
<i>to Bradley Uppercrust the Third.</i>

That's right, Chuck. And his name is--
Max Goof!

[ Chanting ]
Max ! Max ! Max !

Hey, Tank !

[ Whispering ]

This is it, man.
Your competition.

This is the big one, bro.
Stay focused.

Just like
we always do !

It's a little insurance, baby,
with no deductible.

Crazy idea.
You do the honors, Brother Goof.

Me ? Gawrsh !
Well... sure !

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>Well, well, what do we have here ?</i>

<i>Looks like there's been</i>
<i>a last minute substitution.</i>

That's right, Chuck.
Skateboarding for the Gammas is--

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>Max Goof's father, Goofy!</i>

It's patriarch and son
pitted against each other...

in a battle of skill
and dexterity.

[ Chuckling ]
This is gonna be good.

Whoo-ha-ha !
Adios, <i>compadre.</i>

<i>[ Chuck ] Not bad. Looping out</i>
<i>with a devil flip to a head butt.</i>

[ Gasping ]
<i>[ Chuck ] He's up and ready to rip!</i>

Looks like Brother Goof
needs a boost.

<i>[ Chuck ] And a huge triple flip</i>
<i>on the quarter pipe.</i>

<i>Fifty-fifty slide uphill</i>
<i>to a flip.</i>

Wow-hoo !

<i>[ Chuck ] What a lip slide</i>
<i>to a hand-plant! Whoa nelly!</i>

<i>Skating with the speed of a cheetah,</i>
<i>that is gonna be time for Goofy.</i>

<i>Oh, what a show!</i>

That's right, Chuck. Looks like
the new kid in town is no match...

for the unbeatable Gammas
and their newest member--

Goofy !

Let's see what the judges
have to say.

<i>Perfect tens across the board!</i>

<i>Except for the German judge.</i>
<i>Nine on that one.</i>

Wow !
Blown away by his own dad.

Hey, quiet !
I'm trying to concentrate here.

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>It's Max's time to skate.</i>

<i>And... here he goes!</i>

<i>Ooh! Starts out big</i>
<i>with a half cam across the box jump.</i>

Ooh ! Ahh !

<i>Losing his balance</i>
<i>to a knee slide.</i>

<i>That is going to hurt his score</i>
<i>unless he does something big!</i>

<i>Okay, comin'</i>
<i>to the quarter pipe.</i>

<i>Tail-grabs to a lip slide</i>
<i>on the rail to</i>--

[ Crowd Gasps ]
<i>Oh, that has got to hurt.</i>

Come on, Max,
get up !

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>He's okay!</i>

<i>Let's see</i>
<i>if he can end strong.</i>

<i>Quick flip into</i>
<i>a one-handed stall.</i>

<i>This is a new one.</i>
<i>I have never seen this move, folks!</i>

<i>It's back down into the transition.</i>
<i>Sit 360.</i>

<i>And... time!</i>

<i>Wowee!</i>

With barely above
a six-point average,

Team 99 just makes it
to the semifinals...

<i>by the skin of their teeth!</i>

Relax !
It's okay, man. We're in !

Get real !
<i>[ Crowd Chanting ] Goofy! Goofy!</i>

Witness, gentlemen,
victory is ours.

And most importantly,
we taught our little freshmen foes...

not to mess
with the Gammas.

Goofy ! Goofy !
Maxie !

Goofy ! Goofy !
<i>[ Goofy ] Hey, Maxie ?</i>

<i>[ School Bell Rings ]</i>

Maxie ! I've been lookin'
all over for you, son.

Where you been ?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

Save your breath !
You may have won this time, but, Dad--

Oh ! This campus just isn't
big enough for the both of us.

I didn't mean for it
to turn out this way.

I was just tryin'
to get closer to ya.

Don't you get it ?
I'm trying to get away from you !

I'm not a little kid anymore ! Now just
leave me alone and get your own life !

[ Sighs ]

Good morning, people.

It would appear that it is time
to start. You may open--

Oh, Mr. Goof.

<i>Nice of you to join us today.</i>
Huh ?

Oh, yeah.
Right.

<i>[ Professor ]</i>
<i>You may open your envelopes and begin.</i>

Let's not have
any wandering eyes.

<i>[ Chorus ]</i>
<i>##Hello, world</i>
<i>There's a song that we're singing ##</i>

<i>## Come on, get happy ##</i>

<i>##A whole lot of lovin'</i>
<i>is what we'll be bringin'##</i>

<i>## We'll make you happy ##</i>

<i>## We had a dream</i>
<i>We go traveling together ##</i>

<i>## We'll spread a little lovin'</i>
<i>And we'll keep movin'on ##</i>

<i>##Something always happens</i>
<i>whenever we're together ##</i>

<i>## We get a happy feeling</i>
<i>when we're singing a song ##</i>

<i>## Traveling along there's a song</i>
<i>that we're singing ##</i>

<i>## Come on, get happy ##</i>

<i>##A whole lot of loving</i>
<i>is what we'll be bringing ##</i>

<i>## We'll make you happy ##</i>

<i>## We'll make you happy</i>
<i>We'll make you happy ####</i>

[ Growls ]

Yah-hoo-hoo-hoo !

You're fired !

[ Horn Honking ]

I notice you don't have
a college degree.

Come on, son. I can't miss you
if you won't leave.

Whoa !

[ Groaning ]
<i>[ Max's Voice ] Get your own life!</i>

Huh ?

<i>Get your own life!</i>
Huh ?

<i>Leave me alone</i>
<i>and get your own life!</i>

[ Crying ]
<i>[ Professor ] Pencils down.</i>

<i>I said, pencils down.</i>

Wait a minute.
I'm not finished !

It's over, Mr. Goof.

<i>[ Crickets Chirping ]</i>

[ Sighs ]

## [ Humming ]
Oh, Pete !

What am I gonna do now ?

Oh, look, Goof,
it's no big deal.

All that book learning
doesn't prepare you for doodly-squat.

<i>It's useless</i>
<i>in the real world.</i>

Ha !
All them square roots,

and circumnavigating
and circumference and... bah !

It's all ''garbology.''
Lookie here.

If you know that four quarters
adds up to a simoleon, you'll survive.

<i>Anyone who tells you</i>
<i>anything different...</i>

is priming your pump.

<i>[ Pete Laughs ]</i>
<i>Take it from me, pal.</i>

<i>[ Goofy's Voice ]</i>
<i>If you want that diploma,</i>

<i>you gotta fix both eyes</i>
<i>on it...</i>

<i>like it was this here</i>
<i>horseshoe stake.</i>

That's it !
I lost my focus !

I gotta get back there
and straighten things out.

Focus !

<i>[ Car Drives Away ]</i>

Did I miss something ?

[ Clock Chiming ]

Hey, I know you !
Aren't you--

Yeah. Max.

Goofy's son !
Ahh ! He is rad !

[ Sighs ]

<i>[ Thunderclaps ]</i>

Hmm ?

Do you ever wonder why
we're always like... wearin' gloves ?

Grande cappuccino.
Make it a double.

Hey, Max !

<i>[ Waitress ] Grande cap, double it.</i>
Be here now, bro !

We thrive on the singularity
of the you that is one...

with your selfness.

That's just the
new P.J. ''speak'' for...

''Where you been,
buddy ?''

I've decided this school's
only big enough for one Goof.

I'm transferring
outta here.

<i>Excusez-moi moi?</i>
Wait a minute !

Hold it, Max ! That means
you can't be on the ''X'' Games team.

Exactly. You don't want me on the team,
anyway. I lost in my best event !

Ah, c'mon ! Hey, Maxman !
That was a one-time freak-fest.

You can beat any
of those losers any day.

I've already decided.
I'm outta here.

Max, Max, Max.
Admit defeat,

and defeat will surely admit you
into permanent custody, my man.

If I can't even beat my father,

who is probably the most
athletically-challenged man
in the universe,

how can you expect me
to beat the other competitors ?

We're starting in last place
because of me !

That never
stopped us before !

You wanna give that Gamma geek
Bradley the satisfaction
of knowing he forced us out ?

Well... no.

You wanna let the crowd who once cheered
for you cheer for someone else ?

Especially when that someone else
is your old man ?
No !

Are you gonna be
someone else's towel boy ?

No !

Together we can do it !
You're right !

We can still beat 'em !
Let's whip those Gammas !

Whoo-hoo-hoo !
Mission: Possible !

[ Together]
Let's do it to it !

[ Shouting ]

Boys... will be boys.

<i>[ Sylvia ]</i>
<i>Hmm. Stands me up.</i>

Doesn't call me, doesn't apologize,
doesn't write to me.

He could send me
a little note, something. Hmph.

Sylvia, I-- Oh, if you'd let me, I--
<i>Shh.</i>

No talking in the library.

<i>Oh, gawrsh, Sylvia.</i>

I really care
about ya.

Well, gee ! If a certain someone
truly cared about another someone,

you would think that
the certain someone would show up
for a certain special dinner,

or at least apologize
for not showing up,

or even call or something !

Ohh ! You're right.
I'm so sorry.

I let my head
get so filled up with fiddle-faddle,

that I plumb lost track of everything
that's important to me.

<i>Counting you!</i>
Oh !

Can you ever forgive me ?

Oh, how can I
not forgive you ?

Oh, Sylvia, I gotta get my grades up,
and quit those dumb ol' Gammas.

And most important--
Shh.

[ Whispering ]
And most important, get my son back.

Well, what
are we waiting for ?

I've got a yearnin'
for some learnin'. Ah-yuck !
Ah-yuck !

Huh ?

<i>[ Goofy ]</i>
<i>Sylvia ?</i>

<i>## Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ##</i>

<i>Come on,</i>
<i>you can do it.</i>

<i>[ Female Singer ]</i>
<i>##I don't wanna lose this good thing ##</i>
Go, go !

<i>## You're everything I've got ##</i>

<i>##If I do</i>
<i>I would surely ##</i>

<i>##Surely lose a lot ##</i>

<i>## 'Cause your love</i>
<i>is better ##</i>

<i>## Than any other I know ##</i>

<i>##It's like thunder</i>
<i>Lightning ##</i>

-<i>## The way you love me is frightening ##</i>
Let's do it !

<i>## You better knock</i>
<i>on wood ##</i>

<i>##Baby ##</i>

<i>## Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ##</i>

<i>## You better knock</i>
<i>on wood ####</i>

Oh !
Oh, you did it !

You did it !
Look ! All A's.

[ Sylvia Laughing ]
Whoa ?

Oh, I am just so proud
of you, Goofy.

Let's go celebrate.

Oh, you know I'd love to,

but I got a few more things
to take care of.

<i>[ Dog Barking ]</i>

So, you see,
I have to quit the team.

Excuse me ?
You what ?

No way !
What is he talking about, huh ?

Just what makes you think
you can change your mind...

on the last day
of the competition ?

Should I knock some sense
into his big melon ?

Whoa, whoa.
Down, Tank. Easy, boy.

If you're thinking you're
quitting the Gammas to join
that freshman geek son of yours,

you've got
another thing comin'.

Bull's-eye, baby. Dog-boy's in trouble,
and Daddy's gonna bail him out.

No, sirree, sir !

Ah ! Got my bunion !

I'm not gonna be
on anyone's team.

Smart man.
But you forgot one thing.

Nobody-- I repeat--
Nobody quits the Gammas !

If you were such darn winners before,
you'll be just fine without me.

I'm leavin' the Gammas,
and that's that.
You're not leaving the Gammas.

Wow-ow !

The Gammas are leaving you !
<i>Sayonara.</i>

<i>Yeah!</i> Hasta la vista, <i>baby!</i>
<i>[ Door Slams Shut ]</i>

Gee ! I think they're
a little sore at me. Whoops !

Better return my Gamma pin.

<i>[ Bradley ]</i>
<i>We'll win how we always win.</i>
<i>And how's that, Gammas ?</i>

<i>Skill?</i>
<i>Good looks ?</i>

<i>No,you dense dopes!</i>
<i>We'll cheat!</i>

[ Chanting ]
Cheat ! Cheat !

Just like we did last time,
sweetheart.

That was a great cheat.

But now
I have a better plan.

I gotta warn Maxie !

This is it, guys.

Championship time.
<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>

Oh, hiya, fellers.

Oh, heh-heh,
hi, Mr. Goof.

Gee, Max, I know
you're still sore at me,

but I came to warn you...

that the Gammas
have been cheatin' all along.
Oh, yeah !

Did Bradley tell you
to say that ?

Stop wasting my time, Dad.
I gotta stay focused.

Ooh, good luck, son.

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>Ohh, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

Put on your seat belts
and hold on to your hats. Oh, my !

<i>It's time for the high-flying,</i>
<i>gravity-defying,</i>

<i>no-time-for-crying...</i>

<i>College</i> ''<i>X</i>''<i>Games!</i>

Let's get vertical !

All righty now.

We'll begin with the eight qualifying
teams in a semifinal round...

until we're down
to the two best teams.

Then they'll be fightin'
for first place...

and the College ''X'' Games
championship !

That's right, Chuck. In the semifinals
we'll see rock climbing,

luge runs,
and much more !

Won't... that be fun !

<i>The leading team to beat,</i>
<i>as always,</i>

<i>is the Gammas!</i>

<i>Their three competitors are:</i>
<i>Bradley Uppercrust the Third,</i>

<i>Tank and Slouch!</i>

What happened to Goofy ?
We want Goofy !

What do you know, Chuck !
Looks like Goofy's a no-show.

What happened to Goof, man ?

<i>[ Crowd Booing ]</i>

Hey, Brad,
what'd you do with my dad ?

He didn't make the cut.
He was never Gamma material.

Let's go down
to the semifinal round...

which begins
with the rock climb.

What the--

Yeah ! Yeah !
<i>[ Crowd Cheering ]</i>

Whoo-whoo ! Yes !

Huh ?

[ Groans ]
Whoa !

Yea !

The semifinals have resulted
in just Team One and Team 99...

going head-to-head
in the finals.

<i>[ Chuck ] The grueling competition</i>
<i>has really taken its toll...</i>

<i>on the athletes</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

Let's strap in for our final and
deciding event: the ''X'' Games triathlon.

<i>Yes, we're seconds away from what</i>
<i>promises to be an exciting finale...</i>

<i>between these</i>
<i>two fierce competitors.</i>

Take your positions.

On your mark,
get set--

[ Blows Whistle ]
False start ! False start !

Both teams back on the line.
Get back here.

Hold on ! Bradley just blasted
our third guy into the next state.

That is absurd !
I did nothing of the sort !

That's what my dad
has been trying to tell me.

Can we get on
with the race, please ?

Wait a minute.
Uh, one, two.

You don't seem to have
enough team members now.

Do you ?
Rules are rules.

You have to field a full team,
or you forfeit to the Gammas.

That's unfair !
We don't know anyone else.

<i>Oh, seems we have</i>
<i>a little delay here, folks.</i>

<i>Team 99's short a man and will be</i>
<i>disqualified if one is not found...</i>

in just one
and one half minutes.

Dad, it's me, Max.
If you're out there--

Oh, my gosh.
Maxie's in trouble !

Dad, relax, I'm not in trouble. It's
just the team needs you. I need you.

You hear that ?
I gotta go help him !

Good thing I always carry
my lucky horseshoe.

I'm a-comin', Maxie !

Whoo-hoo-hoo !
Whoa ! Aaah !

Well, I wouldn't blame him
if he didn't come.

That's it !
They're disqualified.

Nope, nope, nope. Not yet.
There's still five more seconds.

<i>Four, three,</i>

two--

Ah-yuck !
[ Cheering ]

Come on, no fair !
He's too late !

Not by my watch.

Son, about
the last couple of weeks--

Dad, what do ya say
we take care of this race first ?

You got it !

Take your positions.

On your mark !

Get set !
[ Starting Pistol Fires ]

<i>[ Chuck ] Gammas lead</i>
<i>as they head out of the stadium.</i>

Operation Grandma up ahead.
Goody, goody.

Uh-oh ! There's pedestrians
on the course !

Gawrsh !
Sorry, ma'am.

[ Chuckles ]
Wink-wink.

Operation Hay Bale.

Isn't that Mickey Mouse
over there ?

<i>Mickey Mouse ? Where ?</i>
He's over there.

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>Team 99 cruising along.</i>

<i>Holy moly!</i>
<i>What is this ?</i>

<i>Looks like a little</i>
<i>street-skating detour.</i>

<i>Side by side, sole grinds</i>
<i>all the way down the ledge.</i>

<i>And Team 99 has regained</i>
<i>the lead!</i>

The whip, Tank !

Seven-ten split,
gutter boy !

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>Team Gamma blows right by the freshmen.</i>

The racers are approaching
the start of the bicycle leg.

<i>Gamma still holding its lead.</i>

<i>Off with the skates,</i>
<i>and on to the bikes!</i>

<i>And both teams are blasting</i>
<i>through the rhythm section...</i>

<i>with a whole lot of style.</i>

<i>The freshmen are right</i>
<i>on Team Gamma's tail.</i>

<i>Oh, look out! Bobby seems</i>
<i>to have sailed off the course.</i>

<i>What a bummer for Bobby.</i>

Bobby, you all right ?

Keep goin', Max !

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>It is really heating up now, folks,</i>

<i>as both teams are approaching</i>
<i>the huge quarter pipe...</i>

<i>to start the final leg</i>
<i>of the event.</i>

<i>Right away, Team Gamma</i>
<i>starts working the course...</i>

<i>with Team 99 nippin'</i>
<i>at their heals!</i>

They're moving off the ramp, and--
And onto the Zipper.

Huh ?

Whoa-whoa !
Yah-hoo-hoo-hoo !

[ Groans, Gasps ]

<i>[ Bradley ]</i>
<i>Tank, take him out!</i>

I will not be ignored.

Nobody finishes this race
but me !

[ Gasps ]
Maxie !

It's about stayin' focused
on your goal !

What the--
Ohhh !

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>Oh, say it ain't so!</i>

No ! I'm a-comin',
Maxie !

It's lookin' bad and it's not
gonna get prettier, folks.

<i>[ Tank Coughing ]</i>

<i>Help! Bradley!</i>

<i>Gammas, help me!</i>
<i>[ Coughing ] Anyone!</i>

<i>9 1 1, baby!</i>

[ Coughing ]
Tank, talk to me, man.

<i>Over here, man. Dog-boy,</i>
<i>am I glad to see you, sweetheart.</i>

Max, where are you ?
Where are you, Max ?

[ Coughing ]
Maxie ! Oof!

Dad, help me lift this beam
off ofTank.

[ All Grunting ]

Come on !
We're about to be Baked Alaska here.

Ladies and gentlemen,
it looks like it's all over.

<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I can't believe my eyes, folks.</i>

<i>They are alive!</i>
Huh ?

Go for it, son.

That's some kid
you got there.

<i>You're wrong, Tank.</i>
<i>He's not a kid anymore.</i>

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>Oh, Team 99 is still in this race!</i>

<i>Max Goof is making up the distance.</i>
<i>He is taking the lead!</i>

<i>Bradley's battling back</i>
<i>as they come to the finish line.</i>

<i>Team 99 wins!</i>
<i>Oh, I am stunned, folks!</i>

<i>I just can't</i>--
<i>I can't believe</i>--

<i>I can't even finish</i>
<i>my sentences.</i>

<i>Oh, my!</i>
<i>What a day!</i>

Ah-yuck !
[ Hiccups ]

Congratulations, son !

[ Clears Throat ]
Congratulations, Max.

I haven't forgotten
our agreement.

The bet's off, Bradley.

But I think
you owe him something.

<i>[ Tank ]</i>
<i>Brad!</i>

Hi, it's me,
the guy ya let down.

Hey, Tank, baby !
Who loves ya, baby, huh ?

You're goin' down like
a four-cent pair of socks.

You and me, baby,
all the way !

Oh ! A vacancy
at the Gamma house.

Takin' applications.

Okay, okay, let go of me,
you big fat jerk !

Time to get
on the last jet to nowhere !

<i>[ Chuck ]</i>
<i>No, it doesn't look good now.</i>

It's like I'm in a bad dream,
and it just won't quit.

That's right, Chuck.

Congratulations, Dad.
Here.

Gawrsh, son,
what's this ?

You gotta open it
to find out.

But... this is yours.

No, Dad.

This is for you.
Read the inscription.

''I might not be
your little boy anymore,

<i>but I'll always be</i>
<i>your son.</i> ''

<i>[ Bobby ]</i>
<i>Okay, okay,</i> ''<i>hugfesters.</i> ''

Free eats
back at the dorm-a !

Pizza !

Double cheese-a !

Mmm-mmm.
Scrumptious !

Come on, Dad. Let's feast.
<i>[ Car Horn Honking ]</i>

Sorry, son, but
I kinda got plans of my own.

I'm really gonna miss you.

Sure, it was rough for us
at the start,

but, well, it turned out to be a pretty
cool thing, you here at college with me.

But now it's over and we'll go on
with our own lives and--

You didn't tell him yet ?
Didn't tell me what ?

I wanted
to surprise him.

Son, guess what !
I got me a job here on campus.

But you--

So I could be close to you !
But I thought you were--

You told me you were gonna--
-Just kidding.

[ Laughing ]

[ Laughing ]
He is so goofy !

What do you say we go for--
A picnic ?

Ah-yuck.
Then maybe even a--

Walk on the beach ?
I'd love to.

You know,
somehow I knew you would.

Ah-yuck !
