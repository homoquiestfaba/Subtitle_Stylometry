â™ª Heavenly shades of night
are falling â™ª

â™ª It'â€™s twilight time â™ª

â™ª Out of the mist,
your voice is calling â™ª

â™ª 'â€™Tis twilight time â™ª

â™ª When purple-colored
curtains â™ª

â™ª Mark the end of day

â™ª I'â€™ll hear you â™ª

â™ª My dear,
at twilight time â™ª

â™ª Deepening shadows
gather splendor â™ª

â™ª As day is done

â™ª Fingers of night
will soon surrender â™ª

â™ª The setting sun

â™ª I count the moments,
darling â™ª

â™ª Till you'â€™re
here with me â™ª

â™ª Together at last

â™ª Here

â™ª In the afterglow of day

â™ª We keep our rendezvous

[radio static]

[horn honking]

[honking continues]

[tires screech]

[tire blows out]

[wipers click]

[engine fails]

[peels out]

[winds gust]

[door slams]

Aah!

[brakes screech]

My God, are you all right?

It was that crazy guy.

There is no other
explanation for it.

I'â€™m telling you,

my stars said
something about...

me having
a weird day today,

but I don'â€™t believe
that stuff.

Do you?

My God, you can'â€™t
get out of this city

to have a nice, easy day

and look what happens.

Oh.

What do you think
he wanted?

Am I talking too much?

If he was crazy,
he probably

didn'â€™t want
anything,

and it'â€™s
perfectly normal

to want to talk over
a traumatic experience.

Is there a cloth?

Sure.

I'â€™ve got some
in my bag.

I'â€™m sorry about
your shirt.

Don'â€™t worry.

No, you kidding?

Worrying
is my specialty.

It'â€™s what I do.

Well, it'â€™s not
exactly what I do.

I work
for a law firm,

selling insurance.

Insurance, huh?

Oh.

Well, with the way
the world'â€™s falling apart

nowadays, you need all
the protection you can get.

Right?
I guess.

Why don'â€™t you try
starting it now?

Oh, I can'â€™t.

It'â€™s broken. I'm sorry.

Oh, well--

Well, isn'â€™t there some
other way to fix it?

I mean, with the wires,
you can do something.

I don'â€™t know.
You'â€™re the mechanic.

Mechanic?

God, no. I'â€™m a doctor.

What?

Why, do you have
a problem with that?

Some people do.

No, I mean--

Uh,
my dad'â€™s a doctor.

That'â€™s how he
met my mother.

He saved her life.

That'â€™s quite a story.

It'â€™s not a story.

Well, I have to get
to Pear Blossom tonight,

so if there'â€™s
anything you can do,

if there'â€™s a chance
that you can help me out--

Otherwise, I'â€™m stranded
in the desert,

you know what I mean?

We can flip for it.

Thanks.

Do you have anything
cold to drink?

I'â€™m dying.

In my car,
there'â€™s an ice chest.

Help yourself.

By the way,
I'â€™m Sandra Thomas.

Hi, Sandra. Jake Nyman.
How do you do?

You tell me.
You'â€™re the doctor.

You'â€™re doing just fine.

Insurance, huh?

I oversimplified my
position just a bit.

And it'â€™s more
than just insurance.

It'â€™s investment bonds
and stock market trade,

equity, you know.
A lot of big money stuff.

Sounds impressive.

It'â€™s nothing.

Oh, by the way,

I found that in your car.

The car'â€™s back
down the road
about 7 miles,

so it'â€™ll need a tow

and someone who can change
an ignition switch.

It'â€™ll need
a door fixed, too.

Driver'â€™s side.

Well, my nephew Ike
has a tow truck.

He can go fetch
the lady'â€™s car.

But if you want
to get the door fixed,

you'â€™re going to have
to go up the road,

talk to Pear Blossom.

Pear Blossom?

Yeah, you know it?

I'â€™m going to--

I was going to spend
the night there.

That'â€™s all.

Oh. My wife says

that she thinks
God created that place

so that he could go
and rest sometimes.

These butterflies
belonged to my wife.

Oh.

Would you like
something to eat?


I have a microwave
in the back

I could put some bread in,
make some toast.

After we eat,
I could take you

and your car
up to Pear Blossom.

Uh, no charge,
of course,

you being a lady.

I don'â€™t know.

What do you think,
Jake?

I think he'â€™s right.

I think you are a lady.

Great. Great.

Then I'â€™ll have Ike
kicked in the ass, and--

Oh, I'â€™m sorry.

Sorry.

He has a car number.

I have to remember that.[rustling]

Well, thank you
for everything.[man dialing phone]

It'â€™s not often a girl
gets to meet a white knight.

Your wife
is a very lucky woman.

I'â€™m not married.

Oh, well.


If you leave me
your address,

I can at least
replace that shirt.

No, it'â€™s not necessary.

On, no, no.In fact, I owe you
for the door.

No, no.
Well, sure I do.

I insist.
No, honestly.

Let me replace that.It'â€™s truly nothing.

It'â€™s just a shirt.Oh, please.

Quiet!No--

No. I'â€™m trying
to find him.

Do you have
a restroom here?

Okay, Sandra, straighten up.

You don'â€™t even know this guy,
and you'â€™re coming on to him

like a steam train.

So just calm down,
all right?

That'â€™s it.

What is your problem?

I'â€™ll tell you
what your problem is.

Oh.


You'â€™re alone.

You think 400
will cover the damage?

I can leave more.Oh, no, no, no.

That'â€™s fine.
That'â€™s fine. You--

You know...

there'â€™s nothing that, uh--

that an older guy
like me wouldn'â€™t do

to spend some time
with a pretty women,

but that--
that lady friend of yours,

I think she--
she would appreciate it

if you would
drive her over there

to Pear Blossom
personally.

Okay.

Uh, no.

She would appreciate it
if you would drive her
over there...

personally.

So the guy comes
out of nowhere,

saves your life--
big deal.

Now, you just get real,
Sandra dear,

because by tomorrow,

you won'â€™t even
remember his name.

Bye-bye, Jake.

Oh, don'â€™t even
think about it.

Oh...




Hey, Sandra.

What--
Are you all right?

That crazy guy,
he is back.

I-- What?

Right behind the house.

Are you sure?Sure I'â€™m sure.

I just almost fell over
his goddamn car.

Please, Jake,
let'â€™s just go.

Oh, God.
Oh, look at me.

I'â€™m shaking.

[laughs nervously]You'â€™re all right.

Shaking'â€™s just
a natural reaction.

You'â€™ll be fine.Oh.

[lighter clicking]

Mm. Mm-mm.


Wowee, that was wild.

Are we there?

We ran out of gas.

I didn'â€™t
want to wake you.

Oh. That'â€™s okay.

Excuse me.
How long has it been?

74 minutes.

74 minutes? Christ.

Might as well face it.
We'â€™re dead.

No one'â€™s going to come.

Sure, someone'â€™s
going to come.

I had a patient that
did this all the time.

Someone always
picked him up.

What were you
treating him for,
complete stupidity?

He'â€™s a professor
of mathematics,

and a very good guy,

till he woke up one morning

convinced his entire life

was one huge, inescapable

mathematical equation.

Huh.

So he took up hitching.

Well, that makes sense.

He thought a little
random adventure

might throw a wrench
in the works.

Did it?

You could say that.

His name was Max Tinder.

He killed seven people
in 11 days.

What kind of doctor
are you?

A truck.

Oh, my God![honking horn]

He'â€™s pulling my car!
Jake!

It'â€™s my car!
It'â€™s my car![continues honking

My God, did you see that?

I mean, what is it
with me today?

What is my problem?

Wrong place, wrong time.

That'â€™s all.
Don'â€™t take it personally.

[both laughing]

I was just joking, really.

Really?
Yeah.

Oh, to relieve
the tension.

What tension?

[both laughing]

Ahh.

I can take rejection.
I'â€™m a very big girl.

No, it'â€™s--It'â€™s just been
one of those days.

It'â€™s just that
it'â€™s getting late,

and we'â€™ve got
responsibilities,
remember?

No, I don'â€™t remember

because I don'â€™t have
any responsibilities.

I'â€™ve been lying, okay?

I just work for a stupid
little collection agency.

Or at least I did
until my boss sacked me

after he screwed me,
of course.

What about Pear Blossom?

Oh, Pear Blossom.

There I'â€™m going to pick up
my stupid sister,

and we'â€™re going to drive
the rest of the way
to Utah together.

Since Dad died, she'â€™s all
Mom can think about.

And I can bet you

that she
won'â€™t even turn up.

You can. How come?

Because Alice is a loser.

Last year,

I wasted two whole days
in the middle of nowhere

just waiting for her
to show up.

Found out later
she shacked up

with some junkie musician type
halfway through Nevada.

But that'â€™s Alice for you.

Never gives a shit
and has all the fun.

She'â€™s the one
who makes me smoke.

I guess that'â€™s why I lied.

Just to make things
a bit more exciting.

I don'â€™t know.

I must sound like
a complete head case,

especially to someone
like you.

To someone like me...

you sound perfectly normal.

Well, no one'â€™s perfect.

[both chuckle]

[vehicle approaching]

Okay, buster,

you just try getting
past me this time.

You know, Sandra--Oh, no, no, no.
I'â€™m okay, I'm okay.

I tell you--

Get out of the road,
Sandra.

It'â€™s a bad habit.

Oh, I'â€™ll kick it
when I settle down
and have kids.

Wait--Shh!

Wait!

Where are you going?
Sandra--

It'â€™s him. It's him.

It'â€™s the crazy guy,
the one that wants me dead.

Sandra, wait a second.

First of all,
you don'â€™t know
that he'â€™s crazy.

Second of all,
if he wanted you dead,

he wouldn'â€™t have stopped,
would he?

He would have run
right over your head.That'â€™s not the point.

What is the point?

It'â€™s not the money,
is it?What money?

The money you took
out of his car.

Shit.

I'â€™ve never done anything
like that in my life.

I want you
to believe that, Jake.

On top of everything today,
I'â€™ve become a thief.

And you always thought
I was a normal person.

You are a normal person.

Stealing money
is a perfectly normal action.

Not for me it isn'â€™t,
Jake. No.

Normal people do not
go into some guy'â€™s car

and steal a load of cash.

Of course they do, Sandra.

Otherwise we wouldn'â€™t
be seeing a 17% increase

in domestic white-collar
dysfunctionalism, would we?

What are you talking about?

All over America, sane people
doing insane things--

things they never thought of,
never dreamed of.

Irrational, illogical,
unpredictable, random things.

Professional people
just like you or me
or even him.

It doesn'â€™t matter whether

it'â€™s a good thing
or a bad thing.

Just as long as it makes
something happen,

something they haven'â€™t had
to plan half their lives.

It'â€™s like taking
a vacation.

Don'â€™t you see?

No, that doesn'â€™t sound
very scientific.

It'â€™s not scientific.

It'â€™s not about science.
It'â€™s not about economics.

It'â€™s about...chance.

That'â€™s where the real
possibilities lie.

Even a scientist
can'â€™t tell you
that this thing

is going to turn
this way or that way.

And to me, that'â€™s--

that'â€™s really neat!

You really did it,
didn'â€™t you?

What?

Back at the car.

You really did flip a coin
to see whether to pick me up.

That'â€™s really neat.

Should we do it again?

No, no. Just once.

That'â€™s the whole point.

Oh. Okay.

Just remember not to tell him
that I recognize his car

or that, uh,
I stole his money.


I can'â€™t believe
I'â€™m saying this.


He says he wants
to chop us both up

with a hatchet.

He did?

No, he didn'â€™t say that.

It was a joke.

To relieve the tension.


Come on.

You sure
this is cool, Jake?

I told you,
professionally speaking,

I detected no obvious
signs of danger.

And what about
unprofessionally?

Unprofessionally,
if there'â€™s a problem,

we can always kill him.

Just kidding.

[engine rumbling]

[doors opening, closing]

Do you like jokes?

I heard this wonderful joke
last night.

I was having dinner
with his, um...

Well, anyway.

What'â€™s got six legs,
four eyes, and half a kipper?

No, no, that'â€™s wrong.

Uh, six legs, four eyes,
and two tails?

I don'â€™t know.Half a kipper.

No, that'â€™s wrong!

What am I talking about?

A man on a horse
holding half a kipper.

[Jake chuckles]

With a bum off,
obviously...


It'â€™s very effective
when it'â€™s, uh...
performed right.

You know.

[clears throat]

Do you like music?

Yes, sir.

It'â€™s great, isn't it?Mmm. Mmm.

That'â€™s quite a bang
you'â€™ve got, Mr...

Oh, Santini.

I mean, there,
on the side of your car.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

This, uh, crazy woman
back there

tried to force me
off the road.

Can you believe it?

I was trying to give back
her cigarette lighter.

She left it behind
in the cafe.

That'â€™s quite nice.

It don'â€™t even
work proper.

Why bother?

You know,
I was gonna stop

and talk the whole thing
over with her,

but I thought,
well, no, no.

Crazy enough to ram me,
crazy enough to carry a gun.

Right?

Scared the bleedin'â€™
life out of me.

I had to stop, pull over,
clean me windows.

That'â€™s why I don't usually
pick up hitchhikers no more.

Just not safe.

Not after that, um,
Tinder bloke.

Max Tinder,
him all over the telly.

Huh. You hear about that?

He'â€™s a little off,
isn'â€™t he?

I'â€™ll tell you,

it'â€™s getting like you can't
trust nobody these days.

Present company excepted,
of course.


Is Santini your real name?

No.

Do you like music?

Yes, very much so.
Thank--

Here, listen to this.
You won'â€™t know this.

If music be
the food of love...

[inserts cassette]

What'â€™s that?Uh, play on?

Play on. That'â€™s it.
Yeah, yeah.

Play On. â™ªâ™ª [Irish flute]

Oh, listen to that.

It'â€™s beautiful.

Makes me want to cry.

Still, where would we be
without a few tears, eh?

[no audible dialogue]

Anyway...

I'â€™d like you both
to be my guests

for a lovely bit
of dinner.

Do you fancy that, eh?

I'â€™ll book us in, then.Need any help?

Oh, no, no.
It'â€™s my treat.

I'â€™ll see you
in the diner.

Yes. Over there,
darling.

All right?

Oh! Oh! My finger!
Oh! Oh!


Come on, Jake.
It'â€™s over there.

[ding ding]

Hi, sweetie.

Can I help you?

Yes. Has an Alice Thomas
checked in tonight?

I'â€™ll have to look
at the book.

Thomas, Thomas,
Thomas, Thomas.

She a friend?

No. My sister.Oh.

â™ªâ™ª [country]

So, uh,
what do you think?

About what?

Well...
[clears throat]

if you wanted to change
a hundred dollar bill,

who do you ask?

A hundred dollars?
Nobody. Not here.

Not a hundred.

I'â€™ll be right with you, sir.

Well, I just need
the nearest thing.

What about her?

Don'â€™t be silly.

Couldn'â€™t fit change
for a hundred

in those shorts.

What about him?
The geezer in the gold?

Doesn'â€™t look like
real gold to me.

Well, who, then?

Try the cop.

Why the cop?

He'â€™s out to impress.
Wouldn'â€™t want to look cheap.

Keep going.

Still wearing
the uniform.

That'â€™s not doing
the trick.

Logical to assume he might
embrace the opportunity

to demonstrate
his alternative
sensitive side

with a random act
of kindness.

Like helping a stranger out
with a bit of change.

Of course,
there'â€™s nothing
random about it.

Anything else?

My mom always said,
"Jakie, ask a policeman."

No. Sorry, dear.

There'â€™s nobody here
by that name.

Doesn'â€™t matter.
Didn'â€™t think so.

Do you have
any rooms left?

Sure. How many
would you like?

May I have a coin?

Yes. Indeed.

Um, excuse me, Officer.

I have a small problem.

I wonder if you could
help me out.

You see, my mother
always told me to, uh...

well, ask a policeman.

I know exactly
what you mean.

[clears throat]
Excuse me.

What do you need?

Well, what everybody needs
from time to time.

A little change.

You'â€™re in my seat.

You a movie star?

No. I'â€™m a doctor.

Oh.

[bell tingles]

I'â€™m sorry
I was so late,

but it'â€™s a busy night
tonight.

I could only
get us one room.

It'â€™s big, two beds.

But if that'â€™s a problem,

we could always hang
a sheet between them.

Like in the movies.

Oh, the movies.

I like the movies.

Jake here could be
a movie star.

He'â€™s handsome enough.

This is, uh...

Shirley.

"Shirl" to my friends.

Hi, Shirley.
I'â€™m Sandra.

I'â€™m with him.

Oh, no.

I saw him first.

Didn'â€™t I, Jake?

Put any two cards down?

Is this a trick or what?

No, no, no.
Actually--

No. I mean,
are you trying to get--

Oh!Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

I'â€™m always doing that.

Lucky it wasn'â€™t
boiling coffee.

Forget it.

Take care
of yourself, Jake.

Maybe we'â€™ll meet again
on the other side.

So are you folks
ready to order now?

Our specials this evening
are the Dover Sole

with wild rice
and baked carrots,

and Lemon Chicken
with asparagus spears.

One of each.
We can share.

Yes, ma'â€™am.

What'â€™s up, Doc?

Powerless without
your little silver coin?

Don'â€™t know.


You know, I like you.

How'â€™s my little
love birds tonight?

All right? Eh? Eh?

Ready to gulp down
a bit of solid food?

Not tonight, Mr. Santini.

I don'â€™t think we'll be having
dinner together tonight.

It'â€™s on the house.

I said fuck off.


Now, look-- look, Jake,

I don'â€™t know
what the problem is,

but I was just having a word
with the officer over there.

Nice man. He helped me out
with a bit of change.

And I told him
I'â€™d be dining with friends.

Now, what'â€™s it going
to look like

if I suddenly
scoot out the door, eh?

I don'â€™t understand.
What'â€™s going on?

What'â€™s going on
is our friend here

makes his living
out of cheating people.


Now, God bless you.
What, that?

That was a bit of fun.

A couple of games
of chance, that'â€™s all.

A game of chance
does not employ a bias

favoring one
or more parties.

What you'â€™re operating
is a confidence trick--

a system disguised
as a opportunity,

which makes you
just another liar.

All right.

How'â€™s about practicing
a bit of what you preach?

How'â€™s about giving
a bloke a chance?

I mean,
I'â€™m not a bad man.

Know what I mean?

If you win,

we finish our dinner,
go our separate ways,

quietly
and without incident.

How do you feel
about that?

Oh, I feel a lovely
warm tingle in my gutty-wuts.

Now, what'â€™s the damage
if I lose?

You pay back the cop.

Plus ten percent.


What?
You his agent now?

Seems like
a suitable figure.

No, I'â€™m not doing this.
This is bloody stupid.

Heads or tails?
Tails.

No, it'â€™s going
to be heads.Makes a difference

when you don'â€™t know
what'â€™s next, doesn't it?

Yeah, except--

Heads. All right?

Hey. See what happens
when you'â€™re a nice guy?

Congratulations.
Let'â€™s eat.

All right.
Now it'â€™s my turn next.

Three in a row.

And if it'â€™s not heads
every time,

I'â€™ll get on this table
and lap dance

while the cop'â€™s
putting the cuffs on me.

Please give me back
the coin.

But if I win...

you pay me back
the thousand dollars

that your girlfriend
stole out of my car.

Plus ten percent.

Jake.

Seems like
a suitable figure.

You still don'â€™t
get it, do you?

It'â€™s not about
winning or losing.

It'â€™s about chance.Three in a row.

That'â€™s the promise.
Now shut it.

But you can'â€™t say that.Oh, I thought I just did.

Must be those bleedin'â€™ voices
in my head again.

Well, I don'â€™t want to say
I told you so,

but I told you so.

Real chance defies
the inevitable.

That'â€™s what
the coin'â€™s all about.

So what'â€™s the problem?

Go ahead.

Embarrass me in front
of my loved ones.

[coin spinning]

See, what you don'â€™t
understand, Jake,

is you can spin
that bleedin'â€™ coin

as many times as you like,

but you still can'â€™t defy...

[coin spinning slower]


Excuse me.

[toilet flushes]

Oh.

One of us
is in the wrong room.

Probably me. Usually is.

Whoa.

Don'â€™t suppose
you want to make it
double or quits?

Jake.

How'â€™d you like to take
a nice little girl like me,

just stick her
in the trunk of your car...

take her
out of this place?

Just pull me out
whenever you want
to play, and...

Jake...


Jake.

Sandra?

Are you okay?

You look upset.

Why should I be upset?
Just because you--

I thought you
were different.
I really did.

From what?

From the kind of guy

who gets off
with the town whore.

Speak of the devil.

I think she
needs a doctor.

I think she'â€™s
already had one.

Sandra,
I think you'â€™ve got
the wrong idea.

Don'â€™t...
touch me!


Don'â€™t...
touch me.


Fucking men!

Oh, this is great!
Look at this.

Is that
the kind of woman
you really want?

Is that the woman

that I am supposed
to be competing with?

Some...
drunken tart

that can'â€™t
even hold down
her...dinner?

She'â€™s just
a stupid fucking--

fucking--

Aah!


Ha ha.[dog barks]

I think "cunt"
might be the word
you'â€™re looking for.

You--


Come on, darling.

There you go.

Ohh...


[sobs loudly]

Did you see
what he did to me?

Did you hear
what he said to me?


Jake.


Just don'â€™t stand
there like that.

Please.

Don'â€™t you know
what'â€™s going on?

No, I--
I don'â€™t. What?

They'â€™re in it
together.

The whole thing
with the coin.

It was just
another trick.

Like with the cop.

To get you
away from me.

Don'â€™t you see?

He did it for her.

He did what?

He switched the coin.

It was a fake.

A what?

Ohh...

You always said
you'â€™d look after me.

You even joked
about killing him.

Is that what you want?

I just don'â€™t
want him ever...

to talk to me
like that again.

Okay.

Okay.

Heads, I kill him.

Tails...

I make sure
he never talks to you
that way again.

â™ªâ™ª [woman, ecclesiastical]

â™ªâ™ª [woman, ecclesiastical,
percussion beat]

Hi, Mom.

No. It'â€™s me-- Sandra.

Yeah. I know.
I'â€™m sorry. It's late.

Mom.

Mom! Mom.

Listen.

I might not be able
to make it tonight.

Yeah, I know.

Yeah.

Well...
I had car trouble.

[door opens]

Hi.

How'â€™d it go?

Fine. I just gotta
get cleaned up.

[door closes]

â™ªâ™ª [woman chanting]

â™ªâ™ª [percussion,
woman chanting]


[breathes passionately]

[sighs
contentedly]

No one'â€™s ever done
that to me before,
Jake.

I mean...no one'â€™s
ever made me come
that way.

I'â€™ve never met
anyone like you.

Never.

Ever!

Ohh, I could float away
into the sunrise

and become one
of those contented sighs
that...

you can hear whispering
through the trees.

And I'â€™d be happy.

Just like
when my father...

used to hold me
in his arms

and tell me how much
he loved me...

tell me
stories about...

hunting bears

and long fishing trips
and...

I'â€™ll never forget him.

I don'â€™t want to...
go back.

I don'â€™t want to be
Sandra Thomas anymore.

I'â€™d rather die.

I'â€™d rather...

I'â€™d rather be
with you.

What do you think?

I'â€™ll flip you
for it.

[coin clinking]

What was it?

What was what?

The coin. What side
did it fall on?

Why?

Because...

my breakfast
depends on it.

Alice,

huh? That'â€™s nice.

Like
Alice in Wonderland.
I like that.

Are you finished
with this?

Knock
yourself out.

You sure?

Your stomach'â€™s full
and everything?

Thanks.

Gee, when was
the last time
you ate?

I eat when there'â€™s food.

It'â€™s kind of like
an unscheduled habit...

if you know what I mean.

Maybe you'â€™ll kick it

when you settle down
and start having kids.

You know...[laughs]

you sound
just like my sister.

Your sister?

Yeah.

Sandra.

I'â€™m meeting her here.

She hasn'â€™t arrived yet,
but she will.

She'â€™s good with time.

Probably just had
a little car trouble.


Her car wouldn'â€™t dare.

Hi. Mom?

Yeah, it'â€™s Alice.

Yeah, listen.
I was just, um...

checking in to see
if Sandra'â€™s called.

Well, I'â€™m supposed
to meet her.

What?

Car trouble?

29, 30,

20'â€™s 50,
and 50 100.

Thank you.

You want matches?

Nope. Got 'â€™em.

Have a good day.

You, too.

Sorry I'â€™m in your car.

Forgive me?

I don'â€™t understand.

Well, my sister'â€™s
not gonna make it.

She'â€™s having car trouble,
just like you said.

And, uh, the last truck
pulled out of here.

I can drive.

I mean,
I like driving,

if it'â€™ll-- it'll help.

You look
kinda tired.

I'â€™m sorry. I-- I just
don'â€™t pick up hitchhikers.

It'â€™s not safe.

Safe? Oh,
I wouldn'â€™t hurt you.

I couldn'â€™t. [chuckles]


I'â€™ll flip you for it.

Done already.

What?

Heads or tails?

You'â€™re either gonna be
a cat man or a dog man.


And what was I?

You think I'â€™d get
in the car with a dog man?

Hello. Maid service.

[knock knock]

Hello!

[tires screeching]

Goodbye, LTD.



Please, God,
don'â€™t let me
break his car.


What was that?

I don'â€™t--
I don'â€™t know!

There was a man ri--
in-- in-- in a car.

What are you
talking about?

[tires screeching]

[tires screeching]


[car alarm beeping]

Did you see that?

Yeah.

Where you going?
I'â€™ve gotta go
out there.

You can'â€™t go out there.
It'â€™s not safe.

Safe? But he--

Alice.
The man attacked us.

If it hadn'â€™t been for you,
we'â€™d be the ones
out there in the dirt,

and he'â€™d be the one
halfway to Utah by now.

Maybe you'â€™d like him
to meet your mother.

No. It'â€™s...
not right.

Alice!
Not right.

Aah! Aah!

Let go of me!

Let go of me!

Uhh! Let go of me!

Let go!

Let go of me!

Let me--[shouts, coughs]

Ohh...

Oh, my God!

[grunting painfully]

Uhh!

Come on.Why?

[spitting blood]

Why?

[gurgling, sobbing]
What have you done...

[gurgling, spitting]


Uhh!

Uhh! [sobs]

You'â€™re not--

I'â€™m not who?

Who?


Uh...


I'â€™m... not...

a bad man!

[sobs, chokes]



Don'â€™t die!

Please!

Oh, God!



He'â€™s dead.

I'â€™m sorry.

Didn'â€™t you hear
what I just said?

He'â€™s fucking dead, Jake.

I heard.

Hop in.

But we'â€™ve got
to get to a phone!

I mean, we'â€™ve...

we'â€™ve got to call
the official people.

Well, you--

They'â€™ll know
what to do.

Okay.
First place we pass.

First place we--
The first place
we pass could be--

It could be
hundreds of hours
away from here, Jake!

We'â€™ve gotta go
back to town now!

No.

What?
I can'â€™t let you.

What do you mean,
you can'â€™t let me?

I just killed a man!

I just killed
a human being!

Exactly,
and they'â€™ll have you

sweating over
your own guilt
in ten seconds

flat.
Guilt?

I'â€™m innocent!
Oh, come on!

It was an accident!

You'â€™re from
out of town.

Don'â€™t you see?
You'â€™re just
passing through.

You never spend
enough time
in one spot

to keep a job down!

You are unbelievable!

Do you think
they'â€™ll care one bit

about your side
of the story?

Christ, woman,
you'â€™re a-- you're
a natural victim!

What makes you think

that you know
anything about me?

I don'â€™t. I just...
know your type.

Ohh! Fuck you!

Fuck you!

All right.
I know. I'â€™m sorry.

It was irrational
and stupid.

Alice, wait.
Listen.

We'â€™ll flip for it.
Alice.

Heads, we go on.

Tails, we head back
and face the music.

I'â€™ll even go back
with you. Come on.

Uhh! That'â€™s what
I think of that!

I'â€™ll do it
by myself![horn blares]

[horn blaring]

[Radio host]
Hi. This is Chad Summers
with a KRBT news update,

and hot on the wire
for this afternoon

is the discovery
of a woman'â€™s body

at the Pear Blossom Motel
in Pear Blossom.

The victim, a woman
in her thirties,

was found dead in a room
earlier this morning.

Police are still
investigating the scene

and treating the find
as suspicious.

More news as
it becomes available...

Sandra.

Back up! Back up!

Get back
in the car right now.

You hear me?
Get over there,
folks.

Just back up.
All right?

This is not
a goddamn circus.

Hey. Hey. Hey.
Where you goin'â€™?

That'â€™s my sister!Ho! Ho!

Let me go!Where you goin'â€™?

That'â€™s my sister!No! I don'â€™t care
who it is!

You don'â€™t
understand!You--

Young lady--That'â€™s my sister!

All finished, Frank.

All right,
Miss Thomas.

Let'â€™s see if we can
straighten this thing out.

Now, you'â€™re
at the motel...

waitin'â€™ for your sister
to show,

and when
she doesn'â€™t show...
you hitch a ride.

Before you know it,
some lunatic is trying
to run you off the road.

He ends up getting
himself killed.

But before he dies...

he gives you
this lighter...

which you claim
is your sister'â€™s.
That right?

Right
around then...

you learned about
this motel murder
business.

And you figure
he got it off of her.

Right?

It'â€™s her lighter.

Mm-hmm.

It always
takes three tries.

Miss Thomas,
how old are you?

I'â€™m 25.


Ain'â€™t that
a hell of an age

to be looking
for a free ride?

Is that against
the law around here?

Only the law
of common sense.

I ain'â€™t saying it's wrong.

I'â€™m only saying
shit happens.

And you got to
take it into account.

I always take that
into account.

Alice, the woman
in the morgue
is not your sister.

What?

Her name is
Shirley Dutton.

The only step she ever took
out of Pear Blossom

brought her right back,

each time
a little more
busted up.

Sammy.Yeah.

Gimme that folder.

Now...

the fella you had
the misfortune of meeting...

goes by the name
of Santini.

Now, we already have
a bunch of witnesses,

including my deputy,

putting them together
from around 9:30
last night.

This fella,
sometime in the middle
of the night,

goes berserk,
trashes this room,

and leaves
poor Shirley dead
right there.

If you ask me,
you ought to thank
your lucky stars

that you'â€™re still
in one piece.

As far as
your sister'â€™s
concerned...

I checked
the motel register.

There were no single women

staying in the motel
last night.

So I called your mom.

She told me about
some car trouble

that your sister
apparently had

and apparently
spoke to you about.

Is that true?

Yes, sir.

Alice,
I know about you.

I know about
the juvenile hall.

And I know about
the psychiatric stuff.

And I know
about the drugs.

I don'â€™t do drugs.
I'â€™ve never done drugs.

Not since your
junkie fellow died.

Junkie fella?

He was no drug addict.

He never even did drugs.
That was his first time.

And his name was John!

And he was all the colors
that you have never seen!

He was pink and white,
and he was my love!


And the child
that you'â€™re carrying
inside your body

is his, isn'â€™t it?

Look.

What'â€™s mine
is mine.

Frank.

Phone.

They found Santini.

Right
where she said.

And, uh,
Doc wants to know
if you'â€™re done yet.

Alice.

You gotta
take care of yourself.

You don'â€™t always
get a second chance.

All right, doctor.

All yours.

Come on, Alice.

Let'â€™s go before
the good sheriff

changes his mind, eh?

You really are
a psychologist.

Psychiatrist.

Psychiatrist?


So they
believed that?

They swallowed
the whole thing

about me being
a psycho?

Hey, I just told them
that, uh, you were
a patient of mine

who slipped
from medication.

They had
an open-and-shut case

against the Santini
thing

until you got
hysterical with them.

They naturally
resented it,

and I just gave them
a rational alternative
to paperwork.

God. You know,
somebody dies, and--

and somebody else
just fills out a form.


Maybe if the world
ran out of ink,

we'â€™d all live
forever, huh?


God, I thought
Sandra was--

I th-- I-- [sigh]

I-- I really thought
she was dead.

She is.

I'â€™ve got her
in the trunk of my car.

No, no, no.

Alice, it was just a joke
to relieve the tension.


A joke.

You know...


Maybe I should, um...

go my own way.

I hope you don'â€™t have
a problem with that.

You know...

I'â€™ve never met a woman
like you, Alice.

Never. Ever.

No, I don'â€™t have
a problem with that.

For luck?

Rats.

[door-open
warning bell]

I'â€™m sorry.

Forgive me?


[starts motor]

Thomas. Thomas.
Thom---

It'â€™s just
not here, Frank.

Well...

I tell you, humor me.

You know, I miss a lot
of stuff all the time.

Do you remember...

who you let 7
to last night?

7. Let'â€™s see now.

It was a young woman,
I believe.

Yes, that'â€™s right.
She was looking
for her sister.

Her sister, huh?

Did she look
anything like that?

Oh, yeah.

She was more
of a lady, though.

Lipstick and stuff.

She left
her room perfect.

Mmhh.

Did you see the person
she was with?

Only the car.

It was, like,
a black sports thing.

Mm-hmm.
Can I see the room?

Sure.

[flushes toilet]

[loud gurgling]

Here'â€™s the profile
on Nyman.

Sammy, I'â€™m really
sorry about Shirley.

If you want to talk...

you know...

Anything new,
Sammy?

Doc Muller
just phoned.

Says that
Shirley wasn'â€™t
murdered.

What?

Seems she died
of a heroin
overdose.

What about Nyman?

Jake Gordon Nyman.

Uh, Los Angeles
part-time employee.

The Los Angeles
Criminal Psychiatric
Department.

One of those
big-city shrinks

with a dozen-
and-a-half titles.Jesus Christ.

This is six months old.
Get me an update.

Call ahead to Bernie'â€™s.
Let'â€™s see if we can stop Nyman

from crossing
the state line.
Let'â€™s go.

Wait. Wait. Wait.
He'â€™s-- He's legit.
He'â€™s no psycho.

Well, that'â€™s good.
Maybe you can explain

what this was doing
in the crapper
of his motel room.

What is it?That'â€™s
a human tongue.

Oh, wow.

This is amazing.

[metal clinking]

[tool clinking]


Hey. Hi.

You folks
coming or going?

Coming or going?

State line.
You coming in
or going out?

Going out.

Gonna go
visit my mom.

Oh. How is
the little
lady?

She'â€™s old.

She'â€™s beautiful,
though.

Tired.

Tired, huh? Well,
maybe she could use

a little snake oil.

Snake oil?

Mm-hmm.

What does that do?

Just about anything
you want it to.

But, uh, mostly
just gives you
a nice buzz.

[phone rings]My wife
loves the stuff.

Blows her skirt
right up.


But...

100 and some proof,
you can'â€™t really
call it...

snake oil.
It-- you know.

Bernie.
Got a phone call.

Mmhh.Sheriff Noonan.

Sheriff Noonan.
Well...

Heh. You might
not know it
to look at me,

but I'â€™m a pretty
important person
around these parts here.

You-- Junior. Junior'â€™ll
take care of you.

Yeah, Frank?

Mm-hmm.

Yeah?

Uh, yeah,
dinner sounds great.


Can I help you
find something?

I need...a shovel.

Sure.

I'â€™ll be over
for dinner later,
Frank. Yeah.

That sounds good.
Bye-bye.

Ha ha! You folks
been taken care of?

Needs a shovel, Bern.

Well, we
got all kinds.
We-- We got--

We got all kinds
back there. You just--

All-- All depends
on what you need it for,

not that that'â€™s
any of my business.

I want it to...
dig a hole.

Hey, Jake!

So what do you think?

Very nice.

Aw, you'â€™re
just sayin'â€™ that.

I got a list
of them.

I-- I got a list
of...the kinds
we got.

Uh, inventory'â€™s
in the back, Bern.

No.
I got it... here.
I got a list--

Did it last night,
Bern.

It'â€™s in the back.[chuckles]

Don'â€™t-- Don't
ever own a store.

Your brain goes to hell
in a shit bucket.

[cocks trigger]
What'â€™s this?

What'â€™s this? What were
you gonna do with this?

I wasn'â€™t doing nothing.What were you
gonna do with this?

Come on out.
You, too. Out here.I wasn'â€™t doing nothing.

Swear to God.

Where you going,
Junior?

Come on back in here.
Join the party.

Please, Mister.
Please don'â€™t shoot me.

Please don'â€™t shoot--

Shut up when
I'â€™m tryin' to think!

Alice.

Go outside and bring
the car around.

Shut up!

Jake,
what'â€™s going on?Alice!

Go outside and
bring the car around!

Look what you'â€™re
doing to yourself.


Got a 10-20
for Sheriff Noonan.

Are you hearing me,
Frank? Over.

Hello, Freddie.
What'â€™s going on?

Well, we got
that update

on the Nyman fella.

He'â€™s wanted
for murder

of Professor
Max Tinder,

AKA the "Hitchhike
Killer." Over.

He killed that man?

That'â€™s a big
affirmative, Frank.

Nyman was
his shrink. Over.

There'â€™s a lot
of crazy people.

Frank, this guy'â€™s
a real nut case.

Now, Sammy,
don'â€™t let Frank do
anything crazy.

Are you feeling
all right, Frank? Over.

Never better.

Too much oxygen
in the blood is no good.

They'â€™ve done
studies, you know. [static]

[tires screeching]

I don'â€™t know, Frank.
I got a bad feeling
about this.

You got
a bad feeling
about everything.

You gotta admit, we have
never run into anything
like this before.

Oh, I ain'â€™t got
time for this.

Go around
the back.

Why?
You going in alone?

I'â€™m going in alone.

Well,
you sure that'â€™s
a good idea, Frank?

Oh, man, go! Just go.
Do what you'â€™re told.

All right.
All right.[click]

[breathing heavily]


[floor creaks]

[floor creaks]

[hinges creaking][cocks trigger]

Mmm!
Frank!

[muffled cry]

Frank!
Hey!


Frank!

Get us down!

You stupid
son of a bitch!

[Junior sobs]

What the hell
is going on here?!

God damn.
Get us down,
Frank.

What'â€™d you think I was
gonna do, kill 'â€™em?

I don'â€™t think so.
I'â€™d make a pretty bad
murderer.

But he pulled
a gun on us.
Jesus Christ.

You got any more
of those candy bars left?


Want to talk
to me, Jake?

I'â€™m a real good
listener.

Last week, I helped
a patient of mine

out of a situation...

he didn'â€™t belong in,
that'â€™s all.

But, I mean, you know,
it was killing him.

Of course you know.
You'â€™ve been there,
right?

I could'â€™ve told you
about it, but...

I don'â€™t know, I thought
maybe it'â€™d blow over, and...

Well, what
would you have done?

Oh, Jesus, I was never
so scared in my life.

You know, the adrenaline
went through me,
and I had the gun.

The next thing you know,
I'â€™m...

Here, take this thing.
I hate these things. Here.

No. Get it--

Just...put it away.

[puts gun down]

Go on.
Get outta here.

[exhales sharply]

Oh, Alice.

still friends?

Yeah.

We'â€™re still friends,
Jake.

You know, you'â€™ve got
a really good heart.

And, uh...you did
the right thing,
I think.

That guy
pissed his pants.

Ohh!

Did you see that?

I was pissin'â€™
myself, almost.
I almost--

I almost did.
Oh, God.

My pulse was just--
It was up here.

How you doing?
You all right?

Never better.

I wouldn'â€™t tell you
if I weren'â€™t, anyway.

You know what I feel
like now, Alice?

No. What do you
feel like now, Jake?

Aw, this
sounds stupid.

No. What?

I feel like
I could die now.
Right now.

Just...float away
into the sunset.

Become one of those...

sighs you hear whispering
through the trees at night.

You know...

Be happy.

â™ªâ™ª [woman chants]

Like, when I was a kid,

my father used to
hold me in his arms

and tell me how much
he loved me...

tell me
stories about...

hunting bears and...

long fishing trips.

I'â€™ll never forget him.

Where is she,
Jake?

I said where'â€™s
my fucking sister?

[turns off motor]

You answer me
right this second.

We'â€™ll need
the shovel.

Oh, you cocksucker!

You killed her,
didn'â€™t you?

No, I didn'â€™t.

I never killed
your sister.

Never, ever, and
that'â€™s the truth.

So where is she?

We'â€™ll need
the shovel.

your fucking shovel.

[gets keys]

Don'â€™t you move,
you piece of shit.

See...she died
when that Santini
guy hit us.

You know,
opened her head.
Look at that.

Right up. Sorry.

I heard her
knocking.

I heard her knocking.

I heard her knocking
just before it happened.

Yeah, well...

I feel real bad
about that,
but, uh, you know,

I thought I killed her.

Unhh, I told you, I'â€™d
make a terrible murderer.

I heard her
knocking for help.

She was still alive.

Well, we had
this deal, you see.

Heads, she came
with me, and...tails--

Unhh...

What the hell
are you doing?

What do you mean,
what am I doing?

This is the Utah
state line, Frank.

We are in pursuit
of a murderer.

But, Frank, we gotta
let Utah take care of this.

We gotta call it in.

By the time Utah
takes care of this,

they will find
that little girl'â€™s body!

Now, start this car!Frank, Frank,

there are procedures.
We'â€™ve gotta call
the Utah State Police.

We'â€™ve gotta tell them
that there'â€™s a murderer
on the loose.

We can'â€™t do this.
This is not--What procedures?

What, are you bucking
to be sheriff?
I'â€™m not dead yet!

You'â€™re not even
a goddamn deputy!

You have to wait
till I die!

What kind of
bullshit is this?
Get outta the car.

I'â€™ll drive it.
I'â€™ll leave you here.
God damn you!

Shit.

Get back
in that car!

I will leave you
out here, God damn you!

We are in pursuit
of a murderer!


Shit.


[breathing heavily]

Fuck.

Come on, Alice.

Alice,
I have your shirt.

It'â€™s gonna get
cold later. Come on.

[loud rattling]

[singsong voice]
Let me come in

by the hair of your
chinny-chin chin.

Alice.

Alice.

Alice, come on.

â™ª There was a little girl,
and her name was Alice â™ª

â™ª She was in the barn

But she'â€™s gonna
come out pretty soon.
I promise you that.

Come on, Alice!

Thought you
were my friend.

You gotta help me.

Friends don'â€™t
hurt each other!

Remember?

What choice
do I have, Alice?

What choice?

You can walk away!

Just walk away, and
I'â€™ll never say a thing!

Nobody will ever
know, I swear!

You really
mean that?

Of course I mean it!

I'â€™m the one
who killed her!
Remember?

Yeah.

Tell you what.

I'â€™ll flip you
for it.

No!

You will never,
ever have us!

Never!

[cracking, crashing]

[splintered pieces
falling]

Okay, Alice,
have it your way.

Come on, Alice.

Ohh...Br'â€™er Bear.

â™ª Please don'â€™t throw me
in the briar patch â™ª

â™ª Br'â€™er Bear â™ª

â™ª Please don'â€™t
throw me â™ª

â™ª In the briar patch

Where are you, Alice,
you bad girl?

All right.
Come on, Alice,

love me or leave me,
but this is horse shit.

You'â€™re gonna leave me
no choice, Alice.

All right.

Guess what I got.

Look whose lighter
I have.

And you know
what we do
with a lighter?

Alice?

We burn the barn down.

Heads...

you walk away, Alice.

Heads, you walk away.

Tails...

I cook you.

Come on!

[coin clinks]


Alice.

No. Not right! [whack]

Aahh!

Ohh!


Shoot.[digging]

And fuck![digging]

Shit. Fuck.

Shit...and fuck.

Shit and fuck
and shit and fuck!

You know what I'â€™m
pissed off about,
don'â€™t you?

Don'â€™t you,
God damn it?

You know
what that was,
don'â€™t you?

It'â€™s the whole point!
How am I going to know
what to do?

God damn you.

Your sister knew
what the point was!

She knew what
the rules were!

And you know, too.

So I want to know,
what was it?

It'â€™s the whole point!

What was it?

What was it?

I told you.

I told you. I told you
it was heads.

I don'â€™t believe you.
I don'â€™t believe you!

You'â€™re such
a goddamn liar.

Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

You'â€™re so goddamn
selfish!

I need some help
around here!

I am trying
to help you, Jake.

I really am,
and I understand.

I do!


"Jake...she'â€™s
a little girl,

"and she'â€™s very nice,
and you'â€™re being
very mean to her.

"And she fell down,
and she hit her head,

and that'â€™s why
she can'â€™t remember."

I know that!
I'â€™m so sorry.
Jesus.

You should be
a better guide.

I'â€™m really not
that bad a guy.

I'â€™m really quite
a good guy.

But, oh, fuck it.
You know,
what the hell?

I can'â€™t--
I can'â€™t do this.

There'â€™s only one time.
You can only do it once.

And if you do it
more than once,
then, you know,

you fuck everything up!

And I don'â€™t know!

Gaahh!

Well, I'â€™ve got an idea.

What kind of an idea
have you got?

Well, let me do it.

Do what?

Gimme the coin.

We'â€™ll start off
fresh and new...

just like cold,
clear running water.

Would you do that
for me?

Just this once.


Alice, I knew you were
a special human being.

Ohh...

Oh, boy.

I won'â€™t run.

No, because then I'â€™d
have to come after you,

and...
Of course.

I would.

I know.

I'â€™m gonna
just untie you.

I think this
is awfully tight,
and I'â€™m very...

sorry. You know.

But this will be better.
That'â€™s it.

Better now?
It'â€™s okay.

Give me the coin.

Oh. The coin.

Okay.

Heads...I walk away

and we never
see each other again.

Don'â€™t say it
that way.

I didn'â€™t mean it
to sound bad.

I-- You know,
go our separate ways.

Okay.

And tails?

Tails.

I'â€™ll use a rock.
Here. This one.

A really
nice-lookin'â€™ rock.

No. This one
right here.

You know, I'â€™m sorry about
what happened earlier.

I didn'â€™t mean
to hurt you.

And what I'â€™ll do
is I'â€™ll just...

I'â€™ll do it really fast.

There will be no pain.
I'â€™ll just--

It'â€™ll be like
going to sleep.

Okay, just...
It'â€™s right here...

where I can
see it.

Be just like
going to sleep.

Just like
going to sleep.

There'â€™ll be no pain.

Mm-mmm.

Look what you did!
Ohh!

See what happens
when you'â€™re a good girl?

[slaps thighs]
It was touch and go

there for a minute,
wasn'â€™t it?

Can you get this?

Yes. Of course.

Of course I can.

Of course I can.

Okay.

I was so...

proud of you.

Can-- My feet?
Yeah.

And your sister...

Oh, she would'â€™ve been
real proud of you, too.

Oh, gee.

Oh, Alice.

God.

Did I tell you
how much I loved
your eyes?

See you.


[departing footsteps]


[hinges squeaking]

[barn door closes]

[door-open
warning bell]

Alice.

Did you happen
to pick up my coin?

Thought I'â€™d keep it
as a souvenir.

[bell dinging]

It'â€™s my last one.
You know?

Here. Catch.


Alice, did you
ever see this?

[slapping a percussion
beat pattern]

[makes popping sound]
Ohh!

[door closes,
motor starts]

[car drives off]

Oh, Alice.

[glass shattering]

[steam hissing]

[soft heartbeats]

Oh, God...

[heartbeats continue]

â™ª I'â€™m puttin' in a call â™ª

â™ª To John and Paul

â™ª From a padded room
in the pan and zoom â™ª

â™ª Of this desperate town

â™ª 'â€™Cause they have
what I need â™ª

â™ª In the long slow bleed

â™ª That is suckin'â€™ the life â™ª

â™ª From my child and my wife

â™ª In this desperate town

â™ª And the telephone is king

â™ª Of the whole
damn thing, and â™ª

â™ª Each word
that is spoken â™ª

â™ª Is just another
promise broken â™ª

â™ª And each call
is just more dope â™ª

â™ª For all the junkies
who live on hope, and â™ª

â™ª I'â€™m lord
of the waitin'â€™ clowns â™ª

â™ª In this desperate town

â™ª Down in L.A. basin

â™ª Here with all
the riots racin'â€™ â™ª

â™ª I can'â€™t seem to shake
the throb and the ache â™ª

â™ª Of this desperate town

â™ª I can'â€™t sort
the fact from fiction â™ª

â™ª In this insane addiction

â™ª And all around the streets
is friction â™ª

â™ª And no one even
understands my diction â™ª

â™ª In this desperate town

â™ª And the telephone is king

â™ª Of the whole
damn thing, and â™ª

â™ª Each word that is spoken

â™ª Is just another
promise broken â™ª

â™ª And each call
is just more dope â™ª

â™ª For all the junkies
who live on hope, and â™ª

â™ª I'â€™m lord
of the waitin'â€™ clowns â™ª

â™ª In this desperate town

â™ª And the telephone is king

â™ª Of the whole
damn thing, and â™ª

â™ª Each word
that is spoken â™ª

â™ª Is just another
promise broken â™ª

â™ª And each call
is just more dope â™ª

â™ª For all the junkies
who live on hope, and â™ª

â™ª I'â€™m lord
of the waitin'â€™ clowns â™ª

â™ª In this desperate town

â™ª In this desperate town

â™ª In this desperate town
