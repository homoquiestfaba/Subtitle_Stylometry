<i>Cell block B to the mess hall.</i>

Jesus Christ.

I wore that in here?

No wonder they threw
the book at me.

Rules, honey.
You wear it in, you wear it out.

What's wrong with it?

Un-fuckin'-believable.

One, two, one, two!

Okay, ladies.
Shut up.

Settle down.
Shut up!

Shut up!

Knock it oft!
<i>Good-bye, Gloria</i>

<i>We hate to see you go</i>

Knock it oft!

Greenley, over here.

You got a date?
Yeah, but he stood me up.

Release form. Sign it.

You've been drawing on
the thousand dollars you came in with.

Which leaves you with 68.50,
plus your $100 release gratuity.

Gives you a total of 168.50.

Report to your parole officer Monday.
Don't get lost. Stay out of trouble.

You're not to leave Florida.
You violate this condition...

a warrant will be issued
for your arrest immediately.

You'll be right back here
where the sun don't shine.

Here, I just quit.

It's a Cartier, for real.
Take it. Go on.

Thanks.

Take what you want,
toss the rest.

<i>Welcome to Miami International Airport
baggage claim and ground transportation.</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin
boarding on Continental flight 251...</i>

<i>with service
to New York LaGuardia.</i>

You know what kind of bird
that is?

Dove.

It's a blue diamond dove.

Really?
Yep.

It's a fuckin' blue diamond dove.
Look at the blue feathers.

It's beautiful, huh?

You know, there's only 300
of those guys left in the United States.

If it shits on this car,
there's only gonna be 299.

That's her.

Hold the door!

What's up with you, lady?

Jack!

Anything happen?
What the hell's the matter with you?

You don't make me wait
in the hallway like that.

Did you go to the bank?
Did you get the money?

Yeah, yeah.
Did you get the tickets?

Yeah. There's a man in the lobby.
What kind of a man?

I don't know what kind of a man.
What did he look like?

Where are the kids?
They're in the kitchen.

Mommy, are the kids' bags packed?
Mommy, Nicky's wheezing.

I'm not wheezing, damn it!

Go get your inhaler.

You're not taking my grandchildren.
Mind your own fucking business!

Do not swear at my mother!
I'm staying here with Grandma.

It's gonna be all right.
Mommy, take them inside.

Where are we going?
It's gonna be all right.

Let's get you breakfast.
They don't know anything.

They don't know what we're doing,
where we're going.

Just a stupid remark?

You're gonna check the disk
when you get home?

You tipped them off.
I wanted a goddamn raise, Angie.

I said something about the disk.
So?

Now he knows you've been
copying it all down, right?

Every move they made,
all the details, everything.

Who told you copy shit down?
I did it for us, Angie.

I did it so we had something
to fall back on.

They don't know about the money, so?

Do they know about the money?

I don't know.

They're gonna...

Now they're gonna kill us.

Nobody's gonna get killed, okay?
All we gotta do... Listen to me.

All we gotta do
is get out of this city.

Mama, pack the bags!

You lousy piece of dirt.

How could you do this
to your family?

These kids are not leaving.

If you got yourself into trouble,
that's your tough luck.

These kids are not involved.
They know about the kids.

You cannot keep them.
They will come here and take them.

You get it?

Here, take this.
No!

I'm calling the police.
Are you out of your mind? No!

Damn it! This is your fault!
You got us into this!

Shut up! Quiet! Goddamn it!

Okay, we are leaving now.
I'm not going!

I'm not playing around.

I don't want to!
I don't want to go!

Is somebody coming to get us?

Come here.

Listen to me.

Take this disk.
It will save your life.

It's your bible. It's everything
I know about everything, okay?

You go.

Okay? Go down the tire escape
the way you did when you ran away.

Remember?
You listening to me?

Go find Uncle Manny,
over the bodega.

You know the bodega?
Yeah, I understand the bodega.

Find Uncle Manny, give him this disk.
He'll know exactly what to do with it.

Don't answer the door, Angie!
Listen to me, okay?

You be a man...

and you be tough, okay?

Always be tough
and trust nobody.

No broads, no friends.

Angie, don't answer that door!

You make your own way in this world,
and you call your own shots, okay?

Now you go.
You got your inhaler?

I got it. It's right here.

No, just go.
You're the man now.

You're the head of the family now.
You understand me?

I understand.
I'm the head of the family.

Yeah, you are. Yeah.

I love you.
I know.

Come on. You go.

Remember, you're the man.

I know. I'm the man.

Go!

You gotta pull the slide back first.

Too late.

Drop it.

Kick it over here.

<i>Get away from her.</i>

Over there.

No, no!
Move. Come on. Now.

<i>Old lady, over there.
Move. Come on.</i>

Where is it?

Where's what?

Where's the fucking disk?

I don't know what you're
talking about, Sean.

<i>Give me the disk.</i>

I don't have it, man.

I swear I don't have it.
It's not here.

Don't.

Let me call a doctor.

Where's the disk, Jack?

Give me the disk.

I don't have it.

Mommy?

<i>Papi,</i> please.

Someone!

Hey, kid.

Like you are some fashion plate?

You didn't have to
turn it into a bloodbath.

He pulled a gun on me.
He's a lousy little accountant.

This guy, his name is Jesus.
Thanks, Ian.

Jesus. But he wanted everybody
to call him Jack.

That should tell you
what kind of a guy he is.

You say "boo" to him,
he’d tall over and wet his pants.

He's as harmless
as cherry-fuckin' -pie.

Now I'm stuck with a kid.

The kid saw us.
You shouldn't have brought him here!

I do not want to kill again.

Goddamn it. What am I gonna do
with a goddamn kid?

I know what I’d do.

Get the hell out of my sight.

Fuckin' loser.

We better pray to God
he didn't make any copies.

What the hell happened, Raymond?

He got greedy.

Terry, what's wrong
with the goddamn kid?

I don't know.
He's got asthma or something.

Make him stop.
It's getting on my nerves.

Kid, let's go.

It's empty.
Be quiet.

Where's my dad? You said my dad
was gonna pick me up.

Shut up.

TV time.
I'm worried about my sister.

I think I should go home now.

Kid, don't worry about your family.
Start worrying about yourself.

Zach, ya son of a bitch.
Gloria!

How the hell are ya?
Jesus.

It's been a long time.
Three years.

You look great.
Yeah?

You let me up?
Oh, yeah.

It's good to see you.
You too.

Tell Kevin
Gloria's on her way up.

Kevin, Gloria's here.

What do you mean, "here"?

Not here in the building?

She's on her way up.

You look gorgeous.

I thought you weren't getting out until
next week. I would have picked you up.

I wanted to surprise you.
Surprise.

I've missed you so much.
Yeah.

You look great, Gloria.

Raymond.

Gloria, how are ya?
Just swell, Mick.

Terry.
Gloria.

Sean.
Nice to see you.

Ian.

Where's my stuff?

Did a little remodeling.

What about my cats?

I thought your sister took them.

I gotta change.
Look like a drag queen.

Great to see you.

You never came to see me,
not ever, not once.

I really wanted to.
Never ever, not once.

In three goddamn years,
you never came to see me.

What stood in your way?
I couldn't.

Really? Why not?
Ruby always needs me.

You know that.
Who the fuck needs Ruby?

I'm sick of these people.
When does it get down to being me?

I've been working 20 hours a day.
I went to the slammer for you.

You never showed up. Fine!
What was I supposed to do?

I want my money and I want out.
Walk in and announce myself?

Give me my money. I want out.
You don't have to worry about money.

I'm gonna take care of you.

I don't want you
taking care of me.

I've had three years of your
taking care of me. I've had it!

You got that?
Okay.

I know you're pissed off.

I'm not pissed oft.

You know me very well.

You know when I'm pissed off.
Do I look pissed off to you?

You wanna make love?

Do I wanna make love?
No, I do not wanna make love.

Maybe you’d like to change
the fucking sheets first.

Not now.
Sorry.

I said not now!
Sorry. It's Ruby on the phone.

He says it's important.

Well, it's Ruby.

I'll just be a minute.

Welcome back.
Thanks.

You got any good
lesbian prison stories?

You know, I got one word
for you, Terry: therapy.

I’d say group therapy,
but I like other people too much.

What's the matter with you?

Who the hell are you?

Watch your mouth, you wee fucker.

He has asthma.
Ran out of his medicine.

Asthma, huh?
Good-looking guy like you?

My dad was supposed to be here.

Yeah?

I'm worried about
my sister, lady.

Can you ask them about my dad?

Kid, shut your goddamn trap,
all right?

What's with the kid?

I had a situation
with his father.

I had some trouble.
Are you kidnapping kids now?

Just mind your own business.

This is my business.
This is my apartment.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Who the hell do you think
pays the goddamn bills?

Lucky me.

It must be fucking you.

Gloria, come on.
Excuse me.

What are you doing?

I'm still in love with you.

I've loved you my whole life.

I understand it's hard.
It's been three years.

There's distance.

Yeah.

It's not distance, you know?

It's...
What?

Shit.

Okay, you wanna talk.
Let's talk.

What do you wanna talk about?

Look, I took the rap for you.

I know.
Most people would have talked.

I didn't talk.

Look, we had a deal here.

You said there’d be money in a bank.
Where's the money? Where's the bank?

Kevin, I took the rap
for something I didn't do.

You owe me.

Here.
I don't want that.

I'm trying
to change my life here.

Jesus Christ! Talking to you
is like talking to a fuckin' brick wall.

You're right. We had a deal.

I owe you.

Please don't think I'm
not grateful, 'cause I am.

But there was more...

than just the deal
between us, right?

Listen, you...

you were wearing this dress
the night of your going-in party...

three years ago.

And I'm still wearin' it.
So what?

I've been thinking about that night
for three years.

Three fucking years.
Oh.

Thinking about that penthouse.

Do you remember me and you
that night?

Oh, honey.

You're no good.

You're just no damn good.

I know.

Come on.

Say you're my baby.

Say it.

I'm not gonna.

Say you're my baby.

Honey.

Say you're my baby.

Come here.
Let me go! No.

I want my money now.

We had a deal.
A deal?

Yes.
A deal?

The deal has changed, right?

You want your own apartment,
have your own apartment.

You want new clothes,
I'll buy you new clothes.

You want to get yourself a new cat,
go get yourself a new cat.

Whatever you want.

When do you report for parole?
Monday.

You're back here Tuesday through the
weekend till you report back next week.

Then you're back here again.
That's it. That's the deal. That's done.

I'm not gonna take
your bullshit anymore.

It's over.
No, it's not.

Will you stop saying that?
It's over! It's over!

It is over!
Stop it!

I always knew you were a bastard.

Fuck!

You never shot a short guy before?
What's the big deal?

Short, tall, tat, skinny.

They're all grown up.
You're talking about killing a kid.

This is the father.
This is the son.

The only difference is three feet.
I'll do it.

Kevin's not gonna like it.

I don't give a shit whether Kevin
likes it. It's gotta be done.

It's my ass. I was the one
who was up there.

Did the kid see you?
I don't know.

I don't like
to leave loose ends.

All right, Mickey, it's your turn.
I didn't leave you much.

You sure didn't leave me much.

Kid.

Did you forget something?

I just thought, you know,
Kevin might be in here.

Kevin's in his office.

Terry, you wouldn't hurt
a little kid, would ya?

You better get out of here.

Kid, come on.
Come over here.

He's watching his show.

What's your favorite cartoon, kid?

Mine's " Top Cat. " He's cool.
Come over here right now.

Calm the fuck down.

What are you fucking doing?
What's your fucking problem?

You gonna calm the fuck down?

Yeah.

I just lost my head.

You're gonna walk right out of here?
Yeah, I lost my head.

You're right.
It's none of my fuckin' business.

All right.

Kid, come here.

Come on!

Right now! Come on!

Kevin.
Get out there.

All right, get up.

Go on.

Great. Everybody, guns down.
Put 'em on the ground right now.

Kick 'em forward.
You, go over there.

Jesus, Kevin, what are you doing,
killin' kids now?

Gloria, put the gun down.
Nobody's killing anybody.

Get up there.

What's the matter with you?

Get up there. Go on.

You too, Raymond.

Get up the stairs right now,
or I'll shoot him, I swear to God.

You, get up there.
Get up!

All right, kid.

Go get my bag.

All right,
you all just get back.

All right, kid.
Come here. Open the bag.

Have you lost your mind?

Yeah, I have. Now I lost it twice.
How about that?

Now, just...

empty your pockets.

Put your money on the table
right now.

I am not fuckin' around here!

You're making
a big fuckin' mistake.

You know what, Kevin?
You're my big fuckin' mistake.

I went through shit you wouldn't
even want to fuckin' dream about.

And for what?

For some two-bit, cheap,
fuckin' asshole, that's what.

Jewelry too.

This is my grandfather's watch.
Great.

I'll never forget this.
Come here, kid.

Now, all of you, back up.
Back up.

Back up.
All right, come here.

I want you to hop up here.
That's good.

Just put all that jewelry
in your hat.

If you make a move towards this kid,
I'm blowing your brains out.

You got that?

Hurry it up, kid.

Get back, Terry.
All right, kid.

Get down here. You put that
in the bag and stay behind me.

You'll be sorry for this,
I promise you.

You will be sorry, Kevin,
if you even think of coming after me.

Statute of limitations
is seven years.

Don't make me turn
state's evidence against you.

All right now.

I want all of you
to take oft your clothes.

Come on!
I mean it. Take oft your clothes now.

I haven't seen a naked man
in three years. Fuck you!

So give me a show.

Come on.

Why are you folding up your clothes?
This is a stickup.

I'm sorry.
Throw 'em up forward, right now.

All right. Come here, kid.

Gather these up, all right?

Not the glass.
Be careful of the glass.

Underwear too. Underwear too.

Come on, you big bunch of studs.
Underwear too. Right now.

Throw it up here.

Big bunch of studs.
Yeah, yeah.

Wait a minute.

I want you to throw them out
the window over there, all right?

All right. Watch the bag.

Right down there.
I know where.

To your left.

You got it. Go on.

Raymond, who knew?

Now, don't any of you guys move.

Kid, throw everything out the window.
Just chuck it right out the window.

Don't you move.

Shoes too. Get everything.

What the fuck...
This is fuckin' shit.

All right, come on. Let's go.

Where are you going?
I'll be right back.

Come on!

Do not leave here
with that disk, Gloria.

I'm not fuckin' around.

I will kill you.

I bet you would.

Fuck you for thinking you
ever owned me or still do.

Kid, run.
Open the door right there.

Thanks for taking care
of my cats, prick!

Go, go!

Kid, when you get to the street,
I want you to run like hell.

What was going on up there?

Playing strip poker.

Take off.

Those guys weren't kidding around.
They were really gonna hurt you.

I can take care of myself.
Yeah, right.

Where do you live?
158th Street.

All right.
See the subway over there?

I want you to run
and go get on the subway.

I don't know how.
You don't know how what?

To get on the subway.
You just...

You just get on the subway and
get off at 158th Street, all right?

I can't by myself.
I'll get lost.

You can do it, honey.
Just get off at 158th, okay?

I can't.
Sure, you can.

I can't by myself.
Jesus Christ.

All right, come on.

Ruby.

You took time oft
from your busy schedule.

Sorry I'm late. How's things?

I'm still losin'

The ponies,
they're unpredictable.

That's why I play 'em.

You know me. I always win eventually,
one way or the other.

But enough of this social chatter.

I want to see your lips move.

I want to see the words
come out of your mouth...

so I can find out
if I believe 'em.

Everything's fine.

The only thing that's tine
is the way you lie.

I respect that, sort of.
You know, Kevin.

You're one of these fellas
who read all the right books...

and turned out all wrong.

You were that way
when I first met you.

You was like that
when you was a kid.

So, which is it?

Are you a fuckup or a thief?

What are you saying, Ruby?

You told me you had the kid
and the disk.

I don't.

But it's just a temporary setback,
like I said.

Everything's tine.

You know, Kevin...

I've been in prison tour times.

I don't want to
make it a handful.

Do I have to remind you
what's on that disk?

Names of cops, sergeants...

lieutenants, captains.

Everyone we had on the pad.

Dates, numbered accounts,
judges...

a congressman or two.

Couriers.

It's me whole fuckin' life’s work.

Now, you got yourself
into trouble.

I expect you to work your way out.
What can I say? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

It's all gonna be straightened out
today, I promise you.

Now, if you get
into more trouble...

I don't know you
and I never did...

because it any of this
comes back to me...

I'll kill ya.

I promise.

That won't be necessary, Ruby.

Raymond, we got work to do.

What the hell is this?

This your block, kid?
Yeah.

Excuse me.
Excuse me. Let us through.

You let her through
and not me?

Go on. Go home. Go on.

Go home. Go.

Go ahead.

Hey, move.

Hey, lady.

What?
They won't let anybody in.

So go back and wait a little bit.
Find your friends.

I'm hungry.
All right, stay back.

Come on.

Give me a slice.
Pepperoni.

Pepperoni. Go sit down.

So, kid, got any relatives?
What?

What's your name, kid?

Do you know your last name?
Nuñez.

Good. Nicky Nuñez.
Okay, good.

Got any grandparents?
My grandma lives with us.

Got any aunts or uncles?

Uncle Manny.

My father told me to go
to my Uncle Manny's.

Great. Uncle Manny.
There you go.

Where does Uncle Manny live?

Downtown.
Good. Where downtown?

Over a grocery store.
Okay.

Good.

This street that Uncle Manny
lives on... Hey!

This street
that Uncle Manny lives on...

When I'm talkin' to you...
You gotta help me out. You got that?

This street that he lives on,
does it start with an "A"?

Start with a " B," a " C"?

I don't know.
What the hell am I doing with you?

I didn't come here to hang out with you.
I gotta be back in Miami by Monday.

A coffee, black, no sugar.

Keep still.
It's me.

There's cops all over.
Fire trucks, newscasters.

Yeah, I'll just hang around
in case she shows up with the kid.

Thanks. Keep the change.

Where are we going?
I want to go home!

Listen, you gotta shut up.
You can't go home, all right?

We're in trouble here.
You gotta help me out.

We gotta help each other out,
understand?

I gotta get you somewhere.

What are you talking about?
I wanna go home!

Shut up, kid! You can't go home.
There's no one there anyway.

Your parents aren't there.
They...

They left, and they want me
to get you somewhere.

I'm gonna take you to your uncle's.
Now, stay there.

Shit. Sit still.

Fuck!

There's a lot of them here.

" C.M. Leon. "
Is Manny his middle name?

I don't know!

"Jennifer Leon"?
Sound familiar?

I don't know, lady.

Jesus Christ, kid!
What do you know?

Hello?
Hi. Is Manny there?

Yeah, this is Manny. Who's this?
Manny!

You got a nephew?

Yeah. Who is this?

Listen, Manny,
I got this kid here, Nicky Nuñez.

Is he your nephew?
Yeah. Who the hell is this?

It's a long story.

Look, I just got him here,
and I need to bring him to you.

So what's your address?

Yeah.

All right. Thank you.

All right, come on!

Stop fuckin' around.

Stop, stop.

Here, keep that.
Thank you very much.

All right. Come on, kid.

You're on your own here,
or what?

All right. Hey, excuse me!

Come down here.
You don't go without me.

You do not go without me.

I gotta go.

I'm the person from the phone...

Jesus Christ.

Where are we going?
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

Lady, are you crazy?
This is my Uncle Manny's house.

Where are we going?

Don't worry about it.
Screw you, lady!

I'm going home.

Jesus Christ, you stupid kid!
What are you doing?

You don't understand.
This is serious business.

I know these guys.
They're my friends.

Oh, yeah?
You got some pretty shitty friends!

Okay, you're a regular wiseass.
I gotta get you somewhere.

Would you stop dragging me?

I've been waiting in front
of that goddamn building for hours.

Ian, let me get a black coffee.

You and your fucking itchy fingers.

You're gonna get me buried.
All right already, Kevin.

He had a piece.
He had a fucking gun, okay?

Sean, if you were any dumber,
I’d have to water you.

Come here.

Cool it.
Cool it?

You want me to fucking cool it...

when the whole goddamn organization's
goin' down the fuckin' drain?

Your name's on that disk, Zach.

And Raymond's too.

And Mickey's and Terry's...

and this stupid
shithead's name too!

Everybody's name!

We could be wiped out...

for good!

So clean up this fuckin' mess.

I don't want no blood
stainin' my floor.

I want you to try to
keep quiet in here, all right?

My sister lives here.

She's not always
too happy to see me.

Jesus Christ.
What are you doing here?

I was just in the neighborhood.
I thought...

You gonna invite me in?

So where is everybody?

Jeffrey’s at work.
The kids are at school.

I thought you were in prison.

I just got out.

You could have called first.

Who's the kid?
A friend from prison.

Now, look, I want you
to sit down here.

Be good.
Don't touch nothing.

I mean it.

What are you doing
with someone's kid?

Baby-sittin'

So you off from work today?

I don't work.
I'm a housewife.

Well, hey, good for you.

I'm glad all your dreams
came true.

Look, Brenda...

I know I'm like the last person
you wanted to see today...

but I was wondering...

if maybe we could
just stay here for tonight.

Just the night.

I don't think so.

Jeffrey and the kids and...

everything.

Yeah.

I'm in trouble with Kevin.

When are you not in trouble?
Hello.

It's Kevin.

Been a long time.

Yeah. How are you, Kevin?

How've you been?
Pretty good. You, Brenda?

Okay.

Kids are growing, you know.

Well, no,
unfortunately I don't.

But now that Gloria's out,
maybe I can rectify that.

Oh? Gloria's out?

You didn't know?
No, I haven't seen her.

Well, if she calls or anything,
I’d love to know.

Sure.

You got my number, right?
No. Give it to me.

It's easy to remember.

555-6363.

I got it.

I hope you're not lying to me.

<i>Are you lying to me?</i>
No.

Of course not.

Why would I lie?

I think that old friends
should not lie to each other.

Of course.
Okay, take care, Kevin.

What'd you do now?

Look, thanks a lot.
All right?

But it he calls again...

you haven't seen me, okay?

Kevin killed...

Killed? Who?

Who killed who?
What are you talking about?

What the hell
are you talking about?

Wait. Never mind.
I don't want to know.

I don't want to know.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

You shouldn't have this kid with you.
Kids should not be exposed to you.

What am I, the mumps?
Let me get to the point.

I don't want my kids exposed to you.
Come on.

Let go of me!
Stop roughhousing that kid right now.

Let go of him.

I don't know how we came from the same
place, 'cause you are not my sister.

You come and put my family in danger?
I'm sorry. Not in my house.

I don't want this in my house.
Well, good for you.

You’d treat me better
it I was a stranger.

Sometimes I wish you were.
Done.

Get out of here!
I don't want you in the building.

Gosh, she's mean.
No kiddin'

She's ugly too.

Yeah?

Well, not everybody's as lucky
in the looks department as you and me.

She makes a hell of a meat loaf.

What about the kid?
He's under five.

No, I'm not. I'm seven.

Anybody got two quarters?

A ten spot for two quarters.
I got it.

Aren't you nice.
Any time.

You should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

What are you doing?

You all right?
I need a new inhaler.

This?

All right. Okay.

We'll get you one.
All right.

You got any more of these?
You got a prescription?

I lost it.

I can't do it without a prescription.
But he can't breathe.

I can breathe. I have asthma.
Shut up.

You're so rude.
Shut up or I let you choke.

Come on. The kid can't breathe.
Sorry. Not without a prescription.

Let me look for it again.

I found it.

I can't make out
the doctor's signature.

It's Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

The druggist in my neighborhood...

gives it to me
without a prescription.

That guy was just screwing you.

You think so?

Thanks a lot.

I can open it.

Where are we going?
Shopping.

Why?

'Cause you smell, and I'm tired
of looking at you in those clothes.

What am I going to do with you?
Don't worry about me.

Oh, yeah, don't worry about you.
That's right. You know what?

You're driving me crazy.
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

'Cause I'm running out of time,
money and patience.

Hey, where’d you get that toy?
You don't steal when you're with me.

What, are you nuts?
You trying to get us arrested here?

It's none of your business
what I do.

You don't listen, and worst of all, you
don't know when to admit you're wrong.

Don't tell me what to do.
It puts me down.

I'm the man.
I tell you what to do.

I don't fuckin' like how you talk.
You have a filthy mouth.

You listen to me, you little punk.
You're just a little kid. Act like it.

Jesus Christ, you're five years old.
I'm seven! I'm not a baby.

I'm a man. I'm the man.

You are not the man.
You are the boy.

You listen to me.
You go to school, men go to work.

You got no hair on your face,
men do.

You got a small pee-pee,
men got big pee-pees... some of them.

Hopefully,
one day you will too.

You are not the man.
You are a boy.

Here. You take this, put it away.
I don't wanna see it again.

Don't be a little thief.

Come on! Hey, this way.

Miss.
Do I look like a miss to you?

I got a kid with me here.
I need a room.

Sixty-five bucks a night.
You wash the sheets?

Every summer.

It's not so bad as it looks.

I've seen better.

True.

Possibly true.

You got pretty big feet
for a girl.

What, are you tryin'
to win me over?

Christ!
Kevin... what a chump.

All my pictures,
all my perfume...

my shoes.

Dresses.

I had a really nice coat.
So you could buy more.

Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm so rich.

Sure.
Sure, you're rich.

Yeah, I really blew it.

You know, women got
the greatest deal in the world.

All they gotta do
is fall in love...

and some guy just
takes care of 'em, you know?

Look at Brenda. She makes a so-so
meat loaf and ends up on Central Park.

I had chances, you know?

Some guys liked me.

Christ, I had more boyfriends
than I can remember.

Tall.

Some of them were tall.
Some of them were short and tat.

They were funny.
I don't need much.

Just give me a guy
who likes to win...

and I'm happy.

That's it.

Just some guy who likes to win.

It's enough, you know.

Threw my life away...

for nothin'

You would have really
liked my cat.

Excuse me. What the hell
do you think you're doin'

Where’d you get those?
Wise guy.

Hey, sometimes I smoke.
Sometimes you smoke?

You're six years old.
Smoke when you're ten.

And you've got asthma.
What, are you nuts?

Forget it.

Wham. Yeah.

<i>Quiet!</i>

It's Gloria.
Is he there?

Where are ya?

Kevin, I'm in trouble again.

I wanna know why.

This kid is drivin' me nuts, and I don't
know what I'm supposed to do with him.

Come on, Gloria.

<i>That kid means nothin' to you.
Come on.</i>

<i>A gangland killing

<i>Police say 35-year-old Jack Nuñez,

You stupid kid!

Hey, mister!

Mister, you gotta stop the train!
Hold up, lady!

Mister, stop the train!
Hold up!

Let go of me!
Calm down! Calm down!

Calm down!

Calm down! Calm down!

That's my kid!
That's my kid on the train!

You know where he's goin'
Tell me. Talk to me.

158th Street!
158th Street.

You crazy kid.
You scared me half to death.

What's the matter with you, huh?

Did it happen?

Are they dead?

Did everything really happen?

Yeah.
No!

I hate you.
That's okay.

You can hate me right now.

I want my mommy. I want my papi.
I want to go find them.

You know, Nicky...

you can't even believe how much
I understand how you feel.

'Cause my mom and dad...

Well, your mom and dad...
They love you.

And because they love you...

you can always talk to them...

you know,
just like they were there.

And they'll always
be there for ya.

You just...

You can't go find 'em, you know?

I know it's hard to understand.

Because...

Well, you'll understand one day.
You will.

When you grow up...

It's just hard right now,
because you're so little.

I'm seven. How many times
do I have to tell you that, lady?

I know.
And I'm the man. I say what to do.

I'm sorry. I know you are.

You're the man, all right?

Now, don't get
so upset about it. Just...

I wanna go home.

There's no one there, baby.

Why don't you try
and go to sleep now, all right?

Okay? You just try to...

You want me
to sing you a little song?

Huh?

Mommy?

Where's Jesse?

He died two years ago.
Who are you?

An old friend.
And who are you?

I'm his son, Freddie.

He was a good guy, your dad.
Yeah, yeah.

Look...

I got about 50,000 here.
I'll take five.

Oh, you will, will ya? Yeah, but
I got to look at this stuff first, okay?

Your father never
had to look at anything.

Yeah, well?

This used to be like
a home away from home to my jewelry.

Not to mention my furs.

Hello? I got a bus to catch here.
I don't have all day.

What? You got ten Rolexes here.
Come on. Let's go.

All right.

Thanks a lot.
Pleasure doin' business with ya.

Excuse me.
You sign for me.

Let me talk to Kevin.

Raymond, bring the phone book.

She's in Hell's Kitchen.
Check those tourist hotels.

And keep callin'. We're gettin' there.
We are gettin' there.

Kid? Kid, come on.

Come on. Get up.
Those guys are outside. Come here.

Look. Come here.

We gotta get dressed.
I gotta get you outta here, all right?

They wanna hurt us.
Give me your foot. Give me your foot.

You want me to hold
the disk for ya?

Disk, disk. Where's my disk?

I want my disk. Please.
Come on.

Nice to see you, Sean.
Fuck you, Gloria. This game is over.

Yeah?

This look familiar to you?

It should. It's yours.

It's got a silencer on it.

You remember how easy it kills,
ya bastard.

Go over there by the wall!

Get over there by the wall!

Get over there!

Get your hands out of your pockets
where I can see 'em.

Go on. Get back there.

I mean it.

Keep goin' Against the wall.

All right, kid.
Get in the car.

You're dead meat, Gloria.
Dead meat.

Dead meat.

Bitch!
Let go of me, ya fuck!

Ya bitch! Bitch!
What are you? Crazy?

Hold on!

Hold on!

Are you okay?

Yeah. I'm okay.

You looked scared.
I don't get scared. I get pissed oft!

Then why do you look scared?

Well, of course I'm scared! For
God's sake, give me a break here, right?

If you think I'm scared of those morons,
I'm not, all right?

I'm hungry.

Look at the crap
you've gotten me into.

What did I do?
Everything. Put your hat on.

I gotta pee.
Me too.

Okay. Come on.

Mommy?

I had a dream
about you last night.

I wish I can see you.
Can you see me?

Would you like me
to hear confession?

I'm not exactly...
All right.

It's been a long time
since I've done confession, Father.

So, no, thanks.

Father?

I... I'm sorry.

It's just that I've never been
too comfortable in those things.

It's still, like, confidential
if we do it out here, right?

Yes.

It's... You know, maybe
you could tell me what to do.

I got this kid.
He's not my kid.

I just kind of got involved with him.
His whole family's dead.

He's got nobody. You know,
so I got stuck with him.

It's that kid over there.

This is between us, right?

He's got these guys...
They want to kill him.

Now, I know these guys.
They used to be my friends.

So they let me walk away.
I mean, I could get away.

They won't do anything to me.
But this kid... He's drivin' me nuts.

I can't take care of him. I mean,
he's a good kid, but he's not my family.

I don't want him dead,
and I don't know what to do with him.

I gotta be back in Miami on Monday,
because I just got outta jail and...

Okay, okay, okay. All right.
Yeah?

Hold on. Start at the beginning.
Maybe I can do something for you.

Timmy, it looks like we got it.

Harry, Paul, Queen, 8-6-3.

That's H-P-Q-8-6-3.

Guinness. Thanks.

No, I'll take care of it.
Leave it to me.

Yeah?
Kevin, we got the car.

Where?

Thank you, Michael.
I owe ya.

128th and St. Nick's.

Come back in half an hour.
I might have something for you.

Okay. Get your hat.

Come on.

Thanks a lot.

I'm hungry.
No kiddin'

Coffee, black.
What do you want?

A Coke and chocolate cake.

For breakfast?
Yeah, a Coke and a cake. Are ya deaf?

You're so tough.
It's all an act, kid.

Do you like me?
Yeah, kid, I like you.

Do you love me?
I don't even know you.

Listen, I gotta talk to you like
you're a big guy now, all right?

Yeah.
Like you're all grown up.

You know the priest we just talked to?
Yeah.

He just told me about this school,
upstate, for boys.

Supposed to be real nice.
Lots of trees, animals.

You like animals?
I hate animals.

So you stay away from 'em.

You're getting rid of me.
You'll be sate there.

I'm not going to some stupid,
dumb school where I don't know anyone.

You don't understand, all right?

Now, we gotta get outta Manhattan
before they find us.

And I gotta get back to Miami
before they chuck me back in jail.

Which means what? That I gotta
find something to do with you.

You got that?

Christ! You're the only kid I ever met
who makes a big deal out of breathing.

The Coke is for him.

Is that what your brains tells you?

Listen, kid, I understand
your situation, all right?

And I wouldn't trade places with you
for all the tea in China.

But it is what it is,
and we gotta deal with it.

How can I make ya understand?

They're tryin' to kill us. We could
be dead by tonight. Eat your cake.

What?

Oh, come on. What's with
the snifflin' over there?

Would ya knock it oft, huh?
Would you knock it...

Would you stop your cryin'

Come on.

Everything I say is wrong, all right?
I don't have any kids.

I never even liked kids, all right?
I never liked kids.

Just shut up.
You talk too much.

Will ya listen to me, Nicky?

Life is a dream.
It only lasts a minute.

And there's lots of people,
lots of stupid people...

lots of jerky people,
lots of idiots.

I won't care it I die today,
but you... You're different.

You're a kid. You can't
even reach the urinal yet.

You got all kinds of things...

You got a lot
of lovemakin' to make.

You got a lot of booze to drink.

You got a lot of growin' up to do.

Look at ya. You're just a...

a teeny little
baby bug thing over there.

You know, I’d like to see you
in a tie one day or a tux.

You know, you could go gambling. You
could. You could hang out with the guys.

You could go to the racetrack.

Chase around some
skinny blonde girl, big boobs.

There's a lot of things
you could do yet.

I'm not going to the school.
I'm not.

What's the matter with you?
You demented or what?

I'm expressing a philosophy
to you here, all right?

I'm trying to tell you
what life is all about.

I'm trying to tell you that when you
grow up, you're gonna be a handsome guy.

You could have kids of your own. That's
what I'm tryin' to tell ya. Understand?

I don't wanna go to the racetrack.

So don't go
to the racetrack, all right?

Would you breathe some air into your
lungs over there? You're turnin' blue.

Huh?

Ask for Father Paul.
He's expecting you at 9:00.

Thanks. Come on.

Let's go.

Shit.

Jesus.

Wait, Nicky!
Come with me!

Come this way!

Hurry!

Hurry!

Help! Help! Help!

Terry, you bastard!
Move!

Oh, fuck.

Oh, God.

Oh, God, please.

Is Diane here?
Yeah. Diane!

Thanks, Diane!
Call us if you need us!

You guys, you wanna hurry up?
You gonna take all day?

Clean up this mess.
Let's go. I'm tired.

Thanks, Diane.
Bye, sweetheart.

Holy-ga-molys.

Come on in. What happened now?

Want some coffee?
Yeah.

Sit down.

Kevin's tryin' to kill me.

So why should today
be any different?

No, this time
he's really tryin' to kill me.

I need to see Ruby.

What do you want
to see that bastard for?

There's this kid.
A kid?

Yeah, a kid.
Kevin killed his entire family.

Now he wants to kill the kid.

I'm telling you, the first time
I even talk to a kid, I get involved.

Jesus Christ, this kid,
he's got nobody.

His whole family's dead.
Just breaks your heart.

Gloria, what are you thinking?

Kevin, these guys... They're your
friends. They're your family for life.

I think Ruby could help me out of this
situation here. Kevin listens to him.

Because he has to.

You know, Kevin's
the only person I never trusted.

But Ruby is always good
to the ones he likes...

and he always liked you, didn't he?

You know where I could find him?
It's Sunday.

Where the hell
do you think you can find him?

I gotta be in Miami tomorrow
to report for parole.

What the hell are you thinking?

Go to Miami. Get the hell
outta here and start your life.

My whole life...

Every time I should have made a right,
I made a left.

I fucked up.
I made bad decisions.

I don't know where it went.

I want to do the right thing.

You gotta think about the moments.
Just the moments.

Okay.
A bottle of wine...

a dinner party,
a boat ride, a ranch mink.

Something soft and furry.

These are the things
you gotta remember.

Those are the things I remember.

It's what keeps you sane.

You always had it together.

I got my business, okay?

That's what I got.
I got my girls. I got my guys.

That's my life, you know?

I'm seein' a guy.
He's a Jew, but he's a good guy.

I used to wanna be you.

I know.

You can't go see Ruby looking like that.
Let's get you dressed. Come on.

Nothin'
Yeah.

She's got it.
That selfish bitch.

She said she's not scared of you
and she'll blow your damn heads oft!

Kid, you're givin' me the biggest
fuckin' headache I ever had, so shut up.

What you want to do with him?

Throw him in the closet.
We're gonna need him.

Let me go! Get your hands off me!

Hey, I'm not goin' in there!
Get in the fuckin' closet.

Here's the keys.

I hope she starts.
She's a bit like me.

You gotta be real nice to her,
or else she ain't gonna turn over.

I love ya.

You're still the sexiest man alive.

People are lookin' for you.

I know.

Pick a horse.
You always was lucky.

All right.

Pick another.

This kid?
The boy doesn't know anything.

He knows you.

You know me.
I like to gamble.

But I don't gamble with people.

Gloria, things have changed.

We're not out there hijackin' trucks
anymore or shootin' Wops.

This is big business.
You're interfering' in very high stakes.

I didn't know you was
involved with this.

Shit, Ruby, I swear.
I swear to God.

I did not know you was
involved with this.

You have the disk?
Yeah.

It's somewhere sate.

You're gonna kill me?

What are you sayin'

I made love with ya.

I bought you things, jewels and...

We can't have somethin'
like this threaten us.

The boy doesn't know anything.

He's a...

He's a very smart
and ingenuous guy.

I could see him doin'
somethin' with his life.

I have 11 kids,
and I love 'em all.

I love their mothers too.
I understand this mother thing.

You're a woman.
He's a little boy.

You tall in love.
All women are mothers, right?

But you...

You're not a mother.

No, I'm not a mother.

I've always been a broad.

So how you gonna
take care of the kid?

I'll work. I'll get a job.
I can take care of him.

You never worked a day in your life.
I worked every day of my life.

What are you doin'

You're a smart girl.
You're actin' very stupid.

You got a lot of life left.

Why did you come here?

I don't trust Kevin.
I can't trust him.

I wanna make a deal with you.

I'll give you the disk.
You tell Kevin to give me the kid.

Look, I got this kid
in a school upstate, St. Lawrence.

He'll be gone.
I'll disappear.

You'll never hear
from either one of us again.

Call Kevin oft.

All right.

I'll talk to him.

It's your lucky day.

Ruby, I need you to be there
when I give him the disk.

You gotta be there.

You got it.

I never should have let you go.

Where's the disk?

The kid first.

The disk first.

It ya ever loved me...

if ya ever want to be the man
you used to be...

let him go.

Please?

Leave us alone.

Take the boy and go.

Come on, kid.

Okay?

Is it?

See ya later.

Now go on. Go to sleep.
We gotta get up early.

Good night, Mommy.
Good night, <i>Papi.</i>

Gloria?
Yeah?

Are you gonna come see me?

I'm gonna be far away.

Well, it you weren't tar away,
then would you come and see me?

Yeah, I think I would.

I’d like to think I would.

Nick, I’d like to
clear somethin' up.

It you wanted me to...

I could be your mother.

I mean, you know, you could
think of me like I was your mother.

You could it you want.
I don't have a mother, so you could.

I just wanted to clear things up.

You're my father. You're my mother.
You're my whole family.

You're my friend.
You're my girlfriend too.

Well, you know, I think
I could be your family. How's that?

Gloria?
Yeah?

Do you mind if I face you?

Whatever makes ya happy.

May I touch yours?
May you touch my what?

Your hair, silly.
I don't like people touchin' my hair.

You like me?
Who could resist you?

With a body like yours?
It's a pleasure lyin' in bed next to ya.

Gloria?
What?

Do you dream about me?
What are ya doin'

You tryin' to embarrass me? I outweigh
you by like what? Sixty pounds?

Give in? Maybe 100.

You're in for it now, mister.

Looks nice.

Looks really nice.

Do you see those boys there?

Yeah.

That must be one of their classes.
Must be.

<i>Those are the kind of boys
you should be friendly with.</i>

<i>Classy.</i>

Nicky?
Yes?

I'm Father Paul. Come with me.
Let me show you around.

Miss Greenley.

How are you?

You okay?

Please have a seat,
and I'll be with you in a moment.

So where ya gonna go?

Told ya a million times, kid,
I gotta be in Miami.

See? That's the problem with you.
You don't listen.

It's just the kind of stuff
we've been talkin' about.

I never been very good at sayin'
good-bye, so I'll see ya when I see ya.

Okay? Okay.

I just wanna say good-bye again.

Of course.
Okay?

Go ahead.
Thank you.

Ya like it here?
I hate it here.

You sure?
Positive.

Would ya like to leave?
Gloria, what are you doing?

I just... I think that it would
be better it you were with me.

I'd feel better.
Me too.

Okay.

Those...

Those guys are gone.

So I want you to walk real natural
and get in the car.

You know, I don't
have much to offer.

I don't even have an apartment.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with you.

Well, what about a motel?
We did good in a motel.

I like sleeping with you.

You're not the first guy
to tell me that.

I gotta tell you something. You know,
I don't know anything about children.

I never even liked children.

And I don't cook.

No big deal. Pizza.
We send out.

You know, you're a regular smart-ass.
You got an answer for everything.

I told you. I'm the man.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Continental flight 491...</i>

Okay, that's our flight.
That's us, right?

Yep. I'll take this.

All right.
Now, you may be the man...

but if you get out of line...

I'll have you on a plane
so fast your head will spin.

You got that?
I won't know what hit me?

You won't know what hit ya.
