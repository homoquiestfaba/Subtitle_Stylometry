Alright, I'm going to
spray some rosewater.

Okay, take a deep breath.

Take your time getting up.
Let's have some water okay?

Thank you.

Um, Abby? Will you marry me?

Ha ha.

The upstairs toilet
is acting funny.

What?

Upstairs toilet is acting funny.

Oh.

Have you noticed?

No, I guess I haven't
really noticed.

It was making a running
sound like even,

even when it wasn't, just
when it was not in use.

And then it would stop.

Okay, well did you
look in the back.

Like did you look in
the tank of the toilet?

Mm-mm.

Sometimes the chain just falls
off. And you just reattach it.

Is there, is there
anything that I, I can...

No, everything is
everything's under to control.

Okay then.

I'll get it.

Hey Paul Hey Good to see you.

Yeah, I beat my record, by like
two minutes. Oooo...Ah man.

Is everybody in the kitchen?

Are you out of your mind?

A calzone is not the
same as a hot pocket.

Ok, what's the difference then?

There's a huge difference.

Okay, what's the difference?

Ok, you've got your
tomato -based filling

and you've got your
pastry based outer shell.

Hold on, have you ever
even had a calzone?

I got a pizza and I flipped it
over and I called it calzone.

You know what we're going to do?
I'm going to make you a calzone.

Okay.

And you're going to eat it

and then I'm going
to prove you wrong

and you're gonna owe me.

Okay. Deal.

What do you owe me?

I don't know.
What's he gonna owe me?

What should I owe her?

I don't know.

How bout...How bout a beer.

Okay.

And if it turns out to be
like a DiGiorno's Pizza,

just folded over and
thrown in the oven,

what do I get out of it?

Well, I mean, regardless

you're gonna get a delicious
homemade treat so.

What? The calzone?
That's the treat?

Oh, God. Okay. And what
happens if I don't like it?

Then what do I get
out of it? Nothin.

That's just, that's
just not possible.

A homemade treat.

I'm back!

Hello.
Hi.

Smells good!
Mm-mm.

Hey baby. I remembered
the salad dressing.

Why didn't you make the
one that you make? The one...

I didn't have any time.

Just tell me next time
and I'll make it.

Well, then you would
know my secret recipe.

Oh, oh I didn't realize.

The stew smells
amazing. What is that?

Like cinnamon?
Smells so good.

Will you take this?

What is that?
Beef beef stew.

I know, but what's that smell?

Clove?
It's just beef.

So, did you get the mac?
The applications?

I didn't send them.

Are you serious?

Yeah, I'm serious.

What the fuck! Why?

What the fuck?
Give me a break.

What do you mean,
give you a break?

Why didn't you send them?

It's like a really bad time.

It's a great time.

No, it's not a great time.

Why?

We can barely pay Susan, okay.

What does that mean?

What do you mean,
what does it mean?

It means we haven't
had a new client

in forever and all of
Grandpa's clients are dying off.

Yeah, but that's
not your problem.

Yeah, well that's really
easy for you to say.

Yeah it is easy for me to say.

And it's easy for
you to say too.

You don't get it.

Look, I love you. It's
your life. It's your life.

I have to go to the bathroom.

Check these tomatoes, or does
it matter? It doesn't matter.

Dad, will you get
the ah, cornbread?

Hey.
Hey.

Yeah. I think it's an
incredibly good idea.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

You look wan.

Wan?
Hm-mm.

Are you sleeping? You've
got bags. You're all puffy.

Yeah, I'm sleeping.

I should have Bronwen
make an elixir for him.

I have a friend who makes
these incredible energy tonics

that stimulate everything.

Your liver, your
gallbladder, you kidney's...

I don't, I don't think that
elixirs are dad's thing.

Well, maybe not... What
does it taste like?

It tastes like shit.

Garbage, but so good for
you. Cleansing, healing.

Bronwen's amazing.

She did Reiki on me last
month, it was incredible.

Right.
Mm-mm.

You should get Reiki done.
Paul, you would love Reiki.

And, what's Reiki?
I mean, what is it?

It's energy work essentially.

It helps you release emotional
blockages and clear out pathways

and just makes you feel
awesome in general.

Okay.

Paul, how's the practice doing?

Great.

Yeah? Business is booming?

Yeah, we're trucking
along and...

Good. Awesome.

How's the um, the
apartment search going?

Good.

Have you found anything?

Not yet, but I have a few leads.

You have to be out by the first.

I know, I know, I know.

Well, why don't you
just move in with me?

Well, I mean you're at
my house every night.

Well, it's not every night.

I mean, rents really high
right now, you know.

I mean, it just makes sense.

Or, you could move in here

until you find a place
that's suitable.

There's plenty of room, the
door's always open to you.

Thank you brother. That is a
very generous offer Paul um...

Thank you.

I mean it makes sense right?

That's what I'm saying. Right?

Yeah, I mean, you're
going to regret it though,

because I'm a complete
and utter slob.

Like I already don't know that.

I know but once all my
stuff is there. Alright.

So you'll move in.

Yeah.
That's great.

Why not.

And you guys can have
dinner at our house.

And a little tap, tap, tap.

Close and grind and move
side to side for me.

Perfect.

And tap, tap, tap.
One, two, three.

Hold and close, grind
side to side. Perfect.

Alright.

Mirror.

let's just take a look and
see what we've got here.

Uh-huh.

Okay, Mrs Olstead,
be sure to floss.

We'll see you next time.

Who's next?

Um, no one today.
Mrs. Koppleson canceled.

Dad?

Yeah, I was thinking, um.

I think we need some new blood.

We could, could advertise.

That's not, that's
too expensive.

We have to, we have to spend
money to make money right?

I could call, I could do, I
could do some research.

Who would you call?
I don't know.

Look at bus ads or call
some newspapers...

I'm not comfortable with that.

Okay.

You feel good.

Yeah?
Mm-mm.

Ah, it's amazing.

Ah. So, what are his ah? What
are your brother's symptoms?

Oh um, he's really uptight,

Take this.
Thank you.

Judgemental, he's rigid and.

I don't want a
character assasination,

I just want his symptoms.

Oh. He's um, he's
really ah, depleted.

His like energy is gone.

He's all sucked in and wan
and he's not sleeping good.

Okay, I'll give
him a liver tonic

and something for
his gallbladder.

Okay.

Alright. That's not going
to happen but alright.

He really should. I can help
him better if he's here.

How about you?
How are you doing?

You feel good, so
things are good. What?

Jesse asked me to
move in with him.

Yeah, last night in front
of my family at dinner.

Wow.
Yeah.

Wow.
What the F right?

No joke that's. Did
you...are you...you're...

Yeah, I don't know.

Yes, good, good.
I'm flipping out about it.

You wouldn't be you if you
didn't flip out about it.

Its great, it's fine, it's
normal, it's normal.

Really?

I mean, he was supposed to
be my rebound. You know.

Yeah.

Just my get back
in the game guy.

Isn't it awful. Something
beautiful happened.

Is it?

It actually have ...is it?

I dont' know. Is it being tied
down again going to be awesome?

Or is it going to be
like a cage and like...

No, honey. I keep telling you,
I have always told you,

you have something
that, yes started sexually.

And it's grown into
something beautiful.

And that's what happen
for me and Charlie,

we started out
that way and that

was the most meaningful
relationship of my entire life.

And you know what,

I didn't even appreciate
what I had until Charlie past.

It wasn't until after. And I, I,

I just don't want
you to fuck it up.

I don't want you
to fuck it up.

Alright.

Just appreciate it. Ok.

Alright, cheers.
Gratitude.

Gratitude. Appreciate.

What time's your first victim?

Um...Oh, ten minutes ago.

Here take these. Take these.
I mixed these for you.

This is my special blend,
very proud of that.

I'll bring the tonic
down later, okay.

Oh, and I will put your
check in the box.

Oh yeah! Two months.

I know, two months, I'm sorry.

Can I help you?

Um, yeah, Jenny sent me.

She said I could get
a free cleaning.

Oh, ah, Okay. Um, Jenny...

Oh, Henry, you came.

Yeah, it's okay. Come back.

Okay, you ready? Open up.

What, what, what are you doing?

Oh hey dad.
This is Henry.

He ah, we know each
other from Cafe Fiore.

Hello.
Hello.

You know each other how?

Oh, I work there.

He makes my coffee
every morning.

Yeah, I just figured that
the chair was empty,

so I'd just give
him quick polish.

What do you mean?

Well, I didn't want to bother
you, you know. He's my friend,

He hasn't had a
cleaning in, in awhile.

That's not right.

What do you mean?

You don't have the training.

I've seen you do it
like a thousand times.

Well, I think it'd be better
if you stayed on your side.

Don't you?

So, when was the last
time you saw a Dentist?

About five years ago.

Oh, well, you're due.

Ah, G3.

The mirror.

Okay, let's open up
and take a look.

Alright, what have we
got going on here?

I'm going to start
you face down,

under the top sheet and ah,

you can hang your things here.

I'll see you in a second.
Alright thanks.

Is it warm enough in here?

It feels nice.

I start with lite
pressure at first okay,

and you tell me if you
want me to adjust it.

Okay.

Hey.

Hey.

How's it going?

Okay.

How's your day?

Shitty.

Well, why don't you
come over here

and I'll give you a back rub.

Oh. that sounds nice.

Oh, it's tempting. But ah,

I have so much packing to do.

Oh, okay. Um, I'll see
you tomorrow then?

Yeah.

You okay?

Yeah, yeah, I'm
okay. I'm just ah,

I don't know. I'm
just in a funky mood.

I'll call you in
the morning okay?

Call me when you get up.

I will.

I love you.
Me too.

Bye.
Alright. G'night.

E3.

Dad, he's like totally
freaking out.

Mirror.
He loves you.

He says you cured him.

Cured him of what?

Well, he had this horrible
pain. It was in his jaw.

TMJ?
Yeah.

Temporomandibular
Joint disorder.

Right, right. It was so bad
that he had to stop singing.

Since he's left office
and he's had no pain.

My grand-daughter has TMJ.
Maybe you could cure her.

Well, that's doubtful Mrs Olsen.

But if she comes in, I'd
be happy to take a look.

Let's open please. Alright.

Oh... I hate to disappoint
you, but if you came

here hoping that I could somehow
magically take away your pain,

I can't do that.

Okay. I understand.

Do you?
Yes.

Just do whatever you did for
the last guy. The guy you cured.

I, I didn't cure him.

Okay.

Just so long as you understand.

Okay.

Okay, and open, and...

Mr...

What happened?

Word of mouth.

Mr. Harris?

Hi, this is Abby. Due to some
unforeseen circumstances,

I will not be seeing any

clients for the time being. I'm
sorry for any inconvenience that

this causes anybody and ah, I
hope to be back soon. Namaste.

And Abby came running in here,

Grandpa Douglas had just
mixed a batch of this...

and everywhere it
was all over his face.

I was sitting right where you
are and giggling and I mean ...

Oh my gosh, Look
what else came.

Look what you are
doing for people.

I dont', I don't understand it.

It's not like I'm doing
anything differently.

Henry's singing again.

Well, that that's great, but
I'm not responsible for that.

He thinks you are.

Alright.

To my favorite Dentist.

Family dentistry.

I'm going to take the
car out for a bit.

Oh, hey Henry.
Hey Jenny.

Did you come back
to see my dad again?

Um, well, both of you actually.

I um, wanted to give you
tickets to my show.

Oh, oh wow, thank you.

Um, it wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for your dad.

That's incredible. Thanks.

No, it's just a little invite
only thing. It's no big deal.

No, that's cool. We'll
definitely, definitely come.

Cool um, I ah, I
made this for you.

Oh, is this your music?

No, it's just some songs
that I thought you'd like.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

That's so, that's
really sweet. Thanks.

Um, I gotta go, but I, I'm
really looking forward to this.

Cool.

Thank you.

See you there.

Brandon said he's
headed down to Galway.

Craking, Galway,
it's the same thing.

He's really heading
down there...

Hey, Jesse.
Jenny, hey.

Hey.

I'm good. I'm doing good.

Is that the

it's, well it's ah, it's
not a hot pocket.

Wow, that, that is
not a hot pocket.

God, you really
didn't didn't need

I know, but I was, I
was, I was gonna,

you know I was
gonna do it anyway

because I, well, I love to cook

and the conversation
sort of inspired it, so.

God this smells great.
I mean, I feel

No, no don't feel, I
mean it was, it's nothing.

It's totally not
anything you know. Um,

Thank you
I'll see you.

Yeah, um. Hey Jenny,
thanks, this is really nice.

Abby, what?

Will you do me a favor?

Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm good.

Will you take your shirt off?

What?

Will you kiss me?

What?

Will you kiss me?

What the fuck?

Abby!

Hey, Reiki. What is Reiki?
That's what Abby's friend does.

And um, how long have
you had this pain?

Oh, for like, ever. That's
what if feels like at least.

Well it started in a
kind of on and off way.

Um, I was still working on the
boat, so it was before 1998.

Right, right.

And um, then it
started to get real bad.

And it's right um,
right in here?

It's both sides.
Both sides.

Both sides hurts.

So that was before 1998 when
it started and then ah...

And after 1998?

Yeah ah, is started
getting really bad,

really persistent all the time.

You know, and um. So that
was like when I got divorced,

so that was back in like 2005.


Thanks for seeing me.
I've heard great things.

Well, let's let's not get
our hopes up too high,

but ah, we'll see
what we can do.

Wow. Okay, what's
going on with you?

I don't, I don't know.

You're energy is, just
completely waperjaw.

I just, I don't know,
I don't know,

I don't know. I just,
I feel really weird.

Everything is weird,
I don't know.

Yeah, I just. I,
I just, I feel off.

Well, you're energy is off.

It's completely all over the
place and incredibly fearful.

I feel like I can't,

I don't know You can't?

With everything I can't.
Like with Jesse I can't.

I don't want him to
touch me, I can't connect.

I don't know how to, I don't
know, is there something?

Yeah. Too much here.

When's the last time you guys
just went out and you know...

when's the last time you
went dancing? Hiking?

I don't know. I can't I just.
I need you to fix me please.

You can fix yourself.

I can't.

Maybe you need
physiological trigger.

Have you ever tried MDMA?

Oh yeah. It's like a big deal in
certain psychotherapy circles.

Are you fucking
with me right now?

No. Charlie and I tried it.

We did it. It was a
great way for us to...

reconnect. What?

I, I just don't know
where I would even get it.

Hold on.

Wow.

I haven't looked there
since... anyway.

One for you, one for Jesse.

Think of it as a hall pass.

Permission slip to just let

go of your fear and
embrace the world.

Or not.

Oh my God! I'm such a jerk,
I'm so sorry, I am so late.

Ah, that looks amazing.

Oh Bronwen had a cancellation
and I just tried to sneak in

and it just went way over.

Um, but I think she
had a really great idea.

What's that?
Look what she gave me.

What is that?

Ecstasy.

Ecstasy? A-awesome.

Yeah, I know! I thought it could
be really good for us right now.

Um, I kind of want to do it
before Paul and Jenny gets here,

but we should probably
wait to do it til they leave.

Probably.

What's wrong.

Nothing um, ecstasy huh?

What do you think?

Abby, I think you're acting a
little bit nuts is what I think.

Why?

We haven't even had a
chance to talk about

what happened yesterday
at the shop.

Yeah, I know I just
I Wh-what was that?

You come in then you take off
and then you just leave?

Yeah.

Imagine how that made me feel.

taking drugs right now
is what we need to do?

I mean, I think that's the last
thing that we need to do.

I think we need to stop and and

and get real with each
other for a second.

I'm being real with you.

Abby, you're an hour and
a half late for a dinner

that I've been cooking for your
family, which is totally fine

But then you waltz in here with
drugs in your hand and and..

I'm sorry it may be me, but
it feels a little bit weird.

I don't know, I just
thought it would be...

What, you need to
take some sort of,

you know, drugs,
to be with me?

No, no, God, no. I just
thought it would be fun

I'm just saying like,

you're just acting a
little bit different.

I know.

And is there something
going on with you? I mean?

Yeah. I just wanted to do
something that might be fun.

I don't know.
It was stupid.

So stupid, it was
stupid. Stupid idea..

No it's not stupid. I just
caught me off guard and and..

okay, they're here.

You know, just forget I
said anything about it.

It's stupid.

No, it it's... ecstasy.

Hey guys. Yay salad,
thank you, Come on in.

Here's some wine.
Thanks

You guys find a seat.

It's kind of
incredible actually.

I mean, you're like
changing lives.

Yeah you are. Yeah,
Henry, he's gonna,

he hasn't performed
in like two years.

I mean that's because of you.

You should feel really
really good about that.

That's great Paul.

Yeah.

Jesse's organizing a 30mile
urban bike race downtown.

Oh, c'mon.
You are.

It's a bike ride, bike ride.
It's not a race.

I thought it was like a race.

No, it's like a group ride.

Oh group ride.
Yeah.

That sounds really
cool actually.

And what's the point?

Fun.

Can you pass your plate please?

That was really really good.
Thank you.

It was really delicious.
Thank you.

How is it being
roomies you guys?

Um, I'll let you know when
I, when I finish packing.

Someone's being lazy.

Yeah.

You're not moving in?

I am moving in.

This weekend we're gonna
tackle it. Just been busy.

Oh Paul, I got you that
elixir from Bronwen.

She said she wanted
to see you in person,

but I told her that was
probably never gonna happen.

Why'd you say that?

Because you said
you'd, I don't know.

Here. Her tonic.
Knock yourself out.

What are these?

Ecstasy.

What? Are you taking that?

Ah, yeah.

Why are you taking ecstasy?

It's a hug drug Paul.

I'm addicted. I'm actually
a fucking drug addict,

I wanted to tell you about it.
Who wants dessert?

Cheesy pudding.

That tofu was so, I don't
usually like tofu and I just...

Oh thanks. I cooked it in like
really special olive oil. So.

Welcome.
Thank you.

So did you have a particular
goal in mind for today?

Um, no. Just, I'm curious.

Okay.

You know Abby, my sister,
she, said that it's amazing.

I think it is. I think
you're going really enjoy it.

So why don't we just
get started into

the session and see
where it takes us.

Okay.
Okay.

I'll take your coat for you.

How's the temperature
feel in here? Okay?

In here?
Yeah.

Um, it's good.

Oh. You don't need to remove
your clothes for Reiki.

I'm sorry.

No, it's fine.
Sorry. No.

No, you know what you're
actually if you would,

if you are more comfortable

I'd love you to remove
your clothes.

I mean if you want to,
if you feel comfortable.

No.

Okay, so if you want
to just climb up here

and get comfortable
with your head this way.

Oh, wow, okay.

That's the most interesting
way anyone's ever gotten

on my Reiki table before.

Okay. Just put my head up there.

Yes.

Okay.

I, that looks actually
really comfortable,

but I should have
been more specific.

I meant on your, if
you can get on your

back with your head up here.

Oh, okay.
Perfect.

Like that?
Yes.

Okay. Is that good?

That's perfect. Just lie,
if you let your feet,

your legs lie flat
on the table.

Yeah. Just to completely
let your legs fall

where they, let your feet fall

Like that.
Just absolutely relax.

Let every muscle just
relax. Your hands.

Okay.

Just resting comfortably
at your side.

Alright Yeah, just
get comfortable

Alright.
Everything's fine, this is good.

Maybe you should picture
yourself someplace

where you feel the
most comfortable.

The place where you feel safe,

the place where you feel
happy. You picture that.

The office, like at my office.

Your office?

Um, maybe we should
try to get out

of the office and
go to the beach

and sit on the sand and feel
the warm sun on your skin.

I'd rather, I'd rather
be at the office.

Okay, great.

So is there a favorite chair in
your office? Or a favorite...

I like the back
room The back room

where I look at x-ray's

where you look at x-ray's, okay.

Well, you look at x-rays in your
back room and I will do Reiki.

Okay. Just get in your back
room and close your eyes.

Are you're eyes closed?

Yep.

Huh. Okay. Wow.

Are you alright?

That was, that was great.

Uh-hum. Nah. I just want to
know um, what it's about.

Yeah. Like how you're
doing, what are you?

How are you doing it?

How, how how are you
doing it? What are you

Well, do you want to
learn how to do Reiki?

Yes.

Because I can, I mean, I can
show you how. I can teach you.

Great. Great.

I can, but it is energy work,
you know that don't you.

Are you aware that
it's energy work.

Energy.

And I channel energy into you

to help you balance
your energy and.

You know what, why
don't we just for today,

why don't I work on you and
you can feel what it feels like

and then we can
meet another time

and I can explain
everything to do with Reiki.

You could even be a Reiki
master if you wanted to be.

Is that what you want.

You could be a Reiki master!

How's that sound?

It sounds good.

Okay. So, get back
in your office.

Okay. Alright.

Okay. Oh, good.
Scooch down a little bit.

Okay.
That's perfect.

Is that good?
Yes.

Alright. Okay? Ready?
Here we go.

Okay.
Let's go.

Pop your legs up on the
couch. Just cross them over.

Can you get that up there?

Stay still, stay still. Just
don't let go. Don't let go.

Just relax down a little bit.

Good, see, you're
okay, I've got you.

You're, you're
safe. You're okay.

You know what? Put your
legs down on the floor.

Just put them down on
the floor, that's better.

And onto the next position,

just put them over the
heart, above the breast.

Okay, move down onto the lower
abdomen, yeah, right down there.

So what we're gonna do
Dillon, in the first step is

we're just going to
put some articulate...

Are you ready?

Alright.

One, two, three...

How's that feel?

Can you...Better?

I think it is.

Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

Thank you
Oh you're welcome.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

I felt something.
Did you feel something?

Come on in.

See how that is.

Good.

Looks good.

Thank you.

I went to Bronwen.

What do you mean?

I, I went.

You did?
Mm-mm.

Did you like it?
Yes.

I'm impressed.
Thank you.

And how, how are you?

Really?
Mm-mm.

I don't think she's fine.

What do you mean?

I think you need to
let her go Paul.

her hostage or anything.

I just think she wants to
be doing other things.

I think she wants, I think
she wants to go to school.

In fact, I know she
wants to go to school.

She has never said anything
to me about school. I know..

Because she thinks
you don't want her to go.

She thinks you want her.
Never even...

Never even discussed...

gainful employment.

Teaching her,

has zero interest in.

The light in this room.

It felt like

morning but it wasn't.

I remember your bed
on the floor with...

just a box spring.

I remember UB-40
on the turntable.

"You Shoot Me Down With Flames."

I remember

you asking me if I trusted you.

I remember you opened your
button fly's with one "foop"

and I almost started
cracking up.

I remember, I
remember our bodies,

like one thing, like
one complete thing.

I remember feeling like
maybe I didn't have a body.

Did it hurt?

I don't know.

That part I don't remember.

Was I your first heartbreak?

Yeah.

I think I knew I was gonna
be even as I was doing it.

I'm sorry. I'm really
sorry for that.

It's okay.

Hey.
Hi.

Do you, do you want to go
maybe see some music with me?

Um, right now?
Yeah.

Um, yeah. Yeah sure. Um,
let me just grab a jacket.

Okay.

â™ª Is it a blessing or a curse

â™ª to be found, to be found.

â™ª Is it a burden or a gift

â™ª to be bound, to be bound.

â™ª Are you coma or dot to
my run on sentence. â™ª

â™ª For I was just a word
that refused to be defined. â™ª

â™ª Oh oh oh ohohooooo oh oh oh.
Oh oh oh ohohooooo oh oh oh. â™ª

â™ª There is freedom
when you say, â™ª

â™ª I am through,
I am through. â™ª

â™ª But for something to begin
all in you all in you. â™ª

â™ª I'm now a horse
without a race, â™ª

â™ª I will gallop
where I please. â™ª

â™ª And when those
say, no hesitation, â™ª

â™ª I'll go down
upon my knees. â™ª

â™ª Oh ohooooooo oh oh oh.
Oh ohooooooo oh oh oh. â™ª

â™ª Oh ohooooooo oh oh oh.
Oh ohooooooo oh oh oh. â™ª

â™ª My lonely days
are over, over. â™ª

â™ª Oh my lonely days
are over, over. â™ª

â™ª My lonely days are over.

â™ª And love is love is love,

no matter who you're
thinking of. â™ª

â™ª So you can open
all those doors â™ª

that someone closed
so long ago. â™ª

â™ª Cause you're bolder
and when you say â™ª

â™ª I am through, I am through.

â™ª Hope for something
to begin. â™ª

How long were you
a messenger for?

Like five or six years.

Is that when you first got
into like, like all the biking?

Yeah. It was just so
much different then,

just a different vibe.

It was more my anarchist stage.

Anarchist cycling?

Yeah.

I was just one angry dude.

That's hard to imagine.

Is it?

Yeah. You're just,
you're so um...

So what?

Have you ever

wanted to kiss
someone so badly

that it hurts your skin?

Ah, Jenny.

I don't know what to say.

You don't, you don't
have to say anything.

Maybe you, maybe you
could just kiss me.

It wouldn't, it wouldn't
have to mean anything.

Jenny, that's a terrible idea.

I, I know. I know,
I Look I'm sorry.

I mean, you know
I love Abby right?

I, I know, I know, I know.

Are you okay?

Yeah.

Are you sure?

Maybe could you
just, just hold me?

Yeah. Yeah, sure.

Hey,
Hi.

Thank you.
