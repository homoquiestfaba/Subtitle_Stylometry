Good evening, I'm Marci Feld.

Oh, thank you.

Please! Oh, please, stop it!

Enough. That's enough.

Tonight, the American Jewish
Federation...

You Jews, you wonderful Jews.

Who needs Santa Claus?
Am I right?

Tonight, the AJF presents
its highest honor,

its Global Humanitarian Award,

to the finest human being
I have ever known.

This award goes to my father,
Mr. Ben Feld.

We love you, bubby!

Ben! We're here for you!

Isn't he handsome?

And kosher, right?

Love you.

Now, most of you may think of my
father as, first and foremost,

an incredibly successful
corporate legend,

but he has always taught me
about responsibility

and giving something back.

He would say, "Sweetheart, you
are the prettiest, the smartest,

"the most perfect girl
in the whole world,

so you must reach out
to all of those who aren't."

Powerful.

Doesn't Marci
look fabulous?

Ultra-Marci.

Mega-Marci.

The full Marci.

Ten years ago,

we opened our first
shelter for the homeless,

helping those in need
of a bed, counseling,

and shampoo and conditioner.

Next came a drug rehab program
called "Marci Cares,"

and today, there are 25
branches of Marci Cares

all across the tri-state area.

Can you imagine being
addicted to heroin?

Oh, it's heartbreaking.

But does the weight
stay off?

I only wish that my mother
Sheila could be with us

on this joyous occasion.

But, as some of you know,
six years ago,

while we were opening
a free clinic in Johannesburg,

she was tragically killed by
a savage South African leopard.

It is in her memory

that I would now like to present
this medal of mercy,

a medal from Marci.

Tonight, this award
goes to my father,

Mr. Ben Feld!

We have problems, sir.

Daddy?!

Daddy, where are you going?

Was it the entree?

Daddy...

Daddy...

What's going on?

Marci, incoming.

This way, Miss Feld.

Daddy, what is wrong? I...

Shh! Sweetheart, sit.

The corporate crisis
centering on Ben Feld

has begun to escalate
out of control.

I got here as
fast as I could.

Daddy, what is this?

Daddy's busy.

...include the notorious
urban record label

called Felony Assault.

Earlier today,
that label released

a new CD by controversial
gangsta rap star Dr. S.

Dr. S has been
a hard-core success...

I don't know this person.

He's a rapper.

His songs are known
for their extreme sexual

and often violent content.

His latest release, however,

is by far his most provocative.

Controversy is erupting,
protesters are converging

on Feldco headquarters
in Manhattan.

An angry mob is calling for
blood, specifically the blood

of mogul Ben Feld...

Oh, Daddy, is that your picture?

...honored tonight
as a great humanitarian.

I am here with senator

and leading media watchdog
Mary Ellen Spinkle.

Oh, no.

I am appalled.

Is she wearing
a helmet?

I am outraged.

I am so disgusted

that I can barely speak...
but I will.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

This recording
is unspeakably offensive,

not just to all Americans,

but to all human beings
everywhere.

I will not quote the lyrics
because, as a Christian,

I cannot even pronounce
some of the words.

But let me just read you
some of the song titles:

"Shoot the Teacher."

Oh, my...

Yes!
Not good.

"I Am the King of Your Mouth."

Very nice.
Uh-oh. - Ooh!

"You My Special Bitch."

Wait...
Mmm!

"I Love You Because
I'm High."

"Six Grades Are Plenty."

Lane, did you ask Legal?
Do I really own this label?

You bought it years ago
as part of a package.

"It Ain't My Baby Because
I Don't Like You."

This is it.

...and "The Power in my Pants."

Has Dr. S gone too far?

I don't blame these rappers,

I blame the man who profits
from this perversion!

I blame the man who makes
his dirty millions

from the wholesale slaughter
of our children's innocence!

I blame an American Satan,
Ben Feld!

I am calling for a complete
boycott of all Feldco products

including movies, newspapers,
TV shows,

and DVDs!

A boycott?
A boycott?!

Are you listening to this,
Mr. Feld?

Or I should say "Mr. Filth."

Ben Feld...

you are a dead man!

Ben?
Uh-oh...

Ben!

Daddy!

Ben, don't die!

The moral firestorm
blazing around Ben Feld

has raged into a white-hot
economic inferno.

A what?!

Pickets have closed
record stores nationwide.

My God... I'm choking...

We have contacted Tubby Fenders,

the president of Felony Assault,

who is currently serving time

in a penitentiary.
Look...

Yo.

Mr. Fenders, what about Dr. S?

Dr. S would never apologize!

He would never bow down
to the white man's censorship!

Just like me, he has been
unjustly oppressed and accused!

Tubby Fenders, the president
of Felony Assault Records.

Give me that remote!

Big baby!

I can't believe this.

Everything I worked for
my whole life,

it's all going
to crumble.

Baby, I'm so sorry.

Daddy!

Because you
have to see all this.

Because I...

I just wish I had a son.

Why would you want a son?

Someone to take over,
to take charge,

so that you wouldn't
have to worry.

Someone we could trust.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

I just two weeks, we are going
to put Ben Feld on trial

before the entire civilized
world and China...

That's it! That's it!

I'm out of here!

What?!

Uh-oh. Dr. Skellar!

I need Dr. Skellar!

Oh, Daddy! Look...
Look what's happening.

I can't stay here!
I... I...

You get back in that bed,
Your Highness.

Mr. Feld...

Mr. Feld, you are an
extremely sick man.

Now, no visitors,

and nurse, get rid
of that television

and I need 10 cc's
of Valium right now.

Oh, thank you.

For your father.

Oh.

Ben...
What?

I'm going to put you
in complete isolation

for two weeks
for your own good.

No cell phones, no faxes,
no Internet, nothing.

Like the '80s?

I'm warning you, Ben.

If you have any more
stress, it could kill you.

Sweetheart, please,
just go.

You don't think

the rules apply to you, do you?

Ben, you're in real danger.

You're a very sick man.

Thank God you're rich.

You're here in this hospital

and you're going to stay here
until I release you.

Sorry.

Marce!

Oh, Marci,
I can't believe it!

Are you all right?
Is your dad okay?

Have you bathed?

Look, chocolates!

Did you get a chance
to bathe yet?

They're for you...
and your dad.

But I feel so useless.

I love my father so much
and I can't even help him.

And he doesn't... he doesn't
really want me to try.

Why not?

He said he wished he had a son.

Maybe he's right.

Maybe I'm not strong enough
or smart enough.

Maybe I am just a socialite.

Excuse me?

Just a socialite?

You serve on the boards
of three major museums.

You are a guest editor

at Vogue, Vanity Fair,
and Mademoiselle.

And last year alone,
you raised over seven figures

for literacy, muscular dystrophy
and cancer.

In this town, you are cancer.

No, but this involves law suits
and spin control

and the whole worldwide
entertainment industry.

Which is your life.

You introduced Princess Diana
to Mother Teresa

at your bat mitzvah.

They had cake.

Well, not Diana.

Time Magazine has declared you

the most charming white woman
in America under 50.

Oh, except we're
talking about rap.

And, you know, the inner cities

and censorship and the cultural
legacy of black people.

Well, I happen
to adore black people.

Word.
Word up.

Word perfect.

You can get anybody
to do anything you want.

It's your gift.

Yeah, yeah,

yeah, and my dad
is being isolated.

But I've only got two weeks
until the hearings.

So get out there...

...and show your father
just what you're capable of.

You say, "Watch out, America,
here comes Marci."

Yeah, I'm going to go see
that Dr. S,

in person, on his own turf.

I'll explain everything
and we can work together.

Marci cares.

Marci loves.

Marci saves her father's life.

Yay!
Oh!

So where is this Dr. S?

Uptown.

Uptown.
All the way.

Yeah, someone call

for a doctor?

You say you want the power,
the power to see

You say you want the power,
the power to be

You want to see the power,
then give it a glance

Come on, I got the power,
the power in my pants

You say you want the power,
the power so fine

Screaming for the power,
the power that's mine

If I showed you all the power,
you'd go into a trance

I have you in my power,
with the power in my pants

We want the power

Try not to stare

We want the power

Give me some air

We want the power

Give, give, give

Give me some drums

We want the power

Here it comes

You say you want the power,
the power to come

You want to ride
the power to the maximum

You say you use the power
to enhance romance

Come on, take some power,
the power in my pants

You say you need the power,
the power supreme

You want to touch the power,
till you make it your dream

You play with the power...
Excuse... Hi.

You know it's your chance

Got a magic wand, yeah,
the power in my pants

Hold on to your purse.

We want the power

'Cause he got game

We want the power

You're playing games

All right!
Yeah!

Feel my song inside your thong

The power that stick,
that knows every trick

If you can't live with it,
then you don't know dick.

Thank you.

Sit down.

Sit your asses down.

All right.

How y'all feeling?

Sick!

Ain't y'all glad
there's a doctor in the house?

Yeah!

I want to give
a special shout out

to someone who is near
and dear to my heart.

I think you all know
who I'm talking about.

That's right.

She's a recording artist,

and she's got a workout video

and her own perfume.

And she got an ass you just want
to take pictures with.

You know who I'm talking about...

the Booty Monster herself...

Miss Yolanda Quinones.

Yolanda!

Am I late?

You're late,
but you're right on time.

Come on, sit down

while the Doctor
put on the clinic.

Hey, Medic, show 'em
how we operate.

Hi.

Go. Go talk to him.

For your father.

Mingle.

Spanky, here.

Coming off,

coming through
and going back.

Dr. S, hi.
Marci Feld.

It's a pleasure.

Really.

Who are you?

Um, I'm Ben Feld's daughter.

Anyway, I can see
you're very busy,

so I'm just going
to take a second.

But we really do have to chat

about, you know, your new CD.

Why?

Well, I'm sure you know
all about the hoo-ha.

Please. Ooh!

I'm also sure you're every bit
as upset about it as I am.

You know.

You're upset?
You're hot and bothered?

Um...

Anyway, I have a plan.

You do, huh?
Yeah.

You're just going to love it.

I bet I will.

Oh, yeah.

Ew, this is...
all covered with you.

You know, you could sell that.

Oh, yeah?

On eBay.
Oh...

30 seconds.

Oh, okay.

Well, here it is.

Um... next week,
you're supposed to appear live

at the MTVAwards.

Perfect... it's global,
millions of people watching.

Just the perfect place

for you to say to the entire
world, "I'm really sorry.

"I went too far.

Ben Feld is fabulous,
and I apo..."

I'm good. Thank you.

"...and I sincerely apologize."

Um, well, tomorrow morning
at 10:00...

I thought we could
kick things off, you know,

with a public relations
event, sort of, in a way.

Five seconds.

How do I look?

You look amazing.

I got to run.

Stick around, all right?

Okay. You're too sweet.
I mean that.

It went very well.

He said to wait here,
and I don't know why.

Y'all take five.

What's happening?

Check this out.

I don't know if y'all
been tracking it,

but a lot of people
been coming down on the Doctor

for speaking his mind.

Folks like Senator Spinkle,

and the media.

And Mr. Ben Feld.

Guess who we got
in the audience tonight?

Who?

We got his little

goddamn daughter,
Marci Feld is here.

Kick her ass!

Kill her!

And she wants me...

No.
...to apologize...

Hell, no!

...and do some
public relation shit.

She wants me to change
who I am.

No!

Say, bitch!

Oh, my God.

Bring your pasty white ass
out here.

You get out there.

You tell him you are not
a bitch. Not always.

That's your answer
right there.

I'm a real nigger.

I don't change for no one.

I ain't changing shit.

Can I get an amen?

Amen!

You're out
of your element, baby.

You're out of your league.

And you're out
of your goddamn mind.

This is Harlem.

Get the hell out of my ghetto.

'Cause these people
ain't feeling you.

You know why?

'Cause you're not real.

You're unreal.

You're where real goes to die.

What do you mean I'm not real?

Authentic.

Talking about down.

Real is who you are.

And it's what you ain't.

Kill that bitch!

Shoot that bitch!

Whack, whack, whack,

whack, whack, whack, whack,

whack, whack, whack, whack...

Whack, whack...

Lauren.

I'm sorry.

...whack, whack...

Okay, okay!

If I can get real,
whatever the hell that means,

will you show up
tomorrow morning?

And how you going to get real?

What you going to do?
You going to rap for us?

No, I can't rap.

You can't rap?
Then I can't go. Bye.

Bye-bye.

All right, all right.

If I do rap,
do I have your word?

Word to your mother.

But you're going
to need a little beat.

Hold on.

What do you mean, a beat?

You can't rhyme if you
don't have no rhythm.

Hi, hi, hey, hey

Everybody have a nice day...

All right!

Okay.

It's okay.

Maybe she needs some bass.
Give her some bass.

Yeah, I need bass.

Give her some S! Yes!

Okay...

Hi, hi, I'm so real

Let me tell you how I feel...

God, this is so embarrassing.

She's so white.

I can't watch.

We know how you feel.

And I know what
you want to feel.

Oh!

But he's mine, bitch.

Okay, just give me another beat.

We're running out of beats.

Give her another one.
Go on.

Okay.

Now listen, I know
I suck at this, okay?

But it's my very, very
first time.

And I'm just not very musical.

Although I did love Lion King.

All right, so, but rapping.

Let me just think

for a minute, okay?

So, okay, so rapping,
it's about being...

about being honest...

"real," right?

Okay.

So, okay, okay, okay.

I would really like to talk
to all the women

in the audience...

in the house.

As you say.

Give me what you gave him.

Okay.

Mar-say!

Girlfriend.

Get down.

He says he's got the power

Somewhere in his pants

He says that I'm not real

That I don't stand a chance

Okay, I'm white, I'm blonde,
I'm Jewish

Could it get any worse?

But I have got a secret

The power in my purse

When I was very little,
my mom said to me

A man's just a man,
nothing comes free

Well, who can I trust
in this universe?

She said you trust the power,

You my goddamn lawyer,
just get me out of here.

Dr. S is joining
a public service campaign

to promote sexual abstinence.

Still, Feldco stock
continues to plummet.

Yo, Tubby!

Go, mama.

Did you hear about that Marci?

How could you let
that happen to me?

Baby, I'm in the joint, boo.

Tubby, you and I have a deal.

You promised me total
personal management.

That is why I signed
with your label.

You gave me
your word on Dr. S.

You said that we could be
a power couple.

It's under control.

I know we got to do something
about that bitch.

When, Tubby?

I'm on it.
I'll let you know, baby.

But he'll be here any second.

He gave me his word.

He's already cost us
over two hours.

You know, he's on his way.

He's in the car.
His people called.

Yo.

Oh, Dr. S.

I told you.

Oh, you look great.

Doctor, this is
your director, Todd.

Okay, what is this shit?

Well, we're making
a public service spot

sponsored by the Save
Our Families Foundation

and you are going to
be its spokesperson.

Isn't that the best?

Hold on, spokesperson for what?

Yes.

Let me introduce you
to your costars.

This is so major.

Just last week they sold
over 12 million copies

of their new CD.

What are you doing?

Look, they are huge.

This way.

Parents love them

because they are
non-threatening.

Now if you appear with them,

people will see that
you're not so, you know,

filthy and evil and disgusting.

Not that those are bad things.

You know, last night,

I thought you were just
some crazy-ass bitch.

Now I have three little words
to say.

"Thank you, Marci"?

"Bye, bye, bye."

If you don't do this,
I will call Feldco

and we will stop
shipping your CDs today.

And you will be dead meat.

Which also describes abstinence.

Okay, what do I got to do?

Come on, the press
will be here soon.

We've got all the magazines
and the papers.

Don't you love this?

Oh, it reminds me of
my playhouse when I was little.

Did you have a playhouse?

I did. - I did.
I did. - I did.

Okay. Dr. S, this is Mikey,

Jonathan, Adam and Kelly.

Dr. S, may I present
Boyz R Us.

What up?
Props to the Doctor.

Okay, why don't we
run through the song

so Dr. S can see what it is
he'll be doing with you.

Okay.

Watch it. Here.

Bell, please.

Okay, this will be
a full rehearsal

with cameras and everything.

You want to sit? No.
Can I get some lights, please?

And... action!

"A" mark.

Sexual abstinence spot,
take one.

Hold on... Hold on

Let's wait... Let's wait

Let's hold hands in the sunset

Let's date

What I feel for you is special

So let's not spoil it

Our bodies are a temple

Not a public toilet

Take care... Take care

Say whoa... Say whoa

If you see me coming

Girl, it's time to go

Let's be patient
till our wedding day

Till God tells us that it's okay

Till then,
let's stay six feet away

Girl, shut that gate

Hold off... Hold off

Hold off,
Hold off

Let's wait

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Let's wait.

Cut!

Love of God.
Perfect!

Wonderful! - Beautiful!
Wasn't that something?

Guys, that was really nice.

Can you get through?

Yeah, that was something.

Bravo.

Honestly.

And you're going
to introduce them.

Isn't that inspiring?

We have a responsibility
to our fans.

Yeah, we get so many
beautiful letters

from these sweet
little girls.

And their families.

And college-educated older men.

Dr. S?

Okay, I'm there.

But first, I'm gonna need
somewhere private to rehearse.

Of course.

With my dawgs.

Bell, please.

Okay.

You see?
I told you he'd be into this.

He's gonna make America say,

"Hey, let's give this guy
another chance."

We're lucky to have him.
Yeah.

"A" mark.

Sexual abstinence spot,
take two.

And action!

Hey, kids.

Gather 'round.

It's me, Dr. S.

And I know,
especially when you're young,

this world can be
a very complicated place.

So I want you to listen up

to some good pals of mine

'cause they got a very important
message for today's teens.

Hey, guy... Hey, guy

Let's date... Let's date

Let's date... Let's date

'Cause we're both
something special

Not straight

What I feel for you
is groovy

So let's enjoy it

I think your sister's pretty

But let's boy and boy it

I saw... I saw

You wink... You wink

And life is so much better

Now that we're in sync

Ah...

I really like
your smiling face

My beach house has a fireplace

We'll watch reruns
of Will and Grace

Let's fornicate

Hold on... Hold on

Hold tight... Hold tight

Let's date,
let's date, let's date

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Let's date.

That was so good.
Wasn't it?

Now please keep in mind
this is your last chance

to clean up your act.

You're lucky I thought
of bringing you tonight.

This party is such a fabulous
idea for our campaign.

Now people will see
that you're really decent

and helpful and nice.

Nice, my ass.

When you gonna wake up
and smell the brother?

What is that, rabbit?

Siberian chinchilla, 300 Gs.

What's that you got on?

Lab rat?

This is classic white mink.

Is that platinum?

Yes, ghetto fabulous.

What about your earrings,
those real diamonds?

Of course.
Wow.

I didn't know they made them
that small.

You know, you remind me
of someone in that outfit

with the jewelry and the hair.

Yeah, who?

Biggie? Tupac? DMX?

My Aunt Esther.

Welcome.

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

to our annual auction
to benefit CWNFITA,

Children With No Feeling
In Their Arms.

Okay.

It is a terrible illness still
affecting far too many wee ones.

Wee ones?

It's tragic.

They can't dial.

Ouch! Stop it!

Marvelous.

Thank you.

That's great.
All right.

Our first item is something
truly, deeply exciting.

It's dinner for two
with the handsome,

the totally dreamy
Mr. Donald Trump.

I love Donald.

She can't be real.

Who wants dinner
with Donald Trump?

You don't have to touch him.

Maybe he's changed.

That's his real hair.

This is whack.
Whack?

Oh, that means "bad."

I do volunteer work,
teaching black teenagers

to wear the correct size.

I'll be back. Excuse me.

Is that Chuck Berry?

Wow.

What is he doing?

You need some help, baby.

I'm here to back you up.

I'm... I'm working, okay?

Just go back to your seat.

It's okay.

We're working together
as a team.

They're old.
They don't have much time left.

Look,

shout out to the wee one.

Throw your hands up.

Stop it.

Hey.

We got to get these
wee ones some arms.

My first item up,

I need to talk
to just the ladies.

Fellas, take five.

He is so sexy.

He's a gangsta.

He raps about guns
and bitches and hos.

That's what I said.

'Cause I know you ladies all
beautiful and bangin' and alone.

Are you alone, mama?

I'm with my husband.

Yeah, you're alone.

Bam.

And you're all here

with your husbands
and your ex-husbands

and future ex-husbands,
but you're all alone.

I see it in your eyes.

Who's dis?

He's my fourth husband.

Your fourth husband.

Is he rich?

Not rich enough.

Then you're still alone.

And what do we have here?

Look at these lovely creatures
over here.

Hi, ladies.

Tell me the truth,
y'all ever get it on?

One bed, four bitches?
Be honest.

I'm telling you,

this room is just full
of lush, Ionely,

lovely

ladies.

Hey!

Don't touch.

Now, who's wearing that perfume

that got me all worked up,
turned on, turned out, huh?

Me. - Me.
Me.

Hey, hey,

now, now, don't fight,
delight.

That's right, ladies,

because you all deserve
something mo' better,

mo' blacker, mo' me.

Late at night you
want something hot

and homey.

You're not homey.

So, right now,
I'm offerin' a house call

from the doctor of love.

We gonna start the bidding
at 20 Gs.

He's a player.

We're his bitches.
