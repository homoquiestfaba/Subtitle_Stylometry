'Twasthe first day of December

when all through the house

not a creature was stirring,

not even Santa's spouse...

What are you doing?

What time is it?

It's December.

Christmas is in 25 days.

I'm looking for my hat!

Humbug!

Grinch.

The children were woken

with care by their pa...

Up, up, up, up, up, up!

Wake up! Ha!

Now, are you ready forsome
Christmas decorating?

Yes.

"Yes," who?

Yes, Santa.

Santa who?

Santa, sir!

That's more like it!

Now, where is private elf Susie?

Probably still sleeping, Santa, sir.

Well, let's go wake upthat lazy elf, huh?

Wake up, Susie! Christmas is coming!

Hoo! Haa!

And they greeted the day

with a wide-eyed awe...

Go away!

The Christmas treasures

were removedfrom safekeeping.

All right, catch this.

You were supposedto catch that.

No, you were!

No, you were...

Hey, hey, hey!

Peace on earth, huh?

The pride of the household

was the huge Christmas tree

which they decorated fully

for the neighbors to see.

Not straight.

Yes, it is.

It's falling over.

She's right.

You say that every year,
and every year, it doesn't.

Where are you going?

I'm going to get the string

so I can tie up the treeso
it doesn't fall over,

like I do every year.

She does not do thatevery year,

does she?

I do itevery year!

It's straight.

Look at that...

The exterior was always

such a glorious sight,

with a rainbow of colorsto
light up the night.

Tim!

Oh!

Uh, sorry, Dad.

The door was adorned

with a wreath made by mother.

Its handmade beautyfar exceeded all others.

Great, huh?

Okay, let's go.

That's a boy...

All right, how abouta blue one now?

Would you likea cookie?

I made themfrom scratch.

Yeah!

Pa and Tim assisted

the kind widow next door...

Thank you, Mrs. McKane.

And you take theseto your mother.

I'm sureshe'd like some.

What do you say?

Oh. Thank you.

You're welcome.

Thanks.

She rewarded them both

with Christmas goodiesgalore...

Are you ready?

Go for it, Dad.

All right, five...

four...

Three...

Two...

One...

Blast off!

I think we actually

have a chance of winning

the mayor's Christmasdecoration contest

this year.

Well, you know, we came close last year.

We came 41st, Mom.

Well, that was40 places better

than we didtwo years before that.

We've just got to improvethe
exact same amount,

and then we're goingto win that $5,000.

Oh, wedon't need

to win the mayor'scompetition.

We just need the houseto look pretty

for Christmas.

Well, I thinkwe're going to be

the best houseon the street.

The neighbors next door

liked modest decoration,

whilst those up the street

preferredcreature illumination...

Oh, hey, merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

Yeah.

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas!

Aren't the lights pretty?

It's too earlyfor Christmas lights.

It's hardly a weeksince Thanksgiving.

Well, I think they look nice.

So, did you writeyour letter to Santa?

Aw, Dad!

What?

How's he going to know what you want?

You mean, how are yougoing to know?

No, I mean Santa.

Mom and I havenothing to do with it.

Really.

The Wallaces' lights

were the best on the street

but to beat the whole
townwould be a great feat...

Mrs. Haynes, these framesare
in really bad shape.

Are you sure you don'twant to replace them?

Can you just repair them?

Sure, Mrs. Haynes,

I'll seewhat I can do,

but...

Let's see.

Ooh...

Hey, uh, Doris?

Mm-hm?

A sales rep leftthese
sample frames with us,

and I don't want to addany
more on to our line.

Can you throw these outfor me, please?

We're not carryingValentas anymore?

Yes, just, uh,

not this frame, hmm?

Oh.

Of course.

Okay, I'll, uh,

I'll toss them for you.

Thank you.

Just, um...

You know, Mrs. Haynes, it would be a shame

to throw out a perfectly
goodpair of frames.

I bet I could get your lenses to fit.

Would you like them?

That sounds wonderful.

Merry Christmas.

But of beingbest in the street

Bob should not speak too soon,

for one house was not
yetfor Christmas festooned.

I love you.

I love you.

But it had been sold

so soon it would bestrewn with decorations

and great festivity.

Oh, look at this.

You're going to love it.

Go pick out your room.

Hey, hey, Timmy!

Come on, we got two minutesto
get there, let's go!

Hope you didthe cat litter!

He'll do it later.

Hi, sweetie.

Do you know what?

The neighbors are moving
inacross the street.

We should say hi or something.

Great. Yeah. Maybewhen we get back.

Are we going to goChristmas
shopping tonight?

I can't.Susie's got basketball.

Well, how aboutafter dinner?

Yeah, maybe.

Okay. Come on, Timmy, let's go!

Hey, can you getthe other one?

Yeah.

Thanks, pal.

Bye, Susie!

Hey, Dad.

See you later.

Have a good game, Tim.

Hey, sweet pea.

He seems nice.

What?

Come on...

Oh, good evening.

It's still afternoon.

Well, whatever it is,
I hope you have a good one.

Come on, Lola.

â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride

â™ª In a one-horse open sleigh

â™ª Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells â™ª

â™ª Jingle all the...

â™ª We wish youa merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish youa merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª And a happy new year

â™ª Good tidings we bringto
you and your kin â™ª

I can't believethe nerve of those people!

How could they dosomething like that

when they onlyfirst moved in?

I don't think they
weretrying to show us up.

Well, it's notneighborly!

We had carolers first!

Did we not havecarolers, huh?

I think we hadcarolers first!

Maybe there could be

some kind of tragiccaroler accident, huh?

Maybe theirsprinkler system

could go off unexpectedly

and short them out.

We could put upsome more decorations.

Well, we gotta do something

if we're going to winthe competition.

It's not a competition.

Well, I mean...

You said we could bebest on the street.

What abouta Santa on the roof?

No.

Just a little one?

No.

Maybe just a few more lights.

Just... just enoughto give us the edge.

Yes!

All right, we'll be right back.

Okay...

Let's give it a try, huh?

It's magic time...

Hey-hey!

Awesome!

Amateurs!

Oh, hey, chocolate chip cookies!

My favorite.

Ah, ah, ah, ah,

they'refor the neighbors.

What neighbors?

The new neighbors.

Th-the new neighborswith
the singing carolers?

Yeah.

The new neighborswho
move in and immediately

try to show us upand make us look bad?

Those new neighbors?

They're new to our street.

We haven't even met them yet.

They're probablyreally nice.

Can you not see the carolers?

â™ª We wish youa merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish youa merry Christmas... â™ª

We're goingto go over there,

we're going to give themthe cookies,

we're going toofficially welcome them

to the street,

and you are goingto be neighborly.

Besides, the extra lights,

they give you the edge.

Can you not see that?

All right, you're right.

Yes, we will go over there

and say a nice helloto our new neighbors.

Not you.

You have a spelling testin the morning.

Ugh.

Hello?

Can I help you?

Yeah, hi. We're the Wallaces,

and we live rightacross the street,

and we thoughtwe'd just drop on in

and say "welcometo the neighborhood."

Well, thank you.

That's... That'svery nice of you.

I'm Mary.

Mindy. This ismy husband, Bob.

Hello. Nice to meet you.

Please, come on in.

Sure,

but, you know, we... we won't stay,

because, um, you mustbe really, uh...

So, uh, you mustbe busy, right?

Unpacking, and, uh...

Well, um...

You know, we wanted togive you some cookies

and just, you know, say hi.

Well, that'sso sweet of you.

Mindy made thosefrom scratch.

Oh, and they look delicious.

So, I... I sawyou guys, uh,

have those Christmasdecorations
up already...

They lookreally beautiful.

Thank you.

Yes, we're just tryingto
make sure that Chip feels...

That's our son... feels at home.

You know what it's like.

I mean, it's a new home,

new school, that sort of thing.

Plus, of course, my husbandabsolutely loves

his Christmas decorations.

He says it's not
Christmasunless they're all up.

Just like Bob.

Oh, so that's your houseacross the street?

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, lovelydecorations, too.

Thanks, yeah. Okay,
we'renot going to keep you.

Um, so we'll just...

I would love for youto meet my husband.

Just... just wait.

Stu!

Come and meet the neighbors!

And these are so lovely...

Look whatthey brought us, honey.

Oh...

Stu?

Bob?

Stu Jones?

Bob Wallace?

You twoknow each other?

This is...

Mindy, let's go.

What?

What in the worldwas that all about?

What just happened?

That man is evil!

He is a liar, and he is a cheat!

I can't believe he movedto Honeyview Lane,

and just beforeChristmas!

So, I take it you know Stu?

Oh, yeah, I know Stu.

I know Stu Jones all too well!

Go on.

We grew up together.

We were friends in high school.

Close friends?

Best friends.

We did everything together.

We were onthe football team together.

We did homeworktogether.

We were inEagle Scouts together.

We were even planning
ongoing to college together.

It was weird.

I mean, we... we would
finisheach other's sentences.

Like you were married?

More like we were twins.

I mean, sometimeswe didn't even talk.

I would show up at his house

to pick him up to go to school...

and find we were
wearingthe same clothes.

Sometimes we even
didexactly the same things

without telling each other.

So, what happened?

Well, the Christmas

before we graduated,

we were both delivery boysat the paper,

and they werehaving a contest.

Whoever soldthe most subscriptions

would win a bright red...

Honda motorcycle.

I mean, we were seniorsin high school.

To us, this wasthe coolest
thing in the world!

So, who won it?

Well, it's notthat simple.

We agreed we'd both go for it.

You know, may the best man win,

and everythingwas good and fine

until I found out

that Stu had beenselling subscriptions

to people in my delivery area!

Well, it wasn't likel
was going door-to-door

where he delivered the paper.

I sold all over town.

If they happened to livein
his area, then so be it.

I mean, it wasn't like I
wasasking for their address, or...

Didn't you need their address

in order to deliver their paper?

Yeah, but that was after

I'd already sold themthe subscription.

Anyway, I was upset.

We had a big fight,

I thought he was over it,

but instead...

I got a list of everyonethat
he delivered to,

and I called everyone

whose subscriptionwas about to expire,

and, uh...

I renewed their subscriptions.

Oh, no.

Oh, yeah.

He got credit for my customers.

Not full credit, mind you.

Renewals were only worthhalf a point.

So Stu finds out about
meselling to his customers,

and he goes nuts.

I mean, I couldn'tbelieve it!

What he did was so much
worsethan what I did.

I had to stealtwo of his customers

for every onethat he stole of mine.

Well, all's fairin love and war.

Not innewspaper motorcycle contests

between two best friends!

Sorry.

After that, our friendship was over.

We didn't speak to each
otherfor the rest of the year,

and then Bob...

went off to another college,

and we never saweach other again...

Till tonight.

So, who won, you or Stu?

It was a dead heat.

We came out equal.

Second.

So, who wonthe motorcycle?

Aw, who cares.

Some guy from the otherside
of the city, I think.

At least it wasn't Bob Wallace.

At least it wasn't Stu Jones.

Why did he have to move to Richmond?

We should neverhave left Shoreham!

I told you that!

He was going to be a dentist.

Maybe he thinks everybodyin
Richmond has rotten teeth!

A dentist,

what a racketthat is.

Check-ups everysix months?

You get your eyes checkedonce a year!

I mean, which would yourather lose, huh,

your teeth or your eyes?

Exactly!

We're going to have to move.

Sell the house!

No way!

You know, maybe this is your karma,

the universetrying to tell you

to stop being so stupid...

You know, if you guyswere
such close friends,

maybe it's trying to giveyour friendship

a second chance.

You're right.

That's exactly what it's doing.

Yeah.

It's giving us a second chance

to prove once and for all...

who is the winnerand who is the loser.

There will beno second place this time.

Just first placeand last place!

No motorcycle this time,

we are playing

for best decorated houseon the street!

Fate has smiled upon me today,

and I am ready to bring it on.

This means war.

Exactly where are you going?

I'm going to gobuy me a Santa!

â™ª On the first dayof Christmas â™ª

â™ª My true love gave to me

â™ª A Santa Claus on the roof

Hi.

Hi.

You just moved intothe Roberts' place,

didn't you?

Yeah.

I'm Susie.

I'm Chip.

What school do you go to?

Uh, Lincoln High or something.

Where do you go?

Lincoln.

What grade are you in?

Ninth.

Me too!

Why weren't you in school today?

My dad said there
wasn'tany point in starting

till after the Christmas break.

â™ª Up on the rooftop

â™ª Reindeer pause

â™ª Out popsgood old Santa Claus â™ª

â™ª Down through the chimney

â™ª With lots of toys

â™ª All for the little
ones, Christmas joys... â™ª

â™ª Ho, ho, ho

â™ª Who wouldn't go?

â™ª Ah, ho, ho, howho wouldn't go... â™ª

Whoa.

â™ª Ho, ho, hoOh, who wouldn't go? â™ª

â™ª Ho, ho, hoWho wouldn't go? â™ª

â™ª Up on the housetopClick, click, click â™ª

â™ª Down through the
chimneyWith good St. Nick â™ª

Did you seewhat he did?

What who did?

Stu Jones, that's who!

He put a Santa Clauson his roof!

Well, you put a Santaon our roof.

Exactly!

Just because I put a Santa Clauson our roof

does not mean that he canput
a Santa Claus on his roof!

Well, it doesn't meanhe can't either.

He put upall eight reindeer.

We had Santa first!

Well, who's got more lights?

I don't know!

Well, you need to go count.

That's the only wayyou're going to know

who's winningthis thing.

That's a good idea.

Mm-hm.

Wait a minute.

I'm not going to countall the light bulbs.

Well, why not?

You're counting all the
Santasand all the reindeer.

Timmy!

Whose side are you on, anyway?!

See, they've decoratedmost
of the obvious spots...

The roof line, trees,

some cheesy carolers.

Yeah, they still havethis yard area

and the driveway edgeto work with.

We, on the other hand,

have numerouspossibilities.

Give it a break, Stu.

Why?

Bob Wallace nevergave me a break.

He stolemy customers!

He's not a nice man, you mark my words!

His daughter seems okay.

You know his daughter?

I met her in the park.

Well, stay away from her.

His whole family are
probablyconniving cheats.

No.

Bob, we don't haveany more money

in the budgetfor decorations.

I'll usemy beer money.

Well, whatdo you think

is sittingin the fridge?

Well, then, I'll borrow something

from the Christmasparty fund.

You try that,

you'll bespending Christmas

with the birthday boyhimself.

All right, well, consider
thismy Christmas present, okay?

Those wise menlook good.

Ah, they're onlytwo feet tall.

I want somethingbig, flashy.

Well, they light up.

Ah, I wantsomething that spins

or flies, you know?

Maybe like a laser light showkind of thing.

Don't churches havegood
Christmas decorations?

Church supply company,

that is a great idea.

Hey, hey, hey, wrong house.

Que?

Yeah, yeah.

That's the wrong house.

That's my orderthere, okay?

This doesn't goto this house.

This goesto that house, okay?

Everything... everything there.

Que?

No.Aqui.

No, no, no, noaqui.There.

Is there a problem?

Yeah, there'sa problem.

This is my order,

and I want it putover at my house.

The waybill saysthis house.

Well, I don't carewhat the waybill says.

I paid for it. It's my order.

I would like to take
itover to my house, okay?

Hey, buddy!

I paid for it!- Hey, hey, hey!

It's my order, all
right?- That's my Joseph!

You're stealingmy Joseph!

Give me backmy Joseph!

It's my Joseph!

It's mine! Get your hands off it!

Stop it!

There's two orders,

two Josephs.

You both orderedthe same thing.

Then I don't want him. You can have him.

I don't want him either.

You can take my wholenativity scene back!

And mine too! Take it all away.

Credit me for what it cost.

Yes, you readthe order!

I know what it says!

Uh...

No returns?

Uh, excuse me, no refunds?

Refunds?

I... oh my!

So, when do you think

they're going toget over all this?

Who knows?

They haven't for25 years, apparently.

Well, it's not going to ruinmy Christmas.

Me either.

Welcome to the neighborhood.

Thank you. Merry Christmas.

You too.

Yeah.

They look pretty, don't they?

What?

The new nativity scenesthey've got.

They're exactly the same.

Do you reallynot like Christmas?

Who said I don'tlike Christmas?

Well, you're alwaysso gruff about it.

I just don't likeflashy Christmases.

I like Christmasthe way it used to be,

when it meantsomething,

with carols,

and the Christmas pageantat the church,

that kind of thing.

Well, the churchhas its pageant every year,

and the carol services.

I don't likefront lawns

that are so clutteredwith decorations

the grass can't grow,

and the lights on the housesare so bright,

it's like a football game.

I've got lights.

Y-yes,

but not a lot.

Come on, Lola.

It's timefor your dinner.

Good night.

Good night.

I think there'sa little Christmas romance

brewing on Honeyview Lane.

You know that old guywho's
been walking his dog

around herein the evenings?

Have you ever noticedthat Mrs. McKane

just happens to be outsidedoing something

every timehe walks by?

You're imagining things.

They're too old. She's got to be 80.

Only on the outside.

On the inside,

the woman is a girl of 18,

and every girl of 18

needs a little romancein her life.

Well, maybe,

but not withthat old Grinch.

I think he likes her,

and he's justtoo shy to say so.

Hey, did you seethis letter

Timmy wrote to Santa?

Yeah, "Dear Santa",

"I want a bike.

"Just a bike,

"a bike I'm nottoo big for.

"Only a bike,

"nothing elseexcept a bike,

"and if you can't get me that,

I'd really likea bike."

"A bike!" Yeah.

I was thinking,

we shouldget him a bike.

Yeah.

Yeah. Do you thinkwe can afford it?

If you stop buyingChristmas decorations

we don't need.

Do you think he actuallystill
believes in Santa?

Yeah, I think he does, a little bit.

Maybe we shouldget him the bike

and have Santa get himsomething else.

Yeah...

Hey, where's myChristmas party list?

I'm going to invite him.

Who?

The old guy that Mrs. McKanehas her eye on.

Oh.

I thought you were talkingabout Stu Jones.

Ah, thank you!

I'll talk to Mary tomorrow.

Over my dead body!

Do not tempt me.

They're our neighbors.

I will invite them, you will act nice.

That man is not setting footin my house!

If he's half as stubbornas
you are, my sweet,

he's not coming anyway.

Ta-da!

Hi.

Hi.

You've got your hoop up.

Yeah,

and, no, my dad put upthe
Christmas decorations.

It looks nice anyway.

You want to playsome one-on-one?

Uh, I've gota report due tomorrow.

Sorry.

It's okay.

So, uh,

what were you talking about

with that girlfrom across the street?

Susie?

Susie!

Susie, right...

Yeah, the, uh... enemy

from across the street.

We were just talking.

She said hi.

"She said hi."

Yeah, I'm sureit was just "hi,"

or was it,

"What other decorationsare
you planning to use?"

No.

That's becauseSusie's slick.

She's layingthe groundwork.

Don't you see?

Before you knowwhat's happened...

Boom!

You're spilling your guts, hmm?

Oh, for heaven's sake.

Please tell meyou are not suggesting

that Bob Wallace woulduse his daughter

to spy on you

and your stupid contest?

Yeah!

And don't eventhink about using Chip

that way either, Stu Jones.

Go.

I'm ashamed of you.

Hmm.

I can't believeyou want me to spy on them,

our own neighbors!

I'm not asking youto spy on anybody!

I'm saying,

if you're talkingwith the son,

and he happensto mention something

about their plans, you know, like,

"I just got back from
shoppingfor angels with my dad,"

or, "Sorry, I can't shoot hoop",

I'm helping my dadput
reindeer on the roof,"

you mightmention it to me.

What... hey!

Just a thought.

Pumpkin?

Stu, what's in the bags?

Lights?

And decorations.

I'm going to doubleeverything we've got,

then I've reallygot him.

Bob?

I thought you promised Mindy

you weren't going to
buyany more decorations.

Uh, yeah, that... that's true, I did,

b-but I didn't buy these.

Uh, you know Bill Painterdown
at Bill's drug store?

I gave his whole familynew glasses.

So, I... I traded them.

Pfft.

What are you hiding?

Stu?

Hmm?

What are you doing?

He's got something.

He's hiding it in the garage,
but he's got something.

And how doyou know that?

Because I saw himback
his SUV up to the garage,

and lift something out of it.

He never backs up.

Why elsewould he do that

if he wasn'thiding something?

Maybe it's too heavy, and
he can't carry it far?

It could be anything.

I mean, does it notcross your sick mind

that maybeyour competition with him

is not be the only thinghe thinks about?

Mm.

Uh, doorbell, Stu.

Stu? Stu.

Oh, hello.

Sir.

I'm the fire marshal.

We gotan anonymous call

there may be somesafety concerns

at these premises.

I'm here to do an
electricalsafety inspection

to assure the safetyand well-being

of both your familyand your neighbors.

You got more thantwo decorative light cords

plugged together here.

AFC code 176 clearly states

not to plug more thantwo
light cords together,

and code 176 is plainly
labeledon this safety tag.

Well, I... I figuredif any problem occurred,

it'd throw my breaker,

so it didn't really...

Sir, the code is the code.

Yeah, I know...

The code is the code.

Those decorationshave to go, sir.

What?! Why?

Well, that limb does not
havethe structural integrity

to support those decorations.

If it were to break due to wind

or an accumulationof snow or ice,

it would cause extreme
tensionon those wires,

possibly causingan electrical shortage.

Snow or ice?

Come on, this is California.

It hasn't snowed here since,

well, the ice age.

It snowed in Malibutwo years ago,

and the weather forecastis calling for

below averagetemperatures

with a chance for showersthis Christmas.

There might even bea frost warning.

That's a bad mixfor that limb,

and those decorations.

Oh, come on...

And I've noticed lightsplugged
together in parallel

when they should be in sequence.

80 amps of power being drawn

on 40 ampextension cords?

The list goes on.

The bottom line is, sir...

Way too many lightsand not enough juice.

You've got to cut it downby half.

Oh, please, don't...

I'll expect this situationto be corrected

by the time I returnfor re-inspection.

When will that be?

Tomorrow.

By then I expectthis
situation to be corrected

and s-a-f-e, safe.

Yes...

Sometimesl amaze myself.

Why's that, Pumpkin?

Nothing.

Nothing.

I'm going to get the, uh...

Sir, I'm the fire marshal.

We've had an anonymous tip.

I'm here to perform

an electricalsafety inspection

to ensure the safetyand well-being

of both your familyand your neighbors.

If you just come outwith me, sir,

I'll show youa few infractions here.

A key...

Uh...

Hey...

Mrs. McKane, hi.

Oh, well... I'm, uh...

I'm just borrowing some
toolsthat I loaned to Bob.

You know.

That time of the season.

Puttin' updecorations...

Merry Christmas.

Oh!

Honey, I'll be right there.

â™ª Dashing through the snow

â™ª In a one-horse open sleigh

â™ª Over the fields we go...

Mrs. McKane, would you like something?

Thank you.

Hello! How are you?

Hi!

Merry Christmas.

Oh, thanks so much. Come on in.

Hey, good to see you.

Merry Christmas.

Come on in.

I'm pretty sureyou know everybody here.

Hi.

Oh, Mr. Sutton!

I am so gladyou could make it.

Have you metmy husband, Bob?

Bob, this isMr. Sutton.

Hi.

Hi, a-and it's Earl.

Well, merry Christmas,
Earl, thanks for coming.

Oh, thank youvery much.

Come on in, Earl.

I'm sure there's somebodyyou know here.

Hello. Merry Christmas.

Walter's here!

Let the festivities begin!

Oh! Oh, look. Ooh!

Our first mistletoe kissof the year!

Okay!

Where's the food?

Mrs. McKane, have you met Earl Sutton?

Well, we've said hello,

but we've never beenproperly introduced.

He tried to poison me.

Who?

Bob Wallace's son, that's who!

He tried to poison mewith that dip!

Oh, my goodness.

Did you eat my dip?

It is extremely hot.

You know, I would loveto
tone it down a little,

but Walterloves it that way.

There, now, do you see?

It should comewith an FDA warning on it...

"hazardous to humans."

That is so rude.

That's good...

Okay, everybody.

Hello? Everybody?

Quiet!

Huh. Thank you, Walter.

It's the moment

you've allbeen waiting for.

It is time for "the Christmas game show..."

with your host, Santy Claus!

What is this?

Well, every year, Bob puts on a game show.

Don't worry, it's a lot of fun.

Okay, Mindy, who's going to be Elfee?

Come on, somebody'sgot to be Elfee...

Who's Elfee?

I'll do it.

You were Elfee last year.

You can't do ittwo years in a row.

Then I volunteerour new neighbor Stu Jones!

Oh, uh, no...

Please, I... I...

I'd really rather not.

Aw, Santa,

Stu Jones has beengraciously volunteered

to be ourscorekeeper, Santa.

Okay...

Well, why don't you follow Mindy,

and she willset you up.

Elfee's alwayson the Donner team.

What teamis Santa on?

Santa's noton a team.

No, he makes upthe questions,

so that wouldn't be fair, right?

Come on, let's go.

Okay, so let's putthe Blitzens on the left,

and the Donnerson the right.

Oh, Mary, sincehusbands and wives

can't be on the same team,

you're going to bea Blitzen.

A Blitzen.

Uh, Helen, you be a Donner...

There you go, let's have some arms.

Come on.

Mom, we're out of root beer.

Oh, there's somein the garage, sweetie.

Where's the key?

Your dad must have it.

He's in the living room.

Need a hand?

Dad...

Your father has agreed

in our littleChristmas game.

We're out of root beer,

but there might besome in the garage.

Okay, that's it.

Let's not keepSanta waiting.

Oh, ho!

Okay...

Elfee, your job

is to screw in one of
these Christmas lights

every time one of the
teamsgets an answer right.

Do you think you can handle that?

Don't worry about me.

Okay.

All right, we will
startwith the Donner team.

Now, you're going topick a category.

We have "Wassailing"or "Silent Night".

Santa, we will take Wassailing.

Wassailing, okay, and this category

is about Christmas carols.

So, "What was the gift"

on the ninth day of Christmas?"

Okay.

â™ª On the twelfthday of Christmas â™ª

â™ª My true love gave to me

â™ª Twelve drummersdrumming â™ª

â™ª Eleven...

I forget.

Okay, confer, confer.

We have an answer.

Okay.

"Nine lords a-leaping."

You are wrong.

All right, Blitzen team, would
you like to try to answer?

Yes, yes, yes.

I believe it's "nine ladies dancing."

You are correct! Very good.

Score up onefor the Blitzen team.

Very good.

Now, sincethe Blitzen team

got that one right,

the loser

Donner team

is going to get to pickthe category again,

so, "Wassailing"or "Silent Night"?

Mm, Silent Night.

Silent Night, okay.

Now, this isthe charade category.

So, who's going to act it out?

I'd like to see Stugive it a shot.

Please do not volunteer
mefor anything else, okay?

Yeah, let's seewhat you got, Elfee.

Elfee! Elfee!

Elfee! Elfee! Elfee!

Elfee! Elfee! Elfee!

All right! All right, all right.

Ready?

Go.

Song!- No, book!

Movie!

It's a movie, people.

Come on, Elfee, don't be testy.

Um...

One.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, "It's a Wonderful Life".

Yes!

One word.

The movie title is one word.

Uh...

Hmm?

Hey, whatare you doing?

Angry elf!

Hey, you have tostop talking,

Mr. Blitzen.

Get off the elfanswers, people.

My costume has nothingto do with the movie.

As far as I know, there
were no elves in it.

Santa, I don't thinkhe should be talking.

Yes, she's right.

Elfee, stop talking.

Um... Okay.

Okay.

Ave Maria!

Ave Maria!

â™ª Ave Maria...

Okay, okay, you know...

That does it.

I give up.

It's a stupid game.

Well, I'm sorry.

It was designedfor adults.

I would havemade it easier

if I'd known you weregoing to play.

Ooh...

All right, all right,

that does it.

Okay, y-you've all seenboth houses.

Who has the betterdecorations, hmm?

What?

They're aboutthe same.

The nativity scenesare exactly the same.

I have a better Santa.

Well, you don't have a sign.

I have a sign.

I have better carol singers.

I have colored lights.

I don't like colored lights.

I don't care what you like.- What?

Boys, please. Play nice.

It doesn't matterwho's best.

They're bothbeautiful.

Play the game.

Yes, well, your time has expired.

Okay, so, Blitzen,

you can't act it out,

but you can takea guess.

Eh...

Is it The Nutcracker?

Yes, that's right!

Score up another one

for Blitzen team,

and it wasn't a movie,

it was a ballet.

They made a movie of it.

My mother watched itevery Christmas.

Oh, happy ho-ho,

and as always, great party.

Thanks so much forinviting us, Bob.

It would not beour Christmas party

without you guys.

â™ª Ave, Maria...

Say, Bob,

plan on setting upthe same decorations?

Drop it, Walter.

Merry Christmas, Bob!

All right.

â™ª We wish youa merry Christmas! â™ª

â™ª We wish youa merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish youa merry Christmas... â™ª

Oh, um, I'm just goingto

Good night, guys.

Good night.

What did I tell you?

Very cute.

Oh, yeah.

It was a niceevening, wasn't it?

Yes, it was.

And it was very nice

to finally meet youproperly, Earl.

Would you like to cometo
the Christmas pageant

at St. Michael'swith me?

Why, I'd like that very much.

Oh, good.

Well, I... I'd betterget back to Lola.

Okay.

Good night.

Good night.

Earl?

There's somethingl should tell you.

I may be leaving soon.

Moving.

Where would you go?

Well, it's a long story,

complicated.

Do you have family to go tofor Christmas?

Well, my son's in Germany,
and my daughter's in Japan,

so either way,

it's too far to goto eat a turkey.

Well, I... I havemy Christmas dinner

at the Wallaces'.

Uh-huh.

This year Mindy asked meif
I'd like to bring someone.

Would you like to come?

That would be very nice.

Good.

Then I'll tell heryou're coming.

And I won't change your mind

about not likingflashy Christmases.

Oh, I didn't think you would.

So I can be my grinchy self?

No!

You're getting

a traditionally big familyChristmas dinner

like the old days.

There's nothingto be grinchy about.

What if I can'tcontrol myself?

Then consider yourselfuninvited

until you're sure you can.

Well, fine.

Okay, that'sgood enough.

We can get the restin the morning.

What are you doing?

I'm waiting for Stuto turn his lights out.

Oh, for pity's sake!

Come to bed.

Whatever.

Score another pointfor team Jones, Elfee.

Susie!

What are you doing down there?

Nothing.

I just wanted to talk to you.

You havenice friends.

Thank you.

I had fun tonight.

So did I.

What are you doing tomorrow?

Uh, I don't know.

I've got stuff with my momin the morning,

but I'm freeafter that.

Want to get together?

Okay.

Um, why don't you come byabout 2:00?

Why don't we meetup the road?

Just in case...

You know, this whole
thingbetween our fathers.

Yeah, good idea.

Okay,

I'll see you at 2:00.

Well, good night.

Good night.

What the heck?

You're Susie's littlebrother, aren't you?

Who I am is a secret.

All you need to know

is that if we can'tmake a deal,

I'm gonna tell your dadabout you and Susie.

What kind of arrangement?

What kind of decorations

is your dad still planningto put out?

I don't knowanything about that.

Okay,

then we'll just have to see

what your daddy thinks

about your late-night visitto our house.

If he had something, I'd tell you...

Not becauseyou're blackmailing me,

you little doofus.

I'd tell you

because this wholething is stupid,

and I'm fed up with it,

but he doesn't have anything, not a thing.

Nothing, huh?

Perfect.

Your mission, Stuart Jones,
should you decide to accept it,

is to find outwhat Bob Wallace has hidden

underneath that tarpin the garage.

This is cool...

I gotta take a picture.

Smile and say cheese.

Cheese.

Oh!

Ooh...

Oh boy.

I'll fix it tomorrow.

Oh, yeah...

Where are you going,

and why are youdressed like that?

I'm... Just doing a little...

Research?

Where?

I'm just, uh,

going to takea little peek

in...

Bob's garage.

You are going to dono such thing.

I've got to find outwhat
he's got hidden there!

No, you don't.

Yes, I do!

Um...

If you get arrested,

don't you useyour phone call

asking meto bail you out.

Don't.

I mean it.

Aah!

Bob!

Did you bringKitty in?

Hmm? Uh, Tim.

Tim put her in the garagefor the party.

No, no, no, he didn't,

because the garage doorwas locked.

You have to go get her.

No, she'll be fine.

She's going to get eatenby coyotes.

I pity the coyote that tries.

Go. You have to go...

Ow!

Hey! Kitty!

Petal!

Go, you dumb cat, go on!

Great, now you're beating
upHelen's little tomcat.

I'll never hearthe end of that.

This is whyl'm not a cat person.

Oh, my...

Kitty! Petal!

Petal, I got dinner. Come here.

Ah, there you are.

Hey...

Come here, hey.

What does tonight's victimlook like, huh?

You pleading the fifth?

All right, you have got to stop

bullying the dumband the defenseless.

Yeah. Okay...

Here you go.

Why can't you do thatwhen
you're outside all day?

Hmm...

Tomcat, is that you?

Is that you, Tomcat?

Go on home, go on,

and no snitching to Helen,

or I'll let Petal out againtomorrow night.

Huh?

A bike?

So, what wasBob's big secret?

A bike.

Oh, a bike.

A bike!

He's got nothing.

Neither do you.

Don't you dare step one footinside my house

with that stuff on you.

But I...

Use a hose.

He has nothing.

Absolutely nothing?

Nada.Zero.

Nothing.

How do you know?

I cannotreveal my source.

But you're sure?

Sure of what?

Nothing.

I heard you.

What nothing?

Nothing nothing.

Okay.

You,

stay out of thisstupid competition

your father haswith Mr. Jones,

and you,

don't you dare

get him involved.

He's too young,

and you're old enoughto know better.

Now, you heardeveryone last night.

You've got the same.

It's a dead heat.

There's no winner, no loser,

so just quit

while you're even!

She's right.

We're even,

we're level, exactly the same,

so that means

we only need to getone more

big, totally awesomedecoration...

then I got him.

I've got himgood and beat.

You know howeveryone will know

I got him goodand beat?

No.

It's perfect!

We'll havean official judge,

the mayor.

He will decide.

Then the entire townwill see who's the man,

and who's the loser.

And just whatbrilliant decoration

are you going tocome up with

to pull this one off?

I'll find something, my sweet.

Trust me.

That's good.

Hey, hey!

You haven't addedanything, have you?

I'm changing the light bulb.

Have you seen this?

Yeah, I'veseen it, Stu.

Have you entered?

I enter every year.

Well, I'm entering today.

Come Wednesdaywhen he
judges our decorations,

the mayor is going toembarrass you

in front of the entire town.

Well, the way I see it,

you are the one who's
going tobe red in the face,

and frankly, that'll be an improvement.

Well, if you're so confident,

why don't we puta little wager on it?

Say 50 bucks?

50 bucks?

Why don't we just betbottle
caps, you cheapskate?

You got a better wager?

Yeah,

$100.

Oh, I see,

50's too small,

but 100, that'sa real man's bet?

It's better than 50,

but if you want to
gohigher, I'll go higher.

Yeah, yeah, I want to go higher.

Well, fine! How about a thousand?

Fine with me.

You sure you can afford it?

Oh, I can afford it, and then some.

Really? Then how about $2,000?

T-two...

Are you kidding?

Too much for you?

You haven't got the
gutsfor a real bet, huh?

No, I have gotthe guts!

How about $5,000, huh?

Have you got the guts for that?

I would love to bet 5,000.

Well, then, you're on!

$5,000!

In cash.

You bet what?

Are you insane!

I mean, what withmoving here

and you starting upa new practice,

we don't have $5,000!

Honey...

Don't worry.

I'm going to win!

Hi.

Sorry I'm late.

It's okay. I just got here.

My dad, all he cares about

is this stupiddecorating contest.

Did you hear aboutthis bet thing?

Yeah, my mom wasgoing crazy about it.

I thought she was going tokill my dad.

He's acting like a total dweeb.

Mine too.

Both our dads are.

Anyway...

So, what shall we do?

You want to go see a movie?

There's nothing I want to see.

Have you beento the mall yet?

We could go there.

I'm not big ongoing to the mall.

Me neither.

We could go skating.

Hey, dude, welcome to California.

We don't have ice rinks here.

Well, we dosome places,

but not in Richmond.

You want to go bowling?

Yeah. Great.

Cool.

Would you acceptthis peace offering?

Oh, yes, that's so nice of you.

Come in.

No, actually, I...

It's okay,

Bob's not here.

Oh.

These look great.

Thank you, yes.

Did you make themyourself?

Of course.

Ooh..

Hey, can I get youa coffee,

or a sodaor something like that?

Do you haveanything diet?

I... have O.J.

No, no, just water, thank you.

Okay, sure.

Listen, I, um...

I would like to talk to you

about this bet our
husbandsmade this morning...

Oh, please, say no more.

Nobody is payinganybody $5,000

because of somestupid contest they have.

I'm so relieved, thank you,

and I agreewith you completely.

No, thank you.

How on earth they ever

let it get this far

is just beyond me.

Oh, I know.

It ruined their
friendshiplike, 25 years ago.

There's no reason it
shouldruin their lives now.

Yes...

Oh!

Oh, these are amazing!

Yes.

I, uh, I gratethe cinnamon myself,

and then I add a little tiny
bitof organic chopped pecans.

Wow.

I do think, you know,

when they met againafter all these years,

it was an opportunityfor them

to patch things up, you know?

Not just pick up the
fightwhere they left off.

Yeah, see, that's wherel blame myself.

I mean...

Why?

Because when Bobput the
Santa Claus on the roof,

I should never have let
Stuput up a bigger one.

Oh, you know what,

it's completely my fault.

Yeah, it is.

When you guys moved in,

and you put upyour Christmas decorations

on the very same day,

there is no way I should
have let Bob go ahead

and put upmore lights.

Are you... are you saying it's my fault

because I let Stu putour decorations up

the day we moved in?

No, no, of course not.

Oh, good.

No...

But, you know, I... I wonder,

if you guys had waited just...

just a couple of days,

and maybe shown a littlemore consideration

for what was normalon Honeyview Lane,

then, I don't know,

maybe this whole
thingwouldn't have happened.

So then you are blaming me.

No, no, I'm notblaming anyone.

I just think it's bestto tread lightly

when you move intoa new neighborhood,

and just getthe lay of the land.

Well, I don't thinkit's very neighborly

to start a competitionwith
your new neighbors

the very day they move in.

Are you sayingthat I wasn't neighborly?

Well, you're sayingl wasn't considerate.

Well, you weren't!

Oh, and you knowsomething?

You were not neighborly!

W-well...

Well, fine. Here, take this dish, too.

I certainly will,

and I'll be sureto disinfect it

after it's been insidethis... this...
pigsty!

Oh, well, at least I'm notMrs.
OCD housewife!

You know, Stu was so right

about you,

about the whole lot of you!

Oh, and I can just imaginewhat he said,

coming froma lying cheat like him!

Stu is not a cheat!- He is so!

This whole thing startedbecause he cheated!

All right, that's it, the bet is on!

The bet is on!

$5,000 cash!

Yeah, and you know something?

Stu and I will beat you,

and we'll beat youthe way we do everything,

fair and square.

Oh, well, "fair and square,"

and you know what,

I think chopped pecansin
ginger cookies is just dumb!

I had fun.

So did I.

I hadn't gone bowlingfor ages.

You were awesome.

I was lucky.

My dad saysit takes talent and luck

to be good at anything.

I wonder what our dads

have done now?

Nothing, I hope.

So, will I see you again?

We live across the street.

I mean, will I "see you" see you?

Yeah, I hope so.

When?

Tomorrow?

See you tomorrow.

How about another Santa?

Oh, no, I've seen all the Santas.

There's nothing special.

Okay, how about

some elves to go withthe
Santa that we've got?

No, it's gotto be something

totally unique.

You know, something
Stuwould never think of.

We only have three more days.

We have to think of something.

Honey, do you thinkour house is a pigsty?

What?

What?

Huh?

What are you asking me?

Do you thinkour house

is a pigsty?

No.

You just like it relaxed.

You know, lived-in.

I like that. It's good.

Okay, you.

Come here.

Mmm?

Hello...

Sweetie?

Okay, you come here.

Okay.

Okay.

Uh-huh.

Bye!

Yeah, okay...

Yes. Okay.

Yes!

Yes...

What's going on?

I've got it!

I've got it. It's perfect.
Stu will never think of it.

What is it? What? What?

You knowMaclntire's Department Store?

No, no, we're just goingChristmas shopping.

Mom... Where?

Maclntire's.

We're not goingto Maclntire's.

The auction'sat the art gallery.

I know that,

but if Stu asks Chipwhere we're going,

it'll throw himoff the track.

Right.

I thoughtyou were going out

with that Wallacegirl today.

She has to babysit her brother.

Well, that's what you get

for fraternizingwith the enemy.

Susie's not the enemy.

Did they saywhere they're going?

Christmas shopping.

Where?

Some department storecalled Maclntire's.

Don't interrogate me on this.
I don't want to be part of it.

Maclntire's?

I... I read somethingabout that.

Where'syesterday's paper?

Garage.

Ick!

Oh, my god...

Oh...

Eureka.

Maclntire'sDepartment Store.

Come on.

What?

It's my best sweater.

It's been closed since July!

Just let me see it, let me see it.

Yes, but they're stillselling off

Hey, here, here!

Hello! Hi!

Bid!

We would like tomake a bid, please,

on your Christmas angel.

I'm sorry, but bidding is over.

I'll give you $100 more

than yourhighest offer.

I'm sorry, rules are rules.

No, no, no, no such thing as rules.

If you want the angelthat badly,

you'll have to tryto get the new owner

to sell it to you.

Oh, please don't tell meit's Bob Wallace.

Please don'ttell me it's Bob Wallace!

No, Mr. Wallace's bidcame in second.

Who did buy it?

An anonymous bidder.

Okay.

Okay, so what are yougoing to do now, Stu?

'Cause we don't have $5,000.

So, what are you going to do?

This is all your fault.
You know that, don't you?

And I don't just meanthis
stupid bet with Bob.

I mean this whole warwith Bob.

You cheated first.

You're the onewho stole his customers.

Well, I wantedthe red motorbike.

Yeah, well, you didn'tget it, did you?

No.

And you lostyour best friend

not winning it, didn't you?

Yeah.

Take me home.

Can I have the keys?

Well, you'd betterthink of something.

We can't affordto lose $5,000.

Another card from the Walkers.

Oh, good,

another pictureof their goofy kids.

They're not that goofy.

Bob, why are we

over $4,700 behind

in ourproperty taxes?

What?

We're not behind on our taxes.

It says right here

if we don't payimmediately,

plus the late fees,

they're going to... foreclose on our house.

Let me see that.

No, this isfor 410 Honeyview lane.

We're 408.

It's Mrs. McKane's.

Oh, no.

She hasn't paid her
taxesfor the past few years.

Oh...

She can't affordto keep her house,

and we're throwing away
moneyon more decorations

than the entire towncould use.

Plus making betswe can't afford.

Well, it's too late now.

I'll take this overin the morning.

Yeah, hello.

Hold, please.

Susie!

Susie!

It's that Jones boy!

Hi!

Sure, when?

Okay, I'll be therein a minute.

Hey, hey, whereare you going?

I'm going outsideto talk to Chip.

You just talked to himon the phone.

He wants to see me.

Poor Mrs. McKane.

Where are you going?

Bed.

I've been thinking.

In a couple of days' time,

we're going to havea winner and loser

in this wholedecorating contest thing,

and the loser'sgot to pay $5,000.

That's not exactly going
tobring our parents closer.

Do you really think our dads

are going tohold each other

to this stupid bet?

My dad would,

and your dad's going tohate me if he loses.

My dad wouldn't hate you.

He's not like that.

He hates mealready.

I'm "that Jones boy,"

and you're "that Wallace girl"

to my dad.

What am I doing?

It's never going to work.

What?

Us.

How can it?

You're breaking up with me?

I thought we liked each other.

We do.

I... I really like you.

It's just...

It's impossibleenough now

with our dadshating each other,

and when one of themwins the bet

and the other one loses,

it's going toget worse.

This is the worstChristmas ever.

I hate you.

She's right.

This is the worstChristmas ever.

We've got to callthe bet off.

What?

Stu, one of us winning,
one of us losing tomorrow

is not going to bethe end of this.

It's just going to bethe beginning.

We're destroyingChristmas!

My daughterhates me now.

Before you know it, your
son is going to hate you.

Then our wives are going tohate both of us.

Where's it going to end?

You know what'sterrible?

25 years ago,

we threw awaythe best friendship

that two guys could have,

and now,

when we get a chanceto make it right,

we don't seize it, we're
just making it worse!

We've got to changewhile we can.

You're right.

We're idiots.

I'm sorry.

So am I.

I'm so glad to have youback
in my life, my friend.

Me too.

So, I've gota proposition for you.

Our neighbor, Mrs. McKane,

she's going to lose her house

'cause she can't affordto pay her taxes.

So I was thinking,

we could take halfof that money

that we were going to bet

and... and we could help her out.

Bob, I... I don't evenhave $2,500.

The only way I wasgoing
to get $5,000 was...

was if I won.

Well, then, you know something?

I got a better idea.

Hello, Mrs. McKane, merry Christmas!

Oh, my goodness!

What can I do for you all?

We're here todecorate your house.

That's right!

How about it, huh?

Really?

It... it's going to rain.

We have to get itdone by tonight.

Oh, that's a wonderful idea!

Oh, merry Christmas!

So, Earl,

what do you think of my
Christmas decorations now?

Too flashy for you, I suppose?

I think they look wonderful.

It could useone finishing touch, though.

Set it up right there, guys.

It'll look great there.

I figuredyour Christmas

I was going to give itto you Christmas Eve,

but then I figured

the Christmas
