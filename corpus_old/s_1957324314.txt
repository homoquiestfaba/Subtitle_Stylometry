[cell phone rings]

Cruz, where are ya?

Sir, I think
we're about to find

this rotating brothel
we're looking for.

Well, you better damn
well be right this time.

We just found our fourth victim.

[grunts] Same pattern.
[flies buzzing]

Scalp torn off her head.

About 70% of her skin missing

and whitish patches
on the rest of her body.

It's him again.

The Cradle.

Yeah, another hooker.

Same tattoo.

These girls were branded
by the same employer.

And this man doesn't work alone.

We need to dig deeper.

I think he's got a
pimp helping him.

Be alert.

This maniac is capable
of inflicting real pain.

Send me the location.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[door opens and shuts]

Dude, you look like crap.

This is it.

[siren wails]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

TONY: Let's check our cameras.
ROCCO: Yeah.

[siren wails]

Remember, look for an
albino woman when we find him.

Got it.

BOUNCER: Get inside.

Good evening, gentlemen,
and welcome to The Silk Club.

May your wildest and
most erotic dreams come true.

â™ª I could've called her lucky,

â™ª She already know â™ª

[indistinct chatter]

Hi.

You see the main
desk over there?

Go pay my fees, and
they'll give you a red coin.

Bring it back to me,

and I'll take you inside
for 15-minute ride.

[air kiss]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

How old are you?

Why do you ask?

Are you in love with me?

You should get out of here.

Let me go!

ROCCO: Tony, come on, man.

You better control
your looney friend.

I'm gonna take a look around.

â™ª Yeah â™ª

â™ª I could've called her lucky,
she already know â™ª

â™ª She already know â™ª

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[indistinct chatter]

FBI! Don't move!

Put your hands
above your head now!


[indistinct chatter]

Let the girl go.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You're under arrest.

Freeze, don't move.

Yeah, I need you to dispatch
backup at 3955 East 5th Street.

TONY: With your right hand,
take off your sunglasses. Now!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

TONY: Make it slow.

[indistinct chatter]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]





ROCCO: Tony!


ROCCO: Tony!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]





[grunts, yells]

What is happening to this man?

[indistinct radio chatter]

JOHNNY: Tony!

Hey
Hey.

Just give me one second.

Tony! What's up?
It's good to see you, man.

Look at you.
You look great, you look great.

Come on in.
Everyone's here.

Hi, Johnny.
Hey, man, so where you been?

At some Buddhist
retreat or something?

Nah, seriously, man,
it's been, like,

10 months since
you've left the Bureau.

What's going on?

I didn't leave.
They let me go.

Eh, whatever.
Did you find another job?

I'm not in a rush.
Ah! Why would you be?

Hey, man, come here,
let me get you a drink.

Now, I have to apologize, right?

My girl forgot beer,
so we're all stuck drowning

in this pink invention of hers.

It's her birthday, so you
can't really complain, right?


Johnny, you shouldn't be
talking about my cocktail

behind my back.
Sweetie!

How was it that you could be

having a conversation
with your friends

and still be listening
to what we're saying?

Let me rephrase:
this is delicious.

Mmm.

Meet Doris.
This is my birthday girl.

Now be careful,
she's a psychiatrist,

so she's probably
checking you out as we speak.

Hello, Tony.

Oh, so you guys
know each other?

Dr. Doris Baxter.

Turn it on, turn it off.

What is this turn it on,
turn it off thing

you guys are talking about?
MAN: Hey, Johnny!

Oh, beer.
Beer is here!

All right, guys, listen.
You guys... and hey, be careful.

This is the woman I love.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

So, two sessions...

and you never came back.
Why?

Let's say... I went
down to Machu Picchu.

I hope you found the
peace you were looking for.

I think so.
I lost a lot of money trying.

Oh, I'm glad.

About what?
That I lost my money?

I'm happy for you.
I... I was concerned.

I... I thought for sure
you had this certain...

I'm totally recovered.

I'm moving on with my life.

Look at me. I'm here.

RITA: Doris, I need to leave!

Stay... stay till
we cut the cake.

One second.

[indistinct chatter]

Hey, everybody, come on.

Let's gather around and sing
happy birthday to my woman.

Come on!

GUESTS: â™ª Happy
birthday to you â™ª

[sinister music]

â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

[singing warps, distorts]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


RITA: Doris?!
What is it?

RITA: Look at him.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

DORIS: They've checked
every part of your brain.

The protein markers for

the three most
prevalent brain cancers

turned up negative.

Blood thymine level was normal.

And there are no signs
of tumor on the CAT scan.

The test results
were conclusive.

They can't help you
with your problem, Tony.

But... I can.

You have a psychological
disorder called nyctophobia.

It's a fear of the dark.

It's a part of a
generalized anxiety disorder,

and it is more common in
children, rarely in adults.

Do you often have
heart palpitations

and excessive sweating

and... breathlessness?

Maybe even... the
fear that you're dying?

This is serious, Tony.

You are a highly decorated
FBI agent

and you had a
full-blown anxiety attack.

Have you had these
symptoms before?

Who's this?

That's my father.

Answer the questions, Tony.

We had something
similar at my mom's house.

That was a long time ago.

[sweet, peaceful music]

Okay, Tony.
It's your turn.

Tell me the name and the
meaning of those flowers.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Tony, what's wrong?

Tony, don't be silent.

Silence is a box
we need to open.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ANA: Daisies.
It means loyal love.

THERESA: Yes.

Mom, your name
should be Daisy.

THERESA: [chuckles]

[sinister music]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Whoa.

I keep telling you,
I don't care...

Mo... Mom?

I didn't say that.
It's none of my business.

Nothing to worry about.

Don't ever show people
that you're afraid.

Look, I have a little
trick when I feel scared.

I whistle a nice melody
and my fears go away.

You wanna hear it?

[whistles a tune]

[joins in]

[blows air]

But Mom, Tony can't whistle.

Oh, well, come here, young man.
We gotta fix that.

Come down here.

We are gonna make an ocarina
with your hands, okay?

So, chop your left hand
with your right hand

right where your fingers
meet the palm... hiyah!


See, this is a bird trap.

Now, you leave a hole open
for the birdy can breathe.

And then you put your lips
to the knuckles of your thumb

and you blow into the hole.

[blows air]

No, no, no, not so
hard, not so hard.

[giggles]
It's not a trumpet.

Try it again.


With a little
practice, you'll get it.

Let's play hide-and-seek!

Ah!
[speaks Spanish]

Ten...

nine...

eight...

seven...

six...

five...

Don't hide under the
floor like you always do!

Four...

...three...

...two...

...one!

Tony?


[knocking at door]

Hi.
Good afternoon, ma'am.

It's my car.
Such an old model.

I think it ran out
of water again.

I'm wondering if
you could help me out.

Oh yeah, yeah, don't worry.

I'll, uh... I'll
bring a container.

You can fill it with our hose.
Thank you.

[sinister music]

So this is... this is the only
thing I could really find.

It's so cozy in here.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I love your daughter's skin.

What did you just say?

[grunts]
Oh!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

THERESA: [pants, whimpers]

Where is she?!

THERESA: [whimpers]

THE CRADLE: Where is she?!


[window opens]
[gasps]

I knew it!

I knew you were in here.
Shh, shh, shh.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

THERESA: [yells, pants]

[punching]
[grunts]

Let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!

Man of the house.

Help! My mom!



If you don't tell me
where your sister is

by the time
this alarm goes off...

[clock ticking]

...I'm gonna let
the judges' panel

take care of the situation.

Let me introduce them to you.

[muffled screams]

THE CRADLE: This
is a blind judge.

This is the indolent man.

And this?

This one's the ugly judge.

Now, if you don't answer me...

the indolent man
will turn the other way.

And the ugly judge
will ask me

to rip open your
mother's stomach!

Talk!

Let me go! Mama!

THE CRADLE: Where
is your sister?!

Let me go!

THE CRADLE: Where is she?!

Where is your sister?

YOUNG TONY: No!

Where is your sister?


YOUNG TONY: Let me go!
Let me go!

You'll die if
you don't tell me.

No, no!


What are you looking at?

Stay here!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

THE CRADLE:
Where... where are you?!

[glass shattering]


ANA: No, no, no, no!

THERESA: No!

[metallic slicing]
THE CRADLE: [yells]

THERESA:
[screams frantically]

[footsteps]
[door opens and shuts]

Mama!
Mama, is that you?

[speaks Spanish]

ADULT TONY: I stayed hidden
like a weakling

in that dark hole.

No air except for that crack.

It smelled like sewage
or something rotten.

YOUNG TONY: [yells]

DORIS: How long
were you in there?

Three days.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[door creaks open]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Let's get out of here.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ADULT TONY: I was
sent back to Venezuela

to be raised by my aunt.

I couldn't stand being in
the dark for several years.






[starts to cry]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ADULT TONY: I finally
got over my fear.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ADULT TONY:
Until I saw the same man

in... in the brothel that night.

It happened again.

Did they ever
find your sister?


It was my fault.

No, Tony.

I left the chair
under the attic.

That's how he found her.

Don't you see?

No.

You cannot blame yourself.

You were just a child.

Tony...

these anxiety episodes

will keep coming over
and over and over until...

Until what?

Until you realize that
it wasn't your fault.

I care for you, and I want
you to come see me again.

Okay?
[rips prescription from pad]

For now,
take this prescription.

Take as directed.

One will help you
get some sleep.

The other is a mood stabilizer.

Do not stop taking suddenly.

Call me anytime.

Rocco.

Dude, you look like crap.

Don't pity me.
I'll be back on my feet soon.

Trust me.

Take that.

I got a friend
that's gonna get you a job

at Dan Crawford's residence.

Yes, it's the Dan Crawford

you're thinking of,
the billionaire.

Look, Rocco, I
appreciate it, but no.

Tony, please, you have
got to take this job.

Look for a lead that
will get you to The Cradle.

I found a match in one
of the hookers' cell phone

back at the brothel.

It is none other than
Rebecca Crawford's number.

The old man's wife.

We can use her to find
the next rotating brothel.

We already know The Cradle
frequents these places.

If you work for them...

you could tail
her ass everywhere.

Here's a GPS tracking device.

Link this to your cell phone
and hide it in her car.

You can find her
any time you need to.

And nobody at the Bureau
knows anything about it.

[slow big band music]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[indistinct chatter]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Good evening.
Good evening.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[glass shatters]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[water rushing]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[indistinct chatter]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Wolfsbane!
[gasps]

Be careful!

I didn't mean to scare you.

That flower, it contains
alkaloid pseudaconitine,

a poison that was
used to hunt wolves.

Had I know that, I'dve
given it to my last boyfriend.

Who are you?
I'm not a party crasher.

I'm the one who
organized this party.

I just didn't want them
to see me dressed like this.

Are you a new driver?

Not exactly, but
you could say that.

You must be the event planner.

Not exactly, but
you could say that.

You have great
taste in flowers.

Plumerias, cannas,
bleeding hearts,

and white lotus on the fountain.

I guess the bees are gonna
have an orgy tomorrow.

The new chauffeur
is a botanist?

Just an amateur.

My mother was a
skilled gardener.

Hm. Well, then
surely she taught you

about an ancient legend
that says

if you close your eyes
and caress a flower's bud...

then somewhere, a girl
grows up safe and sound.

Done.

I helped a girl.

It was nice to meet you.

What was your name?
Tony.

Here's my card.
Mm.

In case you need a driver.

You should come and
see the show I planned.

It should start any time.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Shut down your mouth.

As if you had not seen another
woman so beautiful in your life.

Actually, no.

You don't know her?

It's Rebecca Crawford,
our boss's wife.

[song ends]

[crowd applause]

[gate whirring]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[tires screeching]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


â™ª Well, the sun
ain't shining â™ª

[doorbell rings]
Table for one, Dennis?

I think you're taking me
for someone else, ma'am.

Are you following
me or not, Dennis?

Jeez!

[indistinct chatter]

Kudos to the new driver.
You finally made it here.

I apologize.

Last night, I didn't know
that you were...

well, I mean, that you are...

The thing is,
I was hired two days ago

to be part of
your security staff...

Aren't private eye detectives

a little out of fashion
nowadays?

My husband hired
you to follow me,

he should provide you
a better car.

Sit down.

[jukebox music plays]

Well, look who's here!

How's life treating
you, buddy girl, huh?

Now, don't tell
me what you want.

A New York egg cream
is coming right away.

You're such a darling.
Make it two.

I want him to try it.
WAITER: You got it.

[cook shouts order]
[bell dings]

It's nothing against you.

I'm just allergic to bodyguards
walking in mute mode next to me.

You won't even
notice that I'm around.

Heh.

I'll tell ya what.

You keep your job by...

walking my dog and getting me
things from the grocery store.

Is that okay with you?

Yeah.

I'm thrilled by
my new assignment.

What's the name of the puppy?

Curvy. Would you
like to see a picture?

Do I need to?

They say dogs look
like their owners.

I'll take that
as a compliment.

Check it out for yourself.


My Curvy is the next
best thing to an angel.

Now that I know my new task,

I think I better
go and wait outside.

I'll escort you back home.

You don't need
to wait outside.

WAITER: Here you go!
The two absolute finest

New York egg creams
in the world.

[laughs]
Thank you, darling.

WAITER: Enjoy.


[jukebox music changes]

Sweetener.
Do you want some?

No, thanks.

Are you angry or something?

Relax!

Enjoy your drink.

Have fun at work.

Look at us, getting
to know each other.

Establishing boundaries.

Exchanging information.

You get to know your employer.

I get to know my employee.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Uh, where are the napkins?

Can you grab me a napkin
from that table, please?


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Don't forget that.

Grab one.

You seem to me like a man
who needs a bad habit.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Cheers.

WAITRESS:
This is on the house, honey.

I felt negative vibes
with your angry boyfriend.

He's a bodyguard.
He's not angry.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[jukebox music intensifies]

nothing personal.

Just tell my husband that

this is what I do to
his private detectives.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

WAITRESS: I'll leave
you guys the check.

No rush.

Are you okay, Dennis?

REBECCA: I'll take
care of it, honey.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I told you... you
needed a bad habit.

[cigarette sizzles]

[train whistle blows]

[dog barks]

[engine stops]

[siren wails]

[car horn honks]

[dog barks]

[car alarm goes off]

[motorcycle zooms]

[dog barks]

WOMAN: [crying]

MAN: You like that?

MAN: [moans]

MAN: Stop! Stop, please!

Do you want it again?
Do you?

[screams]
[smack]

WOMAN: [screams]
WOMAN: You want it again?

MAN: Yeah! hit him!
[smacking]

MAN: [laughs]

WOMAN: [moans]

Tell her to not beat my boy!

Please tell her
not to beat my boy!

[sinister music]

[slow clap]

WOMAN: [screams, cries]


Long gone are the days when you
looked like a truck stop hooker!

It's Melody herself!

Or should I call you Christa?

Or maybe Bambi?

I forget how the fuck
you like to be named.


WOMAN: [screams]

Oh, merci.

C'est bien.

I meant what I
said the other day.

I expect you to keep
your promise as well.

Where is she?
Where's my sister?

Everyone is talking word
on the street about you.

Ze renegade.

And that's solid shit for me.

Everyone is saying
you are leaving the city.

I didn't come here to
talk shop with you, Vincent.

This is just for my
sister to get out of here.

She won't be a hooker
for the rest of her life.

She's not a hooker!

She was my partner.
She has run this place with me!

What do you want for her, huh?

To be a loose bitch like you?

you're squared up, hm?

WOMAN: [screams]

You're still a bitch...

living in a gold cage.

I don't care!
We have an agreement.

She must come with me
even if she despises me!

Okay, okay, all right.

I keep my part of the deal.

[sinister music]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

VINCENT: Don't move.

He hates blondes.

He'll break your
bones like crackers.

[blows whistle]

[breathes deeply]

Okay, where is she?

Bring her now!

Your sister was sick.

Very sick.

For over three weeks.

I swear to god, I'm going
to expose you to the police

if you don't bring me Lana now.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Here lies your sister, Lana.

And I am making my
delivery as I promised.

Archangels' trumpets shall blow

and souls to bodies
will join millions

who will wish their lives below
were as short as thine,

safe...

from the corrupting
influences of the world.


I am a man of my word.

Take your sister with you.


And keep bringing me
my money same as today.

You don't want me
to expose your past

to your rich friends, do you?

Now go! Go away!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You didn't help my boy!


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[engine rumbles]

[engine stops]

[engine running]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Come on, come on.

You can't get sleepy now.

Breathe, breathe.

You gotta walk.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Are you okay?
Where am I?

It was a nightmare.

That had to have
been a nightmare.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



Ah, I was stupid!

I was so stupid!

Lana...

she's dead and there's nothing
I can do to bring her back.

I... I tried getting her

out of that kind of life.

But she refused.
She hated me.

All she wanted was to be
surrounded by those mean people

at that nasty place
they call The Atelier.

It's not even a whorehouse.

It's a living hell.

Who's Lana?

My sister.

A hooker... just like me.

[yelling] I hate Vincent!
Just... calm down.

Is that the man
who runs the place?

I'm sure he did
something to her.

Someday he'll come after me.

You gotta stay strong.

Rest assured nothing is gonna
happen to you, Mrs. Crawford.

Rebecca!

Rebecca is my real name.

It's my only name!

[cricket chirping]

Why do the outcasts suffer
more than everybody else?

Who protects a hooker?

[cricket chirping]

â™ª O mio â™ª

â™ª Babbino caro â™ª

â™ª Mi piace Ã¨ â™ª

â™ª Bello... â™ª

[accompaniment stops abruptly]
[gasps]

THE CRADLE: Again.

[accompaniment resumes]

THE CRADLE: You
are magnificent.

[glass shatters]

â™ª Bello â™ª

â™ª Vo'andare in â™ª

â™ª Porta Rossa â™ª

â™ª A comperar â™ª

â™ª L'anello â™ª

â™ª Sl, sl â™ª

â™ª Ci voglio andare â™ª

[music fades]

You know, this man is
paying us for doing nothing.

It's ridiculous.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Look at this.

Come here.

This is so cool.

What's in there?

[music intensifies]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I want my toys!
I want my toys!

I want my toys! [sobs]

Woman, chill out.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ONACONA: I feel sick.

I lost my kitty.


It was driving me mad.

I was like...

how could this be
happening to me?

I looked everywhere.

I saw nothing.

Then I lifted my butt up
and had a warm sensation.


And I found it!


When are you
gonna cure me, Daddy?

Help.



ONACONA: [yells]

Shh. Shh.

[shushes Onacona]


It's okay.
I'll get you another cat.

[quiets down]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

She's harmless.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

My daughter's immune
system is attacking her.

I brought you here
to entertain her.

But first, I have to make
sure you're healthy girls.

So I'm going to give you
a couple of health tests.

I want you to wait in
the room next door.

I feel okay.

THE CRADLE: Please.

[door creaks]

Onacona, I'm gonna check you.

So be a good girl.

Foot up, please.

[moans, sobs a little]

Okay.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Oh.

It's normal to have all
the swelling and bruising.

And the blood along
the stitches is normal.

It's healing.

And you're gonna
do a lot better.

Those sweet young girls
that you just met,

they're going to help us.

They were kind enough to donate
their skin to your cause.


And daddy will get you
another kitten, okay?

[door creaks shut]

MEL: Hey, do you wanna
get laid now or what?

Don't grab me like that.

Hey, stop!

Get off of me!

Aah!
THE CRADLE: [grunts]

[punching]
MEL: [screams]

[sinister music]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[muffled moan]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[muffled moan]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[string version of
"Cradle Song" plays]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'm here to guide you.

My mission is to make sure that
both get to the Spirit World

in a peaceful way.

Sleep well.

You'll be newborns again.

I am your cradle.

["Cradle Song" continues]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

No! Stop!

[waves crashing]

You shouldn't shout like that

when someone's
near the edge of a cliff.

[seagull squawks]

Tony, are you afraid of dying?

No.

But I do my best to avoid it.

You don't trust me.
I know that.

Why don't we go
back to the car?

You'll have to walk my dog

and help me shop at the farmers'
market, I warned you.

[gasps]
[grunts]


[rocks tumble]

[large wave crashes]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[sniffs]
What happened to your neck?

You mean the spots on my skin.

Every week, there was a client
that used to visit Vincent.

This man would pick
one of us at random.

And one night, it was my turn.

I let him put a needle in me,
thought it was dope.

He ran out of it
and went to get more.

I remember I saw
myself in the mirror.

And I noticed...

several bleached spots
on my skins.

Where exactly is The Atelier?

I want to meet that man

and find out what really
happened to your sister.

It's too late for that.

You see, you don't know
what it feels like

making a mistake
that you regret forever.

When I was 12...

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

...my mother...

she was murdered.

And my sister... she was
taken away because of me.

I do know about regrets.

It happened a long time ago.

And I never saw her again.

But I won't give up
until I find her,

in this or the next life.

Don't lose hope.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I wish I had known you before.

You shouldn't
whisper like that

when someone is
near the edge of a cliff.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

If you think introducing
me to my wife was a favor,

you're wrong.

Get in here,
let's make this fast.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This is the damn holy grail
we've been looking for.

Hydroquinone.

It's a bleaching drug.

Harmless in small quantities,

but deadly when
highly concentrated.

I mean, the quantity that... that
monster needs to do something

like this must be humongous.

Look at her face.

That's the real
color of her skin.

BOBBY: That changed
back to normal.

The effect was temporary,
but the damage is permanent.

These... these black spots
popped up as a consequence.

Look at this.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

BOBBY: See, this foam made us
think it was only the fentanyl.

He drugs them
with the opioid

and bleaches their skin
afterwards.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

YOUNG TONY: We should
build a treehouse one day.

That sounds great.

We'll use these trunks
to slide from above.

Do you think
this is a good idea?

What?
Making a treehouse?

No, what we came here for.

Nothing bad is gonna happen.

That's our escape route.

Don't worry,
they won't follow us.

Oh, wow, we better leave, Ana.

We'll grab a piece
of honeycomb and flee.

Understood? Do it!
Okay.

[bees buzzing]

Come on, Tony, run!
Ow!

Move, Tony!
Move, move, Tony! Move!

[bees buzzing]

Help me!
ANA: Hold my hand!

Hold my hand!

Oh, she had rough, but
beautiful hands, Bobby.


Thanks.

Don't thank me.

Just do your job.

LINDA: I could prepare
a bleaching cream using

hydroquinone for
age spots, like this.


As a matter of fact,
any experienced pharmacist

could do it, Tony.

But, pay attention.

I wouldn't use more than
an 8% concentration level,

which is enough to make you
look like Michael Jackson.


Let me see what you
brought me this time.

[sinister music]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This is the highest
concentration

I've seen in my life.

If he was to use a
cream on somebody...

What if it's not a cream?
What?

TONY: What if it's
taken intravenously?

Are you serious?

It would be a death sentence.

My supplier, a
pharmaceutical company,

is the only place you can
buy it in big quantities.

And they wouldn't sell it

to just any John Doe
with a checkbook.

Linda?
What?

Could you please get me a
list of all their customers?

I don't know if I can.

I... I would have to check.
I need it.

Please, you have to.
[cell phone rings]

I'll do what I can...
Hold on.

Where are you heading now?


Damn it!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Wake up, Vincent.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I guess you rich people don't
let your debts go delinquent,

do you?

By the way,
I'm sorry about the other day.

[unzips bag]
[loud pop]


What is this shit?


Fucking cocksucker
bitch, what did you do?


I'll fucking end you, bitch.

[gunshot]
[groans]

No, no, no!

[gunshot]
[screams]


Let me go!

No!

[grunts, screams]

Let me go! Let me go!



REBECCA: [whimpers]

Tie this bitch to the table...

REBECCA: [sobs]

...and bring me the chainsaw.

REBECCA: [screams]
Let me go!

[gunshot]
Oh!

[gunshot]
[screams]

I'm looking for
a man with one ear.

And I think you know him.
VINCENT: Ah!

Can't you see we all
have ears on our heads?

[gun clicks]

VINCENT: No!
No, no! No, no!

He's just,
uh... another customer.

He... a buyer!
He pays a lot for my bitches!

You're a scumbag.

You supplied that man with the
girls and he slaughtered them.

Don't blame me.

Her... her sister, she
delivered the bitches.

Let her go.

VINCENT: Oh, oh wait, I... I...

[speaks French]

You're looking for
the... the lot lizard.

[gun clicks]




REBECCA: [grunts]

Let me go!
Come on! Come on!


Don't thank me!
Don't thank me!


VINCENT: [screams]

Bitch!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[door creaks]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]




[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This is a kalanchoe, my
grandpa's favorite flower.

It means "never dies."

And they can survive a drought

in case you forget
to water them.

I remember he gave me a
kalanchoe bouquet once.

It was on my 16th birthday.

He made me repeat the name over
and over so I could learn it,

and so will you.

BOTH: Kalanchoe.

Grandpa taught me that.

It symbolizes the faith that
we must have in the afterlife,

as it is eternal and beautiful.

We never die.

We just... continue our path.

He kept repeating the name
of this flower over and over

every day that he was certain
he would pass away.

It strengthened his faith.

BOTH: Kalanchoe.


THE CRADLE: Oh, there you are.

Hey... yeah.

Where did you get these?

You are persistent.

The child who became an
FBI agent just to find me.

All your career,
you've been obsessed with

chasing human traffickers.

Oh, you got the awards and
medals for putting pimps,

rapists, sex offenders
into the deepest shit.

You know, the paradox is...

you're gonna wind up
literally eating shit.

And for what?

You're fighting
for a lost cause.

It'll never stop.


[sinister music]

And by the way...

don't bother looking
for your crazy sister,

because you ran away
and left her behind.

[music intensifies]


Mister?

Mister, I can't walk.

You must help me.

You must take me
to the hospital!

Mister? [grunts]

You must help me.

All the times I've turned a
blind eye for all the bitches

you took from here!

You must help me now!


Oh, oh, oh, merci. Merci.

[grunts and groans]

Merci beaucoup.

[gasps, grunts]



Get out before he comes back!




ALBINO GIRL:
He's gone. Leave!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[coughs, pants]

Where can I find him?
[whimpers]

Come on, take me to him.

What's his real name?

Tell me.

Let's go.

I hope you live a good life.

[banging]
Linda!

Open the door!

Oh my god, are you all...
It's me!

Tell me that you got the list.

I think we should
look at that cut.

Just tell me if you've got it!
Yes!

And I'm not giving you
the freaking list

until you go upstairs,
take a shower,

and let me take care
of your face.

It's gonna get infected!

Go!

Oh.

My friend confirmed that
they only sell hydroquinone

to pharmacies and
licensed dermatologists.

[presses down key
repeatedly]

This is endless.

It's gonna take too long.

Can't finish this here.

[dog pants]

[birds chirping]

I'm glad to see you again.

You may have the day off.

You have become
very fond of him.

[car door shuts]

Ask him to pick me
up tonight at 9:00.

Da.

[car starts]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I'll be right back.
Have a drink.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[singing in Spanish]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I know what you think.

I bitch about these
places and here I am.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I needed this.

I was a nervous wreck.

I guess some skills are
impossible to forget, huh?

SECURITY: Hey! Don't touch.

I forgot to bring
you any small bills.

That's a pity.

SECURITY: No touching!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You know I had to run away
from that place, don't you?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I freaked the fuck out.

I couldn't think.

Sorry if they hurt you.

Can you forgive me?

Is that the begging pose?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Why did we come here?

I don't understand.

I told you, I felt shitty.

The stress is draining me.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Promise me you won't make
me talk about my past anymore.

I promise.

They hit you bad.

Let me take care of you tonight.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

MAN ON RADIO: Ten-ninety-seven

at Three-Thousand One
School Canyon Road.

PC one-eight-seven.

PILOT: Approach from
your 10 o'clock in 2 miles.

MAN ON RADIO: Roger.

[helicopter blades whirring]

FEMALE REPORTER: The details
of what police say probably took

place inside this dumpster are
almost too gruesome to share.

The body of an 18-year-girl with
about 90% of her skin covered...

For Pete's sake, we're not a
bunch of gray-haired respected

experts talking
behind the podium.

If the fucking weather only
gives us time for documentation

or collection,
the choice is clear.

WOMAN: Can we get
some more markers here?

Oh fuck, a cloud's rolling in.
Excuse me.

[radio beeps]
[indistinct radio chatter]

[camera shutter clicking]
WOMAN: Almost done here.

Cruz?

What an unpleasant surprise.

Were you all stoved up?

You wanna get back
in shape, come with me.

[indistinct chatter]

[radio beeps]
[indistinct radio chatter]

[camera shutter click]

[indistinct chatter]

Go ahead, look at her.

There are no second chances
in this life, Tony boy.

You might've
oughta think about that.

You could've saved her
that night at the brothel.

I hope you don't
ever forget her name:

Diane Lorne.

Another country girl
looking for El Dorado.

And what a vicious circle, too.

When they ain't got
a pot to piss in,

they always wind up
taking the trashy jobs.

Maybe it wasn't her choice.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Wearing that thing
was humiliating!

Don't get sassy with me, Cruz.
I am plumb tuckered out.

And I don't need your face
to remind me of

how fucked up the world is.

I had a promotion coming my way

and you messed it up
that night at the brothel.

So as far as I'm concerned,
you can vegetate in the asylum.

You don't work with us anymore,
so get the fuck out of here.

And you vultures back off.

No more feeding!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[engine stops]

[pigs snorting]

[rooster crowing]

Mr. Lorne has
agreed to meet you.

You said you've come to talk
about his daughter, Diane.

Yeah.

It better be important.

The man got Parkinson's
about three years ago.

I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.

He easily loses his temper.

Coffee?
No, thanks.

Are you a reporter?

I hate reporters.

No, sir.

Is your daughter Diane Lorne?

Yes, yes.

TONY: When was the
last time you saw her?

What?

When was the last
time you saw her?

MR. LORNE: Oh
yes, two days ago.

She packed up her
things and left.

Was she involved with
someone when she left?

Can I take a look
at her bedroom?

[mumbles incoherently]

What are you waiting for?

DIANE: Get out
before he comes back!

MILDRED: Are you okay, sir?

Let me show you something.

We... we don't know
what they mean.

And look at all this
writing on the walls.

She wrote all of it.

It's Cherokee.

These are love letters.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[clears throat]

Well, a year ago,
her best friend

ran into Diane on a city bus.

Apparently she...
she seemed happy.

She was in love with an old man.

At least, that's
what she told her.

And that's the last
thing we knew of her.

Do you know what that
man did for a living?

No!

My sweet child... was the
smartest student of 'em all.

This is a Presidential Medal.

It's hers.

Only a handful of
students get this.

I just... I just...

want her to be happy.

Can you help us to find her?

TONY: Mr. Lorne...

I'm afraid...

your daughter, she
won't be coming back.

Her body was found
a few hours ago.


TONY: Someone should arrive
soon to inform you about it.

You're probably gonna hear

a lot of things
about her you won't like.


I want you to know...

that I met your daughter.

In fact, I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't for her.

She saved my life.

But I couldn't save hers.

I couldn't save her.

I should have listened to
my gut when I saw you outside.

Where is my daughter?

Her body will be
at the county morgue.

An agent will be here very
soon to give you the details.


TONY: I'm sorry.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

MILDRED: [sobbing]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Dude, you look like crap, man!

When was the
last time you slept?

Look, I can't leave you
alone for five freaking...

Let's see if the city issued
any parking tickets between

10:00 and 11:00 that night.

I want to check all the plates
and credit cards registered

in this machine that night.

We did that already!
We got nothing!

We'll check them again!

One by one!

Credit cards,
plates, everything!

Go talk to Uber, Lyft.

Maybe he didn't drive.

[helicopter blades whirring]

Tony, we're gonna...

He can't hurt
those girls anymore.

I promise you.

Trust me, we're gonna get him.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

THE CRADLE: She's a peaceful
girl and she needs company,

so talk to her and,
uh, entertain her.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Hey!


You need a charger for that.

I have one.
You want one?

[toy phone beeps, dings]


Here, take it!


[toy phone dings]


Will you let me pray?!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


Whose fault was it?

to leave this place!

ONACONA: [parroting]
I want to leave this place!

I want to leave this place!


Surprise!
[sobs]

It was you and all
the white people.

Yeah.
[gasps]

You're to blame.

50 pounds sterling to slaughter

and take scalps
of young Native men

12 years of age and older!

Let me go!

And all that propaganda
back in the day, hm?

[sobs]
Yes.

Convince public opinion
in America

that we started the practice.

We were expunged from our land!

We deserved extermination.

Now, you look at her!

You sprayed our land
with radiation

to test your chemical warfare
technology.


No, Daddy, please
don't hurt her!

Daddy, don't hurt her!

VENUS: [screams]


We didn't do it for the money.

We wanted the souls!

Can you feel it?

[sinister music]

This room... is
packed with souls.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

One ticket was
issued that night.

This is a list of all the
plates the machines spit out.

We cross-referenced everything.

There's a vintage car.

I'll check this one.
ROCCO: Okay.

Now look at this.

They buy huge quantities
of hydroquinone every week.

Check the front door.

What do you see there?

Is it a shield?
A... a... a drawing?

I don't know.
Maybe a bir... is it a bird?

TONY: It's an owl.

Maybe it's nothing, but an
owl means death in Cherokee.

Come on, Tony,
my cousin Jemima

has a parrot in her house.

Doesn't mean she's a murderer.

I'll handle it.

ROCCO: Dude, all
right, come on, man.

Relax. Just relax.
Let's fucking do this, bro.

I'll get a team,
we'll go to the owl house,

and we'll get it done.
And you?

care of yourself, man.

Next time I see you, I don't
want to see you looking like...

You know what I mean.

Now, come on.

I'll let you know
what I find on the car.

All right.

[gun clicks]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Let's do this.

[cell phone rings]

ROCCO: What's up?

I made it to
check up on the car.

ROCCO: We at this
sons of bitch's place.

Ugh, and it smells like shit!
What?

ROCCO: He's not
here, but we IDed him.

The Cradle's real name
is Tikinagan Cook.

62, Native American, loaded.

We're sending his picture
to every law enforcement

and federal agency.

And we found tons of
cases of hydroquinone.

And a bunch of human scalps on
some type of Indian calendar

with names by each of them, each
year marked by eight scalps.

Wait, there's only
six on this one.

So he's probably planning
for more victims.

Rocco, can you
check if her name...

ROCCO: Ana's name
is not on here.

Tony, don't worry.

JOHNNY: Rocco?
What's up?

I'm feeling a
little dizzy, man.

I'm gonna go outside.
Okay.

Hey, man, I gotta go.


ROCCO: Stewart should
be here in a minute.

Thanks, bro.

You're a beast.

We'll celebrate tomorrow,
all right?


Ugh, it's nasty in here.

Come on, don't be a pussy.
You okay?

Please, stop!

I'm not gonna hurt you.

What's wrong with you?

I want food.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Take this.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What happened to you?

I mean... to your skin?

My father knows.

You know him?

The skin falls off and he
stitches it back on again.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Did you like it?

I'll bring you more.

Wait for me.

[speaks Cherokee]

[speaks Cherokee]

You speak our language.

I see... a tortured soul.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Today... we celebrate
the Sun Dance.

I'll free your spirit...

and release you
from your suffering.

You're a disgrace
to your people.

You've tortured those
girls for nothing.

That woman in the other room,
she's dying!

[music intensifies]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[muffled grunts and groans]

[speaks Cherokee]

The Ani-kutani taught us that...

anyone who can stand the pain

will come back from
the Spirit World

and return to their
physical bodies again.

But... since human
decomposition begins about,

uh... four minutes after death...

when you come back, your tissues
will be broken and the enzymes

will have eaten your
cells from the inside out.

And you'll wake up...

with bacteria, worms,

and insects inside a grave.

What you said is true.

My daughter... she has a disease

that's consuming
her entire skin.

[string version of
"Cradle Song" plays]

THE CRADLE: And she is dying.

All the skin transplants
I've made are just...

just not working.

The steroids aren't
protecting her anymore.

They're just making
her gain weight.

So I'm gonna try
once more with you.

TONY: [grunts]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You're going to get cold

and you're going to get dizzy.

And your vision is probably
blurry by now, isn't it?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

And a strong odor
will exit your pores.

Now, this is normal.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Why do you look
at me so tenderly?

You must be delusional.

It's probably liver failure...

...and you're about
to go into shock.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Mom...

Anything you wanna tell me?


What are you doing...

What are you doing here, Mom?

I think you'll be ready

in just a few minutes.

TONY: Mom... that woman
in the other room...

THERESA AND CRADLE:
What of her?

Wolfsbane!

I gave her a large
dose of wolfsbane,

poison to end her misery!



[speaks Cherokee]

Huh?

All right, I'm gonna have
to give you a laxative.

No, I hate it!

You've gotta get rid of
everything you've eaten!

pooped myself 100 times!

[groans]
Well, then answer my question.

Did someone come in here and
give you something, yes or no?

There was a man.

He gave me candy.

Well, why did you eat it?
He's trying to kill you!

[sobs]
[grunts]

Okay, okay, you're
gonna have to throw up

everything in your stomach.

No, no!

Yes!

Your sister was crazy.

Your sister was... crazy.

kalanchoe.

Kalanchoe?

No.

Never dies.

You must be burning
up in that dress.

Oh, should I change?

Maybe you prefer my
pole dancing outfit.

Not exactly.

But you could say that.


WAITRESS: Hey, guys.

Here, take this.

It's your New Year's kit.

I...

I'm so sorry.

No worries.

[indistinct chatter]

So?

Oh, jeez.
I'll be right back.

[indistinct chatter]

[water running]

[switches tap off]

[sinister music]


[door creaks]

[yelps, screams]

Don't move.
[shushes Rebecca]

Gone from the world...

[clank]
REBECCA: No!

VINCENT: No! Shh.

Quiet!

REBECCA: [screams, sobs]

[shushes Rebecca]




[whimpers, moans]

Lana?

[neck cracks]
[gasps]

[Cuban music playing]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Your date?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This is a decent place.

I've been hiding from that woman
and the Frenchman for years.

Do you know what a slave is?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Here's your check.

I hope I never see her again.

[indistinct chatter, laughter]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I just got a phone call.

I got good news for you.

Do you remember... that day

when you scattered
your sister's ashes?

Do you remember when I asked
you to promise not to ask me

anything about my past?

I prefer if we just...

Not talking about her?

Just bear with me.

I kept the box your
sister's ashes were in

and ran a DNA test.
You did what?!

This guy confirmed they
weren't your sister's ashes.

She's gotta be at The Atelier,

and I wanna help you
get her out of there.

We should go.

Let's go.
Come on, come on, get up.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[sinister music]



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Just keep going.

I've had it.
I wanna leave.

She's not here.
What makes you so sure?

Do you know what
happened to her?

No, why... why would I know?

I think you know where she is.

What the fuck
you talking about?

That's better.

Much better.

I prefer this version of you.

It's a juicier role
to play, isn't it?

I don't understand
what you're saying.

Oh yeah, you do, Lana.

You do understand.

When did you switch places?

Was it the night I
came here for her?

Look at me.

You can quit faking it.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You think you know
everything, don't you?

But the truth is
you don't know shit.

You don't know what it feels
like being fucked 70 times a day

just because you have a
sister you have to protect.

I took care of her.
I took all the bullets for her.

It was so convenient
for that little worm,

having me in her life.

And how did she repay me?

She left me alone.
I want to go.

So that gave you the
right to lock her up here?

You are gonna take me to
where she is right now.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

No.

You didn't lock her up.

I had to survive on my own!

She should have stayed by my
side, but she buried me alive!

So she didn't deserve
to live, did she?

She was a selfish woman

who thought she could buy me
with her stupid money.

Please, Tony.

Forget her.

Tell me...

how was it with me
the other night?

You can have as many nights
like that as you want.

So she's not alive.

You don't get it.

I had to survive on my own.

Is she alive?!

No, no, she's not, okay?!

She had it comin'!

Can we go now?

You deliberately handed
the girls to The Cradle.

You're gonna pay in jail
for what you've done.

Fuck off!


You trust too much
in people, Tony.

That's your weakness.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Have you seen my son?

Tell me!
Don't touch me!

Tell me! Tell me!


Tell me! Tell me!


Get out of my way!

Let go! Let go!

Get off me.

Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

Aah!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

TONY: I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Follow me.
We need to hurry.


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Stay here.

Stay here!

[music becomes sinister]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[glass shattering]

THE CRADLE: [yells]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

ANA: No, no, no, no!

No, no!

Mom!

[screams]
[metallic slicing]

[yells, groans]

CRADLE AND THERESA:

[music quickens]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Kalanchoe, kalanchoe!

[water rushing, crashing]

Ana!

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Kalanchoe.


[water rushing]


[gentle music]

[birds chirping]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Ana? Ana?

Mom?

Oh, god.

Tony.

Do you see?

It wasn't your fault.

Ana.

I didn't give you away.

I always thought
that I was the one...

Not anymore.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Son... you have to go.

You don't have much time left.

But I wanna be here with you.

People need you.

[wind gusting]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Where are we now?
I'm scared, Mom.

Don't be.

Remember, Tony, we never die.

We just continue our path.

And you must continue yours.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You can do it, Son.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[whistles tune]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[tune continues]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[intensifying organ chord]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

WOMAN: [cries, yells]
MAN: [pants]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]




[gentle music]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

It's all right.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You can move forward now.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Cruz?

Shame on me for being
a selfish prick.

Fuck promotions
and all that shit.

I want to apologize to
you for the other day.

You've been so devoted to
helping all those girls and...

I know they're grateful, Cruz.

Agent Cruz.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Mr. Cruz, are you going
back to work for the FBI?
