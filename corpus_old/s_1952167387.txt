Help me, Lora.

Pick up.

Come on, pick up.

Hi, this is Ashley. I'm not available right now,
but if you leave your name and phone number,

I will call you as soon as possible.

Ashley, it's me. Can you just call me back
as soon as you get this.

Damn it, Ashley, pick up the phone.

What is that?
Weren't they supposed to come home last night?

You know what ?
I'm never gonna pass Chemistry.

Well, maybe if you study more,
and spend less time.....

I'm, uh, I'm studying.
It's just..

I'm just not good at science.
Mr. Carl hates me.

Yeah, right.

Good morning.

Hi dad.

What happened?
You're supposed to be home last night.

I tried to call you.

I'm sorry, honey.
I must have turned my phone off.

O0oh, coffee ?

We had a late dinner meeting,
with one of our biggest clients.

And we got for a drink after.

Didn't Chris know that meant you
have to drive all night?

Honey, it is business.
You know, sometimes you have to humor those people.

What, especially these guys,
the kind of money they spent.

I'm tired.

You okay ?
I'm fine.

I'm just busy planning the church fundraiser.

You shouldn't take up responsibility at the church.

I'll be okay.

Besides, I like being feeling like I'm doing something good.

Look, things are going to slow down soon,
I promise.

And I'll take some time off,
we'll go on a vacation.

I promise.

We'll go some place fun.

We can go to my dad's farm ?

No, I want some place fun.

I can take Carolyn to school,
if you need a break.

Does anybody have any question?

Why is this picture so depressing?
The artist wants to convey sorrow and sadness.

He even picked a background that
reflect the model's emotions.

Why is the picture so blurry ? Looks like the photographer move thecamera during long exposure.

That's actually a very good question.
He wants the image to look more like..

faded memory, or a painting.
Not just a simple portrait.

Alright guys, that's actually it for today.
And, next week assignment..

..try thinking outside of the box,
don't worry about the rules,

bring me something creative.

Just be different.

U hahev no messages.
Hello.

Hey, Mr. McDowell.

Lora, you look a bit stressed.
Is everything alright?

Everyhting is fine, I just didn't get
enough sleep last night.

Are you finished for the day?
Classes, yes. But I still-

have this stuff to do for a project.

Why don't you go home and get some rest, my dear.

I can't.
My deadline is tomorrow.

Listen, don't try to take it all in..

I assure you tomorrow night's activities,

are rather important to the university.

I know, Mr. McDowell.
I'll trym thank you.

Barry, long time no see.

Yeah, no know, working, the usual.

Still wearing those silly thing?
It's not so nice in here.

Yeah, I know.
I'm just being extra careful, I guess.

Better safe than sorry.

What is it this time?

Is everything okay?

I didn't get any sleep.
Did you and Peter have a fight again ?

Peter and I are done.

Help me.

MacGey's.

May I speak with Ashley Gerritsen, please?

Who's this?
It's her sister.

Sorry, she's not here right now.
Can you tell me the next time she works?

She's off today, I think
she'll come tomorrow.

Hi, this is Ashley.
Can get to the phone right now, but..

We have this bond.

When she's sad, I am too.

Or when something's wrong,
I can feel it.

If she's in pain,
or if somebody hurts her..

then it hurts me too.

You have no idea how life has been.

I mean, having a twin in a lot of ways is difficult,
I don't think people realised.

What do you mean?
I mean, it's like we belong together, like one person.

It's never Lora or Ashley,
it's the twins.

I'm responsible for her actions,
and it's not fair.

I know I'm sounding to selfish right now.
But..

Not at all.

Having your own identity is crucial to every aspect of ..

your physchological development.

Resenting your sister is very normal
in this kind of situation.

You said you've been having dreams about her?

Didn't you say that you two have only recently
established your relationship..

together, is that correct ?

I just ...

I just wanna fixed her,
I can't.

Stop it.

Seriously, stop it.

Stop!

Stop it.

Ashley, don't.

God damn it, Lora.

What the hell did you do ?

Lora, are you alright?

You know what,
I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now.

I can't do this anymore.

<i>Hi, this is Ashley.
I can't get to you right now ..</i>

Lora.

I didn't think you're coming?
Well, I wasn't gonna come, but..

..very glad I did.

Is it fine if I get a candid picture of you two ?
Actually ..

Sure, go ahead.
Alright, smile for me.

Thank you guys, have a good night.

Lora, you can't still be upset with me.
It been what, a year ?

Yeah.
Besides, I said I was sorry.

As if sorry makes everything okay, right ?
That's not fair, Lora.

That's not fair either to me,
that's what's not fair.

I made a mistake,
what else do you want me to say ?

I think I made a mistake, too.

So what's this then,
you're leaving ?

I'm afraid so.
Lora my dear, is everything okay ?

I'm fine.

Can't sleep ?
No.

Can I get you anything ?

No.

No, thanks hon, I'm fine.

Where is Carolyn?
In bed.

On the phone, of course.

How are things with the fundraiser ?

Crazy.

But somebody's gotta do it.

Just don't overdo it.

Probably you could fine somebody
to help you with that.

You wanna talk?
You work all the time.

Besides, I like feeling like I'm
making a difference.

This is..

Barry, stop.
What's wrong with you ?

Stop it.

God, you won't like it like that.

I'm sorry.

It's okay, let's just go back to sleep.

I'm gonna call Dr. Woods in the morning,
and see if he knows what's wrong with me.

You have trouble with your ears again?

Yeah.

I think it gets bad lately.

You've been taking your medication?

I miss a couple of doses.

Wy would you do that ?

The stuff makes me feel like a zombie when I take it.

You heard what Dr. Woods said, though?

You have to take the medications for six months,
even if you think the ringing stops.

I don't know what.

I know.

Fine.

I'll call Dr. Woods in the morning,
and see if he can squeeze you in..

..but in the meantime go take your medication.

Honey, it's in the car, somewhere,
I'll take it in the morning.

Love you.

Get your ass over here.

What did I tell you playing in your church clothes ?
I'm sorry daddy.

You're gonna be sorry when I get you home.

Didn't I tell you not to encouraged your sister ?

What?

What do you want to be when you grow up ?

I'm gonna be a dancer.
And I'm gonna dance for thousands of people.

People will give me standing ovation...

..and a handsome gentleman will bring me flowers,
and I'll be famous the world over.

No, you won't.

Shut up, Lora.

So, what do you wanna be?

Nothing, I just wanna leave this place.

Just see what's beyond those streets.
I wanna go to a big city ..

Go to ballet school.

You're too old for that.
No, I'm not.

You are.

You have to start when you were four or five.

Well, I'm a quick learner,
I can do it.

Great. If we get out of here first.

Ashley, I need you to promise me something,
right here, right now.

Promise me that we'll never be separated.

That we'll never be apart,
the only way to leave this place is to stay..

..together.

We have to get out of here.

I'm Lora, I talked to you on the phone.
I'm Maggie, I'm a friend of Ashley.

Have you seen her lately?
I saw her a couple of days ago.

She's supposed to be here this afternoon,
I tried contacting her, but no answer.

Look, hey Larry, I'm taking a five minute break!

Don't worry.
I'm sure she's fine.

I've known her for about four years.

She's a great kid,
she just mae some bad decisions.

Have you tried going by her house yet ?

It's a small place about five miles down.

It's the house we grew up in.

I just never thought I've to go back to that place again.

No, didn't she..

She's mentioned you a couple of times.

Never said you being twins and all.

But, here's some things about Ashley
that I don't reallt know.

Yes, she's always been so secretive.

She never told me if anything bad happened to her..

I've just somehow, uh,
I've always known.

How long has it been since you two talked
to each other?

It's been about six years.

But now, that's all that matters.

We may think seeing you are what Ashley's
missing right now.

I hope so.

Mr. Kane.

You can come on back now.

Have a seat right here.

The doctor will be with you in just a minute.

Hello Barry.

How's the ringing been treating you?

I've decided to give it a name.
A name?

Since it's not going away,
there's only one thing to do.

I call him 'Maximilian'.

Max for short.

And he's missed.

I'm gonna get you.
No, you're not.

One...

eight, nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come.

Damn it Ashley, how many times do I have
to tell you not to run back here ?

I'll whoop you're ass right now.
What happened, daddy ?

Your dumb ass sister was running around,
and bummed her head.

Go inside and get the first aid kit.

What the hell are you waiting?
You want her to bleed to death?

Who are you?

Lora.

Hello?

Hello?

Lora, you must like me.

Lora!

How many more of these bags do
we need stuffing?

Just a few more.

So what time is Barry gonna be home ?

He'll be here any minute now.

Where is he anyway?
Doctor's office.

He have a problem with his ears.
Poor thing.

All the problem's he's having with Tinnitus
and the time he spends on the road working.

I'm surprised we're still together.

What do you mean?

Let's just say that things have changed.

How?

Hello? Go on.
I don't know.

It's the little things mostly.

He's not as patient as he used to be,
he seems stressed out about something..

Who knows?
Maybe it's just me.

But, things don't work out.

How are things in bed?

Carolyn, will you please turn down the music ?

Now, Carolyn!

It sounds like someone could
use a cup of coffee.

That wil be great.

I'll go and make it.
No, relax.

I'll make the coffee.

Thank you.

Hello, stranger.

Haven't seen you for a while.

Looking pretty handsome.

How you doing?

So, met the doktor?

It's a revelation.
I'm supposed to be taking my medication...

See. I told you.

Now go upstairs and get dressed,
we have to go to the church in a little over an hour.

I know what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

You are going to the church with me,
even if I have to drag you, kicking and screaming.

Mum, i need to go to the pharmacy,
before we're going to church, okay ?

Why are you telling this now?
We have to leave in a little over an hour.

I'm just going to get some styff, okay.

Fine. Just go talk to your father,
and see if he can take you, alright ?

I like your chest ?
Really.

I' like everything.

Dad?

What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

I'm fine.

I need you to take me to the pharmacy,
I need to get some stuff.

Sure.

Are you sure you're okay ?
Honey, I'm fine.

Just go.

How can help you?

I'd like to file a missing person's report.

Name of the missing person?

Ashley Gerritsen.

Age?
25.

And when did you first notice that she was missing ?

Today, I guess.

You're telling me that she's not
missing for 24hours yet ?

We can't really file a missing person's report..

.. until the person'smissing for 48hours.

I can't get hold of her, I've called her,
been to her house..

.. been to the place she works, nothing.
But that doesn't necessarily means she's missing.

Aand if she doesn't show up for work tomorrow,
and you still can't find her..

then you can come here and report.

Sorry, dad.
Honey, I'm sorry...

There's this ringing in my ear,
it stops and it'll be back tomorrow.

Do you think mom will let me go to Jen's
party tomorrow ?

I don't know.

You went to Jennifer's house last week,
and weren't you supposed to be back by 10?

But that's not fair, because Jen's parents were
supposed to take me home..

.. and they didn't come home until late.

Yes, but you didn't tell us that Jen's parents were
gonna be there.

Or we would have let you go.
Fine.

Can we just tell mom about this tomorrow ?

Light's green.
Sorry.

Dad, I think you need some help.

No, it's just been a long week.

Hey, did she show up yet?
Afraid not, sweetheart.

And boy, Larry is pissed.
And if she doesn't show up soon..

.. he said he's gonna fire her.
Did you try her house ?

Yeah, I went there, and then I went to the police station,
trying to file a missing person's report.

They said there's not enough time passed,
and that there's nothing they can do.

Ashley is gonna be fine, like I said before,
sometimes she just blew everything off.

In fact she just broke up with Peter
a couple of days ago.

Who's Peter?
Her old boyfriend, he's a real loser.

Do you know where this guy Peter lives?
Maybe she's over there.

I sure hope not.

Let's give it a try.
He lives in a trailer park four miles down the road.

Town and Countty.
It's an old trailer in the back.

It's a piece of shit, can't miss it.

He's here two days ago.

Help me.

Help me.

Help me.

B9.

I know. It's just gonna a little bit longer.
We got plenty of prizes to give away.

It's okay.

Lora, is there something wrong?

Lora, is there something wrong?

Something wrong with Ashley?

Yes, there is.

You want me to call your father?
No.

Please don't call my father.
No, it's okay.

I won't call him if you don't want me to.

Lora, I can't help you if you don't
tell me what's wrong.

There's nothing you can do.

What did you say?

I'm going to kill him.

Papa, leave her alone, please.
Get out of here.

You're hurting her.
Go, now.

Don't hurt her, please.

No.

No.

O52.
Bingo.

Hello?

Hello?
Come in.

Hello there, can I help you ?

Is Father Lay still around ?

I used to come here when I was a little girl.
Of course he's till here.

In fact, he's in the back right now.
I'll go and get him.

Thank you very much.

Hey, the gambling thing.
Watch the gambling thing.

Sorry, Father.
Lora Gerritsen is here to see you.

It's great.

Abby, i'm gonna skip outside and
get some lemonade.

That sounds good, can you get me some too, please ?

Thanks for coming.

How's the bingo going?

Pretty good, Father.
Abby seems to be on top of things.

I have somebody here I'd like you to meet.

This young lady used to be one of our
parishioners.

That was odd.

Is he okay?

He's just probably having problem with his ears.

He's had Tinnitus. Ringing in the ears.
Pretty awful.

Daddy, what is wrong with you?

I22.

Barry, what's wrong? You seem like you've seen a ghost.

Can Vivian take you home ?
I gotta get out of here.

We just got here.
I don't feel well, okay.

I just need to leave.
Go.

Just go. I'll see you at home tonight.

We knew everything that ever happened
around this place.

Well it's true. You met today,
well it's new.

Coming back through this evening.
What time do you get off ?

You don't waste any time, do you?

Hold on a moment.

Just a second, honey, let me open the door for you.

Hello, sweety. Lord, it's raining cats and dogs
out there.

Yeah, I need a room.

Alright. Hold on one second.

We ust clean this up this morning.
Thanks.

Thank you.
You have a nice evening there.

You need a help?

I'll be right there.

I shouldn't have been there.

What took you so long ?

Here we go again.

Barry, here's somebody I'd like you to meet.

He's just having a problem with his ears.
He has Tinnitus.

Pretty awful.

I'll be back in 24hrs, okay?

Barry, you okay?
I'm alright, I'm fine, just don't worry.

Are you sure? You seem really stressed out.
Your ears bothering you?

Does everything have to be about my ears, Abby?

If this happens, if that happens, it's Barry's ear, right ?

Why are you yelling at me?
What did I do.

I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry.
I'm just stressed out.

Chris is going to Miami, there's many things
I have to do before I can go.

Honey, it's okay.

It's my fault. I shouldn't be putting so much
on your plate.

No it;s not your fault, I'm just being an asshole.

You are not being an asshole.

You're a good man.

I love you.
 I love you too.

Understand me ?

Make sure everything's nice and clean over here, alright.

Miss Gerritsen, we will need you to come down to
the police station to ask a few questions.

Sorry, miss.

Miss. Gerritsen, is there anything we can get you?

I've been here for three hours.
When can I leave?

Sorry.

Miss Gerritsen.

We spoke to some people at the
'Mickey's Diner' about your visit yesterday.

Obviously you're looking for your sister.

And we do know you came by..

..to file on a missing person's report yesterday.

And it appeared that we may have found your sister.

I knew she was in trouble.
It's always been like that.

That twin's communication thing, right ?

Our forensics people have indicated that you..

.. that your sister must have been dead
for at least two days.

There's no physical way that you could have
know anything about this.

You think I had something to do with this?

Nobody's accusing you of anything
right now, but..

.. it is a very strange situation,
don't you think ?

I'm through joking with you.

You wanna keep me here,
you better charge me with something..

.. and let me speak to my attorney.

I don't think that will be necessary.

Just a couple more routine questions,
and you'll be free to go.

You know of anybody that might wanna
hurt your sister ?

Ex boyfriend?
No.

Enemies?
No.

Co-workers?
No, no one, okay ?

Alright, you're free to go.

Don't leave town anytime soon.

When can I bury her?

I'll get back with you.

Bobby's coming over tonight.
What do you mean he's coming?

He wants to see me, in the backyard.

You're crazy. Dad will find out,
he'll kill you.

To hell with him.

I'm jealous.
I know you are.

What is this?
It's chicken and soup, daddy.

Taste like shit, that's what it is.
Then don't eat it.

What did you say?
I ask you a question, girl.

Leave her alone, dad.
I'll make you something else.

No.

Look what I did to you.
I hope you die and go in hell.



Where is my tea ?

You're finally here.

You're slow.

Just like your mother.

Get out of here.

Where is my tea ?

Lora, what are you crazy ?

It's so good to see you again,
my child.

Is Father Lay around ?
I'm afraid not, he's ..

He's in town, running some errands right now,
you're welcome to come in and wait for him.

Actually I can't.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

I need to get hold to somebody he introduced
to me yesterday.

Kind of a tall gentleman..

He wore these earplugs.

You mean Barry.

He's wonderful. His wife, Abby,
has been wonderful to us.

I was supposed to get to know his wife, before, I uh..

somehow managed to misplace her number.

I have it.
I'll get it for you.

Mom,somebody left this for dad.
Alright, I'll see you later.

Morning.

Is everything okay?

Somebody left that for you,
at the front doorstep.

Strange.
It sure is.

Yeah.

Thanks for opening it.
Believe me, I wish I hadn't.

<i>You left this</i>

<i>You left this</i>

Honey, those looks just like the earplugs that you wear.

Is there something that I should know
No, it's just ...

It was just a practical joke.
One of the guys at work.

Some joke ?

He drove all the way here, to leave you a note, right ?

Yeah, just throw it away.

Don't worry, it's a bad joke.

Daddy, are you okay ?

Mom left so that I have to take care of you alone.

Mom died in a car accident.
She loved us.

She didn't love you, She loved Ashley,
she loves drinking..

She loved us.

What was it ?

<i>How can you sleep after what you did to me?</i>

<i> You sick person.</i>

It's my office.

He calls you in the morning,
who is he ?

Who is this?
Why are you calling me ?

Who do you think this is, Barry?

I don't know.
Why are you calling me ?

<i>You tried to kill me, you sick.</i>

<i>Guess what, I'm back.</i>

It can't be.

Come on.

Come on.

Stop. 

Stop. 

No, it can't be.
Get up.

No.

I'm so sorry about Ashley.

I still can't believe she's dead.

When I found Ashley's body..

I found this.

I know who killed her.
His name is Barry Kane.

How do you know it's him ?
Because when he saw me..

..he freaked out, like he has seen me before.

And there's something wrong with his ears,
that's why he is wearing those earplugs.

He's been to the Diner a few times,
and he seems to be interested in Ashley.

And if I'm not mistaken,
he was at the Diner the last time she worked.

We need to go to the police ?
And tell them what ?

We don't have any proofs.
Then what are you gonna do ?

I'm gonna do what needs to be done.

<i>Hi, can I speak to Barry Kane please?</i>

He's in the shower.
Can I take a message ?

<i>Sure, this is Ashley, i'm the waitress at Mickey's...</i>

<i>he left his jacket here a couple
of days ago.</i>

<i>Just let him know that he can come by and
pick it up anytime he wants.</i>

Okay, thank you.

Some girl named Ashley,
in a place called Mickey's ..

called to tell to tell that you left your jacket
ac ouple of days ago..

..and youcan go and pick it up.

That was nice of her.

I'll grab it on my way out of town.
Honey, what's going on ?

What ?
Everything's fine.

Who called you last night ?

Co-workers.
At two o'clock in the morning ?

Our plans have changed. I've got to go to Tampa
instead of Miami.

I gotta go.
I'll call you from the hotel.

Just you today ?

Yeah, I was just wondering if Ashley's
working today ?

She doesn't come until tonight.

Lora, you're not gonna believe
who just came to the Diner.

<i>What happened ?
I went over to see, then..</i>

<i>he asked if Ashley's was working.</i>

What did you tell him?
Well, I didn't know what to say.

I told Ashley would be working later tonight.

Okay, Maggie...

I have a plan.

And I'm gonna need your help.

<i>I like your chest.</i>

How many tonight ?
Just one.

Your serving will be here in just a minute.

Hello, Barry.

You're alive.

Ashley...

Sorry, I ..

I didn't know what to do.

Look, if we can go somewhere and talk..

.. I can explain.
Okay.

I'll pick you up here.
No.

I'll meet you there.

Where?
Don't you remember?

Th e place where you left me.

Not now.

How do I look ?
You look just like her.

Are you sure you're gonna go through with this ?
I have to.

Alright.

It's showtime.
Oh, wait.

What is this ?

I know I can't stop you, but take this,
just in case ..

Take it.

Barry, does your wife know ?

I bet she wouldn't like that, now, would she, huh ?

How'd it feel, Barry?

How'd it feel to lose it all ?
To lose your family, to lose everything.

How does that feel ?
Enough of this, where are you ?

Get up !

Get up !

I said, Get up !

Now!

It can't be you, I ..

You threw me in the river ?
You thought I was dead ?

Is that what you thought ?

You're not alive !

You need to be dead !

I said, Get the fuck off !

Why are you doing this to me ?
I never meant to hurt you, I swear.

I thought you were dead.
Let go !

I didn't know what else to do !

I thought you were dead !

No!

Why couldn't you leave me alone ?
