I'm a bit unstable

She said with a Cheshire grin

So many cracks in my sidewalk, boy

Well, don't you fall again

Feels like the things that I've wanted

The most in this life, I can't have

So you see, I've been damning the world

Before it damns me

She said I'm naked and shameless

And I'm peeling back the layers like

An onion girl

Don't try to save me, just stay away

'Cause I might make you cry

Like an onion girl

It's my boat.
When I get it fixed up, it's, uh...

1964. It's got a mahogany hull.

It's racing class.

God, this place is really depressing.

No wonder they're closing it down.

My, uh...

My sister's here.

Molly.

Yes.

So... Are you picking up a relative?

With a moo-moo here

Excuse me?
And a moo-moo there

Here a moo, there a moo
Everywhere a moo-moo

Old McDonald had a farm

E-ya, E-ya-yo.

And on his farm he had some pigs

Mr. McKay?
Yes.

I'm Dr. Prentice. I was beginning to
think that maybe you wouldn't show.

The other patients left years ago.

Yeah, well, I've been kinda busy.
Is he okay?

With a moo-moo here
and a moo-moo, mooooo...

He's been very happy here, Mr. McKay.

Yeah, I guess ignorance is bliss, right?

Of course everyone is a little
agitated about having to leave.

An orderly will be
bringing Molly down shortly.

However, I thought
we might have a little chat first.

Yeah, sure.

E-ya, E-ya-yo.
Hello, Domingo.

We still know very little
about Molly's condition

Every patient is unique.
The way she relates to certain people...

even on an emotional level,
suggests an amount of retardation.

In other respects, she's autistic.

But over the years
she's become quite higher functioning.

Which is why with a little help,
she should be able to adjust...

to life outside an institution like this.

She even has minor
savant-like talents.

I know, she recites stuff "verbatim",
she's Dustin Hoffman.

But the fact is she's pretty much
non-functional, right?

In recent years, Mr. McKay,
you haven't spent much time with Molly...

So, what I need you to know...

are her basic needs, and how to effect
them, so she can be comfortable and I...

...can have a life.
Thank you.

I copied out the daily routine
that Molly feels most comfortable with.

That routine is very
important for Molly.

We'll be monitoring her progress
on a daily basis...

at least for the next few weeks.

You need to remember that
like many autistic people...

Molly has very acute hearing.

Loud noises
can be extremely painful to her.

Hi, Molly.
Molly, do you remember Buck?

Your brother?
No.

Don't you remember last Christmas, Molly?
I took you out for a walk.

No.

Well, I guess we should go now.

It's okay, here we go.

Mr. McKay, let her go.

May I speak with Molly?
Alone?

Molly, come here.

Who is this guy?

Sam's been with us for
the past couple of years.

He has a severe learning disability.

He communicates with Molly
on a level I don't fully understand.

Sort of her interpreter...

Her guardian angel.

Thank you for your help.
Bliss, Mr. McKay.

Don't hesitate to call.

This is home, Mol.

Hi, it's Jennifer.
Asshole.

I'm gonna bring around those comps for
tomorrow, but I'm gonna be working late...

so I don't know
at what time I'll get there.

Big kiss!

Molly wet.

Wet!
What's wet?

Pants!
Molly wet pants...

Dr. Prentice, you didn't tell me
she was still wetting herself.

This was not part of the deal.

It's a reaction to the
breaking of the routine.

Well, how long is
this reaction gonna go on?

The sooner she's gonna start,
the sooner this sort of thing will stop.

Thanks.

Come on. Okay, uh ...

So, are you gonna take 'em off?
No.

Okay, what am I supposed to do here...

Molly, come on.

Hold on for a second, okay?

Molly hungry?
Yes, Molly hungry.

Do you like pizza?
Molly like peas.

No, not peas. Pizza.

Peas!
No, pizza. See?

Pizza.
Peas!

Whatever.

Peas! Peas!
Molly, be quiet.

Okay now,
what time does the presentation start?

Shit.

I thought it was 10:30.
Prescott told me it was 10:30.

At what time does daycare open?

Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
Alright? Bye.

Pizza.

Starch, modified flour...

[ various chemical preservatives
and flavor enhancers used in pizzas ]

I've been eating that?

Come on, Molly.
Buck's late.

Buck's late.

Mol, careful. It's slippery.

Come on, Molly.

Are you the person in charge here?

Yes, Joyce Leslie.
Joyce. Right.

I'm Buck McKay. 16th floor. My assistant
Brenda called you about unruling Molly.

Yes, of course.
Is Molly here?

Yeah. She's right here.

She's got her bag, and if you need
anything, you have my number.

Okay, then. Bye, Mol.

Mr. McKay, is this some sort of a joke?

Mr. McKay?
Yes?

Is this a joke?
No.

This is not a child, Mr. McKay.

I know, but she has the mind of a child.

Mr. McKay, we're just not equipped
to handle Molly. I'm sorry. Goodbye.

Bite me.

You're late, Mr. McKay.
I know.

Ms. Duffy, this is my sister Molly.
Can she sit here, while I...

Come on. Sit down. Thank you.

Molly, sit down.

I'm gonna be right in there, okay?
Wait for me.

There's nothing new
in the juxtaposition of...

contrary images, but in this campaign...

the hula-girl and the Eskimo...

the luau and igloo...

give us unique comic possibilities
for years to come.

Now that he's (?) to join us,
let me introduce Buck McKay.

Buck?

Excuse me, may I help you?

Molly hot.

Hot.

The following campaign
reverses the situation...

and plants our favorite igloo
smack in the middle of Redondo Beach.

Polar Pete, of course,
has got his best baggies on...

The wife, Hula,
has got great bikini range.

Possibilities here for infinite varieties.

We could have a different swimsuit for
every beach east and west of Wajamea bay.

Out they come, Polar Pete and...

Molly hot, Buck.

What's going on in there?

What happened? I was...
Don't talk.

Just get her dressed.
Molly hungry?

Pizza!
Bren?

You go take her out for pizza
and then take her to my place.

Molly, I'll be there as soon
as I can, okay?

Oh, my God!

Good morning, Sharon.
Good morning, Buck.

Georgia.
What's up?

Big trouble.
What happened?

The icecream account went to Beresford
and Weir. Prescott wants to see you.

Great.

I put this in the closet...

Mr. McKay, I ...
It doesn't mean anything, Carmen.

I don't know what's wrong with her.

Did you talk to your sister
about babysitting Molly?

Oh, I don't think she would do it.

I know what you mean.

Sorry, Bren.

It's okay.

Hi, Molly.
Hi, Molly.

How was it?
Fine.

We watched the "flying monkey" scene
from The Wizard of Oz, like, six times.

That's one of her favorites.
Thanks for this.

I'm gonna miss you.

You're a good boss.
You're a good liar.

Bye, Molly.
Bye, Molly.

Well, I guess this is it, huh?

See you later.

So, I talked with this guy,
he's one of our sponsors,

and he's fine with you working at home.
Write and copy.

I don't wanna work part-time at home.
I wanna get out.

I understand that, but in the meantime
this will tide you over.

I'm living like a hermit.
And when I do go out I feel guilty.

It's okay.

Molly, dog.
Look at his eyes, Molly.

Oh, Molly, they're toys.
They're not real. It's okay.

All she does is channel-surf.

Or she lines up her shoes.

Yeah, it's like living with Imelda Marcos.

And she knows.
She's not completely out of her.

She knows I'm gonna be on her stir-crazy.

I've got a surprise for you.

You've got a visitor.

I'll leave you to it.

She was, huh, reading to me.

Robinson Crusoe.

It would be great if she had
any idea what it is about.

Oh, you'd be surprised,
Mr. McKay.

Look, I've got a job
at the Kerrans Institute.

Oh yeah?
Yes.

Dr. Prentice got me a job.

Actually, he's been
calling up asking, uh...

well, recommending Molly for
one of their new programs.

Yes.

Really? That sounds good.

I mean, it would be up to you,
of course...

But if they...

if they find her suitable...

then they'll take her of your hands...

for a while, anyway.

I know.
It's hard, Mr. McKay.

Anyway, it's a bit
self-serving for me...

I have a learning disability.

Maybe because of that...

we're kind of on the same wavelength.

When she reads to me,

I see the words...

right here in front of me.

There's a real person in there, Mr. McKay.

She wants to come out.

Mr. McKay?
Yes.

I'm Dr. Brookes.
Hello.

Hello, Molly.
Hello, Molly.

I've discussed Molly's history
in great detail with Dr. Prentice.

Right, he said that she was
an ideal candidate for this program.

Well, we need to determine that
now with our own series of tests.

You know, Dr. Brooks, Molly has
some extraordinary talents.

The tests actually include
a series of PET scans of Molly's brain...

so, I have some forms
that I need you to fill out.

Oh, sure.

We make a tiny incision
in the skull, right here.

Using a probe we transplant a set of
genetically re-engineered cells...

hopefully restoring the dormant
area of the brain to partial utilization.

Oh, and she would be able to,
you know, like...

I mean, look after herself
on her own, for example?

That's a definite possibility.

But there's always
a risk in any operation...

and with the brain, those risks involve...

stroke, paralysis, motor functions.

They're rare, but they do happen.

How rare?
Perhaps six percent of the cases.

Six percent?

This has got way out of hand.

I mean, I may be a selfish schmuck,
but you're my sister.

Selfish schmuck.
This is a life or death issue, Mol.

I mean, you're happy some
of the time, aren't you?

No!

Am I just wanting this for myself,
because I'm a little inconvenieced?

But it would give you a chance to,
you know, have a better life.

Hi, Susan.
Hi, Molly.

You can undress behind the screen.

There he is. Hey, man.
What's the word?

They're still operating.
How are you?

So, we're just gonna hang out here, okay?

Is everything alright?
Yeah, she's fine.

How are you doing?

Ouch, huh?

Dr. Brookes! Dr. Brookes!

What's happening?
What's going on?

Lorezepam, phenytoin, two-in-one.
Got it.

Mr. McKay, get out of here, please.

Thank you.

Lita, I'd like to see Dr. Simmons in here.

Dr. Simmons, ICU staff.
Dr. Simmons, ICU staff.

It's okay, Molly.

I just got off work.

She had some kind of seizure.
Yes, I heard.

But it's gonna be okay.
What makes you so sure?

Mr. McKay, sometimes
I have a sense of things...

and I feel something
extraordinary is gonna happen.

Mr. McKay?

She's resting now.

We have no idea what
caused that reaction.

Well, that sounds familiar.

She's alright now.

She could've died, right?

I'm not going to sleep with you.

I'm not planning on either
of us getting much sleep.

And I'm certainly
not gonna sleep in that bed...

not without giving the mattress
a good airing first.

Hi.

I slept on the couch.
You can ask Fiona.

Alright. I will.

Fiona!

Molly, are you ready
for some more tests?

No!

Our projections show...

that the red dot should
now be about the size of a dime.

I'm afraid the grafted cells didn't take.

So, what happens next?

In a a few weeks we'd like to try again.

Are you serious?
Yes.

After what happened last night?
Buck, we're breaking new grounds here.

We learned so much from
the last procedure.

Yeah, by drilling into people's heads
like they're lab rats.

My sister nearly died.

I'm not let her go through
something like that again.

God damn it, son of a bitch.

Son of a bitch.

God damn, son of a bitch.
God damn, son of a bitch.

Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!

Molly cold.
Yeah, I know you're cold, Molly.

Molly cold.
Yeah, I know you're cold...

but the car won't start, okay?

Molly cold.
Come on, you son of a bitch.

Would you shut up? Shut up, Molly!
Just... God damn it...

I didn't ask for any...
I didn't ask for you... So just shut up!

I'm sorry, Molly.

I'm sorry.

Somewhere over the rainbow

Bluebirds fly

Birds fly

over the rainbow

Why am

oh, why

can't I?

Nothing good on, hey, Mol?
Nothing good on, hey?

Let's go for a ride.
Do you wanna go for a ride?

No!

There's nothing wrong
with your television set.

Do not attempt to adjust the picture.

We are controlling the transmission.

You are about to experience the awe...

and the mystery which reaches
from the inner mind to...

the outer limits.

What do you think?

Looks like the Milky Way
just fell out of the sky...

Four million, eight hundred thousand...

three hundred and two.

What?

Stars.

Here it is. The list. "Thee" list.

Can you say "the list"?
No.

It's okay, you don't have to.

Okay, the plan is while I look for a job,
you'll become self-suficient.

Cool, huh?
No. Hot!

Yeah. Okay, this is a list of
of things you need to learn.

Do you understand?
No.

Good.

Now, you can see I've divided it
into the basics.

We have personal hygiene,
recreation, and eating. Hmmm...

Now, every time you complete a task, we put
a check mark in the box beside it, you see?

No!

Now, when you get all the boxes checked
you're gonna take a trip in Buck's boat.

Let's try it. Okay.

What is your name?
Molly!

That is fabulous!
You see, now...

I'm making a big red check mark...

in the box beside
"Says name when asked".

Okay, next.
Where do you live?

Here!
Absolutely correct...

but you need to learn your
actual address to get a checkmark.

Tying shoes?
That's getting a little...

Yes! Tie shoes.

Alright.
Tying shoes it is.

Okay, you take the two ends...

and make the incredibly difficult
and death-defying overhand knot.

Molly tries.
Molly...

Right, you've made the loop. Good.
What do you do after that?

Go around the loop. Remember:
Nobody's ever done this on their first try.

Okay, try again, try again.

Okay, what do we do first?

We'll try again tomorrow, okay?
No.

Go to bed.
Sleep tight.

The wonderful things he does.

We're off to see the Wizard.

The wonderful Wizard of Oz.

Go! Now, jump!

We're off to see the Wizard.
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.

We're off...

Mr. McKay!

Go on, dance.

Oh, shit...

My name is Molly McKay.

I live at 200 Mildred Avenue,
Venice, California...

90291.

If you look over to the last image,
that's... that's present...

and we had no idea that
there would be that amount of cell growth.

I'm a bit unstable

She said with a Cheshire grin

So many cracks in my sidewalk, boy

Well, don't you fall again

She said I'm naked and shameless

And I'm peeling back the layers like

An onion girl

Don't try to save me, just stay away

'Cause I might make you cry

Like an onion girl

I think it's going to rain.

Yes, it's getting darker by the minute.
Yes, it's getting darker by the minute.

Was that a flash of lightning?
Was that a flash of lightning?

Lightning?

Flash of...

lightning.

Lightning.

But I needed
none of all this precaution...

for never man had a more
faithful, loving, sincere servant...

than Friday was to me.

Without passion, solemnace or design...

perfectly applied and engaged...

his very affections were tied to me...

as those of a child to a father...

and I dare say he would've
sacrificed his life...

for the saving of mine,
on any occasion whatsoever.

Hello, Buck.

Why do they put
"died" people in the ground?

Dead people.
"Dead" people.

It's a religious ritual.

There are a lot of people in the world.
Yes.

Well, if they all die, then eventually
the world's gonna be one big cemetery.

That's a good point.

Some people are cremated.

Cremated?
Burnt.

They're dead.
It doesn't hurt.

How do you know?

That's a good question.

I wish I knew how they we're like.

Yeah, but they say they're
in a better place now.

Ground is not a better place, Buck.

You know, before, I lived in a hospital...

Well, it was more like a home.
Yeah, for people like me.

And you waited until you had room...
and then you came to get me?

Yeah.

You see, the home got its
money from the government.

And one day the government
just decided to close it down.

Do you think they can feel us
lying on them?

Maybe.

I'm really glad we're getting out.
Yeah!

I'm changing.

I have all these emotions
that I don't really understand.

There are some things that I
wanted to talk to you about.

What things?

I'm getting smarter by the minute.
Oh, that's nothing to worry about.

Yeah, I'm reading a lot of books.
That's a good thing.

My vocabulary is growing exponentially.

Good word!
Thank you.

What's a blowjob?

It's right here.

Hey, batter, batter, batter!
Safe!

Yes!

Go, Dodgers!
Go, Dodgers!

Come on, baby!
Come on, baby!

Yeah. High inside.
High inside.

Hey, are you hungry?
Yes.

Right, stay here to watch the game.
Wait.

I don't understand the game yet.
Okay.

See that guy there?
He throws the ball to the guy right there...

who tries to hit it with the bat.

The bat.
And if he does, he has to run to the base...

before those guys can throw the ball
to the base...

and if he touches the base
before the ball arrives, he's safe.

Safe.
Safe.

Safe from what?

From being out.
Out of what?

I'll explain when I get back.

It's a weird game, Buck, but I like it.

Yes!

Go, baby!

Safe!
You dumb shithead! He was out by a mile!

Sit down!
The man dropped the ball!

What, you've got binoculars on your ass?
No.

What are you, some kind of retard?
I'm an irregular retard. And you?

Wise ass.
A wise ass retard...

I'm not familiar with that.
What's going on?

I'm having a disagreement
with that wise ass retard.

Look at them go. Man, I wish
I could hear what they were saying.

Come on. What's going on?

Who are you? Ray Charles?
He was out by ten feet!

He was out by ten feet.
He dropped the ball, dicknose.

He dropped the ball, dicknose.

Ten feet!
You dropped the ball.

Get out of my face!
No, you get out of my face!

Your breath smells like the
shithouse door on a tuna boat!

Oh, my God!

This is the best part of the game so far.

That was a great game.
Would you take me again?

Absolutely.

You're the best brother
in the whole world.

I'd like to wake up with you
in the morning...

feel the stubble on your chin...
your hot breath against my cheek...

What?
We're brother and sister.

So?

We'll talk about it later.

Brothers ans sisters cannot get married.

Why not?

Because that's the way that things are.

Why?

There are scientific reasons.

People with the same genes can't...
you can't mix 'em.

We don't have the same jeans...

or even wear jeans.

It's a different meaning.
It's G-E-N-E-S.

It's a different spelling.
Oh, I know that, then..

Genes provide the blueprint
for what organisms become.

Where did you get that from?
I read a lot of scientific books.

As Jackie Collins.

So... what can
brothers and sisters do...

if they like each other a lot?

They can be friends for life.

That's all?
That's a lot.

How come we weren't friends before?

I guess we didn't know
each other that well.

You wanna dance?

No. This is not a place where you dance.

Yes, it is.

Molly, sit down.

Come on.
Molly...

Come on. Sit down.

Dance with me.
No.

Race you to the door!

I'm right behind you!

Careful.
I won.

Hi, Molly.
Hi, Jim.

Mr. McKay, Dr. Brookes wanted
to see you in her office when you got in.

Thanks, Jim.

You cheated.
I do not cheat.

Bye.
Good night.

She's supposed to be in bed by eight.
Yes, I'm trapped.

She asked me to marry her.

What did you say?
No.

Stop it, Buck. Okay? Please?
This is not funny.

This is the first time that anybody
has gone through something like this...

and we have no idea how
she's gonna react to all those stimuli.

We just have to take things very slowly.

I'm sorry. She's wonderful.

I'm gonna thank you for...

giving her to me.

Thank you.

For the first time in my life, I feel...

kind of blessed, I guess.

Thank you.

You haven't said how it was today.

I don't know how much she remembers.

Well, ask her.

So that gives a complete analysis of
the components of the blood, right?

That's right.
Where did you find out about this?

All these books up here.

Now, when I play them back,
I can finally understand them.

How do you mean "Play them back"?

They're like videos.

Where did you read all these books?
At the home?

Every book on Dr. Prentice's shelf.

So, did you have a nice time
with Buck last night?

Yes, i did. Thanks.

The old room 306.

Hello, Lauris.

What ever are you doing here, James?

What do you think he's doing there,
Lauris? Guessing your weight?

Duh!

Hi, Molly.
Wanna go shopping?

Oh, no. I can't.

Are you going out?
Yeah, I'm going out with Sam.

Do I look weird?
No, you look good.

Let me say you something.
What?

Well...

I'm gonna take these off.

Why?
Because you already have eyelashes...

and they're perfectly beautiful
just the way they are.

See, Molly, the purpose of makeup
is to accentuate your strong points.

But I don't have any strong points.

Yes, you do.
No, my eyes are too close together.

I look like a baboon.
You do not look like a baboon.

Yeah, I do, I do.

I saw them on TV.
Probably my great-great-grandfather.

Why do you say that?

Because we are descendents
from them, aren't we?

We'd probably have big blue
bottoms, who would grow bigger...

when we wanted to have sex.

Our bottoms do tend to get bigger
but not just when we want to have sex.

Unfortunately...
Okay, that's great.

Oh, my God! He's early!

Come in.

Hi, Dr. Trehare.
Hi, Sam.

Is Molly here?

Yeah! I... She's...

Why don't you...
Why don't you, uh, have a seat?

Alright...

Wow, Sam...
What ever are you doing?

I thought we were going for a walk.

Oh, yes, I do believe you are correct.

Tra la la.

I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

Sam?
Yes?

Do you like me?

Yeah, I like you.

Well then, how come you never...
kiss me?

Well, I... Uh...

'Cause, you know, when people
like each other, they're supposed to kiss.

Well, yeah.

I guess so...

I know how to do it.
You do?

Yeah.

Well, I know how to...
I know that...

Wanna do it?

Well, I mean, it's not
that I... that...

Wait. Okay.

What?
Nothing.

What?

I'm just... Uh...

Let me go to work.

Bye.
See you.

See you.

Bye.

Sam?

Yeah?
Are you alright?

Yes, I'm fine, uh, Dr. Brookes.

Just a little anxious, that's all.

Scarlett got you on the run, huh?

Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
It's just... That's gone...

A little bit of lipstick.

Hello?
Jackie Collins is right, you know?

There is an epidemic going on.

Of what?

Beverly's boyfriend is sleeping
with half the women in town...

And Susan is cheating on you... with Sam.

What?

Hello, Molly.
Hello, Molly.

Is something wrong?
A problem?

Problem.
Something needs airing?

No, the only thing that needs
airing is your mattress.

Molly, what...
Do you think I don't know?

You just stay away from him, you slut!

Molly...
Isn't it enough that you're trapping...

my brother into a
meaningless relationship?

What?
If I ever see you near Sam again...

I swear to God...
Molly, you're being jealous.

I am not being jealous!
It's okay.

It's a normal adolescent emotion.

I am not an adolescent!

I am a 28-year-old woman!

God, why can't you understand that?

Why can't you understand that?

Molly, it's okay.

We've all been there.

I just felt... like... before...

Before?

Before you fixed my brain.

Hello, Domingo.

Thank you, Sam.
Sure, Janet.

Sorry about yesterday.
Me too.

Yeah.
Me too.

I know I was a little weird.

No, I was... uh...

I just hope we don't
have to be embarrassed.

I mean, it's still us, right?

Yeah.

Whatever happens, it's...

Whenever you're ready.
Not now.

Whenever you feel ready,
then... you can kiss me.

Would you kiss me back?

Absolutely.

At what time do you get off work?
Two o'clock.

Would you be my date?
Yeah.

Good.

Bye.
Bye.

The forbidden fruit, I think.

You smell like an animal.
Thank you.

These are a more
youthful kind of perfume.

Do you like it?

Nham nham...

Well, that's our entire range.

Which one did you like the best?

We'll... think about it.

Eyes...

Look your last...

And lips...

Oh, you, the doors of breath...

sealed with a righteous kiss.

A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

Romeo, stop! She's...

She's asleep.
She's not even dead.

She's just asleep!
Stop!

Juliette, wake up!
Wake up!

See? She's okay.

Jeff, can you give us a hand here?

I got it. It's okay.
What are they supposed to do?

She almost knocked my teeth out.

Are you alright?

What's wrong?
Are you alright?

It's okay, we got it.

At the beginning,
I knew it was a play...

but it became very real.

I would love to be in love like that.
Wouldn't you?

Absolutely!

So passionate...

Here nobody ever says
how they feel about anything.

I mean,
look at those two people over there.

They have not said a word
to each other since they sat down.

Look at them!
Shhh!

Well, they're obviously angry at each other.
Why don't they just say something?

I just wish they would scream.

Well, if everybody screamed when they wanted
to, the whole world would be a mad house.

At least it would be more honest.

Sir?
I'll have the mussels and the tornados.

Medium-rare.

Madam?

Molly, and what's your name?

Uh, Richard. Have you chosen?

I'm gonna have the mud cake...

chocolate mud cake
and then the key lime pie.

Uh-hm, and to begin?

I'm gonna have the chocolate mud cake...

and then the key lime pie.

Sir?

Sir?
Yes?

Order?

I'd like a coffee.

And?

Uh... Black.

Yeah.

Sam, aren't you hungry?
I'm starving.

No, coffee's fine. Thank you.

Sam, it's okay, I'm treating.
Seriously.

I know the prices here are outrageous
but that's why I do the stuff I do.

So we can come to places like this.

Coffee's gonna be just fine
for me, thanks.

Okay...

Molly, is something wrong?

There was just a silence.

I screamed for all of us.

Sam doesn't want any food.

I thought Romeo was beautiful.

Yeah, and Juliette was,
uh, not bad either.

How are these for size?

Oh, my God!
Sam, get that one!

Okay!

They can't breathe out of the water!

Go away from me!
Please, go back to your table.

They are choking!

Are you alright, Sam?

Audrey, I could use some help.

Sorry.

We will pay for the dry
cleaning of that dress...

I'll drink to that.
Those lobsters live in a tank.

They're someone's pets.

Why would you eat someone's pets?

Well, Molly, I didn't think of it that way
but I'll try to do better next time.

Thank you.

Buck, would you dance with me?

Why not?

Sam dances well, doesn't he?

Sam is great.

Would you like him as a brother-in-law?
I'd be honored.

Good.

You're gonna have to give me away.

Dad says it's okay.

Dad?

Yeah.

I talk to them in my dreams.
They're not in the ground anymore.

Once you die...

at least you don't get any older.

That's one good thing.

Are you sure you wanna see this?
Yeah, I do.

Honey, do you wanna give
your present to Mol?

Buck!

Come on over, Buck.
Come on, sweety.

It's real nice and soft.

Guess, Mol?

What's this for Mol?
I wonder what it is.

What is it? Sweet!

It's a bunny, Molly.

Sweetheart, look at the bunny!

Look at that little soft bunny.

Oh, it's the cutest little bunny.

Buck, come over to the table.
Come on.

In the world where I come from...

nothing is predictable.

And sometimes everything's
crowding in on you.

So you have to hunch in
on something small...

and certain... and safe...

In your world...

almost everything's controlled.

But for us, it's all jumble.

And sometimes you just have to scream.

So people look at you strangely...

and talk about you as if
you're not even there.

But you always know what they're saying.

They get very upset when you scream.

But often I know that they would
just like to scream themselves.

I think that's what I find
most strange about this world.

It's that nobody ever says how they feel.

They hurt...

but they don't cry out.

They're happy...

but they don't dance...

or jump around.

And they're angry...

but they hardly ever scream...

'cause they'd feel ashamed and...

nothing's worst than that.

So we all walk around
with our heads looking down and...

never look up and see
how beautiful the sky is.

So, what's actually happening?

Her immune system
is attacking her new cell growth.

It's not something we expected...

because it originated from
her own genetic material.

The problem is to identify a suppressant
which will switch off that part...

of the immune system
in the timeframe that we have.

Well, why not shut the whole thing down?
She'd die of a cold in a week.

Look, you did this thing to Molly,
okay? You made her into a person.

What are you saying exactly?

There is a chance of the whole
process completely reversing.

This is crazy... I mean...

She is not gonna go back to what she was.

Okay? We gotta work at this
and we gotta stop this thing.

There was always the possibility
of this happening, Buck...

you knew that in the beginning.

No, I didn't know that you were gonna create
a whole new person and just give up on her.

She was always a person, Buck.

When the hell are we gonna
tell Molly about this?

I think she knows.

I think she has known for quite a while.

I felt some things, but
it was just in the last few weeks.

Why didn't you say something?
I don't know.

I guess I was scared.

You're not going back.

I'm not gonna let you.

You're here and you're my sister and...

we're gonna get through this thing
together. Aren't we?

I don't know.

We're gonna beat this thing.

I'm so scared.

I'm really scared.

I'm not gonna go back.

I don't wanna lose all this.
I don't wanna lose you.

You won't me lose.
Yeah, I will.

You have to go and find somebody else.

You do.
No, Mol...

Yes, you do.
It's not gonna be any different...

...than how it was before.
No...

You've seen how I am now. You're
always gonna be thinking about that.

You're always gonna be thinking
about how I could've been.

No, I won't.
Yeah, you will.

Do you know why?

Because I'll always know it's you...

no matter what.

Come on, Mol.

I don't think I can do it.
Yes, you can. Come on.

Are you ready? Sit up here.

Just pedal, alright?
Put your feet here.

Your handlebar's there.
Just pedal, okay?

No!

Come on, Mol.
You were ridding yesterday.

You can do this.

Come on. Sit up here.

I'm gonna give you a push-start, okay? And
then you just keep your balance and you pedal.

Alright?
No.

Yes. You can do this.
Are you ready?

Yes. Come on.

Come on. Pedal.

Pedal, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

Keep your feet on the pedals.

Molly, are you okay?

Are you alright?
Huh? Are you alright?

Come on.

Come on, let's try it again.
You did this yesterday. You can do it.

Buck, you can't force her.
What are you doing, for God's sake?

She's gonna ride this bike!
What are you trying to do?

She fell off the bike!
I'm not gonna let it happen!

She is not going back
to being a vegetable!

Sam!

Don't say that, Buck.
Don't say that about anybody.

I'm sorry about out there.

You know when you used to
come to see me every Christmas?

You'd bring me a box of candies
every year.

Well, one year you brought me a hat.

It was a yellow straw
hat with ribbons on it.

I loved that hat.

But it blew off the first time
they took me to the beach.

It sailed up into the sky...

until next Christmas...

you brought me another box of candies.

You remember that?

Of course I do.

I waited for you to come, all year.

When mom and dad died,
you didn't even...

You didn't even seem
to know what happened.

You'd still talk about them,
like they were still around.

Maybe they were.

I was 17, Molly.

All those years that they'd been,
uh, looking after you...

I'd just go up to my room...

When they died,
I didn't know who you were.

I hardly knew how to look after myself.

I always wished that you'd
bring your friends home.

I wanted to meet them.

I didn't want people to see you.

I've never told anyone
I even had a sister.

I'll still be me, Buck.

I'm gonna be just as much
a person as I am now.

I'll just be different.

Hi there.

It's looking good.
You've done a lot of work.

I'm taking it out for trials
in two weeks. See if it floats.

Do you need some crew?

I wanted to tell you that we've
found a good place for Molly.

It's sort of a halfway house.

She'll be moving there
at the end of the week.

We'll all really miss her.

But we'll be able to visit.

I didn't know if you'd be here,
so I wrote down the address.

I'm sure she wants to see you.

Does she know who I was?

Well, you won't know until you go.

Thanks.

It's really close by.
You liked it when we went there.

No!

There's all those big gardens.

You'll be able to help pick
all the lemons and the oranges.

I'll come and see you everyday, Mol.

We'll be climbing
all over those fruit trees.

Well, I'll give you
a lift to the new place.

Is that okay, Susan?

Of course.

I've got a job, Sus.

It's... It's not a great one
but I can pay off my debts.

They re-possessed the other car.

I was gonna come with Molly,
if that's alright.

Molly go Buck.

Yeah.

Molly go Buck.

We'll see you.

And, uh...

I will be needing that crew...

if she's still available.

She is.

I thought we'd stop by on the way.

Molly go Buck?
Yeah.

So...

What do you think of the new layout, Mol?

Good?

Is this the right place for the bed?

I got your cards.

We have a nice light in here.
See that light?

You got enough shoes
there to keep you going?

No.

And, uh...

I got, uh, Carmen coming by everyday.

She wants you
to give her dancing lessons.

No.

I'm hoping Sam's gonna be
stoping by some times.

Sam.

So, it's...

it's gonna be quite a household...

if you wanna join it.

Hello, Buck.

Hi, Molly.
