Watch it!

More harpoons!

Ready the nets, men!

I say kill her 'afore
she comes aboard!

Where is she? Let me see!

Wait. Wait. Wait.

She's a fast one.

Hand me another!
She's getting away!

I think
she's smilin' at you.

I missed her.

Another one.
Come on,
another one!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Move! Move! Get back!

What are you doing?

It's a mermaid!
A mermaid?

Use your eyes!

What were you thinking?

These are
dangerous waters.

And this
is a dangerous time.

Tonight's the Coral Moon.

They say this is
when the Sea King calls

his mermaid
daughters together

to lure men
to their deaths.

Is that
what they say?
Aye.

Not even the strongest
can resist their spell.

It's just
an old lore.

Back to work!

Come on, lads.
You see there?

See what, Hawkins?

Crosswind gust kicked up
the chop, that's all.

That's the
Sea King's doing.
Give me a hand, mate.

He'd pull us
under himself
if he could.

Sail faster!
Raising the main!

This line's tight.

Where's Prince Eric?

Up at the bow,
Sir Grimsby.

Whoo!
Eric!

What are you
doing out there?

Get back here at once!

You ought to stop worrying
so much about me, Grimsby.

Call me selfish,

but I do not want
to tell the Queen

that her son fell
overboard on my watch.

And on his birthday,
of all days.

Looks like there's
a Spanish galleon out there

headed toward the mainland.

We could
follow it to port,

see what
they've brought
to trade.

Our ship is loaded
to the gills as it is.

We've risked
our necks out here

for seven
weeks already.

We're going
home tonight.

Eric.

Pay attention.

I need you
to be more careful.

Careful, Grimsby!

My Daughters
of the Seven Seas,

I welcome news
from all of your waters.

Tamika, Perla,

it's so good
to see you.

Caspia, Indira,

it fills my heart
to have you all here.

Mala,

Karina...

Where is Ariel?

Sebastian?

You were supposed
to see to it
that Ariel was here.

I tried,
Your Majesty,

but that child,
she is impossible.

I reminded her

about the gathering
just this mornin'.

What more can
one crustacean do?

You can go find her.

Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes.

Right away.

"Yes, Your Majesty.

"Right away,
Your Majesty."

How hard can it be
to find a mermaid,
after all?

If I'm lucky,
I'll only have
to search one ocean.

Where are you, child?

We aren't supposed
to be this far
from the palace, Ariel.

Let's go back.
Oh!

How does that work?

Come on, Ariel.
Please?

Oh, Flounder,
stop being such a guppy!

I'm not a guppy.

I think
we've gone
far enough.

Wait.

What is that?

I've never seen that one.

Come on.

Ariel! Wait for me!

You know
I can't swim
that fast.

Whoa. Look at all that.

They must have used
the ship for battles
or something.

Yeah, great.

Now let's get
out of here.

Getting cold fins?
Who, me?

No way.
Good.

Then you can stay out here
and watch for sharks.

All right, good.

What?

Ariel, wait!

Do you really think
there might be
sharks around here?

Oh, Flounder.

Look at this.

Whoa.

It's the smallest trident
I've ever seen.

I'm King Flounder,

Lord of the Seven Seas!

I wonder why
a human would
need one that size.

I bet Scuttle will know.

She always does.

Will you relax?

It's just
your reflection.
Whew.

Calm down.

Nothing is going to happen.

Flounder, look out!

Flounder!

You okay,
Flounder?

Uh, sure.

I mean,
I've seen bigger sharks.

Just, you know,
you can't back down.

You gotta show 'em
who's in...

Come back, Flounder.
It's just Scuttle.

Ariel. Hey, kid,
how ya doin'?

Don't mind me,
I was just
grabbin' a snack.

Scuttle, we found
more treasure.

Yeah. We went
into this sunken ship,

and it was
really creepy.

Human stuff. A-ha.

All right,
all right,
let me see.

Let... Let...
Let me see.

Any idea what this is?

Oh. Oh, oh, oh!

Wow.

This...

This is... Yeah.

This is very,
very unusual.

What? What is it?
It's a...

It's a dinglehopper.

A dinglehopper.
Yeah. Yeah.

Humans use these babies
to style their hair.

You just give it
a little twirl,

a little yank,
you might get
some pieces with it,

and you're left with
an artistically pleasing

conflagration of hair
that humans go nuts for.

Really?
I would love
to see that.

Can't.
Flounder.

You know it's true.

Your father still won't let
you go to the surface, huh?

No, it's forbidden.

He thinks all humans
are barbarians.

Oh, they're not so bad.

Unless you're a coconut.

They hate coconuts.

I swear, they get
a hold of one,

they smash it to pieces,
just like that. It's weird.

And what's this?
Ariel!

Swam half across

a whole ocean lookin'
for this child. Ariel!

Ow!

Sebastian!

Sorry about that!
Ariel!

What are you
doin' up there?

Wasting your time
with this
know-nothing bird

that can't tell
swimmin' from flyin'?

Hey!
I suppose you've completely

forgotten tonight's
the Coral Moon?

Oh, no!

Oh, yes!

The gatherin'
of King Triton's daughters,

minus one.

My father's gonna kill me!

Sorry, Scuttle,
gotta go!
Yeah, yeah.

All right, sweetie.
Me too.

Gotta get some air.

<i>Yes,</i>
<i>hurry home, Princess.</i>

<i>We wouldn't want to be late</i>

<i>for Daddy's gathering,</i>
<i>now, would we?</i>

Perhaps I'll join them.

Oh, wait, what a shame.

It seems that
Big Brother forgot

to invite Auntie Ursula
to the party.

Again.

Oh, I should be the one
throwing the parties,

not waiting
on an invitation.

Oh, the feasts we had
when I lived in the palace!

And now look at me,
the family pariah.

Wasting away
to practically nothing.

Banished and exiled,
driven halfway to madness

in this dim little crevice
for 15 long years.

While Daddy
and his spoiled
little mer-brats

celebrate the Coral Moon.

Well, I'll give them
something to celebrate.

I may have finally found
Daddy's weakness.

Yes.

Red's fascination with humans
might be just the opening

I've been waiting for.

It is irresponsible.

Your sisters are only here

for one phase
of the Coral Moon.

Can you imagine
any one of them

missing the gathering?
No. You're right.

I'm sorry.
It wasn't Ariel's fault.

We... We...
We were exploring,

and a shark
chased us and...

Shark?

So, you went
to the shipwrecks again?

Those waters
are dangerous.

You don't have
to worry about me.

Well, I do worry,
my little one.
I do worry.

This obsession
with humans
has to stop.

I just want
to know more
about them.

You know all
you need to know.

I barely know anything.

You won't even
let us go
to the surface.

Why do you have
to be so strong-minded?

Just like
your mother. It...
I am her daughter.

Yes, foolish enough
to be taken

with the human world.

If you would just try
to understand...

Well, I have tried.

I have tried
to understand you
long enough.

But as long
as you live
in my ocean,

you'll obey my rules.

Do you understand that?

Children,
you give them
an inch,

they swim
all over you.

Was I too hard on her?

Definitely not.

It's like I always say,

"Children got to live
by their parent's rules."

You're absolutely
right, Sebastian.

Hmm.

My Ariel needs
constant supervision.

Constant.

Someone to watch over her.

All the time,
day and night.

And you're just the crab
to do it.

I am just the crab to...

No, wait,
that's not... What?

No, see, I serve you,
Your Majesty,

as your honored majordomo.

There is no better way
you can serve me

than to make sure
my little one

stays out of trouble.

But I...
Yes?

Go.

Go.

Yes, Your Majesty.

How do I get myself
into these situations?

I'm an educated crustacean.

I got options.

I don't need this.

I should be
advising the King,

not chasing after
some headstrong teenager.

Ariel,
are you okay?

He doesn't even
hear me.

I'm just
not like him.

I don't see things
the way he does.

And I...

I don't see
how a world
that makes

such wonderful things
could be so bad.

<i>â™ª Look at this stuff</i>

<i>â™ª Heave ho!</i>

Thank you, gentlemen.

Oh, let's have
a dance, aye.

Oh, come on.
It's his birthday.

Oh, come on, Grimsby.

What's wrong with me
having a little fun?

Everyone else is.

You, sire,
are not everyone else.

It's time
you separated yourself

from the rest
of the crew.

Oh, but
I'm one of them.
And behave in a manner

more becoming
of a future king.

You mean, be more
like my father was?

Cut off from the rest
of the world.

Oh, Eric,
you know what I mean.

When you came to us
21 years ago,

the King and Queen
took you in

and treated you
as one of their own.

Now that
you've come of age...

Max.

Max!

What are you
doing over there?
Come here, boy!

Come on. Come on.

Go on.

And now
that you have come of age,

your responsibilities
are at home.

Your father would
have expected that.

Yes, trapped inside
that castle

in isolation and fear.

I can't do it.

I believe a little
fear may be advisable, sire.

Grimsby,
you're not listening.

I want to be
a different kind of leader.

That's the whole reason
we're on this voyage,

don't you see?

We have to stay open
to what's out here.

That's the only way
our island can grow.

Eric,
think what you risk.

I can't explain it, Grims.

It's in my blood.

Even now...

I feel there's something
out here calling to me.

Storm coming in fast.

Squall coming in!
Squall!

All hands on deck!

All hands on deck!

Batten down the hatches
and crates!

Yes, sir!

Tie 'em down!

Get the ropes in!
Tie her down!

Man the pumps!
Man the pumps!

Pull the main sail!

Clew up
and stow the main course!

We're over-canvassed!

Brail up
the foresail!

Stow all of the sails!

Clew that!

Drop it down.
Open up!

Oi, lads!

Fire!

Grab the port side!

Lifeboats!
Abandon ship!

Abandon ship!

Abandon ship!

Into the water, boy!

Go! Now!
Jump!

Get in. Get in!

Jump!

Give me
your hand, boy.

Come on, get up.
Hold on!

Boy! In here.
All right?

Max.

That's it. That's it, boy.
Come on, boy. That's it.

All right, boy.
Go on. Go on.

Come here, boy!

Max! Come on!
Good boy!

Come on.

Come on, Max.

There you go.

I got ya.
Eric!

Oh, no.

Ahh! Get off me,
you fool!

Oh, hey.
Didn't expect
to find you here.

And I really
didn't expect
to find her here.

Uh-uh. Hey.
You listen to me, bird.

The King can never
hear of this.

We are going to forget
this ever happened.

Ow!
Are you
listenin' to me?

Yes.

You won't tell him,
I won't tell him,

and I will stay
in one piece.
You got it?

Got it. Sorry,
what'd you say again?

I'm a dead crab.

<i>â™ª What would I give</i>
<i>To live where you are?</i>

<i>â™ª What would I pay</i>
<i>To stay here beside you?</i>

<i>â™ª What would I do</i>
<i>To see you smiling at me?</i>

<i>â™ª Where would we walk?</i>

<i>â™ª Where would we run</i>

<i>â™ª If we could stay all day</i>
<i>In the sun?</i>

<i>â™ª Just you and me</i>

<i>â™ª And I could be</i>

<i>â™ª Part of your world?</i>

Check the cove, men.

Checking the cove!

Eyes peeled!
On the other side!

Move it, lads.
Follow me.

Down on the sand!

Over here!

This way.

Is he breathing?

He's alive.

Alert the Queen!

You lead, mate.
Go quickly, lads.

Back to the castle.

Go ahead.

Go, let's go!

Let's go.

<i>â™ª I don't know when</i>

<i>â™ª I don't know how</i>

<i>â™ª But I know something's</i>
<i>Starting right now</i>

<i>â™ª Watch and you'll see</i>

<i>â™ª Someday I'll be</i>

<i>â™ª Part of your world â™ª</i>

No.

No, it's too easy.

She's already in love
with the human world

and now she found
her soulmate.

Ugh.

Oh, wait until
Daddy finds out.

He's gonna
hit the surface.

That little girl's
gonna run straight

into my tentacles.

Then I'll use her
as a prawn
in my little game

and finally get to rip
the power away from Triton

that should've been
mine all along.

All right.

Okay.

As long as the King
never finds out,

everything will be
all right.

He never has
to know she used

that precious siren song
of hers to save a human.

I just have to find Ariel
and get her back home.

Now, uh,

she was around
here somewhere.

Uh-huh. Ah, yeah,
this must be it.

I just have to be
firm with her,

get her to see that
this is all just
a passing fad

and in time, she'll forget
all about him.

Ariel!

Sebastian,
how did you find me?

What is all of this?

What are you doin'
with that...

that thing?

Isn't it beautiful?

Look at the longing
in his eyes.

What you know
about longin'?

What is he doin' here?

It's from the shipwreck.

I found him
at Merman's Reef.

And I'll bet
there's so much more.

No, no! Ariel!

Child, get back here.

Ariel!

You have to let go
of this obsession
with humans.

I'm not obsessed.

I may be crusty,
but I'm not blind.

I saw you the night
of the shipwreck.

What?
Your father
wants you to stay

as far away
from them
as possible!

But why?
You know why.

We don't have to be afraid
of them, I know that now.

Sebastian, if you had
just seen it up there.

The ship rode on the wind,

and they filled
the sky with fire.

Okay, okay.
Listen to me.

The human world
is a mess.

Life under the sea
is better

than anything
they got goin' on up there.

<i>â™ª The seaweed</i>
<i>Is always greener</i>

<i>â™ª In somebody else's lake</i>

<i>â™ª You dream about</i>
<i>Going up there</i>

<i>â™ª But that is a big mistake</i>

<i>â™ª Just look at the world</i>
<i>Around you</i>

<i>â™ª Right here</i>
<i>On the ocean floor</i>

<i>â™ª Such wonderful things</i>
<i>Surround you</i>

<i>â™ª What more</i>
<i>Is you lookin' for?</i>

<i>â™ª Under the sea</i>

<i>â™ª Under the sea</i>

<i>â™ª Darling, it's better</i>
<i>Down where it's wetter</i>

<i>â™ª Take it from me</i>

<i>â™ª Up on the shore</i>
<i>They work all day</i>

<i>â™ª Out in the sun</i>

<i>â™ª While we devotin'</i>

Hey, Ariel?

Somebody got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

Oh, don't tell me
Eric is still going on

about this girl
who rescued him.

I'm afraid so.

And the shipwreck.
Any casualties?

None,
Your Majesty.

Well, thank goodness
no lives were lost.

Indeed.

This restless
nature of his,
it concerns me.

Undertaking these
dangerous voyages.

Oh, Eric, sit.

Any sign
of that girl yet,
Grimsby?

Have some
breakfast, please.

Uh, we looked, sire.

There was no girl.

You were lucky
to have made it to shore

before you passed out.

She was real.
She saved my life.

Sit down, Eric.

I'm not hungry, Mother.
I'm worried about you.

You've not been yourself
since the shipwreck.

Have you checked
the neighboring islands?

Not all of them, but...
Then I will.

No, you will not.

You're not leaving this castle
until you're feeling better.

I'll feel better
when I find her.

Do not think
you're using

this girl as an excuse
to run off again,

risking your life
on some trade ship

for the sheer adventure.

"Sheer adventure"?

I'm trying to reach out
to other cultures,

so we don't
get left behind.

Did you know
on this last trip

we traded our cane
for 20 cases of quinine?

They use it in Europe
to treat malaria.

And where are
those 20 cases now?

At the bottom of the sea.

How many shipwrecks
have there been

in our waters this year,
Prime Minister?

Uh, six, Your Majesty.
Did you hear that, Eric?

Of course, I did.
Shipwrecks, hurricanes,

the sea gods
are against us.

How many times
do I have to...

They are eroding
our land
from under us,

stealing it back
into the ocean.

They would kill us all
if they could.

That's ridiculous.

Is it?

May I remind you,
that a deadly shipwreck

first brought you to us.

And now,
I almost lost you
to one the other day.

We cannot keep
tempting fate like this.

It has got to stop.

Well, what does
that mean?

It means that...

that your responsibilities
are here now.

So, no more voyages

and no more chasing
after girls who don't exist.

<i>â™ª All I ever wanted</i>

<i>The horizon line</i>

<i>â™ª And you're finally real</i>
<i>Here beside me</i>

<i>â™ª Now I'm right here</i>
<i>On the shoreline</i>

<i>â™ª I'm right where you left me</i>

<i>â™ª And your voice is like</i>

<i>â™ª A siren that guides me</i>

<i>â™ª To wild uncharted waters</i>

<i>â™ª Alone, just you and me</i>

<i>â™ª And I hope you're there</i>
<i>In the open air</i>

<i>â™ª There's no map or compass</i>
<i>To guide me, no</i>

<i>â™ª Time may change</i>
<i>The shoreline</i>

<i>â™ª But time will not change me</i>

<i>â™ª If it takes my life</i>

<i>â™ª I will finally</i>
<i>Find you again</i>

<i>â™ª In uncharted waters</i>

<i>â™ª Come find me</i>

<i>â™ª Again â™ª</i>

Ariel, could you
give me a hand?

Ariel!

Oh. Yes, of course.

How do
we untangle this?

Do these humans
have any idea

how much damage
their shipwrecks do?

I don't think
they intended
to have a shipwreck.

They are careless,
Ariel.

It will take
thousands of years

for this coral
to grow back.

And they've killed
nearly all
of the sea fern.

They'd kill us too,
if they had the chance.

No, no.
They're not
all like that.

Oh?
How would you know?

You've never
even seen one.

You were just a child
when Mother died,

and Father stopped us going
to the surface.

I just mean,
we're not all the same,

so why should humans be?

What about humans?

I... I just meant...

Look at what
their shipwreck did.

They got
what they deserved.

They are the most
dangerous species of all.

Spoiling our waters,

destroying the reefs,

having no respect
for the balance
of the oceans.

They're not
the only ones

who have no respect
for balance.

Ariel,
where are you...

What's going on with her?

Oh, she's just
at that age

when she doesn't want
to hang out

with her older sisters
anymore.

Exactly. You remember
what I was like.

How could we forget?

Well, I wonder
who the lucky merman is.

The crab, Your Majesty.

Come over here,
Sebastian.

Breathe, Sebastian.

Remember,
guilty is as guilty acts.

Don't overreact,
remain calm.

Yes?

Yes, Your Majesty?

Sebastian,

have you noticed

that Ariel has been
acting peculiar lately?

Peculiar, sir?

Mm-hmm.
Distracted, daydreaming,

disappearing for hours.

You haven't noticed?

Oh... Well, I, um...

Uh...

Uh, I actually haven't,
you know, um...

that is to say,
I didn't, um...

Sebastian...
Eh?

I know you've been keeping
something from me.

Keepin' somethin'?
Mm-hmm.

About Ariel.

Ariel?

Is my little one in love?

Oh, I tried
to stop her, sir!

I tried to stop her
from going to the surface!

I told her to stay away
from humans!

Humans?
When I saw her

with that statue, I...
Humans?

Who said anything
about humans?

Let's just drop
these things off and go back.

No way!

With all that great
stuff still down there?

Don't we have
enough already?

Come on, Flounder.

We're just getting started.

So...

You broke the rules?

You went
to the above world.

There was a shipwreck.

A man was drowning.
I had to save him.

You should have
let him drown.

They're savages.

You don't know that.

They killed your mother.

I know.

But...

one man did.

Why blame every human?

Mother wouldn't.
No!

Enough. That's enough.

And Eric
had nothing
to do with it.

Eric?

Eric?

Have you lost
your senses completely?

If you would have
just heard him, Father.

He's compassionate
and kind and...

He's a human!

You're a mermaid!
Yes.

But that doesn't
make us enemies.

Promise me
you will never look
for him again.

I can't.
Promise me, Ariel!

I can't lie to you.
I won't.

I swear,
I will get
through to you!

No!

Please!

Father, stop.

This ends now!

Please, stop it!

It's for your own good.

Father, no!

Never leave again.

Ariel.

I'm...

Just go away.

Poor child.

Poor sweet child.

He can be so angry.

He thinks
he knows everything.

Who are you?

Oh.
You must not remember me.

I'm your Auntie Ursula.

The Sea Witch?

The what?

What has your father
told you about me?

That...

That you like
to stir up trouble

between humans
and merpeople.

Oh.
Is that what he said?

I'm not half the monster
he claims I am.

And I'm only here to help.

I don't need your help.

Whatever you say, darling.

Wait.
Yes?

How can you help me?

Ariel?

Where is she going

with those slippery
good-for-nothin's?

Let's go.

Come in.

Come in, child.

We mustn't lurk
in passageways.

It's rude.

Forgive my aggressive garden.

I wouldn't choose
to live like this,
believe me.

Daddy's been so unfair
to both of us,

controlling everything
we say and do.

In a way,
we're the same,
you and I.

You don't seem at all
like Father described you.

Is that right?

Mmm. We never did get along.

Squidling rivalry.

He always got what he wanted,
and what did I get? Nothin'.

Zip, nada, squat.

Sound familiar, hon?

Oh, I know what you're
going through, believe me,

and I know
why you're here.

I'm not sure I do.

Oh, please.

I've been watching you
for a long time now, dearie.

What you really want
is to be up there

in the above world.

It's always
had your curiosity,

and now
it's got your heart.

What do you mean?

You're so young.

Don't you see?

You're meant
for each other.

And I can't bear
to see you
suffer like this.

As it happens,
I can help you.

How?

Mmm, the problem
is simple.

You can't live
in that world,
unless...

you become
a human yourself.

Become human?

Is that even possible?

Oh, my dear.

It's what I do.

It's what I live for.

<i>â™ª I admit that in the past</i>
<i>I've been a nasty</i>

<i>â™ª They weren't kidding</i>
<i>When they called me</i>

<i>â™ª Well, a witch</i>

<i>â™ª But you'll find</i>
<i>That nowadays</i>

<i>â™ª I've mended all my ways</i>

<i>â™ª Repented, seen the light</i>
<i>And made a switch</i>

<i>â™ª True? Yes</i>

<i>â™ª And I fortunately know</i>
<i>A little magic</i>

<i>â™ª It's a talent</i>
<i>That I always</i>
<i>Have possessed</i>

<i>â™ª And here lately</i>
<i>Please don't laugh</i>

<i>â™ª I use it on behalf</i>

<i>â™ª Of the miserable, lonely</i>
<i>And depressed</i>

<i>â™ª Pathetic</i>

<i>â™ª Poor unfortunate souls</i>

<i>â™ª In pain, in need</i>

<i>â™ª This one longing</i>
<i>To be thinner</i>

<i>â™ª That one wants</i>
<i>To get the girl</i>

<i>â™ª And do I help them?</i>

<i>â™ª Yes, indeed</i>

<i>â™ª Those poor unfortunate souls</i>

<i>â™ª So sad, so true</i>

<i>â™ª They come flocking</i>
<i>To my cauldron</i>

<i>â™ª Crying</i>
<i>"Spells, Ursula, please!"</i>

<i>â™ª And I help them?</i>

<i>â™ª Yes, I do</i>

<i>â™ª Now, it's happened</i>
<i>Once or twice</i>

<i>â™ª Someone couldn't</i>
<i>Pay the price</i>

<i>â™ª And I'm afraid I had</i>
<i>To rake 'em 'cross the coals</i>

<i>â™ª Yes, I've had</i>
<i>The odd complaint</i>

<i>â™ª But on the whole</i>
<i>I've been a saint</i>

<i>â™ª To those poor</i>
<i>Unfortunate souls</i>

The Sea Witch!
Shh.

So, here's the deal.

I'll whip up
a little potion

to make you human
for three days.

Got that?

Three days.

Before the sun sets
on the third day,

you and Princey
must share a kiss.

And not just any kiss.

The kiss of true love.

If you do,
you will remain
human permanently.

But if you don't,

you'll turn back
into a mermaid,

and you belong to me.

No, Ariel!
Shh.

You understand,
of course,

that you'll have
to give up
your mermaid gifts.

You won't have
this tail of yours,

hangin' around,
draggin' you down.

You won't be able
to breathe underwater,
who needs it?

And you'll no longer have
that siren song of yours,

because that
wouldn't be fair,
now would it?

Don't worry.

I'll keep it safe
and soundless here with me.

We got a deal?

I don't know.

Well...

I mean, I just gave you
the premium package, kid.

Well...

life's full
of tough choices,
idn't?

No.

This is wrong.
I can't do this.

Fine then,
forget about
the world above.

Go back home
to Daddy

and "Never leave again!"

<i>â™ª Come on</i>
<i>You poor unfortunate soul!</i>

<i>â™ª Go ahead</i>

<i>â™ª Make your choice</i>

<i>â™ª I'm a very busy woman</i>

<i>â™ª And I haven't got all day</i>

<i>â™ª It won't cost much</i>
<i>Just your voice</i>

<i>â™ª You poor unfortunate soul</i>

<i>â™ª It's sad, but true</i>

<i>â™ª If you want to cross</i>
<i>The bridge, my sweet</i>

<i>â™ª You've got to pay the toll</i>

<i>â™ª Pluck a scale</i>
<i>From off your tail</i>

<i>â™ª A drop of blood</i>
<i>Inside the bowl!</i>

<i>â™ª Flotsam, Jetsam</i>
<i>Now I've got her, boys</i>

<i>â™ª For boss is on a roll!</i>

<i>â™ª This poor unfortunate...</i>

<i>â™ª Soul!</i>

<i>â™ª Beluga! Sevruga!</i>
<i>Come winds of the Caspian Sea!</i>

<i>â™ª Amnesia, glossitis</i>
<i>Et max laryngitis</i>

<i>â™ª La voce to me! â™ª</i>

Now sing!

Keep singing!

Whoa!

Yes!

Yes!

Look at her stupid
little feet!

Oh, Ariel.

Well,
come on, gal.

It's either sink
or swim.

Don't worry, boys.

She doesn't stand
a chance without this.

A mermaid
without her voice?

And just in case,

I slipped a little somethin'
extra into that spell of mine.

No matter how hard
that girl tries,

she won't remember
she needs to get that kiss.

Now it's just
a matter of time.

And then she's mine.

Hmm.

Not so easy
without your tail, is it?

Keep going.

You just got
to get your sea legs.

We're almost there.

Get away from here!

Lord have mercy.

Are you all right?

Ah, poor girl.

You must be in shock.

I'll go find something
to cover you up.

Another shipwreck.

<i>Santa Maria.</i>

Say, what's goin' on, kid?

I thought
you weren't supposed
to be up here,

now you're taking
boat rides?

That... That...
That rotten Sea Witch,

she stole Ariel's voice.

Hey, Flounder.

What... What are you
talkin' about?

So, Sebastian told Triton
that Ariel saved a human

and Triton got so mad.
Okay, okay, okay.

And then... Wait!
Explanations later, man.

We've gotta get you
out of here.

Wait! I didn't tell you
about the Sea Witch!

Bye-bye.
And don't tell anyone
about the Sea Witch!

Something about you
seems different.

Don't tell me.

It's your hairdo, right?

'Cause you've been using
the dinglehopper? No?

I can't... I can't
quite figure it out,

but I know that if I stand
here for long enough...

She got legs,
ya idiot!

You know,
we've discussed this.

I don't like it
when you call me an idiot.

Why don't you tell me
somethin' nice?

"Hey, Scuttle.

"Your feathers look good."
Shoo!

Here you are.

It'll have to do
for now.

I'll take you
to the castle.

They'll know what
to do with you there.

Come on, in ya go.

Good catch today.
It looks good, though.

It looks raw.

You're not done yet?

His looks so good!

I must say a parrie fish.

Got plenty of fish
for two weeks.

Hey!

<i>â™ª Look at the sun and the sky</i>

<i>â™ª And the sand</i>
<i>And the sea</i>
<i>Behind me</i>

<i>â™ª Look at me, suddenly I am</i>
<i>On land and I'm free</i>

<i>â™ª Don't mind me as I climb</i>
<i>For the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Jump for the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Trying to stand</i>

<i>â™ª But this gravity's</i>
<i>Pulling me down</i>

Walk on, Emile.

Trot on!

Trot on!

Get Lashana, quick!

Right-o!

What is all this?

What on Earth?

The girl got tangled
in the net.

She all right?
She'll survive.

But she's been
through it, though.

Won't say a word.

I wonder what happened
to her out there.

<i>â™ª Look, it's a fire</i>

<i>â™ª It's warm and it glows</i>

<i>â™ª And it lights this chamber</i>

<i>â™ª Let me admire it</i>
<i>Ow!</i>

<i>â™ª Get too close and it bites</i>

<i>â™ª I came too close</i>
<i>For the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Burned for the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Everything's clearer</i>
<i>And brighter and hotter</i>

<i>â™ª But now that I'm here</i>
<i>Like a fish out of water</i>

<i>â™ª I'm trying to stand</i>

<i>â™ª But this gravity's</i>
<i>Pulling me down</i>

Oh, my! Heavens.

Here, let me
take you upstairs,

get you cleaned up,
find you some clothes.

Okay, up we go,

one step at a time.

She can't speak at all?

Can you blame her, Rosa?

After all
she's been through,

it's a blessing
she's not worse off.

Such a faraway look
in her eye.

Bit of a soap and a scrub,
she'll be good as new.

<i>â™ª Are we only</i>

<i>â™ª Food for slaughter?</i>

<i>â™ª Is this life on land?</i>

Child,
the blue dress
that's in your room.

<i>- â™ª Well, you were lonely</i>
<i>- Under water</i>

<i>â™ª Come on, Ariel</i>
<i>Time to stand</i>

There you go.
Smells nice, doesn't it?

Oh, no, you poor girl.

You must be starvin'.

Rosa, get this
poor child some food.

And quick,
before she tries
to eat the scrub brush.

Yes, ma'am.
Right.

Let's get that
seaweed stink
off you, girl.

Yes.

<i>â™ª Squeeze in the shoes</i>

<i>â™ª And the corset, it's tight</i>

<i>â™ª And the seams are busting</i>

<i>â™ª Some women choose this</i>
<i>I guess it's all right</i>

<i>â™ª Are my dreams adjusting</i>

Hard to believe,

two shipwrecks
in one week.

Prince Eric's still
looking for that girl
who saved him.

Said he won't rest
until he finds her.

Stay right there.
I'll get the Prince.

<i>â™ª As I wait for the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Here for the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Now, for the first time</i>

<i>â™ª He's coming</i>
<i>Through those doors</i>

<i>â™ª Up the stairs</i>

<i>â™ª From the shore</i>

<i>â™ª From that moment</i>

<i>â™ª And he'll smile</i>

<i>â™ª Like he knows</i>

<i>â™ª When I say</i>

I'm so sorry
to hear what happened.

What's your name?

She doesn't
speak, sire.

She...

Oh.

Well, we're glad
you've made it to us.

Do you have
a place to stay?

Family?

Well, then you're welcome
to stay here.

For as long as you like.

Make sure
she has anything
she needs.

Yes, Your Highness.

We should let you
get some rest.

<i>â™ª Realize</i>
<i>The price that you paid</i>

<i>With your voice</i>

<i>â™ª As he turns from you</i>

<i>â™ª Those sacrifices you made</i>

<i>â™ª Were a choice</i>
<i>That you can't undo</i>

<i>â™ª Lost</i>

<i>â™ª For the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Scared</i>

<i>â™ª For the first time</i>

<i>â™ª Gravity feels like</i>
<i>An undertow</i>

<i>â™ª Pulling me</i>

<i>â™ª Down â™ª</i>

This has got to be,
without a doubt,

the single
most humiliating
day of my life!

I could have
been fricasseed,

and then, having to climb
all the way up here.

They couldn't
give you a room
on the ground floor?

I hope you appreciate

what I go through
for you, young lady.

Eh, no.

Don't ya turn
your back on me.

What were you thinkin',

choosin' to give up
your mermaid gifts?

Now, if we could
just get that witch
to give them back,

then you could
go home
and just be...

uh, well,
and just be...

just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

Oh, my, what a soft shell
I am turnin' out to be.

All right.
All right.

I'll try to help you.

But we've got
to be bold,
act quickly.

Don't forget
about the kiss.

Ah, no, no, not me,
the Prince!

You gotta kiss
the Prince.

Don't you remember?

You only have
three days to...

Hello?

Oh, no!

She's put
a spell on you.

You can't remember,
can you?

Now,
what are we gonna do?

Well, we got
no time to lose.

We just got
to find a way

to get the two
of you together.

You are hopeless, child.

You know that?

Completely hopeless.

Ooh. A buffet.

What? No nuts?

What are you
doin' here?

Oh, there you are.
I've been lookin' for you.

Flounder told me
the whole story.

Has Ariel killed
the Prince yet?

No, not "killed."

"Kissed," ya bird brain.

And it's worse
than we thought.

The witch has placed
a spell on her.

Soon as I tell her
she's got to kiss him,

the thought jumps clear
right out of her head.

So, now it's up to us.

To kiss the Prince?

Forget it.

Where's Ariel now?

What do ya mean?
She's right...

Oh.

What are you doin'
in here, child?

You can't just go wanderin'
around wherever you please.

Hide!
Who's in here?

Oh, it's you.

Nobody usually
comes in here.

My little mermaid.

It's all right,
it's all right.

You can look at it.

I found her
on the coast
of Cartagena.

Isn't she beautiful?

Oh, that's right. You...

Well, it really
doesn't matter.

Most people around here
use too many words

and have nothing to say.

You know,

I never believed
all that lore

about mermaids luring
sailors to their deaths.

Here, take her.

No, really.
I want you to have her.

I'm running
out of space
as it is.

Nearly all of these things
come from my voyages.

I know it must seem silly,
collecting all this stuff,

but just look
at this fossilized
sea stone.

Can you believe
that such amazing things

exist down there?

No, wait!

How did you know
that was in there...

all this time?

That's incredible.

Well, that.
Hey, girl.

That I just picked up
from the beach
here on the island.

There's loads of them
at this time of year.

I had no idea
you could do that.

Oh, me?

No... Oh.

Really?

All right, hand...

How do I...

Yeah, that's it.

That's it, girl.

Go get it,
go get it.

I see ya.

Go on, come now...

Sorry.

Yeah, well...

I'll work on that.

I love the people there.

Their culture,
their custom.

This whole region is known
as the Brazilian Empire.

Then there's Venezuela,

uh, Colombia...

Oh, the area up here
is called Mosquito Coast.

Those waters
are all uncharted.

Wouldn't it be amazing
to discover someplace

no one's ever seen before?

Ah. Well, this...

this was one
of my favorite voyages.

I bought
that Peruvian rug there,

along with six of the looms
they used to make it.

Oh.

Another one.
All right.

Ah. This is our island.

We're in that very castle
right now.

Over here's
our main village.

Now, our port there
was once the busiest
in the region.

I'm hoping
it will be again
one day.

And there's a beautiful lagoon

with a little waterfall
right here.

And then all of that
is rainforest.

I could show you around,
if you like.

All right.

We'll go tomorrow.
But, sire...

Oh, Grimsby, good.

We'll need a horse
and carriage

ready for us
in the morning.

May I have
a quiet word, sire?

Of course.

He's a special one,
isn't he?

And that moonlight. Ah...

We were going to send out
all the carriages tomorrow

to look for the girl.

The girl!
I wasn't thinking.

Of course, yes,
we must do that. Absolutely.

And I must
remind you, Eric,

what your mother
said yesterday

about you not leaving
the castle

until you're
feeling better.
Grimsby, I feel fine.

I feel better
than ever.

Yes.

Yes, I can see that.

I suppose
we could spare
one carriage.

Looks like you made
a friend there.

Come on, Max.

We'll see you later.

Oh, no.
You're not goin'
without me.

I only got
two days left.

I'm a crab
on a mission.

Trot on, King.

I'm getting
too old for this.

Oh, no, no, no!
Down, beast!

Whoa!

I still got it.

Who is that ridin' out
with Prince Eric?

Is that the girl
who washed up
the other day?

Yes, it is, Lashana.

Didn't the Queen tell him
to stay in the castle?

Yes, she did, Lashana.

Aren't you going
to get into trouble

for fetching him
a carriage?

What carriage, Lashana?

Oh.

Do you wanna try?

Here.

Oh!

Um...

Look out! Look out!

Come on!
Move, move, move!

Sorry about that!

That was close.

Whoa!

Hey, guys!
Get out the way!

Turn!
Quickly!

Wait, wait, wait!

Careful!

Oh!

That was...

fun.

Here, I'll...

Let me give you a hand.

Move, move 'em.

Here we go.
This way.

Come on.
This way.

Here we go.

Go on. That's it.

Thank you, lad.

Island berry?

How is it? Pretty?

Whoa!
Coconut!

Breadfruit!
Coconut!

Fresh coconut?

No? You don't want it?

Get some water in ya.

Thank you, Miss.
Young lady,

would you like
to try some?

Oh!

I think you'll be
needing this.

Hey,
can I have some salt?

Good day, sire.

How ripe the mango?

Hat for the lady?

Oh.
There you are.

Oh.
No, no. Too big.

Try this.

Tropical flowers?

Hey!
Everybody, everybody!

Hey, hey, hey!

Hey!

Say, any kissing yet?

No. When it comes
to romance,

these two
are slow as snails.

Hey, go find Flounder.

We got to move
this thing along,
and quick.

Okay, bossy.

Hey!

Hey!

Bring it here,
bring it here,
bring it here now!

Back it up,
back it up,
back it up!

Come on, now!

I love this
time of night.

Sometimes you'll see
the eyes of a screech owl,

up in the tree...

Hey! Hey!

Hey, come back
with that!

Come on.

Watch out.

I think
it went this way.

You all right?
Hey!

Give me my hat back!

Oh. All right then.

I didn't want
to lose this.

Move your big
fat feathers, bird.

I can't see a thing.

Well, that worked
pretty good,
didn't it?

But nothing's happening.

We're running out of time,
and no one's puckered up once.

I think it's time
for a little

vocal romantic
stimulation.

Please, no.

Scuttle?
You got to be...
<i>â™ª Me, me, me</i>

<i>â™ª Womp chicka womp womp</i>

<i>â™ª Chicka womp womp</i>
Shh!

<i>â™ª Chicka womp</i>

<i>â™ª Womp womp</i>

All right. Gosh.
<i>â™ª Womp</i>

I was off.
I was off on that one.

No.
<i>â™ª Womp</i>

Let me find it.
Let me find it.

<i>â™ª Womp</i>
Ya finish?

<i>â™ª Womp â™ª</i>

All right,
all right.
Listen.

Ariel cannot know
we're helpin'.

If she sees or hears us,
she'll shut us down.

Nah, man.
We got to be
sneaky about this.

We got to work
on the Prince

using the power
of suggestion.

Good.

How are we gonna do that?

We got to blend in
with the sounds of nature,

so she doesn't hear us.

Percussion.

Strings.

Winds.

Words.

<i>â™ª There you see her</i>

<i>â™ª Sitting there</i>
<i>Across the way</i>

<i>â™ª She don't got a lot to say</i>

<i>â™ª But there's something</i>
<i>About her</i>

<i>â™ª And you don't know why</i>

<i>â™ª But you're dying to try</i>

<i>â™ª You wanna</i>
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Yes, you want her</i>

<i>â™ª Look at her</i>
<i>You know you do</i>

<i>â™ª Possible she wants you, too</i>

<i>â™ª Use your words, boy</i>
<i>And ask her</i>

Do you want to try?

<i>â™ª If the time is right</i>

<i>â™ª Then the time is tonight</i>

<i>â™ª Go on and kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Sha la la la la la</i>
<i>My oh, my</i>

<i>â™ª Look like</i>
<i>The boy too shy</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't gonna kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Sha la la la la la</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't that sad</i>

<i>â™ª Ain't it a shame, too bad</i>

<i>â™ª He's gonna miss the girl</i>

Hey, pull it back.

Scuttle, pull it back.

What a clear night.

You can see Orion.

Oh, the... The sailors
use the constellations
to navigate.

That one's Orion,
the hunter.

There's Aries,
the ram.

That's Cassiopeia.

That's funny.

I still don't know
your name.

Let's see.
Is it...

Diana?

No?

Or...

Katherine?

No, definitely
not Katherine.

How...

Sky...

Uh...

Aries?

Aries.

Arie...

Ari-el.

Ariel?

Ari-el?

Ariel.

That's a beautiful name.

Written in the stars.

<i>â™ª Now's your moment</i>

<i>â™ª Ooh, ooh-ooh</i>
<i>â™ª Floating in a blue lagoon</i>

<i>â™ª Ooh-ooh, boy, do it soon</i>
<i>â™ª Boy, you better do it soon</i>

<i>â™ª No time will be better</i>

<i>â™ª She don't say a word</i>

<i>â™ª And she won't</i>
<i>Say a word</i>
<i>Until you</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Sha la la la la</i>

<i>â™ª Don't be scared</i>

<i>â™ª You got the mood prepared</i>

<i>â™ª Go on and kiss the girl</i>
<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Wow, wow</i>
<i>â™ª Sha la la la la la</i>

<i>â™ª Don't stop now</i>

<i>â™ª Don't try to hide it</i>
<i>How you wanna</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Sha la la la la la</i>

<i>â™ª Float along</i>

<i>â™ª And listen to the song</i>

<i>â™ª The song say</i>

<i>â™ª "Kiss the girl"</i>

<i>â™ª Sha la la la la la</i>

<i>â™ª The music play</i>

<i>â™ª Do what the music say</i>

Oh!
<i>â™ª You gotta</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª You gotta</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Why don't you</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Come on and</i>
<i>â™ª Kiss the girl</i>

<i>â™ª Go on and</i>

<i>â™ª Kiss the girl â™ª</i>

What...
What was that?

That was close.

Too close.

I don't get it.

I didn't think that little
barracuda stood a chance

luring him in
without her voice.

How's that
even possible?

Well, we're not gonna
let that happen again.

It's time Ursula
took matters
into her own tentacles.

Where is it?

Come on, come on.
It's gotta be
here somewhere.

No! No!

Nobody ever puts
my things back!

No! Where is it?

No, no, no!

No!

Oh, there it is.

I got it.

That Prince won't know
what hit him.

Only one more sunset

and then I'll make
Triton writhe.

I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook.

So where is she?

We don't know, Father.
She's gone.

What do you mean,
she's gone?

We've been
looking and looking.

There's no sign
of her anywhere.

She's not
in these waters.
Then look again.

Search all
of the Seven Seas
if you have to.

Ariel wouldn't dare
go above again.

Don't even think
such a thing.

Doesn't make sense.
Why would she leave?

I...
I have no idea.

Never mind that.
Just find her.

What have I done?

Everyone's asleep.

We should
probably be quiet.
In his room,

all day?
Wait.

Go. Oh, no.
I haven't seen him once.

Go, go.
Go in there.
Go. Careful.

I imagine
he's just resting.

Has he been
avoiding me?

No, Your Majesty.

No?
No.

No?
No.

You seem
awfully certain.

Avoiding you?

Doesn't seem like Eric,
does it?

Then where is he?

Oh, he's not searching
for that fantasy girl,
I hope.

No,
Your Majesty.

That I can say
with certainty.

Thank heavens
for small blessings.

Oh!

It's wet.

I will look
into it.

You really must get
some rest yourself.

Yes,
I suppose I should.

Thank you, Grimsby.
Good night.

Ma'am.

Sorry about that.

I wasn't supposed
to leave the castle today.

But I'm glad I did.

All these rules...

The truth is,
I wasn't born
to all this,

and it all
makes me feel
a little uneasy...

Welcome back, sire.
Oh, Grimsby.

Uh...

Uh...

I trust you two had
a pleasant outing.

Uh, yes, we did.
Didn't we?

Yes.
Very nice.

You've had
a long day, Miss.

I imagine we should
let you get some sleep.

And perhaps
dried off as well.

Oh, uh... Yes.

We... We took
a rowboat out
onto the lagoon,

and I'm afraid
we ended up in it.

Anyway,
good night.

Oh.

Good night...

Ariel.

About the carriages, sire,

I'm afraid they, uh,

didn't find
the mystery girl.

They didn't?

Oh.

May I then ask,

should we continue
the search?

Grimsby, um...

I just...

I feel a little...

Well, if you
want the advice
of an old man, sire,

don't be held back
by what you think
should be.

Think only of what is.

Good night, sire.

Hey! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

What?

<i>â™ª Hey, have you</i>
<i>Not heard the scuttlebutt?</i>

Your butt?

<i>â™ª No, the gossip, the buzz</i>

<i>â™ª The who-said-what-</i>
<i>who-does-that</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, the scuttlebutt</i>

<i>â™ª Well, I was flying</i>
<i>Over land and sea</i>

<i>â™ª An ear to the ground</i>

<i>â™ª Then I came flying here</i>
<i>For you to see</i>

<i>â™ª And hear what I found</i>

<i>â™ª Remember the swamp?</i>

<i>â™ª Remember my song</i>
<i>In the swamp</i>
<i>When I was like</i>

<i>â™ª "Womp chicka womp womp</i>
<i>Chicka womp womp"</i>

I remember.

<i>â™ª Well, ever since</i>

<i>â™ª The what's his name?</i>

<i>â™ª The guy with the hair</i>
<i>And the shirt</i>

The Prince.
<i>â™ª Yeah, the Prince</i>

<i>â™ª Has been dropping hints</i>
<i>He wants to</i>

<i>â™ª You know when humans</i>

<i>â™ª Dress all nice</i>
<i>Like they're penguins?</i>

<i>â™ª Throw rice for the pigeons?</i>

<i>â™ª They're trying to blow up</i>
<i>The pigeons</i>

<i>â™ª But those are</i>
<i>Just urban legends</i>

<i>â™ª I know a lot</i>
<i>Of really fat pigeons</i>

Scuttle...

<i>â™ª Will you Just listen,</i>
<i>Sebastian?</i>

<i>â™ª I got the scuttlebutt</i>
Hurry up.

<i>â™ª You'll be like, "What?"</i>
<i>When I drop that scuttlebutt</i>

<i>â™ª Okay, now</i>
<i>Huddle up, buttercup</i>

<i>â™ª From the women</i>
<i>Who wash all the clothes</i>

<i>â™ª To the hunter</i>
<i>Who arrows the bows</i>

<i>â™ª The chatter</i>
<i>All over the palace</i>

<i>â™ª Is that your Prince Eric</i>

<i>â™ª Is gonna propose</i>
What?

<i>â™ª To somebody nobody knows</i>

<i>â™ª They're saying</i>
<i>He suddenly chose</i>

Who?
<i>â™ª Who?</i>

<i>â™ª You sound like an owl</i>
<i>I'll bet it's the kid</i>

<i>â™ª With the new set of toes</i>
No!

<i>â™ª Oh, yes, anything goes</i>
<i>Who'd ever guess</i>

<i>â™ª Our little Ariel's</i>
<i>Marriage material?</i>

<i>â™ª Time for the rice</i>
<i>And the dress</i>

<i>â™ª And the what</i>
<i>Do you call it?</i>

<i>â™ª The thing with the lips</i>
<i>When they press</i>

<i>â™ª I don't have lips</i>
<i>I have a beak</i>

<i>â™ª So I guess</i>
<i>I could give you</i>
<i>A peck on the cheek</i>

I don't believe it.

Say,
you're awfully quiet.

Oh, yeah.
So, uh, what now?

Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!

<i>- â™ª Can you believe</i>
<i>- The scuttlebutt?</i>

Get dressed, child.

<i>- â™ª You're welcome</i>
<i>- For the scuttlebutt</i>

We got
a lot of work to do
before sundown.

<i>â™ª The s-s-s-s-scuttlebutt</i>
<i>Scuttlebutt, hey!</i>

Oh, please
let this be the day.

<i>â™ª Let's go,</i>
<i>let's go, let's go</i>
<i>â™ª Let's go</i>

<i>â™ª We got it, the gossip</i>
<i>The buzz</i>

<i>â™ª The who-said-what-</i>
<i>who-does-that</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, I told you so</i>
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go</i>

<i>â™ª We gotta go</i>
<i>Before the sun goes down</i>

<i>â™ª What? Got to get her ready</i>

<i>â™ª For the big showdown</i>
<i>â™ª Right</i>

<i>â™ª Go ahead and get her</i>
<i>Out of bed</i>

<i>â™ª And get her ready</i>
<i>For the wedding</i>

<i>â™ª Sun is setting</i>
<i>So we can't slow down</i>

<i>â™ª The scuttlebutt â™ª</i>

Scuttle,
you're too close.

Oh!

My goodness,
it is wonderful news.

Isn't it, Grimsby?
Oh, yes.

I must admit,
I was mistaken.

It seems you really
have found

the girl of your dreams
after all.

Yes.

Quite the surprise,
Eric.

What?

Oh. Uh, I know.

I know
it must seem fast,

but...
but I do owe her
my life.

We will celebrate.

This evening.

You shall introduce
your intended to the court.

We can make that happen,
can't we, Grimsby?

Yes.

If it's really
what you want, Eric.

What I... want?

It's...

It's what we both want.

Lovely.

Well,
we've got our work
cut out for us.

Mm-hmm. Indeed.

Then let's
begin preparations.
Grimsby...

Oh, Ariel, girl.

Where have you gone?

Yeah.
Any sign of her?
No luck.

I flew over the village
three times.

Well, check
the castle again!

It's almost sunset.
We got to find her.

Copy that.

What's wrong
with that fool Prince?

Something fishy
going on here.
I don't like

the smell of it...
Sebastian!

Over here.
Yeah, what?

I coming,
I coming. Hold on.

Yes, what?

I think I know
where Ariel is.

Well, what are
we waiting for?

Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!

Ariel?

So long, Red.

Oh, no!

<i>â™ª Risking it all</i>

<i>â™ª Only to fall</i>

<i>â™ª Back where I started</i>

<i>â™ª Back near the shore</i>

<i>â™ª Back to before</i>

<i>â™ª You took my hand</i>

<i>â™ª Bet ya on land</i>

<i>â™ª They understand</i>

<i>â™ª And they don't</i>
<i>Strand you brokenhearted</i>

<i>â™ª What did I give to live</i>
<i>Where you are?</i>

<i>â™ª Where do I go</i>
<i>With nowhere to turn to? â™ª</i>

Hey,
what are you doin', child?

You can't give up
so easily.

This all has to be
some sort
of misunderstanding.

I watched
both of you.

You're meant
to be together.

There you are.
I've been lookin'.

And I... And I thought
I found you,
'cause I heard.

But... But then
I saw it wasn't you.

It... It was her!

But...
But it wasn't...

In the mirror,
except she had...

She had your voice!

What are you
talkin' about?

Don't you get
what I'm tellin' you?

No!
The Prince
has been tricked.

That lady
who showed up

is actually
the Sea Witch
in disguise.

Are you sure
about this?

Of course I'm sure!

Have I ever
been wrong?

I mean, like,
you know,
when it counts?

Well, what are we
gonna do?

Well, we have
to do something

before Prince Eric ends up
with that slimy squid.

Yes, girl, go!

Flounder,
go tell the Sea King
what's happened.

He has
to know everything.

Okay.
Oh...

What do I... What...
What do I do?

You give me a lift
to the castle.

We got to find a way
to stall that engagement.

Really is very special.

Heroism's too strong
a word for it,

but I suppose
I did save Eric.

That's what
anyone would do.
Of course.

Grimsby.
Sire.

Have you seen Ariel?

According to the servants,

she left the castle
early this morning.

Left?

Can you
blame her, Eric?

I don't understand.
This is not like you.

I'm not sure
I understand it myself.

I just wanted to...

I thought if...
Eric.

Thank you.

I don't really know
what I wanted.

Almost there!

Now, when I give
the signal,
you drop me!

Got it?
Got it.

No, you idiot...

Guess I'm on my own.

My darling,

this belonged
to my mother.

And I'd like you
to have it.

Your happiness means
everything to me.

You're very sweet, um...

Uh, would you excuse me?

Enjoy yourself.

Oh, Eric.

It's beautiful.

What in the...
The ring.

The ring. I lost...

Has anybody
seen the ring?

Have you seen
the ring?

Have you seen it?

Get off me,
you filthy bird!

Help me!
I'm being attacked!

Ariel! Ariel,
I've been
looking for you.

Who is that?

What are you doing?

Grimsby,
let me go!
Sire!

Get her
away from me!

She's insane!

What's going on?

Ariel, stop!

Get off!

Ariel.

Yes.

It was you all along.

I should've known.

I don't know
what came over me.

She bewitched you.

Get away from her!

Eric, I want you
to know I...

Oh, just kiss!

I want you
to know everything.

Nothing matters now.

No!

Oh, good Lord.
She's a sea creature.

You're too late!

You're too late!

Stay back!

Shut up!

Eric!

Eric, no.

This is the work
of the sea gods.

I warned you.

Their whole
world is evil.

Eric, wait! Eric!

What are you doing?
Let go of me!

Not a chance.
You made a deal,
remember?

Three days, no kiss.

Yeah,
is it all comin'
back to ya?

I thought so.

Well, now
you gotta live
with it, toots.

Ursula!

Let her go.

Forget it,
Big Brother.

She belongs
to me now.

Oh, you see?

We made a deal.

In blood.

It's unbreakable,
even for you.

I'm sorry, Father.
This is all my fault.

What do you want
with my daughter?

Oh.

Nothing.

It's you I want.

I want to see
you suffer,

like I've suffered
all these years.

And the daughter
of the great Sea King

is a very
precious commodity.

Oh, poor,
unfortunate soul.

Hey!
Get her, boys!

Uh-uh.
I wouldn't.

Shocking,
isn't it?

Of course,
I always was a gal

with an eye
for a bargain.

What do you say
to a trade, hmm?

What's your precious
little Ariel worth to ya?

It's mine now.

No!

Father!

You...

You monster!

Don't be a fool,
you little brat!

You are powerless against...

You're gonna
pay for that.

Get him!

Say goodbye
to your human heartthrob.

Don't!

Ahh!

My babies!

Eric!

Get to shore.
She'll kill you!

I'm not leaving you!

Yes!

Give me your hand!

Now!

Look out!

Now I rule the seas

and all will be helpless
under my power!

No!

So much for true love.

So long, lover boy.

You gave
your life for me.

And you fought
to get my life back.

I didn't fight
alone, Father.

Eric was with me.

All that matters now
is that you're safe
and home.

Where you belong.

Sire, please!
We need a boat.

Grimsby,
we have
to find her!

And then what?

And then
what, Eric?

Darling.

You were right.

I was chasing
after a fantasy girl.

No. No,
I was wrong.

She was very real.

And so were
your feelings for her,
I see that now.

It's just that...

our worlds
were never meant
to be together.

Sebastian!

You gotta be
kidding me.

Yes,
Your Majesty.

I have always tried to do
what's best for our people.

Yes,
Your Majesty.

And what's best
for my daughters.

Indeed,
Your Majesty.

And I've done everything
in my power

to make her happy.

Well, not quite.

She wants
a different life

than I had
planned for her.

She did try
to tell you, Your Majesty.

But I won't be able
to protect her anymore.

Well, it's like
I always say,

children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

Oh, is that what
you always say?

Somethin' like that.
Yeah.

Then there's just
one problem left.

And what's that,
Your Majesty?

How much I'm going
to miss my little one.

Good boy.
Go on.

Again?

Max?

Blessings
to you both.

Magical news, yeah.

Oh, what's all this,
Grims?

Oh, the Queen wanted
the two of you

to have
a proper
send-off, sire.

Thank you,
Your Majesty.

No. Thank you.

Much as
I hate farewells,

we still have cause
to celebrate.

Our worlds have
misunderstood one another
for far too long.

Your marriage marks
a new beginning for us.

Yes. A beginning.

Now,

get out there

and change the world,

or whatever it is
you have to do,

so we don't
get left behind.

That doesn't sound
like my mother.

What have you
done with her?
Oh!

Off you go.

Have you decided
where you're
headed first?

Uncharted waters.

Okay!

A mermaid and a man.

Whoever would
have imagined?

Well, look who's here.

We got you
something, Ariel.
Sure did.

Something
you almost lost.

Where...
Where is it?

You're sittin'
on it, bird.

Ow!

My little mermaid.

Keep her for me.

I hope she causes you
less trouble than I did.

I was right about
the dinglehopper,
wasn't I?

Yes, you were, Scuttle.
You were.

You won't
be gone too long,

will you, Ariel?
Of course not.

I'll be back
by the next Coral Moon.

Yeah, don't be
late this time.

You ready?

Yes.

Yes, I'm ready.

My child.

Eric.

Thank you
for hearing me.

You shouldn't have had
to give up your voice

to be heard.

But now I am listening.

And I will always
be here for you.

We all will.

I love you, Father.
