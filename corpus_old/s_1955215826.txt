I do not want to be weak.

Not having the strength to stand up
and touch my feet above the ground.

I do not want to be morbid.

I'm most afraid of.

Life seeps out of me
like steam from a locomotive.

Wheels moving so slowly.

Until they finally stops spinning at all.

It's hard to think of something that lasts forever
, which continues without end.

But love...
I know that love is endless.

I will love after death.
As my mother still loves me.

Up, Alice. You're going to school today.
I do not want to go to school.

We have just moved here. Do you want to acquire
new friends, you have to go to school.

You have to go to school every day.
You know that.

You must walk today, and the next day, and the next
. It will not escape.

Catholic !

My dad says that
you are whores of Babylon!

Hush!
Translation: gengmovie.com

I do not ask again.

The tags Queen.

Who did this?

Who did this?

If we are going to heaven when we die,
we will return to earth...

-... And see what the future holds?
No.

Do not know if I want to get stuck in the sky
and never see the sea and the forest again.

You do not see them
if you are in heaven.

Why not?
Do not know. But you do not.

Angels will not return from the sky?
There are angels. But you are not one.

Far from it. Maybe you could answer the question
if you pay attention in school.

I'm as good a student as the other.
I just daydreaming.

Your dreams will give you
problems. Father pays your private school.

You could at least learn something.
It's summer now.

I want to forget about school and come
remember what it's like to sit in the sun.

Sure. Do as you want.
As usual.

Do you think we've been here long enough?
For what?

We moved here a few months ago
and I have not met anyone yet.

Except my classmates.
I can just hang out with the church.

Protestants like us
not at all and they are many more than we do.

Was it because the boy yelled at me
on the way to school yesterday?

Father McAvoy talked about
radical ideas and new ways to have old traditions.

And how we would not let
the insane become the fÃ¶rnuftiga-

Or lie become the truth.
But I want to meet new people.

I want to hear new ideas and
meet the strange and eccentric.

I want to meet the people who
change the world, to those seen in movies.

You would not have to go to the cinema.
We might not have been here long enough.

Let's see, we've been here...
three months.

So, yes, it is time that you hit
new and exciting people.

Are you patronizing towards me?
What?

Condescending. That means...
I know what it means.

Are you patronizing towards me?
Of course not.

Or maybe a little.
Well then.

When would you like some tea?
I am tired of the condescending treatment.

If for a moment. You can brew it myself
if you want. The drums are in the basket.

Where is my teacup?
How should I know, Alice?

It's not here.
It must be left somewhere.

Perhaps the home. I'll get it.

I said I'll get it.
Do what you must.

In the golden afternoon
we slide off the front

For small hands usually
cleverly our oars.

While little hands in vain
pretend to guide us.

Ah, cruel Three!
At such time, the dreamy weather

To tell about breathing
so weak that the slightest spring not sway.

What can a lonely voice
against the three conspirators tongues?

Mighty Prima flashes his edict
"to initiate it."

In milder tones hope Secunda;
"It is not to mean."

While Tertia interrupts only
story once every minute.

Oh no, I'm late! I must go.
Goodbye, Miss. I'm too late.

Anon, to sudden silence won.
In the imagination seeking the dream child.

On the way through the country with the,
wild and new.

Wait, sir! What's your name?

And when history wiped out
imagination kÃ¤llor-

And slightly strained
that the substance put away.

Can you stop and say who you are?

"Vila next time..."
"Next time is now", happy voices shouted!

Sir, I beg you to stay!
Can you stay?

Oh dear, I can not place where.

What are you talking about?
Of course, you can not place where.

It is a rabbit hole.

So grew the history of the country.
Slowly, one by one.

Its strange events were forged,
and now the saga finished and homes we manage.

A happy bunch, during sunset.
Alice!

Have a fairy tale and put it with gentle
place where childhood dreams tvinnas-

In memory mysterious band,
as pilgrims withered flowers-

-plockade In remote country.

Drink Me.

Wow, so strange everything is today.
And yesterday everything seemed normal.

I wonder if I changed person during the night?
Let me think.

I felt like the same
When I woke up this morning?

I think I felt a little different.

But if I'm not the same,
Who in the world am I?

I'm not Ada,
for her hair is curly.

I have no attracts all.

I can not be Mabel,
because I know a lot of things.

And she knows so very little.

And besides, she's she, and I'm me.

Everything is so confusing.

I must have been changed to Mabel.
I have to stay in that narrow house-

And hardly have any friends
and have so much I have to learn.

No. I have decided.

If I'm Mabel, I stop down here.

It will do no good if they protrude
their heads and say "come up again."

I just look up and say:
"Who am I?"

"Say it, and I like to be that person
I come up."

"If not, I'll stay down here
until I'm somebody else."

I wish they look in here.
I'm so tired of being alone.

The loneliness is strange.

On the one hand, the solitude be
a terrible cross to bear.

That leaves someone in a lasting
state of isolation and independence.

On the other hand, solitude us
chance to explore our thoughts.

What have you thought about, Alice?

I think I'll go now.
Do you?

Nothing to be afraid of, Alice.

You've met my brother?
The man with the white shoes.

He has led you very far down.

Some of us should be down here.

And some will not!

I think it's time for you
to go back, Alice.

Take my hand.
I do not want to.

We do not always get what we want!

Sit down, everyone.

I'll soon have dried up.

You look all set out.

This is the driest I know.
Be silent all of us now.

William the Conqueror,
whose cause was supported by pÃ¥ven-

And Englishmen,
in need of leaders, subject signal

As they recently had been subjected
too many intrusions and conquests.

Edwin and Morcar,
earls of Mercia and Northumbria...

Excuse me? Did you speak?
Not me.

I thought you did it.

I continue.
Translation: gengmovie.com

Edwin and Morcar,
earls of Mercia and Northumbria-

-stÃ¶dde Him and even Stigand-

The
patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it wise...

"Found it?"
Found it. Of course.

Do you know what that means?
I know that.

When I find something, it is usually a
pretty girl or a nice bottle of booze.

The question is, what did the archbishop?

William behaved calmly first.

But his standard anders insolence...

How are you, darling?

I'm as wet.
This dries me.

When I suggest that the meeting be adjourned
for immediate adoption...

-... Of more energetic remedies.
Speak English!

I do not understand half of those
long words and it does not either.

What I meant to say is that the best
drying way is a political contest.

What is it?

A sort of exercise, but the best way to explain
is to do it.

Lost?

You scared me when you're sitting in the tree.
It was not the answer to my question.

Lost? Are you lost?

I do not really know.

You have to be on your way somewhere to
be lost, and I'm not going anywhere.

You're a fool?
My brothers must think you are lost.

Brothers? You mean he
white shoes and the horrible man with a wool coat?

One and the same, they and me.

You will realize that down here
we are all one and the same.

What do you mean?

Wait! Came back.
Tell me where I should go from here.

I would try opium den.

Fire.

Who are you?

I do not know, sir.

I knew who I was
When I woke up this morning.

But I think I have changed
several times since.

What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.

I can not explain myself,
because I'm not myself.

I do not understand.
I can not express myself clearly.

I do not understand it myself.

It's very disconcerting to be
so many sizes in a day.

It is not.

You may not have...

You may not have thought so yet.
But when you die, and that makes you one day

Are you dressed, laid in a small box
and buried in the ground and the earth.

It will come to feel strange?
Not at all.

You may feel differently,
but for me it would be very strange.

You. Who are you?

Should not you say who you are first?
Why?

Wait.

Come back.
I have something important to say.

Master...... your mood.
Is that all?

No.

So...

You think you've changed?
I'm afraid so.

I do not remember what I used to remember.
Can not remember what?

I can not remember where I came from,
or how I actually came here.

It's not quite right.

How much would you be?
Slightly older would have been nice.

I would not be quite so young.

One side will make you taller.

On the other hand,
make you less.

Fungi...

Mommy loves you.

We take all the people.
What should we have for the kind of tea?

French tea.
French tea. Then we'll take the teacups.

Teatime.

What's her name?
Alice.

Like you?
She's in the country.

Your hair is so long.

For my shoulders.
Please sit still.

Then we wrap around this.
Hold it there.

Now we will take it through here.

About to hit, right?

Hello again!
You!

Lost yet?
I'm afraid so.

So you've found somewhere to go?
Yes. I want to go to the garden.

The behind the little door?
No garden. Never heard of it.

You're lying!
No!

I do not know what you are talking about.
Do you know someone who can point out the right direction?

A garden would be in the city,
so you can ask the doctor, or the painter.

Ask anyone you want. Both are mad.
I do not want to go among mad.

You've no choice?
We're all mad here.

Wait! Stop! Can you say
was the doctor and the painter is?

That way. I like how it looks that way.

You know nothing at all!
Neither are you, stupid little girl.

That way...

So I looked at the prostitutes
and she said to me: "I'm a man!"

No place.
No room!

What are you talking about? Certainly there is room.
And I miss a good tea.

This is not a tea party.
What do you drink then?

Cough medicine.
Do you cough?

Yes.

It's medicine.
Actual.

Take some wine.
I see no wine.

There's nothing.
Not kind to offer it.

Not nice of you to
sit without invitation.

Is that your paintings?
No, my.

I am a painter and he is my doctor.

Your hair needs to be cut.
You should not say personal things.

Very rude.
Tea, Doctor.

I have never learned
what is rude and not.

There's a fly in my cup.
Change locations!

Change places.

What was your name again?
Alice.

I like it.

I like it. Tell me, Alice.

Why is a raven like a writing desk?
I like riddles. Let's see...

You can not see it. It's a mystery.
I think I'll try to guess.

Do you mean that you can find the answer?
Exactly.

Then you should say what you mean.
I do.

I mean, at least what I say.
It is the same thing.

It's not at all the same thing.

You can say that you eat what you see
is the same as you see it you eat.

Or that I get what I want is the same as
I want what I get.

It's the same for you, doctor.

Can I get some?
No.

This is not for people like you.
I will not tolerate it!

But it's medicine.
Actual.

Is that why they call you crazy?
Because of medication?

They call me crazy?

Switch places.
Yes! Change places!

I have heard it said before.

So...

She's as crazy as we are.
Actual.

Terribly sorry, but it's true.
Tell me about your mother.

She's dead.
Mouse.

And what day of the month is it?
The fourth.

Wait, wait!
There are two days wrong again!

Dear. I told clockwork
would not withstand the butter.

It was the best butter.

Yes! But some crumbs must be complied with.

Then I well not stopped in the
with bread knife, right, Doc?

What an interesting watch.
The speaks about the date but not the time.

Why would it?
Speaks your watch on what year it is?

Of course not.
It's the same year a very long time.

It is the same with mine.
Do you have guessed my riddle yet?

No. I give up. What is the answer?
I have no idea.

I do not either.

You should not waste your time
with riddles you do not have answers to.

If you knew the time
half as well as I do-

You would not talk about wasting
"it away." The dear lady, is he.

I do not understand.
You have not even met the time?

Perhaps not. But I have to beat
pace when I learn music.

There we have it!
He can not get beat.

You'd held up well with him.

Will any of you to town then?
I thought about going there.

Not me. You see,
I am barred in town.

The last time I was there
I sang a little song. What I sang?

It went something like this.

Twinkle, twinkle little bat
How I wonder what you do?

You may be singing?
I've heard something like that.

It continues, you understand.
Up above the world you fly.

As a saucer in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, blink, blink.

Twinkle, twinkle, blink, blink.

I had barely
through the first verse before a police shouting:

"Hey, stop him!"
"He's madder than a hatter!"

So terribly cruel.
It was.

Were you arrested?
I?

Of course not!
I'm here now, right?

Doctor?

Well, civil obedience, my lady,
is for the square.

I have always seen me
himself more like a... Cube.

You've always been a little crazy?

Crazy?

Listen.

When they come back
I do not follow them.

I just wanted you to know.

You do not know how it is there.
It is not hygienic.

You're not from here?

I can always see it.

You...
You are very cute, you know?

I know.
Translation: gengmovie.com

Yes, you know it.
I mean, please.

Can you...

I mean, can you loosen my belt?

They are so tight.
I do not feel my hands.

I probably can not do it.
It's very easy. Do you see?

Pull the strap in the back, here.

I feel free and feel immediately better.

No! No no no!

Time for your medicine.

Please, no!

I do not want to go back there!
It is not hygienic!

So, so.
No reason to be violent.

It's for your own good.
I am well doctor?

Let me take care of you.

I do not want!
I do not want to!

So yes. Does not it feel better now?

I feel much better. Thanks.

But do not tell me it's just me
who can see the girl standing over there.

One of the patients have escaped from
his room! Get her back there!

Hey.

Is it your drawings?
Yes it is.

You see, I'm the painter,
and he is my doctor.

Who is this?

It's Alice.

Is she very pretty?

Can you tell me where she went?

I can not go any further.
The doctor said I can not go anymore.

Tell me, where are we now?
Where is this?

Tea?

Yes, please.

Nothing beats tea
to warm the spirits.

Do you know what I think?

I think you're crazy.

Excuse?

Mad.

No, no, I'm not crazy.

Crazy... crazy... crazy.

Alice went to town,
but I will not go there anymore.

Good boy.

Change places.

Well, Doctor?

I am free.

Do not be so uptight. Why so nervous?

What is it? Have you lost the power of speech?

You better come in from the rain. You want
not get pneumonia or TB.

It was better.

What's your name?
Alice.

It is a beautiful name.
Where are you from, Alice?

I'm lost.
And trying to find the way out.

Or up.
Up? Yes I understand.

I can not help you.

I'm lost myself,
for I will not go anywhere.

It also means that
I can not be found.

Can you at least point out the right direction?
No, I can not help you.

I am the pestilential, plague,
plague, the scourge, the infected.

I suffer from the disease that is injected.
No, I can not help you.

Located in the gutter, eat garbage, drink
rain, I can not help you.

Does it hurt?
That's the problem, darling.

It does not hurt at all.
You can not go to a hospital?

Hospital?
I got the disease in a hospital.

The doctors and scientists working
in their labs and their petri dishes.

They are not interested
of us now, anyway.

Not when the real disease is raging.

A cure then?
You will be able to cure all diseases one day.

One day people will live
forever. Regardless of their diseases.

And how do you know?
I just know.

People can still create good things. Big things.

If you want to see something good
may want to start here.

They seem to get ready to make
something sinister at that tree.

No point in messing with me.
I'm already dead.

But he is over there will be hung
for something he can not help.

No word from him could prevent
noose to tighten around his neck.

Alice.

You may find your help
by helping others.

Sin spear can not
harm the righteous.

The righteous can not be damaged.

Righteous.

Wait! Stop!

Stop!

So yes.

Do not cry.

Your tears do this much more difficult.

Do not be afraid, Alice.

We bring you home.

You want it?

You can not stay here.

Your presence... making a mess of things.

You understand well?

Who is this?
My name is Alice.

But I would just go.
Nonsense.

Where are you at this time?
Home? I do not think so.

I happen to know that you
are very far from home.

Come. You should stay here and use
your time to something useful.

We clean the machines on the back.

I'll teach you how to take apart
a gearbox.

We usually lock the doors when we are working.

It promotes... productivity.

Do you do me the honor?

Very well, Alice.
Give it back to me now.

No more pain! No more pain!

No more pain!

No more pain! No more pain!

Scatter.
Scatter and go home.

Factories like this should not exist.

You must take into fists if we should go.
As you wish.

Cut off her head!

Alice, wake up!
Wake up, Alice. Are you okay?

Thank God.
I had a strange dream.

A dream?

It was a rabbit and a man.
And then I fell.

I fell far down,
and on the ground crying I-

Because I did not remember who I was
and could not get out.

I almost drowned in my tears.
Alice, this is madness!

Come now, it's time to go.
Gather your things go.

You want to tell me
the father of your adventures?

No. I keeps it enough
myself. For a while, anyway.

Good. We do not want the father suspicious.

Or maybe he wants to know.
Wait, what?

None. I said he probably is not
interested in your stories anyway.

Now we must go. It's very late.

You have had enough of adventure for a day
and I was sufficiently frightened.

Not again, Alice!
