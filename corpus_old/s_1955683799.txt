Mother.

You walked with me then.

In the silence.

Before there was a world.

Before night or day.

Alone in the stillness.

Where nothing was.

Mother.

Where are you?

Where have you gone?

I fear.

Full of trouble.

A riddle to myself.

Am I not your child?

Who are you?

Life giver.

Light bringer.

Mother.

Born.

Now.

I am.

Life.

Restless.

Unsatisfied.

I thirst.

Light.

Dark.

Speak with me.

What am I?

Where?

Who brought me here?

Oh mother.

Abyss of light.

All beholding.

Blazing.

Shining through all time.

I touch you.

You burn with fire.

I tremble,

Quake in wonder.

Where are you leading me?

Oh life.

Giver of good.

Creating yourself

In ever changing shapes.

You give

without asking.

Nature.

Who am I to you ?

You devour youself

Only to give birth to yourself again.

Will we always be together?

Oh light of love.

Don't be far from me.

You waken me.

Endless source.

Endless river.

Shapeless as a cloud.

Mother of all.

From you

all things ascend.

Stone flows

like mist.

The many change

and pass.

You endure.

A living flame

hidden in all things.

Where are you?

You.

Too great to see.

No end to your birth.

Eternal birth.

What is this world?

The stricken ox.

The abandoned child.

The wound.

The old woman.

Might we be deceived?

The soul.

A wish.

A dream.

And we know nothing.

Blind.

Oh life.

Hear my voice.

Mother.

Does your goodness never fail?

Will you abandon me?

Did love make me?

Mother.

Where have you gone?

Why are you silent?

Can a mother forget her child?

You do nothing.

See nothing wrong.

I fear you.

You, whom I should love.

So much joy.

Why not always?

Giver of good.

Life.

To you

all things flow back.

The bridge.

The gate.

Oh mother.

What did they accomplish?

Sorrow.

Pain.

Time.

Ravaging.

Devouring all.

What lasts?

How do I reach you?

You,

the good towards which all things aspire.

Beyond time.

Beyond sorrow.

Mother.

What do I love,

when I love you?

You.

The light.

The dark.

The moth.

The flame.

The friend

and the stranger.

The wine

and the cup.

The dawn.

Our light.

Oh mother.

The tears you wept.

The scenes you've looked on.

Love poured out.

The strivings.

Hopes.

The shadows flee.

The show.

Time goes back to her source.

Mother.

I take your hand.

I dream no more.

Joined to you.

Leaf to branch.

Branch to tree.

Love binds us together.

What lives in you

can't die.

Oh life!

Oh mother!
