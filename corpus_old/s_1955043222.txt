    Man: You know, you
    want me to tell you

        something really
        interesting, man?

    I was gonna wear a suit
    in this interview,

    but I thought it would
    have been too much,

    so I might as well put
    these nice sweatpants on

    and this nice shirt on.

    It's a little too--
    you know, too much, I think.

    But next time, when we
    have a good interview,

    I'll wear a suit, OK?

    Woman: One thing I
    will mention is that

    at times, you know,
    if you ask a question,

there may be oc-occasions where
I--it may take me a little while

to respond, um, but that's
only because, um, it's--

I'm just trying to process
the--the incoming speech,

and then I'm trying to verbally
    process the answer.

    So you may hear a pause,
    you know, at times, so...

    Man, voice-over: I'm
    from St. Paul, Minnesota.

I--I like living in St. Paul.

    Different man, voice-over:
    I never knew for sure

if I was gonna get married
or not, so that is something

that, um, I never was really
    fixated on doing.

It's always been important to me
to have somebody in my life,

    but whether or not I was
    married to that person,

    I wasn't sure about.

    So, what kind of questions
    you got to ask me?

    Good. I feel good
    about documentaries.

        I'm comfortable
        with looking at--

    anywhere on the camera,
    actually, so...

            Hello? I'd like to
            buy a cigar.

Yeah. Just one?

        Let me see that
        big one up there.

        Hey, I got something
        to ask you.

        Did you hear about that
        one basketball coach

        that lived a long
        time ago?

What happened to him?

        The bask--the Celtics
        coach...

Uh-huh.

            Red Auerbach.
            Did you ever

            hear about that guy?

No.

            I'll tell you
            what he did.

        Tell me what you
        think about this, OK?

        Every time--OK. He was
        stubborn, arrogant,

        and he was a jerk, OK?

All right.

        And every time
        he won a big game--

        he won 9 championships--
OK.

        Every time he won
        a big game, he would--

He'd smoke a cigar.

            He would smoke
            a cigar, and--

It's a celebration.

            Hold on.
            He would rub it

            in the other team's
            face.

Well, it's
a cele--

        No, he would, like...
        He was--

It's a celebration.

        How much is this thing?

That's $9.80.

Out of $10.

    [Cash register beeps]

20 cents back.
Would you like a bag?

            I'm good.

Have a great
weekend.

            You, too.

    Woman: I knew that there
    was something special

    with Lenny right away.

    And he would always, like,
    move his hands, like,

he would, like, get excited
    and move his hands,

and he was very--always really,
really meticulous about stuff,

even when he was little,
like where it needed to be.

He just--when he wouldn't talk,

    I knew that there was
    something going on.

        It's been hard.

You've got this kid that doesn't
really want to be autistic,

    and Lenny's smart enough to
    know that he's different,

    and he doesn't like it.

    That's a big, big struggle.

    Lenny, voice-over:
    Sometimes in my life,

    I try to pretend
    I was never autistic.

    I felt like I had to
    hide it from people

    because if they heard
    you were it,

then they would kind of...

    kind of laugh at you
    a little bit.

People would think to me, like,
you know, "He's cool,"

and when they found out I was
    in that situation,

    they would be like,
"Oh, he's kind of a weird kid.

    We shouldn't be
    hanging out with him."

    Sometimes I feel
    a little bit scared

    because let's say you go--
    you see a girl

    and she likes you
    and all this stuff,

    and maybe if you admit
    that you're autistic,

maybe she'll be like, "I don't
want to be with you no more

    because you're autistic."

I don't know. That could be
a little hurtful, a little bit.

    I'm single, by the way.

        I've been single
        for a long time.

Had one girlfriend, but it
didn't quite work out that well.

I don't want to talk about that.
        Is that OK?

    It's just, you know,
    bad memories.

She was really not very nice,

    and I know that sex
    was a really big issue

    because she had wanted
    to have sex

    and Lenny didn't want to,
            and, um,

    they split up for a while,

    and then when he got back
    together with her,

    they ended up having sex,

    and it wasn't, like,
    a good thing.

Like, I really didn't realize
how little Leonard knew

        until recently.

Like, he didn't know anything.

I just want to tell those young
kids, "Don't have sex yet."

    You know, you're gonna
    get screwed one day.

    Well, you can have sex
    with the girl or the guy

for both of you when--I feel
like it doesn't have to happen

        the first day.

No way. You're jumping the gun.

    You're shooting
    the gun right away.

    You've got to do it
    when it's, like,

    a couple of months
    into it, man.

        Or maybe a year.

    When you get married.
    That's what I think.

    Don't have sex
    on the first date.

That's not love right there.

That's just--that's not love

    when you do it
    on the first date,

    when you meet someone
    for the first time or--

that's called reckless love.

    That's called reckless.

    Kathy: He's lonely.
    He wants a girlfriend.

    And his dad's not around,
    and he just doesn't have

that positive male role model
to kind of tell him, like,

    "This is how you do it.
    This is what you do.

    "This is"--you know,
    he's got me.

        He's got Mom.

    [Indistinct voice on TV]

Dave: I met Lindsey at
a national autism conference

    from the Autism Society
    of America

    in Nashville, Tennessee,
    in July of 2005.

    We started calling it
    a relationship

in the fall of that year,
maybe 3 or 4 months later

    when we met up
    at another conference,

    and I asked her,
    "How would you feel

    about being in
    a relationship with me?"

She said, "Well, I'm confused,
but I could see if this maybe--

        this may work."

She was confused at first,
but she could see this working.

    "We'll give it a try."

        [Door opens]

                    Hi!

Hi!

            How are you?

I'm good.

                Welcome home.

Thank you.

Lindsey, voice-over: I think
that autism definitely

presents unique challenges
to our relationship.

    Our particular routines

and rigidities and our--our

particular comfort zones and...

we're so fixated on--on that

that it's sometimes difficult

to communicate to each other.

Love your necklace.

            Oh! Thanks.

            Do you know--
            did I ever tell you,

            um, one bene--
            one reason I love

            jewelry so much is
            because it gives me

            a, um--a sort
            of a sh--a shield

            to sort of protect
            myself from sort of

            vulnerable elements?

That's--that's news
to me, actually.

I didn't know that.

                Oh, really?

Vulnerable elements.

            Yeah. I kind of
            discovered that

            after wearing
            necklaces

            for the past
            several--you know,

            the past--especially
            the last 10 years.

        I've really been into
        wearing heavy jewelry,

        and I discovered
        a reason why it was--

        that it kind of makes
        me--because I feel

        so vulnerable and feel
        so, um, shy and...

Mm-hmm.

        you know, introverted

        that wearing the jewelry
        kind of makes me feel

        that sort of false
        sense of confidence,

        and it kind of makes
        me feel less vulnerable.

        It makes me feel like
        it's sort of a shield,

        sort of protect myself
        from feeling, um,

        more--more vulnerable.

Well, it looks like
the weather just came on.

I was gonna, like,
catch a glimpse here

and see what he says
about the--

        Oh, of course. I can't
        ever interrupt you

        from the weather.

Well, you can always s--
be near me,

but I may not
talk to you as much.

                Yeah, but--

    [Increases TV volume]

Man on TV: 47. Not gonna
fall that fast tonight.

Winds are still
gonna be a factor.

Northwest at 16.

            I'm gonna go.
            I'll be right back.

        OK.

Man on TV: And it should
all be finished

tomorrow night,

which is a good thing.

Satellite picture...

    Man on TV:
    and lots of sunshine

        and 64 on Monday.

    Chance of showers
    and rain Monday night

        into Tuesday...

    [Music box playing]

Should we go rock
in your rocking chair?

Shall we?

    Man, voice-over:
    We tried to treat her

    as normally as
    we possibly could,

all the time making allowances
    in our own mind

for the fact that she might not
be able to do everything

quite as fast or quite as well
or something like that

but just trying to raise her as
normally as we possibly could.

Here we go. Ah!

Here we go.
Here we go.

Here we go.

Here we go.
Come on. Lindsey?

Gordon, voice-over: We all,
evidently, come equipped

with a social antenna that we
don't even realize we have.

    We know instinctively
    when we are getting

too close to someone physically,
when we seem to be pushing them

    a little further than
    they want to be pushed,

when maybe we should back off

    and not be quite so bossy
    or controlling.

Lindsey didn't have the antenna.

Gordon: Lindsey,
can you wave?

Say--Lindsey.

            Here's the water.

Lindsey.

        Woman: She just asked
        me to put the hat

            back on her.

    Different woman: Cute.

Gordon: Lindsey.

        [Toddler crying]

        Gordon: Can you wave?
        Can you wave?

        Child: Yeah.

        Gordon: Yeah.

    Gordon, voice-over:
    It's sort of mystifying,

        but the absence
        of that antenna,

        very hard.

    That was very
    challenging for her.

    She wanted to fit in.

    Man: Oh. Has anybody
    seen Lindsey?

    Group: Where is Lindsey?

        [Laughter]

    Woman: There she is!

    There she is. Yeah.

    Woman: Lesser-known names
    for 600, please.

    Alex Trebek: Senator Robert
    Wagner sponsored the act--

    Man: What is the National
    Labor Relations Board?

    What is the National Labor
    Relations Board?

        Alex: Rob.

    Rob: What is the National
    Labor Relations Board?

        Alex: Correct.

    Rob: Compound words
        for 400.

    Alex: Motorcyclist
    Evel Knievel

        is called this
        on his tombstone...

What's a daredevil?

        Alex: and by
        the Smithsonian.

Man: What's a daredevil?

        Alex: Joshua.

        Joshua: What is
        a daredevil?

        Alex: That's it.

            I did very well,
            huh?

You did very well.

                    Thank you.

I'm proud of you.

                    Thank you.

    Woman on TV: Monday
    at 6:30...

Matt: What are you having
for dinner tonight?

        Uh, sole--fish
        with mashed potatoes.

        Have you got
        mashed potatoes?

                Woman: Not yet.

Matt:
Are you cooking?

            My mother
            is cooking.

Matt: Oh, OK.
Do you ever cook?

            I cook hot dogs
            every Sunday.

            I cook hot dogs
            every Sunday.

    Matt: When he was young,
    did you think

    that he would be capable
    of a romantic relationship?

            [Sigh]

    No. I didn't dare hope.
    I didn't dare hope.

Man, voice-over: Although, uh,

his expression was not there,

    but he had knowledge.

        [Stephen reading
        prayer in Hebrew]

    Mother: But of course,

    he still does not elaborate
    and doesn't express himself

    too--too well about
    his real feelings.

    His language is still
    not up to the way

        it should be.

He talks, and he
communicates, and...

                But in
                a certain way.

In a certain way.

Matt: So tell me more
about your job, Stephen.

        Well, I was doing
        assembly work,

        and I was working
        in stamps,

        and I worked on trays.

What's trays?

        Trays just means
        to fold for the U--

        for the United
        States Postal Service.

Oh, OK. And so
when you do stamps,

what--tell me what
you have to do for stamps.

            To put them
            in envelopes.

How many do you do
a day, would you say?

            Uh, 500.

Wow. That's a big
workload.

                    Yes.
Wow.

And how many hours
a day do you work?

            8 hours, from 7:00
            until 3:00.

OK. How do you get
to work?

                By bus.

Do you take one bus
or more than one?

            Just the bus.
            Just one bus.

Just one bus.
                Yes.

Oh. Do you like
the bus?

                Yes.

Edith, voice-over: Our aim was
he should become independent.

    He should be able to
    hold down a job.

        That, thank God,
        we accomplished

    without him being
    institutionalized.

Lenny: He's a bad man, this guy.

Kathy: What's up,
dude?

        Lenny: What's up,
        Mom?

        Let me finish up
        the game first.

Come on.

So we talked about

a dating website
a little bit.

        Yeah. I think I might
        want to do that.

What would you put if you
were, like, putting, like--

            I don't know.
            It's hard to say.

            I like to keep it
            private

            to me and you only.

        I'm gonna be serious.

        I'm not gonna be
        no joking around.

OK, if you were gonna
put on a dating website,

like, your interests--

                Sports.

OK. What else?

You wouldn't put--
how come you wouldn't

put any of, like,
the Comic-Con stuff?

Do you think
that's silly?

            Nope. I won't
            do it.

How come?

            Because I don't
            want to.

OK.

            That's you. That's--

But why don't you--
you don't want to find

somebody that likes
that kind of stuff, too?

                Nope.

So, what other interests
would you put?

                I don't know.

            I'll be taken
            more serious.

So you want, like,
a serious girl?

            Yeah, a little bit.

OK. A businesswoman?

            No, not completely,

            but I pay
            for the dates.

            Me. That's the way
            it goes.

    OK.

            That's the way
            the show goes.

        I'm not gonna let her
        pay for everything

        and me, you know,
        I got to be the one

            that...

        is the more independent
        one than her.

But I don't think
that that's fair.

            No, it is fair.

Kind of chauvinistic.

            No, it's not.

I think a little bit.

I mean, what if there's
a woman out there

that is perfect for you

but she makes more money
than you do?

            Nope.
            I won't take her.

            I'm serious.
            I won't take her.

    Kathy: He does not want
    to be different.

    He just wants to be
    like everybody else,

    so then he goes above
    and, like, kind of goes

    beyond trying to fit in,
    and everybody--

I can see they're like,
"Why is he acting like this?"

        Like, we all know
        Lenny's special,

    so he just needs to be
    who he is, and he's not.

    He tries to be
    something different.

            Lenny: I need to
            be the one

            making more money.

            I hear so many
            things about--

            I hear so many
            YouTube videos

            about women.

By men. OK--

            No. It's a woman
            saying,

            "Don't be
            with broke-ass men."

    Wow.

These are the kind
of women--

            No, they're trying
            to inform the women

            not to be
            with broke men,

            and I don't want
            to be--

            I don't want to be
            a broke male

            with a woman.

        I don't want her
        paying for everything.

        I need to be the one--

You don't have to be
paying for everything--

or she doesn't have to
be paying for everything.

You could be paying
for stuff,

but when you get into
a relationship with somebody,

you're supposed to be
their partner. Partner.

            Well, I need to be
            the one doing more.

            That's the way
            it goes.

I don't think
that's the way it goes.

I think that you're
being misinformed

by people that are just
not really great people.

I think you're
being misinformed.

                I'm not.

I think you are.

What if you find
somebody--

and I'm just saying
if you love somebody,

it shouldn't matter.

It should be, like,
you just love her,

and maybe one day you'll
be making more money,

and you guys just
support each other

in that good kind of
like foundation and--

            It's just hard.

            It's just hard
            to believe that.

Why?

    It's just about being
    the more independent one.

But you will be
independent.

You're going to
be independent.

That is gonna
happen, Lenny.

Sometimes it takes
a minute for people.

It's hard. That transition
from fricking--into manhood?

That thing, that's hard.

                I know.

I couldn't even--
it was hard--

            I'm good,
            though, Mom.

            I'm trying
            to be good.

Well, trying to be
good how?

I want you
to feel good.

            I'm just going
            through

            a little bit
            of a struggle.

            I'm down on myself
            too many times,

            and it's too tough
            because I feel like

            I should be accept--
            doing more in life.

Do you think--
do you consider yourself

like less sometimes?

That's kind of what
I get.

            Sometimes.

Why?

        I feel different.

        I feel better than being
        autistic sometimes.

Let's get past this.

Let's get over this
and get on with it

because you're
fricking awesome.

            I know. I know.

I don't think you do.

                I know.

I think you don't
and you need to know.

                    OK.
I love you.

    Kathy: He's really
    down on himself.

I think once he starts working,

    he's gonna feel
    better about himself.

He's gonna feel more productive,

    like he's out there
    doing something.

Because right now he doesn't
feel like he's doing anything.

    Man on TV: Some points
    in Massachusetts

    and Rhode Island could see
    up to a foot of snow,

and in New Jersey,
well, the storm is certainly...

Lindsey, voice-over: I always
knew I was different,

    even before I was informed
    of my diagnosis of autism,

    though I always felt like
    I was an odd character

    outside of my--my peers.

    But I didn't really
    understand why.

I would often get turned away,

    or people would ignore me,
    and I--I thought,

"Well, what am I doing wrong?"

And even after learning about
    my own diagnosis,

I still, for several years,
struggled to figure out

    why I couldn't, um,
    maintain and keep friends,

why I couldn't fit in,
why I couldn't be accepted.

Unfortunately, I think the first
impressions I received, um,

when I was learning about autism
    were quite negative,

        and as a result,

    I felt incredibly ashamed
    of being autistic.

Every morning when I get ready,
I look in the mirror

before I step outside the house,
and I think to myself,

        "Well, I look OK.
        I look OK today."

    And the moment I step
    outside the front door,

    I immediately become
    self-conscious.

I've recognized pretty quickly

that the way I perceive myself

    in the outside world

is drastically different than
the way I perceive myself

        in my own world.

    In some aspects
    and at some times,

I do feel like I have found
that personal happiness

    within myself,
    or that personal peace.

    But it's still very
    difficult for me

    to find acceptance
    of myself.

    I have just learned how
    to be a good actress.

Woman: I remember when
you first started at work,

and, um, I wasn't sure--
I wasn't necessarily sure

what to expect
because, you know,

everybody on the spectrum
is different, and...

            Oh, yeah.
            Yeah, absolutely.

you never know if
somebody is going to be

very outgoing or--you know,
kind of the classic

description of someone
on the spectrum

is not--you know,
unfortunately,

not interested,
empathetic,

you know, not into--

        I always had this fear
        people would be

        staring at me, that...

        people can see
        right through me.

        I think it kind of
        relates to

        my frustration I've
        had over the years

            of...

        being pressured to fit
        into the social norm...

        that I'm not good enough
        if I don't fit in.

Have you ever dated
somebody

who was on
the spectrum before?

        Actually, all--all
        the guys I've dated

        prior to Dave were--

        yeah, were not
        on the spectrum.

        So Dave is the first.

And how is it
different?

    Dave: For me, it boils
    down to 3 things.

    I have a formula here.

    It's L plus P plus two T.

    So each part is 25%.

So you have 25% of the P and L,
and you have 50% of the T,

    which results to what that
    person's grade would be

    in terms of relationship
    and dating potential.

    Now, you're wondering,

L is how they look physically--

    physical appearance
    and attributes.

        The second--the P
        is personality.

What is their lifestyle like?

    And most importantly is T
    is how they treat you.

    Treatment towards you.

If--let's say, for example,

    that the person
    is relatively ugly.

Then they get, like, a 50%
category in the L category.

But they have, you know,
like a perfect personality

    and nearly perfect way
    they treat you,

they're gonna score pretty well
in the overall scheme of things.

So the T has greater weight.

    It's twice as much weight
    in the formula

than the personality and looks
is how they treat you.

        [Playing piano]

    Lindsey: You know,
    it's funny with Dave.

He--he's much more scientific,
and I'm much more artistic.

I think Dave is trying his best
        to understand me.

    I think he always has
tried his best to understand me.

    I think it's still
    difficult for him to--

    to really have that grip,
    though, of understanding,

    of why I have
    my particular issues.

        [Playing piano]

    You know, it's
    a very good question

whether someone can love you
without truly understanding you.

    I still think it's
    absolutely possible. Yeah.

You know, obviously
we have, from time to time,

talked about marriage
and, um, if we were

to get married someday
and kind of

some of the fears
we have with that.

Um, uncertainties.

        Yeah, and idea of
        whether Lindsey

        would take my name
        or keep her own name.

        And talk about, like,
        prenuptial agreements

        and how they would
        be written out

        and, uh,
        financial matters,

        how they'd be, um,
        managed.

        Um, things like that.

Yeah.

        And where the wedding
        would take place.

Yeah, well, I think
that's not really fears.

I think that's just
more of, you know,

listing the pros
and cons

and kind of--
it's the whole idea

of whether marriage
is going to dictate

that our identities
are lost.

That's kind of
my main fear.

            I'd still support

            keeping
            our own identities.

            I mean, marriage is
            just a--kind of like

            a social title
            we would have,

            but we'd still have
            our own identities.

Yeah.

            Of course. I would
            insist upon it.

    I mean, Dave has--has been
    through a lot with me,

    and he's still around,

    and that to me is definitely
    evidence of--of love.

Dave: I love it when she shows
me physical, um, appreciation,

when she holds me, hugs me,
kisses me, smiles at me.

I always love it when she comes
to tuck me into bed at night.

But I feel like she puts me very
high up on her daily list.

I feel like I'm very much
    important to her

    and that I'm a big part
    of her life.

    But the T score also
    ties in very much

    to how important
    that person makes you feel.

    If you don't--if you get
    the impression

    that person doesn't think
    you're important,

    that hurts your T score.

When I was first dating her
and first meeting her,

I never had stronger feelings
for anybody else ever before.

The fact that they lasted for 8
years I think is a good signal

    that things were on a very
    solid course here.

            [Chatter]

        [Music playing]

        Man: When Stephen
        first saw Gita,

    he was introduced to her.

    Stephen said,
    "I'm going to marry her."

        [Laughter]

And after a few days, Gita said,
    "Let's set a date."

        [Laughter]

    Well, the date is here,

    and this is the couple,

    and we hope that
    this marriage is from God.

It's going to be a lasting
marriage and a happy marriage.

    Stephen, voice-over:
    I met Gita 20 years ago.

    It was on February 7, 1993.

            Matt: What day of
            the week was that?

    It was on a Sunday.

            What did you say
            to her

            when you first
            met her?

    "Hello."

        And what did you think
        when you first met her?

It's nice. It was beautiful.

            Are you in love
            with Gita?

Yes, I'm in love with Gita.

            What does that mean?

I don't know.
It means to fall in love,

to give a kiss
and a hug.

            How do you know
            when you're in love?

I don't know.

        Max: Somebody suggested
        they knew of Gita.

        They said, "Maybe
        these two together--

        "these two will
        get together.

        Maybe they'll make--
        they'll make a couple."

Edith: They were kind of
complementing each other.

Gita is very verbal.
That's what Stephen is lacking.

Stephen has other qualities
that she was lacking,

so they really
complemented each other.

        Max: They lived happily
        for almost 17 years,

        and then unfortunately,

        Gita got ovarian cancer,

        and she's fighting with
        it for the last 3 years.

Remember 3 years ago,
Gita had chemo?

3 years ago.

        Matt: What is chemo?

I don't know.
It's a disease.

                Is that bad?

It's bad.

            So, what happened
            after chemo?

I don't know.

She went to the doctor.

She went to the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester.

            What happened there?

Uh, she had to go--

yeah, she had tests
for her cancer.

She had tests.

            And what did
            the tests say?

Uh, her condition
is, uh, I don't know.

Edith, voice-over:
Stephen is very hopeful

about her sickness.

He says, "Gita's
not gonna die.

She'll be all right."

        [Indistinct
        voice on TV]

        Hi, Marlena.

    I feel a little better.
    I'm getting better.

            Hello.

    Hi, honey.

                Hello.

    Gita, voice-over:
    The thing with Stephen

        is that he is...

        I find that
        he understands me

        in his own way.

    I have a learn--a mild
    learning disability,

    and, um--ahem--
    so but still and all,

    I feel in a way that
    I can understand him

    because he can--because
    we both have something

    we cannot do
    and things we can do,

    but being that
    we have disabilities,

            we can...

    we can relate all the more.

Tell me what else
is new.

                Nothing.

Nothing? Well,
I--I relaxed all day...

            That's good.

trying to feel better.

            Uh-huh. That's nice.

Yeah.

    I don't know if this is
    the right thing to say,

    but I feel bad that he's
    not able to express himself,

    and I'm--and I try to
    encourage him,

        to make him feel
        as if he can,

    and you know something?

    He has improved a lot.

How was your day?

            It was excellent.

What did you do?

            Well, I worked--

            I worked on towels
            today at MBI.

Towels? What do
they look like?

            Well, they look
            like, uh--

            they look like
            wash towels.

                They look like
                dish towels.

Oh, nice.
What colors were they?

            They were purple.

Oh, nice. What's
your favorite color?

                Blue.

Blue. And my favorite
color is red.

            Well, that's nice.

            You have a nice hat,
            huh?

Yeah. Just look at me.

                    Yes.
Relax.

    It's always difficult.

    It's always difficult,
    but I got used to it.

    I got used to it.

It's extremely difficult,
but I think if I were married

    to someone who it--
    wasn't disabled

    or who isn't disabled,
    I'd have more of a problem

because that person might
be--be--ahem--demanding

    and want more out of me.

So tell me more.

            Well, I'm going to
            eat dinner

            at my parents'.

Oh, that's good.

            Well, I hope
            you'll feel better,

            and I'll see you
            later.

See you later,
honey.

Thanks for dropping by
and wishing me well.

                You're welcome.

            Matt: How do you
            know that Stephen

            is in love with you?

        Gita: Um...

        it's in the way
        he looks at me.

        I can tell.

        He gives me
        such loving eyes.

    Dave: Love is a very
    abstract concept

that many people with autism
have a hard time grasping,

and it's one of those things
that's not concrete.

As a scientist, I wish I could
put it into perspective

as a type of subatomic particle,
        but it's not.

    Love is basically
    more like a force.

        Like, in physics,
        you have forces--

    forces of attraction--
    and I have a feeling

    that love is--the best way
    to describe that

    is a force of attraction
    between two people

    that is neither visible,
    measurable, or heard.

There's no way to quantify it.

    Lenny: I'm feeling a little
    down about myself right now.

Matt: Why is that?

    I've just been down lately.

    I've been a little...

    sometimes you go through
    hard times in your life.

    I feel like I can't
    get a girl.

    I don't--there are
    no girls at my school.

    Everywhere I go,
    it's something about guys.

    I go home,
    I see my stepfather,

    and the only women I see
    are my good friends

or my--my--my sister, like,

        girls are sort of
        like my sisters

    or my home girls,
    and that's so annoying.

    You don't see women
    anywhere.

    It's like--I feel like
    if someone came up to me

and said, "Would you--would you
want to go to a women's prison

    for a week?" I would
    probably say yes.

    "Would you--would you go
    to a women's jail for a week

    and be the only man there?"

    I'd probably say yes.

Lenny, voice-over: I feel like,
you know, if I had a girl,

    maybe--maybe I'll be
    happy right now.

    Maybe I'll be--
    feel good about myself.

    You know what, Matt?

        I'm gonna admit
        something to you.

    Do you want me
    to tell you something?

    I like girls that are black.

    I like them a lot.
What do you think about that?

Do you know what interracial--
interracial relationships are?

    Inter--interracial
    relationships?

It means when different race
people go out with each other.

    I was reading something
    on the computer

            that...

    black women are really
    independent,

    and it said that
    they're lucky girl--

    that they're really
    intelligent women,

and I feel like that, you know,
I want a girl like that,

    but I feel like I can't.

Matt: Why do you think
you can't?

    Because, you know,
    they're too independent.

        I need to be more
        independent.

    I need to get a good job
    and make good money.

    Dave, voice-over: You get
    married for love, too,

but for me, there's more of
a practical component as well.

    Probably 60% practical
    and 40% emotional.

    I'll always love her.
    That won't change.

    But for the specific
    reasons for the marriage,

that's what it'd boil down to.

    Lindsey, voice-over:
I had told him a few years ago

    that whenever he was ready
    to take that next step,

    that I would be
    willing to--to accept.

    I've--I've yet to hear
    any kind of indicator

    that that next step
    may be taken.

        Um, I know that we kind
        of brushed over this,

        like, when we chatted
        about it.

        I do believe you
        and trust you

        when--when you've
        told me that

        you were in it
        for the long haul.

Oh, yeah.

        And I do believe you,
        and I do--you know,

        I do trust you,
        and I--I, um, you know,

        I definitely am in it
        for the long haul

        for us, too, and I--
        I wouldn't--you know,

        I wouldn't be here
        if I wasn't.

Well, I know that.

                Yeah.

        I guess I'm just--
        I was just still

        kind of just figuring
        out, like--

That was a conversation
that made me

a little bit
uncomfortable, too.

            Oh, you mean
            at the time?

Yeah, yeah.

        Yeah. Well, it's
        uncomfortable

        for me, too, but...

        it's important.

        It's important.
        Sometimes I think

        there's conversations
        that are uncomfortable

        for us, but they're
        really important

        to have or at least
        to address them

        in order to us
        to understand

        where each other
        are coming from.

        So I--I'm not gonna lie.
        So...

But having this on camera,
I don't like at all.

I don't like the idea
of having this conversation

on camera at all.

                OK.

It's one of those things
that's best left

off camera, I think.

            OK. We can stop
            talking about it.

Yes.

            All right.
            Thank you for--

            thank you for
            letting me know.

I think--yeah, I just
feel better that way.

                    OK.

I just feel
uncomfortable

being on camera
talking about it.

            All right.
            No, thank you

            for letting me know.

But you know how
I feel,

so don't worry
about it.

    Lindsey, voice-over:
    There's been times

that I have questioned whether
he really wants to be with me.

Gordon: Within yourself,
you think you can communicate.

        You think you've
        said something.

    You think it should be
    obvious to somebody

that's this, this, and this,

    but again you go back
    to the antenna.

Maybe you are, but maybe
they haven't picked that up.

Stephen, voice-over: Yes,
this is my apartment with Gita.

    Uh, this is our bedroom.

    It's beautiful, isn't it?

Gita moved here with me, uh--
    that was 15 years ago.

        [Door closes]

    And this is our bathroom.

Stephen, voice-over: She moved--
she had to go--she had surgery

        on--in May 2010.

    That was 3 years ago.

Stephen, voice-over: I'll take
a shower tonight at 7:00.

Edith: OK, maybe at 7:30
if you go later to Gita's.

        I'll go--I'll go see
        Gita right now.

I think they're
eating, still.

        They're eating--no,

        they're
        still eating dinner.

        They're eating dinner.

Yeah, because Erica
was making it late...

                Yes.

because Gita wasn't
feeling well.

        I hope Gita
        will feel better.

I hope so.

She threw up.

            She felt nauseous.

Yeah. Did she
tell you that?

            Yeah, she told
            me that.

When you were there?

                Yes.

     I'm trying--I'm trying
     to be positive, man.

           I'm just--

   it's been kind of hard
   the past couple of weeks.

      Last week I did
      something to a girl,

      and it wasn't right.

  It felt--it felt
  kind of stupid, what I did.

  I was bored. I wanted to see
  what women felt like.

 It felt good for a little bit.

  Maybe for, like, 20 minutes
  it felt good, but it just

        felt like you--
        two things.

    It felt like you wanted
    to do it more times,

     but it just felt like
     whatever at the end

       because it just--
       that wasn't--

    I don't--
    I don't know that girl.

       I don't--
       I don't love her.

         I just--
         it felt like,

     I kind of felt bad for
     her a little bit.

   People told me that--
   I talked to 2 or 3 people.

      [Whispers] I kind of
      want to say it

    when there aren't
    that many people around.

I kind of want to say it softly
because it isn't good.

  People tell me that, "Oh"--

    p-people, they tell me,
    "Oh, you got ripped off

  for just touching her ass."

   People told me that "you
   could have gotten a ha--"

    People told me that I
    could have gotten a ---.

     People--you know
     what this stuff means?

   People told me that
   I could have gotten a ---.

     People told me that I
     could have gotten--

        could have ---.

      People told me that
      I could have...

          had --- her.

  That's what people told me--

        those 4 things,
        People told me

  people told me that I could
  have done those 4 things

   with--with the 20 bucks,
   that "you got ripped off"

    and "delete her number."

     She told me
     her name was Diamond.

   That--that doesn't sound
   like a real name, does it?

Dave, voice-over: I've been
together with her for 8 years,

    and a lot of people
    are wondering,

"Why are you still
just boyfriend/girlfriend?"

A lot of people are asking,

    "When are y'all
    gonna get married?"

That's, um--that's always a big
step for a guy to take,

    and got to make sure
    it's the right one.

    When we talked about it,
    she made me feel like,

"Oh, I do want to marry you,

    but maybe now's
    not the right time."

    That's--it's not likely,

    but it's possible
    she might say that.

Uh, I--sometimes what she thinks
is different from what I think,

            so...

    Lindsey, voice-over:
    I think before I said yes,

    I'd want to ask him...

    what in particular
    had been holding him back

    the past few years,

    since when I first
    brought it up.

Gordon: Nobody was exactly at
the same place at the same time.

I hope, for her sake, that--
that they will eventually

    make a--a firm and formal
    commitment to each other.

    OK, maybe it's just
    a few simple words

    or something like that.

    Maybe it's just a little
    formal ceremony,

    something like that,
    but it means something.

    It makes a difference.

It--it gives a base for someone
to feel self-confident

about giving everything of
themselves to the other person

    without restraint
    or without holding back.

But I think that's just one
    of the challenges

        that they've had
        to work through.

        [Indistinct]

        So do you still, um,
        continue to think

        about the future?

        Like next steps
        and stuff like that.

Well, I--I thought
we had that conversation

recently about how
I wasn't reading your mind

and I wasn't sure.
                    Yeah.

And then you--you
reassured me

that, um, you...

that I--I shouldn't
be worried about anything.

            Just I was gonna see
            if still--

            everything is still
            the case.

            Is that still
            the same thing?

            You wouldn't be
            hesitant

            to the idea of
            marriage, would you?

I don't think you've
ever been so candid

about this
conversation before.

I guess you've been
thinking about it.

            I have.

        [Chatter from
        other tables]

Well, I--I'll be
honest with you.

I think regardless,
I'm always going to be

afraid of anything
that involves, um,

major life transition.

                Right.

Right? And marriage
is one of them.

            Is what? I'm sorry.

Marriage is
one of them.

            Yeah, it is.

            We seem pretty
            happy, though,

            as a couple,
            don't we?

            We seem pretty happy
            as a couple, right?

Well, the question
is, do we feel happy?

                I do.

I--I feel similarly.

    Lenny: I am high class.

        You know that?

What? You calling me stupid?

    I'll call you stupid.

        You know what?
Let me tell you something, Matt.

    I didn't know what
    the hell happened, man.

    Let me just tell you
    what happened.

    I wish I was not autistic.

        There. I'm gonna
        say it right now.

    I don't like it.
    It makes me different.

        I don't like it.

    I wish I could have
    been a normal person.

    I wish I could have been

    a normal, regular person.

        My mom says,
    "Be autistic. Accept it."

    I tried accepting it.

        It's hard.

    Can I be honest with you?

If I could change something--
        if I could--

I'm gonna try to change it,

    but I told my mom this
    right now

    because of how
    disappointed I was.

        I would rather be
        a normal man

than be an autistic person
with a million dollars.

There. If God came up to me
and says, "What do you want?"

    I don't want to be
    autistic anymore.

    I wish you can give me
    a new li--me.

I could start my life all over
again and I wasn't autistic.

        There. Let me be
        a normal person.

I bet you all the damn people
I knew in middle school

and high school, they're all
in fricking college now.

    I'm not in college.

    That's what I wanted
    when I was in high school.

I dreamed of going to college,
and I'm not in college.

I wanted to go to college.
I wanted to go to college!

I don't--I think now I should
have graduated college!

    I should have been
    in college right now.

        I should have
graduated college right now.

    I know so many people
    that went to college,

and they're done right now.

    I can't hang out
    with people like that.

            I can't.

Matt: Why not?

    Because they're higher--
    they're higher than me.

    Look. They're up here.
    I'm down here.

    They're--I'm all
    the way down here.

    They're all the way up here.

    That's what I think.

Lenny: I want to get a girl

that's kind of lower than me.

    That's what I want.

    If I found a girl that
    had a job, had a car,

    had her own home,
    I can't be with her.

    She deserves to be with
    somebody better than me.

She's up here. I'm down here.

    That's the way I see it.
    It's hard, man.

    It's really hard
    to accept it, man.

    Yeah, this is--
    this is hard, man.

        This is tough.

    This is--this is probably
    one of the hardest things

    I have to go through
    in my life.

    Don't cry, man. Let me cry.

    I don't want to see
    a tear come out of your eye.

        It's hard.

        What do you think
        about me crying?

    What do you think the peop--

    the viewers could think
    about this?

            [Crying]

        It's emotional.

    I can't let that happen.

I got no job. I got no car.

I'm living with my parents.

I should be doing something.

I'm a good person, man.
I'm not a bad person, Matt.

        I'm a good guy.
        That's just--

    It hurts. It hurts, man.

    He once told me that...

    that, um--he said, "You ever
    walk into a room...

    and you know everybody's
    talking about you?"

    And he said that's how
    he feels every day

    when he leaves
    the house, you know?

            So, um...

    I just want my son
    to be happy.

    And, um, I think he needs
    to come to terms

        with who he is

    because he's not comfortable
    with who he is,

    and if he's not
    comfortable with who he is,

    I don't know how he could
    ever expect anybody else

        to be comfortable
        with who he is.

    Stephen, voice-over:
    I feel sad about Gita.

    She died last April.

    She had cancer. That's sad.

    She was laying down.
    She was laid to rest.

    I miss Gita. I miss Gita.

When Gita died, we went

to the--to work
to tell him.

It was on a workday,
and he was there,

and when I told him,

he just turned white
like a sheet.

He put his head
down on the table.

I could tell
he was very upset.

She was gone.

Matt: Do you feel like

you're still
in love with Gita?

    No. I stop loving
    someone--they die,

        because they die,

        because Gita died
        on April 9.

    No longer in love.

        Max: It is a big help
        for him to go back--

        go back to work.

Edith: We encouraged
him to pick up life

like...

normal, sort of.

    Stephen, voice-over:
    I fell in love with Gita

    for the past 20 years.

    And then gave--I gave
    Gita a hug.

    I gave Gita a hug.

I--I put my arms around her.

    Dave: In physics, we have
    something called

    electromagnetic spectrum--

        how much energy
        a wavelength has.

You go from radio waves to light

    to ultraviolet,
    x-rays, gamma rays.

    And then how I feel
    towards someone

is kind of on a similar scale.

You have different wavelengths

going from just physical lust,

    then you go--graduate from

    a general interest
    in the opposite sex.

Then you graduate from having
a specific intense crush

    on a specific person.

    Dave: And after that,
    it kind of evolves into

    another stage, which is
    the true love stage

and not having that deep crush
where you're thinking about her

    24/7 and you have
    a hard time sleeping

    because you're so much
    in love with her,

but it kind of graduates
into a more subconscious form.

    Let's say you're going
    from light waves

that you can basically see
to ultraviolet waves.

    They're still there,
    but you can't see them.

    But they're stronger.
    Is that making sense?

Lindsey: Are you sure
that was--

are you sure that was
the spot

where we did
that photograph?

            I want to say
            it was taken

            somewhere
            around here.

            Very--this is
            nostalgic, isn't it?

            Almost 8 years ago.

            It's always amazing
            when you look back

            in time, how things
            have grown and how

            our relationship
            has grown

            and what we've
            been through

            has been really
            amazing.

            That says something
            when you go

            for a relationship
            that long,

            that is a very
            strong signal

        that the relationship
        is meant to be.

        And at first, um, you
        were kind of confused

        as to where
        we were headed,

        and I remember
        you telling me

        you were--you would
        have been totally happy

            just pursuing
            your career

            and being a single
            woman,

            and then...

Remember that slide
you kind of show

on your presentation--

is it the
physics-related slide?

            Yes. Yes.

Where you have...

            the wavelengths.

The alpha and the beta
and the gamma?

            And the delta.

The delta.

And I think how I
viewed our experience

and our adventure
together

is that our wavelengths
might have been different

at different times--

        It was a mutual thing.

And I think

having those different
wavelengths

at different times
may have been

a significant
reason why

we both may have
struggled

to...

really understand where
we may be seeing ourselves

in the far future.

        But now I feel like

        our wavelengths
        are in sync.

I feel like
we've grown.

                We have.

And I want to
only go

by what's in here...

            Absolutely.
            In here, too.

and what's in here.

            And trust me,
            it's in here.

            It's in here

            and always will be.

            And I say that

            from the bottom
            of my heart.

            [Sigh]

[Laughs and cries]

            And it's OK to blush
            if you want to,

            but, um, understand
            if you do.

            But, uh, this has
            been a remarkable

        journey, and somebody
        as beautiful as you

        deserves the very best

        and a life of happiness
        together.

        And I would very much
        be honored...

        to have you as my wife.

        Will you marry me?

Yes, I will marry you.

            There you are.

            That's why I wore
            my vest--

            to conceal that.

I--I was wondering
about that.

            But definitely
            in the delta region

        where it's true love.

        That's the wavelength
        we're both in.

        "Your task is not
        to seek for love

    "but merely to seek
    and find all the barriers

    within yourself that
    you have built against it."

    That quote really
    resonates with my life.

    All the negative things
    that I heard on autism

growing up, it definitely made
me feel worthless or less.

    I had consistently
    set up barriers

    to protect myself.

It's very easy to not feel like
that you can trust people.

    I thought that perhaps

    Dave was holding back
    more than I was.

    But what I discovered
through a lot of introspection

    is that I was really
    holding back, too.

    Alex Trebek: This
    author's losing entry

    in a 1948 literary
    contest--

Who was Arthur C. Clarke?

        Alex: ...2001? Lars.

    Lars: Who is Clarke?

    Alex: Arthur C. Clarke.
    You are right.

    Lars: U.S. Cabinet, 200.

    Alex: Which Cabinet
    department,

    the Transportation
    Security Administration...

    Lenny: I'm gonna throw
    a penny in the water,

        make a wish.

    When I make my wishes,
    I make it clear

that I don't tell anybody, OK?

Hey, by the way, there's
some more ducks over there.

    Why don't you go
    film them all over there?

    Lenny: Got one minute
    left, by the way.

    When that one minute's
    over with, I'm gone.

    I got to go back.
    I like to get there early.

        I don't know.
    It's kind of fun doing this.

        6 weeks I've been
        working here at Flora.

    Here. Here's your--here's
    the one right here.

    A famous person that had
    a job like this

    when he was a young man
    was Kurt Warner.

    You don't know who
    Kurt Warner is?

    He's the--he's
    the football player--

he's the quarterback who played
for the Rams a long time ago.

    You don't remember how
    that Super Bowl happened

    where it was the last
    second on--

    they were one yard
    short of winning it?

    Well, he was the quarterback
    of that winning game.

    All right. I got
    to go back now. Sorry.

        Got to go.

    Sorry. Got to go back now.

    I'm back now. May I have
    a drink of water, please?

                    OK, ready?
            OK.

                    All right.

        [Plays note]

                So it starts
                here, OK?

                    Ready?

        Mm-hmm.

    [Playing "Heart and Soul"]

                Don't pound it.
                Just gently.

    ["Heart and Soul" continues]
