[woman narrator] <i>Hello my loves and
welcome to the Venus experience.</i>

<i>In this guided meditation</i>

<i>you are loved, you matter.</i>

<i>The wholeness that you are
looking for is within you.</i>

<i>The universe is trying
to tell you something.</i>

<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

<i>Ask yourself,
what are you running away from?</i>

[distant traffic humming]

[relaxing music]

[water rushing]

Oh my God.

I don't know why you still got
that thing in our house.

You know because she's inspired
a lot of my inspiration.

Oh!

Yo. Tarantulas...

[unintelligible chatter]

<i>â™ª White girl twerk,
white girl twerk... â™ª</i>

"Becky, can I get
a bottle? Bitch?"

Fuck your bottle.

[Hunter] Yo, this is crazy.
[Hendrix sighs]

What's that?

Another unfortunate letter.

I'm sorry. It'll come.

It'll happen.
Yeah.

Yo!
Yeah.

Yo! What's up, man?
What's up?

What's up?
How're you doing? Yeah, yeah.

You good? Good?
[Hendrix chuckles]

[both kissing]
[Hendrix] Ok.

[laughs]
[both kissing]

Hey! Yo!
There is nothing...

[Hendrix] What? It's a
free show.

[Johnny]...wrong, we need a
little bit of love, all right?

[calm music]

[upbeat hip hop music]

<i>â™ª Yeah, you can tell
the reaper I'm running late â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That Sidney Carter
said that nigga could wait â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª That nigga's been
sweeping, nigga, 90K â™ª</i>

I'm doing this little piece, man.

Got DJ Pete.
Peep the merch, peep the merch.

My ex-girlfriend.
Yeah. For sure.

What?
Yeah, she left me in some shit. [unintelligible]

[cross-talking]
what's up? What's good?

Check this shit out.

[car honking]
[loud thud]

[man] Shut up, nigga.
[unintelligible chatter]

[siren blaring]
[man in a beanie] Damn.

[man] What up?
Yo! That bitch looks mad familiar.

[cross-talking]

Bitches love
being called bitches,

it's a part of life.

Don't listen
to this stupid ass nigga.

[cross-talking]
Look like I have... I have a philosophy.

What's the philosophy?
Let's hear the philosophy.

Preach, brother.
Thank you for the claps. Thank you for the claps.

Thank you for the claps. Check it out.
[man] All right.

Most women want men
that run shit

not a sensitive man.
Said no woman ever.

Oh, so when you point at me you're
trying to say I'm a sensitive dude?

Are you still celibate?
Come, on man, chill.

Your energy is fucking my energy up
right now. I need you to fucking go

across the street.
Time out, nigga. Bye.

Stop playing and get

all this pussy
that's out here, homey.

Hey!

Hey.

Do you remember me?

Remember you...
you gave me a painting?

Was in this alley.
Got it.

I do remember you.

Yeah!
I do. I do remember you.

Oh, shit! That's so weird...
I know.

Hey, can I have a cigarette?


And a light? It's your turn.

Hold on.

Thank you.
Yeah.

That's crazy how you
just remember me like that.

Yeah.
Yeah.

I love your painting.

You did?
It felt very personal.

Yeah, it is.
'Cause it said, "Remember me on it", but you don't remember me.

So that's kind of fucked up. [chuckles]
[laughs]

You know, I once read that smoking
is a lazy man's meditation.

I used to read
a lot of self-help books.

But now I just have a therapist.

I'm gonna start meditating
and then stop smoking.

Yeah. No, word.
Meditation is... I meditate.

You do?
Meditate is... Yeah. It's...

You seem so enlightened.

I'm still smoking though. [laughs]
That's true.

Yeah. I know,
you can meditate and smoke...

Yeah.
Yeah.

Well, do you live
around here or something?

No, I... I live in New York.

Got it.

I've just been here
for a few days...

...cleaning out my dad's stuff.

He died recently... so...

I'm sorry to hear that.

Sorry. I know you're probably
like, "Who's this crazy bitch

telling me all of her stuff?"
No. Why would I call you a bitch?

I don't even know you to call you a bitch.
No, no, no. Don't worry.

I... No... I'm thinking... You said
I think you're a bitch...

Don't worry, bitch, fuck and ho.

Whoa!
Those are like my three favorite words.

Wow, that's... that's aggressive.
Yeah.

I'm Ruby.
Hey, Ruby, what's up? I'm Hunter.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

I'm a hugger. [laughs]

Oh.
[Ruby] Mm...

Did you feel that?
Yeah, I felt it.

I love hugs.
Yeah, sure.

No, come on. You felt it too.

Didn't that feel...
No... It was nice.

It was very nice.
It was a good energy exchange.

There's nothing like
a good ass hug.

A good ass hug.
And I love your hair. I love your style.

Mm.
You have a very cool style.

Very cool hair.
Thank you.

So cool. How do you
keep it like that?

naps and just...

...got stuck together.

do your hair like that?

[both laughing]

[siren blaring]

This area has changed a lot.

Yeah, gentrification.

It's cute.

It's cute?
It's cute. I mean...

...it was a shit hole and now
it's... it's getting cute.

Shit hole? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Gentrification is a hole...

I wouldn't say that if
I were you. I think there's...

...many things
to gentrification.

Can you boil that down for me?

Meaning, like,
gentrification is like...

...people have been living
there for years and years,

and then they get kicked out,
and then new people move in

with money, and so...

I wasn't thinking
about it in terms of the people,

I was thinking about it....
No... I'm not... Yeah... I'm not...

...in terms of the way that it looks.
Got it.

Yeah. I'm not trying to make
you feel better about that.

That's a very... That's a conversation
we probably shouldn't touch.

Who?
No. I'm just saying that... that

gentrification is a conversation
that you... you said it's cute

and I don't... I think that it's just...
That... You can't really say that.

Like, you don't... You know, people lose
their homes. Anyway. Whatever. Uh...

I think you're missing
the point here. [chuckles]

You're making me feel like
an awful person.

Yeah. Yeah.
I hate change.

Change is fucking up
my whole life right now.

Fuck change, fuck change,
and fuck gentrification.

Fuck it.

Hold the fists up, girl.
You... That... I mean [chuckles]

Hold the fists up.

[sighs] Ok, Hunter.
Uh, yeah.

Woo!

It's getting late. All right.

It was nice meeting you.
It was cool, yeah.

It was a really
cool little chat.

It's like a crazy university.

It's like... Not to sound cheesy,

but it's like,
I met you over there, like...

Maybe I'll meet you again.
Yeah, maybe.

I know.
[Hunter vocalizes]

Hey.
Yeah.

When you meet me again...
Yes.

...remember who I am.
Mm-hmm.

Maybe, for sure. Yeah, for sure.

I won't forget who you are.

Ruby.
I will remember you, Miss Ruby.

Yes. Have a good day.

[Ruby] You too. Bye
[Hunter] Cool. Bye.

Peace. Take care.
Bye.

[gentle electronic music]

Hey!

Hmm?

Do you want to hang out?
What's up?

Do you want to hang out with me?

Like, now?

Like... yeah.

You're not afraid I'm like
a serial killer or something?

[suspenseful music]

Little bitch.
You're mine now, motherfucker.

Motherfucker!
[whip cracks]

[exhales deeply]

[Hunter's muffled voice]

[Cleo moans and chuckles]

[Hunter chuckles and chokes]

Yo, yo, Cleo! Cleo! [mumbles]

Yo, baby!

What's wrong?
Make sure I don't...

I'm just saying,
how far you want this to go?

It's cool, but literally...

[Cleo shushes]
Ok.

I thought you're into this.

No.

[speaking Chinese]

[speaking Chinese]

beautiful woman putting me on.

Hunter...

...would you please
stop filming me?

Yeah, I'm... I'm really excited.

Thank you so much
for believing in me.

You know, my first show?

I owe you everything, baby.

Good for you.

Is this your new painting?

I don't get the new direction.

Keep it about the struggle...

...and Black rage.

That's what it sells.

Look...

...that's what
the people want to feel. Ok?

Not this one?

[somber music]

[mellow music]

Yo.

[woman sighs]
Yo! What up?

What's up? Johnny's fuck ass.

We were supposed to go eating, and he flaked.
[chuckles]

What's up with your seat belt?
Word. Yo! Don't say that shit like that.

That's fucked up.
Yo! Stop. Why are you gonna talk about my car like that?

You better chill.
Who's giving a fucking ride?

Yeah!

Ah, ah, ah, ah!
[chuckles]

Uh, hello?

How are you?

Hi.
I'm Hunter Leonards.

Um, yeah, I'm one of the feature
artists here trying to put a...

just figuring out where I place my stuff.
Right.

I'll be down there.

All right.

Hey, what's up? How're you?

Good.
Good.

Yeah... I'm so, yeah, I'm...

I have some paintings
that I need to put up.

Cool. Um.

So we're thinking of setting up
your stuff over here.

All these paintings...
I have a lot...

I have... more in the car.
Oh! That's...

You have more than... one.

I... I... I have all of them.

There must be a mistake. Do you want to
call Cleo? Can you just give her a call,

and make sure...
Actually I just spoke to her, and she said

you only get one piece in this show.
Are you sure?

That's like weird.
'Cause I just actually...

...I just saw her. You s...

Ok.

[somber music]

How are you?

I'm good.

Really? [scoffs]

Be real.

I am being honest.
It's like... Uh...

I'm so tired of that bitch.

Yeah. Don't call... Don't call her a bitch...
For real.

She's crazy.
I know... I know she's... She's crazy as fuck.

And not like... I'm not just
saying that...

I know men like to call crazy
all the time, but, like,

she's legit crazy.
No, she... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

But I... Listen...

Listen, Henny... Henny,
I love her, all right?

Just like you love Johnny, I love her.
[scoffs]

[laughs]
I'm sorry.

Stop laughing at me.
I can't even take you seriously when you say that.

Come on, now.

Love is not a transaction.

Come on, now. Why you gotta do that? Don't.
[laughs]

Thanks for meeting me.

Of course.

I've just been kind
of going through it.

What's up?


Well, but now... You're crazy.
But, you know, always...

He don't believe in me.

You know, he just, um...

...he signed somebody
else to his label.

He didn't listen to my song yet.

For real. It's like...

I don't know. I'm just tired.

I think...
I think I need a break.

Like, I just need to go and...

...figure out...

...me again,
and like... [exhales]

...my own self-worth, you know.
Like, just...

I feel like we both need space.

But, you know, one day.

Mm-hmm.

One day Johnny
is going to see my potential.

He's gonna put me on.

He would want
to make me his girlfriend too.

We're playing.
Yeah, one day, Henny,

You're gonna be
successful as shit.

You'll make a lot of money.

[upbeat music]

And anybody in life that doesn't
allow it, just fuck them.

Right?

Money would be cute.

I like money.
[both laugh]

[as Henny] Money will be cute.
That's you...

I love you, yo.
I love you too.

We're gonna do this shit.

Ah! We're gonna do this shit!

Hendrix, we gonna
do this shit. Yeah!

We're gonna do this shit!
We're gonna do this shit!

We're gonna do this shit!

We're gonna do this shit!

Yo, you got some weed?
Are you serious?

You got some weed?
Uh, yeah, I'm Ok.

[lively music]

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

[music stops]

[birds cawing]

<i>Hello, my loves.</i>

<i>Welcome to the Venus experience.</i>

<i>I'm happy you made the choice</i>

<i>to nurture
your body, mind and spirit</i>

<i>by meditating today.</i>

<i>Sit in a comfortable, quiet
place to begin our session.</i>

[electronic music]
[Cleo] I found you the painting.

I found the star.

[man] It's beautiful.
[Cleo] Do you believe that?

[man] It's interesting.
[Cleo] Look.

[Cleo] Do you like the color?
[man] It's nice.

Hey. I was looking for you.

You said you wanted to talk.

I give you good news.

You know the French collector,
Pierre, I told you about?

He's here.

And he... listen,
listen! Good news!

He loves your painting.

That's cool.

Listen to me.
It's what you always wanted.

You get paid for.

You get paid.

Precisely. We both will.

It's delicious. It's happy time.

Come on. Give me a kiss.

I love those lips.

[mellow hip hop music]

It's very special.

Hey, Pierre, meet Hunter.

Hunter, meet Pierre.

<i>EnchantÃ©e.</i>
Nice to meet you.

This is the artist.

I love your painting.
It's perfect.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

You know, I've been
telling Hunter that those

explorations of Black effect

are exactly the social political
aesthetic interventions

we need in this moment.
I agree.

I love it.

I want to buy it.

[clicks tongue and sighs]
I'm sorry.

It's actually already sold, sir.

But thank you.
I'm glad you liked it.

[music intensifies]

[music stops]

Where's my fucking lighter?

Oh, fuck.

Yo, uh, can I borrow your light?

Thank you.

[siren blaring in distance]

Thank you...
You're welcome.

...for sure.

Did you paint that?

Yeah.
I like it.

It's cool.

You can have it.

Really?

Thanks.

Wow. So Basquiat of you.

You know, Henny, you know
what it is that, "Oh, I need...

the Black struggle, and I need
to stay in the Black box,

and I'm like, "What the fuck
you know about being Black?"

Fuck putting my art in a box.

True.

I don't like being
put in a box either.

At least you know your art
is worth something now, right?

I mean as clichÃ© as it sounds,
when one door closes, another one opens.

All right?
Look at me and my music.

I don't know what the hell I'm
out here doing. But I'm doing it.

Right?

Henny, real talk,
those doors are an illusion.

Do you understand that?
They're not real.

But you only need one...

...or you can manifest your own.

Well, you weren't in love
with Cleo. No shade, like,

I think you were
just using each other.

Like she was using you...

...as a boy toy.

Like, look at your patterns.

Every time
you meet a pretty girl,

and you put her
on a pedestal, and then

she emasculates you, I mean...
Fuck.

...that's your pattern, like...
I do that.

Everybody has a pattern
and shit. I'm not saying

mine is any better.
I gotta stop, I gotta stop.

I gotta stop, yo.

You do.
I'm done with this. This is my life.

You feel me?
This is my fucking life.

True.
I'm gonna focus on me.

I'm gonna get my shit together.

I don't want to talk to no one.

I'm not falling
in love ever again.

I'll be fucking celibate.

Maybe you should be celibate
with that bottle first.

Why the fuck, you act like
I have a fucking problem

or something?
Don't come at me like that.

Why would you say that?
I'm just saying.

Maybe give up sex.

Maybe give up drinking and drugs
for a month, and see how you feel.

Just like a cleanse.
You know, just a reset.

That's all.

It's time to focus on your art.
That's right.

I'm... Hmm, I'm so fucking ready.
Time to be happy.

Do your fucking art. The only relationship...
I'm so...

...you need to be focused on

is you, God...

...the universe,
and your art. 'Cause...

...we're some fucking
self-made bitches out here.

You just called me a bitch.
[Hendrix laughs]

[upbeat ambient music]

You know, this is really random.

[Hunter] What're you doing? You're taking a selfie?
[Ruby] Yeah.

I thought you
don't take selfies.

No, I'm not really
into social media.

You know, I just don't see the
point, and because... I don't know.

Not my thing.
What does that mean?

You're an artist?
You curate content for a living,

similar to the way
that I do.

How do you make money if you don't
curate content that people like?

Um, I don't know.
I don't know. I paint and then

sell paintings, trying to get
my shit out there. Do odd jobs.

How do people see
your art then? That's just...

That's really no way
to market yourself.

So, you're not making any money.

And do you live in your car?

[both chuckles]
[Ruby] It all makes sense now.

No, I just don't believe in
blasting every detail

of my personal life
in social media.

[Ruby] I love L.A.
[Hunter] I know.

see the Hollywood sign right there.

Ok. I know what we should do.

What?

We're going to the beach.
The beach?

We're going to the beach.

[hip hop music]

Can you help me open your door?

Twice pull?
No, wait, I got it. I got it.

Why do you make it look so easy?

[Hunter unintelligible]
[Ruby sighs]

[Hunter] Make sure your feet are in.
[Ruby] They're in.

[Hunter] Now, close. All right?
[Ruby] Yep.

[Hunter] Safe? Put on your seat belt.
[Ruby] You almost...

...you almost hit your Tiki man.
Put on your seat belt.

And your bowl, but...
Put on... Listen, don't touch anything.

Is my... You... You can't
come a person's place...

[Ruby] Also...
[Hunter] You can't... Listen.

Hey, this is gonna be cool,
but you can't get

into that man's place, and start
moving things around, all right?

Listen, I'm just letting you
know that you need to get there.

I've got the map.

[relaxing music]

What are you doing, yo?

[Ruby chuckles] Taking a selfie.

Oh, you're taking a selfie?
Yeah.

[Hunter] Shit.
So, what? It's good for your brand.

Your brand?
What?

Nothing. I'm just
saying that I...

next time just ask before you...
What are you doing?

Smile!
Put it down!

[Ruby chuckles] I can't
see what I'm doing anyway.

Wanna get some ice cream?

Yeah.

Hey, let's go get your camera.

All right. Let's go.

[Ruby laughs]
Yo, we're like kind of...

Ooh!

where did this come from?
What are you doing?

I love bikes, especially pink bikes.
You don't...

That's not your bike.
Yeah, but it's Ok. Get on.

No, I'm not getting on that...
Come on, get on the bike, get on the bike.

Get on the bike, you don't
trust my driving sense?

No, I'm just saying
this bike is really small.

I just want to see if we can do it.
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

[girl] Hey, you stole my bike, lady! My bike!
[both chuckles]

Oh, God, jeez, I'm sorry little girl.
[Hunter chuckles]

Lady, get your own bike.
Ok.

Take your bike back, be careful.
Don't talk to strangers.

Yeah, we're sorry. Don't tell anybody.
Stay away from...

You should be
ashamed of yourselves.

Just go. What are you doing?
[Ruby chuckles]

What? I was...
How are you gonna take a little girl's bike?

No, I was taking it
for like a loop.

No, but this is Venice, you get
banged on, you can't just

take some random little girl's bike. I told you.
She was literally...

You think she's gonna beat me up?
You look ridiculous right now.

<i>I love the camera.</i>

<i>I love creating memories.</i>

You... you need to be a cheetah.

A cheetah?
Yeah.

[Ruby huffs]
[Hunter laughs]

All right, I'm done filming you.
Woo.

I'm done filming you.

[Ruby sighs]

I know what I'm good at,
gonna stick to that.

So nice.

Doesn't it feel relaxing?

Uh, it does. [groans]
Like...

...an overwhelming
sense of calm.

You know?

[deeply inhales and exhales]

[both laugh]

No, uh, say, like, the water,
when it comes to the ocean,

water takes all
your pain, worries.

[inhales and exhales]

Yeah.
Do you hear that sound? Hear that sound?

Doesn't it just calm you?

It's like you
throw all your issues.

[Ruby breathes deeply]
And the ocean just takes it back.

Yeah.

How old are you?

I'm 33.
Damn. You're old as fuck.

Damn. You just...
I didn't know I was fucked.

Well, I just had a quarter
life crisis because I turned 25.

[laughing] Quarter life crisis!
But 33. Damn.

That's really good. [laughs]

Something funny?

Do you have a girlfriend?

Um, no, no. Not at the moment.

Really? Huh.

Any particular reason?

Gonna take a little break.

Taking a heartbreak?

[both laugh]
That's what they call it.

So what do you
want to do after this?

Actually, I wanna see
if you wanna hang out more.

My best friend,
she is having a birthday party,

and she's an artist.
She has really dope music.

And it's gonna be super low key, not a
lot of people, but if you want to come.

I mean you don't have to come. You
don't have to feel pressure or whatever.

[Ruby screams]
What?

[lively music]

[lively music continues]


I'm really sorry about your car.

Now I gotta clean
my fucking car.

Now I gotta clean up my fucking car. Look what you did.
Oh, shit.

I know.
I have to clean up.


I thought
that napkin was for me.

Done. Here. All right.

[both laugh]
Give me this.

Oh, God.. So, I have to go to
this party like this?

Well, yeah, you're fine.

[chuckles] I'm sorry about your windshield.
No, it's all good.

I'm your coach. Wait, wait, wait.
let me get it, let me get it... Oh, shit.

[both grunting]

All right. Hold on. I think
I have something in the car.

[muffled party music]

So you live here?

Yeah. This is like me... sorry.

Me and my roommate,
we moved in here.

It's like a little compound situation.
Cool.

[upbeat music]

Oh, shit. Hey!
Hey, honeys.

What's good? There you are.
[Hunter] Happy birthday.

Oh, hello, gorgeous. Who's this?

Uh, we met... She's basically...
He gave me a painting

and we're basically
best friends now. I'm Ruby.

Oh hi.
That sounds about right.

I'm Henny. Nice to meet you.

You're gorgeous.
Thank you, likewise.

Would you like a splash?

Sure.
I think we're gonna be friends.


I was messaging with this 22-year-old
on a fucking app the other day.

Offered me
a threesome right away.

Dude. I'm not even kidding you.

[laughs]
Are you going to re-tell?

Hey. You want... Hey you...
Hey.

Yeah, of course.

You go in that. Go, go ahead.
Ok, gangster.

She's not a lightweight.

Cheers.
Cheers.

Where is your drink?
Uh, I'm good.

I'm not drinking.
Why?

Because I just don't
feel like drinking.

Mmm.

You know one of those nights
you just wanna get fucked up?

Just like fuck it, fuck it.

Like, fuck the pain away.

Like Peaches...
Whatever, but yeah.

[music continues]

Ok. Well, children, I'm gonna go
to the attic and play my song.

Hey.
Damn.

[party music]

This is vibey.

I like what
you've done with the place.

[Ruby's unintelligible chatter]

[fast-paced rap]

Ah! [laughter]

Oh, she's like an IG
influencer. I followed her.

Damn, I knew I recognized her.
The IG influencer.

Y'all gonna fuck?
Oh, gross.

Shut the fuck up, bro.
Why are you always...

Do you want a sip?
No.

Man, I'm trying to get these bitches, bro.
Really?

Oh, yeah.
Don't start on me, girl.

Oh, yeah, I forgot, I forgot
you on your silver shit.

Yeah, and you on your fuck shit.

[hip-hop music]

Can you open this? These nails.

Just thinking who's out of nuts?

Come on, Hunter, relax.

Last I checked,
my dad just died...

...and I'm trying
to get turned up. Come on.

Loosen up bit.

[cheering & applauding]

[cheering & applauding]

Who wants some cake?
Who wants some cake?

Yo! Can I get everybody's
attention, please.

D.J. Beat.

Um...

I know you're all here
to celebrate my girl's birthday

so I want to thank you
for coming out. Henny?

I know you and I have been through
ups and downs through the past.

What? Five fucking years?

Um... come on, get in here. Get in here.
Babe, what are you doing?

I have watched her go
through so much in her life

and she always strives for greatness
and now I'm gonna help her.

I'm gonna manage her.
So, everybody give it up

for my girlfriend, Henny!

D.J. Beat, drop that shit!
Everybody, let's go!

[dance music]

You're Ok. All right.

Do I have any boogers?

No. You don't have any
boogers. Let me see. No.

All right. Watch your head.
Watch your head.

Yo, hey,

No, no. I'm gonna get an Uber.
No, no, no, no.

You know you threw up in your shoes, right?
Throw up?

Yeah, you did.
Are you kidding me?

I just got these.

You could put this on
tomorrow...

Thanks.
...when you wake up.

This shirt is
especially for you.

What does that mean?
Choicetarian?

Yeah. Where did you get that?
I made it.

Like vegetarian?

No, it's a, it's a...

It's like I choose
to do what I want to do.

How I want to do it.
Like with food.

No, with my life.

Same thing.

<i>â™ª Take me now, throw me down
baby, take me up, down â™ª</i>

I'm really sorry.

Sorry for what?

[mumbles]
What's wrong?

I'm sorry that I let you down

and that I embarrass you.

You didn't let me down and you
didn't embarrass me. All right?

Thanks for being a friend.
Nah, of course.

Just get some... Hang on, let me get you some... Wait.
No.

Listen, go to bed.
I just really don't want to be alone.

What's wrong? Why...

It's like nobody gives you the benefit of
the doubt because you're Ruby Math bitch.

Do you think I'm good enough?

I think you're more
than good enough.

I think you're special.
I think you're smart.

I think you're talented.

You've been a bit
of sunshine in my life for...

...since we've been hanging out.

Really?
Yeah.

So, go to bed, all right?

If you need anything, I'll be in the next room.
Ok.

All right.
I'll see you in the morning.

<i>â™ª Fuck, love me relentless â™ª</i>

...good night and I wanted to make it really special.
Mm-hmm.

And I will retract the girlfriend statement.
[chuckles]

Shut up.

[dance music]

Ah. Ha-ha.
Hi.

Sorry.
I'm creeping around.

it's only me creeping on y'all, I'm creepy.
Sorry, dude, sorry.

Yeah. Um... where's your friend?

<i>â™ª Take me now, throw me down â™ª</i>

She was kind of, like, twisty.

Twisted. I'm a little twisted.

No sex.

No sex stuff.

She's, uh, sleeping.

She's tired.

Oh, good boy.

<i>â™ª ...down, down, down... â™ª</i>

Do you guys need any help?

No, we got this. We'll...

We'll finish it tomorrow.
We're gonna figure this out.

All right. Love you.

Tonight was fun.
[Henny] Thank you for tonight.

Yeah, for sure.
[Johnny] Yeah.

Night, guys, have a good night.

Johnny got a girlfriend.

All right, don't fuck up.

[Henny laughs]
I'll kill you, bro.

All right. You guys have a good night.
[Johnny] Good night.

[gentle music]

I don't wanna do this.
Let's just do it tomorrow.

Come on. You can tell me
I'm a good girl.

[relaxing music]

[music continues]

Hunter?
[music ends]

Hunter?

Hunter?

Hunter, are you here?

Hunter, can you drive me home?

Sure. Let's go.

[upbeat electronic music]

That was fun.
That was fun.

[chuckles] What?
Nothing.

Here, let me give you my number.

Unless you don't want
to ever see me again.

Can you unlock it?
Yeah, just use my code.

Ok. And then as,
"Ruby, call every day."

So, don't forget to do that.

[fast-paced rap music]

Where's your little girlfriend?

What are you talking about?

Man, no.

She is young.

She followed me though.

What? She followed you?
Um-hmm.

That's weird.
She's one of them famous influencers.

When we were chilling
she was taking so many selfies.

I was like, "Yo, you got to be
present." She's not present.

I see why, it's part of her job.

You like her.
What?

Oh...
She damn sure didn't forget about you.

What? What?
All right.

100,000 likes?
She posted?

She posted my painting.
Uh-hmm.

That's hilarious.

That's crazy.
She writes...

..."Sometimes you get a ray of
light from a strange artist."

Oh! She's a deep one.

[both laugh]

Ah! Are you sure?
That's hilarious.

She's just posting
your art and shit.

What did you do to her.

Wow. You got your work
cut out for you, honey.

What?
Uh-huh.

Ah!
Careful with that one.

Yeah.
She's now posting your art and shit.

Yo, that's crazy.
That's funny.

That's crazy.
Don't slide up on her DMs, Romeo.

[background party noises]

[exhales deeply]

Hunter, the artist
that doesn't sell his art.

I'm Pierre.

Yeah.

Well, yeah, man,
I'm sorry about that.

No, no, no, dude, I get it.

I get it. You're a real artist.
You're not led by money.

It's honorable.
Yeah, but I don't know if that's a smart thing, Pierre.

You know, that's my space.
Oh, this space is yours.

Oh, this is dope, man. Very cool space.
Do you like it?

Well, thank you.
It used to be my art studio,

but, uh, I don't have your
talent so I don't paint anymore.

Look...


If you ever need anything,
I mean a matter of fact...

Know now that you have something
because this is my space.

See you soon, Hunter.

Ladies and gentlemen. <i>Bonjour.</i>

I'm Pierre.

I love this love.
[chuckles]

I... I have something
very special today.

Something that you may
really much enjoy.

It's hard for me to explain because
it only needs to be experienced.

I'm gonna introduce someone
that creates something that

is... [unintelligible]
is something that,

again, can only be felt.

[glass dings]

Shush.

Everybody breathe
into your belly...

...and exhale with an "ah."
[all] Ah!

[glass dings]

As we come to the end...

...I want to thank all of you for
coming here releasing with us today.

We are supposed to live
a full ultimate life.

The good, the bad, all of it.

We are all here to play a role.

Remember... we are loved.

We are light... we are present.

I've never done
anything like that before.

I know because you haven't been
hanging out with me.

True.
It was cathartic, right?

So cathartic. [laughs]
Very cathartic.

See, that's when you hang out with me.
Good for the soul.

Good for the soul.

Ok.
I feel, like, liberated on a whole other level.

That's great.
Don't you?

Yeah. You want to just chill for a second?
Yeah.

Actually, I feel like I need to,
like, come down from that.

Yeah, thanks for taking me.
Of course.

I was a little
skeptical at the beginning.

Sorry about that.
But that was so fun.

Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.

[both laugh]


Yo.
Hunter.

So what are you doing, yo?

I'm just saying,
what are you doing?

Are you gay?
Yo.

I'm not kidding. Are you gay?

I don't understand.
What am I missing here?

Yo, Ruby.
Why are you so awkward?

What's the deal?
Ruby. Listen.

[scoffs]
I'm not like any of these dudes you meet.

Ruby, all right?
You need to understand that.

Ok, so you're not into it,
That's fine.

No. It's not that
I'm not into it.

Of course you're an attractive
girl, but it's like

I'm not gonna play
this game with you.

I'm just trying to like...
You don't have to say anything else.

I get it. You're not into it.
No, it's Ok 'cause you're used to getting what you want.

'Cause you're an internet model.
So you should just get anything you want.

What does that have to do
with me being my... What?

You're an asshole.
Internet model?

I don't come at you like that.
Please.

I don't even know you
to be arguing like this.

You know what? You're so fucked up.
Ok, I am fucked up.

Trying to say that
I'm an Instagram model.

I built myself from the ground.

Get out.
Fuck you.

Ok. Bye.

Your junkie ass car with
the door that doesn't work.

Fuck.

Yo, yo, Ruby.
Where are you going?

I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.
I'm getting an Uber.

Why, are you mad? Just because you can't figure me out?
Yeah.

Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving.

Just get back in the car.

Just get back in the car, Ruby.
I'm sorry.

Just because I didn't try
to kiss you, huh?

Ruby, maybe you need
to respect yourself.

Respect myself?

Yeah, respect yourself.
How dare you?

You don't know enough about my situation
to tell me what to respect. Fuck you!

I'm leaving
and don't fucking follow me.

Chill. Chill please, chill.
I am chill!

[police siren]

What's the problem?
Ma'am?

Is everything Ok?
Yes!

Have you ever seen
two adults argue?

Obviously we've seen that,
ma'am. I need to step over here.

We're trying to make sure everything is Ok.
For what reason, sir? Really?

Do you know who I am? Google me.

I'm reaching into my pocket to get my...
Oh no, you...

No, don't give them shit.
If you're smart, give me your ID.

No, chill.
No, no, no, no.

You're not giving them anything.
You ever seen two... Ok.

That's not happening.
He's not giving your ID.

Would you just chill?
Hey! Hey!

No, no, no.
He's not giving you shit!

Don't give him anything.
He's not giving you anything.

Get your hands off me.
What, have you never seen two... your touching me!

Ruby. Ruby!
He's touch... not touching me.

Touching me, harassment.
Get your hands out of my face.

Do you want me
to file a harassment?

How does that sound, sir?

Officer, badge number 12575.

Yeah, that's right.
You're gonna get in trouble.

That's right, harassment.

So rude.

Have a nice night, ma'am.

What?

Cops can be such
fucking asshole sometimes.


Hope you're Ok.

That could have went
really bad, Ruby.

[mellow hip-hop music]

<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

<i>And I wish you the best.</i>

<i>No. Thanks for taking me home.</i>

<i>You are oil.</i>

[Hunter] <i>I'm oil?</i>

<i>But you isolate yourself.</i>

<i>Do you think you are water?</i>

more free-flowing than you are.</i>

<i>So you're an ocean.</i>

Ruby, because we're 75% water.

Do it again, do it slowly.

No, I don't want to do it anymore.
Why?

What's wrong?

I feel like I can't shit.

No, I don't want to do... That was weird.
Hey, you're scaring me.

I'm scared, I'm gonna pop.
Just let it out. You need a hug.

[mutters indistinctly]
Bubbles calm.

but I don't want it to pop like that.

Doesn't this feel nice?

"What am I doing with my life?"

Do you need me to pump you up?

Yeah. What's that?

It's like what friends do when
people forget who they really are.

Oh.

Ok. You are...
Go ahead.

...an artist.
An artist.

You are so talented.

I am so talented.

You are a visionary.

I am a visionary.

You have amazing lips.

I have amazing lips.

Your hair is so sick.

My hair is so sick.
It's dope. Um-hmm.

You're getting good. See,

This is called the pump up.
Yeah.

Yeah.

This color is so, so good on us.

I need a nap.
No, no, no.

I need a nap.
No, come on.

Fuck. Oh, shit.
No, no, no, no, no.

Come on.

I refuse to let you
get boring on me.

All right. All right, Ruby.

No, no, no, no.
I'm going to go to sleep.

No, no, no, no.
I'm gonna try and sleep in.

No.

I'm tired. I'm tired.

Do you want me to throw you back in the pool?
I'm feeling sleepy.

Come on, let it go.
I'm really tired.

Thank you.

Let me chill.

You're mad cool
and I'm going to sleep.

Peace.

Hang loose.

[birds chirping]

How do you feel?

You look really good
in this light.

[Hunter] Are you ever present?
[Ruby] I am being present.

[Hunter] No, you're not.
I'm in the presence of an artist.

Yeah. Ok.

Are you ever present
when you have your camera?

Don't make fun
of the way I run my business.

I am a content creator.
This is my art.

People enjoy the things I create.
It's exactly like your job.

You have to sharpen that shit.

[relaxing music]

You want to go upstairs?

Sure.

[relaxing music continues]

[music intensifies]

[music fades]

Oh.
Good morning.

What's up?
Be careful. It's hot.

Oh, yes. It's hot as shit.
I can tell you've been celibate for a while.

Yeah. Then don't make it weird.

I'm not. Honestly,
I was, like, impressed.

[laughs]
What?

Shit, I have to pack.

Yeah. So...
[sighs]

Sweet, I'm gonna miss you.
I know. I was thinking the same thing.

You can come with me
if you want.

What? To New York?

Yeah.

I'll come with you.
You want to... Really?

Yeah, I've always
wanted to go to New York.

I actually have a bunch
of people you can meet.

Yeah. I don't want just them.

Oh, so sweet. Me neither.

[engine running]

[sounds muffled]

[thunder rolling]

Ok.
I'm not going to get hurt.

I don't understand why you making a big deal.
Ok.

It just feels fast. It's like...

It's always 0 to 100.
It just feel like you're doing

that thing that you do
again. Like...

Ok.
Every time a girl comes in your life,

you forget about who you are,
you drop everything for her

and then I'm left to, like,
help you pick up the pieces.

Yeah, but that's what friends are. But I'm trying
to tell you that it's different this time.

It's crazy. You're making this a lot bigger
than it is. You're making this a big deal.

She has some people in the art
scene that I could meet.

All right? That's the only
reason why I'm going.

I'm going there. I'm gonna
hustle. I'm gonna chill.

Which I should be doing.
She's just trying to help me. That's it.

Like Cleo was trying
to help you?

You need to trust me.
Ok.

Ok. You need to trust me. All right.
All right, relax, relax.

You love her.
It's different.

Most different.

Ok.

Ok.
It's different.

All right?
All right.

I love you.
I love you too.

And, and I... listen,
I appreciate you.

I appreciate you caring,
but it's like...

I just don't want you to get
hurt you. That's it.

Yo, I'm not going to get hurt.
Right.

I'm not going to get hurt, yo.

I love you.

[dance music]

[music continues]

Where? What club is this?

[Hunter] Watch your head.
[Ruby] Are we getting a night cab?

You didn't tell me
you were taking me home.

[Hunter] I am taking...
[Ruby] You're so boring.

Oh wow.
You need to go to bed.

Well...

Put your feet here.
Go to bed. You're tired.

So, do you want to be
best friends?

I want to be best friends. But I need
you to go to sleep. You want some water?

No.
Ok.

Snacks only. Like pizza?
Sh-shh.

Do you like me?

Of course I like you.

orange and 60 in the black.

Let's start with the black.
I ordered silk.

The jumpsuits have always been
in silk. You gave me chiffon.

Hello.

This guy is such a dick.

Ok. I'll be done soon.

Oh, and I set a meeting for you
with my art friend.

He's great. You'll love him.
And he's a big deal.

So don't be late.
I texted you the info.

Yes, I'm still here.

[calm piano music]

Uh, Francisco?

What's up, man?
Hold up.

Yeah, I'm, uh, Ruby's friend.

The artists that... I sent you
an email about my work.

My art, remember?

Oh... Hunter.

Yeah.
Ruby's friend.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Goddamn that girl was so hot,
huh? Ruby? Ooh-hoo-hoo.

Yeah, I know.
Anyways, man, my work.

Like, I'm really excited to get your
feedback and tell me what you think.

well, I liked
your earlier stuff.

Uh, that shit
was Black experience.

That was some real shit.

The shit that I saw, that was
some real Black struggle shit.

I want to see...

...I want to see what else
he had in that field.

Let me explain you this.

We don't listen to JAY-Z
and 2pac to hear about them

explore life, nah, I want to
hear about where they came from.

You know what I mean?
That's Black strength.

Not Black exploration.

We come from
the gutter around here.

That's what's up.
We want to sell that.

That's... that's the streets,
that's what it is.

So, what I saw.
I didn't hear your voice.

I want to see that.
I want to hear.

I want to feel. I want to taste.

I want to touch
that Black voice.

I want that.

I didn't see that in that email.

I want some real shit. So
when you work on that. Get it.

Yeah, man. All right, yo.
Yeah.

Thank you for letting me come.
I appreciate it. It was cool.

You know.
Thanks for checking out my shit.

And, um, yeah, man,
enjoy your day, brother.


Hey, the handle turns
to the right, to the right.

All right. Yeah.
Yeah, thanks, man.

[upbeat hip hop music]

Hold up, baby. What's up? How are you?
[Ruby] Hey.

Oh, my God. What is that smell?
My bad. You stepped on my toe.

Sorry.
It's Ok.

These shoes are really painful.

I was just making you dinner. That's all.
I can see that. I can smell it.

Yeah.
For sure. [laughs]

I'm making, uh, a shrimp pesto,
garlic, lemon, fettuccine Alfredo.

So sweet of you. Really appreciate that.
Thank you.

But one, I don't cook in here,
and I'm allergic to shellfish.

Oh.
Yeah, it's Ok.

Don't worry.
I was just trying to make you dinner

'cause I knew you
had a long day. My bad.

It's totally fine.
I can order something

and I'll probably... I'll just go
open all the windows. [chuckles]

Don't worry.
So you don't like the smell of garlic.

No, not in my sheets, probably not.
Oh, that's crazy, yeah.

Let me know if you want anything from the delivery.
Yeah, no, I'm good.

My bad. If I knew
you didn't like garlic,

I wouldn't have made,
I wouldn't... my sorry, my bad.

[mellow hip hop music]

How did the meeting
with Francisco go?

Oh, with your boy?
Yeah.

Oh, dude likes
my old stuff better,

he said, the Black experience.

You know the...
the Black struggle.

Yeah, I mean,
he's an interesting cat.

He clearly has his agenda.

You know, I just wanna...
I just wanna make art.

I completely understand
what you're saying.

I don't think you should ever feel
like you have to do one thing.

I just think, I think Francisco
was really smart

and I think he knows
what people want to see.

The Black experience
is cool for people.

People think being Black
is really cool

and you should lean into that.

Being Black is cool, Ruby?

It's not... I'm not saying
that the Black is cool.

I'm saying that...
I'm not trying to offend you.

No, you're not, you're not offending me.
I just want you to hear me,

like, I want you
to understand me.

I understand what
you're saying. I'm sorry.

I'm just saying, I don't want to
just make art about being oppressed.

I don't want to make art about being, like,
angry and, like, a statistic, you know?

If it's working, why change it?
That's really what I mean.

Yeah, but, Ruby, like, honestly
I just wanna do me, all right?

I want to do you.
What?


Just, why are you
being so weird?

Just...
I kind of want to... I kind of want to go home.

Really?

Ok. Well, then let's go home.

Good morning.

So, what's up?
You, uh, busy today?

I have a meeting and I'm late.

I was thinking maybe
we could hang out later?

Chill if you're
not doing anything.

No, I'm... I'm going to be
really late.

It's a late one for me, but have a
great day and I'll see you later.

Ok? Smile. Have fun.

[somber music]

<i>â™ª Spinning on a one and one

Oh.
[chuckles] Sorry.

Such a rad camera.
Thank you. Yeah, I got it...

I got it on a... just, like, little...
Throwback.

Yeah, it's a throwback.
Where did you come from?

Um, L.A. I live in L.A.
But where?

Kind of Highland Park area?

<i>â™ª Could have been the same â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because a player plays â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You push my love away â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Today you try-try-try
try to break my heart â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª It didn't work 'cause it was
broken from the jump â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª But good try my love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Couldn't feel a way
because a player plays â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You try to cut
my feelings off â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For you I wouldn't stay
because a player plays â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because a player plays
my love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Couldn't feel the pain
no, no â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Feel a way, couldn't feel a
way, couldn't feel her love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Couldn't feel her â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Couldn't feel her anyway â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Way up
I couldn't feel a way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Because a player plays â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Push my love away.... â™ª</i>

[Ruby] <i>Hey.</i>
Hello?

I'll text you the details.</i>

<i>â™ª Everybody want
to be a superstar â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Flashing lights

<i>â™ª They really know
who they are â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Designer fashion

<i>â™ª One day

...big fucking dick.
[man 1] Bitcoin, baby.

I'm telling you. Buy Bitcoin.

[man 2] No, It's not... it's made up.
It's not going anywhere.

But all right,
so tell me where it's going.


[man 1] Ethereum, bitcoin. You tell me.
You're on that crazy shit.

You and Joey. But he did show me this
song, though, today.

It was pretty sick.
Let me show you.

I heard that.
Oh, you know?

Yeah, I heard it.
Yeah. All right.

[hip hop music on phone]

<i>â™ª My nigga â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª My nigga â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My nigga, hey! â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My nigga â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª My nigga â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey, it's my nigga â™ª</i>

The beat. The beat is hot.
<i>â™ª My nigga â™ª</i>

Hey! Hey!
<i>â™ª My nigga â™ª</i>

Ruby's looking mighty fine tonight.
Yeah. She is. Yeah.

Anyways,
how's the rest of that song go?

Hey, are you Ok?
Yeah.

Hey.
Hey, how are you doing?

Oh, you're so sweet. [giggles]

Hey, thank you so much for this gentleman right here.
Of course.

I loved his work. It's fantastic.
I'm gonna do everything I can

to get it out there.
Keep exploring, baby.

Come on, pound me.
Come on, dawg.

Yo bro, get the fuck out
my face, dawg.

Get the fuck out
my face, bro.

Ok.
[Francisco] Talk to you, Ruby.

What is your problem?

Hunter!
I did all of this for you.

You did?
Yes, I set this up for you.

Ok, cool.
These are the connections that you need to make

to be successful.

I'm not trying to be an artist.

Hunter, do you want
to be successful?

Enjoy your party, I'm going home.
Hunter?

Are you kidding me?
Get back here. Hunter!

You didn't have to come here.

[wind rumbling]

[train chugging]

Hunter.

What the fuck?

You just leave me like that?
Yep.

I don't get you.

I know you don't get me.

Yeah. And you know what, Hunter?

You don't get yourself.
You're lazy.

Do you think I'm trying
to tell you to sell out?

I'm just saying sell anything.

You think you're so high
and mighty.

Do you pay your bills?

Do you even...
do you even have bills?

I don't know.
You want to be successful

but you don't do the work
to be successful.

You want to be an artist but you
have no drive and no motivation.

It's... What are you doing here?

Why did you invite me
here, Ruby?

Oh, did I?
Yeah, you did.

[dramatic music]

Hey, stop following me, nigga.
You want to catch this flame, dawg?

Huh? You want to catch
this fucking flame, bro?

You want to catch this
fucking flame, bro? Let's go.

Oh, don't guilt trip me
Guilt trip you... Shut the fuck up.

Don't blame this on me.
Ok.

Fuck. Fuck! [echoes]

dawg. What the fuck? Square up.

Look, this is all a sign.
You came here. You're with me.

You broke your celibacy
and your sobriety.

You're gonna bring
that up right now?

You know what?
You're going to bring that up?

You don't know who you are.

So go figure that out,

preferably
not on my fucking couch.

I'm letting you fucking me up.

No. You just can't handle
hearing the truth.

The truth?

The truth is
you're vain as fuck, Ruby.

Your whole identity is a highlighted
and curated fucking timeline.

All right?

You're fucking narcissistic.
You're arrogant, you are self-entitled.

Don't fucking
come for me right now.

I don't care about what it looks like.
You don't care about what it is,

if the truth was standing
in front of your face right now,

you wouldn't know who it is?
Look at me. Look at me.


[dramatic music continues]

I can't do this.

I can't do this. I can't.

I can't do this with you, Ruby.

I can't.

[music fades]

[soft wind rustles]

[cicadas chirping]


Hi.

Yo.
How are you feeling?

It's going to be all right.

It's just time
to focus on you. That's all.

Yeah, Ok.
All right.

[relaxing music]

[woman narrator] <i>Hello, my loves
and welcome to the Venus experience.</i>

<i>In this guided meditation,
you are loved, you matter.</i>

Look what I got for you.
What's this?

Sold two of your paintings yesterday.
What?

Woo! Ain't you happy?
Oh, shit.

Mm-hmm.
Damn, that's great, I needed that. What? They liked them.

They did like them. There's this
new vibe you got going.

It's perfect. It's good.

What's wrong?

No, I ju...
I'm not mad about nothing.

I just feel like it's that I'm
just trying to get everything out.

All the bullshit.
All right.

All the issues and I'm just like...
The real?

The real,
and I'm leaning into that and...

Are you scared?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm scared.
It's your ego.

It's everything
is taking the whole...

It's taken a hit,
it's your transformation time.

But it's coming out right.
Right?

It's, uh...

...scary. Like, how the fuck
do you sell truth?

By being
your true authentic self.

This card I pulled,
this is your superhero.

You're going to be who you are.

You're gonna let the truth
be revealed and be incomparable.

You have to find your strength.

This is you.

When you're ready,

that fear, scared,

it's going to trigger
your superpower.

It has to be in you.
Submit to it. Give in.

What matters is the art.

How you're being truthful
to yourself in the art.

You have to give in.
That's how you saw the truth.

That's fine.

The shadow side shows you
what you need to know.

It's all a part of you.

There's a part of you that has been
hindered as a child that was held back.

You never gave yourself
permission to understand.

Or to feel.

Well now, through your art,
it's coming out. Be Ok with it.

Whether it's regarded
as good or bad.

It's all you.
It's all light, it's perfect.

It's who you're supposed to be.
Give in. Submit.

It's hard. I'm scared, you know?

That's why I'm looking at my life and
I'm like, "What am I sacrificing?" Right?

Yeah.
Like, am I sacrificing to be trending?

Am I sacrificing
to be rich, have money?

To not be happy, you know.

I'm just scared, Alo.

Of what?
Because I'm fucking 33.

I'm not married,
I don't have no kids.

I have no family.

[sighs]
Give into it.

It'll be Ok.
Yo, I shouldn't even be in this mind frame because...

No, you just got paid.

I just got paid for my art, right?
You just got paid.

All right. Yo, I'm gonna be over there and kick
it 'cause I need to get a, like, create a vibe

after this beautiful reading
you just did.

And, uh, I appreciate you.
Just read me, boy.

You read the kid.

Oh, fuck, Alo.
What do I do, honey?

All right. I'm out.
All right.

[mellow electronic music]

[background chattering]

Yo.

Hey.
[Hunter] Long time.

I'm so proud of you.
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

It looks so good.
I know. Thank you.

Thank you.
How are you feeling?

I'm good. It's all good. Yeah. It's crazy.
Yeah?

It's your time,
you pop that collar.

I feel good.

I love you guys.

Love you. Thank you.
All right.

Let's get started.
Do you thing. It's your time.

I'll go socialize and network, you know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm so proud of you.

I may not have the luck
with certain men

because to me
it's a valuable world.

This is much bigger than love and women...
Oh, Cleo, please.

I know. I know.
Thank you. I appreciate it.

All right.

Not today.

Not today. What's up?

Hi, um...

Oh, hey, what's up?
Hi, I'm Margie,

um, I have a gallery I recently
opened in downtown L.A.

How are you?
I was blown away by this.

I would love to set up a time
to talk about your next show.

Really? Oh, for sure. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

[mellow music]

[Hunter] Alo.
Yo.

Yo.
Hey.

Oh, hi. How are you doing?

Come here.
Thank you for coming.

Of course.
I feel so good. Thank you so much.

Thank you. This is... this is cute.
This is crazy, right?

I finally did it.
This is good, right?

Yes, this is amazing. Come here.
This is good.

Listen, young one...

...love never, ever makes a mistake
when you're focused on loving yourself.

You know that.
I know that.

All right, everybody.

Um...

...I'd like to say thank you
for coming out tonight.

Thank you for being here.

If you guys know me, you know
that this is a big deal for me

and I really appreciate you guys
coming out to support

this journey of art that I've
been kind of going through.

Uh...

...this is what I've been
working on and uh...

...I hope you enjoy.

<i>I create spaces for my truth.</i>

[upbeat hip hop music]

Congratulations.

You finally did it.
Thank you.

How you been?

I've been good.

Listen, I...

...I really appreciate
the time that we spent together.

And I think that you were honest
with me in a way that...

...no one ever has been before.

That means a lot.

You live and you grow, right?

Can we start over?

Let me reintroduce myself.

I'm Ruby.
