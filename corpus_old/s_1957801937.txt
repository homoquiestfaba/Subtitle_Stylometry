<i>Eve?</i>

Is it weird watching
a nuclear explosion

right after we've had sex?

That's just what life is now.

Yeah.

It could happen to us
any time, now.

<i>This is Brooklyn internet radio.</i>

<i>Rainy skies this morning</i>

<i>with possible clearing
this afternoon.</i>

<i>Next up is international news.</i>

<i>Because of escalating tension</i>

<i>between the United States and...</i>

<i>and between...</i>

<i>and the United States...</i>

<i>the United States Army
has been deployed.</i>

<i>Top story this morning,
the President announced</i>

<i>the roll out of his plan</i>

<i>which has been approved
by Congress.</i>

<i>Residents of major cities
are being asked to practice</i>

<i>their escape plans...</i>

<i>both have dramatically increased</i>

<i>their manufacture
of nuclear weapons.</i>

<i>Both countries are threatening
to use nuclear weapons...</i>

<i>The White House warns
it could come at any time,</i>

<i>nuclear, nuclear weapons,</i>

<i>the President urges citizens
to remain calm.</i>

<i>Local governments
have provided guidelines</i>

<i>on how many people
are to practice</i>

<i>their escape plans.</i>

<i>People will practice in turns...</i>

<i>practice escaping...</i>

<i>escape.</i>

So, this is Poughkeepsie.

It feels weird to be here.

Well, the government
suggested it.

Since when does the government
give good advice?

We're actually practicing
what to do

if a nuclear bomb goes off.

With what's going on
in the world,

it could happen any day.

We're practicing how to evacuate
out of New York City.

Well, so far, so good.

Hey, Mr. Pooch!

Mr. Pooch.

Well, this is Kevin
and Sue's weekend house.

It's nice of them
to leave us a gun.

So, there is life
outside New York.

You should know...

I'm pregnant.

Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

Just one sip. One sip.

You've already had some.

Hey! Hey!

Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

I put on our song.
I noticed.

It's cheesy,

but it's nice.

I want to have a child with you.

Now? With all this?

Don't be practical.

One of us has to be.

Love doesn't have to make sense.

Hey, buddy.

How's my little man?

I love you too, son.

Could you put your mom
on the line?

Hey, Beth. Are you both okay?

Beth?

Beth?

We lost the connection.

You don't look like a guy
who would pray.

You really believe in religion?

As much as I believe
in anything.

What were you praying for?

I was praying
that God's will be done.

Well, let's hope
<i>she</i> has good judgment...

Hmm.
And it's going to fix

this international crisis.

Do you think Chris likes me?

What?

I know it's crazy to worry

about whether
a six-year-old boy likes you.

Chris?

Chris!

<i>Charles!</i>
Chris!

It's a dream!

Chris is okay.

He was in front of me...

and he couldn't breathe.

And he died in front of me.

What if I can't save my own son?

How was your walk?

It was okay.

It's seven o'clock
in the morning.

So what?

We're on vacation.

Is that what this is?

You know, we're just lucky
that they're out of town

and we just have
to watch the dog.

I'll make us some breakfast.
I'm not hungry.

I'm worried about you.

If I want to drink any crap

first thing in the morning,
I'm gonna do it.

I'm not one of those boys
you used to date

who you couldn't trust.

I'm here and they're not.

I know you're worried
about Chris.

It sucks that Beth took him
to visit his grandparents now.

I called again, there are
no plane tickets to California.

All the airlines are grounded.

Maybe we should drive?

Which would take five days.

The news is clear.

Multiple nuclear missiles
might hit Los Angeles today...

Today.

Who are you angry at, Charles?

You don't even know
who you're angry at.

<i>This report just in...</i>

<i>The governor of Virginia
has been shot.</i>

<i>No news yet
on if she is still alive.</i>

<i>This just in
after a mass shooting</i>

<i>just outside Washington D.C.</i>

I never call myself an artist.

<i>I call myself a painter.</i>

But, whatever you call it,

it's a way of seeing the world.

Someone might focus on making
as much money as possible,

which is okay,

but my work is different.

It helps me process life.

So, today,
I paint a nuclear explosion.

<i>It's a rehearsal for what
may happen later today.</i>

<i>It's part of my series
about the End of Days,</i>

which I hope doesn't happen.

<i>But I imagine the unimaginable.</i>

I keep trying to call him.

The calls won't go through.

All the lines are jammed.

And your parents?

I'm just glad I spoke
to them last week.

The Russian troops
have marched into the city.

<i>"These are the words of Christ</i>

<i>and they teach us
how far we must imitate</i>

<i>his life and character.</i>

<i>If we seek illumination
from all blindness of heart,</i>

let it be our most
earnest study, therefore,

to dwell upon the life
of Jesus Christ."

So, um, you just try to be
as much like Jesus as you can.

Even though you know
you're going to mess up a lot.

Beth has it figured out,

a fancy apartment,
fancy job, a son.

I'm just a painter...
with a day job,

doing administrative work
four days a week.

Does it kill my soul?

No.

<i>You</i> actually make a living
writing your novels

about people
struggling to be moral

in an amoral world.

Well, I think my readers know...

that I'm a man
who knows about fear.

The fear of... of when you die,

nobody will give a shit.

That your life has no meaning

because you didn't earn
millions of dollars...

or set the world on fire.

You just had a life.

They didn't bomb
Los Angeles today.

So, I... I guess it's a good day.

Sorry that took so long.

I must have missed breakfast.

Eve?

The Russians
have taken over the city.

Tbilisi.

They've cut off
all the phone service

to the West.

My parents are liberal,
intellectuals, artists.

They'll be among the first
they'll imprison.

I don't know how to wait
for bombs to come.

Did you get food?

There's hardly any.

Did you get gas?

There's nothing.

We have to be
really careful where we drive.

What has happened to the world?

I'm just trying to live
my little life,

but how can I do that
when I don't know

if I'll ever see
my parents again?

And you don't know
if you will see your son.

Where is your God now, Charles?

Eve?

Eve!

Eve!

Eve!

Eve!

Eve?

I lost the baby.

Life can be over so quickly.

<i>More rioting broke out today</i>

<i>in Washington where protests
turned violent.</i>

<i>Up to two dozen
people were killed,</i>

<i>several hundred were wounded...</i>

<i>It's just been announced...</i>

<i>the mayor of Washington
has been shot.</i>

<i>People are
kneeling down and joining hands,</i>

<i>they're praying...</i>

Turn it off.

I wanna go to church.

<i>Attention!
This is an emergency alert.</i>

<i>This is an alert</i>

<i>of the Emergency
Broadcast System.</i>

<i>The Air Force has been deployed</i>

<i>over the State Capital
in Albany.</i>

<i>The Air Force has been deployed
over West Point.</i>

<i>The Air Force has been deployed
over the nuclear power plant</i>

<i>in Westchester.</i>

<i>The area
is at the highest alert.</i>

<i>Nuclear bombs
are expected to be dropped</i>

<i>throughout
the Hudson Valley region.</i>

It's hard to imagine
anything bad happening

in such a beautiful place.

The news reports
said that there will be

a massive attack
today or tomorrow.

Maybe it's better
to decide for ourselves

rather than wait for the
Russians to decide our fate.

Maybe we can make
a different choice.

<i>Outside Poughkeepsie,
a short drive away,</i>

<i>are the Catskill Mountains.</i>

<i>The Hudson River School
painted these mountains</i>

<i>in the 19th century.</i>

<i>It portraits
a Romantic landscape</i>

<i>where men and nature
coexist peacefully.</i>

<i>New Yorkers have come here
to escape the city</i>

<i>for many decades.</i>

<i>Maybe that's what
we're doing too.</i>

<i>The artists believed that beauty</i>

<i>was a manifestation of God.</i>

I have a dream.

What is it?

That we do this forever.

Where are you taking me?

Dancing.

We're still alive.

You haven't eaten
my breakfast yet.

Stay indoors!

Go into the cellar,
this is not a drill!

Listen to the radio for orders!

Go, go, go!

Come on!

What's wrong?

We lost power.

Where are you going?

To get more candles
and flashlights.

Charles!

Charles!

<i>Mommy? Mommy?</i>

<i>Go underground if you can.</i>

<i>Go to your basements,
bring food and water...</i>

<i>We've been informed
that you must cover all doors.</i>

<i>We've been informed...</i>

<i>We've been informed...</i>

<i>Cover all doors and windows
with heavy plastic.</i>

<i>You must remain there
for several hours to avoid</i>

<i>the worst of nuclear fallout
and radiation.</i>

<i>Radiation.</i>

<i>Radiation.</i>

Bring the light!

<i>The president is begging</i>

<i>the country to remain calm.</i>

<i>This is the time to remember</i>

<i>what's most important.</i>

<i>To hold our loved ones close,</i>

<i>tell your family you love them.</i>

Are you afraid to die?

No, but I've been
afraid to live.

Maybe we won't die.

I have to believe
that no matter what happens

in this insane world,
that it's God's will.

I wish I had your faith.

You can have it.

Isn't it too late?

<i>A nuclear bomb</i>

<i>has been dropped on West Point.</i>

<i>A nuclear bomb has been dropped</i>

<i>on the nuclear power plant
in Westchester.</i>

<i>A nuclear bomb has been dropped</i>

<i>on the State Capital on Albany.</i>

Eve?
