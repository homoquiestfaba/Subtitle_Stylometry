On December 31st, 2014 a taxi cab
traveled through San Fransisco.

From Chinatown to Merrill.

The car carried a
single passenger...

a woman.

Her birth name,
Adaline Bowman.

Current alias,
Jennifer Larson.

This is the first and last
chapter of her story.

Sorry just gotta be 5 minutes.
My dad's asleep, works nights.

Come on in.

I, ah, finished the color saps
in digital printing, last night.

I pulled some line art
from the Internet...

and printed the imperfections.

See thats kinda my secret...
the dust marks and discoloration,

no one else will have an impression
to detail in a million years.

So why 29?
I mean, if I were you, shear a coupla years off...

you could definitely
get away with it.

You are very kind, Tommy.

Nice work.

Was a pleasure doing
business with you.

And if any of your friends would need anything.
Why are you doing this?

Come again?

You are a smart kid,
forgery is a felony...

$250,000 fine,
six years in jail.

Shit, you...you're a cop?

No, I'm about as far from law
enforcement as you can get.

I just hate to see
wasted potential, Jeff.

Tony, it's Tony.
The autographed baseball's in your bedroom,

made out to Jeff. Don't get sloppy. 
It's the little things that'll trip you.

Honey, I'm home.

Reese?

Hi!

Come here, boy!

You are gonna love the new farmhouse.
Clean air, acres and acres of woods and mountain stream.

You'll feel like a puppy again!

Did you know, that your great great grandmother 
was born just a few towns over?

So was mine!
Not at the same time of course.

Oh...I gotta go to work.

Civic archives please.

Will take a while, mark is jammed.
Ok, then please take California to Hyde.

Theres construction on Hyde.
Why don't you stay on this,

take this to golf, golf to Bush,
bush to polk, polk to Grove...

and then just leave me
on the corner of market.

You want my job?

You never know.

Good morning, Jenny.

Morning.
Morning.

Hi Kenneth.
We thought you might not be coming in today,

being New Year's Eve and all.

Uh, its still a Wednesday.
The fun doesn't start till tonight, anyway.

Well, are you up for a little
excitement right now?

Sure, what is it?

Your favorite, the news reel archives.
Finally being digitalized.

We need a little help,
getting it ready to be shipped.

I love to.

Adaline Marie Bowman, was born at
12.01 AM, Jan 1st, 1908...

at Children's Hospital,
San Fransisco.

The only child Of
Faye and Milton Bowman

On June 16th, 1929, just as
Adaline Bowman and her mother, 

stopped to admire the expanse, where three
years hence construction would be finished,

on the Golden Gate bridge.

A young engineer,
displayed uncommon gallantry

87 days later, Adaline married
Clarence James Prescott...

at old St.Marys Cathedral
in San Fransisco.

Three years later, Adaline
gave birth to a baby girl.

They named her Flemming,
after Adaline's paternal grandmother.

On Feb 17th, 1937, eight workers and two engineers
lost their lives when a section of scaffolding,

fell through a safety net during
construction of the Golden Gate bridge.

Among the deceased was
Adaline's husband. 

Ten months after her
husband's death...

Adaline was driving north
to her parents beach cottage,

where 5 year old Flemming
was waiting up for her...

when something highly
unusual occurred.

Something almost magical.

Snow fell in
Senoma County, California!

The immersion in the frigid water,
caused Adaline's body go into an innoxic reflex,

instantly stopping her breathing,
then slowly her heartbeat.

Within 2 minutes, Adaline Bowman's core
temperature had dropped to 87 degrees.

Her heart stopped beating.

At 8:55, a bolt of lightning
struck the vehicle,

discharging half a billion
volts of electricity.

and producing 60,000
amperes of current.

Its effect was threefold...

First, the charge defibrillated
Adaline Bowman's heart.

Second, she was jolted
out of her annoxic state,

causing her to draw her
first breath in 2 minutes.

Third, based on Von Mymen's principle of
electron compression in deoxyribonucleic acid,

which will be discovered
in the year 2035.

Adaline Bowman will henceforth be
immune to the ravages of time.

She will never age, another day.

As the years passed, Adaline Bowman credited her
unchanging appearance to a combination of healthy diet...

exercise, heredity and good look.

Adaline?

Mariam, hello?

My God! You haven't changed a bit!

Oh! That's very kind of you to say.
Flemming? You're all grown up!

That's what I keep telling my mom.
She doesn't believe me.

Aw! I'm sorry, but we
really must leave...

You...you look like sisters!
You better stop or it'll go straight to my head.

How is that possible?
A new face cream from Paris.

Made from the royal jelly for the queen bee.
Ok, darling'. 

Bye bye now!
Great seeing you!

Action was required.
Just weeks later, when living a quite sub-urban existence...

Adaline was pulled over for
a minor traffic infraction,

Ma'am, it says you were born
on January 1st, 1908...

That's right.
That will make you, 45 years old?

Yes.
Ma'am, I'm gonna hold on to this.

And you can come by to the
station to pick it up?

Please bring your
birth certificate.

I'll be happy to officer.
Is tomorrow morning alright?

Sure.

Soon after, Adeline moved
back to San Fransisco,

and look a clerical job at
the School of Medicine.

There, she availed herself to every
opportunity to research her condition.

After a year of intense study, Adeline Bowman
was forced to confront the fact...

that was absolutely no scientific
explanation for her condition.

Are you a member of
the Communist party?

Or have you ever been a member
of the Communist party?

Adaline?

Oh! I'm sorry, you have
the wrong person.

From the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Miss Bowman.

Like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

Why? I...I haven't done nothing wrong!

I'm a good American!
How dare you bother me...

at the place of my employment?

Couldn't be helped, ma'am.

We have no record of your residence.
This way please.

Nothing to worry
about, Miss.Bowman.

Just gonna run a
few tests on you.

If anyone contacts you,
tell tell them that I...

went to Europe on vacation,
that I never came back.

The next time we see each other,
I will have a new identity.

I'll always be your mother.
You'll just have to introduce me as your friend.

Mama, no.

It has to be this way.
Here...

To ensure the freedom and safety
of self and her daughter...

Adaline vowed to keep moving,

changing her name, residence
and appearance every decade.

And never to speak a word,
of her fate to another living soul.

In 7 weeks when Jenifer Larson,
disappears forever...

and Susan Flietcher takes up residence in
a remote farmhouse in Ashton, Oregon...

Adaline Bowman, beside from one moment of weakness
will have kept her vow for the past 60 years.

Hello, Ray again?
Amanda, you're not gonna stand me up are you?

Yes, we did that last year.
Why you don't trust me?

I just can't believe you haven't got a better offer.
Impossible! I'll pick you up at 8:00?

Actually, that's the other reason I called.
The Grand Hotel of Knob hill is sending a car for me.

Look at you!
Have you ever been there for New Year's?

Only once, ages ago.
I guess it's pretty lavish.

Well I better get to it, then.
I'll see you soon, goodbye Ray.

You hungry?

No?

Oh! You just wanna come out
with me tonight, don't you?

Sorry buddy, it's a girl's night.

Avery if you don't remove your camera...
Both my hands are on the table!

Addison?

Thank you.

Happy New Year!
Oh! Hey Amanda, that was you clapping, wasn't it?

How did you guess?

You have good manners.
We are the last two!

Hey grab a glass!

Tell me, what did I miss?
Not much, just some happy chatter.

It's funny, no matter how old you get,
New Year's eve feels like the one night,

that anything's possible.
What's your resolution?

Same as always: True love.
How about you?

To live this year as
though it were my last.

You never know, it could be.
At our age, so hell ya. 

Let's live...

Beware of Bachelor, 3 'o clock.
Getting us stormed up!

Hmm, what's he like?
Brown hair, icy blues, smittens...

How come I'm with you,
I always get hit 'em with babies ?

Shh! He's here.
Good evening ladies.

Welcome to the Utahan! I know!
We don't look at the average 28.

You are too kind! What's your name?
Dale Davenport.

Dale's a painter.
Really?

A starving honest artist though, because he
doesn't accept his affluent family's help.

I...I'm sorry.
Have we met?

No, no, no.
Just your Cartier wristwatch...

one of the very first.

I'm assuming it was given to you
from a well to do grandfather.

Gr..Great grandfather.
But how do you that I paint?

Your hands are covered in paint.
That one was easy.

Well Picassa! 
Have a seat!

We're gonna buy you a drink.
Ah...sure.

Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

Thank you.

6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Happy New Year!

Hello?
Thank you sweetheart.

Oh! No, no, you don't
have to sing it...

No, please, please don't sing it.
I already had enough birthdays.

Aww! Where are you?

You didn't go out at all? 

Hmm, I don't blame you.

Are we still on for tomorrow?

Great, alright get some sleep.
I love you.

Good night.

Whoever he is, he has got
one hell of an excuse.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

It's just...isn't there some sort of tradition
if you are alone on New Years Eve...

that you're supposed
to kiss a stranger?

Damn! You heard that before.
Just once from a young king-cross bee...

...type.

Happy New Year.

I'm too old for this.
Oh no! Don't disappear.

I'll call you tomorrow.
Tell me everything I missed, I love you.

Bye dear!

Oh well! That'll teach me not to
my hand where it doesn't belong.

Something tells me it won't.
You know, that was a risky move.

What was? 
Not introducing yourself before you leave.

I'm a dare devil.

I'm Ellis, pleasure to meet you.

Like the island?
No man is.

I'm Jenny.
Like the poem?

No, not like the Sam...
* Say Iâ€™m weary, say Iâ€™m sad...*

* Say Iâ€™m growing old, but add, *
* Jenny kissâ€™d me. *

Who wrote that?
Poem one of the romantics I think...

Now you are not sure!
Actually I am, but I...

I dun wanna come across,
like a know it all!

Too bad, I adore
know-it-alls.

So...where you off to?

Some place with better food,
my apartment.

Yourself?

Back to the party.

I, ah, just wanted to spend
27 floors with you.

That was a risky move.
What?

Leaving your date upstairs. 
I hope it that was worth it.

What are you talking about?

Oh cmon! Beautiful woman in blue.
Does her name happen to end in 'kova'?

No! Her name is Agnus Bogs.

Her uncle is the chef.
I'll let him know, you liked his food.

And she's not my date.

Taxi, ma'am?
Yes please, thank you. 

Good night.

Oh! I'll just wait with you.
So you can find out where I live?

It does make it a lot
easier to send flowers.

Okay.

Thank you but
I'll manage.

Goodbye, its been an
adventure meeting you. 

Thank you.

Wait.
Oh!

There you go again!
Putting your hand in places it doesn't belong. 

How do we get in touch?

Happy New Year, Ellis.
Thank you so much.

Am I late?

No more than usual.

Happy Birthday, mama!

Thank you, darling'

I'm so happy to see you.

You know, you don't have
to still give me cards.

I love you.
I love you too.

So when are you
moving back up?

3rd week in February.
Right on schedule.

Of course!

I see, you already forgot about
our little talk on sodium?

No, I'm simply choosing to ignore.

Actually, um...

I'm thinking of moving myself.

But, you love where you live.
I do, but you know, theres just too many scares.

Last week, Kayle Fonso,
fell and she broke her hip.

The doctor said, she might
never leave the hospital.

And then, the very next day,
Molly Andrews called me...

and she told me about this wonderful
retirement community in Arizona.

She moved in last spring, she says,
she's never been happier in her whole life.

What's the matter?

I live abouts in Oregon's,
so that I can be close to you.

See you can come up
for long visits.

Move in, with me eventually.

We haven't lived together,
since I was in high school.

But...you're not
getting any younger.

What if you moved to Arizona
and something happened to you?

What if you got sick?

Then, I would hope, that you'd
come and take care of me.

What if I'm too late?
No, no! We cannot do this.

Not on your birthday.

It's a holiday!

Finally I fell off my feet!
What are you two cloaking about?

Major news, Mr.Jones is donating $50,000 worth
of 1st edition classics to this library!

What books do you know?

We're going to find out very soon because his office
called to say that he'll be here deliver them himself.  

Hi.
Oh no!

I'm Ellis.
Oh, good!

Welcome, Mr.Jones!

Thank you.

On behalf of the San Fransisco Heritage Society,
I would like to express our sincere gratitude, 

for your most generous gift.
I left my shipment in receiving but I'm sure they will be back.

If you don't mind, we would like a
photograph of you donating...the books.

Yeah. Yeah,
sure sure.

Can you give me one
second, though?

Hey?
It's me.

The know-it-all.
What are you doing here?

I got something for you too.

Some flowers.

Daisy Miller by Henry James,
Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury,

White Oleander, Janet Fitch

Very clever.

How did you know I work here?

I just tried the board.
I saw you coming out of our meeting.

Oh! You could have mentioned
that in the elevator.

If we had met in a
taller building...

I would have had
time to cover that.

I do not know about you but
I'm ready for some donating.

Perfect.
I'll be here.

No way, I would like you to accept
the books on behalf of the library.

Oh! No, no, no. I can't do that.
Yeah of course you can.

No, no, I don't want
my photo taken.

Don't worry.
You look stunning.

It's not about vanity.
I just don't like people taking my photograph.

Suit yourself, if you won't accept 'em,
I won't donate 'em.

You wouldn't do that.
I'll...I'll even have a book burning.

It's just...I don't like
my photos taken, Ellis.

Ok, fine. Fine.
Here's an alternative.

Let me take you out tomorrow.

Ok, that's impossible.

Alright. That's fine,
I'll just pack up the books then.

Where?

Some place you've never been.

Well if it's in this city,
then it's unlikely.

Try me.

You can leave the boots in
the front when you are done.

I'll be right outside.
We will, thank you Tom.

Alright.

Alright.
I give up.

In the first year of
the gold rush...

about 60,000 people came to
San Francisco by ship.

And a lot of them high trailers,
trailed to the hills...

leaving their boats behind.

Hundreds of boats
were left on shore.

Downtown San Francisco was
built right on top of them.

I didn't know that.

Now city services...

found this when they were
digging for utility line.

My God.

Isn't it something?

Is that...?
Yeah, that's a boat.

oh wow...

This is incredible!

So we had the digging stopped
immediately of course...

because we want this made
evident to the public.

We?

San Francisco Historical
Preservation Society.

Let me guess.
You are on the board.

Well yeah, they'll let anyone
on the board, these days.

How did you come by your fortune anyway?
By inheritance?

Luck.

I was a math major in college...

and in my spare time I developed
an algorithm for analyzing climate data.

But my room-mate figured out it could
also be used for economic forecast.

So we started a company
in the dorm room.

Sold it few years later and
with his half he retired to Fiji.

And with my half,
I...I'm doing this.

Your job is giving away money.

Yeah that right, but if you wanna make
a real difference in this world...

that's a lot harder than it seems.

What about you, Jenny?

I own a dog.

Okay.

I should be getting back.

But we're having lunch.

It's too late, Ellis.
I only got an hour.

Okay, um...

Let me at least
walk you back.

Thank you for all of this.
But you should know I'm moving.

Uh! Okay.

I have an idea.

I'll tell you a joke.
If you laugh...

You have to go out with me one
more time before you move away.

If you don't laugh, I will know we're
incompatible and gladly give up.

That must be one hell of a joke.
It's the funniest in human history.

But it's subtle, sophisticated...
so you probably won't get it.

Yeah, probably.

Do you like cap baseball?

Yeah, I love it.
Good.

One day at Fenway Park...

Ted Williams...
do you know who he was?

Hmm, the thumper.
Batting average 344, right?

What? Yeah.
That Ted Williams.

Anyway, he's hanging
around Fenway...

and this horse walks up and says:
"I wanna play for the Sox".

An actual horse!?
An actual horse.

So he says like, so what can you do?

And the horse says,
"I hit just like you, just a whole lot better".

He takes up a bat with his teeth
and Ted's like, "Okay".

He throws him a few
and sure enough...

into the bleachers.

So Ted is like Woo!

What else can you do?
And the horse says: "Well I can play short stalk"

So Ted hits him a few ground balls...

And sure enough.

He's a vacuum cleaner

Yeah! So Ted's like:
"Oh so you pitch?"

And the horse just looks at him and says:

"Pitch? Who ever heard a horse ever pitching"

Yeah!

Yes!

Ladies and gentlemen,
the lady has been conquered.

That's the worst joke I've
ever heard in my life.

Thank you.
It wasn't a compliment.

Dinner. Tuesday my place.
303-18 Street.

8 'o clock.

Fine.

Good morning, Miss Larson.
Good to see you again.

Good morning.
So what can we do for you today?

I want to add another
signee to my account.

May I ask the reason?
I will be traveling for a while.

Traveling?

Ok, I'll get the paperwork.
I'll be right back.

All these companies rate
very highly with us.

What this?
The Haloid Photographic Company?

They have been about 50 years.
They make photo paper and equipment.

They are developing something
called electro photography.

Could revolutionize the business.
But you won't see any immediate returns.

It could be a few years away.
That's alright.

I'd hate to see tied
your time and money.

I am patient.

What do you know?
They changed their names.

Now they called...

What the heck?
Start with "X"...

It is Greek.
It's pronounced: "Xerox".

Xerox?

So, we can start with
the signature card.

What is the name of the co-signer?
Susan Fleisher.

Susan F-l-e...

i-s-h-e-r.

Now, I made you some salmon.

This no eating nonsense just won't
do if you are a proper farm dog.

I want you to eat every bite.
Do you understand me?

Alright.

Here we go.

Hello?

Ellis?

Am I interrupting?
Hey!

I was afraid you got cold feet.
No, just trouble getting a cab.

Hey.
Hi.

Can I take your coat?

Okay.

Hmmm.
Your place it's, ah...

Unfinished?
Yes!

Ah, I noticed that part.
Is that an artistic choice?

No.

I have to paint, plaster and
do all the wiring stuff...

but I'm doing it all by myself.
So, it's gonna take a little while.

I think, your food is burning.

Just, eh, make yourself comfortable.

Sit down, relax.

Okay.

What is it...that you are cooking?

Well it's a delicacy that
is not for everyone.

Hope you like it.

Are you ready?
Would you like a drum roll?

Viola.

It was between this
and stuffed quail.

Please do not tell me
you're disappointed.

I...I'm truly overjoyed!
Yes!

Dig in.
Okay.

Well?
It's perfect, just the music is painful.

You don't like jazz?
No, I love Jazz. This is something else.

My mom grew up in Maine.
She's is a real New Englander.

Sweet but tough noucer.

My dad, on the other hand...

has his head in the stars.
Literally.

He's an astronomer.

Just retired from Stanford.

His claim to fame was that he
discovered an unusual comet.

Unusual, in what way?

Well it has a mathematically proven perigee.

So based on his calculation, it will
pass Earth in the winter of 1981.

Did it?
No.

No, it did not.

But that did not stop him from
looking for it every year.

It was a kind of ritual we had,
that was what was goin' on.

My dad is still looking.

Well one more glass of
wine and I'm hazy head.

Oh! No, no thank you.
Please.

Oh! Come on.
There was a saying in Italy...

Anni, Amori e bicchieri di vino,
run contano is mai.

"Years, lovers, wine cups..."

"years, lovers and glasses or wine...

these are things that are never kind"

You have no idea.

I like your view.

Thank you.

I like the way you read.

What?

The first time I saw you, coming out
of a board meeting, you were reading.

Your hair was pulled back and
you were wearing a blue dress.

It was a book in Braille.
I slowed down to watch.

How long did you watch for?

Long enough to realize
you weren't blind.

And I had to meet you.

And I did not know
when or how, but...

I knew I would.

I think I, ah...

I think I remember that day.

Yes, it was a book in Norwegian.

And because of all
the umlaut, the vocals...

it was really impossible
to comprehend.

You're kidding.
Yes.

Are you kidding?
Yes, yes of course.

It was braille for beginners.

Nursery rhymes or something.

You could tell me anything
you want and I'll believe it.

I know almost nothing about you.

It's better this way.

No, it's not.

Tell me something I can hold
on to and never let go?

Let go.

Hi.

Good morning.

Ok, move your arms.
Some of us have to work for a living.

Oh! Okay, I get it.
You are holding me hostage.

Will you ever come back?

You sure there's no one who speaks English,
or someone who speaks Spanish?

No, no.
(Speaking in Spanish)

I have to go.
Hold on, hold on.

Give me a second, okay?
Give me a second, I'm trying to deal this in Portuguese.

I can't.

What are you trying to say?

The rain forest trust fund
is to buy 5,000 acres.

Hmm, well you are not even close.
Here.

Thank you.

(Speaking in Portuguese)

I'm late for work.

Wait. That's it?
Let go.

It's a $1.50, Ma'am.

Ma'am?

I just changed my mind.
Please keep driving.

You got it.

Reese.

Reese?

Baby, are you okay?

Are you okay, baby?

His urine creatinine
is way too high.

Which means his
kidneys are failing.

In toxins in his body
can't handle it.

Is he in pain?

It's difficult to say.

If you were me,
what would you do?

I will be thinking about...

what a wonderful life he's had.

How lucky you are,
to have found each other.

May I have a moment
alone with him, please?

Of course.

Hey Jenny! This is Ellis.
I tried you coupla times.

Hope you got my messages.
Call me back.

Jenny!

What are you doing here?

I tried to call you, but...
How did you get my address?

Ahh, he library.

Come on, don't be upset.
I didn't know what else to do.

My dog, I had to...

I had to put him down.
Oh! I'm so sorry to hear that.

You should have waited
for me to contact you.

Umm, Jenny, I...
There's a reason I don't give out my address.

I'm sorry, honestly.
This isn't going to work, I'm moving.

Are you serious?

Hi, for you.

Barbara Ireland before
she moved to Florida...

she got rid of
all her books.

I couldn't get rid sooner
of this book if...

Well, seems I'm not the
only one getting nostalgic.

You've had such a wonderful life.

I would have liked to think so.

I just wished you had...

you know, she could have
been there for more of it.

So do I.

Remember that?

1954 was junior
year of college.

It's the last photo I have of you.

Well you seen one,
you seen 'em all.

It's true.

What is it?

What's wrong?

I'm just tired of running...

of lying to good people.

Then stop.

Nobody is chasing
you anymore.

Anyone who has ever been
suspicious is long dead.

You don't have to
be alone forever.

Don't you miss having
someone to love?

It's been such a long time.

It's not the same when
there's no future.

What are you talking about?
You got nothing but future!

I mean a future together,
growing old together.

Without that, love is...

it's just heartbreak.

It's the same for everybody.

How many times have
my heart been broken?

Too many.

If I had your looks and your energy,
I'd fallen tomorrow.

Really would.

I did meet someone.

What?

No, on New Year's Eve.
He jumped in my elevator.

Why didn't you tell me?
Because I knew you would look at me like that.

Don't get too excited.
I, ah...I told him to leave me alone.

I was horrible.
Cruel.

Tell him you're sorry.
Tell him you made a mistake.

I can't.
I'm leaving.

You're moving to Oregon,
not Timbuktu.

Come on.

If you won't do it for yourself,
do it for me.

Please?

Hello?
Can I help you?

I'm here to see Ellis Jones.
He's not expecting me.

Well let's see what
we can do about that.

And you are?

Incredibly sorry.

Mr.Jones, you got
a guest down here.

I bet you got a name.
Jennifer Larson.

Please, tell him understand
if he doesn't want to see me.

I'm here just to say I'm sorry...

and that my life has
been unbelievable...

since longer than he can imagine.

And I was emotional,
the other day....

And...

Now realize how incredible
kind to me, he's been...

and I was too stupid
to accept it.

But I know better now...

and...that why I wanted to tell
him how sincerely sorry I am.

Okay.
And...ask him if he can come downstairs maybe?

Let me make it up to him
by taking him out tonight.

Please.

Ah, Jennifer Larson.
She says she understands that you don't...

Oh, you heard that?
Ok, good.

He wants to know,
where are you taking him?

Some place he's never been before.

Hello.
Hey Jenny.

Come.

Oh! You don't really think,
this is my first chop shop do you?

Oh! Be quiet.
There's more here that meets the eye.

This used to be one of the popular
picture houses in the city.

Movie theater?
Yes.

In the 1930s, a woman named
Mary Elizabeth Woods...

read about a chemical magnate who
created a drive-in theater...

in Camden, New Jersey.

And, so naturally she wanted
one of her own in San Francisco.

Everyone thought she was crazy,
a loony, she was!

He used to sleep with anyone
who was her husband.

And she would put up heirs that
she was better than anyone else.

In fact...

anyway.

Because of local ordinances she
couldn't have an open air theater.

So she brought all
the car in here.

That's the screen,
right there!

It was spectacular...
I imagine.

Are you ready for the best part?
Sure.

Okay.
Look up.

She had illumine scent and
filaments installed.

They took the time to
create the constellations.

Isn't it beautiful?

Yeah.

What are you doing?

Come on.

Cheers.

The great paradox of
all this is that...

the better our instruments get...

that farther we can see...

but not into the future,
into the past.

The events that light
hasn't even reached us yet.

I don't think I'll ever understand
why few people care about history?

The future has its charm too.

We could talk about our ours.

Ellis...
Not the distant future.

Talking about this weekend.
What did you have in mind?

My parents are having a party to celebrate
their 40th wedding anniversary.

It's just a couple
of hours from here.

Come with me.

okay.

Can I drive?

Oh My God! You know you rarely
see a Saab in the Daytona 500.

There's a reason for that.

Equivocally, you might wanna
consider occasional...

tapping that square
metal by your foot.

I do not know what
you're talking about.

Oh my God!

Sorry!

What's wrong with you?

Do me a favor.
Stop to pick her up.

Uh! I rather not get stabbed!

That's my sister.

Sorry.

What's up pussycat?
Need a ride?

What does it look like?

How are you?
Well, hello.

Get out!
Still driving a Saab, huh?

Yeah good seeing you too!
Hey!

Kikki, this is Jenny.

Jenny, this is my sister.

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

You should have told us
you are taking the bus.

We picked you up at the station.

I stopped using telephones
two months ago.

Any particular reason?

To protest the involvement of
telecomm firms in the development...

of hi-tech weapon systems.

Kikki graduated from Berkeley.

So this is the new one, huh?

Have you done him yet?

Yes, ten minutes ago,
right where you are sitting.

So what's the story with this girl?
She works there?

I told everything Ellis told me.

Thank you.

Beautiful girl...

works in a public library.

Maybe she likes books and silence.

Or maybe she Google'd him...

and he found out about his generous
contributions that then...

worked her way in there and
she can get her hooks into him.

I bet that's it.

Shouldn't they be here by now?
You clear the table.

They are here!

Yeah, yeah.

How do I look?

Very pretty.

Oh! There you are...

Hey, Mom.

Aw Honey! You look great.
Look who we picked up on the way.

Hi.
Hey, baby.

So, this is Jenny.
Hello.

So nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

You must be exhausted after your trip.

No, it was nothing.
We did it in like 18 minutes.

No I'm not amused.
You know I hate it when you speed.

It wasn't, it was Jenny.
I swear, she thinks she has nine lives.

Let me take your coat.
Okay.

Where you been?
Forget where we live?

No.

Am, this is my dad, William.

Dad, this is...

Adaline.

Jenny, actually.

Dad, you okay?

I'm sorry, it's just...

you're exactly like this old
friend of mine that I...

Adaline Bowman.

That's my mother.

You joking?
Really?

Yes.
Oh my gosh!

Did you know her?

Yeah!
Yeah!

We were very close.

I, I knew her in London.

Yes, yes she lived
there in the 60s.

Right before she, ah...

moved to Paris and
met my father.

It is incredible.
What are the odds!

Wow, wow.

The resemblance is absolutely amazing.
Must hear it all the time.

For as long as I can remember.

Wow! We were very close.

You've said that already, honey.
I don't believe you've ever mentioned her.

Oh, yeah, I have.
No, no.

I remember your close close friends.
How she doin'?

He passed away.

Six years ago.

No. Really?

Oh! I'm so sorry.

An extraordinary woman.

Yeah, it runs in the family.

Come on, in. Want something to eat?
Yeah.

Yeah, I made cheesecake.

We're kinda tired actually.

I think we'll head up,
if that's ok with you?

Me too.
Really?

Alright.
I'll have you in the back bedroom.

Hi, you're in the back.

Hey.
Hey.

So nice to meet you.

Dad...
Oh, hey.

Hey, baby.

Miss.

Miss.

You keep doing that,
you gonna fudge your engine.

Thank you, thank you
for the useful tip.

Well you gonna get one
hell of a tan at least.

I'm sorry, I've done everything I
could to get this thing started.

Just...it won't.

Alright, all it needs is a push start.

Just loose the brake,
I'll give you a push.

Pop your clutch and
you can take off.

Okay.

Thank you.

Ready?
Ready, you ready?

Okay.
Okay.

Pin and pop your clutch.

Thank you!

You are welcome.

They would spend the next
five weeks together.

And Adaline did something that she
promised herself she would never do.

You know, you still haven't
told me your name?

Adaline Bowman.

But my friends tell me "Della".
That's beautiful.

Thank you.

Three weeks later his
semester completed...

William flew home to,
The United States.

Adaline, came with him.

Hey.

How'd you sleep?

Fine.
Good.

Sorry about last night, I'll never
embarrass you, its just...

Must be losing it.

It's ok.

Hey!
When did you come up?

Not too late, I read for a while.
Hmm...

Hi, baby.

Where's Jenny?
She'll be down in a sec.

She was up all night,
tossing and turning.

You have never told
us how you guys met.

We met in an elevator
on New Year's Eve.

You want some coffee?
No, thank you.

But I had seen her
once before that.

Hey.

Was at the library, she was reading
a book on Braille and I just...

I knew she wasn't original.

Here you go baby.
So was her mom.

How did you meet her mother?

It was outside London.

Her car broke down and
I helped her fix it.

So she was English?
Oh! No,no she was just there to study French.

Spoke like what, four languages?
I think so.

Wow.
Yeah...

Jenny is brilliant with languages too.
Really?

So old were you
when you met her?

Oh! I was about, Um...

say, I was in second year of 
Med School, I was like...

...26.

I was thinkin' of quitting medicine,
I was bored.

But I was...

I was afraid, I was too
old to start again.

I told...

I told Adaline about it
and she laughed at my face.

She said, "Go for it",
don't be silly.

Life is too short.

If not for her, I probably wouldn't
have found astronomy, physics.

She was only couple of years older,
but she was so wise.

And so...

so sophisticated.

She...

What? Honey!
That's enough, Williams!

What, what's wrong?

Oh! You think this is funny?

What do you mean? What did...
What did I do?

You were very close, very close.
You've said that twice.

You should see your face
when you talk about her.

Are you going to wax nostalgics
the whole goddamn weekend?

Look, it's just...

she looks so much like her mother and
then I'm remembering things that I...

not even I remembered.

Well I hate like feeling
of a second choice.

What do you mean?
Especially this weekend.

Second choice?
Yes.

Forty years, baby.
Come on...

Second choice?
No, no.

Honey, you're blowing this
all out of proportion.

Am I?

You are jealous?

Yeah, as a matter of fact.

Look, look...

It was fleeting,

inconsequential.

Sounded like it was
more than that.

I love you.

I love you too.
Come here.

I'm coming!

It's not the most romantic weekend.

Thanks for being
such a good sport.

Of course!
I promise I'll make it up to ya.

Sorry about my dad.
It's really embarrassing.

He's lovely.

Yeah, your mom must have
really meant something.

Yes she was.

Kikki!

So, guys...
I don't know...

Dad is running a
47 game winning streak.

All the money I spent
on your education...

I was hoping for
stronger competition.

Have you played this before?
No never.

Kikki, come on!
Do I have to?

Yeah!
Yes!

The idea is to get enough
of these little wedges...

Pie!
They're cheese.

They're wedges!
You gotta have enough of those in the circle to win.

Ok?

Most of the questions
are stupendous stuff!

Hence the word "Trivial".

Yeah! Like here's an example for you..
Umm...

"On June 22, 1938,
this American boxer...

retained his heavyweight championship...

when he beat Max Schmeling,
in the first round".

Well that is a tough one.
I know, what do you think?

Sony Liston?

Joe Louis.
Good guess though, really.

Yeah, women and boxing.
It's cute.

Excuse me?
Do you know, what that is?

You know what, fine ladies.
We are on this.

Here, roll the die.
Well here we go.

Alright, here we go.

Women are pink.

Women are pink?

"Who is the first United States
President to be born in a hospital."

Jimmy Carter.

Jimmy Carter.

It's fast.

Beginners luck.
I do not think so! Try again.

At what event did the 'hula hula hoop'
make its debut?

In 1956, at the World's Fair in
Schenectady, New York.

1956 World's Fair,
Schnecdady, New York.

Oh My God.

Nice one!
Wow.

Cheese.
Pie.

Wedge.

Alright, come on.
Let's do this.

What, too much pressure?
Do you smell something?

That your winning streak
going up in smoke?

We used to have this family joke.

What would happen first?
Dad loses intrevial pursuit...

or Della finally appears?

"Della"?

Yeah? You remember the comet I told you about,
that my dad discovered ?

He named it "Della C 1981".

After my great Aunt Adele.

Okay, let's go!
Yeah?

Come on dad.
Here we go.

Jenny.

For the win.,,

"Of what country was
Albert Einstein offered...

the presidency in 1952?"

Israel.

Israel.

It's okay.
We still love you.

How does it feel dad?
Are you sad?

I'm alright.

Let's look page two, alright?

Section three, paragraph H.

I'm sorry.
It's okay, it's time for my walk.

OK.

Yes, lets look at 10.

How many stars you think
there are in our galaxy?

I do not know.
Five hundred million.

Coupla 100 billion.

Plato believed that...

every soul has a companion star
that returns to after death.

If he lived a moral life.

You believe that?

No, no.
I'm a...

I am a scientist,
Plato was a philosopher.

Poet.

Why he you name the
Comet after my mother?

If my calculations were correct,
that turned out to be wrong...

it would have been the closest
approach to the earth.

Any comet, in...

200 years.

In other words...

like your mother...

a near miss.

What does that mean?

I was gonna propose her.

I had...

I had an engagement
ring in my pocket.

She stood me up.

Near miss.

Good night.

William.

She loved you too.

Wow.

Have we just met?
Right?

I know that.

Yeah, I should probably
shut up right now.

I'll just shut up.

Come on, what?

What is it?

I, I just can't tell you the truth.

I cannot imagine my life without you.

I know this is probably the last
that you wanna hear right now.

But I am falling in
love with you, Jenny.

I can not help it.

I do not know what to say.

I did not expect...

Please, don't say anything, alright?
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

Oh! Hello.

Jenny.

Do you know where
everyone went?

Yeah, Kathy, Kikki went to the
market and Ellis went for a run.

Okay.
Hold on! You have a bug in your hair.

It's ok.
What it is?

It's a ladybug.

They say they're good luck.

Did you get it?

I got it.
Thank you.

Please tell Ellis,
I went for a walk.

Della you ok?
Oh my God!

This will sting.
Ok.

Don't worry, I'll fix you.
Okay.

Oh! Oh!

Excuse me.
Hi.

Do you mind taking our photo?

Yeah.

It's ok, I don't.

It's going to be great, come on.
I do not like photos.

You will love it.
We're wasting film.

Of course not.
I'm just very shy.

Three, two, one...

I know.

I know who you are, Adaline.

What?

The scar.
It's the same scar.

I stitched it myself.

Please.

The truth.

William.

I thought I was losing my mind.

How? How is this possible?

I don't know.

I...I, I was normal.

And then one day...
I just stopped.

I wanted to tell you so badly.

But I couldn't.

You know what they do to me.
I...

I would have been a...
Curiosity?

A specimen.
Yes.

That's why you left me?

That's why you...disappeared?

You can't imagine how much it hurt.

I think, I...

I think I can.

You never told anyone?

No.

If I had, would have been Ellis.

Don't, don't run away.

Don't disappear again, please.
For Ellis.

Adaline...
Please.

All these years, you have
lived but never had a life.

Please, for yourself, for Ellis.

Stay, Adaline.

I don't know how.

Do not run away, Adaline.
Adaline!

Adaline!

Adaline don't, don't.
No. Adaline, please.

Please don't do this.

Adaline, don't.
Think about Ellis, please!

Adaline, please!
Adaline!

Ellis, I'm so sorry. I can't do this.
I can't explain. Jenny.

Dad! Dad!

Dad, where're your keys?

She's gone.

She's not coming back, son.

What just happened?
What, what is this?

Dad, what the hell did you say to her?
Nothing.

She can't explain.

Please tell me what she said.

She is not capable.

Of what?

Of change.

Do you love her?

Son?

Listen to me.
Do you love her?

Yes.

How do you know?

Dad, I don't...
It's a simple question.

How do you know?

Because nothing makes
sense about her.

Hello?

Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

Everything ok?
No, no...I just wanted to tell you...

What is it?

You're right.
No more running.

Mom?
I'll call you tomorrow, okay ?

I am so happy to hear that.
I love you.

I love you too.
Bye.

Bye, Mama.

The moon is responsible for
much of what takes place...

on the surface of the Earth.

A stray meteorite hit
the Moon in 1178.

The resulting concussion
would cause extreme tides...

on every lunar phase in
Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.

A 23% rise in the mean
tide of of this night...

produced a storm 2000 miles
off the Pacific Coast...

causing an increase in amount of
molecular ionization in the atmosphere.

And for the first time in 78 years...

snow fell in this part
of Sonoma County.

In the early stages
of hypothermia...

the body will try to generate
heat through shivering.

When this fails, it would
decrease the flow of blood...

in the extremities.

Metabolism slows
down to a crawl.

You are dying, but you don't know it.

In the final stages...

the victim only breathes
once or twice a minute.

A state of suspended animation .

Jenny!

At 10:07 PM...

Bowman Adaline's core temperature
had dropped to 87 degrees.

Her heart stopped beating.

At last...

to the age of 107 years...

Adaline Bowman was,
by any definition, dead.

Exactly precisely 10:09 PM...

paramedics placed put two defibrillator
paddles on Adaline Bowman's chest.

They counted the prescribed
five seconds...

before administering 
750 volts of electricity.

How is she?

We've just run a series of tests...

and don't see any
long term damage.

It's quite remarkable, in fact.

Is she awake?
Can I go see her?

She is exhausted but you
might get in for few words.

Okay, thank you.

Hi.

Jenny?

Hi.

Hey!

I know why you ran away.

You do?

That's because of what I said
to you last night, wasn't it?

I told you, I loved you.

And you got scared...
Come here, I love you.

I love you too.

There's something else.

What?
What is it?

Well, first...

My name isn't Jenny.

My God.
What happened?

Nothing, nothing.
An accident, I'm fine okay.

I'm better than fine.
Okay?

This is Ellis.
Hello.

Hello.
He's the man, I've been telling you about.

Nice to meet you.

I'm Jenny's grandmother.

What?
What is it?

He knows.

He knows!

Hey, everybody!
I don't wanna ruin the fun...

but I want to say something.
First of all thanks...

Kathy and I are really grateful
that they you are all here.

It means a lot to us...

that you would be with
us and help celebrate...

our first...

first 40 years of her marriage.

When I first met this lovely lady...

back in the olden days...

I had a pretty good idea,
what I wanted to do in my job...

but I didn't really...

know what I wanted to...

be as a man when I grew up,
If they ever grew up.

But the commitment that she made...

to our marriage and
to our family, to me...

The...quality of her love...

led me to understand...

that I have no greatest
ambition in life, than...

to be the best...

possible husband
I could be for her.

And I'm still working on it.

So here's to Kathy,
love of my life...

mate of my soul, mother
of my lovely children.

To Kathy.

One Year later

We are live, back in Times Square...

a few minutes from now
what have been waiting for.

The drop ball to 2014.

Here you go, honey.
Good girl.

Hey, you guys. You better hurry up,
you're gonna be late for the event.

I been ready for 10 minutes.
Oh! So handsome.

Thank you.

I ready too.

Wow.

I just need the zip.

Are you sure you don't
wanna come with us?

Hmm! I'm positive.

I got my date, right here.
Come here baby.

I love you.
Love you.

I'll to grab my clutch....
and my camera.

His whiskers are so big.
Yeah.

Adaline, you okay?

Yes.

Perfect.

The instant Adaline's
heart was struck...

by the defibrillator paddles.

The telemir structure in her
genes regained their pliability

Causing her to resume,
the natural course of aging.

William was right after all.

The comet "Della C 1981"
did finally return.

A half century late.

But as bright and magnificent
as he had predicted.
