<i>JE T'AIME.

YOU THINK
YOU CAN TREAT ME LIKE THIS

<i>THANK YOU.

I HAVE TO SAY
I LOVE THIS ROLE.

I'M EXCITED

I CAN DO IT
ANOTHER WAY FOR YOU.

LET'S TRY
THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER, OKAY?

UH, YOU CAN JUST
GIVE ME A COLD READING

AND MAYBE
A LITTLE LESS ACCENT.

SO WE TAKE THE FUCKING STAIRS.

I DON'T FUCKING BELIEVE IT.

DID ANYONE TRY
THE OTHER ELEVATOR?

THERE MUST BE
A POWER OUTAGE.

YEAH, BUT WHY ARE
THE LIGHTS STILL ON?

THOSE ARE
THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS.

WHAT IS
THE FUCKING EMERGENCY?

AND HOW SOON
WILL THIS BE OVER?

I NEED SOMETHING
IN MY STOMACH.

NO WAY.

HOLD THAT DOOR,
HOLD THAT DOOR!

HOLD THAT DOOR, HOLD THAT DOOR!
OH, SHIT.

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

A FUCKING DUNGEON.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

ARE YOU SURE
THE EXIT GATES ARE LOCKED?

AH!

HEY, ASSHOLE!
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

COME ON,
LET'S TRY TO LIFT IT.

WHO'S THAT?
HEY!

HELP!

HE WAS LOOKING RIGHT AT US.

MAYBE HE WENT FOR HELP.

WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

WE'RE...
WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE?

WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE A CLOWN?

BECAUSE HE IS
A FUCKING CLOWN.

THIS IS OFFICER MUNOZ.

DOES ANYBODY IN THE BUILDING
READ ME? COME IN.

I'M NOT EVEN GETTING STATIC.

HONEY,
LET'S JUST CALL 911, HUH?

NOBODY'S GETTING RECEPTION.

OH, THAT ALARM
IS GIVING ME A HEADACHE.

IT'S GIVING US ALL
A HEADACHE.

IS THAT YOUR CAR?

WHY IS THE TRUNK OPEN?

STOP!

HEY!
TURN AROUND, BITCH!

PUT YOUR GUN DOWN!
YOU PUT YOURS DOWN.

PUT IT DOWN AND LET GO OF HER!
PUT YOURS DOWN!

PUT IT DOWN AND LET
THE WOMAN GO! LET HER GO!

I'LL FUCKING PULL THE TRIGGER!
I'LL DO IT RIGHT HERE!

EVERYBODY JUST BACK AWAY.

NOBODY FUCKING MOVE!

JUST TAKE YOUR FINGER

SLOWLY OFF THE TRIGGER.

CAN YOU DO THAT, D?

BOOM. HER HEAD EXPLODES
LIKE A PUMPKIN.

YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

PLEASE,
I'VE GOT A LITTLE GIRL.

SHE'S GOT A LITTLE GIRL, D.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

I'M GETTING THE HELL
OUT OF HERE,

AND I'M TAKING THIS WOMAN
WITH ME.

OKAY,
EVERYBODY JUST MOVE BEHIND ME.

THIS MAN ESCAPED
A PRISON BUS LAST NIGHT

AND ELUDED A MANHUNT...
HE'S A VIOLENT KILLER.

I DIDN'T MURDER THAT WOMAN.
I'M INNOCENT.

SO PUT THE GUN DOWN,
AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT.

CAN YOU DO THAT, D?

DON'T YOU FUCKING
SMOOTH TALK ME.

HEY, MAN.
WHOA, WHOA.

THERE'S GOTTA
BE A WAY TO NEGOTIATE.

NOBODY'S TALKING TO YOU.

IT'S OKAY, I'M A LAWYER.
I DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

PLEASE,
JUST PUT YOUR GUNS DOWN.

THAT'S THE ONLY
SENSIBLE OPTION HERE.

THE ONLY SENSIBLE OPTION

WOULD BE TO LET ME JUST
WALK UP OUT OF HERE.

WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE, D.

NOW, I'LL LOWER MY GUN

IF YOU GO FIRST.

YOU PUT YOUR GUN
ON THE FLOOR.

I CAN'T GIVE UP MY GUN,
I'M SORRY.

WHO'S MAKING
THE FUCKING RULES?

HE'S GONNA KILL ME!
OKAY, OKAY.

I'LL PUT MY GUN ON THE GROUND
IF YOU LET THE WOMAN GO.

BUT I WANT YOU
TO DO THE SAME.

IS THAT A DEAL?

WELL, I HAVE TO SIT DOWN.

I'M... I'M... I'M REALLY...
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

FUCK.

THAT'S THE BEST
YOU'RE GONNA GET.

YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, MA'AM.

YOU SCARED ME TO DEATH.
I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.

I'M AN INNOCENT MAN,
WRONGLY ACCUSED.

I FUCKING BELIEVE HIM,
DON'T YOU?

WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE ALL HAVING A GOOD TIME.

NOW I WANT THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE!

WE'RE LOCKED IN HERE, D!

THERE'S BEEN A POWER OUTAGE,

AND THE DOORS ARE SEALED,
SO YOU CAN JUST COOL OFF, OKAY?

UH, EXCUSE ME?

YOUR FRIEND
IS BLEEDING REALLY BAD.

FUCK HIM.
HE AIN'T MY FRIEND.

THAT FOOL FOLLOWED ME
OUT THE HOLE.

HE'S GONNA DIE LIKE THAT.

YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
FUCKING SHOT HIM THEN.

IT'S A GUTSHOT.

NOTHING Y'ALL CAN DO BUT LET
THE MOTHERFUCKER DIE IN PEACE.

I'M GONNA TRY TO RADIO
FOR HELP, ALL RIGHT?

I'M GOING FOR MY RADIO...
STAY OFF THE FUCKING RADIO!

HEY, HEY, D, IS IT?

THE OFFICER'S RIGHT.
WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE.

NOW, THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO

IS WORK TOGETHER AND DISCUSS

A REASONABLE SOLUTION
TO THIS PROBLEM, OKAY?

I LOOK REASONABLE TO YOU,
MOTHERFUCKER?

HEY, I GOT NO DOG
IN THIS FIGHT.

THEN STOP FUCKING
LAWYERING ME!

ALL RIGHT.
YOU FIGURE IT OUT, COOL.

SOMEBODY HAS
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

CAN WE JUST PLEASE
TALK ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

YEAH, LET'S DISCUSS HOW YOU
LOCKED THE FUCKING DOOR ON US.

WE'RE DOWN HERE BECAUSE ALL
THE OTHER FLOORS WERE LOCKED.

YEAH.

HOW DID YOU
GET ONTO THE STAIRS?

WHY WERE YOU
IN THE STAIRWELL?

NOW THERE'S A GIRL
YOU DON'T MEET EVERY DAY.

VERY FUCKING HIGH CLASS.

SHUT UP.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A LAWYER.

SAME FUCKING DIFFERENCE.

NO, I NEVER SAID
I WAS A LAWYER,

AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT I DO ANYWAY?

ALL THE OTHER FLOORS
WERE LOCKED?

THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU, YEAH.

THAT'S GOOD THEN.

THAT MEANS THERE COULD BE OTHERS
ON THE STAIRS.

GETTING THEIR OWN
FUCKING BLOW JOBS.

HEY, OLD LADY'S
IN TROUBLE OVER THERE.

MA'AM?
MA'AM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

OH, MY GOD.

MA'AM? MA'AM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
MA'AM?

LET ME GET IN THERE.
LET ME GET IN THERE.

OKAY.

MA'AM.

LISTEN TO ME, LISTEN TO ME.

MA'AM.
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S DYING.

MA'AM, YOU SAID
YOU HAD A CONDITION.

CAN YOU INDICATE THAT?

MAYBE SHE'S HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

I'VE GOT AN AED IN MY CAR.

CHECK IN HER BAG IF SHE'S GOT
A PRESCRIPTION OR ANYTHING.

MAYBE SHE'S DIABETIC.

I GOT AN AUNTIE IN TALLAHASSEE
WHO'S A DIABETIC.

SHE COULD BE IN INSULIN SHOCK.
NO, YOU GOTTA GIVE HER SUGAR.

BLEEDING SUGAR.
JUST, LIKE, CANDY OR GUM

OR SOMETHING, ANYTHING.
HERE, SUGAR.

SHE'S TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING.
WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO?

UH, PUT IT ON HER TONGUE.

LET ME GET IN THERE.
OKAY.

HOLD HER HEAD.

MOVE ASIDE.

SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I DON'T EAT.

ARE YOU GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT NOW?

UH, THERE'S SOME CHEESE
AND CRACKERS

IN MY CAR FROM THE AIRLINE.

THE KEYS ARE IN MY PURSE.

HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT BLACK MAN?

I COULD HAVE JUST SHOT YOU
IN THE BACK.

THERE ARE COPS
OUT ON THE STREET, D.

HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET
RUNNING AROUND WITH A SHOTGUN?

I AIN'T JUST
DOING THIS FOR ME.

I'M WORKING
TO SPRING ALL Y'ALL.

WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP, D.

BUT YOU DO NEED
MY COOPERATION.

NOW WHAT DOES
THAT ALARM MEAN?

I THINK THE BUILDING
COULD BE ON FIRE.

WHAT?
GET AFTER IT, MAN.

CRANK UP THAT GATE.

WELL, BE MY GUEST,
BEVERLY HILLS.

ALL RIGHT, ONE OF YOU,
GO HELP HIM.

JESUS CHRIST.

COME ON.
GIVE ME A HAND.

I'M A CLOWN.
I BLOW UP BALLOONS.

NO, COME ON.
WE NEED YOUR HELP!

COME ON, I THINK
YOU WERE MAKING PROGRESS.

3FUCKING HELP.
WHY CAN'T HE JUST SLIDE UNDER?

YEAH,
YOU CAN FIT UNDER THERE.

DON'T NEED
Y'ALL'S FUCKING ADVICE.

MOVE, FUCK IT. JUST MOVE.

NOW YOU BE THINKING REAL HARD
ABOUT SHOOTING AN UNARMED MAN.

YOU PUT A GUN
TO A WOMAN'S HEAD,

AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO?

I LET THE FOREIGN CHICK GO,
DIDN'T I?

TELL THAT
TO THE FUCKING JUDGE.

LET'S GET THE FUCK OUT

INNOCENT MAN,
WRONGLY ACCUSED.

I THINK SO, BUT IT HURTS.

OH, GREAT, NOW WE'RE REALLY

I'LL FIND SOMEONE
TO GET YOU OUT.

FIND A POLICE OFFICER,

AND TELL THEM
MY NAME IS OFFICER MUNOZ.

AND CRACKERS?

OH, MY GOD.

A MAN IS DYING.

YOU'RE GONNA

AN EMT?
WHERE DO I FIND AN EMT?

HELP.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE
NEED HELP.

THERE IS AN OFFICER
TRAPPED IN A PARKING GARAGE

JUST OVER THERE
WITH A GROUP OF OTHER PEOPLE.

A POLICE OFFICER? IS HE HURT?
SHE'S... NO, SHE'S NOT HURT,

BUT SHE NEEDS YOUR ASSISTANCE.
THEY ALL NEED...

THERE ARE OFFICERS IN TROUBLE
HERE ON THE STREET.

OFFICERS DOWN.

CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

NOBODY KNOWS
HOW MANY ARE AFFECTED

OR HOW WIDESPREAD
THIS WHOLE MESS IS.

I NEED TO GET WORD

TO MY HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER
IN NEW YORK.

FORGET IT, LADY.
POWER'S OUT.

THE CITY'S IN GRIDLOCK.

YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM.

I'VE GOT CASH.
I CAN PAY YOU.

END OF THE WORLD,
FOR ALL I KNOW.

MERDE, MERDE, MERDE!

YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THAT?

I'M TRAINED,
AND I'M DEADLY.

'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT AN ACCIDENT.

HERE.

WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
OPEN IT.

THERE'S NO POWER
TO THE LOCKS.

KICK IT IN.

WELL, YOU GOT
REAL BALLS, BITCH.

YOU'D BETTER FUCKING
BELIEVE I DO.

OUT OF MY WAY.

MS. GENEREAU,
MS. GENEREAU.

OVER HERE.

HURRY UP.
THERE'S STILL ROOM.

THEY SAID THE AIRPORT IS OPEN

AND THAT FLIGHTS
ARE STILL LEAVING.

THEY SAID THAT? WHO SAID THAT?
THE BUS DRIVER.

HE THINKS HE CAN GET THERE
BY TAKING THE BACK ROADS.

COME ON,
HE'S GOT ONE SEAT OPEN.

COME ON.

HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

SIR, DO YOU HEAR ME?
YEAH, I FUCKING HEAR YOU.

IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

FUCKING PUT A BULLET
IN MY HEAD.

AND THEN PUT ONE
IN THAT FUCKER D'S.

WHAT THE FUCK

THIS IS ABSOLUTE MADNESS!

THEY'VE BEEN GONE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
THANK GOD.

GIRL'S THINKING ON HER FEET.
FIRST DRINK'S ON ME, DEAR.

THERE IT IS AGAIN.

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

YOU WANNA DIE DOWN HERE?

WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOU?

COME ON. SPIT IT OUT.

WHAT IS IT?

YOU DON'T WANNA LEAVE HERE.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

THERE IS NO POWER,
NO NOTHING.

SOMETHING TERRIBLE
IS HAPPENING.

THEN I HAVE TO GET OUT THERE.
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

THE POLICE
HAVE LOST ALL CONTROL.

OH, YOU CAN ALWAYS
COUNT ON A FIREMAN.

THAT'S NO FUCKING FIREMAN.

FIGURED Y'ALL
WOULD STILL BE HERE.

WHERE'D YOU GET THAT TRUCK?

IT'S A RESCUE VEHICLE,
AIN'T IT?

LOOK LIKE
Y'ALL NEED RESCUING.

NOW WE'RE GETTING SERIOUS.

HOW Y'ALL LIKE IT
BEHIND BARS?

THIS LOOKS
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.

YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD MYSELF THIS MORNING,

BUT HERE I FUCKING AM.

WHY DID YOU
COME BACK FOR US?

BEEN CALLED A MONSTER
MY WHOLE LIFE.

WHY DID YOU COME BACK?

I PROMISED THOSE PEOPLE.
YEAH?

THEN WE'RE BOTH
FUCKING STUPID.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

FUCKING OPEN THE DOOR.

SHIT, SHIT, SHIT.

YOU OKAY, DUDE?

GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY.

YOU OKAY? HERE YOU GO.
WHOA, ALL RIGHT.

STAY IN THE FUCKING CAR.

HEY, HEY!

AH, WORSE THAN
A FUCKING PLANE CRASH.

AT LEAST
YOU CRASH-LANDED IN BEL AIR.

THIS IS
WHERE THE OLD LADY LIVES?

I JUST HAD
THESE GATES FIXED.

GRACIELA,
CAN YOU OPEN THE GATE?

GRACIELA, I'M HOME, HONEY.

WHO'S GRACIELA?
IS THAT YOUR DAUGHTER?

SHE'S MY HOUSEKEEPER,
GRACIELA,

BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING ME.

SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

THE POWER'S OUT.

MAYBE WE COULD
JUST CLIMB OVER.

IF SHE HAD A BLEEDING BAR,
WE COULD.

I KNEW
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

WE SHOULD HAVE JUST GONE
TO THE STATION.

WHAT WE SHOULD
HAVE DONE IS GONE HOME,

BUT YOU SAW THE SITUATION
OUT THERE, RIGHT?

SHE SAYS
SHE HAS FOOD FOR US HERE.

DINING IN THE FUCKING DARK,
SO...

HEY, Y'ALL,
WE NEED A PLACE TO SLEEP.

OKAY, EVERYONE JUST STOP,

AND LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT.
JUST STOP?

YOU'RE AN OFFICER.
YOU HAVEN'T...

IS THAT THE BEST YOU GOT?
THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE WAY!

PFFT!

GRACIELA,

I'M HOME, DEAR.

WOW.

YOU LIVE HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

WITH GRACIELA,
WHEREVER SHE IS.

FUCKING DIED
AND WENT TO HEAVEN.

THIS HOUSE MUST
BE WORTH A FORTUNE.

IT'S WORTH 100 MILLION
IF IT'S WORTH A PENNY.

WHO MAKES $100 MILLION?

NOT ALL THE CLOWNS
IN THE WORLD.

EXCUSE ME.
I'D LIKE TO TRY THE TELEPHONE.

WELL, THERE'S ONE
IN THE KITCHEN.

HI, MOM.

GIVE ME A KISS
TO THE CAMERA.

MWAH.
OH!

SEAFOOD, LOOK AT THAT.
AND TO DADDY TOO?

A KISS.
LOOK AT DADDY. NO?

NO? JUST MOMMY.
YOU PREFER MOMMY, RIGHT?

SHY IN FRONT
OF THE CAMERA.

ANY LUCK WITH THE PHONE?

THERE WASN'T EVEN
A DIAL TONE.

HMM.

THIS FOOD'S GONNA SPOIL.

DO YOU KNOW
THERE IS NO WATER?

I THINK
THE SHIT HAS HIT THE FAN.

YOU'RE NOT SAYING
THIS IS SOME KIND

OF TERRORIST ATTACK
OR SOMETHING.

I WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE
THEIR HANDS ON THE HOT BUTTONS,

PEOPLE WHO WORK
AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS.

AND THEY ALL ASSURE ME IT'S NOT
A MATTER OF "IF," YOU KNOW,

BUT "WHEN."

* OUT CAME THE SUN
AND DRIED... *

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

ME NEITHER.
CAVIAR.

OH.

I'M GONNA FUCKING MARRY
THIS WOMAN.

GRACIELA?

GRACIELA? HONEY?

GRACIELA?

GRACIELA?

WHERE ARE YOU...

OH, THERE'S A STRANGE MAN
IN THE HOUSE!

IT'S OKAY,
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.

WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

WHAT DID YOU DO WITH GRACIELA?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH HER.

THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE?

NOTHING.
I CAME HERE WITH YOU?

IT'S ME, DAVID.

THE CLOWN.

YOU PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO KILL ME.

HOW MUCH
THAT FUCKING SET YOU BACK?

I JUST PAY
HER HEALTH INSURANCE.

YOU'RE FUCKING SHITTING ME,
RIGHT?

HER COBRA PLAN WAS,
LIKE, A GRAND A MONTH.

I FIGURE IT'S A WIN-WIN.

OBAMACARE COVER THAT?

IT BETTER,

OR SHE'S SHIT OUT OF LUCK.

I TELL YA, I GOT
A FUCKING COBRA PLAN FOR HER.

YA MIND IF I MIXED IN?

I WAS JUST GETTING OUT,
ACTUALLY.

AH, RIGHT.

THEN MAY I ASSIST YOU
WITH YOUR CAPE?

WE'RE REALLY NO DIFFERENT,
ARE WE,

THAN THIS HELPLESS LITTLE BEE?

WE GOT THE MILK
OF HUMAN KINDNESS.

YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
FRIGHTENED ABOUT ALL THIS.

ALLOW THE SHELTER
OF MY ARMS.

HOW WILL WE PAY
FOR OUR SINS?

AS PART OF THE HEALTH PLAN?

THE BOOK OF REVELATION?

HAVE YOU EVER READ IT?

I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER
REALLY READ IT?

YOU SPEAKING OF THE BIBLE?

MAYBE THAT
EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.

WHAT IT IS JOHN SAW

ABOUT THE SERPENT
AND WHO THE PROSTITUTE IS.

I PREFER "ESCORT"
OR "FILLE DE JOIE."

OR MOGGY FUCKING
SKANKY WHORE.

PUT DOWN THE SHOTGUN
AND EAT, D,

OR IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG NIGHT.

WHAT, ARE WE BEST FRIENDS NOW
OR SOMETHING?

HMM?

COP SHOOTS A NIGGA
EVERY 28 HOURS.

DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHAT DAY IT IS?

THE DATE...
IT'S WEDNESDAY THE 28TH.

BUT I WAS TOLD WE HAVEN'T HAD
COMMUNICATION FOR A WHOLE DAY.

WHY WOULD THEY
SAY SUCH A THING?

WELL, THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.
WHAT... WHAT IS REALLY WEIRD?

THE OLD LADY AND I
SHARE A BIRTHDAY, MARCH THE 7TH.

MARCH THE 7TH?
THAT'S... THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

GET OUT.
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY TOO.

WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

MY BIRTHDAY?
MARCH 7TH, WHY?

WHO IS HE? WHO ARE YOU?
HE'S THE FUCKING CLOWN.

HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S THE CLOWN?

WHO WEARS PANTS LIKE THAT?

WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY, CLOWN?

IT'S DAVID.
IT'S MARCH 7TH.

MARCH 7TH?
THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

MARCH 7TH IS MY BIRTHDAY.

MARCH 7TH
IS EVERYONE'S BIRTHDAY.

WHAT ARE YOU
POINTING THAT AT ME FOR?

WE'D LIKE TO KNOW
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

HE'S BEEN DRINKING.
HE'S DRUNK.

HE WAS DRUNK ON THE ELEVATOR.
SO?

IS THAT A FUCKING CRIME?

IT'S A MISDEMEANOR,
ACTUALLY.

NOT IN MY FUCKING COUNTRY,
IT AIN'T.

WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?
IN AMERICA?

I DON'T WORK A FUCKING CIRCUS.
I DO PRIVATE BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

SO DOES SHE,
I FUCKING BETCHA.

HEY, THERE'S NO NEED
TO INSULT HER, OKAY?

OR WHAT?
WANNA FUCKING FIGHT?

IT'S BEEN A LONG, STRANGE DAY.
TEMPERS ARE A LITTLE SHORT HERE.

AND WHY MUST EVERYTHING BE

"FUCK YOU, FUCK THIS,
FUCK THAT"?

IT'S A MANNER
OF FUCKING SPEAKING.

"IT'S A MANNER
OF FUCKING SPEAKING."

DO YOU EVEN HAVE ANY FRIENDS?

IN HIGH FUCKING PLACES,
YA TWINK.

HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
I'M GAY?

YOU'RE GAY
AS FUCKING CHRISTMAS.

YOU ARE JUST
A HATEFUL HUMAN BEING.

IT'S THEM FUCKING PARADES
I HATE.

YOU KNOW, HATE SPEECH
IN ITSELF IS A CRIME.

OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

FUCKING MURDERER
STANDING THERE,

YET I'M THE FUCKING CRIMINAL.

I'D WATCH YOURSELF THERE,
IRELAND.

YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW,

WHAT'S IT FUCKING LIKE
TO KILL SOMEONE?

YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

DON'T PRETEND YOU HAVEN'T

FUCKING THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
MADEMOISELLE.

I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT ONCE.

AW, I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT PLENTY.

I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

SO WHAT'S
THE FUCKING ANSWER?

I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUCKING ANSWER IS.

I'VE NEVER KILLED ANYBODY
MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE.

TWO FOUL MOUTHS
IN MY HOUSE.

WELL, THEN WHY'D
THEY PUT YOU IN PRISON?

'CAUSE I'M A BLACK MAN.

AND THE PRISON
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

NEEDS BLACK MEN
TO FEED YOUR SYSTEM.

THERE'S MORE NIGGAS
IN PRISON TODAY

THAN THERE WERE SLAVES
IN THE CIVIL WAR.

HOW LONG WERE YOU IN PRISON?

I'VE BEEN INCARCERATED
13 GODDAMN YEARS.

YOU EVER TAKE ONE
FOR THE HOME TEAM?

FUCK YOU,
MOTHERFUCKING SHAMROCK.

UP THE QUEEN'S BRIDAL PATH.

AREN'T YOU AFRAID
THAT HE'S GONNA SHOOT YOU?

OKAY, OKAY,
WE'RE GONNA SHUT THIS DOWN.

SAYS HE'S NEVER
KILLED ANYBODY.

I TAKE THE MAN
AT HIS FUCKING WORD.

OH, I DIDN'T SAY
I NEVER SHOT A MAN.

I'M OUT OF HERE.

THAT THE WAY
THEY DO IT IN PRISON?

YEAH.

FIGHT LIKE A FUCKING MAN,
