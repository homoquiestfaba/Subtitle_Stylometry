<i>MRS. RODRIGUEZ: After 20 years
of payment, Mr. Fender,</i>

this can't be!

Considering
the circumstances,

I think the death benefit
is more than generous.

But we only missed a couple
of payments toward the end!

You know, a lawyer could probably
get you a bigger settlement.

<i>But in the long run,
he's gonna cost you.</i>

<i>After the policyholder's
Paramed came back clean,</i>

<i>he signed up
for a Preferred Best Rate.</i>

<i>Essentially, this means we
lowered his monthly premiums,</i>

because he didn't drink,
and he didn't smoke.

<i>Now, if I can just draw
your attention</i>

to the highlighted
section right here.

But Hector, he quit the
smoking years ago.

Perhaps you would turn and
look at the screen behind you.

<i>FRANK:
As you can see,</i>

<i>the policyholder was not
exactly honest with you.</i>

You spied
on my husband?

You bastard!

I'm afraid that I'm gonna
have to take this check back.

But you can't!
You just gave it to me!


<i>FRANK: No,</i>

<i>maybe not.</i>

<i>Maybe if I told them</i>

that you had
already accepted it.

No. No!

LONG-HAIRED MAN:
Oh. Oh.

[SCREAMS OF AGONY]


[EXCITED VOICES]


Thanks.

All right, then.

Now,

I've originally guessed
that about half of you

<i>climbed aboard this bus
after the accident.</i>

<i>You all know that this
Huntsville community bus</i>

<i>is owned by the city.</i>

And you're thinking
that the city

might pay
out big bucks.

A nice juicy settlement if you
were to file a medical claim.

Well, I'm here
to tell you

that you're breaking
the law.

In the past, you could get
away with this for sure.

But what
you might not know,

is that behind that mirror
is a video camera.

<i>You all
have been videotaped.</i>

Now, I'm gonna sit
right here,

I'm gonna close
my eyes,

and I'm gonna
count to ten.

I strongly advise those of you who would
like to remain free citizens to leave

before I get
to the count of nine.

One,

two,

three,

four,

<i>five,</i>

<i>six</i>

<i>seven,</i>

<i>eight,</i>

nine,

ten.

Did you give them
the video speech?

The city ought to install
those things.

It'd make our jobs
a hell of a lot easier.

I've got a doozy
for you,

up in North Hastings.

Our contact down at
the Police Department,

he heard that a guy named Kelvin
Anderson died in the car accident.

There's a woman
named Isold,

his sole beneficiary,
Kelvin's sister.

Kelvin busted out of prison a few
years back, nobody's seen him since.

Until now.

Who the hell
insured a con man

with a million dollar
death benefit?

One of our bureaus
down south.

He did it before
he went to prison.

You want it, then?

North Hastings?

It's a couple hours.

Come on, the drive
will do you good.

Can't this wait
till Monday?

<i>Actually, Weaver called ahead, and the
local yokels are kinda expecting you.</i>

He's a big scam
artist, Abe.

Weaver wants you
to get on it right away.

A weekend
in Hastings.

You're the man, Abe.

Yeah, I'm the man with
no wife and no kids.

Geez, Frank.

<i>It's a lot of
money, Abe.</i>

<i>Make sure this
guy is really dead.</i>

And if he is dead,

dig up some dirt
on him.

About time
you got here.

<i>[MUSIC]</i>

Hello, fella!

Hi.

Name's William.
My son, Russle.

Hey.
Abe Holt.

Nice to
meet you.

How was
the drive?

Long.

WILLIAM: The car is registered
to one Kelvin Anderson.

RUSSLE: Which came
as quite a surprise.

ABE:
How's that?

At first, we thought
it was Fred's Malibu.

Fred?

Fred McBride.
He's married to Isold.

<i>ABE: They, uh, drive
the same car.</i>

WILLIAM: We ran the plates,
checked the VIN number,

it all checks out.

We also found Kelvin's driver's
license in the glove box.

Oh, yeah?

RUSSLE: Yeah. Poor sap.
Burned to a crisp.

<i>WILLIAM: He must
have been drunk.</i>

Let's hope so,
for his sake.

Great, we can nail him
for drunk driving.

That'll teach him
a lesson.

What's on
the other side?

WILLIAM:
His sister, Isold.

RUSSLE: I reckon he came
to hide out with her.

You fellas
know Kelvin?

No, they're not
from around here.

Oh.

What do you think?

You gonna have to pay
out on this one?

Yeah.
Looks like that.

How much
you reckon to lose?

A lot.

The death benefit's
worth a million dollars.

Death benefit.

Damn!
A million bucks?

Who gets
all that money?

Isold's the sole
beneficiary of this.

Shit! Fred's gonna
be drunk for a decade.

Yeah, it's like
you hit the jackpot.

It came at
a pretty high price.

She lost
her brother.

Some might say that.
Yeah.

Let's get the hell
out of here.

When are you gonna break
the news to the sister?

You're in a hell
of a rush.

How about we ID the body before
we start upsetting people?

<i>[MUSIC]</i>

[ENGINE STOPS]

[DOOR CREAKS OPEN]

[DOOR CREAKS OPEN]


Oh, geez!

No! Sorry!

<i>Can I talk to you?</i>

Oh, geez.

<i>Hello.</i>

Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

Well, you sure did.

Uh,

there's been
an accident.

An accident? No, no, it's
just that time of the month.

No, I mean by the tunnel,
there was a car wreck.

Was anybody hurt?

Were you expecting
anybody last night?

No. Why?

Oh, I, uh, I was just
trying to establish a time

and if you
were expecting--

No, I mean, why would I
be expecting somebody?

Are you a cop?

I'm Abe Holt,
nice to meet you.

Who was in the car?

We haven't IDed
the body yet.

My husband's asleep inside, do
you want me to wake him up?

No, no,
that's OK.

You sure?

Yeah, I'm sure,
I, uh,

are you
gonna be okay?

Yeah.

Okay.

It was nice
to meet you.

Jesus!

You scared me,
little fellow.

Where you going?

Me? I'm going
to town.

Can I come, too?

You? You want
a ride to town?

<i>FEMALE VOICE:
Thor! Breakfast!</i>

Your mom's calling.

How long does it take
to get to Heaven?

Do cats get to go?

You gotta go.
Here, go.

Jesus!

What's the verdict?

Death.

He was frozen
by fire.

For all I know, this could've
been the devil's grandmother.

What about
dental records?

You serious?

Are there
any broken bones?

He crashed into a tunnel.
He broke--

I mean, before.

Before what?

<i>Like when
he was younger.</i>

I'm not
his family doctor.

Can't you take
some X-rays?

With what?

Oh!


<i>ABE: What do you two know
about this, uh, Fred?</i>

Fred?
Why?

They moved here
a while ago.

<i>Why you so interested
in Fred?</i>

You heard
what the doctor said.

The body
could be anybody.

Body?

Okay, you're saying
it's not Kelvin.

Well, who do
you think it is?

Are you saying
it's Fred?

<i>How?</i>

It's Kelvin's car. We found
his driver's license.

Yeah. Exactly.

Wait...then how the hell did Fred
end up dead in Kelvin's car?

Kelvin.

Kelvin?

<i>Well, that means
Isold must be in on it?</i>

Somebody's got
to collect the money.

So where's Kelvin,
then?

That's downright crazy.

Is it?

<i>A broken arm can
bring in about $20,000.</i>

<i>A leg, well,</i>

it all depends
on where it's broken.

Above or below
the knee.

Nyah!


<i>ABE:
The big money...</i>

<i>well, that all comes
if you up and die.</i>

<i>[MUSIC]</i>

Can I help you?
Oh, hi.

<i>WILLIAM:
Hello, Isold.</i>

This is Abe Holt,
he's--

<i>I'm an investigator.</i>

Uh-huh, we met.

<i>I see you brought the whole
force with you this time.</i>

What did
I do now?

Hey, Isold.

<i>WILLIAM: There was an
accident in the tunnel.</i>

Is Fred around?

<i>[THOR WHIMPERS]
Isold.</i>

<i>Everything all right?</i>

Yeah, we had
a minor tragedy.

Our cat's missing.

<i>Well, is he around?</i>

Who?

Fred.

Hey, Dad!
Come here!

Yeah.

Hold it.

Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

I'm unarmed.

<i>FRED: This a raid?
What's going on?</i>

<i>RUSSLE:
Hey, Fred.</i>

Hey, man.

What the hell
was that?

<i>Got a new car?</i>

Taking it out
for a spin.

<i>ISOLD: Fred, the police here
wanted to ask you a question.</i>

<i>FRED: Well, all right.
Shoot.</i>

What happened?

Oh, yeah, I, uh, just got
silly drunk last night.

We better get going.

Don't you have
a Malibu?

Why, you want one?

Yeah.
Can I see it?

<i>Yeah. Sure.
Come on.</i>

She's a little love, but,
uh, here's your Malibu.

What's going on?

What really happened
to you last night?

Oh, nothing.

Just got drunk,
fell on my face.

<i>ISOLD:
Honey, what are you doing?</i>

Let's get you
cleaned up.

they slam the door in my
face and call their lawyer.

Investigator? Aren't you

Ever find out
who was in the car?

As a matter of fact, we
think it might be Kelvin.

Kelvin?

<i>Yeah.</i>

Your brother.

What was he doing
in Hastings?

You're sure
it was Kelvin?

You were expecting him?

Expecting him?

First place the cops
would look, huh?

Had to be kinda
stupid to hang out

No, no,
I'm not a cop.

See, I'm--I'm--I'm with the
State Assessment's office.

It seems we owe her
some money.

We overcharged her on some
property taxes years back

but it's tough, I haven't
been able to locate her.

That's 'cause she don't
live here no more.

You wouldn't happen to know
whereabouts she went, would you?

No.

Maybe you can tell me
where she used to live.

I'm sure I could track
her down that way.

How much money
did you say it was?

Oh, it's a lot.

It's--it's--it's a lot.

She used to live
on Route 12.

About 15 miles
past the junction.

You got

am I supposed to do now?

Just identify the body,

Hey, Thor!

Ahhh!

[BOTH CHUCKLE HAPPILY]

Swim like a fish!

Where's William and Russle?

Uh...they'll be along.

It's here.

[ISOLD GASPS]

That could be anybody.

It could...couldn't it?

He didn't die
on impact.

Do you know what it's
like to burn to death?

First the fat oozes
out of you.

It starts poppin' and bubblin'
like a hot dog on a barbecue.

Then your eyes--
they crack...like glass.

Your skin burns off
layer by layer until...

the fire hits bone.

And that's
not the worst of it.

It's the smell.

Your hair singes...

but you can't reach
for your head

'cause your hands
are gone.

Imagine what it's like
to smell yourself die.

What's going on
in here?

Nothing.

I--I--I was just--

bringing her by
to ID the body.

That's our job,
son.

Well, who is he,
then?

It's him.

I guess things are gonna be
different now, aren't they?

Why?
What do you mean?

The money.

What money?

The million dollars, Kelvin's
life insurance policy.

As you probably know, you're
the sole beneficiary to that.

Who's that?

Ta, ta, ta...

<i>FRED:
Thor!</i>

<i>Let's go, buddy.</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

Come on.

Let's go.

Let's go, Isold,
I gotcha.

<i>FRED: Come on. Get in the back.</i>

<i>[PHONE RINGS]</i>


Come on!
Answer the goddamn phone!

I'm sure they're okay.
The line's probably down.

<i>[PHONE RINGS]</i>

<i>[PHONE RINGING]</i>

<i>[SLOW MUSIC]</i>

ISOLD: You never notice your
mistakes when you're making them.

Then it all catches up to you
when a kid comes along.

<i>ABE: I wouldn't know about that.</i>

You don't have kids?

No. I haven't had
that kind of luck.

Luck.

Yeah, I guess
you could call it that.

Thor asked me
the other day,

"Why is God in Heaven and
the Devil in the ground?

Heaven's so far away."

What'd you say?

I told him it's easier to
lie down than it is to fly.

Don't be embarrassed.

I'm not.

I'm ashamed
of how I got him.

<i>[MUSIC]</i>


ISOLD:
Kelvin!


Kelvin!

where are you?!

Thor!

Thor!

<i>MALE ANNOUNCER: What would
happen to your loved ones</i>

<i>if you died?</i>

<i>Would they be protected?</i>

[PHONE RINGING]

<i>[PHONE RINGS]</i>

[PHONE RINGS]


<i>[RINGING]</i>

Hello?

Kelvin, is that you?

Where's Thor?

Thor's fine.

<i>Jesus Christ, Kelvin, what
the fuck are you doing?</i>

Calm down, Isold.

Don't tell me
to calm down!

You went too far.

It was an accident, okay?

You killed somebody.

And you're a millionaire,
motherfucker!

You're sole beneficiary.

<i>Just go and get the money</i>

<i>and Thor and I will be
waiting for you, okay?</i>

Will you let me talk to him?

It's for you.

THOR:
Hi.

It's me, sweetie.

I'm eating
a milkshake.

For breakfast?

You're a naughty boy.

See?
Everything's fine.

Now, listen, they have
14 days to pay you

once you file the death
certificate, so I suggest--

<i>I can't believe
you went this far!</i>

Listen, listen,
go and play your part.

Don't say that,
this is murder!

Just dumb luck.

<i>What the fuck
are you talking about?!</i>

Who's body is
down at the morgue?!

Just some drifter I
ran into at Josie's.

<i>Just one last con,
Isold.</i>

<i>Just one last con.</i>

<i>[MUSIC]</i>

This is gonna
kill us, Kelvin.

[CAR HONKS HORN]

[TIRES SCREECHING]

[SCREAMS WITH PAIN]

Nyah!


[LOUD DRIPPING]

I'm here to see Abe Holt.

Please.
Come in.

Right. Isold.

<i>All right, then, you're here
to collect the death benefit.</i>

Yeah.

I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

There was a no-fault
clause in the policy.

What?

What's going on here?

May I draw your attention
to the highlighted section.

As you can see,
it clearly states

that the death
must be a no-fault death.

"No-fault"?

An accident, like
if the policy holder

was run over by a car.

What, like crashing into
a tunnel isn't enough?

That depends.

Depends?

That was--that was--
that was--

before--before we got
the blood tests back.

It seems that, um...

the policy holder...

<i>was driving under the
influence of alcohol.</i>

A DUI.

He was drunk?

Well, blood tests
don't lie.

I know...

it's difficult.

Fifteen hundred dollars?

That's the bluebook
on the Malibu.

I'm afraid that's the best
I can do for you.

I need that money.

I'm sorry... Isold.

We're just--just--just

trying to run a business here.
You know?

Yeah, I wonder what my
lawyer's gonna say about this.

Would you like
to use my phone?

To call your lawyer?

Thor.
He's--

He's--

Kelvin's son.

I know that.

I need you to sign this document
in order to take the check.

<i>FRANK: Blood test on
a charcoaled corpse.</i>

<i>That was brilliant.</i>

The house always
wins, right, Abe?

Isold!

Wait!

What's all this crap about blood tests!
The body was fried!

I just saved you there.

Insurance fraud
is one thing.

Accessory to murder,
that's another.

I haven't reported that Kelvin's
alive, but there is no money.

He's got Thor!

He took Thor?

I need that money!

<i>ABE: Get me Mike Connor over
at Central Savings and Loan.</i>

Mike...it's Abe Holt,
over at Quality Life.

I need you to put a hold on a
check for me 'till tomorrow.

Check number QLI 3245.

<i>MIKE:
Okay, I got it.</i>


Just a minute,
please.

Is there a problem?

I'm sorry, there has been a
hold placed on this check.

<i>You'll just have
to come back tomorrow.</i>

<i>TELLER:
14, 20, 40, 60, 80...</i>

fifteen hundred dollars.

And I need to open
up a safety deposit box.

Come on.
Let's get out of here, yeah?

Come on.

<i>OK honey,
let's get your clothes on.</i>

What the fuck?
What is this?

It's the bluebook
on the Malibu.

Where the fuck
is the rest of it?

Central Savings and Loan.
Go and get it yourself.

Oh.

Come on.

We're gonna go home,
sweetie, okay? Yeah.

Where are you
taking my son?

Your son? You mean
Kelvin's son, don't you?

<i>I'm Kelvin's sister,
I'm next of kin.</i>

What are you
talking about?

You're dead, remember?

Thor belongs
to me now.

Wait, wait!


<i>Wait, wait, wait!</i>

Is that why you went
through it all?

<i>Changing my ID,
marriage...</i>

No, that was to get
the cops off your back.

Anyway, it was
your stupid idea.

Your forged
the marriage papers.

Do you think
I'm stupid?

Do you?

No!

I hope
you're not bluffing.

Wait, wait, wait!

<i>Please don't take Thor
away from me!</i>

Come on,
little man.

Say goodbye!

THOR:
No, Daddy!

Okay, get inside.

ISOLD:
Wait!

ABE:
Let the boy go.

<i>KELVIN:
Fuck!</i>

You went too far.

Taking a boy
from his mother.

His mother?

No, that bitch ran away
years ago, man.

Didn't she?

Isold's not his mother.

She's my fucking sister,
all right?

She's just looking
after him.

I know that. But she's
still the mother.

Let your son go.

Let him go, Kelvin.

Get out of the car,
kid, come on.

Go on.

<i>ABE: Nice and easy,
nice and easy.</i>

<i>I want you to get out of
the car so we can talk.</i>

Nice and easy.

Don't shoot.

Don't shoot.

Stop the car.

ABE:
Stop the car now.

You shoot me, we both
go down, all right?

But you let me go...

I'll split the money with you.
A million dollars.

There is no money. I switched
the insurance policies.

What do you mean?

I insured
Frederick McBride.

You can't insure
a dead man.

You brought him
back to life.

<i>William and Russle will ID your
body as Frederick McBride.</i>

For them,
Kelvin's dead.

<i>So if I shoot, Isold collects a
million dollars over a dead husband.</i>

Or give yourself up, and
as far as I'm concerned,

that poor sap is Fred McBride--

I got you, you and Isold
are millionaires?

The House has to pay out
every once in a while,

otherwise people
will stop gambling.

Well, it looks like
I'm pretty fucked!

Stop! Stop!
Stop the car!

<i>FRANK:
it's tragic.</i>

<i>One of our own involved
in your husband's death.</i>

I don't get it.

Well,

as usual, we did
a background search.

He came up
absolutely clean.

Not even
a parking ticket.

It seems Frederick
McBride was a saint.

You can't imagine.

One million dollars.

<i>This will settle things
as we agreed.</i>

<i>THOR:
Where's Daddy?</i>

Shhh.
Go to sleep, buddy.

I can't.

Want me to sing
to you?

Okay.
