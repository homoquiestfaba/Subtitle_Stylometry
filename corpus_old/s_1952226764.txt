[air whooshing]

<i>Dos passos.</i>

Wow, um...

No, I'm incredibly
flattered, obviously.

I just...

I would never have made
that comparison.

Although, I guess
I can see what you're saying,

'cause I mean, I did, obviously,
internalize a lot of that stuff.

The book is very...
it's classical.

But I mean,
it's also experimental.

It's a very strange novel.

I wasn't setting out to write
like any of the great writers.

But I did want
to distinguish myself

from the, you know,
the Franzens and the...

Lethams and the Eggerses
and the Fosters, Wallace.

I mean, look, I'm not
talking shit about those guys.

They're... I suppose
they're very good.

I don't read them,

but I sort of feel like...

Well, I sort of feel like
the novel, my novel,

is very complicated.

No, totally.

Oh, you're right.

Yeah, that's a lot of messages.

Not one phone call?

Well, you should just...
I mean, I don't care.

Fire her.

I mean, that's... accountants
are accountants, you know?

Like, you can...
I don't know.

I just... I don't even...

I don't even want to...

I don't care.

I don't want to...
I don't want to know.

I mean, I don't mean to be
cold or anything, but...

Yeah.

Yes.

Yeah, it's actually been
an amazing morning, yeah.

I mean, I've gotten
a lot of work done.

I think that I'm... you know,
I don't want to jinx anything,

but I think I'm sort of...

you know,
I think I'm getting there.

Yeah, I think...
I mean...

Look, we'll hit the deadline
or we won't.

I mean, it's like, you've said
that a hundred times, so...

Yeah.


Um, yes, I'm calling
for a Mr. Fuckface.


What's up, man?

I'm good.
I'm good.

How are you?

That's...
yeah, it has.

It's been a long time.

Dude...

I'm just...
hey, how are you?

I'm really... I don't know
how to answer that question.

Um, so no,
I just need to tell you...

like, I don't know, like...

apropos of nothing,

I was in a closet today,
and I found...

do you remember that old
tweed jacket I used to wear

for every second
of every day?

So I found that jacket,
and I pulled it out,

and there was a clinking
in the pockets.

And I reached in the pockets,

and there were these
six little airplane bottles

of potato vodka
that you gave to me

right before
my first book tour.

And I just...
I never drank them.

I wanted to save them
for a special occasion.

Anyway, what are you...

what are you doing tonight?

I just think
we need to hang out.

Like, it's been...
it's been...

well, let me just ask you,
like, have you eaten?

I'm fucking starving to death,
literally.

Yeah, I just...

Are you... you still work
in the same place, right?

'Cause I was thinking you could
drive maybe by Taste of India

and grab some Indian food
and bring it over.

I just feel like Indian food.

I haven't eaten anything today,
except, like, I took a...

I had a weird, like,
a bizarre brie incident

that I will describe to you
in detail.

But, yeah, like, so can you
go by Taste of India and...

Perfect.

I always get
the chicken tikka masala.

Yeah, and, like,
the saag paneer is really good.

And I like
the mulligatawny soup.

And make sure they...

I mean, make sure
there's chicken in it,

just 'cause the other...

yeah, it's daal,
I think it's called.

Anyway, it's really,
really good.

And then just get
whatever you want

and, you know,
some naan or whatever.

And I'll... it's totally my treat.

I just
can't wait to see you.

And we will crack
the potato vodka bottles

and sort of
make a night of it.

All right, cool.

Well, I can't wait to see you,
and I'll see you very soon.

Okay, bye.

Dude.

Hey.
Hey.

Welcome.
Thanks.

Um, I ate the couch
'cause I was starving, so...

But we can have this too.

I...

I think
you're a terrible friend.

[laughs]

I know.

I think you're...

You're an asshole.

You've always been...

You've always been
a total asshole

and a really terrible friend.

Um...

I, uh...

It's just sort of about this
sense that a lot of people get,

a lot of people my age get,

who are sort of
in their early, mid-30s

of sort of going through life
performing a role, you know,

that you're sort of...

that you're just sort of...

you know, you're trying
to seem like something.

And I don't know...

It's hard to describe, I guess,

but that's more or less
what it's about.

And it's very personal.

It has a lot to do
with where I've been

in the last...

So you're proud of it?
You're really...

Yes, I'm very proud of it.

I'm glad it's out there.

I mean, I don't expect it
to ever be as popular

as the first book,
but I kind of...

I think this is my...
this book is sort of

my attempt to make peace
with that

and to say
that it's okay with me.

And I mean,
I guess along the same lines,

I mean, this being
your second novel,

I mean, what was the...

Third novel.

There was another.
There was a second.

This is the third...

<i>Dumb Show</i> is the third novel.

The second novel
was <i>Hoarse Salute.</i>

Actually, here, it's...

That's my copy for the reading,
but I'll get you a copy of it.

You know, I was so...

we got so much attention
for that first novel

and for the,
you know, the movie,

though the movie
never came out

and all the other sort of deals
that came along with it.

I really wanted
to write something experimental

and really try and do something

new and different
and be shocking,

if that's what it took,
you know?

And what I discovered

was that nobody
really was interested

in that gesture.

And so there is a huge stack
of those books in my house...

Oh, no.

I think it's good,

but then again,
I don't know.

Anyway, I'll get you one.

Oh, please.
No, please, yeah.

I mean, if it's not out there,
definitely.

That's great.

Yay, well, I don't want to
take up too much of your time.

I have nothing else to do.

Oh, that's got to be a joke.

No, I wish it were a joke,

but there's nothing else
for me to do.

Got to rehearse
for the...

for the lecture,
I'm sure.

Can I, um,
off the record,

do you have a girlfriend?

Um, no, I don't.

That's very encouraging of you
to have asked that, though.

Thank you.

The idea to have a girlfriend
is pretty... it's refreshing.

Hadn't thought
about that for a while.

Well, if they smell your hair,
they might want to...

That's right,
'cause Aveda products, yeah.

Although, today it'll probably
smell just like sort of,

you know, motel...

Generic shampoo.
Motel shampoo.

The title is "Shampoo."

Yes.
Yeah, yeah.

Wow, um, well, I don't want to,
you know, bore you

with any more silly questions.

Please,
it's not boring at all.

It's really...
it's very... it's refreshing.

Well, I'm so thrilled
to come to your lecture.

If there's ever a huge fan,
that is I.

I am your biggest fan.

I mean, I'll be there tonight
with, you know, a sign...

Oh, excellent.

A big copy
of your book cover, yeah.

Is it gonna say, like,
"John 3:15" or whatever?

Yeah, definitely,
Bible verses, all the way.

Yeah, well...

The Bible of novels.

Yes.

I'll be dressed
as Mary Magdalene, so...

Oh, good.

I'm sure you'll be easy to spot,
although kids today...

Yeah, well, yeah.

They say they see me in chips,
you know?

[laughs]

Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

My pleasure.
Thank you.

Thanks for your interest.

Oh, of course.
Any time.

Yeah.

And off the record,
I'd date you.

Aw.

Okay, yeah, I would, yeah.

Yeah, make sure
that's off the record.

Don't want that
getting around.

Well, yay, well,
thank you so much for your time.

Yeah, thank you.

Can I get a hug from you,

'cause I feel like
I kind of know you.

Yeah, yeah, okay.

Thanks.

Yay.

Well, thank you.

Thank you.
Oh.

You're a good hugger.

Um, thank you.

Wait, wait,
before I go,

can I get this copy signed?

Yeah, yeah.

My boyfriend's
a huge fan and...

Your... oh, really?

Yeah, he, yeah,
loves your work.

I think
if he doesn't have to work,

he'll come
to the lecture too.

We'll both be, "Whoo!"

Aw, awesome.

Like a pro.

Thank you so much.
Oh, thank you very much.

Thank you.

Um, see you tonight?

Yeah, all right.
Thank you.

Thank you.
All right.

Bye.
Bye.

[pencil scratching]

Boyfriend.

[somber instrumental music]

# #

[bell dings]

[knocking on door]

[horse chuffs]

Hey, there.

Hey.

Is Dylan home?

No, I haven't seen him.

Could you
do me a favor?

Yeah.

Could you
put these inside for me?

Uh, sure.

Is that a gun?

Yeah.

Cougar.

See you.

See you.

Hello?

[engine rumbling]

Surprise!


I think, uh...
I had a feeling you'd be here.

I think it was
the Prius blocking my driveway

that tipped me off.

Right.
Oh, yeah, sorry.

Sorry about that.

Your gate was locked,

so I just figured
I would leave my car up there

and vault the fence
like an Olympic athlete.

You should've been there.

Well, do you want to come in,

or do you want
to keep sitting in pinesap?

Uh, well, I'll come in.

Right.

This is sort of
an awkward question,

but does sap
come out of jeans?

Yeah.

You have to soak them
in vegetable oil,

and kerosene
will get it out too.

Okay.

Um...

This is a really nice place.

Is this all wood?

It's all wood.

Um, it's really...

I mean, it's pretty out here.

It's...

a little remote.

You know, I had to...

I was giving...

I was doing a reading
at Whitman College,

and I figured
eastern Washington,

you live in eastern Washington.

I figured I would just,
you know... how, you know...

I would just come here
after the reading.

And, you know,
it seemed like

it was in the same
neighborhood-ish, and so I...

You know Walla Walla's
four hours away from here.

Yeah.

Yes,
almost exactly four hours,

as I learned
on the four-hour drive

from Walla Walla
to here.

Um...

But, you know,
it was a nice drive.

It was pretty.

People talk about
eastern Washington

like it's some kind of
fucking hell on earth,

but I thought it was
actually quite pretty.

Um...

That's a lot
of logs out there.

Again, the wood theme.

We're in the woods.

Yes, literally.

But yeah, I just...

you know, I'm not in eastern
Washington all that often,

as you may or may not know.

But I just figured...
I don't know...

I really... thought
I was gonna be here,

you know, you lived here,

and I just thought
it would be nice to...

How'd you find the place?

Uh...

I went to your office
looking for you,

'cause that was
the address I had.

And...

they told me
where you live with, like...

I could've been anybody.

I still got really, incredibly,
super-embarrassingly lost.

Do you want
something to drink?

Yes.

That would be great.

Anything
would be really good.

I've got beer
or heavy cream.

Hm.

Let's...
I'll start with beer.

And then we'll just
sort of see how it goes.

Thank you.

Um...

So I was in here earlier
before you showed up.

I came inside.

I've been here for a while.

And I was outside,
sitting there,

and your friend

with the horse
and the gun,

he gave me that bag and said,
"Please put it inside."

He didn't actually say "please."

And he didn't give it to me
so much as throw it

around where I was,
but I got it.

And I came inside
and put it down,

and that was all.

I just...
and I went back out.

It's fine.

Okay, I just, you know...

like, I didn't want to just be
taking liberties and stuff.

Well, I'm sorry I wasn't here
when you got here.

I was out shooting pictures
for an article.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Um, you are a photographer also?

I'm everything
at this paper.

It's good to be everything.

What was the story?

Log jam.

You hungry?

Yes.

I'm incredibly hungry.

Are you hungry?

Yeah.

These aren't normal beans
either, are they?

They're not...
I mean...

Well, they're regular beans.

The thing
about having a beard...

food everywhere.

Instant leftovers.
Instant leftovers.

And you smell it
on your mustache the next day,

which can be good...

I guess
it depends on the food.

Yeah.
Yeah.

You want to probably
have to think about food

in a totally different way.

Yeah, well,
and you have to...

You think about not just
the smell of the moment

but the longevity of the smell.

And I really
have to be careful

not to smear it
all over my face,

like I usually do.

Yeah.

Yeah, I mean,
a typical night for me,

I'll just smear a jar of
peanut butter all over my body

and let the cats lick it off.

Yeah, yeah.

It's a good night.
Mm-hmm.

You still have that cat,
that black one?

No.

What happened?

[sighs]

Um...
[clears throat]

Well, it...

Technically,
she committed suicide.

[laughing]

I mean,
I don't think that cats do.

I don't think
that cats can.

It's just,
the cat fell out of a window

that, I mean, technically, she
couldn't have fallen out of.

She had to have jumped.

But I don't know.

It was... I mean,
it was really sad,

but it was also
strangely embarrassing.

And the people at the,
you know,

the animal control
were really, like...

they were really accusatory.

But it's not like I didn't take
care of the cat, you know?

I really...
You really loved that cat.

I loved that cat.

But, yeah.

She is...
she's gone.

That's too bad.

Well,
it's probably better off.

Um, yeah, dark
and also incredibly quiet.

Yeah.

It's, I mean...
it's scary.

For me, it's unsettling

just 'cause I never have,
you know...

I've never been out of the city
for very long.

It definitely
took some getting used to.

But you know,
you get used to it.

You definitely
get used to the quiet

and the dark and...

I've made some friends
with the local wildlife.

[chuckles]

What kind of animals do you have
to encounter around here?

'Cause I read a thing
that said black bear, you know?

Black bears are...
they're dangerous.

I won't lie to you.

Thank you.

For that,
I thank you.

I mean, they will...

If not
for the pork and beans.

They will kill you
as soon as look at you.

Yeah, 'cause they're bears.

And oftentimes,
they won't look at you at all.

They'll just...
they'll kill you without...

no look, swipe.

But they usually hide
in the mountains.

And they don't come out
unless there's no food

up in the mountains.

And so, I mean,
the bears kind of keep clear.

And we keep our doors shut,
and we throw away any...

we don't let food set out.

And there are rules
of living in the forest.

And, you know, you don't lie,
say, covered with peanut butter.

Um, okay.
Fair enough.

Oh, and there are big cats.

And there are, like,
mountain lions and cougars.

That guy with the gun...

Jim.
Jim.

He had a gun.

He had a rifle
across his lap.

And I was like, "Hey."

You know, I was like,
"Hey, fella, is that a gun?"

Yeah, Jim's pretty great.

He's very unique.

He's a great guy.

I mean, hopefully
you'll get to know him

if you decide to stick around,
but...

Um, I would love
to stick around.

Yeah, you should.
I mean, it's too dark to...

You're not
gonna find your way.

Yeah.

I mean, broad daylight,

there's no way I could
find my way back to my car

at this point.

But he said...
Yeah, he's like...

I said, "Is that a gun,"
and he's like, "Yeah."

And he just said, "Cougar."

[laughing]

Which, I assume,
means that...

I mean, that's probably
not the name of his gun.

He thought
that was your name.

[laughs]

That is my spirit name

and my spirit animal.

Yeah.

Yeah, so there's a cougar
on the loose?

Yeah, they keep him
in captivia.

Captivia.
I said "captivia."

I drive a captivia.

Bridge to Captivia?

Great book.

No, the cougars are...
they live here.

They live in the mountains,
and they live around.

Again, like bears,
if they feel threatened

or hungry, they'll come after
something with two legs,

but generally, they don't.

Any old thing
with two legs?

Yeah.

Mostly toddlers.

Well, toddlers are delicious.

They are delicious.

Actually, the sausage...

Toddler,
roasted red pepper, and corn.

That's what
they raise 'em for out here.

So there's one thing
I've been wanting to ask you

ever since I got in here.

Where is the other antler?

[laughs]

And did you...
I mean, did you bag this beast?

I mean,
look at the bone fragments,

and there's hair on there.

That's not my handiwork.

You could never
have done this when I knew you.

No, I didn't do it.

Where did you...
you didn't find it, did you?

I found it, yeah.

And it's attached
to the skull.

I guess I always
sort of assumed

that it just sort of started
right there on the scalp.

Well, hunters
are brutal sometimes.

They don't stuff
all of their kills.

They sometimes just hack it
to pieces in the woods.

Wow.
Yeah.

And drink the blood.
You've done that, right?

You've hunted and stuff?

Did you drink the blood?

Yeah.

Was it awesome?


No, I've never...
I haven't gone out hunting.

Well...

well, you'll be a man one day.

You can do that.

I'm a little concerned
with the fact

that you have so many
different kinds of beer.

But I guess that's just
the way it is in the country.

Well, this doesn't seem like
you have much concern for...

I know.
I mean, I'm getting over it.

Well, here's to, you know,
everything being good again.

I don't... you know,
I don't want you to think

that everything's all right.

I know it's...
it's good to see you,

and I'm glad
that you made it,

and I'm glad that, you know,
we had sausage and beans

and everything, but...

I...

I think you're still an asshole,
you know?

I'm gonna go outside
and think.

I need some air.

[door closes]

[wood splitting]

That was good.

I've never seen anyone
doing that in real life before.

It's called splitting wood.

You want to help?

Um, it's not that
I don't want to...

exactly.

Yeah.

Hey, you met Jim yesterday,
right?

Yeah.
Eric, Jim, Jim, Eric.

Hey, how's it going?
Hey, man.

Hey, did you want some coffee?

I think
there's some in the cupboard

if you want to make some.

Uh, okay.

Are you gonna split
all of those logs?

Yep.

We had to cut this tree up
the other day.

And now we're gonna burn it...
just out of spite.

Sometimes that's
the best thing you can do.

I'd love to help,
but I only brought this, so...

it just seems like it would be
an insult to everybody.

I'll make the coffee.

All right.

Are you guys
drinking coffee?

Yeah, I'll have some.
I'm good.

Okay.

Thanks, Eric.
Yeah.

Yeah!

I own you.

Do it.

You ever wonder
what it would be like

to bury an axe
into somebody's head?

Sure.

That's natural.

I just
think about it sometimes.

I say
we just fucking burn it.

Yeah, or blow it up.

Can we get
explosives in town?

Mm-hmm.

What would Dracula do?

Nothing.

Probably nothing,
yeah, he'd probably...

Do absolutely nothing.
Turn into a bat, at best.

And leave.

Yeah, he'd...

Make like Dracula
and leave.

Yeah.

This doesn't
make any sense.


Um, so could you make a...

like a burl clock
out of that

even though
it isn't technically driftwood?

Yeah, that's kind of
what I planned to do.

Actually,
there's one inside there.

You just have to find it.
Yeah.

That's the sculpted...
I've got to... I've got to...

I've got to make sure that
I get it out of the wood intact.

Um, well, I was just
in there reading the book

about spiders
and their kin,

and I got
a little creeped out,

so I thought
maybe I'd go for a walk.

So anything good
to see around here?

Yeah, you know what?

There's a path
down to the river right there.

It just goes right down.

You have
to stay to the right,

but just...
you'll see it.

It'll take you
to the river.

And...

Jim, did you say
there was a cougar around?

Yeah, he's around.

Uh, is it likely

that I'm going
to run into him or anything?

Well, if you do, scream.

Yeah, make yourself...

just make yourself
big and loud.

Just make... just, like,
stand as tall as you can.

Right?

Yeah.

Really?

Just if I see it anywhere,

just be really...

I don't want to maybe just,
like... I don't know...

Well, you could run.

Yeah, but the cougar
can run really fast.

Yeah, you don't want to run.

Well, you know,
you're damned if you do...

Right.

They're hard to predict.

But I think,
you know, big...

Loud.
Loud.

Um, all right,
maybe I should stay in

and read some more
about spiders.

It's a freaky book.
I don't know.

Yeah.

I mean, what are the odds?

It's a big river.

Yeah.

There's no way of knowing.

Cougars
don't like water.

Cats don't like water.

They tend
to stay away from rivers.

Especially
if they have rabies.

You know,
rabies is just hydrophobia,

fear of water.

That's not true.
Okay.

Well, I'm gonna go down there
and check it out.

Have a good time.
All right.

Stay to the right?

Yeah, to the right.

Just follow the...

My right?

Yeah, well,
not your right now.

Turn around
and to your right.

Okay.
Yeah, now to your right.

Okay.

Just stay on the path...

of righteousness.

Nice axe work there, buddy.

You want to trade
in a minute?

Yes.

Well, tough shit.

[making robot stomping sounds]

Rrr...

I have the strength
of ten trees.

Chopping wood all day.

That's... good.

Nice.

What are you doing?

I don't know.

What are you, gay?

Yeah, probably.

Play a little T-ball,
little stickball.

Jesus.

What the fuck...

I'm gonna fuck this rock up.

Do it,
do it, do it.

Do it.

Here's a good rock.

Hey, who wants to join
the polar bear club?

Thought the cougar got you.

That cougar
was no match for me.

What's happening?
How you doing?

Hey, I'm not doing anything,
just checking out your river.

Yeah, it's pretty nice, huh?

It is, you know,
for a river.

I mean,
I've seen better, not many.

Do you want
to skip some rocks?

Yes, I tried
to do that earlier.

It didn't
work out that well.

I don't think
I ever gained that technique.

Maybe it was just
the poor rock selection.

Yeah, that's probably it.

I'm sure
that's what it is.

My technique
is obviously flawless.

I'd blame the rocks.

It's a poor musician
who blames his tools.

Something like that.

I'm working on it.
I'm not ready yet.

What have you guys
been up to?

Chopping wood all day.

[somber guitar music]

# #

Hey, Dylan,
did you get those books?

They're in the green bag,
actually.

Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

This one's really good.

The women...
or <i>Women.</i>

Yeah.

You've read Bukowski,
haven't you?

Uh, yeah, yes.

Not extensively,
but I've read some Bukowski.

You should read more.

He's the Shakespeare of
drinking, fucking, and puking.

[laughs]

I think that's...

I think that's probably true,
actually.

Although, you know, there
is some drinking and fucking

in Shakespeare,

not a lot of puking.

That's where he comes in.

Yeah, I mean, I really...

I have to admit
that I sort of...

I had a Bukowski period.

Bew-kowski.

Where you liked Bukowski?

Well, I mean...

I don't know.

I guess I just sort of
go back and forth,

'cause I feel like he was
a drunk and a, like, wife beater

and a, like,
total degenerate slob.

But he did dedicate
his life to writing,

so you got to admire
at least his dedication.

But there's
moments in the poems

that are really
pretty beautiful.

I mean, whatever.

I haven't really read...

I haven't read all of it,
'cause I don't think you can.

I think, like,
you could start today

and never read everything
he ever wrote.

Fuck.

That's some...
that plum brandy is pretty good.

I brought another,
my friend.

All right.

I'll match your tongue.

So how did you get into...

how were you introduced
to Bukowski, Jim?

Friend of mine.

We were younger.

Yeah.

He read everything.

I don't read that much,

so everything he read
back in high school

I've been reading
one book at a time per year.

So he's an easy read.

I mean...

I don't like
to read that much,

but I do like...

he keeps it pretty simple,
so...

One book per year
or one book at a time...

I usually finish a book a year
and start about three.

I always find myself
able to finish Bukowski

because he doesn't fuck around.

There's no...
nothing.

I can understand
what he's saying.

There's no even compound
sentences, really.

Yeah.

Which is pretty good,
actually, if you can do that.

I think he's good.

Yeah, I mean,
I had real problem with him

at a certain point, 'cause
I thought it was, you know,

artless.

But now that's sort of
what I like about him.

He's got something.

He's got cirrhosis
of the liver.

Well, he did.

Yeah.

Got to have something.

So what do you do, man?

Um, I write books.

That's what Dylan told me.

He told me you wrote words.

I do write words, largely.

I specialize in words.

But when they come
all together,

they turn into books,
when it goes correctly.

And I usually finish about one
every two years.

If you're writing
or if you're reading?

Writing.
I read a few more.

You write
about twice what I read.

Or half.

I write half
of what you read.

You got me on that one.

I'm not a math magician,
but...

Another to mass magicians,
mass magicians.

To the mass magicians.

And all night long,

I was just trying to, like,
you know, saying charming things

to get her to sort of notice
that I was sitting next to her,

but she just never did, the
whole night, the whole night.

And it was like ten hours.

But she was sitting
this close to you?

Yes, and I think maybe
one time she looked over

and went like this

and then went back over
to her boyfriend.

And I was just, like,
feeling increasingly alienated

and dislocated and just, like...

I don't know.

The way my life was
at that point was very bizarre.

And anyway,
she stood up at one point

and was talking to somebody else
that was passing by

'cause it was just a night...

everybody in this bar
was, like, really famous

with the exception of myself
and maybe one or two waiters.

And she stood up at one point,
and she had...

I mean, her ass was right there
in front of my face,

like, it couldn't...

Like, my face could've been
inside her ass,

'cause it was
that close to me.

And she stood there for
what felt like... I don't know...

like a half an hour
talking to this person.

And her ass paid more
attention to me than she did

the whole night long.

And I was looking at it,
and, I mean, I felt weird

'cause her boyfriend
was right there.

And I didn't...
I mean...

But then again,
at the same time,

it's Liv Tyler's ass,

you know, like literally
right in front of my face.

And I was staring at it
because it was hypnotic.

And I just didn't...
I just had...

there was nothing
I could do

but look deep, deep into
the soul of Liv Tyler's ass,

which was at eye...

we were making eye contact.

If her ass had eyes,

I would've been looking deep,
deep into her eyes.

And then she sat down
next to me,

and I felt like
I had a secret from her

that I didn't know how to tell.

And it was really awkward.

And, you know,
sooner or later,

she gave me another, like...

And then her boyfriend
gave me a look

that I couldn't
really quite decipher,

like, it was...
like maybe he knew.

But I'm sure he looks
at her ass all the time.

He probably gets tired
of looking at it, actually.

So there I was,
and that was the night.

And I just sort of felt
like that was the level

that I had reached in life.

Like, I got to be at the table
with Liz Tyler,

but I only got
to talk to her ass.

Have a telepathic conversation
with her butt hole.

Now, did...

Teach her how to smile
and use a period.

[laughing]

That's what I'm talking about.

Yeah, a little punctuation.

That's true.

Is there any more...

Serbian.

It's not Serbian, dude.

All right, this is
to Liv Tyler's asshole.

I feel like
I shouldn't drink to it,

'cause it's like violating
a friendship or something.

Shut up.

[glasses clank]

Shut up.
Shut up.

God!
Fuck.

I wish I knew
some Polack jokes.

I think
that would liven the mood.

Yep.

What's black and white
and has a dirty name?

What?

Sister Mary Fuckface.

[laughing]

I can never remember a joke.

I can't either.

I always... but that's something
I really wish I knew how to do

is tell jokes,

but I just
could never do it.

Play jokes... or tell jokes
and play an instrument.

I could never do
either one of those.

You could play.

I really, really can't,

as Dylan
will happily tell you.

Don't get me started
on this administration

and the immigration policies,

because I didn't come here
to talk about politics.

I came here to drink.

What did you...
I came here to drank.

Drank.

And I'm gon' drank.

Drank.

I'm here to drank,
and I'm gon' drank.

I came here to drink.

I came here to drink
plum brandy

from Serbo-Croatian territories.

I thought you weren't
gonna talk politics.

It's inevitable.

It's...
it's ineluctable.

Now you're just
making up words.

It's incontrovertible.


[guitar strumming]

# #

You guys
are fucking boring me.

I thought
that was just the music.

Yeah,
maybe that's what it was.

Uh, don't eat those.
Those are terrible.

Those are ends.
Those are ends and pieces.

Dog food.

Tits and vits.

Give me it.

What do you guys wanna do?

I want to rock.

I think we should try
to catch that cougar tonight.

Yeah, I agree.

[guitar plucking]

Have you not learned
a new Spanish guitar riff

in the last 2 years?

I'm serious.

I think we should get
that fucking cougar tonight.

Shut up, man.

Did you know...

that he has only ever
played that on the guitar?

That's the only thing
he can play.

That's one more thing
than I can play, in fairness.

But goddamn.

And it makes me
really popular at bullfights.

I think I'm gonna take
two more shots of that

and go find that cougar.

We're not hunting
a cougar tonight.

I'm gonna do it.

[snacks crumbling]

That could've been your face!

[laughing]

Hammer-on.
You like the hammer-on.

What is this?

I spent about an hour trying to
figure this out earlier today.

It's a puzzle.

I know it's a puzzle.

Dude...

I'm not trying to be...

a dick.

I'm not trying to,
like, bring...

What is wrong?

I'm not, but I mean,
even you can recognize

the irony
of you being a journalist.

There's nothing ironic
about that.

It's literally
the definition of irony.

Right.

You're a journalist,
and you flunked journalism.

I didn't flunk.
That's all I'm saying.

It's great.
It's a triumph.

I didn't flunk.
I took a W-.

Right, you got
a zero in it.

That's not flunking,
I guess.

I withdrew
with seven weeks.

I withdrew a W-
in the semester.

It was perfectly legal.

And I got an incomplete.

And what happens
to an incomplete?

What happens to an incomplete
if you don't make it up?

It turns into a 0.0.

I only say that 'cause it
happened to me like 20 times

before I dropped out of college.

It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

I'm not ashamed of it.
I didn't flunk.

Then why are you
so fucking uptight about it?

You're a journalist,
and you deserve congratulations.

You're totally
attacking me about this.

It's completely false,
and you're being hypocrit...

You're the fucking one
who's like...

You're the fucking hypocrite.

You're the hypocrite.

You're the one
who fucking came in here

all about Charles Bukowski.

I love Bukowski.

How many hours
did I have to listen to you

talk about how much
you fucking hated Bukowski?

"I hate Bukowski.
Oh, Bukowski.

"Anybody who reads Bukowski
is a fucking subliterate

"pseudo-intellectual
moonshine-jockey redneck

who doesn't deserve to breathe
the air we all breathe."

How... like, you just went off
about Bukowski

and how much you hate him.

Fuck you both!

You shut up!

Let's go hunt this cougar.

I'm serious.

What, you want to go
hunt the cougar right now?

Yeah, let's fucking go.

All right.
Let's go.

Fucking let's go.
All right.

I'm bringing this.

Do it.

Get a flashlight.

Fuck you.

[heavy breathing]

It's fucking cold.

It's fucking dark.

Shh!

So how much do you know
about cougars, for real?

They're more scared of us
than we are of them.

That's what they say
about every animal,

and yet animals
kill people every day.

Yeah, bec...
shut up.

I mean, can...
they can...

So let's say there's a cougar
right over there.

You have to pretend
you know what I'm talking about

because I'm pointing,
and it's pitch black.

It can see us, right,
'cause it has night vision?

I'd say that puts us
at a disadvantage.

God, this is ridiculous.

What is it...
how does a cougar...

how does a cougar kill?

Does it, like... does it swipe you
with its massive paw, or...

Shut up.

Does it eat you alive

and show you
your own beating heart

while you're still dying?

I'm only asking
because I want to know.

You know,
cougars out here?

Yeah.

Those are
the least of your worries.

You got to watch out
for black bears.

Those things are mean too.

They don't
kill you right away.

They'll tear off a limb and just
wait for you to bleed out

and just watch you
and play with you.

And you can only hope

that the cougars get to you
first out here, man.

Black bears are the worst.
They'll fuck you up.

You're fucking with me.
None of that's true.

You said before,
black bears are no big deal.

Yeah, they're no big deal
if you're not around them.

They're no big deal if they're
behind, like, glass...

Or dead.

Well, yeah,
not that much of a big deal

if it's behind glass or dead.

Except werewolves.

And zombies are bad.

And Frankensteins.

Even those are undead, but...

Have you ever seen
an undead black bear?

Not yet.

What about...

What about Edgar Winter's
<i>Frankenstein?</i>

If we run in to Edgar Winter,

you have my permission
to kill him and eat him.

I'm gonna play with him first.

I'd advise against it.

I'm not ripping off
his fret hand, though.

That would be...
That's just mean.

That would be
a crime against humanity.

That's just mean.

Is it Edgar Winter,
or who's the other Winter?

Shelley?

Shelley...

Shh!

Okay, so the trail
sort of ends here.

We've kind of
got to blaze our own.

What we're gonna do
is hop over this log

and take a left
and jump over these trees.

There's a little barbed wire,
so watch out.

[laughing]

Okay, I know...

I'm glad you guys
think this is fucking funny,

but this cougar is smart,

and I think
he's following us.

So if you want
to live through this,

you'll do what I say.

Get down.

Get down.

I think
we're almost there.

I've seen him
up on this ridge before.

Uh...

We're gonna flank him
to the left.

Be really quiet.

Follow me.

Did he just say "flank him"?

Yeah, I just realized
that the cougar was the mascot

of my junior high school.

I'm not sure
how I feel about this anymore.

We should follow him.
Yeah.

Have any more of that brandy?

Did you bring the brandy?

Uh, I dropped it...

back a ways when
we were crossing that ravine.

Fuck.
This is the wrong place.

What?
What?

Wrong ridge.

We got to...

We got to turn...
The ridge.

I can smell...

Fuck.

Dude...

Yeah.

We'll never get to Mordor
at this rate.

[laughs]

It's like the word
"douchebag," you know?

Like, everybody says it again,
and that's great,

but we live in a relatively
douche-free world.

Yeah, nobody douches.

Shut your fucking mouths
and keep up with me.

Okay.
All right.

Well, if you're French,
douching makes a lot of sense.

Yeah, that's true.
That's just good policy.

I said, "Shut the fuck up!"

Okay, okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Put the gun down.
Jesus Christ.

You two fuckers stay here
and don't follow me.

I could give a shit
what happens to you.

He just pointed a gun...
Yeah.

At you.
At you.

You were laughing.

He pointed...

Jim, be careful.

I think there might be
a cougar out there.

That's weird.
That's unusual.

That's the first time that's
happened to me in a while...

with a gun being pointed at me
by some weird dude.

Uh, where did he go?

Um...

That was really...
I was a little scared.

Yeah, well, it's weird,

like when a gun
gets pointed at you

and the person holding it
looks like they might actually

want to kill you...

Is he always like that?

He's intense, you know?

He's a little intense.

Well, at least it's freezing.

Yeah.

Um, do you know
where we are?

No, I have no idea.

Well, that's good.

Hey, um, you know
what this reminds me of?

This reminds me of that time
we stayed up all night drinking

and then went out in the forest
to hunt a cougar.

[laughing]

I remember that.

I think I've just been dumped.

You mean
by a heterosexual male friend?

I know.
It's weird.

Has that ever happened to you?

I think I would remember.


[somber guitar music]

# #

Yeah, I've always wondered
about, you know, like,

noise-canceling headphones,
that technology.

I don't understand
why they can't just use it

for a house or a car
or something.

You should do that here.

Or a person.

[laughs]

Yeah.

I would love that.

I'm sorry, dude.
Are you trying to sleep?

Noise-canceling technology
for people.

[mimics white noise]

That would be so great.

That would be great.

Hey, Eric.
[mimics white noise]

[laughing]

Okay.

Oh, um, geography question:

do you know
the capital of Thailand?

Don't.

That was not...
I totally wouldn't.

I'm serious.

I'm serious too.

I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.


Doing the crossy, eh?

I got to say, man,

this is a pretty
amazing life you have here.

It's really...

it's really unexpected,

but it's really, like...
it's impressive.

It's really beautiful.

I mean, even the air.

You're so full of shit.

Why is this shit
always so fucking hard?

All right.


Um...

so we should, you know,
do this again sometime.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, next time,
let me know,

and I'll get
a parking pass for you.

Okay, that would be great.

Excellent.

All right, well, that's
something to look forward to.

Safe drive.
All right, see you.
