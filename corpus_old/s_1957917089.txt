His love endures forever."

He has become my salvation."

Someone to think about?

A mama?
[Tomas shudders]

Then rememberâ€¦

This is just work.

Same as you always done. Just work.

[flies buzzing]

God is with us.
[breathes shakily]

How can you say that to him?

"God is with us."

Wh-Where... Where... Where is he?

And why has he not set you free? Hmm?

Or has he?

Oh. So... So you...
You are... are not in these?

Well, then stand upâ€¦

Stand upâ€¦ [breathing heavily]
â€¦G-Go. Stand up.

Stand up, a-and praise your God
for all he has done for you,

for-for-for-for all of us.

[breathing shakily]

You. [breathes shakily]

God is not with you.

He is nowhere. [breathing shakily]

And he sends that fool to...
To tell us about his word.

To-To be a good slave.

To-To-To-To-To be obedient
to your masters.

Is that what God says to you? [sniffles]


I do not know whyâ€¦

God shows himself to some people
and not to othersâ€¦

But if you do not know himâ€¦

I will pray for you.

[breathing heavily]

that you can move a mountain.

But faith without work is dead. Faith!

It's okay to work and die for your master.

Faith is obedience. Be obedient.
[laborer] Come on down. Hold it, hold it.

Bring it down. All right, all right. Yeah.

[priest] Faith. Give unto the Lordâ€¦
[laborer] All right. Keep moving.

There we go. Up, up.


Look alive. Look alive. Okay. All right.

[Tomas panting]


Steady yourself. Long day out here.

Water break!

Not you. Not you.

"All who's under the yoke of slavery

You, you. Water.

[sergeant] Back to work.
[soldiers, laborers coughing]

"And God has revealed his very will to me.

And so, I issue Proclamation 95."

What the hell's that mean?


What?


Get on, boy.
Fetch us a couple tins of water.

[sergeant groans] Desperate man, Lincoln.

You know, according to one of these other
papers from a couple weeks back,

slaves are running to Baton Rouge
from every direction

Fixing for liberty. One and all.

[spits, groans]

Come on. Hurry up.



Hey, keep moving.

Slaves are free.

Free?

[laborers coughing]

Says who?

Lincoln. We must get to Baton Rouge.
Lincoln's army is there.

It's true. I heard it also.

[guard 3] Bring it up! Let's go.

So, where is Baton Rouge?

Five days through the swamp.

There are many ways to die in a swamp.

There are many ways to die here.

If you go, I'll follow.

W-Which way?
[all panting]

Swamp.

Horse trail. It's faster.

No, too dangerous.


[Peter] They have more.
I am going.

Do not.
You are not my master.

He is too brave. I follow you.

No, we must go our own way.

Harder to track.

You abandon me?

Never.

Go through the swamp.

Follow the sound of Lincoln's cannons.

Go.

What if he don't come back?

Your papa is going to be back.

Do not ever stop believing that.

Hey?

[in Haitian Creole]
Your papa is going to be back.

Do not ever stop believing that.

I've seen your papa survive things
most men can't.

When we came here,
they insisted that we change.

Change our namesâ€¦

â€¦our language.

They even tried to change who we are.

Your papa taught us to hold on.

Now it is our turn to do the same for him.

Hold on.

Hold on to each other.

Hold on.

[in English] Hey?

[in Haitian Creole] Hold on.

[in English] Huh?

Come, come, come.

Open her up.


[sidekick grunting]
[sidekick 2] Ain't nothin' in him.


Ah, yeahâ€¦ [sighs] â€¦look at that.

Our boy fixed a gator. [chuckles]

[sidekick laughs]

How in the hell does an ignorant nigger
got knowledge like that?

You're the ignorant one
thinking like that.

My father was a corn huskerâ€¦

My mother passed when I was young, soâ€¦

the job of raising me
fell on our nigger house girl.

She took care of me. [grunts]

She fed me. She washed me.
She taught me thingsâ€¦

She was my friend.

One eveningâ€¦

I asked my father
if she could join us for supper,

and he looked at me in a funny way
and said, "Then what?"

I said, "So we could eat together,"
to which he asked, "Then what?"

I didn't know, I was just a boy.
But he did.

He saidâ€¦


â€¦"First, they eat our food,

then they'll take our jobs
and then they'll steal our land.

We give the nigger so much as a crumb,

they're going to take over
the whole damn country."

I was so ashamed. [stammers] Iâ€¦

I told him I'd been sneaking her food
when she was hungry.

He got real quietâ€¦

Called her into the dining room,
picked up a dinner knife andâ€¦

fixed her right there.

Left her in the field to rot.

Took her three days to die.

Last thing she said was, "Why?"

Hopped a train to St. Louis,
made my way down to Mississippi,

found myself in this here swamp.

And know what I saw?

I saw niggers, just like herâ€¦

running, hidingâ€¦ surviving.

People make 'em out to be ignorant,
but far from it.

In fact, what's worseâ€¦ [chuckles]
â€¦is they tend to be persistent.

[sidekick sighs]

See, one gets freeâ€¦

then another, then another,
then another, then another.

And someday,
they may return the favor on us.

Can you imagine?

Hmm.

She's almost as tall as you are now.

[Peter's partner] Betsy.

Then my children and I look forward

Yeah, children ain't going.


Well, Mr. Fabian said

No, that is not how this is.

You write down their names.
Lincoln say I am free.

Oh, he did? Well, that's a good thing.

Next time you see Lincoln,
please give him my compliments.

Right now you're in an army camp,
during a time of war.

Understand?

So you and everyone else who ran here
has a choice.

You'll work on one of the Federal farmsâ€¦

governed by this hereâ€¦
I will not.

â€¦set of rules and regulationsâ€¦
I will not.

Or you will join the army.

You help us beat these godforsaken devils,
my good man,

and you will not just
get back with your family.

You will help free your family.

And I'm sure your good friend Lincoln
will be mighty proud of youâ€¦

Mr. Peter.

Show this man to the Native Guard.

You're dismissed, soldier.

Next.

Gordon. Gordon! Gordon... Please, please.

Gordon. Gordon, my friend.
[groaning]

Good to see you, my friend.

Good to see you. How are you?
[exhales sharply] We made it.

Yes, we have.

John?


[groans]
I will come see you.

[groans]
Thank you.

[Native Guard soldier] Squad, attention!

Squad, at rest.

New recruits, eyes forward.
One arm-length from the next man.

Move up.

Welcome, Brother.

You pick up your uniform up there.

<i>Bonsoir</i>, Peter.

<i>Bonsoir</i>. They're going to let us fight.

They may not have a choice.

Be ready.


My leg is fine. You will not take it.

Your... Oh, no, no. We're not doctors, sir.

Noâ€¦ [stammers] â€¦uh...
We were alerted to your condition.

Uh... Well, with your permission,
we were wondering

if you wouldn't like to join us
for a few moments.

It's okay. They're good people.

A uniform will be waiting
when you get back. Yeah? Go on.

Right this way, sir.
Thank you, Sister.

All right.

It's called a camera.

What does it do?

Wellâ€¦

See, it, uh...

Makes a likeness of you.

Peter, we're gonna make sure
that every person in the world

knows exactly
what slavery truly looks like.

All right?

Now, um, if you could just
turn your back toward...

Do not touch me.

I'm sorry.

If... If you could turn your back
towards the camera, please.

And, um,

maybe put your arm out...

Your hand on your hip, like so.

And, uh, t-turn your head.

A little more. Yeah.

Is that comfortable?

Mmm.

[clears throat]

[watch ticking]

[clears throat] Thank you.

You were born a free man?

Yeah, that's right.
Bunch of us in this company.

Allowed to read and to write?

Allowed to do a lot of things.

If someone must allow you to do something,
then you are not really free, are you?


Sir?


Captain Cailloux
and Private Peter reporting, sir.

We know Johnny Reb has big guns
all along the ridge here.

It seems they're putting new ones
down here, along the river,

just south of Port Hudson.

Now if we don't open up this bend here
along the Mississippi,

we'll never control the South.

Hmm.

Is this the Negro here
that was running from Clinton?

Yes, sir.

What were you doing there?

We built the railroad.


It's okay.

Cannons.

Cannons?

Like them?

No, not like those.

Big cannons.

Did you see troops?

Many soldiers.

We've got to take Port Hudson
before those reinforcements arrive.

General, permission to speak?


Johnny Reb is dug in there real deep.

There's only one way in.

It's a killing field, sir.

I know what it is.

But somebody has to mount that attack.

How the hell did you survive
all those days in the swamp? Hmm?

I know the swamp.

Yes, wellâ€¦

doesn't mean you're fit for combat.

In closed circles,
there's the great Negro questionâ€¦

Are you fighters, or are you runners?

You know what I see here?

Disobedience.

Dismissed.

Come on, now.

Come on, boy. This ain't the time.
Come on, let's go.

I fight them.

And they beat me.

They whip me.

They string me up.

They sell me.

They throw me down a well.

They pull me out and beat me again.

And I fight them again.

They cut me.

They burn me.
They burn my neck. They burn my feet.

They break the bones in my bodyâ€¦

more times than I can count,

but they neverâ€¦

never break me.

Oh, we'll test that mettle.

Captain,

your men attack at dawn.

Dismissed.

You know, I used to run around New Orleans

calling myself
the blackest man in America.

You might got me beat.

[both chuckling]

Tomorrow on the battlefield,
you're with me.

[flies buzzing]

[soldier] Go first.
[soldier 2] Yep.
