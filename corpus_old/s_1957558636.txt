You're driving me to my grave,

Watch yourself, Sergeant Krupke,

you're gonna inflame your asthma,

shouting like that.
(LAUGHTER)

Why don't you leave
the Puerto Ricans alone, Riff?

Christ almighty. And you lot,

you're in New York now.

You got a problem, you call the cops.

Youse can't play
at being cops yourselves.

<i>Pero</i> we call the cops,
you show up and arrest us!

You're never around
when these <i>hijueputas</i>

mess up our stores and our streets.

See, I get confused
when you say "our streets,"

seeing how these streets
are ours by right

Who did that to your ear?

Ow!

Which one of them nailed you?

Who cracked your head open, <i>hombre?</i>

(SPEAKS SPANISH)
In English.

Same guy who nailed your ear, maybe?

Maybe. I don't remember.

I realise if any of you helps me out,

you might spoil your chance
to murder each other

over control of this earthly paradise.

The Jets control it and you know it.

Uh-huh, yeah,

but, golly gee, Balkan, not according

to the New York City Committee
for Slum Clearance,

which has decided
to pull this whole hellmouth

down to the bedrock,

and you're in the way.

Aah! (SHUDDERING)


Nice reflexes, <i>muchacho.</i>

So, any day now,

all of you are gonna be evicted.

You'll have to "vamoose,"
as we say in Spanish.

We're not relocating.

(MAN SPEAKS SPANISH)

We have rights.

Rights, huh? Where are they?

(BERNARDO GROWLS)
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

You back down, Bernardo.
Don't be stupid.

Some night, <i>muchacho,</i>

'Course, you'll have to leave

(ALL CONTINUE SINGING)

(CROWD CHEERING)

We're outnumbered, boys.

Thousands more are on their way,

and once they're here,

they pop out kids like crazy.
Am I right?

Tell me which one of them
nailed Baby John's ear

and I'll put him out of circulation.

Work with me, fellas.

Or they're gonna drive you
off your turf.

You said it was
the Slum Clearance Committee

that was driving us off,

now it's the PRs.

You gotta get your story straight,
Lieutenant Schrank.

We're very impressionable.

Most of the white guys
who grew up in this slum

climbed their way out of it.

Irish, Italian, Jews.

Nowadays, their descendants
live in nice houses

and drive nice cars

and date nice girls you'd want to marry.

Your dads or your granddads stayed put,

drinking and knocking up
some local piece

who gave birth to you.

The last of the
can't-make-it Caucasians.

What's a gang without its terrain,
its turf?

You're a month or two away
from finding out,

one step ahead of the wrecking ball.

And in this uncertain world,

the only thing you can count on is me.

I'm here to keep the civil peace

until the last building falls.

And if you boys make trouble

on my turf, Riff, hand to heart,

you're headed to an upstate prison cell

for a very long time.

By the time you get out,

this will be a shiny new neighbourhood
of rich people

in beautiful apartments

with Puerto Rican doormen
to chase trash like you away.

Wait!

I got a question for you, Lieutenant.

How tall did you used to be before you,

you know, "schrank"?

(JETS LAUGHING)

Come on, Sergeant, ride with me.

Long as I know you, Riff,

you ain't had the sense,
God gave a pigeon.

RIFF: Come here, let's see what he done.

Come on.

Well, that's gonna scar, buddy boy.

You think so? (CHUCKLES)
Frankenstein time.

They can't make us up and leave.

We're here, ain't we?

American citizens,
which them spics ain't!

Them they can chase off, not us.

Puerto Ricans are Americans,

you ignoramus.
Ah, go eat a green banana!

Puerto Rico's like a state,
ain't it? So, Deez is right...

BABY JOHN: No, it's something else.

JETS MEMBER: There are only 48 states,

ya dead battery.
What do you know?

(LAUGHTER)
Whatever they are,

citizens or who gives a fart,
what we know is...

JETS MEMBER 2: They ain't us.

So, spill it, Krazy Kat,
what are you thinking?

(METAL CLINKS)

I'm thinking it's past time
for a rumble.

For a all-in, all-out, once-and-for-all,

winner-takes-all, high-noon-shootout-

at-the-O.K. Corral rumble!
(ALL SHOUT EXCITEDLY)

BALKAN: Wild blue yonder! About time!

We do 'em like we done
the Egyptian Kings.

And the Emeralds.
And the Bishops.

Alright, so Tony and me
will sit down with...

JETS MEMBER: Tony?
Yeah, Tony.

JETS MEMBER 2:
What's this got to do with him?

He ain't stood with us
once since he got out.

He's on parole.
He's gotta be careful, is all.

He cannot be running around...

Tony's done with the Jets, Riff.

He ain't done with the Jets.
Like that's even a thing!

You cannot be done with this family.

Maybe it wasn't a thing before,
but now, Riff?

The Lieutenant's right.

What are the Jets
if we got no territory?

JETS MEMBER: That's right!
ALL: Yeah.

Schrank doesn't know
his ass from his elbow.

Look,

Tony and me started the Jets

cause none of us would even be here

if it wasn't for all of us.

And all you know it.
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

You're a Jet all the way</i>

(CARS HORNS HONKING)

So, meet Tony and me
at the Dog Days Dance

at the gym tonight.

We can't rumble at the gym,
it'll be lousy with cops!

And maybe we've had enough trouble

with the Puerto Ricans for one day?

Relax. It's a social mixer.

So we'll mix until the time's right

to fix the rumble for tomorrow night.

Be there 10:00 p.m., punctual-like,

dressed to kill, walking tall!

We always walk tall! We're Jets!

The greatest.

You're the top cat in town</i>

<i>You're the gold-medal kid

<i>You're the swingin'est thing

<i>Our cylinders are clickin'</i>

<i>The Sharks'll steer clear</i>

<i>Here come the Jets
Like a bat out of hell</i>

<i>Someone gets in our way

<i>Here come the Jets

<i>Better go underground</i>

<i>Better run, better hide</i>

<i>We're drawin' the line

(MUSIC ENDS)

Can.
RIFF: Come on.

Just for an hour, only a little hour.

You used to like dancing.

No monkeyshines.
Come on, Riff, can.

Christ almighty. You know,
there's dust on everything.

You know, ever since...

Hey, I swear on what's holy,

it is just girls sipping punch
and music...

And the Sharks.
And the spics.

And a rumble.
Which all you gotta do...

You're on your own, pal-o-mine.

...is help me haggle
over the terms of the rumble.

You don't need me helping ya
screw up your life.

You know how I get.
I will start runnin' my mouth.

You... You got command.

You are West Side legendary! And, Tony,

Tony, the Jets.
I gave 'em my word you'd show.

Why would you do that?
Because...

Because it's a rumble!

We need you if we're going to war.

You can't refuse us now.
And because I know you.

Or I thought I did,

before you got all unlike yourself,

before you went upstate.

WOMAN: Tony? (SPEAKS SPANISH)

I'm coming!

It's like you're still in prison,

and the old witch is the warden.

She gave me a job and a place to stay.

She's always been there
for me, like nobody else.

Oh, nobody, huh? Thanks, pal.
So don't call her...

Thanks a big fat lot. Yeah.

You know I didn't mean you wasn't there.

You was always there.

Womb to tomb.
Sperm to worm.

So, come with me to the dance, huh?

Come on.

Is it Graziella? That what's eatin' you?

No, it ain't Grazie. (CHUCKLES)

She said that you and she was done.

It's good that
you're keeping her company.

Even before you got locked up, you know?

It's cool. Don't get all
the way you get.

Grazie's a great girl,
and the Jets are the greatest.

And you, you're like,
you know, blood to me.

But I'm scared of myself, Riff.

What I done to that kid.
What I almost done.

You gotta get over that.

What is the point
in beating yourself up?

I wanna be unlike how I was.

Cause I was disappearing down a sewer

and taking you and everything with me.

WOMAN: Tony, you coming?
Yeah, he heard ya!

I had time. Lots of it.

Locked up like that,

and for the first time ever,
I took a look inside,

and that was rough, doing that,

but I... I gotta stay with myself.

You know what I mean? Maybe stay...

by myself, just for...

Yeah, you know what?

You're just too deep for me, kid.

You know, I don't know who I am.

And who cares who I am?

Nobody, including me.

I know that this dust

that's covering everything right now,

that's the four-story buildings
that was standing here

when you went upstate a year ago.

You know, I wake up to everything I know

either getting sold or wrecked,

or being taken over by people
that I don't like.

And they don't like me.

And you know what's left
out of all that?

The Jets.

My guys. My guys, who are just like me.

Who are just like you.

I can't go to the dance, Riff!

My parole officer said no going out!

I told you I don't want you in my store.

I'm a paying customer.

You've been stealing from me
since you were six.

Now, get out. I mean it.

And leave Tony alone.

He is not allowed to associate
with criminals.

Look, don't fall off that ladder.

At your age, brittle bones.
That's all I'm saying.

WOMAN: You'll pay for that candy.

Five cents. On the counter!

Stand me for a Milky Way, huh?
Least you could do.

Womb to tomb

wasn't never a joke for me.

Don't be like that.
(DOOR CLOSES)

Just cause I can't go to a dance?

Tony, I don't tell you
who to hang out with. But...

(IMITATES HER) "But those
boys are juvenile delinquent.

"They're no good for you.
And you better watch out."

Hey.

(IMITATES HIM)
"You make fun of the way I talk

"one more time, blondie..."
(SNORTS)

(IN NORMAL TONE) I'm gonna
talk to Riff and tell him

that he can't just
come in here and not pay.

Tony, wake up.

I know you love Riff,
but he hates Puerto Ricans.

That is not you.

Riff don't hate you.

I married a gringo.

He thinks that makes me a gringa,

which it don't. And I ain't.

Well, it's guys like Riff and me,

when things ain't familiar,

we just got this instinct to,
you know...

You...

even as an angry little boy,
somehow there was this...

this promise
that you couldn't keep hidden.

Not from you.

And sometimes, I see you smiling,

like you're waiting for the,

what do you call, Irish Sweepstakes,

instead of sweeping the floor
like I pay you to do.

I sweep as good as you pay.

Yeah?
Look it.


You see? Promise.

You bring dead floors back to life.

Six kids? Marry a cat.

I've been asking you for five years.

You want to marry me,
then leave the gringos alone.

You don't have a fight till next week.

The match with that Thompson guy.

What was his name?

Your brother has something
to say to you.

I apologise

for behaving last night like a...

Like a gangster.

(ASSENTS IN SPANISH)

It was embarrassing.

And he's apologising.

<i>PerdÃ³n.</i>

I'm a grown-up now, Bernardo.

I can dance with anyone I like.

As long as he's <i>puertorriqueÃ±o.</i>

But why? Tony's a nice boy.

Tony? (SPEAKS SPANISH)

Tony. Who cares if he's a...?

I don't know what he is. A Yankee?

He's a Polack. That's what he is.

A big, dumb Polack.

"Polack," says the spic.

Now you sound like a real American.

I don't want you to marry a gringo.

Marry him?

I danced with him, Bernardo.

For a minute, until you...

You're crazy.
I can't talk to you anymore.

(SPEAKS SPANISH)

I was OK on my own.

Just me and <i>Papi</i>
for five years without you,

while you came here,

You... You study, and you make money...

so that someday
I can rent a shop of my own

in this great, big,

Ah.

And if you think

Riff.

Well, get your brother to call it off.

Bernardo's too angry.

Well, Riff's angry, too, so...

Come on.
(TRAIN HORN TOOTS)

This place we're going,
it's, uh, up past Harlem.

It's practically
at the tip of the island.

My brother...

there's so much more
against him than Riff.

He's angry because...

The whole world has been against Riff

since he was born.

Do you think it's easier for us?

Uh, well, I think you come
from families, homes.

You and Bernardo, you have hope.

You think Riff has that?

Riff could have hope
if he didn't try to take hope

from people he doesn't know.

Riff didn't start this, it was Bernardo.

He came after me.

Just cause I wanted to dance with you.

Tony, if someone gets hurt
because of what we do...

What did we do to anyone?

We don't do anything wrong,
liking each other,

I don't just like you.

We can't pretend what we do
doesn't cause trouble.

I can't talk my guys
outta making trouble.

Trouble's what they're made of.

All of you go suck a pickle.

You think we're going to jail?

They're fishing, is all.
Asking questions.

Which we ain't answering.

So, you're gonna tell me

where and when the rumble's happening...

or I'm gonna send you
straight to the Tombs.

I don't know where the rumble is.

I don't even know what a rumble is.

Uh, they don't tell me nothing.

They know I can't keep any secrets.

They tell you when to show up, right?

Nah, they don't.

I just hang around
until somebody says "let's go."

And then?

I go.

First time I saw this place,

I was on a prison bus.

Up to the state prison in Ossining.

There was a rumble.

And I busted up this kid.

He was in the Egyptian Kings.

He only didn't die because of luck,

like, one more punch
and he probably would've died.

And I would've done it.

I would've murdered this messed-up kid

who wasn't no different from me.

And for a year in prison
and since I got out,

I can't quit thinking about
what I almost done.

I think about killing him, and...

and it's like I'm always
just about to fall off

the edge of
the world's tallest building.

I stopped falling the second I saw you.

GRAZIELLA: Don't hurt her!

Don't hurt her, please!

(MUSIC CONTINUES)
(BOYS GRUNTING)

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

What the hell are you doing?

You disgusting pieces of shit!

(MUSIC STOPS)
(VALENTINA SPEAKS SPANISH)

(ANITA WHIMPERING)

<i>Mija, mija.</i>
No!

(SHOUTS IN SPANISH)

Traitor!

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Go back where you came from.

You think I want to stay here?

In this city full of ugly,
little animals like you?

<i>No, gracias.</i>

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

Tell Tony... (SNIFFLES)

You tell that murderer...

MarÃ­a ain't coming.

Chino, he found out about them...

Tony and MarÃ­a.

He shot her.

MarÃ­a is dead.

You tell him that.

(DOOR CLOSES)

I know you.

I know all of your names.

Since you was born.

(VOICE QUIVERING)
I watched you grow up.

And you have grown into rapists.

You dishonour yourselves.

You dishonour your dead.

(DOOR OPENS)

What do we do now?

(DOOR CLOSES)

We're done.

(OBJECT RATTLES)

What was that? What was that?

You can never hear nothing
from down here.

Was it the cops?
No, no, no.

It was not police.
No, it was... it was...

Uh... Now it's alright.

Tony, let's sit down for a second, huh?

Listen. I got something to ask you.

No, no, wait. I... I...
I got something...

It ain't easy to ask this,
so let me just go, OK?

Wait, wait. I have something to...

You've given me so much already,

but when she gets here,

just...

If you could help us out
with the bus fare...

Tony...
I...

I have no idea what it's gonna cost

to get far enough away,
out west some place.

100 bucks for both of us.

And we'll get work when we get there.

We'll pay you back every cent.

I know you ain't got money,
so if it's too much to ask...

No, no, no. It's not too much.

It's not too much.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

We're gonna name
all our girls Valentina.

Hmm.
Cause if you hadn't cared

for me like you always done,

I wouldn't even be here alive, which...

maybe I shouldn't be.

Don't ever say that, Tony.

Life matters even more than love.

Mm. They're the same thing.

Before MarÃ­a,
maybe I would've said they ain't.

But now, it's all life is.

Even if it lasts no time at all.

A month, a day even.

That was Anita upstairs.

What's wrong?

Chino...

What?

Chino has a gun.

He...

Chino shot MarÃ­a.

He killed her.

She's... She's dead.

TONY: Chino!

Chino!

Where are you?

Chino!

I'm right here!


Chino!

Come on, man!

I'm right here!

I'm locking for you!

Come on! Come on, with me!

I know how to hide you.

I got places to go they'll never look,

just please!

Don't leave me here!

Get off of me!

Chino, kill me!

Kill me, too, Chino!


Chino!

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

No!

Don't!

(MARÃA SHRIEKS)


<i>Mi amor mio, mi corazon.</i>


MarÃ­a.

(CONTINUES CRYING)


<i>You're the only thing I'll see</i>

(VOICE QUIVERS) <i>Forever</i>

<i>In my eyes, in my words</i>

<i>And in everything I do</i>

(VOICE BREAKING)
<i>Nothing else but you</i>

<i>Ever</i> (SOBBING)

(TONY BREATHING HEAVILY)

(BREATHING STOPS)

(MARÃA GASPING)


(SAD MUSIC PLAYING)

(MARÃA CONTINUES SOBBING)

Give it to me.

(CHINO BREATHING SHAKILY)

How do you fire it?

Just pull this?
(BREATH QUIVERS)

How many bullets are left?

Enough for you?

And you?

All of you!

I can kill now because I hate now.

I hate now.

How many can I kill, Chino?

And still have one bullet left for me!
