Well Peter, I am continuing
to stand at the base

of the Richmond-Sanderfeld Bridge,

just moments from San Francisco Bay's

maximum security San Quentin Prison.

What we have seen so far today have been

local and federal law
enforcement officials

launching a massive manhunt
towards the apprehension

of escaped federal prisoners
Odessa and Kyle James.

United States Marshal Lorna McCoy,

with prison warden Samuel
Corothers, just moments ago

in what would have been
a rare public address

stated that yes indeed, both brothers

did in fact disappear from
the high security wing

of one of the country's most
notorious of all death rows.

We know it was sometime
before dawn this morning

and that one guard has been
confirmed dead on the scene.

Two others were taken to
Parkland Memorial Hospital

where they continue to be
listed in critical condition.

Peter, Susan, it was the
trial that stunned the nation

and now convicted killers
Odessa and Kyle James

are out amongst the rain, among us.

Convicted killers Kyle
and Odessa James are out.

Amongst the rain, among us.

(Suspenseful music)

(bell rings)

(trunk closes)

Do you have an eight?


Daddy needs to go fishing.

[Charles] Curses.

(Doorbell rings)

I'll get it.

Jenny, no running in the house.

(Doorbell rings)

I'll go too.

(Doorbell rings)

Dad, you would not
believe what a nightmare

it is out there.

The cops have roadblocks on the 101, 580,

even the one that leads into Timeron.

Hmm.

The James boys are here.

So I keep hearing.

Well you're drenched, honey.

Well, you better go get cleaned up.

On my way, Daddy dearest.

(Door closes)

(suspenseful music)

I was waiting on my own.

It was dark.

I was scared.

I was tired of being violated.

Tired of my brother being violated.

Then my brother was outside my door.

I joined him in the hallway.

He took me down until we
reached our parents' room.

He kicked open the door.

He went in, I went in after him.

He sent the first round into them.

And then we, my brother
and I, we both fired.

Oh, okay.

Movie.

Three syllables.


I know this one, The Naked Gun.


Mommy wins, Mommy wins.

How in the heck is that The Naked Gun?

Charles, she was clearly portraying

the very gallant Nicole Brown.

It was obvious.

Jennifer Lynn Ryan,
that was absolutely gross.

No I know I've talked to you about this.

Honey, the taking of a human life,

especially one that's a
young, innocent, beautiful,

voluptuous, ooh, perfect
example of femininity.

Not to mention she's a
pillar of the community.

It's a tragedy, it's an American
tragedy, plain and simple.

And how my wife of all these years

could've gotten The Naked Gun from that,

well, I'll tell you, it's
beyond me, I'm shocked, Rea,

absolutely shocked.

[Rea] But I win.

I've gotten myself all
worked up, over nothing.

Well, I guess we dwelled
on that long enough.

Who wants to go next?

Jenny, go tell your sister she's gonna

be late for work, please.

[Jami] So finish the story.

[Jenny] I already told
you, Dad turned it off

before the greatest hits.

[Jami] What pictures did they show?

Usual, trial proceedings, mug shots,

reaction shots of the verdict.

What about the sentencing?

Yeah yeah, they showed 'em laughing

when the judge sentenced death.

The McKenzie twins had it on satellite

first thing this morning.

One cop said that it was
Odessa who killed a guy,

probably was, that's why
Mom thinks he's so hot.

He's got that whole OJ
thing going for him.

Totally guilty, totally cute.

I like Kyle.

Well, I'm sure he'd be hot to trot

knowing miss just turned
12 was interested.

I did not just turn 12.

Well continue to pardon
me, miss two weeks later.

Did they really set
up road blocks there?

Yeah.

Can you believe it?

Motherfucking Beatty.

I hate this fucking town.

What are we up to now,
about population seven?

But it's named after the actor.

Beatty?

Warren Beatty, you mean?

Hardly, baby.

I think it was named after
the Greek god of boredom.

Do you think they'll come here, Jamie?

Who, Warren Beatty?

No, the brothers.

I don't know, honey.

But (clears throat) if
those boys know what's best,

they better help themselves south.

(Suspenseful music)

(thunder rumbling)

It's cold out there.

Honey, you're soaked.

Girls are there, no problem.

Jenny wanted to help her sister

so tonight she's gonna be doing that.

An assistant babysitter following

in the footsteps of an
official babysitter.

Honey, we should have an employee day.

Oh, don't forget to lock that door.

You can never tell in this day and age.

Assuming the James brothers will be

paying us a visit, Charles?

Better safe than sorry.

Better safe than sorry.

(Thunder crashing)


God dammit.

Ms. McCoy.

What?

Rupert MacAlister was
the lieutenant on duty.

Apparently he worked
the closing hours alone.

Caucasian male, 40
years of age, no priors.

Mr. MacAlister was a father of three.

His time card was punched
at nine p.m. sharp,

leaving behind a cash box
of $480 in credit charges

and $209 in cash coin.

And his '86 Ford Mustang,
California license

two Charlie Nevada five niner two,

was discovered abandoned by highway patrol

near check station 12.

And where was Mr. MacAlister?

In the trunk.

(Water running)

Nobody does dishes like you.

(Thunder crashes)

Charles, the power's gonna be out soon.

I hope.

Three,

two,

one.

(Thunder crashes)

Power's out.


Oh, for goodness sake,
on a night like this.

It's Jenny, she did
say if she was bored.

She's probably forgotten her key.

Sooner you get back,
sooner she's gonna be

in her bed asleep.

Charles, she's probably
soaked to the bone.

Probably.

Are you going to get the door?

Already left.

Go, get the door.

[Charles] I'm leaving right now.

Go!

(Suspenseful music)

Jesus Christ.

Nope.

(Suspenseful music)

Both of 'em if you want.

What do you need, clothes, money?

I got money, you can have
it, it means nothing to me.

You need a hostage?

I'm your man.

Please.

Please, I beg of both of you.

Do not hurt my wife.

You people always
have the same confusion.

To compare bravery and brilliance
with a lot of bullshit.

My wife means the world to me.

Please, just let her go.

My wife is the world to
me, please, just let her go,

how fucking noble.

There are people here in
this town, they'll find you.

They'll find you and arrest you.

Now why would people be looking for us?

Why?

Because you're Kyle James.

And that monster there
you call your brother.

[Kyle] He is my brother.

Yes.

The infamous Odessa Lee James.

You obviously benefit
upon knowing who we are.

As for you, I can give a fuck.

But that lingering flower,
the one there with the eyes

of an angel and lips of a god.

The one that gives you the
apparent strength of nobility.

My wife.

Rea.

Her name is Rea, Rea Ryan.

I'd like you to make me a drink, Rea.

Nothing fancy, nothing trivial.

I don't want you to become
creative on me, Rea.

So diminish those immediate
thoughts of heroism.

If you fuck with the drink, you die last.

If you die last, you are the winner.

It'll be an experience, Rea, to watch

your movements of expression
as I calmly and collectively

will gut the Mr. Fuck
you nobility man there.

If you're gonna talk like that,

you can just take it somewhere else.

I won't have that kind
of vulgarity in my house,

especially when it's
directed towards my wife.

Fuck you.

Charles.

Is this you?

Well it must be.

Yeah, one Charles Winwood
Ryan, you don't mind, do you?

Well, I guess you know you've
maxed out your Visa card.

All these penalties and interest.

Apparently you haven't been
making your payments, Charles,

and I'd say that puts you in some trouble.

Well, let's see here.

You could always get a loan from a friend

or steal an old lady's
handbag, or you might even try

selling assault rifles to
right-wing biblical adversaries.

The point is, regardless of what you do,

always pay what you owe, Charles.

You see, I'm a firm
believer that credit cards

were the fall for this country.

Buy now, pay later, the American dream

of owning what we can't afford

and spending what god knows we don't make.

You know what it is?

It's an organized crime
against the misfortunate many.

A corporate-made suicide for
a shattered middle class.

Why?

Why'd you do it?

Why did you kill your parents?

We've heard all the rumors.

All your endless rambling thoughts.

That ended up emblazoned
on the front pages

of the newspapers.

From the trash tabloids to
that bullshit autobiography

you used to set up your defense fund.

What was it?

What was it, physical abuse?

Mental abuse?

All those childhood charges
of molestation and sodomy?

There truth to any of that?

Charles, that's the only
thing that you can ask me,

the only question that's
been asked repeatedly

almost yearly, monthly, weekly, hourly,

and every motherfucking
moment in two state trials,

one goddamn state board appeal,

and one jack-me-off interview
with that bitch Ricki Lake.

I wish I could agree with the comradery

of those wishful thinking
statements of yours, Charlie.

Looking back now, as a
free man in confusion,

those were all indeed desperate
last minute solutions.

Thoughts that stormed high
towards the pending future

of a never-ending incarceration.

I killed both my mother
and father, Charlie.

Their death emerged slow.

It was filled with the
absolute agony of despair.

Only the darkness would cloud.

This was my end.

An ending of painless peace for a boy

who longed to see death.

Money brought motivation, Charlie,

and the motivation sought murder.

Tell me you were a good girl, Rea.

I was very good to you, Mr. James.

Odessa.

Odessa.

Charles, I'm curious, is this

your video collection over here?


My, what a vivid array of
shit you own, let's see here.

Crap, crap, crap.

Ha, this is the absolute
biggest piece of crap.

Free Willy, Charles?

You should die now.

You know what the only redeemable moment

of Free Willy is, Charlie?

That film I thought was quite suitable.

No it wasn't!

My brother takes this one
most personally, Charlie.

But to answer my own question,

Free Willy, redeemable points, only one.

Michael Madison smoking cigarettes.

We believe in family fair entertainment

in this household, Mr. James.

Regardless of what unstable individuals

like yourselves might think.

Well, wait a minute, I
owe you an apology, Charles.

Once Upon a Time in the West?

This is a classic, Charles
Bronson, Henry Fonda?

A tale of revenge and retribution?

That film belongs to a neighbor.

Of course it does.

Why?

Because quality and you would be like

a paraplegic trying to masturbate.

You try and you try and you try,

but you never quite
get it, do you Charles?

Kids, kids, kids, the rest of
this is a bunch of kids' crap,

and I'm having a hard time
picturing you watching this.

We have a child.

Our daughter.

She's moved away from home,
first year of college.

Presented with such
admirability, Charlie.

For the man who owns not
one Mickey Rourke movie.

When I look at your wife, Charlie,

I see a female, a young woman,

a goddamn wet dream pushing
the bounds of bewilderment.

Okay, let's go back here.

Charles, these are kids' tapes.

So tell us about the child.

Two.

We have two children.

Two girls.

Their expected arrival is when?

(Clears throat)

11.

Are they at a friend's house, Rea?

Maybe with a parent?

Someone who'll come to the door with them?

No.

Babysitting.

Tell me about your children, Rea.

Don't tell them any more.

Rea, I don't wanna
hate them at this point.

Two girls, babysitters, begin.

Jami, well, she's the eldest.

17, she's just now 17 years old.

Word just came down
from Parkland Memorial.

Both of the Quentin
guards certified deceased.

We got a statement though.

One of the guards, still semi-conscious,

says he overheard a voice.

Now he can't tell which one
of our lost boys he heard,

but a name came up.

Lennox.

Goddamn swear to Christ.

Boys are out, sent 'em down death row.

Kincaid, come back.

[Kincaid] Kincaid here, over.

Punch up a residential on
one Dick and Marlene Lennox.

[Kincaid] Richard and Marlene Lennox,

residential listing of
1135 East McConnell Way,

Beatty, California, 10 to five, May 1993,

on behalf of the federal government

and state of California
justice department,

superior court of San Francisco.

James, Odessa Lee, convicted homicide,

first degree, death, San Quentin.

James, Kyle John, convicted homicide,

first degree, death, San Quentin.

Witness protection withdrawn
December 12th, 1995.

Shit.

All available units to
1135 Eat McConnell, let's go.

First comers, use a door-to-door,
two-by-two formation,

subjects are armed, repeat,
subjects will indeed be armed,

possible hostage situation.

Suspects are two, Odessa James,
Kyle John, let's go, people.

(Engine starts)
(siren wails)

(lighter flicks)

(suspenseful music)

You ever have one of those days, Rea,

which eventually turns into this night,

which makes you stop and ask
the very question of why?

As a child, Rea, I had a dream.

It was the one true destiny
for which rightly I deserved.

A movie, Rea.

To write, direct, act, and produce.

Just one goddamn movie.

Shit, at least I can die knowing

I never bought any of that white bread

Leave it to Beaver,
don't walk in the rain,

home by dark theory shit.

My life, a tolerant tale,
where the good becomes poor

and the rich evil, and
life, Rea, just life.

One simple motherfuckin' life.

Life on the edge.

The American dream.

Charles and Rea Ryan, the happy couple.

Two daughters, championship.

(Suspenseful music)

(gate creaks)



(insects chirping)

(intense music)

Holy Mary mother of god.

(Suspenseful music)

(door closes)

Welcome home, honey.

Coroner's moving 'em now.

By his estimate, figuring
over 100, 150 stab wounds.

Time of death?

[Man] No.

What do you mean no?

No time of death, not yet, no.

Boys are pissing me off.

They're going down.

This very night, down in
fuckin' Pisswater USA.

And then I'm taking 'em
home back to Quentin,

where I personally am gonna gas

the second goddamn
fucking life out of them.

Beatty PD found a blood
trail about a half mile down.

Have it matched against both brothers.

[Man] Preliminary shows AB negative.

Kyle John James.


[Jami] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[Jenny] This is all I could find.

Perfect.


[Beverly] It's Beverly, Rea, open up!


She's just a neighbor.


Kyle, Jami, Jen, upstairs.

Miss Ryan, you and I
have a date with destiny.


It's Beverly, open up, Rea, open up!


Oh Rea, it's awful, the
Lennox family's dead!

Dick and Marlene?

And the children!

Oh god.

Don't you have your radio on?

They think it's those
convicts, the two brothers.

Beverly, now's not a real good time.

But Rea, where's Charles, shouldn't he

be helping the police?

He's in bed asleep, good night, Beverly.

But Rea, what about the James brothers?

I'm sure they're just fine
and a long ways from here,

so good night now, Beverly.

But Rea!


(gun fires)

(suspenseful music)

But out of all the towns,
Kyle, why would you pick here?

Jesus, Beatty?

I still can't believe my mother

is sitting down there with
your brothers like that.

(Mysterious music)

I like you, Kyle.

I like you a lot.

And I'm your biggest fan.


(suspenseful music)

Jenny, you were told to stay upstairs.

But I just wanted to
ask Mr. James something.

And what is that, darling?

Mr. James sir, can I get your autograph?

(Suspenseful music)

Those two I met because of Daddy.

He has such great connections.

Jerry Mathers and Bob Barker?

God damn, Charlie,
whose dick did you suck?

Mr. James, wait!

Wait!

Okay, okay, sorry, I'm sorry.

It's just that he's my absolute favorite.

Adam West, he's such a dream.

Can you hear it, Charlie?

The pounding of the bed frame?

The screws turning, bolts falling?

Sweat angels and the pants.

The pant, Charlie.

The try to be quiet so no one
will know we're fucking pant.

God damn, look at him go. (Laughs)

Word of advice, Charlie, my brother,

bay captain of boating.

He ties a knot, unmovable.

So Mr. Ryan, sir, don't move.

I wanna hear your daughter fuck.

They came.

Ravishing Rea, one widower to Charlie.

So what do you say, Rea?

Testimony and tea or Mexico, you and me?

Mexico.

Think it, Rea.

Mexico, the American
dream elsewhere found.

(Mysterious music)

I know the brothers.

I know 'em both.

I used to have lunch
with them down at county.

For two years, that
boy sat across from me.

Just watching.

He never feared death like most of us do.

Because how can you fear death

when you never lived your life?

And then he was alone.

Kyle was hospitalized
during a jailhouse brawl.

And that was the day I saw through him.

Past him.

And I asked him for the truth.

And I asked him why.

One solitary tear slid down his face.

And then he said, "revenge."

You fell for them, didn't you?

Yeah.


(suspenseful music)
(door opens)

(gun firing)

(insects chirping)

(mysterious music)

Beverly?

Beverly!

(Suspenseful music)

Hughes, come back.

[Hughes] Not a goddamn thing, ma'am.

What do mean not a goddamn thing?

Who the fuck do you
have out there with you?

(Hughes laughs)

[Hughes] Half of this
piece of shit county,

local boys from Frisco and half
of the damn National Guard.

Hmm.

Yeah.

Dawson, Samuel, where's he at?

[Hughes] Hell if I know.

[Dawson] Go for D.

Mr. Dawson.

What's this crap I'm hearing about you

convincing the James boys to surrender?

[Dawson] Yeah, well,
we certainly didn't shove

any rocks down their throats.

Ha ha ha, what a dick.

[Dawson] What do you wanna
do with his dick, ma'am?

[Hughes] Eh, go fuck yourself with it.

Two words, assholes.

Traffic duty, so over and
fuckin' out, good fuckin' bye,

fuck you, and I'll see
you fuckers in hell.

Beverly.

No.

You sure it wasn't backfire,
or a firecracker possibly?

I was in World War II, god
dammit, don't you go tellin' me

what you think I heard.

(Dog barking)

Now, your wife Beverly.

Let's go back to her for a second.

She went to check on the neighbors.

She went over there.

She went to that house, right there,

the one I been tellin' ya about.

Jesus Christ almighty on a goddamn crutch.

Now, you said that the gunshot

came from that general vicinity.

(Man sighs)

Son, the gunshot came from
that house, right there.

It came from the Ryan house.

Mr. And Mrs. Charles Ryan.

Oh Miller, shut up.

And what is that?

Go get the uncut on Charles and Rea Ryan.

Go.

The phone, well it ain't
been workin' since the storm,

and well Beverly, she wanted,
well she wanted to help,

and I didn't want her to
worry, you know, she worries.

And Charlie, well he's such a hard worker.

And well, ever since the storm,

she wanted to go over and make sure Rea

didn't have any problems, you know,

with her being alone with
the children and all.

Children?

Yes ma'am, two girls.

Sweetest little darlings I ever did meet.

Kincaid, Dawson, Hughes,
we have a possible situation

at 1313 Schoolyard Road.

(Suspenseful music)

Christmas fuckin' Eve.


Inspired, man.

Fuckin' A poetry.

And to think, the holiest of holiest days.

Merry Christmas, Dad.

Boom.

Stocking stuffer, Mom?

Boom.

Inspired.

In-fuckin'-spired.

The flicker of yuletide lights.

Off-green artificial tree.

Carolers.

The patter of eight tiny
reindeer and small jingle bells.

Oh what a silent night.

That is of, unless you don't wanna count

the 27 double buck
rounds which are blasted,

pounding, and ripping into
both you and your better half.

Christmas goddamn motherfuckin' Eve.

Yeah.

I'd have done it then.

One shit-kicked homicidal holiday.

So, Kyle James, you wanna
fuck me again, killer?

Jami, do you watch a little TV?

[Jami] What?

TV.

We had a TV in prison and I used to spend

all my time watching it.

Watching all those white trash programs.

And I would wonder if those
people really did exist.

And now I'm here with you
and now I know that they do.

Do I wanna fuck you?

Yeah.

That's all anybody would
ever wanna do with you,

and since we already did that,

why don't you just take your cute ass

and go make my fucking dinner.

(Jami laughs)

[Jami] You're kidding.


No.

You know what I think?

I think you've been bent over
one too many times, Kyle.

I think your tired little white ass

can just go on and serve itself.

[Kyle] Jami.

What?

[Kyle] Please.

Fuck you.

We got all you can eat in the pantry.

[Kyle] And I can find
that where, sweetie?

Just downstairs, honey.

You can't miss it.

You, Odessa James, I could've loved.

I could've loved you forever.

Will they catch you?

[Odessa] No.

Then go, go now.

Run.

They're coming.

(Suspenseful music)

Jenny.

Jenny, how long?

They're right outside, Mom.

They're here, they're here!

Bob?

Who the fuck is Bob?

(Suspenseful music)

Mr. Ryan, I'm United
States Marshal Lorna McCoy.

Mr. Ryan?

We're here to help you,
can you tell me where--

The boys.

You must be looking for the boys.

Odessa seems to have taken quite a liking

towards my wife, Rea.

They hit it off.

She seems pleased.

That's important, you know,
a marriage needs pleasing.

Mr. Ryan, can you tell me where he is?

Is he still in the house?

Sure, he's right upstairs.

I can smell his cigarette.

Nasty habit.

Kyle on the other hand, well,
his hunger overcame him.

He's in the pantry.

A limited selection to be sure.

Nevertheless, that's
where he can be found.

(Insects chirping)

Exteriors.

[Man On Radio] Nothing.

Shitters.

[Man On Radio] Nothing.

(Dramatic music)

(gun fires)

(insects chirping)
(suspenseful music)

Back in 'Nam, with boys like you,

I used to come in their ass for breakfast.

Those were good times.

Did you ever have
one of those days, Odi,

which eventually turns into this night,

which makes you stop and ask
the very question of why?

This little piggie went to the market.

This little piggie went to the store.

But these five piggies
here, well they went down.


The silent freedom of hostility.

The chambering of another
thoughtless round.

(Gun clicks)

You wanna fuck me, Odessa?

Goddamn piece of shit,
take it in the ass liking

son of a bitch, come fuck me, Odessa!

(Gun clicking)

Uh-oh.

I think we may have a runner.

(Gun fires)

(dramatic music)

Hi!

(Gun firing)

[Charles] Odessa James.

(Gun clicking)

Hi Odessa.

(Lighter clicks)

(suspenseful music)

Where have you brought me, girl?


(gun firing)

(guns firing)

(gun firing)

(glass breaks)


[Kyle] What the fuck are you doing?

What, what?

No!


We speak of god, that path he trod,

and of that righteous
day he toyed with clay.

Joseph Paul Kretzen.

Murdered, Alcatraz Island, 1946.

Lorna McCoy.

Damn you, Odessa James.

Goddamn you.

You know I have to kill you.

And you know you have to die, you know it.

[Odessa] Not today.

Jenny, don't you think it's
a little early for Halloween?

Oh, I don't know.

Sorta gives the whole situation a kind of

biblical ending, if you ask me.

Odessa and that lady, the policewoman.

Marshal, honey, she was
a United States Marshal.

She's alive.

Really?

Must be losing my touch.

Uh-huh.

She's in the underworld with Mr. James.

I saw 'em smoking a cigarette together.

Jennifer Lynn, is there something

you might like to share with this family,

like maybe of you helping Mr. James?

Like I'm really sure, Dad.

Did he or did he not like rip
up my Adam West signature?

Yes, of course, I'd forgotten.

Bob's still with Kyle.

Anything from Bob?

No news is good news.

Yes, well he does need the company.

(Door opens)

(gun clicks)

(gun firing)



Another storm is expected by midweek.

It says right here, another
three to four inches is coming.

Well.

Guess it's safe to say,
so much for the drought

in California.

Honey, would you hand
me one of those cookies?

One of those funny looking ones there

with the sprinkles on top?

Or a ladyfinger?

No, I think not.

That's a little too
heavy for after dinner.

I'll stick with the cookie.

Thank you.

Mm.

Mm.

(Light music)




(mysterious music)

You're a pain in the ass.

Pain in my ass, you are.

What?

What?

(Gun clicks)

What's there?

(Suspenseful music)

[Narrator] America's favorite killers,

Odessa and Kyle James, could
be yours to bring home.

â™ª James boys, James boys â™ª

â™ª Looking for love in
all the wrong places â™ª

â™ª James boys, James boys â™ª

â™ª Killing folks with the skull faces â™ª

You could teach Dad a lesson.

This is for raping me, Dad.

This is for violating me, Mom.

Blow Dad away with his removable head!

â™ª James boys, James boys â™ª

â™ª Looking for love in
all the wrong places â™ª

â™ª James boys, James boys â™ª

â™ª Killing folks with the skull faces â™ª

â™ª James boys â™ª

James boys, parents and
accessories sold separately.

[Jenny] Daddy, I think Bob is having

some troubles with Kyle.

I just heard him release a plaintive wail,

just a hop, skip, and a
jump from a second ago.

(Cheerful music)

Your brother.

Odessa.

He's left you, Kyle.

And I liked him.

Lord knows my wife approved.

I just opened the door,
off and away he went.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Now, about Bob.

He's explained it to me,
and I think I understand.

And I could also understand
how you might think

he's a little bit different.

But he really is a very sweet fellow.

And you may not be able
to tell by looking at him,

but he is one hell of a lover.


Let's get to the point.

You've been pushing
away from his advances.

Kyle.

Now what's up with that?

Hmm?

Look at me, Kyle.

Look at me, Kyle.

Fuck Bob, Charles.

I'm gonna get out of here with absolutely

no explanation at all,
because I also understand

and feel that it's going to come simple.

Now as for my brother, and
the theory of off and away,

you're right, he's not coming back for me,

and do you know why, you fuck?

Because he never left.

You see, that's the difference between

being a James and a fuck like a Ryan.

Now Charles, my brother and
I are going to kill you,

your cunt wife, your bitch daughters,

and last but not least, the beheading

of dear good old Bob.


Yeah?

Yeah.


(dramatic music)

(guns firing)

(mysterious music)

Rea.

I want you so much.

Let me have you, let me
make love to you right now,

what do you say?

Charles, not now, maybe later.

Okay?

Did you like it?

Did you like getting fucked by that kid?

Yeah.

Did you come?

God, yes.

Would you have fucked him again?

Yeah.

But you were gonna
kill him, honey bunny.

And I would've, but I
would've fucked him first.

Kyle James.

What a pussy.

Odessa Lee, what a coward.

What are you doing?

I'm saying my prayers, honey.

Nations raged, but thy wrath came.

The time for the dead to be judged.

For rewarding thy servants,
the prophets and saints,

and those who fear thy
name, both small and great.

For destroying the destroyers of Earth.

Amen.

Amen.

You going back to sleep, honey?

Mm-hmm.

Why don't you go see Jami?

She's probably still awake.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'll go climb in with Jami.

See you in the morning.

Odessa?

You regret me?

You were the only one who gave me hope.

You're gonna be okay, right?

I loved you, Odessa.

Like a mother.

If I was yours I would've.

See you soon.

Right?

Kill 'em all.

(Mysterious music)

God damn, eh?

You know, I wanted the colonial
house, and you said no.

And so then I wanted the adobe,

and you said nothing Spanish.

And instead, you picked the only house

with a fucking dungeon.

It's a lovely home though,
don't get me wrong.


(lighter clicks)

(suspenseful music)

Do you wanna kill her or do you want me?

(Jenny laughing)

Where did she go, nobody knows.

Brother James, I think it's
time we show the Ryan family

just who the fuck death is.

(Guns clicking)

(mysterious music)

(guns fire)

(intense rock music)
(guns firing)

(thunder crashing)

The fuck did they get those guns?

It wasn't like Bob gave
'em the goddamn weapons.

Maybe it was Bob?

Yeah.


Yeah.


I think it's time to show
those pussy James brothers

just what it means to be a Ryan.

Yeah.

Damn, I'm feeling good.

Woo!

(Wind blowing)

(suspenseful music)

Let's see.

What do you think, M16?

That's my girl.

I'm so proud of you.

And honey, I don't know, what
do you think, that outfit?

I think basic black.

Shotgun.

Yeah.

I got just what you need right here.

(Dramatic music)

(guns firing)

Damn.

(Rea laughs)

Jesus H. Christ, I feel for this country.

It's no wonder the conviction rate

fucking sucks in this country.

Sending me these pussies here.

(Gun fires)

Do a man's job by trying to kill me.

Me!

God damn, don't these people
know who the fuck I am?!

Would you like some
meatloaf for dinner, love?

Yeah, that sounds great.

Don't they know not to fuck with me?

To fuck with my family?

(Gun firing)

Fuck 'em!

(Gun firing)

Where are those James brothers?

They still killing those dwellers?


Maybe they have some balls after all.

Maybe they're ready to
dance with the devil.

(Gun clicks)

You know, with all these sparks flying,

kinda reminds me of our honeymoon.

Yeah?

Yeah.

(Suspenseful music)

(guns firing)

[Soldier] That's a gun.

Listen, I can just leave.


I can just leave you
guys alone if, oh shit.

(Guns firing)

(gun clicks)

[Rea] Motherfucker!

(Guns firing)

Sweetie.

Kyle James.

I'm curious.

When you put your dick inside of me,

how long was it there before I noticed?

You're a shitty fuck, Kyle.

A real goddamn disappointment.

(Gun firing)

Daddy's much better.

(Gun firing)


Stupid fuck!

Odessa Lee James.

One of the most notorious of all killers

to ever walk the row.

You know, look at me!

You were my fucking hero!

Can I ask you, lover, while you feel

this moment's for a smile?

An ending of painless peace for a boy

who longed to see death.

How about showing me a wee bit

of some sort of fucking disappointment.

Why?

Why?

Because I'm about to blow
your goddamn head off.


You know Rea, I just
thought of something

really fucking funny.

And what's that?

You.

Dead.

(Gun fires)

Ever had one of those days, Rea?

(Gun firing)

(guns firing)

Am I meant to say, in my humble way,

if another is right or wrong?

Or am I to judge with never a budge

if another is weak or strong?

God.

He came down through the
ages to write a small code,

in that mode he created for
his brothers iron cages.

Sat himself on a throne, that he alone

might judge the deeds of others.

Through his greed, and wanton need,

created the sins of his brothers.

Said he, with a sneer, I am here,

and this is the rightful code.

Before me you stand, why, at hand,

it's you who must bear the load.

How long the lout can stand and shout

of god and noble things.

Can turn it around and knock to the ground

the man who laughs or sings.

As a child, Odessa, I too had a dream.

Be strong in the lord, and
in the power of his might.

Put on the whole armor of
god, that ye might be able

to stand against the wild, the devil.

I'll see you in hell, Odessa Lee James.

Hell, Charlie, is gonna be
like a family fucking reunion.

(Suspenseful music)

(gun firing)


(siren wailing)

(thunder rumbling)

Fuck.

(Guns firing)

(cheerful music)
