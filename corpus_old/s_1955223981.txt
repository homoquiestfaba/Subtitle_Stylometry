[ Cards Fluttering ]

I'm 28.

Yesterday, I was 15.

The day before that, I was 30.

The day before that, I was 8.

One day, recently,
i was past 90.

Every day, I wake up
at a different age

in a different year
on a different day of my life,

and it's scaring the hell
out of me.

I want it to stop.

I need help.

I been awake for
the last 48 hours

trying to get someone like you
to talk to me

because I don't know where
I'm gonna be once I fall asleep.

Can you help me?

Have you ever heard
of this before?

Anywhere?

Let me get this straight.

You're reliving days
from your past

and living days
from your future?

Is that what you think?

You're assuming
that this is the present.

I... I don't know that.

This is just where I am today.

I remember nothing
before all of this started.

These days,
they are all new to me.

They're all I know about myself,

except... I know who I am.

I know who people are.

Things look and feel familiar.

I know what I think and feel.

Like, right now,
I'd really love to ask you

to lean forward a bit.

Excuse me?

If I could just...

[ Yelps ]

Sorry. Sorry.

Just bugging me.

Looks better that way.

Do you use any substances
aside from caffeine?

None...

That I know of.

When did this start?

I don't know.

Time's kind of relative
right now.

Well, what's the first thing
you remember?

[ Wind Whistling Faintly ]

The first thing you remember
is being 90?

92, actually.

How did you know your age
so specifically?

I don't know.

I just knew.

You didn't stay awake
very long.

I was 92. Give me a break.

Where were you next?

[ Throbbing Dance Music ]

â™ª â™ª

This is recently, then?

This hasn't happened yet,
actually.

This is two years from now
when I'm 30.

â™ª â™ª

Uh... okay. Okay.

Sorry about that. Okay.

Oh, you look so nice.

You have no memory of
the first part of this wedding?

None.

Any memory at this point

of having photographed
other weddings?

Nope.

So how did you know

what you were supposed to do?

How did you know
you were even the photographer?

I don't know.

I just knew.

Felt familiar.

I knew how to pose.

I knew their names.

Alison, can you lean forward
just a...

Knew how to use the light meter,

and the camera felt
like an old friend.

Ah, happy couple. Nice.

That's the second time
you fell asleep today.

Get it together, dude.

â™ª â™ª

Just darling, aren't they?

[ Laughter ]

You got any kids, honey?

No.

And you knew that because...

I just knew.

Well, don't lose heart,
my little friend,

because some day soon,
you're gonna meet a great girl,

and you'll have
a whole mess of kids.

You look like a fertile fella
to me.

I don't...

Want kids.

Shit.

Why did you say that?

I just know that I don't.

And then?

Of all the things
you could have done,

why did you pick up the camera?

I just wanted to.

[ Cat Meows ]

[ Ducks Quacking ]

[ Trolley Bell Ringing ]

I'm sorry. It's okay.

He's friendly.
Howard, come here.

No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

What?

Oh, that's super cool.

Can you just keep him there
for one second?

No, no!
You're still in the shot.

No, lower.

I can't go any farther
and still hold him.

Did you know that there are
116 different breeds of dogs?

No.

Howard's a beagle.

Howard, sit. Stay.

What's your name?

Lovell Milo.

And you just knew
your name somehow.

Now you're getting it.

Milo?

No, lovell.

Milo's my last name.

Sounded like you were saying
your last name first,

like they do at school.

I'm grace.

Want to take a picture of me?

No.

And then?

[ Phone Ringing ]

Hello?

What are you still doing home?

How old are you here?

-21.

Uh, who is this?

It's grace, dummy!

Are you still asleep?

Oh, what... do you know
what time it is?

I think the power is out.

Why?

Are you drunk?

I don't think so.

You have the biggest meeting
of your life today

with your hero, Steven Roberts.

He saw your work.
He's near town.

He asked you to coffee.

None of this rings a bell?

You're supposed to be there
in an hour,

and it takes an hour
to get there.

So I was a little freaked out

when I saw your car
still out front.

Oh, gosh. I'm outside.

I'm coming in. - Uh...

[ Knocking ]

And you just knew

you had taken all the pictures
on the wall?

Yeah.

You'd been busy
since you were eight years old.

Hi. Come on.

We're gonna drive you.

Nice underwear.

Howard, sit. Sit. Stay.

Go. You, go.

[ Sighs ] Boy...

So I had a date last night.
Oh, yeah?

Yeah, with that
really, really hot guy

that was hitting on me
at that gallery thing

we went to last week.

Yeah? How was that?

Fantastic.

Until he said, "yeah, I'm not
really that big into dogs."

And I said, "huh.
Well, check please."

Whoo!

Okay! Two minutes early!

I'll come back for you
in two hours.

All right.

Good luck, good luck,
good luck!

Hi, I'm here to meet,
uh, Steven Roberts?

Um, no one's here right now.

Did you want...
I can get you a table.

You can wait.

I'll just wait right here.
Okay.

[ Indistinct Conversation ]

Hey.

How'd it go?

Hi, folks. My name's Brian.

I'm the manager.

How is everything this evening?

It's good.
Okay.

Is there anything
i can get for you?

Uh, yeah, actually,
i have a question.

These, uh...

All this artwork on your walls,
is it by local artists?

Some local, some I just find
really interesting.

Oh.

How about th ese?

Would you be interested
in buying any of these?

They're by
my very modest friend here.

Um...

I like this one.

It might be really good
for your restaurant.

But...

I love... wait.

I like that one.

This is some
really great work, man.

How much do you want
for this one?

[ Laughter ]

Whoo!

That's the first photo
you've ever sold, isn't it?

Oh, wow. Yeah.

Be, like, your own...
Your own artwork.

Yeah. I think it is, but...

Yeah.

There's gonna be a lot more
where that came from, mister.

You're gonna be huge someday.

Are you tired now?

Lovell?

[ Yawns ] Oh, I'm falling...

I'm falling... I'm falling...

Doc, you got to give me
something here, okay?

You got any medications?
Oh, uh...

Oh, I need medication
or something here, doc,

so I can make it stop, okay?

Lovell, drink this.
Drink this.

Stay with me.

God damn it.

Uh, we're trying to do
the bouquet toss.

Is that okay with you?

Or, uh, you need a longer nap?

Hi.

Did you come see me
about two years ago?

For me, it was yesterday.

Milo lovell?

It's lovell Milo.

Sounded like you were saying
your last name first.

Please, god, let this work.

[ Whispers ] Dummy!

Pay attention.

Oh, this is never gonna stop.

[ Dramatic Instrumental Music ]

By the powers invested in me

by the wonderful state
of California,

I now pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. McNabb.

Pete, you may kiss your bride.

[ Applause ]

[ Camera Clicks ]

Make this stop.

Help me.

Please.

[ People Hooting And Hollering ]

[ Glass Clattering ]

I won't tell anyone
if you don't.

You can just put it down.

I hope they like the present
we got 'em.

I am sure they'll love it.

You don't even know
what it is.

Ah, it doesn't matter.

People love presents.

You don't.

What do you mean, I don't?

You don't like your present.

Well, I didn't get a present.

Yeah, you did,
but you don't like it.

I'm sorry, sweetie,

I don't know what
you're talking about.

You said you wanted it
to stop.

[ Haunting Music ]

What?

Somebody gave you a present,
dummy,

but you said
you wanted it to stop.

Do you know
what's happening to me?

And you're saying what's
happening to me is a present?

Mm-hmm.

What kind of sick,
twisted present is that?

From who?

Why?

It's the only way
you're gonna learn.

Learn? Learn what?

Someone's in trouble,

and you're the only one
who can save them.

Wha...

Who am I supposed to save?

Honey, stop bothering
this nice man

and come back
and finish your dinner.

Sorry. She's a little outgoing.

Just pay attention.

[ Whispers ]
Thanks for not telling on me.

Mental journal entry
number one.

It's time to pay attention,
to everything.

But since there's no use
writing things down

because I certainly
can't take it with me,

I'm just gonna have to
remember everything.

So here I am,

talking to myself.

Okay, all right,
what do I notice?

First, I seem to wake up
an awful lot

when I'm 30 or just before.

And about that time,
I've noticed this...

[ Moaning ]

Did you just fall asleep
on me?

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god. - Um...

You did not
just fall asleep on me!

Do you realize
how humiliating that is?

I seem to fall asleep
really easily

at this point in my life.

Narcolepsy is an inherited
sleep disorder,

an abnormal tendency to pass
directly from wakefulness

into dreaming sleep,

also characterized
by a loss of muscle control

when experiencing
intense emotion.

I find I tend
to fall asleep easiest

when something's not
stimulating.

[ Snoring ]

I used to do my makeup
in my car on the way to work.

Now I just... l meditate.

[ Snoring ]

That's one down.

Got a bizarre sleep disorder.

I also notice that I feel
exhausted all of the time.

The thought of doing
even the smallest things

like taking out the trash,
doing the laundry,

brushing my teeth, shaving,
showering,

picking out clothes

makes me feel like
going back to bed.

[ Camera Clicks ]

Wish the day would just end.

Dig the really cool watch,
though.

I'm hungry all of the time.

I'm not excited about anything.

[ Phone Rings ]

Sound of the phone
makes my skin crawl.

[ Doorbell Rings ]

Don't even get me started
on the doorbell.

I'm pregnant.

Do you want money?

I mean, if you can prove
it's mine, fine.

You know, I have... l can accept
when I've screwed up.

[ Scoffs ]

But I'm not gonna be
a part of this.

I don't want a kid.

Well, I can't argue with that.

Could you just lean a little...

In conclusion, I feel like shit.

And then I just want
to go back to sleep.

[ Lively Percussive Music ]

â™ª Hey-ey-ey-ey... â™ª

â™ª Ey-ey, ey-ey, ey-ey... â™ª

[ Motor Roaring ]

[ Tires Screeching, Glass Shattering ]

Oops.

[ Card Flutters ]

I've also noticed
I've been waking up

a lot lately around age 24.

And here, I feel fantastic.

I've got more energy
than I know what to do with,

and I love...

Stopping time,

making a moment live forever.

Can't get enough of it.

I'm working a couple
of different jobs,

and I am having a great time,

and it gives me time
to do what I love.

Oh, I don't feel like sleeping.

I'm having way too much fun.

My watch isn't quite as cool,
but I don't care.

And one day,
i wake up to this...

[ Birds Twittering ]

Morning, dummy.

[ Stammers ]

Hi.

Hi. [ Giggles ]

Hi.

You're trying to get me
to stay in bed.

[ Laughs ]

Running first,

then showering.

I know someone who's up.

Hi, guys!

Hi, baby. Let me get my shoe on.

Come here. Come here.

[ Glass Clinking ]

[ People Cheering ]

What are you doing?

Oh, my gosh.
I just got completely abandoned.

All you. All you.

Okay.

Um...

I am an only child,

as my folks well know,

as is lovell.

As a good friend once told me,

one of the advantages
of being an only child

is that you get to choose
your siblings.

And at a very young age,

lovell apparently decided
to choose me to be his sister.

[ Crowd Oohing ]

Which I did not want to be.
[ Chuckles ]

No, I...

I loved him from day one.

But he didn't get it,

so for years,
i waited and waited

for this old dog
to learn a new trick.

[ Laughter ]

I tried to forget him.

I went out with a whole parade
of other guys,

and I am so sorry, dad.

How could I forget?

But no one else compared.

No one else had a name

that sounded like
it was being said backward.

No one else saw the world
in such a beautiful way,

creating these amazing images

which have covered the walls
of my bedroom my entire life.

No one else got so much joy
from their work

and then kept going

no matter how hard anyone
tried to crush his spirit,

and no one else loved my dog
the way he did.

That's a big one, people.

No one else.

And I thought I lost him...

But then one day, somehow,

he found me.

You have always
taken care of me.

And I promise I will always
be there to take care of you.

No matter what,

you're not alone.

I... [ Laughs ]

I just want to see you happy.

I love you, dummy.

Come kiss me right now, please.

[ Cheers And Applause ]

I don't think
i could feel better.

[ Alarm Beeping ]

[ Beeping Stops ]

[ Buttons Beeping ]

You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

or is no longer in service.

If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

please check the number
and try your...

Hey, ma, it's me.

Are you there?

Uh, where, um...

Where's my wife?

[ Watch Beeping ]

God damn this thing.

Ma?

Mom, are you here?

[ Watch Beeping ]

Enough.

Hey, drew, Kathleen,
it's lovell calling.

I'm actually at your place.

I'm on your front lawn.

Just looking for your daughter.

You have reached a number

that has been disconnected
or is no longer...

Oh, come on.

[ Phone Beeps ]

Hi, honey. It's mom.

Strangest thing.

I found your watch
here in the house,

sitting on one of my tables.

I know how important
it is to you

since grace gave it to you
the day she died and...

[ Tires Screeching ]

I don't know how it got here,
but anyway, it's here, so...

I love you.

Buh-bye.

Someone's in trouble,

and you're the only one
who can save 'em.

Who am I supposed to save?

Just pay attention.

[ Breathing Raggedly ]

Hi, this is Shelly.

Leave a message.

Ma. Hey, ma, are you there?

Mom?

Mom!

Mom, are you here?

[ Watch Ticking ]

â™ª â™ª

Oh, goddamned small towns.

Would you just
get with the program?

[ Phone Buttons Beeping ]

Thank you for calling
the hall of records,

town of Riley creek.

No one is available
to take your call at th e...

â™ª â™ª

Sorry, sir, we're closed.

No, oh, no, no, no, no.

I just need five minutes
to locate...

Our business hours
are 10:00 A.M. to 5:00 pm.,

and it's 5:00 pm.

Why don't you get
a good night's sleep,

and we'll see you
in the morning?

No, no, no, sir.
That's not an option.

That's not an option
for me, sir.

Please, can you just listen
to me for one... [ Groans ]

Hey, drew and Kathleen,
it's lovell again.

Um, just call me
when you get this.

Hi, this is Shelly.

Leave a message.

Ma...

Please, you got to be there.

Damn it!

[ Knocking ]

Hello, lovell.

Hey, Mrs. z. Is grace here?

Oh, sure. She's in her room.

Thanks!
Oh, you're welcome.

Hey, Howard.

It's good to see you, bud.

[ Knocking ]

Grace.

Grace?

[ Clog Snuffling ]

Grace?

Boo!
[ Yelps ]

Were you surprised?

I'm the queen of surprises.

Howard, you're my baby.

Yes, you are.

Sit.

Stay.

What?

I think you should go
to the doctor.

Why?

It's always good
to get a checkup,

just in case something
might be wrong.

You never know.

What do you think
about Christopher king?

I think he's a jerk.

I think he's cute.

No, you don't.

I was kind of thinking
about asking him to go out.

No, you weren't.

Are you jealous?
Look!

I'm serious.

I think you should go
to the doctor,

just to make sure.

Fine, take me to see him
if it's so important to you.

Him?

There are only, like,
four doctors in this town.

Who else would you take me
to see?

[ Phone Ringing ]

Hi, hon.

You here to see your dad?

Yeah.

He's with a patient right now.

You want to wait in his office?

[ Trolley Bell Ringing ]

How come he doesn't have
any pictures of you?

Give me two weeks
to practice up

so I can kick your butt
on three.

Oh, you just wait, doc.

You're gonna wish you'd made me
worse, not better.

Well, the hippocratic oath
forbids that,

but that don't mean squat
on the golf course.

Thanks again, doc.
You're the best.

It's good you can admit
that now.

You just keep saying that.

What are you doing in here?

"- I was just wondering"

missy, excuse me.

This is not a toy.

I don't come to your room
and start going...

Picking up your valuables, do I?

No.
No.

You can extend to me
the same courtesy.

Now, what do you need?

I was wondering if you could
maybe take a look at grace.

See if she's okay.

What's wrong with you?

Nothing.

I just thought it would be
good if she'd get a checkup.

Um, grace?

Would you adjourn
to the waiting room, please?

This is not a playground

to which you can bring
your friends.

All right? This is my office.

I don't do parlor tricks here;
I work here.

And if her parents want her
to get a checkup,

they'll set it up and pay me.

I'm not a charity service
for you to abuse.

I know, but...
Hey!

Don't interrupt me.

Do you want to talk,
or do you want to learn?

I want to learn.

You don't bring someone to me
without an appointment

unless they are dying.

Clear?

Yes, sir.

Now, what do you have
to say to me?

Sorry, dad.

Okay.

Go home, hmm?

Do your schoolwork.

What good this is...
Being ten.

This is useless.

Being ten's not useless, hon.

Pay attention.

You're not here by mistake,
dummy.

How does grace die?

Just pay attention.

[ Whispering ] Grace?

[ Camera Shutter Snaps ]

[ Flash Whines ]

Lovell.

You want me to take it away?

Put the camera down, sweetie.

We're having dinner.

[ Snoring ]

[ Clears Throat ] Orson?

[ Snoring Deeply ]

[ Giggles ]

Orson?

Orson?

Lovell... lovell, no.

[ Camera Shutter Snaps ]

[ Flash Whining ]

Did you just take my picture?

[ Snorting ]

Why?

Did you just take my picture?

What if I did?

Give me the camera.

Why?

Lovell, please just do
as your father asks.

So...

You think it's funny
to make fun of me?

No!

I had pictures of grace
on there!

Lovell, your father asked you

not to take pictures
at the table.

He didn't have to
ruin my film.

Asshole.

Kay.

You will not be seeing
this thing again

until you are old enough
to vote.

No!

I saved up for that! It's mine!

Lovell! Lovell!

Maybe now you'll spend
more time on your homework

instead of taking
so many stupid pictures.

Lovell, let go.
Let go of me!

Honey...

You okay?

I told you to let go of me.

Come on.

Let me get you a tissue, okay?

I'm never gonna be like him.

Never.

His pictures aren't stupid.

Excuse me?

I don't know
if you've taken the time

to look at his pictures

or if you're capable
of appreciating them,

but he's really good.

He could really be something.

Get out of my house.

Grace.

Come on.

Let's go.

[ Subdued Jazz Music ]

â™ª â™ª

[ Doorbell Rings ]

Are you Mrs. Milo?

Tell me, what are you gonna
sell me next?

Things I want? One of those...

Hi, something I can do
for you gentlemen?

Orson Milo?

I'm Dr. Milo.

I'm Mr. koehler.

I'm Mr. Brazil.

Department of social services.

We had a domestic violence
claim filed against you, sir.

Is there a private place
we can chat?

You know it was
just an accident, right, lovell?

Never beat up my son.

That's absurd.

That little girl
was a guest in our home,

and she pulls this?

[ Clattering ]

You are never to speak to her
again-ever.

[ Breathing Heavily ]

God, I could kill that kid.

[ Snoring ]

Orson!

[ Tires Screeching ]

This has gone on long enough.

You have a problem.

Shell, be intelligent
about this.

I can't just medicate myself.

Every last bit
of pharmaceuticals

has to be accounted for.

It's illegal, number one.

Number two, I go to another
doctor to get diagnosed;

people talk.

It'd be all over town
that doc Milo's got a problem.

Mental journal entry
number two.

I think my father's involved
in graces death.

I haven't seen a day past
26 years old in a long time.

And all I've been seeing lately
is him...

Or the lack of him.

So if I'm not here by mistake

and this is important...

Then he's involved.

So be careful
and ready for anything.

[ Thunder Crashes ]

Happy birthday, dummy.

I have to hit the head.

[ Thunder Rumbling ]

[ Ticking ]

Grace gave it to you
the day she died.

[ Ticking ]

Oh, no fair peeking, mister.

Not until tonight.

[ Silverware Clinking ]

26 years.

Doesn't seem possible.

It seems like just yesterday
he was 8.

Actually,
that was two days ago.

It seems like just last week,
he was born.

I miss having a baby around.

Well, how about it?

You two got a grandchild
in the works for me?

[ Clears Throat ]

What?

You are never going to be
more fertile

than you are right now.

Orson!

You know,
some people don't find

that line of questioning

particularly polite
or considerate.

Oh, that's right.

You're a pretty tough cookie.

Probably don't want kids
to mess with your independence.

Dad, stop it.

You know what?
You don't know shit.

And it's none of your business.

You think you can talk to me
like that in my own home?

Orson!

I said years ago she wasn't
allowed in this house,

but I had to go back on that
because you married her.

But I'll be damned if I let her
curse at me under my own roof.

Jesus Christ, Orson.
She has endometriosis.

They just tried in vitro,
and it failed.

Okay?

She's devastated.

They probably can't have kids.

Happy now?

[ Door Slams ]

Grace!

Grace!

Grace!

Hi, this is grace.

Surprise me!

[ Knocking ]

Hi.

Christ!

Does she belong to you?
Yes.

God... grace, are you okay?

Bath room, please.

Yeah, it... it's this way.

I tend bar at Luka's tavern.

I found her
in one of my back booths,

and this was the address
on the driver's license.

Okay.

I got it. I got... me...

Yah! - All right.

[ Gags ]

Wait, wait, wait.

Come in.

Thank you so much.

You're so nice.

Isn't she, like, the nicest...

[ Heaves ]

She gonna be okay?

I mean, how much did she
actually drink over there?

I didn't serve her, so I'm
not sure how much she drank.

Keep an eye on her,

but I'm sure
she's gonna be fine.

I'm a pretty good judge
of that kind of thing by now,

yeah.

Ah, listen,
thank you again, um...

What is your name again?

Linda.
Linda.

I'm lovell, and that's grace.

Grace.
[ Muttering ]

She just, um...

I don't know why I am...
I just...

[ Coughing And Sputtering ]

I should get going.

Yeah. Thank you again.

Where did you get these?

Uh, I took 'em.

Get out. They're fantastic.

Thank you. Thanks.

Do you sell 'em?

Not to someone
who takes my wife home,

but you're more than welcome
to have one on the house.

Which one?

That one.

Luka's tavern, right?

Top of Hannah road?

Yup.

I'll drop one off.

Thank you.

Thank you.

[ Muttering ]

Tell grace.
Yes.

Oh, there's a bag out here.

Happy birth day.

Thanks.

[ Thump ]

Oh!

Grace?

[ Sighs ] Okay, okay.

Now leave mommy alone.

Leave her alone. Hang on.

Did you see the girl?

She's really, really nice.
Yeah.

And she's really pretty.

Mm-hmm. Let me see you.

Messy.

And I bet...
I bet she can have kids.

Wh... why don't you go marry her?

Just go... you go make lots
and lots of babies with her.

Go ahead and make 'em.

Grace.

'Cause... 'Cause she's pretty
and nice, and she...

I'm fine with it.

I'm fine with it,

'cause I have baby...
Where are my babies?

Grace.
[ Sobs ]

Grace, look at me.

Hey. Come here.

Look at me.

[ Crying ]

I love you.

I don't want anyone else,

no matter what.

I'm so sorry, dummy.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

You've got nothing
to be sorry about.

[ Vomits ]

Except maybe that.

[ Phone Ringing ]

[ Crying ]
Hello?

[ Sobbing ]
Hello?

Lovell?

Grace?

Grace, where are you?

What's going on?

[ Crying ]

Thank you.

You're such a good friend,
lovell.

All right, baby. Look at me.

It'll be okay.

Okay, I'm right here.

[ Clog Whines ]

Shh, baby.

Grace.

Are you ready?

Right here.

[ Dog Whimpers ]

[ Sniffs ] You're not alone, okay?

I'm right here.

You're not alone.

[ Bawling ] Oh, my god.

Nobody's in there...

[ Sobbing ]

I wonder what he saw at the end.

I've heard people who've had
near-death experiences

say that when you're close
to death,

your life flashes
before your eyes.

<i>He was 16.</i>

Oh, that doesn't seem like much.

In dog years, that's,
you know, 100-something.

I mean, that's a hell of a life.

Yeah.

I wonder what he saw.

He saw you.

He's lucky.

If I was gonna die,

I can't think of anyone else
I'd rather see.

[ Grunts ]

I love you.

I love you too.

[ Cries ]

I've loved you since
i was eight years old.

That's a long time.

[ Laughing ] You're shaking.

Yeah, I'm so scared.

Me too.

What... what are you...

Stay right there.

I don't ever want
to forget this.

No!
Yeah, yeah.

Grace, come on.

Gosh, I look...

Like hell, I'm sure.

Just lean forward
a little bit.

Right there.

[ Camera Shutter Snaps ]

Did you get it?

Merry Christmas, dummy!

Do you like it?

Santa put it on your wrist
while you were sleeping.

Very sneaky.

It's gorgeous.

Well, I am the queen
of surprises.

[ Giggles ]

Now, you better get up, mister,

'cause we have a big day today.

[ Watch Ticking ]

You all set? - Yeah.

Yeah.

I got it. I got it.

Okay.

I'll drive! I'll drive.

Okay.

Why are you driving so slow?

Well, people drive drunk
on holidays.

You got to be careful.

It's a boxful of money.

You totally wrapped this.

Yes, he totally did.

[ Watch Beeping ]

Sorry, sorry, sorry!

It goes off every hour
unless you...

I wish you'd quit fooling
with that thing.

I'm not even supposed
to be here right now.

You couldn't get someone else

to cover for you at Christmas
for a change?

No, all the other m.D.S

are out of town
for the holidays.

I'm the only one holding
down the fort at the hospital.

I was able to sneak away
because it's been dead all day.

But I have a responsibility,

and I have to keep an eye on it.

Maybe you don't understand...

Well, if you're gonna be here,

I'd appreciate it
if you kept an eye on us too.

Open... open it!

Okay, let's see.

It's a... you are clever.

Gotcha! A big box.

Oh, I love the colors.
Thank you.

Orson, did you see this?

[ Snoring ]

[ Shouting ]

You have no interest
in what goes on in this family.

You never have!

You want to talk.
You don't want to learn.

Talk? Answer my question!

I am not going over
this shit again.

I am done!

Ma, we can do those for you.

Oh...

Mom...
I'm fine.

Why don't you two just...
Just go home.

[ Sighs ]

Well...

Yeah.

Yeah, I need to blow off
some steam.

Let's go jogging. Come on.

Uh, grace.

Why don't we just call it
a night?

Come on, come on!
[ Murmuring ]

[ Giggles ]

Come on!

Oh, no, you don't!

Oh!

[ Dogs Panting ]

Uh-uh. Hey.

Whoo.

Am I alive?

Do you know...

That they used to tell time
by the stars?

It's where they got
the calendar.

[ Dogs Growling ]

Hey, guys! Boys, sit!

Sit.

Stay.

Stay.

I bet...

That you can't catch me.

[ Laughing ]

Come on, boys. Come on!

Come on! Come!

Come on, guys!

Uh-oh. No, no, no, bosch.

Not in the street.

[ Screams ]

[ Clock Ticking ]

Oh, my god!

Oh, no!

No, no, no, no, no, no!

Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god, no.

Oh, god, no. No, no, no, no.

She was running...
The middle of the road...

[ Snoring ]

Grace, grace. Oh, god, no, no.

No, no. Come on.

Come here, come here, come here.

You need to call someone.
You need to call someone.

Come on, baby, no.

I'm so sorry.
Please, grace.

[ Siren Wailing ]

Take a look at my finger,
sweetheart.

Focus on this, will you?

Okay. All right.

Hey, did you get ahold
of that doctor yet?

[ Pager Beeping ]

[ Snoring ]

[ Beeping Continues ]

26-year-old female jogger.
N.D.A.

Possible severe head trauma.

Mom? Mom, where's dad?

Get ahold of that doctor yet?

Ma, they can't find dad.

[ Pager Beeping ]

[ Snores ]

Systolic pressure 60
and dropping.

It's at 50.

She's going into attack.

She's going into v-fib.

Charge the monitor.

We're gonna shock her. - Christ!

Can we get a doctor
in here, please?

Orson!

[ Pager Beeping ]

[ Snoring ]

[ Murmurs ]

[ Sobbing ] Oh, god, no.

Oh, hi, Shelly.

[ Crying ]

What's wrong?

[ Sobbing ]

I am so sorry for your loss.

[ Sobs ]

Where were you?

[ Shouting ] Where were you?

Out for a walk.

I didn't get the page.

The goddamned pager
must be broken.

[ Cell Phone Buttons Clicking ]

[ Pager Beeping ]

Oh, my god.

You son of a bitch!

Oh, my god.

Lovell.
She was hit by a car, lovell.

She was hit by a car.

She smacked her head
into the pavement.

It's doubtful there's anything
anybody could have done.

There was a chance!

There was a chance!

You fell asleep,

and now she's dead.

Oh, my god, dad.

My grace is...

I did everything I ccu...

Get off!

[ Growling ]

[ Sobbing ]

[ Glass Shatters ]

[ Sniffling ]

[ Crying ]

Lovell.

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Don't ever speak to me again.

I can't... I can't go to work.

When I take one look
at her bed...

[ Sobs ]

I'm never gonna have kids.

Never.

And I'm never gonna be like him.

Mental journal entry
number three.

I failed.

She's gone.

All this learning
because I was the only one

who could save someone
was useless.

Maybe I'm crazy.

It's not useless, lovell.

It's not over.

Pay attention, dummy.

Pay attention?

Up yours.

I am crazy.

[ Machine Beeps ]

Hi, honey, it's mom.

I just thought I'd check
and see how you're doing.

Haven't talked to you
in a while.

I'm at the office today.

I miss you.

I love you.

Bye.

[ Thunder Rumbling ]

[ Siren Wailing In The Distance ]

Just a second, honey.

What are you doing here?

I don't... I don't know, uh...

You can't just show up.

That's not okay.

He knows who you are.

You said you didn't want
any part of this.

So be consistent.

Send the checks
and live your life.

That arrangements worked fine.

[ Solemn Orchestral Music ]

â™ª â™ª

Yo, Kevin.

Kevin!

Yo, Kevin!

Oh, hey. What's up?

How you doin', bro?
Good, man.

<i>- Good seem' you, man.</i>

Kevin.

Can anybody name me
one of the major themes

in catcher in the rye?

Yeah, Kevin?

Uh, loss of innocence.

Loss of innocence.
That's great.

Can you tell us more about that

in terms of the
title of the story?

He views the world of adults
as phony,

and there's a lot of resistance
to growing up.

Yeah, there is. There is.

So everybody remembers
the passage, right?

Where Holden is actually on
the cliff, and...

Yes?

Um, hi.

I don't mean to bother you.

This an okay time?

What can I help you with?

Well, uh...

I'm Kevin's father.

He was in the class
that just let out.

Oh, yeah?

I can tell. You look like him.

Guess I do, don't I?

He's a good student.

Is he?

Oh, room for improvement,

but who doesn't have that?

Always says please.
"Yes, please."

A lot of kids don't do that.

Suppose credit for that
goes to you.

Ah, it's more his ma, really.

Props to the better half.
Good man.

What can I do for you?

Well, I was just wondering,

um, from your...

From your position
as his teacher, you know...

How is he?

Is he happy?

Is he happy...

Well, well, have a seat.

You know, I see him
with a few friends.

Not a lot, but the ones he has
seem pretty solid.

I haven't seen him
with a girlfriend yet.

Think he's still
a little awkward around 'em.

Yeah, he lights up
when he talks about animals.

That's for sure.

Seems hell-bent on being a vet,

as I'm sure you know.

And he is always singing
or humming something.

That's a sign of happiness,
so they say.

I assume you're going
to his concert tonight.

[ Swelling Choral Music ]

[ All Singing In Foreign Language ]

â™ª â™ª

Hi.

Um, it's okay. It's okay.

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

That was great.

It was a really beautiful
concert.

Could hear you
every once in a while

when you really sang out
over everyone else.

Got a great voice.

You, uh, play the piano
great too.

Really...

Very talented.

So I guess you know who I am.

It's okay.

I... I know I haven't, uh...
I haven't been around,

been a part of your life.

The reason is...

You might not understand this,

but I was just scared
to know you.

Afraid to, uh...

Afraid to fall in love with you,

and then what if something
were to happen to you?

Does that make sense?
It's just easier to...

What the hell
are you doing here?

Just talking to my son.

Your son? Excuse me.

Did I just hear you say
your son?

Come on, honey.

You got to earn
the right to say that.

Maybe I can take you to school
once in a while,

you know, or dinner...

No. How dare you?

How dare you just show up
on his big night

and blindside him like this?

I'm sorry, honey.

Maybe you could just think
about it, and...

Don't take a step closer
to him,

or this is gonna get ugly.

Honey, calm down.
Okay, I'm gonna give him...

Know what?
I'm gonna count to three.

Calm down.
One.

Don't touch me.
Two.

Scott, let's just go.
Just leave me alone.

Three.

[ Moaning And Clattering ]

Stay away from my son,

or you're gonna get worse.

[ Wheezing ]

[ Thunder Crackling ]

[ Metal Clanging ]

Please,

whoever you are,

I screwed up.

Just give me another chance.

Oh, please.

Please, just give me
another chance.

Hey, dummy.

<i>- Sweetheart.</i>

What's happening?

Right now, you're in the middle
of this accident.

You're 30.

This is where it started.

This is where it ends.

See, it's true.

When you're near death,

your life flashes
before your eyes.

I set this up.

And I've been with you
the whole time.

All of them?

They were all you?

But...

You're dead.

I've been dead for four years,
lovell.

But you said that this was
so that I would learn.

Someone was in trouble,

and I was the only one
that could save them.

That's right.

But not me.

Then who?

You.

I couldn't stand to see

what happened to you
after I died.

I wanted to remind you
who you were

and show you
where you were headed.

I promised I'd always
watch out for you.

I want to see you happy, dummy.

Didn't see this coming, did you?

I am queen of surprises.

But you're dead.

That's not fair.

Why?

It's just the way it goes.

We've all just got to do
our best.

It's not going to be easy.

Your heart's gonna break again.

It looks like
you learned something.

What you do, it's your choice.

I just... l wanted to remind you

you're not alone.

Stay.

Is there something
we can do here with June

to warm it up a bit?

You mean... yeah.

You know, we can... l can
bring the reds up a little.

Can you?
Yeah.

I think that would do it.

All right, Randy.
Well, we did it again.

Looks even better
than the last year.

Great.

Steven, it's great
to finally meet you.

Sorry about the meeting.

Ah, it was 15 years ago.

Water under the bridge.

Tony, Hazel. How are you guys?

[ Trolley Bell Ringing ]

â™ª â™ª

Hey, Kevin.

How's bugs today?

Not hungry.

Don't know what's wrong
with him.

Trying to figure it out. - Yeah?

Well, if anyone
can figure it out, it's you.

Hey, when's your mom
coming to pick you up?

Not till tomorrow.

Oh, good.

You can have dinner
with us again.

Not if you're having
broccoli again.

Hello, Paula. Hello.

How's my sweet one?

How have you been treating
mom my today, baby?

She's been exhausting mommy,
is what she's been doing.

She has been? Whoa.

Hi, mommy. - Hey

I'm gonna take Paula
to gymboree.

We'll be back in a bit.

Okay. That sounds good.

<i>- Wake up, sweetheart.</i>

You know you forgot
to take your medication today.

You know, I remembered
halfway through the day.

I worry about you driving,
honey.

You've already had one accident.

Linda, my dear,
you are so right.

I promise I will take it
straightaway.

That enough food?

Dad, you're not supposed
to feed fish more than that

or else they'll get sick.

I know, buddy.

I was just, uh...

I was just testing you.

Hey, fishie, fishie.

Come back, fishie.

You think I can get
a really huge fish?

What kind of fish do you want?

Mm, a whale.

[ Glass Shattering ]

Oh, Christ.

Kevin!

Kevin's gonna be okay.

He needed some stitches,

and he's got
a pretty bad bruise,

but the doctor was able
to stop the bleeding in time,

so he's gonna be okay.

We recommend that he stay
for at least the next day.

Hey.

How you doing, bud?

Okay, I guess.

My head hurts.

Yeah. Yeah, it would, yeah.

Are my fishies okay?

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Linda's taking care of 'em.

She put 'em in a bowl.

They have to be in water.

They are.
They're in a bowl with water.

We're gonna get you
a much better tank,

tons better
than the old one, okay?

I was worried
about my fishies.

Yeah.

Kevin,

I am so, so sorry that
i didn't take my medication.

That is not fair to you,

and I don't know
if you can forgive me,

and I'll understand
if you don't,

but I am truly sorry.

It's okay, dad.

Just don't do it again.

I won't.

Excuse me, ma'am?

Is there any way I can speak
to the doctor

that worked on my son?

I just really want
to say thank you.

Absolutely. Right this way.

He's with a patient right now,

but you can just wait
by his office.

Great.
Right here.

Thank you.

[ Exhales Sharply ]

[ Melancholy Orchestral Music ]

â™ª â™ª

So you met Kevin.

Yeah.

Strong kid.

Brave.

Yeah.

Maybe you could come over
some time,

talk to him some more...

Meet my wife, Linda,

and your granddaughter,

Paula.

That'd be nice.

Yeah, now your turn.

Huh? Yeah, up.

[ Speaking Indistinctly ]

Everybody ready?
Yeah.

Okay, let me put your... oh!

[ Camera Beeping ]

Picture, picture!

Look at the camera!

Dad, dad, dad, right here.

Everyone look at the camera.

Look at the camera, Paula.

[ Camera Shutter Snaps ]

The first thing
you remember is being 90?

92, actually.

your life flashes
