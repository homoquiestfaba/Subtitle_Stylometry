Marine, what're you waiting for?

[man screams]

No, please, don't!

[gun firing]

All right, move, move, move!

[suspenseful music]

[man sighs]

[whimsical music]

All right, Mags, car is
packed.

Time for your mother
and me to hit the road.

Come on, dear, let's go.

She can handle it, right, Mags?

Love ya, kiddo.

See you in a few days.

Make sure the wolves don't
kill each other, okay?

[suspenseful music]

[footsteps approaching]

[suspenseful music]

[birds chirping]

[suspenseful music]

Just another day in paradise.

Don't worry, sir, we'll find
him.

[suspenseful music]

Follow me.

Yes, sir.

[suspenseful music]

Please, shut the door.

Yes, sir.

[suspenseful music]

[door thuds]

Hey look, Connor, I'm just
gonna get right after it.

I got a call this morning
from Sarah Simmons

over there on Ridge road.

Sarah Simmons, Bobby's wife?

Yeah, Bobby didn't come home
last night.

She's worried sick about him.

Now, you know it takes
about 24 hours for us

to generate a missing person's
report.

I think with everything
going on around here,

I need for you to get out there
ASAP

if we have any chance
of finding him alive.

Yes, sir, me and Dave
will get right on it.

Hang on, there's more.

I need you to take care of
Dave while he's out there.

Sir?

Now, Dave and Bobby were
old high school buddies.

I know my son.

This might shake him up a bit.

Yes, sir, anything you need.

Now I know Dave can
be kind of an asshole,

but you're doing a real good job

of taking him under your wing.

He doesn't have to know
everything

while he's out there,
understand?

Yes, sir.

[suspenseful music]

[car door thuds]

We have to get you a better
watch.

Why, I have a phone.

Nevermind, did you at
least check in this morning?

Oh, my God, no.

Hold up, it's fine.

I got you, it's fine.

All right, so what're we doing
today?

[suspenseful music]

I know this guy.

Are you gonna be all
right to handle this?

Yes, I'll be fine, damn.

Look he's out there.

They're all out there.

We'll find them.

I do have a serious question
though.

Shoot.

Before we get started,
can we please get a coffee?

You gotta be kidding me,
right?

[car engine roaring]

[whimsical music]

[object thudding]

[footsteps approaching]

[wolves howling]

Come on, buddy, come on.

That a boy, let's go, come on.

Come on, let's go,
buddy, come on, let's go!

[mysterious music]

[wolves growling]

Hey, hey, hey, come on, whoa,
whoa!

[mysterious music]

[car engine humming]

[mysterious music]

How are they doing today?

Hungry as usual, very active.

I hung their breakfast so
they would work for it,

but they'd rather be hunting.


Wolves will be wolves.

How are we doing on meat?

Um, we're okay with the red
meat.

Little light on the chicken.

Probably could use a
little bit more rabbit.

Oh, yeah, sure.

[pencil scratching]

Anything else?

Yeah, see if you can check
into getting a mammoth for us.

That should last us about a
month or two.

Good idea [sighs].

Stop it, Todd.


You're gonna wear yourself out.

Your parents enjoyed doing this
job.

That's what you gotta do.

You know what?

What?

It's been a whole year
since they've been gone.

I kinda had a feeling today
was gonna be a rough day.

Well, I finally had the
courage

to start going through
some of their things.

You know, your parents,
they were good people.

Dad was a genius.

He knew so much about wolves,

what they needed and when.

How to take care of them.

It was like he was part of the
pack.

There's lots to live up to.

Give it time.

That's easy for you to say.

This burden hasn't passed on to
you.

Hey, you're not in this alone,
okay?

I was there for your parents.

I'll be there for you.

I know, Todd, thank you.

that, seriously, you're family.

Oh, that actually reminds me.

When I was going through Dad's
things,

I finally got myself to look in
the bag

that they found at the scene
that night.

They gave you that stuff?
I thought that was evidence?

No, they let me have it.

Anyway, it's over there with
some of my dad's old stuff

if you want anything.

Anything good in there?

Just his camera and some
hunting gear.

Oh, actually, there was
something interesting,

this old book.

A book, what kind of book?

old.

I mean hard to say really.

I don't know.

I didn't read it yet.

Why trouble yourself with that
stuff?

It's a waste of time.

Geez, Todd, who needs to
lighten up now?

I'm sorry, Mags.

I'm just concerned about the
wolves

and what were going through now.

Can I show you something
out in the feeding pen?

Yeah, sure.

expensive.

[suspenseful music]

Look, I know this case may
be a little bit rough on you.

Man, I'm fine, seriously.

Okay, the Chief is really
worried

about you digging in on this
one.

Yeah, telling you all this
stuff

while keeping me in the dark?

Dude, he doesn't have
any confidence in me.

Man, he's just a father
trying to protect his kid.

All right, he's trying to
protect everybody in this town.

We need to cut the guy a
little slack, don't you think?

If you say so, man.

Come on, Dave.

I know he has high expectations
of you, but for good reason.

Dude, the only reason I'm
involved in any of this stuff

is because I'm your partner.

I'm just here for the ride.

Come on, you bring a lot to
the table.

Like what?

Okay, Bobby, you and
him were friends, right?

Right.

Where would he be going?

What would he be doing?

You mean besides drinking?

Yes, Dave, besides drinking.

I don't know.

I know he liked to fish.

Fishing, well, there you go.

Did a little detective work.

If he liked to fish,

he'd have to pass by Frank's
to pick up supplies, right?

Let's go by there and see
if Frank seen anything.

[suspenseful music]

[door thuds]
[bell rings]

Hey, how's it going there,
Frank?

Oh, hey, Connor.

What can I do for ya?

Frank, we got a call this
morning.

Oh, was it about all
those folks going crazy

and buying up all my inventory?

I mean look at that.

They bought up all the toilet
paper.

Of all the things you'd think.

No, Frank, it wasn't
about your toilet paper.

I mean, that is weird though.

Tell me about it.

Frank, we're looking for Bobby
Simmons.

We have reason to believe

that he might've been by here
yesterday

buying some fishing supplies.

Have you seen him?

Bobby Simmons, no, I can't
say that I have, sorry.

Are you sure?

I keep an eye on everybody
that comes in this place, okay?

You never know if one
of those little fuckers

might be that killer that's on
the loose.

You know what I'm saying?

Frank, come on, there's no
killer, okay?

Just a few missing people,
that's all.

I suppose Bobby's the next on
that list?

Didn't say that either, Frank.

I don't know.

I've never seen people so
scared,

and they're buying up all this
stuff,

and locking themselves in their
houses.

That's just not right.

Frank, we're gonna
get to the bottom of it.

You know, hearing you say
that,

doesn't fill me with
one iota of confidence

that this situation is gonna
get taken care of anytime soon.

All right, Frank, let's calm
down.

We have people working around
the clock on this, all right?

[door thuds]
[bell rings]

Can I help you, miss?

I'm looking for my
husband, Bobby Simmons.

Thought he might've stopped in
here.

Well, I'll be.

So are these fine gentlemen
right here.

Hi, Sarah, I'm Detective Ryan.

You may know my partner, Dave.

Yeah, I know Dave.

[Frank groans]

What's going on?

We were actually on
our way to come see you.

Okay.

[Frank groans]

Hey, Frank, can you give us a
sec?

Sure, go ahead, help yourself.

It's not like you don't have
an office about six doors down

where you can conduct your
business.

Sarah, we were assigned

to your husband's case this
morning.

I don't understand.

They told me it had to
be at least 24 hours

before anyone could do
anything, what's wrong?

Well, that's usually
the case, all right,

but as you know, Dave and Bobby

were good friends in high
school,

and he wanted to get a jump on
this one.

Hey.

Hello.

What can you tell us, Sarah,
that might help us find him?

Where would he be going?

What would he be doing?

His sorry ass is probably

passed out drunk somewhere in
the mud.

sound like the Bobby I knew.

This one time we found him
passed out on the floor of the...

Now let's calm down here.

Take a deep breath.

What can you tell us, Sarah?

He might be the town drunk,

but he's a good man, a good man.

Yes, nobody said anything
differently.

What happened last night?

I already told the guy
on the phone earlier.

I understand, ma'am,

but it would really help me
if I could hear it again.

[suspenseful music]

I,

well, we kinda got into a little
argument,

but then he stormed off in his
truck,

and said he needed to blow off
some steam.

Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

What made you think to look for
him here?

Well, if he's not out
drinking at the fuckin' bar,

he's usually fishing.

Okay, Sarah, that helps a lot.

All right, there's only
a few spots on that river

he can get to at night.

Won't you just go on home.

Me and Dave will go around
there and take a look.

If we find anything,
we'll give you a call.

Does that sound good?

Yeah, good idea.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

[bell rings]
[door thuds]

[suspenseful music]

Oh, shit, there's Bobby's
truck.

[suspenseful music]

Oh, my God, that stinks.

What is that?

[suspenseful music]

Oh, Jesus, nasty!

[mouse squeaking]

Yeah, he's not there either.

[mouse squeaking]

Let's go down this way.

Yeah, let's do that.

[mouse squeaking]

[suspenseful music]

All right, listen.

There's two trails.

You're gonna go down that way.

I'm gonna go down this way.

All right.

[suspenseful music]

Oh, shit, Connor, Connor,
Connor, Connor!

Son of a bitch.

What is that?

[suspenseful music]

Christ, dude, he's been torn
apart!

Easy, calm down.

Assess the situation.

What's missing here?

His leg!

Yeah, Dave, I know his leg,
but look.

There's no flies, maggots,
nothing.

Maggots, what does that
have to do with anything?

Bobby's truck, they were full
of them.

Look at this, there's nothing.

This kill is just a few hours
old.

And this, does that look
like a coyote print to you?

No, dude, that would
be a big ass coyote!

Hey, Dave, do you remember
that girl last summer.

You mean the wolf girl?

Yeah, Dave, the wolf girl.

I think we should call
her and get her up here.

Oh, Jesus.

Are you okay?

No, dude, before we had

just a bunch of missing person
reports.

I figured eventually they
would just turn back up,

and now we have this,

and you're talking about wolves?

Calm the fuck down!

This is the job you signed up
for!

Now, do me a favor!

Go back there and call Dr.
Keely!

Dr. Keely?

The fuckin' coroner, Dave!

Okay!

Okay.

[Maggie sighs]

Shit.

[Maggie scoffs]

[suspenseful music]

[phone ringing]

Maggie Talbot.

Miss Talbot, this is Detective
Ryan

at Mantua Police Department.

Connor?

You remember?

What can I do for you?

Maggie, it seems that we
have another animal attack.

And you're calling me?

You must think it's a wolf.

I don't know to be honest with
you.

There's a lot about this
case I don't understand.

I could really use your
insight on this one.

Well, wolves haven't
been seen in the wild

in this part of the country for
decades.

I'll leave out the details for
now,

but it's pretty violent.

Okay, you know wolves are
highly misunderstood creatures,

and very rarely attack
humans, I mean [chuckles].

Yes, ma'am, I understand,

but there's really something
off about this one.

You could have coywolves.

What's a coywolf?

It's a crossbreed between
a coyote and a wolf.

You know wolves have been known
to cross with other species.

That can actually happen?

Yeah, of course.

I mean I'd have to see the
evidence to know for sure, but.

Well, listen, this
is out of my skill set.

Are you available to come take a
look?

Sure [chuckles].

How soon could you get here?

Um, not long.

I just have to pack a few
things and I'll be on my way.

Sounds good, thank you.

[Maggie chuckles]

[suspenseful music]


[suspenseful music]

[car door thuds]

Hold it, hold up!

What's going on?
The police down in Mantua

think that someone was attacked
by a wolf.

A wolf in that area, bullshit.

That's what the man said.

You want me to come with you?

No, it's probably just a
coyote,

but just in case I'm gonna check
it out.

I should come with you, hold
on.

Let me get a few things, all
right?

No, no, Todd, don't worry
about it.

I got this.

You stay here with the wolves.

Don't go chasing that legend.

Legend, what're you talking
about?

Nothing, just be careful.

In fact, take this.

Come on, I don't need a gun.

No, seriously, please, take
it.

Fine.

[gun clicks]

I'll be back in a day or two,
okay?

[car engine humming]

[suspenseful music]

Oh, man.

[papers rustling]

[camera shutter clicking]

[suspenseful music]

Hey, Connor!

[camera shutter clicking]

What the fuck is wrong with
you?

camera, man.

You could be one of
those outdoorsy models.

You know what?

One minute you're pissing your
pants.

Next you're a fuckin' paparazzi.

I swear you have multi
personalities.

[suspenseful music]

[object thuds]

[engine roaring]

[truck horn blowing]

[suspenseful music]

[light piano music]

[car door thuds]

[haunting choral music]

[knocking on door]

[haunting choral music]

[door creaking]

I knew it.

I'm so sorry.

[Sarah crying]

[haunting choral music]

Check this out.

Scandal.

I know, right?

What do you think they're
saying?

Something messy, that's for
sure.

Definitely, and she's all
like,

"You have to leave before my
loser husband comes home."

Yeah, and he's like,
"You're totally right, babe.

"That dude totally sucks."

"We can't keep doing this.

"It's just [sighs], too much."

"Fine, if you want it that
way,

"I'll take this fine ass
somewhere else."

[both giggle]

Oh, shit, I think he heard us.

Relax, can't hear us from
all the way over there.

Ah, could he?

[both chuckle]

Fuck, he did.

That dude has incredible
hearing.

And an incredible ass.

Oh, please, he's so out of our
league.

Speak for yourself, sister.

Look, look, watch.

[both chuckle]

Damn.

[suspenseful music]

[door thuds]

[suspenseful music]

Can I help you, miss?

Yes, I'm here to see Detective
Ryan.

He's expecting me.

And who should I say is here?

Maggie Talbot.

Okay, ah, just take a seat,
Miss Talbot.

He'll be out in just a few
moments.

You have a Maggie Talbot here to
see you.

Miss Talbot.

Please call me Maggie.

Of course, thank you for
coming by.

Come on back.

So Maggie how is it you
have so much knowledge

in this field?

I mean, to be completely honest
with you,

a lot of people thought
you were crazy last year

looking for wolves in Ohio.

in the family business.

My parents raised me in this
life.

So they help you with this?

Ah, not anymore, no.

Off the better things, I
guess.

Ah, not exactly.

Last year, we lost on an
expedition in Alaska, so.

Oh, Maggie, I...

No, I mean, it's not your
fault.

They were actually up there

looking for wolf pack territory
patterns

when they both went missing.

I am so sorry, really.

It seems like you have a lot
of resilience carrying on.

Well, the conservation
center's

what keeps their legacy alive
for me.

Of course, I understand.

Well, I don't wanna take
up too much of your time,

but here's some of the tufts of
hair

that we found around the body.

The body?

I didn't mention it?

No, you said there was an
animal attack.

You thought it was wolves.

Well, technically you said
wolves.

Semantics, I think we're
getting off track here.

Yeah, you're right.

Is there anything else to show
me here?

Yes, actually I found
some interesting remains.

This doesn't make any sense.

Wolves don't really attack
people.

Not to mention they've all been
eradicated

from the lower 48.

It's just hard to believe a
pack large enough to do this

would go undetected.

[suspenseful music]

Am I interrupting anything?

Maggie, I think you
know my partner, Dave.

Yeah, of course.

Nice to see you again.

Likewise, so what do
you make of all this?

I'm not sure yet.

I mean, I have to see
more evidence of wolves

to make a determination.

Dave, did you process
the photos of Bobby yet?

take her

to go see the body in person,
can't you?

That's a good idea.

Would you be up to that, Maggie?

Sure.

I think I'll stay here and
finish processing the evidence.

I'll drive.

[suspenseful music]

Oh, hello, Connor.

Hi, Dr. Keely.

This is Maggie Talbot
from the Wolf sanctuary.

Oh, yes, nice to meet you,
Maggie.

Forgive me for not shaking your
hand.

Oh, no problem.

Well, since we're all
here, brace yourself.

It's not pretty.

[suspenseful music]

You can clearly see the teeth
marks here,

but not on the leg where you
might expect.

It's more of a tear than a bite
here.

Are you okay, Maggie?

[clears throat] Yeah, I'm
fine.

There's just something
really strange about this.

It looks like a straight kill.

What do you mean straight
kill?

I was thinking the same thing.

What she's saying is that it
doesn't look

as though anything was
consumed, not much anyway.

It's obvious this animal
didn't kill for food.

I mean this type of aggression

could be a possible territorial
issue.

Like protecting a den of pups?

I mean that's possible, but
unlikely.

It still would've consumed the
meat.

There's a lot here that
doesn't make sense yet.

We still have a lot more
investigating to do.

Have you had a chance to
check out the other remains yet?

Not yet, I kind of got my
hands full with this one.

Of course, ma'am.

I'll let you know as soon
as I find anything new.

Thanks, Doc, appreciate it.

[suspenseful music]

Skee, Skee, damn it, Skee, no!

God damn, Skee, look at me!

Skee, look at me!

Hold on, hold on!

Don't, Skee, God, no!

No!

Ryan, your pickup is ready
at the pharmacy counter.

Ryan, the pharmacy counter.

[suspenseful music]

Maggie, you should know

that people have gone missing
around here.

We have this case.

Really it's all these cases
and it's got me stumped.

And until today, I thought all
these cases were unrelated.

Wait, so Bobby isn't the
only one you're working on?

Really, it's not safe around
here.

You know, we should go get your
car,

and I'll follow you to the
hotel,

and we'll just pick this
back up in the morning.

[suspenseful music]

[knocking on door]

You got a second, Chief?

Yeah, come on in.

Need to give my eyes a rest
from these reports anyhow.

Anything new to report?

I mean, yeah.

I just got a bad feeling about
all this.

[suspenseful music]

â™ª Well, hey, hey, hum â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, ho â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, hum â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, ho â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, hum â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, ho â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, hum â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, hum â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, hum â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, ho â™ª

â™ª Well, hey, hey, hum â™ª

[phone ringing]

Hey there, boss.

Hey, find any wolves?

Well, we found something,

although I don't think it's
wolves.

Coyotes then, just like you
thought.

Not unless a coyote can
tear the legs off a man.

Wait a minute.

What did you say?

They found a body out
here that was torn apart.

It's got slashes and teeth
marks,

but nothing like I've ever seen,
Todd.

Hold up, are you safe?

Yeah, Todd, I'm fine.

Have you heard of anything like
this?

Listen, Maggie, stay where you
are.

Don't go out.

I'm on my way to you.

Wait, what aren't you telling
me?

I'll explain when I get there.

Just stay safe.

I'll call when I'm close.

[suspenseful music]

So, if what you're telling me
is true,

we have a killer on the loose.

Well, yeah, we have
to tell people, right?

Have you looked around
when you've been out there?

People are already hiding
scared.

Last thing we wanna do is
create any sort of panic.

[knocking on door]

Yea, come on in, Connor.

What do you think of all this?

To be honest, sir, I'm not
sure,

but I do know we don't need
people

walking on the streets at night.

Seems to be when all the action
happens.

Hmm, that's a good idea.

Maybe we need to issue a
temporary curfew.

Yes, sir.

I think I'll give a mayor
call.

I just said that.

[suspenseful music]

[leaves rustling]
[man gasping]

[suspenseful music]

[leaves rustling]
[man gasping]

[suspenseful music]

Call Detective Ryan.

[phone ringing]

Dr. Keely, what've you got?

Some information for you
on those skeletal remains.

I'm listening.

We ran some tests,

and determined that some
of the bones were broken.

Based on how you found them,

this would indicate a heavy
impact or a blunt trauma.

That's not good.

Exactly, but that's not all.

We found multiple stress
fractures on the skull.

How could that have happened?

Well, the fracture patterns
indicate

equal pressure from
both sides of the skull.

Perhaps the vic's head
was squeezed or crushed.

Oh, shit, any more on the
ID's?

The lab reports indicate the
DNA

is consistent with the
first missing person.

So, it's related?

I'm still waiting on reports

of the second set for
confirmation.

Okay, thanks, Doc.

Hey, Connor, wait.

Yeah.

Be careful out there.

I've never seen anything like
this before.

Right.

[suspenseful music]

[engine roaring]

[suspenseful music]

Did you have trouble finding
the place?

You know me, Mags.

I can track anything down,
especially you.

Let's just get to it.

What aren't you telling me,
Todd?

[suspenseful music]

What'd you bring that for?

I promised your dad,
I wouldn't get you involved in this,

and now I gotta break that
promise, Mag.

Involved with what?

Look, I lied to you earlier.

I know exactly what this
is and what it's all about.

This is your dad's hunting guide
of sort.

All his information, what
he's done, et cetera.

What are you talking about?

He was a hunter,

and he hunted werewolves.

you having a stroke?

I mean, what do you mean
werewolves,

like shape-shifting, eat your
livestock

in the middle of the night
werewolves, I mean [chuckles]?

[suspenseful music]

No, no, no, no, no, that
can't be true [chuckles].

This, this can't be true.

It is, all of it is.

and Dad went missing,

they were hunting werewolves.

Yes, I, I had a vision.

I told your dad, don't go on
this.

I've got a bad feeling,

but he insisted on wanting to
go.

He says, stay back, take care of
Mags

in case something happens to us
and I did.

[suspenseful music]

Are they dead?

I don't, I don't know.

I, I don't know, Mags, I
honestly don't.


[suspenseful music]

Tell me everything you
know, and start with that.

Okay, I will.

Wolves haven't been seen in
the wild

in this part of the country for
decades.

Wolves are highly misunderstood
creatures,

and very rarely attack humans.

[suspenseful music]

It's obvious this animal
didn't kill for food.

There's just something really
strange

about this type of aggression.

[suspenseful music]

This is really tough to
translate.

We realize the languages
here aren't all the same.

Some go back centuries, even
more,

from all over the world.

Most from which we don't have
record of.

So, whoever assembled this
must have been a hunter.

As long as werewolves have
been around,

there've been people hunting
them.

You sound like you're on
the side of the werewolves.

You have to understand
werewolves are people too.

They are literally tortured
with this condition.

It's not their fault they're
like this.

They've experienced great
trauma and they're cursed.

We only kill werewolves if
we have to to protect others.

Well, the people of this town

need protecting from
what's out there, Todd.

Look here, we know the
werewolves emerge at night,

but during the day they're
human,

and almost always
demonstrates these symptoms.

[suspenseful music]

Have you encountered anyone here

in this town with these
descriptions?

No, but Connor might know
something.

[suspenseful music]

[phone ringing]

I got it.

Ryan.

Connor, it's Maggie.

I got something here you need to
see.

You're still at the hotel,
right?

Yeah.

Okay, give me an hour or so.

I'm just finishing up at
around here, hang tight.

[suspenseful music]

[car door thuds]

[suspenseful music]

Hey, Connor, thanks for
coming.

Of course.

This is my friend,
Todd, from the sanctuary.

Nice to meet you.

Likewise, please have a seat.

[suspenseful music]

So, Connor, I noticed on my way
in,

the town's pretty dead, nobody
around?

Yeah, well, empty street
make my job a lot easier.

I bet.

observant.

I bet.

[Maggie clears throat]

So ah, what've we got here?

Do you wanna tell him, or
should I?

[suspenseful music]

Tell me what?

[suspenseful music]

[Maggie sighs]

[suspenseful music]

[woman shouting]
[suspenseful music]

Ugh, whatever, Karen!

[door slams]

[Jeremy sighs]

[lighter clicks]

I see a little bit of
a carcass or something.

A carcass?

Yeah.

I fuckin' told you.

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Get me out of here.

Why, more lame suburban crime?

No, dude, my mom is
driving me fucking crazy.

I need to go out.

What are you doing later?

[TV buzzing]

We interrupt this program
for a special report.

Hold on.

[suspenseful music]

We're asking all the residents

to stay off the streets tonight.

We will be issuing a curfew
just as a precaution.

Jer, are you watching
the news right now?

Ah, ew, no.

Our main objective is
to keep everyone safe.

Please just stay calm
and comply to this order.

Well, apparently we're
not doing anything later.

The Chief has ordered us
to stay off the streets,

and we have some sort of curfew
now.

It's not a problem.

We'll just go to our spot in the
woods.

See, I follow rules, no streets.

You're so clever.

I know, grab Jessica
and meet me there later.

Okay, whatever.

Follow these orders,

and that is how we will all stay
safe.

Thank you for your cooperation,

and we will plan to
keep the public informed

of any new developments as they
arise.

[suspenseful music]

[door creaks]

[suspenseful music]

Jesus, this is a lot to take
in.

Hmm.

And you believe this.

Honestly, I do.

I mean everything I
saw, everything I know,

it just points to this being
real.

guess I have no choice

but to believe it too,

even though I don't want to.

Then you and I need to get out
there

and hunt this thing down

before it kills somebody else,
okay.

Wait, like now?

That's not a good idea.

Look, I've been doing
this for a while now.

We need to hunt this thing down
tonight.

That's not safe.

Trust me, I'll meet up

with you guys tomorrow morning,
okay?

No, you're not going out there
alone.

Maggie's right, we
should wait till morning.

Okay, first light, all right?

Come dawn, we break.

So we're in agreement.

Don't you stick around here
tonight.

Agreed, right, Todd?

Right, all right, well,
I'll be back in the morning.

[Maggie sighs]

I think we need to watch
yourselves around him.

Who, Connor, why?

I don't know.

There's something about him and
I can't put my finger on it.

Well, come on.

Let's find you a room in
this place, I'm exhausted.

[suspenseful music]

[creature growling]

[man screaming]

[suspenseful music]

[man screaming]

[chains rattling]

[man screaming]

[suspenseful music]

Hey, Chief, you working late?

Yeah, and the work's never
done.

Come on in.

So anything new?

No Connor's out on
a couple of leads now,

and I've been going through
these crime scene photos

trying to figure out if there's
something

we possibly could have missed.

Divide and conquer.

Something like that.

[both chuckle]

You look fried, Dad.

Didn't Connor tell you to
call me Chief around here?

Right, but I'm talking as your
son now.

You can't help anybody like
this.

Yeah, maybe you're right.

So much for easing out of
this job and into retirement.

Stop, that's what quitters
say.

You raised me better than that,
right?

I mean, don't get me wrong.

There's a lot going on

for an old guy like you to try
to conquer.

You're still a sharpshooter,

and it's what this town needs
right now.

Hmm.

Well, I'll drink to that.

That's what I'm talking about.

[suspenseful music]

[leaves rustling]
[suspenseful music]

Boo!

[girls laughing]

You fucking asshole!

Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

Are you okay?

No.

Way to go, Jer!

You jumped out in front of
me. What was I supposed to do?

Hey, there's only one thing
that'll make this better.

What?
What?

Never come to a party
empty handed [laughing]!

Seriously, Amanda?

Oh, relax, Jer.

Come on, let's go.


[girls laughing]

[liquid pouring]

Do you remember that one
summer

when we sent you away for camp?

Not really, why?

Well, I don't think your
mom and I ever told you this.

We sent you away because we
wanted you

to have some structure in your
life.

And you were a pretty big
asshole

when you were a little kid

never change, right?


we thought we had it all figured
out.

Send you away for a couple of
weeks.

Enjoy the peace and quiet.

Thought everything would turn
out great.

And did it?

No, no, Dave, it didn't.

You see, ah, we thought
we had it all figured out,

but your little brother,

he was destroyed when you
weren't there.


He would just sit, look
out the window for hours

just waiting for you to come
home.

We'd tell him,

"Go on out, go play,
have some fun, be a kid."

He wouldn't do it.

He just sat there waiting for
you.

I know the bond between
brothers can be special.

It was like you two were
connected,

because when you weren't
there, part of him was missing.

Why are you telling me this?

[suspenseful music]

You know, it's not easy for
me to admit that I'm wrong.

Dad, it was just camp.

I'm not talking about camp.

You know, parents do all
sorts of strange things

to ah, protect their kids,

and I've been keeping
things from you around here.

I've been doing it for your own
good.

Like what?

Well, nothing major, but
ah, some little things.

But those little things
can add up to big things,

especially for the cases
that we're working on.

I guess what I'm trying to say
is

time for me to take off
the training wheels,

because I can't protect you
forever.

I think I just need to
get out of your way,

and let you do your job.

[suspenseful music]

I've never heard you
talk like this before.


I had no idea you had it in you.

used to it,

because tomorrow I'm never
gonna be wrong again.

[glasses clink]

[Chief exhales deeply]

[Chief chuckles]

Ugh, guys, I just don't
understand

why we are being punished
with this curfew.

Like, it's our civil right to go
out.

This is an injustice.

That's exactly what this is.

You know I don't drink.


Yeah, don't be such a puss,
Jer.

Give me that.

Bitches, please, I have my
vices.

They just happen to be
different than yours.

[girls laughs]

You mean trashier than ours.

[girls laughing]

The irony, my sweet tart.

[girls laughs loudly]

Jess, help me up, bitches!

[girls laughing loudly]

Guys, shut up for a second.

No, you shut it.

No, guys, seriously, shut the
fuck up!

I think I just saw
something move behind you.

[suspenseful music]

What?

[twig snaps]

[suspenseful music]

[creature growling]

[suspenseful music]

Do you see anything?

Guys, what it is?

[suspenseful music]

[creature growling]

[suspenseful music]

[creature growling]

[Jeremy gasping]

[suspenseful music]

[knocking on door]

Come on!

[knocking on door]

Come on, come on, where is
everybody?

[suspenseful music]

[creature growling]

No!

[creature growling]
[Jeremy grunting]

[suspenseful music]

[fabric rustling]

[metal clanging]

[fabric rustling]

[metal clanging]

[leaves rustling]
[suspenseful music]

Dad?

Maggie, go back.

[fabric rustling]

[suspenseful music]

No, I'm, I'm not gonna leave
you.

Maggie, go!

[creature growling]

Oh, oh, Dad!

[suspenseful music]

[Maggie gasping]

[suspenseful music]

[Maggie gasps]

[suspenseful music]

Todd!

[knocking on door]

Todd, wake up, it's Maggie!

[knocking on door]

I'm up.

I need to show you
something. Look at these shots.

What does that mean?

Where did you get this?
That's Dad's camera?

I found the card hidden in the
book.

Look, why does my father have
a picture of Connor in Alaska?

Is it possible?

What, what do you mean?

Well, the last time I
talked with your father,

he was tracking a lead on a
werewolf.

He was suspicious of a young man
in town.

Good looking kid, had
a scar on his shoulder.

Connor's always rubbing his
shoulder like he injured it.

I thought there was something
about him.

So, what do we do?

Look, Maggie, I promised
your father I'd keep you safe,

so we aren't going to do
anything tonight.

[Maggie sighs]

Stay in your room, lock the
door,

and don't go anywhere, okay?

Todd, he might know about my
parents.

I can't just sit here and wait.

You have to.

I tried to warn your parents.

They didn't listen to me.

I'm not gonna let this happen
again.

Fine.

[suspenseful music]

[Maggie sighs]

[door thuds]

[suspenseful music]

[door thuds]

[suspenseful music]

[light piano music]

Look, Maggie, I promised
your father I'd keep you safe,

so we aren't gonna do anything
tonight.

[light piano music]

[Maggie sighs]

Oh, God.

[suspenseful music]

[light piano music]


[light piano music]

[suspenseful music]

You're not in this alone,
okay?

I was there for your parents.

I'll be there for you.

I know, Todd.

Don't mess with that, I mean
seriously, you're family.

[creature growling]
[suspenseful music]

[light piano music]

[Maggie sighs]

[suspenseful music]

Fuck this, I can't wait anymore.

[suspenseful music]

Todd, it's time to go!

[knocking on door]

Todd, get up!

[knocking on door]

Todd?

[suspenseful music]

Shit.

[suspenseful music]

Oh good, you're here.

Didn't you go home last night?

No, sir.

Well, get yourself together.

We've got another dead body in
town.

Shit.

Come on, we better get
going. I need you on the scene.

Where's your partner?

Don't know, sir.

All right, well, let's
go. I'll fill him in later.

[suspenseful music]

[car door thuds]

Hello, anyone here, hello?

[bell ringing]

Sorry, it's been crazy around
here.

How can I help?

I'm looking for Detective
Ryan.

He just left.

Can I leave a message?

Shit, no, no message.

Where did he go?

I'm sorry, I can't give
you that information.

Seriously?

I've been working with
him on this investigation.

What did you say your name
was?

Maggie, Maggie Talbot.

Please, I really need to talk
to him. This is important.

Okay, let me try.

10-100 to 10-04.

10-100 to 10-04.

[suspenseful music]

10-100 to 10-04.

10-100 to 10-04.

I'm sorry, he's not responding.


[suspenseful music]

[Maggie sighs]

[suspenseful music]

Where are you, Todd?

I had a vision.

I told your dad don't go on this
one.

I got a bad feeling.

Are they dead?

I don't know, Mags.

[suspenseful music]

Jesus Christ.

[suspenseful music]

[footsteps approaching]

Stop, sorry, ma'am.

You can't go any farther.

I need to find Detective Ryan,
please!

I'm sorry, you can't go any
farther.

This is really important.

He went that way.

[Maggie sighs]

[suspenseful music]

[leaves rustling]
[suspenseful music]

No, God, no, shit!

[suspenseful music]

You know the old man's
got bourbon in his office?

No, serious, me and him
had a moment last night.

[suspenseful music]

[footsteps approaching]

[suspenseful music]

Maggie, what are you doing
here?

[Maggie gasping]

[suspenseful music]

It was you all this time?

No, Maggie, no, it wasn't me.

[door thuds]

Jesus, you look like hell.

Where's my brother?

[suspenseful music]

Maggie, just relax.

Put the gun down!

Matt, relax, Connor went out
on a case.

He'll be back in just a little
bit.

Is there something I can help
you this?


You need to go get my dad.

[suspenseful music]

Maggie, whatever you're
thinking, it isn't true, okay?

You killed them [crying].

I know that it was you!

You took everything from
me [crying], my parents!

No, no, Maggie.

You can't just sit there
and lie to me [crying]!

Maggie, look, it's me, it's
Connor.

No [crying].

[knocking on door]

Chief, we need you.

Connor's brother's here.

Something's not right.

[suspenseful music]

Matt, what's going on?

[gun clicks]

Whoa, whoa, whoa, let him go
now!

[suspenseful music]

[Maggie crying]

Look, Maggie, I know
you're scared, okay,

but this isn't you.

You don't know anything!

You can't, it's just too much.

You're the strongest person I
know.

But you gotta think about
what you're doing here.

Drop your weapon.

I can't, it has to be this
way.

No, it doesn't!

You don't have to do this!

Yes, I do!

It's the only thing I can do!

Damn it, trust me!

I can help you!

It's too late for that!

It's too late for me, I've
tried!

[suspenseful music]

Everything I've done!

[man screaming]

Everywhere I've gone, it stays
with me!

[suspenseful music]

[creature growling]

It's better this way.

I beg of you, don't do this,
please.

[suspenseful music]

No!

[suspenseful music]

[creature growling]

[suspenseful music]


[light piano music]

I know there's a special
bond between brothers.

It's like you guys are
connected in some way.

It's okay, get up.

And part of him was missing
when you weren't there.


[light piano music]

It's okay, it's okay.

Everything's gonna be fine.

[Maggie crying]

[light piano music]

Family and friends,

we thank you for allowing us
this honor.

We, the members of this Honor
Guard assembled here today

didn't personally know Matt
Ryan,

but we do recognize him
as a comrade in arms.

Honor Guard, 10-hut, port
arms!

We understand his commitment
and service to his country

as a member of the Marines

during tours of duty in
Afghanistan.

Ready, aim, fire!

[guns firing]

We know the loneliness,
fatigue, boredom,

and terror of combat service.

Aim, fire!

[guns firing]

When the call of our country
was heard

Comrade Ryan answered.

Self was forgotten in the
cause of greater good.

Aim, fire!

[guns firing]

When someone you love is so
valued,

a memory is the byproduct.

That memory surely becomes a
treasure.

Let us now remember what this
soldier's life was and is.

On behalf of the
United States of America,

United States Marine Corps,
and a grateful nation,

we present this to you in behalf

of your sibling's great
honorable service to his country.

[light piano music]

[suspenseful music]

[Maggie chuckles]

[suspenseful music]

[phone ringing]

Connor [chuckles], hi, it's
been awhile.

Is everything all right?

[suspenseful music]

Wait, what?

[suspenseful music]

Copy that.
