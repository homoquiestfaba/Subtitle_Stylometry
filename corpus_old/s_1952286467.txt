This is the story of a legendary land...

in a dimension slightly askew
from our own, called "Ganache."

For thousands of years,
the monarchy of Ganache...

was controlled by the Kinka,
who had magic powers.

The Byoh, who practiced
the art of deception,

raised the flag of
rebellion against them...

and plotted to destroy
the royal house.

The bloody uprising
scorched the land.

And one by one, the sorcerers of the
Kinka fell to the swords of the Byoh.

When it was clear his
castle would soon fall,

King Mahtah, the leader of the Kinka,

entrusted the restoration of the royal
house to his newborn daughter.

He gave the princess
to a trusted retainer...

and ordered him to
escape from Ganache.

And no one knows what
became of the Kinka Princess,

who is said to possess
tremendous magical powers...

Magical Meow Meow Taruto

It's the perfect day for a move, isn't it?

This is everything, right?

Yes.

Okay, then we'll get going.

Iori, we're leaving.

Iori...

Meow 1
Beginning, Beginning

It's completely empty.

It looks like we only just missed them.

So, we're back to where we started.

We must find her, as soon as possible!

Isn't there anything fun to do?
Nani ka ii koto nai kana?

I ask the swaying wild flowers
Soyogu no no hana

The wind doesn't tell me anything
Kaze wa nani mo tsugezu

It just passes by
Tada sugite yuku

It's a riddle, and the answer is
Nazo nazo kotae wa

Beyond the sky
Sora no mukou ni

I saw this in a dream
Yume de mita koto aru

Let's try going down this road
Kono michi wo itte miyou yo

Surely, surely, my heart
Kitto kitto kodou ga

Surely, surely, will start beating faster
Kitto kitto to takanaru yo

Let's take today's flower and, yes, send it to tomorrow
Kyou no hana wo sou asu ni todokeyou

Little footsteps, one after another
Chiisa na ashioto kasanete

Sound out the rhythm of love
Ai no rizumu wo narasou

The joy of our having met
Futari deaeta yorokobi ga

Resounds through the sky
Sora ni hibiki hirogaru

This whole town is my new garden, meow!

I -- Iori...

IORI!!!

The whole town is her garden?

She has some nerve saying
that when she's new here.

Hey, shall we tease her a bit?

Ah, Mama.

Yeah, we're here. Are you
gonna be late again tonight?

Iori? Well, you know, he's
the same as he always is.

Iori! I've got Mama on the phone.
Do you want to talk to her?

Well, I'm rather in the middle
of something at the moment.

Can you just tell my older sister I said hello?

He says "hello."

Iori!

Listen, listen! There's a really
scary-looking house over there and...

Taruto, look at this. It's a
German-made potato masher.

Aren't German-made things nice?

Not that, meow!!

It's German-made!

Iori, what are you doing?
Help me straighten up in here!

Oh, Kinako. Shall we get some yams?

Huh?

We'll grow them here in the garden.
Yes, that's it! Let's get some yams!

Taruto, yams are very nice. You can
make all sorts of sweets out of them.

Sweets?

Wait a sec, it's fine if we
have yams or potatoes but--

Potatoes?

You'd rather have potatoes?

Potatoes are good as well,
but I recommend yams.

Basically, the climate here is
better suited for growing them.

The reason potatoes are grown in Europe...

is because they thrive in the
cooler climate you find there.

By the way, there are more yams
in the Orient than Europe is...

Oh, that's right! Did you know this?

Both the yam and the
potato were discovered...

-Iori! Bring this luggage up to the second floor!
-when Columbus went to the Americas...

-Iori! Bring this luggage up to the second floor!
-and were brought back to Europe at the same time.

-Geez! At this point I wouldn't mind getting a hand from the cat!
-Queen lsabella the First, who ruled Spain at that time,

-Geez! At this point I wouldn't mind getting a hand from the cat!
-apparently took a liking to them.

By the way, the yam is from
the morning glory family...

and the potato from the aubergine family.

-Iori, just leave it to me! I'll give her a hand, meow!
-They both produce starchy tuber roots underground.

The potato is called a Jaka potato in Japan...

because it was originally
imported by way of Jakarta,

which is now the capital of Indonesia.

Meow!

Taruto! What are you doing?!

For goodness sake, you've spilled stuff all over the place!

-What'd she do?
-For goodness sake, you've spilled stuff all over the place!

-I don't know...
-For goodness sake, you've spilled stuff all over the place!

Lemme go, meow! Iori, save me, meow!

Why did Iori take in this cat?!

Iori's whims can be a real pain!

You find about 100 grams
of starch in a potato...

Iori!

Iori! How long are you
going to keep that cat?!

Well, you see, I just used my
magic to try and help, meow!

I wasn't being naughty, meow!

Magic...?

There, there. I understand. I see, I see.

I guess I'll try to get some
shopping done before it gets dark.

Only Iori understands my feelings, meow!

You just wanted to play, right, Taruto?

But you mustn't be naughty, okay?

There you go!

That's not it! I was trying to
use magic to help, meow!

Is it that much fun? Here you go!

That's it!

Tail... That girl's...!

Chitose, don't trip out.

Iori...!

Huh? That's strange.
Suddenly, I feel so sleepy...

Taruto...

This is familiar somehow...

I'll see you later.

See you later, Darling.

Iori...

What?

Who's there, meow?

Maybe I'm imagining things...

A gho... A gho... A gho... A gho...

A GHOST!!!

Now then, shall we start the welcome party?

Tail... Tail...

Tail... Tail...

Hmpf! I wonder if there's anything to eat?

There probably isn't much, since
you're only just moving in, but...

Found some!

Don't be a thief!

Did you say "thief"?!

Those are the cakes...that Iori made...

Calling me a thief...
You'll ruin my reputation!

As we've lived in this city a long time,

we only came to give a newcomer
some much needed guidance.

Tail...

Um... Excuse me, um...

-It's wonderful...!
-Um... Excuse me, um...

Um... Excuse me, um...

What was that just now?

There is something in here.

I don't smell any mice but...

Do you have any unusual pets?

No, we don't, meow.

Then it must be burglars.

Maybe they're looking for food.

That would be you two, meow.

Or maybe... it's a monster,
coming to eat you!

Yes, yes. Her tail looks absolutely delicious.

Run for it!

While we can use her as a distraction!

It's with the utmost
reluctance I take my leave.

It was nice meeting you.

W-W-Wait!
I want to run away, too, meow!

I don't wanna get eaten, meow!

How'd you untie that knot?!

You don't give up easily, do you?

Iori!

Iori... wake up, Iori!
A monster is coming, meow!

Stay away!

Stay away!

How long will you stand
there shaking in fear?!

B- But, Ultra Mask, I...!

You're the only one who can fight them now!

If you don 't protect your
loved ones, who will?!

My loved ones...!

You have hidden powers inside you!
Now, take courage and fight!

That's right! I have hidden powers!

Transform! Matrix the Brave!

Perfect, meow!

Prepare yourself!

You won't escape, meow!

Heh-heh, Do you think
you can keep up with me?

Meow!

Meow...

How naive!

You fiend! It's cowardly
to attack from behind!

Take THIS!

Meow! Meow!
Meow, meow, meow!

Y- Your pretty tough, meow!

Farewell!

Come back here!

Wait!

Come out of there, meow!

It's... It's... It's... It's...

IT'S HERE!!!

Please don't eat me, meow...

Taruto, be strong!
You must be strong, meow!

Taruto, what have you been
fighting for until now, meow?

That's right.
I'm fighting to save Iori, meow.

Exactly, so take heart!

I'm not scared, meow!

I AM scared after all!

Please, don't eat me!

Huh...?

Who are you?

I- I'm Kakiemon, they call me Kakipi.

I won't taste good if you eat me!

A mirage?

Maybe we've been following
an illusion like that, as well.

Or it could just be an unfounded rumor.

We can't be certain of that.

Until we are, there is only
one path we can follow!

I see. You got trapped in there...

while you were hibernating
for the winter, meow.

Kakipi, come and visit
again sometime, meow.

S- Sure...

What's wrong, meow?

I can't fly. I haven't had anything
to eat or drink in a while.

I'm so hungry I can't fly.

I know! Magic is my specialty!

I'll use it to make you all sorts
of delicious foods to eat!

Magic? That's impossible!

Meow!

I wonder what she's doing?

Meow!

Appear! Yummy, yummy, yummy stuff!

I- I'll try again, meow.

Meow!

Meow!

Meow!

MEOW!

Don't worry about it! It's not like...

you're that legendary magical
princess or anything.

I'll do it, meow!

Yummy stuff! Yummy stuff!
Yummy stuff, meow!

LOOK OUT!

Incredible! Flying!
I'm flying!!

You might really be that princess after all!

Princess...?

No... No way, that girl...?!
It can't be...

Thank you!
I'll come back and visit!

I'm home.

Tomorrow will be a 30
degree Celsius summer day.

Who the heck are you?!

Me? I'm Taruto!

I'm Iori's fiancee, meow!

I sense it!

I sense it...
Somewhere in this city...

are the emanations of
a powerful magic user!

You must locate the master of
these powers. Is that clear?!

Yes!

Round and round the little birds are
Kuru kuru kotori wa

Playing in the sky
Sora de asobu yo

Tra-la-la... Let's line up
Too-la-la-la narande

And sing as we walk along
Utatte arukou

Country lanes and paths go on and on
No no michi komichi wa tsuzuiteiru

Somehow, isn't today a nice day?
Nanda ka kyou wa ii hi ja nai?

With a light heart (Bouncing, floaty)
Kokoro karuku (Hazumu yo fuwa fuwa)

With confidence (How far shall we go?)
Mune wo hatte (Doko made ikou ka)

The path of the clouds (Watch them as they go)
Kumo no yukue (Miokutte)

Let's sing out, the hum of Hallelujah
Utaou yo, hanauta no hareruya

Someday, you'll meet the girl for you
Itsu no hi ka ano ko ni mo aeru yo

NEXT EPISODE

Meow, meow, meow!
Did you see it?! Did you see my magic?!

I absolutely, positively have
to be related to magicians!

If I'm around, my magic will
make everything a snap!

Next week is... Next week is... uh...

Meow 2
