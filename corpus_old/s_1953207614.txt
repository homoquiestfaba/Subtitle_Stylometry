I feel within me
many different people ...

.. a mulitude of beings and each
would make their own way.

The strangest thing is that they all
speak at once, but not all together ...

.. they interrupt, contradict
and merge into a great tumult.

What can I do?

I remember
when I was 12.

I was a quiet child, but each
day I was punished by my father.

We Uzeda's were an old
family of Spanish origin ...

.. who had been living in Catania
for more than 100 years ...

.. so said my grandmother,
the Princess of Francalanza.

ltaly was divided in several states
and Sicily was ruled by the Bourbons.

Raimondo
do not leave me, please!

Princess, I am not Raimondo I am
Casimiro your faithful servant!

Baldassarre, who suffered
to see me punished ...

.. was the son of my grandfather
and a maid ...

.. but forced to work as a butler
on the orders of my father.

Dear Prince, just a few more feet!
Why?

Why .. because your father wants to make
a man of you. You know he loves you very much.

-I think he really hates me!
No!

Come, my darling, let me see.

Does it hurt much?

Consalvo!

What?
The coach is leaving, look!

Where is our father now?
Something serious happened.

Why lower our flag?
It means that someone died.

Who?
Try to imagine. - Grandma?

Our father is talking to grandma.
No, he is praying.

The feud Ganci, 7,000 ounces ...

.. Palazzolo's estate, at least 10,000.
You would have taken it to the grave!

Damn!

Behave!

Is it true that your aunt Lucretia
is in love with lawyer Giulente ...

.. But they will not let her marry?
Yes, Watch it, poor thing!

And your Aunt Clara?
This is her third pregnancy.

The children are always stillborn!

Smile! We need to give a tip to
the undertaker who prepared ...

Maybe one day he will do us
a great service!

-Your father's uncles.
-The reading of the will cause a fight!

Uncle Raimondo is
Grandma's favorite son.

He just came back from Florence.
I want to be like him.

I want to travel, have fun, and
meet new people ...

They say he betrayed poor
Dona lsabella Matilda ...

.. the wife of Count Fersen.

Because Giacomo loved us all here?
He did not say.

-The will stipulates the division of assets.
Calm down, please.

-Watch your brother or he will take everything!
Do not worry. Giacomo will do everything right.

You're a dreamer! Do not come
and complain to me later!

Silence, please.
Mr. Notary, we can begin.

"I the undersigned Teresa
Uzeda born Rizza..."

".. widow of Consalvo Vll,
Prince of Francalanza ... "

".. being of sound mind,
command and order ... "

Your grandmother has left Raimondo
half the estate!

-Your father has been duped!
-What does that mean?

When you grow up you'll understand!

Poor Giacomo! - The law is the law.
-He must split the family's assets with Raimondo...

Your own home!
We shall see yours!

I will have the administrator
divide the property immediately.
-I trust you completely.

Now I will wait in the ?,
You think of everything.

Father, what does it mean
that you have been duped?

-Shut up! What are you doing here?
-Waiting for mother.

-When will you return to the monastery,
Giovannino? -This evening, uncle.

Your mother makes you go too often,
if your father was still alive ...

If you continue to make me angry, I'll
send you to the monastery like your cousin!

The monastery never!

Must I share the ownership of Aci Trezza
with my brother Raimondo?

Unfortunately the law of primogeniture
has been abolished ...

.. Your Excellency can not claim rights
that once belonged to the first born ...

.. but there is
a way to limit the damage.

Your mother entrusted these papers
to me to destroy, Your Excellency.

They are IOUs.
Look at the signature of consent.

Just delete it
and they will be again as before.

Turning them all into debts to be paid.

Payable by
my brother Raimondo!

If one day your brothers
want their share of the inheritance ...

.. They will have to
pay off those debts.

My mother made these things?

When did my mother ...

In early July
cholera broke out in Catania ...

.. so we decided to take refuge
at Belvedere, our farm near Etna ...

.. where, my father said, cholera
would not reach us.

For me it was a happy summer,
we children could do as we wanted.

Father was so focused on the problems
with the inheritance he forgot to punish me!

The bills must be honored, my dear aunt.
That means mortgaging the estate. - Unfortunately.

To exclude Raimondo he
sought the support of his relatives ...

.. Dona Ferdinanda and Don Blasco.

It's better here than in the monastery.
Your Excellency. I like the monastery ...

.. But if you say so ...
I say so!

Aunt Clara was about to give birth.
Do not worry, I'll be fine.

Aunt Matilda was always looking for
her husband. -Have you seen Raimondo?

No.
Do not worry, he will return shortly.

Come on, Michele, follow me!
Wait! Consalvo!

Consalvo, I can not enter!

Fortunately my husband took his advice
and we left Catania.

If we were killed by cholera, I
would have done with the heat!

I can not get used to it. In Warsaw, where
I was born, the climate is very different.

Then, Earl?, when do you return to Florence?

Sincerely, Dona Isabella, at one time it gave me pleasure, now the idea just gives me a feeling of emptiness.

Tomorrow my husband's hand
with your brother to visit ...

How beautiful horses are in the wild!

Matilda!
Raimondo, finally!

Where have you been all this time?
The weather is getting worse ...

.. and if it rained in Catania,
it would be better for cholera.

Where have you been?
Don't I have the right to spend time alone?

Uncle Raimondo!

She lost Dona lsabella
when he was with you to the creek. (?)

I will restore him!
Who knows how it'll be looking for!

Unhappily, you always do damage!
I only told the truth!

Shut up!
Let go!

Do not worry. You'll be fine.
But do not leave me alone. - Quiet.

Uncle Luke has arrived!
Consalvo go slow! - Wait!

It is lawyer Giulente.

Let me be the first to greet him.
You are a Uzeda ...

.. and he is just a lawyer! Remember!
Where is Giacomo?

Unfortunately came with Dona Isabella's
husband, Count Fersen.
I want to marry him, Aunt.

-You must help me.
Gentlemen, I have important news.

The reign of the Bourbons is about to end.
He will not be happy, I hope!

This young man asked me to join
the liberal movement.

You have joined the revolutionaries?
May I Dona Ferdinanda?

This is not about joining a revolutionary
movement but with the moderate liberals.

Dreamer! The Piedmontese will throw you out
and give you his ass to kiss!

When they have conquered Rome
burned churches and holy places!
Blasco, do not say this crap!

Do you think I would put in with those people?
The Duke is right, believe me.

I have decided to leave.
How would it be? - Yes

Where?
I want to join the fighting forces.

If there will be a fight,
I want to be with them.

But I did not know that I
would have to fight immediately!

Because if I were younger,
I would come with you!

If you were younger you would have escaped
the race! I am your brother and I know you well!

Good heavens!
Countess Clara's waters have broken!
The pains have started.

Here we go!

Do not worry, Federico.
Everything is going well.

Hopefully it would not end
as before!

Mother I want to go to see Aunt Clara.
You can not.

Then I go to play.
Yes

Federico! The news
reached us the road!

Count Fersen accompanied me
back in his carriage. - Dona Matilda ...

All right? - He suffers terribly. Calm yourself.
Soon you'll be the happiest man in the world!

Thanks.
Where is Raimondo?

He is out riding his horse,
but he will be back soon.

Be brave, be brave Clara!

Oh, God! But what is it?

Prince, what are you doing?

If your father finds you here ...
Come, come.

Baldassarre, go to the kitchen.
Get a large bowl.

and bring all the alcohol in the house.
What should you do?

The child was a girl. Clara
wants to keep her. - Poor thing!
What a misfortune!

Will a child never live?

Who can it be?

He has come back.
Who? - My husband.

There'll be trouble if he finds you!

What are you doing there? Have you gone mad?

A Uzeda can not run away like a thief.

Do not spoil me, please! I beg you.
Don't. Please!

Come quickly.

Signor Conte! - What has happened?

Your brother is waiting for you in the study.
What do you want?

Count Fersa, good morning.

What is the urgency?

I would not have bothered if the honor
of the family was not at stake.

Is this yours? Count Fersa
found it in his room ...

.. Yesterday afternoon when he returned home.

I put everything right so your
wife should not suffer a scandal.

But now you must leave this place,
maybe you should return to Florence.

At least for a while '. - To Florence?
Do you need any money.

Signor Marco will be responsible for you,
but on one condition ...

.. the authorization to delegate me
to deal with your share of the inheritance.

Say it like it is:
It is better to blackmail than to steal!

You want to
take away what is mine!

If you do not sign,
a scandal will errupt!

You will have everyone against the family,
the Church and all Catania!

If you sign, you have my support
to quell the situation.

Now you must decide whether
to forgive your wife ...

.. or to get Fersa
if you prefer.

Please.

Uncle Raimondo, will you take me with you?
Not today, another time.

Are you angry because of the handkerchief?
No, without knowing you helped me.

How?
I'll explain, one day, when you are older.

That day Uncle Raimondo
walked away from the villa ...

.. abandoning the poor Matilda
for the wife of Count Fersa.

My father got what he wanted and from
that day he took command of the whole family.

It had always been his dream to control
everyone and everything!

Thank you.

Giacomo ...

I ... I must speak to you.

I'm here.
It is about lawyer Giulente.

What do you want?
He wants to know if ...

.. he can ask me to be his wife!

Have you ever heard of a Uzeda who
married someone who was not noble?

But Benedetto is a lawyer, and
is an honest and courageous man.

Yes?
Yes!

Being honest and courageous
means nothing!

But I ...
But you What?

Nothing.
So much the better.

It is late. It is lunch time.
Do not wait.

I'll make you change your mind, I swear!

Run all you want, I'll wait here!

I have heard!

Bitches!

-Shut up!

Rosa

Rosa

Why did uncle and Rosa come
into this room? - I do not know.

Is our cousin beautiful?
Yes, they keep her locked in the closet.

She is a child, she is a fairy.

And light as a butterfly,
has smooth skin of a rose ...

.. And blue eyes.
We open the closet and see.

-That ugly!
-Consalvo!

What are they doing? Wretch!
I want to see my cousin.

-You run off to your room!
Let me go. - This time I'll make you pay!

You'll see!

Bread and water for another day.
Tomorrow morning we go.

What's the matter. Have you lost your voice?
Don't you want to know where you are going?
211th
You will enter the monastery. The Benedictines
will take care of your education.

You will enter the monastery. The Benedictines
will take care of your education.

You will enter the monastery. The Benedictines
will take care of your education.

The monastery
will help increase the word!

You have not eaten anything!
Your father does this for your own good.

Or so he thinks.
He's not like you. He hates me!

I have to kill to be happy?

Do you want me to end in the ground?
Don't do that  ...

Why should I go to the monastery?
There you'll find your cousin.

I am not a second fiddle like
Giovannino! Mama I do not want to go.

I don't want to go, I beg you!

I can not do anything,
your father has decided. You know him!

Dear brother!
Dear nephew.

Do you know that St. Benedict watching us
in these moments ?

Answer the father.
No!

When I was young I did not want to
come here either. - Have you heard?
Here is your cousin Giovannino.

Fra Carmelo will accompany you to
the monastery. Say goodbye to your father.

Giacomo, come and see
the new library.

I must shave. - I do not shave like you, I'm not
sheep. - All novices shave their heads.

My cousin Consalvo
does not want to shave his head!

Your Excellency, I beg you, enough!

I tried too!
Shh!

Where are you going? - I am like
your brother Michele ... firstborn

.. you have no right to keep me here
I'm going.

-You will now.
If you spy on Fra Carmelo.

Fra Carmelo does not worry at night
who goes out, but who comes in.

Here in the night is like a carnival!
You'll see

We must hurry,  because they are coming.
Who? -You will see!

Look at that.

You see all those caps? Do you see?

Well? The monks are returning to the monastery
They are not monks, they are women.

Women dressed to enter the monastery
without anyone noticing.

What are you saying? - They are the mistresses
of the monks. - What their lovers?

Yes, their lovers. Do you know what they call
the monks of this monastery?

The pigs of Christ!
You're crazy!

Your great-uncle even had
a daughter with Carmen!

Don Blasco?
Do not you believe me? Follow me!

Who is that?
Carmen, his mistress.

And she is married to
the barber of the monastery.

Don Blasco does not give a damn
no matter the monastery ...

.. Forced him to stay here as a child.
Does Fra Carmelo also have a mistress?

No, he is a saint, even if he is
the bastard brother of Don Blasco.

When I grow up I will
marry your sister Theresa. And you?

I will never marry. - Why?
My father will want to choose my wife.

Do not worry,
one day everything will change.
254th
Sooner or later revolution will break out
and we can escape.

Sooner or later revolution will break out
and we can escape.

Sooner or later revolution will break out
and we can escape.

And then? - All will become
equal. I was told by the cook.

Soon cooks may become to become nobles.
And what will we cecome ... cooks?

The nobles will be beheaded.
Us too?

The cook is my friend. He'll save us.

They pray at this hour?

They are poor friars, the Capuchins monks.
So?
261st
The Rule prescribes that the Benedictine
monks must pray during the night.

The Rule prescribes that the Benedictine
monks must pray during the night.

The Rule prescribes that the Benedictine
monks must pray during the night.

The Benedictine monks are rich
and don't like to wake up ...

.. They have contracted the Capuchins
to pray for them.

You were right, it's a carnival!

-Your turn, Serafino.
It's not my name.

Everyone has to take the name of a
saint. Giovaninno Sebastianuccio and is called "Serafino".
267th
Come on. There.

Come on. There.

Come on. There.

Stand still.

That's it! - Bravo, Serafino!
Not my name.

Come on.

Serafino, please keep your head straight!

Serafino, Sebastianuccio!
Garibaldi has arrived!

Close the monastery
or kill us all!

We are free!
We are free!

Garibaldi has arrived! He is the antichrist.
It is the revolution!

Garibaldi and his excommunicated followers
closed the monastery and stole our riches.

Let's take them before they do!

Long live freedom!
Damn you!

Long live the Bourbons!
Don Blasco What will we do without you?

We are free!

In the seven years
spent in the monastery ...

.. many things had happened.
Uncle Raimondo did not return to Catania ...

.. And my father took over the maternal
inheritance leaving the others just crumbs.

My sister Teresa said that every month when she
and my mother came to visit me at the monastery.

A Bourbon soldier! Catch him!

Death to the Bourbons!

Death to the Bourbons! Viva Garibaldi!

Come! Viva Garibaldi!

See lawyer Giulente! He lost a leg.
Viva Garibaldi!

With him there's your great-uncle,
Duke Gaspar!

Long live united ltaly!
Viva Sant'Agata!

What's your name? - Concetta.
What a beautiful name! My name is Consalvo!

Are you from Catania? - Sure.
Why is your hair so short?

What? - Why is your hair so short?
I just escaped from the monastery!

From the monastery? - Yes.
It was my prison!

Long live freedom!
Welcome back, Dear Prince.

Rosa, what is going on?

Where is my mother?

A doctor is with your mother.
The doctor?

Consalvo, what are you doing here?
What are you doing?

Your father told us to escape,
Catania will be put to the flames.

She is very delicate. TB has reached the lungs
But can she travel? - I strongly advise against.

-I'll accompany you.
Thanks.

Mama ...

Mama ...

I am, Consalvo. Speaking ...

What are you doing here?
Have they occupied the monastery?

What have you done?
He's staying here, do not you see?

Why did not you warn me?
The Belvedere air will do you good.

The doctor said mama
can not travel.

Let me stay here with her.
Do you want your head cut off?

-You come with us, get ready.
I am staying here.

We will leave at dawn, do not argue.

Consalvo, you're back!

Teresa!

-Come. - No.
I beg you!

Teresa ...
Mama.

Consalvo, approach.

Let's pretend ...  your father wants.

Let's go. -Yes, Mother.
I will always be with you.

I will not leave you again, mama.

Tancredi, stop playing!
Come here, we leave.

I told you to take care of the suitcases.
Who is this child?

I asked who is the child?
He is the son of Rosa.

I did not know that Rosa had a son.
Why does Aunt Clare carry him?

Teresa answer? - He is the son of
Rosa and Uncle Federico.

Uncle Federico has a son
with his wife's maid?

I wanted it after the
last pregnancy went wrong.

So for Aunt Clara considers he is her son
and she never leaves him to Rosa.

It's a monstrosity,
Don't you see?

Dear Giovannino, come ...

to Catania tomorrow ...

Do not touch it!

Mama! Mama!

Consalvo!
Damn!

Come back!

Tomorrow we will return to Catania and
we will bury your mother.

You know it is a great pain
that I have lost her.

But life goes on.

This morning they came to visit me
lawyer Giulente and Uncle Duke.

The lawyer will be appointed
Mayor ...

.. And he assured me that we are in
no danger. We can come back.

We will have a friend in the mayor
and to strengthen this link ...

.. I consented to his marriage
with your Aunt Lucretia.

But how? You said no Uzeda ever ...

.. was going to marry
a man without a title?

I consented for the sake of the family
and to protect you all.

True true, I understand.

You know also your right, Teresina?
I have a surprise for lawyer Giulente.

He can not marry with one leg!

Another good news
is that cousin Graziella ...

.. bound by love of  the deceased ...

..  has agreed to take care of us.

We have taken decisions
for your future.

At 16 years
Teresa will go to school.

But I ...
You are what?

You, Consalvo, with the new year
start studying again.

Your new mother and I thought ...
Who told you to get up?

Did you say "mother"?

You said "mother"?

My mother is dead! She's dead.

How and who because of ...

.. You know better than me.

The young lady has something to say?
So much the better.

Back in Catania, my father was
always sequesteredin his pharmacy ...

.. preparing remedies against the evil eye and
bad luck that he thought I brought.

Consalvo, the saint and Reverend Father Antonio
are here to expel the evil from the building.

The evil is completely visible,
without exorcism!

My father squandered the money so
and I had to do with Giovannino!

He learned that Don Blasco lived joyously
with money stolen from the monastery ...

.. With his lover and her husband, who did not mind being cuckolded if it were paid well.

Meanwhile Sicily became
part of a new state, ltaly ...

.. And the wind of democracy
had arrived in Catania.

Welcome, dear aunt.
What is this? Long live freedom.

Freedom is a word that means
nothing but pleases everyone.

You see, aunt, when the king commanded
the Uzeda's we were his friends ...

.. Now that he has sent the beggars
must be their friends.

Turncoat! Traitor!
What do you say?

... Freedom also means now that Italy is
established we must take of our business!

Now come inside. Today cousin Graziella
and I will make a happy announcement.

Michele, do not start to eat everything.
Behave yourself!

Take example by your brother.
What have I done?

Giovannino,  have you seen Consalvo?
Don't worry he will come.

He would not want it to spoil the party.
Not true.

So Giacomo, do we want to make
this announcement or not?

As some of you already know,
cousin Graziella cousin and I ...

..  decided to get married.
Hooray!

But first there's a surprise ...

.. to our beloved mayor and new
family member, lawyer Giulente.

I thought of a gift
equal to the task ...

Pure mahogany.

This is for you.
Thanks. - Hooray!

Is the dog a bit restless. And
my gift for your marriage!

I'm sure you succeed
to tame it in no time.

Baldassarre! Bring it on.

Why is this ugly child
in my carriage?

Goodbye, Tancredi.
Come back soon! - Come on.

Sale to spend my money partying and idlers.
Give it time. Change you'll see.

Stop. Giovannino.
Where are we going? - To the monastery. Go

And  look there is the girl with whom we
danced the night of Garibaldi.  Do you remember?

Beautiful! Cheers!

Tomorrow I'll return here
and send an invitation to a hunting lodge.

By God! Look see
the monastery in this state!

What desolation!

Consalvo, come and see
where we slept!

Giovaninno Where are you?
Novices. What is my duty to your Prior?

That indicates the lost sheep
the way of salvation.

Serafino, please head straight and how many
times did I tell you not to drink the Prior's wine!

Bravo, Sebastianuccio!

Fra Carmelo, what are you doing here?

We were drive out, but I
stayed here. This is my home.

Do you remember the dormitory?
You stayed here and you there.

Fra 'Carmelo ...

Where are you taking me?
Where?

Celebrating the day of your
Liberation! - We like to joke!

To the port. On to the harbour and
who repents ... is dead! - Gallop!

What are you doing?
I can not go there.

You young people have fun but ...
There are no other places open at this hour.

I'll return to camp outside the monastery.

These are for you. Take them.

But you also have to take something.

You are good, keep it up.

To the monastery.

Come on, go.

My husband Poor Orlando! His thoughts
are far away! His mind wavers!

Do you remember me? - Certainly your Excellency.
Finally I found you.

I tried for a while '.
Why? I wanted to see you.

Now that I have seen?
I want to see you again.

And when?
Do you know the hunting lodge of my family?

It is on the road to Biruni.
Meet me there tomorrow evening.

I will have a surprise for you.
Really? -Yes, certainly.

All for you!

So? Will you come?

Tell me what you will!

Do not stand there, is for you.

Is Your Excellency joking?

I want to try it.
Here? Now?
440th
From there there are mirrors,
so you can watch.

From there there are mirrors,
so you can watch.

From there there are mirrors,
so you can watch.

You stay here?
Sure.

Do not be afraid,
you do not do anything.

All right? I come in?

You're beautiful!
It would take the shoes ...

No, you're beautiful even so.

You are the most beautiful I've ever seen!
-You know so many duchesses and princesses
I have known!

Can I kiss your hand?

Why do you always wear gloves?
-So!

If I asked you to marry?

Prince, do not talk nonsense!
Next, answer.

Prince, if you were to ask my wife, do you know
I would say your father, the prince?

What?
What are you crazy! -Yes?

Do you think my father commands?
Parents demand and children must obey.

Not me.
You too.

Not me!
You too.

Not me.
You too. - Not me.

You too.
Stop! Not me. - You too.

Not me!
No!

No! No!

Come on, Concetta ...
Do not touch me!

Stop crying, calm down.

Please. - I do not want!
I will give you even more.

Damn!

Forgive me.

Sorry ...

Have you seen the Prince Uzeda?

Giovannino ... Michele ...
I'm glad you came.

In Catania the secrets do not last long!

If you have judged better
than I am, you're wrong.

Please, Giovannino, drink with me.

Michele give me a cigar.

Michele, try to call a cab.

The brothers of the girl will
retaliate, you have to go.

I do not care. - Do it for me.
Let me go on. - Next.

Come on!

Come on!

Go!

You paid the coachman?

The girls told me,
Consalvo has sent away the carriage.

Your Excellency,  we are the brothers of Concetta.
You nobles do things in a hurry!

And without thinking!

Consalvo!

Michele!

Help!

I do not understand if I feel
more pain or pleasure.

Do not talk.

Hush!

Deep down you know I deserve it.

Where am I?
We brought you to the house of aunt Ferdinanda.

To avoid the wrath of your father.
Where is aunt Ferdinanda?

She's gone to your house..
That is a family reunion.

Your attackers will not find you. We are organizing
punishment for your attackers ...

.. one of these nights ...
No, you do not.

Do you promise?
I promise.

now we must go. Come on, Michael.

-Giovannino, thanks.
What?

Father, do it again.
Shut up.

Your brother is a wretch,
who brings bad luck.

We must leave naked and raw!, if you do it again,
There would be no morality.

Just you talk about morality?
Yeah.

They wanted to avenge the honor
of their sister ... Right!

Now that your husband is mayor, he can interceed.
I marvel at you! Consalvo committed a disgraceful act!

The fact that my husband is the
Mayor does not changed things.
