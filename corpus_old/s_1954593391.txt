<i>This is Detective Robertson.</i>

<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

- He knows. He knows.

<i>Hello. It's Edith...</i>

<i>And Maisey.</i>

<i>We are not home right now.</i>

<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

<i>Ooh.</i>

<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>all that noise?</i>

<i>Cheese and crackers,</i>
<i>keep it down.</i>

Really?

<i>Hey, is everything</i>
<i>okay in there?</i>

Y-Yeah.

<i>This is Detective Robertson.</i>

<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

Where are you?

Where the hell are you?

You promised me
that you would help me.

You said you'd
get me out of this.

Now I'm so fucked.

Call me, asshole,
at least to tell me

that you don't give a shit
that you sold yourself

like all the other
disgusting cops.

And I'm on my own.

Shit.

Hello.

Hello?

Stop.

No.

<i>Everly.</i>

<i>What a surprise.</i>

<i>I assumed you'd go down</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>

<i>I was wrong.</i>

<i>I'm never wrong.</i>

<i>Did you get my present?</i>

<i>Open it.</i>

<i>I picked it out myself.</i>

<i>Your detective friend</i>
<i>is just the beginning.</i>

<i>221 Shaffer Avenue.</i>

What?

<i>My men are already there</i>

<i>waiting for my call.</i>

No, Taiko. No.

No, Taiko.
No. Please, no.

<i> We had an agreement.</i>
I'm begging, please.

<i>Do as your told, or I kill
your mother and daughter.</i>

Do anything you want to me,

but, please, please,
just leave them out of this.

<i>I don't need your permission</i>

<i>to do anything I want with you.</i>

<i>I own you.</i>

Yes. Please...
<i> Or did you forget that?</i>

If you ever loved me...

<i>This isn't about love.</i>

<i>It's about honor.</i>

<i>You were taken to be a whore,</i>
<i>just like the others,</i>

<i>but when I saw you,</i>
<i>I said, "No,</i>

<i>she's special.</i>
<i>She's mine."</i>

<i>But you betrayed me,</i>
<i>Everly."</i>

You... you're right.
You're right.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I-I was scared,

and I deserve to die
because of it.

But...

but, please,

please let them live.

Let them live, please.

<i>All right.</i>

<i>I will grant you your wish.</i>

<i>You will die in that
room tonight, Everly,</i>

<i>and I'll let</i>
<i>little Maisey live...</i>

Thank you. Thank...

<i>just long enough</i>

<i>to earn back</i>
<i>what you've cost me.</i>

<i>I'm sure your daughter</i>
<i>will be very popular</i>

<i>with the older clientele.</i>

Fuck you.

Fuck you.

Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Come on, Mom.
Pick up. Pick up.

<i>Hello.</i>

<i>- Hello. It's Edith...</i>
<i>- And Maisey.</i>

<i>We are not home right now.</i>

<i>Hello. It's Edith...</i>

<i>And Maisey.</i>

<i>We are not home right no...</i>

<i>Hello.</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

Mom.

<i> Everly?</i>

There's men there.

There's men already there.

You need to take
Maisey and run.

<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you talking about?</i>

<i>What men?</i>

Mom...
<i> Where are you?</i>

<i>Who's that?</i>

They're there.

<i>Everly, what have you</i>
<i>gotten us into?</i>

Mom, you got
to get out of the house

right now with Maisey, or
they're going to kill you both.

<i> Okay, okay.</i>
Come on.

<i>I'm going. I'm going.</i>

<i>Grandma.</i>

Maisey.
<i> I need you to be quiet.</i>

<i>Where are we going?</i>
<i>Who's out there?</i>

<i>Shh. Out the door.</i>

<i>We are going for a ride.</i>
<i>Follow me.</i>

<i>While we are in the car,</i>
<i>scoot over.</i>

- Mom?

<i>Maisey.</i>
Mom?

<i>- Maisey, are you okay?</i>
<i>- I'm okay.</i>

<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>all right, baby.</i>

<i>Keep your head down,</i>

<i>and hand the phone to Grandma.</i>

<i>Put on your seat belt.</i>

<i>Good job, baby.</i>

<i>Everly, what the hell</i>
<i>is going on?</i>

Mom, you need to keep driving.

Don't stop for anyone.

Meet me at McCoy Park downtown.

<i> I'm calling the police.</i>
No.

He owns the police.

<i>This is madness.</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>

<i>Who owns the police?</i>

No time.

<i>Four years ago, you disappear,</i>

<i>and I haven't heard from
you in four years, Everly,</i>

<i>four years.</i>

<i> - ...men showing up</i>

<i>at my home in the
middle of the night</i>

<i>to kill me and Maisey.</i>

<i>What have you done?</i>

<i>And why would we want</i>
<i>to see you, anyway?</i>

<i>First you abandon</i>
<i>your daughter,</i>

<i>and now you put</i>
<i>our lives in danger?</i>

<i>Bitch!</i>
I did not abandon her.

You have no clue
what happened to me.

You need to see me
so I can give you

enough money for you
to disappear tonight.

You have to start a new life
where no one can find you,

or else you're dead,

and Maisey's doomed
to a life of misery.

<i>Calm down so we</i>
<i>can talk about this.</i>

<i>You are not making any sense.</i>

<i> But, Everly...</i>
Meet me at the park,

and call me when you're there.

I love you.
<i> Please tell me what...</i>

<i>Taiko, what the fuck?</i>

<i>It's been raining</i>
<i>fucking bullets in here</i>

<i>for the last 10 minutes.</i>

Broke-ass
motherfucker.

Listen, I've got a dead john

<i>bleeding all over my place</i>

<i>because of that</i>
<i>raggedy-ass bottom bitch.</i>

What the fuck is
going on over there?

Oh, you know I can
fuck her shit right up.

How much we talking?

Damn.

That's all you had to say.

<i>Hello, boys.</i>

Time to get motherfucking paid.

You, stay.

Zelda.

You shot your wad, bitch.

What?

Die, bitch.

Die, motherfucker.

I'm going to fuck you up.

Fucking sai?

<i>You bitch.</i>

Come here. You want
to fuck with me?

You fucked up, bitch.
I'm going to fuck you...

Hi.

Bye-bye.

Oh, thank...

<i>Shit.</i>

<i>Taiko is going to be pissed.</i>

Wait.
Who did I just kill?

Everly.

Nice try.
Wait. Don't kill me.

Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

I can double that price.
I have a lot of money.

Bullshit! You don't have any money
or even go out of this apartment.

He doesn't give you any money.

You think you're better
than us? Huh?

You're just his fucking slave.

<i> Listen to me.</i>

I can prove it to you.

I have enough money
for both of us, okay?

Bullshit. He doesn't
give you any money, bitch.

You don't have...

Okay.

Shit.

Fuck.
That's what I said.

<i>Who the fuck did all this?
You do all this?</i>

Is he paying you for each one?

Dena?

Everly?
You're not dead.

Sorry, sweetie,

but I need that fucking money.

Get the fuck out of here.
She's mine.

Elyse, you greedy bitch,
you have that money.

<i>I don't need your fucking help.</i>

<i>She doesn't even have a gun.</i>

I got here first!
You fucked up.

Fuck you. Fuck you.
You fucked up. It's my turn.

You fucking bitch.
You fucked it up.

What are you saying?
Fuck you.

<i>Fuck you.</i>

<i>- Fuck...</i>
<i>- Fuck you.</i>

Oh, please. Oh, God.

<i>Oh, God, I don't want to die.</i>

<i>Please, help me.</i>

Everly.
Please, help me, Everly.

<i>I don't want to die.</i>

Not like this.

I'm scared.
I don't want to die.

Then shut up for once so you
can save your strength.

I understand
you want to kill me,

but do you want
to kill her, too?

Come on, help me.
Help me.

Please. I don't want to die.

Just put some pressure on here.

I'm scared.

I don't want to go to hell.
Okay.

Anna, you have to kill her.

I don't want to die alone.

I mean, I already
know she's going.

You're going
to be okay. Shh.

What...
Okay.

Shh.

Put some of this on.

Okay.
Okay.

Dena.

<i>Dena.</i>

I'm sorry.
I have to do this.

If I don't,
Taiko's going to kill me.

Anna...

look around you.

I can kill you, too.
No.

<i>We don't have</i>
<i>to do this right now.</i>

I know I'm
going to die tonight,

but I have a mother and a
five-year-old daughter,

and I have to do something

<i>to make sure they're</i>
<i>going to be okay.</i>

Why?

<i>You were a mother once.</i>

Stop. Stop. Don't talk.

Please help me save my child.

After that, I will
come back here,

and I promise it'll be you
who finishes this off.

How do I know
you're going to come back?

Because as long as I'm alive,

he will be obsessed
with hunting us.

But once I'm gone,

he'll forget
about them in time,

and they will be free.

I will make sure I die tonight,

but I don't want to give any
of them the satisfaction.

I want it to be you.

Okay.

I'm going to give you
two hours, Everly,

but don't fuck with me.

Because if you
can do all of this,

then I can do it, too.

Good luck.

<i>That's a lot of dead whores.</i>

You don't get
to call them that.

Get up. Now.

Can't.

How bad is it?

It's pretty bad.

It's just a flesh wound.

It doesn't look fatal.

Can't say the same.

At least you
don't feel anything.

Can I ask you a favor?

Seriously?

I'm thirsty.

You're welcome.

Are you smiling?

Changed my mind.

<i>We're too high up.</i>

Don't even think about it.

Best-case scenario,
the fall kills you.

<i>Worst case,</i>
<i>you break your legs,</i>

<i>and the dog eats you alive.</i>

Come here, Banzai.

I hate that dog.

Me, too.

You know guns,

and you're not a bad shot,

but you're not
going to make it.

Tell Taiko
he can lick my balls.

Told you.
<i>- My turn, bitch!</i>

I'm nobody's bitch!

<i>No, please don't.</i>

Finally.

Ralph.

Sorry.

Hello.

<i>Everly, where are you?</i>

<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>leaving 20 minutes ago.</i>

I was. Just had to wrap
some things up first.

<i>Of course.</i>
<i>Maisey's cold,</i>

<i>and I don't like it up here.</i>

I'll call you
when I'm on my way.

<i>Okay.</i>

Oh, shit.

Great.

<i>Police, ma'am.</i>

<i>Ma'am, the building's</i>
<i>not safe. Open up.</i>

<i>What's going on out there?</i>

<i>I'm all alone, and it's
the middle of the night.</i>

<i>- Get out of here.</i>
<i>- Please open up, ma'am.</i>

<i>We're evacuating the building.</i>

<i>Why don't you get rid of all
those whores around here?</i>

<i>It's like in the Bible,</i>

<i>you know, Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

<i>You have to evacuate</i>
<i>the building, ma'am.</i>

<i>This way, please.</i>
<i>Follow me.</i>

<i>I'm not going anywhere</i>

<i>until my daughter gets here.</i>

That poor woman.

Her daughter's
been dead for two years.

<i>- Okay...</i>
<i>- Good night!</i>

<i>You have a video feed
of the building?</i>

Fancy.

You know how much
he likes to watch.

<i>I suppose it would be
too much to ask you</i>

to kill me instead
of have to face him.

<i>I didn't join in.</i>

I could have.

Oh, how generous of you.

Oh, wait.
Should I be offended?

I was just following orders.

And that absolves you
of any responsibility?

No, but some of these guys

actually enjoy this.

The rest of us
do it out of fear,

because if you don't,

Taiko will kill you

<i>or worse.</i>

Taiko has forced me

to do so many things so vile,

<i>human trafficking,</i>

sex slavery.

Gang rape.

Talk to God.

I'm not interested
in your confession.

<i>Wait.</i>

<i>Don't leave the video
for him to see.</i>

Don't.

Trust me.

Destroy it.

<i>No!</i>

Look at me.

<i>Sayonara,</i> Dead Man.

Come on.

<i>Come on.</i>

You can.

You can.

<i>Taiko says he'll be in touch.</i>

You have yourself
a merry Christmas.

<i>We've got her pinned down.</i>

That's a lot of dead whores.

Asshole!

<i>Callate, pendejo.</i>

I told you.
There's no way out.

What are you going to do?

Either you can help me

or shut the fuck up.

<i>May I suggest an idea?</i>

No.

<i>Something my grandfather</i>
<i>would say.</i>

I think I had my fill

of Buddhist proverbs
for the day, Dead Man.

A sanctuary sometimes resides

in the eye of the storm.

<i>Mom.</i>

I'm sorry. I cannot
get out of here,

so you're going
to have to come to me.

You need to get rid
of your car.

It's probably being tracked.

<i>What? No, no, no, no.</i>

<i>I am not giving up the car.</i>

Forget about your car.
Forget about your house.

You must come get
the money and vanish.

<i>Isn't that dangerous?</i>

Well, of course
it's dangerous here,

but it's dangerous everywhere.

<i> I don't know.</i>
Listen. Listen.

I have a plan.
Come over here.

When you're getting
closer, call me,

<i>and then I'll explain to
you exactly what to do.</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

157 Hopper Avenue.

<i>I am afraid.</i>

I'm scared, too.

<i>I'll call you when I'm there.</i>

<i>So...</i>

we are having company.

You may want to clean up.

Shit.

Do you think Maisey
would like this dress?

What?

I think maybe you
should wear something

<i>a bit more practical,</i>

just in case.

Yeah.

Better?

<i>Yes.</i>

Much better.

Now, what am I
going to do with you?

Could I ask you
for a last favor?

Why not?

Can you light me a cigarette?

You know,
smoking will kill you.

<i>Arigato.</i>

One thing I don't understand,

how were you able to
get to the police?

They got to me.

One day, my toilet broke,

and a plumber showed up

that was not really a plumber.

He promised
to get me out of here

and into the Witness
Protection Program

if I helped him.

Weren't you afraid
that he would find out?

Every minute of it,

but I kept thinking,

if they get the motherfucker,

I can go back to my family.

Are you guys here?

<i>We are walking</i>
<i>into the lobby now.</i>

Tell them that you're
coming to see your mother,

Mrs. Haberdash...
<i> Haberdash?</i>

That she's been
complaining about

somebody trying to get her
out of her apartment, 7E.

<i>Get off on the seventh.</i>

<i>Take the stairs to the sixth.</i>

I'm at the end of the hall.

I'll be waiting for you.
<i> Seventh floor. Okay.</i>

Are you ready
to meet the family?

Are you?

N...

<i>This way, Maisey.</i>
<i>Stay with me.</i>

Mom, say something.

<i>Can I help you, ma'am?</i>
Say something.

<i>Yes, we are coming</i>
<i>to visit my mother.</i>

<i>Sorry, ma'am. We had
an incident earlier.</i>

<i>Who exactly</i>
<i>are you going to see?</i>

<i>Um, Mrs., um...</i>

Haberdash.
Haberdash.

<i> ...Haberdash. 7E.</i>
Yes.

<i>She's just calling me about
these strange people</i>

<i>trying to kick her out</i>
<i>of her apartment.</i>

<i>This used to be</i>
<i>a very nice neighborhood.</i>

<i>Right,</i>
<i>Mrs. Haberdash.</i>

<i>Lovely lady.</i>

<i>Tell her sorry for the noise.</i>

<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>we had an incident.</i>

<i>- It should all be over soon.
Thank you.</i>

<i>Come, Maisey.</i>

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>Come, come, come.</i>

<i>We are in the elevator.</i>

<i>Be right up.</i>

<i>Six.</i>

Seventh!
<i> What, Mom?</i>

<i>- Siete.</i>
<i>- Oh, no, seven.</i>

<i>My mistake.</i>

<i>Seven.</i>

<i>You're doing good, Mom.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

Hi, Mom.

Hey.

I'm...

Everly.

You were such a little
girl last time I saw you.

Can we continue this
inside, please?

No, Mom.

There is no time.

You have to take
the money and go.

I'm sorry.

Seriously, you have to go.

Cartoons.

Hush. Not right now.

<i>Aw, but, Grandma...</i>

Hello.

<i>Hajimemashite.</i>

Who is this?

This is...

a long story.

Maisey.

<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to be afraid of me.</i>

<i>You know what?</i>

I think I have something
you might like.

It's a Christmas gift.

It's for a very special
little girl.

Would you like to see it?

I'm sorry. I didn't
have time to wrap it.

She's been waiting for you
for a very long time.

Would you like to hold her?

You like Pinky Bear, right?

Yeah.

What do you say?

Thank you.

You're welcome.

She is very pretty,

<i>like you.</i>

Well, I would love
for both of you to stay,

but I understand
you need to go.

If they ask you
about Mrs. Haberdash,

just tell them that you
need to put this in the car

and that you're
coming back to get her.

Maisey, I need to speak
with Everly in private.

Stay put right here.

Don't move.
Don't touch anything

<i>or anybody, okay?</i>

Mom, we really
cannot do this now.

I am not going
to ask you twice.

Where is the bathroom, please?

What?

Keep an eye on her.

<i>Hai.</i>

Hi.

Hi.

<i>No, Mama.</i>

I don't know
where to begin, Mama.

There's so many things
I'd like to say to you.

But I can't.

There's just no time.

I can tell you this.

I was taken against my will

<i>to be someone's slave.</i>

I've been locked up in this
apartment for four years.

<i>I-I don't know</i>

<i>if you understand that.</i>

What are you doing here?

Just visiting.

What's that?

Don't go over there.

Why not?

Because I need your help
with something.

What?

I wanted to sing
a song for you,

but I forgot the words.

What song?

<i>"Itsy Bitsy Spider."</i>

I know it.

I know it.

Are you sick?

I am,

but singing always
makes me feel better.

You're funny.

Thank you.

I did not want you to
get involved in this.

I did everything I
could to protect you.

Who is this man?

He's the Devil.

What did he do to you?

Did he torture you?

No. I am luckier
than most girls

that get sent overseas
or stuck in a dungeon

<i>where they are</i>
<i>raped constantly.</i>

<i>They don't even last that long.</i>

For me, my worst torture

was losing my child.

<i>That's it.</i>

It's over. I am here,

and we are leaving
together right now.

Let's go.

Mama, this is not a telenovela.

Who do you think you are?
Forget about me.

I don't want you to be
a part of this world.

- What's that now?

<i>That's who he is.</i>

<i>That's what he brings,</i>

<i>mierda, muerte.</i>

You must leave without me

so you can protect Maisey.
Do you understand now?

Hey.

Where did you go?

Is this a Christmas present?

<i>Not exactly.</i>

Everly.

It's wet.

<i>Everly.</i>

Can I open it?

I don't think
that's a good idea.

Everly.

What do you think it is?

I couldn't even imagine.

Come on.

You are not leaving here alive,

are you?

Sorry, Mommy.

<i>Everly.</i>

<i>No!</i>

No!

Stop. Stop.
Don't touch.

Don't touch that.
I'm sorry, honey. No.

My sweet little...

are you hurt?

Oh, my.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I screamed
at you, honey.

You know, that gift...

was not for little...

Okay.

<i>Sweetheart.</i>

Maisey.

Maisey!

<i>Oh, honey...</i>

<i>come...</i>

Banzai.

Hey, Banzai.

Banzai...

kill!

Banzai, no!
Not him, her!

Banzai, kill that bitch!

Banzai...

ball!
Oh, shit.

Banzai, no!
That's not a ball!

Mom?

Mom?

<i>Everly.</i>

It's okay.
You can come out.

Oh, that doggie
was scary, wasn't it?

I'm going to show you
a trick, Maisey.

When things get scary,

you close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

You imagine snowflakes,

and you start counting the
little, tiny snowflakes.

One...

Why we are watching
television now?

<i>Two, three...</i>

Shit.

<i>Don't say that.</i>

Sorry.

Shit.
Let's go.

Seven,

eight...
We can make it.

Nine,

10...
Okay.

<i> Stay there. Stay there.</i>
...11...

Stay there. Stay there.
...12...

Anna, open the door, please.

<i>Anna, my little girl is here.</i>

Can she watch cartoons
in your television?

10 minutes.
10 minutes.

16...

I just got to take care

of some business, but it's
coming up the elevator.

And then I'll come back up,

<i>okay, and I'll pay</i>
<i>my debt, but just</i>

let them in for 10 minutes.
Come on.

Both of them.
Come on.

Just keep them there
for five minutes,

five minutes.
Come on, Anna.

Okay, for her.

Get in.
Come on. Come on.

Come on.
Come on. Come on.

Deal's not done.

I understand.
I understand.

Holy shit.

What the fuck now?

<i>Where are...</i>

No.

No!

A make-up artist.

Sulfuric acid.

Gasoline.

<i>Oh, God.</i>

Battery acid.

Sodium hydroxide.

<i>No, no.</i>

No, no.

No. No.

What are you
going to do to me?!

<i>No, no, no!</i>

<i>Stay away from me!</i>

No. No.

H2O.

<i>Quit with the noise!</i>

<i> I'm coming down there.</i>

<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to give you a what-for...</i>

<i>You killed her.</i>

Please stop.

No.

No. No.

No.

No!

Don't touch her. Don't
you fucking touch her!

<i>Stop! No, don't!</i>

No.

No, no.

No.

<i>Stop!</i>

If she dies, you die slower.

No.

<i>Mom, don't swallow it!</i>

No. No.

Come on, Mama. Mama.

Wake up. Look...

Mom, come on.

You have to throw up.

Come on, Mom,
please. Throw up.

Come on!

That's okay. That's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay.

It's okay. It's okay.

<i>Kanpai, puto.</i>

It's okay, Mama.

It'll be all right.

It's going to be all right.

What more do you want,
you son of a bitch?

Haven't you had enough?

<i>With a show like this, never.</i>

<i>By the way, how's your mother?</i>

<i>These past few hours,</i>

<i>it's been extraordinary,</i>

<i>but now it's time</i>

<i>to watch you truly suffer.</i>

<i>Your mother has fought</i>
<i>the good fight.</i>

<i>Now it's time for you</i>
<i>to say good-bye.</i>

<i>Everly.</i>

<i>Pick up the phone, Everly.</i>

<i>I'm not done with you yet.</i>

<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

Fuck you.

Everly!

Everly!

Everly!

Happy holidays, Everly.

And so it ends,

not with a bang,

but a whimper.

You are nothing.

You don't exist.

This is all a nightmare.

If I die,

it'll be like waking up.

And if I don't...

it'll be your nightmare,
motherfucker.

You have been a revelation.

<i>But don't kid yourself.</i>

You have only gotten so far

because I allowed you to.

If you're going to do it,

just do it, and shut up.

After all you've
been through tonight,

<i>did you really think</i>

I would make it that easy?

Yeah.

<i>Why haven't you killed me?</i>

Maybe you can't bear

the thought
of living without me.

Maybe no matter what I do...

you just don't want me gone.

Hmm?

Maybe I go across the hall

and get your daughter,

make her watch
the rest of this.

<i>Does little Maisey know</i>

that her mother is nothing
but a used, discarded whore?

Keep my daughter's name
out of your mouth!

Your bastard child
should be honored

that I even know its name,

<i>that I let it live,</i>

in spite of its
traitorous mother!

No!

Frankly, death by my sword

is an honor you don't deserve.

I would take your heart,

but your betrayal has shown me

that you don't have one.

You stole my life.

I owe you no loyalty.

I fucking hate you!

I loved you.

Tough shit.

It's infinitely more painful

to remove a tattoo

than it is to receive one.

And the same is true for love.

You don't have
to go through the pain

of removing your love for me...

so I will take back my tattoo

as a souvenir.

You branded me like a cow.

Take it.

<i>Turn over.</i>

I want to look at your eyes

when I kill you.

<i>If I die by your hand,</i>

you and Maisey

will never be safe.

<i>Then die with honor.</i>

Do it yourself.

What happened

to honor in love?

You'll never
know love like I do.

<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>with Pinky Bear?</i>

Take Pinky Bear.

Take Pinky Bear,

and she'll protect you.

Okay? Yeah?

And promise she's going
to stay with you

and you won't lose her?

Promise me.

Okay. Now, I'm going
to be right back.

Don't move.

<i>Hello.</i>

<i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

<i>911? Yes, I need help.</i>
<i>There's a little girl...</i>

<i>Ma'am, I'm going to need</i>
<i>you to calm down.</i>

<i>- Who is it?
Can you tell me where you are?</i>

<i>Ma'am, please. Hello?</i>

<i>- Go away!</i>
<i>- Ma'am, are you there?</i>

<i>If you're talking,</i>
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

<i>- No, get out!</i>

<i>Get out!</i>

<i>All units, all units,</i>

<i>please be advised,</i>

<i>A.D.W. in progress,</i>

<i>157 Hopper Avenue.</i>

<i>Respond code three.</i>

<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

<i>Grandma?</i>

<i>Ma'am, keep talking.</i>

<i>I'm not hearing you.</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

<i>Ma'am, can you hear me?</i>

<i>Hello, ma'am?</i>

<i>Ma'am?</i>

<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

Grandma!

<i>Grandma!</i>

If you're feeling scared,

you close your eyes

and count snowflakes.

One, two...

It's okay, little girl.
...three, four,

<i> five, six...</i>
Open your eyes.

...seven, eight...
Turn around.

Nine, 10...

Turn around!

<i>Maisey...</i>

you're safe.

Maisey.

Come here, honey.

I know I might look scary,

but I would never
do anything to hurt you.

Come sit with me.

It's over.

I know who you are.

You do?

You're my mommy.

I have your picture in my room.

That makes me very happy.

You know what?

I've always had
your picture with me, too.

And now I want you
to have it, okay?

I want you to keep it

and think about me,

my little girl.

Why were you gone
so long, Mommy?

I miss you.

I miss you so, so much too.

<i>And...</i>

not one minute went by

where I didn't think about you.

I had a hole
in my heart right here

every second we were apart.

But today, when I saw you...

ah, Maisey,

you filled my broken heart.

I love you, always.

Always and forever?

Forever and ever.

I-I love you, Mommy.

Mommy?

Medics! Come!

I'll take it.

I'll count the bag.

Come on.
Hurry up. Here.
