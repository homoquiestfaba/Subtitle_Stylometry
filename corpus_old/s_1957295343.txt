Our Sunnyvale Devils

Instead I find myself here

as a husband,

a father, as a neighbor.

And, yes,

mayor of Sunnyvale.

And on behalf of all of the people
in my town,

I say all of Sunnyvale mourns with you.

Yeah, really looks like they give a damn.

[man 2 over speakers] My family's been
in Sunnyvale for generations,

and now my brother is mayor

and I your sheriff.

We've prospered here.

And yet, I've seen you,
our neighbors in Shadyside,

suffer tragedy after tragedy.

It's easy in times like this
to drown in questions of whyâ€¦

Why this happened.

But I know too well

there are no answers
that will provide relief.

There's no peace found in the past.

Can we talk for a second?
No.

You broke up with me! Remember?
So stop acting like I'm the bad guy.

Yeah, well, I'm not the one
who moved to Sunnyvale.

OK, you made the choice.
I just made it official.

My parents got divorced.

I didn't have a choice.


You just couldn't wait to start
your new fake life with your fake-ass mom!

I am half an hour away.

It might as well be the goddamn moon,
and you know it.

I don't know anything.


I know you were always too afraid
to tell anyone about us.

I know that.

And I know that douchebag out there
was squeezing your ass.

You broke up with me.
What's his name?

You broke up with me!
What's his name, Sam?

The dude groping you.
Stop. Stop!

[Deena] Touching you!
Peter!

His name is Peter!

We must not fall into darkness.

We must look to the light.

What we should do is light a fuse

and burn down Shittyside.

What'd you say?

You don't get it!
[Deena] No, no. I do.

There's not much of a future
in Shadyside with a lesbo.

Best case is what?

Dead on the mall floor
after a double shift,

or maybe, maybe if you're really lucky,
you're the one carrying the knife.

I said it ain't a tragedy
when it happens every week.

It's a joke.

Jesus. You're doing it again.


"Welcome to the suck!" "Shit is doomed!"
Shit is doomed!

someone opened the emergency exit.

I don't remember that.

No?

He also saw you with the cooler.

Did anyone else see that?

Maybe you were just, umâ€¦ goofing around.

Why do you know so much about killers?

Know thy enemy, right?

You hang onto any of that candy?
[Josh] Yeah.

Then his mask came off.

And you saw him?

Yeah. Yeah, the mall killer, Ryan Torres.

That's Ryan Torres.


Yes, that's him.

I know, but you guys must have made
a mistake or something. Lookâ€¦

I know what I saw.
OK.

Let me get the right paperwork.

"Dead killer chasingâ€¦"

Would you say he was more, uh,
<i>Dawn of the Dead</i>

or <i>Night of the Living Dead?</i>


You don't believe us?
This was a waste of time.

We've had prank calls, we've had reports
of skeleton mask copycats all weekend.

Got a call from the hospital.
Lady sounded worked up.

[Deena gasps]

Uhâ€¦ wait, I'llâ€¦ I got it.
Take care of them.

This is bullshit. There are bodies
at the hospital. You're gonna see...

Honey, we are so appreciative of this tip.

The killer is still out there!
We'll do our damnedest to catch him.

You're a monster!
You're supposed to protect us!

Hey, hey! Young lady, do not test me!


I have no idea what came over me.

Get out of here!

Go find your boyfriends!
Tell them you need to relax!

[Sam] Deena, slow down!

[Sam] What are you doing?
[Deena] Just walk, fast.

We need to leave.

I think we should stay. We're safe here.
What if that psycho shows up again?

Then we'll be ready.
[Sam] What the hell?

Deena, what is that?

Is that the cop's? You stole a cop's gun?

Fuck yeah she did!

You out of your goddamn mind?
They didn't believe us.

We're on our own.

Where the hell is Simon?

["You Always Hurt the One You Love"

<i>â™ª You always hurt â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The one you love â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The one you shouldn't hurtâ€¦ â™ª</i>
[Simon screams]



[Simon yells]


[Simon yells]

Simon, come on!
[Simon screams]

[Kate] Come on!
[Simon] Go! Go! Let's go!


Come on!
[Simon] Sam! Come on! Run!

<i>â™ª You alwaysâ€¦ â™ª</i>

It'sâ€¦ it's not possible.

Bullets didn't stop her.
Amazing observation.

Who the hell was that?
How the hell should I know? Sheâ€¦

She was hot! I don't know!
The bitch seemed normal!

I hate to break it to you,

but normal bitches
don't bleed black fucking blood!

Well, she was hot and normal

until she attacked me
with a fucking razor blade!

Wait. Whatâ€¦ A razor?

Yeah, for like old-timey shaving,
or in this case, I guess, slitting her...

Wrists. She slashed her wrists.

Was she singing something?

Was she singing a song, like an oldieâ€¦
like an oldie song?

Jesus, Rain Man.
How the fuck do you know that?

This is Ruby Lane.

<i>â™ª You always hurtâ€¦ â™ª</i>

[Josh] The girl who attacked you.
[Simon] Holy shit!

She sang as she murdered her boyfriend,

her friends, then she killed herself.
Slashed her wrists.

Jesus. Yeah, why didn't I see this
on the news?

Because it happened 30 years ago.

1965.

Ruby is one of Shadyside's killers,
just like Skull Mask.



Look, 1978.

[girl screaming]
[Josh] Sixteen years ago.

[Josh] "Masked psycho murders kids at..."
[Kate] Camp Nightwing.

Yeah, my mom's sister was there.

That screwed my family up for a long time.


Harry Rooker,

local milkman slashes
a bunch of housewives.

1935, Humpty Dumpty Killer.

1922, Billy Barker.

1904, Grifter guts girls, and on and on.

It happens in Shadyside over and over.
Normal people turn into psychos.


[indistinct voices whispering]


That's the pastor, Cyrus Miller.

1666. He was the first one recorded.

He, umâ€¦ killed kids
and cut out their eyes.



I, uh, brought youâ€¦

I always liked this sweater.
Yeah, I know.

If you get blood on it, I'll kill you.

What's happening to us?

There are people trying to kill us.

Dead people,
if you believe my weirdo brother.


That's not what I meant.

Yeah, I know.

Look, I know I always give you shit
for pretending you're someone you're not,

but it'sâ€¦

It's not really easy for me toâ€¦

you know, be like usâ€¦ either.

Are you giving me a pass?
[chuckles] No.

Fine. I'm not gonna say
what I was gonna say.

Say it.

[Sam sighs]

Maybe you'reâ€¦ you're right.

Maybe shit is doomed.

I mean, here we are.
We're together for one night and...

Dead people are trying to kill us.


It's Sarah Fier.

She's turning Shadysiders into killers.

Do you really believe that?

No one actually thinks
that this witch shit is real.

Yeah, it's something babysitters make up
to scare kids.

No, no. Just listen to me.

1666, Sarah Fier was hanged
for witchcraft, fact.

But ever since she was executed,
she's been possessing people,

turning them into killers,
to take revenge on the town.

[Simon] It's like the nursery rhyme.
[Josh] Yeah. Yeah.

she found a way to cheat her death."

"By cutting off her cursed hand,

she kept her grip upon our land."

"She reaches from beyond the grave

to make good men her wicked slaves."

Yes, exactly.

Don't you see what's happening to us?
This is all proof.

Shadyside isn't just
some hotbed for psychos.

All these massacres are connected
to Sarah Fier.

The witch's curse is real!

Fine. Let's assume that the witch
has been possessing people

for some sort of messed-up vendetta.

This isn't the same as the mall massacre.
Something different is happening to us.

Something way worse.

OK, we have two of her killers after us
and both of them are dead.

Why is she so mad at us?


Last night, I don'tâ€¦

I don't know, you know.
I thought I hit my headâ€¦

It wasâ€¦

It was her.

I saw the witch.

[ominous drumbeat]

[crickets chirping]

I can't believe you're wearing that.

Can't believe you're above it,

when we're in the middle
of the fucking woods

and dead maniacs are after us.


[high-pitched shrill]

OK, so I fell out of the carâ€¦

here.

I was crawling,

and my nose was bleeding.

And thenâ€¦

[metal clinking]
I feel something.


Oh! Not just chains.

[Kate] Holy shit.
Oh my gosh.

No way.
Oh!

Fier. It's her.

It's her grave.

Oh no, no. No!

This is bad! This is really bad!

No wonder the witch is pissed at us.
I'd be pissed too.

Sam disturbed her grave.

her henchmen after us.

Henchmen?

As in every one of those sickos
on your wall is coming after us?

[twigs snapping]

Did you hear that?

[breathing heavily]


She's mad
because we disturbed her grave, right?

Yeah. So?

So, let's un-disturb it!

Just put the bones back, rebury them,
and put her to rest!

No, that's so stupid!

That's genius!

Yeah! Inâ€¦ in <i>Poltergeist!</i>

[twigs snapping]
[gasping]

Whatever.
Let's do it quickly so we can go.

[dramatic music playing]


Deena, Deena!
Find something to wrap her bones!

[ominous music playing]





Your noseâ€¦


I think there's someone in the woods!

[metal chains clinking]

[woman whispers] <i>It's you!</i>

<i>It's you!</i>

We need to hurry!

There, there.

We're sorry.

Did it work?

Did it work?

[breathing shakily]

[dramatic music playing]

[Josh grunts]

[Simon] No!
[woman screams] <i>It's you!</i>

[screaming]
[Deena] Go, run!

Run! Run!

Go! Come on, go!

Start the car! Go!

[engine starts]
[tires screech]

That was the Camp Nightwing Killer!
That was a bust!

Yeah, maybe because
it's not like the movies, OK?

It's not as easy as putting bones to rest!

It should've worked. It always works!
[Josh] Maybe it's her missing hand.

Who gives a shit? It doesn't matter.
Hey, how do I not die?


And I'm looking at you, witch nerd!

Iâ€¦ I don't know!
They're not coming for us!

They're coming for me.
What?

I saw her againâ€¦
[woman whispers] <i>It's you.</i>

The witch. Sheâ€¦ I disturbed her grave.

[woman whispers] <i>It's you.</i>
She wants me.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Nightwing ran right by me.

I jumped out his way, it was like
he didn't even see me. He went for her.

Guys, no! Ruby attacked Simon.

Skull Mask came after us at home.
And while you guys were babysitting!

[brakes screeching]

No, he didn't.

Skull Mask didn't care about us.

He wanted this. Sam's blood.

What the fuâ€¦
Oh!

Yeah! From the crash
when Sam puked period!

It's <i>Jaws</i>, dude!

A shark smelling blood!

When we found Skeletor,

he was all sniffy and weird with my shirt
like a perv in a pantie shop!

Yeah, but he came to our house too!


now the witch wants more of her blood!

OK, so what do they do in <i>Jaws?</i>

They didn't go skinny-dipping
with the goddamn bait.

She's not bait!

Yeah. She is.

Seriously, if we're right
and they're after herâ€¦

let's give these assholes what they want.

[sirens wailing]


[menacing music playing]


You can't have any of Sam's blood on you.

Well, not much I can do about that.

Deena, you have to get clean too!
Not a single drop, OK?



I don't want to go in by myself.

[exhales slowly]

Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

Holy shit, your shoulder.

It's fine.

OK, well,

fine or not, we sâ€¦ still need to cover it.

[soft music playing]


this is going to work?

I do.


Can you help me?

[dramatic music playing]

[Sam sighs]

This is all my fault.

I'm sorry.

When I went to Sunnyvale,

I ran away from you.

Because you were, likeâ€¦

this reminder.

I was scared of this.

Of us.

Of me.

And, like, tonight's been the first time

I've felt like myself inâ€¦

months.

It's been so long.

I forgot what thatâ€¦ what that felt like.

You make me feelâ€¦

like me.

["Sweet Jane" playing]

<i>â™ª Anyone who's ever had a heart â™ª</i>

We set the bait.

<i>- â™ª Hey, hey! â™ª

Thenâ€¦

See you on the other side.

Oh!

Guys?

Holy!

Run! Run!

Go! Go!

[menacing music playing]


Help me!

They're coming!
They're gonna keep coming!

We're fucked!

No, no! We are not fucked!

She's fucked. They're coming for her.

If we put Sam in the hall,
we end this now.

You're a monster.
I'm being reasonable!

We can't run anymore.

A bullet won't stop them, fine.

They're really strong.

But we just tried to goddamn explode them,
and that didn't work!

You're suggesting killing her.

I mean, that's not exactly
what she's saying.

Oh, you're on her side?

You'd let us all die to protect her.
Look at this.

OK, all of this.

Dead, dead, dead!

This is the way.

It's the only way.

Sam's gotta go.

Are you kidding me?

[inhales deeply] Kate's right.

I don't want you guys to die for me.

I'm going.

I'm ending this.

No, you're not.

Are you crazy?

No.

No, Sam!

Sam!

Sam!

Let me go! Let meâ€¦ Sam!

Let meâ€¦ Help me! Help!

We're killing her!



[Deena crying] Please!

Please!

[breathing heavily]

[Sam screams]
[he roars]

[Sam] Whatâ€¦ whatâ€¦ what is going on?
[Kate] You're not doing this alone.

[Josh] There's another way.
[pounding on door]

C. Berman.
[pounding continues]

She's the key.


Group of campers, brutal massacre.

There was one Shadyside survivor,
C. Berman.

"The still traumatized girl claims that
amidst the carnage she saw the witch."

Yeah, just like you.
So, if she survived, I'm pretty sure...

There may be a way for me to live too.

9006 Brennan Way.

This has gotta be her!

Uh, 155-4747!

[ringing tone]

No one's answering!
[voicemail] <i>The Berman residence.</i>

<i>- I'm not home right now.</i>
I need some help here!

<i>- Please leave a message after the beep.</i>
No one's there!

Hello, my name is Deena Johnson.
I think you saw the witch.

[Simon grunts]

This shit is not gonna hold!

We need to know how you survived!

Hey! We're being attacked, alright?
There are killers here!

If you're there, please pick up!
Please answer!

<i>- To record a new message, press one.</i>
Fuck! No!

[Simon screams]
[Kate] Help!

[Kate] Help us!
[Simon] Help!

[Josh grunts]

[ringing tone]
[Sam] She died.

[pounding on door]

She died.

What? No, she's alive.
That's the whole point.

Yeah, sheâ€¦ she survived, butâ€¦

but first she died.

[pounding on door]

in the woods."

"Her heart had stopped
but local boy performed CPR."

What if this is it?

What if that's how she survived?
Her heart stopped.

She survived by dying.

What is it? The fucking rhyme.
The fucking rhyme!

"She'll take your blood,
she'll take your head!"

"She'll follow you..."
"Until you're dead."

[pounding continues]
It's just like Kate said. OK?

The witch wants you dead.

Soâ€¦ we kill you.

And then, just like this C. Berman bitch,
we bring you back to life.

What are you saying?

[dramatic music playing]

Fuck it. I'm dying tonight
one way or another.

Let's try to bring me back.

[breathing heavily]

[Simon] Let's do it!
[Deena screams]

[ominous music playing]

Let's Timothy this bitch!

[tires screeching]

[soft menacing music]

[clicks pen]

[soft menacing music intensifies]

[menacing music crescendos]

[ominous music playing]

A few months ago, my brother Timothy
had an unfortunate experience

in which he ingested too much
of a certain substance.

He was dead for two minutes.

Butâ€¦

we got him back!


It's time for your close-up.

You need to take these in order.
Pile one takes the edge off.

You're gonna feel like
you're being fucked by a unicorn.

Pile two is gonna bring
your core temp <i>way </i>down.

You may feel slightly sick.

You need to take a five-minute interval
between pile two and pile three.

That's really important, OK?
Pile three brings you down and out,

so take that "take five"
or it's all gonna go to shit!

How many do we have?
Tons. Like a thousand.

Wait. EpiPens?

Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.

This is what brings her back.
This is Jesus!



Remember half an hour ago,
when you wanted to murder me?

You don't have to do this. You can leave.

Remember when you decided
to sacrifice yourself for us?

We're ending this together.

Die well, my friend.

We got back door patrol.


I'll run interference up here.

[ominous drumbeat]

OK, I got stock room.
You take the emergency exit.

Whoa! No, no, no!
Splitting up is not a good idea at all.

But, dude, listen to me.
I know that this is all fucked,

butâ€¦ we gotta do this.

Kate,

she's a crusher.

She doesn't have time for most people.

I know.

She's being nice
because we're probably gonna die.

No! OK, wellâ€¦

maybe we're gonna die,

but Kate is not nice.

She sees something in you.

So?
So, see that in yourself, dude.

We would not be this far
if it weren't for you.

Now we have to keep those psychos
away from Sam.

So goâ€¦

[slaps shoulder] â€¦man up,

and check that exit.


Deena.

What if we fuck up and just kill me?

What if you can't bring me back?

Listen to me.

When you left,

I saw it all.

My whole future,

my whole life in Shadyside.

A night shift, a day shift,

and a million empty beer cans,

just like my dad.

No way out.

But tonight, even though we are in hell,

I feel like I have
another chance with you.

And I'm not gonna lose you again.

Because you, and we,

are the way out.

When this is all over,
I am gonna take you on a date.

[both chuckling]

We're going to eat cheeseburgers
and listen to the Pixies,

and make out and have
the best night of our goddamn lives.

But right now, you've got to die.

Now, look at me. Look at me.

I am going to bring you back.

Sunday, October 2nd, 1994.

Wanna tell me what happened?

We were picking up Sam's prescription.

And the lights went out.
It was pitch black.

I couldn't really see anything.

We ducked behind a counter.

We hid until it was over.

How'd you get that?

I fell on some glass.

[clears throat] Fell on some glass.

in your shoulder.

I fell on some glass.

Sam, you look like a ghost.
Like you just came back from the dead.

Shock, I guess.

I'll tell you what the facts tell me.

[inhales deeply] The junkies...
Kate and Simon?

They weren't junkies.

They were my friends.

They're to blame for everything.
That feels too easy to me.

But that's the story
this department will go with

unless you can help me
to see it differently.

Another Shadyside tragedy.

An underprivileged overachiever
with bright prospects.

A guy who's been supporting
his family alone since he was 15.

Both succumbing
to the quick cash of drugs.

Fits the narrative, right?

[inhale deeply] Nice and neat.


I should have listened to you. I'm sorry.

I'm listening now.

But there's nothing else to say.

Do you want your friends
going down for this?

No.

But they're dead.

[indistinct police radio chatter]



Oh, OK.

So I'm a bad guy because I'm in here.

Then that makes you a bad guy, too,
little man.


Let's go.


[coughs]
Anything comes to you, call me.

[prisoner sighs]

[Nick scoffs]

Man, you ain't my family.
