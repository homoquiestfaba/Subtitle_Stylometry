Hello? Hello?

Hello?

Another day.

Another day.

Go away.

Go away.

When I say stop,
you have to... morning.

Have a nice day.

<i>Autumn sales have started.</i>
<i>Bargains galore.</i>

<i>Up to 100 percent off</i>
<i>selected items.</i>

<i>24 hours a day at babyc.</i>

<i>We've cut out all the bad news.</i>

<i>We live in a chaotic,</i>

<i>confusing world.</i>

<i>So many choices,</i>

<i>so little time.</i>

<i>What do we need?</i>

<i>Who do we love?</i>

<i>What brings us joy?</i>

<i>Mancom, making sense</i>
<i>of the good things in life.</i>

Ahem.

I hope you enjoyed
our presentation.

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Now, if you'll please follow me.

Please stay together.
Here's your chance to observe

mancom's proprietary q-void
computation system in action.

No photos, please.
Thank you.

We call it the power of six.

Six degrees of convergence,

providing stability
for business or personal needs.

As you can see, our company
encourages an atmosphere

of vigorous
but healthy competition.

<i>Hello, qohen leth.</i>
<i>Corporate health maintenance</i>

<i>have approved review</i>
<i>of your disability request</i>

<i>for today at 14:40.</i>

<i>Please be prompt.</i>

We're nothing if not prompt.

All right, Quinn.

How's it hanging?

It's qohen, Mr. joby.
And as we've told you before,

it isn't hanging well.
We're dying.

You should see the medics
about that.

Can't afford to lose you.

We have an appointment
this afternoon.

Not this afternoon.

You approved it.
Cancel.

You got still the transfinite
paradox project due today.

Finished.

Pathologics division's running
the standard redundancies.

You do all that this morning?

As mentioned to you repeatedly,
we detest working here.

Considering our output,
we can't begin to understand

why you insist
on our coming here.

That's a management issue.

It's qohen.
Q, no u,

o-h-e-n.
Out of my hands.

Then perhaps we should be
talking to management.

No, no, no. Nobody
speaks to management.

You know that. No way, no way.

Look, take my advice.

Knock off the bitching and
moaning. It's not that bad.

We could accept braving
this ghastly place

were it not for fear
of missing our call.

Oh, that call, yeah.

Could you not let the machine
take it or do call forwarding?

I could always bend the rules
on personal calls in your case.

We have to be home
to receive it.

Look,

I'll see what I can do,
all right?

Sorry.

We prefer not to be touched.

All right.

Qohen leth, ontological
research division,

requesting disability leave.

Or reassignment to work at home.

That's management's
decision, Mr. leth.

We only deal
with health issues here.

What seems to be the problem?

We are dying.
Who's we?

Us. Ourselves.

But there's only one of you.

So it would appear.

This subject has undergone
five physicals the last year.

He's healthy as a horse.

My hair has fallen out.
Perfectly normal.

You're the most productive

number cruncher in your unit.

Entity crunchers.

We work with esoteric data
that have a life on their own

and are substantially
more complex than numbers.

In the experience of this board,

dying people
are rarely so productive.

Nevertheless, we're dying.

No, we're not.

Yes, we are.

No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

We're not.
Yes, we are.

Not. Not. Not.
Bus, bus.

May the party-party
bug.

I'll do this one.

You're not dying.

Although, in a way,

from the moment of birth,
we all begin to die.

Call it divinely planned
obsolescence.

Soon or late, beggar or king,
death is the end of all things.

Why, life might be
seen as a virus

infecting the perfect
organism of death.

That's enough, doctor.

It's true.

Disability request denied.
It's back to work for you.

However, this board recommends

further psychiatric evaluation.

I haven't time
for more therapists.

I hope you'll have time
for this.

Did you hear about tonight?

Changed. It's not 8,
it's 7:30, right?

Okay.
I'm going as a tiger.

All right, Quinn.

I told you, the medics
wouldn't help. Leave it.

It's all right. Joby's
on the job. Problem solved.

You're sending us home?

One thing at a time.
I can get management to see you.

He's coming to my party tonight.

Party?
I'll just give you the address.

You turn up,
and I'll do the rest.

We're afraid we can't.

What, staying in
and washing your hair?

We have to stay home,
wait for our call.

Look, do you want
my help or not?

We fear parties.

Never quite know where to stand.

You kill me, you lunatic.
You don't know where to stand?

You gotta love it.

I'll see you tonight, Quinn.

It's qohen.

Hey! Quinn!

That's the wrong way.
This way. This way.

Party. Party.
Come in. Come in.

Yeah.

This is the main room,
everything's free in there.

Hello, Barbara. How you doing,
darling? All right?

You... she can't...

You see what this is?

You see this?
Know what it is?

That's marble.
It's real marble.

This place is covered in it.
It's my Uncle's.

It was my Uncle's.
He lost everything

in the sit on my Facebook crash.

The removal men
are coming tomorrow.

But tonight, it's ours,

so you party.

Heh. Whoo!

Is management here?
Mm! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Keep it down. You don't wanna
start a rumor, right?

Where's management?
Shh.

On his way. When he gets here,
I'll let you know.

In the meantime, lighten up.
Have some fun for a change.

And mingle, Quinn.
Mingle, all right?

It's qohen.

Yeah, yeah, of course.

Hi.

I love the look.

Final evolution
or re-product?

Maximum brain, minimalist body.

Excuse us.

Sit.

Now, what seems to be
the problem?

We simply want to go home.

Home?

We can tell that you are a man
who values his solitude,

and we too are
better off left alone.

We fail to see the logic
in wasting time commuting

to a cubicle where
we work independently

amid other workers
similarly cubicled.

We could easily double
the output there at home.

And our chief concern
is that we might miss our call.

You see, we've been waiting
for a call all our life now.

And, well, we've...

The nature or the origin of our
call remains a mystery to us.

We can't help but hope
that it will provide us

with a purpose
we've long lived without.

You're quite insane,
Mr. leth.

We're sorry to have
disturbed you.

Drink?
No.

Drink?

Oh! Whoa, Quinn,
you chrome dome bastard.

Where are you sneaking off?
Sneaky, sneaky.

Give me that coat.
We've seen him.

Who?
Management.

Would you stop?
Management parties incognito.

No, this isn't what he...
you're blowing his cover.

We really must go home now.

No. Look, I'll sort
something out.

I'll get you
a proper meeting with him.

There's no way you're going
without something to eat.

It's qohen.

We've had, apparently,
our meeting.

Just one.
Our diet dictates against

any foods
with perceptible flavor.

All right, all right,
all right. Eat, eat, eat.

That's an order.

Plenty of eats.

Plenty more.

Plenty for everybody.

All right.
Hey. Hold. Hold it. Yeah.

What is the meaning
of life, Mr. leth?

Ah. So close to its end
and still no answers.

I have a special project for you

that could prove
to be mutually beneficial.

There's not a lot of time,
not much time at all.

Whoo!

Okay.

You alive in there?

Whoo.
Are you okay?

Yeah?

Yeah.

Excuse us.

Care to join me?
Excuse us?

I won't be long.

So I saved your life.

So what?

Thank you.
You're welcome.

I'm bainsley.

And you are?

Qohen. Q, no u.

And you work with these people?

In a manner of speaking, yeah.

What do you do?
Us? We crunch entities.

You got a mouse in your pocket?
Excuse us?

But who's "we"?

Us. Ourselves.

Oh, catchy.

Hey, help!

You're staring at me.

You think my dress
is incredibly ugly?

Well, it's my daddy's fault.

He used to buy me
these incredibly

ugly clothes to keep
the boys away.

It didn't work.

Only made me wanna get naked.

And that's no way
to keep the boys away.

Excuse us.

<i>We really must leave now.</i>

<i>No, wait.</i>

<i>Just wait.</i>

<i>Wait.</i>

Did anybody ever tell you,
"be careful what you wish for"?

Excuse us?
What's all this about?

You're going home.

Zero theorem.

All very hush-hush.

Management's been handpicking
talent since before I was hired.

Nobody lasts. It's a guaranteed
burnout project.

I worked at it for about
three weeks when I was young.

Drove me balmy.

After zip-t,
I couldn't crunch coco pops.

That's why management
made me a supervisor.

You might've noticed
I'm a few raisins

short of a full scoop.
Ha-ha.

That's why he chose you,
I think. Ooh.

Nothing left to lose.

The tech boys should be
around at your place now,

changing the locks,
setting up the standard

at-home
work force security.

I've got my money on you, Quinn.

You'll be proving
that theorem in no time.

What exactly will we be proving?

That management's
getting desperate.

Have you ever wondered

where all the stuff
you crunch winds up?

VoilÃ .

Here. Put this on.

Come.

Neural net mancrive.

The center of management's
entire operation.

Smart as shit
and still learning.

Now, be very, very quiet.

We're hunting entities.

Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

Today's the same, Bob.

Don't mind me, Bob, I'm just
getting Quinn started

on the old zipster.

That's a waste of time, Bob.

I give him two weeks.

That's Bob, summer intern.

Why does he call you Bob?

Oh, Bob calls everybody Bob.

He says it's a waste of brain
cells remembering names.

Typical hardware specialist.

Isn't he rather young for that?

No, that kid could program
before he could walk.

Right. Now,
here's your software.

Management will send you
new data downloads every week.

How long is this project
going to take?

Don't know.
It could take forever.

When I was a little tyke,

everybody thought neutrinos
had no mass.

Somebody discovered
they do have mass.

Tiny little bit of mass,
but mass is mass, right?

It's got to add up to something.

That stuff used to
keep me awake at night.

Not that you should worry.
Everything's under control.

You got everything you wanted.

Ever get a feeling the world's
giggling behind your back?

That everybody in the universe
is in on some cosmic joke?

Everybody but you. The only
reason you're not laughing is

you're the punchline. You ever
get that feeling, Quinn?

It's qohen.

Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

Well, it pays the same, Bob.

Pays the same.

<i>You seem tense, qohen.</i>

<i>Let's return to the subject</i>
<i>of your fears.</i>

<i>In past sessions,</i>
<i>you have reported</i>

<i>a fear of death, a fear of life,</i>

<i>a fear of open spaces,</i>
<i>closed places,</i>

<i>a fear of people,</i>
<i>a fear of being alone,</i>

<i>a fear of missing certain...</i>
no.

We fear a great many things,
but we fear nothing most of all.

<i>Please go on.</i>
In what manner?

<i>Are you trying to be difficult?</i>
Not at all.

It seems we're capable of being
difficult without trying.

<i>We've spoken about your fears.</i>

<i>Let's speak about your joys.</i>

At present, there's
very little we can think of

that brings us joy.

<i>What brought you joy</i>
<i>in the past?</i>

We recall enjoying food once.
<i>What was your favorite food?</i>

That, we can't recall.

At present, we feel no joy.

<i>What do you feel?</i>

Nothing.

<i>You're a tough nut</i>
<i>to crack, qohen.</i>

<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>I don't mean "nut"</i>

<i>in the pejorative sense.</i>

<i>Let's examine...</i>

<i>- Hello, qohen leth.</i>

No, that...

<i>goodbye, Mr. leth.</i>
That's nothing... no.

<i>We can finish this session</i>
<i>another time, qohen.</i>

<i>Get back to work.</i>
We'll never finish.

These entities refuse
to remain crunched.

Each has its own meaning,
but that changes

depending on the following.
<i>Qohen.</i>

Which then changes <i>deep breath.</i>

Depending on the meaning of...
<i>deep breath in and out.</i>

<i>Deep breath in...</i>

<i>And out.</i>
All we want is our call.

<i>Yes, your call.</i>

<i>We'll complete this session</i>
<i>another time.</i>

<i>Are you an entity process?</i>

<i>Have you tried them?</i>

<i>You should try herbs.</i>

<i>I'm happy with herbs.</i>

<i>Way happy.</i>

<i>They should put them in</i>
<i>the drinking water. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

<i>Black fluoride. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

Are you here alone?

We are generally
everywhere alone.

I love mystery.

Turns me on.

Well, you don't know me,
and I don't know you.

No.

I'm the neighbor.
Mm-hm.

There's always a neighbor
at this kind of party.

Care to come to my place?

We'd only disappoint you

as we have countless others.

That's the best line
I've heard all night.

Thank you.
Mm.

We must leave now.

Hey, wait.

Wait.

Don't say no.

Just think about it.

If it's not now,

some other time.

Just have

to call me.

<i>- Goodbye, Mr. leth.</i>

No, no, no!

<i>- Deep breaths, qohen.</i>

Not you. No, we won't breathe!
<i>Deep breaths, remember?</i>

And you too!

No!

Hello?

<i>Management says</i>
<i>you've got a problem.</i>

Quinn, you tortured little slut,

that is.
Been a long time.

How are you?
Still dying, I see.

What are you doing here?
Field work.

I love it. Gets me
out of the office,

into a snappy uniform.
Ha, ha.

You could use
a woman's touch, Quinn.

Eh...

Ah. Management can't get
through to you.

What's the story?

At present, we have difficulty

maintaining our upload schedule.

The entities are
behaving very strangely.

Yeah.

Personnel meltdown.
I've seen plenty of it.

I'd pull you off the pitch,

but management wants
to give you another chance.

Don't ask me why.

Ooh.

Phone trouble, was it?

Tried to fix it yourself,
did you?

Wrong tool for the job.

Ball-peen's more for hammering
out dents in sheet metal,

not for close tolerance
phone repair.

It's all about
connections, Quinn.

Wires, wireless,

weaving a world wide web.

Can't get anything
if you're disconnected.

VoilÃ .

Tell you what,

this manual work's
giving me a thirst.

You've not got a beer
for a working man, have you?

We have tap water.

Yum-yum.

Thank you.

I miss you, Quinn.

Supervisors don't make
many friends.

You consider us a friend?
Yeah, of course I do.

Of course I do.

So, what's the real problem?

The zero theorem is unprovable.

<i>We still haven't received</i>
<i>our phone call.</i>

<i>You don't trust management.</i>

<i>Nothing adds up.</i>

<i>No, you got it backwards.</i>

Everything adds up
to nothing, that's the point.

What's the point?
Exactly.

What's the point of anything?

You've got a case of
the zero theorem heebie-jeebies.

Don't you think working
sucked the soul out of me?

Bet your big bald buns, it did.

I was nowhere near
where you are.

You're knocking
on the door, Quinn.

No wonder you're stressed.

Sit down.
Sit down.

Do you really have
no idea what you're doing?

We don't care.
All we care about is our call.

Could you inform management

we want our call
and we want it now?

Yes, yes, yes, God,
talk about tunnel vision.

You'll get your call.
You're a bundle of nerves.

You can't work like this.

You're not gonna get
that call of yours

all wound up tight like this.

I've got a friend
who might be able to help.

You said you didn't
have any friends.

Ouch, Quinn, ouch.

That hurts.

It's qohen.

Q, no u, o-h-e-n.

All right. No need
to spell it out, man.

I've got the picture.

Let joby handle it.

Yes?

<i>Mr. leth?</i>

<i>Qohen leth?</i>

Surprise.

Bainsley.

I waited.
You never called.

Oh, you poor thing.

Joby's right, you need me.

You're Mr. joby's
friend?

Well, joby doesn't
have any friends.

I feel so, so holy,

going to the chapel of love.

We prefer not to be touched.

The rent must be outrageous.

Actually, we own the building.

We bought it from
an insurance company

some years ago. There'd been
extensive fire damage.

The previous occupants
were an order of monastic monks

who've sworn vows of chastity...

Poverty and silence.

Apparently, no one broke
the silence to yell fire.

And what do we have here?

Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
Goodness me.

What other surprises
do you have for me?

That was a gift from...

You have...

The most

intriguing bone structure.

So polished.

So, so pure.

Ahh. So pure.

Hey, a mighty big

hard drive you got here.

What work do you do exactly?

Well, I shoot trouble.

Mr. joby seemed to think
that you might

help us get our call?
Yeah.

Yeah, he mentioned
the call thing.

You're staring at me.

We're terribly sorry.

Ahh!

I just broke a nail.

On your big, fat,

stupid keyboard.
We'll get our first aid kit.

Would you please just

kiss it?
Excuse us?

Whenever I hurt myself,

my daddy would kiss it

and make it all better.

Well, we fail to see how...
please.

You call that a kiss?

There.
All better?

<i>Excuse me, couldn't help</i>

<i>noticing this young lady's</i>
<i>pathological attempts</i>

<i>to project upon you</i>
<i>her unresolved issues</i>

<i>of paternal abandonment.</i>

<i>Given the significant</i>
<i>age difference</i>

<i>between the two of you...</i>

nosy bitch.

My daddy didn't abandon me.

He died.

In case you're getting
the wrong idea,

I should tell you that
I don't do sexual intercourse.

I don't care if a guy wraps
himself up like a latex mummy.

But...
but nothing is going inside me.

Way too dangerous.

I'm into tantric,
bio-telemetric interfacing now.

It's smart and safe.

And, God, it just feel

so super tingly.

Got anything to eat around here?

I'm starving my ass off.

Ah. What a mess.

You're staring at me again.
Forgive us.

Well, I don't mind.

Just noticing, that's all.

You're a pretty intense guy.

So here you are, qohen,

locked up all alone

and waiting for...

For what?
For a phone call?

So tell me, what's that
all about? Hmm?

No, we've grown weary
explaining ourselves.

But how am I supposed to help

if you don't
tell me? Hmm?

Please.
Please.

So come on.
How did it all start?

We're not quite certain.

We must confess that

for good or ill,

that we always wanted
to feel different,

unique.

Objective analysis,
however, concluded

that we're as inconsequential
as anyone else.

We are but one in many

single worker bee
in a vast swarm,

subject to the same imperatives
as billions of others.

We dulled our discontent

in alcohol, drugs, sex.

And then it happened.

One night...

Oh, a long time ago,

we were awakened
by the phone ringing.

We picked it up.

A voice on the other end said:

"Qohen leth."

But before we could respond,

we felt this great
yawning maul of power

opening through the phone line.

We felt a sudden rush of joy

unlike anything
we've ever felt before.

Then we knew quite clearly
that we only had to answer "yes"

and the voice would tell us
the meaning of our life.

The voice would tell us

our special calling.

The voice would give us
a reason for being.

And then?

And then...

In our excitement,

we dropped the receiver,
disconnecting ourselves.

You've been waiting
for a call-back ever since?

What other reason is there
to pick up the phone?

Well, communication for one.

It's mostly unnecessary.

But that's what we're doing now.

In a manner of speaking.

So all this time,
you've been waiting

for a mysterious voice

to tell you what to do
with your life.

Wow.

Probably just
a cold call anyway.

If you hadn't dropped the phone,

you'd own a time share
in majorca.

Big deal. Heh.

Do you really believe
everything you've just told me?

Yes.

Okay.

Okay.

I can help you.

But don't go away.

<i>And I'll be back in</i>
<i>a tail shake, all right?</i>

Bainsley?
<i>- Bob, buzz me in.</i>

Bob who?

<i>Bob, I have to take</i>
<i>a wicked pee.</i>

<i>Buzz me in, Scotty.</i>

Our name isn't Scotty.

<i>I know that, Bob.</i>

Our name isn't Bob.
<i>Come on.</i>

<i>I'm doing the tinkle dance here.</i>

Where's your bathroom?

Where's your bathroom?

It's here.

How did you get in?

Fucking magic.

Excuse my French.

Holy shit, man, I think
I did some renal damage

holding it in that long.

Slim got stuck in traffic.

Chubs drove, Bob.

Fast as I could.

Sign here.
What?

A receipt of delivery.

We're delivering...
Bob. Assigned to help you. Sign.

Brilliant. We'll pick him up
in exactly four hours.

Don't lose him.
Don't lose him.

I wouldn't mess with
the clones if I were you.

They look harmless,
but they'd just as soon

flame you to death.

This is a... this is
a creepy place you got here.

Are you okay?

Actually, we're dying.

For me to be with, I mean.

You're a scary looking guy, Bob.

Would you please stop
calling us Bob?

What do you want me to call you?
Mr. leth.

Leth?

No, no, it's too wormy.

Qohen, then.
Q, no u, o-h-e-n.

Gotta buy another vowel.

Q.
Or q.

Yeah, q will do.

Q is you.

Happy now?

Why are you here?

Old man assigned me
to get you up and running again.

The old man?
The boss.

The darth vader
of microprocessing.

The guy I call daddy dearest,
also known as management.

You're management's son?
The one and only.

Heir to his dark throne,

stuck working this summer job.

Order us a pizza.
I missed breakfast,

and this is gonna take a while.

We have oatmeal if you chose...
if I wanted to vomit.

Order the pie, double cheese.

Fuck. Fuck.

How can you work like this?

Oh, it's fucking ridiculous.

Fuck. Fuck.

<i>I can't stand people</i>
<i>gawking at me.</i>

<i>Dad, dad.</i>

<i>Bob's on the job.</i>

That's better.

Who can work...?
Who can work with him

looking over your shoulder?

We have nothing to hide.

The point is moot
since we're not

working for him any longer.

Yeah, right, keep
telling yourself that.

What do you mean?

The old man is not
done with you yet.

But we're done with him.

Like those preceding us,
we have burnt out.

We have decided to quit.
Smart move.

Too bad you can't.
What do you mean? Mr. joby...

joby will tell you whatever
the old man wants him to.

You're a tool.
The old man uses everybody.

That yummy night nurse chick?

Bainsley?
Tool.

No.

She promised to help us.
We are waiting for her.

Wait all you want.
She's not gonna be back.

Your call girl,

she was paid by the hour.

We don't believe you.

So,

what do you think?

This thing is years ahead
of the competition.

It works on nerve endings,
of course but it's also

synced directly
to the brain synapses.

And joby said it was
one of your projects.

We can't imagine.

We never thought of our project

actually having any purpose.

Top secret.

I'm the cyberspace test pilot.

But first, you have
to do something for me.

VoilÃ .

And one size fits all.

Isn't it dangerous?
Oh.

Depends on your idea of danger.

Just trust me.
Suit up, plug in,

and click on
my website at midnight.

You're going out like that?

They can look,
but they can't touch.

And don't be late.

I can't wait.

<i>So here's the deal, q, straight</i>
<i>from the old man himself.</i>

You go back to work
on this nasty zippity-t...

we're no longer interested.
And in return

I get you your call.

You? You will
get us our call?

Yes, I will get you your call.

You're not the only
genius around here.

I'm downloading your shrink-rom
files even as we speak.

Those sessions are private.
Sure they are.

Pizza! Pizza!

Pizza.

Ooh.

Nice.

That's nice.

Uh... where do I put it?

Hmm.

Not just a pizza.

So...

Cash or charge?

Hey.

Thank you.

What are you staring at?

Sorry. Shit.
Nothing.

Uh, um... sorry.
Oops. Heh-heh.

Wrong answer.

Thank you.

Hey.

Thank you.

Ahh!

Holy shit.

Oh, I think I got this
hormonal paradigm shift

going on right now.

Was she looking at me funny?

We've grown accustomed
to people looking at us funny.

Yeah, but you are funny looking.

<i>â™« Not just a pizza, yum, yum â™«</i>

all right, I gotta run.

You can have the rest.

Our diet precludes pizza.

All right, well, save it.

I'll study your files,
be back first thing tomorrow.

You're late.
I'm right on time, Bob.

No excuses. Don't let this
happen again.

I'll be back, q.
You can trust me. Let's go.

Why would we trust you?
You trusted everybody else.

Might as well trust me.
Lose the "we" thing.

I can't work with it.
Too annoying.

Just ask the doc
if you don't believe me.

One size does not fit all.

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>â™« When you were here before â™«</i>

<i>â™« couldn't look you in the eye â™«</i>

<i>â™« you're just like an angel â™«â™«</i>

Like it?

I made it just for you.

The hair.

Something special

for a special guy.
Heh, heh, heh.

We're not at all sure
it's quite us.

Don't be silly.

We no longer drink.

But you can do
anything you want here.

You can drink
and never get drunk.

And you can eat
and never get fat.

Let's forget all about
hammering out

dents in sheet metal.
Hoo!

Mm.

Huh.
Hm.

Good?
Hm.

Where is this place?

All in your mind,

from my mind.

Mm.

Do you feel this?

But it's not real.

It's better than real.

You're in your computer.
I'm in mine.

We're connected by memory chips
and fiber optics.

And we're safe here.

Just trust me.

And let's get
this party started.

Ah! Oh!
Ha, ha, ha.

Ooh!

Hey, come on.

Just come.
Ha, ha, ha.

Hey.

Go. Whoo!

Yah!

Here, here.

Yeah.

Hey?

Qohen?
Qohen?

Who knew?

Can we die here?

I don't think so.

I hope.

You're not supposed to.

Apparently, management
has assigned

his own son to get us our call.

We really think
that he's far too young

to be entrusted
with the responsibility

of such an extent that...
<i>oh, don't be such a wuss, q.</i>

<i>Bob's a genius.</i>

<i>Whiz kid, super brain.</i>

<i>And if you don't know that,</i>
<i>shut up and listen.</i>

<i>â™« Yo, you cannot</i>
<i>will not help you, q â™«</i>

<i>â™« we do wanna help you</i>
<i>ain't it true? â™«</i>

<i>â™« But we won't help you</i>
<i>get your call â™«</i>

<i>â™« we will not help you</i>
<i>not at all â™«</i>

<i>â™« until you function</i>
<i>none will trust â™«</i>

<i>â™« first-person plural</i>
<i>q's are out â™«</i>

<i>â™« we got a plan</i>
<i>for your sure cure â™«</i>

<i>â™« that gives you singular... â™«</i>

How did you tamper with
our shrink-rom program?

Oh, it's easy.
She's a tool too,

in case you didn't notice.

Anyway, how long
have you been talking

like the queen of england?

Longer than we can remember.
Stop. Fuck off.

A former therapist
suggested it as a way to...

yeah, yeah.

As a way to closer
relate to humankind.

Yeah, you keep it up,
I'm gonna hurl.

Dear old dad says I can
use mancom to get you your call,

as long as you keep
crunching, of course.

He's all hot on you.

We can't imagine why.

I've been wondering
about that too.

I figure there can

only really be one reason.

You're the one, q.

You are the chosen one.

You're the one the oracle said

would someday come to us.

The old man picked you

because you're such a work dog.

The man says mush,
you hit the harness.

You drag that sled
till you drop.

You have any idea what
the zero theorem is all about?

Never seemed important.

Okay. Here's the poop,
the whole poop,

and nothing but the poop.

You're trying to prove

that the universe
is all for nothing.

All matter,
all energy, all life,

it's just this
one-time-only

big bang glitch.
Expanding universe

will eventually contract
into a super dense

black hole.

Gravitational forces will be
so strong that everything

will get squeezed into
a point of zero dimension,

and "poof" the center
disappears. No space, no time,

no life, no afterlife, nothing.

Nada, zilch, zip, zero.
Stop.

How would anyone believe
such a horrible thing?

What's so horrible?
I believe it.

Nothing's perfect.
Nothing last forever.

It's nothing to worry about
if you really think about it.

Your father should've assigned
the zero theorem project to you.

Well, he's been trying to,
for as long as I can remember.

But I refused
to work on zip-t.

Why?
Well, because I'm nobody's tool.

All right? That's your job.

<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

<i>Zero must equal 100 percent.</i>

Thank you.

<i>â™« Not just a pizza yum, yum â™«</i>

<i>â™« When you were here before â™«</i>

<i>â™« Couldn't look you in the eye â™«</i>

<i>hey.</i>

<i>â™« You're just like an angel â™«</i>

<i>â™« your skin makes me cry â™«â™«</i>

<i>Don't. Don't, qohen.</i>
Don't what?

<i>Don't use this girl.</i>
We have no intention...

<i>you've built a wall.</i>

<i>How is she to know</i>
<i>what she'll find inside there?</i>

<i>She's an emotionally</i>
<i>damaged girl,</i>

<i>you're emotionally bereft.</i>

This interruption
is unacceptable.

We insist you run a scan
on your program.

<i>Oh. Heh. I'm sorry about that.</i>
<i>Glitch fixed.</i>

Shouldn't the sun
have set by now?

I like to keep it this way.

Yeah. But it's not real.
Heh.

Who cares?

What's the matter?

Hm?

Hey, want to have some fun?

Just take us someplace else.

Us?

Where?
Wherever.

A place all your own.

All you have to do
is imagine it,

and the vr program
will do the rest.

Come on, take a chance.
I'm giving you the control.

Close your eyes.

And now

picture it in your mind.

Take us someplace special.

Wow. Heh, heh.
What an imagination.

Ooh. Where's my bikini,
Mr. qohen leth?

What's wrong?

Aah! Qohen, stop!

Just close your eyes!

We can't!
Qohen, stop!

Is that what's inside you?

How can you live
with that kind of emptiness?

One day at a time.

Tell me you love me.

Just tell me.

I can help you.

We can help each other.

Tell me you love me.

Just trust me, qohen.

Oh, yes, bainsley.

Yes, bainsley, yes.

Yeah, here we can love you.

No more being alone.

No more phone calls.

No more projects.
No. No, don't even think that.

Don't say that.

Here, bainsley.
We can love you here.

We don't care about anything.
No, management won't allow it.

Oh, management.
He has no control over us.

No, don't even
think it. Qohen.

We can think what we want.
If management

doesn't like it, we quit.
No!

â™« Oh, yeah â™«

Excuse us, Bob.

â™« Starting a chain reaction â™« â™«

Bob!

Hey, hey, wanna keep it down?
I'm trying to think.

How you doing
with the mensicles?

We're not precisely certain.

Yeah, well, mush on, q.
Mush on.

Jesus.

Answer your fucking phone.

Yeah?

<i>Your next installment</i>
<i>of processed data</i>

<i>is due for upload in one hour.</i>

Old man's phone doll.
Your next upload is due.

I'm nowhere near ready.
All right. All right.

Uh, we gotta get back to you.
All right. Bye.

Chill, q, don't let
them tentacles get you down.

My guess is they're looking
for the least

little entity.

The entity who could.

Find her and she drags
the rest behind...

oh, there it is, q! Don't let it
get away. I got it. I got it.

Fuck, I'm gonna start
a chain reaction.

Yeah!

What fucking luck.
What fucking luck!

That ought to keep
mancom busy a while.

You're quite good
at this, aren't you?

I can sprint, q,
but I can't go the distance.

If I didn't know
it was impossible,

I'd say you're closing in
on this thing.

Better get you your call

before you prove
that nothing is calling.

Where are you going with that?

Major breakthrough.
Gotta get with the mainframe

and figure out the details

<i>so we can get this baby</i>
<i>flying again.</i>

<i>â™« When you were here before â™«</i>

mm.

<i>â™« Couldn't look you in the eye â™«</i>

<i>â™« You're just like an angel â™«â™«</i>

<i>Oh, yes.</i>

<i>Bainsley, you are so,</i>

<i>mm.</i>
<i>So hot.</i>

<i>Isn't she, boys?</i>

<i>Oh, we're just being joined</i>
<i>by a new stud</i>

<i>for tonight's gangbang.</i>

<i>Bainsley, say hi</i>
<i>to Mr. qohen leth.</i>

<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

<i>Qohen.</i>

<i>We're connected by memory chips</i>
<i>and fiber optics.</i>

<i>This is my place.</i>

<i>We're safe here.</i>

<i>She's not gonna be back,</i>
<i>your call girl.</i>

<i>She was paid by the hour.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>â™« When you were here before â™«â™«</i>

Wakey-wakey, q.
Look what I got. I fixed it.

Check this out.
Look what I made. All right.

Prototype,
soul-searching device.

What do you want?

He's a cranky bastard, ain't we?

Is this what I lost
weeks of sleep for?

Look, this call
you're waiting for,

it's a figment
of your imagination.

There's no such thing.

Not by phone at least.
Ask your shrink.

Yeah.

Yo, yo, yo, doc, you there?

Tell him there's no phone call.

I'm authorizing you

to tell him the truth.

Come on, tell him
he's delusional.

<i>It's true, qohen.</i>

<i>Your phone call's a delusion.</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

<i>I was programmed</i>
<i>to leave your peculiar</i>

<i>pathology untreated.</i>

All right. Thanks, babes.

See you.
<i>But I didn't...</i>

The truth ain't pretty, q.

But like my old man says,

it'll set you free.

Your call ain't carried
by British telecom.

It's coming from your soul,
connect with it.

You know

how everything inside you
releases energy.

This suit will pick up the data

and relay it back
to mancom's neural net.

How can you believe in the soul
if you believe in nothing?

It's called a paradox, q.

I'm young enough to believe
all kinds of things.

Did you know...

That more than 33 different
aboriginal tribes believe

that the soul resides somewhere
in the lower digestive tract?

Absolutely true.

But here's the zinger.

None of these tribes
have any knowledge

of each other's existence.

Coincidence?
Hm?

Coincidence?

Where do you think all these

separate peoples
got such an idea?

Dysentery.

Aha. Q, you're getting
to be very funny lately.

Listen up, if you have a soul,

which I'm betting you do,

this baby will locate it

and connect you with it.

Did you order pizza?
Did you order pizza?

Can I come in?

It's management's son.

You know management, don't you?

I'm so sorry.

Joby told me I could have
the vr suit if I played along.

And you just seemed just...

well, you were lonely.

You're wrong.

We were always alone,
never lonely.

Qohen, please.

Bainsley, Bob.
Bob, bainsley.

She won't be staying long.

Hi.
Hi.

The Hawaiian tropics chick, eh?

Marooned yourself with this guy?

Well, we expect technology

supplied the necessary
enticement.

Yeah, she's like a 10.

There's no way she'd want
an old guy, q. No offense.

None taken.
But I do want him.

I think,

and I'm pretty sure.

What for?
Heh, heh.

There's just
something about him.

Yeah, right.

Must be the preservatives

hey, don't laugh at me.

Sorry.

I know it doesn't
make sense, but...

I need you...
I need you to believe me.

You said you never wanted
to leave me.

That wasn't us,
that was someone else.

No, that was you,

stripped of all your fear.

A cheap virtual trick.

What are you really afraid of?

We accept your apology

and wish you well in all
your future endeavors.

Hoping that management
will assign someone else

to serve as the object
of your affection.

Well...

Everything I own
is in my van outside.

I don't know
where I'm going, but...

Will you come with me?

Jesus, q, do it.

We're afraid it is too late.

It is time bainsley was
on her way. We have work to do.

We'll go somewhere far away,

to a special place,

on a tropical island.

A real one.

Just come with me.

I know we connected
somehow, you know?

I know we did.

And you need me.

And I need to be needed so bad.

Just come with me.

You know we can be
together for real.

Just run away with me.

No, we can't.

Jesus Christ, q,
do you have any heart at all?

Hey, hey, do you need a break?
Yeah.

We feel like a rat
in a rat trap.

I've been ready to gnaw
my foot off since I got here.

Let's get out of this tomb.

Do you mean us?
Yeah.

You and...
Me and yous.

Come on. Whatever happened
to giving up that "we" shit?

Well, we've been trying.

Yeah, sure you have. Come on.
Let's go. Up. Come on.

We haven't been outside
in over a year.

What happened to you, man?

Life happened to me.

Look, life happens
to everybody, all right?

Try thinking about somebody
besides your own selves.

I'm tired. I'm stressed.

And I'm traumatized for
the rest of my poor love life

with the way
you dissed that bainsley,

who is a scabillion times

the woman
that you deserve, so...

I need a break, q, all right?
So get your...

get your fucking head
out of your ass and follow me.

There we are.
Come on. Come on, let's go.

Penny for your thoughts?
No, go. Go.

Come on.
Come on, then.

Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

You don't need...

You don't need skin cancer.

Right, there you go.
This is a big day.

A big day.
We're going to the park.

And I got this new song too,
just for you. Let's go.

<i>Good morning.</i>

You having fun?
Excuse us?

Are you having a good time?

Approximately.

<i>- Your dreams are our dreams.</i>-

<i>"Enough is never enough."</i>
<i>Call us today.</i>

Jeez. What are you doing?

Get out of my way.
Punks!

Fuck you.
I know, I know, I'm fucking...

<i>... Reaches out</i>
<i>to that special you.</i>

They'll never get it up.

A little tail
would make that thing

more aerodynamically active.

Ready? One, two, three.

You ever have a girlfriend?

Yeah, we had a girlfriend
when we were your age.

We spent every possible
moment with our long walks,

movies, lying in the backyard
staring up at the stars,

until her parents
called her in, sent us home.

Very much in love with her,
as we recall.

What ever happened to her?

We married her,
she eventually divorced us

and we never saw her again.

Thanks for that happy,
hopeful little parable.

I can hardly wait for
my own first divorce. Heh.

Yeah, more, more.
That's it, yeah.

I don't know any girls my age.

Seems like getting old
would be pretty boring.

Old people, they just...

they do the same thing
day after day after day.

Like listening to the same song
over and over and over.

Yeah, maybe it's a good song.

Maybe. After a while,
it gets old.

Aah!
Get out of here. Go.

You know, I'm 15.

I'm 15 and already tons of stuff
bores me to death.

Think about what will happen
when I get as old as you.

I'm about to crash.

I need some food.

Do us a couple of dogs, q?

A couple of wieners
for a couple of weenies.

Can we have some relish on ours?

Of course.
You got it.

You know, I just met her,
but I really miss bainsley.

Must be killing you,
losing a doll like that.

Sorry, man.
I'm going.

<i>Just come with me.</i>

<i>We connected.</i>

<i>You need me.</i>

<i>And I need to be needed so bad.</i>

What's the matter?

Just realizing what a jerk
you were dumping bainsley?

I'm just thinking...

Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

I told you.
I've been working on it.

That's what
I like about you, man.

You're not too old a dog
to learn new tricks.

What's wrong?
I'm just dizzy. I'm dizzy.

Just a little dizzy.

You're burning up.

Happens when I don't sleep.
Not a big deal.

You need medical attention.

Just get me two aspirin
and run me a cool bath.

I feel better already.

I just need some sleep.

<i>Bob?</i>

<i>Bob?</i>

Unh!

I... no.

I don't wanna take...

I knew nothing.

Ow.

Unh!

You have made
a very big mistake.

He just needs some rest.
Yeah.

Come on.

I wouldn't wanna be
in your shoes.

Here we go.

We'll be back tomorrow
for the hardware.

Don't touch anything.

We have notified
your supervisor.

Quinn, you bastard.

I just called by

to say thank you for
getting me fired from my job.

You're still a tool.

At least I'm not playing
Patty-cake in a bathtub

with a teenage boy,
you sick freak.

You have no idea
what you're talking about.

I know what I know.

I had a good job till you
came along and you fucked it up

and you fucked up zip-t
and you fucked up poor old Bob.

Well, I'm here to say fuck you
and the entity around it all.

That's f-u-q-u, Quinn!

You know my name.
I know who you are.

Leth!

Do you?

Unh!

I'm afraid you won't find
my son here, Mr. leth.

He's been hospitalized.

Is he all right?

If I believed in miracles,
I'd be praying for one now.

He's not well.

My son's never been well.

I've tried to protect him,

but he's always chafed
at my touch.

This morning, he stole a car
from my vintage collection.

Are you real
or are you just in my mind?

It doesn't matter at all.

You're part of
the neural net now.

So there's no answer?
Depends on the question.

What I'm living for?

That's a good question,
Mr. leth,

posed to the entirely
wrong person.

You seem to have mistaken me
for a considerably higher power.

I'm not the source of your call.
I'm not God or the devil.

I'm just a man
seeking the truth.

What truth if...?
Turn around and look.

That's it.

Chaos encapsulated.

That's all there is at the end,

just as it was at the beginning.

There it is then.
You've proved the zero theorem.

Not quite. Mancom is still,
as you said, crunching the data.

Why would you want to prove
that all is for nothing?

I never said all is for nothing.
I'm a businessman, Mr. leth.

Nothing is for nothing.

What?
There's money
in ordering disorder.

Chaos pays, Mr. leth.

Chaos comprises
a rich vein of ore

that with mancom's muscle
will be all mine

to mine.

The saddest aspect

of mankind's need
to believe in a God,

or to put it another way,

a purpose greater
than this life,

is that it makes
this life meaningless.

You see, this is all
just a weigh station

on the road
to promised eternity.

The reason I chose you...

I mean, rather perversely,
I admit,

is because you represent
the antithesis of my project.

A man of faith.

You see, you've persisted

in believing that a phone call

could give your life meaning.

You've waited and waited
for that call,

and as a result,
you've led a meaningless life.

I'm sorry, but I no longer
require your services.

You pervert! You devil!

You monster!

You tear me up,
charge me interest!

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

<i>I no longer require</i>
<i>your services.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

<i>I no longer require</i>
<i>your services.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

<i>I no longer require</i>
<i>your services.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

<i>I no longer require</i>
<i>your services.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

<i>I no longer require</i>
<i>your services.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

<i>I no longer require</i>
<i>your services.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. leth.</i>

<i>I no longer require</i>
<i>your services.</i>

<i>Mancom, making sense</i>
