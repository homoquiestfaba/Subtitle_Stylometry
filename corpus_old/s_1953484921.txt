Hey, handsome.

Tosha, I know all your
friends think

you're sleeping
with Denzel Washington,

but I can't help that the
brother looks like me.

Randy, didn't I just hear
you talking to someone ?

No.

But I suppose this little
get-together we're having

has something to
do with this

silly online course
that you're taking.

What's it called ?

Shula-kula, or Shasta
Cola or something ?

Kama Sutra.

Old school.

Shasta Cola isn't even
on the market anymore.

The Tantra is about
relationships

between men and women

and their spiritual
and physical connection

to romance
and sexuality.

Look, baby, it's the
spiritual art of love,

of connecting spiritual
and physical form.

Get it ?

It's experiencing love
through the beauty of the earth.

It's about acceptance
and not judgment.

It's about compassion.

You know what else
it's about, baby ?

It's about truth within.

Unconditional love.

Either you have been
hitting the bottle earlier

or you want some
new religion.

Well, the Kama Sutra
evolved from the

Tantra and it's not just about
religion, baby.

It's about
spiritual path.

Well, spirits have
definitely been in your path.

What's the Kama Sutra,
anyway ?

Well, ancient Indians
believed that sex and survival

are the two fundamental forces
that drive human existence.

Having sex to
survive or...

surviving bad sex ?

No, baby, it's not about
good or bad sex,

it's about promoting
healthy relationships

between the sexes.

You think we have time to
promote our healthy,

intimate relationship ?

Hey, hey, hey, hey,
slow down, hot boy.

Listen, baby, tonight is really,
really important to me

and we're gonna
play a little game

and the results of tonight will
help me with my research paper.

So...

Cedar ?

Ooh, I forgot
about the food.

Man, this cedar smells
like my grandma's old wardrobe.

Hey, girl, it's me, hi.

I only have a couple minutes
before this board meeting,

but seriously...

<i>who would have thought a man's</i>
<i>22 shoe size</i>

<i>meant he</i>
<i>had a 2-inch pencil</i>

and could barely make
it past the two-minute mark ?

<i>Girl, I told you about</i>
<i>Devil Douche</i>

You can't trust
those basketball players.

<i>I mean, I would have</i>
<i>done better, you know,</i>

putting out my Mr. Muscle

and renting
a Boris Kodjoe flick.

Ooh, Boris Kodjoe.

Mm-mm-mm.

<i>Okay, I'm scared to ask.</i>

What is Mr. Muscle ?

My new vibrator.

Oh, you are too
out there, girl.

<i>Oh, oh, oh, I'm</i>
<i>out there ?</i>

This coming from
Ms. Kardashian and Ray J.

Okay, please <i>.</i>

<i>Oh, you don't remember, you're</i>
<i>the one who premiered</i>

the Randy and Tosha
sex tape last weekend.

Wait a minute,
wait, wait--

<i>Oh, you know, you were</i>
<i>hitting that bottle</i>

pretty hard.

We all came over for our
usual girls' night out

over at your place.

That I remember.

<i>And then you made us sit</i>
<i>down on your big floppy couch</i>

and we watched the DVD.

<i>No, wait, wait.</i>

That I don't remember--
what are you talking about ?

I played you the DVD ?

<i>One thing I will never</i>
<i>forget is 42 inches of HD</i>

of Randy and Tosha.

"Basic Instinct"
without the ice pick.

Oh, my God.

Randy would ice pick me
if he found that out.

Child, there's just one
thing I've been wanting

<i>How were you able to breathe</i>
<i>with the way his foot</i>

<i>was kind of--</i>
<i>I gotta go, I gotta go--</i>

-- kind of wrapped--

Hey, Bob.

Sandy.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

Are those new glasses ?

Interesting.

I've got so much information.

I'm gonna make you
two look so good.

( doorbell )

Oh, God.

( knocking )

I got it, baby.

Okay.

Hey !
Hey !

Just like white people,
always on time.

And it doesn't hurt that
we live right next door.

Hello.

Hey, how you doing ?

Good.

Oh hey, look at that.

Balance your life.

Elevate your mind.

To you, bring harmony to
family, peace and love.

Lavender ?

No, it's more like-- like
a mix of Old Spice

and cheap French perfume.

What is that ?

Century-old potion that brings
about harmony to your life.

What's with the incense
and the decorations ?

Oh, we're gonna play a
little game tonight,

see what everybody
thinks about sex,

love, happiness and...

Nice !

Oh, that sounds
interesting.

I got a bottle of vintage wine
for the queen of the castle.

Wow, I see that those online
courses in wines and vineyards

has paid off, right ?

Oh, you know it.

And for the king of
the castle...

a majestic offering.

Ah !

I see those hanging with
the brothers in the hood courses

are paying off, too.

Andy, I thought you said
you were gonna make a salad.

I did.

I had to make Martin go
to the store and get some salad.

Hey, you want to help me grab a
couple things out of the car ?

Oh, just like
the white man.

Give you a bottle of Crown and
you're indebted to him for life.

Go easy on him.

I gotta sit.

Yeah, sit-- oh, Andy.

Yeah, Tosh, you know, they say
three is the charm,

I'll tell you,
four is a bitch.

I have had so much pressure
down there all day today.

Three times, I thought my
water was gonna break.

Andy, do you remember last
week at our girl's night out,

do you remember
seeing my sex video ?

Did I see it-- my God.

Girl, where'd you learn
to balance like that ?

Andy, please tell me
that you have it.

The DVD ?

Yes.

No, why would
I have that ?

Oh, goddammit-- Ahh !

What ?

Okay, okay.

What is the
matter with you ?

I'll talk to you
inside, just--

I need a moment,
I need a moment.

What ?

Let's go, go inside.

Oh.

No, no, don't.

Hey, hey, hey,
hey, what's wrong ?

Nothing.

Why don't you come help
me in the kitchen ?

She's just freaking
demanding in the bedroom, dude.

She's like a god damn
drill sergeant.

Up, down, up, down.

What are you
laughing about ?

She's not funny, man,
I got to beg her to be quiet.

I got kids in the house.

Yeah, Martin, how long has
Andrea been wearing

the pants in
the family, huh ?

Really ?

Yeah, I said no.

I think Gabby took
it with her.

Oh... God.

Take it easy.

What's the big deal ?

So Randy finds out that your
raunchy video went mainstream.

Randy doesn't know we
have a raunchy video.

Tosh !

Ooh, you dirty bitch !

And to top all that, I
really need to gain some insight

from this game that we
play tonight in order for me

to finish this
research paper in time.

Don't worry
about it, okay ?

I got your back, girl,
don't worry about it.

Listen to me--
listen, listen.

You gotta be cool.

You cannot let Randy
see you freaking out.

All right ?
All right.

Now help me go get
on that couch.

Grab those cookies.

Another Crown ?

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

I gotta swing
by the lab.

Swing by the lab ?

Martin, you promised...
not again.

I'll be gone two
hours, tops.

That's my husband:
over-dedicated to his job,

but not his pregnant wife
and three kids.

( Tosh )
No, no, no, love,
remember.

Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

To you bring harmony
of family,

love and peace.

I am a chemist.

There's always an experiment to
monitor, there's a--

You know, all this time
that you spend at the office,

what you're doing is you're
testing the experiment

that is our marriage.

I said, balance
your life,

elevate your mind, to
you, bring harmony,

family, love and
peace !

Okay.

The prophet says, the
body and the soul

are bonded together,

so the body and the
environment

are linked
together as well.

Okay ?

All right.

Fine, whatever.

Do what you do.

Oh.

Martin.

I'd be in trouble, too,
if I didn't set Tosha straight.

You ever see
"The Color Purple" ?

Well, there's a secret word to
making women do what you want,

and it ain't "Mister."

He's always gone.

He's leaving me with the
kids all the time,

I'm just sick of it.

Oh, come on, don't
stress, baby.

Tonight is
about having fun.

( doorbell )

Oh, let me get that.

Hi !
Hey, Tosha.

Gabby !
How are you, you
look great.

Thank you.

This is my friend Miles,
Miles, this is Tosha.

She's the lady
of the house.

What it do, Ma ?

I-- Don't I know you
from somewhere ?

I-- I think
I've seen you...

Um, Tosha.

I'm sorry.

Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

To you, give harmony
to peace love and happiness.

Hey, you're getting that on my
new Mariah fragrance.

What is that, anyway ?

It smells like vanilla.

Actually it smells
like bubble gum.

I can't even
smell my cologne anymore.

Tonight's party theme,
we are gonna explore sexuality,

love and romance and this is
gonna help.

Wow.

Sexuality.

The place looks
really nice.

Smells good and
everything, <i>que rica.</i>

Thank you.

Listen, I-- I gotta
take this call.

Can you put this on
the table for me ?

Thank you.

( spraying )

Come in.

Gabby, did I just hear you call
that young man, "baby" ?

Only because from here, he
actually looks like one.

Ha, ha, hello to
you, too.

Wow.
Oh my God.

So, Gabby, on our last
girls' night here ?

Did I let you
borrow my sex video ?

Mamita, you know what
y'all were doing

is outlawed
in other countries.

I mean, how the hell did
Randy get so flexible ?

So do you have it ?
No, no.

Oh.

So Gabby, what's up
with the little tyke ?

That young man is
my boyfriend.

Right, so let me guess.

You told him you
were 39 ?

Seven.

So I guess 45
is now the new 37.

You know damn well you haven't
seen 37 in almost a decade.

And girlfriend,
what is this ?

What ?

Is that from your
daughter's closet ?

You like my boots ?

What does she think about
you dating a boy

that's just four
years older than she is ?

<i>Por favor,</i> we went to the
club the other night

on a double date.

Oh, my God, not only
are you robbing the cradle,

but you're taking it
clubbing, too ?

Look, I didn't come here so
y'all could give me a hard time.

I just wanted y'all to
meet him and be happy for me.

Listen, you guys, I need
to find this DVD.

What about Kim ?

I asked her already,
she doesn't have it.

What's the big
deal anyway ?

You can barely
see your faces.

It's the other body parts
that I'm worried about.

Look, don't worry.

Continue with
your night.

Stick to your plans.

You've got that
paper due.

Sweetie, you've
got to stay focused.

Yeah.
Yeah.

As soon as
everyone arrives,

we'll figure out where
the movie is.

Randy will never
find out, okay ?

Excuse me, ladies.

Here you go, Mami.

Gracias, Papi.

<i>Ah, te quiero mucho.</i>

<i>Y yo a ti.</i>

Oh, he is right
to call you "Mommy."

Cut it out before
he hears you.

Excuse me, young man,
I didn't get your name.

I'm Randy, Tosha's
husband.

Oh, cool, nice to meet
you, I'm Miles.

Martin-- what's up ?

Not much, being
easy, man.

True dat, true dat, I am
doing the same.

That's my wife
Andrea over here.

She-- she be easy, too.

Wow.

What do you do, man ?

Oh, what do I do ?

I'm learning to invest,
invest my money.

Oh, smart.

Do you talk with
a financial analyst,

like at Schwab or
Merrill Lynch ?

Nah, I'm meeting with my
financial professor...

yeah, over at GSU.

GSU ?
Yes.

You're a college
student.

Yeah.

So what are you, 20,
21, tops ?

No, I'm 25.

Yeah, I'm a
grad student.

So where'd you
meet Gabby ?

Ah, Gabby.

She's hot, right ?

She's beautiful.
Yeah.

Well, you know, one night,
I needed to get out, you know.

I had a long work
week, you know.

You mean-- you
mean schoolwork ?

Right, right.
Gotcha.

So you know, I crept
in this place.

The music
was bangin', you know,

everybody's having a good
time, socializing.

But I wanted
to lay back.

You know, peep the spot out for
places to post up, you know ?

Of course.

You know, for the
rest of the night.

And there she was, man.

She's looking good at the
bar waiting on a drink.

Gabby.
Gabby.

So before she had a chance
to pull out her wallet

and pay for her drink,

I whipped out the
plastic, you know ?

Instantly.

And I'm like,
"No, let me, I insist."

She was so excited,
you know Gabby.

She's like,
"Oh <i>gracias,</i> Papi."

And you know I'm like,
"It's <i>nada</i> ."

You know, "nada."

Right, right, right,
right, right

You know, in Spanish, that
means it's nothing,

you know what I mean ?

So we sat there, you
know, and we talked and chatted

until about, I say 11:00,
when the place closed.

A hopping club
closed at 11:00 ?

Club ?

We were at Starbucks.

Yeah.

The coffee place.

Yeah.

It's a great place
to meet the ladies.

And free Internet, too.

Right.

Wow.
Y'all gotta step
your game up.

Y'all are married, right ?

Y'all-- You don't know--?

I gotta get in the game.

Right.

And those cards ?

What ?

Gift cards come
in handy.

Starbucks.
Yeah.

You want something
else to drink ?

Apparently a macchiato
of some sort.

Apparently.

There's a Starbucks
on the corner, right ?

( laughing )

( Miles )
Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.

Wow.

You need--
Yeah.

Did she move or
paint her house ?

Dr. Simmons , I know you got
your eye on me now.

There it is.

Oh boy, she pretty.

Never quit.

Are you okay ?

I'm fine.

Kind of a strange
place to put a curb.

I've never seen parking
like that before.

Oh, I'm James Brown.

That's your name ?

As the Godfather
of Soul.

Hey !
Hey.

And you are ?

I'm Liz Simmons, as in
godmother of all things holy.

Shonda.

( door bell ringing )

Hey, guys.

Hey, girl.

Hi.

Oh girl, you gotta get
that driveway fixed.

What are you talking--

Don't ask.

I brought something
for tonight's special occasion.

Well, so did I.

Hot damn, that smells
like new leather.

And I'm a loner.

I don't bring sand
to the beach.

Okay.

Oh, Gabby.

Oh my God, look at you.

How long has it been ?

Oh, don't you
look beautiful.

How are you and
the boys doing ?

These last two years have
been pretty trying

to say the least.

Oh, with my beloved
Reverend Dr. Simmons

ascending into heaven,

the rightful place
next to his father.

My boys going off to school,
on their own.

Wow.

Well, I've gotten
closer to my father.

My savior.

Oh, my Jesus Christ.

He is my alpha
and my omega.

My beginning and my end,
but for his grace.

Ooh, I would not
be here, I praise him.

Ooh, I praise him, Lord,
â™ª I love the Lord

â™ª He heard my cries

Oh, Jesus, glory, thank
you God almighty !

Hello.

Oh, thank you.

Hey, James.

Hey, Andrea.

Look like you about to have that
knucklehead any moment now.

Oh yeah, trying to kick
its way out as we speak.

Gabby.

You look as
lovely as ever.

So you ready to take
a brother out ?

Yes, with my 9mm,
but it's illegal.

Why do you keep fighting ?

You know you want this.

Fellas.

Oh.

Ah-ah !

That had better
be holy water.

Be come spraying me with
no foolishness.

Well, it's not holy
but it's definitely spiritual.

Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

To you give harmony to family,
love and peace.

Now you're gonna have me
smelling like Red Hots.

You gotta excuse
her, Liz.

She's a little on edge.

What's wrong ?

Randy and I made
a sex video

and me and the
ladies watched it last week

and now I can't find it.

Oh, dear Jesus in heaven,
bless this child.

Randy's sure gonna bless her
once he finds out, <i>de verdad</i> .

Randy doesn't know ?

Oh dear Lord, please show this
woman the error of her ways.

What the hell are you
doing making a sex tape ?

Well, I was taking
an online course.

I thought it would be fun
for us to have our own movie.

Well, where's the last
place you saw it ?

Here, in our ladies'
night last week.

And neither of
you two took it ?

No.

What about Kimberly ?

You know, I wouldn't put
it past that bitch.

Watch your mouth.

Just saying.

Look, Kim definitely
doesn't have it.

Are you sure Randy
doesn't have it ?

Trust me, if Randy had
it, I would know it.

I just hope and pray that he
doesn't find it before I do.

Well, you should be in
here tearing this house up

looking for that thing.

I am, but I just don't
want Randy to think

that something is going on

so we have got
to be discreet.

Discreet ?

You should have
been discreet.

Making that old
sin-filled sex movie.

Why don't you just be
honest and just tell Randy ?

Bitch, are you crazy ?

I'm just saying.

I mean, you're already
in enough trouble.

You might as
well cut your losses.

Oh...

Ooh !

Whose little cute
nephew is that ?

He's my date.

Your date ?

That baby ain't nothing
but about 20 years old.

He's 25.

Okay, and you're 45.

Oh my God, you're over
here making these sex movies

and you're dating
Nickelodeon.

Oh Lord, I've
been gone too long.

The devil done moved
up in this house.

He's my man and
I'm his woman.

What's the big hoopla ?

We're just dating,
having fun.

<i>Y esta buenissimo</i>
<i>en la cama.</i>

What does that mean ?

That means they
have good sex.

I am thirsty.

Drink this.

Tosha, there better not be any
alcohol in this.

You know I don't let
that sin penetrate my lips.

Something penetrated
your lips.

You got two boys.

( laughing )

I'm gonna say a special
prayer for you.

You better
be lucky I'm saved.

Drink up, girl,
drink up.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, I gotta swing
by the lab, guys.

I got a project producing
catalysts for use in production.

The way you jumped up,
look like you

about to meet
a nice piece of tail.

What ?

No.

No, not a woman.

It's a computer,
filled with data.

I'll be back
in a little while.

Hey, Andy will have a shit fit
if she sees me leaving.

You care if I slip
out the back door ?

You gonna sneak out
without telling your wife ?

Man, she gonna slide your
ass on the couch

when you get
home tonight.

No, she'll be fine.

Why don't you just try
telling Andrea the truth ?

It works for Tosha
and I.

I'm gonna take my chances
with the backdoor.

Okay, my friend,
it must be important

because I've seen you
coming and going

all hours of the night.

No, I'm busy.

I hope your couch is
really comfortable.

Oh, hey, man.

I'm James Brown.

I'm Miles Whittaker.

Nice to meet you, sir.

Hi.

Miles here is
with Gabby.

My Gabby ?

Oh, you must be
with her daughter.

Terry's friend.

Actually, I'm her date,
Mr. Brown.

No.

Yeah.

Ah.

You can't be no more
than, what, 20 ?

25, sir.

Oh.

Oh, yeah, I gotta go.

I'll be back.

Okay.

Yeah, okay.

( Andy )
Where could he be going ?

Listen, you're pregnant,
you do not need this, okay ?

No, I don't need this.

But that makes
absolutely no sense.

Listen, Andy, the quicker
he leaves,

the faster he'll
return, okay, relax.

It's fine, it's fine,
I got you, okay ?

Oh, stop spraying me with
that wit that rosewater

and quit chanting.

There is no balance
in my life.

I am like a
frickin' psycho right now.

There is no harmony,
there is no peace,

and I have
questionable love,

or maybe you haven't noticed.

Okay then, damn.

<i>( Jeff )</i>
<i>You always give</i>
<i>me a hard time.</i>

I'm not doing this
with you, Jeff.

No, no, no, stop, don't
interrupt me.

Do not--

No, you've
had three months.

We've been divorced
for three months.

Get your shit out
of my house, please.

<i>You're always giving me a</i>
<i>hard time, you know that ?</i>

You should have made
the time, okay ?

You should have
made the time.

You're just doing
this to fuck with me.

You have 30 days to get
your shoes, your pants,

your cufflinks, your
little gadgets,

all that shit, I want it
out, I want it out !
<i>Yo, yo, yo, whatever.</i>

Or I swear, I
will go Angela Bassett

in "Waiting to Exhale"
on your ass.

<i>Hush.</i>

Try me !
<i>( Jeff laughing )</i>

What was that about ?

Man, I opened my heart up
to Gabby, man, and--

And she took a
bite out of it.

Yeah.

You know, in the Tantra, I was
told that sexuality is total.

It's full of bliss.

It's not about sex.

Man, what are you
talking about ?

It's obvious that Gabby
and that boy

are fucking
like jackrabbits,

but maybe, just maybe, she's
falling in love, too.

You sound like Oprah,

but you look
like Ali Baba.

( laughing )

Do I have a choice ?

Thanks, man.

You got it.

Just let it go.

God, Jesus.

He's not answering.

Who, Martin ?

No, the Pope.

Yeah, Martin.

( Gabby )
Andy, quit nagging
already.

I mean, maybe Martin
needed a break from you.

Oh shut up,
Nanny McPhee.

Isn't it time for
his nap ?

Tosha, can you please
get me some more punch.

Girl, you put your
foot in that.

Sure thing.

( Kimberly)
Oh, ugh.

Damn girl, don't you
know how to knock ?

Oh you know what,
don't even,

don't even start
with me, okay ?

I just had to hike past
three houses

'cause some beat-up
rusty old Volkswagen

is parked in my spot.

Hey, that's my
first car.

I am trying to
build my credit.

Okay...

Who is that and why
is he talking to me ?

Seriously ?

And Gabby, why the hell
are you hugged up with someone

who looks like he's
half your age ?

Because he's my
boyfriend.

Oh, God, Oh, God, please.

I can't take any more
high drama today.

Tosha, ome on, honey.

Make your girl something
strong and hard.

Please, now, please.

Guys, I'm so--

I'm just so done.

I am just so over Jeff,
he is so pompous.

( Andy )
What's he done now ?

Finding ultra-creative
ways to piss me off.

If I don't ever see him
again, it'll be too soon.

Okay, pass that to her.

Give it to me.

And here you
are, Madame.

Why the hell do you look
like Florida Evans ?

( Tosha )
Oh, we're gonna
play a little game tonight

in accordance to this course
that I'm taking.

Kama Sutra.

I'm just waiting for
everybody else to get here.

Okay, well,
everyone's here.

Okay, here we go.

Oh !

Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

To you, bring harmony
to family, love and peace.

Oh, smells like
new money to me.

You would say that.

What's her problem ?

Martin.

Oh, out of town
again, huh ?

So, sweetie,
what's your name ?

His name is Miles.

Gabby.

It looks like he has a
mouth, I think he can

speak for himself,
okay ?

So how old are you ?

25.

25, huh.

Good year.

I have a Prada stilettos
older than you.

Well, I guess the devil
really does wear Prada.

( laughing )

It's really
sad, you know.

You're that desperate that
you have to date a teen.

You should know
desperate.

Didn't Jeff leave your
trifling ass behind ?

Please.

( Tosh )
Hey-- hey, hey, hey, hey.

Play nice, ladies, okay ?

Leave it to Kim
to go for the jugular.

Oh.

Honey, don't even start
with me, knocked up, okay ?

I'm surprised Martin
even had time

to get your
little self pregnant,

seeing that he's always
working, huh ?

Oh, do not go there
with me, bitch,

'cause I am in no mood
for your bougie ass tonight.

Okay, this is
getting good.

( Tosh )
Okay, okay !

Enough, enough.

And take it easy, okay ?

You're gonna end up
having a miscarriage.

She better keep my man's
name out of her mouth.

You better keep your
finger out of my face

and put a pretzel in it.

Oh, shut up.

Listen, listen, shh !

Just peace, love !

Happiness !

Bitch.
( Kim )
Slut.

Y'all are rowdy.

Is it like this
all the time ?

Papi, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

( clicking )

What the hell
are you doing ?

I'm trying to get the
score from the games.

The only game
I'm concerned about is

what that boy is playing
with my Gabby.

All right, all right, I know
what you're gonna say,

okay, I know it, Tosha,
but that bitch, she started it.

Well, which bitch is that,

because apparently, we're all
bitches to you

and you seem to be
the only one in bitch mode.

All right,
look, I'm sorry, okay ?

I'm sorry, but I'm
stressed, Tosha.

Jeff keeps wiggling his
way back into my life,

leaving stuff in
my house purposefully

just so he'll have an excuse
to just pop back in there.

I'm just-- It's a lot.

You're stressed.
Yeah.

You said you
were stressed.

Can't you see it ?

I've got a friend out
there who's dating the boy

from the "Karate Kid" remake.

I've also got a friend
out there who's pregnant

whose husband continues
to dip out on her.

Let's not
forget about my friend

who's the freakin'
Jesus freak.

And I also have a friend who
cares more about her feelings

than anybody else's.

Not to mention...

Not to mention...
Okay.

that I have a research
paper that's due in two days

that still sits incomplete,
which, by the way,

is the reason why I'm
giving this little get-together

in order to play a game based
on love and happiness

when there's not one,
not one little ounce of--

shred of love
or happiness

coming from this household !
You know what ?

And I also have to come to
grips with the fact

that there is a
movie, a sex video,

a tape of me and
my husband

just floating around out
there somewhere in cyberspace.

I don't know where it is,
and you're telling me

that you're stressed ?

Oh, God.

Look at me, look at me.

Look at me, look at me.

Give me that !

Okay, I'm just trying to
get you to calm down.

It's too much, Tosha.

You're gonna wear
yourself out, okay ?

What is this on
my forehead ?

It's driving me nuts.

I have no idea and
it's awful,

it does not even
go with this whole ensemble.

( Andy )
So no luck, huh ?

You sure you looked
everywhere ?

I took the DVD.

Why ?

I don't know, it was there
and I wanted to see it again.

Kind of see if maybe you knew
moves that I didn't know.

Oh, that's got to be the
stupidest way

you could have
answered that question.

Okay, it's fine.

So where's the DVD now ?

I don't know.

Now, that's the stupidest way
you could have answered

that question.

I think one of my daughters
maybe got a hold of it,

I drilled them, asked them and
they said they didn't have it.

You know, they promised me
they didn't have it,

I searched the
house up and down.

Gabriella,
Gabriella, wait-- Shh !

Gabriella, just give me
a moment !

But I couldn't find it.

So you're telling me
that you stole my DVD

and then you left it where
your teenage daughters

could find it
and then you lost it

all because you didn't
want to ask me to use it ?

Because you know what ?

Had you asked me to use
it, I would have simply said no.

You know what ?

I'm lost for words.

How about that ?

Calm down, calm down.
I'm lost for words.

She gave it to her
teenage daughters.
I know, I know.

Her teenage
daughter saw it.
I know, I know.

What, did she put it on
her little Twitter account ?

You know what ?

This doesn't surprise
me, Gabriella.

This doesn't
surprise me.

So you forgive me ?

I wish...

I wish that I could have
you fucking deported right now.

Do you know what's gonna
happen if Randy finds out...
Hey, mami, that's harsh.

about that movie ?

Tosha, calm down, Tosha.
Oh my God, oh my God.

Count to ten, count to ten.
Oh my God.

Listen, sweetie,
sweetie, sweetie,

you cannot have her
deported, okay, okay ?

You could kill her,
which I would do.

I know people.

I'm sorry, Tosha.

You're sorry,
you're sorry.

I think we are so far
past an apology, Gabby.

I mean, like I said
before, you can barely tell.

You can't even see the
faces of who's in the movie.

( Miles )
Right, you can only ass
and tits.

Quick question.

How did you get both arms
and legs over your--

You let this boy
see my movie ?

No, no !

Nah, nah, shorty,
listen, listen.

She didn't let
me see anything.

Calm down, it's not
even that serious.

You can't even
see your face.

Well, how'd you
see it, boy toy ?

Look, I saw it online.

Oh !

Oh, God, oh, God !
( mouthing a prayer )

Get me a wet rag,
get me a wet rag.

Somebody get me a wet
rag, wet the towel.
I'm busy.

( Kim )
Use the spray.

( Gabby )
I shouldn't have
done that.

( Kim )
Stop... yeah, wipe
her down, wipe her down.

You're drunk, Liz.

No, I do not drink.

You don't drink ?

No, that's like...

Well, what's in that glass
you've been sipping on

for two days?

( Tosh )
Randy's gonna hear,
Randy's gonna hear.

Tosha, baby,
snap out of it.

Tosha, Tosha.

Baby, answer me.

Tosh.

You see what you did ?

Randy's gonna
divorce me.

Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.

Randy loves you.

Now, he might not
love seeing what God

blessed him with on the
computer screen.

God did bless
him, right ?

Anyway, he ain't gonna
leave you, baby.

I got the word here.

A little something
for the occasion.

( Kim )
Listen.

Randy is not gonna
find out, okay ?

We're gonna make
sure that he doesn't

get on the Internet,
all right ?

And you're
gonna make some calls

and get this thing
taken down, okay, okay.

( Andy )
Doesn't he have
an iPhone ?

Oh, oh, oh, I'll get
it, I'll get it.

Liz, be subtle.

About as subtle as the Holy
Spirit whispering in your ear.

( Kim )
Oh Lord, you need to
put that drink down.

You know, you ain't been to
church in a hot minute.

Listen, we're gonna get
everybody together, okay ?

Tosh, we're gonna play this
little game of yours,

all right ?

And that way you can make
sure that Randy

doesn't get on the
Internet, all right, okay ?

But you have got to get out
of this funk, all right,

or else he's gonna
suspect something.

Tosha, do you hear me ?

Yes, yes, you're right, you're
right, you're right.

I just have to
keep him distracted.

I could have it taken down
in the morning, right ?

Yeah.

( Andy )
Yeah, yeah.

Okay... Okay, listen
to me, Gabby.

Go to my bedroom and
disconnect the Internet.

Okay.

Please.

All right.

Man, I ain't no
player hater.

The hell does that mean ?

It means that he's
not a snitch,

he's not gonna rat
you out.

Right.... I feel you, Ma.

That means "yeah."

Oh, God.

( clicking )

Liz, what are you doing ?

Tosha needs your phone.

Tosha has a phone.

The Bible says as the man
of the house,

when your wife says
she needs your phone,

you don't ask no questions,

you just give it
to her.

Liz, what is going on ?

Give me back my phone.

No questions.

No questioning.

You got it, you got it ?

Okay, good.

( Tosh )
Oh my God.
Okay, you ready ?

Okay.
You ready ?

Yeah.
Focus on me.

Okay, here we go.

Jazz hands.

Jazz hands.

Okay.
Let's do it.

We're good.

( Kim )
All right...
Got it, girl, got it.

Should we do a toast
first, maybe ?

You don't need any
more toasting.

Look at--
you are toasted.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah !

That is my special blend.

Your special blend ?
You're just jealous.

Your special blend
has you jacked up.

Whatever, Tosha made
this for me

'cause she loves
me more than she loves you.

Baby, you still
have my phone ?

Yeah, baby, yeah.

We're about to
start the game.

You can't use your
phone anyway.

Okay, so the game is
called the Great Divide.

So why the Great Divide ?

Because it deals with
love, sex, romance and such

between the genders.

I heard love and sex,
so let's continue.

( doorbell )

Oh, let me get that.

It better be Martin.

I thought everybody
was here.

Okay.

I need a refill.

Anybody... anybody ?

So y'all gonna
leave me hanging ?

You don't need anymore.

Okay.

Hey.

Baby, who is it ?

Jeff.

Jeff as in Kimberly's
ex-husband, Jeff,

and he has the gall to
bring some hussie with him ?

Tosha, calm down.

I told him last week
about the engagement

and he said he was
gonna be out of town.

Hey, man.

Hey, Tosha.

Randy.

My goodness.

Come on.

Hi.

Hi.

This is my very, very good
friend, Evelyn Vasquez.

This is Tosha and
Randy Landry.

How you doing ?

You wouldn't know that,
'cause she closed the door

in our faces.

Well, Jeff has told me so
much about you guys.

Well, I made you guys some
taquitos, they're handmade.

They're really good.
So good, so good.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Balance your life,
elevate your mind.

Give harmony to you--

Oh, whatever.

After you, please.

Balance your mind ?

What the hell
was that about ?

I thought you said you
were gonna be out of town.

Well, trip got canceled,
so I'm here.

Who's that ?

I know.

It's hard.

Hey, hi.

It's a pleasure to meet
you all, especially you, Kim.

( laughing )

I can't say I
feel the same.

Okay, so... everybody.

( spraying )

Why don't we balance
our lives, elevate our minds.

To you, give harmony to
family, love and peace.

You know, the more you
spray that, it smells like

lotus blossoms
in the spring.

I detect a hint of musk.

( Kim )
That's so interesting,
because I detect a scent, too.

And it smells
awful like shit.

Okay, Randy, why don't you
go and escort Jeff and Evelyn

over to our bar so they can
partake in spirits.

( Randy )
Sure thing.

Thank you, baby.

Kim, relax.

Calm down.

No drama.

Okay, okay, I'm fine.

Please !
Okay, fine.

I'm trying to
elevate stuff.

You know, had I known his
trifling ass was gonna be here,

I wouldn't have come.

But I can handle
this, okay ?

I'm fine.

If he was my man, I would
have kicked her ass.

Well, that's
his ex, right ?

Still.

The last thing you want to
do is piss off a woman.

Hell knoweth no fury
like a woman scorned.

( Miles )
But why kick her ass ?

'Cause I save my
bullets for him.

You'd shoot the boy ?

Like a rabid dog.

( Andy )
You seen "Old Yeller" ?

Woof, woof, woof.

Papi, you have nothing
to worry about, okay ?

Jeff is a piece of shit.

And you're a good man.

Randy, can you start the
music, please, baby ?

Okay, Evelyn, I'll
need you to stand by Gabriella

and Jeff, I need you to
stand over by Randy.

Okay.

The object of this game
is for men to challenge women

with a clear definition
of the statements

that are written on these
marked cards in the basket.

( Andy )
That sounds like fun.

I'm sure it does...

south of the border.

Kim.

I didn't know she
spoke Spanish.

So Tosha, does this game
have anything to do

with the lavender --
you've been doing all night ?

Smell like...

... Red Hots to me.

I smelled vanilla.

( Kim )
Oh, please, y'all
are tripping.

That smells
like new money.

I could have sworn it
smells like bubble gum.

Did I hear you
say bubble gum ?

Yeah, that's
what I smell.

We both know why,
don't we, J ?

Well, if you must know, this
potion is from another country.

The purpose of
this potion

is to bring out the true
character through smell,

and obviously, all of you have
smelled something different.

Okay, so back
to the game.

You will noticed different
colored numbers

as you're picking.

The blue numbers are
questions and statements

that relate to feelings
men have about women.

And the pink numbers
represent the feelings

that women have
towards men.

The purple numbers
represent the statements of sex,

love, romance and happiness.

The group with the most
amount of points

at the end of the game

will be considered as
the stronger sex.

So, who goes first ?

Well, let's start with
the weakest link, my man Miles.

Honestly.

( Kim )
Oh.

See, you're already off
to a bad start.

He's not
your weakest link.

Okay, so what number
did you pick ?

Seven.

Dip into the pink basket,
pick a card and read it.

"Men tend to be the needy
ones in a relationship."

Now that's fake, I don't
believe that,

'cause speaking
from experience,

the women that I've dated
tend to be way more

needier than myself.

They always want
to know where you been,

who you're with, why can't
I come with you.

And that's because
they young and dumb.

I know some old and dumb
ones act that way, too.

Miles, are you
saying I'm needy ?

Aw, come on.

It's just that I feel like
some women think

that their man should
spend all the time with them.

That ain't what's up.

I didn't make you
come tonight.

You could have hung
out with your little friends.

Why do all men's friends
have to be little

like we're
still little boys ?

Oh, please, come on.

It's not our fault you guys
still want a nipple to suck on.

Jeff is no longer a
little boy anymore.

He grown up, divorced
you and moved out.

Yeah, yeah, little boy
Jeff did move on,

but here's the thing.

Jeff can't distinguish
between a mother and a woman,

especially when it comes
to a nipple to suck on.

Ooh.

You often acted like
my mother,

because you got
serious issues,

and I would know, because
I'm a professor with a PhD.

Oh my gosh, how could I forget
Mr. Scholarly person ?

And I'm sorry, is
this what, your--

Your foreign
exchange student, <i>que</i> ?

Okay, so the men have been
awarded seven points

because of Miles'
explanation.

( Randy )
Yeah, Miles.

Great start to an
easy victory.

( Liz )
Whoa, whoa.

It's ladies turn,
ladies turn.

Okay.

( Kim )
You got it, get it ?

Okay, all right.

Okay.

"Men are extremely jealous."

Oh, hell no.

Oh, hell yeah.

You guys are
possessive by nature.

Martin's always asking me
when I'm on the phone,

"Who you talking to ?"

When we go shopping,
somebody asks a question,

he feels like he has to answer
all the questions himself

and it's like he's trying
to keep me away from other men.

( James )
Stupid.

Women are more
jealous than men.

All we have to do is
glance at a woman

and they got
something to say.

Now see, James, that
antiquated attitude right there,

that's why a woman ain't glanced
at you in about a decade.

( laughing )

( Tosh)
Okay, Andy, you got one
minute left, baby.

Okay, all right.

So to sum things
up, men think that it's manly

to be possessive and jealous
and make that apparent,

but you all just look like
big, silly fools in the end.

( clapping )

Nice, sweet playin'.

Here we go... my turn.

All right, fellas ?

Ah.

"Men feel that women
are more concerned

"with a man's earning power
and social position

than love and happiness."

Well, it shouldn't really
matter how much you make

if you look this good.

I can be happy until the right
person finally comes along.

Well, he's not gonna ride
up on a white horse

or a school bus
in your case, Gabby.

Basically marriage is
as respectable as paid work,

so basically,
we're just--

What are we doing, ladies ?

We're doing our job.

That's right.
That's right.

Women used to bring more
to a relationship

than fake boobs
and head full of horse hair.

They used to bring
emotional support and insurance

that the kids they
bore were his.

I actually have to disagree with
the ladies on this one.

Here she goes.

Wait.

I believe that a woman
should follow her heart

and not just marry a man
for his checkbook.

I mean, gold-digging
is so '90s.

Backdoor prostitution
is what it is.

Oh, really, backdoor
prostitution ?

Well then you know what ?

Then you should owe me money
from that weak-ass divorce.

If we did charge, we'd
have to charge $50 a minute,

'cause they can't last more than
a minute-and-a-half.

Speak for yourself.

I'd be coughing
up thousands.

( murmuring )

â™ª

Whoa !

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa !

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh !

It looks like we've got a
tight one going on here.

( doorbell )
It's close.

Oh, let me get the door.

( laughing )

( Randy )
We got a tight one.

( Kim )
I said what ?

Hey, hey, hope I
didn't miss much... hey.

Where were you, where the hell
have you been ?

I knew you weren't
coming right back.

I went to work.
Where were you ?

I told you I
went to work, come on.
For two fucking hours ?

Yeah, I was busy.

Where-- for two hours,
I do not buy it.

You are full of shit.

Yo, Speedy Gonzales.

It's none of your
business anyway.

I don't even know why
you're even here.

All right.

Kim, what's the problem ?

J-E-F-F.

Look, you know something ?

You've always given
me a hard time, you know that ?

And that shit you're doing
with my clothes,

that's just
plain ridiculous.

Yeah, that was
pretty stupid.

Why would you burn
good quality clothes ?

Obviously you
need the money.

Excuse me,
what was that ?

What did you just say
to me ?

Obviously, you
need the money.

Oh, really ?

Sweetie, no, I don't
need the money

and at least
I know about quality.

You run around here with
that tired old piece

of the motherland.

Okay, yeah, why don't you
and your little <i>taquitos</i>

roll up out of here ?

<i>Mira</i> , it's pronounced
<i>"taquito,"</i> just for me.

Hey, hey, hey, hey--
All right-- Kim !

You know what ?

You little prostitute.

I don't need to know
how it's pronounced.

Prostitute ?
Yeah.

All right, with your
tutu on right now.

Oh honey, with
your little--

Really-- I don't know
what that little--

What you wear,
what you wear !

Look, look, Evelyn--
Evelyn--

What is that,
what is that ?

Hey, hey, hey-- <i>callate</i> !

Kim, please, I don't
want to hear it.

I don't
want to hear it.

( yelling )

Take your geisha girl and her
two-for-one dress outta here.

Fine, fine.

Are you serious ?

Your toes need to catch up
with your shoes, honey.

Okay, you know what,
that's it, I'm getting my A

and my $200 from you by
tomorrow,

if not, I'm telling
the dean everything.

Everything.

You were paying
her, man ?

Oh man, I'm gonna have to
confiscate your player's card.

No more freebies
for you, okay ?

What ?

No, no, crazy lady.

Tell your broke-ass husband to
stay away from our club,

how about that ?

Take care of him
at home, <i>mami</i> .

Broke ass ?

Did you just--

Oh !

Okay, all right,
all right, whoa !

All right, all right,
all right !

We're going, we're going !

Goodbye, we're going !

All right, we're
going, bye !

All right, all
right, all right !

Hey, hey, hey, hey !

Coffee, coffee !

Great time.

( Liz )
Don't you bring her
back here again.

Don't you bring her
back here again.

I'll Pray for you !

Go !

No, you
bring me over here--

Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.

Evelyn, you're an
educated woman.

I'm done-- no, I'm done
and I want my $200.
Get in the car, please.

I'm done.

Open the fucking car door?

It's open, it's open.

Stop cursing.

Some bullshit ass got me
over here,

getting my ass whipped--

Okay, everybody, back
in the living room.

Martin, who was that ?

I have no idea.

( Randy )
Okay, everybody
back in the room.

You have no idea ?
I have no idea.

Why does she think she
knows you like that ?

I look like a
lot of people.

I can't believe this...
Babe, please, please.

Martin, I swear to God.

Everybody back in the
living room, please.

This whole night...

All right.

Tss, tss, hey, where are
you going ?

Gabby, I--

I can't do this
with you.

This is how it is ?

I can't handle this.

Gabby, I'm not lying
to you anymore.

You know what, I'm 19.

Goddamn, I knew his
ass wasn't no 25.

19 ?

You've been lying to
me this whole time ?

No, you been lying to
me this whole time.

In here flirting
with Eddie Kane, Jr.

Y'all motherfuckers
crazy, man.

Eddie Kane ?

You sitting up here,
you're talking about

whipping ass
and shooting people.

We're done.

<i>Enanito de</i>
<i>mierda, mamon.</i>

You can't even
handle this.

That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah ?

You got this gold-digger
right here,

this crazy-ass
white chick,

not to mention your
manslaughtering ass,

drunken Jesus freak and
a straight-up freak.

What the fuck
you just say ?

No.

If I were you, I would check all
those porn sites right now,

'cause your wife probably
fucked every Kama Sutra

in the business.

What ?
Everybody, just--

Balance your life.

Elevate your mind.

Fuck this shit, you
adolescent motherfucker !

Are you--

Yeah, that's right.

You can walk your
punk-ass home.

Oh, and you
are a player hater.

What was this talk about
being a freak and porn sites ?

Nothing, baby.

Tosha, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

What was he talking about
when he said porn sites

Hot damn !

That's my ass.

No, it's not.

Well, that's your ass, so
that damn well better be my ass.

Baby, it's not.

That is my ass.

That-- I know my ass like the
back of my hand.

Do you know how much time
I spend looking at myself

in the mirror ?

How did you get your legs
around your head like that ?

Maybe we should go.

Oh... oh...

Does anybody mind
making a pit stop ?

We could take my Benz?

I think everybody should
be able to fit.

I'm the only one
ain't been drinking.

Oh my God, no, you're
not driving me.

Where are--

Who's got the keys ?

Give me those
fucking keys.

What-- I'm coming.

( siren blaring )

( Gabby )
Okay, yeah.

All right.

Hi, hi, yeah, excuse me, hi.

Okay, we have a pregnant woman
who is about to bust, okay ?

And her husband's
already been busted,

you know what I'm
saying, girl ?

Sister ?

Can we roll ?

Okay, ma'am, there's a
waiting room over here.

You can take a seat and
somebody will get to you.

Waiting room ?

Okay.

You know what, um, apparently
you didn't hear me, sister.

Why don't you turn up your
little Miracle Ear, okay ?

And get us a room !

Come on, country
girl, come on... Please.

Are you getting
loud with me ?

Of course I'm getting
loud with you.

We need a room.

They do not pay me enough
money to deal with streetwalkers

coming in here talking
any kind of way.

Clearly, you, sister, with
that wig sitting

three inches
from your scalp,

you know all
about streetwalking.

Don't have me pull
Esmerelda off.

Okay guys, come
on, come on !

We gotta
baby going come.

Oh Lord, we gonna
have a baby !

It'll be all right !

We got a baby on
the way.

( excited chattering )

Hallelujah, Lord, a baby !

Hallelujah, hallelujah !

Uh-uh, uh--
Oh, wait a second.

Only patients allowed
from this point on.

Oh, no, no, no, but
these are our friends.

I'm sorry.

Hold on, hold
on, hold on.

Like she said, those
are our friends.

Can I ask you something ?

Yes.

You got a boyfriend.

Really ?

Oh, okay--

There's a waiting
area outside,

you guys are welcome
to wait in the area.

What's wrong with the
sisters in this hospitals ?

The sisters ?
Yeah, the sisters,
sister.

There.
You know what ?

The Lord said
we can be up in here.

I'mma pray for you.

Oh God.

Oh, I don't-- It just hurts.

I need something.

Ma'am, ma'am, is this
man your husband ?

Give me drugs !

Oh, oh !

Okay, let's get
her on the bed.

Martin, Martin...

You okay, Andrea,
you okay ?

You son of a bitch,
you did this to me !

Your bachelor days
are over, dude !

Get up and watch the
goddamn birth of your child !

Get up there !

( man )
Okay, let's get
her on the bed.

Let's get her
on the bed, come on.

Do you have any drugs ?

I need something,
it hurts.

You okay, baby ?

It's gonna be okay.

Okay, okay.

Tosha, you have five
seconds to tell me why

I was looking at
our naked bodies on my iPhone.

Okay.

Well, baby, do you realize
that there are more

divorced people
in this country

than there
are married people ?

And half of those marriages fail
because of bad sex lives.

There's nothing wrong
with our sex life.

Well, maybe now
that the rest of the world

has seen our sex life.

Baby, I just wanted to
keep us intimate,

which is really why I
took that online course anyway.

Which is one of the reasons
why I had us play

that stupid
game tonight.

And what does that have to do
with a freaking sex movie ?

Because I just
learned it in class.

Baby, I swear to you, that
tape was just meant for us.

And Kim and Andrea and
Gabrielle and Liz ?

No-- No, no, no, no, no.

Liz did not see it.

Baby, baby, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry, I just--

I just wanted
to help us.

And you wanted your
friends to see for what ?

Maybe I just
wanted to...

gloat.

Just a little.

I should have never bought
you that damn camera.

Now can I have a
little bitty kiss ?

No, you're on
punishment.

What's wrong with you ?

Everyone here
with the O'Neils ?

( Tosh )
Yes, yes.

Excuse me, are
you with someone ?

Well, it's a boy.

Aw !

Hot damn, I guess the stronger
sex tonight were the men !

And a girl.

Ha-- must have
been a tie.

Oh, twins !

Twins !
Twins.

They're twins, oh !

Oh my God, I knew it.

Wow!

Well, I'll see
you all later.

Oh, thank you,
Doctor.

Excuse me, excuse
me, Doctor, excuse me.

That's so sweet.

( all )
Oh....

God did good,
God did good.

But I'm gonna say a
special prayer for this one.

( Liz )
The girl or the boy ?

The girl's over there...
hey baby.

( Kim )
And the other one.

Great job.

I didn't know what I was
gonna do with the one.

Two.

No more late nights, baby.
no more late nights.

So cute.

Hey...

We'll see you.

Good work, baby.

( Liz )
Give her kisses
for us.

No more late nights.

Little prayer for my baby,
little prayer for my baby.

I'm gonna ask the Lord.

You did it, man.

They did a good job.

Excuse me, Doctor...

Feelgood.

Oh-- Dr. Feelgood.

I just wanted to--
Oh God.

Whoa, whoa.

I'm so sorry, wow.

It's been a long day.

You need an appointment ?

Actually, I happen to need
my vitals checked.

I feel a little hot.

We have a room--
I'm just joking.

Oh-- A room.

You move fast, don't you ?

Don't joke with me.

I'm joking-- Get it ?

Oh God.

Okay.

Hope you don't
mind me sitting.

All the seats are taken.

I'm Miles.

Lolita.

Lolita, nice to meet you.

How you doing ?

Good, how are you ?
I'm fine.

Actually, I'm--

I'm not fine.

Just going through a
few things, you know ?

Just going through
a breakup.

She's a lot older
than I am, you know.

And I don't think she
understands me.

You know what, I think
I should have dated someone,

you know, closer
to my age.

You know, someone
I can grow with.

Maybe someone like--
someone like you.

Oh, I was just leaving,
but good luck with everything.

Wait, wait-- Wait, I wasn't
finished talking.

Where you going ?

She's leaving me with...

... little-ass kids.

Old ass women.

Andrea.

You did so good.

You did so good,
look at this.

It's amazing.

There's two of 'em.

I know.

Oh my God--
I am so sorry.

I love you, Martin.

I love you, too,
I love you, too.

Hey, I love you, too...
Hello.

Hey big guy, we
love you too.

Oh, everybody...
we love everybody.

Oh my God, amazing.

Hello.

( laughing )

Two, two.

I don't know how
the hell...

I'm so not jealous.

Hey, hey, same
time next week ?

Not if I can
help it.

Goodbye.

All right, girl.

Call me next
week, I'll let you know

how my date with
Dr. Feelgood went.

Girl, a prayer for
you and all y'all.

No, we gonna
pray for you.

The power of prayer.

Oh, baby, I'm tired.

Sweetie, let's go home.

Is that for me ?

Well, I'm sure the hell
not gonna drink it.

Caffeine.

Gabby, why did you
turn around and--

I don't do hospitals.

My father passed away in
a hospital and I can't do it.

I understand.

So they're twins.

Twins-- Wow, that's
great, twins.

A boy and a girl.

Gabby.

Why are you intent on
denying the fact

that I've always
had feelings for you ?

James, you're
not my type.

Aw, come on, Gabby,
and that kid is ?

You're a ladies' man,
a player, you know.

I need something more.

I need stability.

Gabby, can I tell
you something ?

Mm-hmm.

I was with this
girl once, right, and...

James.

Hold on, Gabby, Gabby, no,
Gabby, stop.

Come on, Gabby.

Just hear me out, okay ?

I was with this
girl once.

And we were living
together, the whole nine yards.

Every time I would
come home from work,

she would always have
dinner cooking.

But this one day that
I got home, I came home early.

That was the day that I
got laid off.

I was trying to figure out
how I was gonna tell this woman

that I loved so very much that
I didn't have a job anymore.

So I...

I drove in the driveway,
my eyes still wet from crying.

I didn't know what I was
gonna tell her.

I walked in the house,
didn't smell nothing cooking.

Then I remembered,
I was home early.

So I went looking for her.

I walked up to the
bedroom, I opened the door.

I...

I saw the woman that
I loved so much

riding another guy.

A guy that I never seen
before in my life.

Come to find out it
wasn't the first time.

She had a little business
going on on the side,

guys coming in and out,

carrying on and going on
their merry way.

So what did you do ?

I...

I just left.

Look, Gabby.

I just want you to know,
I was hurting.

And I'm not
this insensitive guy

that everybody thinks
that I am.

I hurt, too.

You know, I'm so done with the
whole club scene after tonight.

Really done.

But, um...

maybe we can hook up
for a cup of coffee sometime.

Really ?

I'll walk a mile to a Starbucks
just to hang out with Gabby.

Just for future reference,

don't ever use the word
"miles" and "Starbucks"

in the same sentence,
ever again.

Okay.

Go ?

What time is it ?

It's 3:00 a.m.

Mm-hmm.

Witching hour.

I can't believe you were
worried about our sex life.

Never again, baby.

I promise.

It's the witching
hour, huh ?

Yep.

Then why don't we
get a little wicked ?

Mmm.

Wait-- Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

One more thing.

â™ª

Hey, how y'all doing ?

How are you ?

I'm fine,
I'm all right.

How you doing, brother ?

I need a woman's--

I need to talk to a
woman for a second.

I just need to
get some advice.

I'm going through a
breakup right now.

Yeah, I like your 'do.

Oh, what it do ?

Yeah, it does.

Listen, if you don't mind,
can we step outside

and talk, brother ?

I was trying to get
some bus routes.

You're a motor-- Motor coach
operator, ain't you ?

Yeah.

Yeah, just-- What time the
St. Bernard passing ?

The Broad ?

Right now.
Right now ?

Praise God, brother.

All right.

All right.

Drink this.

Drink it.

Please.

( man )
Cut.

Action on the leading line.

( Gabby )
I didn't make you
come here tonight.

No, it's yours first.

What's wrong with you ?

( man )
One more time, I like that,
I like that.

Here we go and...

Hold on, this goddamn
bindi shit.

I'mma burn this shit
once this movie is over.

We're gonna have a celebration
burning and shit.

( yelling )

<i>Callate, Callate,</i>
<i>Callate !</i>

Stop.

( laughing )
