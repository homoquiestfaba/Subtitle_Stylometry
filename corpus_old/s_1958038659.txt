One 1,000, two 1,000, three...


[thunder continues]

Here, put this on.

[heart beating]


[heart continues beating]

One day, your mom and I
are gonna build one for that.

[boy] Are you ever scared?
[man] Nah.

When you do something you love,

there's nothing to be afraid of.

[Gary over radio]

[man laughs]

Hey, hey, hey.

We got two of them.

We're gonna figure out some
kind of seating arrangement.

Sorry, Mr. Brody. I brought my classmate.
I hope that's all right.

Your funeral.

And you're in
Long Horn Country now.

[thunder crashes]

Everything's bigger in Texas.

Roy...
[Roy] Yeah.

You take the lead.


I'll ride with these guys.

[Roy] All right, go ahead.
[Jacob] Yup.

Do you understand?

<i>He's chasing the storm,
I'm chasing him.</i>


What's your twenty?

[reporter indistinct over TV]

<i>You are not

Tell my husband

Dad!

[beeps] <i>-</i> Bill, you

We are not pulling

Bill, north now.
[Roy] <i>Stop!</i>

She's cutting you off.</i>

<i>- Floor it!</i>
[beeping]


<i>It's the type of storm

[Roy] <i>We're looking to southwest...</i>

Bill!

[police chatter continues]

We found one kid
about 200 yards that way.

We're still looking
for the other.

He most likely
had his seatbelt on.

[phone vibrating]

[phone continues vibrating]






[vacuum whirrs]

I just mopped that.

We've gotta get going.

We're gonna fall behind.

[Quinn sighs]

[water dripping]

[water runs]

[dryer whirrs]

[dryer beeps]

You all done up here?

[door creaks]

What about the second load?

[heavy footsteps]

I don't want her to see me here.

[heavy footsteps]

Please, Mom.

[birds chirp]

Come on, Mom. Let's go.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Quinn exhales]

Are you wearing lipstick?

What? No.

I gotta get eggs
when we get home.

Don't worry about it.

Now, I'm gonna be late.
Ah, that's my boy.

[engine struggles]
Aye.

Oh, great.

You know it always
takes two tries.

[engine starts]
There we go.

Yeah.

[horn beeps]
[William] Don't do that.

[dramatic music plays]

[thunder rumbles]

[electricity whirrs]

[thunder rumbles]

[dramatic music continues]

[indistinct chatter]

Oh, my God.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can...

Okay, okay.

Okay, class, don't forget,

thermodynamic packets are due when?
[laughter]

[thunder rumbles]
End of the week, all right?

If you guys
would like to procrastinate,

I'll give you
four days to do this.

You started yet?
[teacher] Come on.

Nearly done.
Serious?

[chuckles]
If you help me with mine,

I'll give you
another driving lesson.

Deal.

[clears throat]
William Brody,

could you please escort
this officer to your locker?

[chair scrapes]

She asked for this.

what she's looking for.

Please stay seated until
Mr. Keaton's ready for you.

He was being sure.

[thunder crashes]

[dynamic music playing]

[secretary] Hey!
William Brody!

Okay. Temperature conversion,

it's in the packet,
it's important.

Make sure that y...

[dynamic music continues]

What is that?
It's Brody.

Yeah, that's him.
Oh, my gosh.

[indistinct chatter]

[thunder roars]


[male student] Does Brody think
he's Spider-Man?


[device powers down]

[thunder roars]

Why's he still up there?

[student 2] He's gonna
get hit by lightning.

Oh, my God. Is he doing...
[thunder roars]

[device whirrs]

[girl] I told you he's crazy.
He is so...

[thunder roars]

So you thought
it would be a good idea

to get up on the roof

in the middle of a thunderstorm,

turn this thing on
and see what happens?

It's what Dad did.

Dad didn't go to college.

It's just a microphone.

How would you know if it works?

I'm not going to be
the reason you get expelled.

College is your way out,
you understand?

Do you understand?

Will...

[footsteps receding]

[door closes]
For god's sake.

[dramatic music plays]

[engine revs]

[brakes squeal]

I can't do this.

It's all about timing.

This is why people
have automatics.

Okay.

When I squeeze,

I want you to give it gas. Okay?

Yeah.

[gear shifts]

[engine revving]

See? You did it.


Whoa, we're moving. [chuckles]

[Harper] We're moving. Okay.
[William] Yeah.

[Harper] Okay, nice and slow.
[William laughs]

Turn, turn, turn...

And come to a stop.
[tire squeaks]

[William gasps]

It worked.

Can I ask you a question?

Who goes out onto a roof
to get close to the sky?

[engine rumbles]

Do you ever think about
where you go when you die?

[sighs deeply]

[tires screech] - [William] This is
not stopping. This is not stopping!

Harper, I'm... I'm so sorry.

Don't sweat it. It's okay.
Shit.

You got a pen pal in Texas?

[soft music playing]


Hey.

Come here. Check this out.

My dad was a genius.

She never understood him.

Maybe you don't understand her.

When I lost my mom...

that's when I realized how
important she was to my dad.

[door opens]

[door closes]
[Quinn] Hey! I have take-out.

Hey, hey.
Mom, did you know about this?

He kept such detailed notes.
Where did you get that?

Does it-does it matter? I mean,
you could use it for your research.

Harper. I think it's time
for Harper to go.

Hey, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. No.

What are you so upset about?

This is the best chance I've
ever had at understanding Dad.


I miss him every bit
as much as you do, Will,

but that book,
that book is not for you.

You are better than...
Hey, hey, what the hell?

Better than what?

The man who got
all your research tested?

And that's why you gave up
on fieldwork, right?

Too much of a chicken shit
to put yourself in real danger?

No, Will. gave up fieldwork
to be your mother.

And sometimes
it's okay to be afraid

because I am standing
here and he's not.

When you do something you love,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

Yeah, yeah. I heard that before.

Thanks to you,
I have no idea who my dad was.

I think I'll leave, actually.

Oh... yeah.

[pensive music plays]

[car engine revs]

[music continues]

[knocks on door]
[Quinn] Will, honey?

Will, you awake?

Will?

[line rings]

[Will's phone rings]

Oh, for the love of God.

[dramatic music playing]

Thank you, sir.

[indistinct conversation
over radio]

[dog barks]

[wind chimes tinkling]

[car door opens]

[suspenseful music plays]

[suspenseful music intensifies]

[gun cocks]

State your name and business.

Uncle Roy?

I knew I shouldn't have
put a return address.

Hey, wait!

How the hell did you
even get here anyway?

I just took a few...

And what in the world has that
woman been feeding you, huh?

You know what?
Never mind, the less know...

Let me guess, you came
to be a storm chaser

just like your dad.

No, I never
really thought about it.

Yeah, I bet you didn't.

Does your mom know you're here?

I'm guessing not.

She's the reason I'm here.

She really never
talks about him anymore.

So I started reading
through the journal...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

The journal
wasn't an invitation.

I'm not your parent.
I'm not even really your uncle.

Your dad...

There was no one like him.

Never will be. Including you.

There. That's the speech.

She cleans houses, Roy.

The smartest woman
you've ever met cleans houses.

I can't babysit you, kid.
It is primetime storm season

and now I make a living
babysitting tourists,

and... and idiots.

Idiot tourists, worst of all.

But here, I'll tell you what.

Here. Ticket home, it's on me.

And then, if your mom asks,

here, you couldn't find me
or... or I'm dead.

You pick.

[engine starts]


[door opens]

[Roy] Van is way bigger than you.
[William] Barely.

[dramatic music plays]


[Roy mutters indistinctly]

You so much as breathe on me,
I will shoot you.

Here, check this out.


<i>All that heating at 90 degrees</i>

<i>cooking all that moisture.</i>

You can't get out of the pot.

Once that cap goes away,
it explodes.

Then you kick in
the low-level jet. Bingo.

What's this do?

for emergencies.

Is it legal?
No, not-not exactly.

and he doesn't have his phone.

So I'm sure he's gonna
be back before dark.

If he ain't here by sundown,

then we'll officially designate
him a missing person.

Start an investigation.

So what am I supposed to do now?

All you can do is wait.

[dramatic music playing]

[music swelling]

Son of a...

[vehicle approaches]

It's about damn time.

Hey, remember this.

Please, you are not
William Brody.

Not today. You stay put.

[car door opens, closes]


Yeah. Good morning.
Good morning. Finally.

Good morning, Chuck.

Remember, today's the last day
to get your merchandise.

[Chuck[ Yeah, no thanks.
You guys charge too much.

We take cash.

We take PayPal. We take...
Are we gonna see a tornado?

[phone rings]

Roy speaking. - [Quinn]
H<i>e's with you, isn't he?</i>

<i>- </i> Yeah.
<i>- </i> Where are you, Roy?

I'm getting in the car.

It's, uh...
it's our last day today, Quinn.

I'll... I'll get him home.

<i>Just know that he's safe, okay?</i>

There is no place in that
entire time zone

<i>that's safe this
time of year, Roy.</i>

<i>Where's the target?</i>

Call you back.

[intense music]


Plan the wedding for winter.

Then your wife's happy

'cause you'll never risk
missing your anniversary

for chase season.

You lost?

That's my nephew.
He's just here for the night.

You're paying for his seat?

We're not running
a charity here.

Paperwork.

Just sign this.

It says consent of
the parent or guardian...

For god's sake,
just sign the damn thing.

He doesn't talk,
his name isn't on the manifest.

He was never here.

Let's go.

[clears throat]

Ladies and gentlemen,

please keep your arms
and your legs

inside the vehicle at all times.

Thank you.

Don't break anything.


You better buckle up.
We got an enhanced risk today.

So true.

[engine struggles]

[engine struggles]



He's not here, is he?

We... [clears throat]

Well, let me come with.
I can help.

You're a kid. Go home. No.

[engine struggles]

[engine stops]


[engine revs]

[tires squeal]

[dynamic music plays]


It's a whole place.

They get storms there, too.

[William] Lightning capital of the world.

I wouldn't call them storms.
More like afternoon showers.

You're gonna get
an education today, kid.

more about meteorology

than you'll ever know.

[Zane] Him?
[Roy] Yeah.

All right, kid.

Explain to me where
we're going today and why.

May I?


dry line's
over the Texas Panhandle.

If dew points rise, converging
winds should set things off

in a few hours.

Should be an explosive day.

But, uh, I'm sure
you all knew that.

Kid's a genius.


You want to bust my balls?

Let's try it again
when we're in chaos.

Finding the finger of God
inside of a target zone

over 100,000 miles...

that's what we do.

We do follow three rules.

Rule number one:

always make sure you got
at least a half a tank of gas.

Rule number two:
always, always, always

make sure you got an escape.

Generally, these storms
move to the east and the north.

Wait, why "generally?"

It's just typical.
It's not hard and fast.

The goal is to target
the southeast corner of a cell

and to lead it.

That way,
all you got to worry about

is driving east and south
to get out of its way.

Find yourself
having to improvise

and you're already in trouble.

So what's rule number three?

[ominous music plays]

Never get caught
in the Bear's Cage.

Never get caught in the vault.
[chuckles] Mm-hmm.

are rain-wrapped.

You won't see nothing
until you're...

30 feet in the sky.

No, sir.

Your first time?

So, uh, what happens if you get
caught in the Bear's Cage?

You better find
a ditch or a pool.

Ha! Bring your sunblock
and your swim trunks,

if you dare.

[music intensifies]

Hey, chasin' is
90 percent driving

and 10 percent witnessing
the Creator's wrath.

I pride myself on
getting closer to the heat

than any other tour company.

When you kiss it
right on the mouth.


So what's the deal
with the thing?

What thing?

It looked like a bomb.
Will took it up on the roof.

Not a bomb.

Not a bomb.

It can save lives.

So what's the deal
with you and Will?

He thought you were pretty
since the third grade.


That's not it.

You treat him good.

I... I like the way
that he looks at the sky.

It... it's fine.
I...

If you're gonna smoke,
it's fine.

I'll save it or later.


pretty quick.

It's telling me
it's ten miles out.

I can't see shit.

Just wait till
we clear the rocks.

Okay, once we clear the canyon,

that's when you're gonna
want to pull out your cameras.

Can I help you?

[engine revving]

[intense music plays]

[tires squeal]

What are you doing, boy?

It's absolutely massive.

Get back there
before it starts moving.

Like having a puppy in the car.

Do you want to get me fired?

God Almighty.

[indistinct chatter]

pull over here, right here.

You sure?
There's no pavement there.

I'm sure.
Okay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
What, Frank? What are you gonna do?

Don't park in the grass.

Get off the grass, Zane.
You piece of shit.

Blow that out your ass, Frank.

[horses neighing]

Remember,
stay away from the road.

Stay tight as a group.
And when I say we go, we go.

And hey, [laughs]
enjoy the show.

Keep him on a leash.

[excited chatter]

[car door closes]
[man] Finally.

[sweeping music]

See how the anvil blasts
miles out over the horizon?

[wind blows]

You feel that?

That cool breeze?
You feel it?

Yeah, that's her outflow.

I don't remember them
being this big.


Well, they get bigger.

You got yourself
a classic Supercell right there.

You can see her rotating from
the wall cloud below the base

all the way up her updraft.

Now... when the wind
turns warm from the back,

that's when she's feeding,

growing toward you.

I should have brought my phone.


Hey, Chuck,
you're boning my shot.

[music intensifies]

Keep your eye on that funnel!
This thing is happening.

Right now, it's just a funnel.

But watch.

Watch. Watch the ground beneath.

Soon as you see
debris kick up...

you got yourself
a bona fide tornado.

[music swelling]

It's real.

Wow.

This is gonna buy me a Rolex.

Why aren't we closer?

We got the best seat
in the house.

Being in the front row
just gets you killed.

[thunder crashes] - The cell
to the south is choking her off.


[man 1] Come on.
[man 2] Let's go!

Let's go!
Everybody in the van!

Big winds on the way.
[horses neighing]

Let's go! Let's go! Get in!


[engine starts]

Shit.

[thunder rumbles] - [Roy] I'm gunning it.
It's not moving.

Give it a rest.

[emergency alarm beeping]

Hail core's about
to pass overhead.


Two inches?

[thudding continues]

Three and a half.

[alarm beeping]

Is it bad?

It's real bad.

[intense thudding]

[thudding calms]

Everybody okay?

Is that a yes?!

[Chuck] Yeah. We're okay.
[whooping]

You just experienced
gorilla hail. Ha-ha.

You're welcome.

[car door opens]
[whimpers]

the size of the hail?

That's what we get
for going off the pavement.

Storage is just over
the state line from Shamrock.

to get the other van?

chase before sundown.

Hey, listen,
I want to talk to you.

I think we can get
our money back.

Hey, don't even
think about it, Chuck.

You're not getting your money back.

You signed a waiver, remember?

Hey, was hat a tornado?

If it was,
we'd be deader than dead.

guys are still in Panhandle?

<i>We'll be in Liberal tonight.</i>

<i>- </i> Kansas?
<i>- </i> Yeah, that's the one.

<i>I should be there by lunch.</i>

You're, uh...

you're not mad at me, are you?
He ambushed me.

<i>You have my only kid, Roy.</i>

He doesn't know
how dangerous this world is.

He's in good hands.

Where are you coming from?

Right. I'll be in touch.

Hey, buddy.
Hi. [chuckles]

If you want to hit on somebody,

why don't you hit on
someone your age, eh?

You got a smoke?

Oh, thanks, man.

Lighter.

Trade that.
Gentlemen shouldn't smoke.

I was just playing around.
Where are you going?

You ever been to Kansas,
Dorothy?

[pensive music]

[pensive music continues]

Why didn't he listen to you?

Well, Zane's changed.

Every time you sell
one of those trucker hats

with our name on it,

does my mom get a cut?


Yeah.

I already knew
the answer to that.


one of the things
I loved most about your dad?

How he could...

He could look up at the sky
and know...

everything he needed to know.

He didn't need
some radar on his phone.

Nowadays, you download some app,

run a car,
you call yourself a chaser.

got to do with anything?

Right after we lost your dad,

your mom was
forced to bankrupt the lab.

Brody Storm Labs eventually
became Brody Storm Tours...

And here we are.


You really needed
that guy as a partner?


Do I look like a partner?

Huh? I'm an employee.

Hey...

I gotta eat.

So do we.

Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
If it helps...

your name is
the only reason it's still here.

[dramatic music plays]

It has value.
It means something.

Yeah. That some crazy asshole
got two students killed.

We gotta go.

[sweeping music playing]

Come on!

[music intensifies]

See that wall of cloud?

Wait, that one?

You dumb son of a bitch,
that one right there.


Round the place.

There's Cornshit.

Hurry up.

Get the mask.
Put them inside. Let's go.

[man 2]
Okay, all right. Start it up.

Took you long enough.

Pulled a two-hour turn around.
Okay, kid. Get out.

You change his diapers?

Chuck is really startin' to
piss me off this year.

[thunder rumbling]

[bell jingles]
[woman] Daphne, you hear me?

Put it down.
You don't need that.

You only get one.
You hear me? One.

[crowd clamoring]

[tires screech]

[tires screech]

[thunder rumbling]

That's us. Let's go.

Where's the kid?

I don't know.
We gotta go, man.

[indistinct chatter on radio]


[emergency alert on radio]

[man on radio] <i>The National
Weather Service in Warren Town</i>

<i>has issued
a Tornado warning for:</i>

<i>Anderson County, Norton County,</i>

<i>Bolton County, Warren County...

Hey, man. You got the time?

<i>A severe thunderstorm

<i>five miles northwest.</i>


Look, he's safer here anyway.
We can come back for him.

We'll be leaving in
just a moment, folks. Yeah.

There's one person in there,
a there's a whole bunch here.

This is not a choice;
I will fire you.

[engine starts]

[man on radio]
<i>for potential shelter...</i>

If it was headed this way,

all those chasers
would still be here.

[bell chimes]

[wind blows]

[thunder rumbles]


Lock it.

[tornado siren blares]

Shelter.

[siren continues]

[dial tone]

This isn't a shelter.

No, no, no!

[phone line beeps]


[line beeps]

[siren fades]



Your nephew's got a horseshoe
stuck up is ass.

Probably make
the seven o'clock news.

That'd be good.

[tires screech]

We're here with the son of
the legendary Storm Chaser

Bill Brody, who just survived

the Shamrock tornado
in a phone booth.

Tell us what
happened here today.

Well, yeah. Well, I-I was...

Hey, everybody. I'm Zane Rogers,

proud owner of
the Brody Storm Tours Company.

William Brody here is set to
join the family business and...

And carry on his father's work.
Am I right, son?

What the hell are you doing?
Hey, you're interrupting me.

You may have been able
to buy the Brody name,

but you will never be Bill Brody.
Oh, really?

Aren't you the one that turned
his father into a hood ornament?

Yeah.

We are the premier
tour company in this area.

Hope you realize
we've been doing this

for probably nigh on about 20...

[grunts]
[crowd gasps]


You can fire me now.

Hurry, hurry. Set up the shots.

[camera shutters clicking]
[man] Hold on. Hold on.

[man 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[laughs]
[man] Zoom in on him.

Where the hell were you?
Huh? What?

You know what I'm talking about.

Do you have any idea
how scared I was?

I just wanted some popcorn.

You think this is a game?

No.

Then why'd you send me this?

What? What use is it to me?

I thought it was a nice gesture.

No, that's bullshit.

No, you need me.


The hell I do.
What do I need with a kid?

I'll show you.

[dynamic music plays]

I'll be damned.

She did it.

I got to charge it tonight, but...

I found it.

Found-found what?

Mom. She cracked it.

All this time...

Now we can hear it
coming from miles away.


Wait.

Hey.

Wow.
[Roy chuckles]

[music continues]

Go on. Get in.

I can almost smell him.

My dad, his hands were so big.

I'd stare at them for hours
while he drove.

I'd wonder if mine
would look like that.

That's what makes you a man.

To be honest, Will,
I don't think that

has anything to do with it.

Hey, slide over.

Where are we going?
Oh, you'll see.

[car approaching]

[thunder rumbling]

Keep your eyes on the radar.

I'll watch the road.

You got a girl?

Yeah? Is she cute?

She's smart.

That's what I like.


Since the seventh grade.

[rain falls]

[thunder booms]

All right,
we're through it in no time.

How long you two been dating?

I don't know.

We're just friends.

That won't keep.

You're a Brody.

[engine stops]

All right. You ready?

[thunder rumbles]

Welcome to
the backside of a Supercell.


This is unbelievable.


You think
I'll ever see him again?

I mean...

when it's over for me, too.

Do you think so?

I'm not much of
the spiritual type. But...

I'll tell you what.

There was this, uh...

old lady in... in Shamrock.

Back in '77, and she told me...

she left for the bank one day,

and, um, she forgot her paycheck
on the dining room table.

That day, a tornado
took her home, everything,

everything was gone.

The fridge had been tossed about
two miles on the other side of 1-40.

The only thing left standing...

was that dining table,
with the check still on it.

[William chuckles]

anything I've learned

from all of this, it's...

any law you got,

it will defy it.

So yeah.

Yeah, I think
you'll see your dad again.

Well, uh...

Mom won't be
cleaning houses much longer.

I'll make sure of that.

you something you haven't seen.

It's why we feel the way we do
the morning of a chase.

For me...

well, that's the end of it.

Well, I'm just getting started.

[sweeping music]

Woo-hooo!

Whoo! Whooo!

Whoo-hoo!
[William laughs]

You know, Will made me watch
every episode of <i>Storm Chasers.</i>

That must have been painful.

Why'd you let them film you?

Bill thought...

that if we raised our profile,

people would
open up their pocketbooks.

He was right.

You're lucky, Harper.

Money solves a lot of problems.

If I could, I'd trade it all

for my dad to come
watch me play soccer.

You know, a long time ago,

Bill introduced me to the sky,
and I fell in love with him.

He also used my science in a
whole bunch of different ways

that nobody ever had
in the business.

I don't understand.

You guys were the best at what
you did. How could...

When you do something
as dangerous

as going into a place where
the wind that can throw your car

hundreds of yards,

every ride home,

you get little more numb.

So the next time you go back...

you want to go in further...

and you want to stay longer...

to satisfy some sort of...

<i>what, I don't know.</i>

If my grad student
hadn't taken a friend,

they'd be here.

If they would have loaded one

<i>50-pound probe into the truck
rather than two,</i>

they'd be here.

If they'd taken
Highway 44, they'd be here.

If they had been on
any other stretch of land

at that moment, they...

I used to think that the risk
that we took

had some
sort of calling because...

Because we chased
for knowledge...

not thrill.

I guess Mother Nature
doesn't care. [chuckles]

Then why do it?

Because somebody has to.

I just don't want it to be Will.

[tense music]

[Roy snoring]

[distant conversation]

[man laughs]

Dry line stalled.

Take a look at these
lapse rates for tomorrow.

Oh, you thinking about
Southwest Nebraska?

Oh, yeah.
All right.

Hey, bud.
[William] Hey.

You chase today?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
For the first time.

All right, hang on.
Give this kid a beer.

Come on in, buddy.
Sure.

first beer, man.

Thanks, guys.

Have a seat.
Thanks.

the HRRR and the NAMNEST?

Um, yeah. Yeah, a little bit.

Okay. What about, uh,
what about CAPE values?

Look, let me tell you.

Okay, so at about
a thousand CAPE, all right,

you're gonna get thunderstorms.
Mm-hmm.

It's as simple as that.

Today, the CAPE was 2,600

and you saw
what happened, right?

All right, now look at this.
At four p.m. tomorrow...

Six p.m.

Eight p.m.

At eight p.m., Southwest
Nebraska is forecasted to see

CAPE values between
4,500 and 5,000.

A loaded gun.

That-that's good, right?

Is it good? Son, those are
Wichita Fall numbers.

Yeah.

and those kids

became a missile.

[knocking on door]
[Zane] Ding dong.

Mr. Brody Storm Tours himself!

Zane, kid here
popped his cherry today.

[Zane] No shit.
[Martin] Yup.

I'm so sorry, guys.
Thanks for the beer.

Um, I... I should go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

You don't know who this is?

You're disrespecting
his old man?

This is Bill Brody's son!

Wait, you're the kid?

I heard that you rode one out
in a phone booth.

Hey, your father's a legend.

This kid's parents are
the reason I started chasing.

Did you know that?

Seriously?
Yeah.

The probes they engineered.

Yeah. They... they still hold
the record for most intercepts.

Boy, your mom has some brass.

We used to call her
the Mama Bear

because of all the time
she spent in that Bear's Cage.


Nobody collects data there
unless it's by accident.

Yeah, except for the Brodys.

Bill Brody did things
nobody else dared to do

and he did 'em again and again.

I mean, he pulled off
the moon landing

with nothing more than
a high school diploma.

Now how does somebody like that
ever get into money trouble?

I... I don't follow.

Science love scientists.

Even though
your dad had your mom,

he was always
gonna be an outsider.

People love labels. It's easier.

To them, he was...

an adrenaline junkie.

Just like the rest of us.
Cheers.

[men chuckle]
Why can't you be both?

Well...

when you're ready
to prove them wrong,

you know where to find me.

Anyway... [groans]

I need my hat here, boy.

I got me a van
full of new troops in the AM

and I don't have
an effing driver. Gawd!

Ah, I should probably
head out too, guys.

All right, well, hey, boys.

Y'all be safe tomorrow.

If those Southwesterlies
get backed by the southeast...

Wake up. Whoo!

Don't become friends with them.

They're gonna be dead
by the end of the month.

[both chuckle]
[Skip] Son of a bitch.


Hey!

Wait.

Why did you tel me all that?

I meant everything I said.

But there's a dark side to this,

and your father
crossed over from time to time.

Shit, we all have.

But he never lost sight
of what was important.

Nice watch.

Battle scars.

I dig it.

[soft music]

[birds chirping]

[music continues]

[indistinct chatter]

We were all laughing.

[door opens]


[crowd murmurs]

That's Bill Brody's son.

It's your fan club.

What's happening?

Ghost of a giant, kid.

Follow me.


Are you some sort of celebrity?
[chuckles]

So, what can I get you fellas?

I am gonna have the world-famous
huevos rancheros, please.

You know what?

Make it two.

I hate to be a bother,
but how bad is it gonna get?

Where do you live?

Well, I'm just a couple
of miles down the road.

But my sister lives up in Colby.

Does she have a shelter?
Yes, sir.

Tell her to stay near it.

The storms are probably
going to clear

to the northeast,
but best be safe.

I used my dad's concept
as a guide.

So, uh, when I reviewed
the models...

[woman] Hey, new reports out.
[William] ...it all clicked.

[man] What does it say?
[woman] Imperial, yeah.

[man] Oh, really? - [man 2]
Hey, hey, Southwest Nebraska.

Let's go!


[suspenseful music]

No, no, no.
Your mom is meeting us here.

And she's on her way.
Until then, we stay put.

How does she know where I was?

You're my responsibility
until you become your mom's,

so sit your ass down.

Don't wait, bro. Let's go.

Roy Cameron.

Just wait.

If you taste those
huevos rancheros,

it'll change your life.

You're being a dick. Let's go.

You boys ready? Let's go.

[music intensifies]

Got a high roller today,
bought out the tour.

Can't afford to worry about
an intercept now.

Just get me within range.
I need this.

And think of the story;
it'll tell itself.

Okay. The next few hours,
I'm God.

Whatever I say goes. All right?

Have you ever heard of
plausible deniability?

Every day.

[bell jingles]
I'm serious.

If you're tired of
messing around,

being a tour operator...

give me a call.

Say hi to Kim for me.
I will.

Not again.

[dramatic music]

[thunder rumbling]

you're in for a treat today.

We've got the son of the
legendary Storm Chaser,

Bill Brody,
riding along with us.

[speaking in Hindi]

Big Bill. The Dalai Lama
of storm chasers.

[speaking in Hindi]

What did he say?

You like history?


In 1949, a guy named
Dr. Horace Byers

was hired by
the government to find out why

commercial airliners
were falling out of the sky.

He got some fighter pilots
to fly their jets

through thunderstorms
and they discovered

that nearly all storms
are like lungs.

One breath in, one breath out. Simple.

But there was an outlier.

Under the right conditions,

there was a particular storm
that would rotate its rain

out of its throat,

allowing it
to breathe in and out...

for hours.

You know what he called it?

Supercell.

Good boy.

[speaking in Hindi]

[suspenseful music plays]

[bell jingles]


Hello, Roy.

He abducted me.
Uh-huh, I'm sure.

You look...

like a whole person still.

Gee, thanks.

Where's my son
before I castrate you?

Really? In front of the kid?

I'm 17.

You're the heartbreaker
since the seventh grade.

Where's my son, Roy?

[nervous sigh]

[indistinct conversation
over radio]

[radio static]

[in Hindi] We haven't seen storm
as severe as this before.

[thunder crashes]

[dramatic music]

[static and announcement
over radio]

[device whirring]

Does that tin can work?

[device whirring]

[Roy over radio]
<i>Zane, come in.</i>

<i>You got William Brody with you?</i>

[device beeps]
<i>- </i> [William] Shit.

Hey, hey, hey. Careful.

Put it back in the van.
Let's go.

[dramatic music]

[tires screeching]


You're still pulling
the same shit

that you did ten years ago?

Why don't you just eliminate me?

You're so good at
eliminating the Brodys.

You know, if it wasn't for me,

Bill would have checked out
long before Wichita Falls.

I took on that man's load

while you stayed at home
playing keyboard cowboy!

I was raising our son, Roy.

But I stayed here!

I was here...

trying to... to
preserve something.

And I gotta tell you
something, Quinn.

Your son?

He is one of us.

You had no right to give him
that journal, Roy.

He loves you, Quinn,

but you can't put a collar
on a no-collar dog

and expect him to be happy.
Hey!

Shouldn't we be chasing?

I'll drive my husband's truck.

[engine starts]
You getting in?

[foreboding music]

[engine revving]

[thunder rumbles]

Buckle up. We're going to war.

So exciting to be here.

So exciting to be here.

[beeping]
[Zane] Anything?

[tires screech]

[engine revs]

I thought Imperial
was the target.

Not for deployment.

But we don't need to get close
with the microphone.

The whole point is that we can
do it from a safe distance.

Come on, son. We're cowboys,
just like your dad.

[tense music playing]

[wind whooshing]

The place they're going to
is very dangerous.

[thunder rumbling]

Oh, God.

[engine revving]

[vehicle honks]

Find me an East route
or we're gonna lose it.

No, we're too close.

We're not too close.
East route, now!

[in Hindi] It's very bumpy.

There's no pavement
for another two miles.

I don't need pavement.

[tires squealing]

[in Hindi] They feel
this is the correct route.

Always follow the good air.

Get your phones ready.

[in Hindi] Oh, no.

[tires squeal] - [Ramesh in
Hindi] They're driving recklessly.

Our escape route
is around the bend,

about one mile. Highway 33.

Now's your chance. Let's go.

[speaking in Hindi]

We're inside.

Major Tom, why don't you put
your headphones on

and find me a pulse.

Don't be scared.

We haven't lost anyone yet.


[device whirring]


[thunder rumbling]

up there, you understand?

Oh, no.

Hey, never mind that,
it's just the RFD.

Where the hell you going?

[rhythmic pulses]

[indistinct conversation
in Hindi]

[rhythmic pulses]

[van horn honks]

[rhythmic pulses continue]

[thunder cracks]

[rhythmic pulses intensifies]

[high-pitched whine]

[thunder rumbles]


[tense music]

[van horn honks]


And close that door!

[radio beeps]

Hey, Roy. Please come in.
Do you copy?

We're on a dirt road
about a mile west of Exit 33.

[Ramesh in Hindi] Let's go.

[grunts]
[Ramesh in English] Go forward!

Hey, I'm gonna push.

You drive.
I'll get out and push.

When I give you the thumbs up,

you start to ease back.

Okay?



[car door closes]

[suspenseful music]


Keep it spinning.
Keep it spinning.




Come on!

[grunts]
[William] Come on!


Oh, my God.

[Zane grunts]

[tires screeching]

[Zane pants]


[foreboding music]

[both panting]


No!


Reverse! Reverse!

Ah! Can you even drive?

I absolutely cannot!

[dramatic music]

Heads down!

â™ª

[static over radio] - [Roy
over radio] G<i>et out of there now!</i>

<i>You're in the Bear's Cage!</i>

<i>We're heading down 33!</i>

<i>- Which mile marker are you on?</i>
I'm going backwards here.

How the hell
am I supposed to know that?

[sirens chirp]

[dramatic music]


[tires squeal]
[horn honks]


[thunder crashes]

William!
Mom?


Mom!
[Quinn] Move over.


[radio beeps]
[Quinn over radio] <i>Follow us.</i>

[tires squeal]


Why were you driving?

[thunder rumbling]

The tornado was
right on top of us.

It's okay.

I'm here with you now.
It's okay.

Hey.

It's gonna be all right.

[Roy over radio] <i>South storm
ate the North storm.</i>

The low-level jet
just kicked in.

[thunder rumbling]

Well, at least
it's stopped raining.

That's good, right?

No.

[over radio]
<i>We're still in the cage.</i>

<i>If we get through McCook,</i>

<i>we got a South route, two miles.</i>

[thunder rumbling]

That... that whole thing's
a tornado?

[dramatic music]

Mom. Fuel, we're low.

Forget the South route.
We need a shelter now.

The Victory Christian Academy,
[emergency alarm blares]

It's two blocks North,
three blocks East.

[alarm blares]

[tires screech]

[alarm continues]

Where is it, Roy?

Hey, over there.

Turn around! Turn around!
[Roy] <i>On it.</i>

[tires squeal]




[dramatic music]

Harper! Take this. Get inside.

Tour is over. Let's go.

[Ramesh in Hindi]
Please move! Let's go.

[screaming]
[man] Come on!


[William pants]

What are you doing?

Dad's journal is under the seat.

What? What?



Is Will in there?


No, I can't leave it.
Look, hey! Let it go.


I'm stuck.

[Roy] What?
[William] I'm stuck.

[dramatic music]

It's your watch! Your watch!

Undo it! Undo it!

Come on. Undo it.
[William] It's stuck.



[Roy grunts]

Will!

[glass breaking]

Come inside! You're gonna die.


Where are you going?

[grunts, pants]

[Quinn] Will!
[Roy groans]

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

[groans] I think I broke something.
[Quinn] You okay?

You're gonna make it.

[breathes heavily]


The pool.

[all pant]

All right. All right.

[Roy grunts]

Hold your breath.

[unsettling music]

[muffled screams, crash]

[somber music]

On my count, ready?

One, two, three.
[all grunt]

[speaking in Hindi]

How'd y'all plan on
getting home?

I don't know.

Haven't thought about it.

[vehicle beeping]

Well, at least you know
how to drive now.

[music swelling]

[air brakes hiss]

[mechanical squeaking]

I lost it.

We can build another.

Your dad would be proud.

I did it for you.

[dramatic music]
