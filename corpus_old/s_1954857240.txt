Time!

Daddy!

Hey!

Whoo!

So how'd I do?

You did good.

See?

I did great.

I did great.

Hello!

Hello!

Marianne!

Do you think mom will let
me come back next weekend?

I don't know.

Certainly couldn't hurt to ask.

Definitely ask.

Definitely ask.

Yeah.

Look, look, look.

See that hawk?

Mm-hmm.

Wow.

Isn't that neat?

That's beautiful.

Do you think you and mom
will ever get back together?

You know something, baby?

Mommy and daddy love each
other very, very much.

And we love you very, very much.

We just have some
things to work out.

That's all.

Okay?

Wow.

A ladybug.

A ladybug.

You know something?

I think we will.

In fact, I know we will.

We'll be a family
again real soon.

You'll see.

Okay?

Now, we better get
you to school, huh?

Okay, come on.

Now, your mom's gonna be
picking you up from school,

now, your mom's gonna be
picking you up from school,

right?
Yeah.

Okay.

Go to the d.I.

On my knees.

Sergeant north,
don't hurt me, please.

Sergeant north,
don't hurt me, please.

Teach me to fight
and stay alive.

Teach me to fight
and stay alive.

I'm still a baby,
too young to die.

I'm still a baby,
too young to die.

Left, left.

All right, maggots, my name's
master sergeant John north.

And not only do you have
the pleasure of having me as

your drill sergeant, I
will also double as your

hand-to-hand combat
instructor as well.

Isn't that peachy?

Right!

Hoo!

Let me explain something
about hand-to-hand combat,

gentlemen.

Gentlemen.

It's not about size.
It's not about strength.

It's not about egos.

It's about timing.

It's about distance.

Full time march!

It's about position.

See how my hand is
controlling his neck?

So that I place him
where I want him.

I bring him down.

I lock him.

Self-infliction.

Left, left, right, left!

I'm gonna tell you right now,

it's not about size and strength
in hand-to-hand combat.

It's about you and me.

We block, parry, and enter.

Come back in.

We slice his neck.

Hip position.

Hip position.

Grab your opponent.

Jugular.

Back of the skull.

You just crank until
you hear a snap.

It's all about
torque and balance.

War is not a game.

It's meant to be played by men,

and that's what
I'm gonna make you.

We take our opponent's
right hand, take him,

take him down, roll,
finish our opponent.

I'm gonna throw you,

and I'm gonna teach you
how to throw me.

Not bad.

Hiya, pumpkin.

Hi.

Are we going home?

We have to run a
couple of errands.

Why don't you say hi to Hank?

Okay.

Okay.

It's me.

Yeah?

Are we there?

Middle of bumfuck.

Bumfuck nowhere.

Are you with him?

Yeah.

Yeah, we're standing
with the man right now.

Can we hurry this up?

Sam's waiting for me already.

Quick time, halt!

Platoon, halt!

Order!

Halt!

Fall out.

How do you do it, sarge?

Got the ammo?

Yeah, we set to go.

Yeah, we set to go.

Pay him.

We cool.

Good.

I'm getting Dexter's
rifles tonight.

Get your ass back to L.A.

Right.

Got an audience.

Well, then, take care of it.

Yeah.

Hi, Hank.

Hey, Darlene.

Hey, Darlene.

$10 unleaded.

Sure. How you doing today?

Mom?

Great.

There you are.

What's wrong, marianne?

No.

Mommy.

Come on, g, let's
get out of here.

Watch the door.

Holy shit.

Marcus!

All units, code 12,
11547, cancel.

Oh, man, that's all I need.

Do you think you got him?

Go look.

Fuck you.

We be just fine.

Officer down, code 11.

Roger, backup units rolling.

Move sooner, move sooner.

Rock homer, rock
homer, rock homer.

Okay, you--

Should have known better
than to come in here

with some howdy-doody
white motherfucker,

talk like he run-d.M.C.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Keep it up, motherfucker.

What?
Keep it up.

What? Drop my ass then, man.

One victim may be
in cardiac arrest.

Respond to that.

Marianne.

I got at least
three gunmen inside.

One confirmed dead.

One dead or wounded.

They got a little girl hostage.

They say they're
gonna shoot her.

North!

No, John, no!

John!

John!

You want me to drop your ass,
you little mother--

Yeah, you ain't got the nerve.

Drop me, man. Drop me.

Hey, hey, hey!

Check it out.

All units, all units in
vicinity of willow and cherry,

code 30.

Proceed code 3.

Get him out of there.

John, no!

Damn it!

What the fuck?

Hold your fire.

Hold your fire!

Daddy!

You must have a death wish, boy.

You must have a death wish, boy.

Just take--take it easy.

The police sent me in
exchange for the girl.

You don't want to
hurt a little girl.

What the fuck you know about me?

You want to know something
about me, motherfucker?

Watch this.

Daddy!

Daddy.

Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah, what ride
you want to take?

White horse.

Enjoy.

Courtesy of uncle Sam.

What the--fucker.

Uh-oh.

Tsk, tsk.

Army's looking for you boys.

They seem to think you stole
some high-tech military ordnance

and then went awol.

And then went awol.

Today's army, I tell you.

Hey, keep it down in there!

Now, we are here
for those rare guns.

Buddy, this is fucked up.

We got a heavy hitter coming to
pay down for that shit tonight,

and when they
hear what you done,

your ass is gonna be grass.

That's very good.

You follow muhammad ali,
don't you?

You follow muhammad ali,
don't you?

You just don't dance as good.

Now, let me explain
the situation.

I have spent the last 36
hours snorting whiskey,

drinking smack, and
shooting cocaine,

and visa is breathing down
my neck because my shitty

day job just isn't
paying the bucks.

Now, what I want to
know from you is,

where are the guns?

Where are the guns?

Man, look, we've got no
ammunition for this shit.

They're no fucking good to you.

Love ya.

Mean it.

Look into your
heart, soldier boy.

The only way you get to live
longer is if you don't tell

me where the guns are.

Confused?

Well, you see, then
I get to torture you.

Well, you see, then
I get to torture you.

No?

Citibank doesn't wait.

Nor do I.

I thought you were
gonna torture him.

I don't have time for that shit.

Hold this, fella.

Tsk, tsk.

Voila.

Nobody fucking move!

Keep it the fuck down, man.

I'm trying to sleep!

Looks like you had
a party here tonight.

Looks like you had
a party here tonight.

Oh, that's sweet.

Give me some of that.

Oh, man, that smells good.

Is it my imagination, or
does the army spray this

shit with perfume
before they ship it?

Excuse me, but what do
you think you're doing?

I'm stealing this shit.

What does it look like?

Well, coincidentally,
that's what it looks like.

Well, coincidentally,
that's what it looks like.

The problem is that
I'm stealing it.

We were here first.

Ooh.

Oh, yeah, well, we
called dibs on it.

Look, you take the drugs,
and we'll take the guns.

Does that sound fair?

Well, I hate to oversimplify,

but I got the gun, motherfucker.

That's my point exactly.

You see, you got the
gun, but I got the guns.

Well, he's one
resilient son of a bitch.

I'll give him that.

I'll give him that.

Am I in a hospital?

Trauma ward, sergeant.

You've been a coma for
the last eight weeks.

What happened to me?

You need to rest.

Doctor, according to you, I've
been resting for eight weeks.

What's the last
thing you recall?

What's the last
thing you recall?

I'm driving home.

Nurse.

Darlene.

Nurse, nurse!

Nurse!

Nurse!

Quick.

Dr. Brock, your patient
is ready in radiology.

Can't keep a good man
down, huh, sergeant?

It's good to see you.

It's good to see you.

Allen,

these people
won't tell me anything.

They won't even let
me see my little girl.

They won't even let
me see my little girl.

John.

Allen.

Please, god, Allen.

She's alive, right?

Technically.

Which are you,
a lawyer or a cop?

Kid, I am the cop.

Kid, I am the cop.

Federal agent Karl savak.

Think you could have taken any
longer getting me out of there?

Fuck you.

You know the song and dance
I had to do

for the U.S. attorney?

Piece of shit like you.

I had to pull smoke and
mirrors right out of my ass

just to get them to believe
we needed you to take down

Dexter Kane.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I haven't thanked you properly.

Thank you for getting me out,

and fuck you while I'm at it.

I wouldn't have been in
there in the first place if

I wouldn't have been in
there in the first place if

I hadn't been looking for
ammunition for guns you

couldn't even fucking get.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Well, why do you
think you're out?

To find out who ripped you off?

I don't think so.

You promised Dexter Kane
guns you couldn't deliver.

That's your problem.

I ain't in your dog
and pony show no more.

I'm just trying to get me a
little money together

and slide on down to Mexico.

Keep the change.

You're gonna be in my
dog and pony show

until the pony dies, pony.

What do you think this is
monopoly?

And you have a
get out of jail free card?

You killed a little girl.

Now you'll do what I say, or
you're gonna be blowing your

chunks in the gas chamber.

It's a beautiful day.

Enjoy it.

When a child is taken
from us in this useless way,

we cannot understand it.

Our faith is tested.

But we must stand strong,
for there is method in madness.

And though we may
long for recourse,

we are taught it is holier
in his eyes to turn the

other cheek,
that we shall not kill,

and that vengeance is his.

And that vengeance is his.

Miss Adams?

Hi.

John north.

We spoke on the phone.

Oh, yes, have a seat, Mr. north.

Thank you.

Now, when we last
spoke, miss Adams,

I had told you that the
federal marshals had

transported the prisoner
that killed my family

transported the prisoner
that killed my family

down here to L.A.

If you remember, you were
gonna find out what was

happening with the case.

Yes.

It turns out the FBI took
immediate custody of the

prisoner, and all information
on the case is sealed.

Sealed?

What exactly does that mean?

Right.

You'll have to talk to
this man, agent Karl savak.

He's running control
on the case now.

Psst, mom.

Yeah, come on.

Mikey, that's bad.

It's true.

Yeah, well, you will be
home for dinner, right?

Yeah, mom.

Mm-hmm.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, boy, when
you see your mother talking

to someone, you don't ignore
them as if they're not there.

Now, this is sergeant north.
Say hello.

What kind of sergeant are you?

I'm in the army, son.

You ever kill anybody?

Michael.

Okay, mom, I'm gone.

Okay, mom, I'm gone.

No, you better give me a kiss
before you walk out that door.

Thank you.

Sorry.

No, it's no problem.

Must be tough raising
a kid around here.

I'll be honest
with you, Mr. north.

It's a daily battle.

These streets hold a magnetism
for a boy Mikey's age.

He's 12 years old, and he
knows those streets as well

as any gang banger.

Well, what about his father?

His father.

Please.

Frankly, he's a
part of the problem.

Frankly, he's a
part of the problem.

That's too bad.

Anyway, Mr. north, what
agent savak's interest is in

the man that you're looking
for, you'll have to ask him.

Fine.

How do I get a
hold of Karl savak?

Sergeant.

Agent Carl savak.

Agent tam, agent klark.

So how can I help you?

My family was murdered
eight weeks ago

in a convenience store, and the
man who did it is currently

in a convenience store, and the
man who did it is currently

being held here
under FBI custody.

I was also instructed to
contact agent Karl savak,

and he would be able to give
me some information about that.

I can't comment.

I'm sorry.

Whoa.

Wait a minute.

You don't understand something.

See, this is son of a bitch

murdered my wife

and my baby girl.

I am not uncompassionate.

I am not uncompassionate.

This man is currently
under federal protection.

I cannot divulge any information
about him at this time.

He's being held under
federal protection.

Our job is law enforcement.

Sometimes we have to turn a
blind eye to smaller crimes

in order to solve the big ones.

Did I just hear you call
the murder of my wife

did I just hear you call
the murder of my wife

and child a small crime?

Whoa.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, time out.

This case is already
very complicated.

But when a man such
as Dexter Kane,

an extremely organized
venice drug lord,

starts trying to buy
military ordnance,

that's a larger
consideration for us.

This son of a bitch is
on the streets, isn't he?

This son of a bitch is
on the streets, isn't he?

That's all for today, sergeant.

No, it's not.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

You're gonna give me the name
of the man who killed my family.

I'd let him go.

Now!

You do not want to fuck with me.

Yeah.

I do.

Blow is dead.

Smack coming back in
a big way, Mr. Kane.

Now I know your war with the
cops got you shut down on

the streets.

I am the alchemist, Mr. Kane.

You got some blow
you can't unload,

I can turn it around
into smack like that.

I can turn it around
into smack like that.

Normally I wouldn't come
and off end you in this way,

but I got to do some traveling,

and I need to make
some fast cash.

So where you been the
past couple of months?

I was back east, family matter.

A family man.

I wouldn't have
pegged you for that.

Blood is everything.

I couldn't agree with
you more, Mr. Kane.

But if I could just
get one key--

Motherfucker was down
at the park.

Shh.

Shh.

Relax.

Relax.

Let it go.

I'm sorry. What was that?

If I could just get
one trial key, Mr. Kane,

I could turn it around at
2k of heroine in 72 hours.

I wouldn't lie about that.

Thank you.

Yo, homey.

Yo, homey.

What size shoe you wear?

None of your
business, that's what.

All right.

Fuck you too.

Man, ain't that Ricky?

Nah.

That ain't him.

Yeah-huh, that's him.

Damn.

All right.

I'm gonna give you a shot.

Put it away, man.

Put it away, man.

Now, where you taking
that, little man?

Compton.

What bus you taking?

19.

What you trading up for?

Smack.

Two key.

My main little man.

Take after his daddy.

You like that?

Yeah.

Yeah.

You ever see a dude capped?

Yeah.

You fuck this up,
you gonna get capped.

Don't be stopping,
talking to your homies.

Just get your ass
down to Compton.

Well, I need my money now,
all right?

You'll get your money when
you get back with the smack.

Man, I said I need it.

Well, why do you need it?

Now, I need it now.

Now, I need it now.

In that case,

let me set you up.

Don't fuck this up.

Yeah.

How about that?

That's it.

Can you put that
on a man's neck?

Can you put that
on a man's neck?

Yeah, I put that on
a guy's neck before.

Whose?

What do you want him for?

I'm gonna give him the
community service award,

all right?

Just tell me who he is.

Well, Marcus is
a friend of ours.

So I figure any message
you want to give to him,

you can just give to us, man.

I really don't think you
want the message I'm gonna

give to Marcus.

I think we do.

All right.

Did you get the message?

I got it.

Where can I find this Marcus?

Okay, okay!

Where can I find--

I don't-- I don't know, man.

I don't-- I don't know, man.

He--he come in here, a
needle and some teardrops,

and he was asking about
some fucking guns and stuff.

That's all I know.

I swear.

What kind of guns?

They were, like,
I don't know, man.

Like, rifles, military stuff.

I don't know.

What does a teardrop signify?

You get another one added
every time you kill somebody.

Bang.

Pow.

Left, left, left, right, left.

Left, left, left, right, left.

Hi, John. It's me.

Hi, John. It's me.

I haven't had any luck
with this Marcus character.

Yeah?

Well, agent savak's a
much more interesting story,

because even though he's
one of the most decorated

officers they have,

he's under internal affairs
investigation.

Yeah, that's no surprise,

but what does all that mean,
Allen?

Well, to me, it
looks like he's dirty.

All right, listen,
this is what I got.

Marcus is trafficking some sort
of military ordnance down here.

If savak's dirty, I got
to think he's tied in with

Marcus on that.

I don't know, is there any
way you can find an address

on savak?

I'll see what I can do.

I'll see what I can do.

Thanks, Allen.

Yeah.

I understand you're in
the market for some guns.

Well, you heard wrong.

Who is this?

Well, that's not
really important, is it?

What is, though, is what I
got and what you're looking for.

Well, like I said,
you--you've got bad information.

Well, like I said,
you--you've got bad information.

Just out of curiosity,

who gave you this bad
information?

And who gave you my number?

Marcus.

I don't have the slightest
idea what you're talking about,

but I don't want
to be impolite either,

so please continue.

Yeah, I thought so.

Tell you what, I'm gonna be
at Hollywood and vine

tell you what, I'm gonna be
at Hollywood and vine

in 15 minutes.

You be there if
you're interested.

You can count on me being there

because I will need
to arrest you.

Hey, savak, I'm gonna
want to see some cash now.

I'm talking thick.

Well, how will I
know what you--damn.

Seeing is as close
as you're gonna get.

Your car, Mr. savak.

You packing heat?

Uh-uh.

Then what good are you?

Let's go see Dexter.

This guy's living
pretty high for a cop.

This guy's living
pretty high for a cop.

Slob.

Pallet 21, mpa-3 rifles
stolen, fort Scott.

Pallet 21, mpa-3 rifles
stolen, fort Scott.

Got you.

Look, two months ago, you
came to me and told me about

some guns that got jacked
off a military base

and they had hit the streets
and the price was a hundred gs.

I gave you 50 g's down.

Where the fuck my guns?

Deal went south.

Cops.

Look, I want my
money or my guns.

Or you can just
relax and let it go.

Or you can just
relax and let it go.

The police got the money too.

Look, I may be a cop,
but I'm not stupid.

I said I'd deliver the guns.

And I will.

I just need to
talk to my sources.

Look around you.

Don't you realize the only
way you ever gonna talk

again is through one of them
straight-up psychic bitches?

Again is through one of them
straight-up psychic bitches?

Then I guess I'll be
telling you all how your fat

black mama was sucking
my dick in hell.

Look, let's not play
with each other.

I said I would
deliver your guns.

And I can.

It's just gonna be a little
difficult to do, dead.

Sergeant Williams?

Sergeant north.

I phoned earlier
about pallet 21.

Oh, yeah.

Pallet 21's a shipment of
mpa-3 high-velocity rifles.

Experimental.

Very nasty piece of ordnance.

You said the weapons.

What about the ammo?

Affirmative.

Munitions weren't on base.

Typical dispatch fuckup.

Well, if they're a prototype,

the ammo's impossible to find.

The ammo's impossible to find.

Weapon's useless without it.

Maybe that's why a case
of it was stolen up in your

neck of the woods
about ten weeks ago.

It was recovered when a
couple of civilians tried to

shoot their way out of a
convenience store up there.

Killed two military dependents.

What's so special
about these weapons?

Sergeant, go ahead.

Fire at will.

That kid Mikey
ain't got here yet.

What you mean he
ain't there yet?

He was supposed
to come on the 19.

He's supposed to
be there by now.

Well, he ain't, and
I ain't gonna sit on

these--much longer.

These--much longer.

And that base better not
be cut with no goddamn rat

poison this time.

Yeah, all right,
all right, all right.

Look, just--just--just--he's

probably on the
next bus right now.

Just chill and call
me when he gets there.

Dexter's pissed.

Yeah.

Man, you ain't carrying
no base for no Dexter.

Man, you ain't carrying
no base for no Dexter.

Yeah, what's that?

Damn.

Here let me touch it.

Yo, man, that's
some dope base, man.

That's a pound man.

Yeah, well, check this.

Solid.

Cool.

Hey, man, what the
fuck you looking at?

Chill, chill, he's a cop.
He's a cop.

Look, I don't care
if he's spider-man.

I am gonna fuck him up.

Yeah, well, just chill.

Well, I got to jam
to practice, man.

Later.

Yeah, we'll see you later.

Yeah, later.

Yeah, then he says
it's none of my business.

You believe that?

Right.

None too cool.

Who's cool?

So this fool, he tried
to fucking b.A. Me and shit.

Blasted him off his
fucking surfboard.

The dude was pissing
in his pants.

What the fuck you looking at?

I said what the fuck
are you looking at?

You chump!

You chump!

Yo, yo, man, yo.

Get lost.

You're dead, little man.

Take it easy now.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

Just want to ask you a
couple of questions now--

Then give it back.

Look, I said take it easy.

Man, I'll fuck you up.

That's my school bag.

Is that right?

Well, let's check that out.

That's one hell of
a class load, kid.

What's this for, chemistry?

Son of a bitch!

Well, look who's back.

Anyway, you said you'd
give me my bag back.

Yeah, sure.

Here you go.

It ain't got everything
that was in it.

I know.

How well do you know
the streets, Mikey?

I know 'em hard.

So what?

You think you
could spread a rumor?

Fast?

Yeah.

So?

So you want your bag back?

So you want your bag back?

You Mikey?

Maybe.

Maybe.

Let's go. We got to talk.

I can talk fine right here.

Word is you're down with
some army dude who's got

some bullets we're looking for.

Well, well.

Maybe I'll help you,
and maybe I won't.

Or maybe this dude got
something I want too.

Man, you're lucky.

That's funny.
I don't feel lucky.

My bag.

It's in the trunk of
your car, ain't it?

Could be.

Yeah.

Well, anyway, you
know how you, um,

well, anyway, you
know how you, um,

told me to spread the word
about those bullets, right?

Yeah.

So some guys came down
to the beach last night.

So do you really
have them bullets?

Nope.

Then why are you making
me say that you did?

To get to the guns.

The guy I'm looking
for is after them.

The guy I'm looking
for is after them.

I get there first,
he comes to me.

You sure this is the place?

Yeah, this is the place.

Wait here.

Don't be a stranger.

Come on in.

Damn.

What you got in the bag?

What do you boys plan
on doing with these guns?

Oh, we're gonna take
the town over, brah.

You writing a book?

No, I'm closing one.

What the fuck?
This isn't ammunition.

Do something about this.

One sec.

911?

911?

I'm at 203 rose street.

I'm gonna need five
ambulances right away.

Damn.

Asshole.

So where you learn all that?

Around, different places.

Hey, you think you could
teach someone like me?

Yeah, probably.

What would you do with it?

Kick someone's ass.

Then probably not.

Then probably not.

So you just use it on that
kid like yesterday, Mikey.

Nah, I don't need it for him.

I'm gonna kill him.

Listen to you, Mikey.

You're 12 years old.

Aren't you worried about jail?

Why should I be
worried about jail?

I ain't old enough.

You got a answer for
everything, don't you?

What's killing him gonna do?

Is it gonna bring your
friend back, Mikey?

Is it gonna bring your
friend back, Mikey?

It's gonna make me feel good.

That's what it's
going to accomplish.

Then forget it.

No.

Well, why not?

You do it.

No, Mikey.

No.

It's different.

You think that's what I'm doing,

just kicking ass
just to kick ass?

I don't know what you're doing,

so why don't you tell me?

What are you doing here?

Looking for somebody.

Yeah.

Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

That's my business.

All right.

Yeah.

Anyway, I need my 25 back.

Nice try.

Look, I ain't gonna
kill nobody, all right?

Then what do you
need the gun for?

To protect myself.

Mikey, I'm watching out for you.

I'll protect you.

Man, you ain't protecting
or watching out for shit.

Man, you ain't protecting
or watching out for shit.

I ain't got a gun on the street,

that kid who dropped Ricky,
he gonna drop me too.

And there ain't nothing you
can do to change that, bro.

Look, Mikey, I'm
not your father.

I am not here to run your life
or to judge you.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Mikey!

All right, all right, come on!

Go, go, go.

Go, go, go.

So who's playing?

D.A. And FBI.

Welcome back to the
winning team, pony.

Man, you're
totally fucking nuts.

You know this is a
motherfucking cop convention.

It's playoff week.

D.A.' S got a good team.

Good eye!

So tell me, when am I
meeting that redhead prick

who stole my guns?

You ain't.

Red's got Jack.

Are you trying to
fuck me again, pony?

No.

Just saying Dexter Kane
jacked him up for the guns.

Horse shit!

If Dexter Kane had jacked
him up for the guns,

he wouldn't be saying shit,
because first and foremost,

they'd be dead.

That's what they're saying.

Remember me, asshole?

You jacked my guns in a
crack house a few months ago?

Now, who's got my guns?

Now, who's got my guns?

Suck me!

Really?

Some army cat, man.

I don't know.

What do you mean some army cat?

What, like, one person?

That's impossible, surely.

I'm telling you,
it was some kid.

Mikey something.

Really?

Now, guess how Webster
defines inferno.

Now, guess how Webster
defines inferno.

Oh! No!

All right, man.

Stop sweating me. Come on!

We best take this inside.

Don't you fight me.

Don't you dare fight me.

Don't you dare fight me.

Savak, man, this ain't cool.

Shut up, and be
glad it's not you.

Savak.

Savak!

Now, you are gonna set
up a powwow with your army

buddy and pronto, you got it?

What the fuck you looking at?

What the fuck you looking at?

What's up?
How you doing?

Good.

Mr. north.

What are you doing
sitting on my steps?

You all right?

Yeah.

Sure.

No.

I understand, Mr. north.

I understand, Mr. north.

I understand what it's like
to live with pain every day.

Do you?

Mm-hmm.

My boy acts tough, but he's not.

Last night he came home,

and I knew right away
something had happened.

And I'll never
know exactly what.

Well, the truth of the
matter is, one night,

he's not gonna come home.

He's not gonna come home.

And I'll never know exactly
what happened then either.

That's what I live
with every day.

Come on, now.

Come on.

Come here.

Come in.

Come on. Come on.

You all right?

Everything okay?

I guess not.

Look, Mikey, I owe
you an apology.

For getting you involved
in all this stuff.

For getting you involved
in all this stuff.

I wasn't thinking
about you, my friend.

I wasn't thinking about anybody.

Except myself.

What I wanted.

I know where that dude is.

What dude?

The dude with the
bat on his neck.

Marcus.

I'm looking for a
white man names Marcus.

What's the last
thing you recall?

You must have a death wish, boy.

As long as you're
my little girl,

I can lift the whole wide world.

This man is currently
under federal protection.

Savak's got to be
tied into this somehow.

Pallet 21's a shipment of
mpa-3 high-velocity rifles.

I'm looking for somebody.

He's got a tattoo of
a bat on his neck.

Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

What does a teardrop signify?

You get another one added
every time you kill somebody.

Daddy!

Daddy!

John, no!

Daddy.

This must be your boy.

All right.

He's in the building.

Places.

I don't believe it.

I don't believe it.

I'm gonna count to three.

Anyone who wants to can leave.

Anyone who doesn't
is gonna get hurt.

Anyone who doesn't
is gonna get hurt.

What the--who is this fuck?

Where's the guns?

One.

It was you.

You ripped off that
redheaded prick.

Two.

What?

You want him?

You want to kill him?

Let's give them some space.

Say what?

You don't even remember, do you?

You killed my wife.

You murdered my child.

Say hi to your
wife and kids for me!

I'm warning you, motherfucker,

those are cops out there!

Psst.

Psst.

Fire escape.

Fire escape.

Fuck you.

No.

Come on.

Don't. Don't.

No.

Come on.

Don't.

Don't.

Mikey, get out of here, now.

Mikey, I said get out of here.

Go.

Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

Jesus, north.

That's pathetic.

Now I got to shoot him
myself at some point.

What a pain in the ass.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

This is one stone I'm gonna
use to kill a lot of birds.

Hey, kid, thanks for the help.

I'll see you get put up
for a citizenship award.

And now, sergeant,

it's time for your
pavlovian response class.

What are you doing?

I'm wasting him.

Wasting him?

What are you,
trigger-happy nuts?

What has he done
to deserve that?

What the hell you talking about?

You're a menace, you know that?

Yes, you.

It's people like you scare me.

It's people like you scare me.

So what the fuck
we gonna do with him?

Just put him in the car.

Well, I've had
some complications,

but I'll have Mr. Kane's shit.

I will have it back.

I will have it back.

Stop it.

Please, man.

My man's gonna have
it back tomorrow.

Just another 24 hours.

I swear to god, man.

If I don't have it by then,
you can waste me.

Stop it, please, man.

Tomorrow come mighty
fast, motherfucker.

See some identification.

Luther Kane.

Any relation to Dexter Kane?

Yeah, he's my brother.

But I'm not in that
business, officer.

I'm an accountant.

I'm an accountant.

I'm aware of that, sir.

Then why did you pull me over?

Well, you see, here's the thing.

It's illegal to drive dead, sir.

What the fuck?

Dexter Kane got Marcus.

Well, I'm sorry, Mikey.

It's my fault.

But I'm gonna take that base
back and give it to Dexter Kane.

You came here to ask
for my help, didn't you?

They shot my wife.

He murdered my little girl.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, they're
gonna kill me next.

I won't last the week if I
don't deliver the drugs to Kane.

But now I can see why
you can't help me.

So just forget it, man.

Mikey, wait a minute.

Come here.

They can't hold me here
longer than 24 hours.

If you wait for me,

I'll help you.

1:00, pacific and Washington.

Okay.

His brother killed
last night, cops.

I am truly sorry.

He's not in the best of moods.

Dexter's rifles
with my condolences.

Ammunition with my compliments.

I do believe you
owe me some money.

Now ain't the time, cuz.

Hey, I'm human.

Hey, I'm human.

And I do sympathize.

But when it comes to
money, I do not relax,

and I do not let it go.

50 g's.

I guess you want
your 50 g's, right?

I hear today's the last
day in the world series.

You still pitching for the feds
at the big game this afternoon?

I didn't know you
followed baseball.

I don't.

Savak.

Savak.

They bought it.

They bought it.

Let's go play some ball.

This better fucking work.

How do you know Dexter's
gonna take the bait?

Dexter thinks the police
killed his brother last night.

He'll take it.

Let's go, baby.

Uncle Sam wants you.

Uncle Sam wants you.

Huh?

Wait a minute.

I was supposed to
be released today.

Your short-term
memory sucks, sergeant.

We found heavyweight illegal
arms in your trunk yesterday.

You broke the law.

The d.A. Thinks that with
fingerprint evidence

and our impeccable testimony

that they can
make a case not only for

possession but for the
intent to distribute.

Isn't that great?

You don't understand something.

I got somebody waiting for me.

I got somebody waiting for me.

That's okay.

As long as they don't
mind waiting 20 years.

15 with time off
for good behavior.

Come on.

Told you tomorrow
came mighty quick.

Not so hot to see Mr.
Kane now, are you,

you motherfucker?

Look, my man's gonna
show up with the shit.

He's just running a little late.

He's gonna get here, man.

Come on.

Look, you said 2:30.

If your man ain't
show up by then,

you can tell it to god
through a plastic bag.

You can tell it to god
through a plastic bag.

Let's go.

Oh, man, I feel a
real need to relieve.

Come on, there's a
bathroom right there.

What?

What?

I got no hands here.

What, are you nuts?

Come on, man, there
ain't no one around.

No, no.

No way.

Come on, you don't
got to hold it.

You just got to pull it out.

Use your tie if you
don't want to touch it.

I trust you.

Sometimes it snakes
down the right side,

sometimes it snakes
down the right side,

so just follow it to
the end, roll it out.

Man, fuck this shit.

Yeah, on second thought,
it is a two-hand job.

That was not a bluff, my man.

What's up?

How you doing, officer?

Hey.

Whoa!

What are you doing?

Get back here!

Get that guy!

God damn it!

I'm sorry about your
brother, Mr. Kane.

Cops killed Dexter's brother.

Let's kill some cops.

All right, play ball!

Drop your weapons.
You're under arrest.

What the--

Blanks.

Move, you die.

Come on, man.

Mr. Kane--you can't--you
can't kill me for a lousy

key of base, man.

Break something.

I could understand that.

Answer it.

Saved by the bell.

Maybe.

Damn.

34.

34.

34.

Roger, 34.

Go ahead.

Yeah, I need an
address on a Dexter Kane.

Why would you care whether
this buster lives or dies?

Rat poison.

Oh, my god, Mr. Kane, you
got to believe I would never--

Changed my mind.

You're dead, motherfucker.

Not until the fat
lady sings, pony.

And I'm the fat lady.

Drop it.

You're under arrest for the
purchase of illegal firearms

with intent of
first-degree murder

of law enforcement officers.

That was for resisting arrest.

That was for resisting arrest.

You know what they say.

Dead ponies tell no tales.

Come on, man, savak.

Or is it

dead ponies have no tails?

Anyway--

I'm not really
a kid killer, kid.

I used to have Marcus
do that sort of thing.

But unfortunately, he's just
not gonna be very reliable

from here on out, so don't
take this personally.

It's funny how things
work out, isn't it, savak?

You're the one.

You're the one who's responsible

for my family's death.

Marcus was just the
gun in your hand.

Well, soldier, that's a whole
another philosophical debate,

because you see,
what we have here is

a Mexican standoff.

You shoot me.

I shoot the kid.

I don't think so, because
once I separate your head

from your body, you won't be
shooting anybody else again,

savak.

Yeah?

Do it.

Go ahead.

Smart soldier.

You see, even Smith and
Wesson doesn't have that

kind of guarantee.

Touchdown, motherfucker.

I can smell revenge, John.

It is John, isn't it?

You like counting, don't you?

Yeah.

Well, now I'm counting, John.

I'm gonna give you three.

And if I don't see you,

I'm gonna blow this kid's
head clean off,

and you know I'll do it.

So come on out
and join me, John.

One.

Two!

Don't push me.

Two and a half!

It's on your head, north!

Three!

Mikey, come here.

Give me your hand.

Now I want you to
get out of here.

Why aren't you coming, man?

I said get out of here.

You just couldn't switch
off the life support again,

could you?

Could you?

Son of a bitch!

Point game.

When I get 6'6", you ain't
even gonna see no point game.

All right?

Give me the ball.

Let's check.

All right, I'll
be around for that.

You missing me again?

Or do I even need to be 6'6"?

Come on, man.

Come on. Come on.

I'm gonna teach you everything.

I'm gonna teach you everything.

Oh!

But is it gonna go in?

Oh, it's good. It's good.

All right.

Well, losers out,
'cause it's my ball.

You got that? You got that?

Come on.

Right here.

There's a lot more games
to be played, brother.

Lot more games to be played.
