oh rabbish...

McNabb!

Quatermain!

hello...

duck!

cut me loose ... now!

Come on.

That's right...

Sorry, cully...

My dearest Elizabeth, at long last,
my seemingly endless quest

to unlock the mystery of King Solomon's Mines

is almost over...

I must also report
with a certain restraint

while I'm as close to the mine
as I have ever been

there are outside forces that could
prevent me from reaching my goal,

momentarily I'm sure...

It has come to my attention
that my wealthy benefactors

and the local Kuakuani tribes

are in some sort of competition

to plunder
the riches of Africa

it has become depressingly apparent
that  you're the only one I can still trust.

I am sending ytou this map
for safekeeping

this is a tremendous value and
must be guarded with great care.

It is my hope that I can protect you
from the dangers that I have found.

But in the event that you should
needed protection

I urgent to look up
Allan Quatermain.

He is a man of great honor.

Please keep  this map
from harms away

and perhaps we can keep
the mine safe

from those who would tarnish
this legend forever.

Your loving father.

Binto

Take this.

run as fast as you can
and stop for no one...

Quatermain,

Africa shines on you

you should not blame this land
for your bad luck.

Khiva, I am not blaming Africa for anything

there has nothing to do with it
with bad luck.

partners stabbing me in
the back in my...

my wife ...

I have a son in England
who I belive needs the father.

And it's about time I become one

You do not belong in England,
You belong are here with us.

Yea Africa won't be the same
without you

Africa is will be the same
wether I am here or not

Who you are?

I am Twala. King of this land
and all what you see.

Oh, you speak english?

I know the language
of the white man.

But why did you bring me here?

do you have a map
thad leads to a key?

I want that key.

I have not the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

Kill him.

Now? ...  wait.

Yes, I ... I ... I found

I found a map and may had mentioned...

something about a key. But it,s long gone
I sent across ...

the great ocean, to my
daughter in England.

thad is unfortunate for you.

you bring it back...

that's impossible.

No, Maitland!
Nothing is impossible.

you write to your daughter in England

and tell her to bring
that map back to us

the czar ... of Russia

hired me to find that map
and he had a great army behind him.

I wasn't afraid of him...
and I am not afraid to die.

I can produce pain
for worth than death.

Father?

Hello, Harry.

Father!

oh god I missed you ...

I also.

now let me look at you

You're definitly not little Harry anymore,
I guess to call "great Harry" huh?

Hello, Charles.

Who's there?

Hi, Margaret.

It's been a long time, Allan.

Yes it is.

You can not go to take him back to Africa.
No no .. I'm back...

I'm in London.
No, Allan.

Harry is happy here.
We have take in custody.

If you'll excuse us.

I love you.
I love you too.

Go.

See you soon.

Come here

Allan are filthy rich and
they're determined to keep him.

yourself may well be seen by court and law,
but you abandoned your son.

I did not abandon my son.

When his mother died, I sent him to London
to be with his grandparents,

because I felt to do
the best thing at the time

You sent him thousands
of kilometers away from you.

For his own good!

yea you've choose to remain there.
Austin, had to make a living.

it's very exciting life you lead, Allan.

Big game, hunting, go on safari ...

Seeing the salvaged land firsttime

Nobody blames you for choosing
this above your family.

I did not choose Africa
over my family.

to be perfectly honest, Allan,

in my opinion, Harry is far
better off with the grandparents.

You have plenty money,
will go to find schools ...

I'm not interested in
your opinion, Austin.

I'm his father,
He is my blood.

You need to tell me
wether I have a case or not.

You have to proof to the court that

you are a suitable and responsible parent.

what You need is money, Allan,
plain the other...

because they going to fight
you tooth and nail.

shure, I don't see any way that
you can get your son back. I'm sorry.

He raised is handsome,
but has a very rare dog.

It is a facocero.
A facocero!

Bartender, another one please.

Troubles?

normally I think to be
I trained to be a father?

Yea..

Good luck.
Thank you.

We were obviously in the
wrong place. Come Elizabeth....

... I don't want you to mix in ...

Captain, do not be silly.
If he is here we will find him

Can I help you, ma'am?

Yes...

We are looking for a gentleman
by the name Mr. Allan Quatermain.

Hi. I am Allan Quatermain.

No. I'm Allan Quatermain.

Please, this is a lady,
no smoking people ...

Ah, the American.
I think looking at the rate of background.

Are you Mr. Allan Quatermain?

My card.

This is Captain Good.
We are interested in going to Africa.

quite right

now if you could manage to pull
yourself from your liberation for a moment

I am Sorry, I am not in
the Safari business in...

Count Dracula...

They annoy me.

you curbed your tongue, sir,
or you deal with me

Ay ay, Captain!

There is a great deal of money for you.

to do that?

to help me find my father.

He's been kidnapped in Africa.

Africa is no place for a lady.

I am not afraid of anything,
Mr. Quatermain.

Especially when it comes
to save of my father's life

That completes
and unpleasant man

What was my father thinking to him?

his well think to a rude drunk
with absolute no manners.

and he most common sense?
What?

He makes apoint you
about you and Africa.

Is it absolutely necessary
you go?

Please do not start that again.
You know I made my mind up!

If Quatermain won't take us,
then we find somebody who will...

Good!
thank you

Oh, Praytor.

Bushell.

What brings you back
to dry land, Captain?

Well, ahmm this is my dearest
niece ... Elizabeth Maitland,

Praytor, Bushell.
M'am

Haunted.

Praytor and Bushell were with me
on HMS Hidalgo

Or was it in Kincardine?

Have many things to catch-up
I'll walk to the hotel.

Very well then, but make sure
you stay to the main streets.

Bushell, Nice to meet you.
Bushell, and where you are too?

Oh no!

Jaw, give it to me!

Give me the map, Miss Maitland.

Sorry, what are you talking about?
The map from your father. It belongs to us.

you are right?

Yea, Thank you.

You are welcome.

I did not realise, that your father
is Samuel Maitland,

professor of archeology.

that's right
Tell me what happened there

I told you. He has been kidnapped.
He sent me a letter.

Did he say where they might
be hold him?

Some place in southern Africa.

And I'm prepared to offer you a
great deal of money to take me there

Africa is a incredibly dangerous place,

quite far far remove
from the luxuries at home.

Elizabeth!

Thank God you're back.

Is anything all right?

yes somethings happened
Come quickly...

How is everything.
Yes I know

It was not a robbery.

The man in the alleyway ...

he was not after your purse

He was looking for something else.

Have you been attacked?
I'm fine, Captain

I think there is something you
not telling me, Miss Maitland.

Go...

Before he was kidnaped,
my father sent me something

What?

I am sure you have heard
of King Solomon mines

King Solomon,s mines do not exist,
they are a myth.

This map leads to the untold
wealth of the ancient Israelites.

My father spent the best part
of 30 years, looking for it

He told me to guard it
with my life.

may I see it?

I don't take it to Africa,
who ever kidnapped my father, will kill.

I do not think so.
What?

They sell these maps
to tourists in Cape Town.

no, it must be mistaken because
my father's life ...

depends on me getting
that map to an African tribe,

in some place called Sitandra's Kraal.

Sorry, the mines are a joke,
and this map ...

What is it, Quatermain?

well I can conceed,
that Professor Maitland

made some unique discovery,
but I know that mines do not exist.

I dn't care about the mines,

I care about my father

now will you help me to save him?

CAPE TOWN

huh a tourtle...

good God...
do they always live like this?

No, thank you, ma'am...

Quatermain!

I knew you would never
stay away from Africa longer

good to have you back.
this be back so...

only for short time
I'm visiting.

I'll believe when I see it.
Believe it.

stay out of trouble!
I will try.

you should run for governor.
oh too dangerous.

Hey! It is Quatermain.

Sambona.

Numza Quatermain.

Sambona, numza.

You're an old dog.

I knew you'd find
another woman.

You're wrong Khiva,
She is not my wife.

but she is so beautiful...

Yes, I know. But,
believe me, she is a bit difficult.

I could manage this

What did they said?

The weather has been terrible.

Miss Elizabeth Maitland,
Captain Good,

Khiva and Ventvogel.
Vent for short.

I have a job for you,
but you look a little busy.

aahh We are not.
We are ready for you

you would not gone believe it,
but we are looking for the mines.

It's her.

Did you see the map?
Niet, but she is traveling with others.

The old one

and Quatermain.

you recognise it?

oh Yes.

so Tell me about that Quatermain.

He arrive in this country twelve years ago.

He setup to my office straight
off the ship, nothing then a rifle.

I took him on
For a while, we did well.

And then?

He brought his wife on to Africa,
He had a child.

Then, he got careless.

He took his wife on safari.

she got mauled by a lioness
protecting her cubs.

of course he went crazy,

start of thinking he been punished
for all the killing he done

And then he turned on me.

What if we have to kill him?

let's just say he wan't return on me again...

you understand that the map
they carry is the property of Tsar?

I understand you need a guide
who knows Africa better...

than your two friends here from Siberia.

You will be our guide for 10%
of whatever we find.

25 And now say 22 and a half.

fine, deal.

Lady's and Gentlemen, the Bloem hotel.

Oh, there it is... It's pleasant enough

Miss Maitland, I trust you have
suitable clothing for a safari.

I belive I have suitable
clothing for a safari, Mr. Quatermain.

after you...

Thank you.

and What is this?
Ostrich Neck, sir.

Ostrich Neck?
you don't like it boss?

I do not know.

"Bon Apetit".

What time do we leave tomorrow?

At dawn.

Quatermain,

You're a disgrace.

I've I told you not to show your
ugly face around this parts again?

Mr. Quatermain, there is a
very large hairy gentleman

requesting your attention.

Yes, Miss Maitland,
and I smell him.

Why just stand up
and fight like a man?

Or, in your case,
as a woman.

would you excuse me.

Forgive me.

here gond to face!

Good! That's very good!

Try an African tree,
for a change.

Won't you going do something
To help him?

You can dance for your concubine,
but you not can ...

you Scottish ...

Captain, stop them!

What?

Already done you, Henry?

I don't know what you,
to drink.

Thank you, Captain.

so that is professor  Maitland
he is been held by a native tribe.

yes, ahm he call them the Kuakuani.

Did you ever heard about them?
No, I must say I haven't.

what they want with a professor, Maitland?

Well that's where it gets very interesting.

we need going to that team
Mr Quatermain?

Ms. Maitland, all thous
Sir Henry may not look like much

he is honorable and I would
trust this man with my life

All right.

And what do you think is genuine?

Henry ...

This journy isn't defined
locating mines and finding riches,

but saving my father's life.

I believe in cold, hard cash, Missy

And I belive that I am paying handsomely

to help me trade
this map for my father.

What you do after that
is up to you...

Good night Messrs.

You never learn deal,
Quatermain?

what are you talking?

Taking a woman out there ...

I heard everything.

Do you have the money?

They are leaving tomorrow.

Where to?

Sitandra's Kraal.

They are to meet a native
and give him a map.

CAPE TOWN

What do you reading?

The mystery of King
Solomon's the treasures

King Solomon's Mines
are part of ancient history.

like Captain Kidd's treasure,
or Atlantis.

Right, Quatermain?
Something like that.

Not deceive pulje.
Quatermain believes in the mines.

he even tried to find at once.
Really?

I was a kid.

You are almost 30ty
it was used to go,

and I never found one shred of evidence
to proof that the mines exist.

Yeah, but a good story sir

Wen you tell us about,
Miss Maitland?

Why not? To let pass the time.

Well, according to the Biblical account,

King Solomon ruled Judea
for 40 years.

He supposedly a very wise king

who united the land surround
Jerusalem into a single country.

And he built one temple to
the one God of the Hebrews,

it would to rival all the grand palaces
of Mesopotamia and Egypt.

So he sent his men
the far corners of the world

and they found a place where it was said
the ancestors of the ancient

They had a huge treasure trove
of riches of all kinds:

Diamonds, gold, emeralds, rubies.

That place was called Ophir.

And, in return, those riches
They were used

to adorn King Solomon's temple

and nothing in the world
could rival this.

However, it is said,
that only a small amount...

of what the men found in Ophir
was actually used in the temple.

And the rest is yet to be found.

Would you care to have some, Boss?

It Depends. What do you eat?

An African delicacy.

you know, more like your caviar.

Caviar?
yea.

Well, then I'll ... give it a try.

Not so bad... How do you call it?

Mopani worms.

Worms?

absolutly beautiful.

the Savannah, Miss Maitland.

truly Beautiful, is it not?

Yes.

so Let me take a look.

Honestly, Mr. Quatermain!

How does your wife tolerate
your uncivilized behavior.

Put this on. It just might help.

His wife died, Miss Maitland.

It happened a long time ago.

And, for your information,

I think she liked this...
uncivilized behavior.

What are you doing?

Determining whether you shall live or die.

She is reading your daughter's thoughts

If Gagool sees your daughter coming,
then you shall live.

If not...

What do you see, Gagool?

The vision is blurred.

It seems that
your daughter has failed.

Wait, I see something.

She travels with three white men
to Sitandra's Kraal

Good news.
Your daughter brings the map.

He shall live... for now.

you know, I do't understand, Twala,

What you want with the mines?
You have no need for their riches.

It is not riches that I crave.

you crave power:
Stone of the Ancestors.

But why? You are the king of
these lands. Of all these people.

Is not enough!

My father was banned from this place
and sent to the land of the white man.

I was raised amongst you.

if I know who you are.

And I know the best way to defeat you.

Hey, little guy ...
Come here.

Boss!
Khiva, Vent!

Miss Maitland, stop!
Do not touch those puppies!

They are alone. If we leave them here,
They will die.

Then shall be it.

Don't talk to me!

Listen, their mother is either dead
or right behind thad bushes,

waiting to come down on you-
or one of these antelopes.

Is this really necessary,
Quatermain?

Captain Good...
this is not your London high society,

where all you have at stake
is your reputation.

This here... it is your life
what is at stake!

All clear, Quatermain.
Thank you, Henry.

It's late... We need
to find a save place to camp.

all right.

I have never seen so many stars

It's really beautiful as here.

Thus seduces the savannah.

Khiva.
Numza.

Who take turns guard for tonight?
I take the first one.

ok Goodnight my friend.

Why we need a fire in this heat?

To keep predators away, Captain.

Oh I see. Well if you...
need me, just Call.

Good night.

I am beginning to see why
my father loves Africa so much.

It's breath taking.

Yes it is.

You mean to say,
we actually agree on something.

Supposed so.

Look at this.

Thank you...
for coming on this journey with me.

It's getting late...
Tomorrow we have a lot to ride.

all right

Good night, Mr. Quatermain.

Good night, Ms. Maitland.

Believe me, she is a lot more afraid
than you are of her

Isn't she doesn't.

are you all right?

All clear, Quatermain?

Nicely done, Henry.

When you find
a proper cat, let me know.

Good Morning!

A lovely day!
Did you sleep well, Elizabeth?

Henry, what's for breakfast?
Fillets painted.

How are you holding up?
just fine, Mr. Quatermain.

How much far that is Sitandra's Kraal?

about... three hours,
if we're lucky.

that are men.

the all Safety is my responsibility,
There has to be another way.

my Father's letter was very specific.

I have to make the change by myself.

she's right, Captain.

prefer Elizabeth to go alone?

We will be right behind
you the whole way.

If you see anything suspicious at all,
you yell as loud as you can...

and you run for cover,
you hear?

you be very very careful.

now go

Vent, behind those rocks.

Khiva, right side
behind the bush.

give map.

No... not until I see my father.

Give me map!

Not until
You show me my father!

Put the map down, Miss Maitland.

back away.

Quatermain- We got a problem.

I think this is our man
and he's dead?

Elizabeth! Run!

Cover me!

Miss Maitland!

get on, Miss Maitland!

com on.

Sergei! I'm hurt!

Come on! leave!

Elizabeth!

are you all right?

I don't like Russians...
And they knew about the map.

Russians?
What the hell Russians doing here?

I'm fine.

Elizabeth, you must tell him.

Tell me what?

For the last three years,

My father is presumed
of King Solomon's Mines

It has been financed
by Tsar of Russia.

I supose they think
the map belongs to him.

I didn't think he would be an issue!

OMG.

Petre is wounded!
Where were you?

You were supposed to cover us!

I was not hired to kill
for your precious Russia.

you had a shot on Quatermain
I know you had a shot.

I'm a tracker.
I track that's what I do

If you want to kill Quatermain,
you go ahead.

That's your departmenmt, not mine.

you'r a coward, McNabb.

you signed with us
you made that choice!

live with it.,..

Because, after today...
your friend Quatermain

wouldn't hesitate to kill you!

he headed inland.

the Tribes on the other side of those
Mountains are not very friendly.

we stay on the trail,
and let him do the work.

Everything is going to be fine.

Well, and how?
What are we going to do now?

Henry!
noo.

I know what you thinking, Quatermain.
but you can just forget about it!

It is time to visit an old friend.

Nooo.
Yes.

Momma Tuussee.

It is a sangoma.

Sir Henry.
how long has it been!

It don't we should be
talking to a witch doctor

We have no choice.

His father is a teacher.

Professor, actually.

Sir Henry... I think you've something
for me that might help.

A necklace.

he was a Kuakuani.

Very loyal to their king.

A man named Twala.

Twala holds your father.

you have a map.

Let me see it.

Follow the map... get the key.

What key?

The key to King Solomon's mines.

You will find the key
in the tomb of Virtuoso's

in the sands of the great desert.

Follow the path to Sheba's eye,

through her breasts and
into the valley of the Kuakuani.

The mine is there.

And Twala will be waiting.

And my father?

He too,
by the grace of the ancestors.

go, travel quickly

there isn't much time

What would happen in there...
and who is the Twala?

I don't know.

stages one way up...

Wait here a minute.

Who you are? And what do you want?

I am Umbopa.

You are heading north.
I was born in the north.

I haven't been home for a long time...
I will go with you.

I thank you...
but we don't need another bearer

I require no premium,
I can be of grate assistance...

just the same:
I don't need any more men.

I know this land very well, and
I've crossed the great desert before.

Khiva is chief bearer,
he tell you what to do

already anyone, it's enough...

we are now moving
in an uncharted territory.

Where few have gone
and even fewer have returned...

so if there is anyone in awe to turn back,
I suggest to do it now.

There's shame.

We'll all go with you.

Of course not, Quatermain.
We have no option.

Why do you think
African tribes to be interested

in King Solomon's mines?

They have no use Gold, Jewelry
and stuff like that.

It's a good question.

I think it's the Stone.

What are you talking about? What stone?

Legend tell that king Salomon's mines
contain an ancient relic.

The Stone of the Ancestors.

Do you think that's why
they holding my father?

They do say that one who holds
the stone rules all of Africa

Let's move out!

Do you see them?

All right...
This is where we dump the horses.

We let them go now, they have some
chance to get back to Sitandra's alive.

What do you mean
we are leaving the horses?

We're being followed, Captain.

so Henry.
Yes, Quatermain.

You, Vent and Khiva, put together only
what we absolutely need for the trip.

and get the rest together
to Boobath.

Captain,
keep to help, please?

Are we're going out there on foot?

Miss Maitland...
You should go back with the horses.

Momma Tuussee can arrange
save passage to Cape Town for you

What about my father?
I will find your father.

Look,
I need to apologize.

I should have told you about the Russians.

The truth is...
you have done not bad.

I also think

your father will be
very proud of you.

I hope so.

I need to see this through.
I am stay.

The horses are ready, Boss...
And so am I.

all right.

Khiva, you stay with me.

Vent, I mean you take
three barers,

I need you square movy area.

you Take two horses east,
two horses south.

This confuse the hell all these guys.

bring back a round and we
meet up tonight at Cascamba river.

All right.

and ber there!

I certainly hope you know
what you got yourself into.

I do.

There goes our transporters

Take your shoes off.

We want them follow horses, not us.

They were just here
few hours ago at most.

over here

Tracks.
They went this way.

No, wait.

Here... Two sets of tracks.

what now?

Which way, McNabb?

Stop wasting your time McNabb!
Which way?

Quatermain released the horses.

There are a ruse.
They went this way... On foot.

How do you know?
I see no boot prints.

There feet made those tracks...

Believe me,
another way Quatermain thinks.

bad ascent

Let me help you, Boss.
nonsense... I get in my face same

Sure this is my face same?

It's really amazing,
we are walking in a place

that hasn't changed
in thousands of years.

Most people only
see desolation in the desert.

I can't believe
It's taken me this long to get here

Why didn't you ever asked your father
if you could to join?

I did... all the time.

But, like you, he thought...

his fragile daughter
will be best let home.

was too dangerous for me to go.

You don't see much, huh?

This is ridiculous.

Quatermain, it's been a long day.

Why don't we camp?
We try to remain invisible, Captain

This is way to out in the open

We wait for dige
water will gone.

Someone is coming.

Sambona, Vent!

Sorry, Boss.
What happened?

I let them serial moles
but I don't think they followed

It seems our Russian friends
have a tracker.

Maybe it's best to follow.

Well what's the difference if we camp?

They know that we're here.

At least, we will be rested.

Yes, is an excellent idea, Captain.

Khiva, take the bearers, erect the tents,
Gather wood build a fire.

Yes, Boss.

So you finally come to your senses.
something like that

They are still asleep
This is the chance.

Don't take him for a fool!

He knows we are following him
He will already made sure of that.

The map is the property
of Mother Russia.

I take my orders directly from the czar,

not from you!

I thought we agreed that
let Quatermain take the risk

that a spear he get from a native?

We simply follow
No... We take the map now.

I want as few people as
possible getting to those mines.

Go impatience, my friend already
got his man shot.

And your procrastination is a weakness.

Colonel,

they were never here.

Ivan ...

We do it my way now?

I pray facing towards home
each morning.

It gives me strength.

How long has it been since you been there?

I was forced to leave
When I was just a small child

you just decided to go back?

The gods have foretold,
they have given me you.

me??

I don't understand...

We will shown the way.
You must have faith.

I do not think the gods
concern themselves to much for me.

The gods know you very well,
Quatermain.

The gods smile upon you

and they know your destiny,
even if you do not.

What are you two talking about?
Nothing.

I just try to figure it out

did you?

Actually no.

I think he's sad.

The kind of sadness that keeps him
from sharing his life with others.

In many ways,
He's just like you.

Unable to adapt,

but he does know what to do about it ether.

is that right?

Yes... it is.

You wanted to see me?

I hear: you saw the white man Maitland
without me.

For Why?

I had to feel him again

to see his daughter
more clearly.

So what?
Did you see more clearly?

Oh yes, I feel that she is
still on the way to us.

What happens, Gagool?

A white Man accompany her.

You should fear this man.

Because?

That I do not know.

but he will be an obstacle for your desire

So I have to kill him.

Of course, soon you get
what you want, my King.

I hope for you, Gagool.

Yes.

Nice watch, Boss.

Thank you.
It is also your necklace.

Do you want to trade for it?

My dear Khiva,
this watch was given to me...

by Her Majesty on my retirement,
It is very special.

Oh, this is too.

very well... it's a deal.

This is beautiful. What does it stand for?

I do not know.

I bought in a souvenir shop
in Cape Town.

ehh Khiva ...

How far do you think it is
before we get to the tomb?

It's hard to say.

What do you think the cobra represent?
A marker...

Hopefully, the entrance to the mines.

I don't understand. A cobra?

I do ... an actual monument,

a geological rock formation,

or... it could be a warning.

a warning for what?

I do not know.
But we'll find out.

These tracks are fresh...
not more then an hour ahead.

good

How long, Sir Henry?
That's piracy!

Quatermain!

Look!

aah be there...

so This is the Cobra's head,

but there is not much else.

We have get what the hell we lookup for.

We should have ridden those horses
until they die....

The vultures would have given us a way

Bloody idiot.

McNabb!

I think maybe you do not want
us to catch up?.

I think maybe you are with Quatermain.

go ahead...

And when the wind comes up
and close these tracks away,

You wander around in this desert
and get together lost ,

until the vultures come
and pick out eye balls.

Go on now...

No have to point a gun of me

For the ancestors, you know.
For you, Sir Henry,

who has the foresight to pack
a necessity of all necessities. Whiskey.

Yes, same right back at you, Admiral.
Captain.

Congratulations. You just be promoted
I'll drink to that.

I can't just stand around here
doing nothing, looking at rocks.

We have to do something.

This book explains why
King Solomon hid the Key

in a mine
in the middle of the desert.

It does? What does it say?

it turns out... King Solomon was building

such an incredibly ornate temple,

because he had fallen in love
with a certain queen.

Queen Sheba.

When Sheba traveled to Jerusalem
to meet with Solomon,

They fell in love, completely
passionately.

But Sheba's people did not approve.

She was after all an African queen.

And they were so different, came from
such different places.

One steeped culture
and tradition of African...

And, the other one...

So when She went to Africa,

Solomon did not give up,
he was so in love ...

that he sealed mines
and offered the Key to Sheba

in exchange for her becoming his wife.

Actually, he tried to bribe her.

The man was so desperate

that he sent the richest men
to wait for their reply.

And they waited for years

but Sheba can not
bear to leave her people

so Solomon sealed the Key
and returned forever.

What happened to Solomon and Sheba?

They never saw each other again.

Sad.

It is.

I wonder what it's like...

feel so passionate about someone

He would sacrifice everything.

I put my father's life in your hands.

Miss Maitland! You are right?

I think so.

Elizabeth!
You are all right?

I get something.

Tight.

By the ancestors!

Help me.

No key.

Quatermain! Come here.

Is what?

Henry noo! Do not touch it.

Not touch anything.

Elizabeth? ... Elizabeth?

Not screem.

Captain ... Wake up. Wake up!

Captain.
What is? Where am I?

wah...  ahh... okay

Where is Elizabeth?

With the Russians.

The Russians?
If.

And there was another man.
What a man?

Dark hair, dress like you.
A hunter.

McNabb.

Tracks gone west.

If we hurry, we can them
load up everyone!

This is not a good idea.

Why not?

Low of water.

If we go hunting them now,
We have no idea how long it takes

Umbopa says the water that way.

We have to find her.

You have the map
and the key to the mines.

you ask me no need to go looking for them,
is them must go looking for us.

But I did not ask you, Henry!

Vent, Khiva, let's move!

You are not thinking, Allan!

Violence solves nothing.

We must make the girl our first priority!

But we wonâ€™t save her if we die of thirst.

The only water in this part of the Desert

It is the oasis at
Queen of Sheba's eye.

Like all creatures,
we must go there to drink.

And so must the men
who got Miss Maitland.

He's right.

Let's move out!

Tell me again Ms Maitland.

I don't know anything.
You're wasting your time.

The map that your father sent you
belongs to the Tsar.

We want it back.

Well, I havenâ€™t got it.

so I supose you have no luck.

and so about you.

Wait.

Wait a minute.

You gave Quatermain the map
don't you?

What if I did?

We were partners once, He and I

you can,t trust him...

you can say what you want...

And you can treat me how you like.

Quatermain is never going
to give you the key.

there is a key?

We find Quatermain.
We offer you a deal.

The map and the key
for her life.

what if he want to do it?
how did you heard them?

Quatermain is a honourable man.

And is a sucker,
for a beautiful face.

He will trade you for the wealth
of King Solomon's Mines, right?

Let's circle back

And when they come,
you get Miss Maitland back again.

I hope you are right

How far do you think to Sheba's Eye?

I certainly hope you know where to go,
because I am lost.

You won't find the way we got.
It's a large desert.

Don't worry, We'l find Miss Maitland.
You must have faith in the ancestors.

Faith?

You know, for a wise man, you put a
lot of faith in these ancestors.

And for a wise man, you don't put enough!

keep moving!

Do you Pray, Professor?

I do.

You speak English?

I speak any language you need to hear.
I am here to warn you.

you must pray to God!
Pray for your daughter.

What do you talking about?

There are men who want what Twala wants.
They say, it belongs to them.

They have taken your daughter.

If they don't bring her back,
they will take mines.

and if they take the mines...

Why you telling me this,
why not telling to Twala?

Because it seems big change for our people,
but only if she survives.

your daughter's destiny is not written,
there is much spirit about.

I know.

pray that she survives.

or you will never get out of here alive.

Never.

how far ahead are they?

An hour... to the most

I don't think you manage to make it.

We must leave him here.

Give him some water.

Why? Dead men don't drink.

Why do you follow him?

ever hear of march of death?

two years ago, the Tsar ordered 150 of
his men to march all the way across Russia

from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok.
Just for fun.

It was middle of winter.
Suicide, and that they knew it.

But they went. Only one man made it.

And it was him.

Don't waste your bullets.

Miss Maitland, you got no water?

I think you should come back.
I prefer to die.

If you die so does your father.

Come on.

We must insist.

keep on.

One foot in front the other, Captain.

Look at the captain.

You go to keep move.
when you keep her.

You must keep moving, Captain. Get up.
I can't go on now

If you stay here, you die.
Let me die!

A man of the sea like yourself
is no one to do die in the desert?

You're insult of water.

you boys, fight now.

Water?

I smell water.

I smell water.

Where you go?

crazy English fool,
you have found that water.

They were just here
The sand is still wet.

The tracks lead away
They have gone

I don't like it
what can I do

We have her.

Drop[ your weapons, Gentlemen.

We are arround you.

I say drop your weapons and let her go.
Wait.

Listen to me very carefully, Mr Qaterman.

Before I count to ten, you and your men
will walk down to us, very slowly.

Leave your weapons raised
above your head.

If you don't, I will shoot miss Maitland.

have you understood?

The count begins now: one... two...

Don't play games, Mr Quatermain,
he means what he says.

just give us the map and the key.
and we let miss Maitland go.

Eight...
All right.

I am coming down.

We all coming down
don't do it!

I trust in an officer of the tsar
is a man of his word.

We are soldiers,
Mr Qaterman, not murderers.

I said: drop your weapons!

I will give you what ever you want,
but I will not drop my weapon!

then I will kill her.
It seems then you were in a taff part, Sir.

one trigger pull...
you will never see the key nor the mines.

with that matter you will be dead...

And you lose your lady-friend.

Why you just shoot me? Then that one
blow you to pices while you reload.

I want the map, and I want the key.

As you wish, Sir.

take it!

I am sure you understand Mr Quatermain,
we need some distance. Let's move.

Don't do anything stupid, Miss Maitland.

Aahh run!

You are all right?

vent has been hurt

It's just my leg boss.

Your daughter lives,
and continues her journey to our land.

all this just not make you happy?

Yea I am happy that she is alive. But I am...

I'm not happy that she is
come here to save me.

I should never get her put her live at risk.

You are right to worry about her.

Twala is an unpredictable man.

It is very dangerous that she come here.

What kind of a father am I, to put my
own daughter in such jeopardy?

Other the question is:

What kind of father are you...

that your daughter would
risk her life to save you?

Thank you.

you should never have
traded the key for me.

if I hadn't you be dead now.

He is quite right, Elizabeth.
These men are barbarians.

They fear for nothing to get to the mines.

I like to get hold of that McNabb,
and take the map back.

He is well gone.

So the next landmark on the map,
are breasts of Sheba.

What do you suppose there?

There they are.

The queen of Sheba's
breasts I believe.

I haven't ever met a women of thouse.

Now we have to do
is find McNabb.

So you say know these mountains?

Then you take the lead.

Don't look so worried McNabb.
Quatermain has no idea where we are.

And this is... Sheba's smile.

We walk through here
down to Sheba's breasts.

Sheba's smile.
not her smile I'm read about.

its her teeth.

We are ahead of them now.

Come to papeims.

We setup on these rocks.

Watch your step.

Khiva, high there, left.
Captain Good, go here.

V, you stay with me.

Miss Maitland, If thing go sad,
and I have to move, you stay right here.

you stay quiet, understand?

What now?

Take cover. Right now.

McNabb, drop the bag and move on!

All right, take it easy!

Drop the bag, McNabb, and move on!

Cover  Quatermain.

I'll got the bag!

Khiva noo. What are you going...

Khiva, ga.

Cover me, Henry.

Take a shoot, McNabb.

Now.

Let me see.

It is good.

You'll be fine, Khiva,

is fine...

don't ... don't to die please....

gods of the Earth, Sun and Stars.

take our brother and
make from his body a great tree.

Let it be a reflection, on what
Khiva's life was on this earth.

May I join you?
sure

I could not sleep.

I kept thinking about Khiva.

Me too.

When I was a little girl, my mother died.

I was so confused, and frightened.

right after her funeral my father came
to my room to comfort me.

He told me that my mother's spirit
would be always with us.

to prove his point he take to me outland,
carried me outside and...

we lay on the ground
anf looked at the stars.

He pointed to one, and he said:

Every time, God closes the door on life ...

He opens a window into heaven.

So let the Light shine down forever.

that's lovely.

It helped.

What is, Quatermain?
Umbopa is gone.

No tracks, sign, nothing,
... just disappear.

What do you think?

I do not know.

Maybe just go home?

I make a fire, make some coffee.

common, wake up.

Give me the knife.

We are partners now, you and me.

I'll do it.

It is not about the money, McNabb.

I want the stone of the ancesters.

you won't believe a stone
as an evil power?

I am here for the tsar.

He believes that the tribes
of Africa believe it as power.

That is enough.

bite on this.

And hold still!

There is ... there is ...

What is it, Quatermain?

Don't move.

You don't suppose
there Cannibals?

What did they want?
I do not know.

Maybe this is the tribe holding my father.

I am afraid it's getting back to worse.
get a lot worse for you, McNabb.

Just a hit, I will release him from sufferings.

We are the ones, who care about killing.

I will save you the trouble.

my people: the Kuakuani's...
review me carefully.

I am Ignosi...

...you legitimate King.

What is he saying?

Umbopa says, he is the is king.

Umbopa the King?

you don't remember me anymore?

When I was a little boy...

My mother and me, we left our home.

How can I believe you?

a mother with her kid should

cross the big desert?

Yea. And I returned...

in order to claim my throne.

Twala killed my father

and robbed me of my rights!

There is only one proof for You

to show: that you are your father's son.

This is proof which you are asking for

Why are you protecting these whites?

They are my guardians and servants.

And these two...

are my slaves.

I am nobody's slave.
what is it some kind of a joke?

crouch down.

The Kuakuani's will kill any
intruder to her land.

If you want to live, you must do what I say.

drop down.

Ignosi, our king is returned.

Is perfect. They will lead us right there.

where do you think they take us to?

weâ€™re go meet the man
who killed Umbopa's father

Twala?
Ay, seems like that.

I am sorry for not telling
you about my birth sooner.

Why didn't you?

I was not sure if you would come
with me to this place.

Well Wait...

So you planed this all along?

The gods have foretold that
you would help me to be king.

In exchange I will help you
to find this place

Trade is my father come into this?

M'Lenge has told me Twala
holds a white man in prison.

He is still alive.
When I am King, he will be free.

What if you don't become king?

Quatermain, may I have the key?

What are you doing?

This key is the only thing I have
to help my father.

The key is all I have to win
my birthright and defeat Twala.

Twala is a cruel king, Miss Maitland.

He kills people and steal their land.

If you give him to the key...
he'll find the stone of the ancestors.

And the stone will give him
the power to talk to the gods.

If that happens,
there will be no stop again.

I think we can trust him, Elizabeth.

We met under the force of the Sun ...

to celebrate the power of the Kuakuani's .

there you see the white man.

full of lies and deceit.

This man...

lied against your king.

This is not a good time for a sacrifice.

He did not bring what he has promised.

The ancestors tell me...

that the key be brought to us soon.

Have patience, my king.

The time of patience is over.

Kill him.

Who dares...

to disturb this celebration?

who dare to disturb this celebration?

I am Ignosi, the rightful King.

You are a deceiver.

kill them.

there is no reason for violence.

My father was Cohadi, your king.

The father Twala has killed him.

My mother fled with me into the desert

Now I am back home.

You are telling that you are the king.

who can confirm this?

I remember his father

and I know, Ignosi is our king.

An old man.

I have thousands of warriors

which say that I am king.

You know the will of the ancestors.

The key Umbopa, give Twala the key.

The daughter of the white man

has brought the key.

I give Gagool the key to keep...

until we have decided who becomes king.

And you let free the white man.

I claim the throne from you to.

I request Nomolos, fight to live and death

You may choose one man to fight for you
I choose one of my slaves to fight for me

Who is left the live at the end
his master shall be king

where is Elizabeth?

She is preparing the food,
with the other service.

What do they want with us?
Your heads on a stake.

You know at this stage
I don't care much.

just a long sit right beside yours.

Give me your weapons.

That means you do, soldier.

Everyone else.

That white man, Quatermain...
he is the one?

Give it to me.
What is that my king?

Give me the key to the mine

If your warrior wins Nomolos ...
I want it.

My king, will be wise not test my magic

Let's see how they use it.
You are making a big mistake.

All right... I agree

at my view, the string is
brought up by the neck

But Umbopa is a compassionate man,
do you have a good night sleep.

of course, I hope the mosquitoes
bite a million holding you

If you are hungry, you can just
bite each others noses open.

Shut off.

I feel so ashamed.

Father, you have nothing to be ashamed of.
I should never written that letter.

But I was afraid, Elizabeth.

I know, I understand.

I thought it would... buy me time
give me a chance to escape.

I should never send it
if you hadnâ€™t sent it, I wouldn't be here now.

...and I put you, and those men
who helped you, into such danger.

Hello Sir, it's really good to see you.

I can not thank you enough, Allan

is anything all right?

Twala has chosen his warrier
to fight for him.

And what about Umbopa?
Who is going to fight for him?

Now is the time...

For Nomolos.

a battle to the death.

Only one of them will survive...

and his master will king.

This is not your fight.

I am going give you one more chance
to walk away. Take all whites and leave.

I won't harm you.

And Umbopa, what about him ?

I'll deal with Umbopa
in my own way.

and I will fight, as agreed.

Then you are a fool.

take your weapon...
and fight my warrior, as agreed.

Or I will kill you myself.

cut me down.

cut me down.

Kill the white devil.

Come on,  Quatermain. Do it.

is too late.

buy an option now
for the rest way of course.

You rely on all your dream which you need.

tell he Umbopa he's a noble king.

And you need the good girl.

Don't ... Please, don't die.

Quatermain...
Noo stop fight.

Trust me.

I got it.

Go ahead... What?
Not look at her.

I'm not afraid of a witch.

I am not afraid of your magic.

I am an officer of the tsar.

I will hold your look... as long as I want...

You do not intimidate me...

Get a breath.

and again.

Now stop breathing.

Look at me.

Look at me.

Your friend search
the stone of the ancesters.

You do not. Why?

I do not seek power over African people.

You seek wealth ... which
in the end gives you power.

You are wise.
you are flat to me.

The white who fights for Ignosi
you can not trust him.

He envy him.

So long as he envy him,
you must follow him.

Go.

Your journey does not end here.

will I find what I seek?
Yes.

But you can never possess it.

The toast...

to Sir Henry.

Sir Henry.

The wildest, bravest, most
reverend crazy of all fool ever lived.

and my friend.

I am here to serve you, my King
If you will have me.

I must tell about Gagool.

When I was held by Twala...

this woman was the only person
to show me any compassion.

You may sit with us.

I know you done much for me...

But I have one final favor to ask.

As long as men are interested in the
power of the stone of the ancestors...

my people will not be safe...
It must be destroyed.

You want me to destroy the stone?
that is so.

of the ancestors.
You have a strong voice will bring you.

Listen. Trust.

You will find what you seek.

Here we go.
