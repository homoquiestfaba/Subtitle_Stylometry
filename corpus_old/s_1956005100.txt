Before my mom died,

she told me I wasn't dumb.

I was just a slow learner.

She was a smart lady.

That's what my dad says.

I remember once she told me,
ever since the Civil War,

people in the South
had this problem...

they felt inferior, real
sensitive about people

criticizing their lifestyles
or education or whatnot.

But there's no need to
feel inferior, she said.

Not everybody's meant to be a
doctor, an artist, whatever.

There's nothing wrong with
being an average kid.

Luke.

You don't want to
have to go back

and re-do another year.

No.

You'd rather it was
all over, right?

School, math problems...

Yeah.

I'm sorry, I'll bring it tomorrow.
I did it.

I just forgot.

Besides being here...

Normal.

Spending a lot of
time with Jonah.

Jonah?

My boyfriend.

Right.

Um...

Is he...

redhead, right?

Yeah that's him.
Cute guy.

Yep.

Lucky me.

I never had him.

You wouldn't.

He's gifted.

Oh.

He leaves in August.

College?

Yep.

Um... forever.

We've known each other
since we were four.

Wow.

Your families know?
More or less.

I just... Nobody
really talks about it.

It's not that big of a deal.
Okay.

Anyway, it doesn't matter.

I'm not that upset about it.

Everybody knew he was
gonna leave, so...

it's not that big of a surprise.

Yeah?
Yeah.

He's better than
all of this, so...

Here.

I like it here.
Different strokes.

So... why do you
think he's better?

Um... okay... so...

He did this little
painting of a watermelon

when he was, like, four.

It was supposed to
be a watermelon.

Like, a slice of watermelon.

You really couldn't tell what it was.
I thought it was a ladybug.

But his teacher said it
reminded her of modern artists.

She gave his parents a
hundred bucks for it.

He was only four.

He's good at everything.

I'm sure he's not
good at everything.

Fine.

He sucks at sports.

Well...

Lots of people.

Anyway, he's better now.

A little.

I taught him a few things.

I taught him how to swim.

You were on the
swim team, right?

Yeah, and baseball.

His parents signed
him up for baseball.

You can imagine how that went.

Um...

He pissed himself on
the way to practice.

He was six.

It wasn't, like, recently.

He did my homework for me.

And I helped him.

We made a deal.

And you've been
together ever since, huh?

Yeah.

We like each other.

That's nice.

It's like...

What's the word for when...

You know, those rhinoceroses
and the little birds

live on them and eat the
bugs off the skin...

Symbiotic.

Yeah, that.

I'm the rhino.

And the bird...

I'm sorry.

So what about you.

What do you want to do?

Any ideas?

Anything you'd like to do?

No.

I don't know.

Haven't figured that out yet.

Well that's okay.

Not really.

It's normal.

Do your homework, Luke.

Stop! You have to study!

I remember, when we
were in third grade,

we had to write autobiographies.

Jonah asked his parents
what he was like

when he was a baby.

They talked about it and decided

that it would be a good time
to tell him he was adopted.

They thought he'd be upset

or that he'd feel
unwanted or angry.

I think he was relieved.

He said his parents told
him he was special.

He was a gift from God.

I guess that's what most
parents tell their kids.

"You're special."

"You're a gift from God."

"You can do anything
you set your mind to."

Before that, he was lonely, would
sit by himself at lunches.

He asked people why
they didn't like him,

why he didn't fit in.

He wanted to.

Then all of the
sudden, he was fine.

He'd been lonely.

Now, he was just...

alone.

And he understood why.

He wasn't meant to be here.

And he knew, one
day, he would leave.

Fine.

They said it'd be three thousand
dollars, parts and labor.

It's more than she's
worth, apparently.

Maybe you wanna trade her in.

Get something you
can actually drive.

I'll fix her.

Seems like a lot to
pay for college.

Well, he wants to leave home,

so I said fine, do whatever.

Get the loan. I don't care.

I ain't paying for it.

You sure you want to go
all the way up north?

That's what he decided.

It's cold up there.

Hey, Luke!

Connecticut, New York,
wherever, Detroit.

They're very cynical.

Think they're better
than everybody else.

Well, he'll fit right in.

That's what I think, anyway.

I don't know.

You know Suzi's son.

He went off to college,

spent a whole lot of
money on a good school.

Where is he now?

Right here, right back
where he started from,

waiting tables.

Where'd all that money get him?

Nowhere.

It's just a total waste.

Casserole.

What you been doing
since school's out?

Work.

Summer school.

They made you take
summer school?

Yeah.

Failed a couple things.

Well, that's all right.

You tried your best.

Not smart like
that son of yours.

Well, now smart
isn't everything.

You know, I saw a bumper sticker
the other day, on a car.

It said, "my son's not
on the honor roll",

"but I'm proud of him anyway."

And I thought to myself,
yeah, that is so true.

Hey, dad.

Forget your mom.

She means well.

She just...

doesn't think before
she talks some times.

She says I think too much.

She says you can't enjoy life

if you spend too much
time thinking about it.

Maybe.

The truth is, I idolize him.

I think he's perfect.

I think, I would give
up everything for Luke.

We both have no idea
where we're headed,

what we'll do,
what we'll become.

But it tortures me,
and he moves forward.

A few days ago, I was
talking to my dad,

and I asked him, if
he could go anywhere,

where would it be?

And he said, "I'm
fine right here."

I asked him, "Don't you want to see
other places, or other countries?"

And he said, "There's enough
to see right here in America."

It's funny.

Some people feel so
comfortable in one place,

and others feel trapped.

An old cliche:

"the grass is always greener
on the other side."

But not for everyone.

Not for some people.

Some people, I've found,

prefer the shade of
their own backyard.

To want something
different is, maybe,

to want to be
frightened or unhappy.

To know that you are not
a part of any order...

no community, no home,
and to move forward,

never at peace, from
one thing to the next.

I think of the animals in
the yards and farms nearby,

horses, cows.

What a happy life.

Quiet.

Resigned to the day-to-day,
in a single space.

Same grass, same sky.

Oblivious.

No thoughts of a higher
power, or tomorrow,

or another place, or
of anything else.

I think: what a gift.

What peace.

They're on me.

He likes you.

That boy.

No, he doesn't.

Of course he does.

Why wouldn't he?

Trying to get rid of me?

No.

I don't want to be
with anybody else.

No.

Here.

You can't do this, because...

You can't factor four
out of the whole thing.

Only the top.

So you do four, X,

plus four over eight X.

Get it?

A couple hours.

I didn't know whether to
put him on the team or not.

His father says he needs
physical activity.

I was just afraid he's
get his feelings hurt.

He's so much smaller
than the other kids.

He seems to be having
a good enough time.

I guess that's what matters.

Ahh!

That's okay.

Keep your eye on the ball.

You got it?

Ready?

My dad said he would help me

with the down-payment on a car.

He said I needed something
sturdy, Japanese...

He said America can't keep up.

Something used with
a few miles on it,

but something that would drive.

And someone will take my old car

for a few thousand dollars,

and I'll take someone else's.

And I started to
think about Jonah,

and about his birth
mother, and his mom,

and passing him from one
person to the next,

and wanting him to be mine.

So I bought a camera, and
I took pictures of him.

Jonah said he heard a quote
somewhere that said,

"if it wasn't photographed,
it never existed."

I don't know who said it.

He's full of quotes.

I call him a smarty-pants.

He said, "They're not my ideas."

"They're other people's."

"I'm just borrowing them."

The music you were
playing sounded nice.

Thanks.

That something you come up with?

No.

Thought you might've wrote it.

I need to dust your room.

Fine.

You doing anything today?

Picking up Luke when
he's done with work.

What y'all gonna do?

I don't know.

What is there to do?

I mean...

You gonna have to
split up, or...?

Oh.

No.

I'd hate to see that happen.

I don't want to talk about it.

You don't have to get upset.

It's okay.

You're gonna be okay.

Make new friends, keep the old.

One's silver, the other's gold.

I don't know, Jonah.

It's just a saying.

It's stupid.

It doesn't mean anything.

I'm not stupid.

I never said...

I'm your mother.

I made my mother cry.

Eh...

She cries easy.

Yeah.

I feel very...

unrelated to them.

She asked me if we
were staying together.

Fingers crossed.

I don't know.

I think she'd rather
us stay together

if it meant I'd stay.

She just wants to torture
you for a couple more years.

Yeah.

There you go.

Signed by the whole team.

I wish you'd ask me not to go.

Too late now.

I could change my mind.

Stop it.

It'd be simpler.

I'm scared.

Don't be.

You can always come back.

This place isn't going anywhere.

I'm not going anywhere either.

I don't know why I
have to be like this.

I don't know why I
can't just care

about the things everyone
else cares about.

Like what?

I don't know.

Barbecues?

Yeah.

Please tell me not to go.

No.

I wish you would.

Tough.

Tough luck.

Not gonna happen.

Jonah read me a line from a book

he was reading.

It said, "Happiness
serves little purpose",

"except that it makes
unhappiness possible."

I once asked my dad how you know

you've found the right person,

and he said, "You just know."

"You find someone you
don't mind being around,"

"going places with, watching a
movie, sleeping next to..."

"Someone who isn't like you,"

"someone who makes you better,"

"who you forgive for
being different,"

"for not seeing the world
the way you see it."

We'll try,

see if things can last.

But things don't last.

He'll meet other people,

much more interesting than me.

And they'll love him.
