i always thought mike

Was the perfect guy for me.


And now he's just

Perfect in bed.

oh, you're killing me.


i still think that beth and i

Were made for each other.

[heavy breathing].

I don't want a divorce.

i've just never really

Been a sex maniac.


I never felt that comfortable

About my body.

you know,

If it wasn't for sex,

Franny and i would have

A perfect relationship.

I don't mean perfect...


But there's more good

Than bad.

She's just shut everything out.

it's just that i have

Different kinds of desires.

Desires you know that...

That can't be met

By my husband... Or won't.

[heavy breathing].

she just got different.


She does these kinky things.

I'm not very comfortable

With those things.

[heavy breathing].

[heavy breathing].



oh my god! Oh my god!

look at me...

Look at me, mike.

[heavy breathing].

uhm, i don't believe this.

uhm, sure you will.

Your girlfriend won't.


[water gushing].

[dog barking].

hi.

hi.

how did it go?

okay.

And you?

brutal.

Music.

[door grinds].

you smell so good.

we don't have much time.

They're going to be

Here soon.

we never have much time

Anymore, do we?

Mike and beth,

They took the time,

Two weeks in paradise.

to repair a crumbling

Marriage.


she's gone.

She's a million miles

Away from me.

mike!

Come on, baby.

We've got to go.

You're not done?

come on! Come on!

come on!

i thought i was done.

[water running].

Music.

It up?

i don't know.

no, no, i mean,

Really patched it up.

Found true marital happiness

Like us.

Knows such bliss.

but then i've got...

I got to...

The deal i got.

honey, come on.

[glass breaks].

[children laughing in distant].

your turn.

what did you do with

Your tie?

Honey, i like this tie.

Did you call the babysitter,

Told her to come early?

You did, didn't you?

Alright.

11 years, ha!

11 years i've watched

Shelly change.

No, not change. She's...

I look at her

And it's like looking

At a stranger.

please, have some now.

It's ready.

you guys

I really hope that

They patch things up

On this trip.

You know, fix the marriage.

they'll be good.

They'll be fine.

speaking of fixing things,

I'm thinking about

A boob job,

Another cup size-->

artie...

you know,

We were really surprised -->

well, no. Don't say we

Because frankly

I still don't understand

That you couldn't see that

They were really

In trouble but -->

how are we doing

With the drinks?

what do you mean we?

don't say we.

guys -->

no. I think, no...

What they did was good.

I think good for them,

Good for them,

Taking a trip,

I think -->

oh yeah, get some out

Of the way -->

absolutely, yeah.

experience some new things.

reliving in the past.

coming back to the same

Old shit.

[doorbell rings].

we're not home!

i'll get it.

speak of the devils.

here we go. Let's see.

what are you wearing?

alright, you -->

oh, i'd recognize

That squeal

From anywhere.

here they are.


whoa! Look at -->

whoa! Chiquita banana

the gang's all here!

chiquita banana.

How are you?

buenas noches.

[indistinct chattering].

Thanks for the postcards.

You look beautiful.

surprised, maybe?

i only drink margaritas now.

well, the blender is broke.

Franny, fill it up.



guys, it's incredible.

It was so exciting.

The beaches -->

[indistinct chattering].

i just want to say

Welcome home, guys.

Welcome home.

Good to see you again

And being around you guys

Right before you left was

Kind of like -->

day without sunshine.

more like a root canal

Without novocain.



will you tell them?

tell us what?

i think we should tell them.

Tell us what?

what?

yeah.

well -->

what do you -->

who's your travel agent?

What?

we're getting a divorce.

oh, fuck you.

You are not.

Bull.

It's true.

guys, i mean five years.

there are going to be

Some problems,

You work them out, right?

we're sure.

what?

we're sure.

you guys are acting like

This is some kind of

Joyous announcement,

Got a baby or something.

we weren't happy.

nope.

But now we are, you see.

Once we decided to break up,

We became friends again.

well, i don't know whether

To say congratulations,

I'm sorry or go to hell.

go to hell!

yeah.

just say you understand.

well, i don't.

but anyway, let's go.

We're gonna be late

For dinner.

yeah, i'm really hungry.

where are we going?

italian.

honey, would you get

My jacket?

i'm gonna need some grease.

yeah.

where are we going?

[indistinct chatter].

you're getting divorced

From each other.

Not from you guys.


i'm sorry, man.

I mean the babes there

Were great.

You've got to go sometime.

i know.

okay?

so what were the men like?

ill tell you.


really?

guys, wait up.

it's the happiest

I've seen 'em in

A long time.

i think she looked

Like a whore.

maybe.

i think mike had that

Kind of hollow look that

Divorced men get, you know,

Kinda like a hungry wolf.


well...

They're still our friends.

we're happy aren't we,

Artie?

mmm...

Sure we are.

artie wants to do things

That i just don't always feel

Comfortable doing and...

It's so funny.

It's like...

We have the opposite problem

Of most people, you know?

I think i end up feeling

Impotent and he is the one

Who ends up

Feeling frustrated.

Music.

is that interesting

Or what?

yeah, but i think your

Shoulders is a little

Bit more interesting.

Just breathe!

Be with me now!

I like the strap.

This dress, hon?

mm-hmm.

[soft moaning].

what are you doing?

seducing my wife.

oh really?

i think i'm getting

Seduced by my husband.

that's a good thing.

is it?

Honey?

yeah.

why don't you go take

Your clothes off?

okay.

those are everywhere.

alicia.


the last year, it's...

God, it's been a nightmare.

Suddenly i'm married to the

Frigid witch of the west.

Just a catch-up day.

I guess i'm just tired.

Good night.

Music.

I've left you?

I haven't gone anywhere.

I'm right here.

You left me long ago.

oh man, you are losing...

You are fucking losing -->

No priority with you.

With all our friends,

I mean nothing to you.

You look at me and

You see right through me.

Where are you going to go?

In a bar?

Do you realize

How much you drink?

yeah, i drink whenever

We fight.

I drink a lot.



I'm sorry.



[heavy breathing].




people share their beds,

Their bodies and their...

Their dreams and...

After a while

They just drift apart.


[breathing heavily].

you're such a porn king.

no, beth.

i don't wanna fight anymore.

me too, babe.

i know but it's

Just when

You do that with me -->

yeah, it's me.

It's always me.

im talking to you.

you never do anything

Wrong, do you, beth?


Music.

[sobbing continues].

you feel good?

yeah.


Will, will.

mm-hmm.

What?

why don't we kiss anymore?

oh, hon...

mom...

shit, hang on!

what?

wait a minute, honey.

mom...

i'm coming.

I wish.


[heavy breathing].

hi.

is she okay?

yeah, i think it was just

A bad dream.

did she wake up alicia?

nope.

Okay, as long as

We're not too noisy.

you know, it's funny.

Will sees me in all

Sorts of sexual situations.

He's even seen me give birth,

Twice...

But when it comes to

Talking about...

Talking about

What i really want,

I just can't do it.

guess what?

mm-hmm?

i've got a surprise for you.

oh, no.

Now what?

well...

Edible panties.

oh, man.

No, this is a wonderful...

No, it's a wonderful idea -->

come on.

 ...and we love it.

We really love it...

If you keep talking.

But now it's time to play

Go get your wife.

i just figured that if

You're in love,

You do, it's natural

And that's enough.

That's enough.

Music.

[heavy breathing].

do you feel good?

uh-huh.

it feels so good for me.



Does it feel good?

it feels so good.

honey?

you're perfect.

It's perfect.




and they said that men

Are just in it for sex.

Can we talk about

Anything, hon?

no.

Why?

i just figured there

Might be word about

Something or somebody.

no.

I'm happy for beth.

I think mike's a child

And i also think that

She deserves much better -->

okay, okay, okay, but

Okay, that's fine.

That's good.

Okay, mike has had a couple

Of problems he's working out.

yes, but why should beth

Have to suffer, alright?

I think it's great all the

Stuff she did on vacation.

I always knew she had

A wild streak in her.

hon, this isn't about

Her wild times and making

Measures, hmm?

now, i think my wild times

Are over for good.

Look, is there anything else

You need because i'd

Really like -->

no. That's fine.

Now watch tv, hon.

That's good.

are you okay?

yeah, just my stomach.

Must have been something

I ate.

Go back to sleep.

we're like -->

[indistinct chattering].

geez, i ask for three times.

I want some.

She gives all the guys one.


That was last week.

beth, give me some more-->

oh, tell me about

The survey thing that

You were telling me.

You know, the story you read.

all it mentioned was that

Sex takes up 1% of our lives.

that much time?

how much is 1% of

24 hours?

who says that it does?

it does.

it does not.

everybody knows that

The whole world

Revolves around sex.

fran, i'll tell you -->

we kill, die, suffer

And get divorced all for

A little nooky nooky.


oh, there she goes again.

Anytime anybody mentions sex,

There she goes.

that's not true.

well, i don't know about

The rest of you guys but -->

no big deal.

but i really

I don't think i would have

A problem with opening up

And telling my most intimate,

Filthy secrets to a total

Stranger for a survey

Like that, just to write in-->

oh, so some pervert can

Read them?

No, thanks.

i don't know.

Will, can perverts read?

i'll ask my boss.

you do.

i'm going to cry.


you know something fran?

Why don't you lighten

The fuck up?

I'm sorry, you know.

After all, what's a little

Sex among friends?


artie!

personally,

I call it an orgy.

alright...time out.

coffee, anyone?

tea, please.

get it yourself.

i'll take a coffee, fran.

same for me.

i'll get one.

[chattering distantly].


it's really starting

To show.

what is?

you can cut the tension

Between you two with

A feather cluster.

do you think eight scoops

Is enough for a full

Pot of coffee?

franny...

It's almost been a year.

Aren't you afraid artie will

Go looking for some girls?

look, that's not what this

Is about at all,

And artie would never.

don't be so sure

About that.

Put away a man

In his own bed,

There's no telling

What he'd do.

well, i guess it's up to me

To worry about that.

who are you to give

Advice, beth?

You gave up.

franny, aren't you afraid of

What artie will do?

look, i just don't want

To talk about this,

Not with you, not with him,

Not with anyone.

[dishes clanking].

Sex is always the answer,

Isn't it?

Reach up.

Emergency.

Emergency.

[indistinct chattering].

[ringing continues].

She sounds really young.

Just remember...

You don't live here anymore.

And im not your secretary.

hello?

maybe we could go

See hatchet.

That looks really good.


excuse me.

well, technically,

I'm still married.

The divorce hasn't

Gone through yet.

Leaving mike was the

Hardest thing i've ever done.

I can't imagine...

I can't imagine

Not being with him

That way anymore.

[car honking].

oh, that's shelley.

tell her i said hi.

mm-hmm.

I think i'm just gonna

Watch the game.

[dishes clanking].

Music.

I'm really sorry.

[slamming sound].

Hello?

hello.

Hello.

I was...

I was just...

Thinking about you

Touching yourself.

who is this?

who do you want it to be?

my knight in shining armor.

Pizza delivery.

Look, this is not the first

Phone call i've ever had

Like this.

what are you going to do

About this one?

i usually just hang up.

why don't you then?

i don't know.

There's just something

About your voice.

something?

something that sounds

As lonely as i feel.

Music.

what's your name?

meg.

that's pretty.

thanks.

What's yours?

it's artie and i hate it.

Meg, i know this sounds like-

Meg, i want you to touch

Yourself for me.

i don't think so.

i really want to make you

Feel good, meg.

no.

yes.

no.

yes.

why are you doing this?

i just need something.

I just need something.

look, i'm gonna hang up now.

Are you still there?

only if you want me to be.

do you like

Pleasing a woman?

i love pleasing a woman.

tell me what you'd

Do to me.

wait, this is franny, right?

[indistinct chattering].

it's too prim and proper.


we gotta find one

For you, franny.

wait a minute.

What's in here?

beth, what is this?

give me that.

do you actually wear

This stuff?

i like them.

men love them.

shelley -->

they don't stay on

That long.

look at that.

Good stuff.

that's my mask.

Don't make fun.

let's see what

Franny likes.


[indistinct chattering].

come on.

Look, look, look,

This is relatively tame.

Yes?

yeah.

or the green one?


oh no.

all day and so much money

Trying to spice you up, franny.

no, i don't think this one

Is for me.

it has built-in -->

check it out then. Come on!

yeah!

id like to see the look

On artie's face.

why are you so embarrassed

About your body?

i'm not.

It's...

Can i ask you guys

A question?

shoot.

What?

when you, you know,

Do you?

do you have any idea

What she's talking about?

none.

get that blouse.

what?

well, when you're

Having sex, do you come

Just from intercourse?

no, honey, no.

Usually it requires some

Sort of manual stimulation.

of course, franny.

I mean that's why

Men have fingers.

and toes.

and tongues.

good.

That was only one.

seriously, it's like

When god created women,

He made a mistake.

He put our clit

This much too far forward

And if he just moved it back

A little bit -->


stop!

seriously if he had -->

okay, okay.

it would be perfect.

can we try it?

yeah.

franny.

yeah.

go.

i am.

come on!

Hurry up because i'm going

To pick up the kids so -->

i can wait.

Let's go.

franny...

What do i do with you?

Let me see them.

Let me see your breasts,

Meg.

Touch them and tease

Your nipples for me.

Let me see them.

Do you like that?

yes, it feels good.

louder!

it feels great.

i want you to take your

Shirt off for me, meg.

Meg, i want you to take

Your panties off now.

Does it feel better?

yes.

does it feel good?

Rub it! Is it wet?

Does it feel good?

yes.

so tell me it

Feels good then.

it feels good.

It's wet.

Come for me!


Are you still

Among the living?

i think so.

That was -->

incredibly right?

I still have some work to do.


can i call you again, meg?

who am i kidding?

beth?

Beth?

Hey, i know this sounds crazy

But when i left, i...

I took your mask.

I'm sorry.

Richard, my friend shelley.

i didn't tell you to speak.

Stay, please.

I'm richard.

Stay.

I want you to stay and watch.

Please sit down.

It's okay.

it's like i want...

I want bone-jarring,

Window-rattling sex,

You know?

I just want passion.

And i want the lust

To be there.

And i don't think

That's wrong.

Music.

[indistinct chattering].

wow, 9.9!

Should go home now.

I do have a dress code.

Just give it a break.

We'll leave in a few minutes.

A few minutes?

Step for a man.

Like a beast.

[glasses clinking].

hi, i'm carol.

I haven't seen you

Here before.

It's my first name.

It's my first time.

My first -->


don't worry.

I'll be gentle.

[heavy breathing].

Music.

To do to you?

[heavy breathing].

i don't want to touch you.

yeah.

Is that how you like it?

kiss me!

Kiss me!

Kiss me!



let me kiss you.

Let me kiss you.


Yeah.



[breathing heavily].

i never thought you'd

Call back.

Why?

because i wanted you so bad.


why?

'cause you make me

Feel like-->

That's it.

You make me feel.

Where's your wife?

she is out

And we are alone.

franny's hurting.

I mean really hurting

And i know that but

I'm hurting too

And...

Meg takes my heart away.

Didn't you say something

About not wanting to

Feel anymore?

it's safer that way.

But life isn't safe now,

Is it?

I guess i'm just not very good

At putting up walls.

i'm in construction

And i'm real good

At breaking walls down.

artie?

i'm sorry i gotta go.


[dial tone beeping].

You have to answer

Some questions truthfully.

Then you have to take

The dare.

Franny, you're going first.

Don't cry.

Music.

I just...

Can't we just make love?

no, i can't.

It's not fun.

It's boring, will.

Why can't we talk

About this?

okay, "its boring...

It's boring, will".

And you lie there with

Your legs spread out

Right up to the

Ceiling tile...

Like a dead woman,

And i'm boring you.

Well, you too.

What's wrong with

A little love?

What's wrong with just

Doing it?

Why can't we just

Do it, hon?

meg, you are truly amazing.

What's your day

Like tomorrow?

who were you talking to?

hm?

Who were you talking to?

no one, baby.

It was the tv.

the tv?

It's cold.

yeah, so are you.

[crickets chirping].







oh, god.


Hold me.

Hold me.

Hold me.


[breathing heavily].

Oh, god.

I wasn't gonna stop.


you're so good

At being bad.

and you've got

An incredible teaser here.



i want you to do

Something for me.

so soon?

Geez, let me catch

My breath first, okay?


i don't want you to

Make love to him anymore.

Music.

If you're serious about this,

Then you'll stop.


[vibrating sound].

[dogs barking distantly].

Music.

[breathing heavily].

Disco music.

[indistinct chattering].

[cheering and applause].

hi.

hi.

enjoyed the show?


you hungry?

sure.

That's beyond early,

I have class tomorrow.


you are going to kill me.

look who's talking.

So where is she tonight?

out... With the girls.

[crickets chirping].

she'll do anything to

Avoid being alone with you,

Won't she?

you noticed that too, huh?

sorry.

That's none of my business.

nope.

You happen to be

Very right, meg.

look, artie, if we ever

Get together, there'll

Be nothing left.


meg, i really think

We should meet.

it would never work.

why?

you know why.

I mean for christ's sake,

We met through a fucking

Obscene phone call.

That's not exactly

A foundation for

A meaningful relationship.

meg, we already like

Each other.

what if we weren't

Physically attracted

To each other?

that's not gonna happen.

what if it did?

what are you so

Afraid of, meg?

im afraid of...

I'm afraid of

Getting hurt.

It happens to me

All the time.

Things just seem

To miraculously work out

With the wife

And i end up alone,

Just when you're tired of

Being alone.

[ball bouncing].

on top of everything else,

Shelley is never having

Sex with me anymore.

yeah.

Well, take my word for it.

If you have an affair,

You're going to regret it

10 seconds after you come.

Marriage vows,

All those promises,

You'll know that you've

Stepped all over them.

Youll feel like a liar

And a piece of shit and

Nothing you can ever do

Or say will change

What you did.

yeah, well, you should

Think about that yourself

Too, okay?

you know how fucking

Frustrating it is?

Beth and i, we tried it.

In fact, i want her back.

I still love her.

Man, i hate this

Fucking game.

[birds singing].

meg?

artie?

bill.


[children talking distantly].

hi.

hi.

you wanna go somewhere?

Cup of coffee or something?

i never touch the stuff.

Tea, lemon and one sugar.

I got my truck over here.

I thought maybe we could

Sit and talk.

face to face for a change.

I'd like that.

me too.

[door opens].

beth?

[door closes].

don't you know how to knock?

Oh mike, i don't know

What to say.

just say thanks.

did you get this out of

My garden?

so what did you want

To see me about?

why couldn't you have

Been this nice when

We were married?

oh, we're still

Married, kiddo.

What is this?

[paper rustling].

No, beth.

I'm not gonna sign them.

mike, you must have known

It was coming.


so...

well, well, well.

Three holes in the ground.


I can't believe you

Know that.

That's amazing.

do i look like you

Imagined i would?

no.

Better.

So much better, meg.

What about me?

i tried not to

Picture anything.

That way i wouldn't be

Disappointed.


are you?

no.

Oh, this is so awkward.

I know what you sound

Like coming.

I don't even know what

Your favorite color is.

white.

great to know.

Mine is blue.

I've been so incredibly

Busy lately.

Writing reports mostly.

I think writing is probably

The loneliest thing

In the world.


hello, meg.

Music.

[breathing heavily].

meg, no.

i want to.

Let me touch you.

this is for you.

This is for you.

It's all for you.


Open your eyes, meg.

I want to see them.


I want to see you, meg.

I want to see you.

I want to see you.

I want to see you, meg.

I want to see you.




i can't believe how soon

I can do that.

oh god, no.

No, no, no.

God!

You look so beautiful.

You get all shiny

Like a pony.


shouldn't you be home

With your wife?

yeah, well,

Both the little ones

Are in bed and shelley

Is probably off watching

"the love connection"

Right about now.

okay, come on.


fear of age.

No, it's more than that.

I've had chance

To fool around.

It's wrong.

You gotta consider the kids.

It's not fair to them.

I've got two of them.

My father walked out on me

When i was still in

Grade school

And i vowed never to let

That happen to my kids.

Anyway, you get married

And you make promises

To each other, vows.

Sometimes when a person

Doesn't live up to

Their end of the bargain

And you end it,

I guess, i mean,

If you can't fix it...

I'm not trying to fix it.

Sometimes i think it's

Just beyond repair.

what are you doing?

you said i could.

no.

What i say and what

I choose to do are two

Different things.

No.

richard, i want you.

Come on.

I've been a good girl.

i'll be the judge of that.

ow.

Ow, that hurts.

it's supposed to hurt.

Hey, did i say you can

Kiss me?

kiss you?

I'm trying to bite you.

Please, richard,

I want you so bad.

how bad?

is tea okay?

[water pouring].

thanks.

See, this is the way

I love you, just-->

you love me, huh?

i mean...


i know what you mean.

Some music?


slow dancing?

slow music?

Music.


i've never been

Unfaithful to my wife.

i know it.

It shows.


Well...

Maybe you should go home.

yeah.

Thanks for the tea.

sure.

there she is.

hi.

hi.

Ooh, food!

Ooh, ooh.

lunch.

oh, i'm hungry.

I'm hungry.

What do we got?

here we go.

ah.

and a soy sauce here.

great.

tea with lemon.

One sugar.

i can't believe you

Remember that.

Thank you.

Thank you.

well, i tell you,

If you tell me something

hm-hmm?

and you like it,

hm-hmm?

ill make it a point

To remember it..

that's good.

I like that.

doesn't she?

no, she...

She stopped caring.

you want chopsticks?

chopsticks.

did i mention that

I am a great cook?

yeah, you own

A chinese restaurant?


god, id love to cook

For you.

I would love to wake up

Next to you and-->

meg, i think we maybe

Should-->

you know, artie!

I wouldn't have to

Fuck you, okay?

Just hold you.

All night.

how was...

Where the hell

Were you last week?

seattle.

how was seattle?

it was very wet.

So am i.

[paper rustling].

Why is it you never

Let me kiss you

Or touch you?

i'm afraid if we...

I'm afraid if i...

I'm afraid you might

Disappear.

so, what are we exactly?

I mean we're not lovers.

friends, i guess,

Very good friends.

friends do not do

What we do.

Why don't you stop trying

To make this less than

What it is?

just what is that, meg?

i dont know.

damned if we know.

Damned if we don't know.

Music.

[keys jingling].

[glass breaks].

shit!

Gotta love it.

[water running].

oh, mike!

let me see your face.

you scared me.

Get out!

let me see your face.

mike, we shouldn't

Be doing this.

come on.

You're just so beautiful.

mike, no.

This is wrong.

You got to stop this.


i remember the time when...

Getting married

And spending the rest

Of our lives together was

The greatest thought

In the whole world.

And now...

Getting a divorce is...

Is the only way we can

Stay friends.

[water running].

mike, do you hear me?

i heard you.

Beth...

won't you sign the papers?

how can you say that

After what just happened?

Come on.

Maybe we're making

A mistake.

mike, you don't get it,

Do you?

You said we are not

Getting back together.

It's just sex,

Not a relationship.

[door slams].

is she out again?

no, she's asleep.

I checked in on her

Right before i called.

hello?

Who were you talking to?

please don't take it so hard.

what, am i supposed to be

Happy about this?

i don't expect you to be.

I tried to warn you.

Even beth did.

oh, so you're still

Seeing beth.

That's it.

i never stay in anyones

Place for a long time.

It just has to be this way.

am i just some kind of toy?

Is that what it is?

Just some kind of little

Fucking game that you play?

no.

then tell me.

What is it?

Just tell me what it is.

I will change.

it's not-->

richard-->

no.

It's not you, shelley.

It's something in me

And i can't change.

I don't want to change.

so that's it.

Just walk away?

It's easier just to

Pick me up,

Throw me on the ground,

Squash me and walk

The fuck away, isn't it?

that's your version.

fuck you!

It's your version.

Fuck you, richard.

Fuck you!

How dare you,

Fucking asshole!


you're awake, fran.

I know you're awake.

You're always awake, fran.

do you have a girlfriend?

do i have a wife?

are you seeing somebody?

do you want to talk

About this?

I mean do you really want

To talk about this?

yes.

Artie, i just can't be

Who you want me to be.

I just can't go where you

Want me to go.

Not right now anyway!

fran, listen,

You've got to let go.

i can't!

you have to forget, fran!

You got to forget.

It's killing us, okay?

i'm your husband.

I'm your husband.

You're my wife.

i'm sorry but i can't!

I can't!

No!

So you tell me what

You want to do now.

You just tell me

Right now, and i mean now.

Music.

i just need time, artie.

fuck the time!

Fuck it!

There ain't anymore

Time, fran.

Do you want to just...

Do you just not want

To feel anymore at all?

Is that it?

sometimes.

bullshit, fran.

Bullshit!

It's most times and

I feel...

I feel very sorry for you,

Fran, very sorry.


i feel...

Like i'm being punished.

Artie really wanted

To make love and i felt

So beautiful being pregnant,

So we made love

And there was blood

And we lost the baby.

All i really wanted to be

Was somebody's mother,

Somebody's wife

And somebody's mother.

Music.


i'm so sorry.


okay.

It's okay.

Its okay.

i'm going to dallas.

dallas cowgirl.

When would you get back?

i mean i'm moving now.

oh, jesus christ!

Oh, jesus christ!

I knew it.

I told you,

You would disappear.

look, i was-->

you son of a bitch, meg!

You son of a bitch,

You're running away.

You get what you

Fucking want,

You fucked me and

You're running away now?

let's get one thing straight.

What we just did here

Was not fucking, okay?

I was planning to move

To dallas before i even

Met you,

Before you even called me.

Why do you think i went

To dallas so often?

meg, really?

Then why didn't

You tell me before, huh?

Why didnt you

Tell me before?

never once did you say

To me you'd leave her.

Never once did you tell me

You loved me.

I am so sick and tired

Of being the other woman.

I am so sick and tired

Of guys telling me,

"she's doesn't

Fuck me like you.

She doesn't suck me

Like you."

I just need something

That's mine.

i'm yours.

I'm yours, meg,

And you know it.

I'm more yours than...

I'm more yours than i am hers.

she is your wife.

I am so sick of

Having nothing.

Music.

meg, please...

Don't punish me

For every guy that's

Fucked you over.

It's not fair to me.

does this seem easy for me?

I just can't

Do it anymore.

alright then...

Then i'm going with you.

For good.

I'll meet you tomorrow

Morning at 10:30.

At the swing.

You bring the tea.

okay.

Music.


what do you want me

To do, huh?

Do you want me to

Move out like liberated

Beth and mike, huh?

Or maybe we should just

Barely tolerate each other

Like good old fucking

Dependable shelley and will?

Is that what you want, huh?

i dont know.


that's right, fran.

You don't know?

You don't know?

How many times did i

Tell you how unhappy i was?

You fucking blame me

How many times?

How many times did i

Reach out to you and

You pushed me away?

I did not kill our baby!


You did not kill our baby.

It just happened.

It didn't have to kill us.


yes, i'd like to confirm

One first class seat

On flight 454 to dallas.

The name is

Pamela lindgren,

L-i-n-d-g-r-e-n.

Thank you!

Music.
