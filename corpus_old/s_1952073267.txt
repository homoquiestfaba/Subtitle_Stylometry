(rain falling)

(siren wailing in distance)

(thunder crashing)

(thunder crashes)

Thank you.


How long she
gonna be there?

Well, the wife's mother,

she's taking longer
to die than we thought.

You said she never liked you.

No. I said

she thought I was
the wrong guy.

Boy, that's good coffee.

Maybe not <i>quite</i> as good

as a macchiato after
carbonara at Adriano's.

But, uh, certainly good coffee
for fast-food coffee.

What's the name
of this place again?

Franco's.

Franco's.

I didn't think
the State Homicide Commander

did stakeouts.
It's not a stakeout.

It feels like
a stakeout.

No, I just want to see
how long this guy's

gonna stay in there.

Because...?
Because

I didn't think he'd
stay in there this long.

Franco's had pizza--
should I go back?

I told you we had
to make a stop.

You did.

We'll have dinner at Adriano's.

Tonight?

Tonight.

Okay?


(gunshots ricocheting)

(last gunshot echoes)

(windshield wipers
whooshing rhythmically)

(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

We've managed to stabilize him.

If he makes it, we'll
have to open him up again

when he's stronger.

That's all we know.


You're a member of Mr. Healy's
immediate family?

It's <i>Captain</i> Healy,

and no, I'm not, and
his wife is in Seattle.

Someone has to sign
for his valuables--

his badge, his gun.

I'll take them.
You a fellow officer?

Yes.

Can I see your badge?

It's in a drawer.

You were with him?

Yes.

That his blood on you?

Some of it.

I'll get them.

(seabirds crying)

(door opens)

Morning.

She's interviewing

the candidate, Lou.

I'm Jesse.

I know.

You keep calling me Lou,
Suitcase,

I'm going to call you Luther.

Why would I call you Lou, Jesse?

Sorry I'm late.

Chief Stone,
William Butler.

Nice to meet you.

Oh, Rose, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

Yeah, we were up

to the Boston PD,
which you left in...

Uh, May 2002.

At which point I
moved to Springfield

and joined
the force there.

I was the CJIS, uh, liaison
to the staties.

What is CJIS liaison
to the staties?

Criminal Justice
Information Services.

Computers?

Yes, but I want to get back
to hands-on policing.

Well, we're hands-on here.

I guess that's all,

unless you have
anything, Jesse.

I do.

Did you leave your last two
jobs, or were you let go?

I beg your pardon?

You didn't hear me?

I heard you.

I left.

Thank you very much,

Mr. Butler.
It was a pleasure.

We'll let
you know.

Where were you?

I got stuck
in traffic.

From your house?

No, from Boston.

What did you think?

Well, he has a very
impressive résumé.

I don't like him.
Why not?

He's overqualified.

Well, so were you.

SUIT: Jesse, Carter Hansen
wants to see you

over at City Hall.

Did he say why?
No.

My sense is that it's urgent.

HANSEN: Any comment?

They misspelled "Healy."

Well, they got
<i>your</i> name right.

Another shooting
incident.

What were <i>you</i>
doing there?

Talking to a friend.

Did this stakeout

have anything to do
with Paradise?

It wasn't a stakeout.
Did it have

anything to do with this town?

No.

You were
moonlighting.

Actually, I was drinking coffee.

When the town council
hired you,

we made it clear

that the Paradise
chief of police

does not have
a 9:00 to 5:00 job.

I know that.

And with the departure
of Officer DeAngelo,

it's more important
than ever

for you
to be here.

To show the flag, so to speak.

So, um...

how did the interview go
this morning?

What interview?

Candidate seems
highly qualified.

I don't think
hiring your son-in-law

is a good idea.
Strike that.

For the record, Paradise
promotes tourism, not crime.

Crime is bad
for business,

and some
of your exploits

garner headlines
that we don't need

and we don't appreciate.

I see it as my job
not to look the other way.

Well, I've called a meeting
of the full council

for 10:00 tomorrow morning.

Good for you.

We can fire you.

You can.

But you can't tell me
what to do.

(speaking faintly, indistinctly)

Mrs. Healy called.

She just got back.

She said, "Thanks
for saving his life."

She told me
what happened.

Why didn't you?

Old habit.

Who's that?

I don't know.

No one tells me anything
around here.

ROSE: Jesse.

Why don't you come in, Suit?

Can I?

You can.

ROSE: Jesse, this is
Elizabeth Blue.

Her baby was kidnapped
a few years ago.

She thinks he might
be in Paradise.

Where was the baby
kidnapped?

ROSE: Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Little Boy Blue.

It was all over

the news.

That was quite a while ago,
wasn't it?

December 28, 2000.

Seven years.

Wasn't the body recovered?

You know this case?

Know of.

That wasn't my baby.

I thought
the body

was identified.

My husband...

A baby's body was found
in a dry riverbed

near the
Mexican border.

It had the
hospital

wristband on it.

But it was...

Decomposed?

My husband
had the remains buried.

He didn't think that I
was strong enough to see it.

ROSE: And you think your son

is alive and here
in Paradise.

I know it.

You got a feeling.

ROSE: Why do you think

he's here, Elizabeth?

I received an anonymous letter.

It said...

"Your child is loved."

ROSE: And it was postmarked Paradise?

JESSE: Did you get

any other letters?

Yes.

From other places?

Yes.

How many?

Hundreds.

SUIT: So, why Paradise?

Because this one

haunts me.

"Your child is loved."

I just want my son back.

Mrs. Blue, anybody
could have written that letter.

You're looking

at the entire
Paradise police force.

A letter
like that...

I don't think there's anything
we can do to help you.

I'm sorry.


I have to
get back

to Boston in the morning.

I have to be in Albuquerque
for work,

and I can't miss my bus.


(firing stops)

If you have to use that,
you're going to have problems.

Safety's on the wrong side.
Safety's on the wrong side.

You could install an
ambidextrous safety.

I don't like them.

They break too easily.

Too much torque.

You're doing a
lot better, Rose.

That one would
have definitely

ruined someone's
evening.

ROSE: When were you
planning on

telling me you were shot?

Clearly I didn't need to.

Why do I get the feeling
that's only one shoe?

You're not even gonna try
to look for that woman's baby?

This is a small town;
how hard can it be?

That kidnapping
was all over the news, Rose.

This is a small town.

Exactly.

SUIT: Someone would have noticed

a new baby
without a pregnancy, Rose.

Maybe they didn't move here
until later.

Just so they could send
an incriminating letter?

Who's "they"
and how do you find them?

I don't know.

What do you think, Suit?

What do I think
or what do I feel, Lou?

Either one.

I feel the baby's dead.

(frogs croaking,
insects chittering)

# #

(sighs softly)

ROSE: Jesse, where are you?

He's been sitting here
for half an hour.

I guess I'll start
the interview without you.

You need to get a cell phone.

(click, beep)

JENN: Jesse.

It's Jenn.

I...

(phone ringing)

I need you to call me tonight.

It's about Elliot.

I was hoping to talk to you.

I...

Hello.

JENN: Hello, Jesse.

Hello, Jenn.

How are you?

Fine.

Are you alone?

No. I'm talking with you, Jenn.

Are you drinking?

I'm having my first
of two scotches.

Jesse, why do you drink
when you're alone?

You sound like
your psychiatrist.

He's your psychiatrist, Jesse.

Okay.

Jesse, I still care about you.

It's about Elliot.

He wants me to move in with him.

Okay.

How do you feel about that?

How do I feel about that?

It would be unethical.

What are you talking about?

A Hollywood weather girl
living with her producer.


(sighs softly)

(receiver rattles)

What are you looking at?

(thunder rumbles softly)

# #

So you know who the shooter was?

JESSE: Healy couldn't say.

Is he gonna make it?

I don't know.
I'm going in this morning.

Did you hit the guy?

I would say yes,

with my second shot.

It's got to have
something to do with

who he was staking out.

Did he tell you who?

He got evasive.

You know.

You were a cop.

Which means it has
something to do

with who he was
staking out.

Jenn's moving in
with her producer.

Elliot?

The guy who had sex

with my wife two days after

our "let's get acquainted
with my new boss" dinner.

So how do you feel about that?

How do I feel about that?

I don't know.

Maybe you should ask Suitcase.

He didn't make Jenn do it,
did he?

He's on my list.

What list is that?

Jenn called you
before I started here.

Yeah, she did.

What'd she tell you?

I can't tell you that.

What can you tell me?

I can tell you that

two drinks alone at night
is a lousy rule.

It's not a rule.

Exactly.

So did you go in the tank
after she called?

Almost.

So you called me.
Yeah.

Why?

Because I really like you.

Why don't you kiss my ass?


Every time we start
to figure something out,

you make some wise-ass remark
or you take a hike on me.


Who kidnaps babies?

What?

I want to know
who kidnaps babies.

It's my time.

I pay you 165 bucks an hour.

180 bucks an hour.

Is this something
we're investigating?

No.

In the old days, it was people
who couldn't have babies

or had lost a baby.

Nowadays,
it's a service industry.

People steal babies
to sell them.

Or their parts.

Why so early?

I got a town council meeting.

They're on your ass.

Small town.

Police department down to three.

Well...

two and one with
his hand tied

behind his back.

Suit's on light ad.

Actually, it's one
and two people with

one hand tied behind their back.

You're up to your shorts
in an attempted murder or murder

of a police officer.

Two police officers.

You fired your weapon;
you're gonna need

a good lawyer.
It's just Internal Affairs.

Exactly. You're gonna need
a good lawyer.

Did you get shot in the arm?

Yes.

Did they give
you a sling?

Yes.

So you're choosing
not to help yourself get better.

I sense a parable.

(woman talking quietly)

(door opens)

Come on in, Jesse.

PERKINS: This is great.

Excuse me?

This is my first non-
fatal bullet wound.

You're lucky.

No bone, just
soft tissue.

Looks like they did a good job.

No infection.

Stitches have pulled
a little bit.

Should be okay if
you're careful.

Shouldn't you have a sling?

They said I didn't need one.

Pediatricians don't
deliver babies.

No, we attend
the birth.

How hard is it to access
birth records, Doc?

Big city, you'd need some sort
of court order, but here...

Why?

No reason.

I see you got
new business cards.

"Peter Perkins.

Pediatrician/Medical Examiner."

I'm proud to be

your medical examiner.

But you keep them
in a little plastic hippo.

What can I say?

You made me a hyphenate.

I'm proud of being
a pediatrician, too.

Sorry.

I was fighting crime.

Chief Stone,
losing Officer DeAngelo

was a serious blow

to the Paradise
Police Department.

Yeah, in the last month,
Officer Gammon wrote 47 tickets,

Officer DeAngelo
wrote 174 tickets,

Officer Simpson was
on light administrative duties,

and you wrote six.

I'm the police chief.

DeAngelo was the Babe Ruth
of parking tickets.

And you drove him out.

I may have.

Why?

I didn't like him.

So, uh, how's
Officer Simpson doing?

I'd like to release him
from light ad.

No adverse effects
from the coma?

None.

We'll take it
under consideration.

Who's manning
the entrance to town?

The speed trap?
Now, strike that.

No one.

Why not?

I don't think it's ethical.

Brings in a lot of revenue.

You like movies, Chief Stone?

Good ones.

Yeah.

Well, we think
you police this town

like a cowboy sheriff
in a bad movie.

We think?

I think you're making up
your own rules.

Like Little Bill Daggett.

Excuse me?

Gene Hackman in <i>Unforgiven.</i>

I would
prefer that

you think of me as
a benevolent Gene Hackman.

Boy, that was a good movie.

Well, cinema commentary
aside, Morris...

Get this, Chief Stone.

We know we can't fire you

without notice,
but we do have other options.

You could be suspended.

We could dock your pay.

But whatever we choose to do,
consider yourself warned.

(school bell ringing)

(kids shouting playfully)

JESSE: It's hard to move on.

I had a few questions.

You changed your mind?

No, I didn't.

You said you got a letter.

This the original
envelope?

Yes, Chief Stone.

Jesse.

Jesse.

Why would somebody write you
five years later?

As you know,
the press had a field day

with my baby's
kidnapping.

"Little Boy Blue" was

just too good a headline.

I think the story
finally disappeared

when a pop singer went into
rehab for the 14th time.

A cable station did
a fifth-anniversary show.

And they asked me
about my son.

And you said you had a feeling
your son was still alive.

I still do.

And that started the letters?

That inspired that letter.

Why'd you wait so long
after receiving it?

My husband kept it from me.

He didn't think I should see it.

How did you feel about that?

I left him.

Because of this letter?

Our marriage had deteriorated
to such a point that...

Basically, yes.

(girl laughing nearby)

MAN (over P.A.): Bus number 24
westbound service to Philadelphia,

Knoxville, Little Rock,
Albuquerque...

I have to go back to work.

Now boarding at platform A-C.

Send me everything you have
overnight.

You'll find my son?

I didn't say that.

His name is Adam.

Eileen?
(monitor beeping)

I don't know, Eileen.

Captain Healy,
everything's okay.

Eileen?

You're gonna be
feeling some gas,

it's okay to release it.

I'll stay anyway.

Press that
if anything happens.

(distant phone ringing)

Eileen?

Could I have some...

some ice?

How close was I?

You were definitely
circling the drain.

So who do you think
shot you?

I didn't see the shooter.

Did you?

I think I shot him.

Did you know him?

Not in silhouette.

I ran everybody in
the building.

No priors.

Who were you staking out?

Oh... don't get into that.

I have to.
Why?

Because he shot me, too.

Come here.

I was keeping

an eye on my nephew.

Okay.

My sister thinks

he's having an affair
with his saxophone

teacher.

Okay.

He's 18, she's 35.

So, was he?

Hmm.

So, tell me...

Did you ever have an affair
with an older woman?

Yes.

You?

Yes.

Bear any psychological scars?

No.

Just fond memories.

Uh-huh.

So who do you think shot you?

I haven't a clue.

Okay.

(mechanical whirring)

(dial tone)

This is Jim Kennedy, the
governor's chief of staff.

The governor was just visiting
the state homicide commander

who's recovering from his second
surgery in two days,

and we seem to be missing
something here.

We're missing 24-hour
police protection.

Do it.

(footsteps approaching)

Where were you?

Out drinking all night.

Give me a straight answer,
you son of a bitch.

Healy's going to live.

I'm sorry, Jesse.

If he survives the gas.

You are a son of a bitch.

I want to find Little Boy Blue.

Well, if you find him,

see if he took a shot at Healy.
Somebody wrote

that letter;
they know where he is.

The baby is in his grave.

And if he's not,
he could be anyplace.

The letter tells us nothing.

It said, "Your child is loved."

Is loved.
As in:

God loves all children.

Or as in: the writer is crazy.

Jesse, she came
all this way

on hope.

2,000 miles on a bus.

Don't you think we owe her?

What if he lived here
and moved away?

What if he never lived here
but just stopped by

to mail the letter?

What if some vacationing tourist

decided to send
an encouraging note?

Jesse, I know I'm not
an experienced

cop like you,
but what are we

doing here if we won't look
for a little lost boy?

You can only do what you can do.

But he might
be here!

She needs to know

that somebody did
absolutely

everything they could
to find him.

I can't justify opening up
a seven-year-old,

out-of-state kidnapping.

We have to try!

I won't.

Paradise is my last stop, Rose.

There's nowhere to go
from here.

Then I'm going to do it.

On my own time.

I can't stop you.

Yes, you can.

But I won't.

Good.

What are you thinking?

I was thinking,
if I ever get kidnapped,

I hope you're on the case.

(distant siren wailing)


Could the shooter have
been after you?

No.
Because?

Why go after me
from the driver's side?

Did you discharge your weapon?
I did.

How many discharges?

Two.

Any shooting incidents
in LA Homicide?

Yes.
How many?

One.
Fatality?

Are you asking me
or reading about it?

Chief Stone, you have been
police chief of Paradise

for almost three years.

That's correct.

How many shooting incidents?

Six.

Four.

Twice, the sentence was carried
out for me.

"The sentence," now that's an
interesting take on police work.

Four.

Fatalities?

Four.

A rather conspicuous use
of deadly force.

Why use deadly force
if it isn't deadly?

Chief Stone, you are aware...

That, as a good guy,

I'm responsible for every round

from the moment it leaves
the barrel

until it reaches its
final resting place.

You said you think you may
have hit the assailant

with one shot?
That's correct.

Where did the other one go,
Chief Stone?

Jesse.

Where did the other one go,
Chief Stone?

Into a brick wall.

How long have you been
in Internal Affairs?

Almost three years.

Ever been in the field,
Officer Greenstreet?

Sidney.

You ever been in the field,
Sidney?

I have, Jesse.

You ever shot anybody, Sidney?

I have.

It's...

Disturbing.

Are you married, Sidney?

Divorced.

As are you.

Jesse.

Jesse.

MAN: Keep 'em up.

To the body,
to the body.

Hello.

And you are?

You don't remember me?

I remember the hat.

PPD.

Paradise.

I'd like to speak to Mr. Fish.

Mr. Fish is not in.

Alan.

You remember me!
Alan...

he's right over there.

Mr. Fish is not in.

If Mr. Fish were in, I
think I'd know about it.

Jesse Stone.

Mr. Fish is in.

I had nothing to do with
shooting Captain Healy.

Actually, I was hoping

you could help me acquire some
methamphetamines.

I read about it
in the paper.

Shooting cops is bad
for business.

Exactly.

You hear things.

Oh, I hear lots of things.

Why would I tell you?

Because you really like me.

I didn't shoot anyone.
I know.

So why do you
come to me?

You're the only mobster I know.

You knew my friend Leo Finn.

And you killed him.

Actually, his bodyguard
killed him.

Lovey Norris

was trying to shoot you.

How do you know?

Assumption.

Good assumption.

Suffice it to
say, but for

your exasperating directness,

my friend would still be alive.

He wasn't your friend.

Colleague.

We went to the same church.

You were choir boys together?

I didn't say that.

So you won't help me.

No.

You could keep your eyes
and ears open.

I always do.

It was nice to see
you, Jesse Stone.

(trainer speaking
indistinctly)

Come on, come on.

How's the crime scene
at Paradise Doughnuts.

Under constant surveillance.

I feel doughnuts certify
one's copness.

No coffee?

My body's
a temple.

Want one?

My body's a temple.

You just getting back
from Boston?

How do you know
I was in Boston?

Information's out there;

all you have to do is let it in.

So who shot Healy?

I have no idea.

My sense is it had something

to do with the stakeout.
It had

nothing to do
with the stakeout.

So you think.

So Healy knows.

Oh.

He was monitoring
a saxophone lesson,

which leaves
me nowhere.

Stir the pot.

We going after this?

I'm going after this.

You still seeing
Cissy Hathaway?

What do you mean?

Well, she's older...

How'd you know?

The information's out there.

All you have to do is let it in.

You feel damaged
in any way?

No.

Cissy teach you anything?

A lot.

Well, there you go.

How'd the town
council meeting go?

You pick a fight?

No.

Maybe we should start
manning the speed trap.

I don't like the speed trap.

I know, the speed
trap isn't ethical.

Speeding is
speeding, Jesse.

It's the law.

The speed limit changes
and nobody can see the sign.

Exactly.

You want to man it, man it.

(thunder rumbling, rain falling)

Getting shot didn't
slow you down.

How do you know?

Guess we'll have to wait till
you're healed and try again.

I like the
word "again."

So, Sidney...

Did your wife remarry, Jesse?

No, Sidney.

Now that we've had sex,

do you think we could stop with
the whole first name ping-pong?

Of course, Sidney.

I just like saying it.

Who was Healy staking out?

You're interrogating
me in your underwear.

I'm asking you
a question.

It wasn't
a stakeout.

My husband just told me
his new wife is having a baby.

My wife--

ex-wife-- just moved in
with her boyfriend.

So we're both feeling kind of
disposable and in desperate need

of consolation and would be
inclined to turn a casual something

into more than it was.

On the other hand, there's
nothing wrong with consolation

So you think we
should be careful.

I think we should...

carefully do this again.

Pals who have sex.

I've heard it described as that.

I like you,
Sidney.

You're the first person I've
met on the entire East Coast

who's more afraid of
commitment than I am.

Ever had sex
with a younger man, Sidney?

Why do you ask?

I'm conducting a survey.

Nothing to say
to each other afterwards,

but the young man had
a hell of a ride.

I'll let myself out.

Don't get up.

I prefer to think of you
lying there in your afterglow.

# #

(reporters clamoring)

(camera shutters snapping)

Overwhelming evidence points
in the other direction,

<i>but there is no doubt in my mind</i>

<i>that that baby was switched
for Adam.</i>

MAN: <i>Do you have any proof?</i>

ELIZABETH: <i>I just know.</i>

(rain patters in distance)

# #

(alarm beeping)

(beeping stops)

(birds chirping)

(birds chirping)


(chain saw revving)

(footsteps approaching)

You're early.

You're earlier.

You have a phone message
on your desk.

Who was it?

He wouldn't say.

I've been up all night;
I couldn't sleep.

How do I do it, Jesse?
I use scotch.

How do I find Adam?

What have you got?
I don't have anything.

We always have something.
We?

Figure of speech.

Just start at the beginning.

December 28, 2000,

Adam Blue is born.

The next day
he disappears

from his hospital
bed in Albuquerque.

Remains with
his wrist ID

end up near the Mexican border
six months later.

The authorities assume

the kidnappers escaped
across the border.

Well, they wanted

a closed case,
Feds'll do that.

You know... that river runs
from Albuquerque

right down
to where the body was found.

How do you know that?

I played Triple-A ball
in Albuquerque.

Anyway, it all but dries up
in the summer.

They find a body snagged
on a branch,

but it could have been dumped
in Mesita or anywhere upstream.

Is Mesita
where the body was found?

It's a little town-- 923 people.

No medical examiner,
no tests,

no ID except for the father.

How do you know this?

What's this?

Some stuff.

Where'd you get it?

Mailman.

It's from Albuquerque.

When did you talk
to the mother?

You believe the boy's alive.

No,

I don't, but I do believe

Elizabeth deserves
a decent investigation.

She sure hasn't gotten one
so far.

She needs
to move on.

The only thing
that'll let her is certainty.

So you're going to help me?

No.

Well, it seems to me
we could find

a seven-year-old boy
a lot quicker

if we were working
on this together.

Well, what do you need me for?
You've just narrowed it down

by age and gender.
What else do you know?

There are 40,000 seven-year-old
boys in this state.

And how many
in Essex County?

5,000.
And how many in Paradise?

About 67.

Well, just find out
where they were born.

You know,
you keep this up,

you'll make detective
someday.

We don't have detectives.

No, but if we did...

Be careful with that.

What is it?
A letter.

Mmm.

Thank you for not wearing

your stupid hat.

The hat in and of
itself is not stupid.

Because?

Because I designed it.

Ah. Would you excuse us
for a moment, Alan?

(snaps fingers)

Please.

There, uh,
there might be

somebody...

who works for somebody.

Would the somebody
who works for somebody

be involved in prostitution?

Mm-hmm.

Teenage prostitution.

I've heard you have scruples
about that.

Where on earth would you get
such an idea?

From Captain Healy,

our gravely-wounded friend.

He's not a friend.

This...

somebody... might hold a grudge.


Do you have a name?

Oh, you do your job,
you'll figure it out.

Everybody says that.

You a Red Sox fan, Gino?

When they're winning.

Well, you know, the hardest
thing to hit is a triple.

With your scruples

about prostitution,
you give up drugs

and gambling...

that would be a triple.

You can leave now, Jesse Stone.

(indistinct chatter)

(indistinct conversation)

Talk to me.

Sister Mary John.

Jesse Stone.

You're a long way from Paradise.

Why would you
remember me?

You caught the killer
of one of my girls.

You're in my good book.

You have a bad book?
Oh, yeah.

I'm looking for
someone in there.

You want a coffee?

I would never turn down
such an offer, Sister.

<i>In my line of work,</i>

I find it best to
be totally honest.

I remembered you

because I saw your
name in the paper.

I'm hurt.

This is about
the shooting?

It is.

Whoever did it was involved
in teenage prostitution.

How do you know?

I can't tell you.

My girls aren't
always prostitutes.

I know that.

I think you're a good guesser.

And you need a good guesser?

I do.

I'm looking for someone capable
of conduct without conscience.

And who runs a string of pimps?

That's correct.
Bixy Chapelle.

Bixy Chapelle is the boss.

I'm looking for a guy
who works for him.

Somebody who
likes to get even.

Pauly Palmieri,

Teddy Leaf,

Winston Monroe.

How do you know?

They're on my list.

They've all had
girls disappear.


Thank you.

I know you're a nun, but maybe
we could have dinner sometime.

I'd like that.

I know you won't give him up,

but maybe you could
tell me who it isn't.

Pauly Palmieri, Teddy Leaf,

Winston Monroe.

One and three.

MAN: Hey, brother, you got
any spare change?

No, do you?

How many quarters you got?

Six.

I'll give you five
bucks for them.

You're welcome.

ROSE: <i>Jesse, where are you?</i>

I paged you.

That was you?
That was me.

Councilman Comden dropped by.

Oh, he's okay.

How do you know?

He likes movies.

Listen, is Suitcase there?

No, he's out manning
the speed trap.

Showing the flag.

How's he doing?

Well, he called me on his

cell phone and said he hasn't

written a single ticket.

Does he know why?

No.

Well, don't tell him.
Don't tell him what?

Never mind.

I took Doc Perkins
the names of all

the seven-year-old boys
in the Paradise school system,

and he was at the birth
of every one of them.

Small town.

He said you brought
the subject up.

Hey, what about the
home-schooled kids?

Well, how would you find them?

I guess I'd have to talk
to the school board.

Yeah, their parents

would need a permit.

Carter Hansen's wife

is chairman of the school board.

Do you want him to know
that we're investigating

a seven-year-old
out-of-state kidnapping?

You're investigating
a seven-year-old

out-of-state kidnapping.

You'll find a way, Rose.

(hangs up)

(saxophone playing slow tune)

(stops playing)

(Healy sighs)

Eileen thought
I was looking

a little peaked.

So, I'm taking some sun.

I'm like a character
in <i>Little Women.</i>

Oh, this is

my nephew, Michael.

Michael... he's on his way
to a saxophone lesson.

Pleased to
meet you, sir.

Jesse. You enjoying your
saxophone lessons, Michael?

I'm learning a lot.

I'll bet you are.

And he's getting

better and better.

You must have a good teacher.

Um, I should get going, um...

It's, uh, nice to meet you, sir.

You're, uh, blocking my light.

The IA lady came by.

Greenstreet.

She question you?

Yeah.

She's a babe.

I didn't notice.

You don't think
she's attractive?

I heard a name: Teddy Leaf.

Thinks he's a tough guy.

Tries to prove it
by beating on his women.

He once punched a kid
named Linny Dale

so many times,
her heart stopped.

Did you nail him for it?

No, I didn't have enough.

I got him on a lesser.

Couldn't let it go?

Wouldn't let it go.

You think he shot me?

Us.

You think he shot us?

Hell, I have no idea.

For a while I thought
your nephew shot us.

It's just a guess.

It's a good guess.

One problem.

He's doing a nickel in Concord.

Okay...

Your bust?

My bust.

But then the Boston PD

would know that.

But a hot-shot sheriff

from Paradise wouldn't.

Leaf is a bad guy,

and you have no authority here.

I'm still

State Homicide Commander.

And I'm telling you:

Do not pursue this.

Hey, I'm just a small-town cop.

Mostly, I give out
parking tickets.

I'm telling you
not to pursue this.

I have plans this evening.

This won't take long.

What makes you so sure?

I need you to run
a name for me.

Is that all you need?

No, but it'll have to do.

What's the name?

Teddy Leaf.

We already brought him
in for questioning.

I thought he was in Concord.

He got out on parole
a month ago.


No, just yours.

He came in
with his attorney.

He has an airtight,
triple-witness alibi.

A family function.

There's nothing we can do.

You could give me his picture.

That's probably unethical.

That hasn't stopped us so far.

You're a bad boy.

I am.

SIDNEY: There's Teddy.

Could you print that for me?

And there's
haunts and associates.

Print that.

JESSE: That's illegal.

It's okay.

I'm a doctor.

Great coffee.

Where do you get it?

You're in my chair.

It's a lot better
than my coffee.

You want to wear my hat?

Where you been?

Fighting crime.

Where you been?

Working on the shooting?

Yes.

Why are you here?

Did you find the trigger?

I got a name.

He's got an airtight alibi.

Airtight's where
all the fun begins.

Guy's got two felony
convictions in LA.

I'd just get him on something
else and put him away for good.

Why not here?

No three strikes.

Two-time loser gets pinched

for anything more
than littering,

and a judge can put him
away for a long time.

I spent a lot of time
in an office like this

when I was a cop.

You miss it?

Every day.

You could go back.

Toxic for me.

Me, too.

Nothing happens here.

You okay?

You got plans tonight?

That don't involve
me and network TV?

Yeah.

No.

I'll buy you dinner.

I'd like that.

(children speaking indistinctly)

I'm taking you off
light ad, Suit.

You mean it?

Yes.

The town council okay it?

They will.

How about a doughnut, Rose?

They're coply.

Jesse?

My body's a temple.

Clearly, you have transcended.

Suit, I need you
to do me a favor.

Anything, Jesse.

He's not here, Jesse.

I talked to the school board.

I told Hansen's wife I was thinking
of home-schooling my youngest.

She gave me all the names.
There are no seven-year-old boys.

There aren't even six
or eight-year-old boys.

Well, maybe you need to

expand the search.

Check seven-year-olds
in Swampscott and Beverly.

But the letter
was mailed from Paradise.

You've been looking
for someone who's here

in the second grade.
You need to be looking

for someone who was in
kindergarten two years ago.

Because?

The only way I'd write
a letter like that would be

if I was moving,
leaving town for good.

If that letter was
postmarked two years ago,

you need to check
enrollment two years ago.

I need to go back
to the beginning.

(indistinct conversations)

You showing
the flag?

They need to see you
in the trenches, Jesse.

I wrote four tickets.

Four parking tickets.

Nothing at the speed trap?

You know, there was a tree
in front of the sign,

and somebody cut it down.

A vandal?

A police chief.

Okay.

This guy Teddy Leaf's
a real creature of habit.

He eats lunch at 12:00
at the same place every day.

And whoever drew up his
haunts list did a fine job, but

I added a timeline.

That's good police work, Suit.

I really appreciate this.
I feel like I'm all the way

back, Lou.

Just don't tell the town
council where you were.

Jesse, Eric Morton.

Born December 28, 2000.

Same day as

Adam Blue.

Parents?
Um...

Stephanie Morton, mother.

No father listed.

Is there a
work address?

I don't want to talk
in front of the kid.

It could be just
a coincidence.

Cops don't like
coincidences.

You think he's alive.

I want him to be.

Did you draw me in,
or did I do it to myself?

It's just who you are, Jesse.

ROSE: Excuse me?

Are you Stephanie Morton?
Yeah.

I'm Chief Stone, this
is Officer Gammon.

Hi.
Is there a problem?

Do you own a green Dodge?

STEPHANIE: Yeah.

Have you used it today?

No.
What about lunch?

I make my own.

I have a vegetable garden.

Jesse, we don't need
to bother this...

Excuse me, Rose.

Uh, a green Dodge was used

in the holdup
of a convenience store.

We didn't get the
license number, so

we're just checking every one
that we can.

Have you loaned your car
to anyone, Stephanie?

STEPHANIE: No.

Is this your son?

Yeah, that's my Eric.

He's gorgeous.

Rose, do you mind?

Could your husband
have taken the car?

I'm not married.

I-I-I... don't know
who Eric's father is.

I had a lot of issues
back then.

Drugs and...

Eric changed all that.

From the first time
I held him in my arms, he...

Well...

listen, um, I don't think
there's anything to be

concerned about.

There's probably a hundred

green Dodges
in the county.

So, thank you.

Nice to meet you,
Stephanie.

We could have
pushed harder.

If she thinks we suspect,
she could run.

Should we talk
to the son?

What's he gonna tell us?

We can't risk it.

Jesse, what if this
<i>is</i> a coincidence?

You take any
group of 23 kids,

and odds are, two of them
will have the same birthday.

You made that up.

No, I didn't.
How do you know?

I just know.

You know, if we're wrong
about this,

we damage a couple lives.

So, what are
we going to do?

Knock on doors.

Accumulate data.

But she did it.

She's the one.

Last call?

I'm good.

(quiet chatter,
pool balls clacking)

(indistinct chatter)

(quiet laugh)

(water dripping)

(belt buckle clinking)

(toilet flushing)


You shot me.

Who the hell are you?

State Homicide.
Let me see your hands.


I believe you know the position.



You got a badge?


(heavy breathing)

Yeah? So?

You armed?

No. That'd be a violation
of my parole.


You a little sore there, Teddy?

I'm the one who shot you.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

You tried to kill my friend.

I've already been through this
with the Boston cops.

I saw you.

And I have three people
that saw me elsewhere.

Well, I got a witness--
a reluctant witness--

but we got him on a drug charge.

He'll give you up.

Just when things were going
so well for you.

I'll see you around, Teddy.

(labored breathing)


(children laughing nearby)

I'm here.

Oh. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

Oh, it's no problem.

Rose Gammon. Paradise Police.

(horn honking)

(distant siren)


ROSE: We were told
that a green Dodge

was parked outside
all night long.

Could you verify that?

Oh, Stephanie's car.

Oh, sure.

It's always there.

How long have you
lived here, Mrs...?

Steinberg.

I've lived here forever.


Well, the green Dodge
was involved

in the holdup
of a convenience store,

and we just wanted to be sure
that hers hadn't been stolen.

Hmm. Well, I don't sleep well.

It was here all night.

Okay. Good.

Thank you.

We already interviewed
Mrs. Morton.

She seems very nice.

Well, a freeze-dried hippy.

Oh.
But she, uh,

turned her life around.

How long has she lived here?

Stephanie grew up in that house.

Her mother gave it to her
when Eric was born.

When was that?

Oh, six, seven years ago now.

I remember when she
brought the baby

home from the hospital.

I mean, from the airport.

I told her, you
don't go flying around

at Christmas as big

as a house.

But she went anyway.

Some nonsense about
it being her last

shot at freedom.

And sure enough,

in the middle of nowhere,
she goes into labor

and has the baby.

Can you remember where
in the middle of nowhere

was?

Somewhere out west.

Um, Colorado, Utah,
New Mexico.

Such a lovely boy.

(phone ringing)

I know you're married, but maybe
we could have an affair.

Jesse, it's her.

She had a baby boy
in Albuquerque,

New Mexico,
on December 28, 2000.

His birth certificate said
she named him Eric.

His death certificate said
he lived less than a day.

She put Adam's wristband
on her baby's body.

What do we do?

We've got to be careful.
The media gets a hold of this,

they'll see to it that the world
knows before Elizabeth does.

To me, that's backwards.

Jesse...

She's not going anywhere, Rose.

I need you to trust me on this.

I got to go.

(jackhammer buzzes nearby)

(dog barking)

(horn honking)

(jackhammering continues)

(tires screeching in distance)

(garbled radio transmission)

(distant siren wails)

JESSE: I need some help.

A Paradise town

councilman called.

Some guy named Hansen?

He asked for my report.

Did you give it to him?

No.

He also wanted to know
if you've been

using their cruiser on your
trips to Boston.

I don't have a car anymore.

They know that.

You're on thin ice, Jesse.

They're building
a case against you.

How do you know?

I'm Internal Affairs.
It's what I do.

He did it.

Leave him alone.

I know how you work.

You set people up.

You're going to take him

in an alley
and shoot him?

Legally, we can't

touch him.

I don't
operate under

the same constraints.

I got a friend in the hospital
passing blood.

You cross the line,
I'll put you away.

(garbled radio transmission)

State Homicide.

I need a car.

Marked or unmarked?

Unmarked.

(tires squealing)

(engine revving)

(tires screech)

(rolling thunder)

Did you park in front?

Yes.

Could we go someplace
where it's dry?

No. Talk to me for a while.

Why?

I need you not to ask

any questions.
Why?

That's a question.

I want you
to have plausible deniability.

Why?
I can't tell you.

Why?
Because if

I tell you, you can't
plausibly deny knowing it.

But you know it.
Yes.

(sighs)
Don't look around.

Do you have the two keys?

Yes.

Give me one.

(rolling thunder)

Now shake my hand.

Okay... go to 3A
and use the key.

Where'd you get it?

From a saxophone
teacher.

Will the saxophone
teacher explain?

No, she's not there.

Because?
Because I don't

want her to be.

Turn on the lights
and leave.

Go out the front door,
get in your car and go home.

That's it?

That's it.

You don't want me
to stay for backup?

I want you to give me your word
you'll do as I asked, Suitcase.

You'll explain to me one
day, won't you, Lou?

Yes, I will, Luther.

Oh.

You have
any quarters?

Thanks.

OPERATOR: 911 Emergency.

There's a guy breaking
into my building.

He's got a gun.

407 Arthur.

Help me, please.

(frogs croaking)


(chimes tinkling)


Hello, Jesse.

I've been

expecting you.

Rose.

Did you find the green Dodge?

How long have you known?

Not long.

Why didn't you run?

Come in.

I want to show you something.

I don't expect you
to understand.

I devoted
my whole life

to Eric.

I left it just the way it was
the day he died.

You don't know, do you?

ROSE: "Thin Ice Kills Boy.

"Lewiston, Maine.

"In front of a hundred

"helpless locals skating
on Lake Webb last weekend,

"a five-year-old
vacationing tourist fell

"through a weak spot
in the ice and died.

"Eric Morton's
mother, Stephanie,

"suffered from
extreme hypothermia

"and abrasions when she
jumped in trying to save him.

'It was a horrible,
tragic accident,'

"Fire Chief
Ned Williams said

"in a hastily-arranged
press conference.

'Any death of
a chi...'"

It was an accident.

She sent that letter
the day after he died.

"Your child is loved."

They were here,
hiding in plain sight.

# #

You can only do
what you can do, Jesse.

It happened on my watch.

You got a registered letter.

I signed for it.

It's...

it's from
the town council.

Read it.

Read it out loud.

(envelope tearing)

"This is to officially
inform you

"that you are suspended
without pay,

pending an official
review."



Could you return these
to Captain Healy?

Um, what...

what did you get Teddy Leaf on?

Probably breaking and entering,

concealed carry,
parole violations.

Enough.

They... they want the
keys to your cruiser.

I guess you two
will have to arrest her.

I'd consider it
a personal favor if, uh...

you could wait a while.

How long's a while?

Till I call you.

She's not going anywhere.
