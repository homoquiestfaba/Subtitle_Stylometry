In 926, the capital of Balhae
fell to Georan.

On the territory Georan founded

a new country called Dongranguk,
which means 'Georan of East'.

The survivals of Balhae,

however, kept struggling fiercely
to restore their country.

In 927, Autumn

A raid by the Killer-Blade
Army of Dongranguk!

Form a defense line!

Don't give an inch, just fight back!

Gunhwapyeong!

I'm honored.

The commander of the Killer-Blade Army
has come to pay a personal visit.

I came all the way to ask you something.

Wouldn't you rather cooperate
with Dongranguk?

I'm a human being.

You want me to be a dog
for Georan, like you?

Any last words?

I'm sad to announce

that even our future king, Prince Suhyeon,

has been assassinated by Gunhwapyeong.

Gunhwapyeong,

that traitor is killing off everyone
from the royal family, cutting off the lineage.

Son of a Bitch!

I heard the news has spread all over,

hurting the morale of the people.

It's a big problem.

We need a king at a time like this.

With Prince Suhyeon dead,
who can become our king?

Who else is left?

I've found a prince
whose whereabouts were unknown.

Oh, is there a prince?
Who is he?

Do you remember Prince Jeonghyeon?

What happened?

As you ordered, I sent
Maeyoungok and Mabul to Jungwon.

Youngok...

She always works hard.

According to a secret agent,

Balhae has also dispatched
an excellent fighter...

Who's that?

We don't know yet.

Does anybody have any idea
who it could be?

This time you have to go far.

He's the son of LADY OH.

He was involved in some political strife
14 years ago,

and sent to Jungwon.

He was exiled.

The Killer-Blade Army will be coming.

We must find him before the they do.

We must have a king to unite our people.

If we can unite our people and soldiers,
instead of fighting all over the place,

we can never lose...

Don't forget that.

Balhae's fate depends on him.

How was today?

What about the girl?

Sosam?
Yes.

What have you got?

What do you need to sell?

I'll meet the gentleman first
and tell him.

Gentleman?

Sit over there and wait.

There's no need to doubt.

Just tell me how much you can pay.

There are others who are doing
this kind of business.

Why did you come to me?

I heard there's no later trouble with you.

No trouble when dealing with Sosam.

That's right.

The important thing is whether there will be
trouble or not. The price is the next concern.

So, how much are you asking?

Fifty jeon...

You rat!
That's too cheap!

Is about right,
but I'll give you up to 80 jeon.

Fine.

Hey, Sosam, well...

I'm not sure where you heard of me
but you found the right person.

It's very important
who you deal with here.

You have to find a credible person...

I have a question to ask you.

What is your honorable name?

You were looking for Sosam.

I'm asking for your real name.

There are too many eyes here.
Follow me.

What you have,
only two of them were existed.

I thought I've been seeing strangers lately.

Your Highness,
there must be a misunderstanding.

I'd never misunderstand assassins.

Do me a favor.

Hey, Sosam.

That's no favor...
I thank you.

Don't worry and just go!

A misunderstanding?
Aren't you going to follow him?

I don't think anything
I say will matter right now.

Please, you guys need to help me.

Before that, you must help us first.

We're desperate.

I don't think so

All I have learned is how to kill.

No need to talk to you.

Kill her.

I said "I don't think so".

Okay, okay! Understood.

I would like to know something.

There is so called
"Rules" on the back street.

I know 10 ways to make you speak.

But, I'm not sure you can bear it.

Calm down.
I'm willing to give out everything.

Please sit down.

I'm Yeon Soha,
officer first class of Biseonwon.

Please forgive my discourtesy,
Your Highness.

Of course,
I have to forgive in this situation.

I don't know why you think so,
but I'm not an assassin.

Do you think I'm stupid?

They'll leave an exiled prince alive?

What if other princes...
All the other princes are...

are no more.

Your Highness!
You must become the king of Balhae.

I will be escorting you to Balhae.

I've lived in a place like this,
hiding from assassins for 14 years.

And now that painful time is all gone

and I am to be the king of Balhae, right?

Do you think I believe that?

OK.

Let's say that's all true.
Do you think I'm crazy?

That's only a title. You're saying that
I should become the king

to be chased by Georan,
not knowing when I will be killed?

Do you know what I believe in?

"Survival, above all else."

That's all I'm interested in.

Your Highness!

My kids came back almost all crippled,
which means I lose face.

What are we supposed to do now, huh?

I didn't do it.

Did I say you did it, Prince?

You ain't from battle field, are you?

Tell me.

About what?

Tell me the details
so I can decide on the price.

How much money will you bring me
when I hand you over?

Always the same routine...
They need to be beaten to start speaking.

You... Stop!

She... She's the one!
She attacked us!

Welcome.

I've heard interesting stories
about your skills.

I'm the boss of...

I told you to take your hands off of him.

Not gonna work.
You should talk to me.

I'm the boss of...

Oh, Shit!

Your Highness, are you okay?

What's going on?
They're on the same team!

Please don't worry.

I will protect you.

Bo... Boss...

Yeon Soha... It's you.

You came here.

We've passed a couple of times,

but this is the first time
we've said hello.

What do we do?
There are more than two of them now.

Don't worry.

This is our region.
And we've got more people.

Who are they now?

They're Dongranguk's Killer-Blade army.

Officer Yeon,

wouldn't it be better if we avoided
any unnecessary killings?

Give us Prince Jeonghyeon

and we'll guarantee your life.

I can never allow you to take him.

It's not going to work by talking.

Everyone stop!

What?

Looking at the current situation,
I think you're the one we should join up with.

Get out!

Lt'll be better to talk.

I'm the boss of...

What are we doing?
Kill them!

Your Highness, please run!

What?

We have to run away.
Hurry!

What is the matter?

Your Highness!

They'll keep coming.
You have to keep away from them!

Follow me!

Tell me.

Who are you?

What do you have to do
with the Killer-Blade Army?

Most of them are traitors to Balhae.

In the past, I've seen them
in the military.

Is that why you introduced
yourself like that?

Is there something wrong with
how I introduced myself?

Then, how are you related to
my brother Suhyeon?

I've once guarded
the Crown Prince for a while.

We must go now.

Where to?
This is the safest place.

There is no safe place.

As long as we are here,
they'll eventually find you.

They will kill everyone on Wolnak street
if they need to...

That is the Killer-Blade army's way.

Didn't you say that surviving is
your only interest?

Then there's no other way.

Then follow me,
I know a shortcut out of here.

You want a drink?

Is this the fast way you've mentioned?

We must eat well to go fast.

How can we travel far without eating?

They are the Bidomun, a branch of
Heukdobang's gang. I recognize the symbol.

I heard they are out of their minds
because their boss was killed.

Let's go now.
We don't have much time.

I will decide whether to go or not.

If I don't like it, I won't go.

Who the hell are you?

My boss here told me

to ask you something!

What?
That girl?

What did she say?

She wonders if it's true
that your boss died

from overdoing it with women.

That bitch!

Please just ignore him and let it go.

Too late. We already heard him!

What are you doing?
We are still in mourning for my father.

That guy picked a fight with us.
We didn't have a choice.

I gave you an order to be cautious,
no matter what happened!

Say again what you just said.

I found him! Here! Here!

It's very late.
Let's go now.

Uh... OK... Go quickly.

I appreciate your help very much.

Don't say that.
How can I just ignore this kind of thing?

I wish...

I wish I could cut him though

for your sake...

Everything will be okay, don't worry.

Let's go.

What happened?

After listening to our story,
she said she would help us.

Story?

You told her everything?

Are you out of your mind?

You have no idea how fast rumors
spread in this town.

I said that you abandoned your wife
and children to run away with a widow,

stealing your ill mother's money.

Hey! You're a warrior.
How can you lie to people like that?

Sword is not the only thing
you need in the battle field.

Put these on. It's going to be
a tough walk and quite cold from now on.

That's okay.

I'm not going to care
if you get cold later on.

Let's go.

How did you learn martial art?

I've only trained to use sword.

Where did you learn to use it?

I learned from a military camp.

I had learned from many soldiers
since I was little.

You had one rough life.

I would've give up.

What is going on?

I need to get horses.

I don't think it is possible.

It is not like stealing clothes.

It is way too difficult to steal them.

We have to wait till dawn, and...

Don't worry, I can pay.

Damn, it's hot!
It's killing me...

Wow, who's this! Brother Sosam!

I brought you a customer.
Customer?

Do you like any of them?

I want to buy the one on the far right
and the fourth one.

You know your horses.
But they are quite expensive...

Since you came with Brother Sosam,

I'll give you a good deal.

For the two, give me 300 jeon.

I live off of you, Brother.

But they're real good horses!

But they're stolen.
Shhh! Come on...

She's fine. Who is she?

A devil from hell.
Come to take me to die.

What? Never understand a single word...

Anyway let me take a sword.
I'd better carry one

since someone's trying to kill me...
Let's see.

This one should be good.

Why did you choose that one?

Take a better one.
I'll pick one for you.

Doesn't matter.
I'll never use it anyhow.

You surprised me...

You're here again.

No word from the Deputy Commander yet?

Please don't worry...

Maeyoungok has never lost her quarry.

Wouldn't it depend on who the quarry is?

Have you found out?
Of course!

Do you know a female warrior
called Yeon Soha?

I'll go myself.

Are you going to kill the prince
again this time?

The royal court wants
Balhae's royal family to cooperate.

To help calm the conflicts and uprisings
all around the country.

But because you've been killing
every member of the royal family,

the court can't trust you.

If you want to gain something big,
you'd better control your vengeful spirit.

Understand?

Father!

Welcome!

How can I help you?

We don't need dinner.
Give us a place to stay.

Yes!

How many rooms...

Can't you see?
There are two people.

Then I'll prepare...

Give us one room.

One's enough.

Are you going to stay
like that all night?

This is the way Biseonwon warriors

guard the door of the king
until he falls asleep.

Please do not worry.

If you're going to be silly,
you'd better come in and be silly.

You're going to be the king.

There shouldn't be
any kind of scandalous rumors.

Are we in Balhae?
Who's going to see?

Whoever's watching or not
is not important.

Under the heavens,
The king should have nothing to hide.

You speak as if I'm going to be the king.

When did I say I would?
I'm not going to.

He said they went to Hadong.

The Chief Commander is coming.

Hey, Officer Yeon Soha!

You said you grew up in the military.

Was your father a soldier?

No, Sir.

Then, why?

I didn't have anywhere else to go.

Georan soldiers killed my father
when I was 9,

my mother when I was 10...

I didn't have any other relatives.

It'll be tough to get to Hadong today.

There's a place to stay near there.
A very cozy place.

What's that?

That incense...

It's my habit to comfort the dead.

Those who I used to know and the enemies
who have been killed by my sword.

You comfort even the souls
of your enemies?

With no hatred or resentment?

At least you won't be eaten
by an evil spirit.

Why?

I also learned how to use
the sword in Balhae.

I know the story

that evil spirits born from the resentment,
spite, and hatred,

that lives on in your sword.

Grown-ups used to scare me
with the story

that an evil spirit grows
by drinking blood

and finally makes the owner of
the sword evil as well.

I learned when I grew up

that the story meant one shouldn't
lose serenity because of hatred.

I believe evil spirits grow in the sword.

Do you still believe what you were told
when you were little?

That is why you treat it so carefully.

It protects you from evil spirits.

Yes.

I believe I have to use the sword

to protect my important things.

Hey...

What would people think
when they hold the sword?

Protecting? No way...

Killing comes the first.

That is instinct.

I have tried to tell a couple of times,

don't give me that look.

Don't give me that pity look.

I have had a fairly great life
until I met you.

I need to meet someone.
Wait here for a while.

We don't have much time.
There's still a long way to go...

It's the owner of this shop.

Don't go anywhere, just wait here.

It'll only take me a moment.

Hey, who's this?

Here you go!

What are you doing here,
without telling us you were coming?

I'd like to get back my money
that you're keeping for me.

It looks like I'll have to go
in hiding for a while.

What have you done?

It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

So where are you going this time?

Well...
For now, quite far...

Sosam, to be honest, some people
came by here yesterday.

Who?

They... Said they were
with the Killer-Blade Army.

And they're looking for you!

Let's talk.

Did you think you could
get away from me?

Let me ask you one thing.

Would you like to cooperate
with Dongranguk?

Negotiate?
I don't know what you mean by that...

You...

Why are you trying so hard

to take me?

Because you're going to be
Balhae's king.

You've seen how I live.

Do you think the throne fits me?

You'll be an excellent king.

Thank you for thinking highly of me,
but let me tell you one thing.

I was going to leave you here
and run away.

I failed because my friend betrayed me.

If you were really going to do that,
there were a lot of chances.

Why do you think I'm telling you this?

I have no intention to go to Balhae.

If I hope to survive,
there are many other ways.

You have to go no matter what.

Then tell me one good reason
why I must go to Balhae.

Why do I have to go there?

As far as I know, you weren't present
at your mother's deathbed.

We'll pass by Cheonaegok
on the way.

There is a graveyard.

Your Highness!

Long time no see.

I know only one thing.

My father and family were dishonored

and brutally killed by
the royal family of Balhae.

The charges against them
were not false.

I don't care who says what.

I will kill whoever insulted
my father and family.

Your Highness, are you OK?

No, I'm not OK.

Do you know how terrible
it is to be stabbed from behind?

A message came from headquarters.
What would you like to do?

Say we haven't found them.

I'm not going back
before I kill Yeon Soha.

Kill Yeon Soha?

As long as I'm under orders,
I want to take care of it on my own.

And...

I don't want to cause trouble to you,
most of all.

I will give you four days.

If I see Yeon Soha,

you'll have no more chances.

It was quite close.

I guess it may not be that serious...

It is from the street fight.

It is from the battle field.

What made you think...

I wouldn't even get close to it.

I was told you joined the majesty,
your father,

for the battle against Georan
when you were only fifteen.

Georan soldiers!

They seem dropping
out of the headquarters.

Your highness!

Look at this chaos.

They wouldn't have time to pack.

They wouldn't even dare to fight, but run.

What is that for?

It is for you since you are not well.

It seems so convenience.

Hand it over.

I will do, your highness.

Why?

Have you ever done carpenter's work?

I had to fix stuffs to sell.

Some dorks broke things
when they stole goods.

What? This is what I have been doing.

You see!
I'm not even close to be a King.

You made wrong decision.

General KeumHwee.

For the fifteen years old prince

who was brave and fought in the battle field,
every soldiers called you by that name.

With glint helmet,

You were surely stand out in the battle field.

How well do you know about me?

There were many princes
who fought in the field

but no one could even get close to
what you had done.

You are the one people rely on
in this harsh time.

I'm nobody.

All that is left is useless myself, Sosam.

Your real nature wouldn't have changed.

That is wrong.

I have confidence in you.

Don't be silly.
What if you are wrong?

I bet my life on that.

Do we have to do that?
