I can tell you everything about
all the attractions of the city.

From Voodoo to the French Opera
House.

We know everything.

Go along to the favorite place
the 'literazzi.

And you can also Hades visits.

The above-ground tombs
New Orleans.

The museum in Jackson Street...

Holds not only ancient
city maps...

But also the Rosary
Marie Antoinette.

Interested in money?
And who is not?

Why have you done successfully, Captain?
Where did I fall flat?

Was it blue?
Yes, according to the rules is that

prohibited.

That was it.
Absolutely brilliant and fantastic.

Pull that silver lame and enjoy
of a real alien.

Sorry.

Fast.

I could not resist.

She saw me.

She could recognize me.

Why did she do something so stupid?
Bad timing.

I had to finish it r.
Get out.

Are you the valium
my watch or run too fast?

Why do you now smoke?
It's a good time.

A woman could not wait for the elevator
and took the stairs.

Temporarily or permanently
disabled?

Death.
Nice. Creepy, but beautiful.

Why?
They know we mean it.

Sat you mean?
You really are a special.

Dear Jesus,
My name is Coco Chavez.

I do not know why I
now addressing you.

Life has its uncertainties.

Kidnapping is actually
only for suckers.

But this was my idea.

Junior and I were occupied
with blackmail.

Shall we go to the room?

I never do this
during working hours...

But can I learn from you
than one course.

Help yourself, cowboy.
Come on.

Good.

You are truly unique.
So do we.

I'll be ready.

Your wife wants five thousand
per month...

The car and the beach,
otherwise she gets to court.

I would only draw.

When I read Career information
The manual for the cheat.

We chartered Sloth Browning.

An eccentric who occasionally
appeared in the environment.

Who are we?
Where have you been?

This requires everyone.
Harvard.

Why did I not support them.
How you doing?

We murder 1 6-year olds
for fun.

It only kills you profits?

You really have to Harare.

This is a romantic dinner.
Should I go?

Just be just
something more charming.

Still in the separations,
business?

Not for long. I'm doing
with a kidnapping.

Come on, even a child knows
kidnapping is for suckers.

What are you talking about?
I do not want more fake orgasms.

Kidnapping?
Why not?

I recently worked for a
accountant Dyscan...

Dyscape?
That company is worth billions.

If you are not in your computer,
You can do anything.

That guy is a genius.

Accountant who governs
insurance and such.

He says that if Ben Dyson
kidnapped...

Dyscape straight four million
pay.

Without a question.

The man is worth billions.
So they got him insured.

He must have one billion bodyguards
and alarm systems.

We talk about the big money.
It is worth it.

Why do you say is true for Sloth?
Because he was not participating.

Not fancy enough.

But you do not stop us, eh?

I'll call you guys. The dinner
I pay. Buenas noches.

Who does too.
I'm going Dyson's house.

I thought it was my turn.
You can always do the fun stuff.

You go find strength.

If you're in New Orleans muscle
needed...

You had to have Poppy Malavero.

A throwing ex-minister in New
Orleans

known as the Bible.

And Jesus, he knew the Bible
better than God.

Miss Chavez.
Mr. Malavero.

Read the book still?
Not since you did not preach.

You still go to church?

You should know that the church
changes in foolish ways.

I'm sorry that I
so behaved, Coco.

Everyone had done it.

It was the perfect place for it.

You were a beautiful chorus girl.

Sal!

What's that kid-Mormons
again? Middleweight.

Middleweight?

Sergio. Sergio Dos Veces.
That I mean.

How was it out of the junkyard?
It has cost him an arm.

And one eye.
I can do find out.

Ruben Ruben Bauer.
Ruben Ruben Bauer.

Totally cool. This German kid
makes some really good things.

He stood on guard
in a jewel heist...

And was attacked by
a door with two pit bulls.

He puts the odds porter
and demolishes those dogs.

Silent Death, provided the instruction.

The others come out.
They had heard nothing.

Sal has his number.
Thank you, Poppy.

The man is clean.

According Poppy are you crazy
but never caught.

And what do you think?
I do not know.

I trust not. Or you
always lucky, or you're a snitch.

What are you thinking?

You do not know.
Say it then.

Clever answer.

I think of you in all
indecent positions.

Where are you from?
I?

From Wanna-Acorn,
North Rhine Westphalia.

And what do they do?
Dogs in flames stabbing...

Drinking and their sisters
chasing.

Are you poor?

Let me see.

Shows.

Well, maybe I'll call you.

You're crazy and stupid.
Maybe I'll call you.

Do you know the mambo?

That dance.
I call it the "save me dance.

I am the best muscle bundle
you can get.

And I kill everything.
With guns or knives.

But I get nervous when applying.
Then I do a bit tough.

But if we do both
nothing to lose...

The mambo.

Rubens mambo was the deciding factor.

But on the next
we were not prepared.

Are you well prepared?
That we see so well.

Sew me Junior.
Right now?

I must be calm.
Too much adrenaline.

I want ultra-kinky,
Feast hat lit sex.

Your heart is pounding almost
your chest out.

Throw me on the mattress
otherwise I'll go to Mexico...

For a few of the muchachos
Ava Gardner who also was in that movie.

Do you get air?

Are you well?

Do you go to the bathroom or something?

You can talk, you know.

We are not insane or anything.

Are we nuts?
No.

Yes, I have to go to the bathroom.

Dammit, Junior.

You touch me in places
no man ever touched me.

You make everything in my wake.

I'm so in love with you.
You're just up for religious experience.

Sorry about today.
I mean it.

This makes up for it.

We can still go lsla Margarita.
Piña Colada's and each other.

They have rum?
Yes.

I am not a Piña Colada type.

Or they have nothing else.

Rum-cola then. I like the way
which you run your ass.

We're on TV.

The police in Park Circle 351...

With computer giant
Ben Dyson was abducted.

In his apartment was Patricia Hornbeck
found dead.

The wife of Senator Hornbeck.

It is unclear whether the murder in
related to the kidnapping...

But such a large police
power we have never seen.

And?
This is not your concern anyway?

Grimes has broken his foot.
I'm falling for him.

The maid 's body was found.
The doorman is in hospital.

We start with the maid.
Give me a tape recorder, coffee...

And send guests away.

Boys...
Get out.

This just once, Miss Ruiz.

Were you at the time of the murder
in the flat?

Where were you?
On Thursday I do the

messages.

When I came back,
I opened the door...

And I saw the woman lying.
I have very loud screaming.

I have never...

Did you know her?

Was she a friend
Mr. Dyson?

When you discovered that Mr.. Dyson
disappeared?

I called in January 1991, and the police
wanted to wait on Mr.. Dyson.

They waited and waited.
And when they saw that outfit.

I had picked up
when I got home.

What kind of world do we live?

I think God is asleep.

Friedman?

Commissioner?

The butler did it.
Sorry it took so long.

Want to meet the senator?

I heard that he
can not play poker.

He is a man with power.

FBI Agent Hawkins, the
kidnapping, you do the murder.

Use all your resources...

And pretend that you like,
because you walk them to the feet.

I do not want.
The senator and I are friends.

I do not want.

Grimes will take some sick,
So you're gonna do it.

I do not want.
I know.

For clarity...

Dyscape to life
Mr. Dyson is not in jeopardy.

We are prepared to the requirements
to meet the kidnappers...

And four million to deliver
to be determined by their place...

Ýn exchange for Mr.. Dyson.

Tonight at eight hours
we would be called.

My daughter also has "one computer.
Those things are really nice.

We want the authorities happy
help, but we will not...

The kidnappers of the
Line hold or mislead.

That is our position.

Pamper me "s.

That is a sexual remark,
Agent Hawkins.

Okay, you've never
had a female boss.

I'm in the office,
I've never shot.

I do this for my father.

For a PhD, I ready to suck...

Even if they wanted to do
has a wife.

I'm stupid
and you're usually right.

And I'm in love with you
but do not show it.

Forget something?

You drive better but I will
never admit it.

Keep me posted,
then you can always help us.

How thoughtful of you.
Heard of that door?

I'm going to the hospital.
And the upstairs neighbor?

Mary-Ellen Floyd, she played tennis
with the wife of the senator.

Will you come to the senator?
Lie on top of you like?

Usually, yes.
Later sex?

Just call my ex.
Then I call my ex.

Too bad Joyce hits as
liked, then it was not done.

You know Jim Thompson.
Not bad for a detective.

I'm full of contradictions,
Agent Hawkins. Just wait.

Mr. Gordon?
What is left of it. Who are you?

Detective Friedman.
Do you mind?

I saw almost nothing.

Only something with a guy who
the monitor was on the tenth.

He was standing near the camera.
Dark hair...

Late twenties and early thirties.

Maybe forty.

I'm just not very good.

But...

You're the last person
Mrs. Hornbeck alive saw.

I'm sorry that you so quickly
again to retell story.

I wish I knew more.

Patty and I played
tennis every Thursday.

Sometimes she went after
showering here.

It's insane.
She was so clever, so witty.

She was my best friend.
We knew each other for fifteen years.

She left my apartment...

And she was murdered
because they took the stairs.

It's pathetic.
I miss her already

I beg you...

From the bottom...

Of my soul,
this Gajes to detect.

I want them to stand trial
with all of that means.

Then I make a new law
which we can

call it.

I swear.

I beg you guys
forgive my behavior.

But I can see my feelings
not express in words.

I hope...

That none of you
This will ever know.

These bastards have
signed their death warrant.

And?
Hack.

That is not enough?
Dyson knows anything yet.

In such transfer
they can catch us.

I had 'r death to shoot.
Why? That had been the same.

Four million.
I always make everything.

Besides my school then.

We have until tomorrow.
Yes, they still find us al.

With beaucoup people.
Now let's hack.

Then they'll never find.
A careless does not matter.

That does matter.
We are now...

What word do I search?
Suspicious. We are suspicious.

They had had nothing
but now they are angry.

We call them tonight.
We do it or we do not.

Do you get along?
I was not cut.

With Walters.
We are intercepted.

Go to Capri's Pizza.
You have five minutes.

I told you so.
Be happy for your boss.

How's he doing?
Crying.

Soon he still gets
a salt shortage.

May I Mr.. Walters?

Who is the FBI agent
standing next to you?

Her name is Hawkins.
No, I want to talk to you.

But say that the fruit
panini's very good.

A mobile.
How long?

Piece of cake.

A silver box, model 399.
With black handles.

Four million used tickets.

You must repeat all of them?
I'll call you tomorrow at noon.

Twelve o'clock?
Then you have the money yet.

Then I have the money yet.

Are you an early bird?
Pardon?

He switches from line.
Not bad.

Are you an early bird?
Yes.

Than eight hours.

Eight o'clock in the morning?
Try to postpone it.

I can only cash afternoon
control. Then the bank open...

Six hours.
You call for six hours.

If you go, the more
earlier, right?

Clear.
Say you're sorry.

I'm sorry.
May I Mr.. Dyson?

No need to cry.
Tomorrow you'll be back Fri

I know this happens quite brutally
but we really do no harm.

Come to the phone.
Your accountant to see you.

Do not be a coward.

If you're her 's stores,
and how much you're worth...

I ram your brains out.
Got it?

Calm down, people.
It should be called.

Okay?

I've never in my face
beaten. It really hurts.

That cop me never.
I would not dare.

Coward and was right
love meant.

Well, then up to five hours.
Here Dyson.

Who is this?
Walters.

Accounting. You okay?
It could be better, Walters.

We're going to save you.

He lives. I'll call you for four hours.
And the luck to Hawkins.

And if you lie again
I cut into a thousand piece Dyson choose.

Dyson was that?

Detective?
Got him before?

The transfer to four hours.
Then I have lots of time.

If we do not tackle.
I take everything into consideration.

If you do screw up they are gone.
Kidnappers always make mistakes.

I am so glad that the FBI
scientific progress.

Lick my dick, say.
Here?

Is it too late to a grieving
witness to look?

Not if you bring flowers.

See you at Dyscape.

Miss Floyd, sorry to bother again.
I had forgotten my lighter.

It sounds pretty...
But it's an heirloom from my father.

Thank you.

Thanks again.
No thanks.

We had but at bedtime.

Patty was not bad.
That will be good.

You do not have to be bad
to a victim.

I would do anything for her,
you understand that?

It is not for me to decide
what is right or wrong.

She loved him.
She really loved...

I'm sure.

And it was quite something be.

It was something to be
between Patty and the senator?

Patty and Ben.
Patty Hornbeck...

And Ben Dyson.

They had a relationship.

She was so happy. Finally
she had the luck on her side.

How long were they together?

The past three months
they came here every Thursday.

They went almost one year
with each other.

Time to sleep.
Tomorrow is another day...

And then we all
a new opportunity.

Tell me your dreams again.

I dream that I am bound
in a barn...

With horns on my head
and a cowbell around my neck...

And me from behind
am by a huge bull.

I mean your ambitions.
What do you want?

I am the most available space
girl in this universe.

You do not do crazy things
to get my clothes off.

Four hours is too early.
Then let him wait for nine

hours.

Four hours is too early.
Then let him wait for nine

hours.

At the next show is...

Is not it a bit early?
Not if you drink as much as I do.

Happy reading.

I would like Dyson phone bills
also see.

I do everything, but this is crazy.
Over 1 5 minutes, the

cleaners.

Shoot it.

Thanks, Friedman.

We have one go to eat.
Sure. The best.

Did you sleep last night?
Pardon?

How many hours?
Four, as always. And you?

Too.

We can also eat leaves.

Reuben, do that thing away.
The bacon is already dead.

I have never until
nothing slain.

You had the chance.
I had her shot.

But Coco was huge.

Really. You were great.
You do not even froze.

I do my first murder remember.

I completely froze.
Well, except my ass then.

I had a week schijterij.

But do not you, eh?

Do you like to have your baby
mother's nipple bitten off?

You keep your good.

I had hitherto only
shot on beer cans.

Once a bird,
but then I was drunk.

I want to just
you just say so...

So you know...

You're doing really good, considering...

Excuse me.

I feel sick.
Pregnant?

If only it were true.
You know best.

Give me a break, you had no choice.
Why no choice?

What should I say?
That you had to fuck?

Because that is not. You did
Just what to do.

But you're not a monster.
I had ever slain.

Until then, you did everything right.
It was just one incident.

Until then, you did everything right?
What does this mean?

That means...

What it means.

Listen, you and me...

Have been through so much.
Good and bad things.

But we always feel
of humor had.

Life is a comedy.

Now if you collapse, drag me.
For we are one.

We're just the same.
And this is life.

We learn from our mistakes.

And you should not think that this
incident are now at risk.

Because we know that only
when this is over.

So to be afraid
We both have nothing.

Make sure you live.

Because I can do without you,
but I do not want.

You have a perfectly oiled
machinery put in motion.

Now you take away.

Go take a bath, Go watch TV...

Read a book, do something.

See you in a couple of hours,
I promise you.

Promise bad luck.
Then I promise not.

But I do love you.

Ruben is the deal.
I leave it to you back.

Keep an eye on Sloth.

Go with that banana.

Should not you be doing?

Is this an interview?
With you, you never know.

Are we here all day wait?

You still get paid?
Yes, I get paid.

And you have FBI protection.

Usually you get only
if you gangsters denounced.

Take your shoes off.
Enjoy life.

Showtime.

Go to Wally's Auto Shop.
You have 32 minutes.

I'll be there.
Of course.

The senator is not really fast.

Detective, I'm afraid
The Senator has no time for you.

Bang...

Ýs the key word here.

Lee Ann, with Rickles.
Leave the car ride.

I drink now three quarters
bad coffee...

Waiting for his highness.

I understand that his dead wife
not valuable enough...

Time to five minutes
to spend...

But I soon of time.

I do not like your tone, Detective.
I need to talk to you.

I'm all ears
from here to the car.

Your wife had a relationship with Dyson.

I'm not surprised. We had
relationships with all celebrities.

I mean a different kind of relationship.
Is it something obvious?

She had a relationship with Dyson.
It will be your own wife had

are.

They called each other every day.
Listen, asshole.

I do not know what your
intention is...

But as the blackening People

part of your research...

I'll go here with
Commissioner talk.

I have no time for your pathetic
are destroying...

But I know people Sat
You speak to me again.

You'll never look at me.

If I see you here again,
drill so many sources...

Ýt certainly will last 50 years
before you have dug.

I thought you were Matty.

Matty Grimes?
Your cars look alike.

Have a nice day.

I've tried once.
But I do not know why.

Just once?
Amateur.

You too?

Really?
I'm not dwell on mistakes.

You lie.
Maybe.

But who will ever know?

If you commit suicide,
I will never forget...

The blood and dreadful
grimace in the mirror.

But from that moment
it all romantic.

Just like all those rumors.
Sloth is perhaps a cop...

Or maybe he
really killed his parents.

You do not know.

Exactly. And it's all
so unimportant.

Chatter. Junior and you were
high school sweethearts, huh?

If we stay at school.
What you got to know each other?

I had a crazy boyfriend.
Jiminy Cricket.

I know them.
Pinocchio who helped you?

Japie used speed and had
absolutely no confidence.

He was spanking me with an violin.

We stripped off-licenses
and had only oral sex...

Because he was afraid that I
become pregnant.

He dared not even me kissing.

He said his spittle
was rich in sperm.

But I was young and he had a
cool engine, so what do you do?

We could hack into the supermarket
where Junior worked.

According Japie pe
a reliable guy.

We would go through the freezer door.
Japie but did not show.

That was often done
and I began to doubt him.

I went in alone
Junior and looked at the drink stand.

The freezer came out in the store.
Since he was hiding.

But the watchman was come along

and who had him imprisoned.

When I appeared he was half paralyzed.
Not a good start, so.

We decided to do nothing and
then came to climb outside Japie.

He saw the door open...

And did it shut
to avoid arousing suspicion.

Junior and I decided then
but drunk.

That night we made
to change the world.

And ourselves.

We went off like rabbits.

Staring at a dead cow
I experienced my first orgasm.

That smell of blood and fresh meat
I'll never forget.

I immediately felt
I was in love.

How did you get out?

When the supermarket opened,
we just ran out.

Junior took immediate dismissal.

And if I see a steak,
I get wet.

They have a yellow jig cart.
And a van, very unobtrusive.

And another car for that truck.

It gets a wife.
The leader. Nice type.

Tell him I put them on here
all shut-off.

Ruben said...
I've heard. I'll call you.

No, Mrs. Gurwitz. The distributor
was okay, it was the radiator.

And we have been replaced.

We have a problem.
I do not have that thing out of it.

Can they not wait?
What?

I do need the phone, Mr.. Wally.
This is a matter for the police.

You're not a cop.
Fuck.

Get out your Mr. Wally.

No, ma'am. We are already working
Mercedes has been with yours

I'll just look in the file.

Women...

You never let me wait.
Sorry.

What are you doing?
I need to call.

What is it?
Wally saves your accountant so rotten.

He calls for help.
Officers go inside.

Wally she threatens
with a tire iron.

Male officers?
Yes. Walters inside.

Do you play a game?
A mechanic grabbed and bit me...

Do you think I am a child?

Dyson will not like it
so you play with his life.

I was really on time.
Shut up.

Tell that Hawkins
that van to buzz off.

Yet it is a lie and Dyson.
And I promise you.

Go to the Three Horseshoes Motel.
Since I'll call you. Take a taxi.

And if I see friends there as well,
I will shoot you dead.

He must go to a motel.
They keep an eye on us.

They can not see you. Let
motel investigations cameras.

Otherwise they'll never see.
Unless they themselves are at the motel.

But if they are not stupid.

Submit an agent
with the accountant.

They see us. Be careful if you have anything
sees that "one kidnapper seems.

It is no weekend, Dave.
I come for Matty.

Hello, Tinkerbell.
Bye, Dad.

Do not you go to school?
She has a cold.

Matty is there.

All kits, Friedman?
I come here to visit.

The boys miss you.
We hope you are soon recovered.

You lie worse than me.

What can I do for you?
I've got the Hornbeck case.

I heard that. Make me
pride, but not too proud.

I did my job badly.

Coincidentally enough, that you just
at the moment your foot breaks.

Everything has its reason. Usually
The reason is that life cunt.

I do not want to rush,
but I just want to nap.

Do you Hornbeck well known?
He is an ex-policeman.

He can totally play poker.
Did you often with him?

Friedman, I like you
very happy, really.

But what if you want to ask
please do so.

Do you Patty Hornbeck bugged?

You have not slept yet, eh?
You're the expert. Yes or no?

I keep myself away from the stupid.

I do not promote
but I will not die.

I have not bugged.
I ask you very sweet.

I do not want that job.
You must get away from it.

You're going to see ghosts.

What are you doing?
You're bluffing, I want to see.

Put that thing away.
I want to break your foot.

Which is already broken.

Then you can never jump.
Say goodbye your foot.

Stop.
Have you listened to her?

I'll get you.
I swear.

Yes or no?

Impaired idiot.

Well?
Yes.

A taxi.
Walters gets into.

You see the driver?
No. Is one of them?

Absolutely. The FBI
never had a fantasy.

Hang.

Sloth is right.
Walters carries a transmitter.

Leave it to Robin about that one.

If they do not go away
you are going one by one.

How do you feel?
Nervous, but that's normal.

And Sloth?

Which states that feeble
yoga thing to do.

But if he stays calm.
I'll call you for five hours.

Have you eaten?

Rolo come here for?

Pardon?
That is in fact arrested.

Who?
Rolo.

Reception. Who?

Rolo has been arrested.

Who? I do not know Walters.

Who is Rolo?
No idea.

Agent can hear this?
Which agent?

You want to die?

See that green bench behind you?

Underneath my phone and show a note.
Read it and tear 't.

Fuck you.

That was not against you.
I'm used to it.

TAKE THE TRAIN February 1 HOUR.

TAKE THE PHONE WITH YOU
AND THE CASE

That bastard can not see me.

And when the woman goes with it,
she is brilliant.

You must now but alone.

I have four minutes the train.

Send two cars behind the train.

I said he had to wait.
He is already inside.

Let us only.

You replaced Matty for me.
What have you against me?

Your entrance was great, but now I
You talk nonsense. What do you mean?

Ben Dyson and Patty Hornbeck
had a relationship.

Hornbeck had her listen
by Matty.

I'm talking about corruption in
Police on a large scale.

It was clear that I
job would not...

Because it is illegal as what
but you wanted me to sew.

What have you against me?

The citizen has no idea how
is required of law enforcement.

You mean?
Thank you first come to me.

And do you do for me?
You are too quick with your conclusions.

As a Dyson and Mrs. Hornbeck
affair

had, it was a coincidence.

Give me a break.
Coincidence, nothing more.

There is no coincidence, Commissioner.
You know best.

I expect a report
clues and suspects, ASAP.

There is only one suspect.
There is only one killer.

Can I Rupert Hornbeck arrest?

I just do this or I not heard.

Shall we take a swim?
With all that gear you sink right away.

Some people find dirty iron.
I never thought about it.

I wish women tasted like iron.

You really do
for psychologists.

That's what my mother already.

With Walters.
About two hours Dyson let go.

Put the window open
and thus throw out the suitcase.

Now...

FBI!
Stop!

Ruben, come on now!

Get in!

This is it.

This is it!
Not too much to watch.

I've never seen so much dough.
It gives me a hard-on.

Soon the wind out of the window.

Close the window.

You know, I have sometimes
dreamed of...

But it did not fit even
in my head.

Still not.
My head almost pops apart.

Like I have epilepsy.
A stroke?

No, such epilepsy.
A vision.

You mean an epiphany.

I thought she was just as
would do as in movies.

Money top
and newspapers underneath.

And there was I been happy.

But this is completely full.
They've really done.

Do you know "Objective, Burma"
with Errol Flynn?

I do not like old movies.

Why not?
I want to talk about it.

Errol Flynn, is a gay?
I think Errol Flynn died.

I mean, was he a gay?
How should I know?

Cary Grant was feeling gay,
and Rock Hudson.

You know what was in
My mom happened?

She was devastated. They have
its so terribly disappointed.

When I see an old movie,
then I always think:

Maybe my mother love
on him but he is a gay.

And I get so sad.
Something there.

Why do you stop?
A new battery.

What happens in that movie?

Flynn and a few soldiers
jump off the plane...

Above the jungle.

Someone asks Flynn
What if my parachute does not open?

Says Flynn:
Well, you're the first down.

What does that mean?
Nothing.

I need the money.
Are you a man of your word?

I've never been bothered.
Got something for me?

Ellroy Street 551 5.
Open the box under your seat.

Senator? That girl that
Dyson is unarmed.

Hawkins, where you stay?
I come.

He leaves now.

Here I am.

I hope you're sure.
It is becoming increasingly uncertain.

Do you have money?
Hush money?

To park.

It's wrong.

Time is not linear.
What do you mean?

If you have a time on your watch
look, I vil you alive.

Do you know something I do not know?
This question is an open book.

Stop it.
I just take breath.

That haughty stuff is boring.

You're so good with words.

And let alone the hostage,
you're too impatient.

When they asked Thompson
how he came all the plot...

He said that there is only one plot.

You can not win them all.
Almost.

Nothing is what it seems.

Why are you not a writer more?

Go follow him.

Why me?
He does not like me. Hurry.

Follow the green car.
What kept you?

She sold Tupperware.
What do you mean?

I was worried.

Hornbeck him a given address.

Standard. A .357. What old-fashioned,
but I love it.

Do you smoke?

Beautiful things. Are you a
health freak...

Or did you never act tough?

I smoke since my twelfth.
So I never stop.

If I ask a question,
You will not beat me?

I want to know how it feels...

Ýf you think you it goes.

I mean anything with.
Murder because we do not really...

And this is not
torture technique.

You must think that you die
because you think we are crazy.

I want to know what you feel,
but fear and insecurity and so on.

I want to know if you feel
will receive a revelation.

A kind permission.

Resolutions and such.

You want to say anything, huh?

I thought maybe you
talk to someone.

This car 340.

Can I have an ambulance?

At the corner of Ellroy Street.

You was not kidding
about your driving style, eh?

Because anyway...

When this is over,
you still need years of therapy.

How did that story again?

About those scientist
who builds the first computer.

A perfect machine. He works days
and night and he is finally ready.

He switch on
and his first question is:

Is there a god?
And the computer says:

What did that say?

I am now.

I knew it.
I wanted you to talk.

So you will not kill me?
No, if you believe me at least.

May I ask you something?
Yeah. I want to talk.

Why did you kill Patty?
Patty Which?

You knew the wife of the senator.
Yes.

It was our
so little time awarded.

God, why did this
Thursday one happen?

I'm going effe shower.
What a news.

Go along.

Make sure you never feel you
loss of humor.

I'm going Dyson's house.

We go on Thursday.
The weekend was so much better?

Thursday,
I feel it in my crotch.

I am getting dizzy when I
to cross your mind. But Sloth...

He can get the plague.
Who invented it? He or I?

And we do it on Thursday.
I dream about it already.

This guy has fixed billions
bodyguards, and alarm systems.

And then we go inside.
It's too simple.

Simple is good.

That gives confidence.

Why do you take the gun?
Then we might ask.

I'm so nervous.
Coco, you can shoot better than me.

And it's just a precaution.

You would not kill me.

What did I do?

Benjamin?

Hornbeck?
Go ahead, Rickles.

Fuck my wife, eh?

You called her when you felt like.
You told her wonderful stories.

And all
behind my back. Why?

Fuck.
That's not the right answer.

Go ahead, Rickles.

Feet.

I put his hands
in the freezer, Senator.

Enough!

Enough? Enough?

This is far from over,
dirty bastard.

We have yet to begin.

Smell that burning flesh.
Smell it.

Because that is the last
you'll smell.

Think about your business and all that money
you did not spend it.

Was it worth it for a few
hours with my wife?

You said you loved her?

She whispered sweet nothings?

Did she say that she night
told me exactly the same?

She did not like you.
Could not.

But she did love you.

Because you're so special,
right?

I gave her.
You respected her.

You respected her,
once a week...

With your cock in her face.
You're disgusting.

Make your excuses, dick.

Why did you kill her?
Because you loved her?

Apologies.

I do not make excuses.
Make your apology.

You're nothing.

I'm so sorry.

911.

My name is Ben Dyson.

Yesterday I kidnapped.

Can you an ambulance
to this address?

Go away.

Go away now.

I stay here.

I want of you.

Please.

I've never seen before.

I do not know who you are.

You get a nice new nose,
really.

An ambulance to
Ellroy Street 551 5.

They send almost everyone.
Where?

Dyson who has just called a 91.

Alive?
When he called it.

551 5?
Which way is it?

Beyond the cemetery.

Your ankle is broken.
Take her to the hospital.

What happened to your ankle?

Why?
Can I borrow your plaster?

Do yourself a favor and 'm
before you really hurt.

Just out of curiosity.
Is there a mop in?

Wax? Sponges?
No horseplay.

Talk to the boss.
I go inside.

This does not happen.
I go inside.

Not at all.
Friedman, now go away.

Otherwise I'll kill you too?

Damn, Friedman.
Let me do my job well.

This is not personal.
And I can tell you why.

Because you are not a person.
I go inside.

This is an FBI investigation,
Detective Grimes.

Thanks for your help.
I will mention in my report.

All units to
Ellroy Street 551 5.

Isla Margarita - three months later

I do not want a rum and coke.

I want a piña colada.

You look like you see a ghost.
Too much.

How you doing, honey?

I'm still alive.

But not you.

Dear Jesus, "what you sow,
ye reap, "they say.

But in life
Not much to harvest.

I learn less and less and there
I always get more regrets.

I have the most dangerous
things done.

Maybe we all a second chance.

Personally I doubt that.
But I will keep you informed.
