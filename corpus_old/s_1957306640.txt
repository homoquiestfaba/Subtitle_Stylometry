[ominous music]

[engine rumbling]

[man speaking Chinese]
What the?!

Get out of my truck!
Get out of my truck!

You think you can
just get a free ride?

Get out of here!

Asshole!


[man speaking Chinese] Who put you
up to this? Why are you doing this?

You could have it easy,
but instead you end up doing this?

Wang?!

Have you lost your mind?

I can't believe it's you!

Who told you to do this?

Your replacement is coming soon.

This is a necessity.

This can't be!

You are my people!

You will not be missed.


[in English] Fuck!

Fuck!

Why don't you just
play the slice?

Oh, so we're going to do one
for each nine, then?

Yes, we are.

I am paying for the round,
I get as many as I want!

Just like you! How many incomplete
classes am I paying for, huh?

All right.

I fucked up, okay? I coasted.

"I co... I coasted"?!

Jesus.
"I co... I coasted."

Look, it's just not
that interesting.



Now, you are not only here
for me to bust your balls,

which I am and you deserve,

but unfortunately I am running
out of money

and I'm gonna need a favor,
which you will do for me.

So...

what...

exactly...

are you proposing?

Gah... damn.

You're going to help me with a housing
project my company... or I'm... doing.

Urban housing development.
Oh, like as an advisor to a project manager or something?

No!

Do you know how to do that?

No!

I would not send you over there
to make me look like a dick.

Get the tee.

So then what would I be doing?

[older man]
<i>You're a substitute for me,</i>

<i>but only your boss
over there knows it.</i>

<i>The others won't know it because
it would make them lose face,</i>

<i>which is basically the worst
possible thing in China.</i>

<i>A fake.</i>

Hello, Mr. Bryan,
my name is Lia.

Charmed to meet you, Lia.

Thank you for taking the time
to come get me.

Your luggage is waiting for you
in your apartment.

Please.

[older man] <i>I know it's strange,
but listen...</i>

<i>These complexes
make tons of cash quickly</i>

<i>once they turn over.</i>

<i>You'll be in another country
on their dime,</i>

<i>they take you around,
show you stuff,</i>

<i>you look good
and say "I approve."</i>

<i>It'll impress their
Chinese investors.</i>

<i>That's the real trick,
that's the rub... again,</i>

<i>almost all of the people
at this company</i>

<i>won't know your role.</i>

<i>Only the guy at the top,
who got you from me.</i>

<i>They are paying you
to be white and look the part;</i>

<i>even you can't
fuck that up, right?</i>

[elevator dings]

This is your assistant,
Mr. Bryan,

Coco Chen.

Nice to meet you!

How are you?

I'm fine, thank you.

You look so handsome...

[clears throat]

I'm looking forward
to work for you.

Uh... anything you need help,
call me, okay?

Okay.

It is my pleasure
to introduce you,

Mr. Wang Lee, your employer.

How do you do?
I'm very well, thank you, Mr. Zellerman.

Welcome to Shanghai.
Please, come with me.

I'm sure you had a long flight.

We are so very glad you could
come to help us.

Well, I'm looking forward to
exceeding your expectations.

Let's not play any games,
Mr. Bryan.

I'm perfectly aware you're not
qualified for this position,

and that is precisely why
the company has hired you.

Frankly, I don't care
what you did at your last job.

I promise
there's nothing I can't handle.

My company is going
through some major changes.

We unfortunately lost our last
managing CFO.

We need a figurehead,
so to speak.

<i>You must simply give the
appearance to the public</i>

<i>of a talented businessman.</i>

<i>If you're asked anything
and don't know the answer,</i>

<i>make something up.
They'll believe you.</i>

<i>Understand?</i>

[no audible dialogue]

how am I so profitable to you?</i>

with your culture, your life.</i>

<i>The West.</i>

<i>Anything they buy becomes
an immediate status symbol.</i>

<i>Just having you next to me</i>

<i>increases the value
of our developments</i>

<i>by 30 percent.</i>

And of course, as you know,
we will compensate you handsomely.

Lia will show you to your
new accommodation.

Have a good evening.

And they say you can't get by
on your looks.

[automated voice in Chinese]
[disconnect tone]

[line rings]
[automated voice] <i>We're sorry,</i>

[line rings]

[line rings]

you've reached Jerry Khave.</i>

<i>I'm unable to take your call
right now,</i>

<i>but leave a message and I'll
get back to you.</i> [beeps]

Jerry.

Jerry.

I don't know if you're
going to get this.

This is probably the last time
that you're going to hear from me.

I don't know
what the fuck happened, man,

I mean, the...
the police came in, they...

I mean, they tried to arrest me.
I did everything that you told me.

I did exactly what you
told me to do, Jerry!

I need your help.

I want to go home.

I just want to go home.


[faint disconnect tone]

[siren wails in distance]


[siren wailing in distance]

Go on, get out of here.

Come on, fuck off.

[dog barking]

[barking continues]

[people shouting faintly]

[woman speaking Chinese]
Is that ready yet?

[man shouting in Chinese] What?!
Oh, yeah?! Foreigner going left, huh?!

Just great! Take it!
Foreigner thief! So good!

[in English] Hey!
[in Chinese] Can I have some?

[in English] Now go on,
get outta here.

Get out!

[train rumbles]
[indistinct chatter]

Hey!

[in Chinese] What, foreigner?

[in English]
What did he just say?

He said that you're
a foreigner.

Oh, so that's what "laowai" means?
How you know?

Because that's the only thing people
say consistently when they see me,

so, "Hey, you laowai, why are you
wiping your sweaty face on my arm?"

[in Chinese] I fuck your mother,
you idiot!

Where are we going?

is waiting for us

in one of the company's
holdings.

And you're sure this is
the best way to get there?

Mm-hmm.

enjoying yourself so far.


What do you think of our new
luxury condo, Mr. Bryan?

Well, it's beautiful.

How many does it hold?

About 20,000,

but that's nothing
compared to the one

we're building
across the street.

That one will fit
about twice as many.

The newly rich Chinese
love things like these:

stadiums, parks, luxury condos,

anything they can
burn their money on.

You know,
you do good here,

you'll be rewarded.

You are quite the honest
businessman.

See that house down there?

Our company bought
the whole block, but...

sometimes people won't leave.
[dog barking]

We call them nail houses.

So, how do you get rid of them?

You can pry them out
or hammer them in.

We always find a way.

What about the people
you remove?

[in Chinese] Come out!

Come out!

You know you can't do this,
this house has belonged

to my family for generations.
We paid!

You can't do anything about it!

This is illegal!
I have my rights!

Shut up! Get him outside!
[grunts]

[man 1] You can't!
[man 2] Shut up!

Shut up!

[in English] Food? [grunts]

Can you understand
what I'm saying?

I'm... I'm very hungry.


[chicken clucking]

[voicemail beeps]


<i>I don't know if
you're getting this.</i>

<i>You're in trouble.</i>

<i>The company you're working for
is being investigated for fraud.</i>

<i>They don't take kindly to
this type of shit.</i>

<i>People... disappear.</i>

<i>We need to get you out of
there.</i>

<i>I wish there was
something I could do.</i>

<i>Please... don't...</i>

<i>contact me again.</i>

[indistinct chatter]
[horns honking]

[man in Chinese]
Hey, what's going on here?

What are you doing here?

[Bryan in English] Go on!

Fuck outta here!

[man in Chinese]
Yeah? You want some?

Come on! Get him!
[grunting]

[elevator dings]

Welcome to your new apartment.

We have four bedrooms,

five bathrooms,

forty-eight hundred square feet.

So from the 36th floor,

we have an unbeatable view

for the Shanghai International
Financial Center

and the Pearl Tower.

So is there anything else
I can help you with?

Well, this seems like a cause
for celebration.

What do you say we go inside
and have a drink?

[upbeat music]

[horns honking]

[music continues]
[indistinct chatter]

Thank you for your wonderful job
getting us in here.

You're going to do very,
very well for yourself!

You don't have to be serious,
everything doesn't have to be so serious,

we can have fun!

[no audible dialogue]

[music continues]

want to see me there?</i>

Yes... I see you soon, okay?

Are you okay?

[music continues]

[people shouting faintly]

[can clatters]


[woman shouting in Chinese] This is
what young people should be taking!

Who asked him to rob my store?
[woman 2] Wait! Wait! Hold on a second.

This damn thief!
He's a foreigner!

Hey, foreigner, where are you from?!
It's nothing... hold on...

What is your name?

What is your name?

[in English] I-I don't know...
I don't know...

[in Chinese] This thief is a spy!
I want him out of...

He's not a spy!
He can't even speak Chinese!

[in English] Please.
Please.

[in Chinese] It's okay, you can go.
It's okay.

Are you okay?
[in English] Thank you. [in Chinese] Thank you.

[in Chinese] You're good, huh?

[Chinese on PA]
<i>I'm picking up boxes!</i>

<i>Recycle your boxes here,
I'll take them!</i>

[announcement continues]

[in Chinese]
Are you feeling better?

You want to eat something?

Eat something?

Eat?

[in English] Yes.

[in Chinese] Thank you.

[Bryan chuckles]

[woman chuckles]

[in Chinese] Yuen-Ling, have you
found out where he's from yet?

[in Chinese] Thank you.
Why isn't he showing his face anywhere?

Why is he hiding?

[in Chinese] My name is
Yuen-Ling.

Yuen-Ling.

[broken Chinese]
My... name... is... Yuen-Ling!

You see? He's an idiot.

My name is Yuen-Ling?

Yuen-Ling!
Yuen-Ling!

Ah. Yuen-Ling.
Uh... Yuen-Ling?

Me. Understand.
[broken Chinese] Ah, my name is Bryan.

Oh! You...

Bry... Bryeh... Bryan?

Bryan. [chuckles]
Bryan.

[in English] Yes, yes! Yes.

Nice to meet you.

[both laugh]

[horn honking]

[broken Chinese]
One... two... three...

four...

five...

six. Huh.
Understand.

[in English]
One... two... three...

[in Chinese] Wait... Wait...
don't go so fast for me...

[in English] One...
[broken English] One...

two...
two...

Two...
Two...

[in Chinese] Good, good.
[both laugh]

[broken Chinese]
This... how do you say...

...that?

Dice.
Dice?

You listen. Sha...

Sha... izi.
Izi.

Sha izi.
Sha izi.

[in English] Aha. Dice.

Dice.
Dice. [in Chinese] Good... good!

This... how do you say...

...that?

This? Water.

Water?
Water.

Water! Water.
Water.

[both laugh]

[Yuen-Ling in Chinese]
<i>Where are you from? Where from?</i>

[Bryan in Chinese]
<i>Where from... uh...</i>

[grunts]
[Bryan in English] <i>From, uh... America!</i>

<i>But I was in, uh, Shanghai.</i>

<i>Shanghai?</i>
[Yuen-Ling] <i>Shanghai?</i>

<i>Shanghai.</i>
[Yuen-Ling] <i>Oh!</i> [chuckles]

[in Chinese] Like this...
We always shake hands like this.

[in English] Hey!

[broken Chinese] Up high! Up high!
[man laughs]

[indistinct chatter]

[dice rattling]

[in Chinese] Three fives.

No... five... five of...

Ah! You cannot!
You can only say it once!

Ah, um...

Five threes.

Five...

Six... Six threes.

Seven threes.
Seven threes?

Uh...
[giggles]

Four of them. Three of them. Yay!
[both chuckle]


[horn honks]

[in English]
So, you speak Chinese?

I mean, you read Chinese.

No.

Why'd you take this job then?

I'm glad I can't read this.

Shh.
[chuckles] Oh... I'm sorry.


You're efficient, Mr. Bryan.

Guilty!

Is there any way you could...

brief me?
Tonight before the meeting?

I would be happy to.
You can come with me, please.

[boat horn blares]

so quickly here.

It's very foggy today.

Everything changes so quickly,

and unfortunately
this is not a fog.

Oh.
Mr. Bryan, you can see the office from here, look.


Very impressive.

Yeah, sure.

Do you not like your job?

It's okay! You can tell me.

I've worked plenty
of jobs that I hated.

The company you work for
built this place,

I think you've done something
right to be here today.

But it does take
a certain type of person

to do what we do, does it not?

Come along.

white people are like celebrities here.

you can be a fake white anything.

not pretending to be a doctor.


Isn't this... totally unethical?

Are you complaining?

realize it was so normal.</i>

<i>Does it bother you?</i>


<i>everything you see in China
is fake anyway.</i>



We own factories,
shipping depots,

almost everything.

like they live here.</i>

successful.</i>


above this factory</i>

<i>and work six days per week.</i>

They are skilled laborers,
they get paid more than day laborers,

uh, but they still
cannot work in the offices.

Well, that doesn't seem fair.

They don't mind
if they don't know

that an alternative exists.

Don't these people
rarely interact

with anyone outside of
their own little world?

It is the most efficient method.

The Chinese have been
employing this way

for a thousand years.

producing here?

Boxes mostly,
for shipping our commodities.

Ah, that's very interesting
to see it in action.

This is where the magic
happens.

You'll be pleased to hear
your replacement is working.

We'll start in a week.

Tomorrow.

Excuse me? Are you advising
me or telling me what to do?

Our original plans were to start
days from now.

Well, the plans
have gotta change, hadn't they?

You really think
they're not watching us

this very fucking second?

[camera shutter clicks]
The documents will be released tomorrow.

We've already harvested his
signatures and his fingerprints.

[man in Chinese]
I've never seen this guy before.

[woman in Chinese] They didn't hide,
none of our cameras were blocked.

It's like they don't care
suddenly.

They're brazenly
strutting around...

it's like they don't care
we're monitoring them.

Their patterns have
changed recently.

Now it's meeting after meeting,
it's strange.

It used to be just once a week.

Except for last weekend when he
left for the mountains alone,

he's constantly under the guard
of that mean-looking foreigner.

The new manager
of their company was seen

leaving this foreigner's
apartment the other day.

the surveillance records.

I don't know who
they're working for,

but I'm sure that other American
in the suit, I believe...

he's the key
to unlock this puzzle.

[in English] Make sure they find
him, not you!

Don't fuck this up!

Don't want to take another
trip to the country, do we?

You still here?

[vehicle approaching]

[horn honks]

[in Chinese] Hop on!
[in English] Bad idea.

[in Chinese] Don't worry!

[Bryan in English] Where are we going?
To my old neighborhood.

[no audible dialogue]

[indistinct chatter]

[in English]
What do you call this?

Yia me gur.
Yia me gur.

[in English] Good?

[in Chinese] It's pronounced
"jia mei gur."

[in Chinese] Take it?
[in Chinese] Take it.

Take it?

[indistinct chatter]

[in Chinese] Try it?

[in English] It's good.
[in Chinese] Try it.

You give it to him.
[in Chinese] Thank you.

[broken English] Thank you.
[in Chinese] Thank you!

[broken English] Thank you!
[in Chinese] Thank you.


[woman in Chinese] Eight or
four, buy eight or four!

[indistinct chatter]


[in Chinese] Do you Americans have or not?
Mm...

[in Chinese] Smells good!
[in Chinese] Smells good?

Smells good. Ah.
Smells good.

[in English] Tell him.
[in Chinese] Smells good!

[in English]
No, not interested.

[in English] You have to say it louder.
Louder?

[in Chinese]
Smells good, master!

Always smells good!
[in Chinese] Smells good, master!

[in Chinese]
Today, you eat these two,

but when you go
back to America,

you won't be able to get
this good of food!

[no audible dialogue]

[Yuen-Ling in English] Meat.

[in English] Meat!
Meat... uh, dry.

Spicy? Hot?
Yeah, one.

[in Chinese] One! Yes, one, please.
Yeah, with that... and that...

Do you want meat or no meat?
Uh, yeah.

And this you'd like?
A little bit.

A little bit.

[Yuen-Ling in English] You like?
[Bryan] Uh-huh.

[Bryan chuckle]

[Bryan in English]
Is that... meat?

[in Chinese] Great, thank you!

[in Chinese] How much?
[in Chinese] Three kwai.

[indistinct chatter]

[in English] Oh, what, now you don't want it?
[laughing]

Ooh!

[in English] Do your parents
know that you're dating a laowai?

[in English] Me?!
Yeah, you!

Laowai?
Laowai, yeah, you and laowai!

Let's see...

[horn honks]

[truck honking]

[in Chinese] Hurry, let's go.

[engine revs]

[Yuen-Ling in Chinese]
Why did we come here?

[in Chinese] Don't worry about it.
Don't worry?

I don't like this.

[in English] Uncle said
he worked here before...

[in English] Your uncle,
he worked here?

[in Chinese] Yeah.
At this company?

[in Chinese] Yeah.
Let's go. Let's go.

He told me not to come here.
[in English] Okay-la, okay.

[in Chinese] I'm not getting
much cooperation here.

Pull up the footage of
all the entrances and exits.

[in Chinese] We've looked at that
footage for the entire day, sir.

We never saw him use any
of the entrances or exits.

Re-checking three times.

Can we please check once more?

You've lost track
of people before,

so what's the harm in reviewing
one more time?

It's been two weeks!
If I took another look,

I guarantee that
I will find something!

I'll wait.
Sir, that footage you asked for a week ago,

it's here.
From which cameras?

When the car carrying Wang Zhou
last left Shanghai

got spotted and you wanted
to know who was with him.

[monitor trilling]


All of these are
construction sites.

Cross-reference this list
in our database.


[in English] Oh, shit.

[in Chinese] I didn't notice this before!
These are all locations

where evicted residents have
been reported missing.

We need to capture
this foreigner immediately!

[in English]
Good morning, laowai.

[in Chinese]
Zaoshang hao, laowai.

[both chuckle]

[in English]
Today is a special day.

[in English] Special day?

You don't like my beard?

Um...

Mm...
[chuckles]

Too much, too much.

No. Hao, hao!

Hmm? Hmm?

[In Chinese] Thank you.
[In Chinese] Listen to this.

[broken English]
Today, we two... two...

go train station.

[in English] Train, train?
[in English] Train, train.

[in Chinese] Oh, good! Good!

Good-a?
Mm!

Good-a!
[chuckles]

[indistinct chatter]

[Yuen-Ling in English] Today
is a special day, remember?

[Bryan in English] Why?
[Yuen-Ling] We are going to a place with no people.

[Bryan in English] Holy shit.

Are we still in China?
[in Chinese] I like it here.

[in English] Holy shit.


[Yuen-Ling in English]
Keep umbrella up!

[in English] Why?
If no umbrella, hair fall out!


There's no noise.

[in Chinese] Yeah, I like it.

[Bryan in English] I can see
why, this place is beautiful.

[in Chinese] So you never told
me, what brought you to China?

[in Chinese] Um... I don't know.

near here?

[Yuen-Ling in Chinese] We had
already moved to this area.

When I was a kid,
this place didn't even look

like a town back then.

[Bryan in Chinese] Ah, uh...
Was that good or bad?

[in Chinese] It was fine.
[in Chinese] It was fine.

But I don't like the city much.

[Yuen-Ling in English]
When I was little,

my parents have no money.

So I can only read books.

That's how I fix your leg.

[in English] A laowai doctor!
[in Chinese] Big money, big money!

[in English] You are the first person
that has ever been truly kind to me.


[in English] Do you understand?

[no audible dialogue]

Why did you help me?

You were hurt and sad,

that's why I'll help you.

[no audible dialogue]

[Bryan in English]
I wish this was my real life.

[Yuen-Ling in English]
What is your real life?

I don't want to tell you.

[Yuen-Ling]
You have to tell me sometime.


[in Chinese]
Don't worry, don't worry.

[Yuen in broken English]
My family no like.

They want a normal life for me.
They don't like you.

[Bryan in English] Well,
your father never met me, so...

What is, what is he like?

[Yuen-Ling] He's old.
He works too much.

Now he's working somewhere...
Oh.

...in another city.
Is he far away?

[Yuen-Ling] Yes, yes.
It's normal in China.

We don't see our parents.
Only once a year.

[indistinct chatter]

[in English] Hey! Hey!
How are you?

[barks]
Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh.

You're a good boy.
You're a good boy!

You're okay.
You're okay.

Yeah, there you are.
There you are, pup.

There you are, pup, how are you?

How are you?
Good boy!

Good boy! Okay.
Bye-bye!

[Lee in Chinese] Everything that they
want I've got on me here at the factory.

[in English] What do you mean
you haven't found him yet?

What am I paying you for?

I don't care,
just make it happen!

[indistinct chatter]

[siren wailing in distance]

[siren wailing in distance]

[in English] Hey!
[in English] Hey!

[in Chinese] How are you? What did you
do last night? [in English] You okay?

[in English] Yeah, I'm okay.
Um...

I need to talk to you, though.

[people yelling faintly]

[in English] Later?
[in English] Yeah.

[Yuen-Ling in Chinese]
Very good food.

[broken English] Favorite restaurant.
Best restaurant?

[Bryan in English] Yeah, yeah.
[in Chinese] This way.

It's my favorite restaurant.
[in Chinese] Good. Got it, got it.

[in Chinese] It's this way.
[in Chinese] Good. Got it, got it.

[siren chirps]

[in English] Um... let's go,
let's go back this way.

[in Chinese]
No, it's over there!

[in English] Yeah, no, no,
come on, I mean it.

[Yuen-Ling in English]
Wait, stop!

[traditional music playing]

[Yuen-Ling in English] Wait!

What happened?
[in Chinese] What are you doing?

[in English]
Why are you like this?

[in English] There's people
who are looking for me.

[in Chinese] What? Who... Police?
[in English] No! No, no, no.

I didn't do anything,
but the company that I worked for

is the same company as your
father, and they lied.

They said that I did things,

but I didn't do them.
I didn't do anything.

That's how I came to your shop.

[in Chinese] Really?

Really?
[in English] Yes, I promise.

[in Chinese] You better not be lying to me.
[in English] I promise.


[in English] My family can help
you get out of the country...

if that's what you want.

[in English] Really?
I can help you.

[in Chinese] I can help get you out.
[in English] Oh, my God,

you have no idea what that means to me.
Thank you.

[in English] Go.

[in English] If I make it,
you can come visit me.

[in English] My place is here.

I'll miss you, you know?

Yeah, I'm gonna miss you too.

Maybe if I...
Stay away, you cannot help.

Goodbye.

[automated voice in Chinese] <i>The

[in Chinese] Where to?

Where going?

[in English] Sorry?
You can, come on!

No, no, no no.
I have someone coming.

Nah, nah, come on.

[dramatic music]

[siren wailing]

[in English] What the hell
are you doing here?

What do you mean?
[scoffs]

People are looking for you,
you're on the news, on the TV!

What are you talking about?
Who is looking for me?

What are you talking about,
Coco?!

What... talk to me!

[in Chinese] <i>...while the American
markets continue to plummet.</i>

<i>This is Feng Mien reporting. Today,
a real estate company is under review</i>

<i>for the illegal confiscation of...</i>
[in English] Oh, shit.

<i>...property from legal owners
who had been forcefully evicted</i>

<i>by company agents.</i>

<i>This is the main suspect
in the case,</i>

<i>an American investor who had
taken responsibility is wanted.</i>

[in English] Oh, shit!
What did you do, Mr. Bryan?!

I don't know,
I didn't do anything!

You mean you're innocent?!

Yes! Yes, I'm innocent!

You need to get out of here,
okay?

Right now!

You need help.
Yes!

Uh, um... [exhales]

Uh, okay. Okay,
but you have to do everything that I say,

exactly what I say. Okay?
Okay!

[Coco in Chinese] He is here!
Everyone come look!

He sent me an email!
Quick, come look!

The foreigner just sent me
an email, come look!

That foreigner sent me an email!

[in Chinese]
He's heading for the stairs!

Um...

[man in Chinese]
He's on 23! He's on 23!

[in English] Hey! Hey! Hey!

Go! Go! Go!

[engine revs]
[tires screech]

[sirens wailing]

[man speaking Chinese over radio]
<i>You have to stay tight onto him!</i>

[Bryan in English]
Come on, faster! faster!

[man speaking Chinese over radio]
<i>You have to stay tight onto him!</i>

[tires screech]
[horn honks]


[man over radio] <i>He's heading for
the market. Don't get in an accident!</i>

[Bryan in Chinese] Thank you!

[in Chinese] Did you spot him?
[in Chinese] No, no sight of him.

All units head back to the other
entrances, he must have doubled back!

[engine turns off]

[in Chinese] Hey! Hey! Hey!
Wait! Wait!

[in Chinese]
I am American owner!

Okay, show me ID if you can!
Fuck me!

Oh.

Oh. Oh! Got it.
Okay, got it. Okay.

[in Chinese]
What the hell is all this?

[in English] I thought this
company was bankrupt,

what are all these boxes
doing here?

[man in Chinese] This stuff has
been here for years.

[in English] Somebody should
be fired for that,

it's probably some asshole
in Shanghai.

[in Chinese] This way, boss.

[in Chinese] I knew that.

[in Chinese] Are the relocation
records in this office?

Boss, this is just an
administrator's office.

The other records
are in other files.

Go get them!
Okay.

[in Chinese] Hello.

[in Chinese] Hello.
[in Chinese] Yes, hello.

Yeah.
My name is Detective Cheng.

You called us about
a foreigner, is this him?

You can see here.

Yes! That's him!
That's him!

You're sure he's the one?
I'm sure.

When was the last time
you saw him?

Tonight! He took my daughter
out somewhere!

My daughter stupidly
fell for his tricks!

Oh.
[phone rings]

Yes?

[Bryan speaking Chinese
over phone] <i>Hello!</i>

It's him!
Detective, it's him!

Yes? Hello.
Ni hao, Detective.

[in English] What are you
doing, calling me like this?

[in English] I'm not the person that
you're looking for, but you know that.

Who should I be after,
Mr. Bryan?

Come to the factory on Bei
Yuan Road by the river,

I'll tell you there.

[in English]
Go search this address.

<i>Find out why he's there.</i>

[in Chinese] Wait Wait! Wait!
You can't come in,

this is private property!

[in Chinese] I'm a detective.
Okay, what do you want?

Have you seen anybody strange
come through here recently?

Oh. There was this guy,
a foreigner boss

who came through,
but he had paperwork and permission.

Where did he go?
He should be coming back any second.

I think somebody's coming.

Stop!
I didn't do anything!

This is where you left him?
Yes, sir.

DINGZIHU - HOLDOUT PROPERTY LIST

"REMOVED"

[indistinct PA announcement]

[automated voice] <i>Now arriving,
Shanghai Hongqiao Station.</i>

[line ringing]

[line ringing]

[Cheng in Chinese] <i>Yes? Yes?
Hello?</i>

[in English] Mr. Zellerman,
fancy meeting you here.

[in Chinese]
I didn't want to meet like this.

[in Chinese] Why do you make it
sound so dramatic, foreigner?

How did you get these?

What about the other stand-ins?
The last CFO?

You killed him?

Your partner?

[in English] Actually I killed
that fucking cunt.

I've been waiting for you.
Come on!

[in Chinese] To the roof!
Quietly.

[in English] You must've gone to
a lot of trouble to get these.

[in English] It was less
trouble than it should've been.

How have you been pulling
this off for so long?

As you said, it was less
trouble than it should've been.

This laowai's quite clever!

Give me his phone.

You know, as surprised as I
am that you're still alive,

I was even more shocked...

Fucking-A.

Who the fuck have you been
speaking to?

Who the fuck are you?!
Who the fuck am I?!

[thuds]
[grunts]

Don't think you're getting away
with this shit,

it's not how it
fucking works, mate.

Kill him!

He doesn't like the nasty bits,
still a bit squeamish.

Just me and you now.

I should've put an end to you
a long time ago.

Then why am I still alive?

Good question!

[in Chinese] Police! He's got a gun!
[gunfire]


[in Chinese] He's gone.

[in English] You got my call?
[in English] Yes.

Are you gonna uncuff me now?

No.

[in English] Where am I?

[in English]
You are charged with fraud

and grand theft from the people.

If you had no business with it,
why did you run?

You don't even know who I am.

She told us a great deal
about you.

So then why am I
still sitting here?

How did you know Wang
before this?

I had never met him before.

But you seem to think...
I had no idea

what his plans were
before you tried to arrest me,

and I let him almost kill me
so that you could find him.

Does that sound like somebody
who's guilty to you?

How would you like
to see her again?

We would like you to help us.

In return,
we can offer you a clean slate.

From where I was
standing before,

that might have seemed
appealing.

But I'm standing over here
now...

and if I have to stand trial,
I will.

But I am not
going to be leaned on.

Very well.
